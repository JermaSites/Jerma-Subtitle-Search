[06:38.38]Does anybody have any more questions before we go?
[06:41.74]I've never played this, so we're going to do our best.
[06:44.80]No, dude.
[06:46.20]Okay, Esfand.
[06:48.12]Is Bonnie here?
[06:50.22]She should be.

[06:54.42]Oh, yeah.
[06:55.48]Okay, Esfand, I'm going to give you the tutorial.
[06:59.45]Sandbox mode.
[07:02.03]That's it.
[07:03.13]That's all I have time to tell you.
[07:04.19]Okay.
[07:04.85]Sick.

[07:21.42]No, we're good.
[07:21.93]I got it.
[07:22.49]Just to let you know, Esfand, you can't get lower than a D minus.
[07:25.73]I just want to make sure that's clear.
[07:27.61]That's pretty bad.
[07:28.29]Wait, really?
[07:28.97]60 to 100.
[07:29.91]That's a bad grade.
[07:31.45]Nobody fails.
[07:32.33]There's no failing.
[07:33.09]D-minus is a passing grade.
[07:35.75]No, it's not.
[07:36.59]D-minus is a failing grade.
[07:38.03]No, it isn't.
[07:38.69]What are you talking about?
[07:40.20]That's a pass here.
[07:41.44]What do you mean?
[07:43.84]D-minus?
[07:45.44]Yes.
[07:46.04]Guys, I got a D-minus.
[07:48.28]I got a D-minus like half my entire educational life.
[07:51.04]Like, and I passed.
[07:51.71]That's awesome.
[07:54.95]That's America.

[07:59.57]Yeah, can you give, uh, what, what's the, uh, username?
[08:04.21]Bless you.
[08:05.61]Can you put the, uh, Bonnie's username in the bathroom chat?
[08:10.04]Uh, yes.
[08:10.40]I know, that sounds fucking weird to say out loud.
[08:12.12]Yeah, everyone's probably just confused, like, someone, someone, he's, he's in the toilet, can you just pop the message in?

[10:15.50]Sorry.
[10:16.20]Hey!
[10:17.15]Hey Bonnie.
[10:18.27]How's it going?
[10:19.83]So now that she's here, that doesn't exactly apply, but pretty close.
[10:26.45]It's all good.
[10:27.25]This is all for fun.
[10:28.53]There's no stakes.
[10:30.77]You guys will be alright.
[10:33.05]Cool.
[10:33.77]But very important.
[10:35.25]So you're on teams of two.
[10:37.17]Each one of you is going to get a prompt for this first two builds.
[10:42.91]Who among you would like to be player A?
[10:45.66]Define that out right now.
[10:47.68]As I open your wonderful presents.
[10:50.30]Squeaks, I'll take guest.
[10:53.38]I'm a player A. I'm happy to be the A player.
[10:56.20]Can you be player A?
[10:57.96]Joel, what do you think?
[10:58.93]Should I do player A?
[10:59.59]A player, if you will.
[11:00.63]What do you think, Doug?
[11:01.57]You'll go first because I have no skills.
[11:03.61]Okay.
[11:05.11]Will, how strong are you feeling?
[11:06.17]You seem less confident in this.
[11:07.37]It's funny if you go first.
[11:08.31]Snuffy, whatever you want to do, I'll do the opposite.
[11:12.41]Really?
[11:14.53]Is this the first build that counts 10 then?
[11:16.28]Like the player A?
[11:17.48]Or do we work together on the first 10% one?
[11:19.82]So whoever is player A is doing this build alone.
[11:24.66]Oh.
[11:25.88]But we can have like the people in our ear, right?
[11:28.46]Absolutely.
[11:29.65]Yeah.
[11:30.17]You sound confident and my hands are the worst part of my body.
[11:34.61]My mind is what people want me for anyway.
[11:37.66]Okay, so you were going to have the creative vision then, right?
[11:41.36]I got the juice, yeah.
[11:43.65]My hands look like this, so his can look like that.
[11:47.25]Exactly.
[11:48.47]Are we ready?
[11:50.13]Yeah.
[11:50.89]Sure.
[11:51.37]Prompt number one is going to be either naughty or nice.
[11:57.95]Oh.
[11:59.23]Okay.
[11:59.55]Naughty or nice.
[12:00.45]That's the theme of the first build?
[12:02.66]No, the theme of both.
[12:03.80]Whoever picks naughty is giving nice to the other person.
[12:08.81]By the way, this is just fun theming.
[12:13.07]Well, we'll see.
[12:16.43]Do we stream this in the art section or in House Flipper 2?
[12:19.31]I would go in House Flipper 2.
[12:20.97]Depends on your build, S-Man.
[12:24.00]Can we quickly confer as a team and discuss our options?
[12:27.32]All of you should confer right now which one of you is nice.
[12:30.00]This should be nine people telling me they're nice, and I don't care who it is, but I'm going to give you that prompt in about, hey, you got 30 seconds.
[12:37.36]Go for it.
[12:37.92]Doug, I think I'm more of a nice guy.
[12:42.17]I want to be naughty.
[12:44.55]You're naughty.
[12:45.45]Go ahead, Joel.
[12:47.09]What would you like?
[12:47.75]I want to be bad.
[12:48.43]Do you want to be naughty, NL?
[12:54.04]Just kneecapped my build.
[12:55.26]Alright, gotcha.
[12:56.84]So, naughty or nice?
[12:57.92]Bonnie.
[13:00.12]You be...
[13:04.32]Okay, cool.
[13:05.02]No, good idea.
[13:05.66]Yeah, good plan.
[13:07.38]Sounds good.
[13:08.22]Okay, got it.
[13:11.87]Wait, Northernlion, you want to be naughty?
[13:13.15]Or nice?
[13:14.43]Hey, I need to be nice.
[13:16.41]Okay.
[13:17.47]Oh, no.
[13:18.45]I've been practicing my light side build.
[13:20.43]I could be your angel or your devil.
[13:22.51]No, I'm not in a fat suit.
[13:23.57]I just got fat.
[13:24.47]That's it.
[13:24.93]I'm sorry.
[13:25.33]I'm talking to my chat.
[13:26.97]Where are you posting?
[13:29.35]This is between the two of you.
[13:30.75]Room nine.
[13:31.77]So you guys, wait, don't go anywhere yet.
[13:35.73]I'm going to give you the prompt.
[13:36.99]I haven't given you the prompt yet.
[13:39.35]No, the prompt is not nice.
[13:40.95]The prompt is inside of this beautiful card.
[13:42.71]Oh.
[13:44.25]Oh, no.
[13:46.11]Oh, yeah, that card.
[13:48.49]Why are we pitting streamers against each other?
[13:50.71]Because it's only one.
[13:53.75]Alright, you should all have a player A right now, and they should be nice.
[13:57.37]Whoever you are, your prompt is.
[13:58.99]Okay.
[14:01.80]Oh.
[14:02.26]Oh.
[14:02.54]Oh.
[14:05.39]If you are player A, listen, quiet!
[14:06.83]If you are player A, get into that pre-built that exists right now.
[14:28.36]Are all the player A's in the pre-build?
[14:30.70]Sir, me or you?
[14:34.69]Do I have to get a zip to get into the pre-build?
[14:36.79]Oh my god.
[14:37.47]Hold on.
[14:38.65]That zip is in the chat.
[14:39.87]It's pinned.
[14:41.43]Oh god.
[14:42.01]Okay.
[14:42.37]Go.
[14:42.99]Go.
[14:43.17]Hey, it's alright.
[14:44.33]I plotted out 10 minutes for the intro.
[14:45.84]We're good.
[14:46.96]There's a zip.
[14:48.30]Which chat is it in?
[14:49.58]Is it in bathroom?
[14:50.62]Bathroom upload.
[14:51.88]Oh yeah.
[14:52.92]There's a pin in bathroom chat.
[14:55.41]I wrote paragraphs.
[14:56.73]I had, I had, I had, I got all kinds of knowledge for everybody.
[15:03.70]The 10 minutes are up.
[15:04.60]No, we're still in 10 minutes.
[15:06.92]Wait, is it called germos sauce?
[15:10.30]What?
[15:11.40]No.

[15:16.22]Okay.
[15:16.86]We'll, we'll go to the bathroom.
[15:18.84]Go to the bathroom and click on the pins and it'll be up in the pins.
[15:22.38]It's a zip file in the pins.
[15:26.20]It's invitational build a room, right?
[15:29.24]Or is that build a room or build a room?
[15:30.98]Build a room.
[15:32.14]By the way, both of you are using this exact same template for both of these prompts.
[15:35.65]So, are we ready?
[15:37.07]Almost.
[15:39.65]Well, I'm gonna give you the prompt.
[15:40.89]Well, actually, no I'm not.
[15:42.48]No, no, no, no, no, no, we're not, no, we're not.

[16:02.40]Okay.
[16:02.92]And then on the top right, there's an import.
[16:04.60]It's going to open up like a file explorers.
[16:06.38]Just be aware of that.
[16:07.58]You're going to click that zip.
[16:08.90]Don't open it.
[16:09.98]Don't it's just a zip.
[16:11.13]You only need the zip.

[20:34.39]Okay, thank you so much.
[20:35.97]Hey, hey, what's up dude?
[20:37.53]Back in the main channel for a second.
[20:38.99]I forgot to say something incredibly important.
[20:41.32]Oh, okay.
[20:43.38]Hey, back in the main channel, back in the main channel, back in the main channel.
[20:45.42]This is the work of Judas for sure.
[20:46.66]It's doing the thing again.
[20:48.44]Back in the main channel, I forgot to say something very important.
[20:50.30]Back in the main channel.
[20:51.60]Okay, I need to turn off the fucking Phil Collins.
[20:54.42]You still have Phil Collins?
[20:55.32]Alright, back in the main channel.
[20:57.48]Back in the main channel, back in the main channel, back in the main channel.
[20:59.68]What?
[21:00.26]I forgot to say this.
[21:01.14]Back in the main channel.
[21:01.74]It's very important.
[21:03.40]I didn't say this.
[21:03.90]It's very important.
[21:09.60]A lot of you probably just... Alright, here we go.
[21:11.76]Listen.
[21:13.12]A lot of you... I didn't say this.
[21:14.36]We're going to restart because it's only been like a minute or two.
[21:17.06]You have to click edit, not play when you open that file.
[21:20.53]Edit, not play.
[21:21.49]When you click play, make sure you're hitting edit.
[21:24.47]Is it easier to edit than to play?
[21:26.21]It's the way you have to do it.
[21:27.17]Do not click play.
[21:32.52]so when you go to like when you property browser friends right like uh like mods right you when you open that file there's a play do not click play click edit property is it controversial to say I don't see edit but I see delete and play or is that because I've already played it just just open it just to restart we're just gonna restart once you've already played sure you hit play and then you can edit yeah but we'll just restart because it's only been like two okay that's fine
[22:00.27]I was under the impression that you just went into each one of these rooms just to fuck with us.
[22:05.31]No, no.
[22:06.83]Because I feel like half of you are using the paint can.
[22:10.91]Alright.
[22:11.39]Edit property.
[22:11.91]You guys got it?
[22:12.41]We good?
[22:13.07]Let's restart.
[22:13.93]Same prompt.
[22:14.86]Player A, you're doing dinner.
[22:16.04]Probably have some decent ideas.
[22:18.86]And what is player B doing?
[22:20.02]Just watching.
[22:20.70]Just hanging out with you in the call.
[22:22.50]Just having a good time.
[22:24.48]Okay.
[22:24.90]We good?
[22:25.94]Yep.
[22:26.82]Resetting.
[22:27.60]Get back into your groups and we are going to go in three, two, one, go.
[22:32.78]There we go.
[22:34.38]We had to restart that.
[22:35.26]We had to.
[22:35.74]Because there's no way it would have been disadvantaged so much.
[22:39.04]But it's fine.
[22:39.34]It's been like two minutes.
[22:39.88]It's been like three minutes.
[22:40.80]We're good.
[22:42.76]Alright, so this is what they're using.
[22:46.09]This is cute, isn't it?
[22:46.75]Did you screw it up?
[22:49.67]Hey, this is the warm-ups.
[22:50.93]This isn't even the real thing.
[22:52.89]These are the warm-ups.
[22:54.79]That's why I did that specifically so Build 3 was perfectly executed.
[23:03.03]You like my shirt?
[23:07.52]OK, so I will show you.
[23:10.32]So House Flipper 2 lets you do sandbox mode, which is ridiculous because you can noclip now.
[23:17.84]Those of you that were wondering like, hey, man, I don't know if 20 minutes is enough.
[23:21.03]It might be too short for stuff like this.
[23:24.21]90 minutes, I'll give them like two hours.
[23:27.21]It's not like, for instance, take a look.
[23:30.11]So if I do surface finishes.
[23:34.49]And I open up the materials.
[23:36.49]This is every single material that's in the entire game.
[23:39.16]All of them.
[23:42.24]I can change the color.
[23:43.38]I can change the patterns.
[23:45.92]And then all you need to do... There's no more... Look at this.
[23:53.51]Done.
[23:55.50]This allows everybody to actually spend time designing and not, like, getting 25 paint- That's why everybody had to be in edit mode.
[24:05.24]If you were in play mode, you'd have to buy 30 paint cans and paint the house.
[24:10.46]Super important distinction.
[24:11.72]So, glad we restarted.
[24:14.27]You look like a founding father.
[24:15.31]What happened to the ponytail?
[24:16.25]Where is it?
[24:22.91]That lasted 13 minutes.
[24:27.59]But yeah, I'm very excited, as you can probably tell.
[24:31.73]Where is this, like, scrunchie?
[24:37.31]Can anybody see it?
[24:41.44]I need a haircut so bad, I know.
[24:46.32]But yeah, let's do this, right?
[24:47.66]And here's another cool thing.
[24:51.38]You just remove walls.
[24:55.31]You can make pretty much anything in sandbox mode.
[25:02.43]Don't get a haircut.
[25:03.05]That's the devil talking.
[25:06.48]So is Connor alone?
[25:09.84]Hey, well, CDawg, if you show up, your build is coming up next in like 30 minutes.
[25:26.62]Don't cut it.
[25:28.42]Eh, we will see.
[25:30.96]But dinner is the prompt.
[25:33.52]I wonder what people do with the next one, honestly.
[25:40.39]Also, too, the ground.
[25:42.55]I think you can put pretty much anything on the ground.
[25:44.07]Remember last time it was like you had to have specific things on the floor?
[25:48.31]It had to be a floor panel.
[25:49.61]It had to be a wall panel.
[25:51.73]That limitation is gone.
[25:54.01]I can just do this.
[25:56.09]I can have my entire floor be covered with like a grandma wallpaper.
[26:06.04]Which is crazy.
[26:08.18]All the way, I want to make sure to make this clear too.
[26:10.52]I'll be playing this for the next three straight days after tonight.
[26:17.42]This is an ugly house.
[26:18.78]That's fine.
[26:19.52]Also, let me talk about the grading.
[26:20.72]I went over the rules last night, but we'll go over it again.
[26:23.48]So at the end of this period, when 20 minutes goes by and it's like, okay, pencils down, they're all going to give me their files.
[26:33.51]I am going to screen share to them.
[26:35.95]So I get a clean video.
[26:38.45]So I'll screen share to them and they will guide me through the tour.
[26:44.57]So that's kind of how that'll work.
[26:45.83]I will give one grade for this.
[26:50.35]Because this is the warm-up rounds, this is not really the main event.
[26:54.85]The total... I was going to do 15% for the total grade, but I'm going to make it 10%.
[26:59.68]Just easier that way.
[27:11.67]This is like a fucked up house.
[27:16.19]Will you do the best man speech at my wedding?
[27:18.15]Yeah.
[27:25.67]Uh, excuse me.
[27:27.35]Excuse me, everybody.
[27:29.97]Give me one second, please.
[27:32.03]Uh, my buddy over here.
[27:33.81]Getting married, you know.
[27:37.35]And wowee.
[27:39.67]Didn't think I'd ever see you today, right, everybody?
[27:43.45]Time for laughter.
[27:44.67]Laughter.
[27:45.65]Mom's laughing.
[27:46.27]I just want to say it's an honor to be here as the speech giver.
[27:51.63]And that I wish, obviously, the new couple a wonderful, healthy life together.
[27:58.93]And I also hope that everybody gets out there and starts dancing in a few minutes when we cut the cake.
[28:08.92]Hey.
[28:09.40]Yep.
[28:11.45]You'll be out there, Frank.
[28:12.39]I know you will.
[28:13.61]But anyways, yeah, it's an honor.
[28:14.91]Let's give a toast, please, to the newlyweds.
[28:18.99]And see you later.
[28:24.25]Was that good?
[28:30.77]I wonder in the naughty card.
[28:35.57]People, I don't want to say anything, but that one, like, I don't know.
[28:39.03]That one's going to be stupid.
[28:41.74]That was really awkward, so it was really realistic.
[28:43.68]Oh yeah.
[28:47.28]Why am I so red?
[28:48.08]I think it's the white balance on this camera.
[28:54.10]Dude, I plugged this into like a USB 3.2 port and it made me red.
[29:01.81]Why?
[29:02.09]Alright, we're almost getting to the halfway point.
[29:06.13]How are people doing?
[29:07.15]Don't give me any spoilers, but are people doing alright?
[29:11.14]I feel so bad for Bonnie and Esvan.
[29:13.40]I think they were in the dead mines.
[29:16.24]12 and a half minutes ago.
[29:26.69]Ludwig is suffering.
[29:28.53]Is he?
[29:29.37]What's wrong?
[29:35.81]Is the lighting?
[29:36.61]I think it's the white balance, honestly.
[29:52.26]Put a blue image on one of your screens.
[29:54.26]It'll make you less red.
[29:55.32]I got way too much shit up here.
[30:01.03]Connor needs help.
[30:02.23]I'll go down and help.
[30:06.01]Hey.
[30:07.03]Hello.
[30:07.51]How you doing?
[30:07.89]You doing alright?
[30:09.01]Yeah, you know.
[30:10.96]What can I help you with?
[30:12.90]Uh, do you have, like, do you know Connor Dog VA?
[30:17.79]Yeah.
[30:18.97]Is he asleep?
[30:20.77]Uh, you know, maybe.
[30:23.09]Well, you get both prompts.
[30:28.27]Oh, I was, oh, I get both.
[30:30.72]Oh, no, I thought I was just second prompt.
[30:34.14]Oh, man.
[30:35.28]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[30:36.14]I got better get started then.
[30:37.93]Oh, you're okay.
[30:38.87]So you're waiting.
[30:39.49]Okay.
[30:40.09]Well, no, I'll get going.
[30:41.83]I'll get going.
[30:42.65]Just, you know, just know I just started right now.
[30:44.78]So like great off that.
[30:46.04]I mean, honestly, we, we can just knock off this first build, but you can just chill if you want.
[30:51.44]Deal.
[30:51.82]Deal.
[30:52.52]Lock in.
[30:53.38]Cause, cause then you just do the second one and I'll, I'll change, I'll change the grade appropriately.
[30:58.89]Yep.
[30:59.57]That sounds like a plan that we could work it out.
[31:02.43]Whatever the time.
[31:03.90]Perfect.
[31:04.62]Alright.
[31:04.90]I'll, uh, you know, I'll see what I can do.
[31:06.86]That was weird.
[31:07.97]Yeah.
[31:08.19]But do you need like building help?
[31:10.73]Um, no, if I do, I'll let you know.
[31:12.17]I'll figure it out.
[31:13.47]Yeah.
[31:13.77]You, I would just say you could just kind of chill for this one.
[31:17.91]And the second one, uh, will be, I'll do like a little something.
[31:21.21]Yeah.
[31:21.39]Definitely.
[31:21.69]Probably what I would have done anyways, but yeah.
[31:23.39]Alright.
[31:24.96]Thank you.
[31:25.40]Yeah.
[31:25.54]I wonder, cause I, I, I talked to him yesterday.
[31:28.54]He'll be around.
[31:29.14]He probably just messed up.
[31:30.30]I mean, it's like time zones, too.
[31:31.65]It's just like, oh, it's like plus 12 or something.
[31:35.45]It's just so.
[31:35.81]I've been saying we should just like get rid of time zones.
[31:38.37]Use universal time.
[31:39.55]Yeah, it's 6 a.m.
[31:41.05]Japan.
[31:41.49]Yeah, I would be surprised if he was like awake.
[31:44.73]Maybe he'll join for the last one.
[31:46.67]That'd be cool.
[31:49.65]But yeah, I just want to make sure you're good.
[31:51.69]No, I'm doing great.
[31:52.39]Doing great.
[31:52.77]Thanks.
[31:53.49]It's literally there's only 10 minutes left.
[31:56.63]So how do you remove the roof, by the way?
[31:59.46]You remove the roof by going to roof.
[32:05.30]The build roof tool?
[32:07.88]Okay, so if you go to build roof, you can just click the roof and then just hit delete.
[32:12.69]And then you kind of have to remove the walls that are left over, but it kind of builds extra walls.
[32:18.71]Oh, yeah.
[32:19.31]I don't even know if you can paint the roof.
[32:20.89]We're trying to figure it out, but I'm not sure.
[32:22.09]Okay, I'll figure it out.
[32:23.95]Thanks.
[32:24.87]Yep.
[32:28.35]okay so he's good yeah I got let me see do I have any dms or anything I do not let me see you need anything else oh I didn't know I was still here I'm like hmm let me see what can I do
[32:51.73]The timer?
[32:52.35]The timer, I think, I don't know why the timer keeps doing that.
[32:55.24]It's still counting, it's just, for some reason, just... When I, uh, alt-tab.
[33:11.91]Do you need anything else?
[33:13.87]So, do you need anything else, or... That was funny.
[33:17.39]You're so red.
[33:18.37]Why?! !
[33:20.26]I don't even care.
[33:21.00]Good, I'll be red today.
[33:21.98]Who gives a shit?
[33:23.26]That means I'm full of fucking blood.
[33:25.18]I'm full of energy.
[33:34.54]You're wearing a puffy vampire shirt.
[33:45.99]You should go help Esvan.
[33:46.91]Alright, I will.
[33:48.80]Yeah, my job right now, especially like in this stage, is because I'm going to build a house on the third phase.
[33:55.32]I'm going to do one.
[33:57.11]But let me go.
[33:57.89]Whoever needs help or needs clarification, like I'll go help.
[34:02.03]And there's an Italian restaurant.
[34:03.93]You need help?
[34:04.81]It's all Rocky Balboa.
[34:06.07]Heard you guys might need some help.
[34:07.19]You guys alright?
[34:07.67]Oh, hi.
[34:08.13]I think we figured it out.
[34:09.81]We just figured out how to do stuff because we haven't played this before, but... Well, chat, obviously it was chat's fault because... It was chat's fault.
[34:18.00]It's always chat's fault.
[34:19.60]They wouldn't tell us how to be able to lay down the tile, but I think we figured it out.
[34:23.74]Yeah, I put a bunch of tile outside and then yeah, we had trouble unpacking it, but I figured we didn't have to do that.
[34:29.97]Alright.
[34:30.19]So here's what I ask you to do right now.
[34:31.99]Save that game.
[34:33.17]Save it right now.
[34:34.51]Okay.
[34:35.15]When you save it, go back.
[34:37.65]When you go back into it, click edit property, not play.
[34:41.97]So you guys are.
[34:43.39]Oh, you guys are.
[34:43.83]You guys are in sandbox mode.
[34:44.81]Yeah, we did that.
[34:45.39]Yeah.
[34:45.79]Oh, wait.
[34:46.62]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:47.64]I think so.
[34:48.08]Does it look wrong?
[34:48.97]Are you sure?
[34:49.45]Can you guys fly?
[34:50.27]If you double tap space, can you fly?
[34:53.03]Yes.
[34:53.69]I can fly.
[34:54.71]So you guys are in it.
[34:55.52]Okay.
[34:55.96]So when you do right click...
[34:58.00]How do I unfly?
[34:58.86]Double tap space.
[35:00.24]When you right click, that's like your construction mode.
[35:04.49]So you've got the walls.
[35:07.07]So I got to all this.
[35:08.49]The thing I was having trouble with was actually the difference between I was using the store and I got tiles out of the store and I couldn't figure out how to place them.
[35:15.26]But I guess in the edit mode,
[35:16.98]with the right click is how we actually do everything yeah so we use the bottom left buttons like exactly to be able to okay yeah so when you go to surface finishes that's ceiling that's walls that's floor and when you do q your material when you click on you go to q and go to material that top the top tabs are the all the way to the left is paint you've got like cinder blocks and and stucco and and wallpaper and you can put these anywhere you can put them literally anywhere
[35:44.18]When you do that, it's just clicking and dragging and putting whatever you want.
[35:47.70]You can change the color.
[35:49.27]Everything is done through that.
[35:50.19]Same thing with the walls, too.
[35:52.03]Okay.
[35:52.77]Sick.
[35:53.89]Thanks a ton, dude.
[35:56.07]I wanted to make sure you guys knew what was going on.
[35:57.73]This is a warm-up, too.
[35:59.55]You guys will be ready for the last one, too.
[36:01.51]And the next one.
[36:02.17]Don't worry.
[36:03.00]It's all fun.
[36:03.40]See you in a little bit.
[36:05.76]Thank you.
[36:10.62]Look at me.
[36:12.52]Look at me helping.
[36:16.99]Well, my house sucks.
[36:21.43]One of the Marge Simpson impressions.
[36:25.66]I removed that.
[36:29.24]I guess I want to be able to talk to these people again after today.
[36:41.74]Why are you in a costume?
[36:42.92]This is I'm a I'm a real estate person.
[36:48.81]I was going to wear a tie, but I didn't want to.
[36:50.29]I was like, no, that's not happening.
[36:54.23]Who are the current builders right now?
[36:56.83]The current builders right now, I believe, are... I guess whoever decided.
[37:02.23]I'm not entirely sure.
[37:04.25]I know, like, three of them.
[37:05.33]Because I think they were still trying to figure it out when they went into the calls privately, but... All that matters is that I get their zip file.
[37:18.48]Yeah, let me show you this, too.
[37:19.40]This is cool.
[37:21.31]So, in this game... Take a look at this.
[37:25.91]I can go all the way to like the sky.
[37:32.95]Got a five minute warning in case I forget.
[37:37.92]You can make huge stuff.
[37:41.96]You can also do this also editing too.
[37:43.42]You can do you can go to objects.
[37:45.72]This is the tab that a lot of people are used to, but like all the bathroom fixtures in.
[37:50.78]Can you make the toilet huge?
[37:52.02]I wonder.
[37:56.95]You cannot.
[37:57.63]But you can interact with the toilet now.
[38:00.01]Couldn't before.
[38:03.53]Can you flush it?
[38:05.27]I don't believe you can.
[38:06.09]This is all stuff we'll figure out when we play the actual game.
[38:11.85]There you can do bathtubs.
[38:13.31]You can rotate.
[38:14.13]You can put them wherever you want.
[38:17.85]I did hear what Esfand said that they were making.
[38:23.49]The two of them.
[38:26.46]I'm so excited.
[38:30.96]Play some festive background music.
[38:32.34]Oh, there should be some music right now.
[38:35.04]I turned it way down.
[38:36.34]Hold on.
[38:40.47]Hey, look at that.
[38:41.91]That's nice.
[38:48.15]This is not festive.
[38:48.97]This is nice.
[38:52.15]Is Dug Dug still playing Phil Collins?

[39:18.93]Also, too, check this out.
[39:21.13]I don't know how much people are familiar with the game, because we got the game early, like by about a few days, because obviously with the launches today, how would anybody know what to do?
[39:33.72]But in the small amount of time that we've been able to kind of try to do stuff in the game, it's not just, oh, I can build stairs and go to the second floor.
[39:46.93]Look at this.
[39:52.08]You can go under.
[39:56.72]So there's a lot of material.
[40:02.60]Not sure if anybody knows you can do that, but.
[40:06.84]Maybe they'll know now.
[40:14.09]Put the camera higher.
[40:14.99]I think it's fine.
[40:19.35]Alright, we have two minutes remaining.
[40:22.49]Two minutes remaining, and then we're going to go for it.
[40:26.70]So, Connor is no longer presenting first.
[40:30.84]Actually, no, why not?
[40:31.84]Let's let him.
[40:34.58]Because I have the presentations here.
[40:40.52]Presentation one is going to be CDawg and Connor, but CDawg is not here, so Connor is just going to do whatever he has.
[40:47.41]And then we'll do Doug.
[40:48.97]Whether it's Doug, Doug, or Ludwig.
[40:53.24]There are your teams and that's the order they're going to present.
[40:59.95]Do you have shoes on?
[41:04.58]If you do, buckle them.
[41:05.48]Time that person off for four days.
[41:09.42]And then let them write a paragraph explaining how sorry they are.
[41:12.41]And then let them back.
[41:22.74]Alright, we're at almost one minute.
[41:25.88]I'm so excited.
[41:27.92]God, I had the easiest job.
[41:29.04]I just have to sit here and like look like an idiot.

[41:58.06]Well, I want to be around to jump around in these calls if need be.
[42:03.14]In the third build, the third build is 90 minutes.
[42:06.43]So I'm going to make a house in the third build.
[42:10.11]But I got to be available.
[42:17.25]Something else cool.
[42:17.73]Watch this.
[42:19.15]There's a trash generator.
[42:20.51]Don't tell anybody.
[42:22.11]They need to find this.
[42:25.42]The amount of trash.
[42:27.60]Like 20.
[42:29.70]Three seconds.
[42:32.20]That's it.

[43:10.50]I am Prairie.
[43:11.18]Okay.
[43:12.30]So, CDawg isn't here.
[43:15.40]So, the first person that's going to present is Connor.
[43:17.84]So, Connor, do you want to do... We really tried our best.
[43:20.11]Do you want to show us something, Connor?
[43:21.61]Yeah, I can, once I figure out how to get this out of here.
[43:24.29]Alright.
[43:24.71]So, let me tell everybody.
[43:25.39]Let me refresh everybody.
[43:26.69]So, when you're in, don't leave your game right now.
[43:28.89]While you're in your game, please press tab.
[43:33.61]Go to property settings at the top.
[43:37.25]In the lower right is going to be export as mod.
[43:39.81]It's going to open a file explorer on your screen.
[43:42.07]Yep.
[43:42.81]It just made that zip file that it just literally like HF2, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[43:47.26]That is your house.
[43:47.90]That's the house right there.
[43:48.74]Oh, okay.
[43:49.52]So you're going to take that zip file and bring it over to the basement uploads in the Discord.
[43:55.28]All of you that just completed, all of you, there should be nine uploads.
[43:59.43]Okay.
[43:59.81]In that basement uploads.
[44:00.85]And if you rename them to your username, so it's just easier for you to know.
[44:04.97]Okay.
[44:05.15]Alright.
[44:07.93]Prop is dinner.
[44:09.91]Sorry, can you repeat that?
[44:11.74]Yep.
[44:12.94]While you're in sandbox mode, hit tab.
[44:17.50]Go to property settings at the top left.
[44:20.27]On the bottom, name the property like you poke.
[44:25.07]Uh, property type house.
[44:26.27]Don't touch any of this other stuff.
[44:27.25]It's fine because I'm going to be doing it in sandbox mode.
[44:29.83]And then export as mod in the bottom right.
[44:33.22]That is going to just make the file.
[44:35.02]It's not like, oh, save and save as.
[44:36.98]When you click export as mod, it is just making the file.
[44:40.30]I didn't set it as my name.
[44:41.48]I'm so sorry.
[44:42.18]It's alright.
[44:42.54]It don't matter.
[44:43.18]As long as it's there.
[44:43.86]And as long as it's like, I can see who, I can see that you uploaded.
[44:46.23]So it's fine.
[44:46.79]Okay.
[44:47.59]Alright.
[44:48.19]So while you're doing that, just, uh, I'm going to be a Connor.
[44:50.87]Okay.
[44:52.44]I'm going to... You and I are going to go in and call.
[44:56.18]Actually, you guys can watch too if you really want to, I guess.
[44:58.43]Yeah.
[44:59.71]I'll watch the houses, but are there... Is everyone watching?
[45:02.49]Is everyone building?
[45:03.09]How's it work?
[45:03.87]I'm going to just message me.
[45:05.25]Alright, so here's how we're going to do this.
[45:08.19]To save some time, everybody that did not build, all the player twos, raise your hand.
[45:14.94]Hi.
[45:15.78]Okay.
[45:16.48]All player twos are going to go right now
[45:21.04]Oh, no.
[45:21.66]And they're going to start their naughty build.
[45:24.53]Oh.
[45:25.09]What?
[45:26.13]Oh, right now.
[45:27.17]Wait a minute.
[45:28.07]So here's the thing.
[45:29.89]Here's the thing.
[45:30.79]Hold on.
[45:31.25]Hold your questions.
[45:32.25]Hold your questions.
[45:33.53]Guys, hold your questions.
[45:34.45]Whoever is building right now, you are only going to be away from your partner for three or four minutes.
[45:40.41]Because if you want to go hang out with your partner and help them build, you can go do that.
[45:47.49]If you want to watch the tours, absolutely.
[45:49.55]But you're only technically going to be away from your partner for as long as you really want to right now.
[45:53.96]So are we just going to get dragged back in while doing our presentation?
[45:58.46]So when I'm done with all the first tours, that's when we'll start doing the second tours.
[46:08.54]Alright.
[46:10.08]Okay.
[46:11.02]And so our theme is also food and naughty.
[46:16.21]No, this is a new build.
[46:18.05]So player two, your build that is going to start when I start the timer.
[46:24.95]It's a naughty build.
[46:25.75]Your timer's fast.
[46:27.85]It's 20 minutes.
[46:29.16]Your timer is running a little bit fast.
[46:31.67]Is it the Google timer?
[46:32.59]I believe that's it.
[46:33.83]I had a timer that I started when you said going.
[46:35.93]I think yours is running a little fast.
[46:37.99]What is your timer at?
[46:39.99]Yours was at least 30 seconds fast.
[46:42.73]Oh.
[46:43.91]We're talking 30 seconds?
[46:45.08]Time zones.
[46:46.48]Okay.
[46:46.80]Yeah, I feel like that's 2.5% more time you could have.
[46:50.88]That is a lot.
[46:51.92]Do you want two per five?
[46:52.84]Can we add 30 seconds to the top?
[46:54.20]We'll add 30 seconds to the next one.
[46:58.74]okay okay nice ladies and gentlemen player b your build which you have 20 minutes just like the just like the first one is technological advancements
[47:12.45]Oh dear.
[47:13.61]Technological advancements.
[47:15.47]Oh my god.
[47:16.27]Wait, Build A was dinner and I have technological advancements?
[47:19.95]Wait, there's a bit of a step up?
[47:21.75]There's a whole food category!
[47:23.89]Don't worry.
[47:25.22]Don't worry.
[47:26.08]The fuck?
[47:26.90]Room 1, room 1.
[47:27.58]I can do this.
[47:29.24]Hey, interpret that however you want.
[47:31.76]Technological advancements.
[47:33.84]Technology.
[47:35.40]Does it start when we go now?
[47:36.80]Hold on here.
[47:37.30]We can go?
[47:38.16]Don't go yet.
[47:38.68]The team guy beside you is not gonna cooperate with you now.
[47:42.12]I'm starting now.
[47:42.94]They will.
[47:43.66]They will.
[47:45.32]But if you're giving me a tour, make sure you're up here to give me the tour.
[47:49.81]See, now where you're still talking, is the timer going?
[47:52.17]No, no, no.
[47:52.73]I haven't started.
[47:53.47]I didn't say 3, 2, 1.
[47:54.57]Jerma, will you do me a favor and just come in and tap my shoulder when it's time for me to give a tour?
[47:58.23]So if I start now, is it cheating?
[48:00.29]Open my stream.
[48:00.79]Open my stream.
[48:03.37]On my screen right now is the order that you guys are going to go in.
[48:07.39]Okay, we're near the end.
[48:08.87]So don't start now.
[48:09.99]If you are in the last five teams, you have at least 20 minutes, like 15 minutes right now to go hang out.
[48:19.65]You look good right now.
[48:20.75]I want you to know that you look fucking good right now.
[48:22.77]Thanks, dude.
[48:24.11]You're sucking up.
[48:24.85]You're clearly sucking up.
[48:25.89]I'm not sucking up.
[48:26.72]I see a man and I think he looks good.
[48:28.22]I say it out loud.
[48:28.88]I'm not controversial like you.
[48:30.10]Any other questions before we start the second build?
[48:31.68]We're starting with Connor.
[48:33.58]Let's make it easy.
[48:35.61]Uh, who is DougDoug Ludwig?
[48:37.31]Who's player A?
[48:38.89]Uh, player A was me.
[48:39.64]I'm gonna stay here.
[48:40.24]Okay, so you'll be here.
[48:40.86]So whoever is player... Just go through that list and be like, okay, so where are you on the list is when you know you need to be back up there.
[48:46.70]We'll make sure the mods will go.
[48:47.68]We'll be on this too.
[48:48.86]That makes total sense to me.
[48:49.84]Alright, here we go.
[48:50.92]Ready?
[48:51.62]So Connor, I'm gonna go take your file, but the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna press the start.
[48:57.29]And everybody, in three, two, one.
[48:59.21]Technological advancements, player B, good luck.
[49:01.57]Make sure you use that same template.
[49:03.09]Are you using the same template?
[49:04.15]You should be.
[49:05.37]I'll be there in a second, Doug.
[49:06.29]Good luck.
[49:06.98]You have to use the same template.
[49:10.00]The same template.
[49:12.30]Don't use the same house that your partner just built.
[49:14.30]The same template that you got earlier.
[49:17.73]Alright, let's go.
[49:19.17]So, Connor, how you doing?
[49:21.61]I'm doing good.
[49:22.63]The timer's going to pause for one second.
[49:25.56]Maybe not.
[49:25.82]Alright.
[49:27.60]So, team one.
[49:29.26]Here's yours.
[49:30.70]Okay.
[49:31.14]Very, very, very cool.
[49:33.40]Connor, call me, by the way.
[49:34.28]He woke up.
[49:34.84]He was in bed.
[49:35.99]Oh, was he really?
[49:36.73]Oh, my God.
[49:37.49]Yeah, he's coming now.
[49:38.71]Can you stream it on Discord?
[49:42.61]Yeah, I'm going to stream this on Discord, yeah.
[49:44.53]Okay.
[49:46.49]Let me just get in there first.
[49:48.95]Okay, I got your zip.
[49:53.48]Discord is like, dude, this might be a virus.
[49:59.21]I put a virus on the map.
[50:04.53]Okay.
[50:08.49]So, let me screen share.
[50:09.83]Like this.
[50:18.76]Alright, I have your... I have it.
[50:24.10]Let's see.
[50:26.30]Maybe I don't.
[50:30.90]Hmm.
[50:31.72]Could you... Because that doesn't work.
[50:35.25]Did I do it incorrectly?
[50:36.61]So when you... Just export it normally.
[50:38.95]Don't change the name, maybe.
[50:40.05]Because I wonder if that's why it's not showing up.
[50:48.78]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[50:49.44]Hold on.
[50:53.06]No, no.
[50:53.48]This is the one I already had.
[50:55.44]I just posted another one.
[50:56.68]Oh, let me make sure.
[50:57.52]I didn't change the name.
[50:58.48]Yeah.
[51:07.57]Yeah, we tested this a few times.
[51:08.55]It should work.
[51:14.87]There we go.
[51:15.59]Alright.
[51:15.93]So maybe you can't rename it.
[51:17.85]Alright, Connor.
[51:18.31]Alright.
[51:20.05]I am about to be ready and I'll make sure that you can see everything.
[51:23.32]Oh my fucking God.
[51:25.40]Oh, it's spoiled.
[51:26.12]It's spoiled.
[51:26.86]Okay.
[51:30.68]Let me screen share this first.
[51:33.91]I'm sorry, I just woke up.
[51:35.89]Hey, what's up, dude?
[51:38.35]Hey, you gotta get to work on House B, by the way.
[51:41.65]I'll carry so hard, House B. You don't even know.
[51:43.73]We're going for a completely different religion for the next house.
[51:47.33]Okay, good.
[51:47.97]Alright, so.
[51:51.11]I am gonna go outside of your house.
[51:52.55]Is my camera fucked up?
[51:54.32]What the fuck?
[51:57.12]What the fuck is this shit?
[51:59.40]Why?
[51:59.72]What's wrong?
[52:04.10]There.
[52:04.78]This camera is a piece of crap.
[52:06.36]Alright, let's go.
[52:06.78]Alright.
[52:07.62]Can you see?
[52:08.78]Yep.
[52:09.42]Alright.
[52:09.68]So remember, the theme was dinner and you're going to get a grade from me.
[52:12.32]You're also going to get a grade from chat.
[52:14.18]So I would like you can see I would like you to guide me through your your first bill.
[52:19.49]Yeah, so, I mean, you can kind of take your own tour around, but this is sort of the front of the creation.
[52:24.67]That was an experiment, trying to figure out how to change the walls.
[52:27.75]Right.
[52:29.24]So, you know, put those there.
[52:30.66]Again, it's a work in progress.
[52:31.88]Okay.
[52:32.84]You can actually put this on C-Dog's score.
[52:34.72]This was his house.
[52:36.00]This was his player A. C-Dog's score.
[52:37.94]He was player A.
[52:40.44]So, yeah, if you walk in, we have a photo of the last supper.
[52:44.93]It was dinner, and supper is synonymous with dinner.
[52:49.09]Oh, my God.
[52:49.89]The lighting was a bit bad, so we put in some of those because ceiling lights, we're still working on how to do that, figure that out.
[52:58.49]This is, I will tell you,
[53:01.41]This is awesome.
[53:02.64]It's a beautiful piece, isn't it?
[53:03.98]This is actually, like, you thought outside the box a little.
[53:08.24]This was not just, you know, like, what I was thinking, like, how are people going to interpret this?
[53:12.26]Are you going to build a table?
[53:13.50]Are you going to put a bunch of food everywhere?
[53:15.43]Is it going to be a restaurant?
[53:16.61]Is it going to be, like, a kitchen, right?
[53:18.41]Could be anything.
[53:19.97]You did the last supper and you lit the wall.
[53:25.27]Yeah.
[53:25.91]Also, keep in mind, you did not know you were even building.
[53:30.41]Right.
[53:30.73]That's huge.
[53:31.21]No, I didn't.
[53:31.95]Yeah.
[53:32.21]I was kind of just figuring out what I'm doing.
[53:34.75]No, it's, I played around with the whole, I mean, you can check around the house too, but yeah, let me, is there anything else you'd like me to see?
[53:42.56]I mean, you can look around.
[53:43.68]It's up to you.
[53:45.04]It's a free form kind of environment on top of it.
[53:47.28]There's like a little, we have like the cost.
[53:51.61]It's like a church.
[53:52.33]Right.
[53:52.81]It's supposed to be like a bit of a mega church.
[53:54.93]Okay.
[53:55.33]I feel you.
[53:55.85]I see.
[53:56.25]I see.
[53:56.59]Yeah.
[53:59.14]Alright, I have a grade for you.
[54:02.61]You can keep exploring.
[54:03.51]I mean, maybe there's... Oh, there's more.
[54:05.45]Is there any guidance I should have?
[54:08.27]You can look behind.
[54:08.91]There's no guide.
[54:09.93]There's no guide.
[54:10.59]Let me go over here.
[54:11.50]It's up to you.
[54:18.44]Why is there a plane?
[54:20.30]Oh, it's the jet.
[54:21.30]That's right.
[54:22.22]It's okay.
[54:23.28]That's right.
[54:23.84]That's, um, Kenneth.

[54:38.82]Thank you.

[54:49.63]Thank you so much.
[54:50.95]I'm going to give you a B-.
[54:51.65]Thank you so much.
[54:53.57]Wow.
[54:53.65]And that exact score... I'll give you 72.
[55:04.10]No, no, no, 82, 82.
[55:05.74]Sorry, 82.
[55:07.24]82?
[55:07.26]82 is even better.
[55:08.58]Holy shit.
[55:09.28]So Connor, Connor Eads Pants, your grade for this, for me, is a B minus.
[55:15.86]So if we can get chat... I scored higher than my 100 Thieves Orphanage.
[55:22.73]Uh, chat, you are going to get four choices.
[55:24.69]65, 75, 85, or 95.
[55:26.01]There's no such thing as 100.
[55:33.63]what is Connor's grid hello hey hey ludwig what's going on it actually went pretty well conor reed's pants just got a b minus that's good well I didn't see what he did but I think you will love what I did okay
[55:57.57]I'm interested.
[55:58.51]So one thing that's important, I don't think you can rename the files because I just tried to open his and it was all kind of messed up.
[56:04.71]So if you could, could you re-export it as just whatever the default is that it says?
[56:09.55]I couldn't imagine that being an issue.
[56:12.29]Okay, sweet.
[56:15.23]Property settings.
[56:16.17]So chat has given Connor a 75.
[56:16.75]Let's see.
[56:17.17]Connor, that's an 80.
[56:17.77]Your average is an 80 right now.
[56:26.07]Wow.
[56:26.75]I think Connor's probably like making breakfast right now, but if he can hear us, I'm sure he's proud.
[56:31.14]Enjoy your natto.
[56:33.72]Enjoy your natto in coffee.
[56:36.66]I am 75%.
[56:37.46]I am 75% of the grade.
[56:38.50]Chat, you were 25% of the grade.
[56:40.02]That's why people are asking why.
[56:42.04]Controversial to say, I feel like I'm fucking up.
[56:45.05]Why?
[56:45.57]Because mine is 11 kilobytes and everyone else's is hundreds of kilobytes.
[56:51.91]We'll find out.
[56:52.65]I'm going to open it.
[56:54.03]You should have built more.
[56:59.40]Okay, I have yours, Lud.
[57:02.11]Does it look like a white mausoleum?
[57:04.78]Let's find out what it looks like.
[57:05.90]Oh, God.
[57:11.53]Yeah, I didn't add any images.
[57:12.85]Yeah, because here's my concern.
[57:14.25]Last time we did this, it felt like it was who has the funniest memes on their computer.
[57:19.31]And I wanted to make art, right?
[57:22.19]So if you could step outside for a moment, Jeremiah.
[57:23.97]Yeah, yeah.
[57:24.39]I haven't looked at anything.
[57:25.79]I have to reset my camera because every time... What is going on with this fucking camera?
[57:30.91]I do like when it freezes.
[57:34.12]It's so weird.
[57:35.72]Why is it so weird?
[57:36.64]Alright, I'm coming back.
[57:39.68]Here I am.
[57:40.02]Alright.
[57:41.98]so as I was saying Jerma uh countrymen I wanted to build something not download something okay so I want you to walk in and just tell me your first thought when you look at that it was probably something you haven't seen in a while okay but what do you see here lud did you make the last supper
[58:05.41]That's correct, Jerma.
[58:06.57]I had the innovative idea of making the Last Supper something I didn't think a lot of other people here would latch on to.
[58:12.27]No, of course not.
[58:15.55]Sorry, what?
[58:19.50]Connor eats pants.
[58:21.36]Did the Last Supper as well?
[58:23.90]What a coincidence.
[58:26.63]Did you cheat off me?
[58:28.73]No, I definitely did.
[58:30.17]I absolutely did not.
[58:31.33]Someone in chat was like, do The Last Supper.
[58:32.91]And I was like, oh, okay.
[58:34.35]Okay, well... I mean, honestly, I like yours better because you made The Last Supper and I downloaded a JPEG and put Kenneth Copeland on the back of the wall.
[58:42.30]I did make it.
[58:43.18]So it's a one-to-one replica.
[58:44.42]They used purple marble in the back walls with accented squares and then tan marble with a terracotta floor.
[58:50.78]This was where The Last Supper was held.
[58:52.56]This was in what is...
[58:54.92]now modern uh day uh Jerusalem and uh as you can see I made it a gamer dinner with 13 gamer chairs yep gamer chairs except for Jesus because he's modest he wouldn't game in a gaming chair he would merely game in a wood chair I feel it I feel it okay I do love do you here's a question do you have the right amount of chairs of the people that were at the last supper
[59:19.82]Yeah, so I have one for Jesus in the 12 apostles, including Judas, that bitch.
[59:26.42]Excuse my language.
[59:28.99]And all the authentic food that they ate there.
[59:31.43]Okay, so let's go over some of the food real quick.
[59:33.91]So they got a cheeseburger, cheesecake, banana.
[59:38.43]That's a sandwich, Jerma.
[59:40.59]That's a sandwich.
[59:43.10]Cheese.
[59:43.88]They definitely had cheese and grapes.
[59:45.40]They had cheese.
[59:46.12]Yeah.
[59:47.30]Okay.
[59:47.66]They had a...
[59:49.52]see booze.
[59:52.30]They didn't have wine in the thing.
[59:54.64]So you know, whiskey was close.
[59:58.44]And I love all the alcohol is placed in front of where Jesus would be sitting, where you think they're making it.
[60:04.76]He's cheffing it up.
[60:07.40]I love it.
[60:08.02]I think this is great.
[60:10.88]I am going to give you on this.
[60:13.95]I like the outside.
[60:14.79]Anything else that I should go look at?
[60:16.15]Or are we
[60:18.50]Honestly, it's more about looking within.
[60:20.30]Yeah.
[60:22.12]I love it.
[60:24.46]I love how the first two have been Christian-themed.
[60:28.10]I'm curious if there's seven out of nine of these will be Christian-themed.
[60:31.66]I don't think so.
[60:32.68]I think you guys are wrong.
[60:34.06]Hey, Merry Christmas.
[60:35.59]That's what I'm saying.
[60:36.13]Bring it back.
[60:36.93]Okay.
[60:37.67]Ludwig, this is great.
[60:39.59]I'm going to say the only critique that I have...
[60:43.13]is, uh, I would like for the, I would like the food to maybe be placed a little nicer.
[60:49.35]It's a little, it's a little haphazard.
[60:51.63]Uh, there's no, there's only one sandwich on a plate.
[60:55.19]I think Jesus would probably have a little bit of something to say about that.
[60:57.25]Uh, it's almost like they're eating, like it's their last meal, you know?
[61:01.29]True.
[61:01.49]Okay.
[61:03.62]Uh, Ludd, I'm going to give you, that is a, that is a salt.
[61:08.84]Hmm.
[61:09.32]That's it.
[61:09.66]I'm fighting between A minus and B plus.
[61:13.12]Trust yourself.
[61:14.34]And if it hurts me, it helps you.
[61:19.32]I'm going to be B+.
[61:21.50]I think B+.
[61:21.90]Are you sure?
[61:22.66]Are you sure?
[61:23.02]Switch it.
[61:23.34]Switch it.
[61:23.58]I'm going to cry.
[61:26.52]Ludwig, congratulations.
[61:27.56]It's a B+.
[61:28.12]It's a great grade.
[61:28.78]Chat, what are you going to give Lud's first build?
[61:31.26]I'm going to call him a Judas.
[61:36.35]You Judas.
[61:39.21]You're not a Judas.
[61:40.07]You're like a John.
[61:45.69]Alright.
[61:46.01]So grades, what do we got?
[61:48.41]Yeah.
[61:48.71]Ludd just got a, uh, B minus the exact, no, not B, my B plus the exact score.
[61:54.05]I'm going to give you an 89, 89.
[61:59.34]Thank you so much, chef.
[62:00.00]Thank you very much, chef.
[62:00.70]I appreciate it.
[62:01.28]Uh, and, and I will only get better from here.
[62:03.94]Thank you, chef.
[62:04.42]I'll leave you alone.
[62:06.00]Yeah.
[62:06.84]Excellent work.
[62:07.66]Excellent.
[62:08.02]Excellent work.
[62:10.50]Okay.
[62:11.02]So, uh, what did Jack give?
[62:15.58]A bee!
[62:16.06]Alright, so that's a... Alright, Lud, that's a good start for you and DugDug.
[62:19.20]It's a good start for both of you.
[62:21.79]Now go help... Go help him.
[62:24.71]Oh, hey, Connor, we need to go to our own room.
[62:27.31]Yes, so Connor.
[62:28.51]Oh.
[62:28.91]So C-Dawg.
[62:29.85]Hey, gang.
[62:30.71]I would... C-Dawg, I would like to tell you what you need to go build right now.
[62:36.24]Please do.
[62:36.80]Okay.
[62:37.12]So CDawg, you have, uh, you got like seven minutes, but it's okay.
[62:40.78]We'll, we'll put you at, we'll, we'll, we'll fill you in later.
[62:44.24]So you are going to build, uh, would you have that file?
[62:49.41]You have that zip file?
[62:50.78]Alright, the mods will help you.
[62:52.84]It's a zip file.
[62:54.66]You're going to import that.
[62:57.20]They'll help you.
[62:57.86]They'll tell you how to do it.
[62:59.22]And when you do that, you are going to build the famous technological advancements.
[63:04.66]That is your prompt.
[63:06.20]However you want to play that, go for it.
[63:08.60]You got 20 minutes.
[63:09.36]Alright, let's go to room 8.
[63:11.47]Alright, who's next?
[63:13.55]Is it my turn?
[63:14.49]It is.
[63:15.05]Hey, RT, how are you?
[63:19.09]Hello, Jeremy.
[63:20.21]I'm doing good.
[63:21.01]How are you keeping?
[63:22.00]I hope you're excited for some homes.
[63:24.50]I'm so excited this game's finally out.
[63:27.06]I've been waiting for this for months.
[63:28.58]It's just so cool to finally see.
[63:30.28]Yeah, I'm excited.
[63:32.64]Have you got the house loaded up on your end?
[63:34.58]I am about to grab it.
[63:35.82]So can you redo it?
[63:36.72]Because I don't think you can.
[63:38.54]You can't custom name files.
[63:41.29]They won't work.
[63:42.85]Do you want me to tell you what the name for the file would have been?
[63:46.25]Or do you want me just to send it again?
[63:47.85]Yeah, just send it again because when somebody renamed, when Connor renamed his file and it didn't come through for us.
[63:55.58]Give me just one second.
[63:57.54]Hang on.
[63:57.80]Let me see if I can, let me try to do it.
[63:59.22]Let me just open it.
[63:59.90]No, no, it's all good.
[64:01.56]I got you.
[64:01.96]I got you.
[64:02.80]Hang on.
[64:03.34]I got it here.
[64:04.64]So I believe it should be this one.
[64:06.91]Oh, hold on.
[64:07.43]Recent file.
[64:08.01]I think this should be it.
[64:09.55]I think it's because the default name is just based on what the map was set to, basically.
[64:14.53]So they're all named the same right now, but that's okay.
[64:16.93]That's okay.
[64:17.39]We can work around it.
[64:18.35]Let me open this and see if this is the right one.
[64:20.93]Okay.
[64:21.39]I'm hoping it is.
[64:22.22]Just let me know if that's okay.
[64:28.24]I think it's good.
[64:31.76]Can you see the screen?
[64:34.10]Sorry?
[64:34.58]Can you see the screen?
[64:36.17]Oh, you want me to look at your screen this time, is it?
[64:38.53]Well, just to help with it.
[64:40.74]Oh, boy.
[64:41.12]I know this is going to be good.
[64:42.04]Oh, okay.
[64:42.70]Alright.
[64:43.04]So I got to present this.
[64:44.16]So I'll kind of follow your screen just so I can show it on my end, too.
[64:48.59]But I hope you are ready for a lovely Christmas Australian dinner.
[64:54.51]There was a lot of theme that we wanted to unveil on this.
[64:57.34]And with the beach and the island set up, we were thinking, okay, what if we made this a gingerbread house set in Australia?
[65:04.54]So we've done gingerbread.
[65:05.60]We have like the icing on the ceiling and the roof.
[65:08.11]We got a little Christmas tree out the front of the garden as well.
[65:11.49]No decorations in that because we don't want to cause any fire hazards in that because Australian Christmas, it's obviously the height of summer.
[65:16.83]It's very, very toasty out.
[65:18.99]Okay.
[65:19.31]So we want to be careful with that.
[65:21.07]If you'd like to step on inside.
[65:22.91]I will step on inside.
[65:24.23]Step on over the frost and the lamps.
[65:26.35]We have a lovely Christmas dinner prepared with candied apples ready on the plate for you to enjoy.
[65:33.18]We've got a bit of leftover bread and some of the leftover veggies from before that, you know, in typical Christmas dinner fashion, no one wants to eat the veg.
[65:39.51]People are about the meat and the sweet stuff.
[65:42.35]We've got pictures, lovely pictures of Santa all over the walls as well, spreading the Christmas cheer.
[65:48.04]The theme was nice, so we wanted to evoke
[65:50.46]That essence of Santa.
[65:51.70]If you actually look at the walls, if you see that we've got the accent wall, but then we've actually got these candy cane flares all about the corners, because we really want to try and evoke some of that Christmas feel, and it's specifically the gingerbread aesthetic.
[66:05.78]So we've got those bits of candy cane.
[66:07.58]We've also got a candy cane rug in the center of the floor.
[66:10.82]Oh my god.
[66:11.88]So we really want to kind of get that nice contrast and kind of like this gingerbread flooring once again with the candy cane.
[66:17.22]This is a toy?
[66:18.86]Yes, because it's Christmas dinner and the idea is there's kids at the meal and these are their toys that they were playing with.
[66:24.71]Wow.
[66:24.99]And they're so excited that they left them out on the floor.
[66:27.53]So we've got a little robot.
[66:28.81]We built like a little model train on the railway.
[66:33.13]Can I ask a question?
[66:34.71]Can I ask a question?
[66:35.85]What question would you like to ask?
[66:38.09]Are these Santa pictures AI generated?
[66:41.97]No, they're not.
[66:43.05]No, they're not.
[66:44.63]It's just pictures to itself.
[66:46.17]They look like they're AI generated.
[66:51.55]Sometimes it's a bit much for the kids, especially at an early age, to see Santa Father Christmas himself at the shopping mall.
[66:59.10]It's a pretty big deal.
[67:00.60]And oh my God, he's in your local area.
[67:03.30]So that's why some of them are a bit panicked.
[67:05.44]But they'll look back at this in later years and really acknowledge that they were having the time of their life.
[67:10.85]Uh, this is, this is great.
[67:14.47]As, uh, as Tony the tiger would want to say, what is this?
[67:17.65]Oh, so no, this is actually a little touch.
[67:19.71]So one of my viewers actually just got a medicine degree and they are from Australia.
[67:24.75]There was actually a shout out in my chat for them.
[67:27.26]So we actually slapped a degree just on the wall because we were already going with the theme of an Australian Christmas.
[67:32.76]So shout out the mood there.
[67:33.96]I hope you're doing fantastic.
[67:35.68]Congratulations.
[67:36.54]Once again, we just slapped a degree and just for himself.
[67:40.05]RT, I have to say something, and I'm telling you, you were the winner last time, and you showed up today for sure, at least in this first build.
[67:52.11]Anything else you'd like to say?
[67:53.91]I didn't do it alone.
[67:54.93]Kiwo has been helping me so much on this part.
[67:57.53]I'm very much looking forward to what Kiwo makes.
[68:01.46]Ah, no, she is working away.
[68:03.14]You're going to be excited to see it.
[68:05.68]I'm giving you literally a solid A. You're getting a 96 on this, by the way.
[68:11.21]Oh, my God.
[68:11.85]That's very kind.
[68:13.13]Jesus Christ.
[68:13.91]This is great.
[68:14.95]Look at all the detail.
[68:15.87]Look at all this.
[68:16.41]You did all this detail work.
[68:19.03]Ah, you're way too kind.
[68:20.27]No, because, I mean, you want to make it look nice for Christmas, you know?
[68:25.67]I mean, like, you know, I love this game.
[68:28.77]And I want to... Even if I only got 20 minutes, I want to make sure I try and do it right and cram in...
[68:33.68]as much of those little bits that I can.
[68:35.54]We left out some cookies and milk for Santa.
[68:37.68]Oh, this is cookies and milk!
[68:38.82]I didn't, I couldn't even, oh my god!
[68:40.56]No, Grant, there's cookies and milk, and we actually left out some carrots for the reindeer as well, which would be like a tradition in my house.
[68:47.98]Actually, a fun little thing in my house.
[68:51.12]Santa in my house, when he used to visit back in the day, actually liked cookies, and because Santa didn't drink milk, he actually liked a touch of alcohol.
[68:58.79]so we've actually left a bottle of whiskey on the fireplace there oh by the way don't want to cut you off 20 minutes is up for the second build second builders stop it stop it stop it stop it 20 minutes is up it's all good oh hang on hello gag sorry
[69:18.00]I love the pineapple too.
[69:20.50]The pineapple is fucking good.
[69:22.24]The pineapple is there because that's a pineapple cake.
[69:24.73]That was the idea.
[69:25.57]We actually colored the icing because you can edit that now.
[69:28.51]Alright, let's get your grade up here.
[69:30.91]RT gets a 96.
[69:35.90]Whoa!
[69:36.74]Whoa!
[69:38.24]Yeah, it was great.
[69:39.54]What is chat screen?
[69:41.22]I mean, if you want to see, I mean, just look, guys.
[69:43.19]Come on.
[69:43.47]Just keep building, Connor.
[69:44.73]Look, let me show you.
[69:46.09]You're way too kind.
[69:47.39]I hope everyone did well in the round there.
[69:49.87]He's got like ice trimming.
[69:51.83]He's got, look at this.
[69:53.57]Where's the dinner?
[69:54.89]Right here.
[69:56.07]He's got milk and cookies out for Santa.
[69:58.27]That's actually really sweet that he's got milk and cookies out.
[70:01.23]Look at all these great images of Santa.
[70:03.09]The images are great.
[70:05.06]I'm not pumped about dinner, I'll say.
[70:08.54]Well, they're actually serving desserts at the moment, you know?
[70:11.24]Is that two tomatoes?
[70:12.88]It's candied apples.
[70:13.58]Oh, I thought it was two tomatoes.
[70:15.38]And my favorite, a buffalo chicken sub.
[70:18.70]You're kind of not showing us at all.
[70:21.16]Oh, shit.
[70:21.46]Sorry.
[70:24.33]Hey, take a look.
[70:27.54]It actually is impressive how fast you're able to build.
[70:30.52]And to lose to you again would be an honor and an insult.
[70:34.06]You're way too kind.
[70:35.52]At the same time.
[70:36.22]Alright, so player B, you're free to hang out now.
[70:38.95]We're just going to do the tours.
[70:39.91]We've got another one.
[70:40.55]We've got number four coming up here.
[70:41.79]Who is number four?
[70:42.75]Oh, that's me.
[70:43.75]That is Vinny.
[70:44.25]Alright, Vinny, let me get you built.
[70:45.77]Thank you, RT.
[70:46.37]Great job, as always.
[70:47.61]Thank you very much.
[70:48.73]Nice work.
[70:49.35]Let me get Vinny's up.
[70:54.05]Real quick, Jerma, are we going to go through all of these builds and then start the 90-minute build together?
[70:59.24]Yes.
[71:00.24]Okay.
[71:00.38]So I guess we'll talk about that after, but at the end of all these tours, what we're going to do is you're going to pick who goes first.
[71:07.66]You're going to pick who builds first.
[71:10.61]Alright.
[71:10.87]So let's get going here.
[71:12.07]Let me grab yours, Vinny.
[71:14.59]Okay.
[71:18.73]Yours is right here.
[71:21.67]So are we all touring this house now as if we're interested in buying?
[71:28.37]Yeah, you guys are free to hang out.
[71:29.71]The only thing I would ask is to mute while I'm getting the tour.
[71:32.85]Okay.
[71:33.05]But after that, yeah, absolutely.
[71:36.07]Absolutely, you're free to hang out and discuss after.
[71:39.13]Are you Discord sharing?
[71:40.69]I am Discord sharing right now if you want to watch it.
[71:45.66]Alright, Vinny, let's do it.
[71:47.78]Okay.
[71:52.95]There you are.
[71:53.55]There we go.
[71:54.67]Alright.
[71:56.47]Every time I... It's so funny.
[71:57.87]Oh my god, what the fuck is all this?
[71:59.94]I love how I start the inside.
[72:00.84]I don't know why I started there.
[72:01.58]Sorry.
[72:01.78]Yeah, that's weird.
[72:04.84]Every time I open somebody's file, my computer freezes.
[72:07.54]Look at this.
[72:09.46]My stream, my cam freezes every time.
[72:11.66]It's so weird.
[72:13.42]Why the fuck does this happen?
[72:17.20]Hey, there we are.
[72:17.70]Okay.
[72:18.74]Alright, Vinny, are we ready?
[72:20.42]Let me get this off the screen.
[72:21.52]We don't need the timer right now.
[72:22.66]Okay, I am ready.
[72:24.27]Please guide me through your home.
[72:26.55]Okay.
[72:27.83]As you can see here, we have a nice exterior.
[72:31.01]I chose a nice little stone exterior.
[72:32.57]You have some rocks and mushrooms.
[72:34.73]And also it says mmm in the vines there to signify that mmm, this is going to be some tasty food in the house.
[72:43.16]Okay.
[72:43.76]Alright.
[72:44.48]Okay.
[72:44.80]Does it go around?
[72:46.42]No.
[72:46.70]Still cool.
[72:47.44]I like the outside decorations.
[72:50.64]Thank you.
[72:51.12]Thank you.
[72:51.42]Very nice.
[72:51.84]Alright.
[72:53.46]Anything outside?
[72:55.50]No.
[72:55.82]Just kept it simple.
[72:56.94]And I did wrap the texture around.
[73:00.34]So as you can see here, I chose a nice fish themed wallpaper with some lavender trimming because I thought that would look quite nice.
[73:08.50]Very pretty.
[73:10.24]I have some photos of food on the wall.
[73:13.68]What?
[73:14.86]Oh, it's a traditional Italian dinner.
[73:17.27]You know, I'm an Italian New Yorker, and this is kind of what we grew up with, you know.
[73:22.05]Jesus Christ.
[73:24.01]It's romantic, though, because there's some candles on the table.
[73:27.76]This is like, they used to make the Super Nintendo commercials where, remember when the guy, like, ate all the fucking pizza and he blew up or whatever it was for Yoshi's Island?
[73:35.79]uh you know I might have seen that recently and forgot it but yeah that's what's going on here uh and also the pizza is you can tell the pizza was really good and uh very enjoyable so that's that's a traditional New York italian meal what is it on the pizza I don't know what's on the pizza what's on the what is it on this pizza is somebody puke on this I don't know what's on that pizza maybe blue cheese
[74:03.65]Maybe a little Italiano Alfredo sauce.
[74:05.83]I'm not sure.
[74:06.33]What's going on here?
[74:07.17]I will say this.
[74:08.01]I will say this.
[74:08.89]Let me interject and you say this.
[74:11.12]That is not mildew.
[74:14.20]It's mildew.
[74:16.24]And he's not disqualified.
[74:18.16]No, it's Alfredo sauce.
[74:21.14]It's Alfredo sauce.
[74:21.96]Dude, can you imagine having a fucking painting like this in your house?
[74:27.36]I thought it was a cool way to, you know, just to, again, some nice photos of food I've collected over the years.
[74:33.20]That one is, I got a nice couch if you want to sit under the Ronald Reagan pie.
[74:38.91]And some bean.
[74:42.65]It's my orange friend.
[74:44.33]Cool.
[74:45.07]Okay.
[74:45.57]Alright.
[74:45.93]What's with the beans?
[74:46.93]Banana.
[74:50.70]oh okay alright alright it's well I mean technically it's dinner so that's that's pretty much it's a simple little rustic abode gordon ramsay would probably like it and uh I hope you come over for our italian dinner what's on the floor oh gross moldy pizza that's -2 points sorry no no no that's not moldy that's uh alfredo sauce someone was because the food was so delicious
[75:12.33]uh this is this is great I would say this is I would call this fantastic I think it's very well made very well done I love I love what you did with the trim thank you I love what you did with the photos I love the cabinets this is a nice touch uh I'm gonna oh this is hard okay I'm gonna give you it you're in the a's uh
[75:37.60]it's good it's good it's a this is a 90 this is a 93. this is a 93. uh thank you it's a 94. this is a 94. it's awesome
[75:49.93]You know what?
[75:50.29]What really sold me was all this fucking pizza just thrown over here.
[75:53.09]This is great.
[75:54.17]Yeah, because, like, again, like, yeah, the pizza-splosion, and it's so good, you just want so much of it.
[75:59.90]And it's like, again, we Italian New Yorkers, we eat with our hands, we talk with our hands.
[76:04.28]So, for us, just having a bunch of pizza on a table is like Christmas.
[76:09.18]What happened here?
[76:13.33]Oh, it's not clipping.
[76:17.91]I was going to take two points off, but you are correct.
[76:22.29]It's not clipping.
[76:23.15]This is not clipping.
[76:26.56]What?
[76:28.04]How did you manage to?
[76:29.88]Okay.
[76:30.88]Can I get an extra point because it's not clipping?
[76:35.02]I'm kidding.
[76:35.50]That was a joke.
[76:36.20]That's fine.
[76:36.70]It's you and Ronald Reagan.
[76:37.70]You were 93.
[76:38.04]Now you're 94.
[76:40.25]Cool.
[76:40.95]I'm happy with that very much.
[76:42.11]Thank you, Jeremy.
[76:42.59]Vinny, congratulations.
[76:43.79]Wonderful chat.
[76:44.23]What are you going to give Vinny's first house here?
[76:46.71]An A?
[76:47.17]You got an A. That's a 95.
[76:48.45]Oh, shit.
[76:49.51]This is going to be a tight competition.
[76:53.79]If everybody would like to chime in, you're free to do so right now.
[77:00.17]No notes.
[77:00.83]Vinny, it's perfect.
[77:03.41]Thanks, man.
[77:03.77]Nice job, Vinny.
[77:05.29]Thanks, Criken.
[77:08.19]That's a good volume of pizza, you know?
[77:10.83]It is a lot.
[77:12.13]Sometimes you worry you don't have enough pizza, but, like, we've got, like, the pizza cube, if you will.
[77:17.34]Yeah.
[77:18.84]Like, there's just constant pizza.
[77:20.86]Traditional New York pizza dish.
[77:23.02]I like the variety.
[77:24.04]Deep dish.
[77:25.32]Grab and go, you know?
[77:26.74]Pick a favorite out.
[77:28.30]There's one for everybody.
[77:29.27]That's true.
[77:29.67]One with the Alfredo sauce.
[77:31.73]Like, there's enough there to last you until the new year.
[77:36.00]Yeah, that's a lot of pizza.
[77:37.22]That's like at least two or three weeks.
[77:41.25]Alright, I got Northernlion.
[77:42.55]I've got his build coming in here.
[77:45.35]Are you in here?
[77:47.65]I am in here.
[77:48.85]Nice.
[77:50.37]Do I just capture your stream for this and you're going to do the tour and I'll narrate?
[77:55.07]Yeah, the screen share right now.
[77:57.39]It's like a 30 FPS.
[77:59.67]We did it the opposite way last time, but just way easier for me to see.
[78:02.61]It's fine.
[78:04.39]Jeremy, I have a very quick question now because we're doing this in teams.
[78:08.85]Is our score accumulating together?
[78:10.79]Like this team is.
[78:12.87]Oh, so, so, so what you are doing right now is worth 10% of your overall grade for the entire event.
[78:19.67]Oh, oh, 10%.
[78:21.01]Okay.
[78:21.43]10%.
[78:21.77]It was, I was like an hire before, but now, alright, so let me go this property browser.
[78:26.77]Let's go here.
[78:27.43]Alright.
[78:28.09]Uh, we are ready.
[78:29.07]We are almost ready.
[78:29.87]Okay.
[78:34.09]There you are.
[78:35.05]Alright.
[78:37.76]I got you.
[78:39.06]There you are.
[78:42.18]Loading up.
[78:44.36]You're going to want to start outside of this one.
[78:45.94]Let me get out of here.
[78:48.12]Let me get out of here for a second.
[78:49.96]Let me reset my camera because my computer sucks.
[78:52.98]Okay.
[78:53.44]Okay.
[78:55.82]And we reactivate.
[78:56.68]Okay.
[78:57.58]So are we good to go?
[79:00.25]I'm going to turn around and can you see the screen share?
[79:03.06]I can.
[79:03.50]I'm ready to go.
[79:04.18]OK.
[79:06.14]Very nice.
[79:06.60]So what we cooked up is, I would call it an homage to the mid-century American family dinner.
[79:14.30]It's meant to remind you of the past in broad themes and evoke the feeling of childhood and also just the feeling of nourishment that you got not just from the food, but also from spending time with those you love.
[79:30.37]OK.
[79:31.64]Just do some tasting notes before you enter the establishment.
[79:35.48]I've done it myself.
[79:37.04]Can I ask a question?
[79:38.94]Yes.
[79:40.40]Before I go in, is this... I'm loving it?
[79:46.91]I hope you're loving it.
[79:48.09]The last two teams, I think they got like a 97 and a 94.
[79:51.37]So I would love to be in that same sort of ballpark.
[79:55.58]Anything outside, I should look at first.
[79:59.18]Originally, we had big plans for introducing the new concept of a drive-thru, but unfortunately, we just ran out of budget.
[80:09.51]And I would definitely tell you not to take a look at the top of the roof, because there's still some cobwebs and some construction we're working on.
[80:17.31]We haven't painted all the terracotta yet, but we're doing what we can.
[80:21.24]Okay, so... Your webcam's stuck in a great spot.
[80:27.88]Okay, I love it already because I love the fact that you made a drive-through.
[80:31.95]That's very creative.
[80:33.07]That's a lot of points right off the bat.
[80:34.59]That's very dinner.
[80:35.47]Alright, I'm going to go in.
[80:38.11]This is the drive-through window, I'm assuming, right?
[80:40.25]Yes, that was supposed to be the drive-through window.
[80:42.12]Okay, very cool.
[80:43.96]I'm going to go in.
[80:45.90]And I think one of the things that's great about this is that it's sort of like what you see is what you get.
[80:51.45]It's a very accessible piece of architecture.
[80:55.19]There's not a whole lot that needs any explaining.
[80:58.07]You can just kind of go in here and soak it in.
[81:00.47]And if you've got any questions, I'm more than happy to answer them.
[81:04.32]Okay.
[81:05.32]So I have one very quick question right off the bat.
[81:08.54]These tables...
[81:10.92]are a little scuffed.
[81:12.58]I feel like if I was a franchise owner, I'd probably be like, what's going on with these tables here?
[81:17.23]You would say scuffed.
[81:18.67]What I would say as the proprietor of the establishment is just clear that these tables are well loved.
[81:23.09]They've been used and they've created a lot of memories.
[81:26.25]And those memories that have been created have also imprinted permanently on the furniture.
[81:29.76]So there's always that interplay between the person inside of the establishment and the infrastructure of the establishment itself.
[81:37.74]No man ever dips his toe into the same river twice because it is in the same river and it is in the same man.
[81:44.45]Okay.
[81:45.33]Wow, that was an unbelievable explanation to make sure that that letter grade stayed very high.
[81:49.95]Okay, very good.
[81:51.61]This poster is wrong.
[81:53.53]What happened?
[81:55.61]Uh, it's not, it's not wrong.
[81:57.64]It's portrait mode.
[81:59.36]This is how Gen Z likes to, uh, look at things.
[82:02.28]They look at them from a, uh, nine, uh, six by 19 aspect ratio instead of a 16 by nine.
[82:08.32]That good answer.
[82:11.05]Very good answer.
[82:11.69]Okay.
[82:11.85]I'm like, I'm like the food here.
[82:13.49]I love the theme.
[82:14.35]This is imagining this is the menus probably.
[82:16.93]Yes.
[82:17.23]Those are the menu boards.
[82:18.39]Very nice.
[82:19.37]Beautiful, beautiful work.
[82:21.64]OK, I I think I I think I know I this is if they're all high so far.
[82:26.32]This is this is great.
[82:27.40]Alright, so here's here's the score I'm going to give you.
[82:31.00]For your first build, I'm going to give you an.
[82:33.13]Today.
[82:36.21]It's an A that's that's not that's a straight up.
[82:38.87]This is this is a.
[82:41.88]If it wasn't, okay, if it wasn't a drive-through, if you didn't give me the drive-through pitch, maybe it wouldn't be, maybe an A-, but this is, I love the philosophy on this.
[82:53.53]You're going to get a 95.
[82:56.03]Thank you so much.
[82:57.31]Very good.
[82:57.85]Just for future reference, is there anything I could do for our next build to help make up that five-point difference?
[83:04.76]A Marge Simpson impression.
[83:07.26]Alright.
[83:08.28]I'll get working.
[83:10.97]No, this is great.
[83:11.53]Alright, so chat, what are you going to give Northernlion?
[83:16.21]These are all great scores so far.
[83:17.75]I think you guys know what you're doing.
[83:21.87]I do want to say I had a lot of help from my partner on this one.
[83:25.29]This wouldn't look nearly as impressive if it weren't for Squeaks' help.
[83:29.88]Yeah.
[83:30.18]Oh, thank you.
[83:31.02]That's why it's teams.
[83:32.00]And Squeaks, you got built, and we're going to see yours pretty soon here.
[83:35.30]Oh, I have to send it to you.
[83:37.10]Yeah, in that basement uploads.
[83:39.58]Oh, gotcha.
[83:40.34]Awesome.
[83:40.78]And now it looks like we got a 95.
[83:42.62]Chad has given you a 95.
[83:43.55]This is a lot of A's.
[83:45.63]He's going to improve your guys later score because I know some of you are going to have a scuffed ass build three.
[83:49.75]So these are the points you want to have right now.
[83:53.21]Awesome.
[83:53.51]Alright.
[83:53.83]Well, nice.
[83:55.23]You're on the line.
[83:56.37]Thank you.
[83:56.79]I appreciate it.
[83:59.09]So let's get to who's next.
[84:02.34]I love the fucking McDonald's.
[84:04.68]We got Esvin and Bonnie.
[84:06.30]Alright.
[84:06.62]Do we do we have are they are they here?
[84:09.54]Hey, Anna.
[84:11.32]Hello.
[84:11.90]Hey.
[84:12.98]Let me get your file.
[84:18.05]So, how do you feel as a fan?
[84:20.43]You feel good?
[84:21.79]Oh, I'm feeling fantastic.
[84:24.17]Cool.
[84:25.15]Hi.
[84:25.55]Yeah.
[84:26.35]Do you feel confident?
[84:27.31]Do you think you did okay?
[84:29.14]Yeah.
[84:30.22]Yeah.
[84:31.92]Yeah.
[84:32.28]Yeah, we did pretty good.
[84:34.44]I'm excited.
[84:39.34]OK, let's do we're very excited.
[84:42.48]Here is yours.
[84:43.80]I'm going to open it.
[84:44.80]I'm not going to look.
[84:45.94]I'm going to fly out immediately.
[84:47.25]I went to the bathroom actually for a long time.
[84:50.75]I'm sick, so.
[84:52.67]I wasn't really here for a lot of this.
[84:55.61]OK, I'm going to go over here.
[84:59.29]Oh, this is the entrance.
[85:01.27]OK, OK, OK, OK.
[85:02.89]Yes, let me.
[85:04.43]I don't want to spoil it because the grades are up there, so let's take this off.
[85:08.52]And I don't know, my camera just keeps, like, dying.
[85:11.42]Whatever, we'll turn it on again.
[85:12.60]When it dies, it dies.
[85:13.32]Whatever.
[85:13.56]Alright, can you see?
[85:18.69]Can I explain?
[85:20.01]Uh, I mean... What would you like to explain, Bonnie?
[85:25.81]Like, I just remember you built this so well, and then, like... It was, like, the top of the town, so much so that it got robbed, and everyone... Yeah, I don't know...
[85:36.53]Yeah, I can expand on this.
[85:38.95]Alright, so where do you want me to start?
[85:42.67]Well, you can start right where you're standing.
[85:45.07]Okay.
[85:46.59]I like the green.
[85:48.40]Thank you.
[85:50.94]Do you have any questions right off the bat?
[85:53.84]Yes, I have a very important question.
[85:56.24]What is going on over here?
[85:58.63]That is a structural design mistake.
[86:05.38]Not by us, but by the people who originally built this restaurant, actually.
[86:10.20]This is an Italian Seaside seafood restaurant, as you can see.
[86:17.09]And they made the mistake of building a giant window in the restaurant.
[86:22.45]Well, okay.
[86:23.35]They were robbed.
[86:24.53]They were robbed because somebody broke through the window and they stole everything.
[86:28.57]Oh shit.
[86:29.71]Okay.
[86:30.31]I get it.
[86:30.97]They, it was robbed.
[86:32.55]Yes.
[86:34.02]Oh, okay.
[86:35.48]Yes.
[86:35.86]Alright.
[86:36.80]Let me go.
[86:37.16]Let me, let me take, let me take a look.
[86:39.10]Let me take a look.
[86:40.50]We, we really needed the money to put this up.
[86:43.18]So we actually rented from, we went, we, you know, we were going with an Italian theme and we actually ended up, um, getting involved in,
[86:52.52]know the mafia the mafia okay so whenever this whenever this restaurant was built uh they didn't have the money to afford it so they took out a loan from the mafia what ended up happening and I didn't really want to explain this initially is that they couldn't they weren't they weren't cutting it you know apparently there wasn't a huge need for a Seaside italian seafood restaurant
[87:16.71]and they weren't able to pay back the loans that they got from the mafia and that is when they came in and broke the window stole everything inside and then proceeded to break their legs as well also that's uh that tile out there is um that was you know going to be repurposed but it would yeah um I I have a few I have a few quick opinions um I Mike I have a very important question as is this a restaurant right um
[87:42.88]Well, it was.
[87:43.48]Now it's abandoned.
[87:44.18]And that's where all the moss from the outside comes from.
[87:46.58]Real quickly, in like 10 seconds, what is the philosophy of having like a bush as the outside of the restaurant?
[87:53.80]Oh, that's actually moss that has grown on the wall because it's abandoned after it was robbed.
[87:58.20]Oh, okay.
[87:58.89]Yeah.
[88:00.39]The sprinklers were just left on for a very long time.
[88:02.69]Okay.
[88:05.63]right well here's what I'm gonna give you uh I will tell you uh the story the story helped you a little bit here uh unfortunately the build I know you guys had last second there's a little bit more to the story just a little bit okay so we were actually like gonna repurpose this what we decided to do is we decided to go with girl dinner and I don't know if you've heard of girl
[88:31.18]What is girl dinner?
[88:33.40]It's like, you know, when you don't want to eat something.
[88:35.46]So instead you go girl dinner and it could be like something like it could be a nothing or it could be something small.
[88:40.96]So that's why that's why you see the pink with the fish.
[88:43.25]And if you notice, like, you know, it's pretty creative.
[88:45.41]The the the the flooring is actually ocean themed, which is very, very nice.
[88:50.49]It looks like the ocean, even though it's marble.
[88:53.19]And so the reason why it's empty also is because girl dinner, girl dinner.
[88:58.09]Right.
[88:58.39]That's fantastic.
[89:01.03]You can tell why this went out of business, actually.
[89:03.81]You can tell why they sold literally nothing.
[89:05.39]I got a grade for you.
[89:06.69]I am going to give you... It's not... This is not bad.
[89:10.57]This is not bad, okay?
[89:11.87]Don't think this is bad.
[89:13.65]I'm going to give you guys... I'm going to give you... You saved some points there with the story.
[89:20.40]I was going to go with D, but that has been changed from the story.
[89:25.96]I'm going to give you guys a solid.
[89:29.84]72.
[89:29.86]No, 71.
[89:30.00]71.
[89:30.06]Oh, yes.
[89:31.12]Let's go.
[89:31.62]I'll give you a C mark.
[89:37.65]Because here's why.
[89:39.89]You guys just created a story and then built a little house.
[89:48.78]You were like, okay, obviously, I mean, what was it?
[89:55.51]got robbed yeah I mean you got robbed and of time like the five seconds really made a difference I think probably yeah but no I I I enjoy the story but the build could use a little improvement but it was very very nice very well very well told story thank you we used all of our experience that we had with House Flipper at our all of our tools he's a sucker for a narrative thank you thank you yeah nice job
[90:23.34]So we'll get to the next house.
[90:25.72]Thank you, Esvin and Bonnie.

[90:31.55]Chat, chat, chat.
[90:32.13]What are you going to give it?
[90:36.33]What does chat give this house?
[90:38.69]And don't listen to them if they give something stupid.
[90:45.45]Chat gave a 65.
[90:46.89]Okay, so chat gave you guys a 65.
[90:49.14]Let's go!
[90:51.27]So you're at a 69.5 on this house, which is still, I guess that's a C minus, I guess, technically D plus.

[92:35.88]Where am I going?
[92:49.34]Do I not have a guide?
[92:50.08]What the fuck is going on?
[92:58.58]Oh, by the way, Connor, CDawg, stop building.
[93:01.08]What the fuck?
[93:08.40]Whoa, shit!
[93:09.02]Ew.
[93:24.35]Wait, is there more in here?
[93:28.79]Oh my God.
[93:29.61]This is so scary.
[93:35.61]Okay, did I get to the end?
[93:37.67]Okay, you can put the music on.
[93:39.61]Okay, put the music on.
[93:41.07]That was fucking awesome.
[93:46.33]I think I'm going to have to go camless.
[93:48.31]I don't know why this keeps doing this.
[93:49.59]Whoa, I don't want to do that.
[93:51.76]Alright, Poke, that was atmospherically phenomenal.
[93:57.44]I think atmosphere-wise that this is an A+.
[93:59.78]I couldn't have done it without Ster.
[94:01.60]Honestly, Ster was like 90% of the idea.
[94:04.90]I mean, this is very, very, very, very high.
[94:07.62]The one thing I'm going to tell you, you're going to get a pretty major point deduction here, unfortunately.
[94:13.43]I hate to say it.
[94:15.05]What is the dinner aspect?
[94:16.91]Jeremiah, you fool.
[94:19.17]You are the dinner.
[94:21.08]oh god never mind okay okay okay alright yes this is this is an a plus how did you what how did you like black out the whole thing I don't know I I don't think he knows actually I think that's a real answer
[94:46.70]this is awesome alright uh this is great uh this is this is probably the highest score of the day just because of you know you went underground you you took the theme and you kind of twisted it a little bit I I love that I love that idea uh I mean this is this is gonna be uh this is a 98. this is a 98 yes
[95:13.66]Thank you.
[95:14.48]The music, too.
[95:16.04]You kind of went the extra mile.
[95:17.46]That is a 98 for Poke.
[95:21.15]And Ster.
[95:22.53]Chat is also giving you a 95.
[95:23.89]Let's go, Ster!

[95:38.91]If there's one thing I can say, please, can you keep your cam on?
[95:40.95]The freezing is just honestly worth it.
[95:42.85]Yeah, you gotta keep turning it on, man.
[95:44.81]You need to just keep refreshing it as much as you can.
[95:46.99]That's all.
[95:47.45]I'm gonna meet now.
[95:48.16]Thank you.
[95:50.04]I have to follow up that.
[95:51.54]This is the worst day of my life.
[95:54.38]No, no, no.
[95:55.88]We got this.
[95:57.20]This is the worst day of my life.
[95:59.57]You don't want to know where you go on the worst day of your life.
[96:02.75]You go to our build.
[96:04.29]You'll see.
[96:04.75]You'll see.
[96:06.41]Alright.
[96:07.36]So who is this?
[96:08.10]Is this Will or Snuffy or Will?
[96:09.26]This is Will.
[96:10.26]This is my house.
[96:11.58]I am opening it right now.
[96:12.96]Give me one second.
[96:13.76]I was told...
[96:16.62]There might be bonus points for Simpson's impression.
[96:20.22]A Marge Simpson impression?
[96:21.64]I'm considering it.
[96:22.36]Well, this isn't Marge, but I do do a good Troy McClure.
[96:27.44]So I've written a house tour from the perspective of the late, great Troy McClure.
[96:35.57]Okay, so repeat that one more time.
[96:38.23]Troy McClure?
[96:39.15]Yeah, just my audio cut out.
[96:41.79]Oh, yeah.
[96:43.39]He's going to be giving you the house tour today.
[96:45.17]Okay, so Troy McClure is going to be giving me the tour.
[96:49.73]Yes.
[96:49.91]Okay, let me make sure I get to the front.
[96:51.15]Start outside.
[96:52.13]Yep.
[96:52.71]Let me get this off the screen.
[96:55.87]The camera is already fucked up.
[96:58.06]That's so stupid.
[96:58.88]Yep.
[97:00.56]I love how you can hear it struggling.
[97:03.12]That's funny.
[97:06.28]think in your camera you were you were like it looks like you were kissing your fingers like a like an italian like dinner like that's beautiful beautiful beautiful dinner right that's a good intro you already know what's about to happen oh right ready I'm ready
[97:19.23]Okay.
[97:20.01]Hi there.
[97:21.05]I'm Troy McClure, and you might remember me from such commercials as the Pasta Paradiso and the Risotto Rendezvous.
[97:29.65]Today, I'm here to introduce you to a dining experience like none other, the Olive Garden.
[97:35.68]Introducing their new senior living experience, the Risotto Rendezvous, or sorry, the Ricotta Rendezvous.
[97:43.20]Will, Will, hold on.
[97:43.94]I'm going to cut you off.
[97:45.00]I can't open the door.
[97:47.51]That's user error.
[97:49.55]That's a skill gap.
[97:51.41]I think the Ivy or whatever is here is blocking the door.
[97:57.09]Hold on.
[97:58.44]Just go fly mode.
[97:59.78]Alright.
[98:00.46]Pretty sick.
[98:01.16]Alright.
[98:01.52]I'm in.
[98:04.36]Jesus Christ.
[98:05.12]That's a skill issue for sure.
[98:06.42]Okay.
[98:07.00]Alright.
[98:07.28]Continue.
[98:08.56]Picture this.
[98:09.97]You, your friends, and your family are all gathered together in a warm and welcoming embrace of the Olive Garden.
[98:17.43]It's like stepping into a little slice of Italy right in your neighborhood.
[98:22.47]Try our new Oops All Breadsticks Dinner happening now.
[98:29.50]I'm happy to answer any questions.
[98:34.48]It's great.
[98:35.56]First of all, I love the outside.
[98:37.28]Let me tell you.
[98:39.16]You're getting a monstrous amount of points just because of the outside.
[98:43.77]Thank you.
[98:44.27]That is identical.
[98:46.49]That is identical to what an Olive Garden looks like outside.
[98:49.29]Thank you.
[98:50.31]It is like the exact color, the exact type of stone.
[98:52.89]It is perfect.
[98:54.82]So you're getting huge points for that.
[98:56.92]I do love the Oops All Breadsticks.
[98:59.22]I think that's... Yes.
[99:00.50]I like that a lot.
[99:02.02]Is this olive oil?
[99:03.46]They wanted to go beyond, you know, just unlimited breadsticks, and now it's only breadsticks.
[99:12.34]Is this wine?
[99:13.78]Everybody's got a copious amount of olive oil to sip on while you enjoy your olives.
[99:18.41]It's just bottles of olive oil and sweet berry wine.
[99:24.62]This is great.
[99:26.24]I am going to tell you the build inside is good.
[99:30.90]The build outside is great.
[99:32.57]So I am going to, I think I've got to, unless anything else you want me to see, anything else you'd like to add?
[99:36.97]Because I think I've got a pretty good idea.
[99:39.55]uh no I think you got a pretty good um idea of what's going on here it's an Olive Garden you took the restaurant you took the theme and you made a restaurant I love it yeah nothing says dinner to me like the warm embrace of some alfredo served up hot at the Olive Garden hey all of Olive Garden sometimes doesn't miss I just gotta make sure I say that everybody gonna leave though
[100:06.45]I just lost 10,000 viewers.
[100:08.91]Alright.
[100:10.86]Yeah.
[100:11.46]I think this deserves a high B. I'm going to give you, I'm going to say probably somewhere around, I want to say, I want to say B plus.
[100:20.03]I'm going to give you, I'm going to give you an 80.
[100:21.23]I'll give you an 87.
[100:25.41]I'm going to give you an 87.
[100:26.43]I'll take it.
[100:30.38]The only critique that I have, the only critique that I have is I may have wanted to see the tables maybe spread out a little more.
[100:41.85]Because I feel like if I sit here, I don't want to sit next to this asshole.
[100:46.33]You know what I mean?
[100:47.59]Give me like two tables.
[100:48.51]Get it.
[100:48.87]I don't want to sit next to fucking two people.
[100:51.09]Too close for me.
[100:52.41]I like spread out restaurants.
[100:53.86]Although you did only have a small space and you worked with it well.
[100:57.78]Thank you.
[100:58.38]Thank you.
[100:59.02]That is an 87.

[103:27.19]Okay.
[103:28.39]Give me one second.
[103:31.97]There we go.
[103:32.85]Let me make sure my camera will freeze in like 10 seconds.
[103:35.37]Okay.
[103:36.11]Can you see?
[103:37.63]Yes.
[103:37.81]Alright.
[103:38.45]I am ready for your tour.
[103:40.05]Ready to go.
[103:41.31]Okay.
[103:43.72]Well, first of all, I just want to be aware of our surroundings out here.
[103:47.12]We are on the beach.
[103:48.94]Sure.
[103:49.16]If you look out into the distance, you might even see some fishermen coming back to shore right now to become fishers of men.
[103:58.83]Now, I think we're ready to go inside.
[104:00.03]Okay.
[104:02.37]I was looking for the fishermen.
[104:04.21]That's a great view.
[104:05.39]They're just really far out there on the horizon.
[104:07.45]Okay.
[104:10.66]Now, welcome in.
[104:13.62]You may have seen the First Supper and the Second Supper, but have you seen the Last Supper?
[104:21.25]That is where we are today.
[104:23.43]You may have noticed you stepped over Jesus there without really giving him too much thought.
[104:27.71]Oh, shit!
[104:28.34]Okay, yeah.
[104:28.96]Yeah.
[104:29.98]He does have to bring himself lower than anyone else in the room in order to show you what being humble really means.
[104:39.40]Can I just say, I love the fact that... So there's been... This is the third Last Supper, but they've been very different.
[104:47.10]No, no, no.
[104:47.70]This is the last supper.
[104:49.68]Oh.
[104:50.02]We're the last ones.
[104:51.08]This is the final supper.
[104:52.78]You can't be the last supper if you're the first supper.
[104:55.32]Do you understand?
[104:56.08]But you put... Okay, so Ludwig had chairs representing people and then food on the table.
[105:02.43]You have the picture and then food in front of each person.
[105:07.03]Yeah, it's like an exercise in sort of making the picture pop out like a 3D book.
[105:14.08]Oh, it's 3D.
[105:15.14]Okay.
[105:15.48]This is a 3D image.
[105:18.24]Yeah, because like in The Last Supper, there's no chairs on this side of the table.
[105:23.64]What's going on here?
[105:25.14]Okay.
[105:25.96]I know what you're thinking, but hear me out.
[105:29.09]Who is that?
[105:31.01]That is Neo from The Matrix.
[105:33.26]Okay, Neo, the word, Greek for new.
[105:38.37]Jesus, New Testament.
[105:41.97]Neo, the one, the chosen one.
[105:45.27]Who else is the chosen one, I ask you?
[105:48.71]Jesus.
[105:49.85]So of course he's invited.
[105:51.95]Oh, so he's invited.
[105:53.22]I like that.
[105:55.64]That's good.
[105:56.06]That gives you some points here.
[105:58.54]Now, unfortunately, there's not unleavened bread here.
[106:02.21]in House Flipper 2 yet.
[106:03.59]So we did give them what we had available at the time.
[106:06.47]Hopefully they will forgive us.
[106:07.89]And we have grapes presented for each person to start making and fermenting their own wine, which is pretty straightforward.
[106:14.67]You just need to, you know, add yeast, keep it warm, mash it with your feet first.
[106:19.32]And it might take a while, but the ingredients are there.
[106:23.40]Well, I will say that Ludwig had the gamer last supper.
[106:29.43]Conrad's Pants had the well-lit mural, and you've got this one.
[106:34.68]Have you noticed the chairs on the end?
[106:38.32]Yeah, what's the chair?
[106:39.00]One of them is red.
[106:39.66]Do you know who else in Scripture is commonly red?
[106:44.28]The devil.
[106:44.80]Do you know who was inspired by the devil to betray Jesus at the Last Supper?
[106:51.59]Judas.
[106:52.09]That's Judas' chair.
[106:53.77]Oh, so who's in the pink chair?
[106:57.21]That's for Neal.
[106:59.17]Okay, alright, cool.
[106:59.79]Alright, anything outside?
[107:02.03]Anything on the outside or anything on... Listen, Jesus was a very humble man who lived humbly.
[107:13.10]He has said that it is harder for a rich man to get to heaven
[107:17.72]than it is for him to go through the... It's harder to go through the eye of a needle than to go to heaven.
[107:22.72]He has to give away all of his possessions and give them to the poor.
[107:26.80]So we have honored that and tried to live minimally.
[107:31.58]Minimalistically.
[107:33.04]I like the story.
[107:34.06]I think the story is carrying this a lot.
[107:36.90]I would have... I understand the theme of, you know, minimalist on the outside.
[107:41.62]But I'm gonna... I gotta think I got a score for you.
[107:44.75]My grade...
[107:46.93]Is it going to be B?
[107:49.31]It's going to be... Well, then... Well, he's got a gamer chair.
[107:51.21]He's got a gamer chair.
[107:52.11]Somebody just said, you can't give Jesus a B.
[108:08.87]Alright, chat, what are you giving?
[108:10.31]I'm giving an 80.
[108:11.35]It's at least a B. I'm giving 80.
[108:14.91]I think I'm just going straight up 85.
[108:17.93]I think I'm just going straight up 85.
[108:19.81]I like the story.
[108:21.87]The story was great.
[108:23.81]I like the 3D image.
[108:24.99]I like the fact that it's supposed to be 3D.
[108:27.94]I think it was Jesus who said that seas get degrees, so I'm fine with anything above that.
[108:33.50]I do appreciate the 3D image because that was a great way to describe that.
[108:39.43]But chat's giving a B too.
[108:40.47]So that's 85.
[108:41.21]And that's all build A's, right?
[108:49.26]I think so, yeah.
[108:50.40]Now we're going to go to build B's.
[108:52.50]So we're making pretty good time.
[108:53.70]I'm actually happy about how we're going through this.
[108:58.80]But yeah, Etalyx, great work.
[109:00.70]Thank you, thank you.
[109:01.36]Thank you.
[109:02.20]Thank you, Criken as well.
[109:03.40]Yeah, Criken, thanks as well.
[109:05.22]Good stuff.
[109:06.92]Alright, so now...
[109:09.11]CDawg, are you here?
[109:10.83]I am, yes.
[109:15.09]Alright, CDawg.
[109:16.59]So, I... I need... Do you have your... Put your file in the file spot?
[109:21.73]Okay, yeah.
[109:22.21]How do I... I'm sorry.
[109:23.91]I'm new to this.
[109:25.19]Yeah.
[109:25.89]So, if you go... Oh, my God.
[109:28.13]I just grabbed the fucking table.
[109:30.23]Just grabbed the last dinner's table, dude.
[109:32.23]What the fuck?
[109:33.75]Okay.
[109:34.37]So, if you go to... Hit a tab.
[109:36.72]Yep.
[109:37.38]And you go to property settings.
[109:39.89]And then at the bottom right, it's going to say export as mod.
[109:43.19]It's going to open a file menu.
[109:45.25]And then you take that and drop that into the basement uploads.
[109:47.90]And that'll be the file I need.
[109:49.40]Jerma, can I make a request?
[109:50.90]Sure.
[109:52.18]Can we not follow up Pokes group again?
[109:55.12]Can we shuffle that a little bit?
[109:57.44]Yeah.
[109:57.82]Because I think I definitely lost points because Pokes was so good.
[110:05.05]They're too strong.
[110:06.05]Yeah.
[110:08.86]We'll see.
[110:09.70]We'll see.
[110:10.90]Okay.
[110:11.24]Thank you.
[110:12.02]I will hear the request.
[110:13.80]I will hear the request.
[110:16.38]Okay.
[110:16.64]So, CDawg, we got your build, right?
[110:19.56]I do, yeah.
[110:21.60]I think I just put it in.
[110:22.80]Yep.
[110:23.54]So, I got it.
[110:24.68]I'm going to open it.
[110:25.36]Oh, gosh.
[110:27.36]I didn't freeze.
[110:28.10]Wow.
[110:28.44]What a fucking miracle.
[110:30.80]All these Jesus and Last Supper images.
[110:33.58]What a miracle.
[110:34.76]It's not turned off.
[110:37.11]Alright, you're gonna import yours.
[110:40.79]I don't think I named it or did anything.
[110:43.85]Break it, hopefully.
[110:45.65]Let's see.
[110:46.61]It's coming.
[110:47.63]There it is.
[110:49.53]Yep, I got it.
[110:50.03]Alright, nice.
[110:54.41]Jesus Christ.
[110:56.61]Hold on.
[110:57.29]What is the problem?
[110:58.97]I just saw like the first fucking image.
[111:01.69]Let me get the teams off.
[111:03.77]Because you're clicking edit instead of play.
[111:06.91]Don't do that.
[111:08.23]I want to be able to fly around.
[111:11.37]That's cheating.
[111:12.30]No, it's not.
[111:14.40]It's kind of cheating.
[111:15.30]Okay.
[111:16.20]I am ready for your tour.
[111:17.46]Alright.
[111:20.02]Right now.
[111:22.02]Welcome to the future.
[111:23.56]What are you looking at?
[111:26.60]How are you looking at the... Why is there more?
[111:29.88]Why is there more?
[111:31.12]Why is there more?
[111:32.04]Why is there more?
[111:34.83]Why did you build?
[111:35.99]Why did you build more?
[111:43.13]Wait, I actually don't know how that brick got outside.
[111:47.59]It was not like that earlier.
[111:50.17]Okay, so where am I starting?
[111:53.57]Let's start in whichever tower you prefer.
[111:58.56]Okay, let's start with this one.
[112:00.92]Alright.
[112:01.20]Okay.
[112:01.46]Okay.
[112:01.74]Alright.
[112:02.28]So if you enter through the door, which is... They're all the garage doors.
[112:08.50]I got very inspired by Poke last time.
[112:10.90]I loved them.
[112:12.62]And so... Oh, it's already open.
[112:15.64]Oh.
[112:15.88]Oh, is it?
[112:17.88]Oh, no.
[112:18.14]There we go.
[112:19.24]Oh, God.
[112:19.59]You got it.
[112:21.25]These are the... Me and Conor are racking our brain.
[112:24.43]We're thinking, what is the most, you know, important... Stop opening my doors.
[112:30.87]Okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna come up here.
[112:32.66]Yeah, right.
[112:34.36]You could just Oh, my God, dude.
[112:37.92]Okay, okay.
[112:39.10]Alright.
[112:41.00]I don't cut you off.
[112:44.46]Look around.
[112:44.80]Look around.
[112:45.20]I get a limb.
[112:45.90]Okay.
[112:47.22]There are remember, remember, the theme with this one was technological advancements.
[112:52.40]Hmm.
[112:52.78]Yeah.
[112:53.84]I'd like to hear a little bit about that theme as we go.
[112:57.88]Yeah, so, you know, a lot of the time was spent really just familiarizing myself with the game mechanics.
[113:03.30]But, you know, me and Connor were talking, not to throw Connor under the bus here, but we were trying to discuss what were the most important technological advancements.
[113:11.22]And so we were trying to make a timeline in our head, and we had Thomas Edison, and then we had the Ludwig subathon, and we didn't really have much else.
[113:20.51]Okay.
[113:20.79]So you're saying that there's Thomas Edison, lightbulb, and then Ludwig.
[113:26.06]Everything else in between.
[113:27.43]Nothing happened.
[113:28.85]There was some other stuff too.
[113:30.39]There was, for example, I don't know where Connor sourced this image.
[113:34.83]Which one?
[113:35.33]Which image?
[113:36.09]What the fuck is going on here?
[113:37.17]How did you get... How did you... How did you get George Bush drinking lead?
[113:42.94]Oh, well, it's simple.
[113:44.00]You go to an AI image generator and you put like 43rd president drinking purple drink out of two styrofoam cups.
[113:52.95]So we...
[113:55.49]Okay, alright, so I'm gonna keep going.
[113:58.03]Okay, but obviously in between that, there's Balloons Tower Defense 6, which is a huge landmark for gaming.
[114:04.45]We have the Cybertruck, which will revolutionize trucks.
[114:09.44]Yep.
[114:09.86]And then we have the RuneScape Grand Exchange, which kind of really invented the economy.
[114:16.70]There was no economy before.
[114:19.08]Okay.
[114:20.69]And then we have...
[114:24.10]Well, I don't know where I found that, but this was just an image that I found on Google pretty quickly.
[114:30.30]It was MrBeast, one of his videos where he's doing free candy.
[114:35.43]So what's going on up here?
[114:39.07]Well, you know, I felt like the house was kind of empty and I didn't really feel lived in.
[114:42.95]And so I wanted to make sure that there was a gaming area.
[114:48.88]Why did you build so much shit?
[114:51.94]Okay.
[114:52.32]Alright.
[114:53.10]So there's a gaming area and lots of, you've got a lot of jets here.
[114:56.88]Okay.
[114:57.42]And you've got, this is a gamer setup?
[114:59.74]He's a model jet enthusiast.
[115:02.88]I didn't know.
[115:03.46]That was all I could kind of figure out to build.
[115:07.59]Okay.
[115:09.52]So we can go check out the other tower.
[115:10.82]Oh my goodness.
[115:11.76]I just melted the world.
[115:12.42]I'm good.
[115:14.18]Okay.
[115:14.38]So here's the other tower.
[115:15.12]This is the other building.
[115:16.76]This one got a lot less love, but this one's theme was kind of, uh, it was kind of my favorite, my favorite things.
[115:25.71]These are obviously technological advancements too.
[115:28.59]Which are technological advancements.
[115:31.75]The connect.
[115:33.49]Well, yeah, the connect.
[115:36.29]Miku, that's, that's true.
[115:38.81]Yeah, it's Miku doing a concert.
[115:40.25]We have the Nintendo DS.
[115:41.91]We have the Kinect.
[115:43.47]If you go up, you'll see some more.
[115:45.21]Okay, you've got the Virtual Boy.
[115:46.55]We've got the... Is that another DS?
[115:50.20]No, that's the Nintendo Micro, which is a failed console, unfortunately.
[115:54.18]It didn't quite catch on.
[115:55.00]That's too bad.
[115:55.80]Only because people didn't want to...
[115:57.78]played like they were ants so you so you got you guys went with like a more of like a hey like the kind of the important technological advancements of our time which is mostly Nintendo consoles and Nintendo uh failed consoles yeah yeah it's not just Nintendo just happened to up a lot uh but that you know the connect is there the uh the gizmodo is there the uya wait where's the uya oh yeah
[116:24.25]I had an Ouya.
[116:25.17]What is that?
[116:25.53]I guess I didn't put it in.
[116:26.69]What is this one?
[116:28.01]A really good indie console.
[116:29.83]Which one?
[116:30.21]This one?
[116:31.36]Jetpack Joyride.
[116:32.96]That's the Nokia exclusive gaming phone, which was a huge flop.
[116:38.98]I think I have a grade for you guys.
[116:41.54]I don't know.
[116:42.04]Really?
[116:42.42]I don't know if you're going to like it.
[116:44.72]Well, you know, I think I turned up.
[116:49.57]You, this is, okay.
[116:51.51]I'm going to give you some points because you, you built, you built structure.
[116:58.37]Uh, although I'm going to, I'm going to take points away from that because you weren't supposed to.
[117:05.12]So you, so you gain points and you lost points.
[117:08.57]So, I have a grade for you here, and I'm rea- alright, we can chat in here too.
[117:13.28]Is it like two steps forward, one step back, or like one step forward, two steps back?
[117:16.68]I would say that's probably one step forward, and one and a half steps back.
[117:20.91]oh okay yeah that's alright that's fine that's fair that's fair alright so I am I'm fighting between because of the potential potential potential disqualification because of the building right but I would say I'm gonna have to give you guys
[117:40.46]That is a... It's either a C- or a D+, and I'm trying to figure out which one.
[117:47.33]Our names start with C. Your names do start with C. I'm going to go with C-.
[117:50.35]I'm going to give you a 71.
[117:55.59]Okay.
[117:56.01]And honestly, Miku saved you here.
[117:59.95]If Miku was not on this wall, that is a 68.
[118:01.71]It was a good call.
[118:03.84]It was a good call.
[118:05.42]I'll take it.
[118:05.80]I'll take it.
[118:06.20]That's fair.
[118:07.52]Chat gave you a C. Chat gave you a 75.
[118:10.66]My God, thank you.
[118:11.90]Thank you, chat.
[118:12.44]Thank you, chat.
[118:13.12]I really appreciate that.
[118:16.79]Alright.
[118:17.01]We need a... Thanks, C-Dog.
[118:18.79]Thanks, Connor.
[118:19.27]Just wait till our third house.
[118:21.09]You look really good out there, Connor.
[118:22.49]Nobody's talking about it.
[118:23.23]You look really good, both of you.
[118:24.35]Thanks, man.
[118:25.13]Thanks.
[118:25.45]Thank you.
[118:27.19]We both just woke up collectively.
[118:29.17]You both woke up.
[118:30.11]Okay.
[118:30.81]Very cool.
[118:31.15]Alright.
[118:31.71]Who's that?
[118:31.99]We got DougDoug.
[118:33.67]We got your... You're the second build for your team.
[118:36.27]Alright.
[118:37.57]Ready?
[118:39.26]I'm sorry.
[118:39.96]I should have muted.
[118:45.01]Damn it.
[118:48.25]I am putting it in.
[118:50.95]Give me ten.
[118:51.39]I'm sweating in this button up ass shirt.
[119:00.48]Alright.
[119:01.72]And you can see the screen share, right?
[119:03.64]Yeah.
[119:04.46]Perfect.
[119:07.38]and there you are I am going to close my eyes and run okay okay so I don't I have not I've not seen anything yeah you're you're good you're good you're facing the right way so let me fix my camera before you turn around let me give a little bit of background sure so ludwig and I put together some advanced technology did a little uh you know ai tech
[119:31.48]added it into the building.
[119:32.84]And I just want to let you know that 30 seconds before we exported, this thing stood up on its own and started moving away.
[119:39.89]No building, no changing happened on our part at all.
[119:43.29]It's the original house.
[119:44.13]It's just the technology, but go ahead.
[119:46.19]Okay.
[119:50.72]Oh, shit.
[119:53.88]We tried to keep it exactly like you first made it, Jerma, but sometimes technology gets away from you.
[119:59.17]Wow, that's fucking awesome.
[120:02.57]Alright, but then this is the... Exact same house as before.
[120:06.78]It's the same house.
[120:11.78]What?
[120:12.49]What actually powers the robot is...
[120:16.54]is a little bit of life, right?
[120:18.18]It's a meaningful symbolism, right?
[120:20.74]You can't fully make it a robot.
[120:22.08]It still needs to be powered by some kind of living being.
[120:24.74]And that's why that tree is the heart of it all.
[120:26.98]And it started with just one seed inside of him.
[120:29.72]Yeah.
[120:31.86]What?
[120:32.84]What's that?
[120:33.18]Is this what you mean?
[120:35.03]Right, right.
[120:35.43]If you look inside, think of it kind of like Wall-E, you know, where he protects that little seed.
[120:38.70]Same thing here.
[120:39.58]Oh, yeah.
[120:40.24]Okay.
[120:41.08]This is, okay.
[120:42.14]This is great.
[120:43.44]This is great.
[120:45.08]Let me get, I'm going to go out here.
[120:48.36]Are these washing machines?
[120:51.16]Advanced technological washing machines, yeah.
[120:55.45]These, like, fridges.
[120:58.45]And be sure to check out his nose.
[121:00.33]It is in theme.
[121:05.42]Oh, it's a carrot!
[121:08.81]You made like a... You made like a technologically advanced snowman.
[121:13.97]Merry Christmas, Jerma.
[121:15.53]Okay.
[121:16.27]So.
[121:17.61]Absolutely wonderful.
[121:19.27]Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.
[121:21.40]I do have to be fair to the last team.
[121:25.60]There was extra building here.
[121:27.86]You put a couple of walls up.
[121:30.22]But...
[121:32.68]Because I love the technologically advancement theme.
[121:35.70]I love the way that you guys work together on this.
[121:38.70]This is an A. This is somewhere in the A's.
[121:40.82]It just is.
[121:41.80]Because it has to be.
[121:43.38]There's no amount of points to deduct from this to make it not an A. But anyways.
[121:50.05]And Ben, you did keep the house.
[121:51.49]The house is the same house, right?
[121:53.37]Yep.
[121:53.75]Yep.
[121:54.09]Exactly the same.
[121:54.77]You just like moved it up.
[121:57.01]We didn't move it actually, no.
[121:58.23]It
[121:59.35]It was on the ground, and we logged out.
[122:00.85]Oh, yeah, and walked away.
[122:01.77]Okay.
[122:02.55]Stood up.
[122:03.71]We tried to change nothing here, but sometimes tech gets away from you.
[122:07.57]What's this?
[122:09.99]That's your voucher for entering the park.
[122:13.65]So, actually, I would pick that up before you leave, just so you don't litter.
[122:16.54]Uh, this is, this is, this is, this is an A. Yeah, this is high A. This is like an A. This is like a 90 something.
[122:24.23]This is like a 97, 96 or something.
[122:26.35]This is great.
[122:26.85]Uh, I'm going to say it's like a 90.
[122:33.17]And the story too, like the house just got up and walked away.
[122:37.79]But the, but the building, you added extra building parts.
[122:43.01]Okay.
[122:43.47]I'm going to give you a 90.
[122:48.01]I want to give you like a 98, but I can't.
[122:50.01]I got to give you a 93.
[122:50.75]What?
[122:52.11]Well, hold on.
[122:54.69]The extra building that was done is primarily appliances, right?
[122:59.12]The house itself, basically the same thing.
[123:02.32]We can give him a golden head.
[123:05.66]How'd you go from 97, 96?
[123:07.18]I want to give you 98 to 93.
[123:08.34]Where'd that number come from?
[123:09.92]I just want to know how'd you get there.
[123:12.11]Alright.
[123:13.11]I will give you a 96.
[123:17.15]But I need Ludwig to do a Marge Simpson impression.
[123:19.13]Are you getting bullied into raising the score?
[123:21.23]Is that a thing we can do now?
[123:23.43]Ludwig is willing to do whatever it takes to get that 96.
[123:26.16]I want to give you a 98, but I'm going to give you a 96.
[123:32.68]That was pretty good, actually.
[123:33.56]Yeah, you get 96.
[123:34.20]97, yeah.
[123:35.42]Alright.
[123:40.33]That is a 96 from me.
[123:41.81]What is chat?
[123:42.19]Should I give it a 95?
[123:44.33]Oh, damn.
[123:44.85]Alright.
[123:45.09]You guys, this is a good score.
[123:48.60]Great work.
[123:48.96]Thank you, Chef.
[123:49.70]Thank you very much, Chef.
[123:50.36]Thank you, Chef.
[123:50.66]That was beautiful.
[123:51.30]Thank you, Jerma.
[123:52.04]So you guys are, right now, you guys are at, you had 96 on this one, and then, Lud, you had... 89 from you, 88 total.
[124:01.69]Alright, so yeah, you guys are good.
[124:03.48]Very cool.
[124:05.49]alright let's get the next group we got uh team three build two we are I I don't want to speed run any of this but I do want to make a very important point there are a few people that need to be out of here in the next couple of hours the next like hour or two so I want to see how this is going to play out because we're about 25 minutes behind but I think it's where I think we're all good they're good plenty of time
[124:32.01]Alright.
[124:32.23]So let's get, let's get, uh, RT and Kiwa.
[124:34.83]Hello.
[124:35.57]Hello.
[124:36.11]Hello.
[124:36.55]Just a little bit of context, right?
[124:38.86]This room, it's an art piece.
[124:40.94]It's an exhibition piece, but there is also a little bit of context.
[124:44.64]So humanity as a whole.
[124:46.38]Wait, wait, hold on.
[124:46.98]I gotta get it open.
[124:47.86]I gotta get it open.
[124:48.74]Okay.
[124:49.10]Don't go in the room yet.
[124:50.18]You gotta wait outside.
[124:51.28]I definitely not want you to give your presentation without me being there.
[124:54.46]Okay.
[124:55.12]Thank you.
[124:56.86]This, this, let me just get it.
[124:58.75]Okay.
[125:00.99]Here is Kiwi.
[125:02.57]This is Kiwi, right?
[125:03.17]Mm-hmm.
[125:04.47]Okay.
[125:05.49]Alright.
[125:06.69]These have been great so far, honestly.
[125:08.21]Like, you guys have knocked it out of the park.
[125:10.20]The competition has been fierce.
[125:11.50]Like, it's pretty good across the board.
[125:13.50]I have no idea what's going to happen in the next, you know, hour and a half after we get through the next four or five of these, but I'm so ready.
[125:21.98]Alright.
[125:24.18]Opening it now, I will let you know when I'm ready.
[125:31.03]There you are.
[125:33.01]Okay.
[125:33.19]Jerva looks like he's buzzing.
[125:37.65]Let me just get this off the screen.
[125:38.89]Let me reset my cam because every time I open a project, it shuts my camera down.
[125:43.51]Very great technology.
[125:44.53]Speaking of technological advancements.
[125:49.00]And I'm almost ready.
[125:52.42]I am officially ready.
[125:53.40]Okay.
[125:54.16]We are ready.
[125:56.20]Brilliant.
[125:56.62]So like I said, it's an art piece, but a little bit of context.
[125:59.71]The world, well, humanity as a whole has gotten too greedy.
[126:02.89]Technological advancements, they're growing way too quickly.
[126:06.81]It's ended in nuclear warfare.
[126:08.43]The world has shattered.
[126:09.55]It's in pieces.
[126:10.35]This right here is the last beacon of hope.
[126:13.03]This building right here contains humanity's last weapon in an attempt to rebuild society.
[126:18.19]If you would like to enter.
[126:19.54]Holy shit.
[126:20.88]Alright, I'm ready.
[126:23.86]It's currently a work in progress as survivors have to travel from different islands to get to this location.
[126:29.64]But this is Brian, our beta resistance Yankee assistance Neo.
[126:33.90]Neo is Greek for new.
[126:36.11]He is here to build new America.
[126:38.25]That's my pitch.
[126:43.40]Okay.
[126:44.66]I love the technological advancement.
[126:46.72]I love how we're going with like kind of robots moving around.
[126:49.93]I will say you built this in the house.
[126:52.85]So that's very great.
[126:55.30]I love the robot.
[126:56.84]I think it's phenomenal.
[126:58.70]Can you go maybe a little bit what these TV screens are like is this?
[127:03.16]Well, it's more so because again Humanity has gone back to what would be the Dark Ages in our time.
[127:10.83]Well, it would be our time to Basically, so this is what they use to program for the robot.
[127:16.51]They still have touch screens.
[127:18.05]That's what the TVs are for they still have some technology, but most of it has been wiped out and
[127:23.41]I see.
[127:23.71]I see.
[127:24.93]And this is the frame here.
[127:27.18]This is a, is this a bookcase?
[127:32.50]I can't remember.
[127:33.48]I kept losing it, but it's all they had to work with.
[127:37.24]And I think it's going quite well for them.
[127:40.17]Alright.
[127:40.49]I like it.
[127:40.87]This is great.
[127:42.21]This is a wonderful job.
[127:43.27]I think it's, I think it's stellar.
[127:45.97]I, the only criticism that I have really, I've got maybe one is ceiling is bare.
[127:51.87]The brick.
[127:52.73]Well, see, that's the thing.
[127:54.60]They used the bookcase.
[127:56.34]They didn't have any ladders.
[127:57.26]They used the bookcase to actually, you know, build the body of the robot.
[128:01.28]They couldn't use it to replace the ceiling.
[128:04.18]I see.
[128:04.70]Okay.
[128:04.88]Okay.
[128:05.00]That's a good answer.
[128:08.72]I think this is, I think this is a pretty good B. I think this is a B. I'm going to give 80, 84.
[128:17.46]84, I think, is like a solid just B. I think it's great.
[128:22.01]Okay, thank you, Chef.
[128:23.11]What is Chakka going to give?
[128:24.09]Let's see.
[128:26.89]I think it's... You know, who is this guy?
[128:33.85]His name's Brian, the beta resistance, the assistance Neo.
[128:38.09]We like to just call him Brian.
[128:39.53]Okay.
[128:42.97]This picture.
[128:44.91]The house is kind of like a shelter but like in particular with the robot we really want to kind of emphasize this almost like a modern art sculpture as well.
[128:50.91]Mhm.
[128:51.91]Um kind of like something you would actually see in modern art galleries, there are numerous exhibits like this where it is kind of furniture almost mangled together in the similar vein.
[128:59.91]Like I even appreciate even the last robot build.
[129:03.00]Yeah.
[129:04.00]Granted we had a bit of a similar wavelength there, but it is actually quite common practice for these kind of metal sculptures to be in modern museums.
[129:13.01]I think it's solid.
[129:14.01]Chat, what is it?
[129:15.01]Chat is giving an 85.
[129:17.01]So we got- you guys- you guys have a pretty- what are you guys at 90? 84? 85?
[129:24.01]Yeah, you guys- you guys are right now at B.
[129:28.01]You guys are at- you can- if you get a good score in the next one this could be you guys could go up to like at least A.
[129:36.19]This is great.
[129:36.59]Well, thank you very much.
[129:38.59]No, I'm glad you like it, honestly.
[129:41.21]We're doing our best.
[129:41.99]Like, we're just having fun playing with the systems of the game more than anything.
[129:44.85]Yeah.
[129:45.21]It's new, and there's a lot of stuff to play with.
[129:47.40]And let me make it very clear again.
[129:48.74]This is all just for fun.
[129:50.36]Like, none of these grades even fucking mean anything.
[129:52.48]So, it's just for fun.
[129:53.86]But, I love it.
[129:54.44]Thank you, Kiwo.
[129:57.10]My parents are going to let me eat dinner tonight because my report card's not good enough.
[130:01.92]I'm going to go hungry.
[130:04.01]Alright, we got Joel coming up next.
[130:06.16]Joel Hawakee.
[130:06.78]Well, thank you.
[130:07.20]That was great.
[130:08.02]I love it.
[130:08.28]Alright, Joel and Vinny.
[130:14.94]Where are you?
[130:16.07]Hello.
[130:16.57]Hello, I'm here.
[130:17.15]What's up?
[130:20.21]So, I will say...
[130:24.15]We might have to... Okay, let's go over something really quick.
[130:29.14]So, before we do the next build, in about 20 minutes or so, we're going to have to have the first few people start a build.
[130:39.87]Not all of you, if you don't want to.
[130:41.57]But I think we're going to have to, because Northernlion, are you here?
[130:44.79]You're going to go in about an hour, right?
[130:48.64]yes but I think I can I'll start when you tell me to start and then I'll just hand it to squeaks like right when I have to go okay cool yeah and I've got the utmost faith in him I just want to make sure that I'm being courteous to your time so oh thank you yeah no everything's great I think we're okay if we we got maybe another 10 15 minutes probably 20 minutes so let's just get going alright this is uh this is Joel or this is Joel right
[131:16.45]should be I uploaded it twice and I have a story behind it but uh yes yeah I'm getting it right now opening importing I love this Joel house too well as I could call it do you ever play Joe's house Jerma I have not you really ought to check out Joe's house someday it's
[131:46.33]one of my favorite video games of all time.
[131:49.03]There you go.
[131:49.33]And it's in the house.
[131:50.15]You get a lot of enjoyment out of it, I think.
[131:52.73]Let me turn this off.
[131:55.41]I'm going to... Okay, here we go.
[131:56.77]So let me get outside.
[131:57.75]And can you see?
[132:01.56]Yes, yes, I can see.
[132:02.98]Okay, don't look too much.
[132:05.00]I'm going all the way around.
[132:06.00]I'm not looking.
[132:07.34]I'm just getting to a point where I can... Here we go.
[132:09.52]Okay.
[132:12.16]Extra building.
[132:13.38]Extra building.
[132:14.00]Alright.
[132:14.20]Are you guys ready?
[132:15.90]Yes.
[132:16.28]Okay.
[132:16.76]So first of all, I want to say this.
[132:18.76]Now, chat is judge, jury, and executioner here.
[132:22.72]And I will gladly take a hit for doing this.
[132:25.06]But I'll give you a quick story about this.
[132:26.80]Okay.
[132:27.28]I thought this event was tomorrow.
[132:30.08]And as I come home for the day, Jerma says, everybody ready?
[132:33.00]And I say, no, I don't even have the game yet.
[132:35.64]So I install it 10 minutes in.
[132:37.92]And Jerma's like, alright, here's how you do it.
[132:39.44]Here's how you do it.
[132:39.92]Okay.
[132:40.88]And I...
[132:42.49]I freak out and I'm like, I don't know how to do anything.
[132:45.05]So Jeremy was like, I do it.
[132:46.83]Okay.
[132:47.09]Anyway, my point is, um, so there was a glitch in the game and we talked about this beforehand, uh, custom images in this adds a Jason file, right?
[132:55.66]Like dot J S a O N. Now, when I exported this into the server, uh, the custom images did all work.
[133:03.19]So I had to upload it twice and I added a whole, um,
[133:07.86]in this map and now chat if you want to take points off I fully admit to it but it won't matter because this house sucks anyway okay so should I start I'm gonna start the front door okay so the the whole point of this was techn technological advancements right yep
[133:27.71]So, basically, I started off, I was talking to Vinny, like, what should we do here?
[133:31.82]I have an idea.
[133:32.36]Let's be cavemen about it.
[133:33.82]Let's build a house from scratch and see how technology has evolved.
[133:37.08]And I thought it was dinner-themed still, and then I realized it wasn't.
[133:40.49]So, I put cement down first, and then I realized it's not dinner-themed, but I put a plate in anyway.
[133:46.45]So, that doesn't matter.
[133:47.74]So, my point is...
[133:50.17]Went from building a cement shithouse into thinking, how has technology advanced?
[133:55.76]How is houses built in the future?
[133:57.92]And if you step outside, if you step outside, you will see what I mean.
[134:01.65]Another house.
[134:06.27]Ladies and gentlemen, Minecraft.
[134:08.85]The most technological behemoth of the 21st century is here in House Flipper.
[134:17.42]I like it.
[134:17.92]I like it.
[134:18.36]I like it.
[134:20.34]What is happening here?
[134:23.90]What is it?
[134:25.26]I need an explanation of what is going on in front of me right now.
[134:30.15]That's Steve.
[134:30.75]Uh-huh.
[134:32.27]That's Minecraft Steve.
[134:34.47]It's Minecraft Steve.
[134:35.77]Okay.
[134:38.75]Did you see the bed?
[134:41.70]What is going on here?
[134:43.94]That's Steve.
[134:45.25]What is going on?
[134:46.43]I know it's Steve, but what is happening to Steve?
[134:49.67]You play Minecraft.
[134:50.93]You did Jermacraft, and you don't recognize your own thing?
[134:53.31]Wait, what?
[134:57.65]What is... I believe it's Alfredo sauce.
[135:01.01]I'm not 100% sure.
[135:04.91]Listen, here's my rhetoric here, right?
[135:07.44]So the whole thing was cement.
[135:08.82]There's a bunch of cement everywhere because I was building everything.
[135:11.72]And with the cement that I was building, I was thinking, you know, cement gets hard and my brain gets harder too.
[135:18.77]So that's why I had to improvise a lot of this stuff.
[135:21.33]Now, if you look up, straight up.
[135:25.21]God damn it, dude.
[135:28.18]That's good.
[135:29.95]Okay, so that's a great house.
[135:33.60]I'm real happy to be on the ceiling.
[135:35.84]Yep.
[135:37.02]Let me just take one more look in here.
[135:38.36]So I love...
[135:45.13]Sorry.
[135:45.39]No, no, no, no, no.
[135:46.51]It's not done yet.
[135:47.51]Okay, I'm just going to say this.
[135:48.55]I'm just going to say this.
[135:49.89]Again, this is additional bullshit, and chat, deduct points if you want, because we had to configure some shit.
[135:54.96]But because the Minecraft thing was going on, I'm like, how else can I incorporate Minecraft into this?
[135:59.00]By the way, you missed my pickaxe inside the house, and I worked really hard on that.
[136:02.95]But my point is, outside...
[136:08.45]Outside, you'll find a hole.
[136:10.13]And I want to simulate the Minecraft experience.
[136:12.99]If you go around the place here, you'll find a hole.
[136:16.03]Oh, shit.
[136:17.25]It's a creeper.
[136:18.19]Oh.
[136:19.21]No, no, no, no.
[136:19.67]Not that hole.
[136:20.15]Not that hole.
[136:20.59]Not that hole.
[136:20.99]Not that hole.
[136:21.51]Which one?
[136:22.79]No, no, no, no.
[136:23.43]There's a hole.
[136:23.99]No, no.
[136:25.49]Don't look at that.
[136:26.29]It's the fine alley.
[136:28.14]No, no, no.
[136:28.76]There's a hole.
[136:29.28]No, no.
[136:30.02]Go back.
[136:30.34]No, no.
[136:30.62]Stop going that way.
[136:33.40]Why are you doing this wrong?
[136:35.42]I worked so badly on this.
[136:36.82]Alright.
[136:37.32]Where do I go?
[136:38.61]right look right 90 degrees okay so over here the mine sector so I didn't have time because I was I was uh trying to do Minecraft but I didn't realize I can't paint the word Minecraft so
[137:03.33]So anyway, around the whole area, uh, on the right side of the wall, there's, there's a clue.
[137:09.70]There's a little quiz.
[137:10.50]There's a quiz.
[137:12.62]Yeah.
[137:13.32]It's on the wall.
[137:13.98]Oh, okay.
[137:14.76]I see the quiz and the winner is follow the signs.
[137:20.12]It's behind the creeper.
[137:21.34]Okay.
[137:23.20]The winner is me.
[137:24.20]I win.
[137:25.31]You're the winner.
[137:30.73]I'm feeling like a winner myself right now, actually.
[137:32.83]Okay, this... I... Okay, let me be very, very honest.
[137:38.13]I love this.
[137:39.89]I love this house.
[137:42.57]But... It... I'm missing a little bit of the interior here.
[137:48.22]I'm missing a little bit of paint.
[137:51.30]I know you had the Minecraft theme, because that paint... Why would you have paint?
[137:54.28]It's wood.
[137:55.00]Makes complete sense.
[137:57.81]I love the story.
[137:58.61]I love the comedic timing.
[137:59.81]I love the comedy.
[138:01.33]It's... You don't have to lie to me.
[138:05.35]Jeremy, you don't have to lie to me.
[138:06.73]I like you.
[138:07.29]You can say it's dog shit.
[138:08.80]It's not, though.
[138:09.54]You don't have to lie.
[138:10.26]But it really isn't.
[138:11.16]No.
[138:11.56]No, it's dog shit.
[138:12.82]No, it really isn't.
[138:14.64]It's not a dog shit house.
[138:16.38]It's like the contrast of the advancement from caveman to digital caveman.
[138:20.97]That's true.
[138:21.47]You know?
[138:23.59]Yeah, it's very... It's artistic.
[138:26.81]Alright, I... I am gonna... I am gonna give... I'm gonna give... It's at least a C. At least a C. I think it's... I... Your story was so funny and, like, falling in the hole and it didn't... That's, like...
[138:51.40]Oh, this one's hard.
[138:52.52]I'm just going to say this.
[138:55.74]Depending on what score you give, it's going to radically change the ending of Vinny and I's collaborative effort.
[139:00.78]And Vinny doesn't even know about that yet.
[139:03.08]I'm going to give you an 80.
[139:03.70]Watch out.
[139:04.46]I'm going to give you an 80.
[139:05.90]It's okay.
[139:07.04]Can you make it 78 to the duck that I went over?
[139:09.70]It sucks.
[139:11.88]I'll give you 79.
[139:12.38]I'll give you 79.
[139:12.82]No, I don't think so.
[139:21.56]Hey, there is no last, by the way.
[139:22.94]Alright, what is chat going to give?
[139:29.71]Chat grade.
[139:38.07]Yes, there is.
[139:38.93]No, there's no... This is just for fun.
[139:40.43]It's not like... We're just fucking around.
[139:44.49]Joel, I think you're going to get a massive, massive score from chat.
[139:48.34]Like, I am... Oh, is it already here?
[139:52.99]Holy shit, chat gave you a 95.
[139:55.31]You got a 95.
[139:55.83]Take that score down, chat.
[139:58.37]Take that score down, okay?
[139:59.93]That brought you up to a B. Just because fucking Jeremy over here looks like a fucking Amish substitute teacher doesn't mean that we should feel pity for him.
[140:07.47]Calm down.
[140:08.53]Take that fucking score down.
[140:10.22]This house is crap, okay?
[140:12.62]Fuck this house.
[140:14.02]Nobody likes this house.
[140:15.24]Be honest, okay?
[140:17.52]I think you sold them on the story.
[140:19.28]I think that's what it was.
[140:19.86]Nope.
[140:22.33]But that was great.
[140:23.11]Thank you, Joel.
[140:24.37]Yeah, you guys are at 83 right now overall.
[140:26.65]Everybody's at like a B right now, which is exactly how what I was thinking was going to happen anyway.
[140:30.24]Alright.
[140:31.70]Next up.
[140:32.34]Thank you, Joel.
[140:32.86]We got Squeaks coming up here.
[140:34.48]Hello.
[140:35.38]Is my mic working?
[140:36.26]Can you hear me?
[140:39.10]I can hear you.
[140:40.04]I got the build.
[140:41.74]Let me just get it up.
[140:43.20]Get this off.
[140:43.94]Alright, close your eyes.
[140:44.74]It's very important.
[140:45.64]Yes, I'm going to just blow.
[140:47.06]I'm going to literally blow through.
[140:48.54]Actually, I'm going to do this too.
[140:52.66]I don't want I don't want anyone else to see either why not let's do that alright I got yours there you are no leaks I'm just sprinting through nobody I can't see anything and I'm at the front door okay so um back up for chat and let me reset the cam alright are you both in here uh we're gonna get uh some info from uh both of you or just
[141:19.72]yes I think uh I think it could be both of us if nl has some I'm ready to assist as necessary okay so so Jerma the prompt being technological advancement you know that's something that I think is continuous it's not a snapshot in time so what I wanted to represent was sort of a symbolic take on the prompt so go ahead and turn around okay
[141:41.69]and you're instantly struck with a strong metallic futuristic front.
[141:47.29]And now please feel free whenever you want to take a look around.
[141:51.29]Each symbol is representative of the advancement of humanity.
[141:55.88]The two pillars on one side, the monkey, one of our closest primates.
[142:01.34]Keep walking around.
[142:04.42]The brick stone wall for what is humanity without our elements and wielding them into a structure that we can abode in.
[142:12.31]Please continue.
[142:13.01]Okay.
[142:15.47]And finally, the flower representing a new life using our, you know, using the materials to blossom, if you will.
[142:23.55]Now go ahead and go to the entrance, please.
[142:25.39]Okay, excellent.
[142:28.40]Now, I want you to describe your emotion instantly.
[142:31.10]Uh, fear.
[142:33.30]Fear.
[142:34.59]That's exactly right, because the fear is the fear of the unknown and the future.
[142:39.07]I want to represent technology.
[142:40.63]If you look at the left-hand side, there's a fan.
[142:44.53]And what does fan technologically evolve into?
[142:48.35]An air conditioner.
[142:50.96]He's absolutely right.
[142:52.54]That's right.
[142:53.56]And if you look up, you can see that those are the three rings of light.
[142:57.90]That's just for lighting, Jerma, okay?
[142:59.26]I actually have no symbolism for that.
[143:01.06]Oh, this doesn't mean anything?
[143:02.26]No, that's just, that's aesthetic, but it means for the, you know, it actually means the light, how much light the technological improvements bring into our own life.
[143:09.77]You know what I mean?
[143:10.31]The three rings of light.
[143:11.89]I got you.
[143:12.37]I got you.
[143:12.93]Obviously.
[143:13.33]Come on, get real.
[143:14.95]You think that doesn't mean anything?
[143:16.39]What's going on here with the mushroom?
[143:18.59]The mushroom is basically the fruits of our labor.
[143:21.47]Like, man created AC, and that mushroom is enjoying the cool breeze created by work of mankind.
[143:29.84]Oh, okay.
[143:30.68]Very, very interesting.
[143:32.30]Thank you so much.
[143:32.92]I like the educational aspect of this one.
[143:34.44]This is educational.
[143:35.18]Alright, where should I go try?
[143:36.98]Now, if you go ahead and look straight.
[143:40.78]Now, you're going to see in front of you a rock right on the floor.
[143:45.91]Uh-huh.
[143:47.23]a brick right in the middle, and then on the right, the monolith from the 2001 Stanley Kubrick Space Odyssey.
[143:55.39]Okay.
[143:55.85]You've seen that film, haven't you?
[143:57.85]Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[143:59.58]So that's also an evolution of tools, which is essential for mankind and technological improvement.
[144:05.50]Wouldn't you agree?
[144:07.12]I would absolutely agree, yes.
[144:08.62]Thank you so much.
[144:09.94]And then up ahead, you can also see the three pillars, and this is supposed to be representative of heaven.
[144:17.12]Oh, okay.
[144:17.58]Or the afterlife.
[144:19.10]The yin and the yang.
[144:20.72]You know, the heaven and hell.
[144:24.34]Now there's a speaker system as well because, you know, who doesn't love some Jason Mraz or something, you know?
[144:29.08]Right, of course.
[144:30.60]Get real.
[144:32.61]Okay, now go ahead and turn to the right for the final wall.
[144:36.53]Oh, right to the right?
[144:37.77]Yes.
[144:38.71]Similar situation.
[144:40.35]Old school CRT melee tournament monitor.
[144:44.17]Evolving.
[144:46.22]Into a OLED Sony 76-inch TV.
[144:52.06]That's technology, Jerma.
[144:53.82]That is at most 30 inches.
[144:57.56]Well, you know, it depends how big the human is.
[145:00.20]Everything is smaller in the future.
[145:01.69]That's right.
[145:02.85]Thank you.
[145:03.71]Thank you so much.
[145:04.41]I like it.
[145:05.05]That's right.
[145:05.71]Saved.
[145:06.47]This is great.
[145:07.91]I love the look we're advancing here.
[145:09.65]This is fantastic.
[145:10.95]I love it.
[145:12.27]Thank you so much.
[145:12.91]What is going on here?
[145:14.61]What is this?
[145:15.17]So that's supposed to represent ashes, you know, because this is supposed to be like the heaven and hell.
[145:20.16]And a lot of people believe in like, you know, burning a body afterwards.
[145:23.20]So I want to give them representation.
[145:24.92]I think representation is very important when we're talking about humanity.
[145:29.22]And this I'm imagining is cars are now huge.
[145:33.38]Yes, because as Western civilization has progressed, you know, cars have become bigger and bigger.
[145:38.76]And that's just sort of a that's sort of like a clean energy statement, if you will.
[145:41.78]You know, I hate getting political.
[145:43.70]Yeah, so I thought this was that in the future, cars were going to be like as big as houses.
[145:49.02]Well, maybe that is.
[145:49.85]You know, we haven't, we're never really in the future, Jerma.
[145:52.53]The future is always tomorrow.
[145:53.67]So who knows?
[145:54.55]What about this?
[145:55.89]That's a flower.
[145:57.39]Nice.
[145:57.87]Alright.
[145:58.87]That was great.
[146:00.05]I would say that was a fantastic presentation.
[146:04.08]Presentation-wise, you were at an A+.
[146:06.38]Presentation-wise, A+.
[146:09.30]I think... Oh, wait, Jerma, can I actually add one more thing?
[146:11.78]I forgot to tell you.
[146:12.60]Sure.
[146:13.68]Homie?
[146:15.02]Homie, is that you?
[146:17.15]Homie?
[146:18.37]Sal, go ahead.
[146:19.21]Continue.
[146:19.65]Who was that?
[146:21.77]That was Marge Simpson.
[146:23.35]Oh, that was... Oh, I was... Are you kidding me?
[146:25.51]For a second, I forgot... I've been practicing.
[146:27.17]I saw a YouTube video about how to do it.
[146:29.54]That was... Okay, so that was for two points.
[146:32.24]If you did a Marge Simpson impression, I'm going to remove one point.
[146:34.96]Okay.
[146:35.60]Because that was just... It was just awful.
[146:37.99]Can I say one more thing?
[146:40.61]There was a little bit of intentionality with the design here, if you back up and look at the exterior of the piece.
[146:46.57]Okay.
[146:47.73]There's trim around the roof, and we wanted to evoke the idea of a checkered flag, because where they use checkered flags, they use it at the end of races.
[147:00.91]Is it possible that our technological advancement could be the end of the human race, or
[147:07.38]Is this the starting line?
[147:08.78]Just something to think about while you peruse the exhibit.
[147:12.12]Wow.
[147:13.78]Wow.
[147:14.98]Wow.
[147:16.72]That's right.
[147:18.81]Okay, I know what chat's grade is, and I'm up there too.
[147:23.51]That presentation-wise was... It kind of changed my life a little.
[147:32.09]I think that I'm going to have to give you...
[147:35.78]Yeah, chat gave you a 95, which is... I'm floating around somewhere between 90 and 95.
[147:39.52]Perfect.
[147:49.45]That presentation was awesome.
[147:50.55]I'm going to go 95.
[147:54.47]I'm just going 95.
[147:54.89]Thank you, sir.
[147:55.27]95, 95.
[147:55.69]You guys are at a 95 right now.
[147:58.03]Big.
[147:58.19]Perfect.
[148:05.85]Alright, well, thanks, Squeaks.
[148:07.22]That was great.
[148:08.12]I love the story.
[148:10.02]I love the theme that you followed.
[148:11.54]I love the kind of, like, advancements and where we began, where we started, where do we end.
[148:14.82]Do we begin?
[148:15.28]Are we going to begin again?
[148:16.04]Are we going to end?
[148:16.60]I liked it a lot.
[148:20.82]Yeah, that was great.
[148:21.80]Thank you, Northernlion and Squeaks, for another great presentation.
[148:25.33]Alright, let's get S-Fan and Bonnie in here.
[148:28.35]Alright, S-Fan and Bonnie, what do you got?
[148:30.13]Let's see.
[148:31.23]We got any technologically advanced things?
[148:33.95]No, no, no.
[148:34.51]Well...
[148:35.63]We do.
[148:35.95]Yeah, so Squeaks and Northern are actually the mafia and they actually stole our idea, so.
[148:47.14]Yes, they stole all of our stuff out of that last house as well.
[148:50.20]Oh, also the file to drop, just drop the zip.
[148:54.62]You don't have to like open it or extract it.
[148:56.00]Just like that full zip file.
[148:57.08]We don't even know how to export the file.
[148:58.48]Are you kidding me, Bonnie?
[148:59.42]I don't know how to export.
[149:01.10]I don't know how to export a file.
[149:02.58]I'm a streamer.
[149:03.56]Did you export it yet?
[149:05.64]Oh, yeah.
[149:06.56]Let me just... One moment, please.
[149:09.46]I think what happened is you opened the zip and put what was in there here.
[149:14.30]The zip is all... Right.
[149:21.13]So... That was incredibly embarrassing.
[149:26.55]Yeah, I just need the zip.
[149:28.37]Okay.
[149:30.95]Let me just... So... Okay.
[149:33.81]Okay.
[149:37.12]The zip.
[149:39.66]Do you know what a zip is?
[149:45.04]Are you in the game right now?
[149:46.00]Are you in the build?
[149:47.40]I have the file folder.
[149:48.86]Yeah, I can.
[149:50.63]Yeah, here.
[149:51.13]Let me get into the build right now.
[149:53.55]One second.
[149:54.59]And then when you get in there, hit tab.
[149:56.13]Okay.
[149:57.45]And you can go.
[149:58.45]Okay.
[150:00.37]Okay.
[150:02.17]I'm getting in there.
[150:03.67]And do I have to, I have to go into the game, into the, sorry, into the build, right?
[150:07.61]Yep.
[150:08.29]So when you get in the build, you'll be just in the sandbox mode and edit mode and everything.
[150:13.90]You'll be able to go to hit tab.
[150:16.24]And then at the top, there's store and property settings, property settings.
[150:19.74]And then bottom right is export as mod.
[150:23.90]And that's going to open a file.
[150:25.09]That's going to be like a file explorer.
[150:26.67]So it's going to be like, oh, here you go.
[150:27.73]Here it is.
[150:28.23]It's going to be like an HF2, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[150:30.85]That is the only thing I need.
[150:32.68]Okay.
[150:34.02]So it's loading right now.
[150:35.18]Sorry.
[150:35.40]I had to restart it.
[150:36.74]No, you're good.
[150:37.22]Don't worry.
[150:37.50]Okay.
[150:38.44]It's all good.
[150:40.72]And okay.
[150:41.34]So I'm in, I'm in sandbox mode.
[150:43.58]I go to the folder that it's in.
[150:45.46]I see the, the build.
[150:47.97]Yep.
[150:48.17]So I right clicked it.
[150:52.31]Guess that file.
[150:54.05]So when you hit export as mod, it's just like, boom, here it is.
[150:57.90]It's a zip file.
[150:58.68]It's HF2, blah, blah, blah.
[151:00.78]Just take that file and just drag it over here into basement uploads.
[151:05.26]Okay.
[151:06.10]Because it doesn't say export as mod, but I'm also redacted.
[151:11.23]So I'm looking for, I'm going to try to do, should I, it says open in file explorer.
[151:18.47]Should I open in file explorer?
[151:19.97]Sure.
[151:20.88]Oh, I, I think if so, when you click export as mod, what happens?
[151:25.06]When you like click that button?
[151:26.82]There is no export as mod.
[151:29.14]Are you are you walking around the build right now?
[151:31.83]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.
[151:34.13]Okay, sorry.
[151:35.03]I realized what's going on here.
[151:36.53]Sorry.
[151:38.27]Don't worry.
[151:38.79]Don't worry.
[151:40.67]Okay.
[151:41.71]Um, tab export.
[151:43.21]Go here.
[151:44.89]There you go.
[151:48.30]I'm here for tech support.
[151:50.36]I'm here for this.
[151:51.44]This is why I'm here.
[152:01.43]We're at 2 hours and 30 minutes.
[152:02.67]Oh, we're good!
[152:04.51]We're good!
[152:11.37]You dressed like tech support?
[152:12.59]Yeah.
[152:16.38]Yeah, and when you do export, if you drop it over there, then the mods can help you with where to put it.
[152:28.07]So what we'll probably do is, Bonnie, I'll take Ster and poke right now, and then we'll go back to you guys right after.
[152:34.77]Can I sit down?
[152:35.25]Wait, yeah, here.
[152:36.33]Okay, Esfand has a question.
[152:39.02]Okay.
[152:39.36]Ask away.
[152:45.68]Wait, so normally whenever you hit tab, doesn't it have mods at the top?
[152:51.58]Like store then mods and then you export?
[152:53.48]Yeah, so you've got to be in the actual game, like in this board.
[152:57.18]Yeah, hers doesn't have that for some reason.
[152:59.06]Really?
[153:00.10]Are you in play mode or edit mode?
[153:03.28]I don't know.
[153:03.78]Let me see.
[153:04.02]I'm going to restart it.
[153:09.39]So...
[153:11.70]because when you open it there's a choice to do play mode or edit mode and it I think play mode makes it so you're like playing the game edit mode gives you that like tab with like the okay here's like the yeah oh yeah yeah okay I got it weird let's go got it nice sorry I feel bad I'm sorry no you're fine don't worry we're just we're just chilling
[153:41.26]We are just chillin'.
[153:42.14]Dammit.
[153:45.55]We get to look around Squeaks' house a little more.
[153:49.51]Cool.
[153:49.63]Alright.
[153:50.03]Okay.
[153:53.01]Okay, there we go.
[153:57.15]Hopefully that works.
[153:59.52]Hey, there it is.
[154:00.34]Perfect.
[154:00.94]Yay, sorry about that.
[154:02.56]No, you're good.
[154:03.20]This is perfect.
[154:04.26]Okay.
[154:04.50]Let me open this up.
[154:07.70]Go like this.
[154:13.84]Load, load, load, load, load.
[154:15.26]There we go.
[154:21.15]I am going to make it so chat cannot see.
[154:25.11]And I'm not going to look either.
[154:26.23]Because I don't want to spoil chat.
[154:32.90]God, where are we here?
[154:37.42]There you go.
[154:39.84]I'm not going to look.
[154:43.13]he's not looking and let me get this back on let me get this cam fixed because it stinks and alright alright bonnie how are you hi I'm doing great how are you I'm doing good
[155:04.27]okay so you know aside from you know northern and squeaks being the mafia and robbing our last build and stealing this idea um so we can just get whoa what how this is like a this is the void the house actually this is that's where the other employees
[155:29.61]Oh, wow.
[155:30.89]This is cool.
[155:32.45]I like this.
[155:33.39]So this is our Museum of Technology of Mankind.
[155:38.23]And this is the futuristic technology museum.
[155:42.19]And its name is Return to the Sea.
[155:44.55]So as you can see, we've decorated it with monkeys to symbolize humanity, something that Squeaks and Northern all robbed from us.
[155:56.72]It's a smart play.
[155:58.10]It's a smart idea.
[155:59.74]Yes, so as you can see, if you walk into this glorious museum, you'll immediately notice that... Thank you for closing the door, by the way.
[156:10.75]The air gets let out.
[156:12.63]It's really expensive, the AC.
[156:15.06]Yeah, so we've got a display here.
[156:17.78]So this is actually the middle.
[156:19.42]So if you go over straight across... So just straight over here?
[156:24.02]Where that rock is.
[156:25.90]and you just turn to your right and there it is.
[156:28.10]This is the beginning, the beginning of all humankind, beginning from the rock, our very first tool.
[156:37.54]And then, as you can see, we moved on to fire.
[156:41.34]Humans invented fire.
[156:43.86]Unfortunately, we couldn't figure out the fire, but the candle could have fire on it.
[156:48.92]It's symbolizing fire.
[156:50.18]Yes.
[156:54.54]And then we moved on to our first tools.
[156:57.68]So that's what the toolbox symbolizes.
[157:00.50]We don't know if it's a toolbox or a tackle box for fishing, but let's just imagine.
[157:05.14]And here we have the wheels.
[157:09.32]We invented the wheels.
[157:10.96]Okay.
[157:11.32]Oh, cool.
[157:11.52]Alright.
[157:12.10]I like it.
[157:12.50]Which also caused a lot of accidents.
[157:14.52]So that's why that's there.
[157:17.00]And then metal, right?
[157:21.36]Yeah.
[157:22.07]Well, this was iron.
[157:23.63]Yeah, that's iron, which you pump, you know, and that's the thing, discovering different types of metals, you know, as we're going on through the technological advancements of time.
[157:33.09]Sure.
[157:33.77]You know, they discover these different materials.
[157:35.43]Obviously, we started with rock and you saw the wood actually at the beginning with the tree stump.
[157:40.08]um oh the wood yep yeah so we had that as well and then and then we move on to electricity interesting uh invented electricity yeah which we skipped a couple years here but we knew you were gonna be short on time you know because
[157:58.20]We were trying to consolidate things.
[157:59.98]We were trying to keep it as brief as possible for you.
[158:02.40]That's why we came so well prepared.
[158:04.05]These are warm-up builds.
[158:04.99]You guys got some experience now.
[158:11.17]If you zoom in, you'll notice a train.
[158:14.63]Yeah, the train.
[158:16.14]Oh, it is a little train.
[158:17.26]And next to that is a... The steam engine.
[158:22.97]That was the steam engine.
[158:25.99]It's crazy that they actually had a steam engine in House Slipper 2.
[158:29.69]And that's just really like what this game brings to the table.
[158:32.05]It's actually incredible.
[158:33.21]And as we continue on our tour, we start becoming more technologically advanced.
[158:39.05]And as you can see here, we have the airplane and the car and a satellite dish.
[158:47.62]The satellite dish is for internet.
[158:50.03]The beginning of the internet and AI.
[158:53.17]And so as we continue on, if you continue on, you will notice that there is a telephone here that you can use to call for help if you ever need it.
[159:02.24]This is another invention.
[159:04.80]And if you continue on, you will notice.
[159:07.81]I love how your voice has changed.
[159:13.85]Wait, the toaster?
[159:14.53]My voice didn't change.
[159:15.59]This is just my regular voice.
[159:17.30]Okay.
[159:18.36]So, then we have the toaster.
[159:19.40]The toaster is in front of the internet.
[159:24.53]Well, this is a better toaster than the one that was made before the internet.
[159:29.59]Oh, okay.
[159:30.43]This toaster is Wi-Fi enabled.
[159:32.65]This is to symbolize the invention of sliced bread.
[159:39.71]Which only happened after the internet.
[159:42.47]Mm-hmm.
[159:43.19]That is true.
[159:44.83]Toasted bread didn't even, it wasn't even a thing until, like, at least, like, 2010.
[159:47.97]Not with Wi-Fi.
[159:49.37]Yeah.
[159:50.43]Not with Wi-Fi.
[159:51.42]But the bread having Wi-Fi in it is, like, that's coming soon, probably so.
[159:54.68]Yeah.
[159:55.36]Well, that happened with, you know, the 5G.
[159:57.70]Alright, so this is an iPad?
[160:01.12]Yeah, it's a laptop, actually.
[160:03.66]And a cell phone.
[160:08.14]and a microwave and then the future.
[160:11.80]Yeah, let's talk about this a little bit.
[160:13.71]This is life.
[160:16.21]The next thing that you can see here, this actually symbolizes the future.
[160:19.09]This is something that we haven't experienced yet in our current timeline.
[160:23.22]And then this here is where we come back
[160:26.17]from AI and humanity, we become human again, and we actually devolve back to our former state, the fish, and we return to the sea, which I believe that all of humanity will eventually do, fulfilling our prophecy of returning from AI to the sea.
[160:44.04]And this is the sea.
[160:45.92]Yes.
[160:46.30]And this is... I like how the lobsters are going into the water.
[160:53.62]No, this symbolizes the death of humanity.
[160:56.57]Oh, shit.
[160:58.57]And the beginning of something new, which is our life returning to the sea.
[161:04.71]So that's pretty much the extent of this.
[161:10.50]So this is technological advancement in an easy exhibit.
[161:15.60]Easy to view.
[161:17.20]We hope you enjoyed your tour.
[161:19.42]So the Squeaks and Northernlion version was not necessarily a museum as much as it was a sort of a... This is like every stage of humanity.
[161:28.70]Oh my God, I just punched the microphone.
[161:31.00]I'm so sorry.
[161:31.38]This is every stage of humanity.
[161:33.84]Yes.
[161:35.10]This is our history.
[161:37.46]This is everything.
[161:38.32]This is everything that we have been, everything that we are, and everything that we will be.
[161:42.24]And as you can see, it's a bunch of junk, but it's beautiful.
[161:45.98]all cluttered together.
[161:47.20]And the ending of returning to the sea is the main portion here that we've incorporated with the environment.
[161:56.52]Yeah, I like the ending here.
[161:57.84]I like returning to the void.
[162:00.11]It's nice.
[162:01.89]Alright, I think I know what I'm going to give you.
[162:04.13]I think you guys got some pretty good warm-up rounds.
[162:05.73]I'm actually really looking forward to see what you guys do for the real build, the 90-minute let's go hype build.
[162:13.59]Well, yes, because we've never played before, so we've learned a lot in these two sessions.
[162:17.85]Yeah, keep in mind, Esfand and Bonnie didn't even play the game until about an hour and 12 minutes ago.
[162:23.01]Like, two hours ago.
[162:23.69]So, for not knowing anything, this is great.
[162:26.64]Thank you.
[162:28.10]I am going to give you... I'm going to give you... I'll give you... You know, I'm going to give you a solid... You know, I like the story.
[162:35.42]I'm going to give you a C. I'm going to give you a C. You will regret that.
[162:40.07]I probably will.
[162:41.57]It should be a D, but thank you.
[162:43.23]Well, I think that... Well, Squeaks and... And I'm very grateful for this, obviously, sir, your graciousness.
[162:50.95]But Squeaks and Northern did get an A, and they weren't even a museum, and their shit didn't really make... And they stole our wallpaper.
[162:58.26]And so... Did they actually steal it?
[163:00.60]Did they come in and say, hey, I know what you're doing?
[163:03.50]Probably.
[163:03.94]Because they could have taken it while we weren't looking.
[163:07.73]Well, regardless of any thievery, this is the second time you've been robbed.
[163:11.03]That's kind of ridiculous.
[163:12.99]Uh, I'll give you, I'm gonna give you a 70.
[163:15.37]I'm gonna give you a 70.
[163:15.97]I'm gonna give you a C minus.
[163:18.38]Oh.
[163:19.62]Hey, this is only, these are only 10% of your grade.
[163:22.74]Everything's fine.
[163:23.30]Don't worry.
[163:24.20]Sick.
[163:24.68]Okay, cool.
[163:25.52]Thank you.
[163:28.08]Very much appreciated.
[163:29.24]Can I get a Mark Simpson for two extra points?
[163:32.57]Uh...
[163:36.03]Oh, homie!
[163:37.97]We need to get braces for Lisa!
[163:40.37]Yes!
[163:41.50]Please, give us new braces!
[163:43.30]Bonnie, that is an old woman.
[163:45.06]I'm gonna keep it at 70.
[163:46.74]No, I'll give you 71.
[163:49.16]I'll give you 71.
[163:50.08]71.
[163:50.26]71.
[163:50.32]Oh, 72 too.
[163:53.86]You got an 85 from chat.
[163:55.31]You guys got a B from chat.
[163:56.41]You guys are at 75 total grade.
[163:58.89]Chat's a bunch of crackheads.
[164:00.25]That should have been, after our voices, that should have been about a 64.
[164:04.76]That was really bad.
[164:07.02]Alright, thank you, Esfand and Bonnie.
[164:09.58]Appreciate it.
[164:11.43]We'll get you in the next one.
[164:12.47]We'll see what you guys come up with for the final build.
[164:14.73]We are moving right along.
[164:15.71]Only three more before we do the big build.
[164:18.39]And I do feel bad that Northernlion... Here's what we're gonna do.
[164:24.39]Northernlion has to leave in, like, 20 minutes.
[164:27.43]So, what I would like to do is I would like to have the mods, if you could.
[164:33.14]If you could.
[164:35.14]Have Northernlion and Squeaks start their build.
[164:39.84]Have Northernlion start building with whatever they were going to do.
[164:44.11]So he gets about 20, 30 minutes to build.
[164:47.77]So I think that makes sense.
[164:49.63]And then when after, because he's going to have to go in like 20 minutes, 15 minutes.
[164:53.88]So I really want Northernlion to have like some contribution to that.
[164:57.00]So mods, can we get a time, a timer for Anel?
[165:02.55]That would be amazing.
[165:03.98]And whatever time he had.
[165:05.22]Because then what we can do is we can have just Squeaks go for the rest.
[165:10.26]Alright, Ster, poke.
[165:11.85]So yeah, so Squeaks and NL start to think now because Northernlion, you should start building now.
[165:18.79]And just keep track of the time.
[165:20.79]Alright, I do need to know what to build and where, but I know you might not want to say it on open mic because it will spoil the surprise a little.
[165:29.84]I can say it right now.
[165:32.04]Total complete creative freedom.
[165:35.02]You can do whatever you want.
[165:37.68]You have 90 minutes to do it.
[165:40.02]Anything you want, just follow TOS.
[165:44.46]There's complete freedom.
[165:46.06]You're going to build it on the large lot.
[165:49.43]Not the medium one.
[165:50.25]Let me just give you a quick little rundown.
[165:53.41]So you are going to do new property.
[165:55.77]So if you go to, let me make sure you can see if you're looking at my stream.
[166:01.24]New property.
[166:03.04]Large.
[166:04.76]And name it whatever you want.
[166:05.74]You're doing the large property.
[166:07.60]And can we choose any environment?
[166:08.92]You can choose anything you want.
[166:10.22]It is completely up to you.
[166:11.70]You have 90 minutes.
[166:13.10]Just squeaks whatever he has left.
[166:15.78]Whether it's like 70 minutes or 80 minutes, that's what you're going to do.
[166:18.80]Okay.
[166:19.08]And that's why he's doing it alone.
[166:20.62]And then I import it, right?
[166:22.37]Yes.
[166:22.63]So whatever he has, he'll send it to you.
[166:24.77]Alright.
[166:25.13]Awesome.
[166:25.45]That sounds good to me.
[166:26.01]Alright.
[166:27.13]Good luck.
[166:27.99]It was great to see you.
[166:29.33]Thanks for coming.
[166:29.89]Thanks, obviously.
[166:30.41]Thank you.
[166:30.91]Thank you.
[166:31.23]Sorry to everybody.
[166:31.97]I have to leave early.
[166:32.75]But if I don't go to the daycare on time, they're going to throw me in Supermax prison.
[166:37.39]Very good reason to leave.
[166:38.63]Alright.
[166:39.71]Thanks, dude.
[166:40.17]We'll see you soon.
[166:42.58]Alright.
[166:43.00]Poke.
[166:43.68]Ster.
[166:46.32]Hello.
[166:47.02]Okay.
[166:48.06]I am ready to put yours in.
[166:50.66]Let's go for this.
[166:52.56]Put me in, champ.
[166:53.68]I'm going to turn this off.
[166:56.64]So I don't want to spoil it.
[167:01.81]A little bit classic non-spoiler.
[167:03.25]Hello.
[167:03.55]So this is your build.
[167:06.23]Yes.
[167:06.67]With technological advancement.
[167:08.91]Okay.
[167:12.09]I got to import it.
[167:14.66]You might have the wrong version.
[167:15.59]It's final two.
[167:17.13]Final two.
[167:17.59]Fine.
[167:17.95]Underscore final.
[167:18.79]Underscore finale.
[167:19.99]Is the one you put in 15 minutes ago?
[167:22.33]20 minutes ago?
[167:22.63]Yeah.
[167:22.77]Alright, cool.
[167:26.21]I see it.
[167:29.36]Yep.
[167:30.02]I see... Where is it?
[167:34.48]Bottom left.
[167:35.24]It was on the bottom.
[167:37.82]Bottom second.
[167:38.83]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[167:41.29]Woo!
[167:41.41]Woo!
[167:42.46]Alright, I am turned around.
[167:43.80]My chat can now see.
[167:45.50]I'm going to reset the cam.
[167:47.90]Because why not?
[167:56.52]Okay.
[167:58.32]I am ready when you are.
[167:59.34]You good?
[168:00.49]Yeah, yeah.
[168:01.45]So I wanted to take the idea and do a little bit different because the theme is technology.
[168:06.92]And it was my thought that the more advanced technology gets, the more we want to retreat from it.
[168:13.90]You know, you're on Twitter all day.
[168:15.02]You see Elon Musk.
[168:16.20]Someone's talking about AI and people using AI in their house flippers and they're not getting points deducted for it, even though that's kind of like cheating and using, you know what I'm talking about?
[168:24.25]So I made a classic...
[168:27.44]witch's hut if you turn around and take a take a breath of the scenery as we all return to paganism and the old ways and we depart from technology what the fuck dude okay alright so this is a departure from technological advancements
[168:44.97]Yes, absolutely.
[168:47.15]Because once technology becomes too in your face, you really need to retreat.
[168:50.89]Go live in the woods and find your own way.
[168:53.39]And before you open the door, as you walk up to the main entrance, you hear from inside, Oh, homie, welcome home.
[169:01.99]Oh.
[169:03.85]Hulk, were you just about to do it?
[169:06.37]No, I hurt my toe.
[169:07.15]What?
[169:07.83]Oh, homie.
[169:15.30]He tried.
[169:15.74]I'll consider giving you the points.
[169:18.47]I'm thinking about it.
[169:20.33]Mine was good.
[169:22.97]Little teammate.
[169:25.61]You know.
[169:26.01]Okay.
[169:26.53]I'm in the front.
[169:29.01]Alright.
[169:29.29]Well, as we enter the home, we find that as we retreat from technology, we realize we actually just wanted it the whole time and we really just want to be alone with it.
[169:38.04]We have our gamer den and all our pizza boxes we've had delivered sort of
[169:43.66]are all over the place.
[169:44.52]Our soda cans left.
[169:47.50]So it's a retreat from technology, but not at all.
[169:51.50]You actually really can't retreat from technology.
[169:53.92]Once you get out here, the 5G actually reaches here.
[169:56.06]You look at your phone, you still have Uber Eats.
[169:58.06]You still got all this stuff.
[170:00.14]You're really just, you're stuck.
[170:02.40]The Wi-Fi reaches.
[170:03.96]You may notice on the desk, we have about 30 copies of Final Fantasy.
[170:09.49]Because...
[170:12.98]yeah we realized there was like a refer our friend system and we had to just keep like like referring friends but we don't have friends so we had to buy the copies ourselves because we're alone we're a hermit in the woods so there's little workarounds you can do for like the oddities of technology and you can find your own way very cool I see I see a I see a miku up here
[170:33.60]What's wrong with Miku?
[170:35.22]That gets you points.
[170:37.06]Oh, oh, good.
[170:37.62]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[170:38.40]I thought you were a Miku hater.
[170:39.74]No, no, no.
[170:40.38]I was misunderstanding.
[170:41.50]I have to really say this because people are just going to put fucking Miku pictures everywhere in the actual big build.
[170:48.43]I'm going to retract that statement.
[170:50.37]If you put Miku in, if you have like a Miku room, don't even, don't, don't you dare.
[170:54.89]Because now people are going to be like, oh, I'm going to get extra points if I do Miku.
[170:58.63]Don't do that.
[170:59.90]Yeah, everyone loves a good hobbit hole.
[171:02.85]Alright, this is great.
[171:05.59]What's going on here?
[171:08.05]That's a little bit of my fursona.
[171:09.71]I figure the witch has one at this point because we're in the future.
[171:12.26]Before they retreated into seclusion, they did have to become a furry for the tax credits.
[171:18.06]Okay.
[171:20.46]And I know there's something you're going to like.
[171:23.06]There's a little bug next to the keyboard.
[171:24.94]On the left of the keyboard, there's a little bug there.
[171:27.90]This is a bug-friendly house.
[171:29.16]It's hard to see.
[171:29.76]It's a tiny little buggy back there behind all the stacks of Final Fantasy.
[171:33.40]Whoa!
[171:35.28]There's a little bug.
[171:35.98]That's cool.
[171:38.27]Alright.
[171:40.05]Here are my thoughts.
[171:41.29]Thought number one.
[171:42.57]The outside is absolutely stunning.
[171:45.41]Like, this is a 100.
[171:45.89]Thank you.
[171:47.35]Thank you.
[171:48.31]This is probably one of the better outsides that we have seen so far.
[171:53.58]This is a 100 for the outside.
[171:56.91]I really like what you're doing in here.
[171:58.59]Fuck yeah.
[171:59.53]Sorry.
[172:03.47]I love what you're doing in here, but I would have liked to see just a little bit more maybe furniture.
[172:13.40]I'll tell you the truth.
[172:14.80]A lot of people give me the bullshit all day.
[172:16.86]There was so many dirt on the ground, I couldn't place a mattress in the last final minute.
[172:23.74]You couldn't?
[172:25.04]It didn't fit.
[172:26.39]So I think all you really need is the game, if I'm honest.
[172:31.01]If I have to back it up, you only need the game.
[172:33.71]What else you can do?
[172:34.51]You got Final Fantasy.
[172:36.33]Yeah.
[172:36.97]Anything else on the other side?
[172:38.01]This looks like you did sculpting of the land.
[172:41.57]That's yeah.
[172:42.49]Yeah, that's.
[172:44.88]I mean, that's just like the highest I can give you out here.
[172:46.88]I think I really like the inside.
[172:49.14]I like how they kind of retract, but then we're not actually retracting from technology.
[172:52.67]We can't get away from it.
[172:54.09]Yep.
[172:54.43]That's a great story.
[172:55.73]I think it's a statement, really.
[172:58.73]Try as you might.
[173:00.25]I think, so Chad has given you a grade right now.
[173:02.15]I will give you mine too.
[173:04.01]My grade for you, Ster.
[173:07.34]Mm-hmm.
[173:09.80]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[173:10.38]Hold on.
[173:10.78]Wait, hold on.
[173:11.28]Before you say your score.
[173:12.42]Okay.
[173:12.98]Don't I get bonus points because I only found out that I was supposed to do this last night?
[173:17.56]And I also have never played House Flipper before.
[173:21.69]I'm going to remove one point for complaining.
[173:24.77]So you got... I'm going to give you a 90.
[173:34.50]That outside is so fucking good.
[173:36.28]It just really is.
[173:36.94]It's just so good.
[173:38.64]That's a 90...
[173:43.80]Dude, the outside is just... The outside is just... I guess it's a 99 because of the minus one point.
[173:49.77]I did the Marge.
[173:51.27]I had Miku.
[173:52.07]Man, like, what am I missing?
[173:53.61]Yeah, I know, but you can't get a perfect score.
[173:57.37]That's just not going to happen.
[173:59.83]Yeah, that's why it's a 99.
[174:01.27]It's a 97.
[174:05.34]Should be 98, but... Well... I mean, but look at this outside, dude.
[174:12.06]Come on.
[174:12.90]Like...
[174:14.94]You know, it's not fair.
[174:16.16]You're an artist.
[174:18.55]How is that not fair?
[174:20.17]This is an artistic event.
[174:22.87]You're a real artist.
[174:24.65]I haven't drawn anything in like two years.
[174:27.22]Alright.
[174:29.32]Awesome.
[174:29.82]Very, very well done.
[174:30.70]Excellent.
[174:32.32]Good shister.
[174:33.58]See you in the finals.
[174:34.92]Yeah.
[174:35.92]Good luck to you.
[174:38.15]Good luck to you.
[174:39.13]Alright, so now we only have a couple more, and then we can get people into the last build.
[174:42.88]We got NL already building.
[174:45.34]And he may have already left, but I wanted to make sure he could get something going.
[174:48.52]Alright, Will, Neff, and Snuffy.
[174:50.97]He's going to be so mad.
[174:53.55]No, I mean, Stirr and Poke are just incredible.
[174:56.23]They're so good at this.
[174:57.49]I'm sorry.
[174:58.03]One thing I will say though, Jerma, that I will make clear, I kind of thought that my theme was good dinner or nice dinner and Snuffy's theme was naughty future tech.
[175:12.32]So please keep in mind that this is heavily naughty future advancement.
[175:21.24]Oh, okay.
[175:23.04]I thought it was like a hyphenate theme because it came out of the envelope.
[175:27.09]So Snuffy, if you want to go ahead and take it away.
[175:29.71]That's okay.
[175:31.94]I am very prepared.
[175:32.90]Alright, let me get yours up here.
[175:35.08]Let me send it I got a Is there any way to figure out which one is which like the name?
[175:39.89]How do I name it?
[175:40.61]So it like sends it properly, like snuffy house or something?
[175:43.79]That doesn't matter.
[175:44.51]It's okay.
[175:45.05]Okay.
[175:45.43]Yeah.
[175:46.77]I don't know which one is which.
[175:49.33]And if you do it again, it'll just give it'll give you like the most recent version.
[175:54.68]Maybe maybe that's it.
[175:55.86]I'm not sure it looks different than everybody else's.
[175:59.00]uh no this is this that's good that should be okay I'm gonna I don't wanna we're trying to do no spoilers so let me just turn everything off for a sec and chat yeah chat's grade for Ster was a 95 I mean obviously right nobody gets 100 there there are no f's and there are no 100s not possible alright let me get this open

[177:21.22]We'll find out very shortly.
[177:22.92]I am ready for the tour.
[177:26.05]Snuffy, take it away.
[177:27.45]Let's hope I'm in the right spot.
[177:29.37]Alright.
[177:30.07]So first of all, I want to say for extra points, I can't accommodate 100%, but I offer you this.
[177:36.61]Another classic household wife.
[177:39.93]Kata.
[177:41.64]I'll present to you my house of the future.
[177:44.72]I present to you... Now imagine, the year is 2074.
[177:49.61]Poping has never been harder.
[177:51.69]Society has moved to expand on the feces industry, capitalizing on the human struggle in need to squeeze.
[177:59.87]Now if you enter the facility, you see many chairs where people can present themselves as the scat offering.
[178:07.52]Those who watch, it's a place of comfort.
[178:11.28]It pushes technology beyond what we are used to.
[178:16.96]These are the industrial flushes on the wall here.
[178:21.00]As you can see, they're built to flushmax the fecal buildup.
[178:25.49]There's also a poop scalpel placed on the toilet, which is used to sever the offerings.
[178:31.22]This is a lengthy and painful experience.
[178:34.46]And thus the scat dome is an offering a place of comfort and solace.
[178:40.28]A gathering of others, if you will.
[178:43.29]Truly a technological advancement we overlooked in our modern lives.
[178:50.98]I love the titanium shit on the wall.
[178:53.52]That's great.
[178:54.16]Yeah, yeah.
[178:55.52]So, you know, Jeremiah, we wanted to extrapolate and really meditate on trends in the future.
[179:02.94]Now, in the future, of course, all food will be paste.
[179:06.64]And so the most lavish and extravagant thing a person in the future can do is take a, um, solid bowel movement.
[179:16.85]So we have a bowel performer or turd artist who sits on the throne while another performer uses the drill dough, uh, to perform a sounding dance.
[179:27.37]Now the cuck chairs around the room.
[179:29.77]I'm sorry.
[179:40.84]So these are cuck chairs.
[179:43.48]Yeah, to showcase the shartest, if you will.
[179:47.02]Oh, dear God.
[179:49.04]Cuck chairs.
[179:51.92]So this is... Okay, go on.
[179:53.56]Sorry, I don't want to interrupt.
[179:55.00]Yeah, and the poop chisel.
[180:00.15]Sometimes the artists turds are so dense that they can only be distracted by using it.
[180:10.89]You can almost call this a ritualistic experience where if you have to use the poop scalpel, you can offer it to the viewers.
[180:17.47]They can pass it around like an incense and take a sniff and pray for the future.
[180:23.26]I have to say, I gotta say, I love the fact that the prompt was technological advancements and we got a scat room with a bunch of cuck chairs.
[180:34.53]Oh my God, that's fucking funny.
[180:37.11]But it works.
[180:37.83]Somehow this works well.
[180:39.27]Like this works real, this is working for me really well.
[180:43.87]It just is.
[180:44.77]We're glad.
[180:46.23]We're very glad that we can bring our vision of the future to you.
[180:50.22]Thank you.
[180:50.72]I'm glad you see a similar future for mankind.
[180:53.44]What's going on here on the sky?
[180:56.32]I don't know.
[180:56.72]Futuristic ambience.
[180:58.35]This is probably what the neighborhoods will look like back then.
[181:00.89]I mean, in the future.
[181:03.03]That's the cuck scaffold.
[181:05.05]Theoretically, there'll be many, many buildings.
[181:09.19]It'll be a skyscraper.
[181:11.97]In New York City, you gotta crop to the neighborhood.
[181:18.41]That's the gas powering.
[181:19.51]I was going to say, do I dare ask what this is?
[181:22.35]It's the scat energy.
[181:24.39]A renewable source.
[181:26.59]Okay, I think I know what you guys are getting.
[181:28.13]In the future, all electricity runs on scat.
[181:31.54]People are going to get mad at this grade, but whatever.
[181:34.80]This is an A.
[181:37.53]it's it no it is because it's I mean it's ludicrous right but yeah it's the story it's the fact it's it's the fact that you took the naughty
[181:48.78]and actually made it naughty, even though you weren't really supposed to, but... Yeah.
[181:53.06]The future, I... I think this is a solid... This is like a 90... This is like a 93, 94.
[182:00.65]Yeah, this is a... You did a Marge Simpson, you did.
[182:08.01]I'm going to give it a 94.
[182:10.01]Oh, homie.
[182:11.45]Thank you for the 94.
[182:12.62]Alright, now it's a 95, because that was actually good.
[182:16.36]Oh, my God, yes!
[182:17.66]That was actually, that was unbelievable.
[182:20.86]That's a 95 now.
[182:22.12]No, what'd I say?
[182:25.40]94.
[182:28.98]Very, very good.
[182:30.18]Chat also gave you a 95.
[182:31.24]Yeah.
[182:33.96]Thank you.
[182:34.34]Thank you, everybody.
[182:35.90]It's just, it did it for me.
[182:38.26]It was just funny.
[182:38.95]It was great.
[182:39.51]Great job.
[182:42.00]I know someone's going to chime in right now and be like, you fucking piece of shit.
[182:45.92]My house had this and my... No, they recognize it.
[182:49.38]They recognize the hustle we put in.
[182:50.98]We had lore.
[182:51.64]We had a story.
[182:52.30]We had a beautiful showcase.
[182:53.48]We had imagery.
[182:54.30]We had impressions.
[182:55.10]We had, you know, characters.
[182:57.16]We had a whole world.
[182:58.10]That was world building.
[182:59.98]That house is actually fucking amazing.
[183:01.48]I just want to acknowledge that Jerma's reaction to seeing a scat house with cock chairs is that really does it for me.
[183:15.98]I might want to say don't clip that but uh alright alright we got one more build and then we're gonna go to the last one and god damn it that's true how many people are here watching there's not 100 there's not like a lot of people right how many people are here collectively or singularly collectively
[183:38.37]Probably, like, 50,000 people.
[183:39.85]Oh, God.
[183:41.88]Might have just... But, you know, you're just appreciating modern futuristic art.
[183:48.12]Remember, chat, you can download the Twitch clip before the VOD gets deleted.
[183:52.89]So that was, collectively, it's like, people think it's over 100k.
[183:56.63]That's crazy.
[183:57.65]Okay, cool.
[183:58.51]Alright, well, that's great.
[184:00.11]I'm going to retract that statement.
[184:01.93]And very fun.
[184:02.46]Alright, that was great.
[184:03.30]Great job.
[184:03.74]Excellent.
[184:04.92]Let's get to the last one, and then we can do the final build of the evening.
[184:08.36]The real one, the big one, the super one.
[184:10.90]Alright, Etalyx.
[184:11.42]Criken, where are you?
[184:13.24]Right here.
[184:14.14]Awesome.
[184:14.72]Criken, this is yours, right?
[184:16.08]Yep.
[184:16.70]Yes, we're here.
[184:20.36]Hard to follow that, though, to be honest.
[184:24.06]There you go.
[184:24.58]I tried doing Marge the whole time, but I don't know if it's going to be... Well, it's hard to follow everybody.
[184:30.28]Yeah, everyone's... We are the last, but also the first.
[184:36.11]I'm very curious.
[184:37.01]I'm excited about this one.
[184:40.73]Alright, let me make it so chat cannot see.
[184:47.01]And I'm going to... Actually, I might as well just turn my cam off because it's going to freeze.
[184:49.69]Or maybe it'd be funny.
[184:50.27]Alright, importing...
[184:57.30]You know when you can see it.
[184:58.57]Should be there very soon.
[185:05.39]Come on.
[185:08.27]Come on.
[185:10.27]Okay, there you are.
[185:12.19]Is it Kryken Room 2?
[185:13.06]Is that the right one?
[185:14.84]Yes.
[185:15.40]I am not going to look.
[185:16.08]Chat cannot see.
[185:16.86]And I'm going to get out of here.
[185:18.18]I'm going to just turn around and fly this way.
[185:20.34]Because I think it's the same starting point every time.
[185:22.44]I believe it is.
[185:23.14]Alright.
[185:25.64]Let me reset the cam.
[185:28.97]And then we'll be good to go.
[185:30.27]Somebody said you have a fuckboy face right now.
[185:33.31]What is that even?
[185:33.75]What are you talking about?
[185:34.47]Oh, it's because it was frozen on.
[185:35.47]It's like a weird image.
[185:36.15]Alright.
[185:37.27]Alright.
[185:38.19]I am ready.
[185:42.55]Criken, you have the floor.
[185:45.01]Oh, homie, welcome home.
[185:47.61]Turn around.
[185:48.64]Take a good look at our beautiful abode.
[185:52.18]It may be a bit smaller than you remember, but come on in.
[185:57.03]The technological advancements have really come a long way.
[186:02.73]Welcome to our gamer house, Homie Simpson.
[186:06.57]Alright, on the left, you will see various electric, nomenclature, gizmos and gadgets of all kinds.
[186:16.00]Because, you know, and I think that's a stovetop on the bottom of the floor.
[186:21.64]I was gonna ask is that is that a stove?
[186:24.37]Yeah, and I couldn't find a proper kitchen cabinet.
[186:27.53]But also, I think we're going to be heating things up on the floor.
[186:30.12]It's kind of like its own form of heating.
[186:32.14]Oh, like the music.
[186:33.58]We're going to start bumping.
[186:35.30]We're heating up.
[186:36.84]Yeah, we're heating up.
[186:37.83]First of all, I'm not going to give you any points because that was toad.
[186:42.13]Fuck, you're right.
[186:42.79]That was Toad.
[186:43.27]That was a little high-pitched there.
[186:44.51]It was a little high, but it was still a great effort, though.
[186:47.01]I'm going to give you one point.
[186:48.01]If Etalyx brings in the Homer, I can mirror that with March.
[186:52.15]But he needs to help me out there.
[186:54.52]What else?
[186:56.86]I wasn't cast as Homer.
[186:57.96]Okay, fair enough.
[187:01.19]Okay, so this is, you know, male living space was kind of our vibe.
[187:03.87]We wanted to kind of show what all streamers rooms are like kind of at the end of the day.
[187:08.68]We've got like the hobby corner, which, you know, is to say just a mixer.
[187:13.04]All of our Uber Eats deliveries kind of goes in like the nice food corner over there.
[187:18.74]We have a nice kind of metal box to retain the heat coming off of the PC.
[187:23.68]We also want to emphasize that the advent of technology does lead to a marked increase in waste.
[187:31.54]So we've represented that with the pizza corner.
[187:34.14]Interesting.
[187:34.94]Okay.
[187:35.64]And unlike some of the other houses out there, we did fit in a mattress.
[187:39.42]There is technically a sleeping space.
[187:42.70]It is a little infested.
[187:43.74]There's piss all over this.
[187:45.56]No, no, no.
[187:46.82]That's the foam.
[187:49.22]Oh.
[187:50.24]There are little cockroaches.
[187:51.42]You got to watch out for the springs, though.
[187:53.42]They're friends, though.
[187:55.84]Oh, there's the bugs.
[187:56.70]Oh, you had multiple bugs.
[187:58.07]Plus points.
[187:58.67]Multiple bugs.
[188:00.48]And then, of course, we're playing our new favorite game, House Flipper 2, that just released today on December... 14th.
[188:08.82]14th.
[188:09.16]Thank you very much.
[188:10.00]And so you can play right now if you want.
[188:11.88]Just go download it.
[188:13.08]Is it out now?
[188:14.36]Yeah.
[188:15.41]On the right, we have the bathroom.
[188:18.09]Oh, this is the bathroom.
[188:20.24]Yeah, labeled in case you missed it.
[188:24.36]We don't have cuck chairs, but I guess you could use the couch because I know you're into that, Jerma.
[188:29.59]God damn it.
[188:30.91]There's something out there.
[188:32.53]We have a cool poster.
[188:33.59]Cool.
[188:34.53]That's kind of futuristic energy.
[188:38.42]Have you looked up?
[188:40.22]Oh, yeah.
[188:40.56]That's cool.
[188:42.48]Yeah.
[188:43.62]You have, you have skylights.
[188:46.40]Right.
[188:47.52]And you know, we have some inspirational pictures here of like a kind of a cyber punk future at night.
[188:53.76]All the lights glow from like your led tower computer.
[188:58.76]I love the window represents the, uh, the solar powered future.
[189:02.37]Ah, okay.
[189:07.34]I like it.
[189:07.94]This is great.
[189:09.04]I have one note.
[189:10.36]The only note I have is it's more of like a note overall.
[189:13.90]Does everybody else think it's funny or like interesting that every depiction of a streamer is like a disgusting fucking slob?
[189:22.99]It's like, oh, so this is remember, this is like we're in the gamer room.
[189:26.65]It's like we're all just such gross slobs apparently.
[189:30.35]Art imitates life.
[189:31.45]I slept on a mattress on the floor with no box springs for over three years.
[189:38.61]It's very clean lines, cleanly made.
[189:42.57]Go ahead, sir.
[189:45.97]Say it again.
[189:48.93]I said you can verify that.
[189:50.51]I slept on a mattress for like three years.
[189:52.91]Oh, you did, yeah, on the ground?
[189:54.87]Yeah.
[189:55.25]Yes, I did.
[189:57.13]If you don't know, Talek and I used to live together, and he did sleep on a mattress on the ground.
[190:02.02]It was a nice mattress, though.
[190:03.06]It wasn't like a messed up one.
[190:04.76]It was a nice mattress.
[190:05.50]Yeah.
[190:07.41]I love the glass ceilings.
[190:09.47]One little small problem I have with the glass ceilings.
[190:12.69]Okay.
[190:15.01]How do you think the bugs got in?
[190:18.21]The house is in California or somewhere tropical.
[190:21.61]As you can tell, we were using a foundation provided by the showrunners that did not include central heat and air.
[190:27.77]So the only way to get the heat of the computer out of the house is by venting heat rises, as you know.
[190:33.64]So that's why we left the gaps above.
[190:38.09]Yeah, it's like a... I love how you can see, like, the lip of the roof, where it's like, oh, alright, so that's where the paint... I love it.
[190:44.99]Alright, I think I got it.
[190:46.67]I think I know.
[190:48.36]I very much enjoy it.
[190:49.68]I enjoy it.
[190:50.44]You also have the burglar system.
[190:52.60]Turn to your right.
[190:53.10]You do?
[190:53.38]The only house, I think, showed today that actually... Which is... We've already seen one team, unfortunately, get robbed.
[191:00.29]Technological advancement.
[191:01.89]Yeah, we wanted to make sure that we protected it against that with our own house.
[191:06.04]The fucking pizza boxes and pizza everywhere.
[191:10.46]Alright, I think you guys, it's solid.
[191:13.08]It's good.
[191:13.48]Now, based on what I've seen on social media, this isn't even the dirtiest gamer house.
[191:19.82]No, no, I would say this is probably, besides this corner, this is very well taken care of.
[191:23.88]I think I'm going to give you, it's a B, somewhere in the Bs.
[191:29.34]It's a...
[191:33.67]I don't think it's a low B because I like the... I really like the idea here.
[191:37.91]Nobody really did anything with the roof, really.
[191:40.98]There was a couple that kind of did stuff with the roof.
[191:43.00]But you guys like changed the roof entirely to like a glass kind of sky-like roof?
[191:49.58]There's also an all in one house like you have everything you need here to actually live here.
[191:54.04]In like a in like a House Flipper tournament.
[191:57.42]I'm not sure that you could actually live in or inhabit any of the previous homes.
[192:02.12]Probably not.
[192:03.38]I think this is it.
[192:08.29]It's a it's a solid B. It's like an 85 84.
[192:10.45]What did chat say?
[192:12.31]Yeah, what do you got?
[192:17.66]Chad is 85.
[192:18.50]Okay.
[192:18.88]Yeah, we're running the money.
[192:20.10]I think it's an 85.
[192:23.30]Solid B. Remember, these are only 10% of your final grade.
[192:26.08]The final build is 80% of your whole grade.
[192:29.58]So, those of you, everybody please come up to the main channel now, please.
[192:33.56]Because we got all of our grades.
[192:34.71]Let's take a look at where things stand right now.
[192:37.43]None of this matters.
[192:38.83]None of this means anything.
[192:40.19]If you have the highest grade or the lowest grade, who gives a shit?
[192:43.33]It doesn't mean anything.
[192:44.25]Half of these grades are just made up anyways.
[192:46.05]Alright, so.
[192:47.38]Are we all here?
[192:49.06]Yeah.
[192:50.26]How do we all feel?
[192:50.82]Hello, team.
[192:51.64]Back.
[192:51.99]Hello.
[192:53.43]Hello.
[192:54.27]It is now time.
[192:55.31]How we doing, gang?
[192:58.41]Everybody doing good?
[192:59.77]Everybody feeling like good?
[193:02.63]Yeah.
[193:02.83]I'm feeling ill.
[193:03.65]Really, really good.
[193:05.42]I'm okay, though.
[193:06.22]I'm good.
[193:07.53]I'm enjoying looking into everybody's sick and twisted house minds yeah I'm excited to flip for the main build I've also realized it's past midnight and we have not started 80 percent of the grade I'm gonna warn you right now buddy right now I'm gonna warn you right now jerma through this entire stream I've been planning my magnum opus through doing logic
[193:29.50]this logic is gonna maybe let this team win I mean congratulations to everybody else but it's going to be brain games towards the end and nobody's applied brain games yet so okay for the rest of you guys utilize his weakness that's all I'm going to say brain games use logic okay alright I don't I don't think you're meant to weaken the judge oh I am
[193:53.97]Let's just say this, everything that Jerem has said tonight is gonna rank up and score for me.
[193:59.04]You'll see, you'll see.
[194:00.42]Hey, we will see because this is the real, the big one.
[194:04.50]This is 90 minutes.
[194:06.90]So you've got a while to actually work together and make something real.
[194:11.09]This first, it was supposed to be like two hours and 20 minutes.
[194:14.15]We're at about three hours and 10 minutes.
[194:16.59]So we're a little bit over, but that's the way it is.
[194:19.07]Hope everyone's having a good time, but now let's start.
[194:21.72]This build, remember, very, very important.
[194:24.44]I know a few people, a couple people already are building because obviously some people have to leave.
[194:28.81]If you do have a hard out, if you have to get out of here in the next, like, hour...
[194:33.52]You build first.
[194:34.82]Be the first builder.
[194:36.26]So then when you have to leave, you can pass that.
[194:38.62]Make sure you save it.
[194:40.14]Pass that file, not to me this time, to your partner.
[194:43.99]And then they're going to build the rest of it.
[194:46.43]I wanted to kind of slot out somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes for it to be like, okay, after 45 minutes...
[194:52.38]Pass it over to your partner.
[194:54.02]I am not going to be like, wait, hold on a minute.
[194:58.74]RT, you built for 39 minutes and Kiwo only... No, no, no.
[195:02.58]It doesn't matter.
[195:03.32]It's just at some point, you guys should swap.
[195:05.55]And maybe you'll swap back.
[195:07.63]Who knows?
[195:09.09]You should screen share to each other.
[195:11.19]Take care of each other.
[195:12.43]Help each other.
[195:13.03]And without further ado, let's explain how you're going to do this.
[195:17.31]So, no template this time.
[195:19.68]Everybody...
[195:21.07]go to your property browser you're going to go to new property it doesn't matter where you go it may if you want this to be part of your whatever you're doing then absolutely you've got town you got coast in your forest do the big one this one here and the only thing I will tell you is please be aware of your file sizes because if you're going to swap with your with your partner
[195:48.82]don't if you're gonna do like 10 000 images like jpgs or something it this might be a huge file so just be aware of that keep track of that too like maybe take a look and say like oh fuck hold on how big is this uh but yeah you have total freedom you're gonna go to edit right you well you when you you create it right create this this place
[196:10.09]And I think, yeah, so every, yeah, you know, it is, it is sandbox.
[196:13.71]So when you create that place, you're going to be in sandbox mode, wherever you are, it should be pretty big.
[196:18.20]It's a pretty large amount of real estate for you to work with.
[196:21.88]You have an hour and a half.
[196:23.76]If you get done early and you're like, Hey dude, I'm done early.
[196:26.99]Then by all means, if somebody has to go pop off and the other person can give the tour,
[196:32.31]uh or hang out do whatever you want come back uh I'm imagining that if everybody is done and everybody's like hey we're kind of just sitting around it's been like 70 minutes then we're good we can just we'll close it but anyways are you all ready yes ready good to go yeah you guys got it are there any questions I can answer right now before we go
[196:54.13]Uh, will you kind of like come in?
[196:55.69]Oh, sorry.
[196:56.81]You go ahead.
[196:57.27]You go ahead.
[196:57.81]Oh, so I was going to ask, will you give us like a poke when we're like coming close to 45 minutes?
[197:01.95]Yes.
[197:03.10]Okay.
[197:03.40]Cause we will forget the time.
[197:05.36]So mods that are here.
[197:07.34]15 minutes would be great.
[197:08.58]Yeah.
[197:08.76]Maybe mods.
[197:09.42]If you could, every, you can also just open the stream too.
[197:12.50]Uh, the stream will have the timer gone.
[197:15.40]That takes more time.
[197:16.50]Yeah.
[197:17.29]No, we're going to be like laser eye focused on what we're building until the end.
[197:20.93]Like
[197:23.07]Yeah, well, I can do it too.
[197:26.01]Mons will help out.
[197:27.07]We'll help out.
[197:28.57]Alright, everybody.
[197:29.19]This is the big one.
[197:31.37]Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[197:32.30]I just got to double check.
[197:34.10]Do we have an hour each or is it the accumulated together?
[197:37.14]30, 30 minutes together.
[197:38.90]You have 45, 45 together now, but you don't have there is no time.
[197:43.64]You don't have to build for 45 minutes.
[197:46.52]If you want to build for 20 minutes and then pass it over to Vinny and then Vinny, maybe you build for a little bit.
[197:51.09]That's fine.
[197:52.31]I just want to give that opportunity so people aren't just sitting around for an hour and a half.
[197:56.25]Because I, Jerma, I'm warning you.
[197:59.49]It's going to take me five minutes to make the ultimate brain puzzle that through logic, you're going to lose, Jerma.
[198:09.06]You're fucking with my head.
[198:10.26]Alright.
[198:10.62]So we get 90 minutes total.
[198:11.88]90 minutes total.
[198:13.08]So scary.
[198:14.40]90 minutes total.
[198:16.50]I'm ready, Captain.
[198:17.42]Can everybody fly?
[198:18.86]Please just make sure no one's in play mode.
[198:21.48]Yes, Chef.
[198:23.04]Alright.
[198:23.76]And without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, the real, the final, the actual build.
[198:29.58]You've warmed up for a few hours.
[198:31.96]You got 90 minutes.
[198:33.90]Begin now.
[198:35.02]Go to your calls.
[198:36.60]Begin.
[198:36.86]Good luck, gang.
[198:37.70]Good luck, everybody.
[198:39.17]Make sure it is a... Good luck, all.
[198:41.51]Yeah, good.
[198:42.09]Good luck.
[198:45.45]Let's go.
[198:47.23]Yes, Chef.
[198:50.71]Me and the boys in creative mode.
[198:52.69]Are you playing?
[198:56.47]Why do you say JPG like JPG?
[198:58.79]I don't know.
[199:02.17]I have to go to the bathroom.
[199:03.49]So I'm going to leave this up so people can be aware of the time.
[199:07.04]But I'm going to go pee.
[199:09.10]I will be back in two or three minutes.
[199:13.20]Also, so the tours that are going to happen here, because we started at one.
[199:20.14]I don't want this to really go more than like five to six hours.
[199:26.43]So the tours are going to be strictly 10 minutes long, 10 to 12 minutes total.
[199:32.93]And I'm going to, I'm going to be keeping track to make sure we can really kind of move it along.
[199:37.26]I don't want to rush it, but in the testing that we've done, it seems like after about eight or nine minutes,
[199:44.20]You can pretty much get on a big build most of the things you want to do.
[199:48.24]So we're trying to keep it pretty strict.
[199:50.73]I will be right back and make this a better spot.
[199:56.41]Did that?
[199:57.15]The scat house is fucking with my brain.
[200:01.38]So funny.
[200:01.76]Alright.
[200:02.06]I'll see you guys a little bit back in two minutes.
[204:58.82]Hello.
[205:00.66]Sorry to jump scare you.
[205:01.44]I'm just going to get my drink refilled.
[205:03.79]I'll be right back.
[208:39.29]I'm back.
[208:41.29]And not only am I back, you're probably wondering, like, oh, 10 minutes have gone by.
[208:45.35]That's kind of cool.
[208:46.17]Hey, what are you up to right now?
[208:49.89]Well, you didn't think that I was going to do a fucking build in 90 minutes?
[208:55.11]You bet your ass I am.
[208:59.01]I'll show you how it's done.
[209:02.07]I'll show you how it's done.
[209:06.40]Cam can stay off.
[209:09.60]Alright, you guys ready?
[209:12.20]Here.
[209:14.14]I have a couple ideas.
[209:16.68]Hmm.
[209:19.96]Do you guys think it's cooler?
[209:23.65]Or... Actually, don't tell people I'm doing this.
[209:28.39]By the way, I hate that.
[209:30.39]There, that's cleaner.
[209:35.21]I'm going to start one.
[209:35.95]It'll evolve.
[209:36.33]Here we go.
[209:40.83]Hmm, okay.
[209:41.64]Let me go like this.
[209:48.60]This is going to blow everybody away.
[209:51.28]Just wait.
[209:53.20]I want wood.
[209:55.17]Natural stone.
[209:56.13]Is there wood?
[209:58.31]Marble?
[209:59.61]Stone?
[210:01.79]I guess this is kind of wood, right?
[210:04.13]I know it is natural stone, but it looks kind of... Oh, here we go.
[210:06.42]Here's wood.
[210:06.72]Let's see what this looks like real quick.
[210:12.93]Let's see.
[210:13.39]Hold on.
[210:16.35]That's not bad.
[210:16.89]Are you building a dream house?
[210:21.39]I am not building a dream house.
[210:23.31]You'll see where I go with this one.
[210:29.44]It's got to be right, though.
[210:30.76]I got to get it right.
[210:31.44]Because I got to give my tour.
[210:36.00]Oh, shit.
[210:36.26]I'm like screen sharing to it.
[210:37.80]Oh, it's just the mods.
[210:38.36]It's all good.
[210:38.66]It's all good.
[210:41.76]Okay, let me go like this.
[210:44.67]This has got to be a little bit higher.
[210:45.77]Because I'm going to build a massive fucking tree.
[210:53.57]And inside of that tree is going to be a magical fucking world.
[210:59.70]Don't tell anybody.
[211:04.74]This has got to be wider.
[211:05.34]I think it's going to be way wider.
[211:09.88]Let's see.
[211:14.15]Not bad.
[211:18.07]Okay, even taller.
[211:21.85]Shh, don't say it.
[211:22.39]Yeah, don't tell anybody.
[211:23.01]Come on.
[211:23.17]Alright, well, that's the limit.
[211:29.26]But that's okay, because I want to wow everybody.
[211:31.54]Wait, actually, it should be lower.
[211:32.94]Because of the branches.
[211:33.76]Okay.
[211:41.93]Down.
[211:42.05]Down.
[211:49.71]Is this Jeremy's Playhouse?
[211:54.28]You'll see.
[211:58.62]I'm not even sure I need custom images.
[212:00.34]I don't think I need custom images either.
[212:02.78]We'll find out.
[212:06.66]A Minecraft tree?
[212:07.98]Kind of, yeah.
[212:12.00]It's a work in progress.
[212:12.82]Look, I got like 90 minutes.
[212:13.73]I got it.
[212:24.33]All we need to do is the base.
[212:25.89]Actually, this is too long.
[212:26.75]It's fine.
[212:33.58]Don't forget, you need bone meal and honey.
[212:35.52]Is that a Minecraft thing?
[212:36.76]What does that mean?
[212:43.70]Dude, you spent 10 minutes.
[212:45.20]Oh, I thought you said I spent 10 minutes placing.
[212:47.64]You spent 10 minutes peeing.
[212:50.53]I don't need all the whole time.
[212:52.29]I'm an experienced pro.
[212:56.00]Alright, let's get the lid.
[212:57.40]Alright, that's a decent base, I think.
[213:10.24]It is kind of just a square, but hold on.
[213:16.18]Might be a little too wide.
[213:19.85]Yeah, it's too wide.
[213:25.27]Is it though?
[213:27.87]Yeah, let's do it.
[213:33.61]I think that's a good tree size right there.
[213:35.63]Okay.
[213:51.48]Did I go all the way?
[213:52.04]Shit, I didn't.
[214:01.28]okay I can do detail work later let's just let's do macro let's we can do the micro stuff later okay so now let's go like this it let me cook for a little while please
[214:34.98]You all know what I'm doing.
[214:42.33]I need, like... Is there anything that looks kind of like grass?
[214:47.09]Or like leaves, right?
[214:47.95]Okay, this might be alright.
[214:51.43]I just need a ton of these.
[215:02.60]Shit.
[215:03.02]Hold on.
[215:10.19]This is gonna be so good when it's done.
[215:16.64]I can't place them on the edges?
[215:19.46]Shit.
[215:21.90]Mmm, hold on.
[215:22.60]What about, like, grass?
[215:28.66]Okay, here we go.
[215:29.20]Let's plant.
[215:30.99]Maybe plants.
[215:31.43]What do you think?
[215:31.79]Plants?
[215:33.99]I'm gonna move my microphone closer.
[215:38.63]Maybe there's a plant that looks a lot like... I just want big volume.
[215:41.22]I want volume.
[215:42.06]Here we go.
[215:46.66]How big is this?
[215:50.10]That's not... That's pretty big.
[215:52.29]Can I transform this?
[215:57.23]I can't.
[215:57.81]That's fine.
[216:12.88]Bottom left, you have trees.
[216:17.46]I wonder if I can just paint it.
[216:20.79]I wish I could make them go sideways.
[216:23.15]I don't think I can.
[216:23.73]Hmm.
[216:33.21]No, I'm going to keep going with this.
[216:35.33]I think it'll work fine.
[216:37.11]What I'm trying to do.
[216:43.09]Can this be changed or rotated or anything?
[216:46.89]Sorry.
[216:47.13]I don't even need it.
[216:53.35]Let me get this part done first.
[216:57.94]Am I still... Okay.
[217:01.10]I need... I want it crouch length.
[217:02.38]A little bit more.
[217:07.88]Good.
[217:08.46]Now, a little bit more.
[217:13.90]Beautiful.
[217:14.28]Okay.
[217:15.84]Let's make this really, really nice.
[217:19.11]Oh, wait.
[217:19.47]I got the grass edit tool.
[217:20.57]Can I paint this?
[217:23.99]Does it have to be on grass?
[217:25.15]Shit.
[217:26.89]It does.
[217:36.16]Change.
[217:36.44]Yeah, we want this big.
[217:41.25]Is this doing anything?
[217:46.10]Oh, it's tight.
[217:46.66]Okay.
[217:47.14]Maybe I should do tidy.
[217:47.92]Okay.
[217:59.59]Let's go ahead and do this.
[218:12.54]Looks good.
[218:14.40]Perfect.
[218:17.05]here looking good looking good I'll do the detail work later I need the land tool here we go this wait pull back pull back you making a Minecraft house nope
[218:45.29]20 minutes have elapsed.
[218:46.37]Maybe if the mods could give a... Sort of a little, like, ding-ding.
[218:51.56]Or, like, I'll just say, like, Hey, you guys, 20 minutes have gone by.
[218:53.90]Alright, I don't want to go too big.
[219:20.73]uh no I'll drop that back down I want it to be I think grass is fine let's see okay now I'm just trying to get the base done so here we go
[219:48.87]Where can I build this?
[219:49.99]I'm gonna have to build down first.
[219:52.54]Let me try that.
[219:56.60]Are you making a big compost barrel?
[219:58.92]No.
[220:00.76]I'm making a magical world inside of a magical giant tree.
[220:07.86]And when you go in this magical giant tree, it's just like, oh, cool, it's a magical tree.
[220:12.42]What's down here?
[220:13.66]And I'm gonna make an entire magical world down here.
[220:28.94]But you didn't think we were going to do the whole fucking thing?
[220:38.27]I definitely don't want this to be wood.
[220:47.49]Dermoth, think of the file size.
[220:49.68]Well, I'm just going to be screen sharing it to people.
[220:52.96]And you guys, obviously.
[220:58.69]Hmm.
[221:00.45]I need a good surface down here.
[221:03.49]Because this cannot be the way it is right now.
[221:07.61]Hmm.
[221:09.47]No.
[221:12.40]Fuck the file size.
[221:17.72]What's magical?
[221:25.20]I don't mind.
[221:26.18]Maybe like a little cobblestone walkway around.
[221:33.73]Let's try that.
[221:39.49]It's kind of like the bottom of a fish tank.
[221:48.06]Do the yellow brick road.
[221:50.32]I don't think I can change the color of these.
[221:57.28]Let me remove this because it's not necessary anymore and it messes up the aesthetic.
[222:07.47]Cool.
[222:08.93]Okay.
[222:10.19]Forget about the floor.
[222:11.50]Actually, no, no, no.
[222:12.12]I have to do it.
[222:12.86]I gotta get it out of the way.
[222:13.66]I think it's something dark.
[222:18.32]Dark and mysterious looking.
[222:25.19]Decorative moss.
[222:26.47]Shingles.
[222:28.55]Cork.
[222:29.59]Particle board.
[222:31.39]Oh, here we go.
[222:31.97]Okay, this is iron.
[222:34.13]Old stone blocks.
[222:42.37]Moldy.
[222:42.89]How can I do?
[222:43.37]Wait, can I make this?
[222:43.95]I can make this darker, can I?
[222:44.79]Go.
[222:51.45]How does that look?
[222:56.61]I don't, I don't mind.
[222:58.79]This is a little too ambitious.
[223:01.05]Yeah.
[223:04.02]It kind of is.
[223:12.61]I don't have to use the whole space.
[223:23.48]That's an outlier.
[223:31.21]Good.
[223:35.73]You got points deducted for what?
[223:45.33]How's everybody else doing?
[223:46.37]How are the contestants doing?
[223:47.77]Good?
[223:47.93]Okay, I need lights.
[223:53.11]I need like really cool lights.
[223:54.53]Lamps.
[223:54.85]Maybe like floating lamps.
[223:58.06]Something really cool looking.
[224:00.86]Ooh, this kind of looks like a mushroom.
[224:05.32]Yeah.
[224:05.64]Alright, hold on.
[224:06.38]Can I... I think this is the light that's coming out of it.
[224:17.54]Uh, base and shade, temperature and brightness.
[224:19.90]Uh, there's the light.
[224:27.26]Cool.
[224:30.62]So what does this look like?
[224:34.49]Alright, the hole is right here.
[224:35.65]Go like this.
[224:55.93]Can I turn these on?
[224:56.97]There we go.
[225:05.13]These should be bigger.
[225:08.79]That's okay.
[225:10.07]Should I hang them?
[225:11.61]You're making a smurf house?
[225:14.10]Pink and green, pink and green.
[225:18.42]You just should make Undertale.
[225:22.15]Yeah, this is the trail.
[225:24.89]So I'm going to take you around like a tour of the magical world with the mushroom lights.
[225:30.11]Because I can do this too.
[225:35.69]So green?
[225:37.51]Green makes sense, right?
[225:48.91]Woo!
[225:49.93]I fell down.
[225:55.39]I need I got a cool idea on.
[226:03.69]You fishing rather you.
[226:04.97]OK.
[226:18.45]This looks stupid.
[226:26.10]I need a wall back here.
[226:27.46]Otherwise, it's not going to work.
[226:33.47]No, that's lit.
[226:43.81]I think I can duplicate too, so I don't have to do this every time.
[226:49.21]Let's do that.
[227:00.68]Can I just duplicate it?
[227:06.56]Where's duplicate?
[227:07.32]I know there's a duplicate.
[227:08.31]Is it just the hand tool?
[227:11.25]There we go.
[227:23.24]uh how do I okay there we go so I have to no so I have to do it individually because it's not duplicating them freezing it's just duplicating them here yeah because you have to use the transform tool so I have to do it by hand I'm gonna get this done then the event's gonna be over I'm gonna have a trail of mushrooms
[227:53.06]Alright, I'll go quick.
[227:53.88]Here we go.
[227:55.10]Doesn't need to be perfect.
[227:55.68]Just needs to exist.
[228:07.89]Fuck.
[228:08.65]It's R. Here we go.
[228:19.20]We'll just do the entrance like this.
[228:20.36]The whole thing doesn't have to be like this.
[228:33.77]Ooh.
[228:37.63]How are they flying?
[228:38.96]Magic.
[228:39.30]I like that better.
[228:53.97]If I have clean-up time, I'll come back and do this.
[228:56.23]But we gotta get some shit on here.
[229:00.07]Yeah, I'll come clean this up.
[229:03.67]Okay, so the first thing I want you to see is I want you to see.
[229:06.13]Have you go through one of these?
[229:09.08]Can I make it bigger?
[229:14.42]I think I can.
[229:22.18]Nope, that's fine.
[229:32.18]Let's prevent people from falling down.
[229:33.84]Would be swell.
[229:50.45]You're so creative.
[229:52.93]Um.
[229:53.11]I don't know.
[229:58.55]We'll see at the end.
[230:07.01]Alright, does the hole drop you right here?
[230:10.49]Oh, shit.
[230:11.46]It kinda does.
[230:12.22]So if you walked in, like, okay, the giant, like, tree.
[230:18.42]The magical tree.
[230:21.30]It's not done yet.
[230:24.33]Put some decorations here.
[230:25.33]And then what's this?
[230:26.85]Oh, what the fuck is going on?
[230:28.75]Whoa!
[230:30.85]Dude, let's go look at this magical world!
[230:40.31]Give me this.
[230:41.23]Stop doing that.
[230:45.21]Why are you doing that?
[230:52.23]Oh, I had a fishing rod.
[231:01.02]There we go.
[231:11.45]Hey.
[231:14.81]Hey.
[231:14.97]Alright, I'll get away from the lamp story.
[231:22.43]Missing one lamp remind me about that.
[231:25.17]OK, now I gotta make the path.
[231:29.99]The actual path is going to be this painted grass.
[231:34.21]Who?
[231:36.33]OK.
[231:38.81]Do like a little trail.
[231:42.82]Shit, never mind.
[231:48.96]Style to change.
[231:51.85]Something like cool, something nice, something snappy.
[231:57.19]I kind of like this.
[231:58.47]It's a giraffe, but we can change it to be.
[232:00.05]Hold on, what if I do like a?
[232:10.83]That's kind of magical.
[232:21.60]Hey!
[232:25.52]What the hell?
[232:28.84]Shit!
[232:30.07]Am I on an invisible wall?
[232:34.01]Oh shit, I think I have the bug.
[232:35.51]I think I have the bug.
[232:36.99]By the way, if you see anybody have that happen to them, they need to exit the game and just make sure to save it, come back, because the walls are not actually invisible.
[232:59.52]So if people are building walls and they're like, what the fuck?
[233:01.58]Why can't I do this?
[233:10.51]What is this?
[233:12.41]Is that what I built?
[233:13.81]No, it isn't, right?
[233:19.31]Shit!
[233:19.77]It's doing it again.
[233:20.57]Maybe this one's bugged.
[233:28.05]I got a bug.
[233:29.31]I got multiple bugs.
[233:32.83]Oh, so Squeaks.
[233:33.86]Squeaks is asking about time.
[233:35.90]So Northernlion built for 17 minutes.
[233:39.06]So Squeaks, you have from right now.
[233:42.36]So you have, it's been 35 minutes.
[233:45.46]So Squeaks has... Oh yeah, Squeaks, when did you start?
[233:50.75]Because you should have probably like
[233:58.45]70 minutes?
[234:00.77]73 minutes, maybe?
[234:02.57]Yeah, in total.
[234:09.57]What am I doing wrong here?
[234:10.93]What did I do?
[234:13.57]That's not giraffe pattern.
[234:14.90]Alright, well, we have to pivot.
[234:25.62]We're going to pivot.
[234:31.24]shit did the default one work or did I break my game no that works yeah what the hell okay alright pivot time what should I do instead let's see I might just do paint this looks kind of good this green looks kind of cool that's right
[235:00.69]There we go.
[235:01.65]Okay, cool.
[235:16.32]Place another lamp?
[235:21.84]I will in like an hour.
[235:25.76]But I kind of want the whole thing to be this thing.
[235:27.91]Because this is too dark.
[235:30.27]Yep.
[235:34.61]And I'm going to scale it back.
[235:42.72]Like here.
[235:48.80]That's way better.
[235:49.72]That's a thousand times cooler.
[235:53.36]Okay.
[235:56.39]So here's what I want to do.
[235:57.07]I want like a gazebo.
[235:57.95]Do they have them?
[236:07.21]It's a wedding.
[236:09.97]Wait, I, this is, I thought this was, they didn't put the images in.
[236:13.51]I, I thought that was a custom image.
[236:18.11]That's funny.
[236:21.83]Alright.
[236:22.23]Let's go with, I mean, obviously like rocks and mushrooms and shit.
[236:25.45]Let's just, just wait, hold on.
[236:26.97]Let's go like this.
[236:34.34]Okay.
[236:34.52]Let's transform this.
[236:42.47]I'm going to make this bigger.
[236:49.99]Shit.
[236:50.13]It's okay.
[236:53.82]These look like steak chunks.
[236:57.18]Okay.
[237:10.33]This is not going to be the same color.
[237:11.49]I just want to get it up here.
[237:28.51]That looks good.
[237:29.87]Okay.
[237:33.42]Nice parking garage.
[237:35.62]Hold on a minute.
[237:36.58]I'm working here.
[237:37.70]Alright, I want to go do the outside.
[237:40.44]Alright, what can I use?
[237:46.29]Like wood.
[237:49.49]Planks or something?
[237:50.29]Here we go.
[237:52.57]How big are these?
[237:59.74]I think I have to just build them, I think.
[238:02.54]Yeah, we'll just go from here.
[238:03.28]This is going to take so long, but who cares?
[238:05.95]Hmm.
[238:20.28]This one, right?
[238:20.88]Which one did I use?
[238:21.52]I think it's this one.
[238:31.63]He's gotta be way thicker.
[238:32.69]Okay.
[238:53.27]Yeah, the whole thing with this is just all the detail work with the limbs.
[239:03.50]Hey, if I build a tree in 90 minutes, I don't care.
[239:40.59]Hey, art is ugly before it's done, right?
[239:43.57]Give me another hour.
[239:46.37]Yo, Jeremy.
[239:47.35]Hey, what's up?
[239:48.67]Jerma.
[239:50.07]What can I do for you?
[239:50.53]How you doing?
[239:51.39]Jerma, I got a question for you.
[239:53.91]Sure.
[239:58.25]What's up?
[239:58.49]Jerma.
[240:00.31]Are you alright?
[240:01.39]Jerma.
[240:01.93]Are you good?
[240:03.09]Am I muted?
[240:04.15]No, no.
[240:04.65]Do you want do you need to be muted?
[240:05.83]Can you hear me?
[240:06.85]Oh, I'm muted.
[240:07.83]I'm so sorry.
[240:08.59]It's me.
[240:08.95]Okay.
[240:09.53]I thought I was screaming into an echo chamber.
[240:14.19]My question is this.
[240:15.87]Can I take some of the time from my segment and give it to Vinny?
[240:23.14]Yeah, so are you do you get a bounce?
[240:26.14]No, no, no, no, no, I am being cocky.
[240:28.64]And I'm saying that if I were to give Vinny
[240:32.51]I don't know, five, ten extra minutes.
[240:34.25]Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[240:35.83]Oh, you can use I can use.
[240:37.65]OK, well, OK, noted, noted, noted.
[240:39.55]Yeah, there's no there's no actual limit of how long you have to build for.
[240:43.19]I just wanted to make sure people had an opportunity to do so so they didn't sit around.
[240:46.93]OK, well, you know, I appreciate that, but somebody in chat said, Joel, you didn't listen to Jerma.
[240:52.43]Listen.
[240:54.18]I don't speak English good and I don't understand most of what Jerma says.
[240:57.38]I just agree and say, yeah.
[240:59.94]Wait, what do you mean?
[241:03.60]Yeah, your time is shared.
[241:05.48]So you share the time, but you can swap if it's like, hey, let me take it for like 20, 30 minutes while you watch.
[241:10.63]It's just a way to make it so people didn't have to just watch their partner make a fun house without them.
[241:17.73]Yeah.
[241:19.19]But yeah, this time is shared.
[241:21.87]Okay, thank you.
[241:22.39]Bye-bye.
[241:23.07]Thanks, yeah.
[241:23.73]Yep, take care.
[241:26.05]Hey, Jerma, Snuffy had a question if you could change the color of the lights.
[241:30.73]Ah, you can change the color of the, I think the shades.
[241:35.01]So if you go, let me see if you can actually, you probably can.
[241:37.81]Let's see.
[241:39.21]I type in like lamp.
[241:44.27]Let's see.
[241:45.01]Here's a lamp.
[241:46.37]I press E. You can, so I think it's the temperature of the light.
[241:51.66]It also could be the bulb socket too.
[241:53.36]So if you go to, I don't know if Snuffy, I'll jump down there and tell her.
[241:59.13]yeah we're reaching the halfway point if you could I think it's a good idea I'll I'll pop around I'll pop around yeah alright thanks Mr. j yep hello uh hi do not do not give me any spoilers but I am here to help uh the light you can change from what it looks like you can change the temperature I don't know if you can have custom colors
[242:25.49]Yeah.
[242:26.01]I was wondering if there was any possibility for like RGB lighting or not.
[242:29.70]It doesn't have to like cycle, but just like a blue or green light or something like that.
[242:34.34]I wonder if the shade would change it.
[242:38.41]I think the the I think the temperature is kind of turning it into like a cooler light or just like a warmer yellowish which which is fine I was just wondering it's not a big deal there might be it's just the game is just it's so early that there's like temperature and I don't think I don't think changing the base will do it either I do enjoy though that maybe my ideas will inspire them to add it later yeah that'd be cool House Flipper 1 had like five expansions so
[243:08.26]I played only a little bit of that one, so this one definitely seems very limitless.
[243:12.32]I'm very excited.
[243:13.02]This is my first house, Flipper.
[243:14.75]Oh, it's great.
[243:15.67]And he's built something insane.
[243:17.53]Yeah, it's a lot of fun, especially just kind of messing around.
[243:21.33]The actual game, too, is really fun, too.
[243:23.63]But I don't want to distract you.
[243:24.43]I don't want to distract you anymore.
[243:26.04]Okay, okay.
[243:26.68]But yeah, I think it's temperature only as of right now.
[243:29.04]Okay, how do I make a moat?
[243:33.21]Also, by the way, we're at 45 minutes, just to let you know.
[243:36.55]So there's another... Is that when we should switch?
[243:38.52]You don't have to switch if you don't want to.
[243:40.46]I just wanted to give that opportunity.
[243:41.70]It's shared time.
[243:42.26]I will switch.
[243:43.16]I will switch.
[243:43.92]So make sure you save and export that as a mod, the same way that you did before.
[243:48.22]Yeah, the way that you gave it to the Discord in the first place, just do that same thing, that export as a mod, and just pass it over.
[243:59.08]Okay, so game saved.
[244:01.40]And then where is it?
[244:03.08]It's say, where's the mods thing again?
[244:05.66]So if you go to if you're in the mode, hit tab, property settings at the top, export as mod in the bottom right.
[244:12.52]Yep.
[244:13.96]And then whatever that that file comes up that zip.
[244:16.76]That's the one that you imported importing is escape.
[244:20.39]Property browser, mods at the top.
[244:24.97]And then import.
[244:27.91]Okay, snuffle up guys.
[244:29.60]Alright.
[244:30.32]You're not ready for what I got.
[244:32.72]I'll see you guys in 45 minutes.
[244:36.29]Alright.
[244:37.11]Hey, no spoilers.
[244:39.29]I don't want to see anything.
[244:39.99]I'm not looking at anything.
[244:41.27]We're at the 45 minute mark.
[244:44.11]Yes, sir.
[244:45.07]There you go.
[244:45.73]See you later.
[244:46.27]Good luck.
[244:49.40]Hello.
[244:49.78]No spoilers.
[244:50.54]Hi, I'm here.
[244:51.76]I'm not looking at anything.
[244:52.62]I don't see anything.
[244:53.20]We're at the 45 minute mark.
[244:55.82]Yeah, it's all good.
[244:56.58]We actually swapped a minute or like about two minutes earlier, Jerma, because my game actually kind of started freezing.
[245:01.76]Like I couldn't control everything.
[245:03.18]We were like two minutes off, so we were like, fuck it, just... Yeah, you can swap as much as you want.
[245:09.26]Okay.
[245:10.78]Don't worry about the whole swapping thing was just to make it so, hey, you can if you want to, but if you guys can work together...
[245:17.91]and like you can obviously you're streaming at it what I didn't want people to be sitting around yeah they wanted to go and you're grand oh thank you thank you we've got about 45 minutes okay thank you we're having we're having a lot of fun with ours nice good hey don't give me spoilers hello I'm here I have a quick thing to bring up it is 45 minutes have elapsed you got about 45 minutes

[246:11.31]Well, then you're good.
[246:13.86]OK, well, yeah, let me know.
[246:15.28]I started completely anew after he left.
[246:18.38]Yeah, I'm going to finish with the group or whatever.
[246:20.08]I don't want to, you know.
[246:21.12]No, you're good.
[246:22.24]If you started, you could probably just do 17 minutes added.
[246:25.20]That's fine.
[246:25.54]OK, perfect.
[246:26.44]Perfect.
[246:27.38]So we've got about like because you're not your presentation isn't for about 30 minutes after the build.
[246:32.60]20 minutes after the build.
[246:34.62]Yeah.
[246:34.78]So you got time.
[246:36.04]OK, awesome.
[246:36.78]Thank you so much.
[246:37.58]Yeah.
[246:37.95]Talk to you soon.
[246:39.54]Hey, what's going on, dude?
[246:42.94]You know.
[246:44.42]Buildings.
[246:46.14]How are you doing?
[246:47.66]We're at almost a 50-minute mark.
[246:50.15]Yeah, so Connor tossed me what he built so far.
[246:54.49]And I'm just putting some finishing touches on it, making sure it's all ready because it was...
[246:59.26]Very, very complete.
[247:00.36]And we had a very good vision going into this.
[247:03.11]And really coming together towards the end now.
[247:07.23]I have no idea what I'm in store for, but I'm looking forward to it.
[247:11.71]Hopefully it's better than the last thing we presented him.
[247:14.41]That's the goal.
[247:16.79]No, you're good.
[247:17.57]Don't worry.
[247:19.27]It's looking great.
[247:20.79]Opinion about 40 minutes.
[247:23.01]Alright.
[247:23.35]Sounds good.
[247:23.81]Thanks, dude.
[247:27.25]hello I am here and I'm sorry to jump scare you but I want to make I'm not looking at anything don't worry don't see the screens here where you guys got about 40 minutes 45 minutes we're at the halfway point oh okay so I was confused um
[247:40.69]So do I have to send her the file and she has to keep going?
[247:44.21]Yeah, you don't have to do that.
[247:47.11]This is shared time.
[247:49.07]It's just if your partner wanted to build, then yeah.
[247:51.91]If you're screen sharing and your chats can see everything and you guys are working together, that's fine.
[247:57.16]But I just want to give people the opportunity to swap the file if they want to kind of at the halfway point.
[248:02.06]Thank you.
[248:02.54]Okay, sick.
[248:03.78]Thanks, dude.
[248:04.38]Yep, take care.
[248:06.70]Bonnie, do you want to farther back?
[248:09.08]I am here right now.
[248:09.96]I'm here.
[248:10.34]Sorry to jump scare you.
[248:11.30]I am in your call.
[248:12.28]I'm saying we're at the 49 minute mark.
[248:14.36]We're just about halfway through.
[248:16.04]If you want to swap, you can.
[248:17.81]You don't have to.
[248:19.21]But by all means, if you feel like swapping, we got about 45 minutes left.
[248:23.65]Cool.
[248:24.01]Thanks, Jerma.
[248:25.03]Jerma, I have a heart out at six.
[248:27.01]So if we present first, I could probably be there.
[248:30.51]But otherwise, Lyd can do it.
[248:31.79]Yeah, yeah.
[248:32.65]I think the plan is because CDawg already left.
[248:35.41]So I think you're the last person here with a pretty hard out.
[248:39.77]So you guys can just go first.
[248:42.09]Cool.
[248:42.87]Alright.
[248:43.41]See you in about 40 minutes.
[248:45.15]Alright.
[248:45.39]I like you, man.
[248:46.66]Hey, I like you too.
[248:52.36]I'm in your call right now.
[248:53.50]Hi, how are you?
[248:54.58]Hi.
[248:55.52]Hey.
[248:56.52]I just want to say we're at the 50-minute mark.
[248:58.56]We're just about over the halfway point.
[249:01.94]I just want to thank you ahead of time for giving us an extra 15 minutes to build.
[249:04.80]Oh, you're welcome.
[249:05.90]Absolutely.
[249:06.25]You're welcome.
[249:09.65]We're doing so good, by the way.
[249:10.83]How do you guys feel?
[249:12.03]Listen, I have to pick up my daughter soon.
[249:15.61]So that means I'm pretty sure we get to build more now.
[249:23.00]What does your build look like?
[249:25.46]Don't tell me.
[249:25.84]That's a surprise.
[249:27.88]I'll just say you're going to get blown away.
[249:30.52]I'm looking forward to it.
[249:32.02]Your two mines together?
[249:34.64]We'll produce at least an 85.
[249:36.56]Our mines are together right now.
[249:40.91]Oh, yeah.
[249:41.95]Our mines are very together.
[249:43.67]Again, if you guys want to swap, you can, but it's not like a necessity.
[249:50.23]We actually did the whole export-import, and he's got the baton.
[249:54.33]Oh, shit.
[249:54.67]Okay, cool.
[249:55.73]Alright, you guys are on top.
[249:56.47]Thank you for the heads up.
[249:58.39]You will be yelled at by mods in about 40 minutes to tell you that you have about five minutes left.
[250:04.88]And then I heard you laugh, so that must be funny in there.
[250:09.22]Yeah, I didn't know gravity worked that way.
[250:13.00]We're learning about gravity.
[250:14.22]Alright, I'll leave you to it.
[250:15.26]Alright, I am now alone in the call.
[250:23.03]Excellent.
[250:24.56]I lost a bunch of time building.
[250:25.82]Eh, I'm just doing it to pass the time anyways.
[250:29.43]What was I doing?
[250:29.91]Oh, yeah.
[250:33.43]You wasted 20 minutes of your own build.
[250:34.91]Well, yeah, but I'm just doing this to... Because remember, I haven't played very much of this either.
[250:39.86]This is probably...
[250:42.98]I mean, maybe like an hour, maybe a couple hours of just kind of making sure I could look around and know.
[250:48.50]Because one of my main concerns, I want to make sure I knew all like, hey, this is where you go.
[250:53.76]This is what you do.
[250:54.44]This is how you do it.
[250:55.98]I didn't really play the game as much as I was like messing with the systems in the game to make sure this could work.
[251:01.33]But I'm really excited to play it.
[251:14.67]Are you going to work on this throughout the weekend?
[251:17.33]I think what I'm probably going to do tomorrow is I want to start the base game.
[251:22.33]Because sandbox mode is awesome, but I really want to know... Because there's a whole storyline mode and stuff.
[251:30.08]I'm curious about it.
[251:34.44]What time tomorrow?
[251:35.96]That is a good question.
[251:37.52]I will... The sauce will be there.
[251:40.86]So, probably, I think, mid-morning, early afternoon.
[251:44.04]Probably around the same time today.
[251:53.35]Did you beat the campaign of House Flipper 1?
[251:56.53]I don't... I don't know.
[251:58.05]Did I?
[251:59.13]I mean, I played House Flipper 1 a lot on stream, but I don't know if we did the campaign very much.
[252:06.47]I don't know if there really... There was a campaign.
[252:08.17]It wasn't a huge one, but...
[252:10.46]I did a lot of missions.
[252:23.87]I am so looking forward to what people build though.
[252:29.99]I love these kind of streams because I just get to kind of peek into the minds of other streamers.
[252:35.04]It's fun.
[252:52.86]I don't know how many little leaves I can get and branches I can get, but I'm just going to go for it.
[253:00.60]Dude, this is an F right now.
[253:12.69]I got to speed it up.
[253:13.45]We got to just go random.
[253:23.00]Just trying to make branches.
[253:23.84]Okay, I need... Holy shit, I have a fucking new idea.
[253:42.35]I have a new idea.
[253:49.47]Is there a bridge?
[253:56.80]Can I stand on these?
[253:57.56]I can.
[254:02.55]Perfect.
[254:13.83]I need a staircase.
[254:23.72]McDonald's playground.
[254:29.47]That is a huge staircase.
[254:31.51]Can I make like an elevator?
[254:32.49]Let's see.
[254:35.61]I think I could probably do a, something that looks like an elevator and it's implied that it's an elevator.
[254:41.03]Why would this be in the game?
[254:42.91]Holy shit.
[254:43.51]It's in the game.
[254:44.04]Oh no, it's not.
[254:46.56]I need like a little, like a little cage or something.
[254:48.76]A little.
[254:49.08]Hmm.
[254:59.11]Thing is not being familiar with the items.
[255:02.29]What could I do?
[255:05.25]Yeah, like a little thing you get in like an elevator.
[255:09.29]Maybe like a. Let me look at the outdoor furniture.
[255:12.12]This is nature.
[255:21.44]Here we go.
[255:27.12]Which one of these looks like an elevator?
[255:41.13]Here's my idea.
[255:41.69]This is like an outdoor nature elven house.
[255:50.08]And then that's where you sleep and then you can jump into the pool from there.
[255:55.62]And that's exactly what I'm going to do when I show it.
[255:58.37]I need a bed.
[256:14.77]What kind of bed should I have?
[256:15.47]Let's see.
[256:17.88]Yeah, and this is... Hey, this is not even a real build.
[256:20.64]I was gone for 10 minutes in the beginning.
[256:22.46]I was just gone for like 25 minutes helping people.
[256:24.94]This is not a real build.
[256:25.78]This is just... I'm just passing the time.
[256:28.48]Oh, I like that.
[256:30.66]This is a huge... What kind... How big is this bed?
[256:32.82]Oh, no.
[256:34.32]I was just really close to it.
[256:40.41]I need a... End table.
[256:42.45]End table.
[256:49.49]Cool.
[256:49.89]I think the first one's good.
[256:57.44]Wait, what can I do with it?
[257:03.72]I want it to be wood.
[257:04.38]Nice.
[257:15.96]I just realized if you are a person that moves around in your sleep, you're rolling out of this bed and you're dead.
[257:24.46]You're gonna, you're gonna roll into the pool and drown.
[257:27.16]Okay, I need like a little, like a cute little lamp.
[257:39.69]Like a nightlight maybe?
[257:47.09]Ooh, yeah.
[258:08.09]I wish it was nighttime.
[258:18.26]Alright, do you know those experiments where it's like, oh, hey, so this is what happens when we give somebody LSD and tell them to do something.
[258:28.57]This is one of those things.
[258:33.77]Yeah, oh, so this is interesting.
[258:34.79]This is what happens when you take cocaine and do this.
[258:37.55]Oh.
[258:37.69]Hey, it's alright.
[258:46.35]It's not done.
[258:52.17]I can already hear Ludwig.
[258:56.69]No, I have some safety concerns about that bed.
[258:59.41]Shut up, Ludwig.
[259:12.56]Yeah, I could see, like, Ster.
[259:15.28]Ster's going to be like, oh, what happened to the top?
[259:17.34]What happened to the top?
[259:18.70]Nothing on the top, huh?
[259:20.18]Shut up, Ster.
[259:25.77]I took a lot of LSD, okay?
[259:31.03]Uh, it's, I need different wood.
[259:33.59]Wait, hold on.
[259:39.52]What about, like, nature?
[259:40.34]Let's type that in.
[259:48.12]It's kind of like a Zoombini house.
[259:54.01]It's so medieval.
[260:01.33]No one is sleeping on these.
[260:05.33]Maybe they will.
[260:07.29]It's like a little elven community.
[260:11.09]What you guys don't understand is this might look big to you, but this is half an inch tall.
[260:18.39]This is where the fucking Keebler elves live, alright?
[260:24.70]Give me a break.
[260:25.18]Let's do we go.
[260:37.87]Everybody has to get a headboard.
[260:53.16]I can already hear Etalyx now.
[260:57.91]How come that one's not one block taller than this one?
[261:02.27]Shut up, Etalyx.
[261:02.99]There we go.
[261:22.16]Ooh, wait a minute.
[261:23.76]Wait a minute.
[261:24.63]Wait a minute.
[261:26.67]Watch this.
[261:30.96]Oh, look at that little like elven community.
[262:03.18]The same lamps.
[262:04.94]I like these.
[262:11.35]Breaking news.
[262:11.93]Three Keebler elves die in their sleep.
[262:19.56]Let me get rid of some of these walls.
[262:20.70]I don't need them all.
[262:31.33]I want it to be whimsical, but not... There's too many lines, right?
[262:35.03]There's too many hard lines.
[262:37.13]Yeah, that's a little bit better.
[262:38.19]And we can put leaves and shit over here.
[262:39.61]Remember, I'm not... There's only 25 minutes left.
[262:43.88]But I've been moving around.
[262:45.06]I've been talking to people.
[262:45.80]I've been talking to you.
[262:46.48]I've been talking to people.
[262:47.58]I need a couple down here.
[262:55.94]I've really got to start building leaves, though.
[262:58.48]Let's get on that now.
[263:06.35]Hmm.
[263:09.11]Okay, cool.
[263:10.71]This is big.
[263:33.51]He's got a tuft of hair.
[263:37.36]You should use the real trees as branches.
[263:40.24]I don't think you can put them sideways.
[263:46.37]I think they have to be in the ground.
[263:47.35]This thing is... Holy shit, this tree is massive.
[263:58.21]This tree is the biggest tree I think I've ever seen.
[264:02.56]You should check Vinny's stream.
[264:04.04]I'm not... I don't want to see anything.
[264:09.69]Can this go anywhere?
[264:10.57]How big is this?
[264:13.23]That thing is gigantic.
[264:37.26]Come on.
[264:49.62]This hides it, by the way.
[264:51.12]Look at how well this hides it.
[264:57.89]And let me do this with that shit that's dirted.
[264:59.61]Hold on.
[265:15.94]And you put hedges up on the roof.
[265:18.72]Maybe bushes.
[265:19.76]Let's see.
[265:20.18]Yeah, like hedges.
[265:27.99]Yes!
[265:28.55]Oh my god.
[265:29.29]That person saved my entire life.
[265:47.78]I gotta remove all these.
[265:48.58]Uh, just delete them.
[265:53.33]Uh, in about 10 minutes, I'm gonna go give 10 minute warning.
[266:13.50]Yeah, that'll look good.
[266:14.92]It'll look like spiked hair, but who cares?
[266:18.82]Ooh.
[266:21.22]Let me check and see if I can resize this.
[266:23.10]I cannot.
[266:23.53]Okay.
[266:26.61]What's the biggest one?
[266:27.51]This is 16, 28 by 60.
[266:27.85]Yeah, this is the one here.
[266:41.79]I want it to be sticking out over the edge.
[266:44.27]So then I can... If I build some more boards, I can make it kind of look like it's supposed... Like, you know what I mean?
[266:48.92]Put these on the boards to make it look like the tree has a bunch of leaves.
[266:53.96]Squeaks has about five minutes left.
[266:58.06]Um... Does Squeaks have five minutes?
[267:09.81]Yeah, because I could do boards out and build like this.
[267:13.31]This is why this is one of the reasons why I did it like this.
[267:26.90]Vinny just rage quit House Flipper.
[267:29.73]Alright, let me go.
[267:31.73]Let's see.
[267:33.85]Talk to Squeaks.
[267:37.76]Because that would be, yeah.
[267:38.60]So Sweet has about five.
[267:40.56]No, a little bit more than that, right?
[267:42.10]Because he had six.
[267:43.26]But he did say that.
[267:45.18]No, I think he's good.
[267:46.14]No, he's good.
[267:47.10]Because he did say that they just kind of talked and he didn't build anything.
[267:51.79]So he just started essentially from scratch after they talked.
[267:55.09]So that's fine.
[268:01.27]Wait, undo.
[268:01.61]I need to be able to walk to that.
[268:19.35]I have a different idea.
[268:31.62]This looks like a Mario cactus.
[268:39.47]But, hold on.
[269:05.82]I mean, the, the theory is there, but this is the equivalent of spilling a glass of milk in a house slipper.
[269:28.99]Can I hide this?
[269:30.07]I definitely, okay.
[269:31.19]I definitely can do this right.
[269:33.53]But it's going to take way more than 20 more minutes.
[269:37.08]Just take a look.
[269:37.72]I can do this shit.
[269:39.26]Right?
[269:41.58]And then stagger these so they actually are... Yeah, that's going to take a while.
[269:46.63]But you know what I'm talking about.
[269:49.99]I could actually have them almost like stadium seated.
[269:55.12]It's alright.
[269:55.50]My point can get across.
[270:14.84]Oh my god.
[270:21.28]It's the Kirby thing.
[270:21.92]It's the House of Kirby.
[270:32.91]Without looking it up, I think this is kind of close.
[270:50.00]Uh, alright.
[270:51.58]I know I'm just kind of just, just lashing into myself here, but this looks like a child's drawing that has been 3D-ified.
[271:15.16]The interior is, uh, I had this whole idea of like a magical kingdom down here and it's just a bunch of rocks.
[271:20.78]I was just putting rocks down here.
[271:25.59]I don't have time.
[271:27.35]Wait, I could do this.
[271:48.68]Okay, come on.
[272:19.29]This is so far away.
[272:23.11]Okay.
[272:23.31]Can I write like a sign?
[272:27.90]Can you read this?
[272:37.38]Oh, okay.
[272:38.06]Pretend this says, pretend this says, thank you for participating in the house slipper to invitational.
[272:49.00]Just pretend that's what it says.
[272:57.15]That's a little bit of a stretch.
[272:59.17]Okay, I need, like... I need all that shit here.
[273:03.47]Hold on.
[273:06.18]Uh... Hmm.
[273:11.36]Hmm.
[273:20.12]Is this too high?
[273:20.78]I think the nose is way too high.
[273:22.44]I need little air.
[273:26.51]So this is where they come out here.
[273:27.67]They walk over here.
[273:28.55]I need like a little... I need stairs.
[273:33.59]Here we go.
[273:34.01]Architectural elements.
[273:36.89]Fence.
[273:39.02]Oh my god.
[273:39.80]There's a roof.
[273:40.36]Okay.
[273:48.90]How do these work?
[273:59.07]Oh man.
[274:04.66]Well, I... Okay.
[274:23.56]Hmm.
[274:24.80]I think I need to have something to connect to.
[274:38.44]It's functional.
[274:39.16]That's all that matters.
[274:52.78]You have to jump a little bit.
[274:53.52]It's fine.
[275:04.88]Alright, we are at this 15 minutes remaining.
[275:07.79]I am going to go tell everybody this.
[275:10.51]Oh, Esme has a question.
[275:13.59]I am here for a question I hope I can answer.
[275:16.63]You guys have a question?
[275:22.71]How are you?
[275:26.39]I am here.
[275:29.31]I am not looking at anything.
[275:30.47]I have not seen anything.
[275:31.25]I've not heard anything.
[275:31.91]I heard there's a question.
[275:33.82]Wait, I didn't know that voice in my keyboard.
[275:37.24]Wait, did I hear someone?
[275:38.48]Yeah, it's me.
[275:39.24]Oh, hi.
[275:40.30]I was told you have a question.
[275:42.73]Oh, how's your day going?
[275:44.87]It's going very well.
[275:45.83]I don't have a question.
[275:46.81]Chat, one guy do.
[275:48.03]Oh.
[275:48.13]Do you have a question I just found?
[275:50.55]No, I'm good.
[275:51.05]I'm back.
[275:51.53]No, we're doing really great.
[275:52.93]Alright, okay.
[275:53.79]Happy to be here.
[275:54.43]Very cool.
[275:55.05]Oh, wait, actually, I do have a question.
[275:57.96]Could we do our grading a little earlier?
[276:00.66]Because I have my thing at 8.
[276:02.71]Yeah, so whoever has, we're going to just figure out who has to go in the next 40 minutes or so, 30 minutes.
[276:10.26]Okay.
[276:10.92]So we'll try to get everybody in.
[276:12.22]There's literally, you've got about 10 minutes.
[276:17.22]So we're at the 10 minute countdown right now.
[276:18.88]10 minutes.
[276:21.62]Okay.
[276:22.28]Good thing we're almost done.
[276:24.42]Yeah, there is at least three of you that need to go.
[276:26.92]So we'll make sure that everybody gets up.
[276:29.15]There's literally like 9 minutes, 12 minutes.
[276:32.78]Okay, sounds good.
[276:34.12]Thanks, dude.
[276:34.56]Okay, an important question to ask.
[276:43.35]I'm going to ask everybody here.
[276:45.35]Let's go into each room.
[276:46.27]I'll give them the 10 minute warning and ask if anybody has a really hard out.
[276:52.14]Oh, Snuffy, what you are doing is taking House Flipper into the future.
[276:56.02]Hello?
[276:56.42]I don't want to alarm anybody.
[276:57.91]I'm here.
[276:58.23]I'm giving you a 10-minute warning.
[277:00.59]Thank you.
[277:01.83]Does anybody here have a hard out?
[277:05.01]No.
[277:05.47]Okay.
[277:05.65]There's a few people that do, so I want to have them go first.
[277:09.38]Okay.
[277:09.90]Cool.
[277:10.86]Carry on.
[277:11.48]See you in, like, 10 minutes.
[277:13.42]Is that a fuck?
[277:15.42]Hi, guys.
[277:16.24]It's me.
[277:16.76]I'm here.
[277:17.28]Hey.
[277:17.96]Do any of you have a hard out?
[277:21.18]No, I think it would be best if we went last.
[277:24.08]Oh, are you sure?
[277:24.98]Because I want to.
[277:26.62]Yeah.
[277:27.46]Wait, why do you want to not go last?
[277:29.26]Because I kind of want to go for dinner.
[277:31.99]Oh.
[277:32.43]My family.
[277:32.93]We have to go to Aquarium.
[277:37.89]This is also a 10 minute warning.
[277:40.35]I'm down to go first.
[277:43.07]It's like, I guess everybody I've jumped into is besides the first group is like people have to go in like an hour or two.
[277:49.06]So.
[277:51.36]Let me see where I can put you guys.
[277:55.81]I'm down to go relatively early.
[277:57.45]Let's see who wants to go last.
[278:00.03]I'll go find that out.
[278:01.21]But 10 minute warning.
[278:02.51]Be back in a minute.
[278:03.85]I mean, sir, if you want to do it.
[278:06.92]Hello, I am here.
[278:08.16]I have a couple of important questions.
[278:09.36]Number one, this is the 10 minute warning.
[278:12.20]10 minute warning.
[278:14.58]And do either of you have to leave?
[278:18.29]Um, I'm
[278:19.61]Pretty okay, pulling a bit of a late night.
[278:22.73]We're committed to the House Flipper cars.
[278:24.89]Okay, because I'm trying to move people, because there are a few people that have to go in the next, like, hour?
[278:30.47]Next, like, 40 minutes to an hour, so I want them to go first.
[278:35.43]Yeah, that's fine.
[278:36.21]So we'll find out who has hard outs.
[278:37.87]There's at least two that we know of so far, so I will be back.
[278:40.23]10-minute warning.
[278:41.01]Good luck.
[278:41.83]Finish it up.
[278:42.61]Thanks, man.

[279:23.62]See you guys very soon.
[279:24.60]Yeah.
[279:27.55]Hello, Squeaks.
[279:28.31]How are you?
[279:28.93]Hello.
[279:29.55]I'm doing great.
[279:31.37]They have the 10 minute warning, but do you have anywhere to be?
[279:35.42]No, I'm good.
[279:36.82]I have no constraints.
[279:39.84]There's a few people that need to go relatively soon, so I'm going to try to get them through first.
[279:44.70]Yeah, they can cut me or whatever if they need to present earlier.
[279:47.62]You're the man.
[279:48.60]Thanks, dude.
[279:49.56]See you soon.
[279:50.00]You're welcome.
[279:50.90]See ya.
[279:53.14]Hey, what's going on, Connor?
[279:55.40]I'm trying to get new photos in, and the photos, they're just not appearing in the game anymore.
[280:01.99]You may have hit the asset limit.
[280:03.51]I don't know.
[280:04.86]I mean, it's not like that many photos.
[280:07.32]I don't even know what happened.
[280:08.32]Maybe if you save the game and exit and come back and make sure you save it.
[280:11.05]Yeah, I tried that and it didn't fix it either.
[280:13.35]Do you have anywhere to be?
[280:15.81]Do you have to go in the next hour or something?
[280:17.29]I'm going to be honest with you.
[280:18.43]You might as well let me go first.
[280:20.83]The photo I would have added is not going to add to the score or subtract from it.
[280:24.73]There's not much more to create here.
[280:27.87]This needs to be showcased soon and moved on.
[280:30.77]Okay.
[280:34.61]I'm ready.
[280:35.51]Okay.
[280:35.99]So I will put you... Are you talking about you're like not even... How long would it take to go through yours?
[280:44.46]As long as it needs.
[280:45.40]Two minutes?
[280:46.10]Three?
[280:46.38]Okay.
[280:47.62]Alright.
[280:49.26]We'll get you up there early.
[280:50.14]Alright.
[280:52.14]I think I go first anyways.
[280:53.91]Yeah, I'm moving people around because Esfan and Bonnie have to leave.
[280:58.59]Doug Doug's got to leave.
[281:00.55]Some people have hard outs, so I'm trying to move people around.
[281:03.61]But whoever doesn't have a hard out, then I'm going to try to get through these pretty quickly.
[281:07.75]Alright.
[281:09.21]Cool, cool.
[281:09.87]See you soon.
[281:10.69]By the way, this is like the nine-minute warning, eight-minute warning.
[281:13.61]Oh, okay.
[281:14.11]So you're within about ten minutes.
[281:16.19]Alright.
[281:16.41]You're going to get screamed at by a mod.
[281:18.73]Alright.
[281:19.19]Alright.
[281:19.55]See you soon, dude.
[281:19.94]See you.
[281:23.58]Hello, you two.
[281:25.04]This is the official you are within 10 minutes.
[281:27.92]There's only seven minutes remaining.
[281:29.88]Okay, copy.
[281:31.72]And I know, Doug, you have a hard out, so we will make sure you guys get to go within the first two.
[281:35.68]Probably the first, yeah.
[281:38.69]I will probably... Actually, nine minutes.
[281:41.77]How long do you think each tour is going to be?
[281:43.39]Probably 10 minutes.
[281:44.87]Okay, I can probably... And also, too, like, Lud, you could do the tour, too.
[281:49.11]Like, if people have to go... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[281:50.61]Yeah, yeah.
[281:51.98]Cool, cool.
[281:52.66]About seven minutes?
[281:53.86]Appreciate it.
[281:58.42]Hello, we are officially at about six and a half minutes remaining.
[282:02.01]We are within ten minutes.
[282:03.13]You're getting close.
[282:05.41]We had a crash.
[282:06.27]Does that give us any additional time?
[282:07.63]Oh, you crashed?
[282:08.79]Yeah.
[282:09.05]Yeah, we actually did crash.
[282:10.29]How much time did you guys lose?
[282:12.43]I would say just like a few minutes.
[282:14.21]Okay.
[282:15.40]Yeah, if you guys lost like five minutes?
[282:19.27]yeah at least five minutes or like like seven luckily it did auto save but it was still like the crash reload and that's good that's good but do either one of you have to have a hard out no I'll be here
[282:35.56]That was so begrudging.
[282:36.62]Because we know we're last.
[282:38.26]Yeah, we'll know we'll be here for a minute.
[282:40.02]Well, no, I think.
[282:42.60]It's fine.
[282:43.46]Because we're getting up to the clock where people have to leave.
[282:46.08]And I'm just trying to make sure that people that have hard outs.
[282:50.17]Got to save the best for last, you know.
[282:51.93]Hey, you were second place last time.
[282:54.07]What was I?
[282:56.09]What was I?
[282:56.59]I don't know.
[282:59.53]Fifth?
[283:00.23]Sixth?
[283:01.84]seventh that's not bad that's fine out of eight you're good stop you're fine alright alright but yeah uh we're gonna get started here about five minutes six minutes uh you guys could like you guys can keep going for five minutes yeah yeah okay because you guys crashed that's fine use the honor system I'm sure chat's gonna keep you honest anyways oh I mean we have it recorded we have evidence but it actually recovered
[283:28.50]um the build so very good cool alright let's scoot over here I will see you guys in about five minutes that's good okay so we are at the one the good thing about having teams is one person can give the tour if somebody's got to go that's all good your your partner knows what you're doing and has contributed so they can give the tour
[283:59.29]But we're at the wrap it up.
[284:00.77]We're at the wrap up the build phase.
[284:04.35]It's time to wrap it up.
[284:06.99]Mine doesn't count because I lost like 48 minutes of time.
[284:10.75]That's not fair.
[284:16.14]Timer's frozen.
[284:16.96]The timer's only going by minutes.
[284:21.90]I think it's because it added because of the hour.
[284:24.14]There we go.
[284:24.56]If I do this.
[284:27.10]Yeah, it's because once the hour kicked over, it was been cropped up.
[284:35.46]You had 20 hours in the game?
[284:41.01]Yeah.
[284:41.73]I'm answering a bunch of phone calls.
[284:47.23]Wait, where do you... Who told you I have 20 hours in House Flipper 2?
[284:50.48]Where'd you get that info?
[284:56.70]Can we score you?
[284:59.78]Nah.
[285:04.82]Whoa, this is not right.
[285:06.48]Why is this here?
[285:09.70]Let me at least finish the second floor.
[285:17.73]This is so cool, though.
[285:20.57]I'm looking forward to just cleaning stuff.
[285:26.16]I'm excited.
[285:27.08]Okay.
[285:29.68]We're under three minutes.
[285:30.94]Just getting there.
[285:31.48]I need to remove these walls.
[285:42.67]Cool.
[285:48.07]Alright, I gotta just prepare a little.
[285:49.63]I gotta make sure I'm over here.
[285:50.89]Make sure I'm ready to talk.
[285:52.91]Make sure I'm ready to go into my browser.
[285:54.28]Save this for later.
[285:56.18]If anyone wants to look at it, you can.
[285:58.00]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[286:00.60]I'm gonna delete some of these because I think they're taking a while to load on the browser.
[286:06.80]But I have the files, so it's not like they're gone forever.
[286:09.80]But I'm gonna get rid of some of these to free up some space.
[286:12.56]We're getting to be about two minutes.
[286:21.34]It looks like a face.
[286:22.02]It kind of does.
[286:22.84]Alright, let's delete some of these.
[286:25.79]It looks like Pinocchio.
[286:30.91]It kind of does.
[286:31.43]I'm going to put this on screen too so we can kind of figure out who should go immediately.
[286:38.01]You need to put one JPEG up.
[286:50.40]Uh...
[286:54.18]No, I'm out of time.
[286:56.20]I gotta start to prepare this.
[287:00.01]Yeah, I'll put face cam back on.
[287:08.11]It's gonna crash, but whatever.
[287:10.05]It's gonna crash.
[287:17.77]Nice pirate.
[287:19.09]Should I get like an eye patch?
[287:20.75]Put an eye patch on?
[287:24.05]Get this out of the way.
[287:30.22]One minute remaining.
[287:34.96]One minute remaining.
[287:46.28]You look like a swashbuckler.
[287:48.80]You look like a sword.
[287:57.77]30 seconds.
[287:59.71]30 seconds.
[288:00.20]Wait, we're giving people extra 30 seconds because it didn't say my timer is longer or shorter or whatever.
[288:12.17]They'll have some time.
[288:12.87]Squeaks is going to still go for another few minutes, though.
[288:26.53]You can do file explorer and delete from there.
[288:28.27]Oh shit.
[288:28.61]That's good to know.
[288:29.95]That's not gonna crash my game, right?
[288:31.15]Alright, here we go.
[288:31.77]Three, two, one.
[288:33.90]That is it.
[288:34.70]It's been 90 minutes.
[288:36.04]90 minutes has elapsed.
[288:40.22]I'm putting it away.
[288:41.70]Oh, we got pulled up.
[288:42.78]We got pulled into the room.
[288:44.79]Oh, we're going to spoil it.
[288:46.31]Oh,
[288:47.31]That's it.
[288:48.13]One hour and 30 minutes.
[288:49.21]10 seconds.
[288:51.49]10 seconds.
[288:53.33]Whatever you're doing, whatever's on the pot, Ster it and pull it off.
[288:57.77]Let me get the file for you.
[288:59.42]Ster it and pull it off.
[289:01.54]Ster it.
[289:02.90]Wait.
[289:03.64]I'm stirring.
[289:05.02]Ster it and then pull me off.
[289:06.80]Main door's open.
[289:10.18]I'll resave.
[289:11.50]It's not on my screen, though.
[289:14.64]You have 10 minutes.
[289:15.40]Oh, you're right.
[289:15.90]It was in my game.
[289:16.82]Sorry.
[289:18.52]We have 10 minutes?
[289:19.66]To do the build.
[289:20.86]To do the tour.
[289:23.62]Oh, okay.
[289:24.38]I keep saying hard out, but it's in my brain today.
[289:27.61]10-minute tours, 10 to 12.
[289:30.81]The first ones were about 3 to 5, so you will have more time.
[289:35.23]But I do want to be courteous.
[289:37.61]Let's get moving right now because there's at least a few people here that got to get out of here.
[289:41.27]So, DougDoug, you got to go, like, right now, right?
[289:49.30]That's right, Chef.
[289:49.86]Yes, Chef.
[289:50.60]I got to go in, yeah, 15 minutes.
[289:52.92]It's alright, though.
[289:53.54]Lud can present if somebody else has to go.
[289:55.70]S-Fan, when do you have to go?
[289:57.96]I have a thing I have to say.
[289:59.88]I have a sponsor date.
[290:01.33]Okay, so you should... S-Fan and Bonnie, you guys should go first.
[290:05.31]Okay.
[290:05.87]Okay.
[290:06.95]Because if you don't go first, then I don't think we'll be able to see yours.
[290:10.43]So let's do you guys first.
[290:12.45]Snap it out.
[290:13.90]And then, so at about 5.55...
[290:18.51]Doug, if you're still here to like kind of do the intro.
[290:20.91]I'll do the first couple minutes.
[290:22.27]I'll let Ludwig carry it home.
[290:24.09]Yeah.
[290:24.51]Cool.
[290:24.85]Alright.

[291:06.83]This came down to the goddamn wire.
[291:08.61]I can't believe it, but... The ultimate mind games, you'll see.
[291:12.29]You should see it now.
[291:13.75]I'm excited.
[291:14.19]Right.
[291:15.43]And... I see Jerma stream.
[291:17.47]There it is.
[291:18.08]Can you all see it?
[291:19.24]I can see it, yeah.
[291:20.06]Alright, so let me do... Can I do filter like new?
[291:24.28]Okay, so where are you?
[291:26.20]What did I just put it in?
[291:26.86]Where'd it go?
[291:27.28]Oh, okay.
[291:29.02]So there's different worlds.
[291:33.65]I did not check if the...
[291:36.20]Jason double um the problem with the the file thing works um you'll see it in in Vinny's thing so I suppose did it not go in I think it is at the bottom because this is crayfish coast I think it might be if you scroll down possibly I think I might have seen it let's see if it pops up here which it should uh oh there it is okay yeah I thought it's an Etalyx that's my bad
[292:07.04]Alright, I am opening it, and here we go.
[292:10.06]I'm going to restart my can.
[292:11.74]It's going to be sweet.
[292:12.62]I'm not looking at anything.
[292:13.74]I am not looking at anything.
[292:15.02]I'm just going... I'm just flying over to the entrance.
[292:18.33]I'm imagining.
[292:18.89]I don't know where the entrance is.
[292:19.93]Am I going the right way?
[292:21.63]Well, you're scrolling through Ram Ranch right now.
[292:24.09]No, I'm just kidding.
[292:24.55]There wasn't a Ram Ranch.
[292:25.53]But we wanted to add a Ram Ranch, but we couldn't.
[292:28.17]Oh.
[292:28.45]Here we go.
[292:29.64]Ram Ranch.
[292:30.40]No, you're doing good.
[292:31.42]Just keep following the... Just keep going.
[292:35.10]So am I in a good spot?
[292:38.97]Actually, yes.
[292:40.17]But I would turn to the left and then turn to the right whenever you start.
[292:44.35]So start.
[292:44.71]No, no, no.
[292:45.77]No, sorry.
[292:47.27]Your left, not my left.
[292:48.13]Right?
[292:51.23]Right.
[292:51.49]Other left.
[292:52.33]Other left.
[292:53.43]Alright.
[292:56.47]Are you ready?
[292:56.97]Let's go for it.
[292:58.15]Good luck.
[292:58.81]I'm excited.
[293:00.09]Esfand and Bonnie, let's see the presentation.
[293:01.65]You got 10 minutes.
[293:02.33]Let's go.
[293:02.99]Okay.
[293:05.04]Okay, so you can go ahead and keep walking here.
[293:08.99]Okay.
[293:10.77]And you can turn to the right here.
[293:13.37]This is our house that we built.
[293:15.24]I hope you enjoy it.
[293:18.57]Oh, shit.
[293:19.43]Okay.
[293:20.17]Alright.
[293:21.01]It's a little bit bigger.
[293:22.27]It might not be perfectly to scale.
[293:25.05]This is like the mansion style.
[293:31.72]We realized while putting in the furniture that it wasn't quite to scale.
[293:39.68]It's like a warehouse.
[293:43.14]but uh yeah it was uh you know we we we tried really hard to make it as much as possible uh accurate this is this is great I love this you can just explore honestly okay cool let me let me I'm gonna go in the front door okay oh this was the front door oh well the side door yeah okay
[294:05.37]We might have taken some liberties, creative liberties.
[294:08.09]Right, because we didn't know what was behind certain walls.
[294:11.11]We didn't know, so we just kind of added our own, you know.
[294:14.94]Imagine watching that TV from over here.
[294:19.94]So we actually borrowed that couch from Will Neff.
[294:27.08]Yeah, so that's not the same couch from the Dollhouse stream.
[294:30.12]It's a different couch that we got from Will Neff earlier.
[294:31.96]Oh, okay.
[294:33.43]yeah but uh so we had to use that one I mean obviously I'm gonna have this up there this has to be up there obviously yeah that wasn't at all awesome uh I like the window I love these little bit and you figured out the windows you figured the windows out that's perfect yeah we we figured out windows and we figured out how to recolor the doors and stuff but we never found out curtains
[295:02.36]Oh, look at that.
[295:03.00]I found Ken.
[295:08.25]So actually, so this picture of... Holly just laughed really loud.
[295:11.51]I don't know if you heard that.
[295:14.19]The picture of you on the right is actually only like half real.
[295:18.47]We AI generated like the second half of this.
[295:20.81]What?
[295:21.76]In case you couldn't tell.
[295:22.66]Yeah, we threw that in Photoshop.
[295:26.10]AI generated the bottom half.
[295:27.88]Yeah, it actually made you taller.
[295:29.55]I was going to say something looked off about this and I didn't know what it was.
[295:33.53]What's in my hand?
[295:35.47]Eyelash curlers, maybe.
[295:38.21]It looks like a ripped up water bottle.
[295:40.17]Yeah, it looks like an old crinkled up water bottle.
[295:44.30]Okay, cool.
[295:44.72]I like this.
[295:45.22]This is great.
[295:48.58]And then here's the kitchen.
[295:50.57]I love this.
[295:51.87]You're getting extra points because of how huge this is.
[295:54.65]It's perfect.
[295:55.83]Thank you.
[295:56.27]This is how big the dollhouse should have been.
[295:58.51]Right, yeah.
[295:59.41]It should have been like two Walmarts.
[296:02.57]Yeah.
[296:03.61]Okay, cool.
[296:04.07]We got a little pool outside too.
[296:07.61]Wait, hold on.
[296:08.07]Is it AI generated?
[296:09.95]This one's the real one.
[296:11.13]Oh, okay.
[296:13.01]No, you just look like that.
[296:15.87]Pool, love it.

[296:51.71]So this is a bedroom.
[296:53.03]We didn't have that much to add in this room.
[296:57.72]It wasn't very much in this room anyways, right?
[296:59.66]Yeah, there wasn't really.
[297:02.60]Very cool.
[297:05.42]Yep, this is the DIY room, right?
[297:09.45]Cool.
[297:10.61]So you can use that box.
[297:12.15]I tried to get the bigger box, but that was the biggest box I could find.
[297:17.74]Love it.
[297:18.52]We didn't know what was in this room So in this this is the safe was back here it was like the thing you knocked out There's another door and we didn't know it was in here.

[297:42.23]Is that what's happening?

[297:48.85]What?
[297:49.21]What is it?
[297:50.43]Toilet paper rolls?
[297:53.99]Oh my god, that's so scary.
[297:57.37]Okay, cool.
[297:58.53]This is the AI one, right?
[298:00.77]What is all... What are all the urns of the sacrifices?
[298:04.17]This is your old body being sacrificed so that the new, more superior Jerma could arise based off of all the sacrifices of all the bad chatters that have ever been in your chat before, which aren't very many, actually, because your chat's actually very nice.
[298:19.08]They can be nice.
[298:19.84]They can be nice.
[298:21.22]I'm about to see the new superior you.
[298:23.75]Very cool.
[298:25.81]Well, I love it.
[298:27.75]I love it.
[298:30.98]Yeah.
[298:31.56]So, uh, yeah, we, we did our best.
[298:34.86]I think we learned a lot today actually on how House Flipper works.
[298:38.34]Uh, let me get like a big, I want to see like the whole thing from the side.
[298:42.80]Well, I'll tell you, you're being graded.
[298:44.37]You have, you have a few different grades.
[298:46.03]There's Creativity, Philosophy, Structural Integrity, and Chats Grade.
[298:52.51]So I can tell you right now, if we open up the grading system, let me just get like a nice one more good view.
[298:57.53]So, creativity-wise, I'm going to give you guys a B+, because I feel like it.
[299:04.15]And, you know, you're working to the host.
[299:09.62]That's perfect.
[299:10.24]That's perfect.
[299:12.56]Actually, I'll give you philosophy for B+.
[299:15.50]Creativity, I'm going to give you a B. Structural integrity...
[299:21.29]is gonna be a little bit lower considering that the rooms are are very big uh they're a lot bigger than than I had in here in the dollhouse uh so I'm gonna have to give you I'm gonna have to give you a um it's gonna be pretty it's a but you guys did just start playing the game two hours ago
[299:43.83]I'm going to give you a, I'll give you, I'm going to give you, I'm going to give you a C minus for the structural.
[299:49.81]Okay.

[301:49.32]77, perfect grade.
[301:51.34]I got a D plus in high school math.
[301:56.27]I think I failed every time.
[302:00.32]Just every time for everything?
[302:03.24]There was a point in school where I would just write my name on the top of the math paper and nothing else.
[302:09.69]That's sad.
[302:10.45]That's defeat.
[302:11.27]I just couldn't do it.
[302:14.25]Hey, I got better.
[302:14.85]I improved.
[302:16.19]Yeah.
[302:16.75]And that's, I mean, I think that's some of the joys and stuff.
[302:18.55]It's like stuff you, you know, you feel like you can't get over, figure out, you know, just keep climbing up.
[302:23.40]It's true.
[302:25.24]Alright.
[302:25.72]I am uploading.
[302:27.90]Are you importing?
[302:29.30]Oh, shit.
[302:29.58]I picked the wrong one.
[302:31.13]Let me get this off so people don't get spoiled.
[302:35.41]We don't want that.
[302:36.08]Okay.
[302:44.28]Alright, you should spawn into a small room.
[302:47.72]Spawn into a room?
[302:48.76]In a small room?
[302:49.90]Yeah.
[302:50.62]Just keep your face totally still if it's worked.
[302:52.98]Yeah, but I'm not going to look.
[302:55.30]So just make sure I'm in the right spot.
[302:57.11]And if I'm not in the right spot, literally just pretend like you're playing the game through me.
[303:01.07]Copy.
[303:02.45]Yeah, that one right there.
[303:03.61]this one right here.

[305:49.02]So before you open it, I know the entry to our house isn't that fancy, but it's only up from here.
[305:54.66]Okay.
[305:56.10]Go ahead.
[305:59.50]Oh my God.
[306:01.54]You guys.
[306:05.52]No way.
[306:07.00]So this is the living room.
[306:08.28]You're going to notice we set it up with your standard furniture, such as the sofa, the living room, desk and table.
[306:15.91]You're going to see a lovely rug, a nice TV.
[306:17.87]Go ahead and just peruse everything we set up in this main room.
[306:21.01]So should I play?
[306:22.95]Yeah, you could fly through it all, but I would recommend taking your time, you know, enjoying the scenery.
[306:27.63]And remember, you do have a shift.
[306:30.18]Yeah, it looks like our interior designing team did put a little distance.
[306:35.01]There you go.
[306:35.37]Yeah, very easy.
[306:36.57]Okay, should I go in here or should I try to go up there?
[306:39.93]Go in there.
[306:40.67]Well, how are you going to get to there, you know?
[306:42.13]Our house is kind of a straight line.
[306:44.09]You're going to have to sort of follow along the path.
[306:46.19]Okay.
[306:46.99]Got in.
[306:47.53]Oh, wow.
[306:49.27]Welcome to the bathroom, Jerma.
[306:50.42]Shit.
[306:50.96]I lost.
[306:55.16]It's alright.
[306:55.56]Lakitu just put me back up.
[306:56.76]I'm good.
[306:58.71]Welcome to our bathroom.
[307:00.57]The bathroom's got your standard decorations.
[307:02.53]We've got a lovely PewDiePie bathtub that you're looking towards.
[307:05.23]Towels that you can pick up along the way for it.
[307:07.86]Standard sink, toilet, plunger, shampoo.
[307:12.42]The toilet paper rolls are very small, so watch your step.
[307:16.54]And just as a heads up, generally, it's much more below you than you'd expect.
[307:22.43]Oh, shit, I fell.
[307:24.43]Okay, well, I'll tell you right now, creativity, this is through the roof.
[307:27.83]Like, this is unbelievably through the roof.
[307:31.67]Now, I do have kind of a bet going with my chat of whether you will fall more or less than 20 times as you explore our house.
[307:37.36]Oh, okay.
[307:38.58]So that was at least, like, five.
[307:39.72]Okay, so... We're at three, but for my channel's sake, let's keep it single digits.
[307:44.60]Okay.
[307:45.32]A lot of channel points riding on it.
[307:47.49]So I'm heading over here, right?
[307:49.25]Yep, that's right, yeah.
[307:50.11]Ooh, okay, the Jerm has skipped.
[307:52.03]That's never been done before.
[307:54.51]And welcome to the office.
[307:55.20]Welcome to the recreation room.
[307:56.30]Yeah, rec room.
[307:57.58]Cool.
[307:59.82]This room's fun because you get two paths.
[308:01.98]Is that right, Doug?
[308:03.36]If you're more of a gamer, then you might want to head to the right.
[308:05.62]We've got the pool table, the chess board, and we've got some weights for you.
[308:09.47]But if you're more inclined to music and working out, the left path might be better for you.
[308:14.93]Man, okay.
[308:16.39]I'm going to go this way.
[308:19.53]Okay, I had a lot of channel points riding on that.
[308:21.62]Excellent choice, sir.
[308:22.60]Excellent choice.
[308:26.76]Okay.
[308:29.22]I'm pretty sure you're in.
[308:34.86]Okay.
[308:35.30]Doesn't count as a fall, though.
[308:36.63]Very well done.
[308:37.89]And that was the first door clip.
[308:41.85]Actually, I think we are seeing new speed run stress developed in real time.
[308:45.51]Welcome to the garden.
[308:46.51]We've been doing a little exterior decorating.
[308:48.53]Wanted to make sure that we had some lovely nature fixtures as well.
[308:51.65]Home's not complete without a garden.
[308:53.39]No, absolutely not.
[308:56.26]Oh, sorry.
[308:56.64]We meant to remove that stump.
[308:58.54]Couldn't get the landscape.
[308:59.44]Hey, this is good for me.
[309:00.92]It's a good spot for me to jump.
[309:04.02]Oh, double plant skip.
[309:05.76]Ooh.
[309:08.17]I just walk up that palm tree.
[309:10.55]Oh, there's a hitbox on the palm tree.
[309:12.09]Yep, going to have to head to the side.
[309:13.75]Yeah, got to go to those hedges.
[309:15.41]Well trimmed.
[309:19.05]Anyone have fall count?
[309:21.69]Got to be at like eight.
[309:23.03]I don't know what you call that one.
[309:25.21]Miraculous.
[309:25.89]Oh, this is the one.
[309:28.21]I got screwed over by the door.
[309:29.81]Screwed up by the door.
[309:31.07]There are two doors.
[309:35.46]Don't backseat game the streamer.
[309:37.46]You're right.
[309:41.30]Game designers, why are the doors opening this way?
[309:45.41]How am I supposed to do this?
[309:46.69]It's a great question, Doug, and our answer to that.
[309:49.19]It's more of a puzzle.
[309:50.15]It's a puzzle.
[309:50.95]You close the left one, right?
[309:53.05]You have to sort of think about how to open it in a strategic way.
[309:56.13]But we don't like to tell the player how to play.
[309:57.71]We like the player to tell us how to play, you know?
[310:01.13]We'll fix that in a patch.
[310:05.88]Whoa!
[310:06.78]What's going on?
[310:10.10]What?
[310:11.32]Wait.
[310:12.72]Oh, you're on the palm tree.
[310:13.76]You flew to the palm tree.
[310:14.52]Oh, I'm on the palm tree.
[310:15.60]Okay.
[310:16.56]I was wondering what happened.
[310:18.86]Oh, shit.
[310:19.44]Thank you, DougDoug.
[310:20.10]That's a great idea.
[310:22.28]Okay.
[310:23.18]Look at that.
[310:23.66]We're going to add achievements in the next patch, but an achievement would pop up right there of you solve the door puzzle.
[310:29.05]Door puzzle succeeded.
[310:31.61]And welcome to our kitchen.
[310:34.03]Bon appetit.
[310:38.23]I like the pizza.
[310:39.34]I love how this all has collision, too.
[310:41.71]And Chad, if you're enjoying this, it will be available on Steam for $29.99.
[310:43.87]Is that right, Doug?
[310:46.64]Ooh, almost got me with that one.
[310:48.46]Whoa.
[310:49.90]Okay, this is one of the harder ones.
[310:53.58]Ooh, misses the closet.
[310:55.04]It's such a little lip, isn't it?
[310:56.28]Oh.
[310:57.66]Alright, am I flying?
[311:02.10]No.
[311:04.83]Ooh, this one is rough.
[311:06.23]This one's tricky.
[311:07.39]It's tough.
[311:08.73]Tough but doable.
[311:09.99]Strong but firm.
[311:12.56]Ooh, I keep hitting my head.
[311:13.62]I didn't necessarily do this successfully, but it's almost certainly doable.
[311:18.35]No, no, we did it.
[311:18.79]We did it.
[311:19.55]Oh, did the designers complete the whole level?
[311:22.07]Oh, the designers complete... Ten times over.
[311:24.21]Ten times over, you know, with different strategies.
[311:26.61]But, you know, at any point, feel free to just... Oh, I thought that was it.
[311:33.94]Got it.
[311:34.44]Oh, it is doable.
[311:35.44]We did test it.
[311:36.12]You're right.
[311:36.94]We did.
[311:37.56]God, we're good.
[311:38.58]Alright, here we are.
[311:39.18]And this is mine and Doug Doug's bedroom.
[311:41.99]Cool.
[311:43.39]I got bottom bunk.
[311:45.03]That's kind of how it goes in our place.
[311:49.33]Shit, that was so... You're the fool for crazy skips.
[311:52.06]I tried to skip too much.
[311:53.30]There's no need to rush, even though I have to leave in two minutes.
[311:55.62]Yeah, even though you're out of here in like 60 seconds.
[311:58.86]You're probably like, come on, man.
[312:01.00]Take your time, baby, alright?
[312:03.11]Oh, fuck, that one's hard.
[312:07.29]There you go.
[312:11.73]There we go.
[312:12.01]There we go.
[312:13.21]Alright.
[312:13.97]And congratulations on passing through the bedroom.
[312:16.52]Now, you are heading up into the attic, and we actually have three different doors that you can pick, three paths, if you will, that dictate the ending of your game experience.
[312:24.22]What do you choose?
[312:24.80]This is unbelievable.
[312:25.54]The path on the left is the hard path.
[312:28.82]The path in the middle is the path of bravery.
[312:30.74]And the path on the right is the path of least resistance.
[312:33.63]I just want to see what's in there.
[312:38.91]Oh, it just goes down.
[312:41.72]I'm going to pick the middle one.
[312:44.28]Excellent choice.
[312:45.52]The middle one leads to one of the most climactic endings to any video game that you will have ever seen.
[312:50.18]Before you go over the lip of this, be sure to look down.
[312:52.62]We have a bit of a surprise for you, Jerma.
[312:54.50]It turns out that the physics in this game do something very interesting if you fall directly onto a trampoline from this height.
[313:02.72]What?
[313:08.10]It bounces two feet.
[313:10.00]Whoa.
[313:11.38]And that's the ending of Doug and Ludwig's Only Up.
[313:14.70]Wow.
[313:15.36]Mostly up.
[313:15.90]Mostly up.
[313:16.52]Holy shit.
[313:18.27]Creativity through the roof.
[313:19.37]Philosophy through the roof.
[313:22.61]And a lot of structural integrity, if I do say so myself.
[313:26.39]I really don't want to give you this, but I think you guys have to get a 100 for structural integrity.
[313:32.73]That is a 100.
[313:34.52]Out of 100.
[313:35.34]Out of 100.
[313:35.52]For structural integrity.
[313:37.72]That's what I'm thinking, too.
[313:39.00]Philosophy, this is very... I mean, creativity is... Oh, I hate to have to... But you can't give somebody a 10.
[313:47.64]I mean, you can give somebody a 10.
[313:50.49]Yeah, you can, but... The great thing is it's Jerma's House Flipper Invitational, so you can do what you want.
[313:57.73]I'm going to give you your creativity 98%.
[314:03.99]And I'm going to give your philosophy.
[314:07.34]It's just, it's, it's, this is just, this is great.
[314:09.40]Like making like a video game in this, like, come on, that's unbelievable.
[314:14.18]Um, and actually like working, this is like, I love it.
[314:17.50]I loved it.
[314:18.68]Uh, I'm going to give you a, I'll give you enough.
[314:21.91]Let's go straight up.
[314:22.55]94 philosophy.
[314:24.41]94.
[314:25.57]Thanks.
[314:25.95]You guys absolutely killed it.
[314:27.87]Thank you so much.
[314:28.71]Chef has given you a 95.
[314:29.77]Alright.
[314:31.09]Thank you, Chad.
[314:33.74]Uh, can we go next?
[314:34.62]Me and Ster?
[314:36.08]Yeah, does anybody else need to get out of here immediately?
[314:38.50]Or are we good?
[314:41.44]Oak and Ster can go next if they need to get out of here.
[314:43.44]I know Connor needs to... I think Connor Eats Pants has to go.
[314:46.60]Can we go one after?
[314:49.15]So he can go first on ours.
[314:51.25]So Conrad's pants, you said you wanted to get yours done quickly.
[314:54.55]Yeah.
[314:55.23]So hey, Doug, Doug, and Ludwig, before you go, thanks for doing this.
[314:58.25]It was awesome.
[314:58.81]Thanks for hanging out.
[314:59.33]Thanks so much for having us.
[315:00.25]Super fun.
[315:00.67]Good luck, everybody.
[315:01.35]Appreciate it.
[315:01.85]And your final grade is... So I give 98 for creativity.
[315:07.88]And your final grade...
[315:10.51]is going to be, you're at 95.49.
[315:12.15]You're at 95.5.
[315:15.58]That's pretty damn fucking good.
[315:17.52]Thank you so much.
[315:19.26]Alright, Connor, let's get you in here.
[315:20.46]Thank you guys so much.
[315:21.28]I know we're moving people quickly, but it was a pleasure.
[315:24.17]You guys are awesome.
[315:24.95]Thanks for coming out.
[315:25.59]Thank you, Jerma.
[315:26.11]Thank you.
[315:26.79]Thanks, everybody.
[315:27.25]Bye, Doug.
[315:27.85]Thank you, Doug.
[315:28.77]Alright, Connor.
[315:32.60]Let's get you in here.
[315:34.83]So this was Connor's, well, not me, Connor, other Connor's creation.
[315:39.07]It was his idea.
[315:40.13]It kind of took the reins to start.
[315:43.66]And, you know, I sort of put some finishing touches on it.
[315:46.54]But it's beautiful.
[315:48.44]Okay.
[315:48.56]You're going to love it.
[315:50.16]So you said that you think you can get through this, you said, in like two minutes.
[315:54.11]Yeah, I mean, there's not much to, you know, you'll see.
[315:57.31]Okay.
[315:59.18]I'm excited and nervous at the same time.
[316:00.92]We'll see.
[316:02.34]We worked really hard.
[316:03.06]Okay.
[316:03.48]Let me get it in there and we will get started.
[316:21.82]Also, people that are asking, they did not have to build a house.
[316:26.85]So like the whole house, like the first two were pre-built houses.
[316:29.86]Yeah.
[316:30.52]But that, this one was just, you can make anything you want.
[316:34.70]Make whatever, whatever, make whatever house, home, activity.
[316:39.82]It just, it's build is a fun build.
[316:41.92]Okay.
[316:43.16]But explain structural integrity.
[316:45.76]I mean, they, to make that work.
[316:48.51]You know how many, you know how many times I had to put the fishing rod and collision in the right spot for me to even be able to do that?
[316:52.97]That's unbelievable.
[316:54.69]Alright, so let me get yours in.
[316:56.03]We're good.
[316:56.45]I just got it.
[316:57.77]Alright, this is Team Connor's build.
[317:01.99]I have no idea what I'm about to watch.
[317:10.64]I'll explain what it is once you open it and you get a glimpse initially.
[317:16.32]Yeah, I think some of these bigger builds are... Okay, so you are... Here you are.
[317:24.20]Uh, which one is it?
[317:27.51]Um, oh, there you go.
[317:29.23]I'm not going to look.
[317:31.05]Tell me if I'm in the right spot.
[317:33.63]Oh, DougDougRaid, what's up?
[317:35.23]Hello, everybody.
[317:35.91]You can run outside really quick.
[317:37.05]Yep.
[317:37.15]There you go, and then go up front to the left.
[317:39.79]To the left?
[317:41.15]Yeah.
[317:41.37]This is the front over here?
[317:42.19]Okay.
[317:43.59]I am looking, like, at the sky right now.
[317:45.87]Yep, and you can land right there and get going.
[317:48.81]Alright, let me get this reset.
[317:55.68]And in three, two... Does it work?
[318:04.89]Hello?
[318:05.41]Oh, sorry.
[318:05.89]This thing was... There we go.
[318:07.37]Okay.
[318:08.31]I am ready, Connor.
[318:10.09]Give me the tool.
[318:10.49]Alright.
[318:11.47]This is the funeral home for Connor and I. You're at our funeral.
[318:17.25]Okay.
[318:18.75]You can turn around.
[318:22.14]This is the funeral home.
[318:26.12]We've built a nice little porch patio.
[318:31.97]Some trees.
[318:35.19]Here's our photo.
[318:37.31]I love that it's very slightly off.
[318:40.59]Like you're a little bit higher than he is.
[318:44.69]Yeah.
[318:45.25]You think that's off.
[318:46.03]You just wait until you see the rest of this.
[318:47.68]Oh, no.
[318:48.24]Okay.
[318:48.74]Should I open the door or do you want me to see anything else out here?
[318:51.24]Go on in.
[318:51.82]Go on in.
[318:56.42]Alright, so this is, this is the funeral home.
[319:01.56]Why are the pews so far up?
[319:03.86]Um, well, you know.
[319:06.25]Alright, where should I start?
[319:09.41]Not every funeral home, let's just say.
[319:10.65]I mean, you can just walk around.
[319:12.39]Look around wherever.
[319:13.19]So you got, like, the pews.
[319:16.07]There's our coffins up there, too.
[319:17.91]Oh, these are your coffins.
[319:20.01]Yes.
[319:20.33]That's, that's, there's, like, a toolbox over there.
[319:24.58]That, that was placed by Connor.
[319:25.88]Connor.
[319:27.74]Any idea of what his intentions were?
[319:29.68]No, I saw that and I was like, I'll get to that later.
[319:32.95]Didn't get to it later, so that's still there.
[319:35.15]But I guess if you need tools, they're there.
[319:37.67]I put like a melee setup in the back too, like the front right corner of the room.
[319:41.02]Yeah, over there.
[319:43.02]We put that there just because I was like, oh, it'd be fun and a toothbrush.
[319:47.51]That was just a little creative.
[319:48.57]So people come in at the funeral to play Smash at your funeral.
[319:54.55]Right, so that was just a little creative exercise I thought I'd put in the corner.
[319:57.71]There is something more in there, but I think we should do that last, which is the hole in the ground that leads to hell.
[320:06.15]Oh shit, okay.
[320:07.63]Oh my god, alright.
[320:08.37]We'll worry about that later.
[320:09.67]You can walk outside and see what we've put outside first.
[320:13.31]um we have some trees that I placed because I found I searched tree in the tab menu and I found that you could place trees this looks great this is this is a good outdoor landscaping work this is good thank you yeah and you can check the back the back is where there's a grave that we've made back here
[320:33.68]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[320:34.80]The red road is just there.
[320:38.17]Just ignore that for now.
[320:41.67]It's kind of like the yellow brick road, but it's red.
[320:45.67]I love this because it looks like floam.
[320:48.69]Thank you.
[320:49.13]No, we were going for that.
[320:50.97]Should I follow this road?
[320:52.09]I think I'm going to follow this road.
[320:53.95]I mean, yeah, it actually kind of leads to where you want to go.
[320:57.08]Okay, cool.
[320:57.36]It's a bit of a blood river.
[320:58.40]Ooh, it was like a river of blood.
[321:01.24]Yeah.
[321:01.56]Okay.
[321:02.80]Then to your right there, right ahead, that looks to be, yeah, that is where we buried, where we are to be buried after the service.
[321:13.09]Okay.
[321:13.57]Is in that hole.
[321:14.89]Don't fall in it.
[321:16.33]You can look in there.
[321:17.07]I should look in it?
[321:17.65]What's in it?
[321:18.87]Just, you know.
[321:23.15]Wait, are they just going to dump you into the void?
[321:25.33]That's where we go, yeah.
[321:27.02]Okay.
[321:27.42]That's how we dispose of ours.
[321:29.46]Very cool.
[321:31.00]Yeah, you can go back in now and check out the slide to hell.
[321:34.98]The slide to hell?
[321:36.32]Mm-hmm.
[321:41.91]Yeah, so I think Connor's actually in the call.
[321:44.47]If Connor wants to unmute, and he's a bit busy though, but maybe he can explain really quickly the inspiration for hell on the home.
[321:55.83]Yeah, I don't know if you can hear me right now.
[321:57.33]I'm on a bullet train.
[322:00.15]No, you're good.
[322:00.61]We hear you loud and clear.
[322:02.15]Oh, yeah.
[322:03.83]Okay, good, good.
[322:04.67]I mean, I just had a final thought.
[322:09.32]The point is, is that we are living in a house.
[322:16.12]This is the situation we're building now.
[322:19.88]I don't find this very funny.
[322:23.41]I don't know why you're laughing.
[322:25.15]Why are you laughing?
[322:26.15]This is the most serious part of the build, actually.
[322:34.31]I'm laughing because you were calling in from a train, talking about like how you're both burning in hell in this house.
[322:42.13]That's okay.
[322:43.87]We're not burning in hell yet, to be fair.
[322:47.51]It's just, okay.
[322:48.70]That was fucking amazing.
[322:50.30]Alright, go ahead.
[322:50.80]Go on.
[322:54.50]Um, yeah, so I really wanted to build how you have some paintings.
[322:59.65]It turns out that paintings don't want to go on the brain.
[323:02.93]So it was an actual thing.
[323:04.97]But I think that also encapsulates what you're doing.
[323:11.53]Yeah, no, I agree with that with that.
[323:13.23]No, loud and clear.
[323:14.18]Thank you, Connor.
[323:14.90]Thank you.
[323:20.60]No, you're doing great.
[323:21.90]We appreciate him.
[323:22.78]That was great.
[323:23.26]So yeah, you can keep walking through hell there.
[323:24.84]Go to the end of hell.
[323:28.42]Go to the end of hell.
[323:29.84]I got bad news about the end of hell, Connor.
[323:32.14]This one's fucking amazing.
[323:33.40]It's just the whole everything going on right now is unbelievable.
[323:35.74]Alright.
[323:36.66]Thank you.
[323:37.16]Keep walking.
[323:38.58]Yeah, so you can keep, so there was supposed to be a punchline.
[323:40.80]I'm just going to be transparent.
[323:41.70]There's supposed to be a punchline at the end of hell here.
[323:43.28]It used to just be a photo of Ludwig, but I was like, well, it's not really that funny to just put Ludwig at the end of hell.
[323:47.83]Like, I don't think Ludwig's that bad.
[323:50.39]And so I deleted it.
[323:52.55]And then that is when I posted in Discord and was like, hey, I can't add any more photos.
[323:56.59]So if you look up there, just imagine like a PNG, well, JPEG actually, I guess, of Ludwig.
[324:01.50]Oh, okay, okay.
[324:02.86]Because that was our original punchline.
[324:04.30]I wanted to replace it with something, like, I was thinking, like, for the Jerma chat, like, maybe, like, a little peep the horror because it's hell or something.
[324:09.94]Oh, okay.
[324:11.16]A little play to the crowd, perhaps.
[324:14.50]You know, just imagine that there, maybe, and, you know.
[324:19.08]One of my favorite things about this is the fact that this is hell, but my goodness, is it green and lush.
[324:25.95]They really touched up the place.
[324:27.69]It's beautiful down here.
[324:30.82]Alright.
[324:31.10]Is there anything else to see?
[324:32.04]Because that was amazing.
[324:34.06]Well, I was going to ask if you wanted to deliver a eulogy for us, actually, at the front of the pew.
[324:39.07]Absolutely.
[324:39.55]Yeah, go ahead.
[324:40.83]Fucking bathtub.
[324:50.10]Uh, friends, uh, family, thanks for joining us in this, uh, this day to, uh, commemorate the lives of both C-Dawg and Conrad's Pants.
[325:03.17]Uh, oops, I meant to say, ooh, sorry, uh, C-Dawg over here, Conrad's Pants is over there.
[325:09.13]Uh, I just want to say that they're dead.
[325:15.21]Let's go!
[325:24.33]That was awesome.
[325:25.93]Our families really appreciate that, Jeremy.
[325:27.61]Thank you so much.
[325:32.70]I'm losing my mind.
[325:33.94]It's so funny.
[325:38.08]You're just on the train, giving a presentation about being burned in hell.
[325:42.63]What is this guy talking about on the train?
[325:46.41]That's so fucking funny.
[325:47.41]He turned on his video.
[326:02.81]Alright, alright, I need to give you guys grades.
[326:06.42]Okay, so, okay, I'm gonna give you a philosophy- let's start with philosophy because it's sky high.
[326:12.66]Thank you.
[326:13.80]I'm gonna give you- it's- oh my god.
[326:16.24]Okay, your philosophy, uh, is- is- is high, I don't- it's very high, everyone's doing such a great job, I'm in a good mood.
[326:26.01]Uh, I'm gonna give you a- I'm gonna give you a 90 for philosophy.
[326:29.33]Oh, that's the highest score I've ever seen in any category.
[326:32.85]Because it's just everything going on right now.
[326:35.73]The call from the train, like you guys are in hell.
[326:38.34]I mean, it's it's that that's a 90 creativity.
[326:43.40]I do really appreciate the fact that this actually is a pain in the ass.
[326:47.22]The putting all this down here.
[326:49.94]Watching him do it was a pain in the ass, too.
[326:52.18]Yeah.
[326:52.96]Watching him dig a hole into the Earth, telling me, no, this is going to work.
[326:56.52]Yeah.
[326:56.86]Alright.
[326:58.36]And then above like all the fire.
[327:00.54]Yeah, this is great.
[327:02.80]I am going to have to give this in creativity.
[327:06.43]The one thing I the river of I forgot it was a river of blood.
[327:12.41]Yeah, this is that was hard to work around.
[327:15.97]This is going to be I'm giving out high grades.
[327:20.23]I don't care.
[327:21.37]This is also a 90 for creativity.
[327:25.04]Wow.
[327:26.71]Structural integrity is actually pretty good, too.
[327:29.41]I mean, everything seems to be in a good spot.
[327:33.52]You've got, I mean, the one thing I'd say is it's a little roomy in here.
[327:37.68]It's a little big.
[327:39.28]Yeah.
[327:39.96]So maybe you'd lose a little bit on that.
[327:42.15]Actually, this is a good ceiling, but I'm kind of confused what's going on here.
[327:48.51]That would be the tree going into the building, actually.
[327:52.39]Yeah, because structurally, that's kind of bleeding in a little.
[327:55.07]But I think you still did a pretty good job with it.
[327:56.93]I'm going to give you an 82 for structure.
[327:58.91]Thank you.
[328:00.59]And then chat.
[328:02.33]What do we have for chat screen?
[328:09.67]This chat?
[328:10.45]What did they give?
[328:11.15]Let's see.
[328:17.50]The reveal.
[328:21.25]Where is the... Okay, so... Oh, they gave you a 95.
[328:24.01]They gave you an A. Wow.
[328:26.93]Oh, my God.
[328:27.51]Thank you.
[328:27.89]I can't believe that scored higher than my 100 Thieves Orphanage.
[328:30.77]So, you guys ended up at an 88.7 for that.
[328:34.82]And overall... Ooh.
[328:38.16]You guys are at an 84.9 overall.
[328:40.76]That's a B. You guys are at a B. That's awesome.
[328:43.92]Wow.
[328:44.46]Nice.
[328:45.08]I'm so proud of that.
[328:46.24]I can end happy today.
[328:47.41]Thank you so much.
[328:50.13]Honestly, Connor, you being on the train and us hearing train noises gave you guys both, I think, at least five extra points.
[328:58.48]Yep.
[328:59.08]That was a good call.
[328:59.84]That was a great call.
[329:02.92]I did shut off my noise.
[329:04.00]I thought you'd enjoy it.
[329:06.40]That was awesome.
[329:06.96]Thank you, guys.
[329:08.12]C-Dawg, Connor, I know everyone's got, you know, you got people have shit to do, but I appreciate you hanging out for as long as you have.

[329:44.41]I mean, I don't want to say there's a lot of pressure on this team, but you had two very high scores in the beginning.
[329:54.58]Yeah, and just as a reminder, don't judge us too hard, because this is my first time ever playing House Flipper, and it's a really hard game to learn and just be thrown into and not really know what you're doing.
[330:03.06]I know.
[330:04.18]Trust me, I know.
[330:07.18]They sound tired.
[330:08.00]I mean, it's been like five hours.
[330:11.87]It's been like four.
[330:12.79]You're building a house all day.
[330:13.99]You're building a house for five hours.
[330:15.41]Okay.
[330:18.07]It should be called like the Delve.
[330:20.77]You just cut out.
[330:21.44]Sorry, say it again.
[330:22.76]It should be called the Delve or something like that.
[330:25.08]Yeah, I think I saved it as.
[330:27.82]Also, we have a request that you do not click the edit and you just click play.
[330:31.58]So just click play.
[330:32.36]Yes.
[330:33.19]Okay.
[330:33.97]Okay.
[330:37.45]Thank you.
[330:39.63]That's interesting.
[330:45.24]Okay, you said it's called... The Delve 2.
[330:51.04]The Delve 2.
[330:53.65]So, play.
[330:54.81]Play.
[330:56.61]I am going to make sure that people can see.
[331:00.37]Which they can.
[331:00.89]Am I in the right spot?
[331:02.27]Yep.
[331:02.41]Let me just deactivate my cam.
[331:05.08]Hold on.
[331:07.64]And reactivate.
[331:10.02]Oh, he's reacting.
[331:11.94]So, I am ready.
[331:14.19]Here we go.
[331:15.35]Today, we would like to take you on an ancient quest, an adventure through a tomb of trials, tribulations, quests, earning treasure, a full The Delve experience.
[331:28.99]It is up to you, young adventurer.
[331:31.34]What do you do?
[331:33.04]Hmm.
[331:41.48]What is going on over here?
[331:43.72]Ah, you inspect the ancient hill.
[331:45.75]You heard tales that the tribals once called this the hill of foreboding, and one should travel no further, but one day you shall understand its true meaning.
[331:56.52]Alright, okay.
[331:57.06]What lies behind?
[331:58.04]What lies behind the... What lies under you will see.
[332:03.14]What lies under... Don't, don't!
[332:04.76]Dude, restart.
[332:05.82]You have to restart.
[332:07.34]You're dead.
[332:08.28]You lost.
[332:08.74]You lost at the intro.
[332:10.42]We're at the tutorial.
[332:15.41]You have two people telling you to stop.
[332:17.09]Oh, shit!
[332:17.75]Alright, hold on.
[332:18.57]Let me go back.
[332:25.11]I lost?
[332:26.11]Oh, shit.
[332:27.13]I'm sorry.
[332:29.59]Well, we designed it as hardcore, so I think maybe we just go to the next group.
[332:34.79]Oh, no.
[332:35.18]Alright, there it is.
[332:39.88]Okay, play.
[332:41.76]Reset progress.
[332:43.14]Yeah, we're going to need a reset from level one again.
[332:45.88]Alright, so don't go that way.
[332:49.45]Here we go.
[332:49.77]Alright, I'm going to go this way.
[332:55.44]This is intimidating.
[333:03.46]You'll notice on your left, a switch.
[333:08.44]Oh, that was the fire alarm.
[333:10.10]Hey, whoa, what the fuck?
[333:14.16]How do I turn it off?
[333:18.26]Some say it could never be turned off.
[333:20.62]What is this for?
[333:22.17]That's a mirror, but you can't see yourself in it because you're a vampire.
[333:25.21]What's wrong with my guy?
[333:27.23]Mike, it's me!
[333:29.03]It's you?
[333:29.37]Okay, hold on.
[333:30.83]Oh god, shit's going wrong.
[333:32.23]Alright.
[333:35.54]You chose vampire.
[333:36.76]Oh, what's that?
[333:42.58]On your left!
[333:46.48]I will advise that this is a dangerous side quest and only the most trained veterans can handle it.
[333:52.88]It is optional, so if you fail and perish, it is only you to blame.
[333:56.82]Uh, I'm gonna- What the fuck is that sound?
[334:02.10]I'm going- I'm doing a side quest.
[334:04.26]Ah, another light to your right.
[334:07.72]The small circle on the wall, your perception detects it.
[334:19.36]Ah, fond memories of the day's events.
[334:24.84]Visions from earlier?
[334:26.62]Has someone been tracking you?
[334:28.04]My fucking stomach hurts.
[334:31.89]Okay.
[334:36.07]Whose hand is that?
[334:37.07]I don't know.
[334:41.63]Okay, so here's... What's the quest?
[334:45.33]There it is.
[334:48.22]Oh, do I pick it up?
[334:50.76]Remember to water the plants?
[334:56.22]Is that the quest?
[334:58.14]Can I go in here?
[335:00.34]The sewer is in beta.
[335:02.20]Oh, okay.
[335:02.52]Okay.

[336:31.80]Damn.
[336:32.50]You gotta get to the top.
[336:33.90]You gotta get to the top.
[336:35.35]You're so close.
[336:36.21]That's like the lock.
[336:37.01]That's the final jump.
[336:38.31]Ugh, alright.
[336:40.17]You got it if you can get the cue ball.
[336:42.15]Oh my god.
[336:49.26]How did you get that up there?
[336:52.28]How did you get that up there?
[336:53.58]How big is that?
[336:55.40]That's bigger than like the sun.
[336:58.28]Okay, I'm going for it.
[337:05.46]God damn it.
[337:10.30]Oh, come on.
[337:10.98]I can do this.

[337:26.03]Wait.
[337:31.31]Oh, I got it!
[337:31.91]Oh my gosh.
[337:36.28]Fuck.
[337:37.40]Okay, wait, hold on.
[337:42.42]You said he was not going to do it at all.
[337:44.98]I believed.
[337:46.56]It's Grotto Beasts, you filthy ancient treasure!
[337:49.47]Look up!
[337:50.17]Look up!
[337:50.71]Long hidden away in the temple.
[338:02.68]I don't know what to score this, but it's like a 100.
[338:05.56]You know what I mean?
[338:07.20]This is a 100, but can I do that?
[338:11.11]Okay.
[338:12.43]Philosophy.
[338:14.03]It's just, I mean, you took all the... How did we even get the fucking pictures?
[338:18.19]Did you just go screen cap everything?
[338:20.21]Did you go to the VOD?
[338:21.07]I don't know how you even did this.
[338:23.45]We've been watching closely.
[338:25.73]Okay.
[338:26.71]And another thing.
[338:27.31]I... We...
[338:32.94]Are you doing those sounds manually?
[338:34.58]It just needs batteries.
[338:36.88]They need batteries.
[338:37.80]I don't hear anything.
[338:38.64]You get used to it.
[338:42.38]Okay.
[338:43.38]It's, this is, it was very, very, very funny.
[338:46.40]Very good.
[338:46.92]Try to fall and see the picture.
[338:48.34]Do you see the picture?
[338:50.12]What picture?
[338:50.62]Fall in?
[338:53.51]Oh, what is, what is that?
[338:55.75]What was that?
[338:58.29]What is that?
[339:00.80]It's the, it's the, it's the hill of foreboding.
[339:03.64]Oh my god.
[339:04.36]Okay.
[339:06.16]Uh, so just to move this along a little, this was very, very, very fun, very funny.
[339:10.58]Uh... I can't, I don't even know how that face was even made.
[339:17.74]I don't know.
[339:19.64]Alright, you, okay, let's start with creativity.
[339:22.04]Creativity is, you had, you had a story, you had like a quest that's really fun.
[339:25.92]Uh, I had to, you know, go through, you know, the...
[339:32.61]Okay.
[339:33.23]Creativity, you're... I think you just... I think you guys just have to get, like... My stomach hurts.
[339:45.30]I laughed way too hard.
[339:48.60]90... It's over 97 for creativity.
[339:54.32]Because this is just like... This is just insane.
[340:00.18]You got the only up in there, and it works too.
[340:02.82]And about, hold on, like Ludwig's and Doug Doug's was very well made.
[340:07.26]It was long.
[340:07.82]It was like a full game.
[340:09.72]You got like a little snippet here and it works.
[340:11.78]It's very good.
[340:12.50]You got these funny pictures.
[340:14.76]I had the poetry.
[340:17.00]Did it come through?
[340:19.01]Oh, no.
[340:19.39]Yeah, I heard everything.
[340:20.43]Okay, good.
[340:21.13]Good.
[340:21.43]That's important to me.
[340:22.37]Yeah.
[340:22.63]Getting to this point and having like the only up narration is I think you get a 99.
[340:28.66]The most important part.
[340:29.78]Thank you.
[340:30.72]Is that it's shorter.
[340:32.23]I think you get 99 I actually like I actually like the the ending because I mean you know Grotto Beasts by the way early on sale and oh there you go I saw it alright you get a 99 for creativity your philosophy is going to be it's going to be high but it's 90 like
[340:56.80]None of these grades really matter.
[340:58.38]And, like, everybody's did such a great job.
[340:59.92]And this is, like, literally just... When you get to, like, the 95+, y'all essentially did the same good.
[341:07.28]But I'm gonna have to give you a 97 on your philosophy.
[341:11.78]Your structural integrity, this works.
[341:13.56]It's very well.
[341:14.26]I don't know if I can give you as high of a structural integrity as I gave to Ludwig and DougDoug, because they did a lot of that.
[341:21.87]And there was a lot of fishing rods and a lot of bullshit they had to do and test it.
[341:26.47]But I think you, I mean, it looks great.
[341:29.27]I didn't, I did notice a little bit over here, a little bit of an issue.
[341:36.76]I don't know what happened here.
[341:37.99]This is a little, uh,
[341:41.21]the the ancients you're not supposed to go back here really like dungeons and dragon is very much like what you see and like I directed you in the right way and you never went back there so I did my job oh that's true well so chat gave you 95 you got an a that's the highest grade you can get from chat anyways so I'm gonna give you for structural integrity I'm gonna give you a 90 I think is fair and you guys currently
[342:08.77]You guys are currently in first place with 96.
[342:12.73]Followed by Ludwig and DougDoug at 95.
[342:14.52]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[342:17.96]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[342:19.12]You have a 96.0.
[342:22.21]You guys did a phenomenal job.
[342:24.44]Thank you so much.
[342:25.80]You guys rock.
[342:26.36]If you got to leave, I get it.
[342:27.52]We got like four more of these to do.
[342:29.96]But thank you.
[342:30.90]Poke, Ster.
[342:31.48]It was fucking hilarious.
[342:33.10]You guys rock.
[342:33.74]My stomach hurts bad.
[342:34.78]I'm going to have to take a bath later.
[342:38.36]You got me.
[342:39.33]You got me.
[342:40.69]Alright.
[342:43.03]Who is up next?
[342:44.01]Because we I don't want to make sure we go to the other channel because we jumbled around a little.
[342:47.87]So who is up next now?
[342:51.43]Was it potentially myself and Kiwo?
[342:55.05]Yes.
[342:56.13]It's very late for us.
[342:57.99]So it's like 3am for us.
[342:59.49]Let's get you guys out of here.
[343:02.47]Please, please let us leave.
[343:04.31]Let us out, please.
[343:06.73]Okay, so do I have yours here?
[343:12.19]I should have it posted there.
[343:13.70]And for mine as well, I'm going to request that you click play and not edit.
[343:19.24]You got it.
[343:19.50]Thank you.
[343:26.64]Yeah, those of you, thanks for staying up.
[343:28.52]I really wanted this to be under, like, five to five and a half hours, but... And I know people gotta go.
[343:35.39]I really do appreciate people sticking around, though.
[343:36.85]Hope you're having fun.
[343:38.59]I hope it's been a good time.
[343:40.29]Oh, this has been great.
[343:40.97]Like, honestly, it's like a House Flipper 2 marathon.
[343:43.27]Like, I've actually really enjoyed this.
[343:48.23]It's been so much fun.
[343:49.28]Yeah, I'm just glad people had a good time.
[343:51.50]It's been a blast on my end, so I hope it's been good for everybody else.
[343:54.60]I hope it's been a fun experience.
[343:55.60]It's been great.
[343:56.32]There's a lot of hearts in the chat on my end at the moment.
[343:58.40]Everyone's been having a lovely time.
[344:00.30]Europeans are struggling, but you know.
[344:02.10]I know.
[344:02.52]I'm so sorry.
[344:03.68]What else is new?
[344:06.03]Alright, I'm gonna hit play, and then I'm gonna make sure this all works.
[344:08.55]Yeah, so play.
[344:09.01]It should load up in the correct spot, and I'll try and direct you here.
[344:13.45]Yeah, I'm not gonna look, and you tell me when you think I should.
[344:16.01]Okay, no, you're good to open your eyes.
[344:19.99]Good to open my eyes?
[344:21.61]So, we really, like, we're actually just really excited for the launch of House Flipper 2, and we really just want to try and showcase...
[344:30.08]the game.
[344:30.44]This is a House Flipper 2 show home.
[344:35.42]The idea was to give you a preview of features that are in House Flipper 2 because we're just genuinely excited for it.
[344:42.36]I would like to give special thanks to Kiwo for actually making that sign in our 90 minutes of time, basically.
[344:48.56]Any of the signs you see, Kiwo actually made them while we were prepping our house.
[344:55.12]Oh, so you guys did double time.
[344:59.18]Basically, while I was on the show floor, Kiwa was making her art assets and we were a bit smart about that and tried to strategize that as we were going through.
[345:07.88]Wow.
[345:09.26]Alright.
[345:09.72]That's smart.
[345:10.54]We have a show home to showcase the game.
[345:12.88]But first and foremost, as you step on in, we'd like you to step on inside.
[345:16.98]I'm hoping this has worked.
[345:18.92]Okay.
[345:19.28]If you take out the sell tool.
[345:24.15]We actually made a quest in the game using House Flipper 2's tools that is basically bananas that you'll find as you go through the house.
[345:34.17]It's using the new quest system.
[345:35.48]It should hopefully work.
[345:37.72]If you want to just try sell that.
[345:40.66]I sold it.
[345:42.40]It might be having a bit of issue.
[345:44.00]Okay.
[345:44.42]We really tried to showcase that.
[345:46.50]There's a quest tool in game where you can actually assign objectives.
[345:49.99]So what we actually did is we actually put a quest
[345:53.03]into the house.
[345:54.05]A real quest.
[345:55.71]It's a real quest.
[345:56.57]This is actually in the game.
[345:58.15]That's the thing.
[345:59.01]There is a feature.
[346:00.61]I don't know if it's tracking somewhere at the moment.
[346:03.12]Maybe it's working.
[346:05.26]Is there like an objective somewhere?
[346:07.46]We did actually set it up.
[346:11.11]What would I be looking for?
[346:13.53]What's the... There should be a little pop-up in the UI that's showcasing that it's working.
[346:19.86]Maybe something might come up if you catch all the bananas, basically, as you go through the house.
[346:23.34]But the idea was to show different... Yeah, it's just the bananas, basically.
[346:27.82]Just pick them up.
[346:28.34]It's just a little quest to try and get you through the home as you go.
[346:31.33]Cool, cool.
[346:31.89]We try to showcase as many features as we can.
[346:33.87]So, welcome.
[346:35.01]Here is your doors.
[346:37.01]We know you like your doors.
[346:38.17]I love doors.
[346:38.97]Behind the door for you.
[346:41.79]Um, we have like a few, like a fireplace and some like kind of furniture fittings for things that you can kind of wire up on the other side of the wall.
[346:48.57]Don't need to sell those.
[346:49.55]Don't worry.
[346:50.21]I can see you hovering.
[346:55.35]No, it's all good.
[346:56.55]If you want to just like kind of take your time in the doors, you know, take your time.
[346:59.77]There's a lot of doors to kind of open and walk through.
[347:01.67]Let me tell you, this is, this is a beautiful house.
[347:03.73]This is like a beautiful spot.
[347:05.59]Apologies.
[347:07.05]Are you in edit mode?
[347:08.35]Did you click play?
[347:09.47]Yeah, I should be.
[347:12.11]My chat is freaking out at the moment.
[347:13.69]Having these tools means I should be in play mode.
[347:17.15]I'm not entirely sure.
[347:18.36]That's alright.
[347:18.94]There is a quest there.
[347:20.32]There is a quest there.
[347:22.42]Work your way through the house if you want.
[347:24.82]Once you're wrapped up with those doors.
[347:26.22]We have showrooms.
[347:28.92]Sell that banana.
[347:30.41]Housepliffer roofing.
[347:32.37]Yep, so thank you again to Kiwo for making all of these signs.
[347:35.62]These are the new roofing options that are available in House Flipper 2, because this is just something you didn't really have to play with in House Flipper 1, and it's kind of cool that you can come up with new creations.
[347:44.86]Yeah, so we made a little showcase of bits of roofing, just for stuff you can make and kind of combine, because you actually have...
[347:52.91]more options now to customize your houses, which is just genuinely really cool.
[347:58.83]I'm glad they actually have that in the game now.
[348:01.39]We made some like little floor samples for how you can do like effectively different rugs on your floor.
[348:06.50]Just some like kind of sample ones there.
[348:08.12]And we also want the highlight that you can actually cut out those spaces too.
[348:11.72]You may notice there's a hole in that particular sample there.
[348:15.08]okay can I just stop you for a second and just tell you that you knowing all this you've you've only had the game for like what two days I yeah no I I've I've got started today I think like one day and you you're like you're like in from this is a ton of great information
[348:36.16]I mean, we're just excited, you know?
[348:38.52]Holy shit, look at this!
[348:39.96]House number two is, like, it's one of the anticipated games of the year.
[348:43.39]Like, seriously, I love the first game.
[348:45.07]I'm excited to see them doing stuff with two.
[348:46.63]I love the new engine and shit that they've done here.
[348:48.93]Yeah, so this is, like, just a furniture showcase room, just to kind of list some of, like, the options that, like, you have again.
[348:54.43]Because there's so many new assets, more than anything else, that you can actually customize your home with.
[349:00.30]That's just really cool to see.
[349:01.84]Like, they've made so much cool, just new shit appliances everywhere.
[349:06.32]uh we have like a lot of like on the default paintings and that if you look at that window actually too you see how that's the void yeah so we we just put that there just to show hey this is a new thing you can do in this game that wasn't in House Flipper one you can go you can go underground now that's the thing that was the idea if you look at the other window on your left
[349:26.20]You can now customize the terrain and raise hills and make these kind of funky sculptures.
[349:30.58]As if you're doing a fancy kind of garden or something.
[349:33.91]Again, just really cool possibilities that are now possible in the game.
[349:38.35]If you want to head down that hall there on your left.
[349:40.27]This one here?
[349:41.51]Yeah, this one here.
[349:42.97]Okay, structural integrity, you guys are pretty much at 100.
[349:46.29]Because this is like beautiful.
[349:48.23]Look at this work.
[349:49.27]Look at this.
[349:52.08]Look at that.
[349:52.40]This is unbelievable architecture, by the way.
[349:55.97]I mean, thanks.
[349:56.63]No, honestly, we spent a lot of time just bloody painting the walls and the roof and just getting the floor right.
[350:05.89]Yeah, so just to show different features, you can now place stairs.
[350:08.92]So you may notice that grand staircase just on your right.
[350:11.86]I know you're eagle-eyed for those bananas right now.
[350:15.96]You tell me to click bananas, I'll start clicking.
[350:19.68]I mean, I think we were right on the money with picking the banana.
[350:22.84]It's a great philosophy.
[350:26.07]But, like, in that room back there, like, we just showcased some of, like, the tools that you have on the workbench, different types of paint.
[350:31.43]We actually want to showcase, like, just the splatter features, how you can actually specifically place dirt in your home if you want to do that and actually set up a level specifically for, like, your friends to play and shit like that.
[350:41.24]I didn't know you could do that.
[350:42.74]I knew you could do trash, but you could do, like, paint splatter.
[350:45.01]That's kind of crazy.
[350:45.63]But, like, that's the idea.
[350:46.69]You can actually assign that.
[350:47.85]So the idea with the quest was you can actually clean that up, too.
[350:51.57]So you can literally just make custom levels for your friends.
[350:55.14]is the idea you you and just scrub it and like that's the idea so if you want to make like a dirty house for your friends to clean and play House Flipper 2-in you can just do that now which is actually really cool because it's not really been as accessible as it is now um in that regard
[351:11.64]um if you want to have a look just about the showroom we've just got some like the toilets we got a House Flipper assigned there um we have like some of the new electronic equipment the fact that you can specifically get more pc options and stuff like that it's actually wiring there's a wire there's wiring yes I don't know how it works so there's a light switch behind the keyboard lights um behind the lights
[351:34.87]There's a light switch on the wall just behind them.
[351:37.65]And if you just want to flick that.
[351:39.55]Because you can actually assign multiple lights to a wire in now.
[351:42.35]Which I don't think you can do like that in House Flipper 1.
[351:45.65]I'm not entirely sure.
[351:47.07]But you can just assign as many as you want.
[351:48.56]And they've made it significantly easier to use.
[351:50.94]Like, it's really cool that they've done that for this game.
[351:54.40]Somebody put the lids down?
[351:56.30]Oh, come on.
[351:57.04]I'm good.
[351:58.90]Did I put them all up?
[352:00.84]Thank you.
[352:01.36]Thank you.
[352:01.66]It's just polite.
[352:02.46]It's just polite.
[352:04.26]Trampoline.
[352:04.96]Also, yeah, so the trampoline is here, but you may notice that there is a banana there on the paint next to the wall.
[352:11.27]Do you see that painting there?
[352:12.67]I do.
[352:12.91]Kiwo actually made that herself.
[352:15.69]You just did like right now, like in the last hour.
[352:18.07]Well, yes.
[352:20.27]Because, you know, we wanted to get a tasteful Miku and a tasteful Marijin because, you know, you've been kind of ranting and raving about them all night.
[352:28.05]So we thought, OK, let's not just like JPEG the fucking walls.
[352:31.30]Kiwo actually drew that while we were building the house.
[352:34.88]damn um you know like all four lines all four lines yeah like I stayed within the lines when I call it them too I'm very proud of myself banana but that but there you go like that is the show house oh that is the show room house effectively um there's a few more bits like we tried to demonstrate in the room with the wall so you can cut away walls now significantly easier
[352:59.62]the front garden there's like stuff like the terrain tools where you can make little divots I can't believe you did this in 90 minutes like this is ridiculous um just like a little showcase here with like the flowers and stuff like that and just the fact that you can do hills if you walk over that hill as well you can kind of see some of the more uneven terrain that you can actually get so look at those little divots in that like you can really customize it now like significantly more
[353:23.98]Oh, one thing we also had to do, we noticed there was some clipping occasionally.
[353:28.91]You can cut the grass as well, so no more clipping.
[353:32.09]You'll see there's a nice pathway to the door.
[353:34.59]Yeah, we mowed the lawn and we made sure as we built the house, because there was a moment where the grass was coming through the walls and shit.
[353:40.78]Hey, structural integrity.
[353:42.20]Structural integrity.
[353:43.77]But thanks, but because you can mow the grass, we just mowed it all.
[353:47.01]So there shouldn't be any grass actually inside the house now.
[353:49.71]The flower bushes would just more or less add it just for a little bit of decoration as you go through.
[353:54.05]This reminds me of like Ikea, like going through Ikea.
[353:57.11]Yeah.
[353:58.49]Yeah.
[353:59.97]It's a little bit like Ikea.
[354:01.61]Oh, you missed a banana there.
[354:02.67]I did.
[354:03.43]In front of the radiators.
[354:05.09]In front of the radiators.
[354:05.93]There you go.
[354:06.53]You got it.
[354:08.51]Well, this is great.
[354:11.38]This is a philosophy.
[354:12.84]I'm going to give you a 95 for philosophy because I don't know how to play the fucking game either.
[354:17.29]So it's good to see some of these things.
[354:19.13]I have to learn it too.
[354:20.23]So I love the philosophy of learning and education.
[354:22.71]It's great.
[354:24.51]Like, I mean, that was just the idea.
[354:26.41]Because we're just excited for the game.
[354:28.15]We just want to showcase some of the new shit, you know?
[354:32.27]This is just really cool.
[354:33.59]Your build is great.
[354:35.35]I mean, this is like a beautiful... You made a show... This is not a home.
[354:42.04]You made literally Ikea.
[354:43.00]You literally made Ikea, which you could not do in the last game.
[354:45.56]That's fucking cool.
[354:47.34]For creativity, I am going to give you...
[354:52.24]A B?
[354:52.80]A B?
[354:52.88]I'm gonna say probably B, like, 87?
[354:55.46]88?
[354:55.58]I'll give you 88.
[354:57.43]And the only reason why it's not a 90 is... Mmm...
[355:05.13]Maybe it should be a 90.
[355:05.91]Maybe it should be a 90-something.
[355:09.19]I mean, it's very respectable, you know?
[355:12.56]Like, whatever you decide, you know?
[355:14.36]Like, we had a lot of fun just making this more than anything.
[355:18.16]We've demonstrated quite a lot of different things in our builds throughout the evening.
[355:22.90]But you got this.
[355:24.66]You made all these custom posters.
[355:27.97]Honestly, like, Kiwo was fucking amazing.
[355:32.05]Yeah, this is like, you did, like, a custom drawing.

[358:07.97]Where's your guys' build?
[358:09.39]Did you send it in, Joel?
[358:11.21]Yeah.
[358:13.24]It says Vinny, Joel and Vinny's house in the basement uploads.

[358:20.08]There we go.
[358:20.32]Sorry.
[358:21.40]That's my bad.
[358:22.09]Alright.
[358:24.17]I am going to open it over here.
[358:25.89]Let's get out of here.
[358:26.69]That was, that was awesome.
[358:28.11]It's just like a Ikea and it was like perfectly made.
[358:35.92]Alright, it's loading.
[358:37.46]I'm going to take the teams away.
[358:39.64]Only a few more left.
[358:40.80]I know Snuffy and Will Neff are hanging out, I think.
[358:44.30]They're chilling, so they'll probably go next.
[358:48.36]Unless somebody else has to go.
[358:49.34]Or maybe Squeaks.
[358:50.20]We'll see.
[358:50.88]Out of those people, we'll get them in the call and see who's like, hey, man, I've got to get the fuck out of here.
[358:55.36]So let me open it up.
[359:00.82]How come you look all fucked up?
[359:04.82]Jesus.
[359:06.65]You guys don't get messages like that?
[359:09.61]Yeah, sometimes.
[359:10.95]Why do you look so fucked up?
[359:12.85]Yeah.
[359:14.60]I think Twitch chat has a lot of respect for the streamer.
[359:17.44]In general.
[359:17.96]Well, I'm sweating, so that's why.
[359:21.22]Okay.
[359:22.46]Did I get it in?
[359:23.13]I did.
[359:23.75]Let's go.
[359:34.05]Turn off PC capture.
[359:35.74]Turn off the grades.
[359:37.04]I just thought of my... Ow.
[359:41.76]Okay.
[359:46.75]It is... There you are.
[359:54.53]And should I edit or play?
[359:58.37]Edit should be fine, right, Joel?
[360:00.73]I'm going to say this.
[360:02.45]Now, I've been teasing and talking about this throughout the night that I have high confidence that these brain puzzles is going to lead us to victory.
[360:11.66]It's not a guarantee, though, but whatever.
[360:13.94]So I'm going to say this.
[360:15.40]Whatever you do, do not noclip from the start, okay?
[360:19.27]Don't noclip, okay.
[360:21.15]And I'm going to say this.
[360:21.93]I'm looking at the ground.
[360:23.21]Yeah, I'm looking at the ground.
[360:27.51]Turn around.
[360:27.99]Go out that front door.
[360:30.07]Keep going.
[360:30.53]Keep straight, straight, straight.
[360:32.21]And go out that door.
[360:34.75]right and then you can close the door and then you can turn around and look at the house and that's where we'll start and I'll start the okay and don't look in the garage that's all I'm gonna say because I had to make a skybox for this that video did it because before I say anything um I didn't even tell Vinny what I was doing because I don't want anybody squealing about this so I wasn't streaming this Vinny doesn't know I haven't even told him that's all really yeah no I didn't tell him
[361:00.48]cohesion alright so I'll I'll start the first part of the tour um and I wanted to let you know Jerma that the first part the house is something that I built based on a family home of mine okay and I want you to just um enjoy like so there's some history here whoa whoa you've made you in you enclosed
[361:24.32]the whole thing into a fake world.
[361:27.68]Okay, this is very cool.
[361:29.24]Alright.
[361:29.97]I had to.
[361:30.49]I have to say that I had to.
[361:32.43]Okay, so I'll just go in the front door.
[361:38.39]So this is, yeah, I mean, you can see here, like, this is based on, you know, just a real family home of mine.
[361:44.65]I've got the TV, the couch, and some photos of, like, my family on the walls.
[361:56.51]and uh yeah spent a lot of time really trying to get those details right very real family boy and mom samson okay so this is I I I understand where I okay I oh okay okay yeah kitchen door should be close by the way Jeremy close it immediately and do not wait what's behind wait wait what the kitchen door yeah just close that kitchen oh okay okay
[362:25.81]So, yeah, I mean, this is just some more family members.
[362:28.28]Also, I just want to say a little Coca-Cola in your nose.
[362:36.28]It's good for you.
[362:37.80]That's that's an old saying.
[362:40.11]My grandmammy used to say this is fucking crazy.
[362:46.97]yeah yeah it was a crazy family I mean you know when I got bumped on the head a couple years back I was thinking like man did any of that really happen I'm still not sure but that's as I remember it something like that okay grandma is super tall and strives +2 points okay Mr. dink
[363:09.46]Mr. Dink is included in all of my builds.
[363:11.52]I just want to let you know.
[363:12.76]Yo, I'm such a dope.
[363:14.80]I hit the wall like an idiot.
[363:19.83]I mean, yeah.
[363:20.81]Again, that's funny that you knew what my father used to say back in the day like that.
[363:25.69]That's crazy.
[363:26.25]But yeah, so that's my portion of that.
[363:31.31]And I just wanted you to get a little glimpse into my world.
[363:36.64]Listen, we all know it's fucking Family Guy already.
[363:39.50]quit the shit alright we're gonna crank this up well hang on ladies and gentlemen can you look at the beams in the living room oh yeah that's right not that okay look at right look at that I mean that's some pretty pretty good structural integrity thank you Joel you may continue uh and it's not Family Guy but you know it's the samsons come on the samson that's what the thing said over there this was a gamble because Jeremiah hates cartoons
[364:09.83]Um, it depends.
[364:12.99]Anyway.
[364:14.01]Should I open?
[364:16.11]Vinny specifically wanted me to interject and be like, shut up.
[364:20.85]I told him, no, I'm not going to do that joke.
[364:23.23]I got to get this.
[364:24.01]I got to get this off.
[364:24.89]You did it.
[364:30.22]Anyway, Vinny did a wonderful house.
[364:33.32]The problem is,
[364:34.44]I didn't make a house.
[364:35.30]Okay, you didn't make a house, but this is a good Samson house.
[364:39.51]I think it's very, very strong.
[364:42.57]Well, I'm about to open this door.
[364:45.03]Okay.
[364:45.93]So, ladies and gentlemen, we've had many entries in tonight's stream.
[364:51.93]We've had many adventures across planes.
[364:55.54]We have had, you know, a little bit of funeral business.
[365:00.10]But what none of these people have done is broken the game.
[365:04.38]Jerma, you may open the door.
[365:12.43]Now, go into hell.
[365:15.25]Go in here?
[365:16.85]Yes, and look up.
[365:29.16]What is this?
[365:29.88]Oh, my God.
[365:32.12]What is this?
[365:33.76]Jerma?
[365:35.51]You may begin to read the signs.
[365:51.72]Ladies and gentlemen, the quest has begun.
[365:53.99]Okay.
[365:55.49]Now, this is going to be the adventure of a lifetime, Jermo.
[365:58.89]Oh, fuck.
[365:59.31]Hold on.
[365:59.57]There we go.
[366:00.79]You may begin to climb.
[366:05.24]Hold down space.
[366:05.80]You can climb.
[366:07.60]I can?
[366:07.90]You're climbing.
[366:08.48]You just hold down space.
[366:10.20]Whoa!
[366:10.52]It actually works!
[366:11.80]Joel, this works.
[366:13.54]I'm not no-clipping.
[366:14.48]This works.
[366:20.62]Now, again, a lot of people attempting the only up thing, but the thing is... Jeremy, you're glitching out.
[366:27.75]You're glitching out at the start.
[366:29.03]Oh, dear God.
[366:29.75]Okay.
[366:34.90]Okay, just keep going.
[366:35.96]Anyway, as I was saying, a lot of people did the only up thing.
[366:38.63]The thing is, there's a certain amount of stairs in this game, and they break the skybox limit.
[366:45.83]And well, all I'm gonna say is this, this is going to be quite the journey.
[366:49.43]So if you if you want to quit, because there's other people after us that are waiting, you may just use spacebar.
[366:55.17]But anyway, ladies and gentlemen, I am I didn't give the finger.
[367:04.28]Yes, you did.
[367:05.10]No, I didn't.
[367:05.82]That's proof.
[367:07.18]Yes, you're being rude.
[367:08.36]Anyway, go on.
[367:09.72]Keep going up.
[367:10.42]And I'm going to let you know this because we are time limited.
[367:13.55]Just no clip yourself up.
[367:15.83]It's going to take some time.
[367:17.01]It's going to take time.
[367:18.43]How big is this?
[367:20.41]No, I'm telling you, no clip.
[367:21.81]I am giving you mercy, okay?
[367:25.53]Dude, how far?
[367:28.37]This does not go that far, does it?
[367:29.97]Holy shit.
[367:33.43]But anyway, my point is, the thing is, you can put objects up in the sky, right?
[367:39.49]Uh-huh.
[367:39.97]But you got to manually do it on the floor and then take them up.
[367:43.01]But stairs in this game eventually crashed the game.
[367:46.45]And, well, yeah.
[367:54.60]Now, Jeremiah, I don't know how the scale goes in terms of score.
[367:58.08]Uh-huh.
[367:59.00]But you better start writing things down because this journey is going to add up.
[368:05.83]I'm just shocked that the sky box lets you go this high.
[368:09.37]I thought there was a limit.
[368:10.71]I thought there was an actual limit.
[368:13.39]There's no limit.
[368:13.97]Well, I thought so, too, until I realized there's something wrong in the game.
[368:17.47]I don't know what I just did, but I'm good.
[368:21.76]I'm good.
[368:24.34]You know, I got to give it to you.
[368:25.54]You are actually climbing this.
[368:26.90]I thought you would just fly up, but I commend you.
[368:31.06]on your thing it's a tower of bubble I call it who is frozen he must have word number one okay unfortunately you're not frozen right now in your face can which sucks but oh did I eat a booger I may have eaten a booger at some point in the last like six hours I don't know maybe well there's scientific proof on camera
[368:54.30]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[368:57.89]No.
[368:58.09]Okay.
[368:59.09]RT and Kiwo just did one.
[369:00.77]And they were showcasing the game and stuff.
[369:05.91]But this is ridiculous.
[369:11.57]I had no idea this was going to happen.
[369:14.03]No, I didn't tell Vinny or anybody.
[369:15.41]That's why I didn't stream this.
[369:16.57]But halfway there, King.
[369:17.65]Halfway there.
[369:18.25]What do you mean halfway?
[369:19.53]I'm halfway?
[369:21.37]Halfway there, King.
[369:25.49]Now keep going, keep going.
[369:26.59]You're ascending.
[369:27.13]You're doing a great job, buddy.
[369:31.11]Think of that Bon Jovi song right now.
[369:36.01]You know the one.
[369:39.17]Okay, when I first looked at this, I thought it was an antenna.
[369:43.85]This is a full... It's an antenna to heaven.
[369:46.37]I'm going to heaven.
[369:47.01]And it's an antenna to the magical treasure.
[369:51.08]I keep telling you, Jerma, I'm telling you, this is going to be worth it.
[369:54.12]I know a lot of you guys are like, holy shit, this is going to take three goddamn hours to do.
[369:59.26]But that's not the case, because you know what?
[370:02.72]Those who wait for something good never waits too long.
[370:05.61]It's an old Swedish saying, actually.
[370:07.01]Okay.
[370:07.85]But anyway, keep ascending, King.
[370:09.41]Your crown awaits.
[370:15.56]These pictures.
[370:17.20]I swear to God.
[370:18.18]He gave me an extra five minutes to finish up my Simpson home.
[370:22.18]Yeah, give Vinny extra time.
[370:25.69]The philosophy on this one is interesting to me because you both Vinny, you made like a great Simpsons house and then Joel made an antenna into the stratosphere.
[370:40.76]I mean, did you expect anything else?
[370:42.58]I love it.
[370:46.28]Now, um, I will say this.
[370:48.32]I do think it is pretty funny that we've had Doug, Doug Ludwig, and, uh, you know, we have a previous contestants that have thought of the same thing, but you you've achieved the wooden zone.
[370:59.91]That means you're ascending.
[371:01.99]Well, it's, it's elevating you further up in the sky.
[371:05.15]But, you know, great minds think alike here, friends.
[371:07.91]And I got to say, you know, we've had tough competition.
[371:10.98]But this one I have might be put a little bit over the edge.
[371:15.16]It all depends, though.
[371:16.54]But you are ascending quickly towards the sky, my friend.
[371:19.68]I am.
[371:23.24]You're almost there, King.
[371:24.69]My goodness.
[371:25.39]I think this is it.
[371:29.23]Whoa!
[371:29.79]This is it.
[371:32.31]I feel like I'm falling in real life.
[371:34.53]What the hell happened?
[371:36.39]Do not fall off.
[371:37.36]Do not fall off.
[371:38.96]All I'm going to say is this.
[371:40.32]There's a door ahead of you.
[371:42.14]No clip in there.
[371:42.96]Okay.
[371:44.79]You're getting very close now.
[371:47.92]You must have lost your fucking mind making this, by the way.
[371:51.76]Yes, it took a lot of time.
[371:53.52]See that door?
[371:54.30]That's for you, Jeremy.
[371:55.90]Go in and collect your prize.
[371:58.30]There's a prize behind this door.
[371:59.97]There's a prize behind the door, buddy.
[372:05.51]Your crown awaits in the garage, King.
[372:08.91]That's right.
[372:11.69]Okay.
[372:11.97]Now, here's what you do.
[372:13.07]Just drop down.
[372:14.65]Stop no clipping.
[372:15.38]Go pew!
[372:17.05]Down in The Simpsons home.
[372:20.33]Alright.
[372:27.56]You're falling.
[372:28.22]You're falling.
[372:28.78]You're falling.
[372:29.16]But you're going to be okay.
[372:33.28]Okay.
[372:34.26]So you said the prize is in the garage.
[372:37.60]Yeah, yeah, but be careful how you enter.
[372:39.12]Enter it normally.
[372:39.88]Enter it normally.
[372:40.85]Do not, like, no clip into it.
[372:42.31]Just go from the front entrance.
[372:44.05]Just go normally.
[372:44.69]Okay.
[372:45.87]So this is... I mean, what is normally?
[372:47.97]This is your fucking neighbor?
[372:51.73]Like, oh, yeah, how's the neighbor doing?
[372:53.49]Oh, I'm not so sure.
[372:55.05]They literally have white blockades in front of everything.
[372:59.14]Who lives here?
[372:59.54]Well, if you're a high-five god, you know, why not?
[373:05.23]Do you think the HOA has something to say about this?
[373:07.65]Alright, so go to the garage.
[373:11.85]This garage over here.
[373:14.85]Yes.
[373:16.27]Now, Vinny told me to put a little toy car inside.
[373:18.81]Unfortunately, I missed that, so you may deduct points.
[373:21.63]But go in, King.
[373:25.25]You see that door.
[373:26.69]That is for you, Jeremy.
[373:29.62]Now, ascend inside.
[373:32.34]Inside, you will find the answers soon.
[373:50.98]Do you see?
[373:53.25]Now you see.
[373:55.09]Now you see.
[373:55.67]Is it the outfit?
[373:56.29]Is it the outfit?
[373:59.63]If judge makes hand gina?
[374:05.31]What?
[374:06.51]That's vulgar.
[374:07.55]But I did have naughty and I incorporated naughty into my concept because
[374:11.85]It's very torturous to go up here.
[374:13.21]Oh, God.
[374:14.03]And you look like Matthew McConaughey a little bit.
[374:16.68]So that's 20 points extra.

[374:57.55]You guys did a great fucking job.
[374:59.03]I even- I forgot that you made an entire Simpsons house.
[375:02.62]Like, I forgot you did that.
[375:03.98]Like, that's how crazy that just was.
[375:06.70]Alright, creativity, we're gonna start with that.
[375:09.66]I think it's- we're just gonna start throwing out A's, honestly, because people are doing such a great job.
[375:16.36]apparently there's another thing in the winner room that you missed oh was there I I'm so tired I forgot about it in the winner room this one I I don't I don't remember I'm so tired I'm so tired I think my brain turned into mush
[375:34.59]Wonderful job.
[375:35.40]Go get some sleep.
[375:37.04]Creativity.
[375:37.82]I'm going to sleep now.
[375:39.16]Structural integrity.
[375:40.30]Yeah.
[375:40.60]Go get some sleep, Joel.
[375:41.68]Thanks for coming out.
[375:42.25]Thanks for staying up so late.
[375:43.95]I appreciate it.
[375:44.83]You did a great job.
[375:45.51]Let me tell you something.
[375:46.49]Creativity.
[375:48.42]Enclosing the house is unbelievable.
[375:51.58]I'm going to give you a 98 for creativity.
[375:54.80]Because this is awesome.
[375:57.07]That you enclosed the space with the Simpson house.
[376:00.79]That is a brilliant idea.
[376:02.93]Actually, wonderful idea.
[376:05.99]Philosophy...
[376:08.99]It's a little jumbled.
[376:10.41]It's a little jumbled.
[376:12.07]Because we go from The Simpsons to that.
[376:16.71]So I'm going to have to... I'll give you a... I think it's still good.
[376:19.83]I'm going to give you a... I'm going to leave somewhere in the Bs.
[376:21.99]I think it's a low B because the philosophy between the two is not really gelling 100%, but it's still great.
[376:29.16]I'm going to say it's probably... I'm going to give you an 82 for philosophy.
[376:38.70]Jerma sounds like you're like a you're like a fucking food taster on television or like a wine Enthusiast and you're going.
[376:45.26]Oh, yes quite.
[376:46.62]It's quite spectacular, but you're drinking piss No Okay, I I'm gonna
[376:59.98]Okay, so for structural integrity, this is very good structural integrity for half of it.
[377:06.82]The rest of it is a little fucked because it's all this and this.
[377:10.19]I mean, it did work and it was very good.
[377:11.99]I'm going to give you a B. I'm going to give you 84 for structural integrity.
[377:17.03]Don't forget his support beams.
[377:20.51]That's very important.
[377:21.73]Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[377:23.49]And then chat has a grade for you, too.
[377:26.39]What did chat give?
[377:28.68]We'll give you an 85.
[377:30.24]85 for integrity.
[377:35.45]What do we got?
[377:37.03]We got you guys... Ta-da!
[377:39.29]You are at a final grade of... You got 90!
[377:45.98]90 A- for this build.
[377:47.92]And your final grade was 89.6!
[377:48.80]B+, almost an A-.
[377:49.50]Wonderful!
[377:55.11]Yay.
[377:56.79]Oh, yay.
[377:57.47]Vinny, quick.
[377:58.25]Marge.
[377:58.75]Wait, shit, you did one.
[377:59.75]Can I double it down?
[378:00.47]I did it already.
[378:01.37]Can I double it down?
[378:02.75]If you do a marge right now, you're looking for one more point?
[378:04.65]Yeah.
[378:05.31]Yeah.
[378:05.67]Yeah.
[378:07.25]Oh, holy.
[378:08.57]Oh.
[378:11.97]Oh.
[378:12.79]Oh.
[378:13.09]Give him one more point on structural integrity.
[378:14.65]That was pretty good.
[378:16.47]That was actually really good.
[378:17.24]That was really good.
[378:19.16]Alright, fellas.
[378:20.56]Thank you.
[378:20.94]I know it's late.

[378:39.35]Thanks, everybody.
[378:39.93]Peace out.
[378:40.93]I am very blessed to be able to invite so many creative people to do this.
[378:45.26]So this is great for me to watch.
[378:47.72]Alright.
[378:48.58]Let's get people in the call because I want to, because we only have, we have three more.
[378:52.24]So let's get the, let's get Squeaks, Snuffy, and Will Neff, uh, Etalyx, and Criken back up here.
[378:57.12]Because I, I, I want to know who's got to go.
[378:59.50]Like, because I know, this has been six plus hours.
[379:01.43]So I want to make sure people can get out of here.
[379:03.45]I'm good.
[379:04.61]I'll go last.
[379:05.57]Okay.
[379:05.83]I'm in the call.
[379:06.25]Unless Criken needs to go.
[379:07.61]I'm just chilling.
[379:08.75]I'm chilling too.

[379:20.77]Oh, no.
[379:21.29]He's gone.
[379:21.75]Where is he?
[379:22.43]He's in the funeral room.
[379:23.19]Sorry, I'm muted.
[379:24.13]I'm good.
[379:24.99]Okay, cool.
[379:26.09]Yeah, I don't want to spend way too much time doing this because I know it's like you guys, people got stuff to do.
[379:31.00]People are tired.
[379:32.02]I don't want to.
[379:32.50]I want to make sure we can get through these.
[379:34.04]So of the three groups that are remaining, who would like to go?
[379:37.66]Who would like to get out of here?
[379:39.27]I'll go I I do have to pack I'm moving tomorrow oh Jesus okay yeah you should definitely go right now okay I will take your property very in this is an interesting one because you guys did very very good in the first two so yeah and just for context you know I don't be the excuse guy but uh it was just me that made this one so north lion for the last time we just were chit chatting
[380:04.47]Yeah, that's alright, though.
[380:05.93]Maybe he gave you some inspiration.
[380:07.89]He did.
[380:08.35]We talked about, like, the ideas.
[380:10.49]So this one's dedicated to NL.
[380:13.43]And, Jerma, there's a surprise for you.
[380:16.17]More surprises?
[380:16.91]I love surprises.
[380:18.21]There's a massive surprise.
[380:19.89]Alright, let me just get this to load.
[380:23.70]Stop eating cat treats?
[380:30.28]Oh, are you in edit mode, by the way?
[380:32.80]Do you want me to be in play?
[380:34.53]You know, edit's perfect.
[380:36.17]Edit is just perfect.
[380:37.81]Let me just get it up.
[380:39.37]The more houses that I've taken in, the longer it takes to load the imports.
[380:45.23]Well, you know, as it's loading, just as a preface, this is just a regular house.
[380:49.23]You know, I just wanted to go for something classic.
[380:52.09]I was inspired by this game.
[380:53.59]I played it for like two hours.
[380:54.83]So I just built like a regular house, something with, you know, a kitchen, et cetera.
[381:00.95]But I tried to make it look, you know, as good as possible.
[381:04.49]Yeah, you don't have to make, like, a wacky house.
[381:08.43]I mean, structure, integrity, philosophy, you can really just make a house.
[381:15.48]That's fine, too.
[381:17.20]Okay, good.
[381:17.98]But hopefully I didn't forget, like, a sink or something in the bathroom.
[381:21.06]That would be funny.
[381:22.94]Wait, it's still loading?
[381:24.17]Uh-oh.
[381:26.15]I think that's on my end.
[381:28.61]I think it's refreshing.
[381:29.93]Okay, there we go.
[381:31.79]Oh, there we go.
[381:39.29]Now it's loading it.
[381:40.19]You can tell because the loading screen before the loading screen.
[381:44.23]Oh yeah.
[381:44.61]And no, no clipping.
[381:48.33]Just because, you know, I want it to be like a real experience, you know, like you can't fly in real life.
[381:52.37]That's very true.
[381:54.36]I'm just like trying to keep it real.
[381:57.96]Alright.
[381:59.42]It is almost ready.
[382:00.94]I'm going to turn this off so people don't get spoiled and I don't either.
[382:05.24]Let's take the grades off.
[382:09.43]And it is... Hey, there it is.
[382:15.87]There it is, yep.
[382:17.12]And you said edit mode, right?
[382:18.80]Yeah.
[382:19.54]Got it.
[382:21.42]Thank you, all the raiders that have been coming in.
[382:23.12]People have been raiding.
[382:24.82]Thanks.
[382:26.48]Am I looking in there?
[382:27.30]Should I look?
[382:27.72]Is a good spot start?
[382:29.20]Wait, can you, like, turn around?
[382:30.50]Where's the house?
[382:31.84]Uh-oh.
[382:34.13]It's not that avant-garde.
[382:35.07]No, no, no.
[382:36.59]That would have been fucking hilarious, though.
[382:38.43]Where's that?
[382:40.41]You just were like... Okay.
[382:42.85]I can re-export it.
[382:44.77]Oh, it's named Squeaks NL Finale.
[382:46.77]Is that the right game?
[382:48.49]The one uploaded?
[382:49.99]Is this it?
[382:51.90]This is it.
[382:52.32]Yes, go ahead and walk to the front.
[382:56.15]I know you don't want me to noclip, so just... I'm going to look over here so I don't spoil anything.
[383:00.72]Okay, that's fine.
[383:01.34]I can, like, help guide you.
[383:02.48]Yeah, guide me.
[383:04.18]Go to the left.
[383:04.90]Go to the left.
[383:05.82]Hold A. Yep, perfect.
[383:07.67]Keep going.
[383:08.55]Yep.
[383:08.97]Keep going.
[383:09.39]Yeah, now run.
[383:10.23]Okay.
[383:11.09]Now go to the left.
[383:11.75]Okay.
[383:13.03]Okay, go to the... You keep going.
[383:14.63]Okay, perfect.
[383:15.73]Now, remember how I said I had a surprise for you?
[383:17.78]You did, yep.
[383:19.05]Northernlion's here.
[383:20.57]Oh.
[383:21.61]Surprise.
[383:22.13]He's actually waiting for you inside.
[383:23.83]This is a whole plan we've had this entire time.
[383:27.19]Go ahead and open the door and say hello to Northernlion.
[383:33.20]What?
[383:34.42]Wait.
[383:36.76]I'm not even doing a joke right now.
[383:37.90]I'm not kidding around.
[383:39.70]What's going on?
[383:40.70]You killed him.
[383:42.60]Me?
[383:43.66]No, did you?
[383:45.34]No, who did?
[383:47.07]Wait, who killed?
[383:47.94]There's a Peloton over there.
[383:52.14]Wait, what?
[383:53.14]What happened here?
[383:54.42]Jerma, I'm going to need your help for this.
[383:56.38]Because I have no idea.
[383:57.40]I was just building a regular house.
[383:58.89]I'm going to need your help.
[384:00.27]I think we have to find out who killed Northernlion.
[384:04.01]So I want you to take a look around the room.
[384:05.93]Maybe there's a potential clue.
[384:07.90]Okay, so the Peloton, he's a big Peloton user.
[384:11.48]I don't know, there's a candle.
[384:13.48]I'm not sure, that doesn't seem very suspicious, but it's kind of weird.
[384:15.63]Why would a candle be there?
[384:18.41]I mean, it says red rum on the back.
[384:20.57]I think that's a little out of place.
[384:22.03]I think that's a little... Holy smokes, that's murder backwards.
[384:26.83]Is it?
[384:27.05]I just realized.
[384:28.91]Murder, oh, it is, yeah.
[384:32.06]Oh my god, so this was a murder.
[384:34.02]Now really take a look, because there might be a clue somewhere here.
[384:37.64]I'm gonna need your help.
[384:40.05]I see three flowers.
[384:41.91]I see a frog.
[384:43.27]I see a carton of eggs.
[384:46.05]Hmm.
[384:47.05]Very interesting.
[384:48.31]And there's also a knife.
[384:50.60]Oh, that-
[384:51.96]That could be the murder weapon.
[384:53.32]Who knows?
[384:54.52]Um, okay.
[384:55.36]I want you to really look corner to corner.
[384:57.74]There's gotta be something.
[384:59.38]I just don't think we have anything compelling.
[385:01.10]Oh.
[385:01.56]What's that?
[385:03.02]I don't know.
[385:03.36]What is it?
[385:04.42]It's a pipe.
[385:05.44]A lead pipe.
[385:07.52]Oh my god.
[385:08.10]And wait, where in a house would you find a lead pipe?
[385:10.46]That's so strange.
[385:12.23]Probably in the bathroom, I would say.
[385:14.01]Okay, yeah.
[385:14.47]I think you're right.
[385:15.07]Let's go to the next area.
[385:17.25]I guess.
[385:17.63]Okay.
[385:20.62]Oh shit.
[385:21.68]What the f- Wait.
[385:24.69]What the f- Wait, we're in the bathroom.
[385:28.79]Um, I don't know- Actually, for real though, it's a- I don't know why there's a house.
[385:34.45]There's a little doll place.
[385:36.69]Oh, in here?
[385:37.51]I promise you I have no idea why that's there.
[385:40.75]Just ignore that.
[385:42.07]Alright, completely ignored.
[385:43.24]Okay, yeah, ignore it.
[385:44.44]But I want you to look around, maybe there's a clue.
[385:47.32]God, there's got to be a clue.
[385:48.94]Oh, dude.
[385:49.76]Okay.
[385:50.14]Actually hiding things like an escape room.
[385:52.80]Philosophy.
[385:55.22]What is that?
[385:55.72]A mouse.
[385:58.12]A mouse?
[385:58.86]Wait, now where, where the hell would you find a mouse in a house?
[386:02.86]Oh, let me, what else is in here?
[386:06.26]Probably in the computer room, I would say, or an office, maybe.
[386:09.96]I think you're probably right.
[386:11.82]Let's go ahead and continue on.
[386:13.56]He was bleeding a lot.
[386:15.47]He was.
[386:15.95]A lot of blood in him.
[386:17.15]Okay, now, go ahead, open the door.
[386:21.57]Look up!
[386:21.93]There's an arrow!
[386:23.49]Let's go ahead and walk into that door, then.
[386:25.93]Oh!
[386:26.07]Oh my god!
[386:27.67]I fell down!
[386:29.70]What the?
[386:30.28]What the?
[386:30.92]What the heck just happened?
[386:33.22]What the flip?
[386:34.99]Let's go ahead and go in the door, I guess.
[386:36.97]I want to go in that one, but I... Okay.
[386:39.19]We have no choice.
[386:39.97]Yeah.
[386:41.17]Oh, my... I don't know.
[386:42.97]There's a bat there.
[386:45.13]I swear.
[386:46.25]I have no idea.
[386:47.39]Well, there's no blood on it.
[386:49.01]Sorry about that.
[386:49.53]There's no blood.
[386:50.39]It's clean.
[386:51.41]You're right.
[386:51.73]It's clean.
[386:52.55]There's got to be a clue somewhere as to where to go next.
[386:56.21]There just has to be.
[386:58.36]Oh, this, I love this.
[386:59.80]This is great.
[387:01.62]Okay, good.
[387:02.14]We got a bloody plate.
[387:03.94]A plate?
[387:04.52]Or is that just spaghetti?
[387:05.77]Like spaghetti sauce.
[387:07.97]You're the detective here, Jerma.
[387:09.03]I literally just made a house.
[387:10.53]I have no idea what's going on.
[387:12.59]A bloody plate.
[387:13.83]Now, where the hell do plates go?
[387:19.69]In the kitchen.
[387:20.17]Like I'm doing Dora the Explorer.
[387:22.67]That's right.
[387:25.30]Wait, what's this?
[387:27.82]Order more black ink.
[387:30.72]That's creepy.
[387:31.36]It's written in red.
[387:32.36]Could be blood, perhaps.
[387:34.25]That could be red blood ink.
[387:37.07]Wait, that's scary.
[387:38.65]Remember that.
[387:39.77]For the future.
[387:40.33]Alright, let's go ahead and keep going.
[387:41.71]Okay.
[387:46.83]Kitchen.
[387:49.31]This is very clean.
[387:50.89]I don't think there's any blood in this room, would you?
[387:53.19]Looks pretty good.
[387:54.07]I would say this is pretty clean.
[387:55.63]I don't think anything happened in here.
[387:57.72]Yeah, I don't think so.
[387:58.44]I mean, maybe there's a clue somewhere.
[387:59.76]I mean, God knows.
[388:02.14]Could be important.
[388:04.28]We have to get to the bottom of this.
[388:06.26]Okay, nothing in there.
[388:13.87]Whoa, alright.
[388:15.33]Bloody tennis ball.
[388:17.34]Wait.
[388:17.62]That kind of reminds me of something, Jeremiah.
[388:22.24]Yeah?
[388:24.04]Wait a second.
[388:24.94]Tennis?
[388:25.92]Yeah.
[388:28.09]Didn't we recently... Wait.
[388:30.87]We played tennis a few weeks ago.
[388:32.75]Like a month ago.
[388:34.07]Wait.
[388:34.57]Let's go ahead to the next room.
[388:36.69]Interesting.
[388:38.09]That is interesting.
[388:40.85]This is kind of creepy.
[388:41.71]This is scary.
[388:42.67]They don't have any only knives.
[388:44.11]They don't have any forks or knives.
[388:46.45]That is scary.
[388:56.80]This is actually kind of creepy.
[388:57.86]OK, what is this?
[389:00.28]I have no Jerma.
[389:01.38]I literally have no idea.
[389:02.50]I don't even know where you're going.
[389:06.30]My God, wait a second.
[389:09.34]Walk up to the mirror.
[389:11.72]Take a photo.
[389:13.00]Right click.
[389:14.44]Right click.
[389:15.36]Go into your photo.
[389:17.46]The murderer is right there.
[389:19.80]Jerma, the baseball bat was from your baseball event.
[389:23.79]Why was that there?
[389:25.03]In the beginning, the dollhouse.
[389:26.65]From the dollhouse event.
[389:28.11]Jerma, the tennis ball from Tennis Mania.
[389:32.37]Jerma, you killed Northernlion.
[389:34.77]That's all speculation.
[389:35.53]This whole time.
[389:36.89]That's all complete speculation.
[389:38.31]I've been here the whole time.
[389:40.89]It's impossible.
[389:41.55]There must be a clone.
[389:45.70]This was fucking awesome, dude.
[389:48.34]Is there more?
[389:49.82]Wait, there's a green screen behind you, too.
[389:51.78]Look at that picture.
[389:53.32]Whoa, there is a green screen.
[389:54.74]This whole time.
[389:55.52]Huh.
[389:56.96]Interesting.
[389:57.82]And that's it?
[389:59.18]Dude, alright, that was... Okay.
[390:01.96]This was very in-depth.
[390:04.16]You made a little, like, detective murder mystery, which is wonderful.
[390:10.23]Creativity, really high.
[390:12.09]Again, a lot of A's going out.
[390:14.65]But having, like, making me play, like, a game is really, really interesting to me.
[390:20.18]And that is...
[390:22.28]I think I'm just gonna give you a straight up it's high I've given so many grades today I don't remember what grades have gone out but creativity wise it's at least a 95. uh at least a 95. I'm gonna I'm in a 95 mood I'll take a 95 let's have a great
[390:44.18]Your philosophy is high, but you're also accusing me of killing someone.
[390:51.55]So I'm going to have to give you a couple of points deducted because I didn't do it.
[390:57.23]Okay.
[390:58.37]I believe you.
[390:59.21]Yeah.
[391:00.42]But anyways, I think that it's, I would give you a philosophy.
[391:02.89]I'm going to give you a, cause working with like a game like that is actually really cool.
[391:08.51]And by the way, the peas, your plating was a little weird.
[391:12.51]So, and the flavor of your broth was a little off.
[391:16.73]So I'm going to sit.
[391:17.83]Yeah.
[391:18.69]So I'm going to, I'm going to give you a 93 for philosophy.
[391:22.53]Okay.
[391:22.89]I'm going to give you
[391:25.77]Structural integrity is very, very good, too.
[391:28.31]I honestly can't see anything wrong with this at all.
[391:30.93]In fact, the way that you actually put this together was like a lot of actual building had to go into making it like this.
[391:39.52]So that's very, very well done.
[391:40.98]I'm going to give you a very high structural integrity score.
[391:43.04]What is chat's giving you?
[391:43.80]Ninety five.
[391:44.26]That's pretty good.
[391:46.06]This is going to be really close.
[391:47.32]There's like six teams that have at least like a like a high A. I'm going to give you structural integrity.
[391:54.08]A ninety seven.
[391:56.97]awesome I'll take it that was great you know you know what I don't think there was literally nothing wrong this was like a perfect house whoa like in regards to structure I mean like every door is in the right like look at this this is like perfect framing perfect walls I don't know if it could be lower hold on
[392:23.15]this stuff to here knowing that that's even a thing in the game.
[392:25.96]This is like all the lines or I don't even know how you did like lines like that in underground.
[392:33.18]Oh, it was on.
[392:33.74]That's right.
[392:34.29]It was it's all underground.
[392:35.69]Oh, shit.
[392:37.17]Wow.
[392:38.05]Okay, that I that's right.
[392:39.85]We did all that.
[392:40.69]Okay.
[392:42.29]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[392:42.81]You get 100 for structure.
[392:45.10]Let's go.
[392:45.94]Awesome.
[392:48.24]That was wonderful, dude.
[392:49.44]Seriously.
[392:50.56]Perfect.
[392:50.80]Thank you so much.
[392:51.80]Good luck with your move.
[392:53.18]You did great.
[392:53.60]Thank you very much.
[392:54.38]Thank you so much for inviting me.
[392:55.50]This was just a total blast.
[392:57.28]I really appreciate it.
[392:58.16]Yeah, dude.
[392:59.31]Talk to you soon.
[393:00.01]It's been a pleasure.
[393:02.03]Thank you.
[393:02.55]Bye-bye.
[393:03.09]Take care, Squeaks.
[393:03.65]That was Squeaks and Northernlion and their final grade.
[393:09.53]Oh, boy.
[393:10.13]It's high, isn't it?
[393:14.72]Where's their final grade?
[393:20.86]95.5.
[393:21.24]Just barely over Dug Dug and Ludwig at 95.49.
[393:29.63]Just barely under Poke and Ster at 96.
[393:35.69]Damn.
[393:36.95]Not like any of these grades matter.
[393:38.49]It's all just for fun.
[393:39.54]Alright, let's move this, let's move it along.
[393:41.32]So we got, uh, Crike and Etalyx and Will and F and Snuffy.
[393:45.51]I think Crike and Etalyx have just said they would, they don't care about going last.
[393:49.29]Hey, save, save the best for last, right?
[393:52.27]I mean, we're team nine, so we got to stick with that.
[393:54.69]Yeah.
[393:54.85]We're going last for everything else.
[393:56.24]I'm just comfortable there.
[393:57.62]Yeah.
[393:59.28]Okay, so Will, Neff, and Snuffy, thank you for being so patient.
[394:02.41]I know you've been hanging out for about like an hour and a half or so, just chilling.
[394:05.37]Hopefully you've been able to pass the time well, but I'm ready to see your house.
[394:10.61]Oh, you've been watching, baby.
[394:12.25]I'm very excited.
[394:13.77]I've been watching the house flips.
[394:17.27]Oh, boy.
[394:17.93]Oh, boy.
[394:19.22]Alright, I have a special request.
[394:22.34]Okay.
[394:23.66]um uh when you open it you're gonna you're gonna turn off the in-game music and you're gonna open up doom eternal demonic chanting extended mix okay I got you oh hell yeah okay it was doom eternal yeah demonic chanting
[394:46.65]demonic chanting extended extended okay yeah I'm gonna lower the volume just for a sec because this might be a little loud okay so I I got it playing on my end yeah but let me get the let me get this open let me make sure the audio is fine so it doesn't blow you out yeah it sounds like a good volume okay
[395:14.18]Let me get your house in here.
[395:16.78]Sure.
[395:18.29]I'll give you a little setup while you're loading it up.
[395:20.53]Yeah, give me a little context.
[395:22.69]So, you know, it's interesting.
[395:25.29]One of the categories is philosophy.
[395:28.51]And we really wanted to dig into that.
[395:32.29]And about a year or so ago, I don't know if you remember this, but it was kind of like that moment in that one soda commercial where the football player throws his jersey to the little kid and he's like, whoa, wow.
[395:47.90]And you gave me this moment where you're like, hey, Will, you've been doing cool stuff.
[395:51.84]you know I want you to do cool stuff in the future when I retire uh and then you you never retired but that that moment was huge and this building is actually a representation of what I plan um to do in the future and that is start uh the church of Jermas Christ wait say that one more time the church of Jermas Christ oh god
[396:18.87]Would you like to attend?
[396:20.87]So we want to spread Jermasism from the far corners of the globe.
[396:28.95]And we really incorporated, I think, a lot of what you practice and what you preach and what you do behind the scenes into our holy building here.
[396:40.04]Okay.
[396:41.04]Alright.
[396:41.86]Let me get this up.
[396:44.76]We bring you to our sanctuary.
[396:49.45]There it is.
[396:51.09]A retreat on holy land.
[396:52.71]There it is.
[396:57.10]Yeah, it takes a second or two to import it, just because it's... No worries.
[397:01.14]And make sure that chanting is right below an uncomfortable level.
[397:05.30]What'd you say?
[397:06.88]Sorry, make sure that chanting is good and dialed.
[397:10.03]Oh, yeah.
[397:10.51]You want it low?
[397:13.99]The opposite of that.
[397:14.99]Oh, you want it high.
[397:16.07]Okay.
[397:16.27]So you want this to be like, you want Guggadah.
[397:18.31]You want like Guggadah, Guggadah, Guggadah, Guggadah, Guggadah, Guggadah, Guggadah, Guggadah.
[397:21.65]It should.
[397:22.13]Yeah.
[397:22.75]We don't want it to drown us out, but it should definitely color the experience.
[397:29.07]You want it to make it feel like there's a companion by your side, even.
[397:32.35]This is going to be fucked, isn't it?
[397:37.37]It's not not fucked.
[397:42.47]Alright, so it should have gone in.
[397:46.77]Many other builds today have showcased us a very familiar face.
[397:51.25]It's actually sort of interesting if you think about it, how many people had a build that related to hell?
[397:58.25]Could it be that hell in house builder?
[398:01.75]I mean, we all know you can build underground.
[398:04.05]How far does the feature really go?
[398:07.77]Ooh, do I have the right file?
[398:10.61]This invitation to build a room?
[398:13.24]Is that the right one?
[398:14.52]I think it is.
[398:15.16]I think it's just saved the same name.
[398:16.78]Okay, cool.
[398:17.34]Just making sure.
[398:17.76]And you want me to do edit property or play?
[398:20.26]Edit is okay.
[398:21.42]You can clip.
[398:22.60]Okay.
[398:23.72]I don't want to look.
[398:24.64]I am going to just noclip out into nowhere.
[398:27.88]I'm not looking at all.
[398:28.82]Please let me know if I'm in the right spot.
[398:31.89]Oh, I think you might have loaded the scat dome again.
[398:35.48]Oh, God, the scat dome again.
[398:37.32]Wait, this is... That's the biggest problem, Jeremiah.
[398:42.22]We're going back to the scat dome.
[398:46.64]Okay, wait, let me check my files.
[398:47.98]I somehow must have overridden.
[398:50.96]That's crazy.
[398:51.98]I still cannot believe this one.
[398:53.56]This one is going to give me nightmares tonight.
[398:58.74]But this was so fucking funny.
[399:02.47]Where did I save the file?
[399:04.51]The scat dome.
[399:09.81]I just have to boot the game up really quick.
[399:13.19]I'm a scat man.
[399:22.97]Let me look at the grades again.
[399:26.43]Let's see.
[399:31.77]s fan and bonnie with the 76 that is I'm I'm impressed with that I'm happy with that yep I'm gonna quickly pee while it's loading good
[399:56.65]Yeah, as Ben and Bonnie, they got the key to the game and they got into the game.
[400:04.10]I believe it was three to four minutes before the stream started.
[400:09.58]Okay, I sent you a new one.
[400:11.34]I hope that works.
[400:12.76]Okay, let's see.
[400:14.48]It's still saved the same.
[400:19.26]Yeah, this this has a different file name.
[400:20.98]But if this one is the same size,
[400:26.67]Probably not a good sign.
[400:29.30]I don't know why it leads me to that one.
[400:31.60]Let me just delete all of these or something.
[400:33.76]Yeah, if you export it again, like if you like export to as a mod and see if it gives you like a different one, like in that same in the map that you're in.
[400:41.84]Yeah.
[400:52.39]Yeah, they all
[400:53.58]I think they're all 2000 kilobytes.
[400:58.02]Is that how big the one you got is?
[400:59.54]The one I have is 2.47.
[401:02.13]When I sit on Discord, they say 2.47.
[401:04.97]Just give that one a go, maybe?
[401:06.39]Yeah, I'll try this one.
[401:08.87]I will give this one a go.
[401:10.17]I have it pulled up on stream, so I don't know why it would still be saving as the old one.
[401:14.81]Clearly, I'm on the new one.
[401:25.39]it's so funny when I was like yeah I'm gonna try to keep this like around like five hours it's been like seven yeah a little over just a little just a little okay so let me make sure it's not is it oh it was it's a different place that's why I look okay I love it does it work this should work now
[401:49.37]Oh, thank goodness.
[401:50.53]Because this is definitely a different file.
[401:54.78]I'm going to noclip.
[401:58.20]I'm not looking.
[401:59.10]I'm just noclipping out of everywhere, and I'm just going to go this way.
[402:02.86]I don't know where I am.
[402:03.58]Is this a decent place to begin?
[402:06.98]Do you want to guide me in a different spot?
[402:10.72]I think that's good.
[402:15.77]yeah snuffy I can't see his I'll go to the Discord hold on yeah yeah yeah I think I think you're you're at least facing away from the building so I think that's probably fine yeah that's good okay let me get this on let me get the music on okay nice let me make sure like should I do you want to be in the front the god this is yeah the front's good the front's good front's a good place to start
[402:41.86]So this is the front right here.
[402:43.26]Okay.
[402:44.14]Alright.
[402:44.42]I am going to turn around.
[402:45.38]Yeah.
[402:45.68]There it is.
[402:47.98]Oh, boy.
[402:48.60]Okay.
[402:49.06]I'm going to start the music.
[402:50.90]Okay.
[402:51.68]The music is going.
[402:55.18]Yeah.
[402:57.15]Homie.
[403:00.61]What the fuck was that?
[403:03.91]Oh, homie.
[403:06.19]Welcome to our church, homie.
[403:11.25]you'll notice that we have the unholy mother on the outside of the church marge simpson and you'll notice that these are actually stained glass they go through if you go to the other side what yeah these are stained glass windows oh very clever very clever that's right uh so these these are stained glass windows that we've uh set up here yeah you can go ahead and close the door we
[403:36.72]We have our red carpet here, and you may peruse at your leisure.
[403:41.83]For our guests.
[403:48.91]Oh, yeah.
[403:49.17]Uh-huh.
[403:49.47]Oh, there's the Holy House.
[403:52.39]Oh, there we go.
[403:53.05]Now, if you hang a Louie, if you go to your left, you can go to the confessional booth that we built.
[404:02.14]Would you like to confess your sins, homie?
[404:07.29]Oh, homie.
[404:08.78]Marge, I ate one too many donuts today, and... You can't clip that, and there's no end-of-the-year award, so don't even think about it.
[404:19.00]How do I get into the conventional?
[404:20.95]You'll have to probably clip it.
[404:23.19]It's not very functional.
[404:24.51]Holy shit.
[404:25.51]Yeah, we had to fabricate this ourselves using tools.
[404:31.02]But there is no confessional option in the game, so Snuffy had to build one herself.
[404:37.71]Why not?
[404:38.59]Yeah, I know.
[404:39.61]We noticed that we were worried in the IKEA layout one that there would be an option for a confessional that we missed, but we had to build our own confessional.
[404:48.95]I see blood.
[404:49.51]There's blood on the ground.
[404:51.39]Yeah, there's some blood.
[404:53.83]Certainly.
[404:54.15]You shed your skin like your sin.
[404:57.82]And then if you look to your right, we actually built a pipe organ.
[405:01.06]Yeah, that's a pipe organ.
[405:04.20]Wait, right here?
[405:05.68]Yeah, that's a pipe organ.
[405:07.26]Go back, go back, go back.
[405:09.84]You've gone too far.
[405:10.52]You've gone too far.
[405:11.76]This is a pipe organ.
[405:13.47]Oh, this is beautiful.
[405:15.99]Yeah, that's a pipe organ.
[405:17.65]That also was not in the game.
[405:20.05]Hand-fabricated pipe organ there.
[405:23.87]Yeah.
[405:25.55]Hey, creativity, those are points.
[405:27.33]No.
[405:27.99]go to the other side yeah turn around like your skin and your sins there's something else that you'll be shedding your pants yeah right here like do I yeah yeah we also brought the poops elbow back we brought the poop you know some we gotta bring back the fan favorites you gotta bring the you gotta bring the poop back that's a yeah that's call back right there
[405:55.19]Alright, now on the other side.
[405:56.17]I'm good.
[405:56.49]I got it.
[405:57.39]We have the Tomb of the Unknown Jerma.
[406:00.59]Over here?
[406:01.73]Yeah.
[406:03.81]The son of the holy mother mind.
[406:06.81]Yeah.
[406:08.77]That's your... That's the last resting place.
[406:11.90]Where is this from?
[406:14.94]Did you make this?
[406:16.42]Yeah, we drew all these.
[406:20.10]These are all handcrafted.
[406:22.40]Yeah.
[406:23.30]Wow, you, wow!
[406:25.04]You, in 90 minutes!
[406:26.89]Holy shit!
[406:28.45]That's phenomenal!
[406:30.07]Yeah.
[406:30.63]Yeah, I painted that one myself.
[406:32.99]Just a little stained glass work.
[406:34.65]Yeah.
[406:36.75]And then if you go to the front, you have the, uh, the altar.
[406:40.15]Ah, yes.
[406:41.01]The sermon.
[406:42.43]Or the Jerma.
[406:46.17]That's a bucket of blood.
[406:47.83]Yeah, that's where you sip from the, the blood.
[406:51.92]Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[406:53.58]That's clever.
[406:54.88]That's a microphone.
[406:57.02]And that's a book of Jermas of Latter-day Saints right there.
[407:03.55]Now, if you want to turn off your clipping, you can fly out and see the shape of our cathedral, which is actually true to all cathedral shapes.
[407:13.77]They'll just fly right out?
[407:15.33]Yeah, fly right out, get a sky view of it, and you'll see that the Earth is cracked and broken around.
[407:24.68]Oh, yeah.
[407:26.76]It's in the shape of a cruciform.
[407:29.78]Whoa, okay, cool.
[407:32.00]Hell yeah, with more stained glass.
[407:35.15]Hey, that stained glass work, does it, you know, takes a while.
[407:38.49]Yeah, for sure, for sure.
[407:43.19]Oh, there's also another table of artwork.
[407:47.09]Oh, yeah.
[407:47.33]There's one more table.
[407:48.09]There's one more art table in here.
[407:50.63]It's across from the body.
[407:55.06]Oh, over here?
[407:55.90]Yeah, yeah.
[407:57.24]There you go.
[407:59.42]What is that?
[408:01.98]Oh, those are offerings for the night Jermas.
[408:08.64]Oh, I love that.
[408:09.18]Hey, that's my favorite food.
[408:11.76]Croissant.
[408:13.82]Yes, we knew this.
[408:14.60]You break bread with him.
[408:22.05]I'm getting very scary vibes from this guy.
[408:26.93]Don't be scared.
[408:28.07]Jermis loves you, and his message is that of blood, you know?
[408:35.66]The question is, you know, if God is omnipotent, aren't all evil things just as holy as those things that are considered pious and good?
[408:46.09]Without white, there can be no black.
[408:48.02]Without black, there can be no white.
[408:49.76]This is the teachings of Jermis.
[408:50.96]So it must be good to be evil sometimes.
[408:54.58]Uh-huh.
[408:54.94]Yep.
[408:55.92]Without evil, there could be no good, so it must be good to be... Oh, yeah.
[409:01.58]The big thing is, if you were worshipping... Any more?
[409:04.70]No, that's... Well, we have... That's the full church.
[409:07.46]The little rhyme on the back.
[409:10.18]Something, so a little jingle.
[409:11.68]It goes...
[409:24.24]You're supposed to give us an A. A. Oh, I'm supposed to say A back?
[409:30.82]Yeah.
[409:31.66]Oh, that was like a give us an A. Give us an S. Yeah, give us an A. Just in the words of the Holy Church.
[409:38.18]I see.
[409:38.52]Okay, okay.
[409:39.79]Yep.
[409:40.29]It's a little, it's a little call and repeat.
[409:42.35]This is a great, this is, okay, we've seen some church cathedral type stuff.
[409:46.82]We've seen some, you know, religion type stuff, but this is, this is a great cathedral.
[409:51.42]This is, this is a wonderful, okay, if you didn't tell me, I would have thought, like, this right here was from some kind of game.
[409:59.89]Like, this is from a game.
[410:00.57]Uh, oh, wow, what are you playing?
[410:02.13]Some, this looks like a, like a, like an old, like, PS2 game or PS3 game.
[410:06.31]What is this?
[410:07.69]So structurally, you did very, very well.
[410:11.20]It's a very big pain in the ass.
[410:12.92]One of the things with the fire for CDawg and Connors, putting down all these and making them custom images and doing all this, it's a lot of placement.
[410:22.30]It's a lot of time.
[410:23.94]So that's very, very good.
[410:26.57]Just as a whole, it's very cleanly made.
[410:30.61]It's very well made.
[410:31.57]I would say structurally, I think this is another A. I'm just throwing out the A's.
[410:36.65]I am.
[410:37.47]because thank you and then no I don't think anybody has nobody's head nobody's got like a fucking d no no d's that's not how it works uh I think this is like an I'm gonna give this a 90 I'm gonna give this a 90 I'm gonna give us a 95 for integrity oh thank you I don't have any I just don't have the only complaint that I have is this little tree
[411:00.47]Kind of sticking out there and a little bit.
[411:03.59]He told me to delete it.
[411:05.07]That was the only place it would accept it.
[411:07.18]And I feel like without that tree, it looked too empty because I also handcrafted the entire yard.
[411:11.98]I tried to really make it look like, you know, where you're in the wilderness.
[411:15.08]Also too.
[411:16.09]Desolate area.
[411:16.95]That's also another thing is, is, is the, the yard was not neglected.
[411:20.81]These here.
[411:23.15]I mean there are big spires of cracked Earth behind the house too if you want to check those yeah this this is this is not the default map right you guys all these trees oh yeah yeah all the trees and sticks and rocks and stuff yeah all the what are the topography right right yeah the the buds or something hey look at all these look at all these stalagmites what are the ones that grip still lag tight slag tights and stalagmites the ruptures of the Earth
[411:52.33]Very, very good.
[411:53.27]I love it.
[411:53.83]I think it's phenomenal.
[411:55.89]Structurally, 95.
[411:56.37]I'm going to give you creativity.
[411:58.36]It's very well made.
[411:59.36]I love the music.
[412:00.38]I love the story.
[412:02.36]I love the poetry that went behind everything.
[412:05.04]Creatively, I mean, Chat gave you a 95, I think.
[412:07.93]Let's see.
[412:08.23]Thank you.
[412:11.21]Chat's grade is, yeah, Chat's grade is a 95.
[412:13.49]Yeah.
[412:13.67]Chat loved all of these.
[412:20.84]My score creatively, I'm going to give you a 92.
[412:24.82]We'll take it.
[412:25.90]I think that's a solid A minus into A. The only reason why it's not even a little bit higher is the theming of the religion stuff.
[412:36.43]We've seen it a couple times.
[412:38.29]But this is very, very well done.
[412:41.62]And I get to be the main character, so that's fun too.
[412:46.34]Philosophy, you're also going to get...
[412:50.27]What about Marge?
[412:52.37]That's right.
[412:52.95]You did have like a... Oh, the Marge shit.
[412:55.73]It was... Everything else was so fucking cool.
[412:57.47]Over here, I like forgot the Marge stuff.
[413:00.21]Yeah.
[413:01.11]How can you forget me, homie?
[413:03.16]I mean, Philosophy, that's a callback.
[413:05.38]That's a reference and a callback to the last six to seven hours.
[413:09.88]Alright.
[413:10.16]So I think Philosophy, that's another high score.
[413:12.18]That's good. 90...
[413:24.42]90... 93?
[413:24.70]Okay, okay.
[413:27.50]Come.
[413:28.26]Alright.
[413:29.30]93?
[413:29.40]It's very, very good.
[413:31.08]It's very good.
[413:33.34]No.
[413:34.32]No.
[413:35.12]It's 94.
[413:37.16]Because you did multiple Marge voices.
[413:41.23]Yeah, yeah.
[413:42.57]I had the Satanic, like, ghost of Marge going on.
[413:45.77]Oh, me.
[413:49.11]And you had... Wait, that's a 95.
[413:51.09]Because you had a voice changer.
[413:53.32]This was very, this was unbelievably well made.
[413:57.54]This is very, very, very good.
[413:58.69]You guys rock.
[413:59.05]Your final grade, this was a 93.9, so it's technically 94.
[414:00.67]And your final grade was a 92.993.

[416:12.57]Yeah, we also have a song.
[416:13.97]That was a great idea.
[416:16.45]I would wait to play it or send it until after the initial... Until the map is at least in and people can see it.
[416:25.42]That way there's... The audio doesn't ruin the visual.
[416:30.54]I want to see if you can guess where we are when you load.
[416:33.64]Yeah, without saying anything.
[416:35.18]Yeah.

[416:39.76]When you load into our house, you know.
[416:42.70]Ah, okay.

[419:59.46]You'll notice that there is ancient text inscrawled upon the arch of this door.
[420:03.80]Do you have anyone in your party who might be able to translate that, or does it look familiar at all?
[420:09.88]Can anybody help?

[420:16.83]Is that Elvish?

[422:07.56]It's been so long since we've seen our Cousin Ballin, right, friend?
[422:11.84]Cousin Ballin?
[422:18.33]What is Cousin Balling?
[422:24.07]Have you seen this movie by any chance?
[422:30.67]I'm starting to realize that you may have not ever.
[422:33.67]This may be the last movie.
[422:37.23]Hold on.
[422:41.43]Are you unfamiliar with the story of the lonely mountain and the dragon Smaug by chance?
[422:48.43]I have, man, but the last time, I watched it like six years ago, and I may have been, I was probably fucking high.
[422:54.32]I don't remember the whole movie.
[422:56.40]Well, this will jog your memory like nothing else, let me tell you.
[423:00.89]Very accurate recreation.
[423:03.17]Also, in five days, it's the 22nd... Oh, shit, I just grabbed the door.
[423:07.04]My door!
[423:07.94]Okay, reset, reset.
[423:09.08]Okay, okay.
[423:09.76]In five days, what do we say?
[423:10.94]In five days, it's the 22nd anniversary of the release of this film.
[423:15.78]And so we thought, how to better pay homage than to accurately recreate... Oh, please.
[423:25.39]Just go ahead.
[423:26.47]Just go on.
[423:28.28]Welcome to the Mines of Moria!
[423:32.62]Oh shit!
[423:35.15]Just like the movie.
[423:38.15]This is no mine.
[423:41.18]It is a tomb.
[423:43.48]Shit.
[423:46.80]You remember that part?
[423:47.50]Yeah, and then Smaug comes out and goes, Oh, revenge!
[423:52.55]I will have my revenge!
[423:54.31]No, that was a historical event.
[423:55.91]No, that's The Hobbit.
[423:56.79]That's The Hobbit.
[423:57.31]That's a different one.
[423:57.89]Oh, it's a different movie.
[423:59.29]Yeah, different movie, but close.
[424:01.31]Similar energy.
[424:02.07]These are the dwarves.
[424:02.99]These are the dwarves?
[424:04.33]This is the era of Gimli, son of Gloin, son of Groin, son of Farron, son of Borin.
[424:10.92]This is the whole lineage of dwarves we kind of depict throughout the years.
[424:17.48]I think my spleen needs to get a fucking MRI after today.
[424:21.62]Every time I laugh fucking hard, it just, like, hurts.
[424:24.47]Alright, so this is Deep Rock Galactic?
[424:29.03]Well, those are some of... Listen, did you hear all the dwarves I just mentioned?
[424:32.31]We've got Gimli Glowen, Owen Growen, Dwalin Balin, Fundin Farin, Borin Dane... It's clearly been a while since you've seen the movie if you don't recognize the dwarves from it.
[424:40.63]Prancer, Vixen, Nixon, what are the other ones?
[424:45.59]Uh, Donner and Blitzen.
[424:46.91]Yeah.
[424:47.11]Okay.
[424:47.77]Very cool.
[424:48.43]Those are the guards.
[424:51.29]You can't cast them yet.
[424:53.87]Don't go past them.
[424:55.51]Those are the stone guardians.
[424:56.84]Yeah.
[424:57.32]Some dwarves didn't survive.
[424:59.00]If you look down, you'll notice.
[425:00.56]Oh, no!
[425:03.24]Yeah.
[425:04.62]He died with his weapons in hand, though, as any true dwarf would.
[425:09.30]And then, like, behind you.
[425:15.78]We're behind the giant photo of the... Sorry.
[425:19.65]Do you remember this part?
[425:23.55]Did you take that from my stream tonight?
[425:25.63]Because that's literally one of the screencaps.
[425:28.19]What?
[425:29.52]What are you talking about?
[425:30.42]That's like from my stream today.
[425:32.70]No, this is from a movie.
[425:34.16]Yeah, this is from a movie.
[425:35.94]This is from Lord of the Rings.
[425:37.30]This is the part where they go, claiming you did this.
[425:39.26]I'm talking about his expression and him being like,
[425:45.37]Oh, yeah.
[425:46.07]The fool of a took expression.
[425:47.31]Yeah.
[425:47.65]So.
[425:48.03]Fool of a took.
[425:49.23]Okay.
[425:49.91]Yep.
[425:50.29]Alright.
[425:50.73]That's the part when he pushes the.
[425:52.79]There's a bucket.
[425:53.85]The bucket.
[425:54.34]It goes down the well.
[425:55.36]He knocks a bucket.
[425:56.12]The song that you're listening to kind of starts like.
[425:58.94]Oh, shit.
[425:59.60]Okay.
[425:59.72]What's that?
[426:00.64]What's that?
[426:03.52]What is that?
[426:05.88]Careful.
[426:06.68]Don't.
[426:06.94]I'm trapped in a well at the bottom of Lemoria.
[426:15.09]I'm so glad to be on this stream finally.
[426:17.91]It's been so long.
[426:20.76]Who just did that?
[426:21.84]Who just did that?
[426:22.44]That was Etalyx, dude.
[426:23.34]He was saving that.
[426:25.50]Homie.
[426:26.10]What the fuck?
[426:28.34]You don't recognize me?
[426:31.70]That hurts me, homie.
[426:33.35]Holy shit.
[426:33.95]That's like the best Marge Simpson I think I've ever heard.
[426:37.21]I'm not kidding.
[426:37.87]That's probably the best I've ever heard.
[426:38.95]Ever.
[426:40.17]Ever.
[426:42.43]Oh, okay.
[426:43.13]That was unbelievable.
[426:45.39]Alright.
[426:45.73]I'm coming out.
[426:46.13]I'm going to come out of the well.
[426:47.85]I'm very careful that I don't accidentally see something I'm not supposed to.
[426:50.55]Alright.
[426:52.66]The dwarves guards are there.
[426:55.98]Are you ready, laddie, to continue through the mines of Moria?
[426:59.16]I am ready.
[427:01.98]Please don't take the door.
[427:04.88]You can open it and pass on through.
[427:06.74]Sorry.
[427:07.48]Okay.
[427:11.62]Now, the tombs are winding and intricate.
[427:13.72]Mm-hmm.
[427:15.30]Dwarves dig ever deeper.
[427:16.96]They do.
[427:18.02]And their greed sometimes gets them into unfortunate circumstances.
[427:23.75]And that's the face you're about to make.
[427:25.33]This is a warning.
[427:26.19]Because they have a cave troll.
[427:30.93]Cave troll!
[427:35.92]To your battle stations!
[427:37.58]Behind you, the Fellowship rides to your aid!
[427:40.18]Go up!
[427:40.92]Go up!
[427:43.06]Yes, Gandalf!
[427:44.92]Okay, yep, yep, I got it.
[427:48.03]The Fellowship is supporting you from the door that you came in.
[427:50.97]No, no, that's afterwards.
[427:52.41]That's the aftermath of defeating the troll.
[427:54.47]That's Harry Potter.
[427:55.57]That's not even the same movie.
[427:56.80]That's the cave troll.
[427:57.56]You're skipping the cutscene.
[427:58.54]The Fellowship's behind you.
[428:00.10]Behind you.
[428:01.26]The door you came in.
[428:01.90]Oh, they're there.
[428:02.56]Yeah, yeah.
[428:02.86]Now they're writing their arrows.
[428:04.84]The cave troll's coming.
[428:06.71]Okay, now... And then you fight them.
[428:09.39]They fight the cave troll.
[428:11.53]The T-posing cave troll.
[428:15.28]Yeah.
[428:17.45]Fuck, it hurts.
[428:19.51]Okay.
[428:20.41]This is for after you've defeated the cave troll.
[428:22.53]Bro, that's not Harry Potter?
[428:24.60]No, no, this is Lord of the Rings.
[428:28.06]They stick a splinter up his nose and then he falls over.
[428:31.58]I'm so fucked up.
[428:32.68]I don't know, I thought that was like fucking Harry, like right on his head.
[428:36.11]I don't know, I was like, that didn't happen, did it?
[428:38.43]No, it didn't happen.
[428:40.96]Alright.
[428:41.96]They have taken the bridge and the second hall.
[428:45.44]We have barred the gates, but cannot hold them for long.
[428:48.91]The ground shakes.
[428:50.53]Drums!
[428:51.75]Drums in the deep!
[428:53.13]Drums in the deep!
[428:54.11]We cannot get out.
[428:55.37]A shadow moves in the dark.
[428:57.35]We cannot get out.
[428:59.05]They are coming.
[428:59.93]We must get out.
[429:01.91]Stop, dude!
[429:05.96]We flanned this.
[429:08.87]Thank you.
[429:10.29]Shit, this is fucking awesome.
[429:13.59]Oh, it's the Balrog of Morgott.
[429:17.01]On your left.
[429:18.07]Oh, shit.
[429:21.43]Whoa.
[429:22.41]Okay, this is awesome.
[429:23.74]This floor is unbelievable.
[429:26.98]I am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of honor.
[429:31.28]You shall not...
[429:36.19]The dark fire will not avail you.
[429:38.29]Flame of Udurun, go back to the shadow.
[429:44.39]And then he falls.
[429:45.15]Boom.
[429:45.75]Yeah, and then he falls.
[429:46.53]I don't know if you remember.
[429:47.51]It's been a while since he's seen the movie.
[429:49.52]But he breaks the bridge.
[429:51.64]Yep.
[429:54.52]He falls in.
[429:55.22]And then he fights.
[429:56.78]He falls in.
[429:58.94]Fly, you fools.
[430:02.42]And then it runs.
[430:02.90]Is that right here?
[430:05.44]Oh.
[430:05.98]Behind you.
[430:07.77]Could you be watched by a crawler in the deep?
[430:12.85]Oh shit.
[430:14.91]Okay.
[430:16.27]Alright.
[430:17.37]Okay.
[430:32.98]No, I will not give it to you.
[430:35.46]We need to destroy this trinket on Mount Doom, and we need to get there in at least two more movies from now, right?
[430:44.72]Yeah, yeah, we didn't have the budget to make Mount Doom, unfortunately, so this is about as far as we got.
[430:50.87]Yeah, but then the Fellowship is supposed to retreat after this.
[430:54.03]Oh, shit, I'm gonna get up.
[430:54.97]Fly, you fools.
[430:56.49]So you can literally fly if you want to.
[430:57.73]You have the ability to fly, yeah.
[430:59.29]No!
[431:01.86]There you go.
[431:02.62]Welcome to Elrond's house.
[431:03.84]That's not ours, but this is like the vacation home after you get out of Moria.
[431:08.00]I want to see what this looks like.
[431:09.12]Yeah.
[431:09.46]I was gonna say, another enclosure, which is very, very clever.
[431:11.56]We were trying to make it night, because they arrive to Moria at night.
[431:17.83]So we tried to create an artificial night, since we couldn't figure out how to change the time of day.
[431:22.03]And this is sort of the back of the mountain.
[431:24.78]Now this is this is unbelievably good.
[431:26.68]That was fucking awesome.
[431:29.60]I love the enclosure.
[431:33.19]keeping it kind of condensed in this spot yeah so it's not like oh look there's like a ted's house over there right um so that that's really immersive really great I like I love the lore I love the story uh that you all you made this up right I mean this is not from a movie or a television we wanted to use all of the space yeah so we used as high as we could go with the you can't go as high with the terrain tool as you can with the build tool so we went as high with the
[432:01.89]terrain tool as we can and then we are using the entire below ground area and you can't fall through you can actually jump off and we have lava like little little rocks for the ball rock so awesome okay well this is high this is very good music the voice acting the the the the theme it was like wow we were like in a little play that was wonderful uh so let's get the grade up and these are your final grades
[432:30.99]Oh, let's get this up.
[432:31.69]I want to make it bigger so we can kind of get a good view of it.
[432:34.71]And again, the grades, it's just for fun.
[432:37.07]I don't want anyone to feel bad.
[432:38.37]It was just us fucking around.
[432:40.53]There's no stakes or anything.
[432:41.55]It's just for fun.
[432:43.38]But Alex and Criken, unbelievable job.
[432:45.88]Thank you so much.
[432:46.54]I'm going to give you for structural integrity.
[432:48.62]Let's do that first.
[432:49.22]Structurally, this is a, as you see, I can pick it up.
[432:53.84]That was so fun.
[432:54.56]Dude, it was hurting me every time I clicked on a door and you were like, stop clicking the door.
[432:58.48]Oh my God, I'm going to puke.
[433:01.24]I would give this a very high because... Hold on a second here.
[433:07.78]Now, the thing about mines is they are underground and tree systems have massive roots that actually...
[433:15.19]break through cavernous areas a lot.
[433:17.21]So it would be not accurate to not show the root system of trees if this were actually a mine of Moria.
[433:24.89]That is a great point.
[433:25.93]You know, that's it.
[433:26.65]You sold me.
[433:27.99]But yeah, all these things are very, very clean.
[433:30.83]All the paintings are well.
[433:31.99]Look at the pillars.
[433:32.75]I mean, look at the ceiling.
[433:34.62]You guys had to make a roof on top of this.
[433:36.32]I didn't even know this was the roof.
[433:37.12]This is the roof of the house, isn't it?
[433:39.77]Yeah, we had to hide the... You can't see the dirt mountain from anywhere inside of the exhibit area.
[433:46.10]Yeah.
[433:46.86]Because the lighting is weird.
[433:47.86]And we hoped that by blocking out the sun, it would make actual shadow.
[433:51.27]But I think it's just like...
[433:54.10]I don't think, honestly, like, I don't think there's very much wrong with this.
[433:57.90]I think this is another 1-0-0 structure.
[434:01.28]Ooh, thank you.
[434:03.22]I just, there could be some, but this is just, it's wonderful.
[434:06.83]Like, all the going down, all the verticality, it's just, this was a huge pain in the ass.
[434:12.47]I know it, because I just tried to make one that did this similarly, and it was dog shit.
[434:19.65]So, you guys did a fucking great job.
[434:21.85]uh chat has given you a 95 and a chat has been given a's as well uh pretty much everything everybody got an a don't try to diminish this yeah yeah glorious achievement for recognizing chat room 95 this is why we went last so we didn't uh tilt the curve of chat 95 so we wanted everyone else to have a shot first
[434:44.66]Yeah, my build that I did, I'll show it.
[434:47.88]I'll show it to whoever wants to see it.
[434:49.80]I did have, I had to pause at help.
[434:53.62]So I only had like maybe 28 minutes of build time in the 90 minutes.
[434:57.43]But I tried to do an underground thing and I gave up immediately because I was like, nope, I'll figure that out later.
[435:02.65]So it was awful.
[435:03.91]But you guys did a fucking awesome job.
[435:06.11]Creativity and philosophy.
[435:08.51]You're going to get the same grade.
[435:10.67]The same exact grade for both of these.
[435:13.12]It's very high.
[435:13.96]I loved the philosophy of doing Lord of the Rings.
[435:18.26]We're going through the actual Balrog Mountain.
[435:21.84]I appreciate it.
[435:23.40]I think it's going to be 90... I think, honestly, we just go straight up.
[435:28.99]It's like 96, 96...
[435:33.43]We were trying to do something that we didn't think anyone else would do.
[435:36.59]We're making a house in House Flipper for the peoples who live below.
[435:41.41]The little folk.
[435:43.67]And a lot of dwarves lived here.
[435:46.38]It's seen better days, obviously.
[435:48.64]But, you know, it's still a memorial.
[435:50.40]Yeah, you honestly create 98 creativity.
[435:55.70]Not 96, 98, because this is like a whole play.
[435:58.32]That was great.
[436:01.97]Thanks, boss.
[436:03.37]Thank you.
[436:03.59]There's also the marge.
[436:05.46]It was the whole marge.
[436:08.08]By the way, Etalyx had been saving that.
[436:10.26]He had mentioned that he could do a mean marge.
[436:13.98]We put an Easter egg and you found the Easter egg because we knew you would look in the well.
[436:20.68]That was great.
[436:22.60]Phenomenal work.
[436:23.52]Your final grade for this was a 97.5, which is one of the highest.
[436:27.92]I think it is the highest.
[436:31.35]uh I think yeah this is this is the highest score I think for the for the double build 97.5 but well done again these grades are not I don't want anybody to think that like oh I've only got like two more points now that's not what it's about this is just this grading systems for fun but yeah that is the end of everybody's final grades
[437:01.05]For some reason, Marge always comes off sexy.
[437:03.01]It's always like horny Marge.
[437:05.13]There's no non-horny Marge voice.
[437:07.35]Homie, come here.
[437:08.99]Yeah, see?
[437:09.47]There's like no way to do her voice without doing that.
[437:11.98]I could try.
[437:12.62]Go for it.
[437:14.38]I've tried it a few times, but I don't think, no, no way.
[437:19.48]No.
[437:20.22]That was a bird.
[437:23.14]That was not real, by the way.
[437:28.06]Alright.
[437:28.52]Thank you, Etalyx.
[437:29.20]Thank you, Criken.
[437:30.86]Phenomenal job, as I expected, considering how creative the both of you are.
[437:36.98]Excellent, excellent work.
[437:40.62]Thank you so much.
[437:42.48]And with that, I'm going to show my build to whoever is still here.
[437:46.24]I know it's like been nine fucking hours or something.
[437:49.61]I'm going to see it.
[437:51.07]Oh, I'm here.
[437:52.13]This is the treat after the end, the present.
[437:54.20]This is the... Can we judge you?
[437:56.58]Yes.
[437:57.26]But I have a bunch of... There's a bunch of caveats here.
[438:00.30]Oh.
[438:00.76]But let's go over this first.
[438:03.66]The top three.
[438:06.40]Let's see.
[438:06.68]Who is top three?
[438:08.74]We got overall... Everybody did really fucking... Everybody did really well.
[438:20.99]95.4.
[438:21.01]We got DougDoug and Ludwig at 95.5.
[438:27.12]95.49.
[438:28.36]We've got Squeaks and Northernlion at 95.52.
[438:33.52]Barely just beating Ludwig and DougDoug.
[438:38.85]Ster and Poke with 96.
[438:45.67]Ster and Poke are the highest score.
[438:50.41]So it's Ster and Poke.
[438:51.95]We were held back by our first two.
[438:54.23]Which were like 85s.
[438:56.50]Congrats to Stern Poke.
[438:57.88]Congratulations.
[438:59.20]But you guys were right.
[439:00.22]Everybody was just right there.
[439:01.53]It was 95.4, 93.3, 93.7.
[439:01.79]You guys were 93.7.
[439:02.13]I mean, it's literally inches.
[439:03.77]We will congratulate everyone who won on behalf of those who are sleeping now.
[439:06.77]Snuffy and Will, 92.9.
[439:07.15]This is great.
[439:26.70]Did Ezfan do a Marge impression?
[439:31.24]Yes, at some point.
[439:35.51]However, that's an actual question.
[439:39.67]I think at this point, every single person did.
[439:41.91]Yeah.
[439:42.89]Yeah, throw a couple points on creativity for Ezfan and Bonnie.
[439:48.38]Because there was a Marge impression.
[439:53.24]Oh, homie.
[439:59.99]Alright, I'm going to show you mine, because why not?
[440:03.03]Did I even save the game?
[440:04.17]I hope not.
[440:05.09]I mean, I hope I didn't.
[440:05.93]Everyone loves Marge.
[440:09.59]My favorite character.
[440:13.61]Can anybody do a Homer?
[440:16.25]My Troy McClure is pretty close to Troy McClure.
[440:19.57]It is.
[440:19.93]Hi, I'm Troy McClure.
[440:23.45]You might remember me from such films as Christmas Abe 2, Revenge of the Christmas Abe.
[440:30.89]I can only do Lois instead of Marge.
[440:33.13]Your Lois is good.
[440:35.34]Really?
[440:36.38]Really good.
[440:37.06]I was in the fact that you kept with it throughout the tour.
[440:40.08]I was very impressed.
[440:42.46]Where the hell's my house?
[440:44.26]The drama is here.
[440:45.60]Did I not save the house I was working on?
[440:53.99]No, I definitely did, right?
[441:00.48]How convenient, when we finally get to judge, a dog ate his homework.
[441:06.48]Did I not save?
[441:07.56]I thought I did.
[441:08.76]Yeah, I definitely saved it.
[441:09.84]Maybe it's just... Hold on.
[441:12.16]Because it normally would be right here.
[441:16.32]Huh.
[441:17.43]Maybe not.
[441:17.91]Oh, there it is.
[441:18.39]Okay.
[441:19.19]Alright.
[441:20.05]Ladies and gentlemen, if you are here, keep in mind, don't look at the screen yet, because I want to make sure that I get to do my tour.
[441:28.71]Okay.
[441:28.83]Yep.
[441:31.58]don't look somebody looked okay you can look uh I'm going to put my own music on oh okay oh so we should go look at your stream yeah sure and I'm gonna I'm gonna okay let's see
[441:55.09]Okay, what happens if I just type... I'm just going to pick whatever the first one is.
[441:58.26]I'm going to do it.
[441:59.00]I don't even know what this is.
[442:00.34]I typed in something very specific.
[442:06.04]And let's see if it works out.
[442:13.86]I typed in magical fairy music.
[442:17.24]Hopefully it works.
[442:19.42]Which one?
[442:20.74]I'm on YouTube.
[442:22.56]Whatever the first one is.
[442:23.58]Secrets of the Fairies.
[442:27.93]Okay, let me paint you a picture here.
[442:32.03]We're in a forest.
[442:34.52]And this sense of berries, strawberries, blueberries.
[442:40.00]There's a light humidity in the air.
[442:44.26]Crisp.
[442:47.21]Welcome home.
[442:51.01]Welcome to the home of the elves.
[442:55.49]What kind of elves are we talking about here?
[442:56.99]Well, obviously ones that live in a tree.
[443:01.53]As we see, we enter here in the building.
[443:04.21]Beautiful, beautiful topography here.
[443:06.72]Dirt mounds.
[443:08.78]Dirt mounds.
[443:09.90]Yeah.
[443:10.20]It almost looks like a face.
[443:11.88]Yep.
[443:12.90]Almost.
[443:14.08]Go up here just to show you a little bit of... I'll show you around a little.
[443:16.26]This is the kind of living... One of the living areas out here.
[443:19.26]As we see, we have... We're having multiple little nooks to go in.
[443:22.44]This is where they sleep.
[443:25.87]Be careful, though.
[443:26.45]Okay, we're good?
[443:31.44]Okay, we're good.
[443:31.82]Yeah, crouch... gamers can crouch jump.
[443:33.72]Take a look at this.
[443:34.18]So here we go.
[443:34.94]This is where... This is where the high elf sleeps.
[443:41.13]Where do the other ones sleep?
[443:43.51]The other elves sleep up here.
[443:47.17]Oh, he had an answer for that.
[443:48.34]Yeah, that was... I thought I had a curveball.
[443:51.96]And they make very, very delicious cookies.
[443:54.84]They work day and night making the best cookies you could possibly get.
[443:59.32]These are elves that love pastries.
[444:01.30]They love sweets.
[444:03.58]Are they ever at risk of, like, falling off their bed?
[444:09.86]Like, if they're a restless sleeper, what if they take the tumble?
[444:14.68]Yeah, I mean, that's a
[444:16.43]But they're elves.
[444:17.19]Elves always land on their feet.
[444:19.69]They're like cats.
[444:22.49]But if you fall out of this one, you'll just fall in the pool.
[444:24.49]I don't know why there's a pool here.
[444:27.15]It's so... Okay, so... Let's go over a couple other things, too.
[444:30.32]But that's not it.
[444:31.22]You've got your magical fairy house.
[444:32.88]A wooden tree.
[444:34.22]A tree house.
[444:36.06]Wait, what about... What's down here?
[444:38.10]A room system.
[444:40.32]A magical tunnel!
[444:42.86]Leading...
[444:44.14]to what looks like the end of a yard sale.
[444:48.27]Wow.
[444:49.63]I'm feeling magic around me already.
[444:53.33]All these flowers and... Ooh, and what does this sign say?
[444:57.25]It's not supposed to say that.
[445:01.88]It's supposed to say... It's supposed to say, thank you for playing in the House Slipper 2 Invitational.
[445:08.20]It's been a blast.
[445:11.04]and I uh here's my explanation for why this is so scuffed uh I built this in over the course of those 90 minutes I just I was like talking to chat and talking to some of you guys and I peed I wouldn't go I wouldn't eat something I think I built this for like 27 total minutes did you clean up the pee that's what the pool is
[445:38.49]I mean, you know what they say, you don't have to be a chef to be a food critic.
[445:44.52]Yeah, I think this is so cool.
[445:46.18]I had a theme going if I if I had like another hour, maybe, but like this is like, look at this, like, oh, let me put lamps down.
[445:52.33]That makes sense to me.
[445:53.17]Like magical mushrooms.
[445:55.33]Yeah, they look like little mushrooms.
[445:56.89]Yeah.
[445:57.15]Creativity definitely is your strongest score here.
[446:01.77]I don't know.
[446:02.07]Do you guys have numbers in mind?
[446:03.25]Oh, yeah.
[446:04.70]Yeah.
[446:04.94]What's the ranking?
[446:05.90]I would say 60.
[446:07.24]Creativity is very high.
[446:09.96]I like the philosophy on, like, a beautiful, hidden, almost, uh... I don't know.
[446:18.40]The facade looks like a Majora's Mask mask.
[446:21.78]Yeah, or like one of those little things from Animal Crossing that make noises.
[446:26.07]Yeah, the gyroids.
[446:28.21]Yeah.
[446:31.05]Well, what does Chat give?
[446:32.39]Chat gave a...
[446:35.69]A D. Oh, nice.
[446:39.77]I'll give it a 76.
[446:40.23]Hey, alright.
[446:41.69]I'll take it.
[446:42.05]I would say creativity is like a 90 something.
[446:47.83]Yeah.
[446:48.13]Structure, you've got some holes in the underground.
[446:50.28]Oh, there are a lot of issues.
[446:54.69]I think the overall theme though carries a lot like the creativity.
[446:57.99]I love the plants on the branches.
[447:00.82]It really makes it look like a true tree.
[447:02.64]The texture is practically perfect.
[447:05.04]Same shade of color as the other trees.
[447:07.60]I really appreciate that.
[447:08.86]I feel like it just is very tied in well.
[447:11.47]I still don't know what the difference in creativity and philosophy is.
[447:14.45]Yeah, I don't think anyone does.
[447:15.89]The philosophical process of the elves.
[447:18.94]I do think that the social kind of hierarchy you built between the high elf having a double bed and all the worker elves in a more precarious position in single beds.
[447:28.66]And it's actually a lot more dangerous up here than it is here.
[447:31.23]Yeah.
[447:31.77]Oh, yeah.
[447:32.93]If you fall from here.
[447:33.57]Their lives are valued more.
[447:35.05]I mean, this is a hospital visit, but I think you'll be alright.
[447:38.18]We might be persuaded to bump up the score with a certain impression.
[447:42.61]Oh.
[447:44.25]I don't know about that.
[447:45.25]I don't know.
[447:52.01]Can I get 1 point?
[447:54.09]Yeah you get a point.
[447:56.01]Can I get to 61?
[448:06.02]That's so funny.
[448:08.02]See?
[448:08.28]They're always sexy Marge.
[448:09.42]There's no such thing as a non-sexy Marge.
[448:11.98]Oh my god.
[448:13.68]I'm dying on that.
[448:14.42]Okay, maybe I sound corrected.
[448:17.16]Alright, I have a very special thank you to make for everybody here.
[448:22.34]First of all, House Flipper 2's developers, they helped us get a lot of this off the ground, because obviously the game came out today, and we had to get this set up over the last couple of days, two or three days, so...
[448:33.08]they did let us in early to be able to kind of set everything up so house number two devs hell yeah thank you so much uh I'll be playing it all weekend uh I'll be sponsored to play it over the weekend too so that's really cool I love this franchise I spent a ton of time in this franchise so that's a no-brainer um obviously thanks for that as well House Flipper
[448:52.28]But, yeah.
[448:53.92]After that, CDawg, Conradespants, thank you so much.
[448:57.12]DougDoug, Ludwig, RT, Kiwo, Vinny, Joel, NorthernLions, Squeaks, Ezfan, Bonnie, Poke, Ster, Wilnef, Stuffy, Etalyx, and Criken, obviously.
[449:04.72]Thank you guys so much.
[449:06.02]Thanks for reading those subs.
[449:11.90]god damn it uh but that was wonderful uh hope you all had a good time I know it was late I know it was long but I thought that was a really really fun time thank you for participating thanks for hanging out yeah thank you for having me it was a lot of fun I know right yeah timeline wise I guess House Flipper 3 is due out like in the next couple months based on the
[449:38.63]you know, proximity of the competition to each game's release date.
[449:42.23]Yeah, true.
[449:45.90]Okay.
[449:46.84]Alright, I'll talk to you guys later.

[449:51.32]Thank you, guys.
[449:51.86]Thank you.
[449:52.32]Good night.
[449:52.88]Bye.
[449:54.64]Good night, AP Chatters.
[449:57.23]Yeah, huge shout out to the mods too.
[449:59.67]Mods, Holly did a ton of help working on this, helping get things set up.
[450:04.88]Because something that is interesting to note, trying to juggle around almost 20 streamers is not as easy as it might sound.
[450:14.80]There's a lot of people, a lot of time zones, a lot of moving parts.
[450:20.26]I'm just glad everybody had a good time.
[450:22.47]And yeah.
[450:24.88]That was really fun.
[450:26.54]I will see you tomorrow.
[450:27.96]I'm streaming tomorrow.
[450:28.94]I'm sponsored to play House Slipper 2 over the weekend.
[450:32.46]I'll be live tomorrow, probably earlier than you are used to.
[450:36.53]I think mid-morning, early afternoon.
[450:39.05]I'll get it in the sus.
[450:41.13]But I'm just going to play.
[450:43.15]I want to do the kind of new game, do the tutorial, play through it just because I want to see it.
[450:47.65]Because obviously I'm a huge fan of this game, so I want to see it.
[450:50.44]And we'll see you tomorrow.
[450:57.37]That is not, there's nothing there.
[451:02.51]Hey, there you go.
[451:08.61]Ow, ow, ow, ow.
[451:10.49]Yeah, did you guys have a good time?
[451:12.79]How do you guys feel?
[451:13.35]You guys feel good?
[451:17.80]This is seven and a half hours.
[451:19.40]We went over by like two hours.
[451:21.66]God, I feel so bad.
[451:29.26]Hey, but as long as we had fun.
[451:34.21]I'm going to let the credits play out.
[451:35.17]I'm going to go pee.
[451:36.43]I've had to for a little while.
[451:39.05]But I got to go to the bathroom and then I will put the outro out.
[451:47.72]There's a fucking shitload of subs.
[451:49.70]Is that am I reading that right?
[451:53.76]They're like 60 pages.
[451:58.85]I guess I haven't streamed in a little while, I guess.
[452:02.07]And again, yeah, I will say this too.
[452:03.57]I know that I'm like, as of now, pretty much retired from streaming.
[452:08.70]But I'm still here.
[452:10.36]Obviously, I'm playing the game for the next like three days in a row.
[452:12.86]I'm not going anywhere.
[452:14.36]But subscribing to the channel, I didn't put the thing in the Discord and I want to.
[452:18.74]But because I'm only going to be streaming really sporadically, once every...
[452:24.47]few weeks sometimes maybe sometimes even longer than that sometimes shorter than that just be aware of if you don't think that's worth paying for I don't want you to pay it so as I go into this period where I'm going to be just kind of floating around doing stuff a few times a week maybe like a few times a month sometimes an outlier will happen and I'll get the urge to come on and play for like a week
[452:49.64]But I do appreciate people subbing still.
[452:51.82]This is like crazy to see, but I'm going to discourage it.
[452:55.78]So I am officially telling you right now, I'm going to start officially discouraging subscriptions to the channel.
[453:03.71]I cannot force you to do that, but I am going to tell you that you're probably only going to see me a few times a month.
[453:17.14]So I would like it to be worth it to you.
[453:21.04]But I'll see you tomorrow.
[453:23.24]I'll see you tomorrow.
[453:24.22]I'll see you Saturday.
[453:25.14]And I'll see you Sunday.
[453:25.84]We're going to go three days in a row.
[453:27.48]They're not going to be super long streams.
[453:29.74]They'll be maybe three, four hours each.
[453:32.46]Maybe a little bit longer.
[453:33.24]Depends on how into it I am.
[453:38.96]Today was my last time subbing.
[453:40.26]No hard feelings.
[453:40.92]Want to help out some smaller streamers?
[453:42.26]100%.
[453:43.22]Absolutely. 100%.
[453:49.86]There are a lot of people on this website that deserve your sub.
[453:55.20]Absolutely.
[453:56.94]And with that, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[453:58.52]I'll, uh, what time?
[454:00.00]Maybe I'll give you guys check us in the next couple of hours.
[454:05.34]I'll get it in there.
[454:07.62]Have a wonderful, wonderful rest of your evening.
[454:13.39]massive shout out to everybody everybody showed up I know it's like it's it's tough with a lot of these streamers and a lot of you know the friends of mine is so busy and they get so much shit going on and I I'm just really happy that it worked out thank you so much coming out you know I've broken record at this point but I'm gonna take a bath
[454:44.60]Who's still streaming right now?
[454:49.02]I haven't rated it.
[454:50.10]I haven't rated in like six months.

[455:28.46]We'll dump you on Snuffy.
