[00:05.02]Hello Descenters, my name is Etalyx and I am here today to show you the Wild West themed shooter that just came out on Steam very recently called Fistful of Frags.
[00:14.95]This game is a game I'm going to try my best to show why everybody should be playing it, because it is great.
[00:22.13]I was so surprised.
[00:23.82]Oh, what's this, a mod on Steam that I should be playing?
[00:26.08]Okay, like there's not a thousand of those already, but something special.
[00:29.68]about Fistful of Frags.
[00:30.76]I think it all comes down to the satisfaction of shooting.
[00:34.78]Now, primarily in this gameplay series of clips I'm going to have for you here, most of the time I'm going to be using the Smith Carbine, which is a single-shot gun.
[00:43.65]But it does so much damage, a lot of the time you're going to get one-hit kills.
[00:47.57]But it's kind of a catch-give-and-take.
[00:49.85]You have to aim carefully.
[00:51.89]because if you miss, you have a really long reload time.
[00:54.27]All the weapons in this game have extra long reloads, so every shot counts, and that's what makes it so satisfying and gratifying when you land those kills.
[01:01.44]Now within this series of clips, I also wanna mention that I am playing with Jerma and Boo, so if you stick around to the end of my post commentary here, you're gonna see a few live clips that are pretty fun too, I like to think.
[01:11.30]Now, the reason everyone should be playing this game, it's not just a mod for a game that you have to buy.
[01:15.73]No, it's free!
[01:16.89]All you have to do is go on Steam, download it, and you can start playing right now.
[01:20.91]So links to everybody's channel who I'm playing with, as well as the game itself, down below, so I encourage you to check that out.
[01:26.93]So going back to the game proper, there's a lot more than you could do than just that single shot beast of a carbine there.
[01:32.94]You can dual wield pistols too, but it's not as OP as it sounds because you take a hit in accuracy, so you have to be careful about that, and also, you have to reload each gun individually.
[01:42.56]So that can take some time as you're about to see because they don't just disappear off screen and magically pop back up fully reloaded like they do in other games with dual wielding.
[01:51.52]No, you gotta sit there and watch your guy refill each gun one bullet at a time and I think it's great.
[01:57.93]I think it does slow the pacing down but just enough so that it makes it really scary when you start click click clicking on your gun realizing that you are out of ammo.
[02:06.87]You have to find a safe place to hide, maybe get a friend to cover you if you're playing in the team mode of the game.
[02:12.41]Somehow it strikes a keen balance between arcade action and strategic tactical gameplay.
[02:19.39]I don't know how, but it's very thrilling when you get kills.
[02:22.06]Have you ever played Red Orchestra?
[02:23.96]It kind of reminds me of that with the satisfaction of getting the kills because in Red Orchestra, it's so difficult.
[02:30.60]but when you finally do land those kills, you rejoice, you cheer, you let out a little squeal.
[02:36.24]In this game, similarly, when I get the kills, I am just going nuts.
[02:39.52]I'm saying the nerdiest of nerd gaming things, like, get owned!
[02:42.55]Oh, I turned on the beast mode!
[02:44.79]Just stupid things that you don't want anyone else hearing, which is why I cut that stupid dialog out, and here I am talking to you right now about why you should play, by the way, Karate Kick.
[02:53.23]That's a thing, too.
[02:55.17]It feels so good.
[02:56.51]Okay, so yes, when you kick people, they actually push them back, so a fun combination is to kick them and then shoot them while they're still floating backwards.
[03:03.99]You also have a variety of equipment that you can put on, like special boots that increase the durability of the, not the durability, the power of your kicks, so you kick harder, farther,
[03:14.82]and with more damage, and you can also throw knives, as I may have mentioned already, and even throw your pistol at the enemy.
[03:21.64]Oh, you shot all your bullets, don't have time to reload?
[03:23.68]Throw the pistol as a last resort.
[03:25.66]So many crazy shenanigans can happen in a single game that it just is different every single time I play.
[03:31.13]On top of all that, the game has an interesting way of scoring.
[03:34.19]You know how in Team Fortress 2 it doesn't keep track of your KDR so that you don't have to worry if you're doing poorly?
[03:40.25]No one else will know except for you.
[03:41.95]You'll just be low on the scoreboard.
[03:43.97]Here, something similar takes place.
[03:46.45]You get kills based on how difficult those kills were.
[03:49.47]So the harder it is to get those kills, maybe say punching someone with your fists in the face, you get more points, and the more points you get, the more notoriety you have, and the more notoriety you have, the higher up the leaderboards you go.
[04:00.98]Now, I'm not 100% certain, but I feel like killing people with higher notoriety gives you more notoriety, but I could be wrong on that.
[04:06.89]It just seems like that's how it played out while I was playing.
[04:09.99]I think what blows my mind the most about this game is that it's completely free.
[04:14.11]I've played a lot of shooters over the last few years, and this is among the best, if not the best, out of the ones that I've played.
[04:20.08]And by the way, if you're watching this video and you're not sure if I'm getting kills or not, there's an easy way to tell.
[04:24.66]Anytime that amazing music goes, that means I got a kill.
[04:30.25]Using your pistols to quick-shoot as fast as you can and then watching someone toss some TNT right into the mix and blow somebody sky-high is oh so satisfying.
[04:39.02]And I think that's really the name of this game.
[04:41.48]Satisfying.
[04:42.62]It's just fun.
[04:43.70]That's really the bottom line.
[04:45.28]You don't need any spray-and-pray automatic weapons.
[04:47.83]Oh, here's one of my favorite kills right here.
[04:50.00]Throw some TNT into an explosive barrel and the ragdoll physics just take over from there.
[04:54.50]You just got a bunch of Old West Civil War era historical guns.
[04:58.63]I just have always wanted to see a Civil War era game and everyone's always told me, Etalyx, it'd be no fun having to just one shot and then you have to reload for like 30 seconds.
[05:09.94]This game is kind of a testament to some happy medium between that and the modern-day shooters because, like I said, the reloads are infinitely long.
[05:19.17]But the fact is that the bullets are more realistic in that one shot can sometimes be one kill and that is all it takes to make a good game, I think.
[05:27.36]Having to shoot somebody six times, like in Battlefield, it's just not satisfying for me anymore.
[05:32.22]That's why I'm leaning more towards shooters like this, and like Red Orchestra 2.
[05:36.14]But anyways, I think I've talked long enough.
[05:37.64]I got a few live clips for you here coming up in just a second.
[05:40.99]I hope you enjoyed this video, and if you want to see more Fistful of Frags videos in the future, please let me know by leaving a like on the videos that you enjoy.
[05:48.25]And of course, let me know your comments and your thoughts below.
[05:51.69]Especially considering that I rarely do any shooting content, shooty-shooty shooter content on my channel.
[05:57.43]But I want to thank you guys so much for watching, and I hope you enjoy this video, and I hope you enjoy these next couple clips.
[06:04.15]Nice attack.
[06:05.11]Get no scoped.
[06:07.81]Help.
[06:09.21]In here.
[06:10.85]Oh!
[06:11.77]Did you just get a... Yeah.
[06:14.01]A Collat?
[06:14.67]Yeah.
[06:16.27]Nice.
[06:16.85]Wow, those guys lined up perfectly.
[06:18.94]I just got lucky, but I'm going to say it was skill.
[06:23.96]What have I done?
[06:26.29]I'll protect you, Jerma.
[06:27.31]You just threw a hat.
[06:29.25]I just protected your life, Jerma.
[06:31.19]That guy right there?
[06:31.91]There's another guy.
[06:33.44]Got him again?
[06:34.08]Thank you.
[06:34.78]Thanks for protecting my life.
[06:36.32]I'm having computer issues.
[06:37.84]Alright, let's go.
[06:38.34]Why did you throw a hat, and how did you do that?
[06:41.06]How the hell did I do that?
[06:42.22]I don't know.
[06:42.84]I just saw you do it.
[06:44.04]Like, a hat came out of your inventory.
[06:45.25]I threw my hat.
[06:46.31]No, you still have a hat, but a hat, like, came out of you.
[06:49.57]Oh.
[06:49.91]I don't know.
[06:56.48]Oh my god, I wish I had a grenade right now.
[06:59.96]Across the way.
[07:00.46]Across the way.
[07:01.00]Yeah, across.
[07:01.40]Yup, yup, yup.
[07:02.99]Duck.
[07:03.37]Duck and cover.
[07:07.53]How did you die?
[07:08.35]I killed Jerma.
[07:10.17]You threw a knife at me.
[07:11.75]I threw a knife at you and I, like, jumped and killed myself off the edge.
[07:17.15]No!
[07:17.65]Take that, Boo!
[07:18.55]I've avenged Jerma!
[07:21.29]We've got a friendly throwing knives at us.
[07:22.78]I'm gonna find a crate.
[07:32.68]I'm gonna go up.
[07:33.72]I'm going up more.
[07:35.00]Oh, find it.
[07:35.76]I'm here.
[07:37.90]Oh wow, that's a lot of people.
[07:42.46]Wow.
[07:42.98]Wow.
[07:43.68]We just totally just cleaned up that.
[07:46.14]I gotta reload.
[07:46.88]I gotta reload.
[07:48.56]Oh god.
[07:48.98]Is that boo?
[07:50.36]No.
[07:50.42]Oh god, no!
[07:50.82]I'm surrounded.
[07:51.82]I have the same idea.
[08:00.94]I'm just, like, scared how high he is.
[08:02.97]He's dead.
[08:04.77]I just right-clicked and it shot.
[08:07.81]I bet you shoot, like, one from each barrel or something.
[08:09.89]I don't know.
[08:16.19]Oh, I get it.
[08:16.81]Right.
[08:17.43]With the coach gun, if you left-click, it does, like, one shot, one shot, and then you reload.
[08:20.77]But if you right-click, it shoots both at the same time for a huge blast, I guess.
[08:26.29]That's pretty cool.
[08:28.87]I got the shotgun.
[08:33.63]That's so powerful!
