[ve:60.16.100]

[00:27.09]no not pre-recorded not yet not yet hello hi hi everybody welcome back well kinda welcome half back right I mean is this The Simpsons hit and run stream or is this me talking to you now I don't know did I do this in the beginning of The Simpsons hit and run VOD
[00:58.46]Why would I be referencing The Simpsons hit-and-run VOD during The Simpsons hit-and-run stream?
[01:03.92]See, that's where you gotta fucking take a look.
[01:10.05]The audio's too high-pitched.
[01:12.81]Hey!
[01:14.15]I haven't even been back in the seat for more than five minutes and we're already talking about my shitty audio.
[01:19.20]Let me fix it.
[01:19.70]Is it better?
[01:23.82]Can you hear me?
[01:27.50]Do I sound better now?
[01:28.16]Did my voice change in three weeks?
[01:33.44]I mean, I've been, like, being quiet.
[01:35.12]I haven't been really yelling or anything.
[01:40.92]It's been so long.
[01:42.32]I know, but let me... Look, look, look, look.
[01:44.80]I didn't want to just turn... Somebody just gave 100 community subs.
[01:48.26]Alright, Zixia gave 100 subs.
[01:51.24]Thanks for the 100 community subs.
[01:57.35]Thank you.
[01:58.51]That's a shitload.
[01:59.57]That's a lot of money.
[02:00.77]That's a lot.
[02:01.58]That is a lot.
[02:02.20]That's too many.
[02:05.64]Uh, but hi.
[02:07.60]That's a lot.
[02:08.32]Alright, hi.
[02:09.60]I'm back.
[02:10.80]For now.
[02:11.44]For right now.
[02:12.82]I'm gonna go over a bunch of things.
[02:14.62]I'm gonna spend a little bit of time talking to you guys.
[02:17.99]Kind of about the state of things.
[02:20.61]Where I stand medically.
[02:22.61]And some potentially fun things coming in the future.
[02:28.74]Yeah, welcome back for now.
[02:29.60]Yeah, for right now.
[02:31.48]First thing is first, I am not back.
[02:34.16]This is not a return stream.
[02:37.68]I'm not streaming in this chair.
[02:40.00]I decided to sit here for about 20, 30 minutes.
[02:43.36]To make sure people is clear what's going on and what I'm doing.
[02:45.86]Because like I said, I don't want to just turn the stream on and have it be like, oh yeah, it's just a VOD.
[02:52.47]Where the fuck is he?
[02:53.19]Like, I don't understand.
[02:56.15]Speaking of not understanding, I just got another 100 community subs from Freddie Dredd.
[03:00.70]Freddie Dredd, 100 subs, 100, 200 subs, back-to-back.
[03:04.61]Those are back-to-back-to-back jacks.
[03:07.69]Oh, funny, speaking of back-to-back-to-back jacks at baseball.
[03:12.59]It's not completely signed and set in stone yet, because we're still waiting for a few things.
[03:18.93]But over the last few weeks, I've been in the chat, in the Discord, and going back and forth about a potential stream that will be happening in August.
[03:28.19]It's tentative.
[03:30.43]I've talked about this baseball stream.
[03:36.04]and we're we're very very it's it looks like it's gonna be a reality I don't want to get I don't want to talk about that much about it yet because we're still waiting for some things obviously we're in the middle of like the coronavirus the pandemic is still here we need to make sure that we're safe about that we do the right protocols
[03:54.84]But it's looking more and more and more likely that the Jerma Baseball Association stream will be a reality sooner than you think.
[04:11.61]Now, those of you that don't know what this is, good.
[04:14.73]Because I don't... Good.
[04:16.35]It's going to be great when you see it.
[04:19.11]This is going to be...
[04:23.89]No, I don't want to talk about it.
[04:25.79]There's still a chance that it might not happen.
[04:27.38]You know what I mean?
[04:28.62]I don't want to get ahead of myself.
[04:32.72]Yes, it's the fucking cartoon baseball league.
[04:35.82]It's the fucking clowns versus the magicians.
[04:40.93]That's all you're getting.
[04:41.71]That's all you're getting.
[04:44.91]And it might be here in like a month and a half.
[04:50.87]I've been working on this shit for the last few weeks anyways without again It's still tentative the we're still waiting on if that will be real or not lots of moving parts there I'm excited though very excited But an epic baseball moment
[05:13.75]But first of all, there's been tons of money coming through.
[05:17.35]One thing I do want to make pretty clear is I will not be doing any bit readings or anything at the end of the streams, especially considering this stream is 11 hours long.
[05:26.82]So that's why I wanted to start it now.
[05:30.82]Because it's going to be over at like 10, 11 o'clock at night Pacific as of if I start it right now.
[05:39.31]This is an 11 hour stream.
[05:41.99]Those of you that didn't watch the stream, I have to be, I gotta be upfront with you.
[05:46.08]This is a mess.
[05:48.70]I, I know that I actually get really mad and it sucks.
[05:53.19]It sucks knowing that like, I'm going to replay like out of the 11 hours, there's probably at least two to three hours where like, I'm visibly upset.
[06:00.15]And it's like, oh, I already did that, but now we're going to re-experience it, I guess.
[06:07.53]I think there's like three raids that happened too to the stream during the middle of this, so it's gonna be funny when I'm like, oh hey, thanks for the raid, Nova!
[06:15.36]It's like he, that was like fucking two years ago.
[06:17.82]Hey, but hey, but Nova, hey, thanks for the raid.
[06:21.36]I really appreciate that when it happened.
[06:26.76]That's another reason why I don't wanna do an outro or an intro to these because I'm gonna be, you know what, maybe who fucking cares.
[06:33.88]I'll at least let the intros play.
[06:38.09]But thanks for the huge amount of subs and the huge amount of money.
[06:42.33]We had $25 from Ben Elnor.
[06:44.35]They say welcome back.
[06:45.29]Not quite.
[06:49.57]$10 from It's No Conspiracy.
[06:52.37]Thanks for the $10.
[06:52.73]They say welcome back.
[06:53.85]Not quite.
[06:54.41]This is really pre-recorded.
[07:00.28]Yeah.
[07:00.96]It's been a while.
[07:02.68]I actually enjoy sitting here.
[07:05.89]How's the health?
[07:06.37]Alright, let's go over the health.
[07:08.01]Uh, so I am in the process right now.
[07:10.77]I was on a stint of prednisone, uh, last week.
[07:14.71]Didn't really do very much.
[07:15.57]Uh, I have been seen by a few more doctors.
[07:19.29]I have two or three more appointments coming up in the next two or three days.
[07:23.33]I have some scans that are awaiting, uh, me to do them in the next couple days.
[07:29.29]One thing that I did find out is, uh...
[07:35.07]It's kind of... I don't know if... We're not sure if it has anything to really do with the problem of the kind of low back pain and chest pain and everything.
[07:46.25]But I have a prostate problem.
[07:50.83]I had that checked.
[07:51.97]And I'm currently being treated for a prostate problem.
[07:56.91]And we don't know if that is possible to cause the pain that I'm getting, but it might be two or three different things happening at the same time.
[08:10.08]So, that's the one thing that's come out of all this.
[08:12.96]Is, oh, you... We gotta keep an eye on your prostate.
[08:17.24]It's... I've been diagnosed with prostatitis.
[08:22.67]That might not be what the problem is.
[08:24.39]That might just be, I happen to have caught that.
[08:29.95]Because we were doing a lot of exams.
[08:33.33]There you go.
[08:34.81]I'm gonna be transparent with you.
[08:35.83]What do you want me to tell you?
[08:36.71]What do you want me to say?
[08:40.05]Well, you know, there's a... I got diagnosed with a thing down below, and it's the place where you... I'm an adult.
[08:50.89]You're an adult.
[08:51.93]We're all adults here.
[08:53.17]How old are you?
[08:54.45]Are you adults?
[08:55.02]Are you an adult?
[08:56.12]Hey, you gotta be 18 to watch this stream.
[08:58.08]Look, when you clicked on it, you had to say you were 18.
[08:59.80]Right?
[09:03.72]Did you have to say that?
[09:06.38]It's a mature audience, right?
[09:09.41]We're all adults here.
[09:10.48]Just relax.
[09:15.16]We got a bunch more money.
[09:17.30]Mostly loss gave $50.
[09:18.28]I've barely eaten out in months.
[09:22.40]So I have some of the money I've saved from being fiscally responsible.
[09:25.81]Quick question.
[09:26.35]Did you go on a rant a few years back about hating when pets have normal human names or am I confusing you with somebody else?
[09:31.95]That was me.
[09:33.53]Yeah.
[09:34.41]That was me.
[09:36.26]Yes, I... If your dog's name is David, that's... Come on.
[09:42.55]Yes, I did have a problem with that.
[09:49.23]Otto.
[09:49.71]No, but Otto is different.
[09:52.97]Otto is a human name.
[09:57.63]Don't make me laugh.
[09:58.51]I'm supposed to not be here right now.
[10:03.02]All of my dogs have had human names.
[10:05.07]I'm coming to this realization.
[10:06.71]No.
[10:06.95]Alright.
[10:07.27]Some human names.
[10:08.13]Alright.
[10:08.33]Let's put it this way.
[10:10.11]Like Otto.
[10:12.09]Simon.
[10:13.25]Right.
[10:13.51]Okay.
[10:14.05]Those are like, but like if your dog's name is Steve.
[10:20.65]That's not right.
[10:26.78]Like if your dog's name was Chris.
[10:30.73]Like, Otto is, like, it's not a common name.
[10:35.29]Simon's not, like, if your dog's name was Chris, wouldn't that be kind of weird?
[10:40.12]It's a very common name.
[10:41.66]Like, John.
[10:44.10]Hey, come here, John!
[10:44.80]Like, J-O-H-N.
[10:48.54]Nobody's dog's name is John, okay?
[10:51.58]So, no, I'm dead serious about this.
[10:54.88]There's nobody in this chat has ever heard of anybody who has a dog named Christopher.
[11:00.46]I guarantee it.
[11:09.88]My name is John.
[11:11.05]Yeah, your name is John.
[11:12.07]You're not your dog.
[11:13.17]Are you?
[11:20.08]Wait a minute.
[11:21.72]My name is John.
[11:23.90]Yeah, you're not the dog.
[11:30.05]But anyways, I'm still working on it.
[11:32.87]I've got... There's a lot of things that my doctor has now that they didn't have before.
[11:39.78]I'm currently on antibiotics to see if that helps with this prostate thing.
[11:46.94]And who knows, guys?
[11:47.82]Here's the thing about medical bullshit.
[11:51.23]I don't know.
[11:51.71]I have no idea.
[11:53.11]This could have been like a prostate problem that just was radiating through my whole body.
[11:58.45]It's possible.
[11:59.27]I don't know.
[11:59.55]I don't know how probable that is.
[12:01.26]But let's just say after a stint of being on the antibiotics, if I go back to normal, if it's over, like, oh, that was it.
[12:07.26]It's possible.
[12:08.75]And if that's the reality, then I'm coming back.
[12:11.31]I'm not going to be gone until July.
[12:13.49]I don't think that's the case, though.
[12:20.30]Because there's a lot more going on.
[12:23.34]But it might be contributing to some of the reasons why I feel the way that I do.
[12:28.92]Prostate radiates.
[12:34.01]When is the rumble?
[12:35.81]Oh.
[12:36.75]Well, that's... That's a hot... That's a loaded... That's a hot question.
[12:42.79]He has a radioactive prostate.
[12:44.95]No, I'm fine.
[12:48.07]Guys, your prostate is not like your bum.
[12:51.05]It's like... It's your... It's underneath your... It's underneath your... Your... It's underneath your...
[13:04.91]Duh.
[13:05.83]Get it?
[13:06.75]Come on.
[13:07.35]Get out of here.
[13:11.96]Say it.
[13:13.02]I already did.
[13:13.50]Hey, Goiki, thanks for the $50.
[13:16.36]I'm gonna rename my dog Jeremy.
[13:18.02]Also, we missed you.
[13:19.12]I'm about to leave.
[13:20.88]Well, I'm about to leave, but I'm about to be replaced by another me from a year ago.
[13:26.99]Thanks for the 50 fucking bucks.
[13:28.19]Thank you, One Dimensional Gamer.
[13:29.89]$50.
[13:30.13]Get your butt better.
[13:30.87]It's not my butt.
[13:32.71]It's something else.
[13:36.50]Take care of yourselves, guys.
[13:40.81]Be replaced.
[13:41.59]Well, I'm being replaced.
[13:43.23]Current me is being replaced by past me.
[13:47.35]Alright, fuck it.
[13:47.90]Let's just play Jump King.
[13:48.86]Let's go.
[13:49.16]DLC.
[13:54.97]Not fucking doing that.
[13:57.47]Hey, first live, coming back.
[14:00.24]Tentatively, TM.
[14:03.46]But let me thank you for the $50.
[14:04.56]Hey, here's $50 to help with your radioactive ass.
[14:08.70]What a shitty superpower that would be.
[14:13.54]I'm Radioactive Man.
[14:15.50]Oh, cool.
[14:16.10]Wow, that means you must have superpowers.
[14:17.70]Where do you have the radioactivity?
[14:19.86]It's just my ass.
[14:22.35]Wait, what do you mean?
[14:23.81]Yes, I have radioactive ass.
[14:27.86]So, does that mean, like... Do you have any powers, or is your ass just green, or... Yes.
[14:37.52]Can you do anything?
[14:38.40]Nope.
[14:39.16]No, it's just kind of like, when I sit down, it kind of burns seats.
[14:43.71]Real pain in the ass on the subway, I'll tell you.
[14:49.43]He's got a nuclear ass.
[15:01.50]Please fix your asshole.
[15:03.08]Hey, guys, I don't even know if that's the... I'm just trying... Look, I've taken a time off, and I'm going to continue to take a lot of time off.
[15:11.06]I want to... I've got to tell you guys what's going on.
[15:13.16]I'm not just going to disappear and be like, yeah, well, we'll see.
[15:20.39]When I figure out, when I get news, I'm going to tell you.
[15:24.61]Why wouldn't I?
[15:29.15]This stream is 11 hours long.
[15:30.77]I really gotta get it started, but here's the takeaway here.
[15:34.51]Over the next few weeks, there's going to be a rerun like this.
[15:40.59]Probably once every, I don't know, maybe once or twice a week?
[15:44.80]Here's the thing I said in the pre-stream chat.
[15:46.96]I've had, hey, just, why don't you just run tons of reruns?
[15:49.80]Just 24-7.
[15:50.18]No, no.
[15:51.56]I am not gonna be friends on every fucking network.
[15:55.43]Okay?
[15:56.31]Okay?
[15:57.53]I'm not just gonna run my entire backlog over and over again 24-7.
[16:00.27]No.
[16:00.59]Like this ain't gonna be like TBS at 3 in the afternoon.
[16:11.01]Till like midnight.
[16:15.67]No one told you life was gonna be this way.
[16:23.70]Let's just put that before every rerun.
[16:30.98]The most fun you can have with singing the Friends song is that first part.
[16:38.22]So no one told you... It's the T and the O. You can tell you're a singer if you can get that.
[16:45.07]So no one told you life was... That's why everyone sings that song.
[16:48.83]It's the only fun part.
[16:53.81]Alright, I'm out of here.
[16:55.28]Have fun watching this stream.
[16:57.10]I'll pop in from time to time.
[16:58.66]Make sure the stream is still on.
[17:02.11]I guess it might like turn off This is another hundred dollars Jesus Christ, thank you devil devil X for the 10,000 bits Jeremy my boy don't break dance again.
[17:20.48]So you aren't out of commission for another three weeks Well, I am good.
[17:25.61]I am NOT here.
[17:27.85]I am NOT here
[17:32.81]Just pretend I wasn't here.
[17:33.77]That's another hundred community subs.
[17:37.17]That's another hundred subs from Zyxia.
[17:42.09]My goodness.
[17:44.33]That's so many subs.
[17:47.05]Some of us.
[17:49.47]Take three weeks off, come back to like 500 subs in a row.
[17:53.15]Something else that I want to bring up just real quick before we get to the, you know, the regularly scheduled programming.
[18:01.20]Um,
[18:03.13]A ton of you have stayed subbed.
[18:05.43]More than I thought were going to.
[18:06.87]I mean, you haven't gotten your money's worth for the last month.
[18:13.35]At all.
[18:14.79]So the fact that there's this many people that are still going to do that is... I can't even believe it.
[18:21.13]I cannot even fucking believe it.
[18:22.48]So, thank you.
[18:27.21]Hopefully over these next couple of months, you will start to see some of these projects that in the absence I've been... FTK is coming back.
[18:36.18]And it's going to be a real deal.
[18:37.46]It's not just going to be a mess like it was last time.
[18:41.01]Baseball stream.
[18:41.71]This is within the next 30 to 60 days.
[18:45.87]These two things.
[18:49.13]I cannot wait for this baseball stream.
[18:50.61]I really hope it goes through.
[18:53.78]I really hope that this actually ends up working out.
[18:55.70]Because it's going to be ridiculous.
[18:57.98]I am as excited about this baseball stream as I was about the carnival.
[19:06.80]So, if that tells you anything, then here you go.
[19:16.03]But, I am going to let this play because, like I said, it is early.
[19:19.95]It's in the morning right now.
[19:23.79]I'm going to let this play out.
[19:27.77]It is 11 hours.
[19:28.63]Those of you that did not get to catch this the first time, I hope you enjoy it.
[19:33.17]Please don't hate me after this, though.
[19:37.40]We talk about The Simpsons hit and run stream, but we never show the whole thing uninterrupted without commercial breaks or any breaks or anything.
[19:43.56]We don't show the whole thing.
[19:45.10]We reference it.
[19:47.97]And now it's about to be played again.
[19:51.78]Like, I've seen clips.
[19:53.77]Oh yeah, that's like 12 seconds.
[19:55.03]This is 11 hours.
[19:55.67]Anywho.
[20:00.47]It's good to talk to you guys again.
[20:01.61]Good to see you again.
[20:02.47]And I've been around.
[20:03.43]I've been jumping into the Discord and into the just offline chat.
[20:07.94]You'll see me.
[20:10.34]I will be back.
[20:12.84]I can tell you with the utmost certainty at this point that I will be back streaming normally.
[20:21.82]by the second, probably second or third week of July.
[20:26.12]I'm looking at like somewhere around July, like 15th, 16th, 17th.
[20:35.01]I really don't think this is going to take that much longer than that.
[20:39.99]I really don't think so.
[20:43.03]So in the meantime, though, once or twice a week, we're going to, I'll pop in.
[20:46.17]We'll do a rerun.
[20:46.97]We'll chill for a little bit like we are now.
[20:51.74]And we'll go from here.
[20:53.68]So without further ado.
[20:56.16]Thank you everybody.
[20:56.86]I will not be doing any bit readings after the stream.
[21:00.58]Any money, any huge amounts of subs is incredibly fucking appreciated.
[21:04.33]And I can't even believe people would be doing it.
[21:06.89]But I will not be here to interact with them.
[21:15.47]Have fun.
[21:16.75]It's time to start the show.
[21:21.33]Oh.
[21:22.88]Very important.
[21:24.44]I almost forgot.
[21:25.16]Gotta give you a quick little look at me.
[21:35.45]Oh yeah, we're going from here to there.
[21:39.41]Your stream is not broken.
[21:41.41]It's not frozen.
[21:42.24]There's not a problem.
[21:49.08]Okay.
[21:49.54]It's not frozen.
[21:51.12]It's not.
[21:51.56]You're good.
[21:53.63]Wait, hold on.
[21:54.85]Oh, shit.
[21:57.91]I think I have to go into my computer settings and make it so the computer doesn't power down automatically or go into standby mode after like six hours of not doing anything, right?
[22:06.33]Is that going to happen?
[22:10.10]Is my computer going to just go into sleep mode?
[22:13.02]Like in three hours?
[22:16.34]I'll check back if it did.
[22:17.72]I'll take care of it.
[22:23.72]I'm gonna come back and jiggle the mouse, like, every six hours.
[22:32.01]It's gonna be... I'm not gonna be able to hide it.
[22:33.95]You're gonna see every, like, two hours, like... It's gonna piss off so many people.
[22:42.04]Alright, goodbye.
[22:42.76]I'll see you later.
[22:43.34]We'll let the intro play.
[22:44.26]Remember, this is from, like, 2019.
[22:47.08]This is from, like, almost two years ago.
[22:52.30]Alright, how do I just plus?
[22:53.60]Do I just start it or what?
[22:55.54]Do I just press play?
[22:56.34]I don't like this.
[23:00.32]It's weird.
[23:00.70]I've never done this before.
[23:08.31]You got homer, you got mod, you got bot.
[23:11.49]Alright.
[23:12.61]Throw them in the same place at the same time.
[23:15.77]They're all driving fucking cars around.
[23:18.77]That's the plan for tonight.
[23:19.77]How you guys doing?
[23:22.79]I want to sit here for this.
[23:23.67]I want to see what I have to say.
[23:25.21]Let's see what the intro from two years ago was like.
[23:27.21]Simpsons hit and run.
[23:28.29]Got it to work.
[23:29.69]That, check it off.
[23:30.45]Technical difficulties.
[23:31.27]It was a theory that I might not have gotten it to work.
[23:34.99]But we delayed.
[23:37.88]And, uh... Kill code came through with the... That's right.
[23:43.60]Some files.
[23:44.36]Some patches.
[23:46.24]And I was like, well, would you look at that?
[23:48.72]Would you look at me?
[23:51.91]So we can play it.
[23:54.41]I own it on PlayStation 2, but I figured try to get it on PC to work, right?
[24:04.08]So paranoid about the computer.
[24:05.86]I'm just going to sip my coffee and make sure I have my OBS configured.
[24:10.37]I'll see you guys real soon.
[24:14.82]I start so quickly.
[24:16.98]Guys, seriously, like, the stream turned on and like we're ready to go in like fucking three minutes.
[24:26.94]I am very, very prompt with how I start my streams.
[24:34.95]Dude, let's go.
[24:36.39]Hurry up.
[24:36.87]Hurry up.
[24:37.29]Let's go.
[24:37.83]I just turned it on.
[24:46.84]You're gonna hear that as shitload.
[24:49.10]It ain't even been two minutes.
[24:58.07]I'm gonna go, right?
[25:01.17]Should I get out of here?
[25:02.45]This is for you guys to see the fun rerun, right?
[25:04.95]Should I get out?
[25:05.29]I'm gonna go.
[25:10.61]That just kind of jumped out at you, didn't it?
[25:12.07]Sorry about that.
[25:13.71]I thought that was on my computer right now.
[25:19.38]I can't believe I'm turning this on.
[25:21.00]I'm sorry.
[25:23.38]I can't believe I'm turning this on.
[25:24.34]I'm going to turn this off at 11 o'clock.
[25:26.00]What am I going to do all day?
[25:26.74]You know what I would love?
[25:28.63]I would love if OBS had a feature where I could, like, when I activate a source, right?
[25:35.11]And maybe they do.
[25:35.75]Hold on.
[25:38.35]Turn that down for a second.
[25:39.85]If I could, like, have a way, there's a plugin where I can make it so every time I activate a source, it slowly comes up from zero.
[25:48.89]That might be hard to do, but... Man, I wish I could do that.
[25:51.47]Some of these games... They just blow your ears out.
[25:54.17]Hey, by the way, two years later, that fucking feature don't exist.
[25:57.71]Uh, here it is.
[25:59.33]Simpsons Hit and Run working on PC.
[26:01.97]This is actually on PC, and there are, like, a bunch of mods and shit that you need to have to get this to work.
[26:08.82]So... It is possible.
[26:14.83]I don't have any, like, funny mods.
[26:16.37]This is not like a funny mod thing.
[26:18.53]11 hour commentary.
[26:19.35]Alright, I have to leave.
[26:20.95]I've never done this before.
[26:21.71]I don't know what to do.
[26:22.55]Do I stay here?
[26:23.54]No, I'm gonna go.
[26:24.40]It's 11 hours.
[26:25.68]No, I can't.
[26:26.32]I gotta go.
[26:27.62]Are you ready?
[26:28.72]How do we get audio?
[26:30.10]Alright.
[26:33.81]It's not a funny mod.
[26:38.07]Oh.
[26:41.98]I feel like this is cheating!
[26:43.46]Ow!
[26:44.06]Alright, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye!
[26:49.78]How's that?
[26:50.92]That's probably better.
[26:53.13]So you can still hear me.
[26:54.25]What do we got?
[26:58.95]So we got... And plus I can have a controller plugged in.
[27:01.41]That's the best part.
[27:01.91]I'm gonna scare the shit out of you guys later, I promise.
[27:04.53]Alright.
[27:04.99]People have been waiting for this for a long time.
[27:08.75]I don't see enough hype in the chat right now.
[27:11.04]You know, I want you all to spell it out in one gigantic letter.
[27:15.26]You know, you all have to work on H. And then P. And then E. The one ResidentSleeper.
[27:31.37]And you stand out so much.
[27:35.33]If you're a ResidentSleeper right now, you are.
[27:37.71]I can see.
[27:38.61]Look at that toy train that guy's got there.
[27:42.34]Let's go.
[27:49.82]That's the best part.
[27:52.84]Alright, here we go.
[27:53.36]I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I fucked it up.
[27:54.97]People have been waiting for this for a long time.
[27:57.07]I don't see that hype in the chat right now.
[27:58.71]Goodbye.
[27:59.41]You know, I want you all to spell it out in one gigantic letter.
[28:03.63]You know, you all have to work on H. And then P. And then E.
[28:13.50]The one ResidentSleeper.
[28:22.14]You stand out so much.
[28:23.68]If you're a ResidentSleeper right now, you are... I can see... Look at that toy train that guy's got there.
[28:30.68]Let's go.
[28:34.85]There's even 3D animations.
[28:37.63]Oh, god damn it.
[28:38.15]It's not that... Turn it up.
[28:43.27]Why is it so long?
[28:52.01]I can't bump it.
[29:02.35]We'll fix it.
[29:07.91]This reminds me of when... Remember when they did that episode where Homer went into the 3D world?
[29:17.37]And it was incredibly off-putting.
[29:20.85]Alright, so let's move around, talk to Marge.
[29:24.99]Let's jump.
[29:26.61]Let's move.
[29:29.95]I have to defend myself.
[29:31.15]You guys, Goldilocks the fuck out of me in the beginning of every stream.
[29:34.19]The whole, like, it's too low, it's too high!
[29:35.79]It actually doesn't look that bad.
[29:36.80]Alright, I'm out of here.
[29:39.14]How's that?
[29:39.56]The audio sounds like it's okay right now.
[29:43.60]Where's,, uh, how do I...
[29:50.18]Turn it up a little bit.
[29:52.64]Voice and sound.
[29:59.58]Music a little bit.
[30:00.59]Yeah!
[30:02.85]Is that better?
[30:06.67]That sounds alright.
[30:08.41]Alright, Marge, what do you got?
[30:09.29]Is this fully voice acting?
[30:11.37]Homie, somebody ate every dessert in the house.
[30:14.90]I need you to run to the store and pick up some of that ice cream with the miniature pies in it.
[30:20.78]Homie, you have to go to the store and pick up that ice cream.
[30:25.79]Hire me.
[30:26.55]Hire me.
[30:26.95]Do it.
[30:28.33]Go to the Quickie Mart and purchase some ice cream and cola.
[30:32.98]Uh, Homer, that's not a nice thing to say.
[30:37.70]It's crashing time.
[30:41.68]Drive to the quickie mark.
[30:48.89]This is like a... Can you crash into people?
[30:51.57]No.
[30:53.47]This is like a licensed TV video game.
[30:58.00]You actually can run... That's... I can't believe that.
[31:00.84]I don't believe it.
[31:02.29]I don't believe you can do that.
[31:09.51]What?
[31:09.83]I thought they were going to jump out of the way.
[31:13.01]I'm very surprised.
[31:15.54]Alright, drive to the quickie mark.
[31:21.68]And I'm getting points for this.
[31:27.41]Alright, okay, I gotta buy a controller to set up.
[31:32.75]What is this for?
[31:33.37]Oh, wait!
[31:34.21]There's a coin!
[31:36.59]Alright, this is a puzzle.
[31:45.94]You get on the roof?
[31:49.95]There's a sprint, right?
[31:50.97]Oops.
[31:52.39]I might have to change some button configurations here.
[31:56.90]Because right now B is run.
[32:02.20]That B and A don't work together is run and then jump.
[32:06.97]I have it on like the Dark Souls settings there.
[32:08.59]Hold on.
[32:10.85]What does this do?
[32:13.03]Oh, I can kick!
[32:13.69]Alright, this is kind of cool.
[32:18.67]Who made this game?
[32:20.91]We have to go to the bathroom real bad!
[32:28.79]Can I just... vandalize?
[32:39.07]FromSoftware made this game.
[32:40.66]Now imagine if they did.
[32:42.16]Hey, uh, hey.
[32:42.88]Uh...
[32:58.40]Okay, hey, I need to get myself some ice cream and some extra cola.
[33:04.50]Hire me!
[33:05.14]I'm available!
[33:05.82]Wait, what's this?
[33:06.94]New shirt.
[33:07.26]Oh, wait, no.
[33:07.66]That's definitely the best one.
[33:32.85]So this is what you do with coins, huh?
[33:37.73]Okay.
[33:38.95]How do I talk to Milhouse?
[33:42.42]Hey, Milhouse.
[33:43.46]Uh, uh, don't!
[33:44.60]You have some problems, Milhouse?
[33:46.36]Hey, here.
[33:47.10]I'll help you.
[33:47.82]I'll help you.
[34:00.75]Why is he Canadian?
[34:12.86]Alright, let's go back.
[34:15.46]Come on, I love how it tells you, okay, I got a... I have a handbrake.
[34:22.08]Get out of my way, jerkass!
[34:23.70]Why am I playing the shittiest games?
[34:27.74]Hold on.
[34:29.55]I'm gonna give you a quick story.
[34:32.53]This is one of the most requested games on this whole channel.
[34:38.93]I think people have been telling me to play this game, through messages and in chat, for two years.
[34:46.73]So I... Come on!
[34:57.57]One guy said that.
[34:58.39]Well, I have to comment on it.
[35:01.73]Alright, hold on.
[35:04.79]Can you dive out of the car?
[35:07.77]No, you can't.
[35:08.33]Alright, you can't kill Mark.
[35:25.86]Alright, I got what you needed.
[35:26.86]Uh, race Principal Skinner to the school and give Lisa her science project.
[35:29.52]Why do I have to race the principal?
[35:31.30]Collect Lisa's science project.
[35:52.24]It's... Alright.
[35:53.58]Drive to the school.
[35:55.28]Where's Principal Skinner?
[36:00.24]Apparently I just have to get there for... Wait, what's that Krusty the Crab thing?
[36:02.80]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[36:04.02]Stay on the road.
[36:07.92]Oh, there they are.
[36:10.93]Okay, that person just tried to kill me.
[36:12.47]That person tried to kill me.
[36:19.83]Two out of two.
[36:27.76]How do you like it?
[36:28.86]Can I run him off the road?
[36:30.96]He used a cheat code!
[36:32.56]Two, four, six, eight!
[36:33.86]You suck!
[36:34.62]I'm great!
[36:35.16]La, da, da, da!
[36:36.52]You are the one I hate!
[36:38.98]Park did it.
[36:42.23]Are we gonna get that all game?
[36:44.07]I blame society.
[36:45.65]I think we're gonna get that all game, aren't we?
[36:49.21]Whoa!
[36:49.75]End of the school!
[36:51.61]Wait, through what door?
[36:53.99]Nothing lasts forever.
[36:59.36]I beat him, right?
[37:05.85]The front door.
[37:06.65]I'm inside.
[37:09.47]Oh, there you are.
[37:10.09]Thanks for bringing me my model of the digestive system.
[37:13.89]Thanks for bringing me the model of the digestive system.
[37:16.73]Where's the gallbladder?
[37:17.83]I'm available.
[37:20.61]By the way, Dad, Mom called.
[37:24.33]She says she needs to talk to you at home before you go to work.
[37:28.49]What's this?
[37:28.85]Oh, it's the principal's office.
[37:34.98]What?
[37:35.14]That's not good.
[37:36.80]I want that one, so that's 125 points.
[37:59.40]Why would you install- install asbestos in a school?
[38:10.99]Oh.
[38:15.41]I didn't know that's a- I thought I was moving the- I thought I was moving the fucking- I thought I was moving the bookcase.
[38:22.87]I didn't know I was pulling the fire alarm.
[38:29.81]Alright, let's go.
[38:34.95]Press all the actions.
[38:41.39]Are there more than one?
[38:42.16]No, that's it.
[38:47.02]I got his.
[38:47.48]Oh, wait, no, no.
[38:51.62]It's like a point-and-click adventure game.
[38:55.50]You can press every button.
[38:59.75]Remain calm, students.
[39:05.01]All is well at the school.
[39:06.77]My authority as principal... There's a lot of lore.
[39:10.27]That's cool.
[39:15.13]What's all the dice for?
[39:18.03]Who are you?
[39:18.85]Race 4, wager race.
[39:20.31]Entry fee 20, time to beat 315.
[39:21.49]Best time, difficulty medium.
[39:23.51]Complete an entire lap before time runs out.
[39:34.01]An entire lap Can I get 60 bucks for doing this?
[39:41.54]I guess I have to do it before I can talk about how I did it This is a medium Just don't run into anything just do it gently and get it correct
[39:59.23]No!
[39:59.83]I'm fine.
[40:12.10]I'm thinking... I got it!
[40:14.70]What the fuck was that?
[40:18.54]Wait, what?
[40:20.44]Oh, that's not it.
[40:21.27]I thought that was a complete lap for a second.
[40:23.49]Okay.
[40:24.97]Well, I thought that was it.
[40:26.45]I thought that was like the end.
[40:30.08]What was that big circle?
[40:31.30]I don't think I'm gonna get it now.
[40:43.96]This car's gonna explode.
[40:57.41]I still might get it.
[41:04.73]He's gonna rage a lot this stream.
[41:07.04]Why?
[41:07.32]It's The Simpsons!
[41:08.96]How can you get mad at Homer Simpson?
[41:20.43]Am I gonna eat my own words in like 45 minutes?
[41:31.86]Alright, this is a little road.
[41:36.42]If I bump into anybody else, I'm gonna explode.
[41:40.86]Use the shortcuts!
[41:48.58]I think I want to just try to win the first race ever.
[42:00.70]Is that it?
[42:02.08]Oh my god, son of a... I'm almost there.
[42:09.65]I'm really close.
[42:20.75]Come on!
[42:21.27]It's right there!
[42:21.91]I did it.
[42:25.21]No, I didn't.
[42:25.83]What the fuck?
[42:27.21]What?! !
[42:32.03]I'm not going to get it.
[42:34.94]I'm not going to get it.
[42:35.96]I'm not going to get it.
[42:37.36]I'm not going to get it.
[42:38.14]I got it.
[42:40.56]No, I didn't.
[42:41.18]No, I didn't.
[42:41.70]Where's the end?
[42:42.10]Oh!
[43:09.18]I can do that.
[43:11.04]I can do that.
[43:13.55]I know I can do that.
[43:15.69]Because I didn't know that the blue circle wasn't the end of the race.
[43:18.95]So I turned around and ran into the wall.
[43:24.01]You didn't use any of the shortcuts.
[43:25.47]Well... No, this car is all fucked up.
[43:31.44]I can't do it yet.
[43:38.00]What is this?
[43:38.44]Is it pay-in spray?
[43:44.40]I need to, like, drive my car into the garage.
[43:54.47]Kick the kids into the road!
[43:59.73]Easy, psycho!
[44:07.96]Holy shit!
[44:21.01]Ooh.
[44:24.71]How much is this?
[44:25.27]Can I, like, repair this?
[44:31.48]Can you come and get me?
[44:32.96]I'll pay you in back rubs.
[44:37.33]Who did I just call to come get me?
[44:41.73]Who just came to get me?
[44:50.16]I just called me.
[44:55.14]Well, somebody said that you can go to the phone.
[45:01.35]I mean, I see a giant wrench, so let me pick that up.
[45:05.58]That's, okay, you pick up the giant wrenches.
[45:07.64]Ooh, the vibration's tickling my feet.
[45:12.90]I wish I had a dog with a saddle.
[45:14.81]Alright, what do you got, Marge?
[45:22.71]Homer, go talk to Ned Flanders.
[45:24.69]He seems miffed and PO'd.
[45:27.26]Why me?
[45:28.06]I'm the world's greatest neighbor.
[45:29.76]I even have a mug to that effect.
[45:34.68]The phone is for when the car is completely destroyed.
[45:38.34]Alright, so go to Flandre's house and talk to Ned, but first I'm going to take some pizza coins.
[45:50.93]What else is back here?
[45:51.71]There's a lot of shit back here.
[45:54.78]What is this?
[45:55.18]A buzz card.
[45:57.60]Hmm.
[46:00.62]Hmm.
[46:04.11]Uh, okay, I just turned on the grill?
[46:09.93]What is this shit in my backyard?
[46:11.59]I can go on the swing.
[46:17.83]No?
[46:18.67]I guess you can't go on the swing.
[46:20.55]Interesting.
[46:21.03]Okay.
[46:27.73]So, I wanna get up here.
[46:28.83]Probably have to go on the roof somehow.
[46:37.78]There's probably a drop down from the roof.
[46:41.22]There's a, okay, there's a double jump.
[46:42.90]I did not know that we, I, why would I know, why would I think there was a double jump?
[46:48.84]There's a double jump.
[46:54.52]Oh, almost.
[47:00.72]I can sell this on the internet.
[47:02.64]You mean I gotta get more?
[47:13.75]Alright, let's go to Flanders.
[47:14.73]Please don't sue!
[47:27.90]Hey, Flanders.
[47:28.95]I'm all in a dither, Homer.
[47:30.19]So many of my possessions have disappeared.
[47:32.87]I called the police to find the culprit.
[47:34.67]Culprit, eh?
[47:35.87]My lawnmower, my cooler, my lawn chair, a family portrait, even Rod's inhaler.
[47:41.10]What kind of sick individual would take this stuff?
[47:43.52]Oh, no.
[47:44.20]I borrowed all of Flanders' stuff.
[47:45.88]Quick, think of an excuse to get out of here.
[47:47.98]Uh, excuse me.
[47:49.24]I think I have to go shuck some corn.
[47:55.99]Alright, collect all six of Ned's lost items before the time runs out.
[48:01.14]Get into your vehicle.
[48:03.56]So I have to go find all of Ned Flanders' stuff.
[48:06.52]Find his tuxedo.
[48:10.94]Do I have to get out of the car?
[48:13.18]No, I don't.
[48:14.00]Okay.
[48:14.78]Find the lawnmower.
[48:20.46]Uh, I can't, I can't talk to you right now.
[48:22.81]Whoever the fuck is calling me.
[48:25.51]I'm trying to pick up Flanders fucking toys.
[48:32.06]Damn it!
[48:32.88]Fucking cell phone!
[48:36.00]Give it to me!
[48:38.93]No, give me the...
[48:45.77]I need the lawn chair.
[48:47.17]Oh god, why?
[48:47.65]Get out of the way.
[48:48.41]I just killed him.
[48:49.65]There's a bunch of shit.
[48:50.85]Oh wait, I don't care about anything else.
[48:53.83]Just give me the coins.
[49:17.12]Holy shit, that's more money than I've ever seen.
[49:22.60]I got plenty of time.
[49:23.28]I can finally... I can buy the huge, fat Homer outfit.
[49:28.60]I can't wait.
[49:41.77]Alright, that was pretty cool.
[49:43.62]What a classic game, huh?
[49:44.40]Got it.
[49:44.70]Wait, before the cops?
[50:11.04]Is there a wanted level in this game?
[50:12.97]No, there's not.
[50:17.99]Is there?
[50:18.59]There is.
[50:22.37]How the hell does that work?
[50:32.40]Homer is a criminal.
[50:35.94]Well, howdy-dly-ho, Homer!
[50:37.44]See?
[50:41.10]I'm kidding.
[50:41.68]Let's not be doing it for real.
[50:42.68]Cool.
[50:42.78]Alright, hold on.
[50:43.14]I wanted to see if I could... Let me just look at stuff.
[50:44.99]There's money everywhere.
[51:08.99]Let me just examine people's backyards.
[51:13.31]What's in Flanders' backyard?
[51:15.39]Tire swing.
[51:19.19]That's kind of cool.
[51:21.47]Do you get, like, a bunker back here?
[51:24.49]What the hell is this?
[51:28.20]What the hell was that?
[51:30.54]Was that us on camera?
[51:40.93]That was weird.
[51:41.79]Alright.
[51:43.37]I'm just gonna bank all my money.
[51:52.12]What?
[51:57.38]These are all... I'm gonna be honest with you guys.
[52:06.90]Now, don't take me as a bad person or an idiot or something, but... I think there's only like six episodes of The Simpsons that I've ever really actually watched from start to finish.
[52:21.48]I don't get any of this shit.
[52:28.32]I saw the original Treehouse of Horror.
[52:31.44]And then the episode where Maggie's a murderer.
[52:37.37]I don't even know what their last name is.
[52:38.69]There's a lot of references.
[52:55.26]Wait, what do you mean?
[52:58.66]That's a spoiler?
[52:59.60]I thought that was like the thing that they all talk about every episode.
[53:18.08]Wait, the show's like 25 years old!
[53:19.02]The Simpsons is not like a movie that came out last weekend.
[53:50.23]Oh my god, did you just really spoil an episode?
[53:53.86]From 1996?
[53:54.28]I want to look around.
[54:05.69]Yeah, and guess what guys?
[54:07.15]Ross doesn't date Phoebe.
[54:09.57]That happened in like 94.
[54:32.81]That's not even a Simpsons.
[54:34.00]Wait.
[54:34.18]That's not The Simpsons.
[54:41.18]I got to talk to Lennie.
[54:50.56]Ross isn't... What if somebody was watching Friends for the first time?
[54:53.80]I mean, Friends has been... I don't know.
[54:58.60]I'm making that up.
[54:59.52]I made everything up.
[55:01.18]Hey, Homer.
[55:01.72]How about a breakfast churro?
[55:02.94]No time.
[55:03.85]Tell me where to find Mr. Smithers.
[55:05.73]I think I saw him at the Quickie Mart.
[55:08.23]More breakfast churros for Lenny.
[55:10.27]I'm going to need a car with a little more junk in the trunk if I'm going to take him out.
[55:14.31]I wonder if Barney still has the Plow King.
[55:23.78]150 coins!
[55:23.96]You're killing me here.
[55:25.56]Barney, can I borrow the Plow King?
[55:26.47]Take what you want, sexy leprechaun!
[55:28.23]Just don't shoot me with that dart gun!
[55:30.77]Whatever.
[55:50.48]Holy shit.
[55:51.58]Alright, that was... F1 is show stats, but I don't have that on the controller, so let's do it.
[55:57.31]Toughness.
[55:57.85]Handling.
[55:58.41]Yeah.
[55:59.83]Purchase it.
[56:01.87]There goes 150 coins.
[56:05.19]Destroy Smithers' car before it gets to the power plant.
[56:11.49]Get into your car.
[56:15.24]Is there a way I can turn the camera?
[56:21.31]I feel like I can't.
[56:21.99]Is it the mouse?
[56:23.25]Alright, we got all these timed missions.
[56:29.53]God damn it.
[56:33.70]This thing handles like shit.
[56:40.04]This is hard to control.
[56:41.96]I want the pink family donut car.
[56:47.73]It was like that when I got here.
[56:49.29]This is a really bad day.
[56:51.53]Mistakes were made.
[56:54.21]Alright, we're going to do the shortcut.
[56:55.95]Oh, I wanted a peanut.
[56:58.01]Oh, that was not a shortcut.
[57:01.93]Or maybe it was.
[57:02.88]Good driving is adequate, but lacks passion.
[57:07.96]Alright, destroy Smithers.
[57:09.20]Well, you rotten karmic retribution.
[57:13.12]Learn to drive, you dumbass.
[57:17.20]Kind of have to get some speed here.
[57:20.58]Look at that right there.
[57:24.44]I want to go over that.
[57:25.10]I think I just have to ram him.
[57:38.86]Yeah.
[57:41.97]Ran to the wall.
[57:44.11]Oh, that was a lot of damage.
[57:46.25]That was a lot of damage.
[57:48.65]Perfect, he's dead.
[57:52.79]Yeah, spoiler alert, guys, sorry.
[57:54.46]This is where, like, you kill Smith's best friend Smothers, whatever his name is.
[57:58.80]I'm not afraid to die.
[58:03.52]Nothing lasts forever.
[58:06.59]Why is he still... Uh, why is he not exploding?
[58:14.21]See?
[58:14.49]Spoiler.
[58:15.71]Streamer smothers smothers.
[58:33.41]Do I have a horn?
[58:34.03]Yeah.
[58:34.19]Spoilers.
[58:34.45]Hey, who's that?
[58:36.01]Why does that guy have a money symbol?
[58:39.09]Duff truck.
[58:41.43]Oh, you just sell trucks.
[59:04.73]No, I don't need anything from you right now.
[59:06.03]A lot of random people.
[59:16.24]Jeremiah, I have not watched this part of the game yet.
[59:18.32]Please stop.
[59:19.00]By the way, Santa... Oh, never mind.
[59:20.44]Hmm.
[59:34.89]This is a blind run, yes.
[59:35.73]Heh.
[60:01.84]Find cardboard tubes and collect the Tamako harvest for Cletus in under 2.30.
[60:08.68]Oh, get into your vehicle.
[60:10.61]This is not the kind of car I think I need for this.
[60:14.35]That's the kind of car that I need for this.
[60:16.05]That one right there.
[60:16.97]Can you drop it off?
[60:18.33]Actually, that'd be alright.
[60:30.69]I snuck through there, I'm good.
[60:33.60]Not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad.
[60:44.22]Ooh.
[60:46.18]Alright, not bad.
[60:54.70]Where are you trying to get me to rip around?
[60:56.93]That guy's got low gravity on.
[60:59.59]That guy's flying around through space.
[61:01.51]I had nothing to do with that.
[61:07.93]Through here.
[61:11.26]This thing is so slow.
[61:13.16]Can I break through this?
[61:14.38]Oh my god.
[61:22.45]That's not a shortcut, okay?
[61:24.63]I can't just, like, break through the doors.
[61:34.72]I see this.
[61:35.89]You get points for this.
[61:45.33]One minute to... That was a school bus.
[61:48.75]Oops.
[61:50.49]Uh, I don't... Is this shortcut?
[61:53.97]Why is that on fire?
[61:57.36]Shortcut!
[62:17.71]Collect the- Oh, I have 25 seconds to get this shit!
[62:23.07]Should I get out of the car?
[62:26.15]I'm getting out!
[62:27.15]OOOH!
[62:46.38]No, that's not it?
[62:47.20]What?
[62:48.16]Oh my god.
[63:03.23]Holy shit.
[63:04.42]I need another car.
[63:06.74]Yeah, I can't do it with this fucking thing.
[63:09.18]How do I just cancel this?
[63:14.81]You can just steal cars?
[63:18.24]You can actually just steal a car.
[63:23.12]What?
[63:24.66]I... I didn't think this was possible either.
[63:28.50]Wait, what?
[63:33.69]You can steal cars!
[63:40.29]It's actually just GTA.
[63:46.76]Alright, well, how do I... How do I restart this?
[63:57.18]Homer really is a fucking criminal.
[64:00.66]Well, now I got the school... Oh, I blocked off the road.
[64:03.20]Hold on.
[64:03.60]I'm in... This is worse.
[64:05.88]That I'm in the school bus.
[64:07.38]Actually, the school bus is probably a little bit faster.
[64:12.16]I made it on my own roadblock.
[64:17.76]I think I can still get it.
[64:18.54]I think I'll be alright.
[64:26.34]Don't get out of the car.
[64:28.32]As long as I get back there within two minutes.
[64:31.02]That's what happens when you look at the chat for no reason.
[64:34.28]Alright, give me a better car.
[64:39.33]I'm gonna restart it with a better car.
[64:49.16]Come here.
[64:50.25]Telephone.
[64:55.07]Uh, damage.
[64:56.03]4%.
[64:56.31]Give me.
[64:56.81]Thank you.
[64:57.29]Alright.
[64:57.53]This is my real car.
[65:02.59]Alright.
[65:03.69]Let's go.
[65:10.80]Homer Simpson did his own mocap for this game.
[65:16.20]Really?
[65:17.30]That's interesting.
[65:23.87]That is pretty interesting.
[65:31.47]Alright, nice and easy.
[65:36.21]Oh, come on.
[65:36.97]What the hell?
[65:37.49]I had to go over that lip?
[65:50.55]Back there I'll get it As long as I get back there with about a minute left
[66:15.91]I love how I looked over at chat, and the first thing I see is, stop looking at chat.
[66:19.65]This is the right way, I remember I went through this.
[66:24.17]Alright, now I gotta get this right.
[66:29.47]Don't read this!
[66:35.43]Oh my god!
[66:38.69]I can't help myself!
[66:40.97]I didn't even get the bonus!
[66:48.19]What does this mean?
[67:00.54]Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[67:03.74]Here are the cops.
[67:04.90]That show-off.
[67:13.66]Too much heat, apparently.
[67:20.44]27 seconds.
[67:21.02]I'll make it.
[67:21.56]I'm almost there.
[67:22.18]Alright, I brought it back.
[67:30.65]Hello, Cletus.
[67:35.24]Okay, city boy, I'll help you.
[67:37.28]You just yell into one of those magic talk boxes, and I'll come a-running.
[67:42.59]Oh, man, them things is crazy.
[67:45.11]Phone is mission complete.
[67:48.81]Congratulations, you've unlocked Cletus' pickup truck.
[67:50.95]Go to a phone booth to use it.
[67:53.13]Oh, nice.
[68:04.96]Does Bart Simpson drive in this game?
[68:07.70]No, they wouldn't do that, right?
[68:14.39]Bart Simpson drives in this game.
[68:16.11]Okay, let's try that.
[68:25.84]Let's try the new car.
[68:26.72]Pickup truck.
[68:35.94]Toughness, handling, speed, acceleration.
[68:40.80]This thing sucks.
[68:44.41]This is just a shitty plow king.
[68:45.83]Wait.
[68:48.49]He's gonna... I'm not driving.
[68:49.29]Wait.
[68:50.09]I'm him now.
[69:14.07]That's kind of cool.
[69:16.11]Spines don't bend that way.
[69:21.05]Look at that 180 degree neck turn.
[69:29.01]Just put some butter on the wound.
[69:31.03]It'll be fine.
[69:32.52]Yeah, I'm just hitchhiking right now.
[69:34.28]That's really cool.
[69:34.96]Alright, let me get this this time.
[69:44.65]Got it.
[69:46.05]Power, I still have to turn on this power plant mission.
[69:55.01]Wait, that was supposed to be a race?
[69:58.99]Am I, are cars allowed in here?
[70:05.56]What the fuck?
[70:07.76]Holy shit.
[70:08.68]Okay, this is freaking me out.
[70:10.14]Hold on.
[70:11.52]You got real pretty acceleration.
[70:26.66]I need to get out of this car.
[70:28.38]Alright, Homer's workstation.
[70:35.69]Thanks for the ride.
[70:42.47]Almost got... yeah.
[70:47.78]Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[70:48.64]What's this button do?
[70:50.96]Sneak right... Well, now you got me all fucked up because this is... This probably sounds like a secret chest up here or something.
[71:10.95]Yeah, it ain't gonna fuck me up.
[71:20.95]All that for, what, one coin?
[71:23.43]Oops.
[71:32.13]Hey, I gotta change that button.
[71:33.31]Jump can't be B. Uh, I mean run can't be B.
[71:40.73]Because I have to, like, turn my hand around and do B and A to jump.
[71:43.75]I gotta change that to... What the hell?
[71:45.91]X, maybe?
[71:46.93]B, attack?
[71:48.07]Yeah, that makes more sense.
[71:48.93]Yeah, attack would be... Should be B. Jump should be A. Sprint should be X. Get in is Y. Okay, that's better.
[72:05.71]Plug in a controller.
[72:06.41]That's what I'm playing with.
[72:08.13]I'm playing with a controller right now.
[72:11.55]Yeah, that feels better.
[72:12.97]That feels more correct.
[72:17.31]Man, I keep forgetting about the double jump.
[72:19.17]It's alright.
[72:19.61]Alright, here we go.
[72:21.81]Wait, I want to look around Homer's station.
[72:23.37]Am I breathing in these fumes and going crazy?
[72:28.13]I don't get it.
[72:42.33]Destroy all the power couplings before time runs out.
[72:45.05]What?
[72:48.58]What is this?
[72:49.80]Hold on.
[72:50.56]I... I just killed somebody.
[73:06.03]Destroy all the...
[73:10.91]No, this is gonna suck absolute ass.
[73:12.65]This is gonna be real bad, but no, I'll get it.
[73:14.17]Ha ha!
[73:16.33]Stupid like a fucks!
[73:35.05]What does stupid like a fox mean?
[73:37.67]You hear how low that was?
[73:39.41]Stupid like a fox.
[73:43.67]No, I got it.
[73:45.23]I'm good.
[73:47.44]I got stuck on that.
[73:48.46]I got fucking clipped on that.
[73:50.62]Sorry, I got a ton of time.
[74:01.34]It's not like anyone likes these things.
[74:09.35]Alright, I got it.
[74:15.05]Whoa.
[74:16.45]Whoa, where are we going?
[74:17.73]Buzzkill!
[74:20.95]On the blades?
[74:22.15]Or over the railing?
[74:28.66]Uh.
[74:31.64]Just walk on the blade?
[74:34.88]Oh.
[74:43.95]Now I have to get that though.
[74:45.11]That was a little bit... a little bit hard to do.
[74:47.22]I think I'll get it.
[74:47.64]I'll get it... I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[75:08.00]Jump fro- ugh! Jump from the blades.
[75:13.95]Yeah, maybe I can make it like this. Ah!
[75:28.19]Try it one more time.
[75:36.66]Ahem.
[75:42.36]Just go.
[75:42.96]I want to just get the thing.
[75:45.46]Alright, when you were playing Simpsons Hit and Run, and you saw like a little secret here, and it was kind of tricky to jump to get it, did you give up after two times?
[76:02.27]See?
[76:02.77]Like, why would I do that?
[76:04.77]I got it.
[76:17.69]Finally, I can get some sleep.
[76:20.73]Mindless drones, return to your ugly families.
[76:24.01]I'm king of the world!
[76:28.34]Got it.
[76:30.62]Drive to The Simpsons house.
[76:31.90]Wait, is there anything?
[76:32.44]Can I look at stuff in the office?
[76:39.80]Is it a bug farm?
[76:45.38]I can't interact with anything else in Homer's office.
[76:48.74]There's no fall damage.
[76:49.84]No, none in hit and run.
[76:51.52]Oh, now I'm in trouble.
[76:55.92]Okay, I see.
[77:14.34]Can I drive up this?
[77:16.94]Uh, I can't drive up this.
[77:20.89]Had to get some momentum.
[77:24.35]263?
[77:27.25]That's not bad.
[77:28.37]Alright, back to the house.
[77:29.23]Oh, I swallowed my gum.
[77:40.18]Our safety record.
[77:40.72]Seven days since the last accident.
[77:41.97]Actually, none.
[77:44.09]Considering that I just melted somebody in there.
[77:55.14]Watch that meter.
[77:55.90]Yeah, I do need to keep my eye on the meter.
[78:01.60]You're right.
[78:03.68]That's the you're in trouble meter.
[78:15.00]I want it.
[78:15.32]Give it to me.
[78:20.45]There is a card back here.
[78:21.55]So what do these do?
[78:35.85]Mr. Sparklebox.
[78:39.58]There's also something to do here.
[78:40.46]Yeah, there's a lot of random shit to do.
[78:47.18]Get them all.
[78:48.68]Get all the cards.
[78:53.52]I don't think I'm going to do that.
[78:59.19]It's a pointless collectible?
[79:01.37]Didn't he say he could sell them?
[79:10.29]I want to get rid of this car.
[79:15.51]Give me a phone.
[79:17.35]I want my other car back.
[79:18.29]If I'm going to do a race, I need to have my other car.
[79:20.41]Alright, give that to me.
[79:31.39]Kill Milhouse.
[79:32.69]You can't kill anybody in this game.
[79:35.21]Why would I do that?
[79:35.87]Save me, Weekend Dad!
[79:44.71]Alright, let's do it.
[79:45.23]Reach the finish line before time runs out.
[79:46.29]Don't destroy your vehicle.
[79:47.38]Five laps.
[79:47.80]Oh, they'd really like to throw these at you.
[79:49.08]This is a drift map.
[80:12.35]Am I actually gonna be able to do five laps here?
[80:23.34]Maybe, but I don't know.
[80:24.64]That's gonna be close.
[80:26.17]There can't be any mistakes.
[80:39.76]NOOOO!
[80:41.18]UGH!
[80:41.34]I'm actually... I'm so mad right now.
[80:44.06]I'm actually fucking angry.
[80:45.50]Oh, slow down.
[80:46.36]Easy, Jeremy.
[80:46.96]What the fuck was that?
[80:47.90]I went from like a zero to a fucking thousand.
[80:59.25]I can just break the damn tree.
[81:04.03]It was going so well, too.
[81:05.11]I still get it.
[81:12.73]The scales just tipped.
[81:13.81]Somebody put like four weights on the other side.
[81:15.73]I almost didn't hit it.
[81:21.33]So what do I get for that?
[81:23.33]Nothing?
[81:41.83]Apparently nothing.
[81:42.51]Oh, I think I broke something.
[81:46.80]That's what Homer wanted to do all season four, right?
[81:54.50]Lousy, rotten, karmic retribution.
[81:56.75]Let's do this thing!
[81:58.83]Spoiler.
[81:59.41]Oh, please.
[82:01.43]Don't even.
[82:02.95]That's not a spoiler.
[82:04.29]Real Jerma checking in.
[82:05.41]This is a spoiler.
[82:06.09]What happened?
[82:06.89]Is the stream still live?
[82:07.99]I mean, there is, but not in this context.
[82:11.64]Wait, across to the crab.
[82:12.60]Like, nice.
[82:17.25]I saw people saying that, like, the stream was dead.
[82:19.07]Like, all three races were gone.
[82:20.91]What happened?
[82:22.59]Well, when they pop up, I'll do it.
[82:23.63]I sprinted up here.
[82:24.33]I got a notification on my phone when I drop a thousand viewers.
[82:27.31]I know something's wrong.
[82:28.09]I've run up here when I drop a thousand viewers.
[82:29.57]That means I gotta fucking get up here and do something.
[82:35.82]Homer wasn't introduced until season six.
[82:39.86]That's so funny.
[82:41.04]Homer wasn't introduced until season 6?
[82:46.11]Who the fuck said that?
[82:47.33]Alright, I'll see you later.
[82:48.69]It's just a bug.
[82:49.35]Alright, bye.
[82:52.47]over the discovery of surveillance cameras throughout the town.
[82:55.89]We go now to City Hall, where Mayor Quimby is fielding questions from an angry mob.
[83:00.61]These miniature cameras are an outrage.
[83:03.29]Spying on our women's dressing rooms, bathrooms, and locker rooms is unforgivable.
[83:08.69]I think I speak for all Springfielders when I say, where is the sexy footage?
[83:14.45]In other unexplained news, strange black vans have been appearing all over town.
[83:21.14]What?
[83:21.56]Uh, investigate and follow the black van.
[83:27.64]Don't let it get away.
[83:31.09]That was comedy, apparently.
[83:34.03]Follow the black van.
[83:34.81]Let's go!
[83:54.81]I'm assuming that's the meter at the top is don't fill that otherwise mission failed Fucking escort mission they put these in this goddamn game Fill it why would I fill it?
[84:26.78]Isn't that the meter that is... Hey, don't get that close.
[84:30.34]You're too close, Homer.
[84:34.34]I know what that meter is.
[84:35.28]I've played a GTA game before. ...
[84:55.48]Alright, school bus, what are you doing?
[85:04.81]No, I'm not gonna get baited from chat for the 4000th time.
[85:09.97]To fill the meter, get up real close, and have it be like, DON'T!
[85:39.04]Nuclear power plant Heading into the power plant

[88:07.63]I love to sit.
[88:09.27]How does this work?
[88:09.87]Mistakes were made.
[88:13.94]Do I get this forever now?
[88:17.08]Watch it, I almost spilled my sundae.
[88:22.96]This thing's already gonna explode.
[88:27.81]Oh, that just startled me!
[88:37.52]That thing sucks!
[88:41.29]This is really fast.
[88:42.41]Oh, I should have had the rocket car for this, right?
[88:45.73]I know you.
[88:46.59]You're the kid that sells me bootleg CDs on the street corner.
[88:49.71]Yeah, well, I've been having some legal problems lately, so I'm stuck running these races for the DMV.
[88:55.62]It was this or read to the elderly.
[88:57.62]What?
[89:01.66]Hopefully all laps and finish the race in first place don't destroy the vehicle.
[89:07.21]Oh no, I do have the car.
[89:09.49]How do I do this without blowing up the car?
[89:11.75]This is not gonna happen.
[89:20.41]Alright, here's my plan.
[89:22.27]My plan is to be very careful and then go punch it as hard as I can on the last lap.
[89:30.12]I'm just gonna hold down right trigger.
[89:32.29]Holy shit, they're so, they're so dumb.
[89:36.79]Okay, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[89:40.29]I'm gonna punch it.
[89:41.39]He doesn't matter.
[89:42.08]He can toad the fuck out of me if he wants.
[89:51.68]Wait, hold on.
[89:52.93]No, I don't, I can't do that.
[90:13.50]This is not gonna work.
[90:14.92]It's not gonna work with this thing.
[90:26.62]I need another car.
[90:31.30]There's no way I can do it in that.
[90:33.30]No, no, don't retry the mission.
[90:35.37]Give me a new car.
[90:42.44]I'll do it again.
[90:44.94]There he is.
[90:45.34]It's Krusty.
[90:54.52]Oh, that was brutal.
[90:56.04]That was brutal.

[93:01.24]He did crash into the wall.
[93:04.40]He's gonna say that a thousand more times.
[93:06.98]He's gonna say that so many more times.
[93:31.86]This is it.
[93:36.15]Last wraparound.
[93:38.89]Ooh, smooth.
[93:41.73]Very smooth.

[93:54.90]Did it not know what place I was just in?
[93:56.40]This is terrible.
[93:57.82]I'm gonna drown my sorrows at the golden banana.
[94:11.10]How did you guys know that?
[94:12.60]You guys have played this game before?
[94:16.88]I'm surprised at how many people have actually played this game.
[94:21.00]That's very surprising to me.
[94:25.79]It's from the TV show?
[94:26.67]Yeah, but how did you know it was gonna be right there?
[94:34.35]I just want to look around.
[94:40.51]Okay, I gotta take a car up here.
[94:44.26]Because I'm gonna blast through that.
[94:45.60]Alright, give me my car.
[94:48.36]How do I get up there?
[94:49.18]How do I get up here?
[94:51.24]Okay, I gotta go around there.
[94:56.45]Why is everybody part of the power plant?
[95:02.58]They just walk around?
[95:09.40]Should I be in one of those suits?
[95:14.91]Oh, this guy's driving the car.
[95:17.85]I didn't steal the car.
[95:25.51]Why?
[95:26.55]Okay, hold on.
[95:27.05]I'll get it.
[95:43.01]God damn it.
[95:50.61]I gotta go back further.

[96:21.14]I need to get the, uh, the help.
[96:22.74]I wish I had a dog with a saddle.
[96:25.86]My knee!
[96:27.30]Did that guy just... Did I... Did that guy dead?
[96:39.16]Well, it's about time.
[96:43.65]I might be able to get out of this.
[96:46.53]I gotta go off the right way, though.
[96:55.10]No!
[96:55.48]Why did I... I'm a lean, mean, speed thingy!
[97:11.89]I am evil homer I am evil homer I died I died I did it didn't I do it that was offshoot I need the rocket car but it's an invisible wall there's nothing up there oh watch it well let's do a mission
[97:43.40]That was a jump.
[97:46.52]How would you break that one?
[97:47.69]Other side?
[97:50.71]Alright, talk to Marge.
[97:55.48]But first, hold on, wait.
[98:00.33]I love that sound.
[98:01.73]That coin collection sound is perfect.
[98:03.03]Uh-oh.
[98:03.23]Hit the delivery truck and collect the bone storm games before time runs out.
[98:07.79]Oh, it's Marge.
[98:31.23]Hit the delivery truck and collect 10 copies.
[98:33.41]Well, that's the truck.
[98:35.63]So you can... Marge, you sure do care about children.
[98:47.28]You're running over a lot of them.
[98:50.40]You really just have to sit right here and bump it a couple times.
[99:00.94]That hitbox is not that big, apparently.
[99:11.47]Wait for it to spawn.
[99:13.01]Easy.
[99:17.89]It's not that hard.
[99:21.05]You just have to be patient.
[99:24.58]Just tap it.
[99:27.68]Break.
[99:29.89]That wasn't enough.
[99:33.27]I'm not sure how.
[99:41.51]Last one.
[99:42.05]Do I have to do something else?
[99:43.19]There's always like a part two in this game, it seems like.
[99:45.52]No.
[99:46.40]Sell the copies to G2A.
[99:50.16]No, that's topical.
[99:59.72]What happened?
[100:01.12]Oh.
[100:01.22]This is what happened to my Amazon package.
[100:04.82]Drive to the power plant.
[100:06.54]Not yet.
[100:07.20]Where's the other race?
[100:29.98]Give me the phone.
[100:32.68]I want to explore around.
[100:33.72]I don't want to just blow through.
[100:34.78]Blow through the game?
[100:42.24]No!
[100:42.86]Why would I do that?
[100:52.52]I don't want to blow through the game.
[100:55.52]Alright.
[100:59.79]What's this?
[101:00.19]I want to go in people's backyards and... I want to find the other race.
[101:09.08]Because there's another car I can get, right?
[101:14.64]I did not explore...
[101:17.59]And that's why you gotta take a minute sometimes, because there is a collectible Pokémon card up there.
[101:23.28]How do I get that?
[101:25.20]There's a huge jump.
[101:27.12]Alright, just wait.
[101:28.54]Relax.
[101:40.66]Oh, that didn't really do anything.
[101:48.64]Not gone fast enough?
[101:49.76]Or was it... was that... I missed the sign.
[101:54.78]I gotta go through the sign.
[101:56.12]Aye.
[101:57.35]Okay, hold on.
[101:57.87]I'll get it.
[101:58.19]Let me line it up.
[102:02.67]Where's the sign?
[102:03.23]Alright, it's right... right there.
[102:10.00]Okay.
[102:12.06]I am Excellente!
[102:20.09]It doesn't do anything!
[102:21.54]It doesn't do anything!
[102:27.38]So let me just platform.
[102:33.08]Let me look around for a place to jump.
[102:36.26]There's some stuff over here.
[102:49.29]From here to here?
[102:50.03]Come on, camera, turn around.
[103:08.28]Made it.
[103:08.52]Alright.
[103:09.90]Now what?
[103:12.34]Is that it?
[103:18.27]Ooh, don't fall off.
[103:20.25]That's it.
[103:27.40]So you're on the wrong roof.
[103:32.42]Oh, the clicking bar's over there.
[103:49.01]So now, can I... can I make this jump from... Holy fuck, I didn't even see it!
[103:57.16]Very nice.
[103:57.72]Oh, look at these PogChamps.
[104:15.84]Where am I?
[104:17.12]Oh.
[104:17.85]Well, got it.
[104:23.45]Does this do anything?
[104:31.26]Don't do that.
[104:31.64]Wait!
[104:31.88]There's another gas.
[104:35.16]Bouncy, bouncy!
[104:39.63]I gotta spend some money.
[104:40.49]Oh, I'm going to the donut boy, right?
[104:43.61]Donut guy?
[104:45.11]I'm soaring like a candy wrapper in an updraft!
[104:48.79]Go away!
[104:49.97]I jumped it.
[104:50.45]Unless it's a bribe.
[104:54.71]Wheeee!
[104:57.45]Whoa!
[104:59.69]Oh, shit!
[105:00.31]Bouncy, bouncy!
[105:01.99]Can I get on his head?
[105:03.83]I'm soaring like a candy wrapper in an updraft!
[105:10.42]I don't think I can do anything about this.
[105:13.58]I could just hang out here.
[105:19.60]Itchy and Scratchy over there.
[105:26.21]You won the game.
[105:28.69]Sometimes.
[105:36.99]ADHD stream.
[105:39.13]Well, I wanted to take a look around for a second to get some money and... Actually, you know, I want to buy that costume.
[105:48.16]I have money, I'm buying it.
[106:10.82]What do you have that is high in both fat and alcohol content?
[106:15.26]I'm so glad you came.
[106:16.62]If I don't increase profits- He just broke his machine.
[106:19.60]I'll just ruin it.
[106:28.25]Did I just get arrested?
[106:31.95]Did I just steal a bunch of money from the fucking ATM?
[106:39.66]What is that?
[106:40.30]Wait, hold on.
[106:40.88]I thought I could play it.
[106:44.04]I just skipped the cutscene because I thought I was playing the game.
[107:03.98]Restart the whole... There we go, there we go, there we go, there we go.
[107:06.26]Let's watch it.
[107:15.12]Holy shit.
[107:19.68]Was this game rated?
[107:20.40]Can I take the duff truck?
[107:28.08]No.
[107:28.26]Right, I want that.
[107:38.77]Interesting platforming.
[107:40.37]Coming right up.
[107:45.59]There's another one of these.
[107:46.35]Ooh, from here to there?
[107:47.35]I think I can make it from here over there.
[107:49.17]This thing gives so much money.
[107:57.06]Oops.
[108:01.58]Okay.
[108:02.02]No, you can do that.
[108:02.90]It's fine.
[108:03.18]It doesn't hurt you.
[108:09.51]Alright.
[108:11.99]Let's go.
[108:13.25]Let's move on.
[108:18.73]Holy fuck, Homer is strong.
[108:25.79]This car is fast.
[108:34.08]This is just screaming by.
[108:38.60]Do the final race.
[108:45.96]Where is it?
[108:49.56]I haven't seen it pop up on the minimap.
[108:51.18]I have to go to the church.
[108:57.62]Whoops.
[108:58.62]We're good.
[108:59.16]It's on two wheels.
[109:21.53]I keep going that way.
[109:22.36]I have not driven down this road once.
[109:25.60]Did that one.
[109:26.18]I don't really know where the church is.
[109:33.90]I'll have to stumble upon it after this mission.
[109:36.07]Come on!
[109:44.73]Oh, that's so unfortunate.
[109:56.91]Carl?
[110:02.96]Hi Carl!
[110:04.03]This is the last mission of the game?
[110:05.97]No, it is not.
[110:07.09]Beat Smithers to Mr. Burns' mansion.
[110:35.86]Sorry!
[110:44.67]I like the car, though.
[110:45.49]It's got the perfect handling, perfect safety features.
[110:52.49]Ooh, almost flipped the whole thing.
[110:59.78]He used a cheat code!
[111:04.53]Oh, he cheated too!
[111:05.41]Fuck, I didn't know they do the cheats.
[111:21.56]Move out of the way!
[111:22.84]Just gotta stay in front of him.
[111:26.32]He's gonna get stuck right there.
[111:28.21]Good.
[111:28.49]Perfect.
[111:31.97]There's not enough room on the road for both of us.
[111:33.57]Should I go straight through?
[111:35.41]Straight through?
[111:37.57]Yup.
[111:38.16]He had the same- Oh, I just fucked him up so bad.
[111:44.94]I just ruined everything for you.
[111:49.74]Don't pass me.
[112:04.42]I don't know where to go.
[112:05.50]I don't watch this TV show.
[112:08.05]I don't.
[112:08.93]Oh, I don't watch this show.
[112:10.97]I would have known.
[112:11.67]You stupid asshole.
[112:17.41]Eat my dust, dust eater.
[112:27.31]Homer ain't losing.
[112:29.15]Homer smash.
[112:37.25]Oh, come on!
[112:37.65]I had it too.
[112:42.51]Right at the end, I cut him off.
[113:06.63]This car, just look at this car.
[113:10.00]What a piece of crap this car is.
[113:12.54]What a piece of crap.
[113:13.74]I just didn't make it.
[113:18.52]Well, I am destroying him right now.
[113:20.33]What is he doing?
[113:21.01]Oh, now I have a wedgie.
[113:27.17]And I didn't even go through the... Oh, I just cracked my neck like in 50 places.
[113:30.65]Just trying to cut corners.
[113:33.51]How many school buses are here?
[113:57.23]He just hit that.
[113:57.83]Good.
[114:01.78]I'm itchy.
[114:02.36]My whole body's itchy.
[114:03.30]I... I... I... Oh, my God.
[114:06.88]My whole fucking body is itching.
[114:08.17]That just helped him.
[114:08.85]Unbelievable.
[114:30.97]That same motherfucker right there.
[114:32.57]It was the same guy.
[114:34.51]It was the same guy.
[114:35.79]I still got it.
[114:36.51]I still got it.
[114:38.43]Where am I going?
[114:39.65]Holy shit.
[114:55.50]As soon as I'm done scratching myself, you're history.
[115:00.99]I beat him.
[115:03.17]Did I win?
[115:05.45]I won.
[115:06.79]Team Montgomery Burns, I know you're guilty.
[115:15.72]You're accused.
[115:17.56]Sir?
[115:18.10]Fine, I admit it.
[115:19.05]I had Amelia Earhart's plane shot down.
[115:21.58]That hussy was getting too big for her jodhpurs.
[115:24.10]No!
[115:24.76]You're spying on...
[115:27.50]Final cutscene of the game.
[115:28.82]First try, itty.
[115:29.38]I thought I just failed the mission.
[115:56.09]My heart just sank into my stomach.
[116:03.20]Did I beat it?
[116:27.48]No, I didn't.
[116:30.18]Talk to... Oh, now I get to play as Bart.
[116:41.26]This is a different place.
[116:43.27]This is like 20 years in the future.
[116:44.93]She baited.
[116:52.07]Ooh, what's this?
[116:53.47]I wanna look around.
[116:54.27]Avoid Principal Skinner, drive to the try and save before time runs out.
[116:56.63]I guess I'm going into the rocket car.
[117:21.91]And this is a seven-year-old driving a car.
[117:30.23]Don't let him... Ah, this is... This is a grown man trying to drive into a kid in a go-kart.
[118:01.97]Because I just have to avoid him for a minute.
[118:03.36]And I'm doing a pretty good job avoiding.
[118:07.08]Got it.
[118:08.96]The Bartman!
[118:09.62]Empty the bar.
[118:10.62]What do you mean, empty the bar?
[118:33.15]Wait, free stuff.
[118:34.23]The money carries over to the next land.
[118:35.59]Drive to Herman's.
[119:04.42]I don't wanna get in the thing.
[119:13.04]Home!
[119:14.74]Oh, God.
[119:16.04]Okay, I thought I just did that.
[119:17.50]I thought I just kicked him into it and blew it up.
[119:26.89]Hey!
[119:27.67]What do you got for me?
[119:29.32]It's me, Bart!
[119:29.74]That was a gag.
[119:30.22]A lot of self-referential video game.
[119:32.18]Video games are bad referentials.
[119:33.96]Collect fireworks from around Springfield before time runs out.
[119:55.83]I only have 60 seconds to do this.
[120:02.55]That's not a way to turn.
[120:16.99]These people are jumping.
[120:17.95]They're just jumping into the... I don't know.
[120:20.03]I'm not doing that.
[120:20.87]They are.
[120:21.19]And it's right over two people's heads.
[120:29.26]There's the car wash.
[120:30.22]No, don't tell me to go that way.
[120:32.09]It's right here.
[120:32.67]Oh, hey, Otto.
[120:39.33]One box of your finest quality Chinese frog launchers, please.
[120:42.77]Here you go.
[120:43.47]Two kilos of Chinese sky candy.
[120:45.87]They'll blow you away.
[120:49.67]Alright.
[120:50.33]Got it.
[120:50.99]Enter modes.
[120:51.55]Do I have to... Am I going to prank call them?
[120:59.38]Can I interact?
[121:00.94]With any of this stuff?
[121:06.08]I can't jump.
[121:08.15]Yeah, I'm gonna... Can I call him?
[121:10.13]That's the joke, right?
[121:14.57]Drink at the bar as Bart.
[121:16.69]Sorry, Bart.
[121:17.53]I can't serve booze to a minor.
[121:19.11]It ain't right.
[121:19.67]I'm hearing about fireworks.
[121:20.95]Oh, hell yeah.
[121:27.14]No problemo.
[121:33.77]I won!
[121:34.87]What did I get?
[121:46.98]One coin.
[121:47.72]Do it again.
[121:53.62]That was the coolest thing I've seen anybody do in the game.
[121:55.98]He just did a full backflip.
[121:57.50]No hands.
[122:14.05]Cold fish.
[122:15.60]One more.
[122:18.56]Did it again!
[122:19.04]I'm pretty good at this.
[122:24.08]Why is there a mirror world?
[122:26.82]Yeah, that is strange.
[122:27.58]That's something to do with how the game is being rendered.
[122:30.10]I don't know why it's doing that.
[122:37.71]Let's go.
[122:43.53]Drive to the Springfield Town Hall.
[122:47.68]You got it.
[122:48.18]Mark.
[122:48.48]Wait.
[122:48.78]Not yet.
[122:49.10]What's this?
[123:06.63]It's a reference that I don't get.
[123:11.84]It's a reference.
[123:15.72]That was anticlimactic.
[123:16.62]I should have drove through that.
[123:20.86]Oh my god.
[123:22.68]Fucking timer up there.
[123:23.66]Goddammit.
[123:35.13]Not a joke.
[123:35.79]No, I... No, it wasn't.
[123:37.59]I wasn't even paying any attention to it.
[123:39.07]I just... For some reason, just my brain turned off the fact that the top corner of the screen was a timer.
[123:49.50]And that every single mission is timed.
[123:50.98]I'm gonna do the whole thing again.
[124:04.07]God damn it.
[124:13.32]Boomer memory.
[124:16.03]No, no, no.
[124:17.89]Wait, Moe's is right next to it.
[124:34.75]Fireworks, yeah!
[124:39.91]Talk to him.
[124:42.05]Sorry, bot.
[124:46.21]Alright.
[124:49.45]I think my... You know what it was?
[124:50.77]It was the fact that the timer's not there now.
[124:52.42]The timer's not there.
[124:54.66]You know what I mean?
[124:56.24]The timer is not here.
[124:57.62]I didn't pay attention, and now it is.
[125:00.48]So, that's why.
[125:01.36]Oh, this is too cool for school.
[125:09.61]And I want to look at the city.
[125:26.02]Alright.
[125:26.80]Got it.
[125:29.02]No timer, right?
[125:29.74]I can do this?
[125:41.98]Here are your fireworks.
[125:42.92]He's still going.
[125:43.64]Still timed.
[125:44.10]Don't make, don't let me forget that.
[126:15.22]Because I will get out of this car and just start pressing buttons on stuff.
[126:23.66]Don't explode.
[126:24.52]I don't wanna do this whole fucking thing again.
[126:38.13]Ralph, word in the hood is that you got access to your old man's fireworks stash.
[126:41.37]Fireworks make my ears yell.
[126:43.61]Here's some gumdrops.
[126:44.71]Now make with the works.
[126:45.79]My daddy's going to put you in jail.
[126:48.33]Fine.
[126:48.49]That's terrifying.
[126:49.37]That's a terrifying Ralph.
[126:52.08]Alright, hold on a minute.
[126:54.16]I need a new car.
[126:56.82]Oh, fuck.
[126:57.34]This is gonna explode.
[126:58.16]My car's gonna explode.
[126:59.60]Can I steal a car as a fart?
[127:16.68]Am I gonna... is he... I don't understand what the bar is for.
[127:25.17]This is saying don't go this way.
[127:26.35]Is this the end of the game?
[127:28.31]No, it's not an invisible wall.
[127:29.27]Okay.
[127:29.47]I was just making sure that wasn't an invisible wall.
[127:39.01]Alright, I got it.
[127:44.15]Drive to the go-go-plex.
[127:54.31]Incoming great song.
[127:55.79]Can I just plow through this?
[128:07.47]No, I have to go all the way around.
[128:10.27]Wait, where's the... That guy is driving in the wrong place.
[128:41.74]Three detours.
[128:45.67]Is the passenger still in the taxi?
[128:47.11]Yeah, that's the one driving the taxi.
[128:48.87]That's how they can get away with this.
[128:49.85]Alright, comic book guy, what do you got?
[128:59.74]I think... Ready?
[129:00.78]Here it comes.
[129:01.90]Race to the nerd.
[129:02.50]Race the nerd to the Java server.
[129:03.74]You got it.
[129:35.55]How do I, how am I racing the nerd when I'm in the nerd's car?
[129:45.52]The other nerd.
[129:51.16]There's two nerds.
[129:54.50]Well, this nerd's car sucks.
[130:02.71]Glancing blow.
[130:03.35]Glancing blow.
[130:04.40]Bart Simpson at your service.
[130:05.92]Work speed.
[130:06.30]Alright, let's power through it.
[130:34.14]You can drive through trees.
[130:34.98]This is not... Man, this sucks.
[130:38.97]Unbelievable.
[130:53.95]Well, that just got a little more rare.
[130:56.35]That was totally awesome.
[130:58.67]Engage!
[130:59.80]I think you could have avoided...
[131:03.31]What was I supposed to do after that total failure at the beginning?
[131:21.45]Oh, that lady got fucking destroyed.
[131:29.51]We don't have deflector shields, you know.
[131:36.80]What the fuck was that?
[131:47.76]Lucky break.
[131:48.14]God.
[131:48.28]Furry animals.
[132:18.17]Wait, can I take his car?
[132:19.99]It's gone.
[132:20.69]Okay.
[132:25.08]So there's family sedan, fire truck limo, World War II vehicle, surveillance van, duff truck, electaurus.
[132:39.14]Speed, acceleration, toughness.
[132:43.73]This is the best thing.
[132:55.21]Alright, give me that.
[133:01.42]Alright.
[133:03.18]Good ol' Bart.
[133:05.84]Who doesn't like Bart, you know?
[133:08.46]It's a race right here.
[133:14.93]Let's do it.
[133:17.69]I don't- you don't like Bart?
[133:21.28]Hi, Mr. Lisa.
[133:22.36]If you win, the man ladies will give you a car.
[133:25.30]Bring it.
[133:27.76]Pass all checkpoints and cross the finish line first.
[133:30.55]Don't destroy your vehicle.
[133:32.45]Five, five, five, four.
[133:34.85]I mean, that was cute.
[133:38.77]That was cute.
[133:41.91]Why is there a taxi?
[133:44.39]Don't have a cow, man.
[133:47.88]Oh, boy.
[133:48.42]I'm sure I'm not driving against and racing against ghosts of my own driving.
[133:56.07]I'm just facing my own ghosts.
[134:02.01]This guy's gonna be hard to pass.
[134:13.52]We going on the highway?
[134:15.72]Yes, we are.
[134:21.47]Just pass him.
[134:22.85]No, he got to do the cool thing, and I didn't.
[134:33.57]Oh, did not expect that.
[134:34.45]It's over.
[134:34.91]I lost.
[134:46.19]I need a better car, probably.
[134:47.63]Yeah.
[134:48.81]Maybe, if I can get up there real quick.
[134:52.15]If you ain't fast, you're last.
[135:07.64]Yeah, that's true.
[135:12.76]Does this count if I don't... It does, okay.
[135:14.84]I don't have to touch them!
[135:16.16]I don't have to touch those!
[135:17.54]I just have to go... okay.
[135:20.88]That changes everything.
[135:23.74]I thought I actually had to go near that circle.
[135:25.94]Nah, you ain't gonna fuck that up.
[135:40.07]I'm in front now.
[135:42.61]The car's faster than mine.
[135:43.73]Sorry.
[135:44.47]That's not fair.
[135:45.67]Not fair.
[135:50.05]Just like in NASCAR, I can stay on the inside.
[136:02.14]How dare you!
[136:03.62]How dare you!
[136:05.50]Do that to me at the very end.
[136:07.36]Oh.
[136:10.18]Oh, I had it too.
[136:11.96]I just...
[136:15.77]Unbelievable!
[136:16.87]That was so stupid.
[136:26.37]How fuckin'... come on.
[136:30.23]That was bullshit too.
[136:31.69]It was just a bunch of bullshit.
[136:36.26]Alright, I'm alright again.
[136:37.04]Good.
[136:46.83]Just don't let that happen again.
[136:50.38]She's got a faster car than me.
[136:52.00]That's Lisa, right?
[136:56.32]Stay on the inside.
[136:59.12]She's right behind me.
[136:59.90]She's going to pass me.
[137:04.14]No, she's right here.
[137:05.38]I got a left-hand turn coming up.
[137:11.06]Got it.
[137:11.64]Okay.
[137:13.00]Don't... That's terrible.
[137:17.12]That was so close.
[137:26.74]Give it to me!
[137:27.52]Give me the car!
[137:32.06]I can't take the car.
[137:34.02]This car is so much better.
[137:34.94]Is it Lisa?
[137:41.21]I can't do anything about it.
[137:42.49]Not allowed.
[137:47.52]Who else has that hair?
[137:51.58]Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[137:57.53]We got a side mission.
[137:58.41]It's Grandpa.
[138:01.90]What do you need?
[138:04.99]I need your car from the war.
[138:06.47]The war?
[138:07.59]What, is the Kaiser at it again?
[138:09.59]I'll teach him.
[138:10.63]He stole my best girl and my best box of saltwater taffy.
[138:14.11]Grandpa, you're not making any sense.
[138:16.26]I'm tired because I let Jasper borrow my blood.
[138:19.28]I didn't think I'd need it.
[138:21.04]No.
[138:23.16]Saltwater taffy?
[138:25.76]I love saltwater taffy.
[138:27.29]Now you got my attention, chat.
[138:29.25]What is it?
[138:31.23]You need something?
[138:32.43]What's going on?
[138:41.09]Boomers like taffy.
[138:43.53]This camera control is in the menu.
[138:48.09]Hold on.
[138:54.07]Camera left.
[138:54.91]Oh, hold on a minute.
[138:57.40]Numpad 4.
[138:58.54]Camera left.
[139:00.90]Camera right.
[139:03.64]Camera move in.
[139:07.84]Camera move out.
[139:10.29]Camera, zoom.
[139:15.73]Camera, look up.
[139:22.19]Well, that's... Okay, thank God.
[139:29.58]Well.
[139:32.46]That's, uh... That changes everything.
[139:35.52]How many times have I said that?
[139:36.48]Well, that changes everything.
[139:38.68]Out of my way, man.
[139:43.27]Six?
[139:44.33]Come on!
[139:44.65]Where, where, where is it?
[139:45.93]Where is it?
[139:46.73]What?
[140:13.45]You got it.
[140:17.09]Finding blood is easy.
[140:18.29]I'd make a great vampire.
[140:19.99]I hope this is enough.
[140:22.59]Shut up and bark.
[140:23.34]Oops.
[140:28.02]Hey, slower traffic to the right, please.
[140:33.48]Out of the way, wannabe.
[140:37.25]I don't know why I did this.
[140:39.81]I don't remember these being here before.
[140:47.20]I have to keep going into modes over and over again.
[140:49.36]What if... Hello?
[140:59.22]Action button?
[141:01.12]I pressed it.
[141:01.60]Uh...
[141:14.94]I'm interacting with the dd jar well what come on I'm standing right here and it's like press action like I'm right here full speed ahead it's time for some road rage bart simpson style
[141:43.19]Wait, what?
[141:43.59]I thought he just gave it to me.
[141:45.77]Why did... Thanks a lot, Mr. Break My Legs.
[142:13.44]I fucked that guy up bad.
[142:18.68]Too many cars on the road.
[142:20.06]Give me some blood.
[142:34.87]I'm collecting everybody's blood.
[142:36.20]This is a little weird.
[142:37.36]I got a minute to go back to Grandpa.
[142:43.17]Eat ass?
[143:02.61]I must have the cops on me.
[143:08.31]Don't touch anybody.
[143:11.41]Oh, fuck.
[143:25.43]That's Bart's catchphrase.
[143:29.99]So glad to be of service.
[143:31.73]No, it's eat my shorts.
[143:33.89]Nice and warm.
[143:35.17]Just how I like it.
[143:36.49]Is that enough?
[143:37.15]I need another car.
[143:38.25]Take it.
[143:39.01]I'm going to pour this on my flapjacks.
[143:44.31]I got the new car.
[143:45.65]You've unlocked Grandpa's World War II vehicle.
[143:47.61]Go to a phone to use it.
[143:48.83]Okay.
[143:55.83]This thing's not bad.
[143:56.75]It's not eat my ass.
[143:59.02]No, it's eat my shorts.
[144:00.02]There it is.
[144:14.61]This thing is kind of tricky to move around.
[144:17.55]Wait!
[144:18.51]Had to get that.
[144:19.21]What is this up here?
[144:45.00]A little place to go?
[144:46.32]Ooh, would you look at this?
[144:51.07]What's that?
[144:51.69]Ooh!
[144:54.11]No!
[145:00.59]Aw.
[145:04.52]I'll get it.
[145:11.04]One, two, three, go!
[145:14.93]I can go over there too.
[145:16.11]Oops.
[145:18.41]Hurry!
[145:19.22]Give me the coins.
[145:26.12]All of them.
[145:26.44]Can I reach these without falling?
[145:27.90]Yes I can.
[145:28.60]What's this one?
[145:31.72]Mr. Honey Bunny.
[145:37.43]I'm gonna go this way too.
[145:40.39]I can platform over this thing.
[145:44.06]Having the camera controls make this a thousand times easier.
[145:47.32]Alright, there's a box over there.
[145:49.76]Another camera.
[146:04.93]Can I get them all?
[146:05.53]I think I can.
[146:05.99]I have to get it.
[146:16.39]The boxes have a lot of coins.
[146:17.23]I gotta get it.
[146:17.79]Stop moving.
[146:46.22]Alright, now just get it in the right spot.
[146:50.26]I almost blew the whole thing again.
[146:54.74]That's too many coins to just ignore.
[147:02.01]Sweet.
[147:03.61]Wait.
[147:04.33]No, that's nothing.
[147:05.75]Nothing over there?
[147:06.27]Let me just take a look.
[147:11.93]I got crossed to the crab.
[147:14.86]I can't make that jump.
[147:17.02]Can I jump over here?
[147:17.66]No.
[147:30.78]Alright, Grandpa, let's go.
[147:32.62]Take me to my destination.
[147:38.39]This handling is ridiculous.
[147:41.05]Is this car way?
[147:43.97]Like, 30 pounds?
[147:44.91]Look at this thing.
[147:47.59]Alright, this is a gamble.
[147:51.13]Now I've got controls.
[147:52.11]I know how to play the game.
[147:53.59]I think it's time to do one of these missions.
[147:57.65]25 cents, and then 75 cents.
[147:59.99]Complete an entire lap before the time runs out.
[148:01.83]Let's try it.
[148:03.56]Oh, I just realized I'm using this.
[148:07.08]I see it right there.
[148:10.32]What?
[148:22.01]I thought there was a place to turn in there.
[148:25.47]There's not.
[148:26.87]You can turn the other way.
[148:51.43]What the fuck am I on two wheels for?
[148:53.51]Why did that happen?
[148:55.91]Sorry.
[148:58.92]What?
[149:07.22]I'm... Wait, I'm getting... Hold on a second here.
[149:09.72]I'm getting more time.
[149:11.24]I might be able to still do this.
[149:16.29]Didn't think the old man had it in him, did ya?
[149:21.05]No, I'm not.
[149:21.63]That was a lie.
[149:22.51]It's just I have to do the whole thing and, yeah, fall left in 210.
[149:28.47]I don't even know why I'm doing this anymore.
[149:36.80]I should just delete and go do the mission.
[149:54.10]I just gave that guy $25.
[150:08.69]Downtown to the stadium.
[150:10.82]I want to go this way.
[150:12.70]Just look.
[150:14.54]See?
[150:24.02]Nice!
[150:30.94]That was cool.
[150:41.79]Talk to Professor Frank.
[150:45.61]I will do that in a second after I break the vending machines.
[150:48.03]No, wait.
[150:48.65]I want to get on the fountain here.
[150:55.05]I got a pregnancy test.
[151:01.99]I want to get up there.
[151:05.97]No other cards or coins or anything?
[151:12.77]Nope.

[151:53.77]Oh, cool.
[151:54.63]Real violence is way better than TV violence.
[151:57.43]It's like a level boss come to life.
[151:59.15]Video games.
[151:59.85]Video games.
[152:00.25]Who would have a World War II radio?
[152:03.33]That guy that sells all those grenades to Nelson might.
[152:05.99]I better check.
[152:09.39]Go to Herman's Military Antiques to find a World War II radio for Professor Frank.
[152:14.00]Fine by me.
[152:16.82]Oh, stop your daydreaming, Melonhead, and get in the car.
[152:28.95]Um, okay.
[152:34.21]So, I need to... tail this to the military place?
[152:41.76]Press select.
[152:45.28]Uh, I can't press select.
[152:46.96]Still bar.
[152:59.53]Alright, I'll fill the bar, and then you'll see what happens.
[153:04.03]Yeah, I can't believe we lost, Bart!
[153:06.83]Hot diggity!
[153:12.23]Please don't tell anybody I did this!
[153:15.37]What?
[153:15.61]I blame Lyndon Johnson!
[153:19.79]They'll never take me alive, I tell you!
[153:22.13]Where is this guy going?
[153:24.37]What the fuck is going on?
[153:26.01]Not the detailing!
[153:37.89]You have to follow it, not tail it.
[153:39.56]If it slows down, you slow down.
[153:42.72]And then they said, idiot.
[153:46.30]Okay.
[153:48.96]What?
[153:50.16]Alright.
[153:54.33]Is that really that big of a deal?
[153:57.08]Apparently.
[153:57.60]I'm going to find the thief.
[153:58.62]Everyone's telling me to press select, but I can't press select on the controller.
[154:03.00]It doesn't do anything.
[154:25.48]So, uh... Like, there is no select.
[154:29.98]What is it on the keyboard?
[154:31.67]Like, escape?
[154:35.47]Because that's... I can't... The select button.
[154:45.17]It doesn't do anything.
[154:46.43]Start doesn't do anything either.
[154:51.58]Press the select key.
[154:55.54]Alright, can I... I'm just gonna play the damn game.
[154:57.46]Press the any key.
[155:08.30]I know that reference.
[155:09.90]That's Homer Simpson.
[155:17.98]What?
[155:21.54]Hey, Snake, what's up?
[155:23.16]Um, do I know you, little dude?
[155:25.04]I need that radio you borrowed.
[155:27.08]No way, little dude.
[155:28.98]This radio is going to help me score beau coup de chicks.
[155:33.93]Uh, last time I checked, chicks like fast cars, not vintage electronics.
[155:38.19]Why don't we race for the radio?
[155:40.29]Oh, I totally agree to your proposal.
[155:44.27]Alright, Snake.
[155:48.58]You and me.
[155:59.60]Alright, there's other cars on the road.
[156:00.74]I don't want to fuck this up.
[156:04.00]Why, is everything solved in races?
[156:07.22]That's a great question.
[156:11.80]Can't they just do, like, once, twice, three, shoot?
[156:17.09]Do we have to put everybody in danger?
[156:22.39]I wasn't first.
[156:23.47]I'll get it.
[156:23.83]Hold on, I'll get it.
[156:25.91]I'll cut him off up here.
[156:32.54]Extreme to the max!
[156:34.88]You cheated, cheater!
[156:35.78]How is it even possible that you're still ahead of me?
[156:37.90]Don't forget to ride!
[156:39.32]I don't even... How is this possible?
[156:42.20]I'll accept it.
[156:42.98]Apparently I'm going to accept this.
[156:44.22]Oh, now come on!
[156:50.47]I can't believe I just won.
[156:51.61]That's unbelievable.
[156:55.17]There's no way that that just happened.
[156:57.77]I won, though.
[156:58.93]Who has those anymore?
[157:01.53]Oh!
[157:04.63]God, gamer.
[157:12.97]Alright, peel it out, Grandpa.
[157:14.61]Let's go.
[157:18.58]Jerma press select.
[157:19.58]Jerma press select.
[157:20.32]Jerma press select.
[157:21.58]Jerma press select.
[157:38.88]Uh, I already did that one.
[157:49.12]What's this?
[157:49.88]Hold on, is a catapult here?
[157:53.41]Wait a minute.
[157:54.13]I need to examine a catapult.
[157:58.67]Really?
[157:59.29]Who can I... Was there an animal in there?
[158:09.10]It was.
[158:09.60]Why am I launching... Why am I doing this?
[158:13.46]That's not right.
[158:14.08]We gotta race.
[158:25.43]A cat occult.
[158:30.77]A trebuchet.
[158:32.74]Complete all laps and finish the race in first place.
[158:34.70]Don't destroy your vehicle.
[158:35.70]Psych!
[158:55.79]I select to win race.
[158:57.27]Eat my dust, dust eaters.
[158:59.53]Sorry, I gotta jump in here.
[159:00.41]That's me.
[159:01.41]That's just Ash from Pokémon.
[159:04.09]That's like Ash being really mad and mean.
[159:06.21]Alright.
[159:08.20]That concludes my contribution.
[159:09.68]Goodbye.
[159:10.04]This is what they do.
[159:10.74]Every mission so far for the race missions have been we're gonna put two dickheads on the road and then the guy in first place is the one you're actually racing against.
[159:19.48]The other two people are just obstacles in your way.
[159:23.45]Don't have a cow, man.
[159:26.08]Because now I'm so... Lookit, I'm so far behind.
[159:27.57]How am I gonna catch up in time?
[159:36.35]I gotta get in first.
[159:37.61]Immediately.
[159:42.70]Is there a shortcut I can do?

[161:06.48]Get in there!
[161:07.00]Good.
[161:07.78]She lost it there for a second.
[161:18.96]Having trouble.
[161:22.20]Stay on the inside.
[161:22.92]I don't want to run into you.
[161:34.55]And that's exactly what I didn't want to have happen.
[161:38.03]What did he just say?
[161:38.91]Hold on.
[161:40.81]What?
[161:41.09]What?
[161:50.62]Alright.
[161:51.88]Every time I end up bumping into you here.
[161:53.64]Oh!
[161:57.52]Come on.
[161:59.90]Come on.
[162:01.34]Come on.
[162:01.80]This is the end.
[162:02.36]Oh yeah.
[162:02.70]I totally rule.
[162:20.48]I gotta do the last one and get the car for this stage, right?
[162:23.48]I'm not gonna lie, I was just pressing up on the d-pad to call the horse.
[162:32.41]Alright, look at the last race.
[162:53.99]Where is the final race?
[162:55.65]I don't know.
[163:05.06]Wow, that was interesting.
[163:08.68]You can go through here.
[163:11.00]That was totally awesome.
[163:13.10]You're all mine.
[163:14.78]Whoa, wicked.
[163:16.48]Oh, I spilled my sea bag.
[163:24.77]Press select for the map.
[163:29.94]There is no map.
[163:33.18]Yes there is.
[163:39.82]I just pressed M. Select to use boost.
[163:55.10]Ooh, how do I get that?
[163:56.10]Get out of here, B. Alright, if I climb up there, I should get it.
[164:09.80]Right here.
[164:21.04]Kind of hard to see.
[164:25.26]Damn, this is tricky.
[164:31.29]The camera doesn't want to stay in the right place.
[164:49.35]Big Butt Skinner.
[164:50.69]Alright, over to the Krusty Burger.
[165:04.26]Speaking of burgers, I could go for a burger.
[165:07.16]A huge one.
[165:09.95]A double, at least.
[165:12.45]I would take a triple.
[165:16.85]No, that's too much.
[165:20.48]I'm gonna sneeze now.
[165:21.08]Can I mutant type?
[165:22.16]Did I get it?
[165:23.94]I think I got it.
[165:24.68]Best burger place?
[165:25.40]I'm a big fan of Shake Shack.
[165:54.86]I'm gonna get all these.
[166:09.53]Five Guys is good.
[166:11.55]Shake Shack, but I would put Shake Shack above Five Guys.
[166:20.46]We're talking, like, counter-serve burgers and, yeah, Shake Shack.
[166:23.52]Yes.
[166:25.00]Yeah, that's number one.
[166:33.25]Um, can you please not be directly in the path that I need?
[166:36.23]And the train's coming!
[166:47.85]best restaurant burger actually sitting down at a restaurant.
[166:54.43]Uh, I had the best burger I've ever had in my life.
[166:58.49]And it's, uh, it's down in, uh, down on the strip.
[167:05.50]Oh, fuck, I have to deliver this now.
[167:12.18]Uh, the Hash House has the best burger I've ever had in my whole life.
[167:16.11]from a sit-down restaurant.
[167:17.07]It was absolutely fucking unbelievable.
[167:24.21]Am I gonna make this?
[167:36.30]Am I not paying attention?
[167:38.58]Did I fuck something?
[167:39.24]No, I'm not.
[167:39.60]I'm fine.
[167:42.05]If I had In-N-Out.
[167:42.77]Yeah, I'm not a fan of In-N-Out.
[167:44.59]I'm... I don't really... No, I'm not like a big fan of In-N-Out.
[167:47.90]I think it's just kind of like a Wendy's cheeseburger that's cheap.
[167:52.96]Sorry, guys.
[167:56.26]What?
[167:56.56]Get away from... I don't hate In-N-Out.
[167:58.46]I think it's good.
[167:59.32]But I think it's like a... It's like a step up from a place like Wendy's, I think.
[168:03.65]The best thing about In-N-Out is In-N-Out is really fast and it's really cheap.
[168:06.75]I'm not going to lose right now.
[168:29.90]But, I don't know, I... Me and Star went to In-N-Out.
[168:33.76]And people were like, Go to In-N-Out!
[168:34.93]Go to In-N-Out!
[168:35.37]Go to In-N-Out!
[168:35.67]We went to In-N-Out, and it was... Both of us said the same thing.
[168:39.79]We were like, Oh, that was alright, I guess.
[168:41.55]I'm going the wrong way.
[168:55.26]There's nothing wrong with In-N-Out.
[168:56.80]It's just... I don't think it's at this extreme god-like level that some people say it is.
[169:01.00]Stop it.
[169:01.52]Stop it.
[169:01.86]Got it.
[169:28.61]But I think that's the problem, though, because it's just like a good hamburger.
[169:34.95]People lift it up to be this thing that you have to eat, and God will come down and grace you when you put it in your mouth.
[169:46.14]Like, once you take a bite of an In-N-Out burger, God appears and says, Don't you like that I made it for you?
[169:51.63]Nice driving, man.
[170:01.39]My compliments to the chef.
[170:02.52]Dude, the last race?
[170:03.42]Is this the last mission?
[170:04.86]Maybe I'll just cancel it then.
[170:06.28]Well, I guess I'm not even doing it, so...
[170:35.15]Alright, where is the last race?
[170:36.97]We got one here, we already did that one.
[170:38.90]I don't wanna do that yet.
[170:48.88]Not yet.
[170:54.66]Somebody just said, In-N-Out is a slightly better McDonald's.
[170:58.98]I don't know if I would go that far, to say that.
[171:12.84]And, no, I did that one.
[171:14.00]Where's the last one?
[171:24.24]Oh, there's the two there.
[171:25.48]They're right next to each other.
[171:26.36]Anybody know where it is?
[171:36.55]I have no fucking idea.
[171:42.12]Why is everybody ad- hold on, wait, why is everybody adding... add... What are you doing?
[171:55.62]What are you doing?
[171:57.30]No, stop this.
[171:58.22]Stop this nonsense!
[172:03.83]What is this?
[172:07.77]Sorry, I just saw them and I had to... What are you doing?
[172:17.47]You guys are distracting the fuck out of me right now.
[172:24.61]Did I break the phone?
[172:25.81]Get out of the taxi!
[172:31.36]I can still use it.
[172:32.08]Alright, I want the family car.
[172:42.42]Alright, alright, alright.
[172:48.11]Am I gonna have to, like, put it into fuckin' slowdown mode?
[172:56.37]Last race is next to Sneed.
[172:58.36]Where is that, though?
[173:00.26]I haven't seen this television show in my life.
[173:02.22]Over this way?
[173:07.72]Alright, am I going the right way?
[173:09.92]If I go through the buzz cola sign.
[173:18.20]Did I just say something I shouldn't have said?
[173:23.40]It's near the fire truck ramp.
[173:25.74]That's kind of far away.
[173:39.76]Did I actually just say something?
[173:47.42]There's Moe's.
[173:49.32]Head down here.
[173:50.84]This is the factory.
[174:07.93]I really don't know where the hell I'm even going.
[174:09.61]Hey, guys, just be honest with me.
[174:18.74]Am I even going remotely in the right direction?
[174:28.31]No.
[174:30.89]I passed it?
[174:32.31]No, I didn't.
[174:38.31]The mini-map.
[174:39.63]But there's nothing on the mini-map.
[174:41.33]There's just that flip.
[174:48.42]I'm looking for the... the race.
[174:50.48]Downtown... Sneed is not downtown.
[174:55.48]Just go in any direction long enough and you're gonna find it.
[175:18.78]What the fuck?
[175:20.72]Alright, you know what?
[175:22.22]I... I don't... I... Found it!
[175:29.10]Take this!
[175:33.44]Oh, awesome, man!
[175:34.42]That was the best ride ever!
[175:35.72]Milhouse, what are you doing here?
[175:38.70]I thought you had a four o'clock wedgie with Nelson.
[175:41.00]I rescheduled.
[175:42.58]The DMV has us all doing these stupid races.
[175:46.33]This state...
[175:50.22]pump now man I'm so amped up for this three two one this is a weird did I do something wrong
[176:19.39]I don't... this is weird.
[176:30.72]Am I going the right way?
[176:31.48]Do I have to actually... I'm so confused.
[176:41.93]One more lap?
[176:52.94]What the hell is going on?
[176:57.66]Somebody said, go through the roundabout, and I don't know why I even looked at the chat.
[177:01.18]Go through the roundabout.
[177:02.38]What am I doing?
[177:04.64]You can't.
[177:05.16]You have to go around the whole thing.
[177:09.19]Go through the roundabout.
[177:10.09]There's a roundabout.
[177:10.89]What are you doing?
[177:11.61]And I'm like, aye, aye, yeah.
[177:14.73]Yeah.
[177:24.87]He's very smart.
[177:38.46]This time, I'm not gonna look at chat.
[177:40.08]I'm just gonna do it.
[177:41.86]I'm so fucking mad.
[177:43.46]I'm so fucking mad.
[177:52.18]It only took like... Well, how long did it take?
[177:54.78]Was it two hours?
[177:55.76]No, it's been a while.
[177:56.86]I haven't had like a meltdown yet.
[177:59.18]No, there aren't going to be a meltdown tonight.
[178:00.66]This is Simpsons.
[178:01.46]Bart Simpson drives around and throws stuff and runs away.
[178:05.50]I'm not going to get angry at it.
[178:08.30]Why would that happen?
[178:15.03]I just saved two or three full seconds.
[178:23.54]You already are.
[178:24.52]I'm not.
[178:25.16]You would know if I was.
[178:26.30]I would have made like a weird sound effect.
[178:30.02]You know what I mean?
[178:30.82]Do it.
[178:46.06]It's right here.
[178:52.59]Next time you stay at our place, you can have the steamed vegetable of your choice.
[178:56.64]Give it up for America's bad boy.
[178:59.26]Go to the phone booth to get Moe's Sedan.
[179:06.36]How typical.
[179:09.19]Let's check it out.
[179:17.13]Moe's Sedan.
[179:18.09]It's not bad.
[179:26.56]This is one, one-and-a-half, two-and-a-half, four.
[179:30.08]One, one-and-a-half, two-and-a-half, four.
[179:32.08]One, one-and-a-half, two-and-a-half, four.
[179:33.94]Two, one-and-a-half, two-and-a-half, three-and-a-half.
[179:36.52]That's better.
[179:39.14]So now I actually... It's not Moe driving the car.
[179:48.27]This is just... This is actually a child driving this car.
[179:50.61]I mean, I gotta go over that.
[179:53.61]How could I not do that?
[179:59.61]Not enough speed.
[180:00.38]Come on.
[180:00.64]What are you trying?
[180:01.22]There are over 5,000 people here.
[180:02.48]You're gonna just drive over that?
[180:04.44]Just slowly?
[180:05.64]Are you kidding me?
[180:20.61]Come on, streamer.
[180:21.29]You gotta impress us.
[180:24.98]Oh yeah, baby.
[180:26.00]Bring it on.
[180:32.26]Alright, Professor Frank, I got your stuff.
[180:36.80]There you go.
[180:37.16]Everybody... Looking over in the chat, it's just so many emotions.
[180:39.92]I don't even know which one to... to interact with.
[181:08.32]There's so much going on over here.
[181:09.86]Alright, talk to Dr. Nick.
[181:27.03]No, I ain't playing.
[181:29.04]I'm not playing a fucking OST I'm not playing an OST right now
[181:55.16]That's not gonna happen.
[181:56.92]No.
[181:58.50]You'll need the... Plow truck.
[182:01.86]Purchase it from Homer in the hospital parking lot for 200 coins.
[182:07.78]Don't I already own it?
[182:08.48]I already own it.
[182:30.83]There was a T-pose there.
[182:31.87]I can't wait to see it in chat.
[182:33.49]Now we're in emote only.
[182:34.41]Emote only.
[182:34.95]Oh, the fucking title sucks.
[182:36.27]This title sucks such ass.
[182:37.87]I forgot.
[182:38.65]That's a placeholder.
[183:01.73]I just looked over and saw it.
[183:02.77]Oh well.
[183:10.43]Find all the monkeys before they escape.
[183:14.73]30 of... Oh god.
[183:17.73]Okay, I gotta go to one corner of the map.
[183:21.21]This is not good.
[183:24.33]How the hell am I gonna do this?
[183:27.26]Alright, they start here.
[183:38.15]No!
[183:38.65]I just lost their mind.
[183:46.13]Why is everybody freaking out?
[183:53.89]Oh, I gotta pay attention.
[183:55.19]Alright, we'll have a chat.
[183:57.53]Later.
[184:10.18]across here in town.
[184:21.00]I'm good.
[184:21.40]I got almost halfway there and I got plenty of time.
[184:25.05]Um, oh dear, there's platforming involved in this.
[184:30.37]Platforming's involved.
[184:32.69]I thought it was just driving.
[184:37.11]Oh, shit.
[184:43.64]Shit.
[184:43.98]How do I... Get up there.
[184:50.95]I see it.
[184:51.33]It's right here.
[184:51.89]That's it.
[184:52.77]Turn around.
[184:53.93]Any more on top of roofs or anything?
[185:12.19]Get in the car!
[185:22.94]You're all mine.
[185:26.92]Wow.
[185:28.26]17.
[185:28.28]18.
[185:28.30]19.
[185:29.92]Time to lay some rubber down.
[185:37.92]Come on.
[185:38.69]Get through there.
[185:39.75]That was expensive.
[185:46.44]I got plenty of time, just don't freak out about it.
[185:55.25]I'm still missing five.
[186:01.25]Where on Earth are the other five?
[186:04.03]Forget about the bee, it's not important.
[186:12.61]Jump to light speed, Bart.
[186:14.87]That doesn't exist.
[186:15.49]I got it.
[186:16.35]And then end it on the stairs.
[186:39.84]Alright.
[186:40.12]That was not... I didn't need to panic at all.
[186:41.48]That was... I'm done.
[186:44.22]Drive to the Screaming Monkey Medical Center.
[186:46.42]What?
[186:46.56]Got it.
[187:01.83]Don't deliver them.
[187:02.73]Why wouldn't I deliver them?
[187:03.83]Oh, I see.
[187:29.33]I kind of like the plow.
[187:30.17]I didn't like it at first, but now I do.
[187:34.21]I'm back.
[187:45.44]What were the popular cell phones that existed back then?
[187:47.22]This is what, 2004?
[187:47.64]Was the original iPhone even out?
[188:09.96]Destroy all the cell phone users' cars before time runs out.
[188:14.34]Get into your car.
[188:18.67]No, this is like old flip phones, right?
[188:21.63]This is gonna be a horrible mission.
[188:38.95]She just baited me.
[188:40.60]So bad.
[188:42.08]Did you really just do that to me?
[188:51.22]Phones that are attached to cars.
[188:54.86]You motherfucker, I swear to God.
[189:06.67]No!
[189:18.82]Look at how easy that is.
[189:27.96]He's almost done.
[189:32.01]Very alien music, too.
[189:42.89]You should be done.
[189:44.43]You should be dead.
[189:48.35]Destroyed.
[189:48.95]Ah, there's another one back here.
[189:50.51]Are you turning around?
[189:53.85]What way are you driving?
[189:59.43]Oh, dummy.
[189:59.93]Get out of the way.
[190:00.51]Where are you going?
[190:11.26]Perfect.
[190:14.55]I think time is added for every car that's destroyed.
[190:17.61]That would be really bad if it didn't.
[190:27.66]I think my face cam's not on.
[190:29.16]That would have been an embarrassing face.
[190:30.78]Okay.
[190:44.28]I just bit down on my lower mouth.
[190:47.33]I like ate the bottom half of my mouth.
[191:00.74]Fucking tubers.
[191:02.00]This is a really bad day.
[191:10.65]A sad day for a generic amount.
[191:15.59]Those fucking tubers.
[191:23.75]Get him!
[191:24.35]Would you just get him?
[191:25.23]I didn't do it.
[191:32.64]My butt hurts.
[191:47.29]Why does that not count?
[191:48.99]My car is gonna explode, I need a wrench.
[191:55.22]I got it.
[191:59.34]Alright, where's the wrench?
[192:02.00]Is the wrench up here, I think.
[192:03.00]Right at the top, right?
[192:06.71]Yep.
[192:09.23]Stupid!
[192:10.93]You're stupid!
[192:14.20]Alright, you're fine.
[192:14.96]You're smart.
[192:19.72]You're stupid!
[192:25.97]Full throttle, right in the back.
[192:27.11]That's not what I wanted.
[192:32.61]That's no damage at all.
[192:34.75]Did his car use my car as a brake?
[192:40.96]No, other way around.
[192:50.86]Come here.
[192:52.72]Come here.
[193:03.60]What the heck were you thinking?
[193:05.94]That's totally awesome.
[193:06.66]He's doing it to himself.
[193:07.60]Good.
[193:09.12]I win.
[193:09.74]Oh, that was so cool.
[193:15.62]There's a sign right here.
[193:16.74]Got it.
[193:18.60]I got three and a half minutes.
[193:19.82]3.50.
[193:20.60]I'm good to go.
[193:22.40]Just gonna wrap around.

[193:29.11]That was a hard one.

[194:54.81]707, 101, 33.
[194:59.23]I didn't get any new clothes for Bart.
[195:15.62]No new clothes for Bart.
[195:17.98]It's time for Lisa?
[195:19.44]Yep.
[195:27.90]I get Lisa's car, which is the best car in the game.
[195:32.91]Might as well look and see what the other costumes are.
[195:38.65]Lisa, cool.
[195:45.08]What?
[195:47.16]Hockey.
[195:53.72]I mean, I have to get that.
[195:59.75]Toy Train.
[196:00.69]I know what it's like to build one of those.
[196:05.83]Is there a dead person in that costume?
[196:10.78]It is the YouTuber outfit.
[196:12.60]You're right.
[196:12.98]This is the streamer outfit.
[196:17.93]Funny streamer outfit.
[196:18.67]Yeah, it is.
[196:19.51]Raise the nerd to the Itchy and Scratchy store.
[196:21.27]Get the comic book back before time runs out.
[196:23.09]Oh, it's a different nerd.
[196:24.17]It's like... I don't like the nerd heart.
[197:07.75]Let's just do this thing.
[197:12.03]I need full impulse power.
[197:13.83]Gotta go.
[197:16.34]Impatient.
[197:18.40]No, I just don't.
[197:19.30]That's a guaranteed loss.
[197:20.48]I am so sick of this happening.
[197:25.51]I'm not going to dignify that until they come in.
[197:37.51]I'm so far ahead of him.
[197:44.34]Should I go over this?
[198:04.00]Got the comic.
[198:04.62]Oh, shit.
[198:05.04]They don't let you take a break.
[198:07.20]It's just... Now it's time to go fast again.
[198:13.44]You get to go really fast.
[198:37.38]I stopped.
[198:37.96]I spilled my squishy.
[198:40.02]Sorry!
[198:45.54]No!
[198:48.52]No!
[198:48.91]No!
[198:51.47]And just where do you think you are going?
[198:57.85]You better run!
[198:59.07]I think you could have avoided that.
[199:00.41]Well, that just got a little more rare.
[199:03.47]Moons of Xanthor!
[199:10.49]Nice spill joke.
[199:14.09]Now to get this inky treasure into its Mylar sanctuary.
[199:17.35]What about Bart?
[199:19.03]I asked you, have you seen him?
[199:21.03]I think I saw him at the Noiseland Arcade.
[199:24.22]Ugh, video games.
[199:25.78]What a waste of money.
[199:27.54]Now to go online and bid $1,000 for itchy and scratchy corncob holders.
[199:32.58]A terrific, terrific expense.
[199:34.20]I am the lizard queen!
[199:43.47]Oh, really?
[199:45.49]I don't think you're going to be doing that anytime soon.
[199:47.23]Alright, hold on.
[199:55.99]I don't want to do this yet.
[199:57.31]Let me look around.
[199:59.61]There's money everywhere.
[200:08.16]Secrets.
[200:09.08]Gags.
[200:09.64]I don't want to just blow through the whole video game.
[200:16.75]Plus, I gotta pee.
[200:18.89]Don't you know that Jeremy goes pee every two to three hours on the dot?
[200:24.35]That's just what happens.
[200:27.53]I missed a coin.
[200:28.77]Who cares?
[200:29.21]Alright, there's a machine over there.
[200:35.21]What is this?
[200:35.87]Gag!
[200:47.15]It's time for a meltdown.
[200:50.49]Is this a meltdown mission?
[200:51.81]I don't know if it is.
[201:02.12]Please change the outfit.
[201:03.14]It sucks.
[201:04.32]Thanks.
[201:07.53]No, I can't.
[201:08.33]Not that quickly.
[201:09.13]Is this $250?
[201:09.37]Not until you're like 16.
[201:17.95]You don't want to drink coffee until you're at least, like, 15 or 16, at least.
[201:27.57]Ooh.
[201:28.01]Why is that?
[201:29.79]Because... I started drinking coffee when I was 20.
[201:45.73]I just look like Gumby.
[201:47.23]Didn't Gumby drive around in a car like this?
[201:48.93]Alright, I gotta pee.
[201:57.14]I'll be right back.
[202:00.04]See you in, like, three minutes.
[202:27.03]Thank you.
[204:19.22]Hey.
[204:24.22]Let's go.
[204:34.39]Don't scare me like that.
[204:36.41]What, I muted the mic and I just went, hey.
[204:43.59]What is Lisa's double jump?
[204:45.79]Hold on, let me just open this fresh beer.
[204:59.06]Ooh.
[204:59.36]It's a ginger ale.
[205:02.72]Relax.
[205:02.98]It's a Canada Dry.
[205:03.82]Prove it.
[205:04.96]I can't.
[205:05.52]I don't have any clothes on.
[205:26.72]I'm going to go wrap a blanket around myself and then turn the camera on for a second.
[205:30.54]Well, that somehow fucked me up completely.
[205:44.76]Lisa's car is the best.
[205:45.90]Oh, I don't know why you just freaked me out doing that.
[205:48.92]But you did.
[205:49.38]Head of the class!
[205:53.27]This is just a temporary setting.
[206:01.49]Are you really coming up behind me right now?
[206:06.17]Uh, what?
[206:09.58]Easy!
[206:10.20]Alright, I gotta be careful going down.
[206:12.08]And you went perfectly down there.
[206:14.62]No way.
[206:15.00]I don't believe that for a second.
[206:23.83]You're in second place, Lisa.
[206:28.75]Alright, now go down gently.
[206:32.36]I'm gonna... fuck.
[206:43.78]I can still get it.
[206:46.14]Still pretty... pretty possible.
[206:51.55]Okay, easy.
[206:54.13]Got it.
[206:55.33]Oh, it's gonna be close.
[206:58.41]Right up my ass.
[206:59.49]Ah!
[206:59.55]Don't!
[207:09.79]Why did you?
[207:16.05]Oh, don't!
[207:16.85]Are we good?
[207:34.38]Can I get my car back, please?
[207:35.95]Thank you.
[207:38.35]What is this?
[207:40.42]Bonus!
[207:45.01]Principal Skinner, Bart's missing.
[207:47.36]Bart's gone?
[207:48.78]What a tragedy.
[207:50.36]To get your mind off this terrible loss, which we all feel, why don't you run a few errands, or as I call them, grief helpers for me?
[207:56.59]But Bart's only missing.
[207:58.19]Well, looking for that little monster.
[207:59.95]I mean, treasure can't help anything.
[208:03.27]You might as well pick up Mother's Dragon for me.
[208:04.71]Skinner looks like a bird.
[208:08.36]Lisa Simpson at your service.
[208:12.53]You might as well pick up my dry cleaning for me.
[208:18.15]You might as well pick up my dry... No, nevermind.
[208:19.93]Fine, mother.
[208:23.55]Nope.
[208:23.79]It's really hard to do that on an empty stomach.
[208:36.99]You've got to eat a shitload of greasy food before you can do that voice.
[208:42.55]End of the stream, boys.
[208:44.07]What are you on about?
[208:45.07]I'm still enjoying The Simpsons hit-and-run video game.
[208:47.05]Why would I turn the stream off right now?
[209:05.22]Care-care-care for a steamed ab?
[209:10.17]Ha-ha!
[209:10.91]Ha!
[209:11.41]Ha!
[209:11.91]Ha!
[209:12.39]Ha!
[209:12.87]Ha!
[209:13.41]Ha!
[209:15.17]I've seen that video.
[209:16.55]I have nine seconds!
[209:17.61]Ha-ha!
[209:18.03]Ha-ha!
[209:18.29]Ha!
[209:34.77]Stupid!
[209:35.85]Are we in Europe?
[209:41.85]How am I a bad driver?
[209:43.41]It's Principal Skinner driving.
[209:49.69]But I have seen the hams video.
[209:51.55]I've seen it before.
[209:59.73]I can't believe he's playing my childhood game.
[210:01.87]It holds up pretty well.
[210:03.23]It kind of does.
[210:26.90]I mean, if this was on the PlayStation... This is on PC, by the way.
[210:31.17]I have it for PlayStation 2.
[210:33.53]But I feel like it would be better on PC.
[210:36.91]The graphics and shit.
[210:39.69]You know what I mean.
[210:44.29]The PS2 version runs at like 20 FPS.
[210:45.78]That probably would have been unbearable to watch.
[210:49.31]Hold on.
[210:49.51]Alright, I think I'm okay.
[210:50.87]Now I'm gonna sneeze.
[210:52.05]Do you guys ever, like, choke on air?
[211:19.25]I just talked and I said too many words on my throat and I just choked on my own voice.
[211:25.06]I'm good.
[211:29.14]Where's my car?
[211:29.80]Oh, the casino.
[211:34.88]I don't like everything's timed.
[211:36.46]Everything's timed.
[211:49.32]It makes it too stressful.
[212:01.13]I'm missing a place to jump down quickly, I think.
[212:11.28]It's right ahead.
[212:13.60]Is this right?
[212:14.88]Okay, I'm gonna get it right over the jump.
[212:16.86]No, it's right there.
[212:23.96]I don't have the timer anymore.
[212:25.39]Okay.
[212:25.53]Relax.
[212:25.69]Get up there.
[212:28.23]I just have to go near it and activate it.
[212:52.93]I forgot I was this character uh Dr nick I'm here to pick up principal skinner's personal items hi little girl are you so cute here's the principal's anti-fungal cream thank you push him into the ocean
[213:36.02]It wasn't even the worst joke.
[213:37.30]That was fun.
[213:37.96]I can't believe that one.
[213:43.24]That one over me taking 15 minutes to sync up and queue up a Nightcrawler line from X-Men 2.
[213:52.60]Really?
[213:59.27]Speaking of fucking really... Yes, mother...
[214:07.65]No!
[214:08.01]What the- I- The pr- I pressed, like, uh, they came up so- Whatever.
[214:27.94]I could be so angry at this.
[214:30.52]God damn it.
[214:33.42]Ah.
[214:42.04]I don't... Wait.
[214:44.70]Can you just fail missions?
[214:46.80]You just don't finish them.
[214:48.56]So I just... I can't do that one again.
[214:52.14]I just skipped it.
[215:11.34]Oh.
[215:17.55]Who's driving the car?
[215:19.31]It's not a millhouse, is it?
[215:23.16]Hey, wasn't I just talking to you?
[215:31.90]I was just- you just- I was- What's going on?
[215:33.88]Maybe just- stop.
[215:34.42]Drive to Planet Hype.
[215:35.48]Uh, do you think I can do that in the chat, please?
[216:21.30]Can't go that way.
[216:28.75]Idiot, get out of my way.
[216:41.96]I'm not gonna make it.
[216:43.34]I'm not gonna make it.
[216:44.04]I'm not gonna make it.
[216:45.18]I'm not gonna make it.
[216:47.24]I'm not gonna make it.
[216:53.06]What just happened to all my money?
[217:22.80]What?
[217:25.76]How much money did it take?
[217:31.24]They just took so much money from me.
[217:34.81]What?
[217:54.46]From here, I guess just... I'm just going through here.
[217:58.92]I won't question the value of this activity.
[218:01.81]Not the car!
[218:06.39]I can go, girl.
[218:07.93]I need speed.
[218:10.27]More speed!
[218:12.50]Looks like I'm not in the ninth...
[218:22.51]I thought it was a shortcut and I could go through.
[218:25.39]Apparently not.
[218:38.24]Apparently not.
[218:41.62]Speaking of shortcuts, there's one right... I missed it already.
[218:46.08]There's another one right there.
[219:05.69]Is this going to work if I go over this?
[219:07.15]Because I had to go down all the way to the beach.
[219:11.29]Can I drive through this?
[219:12.47]Oh, no!
[219:13.97]And that was efficient.
[219:24.13]What a perfect day.
[219:27.54]Before I do this, get the car in the right spot, please.
[219:30.94]I need speed.
[219:31.72]More speed.
[219:34.12]Oh, hi, Lisa.
[219:40.08]Efficient to drown.
[219:42.16]Maybe.
[219:44.76]Can I pull?
[219:46.08]No, there's no way to pull left here.
[219:55.71]I have to stay here.
[219:58.97]Straight down, and then... I don't know if that's a little shortcut that I can go through with the Krusty Clown thing.
[220:05.78]It looks like it, but maybe I went the wrong way?
[220:14.95]I mean, it looks like I can go through here.
[220:19.29]No, I can't.
[220:19.85]It's just, it's a debate.
[220:20.85]It's bullshit.
[220:21.63]It's horse shit.
[220:23.49]It's just horse shit.
[220:24.73]What's happening?
[220:33.69]That's gonna happen again.
[220:37.08]Oh my lord in heaven, give me a break.
[220:39.00]Oh my god.
[220:39.68]Lisa Simpson at your service.
[220:47.12]You have a gift for speed.
[220:50.12]This reminds me of when I was a little girl.
[221:09.39]I don't want your shitty car.
[221:11.53]Give me back my good car.
[221:14.18]Where's a phone?
[221:25.30]Give me the Lisa Simpson best car in the game car, please.
[221:29.87]Oh, come on!
[221:43.53]Give me a wrench so I can have a... There's a card up there, but you know what?
[221:49.98]Here's a wrench.
[221:50.60]I'm ready.
[222:17.55]Can't turn that way.
[222:30.70]Alright.
[222:31.94]I'm gonna try- I got enough speed, I think.
[222:37.66]Oh, shit!
[222:39.00]I made it!
[222:39.38]I did it, I did it!
[222:39.96]Okay, we're fine!
[222:40.86]Everything's fine!
[222:41.94]Now... Now we relax.
[222:49.74]I'm ready.
[222:51.07]This is the last time I'm gonna do this shit.
[222:52.99]Here we go.
[222:54.07]Go!
[223:05.30]Don't- I'm- I can't just drive on the boardwalk like this and not get in trouble.
[223:10.20]Here we go.
[223:17.73]Don't go through the fake shortcut.
[223:19.87]It's not real.
[223:21.23]Just drive there.
[223:35.20]What is happening with the car?
[223:40.99]I did it.
[223:48.59]Taking it to the streets.
[223:50.71]Alright, Milhouse, what do you got?
[223:52.01]Hi, Lisa.
[223:53.63]My, your hair looks pointy today.
[223:56.21]Milhouse, have you seen Bart or not?
[224:00.43]So, Lisa, do you have a date for the harvest camp?
[224:03.78]Kick him into the water.
[224:04.64]No.
[224:04.82]This is not a good time.
[224:06.26]It's never a good time.
[224:08.28]If this is the end of the mission, then I will.
[224:11.50]Bart always comes out at the quickie mart.
[224:13.46]Maybe Apu has seen him.
[224:16.29]Alright, mission complete.
[224:17.13]Oh.
[224:44.25]Alright, I'm going for it.
[224:46.01]No, never mind.
[224:47.69]I was trying to drop the car on him.
[224:49.15]Why am I doing that to Milhouse?
[224:50.49]Just drive!
[224:57.72]Drop like a car on him.
[225:10.13]Nobody likes Milhouse.
[225:12.54]Somebody does.
[225:14.34]I'm sure somebody does.
[225:21.74]I do?
[225:22.08]Yeah, see?
[225:22.80]Hold on a minute.
[225:30.42]What's this shit right here?
[225:31.66]Look at that.
[225:34.96]Uh, platforming?
[225:37.32]Ah, would you look at that.
[225:44.28]Almost fell off.
[225:55.09]There's a geyser.
[225:58.47]Evil Braces!
[226:00.11]Ooh, something else over here.
[226:03.07]What's this?
[226:15.95]Don't get cocky here, because I want to see what this is.
[226:18.41]Okay, I got them all.
[226:27.40]Whoa, where am I?
[226:38.05]Oh, that's a little area that you're not supposed to find.
[226:44.72]Alright, well, cool.
[226:45.38]Anything else?
[226:46.70]Don't forget that one coin.
[226:48.10]People will scream at you.
[226:50.97]That's cool.
[226:56.41]Why is there no selfie mode?
[227:04.85]Ginger ale or riot?
[227:06.03]Oh, God.
[227:06.77]Hold on.
[227:07.19]I'm having people draw on myself right now.
[227:16.81]Alright, so here.
[227:39.81]Can I even turn this off from here?
[227:54.19]If this crashes the game, I'm gonna be very upset with you guys.
[227:56.25]Okay.
[228:02.19]See?
[228:20.66]It's off, right?
[228:21.26]Yeah.
[228:29.14]What?
[228:31.78]Save, save, save.
[228:33.02]It's alright.
[228:33.39]I don't think there's a problem.
[228:35.89]I just thought the camera was still on.
[228:38.05]Thank god it's not.
[228:45.51]We good?
[228:46.11]Did I- I didn't- Did I fucking crash it?
[228:48.19]I hope not.
[228:49.09]When was the last time I saved the game?
[228:50.70]Why did that have to happen?
[228:55.88]God damn it.
[228:57.50]Un-fucking-believable.
[229:11.66]Oh no, that's not good.
[229:13.83]Wait, hold on, hold on.
[229:15.15]It might not be crashed.
[229:25.05]It just might need a second.
[229:29.94]Hold on.
[229:44.05]Come on.
[229:45.01]It's coming back.
[229:45.57]It's got the black screen.
[229:46.41]It looks like it's trying.
[229:47.19]Come on.
[229:52.07]Come on.
[230:04.66]What have I done?
[230:35.23]I don't know how far back that save is.
[230:36.83]Because I had to alt-tab and prove that I'm not drinking alcohol.
[230:45.07]God damn it.
[230:52.97]Shh, shh, no, shh.
[231:02.25]I think my whole computer is broken.
[231:08.49]Well... Give me a fucking break.
[231:33.99]Should I skip it?
[231:35.67]I mean, we've got to watch the whole thing, right?
[231:37.73]By we, I mean you, and by you, I mean me.
[231:39.87]I'm going to try it again.
[231:48.10]Fucking come on.
[231:49.42]Really?
[231:53.18]I can't believe that.
[231:55.58]That's absolute bullshit.
[231:58.11]God damn it.
[232:01.85]And now I can't get the fucking game to launch!
[232:12.02]You gotta be kidding me.
[232:14.08]The game physically won't launch.
[232:16.18]I might have to like restart my computer.
[232:21.86]Imagine if the stream actually ended here.
[232:25.19]We would have missed all the stuff that happened in the next six hours.
[232:31.35]Damn.
[232:32.59]No, it's not in the task manager.
[232:34.03]Fuck.
[232:47.05]We were just going so well.
[232:50.36]And I had to alt-tab.
[232:59.12]I'm gonna try one more thing, and then... Oh, I'm so angry right now.
[233:07.79]Of course, I hit the fucking alt-tab button, and the whole stream has to turn off.
[233:12.42]God damn it.
[233:36.19]let's try it again
[234:11.02]That sound.
[234:15.91]You can hear it.
[234:17.01]The anger.
[234:17.85]It hadn't even started.
[234:21.77]No, it's not in the task manager.
[234:23.15]It's just, for some reason, it doesn't think I have DirectX anymore.
[234:27.06]I'm going to have to restart the computer.
[234:41.67]Which, unless I can... No.
[234:45.27]There's two?
[234:45.81]Yeah, I'm popping in every, like, couple hours.
[234:48.55]Just to see how you guys are doing.
[234:50.09]This is gonna kill the whole stream, too.
[234:52.83]Ooh, sleazy!
[234:53.91]What, throw the controller down?
[234:55.68]Place it down.
[234:57.22]Please.
[234:58.04]You got six more hours of this.
[235:02.70]Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[235:05.94]Alright.
[235:12.47]That's an end of the stream voice, I think.
[235:13.81]No, no, no.
[235:14.39]Don't change my password on... What am I doing?
[235:20.06]It might be because OBS is still running.
[235:22.08]And it's... I don't know.
[235:24.38]I'm trying to find it in the task manager and I don't see anything here.
[235:33.14]What actually happens here?
[235:34.62]I don't even remember.
[235:44.55]Did I take a picture?
[235:46.05]Did I take a picture of myself?
[235:48.19]Did I take a picture of the screen?
[235:49.25]What was that?
[235:56.85]I was enjoying that too.
[236:07.04]Mouth noise.
[236:07.82]Oh, okay.
[236:13.02]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[236:15.88]Wait, wait!
[236:30.39]Do I scream here?
[236:31.68]Yeah, I think I scream here.
[236:43.26]No?
[236:56.75]Okay, I'm fucking crazy.
[236:58.71]I thought I was opening this on my computer right now.
[237:01.63]I was like, oh, I'm playing The Simpsons.
[237:02.97]I'm out of my mind.
[237:05.09]Alright, carry on.
[237:06.17]I'll check back in a few hours, see what you guys are doing.
[237:09.19]Let's go!
[237:09.61]Let's go.
[237:17.26]Oh!
[237:17.38]This is the first mission of the game!
[237:19.71]No, it's the first- Slow down, it's okay.
[237:29.81]Shit!
[237:30.21]Alright, I'm gonna do it quick.
[237:32.80]God dammit, and a bunch of people left too because I thought it was over.
[237:35.98]So did I!
[237:36.98]Oh, come on!
[237:39.92]Quick, do everything I did really fast.
[237:49.60]Speedrun.
[237:50.72]Actually, legit speedrun.
[237:52.26]Wait.
[237:52.60]I ain't fucking around.
[237:53.22]We're getting there in five minutes.
[237:54.84]Watch this shit.
[237:55.40]Is this the beginning of the whole game?
[237:56.54]Did I play through the whole game again?
[237:58.06]I don't remember.
[237:59.06]I was about to leave until I heard that.
[238:07.23]I'm so... I'm so flustered.
[238:10.73]Oh, okay.
[238:15.61]Alright, carry on.
[238:16.21]Bye-bye.
[238:25.84]Here's the shortcut, I just missed it again!
[238:27.52]Go, go, go, go, go, quick, come on!
[238:51.16]That was a bunch of anger and rage building up in my stomach.
[239:25.99]Hit select to boost.
[239:27.45]No, I don't care.
[239:28.69]I don't care.
[239:31.17]No alt tabs.

[242:42.23]Welcome back, everybody.
[242:45.67]Sorry that, like, 500 of you left.
[242:47.53]Because I pressed the alt-tab button to put a fucking cape on my body.
[242:53.97]Maybe if I just wasn't sitting here without clothes on, I could just press the camera turn on button.
[243:07.68]Toaster road and onto the sidewalk.
[243:11.43]What's up there?
[243:22.96]Yeah, I was so dist- I was so sad!

[245:06.61]Oh, it's just a... It's one of those... One, two, three, four, five, six sided die.
[245:14.76]On three sides.
[245:20.65]I need to get this card again.

[245:31.84]Here we go.
[245:32.78]Quickly.
[245:44.02]He doesn't even need to see where he's going.
[245:50.27]Officer Jacks is on the case.
[245:54.12]Alright.
[246:13.71]We are now up to date.
[246:21.28]Camp Krusty.
[246:22.06]Ooh, what are you doing here?
[246:26.08]What's this?
[246:30.14]Can we see the beer again?
[246:31.86]I am never going to alt-tab for the rest of my life.
[246:34.01]School bus.
[246:34.51]Yeah, sure, why not?
[246:52.17]This is distracting.
[247:01.95]I don't like the lights in the back and I don't like the transparency on top.
[247:11.78]Safe!
[247:22.87]Okay.
[247:23.37]I don't know.
[247:31.53]Talk to Pooh.
[247:32.55]Hey, Pooh.
[247:33.57]Come here.
[247:34.15]I'm not going to say it again.
[247:35.79]Stop it.
[247:49.91]To meet the meat eaters.
[247:51.47]Hit and collect meat from Cletus's truck before time runs out.
[247:54.25]One, two, three, four.
[247:54.81]Get off of me.
[247:55.55]The giant crowbar just ruined everything.
[248:23.25]Give me some meat!
[248:24.91]Where is the meat?
[248:25.85]I just got silbated again.
[248:49.59]Yuck.
[248:50.66]Yucky!
[248:53.20]Does that count for me?
[248:54.62]It does.
[248:56.10]No, his cards aren't gonna explode, man.
[249:00.72]Come on!
[249:17.69]come on come on come on
[249:41.12]Oh, we got to go.
[249:42.76]I just drove on the wrong side of the road.
[249:50.76]That wasn't even my fault.
[250:21.04]Don't cut me off.
[250:32.87]Wait, I probably could have driven up, but it's okay.
[250:37.75]What just happened?
[250:40.83]That was a I died sound.
[250:50.86]Action!
[250:51.24]Dermot sounds sad.
[250:52.82]I'm alright now.
[250:54.10]I was very sad earlier.
[251:21.24]I like the saxophone That's pretty cute
[251:32.78]This is so cute.
[251:34.04]Grandpa, can you help me find Bart?
[251:36.20]He's missing.
[251:36.86]Maybe I'm just a senile old man, but Bart's lucky red hat fell out of that black car.
[251:42.14]Wow, Grandpa, what a great clue.
[251:44.61]You showed why senior citizens are valuable members of the community.
[251:48.51]I think my baby teeth are growing back.
[251:50.89]That's why I had to punch that nurse.
[251:53.13]I better use something big if I want to take that car out.
[251:57.43]Like that school bus.
[252:00.71]Destroy the black sedans to find a clue.
[252:03.06]Don't let time run out.
[252:04.14]Lisa Simpson at your service.
[252:11.50]Can't jump off that.
[252:16.16]Nope.
[252:17.96]I do get the school bus, though.
[252:21.32]Maybe a soy pop would perk me up.
[252:23.16]Good.
[252:23.62]Good.
[252:24.81]Good.
[252:42.86]I gotta go.
[252:43.84]I need speed.
[252:44.62]More speed!

[253:21.84]Why are you still alive?
[253:26.60]Oh, Lisa said it.
[253:32.58]What do I think of the movie Pixels?
[253:38.58]I didn't see the movie Pixels.
[253:40.19]Probably the Adam Sandler movie.
[253:44.03]I didn't see it.
[253:45.91]I don't have an opinion on that movie.
[253:47.89]Why would I see that movie?
[253:51.49]All for Lisa.
[253:56.81]Ow, my hair.
[254:01.71]Pac-Man is in that movie.
[254:03.07]Yeah, so is Adam Sandler.
[254:04.61]Now, that was efficient.
[254:15.60]Is that Homer?
[254:20.04]But so is Pac-Man.
[254:22.48]But so is Adam Sandler.
[254:40.64]Adam Sandler's not that bad.
[254:45.42]You know, he's just a dope You have a gift for speed great more liberal guilt What the heck were you thinking My bad I'm gonna have to do so much babysitting to pay for that

[255:17.37]Oh, no, he went over that number.
[255:19.07]I think that's funny Adam Sandler is not Nicolas Cage.
[255:40.63]What you think of the same person?
[255:45.82]Alright, I only have 25 seconds.
[255:58.77]Can you... Why?
[256:00.51]My goodness.
[256:01.75]Drive to the casino.
[256:03.58]But, there's a race over here.
[256:14.22]One of them talks like this.
[256:16.96]You know what I'm saying?
[256:19.02]Nicolas Cage talks like this.
[256:21.50]Unfortunately.
[256:22.39]No, I'm doing, I'm doing.
[256:23.57]Nick, what's his name?
[256:24.29]Nick Hoffman.
[256:25.43]The guy from Parks and Rec.
[256:29.05]Now, let me tell you.
[256:30.63]As a man, as an American, I... Hi, Nelson.
[256:39.26]This is a surprise.
[256:40.72]Oh.
[256:45.17]Yeah, Ron Swanson.
[256:45.97]That's like Nick Stevenson.
[256:47.47]Nick Offerman?
[256:48.41]What's his name?
[257:02.24]But his name is not Ron Swanson in real life.
[257:06.33]Why?
[257:06.73]I'm not getting a ha-ha right now.
[257:09.51]Don't even think about it.
[257:11.47]I'm very fragile right now.
[257:13.76]I almost just all tabbed out of the whole world.
[257:28.91]It's not haha for you, it's haha for Nelson.
[257:34.70]Why?
[257:35.00]I'm here with the school bus.
[257:37.62]For some reason.
[257:38.26]I already did this one.
[257:41.51]I already did this one.
[257:42.25]I think that this is before the alt-tab.
[257:54.00]Ohhh.
[257:54.26]I'm not gonna lose.
[258:13.41]What?
[258:13.79]Did I just?

[259:27.85]It's not even fair.
[259:43.06]I already won.
[259:43.76]This guy is doing this on purpose.
[259:48.00]What are you all doing?
[259:49.83]What are you doing?
[259:51.57]Why would you do what you just did?
[259:54.37]What are you doing?

[260:01.89]This person's not supposed to be in first place.
[260:07.41]Ever.
[260:08.21]This is not happening.
[260:12.94]She's just erratically driving around like crazy, like a phrased person.
[260:16.57]She's so mad.
[260:18.73]I gotta catch up.
[260:41.50]That was pretty good too, but you can't even control it.
[260:53.84]Yeah, I know.
[260:54.40]I understand that I am losing to the sedan AI.
[260:56.91]I know, but something really weird happened.
[261:20.91]Can we not have like a freakout moment where everybody just drives into each other and drives into me Like this person is still doing it Fucking sedan AI get out of the way
[261:53.04]So this is what it feels like to fall behind.
[261:55.94]I'm in first place, Lisa.

[262:01.02]There's so many more laps.
[262:06.72]That's like 40 laps.
[262:24.31]45 more laps.
[262:26.15]What am I gonna do about that?
[262:27.49]I'm fine.
[262:58.38]I'm about to laugh you.
[263:01.46]I gotta laugh this guy.
[263:02.44]No, I'm not gonna laugh him.
[263:08.60]I'm speechless, Lisa.
[263:10.66]That was better than you have any right to do.
[263:17.58]BM.
[263:21.80]Yeah, that was BM right there.
[263:23.12]But you can't BM Sedan AI.

[264:10.32]Thank you.
[264:23.77]Thank you.
[264:24.19]Alright, here's this mission here.
[264:26.76]Wait, don't go too fast.
[264:31.14]Walking is so PC.
[264:33.58]Alright, Chief.
[264:34.62]Excuse me, Chief Wiggum.
[264:36.10]Can you help?
[264:36.98]I've got to find my brother.
[264:38.80]Sorry, little girl.
[264:39.82]I'm busy collecting evidence on Jailbird.
[264:42.00]What is going on, Jess?
[264:44.04]How many strikes do you have so far?
[264:46.60]No strikes.
[264:47.38]But that's only because I'm a very, very bad cop.
[264:51.44]Now, first of all, if we're gonna go undercover, you will need a disguise.
[264:55.40]You mean like an eye patch?
[264:57.09]Hey, good one.
[264:58.23]If we could afford a disguise like that, I wouldn't be getting paid in potato chip coupons.
[265:02.97]So what disguise do you have?
[265:04.97]Well, here's one of Ralph's old Halloween costumes.
[265:07.39]Fine, wait here and I'll get changed.
[265:13.10]Let's meet in the middle.
[265:14.04]Show a singular toe.
[265:22.95]You need to disguise purchase Lix's cool clothes.
[265:27.14]The house is not a disguise.
[265:30.10]It's not a disguise.
[265:35.10]I won't question the value of this activity.
[265:52.82]I hate seeing the Florida, thank God.
[265:56.84]Would I buy a shirt?
[266:03.52]Somewhere over here?
[266:04.14]Can I phone in a t-shirt?
[266:08.69]Where's the t-shirt?
[266:16.35]It just told me where to go, but it didn't put a thing on my mini-map because I'm stupid.
[266:29.26]Okay.
[266:29.48]Hey, hey, hey, it's Jerma985.
[266:31.30]What I just said, I'm just going to watch it on YouTube anyways.
[266:36.20]By the way, I got a theory that some of you guys have the VOD open and you're watching 10 seconds ahead.
[266:42.85]So you know all the things and you're writing them in here before they happen.
[266:46.15]I have no idea what we're doing.
[266:47.27]Half the things I say.
[266:49.47]Like some of you guys are just like 10 seconds ahead just writing everything in the chat before it appears on the stream.
[266:57.79]Quit spoiling it for all the new people!
[266:59.57]Never mind.
[267:05.89]I thought there was something up there.
[267:11.60]Sorry, this is a real boring part of the stream anyways.
[267:16.72]Now that was kind of intense, but you know.
[267:18.72]Comic book!
[267:19.46]Comic book!
[267:20.12]Comic book!
[267:24.52]That's not spoiling.
[267:25.22]That's reenacting.
[267:26.00]Comic books.
[267:27.06]Okay, so if I turn this on right now and I reenact the end of Game of Thrones... No, that says coffee books.
[267:31.78]Is that not a spoiler?
[267:32.86]That says cafe books.
[267:33.52]I thought it said comic books.
[267:34.33]No, no, you don't understand.
[267:35.11]It's a reenactment.
[267:35.89]I have a Khaleesi wig on.
[267:37.43]What the hell are you talking about?
[267:40.03]No, you see, it's different.
[267:40.93]I'm wearing a Dora Warman mask.
[267:41.91]This is the worst town in America.
[267:51.64]Let me recite my favorite Varys scene.
[267:54.69]No, that's not a spoiler books cafe.
[267:59.68]Alright, bye Whatever I Know what's right there.
[268:21.67]I was trying to get there's a card on top.
[268:22.93]Oh

[269:08.79]Ooh.
[269:10.87]Alright.

[274:08.24]Did I just do a handstand?
[274:13.12]Sweet, forward momentum.
[274:22.41]Oh, I could go for it.
[274:23.27]I could go for just some dogshit buffet chicken nuggets.
[274:29.50]You know when you go over to the chicken nugget buffet?
[274:33.88]There's like 400 chicken nuggets there, and you just load it up.
[274:36.50]You just keep putting them on the plate.
[274:38.97]You don't even give a shit.
[274:44.50]And sometimes there's just a random vegetable there.
[274:48.24]Blow it up on asparagus.
[274:49.90]Who's this person?
[274:51.12]Who's this random dude?
[275:16.24]Who is that random seahorse?
[275:18.60]Lisa Simpson at your service.
[275:20.30]What are you doing?
[275:23.30]Get out of here.
[275:23.94]Trying to get in the car.
[275:29.98]Call me Pio.
[275:32.50]One fish delivered to a happy home.
[275:36.48]Oh, I get to take a fish.
[275:38.63]OK.
[275:52.08]You missed seven.
[275:53.66]No I didn't.
[276:19.61]I have fish delivered to a happy home.
[276:23.09]Have a good life.
[276:30.00]I hope these are recyclable.
[276:38.13]How?
[276:38.79]Mm, smell that fresh air.
[276:49.36]The time for action is now.
[276:52.58]One fish delivered to a happy home.
[276:55.98]Have a good life.
[277:03.09]I got it, and it didn't even do anything for me.
[277:05.87]Plenty of good living here.
[277:08.43]Oh, the guilt.
[277:11.27]Now you'll never be fried in sauce.
[277:19.26]Ooh, at the, mmm, buffet.
[277:22.00]They have, like, fish sticks there.
[277:24.52]Sometimes I got some fish there.
[277:33.62]That turned way faster than I thought it was.
[277:47.64]Fish sticks at a buffet?
[277:48.66]Sometimes, yeah.
[277:49.22]They get, like, fried cod.
[277:51.34]Not necessarily fish sticks, but... Fried... Fish sticks.
[278:07.87]I know what that is.
[278:24.11]I might not get it.
[278:30.27]Why did I even turn?
[278:31.65]I look at chat and I see somebody says, Jerma, you seem off today.
[278:36.44]Just hurry up.
[278:37.34]I'm going to be tired.
[278:43.18]Now maybe that two-bit Ahab will tell me what he knows.
[278:46.96]You seem off today.
[278:48.40]No, I'm just having fun, man.
[278:50.68]I'd move if I were you.
[278:59.40]I already got that.
[279:00.42]Yeah, I got that interaction, right?
[279:15.16]Chat seems more off than Jerma does.
[279:25.57]Yeah, what's going on?
[279:26.83]What's wrong with you guys right now?
[279:28.07]What happened?
[279:28.81]What's going on here?
[279:36.90]I guess I have to go down there.
[279:54.25]I'm here watching the world's worst gamer.
[279:58.00]I don't think that's true.
[280:00.84]I think you're just saying that.
[280:02.72]I don't think that's true.
[280:07.34]This kid's still here.
[280:27.06]Thanks for delivering me catch of the day.
[280:29.56]Now, I can tell ye, I saw your brother.
[280:33.40]Really?
[280:34.14]That's great.
[280:35.35]Aye, he was in a long black limo, and ahoy, thar she drove.
[280:41.31]Took me hours to finish this when I was young.
[280:45.55]Get her to the black limo to find Bart.
[280:47.29]Let's just do this thing.
[280:50.14]I have need for speed, car speed.
[280:56.48]Uh, doesn't seem like the right car for this.
[280:58.48]Into the water?
[280:59.94]How did you just turn that around, Elvin?
[281:24.29]Into the water!
[281:24.97]Get into the water!
[281:28.18]I'm losing this fight.
[281:34.08]What kind of limo is this?
[281:42.45]Strongest damn limo I've ever seen.
[281:51.53]Dropping frames.
[281:54.59]Oh, crap.
[281:56.09]It's alright.
[281:57.89]It'll pass.
[282:04.99]Usually does.
[282:05.69]My car is gonna blow up before this does.
[282:22.61]Give me that wrench.
[282:23.73]I'm only halfway there.
[282:25.47]How am I gonna do this?
[282:27.33]I need another car for this.
[282:33.25]That was full speed.
[282:34.67]I'm gonna push you into a wall or something.
[282:45.44]Drive him into the wall!
[282:46.74]Into the wall!
[282:47.86]Into the wall!
[282:52.09]If I see a phone I'm getting out
[283:27.30]There we go.
[283:27.76]I need speed!
[283:29.14]More speed!
[283:29.94]How are you on top of my car?
[283:34.94]Yeah, I'll be alright though.
[283:35.86]I'm good, I'm good.
[283:36.50]I don't need a problem.
[283:41.24]You have to drive him into the walls.
[283:44.54]Like this.
[283:44.88]You have to stay behind him.
[283:46.41]Yeah, there we go.
[283:50.57]Just keep the momentum behind him and he will drive into walls.
[283:57.52]See?
[283:58.20]Lisa knows what I'm talking about.
[284:02.04]One more.
[284:07.99]Right into the wall.
[284:16.29]Into the wall.
[284:20.01]Come on.
[284:24.96]Right there, bang.
[284:26.48]That's not enough.
[284:38.25]Drive into something!
[284:40.47]Drive into something.
[284:49.27]I'm being towed!
[284:51.29]Ah!
[285:10.00]You have an idea how hard that was to keep that up?
[285:13.72]Alright, let's see.
[285:28.95]Captain?
[285:30.69]Went down the wrong tube.
[285:32.41]Sorry.
[285:33.25]Alright.
[285:36.59]Punch it.
[285:47.60]He ate his pant?
[285:49.66]He ate his pant.
[285:52.74]Alright.
[285:56.24]What's next?
[285:56.74]Oh, god.
[285:57.46]I destroyed the limo and killed Bart.
[286:02.59]No, murderer EB.
[286:04.31]He wasn't in the limo.
[286:05.93]He got out and he boarded that ship.
[286:08.31]Can you take me there?
[286:09.77]Nah, I hate the sea.
[286:18.72]What are you doing?
[286:19.21]Get out of the way.
[286:42.03]It's timed!
[286:43.65]Oh no!
[286:45.19]What?
[286:46.25]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[286:48.01]I was just... Okay, I'm good.
[286:50.45]What happened?
[286:50.93]Did I get Bard?
[286:51.49]Did I find Bard?
[286:53.20]I found him.
[286:55.22]Holy shit.
[287:03.80]Alright, I found Bard.
[287:07.57]It's fine.
[287:10.43]What?
[287:16.38]What's going, what, where's Bart?
[287:19.05]Where does this want me to go, in the boat?
[287:41.58]The arrow stops here.
[287:43.21]I gotta go to the other side?
[287:44.39]Can I make this jump?
[287:55.29]There's a ramp?
[287:57.66]Did I miss the ramp on the other side?
[287:58.88]This is the worst town in America.
[288:07.38]Hey!
[288:08.54]Eyes on the road, jerk!
[288:14.54]Where is this thing?
[288:16.73]There it is.
[288:17.45]Bart!
[288:20.09]Bart!
[288:20.53]Bart!
[288:43.24]This reminds me of when I was a little girl.
[288:47.09]Looks like I'm not at 58%... Hello, Springfield!
[288:53.89]Darn it!
[288:56.51]Oh no, this is not good.
[289:01.07]Where was the ramp on the other side?
[289:02.45]I just, I drove around in a circle.
[289:04.65]Did I, I missed it when I was on the way up?
[289:07.65]Oh, goddammit.
[289:09.03]How'd you like the newspaper upside your head?
[289:14.20]You know what like this for the love of god Um, um, I seem to be stranded here, can you help my sister out?
[289:37.06]The time for action is now let me do this in five seconds
[289:46.85]Sweet forward momentum.
[289:49.47]Ow, my hair.
[289:51.24]Or not.
[289:51.50]Look out.
[289:51.84]You just have 500,000 health.
[289:54.38]Ow, my hair.
[289:54.86]Time to move.
[290:17.62]Right into the wall.
[290:24.47]Sorry, sorry.
[290:28.47]Crash.
[290:33.19]I hope those were recyclable.
[290:47.47]They made this way too tough to kill this thing.
[290:54.10]It just has too much health.
[291:04.76]A child could do this?
[291:05.86]No, no, no, no!
[291:06.78]Remember the person in chat that said this mission took them like seven hours?
[291:13.97]No, this is not a...
[291:17.30]Get out of the way.
[291:24.41]No, and I'm looking at fucking chat.
[291:29.33]Yeah, as a chat.
[291:30.33]Do you know how hard these old fucking games from like the 2000, 1998 era are?
[291:38.54]They're so hard.
[291:40.22]They're incredibly hard.
[291:42.00]They're difficult video games.
[291:47.69]Go load up Donkey Kong Country!
[291:49.91]I guarantee you rage quit after the first world.
[292:05.58]Alright, so where's this jump?
[292:11.00]If I follow the... arrows here.
[292:15.18]The arrows are pointing me to go this way.
[292:17.10]Why?
[292:17.92]But then they stop.
[292:28.34]Why would the arrows tell me to go this way if I don't have to go this way?
[292:40.72]That doesn't make... Why are they on the ground there?
[292:46.57]Was I actually in the right spot last time?
[292:48.61]Like in here?
[292:57.43]Just hold on.
[292:58.11]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[292:59.13]Hold on a second.
[293:00.29]So do not follow the arrows on the ground, which for the entire, entire video game, it points you in the right direction to where you're supposed to drive.
[293:22.49]wait wait wait wait right there I just I don't see it I'm serious like over here where is this I know it's right there but how do I get in there
[293:45.66]Just drive this way.
[293:48.16]Oh my fucking god.
[293:49.82]Well, it's not even pointing me in the right direction The arrows didn't even remotely go this way I can do it
[294:11.20]Oh my fucking God, no!
[294:13.54]No, God!
[294:14.70]I can do it with a jump!
[294:17.62]Bart!
[294:22.02]Where is he?
[294:23.61]Bart!
[294:27.81]He didn't tell me to go, whatever.
[295:13.80]They didn't that I know I did that jump before but the arrows to get there weren't point I thought I had to go a different way Why wouldn't the arrows point like to go over the ramp?
[295:25.37]oh alright I get to be marge now wait let me play with the TV of a prisoner named skateboarding glory
[295:55.53]What is wrong with Bart?
[295:56.53]Yeah, something's wrong with his... I think the game might be fucked up.
[295:59.81]Do you hear him?
[296:23.45]He's like, blah, blah, blah.
[296:24.27]I think the audio fucked up.
[296:29.81]Everyone better stay out of my way.
[296:37.49]Oh, my goodness.

[297:27.83]Alright, I did it.
[297:33.01]Now I gotta talk to you.
[297:34.79]Chief Wiggum, I need you to find out what happened to Bart.
[297:38.08]Could you show me where the crop circle is?
[297:40.94]There's got to be a clue to curing Bart.
[297:44.38]Ah, that's cute.
[297:45.58]I'd love to help, but I got sugar withdrawal real bad.
[297:48.62]The donut store is closed, and I got a monkey on my back screaming for Cruller.
[297:53.59]Oh, oh, he's screaming.
[297:57.99]Oh.
[297:58.65]God.

[299:38.93]Oh my goodness!
[299:43.83]Oh.
[299:46.87]How's that for a turn, though?
[300:07.44]No, I didn't want the camera to change.
[300:08.86]I wanted to be able to see where I was going.
[300:15.90]Oh, no.
[300:18.77]Oh, man.
[300:33.13]Oh, man.
[300:35.81]Oh, man.
[300:37.49]Oh, get... Alright.
[300:39.93]My whole body just almost exploded.
[300:44.44]I want a new costume for March.
[301:06.76]I had one for Homer.
[301:08.66]I had one for Lisa.
[301:09.92]I had two for Lisa.
[301:11.40]Let me take a look.
[301:23.13]I need some money.
[301:23.91]I need money.
[301:24.67]I need like 300, 400, 500.
[301:26.25]Something like that.
[301:29.05]What is her attack?
[301:32.55]You want to know what the best Simpsons video game ever made is?
[301:38.96]And I kind of wish I could play it.
[301:39.96]I wonder if there's a way to play it.
[301:41.92]The... Remember The Simpsons arcade game?
[301:48.78]That game was amazing.
[301:53.30]The beat-em-up?
[301:56.39]That was probably the best Simpsons video game ever.
[302:00.25]What about that side?
[302:03.77]Is there a card?
[302:04.61]There's a card over there.
[302:08.69]I wonder if I can make it from here.
[302:12.17]Not really.
[302:12.61]This is going to be a tough jump.
[302:17.69]Didn't even... Whatever.
[302:18.69]Goodbye.
[302:23.61]There's a version of a 360?
[302:24.61]Is there really?
[302:25.47]That's actually awesome.
[302:31.86]Alright.
[302:32.18]Inmate Marge.
[302:34.34]Classy Marge.
[302:35.26]Or Police Marge.
[302:37.68]I only have 300 coins.
[302:38.60]I need 400 for Police Marge.
[302:53.57]Not enough.
[302:55.51]I'll save it.
[302:59.03]Speaking of saving it...
[303:12.04]Alright.
[303:14.72]So... I can start collecting money.
[303:27.03]Save Milhouse.
[303:34.48]Save Milhouse.
[303:35.36]Kill Milhouse.
[303:36.42]Why would you want me to do something like that?
[303:38.44]Milhouse is a great, great young lad.
[304:01.40]There is a race available.
[304:02.46]I didn't do the other ones, but I need to do the three races.
[304:06.10]I have to.
[304:06.54]What is that car?
[304:27.12]Alright, do I get that for doing the three races?
[304:30.48]How am I ever going to compete with this?
[304:36.64]Oh.
[304:38.20]Like that, apparently.
[304:40.26]Uh... I was going too fast.
[304:50.53]The SUV, you can't turn it very well.
[304:56.13]If I do that again, I might be able to do it.
[305:01.47]This is not the right car for this.
[305:07.15]No.
[305:07.45]Mm-mm.
[305:08.63]Not gonna happen.
[305:27.63]Clown car.
[305:33.10]There's a lot of cars, huh?
[305:37.94]Sedan is probably the best one.
[305:39.74]Or Lisa's car.
[305:41.18]And Lisa's gonna drive.
[305:59.63]How do you get the clown car?
[306:02.71]We were promised a clown car.
[306:08.96]Well, how do I unlock it?
[306:15.34]You gotta buy it.
[306:16.86]How much is it?
[306:29.18]It's not 9-9-9-9-9.
[306:34.62]He's still playing this?
[306:35.60]Yeah.
[306:36.76]I'm probably going to complete it tonight.
[306:41.42]I can't start Simpsons Hit and Run and not finish it.
[306:46.91]He thinks he's gonna do it It's a minimum of 11 hours
[307:13.34]Well... Is it?
[307:13.80]Alright, straight through.
[307:15.08]I don't want to go too fast, because... Whoops.
[307:35.79]That's why, but I'm the first still.
[307:38.71]Alright, now stay in first.
[307:40.85]Holy shit, this car is so fast.
[307:42.55]How am I going to keep in front of you?
[307:46.83]What?
[307:48.18]Marge!
[308:01.94]You went over that, and it turned out it was a bad idea.
[308:07.96]I gotta hit every one of these, like, secret jumps.
[308:16.03]I'm not ready for this one.
[308:25.45]That car's too good.
[308:27.69]I need the clown car before I can come back.
[308:35.42]Try it one more time.
[308:36.18]I have to beat all these to get the clown car.
[308:49.18]Uh, Rotten Fresh just gave $50.
[308:51.36]Hey, Jerm, I just got a job.
[308:52.42]Wanted to give back.

[309:00.15]Thank you so much, Rotten, for your $50.
[309:03.93]Your huge $50.
[309:04.90]Thank you.
[309:05.50]That means a lot.

[310:01.68]How much more I can just sit down?
[310:08.13]That doesn't really do anything for me.
[310:09.29]I feel like I shouldn't even do that one.
[310:10.61]You're just so much faster than me.
[310:16.97]Ooh.
[310:17.33]You screwed up, though.
[310:34.74]He can go over that grass better than I can.
[310:38.95]No, no.
[310:56.53]No, I think I need a better car.
[310:59.85]I think I need to come in with a faster or better handling car.
[311:02.27]There's so many twists and turns and... That car is just twice as fast as mine.
[311:15.50]Gonna take more shortcuts?
[311:16.40]Well, I have to memorize where the shortcuts are and that is not gonna happen.
[311:24.26]I can guarantee you that.
[311:29.83]I hope these aren't recyclable.
[311:32.95]This is so humiliating.
[311:35.26]You won't like me when I'm angry.
[311:42.68]What a letdown.
[311:44.18]Come on.
[311:46.48]Smashy, smashy!
[311:50.98]I never underachieve at anything.
[311:52.90]Is this going to affect my insurance?
[311:56.18]We both just- Holy shit, he fucked it all up.
[311:59.17]Come on.
[311:59.85]Pay attention.
[312:00.35]No!
[312:16.35]He went over the thing, whatever, the giant thing.
[312:18.59]I don't know what it was.
[312:19.45]He's doing every single, you have to hit every single shortcut.
[312:22.50]I just don't know where they are.
[312:23.56]Ah, god damn it.
[312:26.66]You have to hit every single shortcut.
[312:30.50]I had it.
[312:31.19]I don't even know what I fucking hit there.
[312:34.25]No.
[312:35.03]He's taking all the shortcuts.
[312:50.85]It's not even a race!
[312:53.32]It's just cheating!
[312:55.38]This is not a race, this is who can cheat better!
[312:58.58]Which one of you two can take the cheat codes better?
[313:06.55]Shazbot!
[313:09.09]Great!
[313:09.83]More liberal guilt!
[313:11.33]Send the bill to Homer!
[313:20.94]No, I'm done.
[313:24.37]No thanks.
[313:25.31]No thanks.
[313:26.61]No, no thank you.
[313:28.11]Nope.
[313:54.77]Sorry about that.
[314:13.90]Mr. Guy, what are you doing here?
[314:16.32]Well, I've been trying to convince Agnes to come make fun of schoolchildren, but she refuses to go out with me.
[314:22.09]That son of hers keeps intercepting every gift I send her and hides them at his workplace.
[314:27.11]He's a jerk and a fool.
[314:28.72]Why not just go get them back?
[314:30.50]I would, but... Well, I'm not a terribly mobile person.
[314:34.52]There, I said it.
[314:36.06]Oh, I know.
[314:37.36]It's not easy being husky.
[314:40.20]I know, hold on, just give me a second.
[314:42.67]Wait till the cutscene's over.
[314:44.05]What the fuck is going on in here?
[314:45.27]What's going on in here?
[314:46.21]I have to alt-tab.
[314:46.95]Save the goddamn game.
[314:47.63]I got pinged.
[314:48.01]I was in the bath.
[315:13.99]Oh, okay, okay.
[315:14.67]I thought the stream turned off.
[315:17.41]Alright, it's saved.
[315:18.55]I heard, Jerma, Jerma, please, Jerma, please, please, Jerma, please, Jerma, please, please, please.
[315:22.03]I was like, oh, the stream must be off.
[315:23.55]I was in a goddamn bath.
[315:24.81]I don't know why my stream labs is minimized.
[315:28.99]I don't know why the hell that happened.
[315:30.21]Well, he sounds really mad.
[315:31.66]He sounds deflated.
[315:32.80]It's actually gone.
[315:33.50]This guy sucks.
[315:41.90]That's weird.
[315:51.17]Did I like X out of the window?
[315:52.55]No, I had it up.
[315:54.31]That's very weird.
[316:00.62]Alright.
[316:02.16]Now I can see.
[316:11.42]So we had huge money.
[316:17.49]We had $50 from Lightning Rider.
[316:19.51]You can be here.
[316:20.13]I believe in you.
[316:20.77]I'm sorry that that's not true.
[316:24.13]Thank you so much for the $50.
[316:24.95]I wasn't going to spend the next two hours trying to do that.
[316:32.40]Sometimes you've got to accept when you can't do something.
[316:36.62]I'd rather just enjoy the game.
[316:38.40]Who's holding the fucking horn down?
[316:42.70]Okay, apparently I was.
[316:45.76]It's a blank screen.
[316:47.80]Shouldn't be.
[317:04.59]Why are you doing this now?
[317:09.27]I think I'm going to have to restart the game.
[317:11.44]Yes, I am.
[317:22.59]Let's try it again.
[317:29.25]Okay, come on back.
[317:55.14]I had it saved right there, so we're fine.
[317:56.60]Resume game.
[317:59.46]But no, Lightning Rider, thank you so much.
[318:00.96]50 fucking dollars, and then... There were 20 community subs.
[318:10.93]From... How long ago was that?
[318:14.54]Was that from Great Canadian?
[318:27.33]But that's $50 as well.
[318:28.89]So, thank you so much, guys.
[318:30.83]There's been, like, three or four $50 donations.
[318:32.94]And then, like, a bunch of subs, too.
[318:51.35]Thank you.
[318:51.73]I'm gonna pop in here as a real, as current, uh, current President Jerma.
[318:56.29]Uh, just wait till the sorcery stream.
[318:58.13]Uh, I wasn't paying any attention to that.
[319:00.11]Sorcery stream as subs, shoutouts.
[319:03.29]You guys are gonna be really fucking confused.
[319:09.91]What the hell is going on in this game?
[319:15.88]Who is real?
[319:17.60]Well, I'm popping in from time to time.
[319:19.00]I have to, I have to chill out though.
[319:21.28]Keep coming in here and going like, look at me!
[319:23.46]Look at me!
[319:24.62]I gotta stop doing that.
[319:27.86]What?
[319:29.54]I'm talking.
[319:30.06]What?
[319:31.32]He's talking to me?
[319:31.90]I'm gonna lose him.
[319:36.16]Bye.
[319:38.64]Oh, man.
[319:39.04]It's getting close for me to break my controller in half.
[319:43.53]Good time to leave.
[319:44.33]I don't want to see this shit.
[319:46.19]Come on!
[319:48.59]Break it!
[319:50.23]There it goes!
[319:52.24]Oh, I did it!
[319:59.94]I made a switch control, are you serious?
[320:03.75]Comfy, pretty comfy.
[320:11.39]Oh, I just had that thing done.
[320:26.70]Alright.
[320:33.90]Can you drop another one?
[320:48.38]Or do I have to ram ya?
[320:53.36]Why would I bring the biggest car in here?
[321:06.75]I regret nothing.
[321:16.13]Where are you going?
[321:16.87]No, don't go down.
[321:18.77]Ooh, polygons.
[321:29.31]I'm on two wheels.
[321:36.19]Ten more community subs!
[321:40.09]From 64Fanatic, thank you.
[321:45.03]Another big drop.
[321:47.52]Speaking of big drops, can you drop the last item?
[321:51.70]Thank you so much, 64.
[321:52.24]Thank you, GreatCanadian, for your 20.
[321:54.62]Thanks a lot, guys.
[321:57.84]Remember four hours ago when you said you wouldn't get mad at this game?
[322:04.69]Well, there was a lot of factors involved.
[322:11.83]There's like four factors.
[322:18.07]It's not just the video game.
[322:27.05]I just have to pee.
[322:28.72]So I'll pee again.
[322:32.48]Who can get mad at The Simpsons?
[322:35.75]No, I'm at it like my computer.
[322:38.21]That was like the alt tab bullshit from like an hour ago.
[322:40.67]That's what started the whole thing.
[322:42.99]I was fine.
[322:48.43]I gotta pee.
[322:49.13]I'll be right back.
[322:56.19]I will be right back.
[323:12.38]Eh?
[325:39.82]Hello.
[325:40.02]Alright, where we going?
[325:55.51]That guy looks like a cat.
[325:56.39]Don't get your clothes dirty.
[325:58.11]Oh.
[325:58.17]I have to buy those?
[326:24.74]Do I have to buy them?
[326:25.42]I don't have... I need more money.
[326:31.82]I don't want this car.
[326:46.82]I hate this car.
[326:49.38]I want a card that I don't hate.
[326:50.50]How about this one?
[326:52.06]I need more step aerobics classes.
[326:58.62]Junk it.
[327:00.16]Junk that one.
[327:09.01]Hmm.
[327:13.55]Hook me up with some wheels, man.
[327:15.79]Can do.
[327:20.30]Lisa, why do you have to hold the horn down when I get in every time?
[327:28.43]Alright, I need to go to the, uh... Change my clothes, which is literally right in front of me.
[327:40.84]Is this mission money, or do I have to pay for this?
[327:45.55]I have to pay for this, don't I?
[327:50.84]I don't want to pay for this.
[327:51.66]Shit!
[327:56.24]It sticks to the gun!
[328:03.27]It's the first gun I've seen all game.
[328:15.94]Where to next, video game?
[328:17.40]Despite my age, I am driving here.
[328:27.18]Game save.
[328:27.76]Let's go.
[328:36.27]Oh, no, no.
[328:37.23]I want to use that car.
[328:38.51]Oh, bye, Lisa.
[328:40.09]Harvest ketchup packets for the winter.
[328:41.59]Don't let time run out.
[328:42.61]I'll do my best.
[328:45.49]Oh, God.
[328:46.19]I have two minutes to get 18?
[328:50.33]We need them ketchup packets people done throwed out to feed on during the long winter.
[328:58.42]Help me fetch them.
[329:00.14]Whatever just happened was none of my business.
[329:02.54]Thank God I got it.
[329:03.44]I figured that out in a quarter of a second.
[329:06.26]I could feed it in my stank bone.
[329:13.97]Help me fetch them.
[329:15.03]You better run.
[329:18.78]Oh, I could have made a good septic system out of that.
[329:21.82]Move it, land cow.
[329:26.36]Alright.
[329:26.64]Hold on.
[329:27.04]Hold on.
[329:28.26]Oh.
[329:31.48]Shit.
[329:33.26]What is going on with the grass?
[329:35.30]Fix the grass.
[329:36.20]Fix the grass.
[329:39.89]I don't understand what happened here.
[329:42.75]I don't even know what I did.
[329:50.95]I don't fucking know what happened.
[329:55.39]Oh, I see another one.
[329:59.61]It's still possible.
[330:00.39]It's still possible.
[330:03.04]Don't worry.
[330:17.09]Remember these shortcuts.
[330:18.67]Oh, I'm not gonna... There's a lot of shit down here.
[330:23.43]Where is this last one?
[330:25.83]Um, is it... Where is it?
[330:29.55]Is it up?
[330:47.22]It's up.
[330:49.48]OK.
[330:51.83]What?
[330:54.31]I'll do my best.
[330:55.45]I don't understand.
[331:01.13]Why was it above me?
[331:03.31]Have to go off a ramp?
[331:04.69]We need them ketchup packets people done throwed out to feed on during the long winter.
[331:10.17]Help me fetch them.
[331:11.45]That's not very nice.
[331:13.57]Hey, I know another dumpster's round here somewheres.
[331:17.04]I can feed it in my stank bone.
[331:29.52]Don't crash into it.
[331:30.38]This handling feels like shit, and I'm not the one playing.
[331:35.78]Well, this car is.
[331:36.98]That part right there is... Oh, my God.
[331:59.44]See, before I did this mission, I looked over in the chat and I saw somebody say, I hate this mission.
[332:03.20]Now I think I... I was like, well, I wonder why.
[332:15.52]I'm just reading.
[332:16.14]I need to start over.
[332:32.28]I can drive 55.
[332:33.36]We need them ketchup packets people done throwed out to feed on during the long winter.
[332:43.87]Help me fetch them.
[332:46.13]Why are you making a second system out of ketchup?
[332:47.65]Yeah, I know another dumpster's around here somewheres.
[332:50.39]That's not alright.
[332:51.33]There's nothing even in ki- what?
[332:53.00]Is it the vinegar that's in there?
[332:54.84]Oh, that looked expensive.
[333:11.63]Weave the needle.
[333:12.89]Ugh.
[333:15.87]Alright, this is the part that gets me every time.
[333:18.35]This little spot.
[333:21.58]I'm not sure there's a clean way to do that.
[333:24.30]Okay, right here.
[333:35.09]Oh, that was sloppy.
[333:37.71]Thank God it's okay, though.
[333:46.16]Alright, now, so I- I was supposed to just drive around and go over a ramp or something?
[333:50.20]Am I supposed to- which way am I supposed to go?
[333:57.04]Down here?
[334:08.78]And then what, a round?
[334:09.70]Boy, oh, I got 40 seconds to get out of here.
[334:14.40]Oh, man.
[334:16.04]Okay.
[334:17.94]Please don't make me... How do I... Thank God.
[334:20.65]Get away from the sedan.
[334:43.30]That one was not good.
[334:52.95]Do it!
[334:53.41]I'm very disappointed in you.
[335:02.91]Don't worry, you got teleported, Marge.
[335:04.81]Excellent work.
[335:06.22]Heck, I'm gonna sneeze.
[335:08.44]I'm sorry.
[335:08.68]In advance, I'll get it.
[335:09.34]Okay.

[336:16.19]Well, a clown car is a clown car is a clown car.
[336:18.65]It is.
[336:19.11]A clown car is a clown car.
[336:20.79]It's a clown car.
[336:23.91]When you have one clown car and another clown car next to a clown car, they're all clown cars.
[336:32.03]Who needs a clown car when you have this?
[336:44.91]This is my new car.
[336:45.89]Forever.
[336:52.80]Can I save this in a garage somewhere?
[337:00.50]Alright, Mole Man.
[337:08.88]What do you need?
[337:13.50]I'm hiding from the police.
[337:15.30]If the police find me out past curfew, they'll throw me in jail.
[337:18.66]Race with that thing?
[337:21.20]Well, I was wondering if you've ever seen a crop circle.
[337:25.50]Talk to Abe.
[337:26.98]He mentioned crop circles once.
[337:29.30]Hurry up and get to the home before the police lock the doors.

[338:00.09]This thing's actually kind of making me free.
[338:01.82]This is, like, hurting my brain.
[338:06.78]When I turn, the whole world... It's like Mario Kart, man.
[338:09.59]This, like, hurts my head.
[338:10.59]I don't know.
[338:12.07]What the fuck?
[338:15.35]Ah.
[338:20.96]Marge Simpson, at your service.
[338:23.06]Alright, this thing's cool, but... Can I drive this car insane?
[338:26.02]It's like old-school Mario Kart.
[338:28.14]And the whole world spins when you turn the car.
[338:31.96]Oh, my.
[338:33.14]Really?
[338:33.42]You shouldn't enjoy that.
[338:36.78]Okay.
[338:37.30]Maybe I shouldn't pick this thing.
[338:43.08]I'll do my best.
[338:44.00]I'll try this one more time.
[338:46.57]Let's do this thing.

[340:40.52]What?
[340:41.28]Huh?
[340:41.92]I can't tell you about crop circles right now.
[340:43.88]Those lousy renegades stole my pills.
[340:46.25]Without my agri-leave, I'll start fighting nurses.
[340:49.15]You don't need the lawsuit.

[341:38.45]Like, alright.
[341:46.08]That moon is massive.
[341:54.43]It's pretty big, isn't it?
[342:04.41]Uh, I probably could have gone off- yeah, I could have gone off that.
[342:14.70]Oh, I don't have any pockets.

[343:09.18]What?
[343:20.36]Are you?
[343:20.96]Okay.
[343:25.78]I'm hitting the corner, apparently, somehow.
[343:37.73]Alright, like, I'm sorry.
[343:41.01]I'm sorry, but, like, follow the guy while he drops items for the 50th damn time.
[343:48.07]I, like, come on.
[343:51.58]What the hell?
[343:59.63]I'm gonna lose.
[344:16.27]I'll do my best.
[344:18.25]You just realized you've been doing the same four missions the whole game?
[344:21.67]I think I just realized that right now.
[344:26.17]Am I actually just coming to that realization right now?
[344:44.98]Oh my goodness, that was so fast!
[344:52.88]Let's try it again.
[344:54.02]The music's driving me insane.
[345:07.45]Give me that money.
[345:09.36]Actually, it is.
[345:12.22]It's quite a lot of money.
[345:14.82]Easy, Marge.
[345:24.56]Alright, let's do it
[346:00.46]He did the same thing.
[346:01.50]Which way did he do it?
[346:19.33]Down here?

[346:59.08]Hold on.
[346:59.68]Oh, and I have another timer.

[352:04.96]Robast, thanks for the raid.
[352:07.40]I'm sitting here fucking playing.
[352:08.96]And I just saw that I heard there was a raid.
[352:10.84]I ran over here.
[352:14.94]Thanks for the raid.
[352:16.46]He's melting down.
[352:18.06]No, I'm not melting down.
[352:19.38]I'm alright.
[352:20.14]Listen.
[352:20.62]I had a couple of, like, moments where you go, What the fuck?
[352:26.18]Oh, no!
[352:27.12]Yes, alright.
[352:27.82]So, anyways, hi.
[352:28.72]This is a re- This is a rerun.
[352:32.84]I hope you know.
[352:34.40]I wanted to make sure we were clear about this.
[352:36.10]This is a rerun.
[352:39.28]I'm not live right now.
[352:40.78]I am, but I'm not.
[352:41.74]I'm currently over here in the bath.
[352:43.72]I'm trying to take it easy because I'm on medical leave.
[352:48.85]Okay, so just want to make sure.
[352:50.95]I saw that I got a raid.
[352:53.52]I'm just like, oh, I got to get over there.
[352:58.44]I take long baths, okay?
[353:03.03]Been in there for four hours.
[353:04.51]Oh, I can't believe it.
[353:12.56]Good grief.
[353:13.46]Alright, but thank you, Robast.
[353:15.52]Seriously, welcome everybody to a rerun.
[353:20.11]Good night.
[353:20.71]Goodbye.
[353:22.03]Thank you.
[353:23.85]What?
[353:26.09]I'm not gonna help.
[353:48.16]Oh, he's freaking out.
[353:48.88]He's freaking out.
[353:53.74]Clown car time.
[353:54.85]Not yet.
[353:59.17]What a fucking psycho.
[354:00.77]No, come on.
[354:01.85]Give me a little bit of credit here.
[354:04.59]I'm playing an old 2000s game that's very hard, that's considered one of the hardest video games of the last century.
[354:11.70]And I'm talking, yeah, back when fucking Sottles Tease, whatever his name was, the guy, the Caesar, was putting people inside of a fucking dome and making them fight each other.
[354:21.89]I'm talking harder than that.
[354:22.99]Dude, you seriously suck at this game.
[354:27.37]Do something easier.
[354:39.75]I have 2,000 hours in this game.
[354:40.87]Serve and protect.
[354:41.79]Purchase Marge's police uniform at the Quickie Mart's room or... I mean, there it is.
[354:45.55]I don't have enough.
[355:13.91]Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
[355:17.53]I'm going!
[355:19.71]There's no bathroom in here.
[355:22.33]Why is everybody yelling bathroom?
[355:35.78]Enough?
[355:36.44]No.
[355:37.66]I have to steal money from fucking Flanders.
[355:42.19]Hold L and R and press A, B. I'm not cheating.
[355:44.69]No, I'm beating this game.
[355:46.99]Legitimate money.
[355:48.97]Everybody thought I was lying.
[355:53.89]Look at how burpy and gassy I am.
[355:57.43]I am still here.
[355:58.07]I was just seeing what you guys were saying.
[356:00.51]I got enough money.
[356:01.91]I'm good to go.
[356:07.38]Jerma, I have over 2,000 sucks at this game.
[356:09.84]Why did I just read that?
[356:20.81]There's no reason for me to read what you just said.
[356:30.96]Look at your new outfit in the window.
[356:35.10]Run and collect all the evil Cola cans before time runs out.
[356:42.13]What?
[356:42.31]You mean out here?
[356:43.15]Is Marge on drugs?
[357:11.63]Should I be... I have to be walking, right?
[357:20.68]How am I... How would I ever do this without... Go all... Cones!
[357:29.51]Get the coins.
[357:33.43]Did I miss any?
[357:36.23]I think I missed two.
[357:39.39]Where are these?
[357:40.89]Wait, is it- I can go- I can get them around, right?
[357:46.93]Get it!
[357:47.19]I don't- oh my god.
[358:01.02]I couldn't see where I was going.
[358:02.20]I don't think I'm gonna do it.
[358:06.97]You know, like, get these trees out of the way!
[358:11.91]Hold on a minute.
[358:12.65]Can I even... What?
[358:18.47]Okay, so I have to go, uh... I guess... It's still possible, maybe.
[358:29.12]Probably not, though.
[358:30.76]And I figured they were all in a line.
[358:37.00]Nah, I'm not gonna get it.
[358:47.58]So, for next time, where's the easy way for me to get up here?
[358:50.46]Is it around the building, or do I have to jump from... Ah, it's over here.
[358:59.23]Ah, camera.
[359:02.13]I almost could have had it.
[359:26.71]I'm not allowed to fail the mission once to see where I need to go?
[359:32.51]Why?
[359:44.22]No, first try only!
[359:46.67]Only first try.
[359:48.08]Only.
[359:48.38]Having three kids really slows you down.
[360:00.66]How the fuck did you miss that one?
[360:02.40]I- I- How- Did you- You missed- You walked right by it.
[360:06.07]How did you miss that?
[360:07.09]Alright, so then now I- How did you walk right by it?
[360:09.13]I am fucking sitting here watching.
[360:11.37]How is it possible?
[360:12.13]I was probably just in a rage.
[360:14.33]Just so angry and just like huffing and puffing.
[360:16.85]I guarantee.
[360:17.65]That's what happens.
[360:20.21]Two.
[360:27.93]Uh...
[360:29.87]Gonna wrap around.
[360:34.92]Unless the running and the jumping is even.
[360:37.62]Ugh.
[360:57.42]I'm doing it wrong, but... Oh, man.
[361:00.32]I still can do it.
[361:04.44]I guess they'll get up there, I think.
[361:13.96]I'm just running in circles.
[361:17.94]Yeah, whatever.
[361:19.02]Is there a better way for me to get up there?
[361:29.28]Can I get over there from here though?
[361:30.60]I don't even know the way to get over there.
[361:33.86]I really don't.
[361:36.10]What the fuck are you doing, man?
[361:38.75]Go up on the billboard.
[361:40.79]This is so fucking bad.
[362:02.54]I'm about to get out of the goddamn tub!
[362:07.47]I'm gonna go teach this motherfucker a thing or two, then I'll play a game.
[362:37.33]Alright.
[362:39.83]Alright, billboard.
[362:52.16]Get off.
[362:52.56]Get off of it, Marge.
[362:53.40]What are you doing?
[362:59.90]Get it?
[363:00.22]Come on.
[363:15.54]I can barely watch this shit.
[363:29.47]Let's go.
[363:30.65]Oh my god, you're going the wrong fucking way!
[363:33.73]Oh!
[363:35.15]Just drop my fucking iPad in the tub.
[363:39.69]God fucking dear.
[363:43.86]Is it okay?
[363:44.60]Put it on... What should I do?
[363:46.11]Do I put it in the freezer, right?
[363:51.09]Hold on.
[363:51.87]Fuck.
[363:53.91]Put it on rice?
[363:59.26]I'll be back.
[364:01.26]Just give me...
[364:04.55]I think you should be aware that you're selling a tainted core.
[364:08.50]Where's this stuff coming from?
[364:10.36]There is little here not tainted in some way.
[364:12.72]Even the astrology scrolls give poor advice.
[364:15.48]But I will get to the bottom of this.
[364:17.38]Well, it made Bart go crazy.
[364:19.70]And if I find the distributor, I'm going to give them a piece of my mind.
[364:23.50]I will destroy them.
[364:24.40]I will try.
[364:50.40]It sounds like you're in mud.
[364:52.20]Kill trucks.
[364:53.52]I live in Vegas, man.
[364:54.36]We got hard water.
[364:55.68]Slow and steady wins the race.
[364:57.54]Can I dump fucking toxic waste on them?
[365:03.03]Okay.
[365:14.75]Yeah, this is not the right vehicle for this.
[365:16.32]Am I gonna have to do the whole Marge thing?
[365:17.80]No, sit up, because I might have to do the whole stupid soda can thing again.
[365:21.94]Oh, God, no.
[365:46.91]Gamer, sit up!
[365:48.41]Well, I'm not doing enough damage.
[366:14.64]Oh, somehow I pancaked him into the wall.
[366:18.78]Alright.
[366:19.68]Whatever.
[366:22.15]Let's go.
[366:40.53]Oh shit.
[366:40.95]Come here, loser!
[366:42.77]Get over here, loser!
[367:09.38]How's that not any damage?
[367:14.89]Alright, when he drives accidentally gently into the wall, it's more damage than flying off a goddamn cliff.
[367:26.24]Whoops.
[367:43.69]Into the wall.
[367:54.23]Yeah, I love the Tom Arnold music.
[367:57.19]No, that's an actor.
[367:58.07]What's his name?
[367:58.51]What the fuck are you doing?
[368:00.96]Why would you do that to me?
[368:10.20]I need you to drive into a wall.
[368:12.65]Or into another car or anything.
[368:15.05]Into this wall!
[368:17.31]Into something!
[368:19.75]Into the wall!
[368:21.21]Why does that not do any damage to you?
[368:29.50]Well, I don't know.
[368:30.18]Okay.
[368:32.18]That was two head-on car crashes.
[368:38.01]He got smashed into that car head-on.
[368:44.83]How did it blow up the first time because it bumped into a pole It smacked its side into a little median and it destroyed it
[369:10.96]I have to get a bigger car.
[369:12.98]Yeah, probably.
[369:14.40]The repo guys aren't going to like that.
[369:16.56]I can't.
[369:17.16]This is just going to get locked in.
[369:18.44]Just, hello, Superman.
[369:19.74]I'd like to fucking report a disturbance.
[369:26.15]Kind sir, could you get me a lift?
[369:43.00]Too bad he didn't use the clown car.
[369:44.53]I am just wait till he comes over here It's true women drivers aren't very good
[370:08.75]Look at these full rams.
[370:11.13]Get that hoopty rig off the road!
[370:25.68]I'm not very good at this.
[370:50.25]That was the same guy.
[370:57.05]He's gonna Dr- Oh, do I get credit for that?
[371:04.92]No, he's still alive.
[371:06.34]He's still alive.
[371:07.08]Yeah.
[371:07.68]Okay, great.
[371:08.62]That's fantastic.
[371:13.57]Just drove off the cliff into the ocean and he's still alive.
[371:21.77]Alright I don't understand he just crashed like three times Comes another one maybe I can get see what we went where was the damage on that?
[371:44.38]He just drove straight into that guy
[371:59.52]I'm not very good at this.
[372:03.02]I used to give my controller bite marks because of this game.
[372:17.34]Why do you keep hitting me?
[372:21.24]No, wait a second.
[372:29.01]That's so funny.
[372:30.87]Oh, no.
[372:31.23]Did I blow it?
[372:31.90]Look out.
[372:37.02]I'm going to lose.
[372:39.04]Oh.
[372:39.54]Ow, my tushy.
[372:44.36]Die.
[372:46.40]No time for caution.
[372:48.17]That's not very nice.
[372:50.09]Fight marks.
[372:50.95]Oh, doodlebugs.
[372:52.29]You're very narrow.
[372:57.29]I just beat every mission.
[372:58.87]Oh, give it a rest, alright?
[373:02.33]No way.
[373:03.05]I don't believe you.
[373:04.49]I don't believe you for a minute.
[373:11.80]I see some of you guys in this chat with your mouths going... You bit your controller because you lost in one of these missions like 15 times in a row.
[373:22.92]I know it.
[373:30.87]I'm certain of that.
[373:36.37]I mean, I didn't even have to say it.
[373:44.45]Somebody just talked about how they were biting things.
[373:56.82]Oh, come on.
[374:05.19]I have 2,000 hours in it.
[374:20.00]No, this car is going to explode.
[374:21.52]I can't do it here.
[374:22.94]No, I don't want to bite anything.
[374:26.20]If this car explodes, I'm turning on the webcam and I'm biting something.
[374:35.97]Nice girls.
[374:38.41]Finish fans.
[374:53.39]Jirba, how is it possible that you could be this bad?
[375:00.95]Adam Sandler.
[375:29.45]Adam Sandler.
[375:31.57]Ugh.
[375:34.63]Jerva.
[375:35.09]I mean, look at me.
[375:41.60]Idiot.
[375:41.94]Now where do I go?
[375:42.68]How about that?
[376:05.39]Thirty whatever.
[376:10.29]Thirty percent?
[376:11.17]Did he get thirty percent?
[376:14.99]I don't... I can't.
[376:16.29]There's no noise I can even do.
[376:19.76]Thirty percent?
[376:20.74]I can't!
[376:22.38]I can't.
[376:23.70]Wait.
[376:24.52]New character?
[376:31.12]Nice.
[376:43.72]Armor truck, armor truck, armor truck.
[376:47.42]Jerma sucks, Jerma sucks, Jerma... Alright, I don't wanna like keep pushing them.
[376:57.67]They stopped throwing rocks at my house!
[377:24.92]I hear like, this is what I hear right now.
[377:27.18]I hear like... Get her!
[377:33.00]They're throwing rocks at my house!
[377:35.40]Who's doing this?
[377:36.94]I open up my front door.
[377:37.90]You hit me in the mouth!
[377:41.28]And I close the door really fast.
[377:42.60]I got hit in the face with a rock.
[377:43.88]Do not fear.
[377:44.92]You will be reincarnated.
[377:59.90]We got him cornered.
[378:02.68]What does it want me to do?
[378:04.17]300 horses of convenient power.
[378:06.61]Go to hurry up or my arranged bride will chastise me.
[378:16.36]I have been selling tainted cola.
[378:18.31]Unless I redeem myself, I will be reincarnated as a sea cucumber.
[378:21.83]Or worse, a land cucumber.
[378:24.53]I must find the source of this evil beverage.
[378:27.35]The Sode Invo is commanded I go here.
[378:29.56]They're just whipping rocks at my house.
[378:32.10]I look over and I'm like, what are they saying?
[378:35.42]I am the greatest driver in all the land.
[378:43.77]Follow the cola truck and collect all the evidence.
[378:45.47]Don't miss any cola.
[378:46.71]I must admit, the smell of fresh air is much more pleasing than the odor of the hot dog machine.
[378:51.90]Who put this here?
[378:53.10]It makes no sense.
[378:54.46]This is just between me and you, random object.
[379:03.14]Go to the road and onto the sidewalk.
[379:18.00]Is this the armor truck thing that you guys are talking about?
[379:19.66]Holy shit.
[379:31.10]Will I know if it's the armor truck level because will there be rocks thrown at my house?
[379:34.30]You know what I mean?
[379:37.16]Is that... Probably?
[379:45.88]Oh, okay.
[380:13.72]Clean up in aisle one.
[380:16.53]Oh!
[380:42.37]Legator, I'll punch you in the vital areas.
[380:45.33]Don't come in here.
[380:46.07]We're making sausage.
[380:46.81]Man sausages.
[381:10.71]Hello stereotypical Italians.
[381:12.83]Pleased to tell me the source of the evil cola.
[381:15.06]We don't know nothing.
[381:16.82]Except that the vans are controlled by mysterious strangers.
[381:19.52]Anyway, you shouldn't stick your nose in other people's business.
[381:22.92]It could come back to haunt you and your family.
[381:26.08]Oh my gosh.
[381:27.24]Your thinly veiled threat has reminded me of my fatherly duties.
[381:30.82]I'm supposed to pick up the octuplets at the doctor's.
[381:35.15]Drive to the hospital before time runs out.
[381:37.07]Avoid the mob.
[381:37.71]Hopefully my store will not be robbed more than four times while I am driving around today.
[381:44.04]There's a time limit here.
[381:46.74]My god.
[381:49.48]And I gotta get away from the limo.
[381:51.16]I couldn't get away.
[381:51.92]It turned into my face.
[381:59.34]This is a good car.
[382:07.50]I'm popping away.
[382:13.30]Here we go.
[382:18.86]Away from me.
[382:20.36]Did I lose him?
[382:22.14]Not yet.
[382:22.86]Fuck.
[382:23.32]Come on.
[382:24.26]I gotta lose you somewhere.
[382:25.12]I get a bang and you turn.
[382:33.80]Oh, come on.
[382:36.09]Got it.
[382:59.63]I'm actually not sure what the hell I just did.
[383:00.68]To complete this mission you will need Homer's custom-built car.
[383:28.96]purchase it from Homer in the hospital parking lot.
[383:32.08]500 coins.
[383:32.78]Or call it from a phone.
[383:35.10]How much money do I have?
[383:43.49]Well, thankfully there's bugs over here with money.
[383:45.97]500.
[383:47.67]I'm going to have to do some exploring.
[384:02.63]Hmm... I see over here.
[384:05.45]Sick.
[384:18.23]Please drink water, it's been six hours.
[384:22.23]I haven't- I've been getting a dri- You guys don't really think I'm just sitting here like- HELP!
[384:29.87]HELP ME!
[384:31.22]HELP!
[384:31.58]DRY IT OUT!
[384:33.80]If you give me a ride, I will pay you a million dollars in the next life, I promise.
[384:42.65]This is not good for my insurance.
[384:44.45]What do we got?
[384:44.99]Over here?
[384:48.82]It's a couple of coins and a wrench.
[384:50.74]I need way more than this.
[385:04.44]Well, we got another mission here.
[385:08.04]Excuse me, nice Mr. Shopkeeper person.
[385:11.08]Have you seen a hovering death machine?
[385:13.66]No, nothing specifically of the hovering kind, no.
[385:17.22]Oh, this was to be my greatest invention since sideburns in a can.
[385:22.15]They make you handsome and lovely.
[385:24.21]What are you talking about?
[385:25.25]I call it the hover car, TM.
[385:27.49]So don't try to steal the name, it's TM'd.
[385:29.91]I installed the on-board computer and it came alive and attacked my person.
[385:34.19]For the love of all that's gliding, you gotta help me here.
[385:37.13]Okay, what on Earth can I do?
[385:38.65]Knock the Flushiggin' the thing off the road before the authorities come and take me away again.
[385:44.03]Prisons ain't kind to pencil-neck geeks like myself.
[385:47.82]They stomp and they kick.
[385:50.87]Jerva died hours ago, we're just hearing the gases releasing.
[385:54.41]What?
[385:54.53]What are you talking about?
[385:56.35]Hahaha.
[385:56.69]Hahaha.
[386:19.83]Perhaps I should refrain from doing that.
[386:21.70]Oh, look!
[386:24.66]You fucked it up, didn't you?
[386:28.58]Oh, never mind.
[386:35.13]Move it, Cracker.
[386:38.05]What are you trying to do with this crazy driving?
[386:41.57]What in the hell were you thinking?
[386:48.36]It's a Futurama reference.
[386:49.42]I know.
[386:49.76]When they squeeze on him and he goes... I've seen that video.
[386:53.54]I've seen that movie.
[386:54.94]I've seen that TV program.
[386:56.40]Stupid!
[387:17.43]That's not a shortcut.
[387:18.25]So I get this car.
[387:25.31]Don't you guys tell me?
[387:26.51]Move.
[387:52.13]Why are you pointing at every direction arrows?
[387:53.97]Move.
[387:55.97]Oh no.
[387:57.25]No, no, no!
[388:00.70]I'm fine.
[388:18.97]Hey, Professor.
[388:20.13]How are you?
[388:21.17]Great work, my Hindu friend.
[388:23.31]Do not patronize my faith, OK?
[388:25.08]Sorry.
[388:25.60]Terribly sorry.
[388:27.22]Look, if you need a ride, instant message my cortex, by which I mean, call me.
[388:32.82]Thank you all for coming.
[388:35.56]I'll see you in hell.
[388:38.16]Professor Frank's hover car.
[388:39.18]Go to a phone booth to use it.
[388:45.65]Is it good?
[389:00.52]Damn.
[389:00.66]Can you hide all the spoilers?
[389:03.57]Uh, in the game?
[389:03.97]There are no spoilers.
[389:05.23]What are you talking about?
[389:22.26]Oh, that's right.
[389:22.62]I need 500 coins.
[389:23.12]Shit.
[389:23.96]Find them.
[389:54.14]I need a lot.
[389:55.08]Aye, okay.
[389:55.52]Up this way.
[389:56.10]Some coins.
[389:56.40]A few.
[389:56.72]I need to go explore.
[389:57.46]Looking for some kind of...
[390:24.94]I'm not close enough.
[390:26.30]Yes, I am.
[390:28.92]Am I?
[390:31.92]Am I enjoying the game?
[390:37.82]Uh, yeah.
[390:39.37]I think so.
[390:39.85]Let me know.
[390:50.77]Am I?
[390:51.57]I'm not?
[390:53.06]Hurry up or my arranged bride will
[390:55.73]He's not.
[390:58.27]Why?
[390:58.55]Because I went... Something along those lines.
[391:04.32]And I said, someone rocks at me!
[391:06.28]I think that's what I remember saying.
[391:09.82]Oh, that was pretty badass.
[391:17.43]I need you.
[391:17.79]Come here.
[391:37.88]Can I go far enough?
[391:42.42]Can I even jump on this?
[391:45.54]It'd be just great if the camera could turn.
[391:49.08]I guess I can't go on that.
[392:18.54]Did I not get that coin?
[392:19.28]Alright, there's probably a box up here.
[392:21.18]Or a bee?
[392:22.66]Any bees?
[392:25.08]I don't see a bee, and I don't... Oh, there we go.
[392:26.81]And there's a box up here.
[392:28.03]Good.
[392:28.19]500, right?
[392:28.77]And there's another bee.
[392:34.57]Good.
[392:49.92]Come here.
[392:50.16]I don't want you to spill coins all over them.
[392:52.06]I'm not going to be able to get them.
[392:53.16]You're shooting at me.
[392:55.48]Okay.
[393:01.65]I shouldn't have bought all those dumb clothes.
[393:03.13]I'd have way more money.
[393:16.17]I'm not even close.
[393:17.07]Actually, I can go from here to there.
[393:21.42]Ah, interesting.
[393:22.48]Can I get up there still?
[393:23.58]Window sill?
[393:27.74]No.
[393:30.16]Well, I need to get back on that roof.
[393:33.06]What else can I do?
[393:35.26]Something on the other side?
[393:38.42]Nope.
[393:49.08]Nice jump.
[393:49.70]Ah, I couldn't have made it.
[393:50.96]I could not have made it.
[393:51.76]I see you with a rock in your hand.
[393:55.74]Put it down.
[393:57.16]There's no reason for that.
[394:03.36]Let's see.
[394:07.67]Can I get up here?
[394:15.77]Let me see... Can I make it?
[394:18.05]I guess I can make it from here to there.
[394:19.65]Can I?
[394:23.61]Huh.
[394:26.82]There's that little ledge right here, but can I just make that?
[394:30.24]Am I lined up?
[394:35.60]It's like the claw machine.
[394:36.98]Okay.
[394:40.51]Okay.
[394:44.34]This side is more important.
[394:45.68]No!
[394:45.90]What the fuck?
[394:48.02]What the fuck?
[394:52.40]It just pushed me off.
[394:53.52]I didn't touch anything.
[395:02.19]I just kind of fell off.
[395:04.25]Well, let's do it again.
[395:07.93]I think I can just jump.
[395:14.44]Okay, now let's try this again.
[395:21.35]Alright, good.
[395:25.11]Good, good.
[395:26.35]Kill the bee.
[395:34.60]We're almost there to the last mission of the game.
[395:36.20]Can you see how close we are?
[395:39.76]Final mission incoming.
[395:48.42]There's another platform over here.
[395:59.53]No.
[395:59.79]There's like three more levels?
[396:04.92]Yeah, so we're at the final one.
[396:08.56]After those two.
[396:22.85]From here, is this the other building?
[396:26.65]Not the same one.
[396:27.19]Alright.
[396:28.70]Need more money.
[396:35.76]Car wash?
[396:39.48]Car wash?
[396:54.35]Nothing.
[396:54.63]Wait, nothing in the car?
[396:55.79]I already got the car wash money.
[397:00.67]The next level is bot and then homo.
[397:01.95]Bot, bot, homo.
[397:02.61]Mod.
[397:03.73]I see coins up there.
[397:04.67]Is there a way for me to get up there?
[397:31.08]What's the blue underneath here?
[397:33.77]Can I interact with this?
[397:42.03]Doesn't look like it.
[397:43.45]What does stairs do?
[397:54.14]Are there stairs over here?
[397:58.73]On one of these boxcars?
[398:01.79]He did this earlier.
[398:02.65]Yeah, I know, but I'm on a different character.
[398:06.29]Can't go in.
[398:06.71]That was an incredible move.
[398:13.51]There might be another way.
[398:14.33]I guess I could go on a car and then... Anywhere inside that I can go?
[398:26.57]It makes no sense.
[398:29.08]no random place I can go in the corner or something I don't think so well I can probably jump from I can't jump from that can I jump from this
[399:01.66]Just go up the stairs.
[399:03.96]I mean, we're talking about all the way back here.
[399:33.49]Can I make it from here to there?
[399:34.65]I'm going to have to run very far away.
[399:36.85]I have to go all the way across.
[399:39.33]Is there anything even over there?
[399:40.39]There's nothing even over there worth getting.
[399:42.53]I did this earlier, yeah, but I'm talking about over past that top of that thing over there.
[399:48.92]And that's what I get.
[399:52.42]I'm not talking about getting to where those coins are.
[399:54.18]I'm talking about the other side.
[399:58.88]I'm talking like down there.
[400:27.96]This'll do it. 500.
[400:40.78]Is he on drugs?
[400:42.00]Uh, no.
[400:43.00]When you hold run in this game, it makes you, it forces you to go into a straight line.
[400:48.65]So, for about a half second, when you run, you have to go in the direction that you started the run.
[400:53.09]You can't turn.
[400:54.34]So it's like, whoop!
[400:56.02]So sometimes you fall.
[400:57.26]Sometimes you slip.
[401:00.24]Alright, let's go.
[401:11.13]Why'd I jump down?
[401:11.77]Because I have 500 coins.
[401:12.79]I don't want that card.
[401:29.52]Alright.
[401:32.16]Buy it. 500.
[401:40.68]Where is it?
[401:41.06]I thought I could buy it from the... From here, right?
[401:50.13]Could I buy it from here?
[401:57.25]Have to buy it from... I thought you could buy it from a phone.
[402:03.97]Oh.
[402:07.63]You have to talk to Homer, but... Weren't there a bunch of other scenarios where I could just get it from the phone?
[402:17.63]He said you can summon it at a phone.
[402:18.91]Uh, yeah.
[402:19.21]That's what I thought.
[402:33.84]Move your clumsy vehicle!
[402:59.17]Get out of the way!
[403:04.28]Excuse me.
[403:04.82]Alright, Springfield Park.
[403:11.66]Springfield Hospital is down this way over there.
[403:15.75]This is the park.
[403:23.59]Here we are.
[403:25.87]Hello, Homer.
[403:29.07]I'll take your custom car, please.
[403:31.23]Do you have an oversized vehicle?
[403:33.45]Whoops.
[403:38.28]Okay, there it is.
[403:39.52]Car built for Homer of 500 coins.
[403:41.12]I must admit, the smell of fresh air is much more pleasing than the odor of the hot dog machine.
[403:52.51]Left the van and collected the diapers.
[403:57.57]You almost hit a person!
[404:00.23]In Homer's underwater taxi.
[404:03.32]This is just between me and you, random object!
[404:10.16]You thought he was going over the thing.
[404:11.48]Hold on, itchy nose.
[404:13.88]Not good.
[404:16.04]I gotta restart.
[404:18.08]Hopefully my store will not be robbed more than four times while I am driving around today.
[404:30.20]Alright.
[404:31.92]Who's in this car?
[404:34.32]Who the fuck is in this car?
[404:42.23]Oh, I smashed my skull!
[404:47.40]Uh, Ambulance, can you please... Use Horn!
[404:58.56]Use Horn!
[405:10.14]This guy's driving me wrong.
[405:15.97]This guy's freaking me out.
[405:17.71]Bad.
[405:18.39]Big time.
[405:21.93]Okay, drive to the hospital.
[405:24.67]Alright, talk to Dr. Hibbert.
[405:36.78]Alright, final mission incoming.
[406:03.13]That was way too fast.
[406:08.09]Here we are at our final destination.
[406:10.21]It's just between me and you, random object.
[406:13.85]I know my face cam's not on.
[406:15.43]Why?
[406:15.55]There's no rea- Put down the rocks!
[406:34.42]Hello, famous American clown.
[406:36.32]I wish to ask a favor.
[406:37.74]Everyone wants to wet their beaks.
[406:41.78]I require information about drugs delivering evil cola.
[406:45.27]How can I get this classified data?
[406:47.17]Sorry, Apu.
[406:48.49]I'm a drink-squeezy, punchy lowlife.
[406:50.79]You need a professional scumbag.
[406:51.75]You're putting them down by throwing them.
[406:53.03]Follow a cop until you find one.
[406:55.11]You'll have better luck if you, you know, look American.
[406:59.69]Thank you, horrible man.
[407:02.95]Need to disguise, purchase, use American clothes.
[407:06.01]Another 425 coins.
[407:06.89]Shit.
[407:07.47]57 coins.
[407:08.03]Alright, we have to scrounge around now.
[407:29.04]We gotta find boxes, we gotta find soda machines.
[407:33.33]There's a box over here.
[407:34.15]Do a wager race?
[407:41.24]We've seen how much of a disaster those were.
[407:58.89]Alright.
[407:59.63]Not a bad start.
[408:08.24]Destroy cars.
[408:09.04]Another box right here.
[408:16.48]And a bee.
[408:30.39]That took a lot longer than it should have.
[408:31.93]400, right?
[408:39.80]Or was it 425?
[408:56.58]Nothing, nothing, nothing.
[408:59.06]What about the statues?
[409:10.83]I need to get in a car.
[409:19.70]How about one of my cars?
[409:25.14]Try doing a race with a hover car?
[409:27.35]Let's try it.
[409:30.19]So, let's try whatever you got here.
[409:34.73]There's a box behind you.
[409:51.08]Hey, aren't you the boy who nearly drowned in the nacho cheese?
[409:53.66]I was in the newspaper!
[409:55.40]Alright.
[410:00.48]Do I actually get money for these?
[410:03.66]Am I gonna hit it?
[410:05.80]Ah, that was a blocked out... Too slow, opposing vehicle!
[410:08.30]Color me outraged!
[410:12.34]You have no chance!
[410:17.60]This is a slippery course.
[410:21.78]Oi.
[410:24.62]Hmm.
[410:28.54]Do they block off of most of these ways to skip through?
[410:36.11]Um, I think I'm going to have to restart this.
[410:37.87]Yeah, this is a lost cause right now.
[410:57.18]Unless I can... I don't think I can do anything.
[410:59.84]No.
[411:00.99]Maybe I could have, like... Spun around.
[411:04.75]Um... This is not even going to give me money.
[411:20.02]If I beat this, do I get coins?
[411:21.96]I don't think that's going to happen.
[411:34.54]Maybe.
[411:34.94]Let's see.
[411:37.51]The journey is the reward.
[411:39.89]Now that's true.
[412:00.98]Mmm, floaty.
[412:01.60]I'm really floaty.
[412:03.30]I will tell you.
[412:04.88]I don't think I'm ever gonna do this.
[412:16.47]He's about to beat me, isn't he?
[412:19.73]I wonder why.
[412:20.45]Maybe it's because you are literally floating.
[412:22.77]A little too floaty.
[412:46.38]It's not even going to give me money at this point.
[412:48.28]Hit it!
[412:49.52]What?
[412:49.98]I just fell off.
[413:24.72]I got a feeling I'll get it up here.
[413:26.48]Maybe.

[415:40.89]No, that's the wrong.
[415:41.91]You're just very silly.
[415:42.99]You're a foolish person.
[415:46.69]Now he's going to think that's the right way.
[415:48.09]No, I think that's the wrong way.
[415:50.23]Hey, watch it, buster.
[415:52.58]I think that's the incorrect way.
[415:55.06]Or do I?
[415:57.00]I'll never know.
[416:00.34]The person is stuck on my car.
[416:03.20]Alright, I got, uh, there is, can I get up there?

[417:19.05]I thought I could get it by just jumping.
[417:24.19]Can I get up there?
[417:24.67]I think I can.
[417:26.17]Hold on.
[417:26.43]I don't think so.

[435:38.64]I didn't know.
[435:39.34]I didn't know.
[435:39.86]I didn't know.

[451:32.79]I don't care.
[451:33.17]Give me a ticket.
[451:34.13]Write it up.
[451:35.49]I don't need it.
[452:05.48]Oh, yeah.

[452:07.42]I am the greatest driver.
[452:11.34]I never thought I'd say this, but I'm actually excited to be going to a museum.
[452:15.18]I don't need... No, I'm talking about what do I need the money for.
[452:19.58]In The Simpsons video game.

[454:50.95]Right?
[454:53.65]Oops.

[455:47.71]One, two, three, go.
[455:49.21]It's time for some road rage.
[455:50.91]Do I have to stop or just run over?
[455:53.17]OK, just run over.
[455:54.83]Oh, it's a breakdown.
[455:56.51]I just had it detailed.
[456:01.84]Alright.
[456:06.80]Oh, come on.
[456:09.92]Self-explanatory.
[456:13.24]Just get him in the car.
[456:14.68]I was assuming we were going to be going the other way.
[456:20.69]I didn't do it.
[456:31.84]Did somebody have to go through the fire?
[456:35.17]Did I get... We didn't make it.
[456:44.38]We didn't make it.
[456:46.10]And that didn't pick him up.
[456:47.04]Apparently not.
[456:55.23]Here come the cocks.
[456:55.87]What's going on?
[456:57.55]Just the remaining five.
[457:00.49]There's only four more.
[457:02.19]Got plenty of time.
[457:05.07]13, 14, 15.
[457:05.13]Oh my god.
[457:22.92]Well, I ain't gonna get there in 15 seconds.
[457:33.00]Ow, my skull.
[457:34.35]My beautiful skull.
[457:36.67]Stupid fucking thing.
[457:37.99]Oh my god.

[457:58.36]I'm scared and disoriented!
[458:20.13]Bart Simpson style.
[458:22.85]Just leave the driving to me, dude.
[458:30.39]I just know I'm going to be blamed for this.
[458:40.13]I hope this car can take it.
[458:42.25]Oh man, this sucks.
[458:47.12]I can still get it just don't drive into the studio symbol this is not about speed it's just about getting there in the time you don't have to go fast just pick up those kids get them in the school bus I have plenty more time
[459:15.66]Just a straight shot.
[459:16.74]Here's the studio.
[459:17.54]Right up here.
[459:20.99]Don't worry about the time.
[459:22.05]It's just there to make you panic.
[459:25.69]I'm fine.
[459:26.25]I made it.
[459:26.93]There we go.
[459:27.51]Straight ahead.
[459:28.51]Forget about the time.
[459:29.29]I have to... Get out of my fucking way!
[459:32.21]I win.
[459:32.86]Perfection, thy name is Bart.
[459:45.33]Any money?
[459:45.87]I don't see any money.
[459:54.52]Barney, where's Krusty?
[459:55.88]I have to warn him.
[459:57.02]Krusty's not here, little Homer.
[459:58.88]He's down at the squid port.
[460:00.09]There's that kid again.
[460:00.75]I want a promo for this new buzz cola.
[460:03.27]That's the cola the aliens are using to control all human behavior.
[460:06.97]Control human behavior?
[460:08.63]No beverage could do that.
[460:10.83]Oh no, I haven't had a duff in two hours.
[460:13.39]My life is over.
[460:17.29]But I have to get to Krusty before the limo does.
[460:19.73]And I have to stay here and go through the DTs.
[460:22.45]Sounds like a plan.
[460:25.40]Uh, well, it just blew by.
[460:26.17]Okay.
[460:26.29]Where did...
[461:01.26]That's not a shortcut, and I thought it was.
[461:02.66]Eat asphalt, asphalt eaters.
[461:07.34]It's over.
[461:08.02]Come on.
[461:10.88]Bart Simpson at your service.
[461:15.77]Get in, Bart.
[461:16.43]Hurry.
[461:23.15]This sucks.
[461:26.85]Don't even worry about it.
[461:27.93]Everything's fine.
[461:29.25]Let's roll.
[461:32.00]Hey, thanks for the boost, motherfucker!
[461:51.84]You made this much easier on me.
[461:54.62]And I thank you for that.
[462:07.87]Changing lanes twice in a row.
[462:10.73]Change lanes.
[462:11.25]Change lanes.
[462:11.79]Change lanes.
[462:13.29]Talk to the limo driver.
[462:14.87]What are you doing?
[462:16.07]What?
[462:16.19]What just happened?
[462:36.89]He just peeled out.
[462:41.84]Um... I see him.
[462:50.98]He's in my sights.
[462:51.59]Hold on.
[462:52.93]Out of the way.
[462:55.71]Out of the way.
[463:10.62]I'm just glad I'm not... No problemo!
[463:15.14]Oh my fucking god.
[463:16.49]What happened when I went to go talk to the limo driver?
[463:18.57]It was like... Time to race!
[463:26.45]Oh man, that sucks and blows.
[463:28.32]Eat asphalt, asphalt eaters!
[463:37.66]Just park your car.
[463:38.42]I'm gonna park my car in front of his.
[463:40.97]Yeah.
[463:41.79]What the hell was that?
[463:56.56]Okay.
[463:57.92]Don't do that shit again.
[463:58.90]Yeah.
[464:01.22]What do you know?
[464:02.52]Good luck.
[464:03.52]You fucking asshole.
[464:04.62]Yeah.
[464:04.82]I totally rule.
[464:21.42]Time to lay some rubber down.
[464:24.12]Boy, I oughta...
[464:39.75]What have I done?!
[464:43.57]It's not even possible!
[464:45.31]I did the... I did the shortcut and it just got stuck in the fuckin' spokes of the wheel!
[465:07.50]Why is that thing here?
[465:11.28]What is the point of that thing?
[465:13.42]I just heard myself scream across the house.
[465:18.08]I was across the whole fucking house.
[465:20.20]And through headphones, I heard me scream.
[465:23.22]And I thought something was wrong with the computer.
[465:24.76]I thought it was a computer glitch.
[465:26.70]I was like, why did the computer make that noise?
[465:28.40]I hate things.
[465:36.05]Alright.
[465:37.15]I'm gonna park a different car in front of him.
[465:39.56]No, you know what?
[465:40.66]Fuck you, game.
[465:41.82]I'm gonna park like five cars in that road.
[465:48.29]I'm gonna fill up the whole road with cars.
[465:56.49]I'm gonna put a truck there.
[465:57.91]I'm gonna put... Yeah.
[465:59.99]Make sure I got my car up here.
[466:02.11]Yeah.
[466:02.83]Okay.
[466:04.03]Hey.
[466:04.89]Have fun.
[466:06.87]Good luck getting around this.
[466:11.33]It's gonna take a goddamn Christmas miracle for you to get out of here.
[466:17.83]I'm going now.
[466:18.35]There we go.
[466:20.51]Okay.
[466:24.27]Let's hit the town.
[466:47.42]Nice driving, man.
[466:50.67]Time to rock.
[466:57.79]Oh, this is too cool for school.
[467:02.70]Okay, any more cars?
[467:07.28]I think that's good.
[467:09.26]He's gonna back out?
[467:10.15]No, no, no, don't you worry about that.
[467:11.55]He ain't backing out.
[467:20.52]Eat my dust, dust eaters.
[467:27.34]It's time for some road rage, Bart Simpson style.
[467:35.69]Eat ass, bald-ass bald-eaters.
[467:36.91]Yeah, eat ass.
[467:37.95]Good luck.
[467:40.03]You're going to need it.
[467:48.03]Full speed ahead.
[467:51.22]God, did you get out of that?
[467:53.72]So quickly.
[467:57.46]No way.
[468:00.56]There were three cars in front of you.
[468:17.24]He fucked me up.
[468:18.84]He fucked me up so bad.
[468:29.33]Get this correct do I go over this thing do I go through this thing?
[468:38.43]Talk to Krusty

[469:18.73]Find and follow Professor Frink.
[469:20.55]Bart Simpson at your service.
[469:23.53]Okay.
[469:24.93]Time to lay some rubber down.
[469:27.57]People conveniently just drive right by you.
[469:29.45]Take that!
[469:49.78]You are magically not hitting any of these obstacles in the way.
[470:01.75]When I beat this game, I'm going to reward myself with a triple cheeseburger.
[470:09.22]I'm getting a triple cheeseburger.
[470:11.96]And Jack gets to pick from where?
[470:22.07]Go to the Krusty Burger.
[470:23.49]Oh, that was so cool.
[470:51.50]From a garbage can.
[470:53.78]Uh, I'm not going to do that.
[470:59.02]Are we going to get that cutscene where he stops?
[471:09.66]You can't order a burger from Amazon, can you?
[471:16.97]Uh, AM Scoots.

[471:21.34]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[471:24.50]Tons of community subs tonight, guys.
[471:25.70]You guys rock.
[471:27.70]I almost didn't make that jump.
[471:39.24]Amazon Restaurants is a thing.
[471:42.90]That's interesting.
[471:49.16]Professor Frank, you've got to help me.
[471:51.06]No one believes my story.
[471:52.48]It's just like the boy who cried wolf, except instead of a wolf, it's an alien conspiracy.
[471:56.78]Aliens?
[471:57.12]Well, that would explain these strange transmissions from my plutonium CB radio.
[472:03.38]I must have intercepted an alien message.
[472:06.06]It says they're hiding the lasers in the duff trucks.
[472:09.14]Glahive and Glivey, the plot is convoluted now.
[472:12.38]Relax, nerdlinger.
[472:13.68]I'll knock the lasers out of the trucks so I can show them to Krusty.
[472:18.55]Drive to the brewery and stop the alien's plan.
[472:20.85]Hit the truck and collect the laser guns.
[472:24.97]Alright.
[472:25.91]I think we're about to see the final mission of the game before Homer Simpson has like eight more missions.
[472:29.85]Might as well get these right here.
[472:53.67]How did I get up here?
[473:34.57]Oops.
[473:36.25]Parked there.
[473:39.17]I'm gonna have to redo it.
[473:41.21]I'm gonna have to redo it.
[473:44.83]Oh my god.
[473:45.79]It happened again.
[473:47.13]I did the thing where the mission ends and it just goes to the end screen and I pressed up
[474:10.64]Car's about to explode.
[474:13.61]God damn it.
[474:20.85]I may as well just have a thing blow up.
[474:22.14]Take this!
[474:54.52]Professor!
[475:05.50]I don't have a car anymore, though.
[475:15.79]Does it still think this is my car?
[475:18.29]Oh.
[475:19.51]Get a new one.
[475:24.62]Okay.
[475:25.50]Try to get there in one piece, Bart.
[475:28.28]If you could try, that'd be wonderful.
[475:35.51]What is the speedrun on this game?
[475:37.65]What's, like, world record?
[475:49.52]Three seconds?
[475:51.60]How does that...
[475:55.09]Is there like a way to clip through the map and cheat or something?
[476:01.59]By the way, where the fuck am I going?
[476:04.81]What is happening to me?
[476:12.86]Do I really not have that much time to get down there?
[476:17.26]I have to go through some kind of shortcut or something, don't I?
[476:25.78]Alright, well I need to I'm obviously looking at chat again because I'm asking questions Hour and 28 minutes Bart simpson at your service I think I need to take a bath after this
[476:56.79]And just lie there with my eyes closed and cucumbers in my eyes.
[476:59.13]What the fuck was that horse shit, man?
[477:14.13]I'm just going through here.
[477:15.27]Fuck it.
[477:15.55]If I would tell you... Forget it.
[477:17.61]What do I do?
[477:18.29]Hit the duff truck and destroy the boxes?
[477:25.36]Hit the dump truck.
[477:26.22]Get the boxes.
[477:27.64]I need six.
[477:34.74]Two.
[477:36.02]Good RNG there.
[477:38.52]Good RNG.
[477:38.94]Good RNG.
[477:42.06]Good RNG.
[478:04.41]Nothing?
[478:10.47]Nothing from that either.
[478:19.10]Back to Duff Brewery.
[478:24.96]Back to Duff Brewery.
[478:25.82]Let's go.
[478:48.26]Don't drive off the cliff or something.
[478:50.75]No, and the police are on the way.
[479:00.07]Find a laser gun to use as proof.
[479:04.59]Where do you want... What is it?
[479:05.67]What is it?
[479:06.53]What is it?
[479:08.43]Chat, help me out here.
[479:09.25]What's going on?
[479:09.71]What happened here?
[479:10.37]Find a laser gun to use.
[479:11.82]Pick up a laser gun.
[479:18.82]Go right through the glass.
[479:23.10]Nice one.
[479:34.23]Drive to the taffy shop?
[479:34.99]Now you got my attention, right?
[479:36.45]Chat help?
[479:37.07]I probably would have driven off the flip.
[479:40.25]Speaking of which... No, don't do that.
[479:42.67]What if it ends the mission or something?
[479:45.11]That doesn't hit...
[480:05.05]Apparently it doesn't hit you.
[480:15.03]Save game.
[480:15.57]Thank you so much for that.
[480:23.38]You know what?
[480:24.12]I've... Never mind.
[480:27.16]I was wrong.
[480:29.40]I thought I was going to say something that made sense, but it was not going to make any sense.
[480:36.59]You're all mine.
[480:43.71]Save, save, save, save, save.
[480:44.73]I got it.
[480:46.01]Principal Skinner.
[480:50.48]Principal Skinner!
[480:51.82]Aliens are distributing deadly lasers all over Springfield.
[480:54.94]We gotta warn everybody!
[480:56.54]All we've gotta do, young man, is get that illicit goo-gaw out of your hands.
[480:59.36]Stream until Twitch shuts you off at 48 hours.
[481:05.45]Uh, why would I do that?
[481:07.47]Destroy Principal Skimmer's car and take back the laser gun before time runs out.
[481:11.17]I'm just gonna block him and push him into the ocean.
[481:28.87]No problemo!
[481:38.33]I need some speed.
[481:41.07]Odd.
[481:45.01]Felt like I did some damage to you, but apparently I didn't.
[481:51.76]Apparently I didn't do any damage to you.
[482:01.15]I just hurt myself.
[482:07.70]Man, you just took a huge hit.
[482:18.97]Take that.
[482:19.81]Lousy laws of physics.
[482:27.81]Use a stronger car?
[482:29.18]Yeah, but I mean... When I string together the mission like this, I kind of... I guess I could just jump out right now.
[482:36.10]I can get it.
[482:37.38]I'll get it.
[482:38.10]Yeah, he'll run into a wall and his car will explode.
[482:48.83]Here it comes.
[482:50.25]Look at how fast he's going.
[482:51.15]He can't control it.
[482:51.75]Right into this wall, straight ahead.
[482:55.25]Got it.
[483:07.34]Almost dead.
[483:09.28]I keep like peeling them out when I don't mean to do that.
[483:35.94]convenient, just go two miles per hour into me.
[483:38.80]See, this is where he could have done it.
[483:40.00]I need to slow down and just get right up him.
[484:09.47]Alright, maybe I do need to bag a car just to drive into him, because this is not working.
[484:19.13]This doesn't do enough damage when you hit him.
[484:24.58]Figured that would have done a lot of damage, but apparently not.
[484:30.42]I'd have to get, like, the plow or something.
[484:31.94]Okay, that just... Where the fuck did he... My brain... I thought he drove off the cliff, and then... Oh, man.
[484:43.31]Get it.
[484:43.65]Skinner is dead.
[485:02.99]Skinner and his mom.
[485:04.89]They were both in the same car.
[485:08.27]So they were together.
[485:22.49]Shavar, the car is on fire!
[485:25.27]I'll pick her up in a moment, brother.
[485:34.90]Prepare to be stuck on this level for an hour.
[485:43.85]Oh no.
[485:57.80]Oh, man.
[485:58.60]I better get some heavy artillery if I'm gonna take out that much private property.
[486:03.53]Courtney should have something good.
[486:04.55]To complete this mission, you'll need the Globex Supervillain Car.
[486:09.69]Purchase it from, uh, for 600 coins.
[486:15.40]How many coins do I have now?
[486:17.06]I need more coins!
[486:25.42]200.
[486:25.44]Are these expensive?
[486:27.38]Somebody just said cheat.
[486:53.95]I can't cheat.
[486:55.53]I gotta play the way the game was meant to be played.
[486:58.63]Once you cheat, you can't go back.
[487:00.35]There's no turning back after a cheat.
[487:02.35]Alright, which way do I want to go?
[487:06.93]Let's go this way first.
[487:17.72]Um... So what was the point of that?
[487:24.95]Nothing up here.
[487:27.81]Oh my... Holy shit, that's a lot of money.
[487:33.22]Wow.
[487:44.48]Didn't even need to cheat.
[487:45.34]The code is right in here.
[488:05.94]Alright.
[488:06.56]That helps.
[488:07.46]A lot.
[488:08.88]Any more hidden rooms that have money?
[488:10.62]There's a spot to go over here.
[488:20.31]Um... I guess I could have jumped over the other side.
[488:23.99]I wonder what's over there.
[488:24.67]Let me get over there again.
[488:40.98]Alright, cool.
[488:53.27]I thought this was going to take a lot longer.
[488:56.21]Thankfully, there was this shit over here.
[488:58.77]And I got another thing to platform around on.
[489:02.23]Where will this take me?
[489:04.55]Back to the... Yeah, back to where I was.
[489:09.80]Yeah, save the game.
[489:11.84]Good call.
[489:12.32]You missed a bonfire.
[489:20.75]Oh, well.
[489:27.79]Box over here.
[489:28.53]I'm going to guess yes.
[489:29.67]There's quite a lot back here.
[489:42.82]It's gonna be done.
[489:43.33]I already did it.
[489:46.13]500 coins.
[489:46.51]Did I wish FromSoftware would make a Simpsons Souls?
[489:54.34]Look at the amount of characters that are in this universe.
[489:58.68]It'd be great.
[490:15.57]Eh, nothing over there.
[490:20.81]Or like, dumbma985.
[490:23.81]Get it?
[490:29.13]You know, that's the first rock I've seen thrown in... at least... at least probably an hour or two.
[490:45.47]Alright, almost got it.
[490:53.17]So I have to go buy... I guess I can buy it from right there, right?
[490:58.58]Can I?
[491:00.48]I need... I need a little bit more money.
[491:03.82]I think that... There's probably some over here I can get.
[491:08.76]Maybe.
[491:09.06]Did I miss anything? $5.59.
[491:22.18]music coming from out here the boat this break ship I'm looking around for like a b or a box oh well
[491:51.89]May have found something.
[491:54.90]Come on over here.
[491:55.64]I just saw it.
[492:04.26]That's a very dangerous part.
[492:05.30]You shouldn't be doing that.
[492:08.91]Okay.
[492:09.99]Bee gonna appear?
[492:16.29]No bee, no box.
[492:20.98]They should make a Simpsons TV show.
[492:24.27]These are some really interesting characters.
[492:35.32]Uh, is there a box on the boat?
[492:41.54]I'm kind of up here for no reason, aren't I?
[492:50.35]It's very funny.
[492:51.01]I appreciate that, thank you.
[492:55.59]I tried as hard as I could.
[492:56.60]Okay, well, I guess there's nothing here.
[493:22.35]That was a gag.
[493:23.19]Well, that was a bug.
[493:24.67]Hm.
[494:03.00]I see a box down here.
[494:07.04]But what about over here?
[494:07.76]There's one down here.
[494:15.51]Nope.
[494:17.19]Here is the rest of the money that I'll probably need for the rest of the game.
[494:19.76]Maybe.
[494:19.92]Depends on how much longer it is.
[494:34.88]Maybe I should stockpile a little bit.
[494:39.14]Just so I can have it, so I don't have to take time out.
[494:41.80]Because there's another way to go over there.
[494:47.06]Let me just take a look back here.
[494:50.84]Nothing.
[494:51.12]Okay.
[494:56.31]Out in the lip.
[495:06.26]What the hell are you doing, Bart?
[495:08.68]Seven, twelve.
[495:09.30]Okay.
[495:10.06]Uh, I'm thinking top of the lighthouse.
[495:37.68]You know, I'm thinking top of the lighthouse.
[495:39.14]Let's do it.
[495:44.80]First let me get these.
[495:45.58]Can I play this at x2 speed?
[495:52.49]Uh, I need this money.
[496:08.29]I gotta have this money.
[496:13.40]I'm definitely gonna need it.
[496:16.90]It's gonna happen at some point.
[496:26.06]Really?
[496:26.44]There's something up here?
[496:27.44]Did I already do something up here?
[496:39.69]Nothing.
[496:46.38]Well, at least I have enough to keep going.
[496:47.62]I think I'm just going to jump off the edge.
[496:53.94]No, that costs money.
[496:54.38]Climb up that red arch.
[496:55.40]Well, there's another box right here.
[497:10.46]Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat...
[497:21.46]So what do I need? Armored truck?
[497:26.46]What else have you got?
[497:32.46]I need something else.
[497:35.46]Uhhhh, hello?
[497:39.72]Hello, drivers.
[497:40.66]Got a little situation here.
[497:48.25]Wrong guy.
[497:49.09]I need to get out of here.
[498:10.44]Oh, my nose.
[498:11.46]Okay.
[498:14.60]I don't know why my nose is bothering me so much.
[498:18.73]My nose into my throat.
[498:19.79]I've just been super dry and shit.
[498:22.13]This is really annoying.
[498:23.65]Alright, no house.
[498:37.91]Alright, Krusty Studio is... Krusty Studio is not... Is it down there?
[498:45.49]Where is Krusty Studio?
[498:47.27]It's down here to the right, isn't it?
[499:05.99]Eat asphalt, asphalt eaters.
[499:08.14]Why would you like a newspaper upside your head?
[499:14.40]Isn't this where I was before?
[499:18.83]Hey, eyes on the road, jerk.
[499:21.95]Am I out of my fucking mind?
[499:23.11]What the fuck is that?
[499:24.85]It's past the boat.
[499:25.65]Slow down.
[499:28.84]Don't have a cow, man.
[499:34.33]I'm not crazy.
[499:35.29]It's all the way back there.
[499:36.69]Alright.
[499:46.17]I have enough money to buy the thing from Stinky, whatever his name is.
[499:52.77]Hey, Kearney.
[499:53.61]I need to do a lot of collateral damage in the minimum amount of time.
[499:57.43]I've got just the thing.
[499:58.86]I've got a car that was owned by a supervillain.
[500:02.50]He used it to conquer the East Coast.
[500:07.54]Welbeck's supervillain car.
[500:08.80]Okay.
[500:13.40]Destroy all the free laser stands in Springfield before time runs out.
[500:24.72]Let's see.
[500:27.00]One out of... There's a placement on that one.
[500:33.08]These are just trying to fuck with you, aren't they?
[500:44.13]Watch out!
[500:57.18]Watch it, buddy!
[500:58.24]Whoa, got it!
[500:59.29]Charlie Horse!
[501:00.27]Charlie Horse!
[501:00.91]They don't give you much time, do they?
[501:04.79]Time to lay some rubber down!
[501:08.19]It's all good.
[501:20.09]Hmm.
[501:42.61]Get out of the... What are you doing there?
[501:44.69]What are you doing there?
[501:46.45]What are you doing there?
[501:47.41]Why would you be there?
[501:48.87]Got lucky on that one.
[502:16.02]Come on, Krusty's... The stupid lip.
[502:19.55]The lip just fucked me over so bad.
[502:21.63]I can't even see.
[502:22.37]The smoke is everywhere.
[502:36.09]There's no way I did this in time.
[502:39.53]I am... I need, like, another 45 seconds.
[502:43.31]How on Earth... I need, like, another 20 seconds to do that.
[502:52.76]Holy shit, this is... You gotta be perfect and go full speed.
[502:58.02]Oh my god, people are giving a ton of money.
[503:01.04]Uh, Fitty just gave 100 bucks.
[503:03.14]Two $50 donations back-to-back.
[503:07.71]Alright, I'm going to do this right now.
[503:09.79]Fitty, this is for you.
[503:11.63]They say, hey germs, I meant to get some sleep before the stream, but I accidentally slept for almost 10 hours straight.
[503:17.86]I rushed out to bed to check if he was still alive and accidentally full-on kicked this bucket of bits with my little toe.
[503:24.14]My eyes were filling with tears, so I almost stumbled into my walk-in oven and locked myself in.
[503:29.45]These bits almost killed me, so please take them.
[503:32.63]I'm really sorry about that.
[503:35.48]Thank you again, Fitty, for your 100 fucking dollars.
[503:39.38]Total.
[503:41.14]Also, when buying these last bits, Twitch told me there was an error with the transaction, and that I should try again.
[503:47.12]That error was apparently a lie, and now I bought them twice.
[503:50.76]Don't worry, I did have enough money for that.
[503:53.90]Might just be a while before I donate again.
[503:59.54]That's, well, uh, that's a $50 error.
[504:05.47]I will gladly take it.
[504:07.65]Thank you.
[504:11.87]Thank you so much, Fitty.
[504:15.51]Uh, 10 hours.
[504:18.56]Chicken wings?
[504:19.14]No, triple cheeseburgers tonight on me.
[504:22.20]This one's for you, Fitty.
[504:23.00]You ready?
[504:23.30]Watch it.
[504:23.56]Go!
[504:29.79]No, do it again.
[504:45.41]I... I fucked it up.
[504:47.61]I need every second.
[504:53.23]Is that supposed to be a penis or something?
[504:54.79]Hold on a second.
[504:55.47]Is that a dick?
[504:56.45]Is that a dick thing that they're doing?
[504:57.65]A penis thing they're doing?
[504:59.68]Oh, no, it's a laser.
[505:00.80]Right.
[505:01.00]Okay.
[505:01.22]This one's for you, Fideo.
[505:02.70]Get this one right here.
[505:06.28]Okay.
[505:30.18]Alright, I can make one mistake like that how the fuck are you supposed to get that one?
[505:32.98]You need to do a tail drift into that thing Fine by me that thing's tucked so deeply into the end whatever
[506:00.01]I don't get how it's possible to get that.
[506:01.55]I don't understand.
[506:03.67]Yeah, it's got to be a perfect drift, apparently.
[506:05.31]I don't know.
[506:07.81]Thanks.
[506:08.33]Thanks a lot for ruining everything, police.
[506:33.84]I can't imagine trying to speedrun this game and getting to this part.
[506:38.27]How many thousands of times do you have to do this before you get it perfect?
[506:46.07]No.
[506:58.69]I'm so focused on getting the one that's in the corner.
[507:11.54]Watch it, buddy.
[507:29.99]I... I'm gonna ghosty blow it.
[507:34.61]Of course.
[507:34.93]Hey, thanks a lot.
[507:37.05]Thanks a lot, cops that should not be in the game.
[507:41.20]Thanks a lot.
[507:41.62]Appreciate it.
[507:56.57]Bart Simpson at your service.
[508:24.98]Ah!
[508:51.93]Oh my god, you have to go on the wrong side of the fucking road to get these!
[508:56.31]It's just, how are you reliably supposed to do that?
[509:03.36]Jesus Christ.
[509:07.56]You gotta, you have to go on the, I...
[509:26.20]A 10-year-old is supposed to beat this game?
[509:27.94]No.
[509:28.60]No, this game is designed for, like, people that I don't even know who it's designed for.
[509:38.55]Oh.
[509:50.78]You made for fans of the show?
[509:52.58]What?
[509:52.98]No way.
[509:56.08]Bingo!
[509:57.26]It's time for some road games.
[509:59.30]I'm just going to try and finish it.
[510:00.62]No, I'm not.
[510:05.96]You got it.
[510:21.64]Didn't get it again.
[510:28.40]Just don't hit people.
[510:33.22]I do.
[510:37.41]I'm stuck in a fucking infinite time loop, Bart.
[510:42.11]Collecting popcorn machines.
[510:54.88]Fucking pumped into it.
[510:55.86]Like trying to avoid the people and you bump into a fucking trash can.
[511:01.16]Now I know why you guys wanted me to play this game.
[511:04.03]Because you wanted me to play this game because you know that this shit is going to make me scream.
[511:09.77]This is why this is the most requested game.
[511:16.35]Now I figured it out.
[511:17.41]I get it.
[511:22.88]Fine by me.
[511:24.96]You wanted to watch me drive with a minute and 40 seconds to run through the fucking claw machines.
[511:42.94]Whoa, got him.
[511:52.03]I'm trying to not hit these people, but they're just all in the way and I have to get the police after me every time.
[512:04.74]Oh, man.
[512:08.93]I have to check in again.
[512:10.67]And someone just wrote, this game fucking sucks.
[512:14.81]Ugh.
[512:16.86]Oh, man, that sucks.
[512:18.52]I always love looking over and seeing it.
[512:21.05]It makes me laugh.
[512:22.19]I got the... Yeah, open the door, please.
[512:29.29]Bring it on, fuckers.
[512:30.54]Nice one.
[512:35.40]Am I still in the bath?
[512:36.36]Yeah.
[512:37.50]The water level has gone down about 60%.
[512:39.14]I think I've absorbed osmosis.
[512:43.41]The water... My skin is just sagging down and I can lift it up and there's water in it and shit.
[512:51.19]Oh, the fucking sirens are blowing my brains out here!
[512:55.27]They're just like, I can't even hear myself dream!
[513:18.62]Pops again.
[513:27.63]It's right here!
[513:32.71]No!
[513:41.49]I want to pause it just for a little bit, just for a second, because I really want to bring this up.
[513:45.02]This is really important.
[513:46.30]The first time I was going to come back, I wanted to tell this story, because it's just horrible.
[513:52.53]And I was like, I've got to tell it as soon as I get back.
[513:56.47]I was just sitting there for the last five minutes or so, just checking on everything.
[513:59.70]so um those who know that I was taking uh cbd for pain right I'm sorry I just have to tell us I was taking cbd for pain I had a little tincture that it was cbd thc and I was doing this and you know you try to find the right dose that oh does that make my pain better I mean that one kind of does it'd be like oh let's say three milligrams four milligrams
[514:25.22]So it got to a point where I was... I may have done enough to become a little bit on the high side, right?
[514:32.46]I did too much for what I was looking for.
[514:35.68]And I was lying in bed, and I had my iPad in my hands.
[514:41.00]And I'm lying down watching a video.
[514:43.57]And I'm not kidding.
[514:46.75]I could tell when I needed to drop the CBD dose a little bit when I tried to press...
[514:54.84]The iPad on the bottom right corner of the screen, you know the little square that's on YouTube videos?
[515:01.55]I was trying to press the bottom right of my screen to expand the iPad up in my entire peripheral vision.
[515:11.27]I was like, oh, I'm going to have to hit the full screen button so it takes up my whole peripheral.
[515:17.85]Like, this is a window that I'm looking at here.
[515:20.95]And then when I realized what I was doing, I was thinking that I was trying to do that, is when I said, Yeah, it's time to reduce this.
[515:27.99]We gotta go down like two milligrams.
[515:32.54]I started laughing my ass off, though, because it's like I'm trying to expand the wind.
[515:37.60]Imagine like holding the iPad in front of you and thinking you could expand it into your entire field of view by pressing the square on the bottom right.
[515:48.85]There you go.
[515:49.59]And I've since reduced it.
[515:50.71]But, you know, I've got plenty of stories for you when I come back.
[515:55.21]Wow, dude, that's really deep.
[515:58.58]I'm not trying... I'm not trying to be deep.
[516:02.70]Hey, I haven't, like, talked to you, like, three and a half weeks.
[516:06.72]Cool, play the video, stupid.
[516:08.38]Alright, good.
[516:11.51]I'm not even supposed to be here.
[516:12.85]You're right.
[516:13.33]Alright.
[516:14.41]Look, I'm trying to, like, I'm trying to make, alleviate the situation because the next, like, fucking hour is the worst of me.
[516:23.15]So, you know, I'm just trying to alleviate.
[516:25.20]I'm trying to make myself look better.
[516:27.08]Go ahead.
[516:27.40]Crash into some more fucking walls.
[516:29.24]There's a shortcut.
[516:30.52]Oh.
[516:31.24]Oh.
[516:31.82]Oh my god.
[516:32.80]Oh.
[516:42.52]Take that!
[516:43.76]Take that!
[516:45.72]Take that!
[516:48.08]Take that!
[516:50.64]Take that!
[517:12.02]You mean there's more?
[517:15.60]No, Bart.
[517:17.15]We've lived through this life before.
[517:18.83]Watch the master.
[517:23.13]This is too cool for school.
[517:24.87]You killed me.
[517:31.21]You think I'm scared?
[517:37.18]You thought wrong.
[517:43.93]Jeremy, please.
[517:45.57]You have it.
[517:46.39]It's right here.
[517:47.37]I didn't even get the wrench.
[518:00.28]I gotta go up the jump, don't I?
[518:09.74]You better run.
[518:10.98]You haven't seen the last of me.
[518:13.76]You almost hit a person.
[518:21.67]Not again.
[518:23.99]The guy's gonna explode.
[518:26.35]The guy's gonna explode.
[518:51.46]Do you- you have to take the shortcut on the beach, otherwise it's physically not possible to complete this mission.
[518:58.09]Right?
[518:59.73]But you have to go down on the beach, or this- this is just- it will not ever happen.
[519:12.97]Fucking video games, man.
[519:15.17]I swear to God.
[519:17.09]Fucking video games.
[519:36.72]It's all good.
[519:39.35]What is this placement of cars?
[519:41.03]Whoa, wicked.
[519:49.43]This sucks.
[519:50.52]Mine.
[519:51.24]All mine.
[519:53.62]Again, the same guy.
[519:55.22]Same guy just sitting parked on the corner.
[519:57.88]Not even on the road.
[519:58.64]That's totally awesome.
[520:02.63]Out of the way, wannabe.
[520:05.51]Alright, on the beach.
[520:06.47]Here we go.
[520:08.61]You dumbass.
[520:14.41]Oh my fucking god, why are these... Why are the police in the fucking game?
[520:22.80]Why are they in the game?
[520:25.06]They don't serve a purpose!
[520:28.08]It's just to be annoying!
[520:55.65]If I didn't get crushed by the police officer going 200 miles per hour...
[521:08.25]Did the people that made this fucking level... ...have, like, a fucking bot complete it before they... ...pushed it through?
[521:16.58]You know what I mean?
[521:18.48]Did they just run an algorithm that, like, completed the level?
[521:21.42]They're like, yeah, that's good.
[521:26.73]Hey, did the bot make it with one second left?
[521:28.71]Yeah, that's fine.
[521:29.39]That still looks good.
[521:31.25]Good shit.
[521:33.45]I love... God, I love this show.
[521:38.43]Oh, that was so cool.
[521:40.63]Eat my dust, dust eaters.
[521:42.75]Watch the master.
[521:44.73]Remember the time when Homer got stuck in a dunk tank?
[522:12.86]It's alright, you get the same amount of time.
[522:16.42]Alright, here we go.
[522:17.45]We missed the fucking wrench.
[522:29.70]Almost blew it there with that stupid RNG of when is the thing gonna close.
[522:37.84]I shouldn't enjoy this so much.
[522:39.88]I tried.
[522:40.84]Oh, man.
[522:41.64]I wanted to go down on the beach.
[522:42.94]But the thing is, how do you even determine where you're going to end up?
[522:46.55]I didn't do it.
[522:57.60]I'll have to go through the boat too, don't I?
[522:59.54]I don't even remember.
[523:02.16]I need to look at where that shortcut is because it's... You have to be perfect and use every fucking shortcut.
[523:08.88]You have to be perfect and use every shortcut.
[523:10.70]Where is it?
[523:16.08]I need to go look at it because when you're driving a thousand miles per hour and there's shit happening all around you, I can't pay attention to all that stuff at the same time.
[523:23.51]Like, where is it?
[523:36.42]I need to go I'm just gonna I need to go look at it because this is this is like outrageous Even if I fail I just want to see where it is No worries
[524:10.20]I almost had it that other time too, but I didn't get screwed over.
[524:21.28]Don't run people over.
[524:22.48]You know how difficult it is to do that?
[524:24.28]And collect everything in 1 minute and 40 seconds?
[524:31.80]That's almost impossible.
[524:32.88]Oh my god.
[524:35.16]Why?
[524:35.30]Why?
[524:35.40]Why?
[524:35.56]God.
[524:35.66]The three dumb motherfucking sedans.
[524:41.55]Why are you?
[524:41.99]And what the heck?
[524:59.83]And I went over the... How the fuck is that even possible?
[525:03.96]I went over the wrench.
[525:06.68]I don't even... I need to go look at this shit.
[525:09.00]I need to go see... Oh my god, this is unbearable.
[525:16.23]No mission in the whole game is compared to how horrible this is.
[525:22.05]I don't even care if I lose.
[525:23.51]I need to go look at this.
[525:25.33]Where is this shortcut?
[525:27.62]Where is it?
[525:30.38]This way?
[525:30.79]I can't even see.
[525:31.83]I was this close.
[525:41.50]I went down it like three times.
[525:45.08]It's just rage.
[525:46.38]It's just rage takes over your brain.
[525:48.68]And you don't... You can't even see colors anymore.
[525:51.62]How do they expect people to reliably do this?
[525:55.86]When you get to be like this upset about something, it's just like the world closes in.
[526:02.38]Hey!
[526:10.79]And it only gets worse from here?
[526:14.31]You mean there's more?
[526:19.93]You know, I don't give a shit about any of this stuff going on right now.
[526:23.85]I'm going to quit the mission.
[526:25.07]And I'm going to go find this exact route to take to do the jump.
[526:29.65]Bingo!
[526:31.75]Where is it?
[526:32.47]Whoa, got him.
[526:37.58]Hey, he's on the road, jerk.
[526:42.00]I need to, like... Where's that, like, spot?
[526:58.09]So somebody said the boat is closed.
[527:00.15]The boat is closed.
[527:02.03]So I can't even do it in the... So why is everybody screaming at me to do this if I can't even do it in the first place?
[527:10.22]Is that for real?
[527:11.86]It is for real.
[527:16.76]Oh, this is too cool for school.
[527:18.78]It's not closed.
[527:24.92]Oh man, this sucks.
[527:26.52]No, no, no, no.
[527:27.40]Wait, wait, wait.
[527:28.16]No.
[527:32.23]I need to see how this connects.
[527:36.79]Watch it, buddy.
[527:41.54]There's the jump.
[527:43.00]But where's the direct route from where I come off of?
[527:48.14]Not that way.
[527:49.70]So I gotta bang a left once I get to here.
[527:54.96]Or is it a left?
[527:56.86]It's this little corner.
[527:58.18]What direction do I come from?
[528:06.56]Spray through here, and then you bang a right.
[528:13.38]This starts down here Once you get to this with that dude up there I Get it I get it the yeah you put you put these people in the game because a Grand Theft Auto and you thought it would be great I Need to I need to get out of the car so I can see I
[528:42.48]I'm gonna look up.
[528:43.82]That's where the phone booth is.
[528:52.54]So I gotta take... go straight, and then bang a right.
[529:00.48]Once I get to this portion here.
[529:08.23]Because I'm gonna be coming from this way, right?
[529:12.48]So if I'm going to be coming from this way, then it is just straight through where the ketchup guy is.
[529:17.86]Right through the boat.
[529:26.72]There's a way to go through here, too.
[529:34.65]There's a way to go through here.
[529:35.67]And then it's hard to figure out how to turn right.
[529:37.81]No, what you're watching is you're watching somebody confirm over and over and over again.
[529:41.03]And what they're about to do is a good idea.
[529:44.13]So there's an alley right here.
[529:46.81]You're watching somebody so desperately confirm over and over again.
[529:50.67]And then you bang a left and then a right.
[529:54.71]Because I was trying to memorize everything.
[529:57.19]This is like teaching a five-year-old shapes.
[530:01.40]You know what I mean?
[530:01.96]Like, okay, right, left, right.
[530:03.92]Then I go this way, and then I go right, and then I go straight.
[530:07.02]Then I go right, and then I go straight.
[530:09.66]The base level.
[530:17.43]Alright, so that's where you land.
[530:21.67]This is where you land from the jump.
[530:23.43]Forget about the beach.
[530:26.36]So it's just right there.
[530:30.91]And then here.
[530:31.49]And then here.
[530:34.07]Alright.
[530:41.97]I got it.
[530:45.63]Just land.
[530:48.83]Right there.
[530:49.27]Alright.
[530:50.60]I got it.
[530:50.92]Let's fucking go.
[530:54.84]I have to go back to Krusty's lab, right?
[530:58.08]I'm gonna do that.
[531:03.11]I'm gonna smash right into it.
[531:06.03]Test the boat, just to make sure?
[531:07.41]Oh, that's a good call.
[531:14.77]I didn't really go that fast.
[531:15.74]Where do you end up after this?
[531:17.64]You end up right here.
[531:22.60]Oh, that saves a fucking dickload of time.
[531:33.36]Alright, Krusty.
[531:35.84]Fuck you.
[531:39.01]You face me this way, how would you die?
[531:47.67]How would you die?
[531:50.67]I'm surprised there's still 3,200 people here watching me fail at a fucking popcorn collection again.
[531:56.29]Thanks for sticking around and dealing with my fucking rage.
[532:01.47]I hope you're having a good time.
[532:04.47]Restart.
[532:05.01]I don't even... Why?
[532:09.77]Restart.
[532:10.45]No, no.
[532:10.95]Guys, we didn't tell Grandpa... I don't care about this.
[532:12.91]I can do this.
[532:13.69]We didn't tell Grandpa how many people were watching.
[532:15.35]We didn't want him to feel self-conscious.
[532:17.11]The problem is, once you get the 49 seconds, 50 seconds... This is not a problem at all.
[532:24.07]It's just... I need to now do the... I didn't do it.
[532:32.57]holy shit 200 people watching wow that's a lot I better be good yeah you're doing good you're gonna drive into oncoming traffic I mean it's just like stupid dust eaters I'll be fair though it is oh I just I don't even care about this just get me up to where I was and I got chunked it's okay
[533:01.66]Okay.
[533:03.14]Here we go.

[533:15.41]Here we go.
[533:20.15]Thank you for ripping out of the way.
[533:21.59]He knew.
[533:22.05]That was somebody in chat.
[533:23.29]It's time for some road games.
[533:27.01]Bart Simpson style.
[533:30.46]What was that?

[534:27.47]Beach shortcut instead?
[534:28.69]No, let me try this again.
[534:29.63]Where I... Oy vey.
[534:36.18]I can imagine being, like, 13.
[534:39.00]And crying at this game.
[534:43.27]And not understanding what was wrong.
[534:46.76]Like, tears streaming down my face.
[534:48.28]Because I don't get why I can't win the game, Mom.
[534:51.32]What's up?
[534:52.38]Take that!
[534:53.84]Watch it, buddy!
[534:57.35]You think I'm scared?
[535:03.39]Thought wrong.
[535:03.99]Eat asphalt, asphalt eaters.
[535:05.53]No biggie.
[535:16.77]Hold on, wait for the fucking gong to hit.
[535:22.60]Whatever the hell that thing is.
[535:25.10]Probably some reference.
[535:28.36]Everyone homer.
[535:32.40]Alright, stop.
[535:33.82]I'm so glad I went over that.
[535:49.28]Okay.
[535:50.74]Now slow it down.
[535:57.72]No!
[535:59.84]Oh my god!
[536:01.12]Why, in the name of God, do you have to do this to me?
[536:06.58]You have to go straight in.
[536:08.92]It's actually hard to do that.
[536:12.02]It's actually hard to do that.
[536:14.94]That is as wide as this car is.
[536:19.09]That's as wide as the car?
[536:20.99]Oh my fucking god.
[536:26.49]I'm gonna get out there and fucking just crawl.
[536:34.41]Oh, I'm so... I'm turning into ice right now.
[536:41.41]I can just feel my body cooling.
[536:46.20]Like the devil is taking over.
[536:54.69]I can't skip it because I know this sucks, but I have to do this It's as wide as the car Oh Satan leave me Satan leave me now It's all good
[537:23.44]I'm never gonna watch The Simpsons on Netflix.
[537:31.45]Ever.
[537:47.42]Oh, you're never getting a view from me on Netflix!
[537:57.72]Hohoho!
[538:16.95]Oh my god, you understand this, right?
[538:21.96]Look at this.
[538:25.06]It's actually going to be just a stroke of luck for me to fit in there.
[538:31.52]No problemo.
[538:34.61]beach, go on the beach.
[538:35.49]No, everyone told me to do this.
[538:37.55]Everybody said, Jeremy, you gotta go through the alley.
[538:39.77]Try the alley and then try the boat.
[538:41.47]I know you guys are trying to help me out.
[538:42.93]I really appreciate it.
[538:44.01]I do, but I'm trying.
[538:49.16]I'm trying.
[538:50.04]First we're gonna try the beach, now we try the boat.
[538:53.06]I do appreciate it.
[538:54.30]I do.
[538:54.58]Thank you.
[538:56.36]But... Satan, leave me.
[539:08.06]Begone Satan!
[539:21.20]ignore the alley but my puny six-year-old brain that's the only thing I know what to do now I don't know how to do anything else right now it's just to just go to that alleyway and go through that's the only thing my brain can do
[539:42.60]Okay, hold on.
[539:43.16]I'm gonna get it now.
[539:44.82]I'm gonna get it now.
[539:45.50]I'll get it now.
[539:46.20]Right now.
[539:46.76]Just gotta hit every single tree on the way over there.
[539:49.72]Here we go.
[539:51.24]Relax.
[539:52.02]No cops.
[539:54.19]I'll get it.
[539:55.51]I promise.
[539:55.87]Or I'm gonna do 500 push-ups.
[539:57.95]Fuck!
[540:16.67]I didn't do it.
[540:21.69]I got it.
[540:22.13]I got it.
[540:22.47]I got it.
[540:22.65]I got it.
[540:22.95]I got it.
[540:23.19]I got it.
[540:23.46]I got it.
[540:23.72]I got it.
[540:24.02]I got it.
[540:34.82]It's time for some road rage, Bart Simpson style.
[540:39.00]Eat asphalt, asphalt eaters.
[540:41.38]Come on, just a few more seconds.
[541:03.39]You've had it.
[541:05.45]Don't... I... That didn't count, because the 500 push-ups, only if I fuck up.
[541:11.99]That didn't count.
[541:13.41]That doesn't count as a fuck-up for me.
[541:14.81]That counts as a fuck-up from the video game, dropping the school paper cutter on me.
[541:22.40]That didn't count as a fuck-up either.
[541:23.42]He's not a fuck-up yet.
[541:43.40]I just got it off the rails.
[541:47.18]Skip one.
[541:48.46]Skip one of the popcorns.
[541:50.95]What do you mean skip a popcorn?
[541:53.43]Is it more than 25?
[541:54.79]Beach.
[541:59.61]Alright, I'm gonna go beach this time.
[542:15.26]I'm gonna go for the beach, but I don't know where it ends up.
[542:19.00]I'm gonna play calm.
[542:20.16]You understand?
[542:21.66]I'm calm.
[542:23.16]I just gotta get up there.
[542:24.18]I got plenty of time.
[542:26.30]I'm gonna fucking start.
[542:27.68]I'm gonna start slamming things.
[542:29.78]No.
[542:30.28]Stay calm.
[542:32.20]I'm not even gonna get him.
[542:38.17]Nice one.
[542:38.59]Alright.
[542:38.85]That was so cool.
[542:41.37]This is a really
[542:45.69]stay calm time to lay some rubber down you mean there's more jump to light speed
[543:26.01]It's always right there!
[543:30.95]I can get it.
[543:52.11]Why is this game so hard?
[543:54.25]Why is this game like this?
[543:57.06]Is this one of those secret hard games?
[543:59.32]Tell me the truth.
[544:00.32]This is one of those secret hard games, right?
[544:03.28]Where the game is... Holy shit, it's secret hard game.
[544:08.20]Right?
[544:08.50]It is?
[544:09.36]Please?
[544:10.40]Please, tell me.
[544:12.24]This game was made for children.
[544:18.62]Stop that.
[544:20.42]Enough of that.
[544:22.10]How am I doing that?
[544:23.46]How is the car doing this?
[544:27.66]I need a fresh start here.
[544:34.90]Skip number 22.
[544:35.56]Skip 22.
[544:35.84]Thank you for the help.
[544:40.21]Skip 22.
[544:40.59]I'll try.
[544:40.89]I'm going to skip 22.
[544:55.34]It's the one that comes after 21.
[544:57.60]Goodbye, cruel world.
[545:19.59]Who did that?
[545:20.67]Who said that?
[545:22.11]18, 19 20 21 But 22 is right here!
[545:23.03]22 is easy to get!
[545:51.93]Alright.
[545:56.61]It's not gonna... No, no, because look, when I activate the next part, when I get the 25th one, it just goes to 50 seconds.
[546:03.07]I don't think it matters when you pick C-Watch.
[546:05.57]Ready?
[546:06.79]50, right?
[546:07.99]It's not like it matters when I pick them up.
[546:12.18]Never mind not getting this somehow.
[546:28.99]This is the one.
[546:29.59]This is the one.
[546:30.75]Again, this is the one.
[547:00.44]Nice driving, man.
[547:01.42]I think I just seltzered myself.
[547:12.07]Why didn't I just do this in the first place?
[547:14.57]Why didn't I know that showgirl last night was a guy?
[547:18.21]Hindsight's always 20-20.
[547:19.83]That was for you, Feedy.
[547:21.88]45 minutes ago.
[547:31.16]For the record, 20, skipping 22, what would it do?
[547:33.72]There's more to this game.
[547:39.98]What the fuck do you want me to do now?
[547:47.77]I wasn't paying attention.
[547:50.37]Save, save, save, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[547:57.79]Save for the love of God.
[547:58.81]Okay, why?
[547:59.47]Is there a problem here?
[548:01.10]You get 22 last on the way back resetting the timer.
[548:05.47]Oh.
[548:09.17]You're all mine.
[548:10.95]What is this?
[548:14.97]Is it in the studio?
[548:15.81]Where is this person?
[548:22.15]I don't remember him to get this much exercise.
[548:24.87]Maybe.
[548:25.27]OK.
[548:34.58]Six IQ Boomer doesn't believe this chat.
[548:36.86]No, that's not what I'm saying!
[548:39.67]I didn't know that it... Look, I didn't know it was the super cheat exploit way to do it.
[548:43.71]That's an exploit.
[548:45.37]I read on the Wikipedia page for Simpsons Hit and Run that the developers were really upset that people were doing the Collect 22 last.
[548:53.84]because it fucked with their, only bots can complete this algorithm.
[548:58.11]So, I mean, I'm sorry, but that's what I read.
[549:19.73]No.
[549:21.31]I was thinking about it.
[549:22.57]No, not at this stage.
[549:23.49]I got one more mission.
[549:27.40]Okay, hold on a minute.
[549:29.16]Like three hours ago, somebody said I had two more missions.
[549:33.75]There's been probably 14 missions.
[549:46.99]Two more levels.
[549:48.51]Two more chapters.
[549:53.86]Hold on.
[549:58.12]Finally, it's $21.
[549:58.46]God, Jerma is fucking... axing.
[549:59.78]What's up?
[550:31.41]Race the aliens.
[550:36.37]Oh, amazing.
[550:37.25]Oh, thank you.
[550:38.65]I appreciate that.
[550:48.07]This car sucks bullshit.
[550:49.78]It does.
[550:50.14]This car su- This car is bullshit.
[550:52.68]This car sucks, is what I'm trying to say.
[550:57.25]Ow, my ass.
[550:58.63]I hope that was expensive.
[551:01.91]What?
[551:04.23]Look out.
[551:07.99]I regret nothing.
[551:09.69]I'm a lean, mean speed thingy.
[551:12.95]Eat my dust, dust eater.
[551:27.86]Why does it put me in front of this lip?
[551:34.43]Why would you do this to me?
[551:35.87]This thing goes up on two wheels so easily.
[551:55.62]And that guy's blocking the secret.
[551:58.14]He's doing that.
[551:58.88]You see what I'm talking about?
[551:59.88]I had a choice.
[552:01.52]Homer, shut the fuck up!
[552:13.80]Homer, shut up!
[552:14.68]Stop it!
[552:15.36]Stop it, Homer!
[552:33.55]He's breaking.
[552:34.29]No, he's not.
[552:35.09]He's fine.
[552:35.73]He's doing just fine.
[552:41.01]It's not the line that gets me.
[552:42.31]It's the... He just said, learn to drive, dumbass.
[552:46.10]I ain't never watching your show.
[552:54.24]I heard it's a classic American piece of television.
[552:56.48]No, I ain't watching it.
[552:58.02]Why did I do the same thing you just did?
[553:07.27]We're doing the same things.
[553:10.05]Why didn't I just pass you?
[553:24.02]I'm gonna lose.
[553:26.64]He crashes into that thing every time.
[553:28.22]I just need to go around it.
[553:29.06]But it's hard to go around it because the beach is not desirable ground.
[553:36.33]Sweet!
[553:37.89]Fine by me!
[553:41.64]I have no insurance!
[553:44.60]Hope that didn't break my memory card.
[553:53.54]Nothing lasts forever.
[553:57.26]Somebody go the other way at the start, and I listen to him.
[553:59.64]Let's do this thing!
[554:01.12]No problemo!
[554:02.22]Stay on target!
[554:03.18]Stay on target!
[554:04.24]Let's do this thing!
[554:06.00]Hey, you were supposed to eat my dust!
[554:13.70]That guy braked.
[554:15.00]He braked at the worst possible time.
[554:21.19]Hey, what's up with that?
[554:27.02]He'll fuck it up, don't worry.
[554:28.04]He always does.
[554:28.54]I'm going over the edge.
[554:32.99]I'm going over.
[554:34.37]No I'm not, no I'm not.
[554:35.25]Just go around him.
[554:37.61]Crashes every time went around and this is where I win He just he his character just as now look at how much faster his car is right now He just goes 5,000 miles per hour in five seconds, and I lose again Look at how much faster the car is
[555:04.49]From crashing into the wall, he goes 80.
[555:26.46]it's crushing time at your service damn it I dropped my kebab
[555:41.96]See, he's always faster than me, so he always causes a fucking bunch of shit in front of me.
[555:46.02]This is an unfair race.
[555:48.65]It's not even a race.
[555:49.41]It's, hey, I'm just gonna go in front of you and crash into everything, and then you're gonna have to deal with the outcome.
[555:54.83]I'm ahead of him.
[555:58.55]Oh, he... Yes!
[556:02.56]He's not even... Don't do it.
[556:05.04]Go.
[556:05.54]Down to the beach.
[556:06.32]Down to the beach.
[556:08.36]There's no way he's catching up.
[556:09.94]He fucked up.
[556:11.28]Bad.
[556:12.67]Discompose yourself.
[556:17.50]I win.
[556:18.38]I did it.
[556:21.36]Mistakes were made.
[556:22.38]How?
[556:29.22]Oh, I win.
[556:29.74]Oh, yeah.
[556:33.62]Where's the finish line?
[556:34.40]OK.
[556:34.52]Alright.
[556:35.60]That was so cool.
[556:46.10]I told you to do that five minutes ago while I wasn't looking.
[556:48.94]This game sucks.
[557:22.26]That's just somebody wrote, uh, I... Oh, this is fucking hilarious.
[557:41.10]What a stream, man.
[557:42.08]I went from, like, fun to...
[557:45.41]to joking, to anger, to now I'm, this, I'm fucking, this is hilarious to me.
[557:53.26]It's not done?
[557:54.52]This is DLC.
[557:55.22]This is a Halloween DLC.
[557:56.30]I don't have to do this.
[558:02.77]Hey, thank, I beat the game.
[558:04.05]This is the fucking Halloween skeleton DLC.
[558:12.73]Dad, the zombies are on the way.
[558:14.73]Shouldn't we do something?
[558:16.55]No, Lisa, I'm trying to listen to the baseball game.
[558:19.45]It's the top of the seventh and... Oh, God!
[558:22.23]Zombies!
[558:23.03]They're devouring the crowd!
[558:24.83]Now they're eating my brain!
[558:27.30]Oh, the pain!
[558:30.28]You can tell he's mad because you haven't done any of the extra stuff like you were doing in the beginning.
[558:34.52]No, not anymore.
[558:35.32]We go through stages.
[558:43.06]Are you going to give me a time limit to go talk to Flanders?
[558:46.69]You can't do that.
[558:50.09]This is DLC.
[558:53.82]What the hell is going on?
[558:56.62]Landry, give me your first aid kit.
[558:58.56]Well, I was hoping to save it for Rotter and Totter to, you know, bandage their brain-eater boo-boos.
[559:03.72]Look, just rub a Bible on them.
[559:05.38]Will that work to fend off zombies?
[559:07.07]Who am I, Dr. Science?
[559:08.83]Oakley, Oakley, here's the first aid kit.
[559:10.69]Daddy, if the zombies are dead, why aren't they in heaven?
[559:14.75]I hope my brain feeds a poor, hungry zombie.
[559:22.19]What's with the camera?
[559:23.49]I need something to board up the window.
[559:26.05]I just threw up.
[559:26.83]I know.
[559:27.25]Oh, my god.
[559:28.21]What's the disease?
[559:29.21]I have to.
[559:33.55]Coming through.
[559:56.16]This whole thing is timed, but it's not, but it is, but it isn't, but... Where's my car?
[560:10.68]Flanders, get... I need to get my car out.
[560:12.90]Oh my, just give me the car.
[560:13.91]Just give me a car because...
[560:25.99]Why won't you... You have to have the time limit here before I even have a car.
[560:30.24]I have so many locked cars.
[560:35.44]Where's that cool one?
[560:40.17]Give me this thing.
[560:40.95]Alright, that's... Okay, that's... Can I make it from... I don't think I can make it from here.
[560:58.90]I've never even seen inside of here before.
[561:01.44]This is the first time I've seen inside the cemetery.
[561:07.80]I don't know what it looked like in here.
[561:10.16]How am I supposed to know what it looked like in there?
[561:14.04]Is the car at least there?
[561:18.21]It is.
[561:19.89]Oh my god.
[561:20.83]Talk to Flint.
[561:21.77]I need the car!
[561:28.53]Planners, zoom my camera in and make me throw up.
[561:32.83]I know, boards!
[561:49.18]I don't... Oh, I think I broke something.
[561:51.88]Okay, I know what the... I know what the inside of the cemetery looks like now.
[561:56.28]Oh my goodness.
[562:13.16]So glad to be of service.
[562:14.76]Sweet!
[562:17.11]I've been hit by more cars than anyone I know.
[562:19.87]So, how's that special class going?
[562:27.97]It's 12, how long have I been playing the game for?
[562:30.39]What?
[562:30.53]Raid?
[562:30.71]Where's the raid?
[562:31.37]Where's the raid?
[562:31.79]Where's the raid?
[562:32.39]Raid?
[562:56.07]2,200 fucking people just came in?
[562:57.25]Other side.
[562:59.29]This isn't the short bus.
[563:02.91]Holy shit.
[563:04.29]It was Nova.
[563:08.85]Oh, what's up, dude?
[563:11.36]Thanks for the free.
[563:12.82]A lot of people are probably going to leave immediately.
[563:16.30]Because I've been swearing.
[563:17.28]I've been saying bad fucking words.
[563:20.90]Like, why would that matter?
[563:24.89]I'm playing Simpsons Hit and Run and having a tough time.
[563:27.43]Do I have to do the whole thing again?
[563:39.61]Welcome everyone.
[563:40.29]No, for real.
[563:41.54]Thanks for the raid.
[563:42.70]I have to do the whole thing again?
[563:44.94]No!
[563:45.56]Why?
[563:48.86]Having a hard time playing a children's game.
[563:51.28]It's not a chil- We've come to the conclusion this is not a children's game.
[563:54.16]This is a game for... robots.
[563:58.44]Only.
[563:59.52]Because they're the only ones that can fucking complete these things.
[564:10.37]Sweet!
[564:12.38]Give me the car.
[564:15.86]There's cheat codes to drive fast?
[564:17.39]I can't do that.
[564:17.99]I gotta do it legitimately.
[564:22.97]Here we go.
[564:24.09]Flanders.
[564:25.99]Give me your first aid kit.
[564:27.91]Let's go.
[564:31.91]It's just so many tiny... There's so much small... I can't... Words are not coming out right.
[564:38.45]They're just not...
[564:41.69]That was so lucky.
[564:42.59]I can't.
[564:43.09]Words.
[564:43.29]Let's go to the secret entrance.
[564:45.09]Here we go.
[564:45.53]Alright.
[564:45.91]Done.
[564:46.09]Aim the car the correct way.
[564:48.46]I'm gonna go back this way.
[565:12.75]Here we go.
[565:13.29]I need your chainsaw.
[565:14.67]Get it.
[565:14.97]And here we go.
[565:15.93]Run!
[565:16.71]40 seconds.
[565:19.01]Get in the car!
[565:20.95]That took 5 seconds.
[565:22.21]That was not... That was a ton of time.
[565:34.44]Should've went in the cemetery.
[565:38.51]I should've gone in the cemetery.
[565:40.41]But I didn't know.
[565:48.71]It's fine, I beat it.
[565:53.13]We're good, everything's fine.
[565:55.52]Drive to the school playground.
[565:56.92]I'm driving like there's still a time limit, but there's not.
[566:01.98]I just gotta relax.
[566:09.88]No.
[566:10.02]The music is too stressful.
[566:11.12]It really is.
[566:12.00]Help Smithers find the items for Mr. Burns before the time runs out.
[566:16.54]Find the socks.
[566:39.98]First, let me walk around while my son drives.
[566:44.34]I'm dead.
[566:47.23]What's this do?
[567:07.81]T-pose.
[567:08.97]You got it.
[567:09.51]You got your T-pose after 10 hours of streaming.
[567:22.39]Here you go, Mr. Smithers.
[567:24.17]Oh, thank God.
[567:25.15]His socks have been pooling around his ankle all day.
[567:26.77]And this is his favorite brand, Alan Quartermain's Keep'em Ups.
[567:30.45]Hmm, what next?
[567:35.57]Why can't I just get them all?
[567:36.77]Why do I have to do this again?
[567:37.85]Alright, get it again.
[567:38.91]Do it again.
[568:12.32]Camera, why are you over here like this?
[568:14.38]What the f- What?
[568:15.70]And how do you- How do you get that one in 10 seconds?
[568:20.22]Nope.
[568:27.80]Drive.
[568:31.89]Optional, don't do it.
[568:32.77]Don't do it, man.
[568:41.01]Are there new costumes?
[568:43.63]That's interesting.
[568:48.47]Dirty Homer.
[568:50.55]Evil Homer.
[568:58.06]I don't like that noise.
[569:07.02]What is something that people do at the beach?
[569:11.65]Um.
[569:13.19]Uh.
[569:14.89]Eat!
[569:16.29]I say eat.
[569:19.45]That was not worth it.
[569:33.48]Mr. Smith.
[569:35.74]Sweet.
[569:40.52]I love senselessly pushing things.
[569:48.70]Here you go.
[569:50.97]Well, it's about time.
[569:52.45]You're as dumb as a bag of hair.
[569:54.49]Takes five seconds to get in the game.
[569:58.91]Nice one.
[569:59.83]Jump to light speed.
[570:07.66]Just go to the school for crying out loud.
[570:11.16]Whoa!
[570:11.78]I am Excellente!
[570:15.37]We're just gonna go to the school.
[570:27.28]We're going on ten hours here.
[570:28.42]I didn't do it.
[570:28.94]Oh, awesome, man!
[570:30.46]That was the best ride ever!
[570:37.42]Make sure I save it Okay
[571:19.79]So it was... the giant flying saucer is probably an indicator of where I need to go.
[571:40.98]But hold on.
[571:42.86]Cool.
[571:43.76]Hey, you there.
[571:44.80]Smelly Sam.
[571:45.36]What's going on?
[571:45.95]Get Homer's green car.
[571:46.77]The alien craft is using some sort of tractor beam to suck up trespassers to their doom.
[571:52.05]Worst effects ever.
[571:54.09]But that's real.
[571:55.25]Worst effects ever.
[571:57.55]What's with the cool black car?
[571:59.01]My knowledge of sci-fi movies is correct, which it is.
[572:02.62]The black car is an advanced probe for the mothership.
[572:05.66]Now, if you're through, I will spend my last hours on Earth complaining about movies on the Internet.
[572:10.56]The gift of life is wasted on you.
[572:13.26]Yes, I recommend you obtain a zombie car.
[572:15.95]It will protect you well, but it runs on human brains.
[572:20.05]Slight drawback.
[572:21.17]I got plenty of those.
[572:24.77]You need the zombie car purchased from the zombie at the Springfield Cemetery for 500 coins, or call it from a phone booth if you already have it.
[572:35.35]Well...
[572:37.49]I don't think I have that money yet.
[572:38.91]But I can go down the slide and maybe collect some cash.
[572:41.07]I think something's supposed to just scare me right there.
[572:46.72]Is there a spider there?
[573:00.98]Well, I gotta jump from here.
[573:10.61]500 I really okay.
[573:16.83]Where do I get some money?
[573:27.30]Human cookbook Can't grab the spider or anything alright look at the boxes
[573:39.97]Don't play hit and run at 3 AM.
[573:43.62]Well, I'm fairly committed.
[573:45.60]So... I'm gonna get to the end of this tonight.
[573:49.78]This might be like a 12 hour stream.
[573:52.28]If it takes that long.
[573:53.00]I'm committed.
[573:54.30]We're already here.
[573:58.09]You know, I'm sitting right here.
[574:09.46]Because I'm so close.
[574:19.28]I'm currently addicted to the game, even though it's infuriating.
[574:26.15]And I've probably lost two or three hundred hairs.
[574:30.61]Just normally, because I'm starting to lose my hair a little bit, but... I mean, it's been about 12 hours, so that's how many hairs I lose in about 10 to 12 hours.
[574:40.32]But the game's really frustrating, you know?
[574:42.22]That too.
[574:47.84]Anything else over here?
[574:53.47]I'm gonna be Homer by the end of the stream.
[574:57.41]Big money on the roof of the school.
[575:03.03]I just... Get out of the way, I want the coin that's in here.
[575:07.75]On the roof of the school, and there looks to be a place to go.
[575:12.41]Can you get up there?
[575:14.21]There's no ledge I can stay on here?
[575:17.89]Seems like it should be there.
[575:39.62]Try one more time.
[575:44.48]Got it.
[575:48.04]That was a little more difficult than it should have been.
[575:51.55]But I made it.
[575:52.75]Double jump?
[575:53.17]Yeah, I was trying to.
[575:56.07]I was pressing the input.
[575:57.19]Uh, there was one little bit.
[576:14.81]What about up here?
[576:16.73]Bug?
[576:18.79]No bug?
[576:28.10]There are a lot of boxes here.
[576:29.08]Very good.
[576:42.85]Yeah, I would have just jumped off, but I was kind of scared that there was going to be nothing underneath me.
[576:55.74]Beautiful.
[577:00.03]Still not quite there.
[577:04.36]What do these do?
[577:04.96]Can these blow you?
[577:08.46]That startled me.
[577:10.35]I knew it was going to happen, but I just, for some reason, was not expecting it.
[577:13.45]Alright.
[577:14.59]A little bit more.
[577:22.61]Is it because I'm drunk?
[577:33.04]All I've had is, I've had a Coca-Cola, a ginger ale, and water.
[577:49.48]There we go.
[577:49.92]390.
[577:49.96]I can't read that number. 394.
[578:07.96]What over here?
[578:10.96]Something over there?
[578:11.74]Probably.
[578:18.10]Can I change music tracks?
[578:20.93]Just a few more.
[578:22.33]This is giving me extra anxiety playing the game.
[578:33.17]Alright, it's... You know what?
[578:35.33]I've been... I've been on the internet for too long.
[578:38.91]That's a gnome.
[578:39.63]That's what I thought that was.
[578:41.83]I thought that was a gnome or something and somebody modded it in.
[578:47.64]But online for too long.
[578:55.70]Alright.
[578:56.36]This looks like something could be back here.
[578:58.38]Yes.
[579:02.15]Yes.
[579:06.89]440!
[579:07.97]So close.
[579:14.57]Can't get over there?
[579:15.09]Has Jerma done anything silly in the last 10 minutes, guys?
[579:32.01]I don't think so.
[579:42.39]No, I don't believe so.
[579:56.82]Well, I see a lot of shit over there.
[580:06.10]What is that thing?
[580:09.41]There's a little go-kart over there.
[580:18.36]Huh.
[580:22.16]That's not gonna knock me into the air?
[580:23.44]Do I have to jump with a car?
[580:28.36]No, I got it.
[580:29.90]Let me get this first.
[580:30.60]This thing is tiny!
[580:49.10]500?
[580:49.34]Not quite.
[580:50.82]This thing is cooler than it... How do you say the thing I'm trying to say?
[581:13.56]This thing looks cool, but...
[581:17.19]I don't know.
[581:18.15]Alright, back to where we were.
[581:25.76]I'm going to go talk to... Where was I going before?
[581:31.67]I thought I got gnomed, and that's the correct way this way, right?
[581:34.17]Nope.
[581:40.86]Nope.
[581:48.59]Cemetery?
[581:49.21]Is it on my right?
[581:56.90]No, I remember this shit.
[581:58.52]I have to go back up that way, don't I?
[582:00.64]Or do I jump?
[582:02.82]Can I jump this and get all the way back where I was?
[582:06.62]I remember this.
[582:26.72]Wrong way, wrong way, wrong... going the wrong way?
[582:28.66]Wrong way!
[582:31.33]No, I'm not.
[582:31.79]It's right here.
[582:32.21]Isn't there somebody I can buy it off of here?
[582:38.43]Eat my dust!
[582:41.09]Oh, right.
[582:42.05]Okay.
[582:42.57]No, this is just where Bart was.
[582:43.85]Woohoo!
[582:47.37]Just call me Air Homer!
[582:53.65]Mistakes were made!
[583:00.83]Brain is fried.
[583:03.79]I'm alright.
[583:04.41]I'll be good for another five minutes.
[583:07.52]Alright, cemetery.
[583:11.62]Yes, I thought that was a hill.
[583:13.14]All hills are green.
[583:14.18]I didn't do it.
[583:27.14]There's a witch up there.
[583:32.27]No, all... Yeah, all hills are... That's what I meant to say.
[583:38.34]I thought I could drive up there.
[583:44.82]Where the hell is the cemetery?
[583:47.66]I don't even know if I'm close or not.
[583:54.91]Is it back here?
[584:09.76]I'm driving in circles.
[584:12.70]Give me my blip.
[584:13.86]I just want my blip on the map.
[584:16.16]That's all I need.
[584:19.54]You passed it again.
[584:27.17]It's the thing next to the fire truck.
[584:29.51]Okay, can you please get off of me?
[584:33.53]You're not gonna get more?
[584:50.03]My brain might be too fried for this.
[584:54.24]By the fire truck.
[584:55.36]The fire truck's right here.
[585:10.01]One guy was trolling me.
[585:11.19]Alright, you ready?
[585:14.73]I'm gonna go this way.
[585:16.39]And then I'm taking a left.
[585:24.98]Yes.
[585:37.67]Wrong way?
[585:38.38]Wait, didn't you guys just say left?
[585:40.78]I said, what?
[585:42.44]Wait, hold on.
[585:45.52]Wait, what?
[585:46.86]Can't you see I'm driving here?
[585:52.02]It is left!
[585:55.74]Not the wrong way.
[586:01.80]Why wouldn't they just put an indicator on the map?
[586:04.30]They have it for everything else!
[586:05.70]Alright, I'm gonna- I'm going left here.
[586:13.05]Sure.
[586:29.70]Alright, I'm going left here.
[586:31.10]Alright.
[586:40.35]Alright, I'm going left here.
[586:59.40]Reckless driving is my pet peeve.
[587:09.51]Oh, man.
[587:13.37]See, oh, it's by the fire truck.
[587:15.75]Where's the alien car heading?
[587:28.00]No, I can't save it here.
[587:34.92]At this stage in the game, I wish they would just delete all the cards.
[587:39.32]All these people look like there's just witches flying around.
[587:41.58]There's people rowing boats on the road.
[587:52.83]Missing shortcuts.
[587:54.15]It don't even matter.
[587:54.81]I'm going to first try this mission.
[587:59.35]If I first try this mission, I'm going in the Discord and I'm going in the voice chat and I want to hear people screaming.
[588:04.61]No, that's way too late for that ship.
[588:08.76]It's like four in the morning.
[588:10.28]Hey, just checking it again.
[588:11.98]Just running some bath water.
[588:13.38]Gonna take another bath.
[588:14.56]Can you hear it?
[588:15.08]Follow the alien car.
[588:34.56]I don't even give you one second to even get your bearings.
[588:38.80]You just go.
[588:40.74]We should start.
[588:41.52]Time.
[588:41.92]Go.
[588:42.32]Now.
[588:42.66]Go.
[588:43.06]Go.
[588:43.44]Go.
[588:49.43]Where is this going to put me?
[588:53.95]Thank God.
[588:54.41]Okay.
[589:12.93]Just go.
[589:15.93]Why?
[589:16.63]Just drive around me.
[589:19.94]I have to move out of the way.
[589:21.18]He's just gonna drive into me.
[589:22.66]Alright, get out of the fucking street!
[589:41.48]Just gotta stay with him, that's it.
[590:02.79]Those boats just look like I can drive through them.
[590:05.17]I should be able to.
[590:05.95]If they're ghost boats, why can't I just drive through them?
[590:16.38]I don't understand.
[590:21.96]What was that?
[590:25.24]What happened to the car?
[590:26.26]Why did I do that?
[590:28.78]Sorry.
[590:29.52]Didn't fail.
[590:30.72]Shut up, Homer!
[590:44.76]Never want to scream that.
[590:47.71]Talk to Professor Frank.
[591:03.65]Five more Five more
[591:20.22]it could save the life of you and your family and look I've loaded my vehicle with nuclear waste from the power plant it's going to deliver this toxic here is the alien ship risking myself and my delicious brain to zombie snacking which if you've never undergone that I can tell you it stings what a hero and I never knew his name ah it's professor John Frank are you still here
[591:47.38]Alright.
[591:48.16]Protect Professor Frank from the aliens.
[591:49.80]Deliver the nuclear waste to the spaceship.
[591:52.46]Let's do this thing!
[591:55.16]So I don't have to protect them.
[591:56.54]I just have to drive.
[591:58.04]Okay, just get to where I need to go.
[592:01.81]Oh, this car.
[592:02.59]Not this car.
[592:08.67]I saw the thing.
[592:09.27]I looked.
[592:12.79]Piece of cake!
[592:20.90]I didn't even see that guy.
[592:23.30]They got blended in with the ground.
[592:28.98]Did you see that?
[592:32.81]You didn't really see that guy?
[592:33.87]So many people on the road.
[592:46.06]It's like midnight.
[592:46.74]What are you doing here?
[592:49.53]I guess you could say the same thing about me.
[592:51.09]You could say the same thing about this stream right now.
[592:57.67]I don't know why.
[593:00.53]I could have just driven past, but for some reason I was like, oh, go there.
[593:03.97]Do that.
[593:05.47]Okay.
[593:16.66]Could have gone through there, too.
[593:20.61]Oh, dear.
[593:23.21]Whoa.
[593:24.51]Could have done a lot of things.
[593:27.23]Control limited.
[593:28.77]Impact imminent.
[593:29.88]Learn to drive, dumbass.
[593:31.28]Oh, boy.
[593:50.97]I feel like I've gone in a circle.
[593:53.87]I'm still going the right way, right?
[594:10.55]What?
[594:11.39]What happened?
[594:12.61]Where is it?
[594:13.03]Where is it?
[594:13.39]Where is it?
[594:13.77]Where is it?
[594:14.41]Where is it?
[594:14.91]I got it!
[594:19.46]I did it.
[594:19.92]I did it.
[594:20.44]Just... I'm not going to ask any questions.
[594:22.72]I'm just going.
[594:25.50]Glurvic?
[594:26.80]I can't seem to Glurvic.
[594:32.02]Wrench, give me that.
[594:33.76]Observe.
[594:42.22]Gravity in action.
[594:44.84]Glidy, that was big.
[594:47.82]Help!
[594:50.98]I'm not sure.
[594:51.48]Where's the indicator pointing?
[594:54.82]Oh, uh, oh boy.
[594:57.76]Take King Homer, if you dare.
[595:01.48]Oh, dear.
[595:01.96]Who cares about this mechanic that was put in in eight minutes?
[595:05.29]Help, it's not good.
[595:08.39]Help!
[595:18.99]This thing is so hard to drive.
[595:50.52]Slippery sloppy thing.
[595:54.18]Alright.
[595:55.88]Did it.
[595:56.54]Good job.
[595:57.84]Drive to school.
[595:59.42]The smoke is just causing too many problems.
[596:13.86]I need a wrench.
[596:19.81]Wrench?
[596:24.35]That hurt because I didn't have a good down.
[596:28.44]There's a wrench.
[596:29.50]I don't have time for it.
[596:34.82]There's a wrench right there, too.
[596:36.49]There's a wrench right there, too.
[596:38.21]Great.
[596:38.75]Occam's razor.
[596:57.31]How close am I?
[596:58.61]Do it!
[597:28.80]Do it!
[597:29.22]Where is this thing?
[597:30.26]Come on!
[597:31.20]It's right there!
[597:31.98]I f- oh.
[597:32.20]Thank god I just have to do this part.
[597:33.98]What the fuck was that?
[597:35.56]What?
[597:59.65]I don't get it.
[598:00.31]So you have to... This thing can explode.
[598:02.46]So this has to be driven without hitting anything.
[598:32.85]Wait, wasn't I smashing into everything before?
[598:39.69]I crashed so hard into... I... See, I'm crashing.
[598:57.62]Not enough, apparently.
[599:00.46]Get out of the way.
[599:01.06]You're in the worst possible spot.
[599:14.38]Everybody just has to drive right in front of you.
[599:22.67]The placement of the other cars... It's just... Like, look at these three.
[599:29.05]Get out of the freaking... God!
[599:33.26]Out of the way!
[599:34.14]I'm going the wrong way.
[599:36.02]Thank God.
[599:45.19]Put it in the tractor beam
[599:58.33]Okay, I did it.
[600:01.51]Jesus!
[600:02.57]Oh, I thought I was in the car.
[600:05.75]Holy shit.
[600:28.21]I can't kill a bug!
[600:30.15]Alright, that was fun.
[600:38.84]What's next?
[600:41.90]Jerma, did I... Did you find the hot dog?
[600:44.49]I don't think I found a hot dog.
[601:00.14]I hate this game.
[601:01.88]Why?
[601:03.44]Tell me your hate.
[601:05.28]Tell me your reasons, I'll tell you mine.
[601:09.06]I'm just kidding.
[601:29.07]This is the worst mission, really?
[601:31.97]Get into a vehicle.
[601:33.57]It's really, really...
[601:54.56]helpful stuff that I've been counting down already and I haven't even got outside yet.
[602:00.89]It's just... it's unnecessary stress!
[602:16.56]I can't go pick the kind of car for the mission that I wanted.
[602:19.24]No, no, no.
[602:19.92]Hurry up.
[602:20.46]Walk out and get in the car.
[602:21.42]You have 25 seconds, bud.
[602:28.91]Stay away from the alien car.
[602:57.31]I had to have watched you by now.
[602:58.71]Now that's driving.
[603:01.91]Vengeance will be mine.
[603:07.50]What happened here?
[603:10.48]This is zombies.
[603:11.96]The zombies chief.
[603:14.84]Oh, I wanted a peanut.
[603:17.28]It's not a big deal.
[603:25.14]Go over it.
[603:25.52]Just make the whole thing.
[603:26.28]Am I going to make it?
[603:27.72]I don't think so.
[603:31.24]I'm not sure I'm going to make this.
[603:33.88]No.
[603:33.97]No way.
[603:34.35]No!
[603:55.06]It's crashing time!
[603:57.36]Lousy rotten karmic retribution.
[604:06.78]Coming through!
[604:10.72]Reckless driving is my pet peeve.
[604:20.81]Uh-oh, it's that black car again.
[604:22.67]Ooh, it has the speed of a sub-boss.
[604:25.11]I'm one of these witches.
[604:26.59]Every car in the road.
[604:29.01]Every car in the road.
[604:30.09]They just try.
[604:30.93]They just try to get in your way.
[604:33.09]Learn to drive, dumbass.
[604:35.00]Just a few more.
[604:40.32]I'm still not even close.
[604:42.26]This car sure can take a beating.
[604:43.96]I'm a lean, mean, speedy... I gotta go pee.
[604:51.36]There's no way I'm gonna make it.
[604:52.78]Because I don't even have the indicator of where the hell I need to go.
[604:55.85]I just finally got it.
[605:04.55]I feel like I'm playing Operation.
[605:06.71]With a cart.
[605:09.95]You gotta time limit in Operation.
[605:11.33]It's like, don't touch anything.
[605:13.54]Oh, now I have a wedgie.
[605:14.70]Eat my dust.
[605:21.00]Like, look at all these fucking cars just everywhere.
[605:26.02]I fucking can't anymore, man.
[605:29.58]Why?
[605:49.79]There was two cars.
[605:50.95]Alright.
[605:51.79]Listen.
[605:53.25]There were two cars in the right side of the road.
[605:56.38]You understand?
[606:00.06]I had to... How was I gonna... What's happening?
[606:02.54]What?
[606:18.41]climb the building a lot of money
[607:03.42]Okay.
[607:03.80]Now what the hell do you want me to do?
[607:08.92]Do I have to keep climbing?
[607:17.74]Cameron.
[607:23.37]This is probably the worst possible squad I could be in.
[607:39.59]Don't move.
[608:29.16]Instead of just double jumps forward.
[608:33.58]Should've just... put... no, I'm not gonna talk shit.
[608:37.98]Yeah, I am.
[608:45.34]Please put... oh, he's gonna do it.
[608:47.14]He's gonna do it.
[608:49.10]He's gonna say it.
[608:51.08]Yeah, he is.
[608:52.14]Is he?
[608:52.38]I don't know.
[608:52.98]He might... I think he's gonna say it.
[608:54.81]Please put more 4 out of 10 platforming in a card game.
[608:59.24]I didn't mean to say that.
[609:29.05]The camera is... I can't see the shadow.
[609:31.08]Alright, I'm not... I don't give a fuck.
[609:36.32]Get me up there.
[609:40.08]Like, what?
[609:41.04]Yeah, great.
[609:41.79]Can I drive a fucking car now?
[609:44.19]What?
[610:15.92]This is a game.
[610:30.12]Trap.
[610:33.18]Trap.
[610:34.36]Not trap.
[610:54.27]I can't get him.
[611:24.52]This one's safe.
[611:33.11]Safe.
[611:33.59]Right here.
[611:34.33]Okay.
[611:35.43]Number two on left is safe.
[611:37.03]What about number three on... Just talk to Mr. Burns.
[611:44.42]I'd love to do that.
[611:53.03]Okay.
[611:53.49]These two are safe.
[611:56.35]Jesus.
[611:56.85]Okay.
[611:58.11]Oh my god.
[611:59.80]That duck at the top.
[612:01.26]Three.
[612:01.66]This is safe.
[612:05.64]This is safe.
[612:10.34]This is safe.
[612:25.84]He has to be safe.
[612:26.64]Mr. Burns, it's me, Homer Simpson.
[612:29.17]So you're not the ghost of my former partner?
[612:40.80]Get it.
[612:41.60]Next game?
[612:43.44]Almost ten hours into this game.
[612:44.99]Next.
[612:45.19]Let's move on now.
[612:45.77]I got two missions left.
[613:11.60]Collect and deliver the nuclear waste to the spaceship.
[613:13.74]Don't let time run out.
[613:18.25]Now get into your vehicle.
[613:20.29]But these are all still activated.
[613:21.57]Are they still active?
[613:26.84]Actually, better that way.
[613:27.78]I should have just done it in the first place.
[613:32.12]Where's my car?
[613:50.17]This is the worst possible vehicle to do this.
[614:01.78]As you see why.
[614:21.66]I could just... No.
[614:22.54]I need another car.
[614:23.28]I need to get my car.
[614:24.04]It blew up!
[614:32.20]This thing sucks such ass.
[614:34.32]I'm sorry lady.
[614:35.06]Good luck.
[614:36.71]Okay.
[614:55.65]Nice car.
[614:58.17]Finally I got a car out there.
[615:02.69]Just fall through!
[615:03.45]Fall through!
[615:05.05]The time stops.
[615:05.81]That's what a speedrunner does.
[615:06.68]The time doesn't keep ticking.
[615:15.42]Big bear?
[615:16.02]Why does everybody say big bear?
[615:18.42]I'm driving off without the juice.
[615:31.03]Okay, sit up.
[615:35.15]I'll be right back.
[615:35.87]I'm going to get a drink.
[615:36.83]I'll be right back.
[615:39.06]Hey, why don't I take over, Jerma?
[615:40.42]Hey, it's me, Jerma, sitting here.
[615:43.34]While he goes to the bathroom and gets some tea.
[615:46.82]Just want to say that those of you that have been watching, thanks for... By the way, just in case somebody's saying, oh, this is part of the video.
[615:55.29]It is January... What day?
[615:58.13]I don't... No, no, no.
[615:58.85]What day is it?
[616:00.11]It is Wednesday.
[616:01.11]Today's Wednesday.
[616:03.55]So the... What?
[616:04.49]The 20... Today's June 24th.
[616:08.08]So there you go.
[616:08.92]That's how you know this is real.
[616:11.36]Thanks for watching, though.
[616:13.08]I know I've been popping in and out a few times.
[616:17.06]I've seen people say, hey Jerma, why the fuck don't you just stream?
[616:21.04]And I see what you're saying.
[616:23.00]But the reason why is because I'm just really trying to take it easy.
[616:27.80]And high energy is kind of hard to do for a little while.
[616:32.93]And I'm on antibiotics right now too.
[616:35.69]And I kind of have a fucking headache.
[616:39.11]But there's a lot of people here.
[616:41.17]There's a shitload of people here.
[616:43.90]Uh, more people are watching the rerun of this stream than were here when the stream was live in the first place.
[616:50.52]So, that's shocking to me.
[616:52.94]That's really surprising to me.
[616:55.28]So, thanks a lot for watching, everybody.
[616:58.99]Uh, there's not going to be a bit rendering or anything after this.
[617:03.37]Um, I'm going to just kind of say goodbye.
[617:06.17]There's still probably like about an hour left of this stream.
[617:09.29]But...
[617:10.39]Yeah.
[617:12.09]We're going to do this again.
[617:14.62]We'll be doing this again on Sunday.
[617:17.32]And Sunday, I have not decided what it's going to be, but I will tell you.
[617:22.70]Let's say it's something like sorcery or anything that has more than one part.
[617:26.73]So let's say it was a House Flipper or something.
[617:30.01]I would do them back-to-back-to-back.
[617:32.53]So, Sorcery, I think, was about three or four, what, four-hour streams?
[617:36.79]That's back when I was only streaming once or twice a week.
[617:40.19]For, like, three hours at a time.
[617:42.16]So, we would just do it.
[617:45.00]I would just put them back-to-back-to-back.
[617:48.26]Sorcery is 30 hours total.
[617:48.94]Well, I... Wait, what?
[617:49.40]Sorcery was 30 hours?
[617:50.28]Why in my mind was it, like, 8?
[617:59.97]Okay, well... Uh, never mind.
[618:02.65]So... No, no, no.
[618:05.05]Hold on.
[618:05.64]I'm not ready.
[618:07.04]Should I... Alright.
[618:08.12]Here comes Jermon.
[618:09.12]He's coming in to finish this stream.
[618:11.20]Where are we?
[618:12.08]Restart, yeah.
[618:14.34]I'll catch you when the stream ends.
[618:17.27]I'll be back.
[618:24.88]I'm not drinking alcohol.
[618:26.18]You guys made me crash my game to prove it to you like six hours ago.
[618:30.12]I love to stick.
[618:31.80]I'm gonna try one of these tech.
[618:42.93]Ow!
[618:43.45]My neck!
[618:45.49]Just back out.
[618:51.41]It's crashing time!
[619:05.34]Let's roll.
[619:08.84]Ooh, the vibration's tickling my feet.
[619:18.42]Here we go.
[619:18.78]Get out of my way, jerkass.
[619:44.20]Okay, so far so good.
[619:46.52]You and the worst possible place you could be.
[619:53.29]Go in the... I didn't go in the fucking science fair.
[619:59.25]What is that place?
[620:00.09]A cemetery.
[620:01.08]Science excellente.
[620:07.32]Can't you see I'm driving here?
[620:13.59]Come on come on come on come on come on I wonder if I could just go right right there and maybe
[620:36.80]150.
[620:36.86]I could go right there, too, but I can't.
[620:38.24]It just pops up on me too fast.
[620:40.48]The important thing is I'm not imagining these guys.
[620:44.72]Eat my dust!
[620:48.72]What are you doing?
[620:49.52]What's happening right now?
[620:54.31]Get the lead out.
[620:55.95]Oh, man.
[620:56.71]My car is gone.
[620:57.93]And the ashtray was full of pennies.
[621:00.17]I need another car fast.
[621:01.35]Oh.
[621:06.82]Busted.
[621:07.04]I can't even get a hamburger anymore.
[621:09.52]It's so late right now, my god.
[621:11.86]I can't believe it.
[621:12.94]I was gonna get a triple cheeseburger.
[621:16.03]I'm gonna have to eat, like, Campbell's out of the can cold.
[621:35.96]Yeah, I'm gonna have to get some Campbell's or some tuna.
[621:38.74]I'm gonna have to eat just cold, wet tuna.
[621:41.82]That's what I'm eating tonight.
[621:45.68]There's somebody on the car.
[622:08.86]harder than it is oh like no still on my tail really how are you still on my tail get rid of this guy get away from me how hard is it to lose an alien oh come on
[622:31.93]He spawned.
[622:33.31]That guy spawned.
[622:35.83]That motherfucker spawned.
[622:38.24]He's throwing me off.
[622:40.22]I got there.
[622:41.34]I'm good.
[623:10.41]Where is it?
[623:15.88]Why did the timer- what?
[623:19.84]Did you just save the timer?
[623:24.16]What's going on?
[623:25.18]Get in the car!
[623:25.84]Wait.
[623:27.12]I have to do that again.
[623:40.45]No, I don't.
[623:41.11]Do I?
[623:46.23]I thought that I had... I go from that point.
[623:53.08]You don't go from that point, but I went from that point last time.
[624:01.52]Remember?
[624:04.95]You guys remember, right?
[624:07.15]Hey, that's totally not supposed to happen.
[624:09.27]The car exploded.
[624:09.63]The car exploded the first time, too.
[624:12.84]You should be in Cannonball Run.
[624:14.80]Like, out of my way, walking dude.
[624:23.04]Hey, welcome to the new show.
[624:25.50]You people fucking driving into you.
[624:27.88]You shouldn't be there.
[624:28.98]The news.
[624:32.46]Like, there's a convention in town.
[624:36.31]This town is going to pay for this.
[624:39.58]Lovely generic villains.
[624:43.04]Come on, suckers!
[624:48.16]Just arrest me, please.
[624:49.26]Take all my money.
[624:51.90]I don't care.
[624:55.14]Just get over there, grab it, and then I have to go all the way back, but then if it explodes, then I have to do the whole thing again.
[625:01.25]I don't get a checkpoint halfway through.
[625:03.53]I have to do the whole thing over again.
[625:06.97]Yeah!
[625:07.87]Mindless destruction!
[625:16.30]let me see alright in and out reverse reverse I've really got to learn to enjoy my parole
[625:44.39]He's getting stringy.
[625:45.34]He's getting really stringy.
[625:46.56]And I missed the shortcut.
[625:49.96]Don't miss another shortcut and you're fine.
[625:59.41]Like this.
[625:59.89]Don't miss this shortcut.
[626:01.05]It's right here for you.
[626:13.09]Hey, that's totally not supposed to happen.
[626:16.74]This town is going to pay for this.
[626:19.92]The important thing is I'm not imagining these guys.
[626:22.84]I'm going to mess you up.
[626:28.93]A goddamn miracle that this thing has a message.
[626:32.07]This town is going to pay for this.
[626:38.68]Sweet acceleration.
[626:40.56]What?
[626:42.54]Um, I have... So, do I have to... I have to go all the way back.
[626:55.49]That's what's happening.
[626:56.15]So, this is just essentially... Why don't I just reset?
[626:58.70]Because it's doing the same thing again.
[627:13.77]What?
[627:15.90]Like, did they just, like, give the fuck up when they made the end of this game?
[627:19.98]Are you telling me that this is the third time Drive the juice from... Really?
[627:30.75]This is the climax of your whole entire game, and it's Drive back and forth from the goddamn power plant?
[627:42.09]They had a dinosaur four and a half hours ago.
[628:23.70]Tell me now I need to know somebody tell me is the final mission of the game drive back and forth a bucket of sludge To the school tell me Wonderful
[628:45.11]Fantastic.
[628:48.34]I got two shortcuts.
[628:49.22]Eat deer.
[628:51.12]This town is going to pay for this.
[628:53.18]Eat deer.
[628:54.32]Mistakes were made.
[628:56.54]What deer are you talking about?
[628:57.84]Oh, I know.
[629:04.40]Where did this go?
[629:05.22]Please, I still have it.
[629:10.80]You're not a very good driver.
[629:16.63]Everybody's in my way.
[629:18.98]Forever.
[629:19.44]Permanently.
[629:19.88]I'm almost there.
[629:22.30]It's just going too fast.
[629:22.88]Gonna be close.
[629:23.24]There's no red light here.
[629:24.98]You're in a cartoon land.
[629:31.24]There are no red lights.
[629:32.36]Why would you stop in the middle of the road?
[629:44.97]The goddamn Simpsons!
[629:46.07]There are no lights!
[629:47.03]I have to do this again.
[630:08.35]For another mission.
[630:11.55]What?
[630:15.56]They just copy and pasted the final three missions in the game.
[630:28.53]You know, I would be really upset about this, but it's a fucking Simpsons game.
[630:35.12]I'm shocked this game even functions.
[630:42.22]I'm not gonna make it.
[630:53.06]I'm gonna fail and end up right in front of it, aren't I?
[631:05.45]You're almost done?
[631:06.27]I know, I have to see this through.
[631:15.27]where are they what why what are you why are you facing the car this way sir why did I face this way why when I go the other end one side road hog dude nothing lasts forever
[631:45.89]Here's this dumbass again.
[631:52.19]Another variable that, like, Greg down the hall in fucking modeling decided to put in.
[631:58.82]Now then, driving.
[632:16.20]Why are you blaming Greg?
[632:18.62]He was the anchor that held this project together.
[632:20.80]Whoa, like there's a convention in town.
[632:35.62]One side, Roadhog dude.
[632:45.91]I love how somebody just wrote, Jeremy, this joke has run its course for, it's been 10 hours.
[632:51.97]Imagine if this was just a big bit I was doing.
[632:56.13]I'm gonna beat the whole Simpsons hit and run on stream.
[633:02.01]That's just like, I'm just fucking around.
[633:05.03]I got ya!
[633:08.44]Every time I do that.
[633:09.40]I do it every time.
[633:11.30]Eat my dust!
[633:17.34]Like out of my way walking dude We're starting to get to like melt my brain level here I just see the same image on my screen
[633:40.52]I haven't even seen more than probably four or five episodes of The Simpsons, but I feel like I've watched all of them.
[633:46.11]I know every... I know everything.
[633:48.51]I know every scenario.
[633:49.57]I know every joke.
[633:51.31]I'm certain I do.
[633:53.42]I can tell you them all.
[633:56.10]I'm gonna have a Simpsons dream.
[633:57.22]I'm gonna start making my pancakes in the shape of Homer's ass.
[634:03.57]Start talking like Marge.
[634:13.06]Hey!
[634:13.56]That's totally not supposed to happen.
[634:16.54]I've really got to learn to enjoy my parole more often.
[634:20.24]We did it.
[634:26.69]That was so painful!
[634:29.01]Yeah, it was pretty painful.
[634:30.31]Now I have to do that again.
[634:31.05]Alright, last one.
[634:32.67]One more.
[634:34.15]One more.
[634:36.68]Where is it?
[635:06.89]What's happening?
[635:07.55]Where's my indicator?
[635:08.45]Where's my indicator?
[635:12.21]Did I not get one?
[635:20.14]I can't... I have to find my own way.
[635:27.74]Same place.
[635:29.88]Race the alien car.
[635:33.18]I can't... I am gonna sneeze, but I can't mute it.
[635:37.69]Why do I have to race this car?
[635:39.86]The game is fucking crashing.
[635:44.12]I'm flying.
[635:44.62]I'm flying!
[635:45.00]No, I'm not.
[636:12.25]Let's make this scene!
[636:15.65]Move it!
[636:30.74]He's in!
[636:31.32]He's in!
[636:31.78]He's here!
[636:32.22]He's here!
[636:33.08]He's here!
[636:34.14]He's here!
[636:48.02]Oh, I just alt-tabbed.
[637:56.68]This is not going to move and it'll hopefully come back.
[638:09.88]I just saw a thousand times join the Discord, and I was like, fine, I'm already frustrated, and I alt-tabbed, and I pressed, and now I don't know when the last time the game was saved.
[638:40.10]What was the last level?
[638:46.74]What was the last one?
[638:50.62]Is there like some kind of magic I can do to bring this back?
[638:54.55]Does anybody have any ideas?
[638:56.67]Some weird PC fucking magic curse shit to bring this back.
[639:07.31]Cheat.
[639:08.23]Okay.
[639:08.35]Okay.
[639:09.45]Yeah, I'm going to cheat.
[639:10.27]I'm cheating.
[639:13.23]Oh, we're cheating.
[639:14.51]Absolutely.
[639:16.17]What's the cheat code to get to the last level?
[639:28.54]Thank you, CassAF, for the five community subs.
[639:39.02]You can try looking for a save file.
[639:42.60]I appreciate the help.
[639:43.67]This is my own fault, though.
[639:46.97]No, don't blame the people in the Discord.
[639:48.89]That's my fault.
[639:51.95]For alt-tabbing and forgetting that that happens.
[639:59.05]Alright, I'm going to cheat.
[640:00.98]Okay.
[640:04.16]Okay.
[640:09.84]I'm just going to do it quick.
[640:12.48]I'm going to do it nice and quick.
[640:17.02]Look at this and how softly I'm speaking now.
[640:25.59]Okay.
[640:25.99]Hold on.
[640:28.39]I just need to do one more.
[640:57.97]This is like the third time I did this.
[641:01.09]What's wrong with me?
[641:02.85]I had so many opportunities to not do that.
[641:07.67]At least I heard people screaming in the Discord.
[641:09.64]Alright, here we go.
[641:12.85]I'm gonna punch in the thing.
[641:14.29]You know what?
[641:14.63]I talked a lot of shit about this game.
[641:18.19]It's this game from like 2003, so I can cheat and just get back to where I was.
[641:28.61]That's great.
[641:37.90]This is like an athlete taking drugs right before the finish line.
[641:42.04]no it's come on hopefully you can see it though I'm gonna have to add it again now you got it good we're good we're good we're good 20th century pocket alright what buttons do I press what's the combo how do I do it Simpsons hit and run up down left right a b a b start what's wrong
[642:13.64]Can I just skip I think I know I could skip the missions I was gonna do right Holy shit, this is far away Alright, so I'm gonna fail and skip
[642:43.77]Hey, present Jerma speaking.
[642:48.55]I don't remember this happening.
[642:50.17]I just came back and I... I don't remember this happening.
[642:54.96]Okay.
[642:55.78]Options.
[642:57.14]Somebody's got options.

[643:01.84]Options.
[643:02.68]F1, right up, right up.
[643:10.51]What is... What are you guys saying?
[643:13.96]What was it?
[643:14.46]That's not real.
[643:15.66]Join the Discord.
[643:16.70]Join the Discord.
[643:17.52]Okay, here we go.
[643:19.28]I'm going to fuck up and I'm going to... Oh my god, it's here!
[643:27.36]You can skip fishes, but I have to fail them first.
[643:30.71]What's the fastest way to fail a mission?
[643:38.43]Blow off the car.
[643:39.83]This is gonna take a while.
[643:41.21]There's a cheat to unlock all the missions.
[643:43.37]F1, F2, F1, F2, up, down, up, down.
[643:44.19]Just get out of the car.
[644:10.42]What was that?
[644:12.48]What was that like?
[644:15.73]Somebody just squeezed.
[644:18.93]I can't.
[644:20.67]Don't tell me to alt tab and Google this shit.
[644:23.73]Alt tab and Google.
[644:26.11]Oh, wait.
[644:28.55]Here he comes.
[644:29.05]He's in the Discord.
[644:35.03]I have an idea.
[644:35.79]Hey, streamer, join the Discord.
[644:37.69]Oh, I have a telephone!
[644:39.46]Scream.
[644:41.26]Just scream the second you see his name coming.
[644:44.50]Okay, Simpsons.
[644:45.90]Why is that?
[644:46.52]I can't believe I'm doing this.
[644:49.28]Why is that the reaction that everybody has?
[644:52.11]The second that somebody goes into a Discord, like if I jump into the Discord right now, it's just everyone's like, hey, there he is.
[644:58.25]It's time to scream as loud as I can into my microphone.
[645:04.71]You know, I want one time to go to the Discord, and it's silent.
[645:10.17]Just completely silent.
[645:11.33]And then one person just goes, Welcome, Jeremy.
[645:14.56]Okay, why can't that happen?
[645:22.58]Let's try it again.
[645:29.85]Hey, Jeremy, suck!
[645:38.66]I'm not supposed to laugh at this?
[645:40.08]Okay, I gotta go.
[645:52.78]It doesn't matter.
[645:53.96]Someone's gotta do it.
[645:57.49]Enjoy the movie.
[645:58.87]Simpsons hit and run PC cheats.
[646:06.38]alright let's see retry mission like sure cheat codes uh that by the way that I was not getting baited in the chat that person was actually telling the truth but that doesn't help me that much
[646:39.67]It's just all characters, all vehicles.
[646:42.11]Different camera angles.
[646:44.47]Invincibility, higher acceleration.
[646:46.41]That's still gonna... Oh my god.
[646:54.48]Main menu options.
[646:56.02]Piece of cake!
[647:08.41]You know, the reason why I didn't save is because I think a bunch of- I looked over and people said that I had a corrupted save file.
[647:14.26]And I just didn't save and I was so... I'm sorry, that's fucking so funny.
[647:22.86]Hey, dude, you have a corrupted fucking save file.
[647:26.08]So, guys, come on.
[647:29.66]Oh, wow, Drew, you stink.
[647:30.78]You suck.
[647:31.82]You know, I look over and chat and people are like, dude, your save file's corrupted.
[647:40.00]Pick and choose what to believe.
[647:41.44]Alright, what am I trying?
[647:42.34]Oh, man.
[647:43.58]I feel so defeated.
[647:44.60]I was at the end of the game.
[647:46.64]God damn it.
[647:48.46]I should have just stared at the screen.
[647:57.45]So, I guess... I've missed you guys, man.
[648:00.41]I'm telling you.
[648:01.77]So, let's see here.
[648:03.07]I've only popped in here like a handful of times over the course of the day.
[648:06.42]You guys are fucking crazy.
[648:09.34]I love it.
[648:12.17]If you fail a mission five times, it lets you skip, but I have to fail, like, five missions five times.
[648:31.98]Just reset the mission.
[648:33.35]Can I just reset the mission five?
[648:35.05]Does that count?
[648:36.27]I guess it does, right?
[648:41.23]See what happens if I do that.
[648:42.21]Download a save?
[648:56.56]I'm kind of afraid to do that.
[649:03.17]For one reason.
[649:04.35]Because I feel like this is like a... To get the game to even run, there's mods and shit to get the game to work.
[649:09.39]I feel like I could fuck up a lot of shit, maybe.
[649:11.38]Alright, here we go.
[649:16.66]Let's see if this counts.
[649:23.41]Sweet!
[649:25.07]I'm a liquid!
[649:33.26]It doesn't count.
[649:47.00]You must fail it, not restart it.
[649:54.05]I was right there.
[649:55.39]Why did I not save it?
[649:56.85]I don't know why.
[649:57.75]I'm just, my brain is so fried.
[649:59.37]I don't know how to cover up people saying, come up, save, don't save.
[650:04.86]Why are you doing, why are you continuing to throw rocks at my house?
[650:09.26]I thought we were over that.
[650:25.57]I feel so unfulfilled, though.
[650:27.31]I'm so unfulfilled!
[650:29.75]What's the fastest way to lose?
[650:32.03]Drive into the ocean?
[650:33.29]Another one?
[650:52.27]Just go to the power plant, I guess.
[650:56.85]The start of this mission has a 20 second timer.
[651:01.45]Just exit the car at the beginning of the mission.
[651:03.67]It might be faster to just beat the missions.
[651:11.68]I was dumb.
[651:19.92]It was so close.
[651:21.70]Oh.
[651:24.80]Just wait the 20 seconds?
[651:26.14]Am I- I'm not emulating the game.
[651:47.61]This is the PC version.
[652:00.17]I can't just, like, fuck it up?
[652:06.33]Destroy the car.
[652:08.39]I wonder what the fastest way to do that is.
[652:15.02]Maybe the actual mod that I have can... I can use it, maybe.
[652:26.62]I love how we're trying to figure out ways to make this go back to normal.
[652:31.47]Just watch the ending on YouTube.
[652:37.67]Alright, hold on here.
[652:39.03]I think I got away.
[652:45.56]Kill code might save us here.
[652:46.90]Let's see.
[652:51.41]Kill code, you gonna save us?
[652:52.47]Let's find out.
[653:00.75]The all mission cheat is in the mod manager.
[653:03.45]Yes!
[653:08.41]It's under unlock all missions.
[653:27.01]Oh, would you just love it.
[653:29.75]There it is.
[653:30.83]It's done.
[653:32.05]All missions have been unlocked.
[653:34.15]Let's go.
[653:34.51]I thought you were gonna debate me in the alt tab and Discord, huh?
[653:57.23]How do I do this?
[654:04.86]So how do I select a mission?
[654:09.36]Somebody said, what voice was that?
[654:11.26]That was Tony Clifton.
[654:14.08]Just in case I wanted to answer that person's question.
[654:18.10]Yeah, I can still see you.
[654:21.24]Load game.
[654:24.36]Or just resume.
[654:27.44]New game plus.
[654:29.54]Resume game.
[654:35.76]Okay.
[654:49.13]Let's go!
[654:49.63]Let's go.
[654:51.68]Let's go.
[654:53.06]Let's do it.
[654:55.14]I'm ready.
[654:56.26]Let's go.
[654:59.08]Let's do it.
[654:59.58]Come on.
[655:00.16]First fucking try.
[655:01.04]Check this out.
[655:01.88]Three, two, one.
[655:03.28]Hot diggity!
[655:10.91]Why did I come here again?
[655:14.97]Homer hates losing!
[655:16.83]Homer smash!
[655:27.66]He used the cheat code!
[655:34.68]I don't know why I'm on the phone.
[655:37.45]There it is.
[655:38.47]You dick.
[656:07.75]I'll tear you a new corn chute!
[656:10.59]Get out of my way, jerk!
[656:11.83]Get off the wheels!
[656:14.85]Oh, my God!
[656:15.93]It was there!
[656:16.79]I'm not gonna make it and then...
[656:35.24]I can't.
[656:43.20]Go to the Bard.
[656:43.98]It's too much.
[656:44.60]It's been 11 hours.
[656:46.01]I can't focus.
[656:57.31]It's gonna take me like a week to recover from this stream.
[657:06.80]I may have even shit my pants and I don't even know.
[657:11.54]It's possible.
[657:12.14]Look at him trying.
[657:17.40]Look at him just ruining everything.
[657:18.88]Look at him fucking ruining everything.
[657:22.26]Just flipping cars over.
[657:23.98]Good thing you're stupid.
[657:26.64]Oh, did I do something wrong?
[657:28.56]Two, four, six, eight.
[657:29.86]You suck, I'm great.
[657:31.20]Da, da, da, da.
[657:32.56]You, I hate.
[657:33.78]Hot diggity!
[657:36.78]Clear it.
[657:38.92]Okay, done.
[657:41.48]Shoma, shut up, please!
[657:53.15]I'm gonna turn off the voice.
[657:54.37]I don't wanna hear talking about his feet.
[657:58.34]I used to say it a fucking thousand times.
[658:00.80]A fucking thousand times.
[658:05.38]I don't care about Homer's feet anymore.
[658:09.18]I'm here.
[658:09.54]I'm here.
[658:09.88]Just drive anyway.
[658:19.45]This is the only time that I have to get back?
[658:24.01]No way!
[658:24.81]That's less than a minute!
[658:37.72]I need a wrench
[659:06.68]Right now.
[659:12.44]Is there a wrench here?
[659:16.25]There's no wrench.
[659:18.59]I'm in so much trouble.
[659:29.94]Yeah, Ghost is going to work at the power plant.
[659:37.65]On your brainless AI path.
[659:43.46]No, there's no way this ain't happening.
[660:12.54]Cuz it's just- it got less than- you gotta hit everything perfect.
[660:16.58]Even this is a pain in the ass.
[660:17.90]I gotta- you gotta beat him there, and then... What kind of drugs were these kids taking back here to- to- to beat this?
[660:27.23]What?!
[660:32.64]I don't understand!
[660:52.07]The random AI drivers are infuriating.
[661:00.40]They just sometimes are in the worst possible spot.
[661:15.43]He just squished me, and it saved my life.
[661:19.46]How am I gonna focus to be able to do this?
[661:22.99]All the way back, it's volcano.
[661:25.07]And then, since I'm squinting right now, cemetery, volcano.
[661:33.51]I got double dunked.
[661:38.01]Out of the fucking way.
[661:39.11]Get, please.
[661:40.57]And I'm already smoking.
[662:04.07]Fucking which which I just I gotta go this way.
[662:08.01]Oh my god You
[662:33.10]I'm down with it!
[662:41.87]Everybody's a witch.
[662:42.55]I didn't even sit down.
[662:43.83]Okay, come on.
[662:52.99]All I imagine, the only way this is possible to beat this on the first or second try ever.
[662:58.21]I mean, we're talking... We fucking did it.
[663:02.62]We did it together.
[663:03.84]We're in this together, alien.
[663:07.98]Good, I'm glad I'm killing this witch.
[663:10.96]I hope I broke every bone in that witch's body.
[663:14.02]Wow, slow down.
[663:15.45]Easy.
[663:19.73]Unnecessary.
[663:28.17]He's right next to me.
[663:29.13]We're both gonna do the same thing.
[663:30.47]He's gonna hit me.
[663:32.12]I can hear him.
[663:32.66]He's right behind me.
[663:34.58]I think he crashed.
[663:35.88]Yeah, that dude crashed.
[663:40.86]Thank you.
[663:41.52]Drive into me, please.
[663:51.30]Does anybody else feel like they're flying through space right now?
[663:54.60]Fucking get out of my way!
[663:58.48]I'm in like a time warp.
[663:59.92]So many pumpkin cars.
[664:01.60]Okay.
[664:02.04]No witch.
[664:25.26]If there's a witch, I'll puke.
[664:26.16]There's a witch.
[664:26.80]Get out of the way, you fucking stupid.
[664:30.70]I still am okay.
[664:31.62]I'm okay.
[664:32.84]No.
[664:37.96]We're talking.
[664:42.22]We're talking.
[664:46.01]Same spot.
[664:48.33]It's possible still.
[664:52.35]No, it's not.
[665:13.24]I blame the witch again.
[665:14.17]It was the witch's fault again.
[665:41.71]So, somebody give $100.
[665:45.31]Thank you for the $100.
[665:47.66]Yes is online.
[665:53.58]Thank you.
[665:54.64]The Discord apologizes for their actions.
[665:56.69]We were just having fun and didn't mean to ruin the stream.
[666:10.57]Uh, you didn't ruin the stream.
[666:14.35]Thank you so much for $100.
[666:15.27]As long as you have, it don't matter.
[666:18.06]If you're having fun, I'm happy.
[666:19.24]Who cares?
[666:21.08]Did the game get louder?
[666:24.68]Am I, am I hearing things?
[666:26.12]Did I, did the game get louder?
[666:28.31]I think the game got louder.
[666:31.91]Just for a second there.
[666:34.07]Hey, roll yourself off a cliff.
[666:36.49]Dickhead, get out of my way.
[666:47.72]See, he's having trouble with the robot people too.
[666:50.68]And the witches.
[666:51.24]I don't even know what he did.
[666:56.76]He just crashed, I think.
[667:10.31]I cleared it.
[667:16.41]The game's getting louder.
[667:18.01]Is this just me?
[667:26.48]The music.
[667:28.96]I'm about to go into another plane.
[667:33.02]I feel like the rapture is happening right now and I'm going up.
[667:44.79]Okay.
[667:47.81]Is there a wrench?
[667:54.56]What's this wrench?
[667:55.08]Is there a wrench in here?
[668:01.91]No, no, no, no, no.
[668:03.25]Reverse in!
[668:03.83]That's a great idea!
[668:04.77]Fuck!
[668:26.60]Oh, why did you do that?
[668:28.14]I hit it perfect.
[668:33.66]These fucking idiots on this absurd, nearly impossible part of the game.
[668:49.11]You have to have these guys like all over the fucking road.
[669:02.57]Do I want anything from McDonald's?
[669:04.35]Yeah, two Big Macs!
[669:06.41]Two Big Macs, two large fries, and a large shake!
[669:11.52]And I want it, I want it!
[669:27.42]I want it now!
[669:28.38]I don't even know where I'm driving.
[669:36.92]Please and thank you.
[669:38.99]Thank you.
[670:03.67]It's not the route.
[670:05.05]It's not the shortcuts.
[670:06.61]It's the random dickheads that just drive around and make it impossible.
[670:12.25]The one guy in the boat that just gets in the way because you have a minute to drive across the game.
[670:18.48]And this guy just rose out in front of you in the middle of the fucking lake.
[670:36.99]Unmute the voices for the finale?
[670:39.79]Maybe.
[670:45.49]As the fish out there, you kill the same guy every time.
[670:50.07]You have no remorse for that?
[670:51.25]Do you feel nothing with that?
[670:53.23]Mukhtari is fishing with my friend.
[671:06.84]I eat shit.
[671:08.58]I don't know what just happened to my car, but it just, like, fucking goes... I'll get it.
[671:26.08]Somebody said there's a really big shortcut I'm missing.
[671:29.27]Is there... The graveyard is the one I keep jumping into the fucking wall.
[671:36.24]I'm going too fast.
[671:38.13]Turn on the face game.
[671:38.97]I don't have any clothes on.
[671:39.83]I gotta stop reading.
[671:40.71]God, I'm going the wrong way again.
[672:06.63]I think something happened here.
[672:09.13]Alright, let's try it again.
[672:10.13]Alright, somebody had a great idea.
[672:37.35]Punch it!
[672:51.30]It's throwing me off.
[672:52.16]It threw me off.
[672:52.76]Have you seen the Jim Carrey movie where he deletes his memory of shit?
[673:05.72]Turtle Sunshine don't want to remember my girlfriend, whatever the fucking name of the thing is.
[673:14.87]I wonder if they exist for... You know.
[673:49.63]I can't go to bed.
[673:50.53]I have to beat this.
[673:51.85]I can't.
[673:52.87]You think I'll ever live that down?
[673:54.97]I'm not going to be the guy that almost beat Simpsons Hit and Run on screen.
[674:01.30]I'm not going to be the guy that got to the end of Simpsons Hit and Run on screen.
[674:05.84]I want to be the guy that beat Simpsons Hit and Run on screen.
[674:18.13]This is the last mission.
[674:19.16]This is it.
[674:19.86]This is all that matters.
[674:21.00]Is this.
[674:27.48]I have an idea.
[674:29.56]Call me crazy on this one.
[674:30.54]Go ahead.
[674:31.40]I got a great idea.
[674:32.50]Trust me.
[674:44.89]Too many distractions.
[674:45.71]Too many loud sounds.
[674:46.79]Too many fucking screaming.
[674:50.58]Here we go.
[676:52.11]second alien car second alien second alien car I didn't why is there another second alien
[677:24.68]How is he in front of me?
[677:26.28]Shh!
[678:03.46]What a weird stream this has become.
[678:12.31]I'll try it again.
[678:18.12]He just exploded.
[678:26.22]I need that wrench so bad.
[678:27.78]I don't care.
[678:34.05]The wrench is over here.
[678:34.95]It's worth it.
[679:53.00]I hit one guy and all of a sudden the police are here.
[680:09.95]The police shouldn't be here.
[680:29.67]Please, please.
[680:32.97]Oh my god.
[680:34.99]Oh my god.
[680:35.37]Oh my god.
[680:41.69]No, no, no.
[680:47.75]No.
[680:56.01]No.
[680:56.13]No.
[680:59.34]Don't get in the meme.
[681:02.33]I don't care.
[681:03.09]No, don't do this to me.
[681:46.51]I was... I was... I win.
[681:48.89]I got in the... I got in the beam.
[681:52.43]And then I got arrested in the beam.
[681:56.57]I got arrested inside the beam.
[682:00.02]And it put me out.
[682:00.74]I didn't really know where I was.
[682:02.04]And then one time I figured it out.
[682:09.00]Grandpa, I don't know what to say about that one.
[682:15.06]I can't believe it.
[682:16.67]It was there.
[682:18.13]It was over.
[682:18.59]I got impressed in the beam.
[682:30.32]I need to have no sounds though.
[682:31.82]No sounds really does help.
[682:45.68]If you did it once, you can do it again.
[682:46.90]That's true.
[682:47.84]And I can do it even cleaner this time.
[682:49.45]I'm on life support right now.
[683:06.86]I think this is the first time I've ever had a stream longer than 11 hours.
[683:10.98]It has to be.
[683:21.48]Simpsons fucking hit and run.
[683:24.55]I'm gonna get a tattoo of this game.
[683:26.37]Up my ass.
[683:27.19]On my ass.
[683:38.25]Longest stream you've ever done, huh?
[683:40.03]How's the boat?
[683:41.07]Where's the skipper?
[683:42.24]Longest stream ever, huh?
[683:43.56]Well, I have one thing to say about that.
[683:45.70]I'm still gonna beat him.
[684:03.51]This is what it sounds like in here, guys.
[684:05.69]This is what my room sounds like.
[684:12.92]Wait, no, no, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[684:14.18]Wait, wait, they changed their terms of service.
[684:15.70]I could get fucking literally thrown out for that.
[684:18.24]I forgot about that.
[684:19.02]Never mind.
[684:19.62]I know that there's two dickheads over there on the left.
[684:24.50]Here we go.
[684:25.44]I did it once before.
[684:27.91]You don't know what that was.
[684:28.81]That was just a generic orchestra going like...
[684:33.38]That could have been anything.
[684:34.67]They all start like that.
[684:36.77]That wasn't what you think it was.
[684:40.07]That was the first part of the Boston Pops 4th July spectacular, okay?
[684:44.77]That wasn't what you thought it was.
[685:01.55]That's not public domain either.
[685:03.59]Well... Well, bye!
[685:07.01]See you later!
[685:07.63]What did I do wrong at the end there?
[685:11.05]There's a wrench right here.
[685:11.87]I'll get it.
[685:17.96]Okay.
[685:18.66]Everybody relax.
[685:19.88]I've got 30 seconds to get in there and spin around.
[685:24.00]If I... Oh, man.
[685:34.87]Alright.
[685:43.62]No cops.
[685:44.62]Better.
[685:45.38]Good.
[687:28.43]There's the end of the episode!
[687:29.63]I did it.
[687:32.17]I beat it.
[687:32.65]I beat the- I beat it.
[687:33.81]I did it.
[687:34.41]Yes!
[687:35.11]It's over.
[687:35.91]Bye.
[687:36.87]I win.
[687:37.69]I win the game.
[687:58.02]I'm not alt-tabbing.
[687:59.53]I can't even react to winning.
[688:00.61]Stop the graphics.
[688:01.27]Can't hear the cutscene.
[688:02.15]Do it again.
[688:03.43]Sorry, you can YouTube it.
[688:29.12]He sounds manic.
[688:30.28]I mean, I probably am.
[689:02.24]And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the time that Gerber985 lost his fucking mind and four years off of the end of his life.
[689:10.88]He was going to make it to 65.
[689:16.00]Well, that was a game.
[689:16.66]That was wild.
[689:17.02]Simpson's here to run.
[689:31.74]that guy deserves such a probing who are these people I never saw them anyway
[689:54.34]Next Simpsons game.
[689:55.60]No.
[689:55.82]Okay, I'm going to be honest with you guys.
[689:58.58]I did not think for a second.
[690:01.53]Everyone was like, I'll play Simpsons Hit and Run.
[690:03.75]Oh, it's funny Mark Simpson.
[690:05.85]And you drive around and you pick up stuff.
[690:07.87]I didn't think this was going to be a hard game.
[690:20.34]It was very hard, though.
[690:22.44]I'm shaking right now.
[690:24.14]First impressions?
[690:25.76]Um... Pretty good.
[690:27.50]I wouldn't... I... I wouldn't wish what I just did on my worst enemy.
[690:31.71]Alright, well, I... Have fun game, though.
[690:35.31]Alright, Jeremy.
[690:37.17]Thanks.
[690:38.09]Thanks for that insight.
[690:41.27]Good insight, Jeremy.
[690:47.24]That concludes the first, um... The first rerun.
[690:54.66]uh yeah hey 11 and a half hour stream except I didn't do it uh thank you everybody for watching this I wanted to do this a while ago but I didn't I wasn't sure what to start with because it's one of those things where this is the first time I've ever done this and
[691:12.33]You know, I don't do stuff like this.
[691:14.59]I don't just run reruns or... This is an 11 and a half hour rerun.
[691:21.24]And I was kind of scared to do it at first because I, you know... I didn't know what people were going to say, what people were going to think about it.
[691:29.36]But I hope you liked it.
[691:32.62]It was the most voted thing to see and the most voted thing to do.
[691:37.68]Never do it again.
[691:41.26]Yeah, I'm surprised that there are this many people here.
[691:45.18]But as of now, you can expect... Like I said, on Sunday, we're going to do this again.
[691:53.21]Same deal.
[691:54.17]I'm going to play an old stream that people have really wanted to be shown with chat.
[691:59.79]And we'll hang out.
[692:00.47]I'll pop in from time to time like I did today.
[692:02.39]I'm just going to kind of exist.
[692:06.25]We'll do it again on Sunday.
[692:08.39]And depending how the next week or two goes...
[692:13.97]I'm going to either come back.
[692:18.39]Like, let's say this treatment that I'm on right now works pretty well.
[692:22.71]And it solves a major part of my problems.
[692:25.67]I'm just going to come back.
[692:27.37]And we'll just go back to normal within the next couple weeks.
[692:32.42]Now, if that doesn't happen, and I'm still searching, then, you know, obviously I'm going to keep doing it.
[692:41.80]But as it stands right now, the idea is to be back somewhere in the first or second week of July.
[692:48.19]That's what I'm hoping for.
[692:55.21]Will the green screen be the first 100 stream?
[693:00.13]I actually don't know.
[693:01.21]I don't know what the first thing... It probably will be the green screen because that was the last thing I did, so...
[693:11.37]I actually kind of enjoyed this.
[693:13.93]Maybe every once every hour or two, I kind of sat down and was just watching with you guys and just hanging out.
[693:19.80]It's kind of fun to relive some of these more...
[693:25.46]These more long streams, these more, I mean, let's just put them in a category.
[693:29.86]Like, classic streams, I would put them in.
[693:33.50]You know, New Vegas is going to be one of them too.
[693:38.48]I have not, I probably am going to sit there and watch that New Vegas stream with you guys.
[693:43.58]That's one of the first streams I ever did.
[693:45.48]That's one of the first real streams I ever did.
[693:48.36]Who knows what the fuck I said back then.
[693:50.10]It's going to be wild.
[693:53.29]He's an egomaniac.
[693:55.37]Well, I'm just saying.
[693:57.31]It's fun to go back and just kind of see what you guys say.
[694:00.95]It's fun.
[694:04.87]Do an Overwatch stream rerun?
[694:06.75]No, I'm not going to do that.
[694:12.50]Finish this off.
[694:18.34]Again, I'm incredibly surprised at the turnout.
[694:21.40]I was really expecting like less than a thousand people to come and watch this.
[694:27.24]So you have blown my expectations completely out of the water for stuff like a rerun stream.
[694:35.41]People thought it was live.
[694:36.39]Well, that's what I kept on putting that in.
[694:38.55]That's why I kept like chiming in and I kept on putting the thing on the screen and I tried to make the title because I didn't want people to think I was like pulling one over on you.
[694:52.40]700,000 games, that's probably another one.
[694:54.15]Yeah.
[694:59.42]I never thought it was live.
[695:03.27]But yeah, it's good to see you guys again.
[695:07.43]I'll see you again on Sunday.
[695:09.01]We'll do this again.
[695:09.63]And over the course of the next week, I'm still trying to figure this out.
[695:13.75]I'm on treatments right now.
[695:17.14]I was on steroids a couple weeks ago.
[695:19.14]It didn't do anything.
[695:19.84]I'm on antibiotics now because it was determined that I have a potential prostate infection.
[695:27.49]I don't know.
[695:27.99]Maybe this is it.
[695:29.65]Maybe this shit just fucked me all up.
[695:31.38]I don't know.
[695:32.24]We'll find out real soon.
[695:38.20]Yeah, if you weren't here at the beginning of the stream, I gave some updates on the medical stuff.
[695:43.25]I still have a bunch of scans.
[695:44.93]I'm waiting for some of those to go through.
[695:47.17]I have, obviously, have to wait for results for some of those things.
[695:51.35]One of the things I did get tested for, I had my prostate examined, and it turned out that I have a bad prostate or something.
[696:01.06]I have an infected prostate, like prostatitis.
[696:04.65]And that could be one of the reasons why I'm getting some of this pain.
[696:08.82]But it might be two or three things going on at the same time.
[696:11.14]That's why this has been so odd.
[696:14.40]So I'm on antibiotics for that, and we'll see after the stint of this.
[696:17.04]If it's gone, then holy shit, what a fucking easy fix that was.
[696:20.42]Look at me, let's go back to normal.
[696:22.38]I really hope that's what happens.
[696:24.88]But I'm not going to be too overly optimistic about it because... Obviously this has been more than a year or two going on now, and I don't want to just say that's the end.
[696:32.93]Oh, this is it!
[696:35.07]Because I've done that before I've been like yep.
[696:37.11]That's probably it it's over and it wasn't that that wasn't what the problem was He didn't study for his prostate exam That was pretty funny
[696:59.44]I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[697:00.98]Thanks, everybody.
[697:01.54]There was a shitload of people that have, like, subbed and everything, but... I do want to continue to adhere to the reasons why I left.
[697:09.33]And... I really want to just, like, stop talking and just shut up and not overexert.
[697:15.05]Even though I've come- I came in here a bunch of times and I was fucking around, I can't help myself.
[697:18.76]I really can't.
[697:19.78]If this- Look, I'm like a bug attracted to a light.
[697:23.16]If there's a stream on and there's a microphone present...
[697:26.90]I'm gonna use it.
[697:27.88]I'm gonna turn it on and just fucking do something.
[697:30.13]I can't help it.
[697:30.91]I have to.
[697:33.81]Raid, raid, raid, raid, raid Vinny, raid Vinny.
[697:36.39]Is Vinny live?
[697:38.93]Who is live right now?
[697:39.73]I've been so far away from the whole entire everything.
[697:42.84]I've been so far from everything.
[697:47.42]What do we got here?
[697:52.32]Uh, guys, Vinny's not even live.
[697:56.15]Oh, yeah.
[697:57.65]Why is he all the way down here?
[697:58.67]Why is he not at the top of my thing?
[698:04.59]Yeah, go say hi to Vinny.
[698:11.19]He just started.
[698:12.01]Well, there you go.
[698:12.62]What a perfect time.
[698:13.38]Hey, and when he asked you what I was playing... Oh, man.
[698:21.52]We've watched an 11 and a half hour rerun with him.
[698:28.74]But thanks again, guys.
[698:29.76]I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[698:30.90]I haven't decided what it's going to be, but you'll know either on Saturday night or Sunday morning.
[698:35.58]Good night.
[698:36.42]Goodbye.
[698:37.06]It's great to hear your voice again.
[698:40.68]Well, your typing voice.
