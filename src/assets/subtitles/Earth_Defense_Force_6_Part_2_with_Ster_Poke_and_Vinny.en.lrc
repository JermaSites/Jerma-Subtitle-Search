[ve:60.16.100]

[00:06.79]I am back.
[00:08.83]I'm already in the lobby.
[00:10.65]Okay, I'm in the lobby, right?
[00:31.27]Alright.
[00:32.77]Boy, it's time again.
[00:33.77]I was thinking about this all week.
[00:36.17]really not really oh because if you were we could have played or something I'm an edf enjoyer I I wouldn't have been able to but I'm happy to be playing now okay alright Ster can you explain just quickly it's just we got like different items now or something
[00:53.85]There's a small mod that's on the EDF Nexus that I made them install because that's what I make people do when they play games with me is install random mods and it's just rebalances some of the bad weapons brings back some of the EDF 5 balance because a whole bunch of things got nerfed for no reason and Like it gives air Raider back turrets and stuff like that that they don't have that they used to have and
[01:20.76]It's just some simple stuff.
[01:21.96]We back.
[01:23.12]Yeah, we back.
[01:23.96]So if something is red, that means I cannot use it or do I need a certain amount of crap?
[01:30.14]Hold on.
[01:30.92]You will.
[01:31.30]I'm going to change the mission down to... What kind of things are we dealing with here?
[01:37.50]Bugs or aliens?
[01:39.64]We're going to be dealing with people.
[01:42.04]Okay.
[01:42.36]What?
[01:44.15]That's not correct.
[01:45.81]That's crazy.
[01:48.71]No, dude.
[01:49.71]Come on.
[01:54.64]okay that's what it says in game right now that's what okay okay this one is called where do we even leave off last time the goddamn aliens we're going on a best of tour I'm trying to remember which mission one of them is
[02:25.59]How did you convince them to play this boomer-ass game?
[02:29.19]Bro, I don't even know how long you should be timed out for, but it's at least an hour.
[02:34.82]At least three.
[02:35.98]You think so?
[02:37.42]Not hours, just three, anything.
[02:39.14]At least a few years until he gets our age and understands what the fuck he's saying.
[02:45.06]Yeah, just wait until you get old enough.
[02:46.28]Wait until you're like a boomer, too, and then you'll get it.
[02:49.60]And you can come back in the chat and talk.
[02:57.70]It's kind of hard to explain without playing it, how addictive this game actually is.
[03:04.59]So I'll try.
[03:05.21]It's very addictive.
[03:09.03]Very good game.
[03:09.59]Alright, well if Ster is not ready, I want to double check my shit.
[03:15.81]I enjoyed it a lot.
[03:16.67]I think the aliens really pissed me off though, I'm not gonna lie.
[03:20.05]Are you talking, no, the aliens, you mean like the octopus creatures?
[03:23.03]Yeah.
[03:23.27]Like the metal?
[03:23.77]Those things just annoyed me.
[03:25.59]They were awful.
[03:27.03]they have nice guns for it they're horrible uh we might reset I'm trying to find a mission I don't know which one it is uh yeah the runs that are red Jerma we have some that are a little bit higher level than oh so we can't use them can we yeah can we use yellow yeah I don't know why they're yellow
[03:52.61]That is very weird.
[03:53.35]Okay.
[03:54.77]Well, I will use this.
[04:01.27]Ooh, I'll try this too.
[04:10.08]Use this high level weapons as possible, I think.
[04:17.03]Oh, OK.
[04:17.65]And you know, I'm going to go for the hybrid protector.
[04:21.45]Someone said they made this UI in Excel.
[04:25.93]I mean, listen, I don't.
[04:26.97]I don't disagree.
[04:28.43]If you figure it out eventually.
[04:37.85]yeah it's it's very very interesting it's an interesting sound it makes it's just a sound that makes every time you play something it's like a cat yeah oh it's not this one I'm trying to find a specific one the literal this is the whole lore it's very important
[05:07.24]So wait, how did someone port over a mission from five into six?
[05:10.22]Is that easy?
[05:12.14]Same game.
[05:12.86]Oh, good point.
[05:13.96]Alright.
[05:17.90]It is a very similar video game to the last one.
[05:30.14]Alright, let's do it.
[05:31.02]This isn't it.
[05:31.58]What?
[05:36.34]One more.
[05:36.74]One more look through.
[05:39.39]Our quarterback is fumbling the ball.
[05:42.59]I thought it'd be easy to find.
[05:43.79]I know exactly what I'm looking for.
[05:45.41]You know what I mean?
[05:46.33]Wait, is that why they named themselves Nickelback?
[05:49.63]Quarterback?
[05:50.19]Nickelback?
[05:52.80]Wait a second.
[05:56.32]Is that why?
[05:56.88]We'll just do these in order and we'll run into it.
[06:05.17]that why it's within the next few yo vinny can you look that up I don't know Chad is that right alright let's go wait this mod gave my character like ass what the hell huh yeah my character looks different
[06:24.09]oh yeah we're in the future or in the past now before Earth was destroyed he gave me the bbl mod yeah so so you really looking a little proceed with caution a little wild don't stray too far from the tanks alright stay near the tanks oh oops I've been going the wrong way the whole time where is the mission this is not even close actually was this the right one sir no
[06:57.50]Oops.
[07:02.70]Hey, guys.
[07:04.76]Oh, someone has deployed a VJ.
[07:05.92]What are you doing?
[07:07.28]My chat figured it out.
[07:09.80]My chat figured it out.
[07:11.76]This is my favorite mission of all of them.
[07:14.19]I'm sorry.
[07:14.79]This is so important.
[07:16.93]Okay.
[07:17.33]It's his birthday, man.
[07:18.23]And if they're wrong, I get to ban like six people, so it's a double win.
[07:21.59]Okay.
[07:21.97]Alright.
[07:22.63]Alright.
[07:23.71]You got a red weapon on again now.
[07:26.98]wanted to use that fine yeah well you can't kick Ster it can it's his birthday and let's see not uh what is it 11 days no you said turn up the volume of the npcs right yeah
[07:51.44]This is not the mission.
[07:52.32]So I get to ban like six people?
[08:02.16]Even my wife said this was the correct one.
[08:05.99]Oh my God, you got to ban your wife?
[08:07.35]Send her a warning.
[08:09.11]It's unfortunate that I have to.
[08:12.55]Damn, dude.
[08:14.53]Now my chat's upset and they're saying just play normally.
[08:17.75]It's your fault that you picked the wrong one.
[08:21.86]Sounds like the whole house is coming down over there.
[08:27.00]Sir, you're becoming the mission guy.
[08:29.40]Okay, well, whatever.
[08:30.26]This is a fun one.
[08:31.02]We're going to do this one.
[08:33.00]I know for sure this is a fun one, but it's not the one.
[08:38.40]Map guy.
[08:39.28]I'm usually settings guy.
[08:40.82]Vinny's breaking the base in your car?
[08:43.35]Why are you telling me...
[08:45.68]I'm not breaking the bass in anyone's car.
[08:47.20]What does that mean?
[08:47.92]I have a bassy voice, but it's not that bassy.
[08:50.10]I think they are pumping the stream, just driving around like it's music.
[08:55.63]What are you talking about?
[08:57.49]What is this?
[08:58.51]Look at these guys.
[09:00.47]Is that a little mini Master Chief?
[09:03.21]Look at that thing.
[09:04.97]It does look like Master Chief.
[09:08.51]Oh, yeah, they look like a Master Chief Funko Pop.
[09:13.35]It's the frogs with armor on.
[09:16.19]My chat's naming what mission is in EDF5 is what the issue was.
[09:20.31]Yeah, that's a cool excuse.
[09:26.71]But, I mean, justice will not be served until there are multiple bands handed out.
[09:32.34]I'll get to it later.
[09:33.30]Chat, do these grenades recharge?
[09:37.77]Does anyone know?
[09:39.11]They do.
[09:39.37]Yeah, all grenades should recharge.
[09:41.14]Oh, okay.
[09:42.68]I don't have a good gun.
[09:44.64]Can we reset?
[09:45.76]Are you serious?
[09:47.28]No, no, I'm joking.
[09:49.24]Okay.
[09:49.62]Because I could reset all day.
[09:51.70]They're coming over here.
[09:52.72]They're scary.
[09:53.50]They're spiders.

[14:55.68]Wow, this is not an easy mission by any means.
[14:58.84]Oh boy, this is bad.
[15:00.58]I'm running over to you for now.
[15:05.11]Tell Ster to continue from the missions last from last time.
[15:10.53]Are you telling me that?
[15:12.27]That's what a chat member told me to tell you.
[15:15.25]I'm wondering, what do you think, Ster?
[15:17.06]Is this too much for us Bappies?
[15:19.22]This is not many missions ahead of where that is.
[15:25.83]A few hundred?
[15:26.85]I think I need a sniper rifle.
[15:35.43]Wait, is this a mission from 5 or is it this game?
[15:40.64]It's from this game, I'm pretty sure.
[15:43.14]I think they revisit some missions with the new items and some new enemies maybe.
[15:51.50]It's a mission from 5 but revisited, I see.
[15:56.28]It's that it's on hard mode and Ster as a veteran player.
[15:59.10]Oh, okay.
[16:04.81]Oh, no, we were playing on hard last time.
[16:06.21]This isn't that far ahead.
[16:08.81]This is a hard mission.
[16:11.53]This is a very hard mission, but it's not quite over yet.
[16:17.87]Gary, you're alive.
[16:19.35]Thank you.
[16:28.27]There we go, there we go, there we go.
[16:33.05]I hear the anime girls.
[16:34.59]I think I just, I accidentally just shot a rocket over there.
[16:36.75]Man, I got nowhere to go.
[16:39.15]Fuck.
[16:51.64]Please get away from me.
[16:54.46]We are soldiers, Raiden.
[16:58.58]how do you just not die instantly oh I have been for sure alright let me okay if I run over here I think I can get you what the where is this coming from Vinny vinyl I'm back I'm back alright
[17:31.24]I forgot there's also friendly fire.
[17:32.60]So there's also there's also a tank that's been here.
[17:35.31]I don't know someone called in a tank.
[17:36.81]I just did like I just threw it over there.
[17:41.15]I think we're OK.
[17:44.25]The next wave maybe we just try to not to pick up stuff before we kill everything.
[17:50.25]Yeah.
[17:51.82]There's one more spider over there.
[17:54.48]Not really doing a whole lot of damage against this fella.
[17:59.64]Those frogs are big mode.
[18:01.68]I'm getting in the tank.
[18:06.64]They got all the gear on.
[18:07.50]They got the power armor.
[18:08.66]They really are getting me to want to reread all of the lore of the vaults.
[18:15.38]He's very missed so bad.
[18:22.16]Yeah, there we go.
[18:23.10]Hit him with the rocket.
[18:31.48]gonna hit him in the head okay okay that's good nice aim uh aiming the okay aiming the tank it feels like it's way too fast and way too slow at the same time am I the only one that thinks that never tried it a fencer is like that all the time this truck is terrible
[18:58.65]My weapons are not it Dude what is what am I having so much trouble driving over here?
[19:13.54]Zero zero Yeah, you get zeros until their armor breaks
[19:26.09]Did we get a recap?
[19:26.79]I missed the part where the spiders got big.
[19:28.11]They've been big.
[19:30.41]Alright, cool.
[19:35.23]Did we get everything?
[19:36.85]I think we got everything, yeah.
[19:40.20]Damn, alright.
[19:41.74]That worked out.
[19:43.10]Yeah, we did it.
[19:43.74]We did it.
[19:44.52]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:46.12]Get a lot of things from that mission, too.
[19:48.90]I got a lot of, like, very... I mean, that's a bigger...
[19:53.17]It's a harder mission than I'm used to, but I got a lot of good stuff from it.
[20:07.72]Yeah, that is it.
[20:10.24]When it's yellow, what does that mean?
[20:11.88]If a level is yellow?
[20:16.94]I have no idea what yellow means.
[20:21.45]I went back two missions so actually some of the things you just equip the 12s it won't let you use oh I see this is the one I want it what are the enemies you'll be you'll be fully caught up this is with the uh frog okay frog enemies I'm just gonna keep the same thing I think
[20:49.59]Yellow is the max limit for that particular mission.
[20:51.68]Oh, I see.
[20:52.52]Okay.
[20:55.98]Cool.
[20:56.46]Okay.
[20:56.72]I got some good stuff.
[20:57.60]I'm ready.
[21:00.04]Oh, it means that they have the same level.
[21:01.44]Interesting.
[21:15.97]Okay.
[21:16.96]I'm ready to kill some bugs.
[21:29.43]That's going to make the chat member watching from the car like the car is going to start shaking.
[21:36.03]Alright, guys, I'm going to call a taxi and.
[21:44.73]Oh, look out.
[21:49.98]You didn't say there were flying machines here.
[21:53.56]You said frogs.
[21:56.96]A bit of both.
[21:59.74]This is a bilingual mission.
[22:01.04]I'm getting fucking plastered.
[22:05.26]Oh, I just... Oops, I just shot our own ship.
[22:09.57]Oops.
[22:10.79]Oh, God, I'm already dead?
[22:16.93]Okay, you've already been introduced to a lot of the plot.
[22:20.29]They have more technology and we have bravery.
[22:25.06]Thank you, Star.
[22:25.72]Alright, this is the important one.
[22:27.90]There's a mothership.
[22:28.72]The mothership is attacking Earth.
[22:29.98]This is the worst loadout.
[22:31.10]These ships...
[22:37.57]Oh, Vinny.
[22:38.85]Yeah, I'm quite dead.
[22:40.55]Well, this is neat.
[22:51.92]This is a taxi.
[22:54.48]Anywhere you want to go?
[22:55.18]I just want to live.
[22:58.13]Yeah.
[22:59.09]These drones will be referred to as type two drones.
[23:03.57]Oh, alright.
[23:04.27]Good.
[23:04.65]Just in case we didn't know.
[23:08.84]type 2 diabetes yeah I've got a grenade launcher and a very inaccurate gun so this this might be a little tough we're doing it I think okay oh no I just saw aliens
[23:34.95]I mean, I also can't hurt them very much, but we've been fighting those outer space monsters all this time.
[23:40.74]It's the right mission.
[23:41.64]Yeah.
[23:43.58]I'm not talking about monsters.
[23:45.78]I'm talking.
[23:46.32]No, I got this.
[23:46.94]I don't believe it.
[23:47.56]Alright, I'm in the car.
[23:52.80]We are soldiers, brave and strong.
[23:56.72]Why are you in the car?
[23:59.16]why am I in the car because I'm I want to be sure where do you want to go I want to go to where the aliens yeah humanoid aliens what was that about I heard my name what were you saying feels like it's going to explode like humans one head two eyes with hands and feet one head almost identical to humans I play edf for the story exclusively
[24:31.27]Hey, they keep coming back.
[24:32.42]Are you still in my car?
[24:35.08]That sucks.
[24:35.68]No, no, I got up.
[24:36.28]I'm getting my own car.
[24:44.28]Yeah, I can't even reach these fucking things most of the time.
[24:46.67]Until they swoop.
[24:47.39]Whoops.
[24:58.48]Go ahead and save that for later because there's no way I'm going to be able to hit anything with that.
[25:04.36]Oh my God.
[25:11.53]I thought I had the shotgun out.
[25:13.01]I can't hit anything.
[25:14.47]I'm fighting from the ground.
[25:25.78]That one is freaking out.
[25:28.06]And what about a sniper rifle?
[25:29.58]Or a salt rifle or something?
[25:32.86]I have a salt rifle.
[25:34.26]It shoots salt at bugs.
[25:38.51]Oh, the salt guns in real life?
[25:40.95]Yeah.
[25:41.13]Do you, like, feel bad ever?
[25:44.45]Of course I do, but the mayor put out a fucking hit on these spotted lanternflies, which are an invasive species.
[25:51.93]The mayor was like, you got to kill this many number of bugs, otherwise we take away your license.
[25:56.69]I'm like, alright, I guess I'll do that.
[25:59.11]Wait, what?
[26:01.80]You get quests?
[26:02.92]There's an invasive species that's in New York called the spotted lanternfly, which has mucus that fucks up trees.
[26:10.64]And I'm not even kidding.
[26:12.82]The mayor was like, it is New York's duty to kill these bugs.
[26:16.92]What?
[26:17.92]The other states can't handle this job.
[26:20.56]Oh, shit.
[26:21.68]We got incoming.
[26:24.16]I finally can be useful.
[26:26.22]I need health.
[26:32.21]How much XP do you get for each bug?
[26:34.85]It's like one.
[26:36.53]How many kills you got right now?
[26:37.67]What's your KD?
[26:39.40]KD, oh God, the D is huge.
[26:42.28]We'll start with that, alright?
[26:43.98]And then second thing I'll say is the K, at least three.
[26:50.35]Oh.
[26:51.09]It's your duty.
[26:53.15]Did I back up into a ravine?
[26:55.57]Are you fucking kidding me?
[26:57.27]Oh God, here they are.
[27:05.15]They're aliens!
[27:08.81]Alright, everybody back up.
[27:15.19]Back up.
[27:16.09]They start to overwhelm very quickly.
[27:19.47]It's our voice.
[27:20.43]Very quickly.
[27:21.27]Oh no!
[27:21.57]Oh, he was waiting for me to look at him.
[27:44.51]I need that help.
[27:45.17]I feel like they've been here.
[27:46.27]They haven't just finally landed on Earth.
[27:47.77]They've been here for a while.
[27:49.43]Well, yeah, because we were in the future.
[27:50.77]I just died.
[27:51.23]In the starting mission.
[27:52.09]Gotta get the fuck out of here.
[27:53.57]Oh, this is a flashback.
[27:55.05]Yeah.
[27:55.87]This is their very first time landing?
[27:59.85]Yeah.
[28:00.83]Oh, okay.
[28:01.51]I see why you wanted us to do this now.
[28:05.01]They look like they're talking.
[28:06.75]I love that line.
[28:10.05]They could be talking to each other.
[28:11.59]Are these old lines from a previous game or are these re-recorded?
[28:14.25]These are the old game lines.
[28:16.39]That's awesome.
[28:16.85]Hey, I'll take a res.
[28:17.71]I'm dead.
[28:20.21]Yeah, Ster, it's just you now, bud.
[28:27.83]Oh, really?
[28:36.31]If we restart this mission, I would like to bring a long-range weapon instead of a shotgun.
[28:40.49]Hold your ground!
[28:41.59]No way we're handing over this city!
[28:46.81]I can almost call in the taxi and I'm gonna go get everybody.
[28:49.27]They're attacking!
[28:51.21]The enemies are hiding in the shadows of buildings!
[28:54.75]Those be-ass-tids!
[28:56.57]Move in!
[28:57.47]Be-ass-tids!
[28:59.41]He added three syllables.
[29:00.65]Those be-ass-tids!
[29:03.94]Show them what the EDF infantry is made of.
[29:07.04]We are soldiers brave and strong.
[29:11.24]Our muscles will protect you all from any harm.
[29:14.44]Raise up your voices in a battle cry.
[29:18.34]Form a bandit band on them.
[29:22.10]Crossfire!
[29:22.54]We are soldiers brave and strong.
[29:26.78]We are soldiers brave and strong.
[29:30.75]Windows G enable.
[29:34.79]Fall back!
[29:35.97]Fall back!
[29:37.42]I'm sad now.
[29:38.30]I'm sad now.
[29:40.46]Hey!
[29:40.74]Save me!
[29:45.80]Trying!
[29:47.12]Hey!
[29:47.72]Save me!
[29:48.72]Enemy on the left, too!
[29:50.90]Hey!
[29:51.62]Thanks, man, but saving me was probably unwise.
[29:54.31]The hey is so like... Hey!
[29:56.69]Hey!
[30:00.36]I never got my car.
[30:02.18]He's screaming.

[30:07.31]Oh, I'm dead again.
[30:08.59]Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[30:16.09]I think they've rolled the windows up in the car, by the way.
[30:18.90]Like who people were driving around blasting this room.
[30:22.62]They can recover fast, even during injury.
[30:24.78]Keep shooting till they're dead.
[30:26.77]Wow, my corpse just got exploded around.
[30:30.23]I got stuck on a chair!
[30:32.26]Hey!

[35:44.20]It's alien flying ships.
[35:49.42]Yeah, watch out for the river.
[35:50.66]There's a little ravine that runs down the road and you are stuck there.
[35:55.54]Wait, you took my ambulance.
[35:57.52]I didn't even know you could drive it.

[36:14.00]Oh, that's nutso.
[36:14.76]We're all in this.
[36:17.82]Something is descending from the flying ship.
[36:19.70]Alright, we should do way better now.
[36:20.70]I can't believe it.
[36:21.25]They're aliens.
[36:23.05]Aliens are descending from the flying ship.
[36:24.99]Oh, yeah, the ravine.
[36:25.83]Okay.
[36:26.27]So that is the enemy's landing ship.
[36:29.47]Alright, here they come.
[36:32.45]The aliens have weapons.

[37:09.07]I hate this energy stuff, man.
[37:10.91]You get some better power cores later.
[37:13.11]That'll help you fly longer.
[37:14.21]If any fall back a little bit, they're gonna collapse behind us.
[37:16.80]They're onto the right here.
[37:20.38]They look like they're talking!
[37:22.84]That one's dead.
[37:30.46]Permission to engage the aliens granted.

[37:52.53]I'm coming in the back.
[37:57.21]Sir, be careful stepping in front of this gun.
[37:59.51]Fall back!
[38:00.83]You be careful.
[38:02.66]Hold your ground.
[38:03.58]No way we're handing over this city.
[38:06.54]No, you.
[38:11.28]They're attacking.
[38:13.86]The enemies are hiding in the shadows of buildings.
[38:17.28]Those bastards move in.
[38:19.99]Those bastards.
[38:23.23]Oh, he ducked under the bullet.

[38:32.51]Oh, they're behind us.
[38:35.61]He's like using cover.
[38:39.39]This missile launcher wasn't a great choice, I don't think.
[39:00.19]Actually, it's not that bad of a choice.
[39:03.45]It's pretty good.
[39:05.19]I got all the loot.
[39:06.37]They're using their own language.
[39:10.41]Get off the building.
[39:11.19]Oh yeah, no, this is great.
[39:15.51]I think there's a ton of damage.
[39:19.75]I don't even have to actually see where they are.
[39:25.06]The missiles just go to them.
[39:27.20]Do you have a guided rocket launcher?
[39:31.82]They're pretty cool.
[39:32.60]Guided rocket launcher.
[39:33.62]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[39:34.54]I got one that shoots like five missiles at a time, and it just, like, it knows where they are, even if they're behind buildings.
[39:39.47]It's awesome.
[39:41.95]Jerry.

[42:24.27]These are the red ants.
[42:25.55]If it's red ants.
[42:27.07]If you're in an ant's mouth, you can just hold the flamethrower down in their mouth.
[42:30.55]Great.
[42:32.07]Okay, I'll try it.
[42:33.37]Do you have flamethrower 2?

[43:45.22]I've researched aliens.
[43:47.14]You've researched a priest.
[43:48.72]I've done some research.
[43:51.16]And I've determined that after my research, I know no more than I did before my research.
[43:56.90]Don't get close.
[43:58.98]As long as you avoid, I mean, that didn't work out so great.
[44:02.41]They're out.
[44:02.73]Do you fly?
[44:06.55]That's a great question.
[44:09.95]Many players have been wondering for a long time.
[44:12.95]I don't know if I can help you there.
[44:16.47]We're just raining hell down on this.
[44:19.07]This is going kind of well.
[44:21.29]Even if they're fighting you.
[44:31.72]It's hard to, like, fly this thing.
[44:33.30]Geez.
[44:35.52]Why am I hitting the lens on the ground?
[44:40.96]You have to, like, keep... I think it's space.
[44:43.14]You have to, like, keep tapping to maintain altitude.
[44:45.94]Oh, it's tapping space.
[44:48.40]No, it's not.
[44:49.80]It, like, it turns the top spinnies on, on and off.
[44:55.64]I don't know.
[44:56.30]It's really awkward.
[44:57.06]Uh-oh, I'm dropping frames.
[44:59.01]Oh, no.
[45:03.25]Yeah, the propellers.
[45:05.68]Propellers, yeah.

[45:22.08]Oh, boy.
[45:30.37]Oh boy.
[45:31.59]I don't know if you guys can get in that or if it's just me.

[45:36.81]What Metal Gear?
[45:38.61]They came around from the shallow area.
[45:41.22]Oh, there you go.
[45:48.94]Oh, I like this mission.
[45:49.82]This is fun.
[45:51.04]Yeah, this is great.
[45:51.72]And the helicopter is awesome, even if it doesn't control very well.
[45:54.88]It's just kind of fun to use and just shoot.
[45:58.50]Do I get one?
[46:00.60]I think if you- you gotta find one.
[46:05.96]Um.
[46:07.08]Oh.
[46:07.90]Okay.
[46:08.36]I gotta get away from that.

[46:14.04]I'm okay, I'm okay.
[46:15.61]Alright.
[46:17.91]Is it fall damage?
[46:18.41]I'm just- Bauman.
[46:18.93]Uh, no fall damage.
[46:25.46]ships we don't have data on the thing is just must be a new enemy strategy what scale are we talking it's fun to watch all the ants in the distance crawl around the buildings are you rangers able to get in the mechs where is your mech yeah I can get it in there this tool did someone chat did someone raid me or was that all people just refreshing
[46:55.45]This is carrier.
[46:56.51]We'll head for the combat area again.
[46:57.91]And we'll take down the enemy.
[47:00.13]Can't stop shaking.
[47:01.29]There's a helicopter over there too, if anyone wants it.
[47:04.32]We'll send over another one.
[47:05.28]Oh, what should I do if my helicopter's out of ammo?
[47:07.04]Should I just like blow it up?
[47:08.56]Yeah.
[47:09.70]There's no reload.
[47:11.48]You just throw your helicopter in the ocean when you're done with it.
[47:15.04]Okay.
[47:15.28]Oh, I don't want to hit by that.
[47:17.70]Remove the safety device.
[47:20.17]Enter the air above the target.
[47:28.23]This mech is fun.
[47:28.97]I think it's I think it's a loot time.
[47:42.83]Yeah, it's definitely loot time.
[47:50.15]Oh, I gotta get out of this.
[47:52.15]I'm doing so much damage.
[47:54.01]The ants are just producing gibs from me shooting them with a flamethrower.
[47:56.95]It's kind of funny.
[47:58.03]That's what I call comedy.
[48:04.20]Oh, you're all the way over there.
[48:06.98]You went in deep.
[48:10.76]Oh, God.
[48:11.12]Oh, my God.
[48:11.82]I just saw all the ants behind me.
[48:13.00]Oh, my fucking God.
[48:14.50]Running.
[48:15.85]The Dorito ships are coming in.
[48:17.89]There's not much space to land on this terrain.
[48:20.62]Wing divers won't be at their full potential.
[48:23.48]Very careful.
[48:24.36]Wing diver is not a full potential.
[48:25.56]No need to worry about what?
[48:27.26]They just said that it's there's like a hazard for you or something, right?
[48:34.02]OK.
[48:38.73]Command says you can't do this.
[48:42.67]Well.
[48:43.21]Trying to stop me.
[48:52.29]That's good.
[48:52.71]Oh my god.
[48:59.91]Whose mech is this?
[49:00.71]Uh, it's mine.
[49:02.46]I'm using it.
[49:05.28]Can you?
[49:06.26]Yeah.
[49:07.94]Sick.
[49:10.24]Why aren't you using it?

[50:54.32]Maybe not, maybe not.
[50:56.41]You guys alright over there?
[50:59.29]We got a bit of loot to collect, but I feel like we're all stuck in the ocean.
[51:02.89]You guys are all in the ocean.
[51:04.85]Yeah, this water situation is not good.
[51:07.69]The wing situation is crazy.
[51:11.63]Don't give up.
[51:13.03]How the fuck did those miss?
[51:17.59]That healing was so clutch.
[51:20.74]I'm trying to kill you.
[51:26.10]Okay, I'm dead again.
[51:26.82]It kills him.
[51:29.14]It just kills me.

[52:12.10]We've managed to avoid drowning.
[52:14.18]It's a lot of stuff.
[52:18.34]I got a lot of loot.
[52:19.52]Yeah, that's a lot of bugs.
[52:22.24]Big loot.
[52:23.24]That's a lot of freaking bugs.
[52:30.98]Hmm.
[52:45.37]acid shower prototype huh that seems silly I'm gonna try it multiple lock on device are we doing this mission or going to a higher level uh different um the other one I want to do is like mission 30 that's a bit higher so we can just go in order for a bit should have level 12 stuff I want to wear
[53:16.08]I think I'm going to skip this one because it's like purely flying things.
[53:22.28]I don't mind flying things as long as we know they're coming.
[53:28.48]I'm not a flying thing enjoyer.
[53:30.83]If you skip this one, let's go 12.
[53:32.51]Okay, that's cool.
[53:36.99]No, it's bad.
[53:38.19]Wait, wait, you're telling me the acid shower thing is bad?
[53:40.91]But look at it.
[53:41.43]It looks like a can of Raid.
[53:42.51]Is it poison?
[53:47.30]Can you guys watch the video I linked, or no?
[53:50.02]Not yet.
[53:51.80]I'll do that.
[53:53.50]I don't know how your things work.
[53:54.91]Yeah, I'll give it a look.
[54:01.83]XHitman reacts to Hitman 3.
[54:03.43]Yeah, that's what I would've did.
[54:20.37]Wow Yeah, that shit isn't Wow damn and he's a little gabagool too like he's like one of my people If any yeah, what is gabagool I
[54:49.32]Okay, but what what is I know they talk about gobble a lot I'm saying specifically what actually is gabagool
[55:09.34]this is the gabagool I mean what do you what do you want me to say about it you you want to know what it is the phrase yeah it's a meat it's it's like a dried like it's like a you know like a have you ever heard of salami dude I just called it a phrase have you ever heard of salami yeah it's kind of like a salami type meat but it's it's it's like a dryer okay I don't know how to explain it actually vinny is there any way you can watch the one I just linked you real quick
[55:40.58]Just now?
[55:41.04]Yeah, like, is there any way you can pull it off?
[55:43.37]While playing this?
[55:44.93]No, probably not.
[55:46.19]I think I've seen this.
[55:47.19]Hold up.
[55:49.43]I feel like you'd like this one.
[55:51.39]I'm not sure.
[55:52.93]Okay, I probably will.
[55:54.27]Give me a minute.
[55:55.40]Let me kill some frogs.
[55:56.78]This one is going to be so hard.
[56:00.72]People aren't paying attention to the game, and it's going to be hard.
[56:03.52]Oh, no.
[56:05.64]I'm killing them alright now.
[56:08.19]I love you guys.
[56:09.59]Now run!
[56:12.13]the civilians aren't don't forget grenade launcher is good wiping out the aliens okay I mean I just watched it and enemy elites have dropped that's a video you don't like it the big guns huh what is this problem that doesn't seem good two landing ships just entered the combat area
[56:41.89]Chips.
[56:43.43]I'm just staying back here at the sniper rifle.
[56:48.02]Forget that.
[56:53.54]Oh, they're coming all the way over here.
[56:54.52]Never mind, I'm running.
[56:56.14]Dude, it's more of these aliens.
[56:59.25]What do they want?
[57:03.87]I'll take the ones that are in the northern part of the city.
[57:14.08]I know chat member that was telling me not to sprint during combat as a ranger.
[57:17.04]I understand.
[57:17.58]I understand.
[57:23.94]Do it anyway.
[57:25.06]Do not go behind the building.
[57:28.18]Shit.
[57:36.80]Do whatever you want.
[57:38.02]I'm assuming these flamethrower turrets do not respawn.
[57:42.30]Oh, there's red frogs now.
[57:44.08]uh I believe they do three landing ships just entered the combat area they do okay yeah I believe you have to like get points to refill them which is just kill aliens okay certain amount of kills as points got it dude I need to think of this because what is the game kills his points I'm driving crazy what's going on Jerma
[58:10.84]I'm sprinting and I'm not really moving and it's taking me a long time to get going and there's a game, like an old game, that does this exact same thing.
[58:20.02]I can't figure it out.
[58:21.79]It's like a run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, and then you start running.
[58:26.59]No, not Sonic.
[58:27.29]Yeah, I know which one you're talking about, but that does sound familiar.
[58:31.58]I mean, that's like Super Mario, kind of.
[58:33.86]You've got like that ground friction.
[58:36.12]No, it's very specific, like kind of sluggish run, like run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, and then you finally start moving.
[58:42.65]Oh my God, I am flying now.
[58:45.47]I'm dead.
[58:45.83]They're covered in armor.
[58:48.45]Where do we even aim?
[58:52.17]Oh, I'm back.
[58:52.85]Okay, I was looking at the gobble goal video.
[58:55.61]This is going to be tough.
[59:02.28]Where do we even aim?
[59:03.08]I don't know.
[59:05.72]So Vinny, you don't fuck with Roblox?
[59:08.90]I don't because I don't really... It gets into a tricky topic for a stream if you want to keep things light.
[59:16.34]Oh, child labor.
[59:17.20]I still haven't played it.
[59:25.23]Aside from child labor, the games are pretty fire.
[59:28.33]I believe it.
[59:28.95]I believe it.
[59:30.20]Yeah, kids make some really sick shit.
[59:31.84]Why is my computer freaking out?
[59:52.13]the conflicts with our neighbors do we use guns and bombs no that is not how it should be done we engage in dialog that is the only way to resolve conflicts this time we can certainly resolve our issues through dialog as well yeah we can talk to the frogs and resolve our issues through the dialog with the frogs for them large flies but isn't like isn't like 80 of all of Earth destroyed at this point
[60:19.02]no this is this no oh well you take attention pay attention bro you we were on mission 28 mission 14 mission 44. yeah we're jumping we jumping you're taking us on a time travel do you see all the buildings around us somewhere else that's not what we're seeing on the scene you think this is Earth too we could be in a different city or even country or something maybe it's just the next city
[60:46.89]Next city over.
[60:48.86]Yeah.
[60:51.76]No pants gang.
[60:53.34]I guess.
[60:59.34]This is a bad idea.
[61:02.56]I liked it.
[61:03.26]I liked the poker.
[61:04.06]I thought it was good.
[61:05.06]Oh, you watched it?
[61:06.20]Yeah.
[61:06.40]Oh, I don't think you liked it.
[61:09.58]No, I liked it.
[61:10.20]Did you ever watch the just the two of us, but it was an alien and he's like, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[61:18.90]What is going on?
[61:20.74]What is just the two of us?
[61:22.67]It's just a song.
[61:24.15]It's a song.
[61:27.07]It's a song.
[61:27.77]Oh!
[61:27.93]And the alien gets all gleby.
[61:30.05]Remember that when the alien got gleby?
[61:33.01]Yeah, no, I like that.
[61:33.93]I fuck with that one.
[61:35.15]Yeah.
[61:36.03]Yeah.
[61:39.87]I have another one.
[61:42.09]I'm available to watch said other one.
[61:45.04]oh minion bush another time another time we'll do it we'll talk about next time okay next time alright what's on what's on tap here uh I actually like this loadout a lot I think this is the one where you destroy the uh the spawner pillars I can handle that
[62:27.86]Use the awful bike.
[62:29.38]I don't think I want to use the awful bike.
[62:32.33]I don't even have the bike yet.
[62:33.41]That's kind of interesting.
[62:35.25]I feel like you get it pretty early.
[62:36.73]I want to try the railgun, but I haven't had a chance to.
[62:40.59]The whale gun?
[62:43.59]Yes.
[62:44.84]Specifically for killing whales.
[62:48.52]Vinny, that was a concerningly good impression.
[62:51.74]Oh, of just the two of us, Glebe?
[62:53.70]Yeah.
[62:53.86]Yeah.
[62:55.46]uh hash browns and noodles can we get a consensus for for a food choice noodles noodles okay wait are you ordering something no no just uh somebody in chat there's an NPC in the game when we were playing that walked up to you and said oh so you are uh you a ketchup guy or a soy sauce guy yeah ketchup depends on the food that's that's almost not fair because
[63:24.28]We need to take out that thing.
[63:26.56]That's super loud for you guys too!
[63:37.73]Dude, I turned my game volume down to almost zero.
[63:43.61]There's just a lot happening.
[63:45.79]I might have chosen the wrong weapons.
[63:49.35]Way to go underneath, right?
[63:51.30]Is that just a me thing, really?
[63:52.90]Because it was happening to me the other day.
[63:54.40]Soy sauce hot dog.
[63:58.50]It doesn't sound too terrible.
[64:00.50]We kind of annihilated that thing, though.
[64:03.30]The hot dog that I rave about from this one place in Manhattan that people don't believe is teriyaki pineapple bacon-wrapped hot dog with green onions on it.
[64:13.79]And you would not believe how good it is.
[64:15.45]It's stupidly good.
[64:16.76]Hot dogs, honestly, are just an amazing vehicle for every other food on Earth.
[64:23.14]Right.
[64:24.54]Right.
[64:28.61]I know what's better, though.
[64:29.51]Hmm?
[64:31.07]Rice.
[64:33.37]Yeah.
[64:34.63]Rice is good.
[64:35.23]Makes everything better.
[64:38.07]I don't know why I wanted to argue about it.
[64:39.95]I just really like rice.
[64:41.49]Right, you wouldn't go to bat for it too much.
[64:45.74]Yeah, no, I just would be a little weird.
[64:47.32]I like rice too, though.
[64:48.76]I like couscous.
[64:50.00]I've been enjoying that lately.
[64:52.46]If you put in uncooked hot dog and you wrap it in rice, it's sushi.
[64:56.62]No, that's not how that works, I don't think.
[65:00.19]Well, I think you do have to roll it up in seaweed or whatever.
[65:03.63]Oh, okay, now it's officially sushi, yeah.
[65:09.34]A hot dog?
[65:10.70]Raw?
[65:13.62]People eat raw hot dogs.
[65:14.60]I found out that's a thing that people do, yeah.
[65:16.56]They eat the raw hot dogs.
[65:17.72]Yeah, I knew a guy who did that.
[65:19.76]They are cooked, you know.
[65:20.84]Isn't a raw hot dog effectively bologna?
[65:24.08]Yeah, they call it a raw dog.
[65:28.10]Yeah.
[65:34.17]Androids are coming out of the anchors.
[65:36.47]You guys just been raw dogging?
[65:39.57]I was waiting for someone.
[65:42.65]Well, yeah, wrapped in rice.
[65:45.07]The ship dropped a teleport anchor.
[65:46.84]It's flooding the area with androids.
[65:49.02]No.
[65:50.72]I'll take care of the ships.
[65:51.68]If more androids keep coming, they'll outnumber us.
[65:54.66]Chat, this acid shower prototype is actually, like, bad.
[66:00.56]You told me it would be bad, and I didn't believe you.
[66:04.86]Oh, they got the fidget spinner.
[66:09.97]Don't worry about the ships.
[66:10.87]I've got it.
[66:11.23]I've got this.
[66:12.13]The primers!
[66:12.49]No!
[66:30.71]Alright, there's a few more ships back there.
[66:32.75]I'm gonna spew some acid onto their brains.
[66:35.49]Oh, it's so awkward, this weapon.
[66:40.66]I died.
[66:41.06]I'm... You guys alright?
[66:46.18]I'm... I'm... No, I'm not.
[66:56.39]Oh, there's a lot of people coming.
[66:58.57]Every time I pick wing diver, I die.
[67:02.76]I'm going to try to get poke.
[67:04.22]Wing diver and no rapier gun.
[67:08.10]If I get this E equals MC squared coming up here, I will annihilate the whole map.
[67:20.61]Alright, poke.
[67:21.01]I'm almost there.
[67:22.85]Take your time.
[67:24.33]I would run through, but I don't want to die running through.
[67:26.82]Actually, I have an opportunity.
[67:29.22]Watch this, poke.
[67:30.49]Oh, hang out in the green.
[67:32.72]It's going to be good for you.
[67:33.82]I'm healthy.
[67:40.88]I'm I'm good.
[67:44.20]Oh, this thing is.
[67:47.67]OK, sir, I am coming to get you.
[67:51.01]I got a shirt right here.
[67:51.91]You guys turn.
[67:52.73]This is Carolee Armor vehicles on the go.
[67:56.91]Okay, I've got the crazy thing.
[68:02.60]This thing, I'm ready to burn this thing down.
[68:07.74]Oh, he's ready to burn.
[68:09.18]Oh, you think I'm messing around?
[68:11.70]Oh, wait, did you call in the truck?
[68:14.04]I called in the Sonic radar.
[68:20.28]Let's go.
[68:22.18]What is this?
[68:23.20]A rail gun.
[68:27.90]Fuck you, aliens.
[68:32.60]Is it hurting?
[68:33.36]There's a shield.
[68:35.40]I'm trying to go underneath it.
[68:41.67]Oh, this is a two-person vehicle.
[68:43.51]Is it going under?
[68:44.43]Is it technically going under?
[68:46.55]No.
[68:47.79]Oh, my God, that noise.
[68:49.07]What am I on top of?
[68:50.51]Fucking train tracks?
[68:53.13]Why am I... I just... I think I...
[68:57.19]Got one shot and got flown across the screen.
[68:59.31]This is the map.
[69:02.51]Can't see shit.
[69:06.67]Actually might be able to sneak it up there.
[69:07.93]No, you're not going to get it.
[69:12.69]Oh my God, it's so hard to control.
[69:14.01]Actually, no, no, sorry.
[69:15.84]I'll just kill these things coming over here.
[69:29.16]Oh, it's so awkward, Chad.
[69:30.68]I cannot believe that didn't destroy it.
[69:33.60]Why did my tank get destroyed?
[69:35.40]I have to get out of this thing.
[69:39.48]Well, that was a huge waste.
[69:41.48]Wait, Jeremy, you didn't destroy my tank, did you?
[69:43.72]I don't.
[69:44.76]I was hitting it with a hot dog.
[69:46.62]Uh, I don't think I did.
[69:48.87]Oh.
[69:49.69]Did I actually, did I obliterate his tank?
[69:53.08]It's possible.
[69:56.08]It's possible.
[69:57.16]Sorry, I had the melt everything gun.
[70:02.45]Yeah, no, it melted.
[70:04.35]Yeah, it melted.
[70:06.75]I saw a red video.
[70:07.61]I'm so sorry.
[70:08.27]I just didn't even know what I was shooting at.
[70:21.77]Wait, you can walk on the inside of that?
[70:25.18]Jerma, can I ask you a question?
[70:28.06]As a new Simpsons fan, someone who's watching through season four and all of The Simpsons for the first time, at least the first couple seasons, are you like,
[70:38.12]Do you know all the episodes?
[70:40.20]Or are you like a mega Simpson fan?
[70:42.08]Or are you just like kind of casual Simpson?
[70:44.69]I'm a casual 90s Simpsons kind of guy.
[70:49.09]Like the old Treehouse of Horrors.
[70:52.02]You know, like I'll give you an example.
[70:53.82]That's a different show.
[70:56.10]what treehouse of horrors isn't that uh with the the feed me so that's what that is you're thinking of a different show no you're thinking of it he's wrong no we can move that's a movie that's a different thing entirely buddy but um little shop of horrors that is um so so you know the the 90s like uh I just watched camp crusty are you familiar with that episode if I just say the name of it like are you that kind of fan
[71:22.71]No, and I'll be really honest with you.
[71:25.06]I was a big fan of The Simpsons when I was younger.
[71:27.70]It was like one of my favorite shows.
[71:29.16]So there was like three or four years during that kind of the mid-90s seasons that I was like, oh my God, I love this show.
[71:34.92]Sideshow Bob hitting himself in the face with a rake.
[71:37.76]Like 10 times in the same episode.
[71:40.76]Yeah.
[71:41.16]It's classic comedy.
[71:44.00]Right.
[71:44.40]The rake bit.
[71:45.10]I like the rake bit.
[71:46.56]You like it when people get hurt.
[71:48.86]He hits himself in the face and he goes...
[71:54.53]flawless yeah I I really I I watched a little bit as a kid but I didn't understand it so I just kind of stopped but now I'm I'm going through those 90s episodes again they're really good you know what that's actually a really kind of interesting point it's right in front of us I probably should go back and watch like those early first like five to ten seasons like 15 seasons
[72:18.18]Yeah, it seems like you get a lot out of it.
[72:19.94]And like, you know, it was silly animation.
[72:22.58]But now that I'm older, I don't even know how I just did that noise.
[72:26.89]But now that I'm older, I can appreciate it more.
[72:30.63]And it's good.
[72:32.67]It's for kids and adults.
[72:33.75]That's what's cool about Simpson.
[72:35.04]I would definitely appreciate it more now.
[72:36.86]I feel like recently.
[72:38.68]Oh, my God.
[72:42.26]Need to tell us about the Hank Scorpio episode?
[72:44.34]I watched that one already.
[72:45.42]I love Seinfeld.
[72:46.84]I grew up watching Seinfeld, the Feld, but I like Curb a little bit more these days.
[72:50.61]I haven't really seen much Feld.
[72:52.39]Feld.
[72:58.11]I don't even know if there is, and I could just be wrong, but somebody like help me and correct me.
[73:04.95]Seinfeld is, I don't think there's a single bad episode of that entire show.
[73:11.64]They're just all, you could play them on repeat and start it over and you'd still be like, yeah, I'm willing to watch this entire thing again.
[73:20.24]It's great.
[73:23.28]Someone said the finale, another person in my chat said they're all bad.
[73:26.72]So I guess, yeah, we kind of should have prepared for that kind of answer.
[73:30.58]But no, it is a good show.
[73:31.92]I don't think it... From what I remember, I haven't seen the whole show, but... I like the finale.
[73:39.43]Yeah, the finale gets a lot of hate, doesn't it?
[73:43.38]They're all shitty people.
[73:45.46]They really are shitty people.
[73:48.34]For the finale of Curb, they kind of referenced the Seinfeld finale, and they played with it a little bit, and I thought that was excellent.
[73:58.70]I think... What the hell was that?
[74:00.93]What the fuck is wrong with that?
[74:03.07]We're talking about a TV show he doesn't get and he doesn't watch, so he's mad.
[74:06.65]I was going to say the Curb finale about the finale was a good finale reference.
[74:13.39]That's right.
[74:13.97]I liked it, but I don't know too much about the Feld finale myself.
[74:18.58]Yeah, Feld was shown in Times Square.
[74:21.52]That was a huge thing, I remember.
[74:23.16]As a kid, I was like, oh, my God, this is massive.
[74:25.62]Oh, I'm dead.
[74:27.08]Yeah, we got two down.
[74:27.74]It was in Times Square, the episode?
[74:29.74]They aired it in Times Square on a big screen.
[74:34.91]Really?
[74:35.79]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[74:36.67]It was a huge show.
[74:37.75]Everyone was watching it.
[74:38.51]Was it just disappointing everybody, apparently?
[74:40.59]Were people laughing?
[74:42.55]I don't know.
[74:42.99]I was in diapers.
[74:44.67]No, I wasn't.
[74:45.42]I was probably like 14.
[74:47.54]So you were in diapers?
[74:48.96]Yeah, I was 14.
[74:49.60]Yeah, basically.
[74:50.88]I think that Seinfeld was such a beloved show, and everybody thought it was so funny.
[74:55.62]And when they realized that it was over...
[74:59.59]And a lot of people thought it was over too soon.
[75:01.17]No, no, no.
[75:01.77]We wanted more seasons.
[75:03.71]And I think people were very upset about that, first of all.
[75:05.97]And they thought, wait a minute.
[75:06.76]This is the last episode we're getting of Seinfeld?
[75:09.00]You could do so much more.
[75:10.04]What the heck?
[75:10.98]I think that's where it comes from.
[75:12.96]Yeah, maybe.
[75:14.96]Yeah, the Feldverse.
[75:17.20]Enter the Feldverse.
[75:19.74]And then Curb Your Enthusiasm comes out.
[75:22.32]And it just is more of that.
[75:23.06]It's all you, Vinny.
[75:25.54]I don't know, who do I get?
[75:26.54]Stero or Jerma?
[75:27.02]You know what, Jerma's further away.
[75:29.04]Alright, I'm gonna get Jerma.
[75:31.53]I like Seinfeld more than Curb.
[75:33.67]That's just me, though.
[75:35.39]You're trying to be a little bit controversial right now.
[75:38.21]Oh wait, we all died.
[75:39.77]Yeah.
[75:42.43]I love Seinfeld and Curb equally for different reasons.
[75:48.51]Because I think Seinfeld, I like all the characters.
[75:51.82]You know what I mean?
[75:52.72]Curb is just like, the main guy carries it so hard.
[75:56.66]Yeah.
[75:56.88]That's all I think.
[75:58.30]I mean, the characters in Curb are good too.
[76:01.36]I like them.
[76:02.12]There's some that you don't like as much, but like, you know, remember Funkhauser?
[76:06.95]The best character ever.
[76:07.49]A woman's afraid of the size of her opening!
[76:09.63]That's literally the best character.
[76:11.35]I'm an orphan now.
[76:13.07]I'm an orphan.
[76:14.33]Yeah.
[76:14.85]I'm an orphan now, Larry.
[76:16.05]What do you mean you're an orphan?
[76:16.85]No, you're not.
[76:17.63]No, you're not.
[76:19.92]legendary fucking comedian honestly yeah Bob Einstein that dude was amazing you know what I liked friends yeah and that wasn't a yeah I didn't I actually didn't really watch it I didn't mind if it was on TV I wouldn't look forward to friends but if it was on TV I'd watch it
[76:41.12]I mean, yeah, I would... I mean, like everybody else, when the theme song came on, I would grab a serving spoon and I would put it towards my mouth and start, like, spinning around and, like, putting my foot in the air and singing and stuff with it.
[76:51.01]Like, I feel like everybody did that, though.
[76:54.45]What?
[76:54.65]Uh, this is a really big, difficult mission, but it is the companion mission to the other one earlier that I love.
[77:04.92]The aliens.
[77:07.08]Vinny, is your armor maxed out?
[77:08.74]Yes.
[77:09.62]You gotta be prepared on this one.
[77:11.13]prepare for this one yeah what enemy type all of them okay um yeah friends wasn't for me didn't work for me someone said the office in my chat I like the office yeah friends never worked for me either I was also again I was a kid and I didn't I didn't watch it as an adult but like I don't know it wasn't for me
[77:39.91]You're just being nice because I'm here.
[77:41.63]I'm not a big friends guy.
[77:43.69]If you said it was shit, I'm not going to be offended.
[77:46.60]I haven't watched enough of it to make that opinion is the problem.
[77:50.94]Wait, you were in friends?
[77:52.92]Yeah.
[77:55.94]Do I look like I know what a friend is?
[77:59.42]I had a dream about you last night.
[78:03.40]I was playing Valorant or some shitty game, and you were on the enemy team, and I was like, oh, dude, that's crazy.
[78:08.41]That's Pokémon, and we played, and I was like, I don't really want to play this anymore.
[78:11.27]So I switched games, and I was like, I don't know.
[78:14.21]I'll play Overwatch.
[78:15.99]And then you were on the enemy team again, and I was like, oh, God, no.
[78:18.48]He's going to think I'm stream sniping him, and I opened up your stream, and you're like, what the fuck?
[78:22.54]Ster.
[78:22.94]There's no way.
[78:24.04]He's following me.
[78:27.34]And I was really embarrassed and I was like, no, no, I didn't mean that.
[78:31.40]I didn't do this on purpose.
[78:35.00]No, I like that.
[78:37.46]That was the dream.
[78:38.38]That's a funny dream.
[78:39.44]I like that one.
[78:41.06]You didn't run from a chainsaw or anything.
[78:43.24]Those are always the best.
[78:44.26]When a dream is not, oh yeah, I'm running from a chainsaw today.
[78:47.58]Don't you just love when you get a dream that's just fucking regular dumb shit?
[78:50.37]Like, oh, I went in the fridge and drank ketchup.
[78:52.43]Oops.
[78:53.61]It's like, oh, I'm not getting chased by a chainsaw.
[78:55.87]That's fucking amazing.
[78:57.39]That's not a common one for me.
[79:00.97]Mine's like getting chased at school.
[79:06.44]I don't know how I'm a schoolgiver.
[79:08.44]I still, at the age of 39, still have dream... school dreams.
[79:12.92]Really?
[79:13.38]Okay, cool.
[79:13.78]Yeah, once in a while, I have a dream I'm missing class, or I didn't study, or the exam, all that.
[79:18.57]It's funny, because that stopped for me, I want to say, like, four or five years ago?
[79:22.41]That stopped a little, but it was going for a long time, honestly.
[79:29.77]Yeah, those are called nightmares.
[79:32.69]I've dreamed, like, four times, probably.
[79:35.54]Do you sleep, Poke?
[79:37.52]Yeah, I try.
[79:38.08]Do you get good sleep, or are you up a lot?
[79:41.78]I think it's terrible.
[79:44.56]Oh.
[79:46.98]That sucks.
[79:48.40]I think I have sleep apnea, but it's too easy to go check.
[79:52.11]Yeah.
[79:55.51]Yeah.
[79:56.98]Well, if you get some good sleep, you'll have the energy to go figure it out.
[80:00.48]Yeah.
[80:01.54]Dude, I remember I wanted to do a sleep test before too.
[80:05.57]Because I was like, what's wrong?
[80:08.03]I feel like I wake up and I feel like shit sometimes.
[80:11.90]is it is it like it kind of freaks me out though someone just kind of like oh yeah come on in for the sleep study yeah we're just gonna you know someone's gonna sit there and just watch you sleep the whole night they got a camera pointing right in your fucking head what if I don't fall asleep yeah I feel like I can't get what if you can't fake it right then no I can't perform for them
[80:34.82]You can't fake sleeping, right?
[80:36.44]It's like, oh shit, I'm gonna just close my eyes and this dude is like trying to watch my brainwaves and he's gonna be like, this dude's full of shit.
[80:44.26]You're just so embarrassed you just fake sleep for like eight hours.
[80:47.55]Yeah, and they come and ask you, and you're like, oh yeah, I was asleep.
[80:52.05]You had no REM sleep.
[80:53.03]You looked like you were having a great sleep.
[80:54.75]Hey, uh, yeah, we just wanted to make sure to let you know that for the results, you actually didn't even go into even, like, a daydream.
[81:05.15]Were you sleeping?
[81:06.13]You were asleep that whole time?
[81:06.98]Were you thinking?
[81:08.49]Because if you were asleep that whole time, there is some unbelievable medical problems with you that we need to discuss right now.
[81:13.89]We have a prescription to go on.
[81:14.91]We need to study you, too.
[81:16.18]At that point, did you just crack and go, I lied, I'm sorry, I didn't sleep at all?
[81:22.72]No.
[81:23.26]I'd be like, Michael Scott looks at the camera, and he laughs.
[81:26.74]Okay, but what if you wake up in the middle of, you know, you know when you wake up in a hotel room, and you're like, what fucking planet am I on?
[81:32.71]Oh, right, this is not my room.
[81:37.18]I don't wake up in hotels.
[81:38.92]You do that?
[81:39.90]Yeah, I wake sometimes I wake up.
[81:41.05]It's like three o'clock in the morning.
[81:42.29]It's like, this sucks.
[81:43.49]Where am I?
[81:46.91]I've gotten pretty decent at sleeping in hotels, but I'll tell you what I had.
[81:51.25]There was one time I went to Philly to do some kind of signing for charity.
[81:57.12]for like a little convention.
[81:59.94]And the hotel was very comfortable.
[82:02.28]The room was very comfortable.
[82:03.68]I slept a total of one hour and 15 minutes.
[82:06.85]And I tried for nine hours to sleep.
[82:09.55]And I woke up and signed the next day, and I was just dead.
[82:12.71]It was horrendous.
[82:14.55]And it was all mind games.
[82:15.85]I was playing with myself.
[82:18.42]And then I got mad at myself for not being able to sleep, and then I couldn't sleep.
[82:22.49]Like were you watching the TV or were you just like laying there like... I tried everything.
[82:26.19]I watched TV, I changed angles, I changed like from one side of the bed.
[82:30.13]It was just horrendous, yeah.
[82:36.68]Did you really try everything though?
[82:38.50]Maybe not.
[82:39.12]I didn't have melatonin.
[82:42.78]What are you thinking?
[82:43.56]Oh, I think I know what you're thinking.
[82:44.70]I'm thinking, thinking.
[82:45.45]Is that what you're thinking?
[82:47.25]Yeah.
[82:47.57]Alright.
[82:49.53]You put your face down on the pillow and hold your breath.
[82:54.37]Wait, but that's, that, what?
[82:55.59]Does that work?
[82:57.01]What the fuck?
[83:03.11]Never, I mean, like, no, no.
[83:05.69]I've never done that.
[83:06.77]You never did that, no.
[83:11.53]Is it me, or, like, stuff like passing out on purpose was, like, the thing to do when you're younger?
[83:18.15]am I crazy like you put a belt around your neck no like dude no no like no like what are you talking about do you remember like standing with your friend and be like no no no wait viddy's worried about family friendly streams right now I'm wondering what you guys are talking about is what I'm doing I'm not even saying anything
[83:37.92]With your French- Oh, wait, wait, hold up, hold up.
[83:39.60]This is the dialog.
[83:40.82]The mothership is dropping off something.
[83:42.34]We can talk about self-affixiation in a second.
[83:44.89]I didn't.
[83:45.23]That's not what I was implying.
[83:46.47]I was asking.
[83:46.99]You guys!
[83:47.47]These are fucking robots!
[83:50.41]What the hell is this?
[83:52.17]Why is there, like, a different video game character fighting us?
[83:54.60]Humanoid robots!
[83:58.23]No, but I was saying, like... I don't know how to, like... Like, suffocate, but not, like, weird.
[84:05.27]I don't know what that means, poke is the problem, and it's confusing me.
[84:08.32]You've never, like, suffocated with your friends, but not, like, in a weird way?
[84:11.90]Dog, I've never suffocated with my friends.
[84:14.04]Dude, I'm just playing it.
[84:16.66]Dude, I'm just talking about... I'm just talking about waking up in a hotel I don't know.
[84:21.40]No, hold on.
[84:23.58]No, it's like...
[84:26.76]No, there's like a weird thing where it's like you, like, stand weird.
[84:31.28]I don't know.
[84:33.00]Like a challenge.
[84:34.24]And you, like, pass out.
[84:36.50]What the fuck?
[84:37.30]No, I don't know about the suffocation challenge.
[84:39.56]Against the wall, yeah.
[84:40.60]No, you go against the wall or something.
[84:44.44]No, you go against the wall and you can, like, lose all breath or something.
[84:48.38]Oh, is it one of those, like, dangerous challenges things where it's like, oh, yeah, you do.
[84:53.00]Oh, yeah, you got to be careful with that shit.
[84:55.54]Oh yeah, you stand against the wall and someone pushes your chest and shit.
[84:59.50]Why did I do that?
[85:00.44]That was stupid of me.
[85:02.40]That was normal when I was younger.
[85:03.75]People were doing weird shit like that.
[85:05.09]Yeah, that's fucking crazy.
[85:06.67]That's fucked up.
[85:07.91]People have Roblox now.
[85:10.25]Yeah, I know.
[85:13.05]Sorry, Vinny.
[85:13.75]Did you see the dude that... Sorry, Vinny.
[85:16.88]Did you see the dude that stayed awake for a long time to get recently?
[85:23.90]Did you see that?
[85:25.63]Think it's real?
[85:26.99]I don't know if it's real, but I'll tell you what, I've read some stuff about how incredibly damaging that is to your psyche.
[85:34.76]I'm like, dude.
[85:35.82]You know what, here's what I'll say.
[85:38.22]That's not good.
[85:38.86]Let's just make a book club.
[85:40.22]They have a face.
[85:41.08]What?
[85:41.20]Look at their face.
[85:49.00]Oh god, there's norses.
[85:50.40]These are my aliens.
[85:51.22]I have these.
[85:51.62]They have bodies, bro.
[85:52.24]They're just aliens.
[85:52.96]They're just wearing armor.
[85:53.78]Wait, what does that have to do with a book club?
[85:55.42]What are you talking about?
[85:56.18]Yeah, what do you mean book club?
[85:57.12]Explain.
[85:57.46]We should just make a book club where we just, like, read a chapter of a book.
[86:00.37]We're not doing anything crazy.
[86:01.91]You know what I mean?
[86:02.39]Just read, like, some fucking nice book.
[86:04.45]And they talk about it, like, you know.
[86:07.17]What about e-books?
[86:07.81]Right, and not, like, choking each other.
[86:10.27]Okay, got it.
[86:11.07]If we're cycling people picking the game, your pick is a book.
[86:14.61]Okay, the next... If I get to pick, we are reading...
[86:18.56]the first chapter of a book, and we're all going to come and talk about it.
[86:24.37]Sure, I can do that.
[86:25.19]I was an English major at Jerma.
[86:26.69]I could try.
[86:26.99]I read a book once.
[86:27.51]Hated it.
[86:27.89]I think I read at least two or three books my whole life.
[86:29.69]Maybe two.
[86:44.54]Yeah, were they that bad you swore off books well one was the Anne Frank one and
[86:53.54]Okay.
[86:54.10]Actually, I think that's the only book.
[86:59.02]Dude, I... Dude, I remember reading... Yeah.
[87:03.32]I think it was, like, I don't know, Call of the Wild or something, and I, like, you know, they call on people, like, to talk about, like, hey, what'd you think about stuff?
[87:09.54]And I didn't read it at all.
[87:11.34]And you probably could hear the fucking cartoon gulp when I got called on.
[87:15.16]Like, it was silent.
[87:16.58]I hated that so much.
[87:19.44]I have a story of golden...

[88:16.28]And I chose a book called The Pig Man and Me.
[88:19.61]And it sounded cool because I thought there was like a man pig who was like cool, like funny, like, like porky, like cartoon porky pig.
[88:27.99]And it turns out this was just this dude's name for his grandfather.
[88:30.61]And it was just like this flat, dry book about like a dude and his grandfather and like stuff that happened.
[88:41.47]and it was really bad, you know, for someone who was like seven, eight.
[88:45.69]But by then I was stuck with it and I just pretended to read it and then made up my own version of events.
[88:55.18]So, yeah.
[88:56.30]Wait, what kind of stuff happened?
[88:58.98]In my story or in the actual story?
[89:01.30]Yeah.
[89:01.66]He was like, my grandfather took me to the harbor and like we shucked clams and, you know, I don't know.
[89:08.55]I couldn't pay attention, Poke.
[89:10.09]It was so, so bad for like an eight-year-old.
[89:13.37]So what was your version?
[89:15.61]It was about a pig man.
[89:18.54]Oh, yeah.
[89:19.14]Did this pig man have superpowers, or was it just kind of like a pig man?
[89:22.00]I don't fully remember.
[89:23.00]I don't remember, but I remember just making up my own version of events, and I even, like... Like, listen, the pig man in my book was also a grandfather, but he was also a pig half-man, half-pig.
[89:33.36]So, it was cool.
[89:34.36]I liked it a lot, my version.
[89:36.09]I might write that one day.
[89:37.03]Maybe I'll write my own.
[89:38.57]Oh, can I tell you guys a weird story?
[89:40.63]Yeah.
[89:41.97]Dude, I was in Lebanon when I was younger for the summer.
[89:46.74]And, uh, I had a Nintendo DS, right?
[89:51.11]And, uh, I went to the store and they had, like, a rent, like... The only games I could find was, like, one game that was, like, 100 ROMs in one.
[90:00.18]Oh, no.
[90:00.66]Like, 100 games in one, right?
[90:02.36]Yeah, I know those.
[90:03.08]And then this other one, they had a... Dude, I got a hacked Zelda ROM.
[90:09.74]Where everything was altered.
[90:11.11]And it was like called Link Gets Laid.
[90:13.89]And it was uh... No, no, no.
[90:17.79]I found the video.
[90:19.71]And it's just like altered text.
[90:22.10]He has a dick instead of a sword.
[90:23.44]What the fuck?
[90:26.61]no and it's just the worst thing you could put in a game it has racism like everything terrible and I was a kid I had no idea I'm like what the hell is this oh my god it's extremely racist like I don't know how the hell I had that it's real too I just looked it up oh no yeah no no how did somebody get that and put it in lebanon like
[90:53.80]So when you were younger, you just, like, thought this is what The Legend of Zelda was.
[90:59.23]No, I knew what Zelda was, but I knew something was wrong.
[91:01.35]Like, why does he have a dick?
[91:02.39]Yeah, because it's like, what the fuck is going on?
[91:04.53]Like, yeah, like, what would you even think?
[91:06.99]Yeah, no, because I looked it up recently.
[91:08.41]I'm like, yeah, I remember this.
[91:09.47]And I found out it's real.
[91:11.69]And then I looked at the video, and it's just the worst words ever.
[91:15.39]Yeah.
[91:15.73]So thank God I didn't understand.
[91:17.05]Like, holy shit.
[91:18.56]But that's a weirdly common thing, Poke, where they, like, load these systems with ROM hacks.
[91:25.08]And it's just a way to, like... Yeah, and then they pass them out to children.
[91:29.30]Yeah, seems like it.
[91:30.98]Yeah, but how did they... It's so strange how we got there.
[91:32.98]Wait, these are green ants.
[91:35.50]Green monsters, please call them by their lore-friendly name.
[91:39.10]Oh, they are fast.
[91:40.24]Oh my goodness.
[91:44.29]Do you see what this gun can do?
[91:45.79]Holy shit.
[91:46.13]Don't look it up.
[91:46.81]If you're looking it up, just do not.
[91:48.47]It's bad.
[91:49.09]It's really bad, Chad.
[91:49.73]It's really bad.
[91:50.57]Really bad.
[91:52.25]I can't believe how fast they are.
[91:54.83]They are very fast.
[91:59.29]It's a virus.
[92:02.41]It'll mess up your whole N64.
[92:03.53]Did you guys ever get any weird viruses on a computer?
[92:10.88]Trust me, I'm a dolphin.
[92:11.98]That virus.
[92:13.69]I don't think I ever got like a virus virus.
[92:21.39]In like LimeWire days, I feel like I had to reformat my computer like four times a year.
[92:27.61]Oh yeah, reformatting.
[92:29.49]I thought that was just like the normal thing computers had to do.
[92:32.73]You just thought you got viruses all the time.
[92:36.18]Yeah, it's reformat time.
[92:37.82]I swear like one year it was like seven times.
[92:43.80]To be fair, it was really easy to accidentally download a virus in those days.
[92:48.24]And antivirus wasn't as sophisticated as it is now.
[92:50.80]So you would have like the Pamela Anderson like virus.
[92:54.61]Where it was just like, she'd just be like naked, and then your computer dies.
[92:58.43]Like, I remember that one, I remember the one that was like... Computers were not that, uh, technologically advanced either.
[93:06.07]So like a, like a malware that would like, you know, like you said, like a Pamela Anderson picture, you had like 400 kilobytes of like available space on your fucking computer.
[93:15.84]So it was just like, oh, well, let's just destroy it because it's going to overload your hard drive and then it's going to do all kinds of other fucked up shit because your computer has like 1.2 gigs of RAM in it.
[93:27.57]Yeah.
[93:28.71]Running on Windows, what, like Windows 98?
[93:30.37]98 was mine, yeah.
[93:31.79]How many flaws were in that fucking thing?
[93:34.60]Who knows?
[93:35.56]I had Windows Me.
[93:36.02]I had Windows Me.
[93:39.52]Yeah, I had ME as well.
[93:40.62]That one's not great.
[93:41.40]That was a bad one.
[93:42.94]Agreed upon to be one of the worst ones.
[93:45.35]Yep.
[93:48.17]I've died.
[93:48.61]I just wanted to play video games, you know?
[93:55.17]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[93:57.15]Are we annoying you, sir?
[93:59.10]What?
[93:59.36]No, no, I mean back in the day.
[94:00.74]That's where I was getting viruses.
[94:01.66]I always wanted to play, like, hacked games.
[94:03.66]I think I got, like, three separate viruses trying to play Soldier of Fortune 2.
[94:09.11]not worth it shit I think I found like The Witcher in like a dumpster yeah wait is that back here is that the original witcher like The Witcher that had like four minute long loading springs no I think it was witcher three I'm gonna play this attack those monsters
[94:34.37]I loved the... I think it was The Witcher 2, maybe.
[94:37.09]I guess I'm calling in the co-op tank.
[94:39.04]Oh my goodness, that's a lot.
[94:41.08]Oh, this is bad.
[94:41.90]I'm having... On me for co-op.
[94:45.52]I hit a point when I played The Witcher 2.
[94:48.70]I'm alive.
[94:49.22]I'm good.
[94:49.70]They're both dead.
[94:50.76]I wanted to do co-op tank and they died.
[94:52.42]I'm coming.
[94:53.10]We'll co-op tank over there.
[94:55.94]I got thrown away now.
[94:57.20]This is ruining my day.
[94:58.88]We're fine.
[95:00.03]We're fine.
[95:00.31]We're fine.
[95:01.61]They are leaving no traces back.
[95:03.45]Whoa, my game crashed.
[95:04.84]Really?
[95:05.54]Sorry, the co-op tank crashed you?
[95:07.72]Yep.
[95:08.12]That fucked up.
[95:09.38]Yep, game just crashed.
[95:11.14]I'm coming in there.
[95:14.42]Can I join mid-game?
[95:15.34]Is that possible?
[95:16.68]I don't think so.
[95:18.64]I just killed the tank's gun.
[95:21.14]Yeah.
[95:23.69]Sorry.
[95:25.09]I think this is the last wave if we're...
[95:28.90]Able to survive.
[95:29.80]Nope.
[95:30.66]I think the worst thing on the internet is streamers.
[95:39.53]Yeah.
[95:40.11]Did you say streamers?
[95:41.75]Yeah, I hate those.
[95:48.05]Yeah, what's the next thing?
[95:49.99]What's the next big thing?
[95:50.85]We had, you know, YouTube was a big, big thing.
[95:54.71]It was like VODs, and it was live.
[95:57.85]What's the next thing?
[96:02.40]Um, mascot horror.
[96:04.64]Oh, wait, that's already happening.
[96:07.66]Mascot?
[96:08.58]Oh, you mean like a video game?
[96:11.32]What if there is no next thing?
[96:13.26]What if it's just nuclear war and we reset?
[96:17.28]You know, I gotta be honest with you.
[96:19.20]Yeah.
[96:20.06]If we just kind of stayed here for a little while, I'm alright with that.
[96:25.38]Oh, you weren't being honest with me.
[96:26.85]You were looking forward to nuclear war.
[96:28.91]No, no, I said things, like, I'm taking, like, delete that part.
[96:31.43]I'm talking, like, if things just, like, stayed technologically where they were, we don't need 6G.
[96:37.35]We don't need 6G.
[96:38.13]I don't need it.
[96:38.57]Who needs it?
[96:39.05]You don't need it.
[96:39.41]I don't need it.
[96:40.88]You're saying we're done?
[96:42.32]Let's just stay right here.
[96:42.94]You think, like, we hit a limit?
[96:44.34]Like, just stay where it is?
[96:45.38]I just think we keep it right here for, like, ten years.
[96:47.70]And just, like, let it, you know, let's just see what happens.
[96:50.66]Too much technology.
[96:52.08]We need to go back to fucking putting hay into, uh, into real barrels and stuff.
[96:56.45]I really believe it.
[96:58.08]Yeah, I was gonna say, I'm like, I'm entertained by ducks.
[97:01.62]Like, I just feed a duck and I'm happy.
[97:03.24]So I, like, I have a Steam Deck, you know, and it's like, that's cool.
[97:08.03]But, like, you give me, like, an acoustic guitar and, like, a piece of straw.
[97:11.91]Like, I could, like, play guitar and be, like, a pappy while I feed a duck.
[97:17.21]That's, like, my golden zone.
[97:19.52]You know?
[97:20.36]I got a whole bunch of ducks nearby.
[97:22.12]Whole bunch of ducks.
[97:26.62]I ain't even lying.
[97:27.86]what now at the park or do you like like where are they they're they're out in a park there's a there's a big old ducky park we're gonna start banging sticks and rocks together somebody said we'll stagnate if we don't you guys want to start a streamer barn there aren't any monsters here sir don't you live near me something's off wait did you guys mission for me I thought you lived near me but then I thought you went back to canadia no wait
[97:56.38]Wait, am I?
[97:59.06]Where am I right now?
[98:00.74]I just woke up in a hotel room.

[98:13.63]Yeah, everybody mute.
[98:16.16]Mute up.
[98:19.36]Oh, mute up.
[98:20.80]Wait, did you guys actually quit the mission on my behalf?
[98:25.58]Oh, no, we failed.
[98:27.12]Oh, you did.
[98:27.60]I want to get you in this tank.
[98:34.26]They're eating the building.
[98:35.68]This isn't good.
[98:37.24]They keep coming.
[98:40.36]Can I say, I like this group.
[98:42.16]I think you guys are funny.
[98:45.13]Thanks, Jerma.
[98:46.13]Thank you.
[98:52.17]What's the game for next time?
[98:54.27]That's your call, my man.
[98:56.17]Sorry, I guess it's your call, and I just called Pilgrim in front of you.
[98:58.99]Let's do Pilgrim.
[99:01.47]I'll do it.
[99:02.25]Pilgrim's a Lethal Company, but it looks like Bloodborne.
[99:05.45]Sure, yeah, I'm down for that.
[99:08.05]I mean, I was going to say, let's do a $25,000 poker between the four of us.
[99:11.51]I thought you were supposed to name a book to read.
[99:16.21]Yeah, I thought I heard something else.
[99:17.73]I don't know.
[99:21.00]I'll play poker I you know I like games that are like kind of more one-offs like because getting a group together to do a co-op game consistently can be tough and and it stresses me out but like just playing random like this and like worms and you know whatever like this game you can just pick up and play right like you don't need to like
[99:42.50]I don't need to be here every time you guys play it.
[99:43.84]I feel like at this point we're barely even in the game.
[99:46.74]We're just fucking around.
[99:48.16]EDF is a great game just to, you know, talk about everything we've talked about so far.
[99:56.37]Like raw hot dogs, yeah.
[99:58.09]Raw hot dogs.
[100:00.45]Viruses.
[100:01.33]Roms.
[100:04.37]Insta-death.
[100:05.33]Dreams.
[100:05.97]Put some respect on EDF's name.
[100:08.38]I am telling you right now that that is a great, great accolade.
[100:14.06]Yeah, EDF is awesome, but you can zone.
[100:16.20]You can easily just kind of, like, chill.
[100:17.86]Yeah.
[100:18.58]He's mad that we're not, like... Am I here?
[100:22.29]Am I here, guys?
[100:24.45]We're not E3-ing it.
[100:26.79]Jerry, I have a grenade here with health if you want.

[102:29.01]Mint.
[102:29.21]It could be anything.
[102:29.81]It could be a lot of different things.
[102:31.77]Sour apple.
[102:32.63]Sour apple, yeah.
[102:36.73]The loudest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.
[102:39.65]Jesus.
[102:40.03]I could see that noise.
[102:45.16]This is not going well anymore.
[102:46.95]No, I'm died.
[102:47.63]Come on, man.
[102:49.11]Why are you dropping this on top of me?
[102:51.42]Just shut up.
[102:51.88]Wait, why are you going to bring it up?
[102:53.62]Real voice.
[102:53.98]Real voice.
[102:54.46]It was cool until you brought it up.
[103:16.94]I'm the ultimate soldier.
[103:18.92]If you could manifest a blow pop in front of you right now.
[103:22.92]Boys, what are you manifesting?
[103:25.78]I had one today, Jerma.
[103:26.82]I'm not even kidding.
[103:27.80]Another enemy unit is moving towards your area.
[103:33.23]Is it the ones with the gun inside?
[103:35.29]Uh-huh.
[103:36.89]I went to a diner a week and a half ago and they gave me grape.
[103:41.69]The one I had was grape.
[103:42.55]It was good.
[103:42.93]Good stuff.
[103:44.37]There's something like you didn't even said anything.
[103:47.23]Just the phrase I went to a diner evokes emotion in me.
[103:51.19]I was like, man, you must have like a great time.
[103:54.25]Diners are amazing.
[103:55.65]I literally just thought on the East Coast again, we got to hang.
[103:59.36]Especially like a New York diner.
[104:02.28]I asked for a cheesesteak in New York once and they looked real confused and they came back and they gave me a cut of steak with like cheese melted on top.
[104:10.89]Yeah, that's not that's not as good.
[104:13.95]It's weird because New York does have good cheesesteaks if you know where to look.
[104:18.17]I didn't even know what that was.
[104:21.23]Yeah, that's not cool.
[104:23.44]I'm disappointed in them.
[104:25.02]Me too.
[104:25.74]I think about that often.
[104:27.44]It's like it haunts your dreams.
[104:30.92]Like I have school dreams, you have cheesesteak dreams.
[104:33.86]No, it's a waking nightmare.
[104:37.64]Sorry, man.
[104:38.28]I didn't mean to laugh about it.
[104:40.26]okay we're doing um I think I like the loadout I had honestly the ancient layer of doom we're doing the ancient layer of doom Jerma hasn't seen these monsters I've seen these monsters this is a new scary type of monster they look just like people the diner tuna melts it's on the menu it is a best in slot I'm ordering it every time
[105:06.80]I don't fuck with tuna.
[105:08.00]So that's your diner order, Charm?
[105:10.92]Okay.
[105:11.64]It's either a tuna melt with just one pickle spear.
[105:19.44]And if it's done right, that's best in slot.
[105:22.11]I pick it every time.
[105:22.83]Either that or... Do you ever have patty melt?
[105:26.75]Patty melt is awesome, yeah.
[105:28.35]That's another... If it's there, if it's on a diner menu, I'm just going to get it.
[105:35.05]What about like eggs benny?
[105:38.60]Not a big... I'm more of a two eggs over medium, you know, bagel and some hash browns.
[105:45.50]I'm a very kind of basic.
[105:46.70]I do love corned beef hash, though.
[105:48.16]Corned beef hash is great.
[105:50.72]Yeah, that's really good.
[105:51.72]If it's a breakfast menu, it's corned beef hash and eggs.
[105:53.76]If it's a lunch menu, it's tuna melt or patty melt.
[105:55.90]I'm going to get corned beef hash tomorrow.
[105:59.36]I'm the waiter and I'm trying to write all that down.
[106:01.14]Like, what time is it?
[106:02.04]What does he want?
[106:03.96]That's why diners are great because they have breakfast all day.
[106:07.23]yeah but he's giving me like a time frame I gotta check the clock which one did he want a b or c it's over depends either one I can't see any of you if it's morning and maybe I'll order the breakfast this is the end yeah
[106:28.67]What's going on?
[106:31.51]We're having a cutscene.
[106:32.63]What do you mean we're having a cutscene?
[106:36.32]We're in a cutscene.
[106:38.28]This is the story.
[106:39.10]Yeah.
[106:39.76]Yeah.
[106:40.14]Yeah.
[106:45.65]This human's got two arms and two legs.
[106:48.33]We can't even compete.
[106:49.69]We have defeated them before.
[106:52.37]There's a way to fight them.
[106:54.03]We are soldiers, brave and strong.
[106:57.70]Greetings.
[106:58.38]We can move now.
[106:59.68]Oh, we can move.
[107:00.42]From any harm.
[107:01.66]And will eventually be depleted.
[107:03.66]A depleted shield turns black.
[107:05.64]Oh, there is aliens.
[107:07.16]Oh, these things are freaky.
[107:09.02]Whoa.
[107:10.01]I can't afford to die here.
[107:12.95]They're just like people.
[107:16.72]Dude, the developers made this.
[107:19.82]They definitely were walking around.
[107:21.64]They were saying, like, people are going to get here.
[107:24.14]And they're just going to go, man, this is so fucked up.
[107:28.47]It instantly killed me.
[107:29.39]That's what they wanted the people to do.
[107:30.83]Like, people to say when they got here.
[107:32.53]I suck.
[107:34.45]I'll try to get you, Poke, when I can.
[107:35.65]Man, I'm a suck noob.
[107:46.74]they have yeah they have shields they like blocking yeah oh my goodness these they hurt a lot they sure do I'm guys lagging I'm very nice I was told on this mission they all aggro and multiplayer they don't normally all fight you at once
[108:14.81]I don't know about impossible, but it's going to be very hard.
[108:21.25]That was crazy.
[108:23.05]That was very quick.
[108:27.63]We've only got two arms and two legs.
[108:31.55]How are we supposed to beat them?
[108:34.63]Okay, not that mission.
[108:35.99]We are dead.
[108:37.65]I still like the loadout.
[108:46.36]Yeah, I feel like my... My healing grenades are an asset to the team, so I'm just gonna... They are so good.
[108:54.50]I was gonna put them on, but I feel like you've got it covered pretty well.
[108:57.75]Yeah, I'll bring... I got better ones now.
[108:59.71]I'll just bring them.
[109:00.49]Also, that bike.
[109:01.19]I don't know why I even brought the bike.
[109:02.35]That thing sucks.
[109:08.39]Double sniper.
[109:14.21]Ooh, this is a very...
[109:16.43]This is a very nice thing for my backpack.
[109:19.89]Cool.
[109:20.33]Is this live?
[109:21.41]Well, I can tell you smelly sandwiches.
[109:23.79]1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.
[109:24.75]This is in fact a live stream.
[109:26.99]We are live.
[109:28.52]And then other people are going to think that you planted that chat member with that specific name.
[109:32.86]Would have been a great idea.
[109:33.68]I'm not live.
[109:36.02]The aliens have occupied this town.
[109:37.72]This is a pre-recording.
[109:40.75]They haven't noticed our approach.
[109:42.89]Infiltrate the town.
[109:44.07]How do I watch it, Star?
[109:44.93]One by one.
[109:47.11]Tell me where to find your content.
[109:48.31]No.
[109:48.49]Alright.
[109:52.34]My stream is like a speakeasy, I've been told.
[109:54.44]You need to know the password.
[109:57.64]Annihilate these alien gorillas.
[110:01.18]Alien gorilla?
[110:04.26]He just called it a gorilla.
[110:06.36]Did he?
[110:07.68]Yeah, he called it a fucking gorilla.
[110:10.35]I don't think that guy should be in a leadership position.
[110:18.46]One more diner meal I forgot I wanted to mention is the hot open roast beef sandwich.
[110:23.56]Does that appeal to you at all?
[110:28.62]It can, very specifically.
[110:31.72]And I'm going to be, maybe I might be gross.
[110:34.57]I don't know.
[110:35.53]Oh, you might, you guys might completely agree with this.
[110:40.47]A roast beef sandwich, like a hot roast beef sandwich.
[110:42.85]It's got to have mayo on it or I don't really want it.
[110:46.65]Yeah, I don't agree with that.
[110:47.97]What about mustard?
[110:54.38]Mustard is good.
[110:56.80]Yeah, I could put mustard on it.
[111:04.33]I'm getting them.
[111:04.77]Do you like mustard on burger?
[111:09.55]I'm an occasional Mustarder.
[111:11.51]If it's been a while, then I can really go for some mustard.
[111:14.69]Dude, mustard's good on sandwiches, man.
[111:16.67]Mustard's awesome.
[111:17.85]It's so good.
[111:19.04]And it's great on a burger.
[111:20.52]guys like hot mustard they did nothing yeah like like the Chinese food mustard yep the stuff that you yeah that's amazing you clear out your sinuses it feels like you get electrocuted from a half a second where you go like wait what yeah more aliens if you don't know the feeling yeah hot mustard electrocution is it's a thing let's Google it look it up research third electrocution you want me to look up
[111:46.75]I didn't tell you.
[111:47.31]No, don't look it up.
[111:48.41]I don't know what the fuck you're going to get.
[111:50.61]Just pause the game real quick.
[111:56.00]Hot mustard.
[111:57.80]It has a... You know horseradish?
[112:02.42]Yeah.
[112:04.04]It's like a wasabi kind of like horseradish.
[112:07.22]That nasal heap.
[112:09.79]I love nasal heap.
[112:12.66]But sometimes you do a little too much and you actually do get kind of like, your brain gets like electrocuted.
[112:16.94]You go like, and you freeze up and you kind of go like, and your whole body locks up for like half, like at least like two or three seconds.
[112:26.45]Yeah, I like that hot mustard.
[112:30.77]I combine it with the duck sauce for the noodles, the hard noodles they give you.
[112:36.99]And I dip the noodles in the mustard first, then the duck sauce, and it's perfect.
[112:42.63]That's so good.
[112:43.59]What's duck sauce?
[112:46.14]For, like, ribs.
[112:47.51]It's like an orange sauce that they give you at, like, Chinese food restaurants.
[112:50.95]Yeah, but is it duck?
[112:51.43]Not made of duck.
[112:52.53]No, there's no duck materials in there.
[112:54.29]I don't think I've ever had duck.
[112:59.63]I've had it very, like, maybe twice in my life.
[113:02.34]It's pretty greasy.
[113:03.90]Yeah, I'm not... I don't... I don't like that stuff.
[113:08.04]It's, like, kind of like... I like duck.
[113:11.56]You're talking about duck?
[113:13.92]You like duck?
[113:14.34]Duck, duck, goose?
[113:15.58]Yeah.
[113:19.57]it's it's hit or miss it's hard to make it in a way I feel like a lot of places that serve duck do it greasy but you know and also I like ducks a lot so it's kind of like sacrilege for me to I I I get you on that but my tongue's already pretty greasy so I don't even notice oh what what's happening dude you like one of those game of thrones characters that drinks like the blue goofy liquid
[113:49.02]Well, no, more like the Mad Max.
[113:50.64]I'm doing a lot of silver paint cans in my mouth.
[113:59.38]Shit.
[113:59.64]I'm going to try to save you guys, but I'm having a bit of a hard time here.
[114:03.80]Yeah, I contributed to this mission.
[114:07.54]I just died to it.
[114:09.40]I'm going to try.
[114:09.78]I'm going to try.
[114:15.73]Oh my God, he froze at the last second.
[114:17.85]Bastard.
[114:18.94]Yeah, I don't know.
[114:19.60]Ever since somebody sprayed sunscreen in my mouth, it's just been kind of greasy and a little slimy.
[114:26.09]There's lore here I'm missing, isn't there?
[114:27.81]Yeah, there is.
[114:28.37]And there's a couple of very important pieces of information you don't have.
[114:31.85]Before that stream, I asked, like, I think nine or ten times, are you sure you want me to do this?
[114:37.67]I don't want to do that.
[114:39.30]No, no, no.
[114:39.88]I'm good.
[114:40.20]I'm good.
[114:40.56]Do it.
[114:43.22]What do you mean?
[114:43.70]Are you saying the whole thing was staged?
[114:48.16]No.
[114:49.96]You're up.
[114:50.86]Run.
[114:52.18]Oh, God, this acceleration.
[114:53.48]This is not a great way to do this.
[114:54.99]I'm dead.
[114:55.27]I'm dead.
[114:56.01]Again?
[114:56.83]Yeah.
[114:57.85]Fuck.
[114:58.35]Alright.
[114:58.59]You almost helped me.
[115:04.55]What is going on over here?
[115:06.91]I just hear, like, very loud moaning.
[115:09.35]What the fuck is going on?
[115:10.61]You're something else.
[115:12.29]This duck talk got me hungry.
[115:13.59]Good Jerma when he knocks on my door.
[115:23.63]Huh?
[115:25.03]Hmm?
[115:27.11]Get me up!
[115:28.27]Try can't Ster.
[115:29.05]I'm trying.
[115:29.77]There's too many of them.
[115:30.53]I have to take out a couple first.
[115:32.27]A couple bugs over here.
[115:34.15]Remember when you were going to drink Ster's spit.
[115:37.12]Yeah, I do.
[115:38.46]That's normal.
[115:41.34]yeah I I wanted to okay so we had this little thing where he we we like hate each other and he was like in my my room and I was gonna get up like oh what are you doing here we're finally gonna like look we're friends um and then I I got out of the I was gonna get out of the chair and I wanted to commit to the bit so bad to make it be like holy
[116:01.81]Like, you know, when a dev makes a game and you get to a part where it's like things are kind of like fucked up and the whole point is to go, that's wicked fucked up, dude.
[116:10.96]That's what I was going for.
[116:11.78]I wanted you to spit a full loogie into like a Coke can and I was going to just sit down and be friends with you and just start chugging it.
[116:20.48]We also were going to do a thing where one of us was going to poison a cup and we were going to continue to trade it back and forth because we just weren't sure what cup was poisoned.
[116:31.42]There was a couple of things that kind of fell through the cracks there.
[116:33.89]I forgot about all of this.
[116:35.09]Yeah, don't like any of this.
[116:36.19]You're a bunch of psychopaths.
[116:41.65]But did this happen in real life?
[116:43.15]Well, it was a real poison.
[116:44.27]What are people talking about?
[116:46.67]Is there a video of this suntan thing?
[116:49.31]Yeah, well, the sunscreen, yeah, that happened.
[116:51.17]I need to see this.
[117:02.00]I don't quite know where you'd get specifically that clip.
[117:05.34]Yeah, I don't know.
[117:06.30]It was a long time ago.
[117:07.16]I'm going to Google it.
[117:11.59]I have a picture.
[117:13.07]Jerma sunscreen.
[117:18.49]Video popped up.
[117:27.49]Uh, no.
[117:28.47]I took it like a man.
[117:29.27]Maybe 17?
[117:29.45]Maybe 18?
[117:29.67]I don't even remember.
[117:30.39]It's a long time ago.
[117:31.01]I wouldn't mind doing it again.
[117:32.17]Eating sunscreen?
[117:33.11]That's cool, dog.
[117:33.57]Alright, they get up here pretty quickly.
[117:35.75]Focus fire.
[117:52.42]I was telling Jerma I want to break geodes.
[117:56.73]Yeah.
[117:56.97]Are you getting into geodes?
[117:59.07]I just like the idea of that one geode.
[118:04.21]Like a geode dude you want to be?
[118:06.53]I could be a geode dude.
[118:08.68]So what do you mean break geodes?
[118:11.20]I know Jerma did a bit, but what was that?
[118:14.90]Just breaking the rocks and getting a cool design.
[118:16.96]That'd be cool.
[118:18.06]Yeah.
[118:18.96]No one's ever seen before.
[118:19.86]You would like the Natural History Museum.
[118:22.04]I would love to do that again.
[118:23.60]You know, just like crack up, just get a bunch more of them and just break them again.
[118:27.39]Yeah.
[118:29.29]So, yeah.
[118:30.03]What if we got them from all around the world?
[118:34.73]You want to try to find some, you want to get some geodes from like a bunch of different countries and stuff and see what we get?
[118:41.15]We should spend like at least like 100k on this.
[118:45.20]Holy fuck.
[118:45.86]That's a lot.
[118:46.24]Let's get like a million dollars worth of geodes.
[118:49.96]Okay, well, if we spend a million dollars on geodes, what's the rare case that there'll be like a ten million dollar geode, right?
[118:57.10]What's the unboxing return here?
[118:59.89]It could be full of diamonds.
[119:00.91]We don't know.
[119:01.27]Pokémon cards all over again.
[119:02.59]Just Earth.
[119:07.83]I mean... What do you think?
[119:10.42]A couple of brews with the boys?
[119:11.84]Cracking geodes?
[119:12.66]What do you think?
[119:14.02]Swinging some golf clubs.
[119:15.62]Yeah, we could do some chipping.
[119:17.20]We could do some, like, putting.
[119:18.70]Eating some sunblock.
[119:19.92]Drinking like a beer.
[119:23.20]Drinking like a beer.
[119:25.11]Suffocating ourselves with boys, you know?
[119:26.95]I'm not old enough.
[119:30.31]Whatever the fuck that was.
[119:34.71]Don't drink the Geo juice!
[119:37.49]I came with the wrong gear.
[119:41.99]Yeah, what happens if you drink that water that was in there?
[119:45.22]There's got to be some ancient bacteria.
[119:48.92]Yeah, the rocks have like water in it.
[119:50.54]You probably get like a parasite.
[119:55.65]and not and not one of the cool ones too from like immortality bro after that you go to ancestry.com and you got dinosaur DNA you become encino man starring brendan fraser
[120:07.83]Hell yeah.
[120:08.73]Lots of stuff starts happening apparently.
[120:10.95]Okay, if there was a 30% chance that you would instantly die, but a 70% chance that when you drink the Geo Juice, you get a bunch of superpowers, would you do it?
[120:25.89]Yeah.
[120:26.13]30% chance you insta-die?
[120:26.85]30% chance.
[120:27.97]My rule?
[120:29.33]I have a rule for this.
[120:32.05]a pre-established percentage.
[120:34.00]If it's 30% chance something bad happens, I always take it.
[120:37.14]If it's above 30% chance, I never do it.
[120:39.38]Even if it's 31.
[120:41.10]If it's 31, I'm not doing it.
[120:42.35]Okay.
[120:44.03]Nope.
[120:45.43]I would do it if I was in a particularly bad mood that day.
[120:51.49]That's my answer.
[120:52.05]I think that's really the only answer I have.
[120:54.07]Give me that fucking thing.
[120:55.07]I don't even care.
[120:55.97]Like, whatever.
[120:56.63]It doesn't matter.
[120:57.23]You just had the emergency superpower geode or whatever.
[121:01.01]And you're like, nah, you know what?
[121:05.62]Yeah, I mean, if I'm in a good mood, I'll just keep living my life as is.
[121:09.52]And I'm fine with that.
[121:10.74]But then, like, if I'm in a bad mood, like, it's the worst I've got to lose.
[121:13.52]Could only, you know, who gives a shit?
[121:16.12]You might be able to fly in ten minutes.
[121:18.18]Well, you get a power that makes it worse.
[121:20.92]I could be a real Geodude myself.
[121:23.20]Okay, so there's a 50% chance that it will instantly kill you, and 50% to get whatever superpowers you want.
[121:29.41]No.
[121:29.95]But hold on.
[121:31.23]It takes ten years for it to roll the dice.
[121:35.43]Like, after you drink it.
[121:35.99]Oh, man.
[121:39.03]Mmm.
[121:40.81]This reminds me of that Coldplay song.
[121:42.23]No, because imagine in ten years that fucking Elon Musk makes all those powers.
[121:48.37]I don't know.
[121:49.97]It's like, could you use a different example?
[121:52.28]Yeah, it's like, oh shit, everyone has it.
[121:55.94]I'm at the risk for what?
[121:59.02]Yeah, but the power, you could choose the power to go back ten years.
[122:02.08]Yeah, but what if you have the power of time?
[122:05.92]I don't mess with time.
[122:11.20]Teleportation, please.
[122:12.32]That's a good answer.
[122:12.98]Jerry, Jerry, get over here.
[122:14.24]Jerry, get over here.
[122:14.82]I got healing.
[122:15.82]Come back to me.
[122:18.70]I'm coming over to the green mist you got going on over here.
[122:23.92]Yeah, come to the green mist.
[122:25.20]It's delicious.
[122:26.36]Yeah, come to the delicious spearmint mist.
[122:33.38]Yeah, I wouldn't do the 50% because you never know, 10 years could be awesome.
[122:37.10]You know, and then like you live in 10 years from now and then you're like, oh man.
[122:41.66]I don't know, life begins in 50, I've heard.
[122:43.94]I saw that on an advertisement.
[122:46.55]There is a 20% chance that when you drink this liquid, you turn into a baby.
[122:53.85]And do you, like, remember everything, or are you just baby goo-goo-ga-ga?
[122:56.91]A Jerma would do it just to be a baby.
[122:59.52]A Jerma, do you have all of these?
[123:02.68]Hold on, what's next on the shelf here?
[123:04.94]This one says it is a 40% chance for you to get very sick every day at 8 o'clock in the morning every single morning.
[123:12.94]Hmm.
[123:15.37]But there's a 30% chance to go to the best diner, gosh darn it, every day.
[123:18.93]Tell me about your potions, Gemma.
[123:19.79]I just summoned the Death Ray.
[123:32.70]I almost feel sorry for them.
[123:34.76]They couldn't call this town home either.
[123:38.30]Someone in my chat said they would get sick of the diner food every day.
[123:41.40]But that's the thing about diners.
[123:43.68]It's varied.
[123:45.29]The reason a diner has a menu of like fucking 300 items is because you can be a repeat customer every day.
[123:50.79]Nah, have you tried Uber Eats every day?
[123:55.17]No.
[123:55.35]Okay, I've got a potion for you.
[123:59.03]Okay, what's the potion?
[124:01.13]80% chance I get you pregnant.
[124:03.83]What is it with you guys?
[124:05.65]Hold on.
[124:06.20]Wait a minute.
[124:06.62]What's going on here?
[124:07.44]That one's from my chat.
[124:08.58]Time out.
[124:09.98]Shot clock went to zero.
[124:12.54]Okay.
[124:12.90]Yeah.
[124:13.74]I drink a geode off of your shelf.
[124:15.96]Is that what you're saying?
[124:17.96]A potion.
[124:19.00]I drink a potion.
[124:21.30]And it's an 80% chance that I'm going to become pregnant.
[124:27.24]Yes.
[124:28.10]Okay.
[124:29.68]No, I'll take a Pepsi, dude.
[124:31.76]I'll take a Coke if you have it.
[124:35.70]Okay.
[124:37.95]Yeah, but you could be like the first, though.
[124:41.43]What's the 20%?
[124:41.89]Okay, what's the other part?
[124:44.79]It doesn't happen.
[124:47.70]I am going to pour this drink down the sink.
[124:50.92]Why would I drink it?
[124:53.33]I wouldn't take it.
[124:54.03]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[124:54.77]So you come into my house, reach up onto my potion shelf, and just start pouring shit into the sink, and saying, like, you shouldn't have this.
[125:01.40]No, I'm saying if you hand me a potion without a label on it, and you say, drink it, and I'm gonna go, what the fuck are you talking about?
[125:07.68]And you're gonna go, wait, there's an 80% chance that, oh, you know, ah, you know, ah, you'll get, ah, pregnant.
[125:12.64]Oh, what's the other 20%?
[125:13.64]Nothing.
[125:14.80]I'm dumping that down the drain.
[125:15.92]Yeah, you need a positive.
[125:17.32]You need something, like, good to entice us.
[125:20.86]The 20%, it's twins.
[125:24.33]Oh, well, yeah, sure.
[125:25.07]Then I'm in.
[125:25.73]But do they get to be like Goku and Vegeta?
[125:32.91]They're not twins.
[125:34.09]I don't care.
[125:36.49]How's it come out?
[125:38.40]Do I get to have... Okay, do I get to have... If it's twins, do I get to have two like Goku and Vegeta level like superheroes?
[125:47.52]Yeah.
[125:50.54]No.
[125:51.36]But because they're so powerful, you still said no.
[125:54.35]Well, that was the 20% chance.
[125:55.63]And it comes out the balls.
[126:01.09]Oh, yeah, no.
[126:02.11]80% chance you get Super Saiyan children.
[126:06.17]They come out the balls, but you don't even get to raise them because the government takes them.
[126:12.63]Yeah, there's no positives here, Ster.
[126:16.19]Yeah, I can't see what is... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[126:21.09]If you're offering free Chinese food for life, then maybe.
[126:24.35]Yeah, the 20% needs to be, like, tuna subs for, like, fuckin' a year.
[126:28.63]Like, punch cards or something.
[126:29.49]The best you've ever had.
[126:30.27]I feel like all of your potions were great.
[126:33.60]Yeah, all of your were really fuckin' cool.
[126:34.96]Like, free offense paid trip to Bon Jovi camp.
[126:37.58]Like, then maybe.
[126:40.16]In New Jersey.
[126:41.20]Yeah.
[126:42.41]At his rest stop.
[126:45.51]Bon Jovi went to my school.

[127:14.70]Meat we were talking about earlier?
[127:16.68]It's a gremlin.
[127:17.68]Like a ghoul.
[127:18.78]Like, in the middle of the night, if you eat pasta too much, he shows up in your bed.
[127:23.58]And he's like, I'm the Gaba Ghoul.
[127:25.64]And he tries to like... Anyway, so what were we talking about?
[127:30.56]There was like a... Like you get pregnant with twins?
[127:34.43]That's cool.
[127:34.89]And the balls.
[127:36.99]That's sick.
[127:37.41]That would fucking hurt.
[127:40.53]I feel sick thinking about it.
[127:42.46]I don't like ball stuff.
[127:43.38]Like, you guys feel like you're annoyed?
[127:45.50]I'm not thinking about it that hard.
[127:46.72]You kind of brought up the ball stuff.
[127:48.46]Yeah, but... My bad.
[127:51.86]It's alright.
[127:52.92]I mean... Does it annoy you guys?
[127:54.15]Like, it annoys me?
[127:55.19]We got bat frogs.
[127:58.59]What he said.
[127:59.17]Does it annoy you?
[128:02.99]Like, it just bothers me.
[128:04.43]It feels painful.
[128:05.57]I just feel like... You know what I mean?
[128:08.27]I cringe.
[128:09.84]The enemies are too fast!
[128:11.42]I don't know.
[128:11.97]No, it's not great, man.
[128:12.97]I'll stop.
[128:13.37]I'll stop.
[128:14.29]No, you can talk about whatever you want.
[128:15.57]Ball stuff, whatever.
[128:16.68]Choking your homies.
[128:17.62]I don't know.
[128:17.98]Whatever.
[128:18.28]I like these frogs, though.
[128:21.26]They're pretty cool.
[128:24.26]I'm being told I'm being weird.
[128:25.44]Sorry, guys.
[128:26.26]You don't feel weird.
[128:27.17]We're talking about, like, Ster brought up a very weird topic.
[128:30.63]Ster is the weird one here.
[128:32.15]Ster is the weird guy.
[128:33.31]Oh, I'm the weird one.
[128:34.63]We're talking about potions and, like, fun, being fun.
[128:39.23]Oh, normal people talk about drinking wizard potions.
[128:42.71]But this is what's going to happen every time we stream for, like, a couple hours.
[128:46.53]After hour, like, three, it's just going to be brain rot.
[128:49.21]So...
[128:51.40]Guys, my mouse died and the frog just flew, I mean, it's flying me away.
[128:56.47]Help!
[128:57.57]Oh my god, you really are in the air!
[128:59.47]Hold on, can I shoot you out of his mouth?
[129:02.11]Oh, he's mega dead now.
[129:03.93]Oh, there he goes.
[129:05.31]I got him.
[129:07.18]You bounced more than a basketball coming off that.
[129:21.11]That's a good point.
[129:26.83]These things kind of look like those swimming bugs.
[129:30.53]You know the ones they're talking about, the ones that go underwater?
[129:34.64]Those beetles?
[129:35.64]No.
[129:37.76]They have a specific name.
[129:38.90]They're called like gliders or something.
[129:40.40]Yeah, I don't like killing these ones.
[129:46.08]These are...
[129:49.86]These are the good guys.
[129:51.72]As a frog fan, I'm a little upset about it myself, yeah.
[129:55.12]Water Strider, there it is, yeah.
[129:56.88]These ones are real cute.
[130:03.27]I like that there's just weird brain aliens and then just giant versions of what we have on Earth.
[130:09.41]It's like, it's really quite amazing.
[130:12.33]There's a ton of different, I feel like there are way more enemy types in this one.
[130:14.90]That's true.
[130:19.83]I mean, I should because it has all the old ones plus new ones.
[130:23.79]I saw before I saw the gray alien dude in the armor.
[130:26.80]That was cool.
[130:28.30]That's creepy.
[130:31.10]Yeah, they don't look like people at all.
[130:46.32]Yeah, of all people, poke.
[130:48.55]You're not the one who needs to apologize for being weird.
[130:51.44]Okay.
[130:53.24]It's me.
[130:55.46]No, it's me.
[130:57.02]Raise his hand.
[131:00.58]Well, I guess we can't play diaper games then, huh, Ster?
[131:05.17]That's not weird.
[131:07.45]Just do normal... Oh, I found a game!
[131:10.95]I found a game for us to play.
[131:12.23]What's the game?
[131:12.59]What's that?
[131:13.62]We're all getting in VR.
[131:16.95]Anything but VR, dude.
[131:18.97]Why?
[131:19.17]You don't like it?
[131:20.69]I got, like, a whole new setup.
[131:24.35]Like, I don't know, dude.
[131:25.99]It's a whole ordeal for me.
[131:28.00]I do have to say that when you and I played that VR game and we didn't even play the game, we were just sitting in, like, the armaments room just trying to put our arms behind our heads to shoot ourselves in the back of the head.
[131:42.45]Mm-hmm.
[131:43.03]It was... I mean, that's kind of... It was... That was...
[131:46.13]That was a wild day.
[131:51.08]I'm not even sure if my current one will work with a stream setup, but I'll look into it.
[131:57.10]What game though, Poke?
[132:02.75]I'll figure that out.
[132:04.75]But us being in VR would be fun.
[132:07.52]I think it'll be pretty funny.
[132:08.50]I just shot my own tank by accident.
[132:10.04]That's real cool.
[132:10.76]Yeah, I'm down for a VR stream.
[132:12.38]Oh, get in the road.
[132:13.16]Everybody get in this road.
[132:15.37]Where I am.
[132:16.61]Get in the road?
[132:21.55]No.
[132:22.01]Yeah.
[132:23.09]Okay, I'm going.
[132:24.91]Yep, alright.
[132:25.89]I think it's this road.
[132:29.05]What's with the road?
[132:30.99]This is where they fly in formation and they go into the meat grinder road.
[132:38.09]it might be the other one though Jerm I have a healing grenade I'm going to throw at you that'd be lovely I would be very happy okay um they're starting to come over here there we go

[133:58.19]The slugger is just so goddamn good.
[134:04.40]They're just frogs man, it's like shooting fish in a barrel Connect me to headquarters.
[134:10.06]Holy shit.
[134:10.52]That was good.
[134:10.90]I need to talk to the counselor It's just the um
[134:24.95]World of Warcraft phlegm.
[134:29.01]Isn't it?
[134:31.41]It looks like bell magic.
[134:32.93]You're right.
[134:34.12]Yeah, these are bell frogs.
[134:38.12]Looks like my purple custard.
[134:43.40]We need the eel.
[134:44.14]Do you have the green eel?
[134:49.72]What's that green eel?
[134:52.32]You have it.
[134:53.70]Oh, sorry, I'll throw that right at you.
[134:55.46]What's that noise?
[134:56.14]What is happening?
[134:57.96]Does that hurt?
[134:59.06]This noise is fucking crazy.
[135:03.14]What, the one that's going, what?
[135:04.88]No, the laser zapping these bugs from the wing divers.
[135:12.49]Oh, that is a weird noise.
[135:23.34]Tom Hanks voice.
[135:24.32]That's my Tom Hanks voice.
[135:25.40]Don't make me play that clip again.
[135:28.27]I'll do it and it's punishment for everybody.
[135:29.89]Please don't.
[135:31.55]I've had nightmares.
[135:32.31]I think we did pretty good.
[135:51.41]Getting the Tom Hanks voice is being in a lucid dream.
[135:54.67]Where it's like you're losing it every second you're losing it.
[135:58.41]And you're trying so hard not to pay attention to the fact that you are lucid dreaming.
[136:01.71]Which you do have a Tom Hanks voice.
[136:04.00]And you lose it because you wake up and you go, fuck, I just realized I was dreaming and I couldn't control it and I woke up.
[136:10.72]Wow.
[136:13.14]Can you guys lucid dream?
[136:13.90]Can you guys actually do it?
[136:14.64]I think we can.
[136:15.22]Stuart, you and I talked about this recently, didn't we?
[136:17.16]I can't.
[136:18.24]Did we?
[136:18.62]I thought so.
[136:21.90]Um... Oh, this is where they're in the road.
[136:24.74]I have a... I have a tale.
[136:31.39]Can you keep up with me?
[136:32.21]I have a dreaming tale.
[136:34.57]I'm thinking... Oh, God.
[136:38.35]I'll say this.
[136:38.91]When I was keeping a dream journal, I was more able to influence where my dreams were going.
[136:43.79]And a good chunk of my songs for the band came from dreams.
[136:49.98]So, yeah, kind of.
[136:51.88]And you're just going to take credit for him?
[136:53.23]That's not fucked.
[136:56.71]I mean, no one else's.
[136:57.95]They're his dreams.
[136:59.29]Did you credit the dreams?
[137:00.77]I don't think that dreams are yours.
[137:02.25]I don't think you get to claim them.
[137:03.71]I feel like they come from aliens.
[137:07.07]Dude, that's going to be really weird.
[137:08.55]Just fish them out of an ether.
[137:12.35]Weirdly, jokes aside, I kind of also, like, I credit...
[137:17.31]I don't take credit for some of those songs.
[137:19.25]I'm like, I don't know where the fuck that one came from.
[137:20.79]So someone's heading your way to get you now.
[137:24.47]You've been practicing with your band lately or something to put its minds together.
[137:29.70]Wait, what about it?
[137:30.42]You've been a busy band boy lately.
[137:32.32]I don't know.
[137:32.70]You've been.
[137:33.48]I have.
[137:34.04]Yeah, I have understood that.
[137:37.32]Is that heading to the hospital?
[137:39.12]Yeah, we only practice in my dreams.
[137:41.77]We only do.
[137:43.01]Yeah, counselor.
[137:45.22]But I was able to, yeah, I was able to lucid dream at a couple points in my life.
[137:48.33]But now that I haven't been writing my dreams down, I was getting some weird fucking dreams and I was writing down all of them and then I stopped keeping a journal and now I don't remember them.
[137:57.07]You know what's really weird?
[137:59.12]Kind of like on top of that point.
[138:01.16]I used to dream so vividly.
[138:03.76]Like very vividly.
[138:05.92]And I would wake up.
[138:07.04]It was like it was actually happening.
[138:08.84]If I got hurt in a dream, like let's say it broke my leg or like, you know, got like somebody with a chainsaw running after me.
[138:16.11]Again with the chainsaw guy?
[138:17.61]I can like feel it.
[138:18.69]Can you guys like actually, can you get hurt in your dreams?
[138:20.57]Like for me, it's as if I'm getting actually hurt in real life.
[138:24.24]Yeah.
[138:25.30]And then I will wake up with the worst headache I have ever had.
[138:29.18]And that used to happen.
[138:30.00]I would have these crazy vivid dreams and just have a monster, monster migraine.
[138:35.41]That doesn't happen in a long time.
[138:37.47]I wonder why.
[138:41.05]I wonder why that is.
[138:42.47]You're welcome.
[138:44.63]It's too much coffee.
[138:46.83]Think so?
[138:47.85]I don't know.
[138:49.91]You can't really predict the ether.
[138:52.02]It's the desert heat.
[138:54.02]It's the dry heat.
[138:55.74]Sorry, yeah, yeah.
[139:00.60]I guess it's maybe just getting older.
[139:02.16]Maybe just get used to these things and you just kind of like ignore them, tune them out.
[139:06.56]I don't know.
[139:08.00]Interesting.
[139:10.13]I told you guys I wanted to do an experiment where I'm talking about influencing your dreams and influencing things.
[139:17.21]I wanted to do a thing where I made a huge announcement that I was doing a huge stream and I was just going to have everybody think incredibly positive thoughts about me at the same exact time and see what happened.
[139:28.96]I'm pretty sure people have attempted that before.
[139:31.16]I think it's called a cult.
[139:32.08]I'm pretty sure people have done that shit.
[139:38.00]And it's also like, if you think about someone all at the same time with the same thought, does it happen?
[139:47.45]I don't know, because if it did, I'd be good at video games.
[139:52.33]They're thinking you're good?
[139:55.84]No, you're right, actually.
[139:56.70]Maybe that's why I'm so bad at video games.
[139:58.28]God damn it.
[140:00.20]They're mind-clouding you.
[140:01.14]They're doing the opposite.
[140:02.38]Everyone think Vinny's the best gamer now.
[140:04.76]Can we do an experiment, please?
[140:09.18]Before you go, there's four streams up right now.
[140:12.04]There's like 20, 30,000 people across all these streams, right?
[140:16.81]Can we just go around and see?
[140:18.71]Everybody at the same time, on the count of three, I want to think incredibly positive thoughts.
[140:24.97]I'm talking like health, wealth, every energy you can give to Ster.
[140:29.92]yeah yeah give us your money okay just serve alright no no no I'm just thinking like good thoughts at the same time can we do this that's like that's like throwing you go to the store and buy a new TV and come home and throw it in the garbage what to me I want to do it to everybody oh you said to me
[140:47.39]Yeah, but like, I want to do it one at a time.
[140:48.91]Alright.
[140:50.19]Ster first.
[140:50.79]Here we go.
[140:51.43]Alright, so... No, someone else first.
[140:53.17]Jesus.
[140:53.87]I'm trying to save humanity.
[140:55.49]I want to see if you start flying.
[140:57.41]I want to see if you start flying.
[140:58.47]Hold on.
[140:58.95]Okay.
[140:59.63]Ster.
[141:00.13]Open up, bro.
[141:01.43]Open up?
[141:03.04]Let it in.
[141:03.86]Okay, everybody, I'm not kidding.
[141:05.14]At the same time, across every stream, everybody think really good, positive, good shit or Ster energy.
[141:11.73]Very high energy, good stuff.
[141:13.33]I don't know, your eyes might be closed.
[141:15.63]That's fine.
[141:15.97]Just be like, Ster.
[141:16.73]You deserve everything.

[141:22.26]Everybody do it right now.
[141:23.56]There's too many contrarians.
[141:24.72]I'm getting a lot of hate.

[143:27.58]Okay.
[143:27.86]I think positive thoughts, Vinny, this headache is going to go away.
[143:31.06]We're all thinking, we're thinking like Tylenol, Advil, it's floating around you.
[143:37.20]The air pressure in your room is dropping, you know, like air pressure headaches.
[143:40.84]That's dropping right now.
[143:42.62]You can't breathe.
[143:43.45]It's all flooding out of the room rapidly.
[143:45.83]You ever see that video on YouTube, how to get rid of a headache?
[143:49.88]It's like, think about it.
[143:52.83]Think about it in your head.
[143:55.23]He asks questions like this.
[143:56.69]Are you ready?
[143:57.17]I'll do it to you.
[143:58.27]Ready, Vinny?
[143:58.93]Yeah, I'm ready.
[143:59.79]Alright, sit down.
[144:01.57]Okay.
[144:02.17]Think about the headache.
[144:02.97]Where is the headache in your head?
[144:05.99]Front left.
[144:07.75]And what color is the headache?
[144:12.23]Purple.
[144:14.21]Just think about it.
[144:14.81]Don't say it out loud.
[144:15.35]Just think about it really hard.
[144:16.87]Okay.
[144:17.45]And... What shape is the headache?
[144:22.51]Mm-hmm.
[144:24.49]And... Where is it again?
[144:28.73]Okay.
[144:29.13]Dude, I got a pain in my groin right now.
[144:30.61]What just happened?
[144:33.17]On my left side of my groin.
[144:34.61]No, I'm telling you.
[144:35.61]You guys never see this video?
[144:37.90]It works.
[144:38.82]That's all I was thinking.
[144:39.90]I was just sending needles...
[144:45.70]I swear to God, I saw this video had like a million views like 10 years ago.
[144:48.76]How do I get rid of any headache?
[144:53.27]Yeah, my purple banana shaped headache is still around.
[144:57.41]But I'm, you know.
[144:59.43]Oh yeah, I'm sending it back to you.
[145:03.37]I'm sending a ton of needles your way too.
[145:05.53]And how does that make you feel?
[145:10.77]No, stop.
[145:13.83]Guys, I think I'm good.
[145:15.14]I'm sorry.
[145:15.52]I have to bounce.
[145:17.20]The headache has really genuinely only gotten worse.
[145:20.46]No, it got worse.
[145:21.70]What did you guys do?
[145:22.18]I found the video.
[145:23.26]Wait, are we doing one more you want to do?
[145:25.80]Alright, one more.
[145:26.74]It's fine.
[145:27.16]I'll do one more and then I'll leave.
[145:28.50]I parried it and all your needles went into Viddy's head.
[145:31.08]Thanks a lot.
[145:33.16]Two minutes, no headache.
[145:34.63]I'm actually, I'm going to do that live on stream after I'm done here.
[145:37.79]Okay, got it.
[145:39.15]Oh, this is a big one.
[145:42.20]This is a big mission?
[145:42.96]Yeah.
[145:45.42]Oh.
[145:46.60]You gotta click ready again.
[145:47.68]Somebody disconnect it.
[145:48.82]All jokes aside though Vinny, I'm sorry you got a headache.
[145:51.26]I hate headaches.
[145:52.04]I get them all the time and they're the worst.
[145:53.30]Just watch it right now.
[145:53.94]Let's see if it works.
[145:58.11]I will.
[145:58.49]After the stream I will.
[145:59.49]I, you know, yeah, I was like... Nah, fuck it.
[146:05.75]Just breathe.
[146:07.22]My headache stuff is usually only like it lasts a little while or it's like a dehydration headache because I forget to drink too much water.
[146:14.41]And it's like, what am I doing?
[146:15.35]Yeah.
[146:16.15]Yeah.
[146:17.31]I'm too lazy to go to the fridge and get a water.
[146:18.97]So I've been, I've been thirsty for like this whole time.
[146:25.73]I'll be back.
[146:26.59]I feel for you.
[146:27.85]I've been dehydrating like Hugh Jackman and Wolverine so that I could look awesome.
[146:31.47]I just want to like, is that how that works?
[146:34.35]You just like don't drink water for like two weeks.
[146:37.49]Yeah.
[146:38.73]Sending needles.
[146:42.57]Like a psychic scream.
[146:44.01]You're sending, like, psychic damage over here.
[146:46.92]Yeah, I practice.
[146:47.98]I've got all, you know, my potions.
[146:50.24]You wrote, like, a whole book about fucking, like, psychic damage, didn't you?
[146:55.32]Yeah.
[146:57.40]I guess.
[146:57.80]I gotta be careful around you.
[146:58.92]What do you mean you wrote a book about psychic damage?
[147:02.89]I don't know what he's talking about.
[147:04.21]The Myrion.
[147:06.52]Oh, it's not a book.
[147:08.38]I mean, it was Dungeons & Dragons.
[147:12.25]Essentially.
[147:15.01]I've done lots of how to send psychic pain to the groin research.
[147:23.48]Now, can you send psychic pain to someone in their past?
[147:28.05]Like, say, two years, three months, 14 days ago.
[147:32.43]Can you do that?
[147:34.01]Time travel plot's not good.
[147:38.56]I like that, Vinny.
[147:39.82]I love that one.
[147:41.66]Those are the things, man.
[147:43.56]I'm sorry because I I have a thing I talk about on the stream and people just don't they don't want to like accept it they think I'm like making a up but if you're like say you you die and you respawn say you could like maybe you didn't do a good job in this life maybe you respawn as a peasant in like you know 12 36.
[148:03.37]And people are like, Vinny, that's impossible.
[148:05.77]I'm like, oh, respawning, like reincarnation is possible, but you can't go back in time.
[148:09.64]And people are like, no, you can't.
[148:11.62]There's no such thing as time-traveling ghosts.
[148:17.22]I see where you're coming from.
[148:19.86]Right?
[148:20.18]I mean, it doesn't seem that illogical to me.
[148:24.18]Yeah, if you're opening up doors, you can't close some of them.
[148:28.86]You gotta be open-minded to the time-traveling ghost.
[148:32.07]There's a gigantic spider over here, and it's gotten very close.
[148:40.65]We'll shoot it.
[148:41.57]Wait, does it poke here?
[148:43.39]I'm here.
[148:43.69]Okay.
[148:44.23]I'll just... I think he was getting some water, right?
[148:47.85]How's that water?
[148:49.69]Good.
[148:51.96]My mom's here, too.
[148:52.76]She's making food.
[148:54.74]Really?
[148:55.70]Yes.
[148:56.24]Salmon and rice and potatoes.
[148:59.66]That sounds amazing.
[149:00.74]You like rice.
[149:01.65]I know that about you now.
[149:02.39]I'm so excited.
[149:03.37]I'm so excited.
[149:05.77]Frick.
[149:07.33]So, Jerma, being on the West Coast, did you not eat dinner before the stream or what?
[149:14.71]I usually will do a smoothie before a stream nowadays.
[149:18.93]Before a stream.
[149:22.08]so you do a smoothie and then what like you just have dinner later yeah it's like we'll make something usually can you wait can you only eat liquids these days um supposed to be like an old man joke just worried wait I feel like Ster is the same age as us is that not true
[149:42.47]Oh, no, no, that's right.
[149:43.25]You're younger.
[149:43.73]You're going to turn like 32, aren't you?
[149:46.23]No.
[149:46.44]Aren't I older than you guys?
[149:49.08]I'm 34.
[149:50.18]Oh.
[149:50.72]Coming up.
[149:51.48]Look at you, a baby.
[149:52.66]Look at this guy.
[149:53.82]I called him a tank.
[149:54.62]I got you, Vinny.
[150:00.94]Thanks.
[150:02.57]Okay, Vinny, on my 40th birthday, I'm going to do the positive energy towards you as long as you reciprocate it back to me.
[150:10.18]Yeah, on May 12th.
[150:12.32]You guys doing sub for sub?
[150:14.20]Yeah.
[150:15.73]Manny for Manny.
[150:17.87]Oh, the fuck was in front of the cannon?
[150:20.39]Yeah, you killed us.
[150:26.00]Fest for fest.
[150:27.16]You guys never get in the tank.
[150:32.31]Dude, that tank gets killed in four seconds.
[150:36.50]Because no one is in it.
[150:38.28]I'm coming.
[150:39.24]Come on.
[150:39.80]Are you doing anything special for your 40th Jerm?
[150:56.57]No.
[150:57.09]I mean, it's still some time off, so you don't have to think about it too hard, but yeah.
[151:01.89]I do this thing where I just say that I'm a year older, so I can already be ready and prepared for it.
[151:07.85]I'm already telling people I'm 40, and it's just like, it's like lessening the impact.
[151:11.84]Yeah.
[151:15.10]I want to do, I'm going to be at PAX.
[151:17.82]Like, I think PAX next year, PAX East, is like a week before my birthday.
[151:23.61]You ever got a Vegas trip in you?
[151:24.67]Ever got a time to come to Vegas?
[151:27.43]I haven't flown in 12 years, but my Vegas trip would definitely be not a lot of gambling, but maybe like a Star Trek convention I would go to.
[151:37.05]Okay.
[151:40.79]Gambling's lame.
[151:44.24]I'll go to Vegas and hang, though.
[151:45.54]Sorry, there's going to be more to that.
[151:47.24]You go to Vegas and you get a pancake is the real play.
[151:54.59]There's some good food out here.
[151:55.93]I'm so fucked.
[151:56.29]All dead.
[151:57.15]We're all dead.
[151:58.31]Wow, we all... Wait, oh, they said take that back?
[152:01.85]I'm surprised.
[152:02.77]Oh, yeah, go to csgolotto.com, kids.
[152:08.42]What's got you so mad today?
[152:11.42]What has got you so mad today?
[152:13.58]This whole ball thing.
[152:15.86]Yeah.
[152:17.18]Yeah.
[152:17.77]Alright, listen, for real, I'm going to go this time.
[152:19.41]Head, not good.
[152:23.08]Oh, so you have to leave and everyone else to go now.
[152:25.64]Damn.
[152:26.24]I know.
[152:27.29]You guys can keep playing.
[152:28.05]No, I'm kidding.
[152:28.81]I really don't mind.
[152:29.89]I'm starving, so I'm blaming you.
[152:32.39]Come on, Vinny.
[152:33.97]Come on, Vinny.
[152:35.51]I'm starving.
[152:36.35]Oh, hey, we didn't do the positive message thing for me.
[152:39.49]Alright, so everybody, all the chats, all the collective chats, I want you to think of Jerma as being like super, like his muscles are fucking bursting.
[152:50.28]Whoa.
[152:51.30]Like his muscles are so strong.
[152:53.44]Okay.
[152:55.94]Alright, do that now.
[152:56.78]Close your eyes.
[152:57.36]Focus on the left arm only first.
[152:59.32]Get one arm at a time.
[153:02.20]His left arm's looking a little frail.
[153:03.84]Let's pump it up.
[153:05.86]This isn't doing anything.
[153:09.15]I want your thoughts to flow into his bicep like his blood cells will.
[153:15.40]Pump it up!
[153:16.52]Okay, you'll never have any of another man.
[153:18.54]Vinny, it's always great to see you.
[153:20.60]You too.
[153:21.28]You're awesome.
[153:22.32]Everybody loves Vinny.
[153:23.12]Give it up for Vinny.
[153:23.92]Everybody clap for Vinny, please.
[153:25.58]That's categorically untrue, but thank you, Jerma.
[153:28.30]I appreciate you.
[153:31.24]I really like this group.
[153:32.30]You guys are awesome.
[153:33.10]Thanks for inviting me.
[153:34.24]I always like playing games with you guys.
[153:36.85]yeah I'm gonna go now you're you're always always always always welcome every time bye thank you bye poke enjoy your and you enjoy your food and Ster enjoy your uh what are you writing a book you're writing a book don't worry about it alright Jeremiah see you later bye guys
[153:59.57]uh yeah okay thanks plane awesome it was fun I had a great time a lot of great combos this time I think it was good it was nice very nice uh so next game next week um I'll write some down we had we had pilgrim on the list there was another that was mentioned I don't recall that was sounded nice
[154:31.74]Does anyone have, like, a 10-minute... I really would want to see Ster lose his fucking mind in Mario Party.
[154:41.39]Yeah, I'm down for that, too.
[154:44.73]That might be my pick when we cycle back around.
[154:48.13]Like, old Mario Party would be really fun.
[154:50.63]Mm-hmm.
[154:51.54]yeah oh um abiotic factor I think vinny has played it I don't know how much he's played I was gonna ask if he's like did the whole thing but I think there was an update I'm down for that but I think it's like once a week would be not possible you know I mean we have to be like locked in on that
[155:15.31]Yeah, yeah, and it might be like a multi-day thing.
[155:18.63]Yeah, multiple days.
[155:19.81]How long is it?
[155:20.53]Have you played it?
[155:24.35]No, I haven't.
[155:25.49]But if we're going to play games like that, we should also play 7 Days to Die.
[155:28.07]That's a good one.
[155:30.27]I've actually never.
[155:32.01]I love that game.
[155:33.15]Super good.
[155:34.67]Okay, you can be the guide.
[155:37.66]I'm down for whatever.
[155:39.16]But these games are more than a few hours, once a week.
[155:43.64]We have to be
[155:46.01]dedicated if we want to do that I think well you know what they say the the four horsemen ride at dawn we didn't even figure out who was who we all just yelled out ones we wanted to be but never figured it out well that's that's so the four horsemen they don't really play by the rules uh because it's the mortals that give us our our names not ourselves
[156:09.92]Well, I'll let them decide who I am.
[156:11.34]Well, we predate the seven trumpets and then the seven bowls.
[156:15.05]So there's a lot more that happens after we show up.
[156:17.25]Obviously.
[156:18.77]That's a weird way to say goodbye.
[156:26.22]That's the weirdest goodbye you've ever done.
[156:29.50]I'm not good at goodbyes.
[156:30.20]Alright.
[156:31.92]You guys are awesome.
[156:32.58]Thanks for playing.
[156:33.66]Good to see you.
[156:34.06]See you again soon.
[156:34.52]Thanks for playing, dudes.
[156:35.92]Love you guys.
[156:36.48]Bye-bye.
[156:40.30]Hey!
[156:40.94]And that's that.
[156:41.42]That was a fun one.
[156:42.72]I think at some point, like halfway through this one, we just kind of... It's like, who gives a shit?
[156:48.83]Let's just fucking... Let's just like, you know, yuck it up a little.
[156:52.73]Sometimes it's fun just to yuck it up.
[157:04.17]Yeah, the next time I'll see you guys on whenever we get maybe something like this going.
[157:10.09]It's funny because like, oh yeah, yeah, I'll stream next week.
[157:14.33]Yeah.
[157:18.81]It is what it is.
[157:19.85]I'm having fun.
[157:23.67]But one day only.
[157:25.59]It was a pretty good gas leak stream.
[157:27.16]Yeah.
[157:38.50]to do Dark and Darker.
[157:45.59]There's plenty of stuff to still do in these, you know, just kind of chilling out streams, just playing with people.
[157:52.73]Yeah, I'm down.
[157:57.69]Yeah, thanks guys for watching.
[157:59.17]I'll see you guys again soon.
[158:01.40]Take care of yourselves.
[158:04.62]And yeah, EDF is really fun.
[158:06.60]If you have never played it, I know we were fucking around a lot this stream, but definitely play some EDF.
[158:13.36]It's fun.
[158:15.18]Worms was fun too.
[158:16.04]Okay, here's the thing about the Worms portion of the stream today.
[158:19.52]I think we all underestimated how difficult the game actually is and we just like kind of blew each other up accidentally with grenades and stuff.
[158:28.55]That game is a challenge.
[158:29.51]That is a challenging game.
[158:31.15]It is not like, oh yeah, it's worms.
[158:32.73]Just like, throw the grenade.
[158:34.21]You gotta be ready.
[158:34.85]You gotta account for wind.
[158:35.95]It was still fun though.
[158:39.03]It was really funny.
[158:40.03]It was... I feel like I laughed a lot this stream.
[158:43.03]I feel like my stomach hurts.
[158:45.42]A lot of crazy shit happening.
[158:46.56]But yeah, I'll talk to you guys soon.
[158:49.18]Take care.
