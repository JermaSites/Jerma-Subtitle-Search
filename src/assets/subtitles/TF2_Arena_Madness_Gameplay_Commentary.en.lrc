[00:09.38]Hey everybody, what's going on?
[00:10.40]It's Jerma again with a gameplay commentary.
[00:13.00]More like multiple gameplay commentaries, because this is a new series I'm doing called Arena Madness, which is where I play three or four classes in a row on two or three different maps on Arena.
[00:23.11]Arena only, so if you don't like Arena, if you're not an Arena fan, I'm sorry, but this is about 15 or 16 minutes long, so grab the popcorn for this one, guys.
[00:31.81]Playing as the Demoman on Arena Badlands for the first of these four gameplays, I believe it is.
[00:36.95]Get that scout with a nice shot from the Splendid Screen and the Persian Persuader.
[00:40.75]So that's half the load out of the match.
[00:42.34]The other half is the grenade launcher, as you'll see here.
[00:45.06]Kill that sniper with a nice couple of shots.
[00:47.22]And this is great.
[00:48.02]This setup is unbelievable if you're going to play on an arena match, especially because you can get healed like that from anything on the ground.
[00:55.26]It doesn't matter if it's a health pack, ammo, if it's somebody's gun - that's the best part about doing this.
[00:59.26]Because as you know, arena matches, your health is so important.
[01:05.49]Barrel into that scout, I'm trying to get him to run over one of the grenades but he doesn't end up doing it.
[01:11.49]Instead he just starts to taunt and I don't know if he was a bot or not. I don't think he was but regardless it's a nice direct shot anyways.
[01:18.49]Top beehiving like a bee's nest, as you can see there.
[01:21.89]We're gonna move on to the next one now.
[01:23.29]This is still a Demoman.
[01:24.49]The next two, I believe, are gonna be Demoman gameplays.
[01:27.65]After that, it's a Pyro.
[01:28.84]And then after that, I believe it's Sniper and then Engineer.
[01:32.34]So you got plenty of stuff to look forward to if you're a fan of any of the classes.
[01:36.20]Stay tuned, alright?
[01:37.38]Because there's a lot of stuff here.
[01:39.78]Starting this one out, just absolutely spamming into this little corridor over there, I get a random kill, and you heard the ding-a-lings, I got a ton of damage on so many other people that were there, which is huge because there's no health packs to pick up, unless of course you're a Demoman using this setup, or you're being healed by a Medic or a Dispenser, but that's the only way to get health in an Arena match.
[02:01.55]A lot of people don't know that, that health is not available, and they go, where are the health packs when they come into a game.
[02:07.51]So I shoot my last three shots over the cliff here trying to get some random hit.
[02:11.00]And now we're just straight up Demoknight and there's nothing I can do about it because with this setup you cannot replenish your ammo at all.
[02:17.00]But that's fine because arena matches don't really last that long anyways.
[02:20.00]So I'd be a real demo spy as you'll see. I'll try to explain this, look at this.
[02:26.00]See I come around the back and I'm being a real demo spy, I thought somebody saw me because somebody detonated a sticky I was like whoa whoa whoa hold on a second.
[02:33.70]But watch this super lag mode.
[02:35.85]Oh, I was so pissed about that.
[02:37.13]But it doesn't end up mattering at all because I end up smashing this guy, picking up his health, which would be his ammo.
[02:44.19]Uber heavy on the point.
[02:45.09]Now it's three to three.
[02:46.45]This heavy didn't even see me, so it's his demise.
[02:49.17]I take his head off with his head.
[02:52.28]Final person is a scout right here.
[02:54.66]I crush him with the shield and then my teammates get the final kill on the other scout that was down there.
[02:59.24]So we are the winners.
[03:00.68]I didn't top Gordy Smith like a Gord, so that's too bad.
[03:04.08]But anyways, let's move on to the next one.
[03:06.18]This is the final Demoman gameplay of the series.
[03:09.43]This one starts off okay, but as you'll see, I really, really blow the first blood buff.
[03:14.11]I was so pissed about it, you guys don't even know, I was freaking out because it would have been so awesome.
[03:18.57]You'll see, I get under the bridge, smash this pyro, I have the buff now, and here we go.
[03:23.34]Ugh, I don't do anything with it.
[03:25.26]I didn't even have grenades loaded into the chamber.
[03:27.58]If I had turned up here with that first blood buff, I could have killed like five people with those grenades.
[03:33.66]It would have been insane.
[03:35.50]So now I'm just trying to help my teammates right here.
[03:37.53]There's a heavy medic pair going into their spawn area.
[03:40.57]Just trying to get a couple grenades in there.
[03:41.99]I get somebody with a random one.
[03:43.67]Direct shot this guy.
[03:44.77]See the spy.
[03:45.63]And that's three kills in a row.
[03:47.71]And now I'm just kind of trying to patrol the area to see if anyone else is around.
[03:51.61]There's one person that's kind of floating around somewhere.
[03:54.05]I don't know where he is.
[03:54.73]I'm sure he's back by the spawn.
[03:56.65]So it doesn't end up mattering at all because I got the place guarded.
[03:59.62]And the heavy medic pair down there gets the kill, I believe.
[04:02.16]Or I think it's actually a scout.
[04:03.26]It is a scout.
[04:04.46]We win the match, and I get 5 kills out of 10 people, which is pretty good if you ask me, especially on Arena.
[04:10.20]So let's move on to the Pyro.
[04:11.48]The Pyro loadout for the first match is going to be the Degreaser, the Shotgun, and the Powerjack.
[04:17.29]I didn't want to use the Powerjack, but Steam was having all kinds of issues the last couple of days with item loadouts.
[04:23.90]So I don't even equip it.
[04:25.50]I don't even take it out one time, so don't worry.
[04:27.48]It doesn't matter.
[04:29.10]Coming around the back here, trying to be a good pyro.
[04:31.38]See this scout.
[04:32.42]Light him on fire, and he tries to run away, and I end up getting the kill on him.
[04:35.46]Not with the shotgun, but the afterburn, which is kind of odd, because we were both shooting at him with the shotgun.
[04:40.05]This heavy is not paying attention.
[04:41.47]He goes down.
[04:42.25]I thought I was screwed, but I do end up killing him with the shotgun.
[04:45.44]Me and the soldier down here trying to be a little cautious because we were down by about three people.
[04:48.44]Now it's tied and now we are ahead, a heavy just completely dominated like three or four people right there.
[04:55.44]There's a sniper here, he's not really paying attention to his left so I take him out just with the flamethrower.
[05:00.82]I think he's a spy but no that's just my soldier buddy.
[05:04.00]Get an assist with the shotgun on that scout and now it's four to two and when it just a second ago was nine to six in their favor.
[05:09.00]Come around the back here, this heavy does not know that I'm gonna do this for some reason, I get him with a shotgun kill and now it's four to one.
[05:16.00]We have this pretty much in the bag, we came back from a pretty high deficit. I get killed by the needle gun and he kills two people with that needle gun.
[05:23.00]He came pretty close to the amount of health- look at that health, he came pretty damn close to taking that whole thing back so...
[05:30.53]Good try for that medic.
[05:32.71]This next pyro gameplay is going to replace the shotgun with the detonator, the new uber update item for the pyro.
[05:38.44]This is the same thing as the flare gun, except you can detonate him in midair like this.
[05:44.18]Ooh, and watch what happens.
[05:46.46]Detonated at the right time.
[05:48.23]I got somebody.
[05:49.09]I have no idea how.
[05:49.85]I thought that was really cool, though.
[05:51.25]Just a long-range blind detonation, and I got somebody.
[05:54.53]I get an assist for that, too, by the way.
[05:56.97]Come down here just to try and do a couple more random detonations.
[06:00.17]And let me talk about the detonator for just one second.
[06:02.90]I don't care that it has less crit damage.
[06:04.88]I know that's a big problem for some people.
[06:06.82]And hold on just a second.
[06:07.58]I almost get myself killed here.
[06:09.70]I almost just run into my own death.
[06:11.70]I got to blow this scout out too because he's on fire.
[06:13.62]And I'm looking for him.
[06:14.42]I thought he ran behind me, but he's right there.
[06:15.82]I get him.
[06:16.18]Don't worry.
[06:17.65]So it's six to four now.
[06:18.95]We have a pretty good advantage now.
[06:20.69]I come up here.
[06:21.29]There's a sniper that I pick off.
[06:23.15]Nice shot.
[06:23.71]He doesn't think I'm going to go this way.
[06:25.25]He tries to go the other direction.
[06:26.59]I get him with a crit.
[06:28.17]40 damage is okay.
[06:29.50]That's fine for me, like I was saying before.
[06:31.82]I get a nice shot.
[06:32.36]This is a good example right here of why the detonator is great.
[06:34.72]End the game.
[06:35.68]I didn't even come close to hitting him, but I detonated it at the right time, and we win.
[06:40.22]Time to move on to the sniper and the map changes as well.
[06:44.64]We move on to Granary.
[06:46.78]I'm a sniper, like I said before, using the sniper rifle, of course, the Shahanshah, and the Darwin's shield, I believe.
[06:55.53]Yep, the Darwin's danger shield.
[06:57.53]So I have been practicing with the sniper rifle.
[06:59.87]I wanted to get good with it, and I found, as you'll see, bang, quickscoping is all I can do, and I do very, very well with quickscoping.
[07:09.21]I can't sit there in camp and get a headshot.
[07:11.59]I over-aim, I under-aim, I'm terrible when I hold the thing down and wait for it to get a charge.
[07:17.80]And you will see, I don't think there is one time in either of these two sniper gameplays that I wait for it to get even halfway of a charge.
[07:26.08]Here's another quick scope headshot.
[07:28.16]I don't know.
[07:28.92]I have such ADD and such ADHD that I can't stand to have to sit there and wait.
[07:35.71]And some of these headshots should have definitely registered, but they didn't.
[07:39.31]Like right there, I thought for sure that I got that guy right in the side of the face, but I guess not.
[07:44.52]So five to three, this is looking grim for our team.
[07:47.00]It ends up- it actually has a pretty cool ending even though it's a complete failure.
[07:51.00]Five to two now, I'm trying to find a place where I can sneak and look it's five to one.
[07:56.00]I get a nice little body shot on that soldier, I'm trying to hide.
[07:58.00]They know I'm here. I'm trying to jump around all over the place. Nice headshot quick scope on his face.
[08:04.00]Four to one now I thought I could get a head shot I thought I could pick them off from above like a bird of prey.
[08:10.47]Don't get a headshot right there.
[08:11.81]And now I'm just like, you know what?
[08:13.23]Screw it.
[08:13.53]They're going to get the point.
[08:14.51]I'm just going to go up there and kamikaze.
[08:17.39]And he ends up killing himself on me.
[08:19.23]So I ended up killing like three people right there.
[08:21.17]So take it for what it is, I guess.
[08:24.34]So this is the second sniper gameplay, and you'll see the same scout does the same path, but I miss him this time.
[08:30.46]Or do I?
[08:31.48]That's what you'll see in the end result.
[08:32.94]Bang, right in his face.
[08:34.56]Coming around the corner, another scout.
[08:36.12]I tried to pick off with a headshot.
[08:37.44]That would have been sick if I got both of those scouts.
[08:40.27]Because we all know that scouts on arena maps are incredibly powerful.
[08:43.35]They're like the main artery of arena maps.
[08:46.97]They're the ones that get all the stuff done.
[08:48.85]They're the ones that are running around, killing people, capping points.
[08:51.83]So getting rid of scouts is incredibly important.
[08:55.22]Nice headshot there.
[08:56.36]It doesn't matter.
[08:57.04]He was overhealed, and he was a heavy anyways.
[08:59.12]He wouldn't have died.
[08:59.80]I get an assist on him, though, which is pretty cool.
[09:02.46]So this is one of the only times I charge to about full, and I miss.
[09:06.43]See?
[09:06.93]I'm awful when I have to wait, even though I've missed like half of the quickscope shots anyways.
[09:11.37]But you get the idea.
[09:13.01]Coming up this little area here, I want to make sure I can get a nice spot.
[09:16.28]I end up getting a nice quick little headshot on this Demoman right here.
[09:19.02]Spank, but didn't kill him, but I get the assist.
[09:22.66]I saw that there was a medic down there and I figured that the heavy medic pair would be right here, which they are.
[09:27.00]I come down here get a quickscope headshot probably could have saved the day potentially but there was an uber down there anyways.
[09:32.00]And then the final person is a medic. Where is he? Nobody knows.
[09:37.00]There he is. Headshot to end the game.
[09:40.00]And now we are going to move on to the engineer.
[09:43.00]This is the final one and it is the most devastating. I kill- well you'll see, I do very very well.
[09:50.84]So playing as the combat engineer using the Mini-Sentry, the frontier justice and the pistol, starting it up trying to get this dispenser built because this is the only way people can heal themselves without a medic, it's very very important if you play engineer make sure the first thing you do before doing anything is building a dispenser.
[10:10.31]And as you can see, we had 10 people on the team and we just got demolished right there.
[10:15.12]Nice shotgun kill on that scout.
[10:16.54]And here comes another scout.
[10:17.50]I thought for sure I was going to be able to kill this guy.
[10:19.88]Pull out the pistol and... Nope, not enough.
[10:22.90]I get a lot of people with stray bullets though.
[10:25.33]I don't want to get too overzealous over there because I am only an engineer.
[10:28.23]And watch, what is this other engineer even doing?
[10:30.45]He's just switching his weapons out over and over again.
[10:33.96]I don't know.
[10:34.40]I have no idea.
[10:35.56]It could be a bot.
[10:36.42]I don't know.
[10:36.82]Because arena matches, they're very, very synonymous with not having people play in them.
[10:40.86]So at least two or three people on each team will probably be a bot.
[10:44.27]At least in my opinion.
[10:45.65]Get a nice shot with that shotgun.
[10:46.97]Get another shotgun kill.
[10:48.37]And my Mini-Sentry killed somebody before that.
[10:50.21]So that's pure awesomeness right there.
[10:53.43]This sentry gets placed in a very sneaky spot.
[10:55.66]And it kills two people right off the bat.
[10:57.98]And you'll see the numbers.
[10:59.24]Check it out what happens.
[11:00.80]Three to two.
[11:02.36]two to one now is what it ends up being after that last century kill it's me versus these last two people so let's see what happens I have some crits I'm ready to rock and roll place the century down do I get the kill yes I do and what happens one on one who is gonna win this battle it's gonna be me with my mini century seven kills and one assist I ended up killing like
[11:25.52]almost the entire team right there so that was pretty awesome and thank you guys all for watching again I appreciate it I'll see you all next time take care everybody
