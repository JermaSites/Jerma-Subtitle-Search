[00:01.35]Look who's back.
[00:03.33]Back again.
[00:05.35]Jerma's back.
[00:07.10]Tell all your friends and tell them to subscribe to me too.
[00:12.36]Hey guys.
[00:17.24]Dad is home.
[00:21.43]It's been a while.
[00:22.09]This coffee is old.
[00:27.61]That's what you get.
[00:32.81]I'm gonna make a tweet.
[00:34.39]I'll be right back.
[00:35.39]See ya.
[00:56.63]Somebody just said you can go offline at any time.
[01:02.01]That's true.
[01:05.03]I don't think I would hold an audience for very long if I just turned my stream off in 20 minutes.
[01:16.05]Hey, thanks for watching, everybody.
[01:17.71]Yeah, I'm going.
[01:18.57]Bye.
[01:18.77]I'll just turn it off.
[01:20.25]We've been here for like 15, 20 minutes or so.
[01:22.51]I do that every day.
[01:25.63]Nobody would watch this channel.
[01:31.96]We wouldn't even get anything started.
[01:37.86]Okay, what are we doing?
[01:38.52]We're doing Dreams tonight.
[01:40.30]There's a Dreams Early Access.
[01:43.48]And those of you that know, the Dreams is one of my most anticipated video games of 2019.
[01:47.48]I want to play it.
[01:55.33]Please turn off the stream.
[01:58.35]No, I know, look, I know a lot, here's the thing.
[02:00.67]I know a bunch of people say...
[02:02.78]Nah man, you could like, you could like paint a fence and I'd watch it.
[02:05.78]That's like the meme, that's the joke, right?
[02:07.82]But... Imagine if I painted a fence every day.
[02:12.02]Eventually, after three or four full houses in the neighborhood done.
[02:18.00]You'd pro- you'd start asking about something else.
[02:22.17]Oh cool, you got another painted, uh, painted fence in the neighborhood, that's cool.
[02:27.95]Are you gonna play Devil May Cry at any point?
[02:30.25]No.
[02:30.96]We're gonna do this for, like, the next six months.
[02:33.33]Oh.
[02:34.29]Um... Alright, man, like, looking forward to it.
[02:37.05]Yeah, but what if I built a birdhouse every stream?
[02:45.15]I mean, maybe... I would say at least 50% of people would be gone after the fifth birdhouse stream in a row.
[02:53.29]Alright, I haven't streamed in a while, so how do I do a tweet?
[02:56.50]Oh, like this.
[02:59.55]uh dreams and a couple of z's that sounds good to me yeah there we go zzz that looks good but yeah I um my time off was great it was well spent with family it was a great relaxing time it was great to see everybody too so I'm completely satisfied
[03:29.07]And I am ready to go back into the virtual internet world of broadcasting.
[03:37.11]So what do you say we do that now?
[03:38.87]I'm gonna change it over.
[03:39.67]And here comes Dreams!
[03:45.58]Let's load it.
[03:48.38]Why don't you stream with your mom?
[03:49.82]My mom doesn't want to be on stream.
[03:55.77]So again, this is Dreams.
[03:56.69]This is a mix of... I haven't played it yet, so I can tell you maybe a little bit of a preface to this whole thing.
[04:04.33]I believe that this is sort of a combination of 3D Movie Maker and Tilt Brush.
[04:12.47]That's kind of what I've gathered.
[04:15.84]Alright.
[04:16.22]Welcome, intrepid creators.
[04:18.52]Before you get your hands on the Creator Early Access, we'd like to remind you of the following.
[04:23.12]Uh-oh.
[04:24.82]We have a warning sign.
[04:27.07]This is early access software that means it's not the finished product.
[04:29.91]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:31.69]During early access, we may modify the software without... I didn't even get a chance to read it.
[04:37.91]What?
[04:42.29]I want to read that.
[04:42.89]I want to go back and read that.
[04:44.79]Hey!
[04:45.91]Do you want to allow your pro... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[04:48.47]Hold on.
[04:50.32]Do you want to allow your user profile and creations to be public on the web at indreams.me?
[04:56.82]You can change this anytime in the, I mean, I guess, yeah.
[05:02.84]We believe in giving credit where it's due, but we need your explicit permission to do this.
[05:06.41]Would you like us to display your online ID alongside your creations in any promotional videos or on our live streams?
[05:14.67]Well, my online ID is not me.
[05:20.31]It's like a made-up name.
[05:22.27]So, okay, let's just say that I created something here, and it's like the best thing that anyone's ever seen.
[05:27.37]It's gonna be my, like, fucked-up, shitty PlayStation 4 name.
[05:30.90]It's not gonna be me.
[05:32.40]I'm giving credit to my stage name.
[05:33.80]Alright, hold on.
[05:39.88]Um... But, okay, who cares, though, right?
[05:45.15]Because I know I did it, and you all know that I did it, so if it pops up anywhere, everyone will just know.
[05:54.33]That doesn't matter.
[05:54.87]Eh, no.
[05:59.04]I don't want them to use my goddamn name.
[06:03.00]What, we're gonna get an intro video?
[06:07.06]Hello.
[06:09.70]Bonjour.
[06:11.84]Hola.
[06:14.18]Ciao.
[06:15.65]Hello.
[06:17.49]This tube, they're filling too many people.
[06:18.61]Stop spawning people.
[06:19.35]You're gonna crash the fucking server.
[06:23.07]Hello.
[06:27.77]I just got $100.
[06:28.49]I haven't even been back for five minutes.
[06:36.93]Thank you to JermaLied about Ace Attorney.
[06:40.03]No, I didn't.
[06:42.31]Alright, I need to address that.
[06:43.65]This is like a big tutorial coming up here.
[06:45.59]Beginning.
[06:48.11]Nothing.
[06:50.31]Hold on.
[06:51.17]No movement.
[06:53.20]No sound.
[06:55.22]complete emptiness then a spec an idea the idea could be anything it could be it could even be everything no not loud incoming we're good light
[07:29.04]That's actually not exciting.
[07:57.09]Tall guy!
[07:57.59]Alright, wait, I can't.
[07:58.45]I'm not doing this anymore.
[08:00.51]I have to make my own imp?
[08:18.02]Choose your imp!
[08:21.18]Wait, hold on.
[08:22.00]Is this just a color?
[08:22.95]Alright, well, first of all, hold on.
[08:25.75]I need to address something really important, because I don't want to get flack for this, because people are going to be very upset with me, and they're going to talk shit about me on the internet forums, and I have no way to defend myself.
[08:34.21]I can only defend myself when this stream is turned on.
[08:39.28]Think about that.
[08:40.10]If anyone says anything about me, you have to wait until my next livestream for me to repeat it.
[08:44.17]And try to fight for my case.
[08:48.13]Thank you for the 100 bucks.
[08:50.83]That's an insane amount of money.
[08:52.05]But more importantly, didn't lie about that.
[08:55.60]Told you I was going to play it off stream and decide if I wanted to play it or not because I thought it was a different video game than what was initially told to me by friends and family.
[09:02.54]But, glad you had a great time with the family, Jerma.
[09:04.60]Even if you did lie, I'm happy to see you back.
[09:06.36]And barely on time.
[09:07.56]Still on time.
[09:08.08]That's why I have the window.
[09:09.78]But thank you.
[09:10.26]What do you think?
[09:11.50]twitch.tv?
[09:12.17]No.
[09:14.67]What's my favorite color?
[09:15.53]Green.
[09:16.19]My favorite color is like in between here and here.
[09:17.65]Probably green.
[09:23.17]No, not the other one.
[09:25.51]That one belongs to you.
[09:29.05]I've been waiting for this for a long time.
[09:30.27]Some of you guys might not know this.
[09:31.95]Maybe you do.
[09:33.83]I've been waiting for this game to come out for a fucking century.
[09:35.95]Actually, that's almost true.
[09:37.77]Okay, press and hold.
[09:38.95]Okay.
[09:45.80]Yes, great Your imp responds to the smallest movements of your wireless control sound of your voice That's because it's attached to the controllers motions.
[09:56.45]Oh god.
[09:57.27]No only need to move the controller Okay, go on move your imp around a bit Think of the light.
[10:08.23]Okay.
[10:08.49]This sounds coming out of this as a flashlight beam conducting your imp
[10:14.73]Hopefully I can turn this off.
[10:18.97]Creativity clusters!
[10:20.03]Okay, I gotta like rest my hands down on my crotchial area.
[10:28.87]I don't want to drive a car.
[10:30.09]I don't know why people like this.
[10:33.40]I don't like holding my hands out like I'm driving a car.
[10:37.64]But when you drive a car, the wheel is big so you can rest your forearms on it.
[10:45.60]This is like driving a... Look, look, look.
[10:48.42]Motion controls are cool.
[10:51.56]Motion controls are interesting.
[10:54.75]But I don't like driving a car for more than four hours.
[10:56.99]I got it in one second.
[11:01.81]Watch this.
[11:02.09]Ready?
[11:18.85]I'm pretty good at it though.
[11:20.45]I'm pretty good at it and see if I get like all the doughnuts in one swoop ready It's a symphony
[11:35.22]What if this was the whole early access?
[11:36.56]That's it.
[11:36.86]Welcome to DREAM!
[11:37.66]I... played this game on iPad.
[11:40.28]What?
[11:40.58]Sweet!
[11:40.74]Excellent!
[11:41.26]Groovy!
[12:03.27]I wasn't doubting myself.
[12:04.85]I was completely confident.
[12:06.09]How do you grab?
[12:06.49]R2.
[12:06.57]That was pretty... That was pretty ingenuitive.
[12:08.61]Mm-hmm.
[12:26.47]That doesn't feel bad.
[12:27.19]Did we do it?
[12:28.79]Your idea.
[12:30.17]No, not my idea!
[12:30.86]Ah, shit.
[12:54.97]My idea was a Jack in the Box, apparently.
[12:59.11]Is it a loot box?
[13:00.97]No, it's not.
[13:01.53]Do I have to pay for ideas?
[13:04.39]Dude, the second we start paying for our imaginations, that's when the Illuminati government control has won.
[13:19.42]I'm just gonna be clear about that.
[13:29.53]This is cute, though.
[13:30.33]This is cute.
[13:31.49]Don't talk shit about this.
[13:33.81]Why did I pick green?
[13:37.93]I'm an idiot.
[13:39.05]Green is the symbol of intelligence.
[13:41.75]It's the color of intelligence.
[13:47.51]Dark.
[13:49.19]The only source of energy is you.
[13:54.00]What can you do?
[13:55.62]It's not the color of idiots.
[13:57.57]Go take color theory and you tell me.
[13:59.91]You can possess.
[14:03.25]Yellow is, like, anger.
[14:06.43]Red is, like, passion.
[14:07.67]Red is rage.
[14:09.20]Green is intelligence.
[14:10.40]Blue is calmness.
[14:14.88]Look it up.
[14:19.92]I just, like, smashed the lightbulb.
[14:24.22]one two three dream ah we have light a good start if only we had a way of exploring this place oh I'm gonna be a new character now we're really getting somewhere
[14:46.61]It's the X jumps.
[14:48.65]I don't... I'm confused.
[14:51.51]Oh, I get it.
[14:52.19]I get it, guys.
[14:52.71]I get it.
[14:53.67]Listen to me.
[14:54.69]Listen.
[14:55.23]Quiet.
[14:55.92]Stop talking.
[14:57.28]Stop talking.
[14:58.94]Listen.
[14:59.88]So, this whole thing was made in Dreams, yeah.
[15:03.06]Everything you're seeing here was made in this game.
[15:08.99]Okay, yeah.
[15:09.95]Brad.
[15:10.89]Brad.
[15:11.99]You and Mike have detention later, okay?
[15:15.69]After school, my office.
[15:19.15]Fucking assholes.
[15:21.47]There must be some way to get out there.
[15:26.01]This whole thing was made in dream.
[15:27.79]I know it says that in the lower right-hand corner.
[15:29.77]I know it does.
[15:30.43]So it was a springboard?
[15:32.00]You got it.
[15:38.54]Great work.
[15:40.12]We're so close.
[15:41.82]I can't wait to make my own video game.
[15:48.14]Cool.
[15:48.32]Okay, so circle is to interact.
[15:51.02]Well, circle is to get out, so how do I get in there?
[15:53.54]Oh, right, I have to use my hands.
[15:56.61]And then... Look at how shaky I am.
[16:07.56]Those of you who think I'm making this shit up, like how fucking weird I am and how fucked up I am, look at my hands!
[16:12.30]Alright, that's a rumble picture.
[16:15.46]It's a pretty good song, though.
[16:18.09]How is he moving?
[16:39.95]I need to pretend to jump too, though.
[16:41.09]Do you want me to play some music?
[16:42.37]You know, in 2020 hindsight, I should have brought a bed in here.
[16:44.76]And right when this turned on here, it said, dreams, let's start.
[16:47.46]I should have just got into bed.
[17:11.88]On camera.
[17:12.20]Oh well.
[17:13.96]Home space, okay.
[17:19.14]Interesting.
[17:19.44]Alright, so where do we go?
[17:22.28]What's this?
[17:22.92]A prize bubble!
[17:41.08]I have to collect the prize bubble.
[17:43.88]Well, I could find more.
[17:48.13]This is just... Okay, you've got the difficulty of a four-year-old Easter egg hunt here.
[17:52.85]I think I'll get them all.
[17:55.52]That was a staircase.
[18:00.98]Loot bubbles.
[18:07.50]What was that?
[18:08.44]Tic-tac-toe?
[18:10.15]How do I get that one?
[18:14.41]Of course it's got a name, like the Dreamiverse.
[18:18.29]Okay, where is it?
[18:20.69]Well, hold on.
[18:23.37]Hold on.
[18:23.89]Hold on, give me one second.
[18:27.63]Maybe I unlock a bigger jump?
[18:29.19]Like a super jump or something?
[18:30.67]Or a double jump?
[18:32.53]Yeah, I don't think I get any more.
[18:36.18]I think those are the predetermined ones that I'm allowed to get.
[18:37.86]Alright, main menu.
[18:39.98]So much to see.
[18:41.92]Decisions, decisions.
[18:43.32]Dream surfing.
[18:44.68]Choose dream surfing to experience other dreamers' creations.
[18:48.85]Okay.
[18:49.33]Or pop into dream shaping to make something of your own.
[18:51.91]Dream shaping or dream surfing?
[18:53.33]Should we check out what people have made first?
[18:58.48]Let's just see what's possible.
[19:02.01]Let's do some dreams here.
[19:03.83]I didn't get a chance to read that.
[19:04.91]Was that a disclaimer about it being like nudity or something?
[19:07.02]Or like R-rated material?
[19:08.32]I didn't get to see it.
[19:10.88]Ah, dream surfing.
[19:13.86]Here we can explore the wilds of the dreamiverse.
[19:18.24]Slipping and sliding through the strangest and most wonderful ideas and creations.
[19:23.81]I can't wait.
[19:24.29]This is going to be so cool.
[19:25.35]Lose yourself in the kaleidoscope of games, animations, music videos.
[19:31.50]You can do anything.
[19:32.08]And all sorts of worlds and experiences made by dreamers just like you.
[19:38.89]Dream Surfing is a never-ending, ever-changing stream of dreamers' imaginations.
[19:45.37]Let's try it out.
[19:46.07]I can't wait.
[19:47.87]I think some of you are underestimating how cool this game possibly could be.
[19:53.62]Final version art and voiceover added to the fun... Okay.
[19:57.16]Oh, I thought that... So this is just the... Version 1.01.
[20:02.32]Alright, let's go.
[20:05.31]Okay, dreams.
[20:07.19]Autosurf.
[20:07.77]Play through a randomly selected taster of the Dreamerverse.
[20:10.79]Um, what are you looking for?
[20:14.95]Game, story, showcase?
[20:17.64]Let's just do autosurf.
[20:23.42]Get the fastest time possible.
[20:31.81]That was a race?
[20:36.67]What the fuck?
[20:38.09]I don't understand what I have to do.
[20:43.69]This is really fast.
[20:45.09]Oh.
[20:45.21]No!
[20:45.48]I lose.
[20:46.12]It's like Super Mario Odyssey.
[21:06.88]Somebody's gonna make the entire Super Mario Odyssey in this game.
[21:11.74]Watch out!
[21:12.56]Alright, I got crushed.
[21:20.75]This is so cool!
[21:25.75]I won't make anything this cool.
[21:26.93]Shortcut, Mario Kart taught me this.
[21:28.92]Oh, wait, I have to jump up there.
[21:35.33]Can you imagine when talented people actually play this game?
[21:44.05]What?
[21:44.77]What was wrong?
[21:46.73]Oh, I went right to the middle.
[21:47.89]I thought I could go in there.
[21:51.75]See, I should be doing this like a speedrun.
[21:56.27]How is that possible?
[21:57.47]That's not even possible to do what I just did.
[22:02.37]That's not even possible.
[22:07.37]Oh my god, I'm just- I'm trying to do it like a speedrunner.
[22:31.60]Alright, that was cool.
[22:32.93]This is called Dreamer vs. Dad.
[22:34.41]I don't think that there are any actual created things here.
[22:39.79]Thumbs up or thumbs down?
[22:40.83]Rewind or skip?
[22:44.31]Uh, that was cute.
[22:45.30]I'll give it a thumbs up.
[22:47.78]And then let's go.
[22:48.66]Skip, right?
[22:56.04]What?
[22:56.28]Follow for up to... Okay, so this is a first-person shooter.
[23:00.38]aim shoot swap weapon reload crouch jump free aim uh okay
[23:31.77]Why does he look alive?
[23:32.59]I don't know, but I'm going to keep going.
[23:37.49]What's the goal?
[23:48.05]Is somebody hurting me?
[23:50.96]What is hurting me?
[23:52.72]Oh, Jesus.
[23:53.40]It's this guy.
[23:55.84]Okay, he has homing bullets.
[24:04.18]Same game made both of these.
[24:07.08]I can't wait to make my own.
[24:09.54]I'm gonna spend six months making my own thing.
[24:11.80]Remember I made the joke about painting the fences in the beginning of the stream?
[24:19.62]Hope you're ready for a fresh coat tomorrow!
[24:33.50]It's gonna run by I think I died I want to see more I
[25:02.08]Watch out, the gap in the door, it's a separate reality.
[25:04.26]The only me is you, are you sure the only you is you?
[25:07.00]What's that from?
[25:08.46]That's from something, in particular.
[25:13.55]This is P.T.!
[25:14.45]Somebody remade P.T.?
[25:16.87]No, they did not.
[25:17.55]Wait, no, that was it?
[25:22.87]Hold on, that was the end?
[25:24.87]I didn't get to do it?
[25:28.57]I didn't get to play P.T., it was just the first door.
[25:33.60]Please hug me, this is called.
[25:45.30]This is called curiosity.
[25:59.83]Curiosity.
[26:04.40]Thank you, Media Molecule, for this game.
[26:37.13]This is fucking unbelievable.
[26:45.95]I wonder how hard it is to use.
[26:53.92]It's a never-ending compilation of whatever anyone wants it to be.
[26:57.94]Holy shit.
[27:09.27]I can run?
[27:10.59]Can I?
[27:10.89]I don't think I can run.
[27:12.01]I think I just have to get there.
[27:16.30]Oops.
[27:22.39]So it's like a game engine that anyone can use.
[27:26.37]Yeah, but you don't have to make a game.
[27:29.81]You can do anything.
[27:30.89]You can paint a picture.
[27:32.19]You can make an animation.
[27:33.53]You can make a little cartoon.
[27:35.99]You can make a 2D cartoon.
[27:37.74]I'm pretty sure there's no limit to it having to be a video game.
[27:43.74]I think I ran into an invisible wall.
[27:48.56]Uh-oh.
[27:51.08]Uh, this one doesn't seem to be done.
[27:56.59]Oh, I have to go... Wait, did I do the wrong thing?
[28:02.32]Should I have gone around another way?
[28:07.94]Was I supposed to go up the mountain?
[28:09.84]Maybe.
[28:14.28]Jeremy lied about Minecraft VR thanks to the five community subs.
[28:17.29]Thank you.
[28:18.75]Appreciate it.
[28:21.17]Five more from Jeremy lied about Minecraft VR.
[28:24.21]Am I gonna run into another wall here?
[28:30.23]Keep lying.
[28:30.97]It's how most of us stay subscribed.
[28:32.77]But what happens when I get here?
[28:38.88]I gotta see the whole thing through, right?
[28:42.48]I can't just go this far without touching the beam.
[28:44.22]That would be a mistake.
[28:50.60]Alright, you ready for my dramatic cry moment?
[28:55.36]I'm gonna get there and I'm gonna power off before I touch it.
[28:57.85]Or another battery or something.
[28:59.73]That's what I would've done.
[29:08.21]Made it.
[29:16.74]The journey is never completed.
[29:23.46]Ah, shit.
[29:24.04]Well, I didn't have to do that whole thing.
[29:27.30]Well, that's the end of that one.
[29:32.29]Alright, this is called Loop 1.
[29:34.45]Wait, why is it... Why?
[29:38.31]It's just that this is a different screen.
[29:44.55]We got the rope.
[29:45.54]Was that part of the same game?
[29:54.58]The day of the crime, the father went to the trunk of his car, retrieved the rifle, and shot his wife.
[29:59.90]There's a PT playlist, and it just happens to be looping them in here.
[30:03.48]When his 10-year-old son came to investigate the commotion, the father shot him, too.
[30:07.25]His 6-year-old daughter had the good sense to hide in the bathroom, but reports suggest he lured her out by telling her it was just a game.
[30:16.23]The girl was found shot once in the chest from point-blank range.
[30:20.33]The mother, who he shot in the stomach, was pregnant at the time.
[30:24.74]Kids game.
[30:24.96]I don't know if it's a kids game.
[30:26.20]It's an anything game.
[30:27.02]The off-road lands.
[30:27.44]Chapter 1.
[30:27.66]We're getting a bunch of random things.
[30:28.82]We should be getting them... This is overwhelming how cool this is.
[30:31.39]Oh, it's me.
[30:55.94]Well, it gets into the letter grade because there's cars.
[30:57.86]Oh my god, I'm gonna make a car game.
[30:59.49]I can't wait to make a car game.
[31:04.56]It's coming through.
[31:05.16]Someone just flushed a toilet.
[31:23.17]I can't wait to make something.
[31:25.12]But I don't want to jump into it yet.
[31:26.30]I want to see more creation.
[31:32.36]Wow.
[31:36.24]I win.
[31:36.52]Back to Majora's Menu.
[31:41.69]Galactic Adventures.
[31:43.39]Press X to start.
[32:00.10]It's... No, what's happening is it's giving me random... There can't be that many to pull from right now because it's only been a week.
[32:11.92]That's so funny.
[32:21.16]His six-year-old daughter had the good sense to hide in the bathroom, but reports suggest he lured her out by telling her it was just a game.
[32:28.55]The girl was found shot once in the chest from point-blank range.
[32:32.91]Don't touch that dial now, we're just getting started.
[32:36.05]Because here comes the off-road lens chapter two.
[32:45.53]So this is chapter two.
[32:46.65]So each level has to be its own loading area.
[32:57.15]I can't wait to see how this connects to the PT universe.
[33:21.84]The game is way too loud.
[33:23.96]I'll fix that.
[33:25.98]Am I just rolling down the hill?
[33:37.65]What the fuck?
[33:43.45]I don't think that was supposed to happen.
[33:50.94]How am I supposed to get out of here?
[33:53.18]Oh.
[33:54.36]I beat it.
[33:58.31]Space Pilot Dogfight.
[33:59.91]There's this one.
[34:03.37]Holy shit.
[34:04.25]Cockpit, you take off?
[34:08.89]What?!
[34:14.90]Wow!
[34:15.48]This is unbelievable.
[34:18.78]Alright, quick.
[34:19.22]Somebody make Star Fox 2.
[34:25.26]How do I lock on?
[34:35.93]What was the lock on?
[34:36.79]Was it a circle?
[34:38.27]What does the enemy lock on?
[34:38.97]Who the hell is it locked on to?
[34:40.09]I want this one.
[34:53.17]How do I do, like, a flip roll?
[35:12.90]Too late.
[35:18.13]Doesn't she show up?
[35:18.91]Don't you have to zoom in and look at stuff?
[35:22.83]I hear them calling to me from...
[35:31.58]When his 10-year-old son came to investigate the commotion, the father shot him too.
[35:36.35]His 6-year-old daughter had the good sense to hide in the bathroom.
[35:40.61]Reports suggest he lured her out by telling her it was just a game.
[35:45.01]The girl was found shot once in the chest from point-blank range.
[35:49.15]The mother, who he shot in the stomach, was pregnant at the time.
[35:53.60]Police arriving on scene after neighbors called 911 found the father in his car listening to the radio.
[36:00.66]Yeah, didn't she hang out in the corner or something?
[36:07.78]I can't believe somebody made the whole game here.
[36:13.58]Hey, here we go.
[36:15.64]Let's go to the new Chapter 3 of the Off-Road Lens.
[36:18.36]Mine's gonna be up here.
[36:24.31]I'm gonna make, like, the Temple of the Lost Ark or something.
[36:28.05]What?
[36:31.19]Oh.
[36:37.31]Okay, giant sword.
[36:45.63]Look at this shit.
[36:56.00]This can't be that difficult to do though, because that was the whole purpose of this game.
[37:01.18]They spent a decade trying to make this game completely accessible and incredibly deep at the same time.
[37:15.75]Watch us go there, it is insanely hard to use.
[37:19.09]No, no way!
[37:22.55]So easy a streamer could do it, that's true.
[37:26.83]Hammer of Panic, two-player minigame.
[37:33.21]Hammer Panic?
[37:35.91]What is this?
[37:37.03]Okay, so you're a little hammer guy.
[37:38.47]Doesn't this look like a TV show or a cartoon?
[37:45.00]Hit objects and your opponent's colored bite bulbs to score points.
[38:03.26]And you can jump in this, too.
[38:07.58]Hit the objects into your opponent's backboard.
[38:13.68]Okay, so it's like a game of soccer.
[38:16.91]I can't even win with nobody fighting me.
[38:24.95]Ah, I see.
[38:25.33]They have weight, too.
[38:26.69]It's beautiful, too.
[38:27.71]The graphics are really nice.
[38:31.98]Make your opponent fall off.
[38:41.06]Oh, I remember playing this in Minecraft!
[38:43.35]What's this called in Minecraft?
[38:46.13]It's called, like, Quiplo or something?
[38:48.67]What's it called?
[38:50.51]Spleef!
[38:51.53]That's Quiplash.
[38:52.71]Spleef!
[39:04.67]Final results.
[39:05.85]Winner!
[39:11.56]End game.
[39:11.90]So you can make a little Mario Party.
[39:19.52]Here comes the bathroom loop.
[39:36.20]Goddammit.
[39:39.22]I didn't want to play a horror game right now.
[39:43.58]Wait, what?
[40:24.00]I'm not doing this one.
[40:25.66]No.
[40:29.15]Final chapter of the off-road lands.
[40:35.45]Yeah, it's truly off-road.
[40:36.55]It's off the cliff.
[40:47.93]Well, this is not a boat, this is a car.
[40:57.06]Car's still running.
[40:58.02]I'm gonna make a city.
[41:00.84]I'm gonna make GTA 6.
[41:01.68]Um... What is...
[41:23.71]That's pretty, uh, scary.
[41:27.97]What does that imply?
[41:29.63]What?
[41:29.79]No fucking way!
[41:31.41]They're gonna get sued!
[41:33.69]So many people are gonna get sued.
[41:55.33]Don't sue me, though.
[41:56.09]I didn't do it.
[41:56.55]I'm just showcasing it.
[41:59.95]You can't get sued for, like, reporting the news, right?
[42:01.89]Like, I'm just reporting the news.
[42:04.09]What do I mean wrong?
[42:10.44]Get the 1 up?
[42:10.78]I don't even remember how to do this.
[42:12.64]I don't... Guys, I haven't played Mario 1 1 since that was, like, 7.
[42:17.40]Which one is it?
[42:17.90]It's under here, right?
[42:19.72]Where is it?
[42:20.00]It's right here?
[42:22.38]It's... I know it's right here somewhere.
[42:33.28]Where is it?
[42:33.82]No, they didn't put that in here.
[42:37.96]They didn't program that in.
[42:39.00]I can't run fast?
[42:44.61]No.
[42:48.23]What about going down?
[42:58.07]Oh, fuck.
[42:58.87]Oh, well.
[42:59.45]I'll get the... Oh.
[43:00.09]Never mind.
[43:00.81]This is gonna be... This is gonna be a one... Uh, I don't think it knows what to do.
[43:13.09]Oh, Super Mario 1-1 was really fun.
[43:20.84]This is... This is, like...
[43:26.40]Look behind glitch.
[43:27.74]I already did.
[43:55.88]Dark Souls inspired Dark Dungeon.
[43:58.50]Inspired by Dark Souls.
[44:03.96]So this is not a game.
[44:05.18]This is going to be just a piece of video.
[44:36.87]I can't wait for Jerma to die to Pinwheel later in this game.
[44:54.02]This is called Main Menu.
[44:55.70]Press X to rock.
[44:58.64]So, each screen is its own piece of media.
[45:05.60]I want to rock so bad.
[45:10.76]Different colored notes will approach this guitar hero.
[45:12.68]Alright, let's play it.
[45:21.71]Don't touch that dial now, we're just getting started.
[45:25.03]Let's play Rock On!
[45:27.59]What?
[45:29.93]Release the game for free and find someone who matches the...
[45:34.45]What the fuck was that?
[45:44.24]That was a messed up loading screen.
[45:47.50]That was actually kind of scary.
[45:49.20]Is this a skateboard?
[45:52.46]Holy shit.
[45:53.20]How do I steer it?
[45:55.30]I don't think I can steer this.
[46:02.36]Oh god!
[46:12.93]It's too hard to stay on.
[46:19.93]I can't stay on this.
[46:32.83]Where's the camera?
[46:34.79]I don't know if I'm still on it.
[46:35.76]Am I still on it?
[46:40.10]Yes, I still am.
[46:42.97]That was pretty cool.
[46:48.05]Are you gonna make a roller coaster or something?
[46:50.75]There are too many ideas flying around in my head at the same time.
[46:57.32]Whoa!
[46:57.60]Oh no!
[46:59.60]Holy shit, I actually got back on.
[47:19.06]Is the whole level coming down?
[47:20.42]I can't go off.
[47:25.49]I'm going off sideways.
[47:27.79]This is not how a skateboard works.
[47:34.14]Just drifting off.
[47:36.06]Song list.
[47:36.86]I need to get out of here.
[47:39.20]And do an actual play.
[47:41.06]Newsletter Blues.
[47:43.12]Taking sizable sips from the Creek of Anguish.
[47:46.49]Yeah.
[48:01.55]A Life Took Lemons game.
[48:03.39]Slayer Scrolls, scene 0.5, title card.
[48:05.89]You are a Slayer.
[48:07.54]You take on contracts called Scrolls to slay men or beasts in exchange for gold.
[48:13.38]You have journeyed to the quaint Stonewall town.
[48:17.20]You enter the Dwarf Inn.
[48:18.42]The innkeeper here is especially adept at finding the best Scrolls offering the most gold.
[48:25.12]Slayer Scrolls.
[48:30.16]I want to go to that.
[48:53.51]Am I getting booed?
[48:56.57]I forget what it is.
[49:08.04]It's not even the real game and it's still scary!
[49:17.30]This is not even the right one!
[49:24.07]This is a pretend version and it's still just as bad.
[49:26.61]Here we go!
[49:36.64]Button prompts.
[49:38.20]Slide.
[49:40.30]Run is L1?
[49:59.76]Am I fucking Grover?
[50:04.42]Oh, yes.
[50:05.96]I think I will take two scrolls.
[50:15.61]Welcome to the Dwarf Inn, Slayer.
[50:19.25]Do you have a scroll for me?
[50:21.85]Always do, but before we get started, you should know there is an assassin here for you.
[50:29.22]An assassin?
[50:30.02]Why did you let him in?
[50:32.62]He's got gold for ale, just like anyone else.
[50:35.42]But a dead Slayer in my inn is not good for business.
[50:39.56]I'll take care of it.
[50:40.34]Which one is he?
[50:41.86]He's the fat one.
[50:42.88]Hard to miss the lad.
[50:44.58]Remember, Slayer, no weapons in my inn.
[50:47.60]And keep it quiet.
[50:49.18]A bar fight is not good for business.
[50:55.32]I know I did mention the word Grover.
[50:56.98]That's the guy that Grover always pisses off.
[51:01.17]That's the guy that goes to all of Grover's restaurants and he fucks up his order every time.
[51:06.92]No, I wanted to have a slice of pizza.
[51:09.94]It's that guy.
[51:12.24]No, I wanted... I didn't want spaghetti and meatballs.
[51:16.76]I wanted a pizza.
[51:20.81]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[51:27.17]Where's the fat one?
[51:30.35]Oh, that guy.
[51:30.93]That's the fat one, I think.
[51:37.27]Is a guy fat or is he just a pear?
[51:44.04]Fill the assassin's drink with something deadly.
[51:51.12]Is that another prompt?
[51:54.08]Dead?
[51:55.06]What is it saying?
[51:55.94]I can't read that.
[52:05.15]Fill the- Is it dead?
[52:07.11]Does it say dead?
[52:12.53]Why would they have a bucket of poison in here?
[52:15.96]Dip in sludge.
[52:20.28]Here you go.
[52:27.50]Wait, there's two fat guys.
[52:28.65]No, there's not.
[52:29.91]Okay, here he is.
[52:30.97]Here you go.
[52:47.08]He's asleep.
[52:48.99]Okay, I did it, right?
[52:49.83]Do I win?
[53:02.69]I can't wait to do that.
[53:04.57]After we get jumpscared again by P.T.
[53:42.57]I think I just leave.
[53:44.28]Leave Dwarf in.
[53:47.16]Oh, god damn it.
[53:48.08]Um... Thank god we got the Slayer Scrolls scene, too.
[54:21.07]This is actually really, really cool looking.
[54:26.47]I think they had to sculpt these people, too.
[54:28.71]Do I have to go fight the dragon?
[54:36.15]Is there a sprint?
[54:36.89]Yeah, right here.
[54:44.01]Giant snowmen.
[54:44.95]I don't have a sword, though.
[54:47.32]Swing sword.
[54:48.08]I don't have one.
[54:55.84]I can't wait for the 3D Undertale to be made in this, you know what I'm saying?
[55:00.92]Alright, let's go out the door.
[55:08.58]It already exists?
[55:09.74]You've got to be kidding me.
[55:12.14]I think there already is one.
[55:13.26]Well, great.
[55:14.28]Will they let me out?
[55:25.77]Where do I get one of those?
[55:26.57]Oh.
[55:27.60]Oh.
[55:32.42]I should get this one.
[55:33.07]This one should be pretty easy.
[56:20.19]How does one even make this in this game though?
[56:44.96]I need to think of what I want to make.
[56:46.70]We're going to go with like three or four dog shit things.
[56:50.92]And then I'm going to get the real idea that I'm going to spend the next six months on.
[57:03.74]Make the Grover pizza thing.
[57:06.30]You want me to make the scene from Sesame Street where Grover fucks up the Muppets food.
[57:11.64]That's what you want me to do.
[57:16.34]Do you want me to spend at least three to four streams on this?
[57:20.68]Do it.
[57:21.96]But without the voices it doesn't make- I have to do text!
[57:48.62]I'm gonna have to get a transcript of that scene from Sesame Street.
[57:52.42]This is a long song.
[57:53.46]How long does this last?
[57:55.14]100,000 points.
[57:55.52]One, two, three, four, five stars.
[57:58.51]Aww.
[58:15.52]That's alright.
[58:15.86]That's a restaurant worth going to on Yelp.
[58:17.80]Yelp is fucking tough.
[58:18.84]It's really hard.
[58:21.74]How many times do I have to keep doing this one?
[58:25.84]Did I not do the completion thing to not have to do this one?
[58:34.35]I think this is where the... Whoever's making this, I think this is where they left off.
[58:45.05]Slayer scroll scene 2.5.
[58:48.00]After days of journey, you arrive at the northern mountains.
[58:50.64]As you climb the mountain, you reach a clearing.
[58:53.26]A dwarf waits here, an axe in his hand, and a slain man below him.
[59:00.53]I don't want to do any more of these songs.
[59:14.79]Okay, listen up and don't you move.
[59:18.28]If you take a piss, hold it.
[59:21.42]Imagine we actually got this game.
[59:54.94]Here we go Wait is that that's my sword?
[60:08.57]My sword is very clearly a leg I just do a sidewards kick
[60:20.83]Welcome to Studge's Mountain.
[60:22.66]To continue on your journey, you must pay Studge's toll.
[60:26.16]Any questions?
[60:27.48]A warning!
[60:28.48]You'll get the same answer as the poor sod below me.
[60:31.78]Fight!
[60:32.28]Lie!
[60:32.72]Charm!
[60:33.22]Intimidate!
[60:34.75]You picked the wrong guy to rob.
[60:36.05]I already paid the tax when I came by earlier.
[60:39.51]How does a handsome dwarf like you end up here?
[60:41.81]Make way for a slave before I make you dragon feed.
[60:46.76]Why, mister, you ain't too bad looking yourself as to why I'm here.
[60:50.90]It all started when I was nine.
[60:54.12]Lost my parents in a mining accident.
[60:56.40]Growing up on the streets of Dwarf Hold made me angry man and a deadly one.
[61:01.41]Well, thanks for listening to this dwarf's tale.
[61:03.47]Go on your way now and let me ponder my ways.
[61:09.19]Why did I get a... Why am I red now?
[61:17.47]Oh, there we go.
[61:21.16]They're dead?
[61:23.62]Let's go!
[61:24.90]Fight the dragon!
[61:49.84]No.
[61:54.60]I gotta make something fucking wild.
[61:56.14]Skip it.
[61:57.18]No, I can't skip it yet.
[62:18.58]Oh, God.
[62:19.16]Wait.
[62:20.24]What?
[62:22.24]Wait, it didn't even give me a chance to... The day of the crime, the father went to the trunk of his car, retrieved the rifle, and shot his wife...
[62:46.47]Oh, goddammit.
[62:47.27]Do I have to actually do something here?
[62:51.63]Isn't it with the clock?
[62:52.49]Hello.
[62:53.09]Yeah, R3 doesn't zoom in anymore.
[62:54.61]Thanks.
[62:54.79]Oh.
[62:54.98]Uh...
[63:16.02]When his ten-year-old son came to investigate the commotion, the father shot him, too.
[63:21.41]His six-year-old daughter had the good chance to hide in the... Don't.
[63:24.01]Don't press X. I think I did it.
[63:25.43]No, I didn't.
[63:25.95]What other shit do I have to press?
[63:33.60]Don't you have to find, like, photos?
[63:51.55]Yeah, I'm... When his 10-year-old son came to investigate the commotion, the father... The six-year-old daughter had the good sense to hide in the bathroom, but reports suggest he lured her out by telling her it was just a game.
[64:09.26]The girl was found shot once in the chest from point-blank range.
[64:14.06]The mother, who he shot in the stomach, was pregnant at the time.
[64:18.50]Police arriving on scene after neighbors called 911 found the father in his car, listening to the radio.
[64:25.58]Several days before the murders, neighbors say they heard the father repeating a sequence of numbers in a loud voice.
[64:32.15]They said it was like he was chanting some strange spell.
[64:36.97]There was a...
[64:44.89]If you reach a valley on the mountainside, the smell of smoke and ash fills your lungs.
[64:49.60]The presence of fire would be comfort for your cold hands, if it did not signal that a dragon is stirring.
[64:56.54]The piercing screech of a dragon causes you to slip off a cliff and drop your sword.
[65:01.24]Oi, what you looking at is the name of this.
[65:18.12]Oh, it's the gyro to lean.
[65:20.14]This is fucking stupid.
[65:21.62]The following is an early visual concept created on Dreams.
[65:25.48]Metro.
[65:51.16]cinematic camera real-time footage running on the bubble bath engine that's what this is called the bubble bath engine I don't think there's anything else here I think it's just a little concept follow more follow for more content I'm not following anybody
[66:21.77]I cannot move.
[66:23.80]This is just a static representation of what they're developing at the moment.
[66:33.52]Oi, you.
[66:34.30]What you looking at?
[66:35.24]What you looking at?
[66:36.27]Oi.
[66:36.35]Alright.
[66:44.25]Well, that's cool.
[66:49.57]Here we go.
[66:49.97]Dragon boss fight.
[66:52.37]Wait, this is the... Holy shit.
[66:55.98]Oh my god, I can't wait.
[66:59.04]This is the ending of Slayer Scrolls.
[67:06.98]This is... Okay, you know when you're watching TV on the couch, and there's three or four shows on at the same time that you want to watch?
[67:15.63]This is just channel surfing back and forth between those channels.
[67:19.87]It's like, oh, I really want to see who gets chopped next, but I also want to see what happens to Garfield.
[67:27.34]This goes to commercial and you change to the other show.
[67:31.96]What down are the Patriots right now?
[67:33.51]Let's go find out.
[67:39.39]What was that?
[67:41.11]Take Apple.
[67:49.13]Haha!
[67:50.09]Oh, he's gonna burn the forest down!
[67:54.61]What do I do?
[67:55.19]How do I kill him?
[67:56.47]I only have a sword!
[67:57.23]He's got a thousand health!
[68:27.96]I got him!
[68:31.22]Where are you going?
[68:34.66]Where am I going?
[68:38.82]What is he doing?
[68:46.41]I got it!
[68:47.35]Take the dragon tooth!
[68:48.35]I completed the game!
[68:58.34]Ah, this is the... Are you kidding me?
[69:07.10]Look at this scoffing job.
[69:08.92]This is so cool.
[69:23.05]This really is a dream version of this level.
[69:35.12]Anything else I can do?
[69:37.80]Can I open any doors?
[69:46.17]I think these are all different ways to go, and we'll do a new screen?
[69:53.09]Book of the Dragon!
[69:59.40]Uh...
[70:09.21]Dude, this is so cool!
[70:32.29]What needs to be connected here?
[70:33.31]Alva blue.
[70:37.18]That's it, right?
[70:39.28]No, something's wrong there.
[70:40.20]I don't know, I can't read this.
[70:45.95]What does it say?
[71:12.87]You've carried the Dragon's Tooth and made- was that part of the Book of Dragons?
[71:18.45]When you arrive, the gates don't open for you like usual.
[71:21.39]Guards come outside to confront you.
[71:24.19]They don't look too pleased to see you.
[71:33.49]The portal demo?
[71:37.81]Face direction of portal.
[71:39.67]Maintain current direction.
[71:41.25]Uncap velocity.
[71:42.19]Cap velocity.
[71:51.41]Is it supposed to be a portal gun?
[71:58.08]Oh, okay.
[71:58.70]R1.
[71:58.98]And...
[72:06.45]So it works.
[72:07.99]It technically works.
[72:15.39]It's these little pancakes.
[72:17.46]Okay, so let's go like this.
[72:30.04]I'm not sure there is a win condition here.
[72:32.22]It looks like a test.
[72:45.32]Do a loop?
[72:47.94]Alright, I'll do a loop.
[72:54.24]No, no, get in there.
[73:06.77]Oh wait, I can do it?
[73:07.61]Right, it's portal.
[73:08.85]You can just do a loop.
[73:10.09]Like this.
[73:19.85]Wait, what?
[73:21.03]Can I not do a loop?
[73:30.97]Yeah, I can't do it on the ceiling.
[73:32.35]I'm trying just to fall through.
[73:33.37]No, I- oh, oh.
[73:44.25]I'm not sure this is gonna work.
[74:00.32]That's enough of that.
[74:02.08]PlayStation Home Studio.
[74:09.23]Side table?
[74:16.05]Sit.
[74:20.84]Didn't they turn PlayStation Home off completely forever?
[74:30.36]This is cool.
[74:31.22]You can just make this.
[74:36.66]Oh, you can actually move things around.
[74:40.25]Interesting.
[74:44.05]So you can make your own little apartment.
[74:45.67]Cool.
[74:47.17]Alright, we'll do a few... We have to finish Slayer Scrolls.
[74:52.16]You're no longer allowed inside Stonewall Town.
[74:54.46]What foolishness is this?
[74:55.39]I've been traveling to Stonewall for ages.
[74:57.83]A fortnight ago, a Slayer burned Icevale Village to the ground.
[75:01.53]Every man, woman, and child were slain.
[75:04.01]Slayers are no longer allowed in Stonewall.
[75:11.86]Stonewall is a beautiful village.
[75:12.98]I would never bring harm to it.
[75:14.32]I'm not a Slayer.
[75:15.08]You can't judge me on the actions of others.
[75:19.98]Cuphead.
[75:20.34]Dreams Edition.
[75:20.90]What?
[75:21.14]Are you serious?
[75:21.60]How do I shoot?
[75:51.16]What does that mean?
[75:52.40]Kill it!
[75:52.68]Kill them!
[76:34.94]Takes a lot of hits.
[76:42.15]DIE!
[76:43.91]Alright, I need to get the coins.
[76:50.19]Wait, you can dash.
[76:50.85]You can jump and dash, right?
[77:05.66]Anybody else?
[77:06.30]Where is he?
[77:15.97]Oh, it's the Dysphoria level.
[77:24.82]Die!
[77:25.92]That's too many hits!
[77:27.44]I'm shooting him a million times!
[77:36.23]Alright, where's the end?
[77:42.20]I see a heart over there.
[77:44.18]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[77:48.68]Oh, there it is.
[77:51.84]He's too short, I can't hit him.
[78:07.20]Oh, this is bad.
[78:08.20]Uh-huh.
[78:08.96]Ah, shit.
[78:09.39]Too many.
[78:09.97]Pop the squat.
[78:10.77]Yeah, that's right.
[78:11.71]You have to collect all coins?
[78:33.58]Oh, did you actually just hit me?
[78:38.66]Alright, I don't know if there's an end.
[78:50.09]This is really, really cool, though.
[78:51.45]I think I'm gonna have to just collect everything.
[78:56.09]That's awesome.
[78:57.11]You know what, I'll give that one a thumbs up.
[79:00.55]They had to make Cuphead.
[79:03.96]It's called The Encounter.
[79:06.42]Disclaimer.
[79:06.80]The following level is a demo for an upcoming project planned for production after the release of Dreams.
[79:10.25]It's currently being worked on, so you might experience minor bugs or glitches.
[79:12.85]Enjoy.
[79:15.77]Okay.
[79:25.56]Big Surf 77 presents... Chapter 1.
[79:26.86]The Encounter.
[79:48.03]It looks like a space station base of some sort, right?
[79:58.72]Do I have any guns or anything?
[80:03.42]I don't think so.
[80:05.28]Oh, there you are!
[80:05.88]Yeah?
[80:12.13]I think it's time to finally leave this space station.
[80:14.92]Oh, that's nice.
[80:19.18]Oh, fuck, I forgot it's a robot in a video game after the, like, 2012.
[80:23.42]Something weird is going on.
[80:24.48]We better hurry.
[80:25.04]Okay.
[80:34.11]Okay.
[80:43.59]Hold on, I'll open the door for you.
[80:57.47]The password was olympicbanana.
[80:58.89]What a weird password.
[81:01.55]So it's just me and you, huh?
[81:05.46]He was doing hunt and peck.
[81:07.14]What's wrong with that?
[81:07.86]There's nothing wrong with that.
[81:17.29]Open it manually in the control room.
[81:28.52]Control room's on the left.
[81:29.98]Okay, what about over here, anything?
[81:34.26]This is pretty well made.
[81:37.55]Can I do this?
[81:52.33]There we are, the control room.
[82:01.44]Hmm, I don't remember that there were that many buttons.
[82:04.72]So press the button that activates what?
[82:08.44]This?
[82:12.39]Let's see.
[82:12.95]It can't be that difficult, right?
[82:14.19]Oh, well, is this a job for you or a job for me?
[82:17.19]Who does this?
[82:21.48]This is your sub sound.
[82:28.10]It kind of is.
[82:28.66]Alright, we'll press it.
[82:42.43]Well, it's my fault.
[82:43.07]There's gonna be a monster right here when he turns the lights on.
[82:45.41]It's gonna be scary.
[82:46.65]Watch this.
[82:47.63]Told you.
[82:48.65]Lights go on.
[82:53.70]Nooo, unfortunate.
[82:57.19]At least the door is open now, I guess.
[83:02.25]Anyway, let's hurry.
[83:07.54]How- do you- okay, let me ask you guys a question.
[83:09.82]How much money do you think I could make if I just did that?
[83:12.92]Like this.
[83:17.88]If I was- if I was Cute Robot in Horror Game, do you think I'd make some money?
[83:24.31]Do you think I would get... Do you think anyone would want that?
[83:26.49]I mean, it would clearly just be a guy going like... But would it be cute?
[83:35.68]It might be.
[83:36.08]Is this open?
[83:46.45]Can I look through there?
[83:54.05]Between $4 and $15.
[83:59.85]That's not very much.
[84:00.74]Here we go.
[84:11.15]That's the ship.
[84:11.61]Let us get out of here.
[84:19.49]Well, it's not called The Encounter because nothing... The playable demo ends here, but I will be updated soon.
[84:27.21]Oh, it is... So it is the end.
[84:32.29]Carrot7, thanks for the five community subs.
[84:37.13]Thank you, Carrot7.
[84:37.67]So... This is just a demo of what's coming.
[84:45.08]I mean, this is a pretty well-made space station.
[84:49.33]It really was.
[84:49.83]You know, come on, we gotta... I gotta rate these.
[84:57.90]Um... Hello?
[85:00.18]Why can I not move?
[85:02.76]That was good.
[85:06.50]Here we go.
[85:07.18]Slayer scene sick.
[85:08.43]There's so many of these.
[85:09.93]Eat apple swing sword.
[85:11.33]Uh... Dwarf orders no slayers allowed in the inn.
[85:20.23]Everyone is afraid of slayers, ever since that lunatic burned an entire village.
[85:26.73]The dwarf says having you inside his inn is not good for business.
[85:33.31]What do I do now?
[85:34.09]I have a scroll to complete.
[85:37.31]If you ask me, you should win back the favor of this town.
[85:42.34]There's plenty of people here who could use your help.
[85:46.76]If the people like you, the dwarf would have no reason to keep you out.
[85:52.33]I have a feeling that this is very long.
[85:58.05]This one is a real passionate person.
[86:02.80]That has 40 or 50 different screens here.
[86:07.90]Town favor is 0 out of 5.
[86:09.36]Can I talk to townspeople?
[86:18.25]Oh, they have quest markers.
[86:25.59]That's the How to Train Your Dragon guy.
[86:26.87]Alright, I've never seen How to Train Your Dragon before.
[86:33.24]Any of the movies.
[86:34.62]But every trailer I ever watched, I was always curious.
[86:38.04]And someone explain to me maybe if it makes sense or not.
[86:40.56]I don't know, I just didn't get it.
[86:43.11]Why is the main character talk like this?
[86:46.67]Is there a reason for that?
[86:49.06]I don't know.
[86:52.88]The rest of the cast is like this, and they're talking.
[86:55.54]Oh, my friend, you can't be serious.
[86:58.66]Well, you know, it's just me, the main character.
[87:00.43]Is there a reason why that is?
[87:05.05]I just, I didn't know.
[87:06.09]I thought, was there some reason for it?
[87:17.99]is to make him out of place.
[87:23.61]Oh.
[87:24.21]Yeah, I just didn't know if he was from a different land or something.
[87:29.37]Because he's a pathetic, weak dweeb like you.
[87:33.93]What?
[87:34.47]I don't talk like... I don't talk like that!
[87:39.82]Do I talk like this?
[87:41.78]No, I talk like this!
[87:42.84]I have a strong voice!
[87:45.36]A powerful voice!
[87:47.27]A voice that commands.
[87:48.53]A voice that demands.
[87:50.07]You know what I'm saying?
[87:52.17]My voice is strong.
[87:58.22]Hey there, Mr. Slayer.
[87:58.98]Slayers are brave, aren't they?
[87:59.94]Yes, we are.
[88:00.42]What's going on with my internet?
[88:01.70]Come on, man.
[88:06.92]I wish I was brave, but since you are, can you help me do something brave?
[88:13.58]Get on with it.
[88:14.06]I don't have all day.
[88:15.12]I'm ready to help, sure.
[88:15.78]What do you need?
[88:18.28]I want you to tell this girl that I like her.
[88:21.07]She's easy to find.
[88:22.59]She's the prettiest of them all.
[88:29.31]How is this... I'll tell her, but you have to be more specific.
[88:34.67]Fine, but all you peasants dress the same and look the same to me.
[88:37.85]You're gonna have to be more specific.
[88:41.54]She's playing by the other snowman.
[88:45.20]Alright.
[88:48.63]Okay, Toothless.
[88:50.49]Let's go find ourselves an adventure to go on, Toothless.
[88:54.08]Where's the other snowman?
[89:10.30]That's not her, right?
[89:12.26]Where's the other snowman?
[89:14.02]No, you have a quest marker.
[89:15.10]There's too many quest markers!
[89:16.20]I need to focus!
[89:23.09]Other snowman.
[89:29.35]The lady with the pretzel?
[89:30.84]The lady with the yogurt dip pretzel?
[89:33.40]No, I don't think so.
[89:47.61]Where's this other snowman?
[89:51.94]Skip this one.
[89:52.96]No!
[89:56.08]That was a gunshot!
[89:59.67]Someone just shot a rifle.
[90:10.94]This is gonna take forever.
[90:12.06]Just hold on.
[90:13.58]Just wait, wait, wait.
[90:14.26]There it is.
[90:14.56]There, there, there, there.
[90:19.72]You haven't even completed one out of five.
[90:21.23]They're all going to be very quick.
[90:30.45]Oh, I like him too.
[90:31.42]Thank you for telling me.
[90:36.84]You have another mission to do?
[90:39.34]Is she going over there?
[91:03.60]This feels really weird being a fucking adult here.
[91:08.28]You know what?
[91:08.90]I don't... I don't wanna like be over here.
[91:10.76]Alright, I'm gonna go this way.
[91:23.14]Oh, you two like each other?
[91:24.36]That's cool!
[91:24.84]I'm just gonna sit here and stay and just watch.
[91:26.82]Get out of here, dude.
[91:28.04]Fuck off.
[91:30.26]What is this guy?
[91:32.44]Hey there, buddy!
[91:33.64]You look like someone who can help me.
[91:36.84]I left a valuable on the roof of my house.
[91:39.20]Can you grab it?
[91:44.68]You got it up there, you can get it down.
[91:46.86]How do I get up there?
[91:50.82]I appreciate your help, Slayer.
[91:55.37]Is this your house?
[92:02.13]Yeah, I just... That's right, that's right.
[92:04.45]I just killed a dragon.
[92:07.66]And instead of being led into the village, I have to play matchmaker for, like, eight-year-olds.
[92:14.04]And get a frisbee off of a roof.
[92:21.18]Can't make this?
[92:23.30]Oh, right here.
[92:30.09]I can't skip this one, guys.
[92:31.47]Don't you understand?
[92:32.17]I can't.
[92:37.19]Shit.
[92:38.01]How do I crouch?
[92:45.96]What is wrong with your house?
[92:47.36]God damn it!
[92:51.80]Why would you build it like this?
[92:56.84]Why would this guy have his house like this?
[93:05.97]Is it gonna take an hour?
[93:06.81]No, it's not.
[93:08.79]This is a really well-made experience.
[93:11.37]But this guy's house definitely shouldn't be built like this.
[93:17.24]He has just like a weird stairway to the top of his house.
[93:26.77]It's actually a bottle of booze.
[93:28.39]Alright, well here you go.
[93:31.37]I'm gonna jump and press fucking R1 and hope I fucking slash him.
[93:38.94]Thank you, Slayer.
[93:39.82]Please don't tell my wife.
[93:46.42]No, I'm not Mr. Meeseeks.
[93:53.48]I'm gonna get this one done.
[93:56.28]How did that get on the roof?
[93:57.24]Yeah, he just grabbed it by the handle and like... He threw it as hard as he could up there.
[94:10.17]God damn it.
[94:14.17]Look at me.
[94:19.63]I've been chasing my dog for hours.
[94:22.42]Could you help me catch him?
[94:25.00]Usually I kill wild beasts like your dog.
[94:27.22]Why would you say that?
[94:28.98]He's fast.
[94:29.66]I have gone dizzy running in circles.
[94:32.38]He's right behind you.
[94:42.59]Where did he go?
[94:50.78]Just grab him!
[94:51.52]He's right next to you!
[94:52.54]Grab him!
[94:58.04]He just hit his head on the wall.
[95:03.58]Come here.
[95:04.18]I'm just gonna wait in his path.
[95:09.98]His AI path goes this way.
[95:11.38]I'm just gonna wait there.
[95:17.52]Uh... Did I get him?
[95:25.13]Thank you, I'll make sure he behaves.
[95:26.47]Alright, only two more.
[95:35.03]You put your... I tripped him, yeah.
[95:36.37]I stuck my leg out.
[95:40.85]I did like a Tom and Jerry.
[95:48.29]I can't go.
[95:48.67]No, that's where I need to go.
[96:02.06]Drink the snow.
[96:03.16]You can't drink the snow.
[96:09.73]Where's the last two quests?
[96:11.29]There was one up here, right?
[96:14.59]I know, this is not supposed to be a Slayer Scrolls stream.
[96:19.36]I'm aware of that, but that's what it's turning into, but I just have to know what happened.
[96:30.18]This is the Dwarf, right?
[96:31.88]Did I kill this guy?
[96:36.23]I heard you went to the northern mountains, Slayer.
[96:39.41]Any chance you saw my twin brother there?
[96:43.65]Uh... His name is Studge.
[96:45.63]He's been missing for days.
[96:47.77]Yes, I killed him.
[96:49.51]Yeah, so there was a dragon up there.
[96:50.71]Maybe that got him.
[96:52.05]Yes, I think he regretted his life of crime and left for a new life.
[96:54.99]You are the first warp I've seen in years.
[97:05.85]There's a dragon up there.
[97:06.75]I think the dragon may have got him.
[97:08.15]So he really is dead.
[97:09.45]I always knew his life of crime will end this way.
[97:14.13]I'll miss him, but I'm glad you told me.
[97:17.39]I needed closure.
[97:18.73]Without him, I've decided to use my axe for honest work instead.
[97:23.91]Good.
[97:31.57]Look, I killed him, the dragon killed him, somebody killed him.
[97:35.37]That's all he needs to know.
[97:37.81]Right?
[97:48.26]Doesn't matter if I killed him or not.
[97:51.68]He's been killed.
[98:00.24]Yes, it does.
[98:02.88]Yeah, but he was a criminal.
[98:03.68]He just killed somebody.
[98:06.26]He literally robbed a guy and murdered him.
[98:08.32]And I got vengeance for that person that he was robbing and killing.
[98:13.37]Does it really matter if I got him or the dragon did?
[98:24.87]I heard you've been helping the people of this town.
[98:30.21]Slayer.
[98:31.39]I need your help too.
[98:32.26]Oh, by the way, I'm a Slayer.
[98:35.46]I'm not a negotiator.
[98:37.92]I'm a Slayer.
[98:39.62]It's in my name.
[98:40.40]It's in my first name.
[98:48.06]Monsters have shown up in the crypt below town.
[98:52.91]The other guards have sealed it shut.
[98:55.79]But I keep worrying what will happen if they get out.
[99:00.67]To be honest with you, being the first woman of the town guard, I feel like I have to prove myself.
[99:12.58]We're both going in?
[99:17.21]Yeah, let's both go in.
[99:18.93]Follow me.
[99:22.07]Do I have a weapon?
[99:22.69]I don't even have a weapon.
[99:31.04]Can I have a sword?
[99:31.90]We have to go down into the crypt.
[99:43.80]Oh, shit.
[99:44.54]Oh, we have a new card now.
[99:46.30]Spring Forest.
[99:47.34]This is where we went.
[99:56.69]This almost looks hand-painted.
[99:59.35]Gunblood.
[100:00.71]Point your gun in the air when ready.
[100:02.75]Aim.
[100:03.33]Fire.
[100:05.27]What?
[100:06.75]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[100:11.58]Aim?
[100:12.00]Okay, so, enemy AI is activated.
[100:14.22]Connectiv- Was that just- Oh!
[100:44.48]What?
[100:44.72]Hey!
[100:44.98]He didn't even give me a second!
[101:04.79]Oh my god!
[101:18.30]This is... Okay, come on, please.
[101:23.01]He's so much faster than I am.
[101:27.97]Did it.
[101:28.19]Okay, I won.
[101:30.07]Ooh.
[101:40.36]Slayer Scrolls!
[101:41.26]Enter the crypt.
[101:41.88]This crypt is older than the town.
[101:43.32]It has been here for ages.
[101:44.78]Now all of a sudden, the dead in the crypt have risen.
[101:48.03]I can't imagine what will happen to the town if they get out.
[101:51.01]We will clear the crypt of these monsters.
[101:58.09]Did she just get crushed?
[102:02.33]Did we both die?
[102:10.91]No.
[102:14.21]A little place in outer space.
[102:16.11]Is that it?
[102:22.13]L1.
[102:28.38]This is trippy.
[102:33.50]What the hell?
[102:42.15]I just have to activate all the objects?
[102:46.40]This really is Mario Galaxy.
[102:52.40]Yeah, this one's really, really awesome.
[102:55.20]This is really cool, but I'm gonna throw up if I keep playing it.
[103:07.81]It's gonna go slow.
[103:14.33]What the fuck?
[103:30.53]Is that where I just... Whoa.
[103:33.51]Don't look up.
[103:34.07]Don't look up.
[103:34.71]Ever.
[103:35.99]They always say don't look down, but in these 3D spherical games, don't look up.
[103:44.09]Did I make it all the way back around?
[103:50.97]This is wild.
[103:55.33]Which way is up?
[103:57.01]I don't know.
[103:58.71]Ready to go home?
[103:59.71]Yes, I'm tired.
[104:04.16]Slayer Scroll, Scene 8.
[104:05.90]Crypt fight.
[104:06.68]We still live.
[104:09.02]Alright, we ready?
[104:15.08]Where's, um... Where's my companion?
[104:25.11]Did she get crushed by the bronze?
[104:27.35]Holy shit!
[104:45.94]Oh, they're coming to life off the walls.
[104:50.32]Those eyes are terrifying.
[105:01.03]Where are you?
[105:17.05]Is this behind me?
[105:19.63]Where did you get the music for this stuff?
[105:25.68]Is it just baked in?
[105:31.64]Wait, that's her.
[105:32.56]Where have you been?
[105:36.61]I was so scared, I hid over here.
[105:39.17]I am sorry, Slayer.
[105:41.05]I am just not strong enough to be a guard.
[105:47.83]The other guards left this threat under the town.
[105:49.85]You are stronger than the rest to have come down here.
[105:52.69]If it helps, all you guards are puny cowards.
[105:55.89]Not just you.
[105:58.83]That's so... Wait, wait, that dialog, that's just so mean and rude.
[106:13.22]Like, hey, we've been nice the whole time.
[106:14.64]Let's see what the rude path is.
[106:28.42]Oh.
[106:30.22]I killed a monster!
[106:31.34]I can't wait to tell everyone!
[106:38.89]Crossing over?
[106:44.75]I can't wait to tell all my friends I did it!
[106:47.69]I slayed a skeleton!
[106:53.21]Ultra-realistic FPS prototype.
[106:56.47]Okay.
[106:59.48]Ultra realistic.
[107:00.66]Hold it.
[107:02.06]Inspect weapon.
[107:10.34]So this is ultra realistic.
[107:14.26]Eliminate the target at apartment 24 lane.
[107:18.91]You got it.
[107:21.07]The story continues after launch.
[107:24.91]Make sure you mark this one.
[107:25.81]24 lane.
[107:28.89]24 lane.
[107:31.74]There's an invisible wall here.
[107:32.80]I can't go any further.
[107:33.58]Where's 24 lane?
[107:35.88]24?
[107:47.91]I think that means that it's not done.
[108:00.64]24 lane is not available yet.
[108:02.20]I don't think I can shoot the gun.
[108:14.07]No, that is an invisible wall.
[108:16.47]Oh, just you wait!
[108:17.27]When this launches...
[108:29.29]Upstairs window.
[108:30.33]Oh, I can't even fire the gun.
[108:38.55]Window, window, window, what?
[108:41.63]What do you mean window?
[108:48.33]Door, window, door, window.
[108:50.62]I can't shoot the gun.
[108:55.66]Whoa, whoa!
[108:58.70]That's a person's head, right?
[108:59.64]With their ears?
[109:01.94]He's looking out the window right now.
[109:02.92]See his ears?
[109:07.50]Fucking controller aim.
[109:16.66]My god.
[109:27.73]Beautiful stone wall town.
[109:29.19]No, it can't be!
[109:30.23]Wait, they burnt the town?
[109:31.39]Who burnt the town to the ground?
[109:34.63]This is really, really raging!
[109:40.29]It can't be!
[109:43.24]Don't walk through the fire!
[109:48.52]Um... What do we- how do we- what do we do?
[110:03.39]Do I have to jump it?
[110:08.81]Can we talk?
[110:20.34]Fight the fire.
[110:21.28]I don't even have a sword anymore.
[110:28.34]Is there another exit?
[110:31.37]Eat an apple!
[110:32.85]That didn't do anything.
[110:34.84]Oh, it gave me extra health.
[110:42.12]Uh... I think we may have gotten to the end of this one.
[110:50.01]Didn't I kill the dragon?
[111:05.05]An arrow right through her head.
[111:09.87]I heard there might be a fellow slayer in Stonewall.
[111:13.05]I expected more from you, but thank you.
[111:15.79]Slaying a slayer always brings me great pleasure.
[111:18.80]Nice rhyme.
[111:21.66]She sells slayers on the seashore.
[111:23.80]Slayers and pleasure.
[111:26.45]I want you to know, Slayer, as much joy as I get from this massacre, I do not think you died onto this for fun.
[111:34.52]This was all written on a scroll!
[111:40.92]Holy shit, that's insane looking.
[111:52.87]What a twist, yeah?
[112:00.92]That's really, really awesome looking.
[112:02.70]Okay, I... Cone ball.
[112:05.98]I need to... This is too much fun, though.
[112:07.94]It's too interesting.
[112:08.76]Okay, I'm gonna make something.
[112:11.04]Even if it's something stupid.
[112:13.32]Move, jump, charge.
[112:16.16]Release when charged to slam.
[112:18.27]Jump and slam down for extra power.
[112:23.07]Move, jump, and then charge.
[112:24.45]Okay.
[112:27.71]Goals to win...
[112:38.20]Here we go.
[112:41.74]Oh, fuck.
[112:42.40]Hold on.
[112:42.96]Slayer Scrolls by Life Took Lemons.
[112:46.12]The saga has only begun.
[112:58.57]I can't wait for Slayer Scrolls 2 to come out.
[113:05.65]Alright, here we go.
[113:06.11]Coneball.
[113:06.65]Let's go.
[113:13.04]After credits screen.
[113:15.88]Three, two, one.
[113:18.98]Action!
[113:23.76]Oh, I'm red.
[113:27.10]I thought I was blue.
[113:28.12]Didn't I select blue?
[113:29.42]I selected blue.
[113:41.93]Oh, goddammit.
[113:43.05]This is just Rocket League.
[113:46.46]Or soccer.
[113:47.72]Not everything is Rocket League.
[113:48.70]Rocket League is based off of playing soccer.
[113:51.60]So... Have I really become one of those, like, millennials?
[113:54.94]That doesn't even say the name of the thing that it is.
[113:57.54]I've referenced the, like... It's Rocket League.
[114:00.16]This is not Rocket League, it's football!
[114:05.54]Goddamn millennials, right?
[114:07.12]Millennials are calling shit when it's not supposed to be called!
[114:19.24]That doesn't... That doesn't count?
[114:22.17]Look, if I play basketball and I go under the hoop and I throw it up so it goes under the bottom of the net, it's not a basket.
[114:32.61]Fucking millennials!
[114:37.96]What is this called?
[114:38.78]Polarity.
[114:39.94]Press X to start.
[114:48.45]I thought X jumped.
[114:50.01]Apparently not.
[114:51.25]X turns you blue.
[115:01.86]Press X to repel from blue platforms.
[115:06.62]Oh.
[115:08.10]Press circle to repel from red platforms.
[115:24.13]This is really interesting though, this is neat.
[115:32.26]I can't wait to make something neat like this.
[115:39.18]How do I get that?
[115:53.54]Ooh.
[115:55.02]Nice.
[115:55.48]Alright.
[115:58.28]That's gonna be odd.
[116:05.06]Finish!
[116:09.90]Paddle Extreme Ultra DX.
[116:13.68]No way.
[116:16.10]There's even Pong.
[116:20.35]I'm not very... I'm not good at Pong.
[116:21.57]I told you.
[116:32.70]This is just Rocket League.
[116:35.38]Oh cool, and you're playing Pixel Rocket League.
[116:43.09]No, no, you call it what it's supposed to be called and that's Pong.
[116:52.08]It's not Pong, though.
[116:53.12]You're using the Boomer Rocket League terminology.
[116:56.40]I know, I'm aware of this.
[116:58.52]It's tennis, but we called it Pong when I was 12.
[117:01.42]Can I score once on this guy?
[117:24.05]You know, a friend of mine actually taught me how to play Pong well, and it's hard to do, but actually it's a pretty good tactic.
[117:30.37]You should never look on the right side of the screen when you play Pong.
[117:33.59]You should only be looking on your side of the screen.
[117:37.87]That is what I was told to do, and it actually is the way you're supposed to play, because it makes it so you can adjust very, very quickly.
[117:45.03]Never look at what the ball's doing on their side of the screen, but, you know, that's a great tip, actually.
[117:51.18]Somebody said that was a bad tip.
[117:52.36]No, it's not.
[117:57.66]Uh, this person that told me this, by the way, uh, never lost one game of Pong.
[118:02.78]They could go for, like, four hours.
[118:04.48]They had, like, one of those high scores where it was, like, a two to three hour long experience.
[118:08.74]This is all made up.
[118:09.68]None of this is true.
[118:10.90]But take my word for it that you should be looking at your side of the screen.
[118:14.59]And it's okay.
[118:15.63]I'm just gonna go this way.
[118:19.27]Marble us.
[118:21.79]Marble us.
[118:22.59]Ooh, I get it.
[118:26.83]This one's called Eye.
[118:27.57]Alright.
[118:29.22]I like how we're getting these Terms of Service end-user license agreements.
[118:31.64]Don't fade into the dark.
[118:32.26]Reach for the light.
[118:59.03]Created by Disarmed.
[119:06.89]Move!
[119:21.04]Gun.
[119:24.26]Added to inventory.
[119:27.38]Inventory.
[119:29.48]Okay.
[119:29.68]Okay.
[119:30.68]New path unlocked.
[119:31.30]Environment.
[120:09.73]Green Grass Groove.
[120:11.85]Oh no.
[120:16.47]But it's just a ball.
[120:19.93]Green Grass Groove.
[120:21.67]Sonic!
[120:25.03]It's just a Sonic meatball.
[120:38.19]Pretty good job with the sounds, though.
[120:40.41]And I like the terrain.
[120:41.55]Good job with the terrain, too.
[120:42.57]Alright, is it time to start to make something?
[120:48.99]I want to see what... I just want to check out the tools, and... It's time.
[120:53.67]We got a pretty good taste.
[120:56.53]We'll do one more after this.
[120:59.63]Can I do any other moves?
[121:00.53]Like, Sonic moves?
[121:02.07]You know, like the Sonic Dash and shit?
[121:03.71]Oh, here's a chest.
[121:05.14]I need 15 coins to open this.
[121:12.43]What the hell is that?
[121:14.57]Wait, did I just... Did I just unlock that?
[121:25.57]I think I just actually... That's mine now.
[121:32.39]Alright, let's take a look at what we can do.
[121:36.97]Last one.
[121:38.19]This is called 2.
[121:38.71]We need to see this.
[121:47.76]Find the code for the keypad.
[121:54.59]Hold L1 to sprint.
[121:57.03]I don't think I want to do that.
[121:58.07]That kinda hurts my head.
[122:11.99]This is so cool that this is even possible, though.
[122:17.56]Do I have any bullets?
[122:25.58]Painkillers.
[122:27.66]Ooh, I'm stable now.
[122:30.84]Can motion blur be turned off?
[122:32.44]Well, this is on PS4.
[122:34.22]I don't know if it can.
[122:35.50]Let's see.
[122:36.40]My preferences.
[122:38.91]Display.
[122:40.31]Visual feedback.
[122:43.13]um menu position prompts accessibility uh controls no it's ps4 as we all know you cannot really change any graphical options on the PlayStation 4 or any console for that matter it's just locked in
[123:11.85]It is locked in.
[123:12.99]Where do I go here?
[123:32.20]What is this?
[123:36.16]Power?
[123:38.27]Power to what?
[123:40.80]Well, it looks like we're gonna follow this.
[123:47.36]Yeah, this is PS4 only.
[123:50.80]Can I pull this chain?
[123:56.55]Can I just interact with the door?
[123:57.65]I can't interact with the chain.
[124:09.26]Oh, the keypad.
[124:23.04]But I don't have the key code.
[124:27.06]The game already exists on PC.
[124:28.76]It's called Unity.
[124:31.72]Yeah, but you'll see when we actually get to the creating aspect of it.
[124:38.12]It's not... I mean, it is a game engine, but it's not, at the same time, it's also like an art set.
[124:47.54]It's like painting and sculpting and... I can't go over here?
[124:55.30]It's like LittleBigPlanet 4.
[124:57.00]It's like they took LittleBigPlanet and said, you know what, let's make this ten times more elaborate.
[125:04.14]Turn on.
[125:05.48]Well.
[125:06.46]New path unlocked.
[125:13.19]Alright, well.
[125:17.35]What the hell is that?
[125:20.05]Connected.
[125:20.51]Is it like a monster now?
[125:35.05]Alright, it's time.
[125:38.66]Oh, shi- alright, here we go, with perfect timing!
[125:42.08]Auto-surf complete!
[125:43.98]You experienced 30 creations, let us know what you thought to help us with future surfing.
[125:51.38]Oh, okay, we can go through and rate them.
[125:57.00]I remember this, this is- we already had this one, uh, what was this one that- this one was pretty cool!
[126:04.59]What does it say?
[126:05.63]This has been thumbed up 14,000 times.
[126:10.15]PT.
[126:10.75]I'm going to give PT a thumbs up, but not all the PTs.
[126:14.31]Please hug me.
[126:14.99]That was cool.
[126:18.36]Curiosity.
[126:18.98]Curiosity was really, really technically well done, but the game there was a little just, I don't know.
[126:27.66]I think I already rated this one.
[126:31.24]I forget what this one even was.
[126:34.04]Oh, this one, I like that one.
[126:37.54]Yeah, thumbs up that one.
[126:38.70]Super Mario, gotta thumbs that one up.
[126:41.52]Dark Dungeon, Dark Souls, yeah, let me throw the thumbs that one up.
[126:45.92]Oh, this is the Guitar Hero one.
[126:47.25]Yeah, that was good.
[126:48.85]Ramp 3D, I don't know, eh, yeah, no, it was good.
[126:53.43]Slayer Scrolls, absolutely thumbs up.
[126:56.87]Oi, what are you looking at?
[126:57.99]Thumbs up.
[127:01.64]Uh, I'm not going to rate it because it wasn't bad, but it was just kind of a little demo of the environment.
[127:08.26]It's the Zelda Forest Book of the Dragon.
[127:13.02]Working portal gun demo.
[127:14.16]I'm going to give you a thumbs up just because.
[127:16.33]PlayStation Home, I don't, I didn't really, I'm not going to downrate it, but thumbs this up.
[127:21.95]What is it?
[127:22.85]Oh, okay, I already have it rated.
[127:23.91]The Encounter is well done.
[127:27.77]Art Gallery, I don't need to rate it.
[127:29.95]Gunblood is the,
[127:32.87]The duel.
[127:33.37]Here's Mario Odyssey.
[127:34.39]I'm not going to rate it and make me almost puke, but it was still cool.
[127:38.08]Ultra-realistic FPS prototype.
[127:39.50]I'm not going to rate it.
[127:41.88]It wasn't anything really there.
[127:43.48]It was an interesting environment, though.
[127:46.24]Coneball?
[127:46.94]Eh.
[127:47.80]Polarity?
[127:48.80]It was cute, but I don't know if I wanted to give it.
[127:50.80]I'm going to give Rocket League... I'm going to give 1980s Rocket League a thumbs up.
[127:56.85]This is the Sonic one, and then this is the currently bugged version of Visceral.
[128:01.21]Alright, I think we're good.
[128:05.58]Very, very cool.
[128:07.72]Alright.
[128:09.36]I leveled up.
[128:09.92]Animation, audio, curation, design, play, art.
[128:16.45]What did I do?
[128:18.31]You are level 3.
[128:19.81]You're still finding your way in the Dreamiverse, so we can't assign you a person yet.
[128:25.45]We should have a better idea of who you are by level 5.
[128:27.82]Okay.
[128:31.24]Okay.
[128:33.89]It's my personality test.
[128:39.25]So we got... We did auto-surf.
[128:43.23]Haunted mansion with kitchen.
[128:45.11]Alright, let's just go back.
[128:48.05]And actually do dream shaping.
[128:51.29]Let's see what we can do.
[129:00.12]I'm very, very ready.
[129:04.13]This is dream shaping.
[129:06.83]Here you have the power to manifest anything you can imagine.
[129:11.77]Anything.
[129:13.49]Music, a story, a piece of art, a whole game, even something there is no word for yet.
[129:22.32]Create things from scratch using the dream tools.
[129:26.10]You can use them to remix something another dreamer has made.
[129:31.68]Maybe not that long.
[129:32.36]How is there not porn on this yet?
[129:34.72]How- what are you talking about?
[129:36.86]It's been up for like four days, relax.
[129:38.88]Or what, like a week?
[129:40.14]Not even?
[129:59.63]No, no, no, don't relax.
[130:00.49]Like, relax as in it's not going to be here.
[130:02.29]Okay, start dreaming one tutorial to unlock this feature.
[130:10.96]Wait, what?
[130:13.48]Okay, we have to do the dreams workshop.
[130:16.80]Masterclasses and techniques.
[130:19.14]I'm ready.
[130:24.91]I'm so excited for this.
[130:28.65]So you want to learn the ropes of dream shaping.
[130:32.05]But you don't know where the tools are on the shelf.
[130:34.96]Or how to use that intriguing gadget.
[130:37.96]Or you want to know what that strange contraption over there does.
[130:42.00]Architect, assist us.
[130:45.74]think it'd be easy let me do hello architect hello queenie uh why am I a squirrel just a temporary physical form for you I like it it's cute well thank you it's better than the last one
[131:02.85]Now, show this Dream Shaper how to unleash their creative powers.
[131:07.52]Mm-hmm.
[131:07.90]Done.
[131:08.78]Follow me, Dreamer.
[131:10.00]Oh, it's so exciting that you're here.
[131:11.62]I have been really looking forward to this.
[131:13.70]There is so much to show you.
[131:15.48]Gameplay, animation, art.
[131:18.00]There's no limit to what's possible.
[131:22.73]Give me the tools.
[131:23.81]This is the Dreams Workshop.
[131:25.47]We got a lot of tools.
[131:26.31]Whoa.
[131:26.47]Okay.
[131:26.65]So, guys...
[131:33.46]We all, I think, can be comfortable knowing that this is gonna, we're probably gonna do this for a while.
[131:41.95]Uh, start dreaming.
[131:42.71]Gain the power to make your own dreams come true by first getting to know the basics.
[131:50.01]Two months of streams.
[131:53.54]Oh, Jesus.
[131:55.84]Are you new to dream shaping?
[131:57.36]The start dreaming tutorials are your entry point to creating.
[132:00.22]Here you'll get to know the basics of edit mode, navigating scenes, and the assembly tools.
[132:04.09]There are eight steps.
[132:09.11]Part one, step one of probably 50 to 100 parts.
[132:16.73]You're just doing a labo.
[132:18.01]Going blind?
[132:18.93]You can't do that.
[132:22.11]And I physically can't do that because I have to complete this first.
[132:27.44]No, I'm gonna do this.
[132:28.34]I've been waiting a long time for this game.
[132:30.26]I've been waiting a decade for this game to come out.
[132:34.42]I've been waiting longer for Dreams than I probably have for the Winds of Winter.
[132:38.92]It's a long time.
[132:43.08]So I'm gonna start.
[132:46.99]Find Connie's first... What's going on?
[132:49.89]I've got some spectacular tricks to show you.
[132:52.93]And some that are just... alright.
[132:56.95]Make sure you follow the steps carefully if you want to get the most out of this I need to start drinking Um, no, it's not just about getting to the end.
[133:05.82]It's the journey that counts I'm not gonna start drinking.
[133:09.84]You'll be in edit mode creating and editing your own scenes First I'm gonna show you how to move around the scene Alright, so this is the scene
[133:26.19]I don't get it.
[133:26.73]I'm done.
[133:27.27]I'll see you tomorrow.
[133:29.05]You can see that we're in edit mode because the assembly mode icon is in the top left of the screen.
[133:34.21]Okay.
[133:35.61]If you ever need to remind yourself of the controls, select that icon with the X button.
[133:40.94]Okay, so we're in assembly mode.
[133:41.86]And select it again to hide the controls.
[133:46.24]You can also see the assembly menu at the top of the screen.
[133:50.16]That's where you'll find all the tools and modes you need to construct your scenes.
[133:55.87]The assembly menu is opened and closed by pressing the square button.
[134:00.69]You won't need it just yet, so go ahead and close it with square.
[134:06.86]First, I'm gonna show you how to move around in edit mode, as it's a bit different from play mode.
[134:13.44]To give you something to do, I've hidden a puppet somewhere in the scene, which we'll need in later tutorials.
[134:21.25]I've left some clues to help you find it.
[134:23.77]It's probably behind this.
[134:24.73]Before we search for the first clue, let's start by looking around.
[134:28.94]Left stick?
[134:30.60]In front of you, you can see a floating island with some shapes on it.
[134:34.26]I can.
[134:35.64]If you move the right stick to the left and right, you can look around the scene.
[134:42.21]Is there an orange cone around here?
[134:44.37]Um, um... You found it.
[134:47.53]No, I didn't.
[134:49.38]There's a blue cube around here somewhere, too.
[134:52.00]What?
[134:53.49]See if you can find that.
[134:54.73]Oh, they're talking about in the outer space.
[134:58.19]Now try looking up with the right stick to find the pink pyramid.
[135:04.85]That's the one.
[135:07.47]OK, let's turn back towards the shapes floating on the island.
[135:12.56]My first clue.
[135:13.62]Yeah, I looked at it already.
[135:15.82]This is your clue.
[135:16.82]I already knew that.
[135:17.76]There's the clue.
[135:18.76]It's right here.
[135:43.40]Circle it.
[135:44.34]Once you've found the clue, you're ready to move on to the next step.
[135:50.34]If you want to rewatch this step, you can.
[135:53.97]Hover your imp over the buttons on the video to see what they do.
[135:57.31]We're almost done.
[135:59.47]Use the buttons to move between tutorial steps.
[136:03.09]Or just rewind 10 seconds if you miss something.
[136:07.19]If the video gets in your way, grab and move it with your imp using R2.
[136:12.73]Okay.
[136:13.51]You can minimize the video and play along with audio only.
[136:17.08]That's what I'm going to do.
[136:18.44]Or you can maximize it to watch in instructions view.
[136:21.94]Maximize the video?
[136:23.52]In instructions view, you can see more information about the steps.
[136:29.26]Once the current step is finished, press the arrow button to move on to the next one.
[136:35.05]Three, fifty, two, done.
[136:38.93]Second to do- Did you find that clue?
[136:42.24]It was on the back of one of those shapes.
[136:45.58]Looks a bit like a rocket.
[136:47.82]So this really does treat you like you're four.
[136:50.93]Why don't you look around with the right stick for any rocket-related goings-on?
[136:55.25]Anything related to rockets.
[136:56.75]Look over there.
[136:58.15]On that island in the distance.
[136:59.93]Okay, island in the distance.
[137:01.81]Those shapes look a lot like the ones in the clue.
[137:04.27]They do.
[137:06.14]Go on.
[137:07.04]Fly over there and check it out.
[137:10.03]remember push up on the left stick to move forward and use the right stick to change direction and Don't forget you can recalibrate your imp by holding the options button.
[137:20.76]Yes, and make sure you do a loop two loops wrap around and pull To keep your shoes on alright.
[137:29.00]What's what I do now island make sure you're looking right at the cylinder and the cone and
[137:35.03]When you're ready, move on to the next step.
[137:37.51]Oh, fuck, that was all I had to do?
[137:38.69]Well, these steps are really easy, though, so way to go to blow through this.
[137:43.06]Think back to the first clue.
[137:45.44]The cone was on top of the cylinder, right?
[137:49.70]But how can you move them?
[137:51.94]Well, in edit mode, you interact with everything using your imp.
[137:56.09]The very tip of your imp's pointer bar.
[137:58.07]He's just going to show us how to make a porn game.
[137:59.87]See how there's an icon in a circle there?
[138:01.41]I don't believe that will.
[138:03.05]That shows you what tool the imp is using.
[138:06.91]Right now, it's the arrows icon.
[138:08.91]Clone.
[138:09.31]Which means the imp is using the move tool.
[138:12.91]That's the default tool in edit mode because editing a scene means moving things around a lot.
[138:19.80]Let's see the imp in action.
[138:22.06]First, grab the cone.
[138:24.14]Hover over it with your imp and hold R2.
[138:29.36]Now your imp has the cone, use the controller's motion sensor function to move it around.
[138:36.40]Try to put it on top of the cylinder, just like in the clue.
[138:41.69]Use the left stick to move the cone backwards and forwards.
[138:47.43]Next.
[138:47.79]119, 120.
[138:47.85]Got it.
[139:07.72]Now, that looks pretty good.
[139:10.26]At least from this angle.
[139:11.52]I mean, it doesn't, but... Creating scenes in three-dimensional space means that you should always look at your creations from different angles.
[139:19.28]That's such a shitty job.
[139:20.53]No, it's not.
[139:21.15]The easiest way to do that is with the grab cam.
[139:23.73]Grab cam.
[139:24.63]See, I didn't even know about that.
[139:26.07]Instead of moving the objects you grab, grab cam moves your point of view around them.
[139:32.57]Try it out on the cone.
[139:35.46]Grab cam.
[139:36.40]Hover over it, then press and hold R1.
[139:42.24]Pushing the left and right sticks moves your point of view around the cone.
[139:46.77]Easy.
[139:47.17]Okay.
[139:50.07]Now that you can get a proper look at it, check that the cone is on straight.
[139:54.55]Unlike mine.
[139:57.37]Let go of R1 to stop using the grab cam.
[140:01.21]And use R2 to make any adjustments you need.
[140:06.58]Here's a little secret called nudge.
[140:10.24]If you don't press R2 all the way down, but just hold it lightly, you can move the cone slowly, giving you finer control.
[140:19.97]Perfect.
[140:21.83]Once you're happy the cone is straight, you can move on to the next step.
[140:25.25]That's perfect.
[140:25.65]I'm done.
[140:25.83]Hey, look at that.
[140:32.41]Did you find the clue?
[140:33.83]Another clue.
[140:35.33]It's a molecule.
[140:38.34]I know because I put it there.
[140:41.00]Just play along with me.
[140:41.87]Okay, there's the clue.
[140:42.41]What do you want me to do with it?
[140:43.93]Why don't you look around with the right stick and see if you can find another molecule?
[140:50.75]There's one.
[140:52.01]Over there by that island.
[140:54.01]You're hot on the trail.
[140:55.39]I didn't even look and he told me.
[140:57.51]It'll take forever to get there using the left stick.
[141:01.03]Luckily you can use the grab cam to get there faster.
[141:05.43]Give it a try now.
[141:07.84]Hover your imp over that orange cube in the distance.
[141:11.97]Hold R1 to grab it with the grab cam.
[141:14.57]Yeah.
[141:16.05]And then fly in.
[141:16.69]Then gently push up on the left stick to zoom right over.
[141:19.57]I get it.
[141:21.69]Just keep holding R1 until you've made it all the way to the- Come on, come on, come on, come on!
[141:27.35]See?
[141:28.29]Told you it was quicker.
[141:31.11]But there's an even faster way to zip around scenes.
[141:35.26]It's just like the grab cam, but you'll also need to hold L1.
[141:40.32]You see, L1 is a very special button.
[141:43.02]Tell me more.
[141:43.88]You know the way that on a computer keyboard, holding down shift changes what some keys do?
[141:49.42]Oh, it's a function key.
[141:51.08]Holding down L1 changes what the other buttons do.
[141:55.70]Maybe it's best if I show you.
[141:58.30]You see that rocket you built earlier?
[142:00.82]Hover your imp over it.
[142:03.35]Now hold L1 and then press R1, the grab cam button.
[142:07.81]You don't have to hold it or use the stick this time.
[142:10.17]So you can just fly around.
[142:11.93]Whoa!
[142:13.01]Fast, huh?
[142:13.73]Just scared the shit out of him.
[142:14.65]Try it out again on the return journey.
[142:18.73]Hover your imp over the orange cube and hold L1.
[142:21.61]I already did it.
[142:23.43]Then press R1 to zoom right on over.
[142:30.32]No, fuck.
[142:33.62]I want to go forward 10 seconds.
[142:38.40]Just hold it lightly.
[142:40.04]You can move the cone slowly.
[142:41.70]What?
[142:42.16]Giving you finer control.
[142:43.96]Wait, what?
[142:44.46]Oh, this is the wrong one.
[142:49.18]Hey, look at that.
[142:51.20]Oh, but find it's the old...
[142:54.98]Okay, that was it.
[142:55.86]Okay, find the clue on the island.
[142:57.70]Alright.
[142:57.92]Yeah.
[142:58.02]Underneath?
[142:58.30]You want me to... Is that it?
[142:59.74]I found it.
[143:00.00]Trash can.
[143:24.99]Did you find the last clue?
[143:27.94]It was on the back of the orange cube.
[143:31.22]What on Earth could it mean?
[143:32.36]Trash can.
[143:33.26]If I had eyes, I would wink at you right now.
[143:35.74]Hmm, I can't see any other green trash can in edit mode using the triangle button.
[143:42.39]Got it.
[143:43.61]Just hover your imp over the cube, then press triangle.
[143:48.66]And it's gone.
[143:51.18]These tools are powerful.
[143:53.82]Delete the orange sphere next.
[143:58.06]If you change your mind or delete the wrong thing, you can press undo, which is the left directional button.
[144:05.63]And if you want to redo, just press the right directional button.
[144:11.65]You can undo and redo pretty much anything, not just deletions.
[144:17.83]It means to go up.
[144:19.15]Nice.
[144:19.87]Hmm.
[144:20.11]Ooh, found it.
[144:20.41]Excellent.
[144:42.49]We're almost done.
[144:43.27]That was my final clue telling you where to go.
[144:46.43]The island right above us.
[144:49.67]I know you're an expert in moving around with the left and right stick.
[144:54.02]You're an expert in moving with the left stick.
[144:58.22]Remember that holding L1 changes what the grab cam does.
[145:02.98]It can also change what the left stick does.
[145:06.89]Sure.
[145:07.27]Normally it moves you backwards and forwards in the direction you're facing.
[145:11.93]You move up and down.
[145:12.99]That's good.
[145:13.41]Cool.
[145:13.65]Get up to the last island.
[145:14.44]I'm on the last island.
[145:15.18]Oh.
[145:15.26]I will.
[145:39.26]right here's the puppet I reserved for you almost done let's call her connie because she looks like a cone we need to help connie walk through the door to complete this tutorial r2 to do that we're gonna have to switch over to play mode finally let me get some new info finally some new intel you're in edit mode this is where you create and edit your scenes
[146:05.28]In play mode, you can experience the scene just like a player would if they found it in the Dreamiverse.
[146:12.81]You can't make any changes in play mode, but you can take control of characters and try out what you've made.
[146:18.97]Okay.
[146:20.93]Switch over to play mode now.
[146:22.85]Just press the options button on your controller.
[146:27.00]Play mode.
[146:28.44]Hover over the controller icon with your imp, then press X to select it.
[146:34.70]I just did that.
[146:35.26]Alright.
[146:36.12]So now I get to play the game with whatever characters are here.
[146:39.46]I gotta play something.
[146:40.36]There's no stairs there.
[146:57.24]Oh, looks like the door's too high.
[147:00.34]Died in tutorial.
[147:01.32]Died in tutorial.
[147:03.54]She might be able to reach it if you make her jump by pressing X. Wait, I just did that.
[147:09.62]Oops.
[147:10.98]I remember now.
[147:11.82]I'm like 20 seconds ahead of him.
[147:15.29]Better head back into edit mode.
[147:20.22]Alright.
[147:20.40]How do I select something?
[147:21.22]Tools.
[147:21.36]Modes.
[147:21.50]Animate.
[147:21.68]Gadgets.
[147:22.06]Strafe down to... No, they're right here.
[147:23.98]They're here.
[147:52.57]Okay.
[147:53.57]Press and hold R2 to grab them.
[147:57.13]Now without letting go, hold L1 and use the left stick to strafe back up to Connie.
[148:02.64]I'm already ahead of you.
[148:06.28]Place the stairs in front of the door and let go of R2.
[148:12.09]It's a little shitty, but it doesn't matter.
[148:14.39]Okay.
[148:14.51]Tutorial 1 done.
[148:14.89]Saving tutorial progress, thank god.
[148:16.21]Don't have to do it again.
[148:36.17]Star Dreaming Part 1 of 4.
[148:38.07]Well done.
[148:38.41]You completed this tutorial.
[148:39.19]You will be able to return and replay any of the steps.
[148:41.83]Only a few more of these.
[148:46.49]Use reward.
[148:48.25]Continue tutorials.
[148:49.25]Imp quest complete.
[148:53.14]Use... What is this?
[148:53.88]Use reward?
[149:00.34]What do I get for this?
[149:08.22]HomeSpace editor?
[149:09.14]Is that what this is?
[149:11.40]Ah, the HomeSpace editor.
[149:13.24]A great place to start your creative journey.
[149:16.14]We're still working on this right now.
[149:18.58]In time, you'll be able to put things you've made... So this is not done.
[149:21.85]So it feels like your own.
[149:23.07]Alright, so, not done.
[149:31.35]Look at all the wonderful things you've found.
[149:35.20]There's lots more where these came from.
[149:37.48]Prizes.
[149:38.00]And look at the things the folks at Media Molecule left for you in MM stuff.
[149:45.08]MM characters.
[149:46.89]Collection of characters created by the MM team.
[149:48.99]Contraptions.
[149:50.35]Sculptures.
[149:52.21]Okay.
[149:56.67]What was this thing?
[149:57.49]That looks fancy.
[149:59.67]Where's Nice Frick to go?
[150:02.97]Definitely so I can get... I want to unlock this.
[150:05.19]I want to get this thing.
[150:06.31]And put it over here.
[150:12.23]Like down here, right?
[150:13.41]So I can jump?
[150:18.71]Oh shit, I just placed two.
[150:20.80]Alright, that's good.
[150:24.56]Oh, whoops.
[150:27.06]It's okay, I can fix it.
[150:33.39]Alright, I can get that thing now, and let me get this thing.
[150:35.65]Okay, give me... over here.
[150:50.56]These have collision, right?
[150:55.56]Alright, got another toy.
[151:01.99]I might as well get this too while I'm still here.
[151:11.40]Oops.
[151:12.52]Wait.
[151:15.14]Can I just pick you up?
[151:16.78]No.
[151:18.56]I'm gonna do the stairs.
[151:19.88]Might as well just do the stairs.
[151:36.23]Can't jump?
[151:37.35]Can I not jump off the stairs?
[151:38.27]That was weird.
[151:41.25]Alright.
[151:42.77]Back to tutorial!
[151:48.33]Dream shaping!
[151:51.49]Level 4.
[151:51.77]What do you get for leveling up?
[152:01.94]You still finding your way?
[152:02.88]We can't assign you Persona.
[152:04.54]Level 5.
[152:06.08]Alright, I can browse and create.
[152:12.29]I feel like I need to know the other things.
[152:19.68]Let's just see what happens.
[152:29.04]Go in raw.
[152:31.50]You'll be creating and editing your own scene.
[152:34.25]Recreate PT.
[152:36.37]Scenes are like levels in a game or scenes in a movie.
[152:41.19]They're made up of elements.
[152:43.45]Elements are like props, sets, music, effects, and characters.
[152:48.29]Hey, this is going to be bizarre.
[152:49.57]Anything that you can build inside a scene and save to the Dreamiverse.
[152:54.55]Scenes are connected together to form dreams.
[152:57.49]Mm-hmm.
[152:58.75]And these dreams can be found when you go dream-surfing.
[153:03.56]Recreate the tutorial.
[153:06.42]That would be pretty hard.
[153:09.54]Scenes are like scenes!
[153:12.66]Alright, collection.
[153:14.12]Store- game scenes.
[153:15.33]Single-player co-op puzzle interactive experiences.
[153:19.23]Features, shorts, visual novels, sit back and enjoy.
[153:23.19]Galleries, Playlists, Expos, Characters, Sculpture, Contraption, Music, Sound Effect, Instrument, Vehicle, Animation, Effect, Dreams!
[153:39.50]Oh my god!
[153:40.38]Um... Um... I'm gonna pick Instrument.
[153:46.97]I think.
[153:49.93]Soft Piano?
[154:01.93]Create.
[154:02.95]How do I... Dreamers.
[154:11.38]Make a dating sim.
[154:12.50]Well, hold on.
[154:13.22]I first... Sub sound?
[154:16.90]No.
[154:20.40]Strings.
[154:25.27]Um...
[154:33.79]Various string playing techniques too, from legato to Cole.
[154:37.83]I'm viewing the music?
[155:08.38]Where is it?
[155:08.78]Is it up there?
[155:20.28]Whoa!
[155:34.40]Um...
[155:39.81]What?
[155:40.16]So you can do CAF volume?
[155:49.09]Spice?
[155:50.73]Bend?
[155:52.51]This is why we need the tutorials.
[155:58.96]Holy shit.
[156:26.68]um um
[157:08.39]Okay, that's it.
[157:09.65]How does that sound?
[157:13.07]How do I play it?
[157:34.38]Rewind and pause and record.
[157:37.98]The perform tool.
[157:39.06]You're in sound mode.
[157:40.00]I need perform tool.
[157:42.82]Play mode?
[157:47.62]Because I can't select that.
[157:49.20]Perform tool?
[157:52.98]You know, if only there was some way to learn all this.
[157:55.32]Yeah, I know.
[157:56.83]I'm getting out of here.
[158:04.27]I can't even leave.
[158:05.15]Effect field?
[158:17.76]Look at all this stuff.
[158:21.64]You could spend a thousand hours in this game and still be figuring out how to do it.
[158:27.81]Vehicle?
[158:29.01]Sound effects?
[158:29.97]Hold on.
[158:35.00]Underground catacombs.
[158:37.88]Air horn.
[158:43.83]Really?
[158:44.15]So you can just pull- so you can upload sounds then.
[159:01.09]Sports ball, okay.
[159:04.12]You can make your own music, contraptions, sculpture, character, game scene.
[159:11.21]Alright.
[159:12.09]I'm going and I'm doing the tutorials.
[159:14.57]I'm just gonna do them.
[159:15.39]You know what I mean?
[159:16.07]You have to.
[159:18.01]You cannot go into a game like this blind.
[159:19.91]It's just not possible.
[159:21.35]So here we go.
[159:26.64]Two out of four.
[159:32.22]Making things bigger and smaller.
[159:37.47]Now you've got the hang of it.
[159:40.59]It's time to master manipulating objects.
[159:43.38]I can't just not do this.
[159:44.72]Just as well, because Connie's friend Cuthbert fell asleep in the Dreamiverse and got stranded.
[159:51.16]Yes, he's a cube with legs.
[159:53.84]Connie didn't choose her friends.
[159:56.13]I did.
[159:57.83]So, we need to fix these platforms if she's gonna reach the flag and get to Cuthbert.
[160:04.77]Before we start, you can switch to play mode to see how a player would experience this scene.
[160:10.02]Yeah, it's already all screwed up.
[160:12.72]You'll always need to test things out in play mode.
[160:15.82]I can't jump to this.
[160:19.86]Bad design.
[160:21.63]Then select play mode with X. Its icon looks like a controller.
[160:27.25]I know.
[160:28.61]Once you're in play mode...
[160:32.01]Can't do it.
[160:32.53]Yep.
[160:33.63]Let's pull this over here.
[160:36.29]Move this back.
[160:37.05]That looks good.
[160:38.07]I can go like this, rotate.
[160:40.90]Sit you back here.
[161:01.75]Is that good?
[161:02.65]Looks alright.
[161:06.80]Sort of.
[161:07.96]Yeah, it's fine.
[161:09.18]And then this one has to be grown.
[161:10.94]Look, I'm going to see if I can figure it out on my own, right?
[161:14.30]And then... So, for instance, resize.
[161:19.68]Makes sense.
[161:20.18]Like that.
[161:34.26]Okay, it's a little tilted, but that's fine.
[161:36.78]Alright, now let's play this.
[161:39.00]I'm going to play the video.
[161:39.60]We're going to do it fast.
[161:40.64]Ready?
[161:43.88]Yeah.
[161:44.10]Move tool.
[161:44.46]I moved it.
[161:45.02]Yep, R2.
[162:03.73]Yeah.
[162:03.97]Okay.
[162:04.11]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[162:05.59]Auto guide gadget.
[162:06.43]What is that?
[162:19.38]You may have noticed that objects move more freely here in edit mode than in the home space.
[162:24.45]That's because their auto guide gadgets are disabled by default in the guides menu.
[162:29.27]Okay, well fine.
[162:30.05]I'll explain more about this in another tutorial.
[162:33.03]But for now, you don't need to worry about it.
[162:36.11]It just means you have more freedom to dream shape.
[162:41.07]When the platform is in the right spot, you're ready for the next step.
[162:44.95]Okay.
[162:46.98]And that next step is to play it.
[162:51.52]Alright, hold on, hold on.
[162:57.29]Guys, I'm gonna level with you here.
[163:01.43]Because I have to do these, it's probably gonna take at least three, it's probably gonna take at least two or three hours to do these tutorials, right?
[163:07.36]So here's the plan.
[163:08.38]Okay, here's what's gonna happen.
[163:10.02]I am going to, I'm going to do the tutorial off stream.
[163:23.32]Because this is probably going to be a solid like two plus maybe three hours to do this all.
[163:30.54]So here's the deal.
[163:33.65]I'm going to go pee.
[163:36.33]I'm going to play this tomorrow.
[163:37.53]We're going to make something tomorrow.
[163:40.57]When I turn the stream off tonight, I'm going to do all these.
[163:43.17]I'm going to spend like four, whatever, three, four, five plus hours doing it.
[163:46.70]And then we're going to make something.
[163:47.68]And I'm going to have all the knowledge.
[163:50.96]I'm going to be prepared completely.
[163:55.27]So tomorrow, we will play the creation portion of Dreams.
[164:00.63]For the remainder of today, because it's been about three hours, we can either go back and do some more Dreams, change over to Sam and Max, finish that third episode,
[164:28.62]But you will see I'm going to be making stuff tomorrow.
[164:33.98]I'll give you a poll.
[164:37.68]Because I can definitely foresee that this is going to take a large chunk of time.
[164:42.52]And I know people don't really want to watch tutorials.
[164:45.44]Maybe you do.
[164:46.62]But I'd rather just come and have a bunch of stuff to have for you tomorrow.
[164:51.23]You know what I mean?
[164:53.63]We'll see.
[164:54.33]I could be wrong here.
[164:55.09]So let's find out.
[164:55.73]I'm going to put a poll in the chat.
[165:10.25]I'll give you some good options.
[165:25.81]Okay, here we go.
[165:28.05]I am extraordinarily excited for this game, but I want to know what I'm doing.
[165:35.20]There you go.
[165:35.84]I'm going to just go pee.
[165:36.52]I'm going to take my first break.
[165:38.45]We'll see what you guys want to do.
[165:39.69]I will be right back.
[165:41.25]Stay tuned.
[170:28.27]Alright.
[170:28.87]Hey, how are we doing?
[170:33.24]We are... Are we too close to call right here?
[170:36.50]400 to... Within 1%.
[171:05.09]off of goddamn tutorial voters three if alright this is this I might have to just remove the tutorials one then but it's just the top two because if that this is with now this is within six this is within six votes
[171:34.27]Maybe you'd be inclined to vote for Sam and Max or surfing if you didn't want me to do these tutorials.
[171:38.80]I don't know.
[171:44.28]Alright, let's eliminate the tutorials then.
[171:54.19]You guys, you guys always have, you guys always do this, it's too close.
[171:58.83]It's 4, like, look at this, 427, 428, 430 to 430?
[172:05.75]Do you see how close this is every time?
[172:07.79]Look at this.
[172:15.96]The division here.
[172:16.94]Alright.
[172:17.32]New poll.
[172:18.04]We're getting rid of tutorials.
[172:24.40]And this is it.
[172:28.96]I'm going to call this Dream Surfing or Salmon Max.
[172:33.40]You know what they are.
[172:45.00]The title is required.
[172:46.06]Oh, shit.
[172:46.34]There you go.
[172:55.60]This one's not going to be as long.
[172:59.00]This one's going to be, like, less than two minutes.
[173:04.41]JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[173:06.65]Thanks for the five community subs.
[173:08.17]Thank you.
[173:20.01]Because right now, if I go back, I'm looking at the first poll.
[173:28.72]The first poll has... 42 to 41%.
[173:32.00]Not the tie.
[173:42.51]I'm gonna finish Sam & Max Episode 3, so don't worry.
[173:44.87]I'm gonna do the whole season.
[173:56.20]Another five community subs for Jerma lied about Ace Attorney.
[173:59.66]I don't... These are a bunch of things that I haven't lied about.
[174:05.38]Why don't I just make Sam and Max in Dreams?
[174:09.88]Alright, I'm closing this in ten seconds.
[174:13.77]It looks like by a very small amount we are going to stay in Dreams and we're going to Dream Surf for a little while longer.
[174:24.04]Going back to the first poll, Dream Surfing did win this poll here.
[174:29.31]It is currently sitting at 460 to 449 in favor of do more surfing, so it looks like on both polls... Dream Surfing has won.
[174:41.72]Even with the removal of the tutorials.
[174:57.46]Alright, so we're going to go Dream Surfing.
[174:59.06]It's almost by the same amount, too.
[175:15.78]It won both polls by... Alright, let's back it up.
[175:24.31]And those of you that really want to see Sam & Max, do not worry.
[175:27.73]Sam & Max is going to... It'll probably be the day after tomorrow.
[175:34.55]I will probably do Sam & Max on Wednesday.
[175:38.31]It's just what you wanted to see right this second.
[175:43.40]So let's do some more surfing.
[175:53.38]People that wanted the tutorial also wanted dreams.
[175:56.18]That's true.
[175:58.08]But that dream surfing did technically win that first poll.
[176:04.55]It didn't really matter.
[176:05.39]Alright, I'm going to get out of here.
[176:08.51]Let's go back.
[176:16.64]And let's dream surf.
[176:20.87]This time, I'm going to actually look at some of these.
[176:23.67]Because they're... Instead of doing the auto one.
[176:32.35]Battletops.
[176:33.71]Haunted Mansion.
[176:34.59]So this is an entire story.
[176:36.01]Does the thing at the top right mean how many scenes it has?
[176:42.13]What does that mean?
[176:43.14]The second one.
[176:46.06]Dogs Run.
[176:51.84]Solid gears are metal.
[177:00.45]A car drift.
[177:02.69]Jump souls.
[177:03.63]Do you accept the challenge?
[177:04.61]This is nothing for non-dark... This is nothing for non-Dark Souls player.
[177:09.40]You will die very often, but don't give up.
[177:11.24]All obstacles are... I'm doing it.
[177:26.19]Jump Soul.
[177:29.15]How do I even get that in the game?
[177:31.01]I'm doing all these tutorials.
[177:32.73]My controller's making all kinds of fucked up noises right now.
[177:41.99]I'm about to find your soul with this thing.
[177:50.14]Resurrection.
[177:50.78]Is it a side-scroller?
[177:56.79]Respawn.
[178:01.17]So this is just, they just jump.
[178:03.53]Okay, they disappear.
[178:07.58]Did they say this was easy for Dark Souls players or hard for Dark Souls players?
[178:13.06]This is hard for non-Dark Souls players.
[178:17.79]Right?
[178:18.27]But how does this have to do with Dark Souls?
[178:23.53]Oh, internet's dying here.
[178:46.09]Oh, the internet's forsaking us.
[178:48.55]The internet's dying!
[178:50.23]Noooo!
[178:53.09]Fox is pissed.

[179:16.33]Nooo!
[179:16.89]Why are we, why is this happening?
[179:18.86]I don't see the passes.
[179:22.10]How do you jump over that?
[179:40.37]Oh god.
[179:50.94]CoxCEO in chat.
[179:52.56]He's just sitting there.
[179:53.58]He wanted me to finish Sam & the Max episode 3.
[179:56.82]Bad boy.
[179:59.26]I'll turn it on if you go back to shit, Max.
[180:03.76]Alright, this is like... This is insane.
[180:11.65]The hitbox is so large on that thing.
[180:16.17]Well, I can't wait.
[180:18.96]Sorry, I'm not paying attention.
[180:19.92]I'm paying attention to my dogshit internet.
[180:21.58]I can stand on this one.
[180:31.63]At least I got the dog.
[180:41.01]There we go.
[180:41.65]Alright.
[180:42.21]I'm a souls veteran.
[180:43.15]Oh, fuck.
[180:44.61]Oh, no.
[180:46.15]Why do I have to go all the way back here?
[180:54.19]Is that 500 times?
[180:54.99]No, I haven't.
[180:56.37]Oh wait, it's not that mean.
[180:57.13]Alright, I did it.
[181:10.52]What?
[181:15.50]Jump Solve.
[181:25.95]Alright, I'm about to next this one.
[181:28.61]It's really- it's good, but- okay, nevermind, I'm good.
[181:33.21]That wasn't fair, I couldn't even see where it was from.
[181:35.57]Okay, I'm gonna go fast, though.
[181:58.92]How do I get out of here?
[182:07.96]Exit creation.
[182:14.28]Very fast.
[182:16.70]How do I get out of here?
[182:18.66]Reset progress scoreboard or continue.
[182:22.63]Send to follow creator report.
[182:27.07]Oh, I said circle.
[182:29.94]A Night in Paris.
[182:32.06]What's this one?
[182:37.20]We're gonna play A Night in Paris.
[182:44.69]Oh shit, that's me.
[182:52.22]Hey, what you guys don't even know, I'm off stream here.
[182:54.46]I'm gonna make a fucking ton of things.
[182:57.68]I'm gonna spend all night making things in Dreams.
[183:00.30]You guys don't even know what you're gonna see tomorrow.
[183:07.84]Is that it?
[183:08.24]Am I just like a lost chipmunk?
[183:13.64]I don't get it.
[183:15.97]It's very pretty.
[183:26.18]Have the viewers make fan games?
[183:28.86]No, that'd be, yeah, that'd be awesome.
[183:30.66]Is there a way we can set up, like, a playlist for that?
[183:35.18]Does anybody have this?
[183:35.92]Who has this?
[183:46.31]Not me.
[183:46.81]No, no.
[183:47.69]Well, maybe if somebody has it, we can... Oh, there's a prize here.
[183:50.57]Oh, well.
[183:52.21]Minecraft?
[183:54.57]Minecraft?
[183:57.22]2D platformer based on the good old pixel art games and the 8 and 16-bit eras.
[184:01.44]I'm always updating, but you still find glitches.
[184:03.22]Let's try it.
[184:03.68]Oh, this looks cool.
[184:12.42]Level 1.
[184:12.68]Wait, what is this?
[184:19.94]Collect coins and find bubbles.
[184:21.63]Kill blue enemies by jumping on them.
[184:27.00]I'm gonna make a game like this.
[184:28.56]I'm gonna make... Oh, I can't wait.
[184:32.14]Is this a double jump?
[184:45.51]Sounds dangerous.
[184:46.36]No way for us to screen them.
[184:47.82]I don't think you can put anything up here that would be considered bad.
[184:55.49]Demon's Penance teaser.
[184:58.67]Poster for an upcoming game.
[185:02.29]What?
[185:04.08]How did you do this?
[185:12.96]Is that like elaborate painting tools?
[185:15.40]I just took a sip out of my coffee and I swallowed like four hairs.
[185:28.87]This is awesome.
[185:31.42]I miss Slayer Scrolls.
[185:36.79]Read me.
[185:37.81]Hello, everyone.
[185:38.47]Some of you are asking if my Book of the Dragon puzzle scene will be a part of a bigger project.
[185:43.78]To be honest, I was just learning sculpting tools and testing how detailed I can go with the art in Dreams.
[185:48.66]Still in a phase of exploring different techniques and getting used to making things here.
[185:52.40]Results are quite satisfying, and your wonderful response exceeded my expectations.
[185:56.22]Beta will be over soon, but our adventure in Dreams is just getting started.
[186:01.89]Writing, uh, what you're looking at right now is the very first artwork for the game.
[186:05.41]Adventure, uh, youtube.com slash me.
[186:13.92]I'm never gonna be this good.
[186:19.10]Beach pool.
[186:20.98]You can make pool?
[186:22.00]No, how about toilet simulator?
[186:34.86]to play this one.
[186:35.52]Best idea.
[186:37.38]Early access.
[186:40.31]Bite size up.
[186:42.09]Leave.
[186:43.89]Turn off the light.
[186:46.07]Previous next music.
[186:47.09]Nope.
[186:47.51]Wait.
[187:08.56]Hi, welcome to 2025.
[187:11.05]Just kidding.
[187:12.03]It's expensive.
[187:12.89]Just expensive toilet.
[187:14.09]Oh, wait a minute.
[187:15.33]Hold on a second.
[187:16.23]What did I just look at?
[187:20.31]What did I just see?
[187:20.87]I don't know what that was.
[187:39.21]God damn it This is 2500 thumbs up The rake what could go wrong?
[187:56.15]What's this one?
[188:01.27]Points lost
[188:07.33]That's it.
[188:08.63]IQ points lost.
[188:17.54]What, is this the whole goal here?
[188:18.98]There's nothing else here besides stepping on Rick.
[188:35.50]Temple treasure hunt
[188:38.62]Button Smashing?
[188:39.88]Alright, let's try Button Smasher.
[188:47.54]Button Smasher.
[188:48.42]Score.
[188:49.40]Press X to start.
[188:51.20]Speed.
[188:52.02]Buttons per second.
[188:57.84]Oh, I get it.
[189:08.46]Two buttons.
[189:11.58]No, you can't mash.
[189:23.91]It only takes one input at a time.
[189:25.17]It's not called button masher.
[189:26.91]It's called button smasher.
[189:27.85]Get it right.
[189:37.08]That's pretty good.
[189:44.01]Okay, I can't do this anymore.
[189:45.11]I'm done.
[189:45.35]That was cool, though.
[189:49.29]Flappy Bird.
[189:59.04]It even has it through the speakers.
[190:01.01]This is- Okay, this is a lot different than the original Flappy Bird.
[190:03.75]It's blo- It's floating.
[190:16.47]This is a boomer game.
[190:17.51]This is NOT a boomer game.
[190:22.27]This is the shit that kids were playing at their desk in middle school, like, less than 5-10 years ago.
[190:29.13]A boomer game.
[190:32.25]Kids were getting, like, in trouble in school because of this game.
[190:38.13]Guys, boomers- that implies boomers know how to use their phones.
[190:41.55]Or any device that's electronically powered.
[190:53.03]No, this is like, this is like an early millennial, I mean like late millennial zoomer, right?
[191:05.50]Yes, yes it is.
[191:09.20]The boomer equivalent of this, guys, is like a crossword puzzle.
[191:16.96]Yeah, I get to get at least five.
[191:18.74]Oh my fucking god.
[191:20.03]I can't believe I just did that.
[191:21.07]Whatever.
[191:21.39]One more.
[191:30.93]Now, Picross is not a boomer game either.
[191:42.89]Alright, I got it, I got it.
[191:44.59]That's gonna get to ten.
[191:45.51]Okay, now I'm done.
[191:46.51]Six is fine.
[191:55.40]Hurdle Wars.
[191:58.76]A nod at the classic button-mashing Olympic-style game.
[192:01.93]Stop killing my internet!
[192:08.01]God, I take like a vacation and I come back and the internet's worse than ever.
[192:24.40]Hurdle Wars.
[192:27.83]If this is a button masher, I can do it pretty well.
[192:32.87]Why did I move somewhere with such shitty internet?
[192:34.69]Internet is awful across the entire country of the United States.
[192:38.35]The United States has just shitty... It doesn't matter where you go.
[192:43.03]Everybody complains about it.
[192:44.23]Internet's terrible everywhere.
[192:45.21]There's like four internet companies in America.
[192:50.97]All of them suck.
[192:52.25]They're all terrible.
[192:54.63]There's Cox, Spectrum, Comcast, and like CenturyLink.
[192:59.43]There's like four companies in the whole entire country.
[193:04.45]Pick which one.
[193:05.15]They're all awful.
[193:05.90]It doesn't matter where you go.
[193:07.16]And there's like Google Fiber in like four places.
[193:13.50]Or Verizon Fios in like three places.
[193:28.92]But that's the thing about internet, right?
[193:30.00]Let's do an internet rant here.
[193:32.94]Sometimes you see people that say, what are you talking about?
[193:34.58]My internet's fine.
[193:36.24]I mean, but you're probably not noticing it, right?
[193:39.18]So what you get to see when you watch like a stream is a live feed of how bad their internet is.
[193:45.37]It's just a consistent online feed of that person's internet.
[193:51.48]There's no way to tell how bad or slow your internet could be running sometimes because, I mean, my internet's still on.
[193:59.12]I could go to a website right now just fine.
[194:02.10]But the way that it goes through the cables and to the plant and out to the nodes, and I think I'm off.
[194:14.95]I think it turned off.
[194:26.84]So, it's not... How do I jump?
[194:28.82]Okay, L1 is jump.
[194:37.63]I'm going as fast as I can possibly go.
[194:39.31]I can only go 10.
[194:44.01]I can't go higher than 10.
[194:58.64]Does this end?
[195:00.82]I did it.
[195:01.82]Eight penalties.
[195:02.52]That's not bad.
[195:16.95]Like, speed does not mean stability.
[195:19.63]And that's the problem.
[195:20.61]American Internet, it's actually, you know, fairly fast.
[195:24.31]But it's not stable.
[195:27.57]Really, anywhere you go.
[195:29.68]Some people luck out.
[195:30.52]Some people get really, really, really stable internet.
[195:33.52]But most people have at some point issues with stability.
[195:40.97]Oh, pinball.
[195:41.47]I want to try this.
[195:48.34]Oh, this is awesome.
[195:49.42]I want to make my own.
[196:00.17]Can I shake it?
[196:00.73]I don't think I can tilt it.
[196:03.21]No, this is a real boomer game.
[196:08.13]Yeah, you just bring like $40 and quarters to the arcade.
[196:36.70]workarounds you have to do just to get this to work.
[196:38.72]I'm sure it's fun.
[196:42.66]Uh-oh.
[196:44.04]Alright, that was cool.
[196:45.60]Let's change the channel.
[196:54.99]The Adventures of... I thought that said Seinfeld for a second.
[196:57.53]I was like, what?
[197:01.81]My four-year-old told me a story, so we made it into a game.
[197:04.59]What is a penis pot?
[197:11.25]What?
[197:13.15]Let's find out what that is.
[197:14.07]I need to get in because I want to be burned.
[197:23.69]And I don't want to be hated.
[197:27.07]So, I want you to be despite...
[197:42.39]What?
[197:52.03]Why is it called the penis pot?
[197:55.00]Why is it exploding?
[197:56.84]What did you put in there?
[198:00.08]You put like utensils in there.
[198:06.49]Open.
[198:13.44]I gotta get... I'm going in the water.
[198:25.19]I didn't listen to the story.
[198:26.45]Yes, I did.
[198:26.95]It was too full.
[198:27.63]But the other planet's top had yachts hovering.
[198:37.40]Oh, okay.
[198:42.19]So did the pea go into the panda's pot?
[198:44.25]Is that what that thing's called?
[198:46.94]Yeah.
[198:48.44]The end?
[198:48.80]Yeah.
[198:50.46]Whee!
[198:51.64]And then did someone eat it?
[198:52.48]Did it get cooked?
[198:54.10]Did somebody come over and eat this?
[198:56.24]Well, the panda's pot and the pea mixed up.
[199:00.54]What's that mean?
[199:02.53]The pea got thrown away at the panda's pot.
[199:09.13]Why is there one of them that's big?
[199:10.63]That's an apple.
[199:18.60]What was that recorded on, is what I want to know.
[199:22.18]That was not a cell phone.
[199:25.36]That was like an old honk-a-phone from the 20s.
[199:28.33]That's what it sounded like.
[199:30.49]Alright, I'm gonna have to give thumbs up to Payne's Pop.
[199:40.50]Llama Quest.
[199:42.71]We already did this one, didn't we?
[199:48.83]Hold on a minute.

[201:04.88]What is it loading?
[201:13.14]Is this going to get to a hundred?
[201:20.76]What?!
[201:23.96]Oh, this is definitely not allowed.
[201:26.12]This is definitely not okay.

[202:26.34]I would have went to the, uh, flying level.
[202:28.50]Is this gonna go... This is a one-to-one remake.
[202:47.01]Come on.
[202:47.61]No, I can't get it.
[202:49.83]Wait, wait, wait.
[202:56.57]This is, this is a guay.
[202:57.79]Everyone that's asking.
[202:59.01]How did I get in here?
[203:00.65]Wait, wait, wait.
[203:03.75]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[203:06.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[203:18.38]I mean, this is pretty well done.
[203:22.32]Can I go down?
[203:26.26]There's no actual levels, but this is a fully redone Super Mario 64, N64 Mario.
[203:34.16]Let me go check something else.
[203:37.08]Alright, I think I gotta get out of here.

[204:35.06]They actually made it, didn't they?
[204:44.97]No way.
[204:47.97]Where am I?
[204:51.71]Why am I huge?
[204:56.41]What's with the camera?
[204:59.58]I'm fucking enormous.
[205:03.62]I'm like 45 feet tall.
[205:13.49]I gotta get to the top of the mountain.
[205:20.21]Get up there!
[205:20.83]Come on!
[205:22.53]Go!
[205:23.07]This is so cool.
[205:33.84]This is great.
[205:35.06]It's unfortunate that this is probably going to get removed in, like, three days.
[205:38.02]Uh oh.
[205:48.64]Oh no, there it is.
[205:51.04]There's the T-Force.
[205:52.25]We found it.
[205:53.23]We found it.
[205:53.89]I don't want to thumbs this up because I don't want to be associated with like the illegal activity, right?
[205:59.21]I mean, it's pretty cool.
[206:03.89]Crabman, Destroyer of Worlds.
[206:05.75]We have to play Crabman.
[206:17.39]Crab man demo.
[206:19.03]Demo?
[206:19.75]I don't know.
[206:21.00]It could be anything.
[206:25.20]Let's stick to run.
[206:26.60]Punch all four umbrellas to begin.
[206:28.22]Walk over crabs to collect them.
[206:29.66]Press X button to jump.
[206:31.84]Square button to punch.
[206:34.63]Okay, collect as many crabs as you can under the time limit.
[206:38.83]The more things you destroy, the faster crab man will go.
[206:51.78]Alright, we ready?
[206:55.00]Go!
[207:08.05]I can't destroy the wall?
[207:09.41]What about, can I punch the building?
[207:11.65]Cars?
[207:27.37]I thought I was gonna go faster, the more things I broke.
[207:29.27]Uh-oh, I fell off.
[207:35.51]I didn't get crabs.
[207:39.25]How many are on the level?
[207:40.66]Get the crab, get the... I just got... I just got fucking destroyed.
[207:46.98]I just got detached.
[207:50.56]All of my spinal discs came out.
[208:04.98]Just you wait.
[208:05.52]Just wait till tomorrow.
[208:07.48]When I have my games.
[208:08.32]When I have my videos and my artwork.
[208:10.50]I'm going to do a whole showcase.
[208:12.78]I'm not fucking around.
[208:14.04]I'm going to spend all night.
[208:16.02]I'm not even going to sleep.
[208:18.99]Tomorrow's stream is going to be fucked.
[208:20.99]Because I'm going to go on no sleep and just show you all my fucked up shit that I made.
[208:34.75]Mr. Crab?
[208:35.45]It's alright.
[208:37.59]Mr. Crab.
[208:39.13]Mr. Crab.
[208:41.07]Mr. Crabs.
[208:42.63]Hey, you Mr. Crabs.
[208:44.38]I'm... It's already starting to happen.
[208:45.60]I'm already getting weird.
[208:57.35]It's alright.
[208:57.65]Even if I stay up too late and I puke on stream, I'll just mute.
[208:59.95]You won't even know I did it.
[209:04.41]Can I play basketball?
[209:08.40]I wonder if I can play basketball.
[209:10.18]No.
[209:13.32]Did you enjoy that?
[209:14.18]Crabman, destroyer of worlds.
[209:16.18]Yes, I did.
[209:21.25]Comet grab.
[209:22.89]Too complicated.
[209:28.17]Cat nav.
[209:29.78]Global game jam to help lost cats find their way home.
[209:43.08]Look at this description.
[209:51.81]New Year's resolutions!
[209:53.57]Star Wars, oh!
[209:54.89]What if I remade Star Wars?
[210:01.86]Follow me.
[210:04.68]Duck quacks don't echo.
[210:10.68]This is literally used in the context of me liking soy milk.
[210:15.28]Alright, we have to do this one.
[210:18.90]Alright, we'll play the soy boy after this.
[210:24.33]Duck RPM.
[210:26.33]Hold the flashing yellow buttons until the duck rotates past the megaphone.
[210:33.83]Hold the...
[210:48.23]How do I increase the duck's RPM?
[210:49.75]This is... this is stupid.
[210:51.29]But it's, like, fun.
[210:53.29]Oh, I see, it's slowly going up.
[211:17.01]People would get trickled in with the complaining WarioWare or something.
[211:45.48]Is 27.5 the highest it can go?
[211:49.38]No.
[211:49.54]At what point do I just stop doing this?
[211:53.14]Never.
[211:53.96]It's gonna get probably too fast for me to even react.
[212:22.82]What?
[212:23.86]Whoa, whoa, I broke his face.
[212:25.39]No, no, no, no, no.
[212:26.21]What are you doing?
[212:32.83]Alright, I just kind of wanted to get out of that.
[212:40.60]He ruined it.
[212:41.38]It's fine.
[212:41.88]Project Dead.
[212:43.98]This is a short concept demo showing some ambient and style I might use in a future game.
[212:48.12]That's creepy.
[212:48.68]That was all sculpted?
[212:51.70]Otto's Misadventure in the Wonderverse!
[212:53.98]I have to play this one.
[213:07.94]Alright, Orb Thingy, 0 out of 10.
[213:17.57]He's in retro mode.
[213:19.13]What the hell?
[213:19.99]I can do voices?
[213:21.27]Press R2 mid-jump to perform a stomp attack.
[213:51.98]It's hard to control.
[213:59.26]What?
[214:06.43]Why is it blinking?
[214:08.03]What the fuck just happened?
[214:10.12]What just happened to me?
[214:20.09]Stomp attack.
[214:20.69]I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[214:21.82]I get it, I get it, I get it.
[214:24.68]I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[214:26.26]Oh, shit.
[214:32.32]Um... Uh... Okay.
[214:35.20]Is there an attack button?
[214:53.64]He doesn't know.
[214:54.56]You don't know either.
[214:55.50]Hold R1 while approaching branching pathways.
[215:04.52]Oh, this is cool.
[215:06.11]Should I go in the cave?
[215:21.65]He doesn't know.
[215:24.30]Neither do I. None of us do.
[215:33.37]Telepooch?
[215:43.40]What did he say?
[215:51.83]He's doing the Chad walk.
[215:54.61]I mean, not really.
[215:56.54]Not really.
[216:01.12]No, he's not.
[216:08.33]T-U-R-S.
[216:10.53]This looks nice, though.
[216:11.45]This is really well made.
[216:12.29]Let's go this way.
[216:20.11]I can't jump from them?
[216:22.08]Why not?
[216:23.38]Oh, I have to... I have to actually stomp them.
[216:26.74]Thought I could just Mario them.
[216:28.16]Oh, I need ten of these.
[216:45.13]No, that's not the Chad.
[216:46.29]That's just your arms don't have bones.
[216:50.48]Move on to soy.
[216:52.46]No Wizard
[217:15.96]Why are you laughing at me?
[217:20.78]Stop laughing at me!
[217:22.83]Oh come on, man.
[217:25.15]Okay, okay, I get it.
[217:27.15]Go ahead.
[217:30.01]Is there somebody else I can talk to, please?
[217:36.64]I didn't make this.
[217:38.26]Nope.
[217:45.73]What do I do?
[217:46.13]What do I do?
[217:46.73]Don't die.
[217:47.47]I died.
[217:49.87]What do I do?
[217:52.97]What do I do?
[217:53.39]What do I do?
[217:56.37]Is the scarecrow still talking?
[218:01.34]What's going on?
[218:01.96]Is this Zeus?
[218:04.68]Is Zeus fighting me too?
[218:06.50]How did I get back here?
[218:10.70]What the hell is going on?
[218:16.59]Yeah, this really is.
[218:17.83]Somebody just said this is like a new grounds game.
[218:19.53]What am I supposed to do?
[218:20.65]The power of Zeus compels you.
[218:22.35]I do what I do.
[218:25.75]What do I do?
[218:40.16]Oh, no.
[218:40.60]Zeus is dead.
[218:41.58]The hell?
[218:42.76]The wizard is blowing himself up.
[218:44.10]Oh, this does not feel good.
[218:48.50]I don't think I can do anything about that.
[218:54.35]What do I do?
[218:54.79]What do I do?
[218:55.21]What do I do?
[218:55.55]What do I do?
[218:56.07]Is it an orb right here?
[219:03.36]Can I not jump up here?
[219:07.18]Of course I can.
[219:12.19]Thanks for playing.
[219:12.83]More to come.
[219:13.38]Turn back to continue hunting orb thingies.
[219:15.70]Continue to save score.
[219:24.53]Missed eight.
[219:25.25]Yeah, well, I'm a...
[219:45.43]How am I supposed to jump over that?
[219:47.59]This is where the oof comes in.
[219:52.09]I can't get over it.
[219:54.77]There we go.
[219:55.77]Soy!
[219:56.01]I'll play Soy after.
[219:57.51]Just wait.
[219:59.53]A pipe?
[220:00.69]No, come on.
[220:07.92]That's bullshit.
[220:21.22]There's no way for me to beat this?
[220:27.19]I can't win.
[220:27.65]He's actually blocking the path to the end.
[220:35.51]Oh, is that easy?
[220:49.37]I'll get out of the way.
[220:59.06]You did it!
[220:59.52]Now try again.
[221:00.22]Your time was bad.
[221:01.46]Oh.
[221:01.68]Alright.
[221:16.41]I hope I don't fucking regret this.
[221:18.23]Yummy, do you enjoy your... your changed track?
[221:26.97]This is what it is.
[221:27.49]This is it.
[221:29.75]It's actually just a thing of soy milk.
[221:31.65]That's it.
[221:31.97]There's nothing here.
[221:51.53]Well, there you go.
[221:52.39]That was bad.
[221:53.01]That was alright.
[221:53.91]It's the soy boy.
[221:59.45]There's a soy OST.
[222:00.65]What else we got?
[222:03.15]Bug report?
[222:06.83]There's nothing.
[222:07.41]Okay.
[222:08.87]Beatman.
[222:10.45]Gold Valley.
[222:11.25]Pig Detective.
[222:12.21]Season 0.
[222:14.28]The first adventure of Pig Detective.
[222:15.70]Your friendly neighborhood private investigator who is also a pig.
[222:18.04]I mean, we kind of have to see what this is.
[222:21.55]Beware, these are the dark ages of Pig Detective, also known as Beta.
[222:26.41]A time when the creator didn't know shit and the clever game mechanics were the last thing he learned.
[222:31.45]Proceed at your own risk and don't fret.
[222:33.22]There will be a better gameplay in the future.
[222:40.00]Okay, so, Pig Detective.
[222:45.62]No, shit.
[222:46.30]No, no, no, go back, back, back.
[222:56.88]Yeah, this is Sam and Max.
[223:03.76]It's a mouse?
[223:05.14]It really is Sam and Max.
[223:07.26]Hello, pig detective.
[223:09.46]Any news about the case?
[223:18.29]Wednesday.
[223:26.03]This is BioShock Infinite.
[223:28.13]This is what happens in BioShock Infinite, right?
[223:31.76]Don't you like a flashback?
[223:33.02]If somebody has a flashback to being a detective?
[223:35.72]I don't know.
[223:36.04]Whatever this is.
[223:41.80]Are you the famous pig detective?
[223:49.46]Oh, I have to answer.
[223:55.06]Um, no.
[223:57.53]You use a flashback.
[223:58.67]You get no say in this.
[224:02.97]I'm Gloria.
[224:03.61]I own the Cheese Palace.
[224:05.45]How can I help you?
[224:07.41]My bouncer, Butch, he got arrested.
[224:10.37]But he is innocent and the best bouncer in town.
[224:14.67]Case accepted.
[224:17.53]He just got spawned in.
[224:21.83]Um, alright, cheese.
[224:24.05]I brought you cheese.
[224:26.75]What a pathetic try to pick up a mouse.
[224:30.82]Have you talked to Butch?
[224:31.46]I have not talked to Butch.
[224:33.36]He is at the police station, remember?
[224:38.24]Before you go, leave the cheese on the table.
[224:43.40]Can I go in the bath?
[224:47.74]I am just kind of naked, aren't I?
[224:50.77]Alright, any items to pick up?
[224:53.06]Cheese.
[224:53.38]Alright, there you go.
[224:56.74]Why did that... I just turned on a button.
[224:58.12]The cheese was the button to open the elevator.
[225:05.82]That's a duck.
[225:11.97]Cheese Palace.
[225:16.65]Look at how cool this looks.
[225:21.82]Rat hole and pub.
[225:23.08]Rat hole and pub, you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
[225:29.56]Go in.
[225:30.02]It really is Sam and Mac.
[225:43.43]Sorry, the cat is a bit buggy since the beta.
[225:46.93]This doesn't affect the gameplay.
[225:52.72]Officer Cat.
[225:55.62]Who is in there?
[225:56.46]It's the Cat Police.
[226:02.82]I need to talk to Butch.
[226:09.32]Visiting hour is over, buddy.
[226:13.21]And I'm not in a good mood, so please go away.
[226:17.51]Go away.
[226:21.08]Step away from the cell.
[226:22.42]I wanna talk to Bush.
[226:25.58]Probably have to get a donut or something.
[226:30.36]I need a donut or something that a cat likes.
[226:35.51]Cats don't like cheese, right?
[226:45.38]Get the mouse?
[226:49.16]Cats like cheese, sometimes.
[226:52.03]Can I pick up a rat?
[226:52.79]I don't think I can pick anybody up.
[226:59.35]Donuts.
[226:59.73]There we go.
[227:06.92]These people are terrifying.
[227:11.20]Donuts!
[227:12.62]Good evening, Jack.
[227:15.06]Give me a box of them donuts.
[227:18.44]Okay.
[227:19.64]Thank you.
[227:22.97]You too, Jack.
[227:23.69]Have a good day.
[227:31.22]I wonder if I can record my own voice and put it in here and stuff too.
[227:39.83]Gonna make my own adventure game.
[227:43.79]Do you think I can download and install all the knowledge to be able to do this whole thing in the next 24 hours?
[227:51.81]I ain't going to bed.
[227:52.87]I'm going to lose my fucking mind.
[227:58.76]Go talk to the prisoner if you want.
[228:00.08]Okay.
[228:12.07]Gloria sends me.
[228:15.09]You have to get me out of here.
[228:16.13]I ain't done nothing.
[228:18.83]Tell me what happened.
[228:20.72]Okay.
[228:22.82]One night, I come to work and the police is already there.
[228:25.64]They say I have stolen from Mr. Cromwell.
[228:32.22]But I never... I don't even know Mr. Cromwell.
[228:35.85]You have to believe me, pig detective.
[228:37.77]Time to visit Mr. Cromwell.
[228:46.81]I am just realizing right now.
[228:50.17]What the fuck I'm playing?
[228:52.41]This is absolutely bizarre.
[228:58.91]Where's Mr. Cromwell?
[229:00.41]Mr. Cromwell.
[229:01.23]Is he a taxi cab driver?
[229:21.72]I don't know why my voice did that, too.
[229:23.00]Is he a taxi cab driver?!
[229:27.18]Alright, Mr. Cromwell.
[229:33.78]Cromwell Manor.
[229:34.68]There's a lot of content here for this being... We haven't even seen any of the loading screens.
[229:44.31]It's a long walk, though.
[229:50.93]That's really far away.
[229:56.30]Anybody there?
[230:07.12]Uh, this is... Interesting.
[230:15.01]I have to go track him down?
[230:16.49]Puzzle?
[230:17.61]Puzzle?
[230:18.11]What am I doing with- I don't know why I'm doing that.
[230:24.93]Is he a bird?
[230:25.79]Owl?
[230:26.63]Pigeon?
[230:29.21]Snowman?
[230:34.15]I'm Pig Detective, and I'm investigating the case.
[230:37.40]I'm Mr. Cromwell.
[230:38.44]What case?
[230:39.82]Well, you say I hear you were robbed.
[230:42.36]A formidable crime.
[230:44.20]My most prized possession, gone.
[230:46.50]It was stolen from my safe in this very house.
[230:51.95]Yeah, well, let me see about that.
[230:58.23]Well, I, oh.
[231:01.47]I meant to find out who did it.
[231:02.41]The culprit has already been found.
[231:06.43]My client is not so sure about that.
[231:07.89]Who was your client?
[231:13.20]That's for me to know and for you to find out, partner.
[231:16.24]Wouldn't you expect me to help with your investigation?
[231:20.60]Was that really wise?
[231:22.06]Was that really wise?
[231:24.47]It is that mouse who owns the cheese palace, right?
[231:27.10]Worried for her.
[231:28.90]Mind if I look around the house?
[231:31.57]If you really can't help yourself, I'll be in the music room.
[231:49.34]I have no idea how to build an inventory.
[231:53.55]Inventory.
[231:54.17]I have no idea how to build an inventory.
[231:57.13]If you want to know what you have, write it down.
[232:04.05]That's amazing.
[232:07.43]At least they're honest.
[232:15.89]That's so funny.
[232:17.73]Piece of paper with a paw print.
[232:29.27]Write that down.
[232:31.57]Matchbook.
[232:33.31]Piece of paper with a paw print.
[232:35.43]Piece of paper with a paw print.
[232:37.09]Say that five times fast.
[232:38.74]Piece of paper with a paw print.
[232:39.62]Got it.
[233:01.18]Bird.
[233:02.40]Nice birdie, hello birdie.
[233:06.02]Fatagon and fatag- fatagon.
[233:08.02]Mmm, gazuntite.
[233:09.92]Is that a clue?
[233:12.06]Can't do anything with the piano.
[233:33.47]With a dog painting?
[233:35.33]It's an octopus chewing on a mop with wings.
[233:39.43]Okay.
[233:39.65]Where's the last clue?
[233:46.88]The clock?
[233:47.30]I don't think the clock would be a clue.
[234:03.75]Let's say that five times fast.
[234:05.79]I think that the clock could be a clue.
[234:07.03]No, I'm not doing that again.
[234:12.31]Where is... I can't go in this door.
[234:14.27]Oh, no.
[234:15.01]Yeah, I can.
[234:15.39]Alright, here we go.
[234:19.66]Fruit on the table.
[234:22.28]No.
[234:22.54]Fireplace?
[234:25.24]It is a letter too burnt for reading, but clearly signed by Mr. Sharky.
[234:33.63]This looks like the QRS house.
[234:36.75]Yeah, it does.
[234:44.54]Mr. Cromwell, I have something for you.
[234:46.14]I've finished snooping around.
[234:48.46]Can I ask you a few questions?
[234:51.32]I suppose you must.
[234:54.78]Rat hole.
[234:55.32]Mr. Sharky.
[234:56.12]Paw print.
[234:56.64]Bird in a cage.
[234:58.02]Bird in a cage.
[235:00.05]That is a pretty bird you have in a cage there.
[235:04.17]Why does everybody go on about the bird in the cage?
[235:08.31]Is it because I am a bird myself?
[235:13.64]What about Mr. Sharky?
[235:15.94]How do you know Mr. Sharky?
[235:18.50]Mr. Sharky, the infamous loan shark.
[235:20.72]I've never heard of him.
[235:22.53]Bullshit.
[235:23.35]I've got a piece of paper with your name on it.
[235:28.81]Nothing is sure of fishy here.
[235:34.16]There was this piece of paper with the paw print in your place.
[235:38.38]The robber left it so everybody would know it was him.
[235:42.75]Common criminals do that kind of thing.
[235:44.13]How else would the police know who to lock up?
[235:46.63]What?
[235:46.79]Have you ever been to the pub called the Rat Hole?
[235:53.06]Of course I do not frequent that wretched hive of scum and villainy.
[235:58.99]You work for a mouse and ask me if I associate with rats?
[236:01.35]You seem to be obsessed with rodents.
[236:04.07]In a way.
[236:05.59]I'm fed up with you right now.
[236:09.17]Give my regards to your mouse!
[236:11.42]Does that mean I'm gonna get shot at or something?
[236:18.42]Is it?
[236:22.87]What just happened?
[236:23.51]Did a missile just drop?
[236:32.97]A meteor just hit Earth.
[236:36.13]We don't seem to care.
[236:36.91]It's called lightning?
[236:44.03]That was not lightning, that was a meteor.
[236:45.78]Alright, rat hole.
[236:55.88]See, can I go in the rat hole?
[237:01.75]I think we're at the end of the locations here.
[237:03.23]Dude, I don't know what it is about.
[237:10.56]I feel like I've seen these mice somewhere before.
[237:19.64]What movie or TV show or game?
[237:21.94]That mouse right there.
[237:23.42]It's freaking me out.
[237:38.36]Barkeep.
[237:39.90]Hello, pig detective.
[237:42.16]Hi, Andrew.
[237:45.58]The Muppets?
[237:46.24]Yeah, I think it's Rizzo the Rat.
[237:48.13]Maybe.
[237:48.43]I want to know about Mr. Cromwell.
[237:56.93]As a bartender, I cannot answer that question.
[237:58.53]What are you, his attorney?
[238:00.19]I don't know.
[238:00.63]You don't expect me to rat on the customers, do you?
[238:12.16]Give me a beer.
[238:24.49]That rushing waterfall.
[238:26.65]He just shotgunned that.
[238:29.07]Hey, pig detective!
[238:30.69]Hold on, let me change this.
[238:33.21]I want to change this from... uh... the Shire... to Renaissance Rats.
[238:46.08]That is renaissance rats.
[238:48.50]Well, how about country rats?
[238:56.52]That's better.
[239:02.91]The rat gang.
[239:04.31]Good evening, gentlemen.
[239:08.27]You need a rat?
[239:13.21]Do you know where the toilet is?
[239:17.38]The toilets.
[239:18.36]Comes here all the time and doesn't know where the ratting loo is.
[239:21.69]He's trying to rat with us.
[239:24.79]He's acting suspicious.
[239:26.25]What are you hiding, mate?
[239:30.85]Have you seen Mr. Cromwell around here?
[239:34.80]Mr. Cromwell, that fancy dude in here?
[239:36.82]You must be joking, mate.
[239:42.84]How do you know who he is, then?
[239:46.90]How do we know?
[239:47.48]He's in the rotten paper, ain't he?
[239:51.62]Got his thing stolen.
[239:53.24]Rotten, expensive thing.
[239:54.44]Should have been us stealing it, right, boys?
[239:56.46]Uh, sure.
[240:00.97]You're right.
[240:04.97]I really need that toilet now.
[240:17.07]Out of order.
[240:20.01]Am I gonna go in the urinal?
[240:21.67]I'm not gonna take something out of the urinal.
[240:25.29]Who the fuck is this?
[240:30.12]Am I about to get murdered by a Final Fantasy character?
[240:33.56]I'm dead!
[240:36.74]Oh, that's it?
[240:46.52]Next morning.
[240:51.44]I'm getting too old for this.
[240:55.18]I drank one beer.
[241:08.96]Is Pig Detective getting too old for this?
[241:11.02]For what?
[241:11.68]And who is the mysterious early morning caller?
[241:17.08]Find out next time.
[241:19.34]In the next installment of Pig Detective, the Uncaped Crusader.
[241:23.94]What a cliffhanger.
[241:24.64]You'll have to find out eventually.
[241:30.75]Thank you for playing so far.
[241:32.03]Thanks for making it.
[241:32.69]That was good.
[241:34.21]Episode zero, come on.
[241:37.87]Coming soon.
[241:38.59]Wait, you can make a wrestling ring?
[241:39.77]Okay.
[241:47.60]Okay, that's all I needed to see.
[241:49.40]In space.
[242:19.20]Anything else coming soon?
[242:20.22]Alright.
[242:20.78]Pig Detective Season Zero.
[242:24.88]Well, wouldn't it be Episode Zero?
[242:27.63]Season Zero.
[242:29.79]Only 871 thumbs up?
[242:31.17]That's not cool.
[242:35.35]Dragon Showcase.
[242:40.77]The Quantum Donut.
[242:42.83]You find a donut, you eat it, it makes you fat.
[242:44.45]It also doesn't.
[242:45.19]Okay.
[242:47.94]Let's see what that is.
[242:55.89]I'm gonna say it before anybody else does.
[242:57.15]It's John from Garfield.
[242:59.01]I said it first.
[243:10.21]I thought I was supposed to eat a donut.
[243:13.42]This just looks like a platformer.
[243:20.86]Okay.
[243:22.88]World's softest mud.
[243:24.60]Am I gonna sink?
[243:37.48]Alright, I guess we just keep going.
[243:39.52]This is down to the donut, I assume.
[243:47.28]There it is.
[243:48.60]It's a donut.
[243:50.76]Eat the donut.
[243:51.44]Free will is an illusion.
[243:52.98]Duh, of course.
[244:01.74]Oh, this guy wants to eat the donut too.
[244:03.52]Did you just eat my quantum donut?
[244:06.70]That doesn't sound like real science.
[244:08.78]Follow me to my secret lab and you'll understand what I mean.
[244:10.56]We're invested now.
[244:33.74]Press square to toggle between fat and skinny.
[244:41.83]Oh shit!
[244:52.08]The Quantum Donut!
[244:53.40]Is that it?
[245:01.61]2B continue.
[245:02.15]Project will be finished when the full game releases.
[245:05.91]Wow skinny jump.
[245:07.59]Hold X while fat to bounce.
[245:13.48]Wow fat to do a speed boost.
[245:15.14]Okay.
[245:15.98]See if you can reach the platforms.
[245:35.37]Probably not.
[245:38.46]No, I want to get out of here.
[245:47.04]Okay.
[245:48.48]Dreams came out a week ago.
[245:50.32]Most are still demos.
[245:51.80]Oh, yeah.
[245:53.25]I'm surprised people have been able to make this stuff already.
[245:57.73]Not even a week and a half later.
[246:00.55]Gork.
[246:01.63]Help Gork to catch his son Jack.
[246:08.67]That is bizarre.
[246:13.65]I'm getting inspiration though.
[246:14.89]That is a big ass.
[246:25.00]That was a pretty huge ass reveal.
[246:45.75]Can I run faster than this?
[246:47.03]Or does it might just... Come on, get up there!
[247:03.48]But, come on, let's be... No, no, no, no, no, go, go, go, go, go.
[247:09.90]You can't tell me I'm not allowed to have a reaction to that.
[247:16.52]This dude's wearing pants like four sizes too small.
[247:25.22]I gotta get up here.
[247:35.52]What is that?
[247:36.96]Is that an animal?
[247:40.14]Is that thing alive?
[247:46.12]That's terrifying.
[247:49.88]It looks like one of the aliens sitting at the bar.
[247:51.76]In Star Wars.
[247:57.09]The cantina.
[247:57.91]Like I have lost sight of his son.
[248:00.71]I have no idea where he is.
[248:02.99]Oh my god, how the fuck am I ever gonna reach him?
[248:07.81]What are you saying?
[248:16.10]This really is a dream.
[248:18.87]This thing would scare the shit out of me in my dream.
[248:24.89]Why does he keep going?
[248:34.67]I'm never gonna catch this thing.
[248:37.23]Where is he going?
[248:38.17]Should I just wait till he comes across?
[248:40.43]Is he gonna go to the volcano?
[248:41.74]I have no idea how to run faster.
[248:49.52]I guess I just have to make it to the volcano.
[248:59.67]Is this Project Spark?
[249:01.63]No, this is actually good.
[249:05.49]It's kind of mean, but...
[249:24.83]What?
[249:25.25]Okay.
[249:27.57]It's funny, because this isn't that good.
[249:33.13]I'm just kidding!
[249:34.01]Project Spark was fine, it was just too complicated.
[249:36.21]I'm dead.
[249:37.75]Alright, we're never gonna catch Gork.
[249:42.99]I'm so close to the volcano.
[249:52.13]No, don't!
[249:56.87]I need a better view.
[250:01.16]Oh, fuck off.
[250:06.06]I'm dead.
[250:15.33]Okay, slow.
[250:16.07]No, I can't.
[250:17.99]I can't go slow.
[250:19.27]Slide off.
[250:19.97]I'm so sick of hearing him do that.
[250:21.55]Okay.
[250:24.83]Now over here.
[250:29.00]Okay.
[250:43.08]And then up here... I'm gonna beat this one.
[250:51.42]Oh, come on.
[250:58.82]God damn it, man.
[251:13.92]I'm invested.
[251:14.44]I have to at least try.
[251:15.30]No, don't do that!
[251:22.72]Put my finger in there?
[251:23.66]I'm not gonna put my finger in there.
[251:31.07]Alright.
[251:34.47]Checkpoint?
[251:35.01]Give me a checkpoint right here.
[251:41.70]Where is this kid?
[251:42.77]What does it say?
[251:44.07]Sorry for any inconvenience, but the volcano was closed due to refurbishment.
[251:53.23]Are those bats?
[251:55.17]Gargoyles?
[252:02.17]Did he go in here?
[252:08.31]Welcome to the volcano.
[252:09.43]Please put any litter in the bins provided.
[252:15.37]There's another portion of this game.
[252:23.14]Did we get the reason why the kid ran away in the first place?
[252:27.22]This is actually pretty cool.
[252:28.02]There he is.
[252:37.65]Do you actually think that Gork has lore?
[252:41.45]I don't know.
[252:42.03]How the fuck am I supposed to know?
[252:52.15]Maybe.
[252:52.53]No, no.
[252:53.22]I went the wrong way.
[252:53.86]Fuck.
[252:56.44]I'm kind of sick of Gork.
[252:57.64]I'm not going to lie.
[253:05.08]But I have to...
[253:13.23]Finish Gork.
[253:16.43]Alright, I will.
[253:19.35]Maybe not.
[253:19.87]It depends.
[253:20.41]If I die like three or four more times, I won't do it.
[253:31.56]Thank god I can start here.
[253:42.27]What am I supposed to do down this way?
[253:44.61]But things moving around.
[253:45.81]You're telling me my four-year-old son did this?
[253:52.96]What?
[254:04.57]Out of all the good games, this is the one to get invested in.
[254:07.77]I did Pig Detective.
[254:09.37]We did that one.
[254:21.63]We need closure.
[254:22.35]We'll get it.
[254:25.31]Alright, I need to go... now.
[254:30.58]And then from... God damn it!
[254:33.32]No!
[254:33.68]This is too much.
[254:52.91]Come on!
[255:01.20]Okay.
[255:03.78]Jump!
[255:06.48]Come on, Gorg!
[255:08.69]I did it!
[255:12.31]Where is he?
[255:13.49]Where's the kid?
[255:17.86]Oh, give me a fucking break, really?
[255:28.31]Can I even jump on this?
[255:34.61]I got saved by frames there.
[255:36.03]The hitboxes didn't trigger there.
[255:42.57]Who knows where the hell this is going to put me if I miss this.
[255:48.01]Oh, that's bad.
[255:51.30]I can't even get up here.
[255:52.44]Dude, this is too hard.
[256:01.38]I can't get...
[256:11.03]Oh, I don't want to do this anymore.
[256:14.19]I really don't want to do it anymore, but I have to.
[256:20.83]This is something that you guys will never stop saying.
[256:28.11]This is gonna be the Floygan Brothers again.
[256:29.71]Shit!
[256:40.85]I'm going backwards?
[256:47.02]What?
[256:51.20]What do you mean I'm going backwards?
[256:52.22]What are you talking about?
[256:53.04]They both look exactly the same.
[257:00.75]I was going backwards?
[257:07.48]What?
[257:16.20]No, I wasn't.
[257:16.86]I was going the right way.
[257:19.30]Right?
[257:25.36]I have no idea.
[257:26.98]You guys just got in my head so hard.
[257:28.66]I don't know if I'm going the right way.
[257:44.34]Where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[257:47.44]Oh my god.
[257:48.30]No!
[257:51.08]Oh god damn it!
[257:59.08]I can't take it anymore.
[258:03.26]No!
[258:20.36]You have to beat Gork.
[258:21.38]You have to finish Gork.
[258:29.55]What?
[258:30.29]Oh.
[258:34.97]It's really easy to fall off this shit.
[258:37.65]Like that, see?
[258:48.38]Who cares about Gork?
[258:50.28]You guys really want to see the end of Gork?
[258:56.94]Nobody does.
[258:57.84]Only maybe two of you do.
[259:06.81]Come on.
[259:10.29]Alright, almost there.
[259:17.93]Okay, stay on it.
[259:29.90]Oh!
[259:30.40]Why?
[259:31.04]What?
[259:31.62]What did it do that for?
[259:32.62]It just...
[259:38.90]why I didn't throw I did yeah oh my god I'm gonna lose my mind over dreams gork no one cares about gork please
[260:04.84]In all capitals.
[260:07.34]Please.
[260:08.72]Please.
[260:11.18]Alright, how did I fuck this up?
[260:12.28]Do I have to jump from here to another one?
[260:13.88]To there?
[260:23.44]See?
[260:24.38]Oh, that's not cool.
[260:25.92]That's not cool.
[260:26.54]I think it just pushes you off.
[260:38.20]Is this the donut one?
[260:39.40]No, it's a different game.
[260:51.37]What the hell am I doing wrong?
[260:58.45]I think I have to jump to that.
[261:08.90]No!
[261:09.54]You stupid crystal!
[261:13.94]Just you wait.
[261:14.38]I'm going to make a game like Gork, and it's going to be Gork 2.
[261:26.36]Alright.
[261:27.02]You just have to stay on it.
[261:27.92]It's really hard to stay on.
[261:33.91]It's already fucking up and trying to kick me off.
[261:37.12]It's like, fuck you!
[261:38.48]It just does the same thing every time!
[261:40.50]No!
[261:43.46]God!
[261:45.82]I had it too!
[261:46.66]I have to see the end of Gork.
[261:50.33]I have to.
[261:55.63]Is this going to be one of those scenarios where I download the Mario Maker level and make it completable?
[262:07.21]Fuck.
[262:07.95]No!
[262:08.79]Why?
[262:09.05]I can't, uh... This is harder than Sekiro.
[262:37.57]Okay, don't fuck it up.
[262:45.29]I have to keep jumping is what has to happen here.
[262:48.71]I gotta jump forward when we get to about right here.
[262:51.81]Forward.
[262:53.07]Forward.
[262:53.53]See how it's trying to do it already?
[262:55.35]Alright, no crystal.
[262:56.71]Don't get hit by the crystal.
[262:58.17]They're starting to distract me a little bit.
[262:59.73]Don't touch.
[263:00.19]See?
[263:00.84]See what happened?
[263:01.36]Come on!

[264:27.71]Was that a... Search the kitchen for a knife and investigate the noise upstairs.
[264:34.71]Um... Found one.
[264:42.65]I love this Dreams because it's almost like a never-ending.
[264:46.01]Especially after when it comes out and when it all launches.
[264:49.10]It will be a never-ending place to just kind of do this.
[264:52.86]Play and just experience a bunch of weird fucked up shit.
[264:57.24]Fun games, little short movies and... Just like LittleBigPlanet.
[265:04.95]Oh yeah, this is gonna be great.
[265:06.15]Alright, investigate upstairs.
[265:10.12]Non-finished games.
[265:11.14]Yeah, but it's only been on for like five or six days.
[265:15.37]You can't make an entire... This is remarkable for people that have... Let me just like eat all my sentences for a second.
[265:24.29]This is some pretty cool shit for only a week.
[265:30.72]So what is up here?
[265:37.18]The closet door is just closed.
[265:44.81]Should I open the closet?
[265:48.61]I'm gonna get jumpscared.
[266:02.18]Nothing in here.
[266:08.30]Bathroom mirror jumpscare in the mirror?
[266:19.49]What is that?
[266:27.90]Okay.
[266:40.82]Did we just load the monster into the game?
[266:46.54]Is there a monster?
[267:12.01]I'm going to make a horror game.
[267:13.33]I say that, but I want to make everything.
[267:17.24]Those hands?
[267:17.92]Alright, that scared the shit out of me, and I'll tell you one reason why it didn't come out of my headphones, it came out of the controller.
[267:31.45]I thought there was an insect on my hands, or something on my hands.
[267:38.93]Remember, press and hold options to recenter your imp.
[267:42.94]What?
[267:43.10]I don't have a flashlight.
[267:52.51]this is really what the hell is that there it is hiding down into the basement
[268:21.84]Is it supposed to be Cthulhu?
[268:30.30]I don't think a knife is gonna work here.
[268:37.32]I just threw the knife at him!
[268:40.42]Oh, fuck!
[268:53.94]Didn't even hit him with the sharp end.
[268:57.24]What was the point of the knife?
[268:58.32]A bad dream.
[269:09.74]How do I... oh, where's my thumbs up?
[269:10.98]I want to thumbs it up!
[269:13.25]No, I don't want to play it again.
[269:16.51]There.
[269:23.99]Which means I did thumb it up.
[269:25.21]That, right?
[269:30.42]Not suitable for children.
[269:33.88]Yeah, it's thumbed.
[269:41.36]Too scary.
[269:42.24]Alright, give me back.
[269:44.50]This one's called Radical.
[269:46.70]Bowling.
[269:48.80]The Bald Wizard.
[269:52.59]Let's travel the world in search for the Gem of Hair.
[269:59.15]Play Doom.
[270:01.23]Doom.
[270:01.77]Okay.
[270:02.11]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[270:03.49]Hold on.
[270:12.61]Doom.
[270:16.29]Of the Dreamerverse.
[270:17.41]Make sure we don't have to add that.
[270:20.03]Connie wakes in a strange and frightening place feeling not at all like herself.
[270:24.29]I've never seen such a strict, it actually is the Doom soundtrack.
[270:32.76]I am not feeling like myself today.
[270:34.64]Why am I a hot dog?
[270:52.15]I'm not going to comment on that.
[270:55.46]Leaps?
[270:59.66]I'm scared.
[271:06.63]I'm a tree and I'm scared.
[271:14.93]I'm scared.
[271:16.55]I'm a tree.
[271:20.64]I'm scared.
[271:34.39]Made it.
[271:37.88]What?
[271:38.14]Is this Anor Londo?
[271:39.44]What the fuck?
[272:22.76]Uh, I'm gonna dream.
[272:25.49]Beta mode active.
[272:28.03]So this is dream within a dream within the game of dreams, is what I'm gonna assume here.
[272:41.68]That's the button.
[272:56.37]We have been attacking you on the approach and being like... Approach what?
[273:05.76]The calculator?
[273:07.52]The giant calculator with the tape in it?
[273:12.85]Uh...
[273:25.74]Okay, this is just getting a little odd.
[273:36.77]Uh... Welcome to Media Molecule.
[273:41.63]This is the place where your home, the Dreamiverse, was first created.
[273:45.70]Why do the employees of Media Molecule walk around naked?
[273:48.12]This is not real.
[273:56.27]And where you were first spawned.
[273:58.73]We have noticed that new characters and worlds have begun to emerge.
[274:02.79]But there's no doom, Connie.
[274:04.07]Nothing to fear.
[274:06.37]Your world is simply expanding as we invite more Dreamers to create with us.
[274:12.19]Hope that makes you feel better.
[274:14.45]Now, what makes me feel better is reporting this whole office to HR.
[274:17.97]Because this is just not appropriate.
[274:20.95]Yes, it does.
[274:21.45]I can't wait to explore the Dreamiverse and meet new friends.
[274:26.11]Oh, I went home.
[274:52.85]Connie, wake up.
[274:55.29]Uh, winter surge, warmth on a desolate mountain slope, death's holiday, rat city.
[275:06.76]Bowling?
[275:07.26]Alright, fine.
[275:09.56]Bowling.
[275:15.98]Rear-frame camera, toggle neon mode.
[275:19.58]I don't want that on.
[275:21.76]There's the pin camera, cool.
[275:24.00]So I grab, um, something, I grab one out.
[275:27.68]And, uh... Strike, strike, get a strike!
[275:38.59]Come on!
[275:39.77]Come on!
[275:43.52]Neon mode?
[275:44.24]Fine.
[275:54.42]Shit.
[276:03.71]Uh, it's gonna be stuck there forever.
[276:06.69]It can't grab it.
[276:10.66]Wait, what's this?
[276:11.32]Rocket League?
[276:14.58]Not everything is Rocket League, guys.
[276:22.04]Strike.
[276:26.14]This is cool.
[276:26.76]This is cute.
[276:33.18]Come on.
[276:34.58]Spin, spin, spin!
[276:36.90]Aww.
[276:41.49]Shit.
[276:41.73]Give the ball some force?
[276:42.55]It's kind of hard to do.
[276:54.40]Because I have to do this with my gyro.
[277:02.70]That's brutal.
[277:08.42]It's pronounced gyro.
[277:09.80]No, my gyroscope.
[277:12.37]Get there.
[277:24.47]Get there!
[277:25.21]Come on!
[277:26.99]No!
[277:30.01]It's pronounced Gyrusscope.
[277:33.27]It is not pronounced Gyrusscope.
[277:34.83]You know how many times I've ordered a Gyrusscope before?
[277:52.92]Got one.
[277:55.34]Pink ball never misses, bro.
[277:56.84]Do it.
[278:02.33]Alright, here we go.
[278:08.31]Check that out.
[278:08.95]There's the force for you.
[278:09.89]You're not very good at bowling.
[278:14.46]Actually, I am not good at bowling at all.
[278:18.60]Bowling for me is mini golf.
[278:21.24]And I'll explain myself.
[278:22.70]They're the only two sports, the only two activities on Earth that enrage me.
[278:30.35]They enrage the fuck out of me.
[278:36.09]I don't know why.
[278:37.45]I'll go mini golfing and I start out fine and everything's just dandy and I'm having a good time and I will go over
[278:46.20]I will get like 12 strokes on one hole and want to leave.
[278:53.25]I will bowl and I will gutter ball twice or something or three times in a row and I'll just be like, I don't even fucking want to be here.
[278:58.26]I hate this.
[279:06.73]Something about it.
[279:07.31]I don't know what it is.
[279:07.99]Minigolf and bowling both really pissed me off.
[279:11.05]I think, you know, with bowling, I think it's like the real-time score that's up on the screen.
[279:15.87]So people know how bad you are.
[279:18.64]I used to like it back in the day.
[279:19.68]They had the thing on the table.
[279:22.12]It wasn't up on a big screen.
[279:24.38]People can walk by and look at your screen and see, oh, like the funny name you put up.
[279:28.96]Hot dog!
[279:30.08]Right?
[279:32.21]Has like 34 points.
[279:33.95]It's embarrassing.
[279:40.17]By the way, the only reason why I said the word hot dog is because we were just a hot dog on screen.
[279:43.95]What do you mean no one looks at that?
[279:49.20]I do.
[279:53.72]When I walk by, and I always hate when they put you next to the fucking good bowlers.
[279:58.86]I walk around and I request a lamb.
[280:03.72]I walk up and down, I look, okay, there's two here, there's one in between, two other parties bowling, and you look at the screen, they're at like 180, 200 average.
[280:11.95]I don't want to be next to that person.
[280:16.06]That would embarrass me.
[280:18.56]I will gutter ball three times in a row and watch them hit strikes.
[280:22.00]And it's just like, move me, I don't want to be there.
[280:33.69]200 isn't good?
[280:35.27]What?
[280:36.45]What planet are you talking about?
[280:38.29]200 is great!
[280:42.57]Imagine being insecure about bowling.
[280:46.86]No, it's just bowling and mini-golf, because mini-golf, the same thing happens.
[280:50.94]Two people will go in front of you, and they'll get a birdie.
[280:55.64]It's like, ah, birdie!
[280:56.68]Sick, man!
[280:57.30]Oh, nice, man!
[280:58.06]My turn!
[280:58.58]Oh, cool, my turn!
[280:59.32]Everyone watch me now!
[281:02.72]Ah, I thought I missed.
[281:04.94]It's okay, I can get it in.
[281:06.08]I can get it in now.
[281:07.93]Ah, I went over a lot.
[281:10.17]Way too much.
[281:10.83]Like, it was terrible.
[281:12.19]Hold on, no, I can still get par.
[281:13.63]It's okay.
[281:15.03]Everyone's sitting there with their arms crossed, waiting for you to finish.
[281:18.44]You knock it back, you miss again, and once you get to four or five strokes, you just have to do the thing where you drag the fucking ball around and just drag it into the hole, angry.
[281:27.60]Just because people want to play.
[281:35.21]Speaking of which, why am I still here?
[281:40.13]That was fun.
[281:40.53]If you don't like people seeing how bad you are, then why are you a streamer?
[281:52.97]What do you mean?
[281:53.81]I'm not bad.
[281:58.37]Did you beat Sekiro yet?
[282:00.23]I did that like two weeks ago.
[282:03.72]I beat the real, true final boss in Sekiro.
[282:07.50]How can I be bad at the game and still do that?
[282:09.46]That's impossible.
[282:10.08]Beat Sekiro on stream, Dark Souls 3 on stream, you know the fucking joke.
[282:12.92]I don't even need to say it.
[282:15.37]Chef vs. Chocolate from Space.
[282:16.93]I kinda need to play this one.
[282:21.71]You always get high scores at all the wrong things.
[282:25.71]What does that mean?
[282:32.32]Look at how cute this is.
[282:37.12]What do I have to do?
[282:47.43]But Sekiro's not even that hard.
[282:50.19]I mean, look, you can say that if you want, but Sekiro started like a massive debate about how hard video games are.
[283:10.88]Somebody tune the piano.
[283:16.82]For the love of God, somebody tune the piano.
[283:19.08]That's the funniest comment all night.
[283:28.53]How do you tune a piano?
[283:30.61]Can you even tune a piano?
[283:31.91]Okay, is it weird?
[283:35.07]Let me tell you guys something.
[283:36.01]This is the fucking weird thing about me.
[283:38.69]I'm scared of instruments.
[283:43.80]Add that to the wiki.
[283:47.72]And I'll tell you, listen, I'm going to hear me out on this.
[283:50.98]I am terrified of an acoustic guitar.
[283:56.71]Do you know why?
[283:57.29]I don't know what, it's something weird about it.
[284:01.15]Those strings are so tight.
[284:04.98]Every time I had roommates in college that would play the guitar, I've had friends that had guitars, and you would... They'd pick it up and they'd tune it, and it would be like... Like, it's getting so taut, it's gonna snap and it's gonna hurt them.
[284:18.34]I had to get up and leave.
[284:27.74]Speaking of leaving...
[284:33.13]I would see them just sitting on the couch and it'd be like... And that's when I get up.
[284:43.48]I'm like, I think it's gonna break.
[284:44.66]It's gonna hurt them.
[284:47.32]Same thing with the piano.
[284:48.00]It's just really tight strings.
[284:50.10]Tight.
[284:54.00]Wait, didn't we already do this one?
[285:01.49]You are not supposed to be here.
[285:05.80]Bald wizard?
[285:06.44]Okay, fine.
[285:06.96]That sounds like a good one.
[285:14.66]Also, you guys know about the balloon thing.
[285:16.88]I'm scared of balloons.
[285:19.72]Look, I will be the first person in line at the haunted house.
[285:24.74]I will do all kinds of scary, dangerous shit.
[285:28.62]But if you blow up a balloon in the room that I'm in, I'm going to leave the room.
[285:39.51]You could fill a room with cockroaches, and I would roll around on the ground and be like, this is fun, this is nothing, there's nothing, not even a problem here.
[285:50.43]You could bury me in sand up to my mouth.
[285:56.15]And like, have to tie, like, I would be fine.
[285:58.41]I'd be like, ah, this is kind of weird, but this is like, you'll dig me out eventually, right?
[286:08.48]I would go skydiving.
[286:12.62]No.
[286:13.56]You blow a balloon up in the room.
[286:14.62]I'm sorry.
[286:14.94]I have to leave.
[286:20.58]It's that the balloon's blowing.
[286:22.42]This is the story of a wizard.
[286:26.92]A bald wizard whose only goal in life is to grow some hair.
[286:33.51]He has tried everything he can, done vast amounts of research, read many books.
[286:41.44]But he could not find a way to get his hair to grow.
[286:46.24]That is until he found out about the gem of hair.
[286:51.71]A magical stone said to grow hair anywhere one desires.
[286:57.44]The only problem is the bald wizard has no idea where it is located.
[287:05.05]He makes his way to a village he's never been to before.
[287:10.55]He decides the best place to find answers would be in a tavern.
[287:16.06]So he makes his way towards the tavern.
[287:19.38]As he gets ready to begin his journey in search of the magical stone that will help him achieve the one goal he has in life.
[287:31.30]To grow some hair.
[287:33.98]This is the beginning of a long journey.
[287:41.40]Okay, we're in the bald wizard.
[287:51.85]No, things don't scare me.
[287:52.97]Like haunted houses, scary things don't scare me.
[287:58.21]A clown could be in a dark room.
[288:02.65]My lights in my bedroom could be off and there could be a clown in there.
[288:06.56]With a huge long face.
[288:08.54]Blood coming out of his eyes and two knives in his hands.
[288:10.82]And he walks up and goes right in my face while I'm dead asleep and goes like... And I would go, whoa, hey, what the fuck, man?
[288:23.65]Well, get out of here dude, fuck.
[288:25.67]It wouldn't scare me that much.
[288:26.55]I'd just be like, get out of here.
[288:41.72]I'd be like, get the fuck away from me, idiot.
[288:43.78]I'd like push you and be like, fuck out of here.
[288:45.50]Why am I saying you?
[288:46.46]I guess if this is one of you guys.
[288:51.97]Oh god.
[288:53.76]Why is it you?
[289:00.16]That's fucking terrifying.
[289:02.52]Anyways.
[289:11.44]But if that clown was just no makeup on.
[289:13.80]Take the makeup off the clown.
[289:15.54]He doesn't even have to have it on.
[289:16.52]I feel like this mechanic doesn't work.
[289:22.23]Okay, get the clown in the room with the bloody eyes, the two knives, and the scary laugh.
[289:27.10]Take the makeup off.
[289:30.14]Take the knives away.
[289:35.55]Make his voice normal, don't laugh.
[289:38.67]Hand him a guitar.
[289:39.79]And have him tune the guitar while I'm asleep.
[289:44.60]Same scenario.
[289:45.54]I'm asleep.
[289:52.34]I will wake up screaming.
[290:02.45]What the fuck?
[290:05.03]Clowns make balloon animals.
[290:06.15]No, that's fine too.
[290:07.21]Actually, no, it's not fine.
[290:08.71]They put that shit in their mouth?
[290:10.41]Nope.
[290:12.47]I saw a guy make a balloon animal one time.
[290:15.39]And he was like... And putting his mouth and tying it with his teeth and like...
[290:23.19]I hate that sound, I don't like it.
[290:24.23]And it always tur- It's right before it's about to explode.
[290:33.94]And it has nothing to do with the damage inflicted.
[290:38.77]Now, what am I supposed to do about this?
[290:52.16]Because if a balloon pops in your face, it's just going to be weird.
[290:55.72]Oh, I have to bring that over here.
[291:02.71]It's not going to really hurt you.
[291:03.87]I don't know why I have this weird image of a balloon popping near somebody's face.
[291:10.97]And like Daffy Duck cartoon fucking exploding cigars in their face.
[291:14.97]I don't know why I think of that.
[291:16.07]I just do.
[291:18.81]Can I make this jump?
[291:19.97]I don't think I can.
[291:22.47]Do I have to drag that all the way across?
[291:30.09]Why is this not moving?
[291:37.63]Can't bring it over here.
[291:40.71]Because I definitely don't think I can make this.
[291:45.78]No.
[291:52.01]Well, there you go.
[292:00.88]I'm like a snake.
[292:02.44]If I was an animal, I would be a snake.
[292:04.84]I would.
[292:05.95]Well, well, I thought you were gonna be a rat!
[292:07.29]No, I'd be a snake.
[292:07.95]Because snakes aren't afraid of anything.
[292:11.31]Except if you make a loud noise really quickly.
[292:15.05]Or if you tune a guitar in front of a snake.
[292:20.22]X and R2.
[292:26.24]These flames launch you in a specific direction, do they?
[292:31.11]Okay, well, you lose momentum there.
[292:36.69]Snakes don't know what sound is.
[292:37.99]What do you mean they don't know what sound is?
[292:49.44]Uh, then what?
[292:52.60]Did I get... I think I won.
[292:53.87]I think that's the bald coin.
[293:01.10]No, snakes, yeah, snakes has no sudden movement, so, right.
[293:07.10]Not sudden noises.
[293:08.04]What's the animal that doesn't like sudden noises?
[293:17.98]An elephant.
[293:20.45]A horse, okay, yes, yeah, okay.
[293:22.37]I'm thinking of a horse.
[293:26.19]I'm more like a horse.
[293:34.33]Alright, this one was fun.
[293:43.41]Frogs?
[293:43.83]Frogs aren't scared of that.
[293:45.39]Death's Holiday.
[293:46.15]Alright, keep going.
[293:49.19]Torch Top.
[293:51.07]The Hollow.
[293:52.97]Kingdom Come.
[293:54.59]Open world strategy game where you run and build a fully functioning kingdom.
[293:59.97]Build empires and fight other nations.
[294:04.18]What?
[294:04.66]How does this work?
[294:09.38]Search for Jerma, can I?
[294:12.97]Is this actually possible?
[294:17.73]Uh, this is gonna be... This is really awesome.
[294:24.09]This is really, really awesome.
[294:26.75]It is, but I don't have time for this.
[294:29.19]I do, but this looks great.
[294:31.59]I don't have time for this.
[294:33.99]Okay.
[294:44.22]No.
[294:45.36]There ain't nothing there.
[294:51.56]Let's auto-surf.
[294:56.48]Embarrassing.
[294:57.34]Why would it be embarrassing?
[295:01.46]Press triangle to drink absinthe.
[295:25.52]Um, I don't think I can play this it looks beautiful, but the shaky screen no good That's really great That was really cool
[295:56.40]That was just a moving art piece.
[295:57.78]That was great.
[296:02.42]No.
[296:03.10]There's more.
[296:05.48]Is there more?
[296:05.92]I don't think there's more.
[296:10.94]I think that's it.
[296:13.16]That looks so... Ugh, that's so cool.
[296:22.92]Battletops title screen.
[296:24.44]Well...
[296:26.32]We're not gonna see that yet.
[296:27.16]A haunted entrance!
[296:29.55]Nice.
[296:31.97]This is by the ever-talented Mr. Sandwiches.
[296:35.15]The hell?
[296:48.68]Oh.
[296:52.78]I can run.
[296:54.26]X is run.
[297:02.43]Oh shit, we're on, uh... Ferrovium.
[297:11.34]It's gonna be a top-down.
[297:12.40]It's one of these.
[297:14.94]Wow.
[297:16.40]This is cool.
[297:23.23]It's cool.
[297:27.03]Wow.
[297:35.28]I exploded!
[297:47.69]Are they bad?
[297:49.55]What is up there?
[297:50.69]Okay, this is bizarre.
[297:54.38]Can I talk to people?
[297:55.22]Is this completely gonna hurt me?
[298:01.14]Floating candles, bells...
[298:07.55]Let's go up here.
[298:10.05]See the giant monster or whatever this is.
[298:11.72]Is this a skull?
[298:12.54]What is that?
[298:39.83]Scary eyes.
[298:46.99]Oh my god.
[298:47.85]Does he have a saw blade in his chest?
[298:56.28]What did he say?
[298:57.38]Apple by AWMall2019 Apple by
[299:10.16]This guy painted all these apples.
[299:11.92]Press square.
[299:15.18]Dogs run.
[299:17.25]Aw.
[299:21.71]I always saw this before.
[299:31.75]We're open!
[299:33.53]Looks like Susie's home.
[299:34.55]Bark!
[299:40.28]Didn't you play this on the PlayStation 2?
[299:41.66]A version of it, yeah.
[299:44.71]Good to see you again.
[299:45.49]I prepared some snazzy upgrades for you.
[299:49.15]I think you'll like them.
[299:50.73]Dashing double dash.
[299:52.36]Magomatic.
[299:55.16]That's 100 coins.
[299:55.66]I don't have enough.
[300:15.12]Don't be detected.
[300:18.00]This is the Metal Gear Solid VR missions.
[300:22.56]Press X to switch between prone and standing.
[300:34.17]Wait, what?
[300:41.81]Didn't even see it.
[300:52.05]It actually is the noise, too.
[301:00.72]That's pretty cool.
[301:10.66]He's not gonna see me here, right?
[301:13.99]Oh shit.
[301:23.37]It's not the exact noise?
[301:24.51]It's pretty close.
[301:26.05]Um, how far does that go?
[301:31.62]There's no... where does the camera go?
[301:33.22]It just aims that way on the wall?
[301:37.06]Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[301:39.30]Is that the camera doing that?
[301:42.74]These cameras aren't even set up correctly.
[301:59.71]Ow!
[301:59.95]If I didn't get stuck, I would have gone right through it.
[302:10.30]UCQC?
[302:11.22]If I had it, I would use it.
[302:14.12]He's trying so hard.
[302:15.94]I know.
[302:17.48]You don't think I know that?
[302:23.28]Ha, I thought I was trying to jump.
[302:37.51]Oh!
[302:41.39]Get in there.
[302:45.37]Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[302:46.43]I couldn't even see.
[302:49.18]Couldn't even see it!
[302:49.84]How am I supposed to be able to do that?
[302:55.28]I can't see through here.
[303:12.01]Poltergeist?
[303:15.79]I just got knocked out of the room.
[303:18.43]This looks beautiful.
[303:19.27]Find your bo- This is the dog one.
[303:20.65]This one's unbelievably good.
[303:23.19]Find your bone.
[303:30.86]I love the bark.
[303:37.69]I wish I could pick the dog, though.
[303:38.69]It'd be so much better.
[303:39.67]I could pick the breed.
[303:44.36]This is the kind of shit that I'm gonna try to make.
[303:45.62]I'm gonna put a bunch of time into a bunch of skill.
[303:49.90]A bunch of technical prowess.
[303:53.57]I'm gonna hire like 15 people.
[303:54.39]I'm gonna spend like $20,000 or $30,000 on tomorrow's stream.
[303:58.09]You're gonna still fail.
[304:14.38]Thanks for the confidence, man.
[304:28.07]And still fail.
[304:29.37]Fine.
[304:31.59]I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is tomorrow.
[304:36.17]This is really well made.
[304:50.06]Alright, ready for the prediction?
[304:52.22]I'm gonna spend so much time, I'm gonna fucking learn everything, I'm gonna have like a bunch of stuff to show.
[304:57.34]I'm not gonna do anything tonight, I'm gonna sleep in tomorrow and be late to the stream and not have anything done.
[305:03.50]Let's put that as an expectation so I can at least meet or be better than that.
[305:16.34]Dog has a flashlight on its collar, okay.
[305:24.95]This is great.
[305:27.93]Did an employee make this or is this not an employee?
[305:30.13]Let's see.
[305:31.87]No, this is not an employee.
[305:33.99]This is just somebody that has the game.
[305:35.47]Anybody there?
[306:05.44]Ooh, there's a bone!
[306:06.40]You found the bone!
[306:07.22]I did it in three minutes.
[306:12.60]That's my total playtime, three hours.
[306:14.67]Secret waterfall?
[306:16.15]I think so, yeah.
[306:17.63]Two bones?
[306:18.91]No.
[306:40.88]Nice.
[306:42.44]This one's called Car Drift.
[306:43.70]Accelerate brake, shift up and down, hand brake, boost camera view.
[306:50.31]Lights.
[306:54.16]Shift up.
[307:08.53]I drove into the garage.
[307:11.95]Alright, I gotta shift down.
[307:29.74]I think I broke the car.
[307:30.53]I'm trying to shift and...
[307:43.30]It was interesting.
[307:45.14]Anyway, back in the Haunted Mansion.
[307:55.15]I think I'm gonna pleasantly surprise a lot of you tomorrow.
[308:02.39]Porto!
[308:13.72]Show controls.
[308:14.40]We got jump, pick up object, throw object, stand in place.
[308:21.47]It's gonna be one of these little puzzle games.
[308:33.40]He's not doing a Chad block.
[308:45.42]Yeah, this is nice too.
[308:47.91]I wonder if there is... Here's the interesting thing, right?
[308:53.65]Some of these look like they have a different... almost like a different engine or something.
[309:00.05]This looks different.
[309:04.27]Well, I have to get up here first.
[309:07.77]This doesn't look like the other games.
[309:14.69]It almost looks like the frame rate is different, or the... how it's processed looks different.
[309:23.87]Maybe the lighting?
[309:24.53]Yeah.
[309:24.85]What does this do?
[309:40.00]Uh... okay.
[309:41.70]Well... Oops.
[309:52.16]Cool.
[309:53.14]Grab another one.
[309:56.41]Oh, I can only have one.
[310:05.93]Now we go this way.
[310:13.64]Hmm.
[310:14.82]Oops.
[310:20.66]The perspective's a little odd.
[310:23.83]First book.
[310:25.01]Alright.
[310:26.15]It's kind of odd.
[310:33.50]I collected them.
[310:34.12]I don't care.
[310:36.42]Why is this pre-recorded?
[310:37.62]What the hell are you talking about?
[310:51.83]Really?
[310:52.15]That just bounced back and beat in the face.
[310:53.41]Okay.
[310:56.64]Good throw.
[310:57.04]It was an okay throw.
[311:23.45]Now... This... Go... Wait, what's over here?
[311:30.92]I like this one.
[311:31.46]This one's really good.
[311:33.24]There's another one there.
[311:39.76]Okay, I have to blow the... The wind machine.
[311:47.45]There's proof that this is a pre-recorded stream.
[311:50.13]I would love to hear your proof.
[311:53.74]I'd love to hear it.
[311:59.06]What proof do you have?
[312:08.79]There it is.
[312:17.22]High-speed hovercraft demo.
[312:18.74]Work in progress.
[312:19.56]This looks cool.
[312:28.77]You can go really fast.
[312:30.15]Oh my god.
[312:37.65]It still works!
[312:39.39]Am I upside down?
[312:40.09]Headlights.
[312:43.60]Look back.
[312:44.20]Handbrake.
[312:44.96]Drift.
[312:52.56]Headlights.
[312:54.38]Turn music on and off.
[313:02.84]Well, it's pretty good, actually.
[313:04.01]Okay.
[313:09.93]Brake.
[313:10.35]Drift.
[313:14.04]Handbrake.
[313:18.12]Drive over this jump.
[313:19.90]Got it.
[313:28.86]Now we're in the catacombs from... we're still in this haunted house.
[313:33.28]I think this is Satan.
[313:40.90]Devil or something?
[313:44.59]Can I talk to the devil?
[313:50.07]Uh, I don't think so.
[313:51.53]Hold square to open, but wait.
[313:54.90]Alright, that's a tail, thank god.
[314:04.52]I don't think I can die.
[314:07.26]What the hell?
[314:18.83]Make it multiplayer, bring it to PC.
[314:24.78]Yeah, I think this is a Sony exclusive.
[314:29.18]I don't think you'll ever see this on PC.
[314:30.48]I'm going to make something like this.
[314:35.62]You guys are going to get fucking terrified.
[314:38.45]I'm going to make the scariest shit imaginable.
[314:42.53]You guys are going to get jump scared.
[314:43.87]It's going to be unreal.
[314:51.85]Is that it?
[314:52.21]What's going on?
[314:58.31]Is this just the end?
[314:59.37]Oh, pool, okay.
[315:17.06]We still have the music from the last one playing.
[315:23.76]So then how do I... is it just X?
[315:32.34]Show controls?
[315:33.00]Okay.
[315:34.03]Slow aim.
[315:34.95]Shoot!
[315:35.47]Aim guide.
[315:36.01]Okay.
[315:37.19]No, I'm not going to turn that on.
[315:38.09]People will make fun of me.
[315:40.49]So, shoot is R2.
[315:47.35]Demonic billiards.
[315:48.53]Alright, we're going to go with a green ball.
[315:58.85]In the right corner pocket there.
[316:09.28]I thought I was gonna scratch.
[316:10.55]I was about to instantly exit the game.
[316:12.65]I'm just gonna do the thing I do when I play pool with anybody.
[316:24.57]Just hit it into huge chunks.
[316:26.37]And then whatever you get in, act like you tried to do that in the first place.
[316:37.90]Got it.
[316:38.16]Alright, I'm stripes.
[316:40.54]Not like it matters.
[316:43.33]Oh, you're one of those guys, huh?
[316:44.83]Yeah, for instance, see this over here?
[316:45.95]I mean, I could try to get that, but why wouldn't I just go like this?
[316:58.98]Crawling across the table.
[317:09.12]I'm on the table.
[317:10.76]I didn't realize that.
[317:11.46]I'm standing on the table.
[317:15.28]Get them both.
[317:20.74]It's that easy.
[317:34.59]Ah!
[317:40.50]What do you mean foul?
[317:42.12]This ain't basketball.
[317:45.53]Fuck you.
[317:45.95]Get in there.
[317:58.41]Trying to get that red ball out of there.
[318:01.93]Pretty good, I think, if you ask me.
[318:08.08]Alright, see that ball all the way down there?
[318:09.80]We're gonna get a good spot.
[318:12.30]Check that.
[318:15.02]Oh, fucking come on!
[318:20.85]What the hell?
[318:36.59]View from Westminster Christmas 1893.
[318:39.83]Merry Christmas.
[318:48.48]It's too good to scratch.
[319:05.57]Nice.
[319:11.88]Why is it getting scary?
[319:33.09]Free roam.
[319:34.15]Health bars, yeah sure.
[319:35.37]Tactics, shooter, TPS.
[319:41.35]How do I use?
[319:44.98]Equip pistol, rifle, aim, shoot.
[319:50.38]Damn, this is actually pretty nice.
[320:08.12]What about pistol?
[320:15.32]This is nice too.
[320:27.03]That was cool.
[320:30.09]Neon, part one.
[320:44.57]This is cool.
[320:45.23]Puts you out here.
[320:46.91]The camera's in the same spot.
[320:57.53]Something's following me.
[320:58.35]That's the something is waiting and looking and trying to find out.
[321:01.72]Whoa.
[321:03.92]No, never mind.
[321:05.64]This is called Chinese New Year.
[321:06.98]At the temple.
[321:09.98]Just fucking dropped.
[321:13.35]What the hell did I just draw?
[321:14.97]A mouse.
[321:20.35]Alright, here we go.
[321:24.67]It's a wallpaper.
[321:25.49]That's nice.
[321:29.24]All this is crafted.
[321:30.28]This is beautiful.
[321:34.08]Fireworks go off.
[321:34.86]That's cool.
[321:43.46]Treasure hunt.
[321:48.35]Collect all.
[321:57.99]This is probably... a pretty... Oh, I thought that was ice.
[322:02.90]What I was going to say is this is probably a template.
[322:10.00]that a lot of people do for their first... game, maybe?
[322:13.40]It's just easy to... do the runaround and collect stuff.
[322:19.32]Alright, how do I get... unlock more coins?
[322:24.15]Yeah, I'm gonna put time into this!
[322:30.95]I'm gonna give it at least one real shot.
[322:36.29]We're gonna have a giant viewing experience.
[322:41.63]Those of you that also have dreams, and you want to make something, and maybe we'll play it tomorrow, because tomorrow is the creation day.
[322:50.02]This was just, dick around and see what people have made.
[322:53.06]Maybe we'll make a certain tag that you can put on the, your creation, right?
[322:58.43]Like, just like, Jerma dash something, or whatever it is.
[323:04.39]It'd probably be easier to do it that way, so I can just search for Jerma, right?
[323:17.36]This is Neon Part 2.
[323:21.71]Is it gonna have VR support?
[323:24.07]Wow.
[323:26.63]It's only 2.4 gigs.
[323:31.01]Yeah, they really condensed it down.
[323:36.02]What?
[323:40.48]Give people time to build stuff?
[323:42.56]Well, look, uh, okay, let me be completely honest and not joke around here.
[323:47.18]Uh... I'm gonna do a bunch of shit tonight.
[323:52.90]And I'm gonna try to show something tomorrow.
[323:56.04]But if it's very clear that it takes a very long time to do anything, then maybe I will just say, hey, in like a week we're gonna do a green screen part two!
[324:05.37]Green screen movie night part two!
[324:09.84]But it's dreams!
[324:17.49]And give a tag.
[324:18.17]Yeah, I would just do it.
[324:19.37]Just hashtag Jerma.
[324:21.63]Or have Jerma be in your title as well.
[324:24.39]What the hell?
[324:24.99]This is a roller coaster?
[324:26.25]That's cool.
[324:48.73]There's no more track.
[324:51.13]Is this the end?
[324:51.65]Did we just fall off?
[324:53.37]Alright.
[324:54.65]Neon Part 3.
[325:05.02]Whoa.
[325:06.86]What the hell?
[325:09.64]Oh.
[325:12.31]I revealed the cool game mechanic before I was supposed to.
[325:21.60]Let's head down here.
[325:29.44]What is this?
[325:29.84]Can I pick this up?
[325:30.54]I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking for here, but... Maybe I'll find it.
[325:49.40]I guess not.
[325:50.74]Portrait!
[325:52.70]I'm gonna draw a bunch of shit too.
[325:54.00]I think we already saw this one, yeah?
[326:06.17]Wait, we already did this!
[326:07.63]Another roller coaster?
[326:08.87]This has to be by the same person, right?
[326:29.46]Okay.
[326:32.98]That was pretty cool.
[326:38.35]Wow.
[326:43.11]Neon.
[326:43.73]Part 4.
[326:49.88]Is that me?
[326:52.76]That's me doing what I did earlier.
[327:08.60]Anything else I can do?
[327:09.87]Can I go through the window?
[327:16.69]We could have watched all the tutorials by now?
[327:19.27]No way.
[327:21.27]And plus, here's the thing.
[327:22.59]There's a diff- oh, this is... There's a difference between watching tutorials for three hours and enjoying content that people have made.
[327:31.01]Also, these tutorials are pretty in-depth.
[327:34.78]And I'm going to assume it's probably going to take about three hours to do most of them.
[327:39.26]I also want to understand them too.
[327:42.08]Somebody made a good point where... This is really cool.
[327:45.97]Somebody made a really good point that if I do tutorials on stream, it's kind of just I sit there quiet while I focus on how to play the game for three or four hours.
[327:55.87]So I'm just going to do it off stream.
[328:01.75]Purple pants beta celebration dance.
[328:42.46]I would call this unsettling.
[328:48.04]That was it.
[328:48.60]That was the whole thing.
[328:49.88]Time corruption.
[328:52.33]Time has been stopped to prevent further damage.
[328:54.73]Agent intervention required.
[328:56.61]One, find the time control bracelet.
[328:58.73]Activate the power nodes.
[329:00.91]Enter into the powered singularity to restart the time.
[329:04.69]Take control of the agent.
[329:17.40]Why would there be checkpoints right next to me?
[329:19.02]What are these checkpoints for?
[329:25.23]Not Tron.
[329:38.10]I like the design of the floors.
[329:39.10]It's almost like they made it out of chalk.
[329:46.62]Found the time bracelet.
[329:58.04]Forward and time... Oh, okay.
[329:59.82]Let's see what it's doing.
[330:02.34]Very cool.
[330:03.36]Oh.
[330:04.32]Never mind.
[330:05.42]Wait.
[330:09.58]What's this?
[330:17.88]They'll close them up like I do back here.
[330:23.85]Flip them.
[330:25.25]Hey, look at that.
[330:27.17]And then this one.
[330:40.79]I wonder when you actually know how to do everything and use the tools correctly.
[330:43.87]I wonder how long it takes to make something.
[330:49.12]I guess it really depends on what you want to do.
[330:50.48]You could probably do dancing disco diaper guy.
[330:55.42]Oh, god damn it.
[330:56.36]You could probably do that in like 30 or 40 minutes.
[331:00.82]Would it be a day of work?
[331:13.35]Yeah.
[331:14.35]We'll see what I can do.
[331:16.69]Oh, god.
[331:22.26]How many more of these are there?
[331:37.45]I'm not controlling this.
[331:49.98]Lovecraftian Horror Intro.
[331:52.61]The most merciful thing in the world is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.
[331:59.90]That was by H.P.
[332:00.74]Lovecraft.
[332:10.24]That's it.
[332:10.54]That was the intro.
[332:15.12]For my snow scene.
[332:16.36]I'm gonna get addicted to this game.
[332:18.56]And wanna make all kinds of crazy shit.
[332:20.30]I know I will.
[332:20.84]I can already tell.
[332:21.54]It's something that I'm gonna wanna do.
[332:23.90]Just sit on the couch and make shit for like five straight hours.
[332:29.05]Paris Purple Rain.
[332:30.97]He's back again.
[332:41.18]Please don't just play LittleBigPlanet.
[332:43.02]Why would I do that when this is their new game?
[332:47.88]This is LittleBigPlanet with like 10,000 times more content.
[332:54.32]You can make everything you can make in LittleBigPlanet.
[332:57.02]What the fuck?
[332:58.30]Anybody know what he said?
[333:25.13]I'm not sure I can go anywhere.
[333:26.17]I believe this is a tech demo.
[333:33.86]In the building?
[333:37.40]I guess so.
[333:39.92]Well, maybe we'll see what it is.
[333:41.48]Look at how cool that looks.
[333:56.34]It's like clay, but not clay.
[333:57.88]It's like clay and wood together.
[333:59.32]Whoa.
[333:59.66]Here's the outro.
[334:25.01]Small glimpse of what's to come.
[334:26.29]Follow if you wish to discover what lurks beyond.
[334:31.59]Okay.
[334:33.31]This is another one from Media Molecule.
[334:45.36]Wow.
[334:47.58]People are gonna be making these living comic books and shit.
[335:01.80]I don't even want to see that one.
[335:03.44]Mini golf, I'm ready!
[335:08.00]Oh, you're hitting the little guy, okay.
[335:16.25]Alright, where's the flag?
[335:33.04]Water.
[335:33.58]Bad.
[335:34.08]Alright, I'm gonna hit it up with the trees.
[335:38.38]Shortcut.
[335:38.74]Head is right here.
[335:41.16]That'll be good.
[335:44.21]Okay.
[335:47.23]Just gotta go right here.
[336:08.58]Alright, let's get a good putt.
[336:15.86]Alright, come on.
[336:16.66]Don't be angry.
[336:17.50]Where's my putter?
[336:23.83]No, I need to chip it over here.
[336:25.87]Just give me a wedge.
[336:29.97]God damn it.
[336:30.55]I didn't mean to do that.
[336:32.32]I'm about to be over par here.
[336:35.73]50 meter putt.
[336:36.95]I'm gonna get angry here.
[336:37.75]I'm gonna be over par.
[336:38.57]I only got one more chance before I break the fucking thing in half.
[336:57.05]God damn it.
[337:17.56]Fucking golf is a dumb game.
[337:22.84]Wow.
[337:27.97]Bear study.
[337:34.09]Praying Mantis Showcase.
[337:40.46]Imagine somebody in the PGA Tour did that.
[337:42.48]That looks great.
[337:50.90]Wow.
[337:56.00]That's fantastic.
[338:02.45]I'm gonna try to recreate some of this shit, and it's gonna look so bad.
[338:05.57]I'm gonna try, though.
[338:06.33]I'm really gonna try.
[338:09.85]I promise.
[338:10.35]Alright, definitely give this one a thumbs up.
[338:18.58]That's really great work.
[338:23.21]Shifting islands?
[338:24.69]Oh wait, it's me.
[338:26.79]I'm Kirby.
[338:28.07]Those are Kirby's eyes.
[338:31.23]I know Kirby's eyes when I've seen him.
[338:38.03]Double jump.
[338:44.35]It's Rayman Kirby!
[338:45.65]It kind of is, yeah.
[338:52.10]Different hats?
[338:54.14]Twelve?
[338:55.14]Seven?
[338:56.20]What does this... what does it do?
[338:58.92]Powers?
[339:01.06]No, just cosmetics.
[339:05.53]Uh, what do you want me to do?
[339:09.43]Oh, and when you jump, they disappear.
[339:10.97]It's not gonna work, it needs to be like this.
[339:28.01]That's pretty cool.
[339:29.93]It's not a bad mechanic, it's fun.
[339:41.00]Is that from 3D World?
[339:45.37]Can I get on top?
[339:48.17]No, I don't think I need to.
[339:51.01]Whoa, shit!
[339:51.71]Right, I was blocking that.
[339:52.82]Okay.
[339:59.59]Gotta reset it.
[340:00.43]Alright.
[340:09.06]Now, go like that.
[340:16.39]Anyone money for hats?
[340:19.57]Uh, which one?
[340:20.81]This party hat right here?
[340:21.97]Yeah.
[340:23.51]Oh, now that's a color.
[340:24.29]That's me.
[340:27.29]Oh, shit.
[340:28.19]They brought more into play here.
[340:45.54]Alright, be careful.
[340:46.24]Alright.
[340:58.06]Didn't get a diamond?
[340:58.80]It's okay.
[341:09.62]This is fun.
[341:10.80]This is fun just playing other people's shit.
[341:17.05]I could just sit here and do this.
[341:19.43]But I wanna learn.
[341:20.29]I wanna learn!
[341:24.15]How to do everything.
[341:26.17]What's the goal?
[341:26.73]The blue?
[341:30.39]Okay, so you double jump with that.
[341:32.55]Double jump again.
[341:34.50]Go up!
[341:35.42]Come on!
[341:35.82]Go up!
[341:39.88]Now what?
[341:40.36]Oh, fuck.
[341:43.04]Okay.
[341:45.42]This is well made.
[341:48.91]Now I have to jump over here when we get to there.
[341:59.50]Oh, shit.
[342:00.00]Okay.
[342:01.48]And then... Uh-oh.
[342:08.19]Hey, that's it!
[342:10.51]I did it!
[342:13.91]Oh!
[342:16.79]I felt like that was gonna happen.
[342:17.91]I knew that was gonna happen.
[342:19.05]I don't know why I knew that was gonna happen.
[342:22.12]I knew it.
[342:23.24]I could just feel it for some reason.
[342:25.88]Whatever.
[342:26.20]It's fine.
[342:35.13]Not gonna happen again.
[342:44.11]Almost happened again.
[342:44.75]Is this a camera?
[342:47.30]Was it all just to take a picture of myself?
[342:52.11]It was.
[342:57.33]That's cool.
[343:01.03]Wait, I gotta give a thumbs up.
[343:02.19]No, I gotta give a... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[343:03.81]I want a thumbs up!
[343:04.51]Aww, that's too bad.
[343:19.81]How much does this cost?
[343:21.17]It's $30.
[343:25.65]$29.99.
[343:26.69]For what is potential to come, that's a steal.
[343:29.14]Okay, this is the grape.
[343:32.48]Escape level 1.
[343:37.26]Jump and double jump.
[343:38.40]Press and hold R1 for guided line.
[343:40.38]Oh, it just... Really?
[343:41.89]I just cheated.
[343:54.45]There's only one way to go.
[343:56.33]And I pressed it.
[344:05.38]Wait, what happened to the Link costume?
[344:09.36]Is this a different Kokiri Forest?
[344:18.61]There's two of them.
[344:19.27]There's more than one.
[344:28.50]Wow.
[344:30.70]No Link model in this one, though.
[344:39.02]Shops and stuff.
[344:42.90]What about here?
[344:43.44]Is this work?
[344:44.68]No, I don't think I need work.
[344:48.13]This is so cool.
[344:58.39]This is really well made.
[345:07.60]Can I go down here?
[345:11.36]Nope.
[345:13.52]The Deku Tree?
[345:17.05]It's been a long time since I've played Zelda.
[345:19.21]I don't really... I don't know where that is.
[345:20.89]Is it up there?
[345:30.35]It's the other side.
[345:37.10]It's down here, right?
[345:37.78]You go through the little forest hallway.
[345:42.56]You're supposed to instantly know that.
[345:46.48]Wow.
[345:52.37]How do you even make this?
[346:07.22]Let me in.
[346:07.72]Yeah, let me in.
[346:08.36]I'm not sure I can get in.
[346:11.60]Oh, this is beautiful.
[346:17.20]Job well done.
[346:18.12]Thumbs that one up.
[346:22.27]Is it still live?
[346:34.97]Paint tools, I have to assume that you can probably use the move controllers, right?
[346:42.71]It's probably easier to use the move controllers with a lot of this stuff.
[346:45.93]Maybe I'll charge them up and get them plugged in.
[346:49.82]Can't undo anything though.
[347:02.97]Yes, I'm using the guide, but I just wanted to see the game.
[347:13.04]Stop cheating.
[347:14.12]It's not cheating if it's a developer-implemented device to help the player get to the end.
[347:20.83]I didn't have to hack this.
[347:21.57]I didn't put in Game Genie.
[347:22.39]I didn't put a cheat code in.
[347:31.03]It's an easy mode, but it's not cheating Come on
[347:57.11]Is the model of the grapes in the game?
[347:59.45]Or do you have to actually... Do you have to make it?
[348:02.25]Did you make this?
[348:04.15]It's probably already made.
[348:12.68]Maybe.
[348:18.16]Tough job.
[348:25.09]Most of the models have been made by the users.
[348:27.07]That's really awesome.
[348:30.54]A lot of platforming in this one.
[348:33.88]The first one was just getting out of the house.
[348:35.94]Oh, now we're... Oh, thank god for that goddamn mode.
[348:40.61]This helped me so much, I would've just been stuck.
[349:02.22]That was weird.
[349:03.19]Warning!
[349:03.99]As this was made in the beta, there will be bugs and glitches.
[349:06.33]Please enjoy the ride.
[349:12.43]Coming out of the controller.
[349:16.05]The horror transforms.
[349:23.48]Stand up.
[349:33.99]Hmm.
[349:36.04]L1 is zoom.
[349:37.06]View objectives.
[349:38.90]Icons.
[349:41.20]Mark with a white icon to be interactable.
[349:43.05]Alright.
[349:46.03]Song of Betrayal will set you free.
[349:52.05]Follow the recording, follow the notes.
[349:54.61]Need a key.
[350:20.90]Is there a key?
[350:21.56]There's a key!
[350:28.40]This one's pretty cool though.
[350:30.10]You use room key 205.
[350:40.34]Security room... what does that say?
[350:43.65]No escape.
[350:47.46]Hey, shouldn't have to keep posting on a board that no one even uses anymore.
[350:50.52]I'm tired of cleaning up your messes.
[350:52.70]Either help me find the spare monitor room key or release by the hotel a fire axe, dummy.
[350:58.68]That's from Jay.
[351:05.65]No way out.
[351:12.15]Picked up a bear of burdens.
[351:22.49]Was this 208?
[351:26.07]Bathroom.
[351:32.95]Board on Subject 31B, Maris Summers.
[351:37.76]Patient seems to be stable.
[351:39.10]Sleep for now, but she's getting restless about a music box.
[351:42.02]We're currently cleaning that thing so she can keep whining about it.
[351:46.18]Anyway, we are now closer than ever to a new milestone.
[351:49.78]If we keep this up, we will have this project locked up by the end of the week.
[351:52.56]I'll update you as we move ahead, Dr. Olfan.
[351:56.74]Okay.
[351:57.02]Okay, dig in.
[352:05.99]Uh... Fish of failed pasts.
[352:11.93]Okay.
[352:16.33]You see those failed fishes?
[352:18.12]Nice.
[352:25.35]Leave now.
[352:26.99]Sin.
[352:27.33]Is that supposed to be me?
[352:35.58]I don't think I have a weapon or anything.
[352:41.18]What?
[352:42.20]Wait, wait.
[352:42.46]Is somebody chasing me?
[352:44.22]Somebody's coming this way.
[352:46.67]Oh god.
[352:47.35]How do I get out of here?
[352:50.73]I don't have any... What am I supposed to do?
[352:55.05]I don't know what the code is.
[352:55.87]What was the code?
[352:59.13]Code?
[353:23.44]It's not the door number.
[353:26.28]Sin?
[353:27.00]Five?
[353:28.44]One?
[353:51.20]Hey!
[353:57.08]Whoa!
[353:58.60]What the hell is that?
[354:02.09]I don't know it yet.
[354:03.77]Check the fuck off!
[354:05.05]My god! 315.
[354:26.55]There's a Jerma one guy over here.
[354:27.79]Kinda.
[354:57.96]A few broken locks.
[354:59.25]Yeah, yeah, I already got it.
[355:00.77]Okay.
[355:04.01]Dog of Sorrows.
[355:11.17]Oh, great.
[355:21.94]three animals were locked in a hotel dog took a break from escaping the fish means for survival were down the toilet and the bear climbed up a tree to see an escape route out a window I already have all skip for sake I'm shaking and crying and pissing you need to calm down
[356:07.97]Is that me doing that?
[356:26.07]Hey!
[356:27.05]Oh, this one's actually pretty good.
[356:35.31]Hey.
[356:39.50]Hey.
[356:41.28]Yeah, let me stop this guy.
[356:43.16]Hey.
[356:44.24]Hey.
[356:48.72]Oh, wait, I got out.
[356:55.39]Come closer.
[357:00.22]So close.
[357:00.96]Huh?
[357:03.18]What does that do?
[357:34.60]Oh, look at that.
[357:38.64]210?
[357:38.70]I can't.
[357:39.09]It's blocked up.
[357:39.73]I have no idea.
[358:18.35]Solve the riddle and look for something to break the boards with.
[358:22.40]Whoa, what?
[358:36.36]I don't know.
[358:57.33]I gotta pee.
[359:11.11]Can I do anything with him?
[359:15.09]Oh, wait.
[359:15.93]Past sins will let you in.
[359:21.91]Past sins will let you ins.
[359:30.42]Sin.
[359:42.82]The ritual is complete.
[359:43.86]It seems the old gods have accepted Mara as an offering.
[359:46.44]This is great news!
[359:48.92]Now we just wait for our divine gift to be granted to us.
[359:51.38]As for our little sacrifice, seems like a side effect of the ritual where horrid white boils on her skin.
[359:58.91]Oh well.
[359:59.57]It's the cost of progress.
[360:02.79]Room 208 key.
[360:06.63]It's kind of creepy.
[360:07.23]208 is, um... We're over here, right?
[360:27.16]Fire axe.
[360:30.36]Use equipped item with R2.
[360:31.22]I think I'm gonna have to fight.
[360:36.35]Oh god.
[360:47.10]Kill him?
[360:47.46]I'm gonna try.
[361:04.18]I don't think that's the guy.
[361:09.70]I may have bugged the game out somehow.
[361:33.07]Now what?
[361:40.42]Music box collected.
[361:44.04]Whoa!
[361:44.36]Alright, that was weird.
[361:49.74]Music box.
[362:03.36]Were there more boards to break over here?
[362:18.40]Toilet.
[362:27.32]Security room key.
[362:28.58]We're almost done.
[362:29.06]Where's the security room?
[362:39.09]It's all the way back here.
[362:48.95]Dude, I'm fairly certain.
[362:49.83]That thing's supposed to be scaring me.
[362:52.96]He's supposed to be popping up behind me.
[362:54.40]I think I may have broken him, though.
[362:58.66]Computers... Is password protected?
[363:01.29]Oh, I just fucking burped.
[363:02.89]And choked.
[363:07.65]As a valued customer, we want to assure you the best in quality from our amazing team of experts.
[363:12.63]We have set up the lock on room 211 as per your request.
[363:16.45]The code is 261.
[363:17.29]Thank you for your patience.
[363:21.77]What the hell are you doing?
[363:24.03]What was that?
[363:27.61]What the fuck was that?
[363:28.71]That was just pretty scary.
[363:33.53]I'm so sorry they roped me into it.
[363:34.97]Forgive me.
[363:35.37]I think it was huge.
[363:47.74]This is a good one.
[363:53.27]Boss told me to dispose of the key to the server room.
[363:55.53]Guess he doesn't want anyone opening the locked 211.
[363:57.07]More of his obsession to make sure no one destroys his little experiment.
[364:01.77]I'm over the stench permeating through this place is foul.
[364:05.48]Through the key in the boarded up stall in the bathroom.
[364:07.24]Yeah, we already got it.
[364:09.20]No, don't fucking...
[364:21.03]Sinks?
[364:21.77]Sins manifest here.
[364:28.23]No, guys, that's not me making that noise.
[364:30.69]It's... 261.
[364:38.49]Let's go.
[364:51.54]Out, out, out, out, out.
[365:04.93]Song of Sorrows.
[365:06.17]Collect it.
[365:07.35]I got it?
[365:12.02]So what, can I leave?
[365:25.88]Let's go!
[365:26.78]I can't believe you've done it.
[365:33.25]You are actually dumb enough to think she would allow you to leave.
[365:37.57]You thought someone was helping you along the way.
[365:41.37]Now, I'm just trying to get her thoughts made real by Mara.
[365:47.92]I'll see if you can come and look for her in the offering.
[365:58.06]Did you guys like that?
[366:01.00]I'm trying a different voice for you guys.
[366:12.93]Project Hill Redux.
[366:18.73]Special thanks.
[366:20.39]Pat.
[366:21.37]Dax.
[366:21.99]Quinn.
[366:23.49]All of them.
[366:25.53]No, that was good.
[366:27.61]That was good.
[366:32.68]That was a really nice beginning, middle, and end.
[366:34.86]It was great.
[366:36.04]And this is kind of morbid, but... The Grape Escape Level 3 is a gummy ship level.
[366:50.87]And I'm going to skip it, because that will actually make me puke.
[366:58.85]Gone Rogue!
[367:08.92]Lightsabers?
[367:09.54]Is this a Star Wars game?
[367:16.83]PW Power 87% Error 0.
[367:18.53]I think it's just a little short film.
[367:36.51]Slice?
[367:37.81]Maybe?
[367:39.67]Come out of freeze frame and slice.
[367:47.18]That thing's got a lot of errors.
[368:03.93]Press play on the movie?
[368:04.93]We're watching it, so wait, hold on.
[368:10.57]I think that may have been it.
[368:15.60]Gone rogue.
[368:19.66]Maybe there's more.
[368:20.32]Is it just playing again?
[368:26.32]I think it's repeating.
[368:32.76]We're watching it again.
[368:33.70]Alright, we're gonna... That was cool.
[368:35.89]I think we already saw Spring Forest.
[368:42.27]It looped, yeah.
[368:42.99]I love the red guy's stance.
[368:50.86]We're going to get a download of this video.
[368:52.12]It's so hot.
[368:52.76]I don't know.
[368:55.72]From the internet somewhere.
[369:00.45]This is really pretty.
[369:14.68]Alright, I think we're going to be getting to the end of the stream here.
[369:19.08]And the end of this autosurf.
[369:29.40]This looks fantastic.
[369:33.58]I want that.
[369:34.58]No, I want to go back to that.
[369:38.54]Unknown island in the Indian Ocean.
[369:51.62]So, I'm gonna spend the rest of the evening... I'm gonna get some food first.
[369:56.08]I'm fading, I don't know why.
[370:00.69]I'm gonna make a bunch of shit.
[370:02.51]As much as I can.
[370:03.93]For tomorrow.
[370:08.55]If I run into a snag... We'll see.
[370:17.27]Then we'll do Salmon Max.
[370:18.79]But I'm gonna try.
[370:31.43]This is nice.
[370:37.42]Streamed Legends?
[370:38.00]Yeah, we'll do Streamed Legends in a minute.
[370:47.33]I'm gonna get Battle Royale.
[370:52.93]Do a full stream where you finish Season 1.
[370:55.77]That's probably the plan.
[370:56.41]Because we got two and a half episodes through last time.
[371:00.22]I'm assuming we'll do two and a half episodes again.
[371:04.36]Go away.
[371:04.92]Alright.
[371:19.51]Am I going to play Mordhau?
[371:21.67]Yeah.
[371:23.91]I'll do that later this week.
[371:27.65]I think that's the end of that.
[371:28.49]That's just Fireman.
[371:38.14]Wow.
[371:38.42]Look at the background.
[371:42.74]It's Mega Man and Fireman.
[371:44.62]Pick up after your dog.
[371:46.73]Max penalty is 50 coins.
[371:48.71]What?
[372:00.22]That was a blind jump I should have done that
[372:37.67]So is Mordhau any good?
[372:40.26]It looks really fun.
[372:42.00]It's like another chivalry, right?
[372:43.22]But not chivalry.
[372:44.80]Alright, let me... I gotta look.
[372:46.31]It's gonna be hard to do that.
[372:50.57]I can't see where the jump is.
[372:51.45]It's just gonna fall off that, kind of?
[372:53.62]Like a little spike?
[373:20.23]auto surf complete 30 creations let us know what you think alright what was the best one starry night was great that's thumbs up already battle tops I died too quickly haunted mansion I didn't really get it was alright this one was cool but I died too quickly dog run is the thumbs up already that'll be solid now car drift uh this one yes thumbs that one up

[373:53.18]No, this one was cool.
[373:55.68]It was really well made.
[373:58.10]That was a cool background.
[373:59.28]Treasure Hunt.
[373:59.82]I don't really remember what the hell this one was.
[374:03.92]Roller Coaster.
[374:04.58]Is this a kinetic one?
[374:05.90]No.
[374:08.99]Purple Pants Surprise Episode 5.
[374:10.63]No.
[374:15.90]This was great, already thumbs up.
[374:18.24]This one was also great, and I want to make sure I thumbs it up.
[374:21.80]Great Escape, I don't even remember this one.
[374:29.57]Project Hill, right, yeah, this one was, that was the one that was good.
[374:33.79]Gone Rogue, top 10.
[374:39.77]I mean, top 10.
[374:40.65]I don't know what that means.
[374:49.53]Number one.
[374:50.27]Well, there you go.
[374:59.92]Two serfs.
[375:03.70]I think I leveled up to level five, which means I can probably do all the tutorials.
[375:06.75]Oh, look at you.
[375:08.85]This is your aura.
[375:11.23]Your creativity grows and evolves.
[375:13.91]Your aura will change to reflect your activities.
[375:17.77]You can become a specialist at one aspect of dreams.
[375:21.39]What?
[375:21.91]Or dabble in every area as you like.
[375:23.99]I have to pick a specialization?
[375:26.62]So you can combine your talents and make something amazing together.
[375:34.93]Oh, no.
[375:41.25]What do I want to specialize in?
[375:46.76]Level 8!
[375:49.94]Yeah, but I only... You like to play.
[375:53.24]You're an explorer of digital worlds.
[375:54.82]You may not spend all your time playing, but it's what makes you special in the Dreamiverse.
[376:00.05]Without you, our Dreamcrafters would have no audience.
[376:02.91]We salute you.
[376:05.67]My specialization is watching TV.
[376:12.63]Alright, cool.
[376:15.41]Alright, guys.
[376:17.21]I'm going to put some more time into this and I'm going to get some stuff done.
[376:20.64]See if we can get at least a couple interesting things for tomorrow.
[376:27.18]If not, if I still want to put time into it and I want to work on it, then we'll see by tomorrow.
[376:34.47]I will do Salmon Max instead.
[376:35.82]Or Mordhau, whatever is more interesting to me at the time.
[376:41.78]And we will set a date.
[376:45.24]If I open this shit up and it's like, no way am I gonna finish this in like five days.
[376:50.82]Play Rat City?
[376:51.58]Alright, I'll play Rat City.
[377:02.42]What the hell is it?
[377:02.94]I'm probably going to have to search for it.
[377:09.48]Rat City.
[377:14.50]Rat?
[377:14.70]No, not Rat K. Rat City.
[377:21.55]Welcome to the bustling metropolis of Rat City!
[377:25.15]Found it.
[377:33.72]You're not finishing day one?
[377:34.60]What do you mean?
[377:38.46]Probably not, but it's worth a try.
[377:40.98]It's worth a shot.
[377:55.89]Am I cat or am I a rat?
[377:57.79]I am a rat, okay.
[378:13.50]Can I do... what can I... can I do anything?
[378:14.98]Uh, I'm not sure I can do much here.
[378:29.84]Oh.
[378:31.29]No, that just toggles noir mode.
[378:33.01]Okay.
[378:34.91]Anybody have any quests or anything for me?
[378:47.22]Maybe not.
[379:02.07]It's just scenery.
[379:02.95]Yeah, that's what it looks like.
[379:06.01]Still cool, though.
[379:20.19]Make a community dream?
[379:21.15]That would actually be really fun.
[379:22.09]Make a community dreams game.
[379:30.58]I think it has to be out for a little longer, though.
[379:33.22]And it actually needs to release.
[379:36.22]When does it even release?
[379:37.16]I don't know.
[379:49.34]Oh, nice like apartment.
[379:51.85]Rat apartment.
[379:52.67]Nice.
[379:55.09]That's cool.
[380:05.26]Why am I wearing a diaper?
[380:07.20]I mean, I think that's just kind of a rat.
[380:13.92]Hey, get out of my way.
[380:20.48]Everyone's just hanging out, sleeping.
[380:28.98]The art's nice.
[380:29.70]The build?
[380:30.70]Nice, too.
[380:32.97]This is cool.
[380:40.51]Well, we got, I mean, we have to see what's all the way up there.
[380:46.09]Is it, can I sprint or anything?
[381:03.37]What's over here?
[381:04.49]Another apartment.
[381:06.46]Dice.
[381:06.84]This really is my home, huh?
[381:09.24]Don't fall off.
[381:11.00]If you push me off, I'm going to be really mad.
[381:13.60]He almost did.
[381:14.20]What else have we got?
[381:20.14]Go down?
[381:22.82]Up?
[381:24.44]Let's go up.
[381:36.84]Jump, jump, jump.
[381:40.26]Half-Life.
[381:45.24]Are you aware that the Rat song has been used on TikTok a lot lately?
[381:49.00]Really?
[381:50.16]Why?
[381:50.48]Oh, that was it.
[381:52.95]I escaped Rat City.
[381:54.17]Give it a thumbs up.
[381:54.85]Of course I will.
[382:02.95]Very cool.
[382:11.70]You're not getting royalties?
[382:12.64]No, I don't sell it.
[382:14.80]I want to get royalties, but I don't sell.
[382:17.60]Alright, guys.
[382:19.00]I'll see you tomorrow.
[382:20.14]If we don't do this, we'll do Salmon Max.
[382:28.09]Or something else.
[382:28.93]We'll figure it out.
[382:31.93]I'm going to see if I can put some stuff together.
[382:35.90]See what I can get done by tomorrow.
[382:37.50]But regardless, there'll be a stream tomorrow.
[382:38.82]I'll see you tomorrow.
[382:43.77]Thanks for sticking around.
[382:44.53]It's good to be back.
[382:48.37]The mom vacation went well.
[382:50.05]It's getting a little late, so we can end here.
[382:54.33]We'll go through the bits.
[382:55.41]I'm going to pee one more time.
[382:57.41]That's probably a good idea.
[382:58.47]So I'll see you guys in a little bit.
[383:02.63]Be right back.
[383:04.10]Have a great night, if you're leaving.
[385:31.18]Hey!
[385:34.00]So, uh, let's put this off of BRB.
[385:38.14]And on to... G2G!
[385:40.60]What do you say?
[385:46.37]See you tomorrow.
[385:55.93]Let's go back a little bit.
[385:58.55]In the bit department.
[386:02.70]This is from about six plus hours ago now.
[386:08.34]Jess, you got it.
[386:09.02]Thanks for the $2.50.
[386:11.63]Was bestowed the gift of the flu this morning.
[386:16.39]Happy to see you back to ease the sick.
[386:19.55]Hope you enjoyed the time off.
[386:20.71]I did.
[386:23.07]Sorry to hear that you're not feeling well.
[386:27.17]Get some sleep.
[386:28.59]Have some soup.
[386:31.91]I would say those are the recommendations.
[386:35.60]But thank you for the $2.50.
[386:36.16]Uh, thank you OhMyGodTayon for the $5.00.
[386:41.78]Hey Jerma, it's been a while since I last donated, but I promise you I have been avidly... Ah, no, that's the wrong one.
[386:49.59]Just, uh, stream live just jumped up right there.
[386:51.87]It's this one!
[386:53.77]During your time off, I came to a very important realization.
[386:56.49]I love you, Jerma.
[386:57.37]Every day you were gone was painful and agonizing.
[387:00.71]Can't imagine my life without you.
[387:02.47]Thought about this long and hard, and I can only think of one solution, so here I go.
[387:05.70]Jeremy Elbertson, will you marry me?
[387:08.60]No pressure or anything, but if you say no, I'll be very sad.
[387:13.40]Uh, well, I'm gonna have to respectfully decline.
[387:19.12]Because I don't marry people I don't know.
[387:24.87]That's probably not a good idea.
[387:29.81]So I'm very sorry.
[387:32.97]Evil streamer.
[387:34.09]Marry a stranger that you've never met.
[387:36.57]Do it!
[387:44.78]If you married them, you'd get to know them.
[387:47.84]I guess that's true.
[387:51.00]But thank you for the $5.
[387:56.49]YDNA, thanks for the $10.
[387:57.93]Dad is back.
[388:00.23]I have returned.
[388:00.77]I have returned.
[388:07.43]Thank you for the $10, YDNA.
[388:10.17]Really appreciate it.
[388:10.83]Thank you.
[388:15.48]Also, thank you, Dork Cube, for the $2.50.
[388:20.56]Hope you had a good time away.
[388:21.82]I actually took the opportunity to see my sister this week.
[388:25.13]This weekend.
[388:25.65]And we went to this exhibit with preserved human bodies with, like, guts exposed and stuff.
[388:32.05]jermaDisgust.
[388:32.93]Anyway, I'm glad you're back.
[388:36.12]Um... Preserved human bodies?
[388:41.72]I think I know what you're talking about.
[388:42.74]Yeah, it's like an exhibit, uh... I forget what it's called.
[388:50.53]They have a bunch of organs and a standing up kind of body worlds.
[388:57.39]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[389:01.12]It's like, uh... I remember seeing advertisements for it.
[389:03.84]They had it here for a while.
[389:06.22]I don't remember how long it was here for.
[389:10.86]It seemed interesting.
[389:14.09]I feel like I've seen it before, too, a long time ago.
[389:21.12]Yeah.
[389:21.56]Hope you had a good time.
[389:24.33]Good to be back.
[389:28.63]Bodies the exhibition.
[389:30.31]That is what it is.
[389:33.45]Thank you to Slashda.
[389:35.77]Slashda for the 10 bucks.
[389:37.71]Jerma, just wanted to give you some thanks for the many years of entertainment you've given me and this awesome community.
[389:43.03]Much love and respect, man.
[389:44.83]And I am always excited to see what you have in store for us next.
[389:47.75]Jerma Hart.
[389:49.15]Also wanted to let you know that you're popular enough to make it on an outro for a future funk album.
[389:54.84]Which is actually why I had to pick up this record.
[389:58.44]Future funk album.
[390:01.10]What does that mean?
[390:02.62]Wait, what?
[390:03.02]Let me see here.
[390:09.98]What, did somebody sample something?
[390:14.18]Just make a damn album already.
[390:16.04]I'm not talented enough to do that.
[390:22.57]Let's see... Come on, I need to... Where's my audio?
[390:31.26]Why is this coming through my monitor?
[390:34.04]That's weird.
[390:40.61]speakers there we go why is it it's over what the hell now this is not coming through here there we go uh you know what it's over I'll tell you right now no I'm gonna put my foot down it's over what drugs are you on today
[391:16.94]It's over.
[391:21.94]Well, there you go.
[391:23.40]Alright, that's cool.
[391:28.10]Very cool.
[391:31.01]I wasn't on any drugs.
[391:37.75]It's called, uh, Enough Sleep, I guess.
[391:43.19]Uh, thank you, Tadoff Swifler, for the $50.
[391:47.53]$50 earlier.
[391:47.93]I missed it.
[391:49.29]But thank you for the 50 bucks.
[391:51.07]It's a lot of money.
[391:51.87]They say, hey, Jeremiah donated a month ago during Sekiro, but somebody... one guy got mad at my name and reported me.
[392:02.57]So I got banned for 30 days.
[392:06.88]Here's some bits back.
[392:07.92]Keep up the great stream.
[392:11.54]Wait, hold on.
[392:12.44]If you got banned for 30 days, how do you still have the name?
[392:17.83]They've banned you for 30 days, but they let you keep the name.
[392:29.22]That seems a little odd.
[392:32.02]Well, uh... That doesn't make very much sense.
[392:41.43]But thank you for the $50, it's a lot of money.
[392:44.99]And you got refunded for the bits.
[392:55.17]Maybe he's still banned.
[392:56.47]I don't think so.
[392:59.65]But thank you so much for the money.
[393:01.09]That's a lot of money.
[393:05.61]Where's the donate option?
[393:07.40]I don't do PayPal donations or anything.
[393:11.04]I have bits or subs.
[393:13.18]I don't do the PayPal thing.
[393:21.68]But thank you.
[393:25.34]Thank you Tyler Mike for the 250.
[393:26.94]Hey Jerma, last stream I mentioned that Vinny had complimented you, and it seemed like you hadn't seen the clip, so here you go.
[393:31.98]It's very wholesome.
[393:33.60]Also, if you watch it, make sure to watch the entire clip.
[393:37.76]I think we have seen this one.
[393:39.62]Vinny, I'm sure someone already told you, but Jerma said you're one of his favorite streamers.
[393:45.61]I hear Jerma's doing an AMA at the moment, so I want to pay back the compliment.
[393:50.81]I don't watch a lot of live streams.
[393:52.49]I watch more YouTube videos these days.
[393:55.86]But Jerma is one of my favorite people I've ever met that does what I do.
[394:02.00]And he's also one of my favorite streamers.
[394:04.97]He's also drunk.
[394:06.03]Okay, he probably won't mean that.
[394:08.57]No, I do.
[394:09.27]I did.
[394:12.27]No, I do.
[394:12.95]I really did mean that.
[394:15.45]Anyway, goodbye for now.
[394:17.85]Take a quick break.
[394:19.62]You can't preface.
[394:20.54]You can't be like, oh, he's drunk, though.
[394:22.02]I was genuinely upset when Jerma was not at PAX this year.
[394:26.41]As stupid as that may sound.
[394:27.67]But he's a really good dude.
[394:28.83]We get along.
[394:29.45]It's a New York-Boston thing, I think.
[394:33.07]No, I think he's great.
[394:37.51]How come I, because I had a few drinks, all of a sudden that negates literally everything I said?
[394:42.00]No.
[394:43.22]I stand by it.
[394:43.84]I mean it.
[394:44.62]I meant it.
[394:53.28]You've ruined his PAX experience.
[394:55.24]Well, I'm sorry.
[394:56.18]I just couldn't.
[394:57.02]I couldn't go this year.
[395:03.24]But thank you, Tyler Mike.
[395:05.46]FerodianWeapon, thanks for the $2.50.
[395:07.45]Hope you enjoyed your vacation.
[395:08.73]Good to have you back.
[395:10.61]Yeah, it was good.
[395:12.13]It was very good.
[395:18.13]Spent a lot of time with family, so it was nice.
[395:22.94]Lo-Fi Space Cowboy, thanks for the three dollars.
[395:26.24]Four dollars, actually.
[395:27.16]Am I ever gonna play Monster Hunter again?
[395:31.26]I don't think so.
[395:33.41]I don't think I'll be playing Monster Hunter again.
[395:35.07]I completed the story off-stream.
[395:41.99]I got kind of what I wanted out of it.
[395:44.49]And even at this DLC, I'm not sure I would go back to it.
[395:48.49]Monster Rancher, though.
[395:50.05]Monster Rancher, that's a different story.
[395:59.26]You'll probably see that again.
[396:00.14]Because we have to beat it.
[396:03.80]But thanks for the $4, Lo-Fi.
[396:05.48]Space Cowboy.
[396:08.00]Millhouse701, thanks for the $5.
[396:10.53]Rat Movie The Game.
[396:11.75]It might take a while, but I could probably throw something together.
[396:18.33]We'll see.
[396:19.23]I'm not going to get too over my head with this.
[396:21.71]I just know that I want to try.
[396:25.05]Princess Universe, thanks for the $5.
[396:28.61]There's no waiting for the soy boy.
[396:31.86]We did it.
[396:32.66]We did.
[396:33.18]I showed it.
[396:36.18]Meef Pleeble, thanks for the $2.50.
[396:37.14]Hey, Jim, what kind of a sad donation tonight.
[396:40.38]But my sister just got diagnosed with colitis.
[396:43.51]Any tips for her?
[396:44.47]Thanks, big guy.
[396:45.69]You'll always be the best streamer.
[396:48.33]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[396:49.51]It's a really, really annoying illness.
[396:54.38]The best advice I could give to somebody that gets diagnosed with colitis is to have a more basic diet for a little while and kind of start introducing foods again to see what kind of throws you off, what makes you feel better.
[397:13.91]It's hard to tell if you just kind of keep eating the same things you normally eat.
[397:24.23]But they've come pretty far with the whole colitis and medicine.
[397:32.67]There are things that can really keep people in remission for a while.
[397:40.08]I'm sorry to hear that, though.
[397:43.32]Hopefully she can manage it.
[397:50.68]Thanks for the $2.50.
[397:53.48]I missed another 50.
[397:54.12]How did I miss this many?
[397:55.49]Oh, I know why.
[397:56.15]It's because my PlayStation 4 audio is pumping through, not my desktop audio.
[398:01.33]It's another $50 from Lorag.
[398:04.23]Thanks to the $50.
[398:05.13]5,000 bits.
[398:08.03]Is this the guy who beat Gork on stream?
[398:10.63]It is.
[398:13.08]It is.
[398:14.34]But thank you, Lorag.
[398:16.48]Sorry, I missed these.
[398:17.30]I'm usually pretty on top of that.
[398:18.96]He's a god gamer.
[398:22.30]Thank you, dude.
[398:24.62]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[398:27.24]Shalashashka.
[398:28.53]Shalashashka.
[398:29.37]Thanks for the 250.
[398:31.43]252.
[398:33.09]I may be being a one guy, but I think you could make a Castle Griffinsteed 2 with dreams.
[398:38.07]I don't know.
[398:38.51]I probably could.
[398:42.60]Or at least a Castle Griffinsteed 1 epilogue.
[398:46.44]Because that would take a very long time to have, I think, like a full 30 to 20, 30 plus minute experience.
[398:54.00]We'll see.
[398:56.94]Bingo Sunshine, thanks for the five bucks.
[398:59.06]Glad you're back, Jerma.
[399:00.18]Long time no see, but please consider revisiting Oblivion smooches to auto.
[399:09.43]Oblivion.
[399:11.65]Yeah.
[399:13.80]Oblivion just sits in one of those weird spots where I can't put it anywhere and I can't do it because there's always something else that I think I'd rather do.
[399:22.96]Eventually, I'm gonna run out of stuff that I would rather or start doing.
[399:27.00]And Oblivion's gonna come back.
[399:29.14]Some of these games that I haven't played in a long time... Guys, once we play them all, what happens when I play them all?
[399:33.45]What happens when I play all video games?
[399:35.13]I'm gonna have to play Oblivion.
[399:37.87]You know, like another... 500 streams.
[399:42.08]I'm gonna play every video game.
[399:44.46]I'm gonna do everything.
[399:45.88]I'm gonna have to play it at some point.
[399:54.08]But thank you.
[399:55.56]I do think about Oblivion sometimes.
[399:57.50]But not recently.
[400:01.96]Uh, Clowercy.
[400:03.36]Thank you, Clowercy.
[400:04.76]Or Clowers.
[400:06.28]For the three bucks.
[400:08.79]They say, Jerma lied about enabling Pog.
[400:14.43]Also, enable Ayaya or I will literally scream at you for not being cute.
[400:19.99]Much love and kisses to you, streamer with a strange face.
[400:25.37]Why do I have a strange face?
[400:26.61]I'm not going to put... I'm not going to activate... Ayaya.
[400:35.80]I'm not going to enable pog.
[400:36.88]I already have pog.
[400:38.54]We've got a good pog already.
[400:39.92]We've got two pogs here.
[400:45.56]I need to... I've got to go back and look at what I have for emotes there.
[400:50.40]Look, yeah.
[400:51.00]Look at that pog.
[400:52.42]That's a good pog.
[400:53.46]We don't need another one.
[400:57.84]But thank you.
[401:02.46]Thank you so much for the $3.
[401:05.68]Let's get the credits rolling.
[401:08.30]There were a lot of resubs tonight.
[401:10.26]I've been gone for like 8 or 9 days.
[401:12.00]So there was a lot of resubs.
[401:13.06]Thank you guys for continuing to support the stream.

[401:42.13]So, thank you for that.
