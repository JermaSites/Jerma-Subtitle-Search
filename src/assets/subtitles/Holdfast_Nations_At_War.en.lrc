[00:03.22]Nah, nah, there's no stream.
[00:04.38]I fat-fingered it.
[00:06.02]No stream today, I fat-fingered it.
[00:07.48]That wasn't supposed to happen.
[00:08.46]Ah, fat-finger.
[00:10.50]I wanted to press 8 and I pressed 0, 8, 4, and 6.
[00:14.10]I'm sorry, guy.
[00:16.89]Let me, uh, just very quickly... Well, I mean, gonna have to do a stream now, right?
[00:25.95]Gonna have to do it now.
[00:28.46]No, this is supposed to happen.
[00:29.85]Give me a minute.
[00:30.25]I'm going to tweet it out.
[00:31.80]See you in like two seconds.
[00:33.52]Be right back.
[01:07.82]Okay, so... Today... Probably wondering why we're starting so early.
[01:14.50]That's because I have a doctor's appointment today.
[01:17.86]That I have to go to.
[01:19.60]And that appointment is at 8 o'clock.
[01:22.24]So I figured... If I have to do a doctor's appointment, then let's start early.
[01:28.14]Try to get a couple hours in.
[01:29.13]At least two or three hours here.
[01:32.01]And...
[01:33.67]We'll see how it goes.
[01:34.41]We're gonna play Holdfast.
[01:36.31]Which is a... I almost just said Lapoleonic.
[01:40.51]Napoleonic video game where there could be 150 people on a server.
[01:44.25]It's a third person, first person shooter multiplayer game.
[01:50.09]Think of Battlefield, right?
[01:51.19]Battlefield 3.
[01:53.07]You can fly planes.
[01:56.16]No, there's no planes in this game.
[01:57.26]But there are boats.
[01:58.74]Seems interesting.
[01:59.26]There's like 15 classes.
[02:08.25]Oh, God.
[02:09.77]I can't believe.
[02:11.11]So this ain't just a weekend meme, huh?
[02:13.97]This is going to be put into the textbook.
[02:16.19]This is going to go into the annals of history here.
[02:19.03]This meme is going to go into the textbook.
[02:20.70]It's been more than like three days.
[02:29.72]I hope not.
[02:30.98]Yeah, I hope this does not get in there.
[02:39.26]Anyways, by the way, tonight is the last night you're allowed to vote in the emote contest.
[02:46.62]And by the way, let me just touch upon this very, very briefly.
[02:52.88]There are some people that have... I've taken a snapshot a few times, so don't worry, I can talk about this.
[03:00.45]There are some people that thought that they could manipulate the vote.
[03:03.99]But what they don't realize is I have every single response that has been recorded.
[03:11.15]Every single one.
[03:12.77]I can see when you vote for the same emote like 45 times.
[03:16.97]So, I can just remove them.
[03:20.82]This is survey.
[03:21.88]I spent $400 on this service.
[03:24.42]You don't think there's going to be stuff like that and I can see that shit?
[03:27.88]I can see every single one.
[03:31.44]So, there has been a little bit of meddling here, but I know exactly what I'm doing with it, so don't worry.
[03:44.29]Just know that if you've been cheating, your vote will not be counted.
[03:50.24]Every single one of those.
[03:51.52]I can remove them all.
[03:52.34]I can see them all.
[04:01.31]Big brother.
[04:06.53]Prove it.
[04:06.99]I'm not going to prove it.
[04:08.91]Because that compromises everything.
[04:13.33]That will compromise the whole operation if I tell you how I can see it.
[04:19.29]But just know I know.
[04:21.70]If I need to prove it, I will.
[04:23.44]But I don't have to right now.
[04:28.67]Probably shouldn't have said that until the vote is over.
[04:30.35]Well, I took a snapshot.
[04:32.01]So I know exactly what was in the right place.
[04:33.97]And it doesn't even matter because, like I said, I could just go in and delete all these potentially manipulated responses.
[04:41.43]So it's not a big deal.
[04:42.82]I actually just have to remove them.
[04:45.88]Not a problem.
[04:49.64]But if you haven't voted yet...
[04:52.96]Please vote.
[04:55.36]Just don't do a bunch of bullshit to vote 150 times.
[05:00.73]And it's unfortunate that that person... There's a few in particular that have tried to do this at least a couple hundred times.
[05:06.49]And I'm sorry, but you've wasted all your time.
[05:09.81]I'm just deleting the 199 of those.
[05:10.81]I'm sorry.
[05:20.61]This is not just, like, strawpole.me.
[05:25.48]They use SurveyMonkey to collect data on people.
[05:28.88]I got all your data.
[05:32.10]I know what your favorite food is.
[05:34.80]And a lot of you, for some reason, I don't know why, popcorn is number one.
[05:38.56]How?
[05:39.10]Why?
[05:40.14]Shrimp was number two.
[05:42.14]And number three was acid.
[05:46.66]Alright.
[05:48.04]Alright, let's go.
[05:49.70]Stop drinking acid.
[05:54.72]Long story short, I can tell when you're manipulating if you're trying as hard as you can to do it.
[05:58.88]Just, it don't even matter.
[06:01.99]Good luck.
[06:03.71]Alright.
[06:07.42]Oh, no, okay, I get it.
[06:08.79]So it's popcorn shrimp in acid.
[06:11.83]But the acid they're talking about is probably like a vinaigrette, right?
[06:16.53]I can see that.
[06:17.25]Okay, no, so that makes sense.
[06:20.33]That's the number one food in the world.
[06:23.43]Hey, look, there we are.
[06:24.29]Let's turn on the audio.
[06:28.74]So how this works is if you have Holdfast...
[06:36.37]No, it's hydralonic acid.
[06:40.05]As opposed... As opposed to what?
[06:43.51]The Basie foods?
[06:48.51]By the way, vinegar's gross.
[06:50.93]Vinegar's disgusting.
[06:53.03]Why would anybody put that on anything?
[06:54.25]Alright, this is the one we're going to.
[06:56.11]I have no idea how to play this game.
[07:00.47]All I know is it's going to be probably kind of fun.
[07:11.13]Vinegar smells awful and tastes even worse.
[07:16.63]It hits all the wrong notes.
[07:26.48]Alright, let's see.
[07:27.00]Fraction.
[07:27.64]Let's be... Is that spelled wrong?
[07:33.40]Does that say Brishian?
[07:33.99]Brishian?
[07:42.11]Fraction?
[07:43.57]What fraction do you want to join?
[07:46.38]We can be the Brytians, or we can be the Fransees.
[07:49.34]Let's be the Brytians.
[07:51.96]Hmm.
[07:53.56]And, uh, you can select boats, too.
[07:57.06]Gunboat, one gun.
[07:58.02]Are there little boats?
[08:00.08]I'm going to go on the Furnace.
[08:02.85]And I'm going to be the Officer.
[08:04.65]No, Sailor.
[08:06.87]Just join the round.
[08:08.87]Do I actually get to fly around in this thing?
[08:13.98]How little is the boat?
[08:18.36]Oh, that's because I have to select it.
[08:19.44]I think a bunch of people have to join first.
[08:25.81]There's two furnaces so far.
[08:29.79]This isn't Peter Pan.
[08:30.87]What do you mean it's not Peter Pan?
[08:35.78]Should I just... Are we good?
[08:37.98]What's going on here?
[08:48.43]This game, no, it's not free to play, unfortunately.
[08:52.97]It does look fairly fun, though.
[09:02.90]Let's go, okay, I can click, there we go, alright.
[09:06.52]Whoa!
[09:07.62]Whoa, hey!
[09:12.27]Are you fine?
[09:13.09]Are you done with that?
[09:15.25]Okay.
[09:16.29]What, what are you doing?
[09:18.98]I can't look up.
[09:20.34]If I look up, then my screen... Okay, can't do that.
[09:34.42]No, don't everybody spawn on this boat.
[09:39.49]There's no friendly fire.
[09:42.35]Oh my god.
[09:43.23]Alright, we're gonna have to turn that off.
[09:46.76]Where is it?
[09:48.22]It's like, it's called dirt or something.
[09:49.59]Where, where, where?
[09:52.49]Dirt.
[09:53.25]Uh, let's turn off the lens flare.
[09:54.83]Depth of field.
[09:55.79]Sharper image.
[09:57.33]Sun rays.
[09:57.98]It's called dirt.
[09:59.10]Where is it?
[09:59.82]I know it's called dirt.
[10:02.82]Dirt level.
[10:14.98]Cannonball trails.
[10:16.14]Dirt level.
[10:17.56]Lens dirt.
[10:18.08]It's already off.
[10:20.07]Alright, so we got four of us.
[10:22.67]Let's go attack it.
[10:24.05]Okay.
[10:26.39]That's actually getting fairly annoying.
[10:28.05]How do I change?
[10:28.71]Okay.
[10:38.31]I don't like the fact that I can't look.
[10:39.73]Don't dunk us.
[10:42.13]Oh my god.
[10:43.53]That's so horrible.
[10:50.74]Fuck God and glory.
[10:52.16]Alright.
[10:54.38]Hey!
[10:57.92]Fuck King George!
[10:59.44]Fuck King George!
[11:00.64]Fuck God!
[11:02.72]Fuck them all!
[11:09.83]Fuck King and country!
[11:14.57]Hey, easy.
[11:15.77]Oh, it's just the four of us.
[11:17.41]Okay, is this a siege or is this just four drunk buddies on a boat going fishing?
[11:23.93]Yeah, we're all just getting drunk.
[11:26.97]Fuck King George.
[11:28.03]Fuck you.
[11:28.77]Fuck your face.
[11:31.29]Mutiny.
[11:32.51]There's only four of us.
[11:37.54]How do I get rid of the fucking stupid water on your face?
[11:43.21]Oh my god, that's so awful!
[11:45.15]There's nothing worse than what we're just witnessing right there, I'm serious.
[11:54.17]Now turn us the other way, we have to go get us off the boat!
[12:05.06]We're the only people that own this game.
[12:08.18]I need to get away from the water.
[12:19.78]I love that so much!
[12:22.12]Fuck King George!
[12:25.52]That's not what they're saying, but it doesn't matter.
[12:27.32]It's still funny.
[12:28.38]Oh no!
[12:33.34]No, we- UGH!
[12:34.42]I can't even aim!
[12:35.18]Alright, I'm fucking swimming!
[12:41.77]Get us over there!
[12:42.53]Is everybody even on the other team?
[12:43.95]I'm swimming.
[12:46.61]Oh, that was a bad idea!
[12:50.25]Don't look at the screen.
[12:51.11]Don't look at the screen.
[12:55.87]How do I turn this off?
[13:02.51]Let's see.
[13:03.12]Water quality, right?
[13:04.94]There's got to be like a water quality.
[13:14.18]Help.
[13:15.30]There's no water here.
[13:17.26]Oh, give me a break.
[13:21.67]Texture quality, skybox quality, LOD quality.
[13:28.00]Let's restart the game.
[13:29.96]Yeah, I'll try that.
[13:32.00]That don't seem right.
[13:35.14]Fucking George!
[13:38.98]I wasn't doing that when I tried it before.
[13:41.84]Get into borderless window, maybe?
[13:43.68]I'll try it.
[13:48.21]Disable dirt.
[13:51.60]Now, let me actually see if that'll help video get out of full screen, maybe.
[13:55.87]And then maximize it.
[13:58.81]Let's see if that helps a little bit.
[14:05.59]Okay, where is it?
[14:06.61]It's coastal sea.
[14:07.33]There's only six people in here.
[14:11.33]Well, I'm going back in there.
[14:20.16]Let's see if that helps.
[14:30.95]Apparently it's an issue with naval battles according to Etalyx Can't do a naval but you have to do a land battle Alright, let's go on this side again Troops let's try this again.
[14:50.71]I'm gonna just command a boat and just get over there Now you can we can actually look now and see if it looks any better I
[15:03.02]Uh, we're okay here.
[15:04.66]Alright.
[15:05.94]Do I have a gun?
[15:09.64]How do I drive this?
[15:16.25]No, not sit.
[15:19.99]Alright, I'm gonna drive this.
[15:33.18]Okay, well that's fucking obnoxious.
[15:36.39]What's the- you can't do any naval battles?
[15:41.39]What is this dog shit?
[15:44.75]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[15:48.13]Borderless window, I- I'm- I'm in- I'm not in full screen right now.
[15:59.14]What are these resolutions, by the way?
[16:02.25]What the fuck are these resolutions?
[16:07.77]This is like 19 by 1920 by 10.
[16:09.35]Oh, 10?
[16:09.59]No, what?
[16:09.97]1017.
[16:09.99]Alright, we're gonna go to a different map.
[16:31.59]Right off the bat, I ain't impressed at all, by the way.
[16:37.28]Alright, let's go to this one.
[16:41.24]So let me change the resolution one more time.
[16:49.27]The devs have been working on a fix since March 23rd.
[16:51.49]Okay.
[16:51.67]Okay.
[16:59.44]That's fairly... At least they updated us about it.
[17:04.98]Okay.
[17:06.05]Let's do a land battle then.
[17:14.65]There it is.
[17:15.43]Come back.
[17:20.25]Alright.
[17:21.07]Which one of these is not going to do that?
[17:23.13]God damn, that was... That made me feel terrible.
[17:25.83]Now I, like, want to... Let's just do army battlefield.
[17:28.23]This one here.
[17:28.91]Fight.
[17:29.37]Let's fight each other.
[17:37.16]Just play mountain blade instead.
[17:46.40]Doctor's appointment in an hour.
[17:47.72]Are we going to be Prussia or France?
[17:50.06]Let's be France.
[17:55.13]Alright, should I be the rooster?
[17:56.23]Alright, let's be this guy.
[18:02.83]I have a drum.
[18:05.61]How do I play the drum?
[18:09.79]Are we just the Pied Piper?
[18:11.58]Okay.
[18:16.15]Okay, how do I do that?
[18:17.65]How do I play the mission?
[18:18.89]How do I do this?
[18:19.72]I eat poo-poo for fun.
[18:21.08]Alright, good.
[18:24.46]How do you do that?
[18:27.57]Why are we just toys?
[18:28.99]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[18:30.67]I need to know how to do this.
[18:38.19]Cameras, C is, okay.
[18:40.73]Free roam, melee weapons, firearm, reload, artillery, equip, lantern, interact is E. Musicians, musical instrument is Q. And then left click and right click.
[18:53.75]Alright.
[18:58.87]Alright, let's go.
[19:06.49]We can just- That's a long drum roll.
[19:10.57]Wait, are these enemies?
[19:19.86]What else can I do?
[19:21.30]Besides a drum roll?
[19:22.82]How about this one?
[19:27.88]By the way, let's talk about old warfare for a second here.
[19:30.90]What a useless fucking position.
[19:34.33]We're facing the enemy.
[19:35.19]We need to make sure we can try to kill them.
[19:37.29]Hey, I have an idea.
[19:39.03]Let's have half of the force have flutes and drums and shit.
[19:43.69]That sounds like a good idea.
[19:45.78]Well, wait, only like nine of us have guns and seven of us have drums.
[19:50.62]But they need to make sure they hear our music.
[19:52.56]They have to hear our music.
[19:57.42]It was used for communication.
[19:58.90]Just scream at each other.
[20:01.65]Where's my gun?
[20:02.63]Alright, I'll fuck this.
[20:03.63]Give me my weapon.
[20:04.35]Do I have a weapon?
[20:08.01]Yeah, I do.
[20:08.97]Here we go.
[20:10.21]How's this for a drum solo?
[20:14.51]Oh, did these guys say fuck France too?
[20:32.05]No, they say Viva.
[20:32.93]That means... Hooray!
[20:43.24]The guy with the flag, too?
[20:44.36]Yeah, I understand.
[20:46.51]Okay, the guy with the flag, I understand his purpose, right?
[20:48.59]The guy with the flag.
[20:50.39]It's very important that he was around.
[20:52.05]Because he needed to prove that you were friends.
[20:54.31]But couldn't you just go by uniforms?
[21:03.47]The old warfare.
[21:06.13]Wave the flag around.
[21:08.53]Play some musical tunes.
[21:13.52]And by the way, none of us have any real, any formal training.
[21:18.74]I need to watch this guy for a few minutes.
[21:25.72]Oh, he's getting assists.
[21:28.44]You're doing a great job assisting.
[21:36.10]No, wait, whoa, whoa, that's my turn!
[21:43.65]Come on!
[21:44.03]Okay, this game's fun.
[21:51.00]Why is, I wish we could do the other battles, man.
[21:53.10]This is so, this is so dumb.
[21:55.14]I love it.
[21:57.16]I want to shoot another guy with this.
[22:05.82]How many people can be in this game?
[22:07.08]Alright, down here.
[22:10.38]I thought the guy was shooting a bow and arrow.
[22:15.96]Alright, I need people to come with me here.
[22:20.11]No, this guy's dead.
[22:20.93]No, he's on our team.
[22:23.15]Where do they even spawn?
[22:25.71]Oh, there they are.
[22:27.03]No, that's one of our guys.
[22:27.83]Come on, to safety.
[22:30.79]Make it.
[22:31.59]You gotta get over here.
[22:32.33]Make sure you don't get into any trouble.
[22:38.50]Oop, well that missed.
[22:43.11]There's one guy here.
[22:44.11]Chase him!
[22:44.43]No, there's another- there's a flute player right here.
[22:55.95]Why wouldn't you at least stand back?
[23:00.41]You know, it reminds me of... It's almost like back in the day when you thought that music was a magical spell.
[23:07.05]What the fuck are you doing?
[23:08.35]Oh, shit.
[23:14.05]That guy probably thought he was casting a curse on me.
[23:18.95]I'm going to switch classes away from the drummer guy.
[23:22.86]How do I do that?
[23:29.57]Tab?
[23:32.87]No, I don't want to be flute guy either.
[23:37.22]Fine, I'll play the fucking drums again.
[23:41.50]Just do drumroll, that's what you have to do.
[23:43.30]Only do drumroll.
[23:45.46]We need to be bees.
[23:53.53]We're dressed as bees too.
[24:01.23]We got any more bees?
[24:02.13]Yep.
[24:02.77]Couple bees behind us.
[24:11.69]We can't run.
[24:13.53]Come on, a snare drum doesn't weigh that much.
[24:19.06]Here comes a swarm of bees.
[24:20.56]How you gonna handle that?
[24:22.82]Oh.
[24:23.96]There's the rival colony.
[24:30.15]Yes, by the way, I'm shamefully standing behind this guy.
[24:33.88]Because if somebody tries to shoot me in the head, it's gonna hit this guy in the head.
[24:36.66]Like, that's just... I'm just trying to protect myself.
[24:42.90]Gotta keep the bees alive.
[24:49.34]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[24:54.42]No, watch out, watch out.
[25:00.46]Okay, is there a thing where they get annoyed to a point where they die?
[25:02.87]Can we play the drums near the... Alright, change class.
[25:11.55]No, spawn.
[25:13.24]Spawn as surgeon.
[25:15.48]Carpenter.
[25:19.10]Why are there random just workers here?
[25:24.40]Flag bearer.
[25:25.13]Alright, let's be surgeon.
[25:32.35]What do I have here?
[25:34.07]If I could... No, all I do, I just have, like, the Captain Crunch hat on.
[25:40.26]Alright, well, let's go.
[25:44.30]Let's find, like, somebody I can heal.
[25:45.48]No, I keep thinking this guy is on a different team.
[25:58.40]Heal?
[25:58.64]I don't know if there's nobody to heal.
[26:01.86]Watch out, this guy right here.
[26:08.49]Got him.
[26:08.89]Alright, now take his organs.
[26:10.55]We're gonna need those, right?
[26:11.75]Isn't that how it works?
[26:21.38]Viva la France.
[26:23.92]Easy.
[26:24.24]Wait, there's a guy.
[26:26.06]Where's this other guy?
[26:28.35]I need communication here.
[26:30.29]I need to know who's on our team.
[26:31.39]Play the drums correctly.
[26:32.65]Play our favorite song, not their favorite song.
[26:35.39]So if it was for communication, how... If I was on the enemy team, and I was playing this song for France, couldn't we just pretend to be other people?
[26:47.54]That's the easiest way you could ever... Just play their song.
[26:55.16]Hold on.
[26:57.21]I want to actually play a rifleman or something.
[26:59.31]This is the flute guy.
[27:02.03]Alright, rifleman.
[27:09.51]Carpenter.
[27:10.17]No, I'm not going to play the carpenter.
[27:11.87]There we go.
[27:15.65]This is what I want.
[27:17.47]I want to play the actual rifleman.
[27:19.67]See if I can get a few kills here.
[27:21.73]Any sidearms or anything?
[27:23.37]Yeah, he's got this one.
[27:29.79]Can I actually build a trebuchet?
[27:40.52]That guy's doing standing sit-ups.
[27:43.80]What kind of CrossFit shit is this guy doing right now?
[27:48.03]Working out his core, okay.
[27:58.48]Either that or he's flexing his pecs.
[28:00.72]I'm not sure what he's doing there.
[28:03.32]Alright, here we go.
[28:05.18]Let's get some shots here.
[28:08.00]Is there a crouch?
[28:08.62]Yeah.
[28:16.71]Oh, fuck.
[28:20.39]Hide behind the tree.
[28:24.15]Is it a party buff?
[28:25.41]How does this work?
[28:29.11]Got him.
[28:29.39]Nice work.
[28:35.74]Just keep your head down, man.
[28:38.42]It's a morale booster.
[28:40.16]For me, or for the character in the game?
[28:41.98]This isn't playing House Flipper?
[28:50.31]Well, that's not accurate.
[28:54.09]Neither is this gun.
[28:55.61]Oh, fuck.
[28:56.25]Here they come.
[29:01.48]Don't let him get in here.
[29:10.40]War.
[29:13.50]Welcome to war.
[29:17.90]They're all up there.
[29:18.56]I think, are we gonna win?
[29:20.30]There's one guy up there.
[29:24.42]I think I have a bayonet on this too, don't I?
[29:31.43]Right in the head.
[29:39.73]Don't get picked off.
[29:41.67]Right over here.
[29:42.05]Right to the left.
[29:42.54]Got him.
[29:43.88]Got him.
[29:44.86]Nice.
[29:45.22]You got him.
[29:46.92]I was still reloading.
[29:49.74]Oh, fuck.
[29:50.42]Where?
[29:56.02]Shit.
[29:57.86]Should I be the carpenter?
[29:59.09]Let's see.
[29:59.31]I'm going to be carpenter.
[30:00.65]How do I build?
[30:03.92]Carpenter's a shotgun.
[30:06.54]Where's the build stuff button?
[30:12.72]Do I have a build menu?
[30:20.59]Where are we dropping?
[30:25.55]So I gotta chop down a tree?
[30:27.31]That's not how it works, is it?
[30:28.39]I have a sword.
[30:40.10]That's not how this works.
[30:43.20]That's not how this game works.
[30:44.38]That's not how it's gonna work.
[30:51.20]Fucking music.
[30:57.72]Say something in the chat?
[31:00.22]No, I turned off chat.
[31:01.22]I learned my lesson last time there was a hundred people in a server.
[31:08.15]I'm trying to be wicked erratic.
[31:12.68]It's so hard to any moving target.
[31:18.12]I'm going right up into this guy's face.
[31:20.44]Three, two, one.
[31:22.24]I got a drum roll.
[31:23.93]I killed the guy behind him.
[31:32.19]It had nothing to do with our conflict.
[31:39.03]We're running out of men!
[31:40.17]Send in the librarians!
[31:51.32]you god damn it I think I want a different map I don't like this map I really want to get on a boat though that was the whole purpose get like a hundred people on a boat hold on what else is there
[32:25.22]Okay, open waters naval battlefield.
[32:27.33]What if we just all get on a boat and somebody drives it?
[32:31.53]What if I don't even look at the water?
[32:37.53]Do a fort map.
[32:41.81]Army battlefield, army battlefield, naval battlefield, coastal siege.
[32:47.93]Assault.
[32:58.08]South Sea Castle.
[32:59.78]That seems... No.
[33:01.78]Is that a boat?
[33:02.76]That's like... I have to play Fortnite now.
[33:11.41]Minecraft had an update.
[33:13.17]I don't play Minecraft.
[33:14.77]35, this one.
[33:18.77]100 flutes.
[33:29.48]Oh, cha-ching!
[33:33.48]I don't have it installed.
[33:34.64]Naval Battlefield, after all.
[33:37.58]No, I just can't do it.
[33:38.78]We're gonna have to do something else for a little while.
[33:43.97]I really thought we could get a couple hours out of this, but I feel like I can't play half the maps.
[33:50.45]Enable mics.
[33:56.67]I'm not gonna enable mics.
[34:01.38]to end the stream.
[34:03.34]I have a doctor's appointment that I have to go to in like three hours.
[34:09.77]No.
[34:13.91]Why can't I play Naval Battlefield?
[34:15.21]Because if you look at the water in this game, your screen shakes violently.
[34:21.18]And apparently it's been a known bug for like four and a half months.
[34:27.23]Play Mountain Blade.
[34:28.13]I don't have it installed.
[34:30.77]That's going to take a little while.
[34:31.63]We'll have to do that another day.
[34:32.55]That's only for the robot.
[34:39.14]Let me try one more time in a place that we haven't been before.
[34:43.24]This is a naval battle.
[34:44.06]This is open waters.
[34:45.04]Did we go here yet?
[34:46.86]I don't think so.
[34:47.42]We went to NA6.
[34:50.99]We went here.
[34:52.39]We didn't do this one.
[35:00.18]Let me try this one more time.
[35:05.70]No, I'm not going to play Dark Souls.
[35:12.45]Brush my teeth.
[35:14.17]For two hours.
[35:16.95]Let's try this one more time.
[35:23.86]So there are actual ships here.
[35:26.98]I'll be sailor.
[35:27.76]I want to see if it's possible to do this.
[35:31.32]Because it works for a minute, and then all of a sudden it just... Alright, this one works.
[35:46.93]I missed.
[35:47.51]Alright, load the ammo.
[35:48.99]Somebody help me.
[35:52.61]Do I have to hold?
[35:54.87]Where is it?
[35:56.87]That's not my job.
[35:58.01]That's somebody else's job.
[35:58.95]I'm the guy that aims the cannon and shoots it.
[36:00.49]It's somebody else's job to load it.
[36:02.29]Tell me when you're ready.
[36:05.09]I'm the designated cannon shooter.
[36:06.57]Is this violins?
[36:13.57]That guy's playing a violin.
[36:16.53]Why do we have... Oh no, he's holding a lantern.
[36:25.96]Alright, am I ready?
[36:27.54]I'll shoot it now.
[36:31.66]That designated loader has to load it.
[36:35.86]Alright, can we get the old prospector out of the way?
[36:41.67]What about this one?
[36:42.09]Is this one ready to be shot?
[36:44.53]Push it in.
[36:45.01]Here's the ammo.
[36:47.47]A round shot.
[36:49.23]I'll load it.
[36:49.97]Fine.
[36:50.39]It's not my job, but I'll do it.
[36:55.37]Alright, aim cannon.
[36:56.75]Hey, hey!
[36:59.31]Hey, that's not even your job!
[37:02.39]You're supposed to be doing that.
[37:03.47]Here comes a boat.
[37:06.86]Can I throw the ball at him?
[37:12.82]Alright, put this down.
[37:13.88]Oh, this is a bad... No, this is one of our boats.
[37:20.35]They're just scraping... No, it's not.
[37:27.65]Oh, yeah?
[37:29.03]It's like Luke Skywalker!
[37:31.95]Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[37:34.63]Watch this.
[37:37.82]Okay, what?
[37:38.62]Why did that happen?
[37:42.56]Oh, wow, that guy got killed.
[37:44.10]Okay, this is cool.
[37:45.22]I like this.
[37:53.52]Almost.
[37:55.89]Okay, I just saw that it landed.
[37:56.93]Can I steer?
[37:58.42]I'm not a captain, but can I steer this?
[38:01.00]Alright, aim cannon.
[38:11.54]That just came from behind us.
[38:12.80]Alright, there's a guy right here.
[38:20.18]Dude, I want to get hit right in the face.
[38:22.75]I want to get cannonballed directly in my mouth.
[38:26.32]And just go with the cannonball across the whole ocean.
[38:31.54]Jesus Christ.
[38:41.05]Now this is a game.
[38:42.79]No, I want to catch the cannonball with my mom.
[38:45.41]Please.
[38:48.57]No, no, no, no, no.
[38:49.23]Don't fall off.
[38:58.40]I feel like I could dodge that.
[39:00.54]If this was me in real life, I could probably dodge these.
[39:03.12]You dive out of the way.
[39:05.44]That's as fast as a baseball does.
[39:10.73]If a pitcher would have thrown a baseball at you.
[39:15.89]The British are victorious.
[39:21.21]Let's try it again.
[39:24.29]This is so loud too.
[39:26.65]Let me try to fix that.
[39:34.74]How come nobody's screaming in this one?
[39:40.21]Let's do brick.
[39:43.77]I'm going to do a schooner.
[39:46.51]I want to command it.
[39:47.59]Alright, I'm the commander.
[39:55.14]That's a weird instrument.
[39:56.04]No.
[39:57.38]There's the guy with the fiddle.
[40:00.22]How do you play the fiddle?
[40:00.94]Alright, let's go.
[40:04.07]Set sail.
[40:05.95]You guys ready?
[40:06.41]Let's move.
[40:08.77]I'm not entirely sure where we need to go.
[40:10.15]There we go.
[40:16.22]Naval battlefield.
[40:17.10]He's going to find the French ships.
[40:22.80]There they are.
[40:23.32]Okay.
[40:23.98]Full steam ahead.
[40:24.76]You're not going to hit him from that far away.
[40:29.72]Now you're going to reload that.
[40:35.96]Oh, I can actually do this in first person.
[40:40.24]Okay, I don't know.
[40:41.04]I guess my free will is gone.
[40:42.38]I'm being forced to do this.
[40:48.08]Now the thing I realize is that you can't shoot somebody in this server.
[40:51.89]Friendly fire is disabled.
[40:57.65]Like, should I turn... Alright, let me... Hold on a second.
[40:59.39]Let's try this.
[41:02.97]Oh my god.
[41:05.26]Quick, quick.
[41:21.57]Can you hear me, mateys?
[41:25.67]Mateys!
[41:27.97]As you can see ahead of us, we have the French ships alright over there.
[41:33.39]So do us a favor.
[41:34.65]Load up the cannons.
[41:36.80]Swab the deck if you got them up.
[41:41.18]But don't shoot until I tell you.
[41:42.68]Don't shoot until I tell you to.
[41:51.93]And play it with the heart's content.
[41:54.01]And play it faster than that.
[41:55.83]Much faster.
[41:57.33]At least two to three times faster.
[41:59.37]You fucking idiot.
[42:02.53]Arm the cannons.
[42:05.19]Gentlemen, it has been a pleasure aboard this boat with you.
[42:09.19]Aim and fire those cannons.
[42:12.03]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[42:13.73]Got him.
[42:14.59]Good work.
[42:15.85]Enemy on deck.
[42:16.69]Get up.
[42:16.87]Shoot the tank, brother.
[42:17.39]It loaded.
[42:22.89]Stab them with all your stabbing skills.
[42:28.59]Aim.
[42:31.71]And fire!
[42:32.33]I missed!
[42:37.14]Why is push to talk, by the way?
[42:39.72]This is not easy to do.
[42:43.20]Push to aim the cannon and shoot him!
[42:45.38]Right now!
[42:48.42]Oh no, the captain has to do it himself, apparently.
[42:50.74]Oh, I almost Luke Skywalker'd him.
[43:00.16]Why would he know that reference?
[43:05.31]Load it up for me.
[43:07.03]Please.
[43:11.69]A successful naval battle.
[43:13.71]And you shouldn't have done that.
[43:14.91]You'd have killed the captain, shoot the cannon.
[43:19.37]And can we board these people, please, and end their miserable existence?
[43:30.12]By the way, where is the chef?
[43:33.82]You.
[43:34.88]You are the new chef.
[43:37.66]Yes, tenderize that meat.
[43:39.22]Tenderize the meat.
[43:40.70]Because when you eat me eventually, you will eat me first.
[43:43.55]I'm the captain and I decide that.
[43:45.91]We go down with that shit, tenderize these bones.
[43:53.29]You would have to be crazy to deal with a bunch of fucking wankers like you.
[44:01.94]But I think that's why I love you all so much.
[44:09.87]On starboard side.
[44:14.53]Starboard has at least one of our allies.
[44:17.69]We need to send in reinforcements.
[44:19.60]Attack full force with the cannons.
[44:21.30]They are now at port side.
[44:26.30]Watch the bow, please.
[44:28.96]Watch the bow, please.
[44:34.67]Yeah, I went to the academy with him.
[44:36.11]He's a real fucking moron.
[44:37.67]Board the ship.
[44:44.14]I didn't have my gun re... No, no, no!
[44:45.68]I'm just going to have open mic turned on.
[44:55.68]No, don't hold this.
[44:58.16]One guy.
[45:00.04]Alright, I'm going to board.
[45:07.67]Now, I know that this is our ally over here, but we should board this boat and take it.
[45:15.52]There's only one guy on this ship, and how the fuck are they ever going to tell the Queen about us?
[45:20.39]How will the Queen ever know?
[45:24.91]The few may sacrifice to feed the many, as you see.
[45:29.45]Watch and learn.
[45:34.61]You Captain fell overboard!
[45:35.77]Wait, you Captain fell overboard!
[45:36.89]Please!
[45:37.47]You Captain, please!
[45:41.32]I'm not scared.
[45:42.20]I don't want to die out here with these French guys.
[45:44.38]No, please.
[45:49.58]As you were.
[45:51.42]Steer towards Port Starboard.
[45:55.12]Hello.
[45:55.48]Ah, that was a warning shot just to prove that I am safe and ready to talk diplomatically.
[46:07.27]It's a fight he wants.
[46:12.03]Hey, I'm back boys and girls Watch out on the side here.
[46:21.52]We have at least two or three enemies.
[46:26.18]Oh I want to be on that boat.
[46:27.58]That boat seems like a lot more fun.
[46:29.94]Go over there.
[46:30.46]We're gonna go party boat I have commandeered a new vessel
[46:45.69]Ahoy!
[46:50.15]Catch any big ones?
[46:54.35]Oh.
[46:55.45]Hold.
[46:58.49]Why are we all taking separate boats?
[47:03.54]There, I turned on the boat.
[47:04.56]Now we can use electricity existed now.
[47:06.98]Back here.
[47:11.59]So, war.
[47:13.19]It's French, huh?
[47:14.55]Unbelievable.
[47:16.17]I really wish we could end this diplomatically.
[47:22.67]Nothing.
[47:23.00]We haven't eaten in four days.
[47:31.36]No, it's not.
[47:31.90]That's why I said we needed to start to eat somebody.
[47:38.10]Well, we don't want the skirt.
[47:39.10]And we have a man over here that's looking for us.
[47:41.72]Please pull over.
[47:47.14]Good day.
[47:49.10]Sit down, please.
[47:50.30]The war is over.
[47:51.12]We've already lost.
[47:54.95]Turn up their volume.
[47:55.89]Alright, here.
[48:04.90]Yes, it's a terrible thing.
[48:06.16]As long as we don't get captured, we should be perfectly fine.
[48:12.06]It's obvious he's using the webcam, Mike.
[48:15.28]Hold on a second.
[48:17.95]Has it really been on this shit?
[48:19.25]Oh, God.
[48:20.03]Fuck.
[48:24.63]Sorry, I had a thing in my throat for the last two or three hours.
[48:30.58]That's what happens when you're on the boat for too long.
[48:32.30]You pick up a strange...
[48:34.63]Illness of the throat.
[48:40.57]So what are you guys going to do when you finally get back home to France?
[48:48.43]I got a beautiful wife and kids at home, brother.
[48:52.99]As do I, as do I.
[48:55.55]My woman Marie's been about ten years since I've seen her.
[48:59.47]That's a long time.
[49:00.33]I know.
[49:00.63]War is terrible.
[49:02.47]Just dastardly war has gone on long enough, I would say.
[49:04.83]And finally done, it's over.
[49:05.83]And even if we get captured and they bring us back, at least we will know that we... I brought my son with me.
[49:13.36]Now he's gone.
[49:14.62]That's terrible.
[49:15.50]I remember the sound of his voice.
[49:19.46]Daddy, please may I come aboard the boat with you?
[49:23.70]I said, that's just a little bit too much for me, brother.
[49:27.30]I can't take my child aboard this here ship.
[49:30.74]Yes, it's too much.
[49:31.80]Please, Daddy, I want to come.
[49:33.72]I heard that cannon coming, brother.
[49:37.48]I saw his tears as that ball went through his skull.
[49:42.85]Family is always the most important, and I'm very sorry to hear about your loss.
[49:46.23]But we may have a problem over here.
[49:47.89]As you can see, we have a French vessel.
[49:50.41]I think it's time to surrender.
[49:53.71]It's been a pleasure not being your captain because half of you weren't on my boat.
[49:59.05]It's okay, sir.
[50:01.13]I'm going to sail right towards them French.
[50:04.11]Sail towards them.
[50:06.81]Hello.
[50:08.01]Good day.
[50:08.63]I know that we don't speak the same language, but I know at least half of you can speak the English language.
[50:16.46]Wait.
[50:17.22]What team are we on?
[50:21.08]This guy's like a southern accent Throw a lifeboat out for him.
[50:35.86]We are the lifeboat
[50:46.86]We're already on one of those.
[50:48.85]Well, you don't know.
[50:49.55]At least we have a new one.
[50:51.67]How do I move?
[50:53.23]Alright, I got enough for you.
[50:57.27]Alright, I'm out of here.
[50:58.59]No, no, no.
[50:58.91]What about me?
[50:59.77]I'm still here, over the side.
[51:01.23]There's always enough.
[51:05.14]Just like glazed potato chips.
[51:07.38]Once you have one, you have to eat the whole bag.
[51:09.68]Wait a minute.
[51:11.22]You ain't England.
[51:11.74]You're in a different uniform.
[51:13.04]What the...
[51:14.52]Yeah, I'm from the new unit.
[51:15.70]I'm, uh, yeah.
[51:17.28]Yeah, from the... Oh, shit.
[51:18.96]What did you do?
[51:21.04]It wasn't me, brother.
[51:22.42]We're fucking going.
[51:28.09]Yeah, I love how we're just playing the lazy river at the water park.
[51:31.47]Isn't that fantastic?
[51:33.03]Three of us.
[51:33.85]Well, I mean, maybe we'll eat him.
[51:37.00]Hey, do you remember Splash Mountain, brother?
[51:39.64]I do.
[51:45.09]It's alright, he'll be fine as long as he has the dog to let them give him the body for the food It looks like he could use it more than that By the way, this is Hulk Hogan on the both of us.
[51:57.82]We're supposed to be British Do with a drunken sailor what do you do with a drunken sailor feed him to the lions
[52:12.78]Why don't we go around the table and do ghost stories?
[52:14.94]I'll start with one of my favorites.
[52:16.84]Once upon a time, there was a little boy in a graveyard.
[52:21.28]He thought he smelled a ghost.
[52:23.86]It ended up being a lemon pickle pie.
[52:26.82]Which, by the way, I miss those dearly.
[52:29.42]When was the last time you had a lemon pickle pie?
[52:31.73]Boy, it's been a century, it seems.
[52:37.25]I don't know how many there is, I'm going to be honest with you.
[52:57.06]That guy may as well have been walking his dog.
[53:03.64]Seriously.
[53:06.24]Anyways.
[53:07.60]Turns out... Fucking goddamn.
[53:10.62]I can't get over that.
[53:14.56]These boats are empty.
[53:15.84]These are always a graveyard.
[53:18.82]Oh.
[53:20.68]Oh.
[53:26.43]Who's even driving this boat?
[53:28.19]Why are there so many of us?
[53:29.43]We are a pack of seagulls.
[53:33.08]Hail them.
[53:33.84]Hail them.
[53:34.38]Hail them.
[53:34.92]Hail them.
[53:39.72]Excuse me.
[53:40.72]You are talking to Captain J.R.
[53:42.14]Spinkleworth of the SS Underneath.
[53:47.77]Reddit didn't exist yet.
[53:49.57]Kill him.
[53:59.61]Well, we're dead.
[54:07.05]Okay.
[54:17.10]Should I still be a cow?
[54:18.08]I feel like I shouldn't be.
[54:18.68]I want to do a new character.
[54:19.76]Yeah, I'm doing a new character.
[54:21.78]We're going to be a carpenter.
[54:23.94]We're going to be a carpenter.
[54:25.84]Carpenter.
[54:27.00]Carpenter.
[54:27.94]Carpenter.
[54:30.78]Well, I think I'm going to be a cop.
[54:34.04]Sailor.
[54:34.54]No, there's only going to be one.
[54:36.30]Violinist.
[54:36.86]Here we are.
[54:47.29]Does anyone have a favorite song?
[54:53.84]Oh, I'm not sure I'm aware of that one.
[54:56.26]Let me see if it's in my library.
[55:09.61]Is this what you required?
[55:10.55]I feel like I just threw a spear up.
[55:28.43]Okay.
[55:31.01]I mean, I need money if I'm going to continue playing.
[55:38.23]There he goes.
[55:45.25]Like, phew.
[55:46.73]No, I don't want to pick up anything.
[55:50.41]I want to go back in a lifeboat.
[55:52.81]I can't... Why can I not move?
[55:54.54]I'm stuck here.
[55:57.56]Can somebody push me?
[55:58.42]There we go.
[56:01.06]Thank you.
[56:08.02]Is that a boat following us?
[56:09.20]Are they friendly?
[56:09.88]I can't tell.
[56:13.20]Let's see how they react to this song.
[56:22.37]What is the... Where are we even going?
[56:24.73]Here we are.
[56:33.22]Traitorous thieves on that boat over there.
[56:35.04]Traitorous thieves.
[56:40.71]Can anyone tell me... What is the history of our nation?
[56:43.89]Anyone know?
[56:46.49]Why are we fighting?
[56:47.27]Good show.
[56:54.79]That's not how the nation started.
[56:57.52]Big bits, oh shit.
[57:02.90]I'm going in a rowboat, fuck this.
[57:04.26]I'm gonna go play songs for the enemy.
[57:05.68]Where'd it go?
[57:12.73]Where'd that boat go?
[57:14.91]Oh shit, it's over there.
[57:16.25]We're going too fast.
[57:20.15]Okay, we're good.
[57:24.58]Alright, let me get in this boat and we'll read the bits there.
[57:30.26]Alright, what have we got?
[57:31.44]We had, like, 50 bucks here.
[57:33.74]Thank you, the Imperial Mandate, for the $50.
[57:35.40]Thank you so much.
[57:39.29]Uh, hello there, Jerma.
[57:40.09]I'm but a humble member of what was known as the Order of Tomatoes.
[57:44.95]We were a peaceful order dedicated to taking long, brisk walks outside and planting tomatoes.
[57:52.73]until we were systematically destroyed by some kind of group dedicated to worshipping ice cream.
[57:59.58]I am one of a few of the survived members of a massacre.
[58:02.62]I caught wind that you might have heard of such a group and thought I might come to you for answers.
[58:10.68]Oh, this is talking about an ice cream cult thing.
[58:14.44]I have no idea what that is.
[58:16.32]I can't help you there.
[58:18.29]That's the joke.
[58:20.11]No, wait.
[58:22.49]Slow down.
[58:23.77]Thank you.
[58:28.65]But thank you so much, Imperial Mandate.
[58:33.85]What the fuck was that?
[58:39.75]Why can't I move?
[58:40.59]Am I gonna drown?
[58:46.10]There we go.
[58:48.48]Thank you.
[58:54.39]Take us to the enemy.
[58:56.25]I have one final act I will perform.
[58:59.13]Are there even any enemy players?
[59:07.27]There's so many more enemies than us and we're just like lost at sea.
[59:10.95]I'm rowing this boat.
[59:12.23]I'm getting us out of here.
[59:13.29]Oh, we already got one.
[59:16.65]We got a guy doing it.
[59:23.78]I can't play while sitting down?
[59:24.90]What?
[59:32.04]Take us that way.
[59:37.74]We did it!
[59:39.66]Viva la France!
[59:41.24]We did it!
[59:44.95]We're in English.
[59:46.15]God damn it.
[59:47.15]No, we're not.
[59:47.49]We're French.
[59:47.97]We win.
[59:50.59]Let's try this again.
[59:53.93]Now that we can actually be out there.
[59:59.61]I gotta play like a crabby deckhand.
[60:02.63]You know what I mean?
[60:04.99]Crabby British deckhand.
[60:08.45]On one of these little guys here.
[60:10.98]On these ones.
[60:12.02]That sounds good to me.
[60:13.76]Okay.
[60:17.24]Hey, how are you?
[60:19.62]I'll be sitting down over here in case you have any orders for me.
[60:22.98]I'll take them.
[60:27.55]That was another two-four.
[60:31.63]I've only got two or three left in me whole mouth.
[60:36.25]Gotta get these workouts.
[60:40.85]I won't be able to eat a piece of bread no more.
[60:42.66]This is what sailors do when they're bored.
[60:51.20]There's a place where I can sit down.
[60:52.74]Work that cord.
[60:53.58]Put down the thing.
[61:02.52]Gotta do everything myself, apparently.
[61:05.06]Whoever that is.
[61:06.06]There.
[61:09.87]Yeah, I'm not the only bloody bastard not in a uniform.
[61:12.41]Is that how this works?
[61:15.03]Too good for a uniform, apparently.
[61:18.93]It's alright.
[61:20.35]I've lived the mercenary life as long as I remember.
[61:26.81]I haven't taken a shower in over 14 days.
[61:30.21]In a fortnight.
[61:33.89]I'm not talking about that bloody game that everybody thinks is so much fun.
[61:38.36]That game fucking sucks.
[61:43.98]Don't waste ammunition like a fucking idiot, please.
[61:50.88]Are we captainless on this shithole here?
[61:59.09]Can you get us some action here?
[62:02.08]Feel like shittin' me pants would be more fun.
[62:20.87]I smell a moss on the rocks.
[62:28.11]If you have an issue with your visuals, with the water, you've got to leave this existential plane and read your... Fuck!
[62:35.44]Are we taking on people here?
[62:37.62]The weight limit.
[62:38.96]Mates, mates, mates.
[62:41.27]There's a weight limit on here.
[62:42.53]You can't have 200 people on a boat.
[62:44.47]What are you, fucking Dolanad?
[62:46.09]There's a weight limit on here.
[62:48.43]You don't have safety limits.
[62:52.13]You've got a blind man over there moving a boat around.
[62:57.31]Mate.
[62:58.23]Mate, you good?
[63:03.05]Bunch of fucking dumbass mates on this boat here.
[63:06.43]Mate, mate, mate, mate, mate.
[63:08.00]Alright, mate, mate, mate, mate, mate, mate.
[63:10.52]Hello?
[63:27.59]Are we here?
[63:31.21]Strange.
[63:33.67]Strange, strange, strange.
[63:45.19]Well, yeah, that was weird.
[63:47.93]That's not typical is how it usually happens.
[63:51.84]Usually, the stream goes down to 500k a second for 30 minutes until it decides it's not gonna turn on.
[64:00.60]Alright, I gotta get back in character, though.
[64:02.06]That was just trying to get fun, too.
[64:03.94]God damn it.
[64:10.63]Back in town.
[64:12.77]Alright, let's go.
[64:13.27]I'm gonna just join that same server.
[64:17.37]I was having fun.
[64:19.77]I really only do have another hour, though.
[64:23.85]Fuck me.
[64:31.22]Don't join that one.
[64:31.88]It has the bug.
[64:32.60]Okay, I'll join a different one.
[64:33.48]Alright, let's get that out there.
[64:38.76]Back to what we were doing.
[64:43.86]Thank you for your patience with this bullshit.
[64:51.67]Annoying stuff.
[64:52.97]Alright, let's go.
[64:56.29]So let's do... Naval Battlefield.
[65:00.43]We got this one here.
[65:03.10]This one has people in it.
[65:04.14]Let's see if this one has any seven.
[65:06.72]Is this the different one?
[65:07.56]Let's see if this one has a bug.
[65:14.58]Is that the one I was just on?
[65:15.64]It changed maps though, didn't it?
[65:17.72]No, it didn't.
[65:18.24]Okay.
[65:20.98]Bug.
[65:23.26]You need to put a quarter into the internet cafe booth.
[65:25.40]Seriously.
[65:27.28]The bug is client side.
[65:28.42]Let's see.
[65:37.69]Jesus Christ!
[65:40.75]Ah!
[65:45.02]Yeah, it's happening.
[65:49.88]Well, time to go.
[65:56.97]Alright.
[65:57.91]Naval battlefield.
[65:58.95]We've got that.
[65:59.33]That's the one we were just on.
[66:00.50]Naval battlefield.
[66:01.40]Open waters.
[66:02.22]How about this one?
[66:03.62]Nobody on it, though.
[66:07.04]Army battlefield.
[66:08.10]I guess we don't have to be in a boat, do we?
[66:13.64]EU.
[66:17.11]EU.
[66:17.53]EU.
[66:17.93]Naval battlefield.
[66:18.71]I mean, there's zero people in here.
[66:24.13]Let's see if we can get anybody in this.
[66:29.59]Perfect sub.
[66:36.28]Change the server to all?
[66:45.68]Yeah, but not... Hold on.
[66:46.34]Wait, wait, wait.
[66:46.94]Yeah, but if... When it's not on the official server, is it... The ping goes through the roof.
[66:56.89]I guess...
[66:58.51]Not these two.
[66:59.99]When I tried this last time, it was out of control.
[67:03.23]Alright, let's do Naval Battle.
[67:05.48]This is the one we were just on.
[67:08.54]That's the other one.
[67:09.38]Sorry for everybody that just joined that.
[67:14.65]Naval Battle.
[67:15.25]Open waters here.
[67:18.03]These are all empty.
[67:23.15]Yeah, all these are empty.
[67:25.68]It's just army deathmatch.
[67:26.90]There really only is a few.
[67:28.92]There are only a few servers that have anybody even in them.
[67:32.04]Nobody plays naval.
[67:32.90]Probably because of the bug, right?
[67:34.50]Everyone's like, no, I don't want to do that shit.
[67:37.24]There are three or four servers that are doing naval.
[67:40.51]Here they are.
[67:43.37]Damn it.
[67:45.33]But we might have to stay in this one.
[67:52.17]I mean, this one has 150 people in it.
[67:57.85]Might want to try.
[67:58.81]Let's just get into one with 150 people.
[68:00.48]Fuck it.
[68:00.78]Who cares?
[68:01.14]This one.
[68:07.98]Think I can roleplay in here?
[68:09.88]We'll find out.
[68:16.81]This is going to be just total chaos.
[68:24.77]How long until I get vote kicked?
[68:26.11]58 people versus 71.
[68:30.93]Camp West.
[68:35.14]Can I just be a guy?
[68:37.18]Rifleman, support, carpenter.
[68:40.40]Bagpipe?
[68:42.18]Oh, there's already three bagpipe guys.
[68:45.70]Grenader?
[68:47.75]Oh, Grenader!
[68:49.27]Grenadier?
[68:49.79]I can throw grenades?
[68:50.99]Grenades?
[68:56.33]Why does nobody want to be him?
[69:01.39]What's going on here?
[69:06.10]I can't join the round anymore?
[69:07.06]Alright, let's try Grenader over here.
[69:16.74]Holy Jesus.
[69:17.43]I can't be British guy over here.
[69:28.76]I gotta play along.
[69:30.09]I'm gonna play along and try.
[69:32.89]Seems like cannons are... I'm on an EU server.
[69:36.95]Oh, dumbass.
[69:43.11]Check the houses, mates.
[69:43.93]Check the houses.
[69:55.58]That's not French.
[69:56.24]It doesn't matter.
[70:00.79]Easy.
[70:01.20]Watch it.
[70:01.86]Don't go right in.
[70:05.50]Ignore it.

[71:22.21]Swaggle bag.
[71:28.95]I can't do a French accent.
[71:29.83]It'll be embarrassing if I even try.
[71:34.87]We have to head over here.
[71:36.59]I'm going to sound like Arnold if I try this.
[71:39.23]Remember, to do a French accent, just do Arnold, but don't add any like... Come on, you big dogs.
[71:47.61]Let's go charge.
[71:49.80]I'm trying to charge, but you have to get out of the way.
[71:52.96]Watch this, they're shooting.
[71:54.08]They're shooting at the top.
[71:55.12]Shoot at the top.
[71:55.94]Don't shoot.

[72:24.38]Squeeze on.
[72:24.76]I think we have to... They're shooting a trebuchet at us.
[72:26.70]Squeeze on.
[72:52.54]What song is this?
[72:54.10]This song, this is wrong music.
[73:06.39]What the fuck are they?
[73:07.45]What is this song?
[73:09.57]That's not correct.
[73:10.75]Turn it off.
[73:11.89]Turn it off.
[73:14.23]Turn, somebody turn that off.
[73:17.90]Oh, that was, that was not that song.
[73:21.87]They were talking about people's dicks and stuff.

[74:30.46]Are we?
[74:37.29]Are we?
[74:44.33]I don't know how to respond to that.
[74:56.88]That guy just shot it directly into the air.
[74:59.16]That's gonna come straight down and hit him.
[75:01.60]Is that gonna come straight down?
[75:03.54]This is gonna come straight down, isn't it?
[75:06.92]Holy shit!
[75:11.71]What gun am I?
[75:12.71]That's not a gun?
[75:13.33]Alright, I'm gonna play.
[75:22.96]Should've tried to catch it.
[75:30.38]Bugs Bunny cannon.
[75:32.88]Can we do that too?
[75:38.60]This is dangerous waters.
[75:40.66]Have an open mic with 150 people.
[75:42.78]You understand that, right guys?
[75:44.58]This is like dangerous waters right now.
[75:48.20]And I mean that literally and figuratively.
[75:53.70]What no man's sky planet am I on?
[76:03.56]Just team kill.
[76:04.41]Friendly fire is off.
[76:13.76]I love the little children's music that's playing because when they're together when there's four flutes at the same time It's just a little kids theme song.
[76:22.73]I would imagine here Thank you be sure I appreciate the
[76:43.00]It's a heads up!
[76:48.47]Ooh!
[76:52.41]Ooh!
[76:55.17]Got one!
[76:55.55]I got one!
[76:56.07]I got one, guys!
[76:56.63]I got one!
[77:06.14]Somebody's just singing over that!
[77:07.46]Somebody is actually singing over that!
[77:09.06]What is this person doing?
[77:20.98]I don't like this.
[77:21.86]I don't like this open mic stuff.
[77:26.28]This is walking on glass with spiked shoes.
[77:30.24]And you're walking, you're not, you're running over the glass.
[77:35.36]Sir, I don't think I'm ready for this fight.
[77:40.20]Not be a coward.
[77:51.54]I'm more nervous than anything else.
[77:53.28]I'm so nervous.
[77:56.04]I'm gonna have to mute this because I am actually kind of nervous about this.
[77:59.14]Oh, fuck this game!
[78:15.55]What else we got?
[78:17.01]Let's check out another menu here.
[78:23.10]We gotta do a naval battle again.
[78:24.32]Those are more fun.
[78:27.46]All it takes is one guy.
[78:28.32]That's right.
[78:30.12]Alright, we got... This one's EU, but I don't know if people are in there.
[78:35.62]I think this is still bugged.
[78:41.55]Should we try this one again?
[78:42.33]I think it's bugged still.
[78:46.21]You will follow.
[78:47.09]Zero people isn't quite enough.
[78:48.25]People will join.
[78:48.89]Yeah, but I don't think there's probably less than 20 people that are joining.
[78:52.03]We could try it.
[78:52.53]Let's just do it.
[78:55.37]Naval battle.
[78:56.47]This is the EU one.
[78:57.37]Same place, but whatever.
[78:58.57]Just whatever.
[78:59.29]It'll be more fun because then I don't have to worry about having to mute everybody's microphone potentially.
[79:07.61]The British are playing copyrighted music.
[79:12.54]I want to go back to who I was before.
[79:20.36]Alright, British.
[79:22.06]Here we are.
[79:23.44]I don't care what boat I'm on.
[79:24.42]I like the little ones, though.
[79:27.44]Here.
[79:31.40]Okay, I'm better.
[79:33.22]Holy fuck, that happened.
[79:37.11]Excuse me, sir.
[79:37.91]I don't think I've been given a gun.
[79:39.27]You gotta earn a gun.
[79:41.45]Yeah, just get one.
[79:45.33]Okay.
[79:46.27]I guess that sounds like a fair deal.
[79:49.53]It better be.
[79:52.29]Salad fingers.
[79:56.71]See who's in the direction.
[79:57.80]I'm the enemy.
[80:01.62]Or I'll beat you with a wooden stick.
[80:09.83]Good job, mate.
[80:19.38]There's only three people on the other team, by the way.
[80:25.09]This war not gonna last more than two minutes.
[80:27.23]Hello, mate.
[80:28.37]Hello, mate.
[80:28.97]How you doing over there, mate?
[80:32.71]This guy's fucking just like an email address.
[80:38.86]I don't want to hear any of that profanity on my boat, please.
[80:41.52]Oh, sorry.
[80:45.77]You gotta pull over.
[80:47.27]You're carrying smuggled goods.
[80:49.39]Pull over.
[80:49.81]That's alright.
[80:51.73]Smuggling goods wasn't allowed.
[80:52.97]Pull over.
[80:56.38]I'll make you pull over.
[80:59.40]It's the police apparently.
[81:02.32]Get him boys.
[81:03.34]All of you get on this boat right now.
[81:04.96]Get on the boat.
[81:06.84]That guy has an Iron Man suit on apparently.
[81:12.12]Oh, never mind.
[81:12.68]I thought it was on his shoulder.
[81:14.70]Never mind.
[81:15.22]I thought he was Iron Man.
[81:22.46]We are the British Empire, mate.
[81:23.67]I don't know who you think you're talking to.
[81:31.49]What about the weight limit?
[81:32.99]It's changed.
[81:37.79]Open the map and get us to a different place.
[81:39.27]That's the wrong voice.
[81:40.13]Open the map and get us to the wrong place.
[81:47.39]Where are we going?
[81:48.17]I don't know.
[81:49.13]We need to go this way.
[81:51.01]Over there!
[81:51.49]Right there.
[81:57.19]I'm just gonna hold my hand out and you'll be able to see.
[82:01.11]Fall on the arm.
[82:04.18]It's extended.
[82:05.98]That way.
[82:12.78]Go, go, go!
[82:13.72]Come on, go!
[82:20.21]I'm losing patience, go, come on.
[82:23.13]The role player like comes out of character and is really angry.
[82:30.84]I surrender.
[82:38.82]Do you RP?
[82:42.42]I'm gonna get real close to the mic and say this.
[82:48.14]No, I can't.
[82:48.69]Nevermind, that'll hurt ears.
[82:51.43]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on, we got, oh!
[82:54.04]I fell overboard, hold on, I fell, I fell, I fell.
[82:59.60]I was locked in, you guys, and your body's blocking me.
[83:04.21]I fell in.
[83:06.97]Oh, that one just gave me a new haircut.
[83:09.85]May as well be bald, right, mates?
[83:15.21]Who'da feel alive again?
[83:18.92]We're about to be boarded.
[83:19.50]We're about to be boarded.
[83:20.60]They're here.
[83:21.06]They're here.
[83:22.68]That's alright.
[83:23.36]There's one over there, sir.
[83:25.02]Oh, no.
[83:26.10]Hey, and when you're done with the... Never mind.
[83:28.30]That was relatively easy.
[83:29.98]Take their heads.
[83:30.90]Get off again.
[83:37.11]It's alright.
[83:38.59]Remember to take off your coats, Captain.
[83:41.31]Dry them out.
[83:41.99]Ear drum.
[83:45.91]They're in a sea of all kinds of Brits here.
[83:48.53]I don't think they know what they're doing.
[83:51.69]There we are.
[83:53.19]There, that fucking idiot.
[83:56.35]Aim that aim then over that way and shoot those tires out.
[84:04.83]There, that's what I'm saying.
[84:06.09]Hit that tire.
[84:06.97]That's banned on here.
[84:15.15]Hey, gentlemen, how's today sound?
[84:21.31]This is my boat now.
[84:25.16]You got one second to surrender, mate.
[84:27.20]Before you get boarded.
[84:30.62]Alright, he surrendered.
[84:31.60]He surrendered.
[84:32.06]Leave him alone, mate.
[84:33.46]Leave him alone.
[84:33.98]Don't take this one.
[84:35.29]Don't take this one of your off my damn crew.
[84:37.25]You understand that?
[84:41.87]I want both of you to stand over here.
[84:47.75]Are you going overboard?
[84:49.49]Hey, he's trying to get away.
[84:50.47]Good luck to him.
[84:51.43]Shoot him like a fish in a fucking barrel.
[84:54.85]You gonna try the same thing, mate?
[84:58.94]Good.
[85:00.48]Let's go ahead and get you over here.
[85:02.06]Into the brig where you belong, mate.
[85:07.92]We're gonna be as merciful as I determine.
[85:12.06]You got any goods on this boat?
[85:17.02]Yeah, you're gonna put that on my report card for my teacher to sign as well.
[85:27.03]We're not here to talk kindness.
[85:28.85]We're here to talk about what you got on this fucking boat, mate.
[85:33.45]He looks like he's gonna jump, sir.
[85:35.35]If he jumps, you know what to do.
[85:37.59]Rot in his arse.
[85:40.60]I don't like you putting your- getting your friend over here, too.
[85:43.84]I want you both standing in the same place, because you're both gonna walk the plank if you don't start talking.
[85:54.97]The tree has got one chance.
[85:58.83]We're gonna start with you in the middle.
[86:01.51]Name your favorite movie.
[86:03.62]And it better be time period.
[86:05.90]Come on, let me up.
[86:06.76]Please, come on.
[86:08.04]Frozen?
[86:08.97]Frozen's not in the right time period.
[86:10.45]Your favorite movie from the 1800s, mate.
[86:11.68]You bastard!
[86:16.52]Well, that didn't work out so well.
[86:29.25]I didn't imagine that was going to happen.
[86:30.67]It's alright.
[86:31.19]We're back in business.
[86:38.72]Royal officer over there.
[86:40.16]Is that what you said?
[86:41.77]Slow that boat down.
[86:42.91]We're boarding you.
[86:46.19]Keep him.
[86:48.65]Ah, fuck.
[86:49.31]I jumped off the boat too early.
[86:51.09]Turn around and get me.
[86:55.60]Hey, by the way.
[86:59.78]Jack Sparrow wouldn't even French.
[87:03.02]You got the wrong music.
[87:06.40]It turned up as fucking stereo, mate.
[87:08.32]Good job.
[87:09.94]Okay, you're under arrest, Mr. Frenchman.
[87:15.87]Oh, shit, he blocked it.
[87:16.85]I didn't imagine he could do that.
[87:18.27]Yeah, it's alright.
[87:18.93]He can block.
[87:20.17]Mate, mate, mate, mate, mate.
[87:21.29]Stop, he's just a puny Frenchman.
[87:22.65]Mate, mate, mate, mate, mate.
[87:32.54]Don't kill him!
[87:33.56]Let him live!
[87:34.84]I don't care if he kills that- Mate!
[87:36.52]I don't care if he kills every single one of you, so you ain't stayin' alive!
[87:40.22]Oh!
[87:44.37]You got one- You got one minute to apologize for that.
[87:48.87]Oh, that fucking music!
[87:54.04]This game is fucking ridiculous.
[88:02.05]Is that like a Windows error message?
[88:05.41]I think there's a lot more fun going on over here, if I'm honest.
[88:08.39]Okay.
[88:09.81]Yeah, do your fun.
[88:11.04]Excuse me, Mr. Frenchman with the brown hat.
[88:15.54]They took the boat.
[88:16.40]Listen to them.
[88:17.00]We have to listen to these... Fucking idiots!
[88:22.10]Please don't shoot me.
[88:25.85]Alright, I'm about to board.
[88:29.33]You took us all.
[88:30.29]You got us.
[88:33.18]Who did that shit?
[88:34.28]Oh, you idiots.
[88:36.30]Why would you let that happen?
[88:39.74]We can get aboard this one, sir.
[88:45.50]I didn't get it.
[88:46.08]Oh, shit.
[88:48.28]Goodbye, Captain.
[88:49.86]That wasn't even my ship, so it don't matter who capped that one.
[88:52.26]Probably ought to get it to Baltimore City.
[88:56.54]I totally understood what you were saying.
[88:59.68]It wasn't made up at all.
[89:00.98]Oh, is that a rock?
[89:10.81]You know, why can't we just be friends?
[89:12.69]The enemy doesn't have to be.
[89:17.23]Come on over here.
[89:18.69]There's plenty of room.
[89:24.08]What did you just fucking say to me?
[89:28.12]They're trying to shit... It's you two versus the world, apparently.
[89:36.29]Mike, you ever seen the movie Gremlins 2?
[89:42.12]I'm talking to you.
[89:42.78]Respond to me.
[89:43.34]You're supposed to be role-playing with me.
[89:44.82]Respond to me.
[89:45.76]Fuck.
[89:47.22]You ever seen... You missed it point blank, right?
[89:55.93]That is a fucking embarrassment.
[89:58.27]Did you see that?
[89:59.53]Everybody did.
[90:04.55]Holy fucking person And the French boat go go oh
[90:32.15]Hey guys, guys we're having computer problems over here.
[90:35.97]Something's going on with my mouse is not connecting properly.
[90:38.21]Do you guys know anything about that?
[90:39.25]Something's wrong with my graphics card.
[90:44.99]I need help with my graphics card.
[90:47.57]Who the fuck said that?
[90:50.24]Hey guys.
[91:03.09]I'm having a computer problem.
[91:05.21]My computer's fucked up.
[91:08.43]Guys, on this little boat over here, I need help.
[91:10.25]My computer's messed up.
[91:11.75]My graphics are fucking up.
[91:15.46]You know how to fix it?
[91:16.28]I need drivers or something.
[91:20.66]I don't know if my drivers are out of date or something.
[91:22.14]I have no idea.
[91:25.66]I just need some technical support problems.
[91:30.37]My PC is wicked messed up for some reason.
[91:32.11]I don't know why.
[91:40.55]So should I control alt delete or go to the NVIDIA website?
[91:44.21]What are you talking about, lad?
[91:46.81]This is 1812.
[91:47.67]We don't have any sort of computer.
[91:50.15]No, no, no, stop.
[91:51.13]We have to drop the act for a second, man.
[91:52.81]Like, my computer is like, I just need to know, should I go to amd.com?
[91:56.65]Should I right click?
[91:58.55]-2!
[91:59.63]I think you need to click control alt delete.
[92:04.89]No!
[92:14.83]And now I lost control of my mouse and this is what I was talking about I made it no I didn't what the fuck I'm coming with you
[92:44.63]Hey.
[92:45.01]Should we get on this boat over here?
[92:55.85]I think I might know.
[92:57.52]I didn't surrender yet.
[93:01.82]I need... I need... I looked over at Chad.
[93:09.94]That was not the right voice to use here.
[93:13.39]How did he not get hit by that?
[93:15.74]Yeah, just a couple of friends swimming around, that's what I say.
[93:22.18]You want to make it a race?
[93:25.34]How about, okay, on account of free?
[93:26.54]You want a race?
[93:29.60]That sounds like a little bit of fun for me.
[93:32.50]One, two, free.
[93:37.18]A little bit faster than you, mate.
[93:38.66]I'm a little bit closer to the boat than you are.
[93:46.08]We just have a trail of people here.
[93:48.39]Who is it?
[93:49.97]Somebody over in those woods.
[93:56.35]We're gonna board.
[93:59.13]Just stop shooting at us.
[94:00.39]There's no reason to.
[94:05.64]Don't stop shooting.
[94:06.90]You can't even hit us anyway, so let us just board for Christ's sake.
[94:12.64]We're not hostile.
[94:14.06]We just lost a boat for fuck's sake, mate.
[94:19.89]No, we'll sit over here.
[94:21.89]I want all the bricks.
[94:23.05]Ah, yeah, blew it.
[94:28.32]And now there comes the whole cavalry.
[94:31.00]I missed.
[94:33.66]I missed.
[94:46.85]I'm just going to start singing.
[94:58.68]Now I'm going to play an actual round.
[95:00.92]No, kill that guy.
[95:07.79]I'm going to play an actual round.
[95:08.93]I want to try to win.
[95:14.13]Let's be the Marines.
[95:16.78]Let's go on this one.
[95:17.70]Holy God, why is it so dark?
[95:22.45]Oh, this is not good.
[95:24.47]It's dark.
[95:25.93]How can you even see?
[95:26.87]Put the lamps on, boys.
[95:29.81]Get the lights on.
[95:32.91]I've got to turn the lanterns on.
[95:34.13]The lights on.
[95:36.15]Give me a break.
[95:37.13]They're around.
[95:37.83]They're around.
[95:38.83]Look for them.
[95:41.59]Hey, chaps.
[95:44.76]How do I turn the flashlight on?
[95:45.60]Is it F?
[95:46.42]That's what it is in every other game.
[95:47.46]I don't know.
[95:51.90]Maybe the devs should look into that.
[95:53.43]Like, there's no flashlight?
[95:54.41]That's fucking stupid.
[95:59.45]Nick Foles.
[96:00.73]Play Despacito.
[96:04.92]Do we have ammo in this?
[96:07.60]Alright, I'm gonna drive.
[96:09.34]Just stay on the boat.
[96:11.72]I'm gonna drive us.
[96:17.88]Just stay put.
[96:22.42]I'll get us out of here in a fucking second, dudes.
[96:27.34]Get on the boat.
[96:30.77]Come over here.
[96:31.23]Come on.
[96:31.45]There you go.
[96:33.97]Nice work, man.
[96:38.57]Okay, play something a little... I don't like that song.
[96:40.61]Play something else.
[96:41.65]That song is fucking stupid, man.
[96:48.17]I actually don't like having music on when I'm driving around because it just... It fucks up my head.
[96:51.85]I don't like it.
[96:56.45]Where are we?
[97:00.07]Quiet.
[97:05.40]Whiny driver.
[97:06.36]They'll be here.
[97:19.09]God, you guys don't even sound like a crew.
[97:20.57]What is with this?
[97:21.49]Where are the fun songs?
[97:23.11]Where are the drinking?
[97:29.04]This is sad music.
[97:30.24]We don't want sad music on here.
[97:31.62]Sing a song about how fun it is to drink with your mates.
[97:47.36]Yes.
[97:47.68]Yes.
[97:48.07]Get out of here.
[97:49.19]Get out of here.
[97:50.33]Get the fuck out of here.
[97:52.23]Get out of here.
[97:55.93]Get out of here.
[97:58.03]Yeah, go back to Brooklyn.
[97:59.77]Oh, this is like New York.
[98:03.76]Let's have a little chat.
[98:16.18]He comes over here again.
[98:18.04]Bop him.
[98:18.76]Bop him right in his fucking teeth if he comes over here again.
[98:20.88]Swear to God.
[98:21.56]Hey, I didn't mean to offend you, but the rest of the people that you hang out with are kind of mean.
[98:27.85]If you were as nice as me, Tony Meatballs, you'd have a good ass time.
[98:32.67]Tony,
[98:46.47]Watch where you're driving!
[98:47.84]Watch where you're driving!
[98:54.72]He went the wrong way.

[99:44.12]Yeah, I'll have a par-tay.
[99:45.26]Par-lay.
[99:46.26]We actually can't hit him.
[99:48.24]Get him!

[111:34.47]God damn it.
[111:38.99]Now we just have peace.
[111:40.17]And somebody was behind me, apparently.
[111:43.25]Wait, who am I muting?
[111:50.14]What happened?
[111:56.08]What happened?
[112:05.37]Okay, they've been muted.
[112:07.21]Thank you.
[112:09.29]Alright.
[112:10.45]We only have two minutes left in this whole thing, so.
[112:18.37]Sam Hyde.
[112:19.93]Who is this?
[112:21.69]I don't know.
[112:23.58]I was just told.
[112:24.24]Alright.
[112:29.18]Leslie, we have one minute here.
[112:30.66]Two minutes.
[112:33.58]I want a real match.
[112:34.52]You think that's not going to happen?
[112:36.58]It's impossible.
[112:39.24]The plan is take the next ship we see.
[112:42.76]Just take it.
[112:45.04]Just take it.
[112:46.74]Hey, I'm good at taking shit.
[112:50.78]Of course, we have Thunderstruck playing as well.
[112:55.97]Guys got sandwiched.
[112:56.93]Fucking violinist.
[112:58.55]My son, Timmy, plays the best violin.
[113:13.71]It's better this way.
[113:26.26]And that's how the French Revolution ended.
[113:30.20]I want to see the recital.
[113:45.63]I got one friend here.
[113:46.63]How can I still hear a violin?
[113:54.52]I would not be able to hear that from this far away.
[113:56.12]No way.
[114:04.98]That was the whole revolution, yeah.
[114:07.32]And they played dice on that boat for a couple hours.
[114:12.48]Hold on.
[114:13.02]No, that's a friendly vessel.
[114:15.18]Is it a friendly vessel?
[114:16.51]Stop the ship for a second, please.
[114:20.27]Stop the ship.
[114:20.75]We need to get out of there.
[114:21.55]Uh...
[114:41.11]Somebody shoot me.
[114:45.23]The war is over.
[114:47.65]We've lost.
[114:48.31]They gave me all the medicine I needed.
[114:57.94]What happened?
[114:59.04]Oh my god.
[115:00.78]France.
[115:01.46]France wins the war.
[115:15.77]Jesus Christ.
[115:17.59]That was all over the place.
[115:29.90]Go to the dentist?
[115:30.66]I don't have a dentist appointment.
[115:31.56]I have a doctor's appointment.
[115:33.76]Well, at least we got to come back and play again.
[115:38.11]Because I probably should just call it here.
[115:44.83]Sorry for the short two-hour stream, but I have a doctor's appointment in just under, like, 45 minutes.
[115:51.47]I have to be out there.
[115:54.69]That was... I was actually concerned about that.
[115:56.89]I thought that was going to end very, very badly.
[115:59.99]I thought that bug lasted through the whole game.
[116:01.97]I thought that... I'm glad that I was able to at least experience it.
[116:04.55]It was fun.
[116:09.57]I talked a little bit of shit in the beginning because I thought, oh, wait, hold on.
[116:12.28]I can't even play this game.
[116:13.42]No.
[116:15.77]Actually, that's probably one of the more fun naval combat boat games.
[116:20.47]I think that actually exists.
[116:22.49]Strangely enough.
[116:26.45]But, yeah, I'm doing doctor stuff.
[116:30.13]I will see you guys not tomorrow.
[116:32.25]I won't be here tomorrow.
[116:34.29]I have a lot of stuff going on over the weekend.
[116:37.15]So you will not see me again until Sunday, unfortunately.
[116:40.97]There's a lot of stuff with the house and I have a couple of family obligations to attend to over the weekend.
[116:48.05]So I will see you guys on Sunday.
[116:50.27]We will go over the emote contest and we will do a bunch of shit.
[116:56.86]There's actually Sunday might be a little might be a little longer.
[117:00.92]I mean last night was not last night.
[117:03.36]Two nights ago it was like an eight and a half hour stream.
[117:05.82]Try for another one.
[117:07.24]We might do that again on Sunday.
[117:09.67]Depends on how I feel.
[117:11.37]No, no Friday stream.
[117:12.31]I got a lot of obligations going on.
[117:14.20]I can't do anything for the next two, three days.
[117:16.94]But I will do the bits and, of course, the subs too.
[117:22.88]Thank you for coming for this little stream.
[117:26.34]Let's do the... Thankfully, the bits stayed, but the subs probably did not.
[117:32.69]Because the stream cut out halfway through, so... Let's see what happens here.
[117:39.88]Thank you to the people that are on this list and the people that are unfortunately not because of the stream and... Oh, God.
[117:48.72]Well.
[117:51.48]Hey, thank you.
[117:52.12]This is really slow.
[117:53.58]I'm not going to mess any of these up.
[117:55.92]Because there weren't very many because obviously it was like an hour.

[120:51.44]And you've always given me a good laugh during my darkest times.
[120:55.18]And they say Pride 100.
[120:58.20]Thank you, Chubby Kitten.
[120:59.23]Appreciate that.
[121:02.45]That's a long time.
[121:04.65]My YouTube channel started in 2011.
[121:08.65]So it's really interesting to know when a lot of people tell me they've been watching for more than five years.
[121:16.44]Thank you for sticking around as long as you have.
[121:20.04]Thank you, XTGBSBizik.
[121:23.77]Thank you for the $1.
[121:24.67]The Song of Storms.
[121:26.63]Thank you, dude.
[121:28.37]Brandon 201 Bakugan, thanks for the $1.
[121:30.54]Hey, Jerma, I'm going to donate $1 every stream until I reach $5,000 donated.
[121:35.18]Dollar one of 5,000.
[121:41.48]Well, let's do some math here.
[121:44.33]So let's get a calculator out here.
[121:48.05]So $5,000, you're going to donate $1 until you get to $5,000 every stream.
[121:52.35]If I stream three days a week,
[121:55.55]So there's 52 weeks in a year.
[121:58.21]So that's 52 divided by three.
[122:01.62]That's 17 streams ever.
[122:14.79]That's incorrect.
[122:15.47]156 streams.
[122:16.19]I was talking too fast.
[122:17.07]156 streams a year.
[122:18.10]Times five.
[122:18.46]Okay, 156 times 100.
[122:19.08]That's 15,000.
[122:21.64]156 times 20.
[122:45.13]You're talking about like 50 years.
[122:47.05]5,000 divided by 156.
[122:52.15]That's 32 years.
[123:01.19]Yeah.
[123:01.59]So you'll be watching for about another 30, 40 years here.
[123:08.12]Jerm IQ.
[123:12.24]Look, I'm not here right now.
[123:14.18]I'm barely... I'm just drifting through here right now.
[123:18.13]It's like 100 degrees in this room.
[123:19.85]I can't do math at 100 degrees.
[123:21.39]You know, like I can't.
[123:26.11]I am hydrating.
[123:27.67]It's too hot to do math.
[123:33.51]Yeah, the streamer already left.
[123:36.20]I'm the artificial intelligence that pretends to be him.
[123:41.50]Am I phoning in the stream?
[123:42.98]No.
[123:43.30]I mean, I'm currently on the phone, technically.
[123:51.27]You don't ever do math on stream.
[123:52.75]Yes, I do.
[123:55.09]You might be a new viewer, but we do math class here sometimes.
[123:58.60]I do like a two or three hour math session where we do algebra, geometry, calculus, trigonometry.
[124:07.37]Actually, I had a couple of articles written about me that I'm changing the landscape for education.
[124:14.13]New streamer on twitch.tv decides that he's going to have tutoring in live classroom.
[124:20.40]I'm fairly proud of it, right?
[124:25.33]Because you're not getting it from your classroom.
[124:27.61]You're not getting it from your teacher.
[124:28.65]And I know a lot about it.
[124:29.53]So I figured it would be an interesting way to change the game on Twitch.
[124:40.23]Thank you, Bakugan.
[124:42.37]See you in 32 years.
[124:45.31]Hippoo.
[124:45.91]Hippoopoo.
[124:46.53]Thanks for the $1.
[124:47.15]Hey, Jerma.
[124:47.49]Today is the fifth anniversary of when my father went missing.
[124:50.59]And over the past five years, I've missed him a ton.
[124:54.15]I thought I would be an emotional wreck today, but after watching your house flipping stream, it brought back all the good memories I had with him, and I feel somewhat at peace now.
[125:02.15]Thank you so much.
[125:02.83]You deserve all these bits.
[125:04.92]Also, this morning, when I went to the garage to look through our old photos, I found him fragging on Fortnite with the new Razer Death Adder.
[125:21.09]So that was a callback to that stream.
[125:27.30]Oy, oy, oy, Dad.
[125:29.30]Okay.
[125:31.35]Thank you, uh, Hip Poo Poo for the $1.
[125:34.23]Wall Dad has been found.
[125:37.69]Thank you, Sticks Renegade for the $1.
[125:39.17]Jeremiah still forgot the two things he said he'd do for me.
[125:42.10]You gotta tell me what they are!
[125:43.88]It's too hot down here to have a memory.
[125:45.94]I can't remember what happened ten minutes ago.
[125:47.54]It's so hot down here.
[125:48.38]I can't do anything down here.
[125:52.71]Hey, limited thanks for the $1.
[125:54.08]Hey, remember the other night you were talking about the subscription credits going faster when there's more subscriptions to read off?
[125:59.62]Maybe it's set to go for a certain amount of time.
[126:02.26]So the more words it has to show and the amount of time, the faster it travels.
[126:05.75]It absolutely is.
[126:07.33]But it seems that when I change it, I can't make it stick.
[126:15.09]Thank you for the tip, though.
[126:15.86]That is probably what's happening.
[126:21.06]Background music?
[126:21.72]Yeah, I got turned up a little bit.
[126:23.08]Just a little.
[126:24.92]Thank you, Limited.
[126:25.58]Thank you, Nova Maelstrom, for the $10.01 here.
[126:30.99]Saw your stream highlight with the balloons.
[126:34.03]I know it's late, but I just had to tell you how much you reminded me of this.
[126:38.20]Balloons?
[126:41.54]What, balloons?
[126:42.00]Balloons?
[126:50.35]Oh, this is, uh... Why is this... History Channel's still playing in the background.
[126:54.73]There we go.
[126:55.29]Alright, what's this?
[126:56.63]I like parties.
[126:57.75]It's balloons I don't like.
[126:59.29]Right.
[127:00.05]You don't like balloons.
[127:01.67]Oh, don't talk to me about balloons.
[127:03.45]Why?
[127:04.11]Balloons explode, Jen.
[127:05.97]They explode suddenly and unexpectedly.
[127:08.35]They're filled with the capacity to give me a little fright, and I find that unbearable.
[127:14.12]When's our...
[127:16.21]Yeah, that's true though.
[127:18.29]He's making a true statement.
[127:19.65]They just explode.
[127:20.69]It's horrifying.
[127:23.02]I don't like balloons.
[127:24.52]I agree.
[127:25.92]I want to meet that guy.
[127:28.30]Now all we have to do is we just have to stare right in each other's eyes for like 15 seconds and we'll just, uh-huh.
[127:33.88]I knew it.
[127:34.56]You too.
[127:35.22]Me too.
[127:37.94]But thank you, Nova.
[127:38.66]Thank you, wonderful telephone for the $1.
[127:40.10]I like that this has been a bee-friendly stream lately with all these bee jokes.
[127:42.90]Hashtag shave the bees.
[127:47.54]Don't fuck with bees.
[127:49.42]Especially honeybees.
[127:52.38]You like eating your Cheerios in the morning, don't you?
[127:55.02]Where do you think that comes from?
[127:57.91]Bees make it.
[127:59.87]They have little factories in their hive.
[128:02.89]They spin the wheat, they shit out the sweetener, and they ship it out to the warehouses.
[128:08.45]So, where do you think that comes from?
[128:14.07]Save the bees.
[128:16.47]Thank you hip poopoo Again for the $1.
[128:20.15]Hey Jeremy apologize for lying to you My father is still in my life and I cherish our relationship very much.
[128:25.10]It's awful to make a joke out of an issue Like that, but you know What won't lie to you?
[128:35.20]Something about a t-shirt
[128:37.81]It's all about t-shirts.
[128:40.23]And wearing them.
[128:41.57]I'm not an endorser of products here.
[128:45.09]I don't endorse products.
[128:51.24]Thank you, though.
[128:52.28]Thank you, TotoBunny for the $10.
[128:53.80]Monster Rancher.
[128:56.80]It's a great game.
[128:57.66]Thank you, Toto.
[129:01.10]That was not a Fireman shirt.
[129:04.83]I would plug the Fireman shirt because that is a... Everyone has to own one.
[129:11.27]Thank you, Toto, for the 10 bucks.
[129:12.47]Monster Rancher, yes.
[129:13.23]Thank you, Killcode, for the $1.
[129:14.77]I wore my Fireman shirt to work after earlier... Whoa, Jeremy.
[129:19.31]It's too hot to talk in here.
[129:22.37]The words come out and then the heat just distorts them.
[129:25.31]I said that correctly.
[129:26.55]That's the worst part about that.
[129:28.01]I said it correctly and by the time it traveled to the microphone, it went through the heat index and was warped.
[129:34.75]I hate having to go back and have to say things again because the heat index warps my voice.
[129:37.79]It's annoying.
[129:41.79]But thank you, Killcode.
[129:42.43]I wore my Fireman shirt to work again earlier this week after using the WikiHow article on removing a curse.
[129:49.69]And nothing started on fire.
[129:52.55]I think you're safe now, Jeremy.
[129:54.13]Also, hi.
[129:57.27]Thanks.
[129:58.19]That's good.
[129:59.95]Remove the curse.
[130:01.89]I could definitely dodge a cannonball, I'm certain of it.
[130:03.53]Let's see.
[130:03.79]How fast does a cannonball travel?
[130:04.67]Cannonball.
[130:28.48]I guess this really shouldn't be called the launch speed since this is the speed after the cannonball.
[130:32.84]Oh, well, it looks something like the starting speed is between 100 meters a second and 200 meters a second.
[130:41.53]Give us something better than that.
[130:43.41]Hey, this is a better one.
[130:49.06]Give me MPH here.
[130:54.38]Depends on the cannon and the cannonball.
[130:55.88]A strong cannon will let you use a powerful powder mix, and a well-fitted cannonball will use that energy better.
[131:01.21]A hollow, lighter cannonball will have a faster muzzle speed.
[131:05.03]Where's the miles per hour?
[131:08.83]1,440 feet per second.
[131:11.73]It's pretty accurate, okay.
[131:14.47]So if you're over 5,000 feet away, and somebody shoots a cannon, 200 meters per second is 450 miles per hour.
[131:20.84]Yeah, but...
[131:24.73]so you guys look up in the air and you can see a plane and the plane is going 500 potential miles per hour look how slow that's going in the head you can just watch the whole thing it's in slow motion that's not that fast
[131:48.39]But our physics Even 500 miles per hour though, I swear if you were a half mile away from me or a mile away from me and you shot a 500 mile per hour object it would be it would get there in One two, you'd have two seconds to get out of the way.
[132:07.80]You just watch it and just dive right when you see the fire and
[132:15.80]You know, actually, when I was little, I used to be really, really concerned when a plane or a helicopter would fly by because I actually thought that the people looking out the windows in the airplane could see me.
[132:30.07]That people in the window seat looking down, oh, look, there's a kid there.
[132:34.29]And it freaked me out.
[132:35.15]I didn't like it.
[132:40.15]They can.
[132:42.47]No, they can't.
[132:43.25]I was like six years old.
[132:46.79]I love how anytime I tell a story like this, people just assume that, hey, when I was younger, oh, so you mean when you were like 28?
[132:54.11]No, no, no, when I was like six.
[133:01.42]Every time I tell a story about when I was a kid, people assume, whoa, what are you, stupid?
[133:06.80]I can't believe a 25-plus-year-old thinks like this.
[133:12.14]Younger is one week ago, apparently, yeah.
[133:18.39]Oh, guys, when I was a little kid, I used to eat Captain Crunch for dinner every night.
[133:21.77]Holy shit, dude, what's wrong with you?
[133:25.74]You graduated college!
[133:27.20]Are you kidding me?
[133:33.38]Deranged.
[133:37.72]That's actually weird.
[133:41.06]Yeah, but...
[133:43.08]We already talked about that story.
[133:44.28]My parents used to make me a little bowl of Captain Crunch so I would eat dinner.
[133:50.70]No, I don't want to eat dinner.
[133:51.98]I don't want to eat peas and mashed potatoes.
[133:54.71]Do you want Captain Crunch?
[133:55.85]Yeah.
[133:56.63]Okay.
[133:56.99]Well, I mean, you have to have, if you eat dinner, you get to have Captain Crunch.
[133:59.39]I do.
[134:00.45]That's right.
[134:00.85]And I thought I was playing them.
[134:05.07]They would give me a little bowl just enough for me to like have two or three bites.
[134:08.40]Really, that's all it was.
[134:09.66]And I thought I was playing them, but they were playing me the whole time.
[134:18.17]Every night going to bed, I'd be like, yeah, got you, motherfucker.
[134:21.07]I am such a scientist-level intelligence.
[134:26.75]But anyways, I gotta go to a doctor tonight.
[134:28.49]Go, go, go, go, go.
[134:31.81]Thank you, Imperial Mandate, for the $50 earlier.
[134:33.73]Thank you so much.
[134:36.73]We touched on it before, but thank you so much for $50, dude.
[134:42.08]Re-wows, thanks for the one dollar.
[134:43.36]My favorite part of that pickle pie joke is why does the story start in a graveyard?
[134:47.85]It holds no continuity within the rest of the story.
[134:58.17]It's called stream of consciousness.
[135:02.95]With wires removed.
[135:05.76]Sugar, Sugar Shin, thank you for the one dollar.
[135:10.93]Hello, Aunt Jermima.
[135:12.39]I'm currently catching up on all your VODs, but I wanted to leave a quick donation while you were live.
[135:17.42]Also, do you have any plans on getting the new Smash Brothers when it comes out?
[135:21.64]I think it would be a fun stream if you fought some of your viewers.
[135:25.28]If not, that's cool, but I figured I'd leave the suggestion.
[135:27.52]Anyways, love you, Drew Moose.
[135:29.46]Also, mind eraser frog emote when?
[135:34.35]We're currently voting for a frog right now.
[135:37.13]There's a frog on the menu.
[135:40.19]If you want it, vote for it.
[135:41.59]If not, then don't vote for it.
[135:45.14]But... I think I'll probably play Smash a little.
[135:51.04]We'll see.
[135:51.36]I still have to get a Switch.
[135:52.28]I still have to do the Nintendo Labo stream.
[135:54.54]I might just do that on Sunday.
[135:56.40]Fuck it, right?
[135:58.19]Okay.
[135:59.19]Let's do that.
[135:59.77]I'm doing it on Sunday.
[136:01.25]I'm gonna get the Nintendo Labo and I'm gonna do that stupid joke I've wanted to do since April.
[136:12.31]I'm just gonna have to say it because then that means it has to happen.
[136:14.43]So, see you on Sunday.
[136:19.29]Thank you, Dunkey.
[136:19.79]You're risen for the $1.
[136:20.73]That salty sailor voice was actually really good.
[136:22.87]Nice one, Jermbo.
[136:23.63]Have you ever considered voice work?
[136:27.01]A huge amount of my adult life was I wanted to be a voice actor.
[136:31.28]One of the number one things I've always wanted to do.
[136:34.96]So, yeah, I have considered it.
[136:36.68]Thank you, though.
[136:38.61]silver flame thanks for the one dollar hey Jerma I burnt my thumb badly yesterday so I thought what would Jerma do so I cried like a loser uh love you moi kisses and hugs sweet prince I don't cry guys I don't cry from physical pain I cry from emotional distress right my arm could get lopped off
[137:00.53]And a handsaw.
[137:01.27]And I'd be like, whoa!
[137:02.71]Oh man, I gotta deal with this problem.
[137:05.01]This is something that has to... Hospital trip, probably?
[137:07.49]I think it might have to do that.
[137:10.95]That's like a Hallmark card commercial on TV during the holidays.
[137:14.75]I will cry.
[137:15.23]Just the way it is.
[137:28.63]Proof?
[137:30.29]Proof?
[137:31.15]I don't have a camera pointed at me when I watch TV.
[137:40.05]Yeah, you could like stab me in the stomach with a knife and I'd be like, dude, ooh, there's blood in there.
[137:46.89]Uh-oh.
[137:48.98]Dog?
[137:49.82]Dog in pain on TV commercial?

[138:21.57]Thank you, Stix Renegade, for the $1.
[138:22.75]What about the subs?
[138:23.47]If a stream turns off, could you still get the list of people who subbed during the stream before the stream started?
[138:28.79]No, I cannot.
[138:31.71]Unless I maybe go back here.
[138:34.85]Let me see if I can do that.
[138:36.10]I'll try to do that, actually.
[138:37.92]I'm going to have to do that through the dashboard.
[138:40.70]At the end of the bits, we'll do that.
[138:43.86]Thank you, Stix, though.

[139:42.03]This one's long.
[139:43.47]I'll keep this brief.
[139:44.59]If I sent you a video, the max length should be 2 minutes and 30 seconds.
[139:48.59]I'd like it from your mouth rather than chat.
[139:52.18]What do you mean a video?
[139:54.80]No, the get Jeremy to click on a video link, it's got to be less than a minute.
[140:00.12]It's got to be 45 seconds long.
[140:05.80]Two, three, four minute videos, I mean, at that point we're watching TV on stream.
[140:10.37]You know what I'm saying?

[140:27.11]There's a fly that's NBC.
[140:30.17]Oh, it's Comcast.
[140:31.75]Who are you?
[140:32.09]It's me, the Comcast bug.
[140:33.11]I'm the glitch that ruins all of Jerma streams.
[140:35.55]You and I are one in the same.
[140:37.53]We are the biggest Jerma trolls.
[140:38.87]Join me and we can swat.
[140:40.91]He got the Comcast bug.
[140:42.83]I can't say I didn't see that one coming.
[140:44.82]I was expecting a more festive punchline and he did it again.
[140:46.98]I hate all of you.
[140:51.60]30 minute episode of snow.
[140:53.60]We're not watching TV episodes.
[140:59.83]Slow chat.
[141:02.47]No, I mean, stream's over.
[141:07.21]You know, I haven't really... What's the number... I wonder what the data's like.
[141:11.39]I could look at it probably through an analytical tool on Twitch.
[141:15.01]But how many people actually leave the stream right when it's like, that's it, and here we go, here comes the subs.
[141:22.42]It's usually at least a thousand, right?
[141:24.82]From my own anecdotal evidence.
[141:30.25]It's like half.
[141:31.11]Yeah.
[141:32.57]Figured.
[141:33.11]This much.
[141:34.07]At least two and a half.
[141:38.67]You used to do it?
[141:40.23]Yeah, I never expect anybody to stay.
[141:41.63]I'm just curious as to how many people stick around for the last part where we read the bits and subs and stuff.
[141:49.51]Alright, almost done.
[141:50.53]Thank you Spreo for the five dollars.
[141:51.73]Thanks for making me almost choke on my food during that insanity.
[141:55.50]It was very fun.
[141:57.10]Thank you for the $5, Sprio.
[141:58.98]Byte1223, thanks for the $1.
[142:00.79]That was a load of fun.
[142:01.59]Hope we can get lucky again with no one ruining it.
[142:04.15]Happy I could have joined you from the beginning.
[142:07.21]Thanks for playing.
[142:09.47]I mean, it was alright.
[142:10.41]It got a little hairy there at the end.
[142:12.71]And during that big open session.
[142:16.92]You just gotta be careful, man.
[142:18.24]It's so easy for somebody just to say something fucking insane or horrible.
[142:21.56]You just gotta be careful.
[142:26.63]but thank you hole of one zombie for the one dollar you think you will do any more podcasts again also where the fuck did you get bungle from rainbow from that bear is creepy what from what I don't know what you're referring to but podcasts I really want to do one I want to start doing it once every couple weeks instead of a stream have just something to talk about and just go
[142:57.06]Maybe some stuff on the screen.
[142:58.22]We can pull up some articles.
[142:59.78]Nothing like, oh, gaming news and journalism.
[143:03.19]Okay.
[143:03.87]So, guys, I heard that Kingdom Hearts 3 has a new trailer.
[143:07.79]No, I don't want to do that.
[143:10.41]We're not doing that.
[143:14.55]Like, the podcast that I would run would be like, what would you do?
[143:18.10]Like, how would you go through day to day?
[143:20.96]If you had to... If a dinosaur was like a pet of yours or something.
[143:23.74]You know what I mean?
[143:25.12]That's what I want to talk about.
[143:26.02]If you have a velociraptor instead of a dog, what would your life be like?
[143:30.42]That's better.
[143:30.80]I think that's more interesting to me.
[143:35.21]But anyways, thank you, Holo1Zombie.
[143:37.51]Thank you.
[143:37.77]It's time for slime for the 10 bucks.

[143:48.73]Oh, that was cool.
[143:52.82]I love this, actually.

[145:01.04]Why is that name so familiar?
[145:01.96]It's a familiar name.
[145:09.10]Oh, he did.
[145:09.60]Okay.
[145:15.86]I don't know who he is.

[147:37.06]We'll have fun on Sunday.
[147:39.65]Uh, thank you, Zarina, for the two dollars.
[147:42.33]Hey, Jerma, I imagine you've heard of Rasputin.
[147:44.53]I have.
[147:45.47]He's the guy that was blamed for the downfall of the Russian monarchy and was only killed after being poisoned, shot, and drowned in a frozen river.
[147:52.92]He's such an infamous character in Russian history that they decided to preserve his penis.
[147:59.26]What?
[148:01.02]I have no idea why, but it's preserved in a jar in a museum.
[148:05.69]Is that true?
[148:08.99]It's true.
[148:12.62]Okay.
[148:14.10]That's interesting.
[148:15.48]Thank you, Donna Jello, for the $1.
[148:17.48]The Horn Gus.
[148:22.65]What the fuck are you writing here?
[148:27.05]A fish is attached.
[148:29.80]I can't even read this.
[148:33.43]Nuts, I know you're trying to get me to read a sentence of total buffoonery and I refuse but thank you for the $1 Thank You Donna jello Thank You CAD TV CAD B TV for the $5 I'm a certified cannon engineer and I will tell you what we use the cannons in the lab to play dodgeball and
[148:58.17]They're very easy to dodge, and I think your nimbleness with your natural compactness would do well to dodge them no problem.
[149:03.53]See?
[149:04.45]We've got an engineer here.
[149:07.23]Thank you, Ken, for clearing that up.
[149:10.03]Hey, Glyphbin, thanks for the $1.
[149:11.85]I can't wait to watch Jerma's collab with Criss Angel, in which they dodge a cannonball while handcuffed together.
[149:23.93]Oh, by the way, speaking of Las Vegas, I don't know why I thought about this, but when I was looking up just stuff to do in Vegas and Chris Angel's show that he used to do apparently was a disaster.
[149:35.25]His show apparently was so fucking awful that people would walk out.
[149:41.87]And not just one person.
[149:43.49]If you go to the TripAdvisor reviews of his show, half of them say that they left the show early because it was so awful.
[149:52.10]And it was so depressing to hear it because I wanted to go see it.
[149:56.67]It doesn't exist anymore, I don't think.
[149:58.03]It stopped in 2016 or something.
[150:03.12]I would have loved to go see one of the worst shows in Vegas.
[150:07.08]But you brought him up, so there's my little story about that.
[150:11.02]I wonder why.
[150:12.24]Yeah, I guess he didn't even do magic.
[150:14.07]He would do a couple of tricks and he would talk about stuff for like an hour and 10 minutes.
[150:17.57]Apparently the show is just, it was so phoned in that people couldn't even believe it existed in the first place.
[150:27.56]But thank you, Glyphbin.
[150:29.76]Thank you, Manboy for the $1.
[150:31.08]Hey, Jerma, I made this while watching the stream.
[150:32.66]It's a quick video.
[150:34.12]And if you have the time, I would love if you could watch it with the stream.
[150:44.85]I do not have time.
[150:46.27]This is about three minutes long.
[150:49.59]I would love to watch this right now, but I'm pressed for time right now.
[150:53.96]It's this.
[150:54.70]It's right here.
[150:57.77]If I didn't have to leave in less than 15 minutes, then I would absolutely watch this.
[151:01.97]But Jerma.85 clicks on a link and it's a video.
[151:04.39]It's got to be less than 45 seconds.
[151:12.39]What is happening?
[151:13.57]Where are you going?
[151:16.63]Oh, I've read that as in like, what's happening where you are?
[151:20.31]I'm going to the doctor.
[151:21.83]I have a doctor's appointment very soon.
[151:26.06]Go to the doctor.
[151:26.60]Well, I'm fine.
[151:27.04]I'm okay as long as I leave in ten minutes.
[151:29.98]So, we only got like three or four more bits to do, so we're good.
[151:32.76]But thank you, Manboy.
[151:33.48]I will watch it after the stream, and I will definitely laugh out loud, probably.
[151:38.42]I would comment on it, but I'm only allowed to have one post on that account.
[151:41.06]I have one... I have a Reddit account, and the name of the account is Jerma's One Reddit Post.
[151:45.95]And I posted one time.
[151:47.37]I'm not... I can't use that account ever again.
[151:50.83]Uh, thank you to Adorable Cockroach for the ten bucks.
[151:55.03]It says, sad doggo.
[151:58.89]Yep.
[151:59.97]Sad doggo on TV.
[152:05.01]Thank you so much, adorable cockroach.
[152:07.30]Thank you, Silverflame, for the $1.
[152:08.76]Hey, it's the burnt thumb guy.
[152:10.88]Sorry about accusing you of robbing me.
[152:12.50]Anyways, any chance of you playing another build a park game?
[152:16.00]I think Zoo Tycoon 2 or the new Jurassic Park game could be a cool stream.
[152:21.22]Anyway, smooches.
[152:22.24]Thank you.
[152:23.64]I actually own Zoo Tycoon 2.
[152:25.76]It's sitting right behind me.
[152:29.18]I was going to make a video on it, I thought.
[152:32.00]But I never really got around to it.
[152:33.62]I played it for like 10-20 minutes.
[152:35.74]It wasn't really doing it for me.
[152:36.72]But on a stream, that might be actually pretty fun.
[152:38.72]Because you can have dinosaurs in that game.
[152:40.23]You actually can have Godzilla in that game.
[152:44.65]Expect it.
[152:45.35]We'll do it.
[152:47.21]Whole of One Zombie, thanks for the $1.
[152:48.69]You mentioned Bungle in the podcast.
[152:50.49]He's a bear from the UK 70s program Rainbow.
[152:53.40]Oh, right.
[152:54.90]Okay.
[152:56.38]Remember, I forget 75% of everything I've ever said.
[153:00.38]So, but thanks.
[153:03.32]And last but not least, thank you.
[153:05.00]Fourth consecutive line for the $15.
[153:08.82]Hey, Jeremiah, I love all that you do.
[153:10.56]Please just keep being you and producing amazing content.
[153:13.00]I wish you the best in your move and all the future endeavors.
[153:15.64]As long as you're here, I'll keep watching.
[153:18.14]Love you, Jeremy.
[153:18.82]Thank you.
[153:20.08]Fourth consecutive line.
[153:25.00]I'm glad you enjoy the streams.
[153:30.56]I hope you continue to watch.
[153:33.48]And with that, that is going to be the end.
[153:35.58]Thank you everybody so much for sticking around.
[153:37.66]Sorry again for the erratic split up two hour stream here.
[153:42.00]Like two or three hour stream.
[153:44.26]Again, I want to make it very clear.
[153:45.79]The emote contest voting is closing later tonight at midnight eastern time.
[153:52.53]If you haven't voted, please do.
[153:55.87]Community emotes voting closes tonight.
[154:00.29]And I'm not going to be around until Sunday.
[154:03.24]So I'll see you guys on Sunday, probably afternoon.
[154:07.92]Much love to you.
[154:09.00]Take care.
[154:10.12]See you very soon.
