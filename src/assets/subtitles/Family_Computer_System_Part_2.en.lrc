[03:35.11]It's the range of what?
[03:37.51]But what is the... I don't understand.
[03:38.55]1 through 12.
[03:38.91]The numbers are so you can write it afterwards.
[03:44.68]1 through 12?
[03:45.78]That doesn't make any sense.
[03:48.28]Ooey gooey.
[03:49.16]I know.
[03:49.48]Just wait.
[03:49.76]Wait.
[03:56.14]What if he doesn't eat it with his skin on?
[03:59.99]Okay.
[04:01.15]So, I've got a drink, too.

[04:03.81]And I've got french fries, obviously.
[04:06.29]So, as you guys know, I don't really eat fast food.
[04:10.69]I'm not a fast food guy.
[04:12.27]I don't really like it.
[04:13.35]I find it to be... It's not for me.
[04:15.96]So, I'm not sure I'm going to like this.
[04:17.80]I really don't think it's going to be something I enjoy.
[04:19.62]Not a fast food guy.
[04:22.18]Me.
[04:23.10]Don't eat it very often.
[04:25.11]So, I'll give it a try though.
[04:26.55]I'll try it.
[04:27.01]We're going to start with the Whopper.
[04:29.75]This is the Whopper with cheese.
[04:30.83]I don't know about this.
[04:33.47]I don't know if I'm going to like this.
[04:35.01]Let's see what it looks like.
[04:39.58]Okay.
[04:42.22]It doesn't look that bad.
[04:43.00]It looks okay.
[04:45.50]This is the Whopper.
[04:47.06]Hmm.
[04:49.54]I don't know about this.
[04:51.44]I'll try it.
[04:52.16]I'll try a bite.
[04:53.46]And we'll see.
[04:55.91]Okay, I'm gonna go for a bite.
[05:03.22]Oh my god.

[06:10.50]It was so hard to do that.
[06:44.92]Hi.
[06:46.99]I took two bites.
[07:11.21]I knew I was gonna fuck the whole thing up.
[07:12.53]I'm sorry.
[07:20.38]Somebody wrote in chat.
[07:21.08]I shouldn't have looked at chat at all.
[07:22.50]Somebody wrote, why the fuck is he doing this?
[07:25.24]And there was no capitals.
[07:28.64]It was just a random name.
[07:29.78]Oh my god.
[07:33.52]I couldn't even get through two bites of doing it.
[07:37.41]Ugh.
[07:40.87]I fucking hate this but I'm alright let's go this is it's not bad it's okay oh my god I can't I can't do it anymore I'm not gonna do oh my god anymore
[08:13.90]actually like Burger King sauce went through my nose Burger King sauce went into my nostrils and out of my nose and coke at the same time that sucked that was not fun that was horrible um anyways let's let's go on I did like wipe my nose
[08:41.55]I have whatever's on here coming out of my nose.
[08:48.32]Please stop this.
[08:51.58]Let me describe how it tastes.
[08:56.00]Okay.
[08:57.32]I love the, what I really love about this the most is definitely the cheese.
[09:02.17]It's got this ooey gooey cheese on it that just melts and gets all over the patty.
[09:11.48]And the pickle, perfect amount of acidity.
[09:14.14]It's actually pretty good.
[09:22.07]I don't hate it.
[09:26.39]Describe the cheese with some adjectives.
[09:29.84]Um, thin.
[09:33.18]Sliced.
[09:37.14]American.
[09:39.52]Um...
[09:41.08]Fresh patty.
[09:45.87]That one wasn't for a joke.
[09:47.57]This one was real.
[09:52.99]You're describing yourself.
[09:58.73]What's the right amount of acidity exactly?
[10:00.43]I don't know.
[10:02.59]Just enough for you to get the little sourness.
[10:05.07]You get the vinegar flavor.
[10:10.91]potatoes.
[10:12.62]They're perfectly crispy.
[10:17.18]They're a little gross.
[10:20.38]But they're they're pretty good.
[10:23.23]I should like Burger King fries.
[10:28.27]10k people are watching this cursed garbage.
[10:42.36]All I want... All I wanted out of this was that first scene of the... Oh, my God.
[10:48.78]Because I want you to use it wherever you want.
[10:55.49]Say, Ushi, no.
[11:00.41]And you guys, seriously, you wanted me to do that the entire time I ate this fucking hamburger?
[11:05.92]There's no way I would have done that.
[11:11.01]Every single time I take a bite, I was supposed to do that.
[11:15.63]I took two, three bites and I went into a full meltdown.
[11:17.97]I couldn't do it.
[11:18.43]I can't do that.
[11:20.71]What would you use that for?
[11:21.85]I don't know.
[11:22.31]For a fucking school project.
[11:24.23]You could use it as a school project.
[11:29.26]Is it weird that I find this part to be disgusting and I don't want to bite that part?
[11:31.98]You know what I mean?
[11:33.86]Yeah.
[11:38.34]Yeah.
[11:41.25]Oh my goodness, it's like in my nose.
[11:44.71]Bite that part?
[11:45.65]I don't like tomato and shit.
[11:47.53]I don't like to- there's too much stuff on here.
[11:52.00]I'm gonna part your hair down the middle.
[11:53.20]No.
[12:04.64]Okay.
[12:06.50]A little bit of sourness.
[12:09.06]Why is the toothbrush still there?
[12:12.06]Because I feel like I want it there.
[12:18.66]You know, I'm actually excited to try the chicken sandwich.
[12:24.38]Stop looking at me in the eyes when you chew.
[12:27.78]What, you don't do that when you're hanging out with your friends?
[12:30.26]You go to a restaurant?
[12:32.42]You don't do that?
[12:33.98]Is it weird that I do that?
[12:37.32]When I let them out of the restaurant, I usually do this.
[12:39.22]I usually take a big bite of the food like this.
[12:48.58]I don't want to make a mess.
[12:52.82]Fucking god damn it.
[13:11.29]Oh, whoopsie.
[13:15.66]It's kind of weird, but it's not that bad.
[13:17.58]I don't do that to... What are you... This is... We're just having a fun routine here.
[13:24.08]Oh, this is going to... This bite right here.
[13:25.48]That's going to be a zonk bite.
[13:32.86]Zonk bite.
[13:36.40]Mm-hmm.
[13:39.26]He's absolutely zonked.
[13:44.21]What is it?
[13:44.61]Zoink?
[13:46.20]What do you guys say?
[13:46.88]How's the sauce?
[13:52.34]It's pretty good.
[13:54.25]It's kind of a combination of... Although I will give... I'm going to give Doc some points here on the Whopper.
[14:00.07]It's a little runny.
[14:01.69]I don't like runny sauce.
[14:03.79]So this is a little runny.
[14:06.89]Once you get to the middle here.
[14:13.21]Yeah.
[14:13.85]That's too runny.
[14:15.78]That's too running.
[14:16.72]You get minus one full letter grade.
[14:23.51]Put on predictions for what?
[14:33.66]What?
[14:36.24]Is this man going to die?
[14:38.00]I mean, like eventually and like probably like hopefully 50 years.
[14:43.60]predicted if you can eat the whole burger in one more in one more minute the whole rest of the burger in one minute um no actually you know what I could probably do it let me take can I alright hold on one minute's a long time you can do it you are far the rest of this in one minute
[15:12.83]Wait, I can wait money off the debt if I get to do this in one minute.
[15:15.75]Why do you know to predict?
[15:16.84]I can do it.
[15:17.24]I know I can.
[15:22.14]100 million?
[15:22.42]That's not worth it.
[15:23.42]I'll have diarrhea in like fucking four hours.
[15:26.14]No, none of this is worth it.
[15:26.90]Nope, not doing that.
[15:27.48]I'm just going to enjoy it.
[15:28.68]If you eat a hamburger as fast as you can, guys, you're going to shit your pants.
[15:39.25]You're going to go, it's going to be horrible.
[15:41.62]If you eat a full fucking cheeseburger in less than two minutes, you're going to have diarrhea.
[15:46.60]It's going to happen.
[15:47.54]It doesn't matter from what restaurant.
[15:48.72]You can make it at your house on your sofa or your sewing machine.
[15:53.27]You can make it in your own house, and it's still going to happen.
[15:58.35]Okay, the french fries have still got the crisp.
[16:02.37]Get a look.
[16:05.01]Pretty decently salted.
[16:05.77]Okay.

[16:52.00]Yep.
[16:54.48]Your camera's off center?
[16:55.42]I'll fix that.
[17:00.98]How about now?
[17:10.03]The chicken sandwich, I'm going to give it a minute, though.
[17:17.01]Jeremy, eat a salad.
[17:17.73]You're getting fat.
[17:20.81]Good.
[17:21.59]That's what I want.
[17:23.73]I want to just grow in size.
[17:27.01]I want to be... I told you I was trying to put weight on.
[17:29.53]I told you that.
[17:31.71]I was like 130 pounds like five months ago, six months ago.
[17:35.49]I've put on like 25 pounds of pure, absolutely fat.
[17:39.27]There's none of its muscle.
[17:40.28]I haven't really worked out at all.
[17:41.24]I've been trying to do some walking lightly.
[17:44.02]Oh, it's all fat.
[17:44.90]All of it.
[17:48.29]But, I've been gaining weight.
[17:58.49]I want to top out somewhere around like 155.
[18:01.57]That's where I'm like, alright, slow down.
[18:07.94]And guys, I'm not eating like Burger King fucking Whoppers every day to gain weight.
[18:14.18]No.
[18:15.30]I'll give you an endorsement here.
[18:17.67]This is the endorsement part of the stream.
[18:21.82]Those Heels, I got that Heel for a reason.
[18:24.96]I drank that shit every day, morning and night, to try to put on some weight.
[18:29.20]And it's not like bad calories.
[18:31.34]There's no dead calories in that.
[18:33.64]It actually helped a lot.
[18:36.52]Being able to take the extra calories with liquid.
[18:39.20]That's not just junk.
[18:41.42]And there's no soy in that.
[18:43.18]Stop saying it.
[18:44.10]I keep seeing that in the chat room and it's making me very upset.
[18:47.57]There is no soy in Huel.
[18:49.41]It's soy free.
[18:50.47]And I know you linked a bunch of bullshit, but the ones I have don't have soy in them.
[18:56.75]There's no soy in Huel.
[19:00.75]You're upsetting me.
[19:03.83]Okay, predict it.
[19:05.95]No, no, no, don't predict it.
[19:07.24]You can just game this.
[19:08.94]Okay, do you guys, when you have a french fry, how many folders we got here in the chat?
[19:14.22]How many folders we got?
[19:20.01]We got folders in here?
[19:22.17]How many folders we got, right?
[19:24.53]How many folders we got?
[19:25.35]That's what a serial killer does.
[19:31.47]How many serial killers are here?
[19:37.12]If it's too big, you have to spring it in there.
[19:39.66]You can't fold little ones.
[19:48.18]How many of you guys are, when you get the little thin ones, you go like this, kind of like a bunny rabbit?
[19:55.07]I mean, I know nobody's, when I know nobody's watching, I do that.
[20:03.75]How many of you guys are just, are full swallowers, you know?
[20:07.40]We've got folders, we have chompers, what about swallowers?
[20:09.76]You know, you just, it's gone.
[20:13.80]And sometimes you're hungry.
[20:23.63]This is... Dude, I choked and fucking... I'm so glad I got out of the camera's way.
[20:31.37]Like, ten minutes ago.
[20:34.19]I read that chat message saying, like, why the fuck is he doing this?
[20:38.19]And... I hope... Did I get down fast enough?
[20:44.47]Did I get down there fast enough before, like, this liquid started coming out of my nose?
[20:47.61]I hope so.
[20:53.80]What about Splitters?
[20:54.42]Oh! My-
[21:00.42]Dude, the thing that everybody-
[21:01.42]Onion! Oh- A onion ring! I got a onion ring!
[21:10.42]Burger King just got half of a point right there.
[21:13.42]You always get one onion ring. Treasure chest. Buried into the sand of french fries.
[21:18.42]That's a huge moment. That's a huge moment.
[21:27.09]um I'm kind of freaking myself out because why would how does that happen I didn't like hit the ground or anything right why does that happen they use the same vat okay it's not like a weird scenario where like they just like fell all over the counter and somebody was like just stripped them in you're paranoid
[22:02.62]Don't... That's cigarette bullshit.
[22:04.20]Alright, I want to try the chicken sandwich.
[22:06.72]Ah, mm-mm.
[22:13.33]Already hate it.
[22:14.93]Already hate it.
[22:16.37]Oh, it's getting everywhere.
[22:17.29]Already hate it.
[22:24.03]I don't know about this one.
[22:26.85]I know what a McChicken is like.
[22:27.99]And... Mmm...
[22:33.31]we'll see we'll see it's a little sloppy the lettuce is not perfectly packed let's give it a try I'm gonna give it a solid bite
[23:00.61]It's not even close to the McChicken.
[23:02.95]Not even close.
[23:10.89]The outside has this weird texture to it.
[23:15.82]Where it's like they tried to make it crispy.
[23:17.84]Like a pretend crispy.
[23:18.80]It just kind of tastes like you're chewing on breadcrumbs.
[23:28.24]Mm-mm.
[23:30.38]No, McChicken's 10 times better.
[23:31.44]Mm-hmm.
[23:40.49]Nice try, though.
[23:41.39]Nice try, Burger King.
[23:42.25]Nice try.
[23:43.01]Not even close.
[23:43.45]Burger King is in chat.
[24:04.48]You got King?
[24:06.44]Whatever.
[24:11.53]Clown in chat.
[24:15.85]No, it's just not as good.
[24:18.19]You know what?
[24:18.59]Burger King... Alright, I have to give points.
[24:22.04]If we're going to be real here.
[24:25.72]These are... If they're fresh and they're hot and they just came out, these are better than McDonald's.
[24:34.45]I have to be honest.
[24:40.24]But almost everything else.
[24:41.86]And, I mean, Burger King has onion rings.
[24:44.17]And you get an onion ring treasure?
[24:47.09]That's a big deal.
[24:49.79]Mm-mm.
[24:51.48]But I...
[24:54.33]I don't want to... Oh, it's here.
[24:55.83]Might as well play with it for a little while.
[24:57.83]Hey, everybody.
[24:59.62]How are you doing?
[25:01.40]This sounds like I have the filter turned on, but I don't.
[25:03.48]This is just me normally talking, and there's something really wrong.
[25:06.02]Start talking.
[25:06.67]Morty.
[25:07.07]Morty.
[25:07.43]Hey, Morty.
[25:09.87]Hey, Morty.
[25:10.79]Morty.
[25:11.03]Yeah, we got an adventure to go on, Morty.
[25:28.51]Nobody... Nobody heard that.
[25:32.93]Good.
[25:38.64]I almost puked, though.
[25:39.68]Like... I'm so glad I got out of the way and stopped when I did.
[25:44.06]I almost fucking puked on stream.
[25:45.50]Just, like, not because the food was bad, but because I was, like, choking.
[25:56.15]I can't read chat when I eat.
[25:57.49]You guys just fucking do it to me.
[26:15.93]12.4k people here watching you do this.
[26:21.40]okay yeah that's fine right there are more than 12 000 people here watching this but this wouldn't happen every day if I just ate like McDonald's and birkin and Wendy's every day on stream do you think you'd really stick around for that long would you really stick around for that long you yeah you say you would but in a week half of you guys just be like this fucking keeps doing this I'm done I'm out of here
[26:50.53]I would watch you more.
[26:51.51]You say that, but like in two months, when I've eaten like the 30th McChicken on stream, you'd be like, alright, I'm going to find somebody else to watch.
[26:58.19]He keeps doing this.
[27:01.57]And by the way, these are too big.
[27:05.23]Like these are huge.
[27:09.77]Where do you put these?
[27:12.37]I mean, I like it, but these are too big.
[27:18.41]You mean small.
[27:23.97]How much liquid is actually inside of here?
[27:26.70]This is a large Coke.
[27:29.16]I feel like the two liter bottle is in here.
[27:37.22]Okay.
[27:39.59]Final review.
[27:42.41]The Burger King Whopper.
[27:45.75]It's going to get out of 10.
[28:00.10]It's somewhere in the sixes.
[28:04.88]It's like 6.4.
[28:10.09]Yeah, 6.4.
[28:13.93]I think so.
[28:16.29]A quarter pounder is honestly, a quarter pounder is not very much better, but it is.
[28:20.35]I would give a quarter pounder like a 7.8 for a quarter pounder.
[28:29.87]I just like McDonald's better.
[28:35.30]Arbitrary numbers.
[28:38.16]Okay, so... Something's in here.
[28:42.64]I can, like, feel it, like, blocking my nasal passage.
[28:50.29]I'm gonna, like, go into the sink and go... And, like, a fucking french fry is gonna come up.
[28:59.01]It's a worm.
[29:00.27]It's not a fucking worm.
[29:03.50]What about Chuck E. Cheese?
[29:06.22]But that's pizza.
[29:07.62]They don't have burgers at Chuck E. Cheese, do they?
[29:14.92]Move out of the way for Otto.
[29:23.23]Alright, let me clean this up.
[29:24.19]I've eaten.
[29:25.67]That was the... Oh my god.
[29:34.13]The Burger King McChicken gets 5.
[29:35.71]I don't like it.
[29:43.11]I can't believe I almost puked on stream.
[29:45.27]When I was setting this up, I was like, there's no way I will puke on stream.
[29:48.81]No way.
[29:53.81]It was really close.
[29:54.71]Alright, I'll be right back.
[29:57.55]Alright, let me clean up.
[30:00.35]Best puke of 2021.
[30:01.07]Well, it'll be the only puke of 2021.
[30:06.79]Alright, I'll be right back.
[30:07.69]We're gonna go back to that little console.
[30:10.06]Figured that was the best thing to do today.
[30:11.76]So I'll be right back.
[30:12.49]We'll get started.
[30:13.25]See you in a minute.
[32:35.85]God, that was fucking ridiculous.
[32:38.11]I just blew out so much, like, junk.
[32:43.87]I just, like, oh my god, it was bad.
[32:50.09]Kidney stone?
[32:50.85]No, no, no.
[32:56.30]We heard it.
[32:58.58]No, I'm fine.
[33:00.74]Oh, pog, pog moment.
[33:01.98]A little piece of, like, weird lettuce on the counter.
[33:06.95]Oh, nice!
[33:07.53]Alright, let's play this little thing.
[33:21.71]Wait, is there a link already?
[33:24.91]There's a link already.
[33:28.75]No, you can't do the Kubrick stare again.
[33:30.73]With the hamburger.
[33:34.43]I guess you could.
[33:45.43]Let's take a look.
[33:51.98]Oh boy That is so creepy that is scary
[34:11.66]I need to, like, cough, because, like, anytime something goes up your nose and down the wrong pipe and just through your nose and shit, like, hold on.
[34:41.96]Oops, sorry.
[34:42.54]I didn't mean to do that.
[34:45.30]I'm so glad I got to do that, though.
[34:49.49]Alright, let's go.
[34:52.51]We still have hundreds of games that I haven't played.
[34:54.47]Probably not going to do this again, by the way.
[34:58.59]This will be the last time you see this console.
[35:03.88]He's taking a rip?
[35:05.72]No.
[35:05.98]Okay.
[35:11.14]Now really important.
[35:12.12]I need to delay the audio by a certain amount of time.
[35:15.28]You can test it for me to make sure it's working.
[35:21.47]Okay.
[35:21.95]So let's give you, let's give us a little test here.
[35:24.19]So ready?
[35:24.75]One, two, one, two, three, four.
[35:28.19]How are we doing?
[35:34.13]One, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four.
[35:37.93]Okay.
[35:39.95]Alright, let's go.
[35:42.59]Let's play... Where should we start?
[35:47.61]Where do we start today?
[35:53.60]Jungle Book?
[35:56.30]Licensed by Nintendo.
[35:59.42]Can you guys hear it?
[36:00.84]Probably not.
[36:04.71]Okay.
[36:05.65]Walt Disney Company.
[36:07.01]Press select for options.
[36:08.71]This is... I think this is just the game.
[36:09.89]Uh... Jungle of... Okay.
[36:16.99]Version... Get ready!
[36:21.45]Where... Oh.
[36:23.41]Is there a slide?
[36:24.08]Is this just the game?
[36:33.59]This is not bad.
[36:35.53]Purple.
[36:36.35]Purple background.
[36:37.02]Purple grapes.
[36:40.00]I thought I just bounced on like a spring.
[36:42.26]Hold down.
[36:51.89]He loves it.
[36:52.79]It's not bad.
[36:53.31]Wait, isn't the warthog...
[37:13.91]Bear necessities, those simple bear necessities will have a lot of fun when we are friends.
[37:23.36]I'm done.
[37:24.42]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[37:32.33]Um, how do I do this?
[37:43.93]Is it... Do we just hold the jump?
[37:45.55]Climb the vine.
[37:49.75]Where?
[37:49.99]This vine.
[37:57.94]Oh, I got it.
[37:58.36]Okay.
[37:59.32]This is a friend?
[38:00.95]Hey!
[38:01.37]He was, like, dancing!
[38:16.82]I feel like I'm playing this on a Game Boy Color.
[38:19.40]Is this a Game Boy game or is this a Nintendo game?
[38:21.12]Oh, wait.
[38:26.22]Okay, hold on.
[38:27.32]I can hold... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[38:31.91]That's... You can run.
[38:33.11]Here we go.
[38:38.23]Bounce.
[38:41.33]Okay, snake.
[38:44.05]Where can I go from here?
[38:44.86]Get the diamond.
[38:47.42]Time's up.
[38:47.92]It's not up.
[38:49.92]Holy shit.
[38:50.42]I got it.
[38:55.18]Time is not up yet.
[38:55.88]I need to get to the end of the Game Boy game.
[39:01.52]Time extended.
[39:04.34]Yeah.
[39:04.74]Time is a bit extended.
[39:08.53]You can jump on people too.
[39:09.33]Do they have Aladdin on here for Super Nintendo?
[39:12.31]Even though it's not the right console.
[39:15.75]And yup, the Super Nintendo Aladdin is better than the Genesis Aladdin.
[39:20.45]I'm done.
[39:20.65]Alright, what else we got?
[39:28.26]We did all these.
[39:29.14]These are all done.
[39:30.40]We got Ninja Turtles 1, Ninja Turtles 2, Ninja Turtles 1.
[39:37.62]The SNES sound card sucks.
[39:40.44]That's a fake comment.
[39:41.54]That's a troll.
[39:43.60]This is just the game.
[39:47.71]This is just, yeah, this is just the Ninja Turtles game for a regular Nintendo.
[39:54.32]I remember this.
[40:00.40]You actually do get games in this.
[40:01.83]Yeah, this is just the Ninja Turtles game.
[40:07.25]I remember this game being hard as shit when I was younger.
[40:16.31]You suck at it.
[40:17.42]Yeah, whatever.
[40:18.00]Okay.
[40:21.98]This game's ass?
[40:30.70]It's got great music, though.
[40:33.28]I love the overworld music.
[40:34.32]It's the best.
[40:40.21]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[40:40.71]The swimming level.
[40:41.53]I forgot about the swimming level.
[40:43.15]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[40:46.93]oh get back up uh I gotta go up that across that way I gotta eat the pizza yeah this full pizza this slices pizza if somebody dies don't you please the other characters do
[41:11.73]It's wicked cool.
[41:16.29]Oh, here we go.
[41:16.73]Here's Bebop and Rocksteady.
[41:24.68]It's Flinter down there.
[41:29.48]That image is Flinter.
[41:30.48]That is a great Steam profile picture.
[41:37.33]Uh, Michelangelo's my favorite.
[41:38.49]Because he was the funny one.
[41:42.97]I connect with him the most because he has the lowest vocabulary.
[41:52.33]And he has the incredibly good talent of being able to use nunchucks without accidentally hitting himself in the balls like I have done a hundred times.
[41:57.77]He has the lowest IQ.
[42:08.59]Hey, give us back April!
[42:16.69]Uh, where should I go?
[42:21.14]You know, when I was younger, I don't know why, I thought this was his tongue.
[42:26.88]I thought he was going like, bleh, bleh, bleh, like a snake.
[42:32.11]Oh, let's go in here.
[42:32.55]Can't.
[42:38.71]What are the two now?
[42:39.90]Alright, this one.
[42:40.58]Okay, here we go.
[42:41.22]Eight's up.
[42:50.12]I see why you relate to him now.
[42:56.67]Why?
[42:56.93]Don't kill me.
[43:02.59]I'll kill you first.
[43:06.05]Nobody said that.
[43:06.61]Yes, they did.
[43:07.03]Why would I have read that?
[43:08.69]Alright, don't die.
[43:09.45]Well, who cares if I die?
[43:10.41]I'm over.
[43:11.30]It's over.
[43:11.56]Alright, now I'm going to see what Ninja Turtles 2 is.
[43:17.25]Why does he read chat?
[43:19.33]Uh, why wouldn't I?
[43:20.71]Alright, this is Ninja Turtles 2.
[43:24.59]Ultra games is... Wait, what?
[43:29.39]No way.
[43:31.02]No way!
[43:31.50]This is like the best game ever made!
[43:33.52]This game is incredible.
[43:34.66]This is the original arcade version?
[43:36.60]Holy shit.
[43:39.62]Are you serious?
[43:44.40]It is?! !
[43:46.41]This game is awesome.
[43:53.70]Yeah, that's right.
[43:54.34]The fi- Oh my god.
[43:55.40]Okay, I'm going to play the hell out of this.
[43:56.52]Holy shit.
[44:01.40]Yeah.
[44:02.16]Forget everything else I planned on doing today.
[44:03.86]I at least want to get to the first boss.
[44:08.68]I love this game.
[44:09.38]I used to play this all the time.
[44:17.35]We have this arcade game on my college campus.
[44:19.51]Well, yeah, that sounds like a pretty awesome college campus to me.
[44:30.12]Turtles in Time.
[44:30.88]I have beaten Turtles in Time.
[44:33.14]I would... I'm going to be realistic with you.
[44:34.88]I've probably completed that game 1 to 200 times.
[44:44.81]That game is so good.
[44:47.82]Liar?
[44:48.22]No, no, not lying.
[44:49.34]No, I'm not.
[44:50.26]Friends and I used to sit there.
[44:51.38]We would rent it.
[44:52.96]And we would beat the game like five or six times a day.
[44:56.14]Until we were forced to return it to Blockbuster.
[45:09.07]Okay, so one to two hundred times.
[45:10.41]Yeah.
[45:12.49]Yes.
[45:13.83]Very much yes.
[45:14.57]Is this a Pizza Hut?
[45:21.39]So you beat it two times.
[45:22.84]No, 200!
[45:29.20]I remember my favorite part about these old beat-em-up games, especially the Ninja Turtle games, is when they're blinking, that means they're almost dead.
[45:37.84]I think we did that back.
[45:41.90]Back before health bars were over every enemy, when they started blinking, it means they were close.
[45:47.62]They should start doing that with WoW raid bosses and shit.
[45:49.84]Get these health bars with like 10 million HP on them.
[45:52.77]No.
[45:54.25]Is he blinking?
[45:57.55]He's blinking.
[45:58.25]He's almost done.
[45:59.21]Up the DPS.
[45:59.75]Let's go.
[46:01.04]Ow.
[46:09.68]Pizza Hut.
[46:16.75]Oh, come on.
[46:17.41]Don't die.
[46:17.91]I need to get the... Look, it's arcade version.
[46:19.57]I'm supposed to have like three people here.
[46:20.73]I love the X-Men arcade game too.
[46:24.33]And I know I've done the Colossus like a thousand times, but every time I bring it up, I'm going to do the Colossus sound.
[46:28.85]You know that, right?
[46:37.94]Shit.
[46:42.51]Worst noise incoming.
[46:43.41]No, that's not... I'm going to... Listen to this.
[46:46.15]You cannot nominate something for an award if it's been done a bunch of times before and you didn't nominate it before.
[46:53.86]Like years ago, you had a chance to nominate this.
[46:56.02]No, it was never on the nomination list.
[47:08.59]Can't nominate it.
[47:09.33]I've done it like a thousand times.
[47:23.41]Sorting algorithm.
[47:24.75]Alright, who's the first boss?
[47:27.48]It's the blob.
[47:28.14]That's the X-Men game.
[47:30.28]It actually is the blob in the X-Men game.
[47:36.84]Swallow your spit.
[47:38.66]I did what?
[47:50.53]Why did I read that?
[47:51.29]I don't know.
[47:51.77]Why did I read it?
[47:52.35]Here comes the blob.
[47:56.42]Nothing can stop the floor.
[47:58.48]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[47:59.38]You can start hitting him before we stop talking.
[48:02.64]Nothing can stop the floor.
[48:04.14]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[48:18.97]Who is it?
[48:19.33]I forget.
[48:20.11]Is it Bebop and Rocksteady or is that later?
[48:26.58]Get over here, you little shit.
[48:29.32]It is.
[48:32.40]What's that?
[48:32.80]Am I getting infinite continues on the bootleg Nintendo?
[48:45.19]Oh, these are flamethrower troops.
[48:46.23]Here we go.
[48:53.45]I forget who it is.
[48:57.79]Oh, it's Bebop.
[49:05.73]Yep.
[49:06.45]Oh, I love it.
[49:07.71]I love that sound.
[49:14.13]Excuse me, can I get a he's blinking alert when he starts blinking?
[49:16.76]Because I'm going to need some help here.
[49:19.94]Sorry.
[49:35.27]Here it is.
[49:35.93]He's blinking.
[49:43.34]Fuck.
[49:47.20]Don't let him win.
[49:53.44]Up the DPS quick.
[49:54.50]Up the DPS.
[49:55.06]He's almost done.
[49:58.75]Got it.
[50:06.60]That's from Turtles in Time.
[50:10.86]Come on, after that Shredder creep.
[50:16.90]Turtles in Time had the best music too.
[50:23.42]That first level in Turtles in Time.
[50:27.36]Big Apple.
[50:29.16]It's the best.
[50:35.52]You know, back when video game music was good.
[50:38.10]Back when OSTs were good.
[50:40.62]And there was passion in them.
[50:50.55]Sing the entire Ninja Turtles theme song perfectly.
[50:54.67]What?
[50:54.89]Funny that they're on national television doing this.
[51:04.51]He's like camera shy.
[51:07.23]April O'Neil was just on there going, help, help.
[51:09.95]And then it cuts to him.
[51:10.71]It's like, Shredder.
[51:12.46]You're wrong.
[51:12.78]There's this camera guy like pointing at him going like, Shredder, Shredder.
[51:15.44]You're pointing.
[51:17.06]Come on.
[51:18.30]He's just frozen.
[51:20.52]So nervous.
[51:27.60]Ah, yes, yes, it's real.
[51:30.16]You're all doomed to die.
[51:31.40]So you're gonna get killed.
[51:32.28]Okay, cut it.
[51:35.48]And his face is starting to get bright fucking red.
[51:39.47]He had this elaborate thing he practiced in the mirror for like three days straight.
[51:42.99]And it did not sound like that.
[51:44.11]It was way cooler.
[51:49.33]And then he like ran off.
[51:50.45]He like runs off backstage with his hands in his face going like...
[52:11.72]of projecting.
[52:17.84]What?
[52:18.08]You think I've never, when I was younger, got all the lines I was going to do in an old school play?
[52:26.18]Those of you that have never had the experience of being on a stage in a school play and forgetting your lines while just silence surrounds you and all the other kids on stage are looking around and staring at you.
[52:41.77]Like, oh God, you are ruining the entire play.
[52:47.10]Dude.
[52:48.14]And you're sitting there like, I don't know.
[52:55.38]I never cried and ran off stage though.
[52:58.02]Did forget.
[53:00.80]And then when you fuck up and you start saying a line that's wrong.
[53:06.08]Guys, here's something you need to know about drama.
[53:08.18]About theater.
[53:09.60]Back in, like, middle school.
[53:11.70]We, all of us, just memorized the last person's last sentence to cue us for our sentence.
[53:17.91]So, if you do not give me the exact sentence that I've memorized, I am not going to be able to remember anything I'm supposed to say.
[53:26.47]It's an incredibly fragile chain of events where we all have to memorize the last thing that the last person said.
[53:34.81]And it's an extremely volatile environment, because if one person doesn't fucking remember, everyone doesn't remember.
[53:45.74]And then the curtain has to close and you skip a whole scene.
[53:49.48]And then the audience just starts going like... Clap, okay, and here we are at the next scene.
[54:06.45]This is all- it's all everybody's parents.
[54:14.33]I can still feel that sauce.
[54:30.12]Oh, we're living the old- the golden- the olden days.
[54:43.23]Wait, I remember this is the Robo-Turtle, right?
[54:45.79]Because they remade it for Turtles in Time.
[54:48.81]I believe that's who it is.
[54:55.67]Let's look at the lore with the Robo-Turtle.
[54:57.17]He was bad, right?
[54:58.77]And then Donatello reprogrammed him and made him a good guy.
[55:01.60]And then after he was bad, he turned into a good turtle, right?
[55:06.28]Oh, it's wrong.
[55:12.94]That happens, right?
[55:14.46]Oh.
[55:18.48]That's a fake fan.
[55:20.66]Oh, I got continues.
[55:21.30]We're good.
[55:21.56]No, I don't want to do that again.
[55:23.35]I love this game, though.
[55:28.45]Acting challenge.
[55:29.13]Raphael eating a sloppy burger.
[55:30.75]I mean, I already did it.
[55:39.42]Raphael has a New York accent.
[55:40.86]I'm from Boston, close enough.
[55:42.32]And I just ate a gross cold Whopper.
[55:46.36]And I think I was like, oh, what the fuck, dude?
[55:49.45]I just did that.
[55:50.45]So, no.
[55:55.95]Where's Ninja Turtles 3?
[55:56.53]There it is.
[56:04.66]Which one is this?
[56:09.06]Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in a half shell, Dirtle Bower.
[56:23.83]They're the world's most fearsome fighting team.
[56:28.85]Close enough.
[56:29.23]Cowabunga!
[56:35.01]I like all the turtles.
[56:36.33]I love them all.
[56:37.67]Michelangelo's my favorite.
[56:39.64]But I'm not against playing as Raphael either.
[56:47.10]The turtles are enjoying their vacation on a beach in Florida.
[56:54.27]When suddenly... Come on, April's report is just about to start.
[57:01.67]Is that a glass of wine?
[57:06.29]Here in New York, crime is escalating every day.
[57:10.06]Wait, we went on vacation?
[57:13.00]Gee, what happened?
[57:18.16]Bummer, dudes.
[57:19.54]It's me, Shredder.
[57:23.40]I'm stealing all of New York City.
[57:26.32]The whole thing.
[57:28.64]What?
[57:29.04]Wouldn't we know that was... Turtles, I'm taking April along with Manhattan Island.
[57:36.14]uh if you want them back come and get them I love how Manhattan island is like tacked on to I'm taking April again yes I'm taking April and the entire all of New York city too I guess but I got April
[58:07.09]I don't remember this game.
[58:12.21]He took it all.
[58:16.38]How?
[58:20.34]Is the Shredder kind of like a reverse Batman?
[58:22.32]Is he like a trillionaire or something?
[58:26.00]I feel like he kind of has to be.
[58:27.34]He always has to do like experiments and has like all these new things made and tons of money going into stuff.
[58:38.05]He has an entire research facility.
[58:45.81]The Joker laughs and has a gun that has a fake POW on it.
[58:51.63]And tries to stab people.
[58:54.58]And he has all this control, yet the Shredder has a whole research facility dedicated to creating new animals.
[59:04.30]Shredder is probably, like, one of the most powerful villains, I think, in all of, like, comic books and stuff, isn't he?
[59:08.51]He has to be.
[59:15.53]Who's more powerful than the Shredder?
[59:17.57]In regards to, like, how much money they have and how much, like, stuff that they've developed.
[59:22.03]This motherfucker made a Death Star.
[59:24.39]Shredder made a Death Star.
[59:26.29]The Technodrome.
[59:39.06]Yeah, okay, in the grand scheme of things, okay, like Bowser... Mario, I'm going to take Princess Peach on my flying pirate ship.
[59:50.13]And I have a bunch of little shit kids.
[59:54.57]Ah, I'm so powerful.
[59:55.77]No, you're just a fucking weird uncle.
[59:59.85]The Shredder has, like, fucking laser beams and a research facility and thousands and thousands and thousands of projects and hundreds of billions of dollars worth of shit.
[60:16.24]Bowser has an army of little Goomba people.
[60:21.52]When you step on their heads, they die instantly.
[60:28.11]Look at these guys.
[60:28.65]These guys are like trained professional ninjas.
[60:33.13]Are you telling me that these guys are less powerful than a Goomba and a Koopa?
[60:47.57]Goombas wouldn't be able to pull that off.
[60:54.60]People turn into... Wait, what?
[60:59.84]Shredder is Doctor Doom.
[61:04.36]Shredder is just Doctor Doom.
[61:07.86]No, that's not accurate.
[61:08.70]Shredder is incredibly powerful.
[61:10.68]Like, he's got, like, skills.
[61:12.02]Like, fighting skills.
[61:14.50]Dr. Doom just injected syrup into his fucking butt cheek or something, right?
[61:19.37]He's not a trained martial artist like Shredder is.
[61:29.24]You put Shredder against Dr. Doom, Shredder wins every time.
[61:45.86]wrong gonna have to settle this in the next rumble shredder incorrect I think shredder is one of the most powerful villains he just has everything he's got the okay he's got like the wolverine claws he's arguably potentially even more trained than wolverine was
[62:29.02]Somebody said, NA aim.
[62:31.80]He's just aiming into the sky.
[62:33.34]He gets beaten by four super mutant turtles.
[62:43.70]Yeah, at the same time.
[62:53.09]When have they... I'm sorry, has there ever been a scenario where the Shredder fights Leonardo by himself and loses?
[62:59.31]That's not happened.
[62:59.93]They all gang up on him together at the same time, and they beat him.
[63:07.94]In the comics, yeah.
[63:08.78]Yeah, he probably was already injured, though.
[63:09.82]He was already injured.
[63:13.48]Raphael, like, shot him in the chest with a crossbow, and, like, Leonardo fought him one-on-one.
[63:17.36]Not fair.
[63:30.31]I keep jumping into this fucking fire.
[63:32.75]He's coping.
[63:44.94]Shredder, whatever.
[63:46.60]Shredder's stand.
[63:51.81]How did you do this this quickly?
[63:53.11]Holy shit.
[63:54.67]This was fast.
[63:56.51]Very fast.
[64:09.00]That's good shit.
[64:16.94]If you like Shredder so much, why don't you marry him?
[64:19.83]Shredder's already taken.
[64:31.73]I don't know.
[64:32.41]I don't know, man.
[64:33.65]I would love if there was a shredder and a shredette.
[64:37.95]Oh, yeah.
[64:38.35]That would be fucking awesome.
[64:39.21]I would love that.
[64:40.87]Include it.
[64:41.73]I want it.
[64:51.66]What the fuck?
[64:52.52]Look at that synchronized move.
[64:53.78]Oh, the goombas can do this, Jeremy.
[64:55.16]Look at how the goombas can do that.
[64:57.78]Oh, yeah.
[64:58.10]They could.
[64:58.66]They could do this.
[64:59.10]Yeah.
[64:59.66]Yeah.
[65:02.00]There are only two species on Earth that can do that.
[65:04.40]The Foot Clan and birds.
[65:07.41]And some birds can't even do that.
[65:08.55]So, sorry.
[65:09.39]You lost that argument.
[65:10.15]This is going so slow.
[65:19.48]This is lagging so hard.
[65:20.44]I can't even... What about dolphins?
[65:26.64]Let's be honest though.
[65:27.26]Dolphins are pretty much just birds under the water.
[65:46.08]yeah um everyone think I'm crazy why don't you look it up go ahead look it up are dolphins the birds of the ocean sure Jerm is the Jerm is the crazy one right did you go to shredder's wedding uh I was in the wedding I was in the wedding party so
[66:23.64]You guys think that, like, 40 years from now, you think, like, the Ninja Turtles would be at Shredder's, like, son's wedding or daughter's wedding or something?
[66:31.27]And they look great old and wrinkly and shit?
[66:34.29]Clapping and just in the audience?
[66:39.07]I think so.
[66:46.44]Shit.
[66:52.84]They're turtles.
[66:55.05]Yeah, turtles live to be like 150.
[66:56.03]We don't think they'll be alive.
[66:58.91]I'm I'm confused.
[67:16.64]Try is going to still be in his armor at the wedding.
[67:26.75]Maybe.
[67:27.03]That shot me right in the face.
[67:31.31]I just want to see the next boss and then I'm going to move on.
[67:42.66]Most turtles live to be 20 to 30.
[67:43.68]Um, yeah, but they had like radioactive goop put on them.
[67:49.08]That probably increases their life by a little bit.
[67:50.90]They have like superpowers and they're radioactive.
[67:55.66]Like, right?
[67:57.80]They have extra powers.
[67:58.72]They're gaslighting you.
[68:08.61]Oh, okay.
[68:11.21]Thanks for the tip.
[68:12.01]Thanks for the help.
[68:12.87]Appreciate it.
[68:13.39]Thank you.
[68:13.69]Three, four, five, jump.
[68:20.51]Oh.
[68:24.44]three four five jump one two three four five jump I will say about the I was almost at Simpsons the ninja turtles really have surprisingly stuck around for a very long time the ninja turtles are still cool right tell younger kids
[68:54.06]They still are, yeah.
[68:56.14]That's great.
[68:56.54]That's cool.
[68:58.10]It's cool that something could still be around and not be tired, I guess.
[69:02.98]The kids love the Ninja Turtles still.
[69:05.26]25 years later.
[69:08.60]Everyone's saying no.
[69:15.29]Am I just... What do you mean?
[69:16.63]They don't?
[69:19.69]Absolutely not.
[69:21.48]Really?
[69:21.72]Don't they have like a new TV show and a new line of toys and stuff?
[69:25.73]I thought that there was a whole new thing with them.
[69:38.97]Peppa Pig is... Peppa Pig is for like two-year-olds.
[69:42.26]I'm talking about like 10 to 14-year-olds.
[69:53.07]A two-year-old does not watch the Ninja Turtles.
[69:55.17]Maybe, like, once you cross, like, five, six, seven, eight.
[69:58.88]That's probably what I would say.
[69:59.60]Like, okay, you're starting to get interested.
[70:00.86]I don't know who this is.
[70:06.06]What character is this?
[70:06.72]Holy fucking shit.
[70:19.39]Oh, God.
[70:24.95]It's Peppa Pig.
[70:27.89]Oh, shit!
[70:29.57]Environmental attacks!
[70:34.66]Ow!
[70:36.52]What?
[70:43.67]He still has it.
[70:44.57]Come on.
[70:44.89]Let's wait till he charges.
[70:46.43]One, two, three.
[70:58.76]Stop.
[71:02.49]Stop.
[71:05.09]Charge.
[71:06.83]Stop.
[71:08.97]Charge.
[71:10.55]Stop.
[71:12.58]Charge.
[71:21.08]It's not blinking yet.
[71:22.00]Stop saying it.
[71:38.99]One, two, three, watch out!
[71:42.82]Dr. Doom, oh, Dr. Doom, Dr. Doom, that's it, Dr. Doom, that's it.
[71:45.76]Oh, Dr. Doom, that's it.
[71:46.80]Dr. Doom is the greatest.
[71:47.76]He's so, so strong.
[71:48.44]He has his special powers.
[71:49.38]He has his special powers.
[71:53.96]I just dropped my fucking goddamn mouse on the ground because of this.
[71:56.78]Hold on.
[71:59.54]What does Dr. Doom do?
[72:00.62]Tell me.
[72:02.89]I mean, hold on a second.
[72:07.93]fucking goddamn whopper sauce in my nose.
[72:10.71]Dr. Doom owns a country, meaning he has significant political power.
[72:16.64]He's got magic powers on top of superhuman strength and has amassed a robot army with a superior intellect.
[72:23.02]All Shredder has is claws and a rent a ninja he hired with ham sandwiches.
[72:28.40]Shredder is a bug to Dr. Doom.
[72:30.31]Okay.
[72:35.99]That's something that
[72:38.83]I just fell off.
[72:41.57]Debug to Dr. Doom.
[72:42.75]Let me ask you another follow-up question, though.
[72:47.65]Do you really care?
[72:57.97]Yes, I do.
[72:58.67]Well, so do I, alright?
[73:01.77]I was trying to pretend like I didn't.
[73:03.07]Dr. Doom's got nothing on this shredder.
[73:18.15]Yeah.
[73:20.81]Oh, could Doctor Doom do that?
[73:31.00]He said Doctor Doom owns a country or something?
[73:36.29]Can he float the entire country?
[73:39.59]You said he has magical powers, but how is Shredder doing that?
[73:48.27]Probably.
[73:48.61]I don't think so.
[73:55.86]He has renter ninjas?
[73:57.60]This is actually kind of brutal.
[74:19.98]Yep, I knew it was coming.
[74:32.34]My favorite thing about the little Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is how every word throws you a new curveball.
[74:38.04]Like teenage.
[74:38.74]Solid starting point.
[74:39.92]Popular protagonist demographic.
[74:41.48]I can understand that.
[74:42.20]Suddenly hard left into mutant.
[74:44.12]And oh shit, that's wild.
[74:45.14]We are going to X-Men territory.
[74:46.97]How are they going to play this?
[74:47.79]Let's wait.
[74:48.47]And ninjas?
[74:49.81]Yo, this can't possibly get cooler.
[74:51.37]Ninjas are wild, right?
[74:53.21]And then suddenly they end with turtles.
[74:54.31]And your hopes and dreams don't know what to do.
[74:56.07]Um.
[75:04.23]This crumbs all over my keyboard.
[75:05.83]I have to clean up later.
[75:06.57]It's Redditor spam.
[75:13.71]I forgot this game is before 1995.
[75:17.07]Doing the special move hurts you.
[75:25.88]But you can do the special move a million times at 0% health.
[75:33.87]Shreditor.
[75:35.61]I knew it was coming.
[75:36.32]I wasn't going to say it.
[75:37.00]He's getting hit by a car?
[75:40.98]Okay, that's it.
[75:47.04]And the Ninja Turtles are cooler than Doctor Doom.
[75:51.55]Because we've got our own Yoda here.
[75:55.63]We got Splinter.
[75:56.53]Splinter's like a kind of a cool... I mean, Yoda's cool, but Splinter's really cool, too.
[76:02.03]Ninja Toodles?
[76:08.72]Okay, you want to play this game?
[76:10.46]Name me the last Fantastic Four piece of media that had higher than a 2 across, like, Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes and stuff.
[76:23.58]How does that sound?
[76:28.47]I think the Shredder wins.
[76:39.42]What's next?
[76:39.82]Where are we going now?
[76:40.66]How about Three Eyes Boy?
[76:43.50]By Tommy.
[76:47.54]That is a point for the Shredder.
[76:48.38]That means he's well-written.
[76:51.79]He's directed much better.
[76:53.87]He may be acted much better.
[76:55.17]He may be written better than Fantas- Yeah, that's a point.
[77:11.18]Free eyes, boy.
[77:14.64]This is Binding of Isaac.
[77:19.74]Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[77:32.00]What is it? Cuphead. This one is kinda fun.
[77:42.00]What is TN? TN... TN? What's TN?
[77:55.02]I don't know.
[77:55.40]I don't know what TN is.
[78:01.77]Why am I killing all the neighborhood animals?
[78:03.41]What am I doing?
[78:05.63]These hurt?
[78:06.17]Yeah, they hurt.
[78:06.87]What?
[78:07.27]Air shot.
[78:10.11]Next game.
[78:20.72]Hold on, wait, I can't, we gotta give it at least like a minute or two.
[78:23.90]We can't just leave immediately.
[78:25.56]Okay, what, why am I doing this?
[78:32.57]I hitched a ride on the back of a truck and just started shooting all the, like, dogs.
[78:41.73]This game's fun.
[78:44.50]This game's like challenging and fun and stuff.
[78:47.32]It's probably a real game.
[78:55.99]Uh, okay.
[78:58.77]Health pack?
[79:00.39]A baby dragon or something and an egg?
[79:03.14]An extra health?
[79:06.40]Oh, this really is.
[79:07.74]This is cool.
[79:08.38]Alright, I need health.
[79:15.63]Smoking is cool, kids.
[79:16.83]Why are you saying that?
[79:18.21]It's not.
[79:19.69]It's not cool.
[79:40.98]I'm confused of the enemy types here.
[79:45.78]Usually they fall like a certain theme, but it's like a bunch of just happy looking dogs mixed in with like, it's like totem pole.
[79:55.80]I don't understand.
[79:56.24]What's the, what am I fighting here?
[79:57.38]What's the goal?
[80:05.17]Okay.
[80:20.34]Can I not jump up this?
[80:23.86]Why would this be this high?
[80:30.40]I can't jump up here either.
[80:31.62]I have to go down the holes.
[80:36.22]I don't think that's what you do.
[80:37.00]Can I climb this?
[80:48.25]Next.
[80:55.56]Journalist.
[80:56.78]Stop.
[80:58.06]Alright, how about, uh... Hmm.
[81:02.81]Hmm.
[81:03.73]How about Mighty Final Fight?
[81:06.35]The stories start.
[81:09.03]Right now.
[81:11.39]Definitely not Capcom Presents.
[81:14.57]This is Metro City.
[81:16.17]This is Metro City.
[81:17.73]Within the walls of the city, the daughter of the mayor, Jessica, her beauty, ratty, hates throughout the city and gives the citizens the power to survive.
[81:32.24]And to survive, all you have to do is not get caught.
[81:36.42]This beacon of light all to himself.
[81:46.09]With the girl, she will be mine.
[81:47.67]What?
[81:51.09]A couple days later.
[81:56.06]What?
[81:56.60]Jessica?
[81:57.28]Kidnapped?
[82:00.26]What have you done to her, Cody?
[82:01.78]Me?
[82:06.08]This is the work of the Mad Gear Gang.
[82:10.71]What do you think, guy?
[82:15.25]This is not a moment to spare.
[82:16.55]Let's go.
[82:20.75]Mighty Final Fight.
[82:23.92]Cody, a tough Street Fighter who is skilled with knives.
[82:28.24]Guy, descended from ninja.
[82:31.16]He possesses incredible agility.
[82:33.44]And... I thought... I thought it said Hagrid.
[82:39.04]And Hagrid, the hot-tempered wrestler and mayor of Metro City.
[82:48.23]uh this is the guy that you hold your arms out and you go you spin old town slum was that Australia this is definitely not final fight by the way this is a this is a figurine pop version that's kind of fun though
[83:23.19]This feels like an arcade game inside of a game that wants you to very clearly see that there are fun arcade cabinets to play in the game.
[83:40.73]It's the same background for Contra.
[83:43.27]Yeah, it is.
[83:43.95]It's the exact same one.
[83:46.79]Auto Hotel is back.
[83:56.61]That swallowing that shit made me, like, puke.
[84:03.05]Except we lost some real estate up top.
[84:04.73]We can't see Auto Hotel.
[84:07.46]This is a real NES game.
[84:10.44]How come this experience points?
[84:14.12]How do I do the spin move?
[84:15.02]There it is.
[84:15.36]Is this a cape?
[84:32.18]His smile is so creepy.
[84:37.27]Those eyes, holy shit.
[84:41.19]I'm going up.
[84:43.59]Movie.
[84:44.57]Now open.
[84:47.18]A movie.
[84:48.94]Of some kind.
[84:55.78]Statue of Liberty.
[85:05.21]Uh-oh.
[85:06.25]Other guy with big head.
[85:10.47]Other player.
[85:12.65]This feels like a second player.
[85:22.92]Good, Link.
[85:23.64]Oh, shit.
[85:24.10]I'm dead.
[85:25.36]I can come back, though.
[85:25.98]I'm good.
[85:31.55]God damn it.
[85:38.94]When I beat the boss, I'll click the link.
[85:40.65]Hold on.
[85:43.99]What the fuck?
[85:44.81]He just stunlocked me.
[85:51.39]Stunlock.
[85:51.73]1, 2, 3, 4, 5 seconds.
[85:54.55]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.
[85:55.98]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.
[86:01.38]You guys ever do that in your head?
[86:02.16]When you play Beat Em Up?
[86:04.28]You just repeat the same, like, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[86:07.78]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[86:10.14]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[86:13.70]I am Thrasher, ruler of this city.
[86:17.26]Bow down before me.
[86:18.88]Uh, yes.
[86:23.12]I am superior.
[86:24.38]Maybe you're stronger than you look.
[86:26.96]Why don't you join us?
[86:29.60]Uh...
[86:31.99]Yes.
[86:34.26]I don't believe you.
[86:35.22]You're too much of a mama's boy.
[86:45.04]He's doing the big brother thing.
[86:47.04]He's just rubbing my head like, come on, little brother.
[86:49.45]Oh, mama's boy, mama's boy, mama's boy.
[86:53.79]Stop.
[86:54.15]Stop saying that.
[86:55.69]Get out of here.
[86:57.15]Get away from me, dude.
[87:01.39]Bye, big boy.
[87:05.39]I can't even hit him.
[87:17.68]Stunlock.
[87:24.10]Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[87:30.95]What is that?
[87:32.33]Come on, let me get the... Fine, I'll do what you're doing.
[87:47.00]Hurry up, I need to watch.
[87:56.72]Do what you want to do.
[88:04.41]Got it.
[88:04.65]We're going to Riverside.
[88:16.12]Keef, out.
[88:23.24]Ah, purple.
[88:26.23]Purple.
[88:28.91]My favorite color.
[88:31.11]Purple.
[88:32.09]Alright, let me click the link.
[88:33.47]I know, I said I promised.
[88:34.59]Just wait a minute.
[88:37.75]Most popular kids characters.
[88:51.38]Fortnite is Bugs Bunny.
[88:56.76]Doctor Doom is...
[88:59.80]This is not like... Alright, thank you.
[89:22.91]All caps, all caps, all caps.
[89:27.18]My link is better, my link is better.
[89:30.28]I just Jerma suplexed that lady.
[89:35.36]I just Jerma suplexed?
[89:37.49]I added an ED on there.
[89:38.51]I don't know why.
[89:39.59]Instead of just saying suplexed.
[89:41.27]Like T. Stop!
[89:52.43]Why is Jerma chat always all caps?
[89:54.79]Because everyone is constantly yelling.
[89:59.52]Everyone's constantly screaming.
[90:08.83]Oh, it's Jax.
[90:12.53]That guy, is he holding up like a football like Charlie Brown?
[90:15.39]Is Lucy gonna come over and kick that?
[90:19.99]Who's he holding that for?
[90:20.87]Okay, here we go.
[90:30.37]Here I come.
[90:31.11]I'm gonna, I'm gonna get that football.
[90:38.24]You dope Charlie Brown.
[90:40.60]Why?
[90:41.06]He doesn't need to like a curve of the frog thing.
[90:43.94]He goes like, ah, like Peewee Herman.
[90:49.00]What's the Charlie Brown yell?
[90:49.93]It's something like that, isn't it?
[90:50.77]It's like Peewee Herman.
[90:58.31]That's the worst Charlie Brown voice I've ever heard.
[90:59.89]I'm not trying to do it.
[91:00.83]I'm just... I'm asking about the cadences.
[91:02.51]I'm not talking about doing a voice.
[91:03.57]I'm talking about the cadences.
[91:06.25]Is it like... Ah!
[91:09.14]Lucy holds it.
[91:09.88]Yeah, that's what I said.
[91:10.42]Yeah, and he turns his head up and he has like an... He has an omega lull mouth.
[91:27.05]And it's like...
[91:45.08]Same guy.
[91:45.64]I kicked this guy's ass like five minutes ago.
[91:52.44]Best feeling when you get a dun dun dun dun dun dun on two or three people at the same time.
[92:11.89]The city in the background is melting.
[92:16.64]Oh no, who's throwing these barrels?
[92:18.04]It must be Cranky Kong.
[92:36.87]This is a long level.
[92:39.64]Yeah, how dare you?
[92:40.62]How dare you dress up in the same outfit as me?
[92:45.64]Holy shit!
[92:55.75]No!
[92:58.87]They're staring... There can only be like... 80 Darth Vader's walking around Comic-Con.
[93:06.67]81's too much!
[93:09.67]You're too fat and lazy to oppose me.
[93:14.64]You're no match for me.
[93:16.18]I am the Slam Master.
[93:20.50]Get out of my way before I stomp you flat.
[93:23.94]Are you done flapping those lips of yours?
[93:26.64]Good, because I'm gonna chop you down to size.
[93:30.08]You think you can mess with the Slam Master?
[93:42.74]I'm still alive.
[93:47.23]Okay, if you put graffiti on the ground, it just says fighter.
[93:52.67]Just fighter.
[93:55.67]Is it?
[93:58.30]Did he put that here to give me a finish line to cross so we fight?
[94:03.86]Fight.
[94:04.96]Fight here.
[94:06.30]But he didn't have enough room to write fight here with a space, so fight here.
[94:20.83]The crowd is split on that one.
[94:25.65]Ow!
[94:34.93]What's next?
[94:37.22]We could do Kickmaster.
[94:38.50]Did we do Kickmaster?
[94:39.38]I don't remember.
[94:45.37]There's one of the scummy... Oh, that's shaking around in my... There's one of the scummy living skeletons who attacked... You humans think you're a match for Belted?
[94:53.66]You can't even defeat me!
[94:57.86]Thornilin, wait!
[95:00.78]Look at that, like, nerd.
[95:01.96]Look at that, like, nerd neck.
[95:09.06]My brother, my steel is no match for these creatures.
[95:12.06]Only with your great kicking ability.
[95:13.92]Wait, what?
[95:16.52]Don't die.
[95:20.66]Save the princess.
[95:21.42]You're the last hope.
[95:25.77]You'll pay for this, Belzed.
[95:30.47]Your kicking ability.
[95:35.03]Oh, okay.
[95:35.53]Well, I think I got a pretty good kicking ability.
[95:39.08]I sure do.
[95:42.32]It's great.
[95:43.04]It's like the Rockettes.
[95:45.58]That's full range.
[96:03.86]I'm gonna go kill Belzed.
[96:08.78]Okay, if you didn't kick so high, you'd be able to hit them in the chest, therefore having a much larger hitbox.
[96:15.51]Kicking directly straight up in the air into the head gives me such a small range to hit anybody.
[96:22.93]Oh, Diablo II Paladin Scepter.
[96:24.45]Sorry, I have to do that every time somebody says that word.
[96:31.42]It's like you pulled the string on the back of the Woody doll.
[96:39.02]What is that?
[96:42.22]You have found the bouncing bulb spirit.
[96:44.20]This spirit will shoot bouncing balls to damage your enemies.
[96:47.54]Don't drop it.
[96:55.12]How do I do that?
[97:00.79]Okay, at some point, you just punch in the air, right?
[97:05.59]I get it, but it's very impractical to do that.
[97:17.25]Kill Belzed.
[97:18.03]Kill Belzed.
[97:18.75]I'm going to try.
[97:19.33]I'm trying to collect all the jewels.
[97:27.80]Kicking power.
[97:40.88]I have experience too.
[97:42.04]I'm interested in this one.
[97:43.28]We're going to stay here until I level up once.
[97:48.36]MP, huh?
[97:58.73]Seinfeld?
[97:59.43]Why am I Seinfeld streaming?
[98:01.05]Oh, watch out, boss.
[98:01.79]Is that Belzed?
[98:07.29]No, that's definitely one of Belzed's just chumps.
[98:20.15]It's a witch.
[98:22.05]Oh, watch out for the lightning.
[98:27.25]Shit, I'm going to die.
[98:28.77]No.
[98:31.92]It's that megalovania.
[98:33.88]That was just megalovania.
[98:35.72]Holy shit.
[98:36.38]What was that?
[98:36.82]Did you hear that?
[98:37.34]What the hell?
[98:43.35]I almost want to die again to hear that.
[98:53.68]shit that hit me really god damn it I hate the stupid kick to the side it sucked
[99:20.66]Come on.
[99:21.84]Come on.
[99:23.08]Come on.
[99:24.46]Got him.
[99:28.08]But I didn't pick it up.
[99:29.17]What did I get now?
[99:35.85]You have found the life up one magic.
[99:38.11]This magic will fill your life bar a little.
[99:40.25]A little.
[99:47.37]BT6G5, GGORC, Magic, Leaf, and Urn.
[100:01.00]Caverns of no return.
[100:09.29]Oh shit, what's this?
[100:12.07]Oh!
[100:14.93]Does it work?
[100:17.32]The orb's not shooting at anything.
[100:24.30]It's just a Warcraft pet.
[100:25.60]Doesn't do anything.
[100:26.22]Alright, here comes Megalovania.
[100:31.97]Here it comes.
[100:50.50]It's maybe one or two notes off.
[100:52.10]That's the I want to avoid the copyright, so I changed to notes version.
[101:07.91]Man, this game came out in the 90s.
[101:10.65]Oh, my God.
[101:11.17]Can you guys believe that?
[101:12.02]This game came out in the 90s.
[101:22.40]I got some super frogs.
[101:27.18]I'm supposed to be up in the 90s.
[101:28.26]20,000 upvotes.
[101:54.28]These guys are terrible.
[102:00.26]Play Melee?
[102:01.34]Like Smash Bros.
[102:02.18]Melee?
[102:11.75]Yes.
[102:13.55]I'm not very good at Smash Bros.
[102:14.61]Melee.
[102:15.21]I'm good at the one that... I'm good at Smash Bros.
[102:17.39]Brawl.
[102:17.77]A game where you can accidentally fall down.
[102:26.83]Can I go up?
[102:29.84]I can't go up.
[102:33.80]But I guess I can.
[102:34.40]This reminds me of Battletoads.
[102:38.20]This part right here.
[102:39.12]This exact section right now.

[104:13.98]What does this want me to do?
[104:24.30]Hello?
[104:25.50]It's a password?
[104:31.99]Solve the puzzle.
[104:32.77]This is a password screen.
[104:34.09]How did I get to a password screen?
[104:35.31]I just pressed start.
[104:37.37]Hold on.
[104:43.47]Was I called saint?
[104:50.51]Okay.
[104:52.95]Start.

[105:39.04]What?
[105:39.22]Okay, Cosmo and Life are different stats.

[105:57.33]I am not getting points for that.

[107:07.45]Bad choice.
[107:08.17]I don't have an indicator.

[108:11.11]What just happened?
[108:21.78]Is this the same?
[108:30.00]Elevator action waiting room.
[108:31.24]Alright, alright, alright.
[108:34.74]Where is it?
[108:36.72]Elevator action.
[108:39.61]I'll find it.

[108:44.13]Elevator.
[108:44.69]Aiu.
[108:49.45]Action.
[108:50.35]Action.
[109:01.83]Is this supposed to be me?
[109:05.95]Why am I Indiana Jones-ing into an apartment building?
[109:14.27]I just saw the guy in the head.
[109:18.21]What the fuck?
[109:20.49]Um, do I go in the... Are they going to get in the elevator?
[109:26.78]They're getting in the elevator.
[109:30.58]They're getting it...
[109:35.25]Don't shoot me.
[109:38.35]He got me.
[109:39.01]Fuck.
[109:45.21]What's the goal?
[109:47.40]Just get all the way to the bottom?
[109:48.62]Oh, wait.
[109:50.22]I can control the elevator.
[109:54.98]Imagine being able to do this in an actual elevator.
[109:57.28]Somebody hits the down button and you can just go up and down yourself and not have to open it.
[110:03.70]I'd say, like, hey, hey, meet me downstairs to somebody.
[110:06.14]Oh, take the stairs.
[110:07.08]And I just wouldn't show up.
[110:11.82]I would make them find me on the middle floor, like, open the doors and be like, hey, dickhead!
[110:15.67]And then close it and keep going down and keep going up.
[110:17.43]I don't think... Who shot me?
[110:33.88]I just took the lights out.
[110:34.66]How do I get... Wait, I gotta go in that orange door.
[110:45.85]Go in the door.
[110:52.09]Wait, stairs.
[110:52.63]Ah!
[110:52.69]Stairs.
[111:01.78]Stairs.
[111:03.83]Go down the stairs.
[111:12.02]Stairs.
[111:12.58]Go down the stairs.
[111:13.36]Go back up the stairs.
[111:22.91]Down.
[111:26.73]Oh, shit.

[111:29.25]Where am I?
[111:31.45]See that shit?
[111:32.21]That's called a duck.
[111:43.11]Getting down to the bottom.
[111:49.40]Oh, this is gonna be tricky.
[111:50.16]Ooh!
[111:54.00]No, no, down, down, down, down, down, down!
[112:07.67]Shit.
[112:08.05]Oh, man.
[112:19.48]Oh, shit.

[112:31.50]Wars.
[112:39.49]The tournament?
[112:41.09]I'm the penguin.
[112:44.25]Like dodgeball?
[112:49.85]What are you?
[112:50.91]Did I already die lost?
[112:53.77]Did I get him?
[113:04.60]Just stunlock him.
[113:05.28]Keep hitting him.
[113:06.50]Don't let him get up.
[113:08.86]Don't let him get up.
[113:10.67]Keep hitting him in the head.
[113:11.53]Until the referee stops the fight.
[113:21.11]A get perfect game.
[113:22.41]A get a set.
[113:25.29]Bonus 5,000.
[113:25.87]Let's go.
[113:32.30]I know what to do.
[113:33.36]Just gotta get all the balls on the other side.
[113:34.88]Shit.
[113:37.90]I like this game.
[113:38.50]This game's fun.
[113:40.94]Why can't they have... I want to play this game in real life.
[113:43.74]Don't you?
[113:44.14]This would be so much fun.
[113:47.54]Just get the balls on the other side of the court.
[113:54.40]I didn't catch it.
[113:57.38]Shit.
[113:57.60]He's got time.
[114:00.24]Come on.
[114:00.90]No shit.
[114:03.75]Come on.
[114:04.21]Get it over there.
[114:05.73]I love this one.
[114:06.43]This one's so much fun.
[114:13.07]Shit.
[114:13.33]He's got more over here.
[114:17.02]Get it.
[114:19.30]What is that boomerang?
[114:28.15]Stop!
[114:29.37]Stop!
[114:31.97]That's gotta be it, I win.
[114:33.59]Oh yeah, I win.
[114:34.11]Goodbye.
[114:35.63]Perfect game.
[114:41.77]Alright, this is the last match, right?
[114:51.02]Oh, wait a minute.
[114:53.10]This is different.
[114:56.20]Oh boy, it's like Pong.
[115:00.89]Oh.
[115:03.27]Adding variables.
[115:04.17]I love it.
[115:04.61]Okay.
[115:05.01]Just be good.
[115:05.57]Be good.
[115:05.85]Be good.
[115:06.07]Be good.
[115:09.77]Okay.
[115:09.89]I'm overwhelmed with the hell out of him right now.
[115:11.43]You're in trouble, dude.
[115:14.65]That one's going fast.
[115:28.01]I want to say, okay, I have a spoiler.
[115:29.89]It's like another spoiler, but who cares.
[115:31.97]I have to say it.
[115:32.61]I have to say it.
[115:33.17]Alright.
[115:33.67]I'm going to talk about Star Wars for a second.
[115:36.07]Star Wars Rogue One.
[115:37.35]If you haven't seen Star Wars Rogue One, mute the microphone for five seconds.
[115:42.18]Mute the microphone for five seconds.
[115:43.64]Just mute.
[115:44.20]I don't have to say anything.
[115:52.24]Mute.
[115:52.50]No, like mute.
[115:53.22]Whatever.
[115:56.79]You know what I was going to say.
[115:57.59]Those that know, you know.
[115:58.79]You know exactly what I was going to tell you.
[116:04.57]Don't forget Panda.
[116:05.45]I heard Panda's a pretty top seed.
[116:07.77]He is.
[116:20.25]You guys don't know what I'm talking about?
[116:22.27]I have to say it.
[116:23.51]Alright.
[116:24.33]It's in Rogue One.
[116:25.23]It's how the movie... It's a part... Alright, whatever.
[116:30.42]I don't care.
[116:31.12]I can only know.
[116:31.72]Only me will know.
[116:36.96]Alright, I'm going to say it.
[116:40.20]I'm gonna say Rogue One spoilers.
[116:42.52]So, seriously, don't come back until everyone in this chat says to come back.
[116:45.88]Here we go.
[116:46.38]Here comes a Rogue One spoiler.
[116:47.85]I'm not kidding.
[116:48.81]Three, two, one.
[116:51.25]In the end of the fucking movie, when Darth Vader shows up, and it's like, is that exact same sound effect.
[116:59.19]And now I lost because I was paying attention.
[117:07.63]Okay, you're good.
[117:08.21]Everyone can come back.
[117:14.68]Star Wars fucking sucks.
[117:26.38]Get off me!
[117:28.02]Oh my god, he just perfected me.
[117:29.39]Game's over.
[117:29.79]Alright, where else are we going?
[117:40.77]How about... I did Rockin' Cats.
[117:45.65]I did whop him.
[117:49.27]Hmm... Did I do baseball?
[117:55.53]I didn't do baseball.
[117:57.85]Here's your team.
[117:58.43]It's the C, D, G's, S's, T's, or W's.
[118:01.85]Alright, doesn't matter.
[118:02.61]Alright, I'm at the... I'm playing... Me swinging?
[118:12.14]161 kilometers an hour.
[118:12.88]And that like... How fast is that?
[118:15.64]Isn't it like up to 150 miles per hour?
[118:19.62]I just want to hit a home run.
[118:38.77]Let me hit one home run and I'm done.
[118:44.28]That's close enough.
[118:44.98]Double play.
[118:49.06]Clap.
[118:49.50]Nice, Homer.
[118:52.58]Nice, Ron.
[118:53.64]Oh, I sneezed.
[118:54.45]I'm not allowed to sneeze.
[118:58.05]Where are we going?
[119:00.85]How about brush roller?
[119:04.55]I like it already.
[119:08.45]Is that a loading screen?
[119:18.50]Ugh.
[119:20.34]I think it's just Pac-Man, but instead of collecting the things, you just have to paint the ground?
[119:24.48]Yeah, it is.
[119:26.03]It's actually kind of cute.
[119:32.45]That thing's working fast!
[119:38.32]It's Splatoon.
[119:48.47]Look at the cat.
[119:49.13]Why is there just a cat over there?
[119:50.40]Why are there cats everywhere?
[119:52.66]And a guy driving a car into a wall.
[119:55.86]Does that guy just get into an accident?
[119:57.12]The car looks a little scrunched, doesn't it?
[119:58.78]It looks like squished.
[120:00.74]I think that guy's in trouble.
[120:09.44]Get away.
[120:24.71]Okay, Volgard 2.
[120:26.09]Or how about Xevious?
[120:35.40]Oh, it's just a vertical shooter.
[120:41.49]Is this rings?
[120:42.21]This is just like bathroom washers.
[120:46.65]This is like one of the bins at Home Depot.
[121:02.21]Is this it?
[121:08.13]Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[121:30.13]This is my favorite game? Your taste is- what about- how about- wait- a re an?
[121:37.13]Arena!
[121:42.13]Stage one.
[121:50.61]What?
[121:51.65]Why am I pinned to the wall?
[121:59.38]Um, I don't understand what's going on.
[122:00.88]Do I have a projectile?
[122:04.58]I don't see a projectile, and I can't... I was about to hit the reset button, but I'm gonna try it again.
[122:14.55]Battle for Home Depot.
[122:18.23]I can't get both those guys at the same time.
[122:22.71]Go for the guy on the left first?
[122:24.47]This is impossible.
[122:27.69]It's not possible.
[122:28.17]The game's incompletable.
[122:29.03]Alright, I gotta go to RNG.
[122:34.87]This might work.
[122:43.30]Yeah, tell the muted people to come back.
[122:50.16]How about air alert?
[122:51.52]Oh, I already did this one.
[122:56.47]I did Bird Week already.
[122:57.47]How about Bugs War?
[123:04.13]Yep.
[123:13.02]Am I a spider?
[123:13.78]I have a bomb.
[123:16.53]Bomb?
[123:20.68]Um, wait, what happened?
[123:23.34]Wait, this is Battleship.
[123:28.49]It's Battleship, but one player.
[123:30.51]I have to drop it on caterpillars?
[123:37.05]Okay, yeah.
[123:43.58]Yep, I got him.
[123:51.03]Minesweeper?
[123:51.71]No, this is just Battleship.
[123:52.86]Is he dead?
[123:58.68]Feel more of the head and the tail.
[124:02.96]I feel bad.
[124:03.99]I'm killing him very slowly.
[124:05.63]This is horrible.
[124:24.40]They don't even fight back.
[124:25.50]Yeah, they don't fight back.
[124:26.40]I don't like this one.
[124:30.66]You sunk my caterpillar.
[124:39.07]I did want to see what squoon was.
[124:44.03]Looks very interesting.
[124:45.03]Yeah.
[124:47.23]I have no idea what's going on with this title screen.
[124:52.47]Those sharks are eating people.
[124:56.01]Holy shit, this is horrible.
[125:00.51]It's just the Mario level from Mario Land on the Game Boy.
[125:03.45]Why is there a city down here?
[125:11.21]Wait, there's an entire... Is this supposed to be Atlantis?
[125:28.06]Good.
[125:31.81]This is a fun one.
[125:39.71]Pretty good maneuver there, I think.
[125:42.61]Pretty good maneuvering right there, I think.
[125:47.43]Oh.
[125:48.22]I don't think I can kill the sharks over there.
[125:55.64]I think those are my friends.
[126:06.50]Alright, what's the first boss, what do you think?
[126:07.56]I'm going to say a giant squid.
[126:14.98]What do you think?
[126:28.43]Giant squid, yep.
[126:28.99]I thought that was health.
[126:36.48]I thought that was a health pack.
[126:37.36]It looked like health.
[126:39.12]Alright, first boss incoming.
[126:44.38]Oh.
[126:50.70]This one's good.
[126:51.16]I like this one a lot.
[126:52.06]This is fun.
[127:05.00]Dude, that juke.
[127:06.14]Oh, come on.
[127:08.10]Continue.
[127:18.05]Submarine is cute.
[127:19.19]Yeah, submarine is cute.
[127:21.67]Wait, hold on.
[127:25.43]Star luster.
[127:29.45]That's the Star Fox font.
[127:31.37]So, I have a lot of hopes for this one.
[127:36.81]It's training, command, and adventure.
[127:38.57]I think this is supposed to be text.
[127:45.11]All we have is E's and B's.
[127:50.59]Wait, is this like an old text-based RPG?
[128:00.75]I selected B.
[128:11.37]Hello?
[128:11.63]There's a dot on the screen, but what is it?
[128:26.40]Am I facing the right direction?
[128:35.74]How do I get the dot on my screen?
[128:42.85]I don't get it.
[128:43.49]Wait, that's me.
[128:44.17]Oh shit, I'm flying.
[129:03.38]Where am I supposed to go?
[129:11.94]That's me right there.
[129:12.88]Alright, but where am I supposed to go?
[129:14.32]Alright, we're going to E. Something's blinking.
[129:35.93]Oh, there's something here.
[129:41.21]Alien life!
[129:46.64]I'm on a steal.
[129:55.56]I'm on a steal.
[130:03.69]I could be flying upside down right now.
[130:05.43]I have no idea.
[130:06.33]No, what?
[130:18.51]These are bad guys.
[130:19.23]E for Enemy.
[130:46.81]Get me out of here.
[130:47.93]I want to, wait, I want to do adventure.
[130:49.51]I want to see.
[130:50.13]Uh-oh.
[130:56.07]Uh-oh.
[130:59.53]Uh-oh.
[131:02.45]Uh-oh.
[131:11.20]Wait, good.
[131:14.90]What was, I don't even remember what it was called.
[131:19.50]Was it squoon?
[131:20.30]Star luster.
[131:20.80]Alright.
[131:24.18]Adventure.
[131:26.02]Here we go.
[131:27.65]Okay.
[131:28.15]So let's see.
[131:32.33]We're going to go to over here.
[131:47.78]Okay.
[131:47.98]What's here?
[131:52.46]Radio.
[131:55.72]I'd like to call- I'd like to have a radio frequent- who cares?
[131:58.64]It said destroy all enemies and defend the universe.
[132:03.78]Really?
[132:04.02]How about O-Bake?
[132:16.07]Ready?
[132:17.03]Food!
[132:17.49]You make- this is a cooking game?
[132:23.51]Watch out for the dogs and just collect all the food.
[132:25.47]Whoa, this is Donald Duck.
[132:32.06]It's chubby cherub.
[132:33.08]I'm going to sneeze.
[132:40.02]Sorry, I can't help that.
[132:45.03]Oh, nice, Ron.
[132:46.51]Oh, I sneezed.
[132:48.21]I'm not allowed to sneeze?
[132:57.18]There we go, that's better.
[133:02.14]Now the reference can be complete.
[133:04.94]I never have to do it again.
[133:05.84]Did that kill me?
[133:13.06]Best nice run of the year.
[133:19.42]It's been two, so you have a choice.
[133:22.58]2021, year of the nice Ron.
[133:36.87]I can fly.
[133:41.22]That would have been nice to know.
[133:53.32]Is this the life of a seagull?
[133:54.54]Or like a pigeon?
[134:00.58]Just flying around eating like apple cores and really?
[134:02.63]Okay, I'm done.
[134:07.13]Not allowed to sneeze Andy.
[134:13.90]Hmm.
[134:20.50]Did we do banana prints?
[134:21.52]We did, right?
[134:26.40]Bomb sweeper?
[134:27.60]No.
[134:28.40]10-yard fight.
[134:30.81]This sounds good.
[134:31.81]Oh, it's a high school first at 10 yards?
[134:36.61]Isn't football 100?
[134:37.31]Do I have the ball?
[134:46.79]This is a dance!
[135:00.53]Okay, do I get to pick a play?
[135:05.77]It's like tap dancing!
[135:10.80]Holy shit, he got it!
[135:16.34]Get away, get away, get away!
[135:19.04]You're gonna get it!
[135:19.50]Come on!
[135:26.47]First to ten, first down!
[135:32.20]And... Hup!
[135:37.84]Interception?
[135:38.36]Did you intercept it?
[135:45.32]Fuck!
[135:45.86]No!
[135:46.32]What?
[135:49.52]They're doing... They're doing... Look at me!
[135:53.28]Look at me!
[135:54.38]Look at me!
[135:57.66]Oh my fucking god.
[135:58.56]It's another interception.
[136:00.24]Wait.
[136:01.96]If I throw for an interception, that's the other team's ball.
[136:05.56]Why am I throwing... No, it's just putting me back 20 yards.
[136:18.73]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[136:26.73]What the fuck is this?
[136:27.41]How can you even understand American football?
[136:31.72]Look, here's how it works.
[136:34.40]When somebody has the ball, they have to just go 10 yards.
[136:39.80]Somehow.
[136:41.24]If they do not go 10 yards, they have to try again.
[136:44.91]You can only try four times before you have to give the team the other ball and they do it the other way.
[136:50.73]That's it.
[136:55.09]And don't even pay attention to the goalpost thing.
[136:57.39]You're probably like, what the fuck are those for?
[136:59.67]There is a bonus feature.
[137:09.40]Are you fucking kidding me?
[137:21.96]How am I... By the way, this is not supposed to be happening.
[137:26.11]If I throw an interception... God damn it.
[137:30.17]That's a safety.
[137:35.85]20 yards back.
[137:36.83]I'm in my own goal.
[137:45.92]Wait, I can't leave?
[137:47.02]What was that gun?
[137:59.43]What?
[138:00.65]What was that?
[138:15.12]Fake football.
[138:16.74]How about Pac-Land?
[138:18.50]This one should be good.
[138:26.31]Oh yes.
[138:26.81]This is Pac-Land.
[138:38.07]Okay, so A is walk right, B is walk left, and all the directionals are just jump.
[138:44.85]It's really weird.
[138:45.45]Is this the smash stage?
[138:52.47]Could be.
[138:54.44]Why does he have a zoomer haircut?
[139:05.92]It actually is the smash stage?
[139:15.60]I don't think there's an end.
[139:20.64]I think we just walk forward forever.
[139:23.66]Wait, it's break time!
[139:57.02]What song is this?
[139:58.78]I've heard this song.
[140:00.04]Where?
[140:00.28]Did I jump on his head?
[140:11.02]It's Pac-Land Stage 1.
[140:13.68]What is it though?
[140:20.67]It's Toxic by Britney Spears.
[140:32.46]Don't you know that you're toxic?
[140:40.40]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[140:41.93]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[140:43.87]I want to...
[140:50.05]Is it close?
[140:55.86]It's not even close Is it close?
[140:59.20]I don't even care
[141:21.98]I'm not going to play it through the speakers.
[141:30.31]No, it's not.
[141:31.57]It's not even close.
[141:34.69]Do the MIDI version.
[141:36.99]It's not even close.
[141:38.67]It's like in some way it could be.
[141:43.86]It's very much not even close.
[141:45.80]But I kind of understand what you mean.
[141:56.18]I'm addicted to you.
[141:57.68]Don't you know that you're toxic?
[142:12.25]Stop.
[142:12.77]I can't help it.
[142:14.52]Can we stop this game?
[142:15.62]It's the Flintstones?
[142:18.86]Okay, where are we going?
[142:27.20]We didn't play Street Fighter.

[142:38.48]Is this supposed to be a map?
[142:41.20]So that's how- is that supposed to be a map of the world?
[142:44.63]U.S.S.
[142:45.43]The United States of the- of what?
[142:49.43]It's supposed to be R. China is below Russia, and then Japan, but that's sort of- Japan's right there.
[142:56.92]Japan's there.
[142:58.52]There's two U.S.A.'s.
[143:02.79]And then there's India, and then Japan again.
[143:13.52]United Soviet States of America.
[143:15.52]Okay.

[144:39.83]Real-time action adventure.
[144:41.97]Something's wrong with that text.
[144:44.18]Level, L or H?
[144:46.91]Low or high?
[144:47.77]Where should I put the gas tank?

[144:59.02]Or I'm going to break down.
[145:01.26]These are spoilers.
[145:04.88]I don't want to see this.
[145:05.44]We're going right in the middle.
[145:16.81]Stop the express!
[145:17.71]Alright, stop the express!

[146:09.87]The game's really laggy.
[146:14.35]There's a guy up here.
[146:15.11]There he is.
[146:17.07]Come on.
[146:23.95]Stop.
[146:24.59]I can't help it.
[146:25.37]I'm gonna keep going.
[146:34.45]Oh my god, I was not even looking at the game!
[146:42.47]Where was I even looking?
[146:43.33]My eyes were on a chat.
[146:44.25]They weren't on the screen.
[146:46.58]Where was I even looking?
[146:47.78]Where were my eyes?
[146:48.58]What was I looking at?
[146:49.40]I don't know.
[146:51.16]Above the monitor?
[146:52.02]I have no idea.
[146:52.60]I did it again.
[146:53.00]I did it again.
[146:54.04]I did it again.
[146:55.12]I did it again.
[146:56.04]Alright.
[146:56.48]I'm going to get to the end of the train right now.
[146:58.02]Alright.
[147:03.65]Let's go.
[147:04.09]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[147:05.49]Come on.
[147:13.99]No, I... Oops, I... Oops, I did it again.
[147:21.93]Oops, I did it again.
[147:24.17]I played with your heart.
[147:25.87]Lost in the scene.
[147:27.31]Ooh, baby, baby.
[147:28.33]Ooh, I knew... Is he throwing shit underneath?
[147:50.88]They're coming from all angles, they're coming from all angles now.
[147:54.04]Jerry!
[147:54.34]They're coming from all angles!
[147:58.20]The storm?
[148:04.04]What the fuck?
[148:04.68]Does that thing have a- is that alive?
[148:07.94]This is a mess!
[148:09.77]I can't- when I walk forward, it comes with me!
[148:12.69]What the fuck?
[148:16.01]Uh, what about Warwolf?
[148:16.69]AAA.
[148:16.79]Right.
[148:18.05]That's it.
[148:18.31]It's just AAA.
[148:46.92]No idea what this says.
[148:47.78]War Wolf is coming to town.
[148:52.48]One player push start.
[148:56.76]Which one of us is the War Wolf?
[149:01.64]Uh, that?
[149:02.20]Is that the War Wolf?
[149:08.15]I didn't figure that out.
[149:10.13]You guys can figure that out.
[149:15.81]Um, okay.
[149:16.37]Wait.
[149:25.18]Look at that neck!
[149:29.75]Is there anything I can do?
[149:30.75]I have an anger meter?
[149:46.76]I'm just punching him in the groin over and over again.
[149:49.26]This is the most coward way to fight somebody right now.
[149:53.86]Really?
[149:55.12]I will challenge you in a one-on-one battle.
[149:58.20]We'll see who the strongest grappler is.
[149:59.70]I'm going to crouch down and punch you in the groin and run away every time.
[150:13.23]I think I just transformed twice.
[150:14.77]Okay, we went from beast to raccoon.
[150:21.35]What is going on here?
[150:22.61]Okay, please stop that.
[150:24.51]I have to turn it off if it keeps doing this.
[150:30.19]Alright, so you saw the transformation.
[150:32.34]This is not the type of move I would expect from that elaborate insane transformation.
[150:57.17]Ah, shit.
[150:57.73]This is like, uh... What's that?
[150:59.59]Rise from the grave.
[151:03.11]Welcome to your tomb.
[151:05.17]Altered Beast, right?
[151:10.04]You guys ever feel like that they're gonna... Altered Beast is this type of old, nostalgic kind of Genesis game that they're gonna make into a Netflix series?
[151:18.22]Yeah, I could feel that, couldn't you?
[151:20.20]I could see that.
[151:28.27]Because there's absolutely no lore there, and they can just make up an entire thing.
[151:31.70]And they can run on the... Remember that Genesis game?
[151:34.62]Altered Beast!
[151:46.47]As long as they get, like, 10,000 streams, I'm sure it'll be worth it.
[151:52.53]Climb this.
[151:53.05]Climb this!
[151:58.57]Nice.
[151:58.87]This game's actually pretty rad.
[152:11.50]I want to do the boss fight.
[152:15.66]Don't knock.
[152:16.58]Well, I have to knock it now.
[152:17.40]Wait, don't knock.
[152:19.54]Of course I have to knock that now.
[152:20.74]Are you going to tell me not to do something?
[152:21.88]I'm going to do it.
[152:32.26]I lost my... I shouldn't have knocked.
[152:40.86]How about... Oh, we're going.
[152:46.31]I did Rockin' Cats.
[152:48.81]I did Bird Week.
[152:52.11]I did Bomberman.
[152:56.36]Crackin' Pop?
[153:00.46]Crackin' Pop.
[153:06.21]Those are bombs.
[153:08.57]Okay.
[153:08.83]This game sucks.
[153:20.47]What is that guy with the pill doing? ...
[153:36.84]Bubble Bobble Monster is here.
[153:38.68]Am I taking too long?
[153:43.57]His legs.
[153:51.17]I got a feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night.
[153:58.38]That tonight's gonna be a good night.
[154:01.98]That tonight's gonna be a good, good night.
[154:11.48]That meme is going parabolic.
[154:15.88]I'm sorry.
[154:16.44]What do you want me to do?
[154:20.37]How about Spelunker?
[154:29.67]Spelunker!
[154:36.95]I died.
[154:37.93]I'm dead.
[154:38.88]Okay.
[154:41.86]And again.
[154:42.12]I have a machine gun.
[154:48.96]It's a gold coin.
[154:52.27]I can get the gold coins.
[154:52.95]Oh, here's the item shop.
[154:59.11]Really?
[155:01.63]Really?
[155:03.03]That's not very far to fall.
[155:07.36]Okay.
[155:10.62]Had enough of that one.
[155:19.63]Did we do aimless?
[155:23.41]Nope, but I can see... I would be... Okay, game over.
[155:32.96]This would be very impressive for an 11-year-old school project.
[155:39.31]Wouldn't it?
[155:39.69]This would be like, holy shit, this is incredible work.
[155:43.50]Like, the 12-year-old that made this in the computer lab, you are really going places.
[155:47.92]You really are.
[155:48.38]Like, I'm not even kidding around.
[155:49.60]Like, this is what you had made.
[155:50.50]And you're, like, getting into programming and you're learning.
[155:55.87]And this is such a huge step in your journey to kind of do, like, online programming and game development stuff.
[156:02.62]This is a huge deal.
[156:12.21]Kind of want to see what happens if you kill five.
[156:13.41]I wonder if I get to kill five more.
[156:18.90]Three more.
[156:41.54]I don't want to play Sudoku.
[156:50.66]The Exder?
[156:56.24]Ugh.
[156:58.64]Too close.
[157:00.23]I'm a person.
[157:01.19]What?
[157:02.75]I thought I was a plane.
[157:04.99]No, no, no, no, no.
[157:05.67]What are you thinking about, Jeremy?
[157:06.73]You're the Exder.
[157:08.73]Part man, part machine, part plane, part boat, part person.
[157:20.52]Holy shit!
[157:22.66]This is awesome!
[157:24.40]This is actually really cool.
[157:25.66]This is the most elaborate Mario Maker level I've ever seen.
[157:38.24]I cannot aim that, by the way.
[157:39.46]How do I transform?
[158:08.29]Did that.
[158:08.77]Did Mario.
[158:09.43]Did we do Ninja 2?
[158:13.79]I don't believe we did.
[158:22.98]It kind of looks like Bart.
[158:29.10]Well, yeah, or Homer.
[158:36.63]I love that sound.
[158:37.37]That...
[158:40.93]Did I just kill a bird?
[158:42.09]What did I knock down?
[158:43.78]What the hell was that?
[158:52.08]I'm hurting animals in the tree.
[158:53.36]I don't want to do that.
[159:01.39]All cartoon music comes to the same place, doesn't it?
[159:05.84]Do I have health?
[159:09.34]No, I'm not going to do a Simpsons impression.
[159:11.28]No, I'm not because it's going to get on the list.
[159:12.82]Nope, not happening.
[159:13.66]I will never do a Homer Simpson impression again.
[159:18.30]That's not going to happen.
[159:19.93]I already know it's going to happen.
[159:21.59]I'm not going to do it.
[159:22.11]I'm not going to do any of The Simpsons.
[159:27.47]Nope.
[159:29.15]I'm not doing it.
[159:38.19]There's 500 million off the debt?
[159:39.37]What?
[159:43.29]I'm not doing it for anything less than that.
[159:53.61]No deal.
[159:54.03]Yeah, I'm seeing a lot of no deals.
[159:55.33]It's not gonna happen.
[160:00.78]Hey, when does the Cuphead DLC come out?
[160:04.92]Not soon.
[160:07.40]Springtime or something?
[160:09.86]Pull, pull, pull.
[160:13.22]Ow!
[160:15.16]What the fuck?
[160:16.20]Why did pausing that just... Oh my god, I can't pause the game!
[160:21.91]Why did it do that?
[160:22.99]Holy shit!
[160:28.53]Okay.
[160:30.09]I'm gonna do... Can I just confirm that that was what was happening?
[160:35.66]Turn your volume down.
[160:36.50]I want to confirm that that was happening.
[160:39.10]Turn your volume down.
[160:44.56]Yep.
[160:45.14]Oh my god.
[160:46.00]Alright, straw poll.
[160:52.58]Let's see if you guys really want that.
[160:55.27]I'll do it for 500 million.
[161:11.33]Okay, Simpson's impression for $500 million off debt.
[161:19.63]It's just a yes or no.
[161:24.78]The only way I'm going to do it.
[161:42.83]Are you serious?
[161:44.65]Are you kidding me?
[161:45.48]This is the easiest bet I've ever made.
[161:49.20]This is the easiest amount of... Of course I'm going to do this.
[161:54.44]500 million.
[161:55.20]Are you guys kidding me?
[162:00.32]Wow.
[162:01.06]This is a freebie.
[162:01.90]You guys are throwing me a meatball here.
[162:13.46]500 million off the debt.
[162:14.26]This is 60%.
[162:15.40]This is an absolute majority.
[162:22.71]Okay.
[162:23.73]Alright, here we go.
[162:24.53]We better take 500 million off.
[162:26.59]Here we go.
[162:30.39]Here we go.
[162:35.51]Is there a certain line you want me to say?
[162:38.86]As Homer?
[162:40.80]Homer?
[162:48.74]Say, eat my shorts as Homer.
[162:50.56]That's not what he says.
[162:53.48]Okay.
[162:55.62]Mmm, beer.
[163:01.64]Mmm, duff.
[163:04.56]And let me tell you something, Bart.

[163:15.87]Sure thing, Dad.
[163:16.63]I'll go and get you a beer.
[163:19.28]Waka waka.
[163:22.17]Homer, I don't like the fact that you're drinking so much on a weekday.
[163:27.57]Marge, can you just stop complaining and stop telling me to do things?
[163:35.29]Mmm, beer.
[163:44.84]Now, Maggie, you need breakfast?
[163:49.58]Mmm, breakfast.
[163:53.08]It's me, Lisa, coming down the stairs.
[163:56.63]Well, hi, diddly-ho, neighbors.
[164:02.07]I'm in your window.
[164:03.45]I'll take the $500 million, please.
[164:16.25]I'll take 500 million removed from the fucking debt.
[164:20.83]Where's Bart?
[164:21.44]He already ran in.
[164:22.26]He skated on his skateboard.
[164:23.40]He didn't ollie.
[164:28.24]Double nothing for the entire Griffin family?
[164:31.58]Are we taking a billion off if I do the whole Griffin family?
[164:35.18]The entire Griffin family.
[164:36.42]One billion?
[164:36.70]Are we kidding?
[164:50.52]Hold on, I'm gonna be wiping my fucking debt clean right now.
[164:59.25]He does this for free all the time, but I have banned it completely as of four days ago.
[165:05.71]It has to be all of them.
[165:10.79]You have to say, welcome to JermaCraft as Peter.
[165:13.61]Oh my, okay, fine.
[165:16.27]Okay, I will do a welcome to JermaCraft as the entire Griffin family.
[165:27.07]For a double or nothing for a billion off.

[165:36.81]That like two or three, that like little paragraph section.
[165:39.92]I'm going to pull, I'm doing a poll.
[165:49.01]griffin family never in a fucking million years like 10 20 years ago but I've thought that'd be sitting in a chair here going back and forth arguing with 11 000 people about removing debt from my fucking name to do like the entire griffin family in a JermaCraft copy pasta like what what this this was not even possible in my brain like even five years ago
[166:19.24]You have to do it with the face cam on.

[174:04.03]This is going to be a single player Let's Play.
[174:06.11]And when I say Let's Play, I use that term pretty loosely because I am an idiot in this game.
[174:12.46]You're going to see lots of fails.
[174:14.20]You're going to see lots of triumphs.
[174:15.90]At least I'm hoping.
[174:17.14]So grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa.
[174:20.80]I got apple cider right here.
[174:22.60]Freshly brewed.

[178:01.49]Peter, this is going to be a single player Let's Play.
[178:04.19]And when I say Let's Play, I use that term pretty loosely.
[178:07.26]Fuck!
[178:19.77]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

[179:38.37]Because Brian sings in like fucking 80 episodes.
[179:42.07]Because Seth MacFarlane is like a good singer, and Brian's pretty close to his speaking voice, so he just makes sure that he's gonna sing as Brian so he can show everybody how good of a singer he is.
[179:49.82]Okay.
[179:52.32]Okay.

[201:14.37]Is this the same one we just played?
[201:23.53]Is that the same music as when we played yesterday too?
[201:34.74]Are you kidding me?
[201:35.96]No, we're not playing this one.
[201:36.82]This one sucks.
[201:39.79]Mario 7?
[201:40.37]There is no Mario 7.

[202:27.86]Put the waffle on the waffle maker.
[202:34.03]Oh, okay, candy.
[202:35.05]That has to be in a row.
[202:37.53]I think it has to be in a row?

[208:22.55]I'm done.
[208:34.63]That performance deserves a big swig of soy.
[208:38.30]Too bad I don't have any access to any of these soy-based products.
[208:41.92]I do have access to a Huel, which is not soy-based.
[208:46.64]It's got 400 calories, 20 grams of protein, omega-3s, all your vitamins.
[208:53.07]Not overly sweet.
[208:53.99]It's only got 5 grams of sugar.
[208:57.03]I drank this shit, and it helped me.
[208:58.67]I'm telling you, this is not a fucking... No one's paying me to do this.
[209:02.25]It actually helped me.

[219:42.84]Why is he so evil?
[219:48.37]This is not even an evil thing going on right now.
[219:50.41]Why is this so sinister?
[219:53.04]He's raining down like candy and presents and food, but very, very menacingly.
[220:01.72]Oh, that's why.
[220:02.60]Because now he's throwing bombs.
[220:08.25]He's trying to get you to accidentally grab the bomb. ...
[220:19.30]Why is Santa up in the sky?
[220:20.64]Okay, if they had a sleigh that he was leaning out of or something?
[220:28.48]Or the fact that he's just Zeus up there throwing down presents?
[220:45.31]Oh, that was evil.
[220:46.29]He just threw like an evil face.
[220:47.55]It made me slow.
[220:51.60]Santa killed God and took his place.
[220:53.32]Alright, I'm gonna pick up a bomb, just see what happens.
[221:06.41]There was anger behind that one.
[221:07.85]He threw that hard.
[221:08.69]Alright, let me see a bomb.
[221:15.04]Oh my god, that's
[221:25.87]Jesus.
[221:29.79]Bro.
[221:30.17]Alright, where's chess?
[221:33.85]There it is, 93.
[221:34.27]I don't know how to play this version.

[222:22.18]Golf.
[222:22.94]Yep.
[222:27.73]Yep, it's Mario Golf.
[222:28.91]Alright, we're going right straight ahead right here.
[222:37.73]Good hit.
[222:43.97]It's funny, through the years Mario has... Oh, that was way too hard.
[222:49.36]Through the years Mario has had like a normal human body.
[222:51.72]It's always funny when you see him pop up in random little Nintendo games with just like a normal person's body.
[223:01.13]Why am I going so hard?
[223:08.22]Oh, it's because I'm using one wood.
[223:10.20]Okay, let's put it.
[223:23.43]Fuck.
[223:30.23]What just happened?
[223:36.17]Okay.
[223:39.13]Alright, we're going for a hole-in-one first try.
[223:42.37]Straight over the water.
[223:43.17]Didn't work.
[223:57.10]Okay, I feel like we've been neglecting the 400s.
[224:05.85]Cyber... Cybernoid?
[224:10.04]Okay, Nintendo program.
[224:14.52]Choose level of difficulty using the select button.
[224:16.69]Whatever.
[224:18.73]Cybernoid.
[224:19.31]I'm just falling forever.
[224:26.57]Okay.
[224:33.78]Can I ever go down?
[224:34.56]How am I supposed to do this?
[224:45.13]That was awful.
[224:45.59]Alright, what was the nav- that was something- Star Force?
[224:55.38]Space E.T.
[224:58.80]It's just Space Invaders.
[224:59.88]God damn it, they put E.T.
[225:01.02]on it though.
[225:09.56]This is a classic.
[225:15.71]You guys getting tired?
[225:36.75]You guys getting like a little sleepy here?
[225:40.00]Yeah, it's okay.
[225:40.92]You can go to bed for a little while.
[225:42.76]I'll wake you up in a little bit.
[225:44.83]Some nice relaxing Space Invaders in the background.
[225:50.41]I'll wake you up soon.
[225:52.23]Fuck, I lost.
[225:53.49]This game sucks.
[225:56.48]Space Invaders is actually really fun.
[226:03.38]Wait, Cub Adventure.
[226:16.39]My little panda?
[226:17.69]Polar bear?
[226:18.15]I just wanted to collect everything and then run to the exit.
[226:23.47]These are the worst games ever.
[226:39.93]I did all the work.
[226:40.55]That guy didn't do anything.

[229:41.11]Have you ever watched Cowboy Bebop?
[229:42.29]I have, yeah.
[229:47.07]It's a good animated television series.
[229:49.45]How about Wisdom?
[229:55.43]Wisdom Boy.
[230:04.71]I'm on easy.
[230:05.73]I don't care.
[230:08.71]Level 1.
[230:10.78]Wisdom.
[230:13.02]Oh, it's one of these.
[230:13.86]Is that just to put pieces in here?
[230:16.84]No, I'm done.
[230:17.82]I don't want to play it.
[230:20.58]Time's up on that one.
[230:28.83]Quarterback?
[230:30.79]Yep.
[230:33.31]John Madden?
[230:34.05]No, that's not John Madden.
[230:35.23]That's a different John.
[230:36.97]Who is that?
[230:37.79]John Elway?
[230:42.13]Select team.
[230:42.61]New England.
[230:42.97]I want to be New England.
[230:48.47]I want to hit start on New England.
[230:51.81]No, I don't fucking San Francisco.
[230:53.71]What?
[231:05.30]Shit.
[231:07.84]Oh, nice.
[231:08.36]Alright.
[231:08.62]We're going to do a bomb pass every single play.
[231:18.93]That's not pass, that's dive.
[231:25.59]Pass must be B. Okay.
[231:42.39]Try that again.
[231:53.72]What's happening?
[231:54.24]I'm European.
[231:55.48]Oh, just American things.
[232:02.29]I got it.
[232:02.59]It's the first down.
[232:17.36]Who is the ball?
[232:28.85]You know how I play every football game?
[232:30.07]I... Okay.
[232:31.77]Tell me if you guys did this shit too.
[232:32.97]So my brother and I used to play like Madden all the time.
[232:37.45]And I was never very good.
[232:39.33]But how I always played is I would always just cycle.
[232:43.24]Because you could only control one person at a time.
[232:46.62]So what I would do is I would cycle to every single person.
[232:48.94]So let's say it was like A to cycle to your defensive line or your tailgater or whatever they are.
[232:56.24]I would cycle to every single person and hit the dive button immediately when the indicator went over their head.
[233:01.70]So it would just be like dive, dive, dive, dive, dive, dive, dive, dive, dive, dive.
[233:04.38]And maybe I would hit the person that had the ball sometimes and it would be infuriating for him.
[233:13.33]So it would just be select, dive, select, dive, select, dive, select, dive.
[233:17.44]And it works.
[233:19.44]But if it doesn't work, it's a guaranteed run backward touchdown.
[233:22.60]So my brother would win a lot of the times we played Madden, like 80 plus points to like six.
[233:31.09]So I was not very good at it.
[233:40.48]Oh.
[233:42.42]First down, 20 yards.
[233:52.55]Just bomb it into the end zone.
[233:55.11]Got it.
[233:55.33]It's a cool story, bro.
[234:01.26]Alright, time the person off for 17 days.
[234:12.96]Oh, touchdown, touchdown, touchdown, touchdown.
[234:15.84]Oh.
[234:17.90]Is your nose still wheezing?
[234:19.06]No, I'm fine.
[234:19.44]70.
[234:21.38]I don't know.
[234:22.40]How many seconds is that?
[234:23.36]Oh, that's a touchdown if I've ever seen one.
[234:30.19]Touchdown if I've ever seen one.
[234:34.25]Go Patriots.
[234:35.59]Go Patriots.
[234:36.67]That's terrible this year.
[234:38.01]And like Tom Brady left.
[234:39.67]So like, what are we going to do now?
[234:41.41]What are we going to do now?
[234:42.43]Brady's gone, man.
[234:44.15]Brady's fucking gone.
[234:45.15]Holy shit, this is hard.
[234:48.07]What the heck?
[234:56.60]Brady's gone, man.
[235:01.72]Muscle.
[235:07.28]Who do I want to be?
[235:10.37]Should I be the face, just bald?
[235:12.77]I don't know.
[235:13.41]Who should I be?
[235:17.68]The knight.
[235:27.82]Oh, it... Holy shit, this game is awesome.
[235:33.54]I don't know, what character am I?
[235:36.43]Okay, I think I'm green guy.
[235:43.65]Who's out there?
[235:44.45]Who's that?
[235:45.61]Hey!
[235:47.21]Did a little kid... Did somebody shoot something in here?
[235:52.30]You got a smash ball.
[235:53.50]Are you serious?
[235:54.30]Look at the guy watching down there.
[236:02.72]What the fuck?
[236:07.41]Um...
[236:22.48]God damn it.
[236:23.00]I tried for a big play.
[236:24.92]Going on the top rope.
[236:35.31]Fortnite dancing?
[236:41.19]I got the smash ball this time.
[236:43.95]I threw an axe at him.
[236:55.94]I got another one.
[236:57.52]Oh, he's done.
[236:57.98]I taunt towards the camera every time.
[237:04.62]Yeah, I got him.
[237:10.91]Don't let him tag in.
[237:11.83]Don't let him tag in.
[237:12.59]Fuck.
[237:18.52]This is Grandpa Homer or Grandpa Simpson.
[237:25.27]Shit.
[237:25.53]He got the pill.
[237:29.19]Just avoid him.
[237:29.81]Run away.
[237:33.27]I got to tag out.
[237:36.93]Tag out.
[237:37.39]Tag out.
[237:37.77]Tag.
[237:38.03]Come on, dude.
[237:39.55]Tag out.
[237:40.65]Tag out.
[237:41.82]Tag out.
[237:54.64]Uh-oh.
[237:55.46]I think I broke it.
[237:56.04]Did I break it?
[238:04.72]Oh, I can see.
[238:05.12]We're good.
[238:10.45]Alright, what do you guys think?
[238:14.93]What should we do?
[238:15.57]How about bowling?
[238:18.05]Yeah, definitely.
[238:25.06]Clay Macross?
[238:25.90]Alright, I will after this.
[238:26.60]Ball.
[238:35.07]I always go with the 7-pound ball.
[238:36.93]Lighter.
[238:37.21]There's more room to move.
[238:46.17]That's how you get a guaranteed strike right down the middle.
[238:52.50]Mario 7 ball.
[238:56.36]It has to be lighter for your scrawny arms.
[239:02.00]That's fine.
[239:02.61]It's okay.
[239:03.83]Yeah, I got smaller... I got big arms.
[239:06.33]What are you talking about?
[239:19.76]Hold on, what if I go... I'm going to roll it down really, really slow.
[239:24.88]See if I can get a diaper strike.
[239:35.05]You get a big dump truck.
[239:37.07]You think so?
[239:37.45]Alright, let's see if I can have it go right down the middle.
[239:43.98]Kind of slow, but whatever.
[239:44.76]I wanted it to be all the way down.
[239:50.75]Come on, nice and slow.
[239:57.66]Oops.
[240:02.32]Still got it.
[240:13.15]There it goes.
[240:13.61]Zero power.
[240:14.23]That's what I wanted.
[240:22.80]Oh, well.
[240:33.40]Bowling is fun!
[240:35.88]Goodbye!
[240:37.70]You invented bowling?
[240:38.66]Holy shit, dude.
[240:40.18]You must be like a millionaire or something.
[240:41.52]Alright, back to the 400s.
[240:54.99]Space Hunter Transformers 634 Ken.
[240:59.29]Okay.
[241:03.67]Oh, there's like a low strike?
[241:14.01]A high strike?
[241:17.15]Am I in a race with the dog?
[241:18.95]Look at the top.
[241:22.40]This is a race with the dog.
[241:24.10]I have to beat the dog to the finish line?
[241:31.03]Wait, how?
[241:31.73]Wait, hold on.
[241:38.01]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[241:44.02]The dog doesn't have any obstacles.
[241:45.64]Only I have obstacles?
[241:58.41]Shit, how much health do I have?
[242:00.53]Oh my fucking god, I gotta beat this.
[242:02.39]I gotta beat this dog.
[242:04.75]I gotta beat this fucking dog.
[242:16.02]Okay, we're good.
[242:17.74]Come on, dude.
[242:18.72]Seriously.
[242:19.86]Ugh.
[242:27.75]I'm not sure those... I don't need to collect those swords for anything.
[242:31.93]Just taking up space.
[242:32.63]In my inventory.
[242:35.95]Watch out!
[242:43.68]Alright, I'm winning by a lot.
[242:48.32]Ugh, this is kind of hurting my eyes looking at this.
[243:00.15]He's so fast!
[243:06.23]Dog is way behind.
[243:07.21]I'm doing good.
[243:13.43]He's way behind.
[243:20.97]Now it's raining caterpillars.
[243:22.18]Just don't get hit again.
[243:24.28]I can take my time.
[243:35.49]Whoa.
[243:41.26]It's the seven plagues?
[243:44.38]This is ridiculous, dude.
[243:45.56]How am I supposed to do this without getting killed?
[243:48.72]I'm so mad.
[243:49.70]I'm so mad.
[243:51.86]I don't want to do it again, but I have to.
[243:54.38]Now I get it.
[243:54.84]I understand what's happening.
[243:56.71]Why do I have to race the dog?
[243:57.87]What's the point of racing the dog?
[244:09.68]Fuck you.
[244:10.20]Fucking walkie-talkie sound.
[244:22.10]Roger.
[244:22.70]Yep, I hear you.
[244:23.70]Loud and clear.
[244:26.46]Dog still behind you?
[244:27.76]Yeah, he is.
[244:28.76]Roger that.
[244:35.06]Oh my god, I hate this game.
[244:36.31]I don't care.
[244:50.11]Okay, we have back future.
[244:53.19]Is this back to the future?
[245:03.09]Back to the future!
[245:04.11]This looks like the real game.
[245:07.13]I believe it is.
[245:11.69]I've never even seen these movies start to finish.
[245:31.79]I've seen him ride on a hoverboard.
[245:37.79]Is it?
[245:43.61]I've never seen it.
[245:46.07]And when the DeLorean... What's it called?
[245:48.13]Yeah, when the...
[246:04.85]The Dandelorian?
[246:07.67]The Mandalorian?
[246:08.69]Yeah, when the Mandalorian gets to like 75,000 miles per hour, right?
[246:11.95]Okay, this game is not good.
[246:19.76]It's very bad.
[246:20.48]Even if it was the official game, it's very bad.
[246:29.67]He's on the Reddit shelf.
[246:30.49]I have to play it.
[246:39.42]Discontrol, okay.
[246:42.82]Um, yes.
[246:47.78]What's Grillmaster doing here?
[246:54.53]Let's go.
[246:54.99]Let's go, Q-Bert.
[247:22.57]This game is... What a classic Super Nintendo game.
[247:31.46]I forgot the controls.
[247:48.31]Get away from me.
[247:50.27]Get away from me.
[247:53.09]I just completed Q-Bert.
[248:01.47]Level two.
[248:05.75]What square do you think he's saying?
[248:07.80]I think it's shit.
[248:11.02]I think it's
[248:13.16]Fuck.
[248:14.40]Ass.
[248:24.39]Balls!
[248:25.07]Alright, everybody say your favorite YouTuber.
[248:32.15]3, 2, 1.
[248:32.21]Go.
[248:45.71]We did Toy Factor.
[248:46.45]We did Upmost Warfare.
[248:47.51]We did, uh... We didn't do Wild Worm.
[248:54.37]Pretty wild.
[249:02.46]Do an ego check?
[249:06.12]Um, sure.
[249:09.14]Wait, this one looks fun.
[249:11.45]I have to eat the fruit to get stronger, probably?
[249:13.35]Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[249:15.57]It's just avoiding all the chaos.
[249:17.91]Get big enough and strong enough to eat them.
[249:20.85]I played this game on PopCap, the feeding the fish game.
[249:26.65]Yep, let's get huge.
[249:38.92]Am I big enough to eat anybody?
[249:39.88]I don't think I'm big enough to eat that.
[249:42.34]Am I?
[249:46.47]I'll try.
[249:48.69]Nope.
[249:50.69]Whatever.
[250:05.39]Caterpillars don't eat other bugs.
[250:06.99]Don't they eat like their decaying bodies or something?
[250:14.92]Are they goonies?
[250:15.36]It's just like the bumper sticker where it just shows how many people are in that person's family.
[250:25.86]On the back of their like window.
[250:32.37]Okay.
[250:41.99]I got one bomb.
[250:43.14]This looks like the official game.
[250:44.20]Not blow him up.
[250:55.56]How do I blow him up?
[250:58.58]Oh, fuck.
[250:59.08]I was too late.
[251:00.25]Alright, it's time for Macross!
[251:21.28]I'm in... I can't blow up the wall?
[251:24.44]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[251:25.14]Why?
[251:36.58]More like Macross.
[251:38.19]What?
[251:39.53]Eh, this game's boring.
[251:45.39]Macross time.
[251:51.93]Where was it?
[251:57.25]528.
[252:03.67]Macross.
[252:06.69]New start, push.
[252:17.04]That would really hurt your ears, yes.
[252:19.50]Ready Valkyrie 311.
[252:31.49]This is pretty good.
[252:31.93]The ship doesn't move very fast though.
[252:48.47]Wait, this is actually the anime.
[252:51.33]What anime?
[252:52.08]Is it Macross anime?
[252:56.92]Well, that looks weird.
[253:00.58]I don't know what I'm doing, but I guess the world is changing behind us.
[253:04.86]Macross is an anime.
[253:07.56]Attack!
[253:14.05]Is this the intro of Macross?
[253:22.05]Get out of here.
[253:28.49]It's a side-scroller anime.
[253:34.64]P for power.
[253:42.22]Power!
[253:45.46]Total power!
[253:47.82]Power!
[253:56.58]Total Corruption!
[254:04.77]Total Power!
[254:06.43]Total Power!
[254:08.95]Total Power!
[254:10.96]I'm not doing it good tonight.
[254:12.21]I'm not doing it good tonight.
[254:13.63]I usually can do it way better than that.
[254:14.75]I can do it way better than that.
[254:16.81]I'm kind of pissed off of that.
[254:17.99]That's annoying me.
[254:26.13]Actually, that's pissing me off.
[254:29.21]Why is there an HP meter in a shmup?
[254:32.67]Um... Because this is an anime, dude.
[254:35.45]You're watching second episode.
[254:38.30]Why do you think this is a shmup?
[254:50.52]Play TF2, I think it's on 547.
[254:51.80]I just want to fight the second boss.
[255:05.19]You're a schmuck.
[255:10.27]Shmup.
[255:10.67]You're a shmuppet.
[255:11.93]So people that play lots of shmups, would you be called a shmuppet?

[256:26.31]Why are we the ice climbers?
[256:27.87]This is annoying.
[256:28.41]Oh my god.
[256:37.14]Where's that key?
[256:43.00]What is going on in your house, Mickey?
[256:45.32]Your house is fucking insane.
[256:49.13]Call an exterminator.
[256:50.09]Oh, wait.
[256:53.07]The exterminator would get rid of you, too.
[256:54.63]That would not be good.
[257:08.20]You should be able to shoot?
[257:09.88]I just have a jump.
[257:10.56]Alright, I got the key.
[257:13.44]I'm good.

[257:19.22]What do you mean, what were they thinking?
[257:29.10]You have to buy a gun.
[257:30.06]Open the door, what?
[257:37.56]I don't have the key.
[257:45.10]I just got the key, didn't I?
[257:51.53]Wrong door.
[258:00.69]You need the mic key.
[258:02.01]I hate it.
[258:05.45]Okay.
[258:05.98]Let's do a Ghostbusters.
[258:08.30]If this is the original, then this one horrible.
[258:16.20]Yes, it is.
[258:16.96]This is so bad.
[258:26.88]I don't... What the hell is going on?
[258:34.86]You need a beam!
[258:36.28]Holy shit, man.
[258:58.29]AVGM See it's just a bunch of donkey turds.
[259:06.36]This is a fucking ball sack full of donkey ass This eats more shit than a fucking donkey's ass The original video game YouTuber pretty much
[259:30.12]I think I've watched a majority of his first 100 or 200 videos right over there.
[259:48.66]He's still going, isn't he?
[259:52.07]Hey, he's been around longer than all of us.
[260:00.46]Are we pushing the car because it ran out of gas?
[260:04.64]He's immortal.
[260:09.73]Why are we pushing the car?
[260:15.07]Fill it up.
[260:17.97]I got his autograph once at a con.
[260:19.48]He's a genuinely nice guy.
[260:20.98]Oh, I'm sure he is.
[260:21.90]He's like... He's funny too.
[260:31.27]You need a beam.
[260:32.03]What do I get out of this shop?
[260:32.83]Oh my god.
[260:38.75]I don't want to do this anymore.
[260:51.05]You're supposed to run over the barrels.
[260:53.95]I'm afraid to touch it.
[260:54.89]I have $9,700.
[260:56.41]Somebody said the Ghostbusters are broke.
[260:57.81]I have like $10,000.
[261:03.16]And by the way, 10 grand in this, in the car.
[261:06.00]I don't know how much is in their bank account.
[261:22.71]Fun fact, Huey Lewis sued for the Ghostbusters song.
[261:25.13]Yeah, and he won.
[261:25.63]You gotta add that part too.
[261:27.47]He won that lawsuit.
[261:35.96]Only 200 meters to go.
[261:37.62]Almost there.
[261:39.36]Oh no.
[261:45.14]I'm not doing this anymore.
[261:48.31]We're going somewhere else.
[261:57.87]Okay.
[261:58.23]We did boot cat.
[262:00.98]Aladdin 3.
[262:01.62]Okay.
[262:14.20]A side scroller?
[262:15.04]This is the... The Landry Revenge of Jafar.
[262:30.49]Yeah.
[262:32.03]This is what they came up with.
[262:34.01]For the game.
[262:34.49]Wouldn't that shit write to DVD?
[262:41.55]You can always tell what Disney movies to not watch when it was just in the bin at your local Blockbuster.
[262:47.17]They didn't put it out on the rack to rent.
[262:48.57]It was just in the bin.
[262:49.83]It's like, ah, probably not going to get that one.
[262:51.89]I don't really want to watch that one.
[262:53.12]I've never seen it.
[262:53.66]Oh my god.
[263:07.34]Do you know that Cinderella 3 exists?
[263:10.58]Uh, yeah, yeah.
[263:11.59]I mean, I feel like that could have happened to Shrek, but it was too popular for them to put it into, like, the Walmart bin.
[263:27.42]The universe sold.
[263:29.00]Oh.
[263:33.58]I thought we were going to be buying and selling planets and stuff.
[263:40.51]Just easy and hard.
[263:41.69]Okay.
[263:42.03]I don't... What character am I?
[263:49.64]Oh, it's Pac-Man, but... This song is pretty sick, though.
[263:55.38]This is a great song.
[263:56.34]It's not very hard.
[264:16.30]It's toxic.
[264:17.00]No, it is not.
[264:17.70]Nice try though.
[264:19.10]What's the star do?
[264:41.02]That was a fake.
[264:41.72]That was a fake guy.
[264:42.84]It was a fake apple.
[264:44.80]Now you pissed me off.
[264:52.95]You pissed me off.
[264:54.37]You pissed me off.
[264:56.31]You pissed me off.
[264:57.17]You pissed me off.
[264:59.27]You pissed me off.
[265:01.86]You pissed me off.
[265:05.18]Quick trivia.
[265:05.92]What is that from?
[265:08.48]Quick trivia.
[265:16.90]Are there any Jerma985 YouTube fans in here?
[265:21.26]I guess there's none.
[265:22.76]I guess there's zero people.
[265:24.75]Zero fans of Jerma985's YouTube channel.
[265:27.85]Zero fans here.
[265:29.49]Thought I had a few fans in here.
[265:31.49]Thought I had a few people that were like fans of the channel.
[265:35.01]Okay.
[265:37.01]Ooh.
[265:43.00]Fuck off.
[265:45.71]Somebody was looking for this one earlier.
[265:46.79]Twimby.
[265:58.62]You pissed me off.
[265:59.96]You pissed me off.
[266:02.02]Really?
[266:02.30]Play Sly Cooper.
[266:14.37]I don't know.
[266:14.83]Maybe.
[266:15.57]I tried and I just didn't want to play.
[266:17.23]My PS3 was like burning.
[266:19.87]So I just didn't do it.
[266:21.21]I tried to get an emulator and the emulator looked like shit.
[266:23.16]So I gave up.
[266:28.30]I actually loaded up Sly Cooper on the PlayStation 3, the remastered version.
[266:32.76]My PS3 started to smell like burning plastic.
[266:35.85]So I had to turn it off.
[266:36.83]It was giving me a headache.
[266:45.97]Buy a new one.
[266:46.93]Yeah, I know.
[266:47.61]But I... Look, I've been busy.
[266:49.99]They're on Steam.
[267:00.35]Sly Cooper's not on Steam.
[267:04.91]PS3 emulator that I had, I tried so many settings, but it just looked so awfully scan-lined and artifacted.
[267:12.19]There was a ton of ghosting every time I would move around.
[267:15.47]There was input lag on the controller.
[267:17.21]It was a mess.
[267:18.29]I tried.
[267:18.73]I tried so many things to get it to not look horrible.
[267:27.12]Please get the bells, dude.
[267:39.47]See, 28,000.
[267:39.87]28,000.
[267:39.89]That's the amount of community subs I will give if I get hit in the next one full second.
[267:46.42]One.
[267:47.60]Thank God.
[267:52.26]We're good.
[268:13.82]Hey!
[268:20.17]I was actually doing okay and then I started laughing at something.
[268:30.01]That's fun.
[268:32.90]Do you still care about me if I'm new and don't know all your old jokes?
[268:39.72]Yeah, you don't have to know.
[268:40.44]I mean, there's 10,000 people there.
[268:42.77]I figured one person would have seen Raven's Cry.
[268:48.21]Minute number three, second number like eight in the video.
[268:56.09]You pissed me off!
[268:57.63]I can't- I'm just surprised there's not- there's 10,000 of you here.
[269:03.10]How about, um... Colorful Dragon.
[269:08.26]Oh, this dragon is absolutely fucking zonked.
[269:15.65]Why do they all have to be this?
[269:18.25]Hop down, collect things.
[269:30.04]Do I pick anything?
[269:30.68]What am I supposed to do?
[269:34.81]Is that a bite?
[269:43.43]What is the goal?
[269:48.94]Step on each one of these?
[269:52.12]Lay an egg on those?
[269:52.92]Game sucks.
[270:05.57]Alright.
[270:06.47]I have to play Castle Excellent.
[270:08.97]Wait, did I do this yesterday?
[270:14.96]Castle Excellent.
[270:18.56]Play RoboCop?
[270:19.22]We did all the RoboCops yesterday.
[270:23.18]We did all the RoboCops yesterday.
[270:24.92]And they were insane.
[270:29.24]Oh my god, damn it.
[270:34.76]Asshole awful.
[270:43.83]How do I attack?
[270:45.03]Wait, I can only attack if I'm moving.
[270:51.21]Jesus.
[270:53.29]Why?
[270:55.45]He has a fucking bow and arrow.
[270:56.49]I'm done.
[271:02.32]Holy shit, this is the best comment I've seen all night.
[271:06.18]Snorty, I gotta shout your name out here.
[271:09.90]This is the best, this is unbelievable reference here.
[271:12.41]It said, you're playing dish satellite games.
[271:18.45]Holy shit, that's unbelievably accurate.
[271:26.29]It's unbelievable.
[271:28.36]What a great, what an unbelievable reference.
[271:37.09]I think we're running out of material here.
[271:41.18]What should I play?
[271:42.06]Have we really gone through all 600 of these fucking things?
[271:48.44]We've done almost all of them.
[271:57.88]Bruce Lee.
[271:58.28]We did Bruce Lee 2.
[271:59.10]470.
[271:59.50]Which one?
[272:08.12]Pon Pon Valley?
[272:09.06]I think we did this.
[272:09.58]How about Buggy Popper?
[272:19.30]Oh, that was going to be like popping bugs, like insects.
[272:22.35]Not the actual vehicle, but okay.
[272:23.99]Let's go.
[272:30.47]What is wrong with this car?
[272:37.80]Nothing wrong with your transmission, dude.
[272:39.36]Holy shit, where did all these cars come from?
[272:45.34]Wait, did I just jump him?
[272:49.81]Wait, why is my character doing that?
[272:52.97]I guess it is called Buggy Hopper?
[272:57.39]I'm not pressing a button to do that.
[272:58.67]It's just randomly happening.
[273:10.81]Holy shit.
[273:13.89]Good thing I got a warning.
[273:14.79]Oh, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes.
[273:21.44]Made it.
[273:21.90]We're good.
[273:22.20]Do I need to be in first place or something or just survive?
[273:32.87]I have no idea.
[273:45.03]What?
[273:47.48]Under repair- Oh.
[273:48.82]I'm plugged into a wall socket?
[273:51.40]Oh man, that front looked pretty fucking sus to me.
[273:53.22]I know.
[274:15.47]I know.
[274:15.79]I know.
[274:16.81]I know.
[274:17.73]I shouldn't have.
[274:20.77]I know.
[274:21.99]All tasks completed.
[274:23.22]I have to say it though.
[274:26.32]All tasks completed.
[274:29.04]What the fuck did I just miss?
[274:36.07]This guy sucks.
[274:38.95]Great, you crashed 14 cars.
[274:41.07]Why is that a great thing?
[274:42.42]Shouldn't that be like a... Be more careful next time?
[274:45.76]That's a great job.
[274:55.34]They're all crashing into the wall.
[274:57.40]Can they not jump?
[274:58.44]That seems sort of unfair.
[274:59.56]I'm the only one with a buggy popper?
[275:10.31]Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.
[275:17.38]Is he pretending to be this bad?
[275:19.94]I haven't lost once.
[275:23.70]Fucking whatever.
[275:24.46]Dino Reekie?
[275:41.10]South Park character.
[275:43.55]It's like Clyde from South Park.
[275:48.25]I like this one so far.
[275:48.95]Hey, look, Chad.
[275:54.65]It's you.
[275:55.07]Dude, that's you right there.
[276:08.08]Yeah, it's you.
[276:08.97]It looks just like you.
[276:18.66]I don't want this kind of speed.
[276:20.04]Ooh, nice.
[276:29.48]Diamonds.
[276:29.84]Oh, this game's fun, but it's just hard to control.
[276:32.04]Remember, this isn't comedy.
[276:35.42]This is warfare.
[276:36.18]Didn't even know you could jump.
[276:41.55]I don't even want to play it anymore.
[276:48.24]Is this Toho?
[276:48.88]Is this Toohu?
[276:56.53]Wait.
[276:57.79]No.
[276:59.81]Cosmos Cup.
[277:01.63]Bar games.
[277:03.23]Absolutely.
[277:04.59]Oh, this is a casino.
[277:06.13]For amusement only.
[277:09.50]Not for real money.
[277:10.64]Good thing they told us.
[277:13.66]Alright, let's go.
[277:19.19]I won.
[277:20.61]Holy shit, I just won the whole thing.
[277:24.75]I just won the whole thing.
[277:26.43]I beat the whole game.
[277:30.13]Big win.
[277:33.54]How much did I win?
[277:51.45]I didn't have a bed in.
[278:01.22]Not fun.
[278:01.52]I was watching the demo.
[278:09.61]What do we got?
[278:10.11]I saw another one I wanted.
[278:12.77]Cosmos Cop.
[278:14.93]This one looks good.
[278:20.92]A-2010, the terror legion from alienation space.
[278:26.32]Invaded galaxy.
[278:29.22]Universal Defense Headquarters.
[278:32.71]Detached Cosmos Cup.
[278:34.77]To destroy them.
[278:38.77]Mission 1.
[278:40.19]Cross over outside defense area.
[278:52.91]Pretty fun.
[278:54.27]It's just that other game we played.
[278:55.39]It's just that SEGA game.
[279:11.36]Space Harrier?
[279:14.08]P.
[279:20.15]It's making the noise that I feel like the dentist tools make if they touch the wrong part of your tooth.
[279:29.02]Anybody get that?
[279:32.76]Ah!
[279:35.26]Yeah, I hate it.
[279:36.20]It's just that they are doing the drill and they move a little too close to the tooth or a different side of the tooth and it makes that... I can't hear this anymore.
[279:45.95]Ah, fuck.
[279:52.06]I gotta leave.
[279:53.98]Firehouse rescue.
[280:06.43]Get on the ladder.
[280:07.89]I've shaved you.
[280:08.59]Okay, let's go.
[280:14.31]Let's rescue somebody.
[280:21.19]We have to go to the house, but do I need gas first?
[280:26.79]You have a really elaborate driveway.
[280:38.22]It's just a cat.
[280:40.60]Alright, get on.
[280:45.64]Rescue complete.

[281:15.15]Oh, come on out.
[281:19.59]Everybody left?
[281:24.10]When's the jump scare gonna happen?
[281:30.21]This game is for actual babies.
[281:33.33]Yeah.
[281:35.43]I mean, the splash screen had Fisher Price on it.
[281:42.61]I don't think there's gonna be very much thought involved in this.
[281:56.27]What happens if you don't rescue them?
[281:58.69]Do they just stay in there?
[282:01.53]What is the danger in this house?
[282:08.04]Are we practicing?
[282:10.84]They die.
[282:12.30]What's the danger?
[282:12.90]There's no fire?
[282:13.60]There's no... What if there's a gas leak?

[285:21.04]Get him out of here.
[285:22.86]What does that mean?
[285:24.90]Did he get into the town?
[285:25.77]He's climbing up the ladder.
[285:27.19]This is actually kind of scary.
[285:29.45]Get out of here.
[285:31.35]How do I get him?
[285:41.50]Oh shit.
[285:42.18]Don't let him up to the magic rock.
[285:47.52]Is that like our family stone or our family meat?
[286:00.31]Don't let him up.
[286:04.43]It's the communal ham.
[286:06.57]Isn't that shit in Dr. Seuss?
[286:11.13]Don't they eat a giant communal ham in that movie?
[286:14.01]In that book and everything, whatever.
[286:21.51]The Grinch.
[286:31.80]The Rose Beast.
[286:32.56]Yeah, it feeds the whole town, right?
[286:48.14]Oh shit, he's going fast!
[286:52.90]Oh my god, he's taking the communal ham.
[286:54.46]How do we stop him?
[286:56.13]How do we stop him from stealing that?
[287:02.35]No, he can't do it.
[287:02.99]It's like a little dog that gets a huge bone.
[287:05.15]He can't walk anywhere with it.
[287:06.59]Uh-oh.
[287:13.29]They couldn't push it off.
[287:17.19]No!
[287:19.85]Do I win?
[287:26.28]Wait, they're gonna kill you.
[287:27.42]Wait, they're gonna drop the communal ham on my head?
[287:29.80]Oh my god, they're gonna drop the communal ham.
[287:37.50]Fuck, I'm dead.
[287:38.14]I kinda want to do it.
[287:49.24]I kinda want to see what happens.
[287:51.02]I want to see what happens.
[287:53.12]Let's see what happens when they drop the communal ham on me.
[287:56.06]Oh, fuck you.

[292:42.67]Violent chasing.
[292:43.88]Okay.
[292:58.80]It's just the pathing for SimCity.
[293:02.57]You just follow the cars around like this is horrible.

[296:05.22]They're gonna fall?
[296:07.12]I don't understand.
[296:10.38]Oh, I have to... I can change the direction.

[297:46.83]I saw Jay Leno and I just had to start doing it.
[297:52.90]Jay Leno is the easiest voice to do.
[297:57.60]It's just... you just move around and just... go like that!
[298:00.96]This person's house is on fire.
[298:12.75]What do I do?
[298:15.93]Oh.
[298:21.00]The person just... wait, this person just dropped a fucking missile on me.
[298:32.89]Get in, get in, get in, get in, get in!
[298:35.53]Get in!
[298:38.08]Wait, I don't wanna... Is it gonna hurt?

[298:54.69]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

[299:07.20]I did it, okay?
[299:08.06]I saved everybody.
[299:09.94]It's just the same game over and over again with a different spot that they walk out of.
[299:14.48]Alright, three more and I'm done.
[299:21.10]And this thing's going right into the recycling.

[300:51.31]It's not really false advertising.
[300:54.75]The name of the game is just called Star.
[300:58.59]So, it's not like this is a problem or anything.
[301:10.51]I'm growing.
[301:11.05]Does that mean anything?
[301:15.59]Background is making me sick.

[304:40.59]This one looks hard.
[304:54.92]Oof.
[304:58.47]I'm going to split too.
[304:59.75]That's it for that one.
[305:03.09]Alright, where are we going?
[305:03.94]Final one.
[305:04.60]Last one of the night.
[305:06.46]And then this thing's going away.
[305:07.52]It was fun to play them though.
[305:11.94]I'm glad I played it.

[306:24.19]That's so stupid.
[306:32.62]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[306:35.44]I want nothing to do with this one.
[306:38.74]I thought this was going to be an adventure game where you go around the tombs and stuff.
[306:53.33]Alright, what's the actual last one?
[306:54.37]3034 was robbed.
[307:01.75]334 was robbed.

[307:51.85]It's a math game.
[307:53.91]Do you hear Otto?
[307:56.75]He's like, hey...
[307:58.95]How is this a 22 divided by 170?
[308:00.40]What is that there for?
[308:05.98]What is that?
[308:06.52]Why is there a math problem over there?
[308:12.21]What the hell is the point of this?
[308:14.47]If I stab him, does the number come out?
[308:26.61]This is freaking terrible.

[311:37.04]How much is left in the debt?
[311:39.20]Um, what is the actual official debt?
[311:41.62]It was $2.5 billion, and then I added like $2 billion, right?
[311:46.04]So it was like $4.5 billion or something.
[311:50.55]So now it should be down to 3.
[311:53.35]Or like 2.8 or something.
[311:59.37]Or 3 billion.
