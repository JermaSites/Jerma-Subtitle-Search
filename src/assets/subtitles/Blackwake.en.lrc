[01:33.93]Hello!
[01:35.67]Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to a very special, a very special stream.
[01:40.37]Get the wind in the background and watch your hair, watch your hat, make sure your hat doesn't fly off.
[01:47.26]I'm Jerma.
[01:48.36]Good to see you.
[01:50.94]It's pretty windy up here in outer space, you know, no big deal.
[01:53.64]A little windy.
[01:58.32]Hey, somebody just subscribed!
[02:00.08]Lethal Spoon!
[02:02.55]Cool!
[02:03.19]Thanks, dude.
[02:04.08]Thanks for the 12 months.
[02:04.76]Let me just make a tweet saying I'm playing a game.
[02:09.52]And we'll get going.
[02:10.72]You know.
[02:12.68]You know how we do this, right?
[02:17.16]Streaming Black Wake tonight.
[02:22.43]This is a pirate game.
[02:23.41]It's like a multiplayer pirate game.
[02:24.85]I have no idea.
[02:25.57]I have no clue how this game is or we're gonna try it.
[02:28.41]We don't know.
[02:28.73]Whatever.
[02:32.84]Is there a pirate emote?
[02:33.84]I mean, there's this.
[02:36.51]Okay, that's good enough.
[02:42.37]So, Etalyx may or may not be joining us tonight.
[02:46.47]Not sure.
[02:47.03]Hold on, let me just make this tweet, and now here we go.
[02:53.51]Alright, so... There's a couple of reasons why this is a special stream tonight.
[03:01.17]You'll see in a minute.
[03:04.33]Let's move to the game.
[03:07.85]Turn this off.
[03:10.06]Here we are.
[03:10.76]Okay.
[03:13.52]So, Blackwake, I guess, is a pirate, first-person shooter, team-based multiplayer game.
[03:22.38]Now, there's the pirate emotes.
[03:23.66]There they are.
[03:24.72]But what makes this stream more interesting, what makes this stream in particular more interesting, is this.
[03:34.03]You see, ladies and gentlemen, for every single time we went around in this game.
[03:40.91]Got something special here to show you.
[03:43.71]For every time we went around in this game, you're going to get treated to a Buffy the Vampire Slayer Mad Lib.
[03:53.26]That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:55.00]Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
[03:58.24]Jeremy's favorite TV show of all time.
[04:03.54]Every single victory!
[04:05.22]We're gonna open this up, we're gonna do a Madlib together.
[04:07.86]What do you think about that?
[04:13.22]We'll do that soon.
[04:15.84]I'll see you in a few minutes.
[04:20.08]Etalyx actually might show up.
[04:22.72]I don't know.
[04:23.84]Who knows at this point.
[04:25.62]He had some dog problems.
[04:27.42]Wait, what?
[04:30.23]Hold on one second.
[05:15.25]Oh, okay.
[05:16.85]Yeah, so, we're gonna do Buffy the Mad... Buffy the Mad Lib Vampire Slayer.
[05:21.65]After every, uh... After every victory.
[05:26.49]So, it's gonna be fun.
[05:28.91]I have no idea how we're gonna make a character.
[05:30.51]There's only, like, four faces.
[05:32.05]Like, who gives a shit, right?
[05:35.92]Uh... I'm, like, pretty white.
[05:38.26]So, I feel like it's gotta be white.

[06:25.33]Okay, hats.
[06:26.09]No, I can't... All I can do is just be like a dirty old man.
[06:29.15]That's fine.
[06:29.57]Alright, whatever.
[06:31.85]Uh, servers... We're just gonna hop in a server?
[06:37.87]There's 54 fucking people played this game?
[06:42.54]It's 53 out of 54?
[06:46.20]Are you shitting me?
[06:48.80]Okay.
[06:50.36]We're gonna fight.
[06:52.38]I want to play in a server with that many people.
[06:54.37]This is gonna be fucking total carnage.
[07:00.09]There's a lot of fucking people play this game.
[07:01.93]Hide empty, hide full.
[07:05.49]That's too... Ping's too high.
[07:08.81]What's with all this high ping bullshit?
[07:12.74]This is like an EU server.
[07:13.72]Why are these all EU?
[07:16.39]Max ping 100.
[07:18.77]Refresh.
[07:20.47]Oh, okay.
[07:21.73]Come on, give us like a huge server.
[07:26.59]We're aware of issues connecting.
[07:28.03]It seems full servers are not properly showing as full.
[07:31.61]Okay, well, whatever.
[07:34.01]Are we gonna have to just go in an EU server?
[07:35.41]We might.
[07:39.31]Yeah, we're gonna have to go in EU, I think.
[07:41.19]We're just going in this one.
[07:43.71]TDM fleet, connect.
[07:46.65]I have no fucking idea what's going on.
[07:48.27]I have no idea how to fall- GOD, THIS IS SO LOUD!
[07:52.24]WHY IS THIS- WHY?!
[07:54.54]WHY IS THIS THIS LOUD?!
[07:55.80]ALREADY, EVERY GAME!
[07:57.40]Doesn't matter, are we gonna- do you wanna be the British, or do you wanna be the dead people?
[08:01.04]Are we gonna be the dead people?
[08:02.20]OH MY GOD!
[08:06.41]What is this?! !
[08:10.91]My fucking god.
[08:12.95]Why?
[08:15.21]There's no reason for that shit.
[08:18.14]Flying spaghetti.
[08:19.00]Alright, I'm joining the flying spaghetti.
[08:22.36]Okay.
[08:23.50]I don't have any weapons.
[08:25.78]Where's my- I have no weapons.
[08:27.32]Alright, I got a hammer.
[08:30.76]I do have a hammer.
[08:33.48]I can repair this.
[08:36.68]Do you have a- This guy's holding like a sawed-off shotgun.
[08:43.17]Alright, I repaired the sill.
[08:44.27]I did something.
[08:45.83]What else do I need to do?
[08:47.33]Repair this.
[08:51.27]That's fine.
[08:52.07]Let's do this for a few minutes.
[08:53.35]Alright, that looks good.
[08:56.53]Alright, now I'm in the cannon.
[08:58.09]No, I need powder.
[09:01.03]Gunpowder.
[09:01.67]Okay.
[09:03.01]Somebody take my brick of gunpowder right in here.
[09:07.11]Alright.
[09:08.11]Here we go.
[09:12.45]It's ready.
[09:15.12]How do we fire it?
[09:17.48]Nice shot.
[09:18.86]What do I do with this tiki torch?
[09:25.39]Ramming?
[09:26.41]Push it up?
[09:26.93]Should we be pushing this?
[09:29.81]I guess we should probably have done the tutorial, huh?
[09:33.72]Alright, let's go with the musket.
[09:48.72]Oh shit, the thing is sinking.
[09:50.78]We're sinking.
[09:52.06]Was that just me?
[09:52.96]I think that was me.
[09:55.52]Wait, hold on.
[09:57.73]We're okay.
[09:58.17]We're okay.
[09:58.93]We're okay.
[10:01.37]How do I steer the boat?
[10:08.66]This guy doesn't even give a shit.
[10:12.26]This guy's still going.
[10:13.84]What the fuck?
[10:16.90]So we sank, but that doesn't mean we can't fucking... Watch this one.
[10:21.97]This guy's still repairing something.
[10:26.91]Wait, that's me.
[10:29.71]That's me doing that, right?
[10:31.19]Like, dude, you can't...
[10:41.45]It's still alive.
[10:53.93]Where have I?
[10:54.79]Are we on a new boat?
[10:56.54]Alright, so I'm assuming... Who steers?
[11:02.06]Let me be... I'm gonna be the fucking captain.
[11:04.94]I'm the new captain.
[11:05.76]I'm using.
[11:06.48]No.
[11:06.74]Alright, well you use it.
[11:07.68]Let me use it.
[11:10.61]We're coming into the port right now.
[11:13.25]I wanna man a ship and just start slashing, you know what I'm saying?
[11:18.25]Get us up there.
[11:21.20]Yeah, does anybody need any fish?
[11:24.78]Anybody need any cannonballs?
[11:26.94]Alright, cannonball.
[11:28.18]Can I... Oh, please tell me I can bash somebody in the skull with this.
[11:32.90]Right here.
[11:33.64]Uh, swivel it.
[11:35.54]Watch this one.
[11:36.92]You know, this is why they called me the fucking scout killer.
[11:39.18]I'm not even the right game.
[11:41.70]How high did I just shoot that?
[11:42.92]What's the drop like on this thing?
[11:48.74]I can't even tell.
[11:50.53]Oh, I just lagged.
[11:55.39]Well, that guy's gone.
[11:56.67]That guy's gone.
[11:57.15]That guy was having fun doing a balancing act, and now he's gone.
[12:01.33]Getting chickens.
[12:02.17]Who's getting a chicken?
[12:07.91]Oh, that was a direct hit.
[12:10.42]That was a direct hit.
[12:11.09]Let's see if we can sink this motherfucker.
[12:16.45]Ooh!
[12:17.11]Tearing some cloth right now.
[12:20.72]Whoever is driving the ship is doing a serious good job.
[12:24.28]We need to keep turning, though.
[12:25.12]Come on.
[12:25.56]Turn it more.
[12:25.92]Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[12:32.54]Can you turn us anymore with the front?
[12:34.14]Alright, whatever.
[12:34.54]I'm gonna get off this.
[12:36.24]I'm gonna move to the other one.
[12:37.38]Get off.
[12:38.74]How do I get off?
[12:39.72]There we go.
[12:39.96]Alright, here we go.
[12:42.02]Put this in.
[12:43.78]That one's in.
[12:44.64]Alright, give it a light.
[12:46.58]Give it a look.
[12:49.04]Nice shot.
[12:49.60]Alright, get me on my boat.
[12:51.71]Get up close so I can get up there.
[12:57.83]Why is this boat so much bigger than ours?
[13:04.00]Why do I feel like this needs to be named?
[13:05.74]Ow.
[13:10.43]Zero holes.
[13:11.55]Ship low in water.
[13:15.13]I so badly want to board somebody else's ship, but I don't think that's going to happen.
[13:18.27]We need a captain that's really aggressive.
[13:22.91]We need an aggressive-ass captain.
[13:29.37]Okay, can I do anything in here?
[13:31.19]Can I get some snacks?
[13:32.17]Can I bring snacks to my friends?
[13:35.69]Oh, starboard, starboard, starboard, starboard, starboard.
[13:43.30]I want to get back on this.
[13:45.18]Like over here.
[13:45.66]There we go.
[13:51.77]Oh, I just barely missed.
[13:59.29]Surprisingly for an early access game, this is running well.
[14:02.36]This is running more than 60 FPS.
[14:08.02]I'm about to go in the water and just do a fucking secret mission and just kill the whole ship.
[14:13.76]You know what I mean?
[14:16.61]Alright, there we go.
[14:17.99]Straight ahead.
[14:18.65]Full speed ahead.
[14:22.41]You get me on that ship.
[14:23.71]I'm telling you right now.
[14:26.13]I'm telling you right now.
[14:26.77]You pull up to that boat.
[14:27.53]I'm jumping in and I'm going to get on there and I'm going to fucking slay.
[14:30.71]I'm going to slay just like my favorite TV show.
[14:33.72]Buffy the Vampire Slay.
[14:36.32]Come on.
[14:38.10]Come on!
[14:39.47]Come on!
[14:39.85]How long can I be in the waterfall?
[14:40.97]Go!
[14:43.73]Here we go!
[14:46.41]Oh shit!
[14:46.73]That guy's gonna board our ship!
[14:53.80]No he isn't!
[14:59.27]What the fuck?
[15:01.69]I can't... I can't climb the edge of their ship?
[15:07.01]And why can I still hear the captain?
[15:09.56]This far away?
[15:10.34]I'm very clearly in the water.
[15:19.34]Turns out it's hard to climb above.
[15:22.25]I haven't respawned, I'm fine.
[15:23.65]Oh shit.
[15:36.52]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[15:45.03]That wasn't supposed to happen.
[15:48.19]No, fuck off!
[15:56.41]Why did that guy just turn into a scarecrow?
[16:03.14]That guy turned into a scarecrow.
[16:07.00]Holy shit.
[16:15.31]Okay, I don't think that would happen if you got hit by a cannonball, by the way.
[16:19.39]If somebody hits you with a cannonball from that far away, you're... You're not gonna fly away like Team Rocket.
[16:28.50]You're not going to come.
[16:29.38]That's not going to happen.
[16:31.49]I kind of just want to watch at this point, man.
[16:33.87]Somebody getting hit with a cannonball is fucking hilarious.
[16:37.87]I got to get up there.
[16:38.91]Somebody else get hit with a cannonball.
[16:41.39]I'll just be here watching.
[16:42.37]I'm going to get a good view.
[16:46.68]Give me a good view.
[16:48.10]How did that guy die?
[16:48.86]Can I use this?
[16:49.52]Oh, here we go.
[16:58.68]Oh shit!
[16:59.24]The captain is dead!
[17:00.18]The captain had a heart attack!
[17:03.38]Oh shit!
[17:03.78]Bring it on!
[17:06.47]Let's go!
[17:08.03]Get down here!
[17:22.38]Oh, I'm gonna fucking destroy this guy.
[17:24.98]One shot.
[17:25.90]Come on.
[17:26.26]He doesn't even have an animation.
[17:27.88]Come on.
[17:28.32]Hurry up.
[17:29.14]What?
[17:37.94]I love this game.
[17:40.84]Something's wrong with that guy.
[17:42.32]That guy's like puking.
[17:48.03]Alright, we're good.
[17:50.01]Somehow we've stayed in this.
[17:52.28]Through thick and thin.
[17:55.80]Uh-oh, watch out, they're coming up on our side of the tide!
[17:59.24]These guys are coming in real fast.
[18:05.26]Come on, let me get like a headshot right here, please.
[18:09.43]Fuck god.
[18:11.87]I just got killed by a guy whose name was Dusty Wizard.
[18:14.27]Oh, okay.
[18:20.08]We're all like... Everyone's like the dusty old man.
[18:26.64]Here we go.
[18:28.36]One, two, three.
[18:30.06]Nope.
[18:32.60]I can't steer it.
[18:33.18]I have to be the captain to steer this.
[18:35.56]That's like, slightly unfair.
[18:42.95]Alright, come on.
[18:43.63]Be brave, you horse's asses.
[18:46.89]Be brave, you pile of shits.
[18:52.47]I can't even tell what the trajectory is, but we're crashing again.
[18:54.69]I'm going for it.
[18:57.57]Get us closer.
[19:00.07]All these guys are dead, you know what I mean?
[19:03.09]You give me an opportunity so I can sprint jump off this thing, and I am going to kill every single person on their boat.
[19:08.41]Every single one.
[19:11.02]Slow it down.
[19:12.62]Let them come.
[19:16.22]This guy just looks like a dirty cowboy.
[19:19.57]That's not like a pirate.
[19:20.47]That's just like a regular guy.
[19:23.19]That just has like a beard.
[19:25.03]With like a t-shirt on.
[19:25.85]Alright, here we go.
[19:26.29]This is it.
[19:30.27]This is it.
[19:30.75]Come on, get close.
[19:33.96]Just get close enough where I can jump on the boat.
[19:35.82]That's all I want.
[19:37.26]I got him.
[19:41.44]I got him.
[19:42.02]I got him.
[19:44.98]Give me this.
[19:45.34]Give me this.
[19:45.64]Give me this.
[19:46.20]Come on.
[19:48.91]Shit!
[19:49.73]Come on!
[19:52.05]Come on!
[19:52.79]Ah, fuck!
[19:56.09]I did get that one guy, though.
[19:57.51]I got that guy right in the back.
[20:01.36]Oh, shit.
[20:05.36]Our fucking captain keeps dying.
[20:07.40]Over and over again.
[20:08.08]Alright, one shot.
[20:11.77]Up here.
[20:18.36]get up there.
[20:20.84]Wait, you can elect captains?
[20:24.14]Ooh, got him.
[20:27.38]Alright, I think I'm starting to get this.
[20:31.98]There's so many bodies here.
[20:34.86]Seriously, everybody wants to be the captain.
[20:37.39]Nobody can be the captain.
[20:38.33]This guy tried too hard to be the captain.
[20:48.35]It just goes to a black screen and tells you that you were shot in the head.
[20:52.54]What is it?
[20:53.32]What is this?
[20:53.74]The Sopranos?
[20:56.28]Hey, what is this?
[20:57.70]You guys want to see some Sopranos action?
[21:00.74]Get over here, motherfucker!
[21:03.38]Christ, go ahead.
[21:04.00]Learn this from The Sopranos.
[21:09.17]Tony.
[21:10.29]Tony Stevenson.
[21:11.37]Whatever his name is.
[21:12.43]Tony Soprano.
[21:33.54]Best captain, the guy at 398th.
[21:39.32]Alright, hey, ladies and gentlemen, that means, you know what that means.
[21:43.93]We have lots of victory, so we're going to do some Mad Libs here.
[21:48.51]Okay, so...
[21:52.65]This is gonna take fucking forever.
[21:54.07]There you go.
[21:55.75]You can read it there.
[21:56.55]There you go.
[21:58.15]This is gonna take like 20 minutes.
[22:01.61]Alright.

[22:18.15]Okay, a noun.
[22:19.17]We need a noun.
[22:25.23]Chili.
[22:26.61]Like a chili pepper, right?
[22:28.73]Adjective.

[22:33.05]Huge.
[22:35.75]Verb ending in "-ing".
[22:37.81]Verb ending in "-ing".

[22:41.35]Dancing.
[22:42.33]Okay.
[22:44.23]Another part of the body.
[22:47.19]Cheek.
[22:48.97]Cheek.
[22:50.07]Letter of the alphabet.
[22:52.51]F. F. Adjective.
[22:56.93]Compact.
[22:58.03]I like that one.
[22:58.67]Compact is a good one.
[23:01.47]We need another noun.
[23:04.84]Streamer.
[23:05.44]Okay, streamer.
[23:08.64]A plural noun.
[23:11.86]Plural noun.
[23:15.84]Edgy.
[23:17.62]We need a number, 131.
[23:18.92]We need another adjective.
[23:23.45]Compact.
[23:24.37]We already did that fucking already.
[23:25.87]We already did compact.
[23:28.91]And noun, pirate.
[23:30.77]Pirate.
[23:31.13]So we need a plural noun.
[23:32.25]We need cookies.
[23:34.43]Cookies.
[23:34.91]Okay, so let's go ahead and read our first Buffy the Vampire Slayer Mad Lib.
[23:39.44]Okay.
[23:42.79]When it comes to matters of the snake, I kinda have a type.
[23:46.88]Pretty.
[23:48.48]Finds my personality more charming than presumptuous.
[23:51.40]Oh.
[23:52.00]And their souls tend to lean a smidge to allot a demon.
[23:54.80]Was this written by a fucking fifth grader?
[23:58.55]Was this written by like a fucking fifth grader?
[24:02.15]I just like spit all over my face.
[24:05.51]First, there was the substitute, Chili, who invited me over to her house for some extracurricular activities.
[24:12.03]Naturally, I thought, my Xander-gets-seduced-by-a-smoking-huge-teacher fantasy was miraculously coming true.
[24:20.91]Turns out she was a giant dancing mantis whose idea of romance was to bite a virgin's cheek off during mating.
[24:27.94]Um, not exactly the way I wanted to lose my F card.
[24:34.14]Then there was the Compact Exchange student slash ink and mummy streamer I fell hard for.
[24:40.64]Didn't realize she had to murder cookies daily to stay young.
[24:45.26]That relationship turned into dust literally when Buffy smashed her 131 hundred year old bones to pieces.
[24:53.48]And of course there was Anya, a vengeance demon who came to Compact Dale to punish me.
[24:59.21]And ended up being the pirate of my life.
[25:01.27]I'm not doing that again.
[25:02.79]That was fucking stupid.
[25:13.12]The Incan mummy streamer.
[25:17.92]Oh, this is different.
[25:23.12]I'm not going to lie.
[25:23.92]I spit up on my face there.
[25:25.44]Because I was laughing at it.
[25:26.61]That's Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
[25:29.76]That was just like an 8th grader's journal.
[25:31.80]You know what I mean?
[25:35.88]We were just looking into the life of a typical 8th grader.
[25:39.68]Oh, I didn't know.
[25:40.24]I don't know if she liked me, but I bit her cheek and I'm not sure.
[25:43.23]Where are we going?
[25:51.35]Oh shit, these people are talking.
[25:54.84]Wait.
[25:58.00]How do I do that?
[26:01.79]I don't know how to do that.
[26:08.25]The sloop that we're aiming at are passing in just one second.
[26:13.91]How do I... I want to say... Oh, God.
[26:16.47]Let me see.
[26:16.81]Melee.
[26:16.97]The sloop right here.
[26:17.63]Oh, my God.
[26:17.91]He's shitting me.
[26:25.40]I heard, like, too many screams.
[26:26.48]One more.
[26:27.38]One more, I think.
[26:27.94]In the cabin.
[26:28.69]Cabin, cabin.
[26:29.61]Oh, God.
[26:29.85]I'm being told what to do.
[26:30.67]I don't know what to do.
[26:31.95]Keep firing.
[26:32.39]I have so much, like, performance anxiety right now.
[26:36.37]And the hole's fixed.
[26:37.78]Like, I want to strike a bottle up to his head, though.
[26:39.52]I'm going to immediately start pumping, and we're going to sink in probably 30 seconds.
[26:44.86]I still need pumping.
[26:46.30]How do I do that?
[26:47.52]What do I do?
[26:49.98]What's happening?
[26:50.86]Okay, we're like dead.
[26:52.74]This boat's... Lookit, this guy's getting in there.
[26:55.78]This dude is glitching into there.
[26:57.86]Come on!
[27:00.00]Okay.
[27:02.30]Ah, fuck.
[27:04.46]I'm sorry, Cap'n.
[27:10.04]Don't lose your F-card.
[27:19.62]Alright, let's try this again.
[27:26.18]Is everyone back and ready?
[27:32.01]Do I have a broken bottle this time?
[27:33.23]I do, thank god.
[27:34.71]That's way more important.
[27:35.87]Alright, let's load this up.
[27:41.09]Cannonball.
[27:41.53]Alright, look.
[27:45.95]I hold R, right mouse to pan.
[27:47.57]Alright.
[27:48.63]Is this thing ready to go?
[27:49.33]I'm not sure.
[27:52.53]I mean, I could aim this.
[27:58.19]Oh, V is for... Okay.
[28:01.55]Let's see if they can hear me.
[28:03.75]Alright.
[28:07.77]You got it, Captain.
[28:20.03]I'm gonna be, like, wicked supportive.
[28:24.29]You guys wanna see?
[28:25.96]You wanna see how supportive I can be?
[28:29.80]Watch out, man.
[28:30.28]You don't wanna be up there that fast.
[28:34.66]You don't wanna be up there.
[28:35.92]Oh, he disappeared.
[28:36.62]Alright, now...
[28:50.13]Look at that.
[28:50.45]Let's lighten up.
[28:51.27]Somebody shot.
[28:52.40]Somebody gave away our position.
[28:57.68]Get ready.
[28:58.40]Left side.
[28:58.72]Left side.
[28:59.06]Get ready.
[29:00.30]Command one of four guns.
[29:06.17]Wait.
[29:06.61]Open fire left side.
[29:09.59]Fire left side.
[29:13.87]I did it.
[29:19.84]Get ready.
[29:20.18]Right side.
[29:21.07]Turn right.
[29:23.37]Switch to right cannons.
[29:26.31]Ready.
[29:26.61]Everyone get on the right side.
[29:29.41]Not your left.
[29:30.87]I'm on the right side, right?
[29:34.35]Right side.
[29:34.85]Oh, baby!
[29:35.27]Alright, get the pumps going.
[29:37.68]Open.
[29:37.88]Open.
[29:48.38]Oh no, Captain's dead.
[29:49.22]Where's the pump?
[29:50.44]Pump.
[29:51.10]Pumping.
[29:52.11]Pumping.
[29:54.35]My screen's all red.
[30:02.97]I think I spilled some fruit juice off.
[30:09.38]I bought it.
[30:09.90]Hold on.
[30:12.16]These guys probably can't even find it.
[30:15.04]Get ready.
[30:15.37]Left side.
[30:15.73]Quickly.
[30:16.03]Quickly.
[30:16.31]Through that.
[30:24.79]Help him fire.
[30:26.75]Let him fire.
[30:32.46]Fire.
[30:32.66]Got it.
[30:35.16]I did good.
[30:35.70]I did good.
[30:36.16]I was the only one that listened.
[30:37.42]I did good.
[30:40.70]Everybody can... I was the one that did good.
[30:43.00]I hit the ship.
[30:43.70]It was me.
[30:45.00]Fix holes.
[30:47.26]Fix holes.
[30:47.62]We can't... Until the holes are fixed.
[30:51.28]Where's my repair thing?
[30:53.28]I'm holding a cartoon bomb.
[30:59.48]Why did I not throw the cartoon bomb?
[31:04.11]Are we good?
[31:19.03]Yeah, I so badly want to hold down V again and be like, God, I think I spilled something.
[31:22.30]I keep wiping my screen, but I can't... I keep wiping my screen!
[31:26.34]But there's still, like, juice on it.
[31:27.56]What happened?
[31:30.16]Until this guy's like, dude, will you shut the fuck up?
[31:34.18]Are we good on the pumping?
[31:38.40]Alright, once we get close enough, I'm gonna throw the cartoon bomb at them.
[31:53.17]Sales, please.
[31:57.27]Alright, what about the swivel?
[31:58.55]No.
[31:59.03]Too far away.
[32:00.57]I got a drink to heal.
[32:01.67]Do I have a drink?
[32:06.36]Where is that?
[32:06.86]Is it somewhere I don't know?
[32:13.78]Why are these guys inside of each other?
[32:15.72]I can't do that, sales.
[32:16.76]Like, we're not supposed to be there.
[32:20.10]Get ready for this car.
[32:30.29]Why can I not light the cartoon bomb?
[32:33.03]I was trying to light it and it didn't do anything.
[32:35.58]Oh, fuck.
[32:37.02]That's how you light it.
[32:42.24]Too far away.
[32:45.56]Drink my tea.
[32:46.38]How do I- where is it?
[32:46.98]That's a hammer.
[32:52.88]That's a bomb.
[32:54.44]That's a broken bottle.
[32:58.86]I don't know how to do it.
[33:03.16]Leave, run, crouch.
[33:04.62]Main, secondary, melee, repair, use.
[33:08.66]Boip, captain commands, run.
[33:11.34]I have tea?
[33:15.04]Pirates don't drink tea.
[33:16.04]You guys are lying to me.
[33:18.78]Keep pumping the water until it goes away.
[33:21.74]The game tells you when there's no more water to pump.
[33:25.33]I got it, I'm on it.
[33:25.97]Roger!
[33:26.13]Fuck.
[33:26.33]I don't know what that means.
[33:52.90]Just need one on anti-cells.
[33:54.00]Everyone else on cannons.
[33:56.08]Switch to left side cannons.
[33:57.28]Left side cannons.
[33:58.00]I don't know if that's what this means.
[34:00.68]Everyone on left side cannons.
[34:01.72]We're going to fire in five seconds.
[34:03.40]I'm fucking killing this guy right now.
[34:05.14]Three.
[34:06.09]Two.
[34:06.81]One.
[34:07.03]Fire.
[34:10.81]I only saw one shot.
[34:12.31]Nice.
[34:12.57]We got him.
[34:14.89]Ready right side.
[34:24.85]I can't even tell my crew to be shot.
[34:26.57]Sorry.
[34:26.95]I'm telling them to fire and I hear one go.
[34:29.38]I don't know.
[34:33.90]I feel like this has got too serious.
[34:36.22]There's an indicator at the top of the screen that says that, you know, we're sinking.
[34:44.09]I at least shot one shot.
[34:48.83]So pumping.
[34:52.14]Oh, here they come.
[34:56.46]Oh, here they come.
[34:59.94]This time we're a fucking brawl!
[35:08.69]Two more.
[35:14.91]What blew us up?
[35:18.69]Now it's time for a mutiny.
[35:28.15]Wait, they're on my side?
[35:29.37]What are you talking about?
[35:31.71]Wait, this is team?
[35:32.65]Fuck.
[35:32.83]I thought it was every man for himself.
[35:42.34]I thought it was every man for himself.
[35:55.84]We don't get to do an ad-lib, by the way.
[36:00.60]We don't get to do an ad-lib.
[36:04.43]We have to win.
[36:05.05]Alright, I'm gonna join the Piracy.
[36:08.57]We're going like the Mighty Wang.
[36:15.77]Somebody's rack or ship pirates.
[36:18.90]Somebody make... Go to the other faction.
[36:21.02]Do you have like better names on this faction?
[36:29.59]Alright.
[36:31.73]Scrub cabin boys or dirty tank.
[36:34.49]I mean, I guess we're going to have to join cabin boys.
[36:42.18]Yes, I would like to nominate myself to be the captain.
[36:45.56]Your captain rating is 6%.
[36:46.42]It is highly recommended for captains to have a microphone.
[36:51.34]I didn't get to even get elected.
[36:53.12]Where was the... Where...
[36:56.35]Excuse me, where's the election there?
[36:58.37]Wait, am I not even... Can anyone hear me?
[37:01.67]What's... Where am I?
[37:04.58]What's going on?
[37:05.84]Oh.
[37:08.94]Alright.
[37:10.46]Um... Captain.
[37:15.13]Let's go with the... Skip the bottle.

[37:20.37]Sorry, guys.
[37:23.55]And health beverage, okay.
[37:25.89]How do I use this?
[37:26.57]There really is tea.
[37:30.73]Alright guys, we're gonna be... We're gonna be rushing these guys today.

[37:38.86]Hey, what do you want me to be?
[37:51.95]Ready to fire on the right.
[37:54.70]You got it.
[37:59.26]Let's double team this galleon.
[38:01.40]Get on each side.
[38:03.06]You say the word, Captain.
[38:04.08]I'm ready to fire.
[38:06.24]Ready to fire on the right.
[38:08.91]Take the shot till you get me.
[38:10.97]Well, I did it anyways.
[38:18.33]Get away, get away, get away
[38:49.38]I got the pump.
[38:52.87]That don't really seem like it's doing anything.
[38:54.49]Is that a guy on the mic?
[38:59.65]That sounded like a guy on the mic.
[39:04.11]Where are these holes?
[39:06.79]Where are the holes?
[39:10.27]Got the last one.
[39:12.22]Nice work.
[39:21.53]Nice job.
[39:25.67]Alright, where do you want me?
[39:26.69]Yeah.
[39:26.87]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
[39:52.23]I hope that was not friendly.
[39:56.73]Need powder.
[39:57.51]Blow it up.
[39:59.97]Need a shot.
[40:03.39]Cannonball.
[40:03.79]Got it.
[40:04.45]Check it.
[40:04.65]I'm ready.
[40:05.57]Ramming.
[40:05.87]I don't know.
[40:06.39]What does that mean?
[40:19.05]Okay, here we go.
[40:20.07]Light it.
[40:21.03]Shoot it.
[40:22.36]Push it.
[40:23.66]Light it.
[40:24.26]Fire.
[40:24.48]Take a look.
[40:25.42]Okay.
[40:25.68]I can see.
[40:26.16]Oh, fuck.
[40:27.12]I hope nobody didn't see that.
[40:47.68]You gotta drink the tea.
[40:49.30]I'm gonna sit down here and drink the tea.
[40:51.75]Where is it?
[40:52.07]Come on.
[40:53.03]Come on.
[40:53.61]Get away from the... That's seven down, my love.
[41:00.77]Oh, never mind.
[41:01.31]This one I know.
[41:03.33]This tea, this tea... Wow, come on.
[41:06.59]Wipe the blood off my screen.
[41:10.78]Okay, we're gonna equip the lighter.
[41:12.24]Is this one ready to go?
[41:13.56]No, not quite.
[41:14.36]Oh, they got more.
[41:17.02]What does he want to shoot?
[41:22.76]Did he say right side?
[41:28.63]Those are pirates, yeah.
[41:29.55]We'll just spin it around.
[41:32.41]Board that ship.
[41:35.19]Alright, so we're from Australia.
[41:38.51]And they're from Pirate Land.
[41:42.56]Is that a big pirate ship?
[41:43.50]Oh fuck, we gotta like help them out.
[41:44.74]It needs powder.
[41:49.98]Oh shit.
[41:50.66]No pump.
[41:51.08]Gotta pump it.
[41:52.26]I got this.
[41:54.08]I'm an expert pumper.
[41:59.98]I'm good.
[42:02.62]I put the lighter.
[42:03.60]This one's ready to go.
[42:05.64]This one's ready to go.
[42:06.48]Alright, these are all ready to go.
[42:12.44]There's a fire on the left.
[42:13.26]Oh, here we go.
[42:14.46]Take good shots here.
[42:20.22]Somebody's using this.
[42:21.76]Oh, what the hell?
[42:24.35]Get a shot in there.
[42:32.05]Ow!
[42:34.63]Ow!
[42:35.05]He was really cornering me.
[42:38.24]Get ready to fire on the right.
[42:40.36]I think this hit somebody.
[42:51.63]I don't think my mic is working.
[42:55.11]Whoa!
[42:55.75]This weapon, this weapon sucks.
[43:06.08]So we're still pumping, right?
[43:21.47]This thing is loaded.
[43:23.45]That's our team.
[43:24.51]Fire on the right, he says.
[43:31.91]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[43:41.04]It's not even loaded.
[43:41.60]I can return that gun.
[43:46.40]I want to, like, board this ship.
[43:53.00]Do I not have any more ammo for this fucking thing?
[43:57.75]I don't understand.
[44:02.37]I feel like there's too many people on this boat.
[44:06.20]I feel like there's like three or four too many people on the boat.
[44:15.52]There's a level three.
[44:19.14]It's like a job that I could be doing like somebody is like just running around in circles and like already doing it We need to like remove these we're gonna get like a new crew here Oh god Well, we just fucking drove into them See you later, buddy

[44:52.06]I'm like a little bunny rabbit jumping around.
[44:54.39]Wait, what?
[45:01.13]Can scrub the poop deck.
[45:03.57]How loud is this still, by the way?
[45:05.97]Should I like drop it even more?
[45:09.81]If you're alone in the water, you could be just jumping in the water in boredom.
[45:18.51]Oh, I just almost hit that guy in the fucking face.
[45:20.29]Oh, damn it.
[45:29.97]It's okay.
[45:31.25]It's a little loud.
[45:32.73]Yeah, not much I can do about it.
[45:33.91]Alright, there's two ships here.
[45:38.31]We need to move a little bit further.
[45:39.45]Keep going.
[45:45.41]Uh, is that a pirate ship?
[45:46.55]I don't even know.
[45:47.15]Is that a pirate boat?

[45:54.87]Can I snipe somebody?
[46:04.01]I don't even know what the trajectory of this fucking thing is.
[46:05.79]Got it.
[46:15.22]Come on!
[46:15.82]What?
[46:18.94]Did I not hit him?
[46:20.60]I didn't light that shit?
[46:22.16]That was bullshit.
[46:27.95]I feel like we're doing okay though.
[46:34.63]Oh my fuck.
[46:37.78]I fell off the goddamn boat.
[46:40.04]No I didn't.
[46:43.74]I'm good.
[46:48.50]This thing is out of like ammo?
[46:49.78]Am I lagging or what?
[46:52.55]Why is this?
[46:55.45]Alright, well I fucking just hit something.
[47:05.59]Light him up, light him up!
[47:07.86]Light these fucking people up!
[47:16.14]We win.
[47:17.71]Hey, we win.
[47:18.17]You know what that means.
[47:22.51]I'm bad at every game.
[47:23.71]No, I just start playing a new game every stream for the first time ever.
[47:31.92]I don't have time to get good at these games because I only play them for like two hours, three hours each.
[47:38.86]Anyways.
[47:39.16]You guys, here we go.
[47:45.08]I think it's time we did a little bit of a Mad Lib here.
[47:49.40]So, as you can see, we're currently in this section right here.
[47:53.48]We're doing this one.
[47:55.80]This is How to Date a Werewolf by Willow.
[47:58.64]Okay.
[47:59.96]So, we need an adjective.
[48:02.28]Adjective.
[48:05.29]Uh... Endearing.
[48:08.91]Endearing.
[48:12.23]Endearing.
[48:12.95]We need a verb ending in "-ing".
[48:17.48]Verbing, uh... Fucking.
[48:22.79]Whatever, right?
[48:23.37]Let's get like one sexual joke, huh?
[48:24.15]One sexual joke.
[48:24.95]Noun?
[48:25.07]Sex.
[48:25.15]Number?
[48:25.33]Oh, it's 69!
[48:25.51]I'm sorry.
[48:41.53]Noun.
[48:42.73]Streaming.
[48:43.57]No, we are no more like this is just like a streaming and sex one.
[48:47.21]Part of the body.
[48:51.08]Breadstick.
[48:54.14]I saw breadstick.
[48:56.20]So we're going to use that for part of the body.
[48:58.40]Verb ending in ing.
[49:03.95]Uh...
[49:08.17]P-PG.
[49:10.26]Okay, licking.
[49:19.94]This just got real fucking weird.
[49:23.23]Part of the body, plural.
[49:27.09]Part of the body, plural.
[49:28.49]So it's gotta be plural.
[49:33.45]Ears.
[49:35.64]Ears.
[49:37.00]Noun.
[49:44.92]Kidney?
[49:45.50]Kidney is a noun.
[49:49.24]I mean, kidney is a thing, right?
[49:50.71]Kidney.
[49:52.11]An adverb, right?
[49:53.49]Alright, we need an adverb.
[49:57.73]Alright, um... Stupidly.
[50:03.11]Stupidly.
[50:07.38]Stupidly.
[50:07.92]Another adjective, short.
[50:13.49]Noun.
[50:15.55]Spaghetti.
[50:18.59]I saw spaghetti.
[50:20.83]Part of the body.
[50:22.01]Nose.
[50:23.41]And we need one more adjective.
[50:28.32]Stupid!
[50:29.20]No, I'm not doing stupid twice.
[50:34.26]Energetic.
[50:34.82]Alright, here we go.
[50:39.85]So...
[50:46.20]My boyfriend, Oz, is a total fox.
[50:49.37]Well, actually, he's a werewolf.
[50:51.59]While this isn't an endearing quality to have in the person you're fucking, I'm learning how to deal.
[50:58.24]Like, when there's a false sex in the sky, make sure your were-sweetie is locked up in a cage for 69... 69 days straight.
[51:10.65]Cause they're gonna get super wolfy before and after.
[51:12.73]Trust me, shooting a tranquilizer streaming into the scary furry version of your hottie's breadstick because they're on a rampage does not make for a romantic date.
[51:21.81]Nobody wants to see their hunka hunka licking love eat a side of ears for dinner.
[51:28.02]Also remember that when they're in I'm a wolf and that's that mode, there's still a real kidney inside who you're stupidly in love with.
[51:35.44]I have to admit there's something short about Oz's primal nature.
[51:39.10]It kind of gives me spaghetti bumps.
[51:40.98]But not in a he's gonna rip my nose out of my chest way.
[51:44.12]More like an ooh, he's got an energetic side of way.
[51:47.30]Get the fuck out of here, Buffy!
[51:55.89]Fuck that!
[51:57.97]This was four dollars!
[52:02.75]Okay, let's continue.
[52:08.22]look how fucking stupid that stupid alright let's go I've got all these I got spaghetti that's just like a sex book well read it read like like what it's supposed it's about like dating a werewolf and like having sex with them oh shit I'm getting yelled at right now I'm on it
[52:35.38]I thought this was supposed to be a PG-13 stream.
[52:38.48]It is, but when you bring in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, sometimes it's not.
[52:41.92]So, I heard you had a crush on Buffy.
[52:44.91]Buffy?
[52:46.31]Who?
[52:46.71]What's her name?
[52:47.43]What's the actress's name?
[52:49.97]Why can't I do anything?
[52:53.41]Why can I not do anything?
[52:55.34]Okay, Otto, we're going to go back upstairs.
[52:56.88]I just wanted you to say hi.
[52:59.06]Oh, hello, dog.
[53:02.29]Alright, I'm getting yelled at.
[53:05.80]Everyone's a fan, Otto.
[53:08.30]My fucking audio is all fucked up, hold on.
[53:13.53]I think we just got hit.
[53:38.92]Can you guys hear me?
[53:41.20]Hold on.
[53:48.39]Alright, Gary.
[53:51.29]Yeah, yeah.
[53:53.28]Bring us to victory.
[53:55.50]I will if you motherfuckers will pass.
[54:05.74]It's a pirate.
[54:07.14]It's an un-fucking-sat marine.
[54:10.52]Gary.
[54:18.70]Why can- Hello?
[54:22.66]Can you guys hear me?
[54:26.02]What the fuck?
[54:28.49]Like, I'm trying to make it so they can hear me.
[54:29.99]No one's been able to hear me this whole fucking time.
[54:40.15]Like, I want them to be able to hear me.
[54:48.72]Alright.
[54:51.72]Well, whatever.
[54:52.22]I guess nobody can hear me.
[54:56.04]Okay, well, we're gonna leave this server.
[54:57.52]We're leaving that server.
[55:08.14]What is my name here?
[55:09.82]I don't even know.
[55:10.94]Is it Gary?
[55:21.34]Your mic's been muted the whole stream.
[55:22.94]Alright, let me just look at something real.
[55:29.07]I need to like see something here.
[55:30.89]Keyboard and mouse.
[55:33.44]Proximity VoIP is F. Global VoIP is G. Crew VoIP, Faction VoIP.
[55:38.28]This should be it, right?
[55:42.95]Maybe it's just not like picking up my mic.
[55:45.27]It could be so much more fun if people could actually hear what I was saying.
[55:51.27]VoIP volume, it is the way it is, right?
[55:55.97]Yeah, I'm pressing the right button.
[55:59.47]Gotta use V. I tried V before and V didn't do anything.
[56:01.87]Alright.
[56:02.99]I unlocked shit though, didn't I?
[56:06.17]What did I actually unlock?
[56:07.17]A whole lot of nothing, apparently.
[56:11.57]I don't know, was it hair?
[56:23.62]We're going with this.
[56:25.62]We'll stay with this.
[56:27.38]It's fine.
[56:29.79]Back.
[56:32.48]Is there anything besides TDM?
[56:35.04]Alright, there's these ones.
[56:37.94]TDM 1v1.
[56:38.88]Ooh.
[56:41.14]I want to do 1v1.
[56:45.11]I feel like that would be fun.
[56:45.89]Oh, 2v2.
[56:47.65]1v1.
[56:47.85]Uh, hide full.
[56:51.01]TDM 2v2.
[56:51.51]2v2.
[56:51.55]1v1.
[56:51.71]Here we go.
[56:53.95]There's a 1v1 right here.
[56:58.58]It's full already?
[56:59.58]What?
[57:00.12]Fuck.
[57:04.19]This is 2v2, right?
[57:06.73]2v2.
[57:10.81]Let's try this one.
[57:19.83]Let's go and join the pirate side.
[57:21.17]I guess we're going to join the big dig because that's like a thing in Boston.
[57:27.53]And let's go.
[57:29.49]I want to join this.
[57:31.39]Let me join it, man.
[57:32.41]Spawn it.
[57:33.73]Alright, let's go.
[57:35.11]We need people on the front level.
[57:39.47]Don't ask me why my title is the year 2000.
[57:44.63]Don't ask me why.
[57:46.15]Hey, can you guys hear me?
[57:46.81]What's up?
[57:47.05]It used to be a legendary ship known as the name White Tower.
[57:51.29]Can anybody hear me?
[57:51.95]Why can nobody fucking hear me?
[57:56.62]Dude, our teammates see you.
[58:00.47]This guy's not even holding anything.
[58:02.52]Or this girl, whatever.
[58:03.52]Let's try the fencing weapon.
[58:11.82]The stab weapon.
[58:17.35]Is it a sniper rifle or what?
[58:23.29]I don't give a fuck what these fucking clowns have to say.
[58:26.25]So we're gonna move on.
[58:28.25]We're just gonna play the game.
[58:38.21]I should probably check on the bits, huh?
[58:39.93]I've gotten a few.
[58:41.62]Holy, we're going fast!
[58:45.04]Jesus.
[58:45.50]Alright, well... I wish I was the captain.
[58:58.58]How do I be the captain?
[59:00.44]I need to do at least one of these when I'm the captain.
[59:03.32]Because I want to just steer us to victory.
[59:04.76]I want to fucking just... I will be so good.
[59:14.10]Captain was killed.
[59:14.82]How does he keep dying?
[59:15.62]There's nobody here.
[59:18.52]There's legit no one here.
[59:20.30]How is he dying?
[59:26.84]We're in the middle of nowhere.
[59:30.70]This 2v2 actually turned out to be kind of like a... A bust.
[59:39.15]I mean... I guess here we go.
[59:42.03]Are these people on our team?
[59:45.40]Who fucking knows?
[59:46.38]I don't even know at this point.
[59:48.78]No, they're on our team.
[59:50.12]Yeah, they're on our team.
[59:52.56]At this point, who the fuck cares?
[59:56.42]Oh, there we go.
[59:57.76]I kind of want to go back to one of those giant servers.
[60:00.39]That was fun.
[60:00.93]Let's try shooting with this.
[60:08.41]Shit.
[60:14.26]Oh, I hit the sail.
[60:19.94]Oh, come on.
[60:20.54]Let me just tap this guy in the back.
[60:24.76]I want to hit this guy that's lagging so bad.
[60:27.64]Shit.
[60:28.22]I'm like whizzing right by his head.
[60:30.60]I will get this.
[60:32.46]I will get it.
[60:32.98]I will get it.
[60:35.04]What?
[60:38.58]Come on.
[60:39.08]I very clearly shot that guy.
[60:50.25]Apparently not.
[60:50.97]How did I not hit that guy right in the head?
[60:59.31]Everything's so clear and I'm not under... I learned how to play the game.
[61:02.27]I mean, I was playing before.
[61:05.89]Like, right now I'm just kind of dicking around because... I'm more inclined to play the bigger game mode.
[61:12.86]I'm just fucking around right now.
[61:17.52]This game would be really fun with, like, four or five people that you know.
[61:22.67]But trying to jump in and having, like, a random captain be like, Alright, go to the right!
[61:26.75]Fire!
[61:27.19]Oh, fuck me.
[61:32.37]Climb the rope.
[61:34.27]Nooooo!
[61:38.72]Somebody just fucking come get me.
[61:42.16]Just somebody shoot me, please.
[61:49.39]You can't mutiny if your captain is dead.
[61:51.35]Yeah, you have to play this game with like five people to be on the same page.
[61:55.43]I'm going to get run over.
[61:58.67]Can I just sink already?
[62:09.58]Yeah, I'm pretty much like a shark.
[62:11.66]Get Etalyx.
[62:13.16]Etalyx had to... Could not be around tonight.
[62:18.28]Me and Etalyx are going to play something tonight.
[62:19.68]But he had a little bit of a... He had something he had to take care of.
[62:23.41]So he had to go do that.
[62:25.61]So he could not stream tonight.
[62:28.31]So I decided, alright.
[62:29.35]Well, I'm going to just find something else to play.
[62:30.97]And it was this game.
[62:37.48]And that's what we're doing.
[62:42.09]I just got smashed.
[62:43.03]Give me the tea.
[62:47.53]Tea, please.
[62:49.05]Oh wait, that was just alcohol.
[62:49.87]Let me drink that.
[62:52.07]Drink?
[62:52.55]No, please.
[63:00.81]Was that poison?
[63:01.49]I don't understand.
[63:06.75]Why did we just all die?
[63:11.39]We just all just fucking died for no reason.
[63:15.22]Like that guy.
[63:16.36]People are getting sick on this boat.
[63:19.66]Alright, these are all loaded.
[63:29.00]Wait, it is poison?
[63:31.14]It's not poison, right?
[63:32.22]Alright.
[63:45.20]Okay.
[63:49.30]This is the last one of the night that we're gonna do.
[63:51.16]The last Mad Lib.
[63:53.86]We're gonna skip to the very fucking end, by the way.
[63:58.67]We're going to the last page.
[64:06.87]Okay.
[64:07.99]The last page.
[64:10.09]Dawn's Diary, Love Spelled.
[64:12.31]And every single one of these, every single one,
[64:17.32]This is gonna be... Alright, we'll do... We'll do terrible.
[64:23.34]Adjective.
[64:23.84]Terrible.
[64:27.78]Uh... Plural noun.
[64:28.88]Bus stops.
[64:29.74]I saw somebody said bus stop.
[64:30.86]We'll do bus stops.
[64:33.20]Part of the body.
[64:33.86]Stupid.
[64:38.38]Uh... Color.
[64:39.31]Uh... Green.
[64:40.95]I love, you know, color green.
[64:42.71]Adjective.
[64:43.73]Um...
[64:46.31]I'm just gonna see the first one.
[64:47.19]I see... Uh... My other game's crashing.
[64:55.53]Crying?
[64:56.27]Uh, crying.
[64:56.67]That's not an adjective, really.
[65:00.22]Cactus?
[65:00.74]Alright, we're gonna use cactus for another noun.
[65:04.36]Cactus.
[65:05.98]Alright, like lanky.
[65:07.16]Alright, lanky.
[65:09.56]Verb ending in ing.
[65:11.80]Interesting.
[65:14.12]That's not a verb.
[65:15.38]It just... That was the first thing that ended in ing and I saw it.
[65:17.94]Okay.
[65:19.94]Verb ending in ing again.
[65:22.44]Ramming.
[65:24.00]Sure.
[65:26.86]Plural noun.
[65:29.08]Plural noun.
[65:29.50]We'll go with sheep.
[65:34.34]Sheep can be plural.
[65:36.50]First name.
[65:37.78]Jeremy.
[65:38.79]Of course, right?
[65:41.52]Adjective.
[65:42.48]Crying.
[65:43.78]No, that's not a fucking adjective.
[65:45.14]That's like a verb.
[65:49.53]Explosively.
[65:52.01]Alright.
[65:56.31]This is the last one.
[65:57.11]This is the last fucking one we're doing.
[66:01.38]I hate D. I've got some terrible news.
[66:04.68]I'm in love.
[66:05.84]There's this hottie with a body at school.
[66:07.61]His name is RJ.
[66:09.19]And I think we're meant to be.
[66:10.73]Like serious wedding bus stops chiming in our future.
[66:14.81]Not only is he a quarter stupid on the football team, he's also got the cutest smile and the best green hair.
[66:20.24]There's absolutely nothing lanky about him.
[66:22.66]I just wish I knew how to talk to him without making myself look like an interesting idiot.
[66:26.74]I even made a fool out of myself trying for the cheer-ramming team for him.
[66:31.21]But I'm making progress.
[66:32.67]He asked me out tonight.
[66:34.55]RJ's stupid teammate backstabbed him, so I pushed him down the sheet.
[66:42.90]That shit's done.
[66:43.80]Like, that shit's fucking done.
[66:47.22]Notice how the first and last are about, like, having a boyfriend or a girlfriend.
[66:54.94]Like, fuck that.
[66:57.10]Oh, the game's not even on.
[66:58.04]There we go.
[67:04.06]Uh, actually, I want to go to, like, one of the big servers.
[67:08.03]The big servers were way more fun.
[67:13.61]It landed perfectly on the chair?
[67:15.13]Oh, fuck, it did.
[67:17.85]Just weeding.
[67:22.84]It's not the last.
[67:24.06]No, that is the last.
[67:27.72]I skimmed through that.
[67:28.54]It was all about how the game is crashed.
[67:30.66]The game's dead, apparently.
[67:33.48]Okay.
[67:35.44]Well, we pretty much saw what we needed to see, right?
[67:38.97]So let's move on to something else.
[67:41.69]What else do I have here that I could play?
[67:45.67]Let's see.
[67:48.64]Uh, oh, hopefully the stream doesn't turn off.
[67:50.52]That would not be good.
[67:51.16]Let me, like, take this off.
[67:54.78]And just turn.
[67:55.34]I'm going to turn the webcam on.
[67:56.20]We're going to do a webcam stream for a minute.
[67:58.60]Hopefully the stream doesn't die.
[68:01.32]So, give me one second.
[68:04.40]Uh, if the stream crashes, oh, fuck, I'll be back.
[68:06.12]Don't worry.
[68:06.46]I'm sorry.
[68:06.88]Hold on.
[68:08.40]We're good.
[68:09.58]Alright.
[68:09.84]What can I play for the next, like, hour or so?
[68:12.64]Let me just see.
[68:17.01]I just see no sign of Etalyx.
[68:18.45]No.
[68:18.65]Alright, I'm going to hop out of there.
[68:22.76]If he was going to come around, he said he would be around.
[68:24.58]Maybe.
[68:25.48]Alright, let's... Family feud?
[68:31.54]You want me to go back to family feud?
[68:35.54]I can't go back to family feud right now.
[68:41.80]Let's see.
[68:44.84]Dark Souls?
[68:47.25]First of all, let me check the bits.
[68:48.91]Let me see what people said.
[68:51.45]Official Wang, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[68:53.53]They say you provided me with years of great entertainment.
[68:56.07]It's about time I gave something back.
[68:57.19]Well, thank you, Wang.
[68:58.41]Much appreciated.
[69:00.25]Purple, Never Trust Purple gave 1,500 bits.
[69:03.77]Says, I think I need to go to the doctor.
[69:05.09]I really hurt my snake last night.
[69:09.59]Out of context?
[69:10.59]Wait, without knowing like an hour ago?
[69:12.99]That's pretty fucking funny.
[69:15.62]It's pretty fucking funny.
[69:17.34]But thank you for the $1,500, dude.
[69:18.24]And he gave $500 before.
[69:20.72]I like how guys in the captain's quarters are just fucking drinking in the middle of a war.
[69:24.07]I know, right?
[69:26.41]Also, thanks to Little Almond for $15.
[69:28.33]Let me tell you a story about me old bones.
[69:31.33]That story never gets told.
[69:32.93]Thanks for the $15.
[69:33.86]Never Trust Purple again.
[69:34.86]$10 again.
[69:38.14]That was two days ago.
[69:39.42]Alright, well, thanks.
[69:41.10]Regardless, thank you.
[69:43.47]So... I broke my breadstick.
[69:50.22]So let me just load up.
[69:51.20]I'm just going to load up like... Why don't I just load up like GTA?
[69:55.80]And just run around and fucking murder people.
[69:57.60]And like just jump around and drive a car.
[70:04.32]The game me and Etalyx were going to play is... What the hell is it called?
[70:08.66]It was a game that he was talking about.
[70:11.29]He wanted to play it.
[70:12.15]And I was like, oh yeah, that sounds like maybe it could be fun.
[70:14.15]I don't know what the hell it was though.
[70:17.75]That will happen eventually.
[70:19.63]If not tomorrow night, maybe Etalyx will be around.
[70:25.51]Scare Saturdays.
[70:28.39]Movies.
[70:28.85]No, my movie stream has to be prepared.
[70:30.78]Has to be prepared.
[70:34.06]Peggle.
[70:34.86]GTA.
[70:36.04]I'll load it up.
[70:37.12]Let's load up GTA and just mess around.
[70:40.19]Why not, right?
[70:41.43]You know, there's another pirate game that we haven't played in a while.
[70:47.23]Wait a minute.
[70:50.59]Hold on just a second.
[70:51.49]Alright, we're sticking with the pirate games because I think Man O' War Corsair got an update.
[70:58.25]Let's do that.
[70:59.55]We're doing that instead.
[71:00.27]We're going to check out Man O' War Corsair again.
[71:07.82]Because it's been like six months, right?
[71:09.81]Let's see if they've added anything substantial.
[71:12.71]I'm down for that.
[71:16.03]Sea Dogs.
[71:16.67]No, not Sea Dogs.
[71:17.99]That game was fucking awful.
[71:21.39]This is a huge update.
[71:22.42]Holy shit.
[71:23.12]Okay.
[71:26.20]Well, alright.
[71:27.22]We're doing more pirate shit.
[71:30.38]Just needs to download.
[71:31.88]I don't know why it's not downloading.
[71:33.10]Okay.
[71:35.36]This is the one with the silly monsters.
[71:36.44]Yeah, I think they added a monster or two so we can find it.
[71:39.56]So that'd be fun.
[71:41.16]If it'll download, which hopefully it does.
[71:42.91]It doesn't look like it is.
[71:43.75]So we're just going to do like, we're going to sit here and do like a Q&A for fucking five minutes while this decides not to download.
[71:51.31]Jeremy, you're tall and handsome.
[71:52.45]Thank you very much.
[71:53.33]I appreciate that.
[71:57.68]Why is it not downloading?
[71:59.84]Come on, dude.
[72:03.63]This update is only, like, a couple of gigs.
[72:05.43]Come on, man.
[72:06.15]What is this shit?
[72:09.12]PSVR is in the corner.
[72:11.30]Yeah, that was from yesterday when I just, like, fucking ditched it.
[72:14.56]I threw it over there in, like, a rage.
[72:19.37]Alright, this is, like, kind of annoying.
[72:21.27]Come on, let's go.
[72:22.05]Why is it not downloading?
[72:25.33]It got to 10% in five seconds and then stopped.
[72:32.48]I'm going to give this like five more seconds.
[72:35.64]Play Frog Fractions in the meantime.
[72:39.30]I'm hoping this will just go.
[72:40.84]Like, I don't know what it's doing.
[72:41.72]Pause and do it again.
[72:42.98]This will take fucking 10 seconds to download.
[72:44.64]Come on, go.
[72:46.70]Download.
[72:48.90]Download.
[72:51.42]Yeah.
[72:53.16]Jeremy just got a... Oh, I got one question.
[72:54.86]Why?
[72:55.14]There we go.
[72:56.74]It's going now.
[72:57.64]Why what?
[73:00.19]Am I gonna stream some Switch?
[73:01.33]No, I didn't, like, I didn't, like, pre-order.
[73:03.09]I, like, fucking was so lazy, I didn't pre-order a Switch.
[73:06.09]I did not do it.
[73:07.61]I'm gonna be one of those guys that gets the Switch, like, a week later.
[73:10.51]But yes, I am gonna stream the Switch.
[73:12.42]Definitely.
[73:14.82]Do Mad Libs while we wait.
[73:17.38]I ripped the, yeah, how about this?
[73:22.83]I love how it tells you, like, just in case you don't know what these are.
[73:27.06]Hey, in case you forget what an adverb is, there it is.
[73:31.89]Do you know what a verb is?
[73:33.89]What does it mean once you do a place?
[73:38.64]Alright, so in the meantime, let's do this.
[73:41.16]Let's... What are you going to stream on the Switch?
[73:47.48]Well, I could do a couple of different things.
[73:51.74]I mean, Zelda is an obvious choice, but that doesn't come up like a month, right?
[73:55.34]That's like a month later, I think, right?
[73:59.97]There's some online Mad Libs you can do.
[74:02.05]No, the Mad Lib joke is... We're done with the Mad Lib joke.
[74:05.83]It was shitty to begin with, and it just got shittier as we went on.
[74:10.03]But, no.
[74:12.23]Zelda, I would try.
[74:13.03]There's a couple of...
[74:16.67]That, like, punch game where you have to, like, fight your friends.
[74:18.85]The Fast Draw Showdown sequel.
[74:21.79]That's coming out.
[74:23.53]That should be really fun.
[74:24.73]Hopefully.
[74:26.63]Zelda is a launch title.
[74:27.69]Okay, well, I didn't... I wasn't aware of that.
[74:29.49]I thought it was coming out later.
[74:30.27]Alright, well, because this is taking a fucking million years for some reason, my internet sucks right now.
[74:36.14]I don't know why.
[74:36.76]Let's just do this.
[74:41.08]Let's load up... Uh...
[74:56.19]What the fuck can't I just play right now for like five minutes?
[74:59.84]I'm going to start playing and this is going to be ready to go.
[75:04.62]Play GTA.
[75:05.56]The second I load that shit up, I'm just going to chill for like five minutes or so.
[75:12.59]Fast Draw 2 Revenge of the Mad Libs.
[75:16.72]Launch titles.
[75:17.46]I don't think Breath of the Wild will be bad.
[75:19.58]I think it'll be a good game.
[75:24.05]Earth Defense Force.
[75:25.78]I actually do have that still.
