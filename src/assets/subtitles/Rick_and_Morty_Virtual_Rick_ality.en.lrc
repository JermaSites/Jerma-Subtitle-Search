[00:00.94]Okay, so the next one I'm going to move to, and I'm only going to, I'm like drained already.
[00:08.65]The next one I'm moving to is probably going to just about 5,000 people here.
[00:13.55]Probably 1,600 of you are going to leave.
[00:24.56]I'll show you why.
[00:26.48]I saw it on Steam.
[00:27.16]I had to buy it.
[00:28.18]Even though it's probably going to be terrible.
[00:30.66]I don't know.
[00:31.08]It might be good.
[00:43.81]No, it's not Picross VR.
[00:47.47]Take a snapshot, okay?
[00:48.53]I'm serious.

[02:39.14]Alright.
[02:41.87]I'm ready.
[02:44.29]Ow.
[02:52.55]We're a Rick and Morty.
[02:55.13]Look at that tension.
[02:57.32]How do I do anything?
[02:58.04]What do I do?
[03:04.88]This is really awful.
[03:08.09]You couldn't have made this quote out of fucking jello or something.
[03:12.69]The disk.
[03:15.05]Do Rick's laundry.
[03:30.97]That's unplayable.
[03:36.91]And no, I don't mean the game, I mean the headset.
[03:42.26]You wanna see a fucking magic trick?
[03:49.20]Oh shit!
[03:54.16]I probably just made everybody throw up, I'm so sorry.
[04:02.54]I have to sit here and let this unwind.
[04:10.23]Oh my god, it's so tight back here.
[04:14.45]How does it even get like this?
[04:23.19]Alright, let it spin.
[04:25.96]Come on, let's go.
[04:36.42]Get... ...in!
[04:39.02]There.
[04:40.01]There we go.
[04:42.73]Now I can spin it.
[04:44.63]I physically couldn't even turn it.
[04:45.65]It was bunched up.
[04:52.97]Finally.
[04:53.56]My god.
[04:56.48]Gonna have to take, like, a powder break.
[05:00.98]Someone has to come in here and powder my face, untangle my cord.
[05:11.73]That's fun.
[05:15.19]It is though.
[05:22.12]This is way too fucking loud.
[05:23.48]Alright, here we go.
[05:25.18]Alright, let's come back.
[05:34.80]I'm sorry if I made you almost throw up there, because I almost did too.
[05:51.32]Okay, do Rick's laundry.
[06:09.57]Hey look, we're ready to play a video game.
[06:11.29]Let's go.
[06:11.75]Rick and Morty.
[06:14.95]Okay.
[06:15.55]Can't wait to hear more like made-up words.
[06:38.55]Why am I playing this?
[06:39.71]Because this is my out.
[06:40.93]Because this is my way out.
[07:05.53]Minecraft VR, I'm out of gas, and this is my way out.
[07:12.06]You'll be begging me to turn the stream off in about 20 minutes.
[07:20.63]Holy crap, Rick.
[07:22.91]You made a Morty clone, Rick.
[07:24.61]Yeah, I know.
[07:25.54]It's me, Morty.
[07:29.39]This looks like when The Simpsons went into 3D and it looked weird.
[07:32.15]Okay.
[07:32.25]How do I even move?
[08:05.78]You can drink.
[08:06.45]You want some?
[08:09.77]Right in your fucking eyes.
[08:12.67]Oh, look at this.
[08:17.83]It's our dirty underwear.
[08:20.54]Oh, what the fuck?
[08:23.10]How do I move?
[08:25.51]I don't know how to move.
[08:26.37]Morty.
[08:26.87]How do I move?
[08:45.89]Geez, I mean, boy, this Morty clone really doesn't know what the hell it's doing, you know?
[08:51.73]It's just kind of bumbling, bumbling about.
[08:54.75]Yeah, I know, I know.
[08:55.83]I see the same thing you see, Morty.
[08:59.29]Dude, the physics engine fucking fell back.
[09:03.71]No, I'll take something.
[09:06.39]Oh, okay, I thought it wanted me to put it in the... Morty, listen to me.
[09:10.45]Listen to me, Morty.
[09:11.11]Morty, listen to me.
[09:13.49]I got it.
[09:26.19]I need that.
[09:37.42]Your shot is Sideshow Bob from The Simpsons.
[09:39.44]I figured it out.
[09:41.18]LAWSUIT!
[09:45.14]Ah, okay, good.
[09:46.10]So now that this Morty clone finished the laundry, I don't need it anymore.
[09:49.38]I mean, it's pretty much just a useless pile of floating head and hands, so I think I'll just go ahead and shoot.
[10:00.01]Hi, looks like you're dead. Welcome to purgatory. The devil's not available so you get me, the devils secretary.
[10:06.01]We weren't actually expecting you to be dead so soon, so if you don't want to be dead you can just press that button right in front of you on the phone.
[10:18.01]Do it again?
[10:18.33]Hey uh, over here Morty clone. Listen uh had to bring you back for some really important stuff that I can't get into right now because me and Morty have to go.
[10:26.96]Some stuff's gotten out of hand.
[10:28.00]Yeah you know, we've got to hurry Rick, come on.
[10:30.00]Alright listen I made a teleport system for you all you have to - thank you - you know, look in the direction you want to go in the room and then click the trackpad button under your thumb.
[10:39.00]Just- just push the button down and you can teleport to any part. Alright, now one last thing Morty clone, there's a watch over there on the shelves.
[10:46.00]I'm gonna need you to grab the watch and put it on your wrist. You'll be able to call me using the watch. This is very important, alright Morty clone?
[10:57.62]What do we... What's this one called?
[11:03.83]Rick, ah, wait!
[11:05.39]Ah, I think I can figure it out.
[11:07.21]That's the Schmeichelbox.
[11:09.35]That's the Floggenflaggenblagger, right?
[11:13.81]This is the Grubbenglobbenglobbenglobber, right?
[11:17.25]Something like that?
[11:19.53]Oh, and this is just a crown, Morty.
[11:33.84]Okay.
[11:34.41]Hey!
[11:34.61]Hey, I'm Mr. Meeseeks.
[12:04.29]Look at me No, no, I didn't know what Look at me
[12:36.89]Everybody did that, come on.
[12:41.52]That was fucking actually kind of brutal.
[12:44.36]Give me another one!
[12:47.28]Give me another one, give me another one, give me another one.
[12:50.55]How many can I have?
[12:51.47]Let's say I have like five.
[13:14.20]Okay.
[13:15.82]So, what do you want to do?
[13:24.21]What the fuck just happened?
[13:25.73]Alright, so, what do you want to do?
[13:27.05]Call me?
[13:28.43]I mean, could you imagine if you combined the usefulness of the U-seeks with, you know, that driveway and maybe that part that's sitting out there?
[13:35.47]Get out of the phone.
[13:49.76]Got it.
[13:58.70]Throw it to me.
[14:06.67]What just happened?
[14:09.59]Not great.
[14:11.69]Probably a good idea not to order these off of Flork's list.
[14:14.11]I'm going to need you to order me another one of these things, Clone Morty.
[14:17.65]Head over to my workbench and I'll activate my computer remotely using my... Not like this.
[14:23.55]Not like this.
[14:34.76]Okay, order me another one.
[14:45.46]I wasn't paying attention, I'm sorry.
[14:48.63]Oh, how did you die?
[14:51.69]Alright, what does it want me to do?
[15:01.31]Uh...
[15:17.46]What the fuck?
[15:26.61]That just makes you small?
[15:27.87]Okay.
[15:33.75]Alright, give me something, right?
[15:34.89]Give me order something.
[15:35.65]What does it want me to do?
[15:44.62]Turn up the game audio.
[15:55.52]Please don't.
[15:56.81]What did I have to do?
[15:57.53]He wanted me to... I don't remember what he wanted me to do.
[16:06.83]Nitro dark matter.
[16:08.19]No, you actually... Alright, hold on.
[16:28.65]plane.
[16:29.19]It's fraught with anxiety and misery and existential dread.
[16:34.35]I mean... Okay, what was the actual goal?
[16:39.86]He said, order me, order me.
[16:43.20]What was it?
[16:43.96]He used the phone.
[16:51.79]I'm going to need to head over to my workbench where my computer is and order me...
[17:05.83]Oh.
[17:23.94]What?
[17:25.80]Oh, it broke.
[17:29.10]Rick, your computer's broken.
[17:30.28]Hey, good morning, yeah.
[17:31.64]Um, just go to my work, but...
[17:38.43]I'm gonna need you to fix it.
[17:39.89]The instructions are in the cabinet door.
[17:45.51]RAM, CPU, GPU.
[17:47.66]Got it.
[17:49.48]Okay, RAM goes in there.
[17:50.70]Uh, what is this?
[17:55.08]Crystal.
[17:56.86]It's broken.
[17:58.42]And then, uh, fuse.
[17:59.28]Okay.
[18:01.58]Uh, use that to get fuse, uh, don't forget he has RAM.
[18:07.13]Okay.
[18:07.98]So don't forget he has RAM down there and down here.
[18:13.00]Hey, be careful, Clone Morty.
[18:14.30]There's a monster down there.
[18:15.66]He's not really dangerous.
[18:16.68]He's just an asshole.
[18:17.72]He likes carrots.
[18:28.30]You just spit that back into my mouth.
[18:31.80]I need to make a carrot hammer.
[18:37.18]carrot hammer uh I can go I could use that portal machine what was the bonus portal machine for used to get fused uh

[19:59.62]Alright, charge the battery.
[20:08.61]Charging station or something in here?
[20:11.93]It charges...
[20:29.91]Can't pass the IQ gear check.
[20:34.05]I'm actually just exhausted for some reason.
[20:36.23]I don't know why.
[20:48.72]Charge it.
[20:53.96]That's pretty close to Jerma's son.
[21:52.85]I did it!
[21:54.86]This is stressing me out.
[22:00.88]Goodbye!
[22:01.30]I got a battery for you.

[22:44.42]And I need to make a... A fucking carrot... A carrot thing.
[22:50.65]Or a weird apple.
[22:52.67]Metal apples.
[22:53.95]How the hell am I a metal apple?
[22:59.82]He's a metal?
[23:07.04]Well, there's a crystal.
[23:07.90]Wow, whoa, look at you, Cone Morty.
[23:11.62]Round of applause.
[23:12.44]You put a crystal in a slot.
[23:14.96]Not the first time.

[23:47.65]Screwdriver.
[24:00.37]Hammer.
[24:02.83]Hammer.
[24:05.71]Look up.
[24:08.35]You know what they say, hammers don't hurt people, people hurt people.
[24:12.01]Alright, I beat Rick and Morty's Rickality.
[24:24.38]Put it up.
[24:29.88]Looks good.
[24:32.78]Now what are we gonna do this Rick I
[24:52.18]Yep.
[24:52.34]Ehhhhh.
[25:21.57]Okay.
[25:21.69]Do I get to choose?
[25:22.25]Oh.
[25:53.05]I thought I was gonna get a drop down.
[25:54.11]Into the tournament?
[26:00.96]Clone Morty, step one of this very challenging part of the game, attach the device to the bottom of the plunger.
[26:07.70]Oh!
[26:40.00]I'm just a baby right now, I'm not even talking.
[26:44.26]I'm just a baby playing with fucking toys.
[26:53.23]Alright, got it.
[26:56.29]Go on to the toilet.
[27:14.68]Now what?
[27:15.28]Oh, come on.
[27:15.86]What?
[27:58.33]I need something to fix the toilet.
[28:00.09]Here we go.
[28:00.47]This is the toilet fixer thing.
[28:09.70]Rick, I don't know.
[28:34.63]What the fuck is this?
[28:37.04]Good job, Clone Morty.
[28:38.48]I told Morty, you know, to use the bathtub to deposit that thing, but he insisted on the toilet.
[28:42.98]Now we have to grab it.
[28:44.62]Now that we have it, grab it and head back through the portal.
[28:47.82]This.
[28:49.90]Okay, it's an almond.
[28:58.37]Oh, they're back!
[28:59.49]Clone Morty, you're finally back from your little bathroom adventure.
[29:02.70]Sure thing Rick they didn't get it
[29:33.67]Megaseed artificial intelligence microprocessor activated.
[29:37.48]Alright, good.
[29:38.20]We're gonna need some help upgrading this car.
[29:40.60]Since you can't talk, go ahead and call me on your watch thing.
[29:43.56]You know, the thing on your wrist.
[29:45.20]Why can't you just tell me right now?
[29:49.02]Oh, oh, okay, you're ready to go, huh?
[29:51.29]Alright, I'm gonna need your help to upgrade the rest of the car.
[29:53.69]Hey, Rick, how's the clone supposed to know how to fix the car, you know?
[29:56.95]I mean, it's just a dumb clone.
[29:58.45]Morty, the instructions are simple.
[30:00.13]Yeah, right, Rick.
[30:01.27]I mean, you couldn't figure it out?
[30:03.56]Shut up, Morty.
[30:07.76]So, we... We, looking at the car engine, should give you a bunch of clues.
[30:15.56]There's nothing in there.
[30:16.50]Can I wear this?
[30:17.30]I don't want it on!
[30:45.37]Do I have to charge this thing in the- Oh god.
[30:56.12]Really?
[30:56.56]I- This is gonna- I have to- I have to end this stream after this one.
[31:15.07]I'm running out of fumes.
[31:16.95]I don't know why I'm so tired.
[31:18.09]Look at how long this takes though.
[31:54.76]The fate of the universe is in my fucking hands.
[31:59.24]One fuck up and this whole thing, the whole planet goes down.
[32:10.47]Let's go.
[32:19.51]Where is it?
[32:29.00]What happened?
[32:29.76]I didn't draw.
[32:32.66]Help, I have my hand, but help, the... Come on.
[32:56.99]I actually have to get out of the headset.
[33:04.78]After I plug it in the fucking car, I think it's time for me to go.
[33:07.85]If you're a fan of the show, this is probably really cool.
[33:24.89]And yeah, I know this is the other VR game I played today, but don't worry, we're gonna come back.
[33:46.87]I can't fucking hear anything.
[33:50.59]It's got... I can always tell when it's time for me to stop.
[33:53.49]When... I'm sweating so much inside of my ears.
[34:00.03]That this thing won't stay in.
[34:01.39]It's oiled inside of here.
[34:05.42]It's oily.
[34:06.94]And it just keeps falling off.
[34:07.78]That's how I know it's time.
[34:20.81]Now what?
[34:21.37]Let's get the repair kit.
[34:22.81]Colonel Morty.
[34:52.61]How does this thing work?
[34:53.94]Let's go check it out over here.
[34:55.10]Oh, fuck.
[35:03.92]What?
[35:12.51]Incorrect combination.
[35:14.29]Please try a little harder.
[35:16.09]I need to match?
[35:17.90]So like green to green?
[35:18.84]Green to green?
[35:23.64]It's only one match.
[35:25.62]Watch out.
[35:37.91]No more than five bands total.
[35:40.51]No more than one blue and at least two reds.
[35:53.48]Nope.
[36:04.89]What do you call that fuckery?
[36:13.38]So there's one red, and here's two.
[36:15.66]I can't... At least one link with no duplicate colors, so that's this one.
[36:24.03]No more than five bands total.
[36:26.19]One, two, three, four, five.
[36:32.57]And it's got, okay, this code's on here too.
[36:34.59]Hold on.
[36:38.90]One link serial ending in a number and one ending in a letter.
[36:43.34]Oh my God.
[36:57.27]I need to see what the number... Alright, so one has to end in a number, one has to end in a letter.
[37:18.44]You got yellow, yellow, six.
[37:21.83]Five for... I'm done.
[37:47.13]Oh my God, I'm so tired.
[37:54.62]Did you enjoy your stay?
[37:56.24]Minecraft VR was really cool.
[37:58.32]That was cool too.
[37:59.24]I'm just completely out of fucking steam.
[38:02.58]I just got nothing in the tank.
[38:12.77]Yeah, this usually is when it happens.
[38:14.49]Around like four and a half hours.
[38:16.17]Just about like four to five hours.
[38:23.13]Oh, yeah.
[38:24.83]How bad do I look today?
[38:39.02]Oh, alright.
[38:39.82]So coal mine.
[38:44.56]No, no, no coal right now.
[38:51.29]I look like fucking somebody diarrhea-ed all over me.
[38:56.63]But!
[38:58.33]That's gonna be it.
[39:00.41]I will see you guys... I'll see you guys in a few days.
[39:05.38]Cause I gotta take the next few days off.
[39:08.14]I've got some things to take care of.
[39:10.28]I've got some friends that came up.
[39:12.38]So I'm gonna see them for a little while.
[39:17.44]I'll see you guys real soon.
[39:19.57]We'll do the bits.
[39:28.35]I was taking the piss on the Minecraft thing, but it was actually really, really cool.
[39:34.35]And it doesn't cost anything either.
[39:35.83]That mod is free.
[39:44.46]I typically like to go a little bit longer, but... No, I got nothing.
[39:50.76]I'm not going to pretend I do, you know?
[39:55.81]Anyways, let's go through the bits.
[39:58.75]Thank you for joining me, everybody.
[40:02.89]When I get back... We got... I'll be back on... Probably Wednesday is when the next stream will be.
[40:14.38]So Wednesday afternoon I'll be back.
[40:17.14]Joel and I are gonna do our...
[40:20.17]gamer competition in PogoStuck, PogoStick, whatever it's called.
[40:24.23]PogoStuckRage, PogoStickRage.
[40:29.52]Joel, as in VargSkeletor.
[40:31.86]I don't know if that's going to happen on Wednesday, but we'll be talking back and forth about it, so... We'll see.
[40:41.04]That's going to happen probably next week, if we can get our schedules correct.
[40:45.30]Five community subs, thank you so much.
[40:47.94]That just came in right now.
[40:50.94]Those came in from Bingo Sunshine.
[40:52.38]Thank you so much.
[40:53.70]That's a shitload of community subs.
[40:55.52]People give a lot of community subs on this channel.
[41:01.70]Every stream is at least, like, 50.
[41:03.53]It's insane.
[41:08.87]But yeah, then there's more.
[41:09.69]I want to do Mine Show, but that's going to be a whole stream.
[41:12.23]I really did not expect Minecraft VR to take up three and a half hours of this stream.
[41:17.10]But it did, somehow.
[41:21.43]But there are plenty of things lined up.
[41:25.27]If you're taking off, I'll see you soon.
[41:28.94]See you on Wednesday.
[41:31.36]Much love to you.
[41:33.26]And let's go back to the Cremator.
[41:36.60]Cremator, a few hours ago, gave $5.
[41:40.82]Jerma, I see your place in MemeCraft.
[41:45.49]Good job.
[41:45.99]Oh, and I played...
[41:49.11]Oh.
[41:50.69]Is this the fire dude again?
[41:51.79]Alright, well, good lo- I don't- don't- I- I've already said bye, peace.
[42:02.01]Thank you for the five dollars, though.
[42:10.82]Uh, thank you, Alf the Librarian, for the five dollars.
[42:13.10]My, uh, library filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
[42:17.44]That's not good.
[42:22.97]Your library data.
[42:26.95]Sorry to hear that.
[42:29.07]We're liquidating our library because Chat stormed in and bought all the good books.
[42:35.06]Well, at least Chat has some reading material now.
[42:40.96]Hey, Dorkcube!
[42:42.46]Thanks for the $2.50.
[42:45.40]Can't watch the stream right now, but I just want to say thank you for being a man of your word.
[42:49.28]Even if Chat kind of sort of cheated at Picross.
[42:53.95]I told you guys I was gonna do it.
[42:58.19]I'm a man of my word sometimes.
[43:03.71]I like to be a man of my word all the time.
[43:05.59]I try.
[43:11.71]Hey, Snoozencopter, thanks for the 250, Snoozencopter.
[43:14.55]Every time Jerma plays Minecraft, he gets the rarest spawns.
[43:18.01]I think I don't keep up with Minecraft.
[43:20.51]Is the ocean thing rare?
[43:22.97]Whatever, Minecraft actually is kind of fun.
[43:25.60]I should play it again.
[43:26.78]Never mind.
[43:27.66]What I wanted to ask, I have trouble gaining weight.
[43:31.04]I'm 21, Jerma.
[43:32.02]I know you struggled with that too in the past.
[43:33.92]Or maybe you still do.
[43:34.80]Any advice?
[43:36.68]uh you even got the calorie drinks careful with the calorie drinks those they got a lot of like maltodextrin in them which is just heavy sugar they're full of almost cake batter but uh when I was working out when I actually you know cared about lifting and trying to be physically fit and all that years ago just you just gotta eat especially if you have like a lightning metabolism like I do
[44:06.92]You have to eat high-calorie foods, but good.
[44:11.63]You don't want to just dump empty calories in your body.
[44:14.23]You'll get fat.
[44:15.85]You'll gain weight that you don't want if you eat, you know, 50, 60, 80 grams of saturated fat.
[44:27.18]You could eat a whole pizza every day, and you'd gain weight, but it would be bad.
[44:33.14]It would be all over the place.
[44:39.79]But yeah, I ate a lot of tuna fish.
[44:42.95]You have to really like it, though.
[44:45.13]And I don't really... I'm not sure if the medical science there would tell you to eat a bunch of tuna anymore.
[44:59.52]But I wish you luck.
[45:00.76]It's a journey.
[45:10.44]What are you doing?
[45:19.72]Skrillex tweeted you.
[45:22.48]What?
[45:33.23]Hold on, is this Skrillex?
[45:36.15]The giant rat that makes all the rules.
[45:40.61]Is this a real account?
[45:48.95]Why did you... Why did... Is this... Or is it weird that I automatically assume his account got hacked?
[46:01.79]Like that... Is that... Is this for real?
[46:05.37]Wow, that's... Kind of... That's kind of crazy.
[46:08.79]I didn't... That's...
[46:16.23]He's a fan.
[46:18.47]Well, if you're watching this, Skrillex, that's... Hi.
[46:25.19]That's... I did not think I was gonna get up in the morning and see that Skrillex has a tweet of the Rats song.
[46:35.00]But, yeah.
[46:35.84]Cool.
[46:38.82]Very cool.
[46:45.47]But, anywho...
[46:48.33]respond to the tweet yeah maybe later I'll like do something I'll reply or something that's wild anyway let's get let's keep going with the bits
[47:10.49]Uh, DoorCube says, I can't watch- Thank you for the $2.50, DoorCube.
[47:14.29]Can't watch the stream right now, but I just want to say thank you for being a man of your word.
[47:17.30]Oh, I just read this.
[47:18.04]That's how slow I am right now.
[47:19.42]I am on... I am like... Pull it up to the fucking gas station.
[47:34.09]But that was Snoozing Copter and DoorCube.
[47:40.54]Uh, thank you Code Man for the 250.
[47:41.66]Thanks Code Man.
[47:44.56]Be honest Jeremy, you shower in your swim trunks, don't you?
[47:49.66]No, I don't.
[47:50.62]I shower naked like every normal human being.
[47:57.86]Thank you Zero Jiplets for the bits.
[48:01.70]Thank you for screaming like the judge from Roger Rabbit being dipped when you fell in the lava.
[48:11.35]Who showers naked?
[48:12.85]I'm gonna take a bath today.
[48:14.09]That's what I'm doing.
[48:24.91]Somebody said, look at the comments on that thread.
[48:29.55]What is that fucking image?
[48:33.41]What is that like third image down?
[48:46.37]It's just... Which one?
[48:49.53]The one of my face with my teeth stretched out and my face squished in.
[48:56.81]Show, show.
[48:57.35]I mean, here's the tweet.
[48:58.17]Just go, just look down.
[49:07.96]But, thank you.
[49:08.84]Thank you, SomeGuy, for the five bucks.
[49:11.48]And it's a...
[49:14.63]a youtube link I'm back for the first time in forever with another meme video I'm still too lazy to edit together an actual good phantom meme so here's another placeholder I actually have to change so I can see this it's going through the vibe still I'm gonna make it so it's coming through the actual desktop and not the headphones on the vibe
[49:46.99]You guys are fucking too much.
[49:49.54]How's that?
[49:52.56]Can I hear?
[49:52.92]I can hear now.
[49:54.02]Yes, I can.
[49:55.08]Can you hear, though?
[49:55.80]That's important.
[50:02.52]Speakers.
[50:03.70]There they are.
[50:06.32]Testing.
[50:07.18]There we go.
[50:08.22]Alright, so this is a meme video.
[50:12.64]I wonder what kind of meme it is.
[50:17.25]This is... Gog... Gognam Style T-Rex.
[50:21.17]Is that... I don't...
[50:47.56]Somebody came in and said, did he play nothing but Minecraft?
[50:50.96]The unfortunate answer is yes.
[50:58.53]And then I played Rick and Morty.
[50:59.47]I thought Rick and Morty... Oh, how many people left during that?
[51:03.71]I wanted to have five minutes later.
[51:10.81]Like 200.
[51:11.03]About 200.
[51:22.05]I can't believe, like, there's four or five thousand fucking people.
[51:26.61]That's... You guys are two kinds, seriously.
[51:33.45]But thank you for the meme video, some guy.
[51:37.90]Thank you.
[51:40.10]Uh, we have, uh, Jane Doe Walken, $15 from Jane Doe Walken.
[51:45.86]They say, making evil meals.
[51:49.16]Making evil meals.
[51:51.89]I'm not sure that's a reference to.
[51:56.12]But thank you, Jane Doe Walken.
[52:00.68]End the stream so I can watch the VOD faster.
[52:09.09]Not much longer.
[52:09.61]We only got a few more.
[52:10.91]And by a few more, I mean like 10.
[52:12.89]Maybe.
[52:14.81]Here we go.
[52:15.25]JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[52:17.25]Gave $10.
[52:17.47]And they say...
[52:23.35]First of all, thank you for the $10.
[52:26.47]I ain't changing it.
[52:27.31]You lied somehow.
[52:29.29]I just don't know how yet.
[52:31.81]Upon further investigation, you did not reenact JermaCraft The Adventure Begins Episode 1.
[52:37.18]You paraphrased it at best.
[52:40.50]I called the police to ask, and they said you lied.
[52:47.52]How am I supposed to memorize...
[52:51.23]The entire first three minutes of that video.
[52:55.95]I've seen it.
[52:56.53]I... I know it kind of.
[53:05.31]Half of chat has it memorized.
[53:07.15]You lived it.
[53:08.06]Yeah, I lived it.
[53:19.68]Didn't see lots of fails.
[53:20.78]Well, I didn't say lots of fails lots of triumphs.
[53:24.74]That's not good But thank you Jerma light about Minecraft that for the 10 bucks and for the Community subs as well.
[53:34.13]Thank you Thank you Al the chemist Al the chemist for the three bucks I
[53:44.95]Hey man, I'm pretty fucking drunk right now, but I just want to let you know that I think you're an incredibly funny and interesting person, and you bring me such joy when you stream.
[53:53.21]Thank God you stream later now, I can actually watch your stuff.
[53:56.70]LOL.
[53:57.94]I'll send more bits later because I bought the 500 pack, but next time the message will be less coherent.
[54:02.82]Because I'm still drinking.
[54:04.52]We'll see.
[54:06.28]We'll see.
[54:07.18]That's Al the Chemist.
[54:08.53]That was about two hours ago.
[54:14.73]Thank you so much.
[54:16.95]I'm honored that you think that I'm interesting.
[54:21.75]Thank you, as always.
[54:22.59]Thank you so much.
[54:26.15]He's drunk so he doesn't mean it.
[54:27.45]No, he's drunk so he does mean it.
[54:31.66]That's the reverse of what you're talking about.
[54:35.86]Freudian Weapon gave $10.
[54:38.14]They said, this stream makes me really want to pick Minecraft back up again.
[54:42.59]Good way to de-stress.
[54:44.35]Yeah, we caught that one earlier, but it's true.
[54:48.03]You can't really just hang out and hit some trees.
[54:53.61]I had a... This was a great... This is a good stream.
[54:56.14]I liked just kind of experiencing that again, even though... I wish I could have done it a little longer.
[55:02.42]Maybe go and explore some more.
[55:05.06]But...
[55:06.78]It was scary in VR.
[55:07.84]It was good.
[55:09.84]It was a lot of fun.
[55:11.98]Highly recommend it.
[55:15.00]And if you have a Vive, it's free.
[55:16.97]The VR portion, at least.
[55:21.43]Oh, Al the Chemist, an hour later than his first message.
[55:27.54]Thank you for the... I mean, this is under the bit minimum here, but I'm curious.
[55:32.34]I need to know.
[55:33.82]This is the second cheer from my drunk me-my dude.
[55:37.42]I hope you had fun.
[55:38.34]Minecraft is def a game that has its merits.
[55:41.05]Hope you give modded Minecraft a try sometime.
[55:44.21]That'd be cool.
[55:44.71]Have a good night.
[55:47.85]That's... No, that's... That's very coherent, actually.
[55:54.22]Oh, onto the bit reading about... Unbelievable.
[55:57.40]No.
[56:00.61]It's not like one of, uh... It's not like... I don't like Minecraft.
[56:08.89]I give it shit, but you know I'm just kidding around.
[56:10.73]Oh, it's a kid's game!
[56:14.44]No, it's an any... Anybody can enjoy that experience.
[56:18.58]I'm just fucking around.
[56:19.38]I hope you know that, guys.
[56:25.07]And now he's backtracking.
[56:26.11]I'm the master of backtracking.
[56:27.71]I say something, and then I think, eh, probably shouldn't have said it.
[56:31.21]Four hours later, I go, hey, by the way.
[56:44.88]But thank you, Althechemist.
[56:45.80]Thank you, Smellyboy, for the $2.50.
[56:46.92]This is actually horrible.
[56:48.15]Please go back to Minecraft.
[56:52.17]Was it Rick and Morty?
[56:54.81]Was it the Rick and Morty game?
[57:00.27]I probably should have just stayed in Minecraft for another 30 to 40 minutes and do the whole four, four and a half hours in Minecraft.
[57:17.12]Nah, I blame part of that on me.
[57:19.56]Because I wasn't really talking, I wasn't really saying much.
[57:24.63]It was just blasted.
[57:29.59]When I get tired, when I, you know, start to slow down, I shut off.
[57:35.65]And just... What's that?
[57:40.43]Oh.
[57:43.44]Okay.
[57:45.68]Yeah.
[57:47.90]And that's why I decided it's like, it's probably time to stop.
[57:55.84]Uh, Demonic Cucumber, thank you.
[57:59.50]They say... I witnessed one of the rarest events in the game.
[58:04.92]Lightning will randomly spawn maybe a Skeleton Trap Horse with a chance of 0.75 to 1.5% chance on easy.
[58:12.29]It's a, uh... Wow.
[58:27.27]And I got four at once.
[58:30.16]And there's a 1.5 to 4% chance on normal and a 6.7% chance or 2.8% chance on hard.
[58:36.82]On top of that, skeleton horses have the rarest spawn rates, making the chances of you seeing that less than 1%.
[58:43.40]In fact, I'd wager that you are the first person to ever experience that on a VR livestream.
[58:49.45]You've literally become a part of Minecraft history.
[58:58.67]Alright.
[58:59.09]Hey.
[59:00.11]It was crazy.
[59:04.63]That's why I didn't want to just... I was going to move on after I got out of the dungeon.
[59:12.20]And then what did he do?
[59:13.66]I got on the horse.
[59:16.32]And I rode it.
[59:17.84]For a little bit.
[59:20.26]I died a few times.
[59:23.70]And then the first... The last dream I got a woodland mansion on spawn.
[59:29.45]Why is your Minecraft, why is your luck so good?
[59:34.82]Didn't you guys ever hear the character sheet that Star made for me?
[59:39.36]I've said it before.
[59:40.14]10 charisma, 10 luck, 0 in every single other category.
[59:58.98]I would say I have, I gotta give myself at least a few points in strength.
[60:07.78]You know?
[60:08.88]I can't, I'm not just gonna have zero strength.
[60:18.14]But I don't know, sometimes there's, I don't know how. 2012.
[60:29.54]7 strength, 2 intelligence.
[60:34.68]What is the intelligence point level for at least an 8th grader?
[60:40.12]I have an at LEAST an 8th to 10th grade intelligence, to give me some credit.
[60:51.17]4?
[60:51.87]I'll take a 4 or 5, or abs- definitely, I'll take a 4 or 5 in intelligence.
[60:57.91]Anything below 8 is an animal.
[61:00.21]Is animal level.
[61:01.15]What?
[61:06.05]But if that is true, if that really was one of the rarest Minecraft events you could ever see... I... That's cool.
[61:15.86]I'm happy to have been able to show it then.
[61:21.52]Hey, The Jack, thanks for the $5.
[61:23.06]Everyone in chat only hates the Rick and Morty VR because of their low IQ scores.
[61:32.60]Rick and Morty.
[61:39.92]Thank you.
[61:40.32]Get dunked on!
[61:45.93]Hey, Jerma, I did a rat's mashup.
[61:48.29]Really hope you like it.
[61:49.07]Oh, let's see.
[61:58.15]Rat's mashup.
[62:07.04]Oh man, this sounds elaborate.
[62:08.80]Yeah, I'll just show it.
[62:39.44]Might as well just put it on screen, right?
[62:45.48]We don't.
[63:21.92]Let's go speed it up
[63:59.65]Shut up.
[64:00.41]Alright, Michael.
[64:01.03]We're here on your special day.
[64:03.03]Mom, shut up.
[64:04.25]I get all the presents, and Kathy doesn't get any, because she's an idiot.
[64:08.69]Come on, Michael.
[64:09.29]You ruin your fucking birthday every year for everybody else.
[64:12.21]Let me get it.
[64:12.79]That's right.
[64:13.61]It's my birthday today, not anybody else's.
[64:15.73]It's my birthday.
[64:16.39]Alright, Michael.
[64:17.03]Calm down.
[64:17.73]Did you hear what they just said?
[64:19.03]Now hold on just a second.
[64:20.11]Pause the movie.
[64:20.93]Hit pause.
[64:24.25]We just danced together as a family for one song.
[64:26.73]Rats, rats, we got a rat.
[64:38.54]iPod iPod commercial
[64:52.56]Welcome to the dog capital.
[64:57.03]I trust you're alright.
[64:58.45]In that case, Walker can talk with you.
[65:02.01]It's pretty good filler content.
[65:03.25]Nothing like some shit to find a dirty toothbrush.
[65:05.47]Greg, this is just to make sure you understand the story.
[65:07.45]Fucking day off as well.
[65:08.84]What is this voice for this character, by the way?
[65:37.15]I know exactly who we can sell these to.
[65:39.94]Friends, we are the friends.
[66:08.52]Who's this in the car?
[66:09.38]What TV show is this?
[66:11.08]Come on, Michael.
[66:11.98]You're on your fucking birthday every year for everybody else.
[66:18.73]Let me get it.
[66:19.75]I went through so much trouble to get you this.
[66:22.15]I know what you like.
[66:22.93]We just danced together as a family for months.
[66:32.64]What the fuck?
[66:41.83]Wow Shocking That's a real shock right there That was ridiculous That was very very very good
[67:10.44]Thank you so much for that.
[67:11.28]That was very well put together.
[67:13.64]That was Get Dunked On, by the way.
[67:27.41]It was absolutely perfect.
[67:31.47]Thank you so much, Get Dunked On.
[67:33.39]Glad we got to see it on stream.
[67:37.47]And then we had $3 from Al Store H2O.
[67:41.55]Thank you for the three bucks.
[67:43.41]Hey, Jerma, for the first time since I started making videos for fun, I'm trying to record an audio track for a video.
[67:48.52]The thing is, I don't think my voice is pleasant enough, and I don't think I can physically convey the emotion needed for the video.
[67:55.48]What do you do to get the right voice and emotion for your jokes and videos?
[67:58.68]And is it okay to just give up and try to work without one if I can't make it work?
[68:03.63]Thanks, and I hope you have a great night.
[68:07.68]Well, there's three or four kind of just probably two or three actual questions in here.
[68:14.37]And the first one I would tell you is if you're talking about recording voice lines.
[68:26.84]Almost every single thing you've ever heard me say, all the voices you've ever heard were based on somebody in real life or somebody that I've heard before.
[68:37.02]Grandpa is actually based on... Grandpa voice, this one here.
[68:41.90]Grandpa, this one, is based on my actual fucking grandmother.
[68:46.03]That's how my grandmother talked.
[68:49.83]And I would just imitate all her friends.
[68:55.07]That is my grandmother's voice.
[68:56.47]And I think a lot of it comes from observing and imitating.
[69:07.88]Whether it's somebody that's a celebrity or a friend of yours that talks in a certain way, has certain cadences, picking up on mannerisms and cadences is actually potentially more important than having a voice sound different.
[69:26.18]Especially if you're trying to do voices.
[69:35.84]But for the second part of that, it just comes to practice.
[69:39.80]And look, I'll be real.
[69:41.66]I'll be completely, completely real.
[69:43.80]You mentioned, is it okay to try to work without one or to just give up if I can't make it work?
[69:50.71]If everybody has something they can do, right?
[69:55.55]And even if, let's just say, for instance, if you're really into voice work, you really love voice acting, you love cartoons, you love voiceover artists, you live and breathe in something you fucking love so much.
[70:09.06]There are other jobs in that industry that aren't necessarily recording the voice work.
[70:15.62]You don't have to be the one that's producing the sound out of your mouth.
[70:19.58]You can be an engineer, you can be a writer, you can be an audio technician, you can work in the field.
[70:27.87]And I think a lot of people maybe get a little caught up in needing to do that one specific thing, right?
[70:38.46]When that one specific thing has a lot of branches with a ton of leaves on them that are different things to do in that field that will scratch the same itch from doing the thing that you really wanted to do in the first place.
[71:03.05]But that's not to say to, oh, just give up.
[71:05.11]Give up on your dreams.
[71:05.99]No.
[71:07.21]Give them a try.
[71:08.73]Go for it.
[71:13.08]But there's more than just that one thing.
[71:16.84]There's a lot more.
[71:25.72]Hope that answers your question.
[71:33.48]Look, if people gave up on their dreams, we wouldn't have half of the shit that we have in society today.
[71:40.89]Half of the stuff that we like, that we all know, that we care about, probably wouldn't even exist at all if everybody was like, nah, you know what, forget it.
[72:00.51]But thank you so much.
[72:01.51]I wish you the best of luck.
[72:03.19]That was Al Storr.
[72:04.17]Thank you, Al Storr.
[72:04.75]I also have to remember that half of following your dreams is luck.
[72:14.04]Yeah, it's a lot of factors.
[72:16.06]It's a complex, complicated thing.
[72:19.72]And that is trying to live up to your dream.
[72:23.14]Because there are so many outside factors that are in play that you might not even be aware of.
[72:31.03]And luck plays a very, very large role.
[72:34.79]Being at the right place in the right moment, talking to the right person, somehow being in the right place at the right time.
[72:41.65]It means a lot.
[72:47.65]Yeah, you got it right there.
[72:49.33]Luck, hard work, talent, more.
[72:56.85]It's a complex mixture of a bunch of different things.
[73:10.68]But not necessarily when you're following a dream, you're usually following it because you have a plan in mind.
[73:15.18]You have factors that can influence your path towards that dream.
[73:20.60]Yeah, but I can tell you right now as a 33 going on 34 year old, plans always change.
[73:30.33]They just do.
[73:32.35]You might have the end goal in your eyes at what you want to do, but the plans are always changing.
[73:41.28]Stuff is always changing in a plan.
[73:43.60]Especially in a life goal.
[73:46.05]Because the way that I had my plan set out and the thing that I really cared about has warped and changed directions and moved around.
[73:54.81]The goal is still there.
[73:56.41]It's still there.
[73:58.13]But that path changes.
[73:59.89]And you might not even know you're on a different one.
[74:02.70]You might be doing something that you don't even understand until years later is a branch of a path that you were on in the beginning.
[74:15.61]Be flexible.
[74:16.53]Yeah, that's a really good point.
[74:32.14]Will I play Monster Rancher VR when it comes out?
[74:37.62]Yeah, whenever that is.
[74:45.27]And you could use that anywhere.
[74:48.15]Whatever your dream is, whatever you want to do, whatever the thing, the message here was about voice work, but apply that to anything.
[74:55.74]Apply that to anything that you want to do in your life.
[75:09.64]But thank you, Alstor.
[75:11.12]Good luck.
[75:12.78]And get dunked on again.
[75:13.72]We just touched upon the video that we just watched.
[75:16.06]You gave another five, six, seven almost dollars here.
[75:20.18]Thank you for that awesome video.
[75:23.95]Hey, FrodeanWeapon, thanks for the $2.50.
[75:25.03]I say it to your heart.
[75:30.93]Thank you.
[75:33.47]SereneFP, thanks for the $2.50.
[75:37.35]Yo, Jerma started regularly watching your streams exactly a year ago during your speedrun of Monster Rancher 2.
[75:41.99]Wanted to thank you for being one of the few streamers who can genuinely make me laugh.
[75:50.55]Yeah.
[75:53.55]I'm... I'm fucking grateful and thankful that you came.
[75:59.00]I'm glad you think the things I say are worth watching.
[76:04.49]Really appreciate that.
[76:05.89]And you bring up Monster Rancher.
[76:06.99]I actually think... I think I'm going to go back to Monster Rancher 2.
[76:12.00]I have this weird itch to play it.
[76:13.30]I don't know why.
[76:17.70]For some reason.
[76:18.70]It's just I feel like I want to do it again.
[76:23.87]Hey Magellan, thanks for the $5.
[76:25.93]Had a great time tonight, Jerma.
[76:26.90]Glad you decided to stick out Minecraft VR for a bit longer and make a session out of it.
[76:31.72]Definitely seems like you enjoyed it.
[76:33.64]Thank you for all the laughs and wonderful times you bring the community and I. Have fun with your friends in the next few days and rest up from all the VR.
[76:42.38]Thank you.
[76:45.16]I will.
[76:45.70]I will have a few days here where I'm going to
[76:51.52]I'm just going to take the days, you know?
[76:54.84]It's been a little nicer.
[76:56.08]It was really beautiful out today.
[76:58.92]Get some sun.
[77:00.28]Hang out with some friends.
[77:03.72]And there's a little bit of work I can get done as well in a couple of days.
[77:11.65]A little bit of not stream or video related type stuff.
[77:17.17]Just things that I've kind of been on the back burner that I have to get done.
[77:23.80]But thank you.
[77:30.57]Let me get a dork cube.
[77:31.59]Thanks for the 250 dork cube.
[77:34.69]Uh, you getting a rare spawn in Minecraft despite your love-hate relationship with the game reminds me of that Futurama episode where the professor accidentally disproves evolution.
[77:48.21]Yeah.
[77:52.52]That was a great show.
[77:57.52]This was such a perfect moment.
[77:58.72]You called exactly what was going to happen.
[78:00.59]What do you mean?
[78:07.62]What did I do?
[78:33.34]Like that was going to do anything.
[78:34.46]What's one of the four horsemen doing in here?
[78:36.88]What?
[78:45.99]It really did look like the four horsemen.
[78:51.16]That wave, though, that was like a giant lollipop.
[78:56.50]Get away from me.
[78:57.16]Get away.
[79:00.12]He summoned it.
[79:07.92]I have expected Metallica to start playing.
[79:11.94]That's so funny.
[79:18.41]But thank you.
[79:20.81]Thank you.
[79:21.11]That was Demonic Cucumber.
[79:22.05]Thank you.
[79:22.89]Anything else show official for the five bucks?
[79:28.38]You're the man.
[79:28.82]I've been working on a New Vegas mod for you and wanted to say thank you for the inspiration.
[79:32.86]All the models and stuff I've been working on are in the creative channel on Discord.
[79:36.78]I'm not finished with the mod, but I wanted to tell you that.
[79:39.21]My life has been busy and stressful and the mod and the streams is the one thing I've been excited about.
[79:45.55]I can't wait to see what you come up with.
[79:54.67]That's somebody making a mod.
[80:00.70]That's awesome.
[80:02.80]I sincerely fucking look forward to what it comes out.
[80:08.86]Thank you, Anything Show.
[80:10.50]Anything Else Show Official for the five bucks.
[80:13.88]And keep us updated, keep us posted on it.
[80:18.60]The Jack, thanks for five dollars, Jack.
[80:19.97]Do you actually, yourself, like the silly memes from years past that we still use or is it so detached to how you are now?
[80:28.77]No, I mean, all jokes aside, I... You know, they're locked away inside my heart there, in the chest pump thing that puts blood through into your brain and into your body.
[80:49.62]So, no, I don't hate old references and memes, because at some point...
[80:56.55]That means that this is like a living, breathing community.
[81:00.43]Right?
[81:01.11]That makes me happy to know that.
[81:04.17]That people are using references from years ago or things that they're coming up with.
[81:10.38]That means that we have a great community.
[81:12.52]That means we have a very active, lively community.
[81:23.98]But thank you, The Jack.
[81:27.23]I do not hate the memes, no.
[81:39.42]And thank you to Alstor.
[81:41.14]Again, $4.50 for Alstor.
[81:44.31]This is compensation for accidentally putting in so much in one message.
[81:49.37]I already spent like 25 to 30 hours on a video, so the voice work might be supplementary, and I think I'll be proud of it regardless.
[81:58.01]But I still needed to hear what you said, and I can't thank you enough.
[82:01.58]You're always so comforting and practical with life advice.
[82:09.68]I really wish that whatever you do, it's something that you like doing.
[82:14.79]It's something that you can enjoy, something that you can work on and be like, that was good.
[82:22.21]I liked that.
[82:22.93]I enjoyed that.
[82:34.25]Thank you so much, Alistair.
[82:39.49]And with that, we are going to run the credits.
[82:42.96]All the new subs and all the old subs.
[82:48.90]Coming on the screen right now.
[82:53.21]I will see you all on Wednesday.
[82:55.39]So three, so four days from now.
[82:59.27]Yeah.
[82:59.85]One, two, three.
[83:01.05]I'll see you on the 20th.
[83:14.30]I'm going to go take a bath and get some food.
[83:20.90]Have a great rest of your beginning of your weekend, right?
[83:24.56]Saturday.
[83:26.44]Still fairly early on Saturday, Pacific.
[83:29.05]Hopefully, you guys are going to enjoy your St.
[83:31.77]Patrick's Day, right?
[83:32.57]That's today, right?
[83:35.19]St.
[83:35.37]Patrick's Day is today, right?
[83:39.15]No, it's tomorrow.
[83:42.28]So, happy St.
[83:43.02]Patrick's Day for all of you.
[83:46.52]Let's celebrate tomorrow.
[83:51.47]It's Sunday afternoon here.
[83:52.75]Well, there you go.
[84:02.96]Happy St.
[84:03.58]Patrick's Day.
[84:04.44]Yeah.
[84:09.14]Highly recommend looking at the deluxe audio strap for the Vive.
[84:12.25]Makes tightening it up a lot easier and the headphones are on ears, so no worrying about them slipping out.
[84:17.69]Yeah, but it's also my problem too.
[84:19.21]I do want earphone because...
[84:23.67]I lost my mind.
[84:28.89]And I can't find it.
[84:31.15]No, I, for some reason, 10, 15 years ago, I came to this assumption that I cannot do two headphones in.
[84:38.86]And even with in-ear back, you know, the open back ones, it still just makes me feel claustrophobic.
[84:45.88]I don't know why.
[84:46.48]I'm just a weirdo.
[85:02.66]And then finally we had LeosBM came in right now with three bucks.
[85:07.02]Three dollars.
[85:10.13]I just resubbed.
[85:11.41]Can't donate on mobile, but I thought I'd ask... I'd like to ask this here.
[85:15.65]I've always liked to do impressions of people, like you said, and seen you as an inspiration.
[85:20.49]I know I want to do something with that talent, and streaming seems great, but I feel like it's too late to get into it at this point.
[85:26.39]Do you think that being a comedy streamer is something that I could viably pursue?
[85:31.38]Thanks.
[85:34.74]Um, it's, it's hard to answer that question because the content and what people want to see and what people watch, it's hard to say, Hey, that material is going to work.
[85:46.69]That material won't work.
[85:48.17]You need to do this for material.
[85:56.27]It's a hard question to answer because on one hand you have the true just reality of Twitch, right?
[86:04.87]And that's thousands and thousands and thousands of broadcasters all at the same time.
[86:10.32]All going, all trying to get people on their streams.
[86:13.18]And hey, come to my stream.
[86:14.40]Hang on to my stream.
[86:16.08]Look what I'm doing.
[86:16.66]I'm doing something here.
[86:17.38]I'm playing this game.
[86:18.00]You like that game, right?
[86:19.18]It's a lot.
[86:20.58]So trying to differentiate yourself and put yourself out there as it's very difficult to do.
[86:28.46]But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try to do it.
[86:32.71]Just make sure you be realistic.
[86:35.80]Make sure that you are doing it because you want to.
[86:39.36]And it's something that you want to do.
[86:40.96]It's something that you care about.
[86:42.86]Not something that you're doing because you think you have to.
[86:52.03]And you can take that last conversation we had about it and apply it to this too.
[87:06.38]You need to enjoy it regardless of how many people watch.
[87:08.88]Yeah, you have to just... When I made my first five YouTube videos, I didn't... I just was doing them because I wanted to do them.
[87:21.03]That seems like fun.
[87:21.99]That seems interesting.
[87:23.03]That seems like something I think is really cool.
[87:24.94]That's something I want to try to do.
[87:30.78]The only rule is you can't stream when Jerma is streaming.
[87:34.10]You dig?
[87:37.43]Now it's all about the money.
[87:43.53]Now, the thing is, though, you'll never know unless you try.
[87:48.41]You can't fail unless you try.
[87:51.25]I was thinking about that, but I didn't.
[87:54.97]I think I just would fail at it.
[87:56.99]Just do it.
[87:59.41]There's no reason not to try it.
[88:08.53]And, you know, networking goes a long way.
[88:12.44]Hanging out, you know, trying to help out in other people's streams.
[88:15.88]Finding similar interests and collaborating.
[88:18.58]And only if people want to collaborate, right?
[88:21.08]Like, you never want to throw yourself into a situation where you're like, Hey, what's going on?
[88:24.68]How are you?
[88:25.89]Uh, I see that you do this too.
[88:27.45]Let's do a video tomorrow.
[88:28.65]Like, that's, which is natural, right?
[88:38.78]The only way to get up, the only way to get up is to fall down sometimes.
[88:41.22]Yeah.
[88:45.69]Go watch my first 50 YouTube videos and tell me that like I didn't figure out more things to try and did some things wrong or maybe I shouldn't have uploaded that video because was that video really any, was that video good?
[89:01.96]And what was my latest videos from like the last, you know, obviously two years ago.
[89:07.34]You learn, you grow, and you keep trying.
[89:17.12]Yeah, go watch my latest videos from two and a half years ago.
[89:27.31]But I wish you the best of luck.
[89:30.31]Is it Leos or Leo?
[89:31.99]It's probably Leo SSBM.
[89:34.95]I think I called you Leos.
[89:42.88]Yeah, but you can't figure out what you want to do until you try to start doing it in the first place.
[89:48.27]Everybody has this big painting that they have.
[89:51.71]And it's... There's a giant canvas on the wall.
[89:55.63]It's an empty canvas.
[89:57.15]And it's just sitting up there.
[89:58.31]And it's... I can't wait for this painting.
[90:01.15]It's gonna be... Look at this fucking huge painting.
[90:03.57]Oh, there's the Mona Lisa's gonna be there, like, flying.
[90:06.85]And over there... There's a cheetah that's gonna be over there.
[90:09.83]There's a jungle...
[90:11.67]But it's like, you gotta start painting.
[90:13.81]Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, but, like, look at the cheetah!
[90:15.97]The cheetah's, like, coming out there from the jungle!
[90:19.79]And then you go, and you start on the cheetah, and everyone's like, alright, man, like, can't wait to see the huge, you know, 15 by 15 foot mural on the wall.
[90:28.63]And then you start painting the fucking cheetah portion.
[90:31.43]Maybe you start painting the tree, and it's a little bit of brown paint, and it looks like a little smudge.
[90:42.34]Eventually that little sponge turns into the bark and that bark turns into the branches that branches turns into the tree and then that tree turns into the cheetah and Then the cheetah turns into the Mona Lisa You have to start painting Somebody said you lost me point is everybody has a big picture of
[91:08.63]that they want to paint well maybe not everybody but a lot of people have this big painting and you have to close down a little and remember you have to start you have to start painting that painting and it's not going to look like the painting that you think it is until it's done potentially months or years later start small and put realistic goals in front of yourself just use a spray can
[91:47.30]But that's my time.
[91:49.36]I will see you guys on Wednesday.
[91:51.26]Have a great rest of your weekend.
[91:57.43]Take care, all of you.
[92:03.31]See you on Wednesday.
[92:07.05]Ta-ta.
[92:09.73]Goodbye.
[92:20.64]Oh, and, uh... Wait, was somebody's birthday?
[92:23.88]Somebody's birthday?
[92:26.85]Happy birthday.
[92:28.11]Was it Bath?
[92:29.37]Happy birthday tomorrow.
[92:30.91]On St.
[92:31.29]Patrick's Day.
[92:34.97]Have a good one.
[92:36.90]See you Wednesday.
