[00:00.67]What's up?
[00:01.71]Hi.
[00:02.03]Hey, how's it going?
[00:03.13]What's up?
[00:03.85]You're on my show.
[00:05.26]Yeah, I'm here.
[00:05.96]I'm on the show.
[00:06.96]And we're back in the green screen room also.
[00:08.76]We should have said we're on the roller coaster.
[00:10.78]Oh, yeah, you're right.
[00:12.02]We're on a roller coaster.
[00:14.74]This looks just... I can't imagine this in raw footage.
[00:17.39]Keep your hands inside.
[00:18.31]I'm sorry.
[00:18.87]But that's what the person said.
[00:20.37]Okay, okay.
[00:21.67]We're at a lake.
[00:30.51]I completely forgot to do the intro, so let me do that real quick.
[00:33.15]Oh.
[00:33.41]Welcome back to TBH with JHB.
[00:34.63]My name is JHB, and today I have Jerma here on the show with me.
[00:37.29]How's it going, Jerma?
[00:38.10]I'm doing great.
[00:38.78]How are you?
[00:39.24]Good.
[00:39.70]I'm going to ask you a series of questions, like a normal interview, and you're going to answer them.
[00:43.20]Okay.
[00:43.58]We first met at the Streamer Awards.
[00:50.08]The first question I wanted to ask... Just give me one second.
[00:51.78]Okay.
[00:54.83]There's no opportunity to take a drink during an interview.
[00:57.61]Should I throw this away?
[00:58.83]What should I do with this?
[01:00.69]The first question I wanted to ask is, have you seen my show before?
[01:02.97]I've seen kind of like the, there's a lot of like sound effects.
[01:06.68]Yes.
[01:07.40]I've never watched a single episode of the show.
[01:09.06]Joe Biden, maybe, was he on here?
[01:10.66]I interviewed Gunna.
[01:11.78]Yeah?
[01:12.16]The push and pee guy.
[01:14.32]Oh, okay.
[01:14.63]Yeah.
[01:16.18]Yeah.
[01:17.94]Look, I'm 37.
[01:19.84]And by the way, again, thank you so much for inviting me to your favorite coffee shop.
[01:24.26]Oh, no worries.
[01:25.32]What's your favorite type of coffee?
[01:26.88]This is your favorite coffee shop.
[01:28.08]This is not my favorite coffee shop.
[01:29.34]If I'm at a Starbucks, I'll get a Frappuccino.
[01:32.98]What kind of Frappuccino?
[01:33.74]There's a bunch of different kinds.
[01:34.72]I don't remember the name of it.
[01:37.06]It's your favorite coffee.
[01:38.24]There's like a Mocha Frappuccino.
[01:39.38]There's like a Vanilla Frappuccino.
[01:40.48]Mocha Frappuccino.
[01:41.16]I got a Mocha Frappuccino.
[01:41.88]There it is.
[01:42.26]Okay, okay.
[01:42.54]So your favorite coffee is a Mocha Frappuccino.
[01:44.98]What's yours?
[01:46.04]Let's just throw up.
[01:46.92]Venti, which is a large.
[01:48.52]Yes.
[01:49.06]Iced coffee, not cold brew, way too much caffeine in a cold brew with a splash of oat milk and three pumps of toffee nut.
[01:56.01]What is toffee nut?
[01:56.81]You ever have a Heath bar?
[01:57.91]What?
[01:58.27]You ever have a Heath bar?
[01:59.23]I don't know what a Heath bar is.
[02:00.11]Is he the only person in this room that hasn't had a Heath bar?
[02:02.15]James, I need you to make an Instagram story.
[02:04.05]Yes.
[02:04.49]Do your job, please.
[02:05.07]Okay.
[02:06.07]Like right now?
[02:06.91]Oh God, that's what my hair looks like.
[02:10.68]Like you're doing it right now.
[02:12.68]Yeah.
[02:12.94]Check out the new TVH or JHV episode.
[02:14.58]I'm filming it right now, but it should already be out because, you know, we come out with content.
[02:18.14]Hey, content.
[02:19.92]You'll see it soon.
[02:21.13]I just looked like a hundred years old.
[02:22.35]What was that?
[02:22.81]Are we good?
[02:23.77]Yeah.
[02:24.13]Alright.
[02:24.81]I'm going to warm my hands up.
[02:25.61]There's a nice fire here.
[02:26.65]I'm going to warm my hands up for this.
[02:28.09]No, actually, hold on.
[02:28.83]It's back here.
[02:29.43]Climate change.
[02:30.87]Thoughts?
[02:31.15]This is a hot question.
[02:33.11]Alright.
[02:33.43]I thought we were going to talk about like clouds.
[02:35.19]It's definitely one of those things.
[02:37.82]This is a prop chair.
[02:38.44]I'm going down soon.
[02:39.28]There's conflicting rumors all over the internet debating on if you're a real person or not.
[02:42.72]And I just wanted to ask personally if you were real.
[02:45.34]Put your hand out.
[02:48.38]Did you feel that?
[02:49.60]It tickled, yeah.
[02:50.30]Do you want to prove that I exist?
[02:52.02]Alright.
[02:52.30]Look, with the way that AI and voice AI, like, who knows?
[02:57.21]In a hundred years, think about your great, great, great, great grandfather, right?
[03:01.37]The only thing that you know about your great, great, great, great, great grandfather is he made shoes.
[03:06.47]Can you imagine if you could watch your, like, great, great, great, great grandfather give, like, you know, do TikToks on making shoes?
[03:12.80]That'd be f***ing crazy.
[03:13.80]That would be awesome, yeah.
[03:14.96]That's going to happen to you.
[03:16.42]Hey, great, great, great, great grandkids.
[03:18.44]There he is.
[03:19.04]What do you have to say to them?
[03:19.92]Okay, first off, I'm sorry.
[03:21.42]By the way, can I just say, I really appreciate bringing me to the beach.
[03:24.37]Yeah, no worries.
[03:25.91]It was very hot out.
[03:27.73]But you didn't have any sunscreen on, and I just wanted to put it on.
[03:30.29]It's kind of cloudy.
[03:31.17]It can go through clouds.
[03:32.59]They look seagulls.
[03:33.59]I know, I know.
[03:34.13]They're so cool.
[03:34.85]He's on his phone again.
[03:38.80]What?
[03:39.04]I said he's on his phone again.
[03:40.70]I've been asking the questions.
[03:43.29]What is it?
[03:43.57]What is it?
[03:43.99]How many years were you a freelance wedding videographer?
[03:47.92]How dare you?
[03:48.52]Probably like two, three years.
[03:49.52]Was that during your YouTube era or before that?
[03:51.40]A little bit before.
[03:52.32]Okay.
[03:52.68]And then substitute teacher.
[03:54.14]When did that come?
[03:54.66]Bringing up every job I've ever had.
[03:56.12]Yeah, I literally knew less than the kids.
[03:58.29]There's kids in their f***ing phones.
[04:03.31]Who is that?
[04:04.89]Like mom, right?
[04:12.13]No, that's not important.
[04:14.62]Just wait till it ends.
[04:16.70]Wait, how do I...
[04:20.02]My pants are too tight.
[04:20.96]I can't take on the phone.
[04:21.82]Is this three stars?
[04:25.44]Why is this still going?
[04:26.40]What's your favorite food?
[04:27.94]Can I do some questions?
[04:28.84]What kind of food do I look like?
[04:30.77]Your favorite food is a buffalo chicken sub with blue cheese and provolone cheese on it.
[04:35.05]I don't like provolone cheese, but I do like blue cheese.
[04:36.59]Well, that's my favorite food.
[04:37.59]Oh, okay.
[04:38.15]Do you know who I think has completely risen to the top?
[04:41.79]Who?
[04:42.11]In like the kind of fat, not like fast food, but like that in between fat, like shake, shake, you know, whatever.
[04:46.53]Jack in the Box.
[04:47.23]Nope.
[04:49.65]Five Guys, I think, has become my favorite quick burger.
[04:54.02]Would you punch me in the face if I said that I don't really, like, I don't care for In-N-Out?
[04:57.22]I mean, I like In-N-Out, but I'm not going to punch you.
[04:58.82]I mean, they'll think you're going to punch me.
[05:00.68]Somebody back there is... No, I didn't.
[05:02.74]I don't hate it.
[05:03.60]Don't please.
[05:04.66]I need a perfect... Oh, you like this too?
[05:07.32]A perfect ratio.
[05:09.67]Meat to bun has got no more than, like, a half inch.
[05:13.09]Sorry, I laughed at ratio.
[05:15.67]Why?
[05:16.65]Like Twitter.
[05:17.21]What does that mean?
[05:18.41]L plus ratio.
[05:20.85]L plus ratio.
[05:22.47]Probably should be a little quiet.
[05:23.59]We're in a movie, for God's sake.
[05:24.91]Probably should be quiet about this.
[05:26.07]I mean, we've been talking this whole movie.
[05:27.80]We'll be done in like, I don't know, 10 minutes.
[05:30.06]Yeah.
[05:30.30]Shh.
[05:30.88]Don't worry.
[05:31.28]This movie sucks anyway.
[05:32.52]Can you explain the Dollhouse series that you did on stream?
[05:35.44]Because that was a very interesting time.
[05:37.82]A sentence?
[05:38.50]That was some of the most fun I've ever had in my entire life.
[05:40.25]You probably can't say, but do you have any ideas on what you want to do for the next one?
[05:43.11]I do.
[05:43.73]Have you written it down already?
[05:44.99]I'm going to dodge a battle axe on stream.
[05:46.51]You're going to what?
[05:48.11]I'm going to dodge a battle axe on stream.
[05:50.72]Are you excited?
[05:51.46]Yeah.
[05:51.68]Wow.
[05:52.58]What would you say the budgeting is for something like that?
[05:54.62]You want to stack hundreds on the floor and get to the ceiling?
[05:56.92]If you stacked hundreds on top of each other and you got to the ceiling, how much money would it be?
[06:03.97]In the millions, right?
[06:05.25]7.3 mil.
[06:05.53]That was good.
[06:06.10]Thank you.
[06:06.66]You like counted.
[06:07.38]I saw that.
[06:08.24]You were like calculating in your head.
[06:09.58]It was like... I just recently started to get some true sponsors because I don't know how familiar you are with the long term of the last 10 to 12 years of the channel, but I did not take sponsors at all.
[06:20.23]So trying to get that money as still an independent kind of person is hard.
[06:26.39]Do you like JBL?
[06:27.61]What's JBL?
[06:28.73]There's sponsors.
[06:31.34]JBL.
[06:32.22]Of course I love JBL.
[06:34.08]A fantastic partner to work with.
[06:38.50]It's a audio company.
[06:39.89]And man, they make great boom boxes.
[06:43.87]Oh, it's actually here.
[06:45.21]The thing I love about these, so the JBL Quantum TWUs, it's got true adaptive noise canceling.
[06:50.73]So let's say you're on a plane.
[06:52.24]You want to just vibe out on the plane because you're excited for your trip.
[06:54.60]So you play some celebratory music.
[06:56.10]They better be JBLs, my favorite.
[06:57.58]Well, I got news for you.
[07:00.44]Whoa!
[07:01.14]Wow, there actually are in my hands!
[07:02.86]JBL Quantum!
[07:05.93]Am I ruining this?
[07:07.13]Perfect calls?
[07:08.25]So you'd be in business meetings for your shows.
[07:10.39]I don't like to have the big kind of earmuffs.
[07:13.97]You know when you close your ears?
[07:15.11]Yeah, so you just lose focus.
[07:16.71]Yeah, you just hear that kind of like... Let me see how these are.
[07:21.84]Oh, hold on a second.
[07:22.68]You know, I'm a stickler.
[07:24.54]I like that.
[07:24.94]They got a nice weight to them.
[07:26.62]It clearly says what ear.
[07:28.16]There you go.
[07:28.98]I hate that.
[07:31.20]Sometimes it's not clearly labeled.
[07:32.98]Comfortable.
[07:33.72]Comfortable.
[07:34.48]That's comfortable.
[07:35.18]Try the other one.
[07:38.92]Okay, so.
[07:43.02]What happened?
[07:43.74]Yeah.
[07:43.96]Do you have any powers?
[07:52.05]Turn the lights off.
[07:53.71]Turn the lights back on.
[07:59.01]Why did I run?
[08:00.21]Hey, John.
[08:01.55]Oh, John, how are you?
[08:02.68]I didn't know what to call you.
[08:03.64]Yeah, I'm Jerma.
[08:05.20]Everybody knows Jerma.

[08:52.31]Yeah.
[08:52.77]But your rock is way more comfortable.
[08:54.61]Well, that's just because I'm leaning on it like this, but it's actually not that comfortable.
[08:57.39]Yeah.
[08:57.55]Oh, alright.
