[00:01.67]Hey.
[00:04.01]Howdy.
[00:04.39]Phone call was good.
[00:07.77]I just, I had to take care of something.
[00:09.71]Something I didn't know that I had to take care of, but I did have to take care of it, so I took care of it.
[00:16.71]Welcome to Dreamcast Day 2 of the Dreamcast Stream Central.
[00:29.84]taken care of.
[00:31.65]Give me one second.
[00:32.15]I've got to tweak that.
[00:34.86]I'll see you guys in a moment.
[01:26.81]Alright.
[01:28.97]Good afternoon.
[01:32.59]Good evening.
[01:34.19]All those things.
[01:39.14]I remember this screen.
[01:40.02]I don't know why we're getting this screen again.
[01:43.36]But it's a good place for us to test the audio, because I know a lot of people said last, uh, last-er-day night that it was out of sync.
[01:51.81]So let's go ahead and see if we can get it in sync.
[01:54.37]Are you ready?
[01:59.17]Here we go.
[02:02.99]You should be hearing my voice and the sound at the same time.
[02:07.59]And here we, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1.
[02:10.33]Voice is behind, okay.
[02:28.10]So the voice is behind.
[02:31.65]Really.
[02:35.09]What if I give you one of these?
[02:35.93]One, two, three, four, eight.
[02:38.89]Bape, bape, bape, bape, bape, bape.
[02:42.54]There.
[02:49.18]The voice is still behind.
[02:50.42]The voice is too early now.
[02:54.71]No, no way.
[03:00.30]Hold on.
[03:07.64]What if we do a little thing like this?
[03:09.56]One, two, three, four.
[03:11.64]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.
[03:17.62]Alright.
[03:26.49]Good, good, good.
[03:27.63]Perfect, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[03:29.98]The game is a bit behind.
[03:30.96]Well, I can fix that too.
[03:31.94]Check this out.
[03:33.82]I have a ton of magic tricks here.
[03:36.58]You ready?
[03:38.80]How about this one?
[03:40.32]One, two, three, four, five.
[03:42.52]Welcome to the troubleshooting stream.
[03:44.20]Four, six, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, one, two, three.
[03:58.39]Oh, the first game, by the way, is the worst one.
[04:00.48]I need to get it out of the way as fast as I can.
[04:05.92]I saw it on the table and I said, I don't want to play this.
[04:08.60]Why did I buy this?
[04:11.86]It's not the Evolution game.
[04:12.94]It's the fucking worst game ever.
[04:14.87]It was just a Dreamcast exclusive.
[04:16.43]That's the only reason why I bought it.
[04:22.37]Never mind.
[04:22.85]I take back everything I just said.
[04:47.02]His mouth is even doing... You know, I'm glad we got to see at least this part here.
[04:53.74]There's this toy commander.
[05:14.52]Who gave that little kid explosives?
[05:17.18]It's supposed to be a... It's him imagining things?
[05:20.18]Running around in his house?
[05:21.58]Alright, so... I wouldn't do that.
[05:47.99]Andy, the time has come.
[05:49.05]We toys are sick and tired of how you use us, then toss us aside.
[05:56.59]As I, Huggy Bear, claim the title of Toy Commander.
[06:01.13]So this is Toy Story 5.
[06:09.21]This is the Toys Rise Up.
[06:11.31]And, like, strangle old Andy.
[06:17.34]While he's in his sleep or something.
[06:25.43]Yeah, it's the trip to the nursing home to find Andy.
[06:30.97]W6Y... I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[06:33.45]It's three letters.
[06:43.55]I don't care.
[06:47.53]Boy, that's Andy.
[06:55.22]A lot of, uh, don't give a shit about copyright in some of these Dreamcast games.
[07:02.24]Not even copyright, but, like, referencing other, like, Western media for some reason, right?
[07:14.19]No, my point is like, we had the whole Family Guy cast in the last game.
[07:19.99]For some reason.
[07:22.75]And I was like, Andy, toy game, Andy.
[07:30.11]Okay, so let's do 16 by 9.
[07:43.01]I'm not sure this is going to do anything.
[07:52.57]Is this game older than Toy Story?
[07:54.23]No, no way.
[07:55.01]Dude, you don't have a game about toys.
[08:00.70]This looks awful now.
[08:02.40]It just looks like I stretched it out.
[08:05.24]Whatever, who cares.
[08:06.10]Kitchen and dining room.
[08:08.84]The rest of the house is coming soon.
[08:10.52]All we have is the dining room.
[08:16.39]our shelf open the draw house okay kitchen and dining room training boiling rage I am cyclone and I am the boss of the kitchen each room in this house has its own boss if you can beat our records in at least four missions you'll be tested against us if you defeat us we'll become your allies then you can pilot us in the final duel against the toy commander
[08:43.70]Land the plane on the runway, then use the helicopter to drop two sugar lumps into the cup of hot cocoa.
[08:49.69]Finally, use the pickup truck to find the chocolate bar.
[08:53.75]I'm liking the Pee Wee Herman quests.
[08:59.47]Holy shit, Jerma, this game is my whole childhood.
[09:01.67]I never could remember its name.
[09:04.95]Well, it is Toy Commander.
[09:06.31]I'm glad you could see it and figure it out.
[09:12.46]How do you fly?
[09:13.90]Okay, right trigger is fly.
[09:16.32]Alright, so what do I have to do?
[09:24.84]Grab the sugar.
[09:25.34]Open world.
[09:37.90]This is the kitchen from Rat Movie.
[09:41.22]It kind of is.
[09:43.58]Alright, grab the sugar.
[09:47.58]No, land on the runway.
[09:48.82]Land on the runway, okay.
[10:02.79]Oh!
[10:03.81]I didn't get it?
[10:19.11]Stop!
[10:22.31]How am I not on the runway?
[10:29.31]Land on the runway.
[10:30.23]This is the runway, right?
[10:35.97]Did I not land on the runway?
[10:41.84]Okay, well let's go ahead and get the sugar.
[10:47.44]How do I open it?
[11:01.21]How does it want me to open the sugar thing?
[11:08.67]I'm gonna throw up if I play this for more than a few minutes, I think.
[11:26.86]Oh wait, what about that?
[11:27.86]Switch planes.
[11:30.22]Alright, land in the cup.
[11:36.76]How do I switch planes?
[11:43.84]What?
[11:46.08]How do I change vehicles?
[12:01.96]Okay.
[12:03.14]How do I get out?
[12:04.06]Okay, it's apparently X. Come on, you're not even gonna tell me the controls of the game?
[12:26.13]Alright, I gotta lift up this thing.
[12:32.68]What button is that?
[12:35.96]What button is, like, lift up sugar thing?
[12:39.70]The sugar isn't there.
[12:41.54]What?
[12:43.40]Look at the mini-map.
[12:44.81]That's not the sugar?
[12:45.59]I thought, no, I'm supposed to put the sugar into the cocoa.
[13:07.31]There's no... Where's the sugar?
[13:08.59]Wait, so what the hell is the other... Look at the mini-map!
[13:23.12]What's that for?
[13:25.56]What is that even for?
[13:26.96]Look at the other mini-map.
[13:28.16]Why is it on the sugar bowl?
[13:43.42]It's inverted fucking throw-up controls, by the way.
[13:55.03]Name of song.
[13:57.77]You really care about the song?
[14:16.39]Okay, got it.
[14:21.77]Pick up the chocolate candy.
[14:31.14]It's harder to fly this than I think it is to fly a helicopter in GTA 4 with the mouse and keyboard.
[14:52.47]I gotta change to the truck?
[14:56.76]I'm about to run out of time.
[15:06.08]Tha- How do I just change to the truck?
[15:21.70]Time is gas.
[15:23.78]Land on chocolate.
[15:26.48]Yeah, I can't change off the helicopter.
[15:57.00]This is supposed to be tutorial, but in my mind, this is how you control the game.
[16:05.32]There is no explanation as to how to change vehicles.
[16:09.14]It said, go pick up the sugar, and then pick up the cocoa, and pick up the cat poo.
[16:23.21]I don't have a, there's no, I don't have a manual.
[16:26.78]Read the manual!
[16:27.72]I bought this used and it came in a black fucking box!
[16:32.72]Alright, I pressed X last time and it didn't do that.
[16:43.04]Where the fuck am I supposed to go from here?
[16:44.46]I'm just on the table.
[17:20.50]Got him.
[17:21.38]Does the cat do anything?
[17:35.38]I don't- okay.
[17:36.38]Why- why?
[17:40.16]The truck is definitely more fun than the helicopter.
[17:53.32]So, do I have to pick up the truck?
[17:56.92]Because the only other indicator on the MIDI map is up there.
[18:00.00]So do I pick up the truck and put... The entire game is this level.
[18:01.98]No, it's not.
[18:38.34]I would have loved this as a kid.
[18:39.47]So probably I would have too.
[18:43.99]Now where's the cat box?
[18:59.43]There's a yellow ramp against the wall.
[19:01.53]What?
[19:11.80]Where's the yellow ramp?
[19:18.73]Am I actually blind?
[19:19.91]There's a yellow ramp against the wall.
[19:23.45]No, you guys are horseshitting me here.
[19:27.40]A yellow ramp that goes up against the wall.
[19:33.32]You guys are shitting me right now.
[19:34.76]No way.
[19:36.42]Which wall is there a yellow ramp?
[19:41.37]No, that's not a ramp.
[19:42.59]That's a half pipe.
[19:44.21]Not even.
[19:44.71]This is not going to do anything.
[19:46.85]Why does this work?
[19:48.31]How would you have ever known this was going to work?
[19:50.19]There's no laws of physics to explain why I'd be able to drive up the wall and stay on here.
[19:54.62]There's no fucking way.
[19:58.02]Somebody in chat looked up the guide and figured it out.
[20:07.51]Go up the little tiny half track and drive up the wall and drive on the ceiling.
[20:15.20]Oh my god, I'm looking at chat.
[20:16.82]I did it.
[20:17.22]I win.
[20:28.88]Kid logic.
[20:31.78]No one would ever do that.
[20:33.12]No kid's gonna do that.
[20:55.61]When you guys are saying ramp, I thought you were talking about an actual ramp that could take me driving on a regular plane with real physics, not go up the small yellow McDonald's symbol, drive up the wall.
[21:12.82]If my dad... I'm glad my kid wouldn't fucking understand that.
[21:16.40]Because he would be... He'd be logic about it.
[21:20.40]He'd be asking me, Dad, I don't see a ramp that an actual, you know, in real life that you'd be... I'd be like, son, me either.
[21:27.85]I'd pat him on the head.
[21:38.53]I didn't even read the instructions.
[21:41.27]You've managed thus far, but you're nothing unless you can cook.
[21:44.14]Drop the eggs into the water and don't forget to light the stove.
[21:48.90]Okay, I'm ready.
[21:53.50]I need to pick up eggs.
[22:02.60]Alright, hold on.
[22:03.60]Where are the eggs?
[22:04.42]Does it say where they are?
[22:06.85]Drop the eggs in the water.
[22:08.07]That's all we get.
[22:17.86]I don't think that's an egg.
[22:18.66]That's a lighter, though.
[22:19.52]I feel like I have to get the other tank up there.
[22:23.46]That's fuel.
[22:24.42]Alright, eggs.
[22:25.23]Fridge?
[22:27.29]If I were a bunch of eggs, I'd be in the fridge.
[22:35.47]No, there's eggs right here.
[22:42.13]Alright, so I need to switch...
[22:50.03]Because unless I go and land and push them into the water from this side... This level's not going to take 12 minutes.
[23:00.94]Got it.
[23:09.42]Okay, they got one.
[23:15.11]Time to beat is 1 minute and 30.
[23:16.33]Yeah, but you're not expected to do that first try.
[23:19.17]It takes a minute to figure out where the eggs even are.
[23:28.22]Oh my god, throw up controls.
[23:33.20]I need, I need like a joystick.
[23:49.66]This is Toy Commander, if you're wondering.
[23:51.83]That hit sucks!
[23:54.45]Alright, now it's gonna light the fuse.
[24:08.62]Stop, stop, stop, stop!
[24:18.07]Oh my god.
[24:18.71]Do I need to land on a special children's runway?
[24:21.59]Is that what this is?
[24:24.57]Do I have to find the one spot where I'm allowed to land?
[24:27.55]Oh, don't worry guys.
[24:38.08]I found a way.
[24:39.76]Just blew my...
[24:49.00]Ah, stop!
[24:49.90]Inverted, stop, please!
[25:03.37]That was for nothing.
[25:04.41]I don't even care.
[25:11.64]Can I change that shit?
[25:14.78]I forgot that game companies didn't realize how terrible it was until, like, 2006.
[25:18.78]What?
[25:29.67]Plane altitude?
[25:30.93]Reverse?
[25:31.53]Is this... Is this it?
[25:35.27]Nah, that's not it.
[25:49.70]No, it is for the plane.
[25:59.15]No, what I'd want is I'd want it inverted for the plane.
[26:06.63]Toy Commander!
[26:15.46]I thought I was going to break this disco and spring.
[26:18.46]And I think I might.
[26:24.91]It still wants me to put an egg in here.
[26:26.89]How am I going to do that?
[26:27.79]It's destroyed.
[26:33.91]I'm going to have to just reset the game.
[26:46.14]That's not gonna start a fire.
[26:51.12]I thought I was supposed to be using kid logic.
[26:52.98]Kids don't know how to use the stove.
[26:54.40]I do.
[27:07.22]Okay, it's on.
[27:14.30]Burn the fucking house down.
[27:15.48]I don't give a shit.
[27:20.74]So what was the point of giving me the tank in the first place?
[27:29.97]I thought I had to change to it.
[27:38.15]Is that just a different way to go?
[27:42.53]Alright, well, here's this one.
[27:43.28]It's called Rings of Fire.
[27:49.08]Okay.
[27:53.68]If you're a speedrunner, you go plane only.
[27:56.25]Okay, well, this is a race.
[27:57.57]You can just fly through the rings.
[27:59.37]Uh...
[28:09.56]Everything's fucking horseshit.
[28:12.50]Everything is horseshit.
[28:14.62]EVERYTHING IS HORSESHIT!
[28:16.31]Where the f- I gotta- Oh, this is a sip!
[28:23.85]Okay, who's increasing my speed?
[28:26.17]What's with the framerate?
[28:32.80]Where are- Where?
[28:34.22]Where are you even trying to tell me to go?
[28:37.56]What?
[28:41.66]Oh my god.
[28:47.56]This is horrible.
[29:04.55]Superman 64.
[29:11.51]I have to beat this one.
[29:12.77]Wait, I can kill the other competitors here?
[29:34.60]immediately what is it what I don't understand hold on it's it's right next it's the same ring
[30:05.93]I'm of the opinion that video games were terrible.
[30:09.77]But as children, we were forced to play them.
[30:12.56]Because it's the only thing we had in the house there.
[30:15.48]You couldn't just go and get a game on Steam.
[30:18.60]You couldn't go buy a game where you're gonna go to GameStop.
[30:21.56]Mom, you're gonna drive me to GameStop.
[30:22.81]No, there was no free to play Fortnite.
[30:25.37]There was no free to play TF2.
[30:28.27]If your mom got you a game at the grocery store, you had to play it.
[30:32.47]And you played it all fucking day.
[30:33.57]Because it was all you had.
[30:55.34]I wonder how many games that I actually... Because, like, I'm sitting here right now as an adult and going, like, man, this is horrible.
[31:01.44]This sucks.
[31:02.20]Why would I ever play this?
[31:04.07]If I got this as a kid, I would have 100%ed every single level.
[31:09.29]And I would have been like, this game's awesome.
[31:10.81]Because it's all my mom got me.
[31:13.22]This is all I... I can't get anything else.
[31:27.15]They didn't have video games when you were a kid?
[31:28.83]Yes, they did.
[31:29.21]It's because they also weren't jaded.
[31:35.51]Yeah, and like, there's been too many... Like, GTA 5 exists.
[31:41.36]You know what I mean?
[31:42.98]We're too spoiled as gamers.
[31:55.74]Okay, take down the enemy bombers.
[32:01.59]Regardless of what you think about GTA V, technically speaking, this is just flying around in the living room, shooting at Rad Movie 2 sets.
[32:22.64]I'm trying to think of a game that I played that was just painful, but it wasn't painful to me because I played it and I loved it.
[32:32.33]I'm trying to think of which game it would be.
[32:54.19]I'm about to scream like, Mom, go get me something else!
[33:06.35]I played Mario Golf at Anthony's.
[33:11.39]And I want it too!
[33:16.74]No, honey.
[33:18.02]You get Toy Commander.
[33:18.86]And you're gonna get 100% all those levels.
[33:23.49]Ooh, Mario Golf came out.
[33:31.03]Holy shit what a game that was.
[33:33.55]No one had ever played golf before on a computer.
[33:40.70]But they're all above.
[33:45.75]They do a bombing run- Are we on different teams?
[33:51.77]I keep dri- How do I keep missing this guy?
[34:00.30]I don't have any more left.
[34:08.03]No more missiles left.
[34:08.77]I have to do it in no fashion.
[34:21.69]Are the missiles just floating around somewhere?
[34:27.42]No, fuck it.
[34:43.93]Alright, that was quite a bit.
[34:50.92]This is your base.
[34:52.32]I know, but I can't... There.
[34:57.21]Okay, I Mario-golfed that guy.
[34:59.59]Hole-in-one.
[35:03.61]I'm just gonna sit here.
[35:17.83]I am using the radar.
[35:23.73]What's this have on IGN?
[35:24.80]Oh my god.
[35:31.22]Oh my god, it hurts.
[35:35.54]That was Toy Commander.
[35:36.53]I can't do the controls anymore.
[36:08.70]Let's move on to a good one.
[36:10.80]God, I'm gonna, nostalgia's gonna hit me in the face here and this is not even gonna be fun.
[36:14.52]Let's do Power Stone.
[36:28.65]We've been so, that was a nine on IGN.
[36:32.37]But it probably makes sense though, that was like so long ago.
[36:40.34]All jokes aside, this game is actually really, really awesome.
[36:48.35]Highly recommend.
[36:52.05]This is Power Stone.
[37:02.61]He's gonna Rage Quit this one.
[37:03.79]No!
[37:04.57]Did I Rage Quit Dynamite Cop?
[37:06.80]No, I beat it three times.
[37:09.37]I thought it was great.
[37:10.05]I thought it was a fun game, one of my favorites.
[37:12.01]I'm not gonna rage quit.
[37:13.07]Power Stone!
[37:13.49]Here it comes.
[37:14.35]Here it comes.
[37:14.85]Falcon.
[37:15.15]Lang.
[37:15.27]Ryoma.
[37:15.41]Gunrock.
[37:40.92]Captain Falcon.
[37:47.74]There's Power Stone 2 as well.
[37:53.30]Oh fuck, he didn't do it the way that I said.
[38:00.59]Still good.
[38:03.55]So, how the game works?
[38:06.49]It's a fighting game.
[38:08.01]Kind of.
[38:08.65]It's a fighting game.
[38:13.49]The whole point is there are Smash Balls.
[38:15.60]Where do you think they got that idea?
[38:20.82]So there are three Smash Balls that will show up.
[38:24.34]And what you gotta do is you gotta collect them.
[38:26.14]If you get three Smash Balls, three Power Stones, your character turns into the Power Stone version of their character.
[38:35.01]So I wonder, let's play as Jack.
[38:38.57]I don't really remember the controls or anything, but it's very fun.
[38:46.14]Jack versus Jack.
[38:51.00]Got his combos, got his Power Stone stuff.
[39:05.15]One, two, got them both, got them all.
[39:10.70]Here I am.
[39:21.45]Essentially, you have to avoid the guy with the smash ball.
[39:25.65]And I'm just hitting his ass right now.
[39:27.63]So it's two stones.
[39:29.07]Don't let him hit the other one.
[39:33.81]You knock him out.
[39:34.37]Oh, yeah, I knocked it out of him.
[39:35.37]I can, uh, where is it?
[39:36.43]This way?
[39:36.95]I need one more.
[39:42.47]What do you mean, pick a fight?
[39:48.61]I am the Green Jack.
[40:00.00]I'll take two of your stones.
[40:04.30]You gotta just bully in the very beginning and get three stones as soon as possible.
[40:13.03]And we jumped over it.
[40:18.89]Okay, that's alright.
[40:21.49]That's alright.
[40:21.97]That's okay.
[40:23.51]Uh-oh.
[40:25.11]Not okay.
[40:25.43]Where's the yellow one?
[40:26.91]Give me that.
[40:33.72]Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[40:34.70]Where'd it go?
[40:35.02]Where'd it go?
[40:35.44]Oh, here.
[40:36.90]Ah!
[40:37.22]Okay.
[40:43.38]Got him with a bomb.
[40:49.48]This game is so much fun.
[40:50.24]Let's just go ahead and beat the whole game first rank.
[40:59.73]In Lundo.
[41:01.67]LONDO.
[41:02.35]He's like kind of the Red Power Ranger.
[41:20.36]Uh oh, that's not good.
[41:34.04]Can't take this much damage.
[41:37.64]Got it.
[41:38.32]Got it, fuck.
[41:39.26]Gotta get a good hit.
[41:47.26]Got it.
[41:51.07]Got it.
[41:51.95]One more.
[41:53.03]Got it!
[41:54.21]One more!
[41:54.65]It's okay, we're good.
[41:56.47]He's not paying attention to any of the gems, which is a mistake.
[42:03.17]Uh-oh!
[42:05.40]No, no, no, no, no!
[42:06.46]He's gonna get blue, I'm gonna get yellow!
[42:08.34]Okay, he's off screen.
[42:09.78]Holy shit, he just tailed me.
[42:19.79]I know there's like a clock, or a dog, or something, I think, from what I remember.
[42:28.24]Or like a reverser.
[42:31.68]I know there is.
[42:47.23]You lost the other gem, didn't you?
[42:51.34]Take it.
[42:51.68]Go.
[43:10.59]Oh man, he's smart.
[43:12.13]I'm getting kind of beat here.
[43:15.41]Oh, that was bad.
[43:17.43]I need to go and, like, practice and learn to, uh, block some stuff.
[43:22.92]Is this a grab, too?
[43:25.20]Is this a punch or kick?
[43:27.86]Is this a dash, too?
[43:38.63]Are you smarter than a Dreamcast?
[43:40.27]Goddammit.
[43:40.94]Give me that hue.
[43:41.96]No, just get the stones.
[43:43.00]Just get the stones.
[44:02.12]Is that a sword?
[44:05.10]I'll take it.
[44:06.12]I'll take it.
[44:07.18]See, there it is, there's the dog.
[44:13.13]How do you do that?
[44:29.47]There's that, like, dash.
[44:30.69]I don't even know how you do that move.
[44:32.01]Is it left trigger?
[44:34.41]Fuck, I'm in trouble.
[44:37.99]I don't know what block is!
[44:41.19]I'm dead.
[45:13.07]Got it!
[45:25.88]Holy shit, if he kills me in Power Stone form, it'll be so embarrassing!
[45:33.12]Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the five community subs.
[45:39.72]Play with Etalyx?
[45:40.58]I don't have another controller.
[45:42.52]I don't have two Dreamcast controllers, unfortunately.
[45:54.11]Go back to Toy Commander?
[46:00.82]Why would you want me to do that?
[46:01.96]Hold on.
[46:03.50]Is it okay?
[46:04.10]Button config.
[46:04.84]Here we go.
[46:05.42]Alright.
[46:05.78]Jump.
[46:06.54]Grab.
[46:07.10]Punch.
[46:08.95]So what's a dash?
[46:11.63]Power fusion one, power fusion two.
[46:14.85]Yeah, you get a special move.
[46:17.29]Two of them.
[46:18.61]Maybe you saw Falcon do it, but then you lose your power stone.
[46:22.41]So let's grab.
[46:28.45]I'm trying to figure out if I can dash with that maybe.
[46:32.71]Smells good.
[46:34.13]Dammit, she got it.
[46:40.50]No, what's that?
[46:42.24]Sorry, I only get hit by one thing.
[46:54.05]Ooh, a direct hit right in her head.
[46:55.46]I think this is where it went.
[47:01.70]Yeah, let me try those one of the Fuse Meals.
[47:14.03]Oh, I suck at it.
[47:14.65]That's awesome.
[47:15.51]So I get in close and do the Cyclone.
[47:19.69]Good.
[47:23.10]Got it.
[47:23.46]That's what they're jumping.
[47:30.52]Can blow!
[47:36.16]Didn't get her.
[47:45.59]This game is cool.
[47:49.60]This game is very cool.
[48:16.76]Fine, you wanna play that game?
[48:22.37]Let's get you right at the- right at the wake-up!
[48:26.91]I'm getting all freedom again.
[48:31.29]Okay, she's just dazed!
[48:35.83]Get it!
[48:41.67]Thank you, very cool!
[48:42.65]What's the other, uh, special move?
[48:48.69]The jump above you, you do right trigger, and that's the other special.
[48:57.51]I also can't understand why Capcom has not made a new one of these.
[49:03.21]They only came out for Dreamcast, they were only available for Dreamcast 1 and 2, that's it.
[49:17.31]It's such a cool franchise that even it's a very simple concept, they could turn it into something so much bigger.
[49:24.38]With the popularity of the games like Smash right now, you wouldn't want to have like your own kind of version of this.
[49:30.00]Shit.
[49:30.12]Maybe your other one.
[49:31.98]What the hell is he doing?
[49:53.90]That's not a good place to be, especially right now.
[49:56.86]Into the meat grinder.
[49:57.92]Oh, he's a fan.
[50:00.41]I got it.
[50:01.15]Shit, crap.
[50:21.92]There's a lot of dynamic with who has one, who has two.
[50:25.86]It's really fun just to try to dance around the fact that even when you have three, this could be a waste of time.
[50:35.97]There's a lot of people that played this game that didn't even give a shit about the jump.
[50:39.19]They just went for the kill, that's it.
[50:40.57]Because it was too much of a distraction.
[50:44.37]So, oh, what randomly spawned?
[50:46.39]They just fought.
[50:59.20]Oh, no, no, no, let me just, let me, let me two-stalk him, come on!
[51:03.90]He's gonna get all free, he is.
[51:07.55]He turns into the Thing.
[51:08.55]Fuck.
[51:13.27]That kinda sucked, I'm not gonna lie.
[51:18.11]Alright, time to thank you.
[51:32.73]I'm not gonna get it.
[51:36.69]Dominoes of Pizza Hut, Pizza Hut.
[51:44.13]I'll tell you, first try I'm gonna get to the end.
[51:49.45]Or lose.
[51:53.08]Did you say wrong?
[51:55.30]Pizza Hut has stuffed crust.
[52:02.82]I don't really like to order either of them.
[52:04.32]I like local places.
[52:05.68]I like local places.
[52:08.80]But if I'm gonna order Pizza Hut original donuts, I'm gonna get the stuffed crust.
[52:16.62]Alright, they're all three around.
[52:20.04]One, two, three, all in the same corner.
[52:22.90]Every Pizza Hut smells like a bowling alley.
[52:32.36]No, it doesn't.
[52:34.46]All pizza places smell like a bowling alley.
[52:38.58]Every Pizza Hut is NEXT to a bowling alley.
[52:50.51]I mean, I'm not gonna argue with that.
[53:02.47]Did I finish your trigger?
[53:05.70]Oops-a-daisy.
[53:10.98]Bowling alley is usually served with pizza, yeah.
[53:12.91]What's the matter with the bowling alley?
[53:18.11]You don't like going to the ball?
[53:20.61]And I find it when I can see.
[53:26.59]You know what?
[53:26.91]Okay, I'm gonna give you guys a little bit of a how-the-hell-is-it-possible scenario.
[53:31.52]So, bowling is like an old, like, boomer thing to do.
[53:36.16]That's what a lot of you would say, right?
[53:39.16]So, how did bowling alleys survive and not arcades?
[53:43.90]Bowling alleys are, like, kind of old and old school and... A lot of the arcades don't go away.
[53:51.58]It's the same thing.
[53:53.92]A lot of arcades have closed down, they've kind of...
[54:00.62]Stuffed into the Dave & Buster style.
[54:03.48]But actual... Think about bowling alleys.
[54:07.47]What the fuck is a corporate bowling alley?
[54:09.85]They don't exist.
[54:12.35]It's like Bob's Bowling Alley.
[54:16.75]Or The Lane.
[54:18.29]And it's one guy owned it.
[54:20.05]It's not like a corporation.
[54:21.13]There's no big bowling company.
[54:29.42]So the Dave and Buster's argument, like, doesn't work there.
[54:33.60]How did they get to stay in business?
[54:35.03]And arcades didn't.
[54:37.07]Mom and pop arcades, I mean.
[54:49.31]I guess that their overhead really is not that much, maybe.
[54:52.61]How much does it cost to run a bowling alley?
[54:56.48]I mean, you've probably had the same ball as the same pins for a long time.
[55:02.53]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[55:06.99]I'm at the final second of the whole line.
[55:08.81]Alright, I'm getting dumped on here.
[55:13.68]I'm getting dumped on.
[55:14.44]I'm not gonna get perfect.
[55:25.77]Thought I'd been hit one fucking time.
[55:27.77]Ah, right.
[55:27.99]Sorry.
[55:28.13]Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
[55:52.01]Alright, don't even let the wake-up happen.
[55:53.23]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[55:53.89]Don't let the wake-up happen.
[55:55.07]She's getting bolted stones.
[56:02.45]Mmm, greedy.
[56:03.39]Went for the stones.
[56:06.47]Uh-oh.
[56:10.54]Uh-oh.
[56:12.20]Direct hit!
[56:14.12]No!
[56:15.12]Get her with the bomb!
[56:18.68]Do it!
[56:21.52]You didn't even see!
[56:31.46]Really?
[56:32.42]He's got baited so hard.
[56:33.56]Why'd I even shoot him?
[56:39.24]Got him.
[56:42.04]Knocked them both.
[56:42.98]Gimme, gimme, gimme!
[56:48.05]Shit!
[56:49.89]God damn it, this is bad.
[57:01.08]Oh, my sweaty hand!
[57:03.24]Uh-oh!
[57:18.73]Give me that.
[57:24.48]No, no, no, no, no!
[57:27.74]Where'd it go?
[57:36.62]What just hit me?
[57:37.18]What?
[57:38.50]What hit me?
[58:00.22]Alright, we're at the final battle with the Captain Hook flapjack character, Criken.
[58:22.23]I mean, let me first try Power Stone after, like, 15 years of not playing it.
[58:26.20]Come on.
[58:27.18]I'm ready.
[58:52.23]No!
[58:52.75]The environment!
[58:54.15]Got it.
[59:08.12]He's just trying to get the gems.
[59:15.29]He's just a gem hoarder.
[59:19.83]Last one!
[59:22.64]Got it, twice in a row.
[59:24.38]Got it.
[59:27.70]Environment, get him with the environment.
[59:32.06]See you later.
[59:35.34]One more time.
[59:36.52]Shit, he has a good gun.
[59:53.36]Ooh, he got greedy and it was downfall!
[59:55.60]Alright, fuck it.
[60:08.07]No, shit!
[60:09.11]I got too greedy with the... I can still do it?
[60:11.25]No, I can't.
[60:11.73]I'm in trouble.
[60:18.80]No, don't let...
[60:34.03]Where'd he go?
[60:36.76]Oh, he's holding on.
[60:38.86]Okay, I see.
[61:02.10]Alright, I gotta get it one more time.
[61:08.22]FUCK!
[61:32.00]Did I win?
[61:36.42]Fuck, shit, no!
[61:37.70]Oh, the timer!
[61:38.75]Oh, I had it.
[61:40.71]Come on, let's go.
[61:51.58]That was horrible placement.
[61:55.96]Did you see that bullshit?
[61:57.32]That was bullshit.
[61:58.00]That was un-fucking-believable.
[62:00.02]I just got screwed.
[62:12.95]Oh no!
[62:26.42]Really?
[62:28.98]That was so salty.
[62:29.89]That was such bullshit.
[62:31.11]I knocked him into all three of them.
[62:34.75]That was such- I'm fucking absolutely mad about that.
[62:42.98]I literally knocked all the gems out of him and he fell down into all of them.
[62:46.90]That was stupid.
[63:00.96]I had it too.
[63:02.10]I was gonna do a first try.
[63:04.18]Oh well.
[63:05.22]Did he just catch me in the ear?
[63:30.06]He's doing this little cheat move where he just... All this guy cares about is the Smash Ball.
[63:45.04]So we don't even care about the Smash Ball.
[63:46.42]Just beat him.
[64:03.24]I should have had it that first try.
[64:05.14]Those of you Power Stone vets will know what I'm talking about.
[64:12.13]There we go.
[64:30.77]Oh, he was.
[64:31.43]He wasn't focused on it.
[64:33.55]Gee, look, he cares so much about this.
[64:41.86]Should've just bought him like this the whole time.
[65:06.69]Move out of my way!
[65:14.96]You greedy asshole!
[65:18.55]Your character bottle's too big!
[65:19.83]Oh god...
[65:37.86]Oh my god, he's gonna do it again!
[65:41.26]No, why?
[65:42.38]What the fuck?
[65:43.64]That's so stupid!
[65:46.32]It wasn't his inti- ugh.
[65:47.92]I'm gonna die.
[65:54.34]He just- just fucking- oh my god, I'm so angry.
[65:59.28]Victory!
[65:59.70]We're no pirates!
[66:01.50]Are you ready?
[66:03.93]Action!
[66:06.50]The dude just dropkicks you once.
[66:08.00]He has a move... He has a move where if he touches you with it once, he just... It's like a... And it knocks out your stun.
[66:14.41]This guy's too hard.
[66:16.49]I need this again and again.
[66:24.62]Thankfully, this move sucks.
[66:28.58]Oh my god, I just got too mad.
[66:36.68]I'm so tilted from that first fucking try.
[66:42.18]Stupid fucking asshole pirate.
[66:45.62]His body, he's got like a fucking square of a hitbox that he can just push into you.
[66:50.98]That move right there.
[66:53.28]It is a half second frame per move.
[67:19.63]What?
[67:19.87]What?
[67:20.49]Why?
[67:22.22]Why?
[67:22.48]What?
[67:22.78]It's because he's doing that move.
[67:25.58]Ugh.
[67:29.34]I'm trying to fuck off.
[67:51.73]Cannon just hit me.
[67:55.77]He's gonna... I can't just keep patching from Spongebob.
[68:08.21]I beat everyone in the game on the first try, and you see like his cheap shit move that he has.
[68:22.24]UNFUCKING BELIEVABLE
[68:52.98]Are you ready?
[68:54.00]Action!
[68:54.34]Go, go, go!
[69:22.22]Come on!
[70:00.09]Get over here!
[70:04.32]No, fuck off.
[70:04.90]Just die.
[70:26.47]Campe Mambo!
[71:05.68]Fuck this.
[71:06.10]No, fuck, just use it.
[71:11.32]Bomb!
[71:11.96]I win.
[71:12.44]I win!
[71:13.30]I win!
[71:31.06]Eat shit!
[71:32.00]Fuck that pirate guy.
[71:43.46]Hope your boat flips over in Flapjack.
[71:51.24]Oh, that's not even the last boss I forgot.
[71:54.06]Oh, right!
[71:55.34]It's this guy!
[71:56.52]Alright, let's go.
[72:05.66]Oops.
[72:06.06]Oh, he does so much damage.
[72:38.96]Damn it, I didn't get him!
[72:42.52]God damn it, holy shit, he's insane.
[72:49.88]He does like two and a half bars of hit.
[73:09.06]This is bad.
[73:14.50]I don't know what the hell he does.
[73:39.03]Come on.
[74:06.78]Bad placement!
[74:10.69]Bad placement!
[74:11.65]That move!
[74:12.67]Oh my god!
[74:13.65]Give it here, give it here, give it here!
[74:20.76]Give me that!
[74:52.09]let's go faster than real man
[75:21.58]I don't know how that happened.
[75:22.85]What the fuck was that horseshit?
[75:24.21]What the hell was that?
[75:27.03]Like, like... What happened?
[75:28.91]Did I hit the bomb?
[75:30.11]Bullshit!
[76:03.67]Damn it!
[76:04.91]I had to... What the hell was that bounce off the wall?!
[76:09.12]That bounce off the wall!
[76:10.12]The gem went right... It sucked into his body!
[76:12.54]Like a fucking vacuum!
[76:16.24]Give me the third one!
[76:18.63]Right now!
[76:19.13]Over here!
[76:19.65]Give me a good spawn!
[76:44.73]Get the fuck out of here.
[76:45.51]Come on, one more.
[76:47.39]Got it.
[77:22.46]This is it!
[77:22.92]This is it!
[77:23.68]This is it!
[77:47.22]That bomb!
[77:47.86]What's going on with this zombie?
[77:51.30]I win.
[78:15.05]Just tap him.
[78:16.67]Just tap him.
[78:19.65]Don't fucking throw it.
[78:24.00]I can't- I just got, like, comboed!
[78:27.50]No way!
[78:29.16]Impossible!
[78:35.43]I- I can't believe it!
[78:37.47]I can't believe- I got six!
[78:38.59]What?! !
[78:47.42]Fuck you.
[78:47.92]You wanna get flawless, dickhead?
[78:50.76]Is that what you wanna have happen?
[79:18.55]You wanna get flawlessed?
[79:20.21]After that bullshit?
[79:44.36]Oh my fucking god, I can't believe it.
[79:47.42]I can't fucking believe it.
[79:51.05]I had one hit.
[79:52.91]Oh my god, what horse shit?
[79:54.21]That's such dog shit.
[79:56.09]Dude, literally took me six health.
[80:00.23]Oh, I am.
[80:00.89]This is the maddest I've ever been at a video game in my entire life, I think.
[80:07.43]That's un-fucking-believable.
[80:12.33]He did almost six full health bars in like two different- I'm so mad.
[80:17.01]That's unbelievable.
[80:17.57]That is so fucking ridiculous.
[80:29.43]Just kill me.
[80:30.87]Do two moves and kill me, Final Boss.
[80:37.55]I got sloppy.
[80:38.53]I didn't get sloppy.
[80:39.31]I got unlucky.
[80:41.45]Because I did my move, and you have two or three seconds after your move is done for him to go do a bunch of fucking... set up a bunch of mouse traps for me.
[80:51.06]Oh, God.
[80:54.54]Yes.
[80:58.72]In addition to the Abolition War.
[81:03.21]Wanna get flawless, yeah.
[81:04.79]But don't worry, he just had to do two moves to do four.
[81:07.65]Oh, I hate that.
[81:08.59]Dude, I understand, like, you give a final boss and you make him stronger and shit, but, like, does he have to be, like, three or four times stronger?
[81:18.69]You know what I mean?
[81:20.41]Why?
[81:22.11]Does he have to do, like, four times your damage?
[81:24.29]What the hell is that?
[81:25.61]Who made up that?
[81:29.09]Just kill me again, please.
[81:37.64]No, it's very doable.
[81:43.29]I'm just hyper-tilted right now.
[81:45.37]It's like, you gotta beat the last boss three times.
[81:53.71]He's got, like, why even have the health bars here?
[81:56.15]Why don't you give him, like, five more health bars?
[82:06.98]Alright, this is the one.
[82:09.90]This is the one.
[82:10.52]Let me beat the boss three times in a row.
[82:13.28]And then win.
[82:37.19]Why did I do that?
[82:39.25]Just kill me again.
[82:40.68]God damn it.
[82:43.54]Just kill me.
[83:05.14]I grabbed him, but something took priority over an attack.
[83:08.36]Oh well.
[83:08.78]I'll try one more with Stalker.
[83:39.97]It's so fucking fast.
[83:43.65]It's not fucking there!
[83:47.28]Look at him!
[83:48.62]Okay.
[83:48.80]Look at the bars.
[83:50.60]Look at the top left bars.
[83:54.06]He landed on his stomach and took 60% of my health pool.
[84:13.49]I should be embarrassed.
[84:14.68]Because this motherfucker was dead almost twice in a row.
[84:52.43]And he's gonna get it, because they spawned right in front of him.
[85:04.03]That's un-fucking-believable.
[85:27.62]Are you ready?
[85:35.14]Action!
[85:35.62]Death!
[85:36.10]Death!
[85:56.69]What the fuck was that?
[86:27.81]No, no.
[86:28.25]I gotta go back to the character I've played before.
[86:33.17]And try.
[86:55.68]Let's do the roll.
[87:38.86]Now I have to beat this.
[87:40.14]This game is really good.
[87:41.42]I'm just salty at the last unfair boss.
[87:45.21]This is like the Shao Kahn.
[87:54.60]Let me rephrase that.
[87:58.97]This is Mortal Kombat 1, shall we?
[88:22.17]How did you... You're gonna jump over... Give me a fucking break.
[88:27.72]You're gonna jump over a goddamn fire?
[88:36.36]What... What's the priority?
[88:37.75]Why did you get priority there?
[88:38.89]Oh my god.
[88:42.49]We both just...
[88:58.00]Oh my fucking goodness.
[89:08.65]Christ.
[89:09.65]Victory!
[89:10.67]Charge!
[89:11.07]Two.
[89:11.55]Are you ready?
[89:13.21]Action!
[89:13.47]Go!
[89:13.77]Go!
[89:13.99]Go!
[89:32.54]How much does that do?
[89:34.50]Not very much.
[89:37.97]Get me the... He's gonna get it now.
[89:45.27]Fucking god, Jared, get out of here!
[90:04.81]What the fuck was that?
[90:35.43]Yeah, another thing that somebody just said is true.
[90:39.67]Forget about, like, the awful gem spawn.
[90:51.51]is like dodging and blocking or something.
[90:54.43]I don't even know how to do it.
[90:56.57]Can I?
[90:58.04]Is it even... I don't remember it being in the game.
[91:01.82]What's like the dodge?
[91:03.50]How do you do it?
[91:04.66]Is it possible?
[91:05.76]In a certain button combination?
[91:09.28]Oh!
[91:16.22]Because that's... Sometimes you can reverse him.
[91:19.62]I'm just trying to see how to get it to work.
[91:27.86]I don't think it exists.
[91:33.33]You have to jump or press a direction at perfect timing.
[91:45.11]Okay.
[91:47.02]Uh, am I getting baited here?
[91:48.78]I think I'm getting baited.
[91:51.04]Nah, I just got baited.
[92:13.83]I'm not timing it right, but... I'm pretty sure I'm just getting fucked in here.
[92:28.28]When you get hit... You lose it.
[92:47.18]He just blocked it.
[93:04.91]No, I'm not gonna rage at Tony Hawk.
[93:06.83]Tony Hawk doesn't have a boss that has x10 health and x10 damage.
[93:11.39]It's a skateboarder.
[93:12.03]I think he does it just faster.
[93:15.82]I'm trying to get it.
[93:50.48]It's so fucking sad to me because I had it so close and then I just got bodied over and over again.
[93:57.79]I would have moved on to Tony Hawk by now.
[94:13.50]See, he's doing it.
[94:15.96]He's just so perfect.
[94:17.40]We're talking about, like, difficulty spikes, right?
[94:24.84]The ENTIRE game was a breeze.
[94:27.89]Until the last two bosses.
[94:29.31]Like, what the fuck?
[94:31.09]When did this game come out?
[94:32.65]2025?
[94:32.73]Okay, I'm gonna, like, just hunker down and try again.
[94:43.52]I'm just progressively getting worse because I'm just exhausted trying to beat this fucking guy.
[94:49.30]Alright, here we go.
[95:13.70]Oh, no!
[95:14.47]Oh, no!
[95:56.86]This is it!
[96:25.30]Are you ready?
[96:26.20]Let's go!
[97:03.45]Dude, he's like gluing to these items!
[97:30.12]No, what did I do that for?
[97:31.66]Shut up, Jeremy!
[97:32.44]Just beat him!
[97:33.14]Ah, no!
[97:59.37]What?
[97:59.71]What?
[97:59.97]What?
[98:00.37]What?
[98:01.21]What?
[98:01.99]When did I lose the other one?
[98:03.21]What the fuck, man?
[98:04.89]What?
[98:07.01]You guys are kidding me.
[98:10.25]You have to be kidding me.
[98:17.91]There's no way.
[98:20.41]That was... I don't care who you are, everybody knows it was stupid.
[98:23.87]It was.
[98:25.67]It just was.
[98:27.23]Alright, I'm not going in the air ever again.
[98:32.72]I'm literally never gonna jump in the air.
[98:33.88]Not one time, never.
[98:34.92]This is un-fucking-bearable.
[98:37.60]Why am I doing this to myself?
[99:12.58]No you don't!
[99:44.82]No, don't!
[99:45.18]Come on!
[100:11.96]Oh my fucking god.
[100:42.15]He dodged a bullet in behind him.
[101:13.39]Got some fucking RNG there, didn't I?
[101:42.07]Oh, god damn it!
[102:15.26]Somebody did mention, he is like perfect dodging almost every one of my attacks.
[102:21.98]Fuck me man, it was so close.
[102:42.67]I mean, it's one thing to learn how to properly dodge every attack, but he's dodging almost every one!
[103:01.97]He's getting so many of these rolls where they just appear behind him, right next to him, on top of him.
[103:08.31]It's like, come on!
[103:13.12]And it takes so much to kill him!
[103:14.84]I might as well just restart, try to get it.
[103:23.98]Starting over.
[103:30.67]I gotta dodge that at least.
[103:32.53]I keep getting caught by that every time.
[103:37.19]I'm lucky to get, like, not even one bar.
[104:12.78]Yeah!
[104:13.50]Alright!
[104:14.32]Let's go!
[104:39.27]Oh my god!
[104:42.35]Jesus, come on!
[104:47.31]I'm just trying to get away from him, and he's just... He also has perfect sight of the gems when you're limited to what the game shows you.
[104:57.28]Okay, I'm gonna try a different character.
[105:01.18]Maybe it's time to throw on this guy.
[105:03.58]I don't even know.
[105:09.05]I'm here.
[105:10.03]I have to beat it.
[105:11.17]I thought I could catch him with the dodge there.
[105:37.66]I'm Lord in Heaven.
[105:38.46]Looks like this guy can dodge.
[106:16.83]Flamethrower is honestly the best thing to ever use.
[106:27.45]It's going to hit him.
[106:29.09]Just only run around until you get a flamethrower.
[106:39.42]Exhibit A. There it is.
[106:40.90]I will cheese the fuck out of this guy.
[106:46.46]Do you think I care?
[106:47.24]Let's go.
[107:10.12]I didn't even know I've got a lot of people.
[107:14.72]No, he got the gun before I did!
[107:17.58]Oh no!
[107:20.20]He's too focused on it.
[107:22.14]Oh my god!
[107:41.06]Fuck off.
[107:41.54]I don't know if I have enough health to do it.
[107:52.47]I think it's gonna be perfect.
[108:23.89]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[108:25.89]It, like, bounced, and he was gonna get it regardless.
[108:28.37]Oh my god, it's such bullshit.
[108:30.33]It really is.
[108:54.46]What happened?
[108:56.88]What the fuck was that?
[109:23.13]Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me, man.
[109:28.70]That's... This is so stupid.
[109:30.08]That actually is dumb.
[109:30.92]Like, really dumb.
[109:44.47]Here we go.
[109:45.48]Here we go.
[110:19.50]Just live!
[110:20.62]Live!
[110:21.06]Three!
[110:22.44]Two!
[110:23.76]One!
[110:24.90]Don't do it!
[110:26.95]That's it!
[110:28.33]What?! !
[110:46.60]Last challenge, one.
[110:48.58]Are you ready?
[110:49.62]Action!
[110:49.98]Death!
[110:51.64]Death!
[110:53.87]Death!
[110:55.23]Death!
[111:26.06]I love how I got the Power Stone, but he did more damage than I did.
[111:29.09]Even during the fucking Power Stone.
[111:30.97]Fuck you.
[111:48.19]But like, I can't move during that.
[111:49.83]He gets a free hit every fucking time.
[112:16.29]That's it!
[112:16.97]That's it!
[112:44.59]Come on, come on!
[113:20.17]See what I'm talking about?
[113:20.97]He gets a free fucking hit.
[113:22.56]I freaked out.
[113:23.52]It's okay.
[113:46.64]Don't spawn over there.
[113:48.28]What have you got?
[114:03.66]No fucking stupid idiot.
[114:05.47]Why would you even pick up an item for no reason?
[114:07.75]He's so much faster than you.
[114:09.15]There's no reason to do what I just did.
[114:11.17]Like, unbelievable.
[114:14.43]I thought it was like a gun or something.
[114:16.11]He is so unbearably difficult.
[114:18.70]Like, why would you just... I'm gonna make him...
[114:36.29]Oh my fucking god, I hate this.
[115:07.86]I can't fucking believe it, man.
[115:09.67]I just... I still got him.
[115:21.03]My hands are like literally sweating.
[115:25.58]Where's the other one?
[115:37.02]Oh, no.
[116:05.23]I did it.
[116:05.65]I had to have won.
[116:06.53]I had to have won.
[116:11.83]I did it!
[116:12.21]I win.
[116:12.61]I win the game.
[116:13.11]I'm done.
[116:16.11]Oh.
[116:16.47]Um...
[116:42.30]I don't know what?
[116:45.69]What?
[116:47.95]What the fuck was that?
[116:49.51]I couldn't even do anything.
[116:53.66]What?
[117:11.09]Give me the stone!
[117:23.18]It's very, okay, it's very possible.
[117:37.64]Oh my god!
[117:42.11]GIVE IT TO ME!
[117:52.36]Do I get to do this again?
[117:55.58]I have to.
[117:59.55]This is not even as bad.
[118:00.59]This is like the jokey end of the game.
[118:01.99]I mean, it's horrible.
[118:04.47]Yeah, thank god.
[118:05.01]Alright, let's go.
[118:06.90]Let me beat Akira.
[118:08.94]There's no dodge in that, you just have to take a full, painful hit.
[118:14.69]I'm trying to dodge these.
[118:19.93]I'm not even sure if I can.
[118:39.40]Dodge roll?
[118:39.92]I don't know if it's possible, because it's not technically an attack.
[118:43.69]It's kind of just a big thing that attacks you when it falls on you.
[118:54.53]Try jumping over them?
[118:55.31]You lose speed when you jump.
[118:58.87]That's the last one.
[119:01.83]I'm not gonna do it right now.
[119:02.98]Is it on top of him?
[119:15.27]Don't go behind him?
[119:18.36]He wasn't... There was only behind him.
[119:23.86]Final challenge!
[119:26.24]Are you ready?
[119:29.26]Action!
[119:53.78]Watch out!
[119:55.20]Shit, I'm behind him, I'm behind him, I'm looking for my- Oh my god, that's undodgeable.
[120:05.82]Just never be... Actually, he does it no matter what.
[120:21.17]I think it's just random number generation.
[120:58.63]Thanks for the frame rate.
[121:17.44]OH!
[121:17.84]GOD DAMMIT!
[121:19.18]How much health do I have?
[121:23.62]NOOO!
[121:24.44]GOD!
[121:24.94]Oh god, the fucking timer!
[121:28.99]Oh, man!
[121:29.89]I just... Just spent... That's what I thought, and it was a bad idea.
[121:41.65]I'll get it.
[121:42.15]I mean, this is... This is... I hate everything about this, but I'm gonna beat it.
[121:58.04]Does he have like a... another move that's like a... Not really.
[122:05.09]I think I'm actually really just gonna use it like this, and then run.
[122:09.41]If I collect the stones.
[122:11.48]I'm not even sure how I pick up the stones.
[122:21.51]That was a different show
[122:51.67]Another rifle.
[122:52.23]Come on.
[122:53.35]I'll take it.
[122:54.04]Sword!
[122:54.56]End it with a sword.
[123:05.83]Game over.
[123:11.05]Oh, that was hell.
[123:23.89]For the Chaos Emerald.
[123:25.01]He doesn't need it.
[123:25.71]He shatters it.
[123:26.93]Worst ending.
[123:27.35]Ha!
[123:51.14]Yeah, that was like the world's going Was the ending worth it?
[124:02.89]I had to do it because internally if I stopped At that last boss I would have been so unfulfilled
[124:23.89]My reputation would have been ruined.
[124:31.65]Mrs. Space, thanks for 10 community subs.
[124:34.23]Thank you so much, Mrs. Space.
[124:39.94]10 community subs.
[124:42.12]Okay.
[124:45.54]There's the Infinity Gauntlet.
[124:53.33]The end?
[124:53.75]Please wait.
[124:56.65]A new feature has been added.
[124:57.71]Would you like to save now?
[124:58.89]Yes.
[124:59.81]Sure.
[125:02.92]Do all endings?
[125:04.00]I don't think I can handle it.
[125:06.20]What's the new feature?
[125:11.96]Extra options?
[125:12.72]Game options.
[125:17.03]Wow, you know I can I can set how many power stones you have to get extra items damage recovery I Can fuck around with these Game options we are liking right.
[125:33.25]I don't There's no way I'm gonna make it anything hard in this turn off the time limit
[125:45.48]Beat the game on easy.
[125:48.12]No.
[125:56.51]What else is there?
[125:57.09]Anything else?
[125:59.19]I just want to see something.
[126:03.01]So, how do you unlock it?
[126:10.28]Do I not unlock it?
[126:11.56]How do I unlock the other character?
[126:15.62]Next?
[126:15.86]Now, hold on, wait, hold on, I know, I'm not gonna do the whole thing.
[126:22.65]I have to beat the game with every character to unlock it.
[126:24.65]You have to beat the game without using continues, that's not even a joke.
[126:31.81]Holy shit.
[126:32.39]You have to look under the drop line.
[126:47.99]This game is really, really fun though, especially when you play with more than one person.
[126:53.39]Which one are you?
[126:54.29]Uh, I'm the one that's currently getting... Yeah.
[126:59.46]I mean, it's just that last boss.
[127:07.70]It's just... It's just like, come on.
[127:10.97]What the hell was that nonsense?
[127:16.60]times three damage times five dodge times five health like it's just it's just accurate I don't have a skin default skin but it is very good forget about my final boss complaints
[127:43.61]This is Final Smash, the video game, essentially.
[127:47.35]It's very, very good.
[127:51.19]Did I say the game sucks at all?
[127:52.25]I don't think it is.
[127:53.81]When I was, like, in the middle of that meltdown where I was getting destroyed by the black ball.
[127:58.05]I didn't say the game sucks, did I?
[127:59.04]Well, that move is amazing.
[128:11.00]Did I beat the boss?
[128:11.84]I did.
[128:12.54]I beat the two bosses.
[128:15.21]I did.
[128:18.93]Okay, good, good.
[128:19.61]Because I don't believe that.
[128:21.67]Whatever my frustrated mind would say, I don't believe that.
[128:25.15]I think this is actually very good.
[128:29.82]But...
[128:38.28]I beat Valgus, but Flogin Brothers is too hard.
[128:41.26]Alright, well we got to... I played... This is kind of what I figured was going to happen.
[128:49.73]I was going to play something like Power Stone for a couple of hours.
[128:52.07]But let's keep going.
[128:56.05]So we're going to move on from here.
[129:09.20]I have Tony Hawk.
[129:10.86]I also have a survival horror game called Carrier.
[129:21.29]Because if I put in Tony Hawk, I'm going to play Tony Hawk for the rest of the night.
[129:32.97]So we got to get some of these other ones out of the way.
[129:38.11]So just give me one second.
[129:43.35]Okay, I just opened the case and the glass shattered.
[129:47.94]Like three chunks of glass just like shot up over here.
[129:53.24]I didn't, I just opened it.
[129:54.28]I just opened the glass.
[129:55.48]I opened the case.
[129:56.20]I gotta be careful.
[130:01.18]I gotta pick this shit up.
[130:02.04]Hold on.
[130:02.36]Cause that will be bad.
[130:04.88]It's like sharp.
[130:07.29]It's not glass.
[130:07.95]It's that like super sharp plastic bullshit.
[130:14.21]Sonic Adventure is on PC, so I'm going to do those at a different date.
[130:22.44]Games I'm doing today are the games that are not available anywhere else, only on Dreamcast, the actual console.
[130:29.37]They weren't ported, etc.
[130:38.23]I have all of them.
[130:38.87]Shenmue is another one.
[130:39.97]Shenmue, I had an option to get it on Dreamcast.
[130:43.87]But not even last year, they ported the game to PC and they upscaled it to like 1080, right?
[130:54.10]Tony Hawk is on PC.
[130:55.06]Tony Hawk 2 is not on PC.
[130:57.96]They did like a remaster of Tony Hawk 1 and it was kind of lukewarm.
[131:03.33]Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 is not on PC.
[131:06.53]It's only on the consoles.
[131:08.96]What do you mean, yes it is?
[131:14.74]Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 is on PC.
[131:18.82]What?
[131:30.99]Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 PC.
[131:38.81]Oh, but it's an old Windows game.
[131:42.49]And you know how hellish it can be sometimes to get those to run.
[131:45.55]I guess it is on PC.
[131:50.45]Does it actually work on Windows 10?
[131:51.89]Alright, here's Carrier.
[132:04.26]It doesn't work on Windows 10.
[132:11.98]Just get a virtual box.
[132:13.06]Yeah, but I mean, if I already have a Dreamcast here... Do I really want to make, like, a virtual emulation machine to play Team Up 2?
[132:21.06]When I already have it here, and this is arguably the best version as the one on Dreamcast?
[132:29.11]Why is there somebody's... Somebody has their website in the corner.
[132:37.23]Why?
[132:38.15]Why did they shoot us down?
[132:43.24]Leonard, Lieutenant Manning.
[132:45.38]Am I the only one that made it?
[132:48.99]Is that... Leonard?
[132:56.15]So the opening, I didn't press start yet though.
[132:58.25]That's like the demo screen.
[133:09.29]Everybody did.
[133:09.85]The Resident Evil, when you press start, it says the name.
[133:16.05]Whatever, let's just go.
[133:26.28]By the beginning of the 21st century, the North-South conflict had escalated to military confrontation.
[133:32.34]Which North-South?
[133:33.10]The people of the countries of the South, faced with an energy crisis and a food shortage, had developed a deep-seated hatred for the North.
[133:40.13]Is this just generic country names?
[133:41.27]And as a result, anti-North terrorist groups began to show up all over the world.
[133:46.37]In response, the countries of the North joined together to create the Northern Hemisphere Treaty Alliance, NTA.
[133:52.71]Earth?
[133:53.63]The goal of this organization was to stop the Southern terrorists.
[133:58.80]In 2023, the NTA completed construction of the Heimdall aircraft carrier.
[134:04.50]With its staged defense system and connection to the satellite defense system, the Heimdall is like a steel wall, invulnerable to any sort of air-based attack.
[134:14.25]The first mission for the Heimdall was to attack the base of the Southern Cross terrorist group.
[134:19.85]This was called the Hurricane Mission.
[134:22.39]during an attack that lasted only a few days, the base was completely destroyed and the Heimdall was able to head back to its home port in North America.
[134:31.60]However, approximately two days of travel from port, the Heimdall fell silent, failing to respond to any communication from NTA.
[134:41.04]Concerned about the Heimdall, a SPARC investigation team was put together and sent to determine what happened.
[134:47.36]Thanks for the Star Wars.
[134:48.38]Star Wars scrolling text.
[134:51.07]The Heimdall incident.
[134:54.55]Dot, dot, dot.
[134:55.21]Let's go.
[135:09.60]Eagle One to Comstat, turn heading three-zero-zero-six-seven.
[135:13.70]We got you with our communication sound.
[135:16.00]Turn two degrees to the east.
[135:18.06]Roger that.
[135:20.98]Lieutenant Manning, what is that?
[135:23.67]It's nothing.
[135:24.29]It's just part of my stuff.
[135:26.15]Who's in the picture?
[135:30.39]This?
[135:31.71]It's my brother.
[135:34.81]Oh, yeah.
[135:35.53]Your brother's on the Heimdall, right?
[135:37.64]That was a full almost three seconds of no lipsync.
[135:47.39]It was almost not even trying.
[135:51.33]Did somebody turn the vacuum off?
[135:52.87]I want to hear the dialogue, please.
[136:07.11]Dad is mowing the lawn, right next to your window, and you're in a goddamn intense 3v3 League of Legends matchup, and you're getting so irritated.
[136:18.82]He goes away, he's on his fucking riding mower, and he just drives by the window.
[136:28.38]And you're gonna mute your fucking mic.
[136:31.64]Mute!
[136:32.14]Oh, here we go.
[136:56.07]He couldn't hear anything I was saying.
[136:57.15]Well, case in point, good.
[136:58.23]I'm glad the game made the point.
[137:09.87]I'm happy to give this game about 25 minutes.
[137:16.26]You just tried to tell a joke with your dad mowing the lawn.
[137:18.52]Yes, I... exactly.
[137:20.06]This is the maddest I've ever been.
[137:25.73]This is the maddest I've ever been in a video game.
[137:28.53]Stupid.
[137:29.19]Stupid.
[137:29.63]This game's fucking stupid.
[137:34.25]Why?
[137:35.18]Why did they shoot us down?
[137:40.24]Leonard, Lieutenant Manning.
[137:42.36]Am I the only one that made it?
[137:45.90]Is that... Leonard!
[137:50.18]So we're going to get the big reveal to see what happened to Leonard.
[137:58.41]Leonard, are you okay?
[138:00.01]No, he's okay.
[138:00.53]Hang on.
[138:03.01]Looks like my leg's no good.
[138:06.17]Your leg?
[138:07.59]Don't move it.
[138:08.47]I'll take care of it.
[138:11.52]Colonel Burke those goggles Won't do anything Colonel the helicopter was attacked Colonel the helicopter was attached He's giant ski goggles must be the work of Southern Cross The investigation and the other members are they okay
[138:39.29]I don't know where Lieutenant Manning is.
[138:41.11]She's disappeared.
[138:42.63]The pilot Leonard is with me now, but he's badly injured.
[138:46.05]I see.
[138:47.19]See if you can find a first aid kit and do what you can for Leonard.
[138:50.86]When you're done, begin your investigation.
[138:53.66]Yes, sir.
[138:54.72]I don't know what's going on, but it's clear that things are not what they seem.
[138:59.90]Maybe Leonard is safe... Make a Resident Evil 2 joke?
[139:02.60]Yeah, I'll leave him here.
[139:04.22]I'll check the ship and bring back any first aid supplies I can find.
[139:07.00]I can't.
[139:07.32]I haven't played it.
[139:08.18]I'm counting on you.
[139:09.93]We'll get back to the investigation on this end.
[139:12.87]Lang should be checking the ship data in the security room.
[139:16.13]When you're done, catch up with him and see what he's discovered.
[139:19.80]Then continue your investigation.
[139:22.12]Yes, sir, Colonel.
[139:23.40]Be careful.
[139:23.98]Wait for me, Leonard.
[139:25.96]I'll get a first aid kit.
[139:31.00]Diarrhea cramps again.
[139:37.47]I'm sorry, Jack.
[139:39.65]Apologizing.
[139:40.99]Do I have control of the character now?
[139:52.76]Is this going to be another tank controls game?
[139:55.78]Where you just walk around and shoot the one zombie that shows up and then grab the health kit?
[140:04.98]Well, I'm glad we're getting it out of the way.
[140:15.93]No scream?
[140:16.37]Did I get it in time?
[140:30.29]Leonard!
[140:31.07]What happened?
[140:35.84]It's his head!
[140:38.92]Leonard!
[140:43.27]Damn, why doesn't it move?
[140:46.26]His head?
[140:48.94]Oh, no, okay.
[140:49.58]What?
[140:50.76]Who the hell are you?
[140:51.62]It's a Los Plagas.
[141:09.72]I love that bird mouth.
[141:12.88]What the hell's going on?
[141:15.74]Leonard was... By that?
[141:22.18]Please, work!
[141:37.33]Leonard, I'm sorry.
[141:39.89]I wish I could have done something.
[141:42.73]The eyes shifting back and forth.
[141:46.25]Alright.
[141:46.77]Time for... How do I... How do I... Okay.
[141:50.03]How do I shoot?
[141:52.85]A. Dead?
[142:16.49]Yeah, it's just tank controls.
[142:42.00]Actually, not that bad.
[142:46.89]Upstairs.
[142:53.20]Dollar store Resident Evil?
[142:55.00]Well, more like $2 store.
[142:57.88]Or $30 or $40 on Amazon store.
[143:02.07]At least $10.
[143:04.93]This was at least $10 on the Amazon dollar store.
[143:15.49]Portside Elevator.
[143:16.33]That's an impractically long name for a store.
[143:33.60]Raided?
[143:34.30]We get a raid?
[143:37.56]What, uh, who came in with the raid?
[143:54.75]I see General Sam.
[143:58.17]General Sam, thanks for the raid.
[144:01.55]Welcome, everybody.
[144:06.68]General Sam.
[144:07.34]For those of you that are just joining us, this game, this is not something that you're typically going to see on this channel.
[144:17.14]It's not a good representation.
[144:19.10]Yes, it is.
[144:20.50]Welcome to the stream.
[144:21.14]Hope you had a good one, General Sam.
[144:26.89]This is not a good representation of what the stream is.
[144:33.92]I'm usually not playing a game like this.
[144:37.20]Usually I'm playing Dota 2.
[144:41.13]Or... Cards in real life.
[144:46.37]Just playing cards with a friend.
[144:50.03]A3 lock is written above the key slot.
[144:58.09]Okay.
[144:59.31]Go down here.
[144:59.89]Look at how dark this is.
[145:03.12]What does it say?
[145:03.90]Deck one security room.
[145:06.22]And medical.
[145:13.98]A1 written on the lock.
[145:15.38]Okay, slow down.
[145:25.25]It's just blue stinger, but slightly better.
[145:27.53]Hold on.
[145:29.91]Who is it?
[145:30.96]It's me, Lime.
[145:31.86]Jack?
[145:33.63]I heard from the colonel that you were shot down by the intercept system.
[145:37.51]I never thought I'd become the target of my own team.
[145:40.05]It's hard to believe.
[145:40.67]Such passion, such fear.
[145:41.73]I'm checking the system, but it only seems to get worse.
[145:45.64]At this rate, the whole ship will be affected.
[145:48.02]By the way... Somebody knocked on your hotel door and you walked up and asked that question.
[145:53.00]We were separated.
[145:54.32]I don't know what happened.
[145:56.03]As for the helicopter pilot, he was attacked by some sort of monster.
[146:00.86]He's dead.
[146:01.72]Monster?
[146:02.72]What do you mean?
[146:03.99]Huh?
[146:05.01]You didn't see them?
[146:06.61]The monsters that look like humans?
[146:09.21]No, I haven't seen anything.
[146:11.03]At least not on my way here.
[146:13.00]The intercept systems go on haywire.
[146:15.28]Something very strange is happening here.
[146:17.78]And if we don't figure out what's going on soon...
[146:21.27]Old.
[146:21.49]Old.
[146:21.57]Stupid.
[146:22.15]Where's the thumb drive?
[146:23.19]Stupid, dumb, old game.
[146:24.43]Where's the thumb drive, idiot?
[146:49.54]right yes sir there should be an ID card in the medical room in this area here take this you should stack up on medicines in case of an emergency yes sir
[147:15.97]This computer's running wild.
[147:18.03]It won't tell me anything about the ship.
[147:20.45]The security lock is complicated.
[147:22.77]What a pain.
[147:24.09]You better bring those disks soon.
[147:25.97]There's not much time.
[147:31.05]Somebody just said, I miss the kind old lady, Jerma.
[147:33.77]What?
[147:34.17]No, I read that completely wrong.
[147:35.81]The old Jerma used to walk old ladies across the street.
[147:40.28]When did I do that?
[147:45.78]Does this do anything?
[147:46.32]Do you wanna... no.
[147:48.06]There's something over here.
[147:51.52]Security system console.
[147:53.35]Seems to be active.
[147:53.97]There's a... something spinning around over there.
[147:58.53]Just... that's it?
[148:00.85]A3 ID card obtained.
[148:03.88]And DV tape obtained.
[148:07.44]That's how you know this is old.
[148:09.82]Doesn't help old ladies?
[148:11.04]Of course I do!
[148:12.73]If I'm on the sidewalk and an old lady comes up and she says, I say, yes, of course.
[148:21.44]What is it, ma'am?
[148:23.36]I'm looking to go across this walkway here and I need a little bit of help.
[148:30.03]I go, absolutely, ma'am, of course.
[148:32.44]And we get to the end, and we slowly go across, and make sure that, you know, she's stabilized and has enough room to go.
[148:40.04]We get across, and she gives, like, a little hug.
[148:42.50]Like, oh, thank you, my wonderful boy.
[148:45.44]And you're like, oh, have a great day, ma'am.
[148:48.18]And then, like, two or three hours later, you go into your wallet, because you're buying a drink.
[148:51.26]You're buying a round for all your friends.
[148:53.38]And, like, 60 bucks is gone.
[148:57.02]That's why I don't do it.
[149:10.92]What the fuck is going on in here?
[149:17.85]What happened?
[149:18.91]What's going on?
[149:19.43]I thought for a second I saw a dinosaur face.
[149:21.03]Hey, are you okay?
[149:24.15]Stop!
[149:24.85]Don't get any closer.
[149:26.02]Here comes the scientist.
[149:29.06]Who are you?
[149:30.30]Are you infected too?
[149:30.94]Here's the fucked up scientist.
[149:32.08]I'm Sergeant Ingles.
[149:33.66]I'm part of the SPARC team sent to investigate the ship.
[149:36.75]What are you doing here?
[149:38.89]VR goggles.
[149:45.38]Okay, the BEM-T3N scope.
[149:56.12]Developed by the NTA for infantry in the case of biological warfare, can be used to identify non-human lifeforms.
[150:02.90]See in the dark and see through some objects.
[150:10.63]I really have to scan this guy to find out that he's a zombie scanning danger what's going on what is going on don't you believe what you see somebody gave 50 a long time ago what how did I miss this the ship doctor
[150:37.03]I was getting my ass kicked.
[150:38.74]Oh, that's right.
[150:39.40]I was engrossed in self-pity playing Power Stone.
[151:02.18]I thought I just shot him.
[151:03.68]Those chains were not bound very well.
[151:30.15]He's dead.
[151:30.73]3, 2, 1.
[151:31.03]You're a very bad shot.
[151:32.75]You are terrible.
[151:33.55]What?
[151:52.34]Look around you.
[151:54.10]You can bet like four times.
[151:55.40]You will arrive in hell.
[151:58.12]I can't trust anyone anymore.
[152:02.40]Soon, soon, you too will feel the hopelessness.
[152:09.20]He did the... Okay.
[152:16.54]Well, I wasn't really ready for that.
[152:20.51]Okay, that... Am I stuck in a time loop here?
[152:29.03]Why did he just reverse time?
[152:34.37]Uh, A1 ID card.
[152:35.98]I needed that.
[152:36.46]Anything else in the room?
[152:38.56]There it is.
[152:40.34]Record of Research by Terry Adams.
[152:45.52]Somebody else will read this one.
[152:47.22]What?
[152:49.30]Carrots?
[152:53.20]What just fell out?
[152:56.28]An evil carrot just jumped out at me.
[153:00.03]What?
[153:00.49]There's more?
[153:05.77]More Nickelodeon splat sound effects, too.
[153:08.13]If you keep them scored.
[153:17.43]Can I please shoot this?
[153:24.44]If I die to the fucking Nickelodeon carrot, I'm gonna be very upset.
[153:33.91]Okay.
[153:40.15]Nothing, there's nothing useful here.
[153:45.14]So let's go.
[153:45.66]I got the A1 card.
[153:46.56]Do I have any healing items?
[153:56.93]A1 was down this way.
[154:03.62]Use.
[154:05.98]Energy drink, yep.
[154:06.98]Use it.
[154:08.40]That's not very much health.
[154:09.24]Alright, equip, uh... Where's my... Where's my helmet?
[154:15.54]No, don't... Welder.
[154:18.31]Look.
[154:19.27]Okay.
[154:20.13]Use it.
[154:23.85]Just turn everything kind of sepia.
[154:26.97]Uh-oh.
[154:28.79]At least there are enemies in this game.
[154:38.55]The last two survival horror games we played, people barely had to... There were no enemies.
[154:48.56]Alright, what's in here?
[154:49.24]Let's find out.
[154:56.71]Which ones were survival horror?
[154:58.47]The Ring.
[155:01.15]The Ring was one of them.
[155:03.05]Then Blue Stinger.
[155:07.21]That's not even a survival horror.
[155:14.76]Hoigel was horror, maybe.
[155:23.26]Bird?
[155:25.16]Okay, this is a jump scare.
[155:26.36]There's an octopus, giant plant octopus thing in here.
[155:33.48]The wavelengths aren't even matched up either.
[155:51.38]Leonard?
[155:51.56]You could at least match up the wavelengths.
[155:54.58]He was attacked and killed by some creature on the flight deck.
[155:57.78]What?
[155:59.38]I couldn't get to him in time.
[156:00.72]I'm so sorry.
[156:01.68]No, there's nothing to apologize about.
[156:03.58]I was the one who said the flight deck was safe.
[156:08.19]Colonel.
[156:09.23]Sorry, this is no time to get emotional.
[156:12.01]We have to concentrate on the mission.
[156:14.39]Yes, sir.
[156:15.13]What happened to the creature that attacked me?
[156:17.83]It came down and attacked me, so I killed it.
[156:23.75]The elevator was damaged, so I couldn't go up and check.
[156:27.56]Until I went below, it was just me and Leonard on the flight deck.
[156:31.96]Just start humming it in your head because it's gonna come soon enough.
[156:36.30]Let's go.
[156:36.72]Let's do it.
[157:02.27]Yes, sir.
[157:03.75]What happened to the creature that attacked you?
[157:05.01]It came down and attacked me.
[157:06.19]Alright, we're going speedrun.
[157:09.62]One death, permanent death.
[157:29.53]Go.
[157:35.48]Head gone.
[157:35.98]Perfect.
[157:37.70]Nothing over here?
[157:48.87]Another cutscene.
[157:49.75]Radio room.
[157:50.43]This thing's gonna jump up.
[157:50.99]He thought that guy was alive.
[158:05.78]I'm angry at that guy.
[158:06.68]Stop.
[158:07.28]Stop.
[158:31.37]Over here in Chicago, we're calling from a long ways away.
[158:35.81]That was essentially all that guy's dialogue.
[159:00.70]Nothing in here that I need to grab or touch or do?
[159:03.88]Dead body in the chair.
[159:04.72]He must have been attacked while using the transmitter.
[159:06.50]Okay.
[159:11.22]Muzzle flash is flash light.
[159:12.60]You're right.
[159:13.38]But... Alright, let's see.
[159:27.42]There's a door over this way.
[159:39.69]No, that's just the way I came.
[159:44.50]I gotta go till you die.
[159:49.92]What if I just don't die?
[159:51.24]That would be really unfortunate.
[159:53.74]For all of us.
[159:59.47]Who are you?
[159:59.97]What?
[160:01.32]I'm Sergeant Ingles.
[160:02.70]I'm part of the SPARC team sent by NTA.
[160:05.44]Man, you were lucky to make it this far.
[160:07.46]Was the intercept system deactivated?
[160:09.42]No, it destroyed the helicopter we came in on.
[160:12.76]It's hopeless.
[160:13.88]It's impossible to leave.
[160:15.92]Don't give up.
[160:17.00]We'll deactivate the system somehow.
[160:19.17]Do you know where it is?
[160:21.23]He's got a good YouTuber voice.
[160:22.09]Yeah, he does.
[160:22.57]That's the second one.
[160:23.69]That's what I needed.
[160:24.29]Nope.
[160:24.43]Can't do it.
[160:55.60]Let's go.
[161:01.06]How do I find these games?
[161:02.00]Well, this is just on Dreamcast.
[161:03.18]This is only on Dreamcast.
[161:06.06]And the last couple of nights we've been playing Dreamcast games.
[161:10.52]Some of the most defining.
[161:14.16]Genre defining, even.
[161:16.00]Video games came from the Dreamcast.
[161:20.84]And we're seeing why.
[161:32.93]He went right for the neck.
[161:33.93]Uh, iron gate.
[161:36.06]Looks like it would take a bomb to open it.
[161:39.00]It's locked.
[161:39.44]A2.
[161:39.68]Uh oh.
[161:49.93]This might end very quickly.
[161:54.71]Is there another door?
[162:00.51]People act like PS2 didn't have bad games.
[162:02.63]No, Dreamcast has a lot of great games.
[162:10.68]No, the door.
[162:16.16]No.
[162:16.90]I went all the way to the end.
[162:19.42]Look at this great game.
[162:20.22]Well, this is not a look at this great game.
[162:21.78]This is look at this exclusive.
[162:32.18]Go this way.
[162:42.25]Why have I only played the bad ones?
[162:44.17]Well, because all the good ones are ported to PC.
[162:46.65]So stuff like Shenmue is just a better version on PC.
[162:50.83]Jet Set Radio is on PC.
[162:54.68]Sonic Adventure is on PC.
[162:56.36]Space Channel 5 is on PC.
[162:58.34]And those games are a lot of money.
[163:00.33]So I got the ports for those ones, and we're going to play them.
[163:03.51]But these are the physical discs that you can't get anywhere else unless you emulate these games.
[163:11.29]Space Channel 5, yeah, is on PC.
[163:13.35]I was completely unaware of that as well.
[163:18.41]I was shocked when I saw the actual Dreamcast collection on Steam.
[163:21.68]It's on Steam.
[163:23.96]Alright, where was I?
[163:24.54]Back here?
[163:32.39]Yeah, Dreamcast Sonic Adventure is probably better.
[163:35.97]But, I mean, I can still get it.
[163:37.09]Alright, let me go through this door.
[163:45.18]Sonic Adventure is actual dogshit if you haven't played it recently.
[163:53.44]Now I'm scared.
[163:54.08]Is somebody hiding behind a locker?
[164:03.64]I don't... What happened?
[164:07.89]Who is... Is that me?
[164:08.91]I don't see anything.
[164:17.01]Did that guy run into the locker and then the game delayed his fall down by 10 straight seconds?
[164:22.78]Or was he supposed to get sucked in and grabbed into the locker?
[164:26.72]No, it's an invisible man.
[164:34.18]what the scope well he's going to use the infrared but good don't use my bolts I'll take care of it you stay in the locker
[165:06.65]It's okay.
[165:07.41]You can come out.
[165:17.77]You're Jack.
[165:18.79]Bob's brother.
[165:19.89]You know Bob?
[165:21.43]I know Bob.
[165:25.01]Yeah, he runs the dog stand down the fucking street.
[165:27.38]You must be Eddie from Bob's Outfit.
[165:29.54]You got it.
[165:33.10]I'm glad you're okay.
[165:34.99]Was Bob with you?
[165:36.65]I lost track of him when the mutants came.
[165:39.05]Nah, I lost track of Bob.
[165:40.71]Oh.
[165:43.07]I'm sorry.
[165:44.63]It's okay.
[165:45.49]I'm glad to see you're okay.
[165:47.25]It's not safe here.
[165:48.57]You should go to the flight deck.
[165:52.65]Okay.
[165:53.47]Be careful, Sergeant.
[165:55.14]Thanks.
[165:56.26]Hurry.
[165:57.44]Yeah.
[166:08.25]Medkit, we still go.
[166:10.25]I go until I die.
[166:16.47]We go until I... Never mind.
[166:18.77]I thought about it for a second.
[166:31.89]Use the heal.
[166:32.39]I have six shots left.
[166:43.72]Full stream of Carrier incoming.
[166:45.42]I don't think that's gonna happen.
[166:59.47]R2?
[166:59.59]No, just run.
[167:00.13]This game doesn't look that bad.
[167:09.67]It's not that bad.
[167:10.61]None of these games are that bad.
[167:16.67]These games came out before some of you guys were even born.
[167:21.09]So, you gotta give a little bit of credit.
[167:27.87]Just run.
[167:34.06]What's wrong with me?
[167:36.68]Why did I just do that?
[167:37.88]Did I just puke?
[167:40.14]Did I just shit my pants and say no?
[167:54.03]Help me!
[167:55.15]It's going to kill me!
[167:57.09]It's a monster!
[167:59.21]Don't let it fool you, son!
[168:01.73]It's going to kill me!
[168:04.69]It's you without a mustache.
[168:06.93]Who do I shoot?
[168:07.57]Who do I shoot?
[168:08.10]I made the right call.
[168:21.08]Oh, it's a good thing you're able to figure it out.
[168:23.66]How you doing?
[168:24.14]I'm Alan.
[168:25.20]I'm Sergeant Inglis from SPARC.
[168:27.29]I'm asking all survivors to go to the flight deck.
[168:30.15]You should go there too.
[168:31.85]The flight deck?
[168:33.97]There are no safe places left on this here ship.
[168:37.53]Well, you must have noticed by now the whole ship is screwed up, son.
[168:41.42]It's impossible to tell who's on our side and who is not.
[168:45.26]You can't trust anyone but yourself.
[168:48.61]I hope it's facial hair.
[168:49.23]That means you too.
[168:49.93]Thanks.
[168:50.95]But I'll make my own decisions.
[168:52.57]That's how you want it.
[168:53.63]Good luck.
[168:54.55]I've got work to do.
[168:55.77]Be careful.
[168:56.88]You too.
[168:57.94]Here, you better take this.
[168:59.92]By the way, son, thanks for saving my butt.
[169:04.32]Three energy drinks.
[169:06.50]Level three.
[169:07.16]No, level three energy drink.
[169:08.66]Whatever it was.
[169:09.22]That's a full heal.
[169:16.96]Level three.
[169:22.90]Alright, what we got?
[169:23.84]Control panel.
[169:24.38]Is it ammo?
[169:29.86]What is it?
[169:30.95]Activation disk obtained.
[169:34.87]For what room?
[169:38.15]Activation disk.
[170:02.43]I just healed, too.
[170:03.63]Really?
[170:06.01]What is... Oh, the invisible guys.
[170:07.67]I forgot about the stupid invisibility bullshit.
[170:14.71]Excuse me.
[170:20.93]No other doors.
[170:27.15]There's one right here.
[170:32.68]God damn it, kill him.
[170:34.08]Everybody wants me to lose so bad.
[170:42.56]Everybody's rooting for me to lose.
[170:47.87]This is spooky.
[170:48.97]Come on.
[171:09.88]Alright, we got our first major encounter, I think.
[171:12.94]How's the speedrun looking?
[171:25.95]Somebody said this game hurts to look at.
[171:29.54]Well, it is an old game.
[171:30.78]Anything over here?
[171:42.68]Goddamn tank.
[171:55.74]It has no lighting and zero art direction.
[172:00.04]This is kind of a blob, isn't it?
[172:03.40]Is there no reason to come out here?
[172:04.30]It was a two-hour speedrun of this game.
[172:10.38]How long is the game itself, then?
[172:18.27]Two hours for a speedrun.
[172:19.23]This game's probably like 15 to 20 hours long.
[172:24.75]Well, I'm looking forward to it, because there's no way I'm gonna die.
[172:30.22]LOL, and then he dies when he gets up to the top of the ladder.
[172:34.24]Wouldn't that be funny?
[172:51.43]Alright, going up Shadow Moses.
[172:55.13]Wait till I get my codec call.
[173:02.73]Jack, do you copy?
[173:05.12]Jack?
[173:06.10]Sir, this is Jack.
[173:07.24]Can you give me a report of your current situation?
[173:10.04]Sir, I'm on my way to the bridge.
[173:11.92]The partition for the corridor to Deck 2 is closed.
[173:14.68]Captain Lang is in the security room trying to open it.
[173:17.44]And I'm looking for the necessary disks.
[173:19.50]Got it.
[173:27.18]T7 bomb.
[173:29.18]Deck one weapon storage.
[173:32.80]Can't they just turn those lights on?
[173:36.73]Is that a pair of underwear?
[173:39.21]No.
[174:07.97]Yeah, there was that door downstairs that needed a bomb.
[174:14.44]That guy's going to stand up after I grab the disc.
[174:17.86]Ship's log.
[174:18.58]That's a full month.
[174:24.98]Visibility's good and the radar is still operating.
[174:26.76]We're going to get a good view of the... Don't trust anybody.
[174:40.11]Still raining.
[174:40.71]Doesn't look like it will stop soon.
[174:50.45]Okay.
[174:50.85]Well, like... He was probably alive?
[174:57.19]Well, I don't know.
[174:58.75]I saw a guy and had to shoot.
[175:00.12]If I get hit one more time, I'm dead.
[175:14.82]Yeah, that's not the Wilhelm scream.
[175:17.88]That's called the Tantrum scream?
[175:20.94]Is that what it is?
[175:28.11]Stay away from me!
[175:29.55]Calm down, I'm part of the Spark Team.
[175:31.31]Spark Team?
[175:33.65]Yeah, we're evacuating survivors to the flight deck.
[175:36.59]This guy's a liar.
[175:38.05]Do you know a pilot named Bob Ingles?
[175:40.23]Bob?
[175:41.31]Shoot this guy.
[175:41.77]It is.
[175:41.99]Why?
[175:42.13]Why was that used in every form of video?
[176:10.30]Was it there as a joke?
[176:18.15]It was just an inside joke.
[176:31.19]I'm not doing so hot.
[176:32.86]There we go, energy drink.
[176:39.46]Use energy drink.
[176:40.48]Look at that.
[176:42.04]I really had one HP.
[176:44.82]So I gotta go down to A... A2, right?
[176:56.21]Where's the map?
[176:57.74]Look at the map.
[177:01.16]Where's the map?
[177:02.58]Where's the map?
[177:07.62]A2 doors.
[177:08.46]I need like an A2 map.
[177:13.62]No one's paying attention.
[177:16.30]No one's paying attention.
[177:23.32]Actually, I don't think it's that bad.
[177:25.12]I think it's actually not bad.
[177:37.68]Tony Hawk waiting room don't you worry I Will show you a 1 million point string You understand Now I would like somebody to cut From what I just said right there about 30 minutes from now potentially when I am repeating over and over again It's fucking impossible like it's very it's it's stupid in fact overlay my voice I
[178:06.48]Ready?
[178:06.80]I'll go for it.
[178:10.08]The controls are fucking dumb.
[178:12.33]I pressed the button and it didn't do anything.
[178:15.33]It just doesn't really hold up.
[178:20.73]Oh my fucking god.
[178:22.65]This is so stupid.
[178:24.33]I clearly was grinding that rail.
[178:29.96]It's so unbearable.
[178:33.26]I would like for you guys to clip that over.
[178:36.04]Just... lay it on top of it.
[178:43.53]Better actor than people in the game.
[178:45.45]Okay, I need door A2.
[179:03.84]What game is this?
[179:04.42]This is... I can't... I gotta... Nope.
[179:10.84]How's that for a Tony Hawk rail grind?
[179:15.79]Oh, no, here's another great one.
[179:16.91]Here's another classic.
[179:18.63]I'm sorry, guys.
[179:19.21]I just... I don't have it today.
[179:20.77]I just don't... I don't have it.
[179:22.07]I'm gonna try this one more time, and then we'll see what happens.
[179:26.53]That's a classic, right?
[179:31.72]Alright, I need A2.
[179:34.06]Is that an A2 door right there?
[179:39.74]Oh, the invisible guy.
[179:41.08]Shit.
[179:45.06]Do I have any more heals?
[179:48.33]I don't.
[179:48.61]No, don't rip around that way!
[179:53.73]Go!
[179:55.67]Wasn't there a locked door, like, over here?
[180:07.15]The map is in the menu.
[180:08.67]Pause menu.
[180:09.35]Oh, okay.
[180:12.30]Where the hell even am I?
[180:15.58]I don't know what deck I'm on.
[180:16.80]Okay, I'm right there.
[180:19.10]So, I gotta go.
[180:20.08]Ah, this is not even that bad of a game.
[180:24.24]It just isn't.
[180:26.70]So, I gotta go out and then through.
[180:29.28]Is that A2, though?
[180:34.09]Radio room, main passageway, so I gotta go down the hall and through the door on the left.
[180:46.51]Guess I'm in the wrong room, but can I heal in here?
[180:52.02]Alright, so it's the door on the left.
[180:53.28]I don't know if I'm gonna make it through this door.
[181:04.28]Why is this not playing?
[181:21.70]I had it queued up too.
[181:30.57]Alright, let's get Tony Hawk rolling.
[181:33.03]This game is kind of cool.
[181:34.49]It was.
[181:38.80]It wasn't that bad.
[181:40.78]The game gave you those key cards and you just had to kind of see where the doors were locked.
[181:44.84]It wasn't confusing.
[181:46.94]If I gave a shit, I would probably sit there and play it for a while.
[181:52.74]He's getting defensive about this sucky game.
[181:54.94]What?
[181:56.28]I think it's fun.
[181:58.72]Well, this is what everybody came here for.
[182:02.18]The best version of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2, if you ask any expert in the industry, you ask anybody in the field, you ask anybody in your friend group, anybody that you know, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2, for the Dreamcast, is the best version of the game.
[182:17.23]That is just a fact, and we're about to play it.
[182:22.20]Somebody just said wrong.
[182:25.48]I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to disagree with you.
[182:33.56]And... The disc is not in here.
[182:38.20]Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 inside here is actually... There's a mistake.
[182:43.37]The disc is not in here.
[182:44.25]This is actually... Shenmue 2 is in here.
[182:50.05]So I got scammed.
[182:59.72]Might as well put it in and see what happens.
[183:07.83]Alright, let's actually rename this Tony Hawk, because I'm gonna be here for a while, because I love this game.
[183:15.45]This is no longer just a straight-up Dreamcast fuckface stream.
[183:23.35]This is now a Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 stream.
[183:32.95]And I'm looking forward to it, because it's a great game.
[183:41.20]Now the real stream begins.
[183:42.62]I can say that.
[183:44.56]But I want to touch... Stormy Chu gave $50 earlier and I need to address it because that's a lot of money.
[183:51.32]Pizza Hut burgers taste like boogies and you know it's true.
[183:54.62]Hungry Howies is superior in every way.
[183:57.72]Also, I need to remind you that you're the best streamer and can always make me and chat have a good laugh.
[184:01.30]That's good.
[184:02.70]Thank you.
[184:04.66]I've never heard of Hungry Howies.
[184:08.37]I don't know where that is.
[184:10.74]Uh, by the way, rip VOD.
[184:12.84]Say, uh, rest in peace to the VOD.
[184:15.36]But I'm not gonna turn the music off in this game because it's one of the major parts to play it.
[184:20.46]So... Sorry.
[184:23.21]This is the best Tony Hawk.
[184:32.74]This is the classic.
[184:34.18]It's the best.
[184:36.81]They will never make a better skating game than Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2.
[184:42.43]And everyone that wants to argue, what about Skate 3?
[184:44.07]Well, I've never played it, so... I've heard it was okay.
[184:56.09]Alright.
[184:59.84]Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2.
[185:03.90]Let's get some stuff going here.
[185:06.57]If I want to do a full career, yes, of course I'm going to do that.
[185:09.45]Welcome to the next eight hours.
[185:11.97]I can't wait.
[185:12.51]I'm so excited.
[185:13.21]I actually am.
[185:17.43]I've been waiting a long time to get this green cast controller in my hand.
[185:21.89]For this.
[185:25.68]But unfortunately, that's going to be the end of tonight's stream.
[185:29.56]Because I have some stuff I've got to do tomorrow.
[185:36.91]But really though, I'm gonna go pee.
[185:38.33]And I'm gonna get myself prepared.
[185:39.41]I'll be right back.
