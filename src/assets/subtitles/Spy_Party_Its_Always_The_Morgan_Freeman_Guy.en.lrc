[00:02.39]Welcome back to Spy Party.
[00:05.13]In this episode, we're going to return to the game that... Just making duck noises, that's fine.
[00:12.63]That's great.
[00:13.19]Um, we're gonna be playing Spy Party again, because it was just recently updated.
[00:27.30]Oh, that looks fancy.
[00:28.50]There's now an option to complete one known mission.
[00:30.64]We're gonna do that.
[00:32.02]I only have one thing I have to do.
[00:35.56]That's going to be too easy.
[00:37.34]All I have to do is... Oh, here we go.
[00:39.06]Look at these new models.
[00:41.06]And there he is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43.23]The new Monopoly guy.
[00:45.47]Actually, can I be the old Monopoly guy too?
[00:47.81]No!
[00:48.57]What?
[00:50.07]There's only like four people you can choose from.
[00:58.24]I wonder which character Jerma picked.
[01:00.32]There's a guy with a...
[01:04.77]See?
[01:05.57]It wasn't the Monopoly guy!
[01:06.81]It was me, a disk lady!
[01:11.53]This is... There's only five people at this party.
[01:15.54]What a shitty party.
[01:17.66]Oh, I had a party.
[01:19.00]You wanna come to my party?
[01:20.06]Only four people showed up.
[01:23.30]Why?
[01:23.52]It's a small world.
[01:25.85]This is a pretty huge house for, like, five people.
[01:28.87]You see the one guy who doesn't belong yet?
[01:35.68]No one talked to that guy.
[01:37.48]And I think you know now that that can't possibly be me.
[01:43.54]That is so funny.
[01:44.44]It's like, oh, we have, like, look at character model.
[01:46.34]Animation's, like, beautiful.
[01:47.68]Then, like, the Muppet in the red.
[01:50.70]Well, I got the one known mission.
[01:53.02]No shit!
[01:54.54]Oh!
[01:55.66]I was Morgan Freeman the whole time!
[01:57.78]I was trying to shoot the Monopoly guy.
[02:05.44]Contact double agent is your only mission?
[02:07.86]Yes.
[02:08.74]So you're gonna win.
[02:09.62]Like, easily.
[02:12.83]Okay, I did my mission.
[02:14.15]Time for you to shoot somebody.
[02:15.27]Guess who it is.
[02:16.09]I was more of a freak.
[02:23.60]Why did you shoot him?
[02:25.36]It couldn't be him.
[02:27.48]I don't know.
[02:27.94]I just, like, thought it was him.
[02:30.68]Look at this, like, comparison.
[02:33.00]Look at these two faces.
[02:37.20]So hold on, that one guy that just does not belong, he can't be anything.
[02:45.73]Literally, I can't make him the ambassador.
[02:47.65]I can't make him, I can't pick him.
[02:49.93]That's the point, that's what I'm saying.
[02:51.67]You know he is completely irrelevant and you shoot him?
[02:55.23]I didn't know he was like that completely irrelevant.
[02:57.33]I thought you could at least like pick him or something.
[03:00.17]So why is he here?
[03:02.37]Why is this guy here?
[03:04.66]What is this guy's purpose?
[03:05.98]Like, what purpose does this guy serve?
[03:07.48]Hey, look at the top of the screen.
[03:10.10]Oh, yeah, I know.
[03:10.86]Very early work in progress.
[03:15.23]I'm gonna get you.
[03:15.95]I love how Morgan Freeman has a cane.
[03:18.99]Why does Morgan Freeman have a cane?
[03:22.13]I don't know.
[03:22.97]He's not that old.
[03:24.68]Is that his wife, like, standing right next to him?
[03:26.82]Oh, he's planting the bug on him.
[03:28.90]Oh, look out!
[03:34.37]This is fucking impossible, by the way.
[03:37.77]There's only four people in this room.
[03:39.87]How the hell are you going to see me do this every time?
[03:44.96]I don't know.
[03:45.48]I'm kind of not paying that much attention right now, to be honest with you.
[03:49.32]What?
[03:49.52]You're paying attention to, like, the guy over here?
[03:58.57]That's you, wasn't it?
[03:59.57]You know what gave you away?
[04:00.67]What?
[04:01.71]You tapped your key, like, once, and your character shifted, like, eh.
[04:05.61]And I was like, dude, they don't do that.
[04:08.00]Okay, he was the, like, new Monopoly guy.
[04:10.68]Big surprise, Jerma.
[04:13.14]We're gonna do something here.
[04:15.46]Because there's only five people in this room, and one of them does not matter at all in the slightest...
[04:22.88]I'm going... There's a 20% chance, no, 25% chance that I'm going to kill you instantly.
[04:35.13]Damn it, you were fucking Morgan Freeman again!
[04:36.87]I don't know how you're not catching on to this.
[04:40.07]This is like the same thing from the first video.
[04:45.67]I will keep that in mind, that it's always Morgan Freeman.
[04:48.07]Well, no, see, this is where I metagame you.
[04:50.26]No, you're not gonna metagame me.
[04:51.40]I already know what you're doing.
[04:54.28]You see, oh, it's always Morgan Freeman, but no, no, no.
[04:57.26]You see, you're not going to pick Morgan Freeman now.
[05:01.16]You're gonna be like Cruella de Vil from 101 Dalmatians.
[05:05.02]Game over, I win.
[05:08.82]I told you!
[05:13.48]Alright, no, no, it's still the old models.
[05:16.42]It's still the old models when you go back to, like, the other missions.
[05:19.69]Oh, well, it's open bay today.
[05:20.95]Today's a good day to do it.
[05:23.91]Oh yeah, this has been a great experience.
[05:30.65]Great experience, Jerm.
[05:31.95]I'm glad I got to play this game with you, okay?
[05:36.67]I just couldn't wait to do this.
[05:47.15]You want to go again?
[05:48.05]Yes.
[05:48.73]Just do a few more of these?
[05:49.95]I want to do one.
[05:54.13]I wanna do another one.
[05:55.21]I wanna go back to this one again.
[05:57.28]One mission.
[05:59.12]I wanna do... Alright.
[06:06.62]Let's go.
[06:08.10]You and me, baby.
[06:10.26]It's on now.
[06:11.58]Do you wanna just keep doing this?
[06:19.33]I don't understand, like, why you didn't think I would know what you're doing here?
[06:26.71]Are we done?
[06:27.43]Yeah.
[06:31.51]Okay, good.
[06:34.38]We're done.
[06:35.82]The guy who doesn't fit in is just scratching his head on my screen like, what the?
[06:40.92]Morgan Freeman again.
[06:42.00]That was so stupid.
