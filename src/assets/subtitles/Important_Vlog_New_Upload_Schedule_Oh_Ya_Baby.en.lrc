[00:08.44]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.02]Jerma here with a vlog.
[00:12.40]A very, very important vlog.
[00:14.06]Because we need to talk about some stuff.
[00:17.39]Alright, we got that out of our system now.
[00:20.25]So, what we're going to talk about today is schedules.
[00:24.25]I'm like swallowing my own mouth here.
[00:26.51]Schedules and when I'm going to upload certain videos.
[00:29.59]And sort of channel identity now.
[00:31.94]Because for the longest time, this channel has been...
[00:35.50]TF2 and everything else.
[00:38.44]And I kind of want to change that.
[00:39.52]I want to make it like, instead of it just being like TF2 and then, oh, there's like the rest of like the, here's all the other videos.
[00:46.49]Like whatever, miscellaneous, I don't even give a shit.
[00:49.25]Instead of that, I want to really set in stone dates and specific days for all these different videos.
[00:55.64]So you can know exactly when something is going to happen and
[00:59.14]whether it's something like TF2 or smite or little gems scare saturdays enlighten I'm bringing that back by the way so let's go over this right now I'm going to go as quickly as I can looking at the screen I'm going to try to put my hands on the right spot here anyways every Tuesday and every Saturday are going to be the Team Fortress two days
[01:21.19]Every single Tuesday, you can know there's going to be a TF2 video, and every Saturday.
[01:25.23]Now, that does not mean that these are the only days where you're going to see Team Fortress 2.
[01:30.97]That just means those are the days where... I'm going to bump the microphone here.
[01:33.67]Those are just the days where you know you're going to expect a Team Fortress 2 video.
[01:38.07]It could be Facecam Fortress, it could be a post-com, anything like that, live-com, anything that has to do with Team Fortress 2 will always be on those two days.
[01:47.26]Also, on top of that, every Sunday is going to be Smite.
[01:52.30]Whether it's a god breakdown or... Hold on.
[01:54.44]Oh, sorry.
[01:56.77]Smite.
[01:57.35]So Sunday is going to be the Smite day.
[01:59.07]Every single Sunday, you're going to get a Smite video.
[02:01.69]It could be, like I said, a god breakdown or a live comm or a good gameplay.
[02:04.57]Anything like that.
[02:05.77]Also... Where's Friday?
[02:09.06]Every Friday, this is probably the same spot as Saturday.
[02:11.56]When I look over this again, I'm going to be like an idiot.
[02:13.64]But this is, Friday should be like right here somewhere.
[02:16.50]Every Friday, there's going to be a podcast on this channel.
[02:19.56]Kind of like the Blacklight video I did like four, three or four days ago now, where I talk about a gaming topic, something in the news, something like a personal story, something very podcasty and self-casty will be every single Friday.
[02:33.83]Not to mention that also on Saturday will be Scare Saturdays as well, because I'm bringing that back.
[02:39.19]So now that we have this kind of... Also, Saturday is a multi-upload day, so you can keep that in mind as well when you're looking at the schedule, baby.
[02:48.01]But anyways, Wednesday.
[02:50.24]I think we're in Wednesday.
[02:51.62]Yes, potentially.
[02:52.90]I have no idea.
[02:54.18]This is where I'm going to show Little Gems.
[02:57.02]or an enlighten I'm going to try and bring back enlighten as best as I possibly can if you don't know what that is enlightened was an old series I did on this channel where I would bring back an old game a pretty old at least 10 years at least like 8 to 12 years old and I would showcase it and tell you why I liked it so much so that's going to be coming back hopefully maybe once every two weeks it'll be there'll be two little gems and two enlightens every month that's the plan
[03:22.35]now you're probably wondering after looking at this like smorgasbord of a schedule right now what about Monday and this has been a lot more harder than I thought it was going to be what about Monday and what about Thursday are you just not going to make a video on Monday and Thursday no
[03:37.59]What that means is that those are just the days that don't have anything set in stone.
[03:42.68]So I might not make a video, but then again, I may.
[03:45.38]You might see like two TF2 videos in a row or like maybe when I'm playing like a brand new game that comes out or I'm having fun with a game with some friends or something, that's where that will go.
[03:55.82]So don't think that just because there's nothing listed for Monday and Thursday that nothing is going to be there because there is potential for something to absolutely go there.
[04:05.39]Alright, so can we get rid of this now?
[04:06.69]Let's get rid of this.
[04:08.79]It's gone.
[04:09.45]So I want to make sure that everybody's on the same page.
[04:12.07]We all know what's going to be happening on certain days.
[04:14.15]Maybe you get an extra video during the week at some point.
[04:16.55]Maybe you don't.
[04:17.47]But as long as you know what's happening, there won't be any more of, hey, when's the next Facecam Fortress?
[04:23.86]Or when's the next Scare Saturdays?
[04:26.20]It's all going to be here for at least the next few months.
[04:29.52]I'm not going to turn this off for no reason.
[04:33.12]I'm going to try this for at least a couple months.
[04:35.22]maybe 60 to 90 days and we'll see how it goes and please let me know what you think please in the comment section right there tell me what you think about this if you think this is a good idea I'd love to hear some suggestions if you have any so please let me know what you think and get ready for more videos baby he's warming up who's he gonna punch who are you gonna take care everybody bye
