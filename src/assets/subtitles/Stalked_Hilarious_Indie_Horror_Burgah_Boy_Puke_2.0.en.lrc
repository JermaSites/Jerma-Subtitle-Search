[00:10.69]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[00:12.05]Jermott here with Scare Saturdays.
[00:14.78]Gonna be playing Stocked tonight.
[00:17.60]And special guest, of course, you see him in the background, is Shit-Faced Burgah Boy.
[00:22.00]He went to a beer tasting, a beer drinking competition today.
[00:25.19]He drank like 40 beers in 10 seconds.
[00:30.17]Anyways, I'm playing Stalked tonight, which we are recording this after we actually played the game, and I do have to say very, very explicitly, stay and watch this whole video, because it is like the most hysterical friggin' game I've ever played in my life, and just the... What are you doing?
[00:50.22]Hello?
[00:50.94]Hello?
[00:51.68]Wake up, follow me.
[00:52.70]The stalker's here.
[00:54.18]It will kill us.
[00:55.28]This is Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:56.62]Reach the elevator and get out of here.
[01:00.22]Don't forget, never look at the stalker.
[01:02.39]Never look at the stalker.
[01:02.97]Come on, we have to get out of here.
[01:04.23]Oh my god.
[01:06.93]That is the best animation I've ever seen.
[01:09.47]Look at this guy's legs.
[01:12.59]What the fuck?
[01:17.99]Wow.
[01:18.89]Oh my god, that guy just died.
[01:21.21]That was actually kind of scary.
[01:23.15]Can I take his gun?
[01:23.99]Did I say the game was called Stalker or Stalked?
[01:27.09]Because I think it's Stalked.
[01:29.43]Give me your gun.
[01:31.53]Come on, we have to get out of here.
[01:33.35]This guy really is Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:36.34]Okay, I can't pick up the shotgun.
[01:39.32]Oh, sick like meat.
[01:41.62]Oh, that's like a person.
[01:43.22]That's like half upper torso.
[01:45.70]Oh, there's another one on the left and the right.
[01:49.47]There's like both halves.
[01:50.83]Jeez, that's pretty gross.
[01:52.27]He said never look at the stalker, so I have to look away from him.
[01:56.89]This reminds me of Doom.
[01:59.00]There he is.
[02:00.62]Yeah, this really does remind me of Doom.
[02:02.42]It looks just like Doom.
[02:03.60]It really does.
[02:04.76]Can I go over here?
[02:11.93]What?
[02:12.33]No, it's just like a dead body rotating.
[02:31.83]This is like, this would be scary right now.
[02:35.26]What the hell is going on?
[02:36.78]It's like claymation.
[02:47.52]I'm not even sure what I'm actually supposed to be doing right now.
[02:54.38]Specimen.
[02:58.48]You know, in all in all, even if like the graphics are crappy, they have like half torsos hanging everywhere.
[03:07.07]I know, even if they're, it kind of reminds me of like N64.
[03:08.91]It's like glow.
[03:12.62]What?
[03:12.98]What was that?
[03:15.11]blood stains on the wall.
[03:16.19]No, did you see like that flash of that like thing?
[03:18.07]I got a feeling he's gonna sprint right at me right now.
[03:27.94]No, there he is.
[03:28.82]Don't look at him.
[03:30.04]Do not look at him.
[03:31.14]That's the goal, huh?
[03:31.96]The goal is do not look at the stalker.
[03:34.61]Well then how did you know he's behind you?
[03:36.51]You freak!
[03:37.71]I didn't.
[03:38.51]I just saw him.
[03:39.07]You didn't see him?
[03:39.81]No.
[03:41.87]Oh, I can actually, I can sprint.
[03:44.06]Probably should have been doing that for like the longest time.
[03:46.16]Oh man, what's that, shift?
[03:48.40]No, shift.
[03:49.38]Shift.
[03:50.90]Get stalked.
[03:52.80]You're getting stalked by the Claymation Gumby character.
[03:56.80]You better shit your pants.
[03:59.80]Play fire!
[04:01.22]Alright, well, there's nothing over here.
[04:04.55]Oh!
[04:04.63]Wow, dude.
[04:05.69]Dude.
[04:06.15]We were just talking a bunch of, like, shit about this game, and I just, like, I just freaked out right there.
[04:10.93]I heard the keys.
[04:12.39]That was insane.
[04:18.28]Trixie they are.
[04:19.46]Okay, yeah, there it is.
[04:20.36]I just opened this.
[04:22.04]Oh.
[04:25.05]You could open, like, the garage door.
[04:27.49]Yeah.
[04:27.91]You hit the, like, garage door opener.
[04:30.15]We gotta take out the trash.
[04:33.58]Yeah, taking out the trash.
[04:34.42]That thing's ridiculous.
[04:38.36]It's, like, fat, but wicked fat.
[04:42.07]Oh, it's just a nightmare.
[04:45.77]What?
[04:47.45]Yeah, what I did I just opened this what was it.
[04:50.57]What was I supposed to do here now when you go out?
[04:53.06]Yeah, I know I Didn't even hear the noise that it made but it still scared me.
[04:58.58]I go to dead end
[05:18.35]What?
[05:18.57]There's a person up there.
[05:21.50]That was ridiculous, man.
[05:23.42]That was completely unexpected.
[05:24.70]Yeah.
[05:26.20]I don't even know where I'm supposed to be going here.
[05:28.40]I think this is back where we started, right?
[05:29.84]Yeah.
[05:30.94]Wow, I feel like I just got struck by lightning.
[05:33.19]Like, most games, like, you know, they'll just, like, come out of nowhere and just, like, you know, you'll hear a noise before you even see anything.
[05:40.07]You just saw something immediately.
[05:42.09]Yeah, that was insane.
[05:51.58]Don't wanna be, oh he's up top, he's up top, he's up top.
[05:57.19]I haven't been here before, I haven't been here before.
[05:59.25]Now I know that's gonna happen.
[06:05.45]Is this an elevator?
[06:14.64]Please don't appear in the elevator.
[06:21.82]That animation was the best.
[06:24.58]This game's awesome.
[06:25.92]This game's great.
[06:52.55]I launched, I launched out of the seat, did you see that?
[06:54.77]He's gonna puke again!
[06:55.66]He's gonna puke again!
