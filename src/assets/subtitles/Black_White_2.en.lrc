[02:35.67]Okay.

[02:38.65]Are we ready to begin?
[02:41.31]Black and white.
[02:43.39]Two.
[02:47.65]Here we go.
[02:51.86]Oh, spoilers.
[02:52.50]No, no, no spoilers.
[02:53.22]No spoilers.
[02:53.68]Alright, let's get out of this.
[02:54.36]I don't want to know what's possible.
[02:58.68]I want to get in here blind.
[03:02.96]This is Black and White 2.
[03:04.20]I just loaded it to check out to make sure it could get captured well and that it was a 1080 fucking P, dude.
[03:12.47]And it is.
[03:12.85]I got all the fan patches to make sure the game runs.
[03:18.11]Let's hope we got a good case here.
[03:20.97]New game.
[03:25.26]Let's go.
[03:26.26]Are you guys ready for the move, crew?
[03:28.60]This is the beginning.
[03:33.72]The birth of a god.
[03:39.10]Called by one pure prayer.
[03:42.45]Seven hundred.
[03:44.77]Born out of desperation.
[03:50.07]To be a god.
[03:51.90]To wield the power of good and evil.
[03:55.04]That is your destiny.
[04:04.96]So I'm a meteor that's about to crash into Earth?
[04:16.60]I'm coming!
[04:20.05]I've answered your prayers.
[04:21.65]We're back on God Island, like last game.
[04:25.19]Looks way better than the last one.
[04:27.83]This is how you control the game.
[04:29.02]Yes!
[04:29.12]Who is it gonna be?
[04:29.64]What do you guys think?
[04:30.64]Who's it gonna be?
[04:31.54]I wonder.
[04:54.85]Hmm.
[04:57.73]There they are.
[04:59.63]Wonderful, aren't they?
[05:01.11]You have four to choose from.
[05:03.75]But the one you choose will be with you throughout your whole time in this world.
[05:09.85]So consider carefully.
[05:11.34]Monkey?
[05:12.00]No.
[05:12.16]And make your choice wisely.
[05:14.56]Absolutely not.
[05:15.10]Let us tell you about these amazing beasts.
[05:18.58]All creatures can be trained to become lovable mischievous pets.
[05:23.80]Or they can be the ultimate disciplined weapons of destruction and war.
[05:28.91]Look at VRAs.
[05:31.33]He's just so cheery.
[05:32.79]Don't stop zooming in on the monkey.
[05:36.43]I wanna see the- I wanna see the- Oh shit.
[05:38.61]The graphics is so much better.
[05:39.51]Can I see what the other ones look like when they get older?
[05:59.40]All creatures will be as good or evil as you teach them to be.
[06:03.92]Now snooze.
[06:08.38]Boring.
[06:09.54]Snore.
[06:11.16]Snore.
[06:12.60]Yeah, right.
[06:13.72]I'd rather they spread love in the form of a massacre or two by going into battle.
[06:18.51]Is that a wolf or a hyena?
[06:19.61]Creatures can live for war, domination, and destruction.
[06:25.76]Such a shame if you ask me.
[06:27.12]No, I don't know.
[06:28.66]Now this is what I'm talking about right here.
[06:31.88]Whichever creature you choose will change according to what he learns and does.
[06:37.72]They all have their own lives, but you need to be a responsible parent and not overfeed them.
[06:43.44]Oh, he's farped and shit.
[06:44.58]Yep, gotta be the cow.
[06:45.94]Cow's the best animal.
[06:47.02]Now it's time to choose.
[06:49.48]He did a look at me.
[06:50.26]I thought you'd know he's perfect.
[06:51.67]The action button to highlight him.
[06:54.09]That might be a little loud.
[06:54.83]Let me turn it down.
[06:55.79]It's a little too loud, isn't it?
[06:58.93]Alright, so... Hold on.
[07:00.37]It's a little loud.
[07:02.05]Yeah, it's maxed out.
[07:05.26]Let's go like... Bring it down a tad.
[07:08.40]Okay.
[07:10.94]Yes.
[07:12.48]Alright, that's... Alright, let's give them all a chance, but we already know what our vote is.
[07:23.47]What's wrong with this one?
[07:24.45]Why was this one just, like, sad?
[07:26.21]Oh, look!
[07:27.19]Wait!
[07:27.57]Is he gonna pick me?
[07:30.59]Remember me from last game?
[07:34.09]I was so funny!
[07:35.53]Oh, he looks unsure!
[07:36.51]I have never been so sure of anything in my whole life.
[07:40.57]Oh, great choice, boss!
[07:55.90]That was awesome.
[07:57.50]Everyone's pretty so sad.
[08:00.32]So it's a baby.
[08:00.97]What?
[08:01.17]What was that?
[08:14.27]You know, let's just do it.
[08:15.53]Use the action button on this scroll to find out how to move and look around.
[08:20.10]I think it's different, because I can't... Click the action button on this scroll to skip tutorials.
[08:25.36]You'll miss out on tribute if you skip it, though.
[08:27.86]Yeah, it's different.
[08:29.06]There's like this different shit here.
[08:30.12]Yeah, I'm gonna do it.
[08:32.03]It's different than the last one.
[08:32.95]The hand is your tool for manipulating the world.
[08:36.21]It's not just drag.
[08:37.13]The movement button pans your view around the world.
[08:41.33]Like this.
[08:42.72]And why are you so frame ready when you do it?
[08:44.61]Yeah, sorry.
[08:45.77]So it's right click this time.
[08:47.05]Wait, what?
[08:47.33]Hold right.
[08:47.81]Okay, I was going to say that didn't work.
[09:01.50]Great work.
[09:02.80]Now we must move to our right.
[09:04.92]To move right, hold down the movement button, then drag the mouse to the left.
[09:10.14]Bad PC.
[09:11.96]Wonderful.
[09:13.42]Just follow the arrows.
[09:14.93]It's a lot better looking than Black and White 1, for sure.
[09:20.57]One hop this time?
[09:22.63]One hop this time.
[09:24.93]Two hops this time.
[09:26.17]That's pretty good.
[09:29.65]I don't have a bad PC.
[09:30.91]You have a bad PC!
[09:32.51]I've got... Excuse me, hold on just a second.
[09:36.07]Wait, there were a couple of winks that came in.
[09:39.97]What do you think about fucking Boomer Brace 2.0?
[09:42.89]This has got fucking titanium in the middle.
[09:44.56]There's steel in here.
[09:58.33]What do you think about Boomer Brace fucking 2.0, guy?
[09:59.75]I think it's pretty good.
[10:03.91]Oh yeah, I'm supposed to... He's bulletproof.
[10:12.58]He's bulletproof.
[10:16.38]I'm super villain.
[10:18.52]I'm no.
[10:19.00]That's what I'm doing.
[10:25.76]Isn't that... That's what I'm doing.
[10:27.68]Game.
[10:27.90]Hold.
[10:29.00]Pull.
[10:29.28]That's what I'm doing.
[10:30.10]Hold.
[10:32.67]Pull.
[10:34.07]Hold.
[10:34.47]Pull.
[10:35.31]Hold.
[10:35.59]Right click.
[10:36.03]Pull.
[10:36.73]What?
[10:37.09]Why is this a little... It's kind of finicky.
[10:39.15]Now... Why is it working now?
[10:41.25]Weird.
[10:41.97]Mindfuck.
[10:42.47]Whatever.
[10:42.81]Alright.
[10:44.09]Pan.
[10:44.35]Yep.
[10:44.65]That's working fine now.
[10:55.31]I love that run.
[10:56.07]Look at his legs.
[11:04.47]Evil Jerma.
[11:05.33]Whatever.
[11:06.25]I know this looks like an evil villain origin story.
[11:09.21]It's gonna keep going until I have... my whole head is made out of metal.
[11:15.55]Now we shall learn to rotate your view.
[11:19.01]Hold the middle mouse button down, then drag from side to side to rotate your view.
[11:26.93]Yeah.
[11:27.41]Last time it wasn't that.
[11:28.60]No, leader.
[11:30.08]Click and hold in the highlighted area.
[11:32.84]Who cares?
[11:34.20]I'm doing it correct.
[11:36.64]Now, whilst keeping the middle mouse button down, drag the mouse left.
[11:43.10]Hmm.
[11:43.91]It's great to be able to picture a view up and down.
[11:48.23]Middle click on the landscape, then drag the mouse backwards.
[11:52.65]Click and hold the middle mouse button in the highlighted area.
[11:57.29]This is you pan up, pan up and down.
[11:59.07]I was in there.
[11:59.89]You didn't even click in the right spot.
[12:02.71]No, leader.
[12:03.13]Oh, I just want to hug Mirrius.
[12:28.01]What's wrong with Mirias?
[12:29.79]There is one last thing, leader.
[12:32.35]Learning to zoom in and out.
[12:34.83]Now, try and zoom in on the creature.
[12:36.71]He's doing like a depressed dance.
[12:38.51]Roll the mouse wheel backwards to zoom out.
[12:41.09]What?
[12:41.59]What's with the depressed dance?
[12:43.81]Holy shit, that was fast.
[12:44.99]Now try zooming towards the creature.
[12:48.65]Excellent work.
[12:49.43]Wonderful.
[12:50.43]You showed remarkable skill, leader.
[12:53.33]Way to go, boss.
[12:55.07]Sorry I couldn't help, but you know places to be.
[12:58.49]All the controls you've just learned can be used to move around the world.
[13:07.82]Can you please say it, Beater?
[13:11.14]This is a gold scroll.
[13:13.54]These legions fill the story.
[13:19.95]Silver scrolls lead to crisis in the world.
[13:24.51]Mr. Wink?
[13:25.61]Fuck.
[13:27.35]Bronze scrolls are tutorials, which can teach you so much.
[13:31.89]Double click the movement button on the ground there to zoom to it quickly.
[13:40.36]That's actually a really good feature to know.
[13:44.88]That's a good feature to know.
[13:48.43]Move the hand over the rock and hold down the action button to pick it up.
[13:54.11]Once you've got hold of it, release the button.
[13:57.97]So let's move all these rocks out of the circle.
[14:01.20]Was it in the original game?
[14:03.30]I don't remember.
[14:04.00]This is different though.
[14:05.48]Yeah, throwing is different.
[14:07.36]It used to be you had to hold and then let go.
[14:10.20]Now I have to let go.
[14:11.90]Yeah, this is a little different.
[14:13.25]Watch out!
[14:28.58]Look, you have received 1000 tribute and you thoroughly deserve it.
[14:38.73]Tribute is good.
[14:39.53]Another bronze scroll.
[14:41.68]So much to learn and so little time.
[14:48.14]I actually dodged it.
[14:49.04]Nice.
[14:49.18]Hype Train game.
[14:49.62]Hype Train game.
[14:50.34]What's that, a hype train?
[14:51.73]Holy shit.
[15:16.01]Very good.
[15:16.79]Now drop him by a highlighted area.
[15:20.07]Disciple farmer.
[15:22.29]This person is safely working at the farm.
[15:26.26]Disciple breeder.
[15:29.02]Don't look leader.
[15:30.46]The breeders are doing whatever it is such people do.
[15:34.60]What's it look like?
[15:38.80]Disciple builder.
[15:39.92]Builder, breeders, farmers.
[15:42.01]We got a builder.
[15:47.44]You don't need that.
[15:48.80]It's fine.
[15:49.24]What about you?
[15:49.68]Forester.
[15:50.08]Mm-hmm.
[15:51.46]I do.
[15:51.81]Ooh.
[15:51.95]Alright, tutorial over.
[15:52.83]Alright, tutorial done.
[16:16.89]I get it.
[16:17.33]Is there any new information that I need to know that's not in this... That was like a little refresher course.
[16:24.75]Uh-oh.
[16:26.23]This is scrolling my chat.
[16:29.43]Oh, that's not good.
[16:31.99]That's not good at all, actually.
[16:35.19]I might have to... I can't see chat now.
[16:37.81]Uh-oh, hold on.
[16:41.67]Might have to open up a third-party program here to see you guys.
[16:46.58]Might have to open up, what about in another window?
[16:48.36]I'm gonna have to open up on a phone.
[16:52.90]Let's see.
[16:58.23]Okay, yeah, I can do it like this.
[17:00.01]This is fine.
[17:01.03]Alright, we're good.
[17:02.39]I got you in a new window.
[17:03.15]Alright, so let's do, um, what is it?
[17:07.64]Side quest?
[17:13.59]If there is a god up there, and you can hear me, please help me out.
[17:18.25]I'm in dire need.
[17:20.02]My life is in ruins.
[17:22.04]A rock has rolled onto my lovely garden.
[17:24.74]I've been trying to move it, but it's too big and heavy.
[17:28.78]If ever a man needs a god, I'm him.
[17:31.52]Please hear my prayer.
[17:35.59]Who's he to ask us to move a rock for him?
[17:40.43]Let's teach him a lesson.
[17:42.25]No, no, that's wrong.
[17:44.23]A knockdown is like laundry.
[17:46.59]We're nothing without them.
[17:47.95]Alright, you got lucky today.
[17:53.72]You got saved by the laundry.
[17:56.51]Praise be!
[17:57.91]The rock is gone!
[17:59.63]My garden is rockless!
[18:01.91]Marvelous.
[18:02.85]You moved the rock.
[18:04.65]The man is happy, and all is well.
[18:07.41]Oh, is this how it's gonna be, boss?
[18:10.34]When in the hearts of this world's people... You've just received tribute.
[18:18.44]Why is the tree bowing?
[18:19.50]Lovely.
[18:21.38]Oh, okay.
[18:22.54]Nice.
[18:22.82]Alright, so we got some tribute there.
[18:24.60]Let's just keep moving around.
[18:27.65]Need some more side quests.
[18:31.39]It's a lot smoother than the last game, too.
[18:32.79]Wait, is this... Let me guess.
[18:34.53]Is this gonna be throw a rock over here and land it?
[18:40.92]Oh, no.
[18:42.10]The waterfall is blocked.
[18:46.73]What will we do now?
[18:48.69]This is awful.
[18:50.03]Don't worry.
[18:51.31]We'll think of something.
[18:52.75]Oh, what about the animals that built this dam?
[18:55.60]What about the beavers?
[18:56.30]Throwing objects can prove very useful in both defense and attack.
[19:00.50]To throw an object, first pick it up.
[19:03.66]Then, whilst keeping the action button held, move the mouse in the direction you want to throw.
[19:10.41]Release the button when you want to let go of the object and send it flying.
[19:16.67]rock beavers oh oh tough luck oh yeah rock on
[19:46.61]Alright, let's just kind of... Alright, it's either too much or too little.
[20:09.29]What the fuck?
[20:11.69]What the fuck?
[20:16.04]Oh my, okay, come on.
[20:23.37]Yeah, rock on!
[20:27.15]Jesus, what?
[20:32.13]Too bad.
[20:33.15]That's hard.
[20:33.95]That's really hard.
[20:36.75]Well done, leader.
[20:38.15]The blockage has been cleared.
[20:45.81]Try another.
[20:46.63]Nice shooting.
[20:48.29]Oh, fun.
[20:53.66]I'm so excited.
[20:54.76]I can't tell you how excited I am.
[20:57.00]I can't wait for Murius to grow into a full-grown cow.
[21:00.83]And point to the point and go... That's my favorite.
[21:05.11]That's all I care about.
[21:12.73]we could help their friends by moving them so they can be together in the main valley okay isn't that sweet a little lost valley of people you're holding a nomad over here great welcome home nomad is in the right valley
[21:57.03]This is unethical.
[21:58.63]Oh, this is unethical.
[22:02.19]I'm doing like a nice thing.
[22:05.41]I'll show you unethical.
[22:06.56]Would you like to see unethical?
[22:18.54]Next time, walk on your own!
[22:19.82]See?
[22:20.46]I mean, is that unethical, or is... Mean, yeah.
[22:25.86]Why are they punching each other?
[22:28.01]You stink.
[22:28.39]Yeah!
[22:28.77]Here we go.
[22:48.90]We're going to the top of the mountain.
[22:51.91]It's time for Murius.
[22:52.83]This is where Murius has to go do his fucking shaman quest to go get chained lightning.
[22:58.21]Are you sure you wish to leave the land?
[23:01.01]Click again to confirm.
[23:02.57]Alright, we got a little refresher.
[23:13.20]They didn't expect that.
[23:14.92]Splat one, villager.
[23:18.52]Now you've had a taste of your powers, we're ready to visit our mighty Greek capital.
[23:23.61]Yeah, full of people that worship us.
[23:30.45]What?
[23:30.85]Please hear us.
[23:32.23]Can you hear them?
[23:33.77]That's a pure prayer.
[23:36.68]That's weird.
[23:37.06]It sounds like something terrible has happened.
[23:39.14]Worship!
[23:41.52]Oh, mighty one, please heed our call in this hour of need.
[23:46.18]Our armies are crushed.
[23:48.42]What's left of us hides in this city from the brutal Aztecs.
[23:52.86]And now they are at our walls.
[23:55.17]I implore you, please help us.
[23:59.01]Oh, that's a lot of people.
[24:00.37]Wait, what?
[24:01.53]Oh, my.
[24:02.99]That's like 5,000 people.
[24:03.51]They're invading.
[24:10.60]What am I supposed to do?
[24:16.48]Look at the pig.
[24:17.80]The pig just sitting there.
[24:23.83]Save the villagers.
[24:24.69]Save the village from the archers.
[24:26.25]What?
[24:26.67]Okay.
[24:38.21]You've got a villager pot?
[24:39.39]Yes.
[24:40.17]You put him down in the right place.
[24:47.30]Am I just seeing that?
[24:49.20]Do they have a god?
[24:50.14]Are people trapped by the burning buildings?
[24:52.64]Oh my Jesus Christ!
[24:55.38]Oh, those weren't people.
[24:56.16]Okay, it's alright.
[24:56.72]Those weren't people.
[24:57.42]That was just a bowl of pots.
[24:59.22]Those weren't people.
[24:59.80]They were pots.
[25:01.36]That villager is now safe.
[25:03.61]Well done.
[25:10.70]Okay, those are people.
[25:12.24]Those are people.
[25:12.88]That time.
[25:13.98]Those are people.
[25:17.77]Uh-oh.
[25:19.99]And he's huge.
[25:25.91]We just have a baby!
[25:27.45]We can't do anything about this!
[25:30.87]Go get him, Furious!
[25:32.35]I don't know, but we best save as many villagers as we can.
[25:37.90]Get out of here!
[25:45.90]I don't think we even, I think Murius is still like in a crib somewhere.
[25:48.46]Um.
[25:55.27]Oh my god, this is horrible.
[26:09.97]They're just getting fired.
[26:11.77]Wait, I can do that too.
[26:13.35]I've learned.
[26:14.49]Why the hell?
[26:15.59]Were those jumps?
[26:17.23]Here we go.
[26:17.99]Burn.
[26:41.60]Alright, that was a lot.
[26:47.54]Another volcano.
[26:52.44]You can make volcanoes in this game?
[26:54.58]Before you could just like shoot lightning bolts out of your hands and throw fireballs.
[26:58.68]You can make a fucking volcano.
[27:06.81]Murius could just like water plants before.
[27:10.40]We've done all we can here, Vida.
[27:13.44]We have lots of followers and we've escaped from the Aztecs.
[27:17.05]Now we gotta get ourselves powerful and take the fight back to the Aztec scum.
[27:23.15]But first, we'll have to conquer the Norse.
[27:26.83]Or free them to join us, of course.
[27:30.03]But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
[27:32.87]To the Norse land!
[27:33.99]Alright, so the Aztecs just destroyed everybody.
[27:38.96]Okay.
[27:41.81]Let's go.
[27:43.45]Now we've got the story.
[27:52.63]Once they say Murius, they're gonna instantly say, you are now our best friend.
[27:58.80]Look!
[27:59.48]Here are the people we saved!
[28:01.42]They're exiting the portal!
[28:03.55]Yeah!
[28:05.13]These guys made it, but think of how many got toasted!
[28:08.75]Anyway, where are we?
[28:11.55]This looks like an old Greek settlement.
[28:14.69]We can reestablish ourselves here.
[28:17.21]It looks so peaceful here.
[28:19.47]With no Aztecs, it's the perfect place to build up and get more followers.
[28:24.92]There is already a town center, storehouse, and a field which we can use.
[28:30.46]The green ring you see is the extent of your influence.
[28:34.73]You can only do things within this ring.
[28:37.93]You can extend the green influence ring by placing more buildings and having more people.
[28:47.46]When you're ready to learn how to feed your people, click on the gold scroll over the field, leader.
[28:57.10]What's that?
[28:57.90]What did I just do?
[28:58.38]Let me take a look at what we got, what we got working with here.
[29:12.67]Who sleeps like this?
[29:19.14]He's sleeping with one leg in the air crossed over because he's farting so much that he has to sleep in this position.
[29:26.98]He has to sleep in the constant I'm gonna fart position.
[29:37.24]That's unbelievable.
[29:41.49]Still funny.
[29:42.21]Your villagers are going to need food very soon, leader.
[29:46.27]Move your hand over this field, then click and hold the action button to pick up the grain.
[29:51.36]When you've got 200 food in your hand, drop all through it into the storehouse.
[30:03.03]How much do I need?
[30:03.75]Can I hold?
[30:04.13]And it goes... This is so much better than the last one.
[30:05.86]It actually tells me... Zero out of seven.
[30:08.30]Yeah, that's so much better.
[30:08.92]I can actually see who's working here.
[30:30.47]Are you going for it?
[30:31.15]1 out of 7.
[30:31.33]2 out of 7.
[30:31.61]Okay, good.
[30:32.15]Re-establish the village.
[30:33.27]Yes.
[30:43.06]Fill it up.
[30:43.40]I actually knew what this game was supposed to be on like the first one.
[30:48.66]Yeah.
[30:48.84]You can still do that.
[30:49.64]That's good.
[30:50.02]When it gets desperate.
[31:05.49]2,000 tribute.
[31:07.15]Got some wood.
[31:07.71]Do I have any, uh, toppers?
[31:09.03]Mm-hmm.
[31:09.49]One.
[31:09.57]Two.
[31:09.81]Three.

[32:01.03]Oh, I'm trying to drop it in here.
[32:01.97]There's a wink right there.
[32:05.48]It's changing.
[32:11.44]It's changing this next week.
[32:13.32]Click on the gold scroll.
[32:24.45]April?
[32:25.09]No, not April.
[32:26.70]That's like two months from now.
[32:28.06]The statues on your town center represent your town's desires.
[32:34.62]This shows what your people would like to build next.
[32:38.03]Keeping your people happy is important and they will let you know if they desire a building type.
[32:45.75]See how the statue is carrying grain?
[32:47.91]That represents the people's desires for food.
[32:52.04]If they need ore or wood, they will let you know.
[32:55.46]Keep an eye on the statue, as it will change.
[33:00.19]Why is he wearing a backpack?
[33:00.87]He's wearing a fuckin' backpack.
[33:01.67]Flame or a fountain?
[33:02.43]Okay.
[33:29.20]this scroll shows the impressiveness of your city its population and happiness there is plenty of other useful information about your growing metropolis refer to it often so that's the need that's how evil I am over the statues and leave it there to get more detail
[33:53.14]So right now, we're doing great.
[33:55.51]Ohms.
[33:56.75]Oh, this is so much better.
[33:58.45]Oh my god, it's so much better.
[34:01.85]Look at that.
[34:03.07]It's... Wow.
[34:04.57]What an improvement from the last game.
[34:06.47]Alright, why am I evil?
[34:08.07]I didn't even do anything.
[34:10.23]I'm 0.1% evil.
[34:12.04]How?
[34:13.30]I didn't do shit.
[34:19.64]Alright, let's keep going.
[34:28.00]Your people desire houses.
[34:30.44]Move your hand over the rotating building, then click and hold the action button to drag it off.
[34:36.41]Wait, what?
[34:36.81]We'll need the right buildings and food if we're gonna support a powerful army.
[34:41.34]So, hold on.
[34:43.04]This is how you make buildings now?
[34:46.25]Click the action button again to place it down.
[34:49.25]Alright, we gotta, we gotta put, I gotta do this right, because this is the first, like, actual mission.
[34:53.76]Let's go back here.
[34:56.14]That's right.
[34:57.20]Keep going.
[34:58.22]We can speed it up by picking up a tree and dropping it on the building.
[35:06.93]See the pile of wood there?
[35:08.69]Your villagers will use that to build the house with.
[35:13.71]I lost the tutorial?
[35:14.67]No, this is the real game.
[35:15.81]The tutorial, we were on Tutorial Island.
[35:19.33]Now, how much do you need?
[35:21.19]320 wood, what do I have here?
[35:24.57]609 wood, what the fuck?
[35:27.94]I need a builder, right?
[35:28.78]Come here.
[35:34.16]You.
[35:34.54]Builder.
[35:38.04]He's gonna corrupt the save again.
[35:39.72]What?
[35:46.75]Place 11 foundations.
[35:49.64]Are you serious?
[35:52.68]Hold on, I gotta place 11 houses?
[35:56.74]That's a lot of houses.
[36:05.91]How much wood do I need?
[36:13.15]Subtitles are riot.
[36:15.25]What do you need subtitles for?
[36:16.48]How do I rotate?
[36:17.10]Is there like an altar?
[36:19.84]How do I rotate?
[36:20.82]R?
[36:21.90]Middle mouse?
[36:23.58]Right mouse?
[36:24.40]How do I rotate?
[36:31.29]I can't rotate.
[36:32.63]Tell me how to rotate.
[36:35.31]Tell me how to rotate.
[36:42.54]Oh, okay, good.
[36:46.40]You can also drag a building blueprint of an existing house.
[36:50.54]Really?
[36:50.98]Move your hand over the existing house.
[36:53.72]Hold down the action button and drag to get the blueprint.
[36:57.42]What?
[36:57.92]That's awesome.
[36:58.36]If you want to cancel an action and empty your hand, simply shake it briskly left and right.
[37:13.16]We need to have... These lots have to be good.
[37:18.70]Fush up!
[37:20.50]Shut up.
[37:21.46]That's not even accurate.
[37:23.50]Why did you say that?
[37:24.84]I'm... I'm... I can't... Why?
[37:29.61]You can also help to build buildings yourself.
[37:32.46]This is God Building.
[37:35.04]Yes, you do it by picking up resources the building needs.
[37:39.30]Then hold your hand over the building and press and hold the action button.
[37:44.32]This is very useful, but you do lose some of the resource in the process.
[37:50.01]So wait, I can build?
[37:50.95]Yeah, you drop them down by a house?
[37:53.97]Hold the action button?
[37:55.91]Okay, hold on.
[37:56.61]Why am I using Reiki to try to build a house?
[37:59.43]That's not how this works.
[38:00.27]What do I have to do?
[38:01.36]With a tree in my hand.
[38:20.88]I need, uh, four more foundations.
[38:30.13]Wait, these are facing the wrong way?
[38:31.19]Okay.
[38:37.48]Well, alright, we're gonna expand this way anyways.
[38:46.44]go over here bang we'll have like the one community one community three more foundations you need to create a disciple builder let's go like that
[39:12.78]This town sucks.
[39:15.18]This wasn't even in the last game.
[39:23.96]This will be the expensive house that's back here.
[39:26.52]You need to create a disciple builder.
[39:28.90]I know.
[39:29.26]Hold on.
[39:37.89]Excellent.
[39:38.93]We've got a nice little troop of builders.
[39:42.21]Can I get rid of this sign?
[39:44.47]It's blocking me.
[39:45.13]What?
[39:46.07]If you lay out roads... How do I lay out a road?
[40:11.96]I didn't do that part yet.
[40:12.80]That's not in the tutorial.
[40:14.55]Drag from the road.
[40:28.55]Oh, shit.
[40:29.59]You can make roads in this one.
[40:31.19]Okay, so we have to... Um, alright.
[40:42.95]Should I go from here and just like this?
[40:49.31]No, this is a bad road.
[40:50.43]It's not right.
[40:50.97]It's not right.
[40:52.59]Building snap to the roads.
[40:54.57]Oh, fuck.
[40:55.11]So this is wrong.
[41:01.30]Oh, this is really bad because now these will never be on a road unless I go in the middle here.
[41:04.96]Alright, here we go.
[41:05.48]Ready?
[41:13.12]Can I move the houses?
[41:17.61]No, no, no, that's making another house.
[41:52.85]I didn't know this was possible.
[41:54.65]Come on, give me a break.
[41:57.13]That's alright.
[41:57.53]It's okay.
[41:58.13]Whatever.
[41:58.39]It's the first level.
[41:59.17]Who cares?
[42:02.65]This is the problem, though.
[42:03.63]Alright, so we need to go from here to here.
[42:04.94]I can't go like this.
[42:29.80]But some roads are like this.
[42:31.78]What am I supposed to do?
[42:33.66]Delete them all?
[42:45.31]Yes, it was done with a crayon by a five-year-old, but I didn't know you could even do this shit.
[42:51.88]That's fine.
[42:52.38]It's fine.
[42:52.98]It's fine.
[42:53.34]It works.
[42:56.89]Alright, let's connect these.
[42:58.39]We need to construct five villas.
[43:00.03]Hold on.
[43:01.69]Let's go out to here.
[43:04.51]And then we're gonna... Fuck, this is so wrong.
[43:06.87]If I had known that roads existed, I would have done this differently.
[43:09.59]Alright, we're just gonna... Fuck it, it's the first level.
[43:12.46]Ooh!
[43:21.72]It's the first level.
[43:22.58]It doesn't matter.
[43:25.34]Alright, now I need to make five villas.
[43:27.30]I have enough builders, right?
[43:31.70]What do people need?
[43:32.56]Free time.
[43:38.87]Throw a villager.
[43:39.77]No, I'm not throwing a villager right now.
[43:41.75]What is this?
[43:47.67]Did you know, with a villager in hand, keep the hand still to get detailed information about the person you're holding.
[43:54.57]I need to make villas.
[43:58.00]I was too busy looking at the roads.
[43:59.51]What do I have to do for a villa?
[44:04.65]Adult population, 34.
[44:06.29]We need some... We have a high birth rate.
[44:08.79]Oh, that's a... House is a villain.

[45:04.71]They want free time?
[45:05.55]No, breeding... No, they want free time, they want to breed, and they want to sleep.
[45:09.03]Well, I just built the houses, so...
[45:26.08]forever sex It's sort of Alright now We're gonna get some reading here.
[45:35.00]What we need to do is increase our population Now we've got some breeders.
[45:40.20]It should be easy to get 75 villages Increase population by 41.
[45:45.48]Alright.

[46:29.24]Depressed.
[46:29.84]Health.
[46:30.10]100.
[46:30.12]Greek.
[46:30.28]Okay, well, whatever.
[46:33.28]Minus 0.84.
[46:34.62]Toolbar.
[46:38.36]Okay, that's kind of in a weird spot.
[46:39.64]It's like all the way down here.
[46:53.94]There's gotta be a hotkey for this, right?
[46:56.92]There's gotta be a hotbar for this.
[46:57.88]F1?
[46:57.92]Oh yeah, that's much better.
[47:08.87]So this is awesome.
[47:09.57]So much easier.
[47:10.19]Construction.
[47:10.63]Education.
[47:11.07]Advanced, boys and girls.
[47:12.19]Tribute menu.
[47:13.07]F4.
[47:37.23]This is the coolest part of the menu.
[47:39.91]The tribute is like a form of currency.
[47:42.65]You can spend it on whatever you like, including new buildings.
[47:47.15]You can improve your godly powers and add constructions or features to your town.
[47:52.95]You earn tribute by finishing challenges and doing other impressive things.
[47:58.67]We have plenty of tribute at the moment, enough to buy a temple.
[48:05.58]Uh, so the faithful will flock to this edifice erected in your glory.
[48:10.22]Their earnest worship will be amplified in this holy place.
[48:13.60]And not only will you people be happier, but your entire town will be much more enhanced in impressiveness.
[48:18.52]Okay, let's get it.
[48:24.87]You can now build a temple.
[48:27.19]This is a good thing, with a capital G. Your town's impressiveness will increase.
[48:34.15]Select the temple from the construction menu, then place it down in your town.
[48:39.38]Torture pit.
[48:41.12]But why would I... I'm like afraid to do that.
[48:43.30]Alright.
[48:44.92]Oh, this is huge.
[48:45.86]Alright, we're gonna put this...
[48:48.36]Mmm, that's not a bad spot for it.
[48:50.50]Or should we have this for... This is like our real estate community.
[48:53.70]And this would be our business section over here.
[48:55.74]Right?
[48:55.96]Like down here?
[48:56.68]Or... No, these are gonna be houses.
[48:59.30]Over here.
[49:04.38]I think like right... Right here.
[49:06.69]No, it's gonna be connected to a road.
[49:08.47]Behind here.
[49:10.63]The torture pit's gonna go down here, so it's alright.
[49:15.97]I'm thinking like... Like right here.
[49:20.04]Select the temple from the construction menu.
[49:23.16]Then place it down in your town.
[49:26.43]Some buildings require ore to be built.
[49:29.29]There are two sources of ore.
[49:31.69]The first is the ore mine.
[49:34.71]An ore deposit in the ground that can be mined by your villagers.
[49:38.93]There are also ore rocks.
[49:41.69]The villagers can mine these, but at the same time, you can add them to your storehouse yourself.
[49:47.11]Oh, I can just pick up the ore.
[49:48.67]So they can't do this.
[49:50.81]I can do this.
[49:53.41]Here we go.
[49:54.25]Ore is where?
[49:54.73]Over here?
[49:56.04]Boom.
[49:57.26]Ah!
[49:57.74]Boom.
[50:00.22]I gotta be careful I don't hit anybody with this.
[50:01.48]I don't want to hit anybody with this.
[50:05.42]Let's just pick them all up, get it over with, and done.
[50:08.15]And then conquer whatever we need to conquer.
[50:11.25]Oh wait, 22?
[50:11.95]Alright, temple.
[50:12.79]Temple's not built yet.
[50:14.59]It's time for the torture pit.
[50:18.29]No, I'm not a fucking monster.
[50:20.31]That's not the second building I'm going to build.
[50:27.62]What?
[50:27.96]Oh, right.
[50:28.82]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[50:29.66]Okay, I got it.
[50:30.00]I got it.
[50:30.46]I got it.
[50:30.92]I got it.
[50:52.23]Builder.
[50:53.21]You.
[50:54.55]Who are you?
[50:56.33]You build.
[50:58.56]I'll help.
[51:04.52]You coming over here too?
[51:05.44]You gonna help build?
[51:09.40]No.
[51:09.72]Why are you just following this person?
[51:10.82]Okay.
[51:14.68]I've run out of trees.
[51:22.64]They need to breed.
[51:24.36]My population's doing fine.
[51:26.31]15, 14.
[51:26.37]We're almost done.
[51:35.71]Uh, is that it?
[51:37.49]Why am I holding, like, a dead tree?
[51:42.35]Oh, it thinks I'm outside of the ring.
[51:45.53]Wait, what?
[51:46.39]What are you talking about?
[51:54.34]I'm inside the ring.
[51:59.14]Oh, it needs ore.
[51:59.96]Oh, okay.
[52:04.04]Oh, come here.
[52:07.18]1,200 ore.
[52:07.66]1,000 ore.
[52:08.48]What?
[52:09.64]Come on.
[52:09.84]Is this ore?
[52:13.62]What are you doing?
[52:28.61]300 ore.
[52:29.19]Almost there.
[52:30.31]Where's the cow?
[52:31.88]Resting.
[52:33.06]Because the cow is not doing... The cow can't do anything yet.
[52:37.20]Look, we'll check in.
[52:39.10]Still sleeping.
[52:39.82]It's been like seven days.
[52:47.03]What a lazy bastard.
[52:48.41]No, it's a baby!
[52:50.51]And plus, wait, it's a cow!
[53:00.92]It's a, it's a, it's a she.
[53:04.20]It's a cow.
[53:12.12]Cow.
[53:12.70]It's a cow.
[53:22.85]No.
[53:34.32]How do people get so many channel points?
[53:35.48]If you subscribe, you get double.
[53:38.76]Alright, we got the temple now.
[53:40.12]We're very impressive.
[53:41.12]Oops, I just dropped a... I just dropped a rock on it.
[53:44.77]I just smashed a window accidentally.
[53:46.83]Is it okay?
[53:47.57]Alright.
[53:51.35]Impressiveness went up.
[53:54.39]If you build a very impressive city, then people will come from far and wide to live in it.
[54:01.93]Civic buildings are a good way to increase impressiveness.
[54:06.01]Nobody gets hurt and we get more followers, making us more powerful.
[54:13.12]Why'd you build the temple on an incline?
[54:14.34]Oh, here they come.
[54:14.88]Come on, viewer readers, it's time to do something.
[54:17.70]Here they come.
[54:18.82]They're coming because they want to see the impressive city.
[54:41.96]Come on over.
[54:43.48]Take a look.
[54:44.54]Have you seen the cow?
[54:47.94]Take a look at the cow.
[54:48.98]Alright, Murius, it's time to do some work.
[54:51.52]You gotta go make people laugh and stuff.
[54:58.96]Let's not disturb him.
[55:03.62]I can't even wait.
[55:06.80]Alright, I'm just waiting for them to come in.
[55:08.56]Alright.
[55:13.95]Who's this?
[55:16.93]What are these people doing?
[55:17.59]Why are they... They have like swords?
[55:20.87]Where are they going?
[55:29.06]I can't grab them.
[55:32.02]This is an RTS.
[55:33.32]This person has patrols.
[55:34.54]Okay.
[55:34.74]Hi, guys.
[55:45.16]Alright, are they almost here?
[55:46.44]Let's welcome them.
[55:49.56]Let's welcome them by immediately grabbing the person with the flag and throwing them as far as we can.
[55:58.52]I don't like that, though.
[55:59.22]They're gonna come over here and kill us.
[56:00.62]Alright, anybody?
[56:03.71]Who's at the temple?
[56:04.29]Anybody?
[56:05.63]No worshippers?
[56:09.05]Here, use it.
[56:10.91]Worship at that building.
[56:15.10]Here they come.
[56:18.78]These people have come to join our town.
[56:21.80]Pick up their migration flag and drop it anywhere within our influence ring.
[56:28.39]Wait, they have a migration flag?
[56:30.13]Okay.
[56:30.23]18,000.
[56:31.15]Torture pit, torture pit, torture pit.
[56:35.67]Oh, God.
[56:36.03]Alright, hold on.
[56:46.50]Look at how many people are here now.
[56:47.44]This is Breeder.
[56:49.10]This is... Wait, before anybody does anything.
[56:58.17]Let's get some more people.
[57:00.17]I need some workers.
[57:02.49]Alright, let's go.
[57:03.25]How many people are in this field?
[57:05.45]Zero to 17.
[57:06.47]Hold on.
[57:06.73]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[57:08.99]Guys, guys, guys, guys.
[57:09.93]I know you just came in, but here.
[57:11.33]Let's go.
[57:16.99]I need more um I need more buildings okay wait breeder we want a breeder again we want armor what are the needs I'm looking I'm a good guy 4.9 good on the gold scroll
[57:45.13]Armouries are where you can turn your people into warriors.
[57:49.69]Warriors who can take other towns and lands by force.
[57:54.31]Buying the armory is the first step towards having an army.
[57:58.99]Open the toolbar and click the tribute tab.
[58:04.32]Pah, temple.
[58:06.04]Why build that when you can build an armory?
[58:11.22]Why build the temple when you can build an armory?
[58:16.27]It's Bernie.
[58:17.61]It's just, every voice is Bernie, isn't it?
[58:22.13]Recruit powerful armies made up of strong, brave swordsmen, almost scarily eager to do battle in your name against your enemies.
[58:29.11]Let's get it.
[58:31.65]Select the armory from the construction menu, then place it down in your town.
[58:37.27]Alright, where should I put this?
[58:41.22]How about over here?
[58:45.19]Where's the nearest town?
[58:47.83]I want it down here.
[58:48.53]Somewhere like over here on the edge.
[58:54.11]Where's the entrance?
[58:55.53]Right there?
[58:56.43]Okay, so we're going to go like this.
[58:57.45]We're going to have a road eventually connect here.
[58:58.89]Right there.
[59:03.45]Let's get some roads.
[59:07.24]How about like this?
[59:08.34]Split around the farm.
[59:10.08]That looks nice.
[59:10.84]Oh, that looks nice.
[59:15.05]Oh, this way over here.
[59:17.61]Oh look, that looks nice!
[59:21.91]Then from here we're gonna go this way.
[59:31.19]God sucks at design.
[59:32.59]Why am I evil for doing this?
[59:36.56]Oh, because I'm building an evil building.
[59:38.96]I get it.
[59:41.82]It's an evil building.
[59:57.25]go evil how much what does it need 810 wood 500 ore uneven it doesn't need to be even murius when are you gonna wake up I want to play fun games with you like kick the tree do you ever kick the tree you love that game murius
[60:28.44]Alright, let's get some ore.
[60:33.37]No, that's not right.
[60:35.25]The green ring you see is the extent of your influence.
[60:41.11]Oh, shit.
[60:41.63]Okay, I need miners.
[60:42.81]How much ore do I have?
[60:47.83]How much ore do I have?
[60:48.49]Let me go to my stockpile.
[60:50.49]I got a lot.
[60:51.21]How much do I get?
[60:52.54]I'm full on wood?
[60:54.12]Wait.
[60:58.30]Okay, that's good.
[60:58.88]Sheesh, the people can be slow at building, boys.
[61:03.86]We should do some guy building.
[61:05.44]You know, three words.
[61:07.18]Speed it up.
[61:08.38]That is sweet.
[61:11.18]Warriors for platoons.
[61:13.35]They're recruited via the flags on the top of the armory.
[61:16.61]Pick up one of the flags on the armory, then place it in the highlighted area.
[61:22.52]So I have to make war?
[61:24.04]Like, platoons?
[61:26.40]Number of troops, number of melee.
[61:28.42]It's melee.
[61:29.42]God, I know how to say that word.
[61:37.45]Oh shit, okay.
[61:43.27]You can make a huge army so you can just drag this gigantic area of like a- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[61:52.04]Why are you coming over here?
[61:52.78]I didn't tell you to come over here.
[61:55.48]Wait, too many people want to be warriors.
[61:57.82]Wait.
[61:59.08]Don't I have to tell you to be a warrior?
[62:00.91]Alright.
[62:01.65]Are you sure you guys don't want to be farmers?
[62:08.68]Oh, God.
[62:09.66]Okay, um... I can't click and... Where are they going?
[62:19.73]All armies are the best thing ever, but you're gonna need to keep them under control.
[62:25.02]So you need to know all about these here flags.
[62:29.04]Every platoon has a flag.
[62:31.14]You can see it held up high above the army and also in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.
[62:37.21]Each platoon type has a different color and symbol on their flag to make them easy to identify.
[62:43.85]this one is a swordsman platoon the flags also tell you what rank the platoon is those pips along the top indicate the rank from raw recruits to seasoned veterans if you click on the flags in the bottom right with the action button you pick up the flag and gain control of the platoon click on the flag with the move button and you'll go directly to the platoon and there you have it the basics of army flags
[63:13.30]Pick up the platoon flag, boss.
[63:15.86]Pick up the platoon flag.
[63:17.62]Health 100.
[63:17.88]20 out of 20.
[63:18.50]That's kind of in a weird spot.
[63:23.89]Come on.
[63:24.35]Come here.
[63:27.41]Let's go.
[63:28.43]That's perfect.
[63:30.11]Click on the highlighted area to tell them to go there.
[63:33.61]If you want to cancel an action and empty your hand, simply shake it briskly left and right.
[63:39.11]So I don't have to have influence over here.
[63:41.65]That's kind of a big deal.
[63:52.08]I don't have to have influence?
[63:56.30]So I can just make a ton of people and just go conquer towns.
[63:59.50]They just go where I can't.
[64:00.65]That's so awesome.
[64:03.93]Actually having control over what they do.
[64:05.55]Because remember last time it was... If you were outside, it was like I had to throw people to gain access to be able... It was... That's a much needed change.
[64:20.92]I had to throw that one unkillable guy around the map.
[64:22.68]Do I want to do this by force?
[64:23.36]I guess it's just teaching me how this works.
[64:25.56]Alright, where are we going?
[64:27.23]Didn't these people all just come over willingly?
[64:49.98]Everyone just came over here.
[64:50.94]This is an empty town.
[64:55.82]Are they coming?
[65:07.29]Raise it to the ground.
[65:08.63]There's nothing to raise.
[65:09.53]It's just a few houses and a temple.
[65:17.09]An army marches on its stomach, and these guys will eat twice the normal rate.
[65:22.01]So keep an eye out on your stores.
[65:25.29]They eat twice the food?
[65:26.47]Oh god, here they come.
[65:31.78]How do I put the flag down?
[65:40.64]Like that, okay.
[65:44.04]Alright, guys.
[65:44.54]Do what you do.
[65:46.22]Diplomacy.
[65:47.10]First.
[65:48.09]Always.
[65:48.45]Uh... Well, we're already doing this.
[65:50.39]Take over town by impressing... What?
[65:52.31]Impressing the stones?
[66:17.36]Impress them with how many soldiers you have.
[66:19.14]I mean, that works, I guess.
[66:27.78]How we doing?
[66:28.73]Do we need anything?
[66:33.21]Homes.
[66:35.55]We need some houses.
[66:36.35]We need some houses.
[66:38.09]We need some villa.
[66:46.95]I know this is terrible.
[66:47.93]It sucks, but who cares?
[66:48.85]We're going to do two more.
[66:52.35]I know it's terrible.
[66:53.43]I know.
[66:53.75]Trust me.
[66:54.61]I'm the one making it.
[66:55.25]You don't think I know it's horrible?
[66:57.71]We'll do like three more houses.
[67:04.59]Alright, that's fine.
[67:06.75]Did they get it?
[67:19.17]Dermot the bomb.
[67:20.05]Dermot, he has earpods in.
[67:22.63]Oh shit, I can't hear you.
[67:27.25]So what, do I just gain influence?
[67:29.05]I can't hear it.
[67:35.31]Impressiveness required to capture.
[67:36.93]There's 19 people still here.
[67:41.24]That's weird.
[67:45.74]Oh.
[67:48.14]And... did we get it?
[67:49.56]We got it.
[67:52.82]Hooray.
[67:53.70]Now where are they going?
[67:55.95]What do they need?
[67:56.79]Wood.
[68:12.46]the newly created platoon starts at experience level one unless they fight they gain experience when the platoon's experience reaches a certain threshold they go up to the next experience level and with it their skills such as fighting and speed improve lastly if you want to disband the platoon drop the platoon's flag onto an armory and let those weaklings off the hook
[68:40.16]Oh that okay, so they can go back to being regular, okay You see you can win by taking over towns using force or by impressing the people in those other towns.
[68:53.08]Need a builder over here.
[68:53.88]War solves everything.
[68:55.70]How many of you guys are farmers?
[68:56.84]Build.
[68:57.40]You can win by a mixture of impressing and war.
[69:00.97]What about breeders?
[69:02.21]Go to some wood.
[69:03.19]Mhm.
[69:03.39]Time to choose!
[69:04.41]Take over every town on the land.
[69:06.57]Oh shit, I gotta take these two over.
[69:34.42]Be good.
[69:34.88]Be evil.
[69:35.36]Be good.
[69:35.72]Be evil.
[69:36.22]Be evil.
[69:38.23]Um... Well, hold on.
[69:42.85]Oh, it's time to awaken?
[69:46.05]It's time to... But not yet.
[69:47.11]Not yet.
[69:47.43]Not yet.
[69:48.13]Let's let the fucking hype build a little more.
[69:51.69]F2?
[69:51.75]F1?
[69:51.79]What is it?
[69:52.13]It's not F2.
[69:52.67]What is it?
[70:05.79]Objectives tab?
[70:08.63]Right.
[70:09.35]Here you can find all the important tasks that will enable you to complete a land.
[70:14.31]And also some less important tasks that are just interesting to do.
[70:18.17]We're almost there.
[70:18.79]The tabs at the bottom right control which objectives you are looking at.
[70:22.61]Oh, that's cool.
[70:23.17]Either all of them or a selection from the total.
[70:26.11]The objectives window up in the top left also displays the objectives.
[70:30.97]you only need to complete the gold scroll objective to complete the land okay but you learn more tribute by undertaking some of the other ones yeah yes you earn tribute for every objective you complete oh this side quest scroll I'm not clicking on no I don't want to do that yet I just like this all this stuff alright that's good to know
[70:53.87]As our city grows, the greater the distance our villages will have to travel.
[70:58.87]To aid their little feat, we can build roads.
[71:02.63]To build a road, grab an existing road by holding down the action button.
[71:08.29]Then, drag out the shape of the road you want.
[71:11.35]When you're happy with it, click the action button.
[71:14.78]So you gotta build roads first.
[71:16.82]And then you block out the town.
[71:18.72]Yeah, okay.
[71:20.74]I need to have... We'll just have this connected here because it's tutorial.
[71:31.16]Whatever.
[71:31.38]Doesn't even care.
[71:38.33]Doesn't matter.
[71:40.01]I had to do that just to get... Oh, that looks really bad.
[71:44.18]From a satellite, that looks really bad.
[71:47.26]It doesn't matter.
[71:47.74]This is level one.
[71:48.70]We'll block up the next complete village.
[71:50.42]We haven't even, like, woken up the creature yet, so we're good.
[71:54.93]Alright, what's this side quest?
[71:57.45]What did I just do?
[72:02.12]Drunk City Builder.
[72:07.54]Hey you, Greek god, if you exist, I know you can hear me.
[72:12.15]My daughter's fallen pregnant.
[72:14.51]She says no man has touched her.
[72:16.61]It's an immaculate conception.
[72:18.71]So it must be down to you.
[72:20.87]You are responsible for the child.
[72:23.27]Pay me a dowry of 1,000 wood.
[72:29.96]I have no idea how this happened.
[72:31.30]You dirty dog.
[72:34.05]How does she get pregnant?
[72:35.27]She's having sex to my left!
[72:36.29]That was ridiculous.
[72:37.11]Where is she going?
[72:37.75]Something is amiss?
[73:06.40]What are we doing?
[73:11.04]Clean up those ants.
[73:11.80]There's bugs everywhere.
[73:13.66]Who left out like a can of food?
[73:14.96]Come on.
[73:31.71]I don't know.
[73:32.01]I don't know if that was scripted enough or if that was fucking funny.
[73:35.68]Who's playing the automaton?
[73:40.66]Alright, how... Watch out, the person has an axe!
[73:48.55]No, I'm busy.
[73:55.49]New follow quest.
[73:56.51]I don't care if this is two hours.
[73:57.57]At least I don't have to be behind her.
[74:07.35]Where are you going?
[74:08.73]All the way?
[74:09.19]Are you walking all the way to one of these houses?
[74:11.62]Okay.
[74:11.90]Oh my god.
[74:27.53]What?
[74:38.78]She's going right over here.
[74:47.32]Why do I feel like one of these random townspeople is going to just throw something at her or attack her or something?
[74:51.93]They keep walking over here menacingly.
[74:55.47]Where are you going?
[74:56.17]I don't know why there's so many bugs.
[75:01.47]I don't know.
[75:02.03]Here we go.
[75:08.18]It's because the houses were so far away.
[75:10.76]This is a whole other community.
[75:12.16]She had to walk across the whole town.
[75:15.68]Pregnant.
[75:18.58]This is like, scale it back, this is like probably ten miles.
[75:24.58]This is like at least four to five miles.
[75:26.44]It's scaled.
[75:30.94]Okay.
[75:32.26]So now what?
[75:35.17]Is she gonna be like, you're the dad or something?
[75:44.79]I don't understand.
[75:47.08]Hold on.
[75:47.84]She's pregnant.
[76:08.63]How is she okay?
[76:09.67]She's having she's having sex Wow like nine months pregnant?

[76:48.16]Uh, hey.
[76:51.27]I got something for you.
[76:52.73]You?
[76:54.11]Hello?
[76:54.41]Can I talk to you?
[76:57.85]Uh... I was gonna bring you over here.
[77:15.50]No, come here!
[77:15.94]That took too long?
[77:16.58]What?
[77:16.76]No, it didn't.
[77:17.18]He's already gone.
[77:17.86]We have to put him in the chimney.
[77:49.03]She's walking away?
[77:50.27]Oh shit, there she is!
[77:54.00]Alright, hold on, wait, wait.
[78:04.74]No, look!
[78:06.90]It's alright, she'll do it again.
[78:15.68]It's alright, she'll go back.
[78:17.46]It's alright.
[78:21.26]Oh, we need ore.
[78:22.48]How many people are in the mine?
[78:24.84]Zero.
[78:25.36]What?
[78:30.02]Oh, no, no, no.
[78:33.66]You keep doing your thing.
[78:38.92]Alright.
[78:43.00]We'll go back to that quest.
[78:44.68]It's going to happen.
[78:45.28]Just remind me that it's happening, and we'll catch it.
[78:48.39]It's time to awaken Murius.
[78:53.72]And... This was a long sleep, but here we are.
[78:59.92]I'm over here.
[79:25.25]Why are you scared?
[79:26.05]Okay.
[79:26.55]Okay.
[79:26.67]Here we go.
[79:45.52]He's been in the pen for ages.
[79:48.18]Make him come outside for a bit.
[79:50.78]Move him outside by clicking the action button once on the ground.
[79:56.26]Excellent.
[79:57.18]With your creature on the leash, you can move him or get him to do things.
[80:01.94]And more importantly, to do what you want him to do.
[80:04.92]Oh my god.
[80:06.32]Why are you so slow?
[80:09.92]He slept like a hundred years?
[80:11.82]Well...
[80:15.68]Well done.
[80:16.70]That's how you get the creature to move.
[80:19.14]The creature's hungry.
[80:21.00]Let's feed him.
[80:22.94]Okay, what do you want?
[80:24.70]Food?
[80:24.88]Grain?
[80:25.38]With the leech in the hand, click on the field.
[80:29.97]Come get grain.
[80:31.19]Here he comes.
[80:32.45]I'm going to get that grain.
[80:36.43]Yes.
[80:38.03]Eat it.
[80:39.05]It's delicious.
[80:41.50]He ate the entire field?
[80:42.70]Does Elise actually work in this game?
[81:05.75]Should I eat a villager?
[81:07.45]He didn't eat anybody yet.
[81:35.66]He didn't eat anybody.
[81:37.26]He has not eaten this person.
[81:39.32]So, he hasn't done anything wrong.
[81:42.44]You haven't done anything wrong yet.
[81:43.80]Why would I discipline you?
[81:45.24]Just pick somebody up.
[81:47.62]Alright, you're good.
[81:50.92]I'll sometimes choose to eat a villager.
[81:52.64]What do you mean, sometimes?
[81:57.28]Ooh!
[81:58.46]It's sensitive.
[81:59.90]Wait, I'll often choose... No, no, no, no, no.
[82:01.94]Don't often choose to eat a villager.
[82:03.70]Choose...
[82:05.07]How do I... That was horrible.
[82:08.21]Oh my god, I knocked him down.
[82:15.64]What is he doing?
[82:16.36]Oh my god, that's so bad.
[82:19.72]Oh, you're on the road to making a nasty creature.
[82:24.12]What a senseless waste of human life.
[82:26.80]If you want to cancel an action and empty your hand, simply shake it briskly left
[82:32.66]That is just about everything you need to know right now.
[82:36.17]Why don't you try experimenting with your creature?
[82:40.03]Okay, let's experiment.
[82:41.33]What do you think is over here?
[82:42.75]Can you pick this up?
[82:44.37]Try.
[82:45.89]I can't do that.
[82:53.90]I'm going to eat snack on that grain.
[82:55.84]No, stop eating the grain!
[83:00.80]You eat too much grain.
[83:02.70]Oh my god.
[83:04.52]Can you eat bugs?
[83:06.58]Wait, come over here.
[83:07.15]Eat the bugs.
[83:07.99]Can you play with the bugs and eat the bugs or something?
[83:11.97]Wait.
[83:12.65]Pick up this rock.
[83:16.40]I have to teach you.
[83:22.10]Pick up rock.
[83:24.90]Okay.
[83:25.76]Good.
[83:27.10]Very good.
[83:28.74]Do not eat rock.
[83:29.62]He's learning.
[83:30.80]He's getting inquisitive.
[83:35.36]Okay.
[83:36.86]Now you figure out what you want to do with it.
[83:38.46]Okay.
[83:42.80]Put it down.
[83:44.42]Very good.
[83:45.20]Alright.
[83:45.46]What about the... I had enough for today.
[83:56.61]Okay.
[83:57.81]Well, that was a lot for one day.
[83:59.68]This is a rock.
[84:01.34]That's enough for one day.
[84:02.56]Food coma.
[84:03.22]Alright, how we doing?
[84:10.46]People want to sleep.
[84:12.60]Do I not have enough houses?
[84:16.92]So let them sleep.
[84:17.66]Alright, what about the daughter?
[84:22.55]There he is.
[84:25.95]Where is she?
[84:30.97]Just look for the pregnant lady.
[84:33.13]Go on.
[84:35.94]Okay, we missed it.
[84:37.10]We gotta do it again.
[84:41.82]Oh, he's up.
[84:47.32]Where you going?
[84:48.64]I want you to learn.
[84:49.76]I want you to do things.
[84:51.51]I want you to... Why is his stomach so big?
[85:00.46]He's just kind of doing a perimeter.
[85:04.81]Look at how fat the stomach is!
[85:11.52]Is he blowing a kiss?
[85:12.56]He's so wonderful.
[85:16.10]I could enter- I could entertain some villagers.
[85:18.28]Yeah, do that!
[85:20.69]Entertain the villagers.
[85:29.57]How is this entertaining a villager?
[85:31.28]He's, like, smelling him.
[85:36.80]I am going to play with that villager.
[85:40.28]Okay, cool.
[85:44.63]Good work.
[85:48.21]I did it.
[85:48.97]I had fun.
[85:49.55]Bye.
[85:51.27]He just wanted to smell him.
[85:53.58]Bugs, yes.
[85:54.84]Very good.
[86:00.20]Everybody loves him.
[86:03.08]Good job.
[86:04.72]Yeah.
[86:05.24]Very... No!
[86:06.06]I'm trying to pet him!
[86:09.04]Good job.
[86:09.68]Entertain the villagers.
[86:16.09]Alright, let's do... Now we have to take... Alright.
[86:19.39]He'll be fine.
[86:19.93]He's gonna learn.
[86:21.97]I need more houses?
[86:24.99]It's C, right?
[86:26.03]For creature?
[86:26.53]I'm starving.
[86:28.87]Fuck.
[86:29.53]Um...
[86:31.98]How much grain is here?
[86:32.74]Alright, here.
[86:36.60]Wait, wait, wait.
[86:38.93]Take some of this.
[86:42.39]What are you doing over here?
[86:43.43]What are you doing?
[86:50.38]Uh... Where is he... Is he bringing this... Where are you bringing this tree?
[87:10.15]It's so pointless.
[87:11.53]Wait, what are you going to eat this?
[87:13.31]No, no, no, no.
[87:13.83]Eat this instead.
[87:14.92]Eat that instead.
[87:16.68]No, no, no.
[87:17.06]Eat this instead.
[87:17.96]Hey, hey, leash, leash, leash, leash.
[87:19.38]Eat this.
[87:20.84]Eat the grain.
[87:24.06]Eat that.
[87:24.40]No, no, no, no, no.
[87:28.34]Eat this.
[87:31.43]Why did he pick up the tree?
[87:33.67]He picked up the tree and gave the tree as a present to one of the villagers.
[87:38.31]Eat it.
[87:39.73]Eat that.
[87:40.75]Isn't it good?
[87:43.59]Yeah, it is.
[87:46.21]I'm going to... What does it say?
[87:47.27]I'm going to play with that villager.
[87:49.96]Alright.
[87:50.62]What do I do with this tree?
[87:51.78]Oh, somebody already picked it up.
[87:52.62]Okay, good.
[87:55.98]ADHD cow.
[87:58.20]Yeah.
[87:58.66]It's so much fun just to watch him grow.
[88:04.23]We must have played with...
[88:08.40]This person's not interested at all.
[88:10.72]Alright, uh, the pregnant lady.
[88:14.91]Here she goes.
[88:15.35]Alright, we're ready.
[88:17.71]Now I'm gonna, um, hold on.
[88:19.27]What do I need to do?
[88:19.81]I need to build... I need to build something else.
[88:26.15]Where's he going?
[88:27.31]Why is he picking up trees?
[88:29.75]Why is he doing this?
[88:32.36]What's the logic here?
[88:33.14]Is he trying to plant trees?
[88:34.38]Or is he just giving trees to people?
[88:38.32]I'm going... I'm dead?
[88:40.60]What?
[88:40.74]What is he doing?
[88:49.80]That's the wrong store.
[88:54.74]That's not... That's incorrect.
[88:57.22]I know you're trying to help, but... He's locked himself in here.
[89:04.69]That's not correct.
[89:06.17]Alright, you tried though.
[89:07.77]You tried.
[89:08.27]You tried.
[89:12.41]Nice work.
[89:13.97]Thank you for trying.
[89:17.49]He's just a baby.
[89:18.35]He doesn't know.
[89:24.72]He didn't eat anybody.
[89:30.85]Okay.
[89:32.37]Uh, what was I doing?
[89:33.33]I'm too distracted.
[89:35.01]ADHD cow and ADHD streamer.
[89:37.09]This is a horrible, horrible fucking combination.
[89:41.55]Alright, um.
[89:43.21]Alright, alright, alright.
[89:43.85]Lady, lady, lady, lady, lady.
[89:46.29]Come here.
[89:53.06]She there?
[89:53.38]Here she comes.
[90:23.51]Entertain equals eat?
[90:24.79]What?
[90:25.45]Here we go.
[90:30.49]So now what?
[90:30.95]Do I just put him down here and knock on the door?
[90:32.85]I get 20,000 tribute for this.
[90:36.48]Here we go.
[90:38.82]Alright.
[90:54.20]This way, that way, this way, that way.
[90:56.10]That's all I had to do.
[90:56.64]Okay.
[90:56.74]That works.
[91:26.54]That's 20,000 tribute.
[91:29.24]What is he doing?
[91:31.45]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?
[91:35.91]Shall I poo on that villager?
[91:41.41]I don't think so.
[91:43.29]Why?
[91:49.20]Why would you do that?
[91:50.94]Why would you even ask that question?
[91:54.70]Should I?
[91:55.74]I'm going to eat that villager.
[91:57.64]First you're gonna shit on them, but you've decided you're gonna eat them instead.
[92:05.37]That's so rude.
[92:06.11]Okay, he doesn't know.
[92:06.83]He's like fucked up.
[92:09.27]Is he drunk?
[92:15.72]Where you going?
[92:27.74]Gather from the fields?
[92:28.95]Yes.
[92:33.29]Do that, yes.
[92:34.17]Gather from the fields and put it in.
[92:41.87]He can do it all in one go.
[92:43.23]Alright, he's going to put it in the wood pile, isn't he?
[92:47.59]Nope.
[92:48.13]Good.
[92:50.37]What's going on?
[92:53.76]What's going on?
[92:56.46]Why do I hear like a... Are we under attack?
[93:00.84]Alright, go to bed.
[93:15.27]Maybe he'll growl.
[93:15.95]Alright, that's good.
[93:16.79]I need to... Wait a minute.
[93:19.97]I'm just gonna go kill these people.
[93:24.21]What are we doing over here?
[93:24.86]What do we need?
[93:26.71]Sweet.
[93:27.07]Oh, we need some more buildings.
[93:27.87]Oh, is the storeroom built?
[93:30.39]The storeroom's built.
[93:31.17]What are you... You got everyone just, like, kind of standing around.
[93:37.90]Guys, get some shit done.
[93:40.18]Oh, there's too much... Okay, we need wood.
[93:47.00]Come here.
[93:47.76]Pick this up.
[93:59.09]What do we got over here?
[93:59.85]We have... Let me see.
[94:04.15]Stay over here.
[94:04.85]Because... Seriously, if they attack, I want them to be right there.
[94:09.87]I need trees.
[94:17.39]Hold on.
[94:17.77]Let me... Let's build another house.
[94:23.28]Forty... How many people are here now?
[94:25.28]A lot, right?
[94:26.78]Yeah.
[94:27.02]Let's do...
[94:29.26]Just get another house here or whatever.
[94:30.53]I have so much food.
[94:34.73]You know what?
[94:35.07]I'm going to take a bunch of this food.
[94:39.21]I'm going to take like fucking 10,000.
[94:40.61]They're not even eating it.
[94:42.61]I'm bringing it over here.
[94:50.10]That's evil?
[94:50.98]I own the place.
[94:54.78]What is he doing?
[94:58.08]I'm going to have a dump on that villager's head.
[95:04.26]Why do you keep saying this?
[95:08.68]What is wrong with you?
[95:11.12]He never does it, though.
[95:12.71]He always threatens to take a shit on somebody, but he never does.
[95:23.77]Should you poo on somebody?
[95:24.93]Wait, we're getting a new scroll.
[95:29.47]Come with me.
[95:32.61]We're gonna go... I want you over here.
[95:42.02]Can I... Yeah, I want to take you... Take a walk.
[95:45.08]I want you to go impress these people over here.
[95:51.36]You... Go explore.
[95:52.37]Go learn some stuff.
[95:56.91]Who needs homes?
[96:00.10]My chat's all fucked up.
[96:01.16]Hold on a second.
[96:02.32]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[96:05.05]I need to save the goddamn game.
[96:07.15]Holy shit, that would have been a disaster.
[96:08.69]AtmaStarfish, thanks for the five community subs.
[96:12.31]Create a new save.
[96:12.89]Can you imagine two hours going by?
[96:22.36]Take over the time.
[96:23.18]Alright, I'm ready.
[96:25.42]Let's go.
[96:32.32]How are you doing?
[96:37.39]It's nighttime, but... There's no ore over here, though.
[96:40.57]I need to get over... Alright.
[96:44.67]Is it time to have a fight?
[96:45.57]Hold on, I gotta fix my chat.
[96:48.63]Hold on a second.
[96:49.57]It's like, it's all fucked up.
[96:50.73]I can't see what anybody's saying.
[96:53.02]Even in the other window.
[96:53.80]Hold on.
[96:54.74]Okay.
[96:59.36]Yeah, you guys are like...
[97:02.03]I'm full two with three minutes behind me.
[97:07.23]Alright.
[97:07.55]How do I just make it so the scroll doesn't happen?
[97:13.84]I can't, like, lock this.
[97:17.48]Is there a way to remove the ability to scroll on, like, chat window on Twitch?
[97:22.98]Because it doesn't matter what I do.
[97:23.88]I have to go get, like, a... I have to go get, like, my iPad or something.
[97:29.01]Don't tell him.
[97:29.75]No, tell me.
[97:31.43]Remove the mouse wheel.
[97:33.08]I don't think anything.
[97:33.94]Can I lock it?
[97:36.40]Make it so the program takes exclusive rights to the cursor.
[97:38.70]I don't even know how the fuck to even do that.
[97:42.26]I'll just deal with it.
[97:45.98]I'll just deal with it.
[97:46.54]I'm just going to have to do this every few minutes.
[97:52.16]There we go.
[97:55.44]Okay.
[97:57.67]Full screen the game?
[97:58.43]The game is full screen.
[97:59.55]I mean, there is no... This game is like 12, 15 years old.
[98:02.97]Alright, here we go.
[98:05.41]Let's fight.
[98:06.29]Go fight.
[98:07.67]Go attack, go kill.
[98:24.43]Where are they?
[98:24.79]Why don't you guys go the long way?
[98:33.68]Jerma, can you explain how you got this game to work?
[98:35.52]Do you have the discs?
[98:36.82]Yes.
[98:38.64]Uh, so this game is currently running on the fan patch.
[98:43.52]There is, you have to get patch 1.1 and 1.2, and then you have to get the 1.3 fan patch, which fixes everything in the game.
[98:58.58]Wait, actually, you know what, can I just... Should I just attack?
[99:08.30]Get it!
[99:15.31]Just spy cap this fucking thing.
[99:16.69]Who cares?
[99:17.61]They're not even coming back.
[99:18.49]They're not even paying attention.
[99:26.49]They're too busy.
[99:27.35]They're too busy fighting on the two-fort bridge to realize I've taken the briefcase three times already.
[99:34.40]We win.
[99:34.56]Wait, they're not coming over here, are they?
[99:42.26]No, I'm gonna get it.
[99:42.78]This is gonna be it.
[99:50.26]I got it.
[99:50.64]I'm gonna own it.
[99:53.26]And then there's only one more town to take.
[99:55.18]Where's the creature?
[99:55.70]I'm gonna eat that villager.
[100:01.69]Why are you doing it so menacingly?
[100:05.39]Alright.
[100:05.65]No, no.
[100:05.87]Don't.
[100:06.13]Don't.
[100:06.69]Just... No, no, no.
[100:09.07]Do not...
[100:15.01]You know what?
[100:15.39]It's probably more efficient for him to eat villagers than to eat, like, 5,000 grain.
[100:19.07]I'm gonna be honest.
[100:24.88]Is it okay to destroy those trees?
[100:28.16]I'm going to turn that tree into wood chippings.
[100:30.64]Alright, good.
[100:31.40]We can take out some of his rage.
[100:39.24]Take out some of your frustrations.
[100:40.54]Do it.
[100:44.26]Yeah!
[100:46.76]You need this.
[100:49.40]I'm going to play with that villager, good.
[100:51.16]Okay, have fun.
[100:52.18]We're actually, we're gonna get it.
[100:53.50]I can't believe I just took this villager without anything.
[101:03.17]Nooooo!
[101:05.01]I can't, ugh.
[101:05.55]Fucking scroll wheel bullshit.
[101:10.89]I'm actually gonna have to get my iPad.
[101:13.67]I can't believe I got the village.
[101:24.47]It's iPad time.
[101:26.91]Punish him?
[101:27.59]Oh, wait, wait, we got... Hold on.
[101:30.46]Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.
[101:32.32]We have your land.
[101:33.70]Now what the fuck are you going to do?
[101:40.80]Where?
[101:41.28]Oh, fuck.
[101:42.18]Oh, my God.
[101:46.53]Uh-oh.
[101:51.07]Are we winning?
[101:52.81]We're not winning this fight.
[101:53.60]We're not winning the fight.
[101:54.58]I just got fucking collapsed on.
[101:57.48]Oh my god.
[101:58.42]They're here with their whole entire force.
[102:00.68]Uh... Murius!
[102:04.52]Murius!
[102:10.71]Stop playing with trees.
[102:12.59]I need you over here for a little bit.
[102:17.91]I'm out of breath?
[102:18.87]Stop running with a tree in your hand!
[102:21.58]What are you doing?
[102:25.80]I'm gonna gather from the field.
[102:29.36]Good job.
[102:32.51]Okay.
[102:33.73]Excellent work.
[102:34.57]I need you over here.
[102:36.21]It's time for you to start.
[102:36.95]It's time for you to have fun.
[102:38.33]I need you over here.
[102:39.77]I need you over here.
[102:44.58]Over here, over here, over here.
[102:56.18]You're being a bad parent.
[102:57.74]Look, I'm just trying to defend the world here.
[103:03.20]Coming?
[103:04.60]See?
[103:04.98]This is what I'm talking about.
[103:06.00]Show them your fucking anger.
[103:08.64]Show them your might.
[103:18.97]Tell them they can't be in here.
[103:21.27]You know what to do.
[103:22.96]Eat them.
[103:24.60]Leash to the army.
[103:31.12]I'm going to stomp all over the platoon.
[103:33.32]Good.
[103:34.92]Do it.
[103:38.00]Unleash it.
[103:41.70]They're faster than you.
[103:42.41]Hold on.
[103:42.73]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[103:44.11]Alright.
[103:44.35]Hey, hey, hey.
[103:44.73]Get him.
[103:48.53]Get him.
[103:51.39]There you go, Murius.
[103:54.51]Unleash your anger.
[103:58.69]I'm out of breath.
[103:59.75]It's okay.
[104:00.43]Just kick another one.
[104:01.47]Eat one.
[104:02.67]They have no match.
[104:05.21]Stop eating people.
[104:07.33]Eat them.
[104:11.99]There we go.
[104:13.45]Good job.
[104:17.64]Come on.
[104:19.34]I'm starving.
[104:20.08]You'll have plenty of food in about five seconds.
[104:23.14]Good fucking thunderclap.
[104:25.28]There it is.
[104:26.84]Yes.
[104:34.01]Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.
[104:37.23]Murius, I love you.
[104:39.25]You've done such a great job.
[104:40.85]Unbelievable work.
[104:43.17]Unbelievable.
[104:45.76]Nice work.
[104:46.24]Do you see that rage?
[104:47.06]Okay.
[104:48.72]Now literally eat as many of these people as you want.
[104:52.30]Okay.
[105:16.61]He only eats live meat?
[105:34.88]You're very good.
[105:36.14]I'll munch on their villagers all the time.
[105:38.40]They taste so serious.
[105:42.08]He's gonna get a dick.
[105:43.33]Look what he, look what he did.
[105:44.73]I'm so happy with him.
[105:49.25]That tastes for human flesh.
[105:52.15]Oh god.
[105:58.06]Alright, time for you to go to bed.
[105:59.82]You know what?
[106:00.20]We wiped out their whole village.
[106:01.46]Good job.
[106:04.91]I actually need, uh, what do we need here?
[106:07.67]Inspect.
[106:10.36]You can actually go, you can go to bed.
[106:11.96]You need to rest.
[106:12.44]What do you think about that, Mirrius?
[106:19.36]We should, we need that storehouse built quicker.
[106:22.34]I'm going to build the storehouse way more effective than he was in the last game.
[106:28.09]He's just aiming to police.
[106:29.95]He wants to police so much.
[106:33.23]That's not the store, oh, it is.
[106:37.69]So useful.
[106:40.59]You deserve a week's rest after this.
[106:44.91]Excellent job.
[106:47.27]No, I didn't want to... Very, very good.
[106:50.94]You are so... What a good cow.
[106:54.70]Link?
[106:55.30]Yeah.
[107:01.56]In fact, I probably should bring him back to sleep.
[107:03.08]Okay, we need... I have one more town to take over.
[107:06.18]There's a scroll over here, though.
[107:12.47]What a beautiful sunset.
[107:14.63]Yeah, you gotta love a big ball of fire.
[107:21.15]Let's see it again.
[107:22.59]By clicking the action button on the sky, the hand will change to sun dial mode.
[107:28.67]When the action button is released, the sun will move in the heavens.
[107:32.74]I can change the day-night cycle?
[107:34.06]Power over the sun.
[107:36.02]But with great power comes great responsibility.
[107:39.42]Boss, show us how it's done.
[107:43.46]I feel like this is fucking with everybody's head.
[107:57.32]Imagine you outside when this happened.
[108:12.25]Alright, so you can... I didn't know that's cool.
[108:23.49]Oh!
[108:23.67]Rooster?
[108:35.48]Oh, I need help.
[108:37.52]This rooster wakes me up every single day.
[108:40.56]I can't get enough sleep.
[108:42.82]Please help me to silence it.
[108:45.43]Maybe we can help him, leader.
[108:48.11]Such tasks do reap rewards, you know.
[108:51.05]Roosters always crow when the sun comes up.
[108:54.91]Perhaps if the sun came up a few times in a row, the rooster would keep crowing until it gets hoarse.
[109:06.90]But that's gonna fuck up every country on Earth.
[109:13.82]Silence this rooster by making three days happen instantly and fuck up all of Wall Street will close and the Dow will drop 25 million points.
[109:22.29]Is this smart?
[109:50.20]He's still going.
[109:55.68]You're rapidly moving the Earth.
[109:56.98]Everyone would just fly off.
[110:00.05]We'd all be like, like, everyone would fly into space.
[110:02.35]10,000?
[110:04.07]Would we be crushed?
[110:05.23]Would we get crushed?
[110:20.84]Speaking of crushed.
[110:22.56]Come on, I'm trying to satisfy the bloodlust of the people in chat.
[110:27.64]Alright, so... Marius?
[110:35.00]What are you up to?
[110:36.24]Hanging out?
[110:37.70]In fact, come back and go to sleep.
[110:38.86]I want you to grow.
[110:40.34]I want you to go to sleep.
[110:43.98]You've learned quite a lot.
[110:45.74]I want you to stay in the pen.
[110:47.86]And I want you to get some sleep.
[110:51.37]How's everybody doing in this town?
[110:52.67]We've got... More homes.
[110:56.67]Okay.
[110:59.24]Let's get some new houses.
[111:10.71]Population is booming in this town.
[111:15.87]That'll be alright for now.
[111:17.17]Yep, I know I fucked it up.
[111:18.47]It's okay, dude.
[111:19.21]Don't worry.
[111:23.14]A wink?
[111:23.68]What do you mean a wink?
[111:30.56]That channel... You guys are gonna wake up, like, at some point, like, in the next, like, four days, and it's gonna be like, oh, it's a popsicle stick joke now.
[111:45.79]I'm never gonna tell you what it is.
[111:52.21]Alright, how we doing?
[111:53.18]Is this good?
[111:53.68]This has been built?
[111:54.94]You have a storeroom now?
[111:55.90]Good.
[111:58.72]Is there any ore over here?
[112:00.12]There is.
[112:00.38]This is a mine right here.
[112:02.82]Armory?
[112:04.14]Yeah, okay.
[112:04.74]You guys can be the... We'll have another military here.
[112:06.62]We need some roads.
[112:08.44]I mean, how did you guys not even have any roads?
[112:16.09]How did you not have roads?
[112:34.06]That's fine.
[112:34.62]Okay.
[112:34.84]A little bit more.
[112:36.50]I gotta pee.
[112:39.58]Fuck.
[112:39.90]I gotta pee.
[112:40.84]Alright, I gotta pee.
[112:41.55]I gotta pee and I'm gonna figure out how to fix this chat scrolling problem.
[112:44.81]I gotta pee.
[112:45.11]I'm gonna pee my pants up your back.
[112:47.01]Pause the game.
[116:10.38]Okay.
[116:10.98]Hey.
[116:13.06]What's happening?
[116:20.12]What is happening?
[116:21.18]We're back.
[116:21.92]Alright, let's see if this worked.
[116:25.87]Yeah, I just did the fix you were talking about, Cad.
[116:28.67]Thank you, Cad.
[116:29.23]Let's see if this works.
[116:31.83]And... It might... It may have fixed it.
[116:34.51]It may have fixed it.
[116:35.41]Huh?
[116:37.45]Huh?
[116:40.11]Okay, I... Alright.
[116:41.99]Looks good.
[116:44.41]Alright, here we go.
[116:51.24]Uh, we need to take over... What's this?
[116:55.58]Uh, should I make... What's this?
[116:56.74]Something new?
[116:57.58]What's this thing?
[117:01.72]Ranged Armory?
[117:08.40]Alright, I can, wait, I can recruit ranks of archers.
[117:12.44]Yeah, let's get it.
[117:15.53]Lumber mill, yeah, let's get it.
[117:17.57]I don't know, hold on, I do.
[117:23.55]Close this, this is done, right?
[117:26.79]Ranged archery.
[117:32.77]Wait, wait, wait, wait, is this, I'm confused.
[117:36.13]Do I have to build a separate building for ranged?
[117:44.03]I do.
[117:44.87]Oh, shit.
[117:45.39]Okay.
[117:45.69]I need wood.
[117:48.97]Alright, we got away.
[117:49.53]Some of you guys, let's go.
[117:50.50]Bring some breeders.
[117:53.94]Are there any men?
[117:55.68]Alright, let's go.
[117:59.02]Forester.
[118:06.53]Forrester.
[118:07.35]Forrester.
[118:09.21]Forrester.
[118:09.93]More.
[118:12.91]We need more wood.
[118:17.43]Wood.
[118:18.85]And we need miners too.
[118:23.23]Subaru Forrester.
[118:24.51]This is going to be the base of operations for military.
[118:32.72]Can I put you here?
[118:33.30]Okay, good.
[118:34.38]Come on.
[118:34.64]Alright.
[118:35.28]That sets that.
[118:39.70]Now we have to deal with this one town here.
[118:43.66]Where's Marius?
[118:44.88]He's... He thinks something very funny.
[119:04.54]What was so funny?
[119:06.32]What are you laughing so hard at?
[119:08.26]You, like, laughing at an old man?
[119:10.32]I don't understand.
[119:19.32]What?
[119:21.98]What a dick.
[119:26.46]Haha, boomer.
[119:29.79]I'm going to snack on that grain.
[119:32.25]No, don't eat the grain!
[119:33.27]You're supposed to eat people!
[119:36.69]That's alright.
[119:37.35]Alright, I want an army, and we're going to take over the last village.
[119:43.77]Is he going back to laugh at the fucking old guy again?
[119:45.97]No.
[120:05.11]Okay, I don't know what his plan is, but... You're arrested.
[120:08.71]I need you down here.
[120:12.69]Come all the way over here, because we're going to take over the next town with, uh, Murius.
[120:15.89]And we're going to have some military here.
[120:18.72]So, come over here.
[120:20.00]Go for it.
[120:22.60]Let's, uh... Is this done?
[120:25.50]Not built yet?
[120:26.00]I want to build this.
[120:27.52]We're doing a whole military thing.
[120:33.07]Once we have enough wood.
[120:33.83]How much more wood do I need?
[120:36.09]A lot.
[120:37.71]I'm gonna start helping out here.
[120:38.49]Need ore.
[120:39.11]Alright, let's get a fucking army.
[120:40.83]Little bit more ore.
[121:03.69]Come on.
[121:06.63]Come on.
[121:08.50]Come on!
[121:10.54]Really?
[121:15.18]Come on!
[121:15.78]Ah!
[121:15.84]Okay, I got it.
[121:17.66]Did I just break it?
[121:25.21]What?
[121:25.65]I thought I needed more ore to build it!
[121:30.03]Alright, guys.
[121:30.81]It's time to fucking end Mission 1.
[121:38.23]No, no, pick up the flag.
[121:51.16]Is there not enough men?
[121:53.02]Oh, okay.
[121:53.50]That's alright.
[121:55.80]We only need a few.
[122:00.26]Look at this.
[122:00.66]I can't click the link.
[122:04.05]Because I have to alt-tab the game.
[122:05.59]And it might break.
[122:15.18]And I'm scared to break the game unless I hit the bot.
[122:17.74]Okay, what the fuck was that?
[122:19.38]Alright, you ready?
[122:23.77]The last town.
[122:24.51]Does it have a military?
[122:25.23]I think I already killed all the military.
[122:27.89]I did.
[122:28.67]Take it over.
[122:29.53]Miragus!
[122:33.35]Get over there.
[122:46.79]Just buy another computer?
[122:51.45]No, you mean like buy like an old... You want me to capture a computer through a capture card?
[122:58.27]Have an old computer and capture with my other computer?
[123:01.91]I mean, this game runs fine.
[123:09.85]Alright, Murius inspected.
[123:10.95]Just be a presence.
[123:14.41]I'm gonna play with that building.
[123:15.61]Yes.
[123:15.91]Go for it.
[123:18.83]Learn.
[123:19.41]Think.
[123:19.95]Touch.
[123:20.55]Inspect.
[123:23.70]Oh, you could eat somebody.
[123:24.54]That works too.
[123:42.11]Oh, screaming.
[123:58.07]Did he step in it?
[123:59.39]Oh, no.
[124:01.39]Six flags.
[124:06.81]He's just shitting their food.
[124:12.48]You did it.
[124:12.96]No, don't pick up a person.
[124:14.62]What are you doing?
[124:15.72]They're capturing.
[124:18.09]Put him down.
[124:18.85]Put him down.
[124:20.19]Put him down.
[124:20.67]Wait, are you putting him into the... What are you doing?
[124:23.91]You're telling him to work in the field.
[124:32.62]Sleep next to the building?
[124:33.94]No, no, no.
[124:39.04]We almost got him.
[124:42.13]He's just a baby.
[124:42.83]He doesn't really know what he's doing.
[124:52.23]That was such a toddler run.
[124:55.63]If I've ever seen one.
[125:02.33]It's time for Murius to get a skill tree.
[125:21.55]First, we need to restore our people to their former glory and visit all the other races to gather their support.
[125:28.95]Forget support.
[125:30.39]Where were they when we needed them, huh?
[125:33.73]Let's just conquer them.
[125:35.73]Come on, let's go.
[125:40.48]Okay.
[125:42.22]If you want to leave this land, click on the gold scroll.
[125:48.60]Let's go.
[125:51.25]Are you sure you wish to leave the land?
[125:54.01]I'm ready.
[125:54.33]Kick again to confirm.
[125:55.59]Yeah, let's go.
[125:56.43]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[126:08.68]Don't be evil.
[126:11.07]I thought that was a pop-up window talking about the game crashed.
[126:15.29]Do you want to force quit?
[126:17.15]I thought that's what this was.
[126:18.87]Look, I'm only 1% evil, guys.
[126:22.91]Number of talents taken by force, three.
[126:25.25]One for, okay, creature.
[126:27.81]Creature is only 5% evil.
[126:31.03]Fatness.
[126:32.67]Fatness, fatness.
[126:37.37]Um, what does that even mean?
[126:40.05]Fitness.
[126:44.43]Height, four.
[126:46.01]Final.
[126:47.49]Hit points, 100.
[126:48.37]Number of bowel movements, 11.
[126:50.35]Killed 34 people.
[126:54.13]It's eight, six villagers, okay.
[127:00.80]World, happiness.
[127:03.60]Vital, yeah, alright, we're good.
[127:05.12]Let's go.
[127:09.40]34 people killed, only 4% evil.
[127:10.80]Well, those were attacking people.
[127:12.16]That was an attacking group.
[127:18.75]The Norse land.
[127:20.49]I'm certain they'll join us against the Aztec hordes.
[127:24.51]And they have a creature, too.
[127:26.53]We need to build a town here, though.
[127:28.93]We need the tribe to grow.
[127:31.83]First, let's look at the Norse.
[127:34.39]They seems they have a weak... Concentrate, and your godly powers will often let you hear his thoughts.
[127:41.39]I was the aggressor?
[127:42.13]What?
[127:42.35]Greeks on my homeland?
[127:44.73]But I saw them all die at the hands of the Aztecs.
[127:49.57]Who's talking?
[127:50.95]Do they have a devil in a... Angel?

[129:02.01]Okay.
[129:24.63]That was so bad.
[129:26.89]There's no wall here.

[129:33.04]It's an ugly ass wall.
[129:35.92]Drag wall from- wait, didn't I just- Did I do this right?
[129:46.59]It needs like ore or something?

[139:09.17]I had to do it in a specific place.
[139:12.03]Alright, lots of food.
[139:14.33]There's also something new over here.
[139:17.41]If you want your town to grow quickly, it'll need lots of food.
[139:22.56]Our creature can help with this by gathering crops.
[139:26.76]You dope.
[139:28.94]All you have to do is assign him the role of gatherer near a field.
[139:33.79]To assign the creature a role, open the creature roles interface.
[139:39.15]Okay creature role gatherer He's asleep, I mean over here, I mean the big one is probably the best one to do
[140:11.69]See the radius around the flag?
[140:14.04]The creature will gather resources from within that.
[140:16.94]That's actually really cool.
[140:17.88]Okay.
[140:18.00]He'll always carry out roles inside the radius.
[140:20.66]Wake his ass up.
[140:21.62]And then put them in your storehouse.
[140:23.50]Hey, relax.
[140:24.78]At the moment, your creature isn't a very good collector.
[140:28.28]He's not gathering much grain each time.
[140:31.94]Free will.
[140:32.22]Should we just give him free will?
[140:33.96]Just give him complete free will.
[140:35.87]You're supposed to be gathering food.
[141:01.84]He loves trees.
[141:02.78]Oh, shit.
[141:14.14]He's a free spirit.
[141:15.42]Oh no.
[141:36.87]Leave him in a room for too long and he'll become more like a machine than a pit Oh, no human rolls for a while is fine.
[141:44.98]I Don't like that and you can see how much free will he has by looking at this on the creature interface Okay interesting to remove your creature from a role click on the freely will button
[142:00.46]now why not play around with rules and stuff boss entertainer get a bigger town out of it and remember if you get attacked make him a warrior we share the hatred who do these greeks think they are alright we'll go back to free will free will you you're able you can do whatever you want you don't have to gather anymore free will

[142:30.23]I don't want you just gathering food all day.
[142:32.47]Alright, let me build, I gotta build some warriors area.
[142:42.38]We need a armory.
[142:45.38]Because, I mean, we have to have one.

[143:04.43]Oh, these Greeks.
[143:05.57]I thought they were destroyed.
[143:06.81]And I'm going to kill them and destroy them.
[143:08.87]I thought the Aztecs wiped them out.
[143:10.51]Oh, I thought they were peaceful people.
[143:11.85]What the fuck?
[143:14.52]How dare they encroach on my land?
[143:16.28]Uh-oh.
[143:21.20]There he is.

[143:50.52]I'm not going to kill anybody yet.
[143:51.78]Not yet.
[143:57.36]Okay, let's see.

[144:06.80]Look.
[144:07.68]Look what I have.
[144:10.79]Isn't that interesting?
[144:12.95]Don't you think that was interesting?
[144:16.35]Cool, huh?
[144:19.29]Why is he sad?
[144:19.97]What's wrong?
[144:28.02]Go do whatever you want.
[144:32.88]He's all about the trees.
[144:34.12]And that's fine.
[144:35.70]As long as you gather it and put it in the right spot.
[144:41.43]Alright, I need... How's the armory looking?
[144:43.59]Not even close.
[144:46.17]The Aztecs want to rule.
[144:48.50]They need the Greeks destroyed.
[144:58.95]I'm just preparing in case I get attacked.
[145:05.07]What the hell was I doing here?
[145:05.93]Alright, what do we need?
[145:06.51]What do I need?
[145:08.67]Food.
[145:09.03]More food.
[145:10.45]We have plenty of wood.
[145:11.31]More food.
[145:12.00]Fuck, how can we... We need more farmers.
[145:20.82]How many people are actually farming right now?
[145:24.93]Zero out of seven.
[145:27.05]One out of five.
[145:29.31]One out of eight.
[145:30.25]How the fuck?
[145:31.63]We need more.
[145:36.01]Farms.
[145:37.82]Get over here.
[145:38.28]Your cow is eating them.
[145:39.94]No, he's not.
[145:42.58]He's fine.
[145:44.68]He's just dancing.
[145:56.50]They're having a good time.
[145:58.58]Is he growing?
[146:00.62]Alright, let this guy hang out and be happy.
[146:08.20]Yeah, the split.
[146:09.28]I'm glad the split's back.
[146:11.61]More farmers.
[146:14.81]Alright, now we got a lot.
[146:18.39]Workers in the field.
[146:19.29]Alright, we have at least ten people doing this.
[146:23.74]The Greeks mock us with their very existence.
[146:28.56]Are you going to deposit?
[146:30.60]Deposit rock.
[146:35.25]That was... Whatever.
[146:38.09]Should I turn these rocks around with some poo?
[146:43.55]Sure.
[146:45.07]Poo on the rocks.
[146:46.25]If that's really what you want to do.
[146:49.35]In fact, it's better if you poo on the rocks and not on people.
[146:52.17]Because people will be very upset by that.
[146:53.63]So if you have to go to the bathroom, go to the bathroom behind a tree.
[146:56.26]Should I poo on that villager?
[146:58.84]No, don't poo on a villager.
[147:02.28]You just asked to poo on a rock.
[147:04.66]Why are you asking this question now?
[147:06.19]I just told you to poo on a rock.
[147:19.81]Alright, his curiosity is killing me right now.
[147:24.36]What does this even mean?
[147:26.42]He doesn't actually poop on them, right?
[147:35.30]He's lying.
[147:39.00]He can't get it.
[148:02.38]Clean up the poo.
[148:05.06]Oh, he just hit his head.
[148:05.96]Are you alright?
[148:06.52]Alright, I gotta... Let's keep going.
[148:10.40]I'm gonna gather food.

[149:21.90]This is doing a whole lot of nothing.
[149:23.02]Alright, farms.
[149:24.65]Disciple farmer.
[149:27.26]Let's get a military.
[149:31.52]How many people can I make here, though?
[149:33.15]I don't want to destroy the whole economy.
[149:34.55]Platoon size.
[149:38.61]Available men, five.
[149:39.49]Available men, 25.
[149:40.17]Alright, I'm going to do...

[149:55.36]Are they waiting to go into the house to breed?
[149:59.12]I don't understand what they're doing.
[150:20.81]You can make fields any size you like.
[150:34.63]Yeah, we learned that a few minutes ago.
[150:36.41]We're good.
[150:38.25]What are we missing?
[150:38.89]Let's put this wood in the store where it belongs.
[150:51.34]Stray wood everywhere.
[150:52.60]Okay.

[151:04.19]What is this?
[151:04.61]Grain?
[151:10.01]Watch it.
[151:13.12]How many are in this platoon?
[151:15.16]I'm going to stomp all over that platoon.
[151:19.06]Is that what you want?
[151:20.16]Is that what you want to do?
[151:21.00]No, I wouldn't... You're okay.
[151:23.72]No, no, no, no, no.

[176:09.21]Punishment spike?
[176:15.68]A good creature toy, playing with this has an effect on alignment, shifting towards good.
[176:19.30]Let's get it.
[176:28.28]How do you like it?
[176:28.82]Check it out.
[176:33.39]Do you like it?
[176:40.35]Give it a look.
[176:46.29]I'm going to play with that toy.
[176:50.81]He loves it.
[176:54.26]He loves it.
[177:02.15]Hey!
[177:05.89]Don't be so rough.
[177:07.49]Did you break it?
[177:08.25]He broke it.
[177:09.15]He broke it!
[177:09.75]He broke it!
[177:10.11]Did he?
[177:10.95]Where is it?
[177:28.68]of respawns.
[177:29.44]Okay, well, why did he destroy it?
[177:31.16]Whatever, he was just playing with it.
[177:36.44]Put in punishment spikes.
[177:37.74]I'm not gonna... No, that's fucked up.
[177:39.60]I don't wanna do that.
[177:42.15]Alright, what do I wanna do?
[177:44.83]Do I not have access to... How come I don't have access to the torture pit?
[177:58.99]Do I need, like, an altar or something?
[178:00.51]I have all this stuff, don't I?
[178:08.50]I guess I'll put an altar in here.
[178:11.56]They don't have one.
[178:12.14]You gotta buy it.
[178:28.61]And just getting some influence, hold on.
[178:34.51]They have wood in the storeroom, so I should probably use the wood in the storeroom.
[178:40.77]I'm gonna have some fun playing with that tree.
[178:44.37]Good.
[178:49.31]You have to be evil to get it.
[178:52.34]Oh, that makes sense.
[179:00.56]God, let me get some worshippers in here.
[179:01.98]I'm gonna influence these two and I'm not gonna have to do anything.
[179:06.38]I'm not gonna have to fight anybody.
[179:13.50]Who's available?
[179:17.22]You are.
[179:19.63]You are available.
[179:21.37]Disciple worshipper.
[179:26.16]Ready?
[179:26.54]Are there any side quests that I missed?
[179:38.07]I haven't seen any.
[179:41.09]Should I work out using trees?
[179:43.45]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[179:45.61]That's way better.
[179:47.39]I'm gonna, yeah, weight lift the tree.
[179:54.23]That's way better than a person.
[179:55.19]It weighs like 5,000 times more than a person.
[180:04.48]Maybe he'll get big.
[180:08.18]Muscles.
[180:08.60]Alright, let's do another... More houses.
[180:15.39]Put them down here.
[180:16.71]Start our influence campaign this way.
[180:18.71]And then that way.
[180:35.16]Get a shitload of wood.
[180:35.92]Put it over here.
[180:39.90]Why is this evil?
[180:41.92]Is it gonna lift it?
[180:44.94]Do some exercises.
[180:45.88]You need to get bigger and stronger.
[180:56.44]He doesn't get it.
[180:57.14]Do I eat rocks or are they bad for my teeth?
[181:02.65]No, no, no, don't eat rocks.
[181:04.51]I'm going to eat that rock.
[181:05.61]Don't eat a rock.
[181:07.11]No.
[181:08.23]No, I'm trying to... I'm trying to tell you don't eat rocks.
[181:23.49]Don't eat.
[181:26.59]Oh my god.
[181:28.45]Don't eat rocks.
[181:31.67]Don't eat rocks.
[181:34.57]Don't eat rocks.
[181:36.31]Don't eat rocks.
[181:38.12]Don't eat rocks.
[181:39.88]Okay.
[181:42.68]I'm trying to be gentle.
[181:43.86]Don't eat rocks.
[181:50.22]Eat food.
[181:52.68]I wonder if I could fit that toy in my mouth.
[182:02.24]I wonder if I could fit the toy in my mouth.
[182:06.03]Sentences said before disaster.
[182:10.87]Well, he lost track of what he was doing.
[182:19.80]Let him learn.
[182:20.50]We're going to be at the doctor.
[182:24.40]He's going to end up with like a marble in his nose.
[182:26.06]Even more.
[182:26.56]Let's keep going.
[182:28.58]Armory.
[182:49.60]Put it back a little.

[182:58.41]2,000.
[182:58.89]I need 500 ore.
[183:00.55]Okay.
[183:06.37]Cows eat rocks.
[183:07.13]It's good for their digestion.
[183:08.11]I don't think that's real.
[183:08.85]I think... What are you saying?
[183:11.89]Is it accurate?
[183:17.27]Keep it going.
[183:25.44]I'm slowly gonna encroach.
[183:26.74]I'm just building power plants up into their base.
[183:39.29]Do the quests?
[183:49.67]Um, I was trying to look and see if there are any on the... Oh, you're talking about just, like, little tasks up at the top left.

[192:49.69]He's not scratching.
[192:50.77]I don't even know what to say.
[192:55.32]I'm going to build that structure.
[192:58.70]Wait, he's gonna go over here and help build this farm?
[193:09.24]Yes, yes, you should entertain them.
[193:11.12]Entertain them while we conquer them.
[193:13.18]Entertain them.
[193:45.17]This doesn't seem very entertaining.
[193:48.49]Who is he playing with?
[193:57.34]I'm going to go and gather that tree.
[194:03.38]I can't fucking take it anymore.
[194:05.66]He's so all over the place.
[194:11.58]I hope he brings it all the way back to his house.
[194:13.36]Please do that.
[194:15.26]No, he's just an idiot.
[194:18.60]He's just putting it into a pile over here.
[194:20.35]Why is there a fun song playing?
[195:18.21]He's looking right in the camera with these like sinister fucking- what is he doing?
[195:33.75]Where are you going?

[196:02.76]We almost got this town.
[196:15.33]Actually, in the meantime, I'm going to go start building out this way.
[196:20.07]Murius can sleep for a little bit.
[196:21.41]Let's continue building out here.
[196:22.49]And let's do a water spell.

[196:37.57]Everyone worship here.
[196:38.39]That's not doing anything.
[196:39.35]Alright, Murius is awake.

[204:16.32]Why are they all doing this?
[204:22.69]What are they doing?
[204:24.93]Why is every single person walking into town?
[204:27.33]What's going on?
[204:28.73]Farmer, farmer, farmer.
[204:41.80]What's with the... You hear the bell?
[204:43.48]This fucking bell is ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[204:47.97]Where are they going?
[204:49.75]Wait.
[204:49.95]Oh, I thought there was a battle going on.
[204:57.79]Wait, the gate is open.
[204:59.77]Has the gate been open the whole time?
[205:02.84]Oh, fuck me.
[205:03.56]Hold on.
[205:05.30]Oh, shit.
[205:06.02]Who's taking this over?
[205:08.08]What's going on?
[205:08.60]Hey, hey!
[205:08.82]Come here, come here, come here.
[205:11.46]All of you.
[205:17.01]Defend, defend, defend.
[205:18.09]Furious.
[205:23.05]No, shit.
[205:26.21]Come here.
[205:26.47]Come here.
[205:26.67]Come here.
[205:26.87]I need you.
[205:27.35]I need you over here.
[205:32.23]Come here.
[205:32.75]Soldier.
[205:33.83]Defend the city.
[205:36.09]Defend.
[205:36.45]Defend.
[205:36.75]Defend.
[205:39.25]Get in here.
[205:39.65]They're not taking this shit.
[205:41.63]Kill them.
[205:41.89]I actually think they have this under control.
[205:45.15]Maybe not.
[205:52.56]How fast can you get here, Mirrors?
[206:03.46]He's alive?
[206:04.94]No.
[206:06.56]I think this is okay.
[206:07.32]They're not gonna get it.
[206:11.72]No, you show them.
[206:14.57]You show them your fucking anger.
[206:18.39]Fight.
[206:22.69]Just be careful of the other people.
[206:25.24]Great.
[206:26.42]He stepped on a kid.
[206:35.51]It's okay.
[206:36.69]We've removed them.
[206:42.69]No, you killed everybody.
[206:44.07]Creature collects 3,000 food.
[206:46.56]Alright, this is ours.
[206:47.92]Calm down.
[206:48.24]This is our stuff.
[206:48.86]Relax.
[206:49.02]Relax, relax, relax.
[206:49.78]Cool down.
[206:50.24]Cool down.
[206:50.52]Raise the morale.
[207:13.60]Yes.
[207:15.54]Hooray.
[207:16.22]Good, good, good.
[207:18.40]Stay down here.
[207:19.02]I want to play.
[207:20.97]You've earned it.
[207:22.43]You can do free will for a little while.
[207:23.65]Let me go back up here.
[207:31.45]What does this mean?
[207:44.55]Does this have an armory?
[207:46.43]No.
[207:51.71]Why can I not build an armory here?
[208:00.03]But I can build it.
[208:01.03]Wait, is this already being built?
[208:02.33]What is this?
[208:02.77]It's not of people?
[208:09.69]I don't understand.
[208:12.51]It's too steep.
[208:13.77]Oh, okay.
[208:15.89]I gotta go down, and I gotta get this town here.
[208:20.46]How's this town looking?
[208:22.68]I'd like to influence this town, but do I have to keep... Okay, I have a question.
[208:26.58]Do I have to build all the way down here to get them to care?
[208:33.72]Or... No, I don't.
[208:36.04]Okay.
[208:36.14]I just have to be impressive.
[208:37.70]Impressive.
[208:41.44]Yeah, that makes sense.
[208:42.14]So now, let's take a look.
[208:45.42]How do I see the actual stats?
[208:46.62]I have to zoom in to sit here, right?
[208:49.14]Impressiveness required to capture.
[208:53.41]Gamhaven.
[208:56.25]Okay, I need more impressiveness.
[209:00.41]Where's Gamhaven?
[209:02.85]What the fuck is that?
[209:09.16]You know, make it...
[209:10.48]Make it daytime, I can't see anything.
[209:14.64]These guys are still just walking around.
[209:16.05]Yeah, make it daytime.
[209:18.27]Let's go.
[209:18.87]Everybody out.
[209:24.37]They've been there the whole game, too.
[209:27.66]Invent Fortnite to gain followers.
[209:34.22]I'm gonna keep working up over here.
[209:35.22]Wait.
[209:35.96]There's a little town right here.
[209:39.34]What?
[209:39.80]Where?
[209:40.52]Oh, right here.
[209:47.80]Here he is.
[209:52.92]Soldier mode.
[209:53.48]Come on.
[209:58.55]You can take him on by yourself.
[209:59.83]I have to get rid of this village up here.
[210:04.35]Why would you ever do this without your creature, knowing that I have one down here?
[210:13.99]Start eating people.
[210:17.30]A huge soccer kick.
[210:20.36]Watch out for the buildings.
[210:21.22]Watch out for other people.
[210:26.64]Now he just scratches his ass.
[210:32.39]Why is he so itchy?
[210:37.11]Back to free will, good luck.
[210:47.92]I wonder what I should do with this guy.
[210:52.43]Bathe him?
[210:53.37]He'll be alright.
[210:55.81]I'm gonna go... I gotta get this right now.
[210:59.51]Okay, I just destroyed their... all their shit.
[211:03.41]I'm gonna capture it with... I'm just gonna take this one guy.
[211:05.77]I don't think the speed... capture speed goes any... Are they all clapping and happy about the shit all over the ground?
[211:12.07]Probably.
[211:12.93]It's weird.
[211:15.41]Alright, we're gonna go in and capture this.
[211:21.34]Hang out right here, Amirius.
[211:22.32]Go kill everybody.
[211:28.34]Let's take this.
[211:28.82]We're gonna take this by force, too.
[211:33.76]He's got one more group.
[211:37.35]And then I got... One guy can just capture the whole thing.
[211:39.65]Don't matter.
[211:45.88]Looks like he's growing, too.
[211:46.64]He looks bigger than he does before.
[211:48.16]Alright, now where's this guy?
[211:56.18]You go in there and take care of that.
[211:59.34]You... Capture it.
[212:02.46]Evil.
[212:04.04]Evil.
[212:16.35]Alright.
[212:17.11]Now just stay here.
[212:20.79]Watch the punch.
[212:21.49]Jump on him!
[212:27.81]Jump on him!
[212:28.37]Stay here.
[212:41.93]Take it over.
[212:42.57]No other armies.
[212:43.47]Okay, there's an army coming right here, but we should be able to defend this.
[212:47.35]In the meantime, hold on.
[212:48.15]I'm going to send some support.
[212:53.41]Do I have any support?
[212:54.15]I have these guys.
[212:54.83]What the fuck was that?
[212:57.05]It was like a gunshot.
[212:59.88]Oh, okay.
[213:00.58]It's a kick in a building.
[213:07.22]Are they coming down here?
[213:11.55]Do the scroll quest?
[213:12.55]I haven't seen any.
[213:14.65]I don't see any scrolls on the map.
[213:21.78]Have you guys seen any?
[213:22.44]I haven't seen one.
[213:23.06]Oh, there's one right here.
[213:32.61]Okay.
[213:37.32]Help us.
[213:38.68]We need to finish our special brew.
[213:41.46]Throw this barrel to my brother over there so he can add his ingredient.
[213:45.38]Then throw it to my other brother on the next island.
[213:48.08]It needs to go to them all in turn until our brew is finished.
[213:54.64]Barrel throwing quest.
[213:55.83]Oh, I'm wishing he's brewing this notion of barrels here on the sand.
[214:01.57]Will you help me throw it to my brother on the other land?
[214:14.04]Sure Um Throw it to my brother on the other land Uh
[214:45.26]This is kind of... Okay, what is... I don't understand.
[214:55.47]Why can't I pick up the... This is like a weird plot.
[214:59.01]Well, I... I did it.
[215:04.33]Did I do it?
[215:04.97]I mean... Did you get it?
[215:20.46]So throw it back.
[215:21.66]No, throw it over here.
[215:50.14]Okay.

[216:39.94]Dead shit!
[216:51.54]Not again, right?
[216:57.93]I'm just waiting for Murius to come over here and just fucking eat this guy.
[217:10.51]In the middle of a cutscene, I just wanted something to happen.
[217:14.26]Alright, so now we're going from... Oh my goodness.
[217:16.52]We're going from here?
[217:17.48]We have to throw it across the whole thing?
[217:19.66]Oh, this is gonna actually suck.
[217:23.39]Okay, so... I hear... I hear his kicking shit.
[217:31.69]Okay, so now let's go from... Uh...
[217:55.66]What's up the ticking?
[217:56.90]I'm ticking over a town.
[217:57.96]I'm currently ticking over a town.
[218:01.70]Mirais is kicking shit.
[218:05.31]Done.
[218:09.45]Hooray.
[218:09.83]Yeah, I got one guy taking a town over.
[218:16.70]Apparently.
[218:24.70]Oops, wrong button.
[218:30.70]I was trying to press this button.
[218:33.35]I thought that was the camera button.
[218:38.70]To the same spot where the camera button usually is.
[218:52.85]20,000 points.
[218:53.65]Alright, now, Murius, where are you?
[218:56.77]I'm soaking.
[218:58.98]Good.
[218:59.28]And you need to take this place open.
[219:00.44]You need to hang out.
[219:04.58]Oh, he's wrecking this place.
[219:05.88]Alright, you don't need to wreck this place.
[219:07.54]Just be an entertainer for a little while.
[219:13.19]Entertain this person.
[219:14.57]This is the last person that you haven't killed.
[219:16.39]I'm so happy!
[219:43.16]They're still working.
[219:44.76]Wait, are they rebuilding the town as he destroys it?
[219:47.06]That's kind of fucked up.
[219:50.70]Well, he's on happy mode, so... Yes, hi, I see you.
[219:57.97]Hello.
[219:58.41]Wait, who's that?
[219:59.27]Is it the pot?
[219:59.79]No, I guess not.
[220:00.63]Almost have it.
[220:14.39]Like peekaboo?
[220:15.35]First thing that's getting built here is a creature town.
[220:25.74]What's a pot market?
[220:27.16]How come I can't build a pot market?
[220:38.70]Why do they build and wait?
[220:42.33]Alright, you can hang.
[220:43.03]I need to create your city in a second.
[220:45.31]This is very... No, no, don't!
[220:48.69]No!
[220:48.87]Murius!

[221:08.14]I got the town, right?
[221:09.12]Okay.
[221:09.94]I was gonna say, that's the only guy capturing the city.
[221:13.65]No, you don't have to play with the villager.
[221:14.89]Just relax.
[221:21.01]I need a creature den.
[221:22.23]Can I put you anywhere?
[221:34.52]Help me build this building, Muris.
[221:37.04]They don't have shit, though.
[221:37.72]They have nothing.
[221:38.40]They have a little bit of wood.
[221:43.12]Actually, they got quite a bit.
[221:53.40]Good, gather.
[221:54.72]Uh, fields.
[221:58.56]Good job, areas.
[221:59.42]We need to maybe rebuild some of this stuff.
[222:00.95]How are the townspeople doing?
[222:01.85]Breeding.
[222:03.81]Disciple breeder.
[222:07.57]Any forests around here?
[222:08.59]I need a mine.
[222:10.31]Disciple forester.
[222:13.35]I'm kind of evil.
[222:15.25]Only that?
[222:15.61]7% is not bad.
[222:23.08]You're pooing on the rocks?
[222:25.72]There are no rocks.
[222:26.44]I got this one.
[222:30.20]Uh, forester.
[222:31.74]Forester.
[222:32.18]I need farm.
[222:33.22]Let's do a big, just one huge ass farm over here.
[222:47.14]Who cares?
[222:48.16]Just one big-ass farm.
[222:49.06]All people standing around, get in there.
[223:00.67]Alright, now we should start to get some good shit.
[223:15.64]Breeders are over there.
[223:16.50]Okay, there's an ore over here.
[223:19.12]Good.
[223:19.24]Oh, you think you're going to come in here, don't you?
[223:25.22]Well, I got a fix for that.
[223:32.72]You're quite happy?
[223:33.78]Good.
[223:34.28]You're about to be even more happy.
[223:37.52]Attack.
[223:37.80]What do you have in your hand?
[223:43.48]What is that?
[223:45.71]He has a grain in his hands?
[223:52.85]Not much, but just, you're doing fine.
[223:56.34]Get him!
[223:57.72]Alright, pick up tree, throw tree.
[224:01.18]Where is he?
[224:01.62]Are they hiding in the trees?
[224:13.27]Alright, throw.
[224:14.75]Throw at them.
[224:20.89]Crush them.
[224:26.72]Can he reach from here?
[224:32.72]Attack.
[224:34.58]Attack with your new melee weapon.
[224:37.34]Tree.
[224:46.87]Get him!
[224:49.69]Attack!
[224:51.33]Holy shit, he does use it.
[224:52.47]He uses it as a fucking weapon.
[225:05.57]Run him out of town.
[225:06.17]Holy shit, that's so dangerous.
[225:11.63]That's so dangerous.
[225:12.93]Get him out of here.
[225:13.57]Get him out.
[225:14.03]Get him out.
[225:17.90]He's gonna kill everybody.
[225:25.86]Let us wait and see what the Greeks are planning.
[225:30.54]Go after them.
[225:32.30]The people are getting wasted.
[225:34.30]What?
[225:36.52]Where?
[225:42.99]Where?
[225:43.35]What?
[225:43.53]I don't understand.
[225:44.15]Where am I getting attacked?
[225:48.29]Alright, just throw it.
[225:49.63]Oh, here we go.
[225:55.63]Oh my god, just fucking throw it.
[225:57.35]Throw it.
[225:59.93]Throw the... Yes, good.
[226:01.84]Smart.
[226:03.14]Where is this other attack going on?
[226:11.80]I think it's only just right here.
[226:15.53]Throw downhill?
[226:17.05]He wouldn't throw it.
[226:18.03]There was no thing to throw.
[226:19.12]They're just running away from him.
[226:30.66]Murius, Murius, Murius, Murius, Murius, please.
[226:33.50]I'm trying.
[226:35.64]I'm trying.
[226:40.39]Alright, pick up a fucking tree.
[226:41.73]I'm gonna throw it.
[226:43.82]How do you throw something?
[226:44.92]Throw!
[226:45.26]Alright.
[226:48.52]Throw it!
[226:49.04]Throw!
[227:00.65]Get it again!
[227:02.05]Get it!
[227:02.41]Alright, we're gonna throw it downhill.
[227:17.28]No, he's got a f***ing piece of grain.
[227:26.55]Kill them!
[227:31.95]Oh my god, Mirias, what the f*** are you doing?
[227:38.38]They're like dragging him.
[227:41.58]Finally!
[227:42.18]You stepped on somebody.
[227:46.52]He'll kill them eventually.
[227:52.13]What was I doing?
[227:52.67]How do I throw?
[227:56.97]I can't change the throw.
[228:16.20]They're all just hurt somebody.
[228:19.00]Do something, Murius.
[228:20.18]You're fucking killing me.
[228:31.02]You gotta do something.
[228:32.98]Don't I have an army?
[228:33.97]I do have to make a new army.
[228:35.07]Alright, right here.
[228:36.93]Stop, stop, stop.
[228:37.39]Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack.
[228:41.53]You killed somebody.
[228:42.15]Good.
[228:45.93]He's just wrecking this town, too.
[228:48.97]Just defend this area.
[228:50.57]There's no reason for you to run around in circles.
[228:52.21]Come here.
[228:53.73]Just defend.
[228:54.31]Defend.
[228:56.26]I'm going to go get my actual army.

[228:59.32]No, there's not.
[229:02.92]Give me my actual fucking army and just defend over here.
[229:10.09]Just... Don't get them, please.
[229:53.53]They just run in and run out.
[229:55.93]Mirias, get them!
[229:58.88]Get them!
[229:59.32]Alright, my actual team is here.
[230:24.11]This is like the stupidest army ever.
[230:25.63]They're just running in circles.
[230:29.73]Absolutely decimated.
[230:30.89]Just decimated.
[230:38.54]Time for a counter-attack.
[230:40.22]Yes, they did.
[230:41.36]Every time we do.
[230:42.12]I mean, we will continue to every time.
[230:50.00]Let's go.
[230:50.68]Here he is.
[230:51.34]Free will.
[230:52.40]He's alright.
[230:53.46]Instead of wink, it's turning into just like...
[231:21.47]Stay together.
[231:24.21]It's time to go kill this motherfucker.
[231:29.42]He's streaming in a cave!
[231:31.80]Yes!
[231:32.34]Yes!
[231:46.12]You know what?
[231:47.62]Sleep for now.
[231:52.36]You guys hang out here for a little bit.
[231:56.87]This should be enough to take the other city.
[232:00.11]What else do we got?
[232:01.07]Take a little rest.
[232:02.87]Let's get some food for Murius, and then we're gonna go in.
[232:07.76]And here's... This is his final... This is his stronghold here.
[232:09.72]He's got nothing else.
[232:13.28]He does have... Look at how much of a little baby this is, though.
[232:16.96]Murius is going to karate chop this guy in the head.
[232:20.66]And instantly knock him out.
[232:21.76]It's going to be awesome.
[232:33.26]Yeah, he doesn't stand a chance.
[232:34.90]I got like five tons.
[232:39.05]Get some rest.
[232:45.28]This is a level 3.
[232:46.90]Health 58.
[232:47.78]How do I... Is there a... Can I heal these guys?
[232:49.72]Can they, like, rest?
[232:52.84]Is there a way to, like, heal them or make them feel better or feed them or something?
[232:56.02]Make them heal?
[232:57.33]Maybe feed them?
[233:03.25]Food?
[233:04.97]Alright, Birrius.
[233:07.49]It's time for you to eat.
[233:08.19]Why don't you not like me?
[233:11.04]What?
[233:11.14]What?
[233:13.81]I'm depressed.
[233:14.87]Oh, shit.

[233:22.91]What is that weird movement?
[233:28.26]Alright, here we go.
[233:30.96]Mirrus, I want you to eat... ...eat this guy.

[233:57.92]Alright, we need to get... Here, eat this.
[234:03.66]Try that.
[234:04.06]That's a... Is this a pig?
[234:06.90]No, that's a cow.
[234:10.71]This is cannibalism, so don't do that.
[234:14.69]I can't get there.
[234:22.41]Alright, whatever.
[234:23.25]Okay, ready?
[234:27.37]Here we go.

[234:30.93]He's full.
[234:33.83]It's time to begin.
[234:37.68]Mirias, go in.
[234:38.76]Everyone... Actually, let's have you guys come up here too.
[234:43.74]We might get a creature fight here, which I have to be prepared for.
[234:56.99]Let's get a morale boost.
[235:04.72]Raise morale.
[235:06.26]Let's see what happens.
[235:12.32]Do it.
[235:14.34]War cry.
[235:17.94]Oh, look at all these people.
[235:19.88]War cry.
[235:20.44]Do it.

[235:28.94]Pretty good war cry.
[235:30.06]Let's go.
[235:36.60]Bring the fight to them.
[235:37.48]Hey, Muris.
[235:44.64]Hey!
[235:48.37]Don't go in.
[235:49.03]Stay behind.
[235:49.55]Raise morale.
[235:51.23]Don't attack.
[235:51.65]Raise morale.
[236:00.33]You need to help.
[236:02.31]Yes, this is a fight.
[236:06.45]Raise morale.
[236:09.25]There we go.
[236:09.83]Good.
[236:14.17]No!
[236:14.81]You're supposed to raise morale, not start fighting.
[236:17.15]Take it.
[236:17.49]Capture.
[236:30.06]Alright, Murius.
[236:31.04]It's time for you to get in there because we've got... We've got a creature up here.
[236:37.22]Should I try to be friends with the creature?
[236:39.06]Should I distract the creature?
[236:40.11]What do you think?
[236:46.77]Entertain the creature.
[236:48.39]Kill the other creature.
[236:50.23]Get a rock.
[236:58.26]Another fight right here.
[237:02.32]You can't do that?
[237:02.82]Pick up the small one.
[237:11.28]Edit.
[237:11.80]Pick it up.
[237:12.06]Alright, just get in, just get in, just get in.

[239:42.51]The Greeks mock us with their very existence.
[240:01.36]My Aztec masters will be pleased when I hand them the severed heads of this Greek army.
[240:12.01]How does he get up?
[240:22.50]Fuck.
[240:23.64]I thought I wasn't gonna be able to get it.
[240:25.76]What are they doing?
[240:27.05]Don't get your hands off him.
[240:27.87]Don't touch him.
[240:30.27]He's dead?
[240:30.73]No, he's not dead.

[241:14.74]He's not respawning.
[241:35.54]He's back.
[241:36.24]And he's fatter than ever.
[241:39.87]Perfect!

[256:14.73]We want more breeding.
[256:15.67]Oh, this lady's already pregnant.
[256:17.85]Who's not pregnant?
[256:42.36]Anybody not pregnant?
[256:45.48]I think the whole village is pregnant.
[256:57.41]So fat.

[257:14.23]Isn't that interesting?
[257:18.17]Alright, let's take off your free will for a little bit.
[257:22.63]Come here.
[257:24.01]Will you do what I want you to do and get up here?
[257:30.02]Go up there.
[257:32.62]You can have your free will back, but, like, just get up here.
[257:37.36]Here we go.
[257:37.60]What do we got? 60?
[257:41.39]Ton of people.
[257:42.25]Good.
[257:42.75]This should be enough to break through the front door.
[257:46.52]Prepare a force to destroy these Greek troops.
[257:51.42]No action?
[257:51.86]What do you mean no action?
[257:56.56]The door is open?
[257:57.79]I have to open the door.
[257:58.95]Alright, open the door.
[258:02.85]Ready to go.
[258:10.41]Get up here.
[258:10.87]Fortify up here.
[258:13.03]Stay out of the range of the snipers.
[258:15.31]I gotta get my own snipers.
[258:21.21]Various, get out of the... Okay, get out of the fucking forest.

[259:35.42]Get out of this fucking venue.
[259:38.64]What is going on?
[259:46.23]Did they kill everybody?
[259:48.51]Where's the group that's coming up here?
[259:49.63]Alright, give me the tribute menu.

[260:09.79]Where are they?
[260:27.35]Okay, where the fuck is everybody?
[260:30.38]Oh, here they come.
[260:39.78]That's fine.
[260:40.96]Alright, I have to unlock some of this shit.
[260:45.06]I didn't even realize this was happening here.
[260:48.24]Okay.
[260:48.64]Hand gestures.
[260:49.30]What do I have in tribute?
[260:50.35]256,000?

[261:14.37]There's 60 fucking people here.
[261:15.43]Okay.
[261:15.59]Just stay defending here.
[261:16.93]Don't go anywhere else.
[261:21.63]Hand forcing?
[261:22.57]I don't know what that means.
[261:25.21]Plant market, hovel, statue market, tavern...
[261:30.53]Prison, torture pit.
[261:31.99]Should we just start picking people up and torturing them?
[261:39.06]Drannery.
[261:40.72]This will process the crops your farmers produce.
[261:42.46]Increases the amount of food.
[261:45.52]I mean, I have a lot.
[261:47.04]Drannery.
[261:48.88]There's so many dead bodies.
[261:50.89]Graveyard.
[261:52.15]Shield, miracle.
[261:52.77]What about like fireball or something?
[261:55.69]Advanced soldier.
[261:58.69]The next level of warrior skills for the creature will be more effective and dangerous in combat.
[262:02.13]It'll be harder to hurt.
[262:03.85]Oh yeah, absolutely.
[262:08.55]Fire miracle.
[262:10.64]Burn things.
[262:11.20]Enemies are a good start.
[262:12.16]Get it.
[262:13.68]Nice.
[262:17.16]Alright, let's take a look now.
[262:18.20]Let's get this going.
[262:20.20]Murius now is way better.
[262:24.28]So is this advanced soldier already?
[262:29.51]Where is he?
[262:30.31]Alright, looking good.
[262:33.93]Let's get everybody up here.
[262:37.99]It's time to move in and fight.
[262:40.23]At least try.
[262:41.63]Let's get you guys.
[262:55.99]Alright, come with me.
[263:01.68]I want you all up in the general area.
[263:14.05]Once they're all up in this general area... I want to open the front door.
[263:18.99]This door is open.
[263:21.59]This fucking door is open.
[263:22.87]Let's go in the front door.
[263:23.85]Why are we going in the door that's closed?
[263:25.62]Go in the door that's open.
[263:31.00]Fan Nightbot, what?
[263:39.83]We're going to the door that's open.
[263:47.04]I've got, okay, there's tons of people up here now.
[263:51.73]Let me make a torture pit so we can literally just, when they come in, just pick them up and put them in here and just torture them.
[263:58.09]Right?
[263:58.31]I mean... Let's go.
[264:09.50]Don't even need that much, okay.
[264:16.00]Need ore.
[264:19.12]Alright, so this is done.
[264:19.84]How does this work?
[264:22.72]Just pick somebody up and put them in?
[264:23.70]Is this Mirrius?
[264:29.77]So, do I have to train this, or is Mirrius already leveled up?
[264:32.41]Like the advanced soldier, or do I have to do something about that?
[264:34.59]Do I have to put it somewhere?
[264:40.65]Already upgraded?
[264:41.27]Nice.
[264:41.61]Okay, good.
[264:42.29]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[264:47.43]You can snack on the grain, but don't run in... This door is open.
[264:50.76]We're going to go in the open door.
[264:54.94]Army is here.
[264:55.88]Now... Do I... Don't tear down those walls.
[265:00.13]Just, you know what?
[265:00.77]Stay here.
[265:05.07]Let's get some archers.
[265:17.77]Don't eat a villager.
[265:19.51]Stop eating.
[265:20.27]No, no, no, no.
[265:20.83]Don't eat a villager.
[265:21.81]Are they hitting him?
[265:27.00]Alright, do not eat a villager.
[265:31.36]Here, eat this instead.
[265:35.48]Eat that.
[265:38.68]Yum.
[265:39.98]Eat.
[265:41.32]Yummy.
[265:41.74]Eat!
[265:42.50]Wait, what's going on?
[265:46.03]What are you guys doing?
[265:55.99]What the hell are you guys doing?
[266:00.44]Recruit an army to send against their puny forces.
[266:07.27]Alright.
[266:07.75]Sick.
[266:08.17]Cool.
[266:08.29]Cat sucks.
[266:08.67]I have so many people being bred.
[266:10.55]Alright, I need...
[266:38.21]I need wood.
[266:38.65]We gotta get going.
[266:40.21]I need archers.
[266:45.90]Once that's done, I'm just going in the fucking back door here.
[266:55.16]Not enough?
[266:57.18]What are you talking about?
[266:59.12]Put it in.
[266:59.36]What?
[266:59.50]Did I just throw that?
[267:04.16]Is that gonna be seen as an attack?
[267:07.38]Because I was not ready to attack.
[267:10.56]Is that an attack?
[267:21.86]What in the name of fucking god are you guys doing in this chat?
[267:26.08]What the hell are you doing?
[267:33.97]This is just nonsense.
[267:36.36]It's just absolute fucking nonsense.
[267:40.98]You guys lost your damn minds?
[268:05.72]Wait, wait, wait.
[268:07.10]Is there a creature coming in?
[268:11.47]Who's stomping?
[268:12.13]What are you stomping?
[268:12.93]Stop, stop.
[268:13.39]What are you doing?
[268:13.93]Okay, there's so many soldiers up here.
[268:20.45]Alright, well fucking settle down.
[268:23.61]You guys are making me anxious.
[268:28.90]What the hell is going on over here?
[268:32.94]This is not even, like, typical crack chat night.
[268:34.92]This is just, like, writing random words.
[268:39.89]What the fuck are you doing?
[268:41.27]Hi.
[268:41.87]I need... I can't pick up the archer flag?
[268:56.34]Why not?
[268:56.80]Is that not enough men?
[268:57.50]Not enough ore.
[268:59.86]What the fuck are you talking about?
[269:10.47]How do I not have ore for this?
[269:13.65]Something is currently being taken.
[269:14.95]Okay.
[269:18.40]Um...
[269:43.39]What are you guys doing?
[269:48.30]Alright.

[270:14.11]And keep that shit on.
[270:20.65]See you in two minutes, loser.
[270:22.46]Good use of your two minute sentence.
[270:27.90]Slow-mo doesn't- What the fuck?
[270:33.29]You guys are fucking nuts.
[270:36.99]Alright, this is a video game to play.
[270:42.84]I don't have any soldiers here.
[270:44.80]Is there any soldiers at all?
[270:46.46]How far away is that from Urias?
[270:50.22]We gotta go in.
[270:51.68]I don't care about that town anymore.
[270:52.76]I have fucking a thousand people.
[270:53.88]Let's go.
[270:57.55]I need archers, but I don't know what I need.
[270:59.47]Or a number of troops.
[271:01.07]You can create 14 troops.
[271:02.51]Okay, let's go.
[271:02.81]I can do 14.
[271:06.87]14 archers.
[271:08.11]We gotta go in the front door over here.
[271:10.35]We gotta go in and take the whole thing.
[271:12.51]Save the game here.
[271:41.84]What about the archers on the walls?
[271:44.02]There's only like three right there.
[271:47.30]Can I lease you to like a tree or something?
[271:48.66]Alright, stay over here.
[271:50.84]I'm going to lease you to a big rock.
[271:53.84]Come over here.
[271:55.64]I have to walk the other direction.
[271:56.64]They're going to take that town, but I can literally take over the whole capital.
[272:06.03]This is a long fucking walk.
[272:09.03]God damn it, that's a long walk.
[272:12.74]That's a long walk.
[272:15.92]This door's closed now.
[272:18.25]Shit.
[272:19.71]Reload the game.
[272:20.61]No, it's too late.
[272:28.69]We have to put it on five minutes slow mode?
[272:30.52]Do we actually have to do this?

[276:38.59]Oh my god, why is it so hard?
[276:40.69]Okay, get over here.
[276:42.95]So, the plan here.
[276:44.59]I need to stop whipping fireballs and shit.
[276:52.38]We need spells.
[276:54.54]So, I need to build a... First of all, first of all, first of all, first of all, Murius, come with me.
[276:59.72]Because currently, they're taking over a city.
[277:05.06]We need you to go over here, on your soldier.
[277:09.00]Is it actually just one goddamn person?
[277:13.36]I don't even know, where are they?
[277:44.79]Are they still... Who's taking it?
[277:46.75]Okay, good.
[277:47.50]Okay, very good.
[277:48.30]Let's go ahead and do that again on the other one.
[277:52.70]Okay, good.
[277:53.92]Right.
[277:54.18]Um... Okay.
[278:05.65]Okay.
[278:11.34]You know where this got all fucked up is where I didn't realize that I had to buy the new stuff with Tribute.
[278:16.08]And it's been like... I did it the whole game.
[278:20.52]Where I like the end game.
[278:25.32]Why is chat so slow?
[278:26.64]Because they were unruly.
[278:29.12]And they had to be quelled.
[278:32.00]They had to be stopped.
[278:34.79]Alright, so.
[278:35.17]Uh...
[278:40.37]What do I want to do?
[278:42.35]How do I want to take... How do I want to do this?
[278:43.81]I'm going to have to... I pulled all the troops up here.
[278:46.37]Fuck.
[278:50.18]Alright, I want to... What are they doing?
[278:59.06]Oh, they're putting the fires out.
[279:00.44]These people still... You know what?
[279:02.86]I have to... Oh, yeah, yeah.
[279:04.26]I should have made like three or four saves.
[279:09.47]I'm so far done at this point.
[279:11.05]Like, I'm fucked.
[279:12.92]I need to have rewound, like, an hour and a half.
[279:15.66]And, like, build other buildings.
[279:18.78]Wait, I have to just hurt myself.
[279:20.50]I have to.
[279:22.28]And then just go back from scratch and build buildings.
[279:24.08]I just need to torch it.
[279:25.36]I gotta take out a whole city.
[279:26.38]We gotta torch the city.
[279:27.04]This gotta be done.
[279:37.42]Okay.
[279:44.04]Alright, we have to rebuild from scratch.
[279:52.38]Are we still getting attacked somewhere?
[279:55.00]That top city is going to be under attack.
[279:56.64]Is he alive?
[280:00.36]Alright.
[280:02.45]So this is how to do fire, heal, and now can I just do them in the air like this?
[280:09.25]Do I have to press a certain button?
[280:14.93]Is there, like, an activation thing that I need to do?
[280:16.71]Hmm.
[280:29.09]Alright, yeah, I was gonna say, can we get rid of the guy that just did all caps for, like, the whole paragraph?
[280:33.95]Like, what the fuck are you doing?
[280:46.57]I gotta kill this guy.
[280:47.55]I gotta take this guy out.
[280:49.82]Yeah, there has to be like an activation, right?
[280:54.04]69.
[280:56.50]As long as I keep those people up there, I'm going to... Let's get some archers, but first let me build... I took all the able-bodied men from every community.
[281:11.01]Oh, I royally fucked this all up.
[281:13.05]Let's start some breeding.
[281:14.79]This game is a bit hard.
[281:40.07]I mean, from its very nature, I think it probably is.
[281:42.80]What's going on in there?
[281:44.46]Can we pull all these people out?
[281:45.52]There's a shitload of people in there.
[281:47.78]What are you guys all doing in here?
[281:53.32]20 worshippers?
[281:55.80]No, no, get out.
[281:56.58]Get out of here.
[281:57.12]How do I get them out?
[282:01.30]Guys, guys, guys, you gotta... We got shit to do.
[282:04.13]It's all women.
[282:10.17]I fucked up the whole Earth's population.
[282:12.29]I sent every man to war.
[282:14.15]There's no men!
[282:28.28]I fucked up all of Earth.
[282:30.61]Wait, a man!
[282:33.69]That's a man right?
[282:40.11]Okay, we're good.
[282:45.55]Now I need... How do I do those gestures, though?
[282:55.24]Okay, ranged armory.
[282:58.46]His shit is so much more advanced than mine is right now.
[283:18.70]Is chat really this bored?
[283:20.48]I have no idea apparently apparently But whatever that's just the way it is apparently Disciple
[283:46.37]Chat loves slow-mo.
[283:47.69]They like to talk about how much it's their favorite thing.
[283:53.57]Jerma, please turn up and that person.
[283:55.13]I'm not even kidding for like at least 10 minutes.
[283:56.27]Where are they all going?
[284:03.00]Disciple breeder.
[284:09.86]They mobilize for war.
[284:13.68]I put all my eggs in one basket and that basket was wrong.
[284:24.35]And he's so much stronger than me.
[284:28.37]How much do I have for... One man?
[284:35.83]Wait.
[284:37.15]I can spawn a man.
[284:50.67]I want one.
[284:52.83]Give me like two.
[284:59.31]Alrighty.
[285:05.94]Chat is very problematic.
[285:07.56]Yeah, what's going on today?
[285:12.55]What is going on today?
[285:15.89]Are you guys all collectively like... huffing fucking glue?
[285:25.34]Like what are you guys doing?
[285:38.74]You wouldn't understand.
[285:42.34]Oh my god.
[285:43.46]What the fuck?
[285:57.59]Anyways, I'm going to continue to pay attention to the video game.
[286:01.41]Because that's what I'm doing!
[286:03.03]Throwing rocks!
[286:05.59]Did it work?
[286:08.29]Alright, we're gonna start throwing fireballs.
[286:10.27]That's the plan.
[286:11.81]Furious, get up here.
[286:16.75]I need to build a... We're gonna close this out here.
[286:19.85]We're gonna close this one out good.
[286:21.93]I need a... One of these things.
[286:24.38]An altar up here.
[286:28.18]With an altar, I can just... I'm gonna just whip bombs across the gate.
[286:32.34]And then we're going in.
[286:44.69]Make it emote only?
[286:47.27]Actually, you know what?
[286:48.79]Do it.
[286:49.61]No, actually, no, don't do that.
[286:51.45]That's just, when they come out of it, they're going to be even worse.
[286:54.77]You know how that works?
[286:56.71]It's like you're putting a muzzle on somebody, and then they just go, I'm going to build up all my screams for when this muzzle comes up.
[287:05.34]And then the muzzle, yeah, it's just not going to work.
[287:13.63]Just never take it off.
[287:15.77]That's so bad.
[287:17.69]That's so bad.
[287:21.20]We went better than this.
[287:23.12]We shouldn't have to do that.
[287:24.64]We shouldn't have to do that.
[287:25.68]We went better than this.
[287:27.56]Oh, man.
[287:28.38]Aww.
[287:33.65]No, no, no, no.
[287:36.49]Don't go in.
[287:37.03]Don't go in.
[287:37.45]Stay right here.
[287:44.43]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[287:45.77]You're gonna get shot with arrows.
[287:47.61]First things first.
[287:48.74]Get everyone ready.
[287:54.58]Let's torch their whole city.
[287:56.56]I know you're angry.
[287:57.28]I know you're angry.
[287:57.86]You're angry.
[287:58.26]I know.
[288:00.70]Here we go.
[288:03.16]Hungry?
[288:03.56]Go eat something first.
[288:05.34]Let's burn it down.
[288:10.10]Boom.
[288:12.12]Burn their city to the ground.
[288:18.85]Torch.
[288:21.63]Boom.
[288:22.45]Destroy it.
[288:26.12]Fire.
[288:27.04]Fire into the... Watch this one.
[288:29.62]I'm just going to drop this fireball right on the door.
[288:33.88]Right there.
[288:36.26]Boom.
[288:42.30]Slow mode on Twitch has an upper limit.
[288:43.70]I think it's like 30 minutes.
[288:44.96]I really think it is.
[288:50.09]Shit, I hit the wall.
[288:51.11]Alright, is it time to go in?
[288:52.31]They don't have any fighters.
[288:54.93]Why are the intruders here?
[288:58.08]What do they hope to gain?
[288:59.30]Um, Murius, what the fuck are you doing?
[289:02.18]Murius, what are you doing?
[289:03.92]No, stop, stop.
[289:04.62]Why are you fucking fighting yourself?
[289:07.30]Is this the leash?
[289:10.09]He's just so angry.
[289:12.03]Stay, stay, stay, stay.
[289:12.75]Stop, stop.
[289:13.23]What are you thinking?
[289:15.71]The mighty Aztec onslaught.
[289:20.46]He's just going in.
[289:21.89]I can't stop him.
[289:23.03]He's the embodiment of chat right now.
[289:24.77]He's just going in.
[289:25.39]Can I break the door down with this?
[289:39.95]I wonder. ...
[289:51.51]It might be time to go in.
[290:07.36]It's an allegory for your power in black and white.
[290:12.71]What happened to all my friends?
[290:15.43]Wait, who?
[290:19.53]Perfect shot.
[290:22.87]Alright, let's drop a bomb right here and let's try to get in the front door.
[290:25.75]I'm going in with... Let's see if I can hit it.
[290:30.97]Come on.
[290:33.55]Alright, time to go in.
[290:34.23]This is the opportunity.
[290:36.18]Mirrius, I need you.
[290:39.84]To be on soldier mode.
[290:41.48]They don't have any more archers, so that's good.
[290:44.48]Break the fucking door down.
[290:45.30]Let's go.
[290:48.52]We're supposed to bring balance to the force, not destroy it!
[290:53.25]I don't care, Lester.
[290:57.15]We're going to send these guys.
[291:03.05]Where do I capture?
[291:04.95]Where's the thing to capture?
[291:09.75]Attack?
[291:11.63]Where is it?
[291:12.01]Right there.
[291:13.61]Hidden.
[291:18.71]Mirrius, why have you stopped hitting the door?
[291:24.11]Mirrius.
[291:25.69]Mirrius.
[291:25.95]The door.
[291:29.03]Mirrius, the door.
[291:31.08]Yeah, the door.
[291:32.04]Mirrius, the door.
[291:33.80]Mirrius, the door.
[291:37.36]Mirrius, the door.
[291:41.40]Mirrius, the door.
[291:45.61]Mirrius, the door.
[291:50.22]Murius.
[291:51.98]The door, if you please.
[292:01.26]Good.
[292:01.96]Excellent work, my son.
[292:04.32]Watch it.
[292:18.65]Capture it.
[292:19.63]Murius, you have to deal with the other god.
[292:25.07]You can do it.
[292:25.61]You're supposed to be super strong.
[292:27.66]Alright.
[292:29.70]Alright, alright, alright.
[292:30.76]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[292:32.08]Everybody run.
[292:32.60]Everybody run, run, run.
[292:34.12]Everybody in.
[292:34.52]Everybody in.
[292:34.86]Everybody in.
[292:35.38]In, in, in, in, in.
[292:37.44]In, in.
[292:39.40]Capture.
[292:47.83]Holy shit!
[292:48.53]Oh my god!
[292:49.43]This is how he's destroying it!
[292:51.18]Holy shit!
[292:51.54]Take the town over, that was pure fucking rage!
[293:20.35]That was rage.
[293:21.21]Total fucking rage.
[293:22.13]Get it, get it!
[293:22.53]Fight, fight, fight!
[293:23.25]Mirrius, be careful in here, Mirrius!
[293:24.53]Mirrius, be careful in here!
[293:53.72]Okay, alright, Mirri, attack the archers.
[293:55.42]You're gonna be the block.
[294:01.57]Can we get it?
[294:06.59]Fire.
[294:07.31]Oh, where?
[294:12.05]Oh my fucking god, where is the stupid building?
[294:15.28]What are the gestures, for the love of god?
[294:30.99]Where's the... We need you guys to stay alive.
[294:37.05]Start killing.
[294:37.57]We can take it in a second.
[294:46.46]You punched that guy to dust.
[294:51.84]God, how am I going to capture this shit?
[294:54.16]They keep pouring people out.
[294:58.89]Alright, we're doing 55 fucking men.
[295:01.75]Let's hope I can get them out there in time.
[295:05.73]Mirrus, what are you doing?
[295:11.19]Where are you going?
[295:14.35]Mirrus, stop fucking hitting that shit and go over and help them.
[295:23.41]Oh, fuck.
[295:26.14]Why are you pinning the wall, Murius, of all the things to hit?
[295:30.22]Why would you do the wall?
[295:33.16]There's a guy sitting right here.
[295:35.77]Get on top of him and beat his head into the ground.
[295:37.79]Do it.
[295:39.31]Kick his ass.
[295:39.81]Kick his ass.
[295:42.71]Get on top of him.
[295:44.61]Do it.
[295:50.07]Good.
[295:50.31]Good.
[295:50.85]Good.
[295:52.62]Good.
[296:02.89]capture no stop going to the wall man he wants to destroy the wall so bad we're so close to winning
[296:29.54]Who's left?
[296:31.72]I don't see anybody.
[296:33.56]Just get everybody on here and take it over.
[296:40.36]I think I win.
[296:40.82]They're taking this, but it's not going to be enough.
[296:42.80]I got their capital right here.
[297:00.88]Alright, Mirrius, go ahead and take the walls down if you really want to.
[297:12.79]Maybe he should just go... No, because the... He's going to wake up.
[297:23.34]And I have to get back on top of him and punch his face until he's dead again.
[297:25.70]Let's give him a round.
[297:39.10]Who's clipping their nails in the background?
[297:41.92]It does kind of sound like that, right?
[297:43.12]Raise morale.
[297:45.12]Take this shit over.
[297:45.82]I'm a little out of breath.
[297:53.15]Here he comes.
[297:57.59]Alright, when he respawns, just do it again instantly.
[298:01.77]There he is.
[298:05.87]They're raining death down upon us.
[298:12.83]Get him, get him.
[298:14.51]No, you're getting stuck on a building, you fucking idiot.
[298:18.65]He's getting stuck on a building.
[298:23.62]Get him.
[298:25.36]Yep, get him.
[298:26.82]Yep, yep, yep.
[298:34.21]Alright, he got a couple of shots and that's okay.
[298:37.01]More than one.
[298:37.65]Alright.
[298:38.19]You're good.
[298:39.01]Just... Here he is.
[298:41.29]Here he is.
[298:41.67]Here he is.
[298:42.75]Here he is.
[298:45.75]Get on top of him.
[298:46.87]Get on top of him and feed his fucking headache.
[298:49.21]Get on top of him.
[299:00.62]Elbow drop.
[299:15.99]I win.
[299:21.63]I thought he was gonna elbow drop him.
[299:24.43]Eat him!
[299:25.89]That's fine.
[299:40.01]Being a new viewer is a weird experience.
[299:49.34]I was just like spam for like 30 minutes.
[299:59.89]My lights are on.
[300:00.47]We already went over this.
[300:02.25]My lights are turned on.
[300:04.75]It's my exposure is lower because I start screaming during the day.
[300:16.70]Good.
[300:26.08]Kick it.
[300:32.58]I'm gonna use my two minutes on an Omega Lull.
[300:36.08]Now that's a good use.
[300:36.92]That's good use.
[300:38.42]Pick this person up and just throw.
[300:59.01]My people bow low before the Greeks.
[301:04.45]Their brutality knows no equal, not even the Aztecs.
[301:10.89]We respect this power, this strength, but will the Japanese and will our rulers, the Aztecs?
[301:21.11]I wonder if the old prophecy is true.
[301:23.97]If the Greeks are the weak race brought to strength by a god.
[301:29.96]If so, will they fulfill the next chapter and go to Honshai, where their separated Greek brethren wait for them?
[301:37.88]Did Murius get buffed?
[301:40.70]No.
[301:41.62]He got fat.
[301:42.94]He died.
[301:45.36]Well, he got incapacitated twice and apparently had a bunch of food in his stomach.
[301:56.83]Should I just have him build a few houses?
[301:58.95]We gotta go back to free will.
[302:00.67]I'm gonna lose free will here.
[302:01.53]Look at how bad that looks.
[302:08.64]It's like a zipper.
[302:09.54]Alright, hell yeah.
[302:12.64]I did it.
[302:14.50]Are you sure you wish to leave the land?
[302:17.30]Click again to confirm.
[302:24.32]Leader, I've been hearing rumors that some more of our people survived the Aztec volcanoes.
[302:31.48]Some elite archers managed to fight their way clear after we left.
[302:35.97]We need to find them.
[302:37.29]We need all the elite troops we can get.
[302:40.33]We need everyone we can get.
[302:42.35]Archers or not, they're on another land.
[302:46.17]We must go and find them.
[302:48.27]Yeah, archers.
[302:49.60]What are we waiting for?
[303:00.05]Alright, 20.
[303:00.83]Yeah, that was a little bit of an evil level.
[303:07.91]Creature.
[303:09.09]32% evil.
[303:09.69]Age?
[303:10.55]3.
[303:12.60]He's now 7 feet tall.
[303:15.40]Fatness.
[303:16.20]The lightest he was today was 592 pounds.
[303:17.76]And now he's 2400 pounds.
[303:18.74]That's like a car.
[303:29.38]Fitness is actually not bad.
[303:30.80]Hit points.
[303:34.24]Final 45, because the number of bowel movements is 54.
[303:38.58]167 kills.
[303:41.67]Grain and villagers.
[303:43.17]Alright, we can do some miracles next time.
[303:51.91]A little evil, it's okay.
[303:53.67]Not full-blown evil.
[303:56.47]Water field, water forest, build a wall, use creature rolls.
[304:00.53]Undead legion, nut oil.
[304:01.89]What is nut oil?
[304:04.05]Undead legion and win the land.
[304:05.46]What's undead legion?
[304:09.40]Impressiveness.
[304:10.26]It was okay.
[304:11.62]My vitals.
[304:12.68]Alright, we're good.
[304:14.64]We saved the game.
[304:15.32]Real wink?
[304:15.75]You got it.
[304:26.80]This place doesn't look so bad.
[304:28.88]We should be able to take it over with a little... Great!
[304:31.48]More warfare!
[304:32.78]This is what makes my blood tingle!
[304:34.93]But if you're impressive, you don't need to win through bloodshed.
[304:39.19]Because you win without having to fight.
[304:42.11]There doesn't seem to be any opposition.
[304:44.21]And look!
[304:45.53]The missing arches.
[304:46.47]There's a lot of people right here.
[304:59.97]Mega Man 2 is better than black and white and pink.
[305:12.54]What?
[305:13.08]Watch this!
[305:13.70]Another portal!
[305:14.70]What does that belong to?
[305:17.36]The rumors of the Greeks' return are true.
[305:20.48]My brother has sent me to make this island safe.
[305:23.82]This I will do.
[305:27.54]Sounds like a tribal commander, boss.
[305:30.00]We'd better start building now.
[305:32.24]These Japanese seem to be formidable builders themselves.
[305:36.12]And get some armies, boss.
[305:37.96]They look pretty handy at fighting as well.
[305:43.39]That's a pretty sick nerf combat vest.
[305:47.51]That's probably the best boy I've seen described.
[305:51.25]Now that's nice, boss.
[305:53.01]Real nice.
[305:54.49]But, what is it?
[305:55.67]I'm going to play with that toy.
[305:57.43]What do you think about the toy?
[305:58.80]It's got a lot of armies.
[306:18.47]I have to build a wall?
[306:21.03]I don't even have a creature den.
[306:22.35]Alright, we gotta start with the most important bit first.
[306:25.27]Okay.
[306:25.95]Alright, let me do the test.
[306:49.53]hey hey oh I can't I need to unlock forcing okay get some sleep by the trees yeah uh let me I gotta build some first let's build let's get a storeroom back here let's put it uh there's a bunch of trees over here let's put it right here
[307:15.58]They're planning to store for the future.
[307:18.22]This conflict will not have a speedy resolution.
[307:23.84]Clear this out.
[307:25.94]Uh, he just threw somebody.
[307:31.82]A warring nation needs resources, and this storehouse will be full of them.
[307:37.28]You're a little late, Murius, but good try.
[307:39.68]There, they will store enough to keep the fallen of this conflict alive for years to come.
[307:46.28]Okay, let's get tons of huge.
[307:49.32]I mean, like, just a stupid amount.
[307:52.74]Oops.
[307:53.64]Okay, now let's get a... 71 people can work on there.
[308:06.09]I taught him that.
[308:06.93]I didn't mean to.
[308:09.53]Let's drop this in here because it's ore.
[308:11.53]It's free ore.

[340:41.15]Hold button down and shake left and right.
[340:51.42]I saw the smoke.
[340:56.56]You need to work harder to harness the awesome power of Chi.
[341:01.37]You may try again when you feel ready, student.
[341:24.82]I don't even know what this game is wanting me to do Like oh you can interact with the world but shake until there's smoke it doesn't say that

[342:54.17]Dead people in the streets.
[342:56.49]Empty towns.
[342:57.17]Yeah, this has nothing to do with it.
[343:03.31]Slide between all three rocks.
[343:15.56]When I was sitting here going up and down like this, there was a ring that was appearing underneath it.
[343:20.07]Tapping is definitely not it.
[343:21.97]When I was doing this last time, it actually worked.
[343:53.01]I haven't changed anything.
[343:57.18]You must work harder, student.

[345:45.19]You basically can't stop shaking for a second or you'll fail.
[345:50.45]Ah!
[346:01.04]You need to work harder to harness the awesome power of Chi.
[346:05.85]You may try again when you feel ready, student.

[346:20.14]This is the strangest video game mechanic I've ever seen.
[346:34.32]You must work harder student.
[347:15.58]Just repeatedly punch?
[347:17.00]You need to work harder to harness the awesome power of Chi.

[348:16.08]Shake it as violently as you can.
[348:30.55]Good work.
[348:31.75]You received tribute.
[348:35.71]Well, I don't care about the tribute.
[348:36.79]I'm just glad that I've got real estate now.
[348:40.27]Imagine trusting me like that.
[348:42.09]The tunnel will allow our hardworking people to relax and... Say it again.
[348:53.73]Hold on, I need to... Okay, cavern.
[349:01.08]Is the game loud for you guys?
[349:02.56]It's loud for me.

[349:15.51]He's still gathering?
[349:17.75]Alright, he's gonna hate me for this.
[349:21.57]He doesn't want to gather forever.
[349:24.13]Drinking weakens the senses of both builders and strategists.
[349:28.70]What do we need?
[349:31.10]We have food, more food.
[349:35.14]I got, okay.

[349:46.13]That's fine.
[349:46.71]Water.
[349:55.26]What did I just do?
[350:00.24]Food is now not an issue anymore.

[350:19.31]Heal miracle.
[350:22.22]Lightning miracle.
[350:23.08]75,000?
[350:23.34]Should I give him lightning again like he used to?
[350:25.70]He loved lightning before.
[350:33.27]He's getting it.
[350:33.71]Alright, what else can I do?
[350:36.43]Rest home?
[350:37.29]Lumber mill.
[350:37.87]That's what I want.
[350:40.49]What are we doing on props?
[350:49.32]More.
[350:50.18]Good.
[350:51.70]We need houses?
[350:52.34]Are we actually having children born now?
[350:59.01]Happiness bonus.

[351:05.65]There's 12 breeders.
[351:08.31]How are there no kids?
[351:09.14]177 adults.
[351:18.97]Are we full?
[351:19.79]Do we need more homes?
[351:34.94]Alright, I'm doing them.
[351:36.16]Okay, I'm going to do them over here.
[351:37.66]We're going to have another street over here.
[352:00.65]You're in the boring suburbs?
[352:02.31]Oh, we gotta make sure we hit all these.
[352:27.84]Alright, let's go.
[352:32.14]This game is so much fun.
[352:57.87]How are we doing on... I want to take this mission very, very, very slow.
[353:09.82]You know?
[353:13.08]I want to make sure we're prepared.
[353:14.85]And I'm going to use diplomacy first.
[353:17.11]Not fireballs.
[353:17.95]Not mounting somebody and punching them in the face until they're dead.
[353:22.45]Diplomacy.
[353:26.86]Alright, we need to go over here.
[353:32.18]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, awh!

[354:19.43]Look at all this food.
[354:20.23]Murius, you're done.
[354:22.07]Please, cease what you're doing.
[354:24.21]Be an entertainer.
[354:28.27]Just hang out in the middle of the town.
[354:29.67]We'll entertain our new friends.
[354:34.63]Entertain the new friends.
[354:38.92]Look at new friends.
[354:45.66]Yes, there they are.
[354:47.98]Yes.
[354:48.60]Look at his haircut.
[354:54.27]Why does Miriam have this haircut?
[355:00.99]What do we need?
[355:04.42]I think everything's doing great.
[355:11.37]That leads us to over here.
[355:13.41]Got a lot of space.
[355:14.35]What do we do?
[355:19.90]Another storehouse down here?
[355:25.98]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[355:27.48]Storehouse down here.
[355:28.46]No, I can't.
[355:28.90]I don't own this yet.
[355:29.90]I'm going to put something up here.
[355:34.16]Storehouse up here.
[355:35.36]And then a farm.
[355:38.40]Storehouse up.
[355:39.95]No.
[355:40.03]What do I want?
[355:41.03]I want a... What do I want to do?
[355:42.67]Armory?
[355:43.37]Armory.
[355:48.23]Yep.
[355:48.45]I got some space down here, too.
[355:49.79]Okay.
[355:50.15]Armory's going down here.
[355:53.51]And then a ranged armory.
[355:55.85]Good.
[355:56.41]Is there even a mine?
[355:58.53]I don't see a mine anywhere.
[356:11.55]Doing diplomacy?
[356:12.41]I am, but just in case.
[356:13.29]I also need more borders.
[356:17.59]Just in case.
[356:28.12]It should take me pretty high up.
[356:29.50]There it is.
[356:30.26]Very good.
[356:30.62]Is there a mine anywhere?
[356:42.60]Mine?
[356:42.92]Is that a mine?
[356:43.90]Mine right here.
[356:44.60]Okay.
[356:46.24]I got to build up this way.
[356:50.43]Keep entertaining.
[356:52.73]We need it right now.
[356:57.73]Look at all these kids that are coming in.
[356:58.87]We need more houses because we're going to have a ton of kids coming in.
[357:04.81]Get rid of this.
[357:07.29]Don't throw that all the way.
[357:08.37]I got to eventually build this.
[357:11.69]More houses.
[357:14.10]Mansions?
[357:14.50]I'm going to invest in mansions.
[357:17.84]I have 15,000.
[357:18.54]Maybe a well.
[357:30.25]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[357:33.35]He bought.
[357:35.57]Plant market.
[357:39.06]Plant market.

[357:43.83]But I'm putting it in town.
[357:47.47]Like, you sell plants.
[357:53.88]We now have a market.
[357:59.32]We Japanese are traders and builders at heart.
[358:04.04]Armies, combining forces.
[358:05.32]Leash platoons of swordsmen to platoons of archers, as one would protect the other.
[358:08.94]Good to know.
[358:11.11]Platoons at rest will automatically regen health.
[358:12.95]Good.
[358:14.41]Okay.
[358:14.93]We need more houses.
[358:15.65]We need some ore.
[358:25.40]He's getting huge.
[358:25.98]Yeah, he is.
[358:29.91]Cool.
[358:30.81]We're starting to continue development over here.
[358:46.37]I'm gonna start running out of trees.
[358:47.47]Alright.
[358:51.01]Houses.
[358:52.13]More houses.
[359:02.80]House.
[359:04.94]Keep it going.
[359:12.08]I want an insane population.
[359:15.75]Because I want to be able to train like 5,000 troops if I need to.
[359:20.65]That's good for now.
[359:21.31]We'll do the other side.
[359:21.99]I can get a road there.
[359:34.10]It's okay.
[359:40.26]You don't want to be on the same street as everybody.
[359:54.81]Alright.
[359:56.53]What, what, what?
[359:57.01]Ignoring?
[359:57.41]Horrible city planning?
[359:59.87]Why?
[360:00.53]There's two different... This town is ugly.
[360:07.31]This takes place in like... 6 BC!
[360:27.59]Why are they all so pissed?
[360:34.83]Watch out!
[360:39.05]We now have a market.
[360:40.19]Why do they have to say it?
[360:42.51]Hey, just want to let you know, we got a market now.
[360:58.28]Oh, so do I. This should be good on population for a while.
[361:12.11]Finally, I got, like, a good starting point here.
[361:14.25]There's too much grass in this village.
[361:26.33]I don't have cement.
[361:27.85]Yeah.
[361:27.95]Oh, shit.
[361:28.33]Here they come!
[361:28.83]See?
[361:28.95]We don't even need violence.
[361:30.51]We just have this bustling city.
[361:32.85]See?
[361:33.01]I told you we were going to use diplomacy this time.
[362:00.21]I told you.
[362:11.35]Why have fun when you can plant trees?
[362:16.40]That is fun.
[362:16.82]Alright, what's wrong?
[362:18.64]We need food?
[362:20.28]What's the population?

[370:46.76]We need people to be over here.
[370:50.38]Um...
[370:54.94]Okay, we need miners now.
[370:57.96]Who wants to go mine over there?
[370:59.19]I need influence over here.
[371:01.35]I can't even send anybody there.
[371:03.23]Is there a different mine?
[371:03.89]I don't have access to a mine, don't I?
[371:10.43]Another town chooses the honorable path of Japanese enlightenment.
[371:15.60]It's not a mine?
[371:16.56]Oh, no, I did build it.
[371:22.46]This... Oh!

[372:02.36]I need some of you guys to be... Oh, they're all just going in random directions.
[372:08.94]They have a place to live?
[372:22.86]Can I put you in the mine?
[372:23.78]I'm quick enough.
[372:31.10]I just threw him.
[372:31.74]I was trying to click him.
[372:35.59]I'm sorry.
[372:37.07]I was trying to get him into the mine.
[372:42.33]Is this a mine?
[372:42.91]No.
[372:50.34]I have to build something right here.
[372:52.27]How about a... Another storehouse up here.
[372:58.39]Good to me.
[373:01.61]Then we'll have the farm here, more trees and a mine.
[373:08.78]You cowards don't even smoke crack.
[373:10.86]Nobody should smoke crack.
[373:11.90]Not even you.
[373:19.36]Trump hair.
[373:20.06]I can't even get over it.
[373:21.16]Trump hair.

[374:55.42]Graveyard can be up here.
[374:57.20]Or over here.
[374:59.40]Graveyard's gonna go over here.
[375:00.80]This is like a fine place to work back here.
[375:02.32]Okay, good.

[377:07.85]Fucking none.
[377:08.45]700 is something I have to finish building over here, right?

[386:21.75]So now this is where I make 700 people in the military and just walk in a straight line and kill everybody.
[386:31.01]Look at their base.
[386:34.75]That's nothing.
[386:36.68]This is nothing.
[386:37.82]Where's your creature?

[386:40.79]Lame.
[386:40.97]Wow, fucking lame.
[386:41.99]You don't even have a creature.
[386:43.95]This'll be easy.
[387:08.43]So, how are we doing?
[387:09.21]Let's check.
[387:09.75]Alright, let's do a checkup.
[387:10.77]People are fucking angry!
[387:14.09]There are 300 males to 160 females?
[387:14.67]Should I make 160 soldiers?
[387:15.19]Why are they... What do you mean?
[387:15.79]Why?
[387:15.87]Should I make like 100 soldiers and just put them up?
[387:38.17]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[387:39.29]Keep going with the plan.
[387:40.71]The plan is to put some more houses up this way.
[387:43.21]I'm building out.
[387:45.17]How much tribute do I have?
[387:46.10]A lot.
[387:46.94]A rest home.
[387:50.22]Oldies, crumblies.

[388:12.27]Yeah, right here.
[388:12.75]This is fine.
[388:13.73]This would be like the 55 plus community.
[388:15.23]It's true.
[388:32.25]Old zone?
[388:32.85]Yeah, this is where they all want to hang out.
[388:34.65]This is where the 55 plus community is.
[388:40.15]This should be good.
[388:46.72]I'm fucking addicted to this game.
[388:54.02]Respect for the elderly and infirm is a true sign of strength.
[389:03.46]Hold the second one.
[389:07.06]Good.
[389:09.92]So, are we able now?

[390:16.36]It's a lumber mill.
[390:16.96]That is really loud.
[390:20.74]I'll do it down here.
[390:22.00]There's nothing over here.
[390:34.03]Wood is precious, and this lumber mill is so efficient.
[390:43.91]Chest.
[390:44.25]I'm gonna have to do some adjustments to the boomer brace here.

[391:04.02]Shitload of ore.
[391:05.32]Did I build something else down here?
[391:06.42]I'm losing track.
[391:12.05]Wasn't there something else I constructed?
[391:13.21]I guess not.
[391:14.65]Not yet.
[391:14.91]Alright, just put it back.
[391:19.17]Ore.

[391:31.85]Granary complete.
[391:33.08]Lumber mill complete.
[391:34.16]More material for their constructions.
[391:38.66]How is this evil?

[416:53.67]I don't.
[416:54.43]Like, really at all.
[416:57.48]But that's okay.

[418:17.27]Alright, let's go.
[418:17.97]Capture it.
[418:24.48]Wasn't there a way I could make the archers support the group?
[418:30.81]A thousand came and a thousand left.
[418:32.27]Oh, that's interesting.
[418:41.93]They got snapped out.
[418:44.11]It's captured by force.
[418:52.63]I don't want Murius to see this.
[418:53.86]I don't want him to see.
[419:07.95]Oh, minus 500 food.
[419:10.03]So there's this town here.
[419:12.55]I'm going to wrap around this town here.
[419:15.89]I want to get this town first.
[419:18.90]So we're going to come back.
[419:19.98]Actually, we should have gone this way first.
[419:21.04]Dammit.
[419:22.08]Ah!
[419:26.36]Alright, that's alright.
[419:28.14]Build a wonder.
[419:32.03]Mysterious.
[419:34.89]We're actually probably going to be calling it a night here soon and resuming tomorrow afternoon.
[419:40.99]I'm still into this game.
[419:41.79]I still want to play it.
[419:48.07]Close the gate now.
[419:50.57]Yeah, it's not a bad idea.
[419:56.10]Did he really bring over... He brought over... He brought over, like, 20 food.
[420:07.85]Into the stream voice, yeah.
[420:09.93]Yeah, we've been going for like seven hours.
[420:11.29]Probably time to wind it down a little bit.
[420:15.03]I gotta get some food.
[420:15.73]There's only two lands after this one, and then the expansion.
[420:23.89]Yeah, I'm just, it's just fun to play.
[420:26.05]I'm just having a good time.
[420:27.65]And tomorrow, maybe we'll just play for a little bit, see if I'm still into it, and then move on to something else.
[420:40.92]So, after I take this over, that's probably what we're going to call it.
[420:45.22]Seven exact hours.
[420:54.78]So, we save it.
[420:57.96]Mega Man confirmed?
[421:02.53]No.
[421:04.01]Mega Man not confirmed.
[421:05.09]Alright, we got this town.
[421:08.99]I'm going to... Okay, here we go.
[421:12.04]This is a good place to start tomorrow.
[421:17.10]Yeah.
[421:17.86]Hell yeah.
[421:18.90]Alright.
[421:19.82]Yeah, we'll call it here.
[421:22.89]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[421:23.89]We're going to start with this.
[421:26.89]And then after this, depending on how much I'm still into it after three, four plus hours, we'll see what we want to do.
[421:37.86]Thanks for watching.
[421:39.62]See you tomorrow.
[421:41.54]Have a wonderful day.
[421:43.50]He's gonna play Rain World.
[421:49.36]I don't know.
[421:50.86]That's not determined yet.
[421:54.20]We'll see you tomorrow, though.
[422:01.85]Let's get to the bits.
[422:03.07]Let me make sure I can get out of this game.
[422:06.29]It's not gonna crash on me.
[422:07.31]Okay, we're good.
[422:13.12]Alright.
[422:21.08]Uh, the game crashed.
[422:22.46]Let's hope that's not a bad sign.
[422:23.61]I saved it.
[422:27.01]Oh, there we go, we're good.
[422:32.97]Thank you for joining me on the Moocrew.
[422:36.40]Let's go back seven hours ago.
[422:37.62]To the beginning of the stream.
[422:41.73]We had Potion Dweller for 250.
[422:43.27]Thank you, Potion Dweller.
[422:45.21]With the tragic news of winks going away, we will activate a day of retaliation, spending all our wink points on the very last day.
[422:51.67]I forgot what day that is, so please restate.
[422:55.53]Uh... As of... Let's see.
[423:02.55]Streaming tomorrow.
[423:04.61]As of...
[423:10.65]Thursday, the 27th of February.
[423:13.37]We're gonna change Winx to something else.
[423:17.41]We're gonna change it, we're gonna freshen it up a little bit.
[423:20.65]There's your official date.
[423:22.09]Dude, are you fucking serious?
[423:27.54]Oh fuck, oh god, oh no no fuck.
[423:31.02]I didn't even get to use one!
[423:33.00]That was the problem, it was gonna be this never-ending cycle.
[423:36.00]Of people trying to build enough, and people that have built enough.
[423:39.50]So, we want- we'll do something more- more interesting than a wink.
[423:43.50]A wink is just like, Eh, eh, eh, wink, turn it off.
[423:47.36]Plus, I can go back to being naked, and that's great- that's good for me.
[423:54.52]That's good for me.
[423:56.81]There you go, this is the last day for winks.
[424:00.41]Hopefully the next thing I do is something... Do a foot cam?
[424:04.67]I don't think I'm gonna do a foot cam.
[424:13.31]This blew me away, yep.
[424:26.52]Yes, you can.
[424:28.20]Black and white, one.
[424:28.82]You can do that, too.
[424:29.38]You can scoop up the pixelated.
[424:31.64]It's really cool.
[424:33.31]It was before Half-Life.
[424:34.33]Before Half-Life 2 did it.
[424:39.45]Do it five minutes of Bugleberry.
[424:40.93]That would be so bad.
[424:48.16]I can't do that.
[424:50.62]This game was not meant for children.
[424:52.06]This game was meant for gods.
[425:23.44]Everything has to be a children's game.
[425:25.10]Okay, what is a non-children's game?
[425:27.60]I'm curious.
[425:30.18]It seems like, oh man, you can't even play this children's game.
[425:32.34]Look at this children's game.
[425:33.28]What's a non-children's game?
[425:37.45]What would be in that category?
[425:42.67]Dark Souls?
[425:44.25]Okay, what about besides Dark Souls?
[425:47.27]Nancy Drew and Nancy Drew is a children's game.
[425:49.41]I'm sorry.
[425:58.12]porn games okay well that's hey sam freelance police thanks to the 250 hi Jerma I made a lo-fi song using using your my father was a wealthy man monolog I dedicated it to my dad for his 50th birthday it's a bit long but I hope you can share it during a community night also it's my birthday on the 24th do something fun and I'll bring a cake well what a perfect opportunity to have us announce the next community night

[427:03.19]This... Yeah.
[427:07.03]There's a ton of submissions.
[427:08.62]There's a lot of submissions.
[427:09.64]You guys have been putting in so much stuff.
[427:18.04]Community Crack Night.
[427:19.08]No, that wasn't even today.
[427:20.89]And by the way, let me... What the hell was going on today?
[427:23.21]What was going on today?
[427:25.11]Okay.
[427:28.57]I look over at the chat room and people are just going crazy.
[427:36.25]People were going nuts.
[427:42.85]It was just like just spam for like 30 minutes.
[427:49.04]I understand spam is fun.
[427:50.24]Spam can be fun.
[427:52.80]But I'm not sure there was one comment
[427:56.48]but anything that we were doing it was just like copypastas and people screaming at each other and we got we gotta hit we gotta hit way omega low cringe community who cares game sucks the game what how how could you say that
[428:27.96]Some of you guys have been fucking seeing red.
[428:31.30]It was a wink?
[428:34.30]Oh, get up, don't worry, don't worry.
[428:39.93]It was just, it was messy.
[428:42.75]And it was going so fast, too, that's the thing.
[428:45.25]It's not even about, oh, wow, there's some spam.
[428:47.51]Oh, it was 100 miles per hour.
[428:49.74]It was just crazy.
[429:07.56]This is what it's like for you now.
[429:11.32]It's not a community, it's chat.
[429:16.14]It's alright, though.
[429:17.10]I just... Worst stream 2020?
[429:23.88]What are you talking about?
[429:25.44]I, like, had a ton of fun playing.
[429:28.33]What?
[429:30.59]They were non-subs?
[429:31.93]I don't believe that for a second.
[429:33.31]I saw some subscribers in there throwing mud at each other.
[429:37.93]This game's fucking hilarious and fun and interesting.
[429:43.33]What are you talking about?
[429:45.20]Oh, worse chat experience.
[429:46.30]I see.
[429:46.60]Well, put it on the list.
[429:47.38]Put it on the list.
[429:54.80]Put it on six-month sub mode.
[429:58.27]As the channel grows, and this is... I know this is a road that I have to figure out what I want to do about it.
[430:04.67]And I have... I don't think we've really talked about it, but... When there are... There's really two ways you can really moderate a community.
[430:14.93]I don't know, a chat room?
[430:16.47]It's like, you either just let it fly and fucking it's whatever.
[430:20.31]And just anything.
[430:21.13]It's just people just writing anything.
[430:22.77]Besides, obviously, the heinous shit that you don't want in your chat room.
[430:26.66]Or, you have to really, really moderate and have very strict rules and potentially even have it on permanent, like, sub-only mode.
[430:35.81]It's really difficult to balance in the middle.
[430:44.30]I really don't know which one of them I would rather have.
[430:48.59]Because it's tough.
[430:50.90]Because on one hand, I want there to be people just engaging and having fun and, you know, just talking shit and having a good time and being able to write whatever they want as long as it's, you know, relevant to what the fuck we're doing and if, like, in the community or whatever.
[431:05.21]But then, you know, you get to the point where is it just, like, people writing just spam that has nothing to do with anything.
[431:12.33]It's just, I'm just gonna write this because I decided to.
[431:14.13]And it's which one of those roads do you want to take?
[431:19.64]And as this channel gets to a point where there's sometimes, you know, five plus thousand, six thousand plus people at the same time, I gotta figure out how I wanna do.
[431:30.83]I wanna have a more strictly moderated chat that's, you know, very, very strict, and people, we can actually read the chat and communicate, or do I want, like, a let's get a fuck, who fucking cares?
[431:42.72]It's hard to do something in the middle.
[431:55.38]30 minute slow mode, 12 month follower only mode.
[431:58.39]That would be so bad.
[431:59.39]I don't think it's even about more mods.
[432:05.27]It's just how I want the community and the chat to be enforced.
[432:17.10]But you get to that end of the road where there's the cliff there and there's two ways to jump.
[432:26.57]increase the moderation and maybe have sub only on sometimes because this is like a shitload of potential this shitload of people here or uh just whatever it just take out like the bad stuff but just kind of let it ride and have people say kind of whatever they want it's it's tricky
[432:52.35]I don't mind chaos.
[432:53.11]I mind people posting in bad faith just to cause trouble.
[432:56.87]But that's what I'm saying.
[433:00.57]With a highly moderated chat, it's hard for that to happen.
[433:09.04]Moderate the off-topic stuff.
[433:11.75]And I can be sort of guilty of this myself, because I like to just say shit that people, you know, you guys will look over and be like, oh, hey, something about this, what about that?
[433:21.83]And then I know people are gonna fucking just start spamming and... You know what I'm saying?
[433:28.91]That's fun.
[433:29.37]So how do you manage that, too?
[433:35.19]It's a lot.
[433:38.55]I'm thinking about it.
[433:40.07]I'm thinking about it.
[433:50.39]And I know I don't, this is not, I don't like having these conversations because, but you kind of have to have them, because it's... I'm not just gonna pretend.
[434:01.03]Like, oh, yeah, uh, there's people are fucking, like, screaming in the chat, and there's the same copypasta a thousand times, and the same link has been posted a hundred times, and there's, uh, I saw one guy say something about the cow, and it is kind of there...
[434:24.23]Feeder-only mode.
[434:29.11]I actually brought... Well, it's not that I haven't brought it up.
[434:31.16]We talked about this last week.
[434:33.88]About I'm going to put a separate place for links, for images, and... I like having a fun chat.
[434:43.16]And don't get me wrong, I fucking love the chaos.
[434:47.18]But we might have to do some controlled chaos.
[434:51.95]Chaos controlled.
[434:54.90]As Shadow the Hedgehog once said.
[435:01.88]And he was onto something.
[435:13.13]And this is... I'm not, like, mad.
[435:15.51]I'm not upset about anything.
[435:18.67]It's just something we need to talk about.
[435:20.91]We gotta talk about it.
[435:24.11]I'm not mad.
[435:26.13]Obviously, if I was, you would probably know.
[435:34.29]It's just, as we go forward, we've got to think about some ways to control the chaos, but also let the chaos through.
[435:40.94]Let's see.
[435:46.08]He's disappointed.
[435:46.76]No, no, no, no, not at all.
[435:49.28]I'm not disappointed.
[435:50.23]I'm not angry.
[435:55.37]Now if you excuse me, I have to mute my mic for a minute.
[435:58.95]I swear to fu- Go fucking- every single fucking time.
[436:10.27]I'm not- I- there's nothing wrong.
[436:11.37]Alright, we'll move on.
[436:13.67]That's all I want to say.
[436:17.27]Hey, 7 layer Wario, thanks for the 1400 bits.
[436:23.65]Thanks, Wario.
[436:24.43]$14.
[436:25.45]Jerem, I got back from a really good job interview.
[436:29.25]Now I'm back home to watch you torture a village with a giant cow.
[436:32.53]Come on, that sounds like a pretty great Saturday afternoon.
[436:36.05]What's today?
[436:37.83]Thursday.
[436:38.89]That sounds like a great Thursday afternoon.
[436:47.50]Thank you.
[436:48.22]And good luck on the job.
[436:50.86]Hope you get it.
[436:53.47]Silent Serenity, thanks for 250.
[436:54.65]Hey, Jeremiah, I made a big money at the Boomer Casino stock market recently, so here's 250 bits.
[437:00.29]Don't spend it all in one place, kiddo.
[437:03.43]I won't.
[437:05.93]I will use it with something else.
[437:11.71]Thank you.
[437:14.09]Is it like two weeks?
[437:15.77]Hold on.
[437:26.77]Got the third one.
[437:29.57]Freddie Dredd and Phylactery Lich both gave... Freddie gave 100 community subs, and Phylactery gave 69.
[437:35.79]So together, they had 169 subs in 30 seconds.
[437:38.99]So thanks, both of you guys.
[437:39.99]It's fucking ridiculous.
[437:42.46]Actually fucking crazy.
[437:45.12]And Phylactery, as I'm saying this, gave 5,000 bits right now.
[437:54.00]And they say, hey Germans, you set up a 24-hour slow-mo and everyone gets one message per stream.
[437:59.84]Actually, 30 minutes I think is the longest you can do.
[438:04.22]Well, I don't want to do that, though.
[438:05.45]Like, I don't want to do that.
[438:06.61]I don't want to, like... You can only write one message every fucking 15 minutes, every 5, 10 minutes.
[438:12.07]It's just like... I don't want to do that.
[438:16.69]I like when people have fun.
[438:23.41]If you're sitting in the chat and you can only write like once every 10 minutes, no, that's not- you're not chatting.
[438:28.67]You're posting a- you're post- pe- there are people that tweet more than once every 10 minutes.
[438:35.66]And that's how long- that's what I'm allowing you to fucking chat in my stream?
[438:53.07]Wait, not the- Oh, I get it.
[439:01.83]Yeah, it was, but I don't really want, like... When you control it too much, people just start to... It's not a chat anymore, and it's not a community.
[439:11.89]It's like... I-I... No, no, no, no, no, you don't speak.
[439:15.72]You get one message.
[439:17.92]And the king's going to read that one message, and what does it say?
[439:22.32]Ah, see you in another 12 minutes when you're allowed to speak.
[439:32.45]I'll get it right.
[439:33.19]We'll figure it out.
[439:37.39]Randomized two-minute ban.
[439:40.79]What happens if you get to 10k viewers?
[439:42.81]I don't know, man.
[439:44.88]I don't know.
[439:50.51]You know, it's a constant re-evaluation of the channel.
[439:56.34]We'd have to have more... It would have to be... I don't know.
[440:01.21]I cross that bridge if that bridge ever needs to be crossed.
[440:05.19]Ah, I had technical problems with the game last week Sorry
[440:37.65]That fan patch, I wanted to make sure I get it installed.
[440:40.01]I screwed something up.
[440:47.30]Sorry.
[440:48.50]I didn't get to watch Black and White 2.
[440:51.04]But it's okay, because Murius will be back tomorrow.
[440:59.05]Oh, sorry.
[441:02.59]That should be happening.
[441:03.57]Actually, this should be happening.
[441:09.75]Ancient Sasquatch, thanks for the $2.50.
[441:11.65]I had an evil Jerma dream last night.
[441:14.71]You hacked into my phone and forced me to play your Twitch game show.
[441:18.17]You destroy other people's phones if they don't answer a few random questions right.
[441:22.06]I got about 3 out of 7, but then it came down to a troll choice between the right one and pick the green one.
[441:29.00]I answered wrong, and you destroyed it, saying, I just don't understand why there's so much nihilism in the chat.
[441:35.88]Chat spammed the Jerma nihilism emote, and that's when I woke up.
[441:43.14]Jerma nihilism.
[441:51.92]Invaders.
[441:53.01]Thanks, Invaders, for the 250.
[441:53.93]Hey, Jerma, I want to say thanks.
[441:55.47]You're the reason that I know my best friend and my partner.
[441:58.65]Henry, I love you, Henry.
[442:00.49]Thank you for bringing us together.
[442:03.27]Because without you, I would have never met him.
[442:05.47]Thank you from both of us.
[442:06.29]Well, thank you.
[442:07.83]That's good to know.
[442:10.28]That's really good to know.
[442:14.79]Thank you, invaders.
[442:17.87]Glad to bring you together.
[442:19.77]Thank you.
[442:22.15]Ah, Timothy laughing my ass off.
[442:24.05]That's a pretty great name.
[442:25.94]Ten bucks from Timothy.
[442:29.24]He just added an underscore LMAO.
[442:31.54]That's a great name.
[442:33.06]I feel like I would have that name.
[442:34.80]I want that name.
[442:35.58]I feel like that would be my name if I wasn't Jerma985.
[442:44.56]And I would just say, I would just write a bunch of bullshit in people's chats.
[442:47.08]And like, I get it.
[442:48.10]I get it.
[442:48.94]Trust me.
[442:49.79]When I tell you, I get it.
[442:51.77]I really do.
[442:53.75]I do.
[442:55.15]I mean that.
[443:00.47]Right?
[443:00.85]I know.
[443:01.27]I get it.
[443:02.22]I do.
[443:02.64]But when there's a lot of people here, I get it.
[443:07.62]Thanks for the 10 bucks, Timothy.
[443:13.47]Abomination 0, thanks to 340.
[443:15.60]$3.40.
[443:15.62]This is all I got, but I want to thank you again, Jerma.
[443:21.68]I'm going to overshare, but my shitty parents are kicking me out in a month.
[443:26.06]Just want to thank you for all the good times and help you've given me.
[443:30.00]Just by being you, keep it up.
[443:33.18]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[443:34.70]Hopefully you can crash with a friend for a while.
[443:40.00]Maybe some relatives or something might be able to help you out.
[443:43.58]That's not fun.
[443:44.32]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[443:52.06]I have no idea how old you are or what your situation is, but I really hope it gets better.
[444:02.84]I'm sure you have already, but some potential relatives, like cousins, aunts, maybe could help you.
[444:09.25]Uncles.
[444:11.32]Friends, hopefully you can get on the right path here.
[444:19.03]Thanks for the 340.
[444:19.45]Take care of yourself.
[444:26.37]Wish you the best.
[444:29.34]Hank Cheesecake, thanks for the 400 bits.
[444:33.60]Honestly, the Moo Crew has literally no power when compared to the Dru Crew.
[444:37.28]Please bring back the Dru Crew.
[444:38.70]I must return to my comrades.
[444:43.32]I don't know about that.
[444:44.28]I think I'm a Moo Crew guy.
[444:47.74]If I had to pick.
[444:49.87]The cow... I just love... The cow is like... Alright, hold on.
[444:52.75]Let's go over the evidence here.
[444:55.13]Nancy Drew.
[444:56.75]Brilliant detective.

[445:38.68]Ugh, this is tough.
[445:43.52]I'm gonna have to go Blue Crew.
[445:49.36]It's hard to pick.
[445:49.96]It really is.
[445:50.38]Alright, let's get the credits to roll here.
[446:07.13]That doesn't mean the Drew Crew is never gonna show up again.
[446:12.21]I still own a bunch of those games.
[446:14.81]It's not like it's not going to happen anymore.
[446:18.13]He does get us.
[446:19.97]People don't think I do.
[446:22.96]We're way more similar than you think.
[446:26.34]I mean that.
[446:26.76]Here comes all the subs.
[446:33.48]Shitload of community subs tonight.
[446:35.18]As well as just people subbing in general.
[446:37.37]Thank you guys.
[446:41.52]We still have some bits to do.
[446:45.82]About six or so.
[446:47.20]Let's see.
[446:48.22]Just about.
[446:48.60]I also want to touch upon the fact that after Hank Cheesecakes, $4 here, people were just giving 25 cents and saying, free us.
[447:01.33]Free us.
[447:01.91]Free us.
[447:03.40]This person says poop.
[447:04.28]This person says egg.
[447:05.48]This person says free us.
[447:09.45]I had to, like, quell it.
[447:11.21]I had to.
[447:15.80]Chaos.
[447:19.24]Lizard Amiibo, thanks for the 300 bits, Lizard Amiibo.
[447:21.48]I actually had a dream a couple months ago that I was back in high school and you were one of my teachers.
[447:28.05]You taught a class about streaming or something, but you refused to talk to any of us.
[447:31.43]You kind of just sat there and none of us said anything the whole time.
[447:34.94]You kept tripping people as they left the room at the end of the period.
[447:39.26]Worst class I've ever been and I hope you were fired.
[447:43.24]It was great to see Murius again.
[447:44.62]I missed him and his antics.
[447:48.26]tripping kids as they're leaving class what is wrong with me in your dreams I'm such a psycho peaceful hailey thanks to the 250 hey when I was streaming the other day uh some reason ai dungeon wanted to call you jerkma and generated this I heard you like listening to farting and screaming
[448:12.29]You look down at Jerkma, who has been silent for a while.
[448:14.57]He suddenly gasps as you suddenly begin farting into his ear.
[448:18.11]It smells terrible, but it tastes worse.
[448:20.30]Hey, stop doing that, he says with disgust.
[448:22.10]It stinks.
[448:22.86]Holy shit, that's insane.
[448:25.92]You didn't feed it that info?
[448:28.14]Ugh.
[448:32.47]I should be way more disgusted than I am.
[448:35.52]That's fucked up.
[448:37.20]That's messed up.
[448:38.28]I'm gonna- New Year's resolution, I'm gonna stop saying the F word.
[448:40.86]As much as I do.
[448:41.98]That's hard for me.
[448:44.08]Uh, but thank you, Hayley.
[448:44.94]That's insane.
[448:47.84]Boikey, thanks for the five dollars.
[448:49.29]Hey, Jerm, I've been doing some backlogging through the VOD and found myself screaming at you through the screen.
[448:54.81]Especially during Nancy Drew.
[448:56.41]That being said, uh, fuck the Moo Crew.
[448:58.83]When's the next Drew Crew stream so I can yell at you in chat?
[449:04.96]uh I'm captain of the moo crew and I don't appreciate that at all Nancy Drew doesn't eat rocks so what Nancy Drew let me okay I'm gonna say this one more time Nancy Drew does not eat rocks and throw up and kick houses the choice is obvious
[449:38.56]Soon, though.
[449:39.80]Whenever this, whenever I have no... No, it's not.
[449:41.93]It's not gonna be soon.
[449:43.77]There's a plan for every single day that I turn the stream on.
[449:47.61]We're going to GameCube soon.
[449:49.47]I got Chibi-Robo, Gachi Force, Mario Sunshine.
[449:55.70]We gotta do, there's like a bunch, I have Wii games, No More Heroes 2, Mega Man Legends 2.
[450:03.30]I got the Riddick games.
[450:09.44]Cooking Mama, all of them.
[450:11.62]All the raving... All the Rabbids games.
[450:14.51]Guys, this is never going to end.
[450:26.26]Yeah.
[450:32.10]Gacha Force is one of my most looked forward to games to stream since I started streaming.
[450:37.52]That's a bold statement, I know.
[450:38.94]Holy fuck, what did he just say?
[450:41.08]Yeah.
[450:43.14]Gacha Force, you guys don't know what this is.
[450:45.58]This is going to be the most pog stream in the last probably two years.
[450:54.11]It's, yep, it's one of those games.
[451:01.60]I doubt that.
[451:02.16]Yeah, me too.
[451:02.86]But I can hype up a stream, can't I?
[451:08.26]What about the carnival stream?
[451:09.26]No, no.
[451:10.10]Video.
[451:10.47]Like, purely video game stream.
[451:12.09]Purely video gaming.
[451:13.21]Like, I stream a video game.
[451:18.77]Yeah.
[451:20.78]Just wait until you see you collect these little robots and you make a team of robots and you fight other robot teams and they come out of boxes.
[451:27.65]You guys are going to love it.
[451:28.55]There's boxes you open.
[451:29.83]You don't have to pay any money.
[451:31.11]You guys are going to love it.
[451:39.19]Hey, Esquilo.
[451:40.09]Thanks for the E250.
[451:41.21]Hey, Jerkma.
[451:42.09]Why is everybody calling me Jerkma?
[451:43.55]Sometimes I make edits of your face and I'd like to send your Jermom edit.
[451:46.70]Let's see what it is.
[451:55.33]This is very scary.
[451:58.12]Let's put it on screen to scare everybody else.
[452:24.58]It's pretty scary.
[452:29.57]Also, uh, I lost, there it is.
[452:31.89]Oh, big thanks for being such a good person and reminding me of my brother.
[452:35.85]You have this aura.
[452:37.71]And for supporting the LGBTQ plus community.
[452:41.17]Please visit subs Discord chat once in a while.
[452:43.51]Shout out to Haley streaming subs.
[452:49.98]Yeah, I've made that clear before that I have my full support.
[453:02.87]I'm open to everybody.
[453:05.75]I don't give a shit who the fuck you are.
[453:08.24]I don't care at all.
[453:10.64]I care about people hanging out here and getting along and having a good fucking time.
[453:18.40]That's it.
[453:19.16]I don't give a shit about anything else.
[453:24.89]I really did.
[453:26.47]That is my priority.
[453:28.69]Whoever you are, whatever walk of life, whoever you are,
[453:32.87]We can just hang out and fucking watch a cow throw rocks at people.
[453:36.50]That's it.
[453:40.74]You don't have a barrier here.
[453:58.87]What barrier would I make?
[454:01.59]I don't want to tell somebody what.
[454:04.75]Why would I have a barrier?
[454:05.97]Would I want certain people to not watch my Twitch channel?
[454:08.37]It doesn't make any sense.
[454:12.11]I want anybody to enjoy this channel.
[454:23.68]No, that's not what I said.
[454:24.76]Oh, did I say it wrong?
[454:27.82]What if we don't have internet?
[454:30.20]Just... No, I'm not gonna... That would've been weird if I just said that.
[454:36.43]But, no.
[454:40.26]We just have to be careful, guys.
[454:43.10]Because...
[454:45.59]And let's address it now.
[454:47.79]I've seen some of the fighting that happens in the chat.
[454:51.25]I've seen some of the shit, you know, somebody will do like a trans pride emote, for instance.
[454:56.50]And all of a sudden it's like, okay, now let's have a gigantic fight in the chat.
[455:00.92]And let's just derail everything.
[455:03.52]We're not even talking about the game or the community anymore.
[455:06.62]And people are just fucking screaming at each other.
[455:11.06]That is...
[455:14.91]This stream is for us to have fun and hang out and have a good time.
[455:27.69]People who do that don't care about trans pride.
[455:31.45]No, I'm well aware, I'm well aware of all
[455:36.10]Look, there are people that see a trans pride emote and they just fucking say something horrible.
[455:44.00]And then that gets a reaction of people that are just like, it's an emote and then that starts a fight and then that starts a fight and it's like, fuck you, fuck you.
[455:51.07]It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[455:53.85]This is not what we're doing here.
[455:58.09]This is not what we're doing here.
[456:00.77]We're not gonna have fights about
[456:05.23]People's identities and people's fucking preferences and gay, straight, trans.
[456:13.40]That doesn't matter to me.
[456:14.48]It shouldn't matter to you.
[456:17.72]But again, I would, like I said previously, we gotta talk about spam.
[456:22.96]We have to talk about people just writing shit and writing whatever they want.
[456:27.89]And then going forward how I want to moderate the channel.
[456:35.74]Jerma nihilism.
[456:36.92]No more messages.
[456:39.04]Can you say this during a live stream?
[456:40.99]I'm doing it now.
[456:46.83]Can't ask for feet cam anymore.
[456:51.97]I just want everybody to fucking have a good time.
[456:56.39]I don't like looking over and seeing that it's just people fighting in this community about this shit.
[457:05.95]And it's not even... Why is it people even fighting over this?
[457:11.90]I think everybody needs to fucking kind of internalize this and maybe pump the brakes a little.
[457:26.33]You should block trans pride if it's bothering you.
[457:28.71]No, no, that's not.
[457:30.28]I'm not going to ban emotes.
[457:33.62]That's just... That's absurd to me.
[457:38.50]No, that's not...
[457:51.22]I feel like I joined at a bad time.
[457:52.72]No, we're just going over... And I've seen it.
[457:55.76]I've seen it.
[457:56.10]And I've tried to... Kind of change the conversation a little bit.
[458:02.04]Try to get away from people arguing and chat about this stuff.
[458:06.83]But I do want to make it really clear that... I would like us to fucking be able to get along.
[458:14.23]I don't want people to be downed each other's throats when I'm like, I'm like fucking throw, like I said, I'm going to use this as a perfect example because it's a great example.
[458:27.85]If I'm throwing rocks at people as Murius and like eating people on screen,
[458:36.07]If I'm like surfing on a wave, I don't want to... It sucks to look over and see people fucking hate each other.
[458:41.51]It's just not... It sucks.
[458:43.67]It's not cool.
[458:44.31]I don't like it.
[458:44.79]That's not what this community is for.
[458:48.56]That's not what this community should stand for.
[459:00.14]We're here to have fun and enjoy each other's company.
[459:03.79]False stop.
[459:04.45]End of story.
[459:16.20]No, we're here to make fun of you.
[459:20.19]And there's a difference between banter and people actually getting truly upset at each other.
[459:28.75]Us fucking around back and forth.
[459:30.41]We do it all the time.
[459:46.02]People that have a problem with the emote should be banned because they bring negativity.
[459:50.94]Well, also, I mean, there's... I've talked to some of the mods about it, and... There's potential of people writing, like, for instance, like, the Trans Pride emote a bunch of times.
[460:02.33]Specifically, maybe to try to bait somebody to be angry with them.
[460:06.61]I think we've gotten there.
[460:11.93]And...
[460:14.04]That's what happens.
[460:15.60]And then real people then start to get angry with each other.
[460:22.41]Yeah, we did discuss that, yeah.
[460:40.18]Internet doesn't change.
[460:42.68]That's why I'm just saying we have to be careful, because you don't... You don't want to start fucking screaming at somebody, and the mods are... We haven't had... We're supposed to be doing another kind of state-of-the-channel mod meeting.
[460:56.71]I'm sure some of you guys in the Discord have seen us.
[461:00.43]In the... Archmage's Tower, sometimes.
[461:04.28]You just see a bunch of names, and I'm in there, too.
[461:06.12]We go over stuff.
[461:07.06]We talk about this stuff, and...
[461:10.06]We want to find out ways to make it so it's enjoyable for everybody.
[461:21.65]It is still called the Archmage's Tower.
[461:34.69]I love how much we still talk about Sora.
[461:36.25]It's such a huge part of my entire life.
[461:43.64]But hopefully, hopefully we can start to move on from that because I've made my stance clear that I'm in full support.
[461:54.84]I think over the years you guys have heard me say it plenty of times.
[462:00.06]Don't want to see you guys fucking hating each other.
[462:02.66]Not here.
[462:03.34]Not at all.
[462:04.54]And not ever.
[462:06.80]We gotta get over this shit.
[462:13.40]Anyways, kind of tack that on to the conversation we had like 20 minutes ago.
[462:35.19]Acting like what movements were apolitical.
[462:39.75]Well, I'm not even talking about politics versus not politics versus socially.
[462:43.66]I'm just saying in general.
[462:45.58]My main problem is looking over here and seeing people actually really upset with each other.
[462:54.16]Because this is new.
[462:56.15]This is only within the last probably six months or so.
[463:00.45]I've been around for ten years.
[463:02.55]This is new.
[463:14.66]But I've never really talked about this like this.
[463:17.50]In this kind of candid way.
[463:18.54]So... That's why I'm spending a little extra time on it.
[463:35.19]Anyways.
[463:38.71]We will continue.
[463:40.73]The conversation that needed to happen.
[463:43.11]Yeah, it did.
[463:43.93]It did.
[463:44.37]And...
[463:46.55]I'm actually glad that I could bring it up.
[463:50.56]Moving on.
[463:52.64]Moving on.
[463:53.02]Goobery Juice, thanks for the 300 bits.
[464:01.00]Bro, that was a lot of fun.
[464:01.94]I just want to tell you how much I appreciate the work you put into your streams.
[464:04.81]You're constantly innovating and bringing your best effort to every stream.
[464:07.51]I just want to say that I love you as a person, Jerma.
[464:12.35]Oh, wait, this is the wrong stream.
[464:13.45]Sorry, pal.
[464:13.99]I'm sure you're okay, too, maybe.
[464:15.87]Even if you are a total himbo.
[464:17.15]Just kidding.
[464:17.57]I was talking about you.
[464:18.47]Don't read this part.
[464:21.38]He didn't say my name, but I put it in there anyways.
[464:26.46]I have the power.
[464:27.52]I read the messages.
[464:28.62]I can change it to whatever I want.
[464:30.64]I can have it say anything I want.
[464:33.38]Thank you for the $3, Goobery Juice.
[464:38.60]Gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[464:39.64]Turn on your fucking lights.
[464:40.42]You look like a Darkest Dungeon highway man.
[464:42.30]That's pretty pog, actually.
[464:43.67]Thanks.
[464:45.71]Kiki Morris Sunday, thanks for the... I said your name wrong.
[464:48.77]You said that you were never going to give money ever again if I said it wrong again.
[464:51.33]I'm sorry.
[464:57.14]You sure did.
[464:59.38]Kiki Morris Sunday.
[465:01.06]Fuck.
[465:04.63]soiled it thanks to the five dollars oh I'm doing the finger bite anyways uh read my read my imagine I've been trying to make you read this on stream for like a month it's okay you can't pronounce my username okay bye
[465:32.18]And this says, Jerma will never move to Philadelphia and just happen to be not only in the same apartment complex as mine, but right next to door.
[465:39.48]And I introduced myself by giving him cookies and he's like, the fuck are these?
[465:42.78]I don't eat sugar all the time.
[465:44.18]Like you do fatty.
[465:45.18]And he slaps the plate out of my hands.
[465:51.70]What was this so important?
[465:53.28]Why did I need to read that?
[465:58.36]Well, I don't know why that's so important.
[466:01.37]It just is.
[466:01.79]Alright, well, thank you for the five dollars.
[466:05.20]Kiko!
[466:07.40]Second part of your name!
[466:10.74]Thank you though, seriously.
[466:11.88]Sorry for fucking up your name every time.
[466:15.40]Bulbaswag, thanks for the five dollars.
[466:16.88]Have you thought about doing a test stream with stricter rules to see how it feels?
[466:26.39]Ugh.
[466:34.27]It's so tough for me.
[466:35.25]I just want... It's hard.
[466:38.01]Yes, I have.
[466:42.69]Absolutely.
[466:43.17]Sure.
[466:47.27]Do a test stream on Master of Comedy.
[466:51.37]People are going to be worse.
[466:53.33]I think that initially something like that would be bad for a while.
[466:56.75]But then people would just get used to it.
[466:58.04]And that's just your chat.
[467:01.22]after a while but the problem is and here's the real problem I've been doing this for so long with the same kind of rules for six straight years that that's a big change because I've been doing it for so long if I just started streaming six months ago that's different but we've had the same kind of rules for a long time so
[467:34.81]Has it been six years?
[467:35.81]I started streaming on Twitch.
[467:37.75]My channel got partnered in like 2014 or 2015.
[467:41.40]I've been streaming on Twitch since like 2014 or so.
[467:43.90]2015.
[467:44.82]That's when I got partnered.
[467:53.53]We need more mods.
[467:56.59]Maybe we'll do like a fucking big mod.
[468:00.54]Maybe I was going to do a mod apocalypse before.
[468:02.66]Maybe we need to do a mod knighting ceremony.
[468:15.29]Mod lottery.
[468:20.20]Yeah.
[468:26.51]I do not take this lightly at all.
[468:28.07]And I know people are going, well, man, you stand, you've been a real long fucking time on this.
[468:31.39]It means a lot to me because I want people to enjoy this stream.
[468:35.57]I want you to be able to shitpost.
[468:36.75]I want you to be able to fucking say the things you want to say and have fun.
[468:42.41]But, you know, I got to fucking reel it in.
[468:45.27]That's just, that's it.
[468:51.17]But we have one more here.
[468:52.61]Well, no, two more actually.
[468:56.83]Avery dropped dead thanks to the 250.
[468:58.44]Jeremiah, if you could read this privately, I'd appreciate it.
[469:00.54]Okay.
[469:01.78]Will do.
[469:03.02]Thank you for the 250.
[469:11.86]Thank you.
[469:14.62]Everything is being looked at and talked about, so don't worry.
[469:18.02]Thank you.
[469:19.57]Finally, Ubermorphpoint, thanks for the $15, 1500 bits.
[469:23.27]I sincerely appreciate your will to stomp out negativity in your community.
[469:26.85]So many content creators let those parts fester and become worse.
[469:33.27]I think... I think the word, like, stomp out negativity is... I mean, not necessarily correct.
[469:45.60]Because...
[469:50.72]I don't want... Look, if you tell somebody that they're stupid and they're wrong and they're an idiot, that you make that person fucking even more angry and hateful.
[470:04.41]You know what I'm saying?
[470:19.11]It's hard.
[470:21.20]Trying to, you know, push people in a more positive direction, but without telling them that like, wow, you are sure are a fucking idiot.
[470:32.62]Like, oh yeah, I'm a fucking idiot.
[470:34.88]Huh?
[470:36.28]You're a fucking idiot.
[470:38.90]It's tricky.
[470:49.89]Nice political debate.
[470:53.47]Some people are just... Some... Some people... And some people are just playing out to cause chaos.
[470:58.58]Yeah, I know.
[470:59.64]That's why it's so tricky.
[471:01.88]Because like...
[471:04.39]Stomping out negativity is like what if the negativity is coming from a place of somebody just trying to make a Problem because they haven't but that's what they're doing for fun Then you have like two potential negativity sources that are coming at each other.
[471:19.82]It's just Just riling shit up yeah Haha who would do that?
[471:38.12]You can't act like both sides are equally at fault.
[471:40.12]No, absolutely not.
[471:54.66]Like, if you're like a bigot, or like a racist and shit, like, yeah, you shouldn't fucking be like that.
[472:02.35]Like, don't be like that.
[472:03.83]That's not good.
[472:05.35]That's really not fucking good.
[472:16.52]But it's sometimes not that easy to simply just say those things.
[472:25.83]Because the person listening might not give a shit about anything you're saying.
[472:32.15]It's actually really tricky.
[472:38.02]You ended racism.
[472:49.96]The CEO of racism.
[472:52.10]Oh my god.
[472:54.13]I was here.
[472:55.39]Alright, alright.
[473:08.41]You did it!
[473:09.01]Alright, we did it!
[473:09.95]God.
[473:21.57]But this stuff is hard to talk about.
[473:23.35]Because when I turn my streams on, I don't turn my stream on with the idea of... You know what?
[473:30.62]I'm going to talk about a bunch of issues today.
[473:33.18]Let me talk about all the bad shit in the world.
[473:37.70]That's not what I'm doing here.
[473:43.74]That's not the point of this stream.
[473:46.88]It never has and it never will be.
[473:56.30]Sometimes we can, you know, somewhere... When I feel comfortable doing it, you know, we talk about it like we're doing right now.
[474:10.81]Stop to talk about it.
[474:18.10]I've lost so many wink points trying to get him to read.
[474:20.32]Wait, what?
[474:29.95]Uh, please say it again when there isn't, when it's not the end of the stream.
[474:32.63]Most people who need to hear this message already left.
[474:38.22]He's bullying me.
[474:39.98]What?
[474:40.24]I didn't, what?
[474:41.10]I just read it.
[474:52.33]It really bothers me that no matter how long this ending sequence is, popcorn's never cleaned.
[474:55.87]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[474:59.43]I just want to watch funny man play video game and not have to deal with spam.
[475:04.63]We're working on it.
[475:07.32]It's hard to do.
[475:13.63]Don't think I don't think about this all the time.
[475:15.29]I do.
[475:23.15]And I'm going to be completely upfront and honest about this.
[475:27.13]This is not something that has been really in the back of my mind.
[475:33.31]This is not like a, we gotta fucking talk chat.
[475:36.71]It's just recently there's been some fighting.
[475:40.03]And I'd like to see it stop.
[475:45.54]I turn on my stream and I just, let's go have some fun.
[475:58.20]Make more t-shirts.
[475:59.15]You got it.
