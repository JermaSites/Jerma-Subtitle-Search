[02:25.97]It could be George.
[02:27.05]It could be George.
[02:28.46]Sounds like George.
[02:29.74]What's going on?
[02:30.34]What's up, Jermall?
[02:30.76]Sounds like George.

[02:34.23]What's happening over there?
[02:35.19]What's going on?
[02:36.01]What are you doing?
[02:36.57]What are you doing, George?
[02:37.67]I'm playing demo.
[02:39.73]This is my favorite class besides engineer.
[02:42.66]Oh, yeah?
[02:44.06]Yeah, I got a medic on me.
[02:45.80]I'm doing pretty well.

[02:49.15]We've been seeing a whole lot of Gold Rush this weekend.
[02:51.63]I'm a huge Gold Rush fan.
[02:53.12]It's like my favorite map.
[02:54.36]Yeah.
[02:54.94]Oh, yeah?
[02:56.32]It's behind Upward.
[02:57.50]Everybody loves Upward, though.
[02:58.63]Come on.
[03:00.35]No, you're right.
[03:00.95]Oh, give me the crit.
[03:01.69]Got the crit.
[03:03.46]Oh, you don't want to be up in that room.
[03:06.39]You don't want to... Well, get that sticky?
[03:07.87]Sticky.
[03:11.90]This is some impressive gameplay.
[03:13.16]I know, Jerm.
[03:13.72]I didn't know you got this good at this game.
[03:17.22]Oh, I was... Look at that.

[03:19.45]So heavy.
[03:20.93]Oh, this is the best I've ever played in my life.
[03:26.40]Well, good thing it's live.
[03:29.72]I've never done this well.
[03:30.86]Hopefully people are recording.
[03:36.75]Oh, you got that guy.
[03:38.92]You think you're going to be safe with a crit?
[03:41.02]Didn't think so.
[03:43.48]One more, one more, one more.
[03:46.09]No, watch, turn around, watch it, watch it, watch it.
[03:51.05]So Jerma, you are a regular to the event.

[04:14.72]Excuse me!
[04:15.40]Excuse me!
[04:17.58]That was quite the pipe sequence we just saw there.
[04:22.06]Incredible.
[04:22.49]Excuse me, look at the top.
[04:25.19]Look at the top.
[04:25.71]George.
[04:26.29]Who's on the top?
[04:27.93]It's George.
[04:28.94]That's you.
[04:30.00]George985.
[04:32.26]George985.
[04:34.65]He's premiering his new alt account, George985.
[04:37.49]Yeah, it's coming out soon.
[04:40.76]Actually, you know, can I be right back for like two minutes?
[04:46.01]Yeah.
[04:47.73]I didn't get like a snack before I came.
[04:49.62]Okay.
[04:50.02]Alright.
[04:50.72]I'll be right back.
[04:51.60]Sure.
[04:52.22]What are you doing over there, Sideshow?
[04:54.76]Trying to play, but getting smacked by Jerma constantly wherever I go for some reason.
[05:00.31]I'm pretty sure you smacked me.
[05:02.19]I did, yeah.
[05:02.73]You dropped.
[05:03.38]Like hard?
[05:04.70]Yeah, pretty badly.
[05:05.74]Pretty badly, really.
[05:06.38]To a roller as well.
[05:08.52]Looks like a classic TF2 setup time here.
[05:11.51]Everyone, you got conga lines, high fives, classic.
[05:16.27]Looks like some good old TF2 to me.
[05:17.89]Everybody wants to high five George.
[05:20.39]He's not even there.
[05:21.38]George is AFK.
[05:24.06]Maybe if they offered him a snack, he would get it?
[05:26.88]Maybe.
[05:27.64]That would be... Hold on.
[05:31.12]Oh!
[05:31.79]Well...
[05:36.79]Hello.
[05:37.97]Put on that headset there.
[05:40.23]Security?
[05:40.70]Perfect.
[05:41.98]Where am I?
[05:45.20]Is this George?
[05:47.95]I went to my fridge and I just came back.
[05:50.81]I don't know how I got here.
[05:51.58]We need to get security online.
[05:57.06]I have at least two apples.
[06:00.60]He ate an apple whole earlier.
[06:02.75]Let me get those set up for you.
[06:04.39]Excuse me, sir.
[06:04.91]Could you introduce yourself, please?
[06:06.46]Who, me?
[06:07.82]Yeah.
[06:08.92]Hi, I'm Jerva.
[06:10.14]Jerva985 on the YouTube.com website.
[06:13.57]Check it out sometime.
[06:15.17]No, I'm... Hi.
[06:16.82]How's it going?
[06:17.88]You're here.
[06:18.14]I feel like an airline pilot.
[06:20.66]Does anybody else feel like that?
[06:22.02]Absolutely.
[06:22.52]So how'd you get here?
[06:24.89]Boy, what just happened there?
[06:26.17]Hey, I just flew in from Boston, and boy, are my arms tired.
[06:29.03]You know what I'm saying?
[06:30.25]You ever heard that one before?
[06:33.72]No, I told you guys I was going to be here.
[06:35.70]Hey, run the tape back.
[06:37.22]Last year, what'd I say?
[06:38.57]I'm going to be here next year, and I'm here.
[06:40.73]I told you I was going to be here.
[06:42.43]I told you.
[06:43.98]I told you.
[06:44.69]I didn't tell you.
[06:45.43]You might have told me.
[06:46.08]I might have told him.
[06:46.86]Maybe.
[06:47.27]Potentially.
[06:49.23]Hi.
[06:50.03]Hello.
[06:50.54]Hello, everybody.
[06:51.28]It's great to be here.

[07:19.81]But Jeremiah, yeah, wow.
[07:21.25]That was quite the snack run you went on.
[07:23.84]Just went for a snack run.
[07:25.12]Walked into a time war.
[07:26.70]By the way, you're wearing like a Star Wars shirt right now.
[07:29.67]I didn't realize that.
[07:30.47]Like, where's my tip of the hat shirt off?
[07:32.37]Star Wars.
[07:33.57]Have you ever seen that movie?
[07:34.65]Have you seen that movie?
[07:35.66]good movie it's you know the new one's coming out isn't it yeah looking forward to it yes December the hidden sponsor of the show yeah hidden sponsor coming out December 2016 starring Jerma yeah I'm gonna be in it
[07:51.28]Remember I told you, hey, that was a subtle hint.
[07:53.37]Airline pilot.
[07:54.27]Oh, he's going to be maybe flying a TIE fighter in the next movie.
[08:01.24]I see George is still playing.
[08:02.60]How's that working out?
[08:03.82]Hey, George is doing real well over here.
[08:05.85]Surprising.
[08:06.61]Yeah.
[08:07.83]Someone's at your house right now.
[08:10.53]I think it's Otto.
[08:13.50]Your dog is playing for you right now.
[08:15.10]He's got my hat on, too.
[08:16.54]What am I doing?
[08:19.11]without a hat so I can actually, you know, breathe for once.
[08:23.20]Yeah, absolutely.
[08:24.72]That's like a Boston Park League hat.
[08:28.49]Are we watching George do some moves here?
[08:31.17]Yeah, he's doing pretty good.
[08:33.13]That's Otto.
[08:34.47]That's Otto on the PC.
[08:37.26]Do I sound alright?
[08:38.02]Is this too close?
[08:38.94]No, you sound great.
[08:40.62]You sound like Jerma.
[08:41.88]Do I?
[08:43.16]Slightly.
[08:43.58]That George guy is real similar to Jerma, I found.
[08:47.53]He's very similar.
[08:48.85]Peculiar, yeah.
[08:50.13]You two are very tall boys, by the way.
[08:51.77]I feel like I need to sit up straight.
[08:53.54]There we go.
[08:54.10]Tell me about it.
[08:54.82]How's my hair?
[08:55.48]Anybody have any gel?
[08:57.74]Anybody product I can put in?
[08:59.18]We both have product in our hotel.
[09:03.36]It's called emulsification, if you didn't know.
[09:06.55]No, that's called the... Doesn't even need a word.
[09:10.10]That's what it's called?
[09:10.62]Doesn't even need a word.
[09:14.36]Mala's here.
[09:18.44]We're on the camera for Mala.
[09:20.09]No pressure.
[09:20.67]Hello.
[09:21.17]No pressure.
[09:21.83]Just show us something incredible.
[09:24.17]I mean, we saw what George was doing earlier.
[09:25.97]That one sequence of pipes he pulled off there.
[09:29.84]You telling me.
[09:31.00]I was the one that trained George.
[09:33.02]Yeah.
[09:33.82]Twitched through a pog in the chat and everyone went wild.
[09:38.43]Well, see, what you don't know is I telepathically, it's very difficult for me to do this.
[09:43.50]I have to concentrate 200% of my energetical fluids, and I can actually play.
[09:49.99]Right now I have a robotic system set up in my house, and right now I have a telekinesis of playing the game.
[09:54.90]It's extremely straining me right now, so I'm sorry if I'm having a little bit of trouble on the couch here.
[09:59.76]No, it's fine.
[10:00.60]I'm doing two things at the same time.
[10:01.79]It's interesting you bring that up because we had a weird joke about that yesterday about
[10:05.91]Danford wanting to be a dolphin to use more of his brain power 20% exactly well wow you got past that that's something I've made it's been it's been a talent I've acquired over the years well none of that's true but $30 says just bought a sweet tip of the hat shirt and now it's time to donate keep up the good work guys thank you so much birdie and of course everyone at home you can also donate and participate by getting in on the teespring campaign believe it's $25 and
[10:35.90]And they're beautiful, beautiful t-shirts.
[10:37.66]You can see one on the table here and also behind us.
[10:40.40]So thanks again, BirdieTFT.
[10:42.99]Does anyone want to, like, throw me a, like, shirt?
[10:45.31]I feel so, like, hey.
[10:46.93]You do have a shirt.
[10:47.73]I know.
[10:48.31]You guys gave it to me, and I was just like, yeah, I'll put it on.
[10:50.57]I, like, forgot.
[10:52.28]What a dummy.
[10:53.14]It's okay.
[10:53.64]You just got here.
[10:55.00]I did just walk here, and I brought my apples.
[10:57.92]There's three of them, guys.
[10:59.41]I can't do that on stream.
[11:01.35]There's no way.
[11:02.01]I just want to hold it.
[11:03.61]You can't eat an apple on stream.
[11:05.97]You can't eat an apple on a stream?
[11:07.40]No, no, no.
[11:08.06]Admirable ate the entire thing.
[11:09.22]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[11:10.26]If you saw Admirable earlier, he ate the whole thing in like two bites.
[11:13.49]Three bites.
[11:14.51]I was worried.
[11:15.53]That last bite?
[11:17.47]Yeah, first live death on the stream.
[11:20.20]I was standing by.
[11:21.14]Don't worry.
[11:21.44]He just avoided it by a hair.
[11:22.38]Wait, what is he, like allergic to apples?
[11:24.48]He ate about half of an apple in one bite.
[11:27.87]Took him like 20 minutes to chew the whole thing down.
[11:30.36]Remarkable.
[11:31.90]That hurts.
[11:32.92]There's a core in here.
[11:33.94]Oh, he put that in his mouth, chewed it, and swallowed it.
[11:36.83]He ate the core.
[11:39.04]He ate the core.
[11:39.68]Play the VOD.
[11:40.90]We need to play the VOD back.
[11:41.90]There's a vine of it.
[11:43.96]He ate the stem as well, I think.
[11:45.50]Did he eat the stem?
[11:46.48]He did.
[11:47.32]Maniac.
[11:48.72]I would never do such a thing.
[11:51.07]There's two people that want to stay on Gold Rush.
[11:56.33]I like Gold Rush.
[11:57.30]People don't like Gold Rush.
[11:58.16]Why not?
[11:58.36]Maybe it's because they're switching to Badwater.
[12:00.64]Classic.
[12:01.66]A staple of the game.
[12:03.48]Badwater.
[12:04.59]Don't drop the apple.
[12:05.47]I know.
[12:05.71]I got to make sure it's safe.
[12:07.13]We all have to be holding them.
[12:08.35]Put it behind here.
[12:09.71]Make sure it's safe.
[12:11.97]Nice camera.
[12:13.23]I like that shot of George.
[12:15.07]Nice close-up of his face.
[12:16.65]I like it.
[12:17.47]He's got the GoPro strapped to his head.
[12:22.90]I can't wait to play this game here and, like, actually you get to see the real George play the game.
[12:28.27]Absolutely.
[12:28.85]And then the camera never shows him because he's awful and he never does anything cool.
[12:32.99]Speaking of GoPros and the man who wears them, that being Sideshow, he also likes to wear a box.
[12:38.12]How's that donation incentive going?
[12:39.94]Well, if you want to see Sideshow play in a box with the GoPro, we are at $9,268 on that challenge goal.
[12:48.29]So please, guys, when you donate, you can go over to the right side of the donate box and fill out that you want your funds to go to either that stretch goal or the many others that we have going.
[12:56.69]But I think everyone here, including myself, we want to see Sideshow within a box.
[13:00.12]That's a good one.
[13:00.84]That's a classic.
[13:02.34]custom made the box this morning as well yeah he actually made it himself if you could tell us specifically for sideshow it looks great I'm currently in a box in the game as well I'm uh being completely undetected can we get a shot of that I'm just gonna see if I can last the entire map well there you go challenging challenge Matt where is that
[13:26.42]I'm not going to give it away.
[13:30.85]There we go.
[13:31.92]Pretty sure I'm not going to die.
[13:33.18]I'm not even kidding.
[13:34.24]I didn't even see it.
[13:36.05]I thought that was a regular box.
[13:37.31]I didn't see it either.
[13:38.41]Oh, no.
[13:40.66]No.
[13:41.06]No.
[13:41.57]What is this?
[13:44.28]That's like a bad Transformers costume.
[13:47.90]All you got to do is spray paint the Necronomicon, what's on the side of this thing?
[13:54.90]What are they called?
[13:55.48]The bots.
[13:56.66]The bots.
[13:57.52]The Autobots.
[13:59.02]No, no, the bad ones.
[13:59.80]The bad bots.
[14:00.50]Decepticons.
[14:01.03]The Decepticons.
[14:01.87]That's right.
[14:02.79]The Decepticons.
[14:04.13]Yeah.
[14:04.71]Paint it on the box and Sideshow is just going to go rogue and start doing crime throughout the city.
[14:10.36]We'll record it with a GoPro.
[14:13.54]I don't think I'd get away with it.
[14:16.97]There aren't many people running around committing crimes in a box with a GoPro on their head.
[14:21.07]Oh, look at that.
[14:21.45]See that jump?
[14:21.93]That was a pretty sick jump.
[14:23.42]Don't you think?
[14:24.10]Yeah.
[14:24.42]That was a pretty sick jump.
[14:26.90]Wow, look at this guy hiding in the corner.
[14:28.97]Where's that balloonicorn?
[14:30.05]Over there?
[14:30.61]Yeah, right there.
[14:31.01]Right there.
[14:31.39]Do you want to need it?
[14:33.18]I just kind of want to hold it.
[14:34.98]I kind of want to hold it.
[14:35.90]Perfect.
[14:37.57]Be careful with that.
[14:39.52]If you want to keep blowing it up, it's not fully blown up.
[14:42.61]My small lungs only have so much air.
[14:45.39]Where is the thing to blow it up?
[14:47.99]I hate putting this up to my mouth with a strange place.
[14:53.74]That's like on the side.
[14:55.30]Is it on the horn?
[14:56.49]There's another one on the horn.
[14:58.05]Get this thing fully blown up.
[14:59.91]I think that only blows up the horn, though.
[15:02.23]My great-grandfather had the lung capacity of an angelfish.
[15:07.40]I'll tell you right now, he's gonna show up here
[15:11.91]If I can open the thing.
[15:13.01]That's just the horn.
[15:14.19]That will only blow up the horn.
[15:15.91]What?
[15:16.29]Yes.
[15:16.97]Really?
[15:17.15]You need to get the body.
[15:17.77]There you go.
[15:18.15]Alright.
[15:18.41]Here we go.
[15:18.91]That one's already popped out for you.
[15:20.93]Alright.
[15:21.29]If I pass out.
[15:22.24]Boston out.
[15:23.20]Whatever.
[15:23.80]We have a nurse on site.
[15:24.90]There's a nurse on site.
[15:25.72]There's a nurse right there.
[15:26.86]She's in TF2, though.
[15:27.46]I am on site.
[15:28.46]Alright.
[15:28.72]Here we go.
[15:29.32]I will save you.
[15:30.16]There we go.
[15:30.88]Can you just open?
[15:31.74]Can you please open?
[15:33.27]There we go.
[15:34.03]Okay.
[15:34.59]Whose mouth was on this?
[15:36.51]Anybody else's mouth?
[15:37.51]Justin Danford.
[15:38.29]I think that was blood.
[15:40.27]Right over there.
[15:40.97]I did my best.
[15:41.65]You did your best?
[15:42.29]Alright, well, here we go.
[15:46.66]I think the mic needs to be a little close.
[15:48.38]We need to hear this.
[15:51.73]Well, welcome to the tip of the hats, everybody.
[15:59.05]Oh my god.
[15:59.78]Wow, you can really feel it.
[16:01.92]That's how you blow up a sheep.
[16:04.64]That's how you blow up a sheep.
[16:06.26]That's a sheep.
[16:06.82]That's how you blow up a sheep.
[16:08.98]That thing is ready to go.
[16:10.82]There it is.
[16:11.78]You weren't lying when you were talking about the lung capacity there.
[16:14.38]Passing down from generation to generation in the Jerma family.
[16:16.89]I don't feel well.
[16:20.89]That thing is cool.
[16:23.39]Absolutely.
[16:23.91]After all that, that thing is cool.
[16:26.84]Good input, Jerma.
[16:28.62]Back to George.
[16:30.62]Well, never mind.
[16:31.42]He's deceased.
[16:33.46]There he goes.
[16:35.07]Ooh, Ozzy.
[16:37.41]You guys know I'm a big Aussie fan.
[16:39.79]The biggest Aussie fan.
[16:41.10]No pressure.
[16:41.72]Aussie's quite the gamer.
[16:43.36]Kind of handed it to me in the MG tournament yesterday.
[16:46.46]You're playing Final Fantasy.
[16:48.11]It's all playing Final Fantasy XIV.
[16:51.67]Is that a new one coming out too?
[16:53.23]I don't know.
[16:53.75]Ask Aussie.
[16:54.25]Is it the one where they ride bikes?
[16:56.58]Aussie, you just killed your teammate and yourself.
[17:01.99]XV is the one where they ride motorcycles, right?
[17:03.57]I think so, yes.
[17:04.47]Isn't the new one like the VII revamp?
[17:07.50]I don't know.
[17:08.74]There's like 400 Final Fantasies.
[17:11.10]They're just going to keep going.
[17:13.03]Just like we are.
[17:14.63]Here at Tip of the Hats, we're almost at 100K.
[17:17.71]How about that?
[17:18.27]That is awesome.
[17:19.47]We're almost at that Sideshow stretch goal.
[17:22.36]Get there.
[17:24.40]Under $500, guys.
[17:25.24]So if you want to see Sideshow in a box, please.
[17:27.88]I definitely want to see it.
[17:28.90]Make my dreams come true.
[17:30.21]A man in a box.
[17:31.89]We're so close.
[17:33.57]Is that going to include the GoPro again, too?
[17:36.04]Yeah.
[17:36.48]He actually was cutting a special hole just for the GoPro.
[17:39.32]Perfect.
[17:41.36]Come on.
[17:43.99]Get one of those.
[17:45.57]Your reward for losing this round will be bad water.
[17:49.86]I love bad water.
[17:51.46]Is that where they're going next?
[17:52.50]I think so.
[17:54.36]Gold Rush.
[17:55.53]No.
[17:57.16]I love the, no.
[18:00.91]No, no more, please, please.
[18:03.08]I think I have like 2,000 hours in TF2.
[18:06.57]I would assume probably like 1,400 of them are on Gold Rush.
[18:10.17]Oh, yeah?
[18:11.22]Because they never end.
[18:12.62]They had a Dust Bowl.
[18:14.42]Who remembers the old Dust Bowl?
[18:16.05]The old school Dust Bowl.
[18:18.13]It was different.
[18:19.66]Back with the old spy animation.
[18:21.22]I remember I was one of the top spy players in the world back then.
[18:24.53]Back in like 2007.
[18:26.31]I'll tell you right now.
[18:27.08]I got the first ever recorded
[18:30.46]Nine chain backstab.
[18:32.44]What?
[18:33.24]Yeah, I have it recorded.
[18:34.76]Wow.
[18:35.44]It's on that website Wikipedia.
[18:37.67]Just type in my name, Jeremy Jerma, and you'll see it'll pop up.
[18:40.97]It's the first thing that pops up.
[18:44.22]On Bing, right?
[18:45.52]On Bing.
[18:46.02]Yeah, you've got to use Bing.
[18:47.30]It's not going to work.
[18:48.24]Not on Google.
[18:48.64]You can't find it on Google.
[18:50.43]They've been trying, but you can't do it.
[18:52.85]You've got to use Bing.
[18:54.37]No, I have a lot of time on some of these old maps.
[18:56.92]I love these maps.
[18:58.06]Yeah, it's classic.
[18:59.03]No, that's what I was saying yesterday.
[19:00.91]Whenever I'm seeing the pub gameplay on these classic maps, just the memories just flashing through, you know?
[19:06.97]There are a lot of them.
[19:09.81]We have a donation come in from Tactician.
[19:13.69]$50.
[19:14.98]Says, here's $50 for seeing jermaOn stream.
[19:18.32]I'll donate another $50 if Jerma does a callback to his old self and drinks a nice can of Dr. Pepper.
[19:27.25]Oh, Dr. Pepper?
[19:30.59]Who's coming to Walgreens?
[19:31.57]There's a Walgreens right down the road.
[19:33.36]Can we get Dr. Pepper in the studio, please?
[19:35.76]Can we get a Dr. Pepper in the studio, please?
[19:39.07]I am demanding a Dr. Pepper.
[19:41.77]I'm one of those divas that you didn't think I was a diva.
[19:44.42]I demand a Dr. Pepper.
[19:45.62]And excuse me, by the way, where are my only green M&Ms?
[19:50.54]In my hotel room, I asked for it, and I don't see it.
[19:53.97]I don't see only green M&Ms.
[19:56.89]I was promised.
[19:58.95]I mean, I said maybe.
[20:00.44]Where's my Captain Crunch?
[20:02.05]You never asked for that.
[20:03.92]You should have known.
[20:07.20]You should have just known.
[20:11.99]If we can get a Dr. Pepper in here, I would be glad to take a little sip.
[20:18.98]Dr. Pepper.
[20:19.82]I'm sure we can make that happen.
[20:22.54]Those are the days.
[20:24.39]I have a whole video on my channel where I just drink one.
[20:28.75]I drank a Dr. Pepper and almost throw up.
[20:31.68]And then the video ends.
[20:33.98]What a bad video.
[20:34.96]Wow, that sounds like a tag story.
[20:41.13]Isn't Tag in the studio?
[20:42.37]How about that?
[20:43.11]Hey, guys.
[20:44.54]How about all that?
[20:46.32]He's over there.
[20:47.34]He's playing the game.
[20:48.46]How's it going on the gamer table, guys?
[20:51.37]Reddit has a pretty good defense.
[20:53.73]It's pretty tough.
[20:54.27]We can't break them.
[20:55.23]Are they going up against Team Reddit?
[20:56.39]That's the Gold Rush story.
[20:57.71]Yeah, they're going against Reddit right now.
[20:59.25]Alright.
[20:59.58]This is Reddit.
[21:01.16]Alright.
[21:01.94]But George is definitely carrying the blue team.
[21:03.66]We have Jerma's dog playing.
[21:05.73]He's pretty good.
[21:07.33]He's pretty good.
[21:09.65]Pretty good.
[21:11.33]I wonder how many people right off the bat just instantly knew that this is definitely not me playing again.
[21:18.11]Even when you pressed W to move forward the first time, people were probably like, that ain't him.
[21:24.54]It takes Jerma at least three or four seconds to get out of spawn.
[21:27.67]Yeah, it started to look a little fishy when he hit four air pipes in a row.
[21:32.11]I know.
[21:32.91]He was like, bang, bang, bang.
[21:34.69]He's like, that was pretty good.
[21:36.00]You did a pretty good job there.
[21:38.60]That's so funny.
[21:39.98]yeah the new alias really working out for you we do have a seven dollar donation I want to get to from Mr. mitchell says I've watched since the first tip of the hats it's been a great experience every time massive amount of admiration for all you people doing it wish I could donate more but college has begun keep it up and like we mentioned before you know no donation is too small if everyone thought that as Mike so eloquently put
[22:02.56]then we wouldn't receive anything.
[22:04.04]So every donation counts, whether it's $100, $500, or $7.
[22:06.55]Mr. Mitchell, thank you very much.
[22:10.23]Thank you.
[22:10.96]Thank you very much, man.
[22:13.62]Everyone counts.
[22:14.28]Every dollar counts.
[22:16.91]Every dollar.
[22:18.59]Can I get a tally on the George side, please?
[22:30.05]Do we have a tally going?
[22:31.95]Can I be on the top?
[22:34.15]We have a chalkboard.
[22:35.13]Let's just start marking the board.
[22:37.75]How did I kill myself?
[22:39.60]What's the security posit on this place?
[22:40.92]Can we start, like, marking the back wall?
[22:48.85]Three seconds.
[22:50.11]Come on.
[22:51.21]Come on.
[22:52.14]Get on that cart.
[22:53.78]This is the part of the pub where the blue team is like, yeah, let's do the objective.
[22:57.11]And then they do it.
[22:58.26]Can they?
[22:58.98]The last 20 seconds.
[23:00.00]You're right.
[23:01.65]No.
[23:02.35]Nope.
[23:03.78]You thought that might happen, but then Zach picked Ruffle.
[23:07.29]That's Gold Rush.
[23:07.91]We're playing Gold Rush.
[23:10.19]That's Gold Rush.
[23:12.33]Man, Blue got Ruffle stomped there.
[23:15.50]It's funny that it's called Gold Rush, you know?
[23:17.96]Not much.
[23:18.48]You don't really go fast.
[23:19.66]Just kind of walk through choke and don't move.
[23:22.69]You're telling me.
[23:23.97]106 points for George.
[23:25.97]We've had multiple $100 donations come in.
[23:29.62]Want to get to them.
[23:30.90]One from It's Not Unusual says, here is $100.
[23:35.87]It would be nice to see Jerma do the Carlton dance.
[23:38.41]I'm sorry that they're picking me.
[23:40.60]The Carlton dance?
[23:41.80]Yes.
[23:42.32]Do you know what that is?
[23:43.04]I think I know what it is.
[23:44.04]I don't know how to do it.
[23:44.90]Is that when you go like this?
[23:46.32]Yep.
[23:47.56]I mean, he already gave you the money, so if you don't do it.
[23:50.70]I'll try it one more time.
[23:51.92]It's like this, right?
[23:52.75]It's like, it's not unusual to be loved by anyone.
[23:56.31]Perfect.
[23:58.20]You've got to sing the rest of it, though.
[23:59.74]It's not unusual.
[24:00.76]That's the only lyric I know from that song.
[24:02.33]I think that's the only lyrics anyone in the world knows.
[24:04.13]I'm pretty sure.
[24:04.47]I think you're right.
[24:05.59]If anyone knows the second part of those lyrics,
[24:08.16]Say it, because I probably shouldn't have said that.
[24:10.82]Now the whole chat's going to be like, what's his name?
[24:13.59]The chat's going to freak out.
[24:14.71]Dean Dingus, what's the guy's name that sang that song?
[24:17.25]Dean Dingus.
[24:18.60]What was his name?
[24:19.30]No, I think that's it.
[24:20.08]That's the official.
[24:21.64]Yeah, that's it.
[24:22.44]Just looked it up.
[24:23.92]Tom Grungus, what's his name?
[24:27.33]It's going to come to me, and I'm just going to yell it during the stream.
[24:29.87]Perfect.
[24:30.45]Halfway through, I'm just going to say his name.
[24:32.58]How about that?
[24:33.10]We're on some bad water.
[24:33.84]You like some bad water?
[24:34.76]I do love bad water.
[24:36.76]Classic.
[24:37.22]Best map ever.
[24:38.43]Classic map.
[24:40.75]It's like the only map that is that old but is still played super regularly, I think.
[24:47.64]It's so good.
[24:48.40]You know?
[24:49.28]Yeah, this is the original, isn't it?
[24:52.95]I think so.
[24:53.59]Or one of the original Gold Rush.
[24:55.73]No, I think it came out a little bit later.
[24:57.51]It was in an update.
[24:58.30]Badwater, yeah.
[24:59.38]Was it the Polycon update?
[25:00.62]No, it wasn't the Polycon update.
[25:02.02]It was before that.
[25:03.04]Oh, best update.
[25:03.40]It was one of the early, early updates to the game.
[25:06.77]But it's a classic map.
[25:07.97]I looked over for a second.
[25:08.91]I thought someone was coming to talk to Pepper.
[25:10.93]I was like, oh, no.
[25:12.42]I saw a body coming through my peripheral.
[25:14.34]I'm like, well, no, not quite.
[25:18.07]There's got to be someone on the way to get the Dr. Pepper.
[25:20.48]Somebody's like speeding right now, like stomping on their gas.
[25:26.41]Like their foot is touching the ground.
[25:28.61]You know what I mean?
[25:29.82]You ever done something like that?
[25:31.22]You ever touched the ground with your foot?
[25:32.62]Yeah.
[25:33.24]We got lost in the city two nights in a row.
[25:35.27]Yeah, and you'd wait all day long and you tell me what yeah, you go so bad at it like Don't ever do that by the way.

[27:09.45]He was going too fast.
[27:13.53]He needed to pull back a little there.
[27:15.28]I'm going to get the rocket jumper on.
[27:16.54]We can go for a real journey.

[27:21.99]There it is.
[27:23.79]Challenge accepted, ladies and gentlemen.
[27:30.05]We will be putting Sideshow in a box with a GoPro strapped to his head.
[27:36.85]And I guess that's good.
[27:37.89]We're going to throw him in a pool and see if he makes it out.
[27:42.50]It's everything I've ever dreamed of and more.
[27:49.00]Sideshow, are you ready for that?
[27:50.20]I am so ready for that.
[27:51.29]When are we doing it?
[27:51.89]Are we doing it now?
[27:52.83]I believe we're in a box now.
[27:54.03]Yeah, we are.
[27:54.75]We are doing it now.
[27:55.75]Get in that box.
[27:56.86]Confirm that, but... Where are they going to do this?
[27:58.84]Is there, like, a rum over there?
[28:00.36]They're going to step up in the corner.
[28:01.62]Well, that's half the battle.
[28:03.25]Yeah.
[28:03.83]He's going to be, like, squatting, like... He's not going to be able to do it.
[28:07.57]It's going to be a challenge.
[28:08.84]Don't knock over the set, please.
[28:11.06]We will be doing it now.
[28:13.46]Oh, boy, he's getting up.
[28:15.31]He's ready to go.
[28:15.95]We need someone to get on one of the cameras.
[28:18.03]Do you need help?
[28:19.93]I think he needs help to get in there, doesn't he?
[28:21.86]I think he needs medical assistance.
[28:23.50]Oh, look at that.
[28:23.86]There he is.
[28:26.80]The certified nurse is going to help him out here.
[28:34.33]He's got a goat.

[29:33.70]That would be something.
[29:34.60]We'll just sail out.
[29:35.47]Tip of the boat party.
[29:36.29]We'll sail out into the Pacific and host Tip of the Hats and see.
[29:40.71]That would be something.
[29:41.47]That sounds logistically sound.
[29:44.60]You're right.
[29:45.04]It doesn't sound dangerous.
[29:46.38]It's going to be weird to be on the dock, though.
[29:49.34]You know what I mean?
[29:49.94]Out on the dock.
[29:51.02]I don't know why in my head this is a big party boat.
[29:54.05]You know what I mean?
[29:54.73]It's got a huge dock.
[29:56.61]Mm-hmm.
[29:56.73]Everyone's out on there.
[29:58.35]We're all like our glasses.
[29:59.98]We're all like every 20 minutes.
[30:03.34]You know what I mean?
[30:04.63]Just for effect.
[30:05.61]Nothing in them.
[30:06.11]There's like water in them.
[30:07.37]So we just need to give Stabby about 200k to upgrade his boat.
[30:11.80]We're fine.
[30:12.77]Upgrade his boat.
[30:14.94]That $200, which I believe put us at that challenge from mismatches.
[30:19.13]Just the heart.
[30:20.27]Oh, thank you.
[30:20.95]Thanks.
[30:21.31]Heart.
[30:21.97]I heart you.
[30:22.65]Heart.
[30:23.78]All our subscribers, I want to see some hearts in the chat.
[30:26.30]Maybe some Toth hearts.
[30:27.63]Yeah, if you subscribe, that's another way of donating.
[30:30.21]That's absolutely right.
[30:31.17]I feel like I've said this, sorry, a million times, but I just need to say, the emotes for the channel are just so good.
[30:37.32]If you don't sub and if you've ever put an emote in a Twitch chat and you don't have the tip of the hat's emotes, you're missing out.
[30:42.60]Yeah, and if we get past a certain threshold, we might even get more.
[30:45.54]So the more subs, the more chances of new emotes.
[30:48.33]So get on that.
[30:49.81]And those are site wide.
[30:50.97]Remember that you can use those everywhere, not just here.
[30:54.45]And the proceeds, the profit that the channel receives
[30:59.74]We don't keep that.
[31:00.70]Tip of the Hats does not keep that.
[31:02.38]It continues to go to the one-step camp.
[31:05.07]So you can keep subscribing, and that will always go to the one-step camp.
[31:09.11]So if you want to sort of budget it that way, that's just a great way to support the camp continuing on.
[31:15.52]Yeah, absolutely.
[31:17.29]That's a good point.
[31:20.58]George.
[31:21.18]We're on George again.
[31:21.92]Continuing his reign of terror on this pub.
[31:23.87]My reign.
[31:25.49]People are rage quitting left and right.
[31:27.13]Look at that.
[31:28.75]Do we know who George is at the Gamertag?
[31:30.78]No.
[31:31.92]Do we care?
[31:32.58]Do we care who George is?
[31:34.86]Hold on.
[31:35.22]I've got to concentrate here.
[31:38.41]He's communicating to his dog.
[31:40.31]Ow.
[31:42.73]Come on.
[31:44.74]It's giving me a headache.
[31:45.84]Hold on.
[31:46.58]I've got to jump back here.
[31:47.96]It might help if you shouted out instructions and then...
[31:51.29]Go left.
[31:53.12]Go left.
[31:55.76]Okay.
[32:01.05]Every time I die, it's like a bunch of air riches I can lock my shoulders, you know?
[32:05.21]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:06.68]Then I get a second.
[32:07.40]Then I get back into it.
[32:08.60]Yep.
[32:11.58]Sideshow.
[32:12.92]Oh.
[32:13.15]You hate to see that happen.
[32:15.63]You hate to see that one happen.
[32:17.01]He exploded.
[32:18.80]I'm not very good at this game.
[32:20.22]And stabby.
[32:21.44]Check this guy out.
[32:22.47]He's near a staircase, too.
[32:23.83]Golden knife?
[32:26.55]And he has the golden gap.
[32:28.33]He's going to blast you.
[32:29.11]He's got the golden watch.
[32:31.74]Oh, my God.
[32:32.54]He's got the golden watch, too.
[32:34.50]That's solid gold.
[32:35.80]Wow.
[32:36.91]That's pretty rare.
[32:38.29]When the economy falls apart, just invest in solid gold like stabby stabby, and you can just keep that.
[32:46.24]Look at that headshot.
[32:47.42]Wow.
[32:48.30]Two in a row?
[32:48.84]Make it two in a row?
[32:50.41]What?
[32:51.63]Is that me?
[32:52.79]He didn't want to BM.
[32:53.65]He didn't want to BM.
[32:54.38]He wanted to get a fair and square.
[32:57.46]Well, it is for the kids.
[32:59.37]Look at this.
[33:00.31]I think he's wall hacking, guys.
[33:02.23]How did he know that sniper was there?
[33:03.77]I think this guy's cheating.
[33:05.93]Oh, no.
[33:07.37]He's setting up a matador right now.
[33:09.30]He's setting up a matador.
[33:10.66]Don't do it.
[33:11.28]Inverse stairs.
[33:12.32]Inverse matadors.
[33:13.60]Oh, my God.
[33:17.39]What was that little spin?
[33:19.65]What?
[33:20.66]He baited him.
[33:22.10]That guy took a page out of Lang's playbook with the ham shank.
[33:25.14]Started to whack him with some wet ham.
[33:26.97]What was that spin?
[33:28.07]He did, like, a 360 spin and just, like, turned back around.
[33:31.63]I don't know, but he got him.
[33:32.78]He tricked him.
[33:33.36]Stabby, what was that?
[33:34.30]I want you to see... I want to do it again.
[33:37.94]I want you to see the... That's all, folks.
[33:42.13]We have a $30 donation from Walf.
[33:45.55]W-A-L-F says, this is all I have at the moment, but I'll buy a Toth shirt for sure as well.
[33:51.30]Keep up the great work.
[33:52.86]And we want to remind everybody that at home, if you click under the stream, you can get in on our Teespring campaign.
[33:59.89]I believe they are $25.
[34:01.45]And the person who designed our emotes, Jasmine, she also designed the shirt.
[34:06.16]And they are absolutely beautiful.
[34:07.70]We have one on the table here.
[34:08.90]We have them up behind us.
[34:10.04]And we can see two of our members on the couch here are also wearing them.
[34:14.21]That's a great opportunity and another great way to continue to show your support.
[34:17.55]And if you've never gotten a shirt from Teespring before with a Twitch campaign or anything like that, they're actually incredibly comfortable T-shirts.
[34:24.24]Oh, yeah.
[34:24.92]They are awesome.
[34:25.68]It's no joke.
[34:26.32]It's not like they just screen print onto some regular kind of like... You put it in the wash once and it falls apart.
[34:32.57]This thing went off the rack, you know what I mean?
[34:34.36]You know how you get the shirt off the rack?
[34:36.18]This is not a rack shirt.
[34:38.21]They actually are incredibly comfortable.
[34:40.92]Highly recommended.
[34:42.90]It is a very good shirt.
[34:44.47]Yeah, I wonder how many we've sold so far.
[34:46.61]Last time I checked, it was over 350.
[34:48.43]Three million.
[34:50.65]No, that's not true.
[34:52.05]Don't listen to that guy.
[34:55.74]That is a lie.
[34:56.38]They would need to hire like 60,000 more staff.
[34:59.22]Oh, this is a classic move.
[35:00.40]The classic kill the Engineer.
[35:01.69]I learned that move from Icy Toonie.
[35:04.99]Come on.
[35:06.33]Speaking of classic, that's a classic.
[35:07.95]I haven't heard that name in a while.
[35:11.68]Oh, the stair stab.
[35:13.89]Oh, boy.
[35:15.41]I'm still alive.
[35:17.35]I need to cool off after that one.
[35:19.76]How do you play this guy?
[35:21.06]How do you do this?
[35:22.00]We get $100 for every stair stab he's going to get.
[35:24.68]We're going to have millions of dollars here.
[35:26.59]Can I get a little price match there?
[35:28.33]Does anybody else want to see how fast Stabby can tie his shoes?
[35:31.37]I feel like it's wicked fast.
[35:33.77]It takes me a good solid minute on each shoe.
[35:35.48]That'll be a donation incentive for Toth Boat Edition.
[35:38.36]That's not true either.
[35:39.88]It is.
[35:40.54]A lot of lies here on the couch today.
[35:42.81]We got a bunch of liars.
[35:44.08]Sammy just tele-fragged someone.
[35:45.38]The classic tele-frag.
[35:46.69]I want to see him tie his shoes.
[35:47.83]I bet you he does it like in two seconds.
[35:51.00]Did he just get kicked from the server?
[35:54.09]No, he died.
[35:54.83]There was no ragdoll.
[35:56.54]He dead ringered but died at the exact same time.
[36:01.23]I thought he got disconnected too.
[36:03.59]I thought he just left.
[36:04.97]Ooh, sideshow with a body shot.
[36:06.72]Nice one.
[36:08.10]Body shot noob.
[36:09.22]Hey.
[36:10.65]there's another one sometimes you gotta go for the shoulder okay guys the support we're getting right now is just absolutely incredible I'm being told that we have sold 360 shirts so wow you know keep those coming uh 360 people out there will be receiving awesome shirts but also the donations that are coming in are incredible we have 100 from an artichoke says can we get some smiles in chat I'm sure we can thank you for the kids perfect request thanks already 75 from crowley
[36:36.57]says, tip of the hats is a staple of TF2 for a good reason.
[36:41.27]This event unites the community every year and it's glorious.
[36:44.39]Thank you for doing this again and I look forward to many more years.
[36:47.26]Also, is this sponsored by fruit?
[36:50.40]Eat it up.
[36:51.36]And that was in caps, eat it up.
[36:54.40]Why do you think I've been holding this the whole time?
[36:56.78]I haven't put it down.
[36:58.55]I'm legally required to hold this.
[37:01.03]If I put this down, two grand comes out of my bank account.
[37:04.89]I just did it.
[37:07.14]Hopefully that's going to tip of the hats.
[37:09.55]Yes!
[37:10.99]Hey, fruit?
[37:12.59]Fruit.
[37:13.35]Take that two bread and dunk it into this bank account.
[37:16.98]The big one.
[37:18.10]The 94k one.
[37:19.66]Maybe put it to the ulti duo switch mice donation incentive.
[37:23.53]That one's still coming up.
[37:24.47]Yeah, I actually want to see that.
[37:25.61]That's going to be good.
[37:26.43]Yeah, we do have, now that we have reached the sideshow incentive.
[37:30.20]The next one coming up is the ulti duo where I believe the medic and the soldier, they sort of swap hands a little bit and they each control each other's mice while continuing to control their own keyboards.
[37:42.34]Yes.
[37:42.94]So... That's never going to work.
[37:48.71]Figure that out.
[37:51.78]We'll be playing Twister at the same time.
[37:54.28]It's like doing like a secret handshake.
[38:00.51]I mean, you could just connect the USBs.
[38:04.86]But you could do the secret handshake too.
[38:06.78]I kind of like the secret handshake.
[38:07.90]Yeah, I think that's better.
[38:08.66]I think it works.
[38:09.48]What's going on there?
[38:11.38]Those guys aren't playing with each other.
[38:12.63]What happened to pubbing?
[38:15.71]They're just dancing now.
[38:16.81]Almost got that mini.
[38:19.66]Almost.
[38:20.55]Yeah.
[38:21.45]Come on, George!
[38:22.40]George coming through again for the blue squadrons.
[38:28.21]Now, I mentioned at the beginning that I wanted to get to 100k by the end of the night, but we are already on track of breaking 95 by the end of this segment, so it'd be great if we can do that.
[38:37.08]We do have some donations, big donations coming in.
[38:40.04]One from Fashi says, Jerma, glad you can make it out this year.
[38:44.77]You are a solid block of charisma, and I love watching your jokes and antics almost as much as I hate cancer.
[38:51.35]And as always, thanks to all the other great community folks who have stuck with the great game for all these years.
[38:58.20]Thank you, Fashi, for the 100 bucks.
[39:00.62]Of course, it's going to One Step Camp, which if you guys don't know, if you have just clicked on the stream, you have no idea what's happening.
[39:07.71]You see apples.
[39:08.81]You see crazy pubbing from George.
[39:11.17]We are holding this for the One Step Camp for Children's Oncology Services.
[39:16.06]Every bit of money that we make will go to them, and they will send kids to camp where they can try to recapture and reclaim what it means to be a child, where they don't have to worry about the treatment that they're receiving.
[39:27.73]where they can meet others like them and build a community and build friendship.
[39:31.36]And I think we keep talking about this every time that I sit down.
[39:34.21]As gamers, you know, we're all about friendship.
[39:36.06]We're all about community.
[39:37.36]And it's something we can really get behind.
[39:39.13]Absolutely.
[39:41.18]I said this years ago that it was incredible that even like $10,000 or $20,000, $30,000, people are so generous, like passing $100,000, that's so much money.
[39:54.79]It means so much to these kids.
[39:56.12]I'm glad people really care.
[39:58.08]Yeah.
[39:58.52]It's good to see it.
[39:59.52]Absolutely.
[40:00.46]Now, what is that on Stabby's chest?
[40:02.12]That's my next big question in life, in our existence.
[40:06.55]Now, what is that?
[40:07.45]I believe that is a jaunty pin with a duck over it.
[40:13.27]Interesting.
[40:14.25]That had me thrown for a loop.
[40:18.56]Let's see what Stabby does.
[40:20.67]I think he's going to backstab someone.
[40:24.14]Yeah.
[40:25.16]We'll see.
[40:25.44]You think it's going to be a trick stab or a back stab?
[40:27.17]I don't think he's going to back stab anybody.
[40:28.15]Oh, that was almost incredible.
[40:29.71]Almost got the matador.
[40:30.73]Almost.
[40:31.35]Man, look at the kill feed.
[40:32.77]George is just going crazy.
[40:35.13]He is.
[40:35.67]Maybe this George guy might finally be able to find an ESEA invite team on Roamer, you know?
[40:41.42]He keeps looking, but maybe he'll be able to finally find one.
[40:45.76]Maybe he'll find a team.
[40:50.09]Well.
[40:51.11]There you go.
[40:51.79]Well, that's Badwater.
[40:52.69]One team win.
[40:53.61]Where are they going now?
[40:54.37]Anywhere?
[40:54.87]They won.
[40:55.45]Badwater.
[40:56.32]I think they're switching teams.
[40:57.96]I hope it goes to DeGroot Keep.
[40:59.34]Why don't they just go to Man Manor for once?
[41:01.32]How about TC Hydro?
[41:03.49]That's a classic.
[41:04.15]Right?
[41:04.89]Go to TC Hydro.
[41:05.99]Man Manor.
[41:06.59]Man Manor, Mountain Lab, that is a... I like Mountain Lab.
[41:10.08]It's the same thing.
[41:10.78]It's got to be Man Manor.
[41:11.80]It's the same thing.
[41:12.30]There's no spooky Halloween Manor in our realm.
[41:14.28]That is true.
[41:14.60]That is true.
[41:15.22]No explosive pumpkins.
[41:17.37]Either way, it's a good map layup.
[41:21.23]Yeah, I used to love that map.
[41:23.09]Map layout is fantastic, I think.
[41:25.88]$100.
[41:26.42]I'm sorry.
[41:27.98]$100 from Kevin Ispone says, I love watching Tip of the Hats every year.
[41:33.57]You guys are putting on a fantastic show for a beautiful cause.
[41:36.53]Thanks for the great event for us now, and thanks for giving kids a great event in the future.
[41:41.40]Hashtag for the kids.
[41:44.43]Thank you, Kevin.
[41:45.23]Thank you, Kevin.
[41:46.82]Kevin the Poner.
[41:48.00]He really is.
[41:49.66]He's been trying to stop for years, but he just can't stop.
[41:54.93]He's so good at it.
[41:57.67]He can't stop doing what you're that good at.
[42:02.61]Let's see what Ozzy does here.
[42:03.82]That's what I'm looking forward to seeing.
[42:05.48]The rocket jumper.
[42:06.28]Did they change how that looks?
[42:07.52]Yes, they did.
[42:08.14]Add a little triangle.
[42:09.66]There's a little stop knob on it.
[42:12.39]Yeah, there is a little knob.
[42:13.61]Has a new sound and everything.
[42:14.88]When did they do that?
[42:15.44]It's like a plunger, yeah.
[42:17.10]I don't know.
[42:17.85]A couple months ago, I think.
[42:18.87]Really?
[42:19.51]Yeah.
[42:20.09]Man.
[42:20.98]Ooh.
[42:21.36]Wow.
[42:22.76]Ooh.
[42:27.26]there he is sorry wow wow sorry coming from everyone with uh headphones at home rest in peace stream rest in peace to those uh speaker users every single person rip subwoofer users rip audio device users oh man
[42:55.98]Speaking of subwoofer, that subwoofer in the other room, we can watch the stream.
[43:02.39]We have another room where we're watching the stream.
[43:04.15]There's a subwoofer in there.
[43:05.81]It's known to actually shake the building.
[43:09.40]Guys, I think the building is shaking.
[43:11.68]Well, let me tell you why.
[43:12.88]That subwoofer is about to bring the whole hotel down.
[43:15.44]Let's turn it up.
[43:17.05]Turn the thing up as loud as it can go and just stop rocking out.
[43:22.01]What would happen?
[43:22.99]Will we get in trouble?
[43:23.91]We'll get on national news, I hope.
[43:25.54]Yeah.
[43:26.49]This just in, local charity event is rocking out on the fourth floor.
[43:31.04]Where are we?
[43:32.44]On like the 90th floor?
[43:34.68]We're on the third floor right now.
[43:35.57]We're on the third floor?
[43:36.39]I thought we were on like the floor at like 60.
[43:38.85]You're on like the 24th floor.
[43:41.35]Oh.
[43:42.30]Well, how would he know?
[43:42.88]He just appeared out of nowhere.
[43:44.06]He appeared through some sort of vortex.
[43:45.30]I just walked over here.
[43:47.30]Yeah, that's true.
[43:48.28]I found my way over here.
[43:49.31]I thought we were on like, you know, I thought it was like the Tower of Terror.
[43:51.39]You're in Chicago, by the way.
[43:52.73]Yeah.
[43:54.88]There's windows behind us, you can look out.
[43:58.16]Lake Michigan, not very far.
[44:08.76]Hey!
[44:10.24]Thought we were in Manchester, New Hampshire!
[44:13.32]Apparently not, I got a long drive!
[44:19.55]We're just having a couple of goofs on the couch, guys.
[44:22.09]No big deal.

[44:24.68]Sponsored by Froot.
[44:26.48]Well, of course, we do have the Ulti Duo event that will be coming up in the next segment.
[44:30.93]Yes.
[44:31.38]That should be exciting.
[44:33.52]Yes.
[44:34.38]I'm playing.
[44:37.58]You're playing.
[44:38.27]I'm playing.
[44:38.85]He's playing.
[44:40.01]I think I'll be playing.
[44:40.63]Sideshow's playing.
[44:41.67]Be careful of this guy.
[44:42.59]George is playing, I think.
[44:44.35]He's replacing Tag.
[44:45.93]George is going to be playing.
[44:47.11]George is better than Tag.
[44:48.06]I'm looking forward to that.
[44:48.82]You're right.
[44:51.04]We have Mr. Slime, and we have Admirable.
[44:56.58]I think that's everyone.
[44:57.30]I don't even know who I would want to pick, who's going to win that, especially though you're playing Twister now.
[45:01.77]Well, you'll be sticking around, right, Jeremy?
[45:03.41]You'll be here.
[45:04.23]Oh, yeah.
[45:04.49]I'll be hanging out.
[45:05.02]Whatever.
[45:05.40]I'll be around.
[45:06.26]If anyone wants to, I'll be sitting.
[45:08.16]I'll be standing.
[45:09.68]Sitting and or standing.
[45:11.09]Wow.
[45:11.71]Either one of those two.
[45:12.23]That's pretty impressive.
[45:13.47]Well, it's great that you could stop by.
[45:15.25]Thanks to our guests on the couch right now.
[45:18.80]But we are going to wrap it up.
[45:19.66]We are going to throw it to a short break.
[45:22.25]We will be right back with the Ulti Duo coming up.
[45:24.73]Don't go anywhere.
[45:26.01]We will be back.
