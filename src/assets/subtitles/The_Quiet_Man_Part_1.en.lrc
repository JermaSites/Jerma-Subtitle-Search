[00:02.25]Teartail is my favorite game ever made.
[00:04.89]Hey guys.
[00:07.86]How you doing?
[00:10.70]Hopefully things are going well.
[00:14.46]Mmm.
[00:15.78]That is banana.
[00:16.95]That is peanut butter.
[00:18.17]And that is almond milk.
[00:21.39]One, two, three.
[00:22.99]The trifecta.
[00:28.34]Hey, Jeremy, what's the latest smoothie that you're drinking right now?
[00:32.04]Because every six months you talk about a smoothie.
[00:34.22]Well, hold on a minute here.
[00:35.85]Banana.
[00:37.41]One banana.
[00:39.45]Two scoops of peanut butter.
[00:41.61]Almond milk.
[00:45.39]Into a glass.
[00:47.07]Slurp it up.
[00:52.61]I got coffee here too.
[00:53.50]I got a peanut butter banana smoothie and I got a coffee.
[01:02.56]That was a blender, yeah.
[01:04.54]Am I doing well?
[01:05.12]I'm doing well.
[01:06.60]I'm doing good.
[01:07.98]I'm doing good.
[01:10.42]So tonight, we're going to play a game called The Quiet Man, which is a Square Enix game.
[01:19.36]Kind of flew under the radar here for me, but it's an FMV game that is also not an FMV game.
[01:29.44]I don't, it's like an action game with choices and you play, uh, the main character is deaf.
[01:36.25]So I, I don't, I don't, you can't like hear, I don't know.
[01:40.77]Um, it is apparently awful.
[01:44.98]But I, it looked pretty, it looked like I had to play it.
[01:49.42]We'll just put it that way.
[02:00.49]This game isn't fun bad, it's bad bad.
[02:03.23]Well... We'll have to... I'm gonna stomach through it.
[02:08.13]I don't think it's more than... I think it's only three or four hours long.
[02:12.40]That's... Let's just do it, right?
[02:13.98]Should I... Am I gonna be able to do this?
[02:16.48]Or will I give up?
[02:24.44]The game isn't fun at all.
[02:32.21]But here's something about... Let's get out of here.
[02:34.77]Let's take a look at this.
[02:36.27]Here's the menu.
[02:38.19]Alright, so this is one of the menus.
[02:39.91]Look at this menu.
[02:46.16]I have any idea what this shit is.
[02:55.60]When I first loaded the game, it said, this is subtitles, and they're on.
[03:01.80]This is supposed to be difficulty.
[03:03.40]So I think this is mom yelling at little kid who's scared, but then this is normal mode.
[03:10.13]This is hard mode where little kid gets a Mario mushroom and screams at mom.
[03:17.25]I don't know how this means that it's harder.
[03:22.90]Like is this supposed to be me in this scenario and this is the game?
[03:27.42]Shouldn't it be the other way around?
[03:28.46]Or is this supposed to be me and this is the game?
[03:34.09]But anyway, I don't... I have no idea what this is.
[03:38.10]They didn't tell me what this was.
[03:40.46]It's just... It's just a group of people that are highlighted now.
[03:47.09]I don't know what this is.
[03:50.71]Door?
[03:53.91]What do you mean, door?
[03:58.54]Just hit play?
[04:09.63]What do you mean by door?
[04:14.84]Hold on.
[04:15.20]Kim is like texting me.
[04:16.62]Hold on a second.
[04:59.38]I ran down there and she kept saying, door.
[05:03.22]She was pointing at the door.
[05:05.84]I was like, okay.
[05:07.78]I opened the door and there was nothing there.
[05:13.61]Anyways, let's play.
[05:14.25]This is the Quiet Man.
[05:21.53]I think it's in the right settings.
[05:22.77]I'm just going to press play.
[05:26.96]Door, bottom right.
[05:39.91]Alright, alright, let's go Seattle 1998 New York, I mean Is this Spider-Man?
[06:04.77]Spider- Full Motion Video Experience
[06:12.11]That's me.
[06:12.43]I've got the black Spider-Man suit on.
[06:14.10]I've got the Venom suit on.
[06:27.21]Wait, isn't this how Infamous starts?
[06:29.89]A prototype.
[06:32.63]I like that hair.
[06:33.37]That's good hair.
[06:34.85]He's got great hair.
[06:45.37]This is a Square Enix game, by the way.
[06:48.37]I don't know what they had to do with this, but they apparently published it.
[06:51.94]Or maybe they made it, I don't know.
[06:56.46]Do I get to control the character?
[07:11.70]Why is the guy not talking?
[07:14.54]Why is he just putting his sandwich in a bag?
[07:17.00]I didn't even order anything.
[07:17.92]This guy is just getting his lunch ready.
[07:24.64]Quiet.
[07:36.40]It's the sound.
[07:37.08]Does it make it quiet?
[07:38.45]Oh, shit.
[07:39.19]I'll turn it off.
[07:39.79]I'll turn it off.
[07:41.19]I'll turn it off.
[07:49.57]Oh, peanut butter and jelly again?
[07:50.94]Ugh, dad.
[07:53.32]Can I at least get some tuna fish next time?
[07:55.54]Remember that.
[07:55.88]Write that down.
[07:56.82]That's a map.
[07:57.22]Now this guy steps to my lady and says, mmm.
[08:03.16]Wait.
[08:03.48]Mmm.
[08:03.74]Melo pelas.
[08:24.48]Where'd the subtitles go?
[08:33.24]Why am I walking down this alley right now?
[08:35.55]Is there a reason why I'm doing this?
[08:40.97]Am I like a crime fighter?
[08:46.83]I don't understand.
[08:47.87]What am I doing?
[08:50.39]Am I like trying to find back alleyways of people doing things wrong?
[08:55.06]These guys are just sitting around talking.
[09:06.54]Okay, here we go.
[09:10.83]What do I do?
[09:11.61]Do I have to press a button?
[09:13.69]Do I press a button?
[09:17.09]Am I supposed to punch?
[09:19.64]I didn't do any of that.
[09:28.24]Am I a robot?
[09:30.60]I'm a robot built by someone to patrol or something.
[09:46.15]Now we're no longer a full motion video game.
[09:50.19]Now we're CG.
[09:53.07]How do I throw punches?
[09:56.21]Who do I target?
[09:58.42]What?
[09:59.72]Ow!
[10:00.34]Ow, I'm being electrocuted.
[10:01.98]This is immersion.
[10:02.96]What?
[10:04.24]No, it's got the controller.
[10:05.50]It's got the controller.
[10:09.56]How do I punch?
[10:21.49]It didn't even tell me how to play the game!
[10:27.35]Okay, um... That's it.
[10:30.47]I did it.
[10:42.08]Where's my tutorial?
[10:52.60]Where are my- Weren't we just in full motion video?
[11:04.06]Why did we downgrade?
[11:06.98]Is there a reason why the graphics is downgraded?
[11:09.93]Well wouldn't this be- This would cost more money!
[11:12.75]Doing full CG animations.
[11:14.27]This costs more money than getting actors to act in front of a camera.
[11:19.23]Options.
[11:22.10]Why does it give me the options menu?
[11:23.54]Why are they watching a TV channel with options menu?
[11:26.94]Were they just playing Call of Duty and had to stop because I came in?
[11:29.38]I don't understand.
[11:34.80]I think I lost.
[11:41.51]This is- I don't like this.
[11:50.95]This is weird.
[11:56.64]Great stock footage.
[11:58.95]What?
[12:01.37]Okay, so they have stock footage like hello, baby.
[12:04.49]I'm like kissing you.
[12:05.45]Hi, baby.
[12:06.97]I'm a baby in a crib.
[12:08.53]Okay, there's a dodge.
[12:12.96]It's not very useful.
[12:19.16]At least I have like a super dash.
[12:24.08]Is there anything else I can do?
[12:24.92]Oh, there's a grab.
[12:32.49]Can I lock?
[12:33.07]What the fuck is happening?
[12:37.77]Okay, left trigger activates quiet mode or something.
[12:45.33]Oh, that's right, it is on hard.
[12:48.94]This is not, I didn't, this lower frame rate is proving to you that I'm not playing the game anymore.
[12:54.42]This is a rendered, full rendered motion.
[13:06.93]What the fuck are you showing me?
[13:14.23]What?
[13:19.26]Oh, this is... Okay, I get it.
[13:22.82]It's the controls.
[13:25.32]I see, okay.
[13:29.12]So, X is punch.
[13:32.23]A is dodge.
[13:35.82]Wait, what is that?
[13:36.64]If you dodge perfectly, then you get to punch him.
[13:40.82]V is also punch.
[13:43.34]Somehow.
[13:45.10]Why is kick?
[13:46.22]But why was grab?
[13:50.32]This is super mode.
[13:51.60]This is sprint.
[13:59.83]Oh, no.
[14:03.57]No, that's not what I wanted to do.
[14:05.09]How do I get out of this?
[14:05.93]No.
[14:09.72]Okay.
[14:12.26]The end.
[14:12.56]You beat it.
[14:14.22]So there's a sprint.
[14:20.20]I don't know where I'm supposed to be going.
[14:35.57]Here we are.
[14:36.59]Back in time, I guess.
[14:38.23]Is that me?
[14:45.95]That's supposed to be me.
[14:51.48]That guy did a pretty good green screen.
[14:52.82]That guy did.
[14:53.30]You know, I mean, you stand in front of a green screen and you make a bunch of sh- and all of a sudden, like, now everybody wants to do it.
[15:04.08]Is there a lock-on?
[15:06.47]I don't think there is.
[15:07.09]I'm pretty sure there's no lock on.
[15:16.44]This has to be getting to a point where I can do something else, right?
[15:20.40]Why are you watching me crying?
[15:28.36]Why?
[15:29.26]Why is it superimposing this shit on the screen?
[15:40.89]What's going on?
[15:41.44]I don't even know what to say.
[15:47.14]I have nothing to say.
[15:53.97]I thought we might have some stuff to talk about here, but we don't.
[15:58.61]We just don't.
[15:59.26]I'm beating the whole game, by the way.
[16:13.98]Can you please play something else?
[16:15.38]Not yet.
[16:24.22]Nice, I got him in the top.
[16:25.24]I did that.
[16:36.17]I just got an achievement that says, oh, what to say.
[16:38.25]I don't know what to say.
[16:42.27]I don't know who we are.
[16:43.75]I don't know why we're doing this.
[16:46.53]I don't know.
[16:46.97]All I know is we got lunch in a bag.
[16:48.59]That's it.
[16:56.06]I was given a bag lunch.
[17:00.46]Club... Club Normies.
[17:12.10]No, we're good.
[17:22.55]Jeremy, can you turn the game up?
[17:23.81]I can't hear it.
[17:24.87]I can't hear it either.
[17:36.16]How am I supposed to make decisions?
[17:38.93]Should I make decisions?
[17:41.68]I can't make any decisions.
[17:48.81]Well, that's mine now.
[17:53.05]Dub it.
[17:53.55]Okay.
[17:53.81]I can't think of anything.
[18:03.12]Hold on.
[18:03.52]I've got to take this.
[18:07.46]I was just lip-matching him.
[18:12.11]Alright, here we go.
[18:41.28]20... Let's see... 40... 60...
[19:09.20]$100.
[19:09.38]There it is in the case.
[19:12.84]Oh, you made it here finally.
[19:15.04]Didn't think you were going to show up.
[19:20.41]Lost out there somewhere?
[19:24.23]$25.
[19:27.05]$50.
[19:29.59]Here, $50.
[19:29.73]Here's all the money we took in from.
[19:31.65]Oh, a briefcase.
[19:32.97]Is that new?
[19:34.51]Wow.
[19:42.71]And you were the only person to remember my birthday.
[19:49.70]And I love Coke.
[19:51.88]I'm really glad you got this for me.
[19:53.56]Anyone watch you bring this in?
[19:56.96]I mean... Right on the chin.
[20:00.38]Me and you are going to do it together right now.
[20:03.01]Right.
[20:07.07]Anyways...
[20:12.31]Mmm.
[20:16.14]Yeah.
[20:21.54]Let me take a look.
[20:22.71]Well, I know them, yeah.
[20:24.69]I actually was there when he drew it.
[20:28.43]I told him it looked like shit, but he didn't want to correct it.
[20:31.90]I told him it should look more like a Jackson Pollock painting than anything else, but he didn't want to listen.
[20:38.52]What a fucking idiot, you know what I mean?
[20:40.81]But you, you could do a much... Hey.
[20:47.24]I'm trying to help you here.
[20:48.92]If you ever run to the gym, we're supposed to be doing this coke right now, and you are going to rip the phone out of my hand?
[20:53.76]That's unbelievable.
[20:56.10]It's my fucking birthday, man.
[21:01.28]Anyway.
[21:07.46]You know, if you want to go on a date with me, now is the time to say it.
[21:12.81]Hmm.
[21:13.61]It's right up there.
[21:15.29]Oh, man.
[21:15.77]The body of the mother of Christ compels us.
[21:19.39]Remember when we were kids?
[21:26.68]I've got your shoes!
[21:35.10]Give me my shoes back!
[21:36.16]No, they're mine!
[21:37.00]I've got to help someone.
[21:41.35]Hold on.
[21:42.25]Hey!
[21:47.32]Alright.
[21:49.11]Yeah, those shoes.
[21:51.05]They were expensive.
[21:52.29]Very expensive.
[21:53.07]And I'm glad that you came over there and screamed at them.
[21:55.07]But it didn't really help that much.
[21:58.79]Ow!
[21:59.05]I just broke my finger!
[22:00.01]It's alright.
[22:02.03]These motherfuckers are strong.
[22:07.16]Yeah.
[22:08.48]To you, to us.
[22:18.51]I'll meet you outside.
[22:32.68]Five million.
[22:40.66]This is way harder.
[22:42.02]This is hard.
[22:44.26]Have a look.
[22:55.23]What do you think?
[22:57.91]I was thinking of sending it to her.
[23:00.31]You know, in case she ever wanted to see her kids again.
[23:04.76]You know, what do you think?
[23:05.38]Is it too much?
[23:07.10]Yeah, I think it might be.
[23:12.30]Took me a long time to make it, though.
[23:15.87]I'm in the business of ransom.
[23:18.43]It's just, you know, not easy.
[23:24.69]Maybe you could go there and convince them.
[23:29.04]Yeah, I don't know.
[23:30.26]You're the one with the superpowers.
[23:32.10]I don't have any superpowers.
[23:33.18]Come on.
[23:34.22]I just wanted to make a couple extra dollars.
[23:36.40]Make some more millions.
[23:40.09]Press 1 for refund.
[23:42.61]Play for one hour and then refund.
[23:44.29]No.
[23:53.50]Oh, I wish I had, like, other items here.
[23:56.58]How long do I think I can hold it here before I burn my hand?
[23:59.31]I'm gonna say probably ten seconds.
[24:01.61]And that's why I say... Eh, I don't know.
[24:05.93]I burnt my hand already.
[24:07.77]Were you thinking about something?
[24:10.07]I just can't even imagine.
[24:12.06]You know what's really... Let me tell you something.
[24:13.24]You know what really pisses me off lately?
[24:15.40]The whole... I mean, it's not even Thanksgiving.
[24:18.24]And... I mean, I see... I see...
[24:23.14]hold on words with friends just popped up I am the pretty much number one in the region of words with friends so sorry I'm gonna take an extra minute here Christmas decorations you know what I'm saying I want to punch them I'd love I'd love to punch a Christmas decoration in the
[24:48.33]Face, you know what I'm saying?
[24:49.29]Like, right in the face.
[24:51.07]Oh, with a shovel.
[24:52.69]Or a rock.
[24:56.07]Not even Thanksgiving yet.
[25:00.57]You know, a rope maybe?
[25:02.65]Sprangle?
[25:04.01]Mm-hmm.
[25:06.01]Yeah.
[25:06.85]You and me.
[25:08.61]We're gonna go vandalize Christmas decoration.
[25:13.87]Why is this?
[25:27.89]I want you to imagine this if there wasn't a dub here.
[25:32.79]It's a five minute silent cutscene.
[25:44.04]What does it want me to do?
[25:46.42]Oh, go over to the flowers.
[25:48.02]Am I going to eat them?
[25:51.58]Is this actually supposed to be muted?
[25:52.82]Yeah.
[25:53.48]What is this?
[25:59.67]Turn up the volume.
[26:01.01]There is no volume.
[26:02.86]That's like the point of the whole game.
[26:05.24]There is no sound.
[26:06.24]It's not that I have the volume turned down.
[26:11.16]There is no volume.
[26:15.00]Turn on subtitles.
[26:15.90]They're already on.
[26:17.22]But there's a splash screen at the beginning of the game that says, Hey, subtitles are on, but you're not going to see them unless it's in a specific situation where you can actually hear them.
[26:28.31]Wow, the iPhone sure did get fucking good.
[26:31.91]That was the best photo I think I've ever seen.
[26:34.16]That's like iPhone 16.
[26:43.85]Again, I'm going to reiterate this point one more time.
[26:46.97]Go to a stock footage site and type in, like, woman smiling in bed.
[26:54.14]or makeup commercial or toothpaste commercial one of those three will do I was I was specifically told before the stream started
[27:19.99]Do not play this game.
[27:22.01]It's not funny.
[27:23.49]It's just... It's just not even good.
[27:25.57]But... I... Whoa, we're going over for free?
[27:40.45]What if I just don't move?
[27:45.11]Alright, those are the moves you make when your cat's going crazy and you're like afraid of what it's going to do next.
[27:55.05]That's somebody that, there's like a cat or a dog in the room and they're like, oh, oh, oh, hold on.
[28:06.84]Those are the moves you made during the green screen.
[28:13.19]Well, you guys know what to do.
[28:15.56]Hey!
[28:16.26]You gotta pay for that!
[28:22.65]Grab, throw.
[28:24.41]That was a pretty nice knee.
[28:28.71]This won the Golden Joystick Award over Red Dead.
[28:32.39]No, it did not.
[28:36.98]It did not.
[28:38.62]I'm sorry to say.
[28:39.78]It's the same two moves.
[28:46.47]What?
[28:46.79]He got back up?
[28:48.85]Why is he getting back up?
[28:49.95]Uh-oh, now he has a saw!
[28:54.24]Uh, oh wait, I thought this was still in the subway.
[29:37.23]I'm not dubbing this scene, okay?
[29:52.98]Lazy streamer.
[29:54.22]No, I can't.
[29:55.41]Lame?
[29:56.05]What?
[29:57.03]Are you serious?
[29:58.87]Are you serious?
[30:06.57]Well, I get to be the only person that's ever beaten this game on stream.
[30:11.05]Do you think that's a 100% guarantee?
[30:16.42]Maybe I'll get invited to Square Enix's next, like, launch party.
[30:25.78]That was pretty nice.
[30:26.52]Dude, this is just a wrestling game.
[30:32.23]He's gotten four sweet chin musics in a row.
[30:34.79]He should be done.
[30:37.10]Oh, he has a knife.
[30:46.95]Can I pick up the machete?
[30:57.76]What, just... Now all of a sudden you can block?
[31:05.79]These are identical to my green screen kicks.
[31:14.89]Is this a boss?
[31:15.69]This is a boss, isn't it?
[31:24.33]Now we gotta wait for the train.
[31:26.69]Skip to the next game.
[31:29.47]It's only been 30- I feel like I've been here for two hours.
[31:31.42]It's been 30 minutes.
[31:37.21]no no this is lame no I get it get off me yeah that's my son I think
[32:06.79]Hmm.
[32:09.15]Hmm.
[32:09.53]Hmm.
[32:37.36]I can't do a dog.
[32:39.26]Hold on, yes I can.
[32:46.86]I can't do a dog.
[32:48.38]Hello?
[33:12.88]Actually, my phone just actually rang.
[33:20.40]She's calling me.
[33:21.20]Sorry.
[33:31.54]You had that ready for so- I swear to God, I- no.
[33:34.62]I just got a phone call.
[33:36.88]Right now.
[33:41.01]I did not have that ready.
[33:59.51]But you told me to freeze!
[34:15.34]Was it a dead bird?
[34:28.62]Okay, this is not CG.
[34:30.12]This is, instead of FMV Dad, this is CG Dad.
[34:34.66]Right this way?
[34:35.12]Hey, thanks.
[34:37.97]Yeah, you can close it.
[34:40.41]I'm nervous.
[34:44.11]I'm so nervous about this.
[34:45.75]I mean, we had our troubles, but it's worth a shot to see.
[35:10.60]Funny you'd show up.
[35:11.90]Well, got the flowers.
[35:17.91]Ew.
[35:20.55]Oh, I forgot you're allergic.
[35:24.93]Sorry.
[35:26.37]You want... Shut up.
[35:28.24]You just look handsome in the light here.
[35:30.76]Do I?
[35:31.04]Hmm.
[35:36.56]Maybe we could potentially work things out.
[35:41.66]Tonight, maybe.
[35:44.20]It's hard.
[35:58.13]You know, I... It's tough to come out here like this and try to
[36:05.20]You know what I'm saying?
[36:06.38]I know what you're saying.
[36:09.94]Hey, uh, hold on.
[36:14.30]Who are you?
[36:18.13]No, he's alright.
[36:18.63]He's cool.
[36:19.07]He's with me.
[36:19.45]I don't know who the fuck this guy is.
[36:22.03]Does he think he's going to walk in here?
[36:25.21]Hey, uh, sorry.
[36:27.57]Dude, what the fuck are you doing?
[36:35.44]You know I'm trying to fucking fix this here.
[36:37.22]Get that fucking out of here.
[36:38.30]You brought a dead bird?
[36:40.34]What are you... Bring a dead bird over to me and my ex.
[36:47.97]Fucking idiot.
[36:49.25]Don't... Look.
[36:51.61]I know we play the pretend detective game together and we try to find the criminals, but this is not the time or the place, dude.
[37:04.27]Just...
[37:05.87]Go home.
[37:06.23]Call mom.
[37:08.55]Okay, uh, we're back here.
[37:10.19]He just, uh, he got lost.
[37:11.19]This guy, I don't really know him.
[37:12.21]He got lost.
[37:13.23]But, um, anyways, so, uh, dinner tomorrow night, potentially, if you, if you, you could have me.
[37:19.01]Hey.
[37:21.83]What the?
[37:23.01]Why did you just do that?
[37:24.57]Oh.
[37:25.79]God fucking.
[37:28.36]No, no, you can't get, ugh.
[37:32.17]So, uh, I get how my... My little brother's gonna come with us, and... Um... God.
[37:41.46]Heh.
[37:43.70]This ain't fucking awkward at all, is it?
[37:47.68]Your little brother sucks.
[37:49.64]I know.
[37:51.74]Just be easy on him.
[37:53.40]He's kind of a weirdo.
[37:54.82]He brought a... There's a...
[37:58.37]There's a dead bird in the car, just it might stink a little bit.
[38:02.04]It probably smells like a dead animal, but just he's a little weird.
[38:04.74]Just let him, let him be.
[38:17.64]He went from potential boyfriend to little brother.
[38:24.09]Mike is muted.
[38:28.31]So, um, can I see the bird?
[38:32.55]I love birds.
[38:35.96]Is it a sparrow?
[38:37.06]Or... Maybe a chickadee or something like that?
[38:42.34]You don't have to be shy.
[38:43.26]Shit.
[38:50.68]I was gonna say, it's a blue jay.
[39:05.84]Please voice the main character.
[39:08.92]Please stop playing this.
[39:10.56]I can't.
[39:11.80]I can't.
[39:13.34]I can't.
[39:13.88]Do you understand?
[39:14.58]Hey, let's try something here.
[39:25.17]I mean... I need to compose myself.
[39:34.87]Hold on.
[39:37.12]You know, I... I like to collect birds.
[39:49.20]This is not good.
[39:50.58]I know, I'm trying.
[39:54.22]You decide if you want to play this crap or not.
[40:11.25]Alright, the achievement I just got is called Stargazer Stormchaser.
[40:21.16]Everyone's just going on dates.
[40:22.96]It's alright, we're Club Normies.
[40:31.37]Welcome to Club Normies.
[40:41.96]Come on in.
[40:51.26]This is where- joke so good you made it twice.
[40:53.86]No, there's too many people here.
[40:55.18]I can't- I can't keep this up with a hundred people.
[40:58.94]Mmm, this wine's delicious.
[41:09.86]Oh, that's a good scotch.
[41:27.29]Important.
[41:27.63]This is really important.
[41:29.09]I don't fucking care.
[41:29.69]This is important.
[41:31.14]So you guys have to deal with this.
[41:33.60]I can't receive a phone call right now.
[41:35.35]This is too important.
[42:02.82]Okay, here we go.
[42:09.22]This song goes out to my, one of my closest friends in the audience right now.
[42:18.04]I dedicate it to them because they mean so much to me.
[43:11.34]Nice.
[44:36.90]Oh no!
[44:37.92]It's time!
[44:39.24]Hyah!
[44:41.30]Ooh!
[44:41.92]Ow!
[44:42.06]No, no, I'm not supposed to... Oh, shit!
[44:51.67]Pull the fire off, quick!
[44:53.39]Get like a...
[45:04.47]Oh, I saw... Oh, shit, a chair!
[45:06.22]Uh-oh.
[45:12.60]No, wait, hey, hey, hey.
[45:13.80]Oh, it's electric.
[45:16.72]That guy sneezed.
[45:19.98]No!
[45:21.08]Get out of there!
[45:24.63]If you want to see her again, then you'll be in trouble.
[45:28.53]Ah!
[45:35.82]Come here!
[46:01.43]Now there really is no sound.
[46:02.53]Did I break it?
[46:14.08]Make punching noises.
[46:15.34]I need more sounds to do that.
[46:36.26]Is this guy gonna go down?
[46:50.92]So, so long ago.
[47:02.47]Remember the bird, kid?
[47:08.03]Long I've waited for this moment.
[47:11.73]Hmm.
[47:19.59]Maybe we'll see what you have.
[47:27.65]Boss fight.
[47:28.98]Boss fight!
[47:37.16]This is the lamest fucking boss fight I've ever seen.
[47:52.18]This guy sucks.
[47:59.37]No, no, no!
[48:00.03]Don't let him do it!
[48:07.44]I'm just absolutely rat-a-tat-tatting this guy's head.
[48:11.54]He's still going.
[48:25.72]Can't match my strength.
[48:27.62]You didn't even say that.
[48:29.20]Somebody dubbing over it did.
[48:34.94]No!
[48:36.84]My sniper rod!
[48:42.36]No, don't!
[48:43.52]That was my plan.
[48:44.36]Huh.
[49:07.98]Mom... Get... Out... Of the... Get me that car!
[49:28.51]Somebody call the police on that car!
[49:33.01]Somebody call the police!
[49:34.68]It's so unnecessary.
[49:35.72]You just did that for the cameras that are obviously there.
[49:38.74]What's this?
[49:42.56]Oh.
[49:43.10]More fighting.
[49:46.86]Gas station.
[49:47.42]We're fighting in front of the gas station right now.
[49:55.48]That dodge.
[49:59.22]I feel like that's how I would dodge in a fight.
[50:11.68]Nice.
[50:12.54]Broke his concentration.
[50:15.46]That was a pretty good combo.
[50:19.86]Over the car.
[50:32.73]Okay.
[50:36.84]I think...
[50:38.72]Like, people probably work hard on this, there's probably a lot of talented people with talented coders and stuff, but if I'm the executive producer at Square Enix, and you showed me that last, this last hole, maybe five minutes, ten minutes here, I'd probably be like, okay, yeah, that's, uh, okay, and I would turn around and I would do the bite my finger thing, like, oh, fuck,
[51:13.36]Did I lose?
[51:13.84]That's a great thumbnail.
[51:30.88]That's a really good thumbnail.
[51:33.70]I told you I was a baby.
[51:34.74]Everybody talked shit.
[51:36.12]What do you mean, baby?
[51:37.11]Question marks, baby?
[51:38.65]I'm the baby there and she's looking at me going, oh, look, there's my little baby.
[51:51.51]Come on.
[51:57.71]Why is the camera shaking so much?
[51:59.95]I mean, like, the actual full-motion video scenes look like a lot went into them.
[52:09.25]How old am I?
[52:11.07]This character?
[52:12.61]Um... Well, if I was a baby, then, I don't know, seven or eight years have gone by.
[52:18.37]I'm probably nine.
[52:30.96]Nice.
[52:43.07]How would I have caught up with this car?
[52:46.99]That is like an extraordinary amount of non-damage.
[52:50.35]You get out of that car.
[52:53.69]For a second I thought that guy was not going to notice I did that.
[52:58.52]Oh, come on.
[52:59.20]No, I wanna run behind the car.
[53:03.67]The guy was just doing laundry or something.
[53:05.47]What the fuck?
[53:09.03]We have to see this through.
[53:12.27]You understand?
[53:14.31]The game is apparently over in like an hour.
[53:17.40]I'm gonna see this whole thing through.
[53:25.24]You don't.
[53:25.68]You really don't.
[53:26.40]But don't you wanna know what happened?
[53:31.03]I need to know what happens.
[53:31.95]That's a pretty good strategy.
[53:45.95]Until I get fucking murdered.
[53:57.29]See?
[53:57.83]I'm very clearly lying on my back.
[54:00.48]As if baby.
[54:02.79]Just wait until you see the diaper go into frame.
[54:06.19]She's gonna hold up like a big poopy diaper and be like, oh!
[54:30.80]I'm just gonna spam.
[54:31.80]Who cares about actual inputs here?
[54:39.07]That was... the hardest punch I've ever seen.
[54:43.01]Why is the sound muffled?
[54:44.37]It's part of the game.
[54:45.47]It's part of the experience.
[54:47.41]I just lost again.
[54:49.79]I lost again.
[54:50.39]This guy punched me twice and I died.
[54:51.59]Alright, come on!
[54:58.37]Oh, yeah, that's moving.
[55:04.20]Never mind.
[55:15.22]Just wait till it fucking happens, man.
[55:17.12]You guys will say whatever you want to say now.
[55:22.37]Alright, I'm not gonna fucking lose again.
[55:26.83]The game is on hard.
[55:29.31]Just remember that.
[55:30.99]It's on hard.
[55:33.36]Why do I have this on hard?
[55:34.88]I'm already dead.
[55:42.22]I think that guy's character... I think that guy's broken.
[55:50.07]That's the only guy that... Why am I waiting for this?
[55:59.66]Why am I waiting for the diaper?
[56:01.20]It's not gonna happen.
[56:02.48]It's not going to happen.
[56:04.65]Alright, who cares?
[56:05.81]Put it on like the baby mode.
[56:21.90]The targeting doesn't make any sense either.
[56:23.54]It just randomly goes at a certain, I can't like target anybody.
[56:31.91]Like the guy behind me, like I can't, what am I supposed to do?
[56:34.53]Just press B?
[56:35.27]I mean, you really feel like Batman.
[56:51.63]Ah, he's gonna try to sneak up on me.
[56:55.47]There we go, there we go, there we go, there we go.
[57:02.93]I thought he was going to disappear.
[57:04.55]Yeah, come on.
[57:05.27]Of course.
[57:05.85]Wild.
[57:10.75]See, that took a lot of planning.
[57:13.00]That was... What?
[57:18.54]Alright.
[57:22.92]Okay, Tyler Durden.
[57:38.26]What?
[57:39.80]No, don't!
[57:40.40]Hold on, don't do it yet.
[57:43.42]Uh-oh.
[57:47.52]Here's the other group.
[57:56.90]Why do they become wild birds that just fly away?
[57:59.54]I don't understand.
[58:02.00]Was this like the next tier up?
[58:05.78]Oh, it's my friends.
[58:11.85]They said, refund the game.
[58:16.97]Should I keep playing?
[58:18.29]No, no, man.
[58:19.08]I mean, really what you should do is just, this is the point of the story where we're giving you a chance to refund.
[58:23.66]So, if you want to, just go ahead and you can hit escape.
[58:26.96]No, no way, man.
[58:29.42]Hold on, though.
[58:29.92]Hold on.
[58:30.86]Remember, after two hours, it's not gonna... I don't wanna...
[58:35.81]I am gonna keep playing this game until I finish it.
[58:40.49]You understand?
[58:42.37]Dude, alright.
[58:43.21]Well, that was your last opportunity.
[58:46.47]Fuck it.
[58:47.61]Who cares?
[58:49.10]I'm going for the end.
[58:52.92]See you later.
[58:58.10]Ow!
[58:59.60]How'd you break that?
[59:00.40]That was my fucking car!
[59:03.64]That's actually what he probably said.
[59:07.41]What's up next?
[59:15.23]Dump it.
[59:27.80]He bought it.
[59:30.38]The game is three hours long.
[59:31.66]Well, we're 33% of the way through it.
[59:43.80]Stop, please.
[59:53.17]Two more hours.
[59:55.19]Hold on.
[59:55.75]Somebody confirm that for me.
[59:57.53]Is this game over?
[59:59.23]Okay.
[60:03.10]That was interesting.
[60:07.80]It's four hours.
[60:10.84]Alright.
[60:11.12]Well, how about this?
[60:13.47]After it gets to the point where I can't refund the game anymore, I'll stop.
[60:24.56]I mean, it's either this or we're going back to Hitman.
[60:28.30]Average is 2 hours and 40 minutes.
[60:29.92]I'll get it done.
[60:35.01]Hitman.
[60:35.69]It's either this or Hitman.
[60:37.07]Because I want to play a couple of the other missions.
[60:41.65]I think I'm almost... I think it's over.
[60:43.60]I went by so... I did it so quickly.
[60:49.52]Please God, play this over Hitman.
[60:52.16]I don't know why part of me thinks this is funny.
[61:11.57]One guy said that.
[61:12.60]Yeah.
[61:14.24]Yeah, so?
[61:14.94]What's the point?
[61:19.33]Nobody said that.
[61:19.87]Yes, they did.
[61:20.97]Go look at the chat.
[61:47.21]Is this a lava keyboard?
[61:53.40]Don't you know there's probably like two more piano scenes?
[62:02.58]Break the keyboard.
[62:05.39]No, that lava keyboard was already grinded up in a meat grinder somewhere.
[62:16.75]Whatever they do.
[62:17.33]I've recycled it.
[62:33.62]Low viewers.
[62:35.26]Low donation.
[62:36.42]Bad stream.
[62:37.58]Not funny.
[62:38.52]Still watching.
[62:41.02]Hey, hold on.
[62:43.18]Listen.
[62:47.83]That's alright.
[62:48.69]That's that's alright.
[62:50.01]That's fine Look I'm gonna put I'm gonna beat this game Come on it's not alright.
[63:06.50]It's not fine.
[63:07.39]Oh
[63:10.79]Everyone has a bad stream now and again.
[63:12.65]This is not a bad stream.
[63:14.43]I'm having a great time.
[63:16.56]I'm having fun.
[63:18.72]I'm having a good time.
[63:21.32]I wonder how many times I have to say that to myself before it becomes true.
[63:29.74]Okay, I am getting a little tired of just like the enemies in the room.
[63:36.37]Alright, alright, it's about to stop.
[63:37.77]I'm about to turn it off.
[63:39.82]Alright, hold on, I'm about to turn it off.
[63:41.90]I'm about to turn it off, okay?
[63:51.10]I'm not gonna refund it.
[64:02.03]It's like I can't I'm wedged inside of a giant vise right now and on one side of the one of the wedges are people saying continue to play and the other wedge are people screaming at me to play something else I'm gonna get crushed.
[64:17.00]I'm gonna get squished Every ten minutes it gets closer like My hands are up and the two wedges are coming in.
[64:29.22]I'm like, oh shit.
[64:30.24]This is getting serious.
[64:31.26]Oh

[65:21.03]Make him into a puree.
[65:24.97]Alright, we're going to do a poll, okay?
[65:27.31]We will let democracy reign.
[65:29.17]I'm going to do a poll.
[65:31.99]And we're going to see what you guys want me to do.
[65:36.08]Okay?
[65:39.80]By the way, that poll was in 45 minutes.
[65:54.77]Got a little closer.
[66:12.75]Crush it.
[66:20.70]Doing a poll later will reduce the range of votes.
[66:41.23]I was getting a PN already, but I don't think we need it.
[66:47.87]You guys didn't think it was mom.
[66:49.43]Look!
[66:59.68]Terrible, terrible, terrible.
[67:12.98]We're about to get to the story climax.
[67:14.76]Come on.
[67:16.42]Here's the big reveal.
[67:19.80]I hear you with my blood.
[67:21.04]Here we go.
[67:21.56]Big, like, story reveal.
[67:23.55]Who's the skeleton?
[67:37.06]Why can I not hurt you?
[67:39.60]What's going on?
[67:41.92]What?
[67:49.70]This is just... I feel like I'm... Are you shooting me with a fucking gun?
[67:55.92]What the fuck was that?
[67:56.94]I just got taunt killed.
[68:12.87]I really, I honestly, ahhh, he's getting close.
[68:16.43]He's getting close.
[68:17.97]He's getting close to running away.
[68:29.67]Ah, damn it.
[68:34.47]I need to know who this is under there.
[68:36.45]I'm invested in the hour and 45 minute story.
[68:43.27]Alright, I just kicked the shit out of you.
[68:50.93]You gotta do some combos.
[68:57.45]It's gonna be the bomb, it has to be, right?
[69:01.01]And then I'll delete the game.
[69:03.21]Well... Alright, here's the scenario.
[69:09.84]If it's mom under there, I delete the game and refund it.
[69:12.92]If it's me under there, if I take the mask off and it's my face and it's been me the whole time, then I play for another four hours.
[69:20.10]Okay?
[69:25.18]And I've just been beating myself up in my bedroom.
[69:27.72]Here we go.
[69:33.76]Alright, remove the mask.
[69:42.15]Take off that mask.
[69:44.75]Here it comes.
[69:48.27]Here comes the Scooby Doo reveal.
[69:59.78]How did we transition from here to... Where did the bird go?
[70:05.34]What?
[70:08.90]Where did the bird go?
[70:14.87]Delete game.
[70:15.51]No, that wasn't one of the options.
[70:30.70]Please delete game.
[70:31.64]No, I'm going to write an entire review.
[70:37.60]I'm going to get hired by IGN.
[70:42.46]I'm going to write a review of this game because I need to complete it.
[70:47.34]And then I'm going to put my two weeks notice in.
[70:56.93]Did it?
[71:12.72]Okay, so now...
[71:22.15]This isn't Wirehead.
[71:23.73]I thought it was gonna be a game like that.
[71:25.61]From the trailer, it looked like it was gonna be... ...a FMV kind of game.
[71:33.83]I was misled by the trailer!
[71:40.48]Next time I die, I have to make a poll.
[71:43.94]Okay.
[71:44.86]That's fair.
[71:48.70]Why did you choose this game?
[71:55.08]I don't know, because we've had fun with FMV games before.
[71:57.84]I thought this could have been another one.
[72:03.47]But it's just walk from room to room and fight... enemy, and then... and then also paused.
[72:10.41]Is this the same room I was in before?
[72:12.27]Did the game reset?
[72:16.22]I'm confused here.
[72:16.94]This is the same room I was in.
[72:20.22]Wait, the game didn't reset, did it?
[72:25.54]Did I lose my save file?
[72:28.55]It's the same room, same TV.
[72:37.84]Didn't the same thing happen?
[73:06.47]The police are here now.
[73:08.05]Everybody freeze.
[73:11.85]We heard there was a disturbance.
[73:19.83]I've been able to open all these doors.
[73:25.01]This is a disturbance.
[73:26.29]This is the police.
[73:29.35]Put your hands up.
[73:30.39]Put a pole and chat.
[73:41.86]Here's what I don't get about this.
[73:42.86]I understand the whole, well, there's no sound because the main character is hearing impaired, right?
[73:47.92]But he's not here right now.
[73:50.20]He's not currently here.
[73:54.56]I mean, he's over here.
[73:55.42]Why couldn't we just hear that?
[74:06.53]Ah, the old two people holding a guy pretending to struggle bit.
[74:12.65]And they're just barely putting their hands on him.
[74:17.17]Yeah, get in there.
[74:17.73]Oh, this is so tough.
[74:18.97]He's wild.
[74:20.91]Oh, alright.
[74:28.19]Oh, I got a wild one here, too.
[74:31.51]Oh, that was hard.
[74:41.46]If I'm a director...
[74:43.48]I'm gonna be like, I'm gonna go, like, I'm gonna take, you know, the actors to the side.
[74:47.04]I'm gonna be like, hey, listen.
[74:48.58]Like, you, like, you can fucking bite that guy.
[74:52.56]For real.
[74:53.58]And, like, try to fucking bite him.
[74:55.20]And you want, like, really, you want, I would be, I would, I would direct my actors.
[75:20.35]I don't understand what... This is like the main selling point of the game is we just didn't add an audio track.
[75:34.05]That's the only thing.
[75:35.19]That's it.
[75:50.26]And you want to play it.
[75:51.34]I don't want to play it.
[75:54.32]But we see things through on this channel.
[75:57.78]Maybe like 30 or 40% of the time.
[76:00.56]We see things through on this channel maybe like 3 out of 10 times.
[76:05.56]Sorry, I just kind of had to piss back here.
[76:17.29]Sorry I startled you.
[76:22.15]You'll finish this but not L.A.
[76:23.61]D'amore.
[76:24.23]L.A.
[76:24.35]D'amore is like 60 hours.
[76:26.94]This is three.
[76:34.16]This is punishment for the dab.
[76:35.48]What the hell?
[76:46.02]I can't tell.
[76:46.48]Is this CG?
[76:51.04]No, this is real, right?
[76:52.57]Yeah, okay, this is real.
[76:59.39]Alright, we're almost ready for the pull.
[77:01.43]If he breaks the lamp, I'll give him a pull.
[77:03.93]Throw the lamp across the room and you get a pull.
[77:13.29]One of these tropes is gonna happen.
[77:14.53]He's gonna notice something ridiculous.
[77:16.69]Turn around, grab, throw.
[77:19.15]Shatter against the wall, then you get your pull.
[77:24.35]Wait, what did I say if it was me?
[77:26.97]If it was me doing this that I had to finish it, right?
[77:35.64]Oh, no.
[77:49.99]I did it, so I have to finish it.
[77:55.45]Ah! Aaaahh!
[78:49.04]He screams again.
[78:57.42]I'm remembering everything that happened.
[79:03.72]I broke that guy's arm.
[79:06.30]I smashed a bottle.
[79:09.12]I got yelled at.
[79:10.08]I made direct awkward eye contact with another actor on set and punched him.
[79:18.85]What have I done?
[79:25.92]What the hell are you doing?!
[79:28.00]He's the bird!
[79:34.97]He's the bird!
[79:35.99]I have to beat the game!
[79:40.99]He's the bird!
[79:42.75]I knew it.
[79:43.27]Yep, he's the bird.
[79:44.31]Okay.
[79:44.86]Well, no poll.
[79:49.02]Oh, it's over guys.
[79:53.09]Alright, no, okay.
[79:53.99]Alright, here.
[79:54.47]Let me, like... Let me go back and, like... Rewrite this rule.
[80:01.71]That was just a dream.
[80:02.49]That might not be real.
[80:03.21]Alright, if it was just a dream... Then...
[80:21.62]Rules are rules.
[80:26.44]See, it's okay.
[80:27.42]It was just a dream.
[80:29.18]That wasn't actually real.
[80:30.28]Just because it was on camera doesn't mean it was real.
[80:33.66]Still get your pull.
[80:46.17]Dream rules don't count.
[80:47.45]Yeah, that's real.
[80:48.63]That's true.
[80:54.04]No, that's fine.
[80:56.32]Just because it showed up in the game doesn't mean it actually happened.
[81:03.83]Face on.
[81:04.43]What do you mean, face on?
[81:12.92]Did he throw that out the window?
[81:13.70]Those are expensive.
[81:15.34]All of his personal data's on there.
[81:16.68]Fuck!
[81:35.31]He's punching the driver's seat.
[81:37.83]Yeah, he's gonna fuck up his driver.
[81:56.90]How long has it been?
[82:00.08]Have I been streaming for like five hours?
[82:02.16]No, not even two hours.
[82:03.34]Not even an hour and a half.
[82:07.08]I feel like I've been sitting in this chair for a month.
[82:16.77]The game actually has no sound.
[82:18.05]Oh yeah, that's not my configuration being wrong.
[82:27.90]You have 40 minutes left to refund this.
[82:33.46]No, I want to be one of their only sales.
[82:45.78]What's the story again?
[82:47.36]Uh, good luck, I have no idea.
[82:49.04]Something about a guy, his mom was killed when he was younger and it might have just been him that did it.
[82:56.69]And now he's... I don't know, I have no idea what's happening because we weren't able to see.
[83:05.23]I can't, there's no subtitles and you can't hear anything.
[83:07.47]So we're just supposed to be led to believe his dad is a cop?
[83:12.10]His dad may have killed the mother, and I have a friend that got the sneakers stolen by this guy, and then this guy went to jail, and then... And then this guy, I don't know.
[83:44.32]Why would you want to be one of the idiots that bought this and didn't refund it?
[83:49.71]I don't know, part of me thinks that's funny.
[83:52.75]I kind of think that's funny.
[83:57.17]Is it?
[83:58.11]It might be.
[84:00.00]I could look at my Steam library and be like, oh yeah, I remember that.
[84:08.92]This isn't $30, it's $15.
[84:19.57]He's running away.
[84:20.43]Okay.
[84:27.32]It's not worth it.
[84:29.14]Well, I gotta... I have up until... Why would you want to remember that you played this?
[84:40.25]For the Steam trading cards.
[84:41.47]Yeah, you'll see in like five years...
[84:46.06]This will be worth, like, at least one or two Hearthstone packs.
[84:51.58]You know what I mean?
[84:55.70]Uh, trading the Quiet Man two main character cards for, uh, two Refined Metal.
[85:03.48]You know, that's gonna be worth a lot of fucking money.
[85:09.64]The Quiet Man was critically panned.
[85:13.38]What?
[85:13.76]What are you guys doing?
[85:16.74]With the complaints... Uh-oh.
[85:24.90]Uh-oh.
[85:34.37]They're copy-pasting a review of the game.
[85:38.73]This game is 39 gigs.
[85:41.27]Holy shit, it was.
[85:42.27]I was wondering why it took so long to download.
[85:45.60]Why?
[85:45.92]Why is this game 40 gigs?
[85:47.12]What?
[85:47.36]Is it because of all the... The cutscenes?
[85:54.65]No way.
[85:55.43]Yeah, it did take a long time to download.
[85:56.81]That's true.
[86:00.35]It has uncompressed audio.
[86:03.43]Come on.
[86:03.71]H.264, man.
[86:04.05]You ever like...
[86:14.77]I know this is, I'm speaking in a total armchair here, like armchair dev.
[86:19.33]Like, you know, if the VI had... But sometimes I really do think, if I had like $10 million or like $5 million, I think I could probably actually put a team together and make something pretty good.
[86:29.32]Maybe that's just me being an idiot and like lying.
[86:31.72]I don't know.
[86:33.12]Do you ever feel that way?
[86:42.55]Everyone thinks that.
[86:43.71]Yeah, I know.
[86:44.27]But like... Sometimes I think it's real.
[86:48.77]But it's not.
[86:49.27]Because that's speaking from total ignorance.
[86:51.80]If I had five million dollars, I'd make a fun game.
[86:54.32]It's like, would you?
[86:55.04]No, I'd come up with... This is what I would make.
[86:56.90]That.
[86:57.30]But at least I would put that in the game.
[86:59.32]And I'd be proud of the spinning roundhouse kick.
[87:06.75]But then you have to bring yourself back to reality and be like, I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing.
[87:11.73]And there's no way it would be even remotely close to probably as good as this game, technically.
[87:17.12]It would be like a stick figure game.
[87:18.48]But I would hire people.
[87:19.64]I'd bring in very talented people.
[87:23.34]And I would just sit in a giant chair that oversaw the whole development team.
[87:28.62]And I'd have a big horn, like a big bullhorn.
[87:32.60]And I'd be like, you're doing a good job down there.
[87:36.51]You over at programming.
[87:37.79]Excellent work!
[87:51.38]Like, I would look over, I would see on the other side, there'd be, you know, the grass.
[87:55.16]The grass people, the grass team.
[87:57.66]Yeah, I'd have a dedicated team to grass.
[88:01.01]You know, I'd like to get tackled.
[88:04.77]Did I lose?
[88:05.31]No, I'm still alive.
[88:09.66]Like, the grass looks good over there.
[88:11.82]Good work.
[88:12.58]Maybe 2% longer blades.
[88:17.36]And people would love me as their boss.
[88:18.82]Yeah, I would be so- I would be such a good boss.
[88:26.09]I would throw parties.
[88:27.51]Like, I would invite clowns to be at birthday parties and
[88:31.72]I would always have like fresh muffins and cookies for everybody.
[88:39.58]Oh, I died.
[88:40.44]Shit.
[88:47.92]And anytime there was something I didn't like that was happening in the studio, like if I looked over at the team of grass blade designers and I was like, oh, that didn't look that good.
[88:57.50]I'd be like, you're doing your best and I appreciate it.
[89:01.43]Take the next three days off.
[89:04.65]And then I would just like get down off my giant chair and I'd sit at the computer and try to do it.
[89:12.51]Alright, here's a fucking poll.
[89:23.60]Next three days off is fire.
[89:25.08]No, it's not.
[89:25.66]That's go take a break and come back fresh.
[89:30.10]I would have fresh sandwiches every day.
[89:32.88]I would go person to person.
[89:35.41]Like seat to seat.
[89:36.53]And I would take a, hey, what's your favorite sandwich?
[89:40.31]No, actually, I really like a tomato basil mozzarella.
[89:43.85]Is that like weird?
[89:44.71]No, no, no, that's fine.
[89:45.69]You're going to have it every day.
[89:50.19]Okay, hold on.
[89:56.31]Finish this game Come back fresh or don't come back at all.
[90:04.41]That's not what I said That's not what I said Alright, here's your poll I died take a look there you go.
[90:22.97]Oh
[90:32.62]Come back so you can design grass.
[90:37.43]Yeah.
[90:37.91]There would be 2,000 people on the dev team.
[90:43.53]And by this point, I would have had, I would have already been making, you know, I mean, my Twitch career is, I mean, doing real good.
[90:49.48]So I'm saying probably another year or two, I'll have like six or $700 million in the bank account.
[90:53.18]So I would just, I would have 2000 employees each.
[90:57.45]There would be 10 employees dedicated to grass, 10 employees dedicated to the sky, 10 employees dedicated to food items that like modeling food items to put around.
[91:05.07]Nah.
[91:13.34]New game plus has sound.
[91:14.64]This is difficult.
[91:17.50]Look at this split here.
[91:27.73]Fucking sandwiches.
[91:30.03]Oh, the boss!
[91:31.01]Like, you don't have to scream at me though because I'm so high up in the... I'm in like a huge chair with a horn.
[91:36.23]Like, boss!
[91:38.02]Yeah, what is it?
[91:38.62]Tim, what is it?
[91:39.66]Tim, valued employee Tim, how are you?
[91:42.12]What can I get for you?
[91:43.88]Hey, uh, it's, uh... Can I have a lasagna?
[91:48.96]Absolutely!
[91:49.96]And I would fucking call, like, the nearest lasagna company, and I would get it catered for him.
[91:53.96]Uh, it looks like, okay, whoa, this is still close.
[92:17.13]bankrupt in a week and if somebody had a problem with like me or the company I'd I would get off the chair and I'd be like alright uh uh Mike Davidson I yeah I know you've had you have a problem with something here I it's I want you you you get a day in the big chair then he gets to go up there and like sit up there and like yell down about lasagnas to people and shit
[92:50.78]For 10 minutes.
[92:51.98]No, no, no.
[92:53.22]10 minutes.
[92:53.44]And then when he comes down, we would like high five.
[92:57.12]And then like, I would shake his hand and there'd be like $400.
[93:00.00]Like just four hundreds just in that handshake.
[93:07.30]Alright.
[93:07.62]I'm going to close this in like 60 seconds.
[93:15.74]Because this is so, this is too close, but I'm going to close it because it has to happen.
[93:30.35]This is the longest 60 seconds of my life.
[93:36.70]And the people that are making the grass, let's bring this last point up before I close the poll.
[93:42.02]You know, Mr. Elbertson.
[93:46.04]Yes, yes.
[93:47.60]I don't, I don't, I'm trying to get a feel for, I never like made grass before.
[93:51.89]I came from a different team, and I'd be like, hold on a minute.
[93:56.13]I'd come down, and we would eat grass together.
[93:59.48]I'd be like, do you want to try some?
[94:00.52]And we would eat it.
[94:01.56]I would eat it, mostly.
[94:03.48]I love it.
[94:04.46]So I would eat the grass in front of them, and I would explain exactly how it tasted.
[94:09.31]And I would be like, if you want to try, go for it.
[94:10.89]And I'd give them microscopes.
[94:13.17]Every single desk would have a microscope, by the way.
[94:16.15]So in case there was something you needed more detail on, look through the microscope for the blade of grass.
[94:21.50]If you wanted to eat it, it'd be fine.
[94:29.08]Alright, the poll is closed.
[94:30.40]I'm done.
[94:31.04]I'm out.
[94:31.88]Poll is closed.
[94:32.57]That's it.
[94:34.37]Nah, it's over.
[94:40.12]Oh, by the way, guys.
[94:40.82]This is a telltale game.
[94:45.91]Choices don't matter!
[94:46.99]I can't believe this got voted off.
[95:01.80]I can't believe it.
[95:11.94]What the hell?
[95:13.06]Everyone that said yes.
[95:15.61]Keep playing.
[95:16.47]Fuck chat.
[95:17.23]No, I can't do that.
[95:19.55]No, just one more guy.
[95:20.63]One more enemy.
[95:23.03]Look, I told you I was going to stop.
[95:24.01]I didn't tell you when.
[95:25.47]In like a minute.
[95:33.67]Okay, can I play this like in the corner while we figure out what else we're going to do?
[95:48.75]I may not have done what you wanted here, but does anybody down here want a lasagna?
[95:52.69]Anybody want a lasagna?
[95:54.91]I'm willing to call, I'll get one.
[96:03.11]Me, me.
[96:04.33]What if everybody wants a lasagna?
[96:06.75]Well then I'm gonna get a big lasagna.
[96:08.39]I'll get a big kiddie pool.
[96:11.14]And they'll just make a giant lasagna in the kiddie pool.
[96:14.25]It'll be lasagna day.
[96:15.87]And I'll jump in it and roll around in it with swimmies on.
[96:18.43]Alright, I'm leaving.
[96:28.87]I'm gone.
[96:29.27]I'm leaving.
[96:29.91]I'm leaving.
[96:31.99]I'm almost gone.
[96:36.18]God damn it.
[96:40.20]Hold on, let me open up- I was gonna- I'm gonna play a couple of Hitman missions that we didn't do.
[96:54.24]And this is gonna take a second.
[97:11.23]I'm gonna break my computer.
[97:15.94]If I crash my computer, I'm gonna be so sad.
[97:17.86]Alright, here it comes.
[97:33.74]Let's get another game capture on here.
[97:37.53]What the fuck?
[97:38.41]The controller.
[97:39.27]I don't want Rumble.
[97:41.23]Nobody wants Rumble.
[97:43.93]Nobody.
[97:45.13]This was a gimmick back in like the Nintendo 64 era.
[97:51.16]Does anybody get immersed with Rumble at this point?
[97:55.76]The controller shakes.
[97:57.38]That was cool.
[97:58.88]Back in 2002.
[98:06.16]I mean, I like it.
[98:06.76]It's fun.
[98:07.42]Sometimes.
[98:07.80]Don't you wish food had a rumble feature so when you ate lasagna it would, like, rumble to go on down? ...
[98:38.64]This is impossible, so I'm just gonna delete.
