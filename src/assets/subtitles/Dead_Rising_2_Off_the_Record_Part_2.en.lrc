[00:02.57]Does anybody think I lost my mind?
[00:06.66]I don't know, there's a load of questions, but I'll explain.
[00:11.06]So, is it weird that I've made a coffee, like I've got a coffee, and I drank half of it, and I said, damn it, I really wish I had more coffee.
[00:26.22]So, I have a water here.
[00:28.91]And I said, you know, I could just turn that water into coffee like Jesus.
[00:34.72]I cut and I just poured it in to the coffee that's here and just made another coffee.
[00:40.42]It's just a coffee here now.
[00:42.34]So when I get to 50% again, I'm going to add more and fill it up again.
[00:47.93]It's going to be infinite coffee.
[00:58.62]Let me see how it tastes.
[01:00.54]Pretty good.
[01:01.88]That's the third time I've done it.
[01:04.08]So you can drink... Like, I love coffee.
[01:08.20]But I could just make a coffee and just dilute the fuck out of it.
[01:12.53]Over and over again.
[01:13.37]And it's like I drank eight coffees, but I only drank one.
[01:17.85]This is actually a really good idea.
[01:21.97]And then it would just become... Dunkin' Donuts!
[01:26.65]That's all the time I got here, folks.
[01:28.03]I'll see you next week.
[01:38.02]We're going to keep going with Dead Rising 2.
[01:40.46]If you didn't know.
[01:47.13]Off the record.
[01:49.69]I'm having a lot of fun with it.
[01:51.47]We are at just about the halfway point.
[01:55.17]so gonna see what happens gonna see if we can do it all in one stream we'll see I think we can do it hey failing kidneys thanks for the five community subs appreciate that so we'll we'll take a little assessment of where we are at like the six to seven hour period right
[02:19.13]Maybe I'll just power through it.
[02:21.40]I've eaten.
[02:22.84]I came prepared.
[02:23.48]I ate a full salad with this delicious Gorgonzola, uh, Gorgonzola dressing.
[02:33.22]Oh boy, was it tasty.
[02:41.51]Oh, he ate a salad.
[02:42.71]Do I want an award?
[02:45.53]No, I'm just saying, like, I ate a shitload of greens, so I'm gonna be full for a while.
[02:51.83]I ate 1,900 calories worth of greens.
[02:54.23]I'm done till tomorrow, right?
[02:55.73]The You Mad Diet.
[02:57.78]I'm actually... I'm liking the You Mad Diet.
[03:00.86]I get to eat once and eat, like, 1,900 calories worth of kale?
[03:13.28]You're just eating grass.
[03:15.28]Not true.
[03:15.76]Alright, let's get out of this.
[03:16.60]Let's move over to the game.
[03:19.74]It's not called UMAD.
[03:21.58]Yes, it is.
[03:28.62]It's... Yes, it's OMAD.
[03:31.76]I changed my opinion.
[03:34.38]UMAD.
[03:36.77]Chat's mad.
[03:37.87]Alright, let's go.
[03:42.29]It's just paused.
[03:43.55]Time doesn't go when it's paused, right?
[03:46.13]Shouldn't.
[03:48.53]All right.
[03:49.23]Let's refresh the memories here.
[03:53.18]It does not.
[03:55.04]This is what I look like.
[03:59.78]This is what I sound like.
[04:04.45]Cool.
[04:04.77]Alright, so we have 4-2.
[04:05.85]Run for the money.
[04:06.87]I have one Zombrix.
[04:09.02]Slave to Fashion.
[04:09.90]This is right here, so let's get it done.
[04:12.44]Locate the woman in distress at the Fortune City Hotel.
[04:17.28]We got time for... How many cases are in 4-2, just so we don't mess it all up?
[04:25.37]Okay, 4-2.
[04:27.11]I got a long time to do 4-2.
[04:30.68]Once we do case five, though, I gotta get on that, because I don't want to burn time.
[04:42.25]Let's move.
[04:44.67]It's saved.
[04:45.23]I got my drink.
[04:48.71]Can I give this to him?
[04:51.79]No, not gonna get saved.
[04:52.87]Time management today.
[04:54.00]It's not gonna be like last night.
[04:57.34]I meditated right before this stream started.
[05:03.11]So, I'm going to be way better than I was yesterday.
[05:09.27]Why am I seeing a million Kappas?
[05:13.37]Is that a meditation joke?
[05:17.31]Whoop!
[05:18.31]Those men?
[05:19.07]Okay.
[05:19.35]He ate greens and he... Frank is lying on... Okay.
[05:37.85]How many... This is a lot of shit going on here.
[05:40.03]How many cases are here?
[05:43.59]Look at all these scoops.
[05:45.23]There's too many.
[05:49.80]This is right in my level range.
[05:52.42]It's yellow.
[05:54.88]You know, I feel like these are going to turn blue.
[05:56.84]And I don't really want to do them.
[06:05.67]Come on.
[06:06.45]Come on, I'm waiting for it.
[06:07.77]Give it to me.
[06:09.57]Nothing?
[06:11.35]I'm surprised.
[06:13.89]Holy shit, some of you... Wow.
[06:16.55]I was waiting for like a wave of hatred.
[06:20.16]Not really that much.
[06:22.46]That's really interesting, actually.
[06:23.66]I'm gonna have to write that one down.
[06:27.14]Like, that reaction.
[06:28.94]That was a World of Warcraft reference, and that's always a guaranteed, like, Jerma, shut the fuck up, minus two.
[06:35.92]That's interesting.
[06:39.40]Bargaining.
[06:39.94]Yeah, I know what magazines do.
[06:48.58]Uh, I should have picked this up.
[06:51.22]Beforehand.
[06:52.46]Hey, hey, hey, get away.
[06:53.47]I'm looking at stuff.
[06:55.31]Um, just leave this thing here.
[06:56.33]I don't need it right now.
[07:00.39]Just put it down.
[07:01.85]No, don't put the... Don't put the rake down.
[07:06.24]Alright.
[07:06.92]My meditation, like, fucked me all up.
[07:08.90]I'm, like, still meditating right now.
[07:10.84]No.
[07:11.70]That's why meditation doesn't work when you play Dead Rising.
[07:14.76]I've got to be, like, lit up like a Christmas tree, you know what I mean?
[07:19.12]I can't be slow and calm.
[07:21.18]I have to be, like, freaking out.
[07:24.47]Wait.
[07:31.61]Can you not break an ATM with a rake?
[07:35.50]Local man tries to break ATM with a rake.
[07:39.50]Why can I not get into these?
[07:43.96]Can you?
[07:44.36]I don't know, probably?
[07:51.94]I got lots of money.
[07:53.00]I want that car though.
[07:59.70]No!
[07:59.80]That's the longest I've ever gone without getting bit.
[08:01.26]Alright, slave to fashion.
[08:05.93]What do I have for weapons?
[08:07.13]They're terrible.
[08:07.65]I have a shitty rake.
[08:09.87]Just get rid of it.
[08:12.05]I need gems.
[08:12.83]Wait, gems, gems, gems, gems.
[08:14.41]Where's the jewelry store?
[08:19.03]Where's our jewelry store?
[08:24.30]Charms?
[08:27.04]Here we go.
[08:27.58]Right across the way.
[08:29.12]To the right, straight.
[08:31.86]Get off of me!
[08:36.63]Where is it?
[08:39.19]Charms?
[08:39.61]Right here.
[08:45.46]Alright, so now I'm gonna combine this with the head.
[08:49.22]I'm gonna grab, like, two or three of these.
[08:51.02]I feel like these are, like, a great ingredient.
[08:55.98]Just, like, stock.
[08:56.64]Can I do gems in, like, most shit?
[09:04.25]What is this hat?
[09:05.29]Uh, I don't know.
[09:07.81]It was available, so I picked it up.
[09:10.63]Okay, so gems and the alien head.
[09:12.85]Maintenance room is right across the way, right?
[09:15.49]Yeah, there's one right there.
[09:24.77]Excuse me.
[09:29.15]Can you start streaming?
[09:30.81]What the hell are you talking about?
[09:32.85]Alright, gems, and then alien head.
[09:45.48]Right off the face cam.
[09:48.50]Let's see.
[09:50.92]Laser eyes?
[09:54.84]What the fuck?
[10:00.52]Okay, I don't want to use this.
[10:01.62]Is it... I gotta make sure I have that on during cutscenes, because that's, like, really funny.
[10:10.24]Alright, machete and power drill.
[10:13.60]Power drill and gems.
[10:15.89]Gems and machete.
[10:19.17]Power drill and gems.
[10:21.61]Gems and flashlight.
[10:22.69]Right, right.
[10:23.79]Alright, I'm gonna get a flashlight.
[10:25.29]I want, like, two lightsabers.
[10:29.52]Where can I get a flashlight?
[10:36.12]Use the broom?
[10:36.70]Yeah.
[10:40.52]I wanna hold on.
[10:41.17]It's gonna be such a pain in the ass to keep these gems, though.
[10:48.49]Alright, give me that broom.
[10:56.92]There we go.
[10:58.56]The drill sucks, but it's a panic weapon.
[11:04.78]Alright, I think I'm alright.
[11:05.92]I got some decent stuff.
[11:09.86]Drill in the bucket.
[11:12.06]Yeah, isn't that a one-time use, though?
[11:17.24]I'll try it.
[11:26.73]Lots of PP.
[11:27.75]Oh, that's good to know.
[11:29.89]Alright, here we go.
[11:31.01]Drill and bucket.
[11:32.19]I'll just use it on this guy.
[11:33.09]Can I pick it up again?
[11:38.77]Oh, holy shit.
[11:39.49]That's actually a lot of PP.
[11:40.73]You're right.
[11:41.07]Alright, this is just a PP farming.
[11:45.73]Put it on a boss?
[11:48.17]Does that actually work on a boss?
[11:56.05]No.
[11:56.49]Oh.
[11:56.79]Oh well.
[11:57.43]Well, then we'll just use it on random people.
[11:58.65]Let's just use it on, like, I don't know, this guy.
[12:00.61]This person over here.
[12:07.76]Get off me.
[12:11.74]What are you doing?
[12:12.24]What are you doing?
[12:13.72]Alright, give it to me.
[12:22.25]Let's go.
[12:23.05]No!
[12:23.43]Okay.
[12:24.45]Slay to fashion.
[12:25.01]I gotta do this now.
[12:33.49]That is a lot of fucking points.
[12:38.09]Is this part of your time management skill?
[12:41.98]Uh, yes.
[12:42.66]Alright, slave to fashion.
[12:50.30]Let's go.
[12:52.74]Do the wilted flower?
[12:54.54]Should I?
[12:54.78]I think I'll have time.
[12:56.84]How far away are they from each other?
[13:00.45]I got time to do it.
[13:01.59]I'm gonna do this one first.
[13:05.90]I'm gonna save it right in the middle, just in case this is a nightmare scenario where I can't.
[13:18.15]Why do I hear machine guns?
[13:22.04]Who has a machine gun here?
[13:33.01]Was this pre-recorded stream Tuesday?
[13:34.61]Yes.
[13:35.67]Welcome, everybody, to pre-recorded Tuesday.
[13:38.85]Where, you know, every stream, I stay up after last night's stream for seven hours, and I stream to myself for until eight o'clock this morning, and then I render it and upload it to Twitch, and let it play as a rerun.
[13:57.87]That's what I do.
[14:02.29]I'm going to keep this one here, because this is the complete, total rewind save zone.
[14:11.73]Quick Accusing.
[14:14.13]Alright, that's saved.
[14:18.44]Now... This thing lasts a really long fucking time.
[14:25.38]I can't believe I can still use it.
[14:30.97]This is not good time management.
[14:32.37]I know.
[14:32.83]I know.
[14:33.09]Alright, one more time.
[14:39.33]I can do it again.
[14:40.07]Okay, it's done.
[14:44.19]It's done.
[14:44.57]It's done.
[14:44.85]Okay, we're gonna keep it.
[14:56.34]Because I don't want to stand still and get hurt.
[15:00.76]Who's firing a machine gun?
[15:05.34]These guys are in the game now?
[15:09.60]Why is the visceral cleanup detail guy going fucking crazy?
[15:20.47]Now I need healing.
[15:21.17]Watch out.
[15:33.29]Okay, I need health.
[15:35.65]There's some stuff over here.
[15:39.99]Chat rewound too many times?
[15:44.41]What do you mean they rewound too many times?
[15:47.51]French fries, nice.
[15:48.99]All right, I'm good.
[15:51.05]Wait, coffee creamer is a, take coffee creamer.
[15:54.53]And get rid of the french fries for the other coffee creamer.
[15:58.09]No, the french fries, that's... Okay, I'm good.
[16:00.53]Somebody's yelling to me.
[16:01.49]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[16:06.06]Eat shit!
[16:07.84]Uh, this is unbelievable.
[16:08.74]I'm not gonna use that.
[16:10.00]Holy fuck, this thing's incredible.
[16:14.46]What?
[16:17.19]Hello?
[16:17.35]Are you... Are you alright?
[16:20.77]Are you alright?
[16:22.68]Oh my god, don't look at me.
[16:25.88]Sorry, I'm trying to help.
[16:27.48]Oh my god, this is totally embarrassing.
[16:28.76]This is like a total tragedy, okay?
[16:33.56]I'll have to turn around and talk to you.
[16:37.54]What happened?
[16:39.51]Like I was in my hotel room, I went to get some ice and that stupid door locked behind me.
[16:42.71]I came down and this place was totally... A zombie outbreak started, but come with me, I can get you to safety.
[16:49.19]Are you drunk?
[16:50.59]I can't go out here like this.
[16:58.70]Give her your onesie.
[17:00.00]What?
[17:00.38]How do I take off my clothes?
[17:03.36]A men's store at the other side of the mall?
[17:05.68]Oh, God!
[17:27.35]There's a men's store by the statue at the other end of the mall.
[17:31.91]Oh, you gotta be shitting me.
[17:38.80]Uh... Maybe I... I'm gonna just... Can I make it back here?
[17:43.14]Time management.
[17:43.68]Let's go.
[18:08.77]Almost there.
[18:19.35]He's so fast, I know.
[18:21.43]Okay, it's right over here.
[18:24.65]There's the statue.
[18:36.43]Okay.
[18:37.25]I'm in.
[18:38.70]Uh, underwear.
[18:40.40]Looking for men's underwear.
[18:48.84]Let's go.
[18:50.38]Alright, where's my wheelchair?
[18:57.33]What is it?
[18:59.51]Too hot?
[18:59.99]I don't understand.
[19:05.39]And she's gonna get in the wheelchair.
[19:17.56]And we should be good to go.
[19:22.62]No, I don't want you in this thing.
[19:23.70]Get out.
[19:25.36]Get out, get out, get out.
[19:26.62]No.
[19:29.04]Stop.
[19:36.41]Don't forget to take a picture.
[19:40.27]How do you do a selfie?
[19:41.46]I can't seem to get it to work.
[19:48.72]There's a magazine right there.
[19:54.07]You need to be unarmed for the selfie.
[20:00.87]Okay, so wait.
[20:03.02]Unarmed.
[20:06.61]And it's right bumper and right trigger.
[20:09.51]It's not working.
[20:12.99]That's... That's spit.
[20:19.79]No, how do I... I don't have time for this.
[20:24.01]Let's go.
[20:24.33]It has to be next to a zombie.
[20:32.45]Okay, let's go.
[20:36.76]Slave to fashion.
[20:37.54]Good.
[20:41.53]Alright, get in the chair.
[20:46.33]In the chair.
[20:47.99]Get in the chair.
[20:48.51]What do you mean, no?
[20:52.85]The floor is cold.
[20:53.67]Carry me.
[20:54.37]No!
[20:55.41]God damn it.
[20:56.27]I don't have any weapons besides the laser.
[21:04.69]Hold on.
[21:08.50]Alright.
[21:10.92]Let's go.
[21:12.78]Okay.
[21:14.20]Alright, we're gonna do Wilted Flower now.
[21:20.22]Do I have time for that?
[21:24.83]Do I have time to deliver her and then do Wilted Flower?
[21:34.11]Don't think so.
[21:34.73]We have to go right for it.
[21:35.57]I'm gonna save it right here.
[21:38.76]Let me see.
[21:39.20]Yeah, I got to bang a left, save it, and then we'll see.
[21:41.28]Alright, out.
[21:47.34]No, no, no, no, no.
[21:47.96]Up.
[21:48.40]I want to bring the wheelchair so I can go quickly.
[21:57.94]Stop banging directions?
[22:02.40]Okay.
[22:08.69]Dammit, I'm supposed to save the fucking- I'll handle this!
[22:18.62]Okay.
[22:20.50]There's people shooting machine guns at us.
[22:24.44]Just go, just run.
[22:28.91]I got french fries for her, don't worry.
[22:30.61]Car!
[22:31.21]Car!
[22:31.93]Get in the car.
[22:33.47]Flashlight!
[22:46.95]So you're gonna eat the french fries and then we'll save the game.
[22:53.48]Why?
[22:55.56]What the fuck was that?
[22:58.30]Why did the car accelerate to a million miles per hour?
[23:03.05]That's fucking crazy.
[23:05.01]Okay, just a quick save point.
[23:07.83]French fries, eat them.
[23:12.67]Just a quick, I gotta do something real quick.
[23:23.42]Lightsaber.
[23:24.26]Done.
[23:24.82]Board.
[23:25.78]I'm just going to take two boards.
[23:27.74]Board and knife.
[23:30.82]Right?
[23:33.28]No, just take the knife.
[23:34.08]Take the board.
[23:34.50]Let's go.
[23:47.63]Ball of yarn and knife.
[23:48.93]Okay, so this is the safe one.
[23:52.68]Let's do number one.
[23:55.80]Give her a weapon.
[24:00.76]Here, take a board.
[24:06.06]I can't give her a weapon.
[24:07.04]I can just carry her.
[24:10.48]Just get in the car.
[24:13.69]She just took damage.
[24:14.47]Unbelievable.
[24:15.93]Alright, let's go do Wilted Flower.
[24:34.78]Wait.
[24:44.38]And go!
[24:51.85]Just move.
[24:52.55]Just run.
[24:56.63]I got a coffee creamer.
[24:57.49]Oh my god!
[25:04.13]Oh my god.
[25:05.19]That was fucking funny.
[25:06.83]Alright, don't look.
[25:08.13]Just go.
[25:11.71]But first.
[25:15.22]In here.
[25:16.84]Take one of these.
[25:19.60]Full heal.
[25:20.14]Close the door.
[25:22.34]That guy just got fucking destroyed.
[25:24.00]That was insane.
[25:26.68]That's the best thing I've ever done in a video game.
[25:30.96]Take this too.
[25:32.94]Okay, give me the gun.
[25:37.42]Okay, I don't need a 2x4.
[25:39.44]And what else we got?
[25:41.44]Ketchup?
[25:41.88]Beer.
[25:43.21]I'm gonna drink this.
[25:48.85]Okay, can you take a gun?
[25:50.71]No.
[25:51.63]Follow me.
[25:53.76]I'm gonna bring a cocktail, too, just in case I need it.
[25:56.98]Okay, let's go.
[26:07.46]I don't want to waste this too much.
[26:09.66]Gun.
[26:16.98]Money.
[26:19.54]Money.
[26:19.98]Gun.
[26:21.40]This is just one of those streams where I just say verbs and like nouns.
[26:25.72]Go.
[26:26.56]Gun.
[26:28.20]Money.
[26:30.81]Casino.
[26:31.21]Go.
[26:31.93]Run.
[26:32.83]Gun.
[26:37.62]This is every stream.
[26:38.70]No, it's not.
[26:41.26]It's not.
[26:43.24]Gun!
[26:43.60]Money!
[26:47.85]Money!
[26:52.55]This is kind of far away.
[26:53.81]Is there a save point?
[26:56.95]There is over here.
[26:58.89]I'm gonna go up for this.
[27:00.51]We don't have time for the save point.
[27:02.07]No, we don't.
[27:14.46]Europa.
[27:17.18]Right outside the door.
[27:18.22]Are you serious?
[27:19.28]Anger.
[27:20.92]Anger.
[27:21.32]Gun.
[27:22.73]Mad.
[27:23.03]Are you fucking kidding me?
[27:29.79]Alright, I got a lightsaber for... What am I even looking for here?
[27:35.52]Wait, there's food in here?

[28:16.37]And I'm gonna take one of these.
[28:20.05]I'm gonna... Where's my lightsaber?
[28:22.63]What happened to the lightsaber?
[28:28.67]No, I don't want a fucking pineapple.
[28:31.57]Oh, headshot.
[28:39.40]It's just T-post.
[28:41.22]I'm trying to pick up the lightsaber on the ground.
[28:47.33]Oh my fucking god.
[28:48.39]Alright, let's go!
[28:53.10]Alright, here we are.
[29:07.12]You're in?

[29:15.18]What?
[29:19.13]Look at the woman in distress.
[29:25.71]Why is the... Why does the GPS have me do... Why did the GPS make me go down the stairs?
[29:33.88]It's the spa.
[29:35.74]Here we go.
[29:42.57]I'm in.
[29:49.24]That just scared the shit out of me.
[29:52.17]Was somebody in the tanning bed?
[29:54.53]Oh, alright, here we are.
[29:57.19]Can I help?
[29:58.89]Please, please help me.
[29:59.55]I was stuck in the tanning bed.
[30:00.51]The staff ran away or something.
[30:02.28]I'm so parched, I can barely move.
[30:03.76]Do I need to give you orange juice?
[30:06.54]You're baked, literally.
[30:09.64]I was lying on my front for way too long.
[30:12.78]This can't be good for my tan lines.
[30:15.83]You didn't know how the zombie outbreak happened?
[30:17.65]Listen, I can take you somewhere safe.
[30:19.99]Don't be awkward, I just noticed the service here was bad.

[32:51.17]Alright, I gotta start forward too here in a minute.

[34:16.32]The shortcut is through the changing room in the back, and it'll take us to the Royal Flush Plaza safe house just right next door.
[34:29.71]Oh, shit.
[34:31.65]Alright, save it.
[34:35.89]Put it down.
[34:42.31]So I can... Finally, I get a shortcut.

[34:46.42]Okay, 430.
[34:47.70]We're gonna do... This is the complete oh shit moment.
[34:50.46]Safe.
[34:51.72]Let me drink some more of this coffee and then dilute it again.
[35:00.62]Let's go.
[35:00.82]Alright, I'm gonna start 4-2 so I don't run into a problem.
[35:06.33]I have to take a picture of both of the girls.
[35:10.55]Whatever.
[35:10.85]Alright, and then we're right... Oh, we're right there.
[35:13.29]Nice.
[35:14.09]What do you mean?
[35:20.54]You have plenty of time.
[35:22.86]Don't get me started on this one today.
[35:30.49]Why is it telling me to go there?
[35:32.69]What's with the arrow?
[35:33.57]What's his arrow pointing at me?
[35:37.08]Oh, it's all the way up there.
[35:39.20]Oh, no.
[35:48.86]What's going on?
[35:50.74]What's happening?
[35:54.65]You okay?
[35:56.91]Um...
[36:01.15]Everybody, um... It just came out of nowhere.
[36:09.71]It just appeared in front of her.
[36:20.23]And he wonders why he's softlocking.
[36:23.44]No, I don't wonder.
[36:24.44]I... Look, I'm gonna get, like, 100,000 points.
[36:32.84]Thank you.
[36:33.18]Thanks for sharing the embarrassment with me.
[36:36.67]Have a bit of my shopping money.
[36:37.91]Whoa, wait a minute.
[36:39.51]What do you mean shopping money?
[36:40.85]$20,000 is shopping money.
[36:46.60]That's a lot of money to just go shopping with.
[36:51.06]Got the combo card for this one.
[36:52.84]Good.
[36:53.64]All right, let me save it real quick.
[36:58.41]Only 18,000.
[37:05.84]200... 2 million bits.
[37:15.68]Such a gentleman.
[37:16.30]He didn't take a picture of them.
[37:17.32]I mean, I did, but... I was very, very... I'm... Look, I ain't gonna take, like, a picture, like, of them.
[37:25.59]Everybody wants me to get the erotic points.
[37:29.31]But I'm not gonna do it.
[37:30.85]I'm only gonna take pictures of my own ass and my own, like, penis.
[37:36.96]And then those photos, uh, gonna get, like, leaked.
[37:40.44]And, alright, no, I gotta go, I have to go, I have to go, I have to go.
[37:42.40]Alright, let's move.
[37:46.03]I have plenty of, uh, shit to have, okay.
[37:54.49]Alright.
[37:56.17]I don't have time to get these two, you can't save them all.
[38:00.98]Everyone knows Slappy.
[38:03.02]Locate the mascot.
[38:07.17]Where's this one?
[38:08.35]No, locate.
[38:08.87]There's a mascot?
[38:11.44]Look, I just have to complete 4 or 2.
[38:13.82]And then the new case starts.
[38:19.92]No, I'm gonna stick with it.
[38:21.68]I'm gonna stick with it.
[38:30.43]Take this shortcut.
[38:32.05]Yeah, so the shortcut is...
[38:36.76]Where's that?
[38:37.30]I have to burn that into my brain.
[38:38.86]The shortcut is over here, right?
[38:41.64]What is this thing?
[38:45.46]No, which one is it?
[38:48.24]It was like this way.
[38:50.20]Where is it?
[38:52.50]No, I forget where it is.
[38:54.76]It's a bathroom next to the safe room.
[38:57.04]It's this one, right?
[39:01.54]So it's in here or is it in here?
[39:05.38]Okay.
[39:05.90]I need to burn this into my brain.
[39:07.72]I need to see where it takes me.
[39:12.87]But for now.
[39:18.01]I need to see.
[39:18.47]I got the game saved.
[39:20.08]It's okay.
[39:20.28]Okay.
[39:32.03]These bottom two missions are psychopaths, so, well.
[39:36.07]I'm not sure I have time to do them.
[39:46.28]Because 4-2, I don't want to softlock myself out of not doing 4-2.
[39:49.08]I want to see where this ends up, though.
[39:54.29]Where is it?
[39:55.13]Other side?
[39:55.73]Other one?
[39:56.33]Is it like a vent on the other side?
[40:03.88]I don't think so.
[40:09.12]That's the toilet there.
[40:12.64]So now where am I from here?
[40:14.47]I need to burn this into my brain.
[40:17.47]So now I am on the second floor above Palisades.
[40:27.49]I mean, shit, it is like right there.
[40:33.55]Let me see if it's possible, right?
[40:35.13]Like, you gotta, we have to at least see if it's possible.
[40:36.84]I got the game saved.
[40:37.64]The Royal Flush Plaza.
[40:49.44]I have a Zombrex still.
[40:50.40]I also have enough money to buy another Zombrex.
[40:54.75]What was in there?
[40:55.23]I don't, whatever, I don't know.
[41:00.81]7pm, time to, no, it's not.
[41:06.81]Slappy's right next to me.
[41:11.80]There's so many things to do.
[41:13.36]There's too many things to do.
[41:16.38]Investigate the chef.
[41:18.34]Or locate the mascot.
[41:21.17]There's a lot of shit to do.
[41:22.55]Fuck.
[41:30.60]Ah, that's so... This is far away.
[41:35.44]I'm already on the way.
[41:36.68]Slappy has time.
[41:38.98]We can find him later.
[41:40.50]Just don't let me forget that.
[41:54.55]Slappy's, Slappy's literally right here!
[41:57.19]He's right here!
[41:58.95]Is that Slappy?
[41:59.85]That's Slappy right here!
[42:01.12]Awww!
[42:17.82]You.
[42:19.46]You're Frank West.
[42:22.16]It's one of the Soda... The Soda Pop P Brothers.
[42:25.62]You know me.
[42:27.26]I'm Slappy.
[42:28.44]Everyone knows Slappy.
[42:31.61]And everyone knows you.
[42:34.99]You're good at stuff.
[42:37.53]I saw it on TV.
[42:40.33]Listen, kid.
[42:41.01]You can't believe everything you see on TV.
[42:43.77]But I really, really need you...
[42:52.27]We asked for chicken, but it was in my direct line of sight.
[42:56.10]I have a lightsaber though.
[43:16.80]But what is it?
[43:18.68]Does it need batteries?
[43:20.93]Just do a full swing below the knee.
[43:23.23]Take both the legs so he can't run around.
[43:44.90]Then pick up body, throw over the balcony.
[43:47.66]Into the zombies.
[44:04.73]That's pretty good.
[44:05.53]Alright, he's on skates.
[44:07.87]Let's do a dodge.
[44:08.73]Go!
[44:31.81]What?
[44:35.51]Oh shit.
[44:37.01]Oh shit.
[44:37.91]Oh shit.
[44:38.37]Oh shit.
[44:38.71]Oh shit.
[44:39.01]Oh shit.
[44:39.29]Oh shit.
[44:39.55]Oh shit.
[44:39.85]Okay, hold on.
[44:40.29]What if can I... Oh, we can play this game, man.
[44:48.46]I'm gonna be baby alien.
[45:06.26]Let's go, motherfucker!
[45:09.26]It's recess!
[45:20.03]I feel like this is just what happens.
[45:21.81]This is what's inside the minds of toddlers when they're just like plent- It's empty.
[45:50.87]Okay.
[45:51.41]Time for... Here we go.
[46:07.95]I gotta go in... Oh, okay.
[46:08.87]Right when he stops.
[46:25.37]Stop!
[46:27.09]Why is he not stopping?
[46:29.24]Oh, you prick!
[46:34.16]Dude, I can't hit him!
[46:43.69]What?! !
[46:57.34]Alright, so I can't... you can't swing at him.
[47:01.87]Where's the checkpoint?
[47:02.81]Is it right there?
[47:03.33]There he is.
[47:09.54]Alright.
[47:09.82]Alright.
[47:29.55]Watch out!
[47:33.54]Forestry's quick!
[47:37.98]Oh, come on.
[47:40.72]Jedi Fallen Order looks really good.
[47:56.30]Oh, fuck you, Slappy.
[48:05.10]Out!
[48:05.44]Out!
[48:08.00]Alright, now I'm gonna do lasers.
[48:36.56]Susie.
[48:45.48]Oh, Susie.
[48:49.08]Now Slappy is broken too.
[48:55.83]We'll be in the big toy box in the sky together until we get fit.
[49:11.31]Pepe hands.
[49:17.22]We're again.
[49:18.76]We'll live forever.
[49:31.48]It would be really funny if he took off the mask and he looked just like that under the mask too.
[49:35.80]Flamethrower, water gun, and gasoline canister.
[49:38.77]That's pretty awesome.
[49:40.73]Okay, hold on.
[49:41.33]Oh, I can just take yours.
[49:44.49]Alright, do I not have time for this?
[49:47.13]Gotta get a good photo.
[49:47.93]Okay, um, now I've gotta go this way.
[50:00.36]The chicken one.
[50:13.23]I'm gonna get softlocked if I don't do it.
[50:26.38]We're out.
[50:31.49]Wait!
[50:32.19]I need that kid's, like, jumpsuit onesie thing.
[50:34.43]I need it.
[50:46.01]And, um, is it like fun superhero boots?
[50:50.56]Yep.
[50:56.38]Okay, I'm ready.
[51:01.82]It's just Christopher Robin as an adult.
[51:04.20]But not Ewan McGregor.
[51:05.70]This is what it should have been like.
[51:15.09]How do you save the game?
[51:17.19]Right fucking now.
[51:20.62]Okay, so this is... Casino Vaults.
[51:24.10]There's a save point over here.
[51:36.48]drop this.
[51:36.90]I don't need it.
[51:39.22]I just want this one.
[51:40.00]Alright, where's that save point?
[51:50.56]It's right here.
[51:52.04]Hopefully I have enough time to do both of these.
[51:53.84]Can I even get in here?
[51:57.24]Shit, I don't know.
[51:59.21]ATM, don't.
[51:59.91]I can't.
[52:05.13]Jeremy, you're fucked.
[52:06.00]This story mission is so long.
[52:08.70]But, it's okay.
[52:09.46]We're going there now.
[52:11.30]I'm doing it right now.
[52:17.53]I can't even do this if it's, like, yellow?
[52:22.33]Can I get into this bathroom?
[52:31.14]Where's this fucking bathroom?
[52:33.66]But the bathroom's the elevator?
[52:35.62]The bathroom's in the elevator.
[52:38.18]Huh?
[52:49.37]Fuck.
[52:50.05]Alright, I can make it.
[53:07.66]Where even is this one?
[53:13.24]Is it this one here?
[53:13.96]Is that where I'm going?
[53:16.18]Yeah, there's a woman in the underground.
[53:23.88]It's... Wait, it's all of these locations.
[53:30.35]It's all of them.
[53:32.07]Oh no, that's not good.
[53:36.83]We may have to go back in time and do 4-2 when it's halfway done.
[53:41.25]Like, when I'm in one of my safe zones.
[53:43.33]Climb over it, dude.
[54:07.20]Just do the cases as soon as you can.
[54:08.80]Well, some of them you can.
[54:10.00]Alright, I have a checkpoint, which is right here.
[54:15.89]How the fuck am I gonna be able to do all this?
[54:19.43]All the casino vaults.
[54:20.55]All of them.
[54:22.37]Um, how am I gonna do that?
[54:24.85]I need the car.
[54:26.93]The car's, like, all the way over there.
[54:28.04]Wheelchair.
[54:34.30]Wheelchair.
[54:36.95]I'm just gonna have to redo it.
[54:40.27]We'll see how far I get.
[54:41.85]I've got some decent save points.
[54:45.96]Just reset now.
[54:46.68]There's no way I'm doing this.
[54:50.80]Hold on.
[55:05.04]Of course.
[55:06.00]You're laying down fire across everything, and I'm still gonna grab him.
[55:09.51]No, there's no way this is happening.
[55:46.70]Oh man, there's no way.
[55:47.89]I have to come here first.
[55:50.41]Look at all this shit.
[55:57.81]This is, this is like gonna take all day.
[56:12.70]Just kill me.
[56:13.54]Just kill me.
[56:13.98]I gotta come here prepared with like weapons and shit.
[56:19.70]I mean, it might be possible though.
[56:24.54]Don't give up yet.
[56:37.65]Did this motherfucker just eat a whole pie?
[56:39.43]Yes.
[56:41.23]I had to.
[56:41.65]Alright, they're over here.
[56:53.73]Shit, this is really low.
[57:00.66]I thought I had time.
[57:05.89]I thought I had time to do all this.
[57:19.70]Okay, well here they are.
[57:22.22]Where are you?
[57:22.82]They're just in here?
[57:34.27]Okay.
[57:41.15]Are you shitting me?
[57:43.97]Are you shitting me?
[57:47.82]I have to do this three separate places?
[58:00.97]Dude, what is it with zombie games?
[58:04.35]Forever.
[58:05.49]There always has to be assault rifle military people in these games.
[58:09.03]I just want to play the zombie game.
[58:10.35]It's almost like they second-guessed if the game was any fun.
[58:13.80]Fuck, we gotta add, like, segments where they shoot at people with guns.
[58:21.03]This happens in almost every zombie game.
[58:26.40]So, uh, this is tricky.
[58:28.98]Because... Mmm, the one 620?
[58:39.75]I think, maybe, it's gonna have to be the 620 one.
[58:42.77]This is, this is very far away.
[58:44.83]How much time is in this one?
[58:52.43]Let's take a look.
[58:58.14]I want... Oh, this still... It's... You two are here.
[59:03.74]Shit.
[59:07.12]God damn it.
[59:08.44]Really?
[59:08.82]And it's yellow.
[59:11.20]Alright, I have to... Dump these two and then go.
[59:17.35]So, I'm gonna... That's not that far away.
[59:20.45]I can... It's possible now.
[59:21.55]Here we go.
[59:26.39]There should be enough time.
[59:29.58]I'm going to have to abandon all the other missions.
[59:35.30]We just have to dump them and go?
[59:39.74]Unlock the shortcut.
[59:40.68]I didn't?
[59:42.42]Didn't I?
[59:45.83]Yeah, I did.
[59:46.77]This is after the shortcut.
[59:49.83]Yeah, I'm good.
[60:16.78]And then I'm gonna have to go to the furthest one away.
[60:18.74]Yep.
[60:20.68]And just try to not die.
[60:22.90]Fuck.
[60:27.39]And here's the 20 grand.
[60:30.33]And then I think that this is where I saved it.
[60:33.23]I should have gone to the first one.
[60:35.25]Because I remember I was like, oh, let me make sure I have a timeline back here.
[60:37.79]Yeah.
[60:38.61]So the other save point is... This one's 10 minutes faster.
[60:43.27]Because see, watch this.
[60:50.49]Ready?
[60:55.98]This one is the same exact timeline, but I was like five minutes faster.
[61:02.23]So we're gonna do this one.
[61:05.33]And remember, the absolute, like, fuck-face scenario, if this is impossible, I've got, take a look at this, I've got two.
[61:13.65]Two is four hours ago.
[61:17.71]Look at that.
[61:18.52]That's why you never save over that.
[61:20.30]Keep that there.
[61:20.92]That's why I did this.
[61:22.22]I saved three minutes.
[61:24.04]Go.
[61:24.12]Go.
[61:25.75]So I need to go to this one.
[61:27.63]This one here.
[61:33.84]No, alright.
[61:34.24]So I'm going to take the... Take the shortcut.
[61:38.18]And then go to this one.
[61:40.54]And then try to make it all the way back.
[61:44.42]I think that's correct.
[61:47.40]Let's try it.
[61:49.48]I have such shitty weapons though.
[61:51.01]I need to be able to kill two of them.
[61:57.80]Why not left, middle, right?
[62:00.62]Because I think that's shorter, I think, if I go to the shortcut first.
[62:06.23]Do the one right next to me?
[62:11.49]Yeah.
[62:12.55]And then go in the shortcut.
[62:13.79]Okay, so left, shortcut, middle, right.
[62:16.99]No, left, shortcut, right, middle.
[62:20.43]Left, right, middle.
[62:21.31]I don't know.
[62:21.89]I'm just going to go for it.
[62:30.99]So in that case, just do this one.
[62:36.57]Which is in here.
[62:38.86]Okay, let's go.
[62:41.00]Do I have enough time to do this shit?
[62:44.88]I really hope so.
[62:47.10]Otherwise, we have to rewind three hours.
[62:49.20]Here we go.
[63:02.13]Take your time.
[63:06.04]Take the time, take the time.
[63:10.42]I have to get an assault rifle quick.
[63:18.16]How many times do I have to shoot you before you die?
[63:19.85]I got too much body armor.
[63:28.11]Jesus, give me a break.
[63:55.14]I wanted to pick up the handbag!
[64:06.31]Kramer.
[64:06.53]I'm with the Kramer.
[64:09.91]What is that?
[64:10.59]A drill?
[64:11.75]How do I stop the drill?
[64:16.43]Okay, there's one.
[64:18.19]Okay, uh...
[64:20.50]It's a lot of money right here.
[64:24.52]Good job on that, Frank, but there's still $75,000.
[64:26.04]Alright, I need assault rifles.
[64:33.92]Drink this coffee.
[64:38.74]Drink this other one, too.
[64:44.55]27.
[64:44.57]Get rid of the handbag.
[64:47.89]Let's go.
[64:51.45]Good?
[64:51.99]Money?
[64:53.07]It's not that much.
[64:53.73]Okay, so now we're gonna go... Just straight up.
[64:59.37]Just straight up, or should I take the shortcut and go right?
[65:02.12]Help me!
[65:02.46]Hold on, let me refill my coffee.
[65:12.41]There's a second money case?
[65:16.83]Key and case, key and case, key and case, key and case, key and... Security, uh, key.
[65:20.81]Key and case.
[65:21.37]Another case?
[65:27.71]I didn't see it.
[65:28.41]I don't see it.
[65:29.03]I didn't see it.
[65:33.07]Give me the assault rifle.
[65:34.17]Where's that case?
[65:35.83]Where's that case?
[65:37.99]No, these are suitcases, guys.
[65:39.31]Stop baiting me.
[65:40.53]Oh, here it is.
[65:46.65]That's it?
[65:47.19]10 grand?
[65:47.55]That's all I came back for?
[65:48.49]Okay, cut.
[65:50.44]Go.
[65:54.86]Alright, did we decide?
[65:56.79]On what was the better idea?
[65:58.45]Just go straight through?
[66:13.61]He hates bits.
[66:14.49]What are you talking about?
[66:22.10]I have to save it though.
[66:25.64]Alright, did we decide?
[66:26.90]I can save it in there and take the shortcut and then come down.
[66:32.98]That's the play.
[66:33.32]That's the play.
[66:33.74]No.
[66:42.52]No.
[66:43.14]But I have to save the game.
[66:43.98]What if I get caught and die?
[66:47.79]What if I die?
[66:48.65]I might die.
[66:50.47]And then you're going to hear loud noises.
[66:55.15]I'm going to be like, I should have just saved it back there, and I should have done this, and I should have replaced the handbag with that orange juice.
[67:08.28]And I'm going to be like, I should have listened to my own intuition.
[67:12.80]I should have listened to myself.
[67:14.44]You've already heard it before.
[67:24.70]Somebody's in trouble.
[67:27.84]I don't have time for whatever.
[67:30.32]Who is it?
[67:31.08]I don't have time to do it.
[67:32.38]Where are they?
[67:32.76]Are they close?
[67:39.86]Follow the sound of my voice.
[67:48.28]Can you hear me?
[67:49.40]Can anybody hear me?
[67:51.28]Just making sure.
[67:52.26]Good luck.
[68:00.59]Meat melon.
[68:07.25]Oh, you're screwed.
[68:15.09]Like, fire the gun in the air?
[68:17.09]I'm not going to do it, because... Okay, this is where I have to start.
[68:27.37]What?
[68:27.77]Who shot me?
[68:33.82]Fire the gun in the air.
[68:34.54]Just make sure that they know that you have a weapon.
[68:40.70]Replace...
[68:43.29]Where is he?
[68:44.55]Where is he?
[68:48.21]Big slot machine.
[68:55.74]Big slot machine.
[68:57.58]Taking a lot of effort to not play that.
[69:08.25]I shot you a fucking million times, mate.
[69:12.35]Where did...
[69:28.24]Nice bouncy bullets.
[69:33.22]What's in there?
[69:33.62]Get that money.
[69:35.25]Alright.
[69:53.76]And more stuff.
[69:55.76]More thugs, okay.
[69:57.22]Um, what's in here?
[70:00.18]No time, there's no time, there's no time.
[70:01.38]Uh, handgun.
[70:04.08]What's this thing?
[70:05.56]Electric prod.
[70:06.98]Uh, pizza.
[70:08.12]Take the pizza.
[70:09.00]Is pizza full heal?
[70:10.95]Probably.
[70:12.33]Okay, magazine combat 3.
[70:14.11]10% boost to PP from weapon kills.
[70:18.91]Keep it.
[70:28.62]Almost done.
[70:30.48]Anything else I need to grab?
[70:31.88]Some people are gonna freak out if I leave something.
[70:34.92]Whatever.
[70:35.38]Too late.
[70:39.64]I gotta get this done.
[70:48.18]Okay, go, go, go.
[71:00.41]No, no, no, no.
[71:01.35]Put down the... Ah, whatever.
[71:07.10]Nice!
[71:37.17]Almost done.
[71:42.03]Who the hell is... Janice?
[71:44.95]Janice, uh... Hold on, let me go... Oh, no.
[71:50.35]Let me clear.
[71:51.01]Um... They put too many things in front of you.
[71:56.84]There's too many things.
[72:12.92]Is Jasper?
[72:16.43]Fuck.
[72:19.83]Hold on.
[72:22.45]Wait.
[72:24.69]Wait, wait, wait.
[72:27.28]How close am I?
[72:28.28]I'm far away.
[72:29.42]I'll be back.
[72:33.92]Does everybody stay alive?
[72:37.99]Who else needs help?
[72:39.43]There's too many people that need help.
[72:41.35]I'm overstimulated!
[72:53.97]Okay.
[73:04.49]I should have enough time to turn these all off.
[73:08.17]Jasper is dead.
[73:11.12]I thought you guys said I was gonna have time to come back and save them.
[73:17.68]That was not true.
[73:18.76]Alright, where is this other box?
[73:34.03]It's straight ahead.
[73:35.03]The GPS is freaking out.
[73:43.17]Did I just get bumped?
[73:47.28]What the fuck?
[73:49.50]Alright, there it is.
[73:51.18]Why are you even here?
[73:54.58]Wait, eat, eat, eat, eat.
[73:55.90]No, don't drink, don't eat.
[73:56.94]Just don't fucking slow down.
[73:58.80]Why does it have one bullet?
[74:23.77]No!
[74:25.65]No, drink.
[74:26.61]Drink the orange juice.
[74:35.08]God damn it!
[74:40.37]This is outrageous.
[74:48.93]How the fuck am I supposed to go over here?
[75:05.54]Shoot it!
[75:18.53]Where the fuck is this guy?
[75:20.81]Oh my god, give me a fucking break, Capcom.
[75:23.47]What is this?
[75:34.83]You gotta be fucking shitting me.
[75:51.73]I need to eat something.
[75:57.83]Is anybody left in here?
[76:09.24]Does TK's goons are still going?
[76:11.37]Oh, what the fuck are you talking about?
[76:17.15]What?
[76:20.23]What?
[76:20.43]Go ahead.
[76:28.92]Frank, those men have already drilled through the wall outside the Atlantica Casino.
[76:32.56]You have to stop.
[76:36.27]Stop picking up.
[76:37.47]I wanted to pick up the fucking... I need another gun.
[76:41.95]Wow.
[76:42.91]Give me a break, man.
[76:46.49]Forget doing the story, but you need like the whole day to do this shit.
[76:57.70]This whole mission takes like the whole bar.
[77:13.79]Is this the right?
[77:18.53]They're everywhere!
[77:19.23]I don't think I'm gonna do this.
[77:42.13]Oh.
[77:42.65]My.
[77:43.25]Fucking.
[77:43.97]God.
[77:49.35]Give me your gun.
[77:49.77]Give me your gun.
[77:50.89]Give me your gun.
[77:51.53]I don't have any food.
[77:53.23]There's a beer on the ground.
[78:09.95]There was so much food.
[78:10.79]I...
[78:12.86]I thought I was done.
[78:13.85]Oh, it's going to be really, really goddamn close.
[78:20.99]Oh, come on.
[78:28.36]Why is it military?
[78:29.28]It's case four.
[78:30.26]What's the military doing here?
[78:31.94]Go, go, go, go.
[78:36.68]Go, go, go, go, go.
[78:46.90]It's over.
[78:53.98]Forget about the zombies.
[78:56.08]That was fun for the first three cases.
[78:58.86]Watch out for the fucking guys in the yellow clothes.
[79:03.06]That just have assault rifles now.
[79:12.89]I'm dead.
[79:14.31]I'm dead.
[79:23.07]Where's this checkpoint?
[79:23.99]Is it close enough?
[79:24.67]I wonder if it's still possible.
[79:36.36]Maybe I can sneak around this military, dickheads?
[79:38.76]Or goons, whatever.
[79:40.48]Hey, goons!
[79:42.56]Watch out for the goons!
[79:50.41]Take the bike?
[79:51.51]That's not- That's not gonna do anything!
[79:53.97]That bike is fucking tiny!
[79:56.49]That bike is not- Hey!
[79:59.73]I would like some food!
[80:01.39]Do you have food in here?
[80:05.37]Food?
[80:07.13]You don't have- You don't sell food?
[80:09.15]Do you sell food?
[80:10.71]You don't sell food in here.
[80:16.48]I thought they had food in here.
[80:19.59]I'm so dead.
[80:20.13]This is like, I'm fucking locked.
[80:23.77]The motorbike?
[80:24.51]God dammit.
[80:30.06]Fuck me.
[80:36.36]I'll get it after this next attempt, which is gonna be over in about 12 seconds.
[80:52.59]You go to the pawn shop for lunch?
[80:55.16]I don't know, they might have something there.
[80:56.62]Move, move, move.
[81:06.18]Alright, where is it?
[81:08.34]Any food on the ground?
[81:10.26]Give me that bike.
[81:11.18]Give me this thing.
[81:12.46]Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me.
[81:13.60]Any food in here?
[81:14.74]He's covered wars, you know.
[81:16.19]Taping guns to a bike shouldn't be a problem.
[81:18.33]Bring a bike to the combo bay.
[81:20.64]Experiment with different... That's really cool.
[81:23.40]I can't wait to figure out what that means.
[81:26.54]I've got to go now.
[81:31.97]Where am I going?
[81:33.05]Straight ahead to the left.
[81:41.55]Okay, it's actually right here.
[81:44.64]Please get away from me.
[81:45.64]Please get away from me.
[81:47.16]Okay, I know where it is now.
[81:48.18]I'm going to fail.
[81:52.61]I'm gonna fail it, I'm gonna fail it's okay, but I know where it is.
[81:54.75]Give me the bike, give me the bike, give me the bike.
[82:19.91]Okay, I have to destroy this.
[82:21.33]Okay, I have to destroy that.
[82:22.51]Just destroy the van and I'm out.
[82:28.67]God damn it, man.
[82:31.21]Ugh, this is so... ugh.
[82:33.79]Let's just shoot the van.
[82:42.33]Do gun and bike?
[82:44.12]You mean like right here?
[82:51.81]How do I do it?
[83:04.06]How do I do it?
[83:07.78]A different gun.
[83:08.52]Instead of just being lied to.
[83:09.56]Great.
[83:25.65]No, no, God, give me the gun.
[83:30.68]How many bullets were there?
[83:38.18]I can't even take out the fucking van.
[83:46.04]Oh, come on.
[83:48.87]There's so many people over here.
[84:02.77]Okay, so, let me not waste time.
[84:05.49]Do I have enough time to eat anything?
[84:06.73]Like, let me, there probably is like a sandwich or something lying around somewhere.
[84:11.99]A beer, anything.
[84:13.67]Nothing at all.
[84:17.93]I'm driving into the restaurant.
[84:23.23]Are you kidding me?
[84:24.84]Give me this.
[84:37.97]What?
[84:38.71]I can't get in, it's locked.
[84:44.65]Okay.
[84:49.40]Give me a fucking break, man.
[84:53.58]So, uh, here's the strategy.
[84:54.92]Strategy is, um, I need to look for food.
[85:01.30]So, get bike, grab something to eat.
[85:04.48]I think I should have enough time to do this.
[85:07.25]So where's... There's a restaurant right here somewhere.
[85:10.92]Where's the restaurant?
[85:11.76]I mean, this thing is a restaurant.
[85:14.82]Here we are.
[85:15.20]Okay.
[85:16.34]I should have enough time to, like, get some health.
[85:21.29]I don't want to use any guns.
[85:22.33]Give me the lightsaber.
[85:26.06]Okay, let's heal.
[85:32.65]Of course it only heals one.
[85:35.47]Any pies back here?
[85:36.47]There's just beers everywhere.
[85:37.51]Just drink all the beers.
[85:38.94]Okay, well, I'm done.
[85:44.74]Oh, why did I drink three in a row?
[86:05.87]Okay.
[86:07.09]So, look at how many zombies there are and shit.
[86:09.91]Here's the plan.
[86:10.47]I'm gonna- I have to kill these guys.
[86:12.02]I can't just like- I'm just gonna run straight and shoot at the van!
[86:15.58]I have a gun.
[86:40.33]Why that?!
[86:54.72]Get away from me!
[86:55.32]Get away from me!
[86:55.88]Get away from me!
[86:56.50]Get away from me!
[86:57.88]Get away from me!
[87:05.72]Huh?
[87:11.67]Did I do it?
[87:12.03]Wait, did time run out?
[87:15.02]So time ran out.
[87:18.90]Yeah.
[87:21.46]Well, we got one of the endings.
[87:25.64]That's good.
[87:46.36]It's possible.
[87:49.65]Spent too much time in the restaurant.
[87:57.75]So, I have a question.
[87:59.81]Those of you that have played this game, like, 30 times in a row.
[88:03.37]And know everything.
[88:05.53]When I blow up this van, is that the end?
[88:14.27]Looking at fucking chat kill me just kill me kill me kill me Is this still a drill that I have to undo There are more trucks
[88:39.81]Oh, god damn it, man.
[88:41.29]So, I'm gonna have to go back.
[88:43.75]Just restart the whole game.
[88:45.61]I know that's what you're supposed to do.
[88:48.32]But, if it's possible, I want to try to do it in one go.
[88:51.58]Okay, right here.
[89:06.53]Get off the bike.
[89:17.15]Whatever.
[89:17.71]I... I... I... Fucking lord.
[89:23.94]Where are these guys shooting?
[89:24.98]What are you even doing out here?
[89:26.24]Why are they here?
[89:27.56]What are you doing here?
[89:28.80]I had the same amount of health that I started with.
[89:41.21]And I have no more guns.
[89:46.83]No, that's over.
[89:48.37]I have to add to that.
[89:50.55]I don't think I can go in the restaurant.
[89:59.63]There's nothing wrong with starting the whole game over?
[90:01.21]Yeah, but... I feel like I don't want to do the whole game again.
[90:05.57]You know what I mean?
[90:09.62]It's definitely possible.
[90:17.36]If I have to, oh, absolutely, yeah.
[90:21.30]Get three guns and shoot the van.
[90:23.86]Let's try this side.
[90:25.62]Yeah, but I need three guns.
[90:29.91]Okay, this is actually not a bad spot.
[90:40.23]Seriously, like, the glue that these zombies have in these games.
[90:45.29]Holy shit.
[90:46.83]Alright, let's see if I can do it.
[90:51.04]I gotta do... I gotta go to the same spot I was before.
[90:56.88]Down here.
[90:58.66]Wrap around.
[90:59.36]Otherwise it's gonna die.
[91:00.50]Okay, let's try it.
[91:08.36]I just need to get a gun.
[91:09.28]I need to...
[91:14.23]Seriously, give me a fucking break.
[91:28.24]Okay, just give me the gun.
[91:30.52]Give me a gun, give me a gun, give me a gun, give me a gun.
[91:46.22]Jesus Christ.
[91:58.15]Alright.
[92:00.19]I'm just gonna go in and swing in the truck with the lightsaber.
[92:05.91]Kill the peop- It's not that simple.
[92:09.08]It's not that simple.
[92:10.20]Just go in and kill them!
[92:12.56]Huh?
[92:29.61]It's possible to do it like this!
[92:32.83]If I had, okay, if I have full health, it's possible.
[92:37.09]It was that simple!
[92:39.40]I refuse to believe it was that simple.
[92:43.36]I refuse to believe it.
[92:45.36]Oh, I have to believe it.
[92:46.44]Give me a break.
[92:47.84]No, Jesus!
[92:48.94]Why is it that simple to drive the bike into the van and just spam X?
[92:57.01]Mod that guy.
[93:05.30]Why did you do that?
[93:32.78]Fuck it, I'm going in.
[93:52.31]I gotta kill people.
[93:53.17]I have to kill people.
[93:54.35]I have to kill them.
[93:55.75]I have to kill people.
[93:56.91]You have to kill them.
[93:58.21]They have to die.
[93:58.87]Okay, you gotta kill them.
[93:59.83]You gotta kill the guys.
[94:02.64]Hey, who's winning?
[94:04.68]Shoot the profane tank.
[94:06.36]Jesus Christ.
[94:10.65]No, don't unmod that guy.
[94:12.37]He didn't even get modded in the first place.
[94:14.59]I wish I could come in here with, like, have food right now.
[94:20.35]You can't hit the back of the truck.
[94:22.69]Somebody fucking rules.
[94:34.13]No, I thought that was a beer.
[94:35.17]What the fuck is a knife doing over here?
[94:38.53]I didn't... What?
[94:43.33]What just healed me to full health?
[94:44.57]Put it down!
[94:45.12]Did a snack just heal me to full health?
[94:53.72]It's one bar!
[94:55.18]Alright, here we go.
[94:56.94]I'm going for it.
[94:57.44]I'm gonna shoot propane tank, get it, and swing.
[94:59.61]Violently.
[95:26.03]Fire the gun!
[95:28.09]What is happening?
[95:38.18]Oh fuck.
[95:57.74]No, die!

[96:02.68]Please!
[96:03.62]Give me this!
[96:04.08]Give me this thing!
[96:04.98]This thing's heavier!
[96:06.09]This thing's way heavier!
[96:08.45]Explode!
[96:08.91]I did it!
[96:12.47]Now what?
[96:22.09]Damn it!
[96:23.62]What do I pay you people for?
[96:29.28]Staying a bit longer than planned, boys.
[96:33.85]Did I win?
[96:43.77]I'm going mad.
[96:46.08]I'm going mad.
[96:47.10]Not like angry mad.
[96:50.78]Like mad like the Hatter.
[96:55.03]Like the guy from Alice in Wonderland.
[96:56.41]I'm so happy that I have the dealer hat on, though.
[97:24.84]I can't fucking believe it.
[97:26.20]I thought I had so much time.
[97:28.52]And it happens in this next case.
[97:31.98]I am not going to let run into the ground.
[97:34.84]The next case will occur at 12 a.m.
[97:36.10]Okay.
[97:55.13]I know it happens every case, but there's so much interesting shit to see in this game that I get so stuck.
[98:01.35]Okay, this one.
[98:02.01]Which is the safe one?
[98:02.79]This one?
[98:12.78]Okay, 5-1.
[98:13.48]Let's go.
[98:13.92]Just get to 5-1.
[98:15.98]Wait a minute.
[98:16.58]I have no health.
[98:18.32]Alright, where do I go?
[98:19.46]Don't die.
[98:22.92]It starts.
[98:23.68]I have time.
[98:26.69]I actually do have time.
[98:27.91]Because it just starts... I just have to be in the right spot for this.
[98:35.22]I could probably do this one.
[98:36.66]Because it is... Yeah.
[98:42.65]A woman with a golf club is fending off zombies.
[98:44.35]She has good form.
[98:48.10]Let's see what I can do.
[98:50.06]I do want to go back to the bar, though.
[98:51.06]Where's the bike?
[98:52.43]And there are people shooting machine guns at me still.
[98:55.83]There are people that have guns still.
[98:57.13]This is just my life now.
[98:59.16]This is my life now for the rest of the game.
[99:26.57]Dermot, throw the trash can for food.
[99:30.19]Holy shit, there's food everywhere in here.
[99:34.61]What?
[99:34.89]Okay.
[99:36.26]You can eat food out of the... That's why you don't eat food out of the trash.
[99:49.11]Okay.
[99:51.37]I'm going this way.
[99:52.83]I need to get guns.
[99:58.05]Stop dropping that.
[100:02.53]Fuck it, let's go.
[100:07.95]You get in the mask.
[100:23.60]Well, I'm already sick, so I might as well just go all the way.
[100:27.75]Soda doesn't go bad.
[100:28.93]It's got like a shitload of chemicals in it.
[100:54.13]Uh, alright.
[100:54.82]What is this gonna make?
[100:56.72]Freezer bomb.
[100:58.52]Alright, you dickheads out here.
[101:01.72]I'm so done with you zombies and... No, I'm not even done with the zombies.
[101:05.02]I'm done with the machine gun guys.
[101:08.71]That guy just tripped on my throw up.
[101:11.61]That's just... Just use it now.
[101:23.87]Holy shit, that was way more ridiculous than I thought it was going to be.
[101:27.19]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[101:32.46]Just hug this wall.
[101:33.26]I don't have any guns.
[101:37.32]Okay.
[101:39.10]Food.
[101:45.33]Is it drink?
[101:46.15]No, it's a hamburger.
[101:47.09]Don't eat it.
[101:58.61]You left your lightsaber at the bar.
[102:11.04]Well, don't worry.
[102:12.16]So did Luke.
[102:20.03]Knife?
[102:27.54]He's right, actually.
[102:28.36]I know.
[102:29.42]Yes, I know.
[102:30.02]I don't... People just don't... Have you guys never seen Star Wars before?
[102:34.18]Alright.
[102:39.44]I've got the Wolverine hands.
[102:56.97]This is the best weapon in the game, really?
[102:58.46]I'm gonna save it, then.
[103:03.26]Alright.
[103:04.28]More importantly, let me get back to normal.
[103:10.16]Okay, there's some vodka.
[103:11.26]Let's just drink it.
[103:22.40]Dress shoes, okay.
[103:23.82]Here we go.
[103:25.58]Let me look decent again.
[103:29.56]Good.
[103:29.76]I'll take the tuxedo.
[103:31.40]I'll be the dealer.
[103:35.48]Gems?
[103:36.76]I'll take gems.
[103:37.38]I already have gems.
[103:38.36]But I'll get rid of them.
[103:39.88]I don't want them.
[103:47.82]I'm not going to drop these.
[103:48.61]Don't worry.
[103:50.56]Now... I've got 500 grand.
[103:54.42]When did that happen?
[103:57.14]Alright, uh, there is... The thing I'm doing is over here.
[104:01.87]And then I just have to get back... Let me make sure I know where this is.
[104:05.53]This is just a safe house.
[104:09.12]No, no, no, this is... I have to meet Rebecca and her source later.
[104:12.00]Is that the safe house?
[104:12.70]I think it is, right?
[104:13.52]That's what that means.
[104:23.15]Let's do package.
[104:26.25]I need a... I'm gonna go save it.
[104:33.73]Go do Slappy?
[104:34.51]Let me save the game before I do anything.
[104:36.29]Stupid.
[104:41.81]This is the right way, right?
[104:44.49]No, it's behind me.
[104:45.37]Shit.
[104:45.63]Stupid.
[104:49.37]Stupid.
[105:03.26]All right.
[105:12.48]This is 9 p.m.
[105:13.70]I'm gonna keep the one... Yeah, this is fine.
[105:16.38]All right, so low down.
[105:25.97]Any food in here?
[105:29.29]Yeah, there's chips.
[105:35.37]I'm looking for a drink.
[105:36.13]Alright, I'll take it.
[105:41.61]Uh, drop this.
[105:42.21]I don't even... I don't want the gems.
[105:43.79]Fuck it.
[105:46.95]Okay.
[105:49.88]Let's go over here and actually do this before the time runs out.
[105:54.22]Maybe I'll be able to save you.
[105:57.82]Maybe.
[105:58.14]Maybe.
[106:04.32]There's Luz.
[106:08.44]Coming!
[106:37.07]Alright, get up!
[106:38.81]What do you want?
[106:39.29]What's happening?
[106:43.71]Good thing I got a strong swing.
[106:45.53]No problem.
[106:46.07]It's not safe out here.
[106:47.01]Come with me.
[106:49.13]If you follow me, I can take you to the safe house.
[106:54.74]I used to... I'm used to crowds on the prototype, but the fans aren't... Plus, swinging's good for my form.
[107:02.58]I just hope my favorite club can handle the extra punishment.
[107:05.98]Okay, you need to eat these right now.
[107:10.86]Can I not give you these?
[107:13.22]I found them in the trash.
[107:14.04]I'm not giving up my favorite club.
[107:16.45]Well, then I actually do not care if you die.
[107:18.85]So... That just tells me that I should not care if you live or die.
[107:38.38]I don't.
[107:39.36]I don't.
[107:39.80]Get up.
[107:40.24]You can do it.
[107:42.38]Take this.
[107:42.64]She's not going to take the orange juice.
[107:47.88]No, I wanted... I saw the orange juice.
[107:49.36]Go.
[107:53.10]Case.
[107:53.30]I'm going back to Case.
[107:54.12]Case is... I'm going to be... This is where I'm bringing her.
[108:00.53]Hey, I'm waiting on you.
[108:12.97]You're like a shark.
[108:13.67]You can detect orange juice, like blood.
[108:23.18]Talkin' comedy here.
[108:25.78]This thing has lasted pretty long, but it's sort of annoying to use.
[108:34.06]Get those shoes off?
[108:36.54]Nah.
[108:42.80]Thanks to you, I can still make the Pro Tour.
[108:46.76]Thanks for helping me out.
[108:47.34]I have a slice of what I got from the last leg of my Pro Tour.
[108:50.20]That sounds like a lot of money.
[108:53.63]There's a girl in here that's shopping with more money than you just gave me for your Pro Tour.
[109:03.25]Dynameat?
[109:04.20]Hunk of meat and dynamite.
[109:05.28]That's cool.
[109:08.26]So, where's this case?
[109:15.15]Quick meat on bone.
[109:20.16]Case is not in the safe house.
[109:29.57]Ah, okay.
[109:36.65]Did you just hear the gulp?
[109:37.65]I just did an audible gulp.
[109:41.96]Which one do I... It's probably going to have to be... This one is safe.
[109:46.79]It's possible to complete it from here.
[109:51.23]This one?
[109:53.59]Probably two.
[110:03.08]Can you not tell which save is the latest?
[110:04.56]No, I know which save is the latest.
[110:05.83]I'm just trying to not save over one that puts me in a good spot to not get locked out.
[110:11.51]There's nothing to do with when I saved it.
[110:13.41]It has to do with where is it.
[110:16.17]What part of the game.
[110:19.62]Yeah, okay, boomer.
[110:24.60]Okay.
[110:25.78]Zombrex?
[110:34.06]Yeah, okay, Boomer.
[110:37.07]Yep.
[110:48.10]Yeah, see you in, like, another three months when you guys come up with some other insult to tell people of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of a seasoned age!
[111:06.62]I'm trying so hard.
[111:08.72]I'm trying so hard right now to do this, but I couldn't do it.
[111:25.66]Gamble to 500,000.
[111:26.15]I don't have time to gamble.
[111:32.69]You have to be so... You can't be tardy at all.
[111:37.46]What is... What is this doing?
[111:44.29]Okay, gotta go up the... Upstairs.
[111:48.39]Is there a staircase?
[111:53.21]I know, I know, I know.
[111:54.13]I'm worried for Rebecca, but... Is there a... Where's the stairwell to get up there?
[111:58.62]Is it in the back?
[112:05.85]Are there stairs in the back, or do I have to actually go up, like, some other escalator or something?
[112:09.90]I don't think this is... There we go.
[112:15.40]But, I'm gonna eat a hamburger.
[112:18.02]We're good.
[112:20.92]You in here?
[112:37.54]A million dollars?
[113:06.39]What is going on in this game, man?
[113:09.75]I have to dump my million?
[113:11.08]I'm only halfway there.
[113:12.62]Oh no.
[113:34.29]I got... how much time to come up with a million dollars?
[113:45.92]Let's see.
[113:55.83]That's actually a pretty long time.
[114:00.17]That's enough time.
[114:02.56]Ooh, a steak.
[114:03.42]A steak and a spear.
[114:05.72]I'm going to take the spear.
[114:07.42]I'm going to replace the hamburger with a steak.
[114:19.13]Okay.
[114:20.47]Money.
[114:20.91]I've got to make money.
[114:21.87]We're going to get to a million dollars first.
[114:27.08]We have everybody knows Slappy.
[114:29.68]Which I'm going to try to make money on the way to Slappy.
[114:37.61]Oh, fuck Slappy.
[114:38.41]Who cares?
[114:38.79]This is right here.
[114:49.15]Mail order Zombrex.
[114:54.67]Get book on table.
[114:56.09]Book on table.
[115:00.19]Book on table.
[115:03.83]Gambling 2.
[115:09.82]Significant increase when playing gambling games.
[115:14.19]Oh, shit.
[115:14.87]Alright, let's go gamble.
[115:15.93]Where's that big machine?
[115:21.09]There's lots of food in here.
[115:25.40]Alright.
[115:26.76]Where's the big one?
[115:41.70]Okay, let's try it.
[115:52.51]100 bucks.
[115:53.91]Nothing.
[115:56.35]Come on.
[116:01.11]I gotta play more than one machine at a time.
[116:06.17]That's 2,400 bucks.
[116:22.38]Going to the money machine?

[142:40.70]Oh, no.
[142:40.92]I did the thing that people do in the casino when you just spam the button and you don't even care how much money you won.
[142:44.84]You just keep going.
[142:50.76]That's another 50k.

[145:04.76]My whole body hurts from the money machine.
[145:08.36]And it's only 4,000.
[145:10.44]I have almost doubled my money.
[145:22.83]I'm not stopping at a million, by the way.

[146:22.44]Million.
[146:29.12]I need more than a million dollars, though.
[146:31.12]I know that I'm already at the million, but... I'll be... I'll have zero dollars.
[146:51.68]Alright.
[146:52.36]Not bad.
[146:53.42]Not bad.

[147:54.47]I don't even know how much money I'm winning.
[147:56.73]I'm just winning.
[147:58.39]When you're hot, you don't get up.
[148:01.34]Uh oh, someone's calling me.

[148:46.41]I mean 1.18.
[148:46.67]1.18 million.
[148:55.37]You knew what I was trying to say.
[149:08.51]You guys told me to come here.
[149:10.77]If I remember reading that huge paragraph that people were spamming, it was to get the gambling book and come over here.
[149:17.79]You did this.
[149:18.73]I didn't.
[149:20.09]I was gonna just walk around and try to, like, rob people.
[149:23.70]And, like, smash stuff.
[149:34.10]Uh-oh.
[149:35.67]All right.
[149:37.33]Under 1.2 million.
[149:38.81]I'm out.
[149:39.09]Uh-oh.
[149:41.95]Uh-oh.
[149:45.47]Oh!
[149:45.91]That's it?

[150:33.73]But what about the car?
[150:37.99]Okay, let's go... Let's go do... I have a lot of time for this one.
[150:43.33]Barn burner that's way too far away.
[150:45.17]Bank run is right here.
[150:47.81]What would Jerma do?
[150:51.27]What would... What would... Is this what would Jesus do?
[151:03.64]What would John Wick do?
[151:12.06]Ego maniac.
[151:13.64]So you're Jesus now.
[151:15.50]I mean, I did just make... I did just win $700,000 on slot machines.
[151:19.17]I think there's something going on here.
[151:22.55]That don't happen unless you're the son of God.
[151:31.75]I'm kidding.
[151:32.39]Everybody relax.
[151:33.92]Jesus.
[151:35.12]Jesus Christ.
[151:38.55]Alright.
[151:39.37]We're gonna do... I can't do this one.
[151:42.77]We'll do Bank Run.
[151:43.41]Because it's right here.
[151:49.71]Let's go.
[152:03.88]I was trying to change the camera angle.
[152:06.94]Oh.
[152:09.50]Oh, if only you could see the face I just made.
[152:11.64]It was wild.
[152:13.86]You have no idea.
[152:25.17]Turn on the face cam.
[152:26.10]For fuck's sake.
[152:32.00]Settle down.
[152:40.93]Oh no.
[152:41.78]I have to turn right the fuck around and go in the door.
[152:45.62]I haven't saved since like $400,000.
[152:57.83]Whiteners let this thing happen.
[153:00.21]Letting zombies in.
[153:02.01]Foreigners in.
[153:03.01]Letting socialism in.
[153:05.80]Only way to get this country on track again is clean it right up of all those pansies, floozies, bureaucrats, liberals, and them half-assed conservatives too.
[153:16.30]This is a golden opportunity.
[153:19.91]Wait, are they on the roof?
[153:41.23]Apple pie was invented in the UK.
[154:15.71]Okay, um... I need a save point.
[154:21.77]So I'm gonna go over here.
[154:27.47]Oh, Johnny is right there.
[154:28.93]Johnny?
[154:30.75]Where's my save point?
[154:34.06]Where's the save point?
[154:39.70]Should I go up and just kill Johnny?
[154:41.30]No.
[154:44.45]I don't want to go that way.
[154:46.01]Save point.
[154:47.09]One that I can actually reliably get to.
[154:48.71]I do have to go that way.
[154:50.05]I have to turn right.
[154:51.76]Am I gonna get sniped?
[154:53.44]Am I gonna get sniped right now?
[154:54.98]I'm gonna get sniped.
[154:57.20]Just hug the wall.
[155:02.20]Hug the wall, and then there's a save point right in the middle.
[155:10.46]Go into the waterfall.
[155:15.79]Oh my god, that was so much damage.
[155:17.23]Oh my god.
[155:23.86]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[155:26.78]Oh my fucking god!
[155:28.40]It's insanity!
[155:29.66]Drink!
[155:42.91]Uhh...
[155:47.94]Alright, I'm going up there with a shotgun.
[155:49.66]Is there going to be a checkpoint when I go up here?
[156:11.56]What if I go this way?
[156:16.45]We're just looking for a save point that's over there.
[156:21.69]I can't even go in the bathroom.
[156:22.95]Okay, can I go across and then into the bathroom?
[156:38.52]You already have a checkpoint.
[156:40.52]Yeah, but I don't want to get another checkpoint if I accidentally... If I go up... That's what I'm saying.
[156:48.24]If I go up and I get an auto checkpoint and I die up there, then it's over.
[156:53.13]Is there a bathroom down here?
[157:02.49]Bathroom.
[157:03.09]Give me a bathroom.
[157:11.88]What the fuck is this bathroom?
[157:20.73]They're up there.
[157:22.92]You can just go back down?
[157:24.04]Uh...
[158:01.74]Where are they?
[158:11.60]Wrong roof.
[158:26.98]Where's the bathroom?
[158:28.76]There was supposed to be a bathroom over here.
[158:39.75]On the roof?
[158:41.89]Where's this bathroom?
[158:47.52]That's an elevator.
[158:49.23]That's not a bathroom.
[158:51.91]I thought these were bathrooms.
[158:53.83]Until right now in the game.
[159:06.03]Okay, so... Oh, that's very bad.
[159:10.05]Okay.
[159:12.66]The bathroom's in the middle.
[159:13.92]How the fuck am I gonna get there?
[159:19.78]How about Espresso?
[159:20.48]Yeah, but I thought... I know, I know.
[159:21.64]But, like, it just... There's the elevator thing.
[159:25.45]Oh.
[159:27.51]Okay.
[159:29.37]That's alright.
[159:29.81]We're good.
[159:31.15]Everything's good.
[159:31.67]I can get rid of the gambling book now.
[159:38.29]I just have to make it to the middle.
[159:42.20]Just go up there and fucking kill him.
[159:46.28]Alright, listen.
[159:47.32]Listen, Rambo.
[159:51.31]What if they keep killing me up there and I get stuck up there forever?
[159:57.54]Money.
[160:05.17]It just sucked over to him!
[160:07.19]What, it was connected to his body?!
[160:10.01]Explain it!
[160:10.85]Huh?!
[160:12.15]What happened?!
[160:16.51]I pressed it on the thing and it like... Over to the left onto the guy's body!
[160:20.99]Okay, well...
[160:36.35]Go watch your peep show.
[160:37.01]Are you trying to get me banned?
[160:46.29]Alright, where's the way to go up?
[160:47.53]Is it right over here, right?
[160:50.65]Actually, I'm kind of just... I'm safe right now.
[160:55.17]I don't even want to... It's right... The thing is here, I have to pee.
[161:01.47]I actually really do.
[161:06.91]What is going to happen in here, though?
[161:08.13]I don't know.
[161:11.09]This guy's going to get sniped and shit when we're running back this way.
[161:14.21]No, I've got him.
[161:14.97]I've got him.
[161:15.83]I've got him.
[161:18.79]I have to get to that save point first.
[161:35.36]Give me that cart.
[161:38.05]You have a checkpoint?
[161:40.21]Yeah, but the checkpoint is going to keep getting overwritten every time I leave a door, leave a building.
[161:51.41]I wonder if I can just... Is this fast enough to not get sniped?
[161:58.60]What do you think?
[162:02.06]Maybe?
[162:02.34]No.
[162:05.62]All right.
[162:06.16]Well, time to kill them.
[162:07.80]I'm not dicking around anymore.
[162:09.24]I got a shotgun.
[162:10.00]Let's go.
[162:10.38]I just did it.
[162:11.74]It's over.
[162:39.12]Johnny I have to time this so it's bang shoot Now what
[163:18.18]There's bricks over there.
[163:42.42]Ow!
[163:43.39]Ow!
[163:46.63]Oh, fuck.
[163:47.28]I used to reload, but wait, wait.
[163:49.04]Hold on.
[163:51.52]Dodge it.
[163:51.98]I need to reload.
[163:53.72]Fuck.
[164:08.59]Okay.
[164:19.86]Oh, I'm just staying still for that.
[164:21.10]I hate this.
[164:31.26]I hate this.
[164:31.74]He's so... Just rush him.
[164:33.50]No, I... No.
[164:35.12]Here we go.
[164:48.83]That's it what I mean, that's it oh
[165:15.78]He was spamming.
[165:16.72]No, I wasn't spamming.
[165:18.08]I was merely trying to dodge his attacks.
[165:22.90]Are there other people up here?
[165:33.15]There's three more on separate buildings.
[165:35.07]That sucks.
[165:40.85]What do you got?
[165:41.33]A suitcase full of money?
[165:42.95]Bacon.
[165:44.90]Okay, I have a sniper rifle now, though, so I can... The bricks were key, I think, in that whole scenario.
[165:53.78]In fact, I'm going to take a couple.
[165:55.86]Just because they did not fail me.
[165:57.58]Wait, I'm going to take a cheeseburger.
[166:00.34]Handgun.
[166:02.06]I'm going to drop the gambling book.
[166:06.12]Which book is this?
[166:06.66]That's blades.
[166:07.24]Keep that one.
[166:07.89]Gambling book?
[166:08.47]Who cares?
[166:09.05]I don't want it.
[166:10.35]And give me a hamburger.
[166:12.65]Hamburger.
[166:18.18]Now I can go save the game.
[166:29.25]Drop the brick for the gun.
[166:32.33]Take the gun.
[166:49.04]Okay, now I can save.
[166:55.62]Drop the brick for the book!
[166:57.83]Oh, no more books.
[167:02.85]Save the damn game.
[167:14.46]Why do I hear noises that are shooting sounds?
[167:41.46]Derek, you can't aim straight down like that.
[167:43.44]Is he just gonna shoot through the building?
[167:52.33]Alright, I gotta get up there.
[168:01.58]Or not.
[168:01.98]Maybe I... Can I get in there and save?
[168:03.64]I gotta climb up this shit and get him.
[168:08.72]Wait, can I...
[168:14.69]Bastard.
[168:17.74]Sniper duel?
[168:19.72]Do a snipe off.
[168:30.03]I actually do it?
[168:30.57]Do I actually have to do a snipe off with this guy?
[168:32.45]I can't get up on that roof, can I?
[168:36.11]Okay, like, I gotta clear this shit out.
[168:57.56]How am I supposed to snipe a mermaid?
[169:05.89]That does not... No, that's not gonna happen.
[169:08.75]I have to headshot him.
[169:13.99]That's not real.
[169:25.84]Alright, how do I get on the roof from here?
[169:30.31]So, onto the roof.
[169:31.85]Okay, so through here, obviously, right?
[170:00.46]I go find the clam person?
[170:02.06]If only I had a map.
[170:06.66]Yeah.
[170:08.74]I'm looking at it.
[170:09.68]I'm trying to see where I have to go.
[170:21.63]Who the fuck are all these people?
[170:28.87]Um...
[170:33.57]No, I don't have time to do this.
[170:48.00]Where's the fire, friend?
[170:49.04]If you looked outside, there were zombies everywhere.
[170:51.46]We need to get you all to safety.
[170:55.77]Wait just a second here.
[170:56.69]Let's not jump to conclusions.
[171:00.25]Hey, if we walk out there and you have that American flag on... We... We don't get shot at anymore, right?
[171:08.30]Is that how that works?
[171:13.12]Can't you see we're trying to have a game of poker here?
[171:14.87]Big stakes, pal.
[171:19.43]We could use another player.
[171:23.35]I...
[171:27.82]Hold on now.
[171:28.36]The only way I leave a game is if I'm out of chips.
[171:30.41]Beat us all and we'll go with you.
[171:34.85]My pappy used to say, money talks.
[171:37.77]I'm sure you could use some extra cash.
[171:39.93]More gambling.
[171:41.31]Just sit down and play some poker.
[171:42.85]Time's wasting.
[171:46.31]It's $100,000.
[171:47.17]Okay, I don't know how to play poker.
[171:55.91]I don't know how to play poker.
[172:01.67]What do I have?
[172:02.43]A two and an eight?
[172:06.15]That sucks, right?
[172:09.01]Put all my money in.
[172:12.95]Yeah, this thing sucks.
[172:24.08]Yeah, I don't know, like, I don't play poker.
[172:27.32]I'm a blackjack and baccarat guy.
[172:32.66]Six and four, that's terrible too.
[172:35.27]Six and four, offsuit.
[172:36.29]Dog shit, fold it.
[172:55.56]No, I would have lost.
[172:57.72]6-4 offsuit, I suck.
[172:58.86]Yeah, I would have gotten destroyed.
[173:05.72]6-4 offsuit, queen, 8-2.
[173:08.32]What do you got?
[173:09.16]Can we see the cards?
[173:24.05]Do we just never know what you have?
[173:31.99]Alright, now that's what I'm talking about.
[173:33.95]Alright, now, I don't understand the whole raising thing.
[173:38.75]And, like, the call.
[173:39.85]Check.
[173:41.43]Did she just put $44,000 on here?
[173:44.70]Wait, she put everything there.
[173:46.82]All in?
[173:47.64]Or I'm going all in!
[173:56.32]Oh, alright, here we go.
[173:58.52]Oh shit, I hope there's a bunch of kings.
[174:01.70]I hope there's a lot of kings here.
[174:03.32]Uh-oh.
[174:07.49]Wait, ten King Jack.
[174:09.81]Uh-oh.
[174:11.13]Uh-oh.
[174:13.38]Uh-oh.
[174:16.00]That was bad.
[174:24.76]I got a pair of 10s?
[174:27.14]A pair of 10s wins this hand?
[174:28.90]Holy shit, the guy had 9s.
[174:34.67]I just wiped everybody clean completely.
[174:39.09]It's just me and you, Jessica.

[175:35.89]Get out of here.
[175:39.83]That's fucking ridiculous.
[175:41.47]Why would you ever do something that stupid?
[175:55.24]Alright.
[175:56.16]Everybody stick around.
[175:57.08]We need to get some... I'm not fucking around.
[176:00.98]Who cares about this mission?
[176:02.58]Because I got three turn-ins.
[176:04.96]Two flushes in a row.
[176:08.68]We gotta go... We gotta go to the safe house.
[176:15.63]Look at my money.
[176:18.41]I'm a millionaire.
[176:20.03]Okay.
[176:20.83]This is important.
[176:23.67]How do we get the hell out of here without getting everybody sniped is the question.
[176:33.48]Because I don't know how to get out of this.
[176:38.66]I could wrap back around this way and get in the shortcut.
[176:44.49]Right?
[176:54.43]Let's go.
[176:55.57]Save the game first?
[176:58.01]Shit.
[176:58.75]Where?
[176:59.53]I can't go out here.
[177:00.41]The sniper.
[177:02.54]They just have to stay alive, but the sniper.
[177:08.68]Spend some of my winnings.
[177:11.70]Mermaid south.
[177:12.58]Mermaid south.
[177:15.12]Mermaid at shortcut.
[177:16.54]Mermaid at shortcut.
[177:18.20]Wait, wait.
[177:18.90]What do you mean?
[177:21.98]Rescue the mermaid.
[177:26.86]And then... I guess we could... Hold on a second.
[177:30.84]Give me a second.
[177:31.36]It's taking me a minute.
[177:33.03]So... Go... Get Mermaid.
[177:36.15]Go through here.
[177:37.99]Through the hotel.
[177:40.03]Through this way.
[177:41.27]Out around.
[177:41.99]All the way back around.
[177:49.48]Get Mermaid.
[177:50.42]And then just go the long way.
[177:51.46]Save the game here.
[177:55.67]Alright, that's the plan.
[177:56.75]That's what I'm going to try.
[177:59.57]Absolute journey.
[178:01.03]Yes.
[178:02.56]We need weapons for you guys.
[178:04.24]Let's see.
[178:04.94]You take this gun.
[178:06.42]Take a brick.
[178:07.98]You... This is about to break, so you take the sword.
[178:12.96]I'm trusting you with that.
[178:14.05]No, give me that back.

[180:29.67]There's too many people to... Okay.
[180:31.81]Put down the... The fish.
[180:36.64]It's not necessary.
[180:43.10]Straight through here.
[180:45.38]Into the save point.
[180:47.55]Right?
[180:47.71]Is that a bad idea?
[180:50.27]I'm gonna piss my pants if I don't go to the bathroom.
[180:55.24]Or this one.
[180:57.14]This is the shortcut, right?
[181:04.84]No.
[181:06.02]It's up.
[181:07.11]So I have to go to this one.
[181:13.49]That's so far.
[181:15.09]No, it's the green one.
[181:23.40]Where's the green one?
[181:25.06]Where's the green one?
[181:27.73]Second floor.
[181:28.37]Oh, I'm gonna pee!
[181:34.87]I have to pee.
[181:36.67]It's that dressing room in that second floor.
[181:38.39]It's this... Is it this one right here?
[181:49.49]This one.
[181:50.03]Right here?
[181:53.31]There it is.
[181:54.21]Okay.
[181:58.73]I gotta go up the stairs.
[182:00.81]So from here... So we gotta go out this way and then upstairs here.
[182:06.52]Alright.
[182:06.74]See you in a minute.
[185:00.97]Time does not count in this menu, does it?
[185:03.65]10, 25.
[185:03.79]No, it doesn't.
[185:17.80]Okay.
[185:20.18]Let us continue.
[185:21.00]So we're going up.
[185:31.44]So, let me... I'm gonna have the waypoint for here.
[185:36.70]Because that's where the stairs are.
[185:39.72]Let's move.
[185:48.03]You guys, you have to keep up.
[185:51.95]That's fine.
[186:04.38]Just don't get grabbed.
[186:07.16]Don't get grabbed.
[186:10.38]This is going to be tough, because they all have to be over here.
[186:12.64]This is going to be tricky.
[186:14.81]I have to do a couple spins.
[186:19.05]One, two, three, go.
[186:28.83]Upstairs.
[186:30.53]Upstairs.
[186:34.37]Made it.
[186:34.93]What the fuck is it?
[186:36.37]You.
[186:36.59]It's you, you, you.
[186:39.29]You and me.
[186:41.89]Me and you.
[186:50.55]What's it called?
[186:51.01]Oh.
[186:51.11]What?
[187:06.67]And I am on the second floor.
[187:10.22]There it is, okay.
[187:10.82]Brand new you.
[187:14.50]Yes.
[187:14.72]Yes!
[187:34.82]Are we good?
[187:35.64]Get in!
[187:36.38]You can do it, Jessica!
[187:37.70]Make it through!
[187:38.48]And we're off.
[187:47.49]Fantastic.
[187:49.77]And I got a save point right here.
[187:53.41]Can you believe it?
[188:04.14]Nice.
[188:11.80]Hot take?
[188:12.40]Zombies suck.
[188:15.16]Yeah, they do.
[188:16.80]They're incredibly annoying.
[188:18.24]They just cause a bunch of problems and shit.
[188:25.62]Let's go.
[188:33.19]Shouldn't be too hot.
[188:34.79]It should not be too hot to get over here.
[188:38.77]No, it is not hot.
[188:47.95]As Frank would say.
[188:48.77]Yeah.
[188:50.43]Fantastic.
[188:54.19]Oh, sorry.
[188:55.82]Hard.
[188:56.06]Yeah, I gotta use my broadcaster voice.
[189:00.58]It's really hard to do that.
[189:03.02]Sorry, guys.
[189:11.91]You just got insulted?
[189:17.16]This is a four turn in.
[189:20.64]Always go all in.
[189:22.24]In anything you do in life.
[189:25.86]Give 100%.
[189:26.04]Or don't give any.
[189:33.53]I'll bet on you any day.
[189:37.55]Gathered up some change from that fountain while I was stuck.
[189:41.01]Right?
[189:42.37]That's it.
[189:43.67]$5,000.
[189:45.71]That's a lot of escort.
[189:51.41]She was just standing.
[189:56.55]Level up again.
[189:57.14]Double level up.
[189:59.52]The fire spitter, toy spitball gun, and tiki torch.
[190:06.26]30,000 PP bonus.
[190:07.06]30,000 PP bonus.
[190:07.38]30,000 bonus.
[190:07.56]44,000 bonus.
[190:07.94]Judo throw.
[190:08.50]Okay, I gotta look at that.
[190:09.12]I gotta look at these new moves.
[190:41.69]Combo... Uh... Status.
[190:45.03]Skills.
[190:47.69]Snapshot.
[190:48.51]Yeah.
[190:50.17]Face cry.
[190:50.59]I haven't done this yet.
[190:53.69]RT and B. Quickly escape from a front grapple to deliver this devastating suplex.
[190:59.53]I've been doing that.
[191:01.77]This is the jump.
[191:02.61]Press right trigger and X in the air.
[191:04.50]It's the knee drop thing.
[191:05.56]Okay, so it's not just jump and X. It's jump, RT, and X. Walk like a zombie.
[191:10.18]Great way to go unnoticed.
[191:16.38]That's pretty good.
[191:18.64]And then quickly escape a rear grapple to give the zombie a toss.
[191:21.35]Just a taste of Frank's judo skills.
[191:22.79]So what we can do is hold both triggers and then hold B for three seconds.
[191:31.51]I got 2.1 million.
[191:33.07]Clothing locker.
[191:38.80]This'll work.
[191:46.28]Okay.
[191:48.42]We're all four pieces of the psychopath outfit to gain added abilities.
[191:57.90]Okay.
[191:59.26]Good.
[192:02.38]Now I have money to spend.
[192:04.46]I've saved the game.
[192:06.29]Where are we going?
[192:09.73]This, I still got lots of time to do 5-2.
[192:14.33]I need to bring $1 million to the Shell nightclub at 7 p.m.
[192:19.65]to pay Rebecca's ransom.
[192:22.35]So I've got a lot of time for this.
[192:24.64]This is at 7 p.m.
[192:26.64]Bank run.
[192:28.98]I'm going to go back in the... Get the car now.
[192:32.60]Buy car.
[192:33.96]Get car.
[192:36.18]Okay.
[192:36.70]Well, hold on a second there.
[192:40.01]Where's the car?
[192:42.53]Is it right here?
[192:44.25]It's closed.
[192:44.71]It's like right here.
[192:45.27]I need the key to the car.
[192:52.53]Alright, let's go to the pawn shop.
[192:58.62]This pawn shop right here has the keys, right?
[193:04.40]The key is a million dollars.
[193:05.40]I got it.
[193:13.21]Save it first?
[193:13.91]I just saved it right there.
[193:30.06]Didn't the game glitch out last time I tried to buy something?
[193:32.26]Yeah, it did.
[193:43.00]Alright, I'm gonna go up and then into the pawn shop.
[193:45.94]Do the zombie walk.
[193:52.56]Hold left trigger and right trigger and B for three seconds.
[193:56.98]One, two, three.
[194:04.71]Well, this is not a great way to get around.
[194:15.67]It's incredibly slow.
[194:23.13]It's really, really slow.
[194:29.37]It's pretty funny though.
[194:30.24]Yeah, humor and comedy sometimes is more important.
[194:38.60]Alright, what do you got?
[194:43.48]Ding dong.
[194:46.68]We got a laser sword, gem blower, Zombrex, salt rifle, tenderizers, no car key.
[194:58.89]Sports car key a million.
[195:05.40]Give me a fucking break.
[195:10.56]What did you take?
[195:16.78]Why does this have to happen every time?
[195:18.83]Like, it happens every single time.
[195:23.07]You think you're getting away with my shit?
[195:33.64]Did he walk in the store?
[195:34.84]Spawn three, psychos!
[195:40.70]Okay, cool.
[195:42.42]Give me the car.
[195:52.22]Give me the Zombrex.
[196:03.56]And give me... Why can I buy this twice?
[196:16.19]Buy the sword.
[196:18.23]Laser sword.
[196:29.76]That doesn't count as a sword.
[196:36.70]This does.
[196:37.20]Let's drop the fish.
[196:47.63]Get the mask.
[196:51.37]No.
[196:55.50]Alright, where's that car?
[197:03.22]down below, right?
[197:13.46]There it is.
[197:13.78]I see a woman in hot...
[197:32.50]Sports car key used.
[197:34.02]All right.
[197:45.97]Nice.
[197:53.58]Oh, what happened?
[197:59.31]Why can he not die?
[198:00.43]Alright, bank run.
[198:15.24]I can't take this with me.
[198:20.17]Can I pick up the car?
[198:37.63]That kind of sucks, but I have it now.
[198:45.63]That's a waste of a million dollars.
[198:47.03]That actually really sucks.
[198:50.19]It can only go through that one thing?
[198:58.39]What is going on?
[198:59.09]Oh, the snipers.
[199:01.53]The snipers.
[199:02.99]Uh-huh.
[199:10.35]Uh-huh.
[199:12.31]Oh, thanks, Derek.
[199:14.45]Okay.
[199:19.48]Well.
[199:22.18]The key is a one-time use item.
[199:34.39]Is that a lie?
[199:38.41]Key is not a one-time use.
[199:41.68]Okay.
[199:44.80]Alright, uh, I'm just gonna load checkpoint.
[199:54.61]Now, how the hell am I supposed to get... I have to... I went the wrong way.
[199:57.81]I'm gonna grab back...
[200:13.16]New uniform!
[200:15.41]Oh, okay.
[200:17.07]So to get to there, instead of- I'm gonna go... Let's go this way.
[200:30.66]So I gotta go... this way.
[200:41.19]I get to keep it in here, right?
[200:42.35]Yeah, I was going to say, that would be so stupid.
[200:45.49]Now, I have to go.
[200:47.15]Fuck, I have to go.
[200:48.68]We're going to do bank run.
[200:52.46]Bank run.
[200:55.16]I'm just going to drive around, okay?
[200:57.20]Bank run.
[200:58.16]Let's do it.
[200:59.64]Don't bring the thing that I... This is what winning looks like.
[201:09.97]I did it on this machine you scumbags And I'm gonna do it again Queen
[201:40.71]There it is.

[203:29.27]I don't even need to look at you!
[203:30.39]What's wrong with the car?
[203:36.34]Alright, turn left.
[203:53.38]And then I'm gonna go through here.
[203:54.76]Shit, I can't bring this out here.
[203:57.38]Look at how much money I have.

[204:35.66]Okay.
[204:38.44]Oh, so just... I have to wrap to the... Okay, I can go this way.

[206:05.28]Fucking stupid game.
[206:08.66]Dumb.
[206:09.98]Dumb fucking game.
[206:14.48]How many of you guys do that?
[206:16.18]I bet you a shitload of you guys do that.
[206:18.02]You're just in your room by yourself, and every time something happens to you in the game, you're just like, fucking stupid game, sucks.
[206:29.73]Just, you're just under your breath.
[206:31.57]Wait a minute, snipers?
[206:42.85]And if somebody's, like, in the house and they hear you doing that... It's like, what's going on in there?
[206:47.68]What's wrong?
[206:48.10]I did this bit already.
[206:49.58]Just pretend I said it already.
[206:55.96]Okay.
[206:57.38]Go.
[206:59.16]Bank run.
[207:05.90]I'm running out of time on this one.
[207:08.42]The Shamrock Casino.
[207:13.39]Where you at?
[207:16.17]Woodrow.
[207:18.39]Trying to, like, make a deposit?
[207:24.54]Hey.
[207:26.42]Hey, buddy, what the hell do you think you're doing?
[207:30.54]Prudency, young man.
[207:31.56]In just over one day's time, the military will rescue us from all this perfectly good money.
[207:35.70]I am Woodrow Weatherford, CEO and owner of one of the largest banks in the state.
[207:41.99]We can't let the cash in these ATMs go to waste.
[207:46.01]So you're going to pocket it before anything happens.
[207:49.75]Well, no one else is, and the yacht is a bit small.
[207:52.17]I could really use another boat.
[207:56.15]Money's going to be the least of your problems if a zombie gets you.
[207:58.29]Let me take you to the safe house.
[208:01.52]I will not let all this money go for nothing that will be letting those zombies win.
[208:06.78]If you want to help follow me and keep those zombies off my back.
[208:17.15]That's right.
[208:30.34]But you're running directly into him.
[208:32.36]You're not trying to get away from them.
[208:36.19]He's gonna get sniped.
[208:40.53]Oops, I caught ya.
[208:44.07]Alright, stop coming over here!
[208:48.29]Do your thing!
[208:49.86]Dude, do your thing!
[209:02.71]What is he doing?
[209:12.23]What?
[209:13.77]Keep... Is he running from me now?
[209:23.51]I don't know what's happening.
[209:25.11]I'm not sure if he's running away from me or not.
[209:30.25]Hurry up, son!
[209:30.95]Time's wasting!
[209:31.81]Alright, keep those off of me!
[209:39.29]Alright, open it!
[209:52.48]Open it!
[209:52.88]Do what you need to do!
[209:56.02]I keep hitting him with my backswing!
[210:04.79]Okay, go on.
[210:06.23]Do it.
[210:06.53]Go, go, go, go, go.
[210:07.27]Do it.
[210:15.05]This one's done.
[210:15.57]Let's make our way to the next one.
[210:16.47]I don't have a weapon.
[210:21.51]I need a weapon right now.
[210:25.38]All right, son.
[210:25.92]Time's a waste and we're gonna fulfill our duty.
[210:35.08]This is the last one.
[210:35.88]We're almost done.
[210:38.08]He's gonna get sniped.
[210:39.81]He's gonna get sniped.
[210:41.23]No, we can't.
[210:42.89]Woodrow, we can't go that way.
[210:44.85]Woodrow.
[210:46.66]Woodrow.
[211:00.75]I can't!
[211:02.85]I'm gonna die!
[211:03.59]I'm gonna die!
[211:05.61]I'm gonna die!
[211:06.33]Quick!
[211:07.35]Please!
[211:08.93]No!
[211:09.40]I don't know when he's gonna fire it!
[211:11.62]I need that!
[211:11.94]Give me the briefcase!
[211:12.54]Give me the briefcase!
[211:14.88]Quick!
[211:16.48]Eat the lobster!
[211:17.08]I'm rich!
[211:18.08]I have the briefcase!
[211:23.31]Go!
[211:31.53]Holy shit!
[211:32.53]Holy shit!
[211:38.95]This motherfucker's dead.
[211:49.36]Long legs of the law.
[211:50.74]A woman in a police uniform is shacking up in hot Exciterama.
[212:00.08]But if we have to go through the snipers, then they're just gonna get sniped.
[212:13.63]Kill the sniper.
[212:19.59]I mean, there's like four of them.
[212:25.01]Counter-snipe?
[212:25.63]That's not gonna work.
[212:36.53]Oh.
[212:37.15]Don't... Nobody look at the screen.
[212:46.25]You alright?
[212:46.71]I just played one in the peephole.
[212:58.31]Why'd he get a bowling pin?
[213:01.07]I like to use props when I'm... I like to go bowling.
[213:05.33]I'm really good at it, and that's why I always keep a bowling pin with me.
[213:12.63]Because I'm really good at getting strikes and stuff.
[213:19.83]Okay, can we keep having... Can we talk?
[213:23.01]Can we have another conversation?
[213:25.61]There's a book over there.
[213:29.55]Wait, what's this book?
[213:30.67]This isn't a raw... I've had to pick up the book.
[213:38.40]Get a 10% boost from female survivor-related activities.
[213:43.88]I guess we're doing that.
[213:51.70]Say no more.
[213:52.20]Alright, I got you.
[213:55.14]Okay, I need...
[214:00.69]Weapons and stuff.
[214:02.59]What the fuck is in here?
[214:12.49]Good.
[214:12.89]Alright.
[214:13.69]What about... What's this?
[214:14.93]Is this a bathroom?
[214:17.45]This is a secret way to go.
[214:22.19]Oh, shit.
[214:22.89]Okay.
[214:24.19]I need to go back over here.
[214:29.95]We have to deposit this person.
[214:35.19]Either that or... Alright, I'm gonna start to run out of time.
[214:40.71]I need some weapons.
[214:52.74]How you doing on health?
[214:55.62]I'll just keep this in case you need it.
[214:57.52]Ooh, there's a maintenance room.
[215:05.59]Let's just check and see what they want us to do.
[215:12.33]What's in here?
[215:12.85]Machete?
[215:14.47]Okay, I can make the spear.
[215:17.17]I'm gonna do that.
[215:20.87]This counts as a weapon, right?
[215:22.97]This counts as a knife?
[215:26.24]How does this not count for the book?
[215:30.27]Hey Frank, there's some people sitting down in a theater at the Slot Ranch Casino.
[215:33.81]It's like they're waiting for a show to start or something.
[215:37.07]Where the hell are they?
[215:43.14]I mean, that's on the way, but I... Let's try it.
[215:45.92]End of the save point right there.
[215:48.20]Alright.
[215:49.58]We're gonna go there.
[215:51.72]I'm gonna rescue those people.
[215:53.28]We're gonna go and then deposit.
[215:58.56]Speed it up!
[216:08.82]They're actually... They're still alive.
[216:12.92]There really is plenty of time.
[216:14.02]There is.
[216:15.52]And I don't mean that in, like, a funny laugh-out-loud-look-plenty-of-time reference.
[216:20.98]Yeah, it's... We just have to go this way.
[216:22.39]Debbie!
[216:27.09]Debbie!
[216:30.07]Debbie!
[216:43.70]Debbie!

[217:02.39]You need this heal.
[217:04.23]Stop!
[217:05.07]She's fucking out of her mind.
[217:06.79]She's gonna die.
[217:08.51]I have to give you a heal.
[217:11.41]Get over here.
[217:12.23]There's a spot right here.
[217:12.99]Come here.

[217:35.31]I was like, why did my machete just shoot?
[217:44.93]Does she still- I think I just got saved by the cutscene.
[218:01.26]This is why I was coming here.
[218:18.00]The dumb look on my face.
[218:19.40]Shoot the detonator out of her hand.
[218:45.52]Game's too quiet?
[218:46.66]Well, I turned it down because the cutscenes were so loud.
[218:49.26]Uh... Okay, don't move.

[222:10.10]Oh, I hate this.
[222:17.35]Get the fuck out of here.

[222:34.70]And get me the fuck out of here.
[222:43.96]God.
[222:45.29]I will say though, let me tell you.
[222:48.45]The zombies in Dead Rising are the most unbearable to deal with in any zombie game.
[222:52.97]And it's by design, and it's actually pretty great.
[222:55.72]People are too scared to, like, have the zombies actually hurt you.
[223:00.36]Here.
[223:06.49]Now what?
[223:06.77]I'm not dressed for this show.
[223:10.35]I cannot work under these conditions.
[223:14.71]Go spiff yourself up or this show is going to end with a bang.
[223:18.15]What?
[223:18.39]I'm dressed for the occasion.
[223:19.47]I look just like you.
[223:30.03]Go spiff yourself up.
[223:33.17]Oh, no, don't throw that.
[223:34.19]I want you to go here.
[223:36.33]I need to get a tuxedo?
[223:41.66]Come on, man.
[223:42.42]Where's a tuxedo when you need one?
[223:44.90]A tuxedo?
[223:46.94]Is that one backstage?
[224:07.23]There's no...
[224:12.54]Talk to Allison.
[224:14.54]She won't be satisfied with anything less than a tuxedo.
[224:16.98]Yeah.
[224:19.44]I think they carry them in the Modern Businessman in the Royal Flush Plaza.
[224:30.95]I can't just throw this into her head.
[224:38.09]Modern Businessman.
[224:39.09]Modern Businessman.
[224:41.84]Modern businessman.
[224:47.42]Modern businessman.
[224:48.34]Modern businessman.
[224:49.29]Modern businessman.
[224:50.53]Modern businessman.
[224:59.43]It's actually pretty close.
[225:00.15]Alright, so is Deidre going to stay?
[225:04.69]Just go backstage, Deidre.
[225:06.75]I don't want to put you in harm's way.
[225:09.80]She'll stay here, right?
[225:15.93]She's gonna die?
[225:19.55]Will she just... I have to take her?
[225:22.93]They only take damage if you leave them alone.
[225:24.81]God damn it.
[225:26.99]Eat a pizza.
[225:28.07]Just come over here and eat this pizza.
[225:30.47]Eat it.
[225:34.39]And I'm gonna give you a wrench.
[225:41.99]Here.
[225:43.85]Here.
[225:46.74]Let's go.
[225:56.29]Give me a fucking break.
[225:58.86]Like, honest to God.
[226:02.08]What a total fucking joke.
[226:03.90]And it's all gone!
[226:17.44]It's funny.
[226:18.78]It's kind of funny.
[226:20.84]Yeah, it's funny.
[226:24.04]Now I gotta take you back.
[226:26.56]Case 5-2 needs to be done.
[226:28.50]You know what?
[226:29.66]Fuck it.
[226:30.24]I don't care.
[226:30.70]I'm not gonna sit here.
[226:32.18]You dumbass AI gonna walk into a zombie and die.
[226:37.54]Am I your man, Mr. Dumbass?
[226:41.62]Dumbass.
[226:43.46]The name is Dumas.
[226:47.48]That's pretty thick-headed.
[226:49.68]Same thing like an ice-cold A&W root beer.
[226:51.97]She wouldn't even fucking... She was not even fucking here with me.
[226:54.33]Was not even here.
[226:55.35]How is that possible?
[226:56.73]It's not even possible.
[226:57.99]This way!
[227:01.45]Imbecile.
[227:04.50]Hurry it up!
[227:05.36]Hey, I'm waiting on you!
[227:08.89]I'm trying to feed her!
[227:25.66]Imbecile!
[227:31.62]You get grabbed more than anybody in the whole game!
[227:36.47]She's been grabbed like six times.
[227:38.01]It's like, you're the only person that gets grabbed.
[227:41.17]Heaven of the pineapple.
[227:51.50]Alright, I need a tuxedo.
[227:57.55]Done.
[228:03.07]Is that all I need?
[228:05.87]Do I need, like, special shoes?
[228:19.60]Take off the hat.
[228:21.46]How do I lose the hat?
[228:24.44]I don't know how to lose the hat.
[228:25.64]Can I lose the hat?
[228:26.58]No, I just got into college clothes.
[228:34.69]I can't take that up.
[228:36.73]I can't take that up.
[228:39.79]I can do it backstage?
[228:40.61]Okay, good.
[228:42.03]Speed it up.
[228:46.73]Follow me.
[228:52.51]Oh, man.
[228:53.21]It's taken a lot to not do that to you.
[229:02.74]Okay.
[229:03.88]Now, we just gotta go right here.
[229:09.38]Let's go!
[229:09.96]Don't get grabbed.
[229:19.11]Don't get grabbed.
[229:21.45]Hi.
[229:24.73]You are mighty tasty.
[229:26.03]Can you feel it, handsome?
[229:30.75]It's almost time for the show.
[229:31.93]But where's my audience?
[229:33.94]Won't you round up some fans for the show?
[229:40.93]Fans.
[229:46.13]There's like five people here.
[229:47.37]That's all you're gonna get.
[230:07.08]How many more?
[230:09.04]Come on, let's go!
[230:18.32]Come on!
[230:26.28]Ah, my adoring fans!
[230:27.48]A few more and the show will begin.

[231:08.04]Jesus Christ.
[231:14.00]Get backstage!
[231:20.62]Start the show?
[231:21.16]Alright.
[231:25.34]So drop the stage light on her head.
[231:27.48]You mean we're not done now?
[231:49.06]Oh, surely you're not suggesting that after all this, I don't give my adoring audience what they want?
[231:57.51]The comeback tour everyone's waiting for?
[232:00.19]The big number?
[232:01.89]I might get a little angry if that happens.
[232:13.41]I love the voice of reason.
[232:14.41]I like that guy.
[232:17.73]Let's just chat.
[232:18.35]Come on, man, just do it.
[232:19.71]So... what?
[232:20.15]Where am I?
[232:20.99]What do I have to do?
[232:43.95]Press a button?
[232:45.15]Circle?
[232:46.87]Oh fuck, it's a rhythm game.
[233:02.00]Deidre is just- Deidre, don't get too close to the pyrotechnics.
[233:11.67]How is that wrong?
[233:15.21]Why?
[233:15.63]How is that wrong?
[233:25.06]What?
[233:32.14]This... That does not work correctly.
[233:35.70]What the hell was going on there?
[233:37.50]Why is she...
[233:44.28]How did she just fly?
[233:52.14]I pressed it.
[233:52.80]What the fuck?
[233:54.96]Something's not right here.
[233:55.78]Something's not right here.
[234:16.05]Is it the frame rate?
[234:17.05]No, I don't think so.
[234:22.14]So then she gets eaten by her fans.
[234:27.98]Yep.
[234:44.34]This is how it ends.
[234:46.32]They start eating her and killing her, and that's how it works.
[234:50.82]And we get a really good picture.
[234:54.36]Wait, she's... Um, I need a better weapon than that.
[235:04.57]I don't want to accidentally kill her.
[235:05.81]Okay, so... Don't hit her!

[240:07.65]We're almost there.

[240:27.69]Shake it off, Juan.
[240:29.71]No.
[240:32.12]Shake it off.
[240:33.68]Shake it off.
[240:34.26]Shake it off.
[240:34.78]Shake it off.
[240:37.06]You can do it.
[240:37.62]Shake it off.
[240:43.54]Come on, Juan.
[240:45.55]Come on.
[240:47.07]Can't leave Juan behind.
[240:56.38]Dude, what are you doing?
[241:11.78]Why did they run into my gun?
[241:15.14]Why would you do that?
[241:17.02]Everybody's so stupid.
[241:18.92]I killed them at the door.
[241:22.25]Ow, my stomach.
[241:33.92]Everyone's okay.
[241:35.42]Everyone's fine.
[241:49.85]Reset.
[241:51.15]I'm not gonna reset.
[241:53.58]Oh, my throat is like fucking killing me right now.
[242:00.91]I gotta go.
[242:01.77]I didn't fuck it up.
[242:16.18]Deirdre fucked it up.
[242:17.72]Because I didn't tell them to stay.
[242:20.58]So she just ran in front of my gun and fell down when I shot her in the head.
[242:25.02]And then I closed the door and killed Juan with the door.
[242:30.05]That's the way it falls.
[242:32.15]I'm not going back.
[242:41.59]Hold on.
[242:45.84]Jesus, that was so funny.
[242:47.98]Alright, I have to go now.
[242:59.21]But to be fair, a psycho, one of those guys had like a grenade in his hand.
[243:03.29]He was running straight for Juan, so I had to try to save him.
[243:09.65]Let's do, I don't know, day three at... This one at 11 a.m.
[243:17.62]Oh, no, this one at... Yeah, this one here.
[243:27.16]Running into guns.
[243:29.88]You guys are so stupid.
[243:32.92]Why would you run into my gun?
[243:34.64]Alright, do I have enough to go get some healing?
[243:40.60]I need to go to the... Wait, hold on.
[243:43.60]Cafeteria.
[243:45.26]Where's the cafe?
[243:47.92]Right there.
[243:52.22]Now I have a headache.
[243:55.61]Shit.
[244:04.84]That was like too... That was like too funny too quickly.
[244:09.49]Okay, let's move.
[244:11.47]I gotta go from here.
[244:12.57]Excuse me.
[244:16.51]I got the million dollars.
[244:19.14]Did you hear that burp?
[244:19.80]That was like a stress burp.
[244:20.88]Alright.
[244:23.68]So I can do the shortcut.
[244:25.58]Right?
[244:26.86]The shortcut will bring me up there closer.
[244:37.64]Yeah, it will.
[244:39.40]So I should have time.
[244:40.98]So the shortcut is right here.
[244:42.26]Correct me if I'm wrong.
[244:43.34]Am I wrong?
[244:43.96]Is the shortcut not right there?
[244:51.77]It's wrong.
[244:52.81]Which one is it?
[244:54.99]I know it's right here somewhere.
[244:55.91]Right here?
[245:00.78]Just go the long way.
[245:01.84]Why would I go the long way?
[245:03.38]There's no time.
[245:07.27]It's the other bathroom.
[245:08.79]It's in Royal Flush.
[245:10.95]Oh, so it is in Royal Flush.
[245:15.52]Oh, so I had it right.
[245:16.50]The men's room, not the women's.
[245:19.27]Yeah, it's the right spot.
[245:40.55]My eyes hurt right now.
[245:55.16]Right at the very end.
[245:56.68]Yeah.
[245:58.44]I'm so disappointed.
[245:59.88]But it was too funny.
[246:04.89]Okay.
[246:06.25]We're good.
[246:08.13]Just have to give a million dollars.
[246:16.10]Hey, any leads?
[246:17.20]Frank, there's a tall guy walking around in a clown suit.
[246:20.78]He's yelling at the zombies in the platinum strip near the arena.
[246:23.56]Tall guy?
[246:25.84]Well, how long will he be around for?
[246:36.50]Snow job.
[246:38.15]Investigate the clown car.
[246:40.99]Well, that's right in front of me.
[246:44.15]Um...
[246:48.42]I need to go there.
[246:54.80]It's just going to automatically start.
[246:58.26]Just don't go to the clown car.
[246:59.56]Yeah, I have to do the case.
[247:17.78]This is not a plenty of time scenario.
[247:19.52]It's not.
[247:20.84]It's gonna move this way.
[247:21.82]Just get it done.
[247:29.24]I... Actually, it was what I needed to do.
[247:58.81]Okay.
[248:02.09]Now, this is not a case where the person's gonna be like... Two fire axes.
[248:12.76]This is gonna be a scenario where the person's like, Oh, you brought the money, but it wasn't enough.
[248:17.12]It's 1.2 million.
[248:26.69]I wanted to pick up the beer.
[248:52.23]She's not my girlfriend.
[248:54.07]Stop.
[248:54.57]Idiot.
[248:57.67]Leave me alone.
[249:01.19]She's not my girlfriend.
[249:32.73]Have a drink, Frank.
[249:36.15]Nice work, Frank.
[249:37.69]For once.
[249:39.07]Is it a knife?
[249:41.31]Where's Rebecca?
[249:42.29]It's a sword.
[249:43.15]TK doesn't really appreciate all your interference, Frank.
[249:48.86]You really need to learn to mind your own business.
[249:53.38]You secure him.
[249:55.00]Talk that idiot protester into doing your job.
[249:57.36]I'm too dumb to know you're behind me.
[249:59.02]Actually, I'm smart.
[250:03.12]Do I have to fight two people at the same time?
[250:04.81]How many shots do I have in my sniper rifle?
[250:27.95]This is not gonna be fun.
[250:34.27]I have a fire axe, a coffee pot, and a sniper rifle I don't know how to use.
[250:39.56]This is gonna go very well.
[250:40.90]Wait, I have the... I have the...
[251:01.07]No, they tag out.
[251:05.66]What was that move?
[251:10.58]I wish I had a sword!
[251:11.64]Where's the other one?
[251:44.92]What a terrible heal.
[251:55.48]Holy crap!
[252:06.16]Why do you guys get to do this shit at the si- They get butt-picks.
[252:14.17]Uh, I think something's way more... important than that.
[252:17.63]And that's not dying.
[252:32.16]Is there, like, guns back here?
[252:33.10]There's a lot of beards.
[252:34.48]This is bad.
[252:38.08]This is bad.
[252:46.28]Don't read, like, dirty magazines right now.
[252:48.14]Fuck.
[252:56.47]Where's she-
[253:12.57]Holy shit!
[253:18.43]I can't stop throwing up, but I need to heal!
[253:53.78]What's wrong with my run?
[253:56.24]Am I alright?
[253:56.68]Am I stuck on like an invisible thing?
[254:00.68]How do I stop on her?
[254:11.90]How do I step on her head?
[254:14.36]Oh no, I'm in trouble.
[254:15.68]I'm alright.
[255:01.16]I need my fire axe.
[255:03.76]Give me the fire axe back.
[255:06.72]Okay, just do some dodging.
[255:08.09]As long as I get rid of one of them.
[255:17.07]Oh, that was bad.
[255:20.46]Fuck you.
[255:32.20]Back off!
[256:05.93]I don't know what I'm trying to say.
[256:10.74]I'm trying to say I'm okay for now.
[256:36.95]Almost one down.
[256:37.67]Come on.
[256:37.91]Nope.
[256:38.09]Come on.
[256:46.15]Where are you going?
[256:48.96]That was terrible.
[256:49.66]It didn't do anything.
[256:59.85]One more.
[257:00.43]Get out of my way.
[257:02.15]One down.
[257:10.36]Is that it?
[257:10.78]What have you done?
[257:12.86]This is not like an Ornstein and Smaug scenario, right?
[257:14.70]Like, she's not gonna get huge and start lighting abilities.
[257:17.48]She was my other half.
[257:22.12]But you'll pay.
[257:23.37]You will never get out of here alive, Frank.
[257:27.83]We promise you that.
[257:30.15]All of us.
[257:40.63]It really is that scenario, isn't it?
[257:42.49]Here comes phase two.
[257:44.65]Well, that was easy.
[258:08.53]I don't think she did the power up right.
[258:10.37]I don't think so either.
[258:12.17]Wrong sword.
[258:31.85]Are you kidding me?
[258:33.13]Are you kidding me?
[258:33.81]Tick, tick, tick.
[258:34.49]The next case will occur at 7 p.m.
[259:06.09]Alright, save it.
[259:18.58]It's for points.
[259:21.80]Oh, look at all this time I got.
[259:23.66]And we have not one, but two katana swords.
[259:30.29]And we're going to get a
[259:37.84]I'm gonna get... Alright.
[259:40.14]Can I take the sword out?
[259:41.36]That looks like a good sword.
[259:42.34]Can I take it out of her chest?
[259:43.70]I don't think so.
[259:46.66]Let me make sure I have everything that I need.
[259:49.38]We're good.
[259:49.98]What is that?
[259:50.38]Whipped cream.
[259:58.73]What else is here?
[259:59.87]Battery.
[260:00.85]Money.
[260:04.31]What do I have for heals?
[260:07.98]Pretty much nothing.
[260:08.64]I need some more heals.
[260:10.39]Replace the machete with the vodka.
[260:13.09]And... What's this?
[260:15.77]Edge weapons, right?
[260:16.65]Oh, that's going to be good.
[260:19.79]Erotic magazine.
[260:22.31]Just leave it.
[260:22.85]What do I have here?
[260:23.41]Alright.
[260:25.89]Now we have fetching females.
[260:30.11]Investigate the grotto.
[260:32.71]That's kind of like right here, isn't it?
[260:36.84]And then Snowjob is down there.
[260:43.81]Kind of annoying that I lose the money.
[260:46.75]And they still try to fucking kill me.
[260:55.08]Let's go.
[261:02.36]Sword?
[261:03.54]No, stand.
[261:13.51]Dude, this is my favorite music for every recent top-down spaceship Galaga type shooter.
[261:21.43]The waves of enemies.
[261:29.28]And by the way, it's every level.
[261:31.74]Hope you like that song.
[261:38.37]I can't slide down.
[261:47.34]Okay.
[261:48.04]Save point.
[261:48.72]Hmm.
[261:49.74]Ah, there's one behind me.
[261:51.12]Ah.
[261:51.52]I did just save it, though, didn't I?
[261:53.52]Confirm with me, please, that I just saved the game, like, 15 seconds ago.
[261:58.50]I did, right?
[262:01.06]Yep.
[262:01.52]Thank you.
[262:01.82]This way.
[262:18.24]That's a pretty cool move for that weapon.
[262:21.08]And I have the book with it, so it'll last a long time.
[262:23.65]Okay, Sports Town.
[262:42.16]Huh?
[262:49.77]Am I gonna beat this tonight?
[262:50.83]I'm gonna try.
[262:58.08]What's the deal?
[262:58.66]Is it upstairs?
[263:00.12]Yeah.
[263:03.06]Okay, there's Nina, Korra, and Summer.
[263:10.84]Wow, you're a lot cuter than those zombies.
[263:14.64]Honey, don't mind if I'm a little forward, but are you single?
[263:19.94]I'd love to get to know you a little more intimately.
[263:21.78]What's going on?
[263:27.32]Am I sure this is not like... I opened up like a VR pornography video game?
[263:39.41]Thank you.
[263:39.73]Guys are always coming after me.
[263:40.77]They're not like this.
[263:44.82]You had better come with me back to the safe house.
[263:49.52]We'd like to, sugar, but we aren't just any girls.
[263:53.14]Our time is money and we don't go with anyone without settling the bill first.
[263:57.29]Everyone wants money.
[264:00.97]$10,000 and we're all yours.
[264:02.37]We won't move for a dime less, baby.
[264:04.25]You know you want to.
[264:12.17]Let's go.
[264:18.47]Are you all... Are you capable?
[264:20.93]I don't want to give somebody a katana.
[264:22.71]This is all very, very good stuff.
[264:24.29]Here.
[264:26.21]Here.
[264:26.67]You take the... You take the axe.
[264:31.07]I don't want to give you, like, one of these.
[264:33.05]Something else.
[264:33.63]Like a super soaker or something.
[264:39.77]Oh, there's a slide!
[264:41.47]Use the slide!
[264:47.53]Ready?
[264:53.11]Whoa.
[264:57.74]That was really fun.
[264:58.66]Alright, let's get them back.
[265:07.33]So, I need to go upstairs into the shortcut.
[265:10.63]Uh-huh.
[265:13.33]Yeah.
[265:15.45]That sounds like a plan.
[265:16.65]We're gonna go up to the shortcut.
[265:24.21]That was his real voice.
[265:27.46]Maybe.
[265:28.34]Take a pic.
[265:31.00]Take a pic of Bob.
[266:00.22]Oh, we're gonna- we're gonna go on the- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[266:13.27]Make it!
[266:13.53]Make it!
[266:13.79]Make it!
[266:14.03]Make it!
[266:14.29]Make it!
[266:14.53]Just walk forward and make it!
[266:15.70]You can do it!
[266:16.42]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[266:19.08]Break it off!
[266:19.76]Break it off!
[266:20.20]Break it off!
[266:20.64]Break it off!
[266:21.08]Break it off!
[266:21.52]Break it off!
[266:21.94]Break it off!
[266:23.26]Break it off!
[266:24.60]They're not breaking it off?
[266:28.81]They're both just dead.
[266:30.61]Like, seriously.
[266:32.75]That strategy sucks.
[266:34.50]Like, 30 to 40% of the time.
[266:35.78]And it...
[267:01.29]They need weapons?
[267:08.25]No, they don't.
[267:10.07]I've had people run forward before and not have to have a weapon to get out.
[267:23.12]Excuses.
[267:24.18]Excuses.
[267:42.29]I can't promise it'll be a good weapon, but it'll be something.
[267:44.77]Here.
[267:46.11]I'll give... I'll give you a... Okay, how about... Who wants a... Chainsaw?
[267:59.21]Here you go.
[267:59.75]Nina, this has got your name all over it.
[268:07.91]She won't take the chainsaw.
[268:10.58]Well, I'll take the chainsaw, and I'm gonna get rid of... Painkiller.
[268:33.35]Hey, I'm waiting on you!
[268:44.32]Any more vodkas I can use?
[268:47.06]Melon and... Something else.
[268:50.82]Melon and cocktail.
[268:56.04]Stay over there.
[269:00.96]Give her some whipped cream.
[269:04.70]Maybe.
[269:05.22]I need another drink.
[269:06.75]A beer.
[269:08.43]And... This cocktail is sitting on the table right there.
[269:13.96]I can make another one.
[269:22.35]That's actually all I can take.
[269:24.25]Randomizer?
[269:26.19]Okay.
[269:27.39]Listen up!
[269:31.72]Go over there.
[269:36.64]So go.
[269:37.00]Move it!
[269:43.88]I hate to do this, but seriously... It's a weapon.
[269:52.53]In the whipped cream container.
[269:53.67]Come here.
[269:56.86]You won't take it.
[269:58.22]I think it's kind of fun to use.
[270:05.16]Alright, well, whatever.
[270:06.90]I don't want to get... You take the super soaker.
[270:12.45]Will you take this?
[270:15.12]Okay, good.
[270:17.60]Now, we're ready.
[270:19.74]Not that hard to go now.
[270:24.94]We just have to go upstairs.

[274:02.60]I kind of need that.
[274:06.80]A Sludge Hammer and a Fire Axe.
[274:10.64]I'm thinking that's a good one.
[274:16.03]Does that count as a Blunt or a Sharp Weapon?
[274:33.55]Well, I got a pretty good setup here.
[274:37.79]So, the getaway.

[274:43.18]I have to stop him.

[274:47.20]Only one.
[274:49.88]So, this probably takes a while, but there's only one case here.
[274:58.79]Do I have enough time to do this snow job?
[275:01.55]Let's find out.
[275:24.42]I need a fire axe and a sledgehammer.
[275:27.07]But I ain't gonna get it.
[275:37.33]He's not that far.
[275:39.57]I could get in the car and just drive down.
[275:44.00]Where's that car?
[275:46.28]I always forget.
[275:46.98]I always forget where the car is.

[276:58.90]Hold on, I just realized that this car sucks.
[277:03.16]Well, there's a reason to take the car, because I don't want to get sniped.
[277:06.54]I could have just walked to the left and opened the door.
[277:08.78]I know I'm realizing that now, don't worry.
[277:11.72]Wait, don't, just, I don't need to go that fast, there's tons of time.

[280:12.70]Let's see if I can get it.
[280:13.94]I want to get a good picture.
[280:14.72]I got time for a good photo.
[280:21.57]Is that even going to hurt me?
[280:35.45]Just drive into him.
[280:55.95]He's too tall!
[280:57.61]He's actually too tall, I gotta throw shit at him.
[281:01.17]Can I knock him over?
[281:15.38]What's this one do?
[281:15.94]I think I just have to bash him.
[281:29.84]Rocket?
[281:37.04]You're taking 50% less damage.
[281:40.50]That's pretty great.
[281:41.84]Alright, let me try one of the other weapons.
[281:54.11]Fountain Firework.
[281:55.25]Eat this.
[281:55.67]I bounced off of that stupid zombie's head.
[282:06.29]There was ice cream on the ground though.
[282:07.41]I kinda wanna eat it.
[282:12.76]Oh no!
[282:13.32]Is this a... I just got humiliated.

[282:44.29]No!
[282:45.13]Fuck!
[282:47.07]Oh my god!
[282:48.09]I wonder if there's something up here I can use.
[282:57.47]Have you tried a gun?
[282:58.99]I don't have any guns.
[283:05.53]I have a power drill.
[283:07.55]What about the car?
[283:11.68]I can't get in the car.
[283:19.78]Just throw shit at him?
[283:22.68]When he freezes you like this, it's fucking annoying.
[283:25.69]Frank, there are fireworks going off at the stage at the Atlantica Casino.
[283:29.29]Strange time to be performing on Wednesdays.
[283:37.71]Do anything!
[283:54.82]I guess I could just run into him and then run away.
[284:05.83]No, no, that's not gonna work.
[284:07.98]I'm dead.
[284:16.86]Get on your own stilts, that would be great.
[284:22.95]Dude, if I could like activate a fucking city-wide fucking zombie detonation.
[284:29.09]These motherfuckers are in the way, always!
[284:36.76]Like, I wish I could just delete the zombies from the boss fights.
[284:44.48]You haven't!
[284:45.08]But no, I'm talking about the entire thing!
[284:47.40]Like, ALL game!
[284:48.64]WHOLE game!
[284:49.56]EVERY game!
[285:03.24]I'm just throwing benches at this guy.
[285:07.45]What?
[285:15.07]This is so stupid.
[285:24.74]Jumping and swinging the sword was good.
[285:27.24]Well, until all these zombies surrounded me.
[285:29.44]Jesus Christ almighty.
[286:01.95]No!
[286:06.58]Randomizer?
[286:07.22]All right, well, it's a puke.
[286:52.06]If I had the rifle I'd shoot him in the head
[287:15.98]Okay, if I keep throwing up, man, it doesn't stop.
[287:23.21]It doesn't stop.
[287:24.41]It doesn't stop.
[287:26.70]I can't.
[287:27.74]It's always puking.
[287:29.36]I'm always throwing up.
[287:34.30]What?
[287:38.03]It hasn't done the full animation yet, so I keep getting stuck.
[287:53.86]Oh my goodness.
[288:22.39]I fucking hate this fight.
[288:24.15]I hate this fight.
[288:25.89]I hate this fight.

[288:31.54]You little gremlin!
[289:16.42]Too cold, too cold.

[291:21.60]The car has a butt.
[291:25.28]Yeah, kinda does.
[291:33.84]He drove back for a sword, but not the wand.
[291:36.68]The sword was useful.
[292:12.91]Alright.
[292:25.41]We're just turning around and going straight.
[292:30.75]Get a pick of the ass.
[292:31.89]Alright, I'll take a pick of the... I will take a pick of the clown ass.
[292:37.23]I promise.

[292:55.37]Wait, it's just in there?
[292:56.97]It's just in here.
[293:13.60]Wait, where the fuck does this want me to go?
[293:17.71]I can't get in there through here?
[293:19.30]Oh, whatever.

[296:33.17]I'm sorry.
[296:36.47]I gotta settle down.
[296:37.27]I'm like... You sound stressed.
[296:52.40]It's very stressful.
[296:53.44]We don't got much left.
[296:58.26]Now reel it in.
[297:33.61]We're just sitting here.
[297:36.67]Oh, you... Why don't you go... Somebody unhook it.
[297:43.00]Just pull back a little and somebody lift it up.
[297:53.36]Shoot the pilot.
[297:57.31]Shoot... Oh my god.
[298:12.74]Spotlight?
[298:14.66]Shining in his face?
[298:15.48]No.

[298:17.78]Give me the blades.
[298:24.81]Oh, come on.
[298:27.43]Wow.
[298:28.03]All right.
[298:28.31]I don't have any heals.
[298:31.11]Military.
[298:37.38]Military cases.
[298:41.88]That's not a checkpoint.
[298:42.68]I have to do this again.
[298:45.71]I hate this part.
[299:07.80]It's just guaranteed to lose if you get in the middle here.
[299:10.98]Like, it's a guarantee.
[299:25.69]Eat food from the trash?
[299:26.81]No, then I throw up and then I get obliterated.
[300:00.61]They're all dying up there.
[300:02.05]You gotta die down here, man.
[300:14.09]Is there any food here?
[300:14.89]Alright, we're gonna get our puking over with.
[300:32.88]This way, behind the counter.
[300:34.26]Crash!
[300:35.78]Alright, there's lots of food back here, actually.
[300:40.24]Alright, keep the soda.
[300:47.71]Nothing else, right?
[300:51.48]Okay, there's a coffee creamer.
[300:55.09]I don't even need the guns, because they're just a kind of waste of time at this point.
[300:58.35]Because I'm just going to throw shit at them.
[301:01.49]So... Let's move.
[301:05.35]Alright, what if I walk in and walk out of here?
[301:09.96]Will that reset the... If I walk in and walk out?
[301:17.30]That doesn't work?
[301:18.98]Alright, let's go.
[301:28.60]It just fails the mission?
[301:29.51]Damn.
[301:41.53]Military case.
[301:42.66]Comes back!
[301:47.06]Oh my god, he has a lightning gun!
[301:48.56]These are just lasers!
[301:58.53]Fuck!
[302:18.76]I gotta bring these things over.
[302:21.58]Oh my god!
[302:22.46]Please don't lightning gun me!
[302:39.92]It takes too long to pick those up.
[302:42.67]I missed.
[303:00.55]I was gonna say, how dare you.
[303:08.46]The snowball guns aren't gonna do anything.
[303:15.48]Here comes the lightning gun!
[303:17.63]Oh, my eyes are itchy.
[303:29.80]Okay, so military cases of bait.
[303:32.52]There's no reason to pick those up.
[303:36.05]Just pick up the stupid cones.
[303:38.65]And spotlights.
[303:40.19]That's it.
[303:40.83]The military cases of bait.
[303:50.45]That's def.
[303:51.39]That's def.
[303:56.86]How are you alive from that?
[303:58.50]You're alive from that one.
[304:09.49]The military cases have rocket launchers in them?
[304:17.93]Am I being lied to?
[304:18.94]Nice invincibility frames.
[304:31.74]That's dog shit.
[304:35.91]I can't even swing the sword.
[304:36.91]I was just unlocked.
[304:44.67]Oh my goodness.
[304:48.84]I'm just gonna throw plants at you.
[305:07.15]Give me a break.
[305:08.77]Give me a break!
[305:11.63]And he's alive!
[305:13.63]You got hit twice with a katana!
[305:15.99]And you don't even have armor on!
[305:17.15]Hit him right in the fucking head!
[305:21.62]Did he use the snowball gun?
[305:31.68]Okay, I'm gonna do that just so you can see how wrong it is.
[305:59.18]Oh man.
[306:00.72]Oh man, oh man, oh man.
[306:02.56]How did the second swing not hit him?
[306:29.87]You die so fast with the bullets, I know.
[306:31.95]It sucks.
[306:34.43]I'm just gonna stand here.
[306:40.83]I'm stuck in this fucking wall.
[306:54.23]Please get away from me!
[306:59.35]It's a wash.
[307:00.41]It's a wash.
[307:03.19]How did it work the other times?
[307:04.31]I got lucky.
[307:07.99]It's five guys with assault rifles versus the dickhead with the crown on and a katana in his hand.
[307:59.21]I'm not going to kill him with a fucking coffee.
[308:00.53]What are you thinking?
[308:01.15]There's another one.
[308:10.24]What?
[308:17.47]You even know I'm there before you shoot.
[308:19.97]Fuck you.
[308:21.79]Get out of here.
[308:22.53]That's such bullshit.
[308:25.44]If the next person says use the snowball gun...
[308:28.87]Ban him.
[308:29.55]For life.
[308:36.86]Uh, okay.
[308:43.86]I got one shot at this.
[308:44.86]I'm just gonna eat the fries.
[308:51.07]Get full health.
[308:52.99]I'm gonna bring some items with me.
[308:55.55]You know?
[308:55.85]Like, fuck it.
[308:56.55]Drop the snowball gun.
[309:00.48]It works on zombies.
[309:01.82]Put the coffee down.
[309:03.10]Bring a computer.
[309:04.35]Computer case.
[309:05.01]I'm just gonna bring a bunch of keyboards.
[309:08.17]Grab the scissors.
[309:11.31]Grab the computer.
[309:13.71]Okay, can't bring the computer.
[309:15.34]What can I store, like, what can I store, like, in my ass, wherever it is?
[309:19.24]And I'm just gonna throw this shit at him.
[309:23.06]Alright, what about the briefcase?
[309:23.88]Okay, keep the briefcase.
[309:29.41]What is this?
[309:29.85]Domestic magazine.
[309:32.12]Furniture items have much more durability.
[309:33.88]That don't matter.
[309:34.38]Give me the briefcase.
[309:35.96]Okay, I've got a bunch of fucking household items that I'm gonna throw at this guy flying around in a plane.
[309:43.56]Pick up this other suitcase, too.
[309:44.90]Fuck it.
[309:45.20]I don't even care.
[309:45.60]I can make that dumb thing.
[309:46.58]Alright, I've got only household items.
[309:52.92]Frank, that golfer lady, Luz, wants to talk to you back here at the safe house.
[310:04.33]Here we go.
[310:04.57]Fuck.
[310:13.04]I thought he was gonna do the laser.
[310:22.37]Oh my god.
[310:23.67]Fuck you.
[310:33.11]It missed the computer!
[310:40.76]He's gonna fire.
[310:46.86]You've got to be kidding me.
[310:47.70]That was stupid.
[310:48.50]It slowed down to hit me.
[310:50.18]It slowed down to hit me.
[310:52.18]It was aiming slowed down to hit me.
[311:07.42]Alright, here comes the fire!
[311:24.66]He's held the button down longer that time.

[312:48.94]Don't you dare.
[312:51.34]Why did you guys lie to me?
[312:52.56]Why would you lie to me?
[312:54.87]This part is so stressful and why would you lie to me?
[312:58.61]I don't have to do this anymore.
[313:00.45]What's with the lies?
[313:02.11]What's with the lies?
[313:03.09]Alright, household item.
[313:13.20]Suitcases.
[313:15.38]Forget about guns.
[313:16.88]Who cares about guns?
[313:19.66]Small stands and briefcases and computers!
[313:32.68]What else can I grab?
[313:33.42]Okay, how many we got?
[313:38.98]Two briefcases.
[313:39.76]I need this.
[313:40.56]There's another, uh... Where's the other keyboard?
[313:46.92]And bring one soda.
[313:49.07]Where's the other keyboard?
[313:50.81]No, one coffee creamer.
[313:55.20]Okay, get rid of one of the katanas.
[313:57.22]No, keep the katana.
[313:58.78]Get rid of the... Yep, okay.
[314:01.10]The keyboard is right here.
[314:02.08]I have to drop a katana.
[314:06.37]Which one's the one that's going to break?
[314:09.15]No, this will be alright.
[314:09.99]This is fine.
[314:21.56]And a soda.
[314:22.10]I gotta get a soda from here.
[314:27.22]No, not a handgun.
[314:29.18]No, no, no, I got a coffee creamer.
[314:30.24]I'm good.
[314:30.60]Okay, let's try this again.
[314:33.10]I'm just gonna run, but if I run too far away when the lightning gun happens, I get hit by the blades from the rotor.
[315:00.33]Oh, no.
[315:04.05]No, no, no, no, no!
[315:13.45]Who knows the katanas?
[315:14.69]Not the katanas.
[315:16.09]Not the katanas.
[315:18.01]Not anything but the katanas, man.
[315:21.69]Don't do them all.
[315:49.18]It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
[315:53.18]Come.
[316:00.24]What?
[316:05.40]Why am I running in the line of fire?
[316:06.56]Try to run backwards or it takes a turn down and I'll get hit in the face by the helicopter.
[316:24.05]Oh, that sucked.
[316:25.87]And you know what made that suck?
[316:28.43]The fact that I was baited and lied to.
[316:32.01]I was beaten and bruised and brought down to my last second.
[316:35.84]Everyone told me I was going to fail the mission.
[316:37.70]You were beating me down and bruising me.
[316:41.16]But I came back and I persevered.
[316:42.56]I guess ratings must have been down.
[316:51.44]Is he alive?
[316:53.02]He sure is.
[316:54.68]Don't worry, you'll get your interview.
[316:59.49]This bastard better not be heavy.
[317:14.68]What's he doing here?
[317:16.18]Isn't he the host of that show?
[317:20.97]TK paid some pathetic protester to start this whole thing.
[317:25.69]Ratings were down on his show.
[317:28.55]He needed the cash.
[317:30.93]Bastard.
[317:31.43]I love this game.
[317:33.99]I love this game.
[317:34.73]And I hate this game at the same time.
[317:47.08]We're going to be huge.
[317:48.72]He's out cold?
[317:50.50]We ought to make sure he stays that way.
[317:53.48]Don't hit him too hard, Sullivan.
[317:56.26]Why?
[317:57.19]Capital punishment was made for a guy like this.
[318:00.87]That's true love.
[318:01.49]We need this guy to tell the world what he did.
[318:04.65]Don't give a slime ball the easy way out.
[318:12.87]Fine.
[318:13.75]That's the natural feeling, Chief.
[318:16.21]Yeah.
[318:19.92]I do really like it, though.
[318:20.92]I like both these games.
[318:21.88]They're fantastic.
[318:22.86]There's more to this case?
[318:24.20]No, okay.
[318:24.46]The Hail Mary is a football and a grenade.
[318:26.98]Case number seven.
[318:50.97]9 a.m and I got my money back okay so
[319:14.97]I have two Zombricks, so I'm good in that department.
[319:18.15]Here's a computer keyboard.
[319:19.47]I'm going to get rid of it.
[319:20.86]Axe.
[319:22.02]And I need to find a sledgehammer.
[319:27.86]Sledgehammer.
[319:30.88]Wait, there are slots down here?
[319:35.45]That's like a family guy slot machine.
[319:36.93]Okay.
[319:49.23]Are these rigged to lose?
[319:50.01]I don't think these can win.
[320:02.52]I think they're unwinnable.
[320:05.18]That's fine.
[320:05.58]Alright.
[320:07.06]Uh... I don't know who just said that, but... Um... Relax.
[320:13.89]Alright.
[320:16.07]I can do Bentwood Family Feud...
[320:21.41]I also need to deal with the snipers.
[320:28.66]Wait.
[320:30.02]Listen to Luz's proposition.
[320:33.80]The golf pro that I saved.
[320:39.22]Um.
[320:40.48]Yeah, let's do that.
[320:42.57]That sounds interesting.
[320:47.37]I mean, that's just a continuation of her quest line.
[320:50.33]Let's check it out.
[320:57.13]I'm actually in the cafeteria.
[320:57.99]Alright, what's going on here?
[321:06.63]How you doing?
[321:08.49]I lost my favorite club.
[321:09.35]How can I practice for the tour?
[321:10.37]I feel practically naked without it.
[321:13.80]Sorry to hear that.
[321:17.04]Could you fetch a new golf club?
[321:18.42]I spotted some real nice ones in the sports shops.
[321:22.62]I'm not sure I want to risk my neck for a golf club.
[321:24.72]No.
[321:25.92]Fuck!
[321:27.20]I've got some cash tucked away in a surprising... In surprising places, you could get that club.
[321:30.71]I'll give you a real nice reward.
[321:32.05]Okay.
[321:38.99]Uh, golf club.
[321:41.59]Where's a good sporting goods store?
[321:50.70]Clothing...
[321:52.82]travel, sport goods.
[321:58.64]Alright, let's do it.
[322:04.93]Have you tried rolling a seven to craps?
[322:08.77]Uh, I have not.
[322:09.29]I've tried rolling the dice.
[322:14.80]Ah, I feel so happy right now.
[322:17.48]That I don't have to do the fucking machine gun corridor again.
[322:24.98]Sledgehammer?
[322:27.56]Sledgehammer?
[322:28.60]No.
[322:39.00]Sledgehammer?
[322:42.69]No.
[322:44.41]No.
[322:47.49]Sledgehammer?
[322:50.31]I know there's one lying around somewhere.
[322:52.51]Oh, I thought that was it.
[322:53.37]It was a big green one.
[322:54.25]I was like, nice.
[323:01.54]Why are your facecam commands not working?
[323:03.16]Oh, the bot must be messed up or something.
[323:05.02]Sorry.
[323:20.39]Where's the hammer?
[323:26.31]Oh, yeah.
[323:27.47]Oh, yeah.

[324:39.97]I have the combo card for it, right?
[324:41.23]So that means it's better.
[324:41.87]It's not just shitty?
[324:50.76]Yeah, I get more PP for it.
[324:52.22]Yeah, that's cool.
[324:52.84]Alright, let's get a golf club.

[326:04.18]And I get to keep the club?
[326:06.43]No, I don't get to keep the club.
[326:07.65]Hold on, do it again.
[326:24.72]Just steal it.
[326:28.26]Who needs gambling when you can just golf?
[326:36.92]10 Grim.
[326:38.94]And a PP bonus.
[326:40.90]Oh, this is going to be very, very hard.
[326:45.05]That's in there.
[326:48.81]Bet your ass it is.
[326:56.91]Just barely short.
[326:57.65]I just need one more.
[326:58.27]Oh!
[327:05.00]Too early.
[327:07.28]I got one.
[327:12.95]Oh, I did it.
[327:13.33]I actually just... Leave me alone.
[327:15.75]There's a golf club right here.
[327:21.12]Golf club.
[327:25.36]Alright.
[327:29.34]Bent wood!
[327:31.90]Bring it back.
[327:33.91]Cool.
[327:34.09]Cool.
[327:36.69]Don't break the pool.
[327:40.93]He was only watching?
[327:41.79]Well, leave me alone.
[327:45.47]Why would you just be standing breathing on me?
[327:55.62]Your breath stinks.
[327:59.40]Run with the football.
[328:04.36]Go long!
[328:08.22]Alright, now pick it up.
[328:09.24]And pretend that you catch it.
[328:15.55]Why am I getting minus twos for this?
[328:17.05]I'm just, I'm fulfilling a chat request.
[328:29.56]He did it for the fans.
[328:30.88]I did it for the fans.
[328:35.24]Now what's, what's going on here?
[328:36.60]Here, I brought you something.
[328:39.01]Thanks, Frank.
[328:39.47]Now I can get to practice.
[328:40.25]I need to make those other girls on the tour feel my wrath.
[328:43.43]Okay, um... Easy.
[328:47.15]And what do I get for this?
[328:49.54]5,000 and... A new skill.
[328:53.00]60,000 P. That's a lot.
[328:56.54]Now what do you need?
[328:59.10]Between zombies and the military, there's, like, a terrible danger.
[329:01.42]Have we not found clothes for you?
[329:09.03]We have to, like, save the Fortuna Asvid... It's a small plant that only grows in the Fortune City, but... Don't you know anything?
[329:22.35]I know a local artist that used it in his pieces.
[329:24.13]I'm sure it's at the Clairol Collection in the Palisades Mall.
[329:27.34]I came here to get it and plant it to make sure that this is the wonderful piece of flora it lives on.
[329:32.50]Not sure if I would risk my life for a plant.
[329:34.36]Maybe I will.
[329:37.85]You wouldn't risk our ecosystem.
[329:39.31]Okay.
[329:48.07]Green plant used in peace art.
[329:49.71]I saw some in the chloro collection.
[329:53.69]All right.
[329:55.94]I won't be doing that one.
[329:57.16]World's most dangerous trick.
[330:01.22]Investigate the stage.
[330:02.36]It looks like someone's performing tricks by the stage in the Atlantica Casino.
[330:08.26]This is the botany thing.
[330:11.44]Help the girl on the roof.
[330:13.10]Family feud.
[330:14.97]We'll do this trick one first.
[330:22.85]Let me save it.
[330:24.57]We want tricks.
[330:25.23]We want tricks.
[330:25.93]I'm gonna give it to you.
[330:28.28]Don't worry.
[330:28.58]You want tricks?
[330:29.36]I'm gonna give it to you.
[330:36.91]Good answer, good answer, good answer.
[330:39.47]Get over there.
[331:09.58]15 minutes of face cam.
[331:10.67]Rage.
[331:11.09]15 minutes of face cam.
[331:12.85]Rage face.
[331:14.75]Where's my 15 minutes of face cam?
[331:17.65]Rage.
[331:28.79]Where is my face cam?
[331:33.54]I'm only here for one reason and one reason only.
[331:38.47]It's to see your face on camera.
[331:44.58]And that's it.
[331:45.86]There's no other reason why I'm here.
[331:47.94]Now get it on there.
[331:51.54]Okay, god damn it.
[331:57.29]Just slow down.
[332:03.73]There we go.
[332:07.13]Okay, I'm not gonna keep going with that one.
[332:15.11]That's not a good one to do.
[332:16.11]Alright, wait... Where are the most dangerous tricks?
[332:19.79]Let me save the game.
[332:21.88]Ah, snipers are out here.
[332:22.82]Fuck.
[332:28.24]That would hurt way more, I think, than a knife.
[332:32.68]I don't know why, I just think the keyboard to the head is worse, somehow.
[332:40.62]Where are the snipers?
[332:43.19]They're like right here somewhere.
[332:44.23]Okay, hold on.
[332:47.43]Can I get in there without dying?
[332:48.83]A plastic keyboard?
[332:53.01]Well, some of these keyboards weigh like fucking 25 pounds.
[332:54.85]What do you mean no?
[333:04.74]What do you mean no?
[333:07.53]What do you mean no?
[333:09.90]Chat.
[333:11.24]Chat.
[333:13.36]We're gonna have a little fight here, chat.
[333:24.06]Chat.
[333:24.66]Do you guys like being referred to as chat?
[333:34.14]Now listen, chat, chat, chat, chat.
[333:40.57]See you.
[333:49.52]What did I drop for this?
[333:53.78]Uh, the Rake is the best weapon in the game.
[333:55.34]Why did I not have this?
[334:00.07]Jerm, I'm laughing too loudly.
[334:01.49]It's 3 AM.
[334:02.21]Stop being so funny.
[334:06.31]I'm gonna get you in trouble.
[334:08.41]It's my job for the rest of the stream to get you in trouble.
[334:19.87]I still haven't even picked up a treasure chest.
[334:21.35]What am I thinking?
[334:24.87]Okay, that person's dead.
[334:25.95]So, you're trying to tell me that's not as bad as getting stabbed?
[334:31.09]That was like a Corsair vengeance!
[334:35.10]I want to open the chest.
[334:42.98]What's in it?
[334:44.27]A hundred dollars.
[334:45.15]What a waste.
[334:46.91]Alright, did I save the game like I was trying to?
[334:54.67]Chat?
[334:56.90]What?
[335:18.35]Stupid.
[335:19.37]This guy gets it.
[335:19.85]I'm just surrounded by idiots.
[335:22.13]Imbeciles all around me.
[335:47.04]We have a volunteer!
[335:47.82]A lovely lady, perhaps?
[335:55.66]We have a volunteer!
[335:59.18]I said this before during, like, this is a callback.
[336:02.48]Are you guys paying attention?
[336:04.38]Chat.
[336:05.54]Sawing the lady in half!
[336:15.08]I didn't have a chance to stop that.
[336:24.03]Damn it.
[336:24.95]Not again.
[336:26.19]What the hell?
[336:27.37]That's not magic.
[336:28.41]Oh, look at Mr. Big Guy here.
[336:44.39]I do, actually.
[336:49.50]So there's two people that are in either side.
[336:53.02]One of them is contorting their body, lying down flat, where the feet come out.
[336:59.90]The bottom part... I'm going to ruin this for you guys.
[337:02.59]What?
[337:02.75]You don't want me to tell you?
[337:03.37]Oh.
[337:09.64]The feet are lying down on a lower platform.
[337:13.52]So when it pulls apart, they're actually underneath, lying down, curled up.
[337:16.88]And they stick their feet out.
[337:17.77]And it's two people.
[337:18.63]Got it.
[337:43.68]What is this music?
[337:45.68]This guy's hiding.
[337:52.65]Fuck.
[337:52.77]I don't want to get hit by that.
[338:14.92]He's just running away.
[338:15.54]Alright, hold on.
[338:19.58]Watch the back.
[338:20.93]He's coming around the back.
[338:28.93]Damn it!
[338:31.81]Oh shit!
[338:33.03]Oh shit!
[338:33.67]Oh my god!
[338:35.05]Oh my god!
[338:36.88]Oh my god!
[338:47.81]I need food!
[338:52.88]Food, something.
[338:53.52]Food, something to eat.
[338:54.28]Anything to eat.
[338:54.84]Anybody got some food around here?
[339:04.36]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[339:07.80]On the boat!
[339:13.50]There's gonna be beer on the boat, right?
[339:14.80]It's like... Can I eat this?
[339:19.68]I can't eat the swordfish?
[339:26.32]Shit.
[339:28.64]In here.
[339:36.12]Where is it?
[339:36.48]Where's the beer?
[339:36.96]Where's the beer?
[339:41.90]Is it coffee creamers?
[339:45.33]And a gun.
[339:49.70]Get that cocktail.
[339:51.20]Okay.
[339:51.85]There's shitloads of beer in here.
[339:59.67]I'm going to replace the rake.
[340:07.93]I'm going to replace the... That's good.
[340:11.63]No, that's good.
[340:12.83]That's good for now.
[340:13.47]I can come back in here.
[340:14.29]Get the gun out here.
[340:24.64]Where'd they go?
[340:35.16]I'm part of the song.
[340:43.35]Roger.
[340:50.25]Fuck.
[341:01.41]Get shot.
[341:07.43]Wow, this is ultimate.
[341:09.51]I'm so glad I didn't get hit by that.
[341:10.59]Pick up the gun.
[341:12.83]What are you doing, man?
[341:27.29]Alright, that's fine.
[341:31.55]Any more guns?
[341:36.17]Where's, uh... Where's... What's his name?
[341:37.60]Roger.
[341:37.84]There he is.
[341:38.20]Let's go.
[341:42.34]Bye.
[341:43.56]Punk.
[341:54.04]Just the ranged one.
[341:57.66]Where is he now?
[342:06.02]Anybody see him?
[342:06.54]Where'd he go?
[342:17.61]Is he in here?
[342:18.31]He's behind.
[342:23.75]There he is.
[342:26.35]Alright.
[342:27.25]Don't get shot point-blank.
[342:37.37]Drink.
[342:51.26]Don't fire that gun!
[343:10.55]Oh, fuck.
[343:12.05]I'm just gonna have to go back here and drink.
[343:22.95]Fire over here.
[343:23.87]Shit.
[343:38.65]He just dodged that by doing a bow.
[343:40.49]Wait for the puke.
[343:58.31]Wait for the puke.
[343:59.33]It's gonna happen again.
[343:59.93]Okay, let's get in.
[344:17.65]No, he just cast a spell on me.
[344:25.78]That does a lot of damage.
[344:26.96]Don't get cocky.
[344:28.45]Oh my god, just get another drink.
[344:58.07]Just hit him one more time.
[344:59.13]Just hit him one more time.
[345:05.66]I can't take the photo?
[345:08.90]Oh, fuck.
[345:09.36]That was intense.
[345:34.92]That made me laugh so hard.
[345:38.16]Somebody said, you're gonna be shitting blood.
[345:40.64]Why?
[345:41.24]Because I'm drinking?
[345:42.36]Like a bunch of cocktails?
[345:55.02]It was four beers.
[345:57.02]Okay, I can make a rocket launcher now.
[346:00.28]Pretty decent PP.
[346:01.62]Let's see if we can get a... Should we get like a photo of this?
[346:22.14]Magician's sword.
[346:23.07]Cool.
[346:25.39]And a rocket launcher.
[346:29.93]Oh boy.
[346:31.75]This looks like it's gonna be fun.
[346:43.60]Okay, now I can pick up the stuff on the table that I want to pick up.
[346:56.90]Alright, where's the feud?
[347:00.82]Oh, shit.
[347:01.40]Oh, no.
[347:01.70]He's shitting blood.
[347:08.87]I can take one more heal.
[347:13.22]No, I can't.
[347:15.30]Let's go.
[347:16.50]Alright, where's the feud?
[347:18.80]Family feud is... Uh, how far away?
[347:24.04]Is that family feud?
[347:25.26]Where's the actual case?
[347:26.18]Back at the... Rescue should be arriving soon.
[347:31.18]When the time comes, the Royal Flush rooftop should be great to capture all the military action.
[347:37.16]So, I've got not that long to get into there.
[347:40.54]But that's when it starts.
[347:45.14]See if I can get into Family Feud.
[347:47.88]Okay.
[347:48.82]And let's go.
[347:49.38]See if I can get there.
[347:51.84]Yeah, you need to be there for that when the time goes down.
[348:04.05]I need a save point.
[348:05.94]Actually, there's a save point right here.
[348:10.26]The snipers are still up there, right?
[348:19.60]Can I get across?
[348:23.28]I wonder if I can get across.
[348:27.39]Blast him with the rockets.
[348:29.73]Where do I end up here?
[348:31.29]I think... I should... As long as I stay... I... Okay, I'm gonna hug the wall here.
[348:44.07]If I get shot once... Oh, I need to take Zombrex.
[348:50.92]Sorry.
[348:51.54]As long as I don't get in the open.
[348:57.16]Oh my god, this is... I didn't know that was gonna happen.
[349:04.33]That's a lot of PP.
[349:07.43]Uh, yeah.
[349:22.46]Don't let that go to waste.
[349:25.04]Move.
[349:36.40]Move.
[349:37.00]Okay.
[349:38.02]I made it.
[349:43.98]Just unload?

[351:09.07]If this is hard, this is all going off the roof.
[351:14.73]Why didn't I listen to her?
[351:19.61]Don't shoot me.
[351:20.17]I can help you.
[351:24.06]I'm looking for my mother.
[351:24.96]Alright, we gotta find the mother.
[351:33.15]Did you see where she went?
[351:36.89]The food court.
[351:37.81]Alright, well we gotta go.
[351:44.15]Stay here and take your finger off the trigger.
[351:45.58]If she's alive, I'll find her.
[351:49.80]Okay, goodbye.
[351:52.22]Headed to the food court.
[352:01.81]I gotta get up to that roof.
[352:08.37]That's when it starts.
[352:09.75]I wonder if I can get up.
[352:10.79]Can I do this?
[352:12.21]I hope so.
[352:43.61]Man, I love this game.
[352:45.19]I know.
[352:46.67]It's very good.
[352:47.29]Alright, food court.
[352:52.58]That's pretty damn far away.
[352:54.32]I'm going to have to lose the rocket launcher and get in the car.
[352:58.04]Okay.
[353:16.82]I gotta get my use out of this thing.
[353:18.04]I'm almost level 27.
[353:26.83]Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it.
[353:37.05]Let's get a blow up on me!
[353:48.08]Let's go!
[354:00.99]This thing is really slow.
[354:10.15]Okay, but I can... Where are the snipers?
[354:20.84]If I just get her in the car.
[354:24.32]Wait, what's going on?
[354:25.06]She's in here?
[354:38.77]The snipers are gone.
[354:39.55]Okay, thank you for telling me.
[354:43.51]I don't have time.
[354:44.10]I have to go to the K7.
[354:45.72]I'm sorry, Grandma.
[354:46.44]You're dead.
[354:55.12]That's just the way it is.
[354:55.74]9 AM.
[354:57.48]I mean, that's the way it is.
[355:06.19]Sorry.
[355:08.03]But I have to get over there, and I have to bring her all the way back, and that's just not gonna fucking happen.
[355:22.76]Hold on.
[355:54.05]It's been a while since I've saved the damn game.
[355:59.68]That evil... It's a zombie.
[356:07.57]See?
[356:09.21]She's in another plane now.
[356:26.35]I'm in time.
[356:26.89]I'm not gonna let this go to shit again.
[356:49.24]What?
[356:50.80]Oh, it's the roof, right.
[356:54.64]Free soda?
[356:55.20]I'll take it.
[356:57.41]And a hot dog.
[357:02.05]Okay, I don't need it yet.
[357:04.87]But, oh.
[357:07.45]Hold on just a second here.
[357:09.75]Where's my football?
[357:11.83]Shit.
[357:14.87]Wait, can I do... Wait.
[357:19.83]No, what is it?
[357:22.57]It's a lead pipe and what is it?
[357:27.61]Fireworks.
[357:29.43]Fuck.
[357:30.15]Right.
[357:36.55]Stay right there.
[357:37.03]I'm gonna go get fireworks.
[357:37.80]I think this is the end of some right here.
[357:47.62]I got my weapon back.
[357:50.08]Only 75, though.
[357:53.49]Is it in the same weapon?
[357:55.93]I think it is.
[357:57.46]Alright.
[357:58.58]Rooftop.
[358:00.06]Let's go.
[358:00.50]I am ready.
[358:12.73]I have dynamite.
[358:14.57]I have one bottle of whiskey.
[358:17.49]Any food?
[358:17.97]There's bacon here, but the bacon sucks.
[358:19.37]It heals like one or two.
[358:35.73]Just testing it.
[358:37.61]Pick it up so I don't lose it in the cutscene.
[358:44.18]Follow the arrows.
[358:47.02]Uh... What are you doing?
[358:50.44]The arrow's here.
[358:53.42]Follow the arrows, dude.
[358:54.70]What are you doing?
[358:58.70]Wasting time.
[358:59.40]I have like 12... I have like less than 15, 17, 16 whatever minutes.
[359:04.05]I ain't going anywhere.
[359:07.67]Make the machete copper.
[359:11.39]I ain't going anywhere.
[359:17.19]Could have saved mom.
[359:20.31]No.
[359:20.95]Because I would have had to put mom in the wheelchair.
[359:24.11]And here's what would have happened.
[359:26.07]Come on, come on, please!
[359:27.47]Please!
[359:30.25]Wait, no, no, get in, get in, get in!
[359:31.27]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[359:32.09]How much time?
[359:33.38]I would have brought her back.
[359:34.04]It would have happened like 12 times in a row.
[359:36.40]I'm relaxing right now.
[359:38.14]Just chilling.
[359:40.24]And then I would have got her back.
[359:43.27]Completed.
[359:43.95]Oh, thank God.
[359:44.97]Wait.
[359:45.81]Look at 7-1.
[359:46.45]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[359:48.53]I got to run.
[359:49.23]Get me back.
[359:49.71]Wait.
[359:49.93]No.
[359:50.33]What the fuck was I thinking?
[359:51.47]Why did I do this?
[359:55.23]I'm secure.
[359:59.72]And I ain't going anywhere.
[360:02.81]Think of all that stress that is, yeah, that's not here right now.
[360:05.84]It's just me, and you, and K7.1.
[360:18.12]Just think of the amount of, oh my fucking gods, that you're not gonna hear.
[360:25.61]I'm doing this for you.
[360:51.39]They're actually called goons.
[360:53.91]No, this is now military.
[360:55.34]So now do we have goons and military or no?
[361:08.27]This is the guy from the first game that I spit on.
[361:10.85]Are you sure?
[361:40.95]We didn't take the lens cap off, Rebecca.
[362:00.50]How are we ever gonna prove this all in court?
[362:24.33]Wait, does it gas now?
[362:32.39]Oh no, it's going to get special infected now.
[362:46.12]This is bad, this is not going to be good.
[363:06.30]Look out!
[363:08.02]This is the gremlin that drank the vegetable potion in Gremlins 2.
[363:49.08]Why is he not... You feel like a hero?
[364:08.41]Rebecca, what are you doing down there?
[364:21.57]Oh my god.
[364:22.51]Okay.
[364:28.37]K-7 to K-7 to engaged.
[364:32.17]Let's go.
[364:33.31]Military rescue backfired.
[364:34.59]Now Rebecca's in danger out there.
[364:37.09]Save it.
[364:39.50]Oh, here comes an... Oh my fucking god.
[364:42.74]Jesus.
[364:43.44]Jesus.
[364:50.21]Do you think so?
[364:52.70]I don't think so.
[364:54.96]Time until fire bomb.
[365:00.71]I actually have a lot of time to do this.
[365:02.81]Family feud?
[365:03.53]Let's go.
[365:17.40]Oh, fuck.
[365:20.50]Where is Rebecca?
[365:26.45]I could do it, but barely.
[365:27.45]Not even hard.
[365:41.48]Just carry around this thing.
[365:48.06]Where am I going?
[365:49.72]Back in here.
[365:57.32]Is the whole thing gas?
[365:59.04]Everything is gas.
[365:59.90]Nothing happens if I touch it.
[366:11.25]I missed the...
[366:20.12]Ah, why would you dodge roll?
[366:25.19]I lost my fire.
[366:25.97]I lost my crutch.
[366:28.03]No, I didn't.
[366:34.37]Is this fucking thing gonna detonate?
[366:40.62]Um, excuse me.
[366:42.36]Ex- Excuse me, game?
[366:44.74]Excuse me?
[366:45.44]It's spinning like crazy.
[367:00.66]Oh my fucking god.
[367:02.60]I have to wiggle the stick.
[367:15.23]I did it again.
[367:21.17]I did the same thing I did last time.
[367:26.25]Just... Just run.
[367:32.42]Have I been spinning it this whole time?
[367:34.06]No, I was wiggling it all over the place.
[367:37.99]I was going left-right-left-right-left-right-left-right-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-left-
[368:04.15]Actually, I saw your daughter on the hotel rooftop and she's got a gun.
[368:07.07]I'm worried she might do something, but I can take you there.
[368:11.15]She was always such a tomboy.
[368:12.42]Never did play with dolls.
[368:13.66]Please.

[368:18.76]If I have to carry you, just be aware that I'm not doing that.
[368:27.96]You've got a weapon?
[368:29.57]Do I have to carry you?
[368:37.10]What is going on?

[372:29.60]Epic.
[372:37.25]That was really close.
[372:40.48]It was also made closer by the fact that when I was about to take the photo, I right-triggered and left-triggered and almost shot them with the rocket launcher.
[372:50.01]It was... That almost happened.
[372:51.47]And I'm very glad it didn't.

[377:15.98]Nobody touch anything.
[377:28.54]Ladies, don't be scared.
[377:29.34]Oh, finally, a clerk.
[377:30.81]I came here to get my grandbaby a present.
[377:32.87]But on my way, all these young hooligans kept fighting me.
[377:36.21]Then when I enter here, no one comes to help me.
[377:38.37]For shame.
[377:41.39]Don't think I won't tell your manager, young man.
[377:45.43]Lady, there are zombies everywhere.
[377:46.39]I have to get you out of here now.
[377:49.02]That's a real boomer.
[377:49.82]That's right.
[377:50.18]I need to... I'm gonna die.
[377:56.90]I have one hit and I'm dead.
[378:03.22]Catch more flies with this, okay.
[378:07.08]Lady, wee.
[378:09.18]Tut tut, young man, what did I just say about flies and honey?
[378:20.53]The zombies are not toys, they're real zombies.
[378:24.25]There has been an accident.
[378:25.99]Camille is like, oh, there's somebody over here.
[378:33.66]Nice.
[378:35.92]You young people constantly dilly-dallying when something important is going on.
[378:40.76]Mm-hmm.
[378:48.94]I'm a little too old to hurry.
[378:49.94]My bunions keep... You really are.
[378:59.55]And I have to carry her.
[379:01.79]And no health either.
[379:05.11]Zero.
[379:15.20]Oh my god, there's orange juice in the back.
[379:17.88]Are you serious?
[379:25.68]Any more food?
[379:28.34]Oh my fucking... crap.
[379:41.62]Lillian's screaming downstairs.
[379:43.54]Onion rings.
[379:46.05]Alright.
[379:48.15]Shh.
[379:48.95]Shh.
[379:50.91]Relax.
[379:57.50]Okay.
[379:57.78]Come here.
[380:15.54]Mask on the shelves.
[380:28.17]Here we go.
[380:28.79]Move it or lose it.
[380:31.19]I gotta get down the stairs.
[380:34.45]Meet up with Lillian.
[380:36.59]We're going for it.
[380:37.85]We're going for it.
[380:40.38]I can't.
[380:40.98]I can't go for it.
[380:41.60]I can't go for it.
[380:42.16]I was gonna jump down the stairs.
[380:49.91]Wait, I, I, I, I, I, we're already, we're already there?
[380:53.95]I hate carrying people.
[381:07.52]Okay, go down.
[381:12.66]All right, everything's good.
[381:15.87]Follow me.
[381:20.37]Oh my god, I just ate so much damage.
[381:22.21]What happened to my head?
[381:28.59]Didn't I have a cool helmet on?
[381:37.86]Lillian's gonna die.
[381:40.36]Maybe she'll shake it off.
[381:41.12]She has a weapon.
[381:43.58]Come on, Lillian.
[381:44.22]You can do it.
[381:44.94]Lillian, break out.
[381:46.02]Lillian, you can do it.
[381:49.48]You gotta be kidding me.
[381:56.02]This fucking old bitch just ruined everything.
[381:59.72]And you weren't even-
[382:22.14]I'm so disappointed.
[382:23.12]I don't even think I have a checkpoint.
[382:26.52]Just 98 years old?
[382:33.31]No, you're not.
[382:46.57]When was it?
[382:47.57]It's too late.
[382:48.47]When am I going to reload it?
[382:52.97]Reload it and just leave her?
[383:00.14]Should I just reload it?
[383:01.62]How far away was it?
[383:02.50]Does anybody remember?
[383:07.82]Did I have them all together?
[383:09.18]It's not that far?
[383:12.24]Let me see.
[383:15.33]It was pretty close.
[383:16.39]It's not far.
[383:18.11]Let's do it.
[383:20.15]Which one of these was it?
[383:22.21]It was... 8-11-10-40 AM.
[383:33.57]I think it was, yeah, this one.
[383:34.89]It has to be this one.
[383:39.84]He sounds so defeated.
[383:40.86]He sounds very German Pluto.
[383:43.50]Alright, so I have...
[383:47.09]Okay.
[383:56.65]I don't give a shit about the old lady.
[383:58.65]We're bringing the original two back.
[384:02.81]It's a waste of time.
[384:14.56]But what about the orange juice?
[384:24.96]I can't wait till they're in range.
[384:27.97]What about the orange juice?
[384:40.05]I'll just clear a path.
[385:05.55]You here?
[385:08.43]Stay with me, Lillian.
[385:09.45]Stay with me.
[385:18.14]She's really far away.
[385:19.86]Oh, come on!
[385:20.52]I'm trying to look and see where she is!
[385:22.64]They don't give you a moment's rest!
[385:26.02]There's not a moment's time!
[385:30.06]I can't even look over my shoulder!
[385:54.02]Oh, right, I had the checkpoint because I came in this door.
[386:00.40]Whatever, I'm not gonna take a hit right here.
[386:06.99]Okay, now I got a good checkpoint.
[386:08.03]If they both make it in, if not, then that's very, very, very good.
[386:13.85]Let's try this again.
[386:18.69]Let's go get in.
[386:22.37]Alright, come this way.
[386:28.76]I'm just gonna make sure she gets over here.
[386:39.04]I mean, this is not a bad strategy.
[386:40.42]Am I going the wrong way?
[386:44.22]No, it's good I didn't change the... okay.
[386:47.99]I am going the wrong way.
[386:49.47]No, I'm not.
[386:52.07]The GPS sucks.
[387:10.66]Stay with me, Lillian.
[387:12.74]Stay with me.
[387:18.73]Stay with me.
[387:22.63]Alright.
[387:23.99]The same fucking person.
[387:25.73]It's like, it's, it's, it's bullshit.
[387:30.91]Lillian, you good?
[387:32.61]Good.
[387:41.59]Alright.
[387:45.88]Two is better than one.
[387:46.62]I don't care about Grandma.
[387:48.02]It's like a carrying people around.
[387:50.46]Don't lose it now.
[388:10.53]No, I don't want to carry.
[388:12.15]You know what I wish you could do in this game?
[388:14.21]I wish if I brought somebody up there that was able-bodied, that they could carry them.
[388:23.52]You deserve a reward.
[388:25.72]Combo card?
[388:30.65]Go carry Granny to the car right now and then drive.
[388:36.76]Let me save it.
[388:37.82]What's the card?
[388:39.64]Defib and Medical Tray.
[388:43.70]Go get Granny!
[388:44.46]Alright.
[388:47.58]I will attempt it once.
[388:52.35]Thank God for the inventory increase.
[388:53.57]Yeah, that's really good.
[389:07.02]Short-sighted.
[389:07.70]Let's go get her.
[389:18.33]My good weapon's almost done.
[389:19.91]Nice dodge.
[389:26.56]Here comes the grab.
[389:27.52]Here comes the grab.
[389:38.51]Alright.
[389:40.53]Get the car.
[389:41.71]I'm gonna bring the car.
[389:49.44]Go get the car.
[389:51.22]That's funny.
[389:51.80]I'm losing my mind.
[389:53.74]Okay.
[389:54.60]Get the car.
[390:05.13]car and then put grammy grammy in the car 98 is not a boomer no 98 what is what was before boomer that's like red dead redemption
[390:33.61]It's like 1901.
[390:37.41]Those aren't boomers.
[390:41.01]Those look like Wild West.
[390:43.99]Alright, Randy, let's go.
[390:46.82]I'm here for you.
[390:57.14]This thing... How do you drive this car?
[391:01.16]Seriously.
[391:11.09]That thing is on ice gates.
[391:23.20]Hello?
[391:25.60]Don't be scared.
[391:26.42]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[391:27.24]Skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.
[391:46.67]Hurry up, Esther.
[391:47.77]You hundred-year-old... dustbag.
[391:56.70]Alright, cheers.
[392:19.71]Let's get in the car.
[392:20.61]Let's get the hell out of here.
[392:31.68]Oh my god, don't die.
[392:32.70]There's a lot of people in there.
[392:33.86]I gotta go the other way.
[392:35.46]Oh, fuck.
[392:37.69]They're too fast, they're too fast, they're too fast.
[392:54.10]Alright Granny, let's go!
[393:11.35]I feel like I'm not driving the car!
[393:18.87]What is this driving?
[393:54.41]Thank you, Conadman.
[393:55.70]Yes.
[393:56.46]You're very welcome, Granny.
[394:02.54]30,000 P. That leaves me with nothing else to do.
[394:06.76]Except to go get to level 29.
[394:10.35]Enjoy the next two days of your 98-year-long life.
[394:21.63]Yeah.
[394:25.26]Go right to the next case.
[394:26.96]What about Zombrex?
[394:27.82]I feel like I need more.
[394:31.66]Next case, just immediately, let's go.
[394:38.23]That was a good one.
[394:41.83]Some of you guys are funny.
[394:43.39]Very funny.
[394:52.86]Yeah, because case 7, this is going to last a long time.
[395:02.35]I still have some decent weapons.
[395:03.40]I wish I had a... Damn.
[395:09.37]I guess I could make another one of these.
[395:30.62]Not creative.
[395:32.94]I'm not trying to be creative.
[395:33.96]I'm trying to win.
[395:38.60]Is the sledgehammer in here?
[395:44.51]Yeah, but I know there's a sledgehammer in here.
[395:46.09]But yeah, I know.
[395:47.29]And I'm going to get another axe.
[395:49.57]I'll grab an axe.
[395:53.01]And I'll make another one of these once I find another axe.
[395:58.83]What is this?
[396:16.88]Doesn't look bad.
[396:26.35]Yell if you see an axe.
[396:27.37]Because I need it.
[396:36.43]I have a lot of money, too.
[396:37.42]I could buy Zombrex if I needed to.
[396:39.78]I got one in my hand.
[396:46.28]Oh, I got one in my hand, but... I'm talking about a regular axe.
[396:54.43]Get out of the way.
[397:07.33]No, no, no.
[397:08.25]It's gonna be this all over again.
[397:09.97]Through the maintenance tunnel.
[397:18.78]Maybe an axe?
[397:21.10]There's a spear.
[397:23.36]Machete and... Oh.
[397:28.06]Ah.
[397:28.82]I got a little bit of time.
[397:33.22]Handgun, drill, and spear.
[397:40.71]Does it work?
[397:42.85]Oh, damn.
[397:49.21]The Driller?
[397:55.14]That's actually kind of cool.
[397:56.16]Okay.
[397:58.84]I'm going to drop... I'm going to leave the Defiler because it's done.
[398:01.84]It's toast anyways.
[398:06.24]Broom and Gun.
[398:08.16]Let's try it.
[398:15.34]You're holding a brick.
[398:19.05]Yeah?
[398:20.01]What's the point?
[398:21.43]That's important.
[398:25.69]That didn't work.
[398:26.31]Alright.
[398:29.03]Fine.
[398:30.33]Fine.
[398:30.61]Let's go.
[398:30.99]Fine.
[398:31.29]Okay.
[398:44.03]broom machete.
[398:47.17]I'm running out of time.
[398:48.15]I'm going to get inside of this.
[398:51.71]There's a bow.
[398:53.58]Kind of cool, but who cares.
[399:00.82]I got the Zombrex that was over here already.
[399:21.44]I kind of wish I had the motorcycle.
[399:22.68]This is pretty slow.
[399:35.57]Jump.
[399:35.89]Let's do it.
[399:39.55]Are you kidding me?
[399:44.65]I thought it was over.
[399:46.47]Nope.
[399:51.26]Now it is.
[399:54.28]Come on, that sucks.
[399:56.51]That sucks.
[399:57.05]Give me this other one.
[400:05.77]Come on.
[400:22.20]Move.
[400:31.32]Doing well.
[400:34.84]Lost a little bit of health, but... What can you do?
[400:39.38]There might be food right here.
[400:41.82]Tires?
[400:42.40]What is that?
[400:50.44]That's a shotgun.
[400:59.69]I don't think I've been in this maintenance room.
[401:03.03]Another shotgun.
[401:04.13]You can combine the shotgun with something?
[401:09.13]What can I combine with a shotgun?
[401:11.37]Shotgun and... I don't know.
[401:15.77]I gotta look at my cards.
[401:17.07]Shotgun and shotgun.
[401:17.96]Does that work?
[401:20.70]Shotgun and battery?
[401:22.88]No way.
[401:29.28]No, that doesn't do anything.
[401:31.67]Shotgun and shotgun.
[401:54.30]Why did I come in here?
[402:06.78]It is never going to stop coming in.
[402:07.86]Alright, give me my... Oh my goodness.
[402:15.32]Alright, so... Forget it.
[402:24.61]Just... Goodbye.
[402:27.23]No reason to do any of this.
[402:28.55]Shotgun and the lawnmower?
[402:45.21]Let's see.
[402:47.94]Pole Weapon, Air Horn, Weed Tenderizer, Ripper, Pegasus, Sticky Bomb.
[402:56.98]I don't have any of that.
[402:59.20]Hellblade, Defiler, I know that.
[403:02.19]Battery and Sledgehammer.
[403:03.67]Okay, I can do that.
[403:08.43]Money Hacker is a flashlight and a computer.
[403:11.13]Knife Gloves, right?
[403:13.89]That's a laser sword, snowball cannon, spike bat, right?
[403:16.30]Alright, well I'll make the shotgun and battery.
[403:22.54]Battery and lawnmower.
[403:23.76]Let me try this.
[403:28.08]It looks pretty good.
[403:29.26]Can I hold it and... I have to... Okay, I can have it in my inventory.
[403:32.78]That's pretty huge.
[403:35.14]How's it work?
[403:41.63]I mean, it's slow as shit.
[403:52.20]Well, I'm dead.
[404:04.47]I lost that much health because I went into the maintenance room.
[404:08.31]And the whole game flooded in.
[404:10.02]It's just... You have a magnet.
[404:12.14]They just want to eat you.
[404:13.18]You just... Fresh meat or whatever.
[404:16.26]And now I have to do that again.
[404:22.92]and they didn't close the door.
[404:24.04]I was surrounded by people coughing in my face.
[404:26.74]They were just sneezing on me and stunning me.
[404:40.44]Just like in real life.
[404:42.79]And that happened.
[404:43.41]Remember when that happened?
[404:44.27]We're just going to redo the same scenario.
[404:46.57]I don't play games differently the second time through.
[404:48.79]We just do it the same way every time.
[404:51.87]That's just the way it happens.
[404:55.25]But, wait a second.
[404:59.97]There's a tennis ball launcher?
[405:01.69]Ugh, tennis ball launcher and the blades.
[405:05.41]I mean, obviously.
[405:15.82]tennis ball launcher how do I use it can I pick it up
[405:46.37]No, there's no point with this!
[405:47.47]There's no point.
[405:48.63]There's no point.
[405:49.47]I can't even bring it with me.
[406:15.53]That would have been really useful, yeah.
[406:16.77]Okay, do not have the same scenario play out twice.
[406:28.22]I know, they call me Jeremy... do it again... Elbertson.
[406:36.80]Nothing changes.
[406:38.00]They call me German, nothing fucking changes Elbertson.
[406:40.44]Because I do the same mistakes every time.
[407:00.59]Okay, battery, sledgehammer.
[407:08.34]Done.
[407:09.34]Now, we've got... That's pretty much what I had with before.
[407:12.27]I'm gonna pick the other shotgun.
[407:14.45]Remember this?
[407:42.80]That went real far.
[407:48.90]I saw the hot dogs.
[407:51.66]No, I need that crusher.
[408:04.42]Fuck the snack.
[408:05.55]It's only one bar anyways.
[408:06.63]Let's go.
[408:09.47]Axe.
[408:09.71]I used the Sledgehammer already.
[408:15.51]Axe and Sledge... You know what?
[408:23.28]Just get rid of this.
[408:25.80]It doesn't do anything for me.
[408:27.34]It takes so long to detonate.
[408:34.43]Look at the axe.
[408:38.03]And where's the sledgehammer?
[408:49.06]Over here?
[408:52.22]Battery?
[408:53.54]Where's the sledgehammer?
[408:55.24]Deeper in?
[408:58.13]That's not it, right?
[408:58.75]No.
[409:00.39]There it is.
[409:05.39]And his orange juice and shit.
[409:17.71]Just let me take a second to look.
[409:21.29]Okay.
[409:22.47]I want the... What the fuck do I even put down?
[409:25.76]This random blade.
[409:27.76]Give me the other orange juice.
[409:28.78]I'm gonna put down a shotgun for the orange juice.
[409:31.02]It's more important.
[409:31.78]It is.
[409:36.66]Alright.
[409:36.96]Katana.
[409:42.68]Two heals.
[409:43.94]Drink one?
[409:44.52]Not yet.
[409:44.88]I don't need it.
[409:45.24]I will soon.
[409:51.61]If I see another orange juice, I'll be drinking it.
[410:14.35]Eight ball?
[410:16.35]Oh, he's losing his mind.
[410:17.82]OK.
[410:18.00]I see.
[410:18.46]That walking out.
[410:44.12]You know that kills people.
[410:46.18]They always show people waking up like four hours later.
[410:48.74]You're dead if someone does that to you and you hit you in the temple.
[410:52.04]You're dead.
[410:52.66]You're going to die.
[410:55.37]And if you don't wake up in... Your whole life is changed.
[411:03.21]All right, so don't... I have a shotgun.
[411:17.03]Hmm.
[411:18.25]Interesting.
[411:20.55]Interesting.
[411:21.15]I've got to kill this guy pretty quickly, too.
[411:31.02]Is he... Did he just... What's he... Why can he do this?
[411:34.28]Oh!
[411:47.59]That's a long fuse.
[411:48.97]That takes a long time.
[411:53.45]Do that again.
[411:54.63]I dare you.
[412:01.78]Where is it?
[412:06.84]I knew it was gonna happen.
[412:08.70]He shot me.
[412:28.33]I wonder if I should just run up there and just start fucking stabbing him.
[412:31.25]I'm going for it.
[412:44.90]Well, there are guns everywhere, so maybe that's... Got it!
[413:01.39]Alright, that's a good- it works.
[413:06.26]Fuck.
[413:18.63]Is there any healing?
[413:19.91]My health.
[413:23.65]Is there healing?
[413:24.11]Any healing?
[413:29.96]Don't do the thing!
[413:30.68]I look like... I look like a toddler.
[413:37.12]Alright, I get it.
[413:39.54]The spear did a lot of damage, it did.
[413:43.34]Checkpoint is not where... There's no checkpoint.
[413:47.90]Oh, no way.
[413:54.10]It's... I'm all the way back here.
[413:55.76]Oh, no, no, no.
[414:01.63]So... There was a save at the boss entrance.
[414:09.78]Oh, that's me being... This is my face right now.
[414:13.00]And I can't believe it.
[414:19.90]Forget about the hammer battery.
[414:21.30]It's pointless.
[414:22.87]Just throw grenades back, shoot them with the guns, stab them with your spear.
[414:30.13]Bring the sentry.
[414:31.49]I have to walk it the whole way.
[414:33.07]I'm not doing that.
[414:39.06]Video games suck.
[414:41.24]I hate video games.
[414:42.86]They're the worst.
[414:48.71]No, I forgot this one up there.
[414:51.87]Video games are not having fun.
[414:58.91]He finally admits it.
[415:03.97]I just killed, like, 50 people.
[415:17.00]Nah, we're good.
[415:17.64]We're good.
[415:18.86]We're good.
[415:19.62]Alright, this is... I can't believe I missed this save point.
[415:21.92]I'm so embarrassed.
[415:22.96]I'm gonna get the shotgun, though.
[415:27.68]I'm embarrassed.
[415:30.57]Somebody just spit in my face, I swear.
[415:33.75]Something just hit me in the mouth that was liquid-based, and I didn't do anything.
[415:37.65]Somebody spit right in my face.
[415:43.05]I need that double OJ.
[415:44.05]Am I seriously coughing from the... Alright, alright, okay, okay.
[415:57.74]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[416:06.20]I have to get the sludge hammer, shit, I know, I know guys.
[416:21.39]Thank you.
[416:24.26]Do I have two shotguns?
[416:25.18]If I don't, I thank god I do.
[416:27.24]Alright, I'm gonna drop this.
[416:38.87]Where they are?
[416:39.31]I forgot the orange juice bullshit over here.
[416:41.55]Where's that orange juice?
[416:55.15]What's over there?
[416:55.55]The save point!
[417:07.03]Uh, wait, this is 28.
[417:08.17]Let's do one of these ones, like 26.
[417:16.27]Alright, orange juice.
[417:23.36]There is no orange juice.
[417:24.22]I blew up the orange juice.
[417:27.04]I have to settle for these fucking stupid jelly beans.
[417:39.14]There's no OJ in these boxes.
[417:40.68]Nothing.
[417:43.66]Well, just gonna have to kill him.
[417:47.08]Get a beer hat.
[417:49.93]Beer hat.
[417:55.89]No.
[418:00.03]Should've brought Grandma.
[418:01.79]No, as long as I play this correctly, I just need to use the stabber.
[418:05.03]When he gets in close, stab him.
[418:06.39]Shoot him with the guns.
[418:07.61]Dodge.
[418:11.58]Just checking for orange juice.
[418:14.66]I thought that was a huge jug of orange juice.
[418:16.82]I was like, that's two to three of them in one container.
[418:20.37]That's disappointing.
[418:20.99]Alright, I can throw them back.
[418:34.52]We're gonna do shotgun first.
[418:36.86]Because it's easy, uh, tick damage.
[418:40.56]I ain't moving.
[418:49.64]Jesus Christ!
[418:54.30]Throw it.
[419:12.17]Grenade out.
[419:38.82]Gun.
[419:44.82]Don't lose it.
[419:52.57]If he throws a grenade, it's gonna be too far.
[419:55.59]Too far.
[419:56.07]That's too far, but I have to do it.
[419:57.19]I gotta go for it.
[420:08.67]Here he comes.
[420:13.92]Throw one.
[420:15.46]I'm losing time here.
[420:17.02]This is way too long to be spending on this bot.
[420:23.29]Jesus.
[420:33.94]I have a new plan.
[420:35.67]It's grenade.
[420:36.71]Stab like three times.
[420:37.79]I'm going to throw after he throws a grenade.
[420:39.13]Here we go.
[420:39.39]Ready?
[420:39.57]Watch this.
[420:39.95]It didn't work.
[421:10.11]No, don't shoot me, please!
[421:14.09]There's a rifle.
[421:14.69]Give me the rifle.
[421:15.26]Throw me over there.
[421:16.22]That's where I wanna be.
[421:27.02]Why did I do that?
[421:27.48]I'm gonna die.
[421:33.85]Oh, fuck!
[421:34.35]It bounced!
[421:35.55]Bad bounce.
[421:36.09]Really bad bounce.
[421:41.36]I've got to get over there.
[421:45.41]Change places with me.
[421:52.87]Wait.
[421:53.87]Wait!
[421:54.43]My turn!
[421:54.99]Oh, fuck!
[422:04.70]That's not great!
[422:24.40]The orange juices are destroyed the orange juices are destroyed.
[422:28.66]I can't even oh I'm so bad
[422:39.56]Just slash him.
[422:40.50]Okay, I'm going for the technique called, who cares, just go try to stab him in the face over and over again.
[422:46.76]And then dodge his kick.
[422:48.72]Wait, do we ever go over this?
[422:51.98]Wait, they respawn.
[422:53.54]They respawn, don't they?
[422:56.28]Joe juices!
[422:59.35]I gotta get this guy off.
[423:01.39]Get off?
[423:03.71]He's coming.
[423:07.57]They respawned.
[423:15.76]I can get the juices so that we're gonna get rid of... The shotguns are useless.
[423:21.18]It's not gonna work.
[423:22.73]I gotta get in there.
[423:23.93]I gotta throw grenades.
[423:25.75]Assault rifle will work.
[423:27.93]Shotgun's not gonna do it.
[423:47.43]I can't fucking believe it.
[423:48.61]Thank God you interrupted me.
[423:49.79]I'm just trying to get them.
[423:54.09]Thank God you interrupted me.
[423:55.45]Just pick it up, man.
[423:56.27]They're so fast.
[423:58.05]They just run up on you.
[424:00.15]Save it again.
[424:07.92]Just get away from me.
[424:10.48]No, redo it.
[424:18.81]Just redo it.
[424:20.05]For the love of... I need these two heals for this fight.
[424:28.09]Imagine killing the zombies.
[424:29.41]Imagine going over to kill the zombies, but they've upgraded their characters.
[424:35.26]And if they sneeze on you, it stuns you.
[424:54.29]I don't fucking care, just pick him up.
[425:05.12]Get the fuck out of my way!
[425:10.91]Why are you so hard?
[425:22.79]It's like running into a wall.
[425:26.57]You know, get rid of this fucking thing too.
[425:28.17]What a waste of space.
[425:30.75]I'm making a new one anyways.
[425:41.42]I'm ready.
[425:43.34]You know the plan.
[425:43.90]You know the drill.
[425:44.36]The drill is very simple.
[425:50.88]Nice job.
[425:54.34]So, where's the assault rifle?
[425:56.32]I know there's one over there.
[425:57.02]I'm going to wait until he... Just let it run.
[426:01.84]It's alright.
[426:02.78]Okay, here he comes.
[426:05.51]One stab.
[426:06.95]Dodger!
[426:12.57]Why is he chasing me?
[426:13.25]He's not supposed to do this.
[426:15.24]He's not supposed to do this.
[426:16.00]Assault rifle's over here.
[426:41.16]Don't shoot him.
[426:52.42]That didn't do very much damage considering he just got hit by two.
[427:08.89]I didn't get it!
[427:12.62]Oh my god, this is horrible.
[427:26.35]Aim for his head?
[427:30.66]It doesn't do anything.
[427:35.48]What is he doing?
[427:43.60]And they also have, like, when you shoot them, there's like a one or two second period where they have invincibility frames.
[428:03.22]Am I dead?
[428:10.75]I'm dead.
[428:13.36]Where is it?
[428:20.81]Just drink the oil.
[428:23.05]I wonder if there's anything else around here I could do.
[428:25.11]Oh fuck, it's over.
[428:35.92]He's gonna kick me!
[428:38.02]Oh god!
[428:43.03]I missed.
[428:50.99]So if I try to stab him more than once, he just... hits you.
[428:56.54]It's tough.
[428:57.78]I'll get it.
[428:58.12]I'm not- I'm not even gonna use a gun.
[429:02.48]The guns don't do- they're not that good.
[429:04.34]What's the most damaging thing that I have?
[429:21.55]Pick it up.
[429:23.07]Holy fuck.
[429:30.03]I think the stab takes too long.
[429:36.01]Switch items during a roll.
[429:47.72]Eat the trash can food?
[429:49.50]And I'll puke, yeah.
[430:06.37]Dude, there's nothing in that one?
[430:08.18]That's kind of stupid.
[430:13.70]Any more trash bags?
[430:14.54]I don't want to drill.
[430:21.18]That was like a... I thought that was a cantaloupe.
[430:29.06]Magazine of bikes?
[430:31.36]Bike durability will last three times longer.
[430:34.72]Somebody else can read that.
[430:42.94]How's the toughest boss treating you?
[430:45.56]Um... I mean, he's kind of annoying.
[430:50.03]It is hard, yeah.
[430:51.45]This guy sucks.
[430:52.31]Let's see if I can do it with melee.
[431:18.85]I wanted to take a photo.
[431:21.91]Left trigger, right bumper, and right trigger.
[431:37.77]Why did that not hurt him?
[431:40.27]Like, why did he not get hurt by that?
[431:43.76]I'm so confused.
[431:46.58]What the fuck?
[431:56.38]I clearly hit him right in the fucking chest.
[432:03.63]I can do two hits.
[432:11.33]I'm gonna cheese this right here.
[432:14.71]He's gonna go for a kick?
[432:16.05]Idiot.
[432:18.41]Who's the dumb one now?
[432:19.67]Sergeant... I can't even... I don't even know what his name is.
[432:21.98]He hit me with that.
[432:40.29]Now everyone's gonna laugh and go like, he missed J-L-O-L, he missed.
[432:44.51]Yeah?
[432:45.31]Did he?
[432:46.89]Did he?
[432:51.70]I don't think he did.
[433:01.00]Where the fuck did he go?
[433:15.64]He baited me!
[433:27.12]Tell me I'm wrong.
[433:28.02]Tell me!
[433:33.87]No, don't!
[433:34.27]Okay, just stay with the plan.
[433:35.33]Stay with the plan.
[433:49.08]I have to wait till he's done swinging?
[433:50.34]Fucking video games, man.
[434:01.21]Yeah?
[434:02.11]Yeah?
[434:03.21]Yeah?
[434:03.71]What would you like for dinner, son?
[434:05.11]Huh?
[434:07.83]Oh!
[434:15.64]Oh, I have to get this one.
[434:33.26]my life this is not friendly fire
[435:10.77]What are you doing?
[435:19.08]What did you do?
[435:19.90]Don't blow it here.
[435:31.92]I could just go
[435:38.23]No way.
[435:39.03]No fucking way, dude.
[435:41.37]He hit me from like six arm lengths.
[435:45.49]Six arm lengths away.
[435:46.85]No way.
[435:53.83]Swinging through this motherfucker.
[435:56.51]Oh, come on.
[435:57.81]Like, what the fuck?
[436:00.26]Should I hit him twice?
[436:01.12]I don't know if he's gonna... I'm swinging through the guy.
[436:07.68]He's got like 8 frames.
[436:10.24]No, no, no, no, no.
[436:11.40]He has like 16 invincibility frames when he swings.
[436:15.24]More than that, it's like 30.
[436:16.00]It's like 2, it's like 3, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like... It's like 5 seconds.
[436:27.71]Just get the juice again.
[436:28.93]I'll handle this.
[436:33.46]And you coughed in my face!
[436:34.92]Alright, I'm gonna fucking lose my mind.
[436:38.38]Relax!
[436:39.58]Get the... He's truly malding.
[436:56.45]That sucks, man!
[436:58.07]Come on!
[437:01.00]That sucks.
[437:02.41]Put the shotgun.
[437:03.17]I'm saving it with the juice.
[437:05.99]All right.
[437:06.29]Out of my way.
[437:14.12]What's with the ticking clock that I hear now?
[437:35.07]What is wrong with these guys?
[437:37.29]Okay.
[437:39.31]Yay.
[437:40.81]Yay.
[437:41.15]Hooray, we get to do it again.
[437:42.91]This time I know what to do, and this time hopefully I can hit him 50% of the time that I swing.
[437:52.10]I can't believe he did this elbow strike.
[437:57.06]If he hits you with any of his melees, you get to see a fun taunt kill every time.
[438:02.92]Let's go.
[438:08.70]Wait till he gets ammo.
[438:09.60]Get to that same spot that I was in.
[438:11.70]Or even... No, it's gotta be far enough away.
[438:16.79]This one is alright.
[438:21.39]I didn't like that setup.
[438:30.77]You guys think I'm cheating?
[438:31.67]This guy, when he attacks, has Game Genie turned on with every fucking code.
[438:41.76]He just doesn't exist.
[439:07.47]Truly, truly about to fucking go next level mad.
[439:14.01]I'm going to try this weapon.
[439:19.99]It's broken.
[439:31.24]It was the weapon.
[439:31.90]The weapon just is broken against this boss.
[439:35.34]What a catastrophe.
[439:36.94]Stop talking.
[439:49.79]He didn't even swing in the right direction.
[439:53.30]I'm just breaking this whole encounter.
[440:03.45]I honestly feel like I'm drinking Estus.
[440:05.49]That's what it actually feels like.
[440:19.10]This is not the run.
[440:20.20]This is not the run.
[440:22.82]You can only do it once.
[440:53.26]It's gonna happen.
[441:00.09]It's gonna happen.
[441:05.89]I will beat this guy.
[441:23.73]Okay.
[441:26.09]Everybody just relax.
[441:27.99]And there is extra juice on the ground.
[441:31.00]We can just scum this.
[441:33.56]Um, hold on a minute here.
[441:35.12]I'm gonna be a piece of scum.
[441:39.88]Like, truly dog shit.
[441:46.28]What magazine?
[441:47.24]No, I need this.
[441:52.03]No, I don't need that much.
[441:54.00]I really don't need that much.
[441:56.20]I just need my spear.
[441:57.18]Okay, I'm gonna drink.
[441:58.68]No.
[441:59.84]It's unlimited juice.
[442:01.22]It is.
[442:13.68]Okay, well, I worked.
[442:16.16]Imagine dying to a guy named Boykin.
[442:18.93]Stop!
[442:26.03]It's... Okay.
[442:31.78]Shit.
[442:34.02]Whatever.
[442:34.50]It's a person's name.
[442:35.78]That's not a big deal.
[442:36.52]Alright.
[442:38.72]I'm, like, sweating.
[442:39.94]Let's go.
[442:40.40]This slow... Watch out for the bullshit.
[442:43.10]I have plenty of... I can't think of the word.
[442:46.01]Healing.
[442:47.55]But when he... If he accidentally hits me through three walls...
[442:56.12]Somebody wrote MonkaS?
[442:57.62]Question mark.
[442:58.40]Like, is MonkaS?
[443:04.97]I have three Estus.
[443:07.37]Bring them this way.
[443:08.95]Okay, begin the carousel.
[443:45.88]Greeting!
[444:41.02]Fuck you!
[444:42.30]He's not dead.
[444:46.42]I need that fire axe.
[444:47.10]Way to go.
[445:05.11]Yay!
[445:05.69]Oh, yay, yay, yay, we did it!
[445:13.17]I can't believe a worthless zombie did me in.
[445:22.02]It was easy.
[445:24.06]Hey, Rebecca.
[445:24.76]Don't make me laugh.
[445:26.54]Right now.
[445:27.72]But you ain't gonna bite me.
[445:30.24]You ain't gonna turn me.
[445:32.90]I'll never be one of you.
[445:40.54]Get down!
[445:42.12]Are you okay?
[445:52.13]My leg's a little... I'm not gonna let you bite me.
[445:55.76]That said, I'll handle the field reporting from now on.
[446:03.25]There's a 7-4.
[446:06.59]How much time?
[446:08.44]Okay, well now we have a problem.
[446:12.64]Get me to the safe house.
[446:16.56]We have a problem.
[446:27.93]How am I going to do this in time?
[446:29.25]There's another case after this.
[446:43.25]Just go fast.
[446:46.34]Who the hell are these guys?
[446:47.48]Am I private?
[446:49.58]What's going on?
[446:51.58]Guys, can we just go?
[446:52.66]Let's go.
[446:53.12]Come with me.
[446:54.70]We've been wiped out.
[446:55.66]Save for me and us.
[446:56.46]Okay, yep.
[446:57.38]Good.
[446:57.76]We intend to follow that last truck down the tunnel.
[446:59.64]No, this is just us.
[447:00.70]Follow me.
[447:03.10]Let's go.
[447:04.34]They got guns.
[447:05.18]Good.
[447:07.02]That's a long way to go.
[447:19.81]Faster!
[447:50.61]Hurry, this way.
[447:52.21]Come on, speed it up.
[447:56.49]Let's hustle it up.
[447:58.97]Come on.
[447:59.81]Keep an eye out.
[448:01.61]Keep up.
[448:03.52]Let's go.
[448:04.32]Hey, keep up.
[448:06.48]Come on, speed it up.
[448:09.66]Follow me.
[448:10.98]A little bit further.
[448:14.86]Hurry, this way.
[448:16.80]Move it.
[448:17.92]Hey, I'm waiting on you.
[448:25.42]Did I lose somebody?
[448:57.75]Got him.
[449:01.61]Hurry up!
[449:02.99]Come on, speed it up!
[449:04.91]Come on!
[449:05.71]Hey, I'm waiting on you!
[449:08.33]Follow me!
[449:10.40]Up then!
[449:12.02]Clean.
[449:12.86]Clean it up.
[449:13.24]Let's move!
[449:14.42]Don't worry, I got this.
[449:16.98]Hurry up!
[449:18.54]Speed it up!
[449:23.09]Let's go!
[449:25.65]Press X instead of triangle.
[449:29.61]Whatever, different controller, same idea.
[450:03.40]Bingo.
[450:14.77]Got them all.
[450:15.39]Come on.
[450:15.97]All three of them.
[450:16.55]Hurry up.
[450:17.67]Don't breathe in the gas.
[450:20.93]One, two, three.
[450:22.77]Go.
[450:32.06]What happened to the zombies out there?
[450:34.38]They went berserk.
[450:35.80]This doesn't look right.
[450:36.70]There was some sort of gas.
[450:38.74]As soon as the zombies came in contact with it, they changed.
[450:43.92]Sound like some good shit.
[450:45.36]I have to try something myself.
[450:53.27]What you looking at?
[450:57.35]We need him alive.
[450:59.23]That's a real shame.
[451:02.78]going on tk it's almost like the actor was so bad that they just superimposed a mask on and redubbed all of his lines I don't know he was just the name they gave me they what are you talking about somebody had to take the fall and ain't you cute trying to figure it all out frankie west where
[451:34.19]Just Darth Vader.
[451:38.66]That does have some relevance.
[451:41.58]You're right.
[451:44.36]It's not worth it.
[451:45.94]He's not going anywhere.
[452:04.04]That mask has to weigh a ton.
[452:05.66]That thing's probably 10 to 15 pounds at least.
[452:07.80]That's like an 8 pound, 9 pound, 10 pound.
[452:30.83]He smells really bad too.
[452:33.23]He's been in it for a long time.
[452:35.25]But he's nose blind.
[452:38.74]He has no idea what it smells like in there.
[452:40.04]When he takes that off and somebody's around him, it'll be like, holy, this is horrible.
[452:44.14]I gotta hotwire that panel.
[452:59.65]Wouldn't you love to see, like, the thermal camera when he takes that helmet off?
[453:04.05]Just like the... Alright.
[453:12.86]Save.
[453:14.10]Okay.
[453:16.90]Yeah, so funny.
[453:18.16]Hey, thanks.
[453:21.40]Which one do I do?
[453:23.60]This one?
[453:23.98]Probably the one that's... Yeah, this one here.
[453:33.02]Find the generator, gas barrel, and spool of wire.
[453:37.88]Take each item to the gate panel at the safe house entrance to hack the gate.
[453:41.86]Love with the gate and secure the safe house.
[453:44.00]Generator, gas barrel, spool of wire.
[453:46.76]Uh... Well... Well, I'm gonna go this way.
[453:55.92]Oh, everyone's... People can die here!
[454:02.30]People are dying here.
[454:18.59]Bring it to the broken panel.
[454:19.71]Okay, there's one.
[454:21.95]Generator.
[454:24.23]Oh, man.
[454:26.63]Oh, fuck.
[454:27.51]This is not... Okay.
[454:30.85]Okay.
[454:32.59]Anim is dead.
[454:35.61]Who's Anim?
[454:38.53]Where's this thing?
[454:39.11]What am I looking for?
[454:40.88]Spool of wire?
[454:41.86]Gas barrel.
[454:43.38]Spool of wire?
[454:47.62]Where's this wire?
[454:49.90]Pac-Yoon?
[454:52.45]Wrong room.
[455:03.82]Who's Wade?
[455:06.43]Kirby is dead!
[455:09.11]Oh no, Kirby.
[455:11.55]Poor Kirby.
[455:24.42]Excuse me.
[455:25.92]Excuse me!
[455:39.21]Reset Kirby died.
[455:42.91]Spill the wire and now I need a gas barrel, which is... Apparently, like, very close to right here, I think.
[455:52.68]I don't know.
[455:55.18]Chris!
[456:10.92]Gas barrel.
[456:12.02]That's a propane barrel.
[456:14.28]Lulu.
[456:14.78]These are all made-up people, so this is not canon people.
[456:17.26]Who cares about these people?
[456:21.82]Oh, no.
[456:22.26]Not Chris.
[456:24.96]I had such a connection with that character.
[456:38.85]These people just accidentally found their way in here.
[456:44.30]Crystal's the only real person.
[456:46.18]And she's doing just fine.
[456:49.74]Okay, now... Is that it?
[456:54.96]Hack the panel.
[456:57.57]How does one hack a panel?
[457:05.83]Uh... Where's the panel?
[457:26.69]Wait wait no you guys are gonna back up the zombie part you're getting a little too close too quickly Reset to one wait for the actor to come through
[457:53.42]Okay.
[458:22.07]Did I do it?
[458:22.65]I did it!
[458:31.52]Hack the... I think I did it.
[458:38.07]I win.
[458:39.29]Did I actually do it?
[458:55.32]Forever loading screen.
[458:56.58]That's a problem.
[458:57.42]That's not good.
[458:59.04]I think we're going to have to reset the game.
[459:13.02]Just wait?
[459:21.11]What if it corrupts my save?
[459:24.45]Just wait.
[459:27.45]No, that's it.
[459:35.27]I'll give it 10 more seconds.
[459:41.26]It's loading a really great cinematic.
[459:44.06]It's loading 30,000 people on screen at once.
[459:48.73]They're all dressed as Blanka.
[460:01.06]You gotta know when to fold.
[460:01.98]This is a fold scenario.
[460:03.88]Let's try it again.
[460:11.65]Where's the last checkpoint?
[460:17.12]Now that's a great question.
[460:18.84]It was right before that, I think.
[460:29.15]Let's try it again.
[460:29.83]Uh-oh, that's not... That's a sound I haven't heard before when opening the game.
[460:33.04]Uh, the game's not opening, but it's playing sound.
[460:46.88]I don't even have it on my task manager.
[460:55.27]There's just a weird window here.
[461:06.58]That was weird.
[461:10.04]Let's try that again.
[461:11.03]Okay.
[461:14.81]Starting to get a little concerned here.
[461:31.96]I think we're good.
[461:33.76]There we go.
[461:46.47]Start game.
[461:51.96]Uh, yeah, we're okay.
[461:52.90]It's right here, right?
[461:54.68]Yep.
[461:54.86]I just have to do all that bullshit again.
[462:02.96]All right, how do I prevent that from happening though?
[462:11.89]I'm kind of scared of this mission Where am I going?
[462:34.46]Oh.
[462:35.20]Cool, a Nectar.
[462:35.84]Anything else back here?
[462:50.17]Use it!
[462:50.93]Watch this!
[462:51.37]This is gonna be crazy.
[462:53.05]Give me the queen.
[462:56.81]Yeah.
[463:12.14]Alright, we're back, we're back, we're back, we're back, we're back, we're back, we're back, we're back.
[463:14.54]Wait, there's a PC gaming wiki article about this?
[463:22.27]There's no way to progress.
[463:32.98]I can't click this, it'll crash the game.
[463:34.70]Uh, give me a, give me a TLDR of what that says.
[463:56.74]Use your phone.
[463:59.36]It's okay.
[464:00.32]Alright, well, whatever.
[464:01.06]Wait, is it in the other room?
[464:04.09]No, it's down here, isn't it?
[464:05.05]No, it's in the other room.
[464:20.25]Wait.
[464:20.89]Let me just see if I can get it to work once.
[464:52.54]Alright, let's get that last one.
[464:54.08]I'm changing one value.
[464:58.82]Alright, alright.
[464:59.78]Guys, I don't know if I'm going to have to change INI files.
[465:03.85]Like, 90% of the way through the game.
[465:06.23]Come on.
[465:08.43]What do you want to build here?
[465:19.96]It's the gas barrel.
[465:21.00]I'm looking at chat.
[465:24.00]Alright, so I'm going to pause it, and then unpause it and pause it really fast and see what happens.
[465:36.11]Hurry before Crystal dies.
[465:37.03]Okay.
[466:29.05]All right, where's the file?
[466:37.56]I've given the link.
[466:38.12]Where is it?
[466:38.54]Is that rising?
[466:39.74]Rising link.
[466:40.40]There it is.
[466:40.96]Okay, so go to my user profile settings.
[466:44.36]Yeah.
[466:50.96]Edit the INI.
[466:51.76]Okay.
[466:52.02]Yeah, I just got to get it.
[466:57.74]Open user, yeah, the user profile.
[467:05.52]Documents, my games, dead rising off the record.
[467:08.10]Okay.
[467:13.58]Brown cam.
[467:17.09]Okay.
[467:21.53]Don't tell him where it is.
[467:22.59]He's deleting the game.
[467:27.38]Alright.
[467:28.82]It's documents, right?
[467:30.44]What the hell?
[467:30.98]Documents.
[467:31.72]No, you have to do like the percent, percent, percent thing.
[467:34.04]What's it called?
[467:34.50]Percent?
[467:35.12]User profile percent?
[467:36.66]Or is that just... Okay.
[467:49.48]Documents, my games.
[467:55.64]Mm-hmm.
[467:58.91]Dead Rising 2 off the record.
[468:00.51]There's the render settings.
[468:06.43]Change the use multicore to false.
[468:17.34]False.
[468:18.06]Save.
[468:20.02]After getting past this loading screen, you are free to change it back.
[468:35.42]What if I just keep it?
[468:36.16]I'm gonna be on one core.
[468:45.03]Suit up.
[468:58.12]You get a poodle face when you're pissed.
[469:02.22]I don't- I'm not even really sure what you mean by that.
[469:07.89]My MacBook is heating up.
[469:09.11]I know!
[469:10.51]I'm working on it.
[469:14.73]Oh, this is horrible.
[469:18.03]Okay, I have to get through this.
[469:20.60]This is 10 frames a second.
[469:23.88]No.
[469:39.38]It's hard mode.
[469:44.80]I am not going to leave this if we're saving it right when this is done.
[469:47.58]You know, I used to play games like this, guys.
[470:01.41]It sucked.
[470:04.05]I played games like this.
[470:10.82]And the resolution was even lower.
[470:25.17]Give me the back.
[470:27.61]Give me this pole.
[470:31.67]You know, it's the sound that's doing it too.
[470:39.58]I think button presses are not registering at some point.
[470:56.31]Wrong way.
[470:57.07]I know I'm going the wrong way.
[470:58.81]It's hard to pay attention.
[471:06.56]It's buffering inputs.
[471:07.80]Yeah, it is.
[471:15.21]It's like using traps.
[471:27.10]I think I actually played all of Soldier of Fortune like this.
[471:46.28]How?
[471:46.82]I don't know.
[471:47.42]I did.
[471:50.72]I'm specifically remembering this insane slowdown with my computer.
[471:54.16]My computer was a piece of crap.
[472:02.87]Okay.
[472:03.37]Moment of truth.
[472:04.35]Did it work?
[472:12.85]It worked.
[472:17.93]Nice.
[472:32.12]Yeah!
[472:36.08]That was not an accident.
[472:38.04]What happened to Sullivan?
[472:39.74]He's supposed to be keeping this place secure.
[472:42.52]Or is leaving your post part of standard operating procedure?
[472:46.94]He's gonna tell me.
[472:48.62]Right now.
[472:56.15]And... Ladies and gentlemen.
[473:04.99]We've reached the eight hour mark.
[473:15.71]We have...
[473:20.23]probably because there's there's definitely something after this as well you said dude I said I was going to try to finish it I said I was going to try to finish it so
[473:50.56]I have... I have doctor shit to do over the next couple days.
[474:08.99]I'm trying to think of... How much time is actually left?
[474:12.65]Like probably four, five, six hours?
[474:14.07]Something like that?
[474:14.56]I could probably have another stream on this.
[474:21.55]There's another maybe six hours or so.
[474:23.37]Four hours, six hours.
[474:25.37]Then that's a whole, that's another stream then.
[474:32.07]Four hours.
[474:34.10]Because is there an overtime in this game?
[474:37.00]I'll be doing that too.
[474:44.24]Okay.
[474:47.63]Yeah.
[474:48.03]All right, guys.
[474:48.59]Yeah.
[474:49.25]Yeah.
[474:51.47]It was a ton of fucking fun.
[474:53.79]I love this game.
[474:56.05]But... We are going... This is probably not going to be the only thing we do on Friday.
[475:03.08]Because if I can... If I blow through this in like two or three hours, then we'll just move on to the next thing.
[475:11.45]So we're going to open with Dead Rising 2 off the record.
[475:14.59]We're going to beat it.
[475:19.59]What kind of doctor stuff?
[475:20.47]I have a couple of appointments that I need to go to.
[475:24.75]And one of them is long.
[475:30.46]So, we'll see you on Friday.
[475:32.74]We'll conclude this.
[475:35.10]Let me save it and make sure everything is good to go.
[475:37.54]I like it.
[475:42.40]I love this game, though.
[475:43.44]I love these both, Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2.
[475:47.11]It's just... It's equal parts frustrating.
[475:51.31]Hilarious.
[475:53.65]Stressful.
[475:55.73]And I love this game.
[475:57.19]Alright, we're gonna go with Safe Slot 1.
[476:09.08]That's the best kind of game.
[476:11.00]I know, it really is.
[476:14.33]But we'll see you Friday.
[476:14.93]I'm just gonna let this play out and make sure I have a good spot.
[476:24.50]Yeah, I'll change the config back.
[476:25.62]Wait, did he just die?
[476:33.28]I'll do that right before.
[476:33.98]I'll do it actually while we're just hanging out at the end.
[476:41.49]Uh, last thing I knew, I was sitting by the door like usual.
[476:47.77]Next thing I was coming to, looking at you.
[476:50.90]You must have gotten loose somehow.
[476:54.66]I can't believe you got the better of me.
[476:57.34]Well, I can tell you right now, that isn't gonna happen again.
[477:02.76]You gotta get me Zombrex, Frankie.
[477:05.33]And you gotta move.
[477:07.41]No, he needs his own bricks.
[477:08.63]How much money do I have?
[477:38.52]It's $150,000 for an extra Zombrex from the store.
[477:41.75]I have two, yeah.
[478:02.00]There's a weird shitty X-Men.
[478:25.27]Wrong information.
[478:26.65]Now calm down and relax.
[478:27.77]Calm down?
[478:28.79]The government is going to bomb us.
[478:30.63]No, he's up there, missy.
[478:32.39]The government is simply not going to kill a bunch of unarmed civilians.
[478:36.33]That would be un-American.
[478:37.81]Hey, we simply need to go out there and take control.
[478:41.46]Go out there?
[478:42.38]Are you out of your mind?
[478:44.24]Fighting won't get us anywhere.
[478:46.76]You know what would make this game so much better?
[478:51.00]If Frank West had intermittent rick burps.
[479:15.20]He'd access the media with that lie that we're all dead.
[479:18.12]And he couldn't order a military firebombing.
[479:20.62]This is bigger than TK.
[479:23.74]Way bigger.
[479:25.58]Look, I know we've all been through a lot in the past few days, but don't go making it worse and start making things up.
[479:32.97]Where'd that gas come from?
[479:34.31]Let me see your camera.
[479:40.91]It's too late for that kind of... Retrack that?
[479:46.44]No, it stays.
[479:47.02]Uh...
[480:11.21]You still got a sprained ankle.
[480:12.19]Sit down.
[480:15.97]Shrek.
[480:24.21]I'm getting a little, uh... I'm getting a little asleep.
[480:27.23]I'm not even that tired.
[480:28.17]I kind of am, but not really.
[480:30.17]Go for the kiss.
[480:31.25]Do it.
[480:37.30]I thought she was gonna go for a kiss.
[480:42.29]Alright, save it.
[480:50.57]Alright, we got lots of time.
[481:01.46]So, now we're good to go.
[481:03.06]Game is saved.
[481:05.46]I'll see you guys on Friday.
[481:11.28]Hell yeah.
[481:18.50]no change the file yeah I'll do it right now restart story I want to get it done tonight but it's all right I'd rather not push it into like early this morning and already starting to lose my mind and I mean I don't want to reach simpsons hit and run levels of insanity
[481:52.05]So, we'll see you Friday.
[481:56.03]Have a good midweek.
[481:57.11]We'll finish this up.
[481:57.73]We'll start... You know what I might do on Friday after Dead Rising?
[482:11.66]Because that would be a pretty good spot to do it, I think.
[482:20.63]Katamari for Xbox 360.
[482:32.44]That sounds like a pretty good place to do it.
[482:34.80]Start with Dead Rising.
[482:36.40]And who knows?
[482:37.50]Dead Rising 2 might just take the whole stream.
[482:41.58]Depends on how long overtime takes.
[482:43.16]Depends on how many times I fail over and over again at a certain part.
[482:48.04]I'm not sure.
[482:48.48]We'll see.
[482:51.21]Am I going to do Dead Rising 3?
[482:54.90]Yes.
[482:56.22]But that will be the last one that I do.
[483:01.72]I'm not going to play Dead Rising 4.
[483:08.29]I already did.
[483:10.35]And I did not like it at all.
[483:17.29]Ban him for life.
[483:20.91]But I'm not going to do Dead Rising 3 immediately.
[483:22.67]I actually didn't even plan to do Dead Rising 2 immediately.
[483:25.97]I just kind of was like, you know what?
[483:27.39]Let's do it.
[483:31.67]Thanks for sticking around as always.
[483:36.13]These are some of my favorite types of games to play.
[483:38.84]Because I feel like there's a lot of fun interactions to have.
[483:41.98]There's a lot of ways the game can be played.
[483:44.88]So, I'm having a blast.
[483:48.68]But!
[483:50.05]That is the end.
[483:50.81]I will see you Friday.
[483:51.71]Let's do the bits.
[483:55.54]Going back.
[483:57.72]To Abomination Zero, thanks for the $2.50.
[483:59.32]I mailed you a cookie in an envelope full of milk.
[484:04.16]It's up to you to eat it or turn it down and give up your point.
[484:07.69]You have 72 hours to decide.
[484:11.69]Well, at that point, it would be rotten.
[484:12.97]I don't think it would be very edible.
[484:18.81]Thank you, though.
[484:20.28]I feel like I would be way, way too ADHD to play that game.
[484:22.22]Doesn't that require real strategy and tactics?
[484:24.19]You can't just run in there and just start throwing grenades.
[484:50.95]Put it on the list.
[484:55.04]Rainbow Six Vegas 2.
[484:55.94]That might be a disaster.
[485:02.72]But add it, yeah?
[485:04.45]I'm alright.
[485:05.19]Let's do it.
[485:05.67]Whatever.
[485:07.95]Jerma asks, stinky feet, thanks for the 250 bits.
[485:10.87]Hey Jerma, I know you hate my username.
[485:13.09]I don't think it's that funny anymore either.
[485:17.49]The serious question.
[485:18.99]I got diagnosed with ADHD a few months ago and was wondering if you had any tips for doing schoolwork without taking Adderall.
[485:24.96]I don't want to become dependent on it and you've been living with ADHD for longer than I have.
[485:29.26]I used to actually take Adderall.
[485:32.46]20 years ago.
[485:33.98]It suppressed my appetite.
[485:35.63]That and Ritalin is what I was on.
[485:37.55]I switched.
[485:39.13]It suppressed my appetite.
[485:41.55]I didn't like it.
[485:44.43]So I stopped taking it.
[485:48.01]And you kind of just have to try... You just have to let it take over, if I'm honest.
[485:58.86]Because when you have ADHD, you have scatterbrain all over the place.
[486:05.77]But when you scatter, each individual piece should be something that you can focus on enough to make something work.
[486:17.64]You kind of just have to... Unless you want to take medicine for it, because there really is no other way.
[486:24.63]You either take some medication to, like, kind of even you out a little bit, or you just kind of play it out.
[486:32.41]And this is what I'm focusing on right now.
[486:33.83]This is what I care about right now.
[486:34.87]Okay, well, do it very well for the time that you're going to focus on it.
[486:41.81]How people with ADHD get in trouble, and I've done it in the past, is...
[486:47.65]You get scattered, but you don't focus on any of the things you're scattering around.
[486:53.85]And you spread out so much, and you're just so, so distractible that you don't... You need to at least have one of those things be something that you can pay attention to for a while.
[487:05.68]Some people have it way worse than others.
[487:10.15]But there's no... I mean, not that I've been able to even think of... There's no, oh yeah, just...
[487:15.79]Do this, and your ADHD will go away.
[487:18.11]It's not... I guess... If you want, like, actual advice... Uh, turn off your phone.
[487:26.29]That's number one.
[487:27.99]If you're doing something important, don't have your phone in your room with you.
[487:32.75]Or an iPad, or... You don't want to have any distractions like that, because it's so easy to pick up a phone.
[487:42.79]What happened?
[487:43.15]Let me check my Twitter.
[487:44.97]Let me check this.
[487:45.41]Let me do this.
[487:48.59]Quiet the room down.
[487:49.79]Even stuff like listening to music can distract the part of your brain that needs to be distracted while you do something else.
[488:00.97]So your mind gets to play with the songs that are being played while you do the work.
[488:11.26]That helps.
[488:13.16]Even background noise doesn't even need to be music.
[488:16.95]Put on a podcast.
[488:17.83]Put on something just to have something to pay attention to while you're doing something.
[488:25.55]That's what I use Twitch for.
[488:27.67]Yeah, and if it works, it works.
[488:32.24]That's how I watch your streams.
[488:37.40]Also, moving around.
[488:39.68]Somebody just said pace around.
[488:42.25]That actually helps too.
[488:46.19]Moving around while you're doing something?
[488:49.15]Oh yeah.
[488:51.39]Just don't move around away from your desk too long.
[488:54.82]But go over something in your head, sit down, write it down, do whatever you're going to do.
[488:57.82]Get up, move around a little bit, have something in your hand.
[489:03.30]Rubik's cubes are great, but you have to know how to do them.
[489:05.41]Otherwise you're just going to continue to... You don't have to get it right.
[489:14.64]But also, if you don't want to take... If you've never taken something like Adderall before, request to see if you can get put on a low dose.
[489:23.10]Sometimes you don't need that much.
[489:24.62]You just need, like, enough to start to correct you.
[489:34.46]At least up there.
[489:35.26]If you have chemicals kind of imbalanced and all flying around, sometimes a low dose...
[489:43.92]The doctor might just be like, yeah, you know, we can start you off on this, and see how you do.
[489:52.58]Instead of just going, just balls to the wall, give me a full dose, and then you feel like shit, and then you get scared of it.
[489:59.04]Because you don't want to take it anymore.
[490:04.79]And it ain't just Adderall.
[490:06.59]There's a lot of different medications out there now.
[490:10.11]Some of them might be better for you than others.
[490:19.12]There are a lot of options.
[490:21.31]Do I still take?
[490:22.05]No, I have not taken it in a long time.
[490:27.53]Contrary to what you guys might actually believe, I've slowed down a lot.
[490:33.01]I used to be uncontrollable.
[490:37.34]I was all over the place 20 years ago, 15 years ago.
[490:44.04]I had so much energy that had to be expelled.
[490:53.27]If you think that I'm all over the place now, you should have seen like 15 year old me.
[490:59.59]I was off the walls.
[491:10.93]Did it calm down on its own?
[491:12.01]It sort of did, but it's always there.
[491:13.71]It doesn't matter.
[491:14.57]Guys, I'll put my keys down on the counter, and I'll... something will... I'll walk in another room, and then the keys don't exist anymore, and I walk around the whole fucking house searching for them, and they're just right in front of me.
[491:35.96]I lose things so easily.
[491:37.52]That's why I have to keep everything in my pocket.
[491:41.76]Everything that I need stays with me.
[491:49.78]And that's why I got those tiles.
[491:52.20]To be able to ping my stuff.
[491:55.20]When I inevitably lose it every single day.
[492:00.83]And I've complained about those things too.
[492:02.99]Is there any product that I like?
[492:05.47]Have you guys ever heard me talk about a product that I own that I actually enjoyed?
[492:09.17]Does that happen?
[492:17.10]McChickens.
[492:17.94]Okay.
[492:18.30]Dr. Oetker's Pizza.
[492:19.46]Alright.
[492:19.84]Hash House A Go Go at the link.
[492:21.38]Okay.
[492:22.38]Banana milk.
[492:23.54]Yeah.
[492:24.06]Alright.
[492:24.76]Bananas.
[492:25.18]JetBlue.
[492:25.72]That's right.
[492:27.40]Cheez-Its.
[492:27.94]Okay.
[492:28.30]You got me.
[492:28.84]Yeah.
[492:29.42]JetBlue is the best airline.
[492:30.50]Like, without a doubt.
[492:31.29]No questions asked.
[492:34.69]If you can fly on JetBlue, do not ever take another airplane for the rest of your life.
[492:39.61]Just don't.
[492:40.09]There's no reason to.
[492:44.09]Alaska Airlines is better.
[492:46.70]I'm not... Maybe.
[492:47.68]But that's a smaller airline.
[492:49.43]I don't know.
[492:49.89]JetBlue's pretty good.
[492:54.93]Their seats are really comfortable.
[492:56.41]They did free snacks.
[492:58.41]Wi-Fi on every plane.
[493:01.93]They got a ton of direct flights.
[493:03.65]You... Listen to this.
[493:04.83]You want to fly a shitload of the other airlines?
[493:08.25]Oh, wait.
[493:08.62]We're stopping first.
[493:11.28]JetBlue's got a bunch of great direct flights.
[493:20.15]Use code GERMA.
[493:21.52]That would never happen.
[493:25.26]These airlines make so much money.
[493:27.86]They don't need me to sign up a handful of people to buy an airplane ticket.
[493:36.81]They make like $100 million a week.
[493:41.35]Use the code GERMA and get 10% off.
[493:44.17]They don't need me.
[493:48.84]Use code LOOKATME and get 5% off.
[493:56.72]But they do.
[494:04.08]To kind of end that tangent there is... Sometimes you just have to let it work out.
[494:13.83]If you start getting distracted, take a break.
[494:16.39]Get up, move around.
[494:18.79]The reason why I can sit here for so long is because the stuff that I'm doing is so... rapid-fire that I can't get distracted.
[494:26.38]I get- ooh, I get distracted in the game, but not enough for me to have to stand up and go do something else.
[494:33.10]You see it happen in the video game.
[494:40.07]I mean, I've been here for 8 hours and 15 minutes.
[494:44.83]I got up once to pee and grab a water and shake my legs a little bit, and I'm able to do that.
[494:51.26]There's enough stimulation going on with this stream, with people talking and chat and game stuff, and yeah, I can get distracted really easily, but it's contained here.
[495:08.79]But, I wish you luck on your ADHD adventure.
[495:12.45]The best part about ADHD is... It is very, very, very manageable.
[495:22.96]And sometimes I attribute it to some of the things that I come up with.
[495:31.11]So, it's not a complete curse.
[495:38.42]ADHD Adventures.
[495:42.78]ADHD Comedy.
[495:45.22]Why do I feel like that would be a great YouTube channel name?
[495:48.45]It probably already is.
[495:49.35]And it's like quick 10 second videos that are all in a playlist.
[495:56.37]Like 10 to 15 second comedy videos.
[496:05.34]That's Vine.
[496:08.59]Right.
[496:09.09]But that doesn't exist anymore.
[496:10.49]It was taken over by TikTok.
[496:16.48]TikTok is Vine, but people just lip-sync their favorite songs.
[496:30.21]But anyways.
[496:32.40]Thank you, C4G, for the 300 bits.
[496:33.94]I haven't been able to watch this stream, but my girlfriend is.
[496:36.76]And they say, I get the allure of the face cards, Jerma.
[496:40.38]Really, I really do.
[496:41.62]But if you have at least three of a suit, my best bet is to hold those instead, you absolute fucking fool.
[496:48.27]But I'm the bits giver in this relationship.
[496:54.79]We're playing Jacks or Better.
[496:56.33]Face cards, Jacks or Better, you get your bet back.
[497:01.57]Hold a three of a suit, but if you get queen and king, you get queen jack.
[497:05.94]Jacks are better.
[497:06.68]Gives you bet back.
[497:10.60]That's the machine we were playing.
[497:11.56]Not every machine is jacks are better.
[497:17.28]Go all in every time.
[497:19.20]What's the worst that could happen?
[497:23.18]Thank you, DarkSoul, for the 250.
[497:24.46]Can you explain to us why you have that massive Iken has cheeseburger tattoo on your back?
[497:32.46]Don't have an explanation for that.
[497:33.56]No, it's not.
[497:35.52]It's something else.
[497:36.04]It's something else.
[497:36.56]I'm sure it doesn't help.
[497:37.16]He hates to laugh.
[498:03.70]It is not... We don't think it is like bowel and irritable bowel disease, like colitis related.
[498:13.63]Something else is going on.
[498:16.25]I don't know.
[498:18.25]We're going to figure out what the hell is going on.
[498:25.32]I've had a lot of random just doctor's appointments, and I know, we kind of know what's going on.
[498:31.93]I don't think it's anything serious.
[498:33.73]I've had a ton of tests and a ton of stuff poking and prodding.
[498:41.55]But we're narrowing down and it's just kind of annoying.
[498:47.60]If it is the thing that it might be, there's no reason for me to talk about it because I don't want to concern anybody.
[498:53.96]Don't worry.
[498:55.12]There's no concern.
[498:55.86]It's just an annoying thing that I have to figure out.
[499:02.36]So don't worry.
[499:07.94]There's nothing serious but annoying.
[499:09.56]Yeah.
[499:12.12]I will know much more very, very soon.
[499:14.43]We'll put it that way.
[499:19.61]But the reason... I don't really talk that much about medical stuff just because I... Sometimes I'll talk about it in like pre-stream or... Oh, I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow.
[499:28.43]Oh, don't worry.
[499:30.88]I don't want to concern anybody about anything.
[499:33.42]Everything's going to be... I'm fine.
[499:34.80]Don't worry.
[499:35.18]I don't want people to start like, wait, wait, hold on.
[499:39.46]What's wrong with him?
[499:40.20]Is something wrong with him?
[499:41.37]Something's wrong with him.
[499:46.95]So, don't worry.
[499:49.87]We'll be good to go.
[499:53.90]But, swiggity swanky.
[499:54.82]I appreciate the $2.50.

[500:41.57]Thank you for your 300 bits.
[500:44.19]Sorry to hear about your awesome dog.
[500:54.27]It's tough, it is.
[500:57.58]Yeah.
[500:58.02]Sometimes they're around for a very long time.
[501:08.47]We're going to sneak into this portion of the stream here.
[501:12.51]Let's get that there.
[501:14.81]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[501:15.65]See you Friday.
[501:19.31]We got the credits to do.
[501:21.29]All the subs that rolled in.
[501:27.37]That's a little odd.
[501:28.53]Error.
[501:28.95]Unable to detect stream start on your platform.
[501:33.77]What are you talking about?
[501:37.27]Streamlabs error for some reason.
[501:48.71]Let me go in here and see why that's doing that.
[501:51.31]Stream was never started in the first place.
[501:55.17]Weird.
[501:55.59]Let's see if I can run it from the website itself.
[502:14.27]Streamlabs is not even connected to my Twitch anymore.
[502:19.33]Do they do like an update?
[502:21.24]Learn how to stream like a pro.
[502:25.08]Okay.
[502:28.76]I'll try.
[502:29.24]Alright, let me see if I can do through here.
[502:33.70]Live events.
[502:34.26]I need the actual widget.
[502:43.61]What's wrong with this thing?
[502:46.13]Okay.
[502:49.97]Let's try it again.
[502:50.65]Here we go.
[502:53.39]Roll the credits.
[503:00.28]Uh... No.
[503:01.30]Unable to detect stream.
[503:06.20]This is not cool.
[503:10.28]Something's wrong with Streamlabs.
[503:16.76]We may not be able to see the sub-credits today.
[503:19.19]I think it's broken.
[503:28.15]Let me try it one more time.
[503:38.74]Credit settings.
[503:40.16]Sorry I'm taking so long.
[503:43.56]Test?
[503:43.80]I'm going to just test it.
[503:47.80]Not doing anything.
[503:51.16]Unable to detect stream start on your platforms.
[503:54.50]Yeah, something's wrong here.
[503:57.54]Sorry, guys.
[503:58.40]Sorry that usually the subscribers all fly by here.
[504:04.70]Maybe it's on Twitch's end?
[504:05.68]Maybe.
[504:07.84]But anyways, thank you so much for subbing in the first place.
[504:13.33]do have the final couple of bits here from flugboy thanks to the 250 jerma had some bits lying around my couch seats while I was cleaning from my move hope you're doing well friend also did you see the joker and what did you think I've not seen it I've not had very much time to wait what is going on here

[505:03.36]All right.
[505:10.71]I've not seen the Joker.
[505:12.40]I plan on seeing it soon.
[505:17.85]Thank you, BGFKJ, for the thousand bits.
[505:22.69]I had a dream of you.
[505:24.61]You chased me through my room and put a knife against me, saying something about Saints Row 2.
[505:30.14]You appeared to be supporting an 80s Wall Street businessman getup.
[505:34.14]As this was happening, the chat was watching all this.
[505:37.52]They were collectively agreeing with each other that you went too far and that you truly were a psycho.
[505:45.21]I managed to escape and had a talk with your dad He said he always knew this day would come and that you were a problem child the chat spammed lore That's just strange enough to be real
[506:13.46]That's a- this is a copypasta.
[506:21.32]You- your dream created an actual new copypasta.
[506:26.22]Especially the end.
[506:26.91]That's the perfect copypasta ending.
[506:34.45]Hey Keith, King, Crimson, thanks for the 250.
[506:39.67]Hey, if you're gonna play Beautiful Katamari for 360, you should grab all the DLC levels too.
[506:43.01]The game's a bit short.
[506:44.51]Yeah, I was gonna get everything.
[506:46.03]As much as I could.
[506:50.88]Paste it.
[506:55.22]Hold on.
[506:55.72]Let me paste the copypasta.
[507:04.18]I've reached the character limit.
[507:06.87]You cannot cheer in your own channel.
[507:08.73]Well, I'm not trying to.
[507:09.62]Alright, guys.
