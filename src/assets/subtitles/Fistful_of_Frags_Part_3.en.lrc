[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.86]I am back.
[00:10.96]Fucking Comcast.
[00:14.48]No, it wasn't Comcast.
[00:15.40]It was me.
[00:18.38]Let's switch this to Fistful of Frags.
[00:26.93]Yeah, just refresh.
[00:29.71]Facecam's going off for the night, by the way.
[00:32.34]You don't need to see me blushing and my funny looking face.
[00:47.08]It's time to pass some whiskey for like an hour or two before I go to bed.
[00:58.36]Yeah, it's like just, it's a process because you have to change the screen you're on and OBS.
[01:03.36]Hey, now I can actually hear notifications though.
[01:06.54]That's a good thing, right?
[01:14.97]Facecam, please.
[01:16.63]No, no facecam.
[01:17.81]No facecam.
[01:21.37]All my facecam juices have turned off.
[01:27.18]I don't have any more facecam juice.
[01:31.56]Well, hey, I can actually read chat.
[01:33.34]Isn't that something?
[01:36.34]Fistful of Frags.
[01:39.62]Thursday is going to be Binding of Isaac.
[01:43.20]The new Binding of Isaac expansion came out.
[01:44.58]I'm going to play it.
[01:45.42]I'm going to try to unlock the dumb things that I accidentally deleted.
[01:47.81]Because I'm an idiot.
[01:59.85]Don't want to reach out.
[02:02.03]Is Kim here now?
[02:02.83]No, she's not.
[02:04.75]She is not.
[02:17.40]You guys are fucking awesome.
[02:21.44]Fistful of Frags.
[02:25.78]Yeah, sorry about that.
[02:31.38]And away we go.
[02:32.14]Let me move this over here.
[02:40.70]Oh, if I got to change this to... What am I going to change?
[02:42.46]Wii U Boxing Champion has to change to... What am I going to name the stream right now?
[02:52.10]Six Shooter.
[02:52.92]Oh, God.
[02:53.28]What did I just do?
[02:53.92]I just opened up two Windows tabs.
[03:06.11]Western shooty.
[03:07.76]Whatever.
[03:08.06]I'll just fistful.
[03:18.20]Okay.
[03:21.52]Thanks for sticking around, guys, through all that.
[03:24.18]Hope you enjoyed.
[03:26.54]Oh, you're not supposed to see this.
[03:28.12]You're not supposed to see this.
[03:28.90]I don't want you to see what server I'm going into, right?
[03:32.08]Oh, who cares, right?
[03:35.00]This one.
[03:45.43]Yeah, if you haven't... Although, I'm saying to refresh the page to people that haven't refreshed the page.
[03:51.23]They probably aren't going to see it.
[03:53.77]Let's do some Wild West.
[04:05.14]Did Fistful of Rags get updated?
[04:06.40]I think it got updated, like, yesterday.
[04:07.82]They added Steam Workshop support.
[04:10.78]Which I should have... I think this is going to hit me.
[04:18.19]Nobody has a sharps rifle.
[04:20.66]Oh, where's Star?
[04:24.20]Star did not want to play.
[04:27.16]He said he wanted to play, like, earlier, but he didn't want to play now.
[04:35.55]Oh, I can turn this off, too.
[04:37.61]Oh, it's so much colder, and it's going to be so much cooler in this room now.
[04:40.78]Wait, what?
[04:52.21]Boo, boo.
[04:53.97]He was tired.
[04:54.89]I think he was eating and he was tired or something.
[04:57.61]I don't know.
[05:01.03]Damn it.
[05:03.45]I think you couch philanthropist.
[05:05.85]Middleman.
[05:06.55]Alright, hold on a second.
[05:07.41]The middleman subscribed for 15 months in a row.
[05:11.70]Did I get to see my MLG grandpa for the holidays?
[05:15.28]Actually, I did.
[05:17.02]I did sort of.
[05:20.80]Shit.
[05:28.56]But thank you for the 15 months in a row.
[05:29.95]That's the longest subscribers to this channel.
[05:34.41]It's a long time, man.
[05:35.19]Thanks.
[05:37.15]So glad I can actually hear notifications.
[05:46.36]I'll just kick you like three times.
[05:47.48]I don't care.
[05:51.66]Oops.
[05:56.34]What?
[05:58.00]Turn it down.
[05:58.81]Is it too loud?
[06:02.59]It actually probably is a little loud.
[06:06.69]That's probably better.
[06:12.13]That might be too low.
[06:14.60]You guys let me know.
[06:22.20]No!
[06:22.78]Another throw and I just got it.
[06:23.78]Thank God.
[06:30.27]Soft.
[06:30.57]A little too soft.
[06:38.73]Come on, bullshit.
[06:39.73]Now it's too soft.
[06:41.98]This is the problem with the Source Engine.
[06:44.56]Look at where this game volume is.
[06:46.82]From here to here is insane.
[06:50.66]Don't even tell me what happens when I put it up there.
[06:52.12]I don't know what's with the audio on Source Engine games.
[06:58.03]It's just fucking so loud.
[07:04.12]You have to be at, like, 1%.
[07:05.16]Hey, left side of town, thanks a lot.
[07:12.69]For the 11 months.
[07:16.73]Do it.
[07:17.19]No.
[07:19.51]I'm not gonna do that.
[07:20.61]Someone's gonna be just hanging out on the screen, not even knowing what they're talking about.
[07:26.03]And I'm gonna blow their eardrums out.
[07:29.11]See, now it's, like, too loud.
[07:36.00]I feel like that's gonna be perfect.
[07:49.07]No!
[07:56.82]Fucking hell.
[08:00.32]This is not punch out, you're right.
[08:01.56]This is fistful frags.
[08:17.66]Oh, I got him in the face.
[08:18.80]Cool.
[08:25.89]I'll see you later, Kim.
[08:27.97]Thanks for coming to the stream, Kim.
[08:29.29]Everybody say bye.
[08:33.63]Say bye to Kim.
[08:34.68]Seven out of ten needs more Kim.
[08:38.44]You know?
[08:41.58]I'll talk to you soon.
[08:59.66]I'm gonna be a good teammate.
[09:04.50]Okay.
[09:08.18]We can't just camp in here, man.
[09:09.42]We gotta go.
[09:24.35]I love this game.
[09:28.41]I don't want to be able to... I need whiskey.
[09:34.35]Yeah, this is pretty much like the Kim stream.
[09:38.25]I was playing Punch-Out and then I just got really embarrassed and shy.
[09:42.07]I don't know why I'm embarrassed.
[09:50.18]I'm just one of those weirdos.
[09:52.60]You guys know me.
[10:06.08]How did I not get that kill?
[10:10.59]Put the gun back in the holster?
[10:13.73]Thank you, Foober Booper and Mexican Tea Radio.
[10:18.09]Mexican Radio for two months.
[10:19.95]Goodbye, stars almost lovable.
[10:25.01]What?
[10:28.07]But thank you, unit, for the ten bucks, man.
[10:29.69]Appreciate it.
[10:31.01]And again, I do want to reiterate this again.
[10:34.88]I'm very sorry that if people gave... I'll try to check back and see who gave money.
[10:40.90]But I couldn't hear it and I couldn't see it.
[10:42.60]Let's... I'm switching it up.
[10:44.06]Fuck this.
[10:53.43]Oh, I got... Did I just get instantly killed by getting kicked?
[11:02.93]I need to warm up before I can play this game.
[11:05.54]I need my warm up rounds.
[11:19.15]Did I meet Kim on Tinder?
[11:20.53]No.
[11:21.49]No.
[11:23.17]I told you guys.
[11:24.15]I gave that shit up a while ago.
[11:31.55]I have not used that in a long time.
[11:42.12]Come on, show your face.
[11:47.00]I want to play on one of the terrain maps.
[11:48.07]Those are my favorites.
[11:49.99]This map is eh.
[11:51.97]I've played this map so many times that it just bores me at this point.
[11:57.49]Jesus.
[12:01.84]Convince Star to come back?
[12:02.78]I tried.
[12:03.34]I was like, come on.
[12:04.14]He's like, no.
[12:16.87]I remember the day of that tweet.
[12:25.15]Let's go for it.
[12:31.00]Go away.
[12:32.28]That's my ping.
[12:38.21]Is my ping good?
[12:39.03]I feel like I'm missing shots I shouldn't be missing.
[12:42.05]I hate this map.
[12:43.01]Again.
[12:43.69]Let's make that very clear.
[12:44.67]I fucking hate that place.
[12:49.41]Thank you, Running Crow.
[12:52.01]Thank you, Bizcasual and Quinton Harlan.
[12:55.27]Thanks a lot, guys.
[13:05.45]Hmmm. Knives.
[13:10.45]He fucking hates it. He hates that place.
[13:17.45]Orc song?
[13:25.45]I nealy died in one hit.
[13:39.60]20 seconds are long over.
[13:40.50]What was I waiting 20 seconds for?
[13:41.82]Whatever.
[13:48.02]He's reloading that rifle.
[13:50.27]There's so much smoke, I can't even see where the hell this guy is.
[14:02.26]Say my catchphrase.
[14:06.86]Ding dong!
[14:11.75]No, I gotta say my catchphrase when I get a guy here.
[14:16.34]Hey!
[14:24.24]Ding dong!
[14:31.15]What?
[14:31.67]Oh.
[14:37.83]How about a movie stream for Kim?
[14:45.49]Studio laughter.
[14:57.96]Bow?
[14:58.44]Bow.
[14:58.90]Yeah, we'll go with the bow.
[15:01.34]Why not?
[15:11.32]What the fuck?
[15:13.48]Oh.
[15:14.30]That was a warm-up.
[15:28.39]Bow might not be the greatest thing to use in a free-for-all.
[15:31.47]But, whatever.
[15:32.07]Who cares?
[15:43.81]Don't do it.
[15:44.67]Don't kill me.
[15:48.43]He killed me.
[15:50.25]No, no, no, I don't want it.
[15:52.47]I don't want it.
[16:02.09]What just even hit me?
[16:04.95]Oh my god.
[16:06.71]I can't fucking do anything right now.
[16:43.51]Didn't it feel like that guy died in a really laggy way?
[16:45.95]I don't know.
[16:47.81]Something doesn't feel right.
[16:49.68]Maybe it's my CL interpret.
[16:55.06]My CL interpret is not the right thing.
[17:16.02]No, just get out.
[17:16.64]There's too many.
[17:17.16]There's like five people over there.
[17:35.69]No!
[17:37.51]Every time you turn around, there's another guy.
[17:39.11]There's another guy.
[17:40.55]Alright, I gotta do something else.
[17:43.09]I'm just gonna run around with the hatchet.
[17:44.33]Forget that, man.
[17:52.05]I don't know what happened to that guy.
[17:58.43]Free-for-all is just so fucking crazy.
[18:01.11]Hey, Sam.
[18:01.81]Thanks for the five bucks.
[18:03.23]That one day you're gonna get the beatbox?
[18:06.69]One day you will.
[18:09.38]One day you will.
[18:12.86]But thanks for the five dollars, dude.
[18:28.58]You feel like Kim is a ghost haunting the stream?
[18:34.27]How did that not hit him?
[18:35.41]That went right through his body.
[18:36.89]I'm actually not doing that poorly.
[18:44.88]As poorly as I am.
[18:47.94]It's not that bad.
[18:58.80]Alright, I'll take it.
[19:00.48]Did he drop a hatchet too?
[19:04.16]Oh, what am I thinking?
[19:05.89]Don't think like that, man.
[19:11.01]No.
[19:13.35]No.
[19:20.29]Didn't know anybody still played this game.
[19:21.48]It's kind of just like a classic.
[19:28.33]It's a very, very fun game.
[19:40.71]Clown car when?
[19:43.79]Soon.
[19:44.65]I can't tell you how soon, but definitely soon.
[19:48.17]Soon enough.
[19:54.63]Thank you, quiet user.
[19:55.85]It's making you want to...
[19:58.98]Step it up, I'm trying.
[20:02.16]It's hard to step it up in a three-for-one.
[20:05.07]Getting more than like four or five kills in a row, like streaks, is not easy to do.
[20:09.55]Maybe for some people, but not for me.
[20:24.07]It also doesn't help that we're all like the same dude.
[20:59.12]Got them both.
[21:01.42]You want me to step it up?
[21:02.64]Fine.
[21:03.94]Stepped it up.
[21:06.12]You want me to step it up?
[21:07.16]I'll step it up.
[21:07.64]Fine.
[21:14.14]Let's see it.
[21:16.00]Hey!
[21:17.06]No!
[21:19.16]No!
[21:20.36]No, I just got it!
[21:21.30]I just got it.
[21:24.36]I just got it.
[21:25.08]Ah, it's too hard.
[21:37.13]This... The same guy fell down the stairs five times.
[21:44.78]It's too slow.
[21:46.16]Give me the Volcanic.
[21:47.26]Right-handed Volcanic.
[21:48.16]Shit's too slow.
[21:49.66]You got to go for a fan and a hammer here.
[21:52.54]You can't be spinning the thing around in your left hand.
[21:54.64]It's not going to work.
[22:02.75]There's a Red Turcon taking the pump over the Walker.
[22:05.47]I just hit it, but I was just so scared I was going to die.
[22:09.45]I pressed like a random button.
[22:11.19]Did you get those too?
[22:19.45]That's not fair.
[22:36.98]Oh boy, get off the train.
[22:39.99]Oh!
[22:41.05]Oh!
[22:42.55]There's so many people around.
[22:44.82]I get so nervous.
[22:45.74]That guy's got a shotgun.
[23:00.54]Huh?
[23:00.98]I'm getting really confused.
[23:11.08]Confused is the right word.
[23:12.06]I should have hit that guy Stop loading it stop loading it like it's so annoying when you're just trying to stop Beer
[23:38.97]What is happening?
[23:40.07]I'm out of here.
[23:43.83]Something was not right.
[23:45.85]I promise you.
[23:46.47]Let's go here.
[23:57.44]Walk and reload is garbage.
[23:58.78]Yeah, I just wish you could make it stomp.
[24:09.03]Let's go with Volcanic.
[24:11.31]Quitter?
[24:14.41]You could say that.
[24:23.86]Am I mad right now?
[24:26.33]No.
[24:42.31]Not really.
[24:44.71]Is this a payload map?
[24:45.65]If it is, this is unbelievable.
[24:46.75]Why does nobody play this?
[24:52.86]Is it?
[24:53.10]I gotta figure out where the hell I am.
[24:56.40]No, I guess not.
[25:03.22]You just watch all the movie streams and never laugh so hard.
[25:05.96]That's seriously the funniest game I think I've ever played in my life.
[25:10.78]That's like the best game ever.
[25:17.78]Stream is late and starts around 21 hours and 4 minutes.
[25:34.43]Never played this mode.
[25:35.29]I played, like... The permanent death one.
[25:40.98]I guess this is not that one.
[25:44.90]Are you angry?
[25:51.24]I've never played this map before, that's for sure, but... I guess that means I have never played the game mode then.
[25:58.11]So, yeah.
[25:58.61]I've never played the game mode.
[25:59.45]That's just why I'm walking around in circles over here.
[26:10.33]What's better?
[26:10.79]Movies or... Movies is the best game.
[26:14.11]Movies is by far, like, one of the greatest video games I've ever made of all time.
[26:23.52]I'm just going in.
[26:24.04]Whatever.
[26:24.36]Screw it.
[26:34.92]What am I stuck on?
[26:40.82]Don't get stuck.
[26:42.32]No, we won.
[26:45.12]I have played this game mode.
[26:46.68]I played the control capture one, haven't I?
[26:58.85]Would you put, like, gold in here?
[27:04.43]This is like a payload.
[27:05.25]It's like, uh... What was that one in TF2 with the two payloads going?
[27:10.04]Night... Land, whatever it's called.
[27:11.74]There's a guy.
[27:23.71]You are out of the buy zone.
[27:29.14]It's called Acid Base.
[27:29.98]That's the soundtrack to the movies.
[27:39.09]Nightfall.
[27:39.59]Yeah.
[27:39.85]What did I say?
[27:40.29]Nightland?
[27:42.77]Look at all... Ooh.
[27:45.69]I want this.
[27:49.37]Otto is a great dog.
[27:50.83]Except he kind of stinks.
[27:55.62]There's only one problem with my dog.
[27:57.08]He smells.
[27:57.66]He smells a little.
[28:00.10]Not a lot.
[28:01.42]I brush his teeth.
[28:02.11]He just has a smelly dog breath.
[28:07.77]Nothing I can do about it.
[28:11.83]I brush that damn dog's teeth like a human.
[28:24.15]Oh, where...
[28:26.77]Where did I get hit from?
[28:33.75]There's probably no health on this map, maybe, because it's perma.
[28:40.91]Come on, show your face.
[28:47.87]Damn it.
[28:50.96]Need to floss and mouthwash the dog?
[28:55.52]Smells better than you.
[29:05.65]Co-op bank robbery mission?
[29:09.67]Okay, gonna have to check that out.
[29:13.15]Co-op bank robbery mission sounds like it could be pretty fun.
[29:24.41]Let's go.
[29:26.75]Doggy dentures.
[29:37.86]See, I'm not... Where's my... This is the type of weird shit I was talking about.
[29:42.12]Where's my crosshair?
[29:48.92]Am I going crazy?
[29:52.32]I don't have a crosshair.
[29:59.43]Okay.
[29:59.67]Let's go somewhere else.
[30:16.02]I need to find like a server that I want to like stay in.
[30:19.71]Nest Sweetwater.
[30:24.39]Let's go.
[30:24.83]This is winter long.
[30:25.59]This one's cool.
[30:26.91]Crazy streamer.
[30:28.73]I'm kind of crazy.
[30:37.07]Cripple Creek, Cripple Creek.
[30:39.13]That's like the best map in the game.
[30:45.20]Oh, Cripple Creek.
[30:52.34]Ragequit.
[30:59.00]I'm starting to think you're mad right now.
[31:04.40]Thank you, unit, for the 10 bucks.
[31:05.94]Don't worry, you can't hit anything with or without a crosshair anyways.
[31:11.19]Oh, listen to that, Jess.
[31:12.57]Yeah!
[31:14.47]Hiding behind the truck.
[31:15.21]Oh, can't hit anything without a crosshair, huh?
[31:17.71]Just hit every single shot.
[31:18.95]Every single one.
[31:20.57]Didn't miss once.
[31:24.35]Now I did.
[31:42.82]Excuse me.
[31:43.56]Excuse me.
[31:44.08]Both of you.
[31:54.40]Careful now.
[31:56.60]I need health.
[31:57.96]Please don't come in here.
[31:58.98]Please, please, please don't come in here.
[31:59.98]Please, please, please, please, please, please.
[32:09.47]I'll now proceed to eat my cowboy hat.
[32:11.15]No shooting.
[32:13.69]Thanks, dude.
[32:14.95]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[32:17.66]Thousand bits.
[32:23.35]Two health.
[32:23.77]I'm so in trouble here.
[32:30.53]Get me out.
[32:33.35]Get me out of here.
[32:34.83]Where do you keep the booze?
[32:42.16]Come on.
[32:45.14]I gotta get to 10.
[32:49.10]Too drunk, too drunk, too drunk.
[32:56.84]I'm so nervous right now.
[32:58.81]Shit like that is why.
[33:16.18]Don't.
[33:16.64]Please.
[33:17.00]He got me.
[33:21.66]Doesn't matter how many times I say please.
[33:23.78]I still get killed.
[33:24.80]They still get me.
[33:37.14]Try that again.
[33:42.30]Right when I found him, I get knocked down.
[33:46.14]Oh well.
[33:55.01]He's got a rifle.
[34:02.00]Now I have a rifle.
[34:03.88]No I don't.
[34:06.93]I'm dead.
[34:07.19]3, 2, 1!
[34:09.79]What?
[34:11.25]Alright, two guys on my team.
[34:13.93]Don't scare me like that.
[34:14.89]Shit, he hit me right in the head, didn't he?
[34:29.65]Go, go!
[34:32.39]Pass the whiskey.
[34:35.36]I'll take it.
[34:37.02]The guy with that bow is fucking really good.
[34:45.32]Damn.
[34:54.02]He's demanding a full body germapillow.
[35:02.51]I don't know why it's making me laugh so much.
[35:06.29]What the fuck would that just be, like a picture of my face?
[35:17.02]Too many people on your team?
[35:20.06]Hey, is this a joke stream?
[35:24.90]No, no, this isn't.
[35:25.78]It was.
[35:26.40]Hey, welcome to the joke stream.
[35:33.88]Have fun.
[35:43.97]5-2.
[35:44.69]I'm not 5-2.
[35:46.27]I got out of that so... I don't know how I made it out of that alive.
[36:00.56]Oh well.
[36:05.54]That body pillow would only come up to my chest.
[36:16.64]Jokes are coming.
[36:17.40]Quick, give hundreds of dollars.
[36:19.02]You don't have... Well, speaking of... Speaking of money, there were some people that gave some money.
[36:28.07]Skippy Squeeze was subscribed for six months.
[36:30.43]They say, hi, what's going on, Skippy?
[36:33.41]Ball as well.
[36:36.97]Mercury Tango, thanks for the sub.
[36:38.39]AbsurdMonkey34, corn on the rob for 11 months.
[36:40.30]They say three.
[36:43.39]Three, well, you've been subscribed for 11, but thanks, dude.
[36:47.77]Ironic waifu for nine months.
[36:49.89]Pass the whiskey, pass the whiskey, pass the whiskey.
[36:53.11]Pass it, man.
[36:53.81]Thanks for the nine months.
[36:55.51]Running Crow, Biz Casual, Quentin Harland.
[36:56.99]I think I got these guys already.
[36:59.47]But thanks a lot for your new and old subscriptions, your continued subscriptions.
[37:02.55]Thanks a lot, guys.
[37:03.81]You guys fucking rock.
[37:14.33]There's a lot of people in this server.
[37:16.07]That guy just hammered me.
[37:26.95]What's the status on the book?
[37:28.81]The number is at least 6-4.
[37:29.65]I've seen it in the Madison Square Garden.
[37:33.26]Yeah.
[37:33.80]Yeah.
[37:35.32]I'm at least 6-4.
[37:45.09]That was going to be one of us and it was him.
[37:48.19]Get knives.
[37:48.71]Actually, thank you for reminding me.
[37:49.83]I really should.
[37:54.71]Should also put on the skull field and... I don't know.
[38:00.03]Forget about the boots.
[38:06.98]Forget about... No knives right now.
[38:08.70]I never use them.
[38:11.60]That was unfair.
[38:12.60]Spawned.
[38:12.98]Turned the quarter.
[38:19.32]Already at 34 health.
[38:21.24]But... What?
[38:24.15]And there's two of you over here?
[38:30.25]Can we get a picture of you and a banana for scale?
[38:35.84]You guys.
[38:39.50]What the fuck?
[38:42.66]I'm big and strong.
[38:46.44]I just died inside of somebody.
[39:00.31]Took his rifle.
[39:01.17]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[39:04.37]This is a good spot to be, though.
[39:05.35]As long as I don't screw it up somehow.
[39:12.28]Which I probably will, because I always do.
[39:14.34]Nice try.
[39:16.12]You almost had it.
[39:25.05]Nice try.
[39:34.23]Where are you?
[39:35.61]And I'm dead.
[39:37.07]No, I'm not.
[39:41.71]Two health, I can... I should have got up on higher ground.
[39:56.17]What a camper.
[39:57.85]Jeremy, YouTube misses you.
[39:59.51]I've got lots of YouTube plans for 2017.
[40:04.29]There are at least, like, four large-scale videos that are going to go up over the next year.
[40:09.86]And I'm very, very excited to do them.
[40:16.12]So don't worry.
[40:19.28]You will see more video format this year, for sure.
[40:37.88]He had really good aim from being down there.
[40:41.90]What happened to Punch Out?
[40:42.60]I got to Mr. Sandman and quit the game.
[40:48.64]That's pretty much what happened.
[40:58.36]Four videos in a year.
[40:59.32]There's the consistent videos that I... Yeah, but these videos are all going to be like... Potentially like $10,000 each.
[41:07.23]You're gonna get like $45,000 worth of videos in 2017.
[41:10.78]You know what I'm saying?
[41:21.55]Like, think of it that way.
[41:33.03]It's like, who do you turn?
[41:33.75]You're rocking a hard place.
[41:35.11]Do you fight the guy with the rifle shooting you or the guy shooting you in the back behind you?
[41:45.48]$40,000.
[41:46.40]Dermot, no.
[41:47.08]Dermot, yes.
[41:47.68]This is the year of like $10,000 jokes.
[42:03.74]Make him in the movies.
[42:04.64]That'd be fucking awesome.
[42:14.73]300 videos that cost 30 cents each.
[42:23.27]How did I die?
[42:24.75]Okay, a gust of wind just blew me off.
[42:30.73]Like a 75 mile per hour wind just knocked me off that roof.
[42:33.43]That wasn't even a guy.
[42:40.28]Still, what?
[42:42.00]It disappeared.
[42:42.52]Oh, God.
[42:54.77]When's the Kickstarter?
[42:55.63]I don't think I'm ever going to do a Kickstarter.
[43:01.34]I don't think so.
[43:04.04]The same guy that's the fucking wind keeps blowing me over.
[43:11.57]I would only probably consider doing a Kickstarter for a video project if... if I actually really needed like a hundred thousand dollars to make like... Glue Man the animated series.
[43:25.83]Whoops, I shouldn't have said that out loud.
[43:29.41]That's something that I want to do.
[43:31.23]Whoops.
[43:31.65]Probably should stop talking now.
[43:37.31]There's a lot of things I want to do.
[43:42.34]As you guys know, I have fucking dozens of things that I want to do.
[43:46.84]Which ones are gonna... Gonna happen?
[43:49.82]That's who knows.
[43:56.24]Yeah.
[44:01.31]Blue Man Anime?
[44:03.11]Kind of.
[44:03.47]There you go, one little rabbit!
[44:13.38]The same guy.
[44:14.22]Free.
[44:15.10]Thanks for the free points.
[44:21.08]Literally dozens.
[44:23.64]Where did I come from?
[44:25.72]Where did you go?
[44:26.36]Where did you come from?
[44:27.83]Caught in there.
[44:42.31]Galuman's Bizarre Adventure.
[44:46.89]No, it would be like a Marvel series.
[44:50.37]They'd be like villains and stuff like that.
[44:51.77]And he'd have to fight crime in the city.
[44:53.32]And make up a city where he is.
[44:57.74]They'd be like sidekicks and stuff like that.
[45:06.92]He'd get into trouble with the law.
[45:09.41]And then the law would have to end up helping him.
[45:10.99]It's going to be very tropey and very cliche.
[45:20.39]Shit.
[45:27.30]Gloom and Origin story.
[45:28.42]Gloom and Origin story.
[45:29.48]He's just a guy with a funny looking head.
[45:43.09]Hey, thank you, Papsicle boy.
[45:47.49]Yeah, there is a new shirt coming in 2017.
[45:50.48]It's gonna be like this solar system shirt.
[45:59.54]Ashley is currently working on it.
[46:03.37]She just had to get in touch with somebody from Teespring.
[46:09.19]Because she had some questions about using certain photos and stuff and printing them digitally.
[46:14.65]And I was like, you know what?
[46:16.10]I'm just going to get you an email.
[46:18.58]And then Christmas and New Year's happened, so we haven't really talked about it since.
[46:26.46]SmoothCoffee911, thank you for the $5,000.
[46:32.60]50 bucks.
[46:33.82]Dropping, dropping cash.
[46:36.30]They say, make live action versions of your movies from the movie stream.
[46:44.17]Well, just for you guys.
[46:45.87]There is going to be like, a gorilla is just going to be raiding a book somewhere.
[46:51.00]Nobody's going to know what the hell it is.
[46:52.08]Except for like the handful of people that... Let's say like a video on YouTube gets like 3, 4, 500,000 views.
[47:01.48]There's probably only like four or five thousand people that have seen that.
[47:04.98]So, like, you guys will know what the fuck that is and everyone else will just be like, what are you doing?
[47:08.40]I don't get this.
[47:13.71]I already have the gorilla costume.
[47:16.47]So why wouldn't it be there?
[47:22.31]You guys are walking right by a walker.
[47:29.64]Alright, this is where I'm going to go on a string here.
[47:31.92]At least I hope I do.
[47:35.44]Get my kills all stealing.
[47:39.57]Stolen.
[47:39.99]Why am I shooting at these people?
[47:43.73]They're not... And I'm... No, no.
[47:45.49]I gotta... If the base game was on right now, you'd see the fucking pure hatred in my face.
[48:09.54]$100,000.
[48:09.58]What time does stream end?
[48:12.20]Probably not going to go for that much longer.
[48:13.38]I haven't really been able to plan very much stream content as much as I've wanted to over the last week and a half or so since Christmas.
[48:23.75]Just been out and about doing things.
[48:27.01]Going to places.
[48:28.21]Holiday stuff.
[48:29.29]You guys know how it is.
[48:30.93]I wasn't even here the whole last weekend.
[48:34.35]Somebody just exploded me.
[48:35.47]That's why I haven't been here.
[48:40.49]But, yeah, I do apologize.
[48:42.85]A lot of these streams in the last, like, week have been a couple hours, like, two or three hours long.
[48:52.08]And I'm going to continuously blame it on holidays.
[49:01.10]Did I play something earlier today?
[49:02.08]I played Punch-Up for, like, two hours just messing around.
[49:08.13]Thursday should be a good stream.
[49:09.37]I have a couple of ideas and a couple of plans for Thursday.
[49:14.69]You guys should like it.
[49:15.97]Hopefully.
[49:18.93]And then because of all the holiday stuff, I'll throw in a stream on the weekend.
[49:26.54]We'll get back into the swing of things.
[49:27.72]Don't worry.
[49:31.44]These streams are what keep me alive.
[49:36.38]Stick around, man.
[49:38.34]There's much more.
[49:47.17]Flustered for two hours.
[49:48.29]I was flustered for maybe like an hour.
[49:56.90]Hold on a second.
[49:57.94]Let me explain.
[50:02.86]You guys have ever been in a school play before?
[50:06.67]Anybody?
[50:08.07]Anyone in the chat?
[50:08.75]Like a drama program or a theater in college.
[50:11.05]Like a play.
[50:11.99]You ever been in a play before when you were a kid?
[50:16.59]And the whole time that you're in that, you know, the months for rehearsal of practicing, you have like one of the characters, you have a bunch of dialog, you have a bunch of lines, and you're ready to go.
[50:27.82]You can't wait.
[50:28.30]Every time you're at the practice, drama rehearsal, everything goes great.
[50:31.08]Your lines are perfect.
[50:32.45]Hey,
[50:33.05]you're on top of your game and then you find out that your mother's gonna go and then you find out that like a girl's gonna go that you know and you're like oh shit hold on there's people that are gonna be people are watching my stream that like fucking know me oh uh I forget all my lines because I know that they're here like knowing that somebody's watching that I'd like like for instance Kim if you're watching
[51:04.70]It's very like, oh, somebody's watching me.
[51:07.46]Somebody's watching me.
[51:08.48]I don't know why, but it's always been like that for me.
[51:18.02]That turned dark.
[51:18.82]What?
[51:19.00]It turned dark.
[51:21.40]Jerma is scripted.
[51:22.44]No, I'm very off scripted.
[51:26.57]I like being scripted on camera.
[51:36.26]I need a teleprompter.
[51:38.14]Yeah, I need a teleprompter to tell me what to do.
[51:44.44]2,000 people watching.
[51:45.28]Like, I know.
[51:46.02]Like, sometimes this stream gets like 3,000, 4,000 concurrent people watching it.
[51:49.68]But it's weird.
[51:50.67]It's different.
[51:52.21]It's different when it's like... It's weird.
[51:56.61]It's like when you know a person and you know that they're like, don't... Like, let's put it this way.
[52:02.23]This girl, this girl, Kim.
[52:02.97]Um...
[52:05.82]We just recently started talking and... You know... It's like... It's like, oh yeah, I do this thing.
[52:13.09]Hey Kim, wanna see a joke?
[52:16.27]Oh, I get it by the train!
[52:17.39]You know what I'm saying?
[52:18.69]It's just like... It's weird to, like, in quotes, perform... When you know somebody's watching.
[52:27.98]Because, like, I know you guys.
[52:29.38]Like, you guys have been around for a long time, but... It's, uh... Something about it's weird.
[52:36.43]I can't read it.
[52:36.89]There's no words on it.
[52:38.76]Get the chat teleprompter.
[52:46.86]Donation for your upcoming school play.
[52:49.48]Thank you, unit.
[52:53.18]I can't perform.
[52:58.56]Does that make sense, though?
[53:00.20]If it doesn't make any sense, then I'm fucking crazy.
[53:10.95]Mixing the outside world with Twitch is hard.
[53:14.79]It's me, your mother.
[53:20.31]You had dual walkers in that game?
[53:21.68]Holy shit, dude.
[53:25.44]Joke sucks.
[53:26.00]I wasn't telling a joke.
[53:26.92]I'm just trying to be real.
[53:44.92]Perform for me?
[53:48.60]Yeah, perform's not the right word.
[53:52.04]It's not like I'm doing like a big performance!
[53:55.76]Although sometimes maybe I am.
[54:09.63]Colt Navy, all you had was a Colt Navy?
[54:18.14]Yeah, you're crazy.
[54:31.25]You tried playing Fistful of Frags and you forgot how hard it was?
[54:36.62]Yeah, it is on another level, I think.
[54:38.92]I think that's why I like it, though.
[54:42.14]I don't think it's necessarily a hard game.
[54:45.38]It's a very deliberate game.
[54:51.53]Every single shot counts.
[54:54.00]And that's why I find it to be one of the best first-person shooters that I've probably ever played in my entire life.
[55:02.30]Bad whiskey, my favorite kind.
[55:16.30]Damn it.
[55:18.62]That Firewatch video?
[55:19.64]Yeah, that's another thing.
[55:23.12]If somebody came up to me on the street and was like, if I knew them, if I knew them well, they were like, hey, dude, yeah, I watched some of your videos.
[55:31.30]Oh, okay, cool.
[55:33.50]Yeah, the one with, like, your dick out, what was up with that?
[55:36.24]It was like, uh, I don't know, you kind of had to be there.
[55:42.10]No, why are you like blurring out your dick on camera?
[55:44.64]Nah, it's just... Not a big deal, man.
[55:46.26]I'm talking... I'm talking comedy.
[55:49.36]It's hard to like explain that to somebody.
[55:52.17]I need to hide and reload.
[56:07.06]Hope to see Jerma live on Broadway soon.
[56:08.70]Thank you so much, Coffee.
[56:14.98]But I want to do more videos like that.
[56:16.20]That's where I want to take the direction of the channel and everything.
[56:20.60]We've talked about this before, though.
[56:21.70]2017 is going to be the year of videos.
[56:26.61]I can't wait.
[56:28.35]I'm so ready to get back to fucking work, man, and just make a bunch of stuff.
[56:41.11]That was dumb.
[56:41.67]I shouldn't have done that.
[56:45.93]It's like meeting Peter Dinklage.
[56:54.48]Still in ninth place.
[56:55.44]Somebody is killing it right now.
[57:00.20]Watch out.
[57:06.97]Reload.
[57:08.97]Did I say 2007?
[57:09.27]Did I?
[57:14.89]Is there going to be another live-action Jerma Rumble?
[57:16.45]Yes.
[57:21.04]Only this time it's going to be bigger and better.
[57:27.04]The next one, here's the thing, like, every time we make one of those videos, it needs to be better than the last one.
[57:32.60]I get asked a lot, hey, how come, um, why won't you go back to, like, 2K14 and make, like, another, just upload another Jerma, like, Rumble, like, video?
[57:43.71]Well, because we made that last one.
[57:45.53]And... Like, I don't want to go, like, backwards.
[57:49.42]I'd rather go forwards.
[57:53.62]So, that live-action one was... You know, I spent some money on it.
[57:57.99]And it was cool.
[57:58.91]It was fun.
[57:59.55]And...
[58:01.25]The next one's going to be that, like, times two.
[58:03.97]I want it to be even more fucking ridiculous.
[58:06.21]Every time it's going to keep getting better until, like, we're eventually, like... I'm going to be the first person to go to Mars.
[58:12.03]And it's going to be Jerma Rumble Mars.
[58:14.57]Eventually.
[58:15.01]After, like, another three years.
[58:18.09]I'm Jerma drunk right now.
[58:19.13]No.
[58:20.95]Not at all.
[58:26.58]Out of ammo!
[58:38.54]Will Gabe ever get revenge on the pencil?
[58:40.17]I don't know.
[58:42.55]You'll have to wait and see.
[58:46.55]Actual wrestling boot.
[58:47.57]Yeah, but that was a boxing ring.
[58:49.87]We talked about it before, but... That ring was not designed for anyone to, like, fall on it.
[58:56.07]It hurt.
[58:57.37]That was like falling onto cement.
[59:05.60]Thank you, Sam, for the five bucks.
[59:08.04]Scripted videos are absolutely hilarious and you want to see more.
[59:12.71]Yeah, I want to make more.
[59:14.27]Actually, tomorrow.
[59:17.45]Tomorrow, my producer friend is coming over and we're going to write a bunch of shit tomorrow.
[59:22.83]That's my plan for tomorrow.
[59:28.47]And then in probably first week of February, we'll probably start shooting something.
[59:32.41]Whatever it is.
[59:34.44]Whatever we narrow it down to.
[59:38.43]Gotta have a real demon in the next rumble.
[59:45.85]I would love to do that, man.
[59:46.95]I'd love to get a live studio audience and, like, actually do it.
[59:51.53]Do it in front of, like, try to get, like, a thousand people in a room.
[59:55.47]Then do an actual, like, event.
[59:57.51]Wrestling event.
[59:59.79]It would be such a nightmare.
[60:01.45]What?
[60:01.61]Did I just... He's got two people.
[60:07.74]I thought that was a bug.
[60:10.98]Alright.
[60:11.90]Just like that.
[60:17.33]That would require a ton of logistics, though.
[60:23.03]Logistics that I'm not really capable of handling.
[60:26.45]I would have to hire a company to do that.
[60:30.54]Damn it.
[60:40.46]I would take time off just to go to that.
[60:44.92]Yeah, we'd serve, like, $2 beers, you know what I mean?
[60:47.35]Everyone just gets fucking trashed.
[60:53.05]And, like, there would be, like, a clause that, like, you'd have to sign something before you got in.
[60:57.55]And, like, all the wrestlers would have to sign something before we got in.
[61:00.17]Like, shit would be allowed to be thrown into the ring.
[61:05.24]Like, if, if, okay, if it is less than, uh, like, .2 pounds, you're allowed to throw it into the ring.
[61:13.48]No, that's fucking terrible.
[61:14.96]Don't do that.
[61:16.78]We're not doing that.
[61:18.92]We're putting, like, fucking batteries in this shit.
[61:25.86]Everybody has to sign a death waiver.
[61:29.14]Hey, you wanna come to Jerma Rumble live?
[61:30.56]Oh, yeah, you gotta sign a death waiver.
[61:34.74]pyrotechnics that are way too close to the audience.
[61:45.43]You know when Kane comes out in WWF and he does his move and the explosion happens and you can feel the heat even though you're in the bleachers?
[61:53.34]It's gonna be that times like 30.
[62:09.93]Jim Rumble on ice.
[62:10.97]It's just getting a bunch of people in ice skates.
[62:16.68]Could happen, like, me falling all down and shit, trying to wrestle.
[62:19.92]Not even ice skates, just, like, sneakers on an ice ring.
[62:22.96]That's a match.
[62:23.40]That has to be a match.
[62:24.32]I have to do that now.
[62:25.66]I absolutely have to 100% do that.
[62:27.26]Absolutely.
[62:28.68]One of the matches in the next, like, Jermania, like, live, is gonna be an ice skating match.
[62:33.80]Gonna be first to fall down loses.
[62:38.12]and like within 10 seconds like somebody just falls and it's like that's it match is over it's like oh we just move on it's like not even a good match ice skating fight and put ropes up on it too so it looks like it's you're trying to make it look like an ice ring I gotta write that down I gotta write that one down
[63:11.67]In the ocean.
[63:17.59]I love just talking about this shit.
[63:25.78]I like bouncing.
[63:26.66]Like people like saying random ideas and random stuff.
[63:30.42]Because there's a real time audience here that would be like, actually that would be kind of funny.
[63:33.86]Or that would suck, dude.
[63:35.16]Don't do that.
[63:41.59]You guys didn't even know about my magic show.
[63:46.49]Or did you?
[63:47.07]I don't know.
[63:47.65]I haven't done it yet and I don't think I'm going to.
[63:52.92]Kim knows about the magic show because she asked about it.
[63:55.64]She's like, what the fuck is all this stuff?
[63:59.32]I was like, oh, that's for a magic show that I was going to do on Twitch.
[64:05.88]Oh, this is like embarrassing.
[64:09.38]I have a bunch of, like, shitty magic kits for, like, little kids.
[64:13.82]And I was going to get, like, a magic magician.
[64:16.19]This is when they first, like, introduced that you could not play a game on stream.
[64:21.01]I was going to dress up in a magician outfit and just do them.
[64:27.87]Like, lay them out on the table and be, like, the great Jerma and fucking do a bunch of shitty magic tricks.
[64:38.82]It was so fucking hilarious and embarrassing, though, when she saw that.
[64:42.78]Okay, think about it.
[64:43.58]Think about it.
[64:43.88]You come over to somebody's house.
[64:45.60]And, like, you're... It's a girl, like, you know, boy type situation here.
[64:51.07]You're hanging out with them over their house.
[64:54.11]And you look down and you see... Hey.
[64:58.03]Why the fuck does this guy... This adult man have, like, five little kid magic show kits unopened?
[65:09.55]You know what was going through my head?
[65:11.09]Just like... Oh, how the fuck am I gonna... This is... This looks weird.
[65:17.78]This looks... This looks real weird.
[65:22.26]But I explained what it was.
[65:24.62]Now they're all just gonna go to my, um... My nephew.
[65:30.18]Oh, that's interesting.
[65:30.88]Oh, you have like a bunch of fucking little kid magic show shit under here.
[65:36.08]Yeah.
[65:39.82]I should do a magic show.
[65:51.71]I'm so overweight.
[65:53.63]I'm dead.
[65:54.19]One health.
[65:55.97]All I can do is just pray that I kill the guy with the shotgun when he comes in the door.
[66:02.56]Whiskey.
[66:08.30]Go!
[66:11.09]I gotta get rid of the... Yeah, I gotta... Just get rid of this.
[66:12.99]I don't want it.
[66:15.70]Too overweight.
[66:20.06]Ugh!
[66:22.74]Wasn't I going to try to bring Danny DeVito in for real?
[66:26.30]That would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[66:28.85]It's money I don't have.
[66:29.55]That would be a Kickstarter.
[66:30.97]There's your Kickstarter page.
[66:32.77]Hey guys, I want to do Jerma Rumble Live Action 2.
[66:34.79]This Kickstarter money, we need $200,000.
[66:37.59]It's not for the video.
[66:40.29]This has nothing to do with the production.
[66:41.61]This has nothing to do with hiring anybody.
[66:43.73]CGI.
[66:44.41]No, this Kickstarter is to get Danny DeVito to make an appearance at the Rumble.
[66:49.99]That's the whole point of the Kickstarter.
[66:57.24]I wonder if it would even be that much.
[67:04.88]Do it?
[67:05.18]No.
[67:06.30]I don't even know what it would be.
[67:07.26]There's no plans for that at the moment.
[67:15.70]the beer rumble.
[67:16.56]I also want to just, ah, there's a lot of things I want to do.
[67:23.64]And right now, I need Whiskey Bad.
[67:25.65]Oh, shit!
[67:30.09]He'll be like 50,000 bucks.
[67:35.01]And all he does, all he does, he comes in the way.
[67:38.41]And he just, like, slaps me in the face.
[67:41.47]Hard.
[67:43.38]Like, no cuts, no edits, no jokes.
[67:45.76]Like, he slaps me, like, as hard as he can in the face.
[67:48.26]And I fly over the top rope.
[67:49.82]And then he, like, flexes a couple times and I leave.
[67:57.98]Shit.
[68:00.38]Let's put on... I don't know why I feel like using the Smith Carbine right now.
[68:07.67]I don't know.
[68:09.93]Donation for plateau shoes?
[68:11.63]Well, thank you, unit.
[68:12.91]Thanks for the five bucks.
[68:17.19]Use the Colt Navy, don't be a wuss.
[68:18.39]I mean, using this is kind of not being a wuss, wouldn't you say?
[68:31.42]Can't even hit a guy without him paying attention.
[68:35.88]Broken back.
[68:40.78]Yeah, I'd have to talk shit about him before he came out, too.
[68:44.51]Like, I'd grab the microphone right before the rumble started and be like... Somebody would be like, the little man would be in the ring with me or something, and I'd be like, Oh, look at you, cool man, I think you're so tough, I think you're so cool, what do you think you are?
[68:55.02]Fucking Danny DeVito, huh?
[68:57.98]And here comes Danny DeVito!
[68:58.94]Like, then he comes out.
[69:00.12]And I'm, like, shocked, like Vince McMahon, that, like, oh my god face.
[69:03.50]And I'm terrified of him.
[69:08.74]Something along those lines.
[69:09.52]Couldn't they just join us?
[69:22.58]Yeah, they could just join us.
[69:23.46]I'm sure they will.
[69:28.45]I want to do that with two or three celebrities in a row.
[69:30.67]Danny DeVito is one, and then I get back in the ring after getting humiliated by Danny DeVito.
[69:37.54]And just, like, grab the mic again, start talking, and bring up, like, another random, like, celebrity, and then they come out.
[69:44.25]Like, oh, that was fucking crazy!
[69:49.17]Good thing, like... Who's, like, I don't know, do I know any other celebrity names?
[69:57.30]I don't think I do.
[69:59.34]Uh... Guy Pearce?
[70:04.20]Like, yeah, I say, like, oh, yeah, Guy Pearce.
[70:06.44]Yeah, that's the joke.
[70:07.80]Guy Pearce, apparently.
[70:10.28]Why is that the only other celebrity I could name?
[70:12.04]And then he's not even, like, a relevant celebrity.
[70:16.73]Yeah, like Ashton Kutcher or something just comes out.
[70:25.07]You're shooting at the wrong people.
[70:27.59]Harrison Ford.
[70:29.83]You're not gonna do it.
[70:32.03]Guy Fieri.
[70:33.35]Yeah, Guy Fieri comes up.
[70:36.63]Grabs the mic and just goes, oh, this is killer.
[70:38.49]And fucking bashes my brains in.
[70:41.76]And leaves.
[70:47.42]You don't know who Guy Pearce is?
[70:50.06]Memento, dude.
[70:50.64]That's one of the best movies ever made.
[71:04.04]Welcome to Flavortown.
[71:11.96]Yeah, he, like, just chokeslammed.
[71:14.40]I would want fucking Guy Fieri to be very good at wrestling for some reason.
[71:23.72]He's like, oh, he's just a dumb Food Network host.
[71:27.07]Oh, no, no, he's doing, like, Hurricane Ranas and chokeslams and powerbombs and stuff.
[71:30.47]He's unbelievable.
[71:31.43]He makes it to, like, the final two of the Rumble.
[71:35.62]In fact, no, fuck it.
[71:36.62]He wins the Rumble.
[71:38.06]He wins.
[71:39.72]You heard it here first.
[71:40.84]Guy Fieri is going to win the next Rumble.
[71:42.98]There you go.
[71:46.08]By the way, I'm just like... Somebody requested this.
[71:50.14]I'll go Colt Navy.
[72:02.43]Watch out.
[72:04.78]No, you spoiled it.
[72:05.58]That's also assuming that Guy Fieri... This is a pipe dream we're talking here.
[72:14.31]Guy Fieri's not going to be it.
[72:15.57]He's not going to do it.
[72:18.66]Oh my god, I hate this guy.
[72:35.89]You want Guy Fieri in the Rumble so bad now.
[72:44.75]I'm not one to die.
[72:45.43]I want to deal with you, not him.
[72:48.69]Too much going on.
[72:51.17]Ah, there's just everyone now.
[72:52.71]What was I supposed to do there?
[72:56.65]You went to go pee and now I'm getting Guy Fieri.
[73:06.65]It'd have to be like a clause or something that they sign.
[73:10.09]Saying that they have to promote like, the Triple Rumble on Twitter.
[73:15.41]How fucking funny would that be?
[73:17.07]Guy Fieri on his dumbass Twitter, however many people like... Alright, who follows Guy Fieri?
[73:23.77]For real.
[73:25.37]Think about that.
[73:27.97]Like, Guy Fieri's Twitter.
[73:29.57]What could you possibly want to know from Guy Fieri?
[73:31.62]I mean, Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives?
[73:34.78]It's not a bad show.
[73:37.84]I guess in the same realm, why would you follow me?
[73:41.48]Fuck, I'm no better than diners, drive-ins, and dives.
[73:43.36]I gotta change that.
[73:44.06]I'm having like an existential crisis right now.
[73:46.76]Get out of here.
[73:51.87]Hi to me.
[73:58.37]It's alright here, right now.
[74:00.89]On diners, drive-ins, and killer.
[74:15.91]2.2 million people follow him.
[74:17.37]Holy shit, how many people follow me?
[74:20.55]Like 60,000?
[74:20.99]Guy Fieri is like cooler than me.
[74:25.96]What do I do about this?
[74:28.08]He is though.
[74:28.96]Fuck, he really is.
[74:34.72]Existential crisis.
[74:39.28]Guy Fieri should be streaming, not me.
[74:47.50]He's a troll doll who travels and eats garbage That's fucking funny
[75:13.83]Thank you, unit, for the 50 bucks.
[75:15.41]Damn.
[75:16.89]You've been dropping mad money tonight, dude.
[75:20.78]5,000 bits again.
[75:23.08]Thanks a lot, man.
[75:25.72]No, I just like how he travels and eats garbage.
[75:31.18]I just picture a guy just driving around in this, like, what is it?
[75:34.09]Like, the 1920, like, Camaro or, like, a Cadillac or whatever.
[75:37.29]He's just eating out of people's trash.
[75:42.30]this week on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.
[75:44.82]And he's like in front of somebody's house.
[75:51.24]I'm at a killer spot on like West Stevenson Street.
[75:56.90]Checking out the local flavor.
[75:59.20]He's opening up the trash can.
[76:03.24]I kind of want to like make this.
[76:04.74]I don't know why this is making me laugh so much.
[76:15.23]And like that stupid music's playing in the background, that like... Oh, what's that?
[76:21.50]Oh, this is killer.
[76:22.22]He's like a fucking rotten, half-eaten burrito.
[76:27.26]Eventually, after like five minutes, somebody comes out of the house and is like, what the fuck are you doing?
[76:35.69]Guy Fieri going to different houses and eating out of people's garbage cans.
[76:41.54]That's fucking funny to me for some reason.
[76:53.24]This is killing me.
[76:56.31]Out of the park man.
[77:05.41]Can I play string like more than five together?
[77:14.35]Hey, ow.
[77:22.66]Thought I had that.
[77:28.28]Spawn, spawn killing.
[77:30.12]Spawn camping, come on.
[77:38.57]But the thing is, for that to be funny, that would actually have to be Guy Fieri doing that.
[77:44.46]To me, if you get a Guy Fieri impersonator, that's not funny.
[77:48.28]It actually has to be Guy Fieri.
[77:59.50]Coward!
[78:04.54]Oh god, you're locking me in.
[78:08.71]Why am I stuck here?
[78:10.29]Get me out of this.
[78:17.81]Give me the knife.
[78:19.35]Give me this.
[78:19.75]I don't have time to reload.
[78:24.67]Shoot.
[78:26.03]Shit.
[78:27.21]Shit.
[78:28.29]I could have reloaded like three times by now.
[78:29.95]What do you get?
[78:49.09]When's the full production of Clown in the Town that you wanted to do years ago?
[78:55.84]I wish it was done.
[78:59.00]That would have been so much fun.
[79:02.72]But a reality show type joke, like mock satire like that, for us to go into a city and do that, we would need a hell of a lot of permission.
[79:18.02]so much permission that we would need a company behind it.
[79:23.75]There would have to be somebody important enough to let us do that shit in the city.
[79:31.54]We need the mayor's son to set that up.
[79:36.40]I don't know the mayor's son.
[79:37.64]It's not going to happen.
[79:54.45]Fruit, yeah.
[79:58.72]Just make a company?
[80:03.06]No, I can't make a company.
[80:04.86]I'm not good at running a company.
[80:06.28]I'm not good at being a company man.
[80:16.31]Not knowing the mayor's son in 2017.
[80:17.57]I'm dead.
[80:22.28]Maybe not.
[80:24.24]Just hide, like, right here.
[80:25.72]Away from the company.
[80:26.26]He's going to come and try to get that gold chest.
[80:27.60]And I'm going to pop up.
[80:29.12]Pop up and die.
[80:41.51]Hey, Zem.
[80:43.49]More Twitch staff.
[80:47.11]Twitch staffers in here.
[80:48.11]Hey, what's going on, Zem?
[80:51.31]Thanks for hanging out.
[80:53.57]Watching us talk about Guy Fieri.
[80:57.33]How badly we want him to eat trash on camera.
[81:06.80]Ah.
[81:06.94]Alright, I'm probably going to call it a night after this.
[81:14.58]I want to prepare for Tuesday, uh, Tuesday, Thursday stream.
[81:20.54]We're gonna start something different on Thursday.
[81:25.71]An A-list celeb that just makes a career off of despising Guy Fieri.
[81:32.65]Getting Robbie Rotten.
[81:37.02]That would be fucking pretty cool actually.
[81:49.61]Magic show?
[81:51.06]No, Thursday stream is not the magic show.
[81:57.00]How about this?
[81:57.70]I'll do like a trick on Thursday for you.
[82:00.48]I'll perfect one of them.
[82:01.74]I'll do like a little magic show on Thursday.
[82:04.14]No, fuck it.
[82:04.49]I'm just going to do it.
[82:05.05]Who cares?
[82:05.47]I'm doing a magic show on Thursday.
[82:12.53]Fly him out from Iceland.
[82:15.89]I have a good... I have a good...
[82:27.33]I'm in no position to win any of these fights because 2v1.
[82:41.18]I need somebody for the magic show, though.
[82:44.20]There's one dumb thing in particular that I wanted to do.
[82:47.62]The one joke that I wanted to make requires a person.
[82:52.69]Two people.
[82:55.87]I'm missing these kicks.
[82:56.65]How am I missing these kicks?
[83:01.75]I know where Guy lives.
[83:03.55]Want me to go ask him?
[83:05.21]No, I do not want you to invade on Guy Fieri's privacy to ask him to be in this random streamer YouTuber's video.
[83:14.43]Probably just be like, what are you talking about, man?
[83:15.69]Get the fuck out of here.
[83:17.85]Slam.
[83:24.51]We're
[83:45.86]You're not killer enough I'm killer You're not killer enough This is so awkward looking down like that
[84:10.59]You've only experienced Guy Fieri through people talking about him on the internet.
[84:15.97]Oh, he does have 2.2 million followers.
[84:28.04]Get out of here.
[84:32.06]Get Owen Wilson.
[84:33.02]Wow.
[84:34.62]Wow.
[84:40.51]Wow.
[84:43.87]I would totally just love to be in the triple.
[84:46.75]Wow.
[84:47.53]I would love that.
[84:48.57]Oh, I love you.
[84:49.27]Did I do good?
[84:58.12]But thank you, unit.
[84:58.92]Unit, you have now passed $100 fucking dollars.
[85:18.89]Move, move, move, move, move.
[85:23.54]Oh, new voice.
[85:24.16]New voice.
[85:24.82]New voice.
[85:25.40]Am I going to do terrible games Saturdays?
[85:33.56]Yeah, I mean, I'll do it for a little while.
[85:35.29]I'll just do... The thing is, though, it's fine.
[85:38.71]Terrible games.
[85:40.97]There's a hard... As you guys have seen with Devil's Third.
[85:45.06]There's an in-between where a game is so bad and not fun that it just sucks.
[85:53.31]Nobody wants to see it and the game sucks.
[85:55.03]And who is hitting me all the way over here?
[85:56.29]I don't get it.
[85:58.10]That guy.
[86:04.02]There's a balance when you find a bad game that's fun to play.
[86:11.92]There was actually a scary game that I wanted to play today.

[86:28.43]It's like a Five Nights at Freddy's game.
[86:31.67]But it wasn't.
[86:32.13]It was like this weird bunny rabbit thing from what I could understand.
