[00:04.65]Start streaming... Oh, where did it go?
[00:08.85]Where did it go?
[00:09.41]It was just right here.
[00:11.51]Hello, everybody!
[00:18.98]There are the comments.
[00:19.86]Now I can see what you guys are saying.
[00:26.06]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[00:28.48]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[00:33.31]Yeah, I'm going to play some Binding of Isaac.
[00:35.75]Just setting some stuff up here.
[00:42.39]Put this out.
[00:47.66]Yay.
[00:50.74]And, hey, there we go.
[00:52.10]Now you can see.
[00:52.84]Go offline.
[01:01.88]And tweet it out.
[01:05.36]On the tweet.
[01:08.16]Twitter.com.
[01:12.10]There we are.
[01:16.96]I'm going to try and do some actual Binding of Isaac this time.
[01:20.06]Not the failed Binding of Isaac like I did last time.
[01:23.54]Because now, if you noticed, I have... I have a save file now that allows me to play.
[01:29.72]Look it, I got all the characters again.
[01:32.73]If you want to know how this happened, actually, I got this save file from MLC_St3alth.
[01:38.51]Because we all used to play this game all the time in Skype.
[01:41.60]And when he heard that I didn't have my save file anymore because of my corrupt hard drive, he said, you know what, just go ahead and take my save file.
[01:49.08]So, thank you to MLC_St3alth.
[01:52.56]Special shout out to you.
[01:55.29]But who are we going to play as is the real question.
[01:57.99]Which one, which one, which one, which one?
[02:00.63]I'm going to go with good old-fashioned Kane.
[02:04.48]Good old-fashioned Kane.
[02:07.86]Oh yeah, and yeah, I did not 100% this.
[02:10.53]This is MLC_St3alth save file.
[02:12.61]I got to like, I want to say, maybe 60 or 70% maybe.
[02:17.69]I played through a lot of times, but not nearly as many times as Stealth did.
[02:21.87]Because he, him and Boo, they both just destroyed this game.
[02:26.92]They're better at it than I am.
[02:29.74]But I'm sniffing at a really good playthrough here.
[02:33.26]Let's see, let's hope so.
[02:38.07]Alright, well that's open now.
[02:43.44]Can open any single door down here.
[02:45.96]That book.
[02:47.72]I need to get that.
[02:49.34]I need it.
[02:50.78]I need it so badly.
[02:54.80]But how's your Sunday going?
[02:55.84]Did I say Saturday in the beginning of this?
[02:57.60]I don't remember.
[02:58.24]But how's your Sunday?
[03:00.40]I'm actually sunburnt to hell right now, guys.
[03:05.05]I went to a beach and I wanted to get a little bit of color on me because obviously I was a pale, pale man.
[03:13.99]And I'm going to Seattle next week so I wanna, I wanna look good, right?
[03:18.94]I wanna look okay.
[03:20.74]So I went to the beach and I got the hell burnt out of me because I haven't been outside in like six years.
[03:25.30]That's a joke.
[03:32.44]Ow.
[03:34.22]You meatsickle!
[03:35.88]How dare you!
[03:40.44]Oh yeah, Dr. Pepper!
[03:43.83]Pepper, I keep seeing somebody wrote Pepper.
[03:48.13]Five poison bombs, I'm good with that, I'll take it.
[03:55.90]Absolutely gonna blow you up.
[03:57.02]Oh, maybe I shouldn't have done that!
[03:59.92]Was it worth it?
[04:01.44]A chest inside of a chest.
[04:03.67]And a fish head.
[04:05.87]Anybody know what the fish head does?
[04:10.39]Definitely going in here.
[04:13.17]What does this do?
[04:14.99]Telepathy for dummies.
[04:20.39]Oh, this just gives you that.
[04:21.65]Definitely taking the Book of Sin, for sure.
[04:25.97]I'll take free stuff over homing missiles any day.
[04:29.83]At least in my opinion.
[04:30.89]Is this the secret room?
[04:33.54]No, it's not!
[04:35.60]So where the hell is the secret room?
[04:42.16]Hmm, this is intriguing.
[04:48.67]Hopefully, somebody just asked if I was gonna do a tour of Valve in Seattle.
[04:52.01]I hope so.
[04:52.41]That would be really cool.
[04:55.93]Shibby's gonna be out there too, so... Maybe we can get some pictures of Gabe Newell.
[05:00.71]That'd be awesome.
[05:03.31]Let's just go take this boss out.
[05:04.60]I don't think, uh... Listen, the other secret room is either here, then.
[05:09.26]The thing is, I want that book.
[05:10.90]I'm gonna try it.
[05:12.98]I'm gonna go for it.
[05:14.90]Yes, I was right!
[05:17.02]And it's just a stupid slot machine!
[05:19.72]Thanks a lot, Billy, whatever your name is.
[05:23.48]Whatever, we're blowing it up.
[05:24.72]Money, come on, money!
[05:26.78]Oh, a pill!
[05:27.82]That's good for Kane!
[05:28.83]Ehhh...
[05:33.74]Kind of a waste, but it's okay.
[05:38.02]And those of you asking why I'm going to Seattle, PAX Prime.
[05:40.89]I'm going to PAX Prime.
[05:45.41]This guy's not the person I wanted to fight in the very beginning.
[05:49.73]You know what?
[05:50.15]We're doing this.
[05:51.61]No!
[05:52.29]That's not what I wanted!
[05:53.15]I only have one of those bombs left.
[05:57.02]I can't be careless here.
[05:58.94]I might die.
[05:59.46]I'm gonna die here.
[06:03.96]No, I want... Mmm, my plan is ruined.
[06:10.32]Duck and dodge, duck.
[06:12.11]Dodge!
[06:14.17]Wow, wow!
[06:17.59]Wow.
[06:18.77]Wow.
[06:20.87]I forgot, because this is, like, stealth save file, he has, like, the super hard mode.
[06:24.67]It's alright, I got him.
[06:28.31]I got him, don't worry, guys.
[06:31.69]And I got the cube of meat.
[06:45.12]Is there a super secret room in here?
[06:46.52]Because this is Wrath of the Lamb.
[06:51.47]I don't even have enough bombs.
[06:52.21]I don't even have any bombs to go look for a secret room.
[06:56.83]Let's keep moving.
[06:59.57]Do-do-do-do-do-do.
[07:02.10]Oh, you're all going down right now.
[07:08.02]Yikes.
[07:09.26]That was pretty close.
[07:14.29]My weekend's been pretty good.
[07:16.77]Hopefully your weekend has been just as good as mine.
[07:20.49]Can't complain.
[07:22.91]Cube of meat.
[07:23.53]When you get more than one cube of meat, you start to create Super Meat Boy.
[07:29.92]Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[07:31.16]Little Chad.
[07:33.36]Just drops hearts.
[07:35.58]I love you, Little Chad.
[07:36.78]Thank you, I love you too.
[07:40.87]Little Chad, where are we going?
[07:42.39]We're gonna go on an adventure together.
[07:44.67]Oh, that's great.
[07:45.53]Yeah, I know.
[07:48.15]Watch out for the mazicles.
[07:49.65]Watch out for the mazicles.
[07:50.51]I could have just killed both of them right there, but instead I'm gonna get nobody.
[07:58.00]Come here, you meat-chickle!
[08:03.06]Come here!
[08:03.74]Why can't I curve those?
[08:04.54]Oh, I'm stepping on the web, that's why.
[08:10.03]I got good feelings about this playthrough.
[08:11.51]If I could take on that boss, that means I'm of sound body and sound mind.
[08:24.20]Don't want to do that.
[08:26.04]Back out of that room for sure.
[08:28.79]Spiders.
[08:29.31]I hate spiders.
[08:31.23]If there's one thing I hate in this game, then you all know it.
[08:33.20]It is spiders.
[08:37.38]You know why I don't like spiders?
[08:38.88]Because they bite.
[08:40.82]They sting.
[08:42.82]They infect you with their fangs.
[08:46.26]They're just all kinds of bad.
[08:52.87]Speaking of Dr. Pepper, somebody said you must drink Dr. Pepper.
[08:56.17]Where is my Dr. Pepper?
[08:57.41]It's not even sitting right here.
[08:59.51]I should have at least two Dr. Peppers.
[09:02.87]At all times.
[09:05.00]I'd probably get pretty fat.
[09:08.54]Red patch doubles your fire rate, right?
[09:13.14]If I remember.
[09:15.50]I've been known to forget.
[09:21.07]Let's just... I'm going to take the red patch.
[09:27.21]And I'm going to go in here, too.
[09:29.49]Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[09:30.75]This is the best item in the game.
[09:32.57]Wait, what does this do?
[09:34.34]Monster manual?
[09:35.14]What does this do?
[09:38.80]Makes a pretty terrifying noise.
[09:41.80]Hello, Jerma.
[09:42.42]Am I reading the chat?
[09:43.18]Yes, I am.
[09:45.75]I don't think anything's better than the Book of Shadows.
[09:47.77]Invincibility is way better, in my opinion.
[09:51.35]Not gonna waste a key to go in there again.
[09:54.97]Hmm, secret room right here, or up top?
[09:57.31]That is the real question.
[10:03.37]Do I dare try it?
[10:04.47]I'm going for it.
[10:05.65]Whatever.
[10:09.79]It's alright, I got the Book of Shadows.
[10:15.93]Oh, I hate this son of a... I hate this guy.
[10:19.13]Just come here.
[10:19.83]Just stand right next to him and just kill him.
[10:21.27]Please just get all of his health down from this.
[10:23.90]Book of Shadows.
[10:25.12]Best item in the entire game.
[10:27.80]Like, seriously.
[10:29.52]You can't get much better than that.
[10:31.44]That was unbelievable.
[10:33.62]If I did not have the Book of Shadows right there, guys, guarantee loss.
[10:38.08]I cannot fight that boss to save my life.
[10:41.10]Oh, and look at all of these pills!
[10:43.50]Oh man, what's just one?
[10:46.88]All these are full health pills.
[10:49.44]Are you absolutely kidding me?
[10:52.03]Come on.
[10:56.33]You know what?
[10:56.73]I'm gonna do this.
[11:00.69]Does anyone know if I walk onto this if it hurts the spirit heart?
[11:06.44]If I walk over this, is it gonna take away my spirit heart?
[11:09.83]Anybody certain of that?
[11:14.95]Because I don't want to... So this will... If I walk over this, this will not take away my spirit heart.
[11:22.56]Just my regular hearts.
[11:24.10]Right?
[11:25.46]Boo!
[11:26.78]I'm calling, Boo.
[11:28.44]Hey, Boo Man.
[11:31.76]Alright, so... I'm gonna walk over this and just take all... I'm gonna just keep taking those pills and come back down.
[11:37.05]Sounds like a plan, right?
[11:41.49]Alright, so.
[11:41.99]Alright, let's do it.
[11:44.06]It does hurt the spirit heart!
[11:48.32]Oh, you know, might as well do it now.
[11:52.98]Oh, I'm... I'm so stupid.
[12:01.31]I can't believe I just did that.
[12:04.90]Because you know what, I asked the question, and I phrased it in a very weird way, so I understood it.
[12:12.52]I understood it as, yes, it will not hurt you.
[12:17.42]That's the kind of brain we're working with right here, my brain.
[12:23.30]Come on, give me something!
[12:26.14]Give me something!
[12:28.34]Give me something or suffer the consequences.
[12:31.82]Um, that's all I'm gonna do.
[12:33.98]I didn't get anything.
[12:34.64]Actually, there's hearts here.
[12:35.36]There are hearts here, scattered around.
[12:39.46]That was a super derp moment.
[12:41.10]Like, that was an ultra derp moment.
[12:43.90]Come on.
[12:45.04]Come on.
[12:47.19]You take a full heart.
[12:49.61]You gotta be kidding me.
[12:50.49]You're not gonna give me free stuff?
[12:52.03]I've taken away so much health from this thing.
[12:55.55]Come on!
[12:56.31]Are you serious?
[12:58.35]Now I can't do it anymore.
[13:02.59]Whatever.
[13:04.87]Whatever.
[13:08.31]Let's just go.
[13:08.79]Let's continue our quest.
[13:14.14]Let's continue our quest of The Binding of Isaac!
[13:20.50]Binding of Spikes, Wrath of Jerma.
[13:23.94]Let's do it.
[13:25.76]You ain't gonna get me, man.
[13:27.22]Where's your, like, gross puke bomb?
[13:29.12]How come you're not shooting the puke bomb?
[13:32.30]Bombs?
[13:33.04]Yes, I'll take these.
[13:34.44]That was sort of an anti-climactic mini-boss.
[13:42.73]Come here!
[13:43.27]Come here!
[13:45.37]Come here!
[13:48.24]That's the first dollar I think I've picked up.
[13:51.88]Whoa, this is bad!
[13:53.64]No, no, it's never bad.
[13:54.98]You have the Book of Shadow.
[13:56.86]What are you talking about?
[13:57.80]Now, all I need is the battery.
[14:00.02]And I am guaranteed to beat this level.
[14:01.86]This game.
[14:03.98]You get me the battery, game over.
[14:07.88]I will win this hands down.
[14:12.73]Spiders.
[14:13.33]Spiders.
[14:13.75]They got the spiders.
[14:14.69]Get rid of him.
[14:17.57]I don't want you puking out any spiders on my front lawn.
[14:23.70]There we go.
[14:25.91]Little Chad, you have been really, really good.
[14:27.93]Just dropping random hearts.
[14:29.25]I love you.
[14:33.69]Yeah!
[14:36.94]Bombs?
[14:41.40]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go to the next level.
[14:50.92]I don't wanna waste a key on that chest, cause I think I'd find something better.
[14:58.04]Hmm, item room or the book room?
[15:00.32]Definitely not the book room, cause I have the book of shadows, and I'm not gonna... Ah, yeah, you see what I did there?
[15:08.58]Come on!
[15:09.48]Somebody hurt me!
[15:10.60]Please, somebody try and hurt me, you're not gonna hurt me.
[15:13.78]You'll never hit me, you'll never hit my tiny head, I've got such a tiny little head!
[15:18.74]I don't want that.
[15:20.38]I'm going in the item room.
[15:23.70]I'm okay with this.
[15:24.52]I'm okay with this.
[15:28.10]That's my favorite scout line.
[15:30.02]You'll never hit me!
[15:31.52]I have such a tiny little head.
[15:35.72]Such a tiny head!
[15:36.68]Such a tiny little head!
[15:41.46]This is the secret room, and if it's not, I'm going to pee my pants.
[15:47.26]Alright, I'm peeing my pants.
[15:48.66]Here we go.
[15:51.52]God, this is disgusting.
[15:54.97]Well, I just peed my pants.
[15:57.89]So, why... Guys, I don't... I don't understand why I do these things.
[16:06.11]I have the spelunking hat on.
[16:09.45]I don't have to just guess where the room is.
[16:15.33]Seriously, man.
[16:17.89]I don't understand the things I do.
[16:20.04]I never will.
[16:22.24]Oh, no, I have to guess where the bomb is.
[16:24.14]Even though I have the thing that makes me see through doors.
[16:31.36]Oh.
[16:33.58]I think I have, like, heat exhaustion from the sunburn.
[16:36.16]I'm acting all weird.
[16:37.09]Alright, let's not go in there because I don't have a key.
[16:43.04]I can't believe I did that.
[16:48.38]Oh, goodness.
[16:51.60]Super secret room!
[16:56.42]Oh, yeah!
[16:59.16]Get me out of here!
[17:00.90]What was that?
[17:03.69]That was... That was nonsense!
[17:08.21]Super secret room, and it's a room with a chest full of spiders.
[17:13.49]Give me a break.
[17:15.19]It was not cool.
[17:18.57]The husk.
[17:19.68]Alright, husky.
[17:21.96]Oh, you spit out all kinds of stuff.
[17:23.24]Book of Shadows!
[17:24.02]I don't have it!
[17:24.60]I don't have it!
[17:25.12]I just tried to use it!
[17:26.00]I don't have it!
[17:26.54]Oh, god.
[17:29.68]Well, my confidence is gone!
[17:32.68]My confidence is all out the window now, guys.
[17:35.16]I don't have my guaranteed win item.
[17:39.53]I got my health, though.
[17:40.73]I'm good.
[17:41.63]Except I'm stuck in the corner, which is not a good thing.
[17:45.11]Okay.
[17:47.15]Good thing I had those pills, otherwise I would have screamed at the top of my lungs.
[17:54.28]Dog food!
[17:56.02]Extra health.
[18:00.02]Why am I all red?
[18:00.98]The red patch just, like, totally saved my life, didn't it?
[18:04.93]It really did.
[18:07.03]The red patch is the reason why I'm still playing.
[18:13.17]That's all I can do down here, I think, right?
[18:16.01]Oh, and this is gonna turn into a heart right now, isn't it?
[18:18.13]It has to!
[18:19.03]Yeah!
[18:20.62]Yes!
[18:22.44]Alright, we're good here.
[18:25.40]We're doing good here.
[18:26.12]We're doing good things.
[18:28.20]And the secret room is right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[18:31.68]Not a good place to be.
[18:34.64]The only problem with this playthrough so far is I don't have any, like, pluses damage.
[18:40.83]Or tears up.
[18:43.11]I don't really have anything, to be honest.
[18:44.83]I kind of have novelty items.
[18:46.19]I don't have any useful items.
[18:47.89]Well, I guess they are useful.
[18:49.41]In their own way.
[18:49.99]I'm getting stuck over here.
[18:52.49]That's not what I want.
[19:00.17]Get out of my face!
[19:06.55]What am I gonna... Oh, by the way, the rest of The Binding of Isaac playthrough, me sitting in this room trying to hit these guys...
[19:14.23]Let's go to the secret room.
[19:16.47]Hopefully there's something interesting in here.
[19:20.82]Oh, alright.
[19:22.34]Transcendence.
[19:24.88]Just a floating head.
[19:29.46]I'm okay with that.
[19:31.33]I'm okay with this.
[19:36.01]Go!
[19:39.49]Yeah, you aren't gonna shoot anything at me.
[19:43.25]Transcendence.
[19:47.17]Cave Story tonight, somebody asked?
[19:49.01]Probably not.
[19:50.05]I'm probably going to do Stew Binding of Isaac, to be honest.
[19:52.90]Usually a playthrough can take up to an hour and a half or so.
[19:56.14]We'll see how it goes.
[19:58.72]I do have to finish that Cave Story playthrough, though.
[20:01.99]That game's getting a lot harder.
[20:03.25]That game is getting pretty difficult.
[20:07.45]I've got to put on my try-hard pants next time I play that.
[20:15.10]What am I doing?
[20:15.58]I don't have to do that.
[20:16.22]I have Transcendence.
[20:18.06]Or I can just get hit in the face.
[20:19.47]Both of that works.
[20:27.43]Super Secret Room!
[20:29.35]You know what?
[20:29.69]I'm gonna use it.
[20:30.93]Just because I want to.
[20:32.93]Should recharge by the time I get to the boss.
[20:36.33]These guys are a real pain.
[20:37.43]Shooting out two at the same time is not cool.
[20:41.19]Super Secret Room, you got something for me?
[20:42.69]Please tell me something good.
[20:46.60]Ooh, you do got something good.
[20:52.56]Transcendence makes it so you can do this.
[20:55.25]Fly over everything.
[20:56.63]I just don't gotta get hit now.
[21:01.35]I just don't gotta get hit.
[21:03.33]That's the perfect way to say it.
[21:09.32]Hmm, I don't wanna do that room.
[21:10.56]There's a chance I'll get hit.
[21:14.78]I gotta get away from this.
[21:16.22]Get away from that.
[21:17.28]That's just total death.
[21:18.78]And I lost my holy heart.
[21:23.38]Woohoo!
[21:24.32]Ah, come on!
[21:27.25]Will somebody just die?
[21:28.69]I can't even hurt these people.
[21:35.79]Oh my god, I need damage up so bad.
[21:41.49]I literally have not killed one of these guys yet.
[21:43.29]Wow.
[21:44.27]It only took you a million years.
[21:51.12]Ugh.
[21:55.78]I gotta get that heart.
[22:00.82]Did Chad drop that?
[22:01.78]I don't even know.
[22:03.31]I don't even know anymore.
[22:06.87]Oh no, these are the worst!
[22:08.15]At least I can hide on one of these things, like this.
[22:11.97]Thank you, Transcendence.
[22:13.86]Holy crap, Transcendence.
[22:15.32]Thank you, you are a lifesaver.
[22:18.24]Whew!
[22:24.18]Go, go, go, go, go.
[22:27.06]What happened after the 50,000 vid?
[22:29.72]Burgah Boy took a very, very long shower.
[22:34.49]At least one of those 15-minute showers that you take, or 20-minute showers.
[22:39.36]Extra shampoo.
[22:42.04]Oh, this is bad.
[22:43.68]Yeah, this is bad.
[22:44.54]I need to use this.
[22:46.16]It was completely necessary.
[22:47.54]I've seen a lot of these guys this playthrough.
[22:52.75]These kind of green, mean green, green machines.
[23:00.35]And a key, perfect.
[23:03.09]Give me something good.
[23:05.27]That is exactly what I'm looking for.
[23:06.69]The halo.
[23:13.05]Oh, so like my body temperature right now?
[23:14.86]You know, I might just turn on the facecam for one second so you guys can see how ridiculous I look right now.
[23:22.20]My entire body is burned.
[23:24.82]I look like a lobster.
[23:25.98]Come on, let me see if I can do this.
[23:29.64]Hold on a second.
[23:31.64]You guys have to see this.
[23:33.84]Alright.
[23:34.38]Hold on, I gotta put a shirt on.
[23:35.82]Hold on a second.
[23:38.61]Hold on!
[23:40.45]Hold on a second!
[23:46.79]I have to share this with somebody.
[23:53.56]It just looks like I'm, like, cartoon mad.
[23:57.24]You know when a cartoon character gets really mad and they're like, their face gets all red?
[24:03.65]Let's turn on the facecam.
[24:05.39]If only for a minute or two.
[24:06.57]Let's see if I can even do it.
[24:08.95]Streamception!
[24:14.07]Can I turn it on?
[24:16.60]Add camera.
[24:20.74]This should turn on.
[24:22.34]Hey!
[24:22.82]Alright, look at me.
[24:24.82]Look at me right now.
[24:26.52]Look at how ridiculous this is.
[24:29.75]Move this out of the way.
[24:31.75]I am burned, seriously, from head to toe.
[24:35.65]It's just insane.
[24:37.29]This is like the most I've ever been burnt on my face in my entire life.
[24:41.85]It almost looks like I have fake spray tanner on or something.
[24:45.01]It's insane.
[24:46.88]Let me move this down a little.
[24:51.90]Alright, fine.
[24:52.40]We'll go with facecam.
[24:54.58]Can I put it over here where it's not going to be in the way?
[24:57.16]Oh, I can.
[24:58.78]Is that too small?
[25:01.13]Should it be, like, to the... maybe lower would be better for Binding of Isaac.
[25:06.09]How about right here?
[25:07.59]Is that gonna be good?
[25:09.05]I can't even, like, see how small that is.
[25:13.51]Burn!
[25:14.07]Burn!
[25:14.59]Burn!
[25:15.03]You know what you do when you get burnt?
[25:16.79]Dr. Pepper!
[25:19.03]This is empty.
[25:20.29]There's nothing in there.
[25:23.37]Alright, is the facecam in a good spot?
[25:25.39]Can you guys... is it too small?
[25:26.81]Too big?
[25:28.50]Or should I just take it away?
[25:29.85]Am I too scary with my red crazy face?
[25:35.39]Make sure of that.
[25:37.03]Make sure of that.
[25:43.01]Take it off!
[25:43.65]Somebody goes, take it off!
[25:45.67]Take off the facecam.
[25:46.89]We hate it.
[25:47.39]Alright, we'll leave it on for this room.
[25:54.71]Because it does use a lot of bandwidth, so I think it probably will start lagging in a second here.
[25:59.47]If the stream has already started lagging, I apologize, but not much I can do about that.
[26:05.79]So I'll turn it off after I complete this area.
[26:14.43]Hopefully this turns into a nice, beautiful tan.
[26:17.62]But I am Irish and Scottish, mostly.
[26:21.28]So I usually get burnt and go right back to being pale.
[26:26.54]That's usually how it works.
[26:28.85]Ooh, time to pay attention to the game.
[26:37.21]Hey, the matchstick.
[26:39.94]Ooh, the matchstick.
[26:44.39]I totally forget what this does, but I'm sure somebody's going to tell me what it is.
[26:51.58]Oh, yes.
[26:52.28]Give me that.
[26:54.04]Matchstick.
[26:54.42]What is it?
[27:02.92]I love waiting for the YouTube chat to catch up.
[27:05.58]Because it's like, I bet you there's a hundred people right now going, this is what the matchstick does.
[27:09.60]And I'm just kind of sitting here like, what is the matchstick?
[27:15.62]Oh!
[27:16.18]Oh!
[27:17.92]Why do... Control puts a bomb down?
[27:22.21]Since when?
[27:22.81]I'll go with the red patch.
[27:25.09]That saved my life earlier.
[27:30.29]Ah, you can't... Yeah, you can.
[27:31.39]You can shoot in here.
[27:32.41]Gotta be careful.
[27:33.31]Hmm...
[27:49.38]Alright.
[27:49.70]What we got?
[27:50.66]What we got in the chat?
[27:52.94]More bombs.
[27:54.42]Bombs everywhere.
[27:56.78]I don't have a key.
[28:01.69]I hate these guys.
[28:02.85]Book of Shadows, baby.
[28:05.05]You got nothing on the Book of Shadows.
[28:06.45]I need to kill you, though.
[28:07.53]I'm just being an idiot.
[28:11.70]Book of Shadows, baby.
[28:17.93]I'm gonna go in the money room.
[28:21.75]Gonna go in the money room.
[28:27.72]Something burns.
[28:28.52]Hey, I smell something burning.
[28:30.96]You guys smell something?
[28:32.22]Oh my god, it's me!
[28:33.72]Oh!
[28:34.32]Mom!
[28:35.36]That was probably really loud.
[28:37.54]Mom, please help me!
[28:38.46]Put me out!
[28:39.10]I'm on fire!
[28:42.18]Go!
[28:42.66]Yes!
[28:44.07]Alright.
[28:44.25]Alright.
[28:48.71]I got a better chance of winning this.
[28:54.58]Ah, get out of here!
[29:02.12]Doesn't Kayn have like a 66% chance to win this?
[29:05.18]Or is that the other thing, the roulette?
[29:10.69]Oh yeah, bombs to blow you up with.
[29:20.60]I want that.
[29:21.12]Give me that.
[29:22.05]Give me that fly thing.
[29:23.85]Damn it.
[29:28.21]At least I can use the blood donation machine.
[29:31.67]Okay, let's start using it.
[29:37.67]Thank you.
[29:41.10]Thank you.
[29:43.32]Thank you.
[29:48.99]Alright, let's... let's at least blow one of these things up.
[29:51.61]Because I want to get into the, uh, secret room.
[29:55.97]Perfect!
[29:56.33]A key!
[29:56.69]Perfect, perfect, perfect!
[29:57.81]That couldn't have gone any more perfect.
[30:02.94]Blow this up too!
[30:03.60]No, I didn't want to do that!
[30:05.78]Of course I did.
[30:07.08]Spirit Heart and got the bomb back.
[30:11.98]Three.
[30:12.37]Best out of three.
[30:15.39]Whatever.
[30:16.93]Whatever.
[30:19.04]But when I talk, moving my mouth, like, ow, my whole face, like, hurts when I move my mouth.
[30:26.71]So I'm trying to, like, talk without moving my face.
[30:29.99]It's kind of hard to do that, though.
[30:33.27]Let's go into the, hold on, my itchy leg.
[30:37.14]Itchy leg.
[30:37.62]Let's go into the money room.
[30:49.19]Oh, yes.
[30:50.53]Yes.
[30:52.55]That is a full health right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[30:56.94]Good game.
[30:58.92]Good game.
[31:01.94]Did I go into the secret room?
[31:03.18]Let me just make sure.
[31:05.10]The super secret room.
[31:06.39]Did I go into it?
[31:10.79]I don't remember if I went into the... I know I went into the...
[31:16.52]I don't remember.
[31:17.12]I really don't remember if I did that or not.
[31:20.16]Did I go into the sec- well, there's two secret rooms, I gotta be more specific.
[31:23.67]Did I go into the one that's in the middle?
[31:25.61]Did I go into that... before I, like, turned the facecam on instead of being a weirdo?
[31:30.81]Did I do that yet?
[31:38.33]I am anxiously waiting your responses.
[31:48.96]you did I did okay yes you did did I I did not go in the super secret room though did I Jerma looks like a tomato I probably do tomato tomato whatever I can figure this out later let's go kill the boss
[32:18.11]Oh, the hollow.
[32:18.83]You guys are nothing.
[32:20.09]I can take you out so easily.
[32:24.32]I don't even need to get hit once.
[32:32.44]Yeah.
[32:34.40]Yeah.
[32:38.02]Almost got hit right there.
[32:38.98]That was not good.
[32:47.86]oh would you just that's a good thing I didn't I did not lose the uh the holy heart yet thank god how ironic I just said I didn't lose the holy heart thank god makes sense here alright tears up
[33:18.71]You know, I don't think I even want to go in the secret room.
[33:22.05]Even if I did or not, but... Here comes a free heart.
[33:28.53]Boom.
[33:30.05]And... For the purposes of stream lag... I don't know, is the stream lagging?
[33:34.03]Should I leave the facecam?
[33:34.99]Do you guys still want to see my burnt face?
[33:40.81]It's up to you guys.
[33:43.61]Takes up a lot of bandwidth, though, to have, like, a facecam on a stream.
[33:46.75]At least that's what I learned.
[33:51.47]Alright, if it's not lagging, then why not, I guess, right?
[33:56.73]Minimize!
[34:00.69]Now, you know what it probably is?
[34:02.50]When you stream heavy 3D games, like Team Fortress 2 and stuff like that, that's when you use all the bandwidth.
[34:08.22]So I'm not really using a whole lot of bandwidth with Isaac, so facecam can stay.
[34:12.76]And I just lost my spirit heart.
[34:15.54]You, I'm gonna take a dump in your breakfast and then watch you eat it and not tell you that I did it.
[34:23.15]Not you guys.
[34:24.39]That guy.
[34:25.01]This guy right here.
[34:27.61]This guy.
[34:28.25]Am I pointing at him?
[34:29.37]He's in the middle of the screen right now.
[34:40.38]I get a little bit irritated with these item rooms not having any keys for them.
[34:49.33]Firing really, really fast here.
[34:50.73]This is good.
[34:51.73]This is very good.
[34:55.42]I'm not doing the blood room.
[34:57.24]It's just dumb.
[34:59.28]Never seems to work.
[35:07.03]Do I dare?
[35:07.95]I'm going to use it.
[35:09.35]I don't want to have to deal with these guys.
[35:10.61]They're so annoying.
[35:13.03]Both of these enemies are so annoying.
[35:17.87]Come on, get out of here.
[35:20.23]Thank you very much.
[35:22.85]Ooh, a new pill.
[35:23.51]Get it.
[35:26.92]Oh god.
[35:34.97]I told you, your breakfast is going to get something you don't like in it.
[35:39.55]Very soon.
[35:40.21]Hey, free bums.
[35:42.93]I'll take all these free bums.
[35:44.81]For free.
[35:49.55]Get out of here.
[35:50.01]Get out of here.
[35:53.23]Get... Take a look at the chat after this.
[36:01.55]You want a better computer?
[36:03.09]It's always good to get a new computer.
[36:04.59]Or to be using a better computer.
[36:06.11]It's always a good thing.
[36:10.97]Oh, I just tried to... There was like two comments I was about to read and it just went... Sorry, I was about to read them.
[36:23.04]Where's my pills?
[36:23.70]There they are.
[36:26.00]Got them.
[36:29.47]Miniboss!
[36:30.71]Super Envy!
[36:35.60]I hate Envy.
[36:38.62]Go ahead, do your little split.
[36:40.26]Oh, you split into more than two.
[36:41.78]That was surprising.
[36:54.97]I need to use this, I'm gonna get smoked.
[36:59.43]I'm gonna get so dead here.
[37:01.39]Like, there's so many of these.
[37:02.63]Are you kidding me?
[37:04.73]Come on, take out as many as I can.
[37:06.04]Thank goodness.
[37:09.00]God.
[37:12.32]Super envy.
[37:12.96]Why did I go in this room?
[37:14.40]I should have just avoided this room totally.
[37:17.36]There was no reason to go in here.
[37:19.57]Besides to get myself killed.
[37:22.72]I think we're okay now, though.
[37:24.22]The majority of the intensity is... Thank you, Meat Cube, for saving my life.
[37:30.69]Come on!
[37:31.41]They, like, blend in with the background!
[37:37.18]Might have been worth it.
[37:39.06]This might have been worth it.
[37:40.22]Let's see.
[37:43.06]It was worth it!
[37:44.54]That was worth it, and I got a key.
[37:46.36]I accept it.
[37:51.07]Get his heart.
[37:53.93]Super envy.
[38:00.14]Got hearts up here.
[38:02.30]I will gladly take them.
[38:05.26]And let's go in the item room.
[38:09.16]The dice?
[38:11.88]What the hell do the dice do?
[38:19.06]No!
[38:27.48]No!
[38:27.70]No!
[38:29.14]My Book of Shadows!
[38:34.49]My Book of... My Book of Shadows is gone!
[38:54.48]I can't believe that just happened.
[39:06.51]Oh, I'm mad.
[39:08.73]You mad right now?
[39:11.43]I'm mad.
[39:12.87]I'm so mad because that was my ticket to getting out of here and winning and completing this.
[39:21.27]I can't believe it.
[39:23.56]Oh, what's this do?
[39:24.42]Oh, I don't know.
[39:26.01]I can't believe that happened.
[39:31.25]See, right now, The Binding of Isaac gods are laughing hysterically at me right now.
[39:39.08]You know what?
[39:39.36]Just blow these guys up.
[39:40.94]Get out of here.
[39:42.44]Get out of here.
[39:45.28]I'll use every bomb I have.
[39:52.50]I'm losing it here.
[39:53.62]I'm starting to lose it here.
[39:55.86]This is where things get a little bit... A little bit angry.
[40:05.35]Silence.
[40:06.83]I have nothing to say to myself right now.
[40:08.99]Besides... I can't believe I just did that.
[40:11.93]I'm not gonna get hit by the spikes.
[40:13.91]What am I doing?
[40:16.78]I do have the full health, though.
[40:18.16]I have the full health pills, so this should not be too bad.
[40:20.76]Please!
[40:22.18]Oh, I thought that was it!
[40:23.18]I thought that was it!
[40:24.08]I thought that was the Book of Shadows!
[40:27.76]Wait a minute!
[40:28.12]Wait a minute!
[40:28.48]Wait a minute!
[40:28.80]Wait a minute!
[40:29.10]Wait a minute!
[40:29.56]I have the dice.
[40:30.56]I have the dice here.
[40:31.68]Hold on.
[40:33.12]I could get it back immediately.
[40:34.72]Let me do that.
[40:37.04]Put this back.
[40:38.70]Go get the dice recharged.
[40:40.04]I'm coming back to this room, and I'm gonna get the Book of Shadows.
[40:42.44]It's gonna be in this room again.
[40:43.94]You'll see.
[40:45.29]You'll see.
[40:47.05]Come on.
[40:47.39]Let's go.
[40:47.81]Let's go.
[40:48.19]Let's go.
[40:48.61]Let's go.
[40:49.63]I'm happy.
[40:50.17]I'm happy again.
[40:50.83]I was a little mad, but I think I'm gonna be able to get it back.
[40:53.01]There's not that many books that you could possibly choose from.
[40:56.31]Get that bomb out of here.
[41:08.74]Will you just recharge already?
[41:11.66]I gotta... There we go.
[41:12.58]Okay.
[41:12.92]Alright.
[41:13.22]Alright.
[41:13.48]Alright.
[41:13.72]Alright.
[41:13.88]Alright.
[41:14.08]Here we go.
[41:14.40]Here we go, guys.
[41:15.02]Are we ready?
[41:15.48]Are we ready for this?
[41:18.01]I'm not going to look.
[41:30.16]What the hell does this even do?
[41:34.62]Oh, cool.
[41:35.40]It's scary.
[41:36.22]At least I have the book of...
[41:45.29]I can't believe it didn't... This makes you have more damage.
[41:56.38]Should I take the dice?
[41:57.48]That's the real question, I guess.
[41:58.68]Should I just keep the dice going?
[42:00.44]What should I do?
[42:03.72]I'll keep the Book of Belial.
[42:04.92]It could really come in handy.
[42:06.56]Extra, extra, extra damage.
[42:12.84]Oh, Binding of Isaac.
[42:14.24]The twists and turns that you do.
[42:29.23]Don't want the treasure map.
[42:30.19]At least I don't think I do.
[42:34.75]I do want that key, though.
[42:35.73]I'm willing to buy that key.
[42:42.81]I can't get over it.
[42:43.55]I'm, like, shaking my computer right now because I can't get over what just happened.
[42:46.69]Let's go in the super secret room.
[42:52.27]Yeah!
[42:53.01]This is good.
[42:57.61]This is not bad, guys.
[42:58.55]This is not bad.
[42:59.09]I got two health refills right now.
[43:06.05]Man, I'm, like, burning up right now.
[43:09.85]I need some, like, aloe vera gel to smear it all over my face.
[43:17.65]Alright, war.
[43:19.49]Oh, instantly get murdered!
[43:23.00]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[43:24.26]Easy.
[43:26.60]Easy, war.
[43:31.56]Yeah, come on.
[43:32.50]Yeah, go ahead.
[43:33.22]Oh, scary.
[43:34.62]Oh, you're real scary.
[43:35.84]Where the hell is he?
[43:36.72]Get over here.
[43:41.33]You got nothing on me, I'm gonna get you.
[43:44.93]You got nothing on me, you son of a bee, bee, bee sting.
[43:49.75]You son of a bee sting.
[43:56.07]He hasn't hit me one time.
[43:57.43]Ah, I say that right when I say he hasn't hit me one time, he hits me.
[44:01.73]Will you stand here for more than one second so I can get a couple shots on you?
[44:04.58]Oh my god, he just keeps teleporting.
[44:13.53]I don't care if I get hit.
[44:14.38]Just get out of here.
[44:18.84]Alright, I got Meat Boy's face.
[44:23.60]What is in here?
[44:26.23]The pole pad?
[44:28.61]What is this?
[44:30.69]What the hell did that do?
[44:39.50]Let's go!
[44:42.44]Stretching my jaw out.
[44:45.14]Hey, in the comments, let me know if you get this as well.
[44:48.16]My jaw, whenever I open it or close it, sometimes it gets stuck.
[44:52.47]And it gets all clicky, like... So I have to, like, stretch it out sometimes.
[44:56.71]And it hurts.
[45:00.17]I guess I could go up to the blood room.
[45:05.07]We're gonna go up to the blood room.
[45:06.57]I'm gonna do the blood room twice.
[45:11.35]I got plenty of hearts.
[45:12.75]Give me something good, or I am going to flip out.
[45:17.47]Hey, you answered my calling.
[45:20.96]Whoa, my god!
[45:22.50]Alright, that's definitely telling me not to do it again.
[45:26.48]So, I'm going to take these pills.
[45:29.27]Go grab the other one.
[45:31.65]I took them just because I could.
[45:40.70]Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.
[45:42.30]Can I not get back in here?
[45:44.34]I was going to say, that would have been really, really bad if I couldn't get back in there.
[45:47.26]Alright, let's go kill Mom.
[45:56.43]Where am I going?
[45:57.87]I'm going the complete opposite direction.
[46:03.28]Yeah, I do have TMJ.
[46:05.60]I have bad TMJ.
[46:06.98]Sometimes I'll sleep and I'll wake up in the morning.
[46:09.89]And I'll be stuck like this.
[46:13.85]And to open my jaw, it'll hurt.
[46:15.52]It'll be like... It's not pleasant at all, I will tell you that.
[46:23.76]Alright.
[46:25.37]Let's go.
[46:27.45]Book... Book of Shadows.
[46:29.27]Don't have it!
[46:29.75]I don't have it!
[46:30.65]I thought I had it.
[46:32.11]Why did I say Book of Shadows?
[46:38.32]Gotta be really careful here.
[46:40.20]Come on, get over here.
[46:48.98]Let's go.
[46:50.16]Speedrun.
[46:51.76]Nice, nice, nice.
[47:07.59]Excellent.
[47:09.99]Open, please.
[47:10.55]A ton of money.
[47:13.99]A ton of money with nothing to do with it.
[47:23.96]Oh, man.
[47:24.82]I'm just gonna use... Probably shouldn't have used it.
[47:29.82]But whatever gets rid of these things faster, I'm all for it.
[47:32.86]Because I hate these enemies so much.
[47:35.17]They're the worst.
[47:37.79]Mmmmm.
[47:46.00]Damn!
[47:46.61]Get away from me!
[48:00.38]Getting a lot of spirit hearts.
[48:01.50]Somebody said the Pope hat.
[48:02.36]That's what the Pope hat does?
[48:03.30]You get a lot more spirit hearts?
[48:04.98]Pretty sick.
[48:08.18]Sitting right here.
[48:12.47]Rapid fire!
[48:19.82]Blow this up.
[48:21.27]Give me whatever's inside of it.
[48:23.77]A key!
[48:25.71]Yay.
[48:35.15]Yikes, troll bomb!
[48:36.17]Come on, now.
[48:39.66]Let's see what you guys are saying.
[48:41.94]Do shoal?
[48:43.62]If I can.
[48:44.44]If I can accomplish shoal, I absolutely will.
[48:49.52]Greed!
[48:50.18]Oh!
[48:53.40]I'm using it on greed.
[48:54.44]I don't want to have to deal with this.
[49:00.42]Ah!
[49:03.18]Ooh!
[49:05.14]I like that.
[49:10.93]This makes you shoot faster.
[49:13.69]I'm keeping this.
[49:15.11]Let's see the difference.
[49:20.01]I'm definitely taking the cancer, absolutely.
[49:22.89]Oh yeah.
[49:23.97]Let's roll with this for a while, hell yeah.
[49:29.16]Whew!
[49:30.47]Heatin' up!
[49:31.11]Heatin' up!
[49:37.07]So when I got back from the beach, I took a bunch of coconut oil, like aloe vera type stuff, and I literally slathered it all over me.
[49:44.99]And within one second, it was just absorbed into my skin.
[49:49.25]That's how dried out and heat exhausted I am right now.
[49:56.92]It was like a sponge.
[49:58.54]It was seriously like you took a sponge and dropped it in your sink and just watched it fill up.
[50:04.68]Mini-greed, I swear to God.
[50:11.78]Oh, they shoot two different ways!
[50:16.21]Not a problem.
[50:17.65]Not a problem.
[50:26.25]It's like synchronized swimming.
[50:27.61]They're all shooting in the same direction.
[50:29.41]La-da-da-da-dee, la-da-da.
[50:35.99]I'm in a really good position here to go pretty much all the way, at least to kill the heart.
[50:40.79]In my opinion.
[50:44.29]Fire rate up, it's already so fa- it's at maximum, it has- this has to be the fastest you can shoot in the entire game, it has to be.
[50:51.76]Has to be.
[50:59.94]Too much information, germs.
[51:03.84]I just needed that aloe vera, man.
[51:11.13]I hate those hangman guys.
[51:12.59]Oh, what's behind me?
[51:15.29]What the hell was that?
[51:19.49]Oh, they shoot two of them.
[51:20.98]One of them does, one of them doesn't.
[51:25.02]Get out of here.
[51:32.75]Book of Shadows.
[51:39.08]This is a book room.
[51:40.46]This is a book room.
[51:42.75]And there's a diaper and a game pad.
[51:48.11]Where are the books?
[51:52.09]In what world is, like, a diaper pad a book?
[51:57.12]I don't know what world you live in, Isaac, but to me, a Game Boy is not a book.
[52:05.14]This guy's super fast.
[52:06.40]Are you kidding me?
[52:08.51]I gotta run him into the TNT.
[52:10.39]Get up here!
[52:11.81]Get up here!
[52:12.96]You know what?
[52:13.56]Forget it.
[52:14.60]You're not helping.
[52:18.72]You are not helping, man, on my quest for glory!
[52:32.64]He's done.
[52:34.96]Spirit heart and a full heart.
[52:36.82]Excellent!
[52:37.94]And a super secret room.
[52:43.18]Oh my goodness, it's my lucky day!
[52:45.50]Actually, not really.
[52:48.80]That doesn't really... That doesn't really do much for me.
[52:53.43]Mom, you are going down!
[52:58.89]Open your face, come on!
[53:00.33]Open it, yeah!
[53:03.36]What do you got?
[53:03.88]What do you got?
[53:05.64]Oh, get your eye.
[53:06.14]Get your eye.
[53:06.74]Poking you in the eye.
[53:07.52]You can't do anything about it.
[53:09.98]I don't even care.
[53:10.54]Go hit me.
[53:11.10]Hit me a million times.
[53:12.14]I have full health.
[53:18.25]And there's mom going down.
[53:21.99]See you later.
[53:25.21]HP up.
[53:25.69]What is this?
[53:27.29]The Polaroid.
[53:30.52]Do I already have Mac?
[53:31.62]I think I already have Mac's...
[53:34.48]Max shot speed.
[53:38.44]Yeah, I definitely already have that.
[53:39.52]I'm gonna just take the Polaroid.
[53:44.93]So many maggots.
[53:48.59]Let's go.
[53:48.83]We're going into the womb.
[53:57.65]Oh, so many things.
[54:00.14]So many things.
[54:00.84]Get out of my face.
[54:06.95]Still not doing enough damage.
[54:08.50]I need to do so much more damage.
[54:10.90]Damage up, pills!
[54:14.64]What?
[54:16.80]Oh, it was the puberty pills.
[54:17.82]You just get like a hair on your head.
[54:19.08]It's stupid.
[54:26.00]Damn!
[54:28.26]I gotta be more careful here, guys.
[54:31.00]Could lose it in this little area here.
[54:37.38]This guy's gonna give me something good.
[54:46.47]Judgment?
[54:47.19]Oh, it's another one of these guys!
[54:48.43]Oh, no it's not, it's just... Look at this!
[54:52.31]Twins!
[54:54.11]Hey, buddy!
[54:55.35]First, I'm gonna get whatever your friend has, and then I'm gonna get whatever he has, too.
[55:00.81]Take all my money.
[55:02.07]You can have every single cent, I don't care.
[55:07.74]Come on!
[55:09.48]Come on!
[55:11.62]Oh, come on.
[55:13.70]Thank you, finally.
[55:14.90]Now your friend better give me something too.
[55:20.87]Or I'll blow him to hell.
[55:23.41]I really will.
[55:27.83]Key.
[55:32.73]I don't want to run out of coins here, you better give me something.
[55:35.95]Come on!
[55:41.25]Still got plenty of money.
[55:42.01]Come on.
[55:43.33]Come on.
[55:43.81]I don't want all your junk.
[55:44.77]I want a real item.
[55:46.74]If you fart out another one of those things, I swear to goodness gracious, you're going down, buddy.
[55:50.64]You are going down.
[55:52.98]I am... This guy is so dead.
[55:56.16]Look at all this stuff he has.
[55:59.58]Come on.
[56:01.61]Come on.
[56:02.69]Come on.
[56:05.01]Oh, you... You piece of crap.
[56:13.72]The Empress.
[56:14.26]What does the Empress card do?
[56:15.28]I don't even know.
[56:18.56]I can always come back if I have some more money.
[56:21.50]I will do that.
[56:23.24]Definitely doing this.
[56:26.17]Hey, I got a quarter for you.
[56:27.99]Or a penny, whatever it is.
[56:28.81]You better give me something now.
[56:29.77]This is it.
[56:32.71]Oh, this room is enormous.
[56:33.95]Oh my god, this whole area is huge.
[56:37.25]Whatever.
[56:38.01]Let's do it.
[56:58.03]UGH!
[56:59.85]Why don't you guys just go down, man?
[57:08.64]Alright, so far so good.
[57:10.86]So far so good.
[57:14.87]Don't want to get rid of you yet.
[57:17.17]You could be useful in a little bit.
[57:20.15]I will take that heart.
[57:24.51]Eye of Death!
[57:25.53]Eye of Death!
[57:29.96]Stream is lagging!
[57:31.86]Better not be.
[57:33.89]Or I'm going to punch my internet in the face.
[57:47.26]Ugh, at least I got spirit hearts.
[57:53.48]You screaming angels!
[57:56.64]Dead.
[58:00.32]Hmm.
[58:01.76]Secret room.
[58:03.38]Definitely going to go into you.
[58:05.83]For sure.
[58:06.31]I got a really good setup here, guys.
[58:13.05]Probably going to beat this whole thing.
[58:20.59]Oh my god.
[58:22.64]It doesn't get better than that.
[58:23.76]That's a one-up.
[58:27.70]Hmm.
[58:28.08]Hmm.
[58:30.69]That's a one-up.
[58:33.46]Sweet!
[58:40.68]Come at me, bro.
[58:42.20]Come at me, bro.
[58:46.92]Oh, this is bad.
[58:48.33]Double Gemini.
[58:51.97]I guess if I circle around him, it's not too bad.
[58:53.99]Not too, too bad.
[59:02.05]I'm losing a lot of hearts here.
[59:03.51]This is not going as much as I wanted to plan for.
[59:09.53]Slow down, slow down.
[59:15.74]Lost three hearts here.
[59:18.00]Did not want to have that happen!
[59:25.32]It's alright, I gained one back.
[59:26.30]I gained one back, we're good.
[59:32.90]Hierophant.
[59:34.32]I don't know... Oh, yeah.
[59:38.24]Everything I lost, I just got right back.
[59:46.72]Go down.
[59:50.15]Not in a good spot.
[59:53.49]Not in a good spot!
[59:55.21]Not in a good spot!
[59:56.05]Not in a good spot!
[60:01.07]Oh, come on.
[60:08.10]Oh my god.
[60:11.82]I might just try... After this area, I'm just gonna go fight the boss.
[60:16.04]I'm gonna get myself killed.
[60:18.26]I'm gonna run into an unfair room and just die.
[60:22.72]Yeah, get me out of here.
[60:23.50]Get me the hell out of here after this.
[60:24.90]I'm getting the freak out of here.
[60:30.84]Going to fight the boss.
[60:32.66]The big boss, man.
[60:39.16]Boss, you're dead!
[60:40.68]Actually, I want to open this.
[60:42.40]Something cool could be in here.
[60:48.05]And I don't even know what this does, so I'm not going to even use it because I don't even care.
[60:54.97]Backstretch.
[60:57.39]Whew!
[60:59.17]So, you know when you get this, like, type of heat exhaustion?
[61:02.01]Where your whole face is just burning and your whole body's just burning?
[61:05.97]You start to feel really weird.
[61:08.17]I'm kind of feeling like that right now.
[61:09.51]Just like, duh!
[61:12.85]Emperor or Empress.
[61:13.78]I think these, uh... Whatever, I'm just gonna use them.
[61:19.32]No sense in letting them sit on the ground, right?
[61:20.82]Except I think that one brings you to the boss.
[61:25.00]Don't want to use that one!
[61:27.47]No way, no how.
[61:31.15]Mmm.
[61:32.37]Loki 2.
[61:34.55]You're so dead, man.
[61:38.70]You can hurt me as much as you want to hurt me.
[61:40.42]I don't even care.
[61:45.56]There goes one half.
[61:47.82]Half number 2 is going down right now.
[61:54.48]Goodbye!
[61:55.02]And another extra heart.
[61:57.97]Awesome.
[61:59.87]Let's just go.
[62:00.31]I ain't gonna waste any time.
[62:01.99]Let's just go.
[62:06.99]Left or right?
[62:07.75]Let's go down.
[62:08.65]Secret room is down there.
[62:09.45]Might as well go try and see what I can do in it.
[62:20.02]Come here!
[62:24.11]Alright, what are people saying?
[62:24.77]Let's see, let's read the chat for a little bit.
[62:28.95]Oh, that's what the Ace of Spades does?
[62:31.49]I probably could have used it.
[62:37.92]Although, if I do get to Isaac, if you show Isaac the Polaroid, don't you, like, get something cool with some secret ending or something like that?
[62:44.91]That's what I hear.
[62:46.55]Don't know how true it is, though.
[62:54.33]Mmm, guys, I burst out of the ground.
[62:57.25]You frog freaks.
[62:59.59]I hate every single one of you.
[63:04.59]Yes!
[63:10.16]Two Spirit Hearts, I'll take it.
[63:21.47]Oh, I hate these.
[63:21.89]These are the worst enemies in the game.
[63:23.33]I say that about every enemy.
[63:24.39]These are the worst enemies in the game.
[63:25.51]You guys are a real pain in my butt.
[63:35.79]Whatever.
[63:37.95]Oh my god, it's double gluttony.
[63:39.80]I'm using it.
[63:42.68]I don't want to have to fight these guys for more than 10 seconds.
[63:45.10]Get out of my face.
[63:48.98]Ugh.
[63:55.25]I've lost a lot of health here, this is not good.
[64:01.96]Oh no!
[64:03.06]Oh no!
[64:04.22]Oh, Super Greed!
[64:05.96]Super Greed!
[64:08.08]Super Greed, not good!
[64:09.22]Not good, Super Greed, I'm- Super Greed, I- I- Everything I ever said about you, I take back, I think you're a really strapping young man, I really like you, you're nice, and- Oh, this is very, very bad.
[64:22.98]Super Greed.
[64:24.65]You gonna throw that BS at me right now, Isaac?
[64:28.78]You son of a... Hey, good thing I got a quarter!
[64:35.02]Oh, yay!
[64:43.08]Look at my health.
[64:45.90]I'm gonna have to use the health before I even get to the boss.
[64:49.14]That's not a... That's not cool.
[64:50.39]I'm not happy about this.
[64:54.97]Let's just go over.
[64:55.71]I have a feeling it's not this way.
[64:57.66]Yes, it is.
[64:58.12]Thank goodness it's this way.
[64:59.04]I would have been very, very upset.
[65:06.82]Ugh!
[65:09.36]Teleport pills?
[65:10.36]No, I don't want these.
[65:12.06]Alright, Mom!
[65:14.06]You're dead!
[65:18.35]Book!
[65:19.39]Get rid of these things.
[65:20.03]I'm getting stuck on the wall.

[67:05.88]Can I do it?
[67:06.36]Can I do it?
[67:07.22]I did it!
[67:07.50]I did it!
[67:09.72]Yeah!
[67:11.98]I can't go to Shoal, though.
[67:15.25]I did it.
[67:15.93]I've completed Isaac.
[67:17.69]Isaac playthrough stream complete.
[67:21.57]Can I... What's in here?
[67:29.63]He seems to be very happy about something.
[67:35.86]What?
[67:37.82]Hold on, I didn't... If I have this save file, how is that possible?
[67:47.35]Doesn't that unlock Judas?
[67:51.18]Hold on a second.
[67:55.10]Yeah, that's Judas.
[67:56.82]Maybe it's all screwed up from it being there.
[68:00.98]From me bringing it over to my computer and coming over to my computer, his computer, and all that sort of stuff.
[68:05.56]But it's okay.
[68:07.10]I still beat it.
[68:08.20]I still completed the heart.
[68:10.08]I'm content with that.
[68:12.32]So what we're going to do now, before I end the stream, I just wanted to do kind of like a power hour.
[68:16.46]Because as you can see, I'm dying right now, guys.
[68:20.66]Well, not literally, but metaphorically, I am burning up right now.
[68:25.14]So before I get lost into heat exhaustion delirium, which is what I'm doing right now, I'm just like, yeah, where am I?
[68:33.20]What time is it?
[68:34.42]I'm going to play some QWOP and then probably end the stream to get a little bit of rest.
[68:38.96]So let's move over to QWOP.
[68:55.60]Where is it?
[68:57.18]Co-op.
[68:58.72]Co-op.
[69:03.65]There it is.
[69:06.17]Gotta get out of Isaac.

[69:41.36]But just look at it.
[69:42.52]It goes all the way.
[69:44.22]It literally goes all the way down.
[69:46.10]So I am becoming crazy right now.
[69:49.09]I'm having heat delirium.
[69:51.09]So I need to get a Dr. Pepper in me.
[69:53.63]A nice cold Dr. Pepper.
[69:55.67]Did a little bit of sleep.
[69:56.91]You guys know the deal.
[69:57.77]You guys know how it is.
[69:59.83]But in the meantime, let's load up some co-op with the giant facecam.
[70:03.62]This is a huge facecam.
[70:05.68]Oh my god.
[70:07.80]Hold on.
