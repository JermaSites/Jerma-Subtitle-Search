[ve:60.16.100]

[00:08.83]I am back.
[00:12.83]Okay.
[00:14.23]So we got... I don't know.
[00:16.31]Yeah, which... Maybe you guys can help me and go over which one of these are any good.
[00:23.10]Because I really... I have no idea.
[00:26.40]I just got keys for random cases that I still have in my inventory.
[00:29.82]And I... You might look at this and go, holy shit.
[00:33.18]This guy is stupid.
[00:35.34]He got keys for the winter 2018 case.
[00:41.92]I just, I don't know.
[00:42.40]I didn't want to get, I wanted just to open them.
[00:45.04]That's the good one.
[00:45.88]No, that's the good one.
[00:46.70]That's the good one.
[00:48.42]Well, we'll find out.
[00:54.32]Okay.
[00:57.22]You should be able to see it.
[01:00.76]Very shortly.
[01:01.56]Okay, here we go.
[01:03.50]You ready?
[01:06.52]So what, what's, uh... What do you think?
[01:10.00]What do you think?
[01:10.44]I got 25 cases to open.
[01:12.42]Uh, how are these?
[01:14.70]Are these alright?
[01:17.56]This is Blue Moon.
[01:21.89]Tough Break.
[01:23.73]Rainy Day.
[01:25.69]Abominable.
[01:28.83]Scream Fortress.
[01:30.37]Is that 12? 12?
[01:34.59]Winter 2018.
[01:35.97]Winter 2020.
[01:38.11]Summer 2023, obviously.
[01:39.63]These are the new ones right here.
[01:41.87]These four are for this update.
[01:46.27]Winter 2020.
[01:46.95]That's a lot of winter and a lot of Scream Fortress.
[01:51.26]Jungle Jackpot.
[01:54.32]Infernal Reward.
[01:56.08]Alright.
[01:56.68]Are we just going to go?
[01:58.58]Facecam?
[01:59.10]No, no, no.
[02:00.26]No facecam.
[02:02.20]Just imagine what I look like right now.
[02:05.15]You scammed.
[02:06.09]Scammed.
[02:07.61]Will he unbox at least one strange item?
[02:09.99]I kind of feel like that's gonna happen.
[02:19.94]Okay.
[02:20.24]You ready?
[02:20.98]Let's just start at the top.
[02:22.16]I made it nice and clear.
[02:22.96]By the way, this is what I was talking about.
[02:25.92]This is just all the scout primaries, all the scout secondaries, all the scout melees.
[02:31.17]I like there to be some separation here.
[02:35.99]By quality.
[02:37.73]Notice how this is by quality.
[02:42.33]Soldier.
[02:43.35]Right?
[02:47.54]That's a minimum wear.
[02:49.40]What are my best items?
[02:50.22]Let me see.
[02:52.38]It's factory new.
[02:54.82]I have... Yeah, okay.
[02:57.08]I've got... This is a factory new Warhawk flamethrower.
[03:00.01]This thing is pretty sick.
[03:02.41]Nice organization.
[03:03.15]Yeah.
[03:03.47]Oh, yeah.
[03:05.71]I have a really good sniper rifle too, or is it?
[03:10.74]Yeah, I got a purple range factory new.
[03:13.68]Cool.
[03:14.72]I also have a field tested one.
[03:16.22]Why do I still have this?
[03:17.08]I don't know.
[03:18.90]Where's the skip button to the unboxing?
[03:20.90]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[03:22.02]Alright, blue moon.
[03:23.72]Let's see.
[03:24.08]Are we ready?
[03:28.15]Here we go.
[03:28.97]I could get any of these.
[03:32.29]We're looking for the Robin Walkers.
[03:35.61]Why are people mega lulling?
[03:36.77]Is this a bad one?
[03:38.87]Let's go.
[03:45.49]Oh, I got an assassin's attire.
[03:49.76]Something else.
[03:52.28]Oh, a free ticket.
[03:53.44]I don't want to do this anymore.
[04:00.94]I think I'm done.
[04:01.68]That was alright.
[04:03.11]Cool.
[04:03.57]Wait, let's look at it.
[04:11.16]Okay, I put the Gibbous on.
[04:12.91]Because I didn't want people to be mad that I was a bad spy player.
[04:17.01]I forgot.
[04:17.59]Alright.
[04:18.43]I put this on to, like, hide.
[04:20.09]Because I didn't want people to... Because if you're in, like, full cosmetics, if you're, like, decked out with a bunch of crazy shit, people are like, oh, that's... Look at all this cool stuff the spy has.
[04:29.68]I put the Gibbous on because I want people to go like, oh, that's like... I don't know.
[04:32.32]He might have been playing for very long.
[04:33.40]Alright, let's put it on.
[04:36.44]Ooh.
[04:38.96]Ooh.
[04:43.02]I like it.
[04:44.88]Cool.
[04:46.32]Okay.
[04:51.32]Cool.
[04:52.21]Let's do it again.
[04:58.63]I got two items again.
[05:00.17]What is it?
[05:01.89]Sky high fly guy and a backpack expander.
[05:08.07]That's cool.
[05:08.43]Those are like worth, aren't these like five bucks?
[05:13.49]These things are like five or six bucks, aren't they?
[05:19.25]LOL, no.
[05:20.89]No, no, no.
[05:21.79]They're a dollar.
[05:22.35]They're like five cents.
[05:24.38]Oh.
[05:26.56]Okay.
[05:26.98]Well, that's cool.
[05:30.48]Yeah, I already have.
[05:31.22]I don't really need to use this.
[05:33.88]Who's this for?
[05:36.10]Soldier.
[05:41.28]I like it.
[05:45.23]Cool.
[05:48.23]I'm going to keep it on.
[05:49.27]We're going to be here all day?
[05:50.19]No, we're not.
[05:54.68]Let's do it again.
[05:58.22]What's the good thing from this?
[05:59.34]This is the last chance.
[06:03.53]Oh, it's another blue.
[06:05.95]I freaking love gambling.
[06:08.31]I kind of just want the cosmetics, if I'm honest.
[06:11.92]Because I've given my backpack away, like, three times over the last ten years.
[06:15.84]So, I don't really have very many, like, cosmetic items.
[06:19.15]I kind of want to, like, just get some more.
[06:22.55]This is heavy, obviously, right?
[06:26.81]I mean, I don't think I can take off the powdered wig.
[06:29.44]That's just not going to happen.
[06:35.44]I got a genuine Pounding Father, by the way.
[06:39.32]Jealous?
[06:45.21]I like it.
[06:47.99]That's two jackets.
[06:53.81]One of them is just ripping through the other one.
[06:55.81]I like it.
[06:56.31]It looks like I don't know what I'm doing.
[06:58.25]That's perfect.
[07:00.11]Two jacket Andy, yeah.
[07:02.55]I'm keeping it.
[07:02.95]Alright, now that's all those.
[07:06.71]So those are gone.
[07:07.89]Tough break.
[07:10.05]We're looking for a well-wrapped hat.
[07:14.39]Okay.
[07:16.00]Let's go.
[07:23.77]What's that?
[07:25.39]Ooh, what's that?
[07:26.13]Is that good?
[07:26.85]Should I even care?
[07:27.97]Winter backup?
[07:29.37]What was that?
[07:29.73]Was it good?
[07:36.95]It's an engineer item.
[07:38.01]I love the engineer stuff.
[07:42.30]Uh, where is it?
[07:44.04]That's kind of a rare one.
[07:49.75]I like it, but I wish I... I want the hair still.
[07:52.69]That's not the worst thing you could get?
[07:53.63]Yeah.
[07:57.73]It's pretty neat.
[07:58.27]I like it.
[08:01.57]I'm not taking the... the level 3 chin off, though.
[08:05.51]Or... the stomach.
[08:07.07]It's important.
[08:11.69]Good.
[08:11.89]This is exactly what I wanted.
[08:12.95]I wanted just to get items to put on to wear, because I want to be able to have different outfits.
[08:18.39]Alright, so let me see.
[08:19.45]What else is in here?
[08:20.95]So that was a good one.
[08:21.79]That was winter backup.
[08:25.41]I could inspect them, but I don't want to.
[08:27.41]I like to be surprised.
[08:28.11]Another backpack expander.
[08:39.01]Okay.
[08:41.35]But what's the real item?
[08:45.01]Uh, Ooh, this is another one.
[08:47.07]Bonk batters.
[08:47.97]So this is a backpack.
[08:49.85]This is another kind of, kind of rare one.
[08:51.52]That's cool.
[08:53.08]Let me see it.
[08:56.26]Oh shit.
[08:56.70]That's like one of the better ones.
[09:06.91]Cool.
[09:09.97]This is not a bad drip for the scout.
[09:14.19]This kind of like hooded sweatshirt with the bonk on the back and the sneakers.
[09:20.18]This is a pretty good outfit.
[09:22.48]I like this.
[09:23.02]I'm into it.
[09:27.99]Nice.
[09:31.18]Alright.
[09:31.48]One more of these.
[09:34.08]Also, I'm not, I'm probably not going to do this again.
[09:36.02]This is kind of just like a one and done kind of deal.
[09:39.54]I just want to get some more cosmetics.
[09:41.31]So don't expect like, oh yeah, I'm going to open like 50 cases every week.
[09:44.75]That's no.
[09:47.99]I just had a bunch of inventory and I'm just kind of clearing it out and I was going to do it off stream, but it's like, you know what?
[09:53.10]Why don't we just, why don't I just do it here?
[09:56.34]So this is probably not happening again.
[10:00.58]Kappa, Kappa, Kappa.
[10:02.80]Well, it might happen at some... I don't know, but it's not like... I'm not just going to open cases.
[10:07.16]It's not a regular thing.
[10:13.31]Is this a demo?
[10:15.93]Medic.
[10:16.25]I like the chef hat.
[10:24.06]Oh, that's cool.
[10:25.60]Okay, I'll keep it.
[10:30.74]Alright, I only have one of these.
[10:32.30]I have one Rainy Day.
[10:35.80]So, it better be good.
[10:38.52]You do not think that's cool.
[10:42.90]This is the best one?
[10:44.70]Rainy Day is... Rainy Day is best one, actually, unironically, for real, people are saying.
[10:49.46]This is, like, the best one that I have?
[10:54.38]Alright.
[10:56.05]Here we go.
[11:03.47]What is that?
[11:06.85]That's cool.
[11:07.82]I like this one a lot.
[11:09.04]I'm gonna wear this right now.
[11:11.02]It's gonna replace the Gibbous.
[11:19.26]Oh, I can't have the sunglasses on.
[11:25.90]It's perfect.
[11:26.54]Alright, what else?
[11:27.02]Do I have anything else?
[11:32.89]Mmm...
[11:42.28]That's not bad.
[11:44.03]Do it with the Gibbous?
[11:46.29]No, I'm not putting the Gibbous on with this.
[11:52.43]I like this because it's got the microphone.
[11:54.05]Alright, I'm keeping it.
[11:59.69]Okay, so I also have one of these.
[12:05.55]Abominable Cosmetic Case.
[12:11.14]Drip or drop?
[12:13.00]Um, I don't know.
[12:13.76]Explain the stream title?
[12:15.90]A mod did it.
[12:16.50]I don't know.
[12:17.26]I cannot condone anything that the mods are doing right now.
[12:19.05]I have no idea what it says.
[12:20.15]I can't even look over there because it's tabbed out.
[12:23.97]Alright, what's in this one?
[12:27.75]Let's get a red.
[12:35.23]Can you guys even hear it being opened?
[12:37.45]I'll take a manco ticket.
[12:38.40]Why not?
[12:45.31]Sniper?
[12:48.55]Barely.
[12:49.29]Eh, it's alright.
[12:52.18]That looks like a cool sniper hat.
[12:55.82]Kind of low on the tier list, but... See, I got a red already.
[13:04.87]The sniper outfit I don't think can change.
[13:07.27]It's too good.
[13:12.31]You know what I mean?
[13:13.15]I'm not sure I can take that off.
[13:14.97]It's too good.
[13:24.14]Skibidi Toilet looking motherfucker.
[13:29.60]It works.
[13:30.44]I can put it on a different loadout.
[13:35.31]Yeah, look at this one.
[13:39.41]Skibidi Toilet.
[13:41.07]Oh, come on.
[13:45.98]Alright, we'll do the war paint after.
[13:48.70]I feel like we do that as a follow-up.
[13:51.78]We'll do the cosmetics first.
[13:53.52]Alright, this is winter 2018.
[13:54.86]I was told that don't do these because they're terrible.
[13:58.53]Well, it's too late.
[13:59.33]I already have four keys for it.
[14:02.01]So, we'll get through it.
[14:04.09]This is winter 2018.
[14:05.07]I only have two of these.
[14:14.38]How is that terrible?
[14:15.16]That's awesome.
[14:17.96]I have a little, like, engineer thing now.
[14:20.92]Are you serious?
[14:24.74]It's for the pyro?
[14:29.01]By the way, imagine this motherfucker sitting in spawn AFK.
[14:33.93]This is the actual loadout.
[14:35.87]Caught red-handed.
[14:37.70]This is the loadout.
[14:38.36]This is it right here.
[14:39.20]This is my loadout.
[14:44.12]Caught red-handed.
[14:47.56]I love my Pyro loadout.
[14:48.99]I think it looks great.
[14:49.77]I love the glasses.
[14:51.47]But... That's cool, too.
[14:58.00]Mosquito face?
[14:58.92]Yeah.
[15:00.40]I painted it white, yeah.
[15:05.18]That's funny.
[15:06.49]I'll keep it.
[15:10.80]Got one more of those.
[15:11.92]So what's the good stuff?
[15:13.88]Dumbbell.
[15:15.48]Millennial Mercenary.
[15:17.08]I'm very curious about that.
[15:19.82]Breadheads.
[15:30.65]Oh, wow.
[15:34.61]And I got a Festivizer.
[15:40.64]Uh, Engineer's my favorite class too, so this is great.
[15:42.99]I'm glad to get this.
[15:44.07]But I can't replace anything.
[15:52.06]Shit.
[16:16.27]It works.
[16:21.03]Cool.
[16:21.55]Alright.
[16:22.43]I'm liking the Engie stuff.
[16:23.49]Alright.
[16:25.07]Now we're going to teleport two years.
[16:27.51]This is winter 2020.
[16:29.74]I've never opened one of these.
[16:30.70]I don't have anything.
[16:38.40]Why are you using the Pompson?
[16:39.54]Because a lot of items got changed.
[16:43.31]And I was just curious as to how much.
[16:46.82]Alright, 20-20.
[16:47.16]Give us something good.
[16:49.52]That's... That's pretty great.
[16:52.96]I can wear those right now, right?
[16:54.22]Can I wear these right now?
[16:59.58]Who can wear these?
[17:02.32]It's an all class?
[17:05.83]Oh, god damn it.
[17:07.25]Oh, damn it.
[17:11.57]Oh, damn it.
[17:12.51]Okay.
[17:13.05]That's exactly what's going on.
[17:17.84]I think this is a perfect loadout now.
[17:25.61]Put it on every class.
[17:29.86]Put it on the fat guy NG.
[17:31.54]Oh, that's a good idea.
[17:34.61]Hold on.
[17:48.05]I need to get rid of the helmet, though.
[17:58.28]That's going to be so annoying to every single person that plays the game with me.
[18:02.28]It looks awful.
[18:04.66]I think it looks great.
[18:05.30]What about blue, right?
[18:06.92]Ooh, cool.
[18:08.76]Yeah.
[18:11.30]I love it.
[18:14.10]Remove the tracker?
[18:18.72]Uh, I like it.
[18:28.34]Those are all the way down.
[18:29.16]I would put those up at pink.
[18:31.00]Those are- that's a pink item.
[18:32.38]That's not a blue.
[18:40.23]Oh my goodness.
[18:42.17]Oh my goodness, it's perfect!
[18:48.40]And I can wear this all year?
[18:53.88]It's all class?
[19:08.23]Am I gonna really just be like the Christmas dickhead?
[19:15.98]I guess so.
[19:22.61]Hey, Merry Christmas all year.
[19:24.32]Put it on the soldier.
[19:41.97]Yep, it works.
[19:43.05]It works pretty well.
[19:46.21]Especially because of the Santa.
[19:47.87]The heavy would be great.
[19:50.81]Hold on.
[20:05.36]Okay.
[20:06.52]Not bad.
[20:13.96]That's phenomenal.
[20:22.92]Just put it on every single character and just be Christmas on every single character.
[20:26.05]Alright, let's keep going.
[20:31.17]I'll do these last because these are...
[20:35.64]Oh, who cares?
[20:36.56]Should I just do them now?
[20:37.16]This is this year.
[20:37.82]This is the cosmetics for right now.
[20:39.22]The patch.
[20:40.54]Should I just do them now?
[20:46.46]Do it now?
[20:47.48]Do it last.
[20:48.02]Alright, we'll do these both last.
[20:49.30]Because this is also the Warpaint from this update too.
[20:52.06]Alright, with that being said.
[20:58.12]This is Scream Fortress.
[20:59.10]This is Warpaint now.
[21:02.39]So Warpaint is the factory new minimum wear, field tested, like you're probably used to being seen.
[21:11.37]They changed how this works.
[21:12.75]I kind of understand it now.
[21:15.07]But let's find out.
[21:17.94]So I don't have very many left, so let's go.
[21:23.34]I only have one of these?
[21:24.70]Oh, this is X. Let's go.
[21:27.16]What is it?
[21:31.28]It's... It's really scuffed.
[21:35.24]It's one of the good ones, but it is fucking destroyed.
[21:40.22]Damn it.
[21:40.88]Is that the worst one?
[21:42.07]Is that the worst quality?
[21:44.29]Field tested.
[21:45.13]Damn it.
[21:49.69]Uh, let's put it on, like, something.
[21:57.53]So you can put this on any of these.
[21:59.71]That's really cool.
[22:01.03]And I think it randomizes.
[22:05.29]It's a puke weapon, yeah.
[22:06.69]What about... The Ubersaw stuff looks really good on.
[22:10.85]Shotgun, you can't go wrong either.
[22:12.03]Because so many people can use it.
[22:15.60]I mean, it is a booger gun.
[22:19.62]Cool.
[22:22.40]What about the minigun?
[22:23.14]Minigun always... Looks pretty cool.
[22:31.12]Too bad it's field tested.
[22:32.26]Field tested is the second worst, right?
[22:38.11]Damn it.
[22:38.63]It's one of the good ones too.
[22:41.63]So it goes battle scarred, field tested, well worn, minimal wear, factory new.
[22:49.59]I think that's correct.
[22:53.70]Let's do it again.
[23:01.09]Something good.
[23:01.73]At least something with higher quality.
[23:06.05]Oh, look at how awesome that one is too.
[23:07.86]And it looks all fucked up.
[23:12.04]Damn it.
[23:12.90]This could have been my favorite paint.
[23:18.77]Field tested.
[23:19.55]Damn it.
[23:26.68]Although it is a Halloween kind of weapon, the scuffed in the blood actually kind of adds to it.
[23:32.87]Trash this?
[23:35.95]I don't think it needs to be trashed.
[23:42.13]I kind of like it on the wrench.
[23:47.98]So, from my understanding, when...
[23:53.31]When this is put on, it gives a random pattern of this paint.
[24:01.06]So it's kind of just showing you what's even possible, right?
[24:08.66]I'm seeing a lot of nos.
[24:10.66]You choose the pattern.
[24:13.56]Oh.
[24:16.30]Somebody just said, who cares?
[24:17.72]I guess at the end of the day, that's right.
[24:21.18]Alright, this is winter 2020 paint.
[24:25.65]We gotta cross our fingers here for this one.
[24:28.22]Because... We have the full Santa Claus outfit.
[24:32.52]And if we get like a cool... Kinda like candy cane paint.
[24:45.78]Manco ticket, okay.
[24:53.27]That's really cool.
[24:57.15]But how cool is it?
[25:00.05]Field tested again.
[25:09.75]Looks great, but another field tested.
[25:12.11]Gosh darn it.
[25:14.77]I would put it on a blade.
[25:16.51]Ice blade.
[25:16.97]Not bad.
[25:26.17]It's cool.
[25:31.19]Starlight Serenity Warpaint.
[25:33.35]Alright, so that's the one you want.
[25:41.52]Ooh!
[25:43.82]That looks pretty good.
[25:45.54]I don't see very much wrong with this.
[25:54.36]And a Strange Count Transfer Tool.
[25:58.66]Cool.
[26:06.95]Ah, here it is.
[26:08.29]It is Factory New.
[26:09.35]Alright, it's one of the lower tiers, but that's fine.
[26:13.41]It's Factory New.
[26:19.30]Holy shit.
[26:24.80]I'm gonna be so annoying.
[26:37.49]That's really annoying, but I think it kind of has to be there.
[26:42.47]And put the Festivizer on it?
[26:43.90]Yeah, that's funny.
[26:47.72]Okay.
[26:49.10]That leads to this one.
[26:51.06]This is another... Does it scream?
[26:52.79]Fortress... It's 14? 14?
[27:05.34]Cream corned war paint.
[27:07.32]This is beat up a lot.
[27:08.96]That does not look good.
[27:12.86]Well worn, yeah.
[27:22.04]Doesn't look terrible.
[27:31.96]I could work on something.
[27:41.20]You can put it on the fish.
[27:42.54]That's funny.
[27:45.19]Looks sick.
[27:47.63]Yeah, no one's going to get that close to see it anyways.
[27:51.79]Cool.
[27:55.83]Alright, so now we've got down to the last little bits of war paint.
[28:01.37]This was Jungle Jackpot.
[28:03.69]I don't have any of these.
[28:06.13]Give me a factory new.
[28:06.77]I only got one factory new.
[28:17.93]shit bamboo brushed war paint yeah the the scarring on it looks a little weird it's the weed one yeah this one's kind of this one's kind of junk
[28:47.51]Although it's really not that bad.
[28:51.33]It's a little junky.
[28:53.45]It's a lot junky.
[28:56.79]It's a lot junky.
[28:58.63]The scuffs messes with the pattern.
[29:02.44]Because without the scuffs, it would still have this shading here.
[29:06.16]So it just makes it look kind of all broken.
[29:09.42]But it's alright.
[29:20.71]That looks pretty good.
[29:21.72]I think that's a factory new.
[29:25.80]And it's a leopard print.
[29:28.78]Oh, nice.
[29:29.34]Okay.
[29:29.68]What else?
[29:32.18]Another Manco ticket.
[29:37.15]I want to see.
[29:38.39]It is factory new.
[29:39.33]Nice.
[29:39.51]Alright.
[29:41.85]What am I going to put the leopard print on?
[29:44.03]Damn.
[29:46.99]Damn.
[29:50.13]Wait, it can be different colors?
[29:56.28]Whoa, that's cool.
[30:04.27]That's really cool.
[30:10.21]Everything looks so good on the minigun.
[30:12.31]There's just so much surface area.
[30:15.60]Alright, that's, I'm gonna have to, that's gonna take a decision.
[30:19.97]Because it works on almost everything.
[30:31.28]That looks awesome.
[30:35.98]Cool.
[30:36.30]Alright.
[30:36.58]I got a good one.
[30:37.60]Even if it's not, if it's a low rarity, but who cares?
[30:40.40]Again, I'm not looking for rare.
[30:41.76]I'm not looking for unusuals.
[30:43.18]I'm not looking for anything like that.
[30:44.82]I'm just, I just want more cosmetic items because I just don't have very many.
[30:50.55]Alright, this is Infernal Reward.
[30:52.27]I don't know what this is or what year this is, but this is... We got two more of these.
[30:58.67]Yeah, I don't even care if it's like field tested as long as it looks kind of cool.
[31:01.35]Okay.
[31:08.68]Strange part.
[31:09.42]Tanks destroyed.
[31:16.22]And... Merc stained war paint.
[31:20.65]Tanks destroyed.
[31:22.89]Man versus machine.
[31:23.47]It's going to be field tested.
[31:29.41]No, that's fine.
[31:31.60]That doesn't look like minimal wear.
[31:32.94]That looks kind of beat up.
[31:34.98]It looks pretty beat up.
[31:38.22]This looks beat up.
[31:48.36]I'm surprised that's minimal wear.
[31:50.73]What do the other ones look like, if that's what it looks like for... I like that.
[32:07.24]Cool.
[32:10.04]It's too bright.
[32:10.78]I think it looks alright.
[32:14.88]Alright, this is the last one of these, and then we only have the cases that
[32:20.30]For this current event.
[32:27.22]Cardboard box.
[32:33.61]Minimal wear.
[32:34.21]So this is just a cardboard item.
[32:51.14]Put it on the black box?
[32:59.46]That's a great place to put it.
[33:05.12]Cardboard rocket launcher.
[33:10.93]Nice.
[33:12.35]It's the Labo.
[33:13.35]It does look like the Labo.
[33:17.71]Cool.
[33:18.99]Alright.
[33:20.54]So now, we just got these four left.
[33:24.00]And it's the Summer 2023 stuff.
[33:28.68]So what do I want from here?
[33:30.84]Put that on the Rap Assassin?
[33:37.49]Because it's not always the red rare items that people want.
[33:47.09]Do the Warpaint first.
[33:49.36]Because that's less exciting.
[33:50.24]Okay.
[33:52.64]Let's go.
[33:52.98]Alright.
[33:53.32]This is it.
[33:53.74]This is this update.
[33:55.94]Let's see what happens.
[33:56.52]That looks pretty new.
[34:00.25]That looks pretty new.
[34:07.89]What?
[34:12.51]I didn't see.
[34:12.89]What was it?
[34:14.41]It is factory new.
[34:18.17]Nice.
[34:31.91]Inspect the cases to see the options.
[34:34.01]I like to be surprised because I don't want to see what I can get because then I'll go, I don't want that.
[34:37.84]I don't want that.
[34:38.38]I don't want that.
[34:38.92]I don't want that.
[34:39.38]I want that.
[34:40.70]And then my brain is like, you're opening this case to get that item, which is not going to happen.
[34:47.93]Right?
[34:51.13]It looks great on the Degreaser.
[35:02.21]That's a smart gambler.
[35:04.83]I don't know if that is, that's not, that statement doesn't hold on.
[35:10.14]Okay.
[35:11.38]Open.
[35:13.04]Smart gambler.
[35:16.56]Oh, oh, it's a good one, but it's all fucked up.
[35:22.52]Where is it?
[35:25.53]No, that's not bad.
[35:26.21]Minimal where?
[35:35.61]It's kind of just like steel.
[35:36.75]Yeah, just stainless steel.
[35:40.53]Scattergun?
[35:41.97]Hmm.
[35:45.63]Put it on the fish?
[35:49.08]What about the knife?
[35:50.76]Hmm.
[35:54.54]Flamethrower?
[35:56.02]I like that a lot.
[35:57.04]Because a flamethrower would be kind of steel, wouldn't it?
[36:00.15]Like a propane tank?
[36:02.47]I kind of like that.
[36:08.48]Put it on the fish.
[36:09.04]Let's see.
[36:10.98]A stainless steel fish.
[36:16.86]Yeah, that actually is really, really cool.
[36:22.14]That's pretty cool.
[36:31.45]Alright, here we go.
[36:32.85]This is it.
[36:33.31]This is why you all waited this long for me to do this.
[36:40.40]What's in the cosmetic case for 2023?
[36:45.36]Alright.
[36:47.08]Okay.
[36:51.92]Okay.
[36:52.36]It's alright.
[37:02.24]It's pretty cool.
[37:06.26]I don't love it.
[37:08.73]But I don't hate it.
[37:09.93]I just wanted more options.
[37:10.87]Alright, and this is it.
[37:19.58]This is the last one.
[37:23.80]No more cases after this.
[37:28.21]Here we go.
[37:36.46]No unusual.
[37:37.46]Oh, well.
[37:41.54]It's not what I was looking for though.
[37:47.71]I got a couple more heavy jackets.
[37:54.75]The frayed edges.
[38:07.53]We need to make the call.
[38:08.67]Does the strange part count as a strange?
[38:12.88]Um, I don't know.
[38:14.46]Can you open, can you unbox strange versions of items?
[38:21.56]I don't think that counts.
[38:22.43]No, I bet like you can unbox a strange, so a strange part.
[38:27.93]I don't think it's like a strange item, right?
[38:31.43]You can get strange war paints.
[38:32.81]Okay.
[38:33.13]Yeah.
[38:35.88]I don't think that counts.
[38:38.17]I think we were referring to, like, orange letters out of the box.
[38:41.70]It's like a strange part.
[38:43.16]Strange weapon, not part.
[38:44.06]Alright, well, there we go.
[38:51.04]Cool.
[38:51.80]I got a new awesome... I'm so glad that I got this.
[38:54.96]I only had to spend... Um... That's kind of like a lot for a pair of fucking shoes.
[39:04.13]Yeah.
[39:05.01]That's fun.
[39:09.90]You should buy 50 more.
[39:13.00]No.
[39:14.38]Okay, if I collect some more, I have some other cases.
[39:18.36]Like old crates.
[39:20.78]The old crates.
[39:23.54]But, eh.
[39:26.81]Maybe another time.
[39:29.77]Crack them open?
[39:30.73]Nah, maybe another time.
[39:32.01]Maybe another time.
[39:35.51]Alright, that's gonna be it.
[39:37.81]Before we go...
[39:40.05]I do want to bring something up.
[39:42.00]So if you're just still hanging out, let me just head over here.
[39:50.08]So I want to bring this up.
[39:51.02]I want to talk about this is really actually very, very serious.
[39:54.53]Um, so I'm not, this is not no joking around right now.
[39:57.37]I'm talking to pretty real, uh, those of you that remember the Nevada science center, science center, Nevada, remember science center, Josh member.
[40:08.80]Well, we got word, we heard, that Josh was in a pretty major accident.
[40:16.23]And it's very, very tragic.
[40:19.13]It's actually really, really sad and really awful.
[40:22.25]And they have a GoFundMe to try to help out.
[40:27.47]And those of you that don't know who this is, if you watch the archaeology stream where GrottoBeast was from, he was on the stream.
[40:35.82]He was a big part of that.
[40:39.46]And can the mods link it?
[40:40.76]Can we get it, like, pinned?
[40:42.00]Yeah, it's really terrible.
[40:46.74]So if you can spare anything, there's a link.
[40:51.56]It's really, really sad, really tragic.
[40:54.56]But he was a great guy, and it's a great family.
[40:57.84]And it's a really, really terrible, tragic thing to happen.
[41:01.66]He made that stream so much more fun.
[41:05.03]So hopefully, you know, we can help out a little if we can.
[41:14.73]Yeah, I just wanted to kind of bring it up.
[41:16.41]Put some attention to it.
[41:25.95]Yeah.
[41:27.81]Yeah, because when we heard about it, it was just like... Like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[41:32.84]No, that's... It's too good of a fucking family.
[41:36.56]Too good of people.
[41:37.98]It really, really is just so... It hurts.
[41:42.30]I don't know him very well, but...
[41:44.77]They came out and they really made that stream something special that it makes me feel terrible.
[41:53.22]Yeah.
[42:00.22]So if you can, it's there.
[42:03.66]Yeah, it's a terrible situation.
[42:16.88]yeah we're we're I'm just when we heard about it I was just devastated this is how do you how do you even what do you even say when you see something like that and you know it's just so but if we can help we will and I I want to at least make sure that I talked about it because
[42:34.93]I know a lot of people really found that stream to be in Grotto Beasts.
[42:37.87]Grotto Beasts has become like a really great success.
[42:40.33]Like it's been really fun.
[42:43.35]Very fortunate over here to have that project be a success as much as it was.
[42:50.98]So we're going to ping this in the Discord too.
[42:52.62]We're going to do an announcement in the Discord.
[42:59.75]Yeah, and best of luck to that family recovering as best as they can.
[43:11.45]Yeah.
[43:12.68]I will see you guys later.
[43:13.78]I'll see you on... Ster's going to be hanging out for a little while, so... Probably next week I do have some stuff that I have to do for work that I need to make sure I take care of.
[43:26.66]So, next week, keep an eye on the sus.
[43:28.96]Ster's going to be here.
[43:33.02]Yeah.
[43:34.07]Take care of yourselves.
[43:37.19]It's great to hang out.
[43:37.99]I know this was a short one, but...
[43:41.35]Yeah, it's fun.
[43:42.41]It's fun just to hang out and just talk.
[43:44.49]Relax.
[43:52.83]Have a great week.
[43:54.87]I'll see you all very soon.
[43:58.27]Take care.
[44:00.81]Cool crates?
[44:01.62]Yeah.
[44:03.66]That was kind of fun, too.
[44:09.50]Opening crates is fun.
[44:12.22]Now I got some new outfits.
[44:15.98]Yeah, see you soon.
[44:16.82]Take care.
[44:17.86]See you next week.
[44:20.53]Oh, there'll be some Grotto Beasts digital tabletop simulator news.
[44:26.45]I know people have been waiting for that.
[44:28.21]It's been being developed for a long time.
[44:30.65]So we're going to have some stuff to talk about.
[44:35.32]So Grotto Beasts is going to be coming back in the digital space.
[44:43.34]Are you going to talk about it next stream?
[44:46.08]Maybe.
[44:46.36]That's very possible.
[44:52.16]Pog, I got no clue what's going on.
[44:54.12]Thanks for the support.
[44:58.92]Thank you.
[45:04.47]Alright.
[45:04.67]I'll see you guys later.
[45:05.75]Take care.
