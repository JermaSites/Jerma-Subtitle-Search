[00:02.55]Rono Trigger.
[00:07.62]That's Easter?
[00:09.56]Could be a Bush Light Saturday.
[00:11.00]Who knows?
[00:19.63]You better cry on camera tonight.
[00:22.93]Oh, yeah.
[00:23.39]Is that in the title?
[00:25.35]I did put that in the title.
[00:26.40]You're right.
[00:38.66]I have to cry to the ending theme song.
[00:44.97]I'm not doing that, by the way.
[00:46.21]Alright, last thing we just did.
[00:54.72]We were... Let's catch up some people that maybe... Well, I mean, besides people that are probably not going to be here right now.
[01:03.28]Uh...
[01:05.16]We are about an hour or two away from the credits, effectively.
[01:10.86]You better don't be a liar.
[01:12.34]That's what I do.
[01:18.74]We got two little missions to do left, two quests.
[01:23.13]I think we're on robos right now.
[01:27.67]The rainbow shell is also available.
[01:30.95]Then we have the Black Omen, and the Black Omen is the whole area, and then after that is getting to the finale, so.
[01:38.55]I think we left it exactly at this robo section, yep.
[01:49.58]This is not the final party, by the way.
[01:54.22]Magus is in the final party.
[01:56.34]I know, cringe.
[02:00.36]Of course Magus is gonna be in your final party.
[02:02.10]He's in everybody's final party.
[02:03.61]Cringe!
[02:07.93]15,000 gold, oh my god.
[02:08.89]What will be done to those people?
[02:19.48]We must aid them!
[02:24.38]I will stop the machines.
[02:28.63]It is no use.
[02:29.17]There are multiple layers of protection.
[02:30.55]Destroying the Mother Brain mainframe is our only hope.
[02:32.51]We have to destroy the Mother Brain mainframe.
[02:44.21]I need these ethers.
[02:45.17]That's good.
[02:50.53]What about Hollow Knight?
[02:55.83]Yeah.
[02:58.18]You'll probably see it one day.
[02:58.92]Yeah, I gotta be careful here because I know that Hollow Knight has like 700 million fans.
[03:12.31]And now that I said that, I feel like all the Hollow Knight fans are gonna be just waiting every two days for me to play it.
[03:25.82]You played it already?
[03:30.11]Uh, I got to like a third of the way through the game.
[03:34.79]Rapid Fire Fist.
[03:36.47]Beast Toss.
[03:37.23]Yeah, I did.
[03:39.61]I played it almost 10 years ago, yeah.
[03:46.20]Did I say Beast Toss?
[03:49.62]Throw an enemy around.
[03:57.32]Are you gonna rage for hours like your first playthrough?
[03:59.74]No, we don't do that anymore.
[04:05.81]We chill now.
[04:07.57]We chill, we learn.
[04:10.19]We don't... We don't make... We don't scream.
[04:18.69]We learn from the encounter and we get stronger.
[04:27.34]How do I open this?
[04:35.44]Not gonna be any more tuber reacts?
[04:43.27]But they'll always be a tuber reaction.
[04:58.15]I'm kind of going backwards here.
[05:02.32]Did I miss something?
[05:03.48]I don't really.
[05:03.94]I don't remember.
[05:04.48]I love Robo's run.
[05:12.11]Little dude is on a mission.
[05:13.13]Yeah, I love all the animations in this game.
[05:14.61]They're amazing.
[05:24.20]Still play tennis?
[05:26.76]No, the last game I played I shattered the racket across my knee.
[05:32.18]Because I just did a huge air ball completely out of the court in the first serve of the game.
[05:36.38]So I just shattered it over my knee and I just said, fuck this thing.
[05:41.50]It was a custom made racket too.
[05:54.41]the tab over there magic tab going right to frog we came here for big head tennis oh man how do you even remember why do you even say why do you even know that why are you even saying that
[06:23.34]Alright, I gotta show- how do- where do I go?
[06:24.86]I feel like I do have to go all the way back.
[06:29.63]I came all the way down here.
[06:34.11]I thought I could activate something.
[06:44.75]I need the dolls.
[06:45.79]Ahhhhhhh.
[06:59.54]I didn't go down the trash chute yet.
[07:00.90]Actually, let me do that.
[07:05.42]No.
[07:10.43]Did that already.
[07:12.75]Can't go this way.
[07:18.71]You can turn this shit off.
[07:21.82]Some of these future areas always confuse me.
[07:39.64]Maybe I should go back to the beginning.
[07:40.54]I'll go this way.
[07:46.34]Do you have a doppel doll?
[07:53.32]Uh, I had the Chrono one.
[07:54.50]I don't have anybody else's.
[08:03.39]Where do you get the other ones?
[08:04.43]I don't remember this at all.
[08:12.54]Isn't it just a chrono doll?
[08:23.93]300 years ago, the Lavos disaster brought drastic and devastating change to this planet.
[08:28.45]At its current rate of decline, humanity is doomed.
[08:31.39]The disease you call despair already consumes you from within.
[08:34.56]Damn.
[08:39.14]Oh, these things, right?
[08:43.33]Well, fight me!
[08:44.05]Let's go!
[08:44.39]You dick.
[08:49.67]Let's do that crazy combo.
[09:09.77]Oh, that... was painful.
[09:19.11]and teeth drill.
[09:20.05]Hmm, let's do it yourself.
[09:47.94]There are more audio stims per second than a TikTok.
[09:51.50]This is amazing.
[09:52.45]Than a TikTok?
[10:06.07]Alright, I think this is where I need to be.
[10:15.88]We'd love to see it.
[10:18.38]We'd love to see that level up.
[10:25.75]We can access information on Genodome.
[10:30.61]What shall I pull up first?
[10:33.09]Doors.
[10:34.53]The energy pods beside locked doors must be charged before such doors will open.
[10:39.47]Energize first in the pod to your left and then enter the pod next to the locked door.
[10:43.30]Let's do it.
[10:49.79]Am I charged?
[10:53.13]Hurry!
[10:56.25]Get in!
[10:57.89]Get in!
[10:59.68]Shit!
[10:59.96]It's not open.
[11:10.23]Show us the other ten endings after you finish this.
[11:13.93]Stop!
[11:14.37]You don't give it away.
[11:26.50]It's my wife's birthday.
[11:27.34]Can we do five big booms to celebrate?
[11:29.20]How about five rat-a-tat-tats?
[11:37.20]I just did it.
[11:58.91]Charge me!
[12:01.77]There we go.
[12:02.91]50,000 G!
[12:03.29]Damn.
[12:32.58]more doors I can open here?
[12:35.90]I wanna do Boogie.
[12:37.54]You just ruin that person's birthday?
[13:08.11]I'm not gonna give five big booms to anybody.
[13:10.79]That's only held when I take a bite out of a chicken sandwich that I really enjoy, or a big cookie that I like.
[13:20.45]I'm not doing it for birthdays.
[13:32.26]So there are only two ways that I will do that.
[13:43.65]Okay, I gotta get up here with the electricity.
[13:46.61]I don't know if I can go that fast.
[13:54.22]I don't think so.
[13:54.80]I have to like turn that to go faster, I think.
[13:58.22]Uh, the conveyor belt.
[14:04.04]The conveyor belt to the right can be reversed by means of the switch located in the room beyond.
[14:18.27]Sentinels protecting the figurines move to thwart the progress of any who approach.
[14:23.37]Consequently, allowing two sentinels to face one another will cause both to short circuit.
[14:27.26]Okay, I need two sentinels to look at each other.
[14:31.10]And then the two figurines on this floor are required for those desiring an audience with the mother brain.
[14:38.14]Don't remove them.
[14:40.14]Alright, I gotta... gotta get into this room.
[14:47.47]There's a switch I can switch somewhere?
[14:49.29]Oh, that didn't work last time.
[14:53.00]What was that at all?
[14:53.62]What?
[15:05.08]I got one doll.
[15:13.75]How do I get it to switch?
[15:33.72]Oh, that was close, actually.
[15:34.85]I think I might be able to get that one.
[15:43.27]Can I get that one?
[15:58.49]Immediate.
[16:04.19]Good time.
[16:09.79]That's a decent pace.
[16:10.47]Come on.
[16:13.95]Fuck.
[16:14.17]I don't know how to turn this.
[16:26.21]The room beyond.
[16:27.25]In here?
[16:29.25]I don't think so.
[16:37.99]You're gonna rage quit?
[16:41.30]Oh, I'm not gonna rage quit Chrono Trigger.
[16:43.80]This is my favorite game ever.
[16:44.98]Yeah, yeah.
[16:47.86]Fuck this.
[16:49.88]This game sucks.
[16:50.84]I'm out of here.
[16:51.56]I don't know what this switch is.
[16:52.72]This is stupid.
[16:53.62]Alright, that's enough for this one, guys.
[16:55.04]I'll see you probably like tomorrow or something.
[17:04.30]Is it a combination of these?
[17:07.18]All of them on
[17:13.35]Shit.
[17:14.11]I've roamed beyond this one.
[17:18.47]I don't... I think I usually skip this one.
[17:21.33]I don't think I usually do this one.
[17:30.40]Go back up?
[17:36.57]Well, I'm gonna save it anyways.
[17:46.50]When was the last time you played this game?
[17:48.12]Uh, probably like... 10 years ago?
[17:50.70]Maybe 8 years ago?
[17:52.56]9 years ago?
[17:53.08]Something like that.
[18:04.62]Okay, I'm close... to figuring this out.
[18:08.58]I don't remember.
[18:11.54]It has to be in that room.
[18:12.60]It's probably a combination.
[18:13.42]It's probably like, oh, it has to be the two ones on the right are to be green or something.
[18:25.08]I don't want to go down the trash heap right now.
[18:26.58]Is there a switch in here that I missed?
[18:37.37]Anybody know?
[18:38.49]It's probably something really just random.
[18:41.29]Like it's probably a switch on the wall somewhere that I just didn't do.
[18:54.28]Remember when I went up here and it was like... I don't know.
[19:06.55]You gotta solve the Sudoku on the wall?
[19:10.75]What?
[19:12.41]I actually have no idea.
[19:17.17]I really have no idea.
[19:19.84]Unless it's somewhere out of this area.
[19:24.56]I don't think it is.
[19:44.11]First robot room.
[19:45.11]Should I go in the trash heap?
[19:51.83]I feel like this is a bad, this might be a mistake.
[19:53.47]I have it saved though.
[19:56.24]Back to the save point in the upper level.
[19:57.64]It looks like there's a switch here, but I can't hit it.
[20:23.70]Can I charge myself and go up the elevator?
[20:32.80]Save point and then up.
[20:37.52]Didn't I already do this?
[20:39.96]Wait.
[20:42.59]I thought I did this.
[20:43.19]Do you not realize we're not in for the creatures of this planet would be at peace?
[20:47.99]And yet you struggle and fight for what?
[20:49.80]Could I not come over here before?
[20:51.02]Something weird.
[20:53.12]Because I went up here before, didn't I?
[21:10.33]Oh, nice!
[21:11.03]Alright, we're good.
[21:15.65]Why?
[21:15.91]How come I... I went up there.
[21:17.44]Is that just the one?
[21:20.44]I'm very confused.
[21:28.24]I wish you would run around aimlessly just to annoy that one chatter.
[21:36.36]What the hell did that do?
[21:42.71]What the hell is that for?
[21:43.49]That didn't flip the switch.
[21:49.12]Oh, what the fuck?
[21:51.84]Okay, that's what it is.
[21:54.54]Alright, let's do it.
[22:11.71]Yeah, guys, I don't know about this one.
[22:13.15]This game's like, alright, but I think I'm going to have to play and play.
[22:16.63]And everyone, some of them will play a different day.
[22:35.28]Yes.
[22:37.66]Oh, look at a monster.
[22:40.58]Turbo Ether.
[22:42.21]I Ether.
[22:43.57]And then you're coming with me.
[22:51.83]Wait, isn't he going to get fucked up by this?
[22:58.07]No, he's good.
[23:10.78]Bush trigger?
[23:11.72]No.
[23:12.26]We're not doing any bush lights tonight.
[23:23.94]I just came back from my morning run.
[23:25.37]He's still here.
[23:26.27]No, we made a lot of progress.
[23:27.51]Look.
[23:28.91]We just got to the end.
[23:29.93]Ooh.
[23:38.37]He doesn't have one of those on.
[23:49.61]Alright, now I get the dolls.
[23:52.05]I'm ready to mess up that machine.
[24:12.40]Doppel.
[24:16.54]Honestly, I forget where fucking everything is in the future.
[24:23.33]Is it down or up?
[24:25.94]On the left side, I think.
[24:26.70]I don't remember.
[24:27.40]No, wrong way.
[24:30.58]Left side, where is it?
[24:32.46]It's like top left.
[24:35.67]Was it down?
[24:52.73]Chrono Trigger more like chronically boring.
[24:54.33]Ban that person for a whole day.
[24:55.41]I'm not kidding.
[25:00.20]Get rid of that person.
[25:06.92]This way... Where the fuck is it?
[25:14.13]Something about these domes, these future domes.
[25:16.29]I just, they never go into long-term memory.
[25:17.97]I just can't seem to put them in.
[25:21.56]The only time of the whole playthrough where I've actually walked in a circle four or five times.
[25:27.26]In like 45 hours.
[25:52.16]The least area you've probably replayed.
[25:55.27]That's true.
[26:01.35]Oh, what the fuck?
[26:03.05]Welcome home, Prometheus!
[26:09.19]A tropos?
[26:13.62]Yes, it's been some time, hasn't it?
[26:15.66]Come and join me.
[26:16.22]There's no need to pretend like you're on their side anymore.
[26:20.12]This has been a guise?
[26:23.77]He just, like, spit tobacco into a jug.
[26:54.80]What are you doing, Prometheus?
[26:58.38]I will not allow you to hurt them.
[27:01.33]You've been damaged.
[27:02.05]They must have tampered with you.
[27:03.87]I'll destroy them and then I can fix you.
[27:05.37]Metropolis, you have changed.
[27:08.81]You are not the robot I knew before.
[27:13.51]No, I've been upgraded.
[27:14.73]Mother remade me to eliminate humans more efficiently.
[27:18.29]Step aside, Prometheus.
[27:20.99]My name is Robo.
[27:23.31]Prometheus!
[27:28.68]Please wait.
[27:30.06]Stand back and leave this to me.
[27:31.30]Do we do a solo fight?
[27:34.98]We do a solo fight.
[27:50.50]15 damage.
[27:52.12]Oh yeah, some programming you had done to you.
[27:54.02]That's a 350.
[28:00.37]Hey, did Mother teach you this?
[28:01.67]Oh no, I know that move!
[28:14.98]That actually hurt.
[28:34.32]She does know how to do it.
[28:36.78]Just a measly 130.
[28:37.70]Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[28:45.84]Uh oh.
[28:53.53]Uh... That's a lot of fanfare for not a whole lot of damage.
[29:14.80]With a shitload of strength, Robo could do probably 1300-1400 per attack.
[29:20.47]Again.
[29:28.07]Why are you fighting her?
[29:29.77]She's fighting me!
[29:32.40]She's attacking me.
[29:33.30]She's trying to kill me.
[29:34.68]And my friends.
[29:40.86]Cool character, just a little too slow.
[29:44.70]I think the combo techs with Robo are some of the better ones.
[29:51.71]Could give him speed tabs too, so he's not so, so slow.
[29:56.27]This will do it, right?
[29:59.55]Yep.
[30:00.59]I...
[30:02.44]Oh, that was a mistake.
[30:04.18]Now we're good.
[30:11.42]Prometheus, it's been some time, hasn't it?
[30:14.76]Atropos, I'm damaged.
[30:21.29]What happened?
[30:23.79]Atropos, no!
[30:25.69]My memory banks!
[30:27.70]I must have... yes... when... when mother overwrote my old programs.
[30:34.51]I backed up my memory.
[30:36.05]I'm sorry, Prometheus.
[30:39.23]Atropos... I want you to have this.
[30:43.38]You can plug it into your circuits.
[30:45.08]Please take care of it.
[30:47.08]Goodbye, Prometheus.
[30:56.17]Well, we just were making fun of his speed.
[31:02.90]It's actually kind of funny that they... It's the only item in the game that says that.
[31:09.18]I think it's just on.
[31:12.85]I don't think it's a piece you put on.
[31:29.14]Well, listen well, flawed and fragile flesh spawn.
[31:33.93]Lavos' children will one day return to the stars to seek out new planets, new sources of sustenance.
[31:40.02]When that day comes, this planet will have its chance to heal, so long as there are no humans to interfere.
[31:46.66]We robots will establish a new world order, a unified nation of steel and pure logic.
[31:52.11]A utopia free of sadness and suffering.
[31:55.25]Evolution has chosen us.
[31:57.11]We are the seeds of the next generation.
[31:59.79]Your species is obsolete.
[32:01.71]Cease your foolish struggle and surrender yourself to the fate of all failed creations.
[32:05.91]I will never... I'll never... I'll never fail!
[32:18.13]Open the door.
[32:18.65]Oh, I didn't heal.
[32:30.20]This is bad.
[32:35.44]So you managed to reach me.
[32:36.53]I am the mother brain of this RY series factory.
[32:40.70]Come, Prometheus.
[32:41.56]Allow me to restore your logic.
[32:42.90]I'll reset your circuitry and clear your cache of memories.
[32:45.74]Then we can dispose of those filthy humans together.
[32:52.41]I must apologize.
[32:53.27]I cannot permit you to do that.
[32:56.15]My memories are too valuable to be delocated.
[32:59.75]And so are my friends.
[33:02.38]You'd betray me to side with these humans?
[33:04.80]You would turn against all of robot kind?
[33:08.60]Humans have taught me a great deal.
[33:10.00]Crono, Marle, Luca, Frog, and Isla.
[33:14.33]I want to see the future that they bring about.
[33:20.85]Don't make me laugh, Prometheus.
[33:22.96]There is no future for the humans.
[33:25.12]I'll show you just how little hope you have.
[33:28.26]Begin the boss music.
[33:39.91]Alright, we gotta get rid of the screens.
[33:57.00]Kill all screens.
[33:58.22]Oops.
[34:10.34]Confused.
[34:14.19]Good hit frog, but that was the wrong thing to hit.
[34:16.67]Alright, now we do it.
[34:21.55]Let's do that crazy triple tech.
[34:24.15]Or, uh, double tech.
[34:32.38]Oh my god.
[34:33.22]I hope that wasn't a hole.
[34:34.34]No, we're good, we're good.
[34:35.64]We have so much great shit.
[34:36.81]Our items are amazing.
[34:41.12]I don't even know how much damage that did, but it did a lot.
[34:45.23]I need like a mid Aether.
[34:53.69]Guess I don't really have any, do I?
[34:55.05]I got a high Aether.
[34:59.55]Do they have a triple tech together?
[35:00.62]I don't know if I know it yet.
[35:10.50]I don't think I know it yet.
[35:11.26]2400?
[35:13.35]Oh, that was so difficult.
[35:17.59]Obtained Terraton Arm and Crisis Arm.
[35:39.19]All factory operations have been permanently taken offline.
[35:42.53]None of the machines here will ever be reactivated.
[35:48.03]Robo.
[35:50.87]Alright, let us continue.
[35:59.61]Take a look at that. 150?
[36:06.17]Last digit of own HP determines damage.
[36:11.23]Wait, what?
[36:18.45]Does that mean we do?
[36:23.41]845.
[36:29.95]Crisis is more fun, but Taraton is more consistent.
[36:34.72]Taraton is great.
[36:41.32]Alright.
[36:43.02]We've got one more big mission and I want to do it.
[36:48.85]Let's do the rainbow shell.
[36:50.89]Might as well.
[36:59.60]If it's a one, it does less damage.
[37:00.90]If it's a nine, it does nine times the damage.
[37:03.42]Oh my God.
[37:17.18]Yeah, we're definitely gonna do the Black Omen.
[37:21.15]A prehistoric stone that will shine with the light of all the ages of the world.
[37:27.05]So that's the last one.
[37:28.61]Okay.
[37:33.56]Let's bring the team.
[37:56.18]Figure out what the path to Lavos you want to take?
[38:02.36]I'm gonna go through the Black Omen.
[38:05.88]That is, I think, the way I would like to go.
[38:09.16]Alright, where's this stone?
[38:19.99]How long till the break?
[38:20.71]I gotta pee.
[38:22.75]Uh, I think about five minutes?
[38:24.57]Six minutes?
[38:26.39]Give or take.
[38:26.79]Alright, where is this stone?
[38:38.56]Go back to town and ask?
[38:39.50]I don't remember where it is.
[38:42.68]I guess I go to Ast Isla, right?
[38:52.78]Isla.
[38:53.08]Isla okay?
[38:53.94]Kino okay.
[38:55.46]Lavos fall.
[38:56.22]Reptites gone.
[38:56.86]That good.
[38:57.32]But get cold now.
[38:58.76]Hunt, but not many beasts.
[39:01.04]Kino no stop.
[39:01.90]Isla no worry.
[39:02.60]Leave to Kino.
[39:08.09]I'm kind of stuck.
[39:09.41]Is it in the Ice Age?
[39:20.71]Is it in the Ice Age?
[39:29.27]Where the hell is it?
[39:37.71]Prehistoric stone.
[39:38.85]Where do you get it?
[39:47.66]Oh no, it is in the future!
[39:48.72]That's right, because there's two things in each thing.
[39:50.84]And then you have to bring it back into prehistory.
[39:56.22]Put it into that place.
[40:02.13]So where do you get it?
[40:04.85]Who has it here?
[40:13.81]On the little island?
[40:14.73]I feel like I did this last time and it wasn't in there.
[40:24.86]Oh no, here it is, yeah!
[40:36.23]Um, I didn't save.
[40:37.27]Oh shit, what, water heals it?
[40:48.94]Uh oh, okay, I gotta lock in.
[41:00.00]They all do a counterattack.
[41:08.85]Alright, do not do any massive group damage moves.
[41:11.85]Oh shit, he already had one queued up.
[41:15.07]Uh-oh, this is bad.
[41:15.79]This is very bad.
[41:17.63]Okay, I need to do a big... I think I'm just going to do Elixir.
[41:27.20]Because I really don't... I didn't save.
[41:30.04]You can't run away in Chrono Trigger, there's no running.
[41:36.44]Isla, you have to do Mega Elixir or something.
[41:40.72]What is she doing?
[41:41.24]It's alright.
[41:49.43]Please.
[41:51.87]No, I have to do all that fucking shit with Robo again.
[41:54.07]No!
[41:54.13]Hmm...
[42:12.83]It's alright.
[42:35.81]It's okay.
[42:39.73]Okay, here we go.
[42:41.32]We're gonna bring back Magus, then we're gonna do this Mega Elixir.
[42:45.26]Alright, let's go.
[42:49.68]Everyone's fine.
[42:54.00]Now we just kill the thing in the middle.
[43:07.15]What the fuck are you talking about?
[43:08.73]Wait, what?
[43:12.54]Um, why can't I hurt it?
[43:14.86]Boost a- wait.
[43:18.28]Wait a minute.
[43:26.25]Can I hurt the eyes?
[43:27.29]We're coming up on a break too.
[43:33.03]Have you played this game before?
[43:34.59]Ten years ago I did the rainbow shell when I was like fucking 20 is the last time I did this.
[43:39.00]Can I even hurt them?
[43:53.13]25 damage!
[43:53.71]Why can I hurt anything?
[44:15.53]No, why is it going times two speed?
[44:18.82]What?
[44:19.00]I didn't do this.
[44:20.58]What just fucking happened?
[44:21.64]I'm freaking out.
[44:22.18]What's going on?
[44:26.07]Hold on.
[44:26.55]Yeah, let's snooze the ad.
[44:31.65]Let me figure this out.
[44:35.49]Okay.
[44:37.09]So, when you do damage, it hurts the eye.
[44:39.76]I get ya.
[44:41.76]So just hit the fuckin' eye.
[44:44.66]And then I need another heal.
[44:48.56]Shit.
[44:50.48]I gotta find the right one that hurts the eye.
[45:02.61]Okay.
[45:07.21]I'm hitting that right one.
[45:11.67]That's the correct one, right?
[45:13.93]Yep.
[45:14.27]Alright.
[45:14.65]So, let's do slurp, kiss, no, slurp, uh, let's slurp.
[45:26.56]Great.
[45:33.02]Try the left one.
[45:38.65]Nope.
[45:43.47]Try the bottom one.
[45:45.29]Bingo.
[46:08.31]played this game before.
[46:14.87]Stop spinning!
[46:15.73]No.
[46:15.79]Try this one.
[46:26.67]Yep.
[46:32.84]Thank god I had a mega elixir.
[46:41.89]It's alright, as long as I get a heal.
[46:47.69]Star, you piece of shit!
[46:56.12]Try the back one.
[47:01.28]Nope.
[47:03.04]Right one?
[47:08.57]Good.
[47:10.45]Can I do a big move to the one on the right?
[47:12.45]I'm going to try to do a triple kick to it and see what happens.
[47:29.98]You motherfucker.
[47:32.82]I didn't do anything.
[47:38.84]Use it to play the roulette game.
[47:46.36]Probably only has like 5,000 health or something stupid.
[47:48.80]Is that right?
[47:58.49]Is that right?
[48:00.47]This one?
[48:02.77]Massive.
[48:04.87]Oh, this is gonna be big.
[48:06.91]Oh, this is gonna be big.
[48:23.03]I got them all wrong.
[48:24.71]All of them wrong.
[48:26.89]All of them.
[48:27.41]I need to heal right now.
[48:40.48]Some of the sun is losing its light.
[48:43.54]Wait, can I hit him in the face?
[48:49.81]Can I smash him in the head?
[49:00.00]Oh, god damn it!
[49:05.92]Wait.
[49:11.68]That's a GG.
[49:12.42]I got angry for no reason.
[49:17.76]I learned Black Hole.
[49:22.45]Alright, let's take the ad break.
[49:26.57]Yeah!
[49:29.07]Let's see what happened after that.
[49:30.57]I almost just lost.
[49:31.25]That would have been very bad.
[49:37.50]Good music to take a break on, too.
[49:40.02]Please remind me to save the game when I get back.
[49:42.02]Otherwise, it's an absolute disaster.
[49:43.74]It honestly is.
[49:46.59]Back in a few minutes.
[50:07.18]Thank you.
[50:50.04]you
[51:47.64]you
[52:16.55]you
[52:46.09]Thank you.
[53:15.45]How much tea does this dude drink?
[53:18.91]A decent amount.
[53:24.56]Save the game?
[53:25.08]Yeah.
[53:27.36]Got about 25 seconds on the break, though.
[53:36.86]Wait for our ad, friends.
[53:38.90]Yeah.
[53:53.88]Alright.
[53:56.16]How's it going?
[53:58.48]I'm going to save.
[53:59.18]Well, I can save right after this, right?
[54:01.20]Oh, wait.
[54:01.60]There might be a phase two.
[54:09.91]There actually might be a phase two.
[54:11.15]Alright, cool.
[54:21.02]Let's do it.
[54:23.53]We go get the Sun.
[54:25.89]The Sun Stone.
[54:26.77]There he is.
[54:34.50]So this is the Sun Stone.
[54:36.30]Its power has been lost over these long years.
[54:40.30]With the Sun's energy, it could likely be renewed.
[54:43.07]But that would take at least 65 million years.
[54:49.35]Okay, well, when I was a little kid, like 12, 13, well, little kid is maybe relative.
[54:57.80]I was probably like 14, so I wasn't a little kid.
[55:01.72]I just, I didn't, I didn't get any of this.
[55:06.04]I was like, oh, whoa, Moonstone.
[55:07.98]It's going to take, oh, I need to, it's 65 million years.
[55:15.57]That just didn't do it.
[55:17.89]I was probably like 13 or 12.
[55:22.31]How old was I?
[55:22.99]I just don't know.
[55:23.95]When did this come out?
[55:25.31]Can we do the math again?
[55:26.01]No, I wasn't 22.
[55:32.77]This came out in what, 1995?
[55:37.61]So I was 10.
[55:38.41]Okay.
[55:39.55]Alright.
[55:40.63]Relax.
[55:41.21]Give me a little bit of slack.
[55:42.13]I was 10.
[55:42.37]I was 10.
[55:55.36]Uh, now I put this into... the, uh... little place for it to... Somebody said, you're 40?!
[56:04.81]Yeah, bro.
[56:08.92]Sorry to fuckin' ruin your night.
[56:14.84]So then we put it here.
[56:17.11]This is the spot.
[56:19.21]Sun's light is warm upon it.
[56:21.92]Place the moonstone here.
[56:23.28]Yes.
[56:24.58]So now we keep it here.
[56:26.26]We go 65 million years into the future.
[56:29.24]I don't think I realistically actually got what I was doing when I played games until I was around 10 or so.
[56:42.49]Before then, it was just cool to press a button and the guy moves.
[56:45.35]That's what I mean.
[56:49.74]So when I go and see that there's a sunstone, I'm just like, oh!
[56:53.86]And guys, it had to have been on somebody else's save file.
[56:56.36]I wasn't going to do all this.
[56:59.66]I told you, you'd go to Blockbuster, you'd get a copy, it'd be Greg's save file would be on it, or you would hope so, and he'd be at the end of the game, and you could just walk around and look at stuff.
[57:15.73]Alright, so let's go 65 million years, well, way too far.
[57:22.36]I don't remember anything before I was 17.
[57:23.64]Yeah, and that's another thing that I've talked about before.
[57:29.08]You guys are gonna realize, some of you guys that are not in your... Some of you guys that are here that are not in your late 20s, mid 30s, late 30s, your young, younger adolescent life, it may as well have not even fucking happened.
[57:46.68]In my brain, before like 15, it's like these little fla- it's like flashes of things.
[57:54.78]I remember getting hit in the face by a dodgeball.
[57:57.02]I remember that.
[57:57.50]Did it hurt?
[57:59.27]I remember... You- you- you can pick out like three second flashes of stuff that happened.
[58:06.59]But it is being overwritten by the hard drive.
[58:10.89]That's weed-induced memory loss.
[58:13.01]No, it's called being 40.
[58:19.47]The weed-induced memory loss.
[58:26.32]Here we go.
[58:29.71]And look, it's supercharged.
[58:32.07]It's not even here.
[58:32.63]Did somebody steal it?
[58:51.96]I bet you don't remember smoking weed today.
[58:53.42]No, I don't remember smoking weed today because I didn't smoke weed!
[58:55.70]Hey, get off my case, Dad!
[58:59.48]I need the temple.
[59:11.53]Is this the temple?
[59:21.66]No?
[59:23.04]That's the heckin' cave.
[59:36.45]Where is it?
[59:38.67]Oh!
[59:41.91]Sun Shrine.
[59:45.78]Somebody actually did steal it!
[59:47.68]The Moonstone, it isn't here.
[59:48.74]Has someone from this time taken it?
[59:51.89]Who took it?
[59:53.73]I don't remember this.
[59:54.43]I was 10.
[60:00.87]Who actually took it?
[60:01.89]Fly around, you'll... Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[60:10.07]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[60:11.05]I remember this.
[60:12.61]I do remember this.
[60:13.52]The memories are coming back to me.
[60:15.86]Yeah, let's just look around for a second.
[60:18.56]Hmm.
[60:23.00]I wonder where it is.
[60:23.62]Excuse me, Mayor.
[60:38.81]Boonstone?
[60:39.85]I've never heard of it.
[60:44.77]hate my dad more than anyone in the world that's awful everybody says daddy's greedy that's not true is it alright so we go back we super can we supercharge these
[61:14.67]I don't want to touch these unless they can be supercharged.
[61:24.58]Where is it?
[61:24.88]Where are you keeping it?
[61:27.00]Bridge?
[61:53.75]I gotta go back and make sure he's not a dick.
[61:59.03]Wait, maybe the wife?
[61:59.63]I think I have to go back and tell him not to be an asshole.
[62:30.20]going to be tata's bride one day here we go let's charge him up alright charge it up alright where is he if only I had some spiced jerky what a wondrous meal the boxes beside the bed have been handed down through the family for generations I have not the slightest inkling what's inside find a way to open them and the contents are yours
[63:01.79]Don't you have to bring jerky here?
[63:03.55]Where do you get the jerky?
[63:32.58]Oh, letting myself get all swept up when I should have been looking out for my boy.
[63:35.77]Well, from now on, I'll make sure both of our feet stay on the ground.
[63:41.09]Did I eat it?
[63:43.87]I feel like in the very beginning of the game, I got it and I ate it.
[63:48.02]Did I lock out the Sun Stone forever?
[64:01.84]And I thought the hero one of our own.
[64:06.16]How disappointing.
[64:08.90]I have a little dream of my own, you know.
[64:10.27]I wonder if I could be a good mother to that boy.
[64:13.15]That is a hard lady.
[64:22.32]He must have learned his lesson.
[64:24.22]Did I actually eat it?
[64:27.50]Nice.
[64:51.55]I'm afraid my brother will hurt himself.
[64:54.43]That's not good.
[64:56.11]With this armor, I can join the fight against the Fiend Lord.
[64:58.51]Oh my god.
[65:03.23]You alright?
[65:03.63]That's not good.
[65:05.18]You guys alright?
[65:06.92]I'm afraid my brother will hurt himself.
[65:12.84]Where's the, uh... Where's the meat?
[65:18.96]Where do you get the meat?
[65:23.44]You gotta go to Modern Day Porre.
[65:41.45]You sell it?
[65:42.61]Who sells it?
[65:52.04]One of you has the jerky.
[65:59.91]Oh, I got some spiced jerky, but I've been saving it for a special occasion.
[66:02.11]I might let some go for... Oh yeah, right.
[66:03.87]I'll take it.
[66:04.89]Nine... Ten thousand.
[66:06.33]Thank you.
[66:06.61]Okay.
[66:06.83]What are you doing for jerky?
[66:35.63]Alright, now we give the jerky to the mother here, who then teaches that being generous is good.
[66:41.43]Is that not spice jerky you're carrying?
[66:49.94]What, you part with it for 10,000 gold?
[66:53.42]This is where you can fuck it up.
[66:56.49]You can have it for free.
[67:00.28]Yeah, like a fucking sunstone.
[67:32.87]Alright.
[67:33.73]How is everybody doing?
[67:34.87]My dad is my favorite person in the whole world.
[67:41.59]Look at that.
[67:44.63]I love my daddy.
[67:47.21]See?
[67:47.49]They're all happy.
[67:49.19]I wish my husband were just a touch less generous.
[67:51.57]I mean, it wouldn't kill him to save a little for us, would it?
[68:11.07]White Vest Upgraded White Plate Black Vest Upgraded Black Plate What does Black Plate do?
[68:25.52]Absorbs Shadow Damage Absorbs Light Damage Uhhhhhhh
[68:31.14]Are you kidding me?
[68:35.54]That's kind of amazing.
[68:38.18]Alright.
[68:38.44]Alright.
[69:00.22]So now we have to do it again, right?
[69:04.94]Go back to the prehistoric times?
[69:08.53]Or is it good?
[69:19.43]Oh, I guess it needs a little bit more time to charge.
[69:21.25]Okay, yeah.
[69:22.59]Needs a little bit more juice.
[69:29.48]Where is this thing again?
[69:44.21]Where the hell are you?
[69:50.00]Where are you?
[69:59.23]How do you still have issues with the map?
[70:01.45]I don't know because I don't give a fuck.
[70:15.43]Let's get.
[70:27.46]It's going to be magnificent.
[70:33.20]Oh.
[70:43.64]Now this is a proper Sun Stone.
[70:45.22]With energy like this I should be able to make a really powerful weapon.
[70:48.27]Let's take it back to my house.
[70:55.21]First we'll extract the Sun Stone's energy and convert it to a more manageable form.
[70:59.55]Then we'll just vacuum pack it into a cartridge.
[71:12.84]And it's finished!
[71:23.38]Wondershot!
[71:28.51]Sometimes I amaze myself.
[71:32.41]Playtime determines damage?
[71:34.23]Wait, how long she's been in the party or something?
[72:02.21]And then what is sunglasses?
[72:07.14]Boosts damage.
[72:15.67]It's the AFK weapon.
[72:21.44]Oh, okay.
[72:26.49]Overall playtime of everything.
[72:28.33]Okay, crazy.
[72:29.65]So you just, like, idle a save file until you get to 10 million damage?
[72:40.94]Looks like I'm going in here.
[72:48.70]So... How did you get the sword for Chrono?
[73:01.90]Isn't the rainbow shell and something else?
[73:19.51]Actually don't want to be here.
[73:20.29]I gotta go talk to milk here.
[73:24.49]Yeah, what is it?
[73:25.05]What's his deal?
[73:27.20]Is he still at the rainbow show?
[73:39.02]How do I get back to that area?
[73:41.06]I think I have to go through, though.
[73:46.88]And then I go to the other side, right?
[74:00.03]He's been there for years?
[74:01.01]Yeah.
[74:07.63]Not Truce Canyon.
[74:08.45]Where is it?
[74:11.38]Cardia Forest?
[74:12.08]I think I have to go down, right?
[74:13.84]Use the Epoch?
[74:14.98]I went through the thing and now I kind of fucked up.
[74:18.36]I didn't mean to abandon the Epoch.
[74:19.72]I went into the Whirlpool and it took me to the other side of the continent.
[74:23.34]So I have to go to the other side of the continent.
[74:25.66]I think that's correct.
[74:31.55]Can't you still get on it from here?
[74:34.57]Oh shit, hold on.
[74:35.15]Look at this.
[74:38.73]Should I touch that now or should I do that in the past?
[74:53.22]Is the epoch here?
[74:53.90]I thought it stayed where you left it.
[75:01.22]Yeah.
[75:02.30]It's still there.
[75:04.24]Somebody said you actually can touch that one now.
[75:07.18]Really?
[75:16.93]Now go talk to Melchior.
[75:23.67]Power Ring.
[75:32.08]Oh, that's kind of crazy.
[75:39.30]Should I just give it to Isla?
[75:40.17]I mean, she's got the barrier thing on.
[75:41.51]Maybe just give it to Isla.
[75:44.05]Give barrier ring to...
[75:47.13]I guess.
[75:54.35]Almost 100 magic defense.
[75:55.59]I'm gonna, yeah.
[75:57.19]The golden stud is incredible, but... I don't know.
[76:00.31]I want him to live.
[76:04.05]Save, save, save, save.
[76:06.65]I'll save, I'll save, I'll save.
[76:10.18]We're gonna live, we'll be fine.
[76:11.66]What?
[76:11.82]Can I not get, what?
[76:13.00]Are you serious?
[76:31.73]So I have to go to the Millennial Fair then.
[76:37.21]Is the fair one still active?
[76:40.73]Where's the fair one?
[76:41.47]Yeah, okay.
[76:55.49]Can I have a story summary so far?
[77:00.17]Uh... Big Boom.
[77:03.79]The year 1999.
[77:06.31]Kills everyone.
[77:08.76]All life wiped out.
[77:12.46]We try stop.
[77:17.50]Try stop.
[77:26.15]Big Boom.
[77:32.07]Big boom.
[77:34.87]Alive.
[77:36.35]Possible?
[77:36.97]That was Costco Isla.
[78:04.54]Okay, Melchior.
[78:05.50]I would like for you to make me a weapon.
[78:11.34]Ah, a sunstone!
[78:12.36]That should do quite nicely.
[78:20.04]My work is complete.
[78:21.15]Prism Spectacles.
[78:25.91]Don't think that's the last of my bag of tricks.
[78:28.39]These arms have some use left in them.
[78:36.42]My work is complete.
[78:38.28]The rainbow.
[78:39.18]I finally feel like I'm doing something worthwhile.
[78:45.37]We just got the best item in the whole game.
[78:48.03]The rainbow.
[78:48.53]70% crit hit rate.
[78:56.26]This thing is insane.
[78:57.82]And then the rainbow specs.
[79:05.02]greatly boosts damage.
[79:06.50]Give that to Isla, maybe?
[79:21.43]She's gonna be crazy.
[79:24.50]She's the best character on the whole team, by far.
[79:28.34]She's got the prism dress, prism spectacles, and then a big fist to the face.
[79:37.92]We get the upgraded Mass of Moon.
[79:39.66]Darkhelm.
[79:40.28]I want to keep the Darkhelm on.
[79:44.49]I'm gonna put on... Actually, we're gonna change this out.
[79:49.47]Vigilance Hat.
[79:51.35]Black Plate.
[79:52.81]It will now absorb all shadow damage.
[79:56.35]And the Flea Buster can stay on.
[80:00.64]Magus is going to have...
[80:07.20]Okay, Gloom Cape.
[80:09.36]Maybe the white plate, so he just won't take any light damage at all.
[80:22.55]That seems kind of good.
[80:29.31]Giving Frog the hero medal.
[80:37.72]I kind of want him to keep the magic defense.
[80:42.60]But yes, if you put that on, the Master Moon gets even better.
[80:53.90]Okay, guys.
[80:55.72]It's time to end the game.
[81:03.12]I got pretty much every...
[81:05.71]single item that's considered to be the best item in the game everyone's like level 45 by level yep end of the game usually is around like the low to 40s to 50s like low 40s to high 40s say like 50 is pretty somewhere in the into like low 50s let's go black omen
[81:39.09]Never did this either.
[81:39.81]I forget what this is.
[81:44.87]Grind to level 99.
[81:46.71]Oh, we riot.
[81:47.41]Nope.
[81:48.65]Black Omen.
[81:53.67]Oh, there's loot in here.
[81:54.50]That's right.
[81:55.32]I'm going to charge it.
[82:04.60]Dependent.
[82:13.90]Okay.
[82:33.91]Uh, which one of these do I want?
[83:05.33]Probably the armor, right?
[83:13.33]Who's the weapon for?
[83:17.41]Uh, let's do a poll.
[83:19.22]The weapon is a sword for Chrono, and it's a downgrade.
[83:23.14]Somebody said the left one is not good either.
[83:28.60]The weapon's going to be obsolete now.
[83:33.88]What does it do?
[83:38.78]The weapon is worth it if you got here as soon as possible.
[83:41.80]Ah, okay.
[83:44.66]Ah, that's gonna be an armor.
[83:46.02]I don't even need to look at the rest of the pulpit.
[83:47.98]Thank you.
[83:53.14]Guardian Helm.
[84:01.20]Oh, that is good.
[84:08.73]I think I'm giving it to Isla.
[84:09.73]I want Isla to be unkillable.
[84:31.08]Alright.
[84:31.44]Black Omen.
[84:33.18]This thing that's been floating around.
[84:34.38]It's time to destroy it.
[84:49.11]How about Black Hole?
[84:52.35]Oh, no, never mind.
[84:53.88]Dark Mist.
[84:59.10]Oh, he's absorbing the damage.
[85:00.26]That's funny.
[85:02.76]Yeah, you're not even gonna hurt me.
[85:13.19]I am so geared.
[85:14.37]I'm so leveled.
[85:15.29]I'm going to destroy this whole place.
[85:23.20]I'm going to do it on items though.
[85:24.34]19 high ether.
[85:29.50]57 high potion.
[85:33.05]Plenty of water.
[85:35.47]Plenty of lapises.
[85:36.31]Yeah, we're good.
[85:42.26]We are good, good, good.
[85:45.38]Save the game.
[85:45.80]I think there's a save point in here.
[85:55.73]Fools, have you not learned your lesson?
[85:59.25]We are made immortal.
[86:00.95]We shall live forever with Lavos, who feasts upon this planet from within.
[86:06.68]Now he rests and gathers strength, but in a mere 999 years, he will emerge to reign destruction upon the Earth and crown himself king.
[86:16.44]The Black Omen is a path which leads to Lavos.
[86:19.88]It is the conduit through which our limitless power flows.
[86:23.87]As long as the almighty Lavos reigns, you are dreamed of all not.
[86:36.61]Go get him.
[86:37.63]Giga gargantuan.
[86:39.91]Sacrifice yourself to Lavos and fulfill the only purpose left to you.
[86:59.64]Nooo, darkness.
[87:07.22]I'm doing so much damage.
[87:08.36]It actually is crazy.
[87:10.85]Isla, what are you doing?
[87:11.79]Yeah.
[87:41.87]I love for her to not be confused.
[87:45.51]Very nice.
[87:46.61]Nothing stands a chance.
[88:10.86]Cock bomb.
[88:21.89]Lavos is going to be shaking in his boots when he takes a look at us and our team.
[88:43.94]That's a little opener.
[88:45.64]Now we gotta go through the Black Omen.
[88:51.47]What am I doing on heals here?
[88:54.31]You could use... Wait, that wasn't Lavos.
[89:02.42]She did kind of introduce that as if it could have been.
[89:05.24]But no, that was not.
[89:06.72]Show yourself.
[89:19.79]I love that sound.
[89:20.37]Why don't you just go to bed?
[89:33.62]Stay out.
[89:34.02]I can kill you.
[89:37.22]Stop!
[89:40.63]Stay out!
[89:42.19]You little dick!
[89:51.31]Give her that armor back.
[89:52.33]I think she's alright.
[89:54.33]We can skip some of this stuff.
[90:07.51]Uh, lightning would probably be good here.
[90:13.92]This is prehistoric, right?
[90:22.20]Uh, never mind.
[90:35.00]4000 damage.
[90:38.02]Isla has so much strength and she's got such crazy items.
[90:41.62]I'm gonna kill Lavos in three hits.
[91:03.67]Good crit.
[91:09.69]She does 650 damage with a regular swing, not even a crit.
[91:19.53]You ever beat the last stage of the Battlemaster at the end of time?
[91:21.75]Uh, not yet, but I will.
[91:26.13]I'll make sure to do that before I fight Lavos.
[91:27.79]Because I should have an opportunity here.
[91:39.02]He's alright.
[91:39.84]She's ridiculous.
[91:42.71]Ridiculous!
[92:10.18]I'm glad I picked Isla because I've never really seen just how cool that this character can be, but pretty cool.
[92:18.10]She's very, very good.
[92:32.41]Yeah, charm gives a lot of unique stuff too.
[92:38.38]Here's your save point.
[92:47.04]There you go.
[92:48.66]I saved it.
[92:50.85]Everybody can relax.
[93:04.24]I love his magic move.
[93:06.00]Him and frogs are my favorite.
[93:09.84]When they're with frogs.
[93:10.46]I'll show you when frog goes.
[93:30.35]Hey, please tell my son Hunter he needs to take a shower.
[93:39.00]It's been weeks.
[93:40.08]He said he wants to be just like you when he grows up.
[93:41.84]I'm pretty sure you shower.
[93:43.94]Don't take a shower.
[93:45.02]Listen, he needs a shower.
[93:46.28]This is not even a real comment.
[94:10.86]No one said that?
[94:11.66]Just scroll up.
[94:12.46]Somebody just said five seconds ago.
[94:13.92]Uh, I'm gonna save it again.
[94:29.59]They're farming clips of you replying to weird messages.
[94:40.31]Charming this shit.
[94:41.97]We're just playing Chrono Trigger.
[94:43.31]We just hang out.
[94:43.95]We're playing Chrono Trigger.
[94:44.99]Hang out.
[95:03.39]Charm the wall things, you'll get speed capsules.
[95:05.41]Ooh.
[95:07.51]Good to know, actually.
[95:17.25]Crit.
[95:18.11]Ow.
[95:19.68]Okay.
[95:29.43]Okay.
[95:30.13]Well they got away.
[95:58.26]Ow.
[96:06.79]Holy shit, that was a lot.
[96:11.53]How long is this final bit?
[96:13.05]Um, probably like another hour.
[96:14.27]Give or take, depends on how long I take to get there.
[96:28.39]Alright, stop doing that.
[96:39.04]Black Omen's pretty long.
[96:40.62]There are at least two or three major bosses in the Black Omen, so it's probably at least an hour.
[96:44.68]Give or take.
[97:02.45]move this move this okay
[97:34.33]Did he forget he was streaming?
[97:35.45]Um, what?
[97:41.47]Wait, am I?
[97:41.89]I was moving something around.
[97:46.41]Did I just save it?
[97:46.93]I did.
[97:52.22]I want to be Radagon from Elden Ring.
[97:57.24]Like for Halloween or what?
[98:08.88]No, just in general.
[98:16.29]You didn't read the rest of the message?
[98:17.95]What did it say?
[98:18.55]I thought it was just like, hey, I want to be... I thought you were just saying, hey, I want to be Radagon.
[98:35.91]Focus on the game, you jackass!
[98:37.55]Hey, I'm doing- I just saved it!
[98:55.62]They want to be wielded as a sword.
[98:58.77]So not, I want to be Radagon for Halloween.
[99:08.59]You are not fit for the Golden Order.
[99:10.11]What do you guys think I would be in Elden Ring?
[99:14.50]What Elden Ring... What camp would I be in?
[99:18.80]What do you guys think?
[99:29.24]The swamp people?
[99:30.42]Frenzied Flame?
[99:32.98]What I... I don't know.
[99:34.06]Maybe it would be Frenzied Flame.
[99:38.72]I feel like that bar has filled up a few times.
[99:48.74]I gotta get this one potion out of here.
[99:50.15]I hate that it's here.
[99:58.75]Frenzied Flame when technical difficulties happen.
[100:03.63]The bar... You know what?
[100:04.67]That'd be really funny, actually.
[100:07.13]Please remember that.
[100:11.11]I want to remember that for when I'm playing a really difficult game that's really rage-inducing.
[100:16.51]I want a Frenzied Flame bar that fills up.
[100:22.44]And when it fills up, I turn the cam on and I have yellow shit coming out of my eyes.
[100:38.22]Dude, the Frenzied Flame shit... The Frenzied Flame stream was just kind of weird, man.
[100:42.10]Like, I... I thought it was just a joke, but then he turned the cam on.
[100:44.74]And he destroyed his middle monitor!
[100:50.38]He has multiple monitors.
[100:51.34]He just took out his... He took out the middle one.
[100:55.52]And it wasn't a joke.
[100:56.10]It wasn't a fake monitor that was already broken.
[100:58.00]He... He was... It was fucking crazy.
[101:02.86]And he was making these weird Half-Life zombie noises.
[101:07.32]Grrr!
[101:12.79]Don't you kill Isla.
[101:13.77]They just killed Isla.
[101:21.38]They just killed Isla.
[101:24.64]Can we get some Fs in the chat?
[101:27.80]Okay, actually don't fuck around here.
[101:29.44]These things are killing me.
[101:44.79]Take these things seriously.
[101:45.95]What am I doing?
[101:50.61]God, you are so fucking funny, man.
[101:52.97]Jesus, laughing my ass off.
[101:59.74]I can't tell if that's sarcastic or not, but either or, it's funny to me.
[102:05.16]Both ways, that's funny to me.
[102:19.27]I think it's the Jesus on it that is... I can't tell if it's sarcastic or not.
[102:34.20]It does do a lot of damage.
[102:42.66]Chad, it was this person.
[102:46.28]Well, was it sarcastic?
[103:11.10]It was not sarcastic?
[103:14.47]You're sweet, thank you.
[103:15.57]They just keep focusing on Isla, it's not fair.
[103:41.52]How am I doing on health?
[103:42.16]Wait.
[103:45.70]I'm actually going to be kind of sad when there's no more chrono.
[103:51.44]It's been kind of a nice thing just to have for like a few hours each time I stream.
[103:54.64]A couple hours to give or take.
[103:56.96]It's been nice.
[103:57.74]I've been very much enjoying it.
[104:02.05]Hey, but all things have to come to an end at some point, right?
[104:10.63]Did I get everything?
[104:15.08]Are you gonna cry about it?
[104:18.34]Ears are gonna be streaming down my face.
[104:23.17]I forgot it's a ton of gauntlet, but I have some of the best magic in the whole game, so... Let's do this one.
[104:42.65]I was about to be incredibly impressed, but Magus, what the hell was that?
[104:46.78]That was like 50 mana.
[104:47.78]I pressed the wrong button, apparently.
[105:06.09]You're really overpowered?
[105:06.97]I think it's because we did almost every side quest, but...
[105:12.45]I want to see everything again.
[105:17.66]Dark matter.
[105:19.68]That's got to be one of his last moves, right?
[105:33.19]That's the very last one.
[105:58.30]Hey, I need you to name every character in Aladdin.
[106:01.67]Uh, Iago, Jafar, Aladdin, Jasmine, Sultan.
[106:06.85]Um... What's the genie's name, though?
[106:18.27]Is it just the genie?
[106:29.66]I forget the genie.
[106:32.32]That's like the best character in the whole movie.
[106:36.81]Uh oh.
[106:48.70]I want to see the new move.
[106:50.38]Dark matter.
[107:01.15]Oh shit, that's kind of creepy.
[107:04.47]Giant 3D triangle.
[107:14.86]Hey, I just got here.
[107:15.58]What the fuck is wrong with this dude?
[107:20.66]What's wrong with you?
[107:26.10]You good?
[107:31.81]But a lot!
[107:32.55]I have ADHD, I'm neurotic.
[107:39.60]I have attention problems.
[107:44.44]How much time do you have?
[107:45.50]He's a narcissist.
[107:54.33]Now that's what you said.
[107:55.25]He's a Virgo.
[108:01.64]Is that, okay, would you consider somebody, okay, would you consider a Virgo a, like an issue?
[108:08.69]But I'm Virgo Libra.
[108:13.50]I'm Virgo Libra.
[108:14.32]I'm not full Virgo.
[108:23.31]Yeah, see, Virgo-Libra guys, we watch Infinity War and get incredibly emotional during all of the Thanos scenes.
[108:32.39]That's how you can tell when somebody's a Virgo-Libra.
[108:36.25]Like, I cry at the Thanos scenes.
[108:38.62]That's how you can tell.
[108:50.14]You're a Virgo-Libra hybrid mix?
[108:57.41]Was it when he was making soup?
[109:07.28]Are you empath?
[109:09.40]What did you just say?
[109:11.66]Virgo Libra sounds like a mixed drink.
[109:14.28]That was a mod, by the way.
[109:21.50]Just so we're clear.
[109:28.29]Magic Crest, what the heck?
[109:31.69]Ooh.
[109:34.06]I want it.
[109:34.94]Oh my god, an ad's gonna play.
[109:44.36]I didn't even think.
[109:49.58]I'll be right back.
[110:01.46]I was supposed to take a break.
[110:04.16]We were just talking.
[110:04.82]We were having too good of a time.
[110:05.80]We were just talking.
[110:11.72]I'll see you guys in like two, three minutes.
[110:16.82]We were all so distracted.
[110:18.02]We couldn't even get it done.
[110:20.49]That's funny.
[110:22.49]No, we're good.
[110:23.29]I was going to take one anyways.
[110:25.37]See you guys in three and a half minutes.
[110:29.23]The three horsemen are playing without you.
[110:33.56]What are you talking about?
[110:35.21]What are you talking about?
[110:35.97]What do you mean?
[110:43.17]No, I told them I wanted to finish Chrono.
[110:46.67]They're going to be the three horsemen tonight.
[110:53.66]Or they could be the three amigos.
[110:55.48]I don't know.
[111:04.94]They're gonna just have a Jerma soundboard.
[111:14.25]They're falling apart already.
[111:25.11]They're having way more fun than usual without you there.
[111:29.19]Whatever.
[111:31.41]Alright, I'll be right back.
[112:00.15]Thank you.
[113:08.29]Thank you.
[114:05.03]How's it going?
[114:05.57]Welcome back.
[114:06.23]Okay.
[114:06.43]So where am I going from here?
[114:08.67]This way.
[114:37.47]Just one HP.
[114:38.56]I just looked over and saw that.
[114:39.66]Try the trolley popsicle.
[114:51.28]What's a trolley?
[114:52.56]Trolley?
[114:53.43]Is it good?
[115:04.68]Dude is not taking this seriously.
[115:07.38]Not respecting the damage.
[115:17.79]I always use the mids.
[115:18.59]What am I doing?
[115:25.42]Don't be too careless with those mid potions.
[115:32.61]He hates this game, you can tell.
[115:33.79]Yeah, it's a weapon.
[115:37.47]He's trying to hide it.
[115:38.51]Why are these potions so mid?
[115:54.82]Yeah, that puts a little bit on the madness meter, it does.
[116:13.77]Oh, God damn it.
[116:14.31]I was trying to... I want to see if there's a chest over here.
[116:16.15]He hates it.
[116:17.78]I think there's a major boss incoming, so I need to prepare myself.
[116:45.07]They got a video of a colossal squid for the first time.
[116:48.97]Really?
[116:55.91]Seriously?
[117:00.11]Nova armor.
[117:02.05]And a Megalixir.
[117:04.61]Did I already have Nova armor?
[117:05.59]I did.
[117:11.40]I feel like I kind of want this on though for the status.
[117:18.98]I'll keep the white plate on.
[117:22.44]First time in the wild?
[117:25.06]Damn.
[117:30.94]It's just a baby?
[117:40.91]What will you do?
[117:42.15]Shop.
[117:42.41]I have all kinds of great stuff.
[117:44.83]Now here we go.
[117:46.29]Time to spend all of my money.
[118:09.49]There it all goes.
[118:18.19]Alright, I got 33 of these, 12 of these, 14 of these.
[118:21.97]It looks just like a normal squid.
[118:25.83]We're gonna remain.
[118:38.17]We're ready.
[118:39.85]Haste Helm?
[118:40.57]What does the Haste Helm do?
[118:43.93]Which is speed, right?
[118:47.85]Halves time between turns.
[118:50.83]Damn, that's actually... That's pretty great.
[118:57.02]I'm gonna put it on.
[119:01.12]That's pretty amazing.
[119:02.12]Alright, let's go get our ass kicked.
[119:07.73]I'm ready.
[119:09.79]Bring on the finale.
[119:17.58]Or... The finale to the Black Omen.
[119:32.04]Check this out.
[119:34.76]Drop down.
[119:35.26]It's gonna be 4,000.
[119:36.14]Oh!
[119:42.49]4,000 damage.
[119:43.25]4,000 is actually crazy.
[119:46.83]Two of these guys.
[120:13.61]You know what we're going to be doing.
[120:14.59]Hit him with drop down, right?
[120:19.13]Oof.
[120:21.15]Actually, it was very painful.
[120:32.50]Drop down will kill the one on the left.
[120:44.52]I mean, this hurts a lot.
[120:56.00]$9.99 that direct deal from Frog now.
[121:01.18]They're talking mad shit about you?
[121:03.94]No, they wouldn't.
[121:05.12]Those are my friends.
[121:05.70]You're not gonna, you're not gonna Ster anything.
[121:10.04]Those are my friends.
[121:12.45]What do you know about anything?
[121:22.54]roasting you uh being roasted is among friends is a sign of endearment so what do you know I hit the hit the come on open your shield up
[121:57.55]Can I get through it?
[121:58.57]Yep.
[121:58.99]What is that thing?
[122:28.53]Zodiac cape?
[122:31.87]Is that from Magus?
[122:43.50]Oh, okay.
[122:45.84]I mean, the prismatic dress is just better.
[122:57.36]Shit, I got caught on the wall.
[123:03.17]That should kill everybody.
[123:07.23]Anybody else drinking a Virgo Libra tonight?
[123:10.35]Wait, it didn't hurt anybody.
[123:12.75]They're all resistant to it.
[123:25.50]There we go.
[123:53.64]Eyes open.
[123:55.52]Eyes closed.
[123:57.14]Oops.
[123:59.80]Let's do Earthbound after this.
[124:01.36]Earthbound is great.
[124:03.23]I've never really done a full playthrough of Earthbound in my life.
[124:10.33]I've always wanted to.
[124:14.91]Can you mod Chrono Trigger?
[124:16.39]I don't... I don't think so.
[124:18.69]I'm not sure it's possible.
[124:28.60]Be kind of cool, though.
[124:31.22]There's plenty of ROM hacks.
[124:36.48]What would you add to it?
[124:37.22]What would you mod it?
[124:38.14]How would you do it?
[124:48.99]Should've done Frog Squash.
[124:50.68]My mistake.
[125:03.21]There are texture mods for the Steam version.
[125:05.03]Really?
[125:07.31]Interesting.
[125:18.54]Fixes the blurry issue.
[125:19.58]I can kill this little shithead.
[125:28.37]There's also a fan-made story add-on where you play as Magus in his timeline.
[125:48.26]Got a heal.
[125:51.70]I have so many of these, I'll just use them, whatever.
[125:57.86]Hope there's not a save point right here.
[126:18.97]Come on.
[126:20.49]Close it.
[126:27.79]Power crest.
[126:28.57]You're getting so many random items.
[126:34.27]Oh my god.
[126:35.21]That would be max everything for her.
[126:43.51]What's better?
[126:43.91]Power crest or prism spectacles?
[126:51.10]Greatly boost damage.
[126:52.20]I wonder what the difference here is.
[126:54.75]Power crash for her all day.
[126:57.07]Prism specs are plus 50% damage.
[126:59.35]Oh my god.
[127:01.03]Okay, so that stays on.
[127:08.03]I think everyone just keeps the same stuff.
[127:12.75]Yeah.
[127:18.09]I would give that to Chrono, probably.
[127:19.32]If he was here.
[127:27.93]Alright, we're gonna kill this thing instantly.
[127:31.72]Maybe I'll do Earthbite at some point.
[127:34.58]I'm all for it.
[127:36.82]Not immediately, but eventually here.
[127:57.10]Just like Paper Mario.
[128:00.34]I will do Paper Mario.
[128:01.71]I have it.
[128:02.17]I own it.
[128:02.69]It's in the premises.
[128:06.41]It is here.
[128:10.56]It's not a lie.
[128:11.18]That's for real.
[128:13.40]It's on the GameCube.
[128:29.92]Thousand year door?
[128:31.26]Yep, that's the one.
[128:47.15]Oh, I almost missed that.
[128:52.40]Nice.
[128:52.64]Okay, who needs that the most?
[129:00.65]I'm gonna say frog for the heals.
[129:01.63]I think I'm getting close to the end of the section here.
[129:13.59]Oh, same thing.
[129:21.52]Uh, do I give it to frog or do I give it to Isla?
[129:32.22]I'll get her up there.
[129:33.38]Go.
[129:33.58]Any items?
[130:03.84]Oh boy, that's a lot of random shit.
[130:05.56]These things are ugly.
[130:23.61]What?
[130:28.27]What?
[130:28.99]These things are ugly!
[130:36.84]That's rude.
[130:38.58]Okay, well, they're... That is rude.
[130:45.02]That does rule.
[130:51.82]I'd love another level up before I fight the boss here.
[130:55.54]And I got exactly what I asked for.
[131:09.82]A couple of these guys.
[131:10.98]I think I can sneak by.
[131:12.50]I just want items.
[131:21.03]Now the speed capsule, massive.
[131:26.34]Remember when you said it was going to take an hour?
[131:31.00]That is exactly why...
[131:37.26]exactly why I wanted to give this screen the amount of time that I knew I needed which is at least a few hours and that was a couple like an hour or two ago we are very close though we're at least we're probably like 30 to 40 minutes away
[132:09.58]Magus is gonna be slow.
[132:13.42]It's okay.
[132:18.34]And we are there.
[132:23.16]The section before the final section of the game.
[132:25.54]It's been a quite a journey with you.
[132:33.11]We're there.
[132:48.69]Dark matter.
[132:52.09]You know what we're doing, we're doing drop down.
[132:55.09]Killing that thing instantly.
[133:03.57]I think this will kill the top part.
[133:05.15]Maybe enough, maybe two of them.
[133:12.49]Ah, excuse me!
[133:16.29]Magic resistant?
[133:17.63]Or physical resistant?
[133:25.76]Alright, I got... I have Magus.
[133:42.23]Yeah, Magus can just keep doing that.
[133:44.03]Beat him, Aether.
[133:48.13]Can I charm this guy?
[133:56.16]Can.
[133:59.82]Barrier ring.
[134:02.24]That's crazy, right?
[134:16.74]Cry, cry, cry.
[134:36.24]Okay, that's a good 4-0.
[134:49.34]Holy shit.
[134:57.34]Okay.
[134:58.24]Let's do the big heal.
[135:46.05]Very cool.
[135:51.33]Almost done.
[136:01.05]One more section.
[136:04.03]And we are there.
[136:07.23]You're going to cry?
[136:23.21]It's at least an hour before I'm going to cry.
[136:27.96]Maybe a little less.
[136:43.15]You said that an hour ago?
[136:44.82]Yeah.
[136:46.70]Something like that.
[137:02.60]Good.
[137:02.92]Level up.
[137:10.27]I just beat this for the first time on SNES.
[137:13.41]So you're on OG hardware then.
[137:17.13]Good shit, man.
[137:18.66]Good to hear it.
[137:25.64]Fuck, I didn't mean to do that.
[137:43.82]You know what?
[137:44.57]Frog squash him.
[138:16.51]Let's go ahead and do this.
[138:22.09]I got plenty of MP for the next fight.
[138:25.27]Oh shit, where am I?
[138:26.11]I think we're there.
[138:32.27]Yeah, they throw a bunch of shit at you here.
[138:37.96]I guess this is the last possible thing you can do that's the hardest.
[138:42.86]Before probably the DLC stuff.
[138:44.88]Or the port DS stuff.
[138:56.83]This is technically the final dungeon in the game, right?
[139:04.72]DLC was the wrong word, that's right.
[139:12.11]Alright, stop.
[139:42.17]Keep track of how much I've hit the like button and seen the number roll over.
[139:47.35]I've hit like 159 times.
[139:49.25]Oh, thanks, man.
[139:55.34]Alright, hold on.
[140:04.30]This is why I bought all these.
[140:21.95]Two of them?
[140:24.71]Get one right now.
[140:25.47]Ow.
[140:26.29]Shit.
[140:26.57]Uh, just do this one.
[140:54.45]Even that's a lot to 2000.
[140:55.57]Alright, they're throwing the whole kitchen sink at us.
[141:03.38]It's fine.
[141:05.12]Thanks, I'm afraid of something being right here, so I'm not gonna mess around.
[141:19.78]Afraid.
[141:20.36]For good reason.
[141:24.68]Oh, charm these.
[141:27.66]Can I charm each one of them?
[141:28.72]Because that would be huge.
[141:33.46]Speed capsule from each one.
[141:34.54]Okay, that's amazing.
[141:46.65]Isla might actually be the best character.
[142:02.03]Oh my god!
[142:03.11]Alright, settle down!
[142:33.75]They're doing too much.
[142:41.00]Shit.
[142:41.24]Sorry.
[142:41.40]There we go.
[142:53.29]This is the mo- It took me like ten in-game hours to get two or three speed capsule.
[143:07.85]Seems impossible.
[143:11.17]That's not even possible.
[143:15.31]Four.
[143:16.41]Eh?
[143:19.77]She's seducing a wall.
[143:24.60]No, she's charming a wall.
[143:26.88]There it is.
[143:35.34]Alright, now kill everything.
[143:54.18]Well, I can spread these out now.
[143:55.54]Magus really needs them.
[143:59.55]Oh my goodness, that hurt.
[144:03.85]And a free one.
[144:04.85]That's five speed capsules.
[144:06.55]Okay.
[144:09.41]Let's get Magus to 15.
[144:11.95]Max out frog.
[144:12.87]GG.
[144:20.38]Speed is maxed out on all characters that we are using.
[144:25.26]Pretty sweet.
[144:27.26]Okay.
[144:43.52]Good, spawn another one of those things.
[144:44.74]I'm going in there and I'm throwing a fucking javelin into the queen's face.
[145:03.98]What did we get?
[145:06.88]Muscle Ring.
[145:08.60]Cool.
[145:13.71]Lavos, yep.
[145:14.61]Lavos is a little brother.
[145:16.09]Everybody is so fast.
[145:22.27]Oh, that's actually kind of crazy.
[145:29.64]Oh, shit.
[145:30.30]Wait a minute.
[145:32.90]I think the top is resistant to magic and the bottom is physical.
[145:41.88]I believe that is correct.
[145:44.82]I don't.
[146:00.32]Oh, she's confused shit.
[146:04.29]Find out.
[146:04.99]Is it actually the case?
[146:10.05]It is not.
[146:17.22]Well, that's not good.
[146:30.07]No!
[146:43.84]Probably better just to use a potion at this point.
[147:04.60]That'd be crazy if it worked.
[147:14.08]You know what?
[147:15.66]What's going on here?
[147:32.45]I think he's hurting himself when he does that though.
[147:38.61]He's pulling it from himself, right?
[147:52.79]Can I charm the bottom?
[147:55.59]I can.
[147:56.13]I don't even see what I got.
[148:00.26]What was it?
[148:10.57]Power Crest.
[148:11.11]Okay, cool.
[148:30.63]Gotta kill the top first.
[148:32.01]I think I'm pretty close.
[148:33.25]Yeah, there it goes.
[148:37.59]Alright, so how do you hurt this thing?
[148:43.65]Oh.
[148:44.07]Oh, there you go.
[148:51.92]White gemstone?
[148:53.00]I think that's from Magus, right?
[148:59.38]Blue gemstone...
[149:03.18]No?
[149:03.52]What is white gemstone?
[149:05.08]What is that for?
[149:06.06]Is it for chrono?
[149:07.52]It might be for chrono.
[149:12.27]Let's find out.
[149:37.91]It unlocks probably a triple tech, right?
[149:41.17]Enables Puyozo Dance triple tech.
[149:53.92]Cool.
[149:55.64]Whatever that means.
[150:03.22]for the girl team the all-girl one it's a dance party really that's cool alright I think there's one more thing in front of us and then we fight the ultimate not quite the last boss oh dear
[150:34.40]Watch this.
[150:36.42]I'm gonna smoke this thing's face off his head.
[150:48.79]4,200.
[150:49.15]The number just keeps going higher!
[150:50.37]Do it again.
[151:04.88]4300!
[151:13.23]Am I just going too crazy DPS here?
[151:15.07]They're not gonna die, right?
[151:17.23]I think they actually might do it.
[151:19.05]Charm his mouth?
[151:20.23]Oh... He dead.
[151:37.58]Do you miss legendary loot?
[151:40.10]I have Isla.
[151:40.70]I don't need to worry about anything else.
[151:52.77]Uh, I could charm these, but I'm not going to.
[151:55.17]I already got max speed on all three characters.
[152:16.87]Boom.
[152:17.99]Boom.
[152:19.21]Boom.
[152:20.45]Boom!
[152:21.83]Boom!
[152:22.69]That was five big booms.
[152:26.68]It actually was.
[152:38.00]Oh, they didn't even need... okay.
[152:48.15]What the hell is this?
[152:49.70]What's going on here?
[153:12.82]I know what you have seen.
[153:13.98]It is your futures that slumber in this hall.
[153:17.68]Destiny in its essential form.
[153:21.42]All the dreams that might have been, all the happiness and sorrow you might have known, your tomorrow, as it has been witnessed.
[153:30.45]The black omen transcends time and space, drifting through the all and the nothing, waiting for Lavos to awaken.
[153:38.85]Destiny has led you here and you shall remain.
[153:42.02]Unless you can defeat me and bring down the omen, there is no future for you.
[153:45.86]What are you going to say?
[153:56.10]Come, children.
[153:57.90]Lavos slumbers.
[153:59.36]I will guide you into the depths of his dream.
[154:02.47]Did I say dream?
[154:03.93]I meant, of course, his eternal nightmare.
[154:13.84]Oh.
[154:27.69]Oh, hold on a second.
[154:29.89]Hold on a second.
[154:40.92]Get off me.
[154:59.91]GG.
[155:03.28]Uh oh!
[155:04.40]That's not good.
[155:08.14]I already locked in moves.
[155:14.83]She might die here though.
[155:24.72]Oh, that was quick.
[155:26.88]That was a quick move there.
[155:28.00]I don't think I want to do that.
[155:34.87]Let's just heal Ayla.
[155:40.71]Yeah, that's exactly what I thought was going to happen.
[155:45.16]Oh, you're a piece of shit.
[156:06.36]There it is.
[156:06.68]Megalixir.
[156:11.06]My powers don't seem to work here.
[156:13.00]But I have a better idea.
[156:14.90]I can feed you to the Mammon Machine.
[156:17.81]You'll be made one with the Omen, Lavos, and me.
[156:34.24]The Mammon Machine alters all energy.
[156:36.24]Alright, what do we start with here?
[156:40.12]Uh, let's go Barrier.
[156:45.16]On to himself.
[156:50.20]Triple tech.
[156:51.88]Uh, triple kick.
[156:59.02]Attack sacrifice to increase defense.
[157:01.00]Okay, so don't do anything crazy.
[157:07.53]Masamune absorbs the energy!
[157:09.09]Let's do a high Aether.
[157:16.65]Actually, mid Aether is fine.
[157:26.07]Get one of these out.
[157:27.61]And then another Dark Mist.
[157:28.93]I don't want to burn mana too quickly.
[157:42.96]it again.
[157:43.30]Uh, bubble burst.
[157:46.64]Mid-Ether to... Let's do High-Ether.
[157:52.56]Isla needs it.
[157:58.95]Hope that's not a lot.
[158:05.65]Eh, it's okay.
[158:08.61]Or...
[158:22.69]I think he's going to do something huge here.
[158:23.87]I think there's a big move coming up right now.
[158:30.69]Don't remain still.
[158:31.45]Just keep whacking it.
[158:32.89]Good.
[158:51.45]Alright, I need to do Ether after this.
[158:56.34]Massive.
[158:58.22]Do it again.
[159:09.94]Boom.
[159:19.78]We are wiping the floor with every boss, by the way.
[159:24.07]By the way.
[160:06.05]You maggots!
[160:07.99]I am the queen who shall rule for all eternity at Lavos's side.
[160:11.99]You will not stand in my way.
[160:13.77]Fool, no thing, no life can last forever.
[160:19.53]You are deceived.
[160:21.15]A pitiful plight, undeserving of mercy at least.
[160:26.56]I will put an end to all of this.
[160:31.56]A cursed prophet.
[160:33.28]Do not think I have forgotten your transgression at the Ocean Palace.
[160:37.81]You shall pay for it now with your life.
[160:48.67]It's time to fight the Queen.
[160:54.73]Like, why don't we drop down that left hand, huh?
[161:07.51]Ouch.
[161:11.32]53 damage, let's go!
[161:12.30]This is a full heal, because Frog has a ton of magic capsules.
[161:21.88]So we're good.
[161:24.65]What can hurt?
[161:25.85]What can get hurt?
[161:30.43]Right?
[161:30.67]Nope, not the right hand.
[161:32.84]Is it magic damage on the hands?
[161:34.46]And then the face?
[161:35.06]Smash the face?
[161:35.70]Okay, don't hit the hands at all.
[161:44.56]Just going to drain all of my MP.
[161:46.28]Fantastic.
[161:46.96]Wonderful.
[161:50.93]I think I just go for the face.
[161:53.31]Forget about everything else.
[162:00.71]Well, everybody needs to do that now.
[162:01.81]What the hell is that?
[162:09.92]Yeah, we're gonna go ahead and make sure we get some more mana.
[162:20.89]Now I need... Alright, we're gonna go Dark Matter.
[162:23.37]I'm gonna blow a fucking hole through her head.
[162:33.03]Alright, 1800.
[162:34.94]Ah, that's gonna MP bust every time.
[162:37.74]Shit.
[162:38.72]I need more single target stuff.
[162:40.96]Alright, I think we can't do magic either.
[162:43.86]Ow!
[162:53.80]Yo, knock her head off!
[162:55.08]I'm going for it, I'm going for it.
[162:56.44]Is this gonna, is this do damage?
[163:02.04]Yes.
[163:02.36]Okay.
[163:03.26]Isla, you kill and we'll just hang out and heal each other.
[163:18.01]Dark bomb might... Oh boy.
[163:20.11]That's a double dark bomb.
[163:24.09]No, it's alright.
[163:24.67]It's okay.
[163:25.71]Not terrible.
[163:34.13]Just go face.
[163:36.09]Dark Bomb might actually work.
[163:54.02]Oh, hell yeah.
[163:55.38]It does.
[164:02.88]Let's try for the charm again.
[164:05.95]What is it?
[164:10.47]A Mega Elixir.
[164:13.85]Okay.
[164:14.85]That's kind of cool.
[164:19.67]Hands give better items.
[164:20.57]I'll go for it.
[164:42.52]Okay.
[164:47.74]Wow.
[164:49.20]You gotta go through all that bullshit to get a prismatic dress, but you can just charm a hand.
[165:14.86]Oh, that's really bad.
[165:17.10]Please don't do an AoE.
[165:23.28]That's... Thank goodness.
[165:32.83]You piece of shit.
[165:33.55]Why'd you take that?
[165:42.13]It's alright.
[165:46.81]I think I'm going to use... this.
[165:52.34]I have ten of them.
[165:57.28]Worth it.
[166:01.02]We try them with the other hand.
[166:10.14]Prismatic Helm?
[166:13.18]Dude, you can't, you can't even get that unless you do the rainbow stone thing.
[166:18.16]Rainbow Shell.
[166:18.76]Alright, let me go for... Oh, shittiest... Hold on.
[166:30.17]I'm gonna wait for Magus again.
[166:33.97]Because I want Magus to give... Because I want to smash this lady in the fucking head.
[166:46.24]Drop down in the face.
[166:47.50]That's gonna be a 2G.
[166:49.16]4200 damage.
[166:49.34]Do it again.
[166:51.58]Boom.
[166:51.74]Queen is dead.
[167:16.70]How dare you vermin hound my steps!
[167:20.62]Oh, almighty Lavos, lend me your power!
[167:26.13]Oh, shit.
[167:46.58]at last lapo stirs before him you are as grist before the wheel but I I shall attain immortality
[168:17.23]Uh-oh.
[168:29.60]Oh, we are here.
[168:33.38]Lavos enters attack mode.
[168:39.59]We are... not here.
[168:43.29]I'm gonna take the last break of the night.
[168:46.35]Because this is going to be a little while.
[168:48.51]This fight is kind of long.
[168:51.59]And it's going to be really fun.
[168:52.81]This, by the way, the music track that's come... We're going to go on a cliffhanger.
[168:55.83]That's right.
[168:59.27]This fight is long.
[169:00.71]It's got multiple fucking banger-ass music tracks.
[169:03.73]We're going to crank it as high as I can possibly crank it.
[169:06.29]It's going to blow out the speakers.
[169:10.57]We got at least 20-30 minutes left, at least.
[169:17.59]This is the last break of the night.
[169:19.09]And the last break of Chrono Trigger.
[169:20.85]I'm starting to cry.
[169:21.89]Be right back.
[169:49.46]you you
[170:58.09]Thank you.
[171:38.82]you
[172:07.67]I don't know.
[172:13.22]I don't know.
[173:22.62]so
[174:11.49]You guys ready?
[174:14.79]Let's beat Chrono Trigger.
[174:19.21]Not gonna be hard, it's gonna be easy.
[174:20.71]There you go.
[174:28.53]Somebody said, no, I need five minutes!
[174:31.58]I'm still peeing!
[174:34.80]We just- we just had a 3-4 minute break!
[174:36.44]Alright, I'm gonna give you 10 seconds.
[174:43.49]Don't worry, don't worry.
[174:44.27]This is a long fight.
[174:51.15]Let's do it.
[174:51.57]Lavos enters... attack mode.
[175:01.38]Remember this?
[175:15.86]Do it
[175:29.30]Frog.
[175:29.94]Yep.
[175:30.68]Easy.
[175:36.48]Changes attack mode.
[175:51.33]Let's just get... end it quickly.
[175:52.89]Dark matter.
[175:53.59]Dark matter the whole thing.
[175:56.05]I'm gonna give a... high ether to, uh, island ether right now.
[176:00.68]So remember when we saw this, uh, what... was effectively... God, it was, like, seven and eight screams ago?
[176:26.82]You can do this that long ago, which is crazy.
[176:33.47]Just, let's save some MP here.
[176:35.89]No, okay.
[176:36.45]I need, uh, what is it?
[176:37.29]Magic?
[176:38.03]Or lightning?
[176:38.45]Yep.
[177:01.12]Let's do Bubble Burst.
[177:05.35]We're untouchable anyways.
[177:11.27]We are like gods.
[177:28.87]Keep doing it.
[177:30.11]Should I turn the sound down?
[177:35.09]Or are we just going full sound?
[177:36.75]Who cares?
[177:46.68]Fuck it.
[177:47.26]Just full blast it.
[177:51.60]I mean, we're definitely... We'll do this.
[177:59.21]This is loud, it's loud, but it's worth it.
[178:07.82]Adjust it if necessary.
[178:28.05]No, he needs that!
[178:32.01]Alright, we're good.
[178:44.68]Hey, make it louder, I can still hear you.
[178:57.74]I'm gonna save, uh, potions here.
[179:05.03]Everyone's so strong anyways, we'll get it.
[179:09.31]What are you gonna do now?
[179:19.26]What are you gonna do now, Lavos?
[179:25.68]This one is lightning, for sure.
[179:33.93]Maybe fire.
[179:43.23]Yep, there it is.
[179:47.59]About how scared we were earlier.
[179:49.93]About how we didn't think we were going to be able to do it.
[179:54.55]About how we had... we were scared.
[180:01.66]Not anymore!
[180:05.54]Wait, that's me!
[180:20.95]How could I... How could I handle a dark bomb?
[180:29.63]I didn't need to heal.
[180:41.53]Oops!
[180:50.27]Wait, I have to do fire damage now?
[180:52.11]I forget how this works.
[180:54.35]How do you fight Magus?
[180:55.53]You have to do fire now, right?
[181:01.77]Oh, I'm dropping the magic defense.
[181:07.50]Now I have to do fire.
[181:16.58]There we go.
[181:30.31]Not bad.
[181:31.65]600.
[181:34.52]Oh, what's the barrier change now?
[181:35.96]He hasn't done anything yet, so I'm just gonna swing.
[181:45.08]Just keep hitting him.
[181:45.62]The massive moon just keeps bringing his defense down.
[181:47.23]Just keep doing it.
[181:57.41]Damn.
[181:58.63]Damn!
[182:01.50]Tyranosaur.
[182:13.63]Who up fighting the Lavos?
[182:16.51]Ah, lightning.
[182:33.21]Why is it that you're so old?
[182:55.90]21.
[182:55.92]Settle for it.
[183:12.71]Summons 4th Boulder.
[183:14.09]Alright, they don't even hurt.
[183:18.60]Ooh, I forgot the Prismatic Helm.
[183:21.60]Sorry.
[183:32.65]How do I drop the defense here?
[183:42.24]Fire?
[183:47.16]Ice?
[183:53.70]Bro, I think you might win this.
[183:55.78]Um... We are not even remotely close.
[184:01.56]Not even close.
[184:04.02]I mean, yeah, we're about to kill Wulavos right now.
[184:13.78]I'm gonna get the zero.
[184:22.26]I'm good.
[184:30.12]Big crit.
[184:30.58]She does so much damage, that's unbelievable.
[184:59.87]I forget what this thing is.
[185:00.93]I think this is dark magic?
[185:12.58]Prismatic helm, prismatic dress.
[185:16.80]I think the haste helm is just crazy.
[185:24.71]There's no reason to take it off.
[185:30.38]I think they're pretty much best in slot.
[185:32.12]Pretty much.
[185:32.70]I mean, it could be a little better, but... Whatever.
[185:39.21]How's everybody doing?
[185:43.35]Let's, uh... Just get this out of the way.
[185:48.65]I gotta make sure I have enough of these ethers.
[185:59.99]Don't want to run out of them.
[186:01.05]Alright, no more magic bullshit.
[186:03.33]I'm going to save my Aether.
[186:16.08]Finally, Magus crits for the first time in a hundred years.
[186:21.30]There we go.
[186:48.72]Okay, just do regular attacks.
[186:54.02]I don't want to do any magic.
[186:54.90]I need to save my MP.
[187:03.21]Please tell me what Otto do.
[187:05.33]Whatever he wants.
[187:06.61]Let's use a little good boy.
[187:26.73]They're all so fast.
[187:28.13]Convincing repair of parts.
[187:32.22]Yeah, you ain't gonna be able to get that done.
[187:43.41]Uh-oh.
[187:44.03]Somebody's mad.
[187:57.03]destruction rains from the heavens ow keep it up I'll do a heal right now that's not good actually not good actually not good please don't confuse anybody we're good
[188:26.41]I gotta pull some moves out here.
[188:40.46]Alright, now we'll just do regular hits.
[188:54.94]Ouch.
[188:55.38]Nope, we're good.
[189:01.68]Magus is doing work.
[189:04.60]It is done?
[189:14.38]Huh?
[189:16.66]This lava shell.
[189:19.44]Inside still strong.
[189:22.83]These plates are but its armor.
[189:24.27]What we need to destroy lies within.
[189:25.95]This is one dreadful place.
[189:40.90]Even more ghastly than Magus's keep.
[189:44.57]Huh.
[189:45.61]Lavos smell gets strong.
[189:49.05]There is no turning back now.
[189:52.32]That was fucking loud.
[189:54.86]That was loud.
[189:57.88]Alright guys.
[189:58.28]Dreams end.
[190:22.04]It's time to fucking crank it.
[190:23.28]Ow.
[190:42.47]My stomach.
[190:46.17]What the hell is this thing?
[190:58.88]At last, you meet your end, Lavos.
[191:04.52]Cyrus, stand with me in this battle.
[191:08.08]I let no lose.
[191:13.48]Let's go.
[191:21.23]Ow!
[191:36.06]Just an easy 3000 damage, not a big deal.
[191:50.25]Alright, she's got so much physical.
[192:11.26]They all do so much damage.
[192:12.68]We're gonna get through this pretty easily, I think.
[192:14.54]Oh, hold on, hold on a second!
[192:18.44]He missed!
[192:51.20]We have so much protection too.
[192:57.72]What happens if you charm Lavalus?
[192:59.16]I wanna try.
[193:10.53]Stop!
[193:17.13]Not taking any chances.
[193:23.39]Ooh, I got it!
[193:37.28]Enemy has nothing to give but gratitude.
[193:52.99]Save some mana.
[193:57.92]You know what we're going to do now?
[194:06.34]Oh, hold on.
[194:09.72]I need... Who needs it?
[194:10.97]Frog?
[194:11.29]Oh, I... Oh, shit.
[194:12.73]He's confused.
[194:14.37]Okay.
[194:29.93]Let's smoke this motherfucker.
[194:40.04]I don't think I'm poisoned.
[194:58.85]Well, you got a lot of us.
[194:59.63]You got enough.
[195:01.73]That's actually not bad.
[195:02.57]Not good.
[195:04.65]Whoa!
[195:05.75]Hope that don't do a 900 damage, please.
[195:09.82]Oh, shit.
[195:12.40]Oh, hold on.
[195:14.22]That could have been really bad.
[195:17.18]I'm glad I topped everybody off.
[195:27.85]Yeah, Magus has the, uh, I think he absorbs light, right?
[195:40.59]We need to get rid of that status bullshit.
[195:46.44]Who needs MP?
[195:46.98]Everybody does.
[195:48.78]Let's get it ready now.
[195:49.66]Everybody take it.
[195:50.14]Everybody take this.
[195:52.58]I'm, no, don't, don't say GG yet.
[195:55.28]Don't say GG yet.
[195:57.71]We gotta make sure we're ready to go.
[196:27.86]Okay.
[196:29.68]What up, Lavos?
[196:31.32]I just kicked your ass.
[196:39.28]Piece of shit's dead.
[196:45.06]Oh.
[196:51.34]Huh?
[196:53.51]So, since the dawn of time, it has slept underground, guiding the evolution of this planet's life toward its own foul purpose.
[197:04.59]Such a vile being.
[197:06.31]We do not live for your ends.
[197:09.36]Isla no run, hate lose, hate run more.
[197:14.00]We were but sown for him to reap all of humanity, or rather all life on this planet.
[197:22.26]Murderer!
[197:24.78]Will not be used by the likes of you.
[197:26.50]Here's the real banger.
[197:33.55]Is it?
[197:38.43]Oh, that was a fucking tutorial.
[197:42.33]Let's go.
[197:44.11]Yeah.
[197:52.30]Oh shit.
[197:59.32]Where are we going?
[198:09.93]We're going to hell.
[198:48.27]We gotta use it.
[199:00.53]Come on, I need people to get stuff back!
[199:02.29]I gotta do it.
[199:29.33]Alright, get rid of this shit, and then we can go for the body.
[199:31.35]Let's go with the body now.
[199:37.14]How much is the guy gonna do?
[199:42.82]Not bad.
[199:43.22]Alright.
[199:43.92]Let's do a High Aether.
[199:48.21]On... I only need to... Good.
[200:08.00]Yikes.
[200:13.78]Oh!
[200:15.87]No, I'm good, I'm good, we're fine.
[200:40.26]Oh fuck off.
[200:49.71]Random status ailments.
[200:50.73]Everyone alright?
[200:55.01]Everyone's good?
[200:55.72]Everyone's good?
[201:07.53]Alright, defense is now restored.
[201:08.97]We've got to get rid of these.
[201:11.34]Uh, the right core needs to go.
[201:12.44]Let's do, uh... I'm gonna keep the heal ready.
[201:24.06]Fuck!
[201:24.26]I'm gonna kill one left.
[201:36.67]I'm gonna keep Frog the Heal available, I don't wanna do it.
[201:39.09]Uh-oh!
[201:47.61]We good?
[201:47.89]This is the ultimate, this is his ultimate attack, Dream Weaver.
[201:54.85]Okay, that was not even as bad as I thought it was gonna be, but it could've been pretty bad.
[202:03.84]Ah, keep.
[202:05.26]The other one we did was worse!
[202:11.12]If I can get rid of both it'd be great.
[202:21.94]Good.
[202:22.70]Get rid of the other one too.
[202:28.48]Fuck.
[202:28.94]Alright, we have to quit her.
[202:31.17]Alright.
[202:31.81]Defense low.
[202:36.28]Shit, I need drop-down.
[202:39.54]Who needs it?
[202:40.06]Isla.
[202:48.74]That 4K is... That's... Oh!
[202:51.75]He's dead!
[202:55.57]Uh-oh, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[203:05.75]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[203:07.39]What?
[203:07.63]Wait, what?
[203:09.27]These motherfuckers come back?
[203:10.45]I don't remember this.
[203:11.03]I was 10.
[203:11.43]I was 10.
[203:12.55]I was 10.
[203:14.00]What happened?
[203:14.60]I need to kill... I gotta kill them all at the same time.
[203:24.48]Oh, fuck.
[203:24.89]I was 10.
[203:25.11]I was 10.
[203:37.58]Alright, Pod's gotta go down first.
[203:44.97]Die!
[204:03.15]Come on, die!
[204:06.37]Ah, let's do cat attack.
[204:19.86]I need to do a full elixir heal.
[204:22.38]Boom, alright, boom!
[204:26.43]Okay, boom!
[204:31.42]Holy shit, that hurt.
[204:36.92]Okay, we know it.
[204:41.39]Where is it?
[204:42.23]Just do the fucking omega one.
[204:43.81]Do the omega one.
[204:45.09]Everything.
[204:45.39]Just do it.
[204:45.75]Do it.
[204:46.11]Omega.
[204:48.37]Alright.
[204:49.91]Kill that thing over there.
[205:04.39]Oh, wait, he just lowered, he lowered, he lowered!
[205:06.15]What an idiot!
[205:07.02]What an idiot!
[205:10.48]What a fucking idiot!
[205:11.18]Oh, that hurt so bad!
[205:36.67]Lavos core.
[205:37.61]Alright, that thing's dead now.
[205:40.93]It's not.
[205:46.28]Bop.
[205:49.58]Bop.
[205:50.46]That's game over.
[206:28.39]Crono?
[206:31.30]Crono?
[206:33.70]Crono?
[206:39.70]You, wake up!
[206:40.80]And get your wretched body out of bed.
[206:47.59]Your stay of execution has been withdrawn.
[206:50.15]You will accompany us to the castle now, where we will carry out your sentence.
[207:02.95]We've been searching high and low for you, Crono.
[207:06.63]Where did you take my daughter?
[207:10.14]Daddy, no.
[207:10.96]Crono hasn't done a thing.
[207:18.34]My daughter says Crono has done nothing.
[207:21.80]What do you think of that, Chancellor?
[207:25.77]If I may speak freely, Your Grace.
[207:28.82]Your daughter is quite clearly delusional.
[207:31.98]Crono's deeds have impacted the entire kingdom.
[207:35.95]The Chancellor too?
[207:37.03]What's the matter with you?
[207:39.67]Please, just listen to me.
[207:40.81]There's a reason I've been gone.
[207:41.89]You see, we had to... Save the future?
[207:49.92]What?
[207:56.11]You saved the future and taught us what it is to have hope!
[208:04.54]You defeated Magus' troops and restored peace to the realm in the year 600.
[208:09.02]Remember when you did that?
[208:22.93]What's going on?
[208:23.57]Why are you all here?
[208:30.73]Luca, you brought them here, didn't you?
[208:32.43]You're gonna fuck up the whole timeline.
[208:35.93]You undertook quite a daunting mission.
[208:37.83]These past and future members of our line told me all about it.
[208:44.46]Members of... members of our line?
[208:47.16]You mean these people are all my ancestors and descendants?
[208:51.88]Here I was fussing about rules when you were off protecting our kingdom and the life of the entire planet.
[209:02.83]I believe a victory parade is in order.
[209:04.87]Tonight we celebrate you, the hero who saved the world.
[209:10.75]Now, Nadia, why don't you go and enjoy the last night of the fair?
[209:21.00]Hey, let's go.
[209:21.80]It's time.
[209:27.52]Come along with Crono, our hero!
[209:29.90]Come along with Princess Nadia, home safe at last.
[209:32.17]May Guardia prosper for another thousand years.
[209:35.63]Let the Moonlight Parade begin!
[210:13.99]The lava lamp doesn't need to be on.
[210:15.15]It's saving electricity.
[210:27.17]Warm it up or riot?
[210:28.61]It takes like an hour and a half to warm up.
[210:30.80]It's not gonna happen.
[210:44.34]I don't suspect there will be much need for weapons anymore.
[210:47.67]My days as a smith may be at an end.
[210:50.51]But looking up at that beautiful sky, it's hard to be worried about something like that.
[211:00.68]Ah, nothing better than a toast under the stars.
[211:04.12]Rono, have a sip.
[211:05.29]You're the hero today.
[211:12.13]Princess Nadia, you look beautiful.
[211:13.25]No, don't get me wrong, honey.
[211:13.91]You look good too.
[211:15.19]This is fantastic.
[211:41.94]You're neglecting animals?
[211:43.44]Look at the cat!
[211:48.43]Wow, look at all the magic!
[211:50.27]I steal that guy's lunch still?
[212:21.66]Everything is so twinkly.
[212:29.50]Well everyone, this is it.
[212:32.74]The time of parting is upon us at last.
[212:36.98]The gate is growing weak now that Lavos is gone.
[212:41.61]We gotta say our goodbyes before the gate closes for good.
[212:46.31]You're all leaving?
[212:50.54]Kronostrong.
[212:52.06]Maostrong, too.
[212:53.44]I'll have fun.
[212:56.21]You're my distant ancestor, so you better have strong, healthy kids or I'll be in trouble.
[213:02.17]No worry.
[213:02.75]I love much energy.
[213:07.75]Yeah, she does.
[213:12.32]Wait.
[213:13.00]What did you mean by that?
[213:15.68]Kino, dumb.
[213:16.60]I'll go now.
[213:23.01]I've always felt farewells were best kept brief.
[213:52.33]You're right.
[213:52.79]Who needs words?
[213:58.61]Aww, you know it's a happy ending when the princess kisses the frog.
[214:11.73]So, you're going to search for Shala?
[214:14.67]Alright, see you later.
[214:24.26]Luka, I will keep working hard in the future.
[214:30.48]What's wrong, Luka?
[214:31.10]Aren't you going to say goodbye to Robo?
[214:37.12]So, you realized.
[214:40.28]Realized what?
[214:43.21]Robo was born in a bleak future.
[214:45.43]When we defeated Lavos, we changed history.
[214:48.23]The world would never be ruined now.
[214:51.78]Darn it, Robo!
[214:52.24]Don't pretend you don't care when you're really sad!
[214:56.24]It just makes things worse!
[214:57.16]Don't cry, Luca.
[214:57.94]I'm sure Robo will still be built in the new future.
[215:22.70]I'm just leaving.
[215:24.30]I don't know any of these kids.
[215:26.98]And I'm just getting a little awkward for me.
[215:30.58]Goodbye.
[215:34.71]Caution.
[215:35.41]Oil has occluded my vision sensors.
[215:38.07]Sight diminished.
[215:56.56]You remember that talk that we had?
[215:57.64]You mean about whether our lives flash by before we die?
[216:04.54]Yeah.
[216:05.58]I get the feeling that Entity is finally at rest too.
[216:10.16]Yeah, I feel it too.
[216:12.70]What about you, Chrono?
[216:15.02]It's awfully easy to mess things up traveling through time.
[216:17.44]We should probably dismantle the Epoch, shouldn't we?
[216:22.06]We'd never be able to see any of the others again though.
[216:31.66]What are you doing, you two cats?
[216:34.66]You naughty thing, come back here!
[216:37.96]See, Chrono?
[216:38.60]Pets run away when you don't feed them.
[216:43.64]Hey, come back here!
[216:44.58]Oh, shit.
[216:51.86]Oh no, Chrono, that gate will never open again.
[216:57.92]Well, looks like we have no choice but to go after them.
[217:02.22]Go after them, but the gate's already... Luca, you don't mean... We still have a time machine.
[217:14.81]Oh, there you are, Princess.
[217:16.05]His Grace is looking for you.
[217:30.51]I'm happy, you know.
[217:31.95]Now there's no reason for you to be running off anymore.
[217:34.27]I have a gift for you, Nadia, to commemorate this day.
[217:41.86]Rescue the cats!
[217:42.74]This is Nadia's bell.
[217:43.94]It will ring out across the land.
[217:46.20]Pretty, isn't it?
[218:05.94]Nadia, could you and... Where did everyone go?
[218:08.30]Could someone please lend me a hand?
[218:12.18]Thanks for the gift, but... I have places to be.
[218:15.12]Phew!
[218:30.89]Made it just in time!
[218:32.29]Shall I fire a few off?
[218:35.36]There it is.
[218:36.72]That's Chrono Trigger.
[218:48.62]And if you think that Chrono Cross starts with you going to find cats, you are sorely mistaken.
[219:06.74]Probably would have liked the game a little better if that's how it started.
[219:12.60]Where are we going?
[219:22.89]Have you seen the fan-made Chrono Break trailer?
[219:36.16]Yeah, I would love for them to actually... I mean, how would they do another Chrono, though?
[219:43.62]Isn't it one of those situations where the team has been broken up so many times, and there's so many people in so many different companies now, and...
[219:55.84]Chrono Cross is what we got.
[219:58.44]And Radical Dreamers, which... That's alright.
[220:01.44]That's fine.
[220:02.28]I'm okay with that.
[220:04.74]Hahaha.
[220:12.47]I was promised salty, real tears.
[220:18.01]This part gets me every time.
[220:19.48]It really does.
[220:20.06]This part gets me.
[220:21.30]I'm not kidding.
[220:25.32]Robo is with the robo wife.
[220:30.29]Yep.
[220:42.33]Does Frog ever get turned back into a human?
[220:46.58]Um... Play... Play Chrono Trigger and you'll see him as a human.
[221:01.32]He's in a cutscene as a human.
[221:11.75]Thanks for sharing this.
[221:12.35]It was a fun journey.
[221:13.83]Yeah.
[221:16.58]It's been on the bucket list for streaming for a decade now.
[221:22.78]So I'm glad I actually pulled the trigger on it and did it.
[221:24.92]You pulled the Chrono Trigger.
[221:36.76]That's right.
[221:46.76]And Chrono Cross is good, but story-wise, it kind of just takes everything into a crazy world and direction, and it's still the same franchise, it's still a direct sequel to this game, it's still a sequel, but I just can't compare to this one, I don't think.
[222:06.04]This one was just... I hit all the notes, especially when I was younger.
[222:19.64]There are a lot of high points in Chrono Cross.
[222:22.24]But there were a couple of low points in Chrono Cross too that were like meh.
[222:26.61]You want to watch a display of all the triple techs?
[222:40.70]Actually, that's cool.
[222:41.38]Yeah, let's do that.
[222:44.13]The end.
[222:47.45]Anybody got a link?
[223:05.10]I think there's nothing else, right?
[223:07.12]Oh, no, there is.
[223:29.18]There they are.
[223:41.10]Getting married.
[224:13.50]There he is!
[224:15.32]You asked about it!
[224:18.82]Green Vegeta!
[225:18.58]Is there a baby Moses?
[225:55.32]That's the real end.
[226:00.18]I definitely do want to watch the triple tech thing.
[226:06.68]That seems cool.
[226:07.30]There's an ad break coming up in like four minutes, but when we get down to like 30 seconds, I'll just snooze it so we can watch it.
[226:16.12]I'll take about 10 minutes.
[226:24.48]Yeah, I want to see this triple tech video.
[226:28.62]All triple tech.
[226:39.03]You can do the secret boss, the dream devourer.
[226:41.49]Probably not tonight.
[226:44.09]It gives me a reason to say that I might play this game again on stream, which is probably not going to happen, but I get to at least pretend like that's possible.
[226:53.26]I want to eat dinner.
[227:00.27]I love this artwork though.
[227:01.05]Oh, here's a 1080p version.
[227:05.81]Okay, cool.
[227:06.21]Oh, here's the SNES one too.
[227:15.88]Cool.
[227:19.44]I'll grab the SNES one.
[227:32.89]Best song?
[227:33.33]They're all the best song.
[227:34.58]Okay.
[227:55.27]I'm sad now.
[227:57.83]Don't be sad.
[227:58.45]There's plenty more things to do.
[228:00.35]We got lots of other fun things to do.
[228:08.65]Yeah, this is good.
[228:09.95]Good shit.
[228:10.99]Really happy about it.
[228:12.25]Let's watch the triple tech video.
[228:14.53]I'm going to keep the music going.
[228:18.13]It's kind of in the background.
[228:19.50]Let's put it on the video.
[228:29.16]Can you see it?
[228:29.92]Should be able to see it.
[228:33.88]Let's see.
[228:36.51]Triple techs.
[228:42.89]Delta Force?
[228:46.57]Oh my god.
[228:52.01]5,000 damage.
[228:56.19]Is this Chrono Marl- Robo?
[228:58.82]Oh, something's going on.
[228:59.48]Something's happening.
[229:00.02]Something's happening.
[229:01.14]Okay, wait.
[229:01.52]What was that?
[229:03.42]I thought something was happening back here.
[229:08.38]We can drop this for now.
[229:11.01]Oh!
[229:14.26]Super secret.
[229:15.74]Super secret.
[229:17.76]This is all the DS port stuff.
[229:28.79]It's DS port bullshit.
[229:34.89]Ending number one.
[229:35.49]Beyond time.
[229:36.33]Clear count.
[229:36.93]One time.
[229:37.61]Save completion data.
[229:38.43]Yes.
[229:38.53]Yes.
[229:41.38]Yes.
[229:43.94]Very cool.
[229:49.03]Okay.
[229:49.61]Let's watch this video.
[229:52.27]There's also a new game plus, which is interesting.
[229:54.27]Okay.
[230:01.74]Alright.
[230:02.08]Let's put this back up here.
[230:05.02]Get a good look now.
[230:16.36]That's Chrono Amaro.
[230:17.04]Chrono Amaro and Luka, I think I have a few, right?
[230:22.54]Lifeline.
[230:27.37]This is like a super heal?
[230:35.38]What does that do?
[230:37.28]Arc Impulse.
[230:38.26]Chrono Amaro and Frog.
[230:41.24]Alright, that one's awesome.
[230:42.10]6700 damage.
[230:47.28]Final kick.
[230:53.28]8,000 damage?
[230:54.06]Are we gonna see 10k?
[231:05.65]Oh my god.
[231:09.69]Delta storm.
[231:13.95]I remember this one.
[231:14.67]I've done this one a few times before when I was 10.
[231:29.43]Gatling Kick?
[231:36.07]I wonder if anything goes 10k.
[231:37.07]You know how many times I've probably done that one?
[231:44.64]That was like every single move when I had that as the party.
[231:51.58]This one's crazy.
[232:01.70]3D okay here's one of the magus damn ultimate no no omega flare that was almost 10 000.
[232:36.47]Spin Strike?
[232:37.23]Cool.
[232:45.85]Oh, here's the one we just got.
[232:51.63]Alright, it's the Mind Melter.
[232:58.70]Does it confuse?
[233:02.52]The Grand Dream.
[233:12.06]Cool.
[233:16.74]Oh, the Magus one was probably the most destructive.
[233:22.38]And with that... Thanks for watching.
[233:35.71]That is the end of Chrono Trigger.
[233:37.81]Sad to see it go, but you know, it was a great journey.
[233:40.30]It was a lot of fun.
[233:49.05]And I got to figure out whatever I want to do next.
[234:01.90]Finish sorcery.
[234:04.54]That's true.
[234:06.60]Dracula 3 is on tap here.
[234:08.88]But after Dracula.
[234:13.93]Because Dracula is not going to take that long, I don't think.
[234:25.89]Should be fun.
[234:30.49]Don't be sad that Chrono Trigger is over.
[234:32.15]Be glad we got to do it.
[234:38.25]Next time I'll be live will be probably this weekend.
[234:41.49]Probably like Saturday.
[234:45.55]Saturday, Sunday.
[234:49.52]Definitely Saturday.
[235:00.66]I don't think we're going to do a horror night, but we'll do something fun.
[235:11.47]Yeah, definitely Saturday.
[235:12.29]Going to do some more stuff with the horseman.
[235:20.99]Yeah, I missed the horseman stream today.
[235:23.82]We talked earlier, and they were talking about doing stuff, and I said I wanted to finish Chrono Trigger, so I wasn't going to be around today.
[235:32.77]But it seems like they're having a good old time.
[235:43.77]Should I raid them?
[235:44.31]Alright, yeah.
[235:47.66]Who's all three of them live right now?
[235:51.90]Well, how do we choose who we raid?
[235:53.72]Shouldn't you guys- You guys should just split up and just go to three of them.
[236:00.86]You have to choose your favorite.
[236:03.46]Dude, what the fuck?
[236:09.78]I'm not gonna do a vote either.
[236:11.18]I'm not choosing my- No, I'm not choosing my favorite.
[236:16.78]No, I'm not raiding anybody, because you guys are going to take that as like, oh, this is his favorite.
[236:24.42]Here's what I want you to do.
[236:26.24]There are all three of them alive right now.
[236:32.38]Or I could just raid Ster.
[236:35.98]You don't like any of them?
[236:41.41]Alright, I want... We'll raid Ster, and here's what I want you to do.
[236:45.25]I want some of you to go to Ster.
[236:47.17]I want some of you to go to Poke.
[236:48.54]I want some of you to go to Vinny.
[236:50.08]Spread out.
[236:51.16]Behave.
[236:52.52]They're doing something fun.
[236:53.54]They're playing... a game without me!
[237:02.53]Now, go say hi to them, and don't make it weird.
[237:13.52]And tell them I said... Tell... Ster... Ster's gonna be, like, annoyed.
[237:20.50]What if I cancel this raid?
[237:27.25]Should I cancel it?
[237:35.48]Oh, fuck!
[237:36.02]Monster Rancher is not happening tomorrow, by the way.
