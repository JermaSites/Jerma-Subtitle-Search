[ve:60.16.100]

[00:04.20]I'm just testing the audio, see if it's not too loud.
[00:11.51]I think that's a good spot.
[00:16.75]That's good.
[00:25.07]You didn't wash your hands.
[00:28.21]I will be fine.
[00:31.97]Okay.
[00:32.09]Alright, sponsor incoming.
[00:33.86]This is where wins meet.

[00:38.03]Welcome everybody.
[00:38.69]Welcome.
[00:39.10]Welcome.
[00:39.44]Welcome to the sponsor.
[00:42.06]After this, we're going to be doing some more stuff, but we're going to take a quick time here.
[00:47.82]I washed my hands.
[00:50.81]You think I'm not going to wash my hands before a sponsor?
[00:54.39]Are you out of your mind?
[00:59.08]That's a crazy thing to say.
[01:04.38]Alright, let me get in the game.
[01:07.82]This fucking character is OK.
[01:10.90]Hold on a second.
[01:16.37]Hold on a sec.
[01:19.61]Uh huh.
[01:22.46]Oh, hold on.
[01:29.03]Get that where I want it.
[01:33.53]I should be able to hear Ster in a second after I unmute.
[01:45.82]Okay.
[01:48.31]Hello, Ster.
[01:49.02]Hey, man.
[01:53.43]Okay, this is, everything should be set up.
[01:56.46]I think we've got chatbots going too.
[01:59.20]The sun is in my eye right now at this exact moment, and I'm trying to find the right angle to make it so it's not there.
[02:04.77]That twinkle in my eye.
[02:06.98]Oh, he remembers the song.
[02:08.87]You wrote it for me.
[02:10.69]I have that tattooed.
[02:16.11]Does anybody know what we're talking about?
[02:20.13]I do.
[02:21.70]Okay, so we're playing Where Winds Meet.
[02:23.37]Let's see if we can find each other.
[02:24.90]I might have to do a couple things.

[02:43.84]If I can, hold on.
[02:49.03]Hold on.
[02:51.94]I don't know if mine is capturing.
[02:54.93]Yeah, I think you might have to do display capture or window.
[03:00.87]Display capture worked for me.
[03:08.90]Okay, you should see it now.
[03:15.97]I'm gonna get back into the game as Mez Memorize.
[03:21.52]That's my... Dude, I gotta make sure I lock that name down too.
[03:24.67]I love that name.
[03:25.25]It's a great name.
[03:26.46]Mesmerize a little bit.
[03:28.72]No, it's mesmemorize.
[03:33.70]Uh, wait, can you spell that to me?

[04:43.09]They even dug this up.
[04:45.05]The game is free to play.
[04:47.77]By the way.
[04:49.40]And, uh, the devs...
[04:51.13]uh do not want any pay to win mechanics in the I killed on a second
[04:57.20]Okay.
[05:06.99]Okay, I... Let me put on clothes, please.

[05:20.93]That's what Mez memorizes.
[05:22.57]That's my ID.
[05:25.09]Whoa, bro, I don't know if I can sell you cigarettes right now.

[05:54.89]What the fuck?
[05:55.65]What happened to my guy?
[05:56.58]I think you gotta click...
[06:03.25]I didn't even know you could go that far with it.
[06:05.60]I forgot about this.
[06:12.88]Okay, the game is co-op as well.
[06:16.94]Also any paid content they add to this game is only gonna be cosmetics.
[06:20.82]Or a monthly pass or a battle pass.
[06:22.47]Nothing's pay to win.
[06:23.63]It's very important to the devs that they do that.
[06:26.83]Ugh.
[06:27.94]It's available on Steam, it's free to play, it's available, and there's a bunch of fun stuff you can do in it.
[06:33.94]Oh, this is, I fucking, I love it already.
[06:36.28]Okay, can I actually just put something on?
[06:38.79]No.
[06:39.51]Wait, go, uh... Oh, yep, right here.
[06:41.68]I believe... Yeah, you get, like, the one starting outfit.

[06:53.68]Okay.
[06:55.97]This hairstyle is not compatible with this hat?
[07:00.09]It's not?
[07:01.86]Okay, are you referring...

[07:31.18]Okay.
[07:32.73]Since you retreat to Heaven's Pure, yeah, we're gonna do co-op.
[07:35.20]I think we can, there's a, by the way, this looks like there's a bunch of crazy shit you can do in this game, so.
[07:41.88]I'm very excited.
[07:44.43]Okay, one of my disciples, Tin Ying, discovered a strange item and risked his life to deliver a word.
[07:49.99]Alright.
[07:50.76]Upon hearing this, knowing the dream puppet calamity has returned.
[07:54.44]What's going on?
[08:04.78]I love this game already.
[08:05.97]I'm sorry.
[08:06.49]I just do.
[08:14.77]I love this game.
[08:15.90]This game's fucking fantastic.
[08:18.13]I don't care.
[08:18.63]We're on a sponsor?
[08:19.94]It doesn't matter.
[08:20.42]This game's amazing.
[08:22.05]I don't care.
[08:24.51]This is so cool already.
[08:26.00]Alright, I'm gonna be able to hear what's going on.
[08:30.11]Alright, let's go.
[08:33.66]Come on, nothing to see here.
[08:35.54]Let's head home.
[08:36.95]We went through all that trouble to sneak out, and we're going back already?
[08:44.23]Hmm.
[08:44.29]Are you trying to trick me so that you can find that warrior in black on your own?
[08:49.40]There's no man in black.
[08:51.27]I was dreaming just now.
[08:52.83]You know I'd never lie to you.
[08:54.38]You do too, Lai.
[08:56.24]You promised you'd come.
[08:58.78]I guess there's PvP as well, so you and I can fight each other?
[09:01.68]There's like a social aspect to the game too.
[09:04.59]It seems like there's a lot to do.
[09:09.31]Have you hit the playback speed button?
[09:11.06]I do.
[09:11.48]Every time you've heard me laugh has been something else.
[09:14.14]Yes, I did.
[09:18.26]There's going to be quite a few of these before you catch up to me, so you should really like... 1.25?
[09:23.33]I was doing three times.
[09:26.98]Alright.
[09:28.87]actually what is really nice about this is it has the speed up but also there's like uh there's a lot of times where you can just like click story recap
[09:37.54]Yeah, I think there was a couple of spots where it's like, oh, hey, like you missed that.
[09:42.93]Game at your own pace, you know, build it in.
[09:47.42]Watch that bridge!
[09:48.99]That's extraordinarily dangerous.
[09:55.89]It hurts more if you play this at three times because she falls faster.
[10:02.92]I'll find a way.
[10:10.23]Oh, okay.
[10:12.18]Drop.
[10:14.45]What if I just fell straight down?
[10:19.07]Game over.
[10:20.82]Alright, continue.
[10:25.33]Mez Memorize.
[10:26.52]Alright, during movement, press... Oh, you can sprint.
[10:28.06]Good.
[10:33.33]It's pretty buttery.
[10:38.72]Pretty creamy.
[10:39.40]I love your chin.
[10:42.65]Your chin looks like it could wear clothes.
[10:44.60]Hey!
[10:45.02]Whoa!
[10:47.30]Why am I not reacting?
[10:50.07]You are.
[10:50.56]I can hear you.
[10:51.88]No, no, no.
[10:52.32]I'm saying that the character, just like a bird got shot.
[10:55.00]Okay.
[10:55.96]White bird shooting.
[10:57.45]New entry.
[10:57.95]Wait, can you hunt?
[11:04.74]You can pick up pebbles?
[11:07.23]The added bow here doesn't increase draw length by much.
[11:11.04]Arrow accuracy is also yet to be determined.
[11:13.29]I'll have to test them one by one.
[11:15.22]Story review!
[11:20.48]That's all I've been told so far.
[11:23.02]Arrow accuracy is also yet to be determined.
[11:24.67]I'll have to test them one by one.
[11:27.00]I gotta change outfits.
[11:36.70]That is so cool that you actually can speed it up if you want to or get a recap.
[11:47.09]This is the kind of stuff that I think about and I go, you know what?
[11:50.19]I wish I could just listen to this at times three speed.
[11:55.14]Well, the inbound order is indeed well known, but I am merely a humble disciple, far from worthy of being called a hero.
[12:01.08]Sorry to disappoint you, young lady.
[12:02.99]So, you're not a big hero after all.
[12:06.52]Should've known.
[12:09.84]No, you can skip, too.
[12:11.29]I kind of want to get the gist of what's going on, though.
[12:19.29]That open mouth is per I had, it's permanently open.
[12:28.45]Archery tips.
[12:33.45]I'm interested in this being on mobile.
[12:42.98]I'm an iPad gamer at heart.
[12:44.94]I might just get this on iPad and play it.
[12:49.01]Is that a secret book?
[12:53.18]Oh wow, it is a secret book!
[12:55.81]You've gotta take it!
[12:57.05]You spent years on this, and you're simply giving it to us?
[12:59.00]my eyes are going in two different directions too I made them really sparkly though that's the one good thing right go ahead and read it if there's anything you don't understand I'd be happy to explain
[13:08.21]Okay.
[13:08.37]Alright.
[13:10.32]Still waters.
[13:10.79]While holding your breath, reduce the movement speed of surrounding targets by 75%.
[13:15.33]Okay.
[13:15.84]Let's do it.
[13:30.88]Oh, that's it?
[13:32.42]Okay.
[13:32.90]Yeah, let's do it.
[13:36.64]Okay.

[14:18.61]I don't know about that.
[14:22.01]Alright, we can talk again.
[14:34.29]I wish my character was as cool as yours.
[14:36.42]Is yours not cool?
[14:37.62]No.
[14:43.34]I'm very curious about some of the co-op stuff we can do.
[14:51.89]OK, right now, all we can do is be on our guard.
[14:56.03]Alright.
[14:57.13]I think we're ready.

[15:28.46]Holy shit, this is gorgeous.
[15:31.45]It's beautiful!
[15:33.02]Thank you for warning me about Killer Blade.
[15:34.84]You see that mountain?
[15:36.37]You can go there.
[15:37.99]There's no, okay, no fall damage.
[15:39.78]I can pick up twigs.
[15:40.54]I got a twig.
[15:42.09]Are you guys at level one?
[15:46.11]Seems like it's still even odd in Tsumhavu.
[15:49.31]It's like Han is saying everything can wait until it's time for our banquet.
[15:54.79]You can parry, too.
[15:55.63]Parry's in the game, right?
[15:57.86]Yes, sir.
[15:59.95]Again, I don't know all your buttons because you're a controller boy.
[16:05.10]Ooh!
[16:07.30]Execute.
[16:13.06]Alright, cool.
[16:13.82]So that's combat.

[23:45.68]I have to- I gotta get off the horse.
[23:48.35]How do you get off the horse?
[23:52.33]You don't.
[23:55.54]I'm just gonna leave.
[23:56.75]I'm gonna leave.
[23:58.62]How do you gallop?
[24:01.78]Can I crush this guy?
[24:12.02]Just finish them?
[24:12.76]I don't know how to get off the horse.
[24:17.39]Oh, okay, L2-X.
[24:32.73]Eat that.
[24:35.08]Are these guys important NPCs or something?
[24:36.92]Am I doing this so wrong?
[24:42.25]I mean, the world is your oyster.
[24:48.05]It's your journey to forge.
[24:51.56]What?
[24:53.01]I got it.
[24:53.61]I have medicine chest capacity.
[24:57.00]Resting at a boundary stone automatically refills with medicine.
[25:00.01]Cool.
[25:03.71]Alright, I did it.
[25:06.30]OK, you should go to a bounding stone or where the objective marker is.
[25:09.55]I'm going to the objective right now.
[25:11.68]That's epic.
[25:14.43]Nice to see you.
[25:15.58]Hey!
[25:20.15]What are you all doing here?
[25:21.81]Oh, has anyone seen Ruby?
[25:23.44]Sure did.
[25:24.34]She even entered you into a match.
[25:26.03]The arena.
[25:26.81]Young master is the best.
[25:28.36]Are we going to do the arena together?
[25:31.44]It's yours.
[25:32.48]Not exactly Okay
[25:42.47]This is where you kind of practice.
[25:47.52]How much is this game?
[25:48.52]The game's free to play.
[25:51.22]Free to play.
[25:53.15]And I believe it's...
[25:55.08]Hold on, I want to pay attention to this.
[26:00.21]Yeah, free to play, no pay to win mechanics.
[26:09.51]The devs again have made that really clear that they want to make sure that it's no pay to win.
[26:22.79]Alright, co-op quests.
[26:30.06]Unfriendly actions towards passerby will raise their alert level, they may- wait, initiate combat?
[26:37.55]You have to be careful not to bump into people, dude.
[26:39.31]Okay.
[26:40.64]uh win the tournament should I do this first or should I get you into the game
[26:46.87]Uh, you should get me into the game.
[26:47.98]I think that we can do it now.
[26:52.09]Let's see.
[26:52.74]If you press escape, is there a social... No, you need to go to one of the bounding stones outside, which are like waypoints.
[27:00.08]I think once you have the general shrine outside, which is like just down the road on your left, I think.
[27:09.77]Further down the road like down the main road.
[27:14.07]Yeah.
[27:17.96]That looks like it.
[27:21.38]Okay.
[27:23.03]General Shrine.
[27:24.19]New teleport.
[27:27.93]Okay.
[27:29.63]So I got the shrine.
[27:32.41]Now it says win the arena tournament.
[27:37.27]Um?
[27:40.66]You're my friend.
[27:41.53]We need to make a team.
[27:45.12]Let's make a team.
[27:45.78]Alright, so if I go to.
[27:49.63]Or I need to invite you... Guide...
[27:51.76]I'm trying to see if there's like a...
[27:53.01]I know there's a way to do it.
[27:55.40]There sure is.
[27:58.00]By partying together, we get friend intimacy.
[28:01.63]That's exciting.
[28:04.20]Really?
[28:04.33]Request co-op.
[28:06.75]Co-op mode is locked by this player.
[28:10.39]We might have to do the tournament.
[28:13.11]We might have to actually finish this.
[28:15.90]It just says you haven't unlocked it for some reason.
[28:18.37]I didn't do the tournament.
[28:20.12]And you unlocked it?
[28:21.06]I think I...
[28:21.61]I don't know.
[28:26.36]You didn't do this arena thing for...
[28:28.52]I probably have to.
[28:30.87]Alright, exhaust the opponent.
[28:31.62]I just talked to a few people around it.
[28:34.14]So deflect, you lose, okay.
[28:37.23]Alright, let's do it.
[28:38.54]Deflection.
[28:40.62]I had learned about this.
[28:41.75]You cannot deflect gold attacks.
[28:44.12]You can deflect red ones, red ones, or you can dodge.
[28:46.68]Alright, let's go.
[28:50.97]Okay, well...
[28:54.68]I got hit by every move?
[28:56.64]I'm exhausted?
[28:58.49]How do you... Oh, it's R1, not L1.
[29:00.21]Okay.
[29:02.85]I will let that left thing be.
[29:12.48]Did I do it?
[29:16.75]Yep.
[29:16.85]What's happening?
[29:30.71]I hit somebody in the audience?
[29:56.29]Alright, one more.
[30:00.83]I did that, right?
[30:05.13]Yeah, there it is.
[30:07.95]Oh, I missed it.
[30:19.51]Somebody said I hit somebody in the audience.
[30:20.96]That's funny.
[30:27.23]Okay.
[30:40.72]There we go.
[30:42.03]Butcher over blades.
[30:44.26]Check the person kneeling before the shrine.
[30:50.97]Maybe that's it?
[30:51.73]Because it says co-op quests.
[30:56.39]Co-op mode has been unlocked.
[30:58.46]Hey, look at that.
[30:59.41]Okay.
[31:00.72]Okie dokie.
[31:01.72]Switch to co-op mode at any time and invite a few friends.
[31:05.36]Alright.
[31:06.58]You're level three.
[31:08.41]What level are you?
[31:09.88]I'm level one, I didn't do anything.
[31:12.45]Okay, invite...
[31:13.43]I just got to the part where we could play together and then you refused to play with me.
[31:17.22]I just unlocked it.
[31:18.54]It says we're connected.
[31:19.77]You are in my world.

[32:34.07]I think you're in control.
[32:36.22]Okay, so let's get those coins.
[32:40.02]It just says that you're conversing.

[33:23.02]Dude, this is $999 million for everything!
[33:25.67]Is that- Oh, that's part of the- I think that's a joke.
[33:32.80]I don't have 999 million?
[33:40.35]What a snake.
[33:42.00]Which one is he?
[33:48.56]Okay, I can bargain with him?
[33:52.81]Random storybooks and so-called beast eggs that are just chicken eggs.
[33:57.62]What's next?
[33:58.85]Bedtime tales?
[34:01.10]Fifty thousand strings for a place in Kaifeng, and the discount is ten wen!
[34:07.09]Can commoners even dream of buying that?
[34:09.61]And if they could, would Ten Wen matter?
[34:13.13]Oh shit, he wants to go to the arena.
[34:23.32]Huh?
[34:24.51]Tricking children?
[34:26.66]I wouldn't dare, I swear!
[34:29.21]I once dreamed of the jung-hoo too it's a rare joy to meet someone so clever take the set along
[34:36.25]Okay, good, we got it.
[34:44.55]I'll show you how feng shui ended up flat on his head.
[34:46.76]What is going on?
[34:48.02]I'm like not involved with this at all.
[34:49.55]I'm haggling with this guy.
[34:50.49]This guy tried to scam me and I was like, well, no.
[34:55.32]He's gone.
[35:05.73]Okay.
[35:07.02]Cool.
[35:08.05]Earn talent points to unlock powerful skills.
[35:14.38]divine craft fire.
[35:16.38]Sure.
[35:21.35]Consume fire oil to increase HP damage by 1.1% by burn.
[35:24.89]So let's hold up and then up to use.
[35:27.18]Alright.
[35:30.10]Okay, so I have to open the gift, um...
[35:32.80]I think?
[35:33.97]Check on the person kneeling before the shrine.
[35:36.23]We should do that.
[35:38.72]Because that's a co-op mission, apparently.
[35:41.59]Oh, you recommended this.
[35:45.53]I don't know what that is, but it tells me recommend co-op mission.
[35:50.13]Oh, okay.
[35:50.61]Yeah.
[35:51.97]Confirm.
[35:56.81]Alright.
[35:57.55]Check the person collapsed before the shrine.
[36:02.33]Nah, I'll make an offering instead.
[36:03.95]This person collapsed over here.
[36:08.68]What?
[36:09.10]I can kick this person?
[36:18.17]Why can I do that?
[36:23.30]I'm sniffing.
[36:24.43]Why?
[36:26.50]Sniffing them toes.
[36:27.53]What are you doing?
[36:29.16]Get up!
[36:32.82]Okay, curse that Wayfarer, I spent all that money on fake book.
[36:37.61]Investigate the book on the ground.
[36:42.29]Oh, that's what I was trying to find.
[36:43.83]You got it.
[36:44.37]Okay, there it is.
[36:45.26]Oh, you couldn't find the book?
[36:47.14]Yeah, I was looking.
[36:48.40]Okay.
[36:49.59]So where does it take us?
[36:51.49]We gotta go down there.
[36:56.88]Check the suspicious floor.
[36:58.25]Can we PvP?
[37:00.44]I think there was an invite to spar on the co-op I saw.
[37:04.11]I don't know if we can do it now while we're on a mission.
[37:07.36]Where did you go?
[37:08.15]Where'd you run off to, Memet Mesmimerize?
[37:12.20]I'm right here!
[37:13.54]Jump at the center of rubble and press L to cast a mighty drop.
[37:18.70]Oh shit.
[37:22.18]Okay.
[37:25.05]You ready?
[37:25.33]I mean, I'm born ready.
[37:29.87]Get the fire arrow from the chest.
[37:35.62]Did you get the stone?
[37:38.60]No.
[37:40.73]Oh yeah, you never got a choice of a...
[37:44.15]There's a different weapon you can get before this area.
[37:47.12]All these quivers.
[37:54.21]Beauty and the Beast is what people are saying right now.
[38:01.09]Okay, so burn vines on the wall with a fire arrow.
[38:04.55]Because I don't see chins.
[38:07.55]Okay, I need...
[38:08.41]I don't even know.
[38:10.08]Fire arrow.
[38:17.26]Okay, let's keep going.
[38:19.85]Dude, I keep hitting that to look at your profile.
[38:24.75]You got that lamp?
[38:25.87]Nice.
[38:30.19]Combat!
[38:39.35]Oh, fuck.
[38:40.14]Somebody's...
[38:40.89]Okay, I gotta turn that off.
[38:48.98]He had 52 coins on him.
[38:56.83]I love the throw the throw is so good I hope there's more stuff like that I just want to throw people
[39:03.88]Any game where you could, like, kick someone, physics throw them?
[39:08.36]Apparently there's a lot of wacky stuff you can do in the game.
[39:11.09]So, there's a lot of fun stuff to do.
[39:14.41]I think when it starts off with a bear showing you how to do Tai Chi, that's the expectation.
[39:20.32]I'll do triple kill.
[39:23.68]Money bag?
[39:30.20]I got a talent point.
[39:31.24]Successfully assist a member in finding a chest.
[39:33.62]We should try to kill the world boss too.
[39:39.92]Just in case if you need assistance.
[39:43.57]Oh, is this how you summon people?
[39:46.61]Maybe.
[39:47.51]I think there's the co-op preference you choose in the beginning.
[39:50.97]Yeah, I did like shared world just because I figured it was.
[39:53.96]Oh, I did solo.
[39:59.08]So I don't know.
[40:01.27]Anything over there?
[40:04.67]Any secrets in here?
[40:05.95]Any secrets in here?
[40:14.62]You've already, already have an, oh, we already have an explosive barrel.
[40:18.00]Okay, so you have to, wait, what about the X over here?
[40:20.45]We're gaming.
[40:21.01]Here, can you shoot it while it's in my hand?
[40:27.11]But why would I do that?
[40:28.06]You've been so sweet to me so far.
[40:31.88]Do it.
[40:32.46]I can take it.
[40:41.32]Alright, I'll take the ones in the back.
[40:57.08]That guy's dead.
[41:03.90]Easy.
[41:04.93]What about the big...
[41:05.69]There was an X back there.
[41:06.86]Hold on.
[41:07.06]Let me pick this one up.
[41:08.21]Can I pick it up?
[41:11.78]That one's too big.
[41:12.71]You're not that strong yet.
[41:14.43]You're level two.
[41:16.02]Slow down, bro.
[41:28.59]There was a place we could open before.
[41:29.90]There's a lot of people that are dead here.
[41:31.73]This is a boss.
[41:32.79]Are you ready?
[41:33.15]This is going to be boss.
[41:33.94]We have to actually...
[41:35.05]There was a chest.
[41:37.67]Ster, Ster, Ster helped you find a chest.
[41:40.33]Oh, you got it for me.
[41:40.98]Thank you.
[41:44.87]Um, investigate?
[41:46.57]Northern vow.
[41:48.48]Best of luck.
[41:52.94]Cloud steps.
[41:55.32]Okay.
[41:55.82]Practice cloud steps.
[41:58.17]Whoa, wait, what?
[42:02.67]That looks crazy.
[42:03.53]You can jump around.
[42:04.40]Okay.
[42:08.43]Leap high to slam down or hold breath to jump on marked spots.
[42:17.02]Oh, you have to pick between these, I think.
[42:21.18]Hold on, how do I get back to that menu?
[42:28.56]Oh yeah, because if you put that on, then you can't...
[42:30.89]I think it takes the throw off.
[42:32.76]Because we're chumps and we can't have that many skills yet.
[42:34.99]I like the throw.
[42:37.93]You're gonna unlock more mystic slots.
[42:40.21]Cool.
[42:41.58]Alright, you ready to do the boss?
[42:43.63]Yes.
[42:44.21]Because I'm gonna need you to be on your A-game here.
[42:46.69]Okay.
[42:47.87]I'm gonna need you to be on your A game.
[42:50.01]This is a sponsor.
[42:50.65]We have to make sure we do well here.
[42:53.00]Get a game plan!
[42:55.54]Get a game plan!
[42:57.53]Oh, get them next to the barrels!
[42:59.52]Lure them!
[43:01.76]Lured successfully.
[43:09.72]Okay, you dudes are gonna jump on their head.
[43:11.13]Let's go.
[43:18.92]Is that thing going to come alive?
[43:23.11]This looks like it could be a boss room.
[43:25.36]There's a huge chest right here.
[43:31.45]Oh you're fighting.
[43:34.50]Yeah, but I'm fine.
[43:36.92]You just go ahead and get all the loot while I take care of the enemies.
[43:39.82]You get it too.
[43:40.40]It's shared.
[43:47.69]What happened to having like a triple jump in the outside world?
[43:54.57]Nope.
[43:57.36]Oh, here we go.
[44:00.81]Stab him with your chin.
[44:02.34]My character in this cutscene, I don't look like I belong here.
[44:05.68]I look like I just woke up.
[44:08.51]Alright, here we go.
[44:11.06]It's Mezz Memorize and Ster, Ster, Ster versus Zhang Lang.
[44:16.56]Weak undercut units can take extra effects from skills like Cloud Step.
[44:22.27]Next to the barrels.
[44:23.05]You...
[44:23.75]I'm not a boss.
[44:24.66]Wait for me to get out of the way.
[44:25.63]He was... You walked into it.
[44:31.78]Good freeze.
[44:37.41]Alright, we just obliterated this guy.
[44:40.29]The power of co-op.
[44:48.62]The Lord of Jin was a man of justice.
[44:51.82]Tablet here.
[44:52.24]If anyone with a heroic spirit comes afterward, they should bow three times before our Lord.
[44:57.55]Okay.
[44:59.12]We need the emote wheel, right?
[45:02.07]No response?
[45:03.99]Do I really need to kowtow a thousand times?
[45:13.72]Oh.
[45:17.19]How many coins do I have?
[45:17.93]He makes me do all of the bowing while he stands high on up top.
[45:21.09]I was looking at the menu.
[45:26.17]Parting Tears.
[45:27.18]Continue exploring the underground of the General Shrine.
[45:32.48]Okay, I like how your ID picture looks.
[45:34.75]I love these signposts.
[45:36.06]They're so goofy.
[45:37.30]What does it say?
[45:37.66]Look at this one.
[45:38.31]There's a signpost in here.
[45:39.29]Good info on this.
[45:40.41]Hold Ctrl on PC and click the collection with your cursor.
[45:43.95]On PS5, jump on the back then L3 to pick it up.
[45:47.03]Wait, jump on the back?
[45:52.83]What are you talking about?
[45:54.82]I read the signpost.
[45:56.77]Oh no, the one in here.
[45:57.71]There's one in here?
[46:01.15]I don't see a signpost here.
[46:02.44]Oh, maybe we see different ones.
[46:04.27]There's one in here and all it says is hee hee.
[46:08.71]Well, it made us hee hee.
[46:14.94]Up there.
[46:25.30]Ooh, bucks.
[46:29.50]Don't!
[46:31.17]You're gonna do that every time, aren't you?
[46:33.76]Maybe.
[46:36.17]I've got the door.
[46:40.39]So what kind of did you pick a different weapon?
[46:42.24]Do you have a different startup weapon?
[46:44.27]There's a mission near the bear that your chat was talking about where you get to choose a new weapon type.
[46:51.78]But I believe if you just find a weapon, you can equip any of them that you want at any time.
[46:55.77]Okay.
[46:55.89]But I think that's the first time it's like, hey, you need to specialize.
[46:58.72]Pick one to start with.
[47:01.90]I chose the fan.
[47:04.82]It's a little weird.
[47:06.07]Kind of a ranged weapon.
[47:06.99]It, like, shoots darts.
[47:14.47]Okay.
[47:15.30]Trust.
[47:17.68]Five coins.
[47:20.06]I want to know, what do you do?
[47:20.96]I'm trying to see.
[47:21.44]I wonder what you do with the currency.
[47:22.85]I know you buy things, but I wonder where.
[47:24.67]Because I've got five jade coins.
[47:27.40]And then there's also experience too.
[47:29.61]Oh, here we go.
[47:36.24]Can you do an asparagus eating stream before the year ends?
[47:40.32]Dude, it's an asparagus eating stream every day over here.
[47:46.35]What?
[47:48.28]I eat asparagus.
[47:49.41]I like it.
[47:51.14]Every day?
[47:52.26]Not every day, but...
[47:53.67]But your food of the year was salmon.
[47:56.29]Yeah, but that's a side.
[48:02.28]I do like asparagus.
[48:04.21]But it just sounds weird when you say explicitly, I eat it all day.
[48:08.77]Every day.
[48:10.48]uh pay respect can do I think you might have to do this did you do this yet I did pay respects to the general statute is something else we have to do
[48:21.70]I did it.
[48:33.69]Okay.
[48:34.51]Um, maybe I do have to hold it maybe?
[48:44.30]Did you just have to... Oh, you didn't do it.
[48:53.82]I thought I did before we went down.
[48:55.33]There we go.
[48:56.59]My bad.
[49:03.74]Alright, that's complete.
[49:06.97]Now we can set the volume all the way up to two.
[49:10.52]You want to go just kind of explore the world?
[49:13.06]Yeah.
[49:13.40]Co-op Stage Echoes in the Shrine.
[49:14.93]Oh, what'd that say?
[49:15.77]Could be the journal.
[49:16.70]Co-op Zhang... Zhang Ju Legacy.
[49:21.98]Okay.
[49:22.87]So you can kind of just jump to random co-op missions probably, it seems like?
[49:27.06]I think so.
[49:27.87]We should just go explore.
[49:28.85]Yeah, let's definitely explore.
[49:29.50]We should get you a different weapon.
[49:31.15]I want to explore.
[49:31.69]There seems like a lot of interesting stuff in the open world.
[49:38.11]We can get you the weapon or I'll just follow you.
[49:40.85]Um, yeah, where's the weapon?
[49:44.82]Follow me!
[49:47.31]Sit boy.
[49:47.99]I'm sorry.
[49:56.14]Double jump.
[49:56.76]Triple jump.
[49:58.54]Alright, wait, there's a guy here.
[50:00.73]Wait, we can listen to their conversation.
[50:06.13]What are they saying?
[50:07.49]I don't know.
[50:07.84]Are they saying there's wine?
[50:09.71]This might be the chest.
[50:11.80]What a waste.
[50:14.43]Can you hit him?
[50:24.84]I can't hear them talking if you were listening to them.
[50:26.78]Can you attack him?
[50:29.01]Wait, is it?
[50:36.88]I responded, alright.
[50:40.77]Tsk.
[50:47.92]Tsk.
[50:52.84]Leave him alone!
[50:55.77]Were they even bad?
[51:00.35]I mean, the victor decides history.
[51:03.65]Alright, so apparently there's a... Who's this?
[51:06.26]Who is this?
[51:10.18]quest no substance
[51:19.09]What?
[51:21.55]New skill?
[51:29.20]Yeah.
[51:36.88]Every time I look at you, you stop doing what you're doing.
[51:38.93]I don't even know how you're doing that.
[51:44.17]Sorry.
[51:46.04]Okay, practice martial arts.
[51:48.11]Believe it or not, it's up to you.
[51:53.45]Bear.
[51:55.24]Oh Jesus.
[51:57.36]I'm in a cutscene!
[52:01.48]Okay, I'm talking to this.
[52:03.39]I'm talking.
[52:03.97]I want to learn the martial art.
[52:07.62]You're learning.
[52:08.22]I can't move.
[52:11.56]I'll parry it.
[52:12.16]I'm defending you.
[52:17.34]What is he doing?
[52:18.59]He exhausted me.
[52:24.00]This thing's got a shitload of health.
[52:30.11]I gotta parry the bear.
[52:35.76]I don't know if you can pair that.
[52:50.88]If he knows Tai Chi, he should use it.
[52:54.27]Giant bear.
[52:55.03]Now can I learn this move?
[53:02.05]You may have broken the...
[53:06.01]I can't talk to them anymore.
[53:08.68]There weren't even people here for me.
[53:11.89]So I don't know what I did, and I am so sorry.
[53:15.77]Have you been putting on your gear?
[53:17.82]Gear?
[53:18.20]What?
[53:19.31]press b for your inventory or is it tab I'm gonna hear it oh I do have I have the slots
[53:28.56]I don't think I have anything, though.
[53:30.59]In that dungeon, I picked up, like, boots and gloves.
[53:35.55]Is it wardrobe?
[53:36.28]Am I in the wrong thing?
[53:37.89]uh probably the wrong thing different mounts?
[53:47.53]That's cosmetic menu.
[53:48.65]Okay.
[53:49.57]Oh, maybe a bag.
[53:51.04]Oh, cool.
[53:51.44]Alright.
[53:51.84]Yeah.
[53:55.41]Cool horse.
[53:55.67]Where'd you get that horse?
[53:58.01]I called it.
[53:58.65]Max HP.
[54:01.24]From the sky.
[54:03.64]Keep that on.
[54:05.39]Okay.
[54:07.69]Okay.
[54:08.74]Cool.
[54:09.18]I got my gear on.
[54:11.35]Let's keep looking around.
[54:12.38]Come over here.
[54:12.96]This way.
[54:15.96]I can't remember exactly where the quest item was, but it might have been here.
[54:19.72]Because you didn't get the honey, did you?
[54:21.01]I don't think so.
[54:26.37]Yeah, I gotta get the weapon, whatever weapon.
[54:29.04]Uh, come up here.
[54:33.40]You jump up and you grab the honey?
[54:37.46]Whisper Hive, filled with venomous bees.
[54:39.69]These fire arrows.
[54:41.91]Yeah, I have a marker over here.
[54:46.56]Hello.
[54:46.88]Did you get the sky quest?
[54:48.04]Help him out.
[54:50.48]I got it stuck on the rock.
[54:53.33]Qusheng.
[54:58.67]I helped him.
[55:06.89]Okay.
[55:08.40]Fire arrows.
[55:16.39]He speaks madness.
[55:20.55]Come over, and I think you fire arrow the...
[55:25.57]a thingy and then you take it.
[55:31.83]And this might be what gets you the weapon.
[55:34.20]A co-op member collected oddity.
[55:36.70]Okay, I got it.
[55:46.66]Alright, submit oddities.
[55:50.31]The music of Kaiping.
[55:52.46]Submit oddities to activate melodies.
[55:55.84]Ah, okay.
[55:57.95]So you did the fan.
[55:58.79]So it's tank, healer, melee DPS, dual blades.
[56:06.66]Dude, Umbrella seems pretty sick.
[56:10.22]Range DPS Umbrella?
[56:14.16]Melee DPS?
[56:16.80]I'll do dual blades.
[56:24.37]I killed the deer.
[56:28.11]Cool.
[56:29.71]So that's on there now.
[56:36.19]Old Spear Dual Blades.
[56:40.58]That was just blowing up over here.
[56:45.42]Are you attacking something?
[56:48.33]I'm slamming.
[56:52.97]Alright, I got new weapons.
[56:57.62]Let me see.
[56:59.38]Did I unequip it?
[57:01.29]It may be giving you the tutorial to equip it.
[57:03.74]Or you have to scroll down and up.
[57:05.61]You can hold two weapons.
[57:07.34]Oh, I can.
[57:08.04]Alright.
[57:11.60]Oh, there we go, yep.
[57:16.76]Shout out to the one guy who said he would be using dual blades before the stream.
[57:20.85]Hey, shout out to Everstone Studio, by the way, for sponsoring this segment of the stream.
[57:28.03]That's the real shout-out.
[57:30.53]You can get it pretty much everywhere.
[57:31.60]Epic Games Store, Steam, PlayStation Store, mobile.
[57:33.96]Get more details, explanation point, WWM.
[57:38.63]Got a panel down there.
[57:40.34]Game is free to play.
[57:42.78]Where wins meet.
[57:46.80]Looks like there's a scary guy here.
[57:48.61]It looks like a scary guy over here.
[57:52.23]I see a lot of fallen signposts.
[57:53.95]That looks like a scary guy.
[57:57.80]Should we do it?
[57:58.95]Are you going to show me what you got?
[58:00.40]I'll show you what I got.
[58:06.10]What level is this guy?
[58:07.80]He made it in nighttime.
[58:10.32]He's so powerful.
[58:14.78]That isn't going to be hard.
[58:26.17]oh we're going
[58:38.62]oh yeah he deals damage he does like half my health you've got him
[58:46.69]I tried to parry and it was a total disaster.
[58:56.15]Woah!
[58:57.50]You cannot parry gold moves, by the way.
[59:00.83]Gold attacks, yeah.
[59:06.48]Huh?
[59:15.04]What's your other weapon you took?
[59:16.29]You took double blades?
[59:17.27]I took dual blades.
[59:22.70]We're kind of killing them.
[59:23.54]I should have a special ability.
[59:25.03]Mine has the... Oh, God.
[59:27.60]Oh, oh, oh, help.
[59:29.95]Are you down?
[59:30.67]Send help.
[59:32.20]no but morally we have not done very much damage to him I've kind of been goofing off we're good
[59:42.70]I have like a weird dash with all my blades.
[59:46.21]I'm dying.
[59:46.85]Oh, that was a mistake.
[59:55.30]After the last dungeon, I think I was not expecting this.
[59:58.72]Oh, he's goofing around.
[60:00.15]How do I revive you?
[60:02.47]Can I?
[60:04.76]No, let's just spectate.
[60:06.69]I'm just, I'm just watching for my body.
[60:08.48]You got this.
[60:09.44]Oh, he's level five.
[60:10.43]We're level new players.
[60:19.65]I don't even...
[60:20.64]I got only one heal.
[60:26.23]Oh.
[60:28.24]What?
[60:29.34]Wait.
[60:29.56]I think you died.
[60:31.69]Okay, he killed me.
[60:34.92]You ready to walk in here?
[60:36.24]Yeah.
[60:38.19]Okay, lock in.
[60:39.03]We only get one heal each, and we just gotta dodge?
[60:42.26]When I block with the fan, what does this say to you?
[60:47.16]Is this a Power Rangers pose?
[60:49.49]To me that's, I'm ready to rock.
[60:52.06]Alright, here we go, ready?
[60:53.69]Yeah.
[60:57.30]We got it.
[60:57.98]He's level five, but it's fine.
[61:01.01]Hey, we're ready this time.
[61:02.77]Space, skip.
[61:04.80]Whatever your skip button is, I skip.
[61:06.38]Yep.
[61:07.95]Alright, let's go.
[61:13.80]Shit, I did too early.
[61:23.98]Thank you for watching
[61:34.86]You can parry if you're behind him too.
[61:37.16]Seems like.
[61:40.68]Well, I didn't hit any of those.
[61:41.66]That was a mistake.
[61:44.97]Double kick.
[61:54.74]He doesn't know what to do.
[61:55.99]Also, I don't know what those red dots are next to his health bar.
[62:00.54]They have me concerned.
[62:02.47]That's very concerning.
[62:03.68]He might have two phases.
[62:14.64]That's hard to dodge.
[62:15.76]I feel like I am dodging.
[62:17.53]Oh, shit.
[62:18.76]Don't know the timing yet.
[62:20.83]Aren't you a healer?
[62:22.30]Oh yeah, you have a healing potion by the way.
[62:24.62]I've already used it.
[62:32.54]Come on.
[62:40.00]Alright, his armor is almost done.
[62:45.38]Oh!
[62:45.99]Got it.
[62:47.11]Holy shit, that did a lot.
[62:50.67]Alright, he's gonna have two phases, man.
[62:55.65]Eat that, huh?
[62:58.36]That was a perfect parry.
[63:02.09]Uh-oh.
[63:03.54]Oh, God.
[63:11.74]My butt pot.
[63:18.85]It's two?
[63:22.00]Look at this tiny area we have to fight them in.
[63:25.96]I don't know what to do.
[63:29.18]Who do we hit first?
[63:34.10]Also, if you switch to your other weapon, you get your special ability on that one as well.
[63:42.13]I'm dead.
[63:46.10]Current gear durability minus 1%.
[63:49.18]Oh, shit.
[63:53.37]I don't know if I can get you up.
[63:56.20]I think the answer was no.
[63:58.84]Oh, did they see that hit me?
[64:03.06]Nice dude.
[64:07.21]Dude, you can do it.
[64:11.41]Use triangle when that red bar is full.
[64:15.15]Do I have another move that I'm not doing?
[64:19.24]You might.
[64:21.12]Oh my- I don't- I don't know how to dodge that.
[64:23.41]I've tried everything.
[64:24.21]I think you have to dodge through it.
[64:26.18]I feel like I need a- okay.
[64:28.09]I want another healing potion.
[64:30.16]We definitely can get another one.
[64:31.49]He's like three or four levels too high for us.
[64:33.97]We are starting weapons level one weapon.
[64:37.57]We could do it.
[64:38.15]You can go do other things if you want.
[64:40.07]It was a fun fight.
[64:40.96]I liked that.
[64:41.52]That was fun.
[64:43.96]One more time.
[64:45.89]Oh, you can rez with...
[64:48.76]There's another button when you were down.
[64:50.55]Flame Lash.
[64:52.56]I actually do have Flame Lash.
[64:56.92]Last try.
[65:01.34]We have to develop our weapons apparently.
[65:03.27]Cool.
[65:04.87]Alright.
[65:06.67]Try not to make any mistakes.
[65:11.25]I just don't know how to dodge that.
[65:20.52]Thought I dodged it.
[65:25.66]You just gotta be.
[65:26.47]How did you do it?
[65:27.51]You just have to do it.
[65:29.48]You just gotta do it.
[65:31.15]You gotta dodge to the right or left.
[65:32.57]It's a straight move with thrust.
[65:36.14]Oh
[65:48.95]Go to develop talent to unlock.
[65:50.56]Oh, I don't have to unlock that move yet.
[65:55.24]I can't.
[66:07.01]On your skill buttons there should be another button that res'es me now.
[66:10.63]know what it is I don't see it anywhere flame lash defense uh I don't maybe have to go near you
[66:22.92]Oh, it's only for healing weapons.
[66:24.51]Never mind, you can't do it.
[66:27.08]I don't think we're beating them done.
[66:31.53]Oh, I timed it too late.
[66:35.53]Oh my god, that is... You gotta be...
[66:37.00]I gotta wait for that one.
[66:39.88]Again, I didn't wait again.
[66:41.26]What am I doing?
[66:44.17]I didn't wait again!
[66:45.35]He's spamming on you so he's like, learn it.
[66:47.38]Learn it, man.
[66:48.57]Come on.
[66:49.09]Ugh.
[66:55.78]I gotta get parries down too.
[67:05.36]Shit, I could have
[67:17.83]Alright, so it's dunk, dunk, dunk for that.
[67:22.03]Dunk, dunk, dunk.
[67:23.65]Dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk.
[67:27.37]Dunk.
[67:29.46]well oh man we just secret door over here we hit the wall pick up these mushrooms you could probably crap where are the mushrooms with it
[67:38.98]Oh, no, these are signposts.
[67:40.64]Okay, never mind.
[67:42.98]These are swords with hats on them, man.
[67:48.73]I wanna fight that!
[67:49.61]I wanna beat that guy!
[67:50.59]Oh yeah, we have a skill we can learn.
[67:52.92]Wait, investigate this.
[67:54.89]Mechanism here looks connected to something.
[67:56.79]There's a slot right at the center of this circular disk.
[68:02.68]Skill theft?
[68:06.11]Reach level 8.
[68:07.80]I don't know where the level up is.
[68:08.96]Also, you might be a higher level than me and I might not.
[68:10.99]I think I'm level 4.
[68:13.24]What has locked the door?
[68:17.26]Probably have to do this.
[68:20.14]Let me look at the map.
[68:22.18]When you go to where the friend social screen is, there's a develop button, which is your level up.
[68:32.71]Let's see what else is here.
[68:34.74]That's cool though that there's kind of just like world bosses that just hang out.
[68:38.52]There's a lot of skills you can just go learn.
[68:42.39]Develop.
[68:44.60]Level 1 out of 20.
[68:45.90]Okay.
[68:51.93]Upgrade.
[68:54.20]Ah, okay.
[68:56.17]We should have a ton of coins right now.
[68:59.00]Increases damage of all skills.
[69:01.39]Uh, yeah.
[69:03.62]Oh my god, dude.
[69:04.83]We can beat this guy right now.
[69:06.84]Upgrade your weapon.
[69:10.87]There's a lot to understand on these screens.
[69:15.72]Damage of all skills.
[69:16.75]Maybe if I get to level five, it'll unlock something else.
[69:26.15]Okay.
[69:26.97]Damage of all skills.
[69:28.04]This thing should be pretty good now.
[69:31.13]Unlock after talent is activated right here.
[69:35.48]Two talents.
[69:40.33]Mystic skill wild sense.
[69:43.22]Oh yeah, the mystic skill screen.
[69:47.07]Receive approaching entities through wind currents.
[69:49.32]Oh, you can kind of sniff out where people are.
[69:54.03]And then...
[69:56.41]Heavy attacks.
[69:57.39]Oh my God.
[69:57.84]We didn't even have heavy attacks on log dude.
[69:59.49]We can kill this guy right now.
[70:01.50]Where did you unlock heavy attacks?
[70:03.27]I'm not sure.
[70:03.81]I think he just leveled more than me.
[70:05.88]It's in the talent tree if you don't have it yet.
[70:08.43]Where is the talent tree?
[70:10.46]Uh, it's in the abilities, gear, and talents.
[70:14.20]Uh, when you go to your, like, um... Oh, I don't even have a talent tree.
[70:17.27]It just says abilities and gear.
[70:19.90]Uh, yeah.
[70:21.44]Let's kill like a bandit, man.
[70:25.83]Can I get to level two before we fight this guy?
[70:31.94]We can definitely get burst skill.
[70:35.18]Dude, okay, I stab myself and I become like Giga Mode.
[70:41.92]Alright, let's go pick something to do.
[70:43.74]You got your weapon upgraded?
[70:44.52]Do you want to go kill a couple things?
[70:45.53]I mean, if you want to fight him one more time and see how much better you got, then we can move on.
[70:49.34]Let's try it one more time.
[70:50.74]I think we can do it if we are flawless, but I cannot dodge the gold attack.
[70:54.65]Yes, you can.
[70:55.40]I have faith.
[71:02.89]Alright, lock in.
[71:15.46]Alright, I'm gonna go crazy mode.
[71:26.40]I guess I can't Tai Chi throw him because he's big.
[71:33.16]I got two locked in.
[71:35.73]We're doing good.
[71:36.34]If you need healing, I can heal.
[71:39.74]I need to heal.
[71:40.86]I need circle heals.
[71:48.07]I'm just gonna try and stay up, because I think I also can res you if you go down.
[72:00.72]Shit, that was a mistake.
[72:09.84]I didn't dodge that?
[72:25.72]Powerful dodge.
[72:30.31]Did I block it?
[72:32.77]Am I pressing the wrong button to parry again?
[72:34.46]I am.
[72:49.78]Oh that dealt a lot of damage.
[72:54.69]I gotta remember, it's... You just res'd me, dude.
[72:56.80]Yeah.
[72:57.56]Okay, it's R1 to parry.
[72:59.67]R1.
[72:59.77]R1.
[73:01.46]My brain wants it to be L1.
[73:02.49]I can probably change it.
[73:08.21]Huh.
[73:19.12]That heal is amazing, by the way.
[73:20.69]Oh, he's down.
[73:24.20]I think there's a lot to this weapon that I like don't understand yet.
[73:27.85]It's kind of interesting that you can like dash after you fan and stuff.
[73:34.19]Alright.
[73:36.83]Should we just kill these really quick?
[73:40.95]I would like if they were down.
[73:43.64]He's almost in the circle.
[73:55.39]I guess I can't throw these either.
[73:56.53]Alright, that's one down.
[74:06.64]Alright.
[74:10.62]He got me.
[74:12.71]Just play it slow.
[74:13.39]Freaking got me.
[74:18.47]Let's go.
[74:27.65]Oh!
[74:32.09]What the?
[74:33.30]Did you get him?
[74:34.52]Yeah
[74:37.54]Go!
[74:40.03]Huh?
[74:46.35]He's going to you.
[74:48.41]No, he's got him.
[74:48.91]Nope.
[74:49.19]Where's he going?
[74:51.65]Good.
[74:57.96]Damn it.
[74:58.71]I was in an animation.
[75:07.83]I need you to take aggro because I think I can rez you again.
[75:10.20]Oh no.
[75:15.44]Got it.
[75:25.00]Hmph!
[75:28.17]Hyah!
[75:32.84]Oh, you do so much damage.
[75:34.51]Yeah, I think my weapon just doesn't do much damage because it's...
[75:37.75]I should switch.
[75:38.60]I think we can hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[75:41.81]I learned I'm unlocking brain power.
[75:46.09]Oh, I want to fight this guy again.
[75:48.08]Shit.
[75:50.79]People are saying that doing this without all of our skills is crazy.
[75:55.30]It's like fun though.
[75:56.23]I agree that we're missing a lot of stuff.
[76:00.23]How is it free to play and not pay to win?
[76:02.00]Any of the paid things are not for anything gameplay-wise.
[76:07.06]The game seems to go really deep into the true endgame of dress up your character.
[76:13.90]Yeah, it's not like, oh, I'm going to buy like a plus 500 damage.
[76:18.41]No, it's not pay to win.
[76:20.22]They know the endgame is truly fashion.
[76:26.81]And there's a lot of content apparently.
[76:32.01]Pay to look good.
[76:39.89]It feels fun.
[76:41.11]I'm obviously trying to fight the same boss like five times in a row.
[76:45.07]It scratches an itch.
[76:49.51]It looks like you end up getting so many abilities.
[76:52.20]I'm trying to understand this upgrading the martial talents
[77:01.33]But does it itch a scratch?
[77:02.72]That is exactly what it is.
[77:08.04]Dude, and we haven't even scratched the surface.
[77:13.15]There's tons of world things to do.
[77:14.74]There's tons of little quests.
[77:15.82]There's tons of co-op to do.
[77:16.95]Let's do like one quest so I can be level two.
[77:19.95]and have talents at all.
[77:21.69]Let's just find someone to beat up.
[77:24.31]There is a battle pass, but...
[77:27.34]I haven't even looked at it.
[77:28.80]It, um...
[77:32.54]There's a monthly pass and a battle pass.
[77:38.91]But you can play for free.
[77:46.68]I'm curious about the PvP stuff.
[77:48.06]Apparently there's like this PvP mode.
[77:50.82]Alright, open your map.
[77:51.76]Let's get like a little mission here.
[77:53.41]Wait, come to me?
[77:55.04]I think when we were in town, I could press on you and it would be an invite you to spar when we were in that like sparring little town.
[78:03.47]I don't know if there's another way to do it.
[78:04.57]Oh, there's a cat, dude.
[78:05.82]Cat.
[78:06.80]This is a magical cat, dude.
[78:08.15]Look at this magical sword this magical cat is looking at.
[78:14.76]Can we touch it?
[78:17.43]Oh, we have to collect the blue flames of Chayula.
[78:28.24]You're getting all of them.
[78:32.16]A co-op mode member completed the meow meow.
[78:36.31]So we got exploration points.
[78:37.80]Did you do level up for that?
[78:39.68]Level five, it says.
[78:41.05]I didn't even realize I was...
[78:42.52]You can marry other players and then send a bounty hunter to kill them if they cheat on you.
[78:50.08]There was like this whole intimacy screen for us being partied.
[78:53.15]Apparently you can go to jail from what I'm understanding too.
[78:56.50]Like you can go to in-game jail.
[79:00.35]I'm telling you, we haven't even scratched the surface.
[79:02.34]There's a lot of cool interactions in town, yeah.
[79:05.21]I don't know where you went.
[79:06.18]Oh, you're on my mini map.
[79:07.08]I'm just fighting these random things.
[79:10.17]You can commit crimes.
[79:11.47]Should we just try to commit a crime in town or something?
[79:14.34]Yeah.
[79:16.57]I feel like in the last 40 minutes or so that we have here.
[79:18.52]I mean, I guess one time has gone by like an hour and 10 minutes.
[79:26.31]Damn, dude.
[79:28.42]All events to check exploration categories.
[79:32.07]World boss?
[79:32.70]Oh, that is the world boss, the puppeteer.
[79:35.77]Like in this area.
[79:40.40]We gotta kill that puppeteer before the segment's over.
[79:42.37]We have to.
[79:55.28]Somebody just wrote, anyone want to get to the intimacy screen with me?
[80:04.97]There's something over here.
[80:05.69]What is this on the mini map?
[80:14.11]Event.
[80:16.93]Oh, we can cook food.
[80:17.64]I don't know, but I upgraded my weapon five times.
[80:22.17]We need food to cook.
[80:24.63]I think we should go to that town and see how big of goofballs we can be.
[80:29.95]Or these people.
[80:30.85]These people are potentially goofball people?
[80:39.87]Who are you looking for?
[80:41.05]A physician named Jung Choo Choo.
[80:43.85]Seven years ago, she prescribed me a daily tonic
[80:45.92]But it's poison.
[80:46.89]Each dose worsens my condition.
[80:48.31]Now I suffer severe drug toxicity.
[80:50.82]I must confront her.
[80:53.95]Would you find this person?
[80:56.02]How will my young master ever woo Miss Chu like this?
[81:00.77]Do you know what his drug toxicity is?
[81:03.32]I don't know, is it a serious illness?
[81:04.91]It's called lovesickness.
[81:07.44]Seven years ago, his meridians were shattered.
[81:10.39]Miss Chu gave him a... Now his body healed, but his heart remained tethered to her.
[81:15.32]He insists on his...
[81:17.73]Confront her but you're like in my left ear They don't know we're gonna steal their treasure chest
[81:30.68]Alright, we'll go back to town.
[81:31.81]They seem to get increasingly angry with me.
[81:34.39]How did you call your horse?
[81:36.60]Oh, I mean, for me, it was hold six.
[81:38.89]I don't know.
[81:39.86]It says on the right of your screen, does it say the buttons call horse?
[81:42.53]It does.
[81:43.33]OK, that plus square.
[81:47.48]Okay, get on your horse.
[81:52.57]And we're off.
[81:54.27]And we need to go back to the town.
[81:55.94]If you see anything interesting, stop.
[82:08.76]What's this like rundown building over here?
[82:11.52]The destroyed castle.
[82:13.57]I don't know.
[82:19.41]You wanna go take a look?
[82:21.72]There's, uh, there's enemies on the road.
[82:25.22]That'll get me to level two.
[82:29.11]Is it diplomacy?
[82:29.90]Do we have to fight?
[82:30.72]Diplomacy didn't work.
[82:44.45]These guys are way easier.
[82:51.08]Alright, buddy.
[82:59.64]You get a level for that?
[83:04.34]Invited you to a duel?
[83:05.56]Please teach me.
[83:11.17]So can you just kind of hang out in the town?
[83:12.55]I wonder what the actual social kind of multiplayer aspect is like.
[83:20.44]What's up?
[83:28.33]Oh, yeah, magic user.
[83:33.53]How do I get out of this combo?
[83:42.91]I don't know how to do the Tai Chi grab at all.
[83:45.18]It doesn't work anymore.
[83:47.13]Oh yeah, all that health is back.
[83:49.20]What?
[83:56.61]Step!
[83:58.58]How are you still alive?
[83:59.82]Did you just fly?
[84:01.69]Why am I... Did I not even hurt you?
[84:06.31]I healed!
[84:11.16]Dude, level one versus level one fight.
[84:19.93]I guess that's why there's a timer.
[84:31.14]Leave me alone!
[84:32.17]I got- Oh, I got your health down.
[84:46.87]How did I miss that badly?
[84:48.80]That was embarrassing, dude.
[85:05.48]Did I just kill my horse?
[85:11.34]Is that it?
[85:17.92]Do I get healed by the heal?
[85:19.00]No, you're my enemy.
[85:21.78]I'm undefeatable.
[85:26.98]Oh.
[85:31.71]We don't even have all of our moves yet.
[85:34.78]Oh, good excuse.
[85:40.24]Oh, you're getting destroyed, man.
[85:44.74]Apparently, I just unlocked a spear.
[85:52.68]How much damage are you doing?
[85:53.85]Hit me, hit me.
[85:54.93]You're doing 19?
[85:56.31]I'm doing 38.
[85:57.01]I do double your damage.
[85:59.35]I think we're just too low.
[86:00.24]Well, I mean, it's that weapon is a healing weapon basically.
[86:06.30]It's like watching two rats fight over a single piece of dropped cereal.
[86:12.39]Give me that!
[86:17.74]Ah, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[86:21.43]I lost.
[86:25.26]Alright, back to the town.
[86:27.36]Uh, call your horse.
[86:27.88]It's funny that you can't out-damage the heal.
[86:31.38]I think it's because we're level two.
[86:33.40]Yeah, but I'm still laughing Can I laugh?
[86:38.29]Yeah
[86:45.36]Mounted units are highly mobile.
[86:47.04]Use Cloud Step.
[86:49.39]Oh, you can kick them off.
[86:57.71]Heal is OP at low levels.
[86:59.12]I feel like that's usually the case in every game.
[87:04.94]I do like that there's kind of...
[87:07.89]You kinda can just go do whatever.
[87:14.81]The game just kind of was like, hey, you're in the game now.
[87:17.83]Go do whatever you want.
[87:21.32]grandpa Joe what's wrong did you hear from gu quinn no I did it sounds very sad why are you here by yourself
[87:34.15]Don't worry, I'll find it for you.
[87:35.20]Where'd you drop it?
[87:38.78]Okay.
[87:47.31]Doesn't hurt if you're ignoring the main quest.
[87:51.00]You know, I was supposed to...
[87:53.13]I was supposed to open a gift with Ruby like an hour and a half ago.
[87:56.62]That's true.
[88:01.33]Oh, look, a cat.
[88:04.53]Keep going.
[88:05.01]The kitten likes you more.
[88:06.01]Wait, can I have a cat friend?
[88:08.35]Keep going.
[88:09.87]Don't stop.
[88:12.27]I wonder what happens.
[88:13.43]It's like a cat sits on your lap.
[88:14.52]You can't move ever again until it decides to leave.
[88:17.90]What if I have a cat friend?
[88:22.78]A kitten now likes you.
[88:23.84]Are you gonna follow me around?
[88:35.86]Alright, one more.
[88:44.75]We're friends!
[88:48.30]Alright, where's the town?
[88:49.38]Like, the main town.
[88:54.36]I gotta complete this quest, dude.
[88:56.68]Yeah, let me, like, finish this.
[89:01.53]So co-op is unavailable for this.
[89:03.25]I think we have to do this separately.
[89:10.44]So I gotta get back there.
[89:17.86]Hello, horse.
[89:20.35]What's the fastest way to get back there?
[89:21.23]I really do feel like there's so much we haven't done or know how to do yet.
[89:26.30]That's the fun of an open-world game like this, though.
[89:33.97]Upgrade the medicine chest for more heals.
[89:43.29]The horse get hurt.
[89:49.94]Who knows?
[89:51.88]Somebody said plug the sponsor.
[89:55.68]This is where wins meet.
[89:58.19]It's free to play right now.
[89:59.46]Get it on Epic Games Store, Steam, PlayStation, everything mobile.
[90:04.63]Free to play.
[90:07.59]Hey, think you can beat that boss that we just couldn't beat?
[90:10.83]Why don't you show us?
[90:11.70]Let us know in the comments if you finished that boss.
[90:14.63]And if you boot this game up, I come with it.
[90:18.95]I will also be your co-op partner.
[90:21.82]That's not gonna happen.
[90:24.62]Limited time deal.
[90:30.10]uh alright I gotta finish this quest where is she
[90:41.05]There she is.
[90:41.66]I'm so sorry, Ruby.
[90:42.95]I left you sitting here for like an hour.
[90:47.16]There's so much here!
[90:48.23]I can be a hero now!
[90:50.20]Since you paid, I'll share it with you.
[90:54.93]You can have this route sign.
[90:58.46]This one for me.
[91:01.66]There are different difficulties, by the way.
[91:04.94]So, I think you can play this game at, like, super hard mode.
[91:07.55]Like...
[91:08.26]very, very challenging or I think you can do pretty laid back as well.
[91:13.32]I chose normal mode.
[91:14.96]Yeah, it seems like there's quite a few difficulties to choose from.
[91:17.83]Or co-op, whatever you chose.
[91:22.67]I just did recommended.
[91:27.80]I just did the regular recommended.
[91:29.14]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[91:30.31]There's whole, you know, there's like mountains over here.
[91:32.75]What are we doing?
[91:33.72]What are you doing in town?
[91:40.45]Why is your character so ugly?
[91:43.20]Yeah, excuse me.
[91:45.27]Somebody just said it.
[91:46.01]I uploaded a face shot of me.
[91:48.08]Do you think it looks ugly?
[91:49.60]I look like I'm ugly?
[91:51.91]That is a one-to-one what my face looks like in real life.
[91:59.21]New talent point.
[92:02.93]Okay, I got some new clothes.
[92:11.96]Cool.
[92:13.06]Who was talking?
[92:21.29]Oh, it was me.
[92:27.27]Alright.
[92:29.55]I can't look every time, dude.
[92:37.41]Okay.
[92:38.23]Was that your new outfit?
[92:39.23]This is my new outfit.
[92:40.04]What do you think?
[92:41.60]You look pretty stylish.
[92:42.99]I look really stylish, actually.
[92:45.48]You could pull off a handsome Squidward.
[92:47.11]Wait, hold on, let me... We can do a multiplayer, do the horse dance.
[92:56.65]I forgot the button.
[92:59.05]The emote.
[93:08.54]Are you doing it with me?
[93:10.15]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[93:10.64]What about this one?
[93:25.99]Okay.
[93:28.04]Are there like mini games you can do in some towns as well?
[93:31.26]Yeah, I got a...
[93:31.86]I had...
[93:33.42]I got battle pass progress.
[93:39.59]Alright, let me finish this.
[93:40.47]We got to talk to the horse dance with a friend.
[93:46.65]Finish this up.
[93:56.86]I think my game is just saying, like, you completed a quest and I have not talked to a single person or done anything.
[94:01.60]Really?
[94:01.82]Oh, great job.
[94:03.39]I just keep laughing at everybody just talking about the character.
[94:06.36]I look over at the chat and I just see another description that is perfectly
[94:11.42]Would somebody just say it looks like he held a vacuum at the bottom of his chin?
[94:17.53]Did I make that up?
[94:18.23]No, you said somebody sucked a glass?
[94:20.20]I don't know what you said.
[94:21.06]It was something like that.
[94:21.94]I need help.
[94:29.51]What's wrong?
[94:30.91]Something's going on over here.
[94:40.54]Are you fighting something?
[94:43.62]Yeah.
[94:48.12]Something didn't feel right about this guy.
[94:49.53]It said traveling merchant, but he was standing in one place.
[94:52.58]So I started fighting him.
[94:54.91]Okay, I have to leave.
[94:56.14]Just return to Heaven's Pier.
[95:03.63]Are you good?
[95:04.29]I'm killing him.
[95:06.66]He's fucking... You just killed a merchant.
[95:10.35]Yeah.
[95:11.17]That should be good loot.
[95:12.52]A raw ore. Oh my god, he had an oscillating jade.
[95:16.02]Let's kill more people.
[95:19.29]Oh, that's all it takes to bring out the psychopath.
[95:22.62]Oh, oscillating Jade.
[95:23.93]I'm in.
[95:26.36]Who's this guy?
[95:30.06]Oh fuck!
[95:31.54]What?
[95:31.78]What?
[95:33.21]Oh my god!
[95:33.89]I don't wanna do that.
[95:43.83]Everybody has a... Everybody has a...
[95:45.93]This guy's a grave robber.
[95:48.22]You're going to, like, permanently get rid of NPCs.
[95:51.05]He's a grave robber.
[95:51.65]He's a bad dude.
[95:55.82]I can't even fight this guy.
[95:57.12]This is like Yor of game.
[96:04.41]You're on your own, dude.
[96:06.18]It's not letting you join?
[96:07.16]No.
[96:10.76]Alright, I'll do the dirty work.
[96:13.86]No, I can't do anything about it.
[96:15.17]I don't know how Tai Chi is working now.
[96:17.99]It's not letting me throw anyone.
[96:19.17]I thought it was the same thing from before.
[96:27.36]Wait, Spar?
[96:28.31]I'm gonna fight an old guy?
[96:32.58]You just killed him.
[96:35.89]He didn't even drop anything.
[96:37.74]Oh wait, hold on, I have like a...
[96:42.67]I have one disease?
[96:45.24]Why do I have a disease?
[96:46.92]I'm fighting the old guy in the ring.
[96:53.35]Oh, I can watch.
[96:55.12]I don't know.
[96:55.59]At the top of my screen it says you have one disease to heal.
[97:03.17]This guy's kicking the shit out of me.
[97:12.50]Oh my god, dude.
[97:14.25]I gotta... Not this time.
[97:18.31]Oh yeah, I can't join.
[97:19.09]I just have to watch.
[97:20.40]What's he doing?
[97:25.87]Fine, keep doing that.
[97:27.00]I can't shoot him?
[97:28.17]Oh, come on.
[97:31.88]Are you shooting him with an arrow?
[97:34.09]This is actually helpful.
[97:35.73]Keep doing that.
[97:37.48]It's not dealing damage because I'm not in the fight, but he won't stop dodging them.
[97:42.36]Keep shooting him.
[97:43.29]Keep shooting him.
[97:46.22]This dude turned into a pincushion!
[97:53.51]I also keep hearing him going, yeah!
[97:57.34]Oh, you might be freaking him out, man.
[98:01.04]I don't know.
[98:02.90]I'm running out of fire arrows.
[98:03.99]I don't know how to change my arrows.
[98:07.18]God damn, man.
[98:11.60]Dude, I just blocked so many of them in a row and he's still killing me.
[98:23.53]He's tough.
[98:27.77]He's gonna knock me down one more time and it's over.
[98:30.82]How high is his health?
[98:32.85]You just have to parry stun him five times.
[98:37.06]And if he does it to you, oh my god.
[98:39.72]I wasn't paying attention.
[98:41.21]Can you get the heal in the corner?
[98:43.92]Healing doesn't matter.
[98:45.02]He just, he beat me.
[98:46.15]It's like a spar.
[98:46.68]Oh yeah, it's the mark.
[98:47.82]Yeah.
[98:54.95]Did you fail?
[98:55.98]Let me try it again.
[98:56.84]Yeah.
[98:57.81]Ah, okay.
[98:58.17]That's what happened.
[99:00.08]It's just a parry fight.
[99:06.17]Yeah, I don't know.
[99:06.74]I still don't have the talent tree.
[99:10.31]Shit.
[99:14.28]There we go.
[99:17.75]Alright, I gotta dodge this.
[99:26.08]There we go.
[99:30.81]Alright, I got the upper hand now.
[99:48.50]You piece of shit.
[99:55.71]Damn it.
[100:01.12]What is he doing?
[100:07.99]Is it a frog?
[100:08.86]Yeah, he's frogging out.
[100:20.14]Alright, I got him
[100:29.50]I'm exhausted.
[100:35.53]Rog coming in.
[100:37.45]Oh, I got him stuck.
[100:40.93]Can't do that when you're underneath the bridge or whatever it is.
[100:50.01]He's kind of messing up his attack animations.
[100:58.70]Hold on.
[101:02.41]Yeah, it looks like you're getting them because of it.
[101:05.24]I mean, I'm doing a shitload of parries.
[101:09.67]There you go.
[101:10.31]There you go.
[101:13.02]Maybe.
[101:17.06]I kinda wanna shoot him out of the air.
[101:19.03]Whoops.
[101:23.69]I just want you to know there's children out here clapping
[101:31.86]Did I not get this done?
[101:34.53]Oh, I fucked up so bad, dude.
[101:43.74]Whoa, that was different.
[101:55.80]Damn it.
[101:59.78]That's tricky.
[102:00.46]That's tough.
[102:00.98]Try it.
[102:01.26]Try it.
[102:01.44]You try it.
[102:01.74]Try it.
[102:01.93]It's fun.
[102:03.83]You're going to watch?
[102:05.06]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[102:05.48]It's fun.
[102:07.19]Get defeated by Elder Gongsun in a sparring.
[102:10.95]Losing is an achievement.
[102:12.54]I want you to do it.
[102:19.54]fight the child instead?
[102:21.14]You can fight the child?
[102:32.00]Alright, let's see.
[102:34.35]Dude, this guy, get out of the way!
[102:35.47]I'm trying to see!
[102:37.54]Okay, so you get points when you deflect him.
[102:40.55]You get points when you bring, when you exhaust him.
[102:43.44]You have to bring his exhaust meter all the way down.
[102:46.76]And you do that by parrying damage.
[102:48.73]It's a lot of parrying.
[102:58.24]frog mode I'm my character's like stuck blind I don't you you got to learn all the moves man hey weren't you were watching
[103:08.74]Yeah, but I was like shooting with arrows and being weird.
[103:20.26]That's so unfair that you can do that.
[103:28.04]I wonder how many people you can challenge to the arena.
[103:31.20]It's like you get to have your own little NPC mini boss fights.
[103:34.19]This is cool.
[103:38.67]It looks like a ton of townspeople can be challenged.
[103:41.14]Is this in like every town?
[103:52.22]I got yelled at for trying to go in Yeah This guy is very difficult
[104:01.12]You missed like one parry.
[104:03.09]Yeah, it's hard.
[104:06.65]There's no way I should just let him win.
[104:10.99]See that one's tough because sometimes it's gold.
[104:17.55]They have wrestling in Kaifeng.
[104:19.81]That's cool.
[104:22.65]That's rough.
[104:26.80]This is easily the best epic open world action RPG.
[104:29.14]It was also free.
[104:36.10]Alright, let's go do something.
[104:37.97]Is that guy still dead on the ground?
[104:41.32]Is that dead grave robber?
[104:43.17]Do you still kill him?
[104:45.09]Alright, ask BeardGwong about Uncle Jiang.
[104:48.67]Should we do... You want to go try to fight... We need to upgrade our flask.
[104:52.77]That, like, little drink that we have.
[104:55.04]Why do we do that?
[104:58.16]Mmm.
[104:59.47]Gear.
[105:01.61]No, talents maybe?
[105:02.79]I got a new talent point.
[105:05.07]Mystic skill shot.
[105:06.12]I still can't do talent.
[105:07.90]You don't have any talent?
[105:08.97]What level are you?
[105:09.81]What level are you?
[105:10.83]Level four, maybe three.
[105:12.92]When you have that social menu open, I think at the top, it shows your level.
[105:21.65]Level five.
[105:23.31]Oh, well, then why can't I do it?
[105:25.08]Did you do a quest I didn't do?
[105:26.31]I don't think so.
[105:27.70]Unless of your experience from this.
[105:34.96]So I got a new mystic skill.
[105:40.46]Fire?
[105:44.22]Oh, I know my chat says the quests are your quest.
[105:47.44]Maybe that's what it is.
[105:48.96]Maybe you're in my world.
[105:53.99]I don't know.
[105:59.11]Do you want to drop out to your game and complete it?
[106:01.67]So maybe you'll level up.
[106:02.50]What level are you now?
[106:03.83]Just keep going.
[106:05.44]Are you like level 2?
[106:06.40]3?
[106:07.12]I don't want to ruin the vibes.
[106:08.95]It says I was 5, I'm pretty sure.
[106:10.63]Vibes are impeccable right now.
[106:13.57]Yeah, well, I don't want to redo the same things we just did or anything.
[106:16.94]Just keep exploring.
[106:18.55]Chest over here.
[106:26.07]Alright, now I'm level 6.
[106:29.03]Alright, somebody said we can upgrade the heal somehow.
[106:32.73]Where was it?
[106:35.05]We like journal campaign world.
[106:43.44]Where was it?
[106:44.50]Events, maybe?
[106:45.12]Hey, you want to see that character?
[106:56.55]210,000 downloads!
[107:02.81]Level 6, you get an ult?
[107:08.98]I'm getting a, I got an unlockable.
[107:15.49]Can I have that?
[107:18.37]Okay, well this is Battle Pass.
[107:19.95]Don't have to do any of this if you don't want to.
[107:22.50]But, I mean, look at how sick that looks.
[107:40.83]Alright, let's look at the map.
[107:44.57]I see a teleport.
[107:45.65]I see an oddity collection.
[107:49.25]We could do the main story stuff too.
[107:52.42]We could go try to fight that other guy again after you leveled up a few times.
[107:57.78]What do you think?
[108:00.62]We got about 15 to 20 minutes left.
[108:03.65]What can we do in 20 minutes?
[108:06.75]Uh, I don't know.
[108:12.13]Let's just ride, man.
[108:14.46]Yeah, just pick a direction.
[108:15.42]Let's ride.
[108:16.18]Let's just ride.
[108:19.61]Go to the fire icon.
[108:25.11]Oh, you can just teleport to it.
[108:29.62]There's a liar's bar event too.
[108:36.31]I can give him money.
[108:37.12]Here.
[108:37.68]Sure.
[108:39.47]What did that do?
[108:39.97]I think there's a way I can teleport to you, but I don't...
[108:48.04]I don't know where you went.
[108:50.45]I teleported to the... You can teleport to the different things.
[108:54.79]How?
[108:55.57]Uh, go to your map and you can hover over, um, landmark teleport, any landmark.
[109:01.02]Okay.
[109:01.23]I got it.
[109:02.65]The silver fire apparently is interesting.
[109:06.20]Somebody said we should go there.
[109:10.46]Okay.
[109:12.35]So let's track that one.
[109:14.67]So go from, I think from town, it'll be faster.
[109:29.49]Oh shit, I went in the wrong.
[109:31.05]Where did I go?
[109:34.85]I'm following you.
[109:35.45]This took me to the dungeon.
[109:36.56]Yeah, I went to the dungeon.
[109:40.94]Where are you trying to go to?
[109:42.89]Uh, I'm trying to go... What happened to just ride?
[109:46.02]I know, I know, I know.
[109:46.87]I just...
[109:48.01]The map has got a bunch of stuff on it I want to look at.
[109:49.84]Alright, we're just riding.
[109:51.42]Follow me.
[110:00.86]I'm eavesdropping, but we're just going to go.
[110:02.43]Do you have my marker?
[110:03.09]I put a track it.
[110:04.77]I'm tracking it.
[110:05.81]I'm following you.
[110:15.88]Something shiny over there.
[110:16.80]Oh, it's a boundary stone.
[110:28.24]Very nice.
[110:31.64]Hey.
[110:33.37]This is a lot of people.
[110:36.68]Are you socially anxious?
[110:38.12]There's a lot of people here.
[110:42.04]What should we do?
[110:42.64]Those are stone.
[110:45.12]It was a Medusa, man.
[110:46.77]These are not...
[110:47.71]Okay.
[110:48.26]Well, they...
[110:49.06]I thought it was a crowd of...
[110:50.23]I need my glasses on.
[111:01.88]Alright, keep following me.
[111:02.95]It's very interesting.
[111:04.05]We could stop.
[111:06.87]There's apparently a treasure chest.
[111:08.32]There's a chest?
[111:08.80]There's a chest?
[111:09.22]There's a chest?
[111:09.84]There's a chest?
[111:10.18]There's a chest?
[111:10.53]There's a chest?
[111:10.93]There's a chest?
[111:11.29]There's a chest?
[111:11.67]Alright, let's do it.
[111:12.11]Let's do it.
[111:12.41]Let's co-op restrict it.
[111:13.30]I'm coming.
[111:16.61]That is a little ass chest.
[111:22.12]There's a lot of stuff in that little chest.
[111:23.85]Level two iron.
[111:26.56]Some of these NPCs that are stoned are named.
[111:28.90]I think we need to save their lives.
[111:33.06]You think so?
[111:36.66]Let's keep going.
[111:45.13]Oh, there's another cat up here.
[111:46.40]Another cat?
[111:54.76]It's a little ass chest for a big ass streamer.
[111:57.53]I'm doing a little puzzle.
[111:59.74]Puzzle appointment failure.
[112:01.43]You failed it.
[112:01.99]Where are you?
[112:07.39]You can see me on the map.
[112:10.32]NPC over here.
[112:21.22]You did a meow-meow.
[112:21.93]I completed the meow-meow.
[112:23.37]With a soft lick.
[112:24.14]Meow-meow.
[112:24.86]What did you get?
[112:25.55]I wanted to do that.
[112:27.48]I got five bells for little cat bells.
[112:30.84]Are they just hidden cats everywhere?
[112:35.41]It was a totally different little puzzle than the one we did before.
[112:41.22]Alright, don't kill this NPC please.
[112:46.48]Marshall Fellowship level 16.
[112:52.83]I think I have to be level 16 for this?
[112:56.44]I can't do this, you're level 16!
[113:00.88]Alright, we're gonna come back later.
[113:05.27]We're getting you get like experience for exploring, too, which is nice.
[113:08.58]Yeah, I got a beehive on the top of the thing up here.
[113:14.31]I thought this was you.
[113:15.44]This is just...
[113:17.13]I think I heard this person.
[113:18.50]This person's... What's going on?
[113:23.66]This person has like a pissed off meter.
[113:36.99]Should I not do that?
[113:42.85]I hear another cat.
[113:45.02]Okay.
[113:45.56]Ends of the Earth.
[113:49.14]Executing.
[113:53.70]It's very pretty.

[113:59.08]It runs really well too.
[114:04.01]Oh, I got a map.
[114:07.22]That's a lot of stuff.
[114:16.60]Combat outpost.
[114:17.62]Alright.
[114:20.88]Let's go to the combat outpost.
[114:24.21]We're probably going to be underleveled for all this.
[114:33.20]It's kind of crazy how like in co-op you could just like share the loot like what I'm just running around opening chests you haven't even seen.
[114:42.52]Yeah.
[114:44.58]Um, there is, there's a bunch of stuff here.
[114:48.75]What's this?
[114:49.66]Peddler at Heaven's Pier.
[114:52.26]There's a bounty.
[114:53.87]That's the thing I just tried to do.
[114:55.40]There's also a crafting zone.
[114:59.51]Dude, I'm not even messing around with you.
[115:04.47]I'm going to play this on my iPad literally every day.
[115:08.02]I'll play with you.
[115:10.90]I think you actually, I think you actually can too.
[115:19.39]Your new toilet game.
[115:21.65]This seems like I'm gonna just like kind of it's gonna be good.
[115:28.11]Alright, let's keep going.
[115:29.02]We got about like five minutes or so.
[115:31.19]I'm just in this town.
[115:32.47]There's a pretty big town here.
[115:34.42]I'm kind of just looking around.
[115:35.87]There's a lot of things to look at.
[115:42.52]You still drink espressos in the bathroom?
[115:49.39]Is my horse okay?
[115:52.26]Uh oh.
[115:54.91]What's this guy's problem?
[115:58.17]You know we have to beat the puppeteer, man.
[115:59.84]We need to be grinding, man.
[116:01.30]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[116:04.74]Can I talk to this guy?
[116:11.99]I'm like leveling up by just like picking things up everywhere.
[116:16.57]You are getting me.
[116:17.66]Yeah, you're getting me so much currency.
[116:20.13]I just hear like, ding, ding, ding.
[116:23.30]You are doing so much.
[116:24.54]I'm very appreciative.
[116:25.97]This is the farm strat.
[116:28.05]You go around and do whatever quest you want, and I'm on, like, I'm on item pickup duty.
[116:33.48]Alright, let's go kill that guy.
[116:34.88]Let's go get him.
[116:35.87]We can do it.
[116:36.91]We can do it.
[116:37.31]You got a good heal.
[116:38.10]Let's level up our shit.
[116:39.38]We got to kill that puppet guy right now.
[116:42.97]I'm leveling up.
[116:44.54]Did you get all the items that I got?
[116:47.73]I did.
[116:48.01]Were you getting items as well?
[116:48.90]I'm getting pretty much everything.
[116:50.20]Check your inventory too.
[116:51.55]I got a...
[116:54.85]an amulet that I put on.
[116:56.42]I've got like stuff for the other slots now.
[117:08.10]They have way better stuff.
[117:10.95]Yeah, armor too is important.
[117:12.63]Look at this town.
[117:13.38]There's so much shit.
[117:14.66]There's so many things to do.
[117:18.22]You can eat food.
[117:19.19]And I think you can attack everybody here.
[117:21.83]And there's a jail.
[117:22.62]Do you want to try to go to jail to see what happens?
[117:24.58]I'm curious.
[117:25.77]I'm going to go to jail.
[117:28.97]Oh, he goes to jail to avoid the puppeteer.
[117:35.25]You can attack everybody.
[117:36.25]I mean, I beat up two people in town.
[117:38.49]No one seemed to mind.
[117:45.90]Am I good?
[117:53.64]Yeah, they don't really...
[117:54.67]I think you have to do something bad.
[117:56.01]You have to keep doing that.
[117:59.43]Keep doing that.

[135:55.79]We are damaged.
[136:01.49]I am taking a lot of damage as well.
[136:08.71]My healing is I have a lot of healing now because I've upgraded so many times.
[136:17.29]Dude, parries are coming out pretty strong.
[136:19.35]Also, when he goes in the air and does that, I have a feeling you can just like triple jump and dodge it because he hits the ground.
[136:28.79]instead of like, trying to evade.
[136:31.92]Alright, get him out of that.
[136:39.36]Alright, phase one almost done.
[136:41.44]You got one of those heals?
[136:44.17]Uh, eight seconds.
[136:45.08]I've been keep putting them down.
[136:48.37]Oh, that was a bad time for him to do that.
[136:56.90]Alright, phase two.
[136:59.91]You know?
[137:09.43]I gotta heal.
[137:17.11]I'm sad that I already used my heal.
[137:29.04]We can kind of stall in here and I can could also just have healed you a bunch.
[137:34.08]Mine is dead.
[137:34.66]He's coming in.
[137:49.12]I thought I blocked it.
[137:53.54]I took so much damage there, dude.
[137:55.01]It was so bad.
[138:04.34]healing circle behind you.
[138:15.90]I could have played that first part so much better thank you I died for it I had to stand still to do it
[138:27.80]Oh, he got me with the fucking double spin.
[138:30.32]Alright, we got it, we got it, we got it, we got it, we got it.
[138:40.12]I'm curious if he has one more phase after that.
[138:42.67]I feel like that's probably it.
[138:43.89]He has the two bars.
[138:45.30]The two...
[139:06.91]Dammit!
[139:27.16]No!

[140:08.67]That was weird.
[140:10.84]Okay, what's your health at?
[140:12.32]I'm at full health, but I used a thing already.
[140:15.83]I know dude, I'm just spamming.
[140:21.29]I gotta be better at not spamming.
[140:23.83]I've been doing a lot of blocking.
[140:27.29]Okay, let's do this.
[140:33.94]See?
[140:36.83]Where it ain't.
[140:42.05]He's kind of aggroed, but not really.
[140:43.94]I don't think he can enter the circle, Warren.
[140:50.56]OK, one down, he's down.
[140:53.98]Alright, where's he going?
[141:08.45]Damn it!

[143:26.70]Like a drink.
[143:29.70]We had it too.
[143:32.15]I need more than one heel.
[143:36.19]My chat keeps saying I have another heal, but, like, I can spam heavy on mine, but I don't...
[143:41.29]I don't know if I unlocked shit yet, and I still don't get how to unlock.
[143:44.82]Spear might be better.
[143:48.46]Oh, man.
[143:49.24]We had it, too.
[143:51.80]Spirit Bumpy do more damage.
[143:53.05]Yeah.
[143:53.33]Hold on.
[143:56.30]Yeah, I have not unlocked heavy attack.
[143:58.47]Did you?
[143:58.81]I do.
[144:01.36]I don't know how you got this stuff and I didn't.
[144:05.31]Let me see.
[144:06.02]It might be because it's like your world and you actually did the main quest.
[144:10.45]So I think I need to unlock more shit with this, but...
[144:17.04]What does the actual move do?
[144:18.51]I don't know what that is, but that seems kind of fucking cool.
[144:23.28]What does it do?
[144:26.63]No, I probably should stay on the other one.
[144:32.99]I know that of the move set by this point, and I upgraded it already.
[144:37.93]I'll keep it up for now.
[144:40.48]Alright, you want to try again, or do you want to... We have to kill this guy, you know what I'm saying?
[144:44.48]We can try again.
[144:45.20]We were really close.
[144:46.15]We were.
[144:47.45]I didn't use my flask at all.
[144:49.46]I just fucked up.
[144:51.40]Alright, let's get them.
[144:52.46]No mistakes.
[144:54.39]Only gaming ability.
[144:56.10]Yeah, I don't have a talent stab jet for some reason.
[145:00.88]I don't think I did the quiz.
[145:15.18]Thought I hit that too shit, man
[145:28.44]Thank you for watching
[145:45.65]That combo is so fucking scary.
[146:02.24]Where am I?
[146:09.65]Oh god.
[146:15.32]That's gonna...
[146:23.76]Almost got him.
[146:41.37]Let's go.
[146:41.98]God, I'm so bad at that.
[146:44.21]That's tricky.
[146:45.21]I just.
[146:48.38]He's going down.
[146:50.33]This is not going great for me.
[146:52.25]We just gotta take him down one more time.
[147:03.38]You still have heal?
[147:05.76]No, I'm just going to stall and keep doing my little puddle.
[147:13.59]Oh my god, I've gotten hit so many times from these guys.
[147:23.59]That heal is so good though.
[147:24.97]I bet you can probably upgrade it.
[147:28.36]Yup.
[147:30.13]Now, people are saying if I had my heavy attack unlocked, I can just spam heavy and it's like targeted heals with the fan.
[147:36.74]But I do not have that.
[147:38.12]I got hit so many times here, it sucks.
[147:48.57]Among us.
[147:55.69]Good parry, good parry!
[148:08.85]Yeah, last time I was interrupting him a lot out of the red attack, but that's like the time to get him.
[148:17.70]Oh, what even hit me?
[148:21.77]I think he's still doing the right attack to you.
[148:25.15]I wasn't sure.
[148:30.28]Oh no.
[148:42.20]I feel like this would be so easy if I had the heavy attack.
[148:46.68]Or the talent tree.
[148:48.49]We're doing fine.
[148:48.95]We're doing fine.
[148:49.51]He's almost dead.
[148:54.79]He's not almost dead, man.
[148:56.45]That's his stun bar.
[149:08.79]Okay, let's go.
[149:16.78]Fuck, he needs another hit.
[149:18.04]Oh my god, he needs like a whole...
[149:19.63]I thought that was it for some reason.
[149:22.21]Mm-mm.
[149:33.72]You're about to be the hero.
[149:45.83]You just need to parry that four more times.
[149:59.91]He's got so much armor in this phase!
[150:01.88]Fuck!
[150:07.06]I mean, honestly, if you just bait the dash run up, you'll get them.
[150:10.15]I know.
[150:10.83]That's what I'm going to try to do.
[150:17.96]Oh my god!
[150:24.86]I didn't do it!
[150:27.89]We need like 10% more.
[150:30.10]I think there is another phase after that too.
[150:33.22]Because he still has a red orb at that point.
[150:34.86]He's gonna have like a no health after that.
[150:37.07]Oh man, that's crazy.
[150:39.03]Okay.
[150:40.34]You give me one more jug?
[150:43.12]We could do the Jug quest.
[150:46.23]We could do the Jug quest.
[150:47.44]We're so close.
[150:48.24]Alright, is that it though?
[150:49.90]That's the last phase apparently.
[150:51.07]That's it.
[150:51.59]Yeah.
[150:54.09]Oh, that's the last phase.
[150:55.32]We can beat him.
[150:57.08]Dude, we gotta do Jug Quest.
[150:58.31]Let's go do two Jug Quests.
[150:59.41]I could have rezzed you if I lived, and then you basically have another Jug.
[151:03.73]We gotta do Jug Quest.
[151:06.90]Okay.
[151:07.62]This thing is recommended for level 30.
[151:10.36]Is it?
[151:13.05]Yeah, but we're like gamers.
[151:17.97]When you get a stamina bar down, don't immediately go for a finisher.
[151:20.56]Just hit him a bunch while he's recovering, then do finisher.
[151:24.78]Okay, that's the tech.
[151:25.66]Now we're ready.
[151:26.66]You want to do this with one flask still?
[151:28.61]You're wild.
[151:35.35]as long as we stall, I can keep healing I just...
[151:40.21]I died in a really bad spot
[151:49.31]It's gonna hit me every time.
[152:17.66]Thank you.
[152:26.69]Damn it, I did the finisher too quickly.
[152:28.39]It just popped up on my screen and I freaked out.
[152:35.46]That shoulder tackle just gets me every time.
[152:51.48]Oh my god, the delay!
[153:01.94]That was a bad thing to jump into.
[153:11.00]Go!
[153:21.87]He's almost down.
[153:22.73]That was so unfortunate.
[153:25.41]You have no idea.
[153:27.57]That was so unfortunate.
[153:29.79]That was just bad timing all around there.
[153:31.88]I saw him.
[153:32.57]Yeah, you can't knock them out of the gold attack either.
[153:34.53]I did that before.
[153:35.44]I thought you might have been able to.
[153:36.66]You jump kick them and it's like, oh, well, you're getting hit now.
[153:43.91]Oh you're down?
[153:44.90]Yeah he can kill me with it.
[153:49.02]Alright, let's be stall stall stall stall.
[153:54.80]The 15 second cooldown for the heel.
[153:58.99]Okay.
[154:06.78]Okay.
[154:08.98]Oh, it is 20.
[154:11.65]Alright, I'm back to full health.
[154:16.33]I got a heal still.
[154:17.25]Alright, you guys ready?
[154:17.98]Let's lock in.
[154:23.39]Yeah, if you see someone get hit by the slam then jump on his head.
[154:27.68]It's so he doesn't keep comboing.
[154:34.75]No way.
[154:38.53]Get off!
[154:38.93]I don't want a fucking friend request!
[154:44.59]Good.
[154:54.31]You doing good?
[155:05.08]Nice dodge roll, bro.
[155:08.43]Coming to you.
[155:15.94]Okay.
[155:35.94]That move is a good thing to get him out of.
[155:39.49]Yeah, that's what I said.
[155:40.22]You're so true and real for that.
[155:53.61]Alright, we should beat the fuck out of him first before we do a finisher.
[155:56.54]I'm choking on my own spit.
[155:58.85]Mm-hmm.
[156:04.34]Yeah, you have the full timer on that button.
[156:07.50]I see.
[156:08.18]Can we do it?
[156:10.47]Oh, you just did it.
[156:10.97]Nice.
[156:11.13]Okay, let's go.
[156:11.74]Dude, he's almost dead.
[156:16.25]Aww.
[156:16.80]I didn't know what he was doing.
[156:19.13]He freaked out.
[156:19.73]Yeah.
[156:47.84]Thank you.
[156:55.91]Good.
[156:58.74]Kill him!
[157:01.41]Yeah!
[157:09.65]come on
[157:23.01]Phase three?
[157:24.04]Oh, no.
[157:24.86]No, I don't think so.
[157:26.05]There's six of them in phase three.
[157:35.03]See?
[157:42.55]I want to see the goose you don't want to fight the goose you don't want to fight the he's evil the goose was doing more damage than that guy was
[157:57.20]Okay.
[157:58.55]Exquisite... We got a... Oh, medicinal stuff.
[158:01.14]We got a lot of stuff.
[158:04.74]I gained ambition.
[158:07.39]I forgot how ugly I was.
[158:13.77]Cool.
[158:14.81]Well, there you have it.
[158:18.13]There it is.
[158:18.70]Where winds meet.
[158:21.94]Where do they meet?
[158:23.81]Right here.
[158:25.84]Yeah, they give you...
[158:26.56]It's too bad it didn't show, but in the tutorial, they give you the fully juiced character to let you know.
[158:31.22]And you get two full slots of abilities, and right now all we have is the jump air kick.
[158:37.94]Do you get like eight of those?
[158:39.46]We probably should have actually done that in like five levels with like three different moves.
[158:46.41]Red mist beetle.
[158:49.34]Cool.
[158:50.87]Can we pick it up?
[158:54.64]It was a fun game.
[158:55.29]It was cool.
[158:55.73]Thanks to the sponsor, Everstone Studio.
[158:57.78]Again, games free to play.
[158:59.91]And it seems like there's a lot of stuff to do.
[159:02.78]There's a lot of minigames, a lot of fun, a lot of PvP, a lot of social, fun, multiplayer stuff you can do with your friends.
[159:09.22]No pay to win.
[159:10.33]It's cosmetics and a battle pass for anything that you pay for.
[159:19.09]Cosmetics monthly pass and battle pass.
[159:21.07]There's no real pay to win.
[159:22.94]Yeah, it's just retry the boss eight times to win.
[159:40.10]Dude, kick their ass!
[159:44.51]Okay.
[159:46.11]What are you up to?
[159:47.82]How are you feeling?
[159:50.07]I could follow your lead.
[159:51.23]I don't know if you want it.
[159:52.06]What do you want to do?
[159:53.00]What are you feeling?
[159:54.03]This is a rhythm game that I was wanting to check out.
[159:55.91]We could go back and play the zombie game.
[159:57.52]I kind of want to try that zombie game with the horsemen.
[160:01.60]Okay.
[160:02.67]I feel like it's a fun game.
[160:04.31]I feel like that would be a fun one.
[160:06.98]People want you to fight the goose.
[160:08.69]A single player?
[160:09.47]I would like to at least see the goose.
[160:11.48]Let's go see the goose.
[160:12.21]The goose was in the town.
[160:13.05]The... What town was it?
[160:14.66]The second town I found?
[160:17.57]What town was that goose?
[160:21.01]Recommended stages?
[160:24.01]I don't...
[160:24.25]This is how we started the dungeon.
[160:25.45]It just says like, hey, a warning, a recommended co-op mission.
[160:30.95]Where are we?
[160:31.45]I don't know Where did you take us?
[160:39.91]Oh this was the destroyed castle nearby.
[160:41.86]Oh this is like a whole thing.
[160:45.29]Yeah.
[160:46.49]I don't know.
[160:46.91]I've also just been enjoying this game.
[160:48.38]I know.
[160:49.12]You can wall run.
[160:50.77]Jump at the wall.
[160:51.43]You can run up the wall.
[160:54.62]You actually can.
[161:07.28]Oh, there's like a you can just stay on the wall forever.
[161:09.78]There really is a treasure.
[161:17.34]This isn't a goose.
[161:18.82]Well, we gotta talk to this guy.
[161:21.19]Are you after the treasures of the Northern Val as well?
[161:23.88]Keep it down.
[161:25.10]Don't alert anyone inside.
[161:26.83]Northern Val?
[161:28.39]Go to the small island?
[161:29.86]At the fire icon, there's a small island.
[161:32.37]Okay.
[161:33.41]Let's go to the small island.
[161:36.61]Hold on, there's another boss, like, right here.
[161:38.44]It's just the guy in the middle of this.
[161:40.47]You found a treasure map.
[161:42.26]Was he going in?
[161:44.18]Yeah.
[161:48.94]I think I overheard them talking about treasure.
[161:53.20]I don't have fire arrows anymore.
[161:56.41]What are you doing?
[161:57.29]I'm going in.
[162:06.34]Yeah, when you hit the F button the entire time that the timer around is going down, you don't have to press it yet, and they're stunned.
[162:13.37]Oh, really?
[162:23.23]Don't forget you have the slow-mo thing to do, right?
[162:26.14]Oh, you can't do still water in online mode.
[162:28.15]That's funny.
[162:29.21]Yeah, because you can't stop my time.
[162:31.22]If only.
[162:39.45]Where's this boss you're talking about?
[162:42.02]Just up here in this arena.
[162:42.99]There was like one big guy.
[162:45.98]Zhang Bao.
[162:49.17]Secrets at home.
[162:52.48]You didn't want to listen to their little dialog?
[162:55.25]Oh, I think, again, because it's your game, I can't hear them.
[162:58.20]Oh.
[162:58.73]Okay, yeah, he is actually.
[162:59.85]He's going to health bar.
[163:09.10]There's also the explosive barrels.
[163:10.36]I don't have...
[163:11.11]I shot all my fire arrows into that guy before.
[163:16.26]I thought I just cut him in half.
[163:17.06]That was...
[163:17.42]Okay, I got it.
[163:28.57]Oh sorry, we've been training on the level 30 guy.
[163:32.94]Without all of our abilities.
[163:36.23]We're ready.
[163:41.84]You do have a pretty long time to activate a finisher.
[163:47.36]Dude had a, uh...
[163:49.27]There's the chest right here.
[163:55.12]Clue two, the treasure map.
[163:56.86]Oh, we got to go find this.
[164:01.67]Oh, there's a secret chamber here.
[164:03.18]That was the clue.
[164:04.25]It's like the map you see?
[164:08.01]That's a map of where we are.
[164:09.64]What?
[164:11.95]The plot thickens, dude.
[164:21.93]Somebody said they wanted this for the whole stream and I haven't given it to them.
[164:24.56]Here, hold on.
[164:43.52]We've searched for hours and found nothing.
[164:51.73]Bandit talking.
[164:52.52]Give it to him.
[164:54.15]Oh, there's a lot of people talking right now.
[165:02.57]But what about us?
[165:04.04]Are we supposed to stay in this ruined place forever?
[165:07.92]Who knows if this treasure is even real?
[165:12.91]Locked on the other side?
[165:13.84]Yeah, right.
[165:15.06]I can take care of that.
[165:17.84]Never mind.
[165:26.68]uh let's go back to that island because people want you to fight with apparently there's a big goose apparently what do you mean apparently I don't know apparently there's a goose
[165:38.02]Somebody said there's a there's a different goose that we haven't seen.
[165:40.17]There's a little island next to the fire.
[165:42.73]Like right here.
[165:43.31]Okay.
[165:53.97]Apparently the Renaissance men are coming to town is what it says.
[165:59.38]What does that mean?
[166:00.94]Guess I will just follow you.
[166:04.60]Wrong fire.
[166:05.73]The other one.
[166:08.10]Oh, this one here.
[166:09.05]Okay.
[166:10.19]Can you come to... Moonvale Mountain.
[166:12.22]Can you come to be... Yeah, the one that's in the middle over here?
[166:15.94]Oh, another Moonvale user.
[166:19.10]I don't know.
[166:19.40]It just says that they're coming.
[166:20.38]I know, but what do you mean by that?
[166:22.99]Who are the Renaissance men?
[166:24.67]I don't get it.
[166:27.38]That's a great show.
[166:30.86]Apparently on this island, there's a goose for you to fight.
[166:34.59]For me?
[166:35.33]Yes.
[166:36.20]Oh, I see.
[166:36.54]There's like a goose icon.
[166:38.79]Is there?
[166:42.01]Somebody come on this island.
[166:58.16]This is just the cat collect.
[167:00.38]Okay, cat.
[167:01.10]Collect-a-thon.
[167:02.27]You're looking for a goose.
[167:09.15]We can just go to the town, Goose.
[167:10.37]That one was just as powerful as whatever this one would be.
[167:17.62]You alright?
[167:19.12]Yeah, I was canceling the cat thing.
[167:24.54]Yeah, where's the goose?
[167:26.36]I was told there was a goose on this island.
[167:28.07]Did I get baited?
[167:28.69]I think you're being lied to.
[167:31.48]Well, okay, I should have known better.
[167:32.56]They called it a demon goose.
[167:37.41]So they were just lying to us.
[167:41.63]Could be a world boss event.
[167:43.77]Alright, well let's go fight the regular one.
[167:46.32]The regular goose up in this town over here.
[167:51.25]Where was it?
[167:51.59]Right here?
[167:56.68]I swear to God, it's on the east of that island.
[168:02.52]Hey, you swear to God?
[168:07.96]I'm playing pots with a guy.
[168:20.29]I don't see it anywhere.
[168:24.25]Okay, well.
[168:25.60]If you come to me, we can find... You can fight the regular goose.
[168:29.52]Somebody said it's probably a quest.
[168:30.81]Yeah.
[168:35.50]I don't...
[168:38.91]I'm playing, yeah, I'm playing beer pong.
[168:49.42]Yeah, I knew I liked you, dude.
[168:52.57]I love you too.
[169:03.19]Alright, come to me.

[170:53.17]I know!
[170:53.63]Together I don't even think we can kill it.

[171:31.71]We get a goose pet to fight with us.
[171:38.24]Yeah, I think I'm not actually unlocking any of these things on co-op, unfortunately.
[171:48.63]I think only you got the goose.
[171:49.80]That's crazy that you can do that.
[171:53.87]I'm surprised I haven't gone to jail yet.
[172:02.79]Okay.
[172:13.00]Check the mounts?
[172:13.74]There's one where you are just pulled by dogs or geese.
[172:17.19]Really?
[172:23.38]Where would that be?
[172:26.69]Yo ho.
[172:30.50]It's in the shop.
[172:34.78]Appearances.
[172:35.63]It's so great because when we see the face.
[172:43.21]Take the mask off, come on.
[172:46.01]Oh man, I thought it was going to be the reveal of my face.
[172:52.89]What does that mask even look like if you wear it?
[172:55.35]I don't know.
[172:55.98]Can it even fit?
[172:57.50]in the beginning uh starting area I found like a equippable mask maybe you didn't get it I like this one
[173:13.87]Imagine my character with this on.
[173:17.52]Climbing the mountain.
[173:22.57]Okay, is it, you said Mounts?
[173:32.62]appearances.
[173:33.20]Oh, here we go.
[173:35.26]What the hell?
[173:36.27]Okay, that's crazy.
[173:38.64]Dude, go to appearances, go to the shop, then go to appearance and go look at this crazy one that is like a cartoon character.
[173:47.97]Go to appearance?
[173:49.46]Go to... Yeah, go to your shop.
[173:52.84]I'm in appearance, but there's like...
[173:56.88]Okay, I go to the menu, I click appearance.
[174:00.43]And then appearance, you said?
[174:01.63]No, no shop, then appearance, then mounts.
[174:05.49]It's like a tab on the left.
[174:07.92]did not say shop you lied yeah I did I said shop like three times not the first time I don't have any coins
[174:20.08]Which one do you want me to see?
[174:21.18]The first one.
[174:22.57]Do you see the character running?
[174:24.43]That is what I asked you to click in for.
[174:30.26]Can you imagine running through a town like this and just smashing everybody?
[174:34.62]Oh, Snow Oath.
[174:38.32]That's funny.
[174:39.69]Alright, this one is the one everybody wants.
[174:42.22]Oh my God.
[174:45.97]Wait, appearance level?
[174:47.32]You can make the appearance level higher so there's more geese that you ride on?
[174:58.39]You can just be like a dog walker and run around.
[175:00.50]They just pull you.
[175:01.24]I want the appearance level five dog walker.
[175:11.11]These are perfectly goofy.
[175:17.29]There's weapon skins in here too.
[175:20.48]I imagine that these probably change out weapon effects.
[175:32.43]Ink Splash.
[175:41.57]That guy, yeah, that guy got fucked up bad.
[175:43.64]That's cool.

[175:55.41]Ooh.
[175:57.00]Ooh.
[176:01.64]Ooh, bucket.
[176:09.38]You gotta have a bucket.
[176:14.40]I mean all the they're all really nice looking.
[176:25.43]The Looney Tunes legs are the perfect thing.
[176:28.05]It is.
[176:28.53]How do you go up from there?
[176:32.07]There are a lot of these
[176:35.78]Press T?
[176:36.54]Oh!
[176:38.61]That's right, exactly what I was looking for.
[176:49.31]Oh, dear.
[176:50.40]I love how it says recommended appearance.
[176:55.17]Not who you are.
[176:57.12]Yeah, like you look the way you do, but this is recommended.
[177:02.00]Yeah, this is the way we really want you to be here.
[177:05.07]That's so funny.
[177:09.23]I will say though, like I said in the beginning,
[177:13.10]I can always tell like a game if I like it or not.
[177:16.34]And this is so, this is stupid.
[177:18.96]But if the game doesn't care if you're ugly, do you know what I mean by that?
[177:25.93]The game does not care if you're ugly.
[177:29.36]You can walk around like this and the whole game is ready and available looking like this.
[177:36.05]Some games give you a slider and it's like, oh, I dropped the chin by like,
[177:40.85]one millimeter and the eye spacing you see this corner is here instead of here no dude let me
[177:50.01]Let me go wild.
[177:56.29]Can't attack children.
[178:01.06]I love this hairstyle.
[178:09.91]Do the mask one?
[178:11.21]Wait, yeah.
[178:14.52]Can I see the cutscene again?
[178:19.73]What if I exit and come back?
[178:29.70]Oh no, I can't see the cutscene again.
[178:33.77]Going to the top of the world.
[178:43.86]Video on right.
[178:48.99]I don't think it's going to be my character, though.
[178:51.28]I think it's a... Yeah, it's a pre-rendered video.
[178:55.03]Wait.
[178:58.30]No, I can't.
[179:08.01]Go to the mast item and... Are you alright?
[179:11.65]Yeah.
[179:13.00]Wait, what the fuck?
[179:13.72]I can't double jump in here.
[179:18.15]Where is that item?
[179:23.53]There's a mask in the clothing one.
[179:24.87]I mean, there's this one.
[179:27.78]Where is that one?
[179:30.06]I think the mask is just off when you look at it.
[179:37.08]in my own inventory.
[179:40.82]Really?
[179:42.32]Menu appearance preview all locked items.
[179:47.12]That's a lot of stuff for the head.
[180:06.04]Man, this game is so post of the co-op killed.
[180:11.06]This game loves you.
[180:12.18]That mask does not fit.
[180:14.99]These ones do.
[180:27.01]I kind of love this one.
[180:36.99]Yippee.
[180:38.39]Okay.
[180:41.50]I think I'm good to call it here for now.
[180:45.86]This is cool though.
[180:51.06]I got to the top of the world.
[180:52.47]I'm satisfied.
[180:55.34]How'd you go all the way up to the mountain?
[180:58.05]Yeah, and I climbed the top tower.
[181:01.36]Very cool.
[181:03.58]I can see the goose from up here.
[181:05.25]Do you...
[181:08.54]I don't know.
[181:09.77]Is the rhythm game co-op?
[181:11.57]It might be.
[181:12.18]I can check.
[181:15.29]If it's not, that's cool.
[181:16.66]I can go do something.
[181:18.79]Well, it was good to play with you.
[181:20.11]Thanks for hanging out.
[181:21.16]Everyone say bye to Ster because I don't think it is co-op.
[181:25.44]Bye, sir.
[181:28.99]Very fun times.
[181:30.07]We actually should play that with four people.
[181:32.92]I feel like it would be good with four people.
[181:35.38]Yep.
[181:35.78]And the other game I suggested I'm really looking forward to.
[181:37.97]Whenever the next Horseman is, we got games.
[181:40.20]We got games.
[181:42.52]Alright.
[181:43.13]I'll talk to you soon, dude.
[181:44.64]Bye bye.
[181:46.53]I'm gonna exit.
[181:53.89]Yeah, I had to capture desktop.
[181:55.35]So people like what the hell is this?
[181:58.71]Okay, so I'm gonna take a quick break.
[182:01.80]All those sponsor stuff can come off.
[182:04.61]Thank you so much for the sponsor.
[182:05.67]That game was actually really fun.
[182:07.44]I'm actually looking forward to playing that a little more.
[182:10.61]It seemed like a good combination of fun co-op.
[182:16.10]You can do single player or multiplayer.
[182:20.31]There's a ton of minigames.
[182:21.28]I'm very interested.
[182:27.59]But yeah.
[182:29.63]It's out.
[182:31.19]Go get it again.
[182:32.08]It's on Steam.
[182:33.70]Where Winds Meet.
[182:35.33]Seems like a fun freaking time.
[182:38.34]I'll be right back.
[182:40.97]We'll try this rhythm game.
