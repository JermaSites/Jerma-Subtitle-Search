[00:05.31]You don't even want to play this game because you saw someone else play it.
[00:08.85]I saw someone else play this game, so I don't even want to touch it.
[00:13.48]Oh, that's great.
[00:14.04]Now I don't have a sword.
[00:15.76]Nice try.
[00:16.82]What?
[00:17.96]What the hell's... No!
[00:23.70]We're just gonna keep throwing swords at each other.
[00:26.65]Nope.
[00:27.05]What the fuck just happened?
[00:28.49]I'm going for the gold.
[00:31.01]Seriously, do I have to just chase you?
[00:33.25]You have to kill me before I can pass you.
[00:34.71]What the fuck is going on?
[00:37.13]You have to kill me!
[00:38.89]This is Nidhogg!
[00:39.99]Come on!
[00:41.01]You get to the end, you get eaten by the giant worm!
[00:43.49]What the fuck just- what happened?
[00:45.85]Hey, thanks everybody for coming to the video.
[00:47.61]That was, uh, Jerma versus Star in Nidhogg.
[00:50.10]See you later.
[00:53.10]Who's that?
[00:53.94]Who's that?
[00:55.06]Who's coming?
[00:56.44]Is it me?
[00:57.04]I think I saw him.
[00:59.68]Nooo!
[01:02.42]Dealt with.
[01:03.82]I think this is why you didn't want to play.
[01:06.93]Well, if you didn't teleport across the fucking screen on that, like, second map... Everyone saw it.
[01:12.53]Serious.
[01:12.93]I'm dead serious.
[01:15.61]I'm dead.
[01:16.19]You're not serious enough.
[01:20.41]They're all cheering for me, even though they didn't see any of the fight leading up to this worm eating me.
[01:25.87]They're all really happy for me.
[01:28.45]You see, the one thing that you're gonna try to take away from this is... No... That barely hit you, too.
[01:41.96]Here he is just running away.
[01:43.62]That's what he does.
[01:45.64]Because you gotta win.
[01:48.94]Ow.
[01:49.30]Why don't you go play like Super Mario and like run to the right of the screen some more?
[01:54.82]No, why don't you go?
[01:55.62]I'll just run to the left.
[01:56.80]Oh, he's running to the left.
[01:57.50]I killed him three times.
[02:03.82]Why don't you put a high five?
[02:05.29]There he goes.
[02:05.91]There he goes.
[02:09.97]Okay, bye.
[02:17.85]I hate you.
[02:18.79]I hate you so much, so I'm enjoying this so, so much.
[02:25.47]This is like the most painful gaming experience you've ever had.
[02:28.23]Oh my god, dude, seriously?
[02:34.31]Like, really?
[02:36.33]Hey, how about you, like, fucking fight me?
[02:38.13]Okay, you want to fight right now?
[02:40.29]You want to fight right now?
[02:41.07]You want to fight me right now?
[02:42.11]I do.
[02:42.87]Get the fuck out of my face!
[02:44.14]Oh, he did it again!
[02:51.80]Oh, shit.
[02:56.92]This game is honestly not even that fun.
[03:01.52]Let's tell you, when you, like, start to lose in a game, it automatically just becomes a bad game.
[03:07.80]Is that, like, really what's happening right now?
[03:09.74]Yeah, this game is kind of dumb.
[03:11.36]This game's, like, not even, like, that fun of a game.
[03:13.46]It, like, kind of sucks.
[03:14.48]Yeah, like, what even is a Nidhogg?
[03:16.38]Like, what does that mean?
[03:17.24]It doesn't mean anything to me.
[03:19.26]It was fun in the beginning.
[03:20.19]I'm not feeling it anymore, you know?
[03:21.79]It's not really a good game anymore.
[03:27.77]Jumping is weird in this.
[03:29.15]We're done.
[03:29.55]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:31.03]I don't want to play anymore.
[03:33.11]You can't just like because you can't flawless me.
[03:35.17]Just quit the game.
[03:36.03]This isn't fun anymore.
[03:38.99]He's so confident until he starts to slip up a little bit and then all of a sudden the game's not even fun.
[03:45.96]You want me to win?
[03:46.54]Oh, I jumped.
[03:47.30]Oh, bye.
[03:49.08]Okay, bye.
[03:49.68]Okay, I'm going to beat Jerma.
[03:51.70]Oh, I run forward.
[03:54.48]Okay, stab him in the head.
[03:55.70]Stab him.
[03:56.22]Oh, shit.
[03:58.73]I run, jump, okay.
[04:01.13]This is what we're talking about here.
[04:02.21]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Nidhogg, which is a 1v1v1v1 competitive fighting game.
[04:08.14]As you see here, throwing the knife at Sarf, doing his best fucking Super Mario Bros.
[04:13.59]3 impression.
[04:15.39]Okay, this is for all the money.
[04:17.31]Whoever wins this has to sing the other person a song.
[04:19.67]Okay, fine.
[04:20.19]Ready?
[04:20.35]Here we go.
[04:22.92]Oh, nice try, nice try, but I'm a connoisseur of sorts of, uh, having songs sung for them.
[04:28.24]It's a passion of mine, really.
[04:29.78]Oh, shit!
[04:32.68]You had to spawn the second I got there.
[04:36.30]It happened to you too, but it didn't... I outplayed you.
[04:41.88]You think I'm gonna jump on... No!
[04:46.32]Ah, right proper fight in our hands.
[04:47.50]Was it gonna be up, down, up, down?
[04:49.52]What do you think, I'm gonna stab you?
[04:52.73]He's in your head.
[04:55.82]What the fuck?
[04:56.28]You're just a punk!
[04:56.88]That's all you are!
[04:57.36]That's it, if I do that again, I'm gonna scrape you.
[05:03.06]Kill me!
[05:03.38]No!
[05:03.68]Oh, star!
[05:04.16]You are so wonderful, here's your song!
