[00:59.56]The only thing I hate more than Jerma is Wade Box.
[01:03.11]May he rest in peace.
[01:06.01]Just like that.
[01:07.63]$1 right off the bat.
[01:08.17]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the VR stream.
[01:11.65]How you doing?
[01:12.15]Wait, where's the chat?
[01:13.27]Oh, fuck.
[01:15.58]Idiot.
[01:17.10]He's a fucking idiot.
[01:18.90]He's just a stupid idiot.
[01:21.56]There it is.
[01:23.53]uh elgato HD 60 pro version I needed to do an update apparently like right when I decided to start streaming it was already plugged in it's been plugged in for like four hours why did you do this to me uh anyways hi how you doing my name is
[01:50.72]And today, we're gonna play Doki Do- No, that was a lie.
[01:55.97]I'm just having fun with chat there for a minute.
[01:59.91]No, we're gonna play VR.
[02:01.93]Because Until Dawn came out with a prequel for no reason.
[02:06.97]I guess there's a VR prequel.
[02:09.68]And we're gonna play it.
[02:10.24]We're gonna try it out.
[02:12.66]So give me one moment so we can start it.
[02:16.20]I gotta put the helmet on.
[02:19.38]And I'm gonna put it over to the webcam and you guys are gonna be able to see the funny guy in the VR helmet do some funny VR stuff, right?
[02:25.29]Oh shit.
[02:25.97]Wait, I gotta mute the mic so you don't let him blow at your eardrums.
[02:53.47]Okay, take some bets on whether or not I smash my hand on the mic tonight.
[03:01.48]It's a very real possibility.
[03:03.14]First of all, let's turn on these two funny controllers.
[03:06.54]Hopefully they're charged enough.
[03:08.06]Oh boy, would that be bad if they weren't.
[03:11.16]Sure I wouldn't hear the end of that one.
[03:12.57]I think they're good.
[03:17.13]They were charging for like five hours.
[03:20.90]There's no way they're gonna not be charged.
[03:22.54]So one of them's like not even halfway, but like who gives a shit?
[03:26.48]This is gonna be like a not even halfway stream anyway, so who cares?
[03:29.35]Good thing that's never happened before.
[03:33.65]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[03:39.49]These controllers are fucking hilarious.
[03:45.46]Wait, let me put this, here we go.
[03:46.76]Alright, I made my tweet.
[03:51.94]I'm gonna play the Star Wars prequels.
[03:54.88]Hopefully this game's good.
[03:56.48]Because if not, then, uh... Well, folks!
[04:00.48]See you tomorrow!
[04:01.26]Alright, let me get in here.
[04:07.17]Alright, I got clothes on, right?
[04:08.59]I think so.
[04:10.33]I hope so.
[04:10.79]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[04:11.97]We gotta put the fucking camera on!
[04:13.29]What am I, some kind of amateur streamer?
[04:15.31]Oh!
[04:21.15]Hey!
[04:22.61]Hey, I just like appeared with this on.
[04:24.27]We're going digging today.
[04:25.73]There we go.
[04:29.18]It's called the Impatient.
[04:31.68]I probably should put these in, huh?
[04:34.10]Please start.
[04:37.04]This is by the same people.
[04:38.72]Oh, I can only put these in.
[04:39.74]Hopefully I can hear this.
[04:41.34]Otherwise this is going to be real awkward if I can't hear the game.
[04:49.11]Can I hear the game?
[04:51.96]Yeah!
[04:52.70]Warning.
[04:54.08]Before using, please consult a physician.
[04:57.78]And then spit in his face.
[05:03.99]The VR headset is not to be used by children under 12, by the way.
[05:11.49]Alright, you gotta tell- I gotta see if it's too loud first.
[05:16.64]Yes!
[05:19.90]Why is it backwards?
[05:21.95]Is it backwards for you guys too?
[05:23.86]Room is clear, see?
[05:24.86]All I got is a chair back here.
[05:26.80]Alright, it's a drinking stream?
[05:32.52]No, it's not.
[05:33.04]Oh my God, I look like fucking Christopher Lloyd.
[05:40.24]This is gonna be bad.
[05:42.12]Every fucking time.
[05:44.58]I rip out like two years worth of hair every time I play VR.
[05:47.74]Alright, it looks good.
[05:49.64]How's the audio, good?
[05:53.32]Hopefully these are the right hands.
[05:54.22]I've got to put the safety straps on.
[05:58.13]Remember, this is Until Dawn's prequel.
[06:01.65]This is going to be a scary game, right?
[06:04.07]Because I play all kinds of those.
[06:07.23]It's a very large game.
[06:08.27]It's a massive game.
[06:09.29]There's lots of content.
[06:10.25]It's two hours long.
[06:11.90]And it's $40.
[06:12.16]So... Yeah.
[06:16.30]Hope it's worth it.
[06:18.60]Otherwise, we're going home.
[06:20.92]By the way, I can't see bits...
[06:23.26]I can't see any donations or anything like that, so bear with me here.
[06:26.77]Alright, I'm gonna get... How's the audio?
[06:27.97]We good?
[06:28.93]Turn it up?
[06:30.27]I'll turn it up.
[06:33.83]That might be too loud.
[06:37.65]I'm gonna have to check this.
[06:39.09]Let's go to settings.
[06:40.65]Are these in the right hands?
[06:46.04]I want to change this.
[06:46.76]Hold on a minute.
[06:48.48]I want you guys to be able to see my fucking face.
[06:53.39]That's where the money is.
[06:54.43]You know what I mean?
[06:54.85]That's where the real money is.
[07:00.31]What's that?
[07:02.88]What's that?
[07:03.20]Better?
[07:03.44]Fuck.
[07:07.00]No thanks.
[07:09.92]Then we go like this.
[07:12.04]Somebody just gave $50 and I don't know who it was.
[07:15.28]I don't know who it was.
[07:16.70]Like there?
[07:18.15]Right there, right?
[07:19.39]I want to calibrate this shit too.
[07:26.71]Alright, who gave the money?
[07:27.45]Alright, Ben Eleanor gave 50 fucking dollars.
[07:30.63]Bet he'll see this one.
[07:31.67]You know, you were right.
[07:33.75]I do see this.
[07:38.29]Alright, that looks good.
[07:39.41]This is fucking way too loud, so I'm going to turn it down a little bit.
[07:41.77]I don't care if you guys complain.
[07:43.43]That's how it's going to be.
[07:44.79]Wait, let's get inside and then calibrate.
[07:48.97]God damn it.
[07:52.13]I'm going to be the first dude that gets to fucking VR implant his brain.
[07:57.21]This shit is just too much, you know?
[07:59.91]It just really is.
[08:00.53]Alright, rotation, subtitles.
[08:03.71]Why does this feel like I'm underwater?
[08:06.38]Voice control is on.
[08:07.60]This is a game you control with your voice.
[08:11.32]Okay.
[08:12.50]Put the subtitles on.
[08:13.54]Voice control on.
[08:15.50]Credits.
[08:16.16]Rotations do... 30, I think.
[08:19.83]Let's give that a try.
[08:21.61]I think that's alright.
[08:24.01]Start the game.
[08:27.53]Alright, start game.
[08:31.83]New game.
[08:32.33]Memories.
[08:32.85]The Butterfly Effect.
[08:33.79]Let's go with new game.
[08:38.05]Male or female?
[08:41.45]Male.
[08:43.25]Select skin tone.
[08:49.04]I mean, I'm pretty much like a porcelain doll.
[08:50.54]I have ghost skin.
[08:58.88]What do you want me to tell you?
[09:00.46]Syringe.
[09:08.23]It's not good enough.
[09:08.87]I gotta open up another one.
[09:09.95]This one was like already almost gone.
[09:15.93]This game allows you to speak out loud to make choices.
[09:18.38]Would you like to enable voice control?
[09:20.00]Speak out loud to make your... Yes.
[09:23.18]Yes, please.
[09:23.72]Yes, please.
[09:25.84]Yes, please.
[09:28.68]Yes, please.
[09:32.35]What?
[09:37.97]Okay.
[09:41.25]For voice control to work the best, ensure there is as little background noise as possible.
[09:47.70]This place is empty.
[09:50.18]Okay, I got my two hands.
[09:52.10]Roll the tape.
[09:53.31]I'd like to try it again.
[09:55.64]I'm in, this is like the part of Outlast where I get my hands cut off.
[09:58.82]Same guy, same doctor.
[10:01.78]Let's test your memory.
[10:04.72]Do you remember who I am?
[10:06.62]No.
[10:07.38]Wait, what?
[10:08.78]No, I don't.
[10:10.70]Oh.
[10:11.88]No, where am I?
[10:12.62]I am worried that you are holding back.
[10:18.54]What's the point of the voice control if like... Am I speaking with some emotion?
[10:29.08]Curious.
[10:35.40]Are you a doctor?
[10:38.61]I could just select them.
[10:39.57]Why would I need to say them?
[10:41.33]Doctor, yes.
[10:44.33]And now put somebody over there.
[10:47.31]Do you know why you're here?
[10:51.52]Pop up the two choices.
[10:56.34]Why am I restrained?
[11:00.37]That's going to be really annoying.
[11:01.83]I don't like that.
[11:02.55]I'm going to turn it off.
[11:04.09]Once you've recovered, you'll be free to leave.
[11:07.85]Close your eyes.
[11:10.25]Take a deep breath.
[11:12.58]Let the walls fall away.
[11:15.54]Try to visualize the last thing you can remember.
[11:19.30]Before you came here.
[11:21.12]I don't know.
[11:22.94]Ow.
[11:24.24]Okay.
[11:26.96]Here we go.
[11:29.71]Let's go ahead and leave.
[11:33.65]I didn't mean to make that much noise.
[11:37.45]I told you.
[11:38.13]He knew I was there.
[11:41.97]He was watching the stream and he heard me bump the mic.
[11:47.28]I'm going to back up.
[11:48.00]I'm going to do that again.
[11:49.44]Did you remember anything?
[11:55.02]No, I don't remember anything.
[11:58.36]No, I don't remember anything.
[12:01.62]Do I have to look at it?
[12:04.39]No, I don't remember anything.
[12:06.91]Well, that's, that's... I have to look at the cue cards.
[12:13.15]I'm just a fucking shitty actor.
[12:14.67]It's like Saturday Night Live.
[12:17.59]There's a guy holding a fucking cue card over there.
[12:20.15]Oh, I remember a light.
[12:23.93]I remember a light.
[12:26.51]I'm just going to pick it from now on.
[12:27.37]We're not even going to do voice control.
[12:28.37]Who cares?
[12:28.63]I'm going to try this again.
[12:34.44]So, please relax, take a deep breath.
[12:40.46]Think about that moment and concentrate.
[12:42.48]You know what's funny?
[12:43.43]I'm holding up his cue card.
[12:44.47]No matter how much it may scare or upset you, it's important you face the hard truth.
[12:48.41]Make sure you read those lines.
[12:49.57]I'm holding those up for you.
[12:51.37]Thank you for holding my lines up for me.
[12:57.49]Okay.
[12:59.31]Don't shoot me!
[13:04.07]What the fuck is this game?
[13:06.71]Oh, you need your lines?
[13:07.65]Go ahead.
[13:08.37]I remember the same thing.
[13:17.64]Go ahead, just select it.
[13:18.60]Just use my finger to do it.
[13:19.84]How's the audio?
[13:28.56]Somebody was coming for me.
[13:31.25]Someone was coming for me.
[13:32.51]Let me get those lines for you.
[13:34.09]Mm-hmm.
[13:35.17]How's the audio?
[13:36.57]Is this thing good?
[13:37.35]Is it too loud?
[13:38.57]Should I turn it down?
[13:39.53]Alright, I'm gonna be angry.
[13:58.81]Stop it, I've had enough!
[14:01.63]See, they can tell.
[14:03.57]This process can be extremely effective, but can also be difficult.
[14:06.88]Is it good?
[14:08.08]It's too quiet.
[14:10.06]One final thing, and it's the key to the success of this treatment.
[14:15.42]You do understand I want what's best for you.
[14:18.34]Alright, I got it a little higher.
[14:24.57]This isn't helping me.
[14:27.53]I hate this feature.
[14:30.88]seems like a waste of like six million dollars to put that in you know that had to have costed money to do that right they had to get like a voice recognition software to be there comes a syringe good good stick it in there now to rest stick it in here right in the neck let the memories come home to roost that's going right into my penis alright I'll have an order we take you to your room I thought he was going in here let's talk
[15:01.14]Alright, reach up and grab him and snap his neck.
[15:14.85]We gotta judge this game.
[15:16.47]We have to judge it accordingly.
[15:17.75]This game was $40.
[15:19.47]Let's see if it was worth it.
[15:22.61]Here we go, first combat.
[15:23.67]Never felt better.
[15:33.85]Good, good.
[15:34.93]Time to put you back on the shelf.
[15:36.79]Okay, yeah, go ahead and undo my... That little rag will take his toys apart just to see if he can put them back together again.
[15:42.38]Yeah.
[15:42.84]Hope he's not losing his touch.
[15:44.14]Mm-hmm.
[15:46.70]When do I get control of my hands?
[15:47.98]When can I, like, grab him by the head?
[15:55.33]Why am I going like this?
[16:03.95]Yeah, the butterfly effect.
[16:05.07]It's a movie with Ashton Kutcher.
[16:10.49]Small's decision could dramatically change the future.
[16:15.37]Sure it can.
[16:15.85]Here we go.
[16:16.79]God damn it.
[16:18.49]Give me control.
[16:20.59]Can I wheel?
[16:22.09]How did I end up here?
[16:23.46]Hi.
[16:24.82]Hello, Suzanne.
[16:27.90]Always good to see your face.
[16:31.82]Well, shoot.
[16:33.50]Guess I ain't fit to shine her shoes.
[16:36.42]You think a girl like that would ever give me the time of day?
[16:43.91]She's out of your league.
[16:44.71]I don't even give a damn.
[16:47.59]Who's talking, big guy?
[16:48.83]At least I ain't wearing prophylactic pajamas.
[16:51.67]Yeah.
[16:53.51]Push me.
[16:53.83]And I like to see him.
[16:57.76]That's fucking weird.
[17:01.95]Okay, I'm going to fall backwards if I do that anymore.
[17:04.69]I will fall backwards and smash my head on the ground.
[17:15.16]VR is fucked.
[17:17.02]It really is.
[17:17.68]It's just so messed up.
[17:21.60]Alright, this is a two hour game.
[17:23.70]We're already like 20 minutes into this game.
[17:25.67]We're already like...
[17:27.23]We're almost like a third of the way through this whole experience and I've just been a guy sitting in a chair watching people put cue cards in front of me.
[17:42.48]Let me just call us a cab.
[17:44.64]Now obviously this takes place, I think this takes place in like the 60s.
[17:49.72]Who am I?
[17:52.98]You?
[17:54.74]You're just another patient.
[17:56.35]An endless stream of patience for old Abe to push around.
[17:59.99]Okay.
[18:02.67]What is this place?
[18:03.41]I got it right.
[18:06.01]Hello, you get out much?
[18:07.75]We're in the world-famous Blackwood Sanatorium and Hotel.
[18:12.34]Well, not so much the hotel part.
[18:13.96]I don't know the hotel.
[18:14.68]But here we are.
[18:18.98]I'm going to need you to push me in here.
[18:20.58]You think baggots spring for an upgrade?
[18:22.79]For the staff's sake, at least.
[18:25.27]Whole place going to pieces.
[18:27.35]Why is he huge?
[18:29.29]He looks like abnormally big, doesn't he?
[18:32.39]He's like Andre the fucking Giant.
[18:37.67]I know I'm sitting in a chair, but he looks too wide.
[18:40.27]Let's not strain ourselves, eh?
[18:42.51]Coming down the home stretch.
[18:44.69]Oh, he actually got angry at me.
[18:47.17]I want to reach back and give this guy the stomach.
[18:57.26]Okay.
[19:00.97]End gate.
[19:02.27]Ah, duty calls.
[19:10.19]Alright.
[19:13.13]Undo my wrists.
[19:18.99]You know, give me like a paragraph about what just happened here, you know?
[19:26.33]What was that?
[19:27.33]There's gonna be like a fucking monster that comes down this hallway.
[19:33.99]No, it's not.
[19:35.43]It's just glasses Jerma again.
[19:36.91]Okay.
[19:46.40]I'm really immersed right now.
[19:54.41]Your story is one of many possibilities because the World of Warcraft, it's Kalimdor versus the Eastern Kingdoms.
[20:01.35]Choose your side carefully.
[20:03.63]Do you want to play in the fucking Alliance or the Horde?
[20:07.09]It's a tough call.
[20:12.82]Hey now, you're back.
[20:15.22]Just a little blackout, no big deal.
[20:17.66]All just part of the treatment.
[20:19.58]Almost back to your private little oasis.
[20:26.80]This sucks.
[20:41.55]You're okay.
[20:42.79]Look at me.
[20:44.01]Everything is going to be okay.
[20:47.58]When are they going to let me out of here?
[20:50.48]Alright.
[20:50.90]Lights out.
[20:52.10]Time for bed.
[20:53.18]And now here comes the fucking lights out monster.
[20:59.58]Yep.
[21:00.64]I'm ready.
[21:02.26]I'm ready to wake up in bed.
[21:06.22]Rise and shine.
[21:07.04]No, no, no.
[21:07.36]Give me my hands.
[21:08.08]It's a new day.
[21:08.66]Come on.
[21:09.55]Wakey, wakey.
[21:11.53]Up, up, up.
[21:12.23]Let's see what you got.
[21:13.17]Huh?
[21:14.05]Upsy-daisy.
[21:15.73]What do you want to do?
[21:19.65]Alright.
[21:20.37]This is the boxing tutorial, right?
[21:24.86]Why don't you take in the view?
[21:31.49]What did I tell you?
[21:32.93]I had odds on you.
[21:34.53]Gonna make me a rich man.
[21:36.41]White wall tires and a three martini lunch.
[21:38.91]You want a hug?
[21:40.49]Walk.
[21:41.87]Come to papa.
[21:42.73]How do you walk?
[21:44.31]Push on the left controller to move forward.
[21:47.08]There we go.
[21:48.66]Keep coming.
[21:50.60]Wow.
[21:51.72]Almost ready for the triathlon.
[21:53.74]I did it.
[21:54.20]Now let's try going back to the bed.
[21:56.86]Point the right controller behind you.
[21:58.74]Point the right controller behind you.
[22:07.51]That's weird, that's a weird way to do it, but that's fine.
[22:13.73]Point the right controller left or right and push to turn.
[22:18.54]That's awkward as hell.
[22:23.48]Okay.
[22:26.06]Well, this is not going to make me fucking throw up or anything.
[22:28.24]Alright, let's fucking grab him by the neck.
[22:32.24]I want you to just take your time.
[22:33.93]Move at your own pace.
[22:35.48]Take all day if you need to.
[22:37.14]Don't sweat off my back.
[22:38.40]Alright, here he comes.
[22:42.20]You know, on a clear day... Oh, shit, he has such an interesting quirk.
[22:45.42]He can stop me from punching him in midair.
[22:47.70]Yeah, I've been fucking watching that show.
[22:52.14]What are we doing?
[22:54.88]Why don't we stick around while you get your sea legs meeting?
[22:57.22]You know, I would like it if you fucking left, chump.
[23:05.00]I would prefer some space.
[23:08.43]Who asked you anyway, eh?
[23:15.39]Let's just do what he wants.
[23:17.21]Walk around, stretch.
[23:19.60]Grab the notebook.
[23:22.34]Take a look.
[23:24.10]I've got to turn this around.
[23:25.04]I've got to get some... What is this?
[23:33.66]Abe and Suzanne's date.
[23:37.66]Trip to the movies.
[23:39.30]Saturday night dancing.
[23:41.20]Walk together in the woods.
[23:42.59]She's seeing that man!
[23:44.89]Yeesh.
[23:45.87]Guy can't get a break, right?
[23:48.07]I broke my hand.
[23:48.75]I was trying to do like a fucking she's cheating on me thing.
[23:51.23]Alright, get rid of it.
[23:53.94]Hold on.
[23:54.30]Let me just really quickly fix that.
[24:04.50]My arm really is broken.
[24:06.50]Alright, let's go here and knock on it.
[24:07.63]Who wants to play chess, huh?
[24:14.33]Hello?
[24:17.57]Wait, what?
[24:17.87]No, no, no.
[24:18.23]Like every other video game in history.
[24:20.31]I'm sick!
[24:21.55]I'm sick!
[24:21.95]You have to come in here!
[24:23.92]I don't feel well!
[24:24.72]You have to let me... I'm gonna throw up in my cell!
[24:27.92]Let me out of here so I can fucking take your key and strangle you unconscious!
[24:38.27]That didn't hurt.
[24:40.34]I'm pretending that that just hurt me.
[24:45.14]I guess I'll go to bed.
[24:48.82]Yeah, that was my fill up the bed meter.
[24:50.86]Sit down.
[24:51.28]Hey, did you find a piece of paper with my notes scribbled on it?
[25:08.36]Where's my little sloppiness?
[25:12.73]Oh, I didn't look at the back.
[25:14.01]Oops.
[25:14.57]Did you read my notes?
[25:15.85]Yes.
[25:16.73]Absolutely.
[25:18.11]You're quite the poet.
[25:21.89]You really shouldn't have.
[25:24.22]I guess you were just killing time, but curiosity killed the cat.
[25:28.76]Oh, you're going to kill me?
[25:29.40]Is that what you're saying?
[25:30.06]Let me up and let me fucking go like this.
[25:32.27]Let's get you ready for bed.
[25:33.97]Lights out soon.
[25:34.89]Ready for bed?
[25:36.17]It's like fucking 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
[25:37.75]What am I, 9?
[25:39.81]Oh, fuck.
[25:40.13]I might be 9.
[25:41.85]I might be 9.
[25:42.31]Okay.
[25:44.27]Alright.
[25:45.27]Lights out.
[25:46.74]These straps seem to be a little better.
[25:56.22]Here we go.
[26:07.88]Fuck you.
[26:09.02]Fuck you.
[26:09.60]That was not cool.
[26:10.92]I was going to do a Frankenstein joke.
[26:13.26]Like, ooh, it's me, Frankenstein.
[26:18.24]It took him fucking like 30 minutes to do that.
[26:21.02]And look, it's Lily Potter.
[26:25.02]Let's go.
[26:27.38]Lead me to the right way, Lily Potter.
[26:30.61]Hey, bud.
[26:31.83]Just follow me.
[26:32.77]Come along.
[26:33.43]Okay.
[26:33.95]Hi.
[26:38.78]Good ass game.
[26:40.40]Took you fucking long enough.
[26:43.10]Oh, I'm gonna break something in this room.
[26:44.44]I already know it.
[26:45.02]Okay, I gotta get ready.
[26:45.68]It's like drive the car.
[26:50.03]Okay.
[27:13.50]I just gave myself a migraine, like a big migraine.
[27:16.33]Wait, a sandwich!
[27:23.03]Who's that?
[27:27.96]It's Johnny Knoxville.
[27:29.24]Well, this is a very good opportunity for you to learn to get along with other people.
[27:33.34]You might want to start by introducing yourself.
[27:35.86]That's my sandwich.
[27:36.52]Let me see that sandwich.
[27:44.01]You should know we are very encouraged.
[27:46.67]You're on the road to a complete recovery.
[27:49.21]Someone's getting shot over there.
[27:51.55]How are you?
[27:54.03]Of course, there are always going to be patients that are beyond our help.
[27:57.73]But I know that you only want to get better.
[28:01.17]Maybe you should meet your new roommate.
[28:02.87]That's what I'm trying to do.
[28:03.63]Hey.
[28:05.81]Hey.
[28:07.41]He's going to be right in my face.
[28:10.63]Don't do it.
[28:11.01]Okay.
[28:12.81]Let's meet him.
[28:16.35]You.
[28:19.67]Okay, well... It's me.
[28:20.91]Stuck in here together, we might as well get to know each other.
[28:23.35]That's what I was thinking.
[28:24.79]What brings you to this fine establishment?
[28:27.05]Well, you see... I have amnesia.
[28:36.61]Funny thing about amnesia.
[28:38.15]That's what you got me in here for, too.
[28:39.91]Oh, God.
[28:40.83]Crazy thing is, I don't have amnesia.
[28:43.63]Why is it so dark in here?
[28:44.58]Everything is clear as a bell.
[28:46.82]Doesn't stop them from messing with my noggin.
[28:49.00]So, these treatments, ever get any easier?
[28:56.03]Let's take a moment.
[29:00.99]Let me do my fucking joke, now!
[29:03.83]Right here, come on.
[29:04.79]Hold that thought.
[29:06.37]What do you say?
[29:09.63]I hope so!
[29:10.95]Hope you're on the level.
[29:14.09]Name's Gordon.
[29:15.29]You?
[29:20.55]I don't know.
[29:23.27]I don't know.
[29:23.87]What are you doing here?
[29:24.73]What are we doing here?
[29:26.81]You see, the thing is... Fuck it.
[29:31.83]I don't know.
[29:32.55]What are we doing here?
[29:33.37]I don't know.
[29:34.15]Press the button.
[29:36.17]I, uh... I guess the pain don't let up.
[29:44.89]I'm like right swiping this guy.
[29:47.60]Ah, next.
[29:48.06]I don't fucking know.
[29:49.18]This guy's just not attractive enough for me.
[29:52.92]Sandwich.
[29:53.34]Perfect.
[29:57.17]Let's go give it to this guy.
[30:05.03]Pick up the sandwich and turn.
[30:06.77]I want to like turn and give the sandwich to this guy.
[30:16.64]Alright, we're going for the fucking special move.
[30:22.52]What?
[30:22.84]What?
[30:23.04]No.
[30:42.98]It won't let me touch the sandwich anymore.
[30:52.53]I can't eat it anymore.
[30:53.62]I was trying to drop it in the air into my mouth.
[30:57.04]Anything else I can do?
[30:59.12]Oh, there's a note over there.
[31:00.36]It's over there.
[31:05.27]That way.
[31:16.52]I'm ready.
[31:16.94]Look at me, I'm like, oh shit, I can't make it.
[31:20.79]It might be.
[31:21.39]Go to bed.
[31:22.75]Can I punch, let me just make sure I can.
[31:24.53]Yeah, I can.
[31:25.09]I think eventually I'll be able to do that to somebody.
[31:53.93]Time for more nightmares.
[31:56.01]I can't wait.
[31:59.57]It's too loud.
[32:00.45]I can see it's too loud.
[32:01.45]Hey, buddy.
[32:11.47]You alright?
[32:12.53]You were shaking the sheets a little last night.
[32:19.23]Well, I mean, how was it for you?
[32:22.17]Come on.
[32:22.69]Give me some papers and credit.
[32:24.02]I'm fine.
[32:24.42]Are you okay?
[32:29.48]Look, about before, I don't want you to get the wrong idea.
[32:33.02]Like, we're in a relationship.
[32:35.56]I don't know what they're doing to me, but it's just, I haven't been myself.
[32:40.57]I think it's... What's going on?
[32:50.71]Why do I have to pretend we don't know each other?
[32:53.37]We're clearly in a very, very loving relationship at this point.
[32:57.90]Another peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
[33:01.14]You're not a prisoner.
[33:03.04]Try taking it to your case personally.
[33:05.20]For now, I get comfortable.
[33:11.34]I love how there was just like, it's like 40 minutes of just hanging out in a room and getting pushed in a wheelchair.
[33:17.39]And then like a guy jumped in my face and screamed.
[33:21.65]She's okay, I guess.
[33:24.89]I don't know much about her.
[33:26.27]She's just the nurse or something.
[33:27.81]What you got against her, buddy?
[33:29.75]Nothing.
[33:33.45]Yeah.
[33:34.82]Another peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
[33:39.50]I see someone was hungry.
[33:41.32]Very, very good.
[33:42.58]Probably poisoning the food.
[33:44.54]I already know the ending of this movie.
[33:50.53]Just get up and fucking sprint!
[33:53.13]I could have got out.
[33:54.47]I would have just, like, jolted into action and got out the door.
[34:00.35]Quick, quick, quick, quick, come on, come on, come on, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[34:04.41]Damn it!
[34:04.87]I was trying to get his sandwich.
[34:07.76]Yeah.
[34:08.76]Can't believe it.
[34:09.38]Uh, yeah, yeah, screw that nonsense.
[34:12.80]Unbelievable.
[34:13.68]Uh...
[34:21.67]Maybe this is as soon as possible.
[34:26.29]As soon as possible, we're going to get out of here.
[34:30.03]I'm shocked.
[34:31.09]You'd give up this five-star cuisine?
[34:33.09]Yeah, yeah, just... My memory is improving.
[34:41.71]Just let me... It's all coming back, huh?
[34:44.85]Yeah, yeah, it is.
[34:48.68]No, tell me how you got here.
[34:52.17]Are you going to finish your sandwich?
[34:53.93]Let's go eat.
[35:25.70]Ha ha!
[35:26.06]Sandwich!
[35:27.78]My old nemesis.
[35:35.60]What are you saying?
[35:37.70]What are you saying over there, Archvillain?
[35:43.78]Why are you only allowed to take one bite of the sandwich?
[35:47.52]Oh.
[35:52.81]I wish I could take more than one bite.
[35:56.46]Do I have to hold it here the whole time?
[36:02.31]Oh, yes.
[36:04.19]It's so delicious.
[36:07.57]I'm going to bed again.
[36:09.19]This is a great game.
[36:18.18]Good night.
[36:20.32]I am the crazy one, right?
[36:21.98]Like, this guy's looking at me like, oh, shit, this guy deserves to be here.
[36:24.70]You know what I mean?
[36:25.32]Like, I very much absolutely should be here.
[36:32.24]And in case this guy had any doubt, he's like, holy shit, man, I'm going to get out of here.
[36:36.18]But this guy, this guy fucking belongs here.
[36:47.31]Whoa.
[36:47.93]When the hell am I getting out of here?
[36:49.69]I'm sorry, I don't... You told me you had an answer.
[36:53.27]Black wants you here.
[36:54.75]Just a little bit longer.
[36:58.45]You tell Bragg that I'm done.
[37:00.29]I voluntarily choose to leave.
[37:02.07]Why is that in Etalyx?
[37:04.98]I'll let him know.
[37:08.70]I mean, I'll take that sandwich.
[37:10.38]You know what I'm saying?
[37:13.16]I don't trust anyone in this damn snake pit.
[37:15.10]No, he can't.
[37:15.82]Right?
[37:17.00]You don't trust a word they say either, do you?
[37:23.30]What's your problem?
[37:27.41]You're gonna eat that sandwich?
[37:40.28]Uh oh, code red!
[37:43.02]She's gonna leave the door unlocked.
[37:44.72]Here we go.
[38:01.90]Another patient on the loose.
[38:04.67]Cue the three rings, sir.
[38:07.37]Not like it doesn't happen once a week around here.
[38:09.35]Hello.
[38:11.03]Doped and drooling in no time.
[38:14.69]I can't.
[38:15.09]You can't do anything.
[38:15.75]Might as well just eat the fucking sandwich.
[38:21.51]Turn over this way.
[38:22.16]I'm going to enjoy my coffee for a second.
[38:27.52]You and I, we're not like the rest of the folks in here.
[38:30.82]You get that, right?
[38:33.85]There's nothing in here.
[38:37.11]Why am I drinking this?
[38:43.31]See, what I like to do is I like to dip my sandwich inside the ah-shoe.
[38:48.43]Inside that nice ah-shoe.
[38:50.53]Here we are.
[38:55.51]It's so good.
[38:56.95]Dip it in that ah-shoe.
[39:02.70]That didn't sound human.
[39:10.97]That didn't sound fucking human.
[39:17.74]Alright, let's go.
[39:23.22]Time for bed.
[39:29.96]Okay, here we go, another fucking jump scare.
[39:32.22]Be ready for this one, here it comes.
[39:41.05]Don't do it.
[39:44.80]Just don't do it.
[39:45.56]He's going to get right in my face.
[39:48.40]Right this way.
[40:01.25]I hear a guy.
[40:01.85]He's going to be right in my face.
[40:05.37]Okay, all I know is I got to use comedy here until I get myself over this.
[40:12.48]Here we go.
[40:14.04]Just gotta use comedy.
[40:14.97]That's how you solve every fucking problem.
[40:24.57]Goddamn.
[40:32.40]That was so loud.
[40:36.37]I would have had the same reaction.
[40:37.95]If you came in here and just dropped like a firecracker in my room, the same thing would happen.
[40:41.75]There he comes.
[40:42.99]He's gonna turn and he's gonna have that face.
[40:45.51]Everybody knows what it is.
[40:46.31]Everybody knows what it is.
[41:19.03]Okay, I'm not doing that anymore.
[41:21.17]Oh, I gotta like come out for air for a second.
[41:22.89]Uh-uh.
[41:26.91]God damn it, I got sweat on this thing.
[41:29.41]Um... Maybe, maybe not.
[41:51.64]I don't know.
[41:52.82]I'm not your mother.
[41:53.74]No, I'm sure they'll be back.
[41:55.40]Whatever's happened, they can handle it.
[41:57.40]There's a backup plan for everything.
[41:59.98]Believe me.
[42:01.46]Believe me.
[42:03.04]Jesus, you look like you're right on the edge.
[42:05.12]I don't know about you, but I'm famished.
[42:09.63]I'm sure there's still some food around here.
[42:11.95]Any little scrap will do.
[42:13.31]Well, you threw your sandwich down here.
[42:14.99]I know where the food is.
[42:16.51]I know where it is.
[42:17.65]You threw it down here like an idiot.
[42:20.19]It's right here.
[42:22.59]It's like an old rotten sandwich.
[42:26.21]You going under the bed for food, man?
[42:28.11]Really?
[42:28.33]Are you kidding me?
[42:35.44]It's right there.
[42:36.82]What is it?
[42:37.68]You still got it.
[42:38.56]Is it a sandwich?
[42:40.56]It's an egg.
[42:42.64]They never gave us eggs.
[42:51.62]Nice, that's like half a hard-boiled egg.
[43:02.08]My turn.
[43:04.06]Hey!
[43:05.22]Hey!
[43:07.17]Are you kidding me?
[43:09.01]You have no idea how hungry I am.
[43:12.79]What about me?
[43:13.61]I've been in the same room.
[43:14.91]Stance's stale bread could taste like caviar.
[43:17.07]No, it's bread.
[43:18.45]Don't you worry.
[43:19.45]Bragg will have his whole mess sorted before you know it.
[43:23.46]He had nothing but stale bread.
[43:33.51]So how is this a prequel to Until Dawn?
[43:35.65]That's what I don't understand.
[43:39.84]I can't go to sleep yet.
[43:40.74]No.
[43:46.92]I guess we have to just look out here.
[43:51.02]In the extremely bright.
[43:53.95]Are they getting arrested?
[44:01.63]Who is it?
[44:03.63]Did you see that?
[44:14.04]Not what the hell do I do?
[44:15.52]Nothing else to do.
[44:18.14]I have no many things that are blinking to touch.
[44:20.36]No, apparently I do have to touch it again.
[44:24.60]Show me the light.
[44:26.44]Show me again.
[44:26.98]Hey, hey!
[44:28.90]Get off of me!
[44:33.95]I can't push it.
[44:36.73]Why are you doing this to me?
[44:40.77]Ah!
[44:41.39]Hey!
[44:52.83]I'm crazy.
[44:53.35]Do I have to do that again?
[45:03.48]What am I missing here?
[45:07.00]What?
[45:09.59]I don't get it.
[45:12.33]Can I like leave the room?
[45:13.65]Anything different in this room?
[45:24.66]Alright, I'm gonna start the cutscene, and then I'm gonna turn around.
[45:32.38]What else is here?
[45:33.02]What's here?
[45:34.38]There's nothing here!
[45:44.92]What's going on here?
[45:49.66]Grab the coffee?
[45:52.65]Why are you doing this to me?
[46:00.49]Up there?
[46:01.68]You want me to grab this coffee?
[46:03.52]Can I talk to him?
[46:04.70]Yes.
[46:05.38]What is it?
[46:11.76]Why would they leave me here?
[46:16.21]I'm just going to click them.
[46:17.49]You just got to be patient.
[46:21.45]Get it?
[46:22.57]Be patient.
[46:23.11]I want to see at least 25 LULs in the chat for that one.
[46:26.92]You okay?
[46:27.86]No, I can't see.
[46:31.05]I've had some strange... No, I said I was going to just press the button.
[46:35.08]Yeah, I... Me too, actually.
[46:39.12]Ever since they put me in... Listen, this is going to be fine.
[46:47.60]Trust me.
[46:49.28]Just hang in there.
[46:50.48]I believe you.
[46:51.52]I'm bushed.
[46:52.72]Why don't we both get some rest?
[46:55.22]Sweet dreams.
[46:56.30]Good night.
[46:57.85]I mean...
[46:59.24]What do you mean that, huh?
[47:00.67]Are you infiltrating my mind?
[47:01.81]Hey!
[47:09.59]Freedom?
[47:10.29]Come here, goddammit!
[47:11.48]You sniveling sons of bitches!
[47:12.84]Help!
[47:13.80]You can't just leave me in here!
[47:15.46]You can't do this to me!
[47:16.64]Help us!
[47:17.08]Let me do that too!
[47:19.57]See?
[47:19.91]I did that.
[47:20.25]I was way weaker than you, and you were so much colder than me.
[47:24.18]My belly is so big.
[47:28.36]Oh, my belly is larger than life.
[47:31.18]What happened?
[47:32.62]Okay, Mac, when you're editing this video, you've got to, like, add, like, water sloshing sound effects.
[47:41.44]Like, oh, come on.
[47:43.16]You've got to add, like... Why did the volume just turn off?
[47:51.20]Easy.
[47:52.92]Easy!
[47:53.26]I've, uh... I've almost got a brick for you.
[48:02.88]With this spoon!
[48:04.62]Pretty good, right?
[48:05.70]Let me try.
[48:08.71]Great idea!
[48:11.51]Can I do it?
[48:12.11]Yeah.
[48:13.43]It is a great idea.
[48:14.17]What is it?
[48:14.49]I want to help, too.
[48:14.99]What is the tool for me?
[48:15.71]Let me use the tray.
[48:18.37]Come on!
[48:19.69]No, you idiot!
[48:21.04]That was our only chance.
[48:22.38]I didn't do anything.
[48:27.62]What, because I was standing behind him?
[48:29.38]Are you one of those guys that doesn't like when people stand behind you when you work?
[48:32.28]You need to calm down.
[48:35.32]You need to calm down.
[48:38.62]They had to get a little... Are you kidding?
[48:41.48]What the hell is wrong with you?
[48:42.76]Are you trying to get us killed?
[48:45.40]What the hell?
[48:53.45]I got a light now.
[48:55.64]Oh, dear.
[48:56.16]I'm on fucking detail duty.
[48:57.98]I hate working at a museum.
[49:00.96]I got this job from Ben Stiller.
[49:11.12]Okay.
[49:12.54]Yeah, you watch out there.
[49:25.29]Why is my arm extending?
[49:27.17]I'm like Mr. Fantastic.
[49:30.24]Okay, just go ahead and through these.
[49:34.44]That would be nice if you would go through the door.
[49:36.86]I'm in.
[49:37.30]I'm in.
[49:38.62]You have finally arrived.
[49:42.50]Is this the guy from the first game?
[49:44.14]The guy that's in everything?
[49:46.80]Peter Krampus, right?
[49:48.72]Peter Krampus?
[49:50.50]He's in like everything.
[50:00.44]I want to switch hands.
[50:01.22]How do I switch hands?
[50:03.22]Here we go.
[50:05.88]I'm much better with my right hand.
[50:11.10]Okay.
[50:13.96]What's in it for me?
[50:15.42]You know?
[50:24.84]Where's my, uh, where's my, like, $41 for being the experiment like you get when you do an experiment for, like, BU?
[50:34.79]Where's my $40?
[50:37.47]I'd like it.
[50:45.06]Something, it's gonna, like, they're gonna appear and this guy's gonna be in the chair.
[50:49.08]I already know it.
[50:51.60]Here it comes, here comes like the fucking guitar amplifier, distortion, and then like the room's gonna flash and there's gonna be a firecracker in my room.
[50:58.72]Three, two, one, action.
[51:04.44]Not quite, next room, right here.
[51:07.94]Is that my friend?
[51:09.34]Oh shit, it's the Joker.
[51:19.28]Yeah, so Batman.
[51:23.50]Oh, god damn it.
[51:25.88]Is he alive?
[51:34.07]I command you to live!
[51:36.07]I gotta get it right in the face.
[51:43.48]Charge of power.
[51:44.22]One, two, three.
[51:47.48]I tried.
[51:48.77]This way?
[51:49.13]Is this way blocked?
[51:56.74]What a fucking atmosphere, you know what I mean?
[51:59.78]This game's full of atmosphere.
[52:09.14]These doors probably don't even open.
[52:15.99]Do they?
[52:16.35]They might.
[52:26.13]Nobody there.
[52:28.43]Okay, back into the mist.
[52:31.94]Is there a sprint?
[52:33.18]No.
[52:40.40]Well, what am I supposed to do?
[52:41.28]Does he have, like, an item on him?
[52:46.03]No, you got nothing on you.
[52:47.19]It's gonna go down here.
[52:49.15]This dude's gonna stand up.
[52:51.99]And he's gonna be like, Why did you do it?
[52:55.23]Why did you kill me?
[52:57.27]No, this is dead end.
[53:16.28]The eagle comes flying in from the right side.
[53:19.42]Isn't that funny, kids?
[53:21.08]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[53:24.92]No, I can't, hold on.
[53:28.70]I wish I could put my both hands together.
[53:35.86]The whale!
[53:36.74]That's not a whale, fuck it.
[53:43.88]So what the hell's going on here?
[53:48.44]Go through the radiator?
[53:51.86]Maybe this is a different door?
[53:58.10]I gotta rip the radiator off the hinges.
[54:01.95]This guy can't be interacted with, right?
[54:10.52]who just picked him up that's just me hitting the wall okay um I don't why are those doors not open did I something up was there anything else in this room like filing cabinets there's nothing in here
[54:39.72]Alright, before I go all the way back, am I like fucking stupid?
[54:44.35]Am I a moron?
[54:52.11]Bald.
[54:57.57]He's... Turn it up.
[55:00.41]Turn it up!
[55:04.19]The game's like really fucking loud.

[55:19.03]Wait, go to the right of the Joker.
[55:20.27]Okay, I'm going to go to the right of the Joker.
[55:26.91]And here we go.
[55:31.21]So I was just here.
[55:32.45]What are you talking about?
[55:33.33]What are you guys on about?
[55:35.37]I was just over here.
[55:40.02]I couldn't open this door.
[55:41.11]I can't open this door.
[55:47.97]Watch.
[55:49.21]Oh, Jesus.
[55:56.92]Switch this.
[55:59.13]Switch this hand.
[56:11.56]I can't get into this door.
[56:14.27]Why did somebody tell me to go to the right of the Joker?
[56:19.17]That's where you started?
[56:20.69]What?
[56:21.93]Is it really?
[56:22.51]Am I that fucking dumb?
[56:24.53]How did I not?
[56:25.19]It's VR.
[56:25.87]It's like I'm in the VR helmet.
[56:27.41]It's hard to tell what the fuck's going on.
[56:28.89]I didn't start here.
[56:32.41]You think I started here?
[56:33.35]I didn't do something good, therefore I didn't have to do it for free.
[56:42.23]Fuck you.
[56:44.87]Hey, how's this one for fucking voice activation?
[56:46.65]Light on!
[56:47.91]Light off!
[56:49.36]See?
[56:50.78]Think I can't fucking control this game.
[56:52.96]I went, I turned around?
[56:54.14]How?
[57:00.20]So, what happened?
[57:06.33]Go that way.
[57:07.59]Go this way.
[57:09.91]It's just like an infinite comedy when you're in virtual reality.
[57:21.58]Dog?
[57:21.84]Alright, I see a dog.
[57:24.50]Whose, uh, whose Horcrux is that?
[57:26.90]Whose Patronus is that?
[57:30.16]Dog Patronus.
[57:30.84]Alright, I'm ready for the jumpscare that's about to be right in my face.
[57:37.44]That easy?
[57:40.65]Stay?
[57:41.81]Stay?
[57:44.55]Oh, you lost a shoe.
[57:45.51]That's all that happened.
[57:50.70]They faked me out.
[57:54.16]Did you see a cat?
[58:08.31]I'm more confident with my right hand.
[58:09.55]I'd like to bash him, but he's like fucking sculling.
[58:22.11]I pretty much have like a fucking World War II mirror.
[58:39.50]Something's right behind me over here.
[58:41.38]Fucking video games.
[59:06.26]Another dead guy.
[59:07.10]Alright.
[59:07.54]Same thing.
[59:07.92]Peek the corner.
[59:27.14]Where's the dog?
[59:27.84]I was so scared to turn around.
[59:31.66]Oh, it was that.
[59:37.85]Alright, I'm just gonna hug the wall.
[59:44.21]Turn the light off and hug the wall.
[59:50.33]Let's just sneak by the dog.
[59:56.82]Stay on the wall.
[60:10.63]Stay on the wall.
[60:11.47]Stay on the wall.
[60:23.66]He's fucking angry.
[60:24.84]I understand how angry the dog is.
[60:30.49]I can't move.
[60:31.11]Why would this matter?
[60:32.91]I don't even know where he is.
[60:45.30]Where is he?
[60:55.78]Are you sure this isn't Frank Welker doing funny voices again?
[60:59.68]He's really good at animals.
[61:05.43]Remember, if you're scared, just do comedy.
[61:08.31]And you won't be scared anymore.
[61:09.87]Here we go.
[61:27.01]See, not even scared.
[61:29.19]Who's in here?
[61:32.56]Who's in the door?
[61:36.44]Turn around.
[61:39.12]Hello?
[61:40.64]Dog?
[61:59.52]Where's my body?
[62:03.92]Wait, where am I?
[62:05.30]Where am I?
[62:06.12]In the room, for real.
[62:12.31]I think I've gotten stuck in the door.
[62:14.71]I've got to get out of here.
[62:17.87]Somebody's got me.
[62:18.73]The spirit.
[62:19.91]The spirit's hauling me in.
[62:21.73]I can't fight him.
[62:23.03]I can't fight the spirit anymore.
[62:36.89]Go this way.
[62:38.03]Sit down.
[62:39.15]Down.
[62:42.01]Fly away.
[62:46.31]I don't know what to do here.
[62:47.11]I really am like fucked.
[62:52.47]I gotta get higher.
[62:54.36]I gotta get a little higher.
[62:56.30]Just don't fall down.
[63:02.78]There we go.
[63:03.10]I just have to get higher.
[63:04.24]If I gotta get a little bit higher,
[63:08.47]There you go, am I going in?
[63:16.76]This is what we call dangerous.
[63:20.42]Just fucking float.
[63:23.78]I'm breaking this guy's back in half.
[63:27.83]Just get in there.
[63:32.23]Just activate the jump scare, quick.
[63:34.45]It's in the room, right?
[63:35.23]Where?
[63:35.51]Where in the room is it?
[63:36.51]Where's the dog's eyes?
[63:40.27]There's the door handle.
[63:41.39]Okay.
[63:42.05]Dog's eyes.
[63:44.19]You see, I think the dog's eyes are right there.
[63:46.89]Just activate the jump scare and I get up.
[63:49.37]Switch hands.
[63:51.37]Switch hands.
[63:54.01]There we go.
[63:54.33]Got it.
[63:54.71]Okay.
[63:55.15]Just got to reach over there with my fucked up body.
[63:57.83]Where's the door?
[63:59.63]Almost there.
[64:00.91]Almost there.
[64:01.99]Oh, God damn it.
[64:03.04]There's a wall on the way.
[64:04.02]A real wall.
[64:05.54]There's a real wall on the fucking way.
[64:13.08]So close, but so far.
[64:15.86]Oh, shit.
[64:25.41]Get it.
[64:26.37]Am I in?
[64:27.71]Fuck, I don't even know.
[64:34.93]My body is, like, in the wall here.
[64:54.19]How did I do this?
[64:55.95]I don't understand.
[64:58.74]Why?
[64:59.84]God, why?
[65:00.78]What?
[65:03.10]Holy shit, okay, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, calm down, calm down, calm down.
[65:07.49]Calm down, stop moving.
[65:14.49]Alright, I did it, I made it.
[65:24.86]Damn it.
[65:29.46]I made it.
[65:30.08]I finally made it.
[65:49.28]Oh, my hair.
[65:50.76]Oh, give me like a hair timeout.
[65:52.96]I can't put these down.
[65:54.10]I'm like, put these on the table.
[65:56.28]Hair timeout.
[65:56.88]Hold on.
[65:57.24]This is, oh boy, oh boy.
[66:00.04]Mom, you are not going to be happy about this.
[66:03.90]Mom is going to kill me.
[66:06.44]Oh, mom, you are not going to be okay with what my hair looks like from now on, mom.
[66:12.82]I know you told me to stay away from drugs, stay away from strangers, but you didn't tell me to stay away from the PSVR, and now I'm bald in the front of my head.
[66:22.41]What's going on?
[66:22.79]Oh, okay, we're good.
[66:31.11]Alright, let's go.
[66:33.53]No, don't come in here.
[66:35.81]It hurts.
[66:36.25]It's me!
[66:36.63]Alright.
[66:42.38]There's no comedy right now.
[66:43.32]Let's just talk.
[66:44.50]No.
[66:45.22]How are you?
[66:45.90]Not me.
[66:46.46]Pat him.
[66:47.78]I'm worthless.
[66:49.92]You ever notice that when somebody comes in a room and they really want to talk to you about something, they're very serious about their topic, they do one of these.
[67:01.55]It's no excuse, but I just want you to understand.
[67:04.39]Like your dad comes in the room and he's like... He walks in, he's just like... You know, you've got like a D-minus in fucking math and he's just like...
[67:18.38]So, let's talk about this.
[67:21.98]It's a bit late for that, don't you think?
[67:23.16]So is this helmet.
[67:27.36]This is so... Is my heater turned up to like 100?
[67:31.53]Why is it so hot in here?
[67:33.81]I need to like open the window.
[67:37.07]I'm salivating right now.
[67:49.77]Oh, I dropped!
[67:52.20]Ha!
[67:52.26]You didn't think I fucking had these on, did you?
[67:54.52]We gotta hold on.
[67:55.08]What a lame fucking feature, seriously.
[67:56.06]Me.
[68:20.56]I lay awake.
[68:23.33]I can't stop thinking about it.
[68:26.43]Hey, you.
[68:29.19]One little cave in and... 30 men.
[68:36.08]Oh, with miners, with the miners from the first game.
[68:38.78]Down in that mine.
[68:40.32]Only 12, by the way, made it.
[68:42.30]How's that even possible?
[68:45.78]Only 12 made it out.
[68:48.53]Out of the frying pan.
[68:52.51]and then leave it to Bragg to hear Opportunity knock and know how to cover his ass.
[68:59.44]Well, this doesn't seem like it should be a thing, does it?
[69:01.72]You never really have to think about what you might be capable of.
[69:03.98]Hey, did I tell you I was quadruple jointed?
[69:05.98]Yeah, I didn't mind.
[69:06.63]I'm stuck in a cell.
[69:16.70]You know that guy that was always at the cafeteria that used to do this?
[69:20.32]Hold on, see if I can do it.
[69:22.00]This is important.
[69:22.72]I don't fucking care what he says.
[69:23.84]This is who cares about this game.
[69:26.83]I want to do the thing that like the kid does at the lunch table and thinks he's like fucking awesome.
[69:31.43]This thing, ready?
[69:36.03]Whoa!
[69:37.65]Are you serious, Tim?
[69:38.79]You can do that shit?
[69:40.01]You'll triple join in?
[69:41.96]Yeah.
[69:43.36]Can I have some of your fries?
[69:46.48]Hey, down in a mine, huh?
[69:48.92]That's a good question.
[69:58.04]And what's the point of hiding it now?
[70:01.87]Come on, you know he's going to put it in.
[70:03.41]When you see this video that, like, Holy Mac makes, he's going to add a bunch of, like, sloshes, and it's going to be wicked.
[70:09.53]What the hell was that?
[70:12.17]Wait.
[70:13.31]Grab him.
[70:13.67]Grab him.
[70:14.61]Grab his pulp.
[70:19.23]Monsters.
[70:24.83]Wait, hold on.
[70:25.75]Wait a second.
[70:26.15]Hold on a minute.
[70:27.39]I've got to impress these aliens.
[70:33.87]Did you think it was cool?
[70:35.13]Did you think it was cool?
[70:37.56]Say wait, you don't think it's cool?
[70:39.76]Come on.
[70:53.93]His ultimate power!
[70:55.03]Alright, I'm gonna open the door, obviously.
[71:00.95]Get away from the door.
[71:02.47]I'm like on edge tonight.
[71:07.81]So you gotta get out.
[71:08.72]I'm a little scared.
[71:09.52]This guy jumps around.
[71:10.42]Look at this streamer that makes a lot of fucking noise when a monster comes in.
[71:13.62]He's got like a facecam on and he screams.
[71:16.38]It's time to eat.
[71:17.02]I saved one.
[71:18.40]Just for you.
[71:23.13]Okay, thanks.
[71:27.45]How do I, I wanna eat this.
[71:28.37]This is gonna be gross.
[71:30.09]Come on.
[71:31.71]This should have been like a big mouth should have appeared like right in front of the screen here and like teeth grabbing it.
[71:39.77]Like old Ren and Stimpy cartoon.
[71:46.03]We're just resorting to eating bugs and shit.
[71:47.69]This is, this is desperate.
[71:49.53]Why can't we just break the window?
[71:51.80]Break the window, the window's already broken.
[71:53.30]I got an idea.
[71:56.13]And then run!
[71:56.91]You tell me we can't break this.
[71:58.41]Where'd my arm go?
[72:00.11]I'm not stuck in the fucking wall again.
[72:03.49]Oh, again.
[72:22.98]Not again, please pull me out.
[72:27.09]I can't, it's happening again.
[72:29.97]I can't get up.
[72:30.65]Why am I doing this?
[72:43.94]I didn't want it to happen.
[72:53.97]Yeah, you didn't want this to happen?
[72:55.69]Okay.
[72:55.93]It is my fault.
[72:56.77]Yeah, it is.
[72:57.49]I think it is, too.
[73:02.30]Forgive me?
[73:03.20]Okay, sure thing.
[73:05.54]I forgive you.
[73:08.12]If you could point me to the nearest chiropractor.
[73:11.10]Could you, like, bend me back and snap my back around?
[73:14.78]Why should I?
[73:15.38]I hope he punches me in the face.
[73:17.44]Please punch me in the face.
[73:19.14]Yes.
[73:20.18]Oh, my God.
[73:20.54]Please punch me in the face.
[73:23.27]Somebody break in here and just attack us.

[73:53.51]You might change or you might die.
[73:57.71]Yeah.
[74:02.83]That's... You know what I'm doing?
[74:04.46]I'm doing Eddie from Ed, Edd n Eddy.
[74:07.06]You know what I mean?
[74:08.28]When he's running like this.
[74:10.74]Play the fucking Ed, Edd n Eddy theme song.
[74:21.54]Okay, that's enough.
[74:24.38]Wait, am I back?
[74:25.56]No.
[74:29.74]For a second, I thought that was my mouth.

[76:46.71]Okay, wait, maybe I can... Fix it.
[76:52.63]I fixed it.

[77:42.21]Give them a control.
[77:43.03]The door's not going to stay shut anymore.
[77:45.55]Bugs and aliens and monsters.
[77:47.45]Remember when he syringed me in the very beginning of the game?
[77:50.77]This is a side effect of being syringed.
[77:53.05]Guaranteed.
[77:55.19]I guarantee it.
[78:01.74]Bang, bang, bang.

[78:32.52]The alien is inside.
[78:34.46]Okay.
[78:35.27]Ah, Sue!
[78:49.69]That's what I wanted.

[79:07.86]No!
[79:08.16]I wanted to bring that.
[79:17.82]Oh, the whole thing is ruined.
[79:19.42]Can I bring the chess board?
[79:21.84]Come on.
[79:25.16]This spider's on here.
[79:26.86]Oh.
[79:30.65]I got one.
[79:34.29]Damn it.
[79:38.93]I'm so, wait.
[79:43.33]Perfect.
[79:45.07]Don't drop this for the rest of the game.
[79:48.25]Unless I want to first beat into somebody's teeth.
[79:51.07]Don't drop this.
[79:51.79]I have to hold onto this.
[79:52.61]This is the gnome from Left 4 Dead.
[79:54.02]I have to hold onto this the whole time.
[79:55.94]I have to hold the trigger down.
[79:57.06]If I let go of the trigger, it drops.
[79:59.38]Gnome challenge.
[80:19.39]I played Ultimate Frisbee in college, you don't think I fucking know how to use this?
[80:29.94]No challenges going well so far.
[80:34.16]Grenade.
[80:42.76]Alright, I gotta put the CD in the CD player.
[80:45.68]There we go.
[80:58.20]Why are we upside down?
[81:03.80]No!
[81:04.70]Wait, I need gravity back.
[81:05.80]I gotta catch this.
[81:08.36]How do I get the gravity back?
[81:11.40]God damn it!
[81:13.30]Hold on.
[81:15.28]I gotta turn the gravity back on and I gotta catch this plate.
[81:18.66]Here we go.
[81:19.12]You ready?
[81:23.84]I think I'm in a good spot.
[81:24.53]Here we go.
[81:24.87]Gravity back on.
[81:31.37]Ravity.
[81:38.13]Okay, new gnome challenge.
[81:40.09]I got an actual gnome.
[81:46.74]I can't go.
[81:47.92]God damn it.
[81:57.64]Unbelievable.
[82:08.34]No!
[82:09.68]Why?
[82:10.74]Why are you doing this?
[82:11.94]Stop it!
[82:18.18]Somebody behind me.
[82:19.83]Is there a plate in here still?
[82:27.57]Damn it.
[82:35.51]I can't get it.
[82:37.08]Can I get the lamp?
[82:39.73]No.
[82:40.35]Lost it.
[82:42.97]Get some water in my face.
[82:43.99]This is a fucking nightmare.
[82:45.97]No, I just have to... We just gotta go.
[82:50.93]Alright.
[82:51.81]This is too loud!
[83:09.28]There's a huge spider in here somewhere.
[83:16.40]Okay, more importantly, forget about everything else.
[83:18.93]We gotta find another plate.
[83:25.93]New plate.
[83:29.91]Thank God our prayers have been answered.
[83:33.57]New plate challenge begins.
[83:35.45]Do not, do not drop this plate.
[83:42.33]Plate challenge initiated.
[83:45.61]Do not let go of right trigger.
[83:51.74]Here we go.
[83:53.62]I dropped it.
[83:54.04]No, I didn't.
[83:57.82]That would have been fucking funny.
[84:01.56]This is gonna be so hard.
[84:02.52]I'm gonna have to drop this to open a door.
[84:05.25]No, I won't.
[84:06.09]I said, well, no, I can put it down.
[84:08.77]I just can't, I just can't hit the ground.
[84:10.25]It's like when you play with a balloon when you're fucking eight years old.
[84:16.08]This is, my hand's getting so sweaty trying to do this.
[84:20.90]I can't, where the fuck am I?
[84:24.44]Where am I?
[84:27.88]Obviously we're not going, I need to switch this.
[84:30.75]I don't like this on this hand.
[84:33.29]Nope, sorry guys, I thought I was on the wall.
[84:35.85]Okay.
[84:37.06]I got a shield, at least.
[84:38.86]I can shield from the jump scares.
[84:42.16]Look, you can't get scared by something you can't see.
[84:48.11]Right?
[84:52.13]This is my baby shield.
[84:55.05]Because I'm a fucking baby.
[84:57.35]Anything in here of use doesn't look like it.
[85:06.57]That noise is going to get fucking annoying.
[85:08.39]Here we go.
[85:14.32]Now, I can't... If you tilt this thing back even remotely...
[85:39.45]It's just too dark.
[85:43.39]That can't be opened.
[85:44.07]Alright, here we go.
[85:45.69]Let's try shield in room number one.
[85:47.77]We got a shield here.
[85:49.39]Make sure we're lined up in the doorway.
[85:52.05]We are.
[85:52.86]Shield activated.
[86:00.44]Captain, so far, so good.
[86:02.90]There were no jump scares to shield from.
[86:04.66]Shield's at 100%.
[86:12.80]Radio.
[86:14.46]Mirror?
[86:14.76]Okay, radio.
[86:16.48]How do I turn on the radio?
[86:18.68]Okay, I just... Can I put this down?
[86:30.01]Back up.
[86:31.39]I have to put the plate down.
[86:32.13]We're going to set it very easily on this table.
[86:34.67]This is not denying the challenge.
[86:38.68]We can easily pick that right back up.
[86:42.13]I'm just going to turn on the radio.
[86:44.73]Turn it on and immediately grab plate.
[86:54.07]Got it.
[87:00.22]Get off the screen!
[87:02.62]I got too much stuff on the stream.
[87:06.90]I can't see a damn thing.
[87:09.19]Okay, second room.
[87:11.37]Shields activated!
[87:21.30]Clear.
[87:30.33]Okay, move this shit out of the way.
[87:37.21]I don't want this to fall down.
[87:38.15]We gotta clear this.
[87:41.06]Okay, right there.
[87:44.68]Let's open up the file.
[87:51.04]Steve, are you a fucking idiot?
[87:52.32]Do you not understand how to pick this up?
[87:54.04]Don't knock that off.
[87:56.40]How do you not understand how to do this?
[87:58.62]Just grab it.
[87:59.64]It's right here.
[88:00.34]Grab this.
[88:01.60]Oh my god, you fucking idiot.
[88:10.37]Ain't nothing on it.
[88:15.45]Shield!
[88:16.45]Damn it!
[88:26.50]Thank God the shield's still there.
[88:30.12]OK.
[88:35.40]That's it in here, right?
[88:38.76]I believe so.
[88:44.71]Here we go.
[88:46.31]Let's get the shield ready.
[88:49.03]Jeez.
[88:51.19]Almost dropped it.
[88:52.09]Almost dropped it.
[88:52.79]My hand's getting tired here.
[88:55.98]These controls are more to be desired, I will tell you.
[89:05.93]Elevator, press the L. I can't get this back if I put this down here.
[89:16.50]No, definitely not.
[89:17.22]Is there anything higher?
[89:17.96]Can I just... Kill two birds with one stone?
[89:30.66]Here we go.
[89:37.09]You can't get scared of what you can't see!
[89:53.70]Haha!
[89:57.62]Thank you!
[90:03.73]Beautiful.
[90:05.29]No, we gotta go down.
[90:12.42]Just sit in the corner.
[90:14.92]Where am I?
[90:15.34]What's going on?
[90:20.30]They took my fucking plate.
[90:21.56]Oh, you assholes.
[90:23.02]What?
[90:33.47]That's such bullshit.
[90:39.10]Okay.
[90:41.88]I admit it.
[90:43.32]That was a ballsy move, game.
[90:47.05]Pharmacy.
[90:49.15]Treatment.
[90:53.05]I can't pick that up.
[90:57.94]I need to like recalibrate this because I'm like fucked up right now.
[91:01.26]There we go.
[91:02.86]It's supposed to be walking forward.
[91:04.00]It's not walking forward.
[91:10.52]Well, this sure is scary.
[91:11.76]I'll tell you.
[91:15.74]Always lock doors.
[91:19.42]I can't like Hulk smash this.
[91:21.52]Somebody did.
[91:24.36]Somebody already did.
[91:32.57]Any plates?
[91:33.90]Anywhere?
[91:35.62]That I can be aware of?
[91:40.08]Here they come.
[91:40.58]Here come the doors.
[91:41.28]Go ahead and get it over with.
[91:42.20]Oh, I can use my hand.
[91:45.38]Well, who needs a fucking plate?
[91:50.08]That's so lame.
[91:51.77]Nobody wants to see that.
[91:57.17]Nobody wants to see the guy streaming this game blocking all the good parts.
[92:02.37]I didn't even think about that.
[92:04.79]What an unbearable stream that would be.
[92:07.39]Oh, hey guys, I'm playing a scary game right now, and yeah, you can't see anything.
[92:12.13]Really cool, huh?
[92:15.10]Donkey.
[92:22.46]Wait a minute.
[92:24.52]Wait just a second here.
[92:32.31]Oh, yes!
[92:41.54]Don't blow it.
[92:42.06]Come on.
[93:02.32]I just want the fucking... Just give it to me.
[93:10.71]No, no, no, no, no.
[93:13.79]I want the tea.
[93:18.07]Got it!
[93:19.15]Finally.
[93:19.82]Jesus.
[93:20.84]That took long enough.
[93:25.76]Where's my...
[93:35.79]Okay.
[93:37.71]I don't think I've blinked in like 30 minutes.
[93:44.58]I don't think I've blinked in 30 minutes.
[93:48.30]What are you thinking?
[93:49.10]Why did I do that?
[93:51.86]What are you thinking?
[93:55.75]I really don't think I've blinked in 30 minutes.
[94:00.81]My eyes are like watery.
[94:03.45]Watch this.
[94:03.87]Ready?
[94:07.14]Get up nice and close.
[94:12.04]Come on, I can smash this, right?
[94:13.52]You had to put this in the game.
[94:14.56]No, it's not gonna... Just get the fuck out of here.
[94:21.67]Where am I going?
[94:23.51]Go this way.
[94:24.11]Go straight.
[94:25.43]Ay-yi-yi.
[94:27.27]Over here.
[94:32.27]I gotta move?
[94:32.95]No, I don't.
[94:33.37]It's gonna go this way.
[94:35.41]Pliers?
[94:36.49]What is this?
[94:36.89]Some kind of electrocution device?
[94:39.41]Some kind of torture device?
[94:40.37]Turn it on.
[94:43.15]I guess I can't turn it on.
[94:44.01]I have to go in that room.
[94:53.57]Somebody's walking over here.
[94:55.83]I better make this quick before the dark- Dude, how dark does this game have to be?
[94:59.31]I understand it's a fucking horror game, but holy shit.
[95:03.29]My night vision would have been fine right now.
[95:11.92]Oh, if my eyes didn't feel good already.
[95:23.67]I thought that said I have a cat.
[95:25.63]Please don't kill me.
[95:26.81]I got a cat.
[95:33.94]Okay, get that coffee mug.
[95:36.94]Use that later.
[95:48.89]Straight through, straight ahead.
[95:57.46]Bad guys, not quite.
[95:59.46]Pharmacy, treatment rooms.
[96:01.96]I have to go in there.
[96:06.32]That was delicious.
[96:07.22]That was a good, yummy cup.
[96:10.33]I gotta go in there.
[96:12.41]Fuck, man, like.
[96:13.17]Alright, movement, movement, movement.
[96:19.91]There's no bueno in this game.
[96:24.53]It's very much a no bueno movement game.
[96:26.69]Alright, somebody's got a... Is that a gun?
[96:36.24]Oh, is there a fucking velociraptor in here?
[96:42.67]Mask?
[96:43.87]It's a Hannibal Lecter mask.
[96:50.45]I was one of the doctors.
[96:55.40]I strangled the guy to death.
[96:56.86]Yeah, I remember that.
[96:59.00]Put it on.
[97:03.20]Alright, here we go.
[97:06.84]Fucking kill him!
[97:10.71]Okay.
[97:12.49]So what's the point of this?
[97:15.71]Wait, let me put that back on.
[97:16.63]Hold on.
[97:22.08]What else is in here?
[97:29.62]Okay, get me out of here.
[97:30.88]I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[97:34.02]Take the mask off of him?
[97:35.01]I don't know.
[97:49.56]I guess we just keep going.
[97:52.27]Nothing over here, right?
[97:53.53]Let me just check.
[97:55.23]So you never know.
[97:57.49]Switch hands.
[98:05.46]Gets a little raw.
[98:07.58]Your hand gets a little raw playing this one.
[98:16.47]I'm gonna assume just treatment rooms.
[98:18.33]So that was just, that was just lore.
[98:22.41]I guess.
[98:26.57]Doctor of the Year?
[98:27.79]Probably me.
[98:29.71]Oh, here we go.
[98:39.82]Oh, okay.
[98:40.10]I thought I was like inside of my apartment or something.
[98:46.38]Security station.
[98:48.58]No reason to go this way.
[98:50.02]Laboratory.
[98:56.19]This door's locked.
[99:03.07]And here is the bath.
[99:04.70]This is the bath station.
[99:06.94]I'm a patient!
[99:19.86]It's just condemned.
[99:22.82]He's gonna get eaten.
[99:26.67]Oh, he's gonna get fucking eaten.
[99:30.23]This is gonna be a situation.
[99:35.69]They're all dead.
[99:39.39]Dead Space 2, when the guy gets an alien behind him and gets his face ripped off.
[99:46.67]He turns into one of those plant monsters.
[99:50.10]That's what's going to happen to this guy.
[99:55.08]How come he gets a weapon?
[99:57.12]That doesn't seem very fair at all.
[100:04.16]Wait, hold on.
[100:04.66]Is this the guy that... That's not the guy that was pushing the wheelchair before, right?
[100:11.29]I don't think it is.
[100:16.07]You lead the way, dude.
[100:16.69]I'm following you.
[100:23.84]So, what's there to do for fun around here, man?
[100:29.45]Been impatient for like a couple weeks.
[100:32.33]They keep showing the same three movies, like on an airplane.
[100:35.45]Anything else to do?
[100:37.07]I don't know how many times I can watch the first Mummy movie.
[100:52.08]Oh, you want me to go, okay.
[101:03.39]Keep going.
[101:03.91]Let's go.
[101:04.31]Wait, I need a weapon.
[101:05.75]I got this.
[101:06.72]I can handle this.
[101:07.82]No.
[101:09.98]I need that.
[101:14.00]Where'd he go?
[101:16.68]Oh, this is going to be hard.
[101:17.36]I have to press two buttons at the same time.
[101:18.66]They're not going to work.
[101:23.86]I have to hold.
[101:24.78]I have to hold.
[101:26.12]I forget which button it is.
[101:26.80]How do you not let go?
[101:28.08]Shit!
[101:30.21]Weeks, maybe months, man.
[101:34.30]I had to hold both buttons and I forgot which one it was to let it go.
[101:38.71]Move is this... I gotta turn back.
[101:49.15]I don't know what happened.
[101:49.85]This whole place has got the stench of something rotten.
[101:55.99]Since they brought those miners here, they were supposed to get better.
[102:00.25]Jesus.
[102:03.00]That's exactly what I'd call it.
[102:09.58]What happened?
[102:12.38]Well, hard to say exactly, but... You got socks on?
[102:19.29]They went wild, like they were possessed, like turned into literal monsters.
[102:26.18]Am I annoying at all?
[102:31.25]Let me see if it hurts.
[102:37.03]Wait, what do we have to do?
[102:37.81]I'm not that bright as you can see.
[102:43.72]I like the look of lights.
[102:44.48]I'm like a bug.
[102:46.26]Think of me like a moth.
[102:49.06]I have some moth blood.
[102:50.16]We want to go that way.
[102:57.16]Alright, follow me.
[102:59.56]Give me the countdown.
[103:00.10]What's the over-under on this guy dying in 25 seconds?
[103:03.22]Stay near me, will you?
[103:04.70]I'm almost to Bragg's office.
[103:09.16]I'm getting close to Bragg's.
[103:11.86]I'd be there too, but... No one's going to get that reference.
[103:15.39]Why would I make it?
[103:15.95]I had to go back.
[103:18.35]And Suzanne and I are his escorts.
[103:22.41]They should be waiting for me at his office.
[103:24.51]I came out here to scope it out.
[103:26.59]Knife.
[103:38.60]Okay.
[103:40.14]It's, man.
[103:42.38]Thumb.
[103:43.26]Thumb is walk.
[103:44.80]Trigger is hold.
[103:52.07]I'm not afraid to use this, man.
[103:54.67]I'm not afraid to put cream cheese on a bagel.
[103:57.69]Watch your step.
[103:58.19]Make it nice and slow.
[104:00.00]I'm going to do like an anime, like karate stance.
[104:07.03]I got to do like a powered up stance like from Dragon Ball.
[104:20.95]Why is that?
[104:24.83]This is a table.
[104:27.37]Get this way.
[104:28.01]I think it's them.
[104:32.91]Gives me the chills every time.
[104:35.80]Okay, don't let go of the trigger.
[104:37.54]Good.
[104:40.47]I gotta get my fucking anime stats ready.
[104:49.20]I still got it, right?
[105:04.90]Alright, am I... Hold on, let me see.
[105:06.32]You need a shave?
[105:10.77]You can't get close to the people.
[105:12.21]It's like the fucking Matrix.
[105:31.68]I can't...
[105:33.68]Oh, I can't open this.
[105:34.80]Can I open this with a knife?
[105:35.78]I can.
[105:47.10]It's just too dark.
[105:49.52]You made your game too dark.
[106:00.43]Shut that up.
[106:05.31]Bedpan or lantern?
[106:07.09]No, knife.
[106:09.51]I could maybe cause like a... I could maybe cause like a first or second degree barrier with this.
[106:13.55]This looks like I have a big index finger holding up like Jack Skellington.
[106:21.45]I don't think so.
[106:37.38]They're shooting at us!
[106:47.81]Yep.
[106:52.91]All that pressure and all that time, my arm hurts from doing that.
[106:57.25]You take it away from me.
[106:58.13]What about the desk fan?
[106:58.98]Give me the desk fan.
[107:07.26]I don't want to see this guy.
[107:08.08]We've got to see this guy die.
[107:11.30]Oh, god damn it.
[107:12.86]Turn around.
[107:15.68]We need to see this death.
[107:16.42]This is the whole point of the game.
[107:17.36]Get in there!
[107:19.02]Oh my god, your controls are the fucking worst.
[107:26.28]Oh my god.
[107:29.32]Just...
[107:31.16]Why wouldn't you have it so, like, if my hands both go to the side of the screen, it'll turn a little... It's just walk forward or, like, jerk.
[107:40.17]Or, like... Hey, it's me!
[107:44.05]Sorry, I took so long.
[107:45.86]I was dealing with the fucking terrible game controls.
[107:48.12]Hey, so when are you going to shoot him?
[107:49.66]David, why the hell would you bring him here?
[107:52.22]I don't... What's the big deal?
[107:53.74]I couldn't just leave him... Quick, quick!
[107:56.66]Something to destroy him.
[107:57.42]Something to hurt him.
[107:58.46]Oh, fuck.
[107:59.97]You monster.
[108:03.91]I can't move.
[108:07.51]So, patient.
[108:10.65]How are we feeling today?
[108:12.27]I feel pretty good.
[108:14.59]Uh... Why did you leave us to die?
[108:21.05]Answer!
[108:22.59]Ah, my light of truth.
[108:23.63]You caught off guard.
[108:26.05]None of this was... It just wasn't how it was supposed to... Hmm.
[108:33.89]Yeah.
[108:34.49]You know, like Wonder Woman?
[108:35.71]You ever seen the movie Wonder Woman, when she has that thing that makes you tell the truth?
[108:40.19]Seems to me you might be losing your mind here.
[108:46.59]I think... Think?
[108:49.05]You're right.
[108:50.63]I think... How did it come to this?
[108:55.49]I should never have come back.
[108:57.09]Sorry, I... I thought I could right the ship.
[109:03.38]I'm going to piss in this.
[109:05.00]But you can't steer a ship in a squall.
[109:07.36]It's going to stink in here.
[109:09.28]Mr. Brad, you've been down before.
[109:11.36]Wait a minute.
[109:12.10]You'll pull us all through.
[109:13.02]I know you will.
[109:13.64]I didn't ask you any questions.
[109:14.64]Oh, Suzanne, my dear.
[109:18.04]I admire your optimism.
[109:20.12]Optimism?
[109:20.79]What are you, drunk?
[109:22.75]Yes, he is.
[109:29.61]a big typewriter no Mr. bragg please let's just go to the chapel the storm's lit up the police are on their way to the chapel thank you go now somebody break through the wall please we can't leave you behind it's not safe oversized diplomas please you know we all have to go everyone brag included
[110:03.51]Yeah, he should come with us.
[110:06.19]He should come.
[110:10.10]What, are you married to it?
[110:13.16]Right here.
[110:15.46]High five.
[110:16.70]Give me a high five.
[110:32.68]So we're leaving.
[110:37.07]Do I follow them?
[110:40.21]Get out!
[110:41.09]Leave me alone!
[110:43.73]Haven't you done enough damage?
[110:50.94]You should come with us!
[110:54.50]I'll be right behind you.
[111:04.74]What if this is salt and pepper shakers?
[111:06.08]Can I like fuck with those?
[111:07.02]Alright, let's just go in.
[111:10.50]Look at him wearing his shoes.
[111:12.72]I'll be right behind you.
[111:13.52]That was a lie.
[111:13.94]He's going to lock the door.
[111:14.61]He's going to lock himself in.
[111:17.27]That's fine.
[111:19.73]Where did they go?
[111:20.19]Oh, right there.
[111:27.67]I tried to convince him, but he was being a real old fart about it.
[111:45.30]I tried to convince him, but he's been real far about it.
[111:47.58]I just don't understand.
[111:54.09]Why wouldn't Bragg want to come with us?
[111:56.03]He's an alien.
[111:56.61]He's a monster.
[111:57.11]He's a werewolf.
[111:57.73]He's one of those guys.
[111:58.63]He's one of those things.
[112:03.91]It's almost like lost footing right there.
[112:06.89]It might be time to take a break.
[112:09.57]Oh, Jesus.
[112:10.17]Look at that.
[112:10.63]Oh, God.
[112:11.59]It's awful.
[112:13.27]Christ, what happened here?
[112:17.01]What do we do to deserve this?
[112:18.37]I'm really sick of walking around behind somebody in this part of the game.
[112:22.29]Like, somebody's got to get their, like, body exploded, right?
[112:27.73]When's, like, the guy that comes over and, like, jumps on and through their mouth?
[112:34.43]Here it comes.
[112:36.24]Somebody coming from back here.
[112:44.14]No rush or anything, right, guys?
[112:45.48]No sense of urgency.
[112:47.70]It's not like there's a potential murderous rampaging werewolf that could be at around any corner at any time.
[112:56.40]Not a big deal though, it's okay.
[112:59.46]Let's default NPC walk to the path that we've been determined to take.
[113:06.64]Make sure to take a look around the VR and see the sights.
[113:08.92]Wow, cool, huh?
[113:10.16]It's snowy out there.
[113:13.48]Okay.
[113:15.32]Now what?
[113:27.36]After you.
[113:29.24]And you.
[113:32.46]You dick.
[113:34.24]He definitely didn't hear that.
[113:35.12]Okay, I'm trying to just kill my boredom here.
[113:44.79]I'm sorry.
[113:48.81]You're lucky I didn't start doing the dog from Dick Dastardly.
[113:51.75]Like that, like... I can't do it.
[113:56.53]Let me see, what are you guys saying?
[114:05.10]And me now!
[114:07.90]I'm wedged between them.
[114:09.94]We didn't think this through.
[114:11.20]Oh, you're so dead.
[114:11.82]He's so dead.
[114:23.17]The monster's going to jump over here.
[114:24.75]He's going to get his fucking body ripped open.
[114:27.03]I don't even want to see it.
[114:28.65]It's rated R. What if I just completely just screwed all you guys over and just looked... I was going to look over here at her and be like, I can't believe what I'm seeing.
[114:50.22]What's going on here?
[114:53.53]What is going on?
[114:56.89]Where's he going?
[115:01.13]You next or am I?
[115:01.97]I don't know.
[115:19.42]What do you think?
[115:21.79]I'll follow you.
[115:22.35]Go ahead.
[115:24.37]Okay.
[115:25.51]I'll go first then.
[115:26.67]Good.
[115:27.87]Go on.
[115:39.65]Why wouldn't we just go at the same time?
[115:44.26]Why does it have to be a cooldown for when humans can walk out the door?
[115:47.84]Why don't we just walk at the same time?
[115:49.10]Why would we separate this far apart?
[115:52.61]down the yellow brick road.
[115:54.29]Are you serious?
[115:55.05]Why would we do this?
[115:59.61]There's a thing there.
[116:10.09]Oh, no.
[116:12.40]Oh, no.
[116:13.12]It's a monster.
[116:15.16]It's killing her.
[116:17.16]Oh.
[116:18.38]Hey, what the heck was that, man?
[116:22.15]Why'd you do that?
[116:24.75]Oh, you know, probably could have done something, but my nails are a little getting a little too long.
[116:30.91]Huh?
[116:32.95]Shoot.
[116:34.19]Shoot, man.
[116:35.09]Yes, it's my turn.
[116:42.56]Oh, I don't know.
[116:46.14]Weird.
[116:50.59]Good thing I didn't go first.
[116:53.69]You made the right choice, Jeremy.
[117:04.00]Yep.
[117:05.00]It's already fed.
[117:05.84]It doesn't have to feed.
[117:06.70]It's like a shark.
[117:08.18]If a shark eats, it's not going to attack you.
[117:11.46]Just make sure it ate somebody first.
[117:15.74]Swim towards a school of fish.
[117:18.90]Is that him?
[117:19.58]Who the fuck is that?
[117:21.00]What?
[117:21.84]Who's this guy?
[117:24.42]Introducing new characters.
[117:29.17]Sorry, I have trouble with doors.
[117:33.09]Let me just go this way and... Ah, there we are.
[117:36.91]Nice to meet you.
[117:45.03]Not a talker.
[117:46.96]Okay.
[117:49.31]I can't go around you.
[117:51.33]I, uh, you know, I kind of need to go around you here.
[117:56.41]If you could just be a gentleman and, like, step over, like, this way.
[118:01.59]So I can go this way.
[118:05.15]This didn't have to happen.
[118:06.47]Okay, we can just go right through it.
[118:07.97]Now he wants to talk to me.
[118:13.14]What the fuck is happening?
[118:24.13]I think we're near the end of the game.
[118:26.55]If I were to take a guess.
[118:33.68]David, I thought you'd listen to me.
[118:36.56]Father, things got complicated.
[118:38.60]Forgive me for I've sinned.
[118:41.18]I knew it was too dangerous.
[118:43.20]Stop it.
[118:44.10]Suzanne's dead.
[118:45.49]Yes, so she is.
[118:49.69]And the old fool?
[118:51.89]I hate that you turned the fuck around.
[118:54.94]It's annoying to turn around that harshly.
[118:57.86]If Bragg had made up his mind, there's nothing on heaven or Earth that would... Why do none of you guys have lights?
[119:03.10]Father Ted Moser, I'm glad to meet another survivor.
[119:06.24]You can't... I can't shake his hand.
[119:09.05]She was so close.
[119:10.97]Once she moved and caught his attention, there was no chance.
[119:14.57]Give me a better view.
[119:15.23]I'm glad you made it back here.
[119:19.50]That's better.
[119:19.92]Oh, God.
[119:20.20]And they're all going to die.
[119:23.15]When do I get a gun?
[119:49.78]God damn it.
[119:51.24]Why Suzanne?
[119:52.66]Why?
[119:53.32]Imagine if I didn't have the flashlight.
[119:55.38]I'm sorry, David.
[119:56.22]This is unbearable.
[119:57.34]I know she meant a lot to you.
[119:59.36]This is what the day-to-day life is in here for these guys.
[120:03.46]Well, thank God you brought a flashlight.
[120:04.96]We can't fucking see anything.
[120:06.10]How do you not bump into everything down here?
[120:22.01]And he didn't believe you?
[120:23.67]Shocker.
[120:25.17]Said I'd lost my grip.
[120:27.43]Said there are no such things as evil spirits.
[120:30.90]I even started doubting myself.
[120:32.30]But now... What do you suggest we do?
[120:43.42]We have to wait.
[120:44.92]I don't want to wait.
[120:47.90]No, the police are never here in time.
[120:50.04]Going back to bed.
[120:50.56]Well, that's an item I need to grab.
[120:51.85]Okay.
[120:52.05]How do we get up there?
[120:53.35]That sounds like a fucking blast.
[121:15.91]Oh, this is going to be a blast.
[121:20.81]Coming to the pitch, pitch, total, total darkness.
[121:26.15]Church.
[121:27.67]And please find a way to climb up the stairs.
[121:29.51]I don't understand.
[121:48.03]The flashlight doesn't work now.
[121:53.63]Oh, it does.
[121:59.94]Okay, apparently I didn't need to go up there to touch that.
[122:02.86]Police are here.
[122:03.58]We're safe.
[122:11.95]No, no, no.
[122:13.03]Keep the doors locked.
[122:20.28]well that guy has a machine gun are they right here would you please come and help me help us help us oh we want oh me okay I thought you're talking to the officer outside
[122:48.06]I'm going to get stuck in this door.
[122:57.52]I helped.
[122:58.70]Oh, did you see that?
[123:09.30]What the fuck was that?
[123:18.09]Did I just get shot?
[123:21.42]Oh, did I lose the game?
[123:22.62]I got shot.
[123:35.19]No, apparently that's supposed to happen.
[123:43.99]Mm-hmm.
[123:59.95]Oh, well.
[124:02.17]Brought to you by the darkness!
[124:04.29]When's he gonna start calling me Jackie?
[124:09.50]Am I supposed to be seeing shit here?
[124:13.06]What's going on?
[124:25.26]Uh, can I?
[124:26.04]Hey.
[124:26.28]Hey.
[124:27.56]How are you feeling?
[124:30.84]Oh, thank God.
[124:31.50]Uh, what happened?
[124:33.95]I think I didn't drop my flashlight when I was unconscious.
[124:37.59]Let's just take it easy for now.
[124:39.65]You nearly caught a bullet with your skull.
[124:42.29]Took a tumble and hit your head pretty hard.
[124:45.55]You'll be alright.
[124:46.97]Why would they just open fire like that?
[124:49.58]The police saw the minor, what he'd become, and they reacted.
[124:54.59]Reacted?
[124:55.87]People are dead, man.
[124:57.13]That's a pretty big fucking reaction.
[124:58.87]Pretty big.
[124:59.19]I think we all need to calm down.
[125:01.25]Think this through.
[125:02.03]Why?
[125:05.85]Why would they do that?
[125:07.58]Over the fire.
[125:09.46]Kill them all.
[125:11.02]That's our eating people.
[125:12.86]People are dead.
[125:14.96]Something's wrong with my flashlight.
[125:17.62]Maybe we should turn around.
[125:18.73]I mean, maybe the police didn't even follow us.
[125:22.55]We can make a run for the door in the chapel.
[125:26.45]Dumb plan.
[125:29.51]What's that noise?
[125:33.21]What do you mean?
[125:34.13]I don't hear anything.
[125:35.71]We have to get out of here.
[125:37.63]This tunnel leads to the hotel and from there, off the mountain.
[125:41.02]No, is that my going to have to walk behind somebody again?
[125:42.78]Hey, I'm no doctor, but let me check him out.
[125:50.22]I don't want to walk behind you.
[125:51.46]No, tell me I can't.
[125:52.99]You're looking a little off color.
[125:55.53]Tell me I can't, like, walk.
[125:56.75]It's pretty hard back there.
[125:58.45]Like, you have to wheel me, right?
[125:59.45]To wheel me around?
[126:01.77]Weird.
[126:05.01]We need to move.
[126:06.09]Now.
[126:07.13]Do you think you can stand?
[126:09.30]No.
[126:10.92]You're gonna have to... Somebody's gonna have to carry me.
[126:16.82]I really don't want to fucking walk behind these dudes anymore.
[126:22.34]This is just like, you couldn't ask for more filler.
[126:28.37]We should go.
[126:29.15]How are you holding up?
[126:34.65]I feel a lot better when I'm anywhere else but here.
[126:40.92]David, I know you and Suzanne were friends.
[126:44.64]Stop.
[126:45.90]Please.
[126:46.24]I can't talk about it right now.
[126:49.75]This is all just too fucked up.
[126:52.05]It is.
[126:52.31]Alright, so when do I turn into the monster and start eating people?
[126:57.79]That's what I want to know.
[126:58.43]That's all I care about.
[126:59.21]Here it comes, right?
[127:07.66]We loaded some extra assets, I think.
[127:10.15]Can we use the cable car now that the storm has let up?
[127:12.63]Victor keeps most of the place in lockdown for winter.
[127:15.49]I doubt Victor's even alive.
[127:17.47]Victor knows this place like the back of his hand.
[127:19.85]If anyone could make it, it's him.
[127:24.07]It's starting to lose me here.
[127:26.42]You really are.
[127:31.74]Victor?
[127:33.46]Is that you?
[127:39.86]It's him.
[127:40.66]He's throwing wrenches at us.
[127:42.00]It's alright.
[127:43.18]Victor's kind of a jokester.
[127:45.10]He pranks us.
[127:49.84]I can't even walk through this fucking door.
[127:58.13]How did you get in here?
[128:03.77]Victor manages to cram the entire hotel in here for the winter.
[128:08.30]We're so close to the end.
[128:10.82]We have to be.
[128:14.74]This is the end of the game.
[128:16.68]I can't just stop now.
[128:18.66]Even though my brain is about to fry from this VR.
[128:22.78]Something about the darkness.
[128:25.23]The flashlight.
[128:30.57]Did you see this?
[128:37.89]They ain't ever gonna get this right.
[128:39.09]You know what I mean?
[128:41.46]Some of the most brilliant minds in the world are, like, working on this shit and, like, look at it, like... Oh, I got the paper.
[128:57.78]Okay.
[128:58.18]Let's see.
[128:58.82]Uh, where are the posts?
[129:00.42]Uh, reporter assaulted on Blackwood Mountain.
[129:03.28]Interesting stuff.
[129:05.28]Why don't we keep moving?
[129:05.98]Let's get away from the fluff.
[129:21.11]This is such insane filler.
[129:22.53]There's nobody even going to talk during this.
[129:25.94]I'm on a monorail ride.
[129:30.84]Does it just walk through the dark house with a flashlight while some guy walks in front of you?
[129:34.76]The game.
[129:42.17]What the hell are you doing?
[129:45.59]What are you doing to me?
[129:54.21]What?
[129:56.05]I must ask, have you been left isolated, alone, recently?
[130:02.95]Oh, I'm scary, aren't I?
[130:05.54]Uh, why do you ask?
[130:09.66]I get the feeling you've been less than honest with me.
[130:19.76]What the hell is going on here?
[130:23.94]I'm afraid we're running out of time.
[130:26.94]David, keep your wits about you.
[130:29.96]Where are we?
[130:31.86]How far to the elevator?
[130:32.90]Yeah, how far to the elevator?
[130:34.04]Oh, God.
[130:34.18]When do I lose control?
[130:36.47]Wait, what's wrong with my hand?
[130:38.45]Oh, look at this.
[130:39.05]Take a look at me.
[130:39.81]How are my nails doing?
[130:52.75]Starting to turn into one of those monsters.
[130:54.13]I need to recalibrate here.
[130:59.15]Recalibrate.
[131:02.96]Did that work?
[131:29.56]Alright, not much.
[131:31.66]What about you guys?
[131:33.99]Yeah, that's what I thought.
[131:41.31]Okay, great.
[131:43.37]So, is that it?
[131:45.98]Is that all?
[131:46.62]Do you have anything to say?
[131:48.10]No, he was gonna say something.
[131:51.84]Oh, there it is.
[131:53.44]He thought about talking to me, then he was like, nah, I don't think I wanna do that.
[132:10.01]Alright, I'm gonna say it right now.
[132:11.39]I'm gonna say it, guys.
[132:12.47]I'm gonna say this out loud.
[132:15.56]What the fuck is this?
[132:20.32]What is this?
[132:20.86]Are you serious?
[132:29.71]We're just walking around.
[132:32.41]That's it?
[132:34.03]What is this shit?
[132:35.41]Give me a break.
[132:38.06]Really?
[132:52.08]Oh, so, sorry.
[132:53.00]You pipe down.
[132:54.02]Okay, I'll be quiet.
[132:54.76]Alright.
[133:02.20]Head to the elevator.
[133:05.16]Quiet.
[133:06.10]Yeah, quiet.
[133:14.02]We're in here!
[133:14.64]Get away to the elevator.
[133:15.62]One second, one second.
[133:16.96]Go.
[133:17.02]Oh, you want me to be quiet?
[133:19.22]Sure.
[133:20.63]Police!
[133:35.10]Fucking assholes.
[133:35.82]He's gonna get grabbed.
[133:47.48]No he's not.
[133:48.64]It'll be too easy.
[133:50.27]Oh, where are we going guys?
[133:52.51]This is a great tour.
[133:55.13]You know, I heard, I heard the lobby was erected in 2001.
[134:05.88]And did you know that the Founding Fathers... This is not good.
[134:12.90]Oh, sorry.
[134:13.96]He must have fallen down.
[134:16.04]Founding Fathers used to eat lunch in this elevator in this hotel lobby.
[134:21.79]And if you look on your left when we get out of here, there's a bar.
[134:25.23]It's called On Top of the Horse.
[134:28.15]And it was Paul Revere.
[134:29.47]Paul Revere, actually, guys.
[134:32.01]He stopped in there from time to time.
[134:33.35]It was a local watering hole.
[134:35.53]And I really enjoyed it.
[134:36.43]And get one of those special drinks.
[134:37.93]It's called The British Are Coming.
[134:41.18]It's two parts gin.
[134:43.70]One... Two parts gin.
[134:47.14]Looks like it got hit by one of the bullets.
[134:54.25]Damn it.
[134:55.39]What now?
[134:55.85]I don't fucking know.
[135:01.61]I know just how that panel feels.
[135:03.97]You're coming back to finish the job.
[135:08.97]Where are we going?
[135:09.65]Are we like... I can't move.
[135:11.05]I just don't have this flashlight.
[135:14.11]This is so useless.
[135:16.49]Don't worry.
[135:16.83]At least where I can point is... I can point them in the right direction of where to go.
[135:19.88]You know what I'm saying?
[135:22.78]Just in case.
[135:29.09]Duracell.
[135:31.25]Always a good decision.
[135:34.33]Did we just go up to go down to see a loading screen?
[135:37.23]Everyone just calm down.
[135:40.19]There's no point in panicking.
[135:41.93]He's fine.
[135:43.49]We have to get out of here now.
[135:46.88]Oh no, let's go upstairs and load a game and then go downstairs and load this part of the game.
[135:52.56]Who's that?
[135:53.64]Show yourself.
[135:55.24]Found him.
[135:58.24]Oh, he has a gun.
[135:58.80]Okay, coming right up.
[136:03.32]Why don't we go back upstairs?
[136:26.88]Yeah, that was a little scary.
[136:30.72]I don't want to go down there.
[136:31.74]The parking garage has all kinds of rats and shit.
[136:35.56]Sorry about that.
[136:43.30]What the hell is going on?
[136:44.92]I heard shots.
[136:46.16]Who's this guy?
[136:47.39]Victor, it's the police.
[136:49.53]Who's the...
[136:51.15]If we don't leave, they will execute every single one of us they can find.
[136:54.49]Who's this guaranteed guy that's going to die right now?
[136:57.77]Can you get the door open from your side?
[136:59.57]I think so, yeah.
[137:03.66]I hope we go back down.
[137:07.64]I swear to God, if we go back down in the elevator, it's going to be perfect.
[137:15.13]Yeah, watch it.
[137:16.11]Hurry up!
[137:19.69]Look out!
[137:23.07]Oh, let's get out of here.
[137:25.86]Oh!
[137:26.76]Oh, right, me.
[137:27.70]Oh, sorry, that was the door guy.
[137:28.86]I forgot about that.
[137:29.84]Oh, let me just go ahead and close this door here.
[137:34.02]Ah!
[137:36.02]Ah, you know, I may have, I may have, uh... Don't speak.
[137:50.47]The guy just got...
[137:52.92]Why are we going down again?
[137:55.88]Oh, I need to sit down.
[138:02.05]This is a joke.
[138:12.27]Can this fucking game end?
[138:23.20]We just like to sit with the door open now.
[138:24.76]I can't go anywhere.
[138:29.46]That guy had a total of... Okay, you know what?
[138:31.89]I got to pause the game because this is important to talk about.
[138:34.41]I can't.
[138:35.69]No.
[138:36.15]I don't want to share any clips.
[138:38.81]Oh, God damn it.
[138:40.37]Damn it.
[138:43.50]You know that guy.
[138:46.26]That was like that extra in this movie.
[138:48.12]He was so happy to be in this movie.
[138:49.88]Look at me.
[138:50.60]He went to the premiere and he was with his whole family.
[138:52.88]They were watching.
[138:53.52]He's like, mom, mom, mom, dad, look, here it comes.
[138:55.46]He was on screen for like fucking one minute.
[138:57.46]He got to be like the janitor that gets killed.
[138:59.48]That would be so awesome.
[139:00.40]Bring your whole family to that shit.
[139:02.42]He was so stoked about that.
[139:07.36]He got to be an extra in this movie.
[139:09.24]It was just like, holy shit, that's cool.
[139:11.58]We shouldn't be making fun of that guy.
[139:12.84]We should be happy about that.
[139:14.80]Is he dead?
[139:16.62]This didn't have to happen.
[139:18.72]You know it didn't.
[139:20.71]What did I... Oh no, my choices mattered.
[139:26.48]How is he dead?
[139:27.00]He's dead?
[139:30.20]Well, sorry, I had bad choices.
[139:31.76]You know what else was bad?
[139:33.22]Walking around behind you two for 25 minutes.
[139:36.44]You want me to care about characters and choices?
[139:38.10]The cable car can't be operated from inside.
[139:40.60]That ain't how you do it.
[139:41.42]Someone needs to stay.
[139:43.25]Please let me go.
[139:44.23]Let me go.
[139:44.59]I want to go.
[139:45.99]Stay back.
[139:53.42]I don't want to stay.
[139:54.10]Please let me be the one to go.
[139:56.28]Look, I'll bring the Bible.
[139:57.90]And I'll be safe.
[139:59.56]That's the Bible, right?
[140:03.67]Sure.
[140:06.09]They won't be able to hurt me when I have the Bible.
[140:11.21]It's gonna be out of my hands.
[140:12.95]Do not come any closer.
[140:16.49]The Wendigo is not an infection.
[140:18.63]It's a curse.
[140:20.30]punishment for an unforgivable sin.
[140:23.90]You have consumed the flesh of another human being.
[140:28.02]You're a monster.
[140:28.92]I don't know if that's in here.
[140:33.69]I'm sorry.
[140:35.19]I cannot allow you to leave this mountain.
[140:37.73]Oh.
[140:42.99]You sure ain't nothing in here that can help, Father?
[140:47.93]I'm sorry.
[140:49.55]You're beyond help.
[140:51.57]The curse cannot be reversed.
[140:54.16]The monster will soon be all that's left of you.
[140:57.08]But your last moments of humanity need not be in vain.
[141:01.04]What do we do?
[141:07.35]I'm not staying here.
[141:09.91]No?
[141:11.75]What?
[141:13.59]You're going to kill me?
[141:18.18]He's like an evil button.
[141:22.32]Don't.
[141:23.56]What?
[141:24.20]Don't.
[141:40.95]Cool.
[141:41.67]Alright.
[141:42.79]So I was the monster the whole time.
[141:43.96]That's why they kept us locked away and gave us sandwiches.
[141:46.20]Those sandwiches were made out of people.
[141:51.76]Cast has repeated at the request of picture patrons who desire to check the names of performers whose work has pleased them.
[141:58.96]That's it.
[141:59.36]That's the game.
[142:03.52]Anybody else here?
[142:05.97]No.
[142:06.03]What are these?
[142:22.01]Memories.
[142:24.39]Uh-oh.
[142:27.17]So that's how you turned into the Wendigo.
[142:32.02]Weakness.
[142:32.58]Butterfly.
[142:33.62]Weakness.
[142:35.32]Deadly crossing.
[142:36.48]The nurse.
[142:37.44]Chance meeting.
[142:40.18]You were honest with David.
[142:41.66]You got David's trust.
[142:44.94]David stood up for you when talking to Bragg.
[142:47.68]I don't even remember who this guy was.
[142:50.93]That's how not invested I was in this entire game.
[142:52.80]I don't even know, who the fuck was this guy?
[142:54.28]Who was David?
[142:54.80]I don't know who that guy was.
[142:58.68]The nurse.
[143:00.00]You sided with Suzanne.
[143:01.24]Suzanne blamed herself for not convincing Bragg to leave.
[143:03.58]I don't know, who is this character?
[143:08.43]Were they in this game?
[143:12.99]Weakness.
[143:14.55]You succumbed to temptation.
[143:15.97]Bennett was killed in your room.
[143:19.96]Who's Bennett?
[143:22.08]Who's Bennett?
[143:23.72]Deadly crossing.
[143:25.62]You kept still when crossing the courtyard.
[143:27.84]Ted was glad you made it safely to the chapel.
[143:29.80]What do you mean I just kept still?
[143:37.40]There was a monster in this game?
[143:45.02]OK.
[143:47.88]I'm going to come on out of here now.
[143:55.33]That, my like brain hurts.
[143:59.03]Oh, actually, no, I'm just kidding.
[144:00.89]I knew who those people were.
[144:05.47]Is it a lack of immersion or a lack of attention?
[144:07.55]I don't know.
[144:14.25]That game was $40 by the way.
[144:17.46]Let's be really aware of that.
[144:20.30]Before you make any judgments on the fact that it was like a two and a half hour long game, that game was 40 bucks.
[144:28.63]That seems like a little bit of money for a two hour game.
[144:38.48]Anyways.
[144:42.92]Let me... Refund?
[144:47.04]No.
[144:49.76]I thought it was cool, it was fun, it was funny.
[144:52.32]It had some scary moments, but I'm not sure if that was worth $40.
[144:59.22]I would say that's worth like, more like 60.
[145:02.24]They deserve the money.
[145:05.52]I just stepped on the PSVR thing.
[145:08.74]No, that was like a, I don't know, take away the price.
[145:13.99]Well, let's just put it this way.
[145:14.91]Like Resident Evil 7's DLC, that free DLC they made was like a four hour campaign.
[145:20.89]And that was free.
[145:26.47]You can admit the game was bad.
[145:32.03]But I, I need to take a break because more than two and a half hours in this thing, I don't know what, this game for some reason was just fucking me up.
[145:41.82]I need to like go relax.
[145:44.24]So that's probably going to be it for tonight.
[145:46.06]I really didn't think it was going to take that much out of me.
[145:47.68]Two or three of those jump scares in like the dark room and turning around, I'm like, I'm kind of all fucked up right now.
[145:53.62]But, but, before we go anywhere, Monster Hunter: World is coming out tomorrow.
[146:05.83]And I'm going to be playing Monster Hunter: World
[146:09.39]I got to take a break.
[146:10.05]That's it for the night.
[146:11.25]Well, break as in I got to go away from my computer and rest my eyes for a few hours.
[146:18.69]Yeah, Monster Hunter: World is out at midnight tonight.
[146:21.48]So you'll be seeing me and Etalyx play that tomorrow.
[146:25.42]I'm looking forward to it.
[146:27.00]I mean, you guys can't even see me talking.
[146:32.64]Here.
[146:34.22]Now it just looks like Robocop's eyes are bugging out of his head.
[146:37.36]This doesn't look right.
[146:38.18]This looks like a shitty Robocop costume that your mother made you when you were like fucking nine.
[146:43.91]Anyways.
[146:46.21]We will be playing Monster Hunter tomorrow.
[146:49.55]I got to pick up a class and everything.
[146:51.19]Should be fun.
[146:52.23]I'm looking forward to it.
[146:55.38]And away we go.
[146:59.74]I'm going to get covered some of these bits real quick.
[147:02.70]I'm going to take off the headset here.
[147:07.69]But thank you for watching.
[147:09.29]Sorry we only had about two and a half hours or so.
[147:14.45]I'm just like racked after playing this game.
[147:17.96]Oh, I'm ripping hairs out, that hurts.
[147:25.10]There we are.
[147:27.64]Okay, so if you're not sticking around, then take care.
[147:32.08]Let's read some of these bits.
[147:35.62]What hair?
[147:41.36]At least the PS Move controller didn't turn off.
[147:45.92]Way of racked after watching it.
[147:51.27]It was an experience, wasn't it?
[147:54.61]No, we're not doing a 24-hour stream tomorrow.
[147:56.39]No way.
[147:59.75]Let's turn this.
[148:03.07]There we are.
[148:05.17]Alright, so let me move you over.
[148:20.45]Alright, so thank you to A.E.
[148:24.85]Strong, thanks for the $4.
[148:27.38]Flatman Bob, thanks for the $0.25.
[148:29.12]Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope.
[148:33.36]Yeah, I'm muted.
[148:33.90]Just go.
[148:34.16]I can move the mic back to a better position.
[148:37.90]Mr. Dunwich, thanks for the 25 cents.
[148:39.65]Most of the confidences were unsought.
[148:42.23]Frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity.
[148:48.11]This is from some book.
[148:49.95]Thank you, Mr. Dunwich.
[148:51.79]Fig Newton's Balls, thanks for the $1.
[148:54.35]Recently made it into art school.
[148:55.95]Just wanted to thank you for being such an artistic inspiration to me.
[148:59.32]Really?
[149:00.44]Well...
[149:01.62]Hey, thank you.
[149:02.64]Thank you.
[149:03.00]You refuse to settle with what's been done and find creative solutions to every aspect of your medium.
[149:08.94]I may be going for illustration, but I've learned more about art from you than anyone else.
[149:13.01]You're always pushing the envelope and that gives me strength to do the same.
[149:15.67]Much love and thank you.
[149:16.59]Thank you so much, Fig Newton.
[149:20.07]I'm absolutely fucking humbled and thankful that you can find inspiration from me, of all places.
[149:29.98]I wish you the best of luck.
[149:30.80]Thank you so much.
[149:34.07]That means a lot.
[149:36.95]Thank you for the $1 as well.
[149:40.05]GrayTax, thank you for the $5.
[149:42.41]Here, go buy yourself some hard-boiled eggs because that greedy bastard ate the last one.
[149:48.00]I will.
[149:49.24]In fact, I can buy quite a few eggs with $5.
[149:50.88]I can get like probably 12 eggs.
[149:52.92]More than that.
[149:54.81]Hey, Topac, thanks for $5.
[149:56.49]So much for the Vive fund.
[149:58.54]I want a return on my investment.
[150:02.74]At least 10,000 Satoshis or a Vive stream.
[150:06.74]Well, this was on PSVR only.
[150:10.94]Right?
[150:12.83]So much for the fucking Vive.
[150:17.51]Don't worry, I'm getting a Vive.
[150:20.03]Don't worry, it's gonna happen.
[150:22.51]I will get a Vive.
[150:23.45]There's so many games I haven't played that I want to play on Vive.
[150:28.97]Can I offer you an egg in this trying time?
[150:32.83]Thank you, though, Topec, for the five bucks.
[150:34.57]Hole of One Zombie, thanks for the five bucks.
[150:37.43]Why does this feel like a bad Quantum Leap episode?
[150:42.06]I actually never really watched that show.
[150:44.42]So I don't really... I don't understand the reference.
[150:46.42]But I'm sure it's funny.
[150:48.36]But I just never watched.
[150:49.56]But thank you, though.
[150:51.43]Ben Elnor, welcome back, Ben.
[150:53.25]Gave 50 bucks earlier, added 30.
[150:55.21]30 bucks.
[150:57.05]I know most of the bits I give are random, but I genuinely enjoy all the content you create and everything you do for us as a community.
[151:05.00]You're the best and will always be the best in my book.
[151:08.24]Thanks, Jerma.
[151:10.06]Well, thank you, Ben.
[151:11.94]Thank you.
[151:14.78]You've been a massive contributor to this stream.
[151:18.21]And it boggles my mind that you continue to still have money to give me.
[151:23.39]After, like, after the countless amounts of times you've given more than $50 to $100 on stream.
[151:31.87]Thank you so much, dude.
[151:35.52]Hey, Penn, thanks for the $1.
[151:36.76]Hey, Jerma, just an update.
[151:37.60]It's been a week or two without Adderall and I've never felt better.
[151:41.50]My BPM and blood pressure are back to normal and I don't have to deal with shitty dry mouth.
[151:46.77]I just got to get used to being a scatterbrained fuck now, which kind of sucks.
[151:52.26]But use it to your advantage.
[151:53.94]First of all, I'm glad that you're feeling much better.
[151:57.26]Use that to your advantage, though.
[151:59.04]Just because you scatterbrained doesn't mean that you can't get things done.
[152:01.86]Just focus on one thing at a time, do it really well, and then scatterbrain to something else and do that just as well.
[152:09.75]Eventually, you'll run back and cycle back to the first thing and you'll get it done.
[152:16.29]Thank you for the $1, though, dude.
[152:18.88]Ben, again, earlier gave $20 more.
[152:23.04]Collusion stream.
[152:26.38]What does that mean?
[152:28.52]Collusion?
[152:32.26]Did I say collusion during the stream at some point?
[152:35.14]Maybe I did.
[152:37.38]Hey, Matters of Darkness, thanks for the $5.
[152:38.58]And just like that, $5 everyone.
[152:41.42]Everyone.
[152:45.18]Is this like a God bless us everyone Tiny Tim moment here?
[152:47.56]$5 for everyone?
[152:51.48]No, thanks, dude.
[152:54.06]Dunkster, thanks for the $1.
[152:55.22]Hey, Jeremy, I've been having a really tough time lately.
[152:58.25]And you've been a light in the dark for me.
[152:59.97]Thank you for everything.
[153:03.87]Day by day, man.
[153:04.59]Each day.
[153:05.89]Small steps.
[153:08.55]Just try to do your best every day.
[153:11.77]But thank you.
[153:13.39]If, like I said this a bunch of times before, if you can find some happiness from watching this stream, you don't even know what that means to hear that.
[153:27.46]Thank me for everything.
[153:28.12]Thank you for everything.
[153:29.56]Thank you so much for sticking around.
[153:32.54]Hope you feel better.
[153:33.68]I truly, really hope that.
[153:38.00]And Snoozencopter, thanks for the $1.
[153:42.67]Jeremiah, why aren't you going to play Dragon Ball Fighters even though you're a fan?
[153:46.10]Even though you're not a fan of fighting games or Dragon Ball?
[153:49.26]Or did I just answer my own question?
[153:51.22]Anyway, love you.
[153:51.80]Been a fan for a long time.
[153:52.78]Stay lovely.
[153:53.40]Thanks.
[153:53.78]And also, I love you too, Snoozy.
[153:55.62]Thanks that you said that.
[154:00.70]That was good.
[154:02.96]That was a good one.
[154:03.82]That was a very... You got me.
[154:05.00]That was good.
[154:05.54]I liked it.
[154:07.64]Talk thanks for the $1.
[154:08.84]I was actually going to unsub if you played Doki Doki.
[154:11.46]I'm not gonna play Doki Doki Literature Club.
[154:14.20]Don't you understand?
[154:14.82]Like that was just a fucking dumb meme shit joke that we had like two streams ago.
[154:20.36]But I'm gonna do the whole thing.
[154:21.12]I played through the whole thing and it's gonna take about 12 hours straight.
[154:24.20]But that's not gonna happen ever.
[154:26.74]Then you bake me home for the $1.
[154:27.86]And that's where we ended up.
[154:32.11]We talked about Wade Boggs.
[154:35.77]A Styx Renegade thanks for the $1 earlier.
[154:37.88]Roses are red, Jerm is great, but unfortunately he's always late.
[154:41.60]This is true.
[154:43.76]And to wrap it up, Kil'Gannon just came in here at the end with $5.
[154:48.80]$5 everyone.
[154:49.56]FeelsBirthdayMan.
[154:51.74]FeelsBirthdayMan.
[154:53.50]Thank you for the $5.
[154:55.18]And also to MooMeansMoo for the $1.
[154:57.12]Born.
[154:57.50]I even screwed up my self-deprecating joke.
[155:01.84]FeelsBadMan.
[155:02.66]We got a FeelsBirthdayMan and then a FeelsBadMan.
[155:06.48]Damn.
[155:08.10]That's back-to-back mans.
[155:10.28]Like, frog mans.
[155:11.88]What's his name?
[155:13.23]Popo the Clown?
[155:14.03]Popo the Frog?
[155:15.47]I know.
[155:15.77]It's Pepe the fucking Clown.
[155:17.11]I know what he is.
[155:18.51]Pepe the Frog.
[155:19.21]I know what it is.
[155:22.15]Moo means moo thanks for the $5.
[155:23.63]What an absolutely disappointing game.
[155:25.55]Now I know my parents felt... Now I know how my parents felt when I was bored.
[155:29.97]Also, smash your PSVR on stream when you get a Vive.
[155:40.37]Yeah, Pepe Le Pew.
[155:42.05]I know who he is, that frog.
[155:44.39]Pepe Le Pew from the Looney Tunes.
[155:47.90]A DSGZ thanks for the $5.
[155:49.74]Hey, Gerber.
[155:51.30]You should check out Subnautica.
[155:53.24]Basic premises, survival sandbox on an underwater alien planet.
[155:57.84]Just hit 1.0 and might be fun for a one-off stream sometime in the future.
[156:00.72]By the way, what a shitshow.
[156:02.10]Love you, Gerber.
[156:04.94]Subnautica is one of those games that I feel like has been around for so long.
[156:08.43]that I heard about it, I watched a couple people play it a long time ago, and I'm talking like at least a year or two ago.
[156:15.71]Is the game actually good?
[156:20.15]Or is it just one of those games that's... I always felt like it was one of those, hey, here's another crafting survival game that's, you know, 400 of them are on Steam.
[156:29.26]Maybe I'll give it a look.
[156:32.34]But with that, that it is.
[156:33.76]It is very good.
[156:34.52]Okay.
[156:35.86]Maybe I'll give it a try.
[156:38.46]But I will see you guys tomorrow.
[156:40.54]Have a great rest of your evening.
[156:41.84]Have a good rest of your night.
[156:45.33]I will see you tomorrow for Monster Hunter: World launch.
[156:49.28]Me and Etalyx are going to play the hell out of it tomorrow night.
[156:53.09]Hope to see you there.
[156:54.61]Hopefully it's fun.
[156:56.57]Have a good night.
[156:57.59]And again, sorry that this is only like a two and a half hour stream.
[157:00.39]I just... Sometimes when I get in the VR helmet, man, I can go like two or three hours.
[157:05.07]And then like after four hours, like I'll puke.
[157:08.85]So I don't really want to get there.
[157:10.03]So like I kind of want to just stop after a few hours.
[157:13.21]Anyways, good night, everybody.
[157:14.43]See you tomorrow.
[157:15.25]Take care.
[157:28.92]you
