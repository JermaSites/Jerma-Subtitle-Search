[04:31.04]Oh, what the fuck?
[04:34.78]There are some jump scares.
[04:41.84]Am I on drugs?
[04:42.66]I don't do drugs.
[04:44.00]Unless it's prescribed by a fucking physician.
[04:46.02]So, no.
[04:49.92]How about this?
[04:51.44]For me to do face cam, I'm going to have to fucking comb my hair and reposition my camera.
[05:00.64]No, we'll be fine.
[05:02.98]This is about the characters.
[05:04.04]It's not about me.
[05:07.58]This shit's about the characters.
[05:08.81]Look at this.
[05:10.93]Look at this, like, fucking hair.
[05:15.11]We're like a fucking, like, bird president.
[05:20.52]Uh, why is my windows are open too?
[05:21.82]Okay.
[05:24.24]The face cam's going off.
[05:27.08]I don't want to do it.
[05:28.36]It's over.
[05:34.48]Looking fresh.
[05:36.22]I am a character.
[05:37.38]Let's start with it off.
[05:38.90]We're going to do traditional controls.
[05:40.26]I'm not doing motion controls.
[05:41.46]Fuck that.
[05:45.26]And look, there's not going to be a jump scare.
[05:47.72]And this is really loud, so I'm going to turn it down.
[05:52.02]There's not going to be a jump scare in the fucking opening credits.
[06:00.33]This is the opening cutscene.
[06:01.95]Alright, there was a jump scare.
[06:03.33]There was a jump scare in the opening credits.
[06:05.67]And I fucking missed it.
[06:07.69]Alright?
[06:08.33]So, I did jump a little bit.
[06:09.67]I fucking already... Okay.
[06:14.57]So, I was wrong.
[06:15.53]Let's go with the settings.
[06:16.33]Let's just make sure there's no fucking jump scares.
[06:18.11]Can we turn the jump scares off?
[06:19.81]There it is.
[06:20.59]Jump scares set to off, please.
[06:24.58]Subtitles, you guys.
[06:25.40]I know you guys want... What is the sidebar text?
[06:29.34]Now I need a face cam.
[06:30.53]Fuck, come on.
[06:31.51]No, I don't like face cam.
[06:33.29]I'm a nervous boy.
[06:34.37]Don't you know how that works?
[06:36.81]The game is actually pretty good with motion controls, really.
[06:38.51]That's fine.
[06:42.15]Control, I'm just going to leave it as is.
[06:44.68]I don't think it matters.
[06:45.32]It's not like it has any settings.
[06:48.16]Sidebar text on.
[06:49.28]You think so?
[06:52.64]I wish you could tell me what it is.
[06:53.92]Enable disable overlay text for written material while playing.
[07:01.56]Um... Is that, like, is that necessary?
[07:05.12]Or can we just go?
[07:07.28]I don't want a bunch of text on the screen.
[07:08.60]We gotta immerse ourselves.
[07:09.86]There's a fucking crying lady over here.
[07:18.67]Fucking seriously, like... There you go.
[07:25.84]No, I gotta fucking brush my teeth.
[07:27.36]No.
[07:27.80]You know what?
[07:28.26]No.
[07:28.64]I'll be right back.
[07:30.70]I'm not doing a face game until I brush my teeth.
[07:33.72]So, sorry guys.
[07:36.46]Like, we're gonna have to, uh, we're starting soon.
[07:40.60]No, I, I, I need to like... Alright, alright.
[07:52.89]I'm gonna, I'm gonna brush my teeth.
[07:53.93]I'll be back in like fucking two minutes.
[10:25.12]Alright, okay, here we go.
[10:28.40]Fucking had to, like, brush my teeth.
[10:32.78]Really, like... I mean, not gonna lie, really didn't want to brush my teeth today.
[10:39.79]It's been, like, fucking eight days.
[10:41.23]It's not true, I'm just kidding.
[10:43.49]Let me, like, get this, like... First of all, this fucking light is way too harsh.
[10:47.09]We're gonna change the lighting.
[10:47.89]This is gonna be, like, down.
[10:50.21]Come here, you.
[10:55.93]I wasn't expecting to do this.
[10:59.85]Do you like that deer in headlights looking into the fucking camera?
[11:04.05]I didn't even fucking comb my hair.
[11:05.38]Alright, I'm ready.
[11:07.60]No, I'm not ready.
[11:08.60]We've got to change the lighting.
[11:10.98]There's going to be one jump scare in this whole fucking entire game.
[11:15.12]And I'm going to be really, really annoyed that I went through all this trouble to brush my fucking teeth.
[11:20.00]Like, gross.
[11:21.68]Tastes like mint.
[11:22.88]I wanted the fucking bubblegum flavor, ma.
[11:25.77]That's fucking gross, by the way.
[11:26.91]Alright, hold on.
[11:29.69]Let me turn, let me get the lighting a little bit better here.
[11:32.71]And this face cam is going off in like 20 minutes, by the way.
[11:34.93]Like, just to let you fucking guys know.
[11:37.99]This face cam is only going to be on for like 10 fucking minutes.
[11:41.88]So here we go.
[11:42.76]Give it a little fucking sun.
[11:44.24]No, that's too dark.
[11:48.12]It's a scary game, though.
[11:50.34]What about deep sea?
[11:53.89]Blue?
[11:54.99]That's a little too blue.
[11:58.37]This is kind of like murder indie movie.
[12:01.51]So this works, I think, right?
[12:04.15]A little bit deeper.
[12:06.84]This one.
[12:07.32]No.
[12:08.20]The beach.
[12:09.18]The beach.
[12:09.52]I like the beach one.
[12:10.12]This one's good.
[12:13.03]Yeah.
[12:13.25]I think we got a home run on this one.
[12:16.48]Let me just go like this.
[12:20.98]Okay.
[12:21.36]Alright, we're good.
[12:23.16]This is what we're gonna do.
[12:24.86]I'm gonna sit like this.
[12:26.65]So I can actually fucking see.
[12:29.65]And yes, don't fucking give me shit.
[12:31.73]I don't care.
[12:32.51]One headphone is going in, guys.
[12:37.25]Oh, story.
[12:37.95]I'm not gonna move this down.
[12:41.04]Like this.
[12:46.13]So I'm just like a fucking sneaky boy, like down here.
[12:51.61]And that is good.
[12:54.95]There you go.
[12:55.63]Here's your face cam.
[12:56.35]Here's your fucking like 20 minute face cam.
[12:58.41]Let's go.
[12:58.81]New story.
[12:59.37]Let's go.
[12:59.67]Hopefully it's not too loud.
[13:02.95]In the beginning, all that existed was dinosaurs, right?
[13:09.58]And yes, I'm drinking coffee right now.
[13:11.30]That's just the way it is.
[13:12.36]Alright, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.
[13:15.80]Can't even see the chat.
[13:16.92]Now I can.
[13:21.02]That's better.
[13:23.09]I'm fucking brushing teeth.
[13:26.69]Hold on, hold on.
[13:27.83]I'm not technically not brushing my teeth anymore.
[13:30.43]So this has to go.
[13:31.41]Okay, that's fine.
[13:33.97]This is why I don't fucking do face cams.
[13:35.47]Because I can't, like, pay attention.
[13:36.73]All I can pay attention to is, like, that over there.
[13:39.75]I can see my own fucking face.
[13:41.91]And we're, like, getting the Game of Thrones intro right now.
[13:44.55]And, like, I'm not even paying attention to which house is in this season.
[13:47.19]So you choose your actions carefully.
[14:01.02]Alright, here we go.
[14:04.48]Hold on, let me look over at the camera again.
[14:07.94]How's the audio?
[14:08.46]Turn it up?
[14:10.30]Turn it up?
[14:12.02]Turn it up.
[14:14.36]I gotta pay attention to this shit, so like... I'm so like worried about this fucking camera.
[14:21.10]Alright, here we go.
[14:24.92]Time to pay attention.
[14:28.83]There's Jason.
[14:35.36]That's a bad guy.
[14:35.92]That girl's a bad guy.
[14:36.64]That one right there.
[14:37.18]The one that's talking.
[14:37.72]That's a bad guy right there.
[14:39.90]That girl that's doing the little dance right now.
[14:43.18]That's the bad guy.
[14:44.08]The guy in the lumberjack outfit's the bad guy.
[14:45.68]Shut up!
[15:09.24]Fucking Satan face.
[15:21.83]What character do I play as?
[15:24.17]There's too many people in this game.
[15:32.72]Hey, Hannah.
[15:38.83]Alright.
[15:48.10]Oh, that's the bad guy.
[15:50.06]The bad guy is the guy with the axe.
[15:58.83]Do I have to walk around?
[16:00.93]Yep, I get to finally take control of the first character.
[16:03.25]Alright, let's run.
[16:08.29]R2.
[16:09.19]Nice jump scares, by the way, guys.
[16:10.35]Glad I have a face cam on.
[16:14.43]Everyone's, like, drunk.
[16:15.29]Everyone drank way too many fucking root beers.
[16:18.11]Are they supposed to be... How old are they supposed to be?
[16:19.53]Like, 20?
[16:20.13]I love she's looking around like this place is, like, a fucking mess.
[16:27.84]Use the right stick to look around.
[16:29.02]Objects that glint can be inspected.
[16:30.70]Okay.
[16:31.82]I mean this.
[16:33.78]Press R2 to pick up the bottle.
[16:37.75]And then fucking smash over on this guy's head.
[16:39.89]Okay, hold R. Okay, so you can spin stuff around.
[16:44.66]Jeremiah Crag.
[16:47.04]Okay.
[16:48.32]He's drinking the hard stuff.
[16:51.48]Glasses.
[16:52.42]Oh, okay, so that's it.
[17:04.13]Oh, I gotta watch out for the guy that's... There's gonna be, like, a bad guy that's gonna break down the door.
[17:08.04]It's very obvious.
[17:09.74]Wait, something else.
[17:12.50]A note?
[17:16.22]And then... Oh, how do I turn the note?
[17:19.40]Oh, there we go.
[17:21.45]You look so damn hot in that shirt, but I bet you're even hotter out of it.
[17:25.33]Come to the guest... at 2 a.m.
[17:28.41]Mike.
[17:28.89]Triple X. That's a sexual term.
[17:32.69]Alright, what time is it?
[17:33.37]Oh my god.
[17:34.87]What did our naive sister get herself into now?
[17:39.25]L.A.
[17:39.57]Noire.
[17:40.01]I got your note.
[17:42.05]Glad you could make it.
[17:43.83]This guy's a fucking creep.
[17:48.78]Am I gonna get banned from Twitch TV right now?
[17:50.04]Maybe we should start with a little, you know, making out and see where it goes from there.
[18:00.22]Who says that?
[18:00.80]Nobody says that.
[18:02.02]Nobody says that.
[18:04.08]Oh, hell yeah.
[18:05.58]What?
[18:05.74]Okay.
[18:05.84]So she took off.
[18:30.32]So she's gone.
[18:30.82]Use the right stick to choose.
[18:36.81]Find the others or go wake Josh.
[18:41.19]Um.
[18:43.51]Fuck this guy.
[18:45.75]Wake Josh.
[18:46.84]No.
[18:49.52]Josh is useless right now.
[18:51.46]Everyone's like running away from me.
[18:54.75]Awake Josh.
[18:56.55]Why can I not say his name?
[18:57.35]What's going on?
[18:58.33]Where's my sister going?
[18:59.99]It's fine.
[19:00.73]She just can't take a joke.
[19:02.02]It was just a prank, Han.
[19:04.96]What did you do?
[19:05.76]We were just messing around, Beth.
[19:07.48]It wasn't serious.
[19:08.58]You jerk!
[19:10.36]What were we messing around with?
[19:12.54]I don't understand.
[19:13.28]So, should we go after her?
[19:15.96]Oh, no.
[19:16.22]Another choice.
[19:16.74]Choices matter.
[19:17.42]You're the last person she wants to see right now, Mike.
[19:21.43]Press the correct action button until the timer runs out.
[19:23.47]Oh, shit.
[19:32.24]Okay.
[19:33.70]Safe or fast?
[19:35.14]Safe, fast.
[19:36.72]Fast!
[19:39.55]Jump over that!
[19:42.05]Good job, nice jump!
[19:43.53]Keep going, faster!
[19:45.11]You can make it.
[19:48.87]Yup.
[19:51.11]This is a pretty good movie.
[19:53.75]Oh no, now where do we go?
[19:55.09]Left or right?
[19:56.16]Follow the noise or follow the footprints?
[19:57.72]Go to the noise.
[19:58.90]Go to the noise.
[20:00.22]Ow!
[20:03.45]Watch, I gotta climb up like a tree.
[20:04.51]Nice step over.
[20:05.27]That was a good quick time event.
[20:06.33]I just did that one.
[20:11.65]What the fuck?
[20:12.47]There are, like, a lot of choices.
[20:17.22]Follow the shadow.
[20:18.16]Follow the footprints.
[20:19.10]Follow the shadow.
[20:21.06]This person's definitely dead.
[20:22.10]I think I've killed this person.
[20:24.24]A first death.
[20:25.62]It's gonna be Purple Jacket Lady.
[20:32.56]Got it!
[20:32.86]Nice, quick time.
[20:38.04]Use the touchpad as shown.
[20:42.12]What?
[20:43.30]Can you like open up your phone?
[20:44.95]Oh god, here we go.
[20:46.01]You can direct the light beam with the right stick.
[20:50.95]Oh man.
[20:51.83]You gonna throw this like fucking wonky ass shit at me right now?
[20:54.59]I think I'm holding a candle.
[21:10.25]Didn't even jump scare me.
[21:11.33]Didn't even jump... Why do I even have the fucking facecam on?
[21:14.13]That didn't even do anything.
[21:16.63]A fucking goat ran by.
[21:18.08]Oh, funny, scary goat.
[21:19.40]Whatever.
[21:23.18]Just wait till I find... I'm gonna... I'm gonna survive.
[21:25.66]I'll make sure I do that.
[21:26.90]Pick up that rock.
[21:29.26]Oh, no, wait a minute.
[21:30.30]It's like a magic, like, tiki idol.
[21:33.43]Wait, it says triangle on it.
[21:35.31]It's a PlayStation tiki idol.
[21:37.57]They're extremely rare.
[21:39.69]Come on, pick it back up.
[21:40.75]No, pick it back up.
[21:41.49]I... Pick it back up.
[21:45.87]Turn it around.
[21:47.13]Like the tutorial told me.
[21:50.10]Okay.
[21:51.92]I just saw my own, like, death totem.
[21:56.04]It's a death totem.
[21:58.50]Let me look at that again.
[21:59.46]Wait a second.
[22:01.26]Death totem.
[22:02.06]It was R1.
[22:02.52]What?
[22:09.49]Black Death, the possible death of the person who finds it.
[22:13.31]Indigenous tribes believe that butterflies brought dreams and premonitions.
[22:16.43]Each totem piece foretells a possible future event.
[22:19.24]How you play will determine whether or not these prophecies come true.
[22:22.96]As you unlock totems, the events of the past will become clear.
[22:39.39]Oh wait, they have like all these... They have all these like... Okay.
[22:51.22]There's a lot here.
[22:51.98]I wanna... Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

[24:19.25]Same exact fucking scariness.
[24:23.33]Uh-oh, Jace is like, the fucking, the predator can see us now.

[27:24.53]Could you please pick up a card?
[27:26.37]Pick up a card.

[27:38.58]Yes, I will answer honestly.
[27:42.58]Okay.
[27:46.44]What is it?
[27:47.98]Okay, we've got a scarecrow with a barn, but the red barn signifies life.
[27:50.44]Meaning, scarecrow signifies solidifying and being stuck in life somewhere.
[27:55.28]The grass signifies flowness.
[27:56.96]Flowing.
[27:57.68]I know exactly how I feel.
[27:59.48]This is a new job.
[28:00.60]This is a new job on the horizon.

[28:04.97]So, how did that picture make you feel?
[28:09.95]Remember, be honest.
[28:13.63]Makes me uneasy.
[28:14.35]It's a new job.
[28:15.69]Okay.

[28:18.72]What do you think it is that makes you feel uneasy?
[28:22.58]Miss Clea.
[28:27.21]It's the scarecrow that makes you uneasy.
[28:28.65]Obviously.
[28:30.07]Well, I see.
[28:31.13]I see.
[28:32.29]Let's see.
[28:36.46]If the scarecrow wasn't there, would I stay there?
[28:45.20]No, I wouldn't.
[28:45.86]Because I don't know who the fuck could live there.
[28:47.06]There might be some kind of psycho that lives in that house.
[28:48.94]I don't know.
[28:55.48]It's a big house.
[28:56.64]It's a real big fucking place.
[28:58.66]There's a fine line between the peacefulness of solitude and the loneliness of isolation.
[29:02.82]Therapy simulator.
[29:04.28]I know, right?
[29:05.05]Perhaps this is something we can explore in the future.
[29:08.19]Hmm?
[29:11.21]Because I'm afraid we're out of time.
[29:14.31]I'm going to get, like, killed by a fucking scarecrow.
[29:16.37]All right, face cam's off.
[29:18.50]This guy's creepy?

[29:48.36]CookieCRM, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[29:50.62]But don't get more money when you use your video when you have an awful mic.
[29:56.80]Average video quality.
[30:00.49]It's a gameplay commentary for TF2.
[30:02.01]It's from 2013.
[30:02.35]And I used my old intro.
[30:04.17]Pretend I'm back in 2013.
[30:09.01]I mean, that would be, like, kind of funny.
[30:14.93]But I don't think I would do that.
[30:16.11]But thank you for the $10.
[30:17.61]Also, thank you to Crip World for $5.

[31:06.78]Fuck FaceCam.
[31:13.92]You don't need my shitty reaction in the lower right-hand corner of the screen.
[31:18.26]This isn't like a horror game.
[31:19.43]This is like a choose-your-own-adventure game.
[31:29.08]We're considering as a person of interest, but his whereabouts are currently unknown.
[31:32.90]He has an interesting history with the Washington family.
[31:35.52]He had warned them against pursuing their construction project and claimed the land was sacred to his forefathers.
[31:40.25]I just want to watch you.
[31:41.05]The other is still the old sanatorium on the mountain.
[31:43.21]Could he be hiding there?
[31:45.23]My officers did search the ground, but the girls themselves couldn't have made it that far.
[31:49.70]Something about that mountain seems to breed tragic events.
[31:53.66]Do you want to know the honest-to-God truth right now, guys?
[31:56.59]Alright, here's the honest to God truth.
[31:58.99]So it is like... I'm turning the lights off because there is no air conditioning in this room down here and it's like fucking 90 degrees in the room.

[40:12.41]Okay, can you hear me?
[40:15.95]No, when did it cut off?
[40:17.38]What's the last thing you guys heard?
[40:19.64]That was really odd.
[40:20.40]Okay, well hopefully it doesn't happen again.
[40:22.96]Let's go.
[40:25.01]Haunted.

[41:47.34]I was buzzing.
[41:49.46]Cool, well, thanks for letting me know.
[41:51.56]I can take it from here.
[41:55.82]Murderer.
[41:56.16]That's the murderer.
[41:58.38]You can tell because he's got glasses.
[42:01.98]Wait, why does that matter?
[42:02.80]I don't know about that.

[42:27.31]Turn on facecam and stop being insecure.
[42:30.67]It's not an insecure thing, it's just like it doesn't add anything right now.
[42:34.21]I'm just like walking around.
[42:35.17]I'm very much a proponent of things adding to the media.
[42:40.74]You know, the art.
[42:43.27]What did I miss?
[42:43.67]I'm like over here looking to chat.
[42:46.67]I don't like the fact that there's a gun around here.
[42:50.57]Didn't I just do this yesterday on the last stream?
[42:51.97]Yeah.
[43:14.16]What?
[43:15.66]You're gonna make me aim with the right stick?

[43:46.19]Oh, this guy.
[43:46.69]First opportunity, this guy dies.
[43:48.65]Literally the first opportunity, like this guy's going down the well.
[43:51.15]I really do have to shoot this girl.
[43:52.11]I'm not doing it.
[44:08.14]No.
[44:09.04]This girl wants me to... First chance, this girl's dead too.
[44:13.82]First you got this weird, douchey guy.
[44:18.46]And this girl that wants me to kill animals.
[44:20.78]First chance, you're both dead.

[44:54.10]Any of your business.
[44:58.33]Sam looked at Chris's incoming message.
[45:00.27]Chris was offended by Sam's indiscretion.
[45:07.89]Okay.
[45:09.81]Rats with bushy tails.
[45:10.91]Chris chose not to shoot the squirrel.
[45:12.67]Nature remained in balance.
[45:14.37]Wait, what?
[45:18.11]Okay.
[45:20.63]Yeah, you didn't shoot that squirrel.

[46:11.56]Looks like someone thought so.
[46:13.88]Oh, come on.
[46:14.50]This place is abandoned most of the year.
[46:15.88]Nobody comes up here.
[46:16.92]Mm-hmm.
[46:20.64]What am I doing?
[46:21.30]What am I doing with my hands?
[46:22.34]That's weird.
[46:23.52]Door's locked.
[46:23.88]I was just, like, shaking my hands.
[46:25.94]Josh wanted us to keep it locked to keep people out.
[46:28.60]He said that?
[46:29.46]What people?
[46:31.27]I don't know.
[46:32.23]He said they found people sleeping in the station one time.
[46:34.81]Creepy.
[46:35.89]Okay.
[46:37.94]So we just climb in the window?
[46:39.62]Or do I have like a key or something?
[46:46.30]Wait, I thought they said the door was locked.
[46:50.44]What?
[46:54.31]How did we just get in?
[46:57.05]Did I have a key?
[47:01.77]No, it's beautiful.
[47:07.55]Cool.
[47:09.27]They used a key on the locked door.
[47:11.19]You just showed the key.
[47:12.89]You just saw him waving a key.
[47:15.28]No, I didn't.
[47:16.96]Hotel and sanatorium.
[47:19.72]That's like such a fucking creepy name for anything.
[47:26.13]I don't want to look at this anymore.
[47:28.09]Stop looking at chat.
[47:30.33]I'm sorry.
[47:39.51]And anything else?
[47:40.27]Got a laptop over here.
[47:41.33]We got some CRT TV with a nice sink.
[47:48.18]Just saw a guy.
[47:48.86]Is that the problem?
[47:51.42]Hmm.
[47:58.05]Yeah, I need more clues.
[48:08.72]Not really.
[48:10.18]Put on sub mode for the spoilers?
[48:13.78]Uh, no, that's alright.
[48:14.96]Like, look, I know like a bunch of fucking people die.
[48:18.44]But, like, just don't, just don't do it.
[48:20.37]Like, if you told me, oh, hey, World Entry, but people die in Until Dawn.
[48:25.57]Oh, this person's gonna die.
[48:27.03]Like, everybody's gonna fucking, like, die.
[48:28.93]Everyone has a chance to die.
[48:29.95]There's, like, 5,000 endings.
[48:32.11]So, that's okay.
[48:34.38]Just, like, go into the prom.
[48:40.64]Here we go.
[48:41.86]Great.
[48:42.12]Adventure begins.
[48:43.98]Alright, let's get up there.
[48:44.74]This was the right thing to do.
[48:46.36]What?
[48:47.58]You know, good.
[48:47.92]People die when they are killed.
[48:48.78]Everyone together on the anniversary.
[48:50.32]I mean, Josh seemed really pumped about us all doing something, didn't he?
[48:55.18]Yeah, no, he definitely did.
[48:56.68]I haven't seen him so excited about something like this in forever.
[48:59.50]He's way too animated.
[49:01.02]Good, good.
[49:02.20]It's hard to tell with him, and I don't know, I've kind of been interested.
[49:05.54]It's a roguelike.
[49:06.12]No, no, it was a good idea.
[49:08.25]I hope everyone else feels the same way.
[49:10.99]We're all here, aren't we?
[49:12.93]Thanks, bro.
[49:14.07]Thanks, bro.
[49:14.41]Good talk.
[49:17.80]You know what?
[49:18.16]Let's just stop talking about what happened and enjoy the trip.
[49:20.82]You know what?
[49:22.28]You're right.
[49:23.50]You know how Josh and I met?
[49:25.58]No.
[49:25.76]Okay.
[49:26.90]Third grade.
[49:28.30]Josh sat in the back of the room.
[49:29.78]I sat in the front.
[49:31.49]We didn't even know each other existed.
[49:33.73]But the kids sitting next to Josh started strap-snapping the training broad in front of him.
[49:38.59]So the teacher made him move to the front, where I was sitting.
[49:42.81]Okay, so?
[49:44.03]So I got moved to the back.
[49:45.89]So we're just watching the movie.
[49:47.89]Enjoy the movie for like fucking two or three hours.
[49:50.55]We became friends to this day.
[49:52.75]A match made in heaven.
[49:54.43]If it weren't for the fact that Jeannie Simmons hit puberty like three years early and that day decided to wear a low-cut shirt that showed off her training bra, I mean, who knows?
[50:05.33]You could be riding in this cable car alone.
[50:08.13]It's like 35.
[50:08.71]What the fuck is he talking about?
[50:10.05]Or talking to some other person entirely.
[50:12.53]Boom.
[50:13.93]Butterfly effect.
[50:15.91]Well, he just said it, but like dude's talking about all this creepy shit.
[50:20.36]This dude's like 36.
[50:20.78]Okay, there's another new character introduction.
[50:33.34]Jess.
[50:37.48]Jess does not take photos well.
[50:40.32]Does not take photos well.
[50:41.58]Confident, trusting...
[50:47.69]Not photo... Not photogenic.
[50:52.25]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[50:54.03]New people.
[50:54.73]Time to meet and greet.
[50:56.45]So they're coming up on cable cars, and now I take control of Jessica.
[50:59.76]Okay.
[51:07.30]Nobody has a run animation.
[51:08.66]That's very concerning to me.
[51:12.81]I'm so steaming mad, I just walked around the car for a second.
[51:19.00]Jessica, over here!
[51:20.18]Are you guys having a really weird stroke?
[51:23.97]We're stuck in this stupid thing.
[51:25.65]Can you please let us out?
[51:27.31]Pretty please?
[51:32.55]Can I not do it?
[51:37.65]What if I just don't do it?
[51:48.91]I needed to take a long time to process that one, apparently.
[51:53.27]Oh my god.
[51:55.45]I thought we were goners.
[51:56.59]Another ten minutes in there and I would have chewed off my own leg.
[52:00.39]That's foreshadowing.
[52:01.79]He's going to chew his own leg off in 25 minutes.
[52:04.63]Yeah, right.
[52:07.71]Hey, Chris.
[52:09.47]I'm just doing like Sam taught me.
[52:11.25]Other people's private thoughts are my own personal playground.
[52:15.49]Do not be a jerk.
[52:17.18]My goodness.
[52:19.26]Seems that someone has a little crush on our good friend and dear class president Michael Monroe.
[52:25.68]And what kind of sizzling erotica might our Jessica be capable of imagining?
[52:30.50]I wonder.
[52:34.73]Give that back, you motherfucker.
[52:36.93]Give that back, you tool.
[52:38.37]Tool and die.
[52:40.03]That's my motto.
[52:41.22]You're such an idiot.
[52:42.72]Maybe nosy Nancy shouldn't go nosing around in other people's nostrils.
[52:48.22]Uh, yeah, I try not to do that, as a rule.
[52:51.01]Come on, Jess, you can tell us.
[52:52.43]Kill him.
[52:54.33]Everyone wants his blood.
[52:55.45]Whatever.
[52:56.49]You'll figure it out eventually.
[52:57.61]Well, look, the first time I get, like, the hit circle in five seconds, I'm just gonna let him tumble down the hill.
[53:04.02]You guys go ahead.
[53:05.24]I'm just gonna wait here for a bit.
[53:07.72]See who else is coming.
[53:09.90]You mean Mike?
[53:10.98]What?
[53:12.80]I mean, you know, whoever.
[53:15.40]Uh-huh.
[53:16.54]Sam?
[53:18.88]Did you see this view?
[53:20.62]I mean, holy cow.
[53:21.46]I mean, that's very clearly... Sometimes I forget.
[53:25.62]Uh, okay.
[53:27.46]Well, that was odd.
[53:33.16]Well, fellas and females...
[53:39.32]Guys and gals, that was a blue screen of death.
[53:45.68]That was interesting, I guess.
[53:50.52]Sorry about that.
[53:51.65]That's unfortunate.
[53:55.51]Let me just pull a few things back here.
[54:00.45]Hopefully that doesn't happen again.
[54:06.66]What was the last thing that happened?
[54:09.32]Because I looked over and I was just like, I have no idea what the fuck just happened.
[54:16.37]That's kind of a scary thing.
[54:24.89]Okay.
[54:26.51]Well.
[54:28.39]Give me one second while I get my shit back together.
[54:39.20]It was all the squirrel.
[54:48.57]Well, if that happens again, I'm going to be very angry.
[54:50.39]Let me just make a little tweet saying that things are back to normal-ish, hopefully.
[54:58.42]It was a DPC watchdog violation.
[55:02.44]Whatever that means.
[55:04.23]Fucking watchdogs.
[55:05.95]I saw that and I just, like, laughed.
[55:07.23]I was like, like, really?
[55:08.17]Like, fucking watchdogs?
[55:10.95]You're gonna, like, haunt me, Ubisoft?
[55:20.74]Alright, let's, uh, get fucking... Let me just fucking hold on.
[55:25.14]Give me one second.
[55:26.83]I really hope that doesn't happen again.
[55:49.67]Sorry for that.
[55:52.94]And... Okay.
[55:57.18]That's a hard drive error, I'm pretty sure.
[55:59.02]A hard drive?
[55:59.54]These are all brand new.
[56:01.06]That would be really fucking irritating.
[56:04.24]Let's get back into it.
[56:07.70]Uh, so, uh, did you guys see this person?
[56:11.56]I mean, he just, like, smiled into the camera.
[56:16.88]Oh, what does he do if I don't move?
[56:25.04]Yeah, okay, I'm gonna have, I'm gonna, like, keep my hands off of my, like, computer over here.
[56:34.79]I'm just gonna keep it like that.
[56:37.23]I'm not gonna touch any buttons over here anymore.
[56:41.38]Okay, so we got introduced to two more characters.
[56:45.80]This guy's the new character.
[56:46.78]It said, uh... It said... Well, that's unfortunate, because you missed a really funny joke with this guy.
[56:55.21]You missed, like, two funny jokes in a row.
[56:56.93]Funniest jokes of the night, by the way.
[56:58.53]Oh.
[56:58.95]Yeah.
[57:02.55]Hey, it's Mike That like fucking scared me and I wasn't even like I wasn't even ready to do the joke
[57:24.31]Uh, yeah, yeah, we remember this guy.
[57:25.69]This is the guy that doesn't die by the bird.
[57:28.19]Michael, you're a jerk.
[57:29.39]Michael, you're a jerk.
[57:44.22]Should've had face cam on.
[57:46.30]I'm like afraid to touch my computer now because I just had a fucking Watch Dogs 2 violation.
[57:50.86]Don't be like that.
[57:51.96]Like what?
[57:53.06]The way you're being.
[57:54.20]You always get like this.
[58:00.22]Fucking threaten him.
[58:02.21]Michael, you gotta step off.
[58:05.09]Emily and I are together now and that's just the way it is.
[58:07.85]I'm not gonna tell you again.
[58:12.06]Whoa, bro!
[58:12.34]Step off.
[58:12.68]Alright, so what?
[58:14.84]Is everybody like an ex-boyfriend or an ex-girlfriend of somebody else here?
[58:35.99]What?
[58:36.85]Hey, could you take these the rest of the way?
[58:39.49]You know what I mean?
[58:40.35]Isn't that a little odd?
[58:42.21]All the bags.
[58:43.95]Why?
[58:45.48]I need to go find Sam.
[58:48.24]Yes.
[58:48.98]Sorry, I really need to go find her.
[58:50.84]I totally forgot I needed to talk to her before we get all the way up there.
[58:53.88]I just really can't wait.
[58:55.28]We're almost there.
[58:56.30]It's important.
[58:57.49]Matt, please.
[59:03.11]Uh... Hmm...
[59:06.98]Okay, go bring the bags or I'm not going to leave you alone.
[59:11.25]Yeah.
[59:12.83]No, you know what?
[59:13.75]Fuck that.
[59:14.33]No.
[59:16.07]She just told me she liked the alpha male thing.
[59:18.51]I'm going to be like, no, I'm coming.
[59:20.71]It's cold out and it's getting dark.
[59:23.13]You're going to protect me from it being dark out?
[59:25.81]Yes.
[59:28.55]Nobody's gonna steal it.
[59:29.79]Matt, are you kidding me?
[59:31.25]You can't leave me alone for five minutes?
[59:33.27]You really think that little of me?
[59:34.71]That's not what I meant.
[59:35.63]Why can't you just listen to me?
[59:37.11]It's like cold and dark and scary.
[59:39.14]I'm sorry.
[59:40.12]I'm just trying to be helpful.
[59:41.82]If you want to be helpful, then you can help get everything up to the law just quickly as you can, okay?
[59:46.20]Okay.
[59:50.46]Fine.
[59:51.76]Whatever you want.
[59:53.54]Thank you.
[59:54.60]I'll see you up there after I go find Sam.
[59:56.22]See you in a bit.
[59:57.49]This is like wow They come on man.
[60:01.45]You didn't you couldn't just like Turn around a good top.
[60:04.99]Can I turn around and walk that way choices matter?
[60:14.58]What is that device?
[60:17.21]Another one, Ashley has a crush on Chris.
[60:22.39]Academic, inquisitive, forthright.
[60:25.24]Everybody wants to bang everybody.
[60:28.98]Welcome to In Tilt On.
[60:34.90]She has a crush on Chris.
[60:36.38]Chris has a crush on Natalie.
[60:39.14]Natalie is dating Chris's ex-boyfriend.
[60:42.48]Chris's ex-boyfriend doesn't like Chris's new friend, Emily, who currently has a crush on Michael, who Michael is Natalie's brother.
[60:53.85]You understand?
[60:54.67]Oh, no!
[61:04.27]I swear to God, I'm gonna zoom in.
[61:05.91]Gonna be something like, I'm gonna get jumpscared.
[61:28.97]Okay, no, we're not doing that again.
[61:31.07]Hey, got that face cam scare for you guys.
[61:32.81]Uh, you know, fine.
[61:33.61]Take a look.
[61:34.45]Take a look.
[61:34.85]Let's bust him.
[61:57.30]Let's bust him.
[61:58.12]Yep.
[61:58.38]I want this guy to make it to the end.
[62:01.80]What the fuck did this guy do to deserve that shit?
[62:07.12]What's that guy's name?
[62:29.32]Jeff, Jeffrey?
[62:30.04]I don't remember.
[62:40.05]Read book, check phone.
[62:42.19]What a decision.
[62:44.11]Or go to the bathroom because you clearly have to.
[62:50.45]Uh, you know, we're gonna... Fuck the technology bullshit.
[62:53.51]We're gonna step back.
[62:54.67]We're gonna read a book.
[62:56.29]Everybody's always on their fucking phones.
[62:58.21]Like, put your fucking phone down for a minute.
[63:01.54]You know what I mean?
[63:02.06]Oh.
[63:05.76]I hate this guy.
[63:12.23]What choice do I, a supple young rebel girl, have but to surrender to the strapping
[63:20.36]I hope I get a snowball right in the face.
[63:23.76]Alright, I'm throwing a snowball at him.
[63:29.86]In the head.
[63:30.54]Got him, right in the face.
[63:41.23]Oh, hee hee.
[63:45.41]Here comes the copy, here comes the copyrighted music.
[63:56.40]Ooh, just barely.
[63:57.68]There's the bird.
[64:00.80]Wait a minute.
[64:02.18]This is the butterfly of the definition.
[64:04.24]What do I have to do with the bird?
[64:05.90]The bird?
[64:08.33]Um.
[64:11.01]Something to do with the bird.
[64:12.67]I don't know.
[64:21.70]Something doing- Sometimes doing nothing is the right thing to do.
[64:24.88]Alright, remember this.
[64:30.96]Don't hit the bird, right?
[64:31.76]Cause the bird has to like, warn him.
[64:37.13]Right?
[64:37.33]Alright, now hit him right in the fucking mouth.
[64:43.97]This- We have to restore balance to the bird force.
[64:48.65]Right?
[64:50.91]He's gonna get an axe in the head.
[64:55.08]Use the corner gun.
[64:56.64]Okay, that sounds vaguely dirty.
[64:57.44]Why does everybody talk like that?
[65:21.65]Kiss him!
[65:25.13]Look, I'm so confused at this point, I don't even know what the relationships are.
[65:30.51]Like, I'm so confused.
[65:32.13]Who are these two people again, and who do they care about?
[65:34.01]Should've grabbed the snowball.
[65:52.84]Alright, so what did that do for me?
[66:04.35]I don't know.
[66:05.89]We got some updates.
[66:06.51]Let's take a look at these status updates.
[66:09.53]Go to the butterfly effect.
[66:12.09]The soul of discretion.
[66:14.32]Yeah, Matt saw Mike and Emily flirting.
[66:17.26]Yep.
[66:18.76]Any of your business.
[66:19.84]Sam looked at Chris's incoming message.
[66:21.18]Chris was not happy about that.
[66:24.70]Chris was offended.
[66:25.74]And then she got criticized.
[66:29.04]And that's when the axe went into the back of his head.
[66:32.26]Okay, let's go.
[66:34.36]Welcome to the next boxcar.
[66:39.64]With more people.
[66:43.62]No, no, we're back at, like, the psychologist's office.
[66:46.24]Take a look at this.
[66:47.58]I want you to tell me if you think that this is going to be a mental image for you.
[66:53.54]Why did you kill all these people?
[66:56.22]Take a look at this.
[66:57.98]Did you have some breakfast?
[67:00.98]This time...
[67:11.17]We're going to try to understand the root of your anxiety.
[67:14.52]Now pick up that book.
[67:19.20]You will see a set of pictures and symbols.
[67:21.60]I want you to identify which image in each set makes you the most anxious.
[67:27.30]Okay, which set makes me the most anxious?
[67:32.70]Women worry me, men worry me.
[67:36.58]This is a loaded question.
[67:39.38]Because on one hand, like, obviously, like, you know, women, I'm attracted to, like, women.
[67:44.42]And over the course of my life, you know, it's been a sense of worry and contention.
[67:47.90]Like, oh, does this girl like me?
[67:49.43]Am I doing enough for my girlfriends?
[67:52.47]I think I might be in love.
[67:54.99]I don't know.
[67:55.25]Does this person like me?
[67:55.97]I have to look good.
[67:57.55]But on the other hand, men.
[67:59.19]Men worry me as well.
[68:01.49]I remember being in the locker room and understanding that, like, I was not up to snuff.
[68:06.92]I was a little shorter.
[68:08.42]And sometimes I would get picked on by these other men.
[68:14.84]I'm not sure.
[68:15.72]And also still, there might be a more successful handsome bearded man that I might run into and I'm going to be very, very concerned by him.
[68:24.63]Because who knows?
[68:25.67]If he's dressed like that, I'm going to be very intimidated.
[68:27.57]Men worry me.
[68:33.69]What's the next one?
[68:36.76]Crowds scare me or planes scare me?
[68:39.44]Planes don't scare me.
[68:40.88]Excuse me.
[68:41.38]Let's just go over this.
[68:42.14]Fucking innovation.
[68:44.02]Human fucking innovation versus scary people I don't know?
[68:48.12]Every time.
[68:53.59]I fear heights or I fear drowning.
[68:57.85]Is there a both option?
[69:03.70]No, you know what?
[69:04.18]I don't feel... Honestly, like, nah.
[69:07.86]Because, I mean, the Loch Ness Monster, it was obviously a hoax.
[69:11.01]It was a guy putting his hand... Like, that's the Loch Ness Monster hoax.
[69:13.37]I don't know why that doesn't scare me.
[69:15.03]I'm definitely more scared of being up high than I am of the Loch Ness Monster.
[69:17.55]Because it turned out to be fake.
[69:20.33]Oh, excuse me!
[69:23.01]I don't even care what the other animal is!
[69:29.21]How dare you put a fucking rat on here?
[69:31.89]gun or a knife knives of like knives are scarier than like didn't um what's the the joker heath ledger's joker explained by knives are scarier than guns and if you need the clip you can go ahead and go watch it on your own time but like the knives are scarier than guns that's just the way it is just watch the dark knight and you'll know why
[69:56.27]Uh, bugs or snakes?
[69:58.53]All right, well, if you put these side by side, cockroaches are gross.
[70:04.11]Snakes aren't really that, but snakes are fucking just reptiles with no arms and legs.
[70:08.62]All a snake is is a really long, dachshund salamander.
[70:12.40]Cockroaches.
[70:15.26]The snake is the dachshund of the reptiles.
[70:17.23]Like, it's not a big deal.
[70:23.04]Uh, clowns, uh, scarecrows.
[70:24.72]Scarecrows don't scare me.
[70:25.94]I mean, that clown... That clown is scary.
[70:34.41]Uh... I mean... I mean, that clown is fucking terrifying.
[70:38.31]Like, that scarecrow is just a shitty sack on somebody's head.
[70:40.59]Not a big deal.
[70:42.33]Literally Batman.
[70:43.77]Apparently I'm, like, scared of the Joker.
[70:48.94]Alright.
[70:50.20]Gore versus crows.
[70:53.22]Let me ask you something.
[70:54.96]Do you think blood and guts and intestines being ripped out of people is worse than crows?
[71:03.29]Are you fucking serious?
[71:06.03]What an easy question.
[71:07.79]Oh.
[71:09.72]Did I startle you?
[71:10.50]No, you didn't.
[71:10.98]I'm sorry.
[71:12.68]You're doing very well.
[71:15.38]Don't be nervous.
[71:19.34]Crows are scary?
[71:20.12]No, the crows are not scary.
[71:21.68]Try it to you.
[71:23.33]Speed up a bit.
[71:24.30]The more you rely on your instincts, the more honest your answers will be, and the more enlightening you will find this experience.
[71:30.94]Okay.
[71:31.12]That's what we have to do.
[71:33.40]We have to do it fast.
[71:34.80]Spiders versus, I fear, cockroaches or spiders.
[71:37.36]Spiders are fucking creepy.
[71:40.08]They just are.
[71:40.80]Everybody knows it.
[71:41.76]Why am I wearing black OJ gloves?
[71:44.53]Needles and gore.
[71:45.97]Needles.
[71:46.77]Needles.
[71:47.31]No.
[71:47.57]I don't know.
[71:51.74]Is this like the OJ Simpson trial?
[71:54.30]Am I sitting here as OJ?
[71:57.93]Is this like the pre-trial psychological evaluation?
[72:02.47]Hey, OJ, what's scarier?
[72:05.77]Fucking needles.
[72:06.47]Needles are scary.
[72:09.72]That took way too much time.
[72:12.88]Oh god, go, go, go.
[72:14.80]Uh, zombie clowns.
[72:19.38]Go.

[73:15.62]Seriously.

[74:18.08]Complex, thoughtful, and loving.
[74:19.62]Yes, I am.
[74:42.96]Thoughtful.
[74:43.22]I should change the channel?
[74:44.50]We keep adding characters.
[74:46.20]Okay, I'm late.
[74:48.75]Short.
[74:48.91]Idiot.
[74:49.15]That would be so funny.

[75:23.68]Let's do some gossiping.
[75:30.03]Let's really get the ball rolling here.
[75:31.23]This guy's definitely the stoner.
[75:44.37]What else?
[75:45.69]Maybe there's another way in.
[75:47.13]There are a million ways in.
[75:48.19]There's a lot.
[75:49.51]Let's drain a bowl, man.
[75:52.23]Let's drain a bone.
[75:53.51]Wait a second.
[75:54.53]Are you saying we should break in?
[75:57.32]I don't think it's technically breaking in if you own the place, right?
[75:59.98]Hey.
[76:00.88]Not if I don't report you.
[76:02.90]All right, let's break in.
[76:04.18]Lead the way, coachees.
[76:13.25]Hey, Ash.
[76:14.19]Hi, Chris.
[76:21.89]So, how are you doing?
[76:24.59]Good.
[76:25.68]Oh, God.
[76:26.58]I think I could use some time crawled up by the fire.
[76:29.78]Yeah, that does sound pretty nice.
[76:38.85]Where am I going?
[76:45.63]I want to get into this.
[76:46.73]It's cold outside.
[76:48.39]I can't do anything.
[76:51.55]Drain the bone.
[76:52.90]That's not... Pay attention.
[76:55.76]I am paying attention, Banshees.
[76:57.78]See, I know that was your fucking name.
[76:59.18]I remember your name.
[77:00.26]You said that.
[77:06.42]No, I'm laughing because I fucking said something stupid.
[77:11.58]You stop it immediately!
[77:25.23]I ain't being on the bus with Trump.
[77:30.81]I'm stopping that conversation right now.
[77:33.02]I ain't getting on audio.
[77:36.02]I'm not going to be Billy Bush in this situation.
[77:37.90]No, I'm stopping that right now.
[77:38.94]You got any fucking tapes around here?
[77:40.20]You got any cameras recording us?
[77:41.82]Cut it out.
[77:42.30]Yeah.
[77:54.35]You come in for the kill.
[77:59.77]I don't know.
[78:00.51]I don't know.
[78:01.61]I don't know, man.
[78:02.83]How can you not know?
[78:04.11]What if it's, like, weird?
[78:05.89]What if she... She might, like, want to be friends with me anymore if I try something like that.
[78:10.02]I mean, weren't you just listening?
[78:11.44]You got to buck up, bro.
[78:12.60]Slow it down.
[78:19.16]We're talking political humor here.
[78:21.10]I'm planning on breaking into my parents' lodge, bud.
[78:24.87]Alright, we got an update.
[78:25.95]Let's see.
[78:31.50]I gotta get some more totem poles.
[78:33.02]Stop it, Trump!
[78:34.24]Stop saying this!
[78:34.96]I don't want to be recorded!
[78:36.60]Look, see, you can't say that anymore.
[78:37.86]See, he stopped.
[78:54.88]Wrong way?
[78:55.42]Fuck.
[79:00.92]I'm not gonna lose my Inside Edition job because of this.
[79:03.83]I should've turned off my GPS.
[79:07.82]You got an app?
[79:09.40]You got an app for that?
[79:10.70]There's like a missing axe.
[79:11.98]Obviously that's pretty important.
[79:37.09]Clue found.
[79:37.87]Axe holder.
[79:38.47]Yes.
[79:39.17]There's no axe there.
[79:40.07]A wall-mounted holder that should contain an axe, but the axe is missing.
[79:44.60]Yes.
[79:51.72]Uh... What about this?
[79:55.20]Well, well, well.
[79:56.04]We got ourselves a thinker.
[79:57.32]Nice one.
[80:07.82]I've seen so many clues.
[80:09.88]Well, I want to go on instinct.
[80:12.21]You know what I mean?
[80:13.85]I'm an instinctual person, right?
[80:16.55]If somebody... You know, you got like this bullshit called evidence and clues.
[80:22.15]No, no, no.
[80:22.67]Get all these people in the room and let me fucking look at them.
[80:24.85]And let me look at them like upside down.
[80:26.31]And let me just like see what they... When I talk to them, how they react to certain things.
[80:32.19]Boom.
[80:32.83]Got you killer.
[80:33.87]I'm okay.
[80:35.75]Got this thing called fucking clues and evidence.
[80:37.37]No, I read these people.
[80:38.85]I already know who... I already know who did it, guys.
[80:40.81]Just not gonna say it because I don't want to ruin the whole movie.
[80:45.07]He threw like a gun.
[80:49.49]Okay.
[80:59.52]Whoa, Chris, I just got an awesome idea.
[81:02.06]Yeah?
[81:02.80]Totally.
[81:04.02]What is it?
[81:04.68]Okay, so I'm pretty sure that I've got some deodorant in one of the bathrooms.
[81:09.45]You could use that with the lighter.
[81:11.91]I don't follow.
[81:12.53]How's a stick of deodorant going to help?
[81:14.47]Spray on.
[81:15.07]It's a can.
[81:17.07]Oh, yeah.
[81:18.17]Is he telling me to engulf myself in flames?
[81:20.63]Just like we did with the little army dudes.
[81:22.35]Yep.
[81:23.11]Once we melt it, just point the spray can in the lighter and
[81:27.34]That was not a good John Wayne, I'm insulted.
[81:30.94]You wanna hear a good John Wayne, I'll give you a John Wayne.
[81:34.74]Not right now though, it's gotta fucking make sense.
[81:38.28]I gotta do something cool first.
[81:54.70]Okay, let's look at... Let's actually look for clues.
[81:56.88]I see a clue down here.
[81:57.82]I got a raging clue.
[82:01.53]Let's see.
[82:02.29]It's one of those... It's one of those things you put your eyes up to and you see how you die.
[82:06.33]Alright, there it is.
[82:07.09]It's an explosion with fire.
[82:13.21]Loss.
[82:14.76]Potential loss of a friend.
[82:17.14]Found in the Mossman Lodge by Chris.
[82:18.66]So that's... Who is that?
[82:20.38]I don't know.
[82:22.22]It's one of the girls.
[82:28.64]Let's go over here.
[82:29.62]I can hear some rats.
[82:32.28]It's okay.
[82:33.10]Remember I told the psychologist rats do not scare me, so maybe they'll end up helping me.
[82:39.56]I just said I was scared of needles, and needles can't move around.
[82:42.56]They're not animals.
[82:46.56]Anything over here?
[82:52.19]Anything over this way?
[82:54.97]Hmm.
[83:00.95]No, nothing there.
[83:01.99]I just want to make sure I cover all the bases here.
[83:10.60]No, I'm just going to keep going.
[83:11.64]I wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything.
[83:17.00]Like this fucking aloe vera plant.
[83:20.14]If somebody gets hurt by a burn, I'll just take the fucking aloe vera and spread it around.
[83:25.96]Wait, what do you mean I missed something?
[83:27.08]What are you talking about?
[83:27.72]What?
[83:28.72]What?
[83:32.56]What did I miss?
[83:35.98]Where?
[83:36.88]What are you guys talking about?
[83:38.94]There's no, like, little glint on the ground.
[83:42.58]I already picked that up!
[83:45.43]I already did that!
[83:46.61]Stop it!
[83:47.13]Stop this!
[83:53.81]Stop this!
[83:57.21]It's Luigi's mansion.
[84:00.98]No, we're just going.
[84:01.76]I don't even care.
[84:02.58]I told you guys I'm gonna figure this out myself.
[84:05.10]I don't need evidence or clues.
[84:07.51]Huh.
[84:08.93]That's cool.
[84:10.45]What's cool?
[84:13.27]This is not cool.
[84:17.49]What's cool about this?
[84:19.80]It's a family portrait.
[84:23.64]Huh, that's cool.
[84:25.48]Cool.
[84:25.70]I didn't know that's what your mom and dad looked like.
[84:29.08]Cool.
[84:33.29]Oh, the Longhorns.
[84:35.92]I know that team.
[84:36.70]Cool.
[84:42.56]There comes the jump scare.
[84:46.15]Nope.
[84:47.41]Not yet.
[84:52.23]Oh, nice swanky.
[84:53.27]Swanky hotel room.
[84:55.39]Don't you guys love it when you book a hotel and you don't know anything about the hotel?
[84:59.32]You just know that it was fairly expensive.
[85:02.32]And you open up the door, you check in, you're excited to know what the room looks like.
[85:07.78]And you get in the room and the first thing you say is, ooh, swanky.
[85:11.89]I love that.
[85:12.41]And then you open up the fucking mattress and there's fucking bed bugs everywhere.
[85:27.07]Am I uploading this to YouTube?
[85:32.58]Oh, okay.
[85:37.90]You can't... It does not just open.
[85:42.08]Yeah, in every bed.
[85:45.30]Get the lock open.
[85:46.14]Alright, well... How do you suppose I do that, miss?
[85:53.76]To go, like, down here.
[85:55.02]Wait, was that a cigarette?
[86:01.06]I just did, like, that Simpsons thing.
[86:03.44]Like, Grandpa Simpson goes in the room, spins around, grabs his hat, and leaves.
[86:08.06]That was an M-E-M-E before, wasn't it?
[86:11.85]I've seen that.
[86:12.51]M-E-M-E.
[86:13.77]Hyphen.
[86:26.82]I don't even like that can of deodorant or something.
[86:31.90]What did he say it was?
[86:32.65]There's another picture.
[86:37.45]He's going to say cool.
[86:41.27]Prom night photo.
[86:43.03]She's got a butterfly tattoo.
[86:45.51]And there's ready for the senior prom.
[86:47.13]2013.
[86:48.18]Okay.
[86:48.54]Wait, who's she at the prom with?
[86:53.62]I don't know.
[86:53.98]Jason.
[86:54.70]Jason.
[86:59.02]Let's keep going clue we got some clues Like the girl with the butterfly tattoo on her arm is definitely like the catalyst right it's gonna be some weird thing where she got abducted by aliens And they gave her a fucking brain implant And she can like see the past I Don't know something like that.
[87:26.53]You know that's what's gonna happen.

[88:00.67]Nice.
[88:01.49]You picked up on that one.
[88:02.55]She can see the past.
[88:06.37]She can see the immediate past.
[88:10.15]Oh, that's so great.
[88:11.95]Yeah, everybody is a clairvoyant.
[88:13.59]You know that?
[88:15.06]We're all clairvoyants.
[88:16.12]We can all see the past.
[88:19.32]Up to a certain point while we've been alive.
[88:27.77]Oh man, I love Vader with a fucking... And you know what?
[88:30.94]You can like see in your own head too.
[88:33.72]Look how fucking crazy that is.
[88:35.66]If you sit there... Hold on.
[88:38.38]If you sit there and you close your eyes, and you think hard enough, you can like relive moments in your own head.
[88:49.38]Anybody else like fucking shocked and appalled at how insane that is?
[88:54.30]I can close my eyes and I can relive the rollercoaster that I went on like fucking two weeks ago.
[88:59.92]You can relive your own moments.
[89:02.39]How?
[89:03.95]Tiff.
[89:04.77]Checkmate, atheists.
[89:24.50]It's called a memory.
[89:25.30]Shut the fuck up with this pretentious bullshit.
[89:31.91]I'm just kidding!
[89:32.81]I don't fucking actually believe that.
[89:36.39]I believe that when we die, we rot in the ground as fucking worm food.
[89:39.73]You wanna, like, do you wanna come to me with, like, what I believe about, like, religious beliefs?
[89:47.80]We turn into skeletons, get eaten by bugs.
[89:50.86]That's what happens.
[89:54.37]Like, you know, that was a little too far.
[89:56.05]That was a little too far.
[89:56.95]Let me, um... That was a little too far.
[90:00.93]Uh, if you do believe in religion, like, I... You know, I'm a proponent of faith.
[90:06.39]Versus religion.
[90:07.03]Like, people can have faith.
[90:08.75]That's cool.
[90:09.51]I agree with that.
[90:10.12]That works.
[90:10.58]What am I doing, by the way?
[90:11.50]Why are we fucking talking about this?
[90:12.54]I need to find a can of spray.
[90:28.67]Hold on.
[90:28.93]Wait, wait, wait.
[90:29.45]I gotta retrace my steps.
[90:30.93]I gotta use my clairvoyant memory.
[90:32.51]I gotta use my clairvoyancy.
[90:35.81]This did take way too long.
[90:37.21]I just needed to go downstairs and we started talking about religion for no reason.
[90:40.56]Oh my fucking god.
[90:41.36]I gotta pay attention.
[90:42.54]My ADHD is on fucking 10 right now.
[90:52.83]I'm going back down here.
[91:05.34]Okay, let's see.
[91:07.70]This door can't... There's something here.
[91:08.92]This is the picture, right?
[91:10.64]No, it's another picture.
[91:16.39]Where's 13 Cape Cod Josh?
[91:18.45]With his lovely sisters, Hannah and Beth.
[91:20.15]Okay.
[91:28.90]Okay, I can't open this door, right?
[91:31.26]And I can't go in the cinema room, no.
[91:37.24]Okay.
[91:40.02]No, don't go up the stairs yet.
[91:41.30]Come over here.
[91:41.90]Just don't want to, like, miss any of this shit.
[91:46.81]Okay, there's another door.
[91:47.83]Can I open this one?
[91:49.97]No.
[91:53.65]Gold on the table.
[91:54.55]Alright, so now I'm confident.
[91:59.27]Well, not yet.
[91:59.73]This is the hardest part of the whole game.
[92:03.29]Is it...
[92:07.32]I heard that there's a point in the beginning, near the first hour, that just gets really annoying.
[92:13.65]Where it just doesn't need to be there.
[92:15.45]But then I heard the game really picks up and it's really fun and interesting, so let's go.
[92:22.23]Okay, back here.
[92:23.27]Let's go up.
[92:33.11]Everybody has hypothermia.
[92:37.10]Yeah, everyone's just been outside for a very long time.
[92:40.24]I'm just walking around.
[92:42.58]Okay, I've been walking around talking to myself as this guy about like religion.
[92:50.00]Dude, there's people freezing outside.
[92:52.01]Let me tell you something about faith.
[92:55.81]I truly think that religion, I don't agree with it, but I can respect it.
[93:00.69]Like, who are you talking to?
[93:09.82]Alright, we got... There we go.
[93:13.53]This is where I need to be.
[93:15.15]It's definitely right in here.
[93:17.69]There's gonna be... Okay, there's gonna be a fucking snake in here.
[93:20.89]You guys ready for the snake?
[93:22.48]Snake!
[93:23.72]Nope.
[93:24.24]No snake.
[93:27.84]There's not a snake in there!
[93:30.72]Get the fuck...
[93:34.28]What was that?
[93:35.74]What was that?
[93:36.32]I didn't go... I didn't take a psychology test about like a wolverine.
[93:44.98]What?
[93:45.68]We're freezing our buns off out here.
[93:51.78]Already dead.
[93:52.28]Gained one insight.
[93:59.33]We're good.
[94:00.68]Thank you.
[94:01.22]Thank you.
[94:01.52]Thank you.
[94:02.22]I'll be here all week.
[94:03.42]There he is again.
[94:04.48]What the fuck is that thing?
[94:06.72]That's not even a real animal.
[94:08.04]What was it?
[94:10.16]Are you okay?
[94:10.62]It was like a bear or a tiger or something.
[94:13.80]Clearly, that was not a tiger.
[94:15.15]That was an awful description.
[94:16.17]Don't worry, buddy.
[94:17.75]You're going to be a big boy soon.
[94:20.71]It was like a chupacabra.
[94:29.16]Well, it was a tiger, my dude.
[94:31.09]No, this is where it picks up.
[94:32.07]The lights are gonna turn off, someone's gonna be dead, and it's gonna be Clu.
[94:35.61]Oh, he's dead first.
[94:53.44]It's like, that's so Raven.
[94:56.68]That guy just had like a, that's so Raven moment.
[95:01.57]What the fuck was that?
[95:04.43]Like, are you kidding me?
[95:12.39]Stay, uh, do I challenge him?
[95:16.83]Yeah.
[95:17.79]Get fucking challenged.
[95:18.85]What?
[95:22.70]I saw you and M. At the telescope.
[95:25.92]Before?
[95:27.10]We just ran into each other.
[95:28.66]Been a while since I've seen him.
[95:29.78]You can't let me see the past.
[95:32.62]Hold on, that was just a memory.
[95:34.18]He was just having a memory.
[95:35.14]No, even the game.
[95:37.66]Everybody in this chat needs to calm down for a second.
[95:40.42]Because even this video game, that was a memory.
[95:44.03]But you see the super-powered look on his face.
[95:46.01]He's like, wham!
[95:47.45]We have superpowers as people.
[95:50.51]This game is just making that point even more clear.
[95:54.69]We're fucking... It's remarkable.
[95:56.39]It's powerful.
[95:59.81]Fuck you, Mike.
[96:02.62]Right.
[96:04.52]Right.
[96:04.86]I'm sure it's all it was.
[96:06.30]You know what?
[96:07.56]You can think whatever you want.
[96:09.26]It's a freak country.
[96:10.14]Watch yourself, Mike.
[96:19.01]I love this comment.
[96:19.73]We get it.
[96:20.17]We can remember shit.
[96:21.18]Play the fucking game.
[96:24.52]You must be new here.
[96:25.64]Oh my god.
[96:27.42]That is so gross.
[96:34.05]Are you trying to swallow his face whole?
[96:36.83]Seriously, can she be any more obvious?
[96:39.93]No one wants in on your territory, honey.
[96:42.55]Excuse me, did you say something?
[96:44.75]Oh, did you not hear me?
[96:46.33]Was your sluttiness too loud?
[96:47.91]Sounds like someone's bitter she didn't make the cut.
[96:50.61]Yeah, all of them.
[96:51.80]Big cattle call with that dream boat.
[96:53.58]Congrats, you're top cow.
[96:54.92]Cut's real deep calling Miss Homecoming a cow.
[97:01.51]Why am I making decisions with this guy?
[97:03.25]You're making everyone uncomfortable, Jess.
[97:05.68]Jealous much?
[97:06.94]Emily too frigid for you two.
[97:09.70]Oh, that's enough.
[97:10.70]On crack?
[97:38.94]Alright, I don't know what to do here.
[97:40.16]I love her for a painfully long time.
[97:45.94]He's just sitting here, like, biting his tongue.
[97:51.81]I've had enough.
[97:52.25]And then Mike's gonna stand up.
[97:53.59]Stop it!
[98:07.62]Yeah, let's go drain a bone.
[98:09.14]Everybody chill out.
[98:09.94]Whoa.
[98:35.83]Somebody stole my fucking bag.
[98:53.27]Oh my god, don't you remember next to the Italian shoe place where I got the stilettos and you knocked over the rack while you were drooling all over that girl at the counter?
[99:01.16]This guy can't catch a break.
[99:02.92]She was asking about my letter jacket.
[99:04.66]Right, because she gave a shit about your designer letter jacket.
[99:08.39]What the fuck?
[99:09.17]What's going on here?
[99:10.17]I need my bag.
[99:11.21]Oh my god, Em, maybe you just forgot it.
[99:13.45]Do you seriously think I'd forget my bag?
[99:15.33]Do you?
[99:18.33]This guy can't catch a break.
[99:21.45]He just wants to be a good person.
[99:22.69]What the fuck?
[99:24.91]Well, we have a second.
[99:26.65]No, we don't have a second.
[99:45.04]A-L-P.
[99:46.90]One letter off of ALF.
[99:48.22]That's too bad.
[99:49.74]Could have made a fucking ALF joke.
[99:51.74]In fact, I'm going to.
[99:53.92]I still am going to make an ALF joke.
[99:56.27]Because I'm already halfway down that road and I'm going to drive down it.
[100:01.19]How funny was Alf?
[100:02.71]He used to eat cats.
[100:03.45]What's up with that?
[100:04.31]Hey porn stars!
[100:21.20]God.
[100:21.40]50 cent joke.
[100:21.93]Foreshadowing.
[100:22.91]Remember that.
[100:23.47]Yeah.
[100:23.81]Alright.
[100:47.18]I think Josh was flirting with me.
[100:49.16]All right, let me just say, very quickly, a special thank you to Swamp Trooper Crodon, Gun Habber, Ill Jazz,
[101:03.49]Thank you for the three dollars.
[101:04.57]Hi Jeremy, I've been following you for five years and I want to say thank you for all you did.
[101:08.30]I've gone through several depressions and your videos helped me a lot.
[101:11.48]You're very smart and funny and I hope that you will continue to entertain people.
[101:14.22]Keep it up.
[101:14.62]I wish I could give you more.
[101:16.26]Well, that's extremely thoughtful of you.
[101:19.38]And like I've said this before, I better say it again.
[101:23.29]I'm fucking glad.
[101:24.41]I'm glad I can be something here for you to laugh at.
[101:27.53]And I'm very smart too.
[101:29.35]See?
[101:29.95]See?
[101:30.27]I'm very smart.
[101:32.11]See?
[101:32.31]See?
[101:33.04]Everyone thinks I'm so dumb.
[101:36.72]Thank you for sharing.
[101:38.54]That hits me in the chest there.
[101:41.38]Thank you for the $3.
[101:41.92]Also, Crodon gave $10.
[101:43.08]The psychiatrist is Satan from Constantine.
[101:47.58]Is he?
[101:49.54]Sprite37 gave $15.
[101:51.34]Thank you so much for making me laugh, dude.
[101:52.76]Your videos and streams have helped me through my stress and depression.
[101:56.08]Keep up the good work.
[101:56.70]Well, again... Again, guys, that's...
[102:04.37]That's like a huge reason why I do this.
[102:07.73]I like to hang out and have fun.
[102:10.40]And I hope you're having fun.
[102:14.84]I really hope so.
[102:18.22]Because I'm all about having fun.
[102:22.56]Hope you are.
[102:24.08]Much love.
[102:25.47]Let's keep going.
[102:28.25]I gave you depression.
[102:29.59]What?
[102:30.03]No, I didn't.
[102:32.56]Don't say that.
[102:34.16]Am I going to watch SGDQ?
[102:37.80]Of course I am.
[102:39.90]That is something I look forward to every summer and every winter.
[102:52.79]How do I zoom in?
[102:56.93]She's so ready for this picture and I'm not gonna take it But they just got really angry, did you see that?
[103:20.56]I gotta wait for the perfect moment
[103:23.79]Did I get it?
[103:24.73]Oh, god damn, I was trying to take it.
[103:26.89]I was trying to take it when they were both, like, fucking angry.
[103:30.17]They're trying so hard to be humans, they really are.
[103:32.19]Any clues?
[103:32.43]Not that I can see.
[103:53.85]Burr.
[103:56.03]Hey, guys, dialogue writing and, like, writing 101.
[104:01.80]If somebody's cold, don't ever add written dialogue for emotional distress.
[104:10.07]Or, like, a physical issue.
[104:12.45]Like, don't ever write, ow.
[104:13.35]Ow.
[104:14.61]Like fucking dialogue writing, like creative writing 101.
[104:17.71]If somebody, don't write burr if somebody's cold.
[104:19.67]Like we can, look at the actress.
[104:21.69]We already know she's cold and she can do that ad lib.
[104:23.83]You don't have to add that in dialogue.
[104:26.47]Same reason why you don't write ow.
[104:28.25]You don't write like oof.
[104:30.95]You don't have to write that.
[104:32.26]Stop, don't do that.
[104:34.50]That'll be $100 per person, by the way.
[104:38.68]That was, that's in this chat.
[104:41.06]Let's try the code.
[104:41.62]1, 2, 3.
[104:42.95]Guess this thing needs juice or something.
[104:45.23]Didn't Josh say there was a generator?
[104:47.22]No, they didn't.
[104:52.76]So he has to turn the generator on, but he can't do anything.
[104:58.59]What if I already knew that?
[104:59.43]Well, you're in my classroom.
[105:01.09]Wouldn't it be nice to fire up the Jenny and get moving?
[105:04.55]What's a Jenny?
[105:06.01]What's a Jenny?
[105:07.23]Hey!
[105:07.85]Hey!
[105:10.15]You're right next to me, but I'm yelling like you're five meters, five miles away.
[105:13.98]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[105:24.16]Private property, Washington State.
[105:27.03]I'm trying to light right in her face.
[105:33.65]Hold on.
[105:37.85]Can I get that flashlight?
[105:38.78]Where is she?
[105:40.66]Oh, come on.
[105:41.08]Look over here.
[105:41.68]Let me burn your retinas.
[105:42.62]I wish you could generate a little excitement about getting that freaking generator to work.
[105:49.72]Okay, I'll just yell at it like you're yelling at me.
[105:52.02]Let's see if that works.
[105:52.84]I'm having to turn the generator on.
[105:55.68]Wait, was it back there?
[105:56.50]I don't even understand.
[106:00.34]I thought the other guy had to turn the generator on, not me.
[106:04.48]Wait, wait, wait.
[106:05.40]What's going on?
[106:05.82]What happened?
[106:06.27]Comcast?
[106:06.53]What do you mean Comcast?
[106:11.41]What happened?
[106:13.41]What are you talking about?
[106:14.03]What happened?
[106:19.33]The stream just like died?
[106:20.53]What's going on?
[106:24.08]Don't tell me I'm gonna blue screen right here.
[106:28.40]If I blue screen right now, I'm gonna be fucking angry.
[106:31.52]It stuttered.
[106:32.28]Oh, God.
[106:34.50]Oh, man.
[106:37.69]Okay, maybe it like almost blue screened.
[106:41.53]Alright.
[106:42.03]Say your fucking prayers, guys.
[106:43.56]Cross your fingers.
[106:44.22]Because why does it keep doing this as a close-up?
[106:48.82]Alright.
[106:49.38]Well, hopefully we got past that.
[106:51.24]I really hope that it doesn't crash again.
[106:53.32]Because it really did happen after an hour last time, right?
[106:58.09]After... So I streamed for an hour and my computer blue-screened.
[107:01.73]I've been streaming for an hour again.
[107:02.87]And it almost blue-screened again.
[107:05.47]So fuck.
[107:06.15]Okay.
[107:06.51]Well... Uh...
[107:10.35]If it happens, I'm sorry.
[107:11.63]I wish there was something I could do about it.
[107:13.31]I don't know what's going on.
[107:14.99]But if for some reason I die, I'll be back.
[107:19.11]If the stream goes down, I'll try to come back as fast as I can.
[107:23.04]So, here we go.
[107:25.40]Let's see our impending doom.
[107:31.98]That was a clown.
[107:34.59]That was a clown, wasn't it?
[107:38.37]It was a clown.
[107:42.99]It actually was a clown.
[107:48.59]No fucking way.
[107:50.65]Oh my god, I can't wait.
[107:54.12]I cannot wait to find the clown.
[107:55.78]Let's turn the generator on.
[108:04.53]I thought this was still part of the cutscene.
[108:08.55]Okay, I can move.
[108:42.54]Oh, you know, you got me.
[108:44.18]You got me.
[108:48.58]Face cam.
[108:49.32]I'm scared to blue screen my computer, guys.
[108:51.64]I can't do the face cam joke again.
[108:53.17]I'm gonna blue screen my computer.
[108:54.91]I can't touch anything.
[108:59.45]I really wanna make the fucking face cam joke again.
[109:04.52]But I feel like if I do that, my computer is going to crash.
[109:13.73]I forgot the face.
[109:21.81]I'll try to get it again.
[109:23.23]Don't worry, there'll be plenty more opportunities to do it.
[109:27.28]At the detriment of blue-screening my computer.
[109:31.86]What am I walking like I have a dump in my pants?
[109:40.74]That was like a pretty sick diaper walk he was just doing.
[109:42.78]I hear music.
[109:49.36]Uh, there's police tape.
[109:51.84]Yeah, I saw that too.
[109:53.56]I think they'd clean it up.
[109:57.64]Well, they never closed the investigation.
[109:59.70]Okay, I'm getting the creeps now.
[110:02.77]Let's prod here.
[110:08.19]It's all such a blur.
[110:09.01]I can barely even remember what happened.
[110:12.99]Well, what I remember is that we played a stupid half-baked prank that probably got Hannah and Beth killed.
[110:19.82]I mean, it's not our fault they ran into the woods.
[110:25.11]It's the guy that was playing's fault for not pressing square at the right time.
[110:28.61]Fuck that guy.
[110:32.59]It wasn't our fault.
[110:34.77]It was Jerma985's.
[110:36.01]He let them both go.
[110:37.31]What a fucking monster.
[110:51.19]Okay.
[110:52.39]Did you hear that?
[110:54.88]Here comes the scary guy.
[110:59.06]Yeah, cool.
[111:03.61]We're gonna get chased, and they always have two people together, because I have to pick which one's gonna... I mean, obviously, I'm getting rid of this guy.
[111:09.51]Jesus!
[111:23.19]I tried.
[111:23.73]I tried.
[111:24.67]Wait, what?
[111:25.19]I tried.
[111:26.41]And stream crash.
[111:27.29]I know.
[111:27.69]I'm coming.
[111:28.23]Yeah, I'm coming down there too.
[111:52.03]I just saw the butterflies that way.
[111:55.84]Oh boy.
[111:56.60]Yeah, I'll help you move it, sure.
[112:01.03]Alright.
[112:07.51]Come on.
[112:08.33]You're supposed to be a strong man.
[112:10.53]And you have another strong woman here to push with you.
[112:12.69]Look at how strong these two are.
[112:14.71]They can move a 5,000 pound mining cart.
[112:18.28]I imagine just grunting together.
[112:19.76]This is not what I pictured.
[112:21.80]I almost just turned the stream off accidentally, by the way.
[112:30.86]Alright, you guys are going to face cam on every emotion.
[112:33.02]No, that's...
[112:42.76]What do I do?
[112:43.42]Fuck.
[112:45.64]I'm gonna fuck it.
[112:46.50]I almost just pressed the stream off button.
[112:49.95]Gross hair, I know, seriously.
[112:52.77]Look, here.
[112:54.19]I'll show you.
[112:56.47]It's typically not this awful.
[112:57.82]Oh shit, fucking heat's gone.
[113:00.08]Oh my gosh, are you okay?
[113:07.55]I didn't comb it.
[113:08.19]I got out of the shower and, like, didn't comb it.
[113:10.27]Oh, God, you totally ate shit.
[113:12.25]You know what I mean?
[113:13.23]It doesn't really look like this fucking awful.
[113:15.13]And you see how sweaty it is in here?
[113:16.49]It's fucking bad in here.
[113:19.73]Yes.
[113:21.33]Yes.
[113:28.07]Pay attention.
[113:28.65]Oh, Nellie.
[113:29.37]This place is giving me the willies.
[113:32.47]And not the good kind of willies.
[113:34.85]Your hair is like the string beans they grow.
[113:36.79]I know, it's like a pineapple.
[113:38.65]We'll save it for the cabin buster.
[113:42.49]I got out of the shower and I didn't have my comb, so I literally have a pineapple haircut right now.
[113:50.94]I missed a clue.
[113:55.26]You alright?
[113:56.32]Yeah.
[113:57.54]Close one.
[113:59.34]I don't think this place is up to code.
[114:02.24]Yeah, I'm thinking it's time to go.
[114:04.24]Why are we going down here anyways?
[114:14.97]And what's with this gold on table thing I keep seeing?
[114:21.29]Areas.
[114:21.73]Okay, hold on.
[114:22.81]Danger, danger, danger, danger.
[114:26.49]Everything is dangerous.
[114:30.05]Okay.
[114:31.72]So I can't go anywhere.
[114:34.52]Extreme rock fall.
[114:36.00]Food risk.
[114:38.14]Gotta get food poisoning over there in the food court.
[114:40.04]This is just like the mall.
[114:43.58]Gotta watch out for like the rocks that fall.
[114:45.28]Watch out for the fucking food poisoning.
[115:05.03]Oof.
[115:08.66]Missed the gold on the table.
[115:10.66]Whatever.
[115:20.94]Stop walking into walls?
[115:22.58]Well, it's hard to control the game when you're at 19 frames a second.
[115:29.30]This game ain't even at, like, 30.
[115:33.12]This PS4 exclusive video game can't even utilize the fucking hardware enough to be like 23 frames a second.
[115:45.95]Oh, I'm like reading chat too.
[115:51.71]And I'm like being self-conscious of my pineapple hair.
[115:55.80]Abe Lincoln.
[115:56.48]Where do you see the Lincoln bedroom?
[115:59.66]Oh, are you planning on getting presidential on me?
[116:04.10]Take a ride on Air Force One?
[116:05.38]Was that like a shot at Lincoln?
[116:07.16]Save it for the stump speech, buddy.
[116:09.46]Oh, a telescope.
[116:10.90]It's only one shot at Lincoln that matters.
[116:14.37]Oh, my God.
[116:14.95]That was a bad joke.
[116:16.65]Bad taste.
[116:18.49]Whoa.
[116:19.67]You all right?
[116:21.19]I just saw someone at the cabin.
[116:25.93]That was in poor taste.
[116:30.88]Oh shit, watch out!
[116:32.84]Watch out!
[116:33.18]Where's the spiders?
[116:33.66]Too soon.
[116:33.88]Okay, let's see.
[116:34.32]Northwestern wolf, grizzly bear, or rocky mountain... What was the thing from one of the funniest home videos?
[117:00.37]America's Funniest Home Videos.
[117:01.29]It was the Jackalope.
[117:04.73]And it was a guy from Modern Family.
[117:07.36]No, not Modern Family.
[117:09.28]Bob Saget was in the show.
[117:12.06]Full House.
[117:13.42]The guy from Full House who voiced it.
[117:14.60]It was the Jackalope.
[117:20.59]That's exactly what that looks like.
[117:21.87]Look it up.
[117:27.27]You guys are all too young to remember.
[117:28.49]Yeah.
[117:34.31]Come over here.
[117:35.75]Get out of the way.
[117:40.62]You guys don't even know?
[117:41.32]Like, type in the Jackalope.
[117:44.98]From America's Funniest Home Videos.
[117:46.36]Alright, we're gonna see, like, more people cheating on other people, right?
[117:51.63]What the fuck was that?
[117:52.33]Come on, let's do it again.
[118:02.23]Is that gonna happen again?
[118:03.25]I, like, hope it does.
[118:08.45]No Spider-clown He looked really happy about that Whatever, let's go Alright We've had enough fun with the storyline It's time for someone to die
[118:39.07]You know what I mean?
[118:41.03]It's like, nobody watches a horror movie for the shitty storyline about, like, exes sleeping with exes.
[118:46.41]I wanna see somebody get their face smashed in with an axe.
[118:54.15]It's like, you don't buy Playboy for the articles.
[118:55.89]I mean, that's an old joke, but, like... You don't buy a horror movie to watch, like, the drama between the ex-boyfriends.
[119:06.79]What is going on back here?
[119:08.13]Why is the camera staying there?
[119:09.15]There it is.
[119:09.45]That's a jackalope.
[119:12.12]It's going to put on a... It's a bird.
[119:13.10]Watch out, bird brain.
[119:25.17]Rats with wings.
[119:26.54]Rats.
[119:26.80]Oh, those things are gross!
[119:28.58]Wait, how does a bird... How is a bird gross?
[119:31.18]Birds are like majestic, cute, fun, gross.
[119:34.24]It's a fucking bird.
[120:01.53]I actually have seen Cabin in the Woods.
[120:03.90]I have seen it.
[120:06.10]My playboy to see somebody's face smashed in with an axe.
[120:17.03]No.
[120:18.19]No, that's not like the connection I was making.
[120:21.01]I was just saying like you don't fucking go to watch a horror movie.
[120:26.45]to, like, watch the people... crappily talk to each other about their problems.
[120:31.33]This guy keeps getting hit in the face by snowballs.
[120:34.53]Do you think he'd get annoyed at this point?
[120:37.06]She's gone.
[120:37.84]Okay.
[120:53.67]She threw that snowball so hard that she died.
[120:58.21]I'm trying to figure out the fucking jacuzzi.
[121:06.13]Wait, so we're led to believe that she's been trying to figure out how to turn the water on for the last, like, 40 minutes?
[121:13.96]Yeah, I just, I don't know how to turn on the water.
[121:15.98]I've been sitting here for 45 minutes looking at the different dials.
[121:22.29]Alright Josh, let's see if you know how to hook up the hot water in your big fancy lodge.
[121:33.16]Do I just get in here?
[121:34.46]I think I just get in the water.
[121:35.46]What a waste of water.
[121:39.20]What?
[121:40.22]I thought I was taking a bath.
[121:40.98]What's going on here?
[121:46.46]Get in the bath.
[121:52.27]Alright, well, I'm just gonna waste water.
[121:54.95]Good.
[121:56.89]No hot water?
[121:57.93]Well, deal with it.
[121:58.89]I've taken... Who uses hot water to take a bath?
[122:03.93]You close your fucking eyes, close your nose, and you dunk the fuck in there.
[122:07.83]Hot water... Heat is expensive.
[122:11.69]Shut your fucking eyes.
[122:13.25]And dunk.
[122:15.37]But first, before you do that, we're gonna try to conserve as much water as you can.
[122:18.10]So fill the bathtub.
[122:20.17]Slather like slon- like grab like an Old Spice like you know like the blue slime shit that like Old Spice you know like just dump it in your fucking hand and slime it all over you.
[122:29.46]Get a nice lather going.
[122:31.62]And then just like just fucking jump in, dunk and fucking shake as fast as you can like a fucking- just gyrate.
[122:37.87]And then put on the drain.
[122:44.31]And then get out.
[122:45.11]And no towels, fuck that.
[122:46.93]The environment would allow that.
[122:48.63]No, air dry.
[122:51.51]You turn yourself into a human washing machine.
[122:53.95]Let's go, Josh.
[122:55.63]Let's go.
[122:57.70]Let's see.
[122:58.42]Let's see what they're talking about.
[123:03.82]Okay.
[123:18.34]This door doesn't open.
[123:21.77]Don't you guys remember we talked about this like five streams ago?
[123:26.54]80% of the shit that I say out loud is just fucking around.
[123:31.96]We've already talked about this.
[123:36.89]What am I doing?
[123:38.93]Find Josh to ask about the hot water.
[123:40.61]I don't even know which one is Josh.
[123:41.85]Who is Josh?
[123:43.51]Who is he?
[123:46.34]Can I, like, take a look?
[123:48.18]They've introduced, like, so many characters.
[123:49.42]I don't even know who the fuck that is.
[123:50.90]I think that's the stoner guy, right?
[123:52.51]It's the Mr. Robot guy.
[124:04.63]Those things are a joke, man.
[124:05.91]They don't do shit.
[124:07.13]No way, bro.
[124:08.31]I mean, we used to do it all the time.
[124:09.79]See?
[124:10.21]No way, bro.
[124:11.41]Josh, no hot water's kind of major oversight, don't you think?
[124:15.09]Don't you think?
[124:16.25]Yeah, you just gotta fire up the boiler.
[124:18.70]It's in the basement.
[124:19.76]All right, you guys see if you can find the spirit board.
[124:24.74]Chris, let's go find it.
[124:26.38]It'll be like a scavenger hunt.
[124:28.90]Okay.
[124:29.11]Come in pairs.
[124:31.03]Okay.
[124:32.51]Guess so.
[124:33.13]Brad, you're not going to regret it.
[124:36.05]You up for a ride alone?
[124:37.29]All right.
[124:37.65]Let's come on, though.
[124:42.60]Let's get to the action here until dawn.
[124:44.30]I'm waiting for it.
[124:46.78]You have my interest.
[124:47.88]You have me.
[124:51.46]Let's see it.
[124:54.17]They gotta go get the Luigi board.
[124:55.35]This is where the clowns are.
[125:04.68]Did you notice how I gave Chris and Ash a mission together?
[125:08.57]I was thinking they could use some alone time.
[125:14.98]Ah, they're so sweet together.
[125:16.26]They are very sweet together.
[125:18.26]Told you.
[125:18.62]I wish they'd just freaking get on with it already.
[125:21.66]I swear, they just need, like, something to bond over.
[125:25.47]You know, some sort of traumatic event to send them into each other's arms.
[125:29.35]I mean, at this rate, they'll be in the geriatric ward before Chris makes a move.
[125:34.27]Yep.
[125:35.53]Cool.
[125:41.20]I'm skipping, like, so many clues.
[125:43.00]Yes, Josh?
[125:46.38]I just wanted to say... I love you.
[125:49.84]What?
[125:51.86]It really means a lot to me that everyone came back this year and, you know... By the way, I'm the murderer.
[125:57.29]Axe.
[126:01.03]Sure, let's be nice for once.
[126:02.29]Josh, we're here for you.
[126:04.39]Really, whatever you need, whenever, we're all gonna make it through this.
[126:10.47]Together.
[126:12.11]I want us to have a good time, you know?
[126:17.01]And here comes the axe.
[126:24.72]Please fall right here.
[126:27.60]Oh, come on.
[126:28.02]Give me the... I wish they gave me a quick time event right there so I could just not do it and fall.
[126:43.02]Here it is.
[126:46.83]Sorry to drag you down into the bowels.
[126:48.79]Just get me some hot water and I'll be super fine.
[126:51.39]Is that Hayden Patieri?
[126:53.21]I mean, I wouldn't want you coming down here on your own.
[126:56.11]You know?
[126:57.89]Well, it's definitely creepy down here.
[127:01.46]Yep.
[127:03.36]Not a place to be on your own.
[127:06.52]My name is Josh.
[127:07.40]I smell like an axe.
[127:10.28]Hey, Josh, I just... I mean, you smell kind of odd.
[127:13.74]You smell like the handle of an axe.
[127:16.80]Have you been holding, gripping an axe really tightly recently?
[127:19.94]Ah, no, no babe.
[127:20.78]Axe body spray.
[127:22.18]Don't move.
[127:22.74]What?
[127:24.63]I didn't move.
[127:25.53]I'm holding the fucking controller in my lap.
[127:49.03]Oh my fucking god, seriously.
[127:52.83]I'm putting the controller down.
[127:53.87]I'm not touching it.
[127:56.35]I'm literally, the controller is on the desk.
[128:06.62]Okay, I did it that time.
[128:12.78]I did.
[128:13.12]I just wanted to see how funny that was going to be.
[128:24.32]Come on!
[128:24.94]I can't sit here like this.
[128:26.18]Nice one.
[128:27.58]Nice one.
[128:30.62]Good job, Jeremy.
[128:31.42]You stood still.
[128:32.20]Comedy goals.
[128:32.78]Okay.
[128:55.02]I saw a guy to the right.
[128:55.98]Did you see that?
[128:57.72]Somebody just ran by.
[128:58.54]He's dead.
[129:00.81]Wait, there was a guy on the... Fuck.
[129:04.73]Now I'm angry that I just did that.
[129:06.31]I thought there was a guy with an axe coming around.
[129:08.99]You can miss the high five.
[129:10.45]What the hell is that?
[129:14.76]That could be a lot of things.
[129:17.48]Prank him.
[129:20.02]Oh shit, there's something behind you.
[129:24.36]He's gonna get pranked.
[129:29.26]No, there really is something behind you.
[129:47.71]This is fucking terrifying.
[129:48.91]I'm acting way too hard here.
[129:51.21]Alright, alright.
[129:56.38]Standing here for way too long.
[129:58.02]Wait, something actually is here behind me.
[130:00.66]Oh, wait a minute.
[130:18.19]Yeah, we go together.
[130:20.07]This guy's the fucking murderer.
[130:21.21]They don't split up, ever.
[130:40.27]What if it's like a pipe that's about to burst or some problem with the furnace?
[130:44.93]Was that a person just sitting right there on the left?
[130:46.69]It was a clown.
[130:49.51]Yeah, right.
[130:52.07]I think there's a rat.
[130:55.31]There's a silhouette of a rat.
[130:58.09]I told them I wasn't scared of this shit.
[131:03.08]No, it's just this guy.
[131:07.30]Nice.
[131:11.80]Wait, he took the mask off.
[131:13.10]Why would you take the mask off?
[131:16.22]Oh, I gotta hide my identity.
[131:17.33]No, I'm gonna take it off now.
[131:18.21]I don't care if they see me at this point.
[131:19.55]It's a rat cake.
[131:22.45]Oh, it's just a prank.
[131:38.08]What?
[131:39.90]Nice one.
[131:40.74]That was good.
[131:41.68]Come on.
[131:42.26]Why would you do that?
[131:43.94]Are they going to pull a Scream 1 on us?
[131:45.40]This cool old movie crap down here.
[131:47.64]Was I not supposed to take advantage of the opportunity?
[131:50.62]All right, so Scream 1 spoilers.
[131:52.56]Okay, for those of you that haven't seen Scream 1.
[131:54.10]Were you in on this, putz?
[131:57.53]Scream 1.
[131:58.01]Mute right now.
[131:58.69]Come back in 30 seconds.
[131:59.89]If you've never seen Scream 1, mute right now.
[132:01.63]30 seconds.
[132:01.95]Come back.
[132:03.27]They're gonna pull a scream one on us.
[132:05.23]Where like these two dead guys are like, these guys are like just fucking around.
[132:08.27]And they're both in on it.
[132:10.93]They're both the killer.
[132:12.37]And it turns out it was like Billy and his friend, you know, like Stuart, whatever his name was, right?
[132:16.19]And like the whole time, it's gonna, don't do a fucking scream one to me.
[132:20.95]Alright, they come back.
[132:23.25]What in God's name are you wearing?
[132:25.13]I found my true calling.
[132:29.87]Please tell me you're gonna take a vow of silence.
[132:34.24]I just told you to mute.
[132:35.64]I told you to mute the stream for 30 seconds if you haven't seen Scream 1.
[132:38.76]I gave you like 10 to 12 seconds of bare warning.
[132:39.80]Come back, he says.
[132:40.20]Well, how would you know that?
[132:40.80]I heard it.
[132:41.02]I heard it.
[132:41.40]What?
[133:02.57]Oh, yes.
[133:03.01]This is my favorite part of the whole game.
[133:10.73]I swear to God, this is my favorite portion of the game.
[133:19.91]I would like to understand your feelings toward people of fear, isolation, loneliness.
[133:26.89]Why is my hand... Do you share...
[133:32.35]Whose hat is that?
[133:34.47]There's a spider on the desk.
[133:36.45]Hold on, wait a minute.
[133:38.41]There's a spider and there's a syringe on the desk.
[133:42.75]Is that what this is?
[133:43.85]You're just gonna haphazardly just throw these random items here to scare me?
[133:51.91]That's why I did the last test?
[133:54.65]No, I don't, like, fear isolation.
[134:00.65]How do you feel about people who are afraid?
[134:08.11]People that are afraid.
[134:09.21]I feel sympathy.
[134:10.39]How do you feel about a syringe?
[134:11.75]Mike has a fear of isolation.
[134:13.86]Do you feel pity for him?
[134:19.70]No, I don't.
[134:20.40]Fuck Mike.
[134:22.48]Indeed, that is apparent from the choices you've made.
[134:28.07]What if he had a clown nose on?
[134:29.61]I would lose it.
[134:34.63]He has a clown nose on.
[134:42.79]I wish.
[134:43.33]Yeah, and every so often he just reaches up.
[134:47.79]He reaches up and just goes like... I have to like every couple sentences.
[135:02.28]Which would you say was most important in a person, loyalty or honesty?
[135:07.95]Most important thing in a person, I would say I value honesty in somebody.
[135:15.67]So you would tell the truth even if it resulted in an unpleasant outcome for a friend.
[135:21.78]And what about honesty then and charity?
[135:27.40]Value honesty versus charity.
[135:32.40]I mean, I think honesty is extremely important.
[135:35.97]You have to be honest.
[135:38.27]So be honest with me, Doctor.
[135:39.41]Why the fuck is there a syringe and a spider on the desk?
[135:46.29]Charity's overrated, I suppose.
[135:48.67]Better to be true to yourself than to help others in need, eh?
[135:51.68]No, that's not what I mean.
[135:53.76]I just mean, like, honestly... I'm afraid we're out of time.
[135:56.58]You have to be honest.
[135:57.66]We'll talk again soon.
[136:04.88]You only pull the covers over your eyes so often.
[136:07.67]What was that famous, um...
[136:09.86]What was the famous Mark Twain quote, right?
[136:12.56]Was there the Mark Twain or some writer?
[136:14.84]He said... It was just a prank, Han.
[136:17.36]If you... Yeah, yeah.
[136:21.66]Always tell the truth.
[136:22.70]You don't have to lie to anybody.
[136:24.05]What is it?
[136:24.79]You don't have to worry about telling the truth as long as you don't... What the fuck?
[136:29.15]What is it?
[136:29.55]What is that fucking quote from Mark Twain?
[136:31.63]What is it?
[136:32.23]We're all still here together.
[136:34.07]And I'm thinking of them.
[136:35.31]You don't have to be like, you don't have to have a good memory if you never tell a fucking, if you never tell a lie.
[136:39.16]What is it?
[136:39.44]Somebody look it up.
[136:42.04]You'll find it.
[136:43.92]You'll find it.
[136:45.28]You never have to remember what you said if you never lied.
[136:49.14]There you go.
[136:49.78]Mark Twain.
[136:50.10]If you always tell the truth, you never have to remember anything.
[136:54.14]There it is.
[137:06.28]That's how it's gonna be.
[137:11.54]Jess?
[137:13.83]Jess?
[137:15.05]So, it says here, to communicate with the spirit world, you must free your mind of all preconceptions, drop all inhibitions, and
[137:22.06]Generally give yourself over entirely to the will of others, sublimating your every desire to the whims of the spirit master, which is me.
[137:28.85]It doesn't say that.
[137:29.49]But then you could be a clever... We're all clever.
[137:31.23]Oh, here we go.
[137:31.79]Here comes the Ouija board.
[137:32.67]This is important.
[137:33.65]Chris, come on.
[137:34.53]This is serious.
[137:36.87]I'm deadly serious.
[137:39.50]Oh, shush.
[137:40.12]That was a solid seven or eight out of ten funny, goofy English guy with a big hat and a mustache.
[137:44.70]That was pretty solid.
[137:46.64]Ashley, since you're a recent convert, why don't you be our medium for today?
[137:51.14]He who goes to bed early wakes up early.
[137:54.58]We're going to be like a joke.
[137:57.07]I would treat this as a joke.
[137:57.97]So we're going to do like abracadabra here.
[137:59.49]Okay.
[138:00.35]Preston with Jessica.
[138:01.75]Is anyone there?
[138:02.41]Hello?
[138:04.71]Pick up the phone.
[138:06.13]Spirit, spirit phone.
[138:09.57]Abracadabra.
[138:10.57]Come on.
[138:12.23]If you can hear my voice, give us a sign.
[138:14.72]Yeah, like a peace sign or stop sign.
[138:17.36]Guys, you're not going to take this seriously.
[138:19.40]Okay, okay.
[138:21.03]Is anyone there?
[138:22.37]Memory is a superpower.
[138:23.95]Mark Twain.
[138:26.23]It's true.
[138:26.91]You guys don't think so.
[138:27.93]I'm going to influence this and write something mean.
[138:29.69]Wait a minute.
[138:30.59]Did you do that?
[138:31.18]I didn't do anything.
[138:32.12]It's moving again.
[138:36.28]H?
[138:36.62]Hold on.
[138:37.00]How's this happening?
[138:38.00]Are you moving it?
[138:38.88]I swear, it's just moving.
[138:42.24]Help?
[138:43.69]What?
[138:44.23]How are we supposed to help?
[138:45.41]I don't know.
[138:46.03]What does it mean?
[138:47.45]We need to know who it is if we're supposed to help them.
[138:53.29]Probe it.
[138:55.28]How can we help you?
[138:56.42]It's moving again.
[138:59.04]I fucking love cocaine.
[139:00.70]What's it spelling?
[139:03.08]Alph.
[139:03.76]It's Alph.
[139:05.80]I laughed way too early at that.
[139:06.97]That would have been funny.
[139:07.85]Fuck.
[139:08.53]I think we really need to find out who's trying to communicate with us.
[139:13.29]HP me.
[139:15.23]Probe it.
[139:17.31]We can't help you if we don't know who you are.
[139:20.98]Can you tell us who you are?
[139:24.38]Alph.
[139:26.12]Here it goes.
[139:27.00]That's, like, not that funny, but, like, I. I. S. T. E. Sister.
[139:34.31]Sister?
[139:35.53]Who's sister?
[139:36.33]Oh, come on.
[139:36.99]Is this for real?
[139:37.77]Shut up.
[139:38.71]Ask it who's sister.
[139:39.73]Josh, it's got to be.
[139:41.73]Yeah.
[139:42.33]Alph.
[139:42.55]Okay, well, which sister is it, then?
[139:45.81]Ashley, ask who it is.
[139:51.17]Beth, is that you?
[139:52.72]Who?
[139:54.24]are we speaking to?
[139:57.18]Beth?
[139:59.08]Is that you?
[140:00.94]You can hear, like, the fucking, the, the violin.
[140:04.34]Oh, God.
[140:06.04]This weird violin comes up, you know, that something bad happens.
[140:08.38]Josh, are you?
[140:10.14]Fine.
[140:10.96]Are you sure?
[140:11.40]Because we can stop.
[140:12.44]No.
[140:13.60]Dude, it's cool.
[140:14.84]I want to hear what it says.
[140:15.98]I don't know where to start.
[140:18.54]Think about it.
[140:19.64]If this is actually Beth, I mean...
[140:22.92]We can find out what happened that night.
[140:24.22]This is bullshit.
[140:24.88]They didn't even read from the book.
[140:26.04]You have to say the magic words first.
[140:32.48]We're so sorry.
[140:33.78]Beth.
[140:35.92]Oh, Beth, we want to apologize for what happened last year with Hannah.
[140:40.02]And if you can hear this, please, please know that we are all so sorry.
[140:46.02]You and Hannah.
[140:47.52]We're really sorry, Beth, to both of you.
[140:50.95]Age?
[140:51.67]Oh.
[140:53.41]A. N. Hannah, kill.
[140:56.00]Hannah, killed.
[140:56.46]That guy on the left is clearly the killer.
[140:59.76]It's one of these three people is the killer.
[141:20.62]You can't put this on a Ouija board, you know?
[141:23.00]Because Ouija boards, people, you just put... Somebody's moving it.
[141:25.92]One of these three people is the one that's moving it.
[141:28.30]And they're the one that killed everybody.
[141:29.50]Oh, no.
[141:32.37]There's your proof.
[141:33.33]One of these three fucking idiots is moving the device.
[141:37.11]Did you ever think about that one?
[141:49.55]Shit, this isn't real.
[141:51.39]Josh, I don't know what's going on.
[141:54.21]Listen, I don't know.
[141:57.40]Alf killed her.
[141:58.46]Messing with me is somehow going to help me deal with my grief or whatever, but this is not cool.
[142:03.48]Josh, no.
[142:04.38]You wanted to use the spirit board.
[142:06.42]Hey, calm down.
[142:07.06]It's not Ash's fault.
[142:07.76]I don't need this right now, okay?
[142:09.22]You guys are full of it.
[142:13.50]Should we go after him?
[142:16.36]What if it was all three of them and they're just trying to fuck with each other?
[142:20.90]All three of them killed like two people.
[142:22.76]Spirit board.
[142:23.34]They're all testing each other.
[142:45.39]See?
[142:45.77]Oof!
[142:47.07]Oof.
[142:48.63]You don't write oof.
[142:54.91]I feel like I would be running right now if I'm this guy.
[143:10.75]Like, I'm just gonna walk.
[143:13.44]That's what we do.
[143:14.30]We walk when somebody's in trouble.
[143:17.12]Very slowly.
[143:17.66]We examine broken tractors.
[143:21.52]Whoa!
[143:27.83]Christ!
[143:30.09]That was way too late.
[143:31.29]I scared the blue out of my jeans.
[143:33.61]What the hell is that doing in there anyway?
[143:40.11]Oh no, the clown!
[143:46.50]Jess, where did you go?
[143:48.80]This is not funny.
[143:52.82]Let me take a look at something here.
[143:57.36]Whose side are you on?
[143:58.78]Be her hero.
[143:59.64]Something for later.
[144:01.40]Josh locked the baseball bat in the cupboard.
[144:03.56]Okay.
[144:07.97]Mike came to Jessica's aid immediately.
[144:09.61]Jessica appreciated Mike's heroism.
[144:14.02]Matt sided with Emily during the fight with Jessica.
[144:18.12]And Matt confronted Mike.
[144:20.30]Matt saw Mike and Emily flirting, and I confronted.
[144:22.36]Okay.
[144:25.23]Let's go.
[144:27.95]I like how Jerm is trying to be that cool streamer.
[144:33.58]What am I doing?
[144:35.78]Cool.
[144:36.46]We're trying to be cool.
[144:40.49]God damn it.
[144:41.43]It's fucking Jackalope.
[144:42.61]No.
[144:42.67]No.
[144:43.07]Recorded without my consent there.
[144:46.65]You delete that video.
[145:01.63]Yeah, there's so many pranks.
[145:02.57]There's a lot of pranks here.
[145:29.17]It's been a long time to think of that one.
[145:32.27]I'm gonna kill ya.
[145:32.83]This guy's like a thermal camera or something.
[145:35.91]I don't care.
[145:37.35]Whatever.
[145:38.35]Pretty good clown vision.
[145:58.62]Clown vision.
[145:59.65]Okay, that's a guidance totem.
[146:10.45]Vision of guidance for future choice.
[146:13.07]Looks like I'm looking at a water wheel.
[146:16.58]Let's take a look at the new information.
[146:20.88]Sometime after the prospectors came to mine this mountain.
[146:26.30]Okay.
[146:31.64]Okay, we don't know anything.
[146:32.98]You missed a guidance totem, now you lose.
[146:38.60]Oh, well.
[146:45.12]Gold miners.
[146:48.20]It was the prospectors that did it.
[146:51.58]They were looking for gold.
[146:54.58]They were driven mad in the California gold rush.
[146:59.86]You know what it's like to take a shit?
[147:01.48]I'm sure you do.
[147:05.74]I'm sure we all do.
[147:07.48]I was going to follow that up with a shit in a covered wagon, but I just didn't keep going.
[147:13.09]I thought something was going to happen, so I stopped.
[147:17.93]Wait, come back.
[147:18.35]I don't want to miss any clues.
[147:32.29]Jessica, peer over the edge real hard.
[147:34.39]I promise I won't bush you.
[147:37.79]Knew it.
[147:38.69]I got a clue.
[147:40.33]Well, well, well.
[147:41.77]Look at this fun little lovebird carving.
[147:44.11]M plus E. Matt and Emily.
[147:52.36]An M and an E.
[147:55.18]Any idea what that could stand for?
[147:58.40]Could be any... Elizabeth and Myron.
[148:02.62]Or maybe Michael and Emily?
[148:04.96]Yeah, that's what it is.
[148:07.06]I just didn't realize you were so sappy.
[148:10.16]Pun intended.
[148:11.40]Just confess.
[148:12.84]Honesty.
[148:14.42]I may look like a tough and rugged manly man on the exterior, but deep down, I'm in touch with my feelings.
[148:21.86]I'm not afraid to show a little affection now and again.
[148:26.21]Can't wait for the next prank jump scare.
[148:27.85]Oh God.
[148:28.09]Oh God.
[148:28.35]Oh God.
[148:28.55]Come on now.
[148:55.20]What is this FPS?
[148:56.16]You were watching maybe 9 FPS.
[149:01.78]Those hardcore exclusive PlayStation 4 titles.
[149:07.48]Another jackalope.
[149:08.68]That's where she scared me that one time.
[149:16.31]Alright, who's next?
[149:17.85]Where am I going?
[149:19.49]Should we be going this way?
[149:20.53]Where am I going?
[149:22.83]Why am I taking her back here?
[149:33.44]What happened to not reading chat?
[149:34.94]Well, I started reading chat and I went backwards.
[149:50.81]Do I have PayPal for donations?
[149:53.11]I do not do PayPal donations.
[149:55.79]I do not.
[150:00.27]I have subscriptions and bits turned on.
[150:03.43]I do not do PayPal straight up donations.
[150:08.87]I don't know.
[150:09.71]And I never will.
[150:10.93]So, there you go.
[150:12.01]It's not going to happen.
[150:18.42]Alright, so we already looked at this.
[150:20.94]We're going this way.
[150:21.88]Right?
[150:25.44]Wait.
[150:27.95]Wait a second.
[150:32.11]Did I just go in a fucking circle?
[150:33.85]Where am I supposed to be going?
[150:34.83]Back up here?
[150:36.93]Like to the bridge?
[150:37.77]Didn't we come from the fucking bridge?
[150:45.24]Going in circles.
[150:46.80]I thought I came from this way.
[150:57.47]It's so hot in here.
[150:59.57]I'm getting heat exhaustion.
[151:00.61]That's why I didn't know where to go.
[151:12.49]I would not do well lost in the woods.
[151:14.39]No, I wouldn't do well lost in the woods while holding, like, a pad in front of my face, looking at, like, chat.
[151:19.85]I need to know what you guys are saying.
[151:23.12]I have to know.
[151:23.68]It's definitely not a squirrel.
[151:28.58]That's okay.
[151:33.94]Can I get back inside where the snow doesn't cause, like, nine frames a second?
[151:40.51]Here comes the fucking predator clown.
[151:44.27]Hello?
[151:46.65]Someone there?
[151:47.17]Okay, imagine... You're like... It really was like a jackalope.
[152:02.10]That thing almost killed us.
[152:16.02]Fucking jackalope.
[152:18.62]Can I, like, go over where he was?
[152:23.06]Where did he go?
[152:24.61]Can I, like, go to where he is?
[152:32.15]Shouldn't have thrown it.
[152:33.35]Well, I don't know.
[152:33.97]Wrong way.
[152:42.61]What are you talking about?
[152:44.31]It was the right way.
[152:46.04]Wait, what?
[152:49.66]Yeah.
[152:50.00]Alright, can we get in here?
[152:51.76]Uh-oh, it's a mask.
[152:56.30]Should I put it on and go?
[152:57.88]Oh, it's time to be scary.
[152:59.18]Okay, old mask.
[153:06.75]Yeah, okay.
[153:09.19]This is just the prank video game where we just prank scare until somebody actually dies.
[153:14.72]Hey, look at this.
[153:15.82]It's gonna be scary.
[153:17.22]Oh, my God.
[153:22.50]I got you.
[153:23.86]I got you.
[153:31.57]God, she never even saw the mask.
[153:34.69]He just screamed behind her, holding a device in his hand.
[154:06.53]Alright, what if... There actually is no, like, death.
[154:09.85]There is no murder.
[154:11.55]It's just pranks.
[154:13.99]Just a series of fucking pranks over and over again.
[154:17.70]Until the game ends.
[154:22.64]And then on the way back... They're driving back.
[154:25.82]Everybody's in the car talking about how funny their pranks were.
[154:28.95]Remember when I put that mask on and I scared you?
[154:30.71]Oh my god, that's not even close to when James put on the mask and, like, put the hook behind him and threw it at... Trying to make a joke here.
[154:42.40]They're all talking about their, like, funny pranks that they did, and all of a sudden they fucking drive off a cliff and explode.
[154:49.56]And every single person... I can't make my fucking stupid joke, and you know what it was gonna be?
[155:00.38]It's just a series of pr- what the fuck is this?
[155:05.02]Alright, he- he- okay.
[155:07.13]He gets up and he's like, got ya!
[155:08.65]You thought I had like a cut on my neck.
[155:13.73]Oh, Doyle rules.
[155:17.77]Hey, bud.
[155:19.33]Hey, buddy.
[155:19.97]It's okay.
[155:21.57]It's okay.
[155:23.99]It's okay.
[155:26.35]Mike, it's in so much pain.
[155:29.43]It'll be over soon.
[155:31.49]Okay, buddy.
[155:31.99]It'll be over soon.
[155:35.15]Crank.
[155:36.63]Run!
[155:37.43]Run!
[155:38.03]We got cranked.
[155:39.07]What the hell was that?
[155:40.49]I don't know.
[155:41.43]There's a break.
[155:42.27]Over here.
[155:42.69]Over here.
[155:43.30]Oh, fuck.
[155:48.38]Shit.
[155:49.74]Get over here.
[155:51.64]Oh, fuck.
[155:59.56]Go!
[155:59.86]This way!
[156:08.28]Come on up!
[156:09.08]Come on up, sweetheart!
[156:12.06]It's gotta be a bear.
[156:13.12]No, we're getting pranked by the animals.
[156:20.93]He's just sprinting.
[156:27.42]Oh, no.
[156:30.08]I gotta help her.
[156:31.50]I have to.
[156:33.40]On!
[156:33.62]We gotta go!
[156:34.54]I am!
[156:37.02]Get the knife.
[156:37.52]Get the key!
[156:39.13]Get it open!
[156:41.41]Oh, my God.
[156:43.77]Oh, it's closed.
[156:46.23]I told you guys we got pranked.
[156:47.51]This is just a game of pranks.
[156:48.81]Even the animals are in on it.
[156:49.83]I had it under control.
[156:50.99]The whole time.
[156:52.79]Oh, bullshit.
[156:53.93]100%.
[156:53.95]100%. 110%.
[156:59.73]He's trying to make his YouTube prank video.
[157:01.39]I'm terrible at simple QTEs.
[157:03.05]No, no.
[157:03.33]I did those on purpose.
[157:04.73]I wanted them to fucking fail.
[157:22.62]Because it doesn't really matter.
[157:24.88]The QTEs in this game seem to be... Hey, player.
[157:30.42]Which animation would you like to see?
[157:33.02]Would you like to see animation where a character struggles a little and falls down like a joke?
[157:38.62]Or just jumps and makes it?
[157:40.66]That's it.
[157:41.62]That's all it is.
[157:43.08]So when I'm given an opportunity, it's like, do I want to see a funny guy fall down America's Funniest Home Video thing?
[157:49.77]It don't matter.
[157:50.27]Just what animation do you want to watch?
[157:52.07]That's all it is.
[157:54.13]It doesn't matter.
[157:54.65]Okay.
[158:09.37]Full circle.
[158:10.73]He's back on America's Funniest Home Videos.
[158:16.68]Hey, thank you UglySuperHero for the bits.
[158:19.62]Also thank you UselessAssFuck and Young Miles.
[158:23.66]Thank you guys for the bits.
[158:26.90]Much appreciated.
[158:29.14]You guys rock.
[158:35.52]Alright, we got some updates.
[158:43.05]Be her hero.
[158:44.59]Jessica appreciated my terrorism, but he failed to impress her under pressure.
[158:48.68]What are you talking about?
[158:51.53]Is that because I fell on the vlog and fell down?
[159:00.57]Nice.
[159:01.69]This will lighten up the mood a little.
[159:03.73]Fuse box.
[159:04.57]Open it up.
[159:05.21]Watch out for the snake.
[159:07.13]And Presto Majesto.
[159:09.87]Hey!
[159:10.55]Why?
[159:10.73]Are you okay?
[159:11.63]What are you doing?
[159:13.95]It's the lights.
[159:14.53]Imagine you died here.
[159:15.41]I know.
[159:15.65]It's the lights, dummy.
[159:16.75]You broke them.
[159:18.49]It's probably faulty wiring or something.
[159:20.07]I wish.
[159:20.71]You've got faulty wiring.
[159:23.96]Oh!
[159:37.58]Fuck.
[159:38.09]Mike.
[159:38.75]What?
[159:39.13]What's she missing?
[159:41.67]Where is it?
[159:42.95]What?
[159:43.59]What's wrong?
[159:44.51]Gone.
[159:45.03]It is gone, okay?
[159:46.75]Gone.
[159:47.13]Slow down.
[159:48.05]What is gone?
[159:48.79]My freaking phone, Sherlock.
[159:50.15]Can you find it?
[159:51.27]She dropped that a long time ago.
[159:53.32]I remember.
[159:53.72]I must have dropped it outside.
[159:55.02]Oh.
[159:57.78]I can't lose my phone.
[159:58.98]My parents will kill me.
[160:00.60]You can always get a new one.
[160:01.74]That's like my fourth one.
[160:03.86]Oh, you have responsibility issues there.
[160:05.80]Can we play the pronoun game?
[160:06.64]Okay.
[160:06.78]Parents, I thought these people were all like 40.
[160:11.03]Kind of a dick move.
[160:28.01]These people, they don't look like they're like 19.
[160:33.99]He looks like 36.
[160:35.51]He really does.
[160:36.09]She's like 40.
[160:40.11]Oh, matchbox.
[160:45.23]Perfect.
[160:46.05]With a barcode on it.
[160:46.83]Scan that.
[160:48.19]Somebody scan that and tell me what it is.
[160:52.61]Get that barcode.
[160:53.87]We're getting to the bottom of this.
[160:58.56]Sure thing.
[161:07.08]Light, light her up.
[161:09.54]There's the gun.
[161:11.42]Look at this.
[161:12.32]Perfect.
[161:12.80]Is it a fire?
[161:13.78]No, way cooler.
[161:20.03]Oh, here comes another prank.
[161:23.57]Freeze.
[161:24.71]I am freezing.
[161:27.43]Oh no, another prank!
[161:28.81]Remember guys, every opportunity we're doing a prank.
[161:31.63]Doesn't matter what it is.
[161:32.52]Or what the situation is.
[161:55.98]Never pointing.
[161:57.34]Yeah, that is like gun use and like gun ownership like 101.
[162:02.42]No matter what.
[162:06.28]No matter if the gun has been unloaded a thousand times, you never point a gun at someone.
[162:11.88]No matter what.
[162:13.89]That's a gun ownership like fucking 101.
[162:16.57]This guy's a fucking dinghy.
[162:20.21]This doesn't do anything.
[162:23.49]Native American myths and... Alright.
[162:25.45]Well, another fucking bear.
[162:26.59]Blue find.
[162:33.18]A ward or spell protecting against evil spirits, a vision or dream of the future.
[162:38.78]And the bow and arrow from A Link to the Past.
[162:43.02]Cool.
[162:44.67]Nice.
[162:45.07]Cool.
[162:46.01]Cool.
[162:46.19]Nice.
[162:46.39]Nice.
[162:47.51]Nice.
[162:55.07]Oh, stop.
[162:56.31]I'll get it.
[162:57.21]I just need to check the other surroundings.
[163:06.59]Now, what if I got all those as tattoos?
[163:09.37]Oh, whatever.
[163:09.86]Let's start it.
[163:14.94]Hold it.
[163:18.26]It's so cold in here right now, my tongue will get stuck to your flagpole.
[163:23.24]That took him way too long to do this.
[163:25.87]Honestly, I could do without this whole reach down thing.
[163:29.71]Just open it.
[163:30.25]Do you really need me to do this?
[163:34.97]He couldn't have just done this.
[163:38.05]I have to do it.
[163:38.65]And now I'm going to have to light the match, too.
[163:43.96]You're taking interaction to a level that you're just feigning interaction at that point.
[163:52.16]It's called gameplay.
[163:54.94]Everybody's still alive, though.
[164:14.82]seduce or reassure.
[164:17.78]Let's just make out or what's wrong?
[164:19.58]Okay.
[164:24.89]If somebody was looking at you like that, like, imagine you're the one on the couch looking over here.
[164:31.73]This would freak me out.
[164:35.57]Like, they're going through, like, four stages of grief when you ask them a very simple question.
[164:42.18]No, reassure.
[164:42.98]Why don't you, like,
[164:44.36]He's too fidgety.
[164:45.84]What are you doing, man?
[164:47.86]I'm trying to keep us alive!
[164:50.66]Have you ever watched a horror movie?
[165:08.74]once the once the people start having sexual relations that's when people start to die okay so if we just as god-fearing citizens abstain from the sexual relations nobody will die um close them please that's how it works there's just no one out there I feel like someone's watching us I don't like it yes really it's fine I really
[165:36.50]There's the clown vision.
[165:40.73]I love the clown vision joke.
[165:42.67]It's my favorite.
[165:43.43]Alright, here we go.
[165:44.83]I'm gonna go for the shutters.
[165:49.77]Here comes clown vision.
[165:53.43]And... Interactive gameplay!
[165:58.45]What about closing this one to... Okay, wait!
[166:02.53]Nope.
[166:03.90]No, he's going to come through.
[166:05.46]He's going to Kool-Aid man through the wall.
[166:08.08]Get the gun.
[166:08.72]Now, where were we?
[166:12.64]I'm sorry.
[166:13.28]I'm sorry.
[166:15.97]I think I'm a little freaked out and it's hard for me to keep this up.
[166:22.31]Look, I act all super confident and like a total sexy babe and everything, but underneath, I gotta be honest, I'm really kind of insecure.
[166:33.91]Is this a time and a place for this?
[166:38.38]You're super hot.
[166:40.62]I gotta be reassuring here.
[166:41.66]Like, just tell her.
[166:43.22]No, I'm supposed to abstain from the sexuality stuff.
[166:45.62]Oh, goddammit, I fucking ruined it.
[166:48.67]I ruined it.
[166:49.15]What?
[166:53.38]You have no idea.
[166:54.40]And now people are gonna die.
[166:56.54]You're just like me and everyone else.
[166:58.47]We're all insecure.
[166:59.23]Damn it.
[167:00.25]But you know how to handle yourself.
[167:02.63]I've killed them both.
[167:03.51]You might call it a front, but it's real.
[167:08.64]You've killed them.
[167:11.24]No, no.
[167:11.68]We can't.
[167:12.50]No, let's talk about mathematics.
[167:14.61]Get the sexuality out of here.
[167:18.11]Let's talk about, like, fucking history.
[167:19.65]Get the gun.
[167:43.81]Oh, Michael.
[167:45.25]Blanket?
[167:46.21]Yep, and I'm going for it.
[167:48.89]Go get a blanket.
[167:53.02]I'm gonna hear a scream.
[167:54.34]It's gonna go... Did you find them?
[167:59.22]Yeah, still looking.
[168:00.94]This is when she used to play tennis.
[168:03.43]Hannah winning bronze.
[168:06.73]Nice job, Hannah.
[168:10.66]Yep.
[168:11.24]Here comes the scream.
[168:12.20]I didn't get the gun, by the way.
[168:15.06]And here comes the chest.
[168:19.78]Open it up.
[168:21.50]Hey, there is a blanket in there, isn't there?
[168:23.32]I'm sure.
[168:24.38]What?
[168:32.89]Okay, for a second I thought that was this guy talking.
[168:40.17]I thought it was him saying this.
[168:42.84]He's just like peering through being like a... It was like a different voice.
[168:46.02]That was a different voice.
[168:49.06]I thought it was the guy.
[168:49.90]Get the gun.
[168:52.32]Gun.
[168:58.63]Gun.
[169:00.99]See, you took your clothes off.
[169:03.62]That was the mistake.
[169:04.30]Give me the gun.
[169:05.98]I have to be able to pick it up now, right?
[169:07.22]Oh my god, I would pick this gun up right now.
[169:15.48]I can't pick up the gun.
[169:19.50]Here comes the prank, dear.
[169:22.50]Where was it?
[169:25.38]Shattered glass.
[169:30.73]I think this is her phone.
[169:35.46]It's your phone.
[169:38.68]What?
[169:41.07]How is it my phone?
[169:43.23]I don't know.
[169:43.65]It just came through the window.
[169:46.75]Gun.
[169:47.83]Go get the gun.
[169:50.71]Somebody just threw that in here and shattered the glass.
[169:52.73]Get the gun.
[169:53.20]I can't do this on my own.
[169:54.12]I need some help.
[169:54.84]That's what I just heard.
[170:04.65]Hey!
[170:05.75]Yeah, bricks!
[170:07.41]That means you!
[170:08.87]I know!
[170:11.21]What the fuck are you trying to do?
[170:13.22]Crowd vision.
[170:16.38]Well, guess what?
[170:17.72]You can't.
[170:18.90]You can't ruin our good time because Michael and I are gonna fuck.
[170:23.12]No, shit, don't.
[170:24.38]Stop it.
[170:25.02]Stop saying that.
[170:26.30]And it's gonna be hard.
[170:28.14]So enjoy it because I'm now.
[170:31.27]Stop it!
[170:32.27]Every time she says it, it gets 10% more danger.
[170:37.43]I told you!
[170:49.81]She said it too many times!
[170:51.33]She said, like, fuck sex, fuck fuck, we're gonna have sex, and that got her up to 85% more danger, and then she got grabbed!
[171:02.12]I told you, I'm not making this shit up.
[171:05.74]See guys, this is the method to that madness.
[171:21.28]She just got pulled out of an airplane.
[171:25.04]I feel like that's what would happen if somebody opened up their window on an airplane.
[171:28.78]You ever have like one of those nightmares?
[171:30.12]Where like the airplane door opens and it's like... And everyone just gets like sucked out like fucking... Like going down the drain.
[171:37.51]Holy crap!
[171:42.27]Are you okay?
[171:42.55]I think so.
[171:44.83]Look.
[171:45.33]What?
[171:46.59]There was something behind the books.
[171:49.64]All right, push the button.
[171:50.96]Not even going to hesitate.
[172:03.86]The phone is the killer.
[172:05.30]It's technology.
[172:05.80]Anybody else want to go get, like...
[172:49.74]Okay, whatever.
[172:50.24]It's all about these two girls, huh?
[172:56.70]I will take them and bleed them like pigs and rid their soft white skin off.
[173:00.84]Fucking 16 years.
[173:02.08]16 years I waited for pretty little Hannah.
[173:04.86]And Beth.
[173:10.08]He wrote this.
[173:11.00]That's his handwriting.
[173:13.25]Honesty is the best policy, guys.
[173:15.21]I don't want to freak you out, but...
[173:17.47]Look at this.
[173:18.09]What?
[173:18.79]Chris, what is that?
[173:20.41]I think this might be what the spirit board wanted us to find.
[173:23.96]The clue?
[173:25.12]Yeah, it's a letter.
[173:26.28]Let me see it.
[173:27.58]It's a threat.
[173:29.62]Chris, this is serious.
[173:31.52]We need to find Josh right now.
[173:41.64]It's definitely Josh.
[173:42.70]It has to be.
[173:44.78]A spider just opened the door.
[173:45.89]Let's just get in there.
[173:55.30]For one second, I thought that was a guy.
[173:56.70]Let's see, here's the document proving my innocence, right?
[174:01.78]Dr. C.J.R.
[174:02.60]Swampshon.
[174:03.10]Let's see what's on the back.
[174:19.96]I saw that crazy guy again.
[174:21.38]Thursday, 9.17, hanging around the generator shed.
[174:24.08]Gonna start keeping a record.
[174:28.00]There's two or three killers.
[174:38.25]They try to throw you off by having, like, one guy, like... So I'm right now pretending to be scared as this guy.
[174:45.12]And it can't be this guy, because the killer is on the other side of town with the other group.
[174:50.73]But there's two killers.
[174:51.73]He's one of them.
[174:52.87]Josh is the other one.
[174:54.11]The Ouija board was a fucking bruise.
[174:55.71]So, um... I've just been thinking about something I saw earlier with Sam.
[175:00.75]What?
[175:01.14]I already know the whole thing.
[175:02.72]There was like this wanted poster, like full-on Western style, you know?
[175:06.74]So?
[175:07.72]And Sam really thought there was someone following her around.
[175:11.99]Yep.
[175:12.75]You're fired.
[175:13.19]See, it can't be me.
[175:13.69]Oh!
[175:39.90]See, it was Josh!
[175:41.18]He just, like, grabbed her.
[175:50.15]It's gonna be a prank.
[175:52.57]Just wait.
[175:54.95]Nope!
[175:56.83]It's the clown.
[176:02.55]Wait.
[176:06.99]It's Josh!
[176:07.85]Like, it is, right?
[176:17.78]Like he was just pretending to scream from the other side.
[176:26.76]Am I playing the game now as like the fucking killer?
[176:33.87]I gotta laugh my ass off of this.
[176:38.59]Yes, best part.
[176:54.40]What if it's just this guy?
[176:55.46]That'd be so lame.
[176:56.46]Okay.
[177:15.82]We got sub only mode?
[177:17.22]Do we have an issue?
[177:18.70]Do we have a chat issue?
[177:19.64]Do I like the most?
[177:22.60]Okay.
[177:23.06]I prefer Josh.
[177:24.58]I prefer Sam.
[177:25.50]I mean, like, I don't prefer the killer, so I prefer the other person.
[177:43.72]No, I don't prefer the guy that's the murderer of the game.
[177:47.31]I prefer Matt.
[177:49.05]I do.
[177:50.25]For sure.
[177:54.99]And I prefer... I also don't want to pick the killer again.
[178:00.00]So I prefer Ashley because I'm not pointing at the killer for a second time.
[178:07.80]I prefer Jessica over Mike.
[178:09.08]Mike's kind of a tool.
[178:17.34]I prefer Emily over Josh.
[178:19.74]I prefer Emily, yeah.
[178:24.57]Okay.
[178:27.35]I prefer Mike.
[178:30.03]We're playing Guess Who at this point.
[178:35.73]Yes.
[178:36.85]Tell me, in this little game you're playing so diligently, who is it that you most
[178:44.11]Who do you most dislike?
[178:46.11]Oh, which one of these two do you most dislike?
[178:49.27]Hmm.
[178:56.07]Him.
[178:58.07]Him.
[178:58.71]I don't like his hair.
[178:59.27]Yep.
[178:59.69]Now, why would you think
[179:14.55]Because he's the clown killer.
[179:16.81]He's one of two clown killers.
[179:20.73]Come back soon.
[179:22.38]We'll talk again.
[179:23.76]Perhaps in the meantime you can try to figure that one out for yourself.
[179:28.58]So every time we're done with the session, he walks over to the window.
[179:31.32]I don't understand why.
[179:44.12]Hold on!
[179:44.92]There is one individual we're considering as a person of interest.
[179:47.74]He has an interesting history with the Washington family.
[179:50.58]Apparently, he had warned them against pursuing their construction project... Ah, it's all about the construction.
[179:54.78]...and claimed the land was sacred to his forefathers.
[179:58.20]S. I. S. T. Sister?
[180:02.33]Ask it who's sister.
[180:03.33]Josh, it's gotta be.
[180:05.27]Which sister is it, then?
[180:08.11]Run!
[180:08.55]But why does one of them have clown vision?
[180:10.35]Oh, my God.
[180:12.32]You know?
[180:21.85]Okay, this is when he grabs.
[180:24.69]This is kind of supernatural, though.
[180:33.39]I don't know if Chris... I don't know if Chris could be able to do something like that.
[180:41.06]Alright, here we go.
[180:41.70]This one's really nice.
[180:42.78]Let's grab the gun.
[180:47.93]Mike and the camera.
[180:52.59]Let's go.
[180:54.37]Time to beat Tommy.
[180:55.73]And shoot Jason.
[180:56.33]Here we go.
[181:04.00]Risk the shortcut every time.
[181:05.44]It doesn't even matter.
[181:09.92]Like, none of these matter.
[181:12.44]It's just, like, do you... Like, I'll prove it to you.
[181:15.42]Watch this.
[181:16.04]It's just what animation you want.
[181:18.88]See?
[181:18.98]Like, oh, he fell down on his back.
[181:22.06]Oh, no.
[181:22.43]It's okay.
[181:24.31]It was just a separate animation than, like, getting overcorrected.
[181:26.77]There's no health bars.
[181:32.53]Just watch this guy fall down.
[181:36.64]Jessica!
[181:40.57]Just keep running.
[181:48.97]And jump over this.
[181:54.00]What am I aiming at?
[182:05.02]Okay.
[182:10.96]What?
[182:11.46]Shoot the guy that's dragging her!
[182:13.56]Alright, I'll get this one.
[182:22.89]Got it.
[182:24.13]Did I lose the gun?
[182:26.45]Oh fuck, I lost the gun.
[182:28.19]No, I didn't.
[182:37.12]No, almost messed that one up.
[182:41.19]slide jump I feel like a horse at an equestrian competition that's that's at least it's at least a fucking 75 joke what if I missed that okay I'm actually gonna I gotta be careful
[183:08.53]Risk slide down.
[183:09.55]Risk the slide down.
[183:10.43]We're doing the risk every time.
[183:12.38]Look, we're making time, though.
[183:16.96]We're making progress.
[183:22.32]See?
[183:23.00]And now I made up the time that I lost in the very beginning.
[183:32.40]Then we're gonna aim the gun down sights and shoot.
[183:36.66]That person.
[183:37.08]There we go.
[183:38.86]Get the lantern.
[183:39.92]Thank you for the gameplay.
[183:41.18]Appreciate that you have lantern gameplay.
[183:45.52]I mean, do you really need the light right now?
[183:52.35]Alright, get in.
[184:06.11]Uh, the elevator.
[184:10.59]Over here.
[184:14.45]You are taking your time going down these stairs.
[184:16.93]This dude just jumped off four cliffs.
[184:19.36]Alright, gotta take my time down the stairs.
[184:21.12]I don't want to step my toe on the wood.
[184:22.92]That would be unsafe.
[184:28.80]And now, you know, I'm gonna walk now.
[184:37.59]That's fine.
[184:41.15]I was in such a hurry before.
[184:46.37]Wait, what?
[184:50.16]What happened?
[184:52.96]What even happened?
[184:54.98]What happened?
[184:55.82]She's fine.
[184:56.46]She's fine.
[184:57.36]She just got like... She's alright.
[185:03.36]Help with what?
[185:03.94]I don't understand.
[185:09.50]Okay, I wonder maybe you shouldn't have fucking walked.
[185:18.72]Got him.
[185:19.16]Got him.
[185:36.96]Don't ever peek your head out, dude.
[185:38.32]What are you, stupid?
[185:39.19]Have you never played Battlefield?
[185:48.67]We have to go fast.
[185:54.08]Okay, I almost blew that one.
[185:56.12]Not gonna lie.
[185:56.60]I love how they're nice and big for me to see with my old person eyes.
[186:09.71]So what's the point of going slow?
[186:12.64]I don't think I'm ever gonna do it.
[186:13.86]Maybe that's why.
[186:20.58]I... I got it the last second.
[186:21.94]I was looking at the... Don't lose the gun.
[186:29.51]Thank god.
[186:34.83]What are you... What the f... Shoot him!
[186:40.06]Shoot him with the gun.
[186:42.04]Shoot the gun at this guy.
[186:43.14]Why did you put it on your back?
[186:44.58]Shoot him!
[186:47.98]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[186:53.21]Keep it as a fucking weapon, a melee weapon.
[186:55.47]Are you serious?
[186:56.87]I just gotta make it!
[187:06.56]If I didn't shoot the gun before, I would have been able to shoot him.
[187:21.34]What about the girl?
[187:22.82]I think that girl is gone.
[187:25.50]I'm pretty sure that girl is gone.
[187:26.74]If she's not, then... By the way, I'm still in a tank top.
[187:35.70]in this blistering cold.
[187:46.97]He dies out here.
[187:48.51]You can't survive out here like this.
[187:52.27]Even, like, fucking Batman would have a problem out here.
[187:55.39]In his suit.
[187:56.23]I'm not talking about Bruce Wayne.
[187:57.40]I'm talking about Batman like Bruce Wayne.
[188:00.30]And Batman.
[188:11.93]Where did Matt and Emily go?
[188:13.19]I don't know.
[188:14.43]Okay.
[188:25.44]0041.
[188:27.58]I have to pee.
[188:28.76]Can we take a pee break?
[188:29.48]Yeah, I'm going to take a little pee break here, guys.
[188:32.12]I really have to pee.
[188:34.10]I'll be right back.
[188:36.76]BRB.
[188:37.45]Pee.
[191:00.77]Honest to God.
[191:02.37]It, uh... It might be... Like, fucking... A hundred degrees in my room.
[191:10.50]Down here.
[191:12.54]Those of you that are wondering why I don't have... Um... Like, why don't you have AC down there?
[191:18.01]Or a fan?
[191:19.93]I'm down in, like, the basement.
[191:22.01]So there's no, um...
[191:26.37]There's no AC down here.
[191:29.17]And sometimes it just gets sweltering down here.
[191:37.29]I'm going to have to get one of those portable AC units, right?
[191:43.15]And when I mean portable, I mean like a plug-and-play.
[191:46.17]Like it's a USB-powered air conditioning unit, right?
[191:49.03]They make those, don't they?
[191:51.77]Plug it into USB and set it and just forget it.
[191:53.69]Let's go.
[191:55.70]Ash.
[191:57.02]ASH!
[191:59.02]Looking for ash.
[192:03.07]I have windows.
[192:04.07]Both of my windows are open here.
[192:05.77]But it is like as hot outside as it is in this room.
[192:10.11]So I either get fresh air in extreme heat or like dry extreme heat.
[192:15.81]And I'm not sure which one is worse.
[192:17.21]At least I get a little breeze.
[192:20.59]What the fuck?
[192:22.19]I'm not scared of crows.
[192:22.91]I already told you that.
[192:27.71]Oh, shit.
[192:28.63]Blood.
[192:29.97]No.
[192:32.15]Here comes the clown.
[192:32.73]You hear the clown music?
[192:33.77]I hear circus music.
[192:38.27]Ash!
[192:42.91]Coco!
[192:45.22]It's getting quiet.
[192:58.65]Looks like we're going this way.
[193:04.87]Needles.
[193:12.08]I mean, I get the whole atmospheric thing, the no sense of urgency run thing.
[193:17.83]but I really wish I could jog or something.
[193:21.31]Let's go over here.
[193:22.53]Okay, well there's like a dead body.
[193:28.26]Crows are eating something.
[193:32.43]Okay.
[193:32.89]Scarecrow.
[193:34.31]Scarecrow.
[193:45.66]Yep, that's a little scary, sure.
[193:49.52]I did say I was scared of scarecrows, so... What's a pig's head?
[193:54.48]What the fuck?
[193:58.42]Why is this a clue?
[194:02.54]Pig's head dumped on the mountain.
[194:03.64]It's fresh and there's blood all over it.
[194:05.88]Okay.
[194:07.56]The mystery man.
[194:13.47]Something else, too.
[194:15.84]Ah, it's one of those totems.
[194:17.06]Let's see.
[194:18.76]Let's see our destiny.
[194:24.71]Doesn't really help me.
[194:32.61]I think that... Is that me?
[194:34.29]Is that Chris?
[194:36.41]I think it might be Chris.
[194:39.03]Oh well.
[194:41.47]Well, I got plenty of clues.
[194:42.67]Time to go back and go the other way.
[194:44.71]Get jumpscared again by another fucking scarecrow.
[194:49.47]Scared of clowns, you're scared of scarecrows, you're scared of bugs, you're scared of snakes.
[194:54.72]And needles.
[194:58.30]The most terrifying of them all.
[195:04.44]Ash!
[195:09.42]So wait, if I just saw my own death, can I go underneath her?
[195:19.00]So that's my death.
[195:21.56]So maybe this guy isn't the killer.
[195:22.70]Maybe I was wrong.
[195:25.58]I could have been wrong.
[195:27.70]Josh is definitely one of them.
[195:32.64]But that might just be a red herring.
[195:35.15]Where he's just like the weird guy that always seems to be in the situation that he's in.
[195:39.09]And he always seems like he's the killer.
[195:41.85]And it's somebody else completely different.
[195:43.09]I mean, the horror movies are full of red herrings.
[195:49.74]They're also full of straw mans too.
[195:51.94]As we just saw previously.
[195:53.04]A couple of straw men that... It was a scarecrow joke.
[195:58.62]If you need to know.
[196:03.04]I'm here.
[196:03.86]Where are you?
[196:06.71]Are you okay?
[196:08.05]What the hell happened?
[196:11.91]Oh God Here comes a bit now.

[197:37.82]I am really, really deep in thought right now.
[197:40.37]Ooh.
[197:43.21]I mean, I think, I thought that, I think Josh is like, it's one of these, it's one of these three.
[197:48.95]It's just, I am the killer.
[197:50.37]Like, Chris is the killer, so I'm gonna kill somebody right now.
[197:56.29]You know?
[198:01.01]like it's one of these three people is one of the bad people oh josh is way too suspicious for me I really I'm gonna have to say
[198:29.12]I'm sorry, Josh is too suspicious.
[198:31.12]I'm sorry, dude.
[198:40.63]This is insane!
[198:42.05]This is nuts!

[198:56.50]I'm so scared!
[198:57.88]So I picked... I'm killing Josh.
[198:59.66]I'm kind of messed up and everything, but I'm getting better, man, I swear!

[199:17.33]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[199:19.17]Oh, God!
[199:19.77]Close your eyes!
[199:20.71]Grant!
[199:21.75]Why would you do this?
[199:23.21]Oh, God, what did I do?
[199:26.35]Oh, God.
[199:26.99]Stop it!
[199:27.80]You can't do this!
[199:30.00]Oh, God, this is bad.
[199:36.50]Oh, my God.
[199:38.26]Oh, my God.
[199:40.01]No, no, no, don't look, Ash.
[199:41.53]Why can't I look, Chris?
[199:43.01]Please tell me he's okay, please.
[199:46.37]This has turned to like an 18 plus three.
[199:49.34]I'm coming, Ash.
[199:49.90]I'm gonna get you, I'm letting you down.
[199:52.82]Stop, please.
[199:54.50]Come on, come on, let's get you down.
[199:56.20]Come on, we're gonna get you out of here.

[199:59.62]I was about to say holy shit.
[200:01.76]No!
[200:02.76]You gotta go, okay?
[200:04.22]Tell me he's okay.
[200:10.68]Uh, nope.
[200:11.39]Sorry, Ashley.
[200:12.33]He's not okay.
[200:16.52]Oh, there's Matt and Emily.
[200:24.28]Why is he explaining this like a four-year-old?
[200:46.95]There was a bike, and I fell down, and the bully was mean.
[200:51.80]I killed him.
[200:52.36]I killed him.
[200:56.58]It was my fault.
[200:58.48]No, no, this is insane.
[200:59.84]We need to go get some help.
[201:01.24]I got right in half.
[201:03.25]Well, compose yourself.
[201:04.15]We've got to figure it out.
[201:04.79]You've got to go for it.
[201:05.79]We need to go get help now.
[201:06.91]I don't know.
[201:07.77]I don't know.
[201:14.02]Jeremiah's emotions.
[201:18.42]No, I'm just saying, like, the maniac could be right fucking behind you still.
[201:24.20]Collect everybody.
[201:26.10]Collect your thoughts.
[201:26.82]I would be a leader in this situation.
[201:28.97]I would be a leader here.
[201:31.25]I would be like, one, two, three, with me, let's go.
[201:34.77]Pick up a rock.
[201:35.87]Everyone have a rock in your hand.
[201:36.91]If you don't have a rock in your hand, you're not following me.
[201:39.71]I'm, follow me.
[201:43.36]Everybody get a fucking rock.
[201:45.90]Big enough to hold.
[201:46.60]Derma for alpha male.
[202:01.40]Twitter.
[202:03.28]Hello again.
[202:05.24]Things are getting pretty tense up there, aren't they?
[202:08.43]Is the night going the way you hoped it would?
[202:14.12]Uh... I mean, not really.
[202:17.69]I thought Josh was the killer.
[202:19.99]I see.
[202:21.11]And you think that these poor people are getting what they deserve?
[202:26.58]I mean, I don't know.
[202:29.84]What do you... Who are you?
[202:31.58]Like, who the fuck are you?
[202:32.60]Let's be real here.
[202:33.60]I'm trying to help you.
[202:35.85]And this game you're playing...
[202:39.11]You understand that it's not good for you.
[202:41.39]It's not good for anyone.
[202:43.49]I can't say that you're being particularly honest in the way you're playing.
[202:49.72]What?
[202:58.25]game and he's he's talking to the player this is gonna be one of those existential game within a game within a heart do you intend to continue with this elaborate self-indulgence yeah do you even believe that I am real at this point uh you you just teleported across the room so I don't think you exist
[203:28.63]The heart of the problem at all comes down to this.
[203:31.76]Can you really tell the difference anymore?
[203:37.14]Like I said, you teleported across the room into my face.
[203:41.62]Fucking Dracula.
[203:42.49]Look, it even says on it.
[203:43.55]See the little nameplate there?
[203:44.81]It said Dracula.
[203:47.51]I don't fucking trust Dracula.
[203:59.82]I'll arrest Emily.
[204:02.34]No, that's not Emily.
[204:06.80]I don't even know who that is.
[204:10.16]Dr. Acula.
[204:12.45]It said Dracula.
[204:13.79]I've just been through enough spooking for one night, okay?
[204:16.91]I see a hot bath in my crystal ball.
[204:19.51]Go have fun.
[204:19.93]Why would you do this?
[204:22.37]Oh, God!
[204:23.47]Oh, God!
[204:27.73]And he said it I did.
[204:30.74]Dread.
[204:32.10]Six hours.
[204:32.56]Until then.
[204:59.16]No, sorry buddy, that ain't, that ain't Jesus.
[205:04.05]That's somebody else, that's a dog.
[205:09.75]Mr. Wolfman.
[205:10.55]Well now I like need to know, I like, I'm gonna, what time is it?
[205:18.66]All right, we're good.
[205:20.50]I got a little, I got a little while in me.
[205:24.70]I mean, I think this game is, like, from start to finish, like, what, like, eight hours or so?
[205:30.46]We're probably gonna have to finish this game on Tuesday.
[205:34.94]I don't know.
[205:35.56]We'll see.
[205:35.98]It depends on how late we put the cycle up.
[205:44.84]Finish it tonight.
[205:47.25]I don't think that's gonna happen.
[205:49.57]I'm not gonna Google the ending.
[205:55.08]I'm just about halfway.
[205:55.98]Let's just keep going.
[205:58.18]I'm good for now.
[206:07.06]I got time.
[206:07.70]You got time.
[206:08.32]We got time.
[206:12.08]But, as the night progresses, we may need to finish this whole game here on Tuesday.
[206:26.55]Hmm, anything over here.
[206:29.01]Stuff to look at.
[206:29.55]I don't got time.
[206:33.51]Well, I like to, my Friday night streams, I like to go a little bit into the late evening, the later hours.
[206:40.68]Just because, you know, it is Friday, like Saturday's tomorrow.
[206:43.46]I'm naming days of the week now.
[206:44.64]Okay.
[206:49.62]Fortune totem.
[206:54.91]Prophecy of good fortune.
[206:57.59]Portels a possible future event.
[206:59.07]How will you determine blah blah blah?
[207:04.79]Who is that?
[207:05.48]That's Matt.
[207:06.44]But what is behind that?
[207:07.72]I don't know.
[207:13.40]We don't have enough of these totems to know anything yet.
[207:21.46]What did the bird do?
[207:25.73]That bird, like, didn't do anything.
[207:26.87]Remember, it was like, oh, the path is clear.
[207:29.53]It's the bird.
[207:31.30]I've been waiting for that.
[207:32.68]They told me, like, it was all good in the forest and shit like that, and it didn't even matter.
[207:40.08]But, yeah.
[207:40.96]Friday is good to go a little bit late, just because, you know, most people don't have to do anything tomorrow.
[207:45.65]It's the weekend.
[207:47.43]Condemned.
[207:48.05]Criminal origins.
[207:48.77]Mm-hmm.
[207:49.09]Condemned.
[207:56.53]Of course we go into the condemned building alone as this random dickhead.
[208:00.13]Who we all hated in the beginning and just like a typical story arc.
[208:06.58]You're starting to like him.
[208:08.78]He's starting to grow on you.
[208:10.72]And you actually don't want him to die.
[208:12.38]It's happening.
[208:19.35]I think.
[208:24.61]Hey, Gamesit, thanks for the bits.
[208:26.75]And, uh, System... System of... System of Fame.
[208:31.72]System of Meow.
[208:36.18]Thank you, System of Meow, for the bits.
[208:39.48]Somebody else gave two bucks, too, and I didn't... I don't... I can't see who it is.
[208:42.25]Their name got blocked out.
[208:45.27]Uh, Ugly Superhero, thank you for bits as well.
[208:49.09]Much appreciated.
[208:49.77]We got a couple of dogs chewing on some bones.
[208:54.18]Why am I being so cynical?
[208:55.10]I'm not being cynical.
[208:56.66]We're playing a horror game.
[208:57.51]We're playing a choose-who-dies horror game.
[209:01.19]I'm not being cynical.
[209:02.01]I'm being a realist.
[209:06.81]Clearly locked.
[209:07.41]Need a chapel security pass.
[209:10.29]Let's see if we can find one.
[209:16.86]Did I just get a Wizard of Oz'd?
[209:21.68]Does somebody just, like, look through there?
[209:24.45]I think so.
[209:29.05]Uh, what about... Oh, this is a big open area.
[209:34.62]Well, I think... Does that say administration?
[209:37.56]Like, admin?
[209:40.06]Yep.
[209:40.22]I have to go pet the dog.
[209:46.70]I just read the demon text out loud.
[209:53.78]Now I'm gonna fucking be in trouble at my own house.
[210:00.61]That's great.
[210:01.93]Can't wait to get visited tonight by, like, Satan.
[210:05.15]Let's open it up.
[210:16.03]come out this is money 30 clocking in name cards wait what what did that say 1952 clocking in cards a batch of 30 clocking in cards from the mine locked away in the safe this means there were 30 miners trapped in the mine
[210:45.38]Okay.
[210:48.86]Yeah, if a shitty piece of wood could open a safe, chances are you need a new safe.
[210:55.98]For your important fucking documents.
[210:57.68]Alright, let's keep looking around.
[211:01.67]Stop being so mordant.
[211:02.97]What the hell does mordant mean?
[211:04.03]I don't even know what that word means.
[211:05.07]I can't stop being something you're telling me when I don't even know the definition of the word that you're accusing me of being.
[211:13.97]Digital camera?
[211:23.88]Clown safe.
[211:24.40]I'm looking for a badge.
[211:30.63]I need my PAX badge.
[211:39.86]How do I know it's digital?
[211:41.92]This is like, isn't this like 2000?
[211:43.26]1998 or something?
[211:49.28]Medical notes.
[211:49.96]Report follows the initial state of the 12 miners after the collapse of the mine and subsequent rescue of Blackwood Pines.
[211:58.09]One of those guys actually tried to bite me.
[211:59.73]I'm going to report it to Dr. Bowen.
[212:03.17]Wait, what was the doctor's name?
[212:05.19]Our doctor's name was close to Dracula.
[212:09.17]That's Dracula.
[212:10.21]That's not the same.
[212:11.01]Okay.
[212:22.39]No.
[212:23.95]No key card in here.
[212:28.05]There's another room.
[212:28.75]Is this door open?
[212:33.42]It's a door.
[212:34.16]I don't think I can go in it though.
[212:39.44]How's your night?
[212:39.96]My night is going great.
[212:40.86]Hope your night is going good too.
[212:43.76]We're playing scary choose your own... You know.

[213:13.85]You can use that.
[213:25.78]At least I have a weapon now.
[213:28.66]So that's good.
[213:36.04]How could you ever stay?
[213:37.20]Even if you were a murderer.
[213:40.00]This place is scary no matter what.
[213:42.36]Even if you are a serial killer.
[213:46.18]This is a scary place.
[213:47.19]You'd be scared down here.
[213:50.05]Huh?
[213:50.73]Huh?
[213:54.83]How many days will they keep us here?
[214:00.00]Are they talking about the miners?
[214:02.50]Some, like, government experiment where they, like, syringed everybody and made them all weird or something.
[214:12.78]This light is gonna be... He's gonna pop up.
[214:15.12]There's a dog.
[214:15.88]It's alright.
[214:16.38]Skeleton.
[214:19.26]Skeleton.
[214:23.54]A bunch of random shit.
[214:29.26]What?
[214:29.58]Why?
[214:29.92]Who?
[214:30.32]Why?
[214:30.54]Who?
[214:42.17]The rat.
[214:44.93]I'm okay with rats.
[214:53.99]Is that person alive?
[214:59.59]No.
[215:01.43]It's just somebody got put in the meat grinder, and the meat grinder got clogged.
[215:06.35]Alright, let's see who's in the meat grinder.
[215:08.89]Oh, whoa, whoa.
[215:10.31]Is this what he was feeding them?
[215:14.09]Oh, wait!
[215:14.55]What happened?
[215:15.57]God damn it!
[215:18.73]Shit, I just wanted to see who was in the fucking meat grinder.
[215:22.37]And I got a trap.
[215:23.09]I got fucking pranked.
[215:26.87]I'm telling you, it's all about pranks.
[215:28.33]I gotta cut the finger off.
[215:30.43]Do it.
[215:31.67]You have to do it.
[215:34.84]I know you don't want to, but you have to.
[215:36.58]And you're gonna be... Amputate, amputate.
[215:39.22]No time.
[215:39.82]You gotta go.
[215:41.82]Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit.
[216:06.14]Okay we're good.
[216:09.16]First aid.
[216:14.47]That's a sharp machete.
[216:15.55]What?
[216:16.99]I think you might be suffering from a little too much blood loss there, Michael.
[216:39.23]Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
[216:41.69]Catch a tiger by the toe.
[216:44.07]I just chopped off my fucking hand.
[216:50.75]This place is kind of swanky.
[216:55.01]Imagine you open up your hotel room door.
[216:58.93]Oh, wow, I heard about this place.
[216:59.99]It's got like four stars on Yelp.
[217:01.49]Like, just check out the room, honey.
[217:04.01]Oh, wow, cool.
[217:06.23]What is this, the bathroom over here?
[217:07.27]Wow, this is a swanky table.
[217:14.43]Whose fingers are those?
[217:19.45]This place just gets better and better.
[217:23.02]Do you guys like my... Oof.
[217:28.86]Uh-oh.
[217:34.27]That's a close-up of some celled organism.
[217:36.67]I'm gonna lose my other hand.
[217:41.47]I would laugh my ass off if I lost the other hand.
[217:51.72]Somebody was cooking this blanket.
[217:57.46]Registration of death.
[217:59.20]Sarah Smith.
[218:01.19]Severe lacerations.
[218:02.83]Sarah Smith.
[218:05.10]Body was not discovered until six to eight hours after death.
[218:08.58]Sections of the intestines and kidneys were apparently eaten by the attacker.
[218:12.48]Eaten, by the way, is underlined in all capitals.
[218:18.80]Wow, take a look at that.
[218:19.94]Wow, honey, take a look at this bed.
[218:21.32]It's real fucking swanky.
[218:22.52]I'm going to lose the other hand.
[218:27.30]Please lose the other hand.
[218:32.07]Oh, wow, somebody's still in this bed, honey.
[218:35.07]Somebody's still in this one.
[218:37.17]You know, you're gonna have to call downstairs to the fucking front desk.
[218:40.61]There's still a person sleeping in my bed.
[218:44.65]In fact, they may have been dead for like nine years.
[218:47.02]Heh heh heh heh.
[219:02.01]Ooh, punch card.
[219:03.11]Oh, now my AC turned on.
[219:10.24]It's like pumping AC upstairs, but not in my room, and it's just being loud.
[219:13.76]Yeah.
[219:17.52]Good joke.
[219:17.90]How does your hand feel?
[219:32.13]Do it!
[219:33.69]Oh my god, do it!
[219:34.63]There's another door to open upstairs, but let's just go.
[219:54.23]I can only go up.
[219:56.69]Stop teasing the punch card.
[220:06.06]That's a mangled hand.
[220:08.28]God damn it, you fucking dog.
[220:11.42]What the fuck?
[220:15.40]Wait a minute.
[220:16.63]Guys.
[220:17.67]I don't think that's clown vision that we've been seeing this whole time.
[220:20.71]I think that might be like dog vision.
[220:25.61]That's like a big red dog.
[220:29.87]No quick time events yet, by the way.
[220:31.59]Yeah, I think it might be dog vision.
[220:44.00]This person's just nonchalantly walking around.
[220:54.97]I wish he said swanky.
[220:56.09]Isn't this a swanky little crib?
[220:58.67]I would have fucking dropped the controller and just left.
[221:01.10]I would have just left the stream turned on until tomorrow and just walked away.
[221:13.62]Why can't dogs have clown vision?
[221:15.16]I mean, it's not that they can't.
[221:19.22]I still have the punch card, right?
[221:24.66]So I can open this door.
[221:28.62]There was an unopenable door here.
[221:36.55]I did that one on purpose.
[221:38.71]That was on purpose.
[221:42.55]Take it back.
[221:44.04]Wow, uh, we just used our hotel key.
[221:46.74]You know, that was our hotel key we just used, honey.
[221:48.93]Let's take a look inside our new room.
[221:50.91]Punch him!
[221:52.83]Punch him!
[221:53.61]Punch him!
[222:06.92]I didn't even, I didn't need to punch him.
[222:08.38]Okay.
[222:21.15]I act okay He's friendly Or at least he's friendly okay, maybe not friendly enough.
[222:27.81]Should I approach him?
[222:29.93]I'm gonna approach him Should I not do this?
[222:34.42]See, he's just a friendly dog.
[222:36.27]Don't lose the other hand.
[222:37.31]I'm gonna lose the other hand.
[222:40.63]He's gonna bite me in the face.
[222:43.07]I'm gonna get bit in the face.
[222:45.35]I'm gonna get bit in the face.
[222:49.34]What are you doing?
[222:51.98]You know you're not supposed to do that with any dog?
[222:54.12]Put your face that close?
[222:55.40]They don't like that.
[222:56.02]No dog likes that.
[222:56.90]You know, like a dog psychologist.
[222:58.26]I'm a dog psychologist.
[223:06.73]Thank you, Aeon, or, uh, Aeon, for the ten bucks.
[223:10.55]That's a swanky ten dollar scale.
[223:12.46]Thank you.
[223:14.40]Thank you for the ten bucks.
[223:18.40]What if I just keep petting him?
[223:19.44]He'll be my friend, right?
[223:20.44]Eventually?
[223:21.08]Like, he'll be best friends?
[223:22.24]Okay, so, I did that right.
[223:26.67]Now he's gonna help.
[223:32.81]He's like a good friend now.
[223:34.77]Okay, let's do this one more time just to make sure we have him solidified as a best friend.
[223:39.52]Okay, good.
[223:42.42]Just stay there until the police arrive petting the dog.
[223:52.60]Uh, what's this?
[223:53.84]Is this a totem?
[223:59.33]It's a jacket.
[224:00.19]It's their jacket.
[224:02.10]They drink a lot of monster energy, apparently.
[224:06.10]Why would I put it on?
[224:11.82]Oh, there's a gun there, too.
[224:13.32]I'm not going to be able to reach that.
[224:20.13]Maybe I will.
[224:23.37]That was perfect.
[224:24.29]Cool.
[224:25.57]That's a gun.
[224:31.54]Alright, now I can protect myself.
[224:34.84]I'm OK with this.
[224:41.24]TV.
[224:45.74]This guy's got like a weird board of a bunch of fucked up shit.
[224:48.64]Clue found clippings on the wall.
[224:51.27]14 missing in mountains.
[224:54.63]Are we the miners?
[224:58.63]Take a look at that picture down there.
[224:59.61]That's like us, right?
[225:02.09]No, it's not.
[225:03.07]It's not us.
[225:07.01]Liars.
[225:07.53]Local man found out.
[225:08.27]So there's obviously a very pissed off miner.
[225:11.59]Who was like forgotten down here and left.
[225:13.01]It's one of us.
[225:14.91]One of us is a miner and we just didn't tell.
[225:18.53]Brought all of our friends out here.
[225:19.95]So.
[225:21.57]He's a smoker.
[225:24.09]See our box.
[225:24.87]They smoke.
[225:25.55]Who smokes in the group?
[225:26.41]I don't know.
[225:30.39]Somebody's a smoker.
[225:38.77]I don't remember who, like, actually smoked during this whole thing.
[225:50.08]Just smoked a cigar.
[225:51.04]Alright, hopefully this isn't a mimic chest.
[225:55.22]You know, you guys know exactly what I mean by that.
[225:57.26]I don't have to explain what that means.
[226:04.31]No, it wasn't a mimic.
[226:05.41]Okay, that's good.
[226:07.63]Oh, dog bone.
[226:09.29]Cool.
[226:10.23]I'm gonna go feed him.
[226:16.53]So, now this will actually solidify that the dog and I are best friends.
[226:23.82]There he is.
[226:24.16]Come here, buddy.
[226:26.88]I got a treat for you.
[226:30.58]Take it.
[226:33.20]Take this delicious bone.
[226:38.84]Here.
[226:40.42]Easy, boy.
[226:42.62]Easy.
[226:44.70]All right, cool.
[226:48.56]Yeah, good boy.
[226:50.78]Who needs friends when you have a dog?
[226:53.05]I know, right?
[226:55.77]I've spent more time with this dog, making sure the dog is cool, than I have actual people that are getting killed by the murderer.
[227:07.62]It is currently on sub only, yes.
[227:10.10]To avoid spoilers.
[227:12.36]Because apparently there was spoilerinos in the chat earlier.
[227:16.76]And we have decided that we're going to have sub only.
[227:20.08]So sorry.
[227:21.22]Don't shoot.
[227:21.72]What?
[227:23.18]I don't want to shoot the gun.
[227:24.21]Why?
[227:24.59]How many bullets are in the gun?
[227:26.77]How do I go back?
[227:29.95]Oh, come on.
[227:32.91]If there's one bullet in this gun, I swear...
[227:36.72]I didn't even check how many fucking bullets are in there.
[227:39.80]Damn it.
[227:40.06]Oh, well.
[227:47.62]Uh, in here?
[227:48.44]Well, let's check this way first.
[227:55.85]Anything of interest?
[227:56.57]There's a light switch over there.
[227:57.73]No, I can't go over there.
[227:58.83]Whatever.
[228:04.00]Mm-hmm.
[228:09.43]Why should we find the other dogs?
[228:14.69]Make friends with all his dogs, and then... Does it say 1925?
[228:21.09]1952?
[228:25.31]There we are.
[228:29.26]There are the kids.
[228:32.16]There we are.
[228:39.15]So they left a miner behind.
[228:40.53]That's for sure.
[228:45.68]The story's getting pieced together very slowly.
[228:47.48]Another totem.
[228:48.54]This is the top of one of the totems.
[228:55.57]Alright.
[228:57.35]So, that's me dying.
[229:02.93]Who else is in there?
[229:11.09]Okay, so that's going to be one of the miners.
[229:17.42]Yeah, but there were 30 miners, so... Okay, there's definitely a crazed miner madman, and I'm going to have to sacrifice... That's what that was.
[229:24.94]I was sacrificing myself to, like, blow up the crazy miner guy.
[229:28.72]I think.
[229:35.48]yeah so make sure you don't light any uh fire down here even though I'm holding a fire in my hand the dog is painfully far away from me now so like I think that was often nothing I'm glad I'm so invested in the story
[230:02.56]Well, all we know so far is that there were 30 miners.
[230:04.62]12 of them got saved.
[230:06.50]12 of them... Like 15 or 14 of them didn't make it out.
[230:11.10]We had a problem where Hannah and Beth were killed last year.
[230:16.15]And, you know, it's the one year anniversary.
[230:20.65]And we're here celebrating something.
[230:23.43]It was somebody's birthday.
[230:26.16]And hopefully this is not a mimic bucket.
[230:29.68]It's not.
[230:31.93]Oh, another gunshot.
[230:37.70]I feel like this is not a good- I feel like I'm wasting bullets.
[230:42.32]Oh, fuck.
[230:46.51]Oh, wait, wait.
[230:48.85]Oh, god.
[230:50.55]Wait, hold on!
[230:52.71]Did I- did I just pop it?
[230:57.92]Oh, no.
[231:04.77]Who's watching?
[231:07.42]I know, I told you there was two people.
[231:11.69]That's Josh 2.
[231:16.45]The totem was right, except it wasn't a lighter.
[231:18.49]It was a gun.
[231:19.39]Reality TV.
[231:20.61]That guy's just a shitty security guard.
[231:22.99]He's not even a killer.
[231:24.99]He's just not doing his job.
[231:26.13]He's being paid.
[231:26.83]Yes, so do I.
[231:49.16]Clue found.
[231:49.79]Axe.
[231:54.05]Let's see.
[231:54.55]An axe stuck to the door of the cable car station.
[231:56.29]Definitely wasn't there before.
[231:58.99]The mystery man smokes.
[232:01.11]16 years I waited to kill you.
[232:02.87]There's an axe holder.
[232:07.46]There's an axe.
[232:07.98]There's a pig.
[232:10.34]Okay.
[232:11.54]30 miners, 30 clues.
[232:12.48]These are... I got it.
[232:16.03]I got it.
[232:17.41]30 miners.
[232:19.29]Every single one of these is a different person.
[232:22.30]Every one of these clues is one miner.
[232:26.41]One miner smokes.
[232:27.89]One miner has problems misplacing things.
[232:30.83]One of them was wanted for a crime.
[232:32.26]Somebody has a grudge.
[232:34.14]One of them has some type of medical problem.
[232:36.00]The other one likes to do calligraphy.
[232:38.20]One of them was thinking about getting tattoos.
[232:39.60]The other one eats pork and does not like animals.
[232:42.47]The other one uses an axe.
[232:43.55]Figured it all out.
[232:44.13]Got the whole thing solved.
[232:49.42]30 minors.
[232:49.76]30 clues.
[232:49.96]Smash the fucking door!
[232:50.52]Let's see some action!
[232:51.64]Let's see some action here.
[232:52.72]Break the door down.
[233:34.12]Oh, no, I got it stuck.
[233:36.82]Oh, honey, I don't know what to do.
[233:38.50]We're good.
[233:52.37]What's with the sign?
[233:53.25]This is taking too long.
[233:56.85]Don't touch the lights.
[234:00.92]Damn.
[234:02.66]What happened?
[234:04.82]This is crazy.
[234:05.86]We were here just a few hours ago.
[234:07.14]They got in here and broke some shit.
[234:08.18]This must have just happened.
[234:09.58]What the fuck is going on?
[234:10.86]It's got to be the guy, though, the one who got to Chris and Ash and Josh.
[234:15.18]He's got to know this is the only way back.
[234:17.56]Don't say that.
[234:18.94]What does it say on his eyes?
[234:21.00]Look, the cable car's all the way out there.
[234:24.05]You can jump?
[234:26.85]You can jump to the car?
[234:33.50]That car was like a hundred feet out.
[234:39.06]Unless you got fucking Spider-Man blood, you ain't going that way.
[234:41.94]Oh my god, I can't believe that fucking Reaper was here.
[234:51.73]You know that game, Overwatch?
[234:54.49]Die, die, die.
[234:57.92]Wow.
[235:00.06]Come on.
[235:02.06]That was so good.
[235:09.10]Well, whatever.
[235:09.70]Funny streamer.
[235:10.88]Yeah, that was a funny streamer joke.
[235:20.52]Ranger path.
[235:23.13]I guess we're going to have to go there.
[235:24.47]Okay.
[235:25.09]Unfollow.
[235:25.31]Die, die, die.
[235:26.81]Funny.
[235:29.31]Unfollow.
[235:45.87]There's something on the ground that I'd like to look at.
[235:47.50]You're kind of standing in the way.
[235:50.62]Look at all this crap.
[235:51.56]There's got to be something useful in here, right?
[235:53.24]I'm about to axe you if you don't get out of the way.
[235:57.22]Let's get out of the way.
[235:58.11]Come over here, please.
[235:59.87]The shiny thing on the ground I want to look at.
[236:01.41]I think you need to be out of the way.
[236:06.33]What?
[236:06.63]What?
[236:10.08]speed can no it's big speed control great no keys no cable car so back to square one what about the fire tower on the map fire tower we gotta trek our asses to the fire tower or something I mean it would wouldn't it probably yeah matt we gotta get to that radio
[236:35.85]pick the lock.
[236:37.82]Uh, let's, yeah, I agree.
[236:39.62]It's a good idea.
[236:41.14]Good idea.
[236:41.54]It's a quick way to get yourself killed, Emily.
[237:03.77]Because the very fast way for you to not live is to have that much, uh, cockiness in your, uh, in your bloodstream.
[237:10.95]Oh!
[237:11.69]Hold up.
[237:15.25]And she falls.
[237:16.35]I would love it.
[237:18.21]No, of course.
[237:19.11]Let me go.
[237:22.30]Ten fingers.
[237:22.76]That's cooking good looking.
[237:24.70]Getting us out of here, Mr. Meat for Brains.
[237:26.76]Meat for... Lime it.
[237:36.23]Is this game based on a sitcom?
[237:39.27]No, but there's a VR game that's connected to this, though.
[237:46.84]Taking a very long time.
[237:49.92]I thought I could jump from there.
[237:53.40]Look at this bad boy.
[237:54.38]You coming with me, buddy?
[237:55.80]There's a VR game connected to this.
[237:57.26]It's like an offshoot.
[237:59.10]Then just like magic, come on down.
[238:00.88]We can totally get out of here this way.
[238:09.29]What?
[238:11.14]Yeah, maybe you should go first.
[238:22.72]I got it, guys.
[238:25.75]Everybody calm down.
[238:26.79]Nothing would have happened anyway.
[238:28.21]She would have just fallen down into, like, the Borderlands graphics.
[238:31.83]It'd be okay.
[238:32.61]It's just, like, made it a puff pastry.
[238:38.07]Okay.
[238:41.33]Protect me from gravity, Matt.
[238:42.27]Holy cannoli, thank God that's over.
[238:43.57]Yeah, for real.
[238:47.23]Whew.
[238:50.64]Shouldn't have just killed her.
[238:54.28]No, that would have been a lame way for this person to go.
[239:00.58]What if it doesn't work?
[239:01.77]What?
[239:02.63]The radio.
[239:03.27]It'll work.
[239:04.47]But...
[239:07.56]Plan is the thing in my hand.
[239:08.96]The axe.
[239:10.52]You don't need a plan when you're holding an axe.
[239:13.81]All the greatest minds.
[239:15.11]All the greatest conquerors of our time.
[239:31.10]Didn't need a plan.
[239:31.76]They were holding an axe.
[239:34.34]George Washington.
[239:36.90]Holds an axe.
[239:37.44]Teddy Roosevelt.
[239:38.22]Axe in his hand.
[239:39.36]Think about it.
[239:39.82]Napoleon.
[240:02.38]One of the most famous paintings of Napoleon.
[240:05.84]Got a fucking axe in his hand.
[240:08.69]Just like this one.
[240:17.11]Dark Souls!
[240:19.45]What's the best weapon in Dark Souls?
[240:21.76]The axe.
[240:27.46]watch where you step around here danger given the choice I prefer not to spend my evening plummeting to my death off a snowy cliff top okay danger cliff okay well that's let's just keep moving this really is dark so we're gonna get picked up by those weird bat people I don't
[240:56.13]Where did this come from?
[240:58.19]Looks like a stampede of deer?
[241:00.35]Why do the animals have this, like, weird sentience?
[241:10.52]What did you think about just this that I just showed you?
[241:13.12]Did you think it was fucking weird?
[241:15.10]No?
[241:15.56]Okay, we're back here.
[241:22.96]T- Uh, Beethoven.
[241:26.70]had an axe in his hand while he was playing the piano.
[241:39.08]Yeah, by the way, how long has she been in the bath?
[241:44.49]She took a bath like 12 hours ago.
[241:49.03]What are you doing out there?
[241:52.19]Creepy.
[241:55.57]If you were in the bath for this long, you would have to go to the doctor.
[241:59.33]You would get, like, water poisoning.
[242:02.77]That's a thing, right?
[242:04.14]Your skin would become, like, moth skin.
[242:09.60]If somebody, like, put their finger on you, your, like, skin would come off.
[242:12.62]You would have, like, moth skin.
[242:17.35]Wait, we're losing the stream?
[242:19.85]What happened?
[242:20.33]The stream's crapping out?
[242:25.34]We good?
[242:26.54]Did I blue screen again?
[242:29.79]No, we're good.
[242:31.87]Okay, good.
[242:32.49]Good.
[242:32.77]Okay.
[242:34.21]Okay, we're good.
[242:36.93]This girl was just listening to, like, fucking Bach in the bathtub for 12 hours.
[242:41.90]Alright, what's over here?
[242:43.56]I want to look at that thing.
[242:44.32]I took the clothes.
[242:45.94]Oh.
[242:46.00]What is it?
[242:46.48]Is this one sock?
[242:56.11]You could make that into clothes.
[242:58.39]Yeah, you could do that.
[243:00.03]Just put your, like, one leg through it and pull it up.
[243:03.31]And then just hold your hands over your boobs.
[243:06.29]You could make that one sock into an article of clothing.
[243:07.97]You could.
[243:11.14]I could make that into an article of clothing.
[243:12.66]And that would be totally appropriate.
[243:13.86]I don't need to give you any details.
[243:19.38]Let's go.
[243:23.56]You got here for the best part of the whole game.
[243:28.17]Hmm.
[243:30.47]Why did you take my clothes?
[243:33.41]This is so stupid!
[243:37.72]Why don't you be like the fucking caribous that did it?
[243:42.20]Another prank.
[243:42.84]Ding dong.
[243:53.79]Oh.
[243:57.00]Which one of you guys interrupted my sleep bath?
[244:01.20]You know, the bath that I take when I go to bed for the whole night.
[244:04.59]Don't walk into the corner.
[244:06.53]What's with the balloons?
[244:08.35]Why am I getting GTA arrows?
[244:26.81]Come this way for the balloon party.
[244:28.93]Yeah, here we go.
[244:34.89]Gonna have to fight a guy in a towel.
[244:41.87]I've lost control.
[244:42.83]Here comes a QTE.
[244:46.60]Yep.
[244:50.40]Who's even still left in the house, is what I want to know.
[244:52.66]I don't know.
[245:00.19]Hey!
[245:01.61]Guys, come on!
[245:02.51]I'm done with this!
[245:04.13]I really don't appreciate the silent treatment here!
[245:09.74]Now you have to watch my shitty independent film that I made!
[245:12.86]Hello, Samantha.
[245:14.26]It's the worst of all!
[245:15.56]Looking for me?
[245:21.41]I don't think you'll have much luck by looking, Samantha.
[245:25.49]You're only going to see what I want you to see.
[245:29.05]And I have quite a lot to show you.
[245:31.29]It's going on.
[245:33.59]Open your eyes.
[245:36.28]Oh my god.
[245:38.14]She's quite beautiful, isn't she?
[245:41.32]What are you doing out there?
[245:42.62]That's some really good angles.
[245:44.12]Why do you think she has any idea what lies ahead?
[245:48.48]Do you think these were the last
[245:58.19]What camera is this?
[245:59.81]Was he standing in front of her?
[246:01.31]That guy had to have been standing in front of her with the camera.
[246:09.72]Oh, God.
[246:10.16]What do I do?
[246:11.26]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[246:14.10]Please, no!
[246:15.66]It's a clown with a syringe!
[246:19.37]It's a clown with a syringe!
[246:25.51]We got it!
[246:26.43]We finally got the fucking clown with the syringe in his hand.
[246:35.22]We actually got it.
[246:36.80]I can't believe it.
[246:37.60]Where are the spiders?
[246:38.84]Where are the spiders, please?
[246:42.88]No, don't hide.
[246:43.68]Fucking go.
[246:44.43]Are you serious?
[246:45.19]That's how you die.
[246:47.59]Where are the spiders?
[246:51.50]Okay, we gotta get Game of the Century.
[246:53.42]Remember I told you that was gonna be the case?
[246:54.82]That was just gonna be the game of the fucking year?
[246:59.52]Game of the fucking year, even though this game came out, like, three years ago.
[247:04.94]That's so fucking funny.
[247:06.74]That makes me so happy.
[247:08.68]They actually make, like, the clown guy have the syringe.
[247:22.24]Are you kidding me?
[247:23.34]No handle?
[247:26.22]Get a wine bottle up.
[247:28.52]Come on.
[247:32.92]Oh, no.
[247:33.44]Now I can step over this.
[247:37.77]Come on.
[247:39.27]Get it in there.
[247:40.11]Here comes the surrender.
[247:53.34]Go.
[247:53.74]Go.
[247:54.22]Don't stop.
[248:01.20]Oh, that's so funny.
[248:04.51]I'm so happy about that.
[248:06.77]Words cannot even describe it.
[248:11.31]This, like, obstacle course.
[248:18.09]He's gonna run from straight.
[248:19.47]It's gonna be like a high... Here it comes.
[248:21.00]Right there.
[248:21.84]Nope.
[248:25.19]You have to keep moving, right?
[248:26.75]You just have to keep moving.
[248:27.91]You can't hide.
[248:28.71]Hiding is not good because it keeps you... Oh, I just got serrated.
[248:32.43]I'm dead.
[248:32.99]So sorry.
[248:47.02]Now, that was exciting, wasn't it?
[248:50.01]Well done.
[248:53.15]The game seems to be going very well.
[248:56.83]Yes.
[248:57.97]If I could do it all again, guys.
[248:59.89]All the good work we did exploring the source of your fear.
[249:04.77]I would do it all again.
[249:05.49]And you've just gone and used it for ill.
[249:09.97]Mm-hmm.
[249:10.35]You've run.
[249:10.77]You've got me to run.
[249:11.69]There's a snake in there.
[249:14.75]You've turned it against these people who you so desperately want to torment.
[249:20.14]Has it been worth it?
[249:35.31]What is Dracula?
[249:36.03]Now I'm like invested.
[249:38.55]Stop it, you can't do this!
[249:41.51]What are you talking about?
[249:45.13]There's a maniac!
[249:45.91]Oh my god, we gotta get out of here.
[249:47.29]I don't understand what happened.
[249:48.51]There's a maniac!
[249:49.45]This is insane, we need to go get some help.
[249:52.33]Hello?
[249:54.46]Guys?
[249:56.16]Hello, Samantha.
[249:58.54]Looking for me?
[250:01.20]We should look for the others.
[250:03.00]Mike and Jess are off 69-ing each other, and who knows where Sam is.
[250:06.02]I think she's in the lodge.
[250:07.10]Why are we still talking about this?
[250:08.36]Let's go!
[250:10.80]Hey, look.
[250:11.22]Fire tower.
[250:13.20]Alright, well here's what we're gonna do.
[250:16.45]I'm gonna go pee, and we're gonna do one more chapter.
[250:18.09]We're gonna get through one more full chapter, and then I'm going to finish this on Tuesday, because I'm invested we're gonna finish this game.
[250:29.77]Wait, hold on.
[250:30.57]Matt.
[250:32.19]Five hours to go.
[250:34.33]What are you going to do?
[250:36.07]What do we do here?
[250:37.67]Calm, stay calm, get a hold of yourself.
[250:39.29]Calm.
[250:39.43]You've got to be calm here.
[250:40.23]You don't want to startle an animal.
[250:41.77]Stay calm.
[250:43.41]Relax.
[250:44.31]They're just deer.
[250:45.41]Don't startle animals.
[250:46.27]They could react unpredictable.
[250:48.11]No, no, no, Matt.
[250:48.87]They're going to hurt us.
[250:50.81]Just be calm.
[250:53.01]He wants me to move.
[250:58.25]Matt.
[250:59.46]That was easy.
[251:03.84]Okay.
[251:04.34]Do you still have the axe?
[251:10.82]What's the point of this?
[251:19.20]Am I about to be knighted?
[251:20.26]There's power before us.
[251:23.04]The animal kingdom respects you.
[251:26.83]Wait.
[251:28.03]No, don't, don't, no.
[251:31.13]Why would I smash his head with an axe?
[251:33.95]I'm surrounded by them.
[251:39.51]That would be the biggest mistake of all time.
[251:49.58]That's a guaranteed death.
[251:51.28]I would hit one in the face.
[251:55.09]and die.
[251:55.51]Alright, I gotta pee.
[251:56.21]Hold on.
[251:57.29]I'll be right back.
[251:58.46]Last pee of the evening.
[252:00.32]And then we're gonna do this chapter, and once we're done with this full chapter, we're gonna call it.
[252:04.95]I'll be right back.
[253:49.31]Wait, what?
[255:00.27]The hell are you guys doing in here?
[255:03.71]What are you guys doing?
[255:04.93]What's with this emote spam?
[255:09.35]Just spamming emotes now?
[255:12.03]Is that what we've become as a stream?
[255:14.36]And Italics just got a full Jupiter.
[255:16.42]How?
[255:17.92]How the fuck did you do that?
[255:20.72]How do you always do that?
[255:23.78]Well, thank you, Ahon, again for the $12 now.
[255:28.04]and they just gave two bucks they said two dollar joke it was a good two dollar joke that okay can I just say that lincoln joke well that like a joke crossed the line a little you know sometimes you like walk the line very slowly and I like I stepped over it a little you know it's been like a hundred years that's okay it's been a hundred years I can make it a lincoln joke right
[256:02.34]All right, let's finish this chapter up, and then we're going to call it a night.
[256:05.70]So let's hope something interesting happens in this particular chapter.
[256:13.33]If we do manage to get someone on the radio, then we tell them we need help.
[256:17.29]A hundred years?
[256:18.37]What do we do while we wait?
[256:19.69]We go back to the lodge and get everyone else.
[256:22.53]When did Lincoln die?
[256:23.37]Lincoln died like 400, 500 years ago?
[256:24.51]We should stay here in case whoever it is needs to get back in touch with us.
[256:28.50]Let's get that radio working first.
[256:31.00]When was the American Revolution?
[256:32.73]That's when Lincoln died, right?
[256:34.07]He died like in the... No, he died... The Civil... Whatever.
[256:37.95]You know what I'm talking about.
[256:39.53]It comes to loud ass air conditioner, by the way.
[256:43.95]I apologize.
[256:44.31]It was like 1740, right?
[256:44.83]So like what?
[256:45.23]100, 200 years ago?
[256:45.75]180 years ago?
[257:05.59]1400 B.C.
[257:05.81]Keep going.
[257:12.64]I can't get over the clown with the syringes.
[257:17.38]I can't get over it.
[257:18.24]This game's great.
[257:20.20]What a great fucking game.
[257:22.26]What a fucking gem.
[257:24.72]Nobody seems to care about it.
[257:27.06]What a fucking gem of a video game.
[257:28.99]I told you guys I was going to say that too.
[257:31.54]If they gave me the clown with the syringe, this is like top 10 best video games ever.
[257:49.39]Wait, is that- What are you doing?
[257:52.41]Don't- Don't drop the axe?
[257:56.16]Why did he drop the axe?
[257:56.92]You can't climb.
[257:57.80]What's happening here?
[258:03.30]I can climb that with one hand.
[258:04.54]Why were you dropping the axe?
[258:06.34]Go back down there and get it.
[258:07.33]What do you mean nobody cares?
[258:11.61]People went nuts over this game.
[258:12.95]I'm just kidding.
[258:17.79]I'm just kidding.
[258:23.65]I know this is a popular game.
[258:24.79]Why is it so windy all of a sudden?
[258:27.05]We're almost inside.
[258:32.03]L1 is fast walk.
[258:33.15]I have been doing L1 for the most part of the stream.
[258:36.53]The majority of the stream I've been doing L1.
[258:42.59]Did Lincoln actually have an axe in his hand in any of those old pictures?
[258:46.37]He probably did.
[258:52.18]I'm telling you, the greatest minds in the world, in some form, have been photographed with an axe in their hand.
[259:00.47]Okay, her hair looked white.
[259:01.77]I thought she's aged like 60 years.
[259:13.77]There.
[259:16.10]I don't have a weapon anymore, though, unfortunately.
[259:21.06]Can I complain and say that it's kind of stupid that the only time I was able to use the axe was to try to kill an animal?
[259:29.42]That's it?
[259:30.12]That's what you're going to give me for an X?
[259:32.44]Gameplay?
[259:36.32]Missing Hannah.
[259:38.81]Well, I know she's dead.
[259:44.91]Lincoln photographed with an X. Let me see.
[259:46.23]Let me see.
[259:49.99]I want you to look at that.
[259:52.52]Lincoln with a fucking X. Take a look at that link.
[259:55.82]That's how it's posted.
[260:01.59]That is a historical fucking document.
[260:03.85]Right there.
[260:09.95]There we go.
[260:15.54]Alright, there's the missing person.
[260:19.16]Here's the radio.
[260:20.56]I'm not gonna use that yet.
[260:21.40]Probably gonna start a bunch of shit if I do that.
[260:23.87]Fax machine.
[260:24.67]Send the fax.
[260:26.78]So, no power.
[260:28.84]There's no power.
[260:29.52]Go turn the generator on.
[260:30.48]I'm gonna be mad.
[260:31.06]Don't tell me that.
[260:37.02]No power.
[260:38.02]Fuck.
[260:38.62]Shit.
[260:43.17]Great.
[260:43.85]No power.
[260:46.17]Gotta be a... Genuine Lincoln picture.
[260:51.65]Wait, why are you disappointed?
[260:57.20]Why are you disappointed?
[261:00.53]What happened?
[261:01.79]Imagine if I had been standing right next to her.
[261:08.61]Imagine if the other guy was standing to the left.
[261:11.47]You would become like a squished silly putty person.
[261:14.47]I wish that was the case.
[261:15.51]That is so fucking funny.
[261:17.75]Fuse box.
[261:18.28]Let's do it.
[261:25.85]No, well.
[261:33.88]Okay, we'll go over here.
[261:41.16]Any other clues?
[261:42.18]Emergency flare.
[261:44.50]Let's get this just before shit goes down.
[261:49.38]And if somebody's already on fire, we'll get a nice critical hit.
[261:56.17]Uh, give her the mat.
[262:01.02]I don't trust her with this.
[262:02.98]Wait.
[262:06.66]Why do you... Don't... You're using it now?
[262:09.26]What are you using it now for?
[262:13.69]What the fuck would you use it now for?
[262:16.57]You just gave away your location.
[262:26.44]Sort of cute.
[262:29.57]Well, let's try to fax something, though.
[262:32.61]I'm not sure what we're supposed to fax.
[262:33.99]I don't know what this is.
[262:36.41]No.
[262:36.73]Okay, what is it?
[262:38.89]It's a photo of somebody with an axe.
[262:41.60]Nope.
[262:44.38]Beth Washington.
[262:45.36]She's missing.
[262:46.26]Mm-hmm.
[262:50.02]It's gonna be some... What is he doing?
[262:54.80]They're probably the killers or something.
[262:56.62]You know, it's going to be one of those cases of... Nothing.
[263:05.23]Signal spring.
[263:05.73]Turn it back.
[263:13.77]We got a Ranger.
[263:18.82]Hello?
[263:20.67]Anyone there?
[263:21.39]Hello?
[263:22.91]Please say something if you're out there, please.
[263:24.97]We need help.
[263:25.87]Over, over.
[263:28.04]Shit.
[263:28.56]By the way, today's lunch is macaroni and cheese.
[263:32.00]Yeah, I got it.
[263:32.76]Slow.
[263:33.16]That's probably not even a real ranger.
[264:04.66]This is somebody... The call is coming from inside the house.
[264:07.24]I'm not identifying myself.
[264:08.08]I don't know if I want to do this.
[264:09.20]Because this might just be him intercepting the call.
[264:11.28]Whatever.
[264:34.59]This is a mistake.
[264:35.35]We're on Blackwood Mountain by the ski lodge.
[264:37.55]There's a killer, and he's after us.
[264:39.49]He's already killed one of our friends.
[264:42.39]Oh, God, please help.
[264:44.39]You've got to help us.
[264:48.09]I knew it.
[264:49.22]That was a bad idea.
[264:50.00]I knew it.
[264:52.60]He was intercepting the call.
[264:54.34]He was pretending to be the property ranger.
[264:56.06]I read you, ma'am.
[264:56.54]Please do not leave your position.
[264:59.54]We will send out helicopters.
[265:10.88]Dawn.
[265:14.94]That doesn't show the title screen.
[265:17.58]He's coming for me.
[265:19.22]He's going to rip open and it's going to be Until Dawn.
[265:24.55]Roll it.
[265:25.03]That's Jurassic Park.
[265:25.97]Did somebody just fall?
[265:28.95]What was that explosion?
[265:41.50]Alright, it's time to ditch her.
[265:49.60]The first person that panics usually is the one that has to go.
[265:58.05]Fire.
[265:58.47]Do I get an opportunity to do anything here?
[266:03.11]No, save yourself.
[266:04.21]She's gone.
[266:11.52]No, it don't matter, it's done.
[266:13.34]Alright, well, you get... Oh, jeez, she's gonna get hit with a toaster!
[266:22.53]Okay, she actually got hit with a toaster.
[266:27.24]That's okay.
[266:44.59]Alright, we're good.
[266:58.72]Just have to get out easily and slowly.
[267:02.15]Can you repeat that please?
[267:08.63]I didn't hear you.
[267:10.46]All I heard was, ah, fuck, damn it.
[267:13.33]Everything okay up there?
[267:15.35]We'll see you at dawn.
[267:18.79]Matt!
[267:19.41]Oh, God, Matt, help me, please!
[267:22.23]I'm coming!
[267:22.95]I'm coming!
[267:24.85]Em, this is pretty unsteady over here.
[267:27.15]Matt, you've gotta do something right now!
[267:30.23]What are you waiting for?
[267:31.79]I'm thinking!
[267:32.97]Let me think!
[267:33.39]Oh, come on.
[267:34.07]Don't think, you idiot!
[267:35.29]You idiot!
[267:35.83]Just get me out of here!
[267:36.69]Stupid!
[267:40.46]I saw you with Mike!
[267:42.46]What a bad time for this, by the way.
[267:44.19]What a bad time.
[267:53.71]Look at my face.
[267:54.65]I'm just like, yeah, I got her on the ropes.
[267:57.19]Stupid!
[267:59.55]The man in the tunnel... Oh, shit.
[268:01.41]That was...
[268:11.76]You know, you and Mike are done after this.
[268:13.56]After I save your life.
[268:14.48]You and Mike are done.
[268:15.92]You get it?
[268:16.60]Yeah.
[268:16.70]Yeah, I get it.
[268:18.02]Oh, shit.
[268:18.36]I'm like a psycho.
[268:19.72]Now, will you please get me off this goddamn tower?
[268:22.74]Please, please, please, Matt.
[268:24.08]Just do something.
[268:24.78]Okay, this guy.
[268:25.85]I had respect for this guy.
[268:27.79]Until right... Get a jump.
[268:33.55]Oh.
[268:34.07]Ah!
[268:37.61]You idiot!
[268:38.21]We're going, we gotta go.
[268:40.03]We have to go, right?
[268:41.01]Sorry.
[268:41.27]She's gone.
[269:13.80]Wait, did I get to the end of the game?
[269:18.71]You and Mike are done.
[269:21.73]Her and Mike are done, apparently.
[269:29.89]Oh, God.
[269:34.80]What the fuck?
[269:35.62]Oh, that's what happens when you stop moving.
[269:45.72]That conversation was so pointless.
[269:54.61]I was like grilling her on like relationship shit.
[269:58.11]I'm like, that's over.
[269:59.21]You stop doing that.
[270:00.31]By the way, I'm just going to jump to safety and you're going to die.
[270:03.87]Like that whole conversation didn't need to happen at all.
[270:07.59]What the fuck is this photo?
[270:13.67]Chris.
[270:14.53]What?
[270:15.01]Chris, I just want to say, what happened back there in the shed, I know how hard that was.
[270:19.75]Josh was your friend.
[270:21.05]Ashley, stop.
[270:21.95]No, I want to say, I mean, thank you.
[270:24.26]Oh, man.
[270:24.72]Thank you for saving my life.
[270:27.02]You made her life hell, and then killed her.
[270:30.66]Well, hey, to be fair, to be fair, I was being, she was calling me names and shit.
[270:35.94]She was calling me stupid and idiot, like I'm worthless and shit.
[270:38.89]It's like, come on.
[270:39.43]I know.
[270:40.23]You and Josh were close.
[270:42.17]Look at this.
[270:44.13]What do you mean, look at this?
[270:45.75]Chris, what happened here?
[270:46.35]Oh, that's the vase I threw at the clown syringe guy.
[270:48.95]I'm no forensics expert, but it looks like it was thrown.
[270:53.72]How would you know that?
[270:54.76]You don't know that.
[270:58.46]Look, Emily could have been the killer, too.
[271:00.52]That's very possible.
[271:08.54]She made fun of me, and, and, and... Stupid!
[271:19.36]No.
[271:21.86]I'm at this... This guy, Chris, I think is the next one to go.
[271:30.23]Pretty good animation there.
[271:31.39]I liked it.
[271:35.51]So effed up.
[271:36.63]What is with these fucking magic doors?
[271:39.29]Somebody have like a controller that could make them close?
[271:43.71]That's... That's really creepy.
[271:52.05]Yeah, somebody's pushing buttons on these automatic doors in this fucking funhouse.
[271:59.15]Wait a minute.
[271:59.47]That was a girl in a towel.
[272:00.51]Did you just see that?
[272:01.39]Did I see what?
[272:04.35]That, Chris, that!
[272:05.95]What that was that?
[272:07.22]It was like a see-through shape, like a ghost.
[272:10.28]Oh, boy.
[272:11.36]I'm serious.
[272:13.28]Why don't you believe me?
[272:14.58]I said I saw it.
[272:15.74]Doesn't that count for anything?
[272:17.10]We've been through it.
[272:19.11]Hell tonight, okay?
[272:20.91]Your mind is fried.
[272:21.43]How scared of birds can you get?
[272:22.71]My mind is fried.
[272:24.25]I don't even trust what I've been seeing.
[272:27.47]You're just taking a lot of drugs.
[272:28.65]Concede.
[272:29.79]I saw a ghost.
[272:31.85]No, you didn't see a fucking ghost.
[272:34.29]I don't know.
[272:34.75]I don't know.
[272:35.75]I just... I saw something.
[272:37.57]Please.
[272:37.99]There's a person in a towel.
[272:39.43]Ash, it's okay.
[272:40.79]You're just... We're both kind of out of our heads right now.
[272:45.25]I mean, we just... We gotta pull it together, okay?
[272:47.43]You with me?
[272:48.75]This game is so inherently satisfying.
[272:50.89]Let's just keep our heads.
[272:52.83]Are we going crazy down here?
[272:55.67]It's the only place left Sam could be, Ash.
[272:57.99]I don't like this guy.
[272:58.71]I wish we could just go find everyone else.
[273:00.62]What if Sam needs us?
[273:01.60]That door is framed very suspiciously.
[273:03.50]Oh, God.
[273:06.56]Told you.
[273:08.28]Let's go.
[273:12.52]Come on.
[273:12.76]They had that door framed in like the watch out.
[273:14.96]The monster is coming in that door.
[273:27.65]Still need a Mario reference.
[273:28.94]What?
[273:31.68]There hasn't really been an opportunity for a Mario reference.
[273:35.53]Sorry to say.
[273:39.27]More spooky slamming doors.
[273:45.50]No, but really, what is going on?
[273:47.15]What is even going on?
[273:48.23]Is there a supernatural element to this game or is this like who the killer is?
[273:51.53]I don't know.
[274:06.91]What was that?
[274:07.45]Fucking locked door.
[274:08.12]This is not one of those automatic doors that opens.
[274:09.50]Chris.
[274:31.16]No.
[274:31.46]Not that way.
[274:32.14]Mmm.
[274:32.42]Automatic door.
[274:33.12]Swing open.
[274:33.44]Whatever is it.
[274:33.92]Some kind of animal was back here.
[274:35.78]Somebody bit through the door.
[274:36.80]I don't know.
[274:37.30]Oh, no.
[274:37.48]That's when she dropped the... Oh, where's the handle?
[275:00.24]Didn't she have the handle down here?
[275:01.94]Wasn't she, like, trying to grab it?
[275:03.72]Before I got syringed?
[275:05.10]Where did it go?
[275:12.37]Wait!
[275:12.77]Chris!
[275:12.99]Chris!
[275:13.17]Chris!
[275:13.53]Chris!
[275:13.73]The ghost!
[275:14.47]What?
[275:14.87]Didn't you see it?
[275:16.07]That was like Hannah walking there.
[275:18.06]You were looking at your phone, you dip!
[275:19.86]What are you tweeting?
[275:20.60]So, they're alive.
[275:21.96]ghost after us?
[275:22.98]Ash, calm down.
[275:24.38]Okay?
[275:25.16]There is no ghost here.
[275:27.16]Ghost of what?
[275:28.74]You're freaked out because of what happened with Josh.
[275:31.13]You're not paying attention.
[275:32.17]I saw it.
[275:32.81]I saw a ghost and it looked like Hannah.
[275:34.43]It looked like Hannah.
[275:35.43]Wait, wait, wait.
[275:36.01]What?
[275:36.27]Or maybe Pat.
[275:37.45]Jesus, Ash.
[275:38.77]What do you think?
[275:39.37]They followed us up here from the seance?
[275:40.81]I don't know.
[275:41.53]Maybe.
[275:41.87]They didn't because ghosts don't exist.
[275:45.63]Okay?
[275:46.45]He was talking to us at the seance, Chris.
[275:50.32]I don't know.
[275:51.94]He's gonna come clean here.
[275:52.84]More vandalism.
[275:58.86]What did that?
[276:00.10]How does a picture just jump off the wall like that?
[276:02.99]He sounds way too... He's fucking in on it.
[276:07.21]He just is.
[276:07.65]Give me that fucking key.
[276:16.03]Here you go.
[276:19.09]Oh my god!
[276:21.14]Look there, Chris, you can't tell me you didn't see that.
[276:24.26]He did see it.
[276:26.00]See?
[276:26.58]You do see it.
[276:27.42]I don't know, I just, this is fucking crazy.
[276:31.42]Chris, it's showing us the way.
[276:33.52]It's showing us the way.
[276:41.58]Wow, man, whoa, whoa, ghost.
[276:45.54]A real ghost.
[276:46.22]Hey, like, can I ask you a question?
[276:48.46]You ever been syringed before?
[276:53.15]You think it like feels weird?
[276:54.69]I don't know.
[276:55.19]Video camera.
[276:55.93]And turn it up.
[276:56.61]There's the key.
[276:57.85]Nice fingernail look there.
[276:58.59]That's very nice fingernail graphics.

[278:06.00]That can't happen in real life.
[278:09.76]Oh, 2142.
[278:11.14]2013-1442.
[278:13.14]I found Shibby's diary.
[278:15.82]Yep.
[278:17.46]We finally can find out Shibby's secrets.
[278:21.01]Mom finally agreed.
[278:22.71]The invitations are out.
[278:23.63]The party is going to happen.
[278:24.77]I hate that I have to wait.
[278:26.47]So far, Ash, Matt, Sam have said definitely yes.
[278:29.91]Nothing from Mike.
[278:31.75]Hmm.
[278:32.92]Chibi, where are you going?
[278:34.64]Oh my god, Mike confirmed!
[278:36.16]He phoned Josh this afternoon!
[278:37.92]And he does one of those little doodles!
[278:42.07]Woohoo, it's party time tomorrow!
[278:43.53]Everyone being here together.
[278:44.49]I was gonna read it, but go ahead.
[278:45.89]Okay.
[279:02.60]All right.
[279:04.84]What was that?
[279:06.98]Here comes the ghost.
[279:09.22]Ghost of Christmas Past.
[279:10.22]This is only for PS4.
[279:13.38]This game was a PS4 exclusive.
[279:14.95]It is not on any other platform, unfortunately.
[279:26.35]More walking around.
[279:28.21]Right.
[279:30.16]Right.
[279:44.80]Do you think Sam- wait, Sam's the syringe clown?
[279:57.26]Spiders!
[280:02.10]No, those are cockroaches.
[280:03.04]What the fuck?
[280:03.52]Where's the spiders?
[280:04.66]I didn't select that as my doom.
[280:06.48]What was that?
[280:13.44]There's a whole nother room through here.
[280:15.50]Where does he go?
[280:17.58]Chris, I don't know if I want to keep going.
[280:19.84]We're doing it anyways.
[280:27.60]Where in the world are we now?
[280:29.93]This is where Syringe Clown was.
[280:32.33]Last sighting of Syringe Clown was down this hall.
[280:34.75]This is like a whole nother hotel.
[280:36.45]I had no idea this was here.
[280:40.21]For somebody that has no idea...
[280:42.58]Well, let me... Hold on a second.
[280:44.16]Let me go look over here for a minute.
[280:45.48]Like, how would he know all this shit was here?
[280:49.80]Alright, well, whatever.
[280:56.57]I can't do anything over there anyways.
[280:58.03]Let's just keep going.
[281:03.81]I don't think I can take any more of this.
[281:05.95]Yeah, I'm about at my limit here too.
[281:08.77]All I wanted to do was forget last year ever happened.
[281:12.38]To be honest, I'm not sure what Hannah thought she was doing.
[281:15.96]Yeah, well, you know how it is when you're crushing pretty hard on people.
[281:20.38]Great, so you're basically saying that we put a vulnerable friend in a terrible situation and essentially caused her to run away and never to be heard from again.
[281:31.36]We made her look stupid.
[281:33.38]If it was you, don't you think you would have run away?
[281:36.62]I mean, who likes being made fun of?
[281:41.13]People don't make fun of me.
[281:42.67]To your face.
[281:44.85]What?
[281:45.87]Chris, we made her look so stupid in front of all of her friends and the guy she liked.
[281:50.97]I can't imagine doing anything worse to somebody.
[282:05.17]Screen of death incoming.
[282:06.99]Oh no, my dog.
[282:11.03]Oh.
[282:11.59]Hey, what's that?
[282:19.78]Curly's out.
[282:20.22]No, I'm like sweating and my hair looks like shit.
[282:22.29]Like, there you go.
[282:24.56]Invoice enclosed.
[282:25.44]Who is it for?
[282:25.94]Here's the smoking gun.
[282:29.45]Oh shit, that's my address.
[282:32.67]Imagine if that was my, like, real address.
[282:39.37]And I was the ultimate prank.
[282:44.86]Okay.
[282:46.16]Fake newspapers.
[282:48.12]Alright.
[282:52.00]You can move.
[282:53.29]Please.
[282:56.82]You know what?
[282:57.84]No.
[282:58.52]Ash?
[282:58.92]No, I've had enough.
[283:00.18]I'm not going down any further into this nightmare, Chris.
[283:03.30]Ashley, I understand, okay?
[283:06.10]I'm really freaked out too, but if Sam's down there all alone with a maniac and we leave, we're basically killing her ourselves.
[283:13.07]I fucked it up.
[283:14.29]It was like scratching my fucking... Look at this hair.
[283:18.31]God.
[283:20.95]I fucked it up.
[283:21.51]I was trying to do it again, but I was scratching my head and rubbing my belly at the same time.
[283:29.06]Purple curtains.
[283:30.56]Yeah, Twitch TV, man.
[283:31.92]My hair is, like, super dry, and I gotta, like, get some better conditioning, man.
[283:36.53]Like, I...
[284:00.15]Why am I telling you guys this?
[284:01.47]Like, who cares?
[284:04.61]Why am I telling you guys about, like, how I need conditioner?
[284:07.25]Chris, I'm getting a really weird feeling from all this.
[284:11.33]What do you mean?
[284:11.93]Well, I just, I can't shake the feeling that those fake newspapers have something to do with the guy who killed Josh.
[284:17.48]Wait, like what?
[284:18.54]Like it's a setup or something?
[284:19.84]Yeah, but I mean, how?
[284:20.94]It's just, it almost makes sense, but it just feels like we're missing something.
[284:24.36]This guy Chris killed Josh.
[284:26.56]She was in the room.
[284:31.57]Here comes the big reveal.
[284:32.56]It's him.
[284:33.18]It's just going to happen.
[284:39.70]What is that?
[284:40.14]TV lights.
[284:44.71]Batteries and timers.
[284:47.27]Okay.
[284:52.95]Is there something up there?
[284:55.21]No.
[285:00.59]This is weird like torture device.
[285:08.30]We're gonna get to the smoking gun real soon here.
[285:12.42]Here it comes.
[285:18.97]It was me.
[285:20.21]I'm the killer.
[285:20.85]It was me the whole time.
[285:24.03]Count Dr. Acula.
[285:29.18]He's like walking away from me.
[285:30.72]Stop walking away.
[285:31.76]Now he's silent walking away from me.
[285:33.20]I don't trust this guy.
[285:36.22]I really don't.
[285:38.20]Oh, crap.
[285:39.46]Look at that.
[285:41.84]What?
[285:42.36]Might be Sam's.
[285:44.34]Alright, let me see if I can get this...
[285:48.52]He's lying.
[285:49.00]He's a liar.
[285:49.58]Liar.
[285:49.86]This guy's a liar.
[285:51.54]Don't let this guy follow, Chris.
[285:52.82]Don't let this guy out of my sight.
[285:55.61]Like, seriously.
[285:56.23]It's a wrench clone.
[285:56.79]Found him.
[286:19.11]Hey, weapon.
[286:22.23]Weapon.
[286:24.11]Can't paint.
[286:24.55]Weapon.
[286:24.99]I need a weapon.
[286:25.55]Weapon.
[286:26.27]What's this?
[286:27.69]Weapon.
[286:28.77]Goddammit.
[286:29.31]There's nothing I can use as a weapon here.
[286:31.59]Not like an ice pick.
[286:32.59]Oh.
[286:44.39]Wait, are they not even concerned about that this is Sam?
[286:48.58]They don't seem like they don't give a fuck at all.
[286:51.40]What?
[286:51.56]Your friend is hanging on a meat hook in front of you.
[286:56.10]What?
[287:15.58]I'm confused.
[287:22.24]That's not Sam.
[287:23.22]No, that's not her claw.
[287:23.96]That's not a dummy.
[287:30.36]That's not what happened.
[287:36.64]Wait a minute.
[287:39.01]Is she alive?
[287:39.67]She's going to turn around.
[287:41.91]She's going to have a fucking clown face.
[287:43.19]Clown makeup on.
[287:44.67]Watch.
[287:47.61]Here we go.
[287:49.67]We're gonna turn it around, and it's gonna fucking... It's gonna be a scary moment.
[287:54.89]Here we go.
[288:03.59]Why is it... Okay, I'm getting ready.
[288:09.55]Oh!
[288:10.41]Oh, no, it's... She's dead.
[288:12.61]Holy shit, holy shit.
[288:13.71]She's not.
[288:14.25]She's not.
[288:14.77]She's not dead.
[288:16.02]How do you know?
[288:16.70]She's still breathing.
[288:19.08]The hell is wrong?
[288:20.71]I was getting ready for it.
[288:23.65]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[288:24.67]This is bad.
[288:25.55]This is bad.
[288:26.05]We've got to get her out of here.
[288:27.65]No, no, no.
[288:28.85]Syringe.
[288:29.33]Oh, shit.
[288:29.89]It's a syringe club.
[288:32.53]Okay.
[288:33.30]What do I do?
[288:35.28]What do I do?
[288:38.16]What do I do?
[288:51.37]Who the fuck is this clown?
[288:53.64]Honestly.
[288:56.66]Oh no, not one of these.
[288:57.88]I want to do something.
[289:00.70]In front of you is a chessboard.
[289:03.34]The first one to get checkmate.
[289:05.34]The other person gets a shotgun up their ass.
[289:09.28]Congratulations.
[289:11.24]It begins now.
[289:14.19]You can only have checkmate with the bishop.
[289:16.99]The game might take three weeks.
[289:19.93]Good luck.
[289:22.01]You monster!
[289:22.71]Look around.
[289:23.25]We're gonna die, Chris.
[289:24.47]I don't think I'm ready to die.
[289:27.63]No one is going to die.
[289:29.55]I wish I could tell you.
[289:30.83]It's just not fair.
[289:32.67]I want you to review my game.
[289:34.73]What?
[289:35.63]Tell me what.
[289:36.15]It's too late.
[289:38.43]Chris, what's the point?
[289:39.83]She has information?
[289:41.49]We're always talking around it.
[289:43.55]And now, I mean, we've wasted everything.
[289:47.15]Ashley, none of it was wasted.
[289:50.63]What do you mean?
[289:51.25]What?
[289:51.35]What are you saying, Chris?
[289:52.23]That's such a crush on you.
[289:53.17]Chris.
[289:53.87]It's awful.
[290:09.94]Okay.
[290:10.40]Ashley, I'll get you out of this.
[290:12.10]I won't let you die.
[290:14.78]All right.
[290:15.08]Hello there, my special little subjects.
[290:17.71]Don't be scared, Chris.
[290:20.11]Don't be scared.
[290:21.53]Oh, you should be, Ash, because here's the question.
[290:23.97]Why is it always this guy that has to do it?
[290:25.55]Chris has made one fatal choice already today, and now he must make another.
[290:30.81]It always has to be Chris.
[290:32.03]Chris, you can take that gun in front of you and shoot Ashley.
[290:38.01]Oh, my God.
[290:38.79]Whoever's left can live.
[290:41.18]The choice is yours.
[290:43.12]Oh, God.
[290:47.46]Don't be so silly, Chris.
[290:48.92]Chris, oh, my Lord.
[290:51.28]I don't like... Wait, stop.
[290:56.68]Wait, I didn't want to make the decision.
[290:58.32]I didn't want to make the decision.
[290:59.22]I wanted to think it over.
[291:00.84]You chose to save me before.
[291:02.05]Let me choose this time.
[291:03.81]Let me choose to save you.
[291:06.50]I just wanted to look over here.
[291:07.72]If I do one last thing in my life, let me do this!
[291:10.32]He didn't even give a second thought.
[291:11.96]Chris, please!
[291:13.26]I'm gonna do it.
[291:15.67]Oh, God.
[291:17.49]You or me.
[291:19.33]You or me.
[291:19.89]I don't have much time here.
[291:23.03]Oh, God.
[291:31.22]I got it!
[291:41.66]You have gone too far now.
[291:44.43]Don't you see?
[291:46.59]Don't you see that this torch of porn has gone too far?
[291:53.53]Now what gives you the right to play God in these people's lives?
[291:58.60]What makes you so special then?
[292:02.70]What the fuck is happening?
[292:10.08]You're sick.
[292:11.72]You're a sick fuck!
[292:15.81]Now what the hell have you done to them?
[292:18.15]Huh?
[292:20.53]What the hell have you done to them?
[292:23.29]Psychopath!
[292:27.43]Psychopath!
[292:29.99]So wait, he was the other clown?
[292:34.13]So like, this was like a therapy session, and they were dressing up as clowns.
[292:39.43]Wow, this is weird.
[292:47.30]It's quite a cliffhanger.
[292:48.82]We got two clowns.
[292:49.68]Hello?
[292:51.92]Sam?
[292:55.26]Oh, God!
[292:56.24]Chris, the choice is yours.
[292:59.37]Hello?
[293:02.41]Oh, my God!
[293:05.03]Help, please!
[293:08.51]What the fuck?
[293:09.29]We lost... Who did we lose?
[293:10.67]We lost Chris.
[293:11.37]We lost Emily.
[293:15.37]Did we lose Mike?
[293:16.27]Did my foolishness kill him?
[293:18.19]I don't even know.
[293:20.75]No, that's a very, very safe, I-didn't-die-in-the-movie-yet scene.
[293:24.63]Where you think that it could be.
[293:27.22]Violence.
[293:29.60]Four hours till dawn.
[293:33.10]Sam is still alive.
[293:33.98]Wait, no, there's Mike.
[293:34.68]Okay.
[293:35.22]He just kind of has a burnt face.
[293:36.40]He has, like, burnt hair.
[293:44.04]She's tied to the chair, dude.
[293:45.04]I can't even get over here.
[293:49.96]One more.
[293:50.54]One more.
[293:59.77]What time is it?
[294:02.43]Midnight.
[294:07.59]Alright, one more.
[294:08.85]Last one.
[294:09.89]We'll do one more chapter and then we'll finish it off.
[294:14.01]If you do one more, your Tuesday stream is going to be like an hour.
[294:17.25]I'll get another PS4 game to play.
[294:20.43]I am interested.
[294:22.25]We're all fucking here now.
[294:25.63]We'll do one more.
[294:27.27]We'll finish this up on Tuesday.
[294:29.49]And then we'll play something else on PS4.
[294:32.09]Maybe we'll fucking play Yakuza.
[294:34.23]That's a possibility.
[294:35.97]It's there.
[294:38.27]So we're going to stick with the PS4.
[294:39.91]We'll do one more.
[294:42.00]And let's go.
[294:45.50]Okay.
[294:46.83]I'm safe now.
[294:49.79]We're good.
[294:51.59]How did you get down there?
[294:59.21]How did you get down here?
[295:03.35]I mean, I know, but the actress doesn't.
[295:05.20]Get here.
[295:05.76]How'd you find me?
[295:06.82]There's some fucking maniac up here on the mountain.
[295:08.94]Yeah, I've noticed.
[295:10.72]He lives in this, like, web of tunnels.
[295:13.36]I was down there trying to get out, and then I found this crate, and I saw him.
[295:19.59]You're torn between watching and spoiling for myself.
[295:22.93]Well, Talix apparently did multiple playthroughs.
[295:24.53]There's many different things that can happen, I guess.
[295:27.39]I guess.
[295:28.17]The Maniac.
[295:43.42]Hey, thank you, Eucalyptine, for the $5.
[295:45.87]Jerma, it's my birthday today.
[295:47.05]Cake and ice cream is on its way, I hope.
[295:48.79]I hope so, too.
[295:50.53]Hopefully you have a fucking fantastic birthday.
[295:53.65]Eucalyptine, thanks for the $5.
[295:56.09]The Tiny Silveon, thanks for the $2.
[295:58.14]Jerma, was that a face reveal?
[296:01.90]Yeah, I revealed my face.
[296:04.90]Again, the Tiny Silveon, a $5 total.
[296:07.84]Jerma, you're the best stream, and I love watching your streams a lot.
[296:10.67]Well, thank you.
[296:12.61]Thank you so much.
[296:15.92]Uh, who's back?
[296:16.46]Is that my back?
[296:17.96]No, that's Alf's backpack.
[296:18.99]Was there anything else I needed in that room?
[296:36.42]I don't know.
[296:36.74]You've been such a good boy this year.
[296:42.39]You deserve treats.
[296:45.41]I don't think this girl weighs enough to open this door, by the way.
[296:48.13]What about this one?
[296:51.19]This looks like more your speed.
[296:55.07]It is.
[296:59.38]Open up your gifts.
[297:03.80]He's wearing that fucking coat too, though.
[297:07.90]I would take that thing off.
[297:09.02]Nice to see you too.
[297:17.16]Oh, we might.
[297:19.00]Be careful here.
[297:19.44]What if I get a choice?
[297:20.06]Turn around or look?
[297:20.58]Okay.
[297:20.68]Oh, Alph, is your head closed?
[297:21.90]Oh, wait a minute.
[297:22.44]So we're like changing costumes.
[297:48.22]Is that what she was wearing before?
[297:51.81]I don't know.
[297:56.31]So this is happening, like, moments before.
[298:01.95]So they pop in.
[298:03.45]All right.
[298:06.75]Wait, what?
[298:08.95]No!
[298:09.69]No, no, no!
[298:10.47]Get away!
[298:11.53]What the?
[298:11.89]What's this?
[298:15.10]Oh, Chris.
[298:15.80]This didn't happen.
[298:17.70]Oh, Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris.
[298:19.62]What the fuck?
[298:20.75]Oh, they were blanks.
[298:21.29]You've heard of blanks before.
[298:23.33]Oh, I get it.
[298:24.11]I mean, really?
[298:26.47]Oh, the reveal.
[298:29.37]What?
[298:29.75]What?
[298:31.87]What?
[298:34.01]What, is this guy like a special effects artist?
[298:38.47]Oh, God!
[298:39.79]Oh, my God, Matt!
[298:41.69]So, hold on, this guy has, like, fucking, this guy has, like, a Jim Henson fucking creature shock?
[298:46.49]Shit!
[298:47.35]The ultimate prank?
[298:48.31]Oh, shit!
[298:53.02]Dammit!
[298:53.52]Is this girl still alive?
[298:55.92]Is anybody even dead?
[298:57.90]Have we lost anybody?
[298:58.86]I don't think anybody has actually died yet.
[299:17.00]Oh, fuck, come on.
[299:19.00]I was too... I was too busy, like, laughing at this.
[299:30.16]I don't think I can... I think I have to do this quick to everything.
[299:36.02]I have to do it.
[299:36.72]Okay, let's just do it.
[299:37.70]Get it over with.
[299:38.24]Let's go.
[299:45.02]I thought for a second I did too long, and I fucking fell.
[299:58.15]I can't wait for Josh to tell me about how much trouble it was to fake his own death.
[300:24.42]Like, I'm telling you, this is gonna be one of those scenarios where... Well, maybe if it was real, then... Are they, like, clones?
[300:53.74]Is Josh, like, part of, like, a clone experiment?
[300:55.56]Is Josh, like, the minor clones?
[301:01.50]I'm one of 14 Joshes.
[301:05.21]You saw Josh five and a half.
[301:07.21]There's six more of us.
[301:16.22]Scary noise, sure.
[301:19.14]I'm shocked that Emily is even still alive.
[301:24.26]Oh, first aid.
[301:24.88]Go that way.
[301:28.28]All the miners are Josh.
[301:29.86]Different, like, facial hair and shit.
[301:33.65]Uh... Eucalyptine, thanks for the five dollars.
[301:36.89]Jeremiah, it's my birthday.
[301:37.81]Wait, didn't you just... Why is that popping up twice for me?
[301:41.75]Because then somebody else came in.
[301:43.01]Dubsky dude.
[301:43.73]Because we got the eucalyptus on his birthday.
[301:46.46]I don't know why this popped up twice.
[301:47.64]It just popped up again.
[301:49.50]But Dubsky dude, thanks for the three dollars.
[301:51.26]I told Italics it sounded like he was adopting some of your mannerisms, so to be fair, I'll say you're adopting some of his.
[301:58.12]Am I right or am I right?
[302:00.38]Usually that's what happens when you hang out with somebody.
[302:02.01]You talk to them for an extended period of time.
[302:05.71]You
[302:07.48]gain some of their way that they talk, I would assume.
[302:11.86]It just happens.
[302:13.58]Why?
[302:13.94]Everyone's saying sub only.
[302:16.40]Why?
[302:16.74]Why?
[302:16.98]Why?
[302:17.30]Are we freaking out?
[302:17.98]Are we doing... Are we doing spoilers in the chat again?
[302:21.14]Are we gonna have to... Am I gonna have to... Are we gonna have to turn on the fucking prison?
[302:28.75]I'm just gonna burn this off with the, uh... Well, that's not a rope.
[302:31.83]Okay.
[302:32.41]I thought... Okay, there could've been, like, better chocolate.
[302:34.61]I don't fucking know.
[302:42.16]There are no spoilers, everyone's freaking... Why are people that... Why are non-subs saying, yes, put it in sub mode?
[302:48.37]Don't you want to be able to speak your mind?
[303:05.34]But Jerma, how will you know how to play this video game without my guidance?
[303:12.59]Turn this on.
[303:15.64]But he's right.
[303:16.54]How am I going to be able to know what to do without his guidance?
[303:27.92]Whoa, scariness.
[303:30.94]In and out burger, 36.
[303:34.21]Clock out machine.
[303:35.97]I could have done better than that.
[303:37.79]If I sat there for another three seconds, you would have gotten way better material.
[303:41.11]Apologize.
[303:45.04]Fucking In-N-Out Burger sucks, so who cares?
[303:49.78]Uh-oh, did you hear what this guy said?
[303:51.26]He said In-N-Out Burger's not good.
[303:52.95]Good thing it's on sub-only mode.
[303:56.41]You know what I heard about In-N-Out Burger?
[304:00.77]Is that... Oh yeah, well In-N-Out Burger sucks.
[304:04.33]I eat there all the time, but you gotta order from the secret menu.
[304:07.27]What do you mean secret menu?
[304:10.42]Give me the fucking real menu.
[304:13.02]If something is good at a restaurant, and it has to be secretly fucking ordered, no, give me the good shit on the menu so I don't make the mistake of just ordering a regular cheeseburger from your fucking two-item menu.
[304:24.55]You know what I'm saying?
[304:30.09]Don't tell me it's a secret.
[304:31.97]Give it to me.
[304:34.09]Did I pull this already?
[304:48.13]Now that I'm done ranting.
[304:52.25]Chipotle is a real... Look, okay.
[304:54.85]I'm going to backtrack a second here.
[304:57.91]I went to In-N-Out Burger before.
[304:59.11]And it was good.
[305:01.13]It was like good.
[305:01.93]It was a good burger.
[305:04.07]It was flavorful.
[305:05.21]It was done in a very timely manner.
[305:08.73]The food came out quickly.
[305:12.23]but it was just kind of like a default cheeseburger.
[305:14.81]It wasn't like the greatest thing.
[305:16.19]People talk about In-N-Out Burger like they're talking about their new girlfriend or their like new wife.
[305:22.77]Oh my God.
[305:23.75]Let me tell you something, man.
[305:26.08]It was so hot.
[305:28.20]She's so hot.
[305:29.24]She's so juicy.
[305:31.22]I'd love to let you know.
[305:32.50]This is important.
[305:36.18]Like, it's the best thing that ever happened to me.
[305:38.74]Once I finally, like, put my mouth around it, it was, like, seriously delicious, and it was perfect.
[305:47.35]It's like I get it.
[305:50.83]320, you know where your fucking kids are?
[305:55.47]Oh, skulls!
[305:56.33]This is so fucking loud.
[305:58.74]Shut up.
[306:03.33]But you know what I mean, though?
[306:04.35]And then, like... You actually... Like, In-N-Out Burger is just like... It's just like a hamburger place.
[306:11.35]Where they make you, like, fast food hamburgers.
[306:15.87]It's good.
[306:17.50]But is it really as good as you're saying?
[306:19.36]Is it really as good as you're talking about?
[306:21.12]I don't know.
[306:29.00]One try.
[306:29.79]Damn.
[306:30.83]Damn.
[306:33.46]Gonna have to give Emily a little credit here.
[306:35.93]First try.
[306:38.01]She broke that down.
[306:38.95]Nobody else has been able to do that.
[306:43.27]Emily gets the award for actually being able to break a goddamn door down.
[306:48.85]How many would it take, like, Chris, like, eight tries to fucking bust a door down?
[306:53.43]Don't be a mimic.
[306:54.93]Don't be a fucking mimic chest.
[306:59.71]It's not.
[307:02.29]Hmm.
[307:04.00]Who is this?
[307:05.70]Here is Billy.
[307:08.55]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[307:09.73]Something, something, something.
[307:11.77]Okay.
[307:15.09]I'll write down the secret menu for you when we go to California again.
[307:18.35]Yeah, I need it in writing and I need to know what it is.
[307:23.26]Like, I'll tell you, okay, I'm gonna tell you a story.
[307:25.34]I may have told this story on stream before, maybe I haven't.
[307:28.02]So, like, the reason why I have such a problem with a secret menu is Starbucks has a secret menu.
[307:35.64]Shut up!
[307:37.15]You can, like, burn another day.
[307:38.43]I'm trying to fucking talk about my secret menu.
[307:41.95]So, Starbucks has a secret menu that has certain items on it, right?
[307:46.25]And, I don't know, maybe like a year or two ago, there was apparently, you could get like the Harry Potter drink.
[307:52.18]Like, whatever it was.
[307:53.02]It was like the butter beer, the mead, honey mead thing from Harry Potter was a secret menu item.
[307:59.18]I walked into the Starbucks.
[308:02.50]And I said, uh, hey, uh, I walked up really slyly, because, I mean, if you call something a fucking secret menu, then it's a secret, and, like, you're not supposed to know about it.
[308:10.25]So I walked up, and I was, like, looking both ways, like, crossing the street, and I'm like, excuse me, uh, ma'am, uh, I would, uh, you know what I'm gonna order is a secret menu here, uh, I'm gonna order a, uh, Harry Potter drink.
[308:23.09]And she's like, she's like, what are you talking about?
[308:26.52]And I was like, yeah, the Harry Potter butterbeer, the secret menu item.
[308:31.74]She's like, you want me to make you, like, a latte?
[308:33.54]What do you want in it?
[308:34.36]And I'm like, no, it's a secret, it was a secret menu, and I looked like a fucking idiot, because she had no idea what I was talking about.
[308:40.93]So, like, I don't order off secret menus, because apparently they're so secret, the fucking employees don't even know they exist.
[308:49.39]And then I look like a weirdo, because she was just trying to, she's like, what do you, do we have, like, you want me to make you, you want me to put, like, this and that, and she's like, do you know how to make it?
[308:58.68]I was like, I don't know how to make it.
[309:00.36]No, just give me a fucking iced coffee, and I left.
[309:02.70]Like, in anger, I left.
[309:10.21]So, I don't order off secret menus, and when I hear about a secret menu, I'm like, okay, fine, that's bullshit.
[309:16.39]I'm gonna go to order a secret menu item off of In-N-Out, and the guy's gonna be like, you want a hamburger?
[309:20.54]I don't know what that is.
[309:22.06]And then I'm gonna look like a dumbass.
[309:25.75]Yeah, she asked me if I know how to make it.
[309:29.21]Because apparently with the secret menu items at Starbucks, some of them, it's not even like a secret menu, they just will make it if you tell them how to make it.
[309:38.00]And it's like one pump of vanilla cream, two pumps of toffee nut, whipped up soy milk, and it's like, I don't fucking know.
[309:44.56]Son of a bitch.
[309:50.07]I'm about to kill this character, why?
[309:56.67]Indiana Jones ride again.
[309:57.87]Well, this might pick it up.
[310:11.19]Do you know how to make the item that's on our secret menu?
[310:13.19]Yeah, how would I know if it was a secret?
[310:15.41]How?
[310:15.81]I don't know the secret.
[310:16.93]I just know, like, through the grapevine that, like, it exists.
[310:20.59]So how am I going to tell you how to make a secret menu item when it's a secret?
[310:23.25]I don't know it.
[310:24.47]That's why I'm having you make the secret menu item.
[310:27.63]Because I don't know the secret.
[310:29.07]How am I supposed to know?
[310:36.26]Starbucks has a secret... There is like a banana... There's like a banana latte.
[310:40.78]Go type in Starbucks secret menu.
[310:42.10]It's there.
[310:47.94]Why did I come over here?
[310:49.63]Oh.
[310:55.81]I don't know.
[310:56.33]I'm of the opinion that like... Why have a secret menu?
[311:01.13]Do this instead.
[311:02.31]Have a fucking menu, and then have a menu to the right of it that says, like, cool shit.
[311:07.57]Or like, hey, check this shit out.
[311:09.33]And it's like a list of the secret things that they would make anyway.
[311:13.32]So then all the people, they can know that it's an option for them, you know?
[311:17.20]Let's see how this person's gonna die.
[311:25.34]Some long-armed person.
[311:31.41]There's a spooky arm that comes out, alright?
[311:33.55]So be careful.
[311:44.93]That's true, though.
[311:45.63]I don't understand secret menus.
[311:47.63]I kind of... I think I get it.
[311:50.90]Where it's like, they can make it, but they don't want to put it on the menu because they don't want to have to be making it all the time.
[311:57.83]And you don't want something just weird like, oh, no, banana pineapple hamburger on your menu because people are going to be like, that's gross.
[312:04.29]I don't want a fucking, I don't want like a Spongebob burger.
[312:06.79]Like, that's what you'd call it on that menu.
[312:08.24]And it's like, I don't want that.
[312:09.56]This place is gross.
[312:10.74]And they would leave.
[312:11.56]They want the standard default fucking hamburger.
[312:14.54]I made it out.
[312:15.00]This character is going to be alive.
[312:18.02]I made it out of here.
[312:20.58]I don't know why you attempted to climb that, but she'll get up.
[312:26.22]Starbucks syringe full of double shot espresso served by a barista in a clown mask.
[312:37.12]Are animal fries on the secret menu?
[312:38.54]Animal fries are not listed on the menu.
[312:40.17]You know what I'm saying?
[312:44.17]When are you getting yours, Beth?
[312:45.67]They have double tattoos.
[312:46.93]Sure.
[312:54.85]Over here.
[312:59.67]Double shot of espresso with my syringe.
[313:03.63]Why can I not look at this?
[313:07.16]What the fuck's an animal fry?
[313:09.08]I know.
[313:10.46]I know.
[313:11.30]Emperor snacks.
[313:13.34]I know.
[313:14.36]I didn't know when I went to In-N-Out.
[313:16.20]It wasn't listed on the fucking menu.
[313:20.82]So I don't know either.
[313:21.96]But apparently they're fucking awesome.
[313:24.10]Cool.
[313:25.32]Put them on the menu.
[313:26.76]And then hire the fucking Muppets to do like a tie-in.
[313:28.76]And have Animal be like, FRIES!
[313:30.50]FRIES!
[313:31.22]And like smash on the fucking drums.
[313:33.06]And you'll make a million dollars.
[313:36.28]I just solved In-N-Out's marketing crisis that they're in right now.
[313:39.44]They're in a crisis, by the way.
[313:40.73]Failing.
[313:48.35]What does that mean?
[313:52.58]I don't know.
[313:59.92]It's just Barney from The Sims.
[314:01.88]Low energy in and out.
[314:06.07]Can I just be honest?
[314:06.73]I'm getting kind of sick of walking around in the fucking dark as this girl.
[314:16.09]I'm kind of getting sick of walking around down here in the dark.
[314:20.85]That's why I went off on like a 20 minute animal fries rant.
[314:29.52]What's on the wood?
[314:30.88]Bitch!
[314:31.86]Oh no, Beth!
[314:33.28]Okay, Beth.
[314:39.37]I thought that's... Alright, it says Beth.
[314:42.19]Oh no.
[314:53.74]And here we are.
[314:57.84]That was one of the premonitions, right?
[315:05.59]You solved the mystery.
[315:06.59]You're not going to notice spoilers, but on record.
[315:09.81]What is this?
[315:12.28]It's a locket.
[315:13.46]And it says nothing.
[315:14.50]Should I keep it?
[315:15.58]What is it?
[315:17.54]Why is that such a point of interest?
[315:22.94]Um...
[315:24.22]Okay.
[315:28.28]Arm can't reach through?
[315:29.30]I guess not.
[315:30.74]I don't know.
[315:31.82]I guess it can.
[315:32.50]Why wouldn't it let me do this before?
[315:33.82]And I'm sorry for the loud air conditioner.
[315:38.68]It's going to come into focus, whatever it is.
[315:49.12]Totem?
[315:50.30]Oh, shit.
[315:50.76]Hold on here, because we're going to turn it around.
[315:54.72]Getting ready to spin it around.
[315:56.89]Oh, fuck, I didn't... I thought I was gonna have to turn.
[316:00.99]Oh, that's Beth.
[316:03.35]Oh, God!
[316:04.95]Oh, God!
[316:05.65]Beth, no!
[316:06.97]Oh, God, Beth, no!
[316:08.17]Yeah, well, so we've confirmed that Beth is dead.
[316:12.67]She fell down during, like, the mining exit.
[316:18.51]I spun it a little too hard.
[316:22.15]Yeah, she would have been okay if I had just been more careful.
[316:27.33]Nice jacket.
[316:29.69]Alright, Emily's arc has to come to a close here.
[316:37.51]This is getting a little tiresome, Emily.
[316:41.36]I kind of want to move on to a new character.
[316:49.90]And out 36.
[316:52.71]All employees in the clock out.
[316:54.07]Yeah, I...
[316:56.65]Not what?
[316:57.11]Not what?
[316:57.63]Does the elevator work?
[317:06.02]I guess.
[317:07.32]Let's go.
[317:11.42]Try it again.
[317:13.30]Give it a good grip.
[317:14.24]Pull it down.
[317:16.16]That way.
[317:19.72]Good.
[317:25.03]Horror game elevators.
[317:28.20]Alright, well, there's another one.
[317:30.44]There's Mr. Flamethrower.
[317:31.56]Wait, what do you mean, don't move?
[317:35.44]What?
[317:36.88]Oh, fuck.
[317:37.48]Okay, don't, like, shit.
[317:39.58]Don't move.
[317:40.62]What the fuck?
[317:41.88]I didn't even have a chance.
[317:42.94]This is the doctor.
[317:49.99]That's the doctor.
[317:50.87]Look it.
[317:51.39]You can, like, tell from his, like, face.
[317:56.19]Either that or he's a miner.
[317:59.37]Fuck.
[318:00.11]I hit the wrong button.
[318:07.49]Yeah, we can light this up here.
[318:16.95]I don't think that did anything.
[318:18.86]You can very easily step through this.
[318:24.90]Stab him with the fire.
[318:30.37]There he is.
[318:31.39]Should I not move?
[318:33.65]Hi.
[318:35.87]Okay.
[318:37.27]All right, let's see what happens.
[318:52.47]Oh, oh, very good.
[318:54.86]Everyone of you, you got my name.
[318:56.68]And after all you've been through, good.
[318:59.58]Good, good, good, good, good.
[319:00.62]I mean, how does that feel?
[319:02.26]Right?
[319:03.04]How does it feel?
[319:03.76]Do you enjoy feeling terrorized, humiliated, I mean, panicked?
[319:08.66]All those emotions that my sisters got to feel once, one year ago?
[319:13.30]Only guess what?
[319:13.94]They didn't get to laugh it off.
[319:15.24]No, no, no, no, no.
[319:17.40]They're gone.
[319:17.84]Who died?

[321:36.68]What if I picked the girl?
[321:37.44]I did not hurt Jessica.
[321:39.64]What if I picked the girl?
[321:43.56]Wouldn't I have found out that it was fake?
[321:44.90]Are you insane?
[321:45.92]Like, really?
[321:46.40]Do you not understand what you've done?
[321:48.60]I'm a healer, man!
[321:51.42]I wish I could go back and play that part again, and kill her.
[321:54.70]And be like, alright, I saved you!
[321:57.31]Like, now you're a fucking Muppet!
[321:59.31]What's going on?
[322:06.39]Weird.
[322:07.29]Well, maybe he would actually die, and this would, like, change, I don't know.
[322:10.53]Prank.
[322:21.02]Did you just, you feel a little, a little bit of pain?
[322:23.66]Right now, I am so, so sorry!

[322:28.50]Jesus, dude.
[322:29.02]Stop.
[322:30.24]Michael, I'm sorry, man.
[322:33.36]I can't tell you how sorry I am that something happened to Jessica, but I swear, I swear to you, I have no idea what happened to her.
[322:47.25]Something doesn't feel right here.
[322:50.85]Mike, something doesn't feel right about this.
[322:52.53]You're acting a little weird.
[322:53.45]I don't remember.
[322:53.91]Okay, you make another joke, you're dead.
[322:56.51]I'm just gonna say it.
[323:18.13]You make light of the situation one more time, and I'm gonna spill your brains on the side of the fucking chair over there.
[323:26.39]He's the internet.
[323:28.43]Don't do that.
[323:32.07]That's not a good idea.
[323:48.33]That's a bad idea.
[323:49.29]I told you not to make any more jokes.
[323:53.51]Yeah, he needs to shut up.
[323:54.41]Stop talking.
[323:55.63]Really, really, really need to shut up, man.
[323:58.97]Oh.
[324:00.09]That was a really worse way to say that.
[324:02.89]Oh, yeah.
[324:06.39]I mean, I don't even know what you mean because I don't have anything to regret.
[324:13.80]Oh, my God.
[324:21.02]I mean, we're going to kill this guy, right?
[324:22.18]We were supposed to kill Josh a long time ago.
[324:25.24]He's going to get out.
[324:26.91]He's going to get out.
[324:27.45]No, just shoot him.
[324:28.65]He's killing him.
[324:29.07]He's got to go.
[324:30.37]Get rid of him.
[324:31.19]This guy's just going to be a menace for the rest of the game.
[324:36.13]He's going to get up.
[324:36.93]This is hard to watch.
[324:50.58]You ever see this kind of shit before?
[324:52.22]Oh, I've never seen him like this.
[324:56.80]We've lost him.
[324:57.88]You know what I mean?
[325:00.24]If he gets out and gets a hold of a knife, then we're all in trouble.
[325:04.07]I'm sorry, what did you say?
[325:10.11]Well, I said you're a dummy, dummy.
[325:12.35]What is wrong with you?
[325:13.53]Oh, Ashley.
[325:20.25]Oh, I never imagined in my wildest dreams that you liked me.
[325:24.61]Stop.
[325:27.03]You know what that sound is?
[325:28.01]It's the sound of never kissing Ashley, you pussy.
[325:32.05]Stop.
[325:33.38]You know, you might as well let Ashley.
[325:35.60]I'm going to have to use a little bit of physical reinforcement here.
[325:38.40]He's got some notches in his belt, you know.
[325:40.44]He'll treat her right.
[325:42.88]We've got to knock him out here.
[325:43.86]Fucking pathetic Christopher.
[325:45.65]I'm going to beat his head off.
[325:46.61]Don't listen to him.
[325:48.01]Not worth it.
[325:48.77]He's got to go.
[325:50.07]Hey, Mike.
[325:51.15]Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.
[325:52.49]Don't listen to him.
[325:53.65]Mike.
[325:54.21]What?
[325:55.47]What happened with Jess, Mike?
[325:59.70]You know what happened.
[326:00.96]No.
[326:02.00]No.
[326:02.86]Why talk to people with the gun and the board?
[326:05.16]I got a problem, Mike.
[326:08.07]I don't remember killing Jess.
[326:09.97]Jesus.
[326:10.81]Yeah, this guy's got to go.
[326:12.57]I'm sorry.
[326:13.67]He's got to go.
[326:14.75]Give me the aim.
[326:15.67]Just give me the aim.
[326:18.46]That's it.
[326:18.70]He's got to go.
[326:19.08]Dude, it's okay.
[326:31.84]Son of a bitch.
[326:33.26]Oh, shit.
[326:33.70]I'm trying.
[326:34.39]Dude, chill out.
[326:36.53]What the hell are you doing?
[326:39.13]You were going to shoot him.
[326:40.73]I was just messing with the man.
[326:42.13]I was trying to scare him.
[326:45.53]You have a taste of his own medicine.
[326:47.45]Well, what the hell, man?
[326:48.31]I could have killed him.
[326:49.81]At least he shut up.
[326:51.25]It's fine.
[326:51.87]He'll be fine.
[326:53.73]I didn't like doing that.
[326:55.05]Yeah, you did.
[326:56.05]Yeah, you did.
[326:56.49]It felt good.
[326:57.05]Admit it.
[326:57.91]He's quiet.
[327:01.85]You were holding a gun at him, so I had to hit him in the face.
[327:04.21]He was counter-pranking him.
[327:04.95]I feel like I don't know what the hell's even going on anymore.
[327:06.99]There it is.
[327:30.73]We're getting down to the final three chapters.
[327:33.81]Syringe clown is Josh.
[327:36.37]Josh!
[327:37.05]How does it feel?
[327:37.77]Do you enjoy all those emotions that my sisters got to feel once, one year ago?
[327:43.36]Only guess what?
[327:44.24]No, that's it.
[327:46.06]Nope, no, no, no.
[327:47.50]We gotta have this to do on Tuesday.
[327:49.26]Jessica's fucking dead.
[327:51.59]What?
[327:52.83]Did you hear me?
[327:54.71]Jessica is dead one more please do another one more It's getting late, it's getting late people a lot of people are from Europe like you know we're at like 1 a.m.
[328:12.42]We're good like five and a half hours almost six hours going this stream I don't want to keep everybody up like super super duper late
[328:23.02]Yeah, there's a lot of people that are in a state of real like... Alright, let's see what this is.
[328:29.42]And then we'll take off.
[328:30.98]Now they become werewolves again.
[328:36.72]So the flamethrower guy was not a bad guy.
[328:49.73]Or maybe he's one of the miners, and he's like trying to help us.
[328:55.70]I knew they were gonna throw a Home Alone bird lady at us.
[328:58.74]I knew it.
[329:01.38]I fucking knew it.
[329:04.18]The pigeon lady, remember, like he was so scared of her, and like, she's the bad guy, she's the bad guy, she's the bad guy.
[329:08.95]Nope, turns out she's the good guy.
[329:15.21]Alright.
[329:18.97]The Home Alone minor is going to save us.
[329:21.75]Well, we're back to being Emily, which I don't want to fucking be Emily anymore.
[329:24.04]All right, well, that's it.
[329:26.34]We've been going for just under six hours now.
[329:30.04]Spoilers for Home Alone 2, by the way.
[329:31.73]If you haven't seen Home Alone, like, you're not going to.
[329:37.08]They play Home Alone and Home Alone 2 back to back on Christmas, like for a week straight.
[329:44.95]You've had like probably 75 opportunities over the last three years at Christmas time for the week that they marathon it to see Home Alone.
[329:52.24]So I'm sorry that you didn't see it yet.
[329:53.44]The movie was made in 1993.
[329:59.50]But, before I go, thank you again to DubskiDude for the $2.
[330:06.61]The real antagonist in the game is Mr. Spaghetti Arms.
[330:09.75]You have to walk on the carpet.
[330:12.45]That's a Little Nightmares reference.
[330:13.85]I like it.
[330:15.49]Thank you for the $2.
[330:16.27]GummyMonk gave $5 a little while ago.
[330:18.43]You need to replay this and try to kill everyone as quickly as possible.
[330:21.98]I've never seen a speedrun of a movie.
[330:24.92]And it's a very interesting thought, but still have to watch all the cutscenes and walk all the walks.
[330:30.10]So it might actually be not so great, but it could be.
[330:34.72]Austin, thanks for the $1.
[330:35.48]Thanks a lot, guys.
[330:40.11]And we are going to pick this up on Tuesday.
[330:42.73]The conclusion of Until Dawn.
[330:44.57]We'll finish it.
[330:46.37]Get to the bottom of what happened.
[330:47.65]I'm not going to read anything.
[330:48.77]I'm just going to turn it off as is and bring it back literally from this point in the story.
[330:56.13]So, with that, thanks everybody for watching.
[330:58.53]And hopefully, uh... Oh, I just cut my mic off.
[331:02.94]Stayed up a little late tonight.
[331:04.68]But it's all good.
[331:08.98]That was a good, nearly, like, just under six hour stream.
[331:11.86]I'm happy with it.
[331:12.86]It was a good time.
[331:15.41]So, same time, Tuesday, 7pm, we're gonna finish this and we'll move on to something else on the PS4, whether that be Yakuza, or maybe I'll check, maybe, you know, it's been long enough, maybe something has come out on PSVR that would be fun to try.
[331:30.46]Maybe, I don't know.
[331:31.32]I'll take a look, we'll do a couple more PS4 games, because I'm assuming it's not gonna be more than a couple more hours in Until Dawn.
[331:37.80]So, have a great rest of your what's left of the night.
[331:44.27]Or morning for some of you guys.
[331:46.75]Take care, everybody.
[331:48.23]I'll see you all on Tuesday, 7pm.
[331:53.84]Good night.
[332:02.72]That's 7pm Eastern Time, by the way.
[332:04.24]I'm seeing some people write that in chat.
[332:05.82]7pm Eastern Time.
[332:06.58]Good night.
[332:23.99]you
