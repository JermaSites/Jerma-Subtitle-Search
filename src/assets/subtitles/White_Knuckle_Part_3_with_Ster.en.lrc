[ve:61.1.100]

[00:04.54]weird thing to come back to.
[00:06.50]I have something to share.
[00:07.28]You guys think this is interesting?
[00:09.79]I know that it's the summertime.
[00:11.67]Probably people are wondering, hey, are you still doing gardening?
[00:15.38]Yes.
[00:16.74]We had a small issue.
[00:21.65]We planted a bunch of stuff.
[00:24.37]Didn't do sunflowers yet.
[00:26.15]Probably gonna do those soon if we want to do them, but Holly and I have been taking care of our little flowers that have just started to kind of get bigger and sprouting and they've gotten taller.
[00:36.91]We had a massive problem.
[00:41.25]And it's a very cute massive problem, but we got a picture of it.
[00:45.28]Holly said that she was sitting there and she ended up looking out of the window
[00:51.18]And she said, oh my god, our plants.
[00:56.75]And this is the picture that she took.
[00:59.89]And I'm going to show it to you right now, because it was kind of like, oh no.
[01:04.46]We had a visitor.
[01:07.24]We did have a visitor.
[01:18.38]And here is that visitor.
[01:23.53]Just sitting in there, just eating them all.
[01:33.10]He ate almost, he ate almost all of them.
[01:37.90]The one that you see here is the tallest one.
[01:39.75]He got almost all the little babies.
[01:46.63]Hey, but at least we fed nature.
[01:48.98]How does that sound?
[01:49.66]Right?
[01:51.68]Little thief.
[01:55.76]I don't even know how he just jumped in there, I guess.
[02:02.29]It's a big chungus.
[02:05.21]It kind of is.
[02:05.77]It's like a hare.
[02:06.67]It's not even a bunny.
[02:07.71]That is a hare.
[02:13.32]Alright.

[04:09.54]Alright.
[04:16.13]So you, I can't play games like this, fresh like this.
[04:19.47]I can't.
[04:20.89]I'm going to be terrible for the first hour and 45 minutes.
[04:23.63]I'm a slow burn.
[04:24.35]Just train while I'm like setting up my scene real quick.
[04:27.22]Let me take a sip of my drink.
[04:28.20]Jump around.
[04:29.56]Yeah, take a sip.
[04:31.34]What is my stream title?
[04:33.08]Jams on Wahoo, Wahoo, Wahoo, Wahee, I think is your... Oh, no, no.
[04:36.94]Okay, we got it.
[04:37.48]One of the mods got it.
[04:38.45]White Knuckle Pro Training Session with Ster.
[04:41.65]That's good.
[04:42.15]That makes sense.
[04:43.39]Alright, you're saying just go for it and don't even think about it.
[04:45.37]Just go.
[04:47.18]Dude, I just said I had 200... I had more points than you right there.
[04:50.18]It was a bug, but I'll take it.
[04:57.11]Oh, it's a little loud.
[04:58.29]It's a little loud for me.
[04:58.97]Hold on.
[05:08.10]Okay, let's go.
[05:12.27]I don't like how fresh I feel.
[05:14.16]I said you just hop around, like, the lower floor real quick.
[05:18.07]Like, if you want to get, like, a quick reset in, get some grabs in, remember what you're doing.
[05:22.50]It's been two whole days.
[05:23.58]That may as well be, oh, like, three months for me.
[05:29.20]I have a really hard time transitioning between like we were just playing a controller game and then I touch my mouse and it's like I've never held one of these before.
[05:36.32]I'm so glad somebody has finally been able to get that articulated exactly how I feel about it.
[05:43.29]I'm so glad that you said it.
[05:45.67]Yeah, so just like hop around this room, die to the goo, and then we're like one real one.
[05:50.97]And I think you can do it.
[05:53.60]It's not over yet.
[05:54.66]Oh, okay.
[05:55.72]If this is the one, then this is the one.
[06:00.13]It's just that I saw you fall off the same wall like six times, so I thought you were practicing.
[06:05.53]Hey, you do you, I'll do me.
[06:08.36]That was just bad.
[06:15.18]Okay, and he remembers you don't have to, um, nail it in three times.
[06:20.09]Uh, oops.
[06:24.05]Just call me Safe Andy.
[06:31.85]Do you have a problem with what I just did?
[06:37.26]Oh, no.
[06:38.22]Did that really set you off?
[06:39.79]I mean, I heard.
[06:41.69]Well, I'm taking some notes here.
[06:44.79]What is he going to do with all those items?
[06:46.58]I wonder.
[06:48.02]They have it three times, I think.
[06:50.96]I'm just looking to see what's over here.
[06:52.27]Oh, climbing the vent.
[06:53.19]Okay, okay.
[06:56.61]I think you'd be proud of that one.
[06:57.99]I am proud of that one.
[06:59.65]It took you... It takes people in general some time before they realize they can grab a lot of that stuff.
[07:05.30]You can make this jump no pittin'.
[07:06.64]You can do this jump no pittin'.
[07:07.82]You what?
[07:08.04]You can?
[07:09.12]Yeah.
[07:09.46]Don't do the pittin'.
[07:10.17]Really?
[07:10.47]Full extend that arm up on the ladder, then jump.
[07:16.17]Like, grab the tippy-tippy.
[07:17.51]Oh, man.
[07:17.81]You actually can.
[07:20.26]Well, that's crazy.
[07:22.08]Yep.
[07:22.32]Pro strats.
[07:27.42]Dude, he's standing on his tippy toes.
[07:32.50]OK, you'll be proud of this one.
[07:42.10]Epic.
[07:43.89]OK.
[07:46.79]Oh, so I finally caught up and watched you getting to the elevator shaft.
[07:50.78]Very proud of you, by the way.
[07:52.08]Yeah.
[07:53.34]You did lose one point for walking back and forth for 10 minutes, saying, which room do I climb?
[07:59.73]Okay, let me- And then chat said the main one, and then you walked back into the tiny little hallway again.
[08:06.28]I know, but here's my problem, right?
[08:07.68]I don't know if there was- I didn't even know the goo.
[08:10.09]I didn't know the goo was not present at that point.
[08:13.42]I thought I was still the goo is coming.
[08:15.30]I don't know where to go.
[08:15.95]Panic setting in a little.
[08:19.37]I know you didn't seem that panic.
[08:20.79]I was internally dude.
[08:21.89]My hands were shaking after that.
[08:24.58]Good I was it was.
[08:27.82]It was the most adrenaline.
[08:28.86]It was a massive adrenaline dump, so I'm just sitting there trying to let the adrenaline just clear the system.
[08:33.59]You know what I mean?
[08:35.69]It was still there into the 20 minutes into that next run.
[08:53.01]See, this is going smooth.
[08:54.85]It's going alright.
[08:56.84]I mean, I'm alright with the Act 1.
[08:59.24]Act 1 seems pretty... At least some of the new areas that they've thrown at me, though, have been a little weird.
[09:06.65]Oh yeah, because you unlock new zones as you go.
[09:10.39]I got a lot of good items, though.
[09:11.96]New substructures.
[09:16.36]I want to put this away.
[09:18.12]Is it not in my hand?
[09:22.58]what the hell just happened that was okay I just duped an item no you did not I could explain very easily what just happened but you're fine you're doing great don't focus on that I know I know I nailed it in glitch
[09:55.21]I nailed it in.
[09:55.79]I know you're going to be disappointed in me.
[09:57.92]I'm not.
[09:58.48]I'm proud of you, honey.
[10:00.52]You're doing great.
[10:04.85]Alright.
[10:06.10]Okay, so we're at the break time.
[10:10.22]This is classes in session.
[10:13.95]I would like to get an assessment of how I just did.
[10:17.47]um good no I think you were you started a little rough like you said but I think it was a confident nice paced climb uh no rush you know nice nice climbing all around good job excellent thank you chef yes chef chef behind behind okay I have a question pro um teacher yeah
[10:44.40]Eight minutes, does that mean when I click purchase, eight minutes begins to count down?
[10:50.77]Yes, and if you press tab to look at your inventory, you can see the timer of it running down if you were curious.
[10:57.26]Okay, so I've just got a suggestion.
[11:04.20]That should start counting down when you leave the break room.
[11:08.17]No, no, when you buy it.
[11:09.71]Oh, that's the suggestion?
[11:11.09]That's my suggestion.
[11:11.91]Nah.
[11:13.03]Nah?
[11:13.33]Nah.
[11:14.44]No, you buy it.
[11:15.20]It happened.
[11:16.78]You can't pause time.
[11:17.90]Yeah, but what if I want to look around?
[11:19.39]What's the lore behind your upgrade waiting for you?
[11:23.89]You can look around before you buy it.
[11:25.19]But what if I want to... You're right.
[11:26.62]Never mind.
[11:26.94]That was a bad suggestion.
[11:30.42]Sorry, dude.
[11:33.12]You're just like a bug tester.
[11:34.59]You don't get to decide these things.
[11:39.01]You're a bug purchaser, putter renter.
[11:42.18]Dude, you'll one-shot Act 3 if you disassociate to Mario music again.
[11:46.81]Disassociating to Mario music has got me into trouble one of those times.
[11:50.28]I don't want to do that.
[11:50.94]It has to be the right one.
[11:51.70]It has to be the right song.
[11:52.62]You can't do the wrong one.
[11:54.90]No, I really screwed myself with Skull Monkeys.
[11:57.97]I thought that putting the Chiller one... No, that was a big mistake.
[12:01.61]There's so many more bangers on that album.
[12:05.38]That was a massive mistake.
[12:07.60]Okay.
[12:11.36]You asked for my soundtrack and I hit you with smell of the game and I think you had to detox from that and that's why you listened to like cowboy yodeling in barn after that.
[12:22.81]That was not what that was.
[12:23.94]Have you played the Neverhood?
[12:26.88]I watched you play.
[12:28.32]I watched your playthrough is all I know.
[12:30.60]Never happened.
[12:32.49]Never happened.
[12:33.27]You're talking about the sequel.
[12:35.80]Is there a Neverhood 2?
[12:37.34]I remember years ago you did it, like a long time ago.
[12:40.34]There is a... Oh, whoa, hold on.
[12:45.87]There is a... They did a Kickstarter a long, long time ago to make a spiritual kind of game in the same world as the Neverhood.
[12:54.30]Yeah.
[12:54.68]And it was alright.
[12:57.12]It was alright.
[12:58.00]The spirit was there, but... I remember that one.
[13:00.21]I just thought you also did the original.
[13:04.67]Okay.
[13:06.19]hey hey slow down slow down oh my god slow down you're you're in the substructure you start talking about something else alright I'm good I'm good good you you had talked about your performance uh iq
[13:20.67]I can tell from your gameplay.
[13:22.77]I was watching the other day and just laughing that it feels like, oh my God, man, this man.
[13:27.69]I'm listening to you.
[13:28.75]I can't listen and do anything.
[13:30.02]That's what I mean.
[13:30.64]If you're listening and playing, you cannot... I was laughing that you are a single core CPU.
[13:40.23]He's got like a five gigahertz single core.
[13:44.61]It's overclocked.
[13:45.67]And if you try and get it to do something else...
[13:49.35]It's not going to happen.
[13:50.50]It's not going to go the way you want.
[13:51.82]That's like a 7 gigahertz single core though, isn't it?
[13:56.30]Yeah, no, I'll give you that.
[13:59.57]But if you open like an empty Word document, there's going to be some hiccups.
[14:05.86]Stop saying it.
[14:06.98]I can't go.
[14:08.06]My single core CPU can only listen to that.
[14:13.25]Dude, do they even make single core CPUs anymore or no?
[14:16.76]I don't even think games run on like if you don't have at least the duo core.
[14:19.84]I don't think they work.
[14:22.71]Or I might be thinking of something else.
[14:24.95]You gotta focus on this room.
[14:25.98]This is I know this room is a rough one.
[14:28.16]It's going to get you.
[14:31.51]My hand is broken.
[14:45.80]anybody food I do oh pizza don't say that I want it I tell my chat there's no rules it's literal anarchy but if you say if you mention food I'm gonna end stream like you're you're just causing the end it actually is a problem it's a huge issue oh shit I'm good
[15:15.94]That one asshole is in a bad spot.
[15:27.38]We're good.
[15:30.34]I don't want to spoil it for you, but I fell and I lost.
[15:32.82]Did... No?
[15:36.51]No.
[15:38.61]No.
[15:39.79]Am I?
[15:39.91]Oh, I have the... No, okay.
[15:41.04]I didn't want to jump and lose, but... Oh, shit.
[15:43.92]I'm good.
[15:46.60]Sometimes I need a second.
[15:55.17]You're doing a lot of stuff that makes it look like you are, but you haven't.
[15:59.74]This is one of my least favorite rooms in the whole game.
[16:01.90]This is?
[16:03.16]Yeah.
[16:05.17]Not like favorite, like I hate it.
[16:08.17]Personally, it's rough.
[16:10.59]It's like deceptively simple rough.
[16:13.16]It is weird, but you just gotta kind of
[16:20.32]Oh yeah, when you get the the flying bugs in here.
[16:24.92]Do you OK?
[16:25.37]Do you have to hit them three times or is that something that it has to be free?
[16:29.67]But unless you have like one of the hammer upgrades.
[16:34.36]For a brick, I see your chat was telling me throw bricks at walls a lot and then complain about bugs and they were upset about it.
[16:41.53]Well, you know what?
[16:42.51]Sorry, you know, sorry to break that to you, but they were upset.
[16:45.45]Take it.
[16:45.74]They'll be alright.
[16:46.48]Don't don't.
[16:47.28]Hey, you two handed the whole way up.
[16:48.62]Don't do that.
[16:49.46]Yeah, but who cares?
[16:50.42]I beat it.
[16:53.15]Okay.
[16:53.37]Good point.
[16:54.93]To me, this is my fun time, where I get to just kind of jump up there like crazy for fun.
[17:00.82]You gotta get the secret in this room now.
[17:02.70]Okay, so what are you talking about?
[17:04.88]Behind the toilet lid.
[17:07.23]Close the toilet lid first so you don't die.
[17:09.49]Close this first.
[17:14.48]And then climbing up the wall behind the toilet.
[17:18.60]I'm up the wall.
[17:21.03]My labs are probably delayed, but... No, just... No, no, no, no.
[17:24.25]Like, the wall behind it, where it says SB17 or whatever, there's a ladder up there.
[17:28.70]I can grab... Oh, I guess I can throw an item or something, right?
[17:31.24]Yeah, you can pit him up there.
[17:33.88]Look at that.
[17:44.26]Okay.
[17:44.62]All done.
[17:46.35]so what's up here what's this there's a little note and uh you gotta save that guy save this guy okay we're counting on you to save him so just use that guy and then what where do I use him do I eat him you'll know you put him in the bug machine well you can like pet him because he's cute
[18:15.76]Okay.
[18:19.26]That was sad.
[18:22.69]You pressed the wrong button.
[18:24.15]You did not pet him.
[18:27.03]I mean, there was only one button I could press.
[18:29.62]That's rough.
[18:30.26]Okay.
[18:33.56]I pet him too hard?
[18:42.31]Wow.
[18:42.58]I can't believe you would do that.
[18:45.10]Holy shit, that's so many rebarbs in one box.
[18:48.87]How did they fit in there?
[18:52.57]Yeah, make sure we're saving.
[18:54.62]I'm saving.
[18:57.78]Also, your score is based on how quickly you climb.
[19:01.47]So when you stand still in this room in AFK, that is why your score does not improve.
[19:06.75]I don't care.
[19:08.42]Okay, I'm just saying.
[19:09.30]I'll be at 1,000 point, Andy, forever.
[19:12.04]I need my time here.
[19:14.26]I take a lot of time in the bathroom, right?
[19:16.07]Even when I'm done going to the bathroom, I'm not leaving.
[19:19.15]What do you mean you're not leaving?
[19:24.98]I'm not leaving yet.
[19:25.92]I'm not done yet.
[19:28.44]When Jerma runs an ad and he gets up and he says he'll be right back, he goes into the bathroom apparently and he stands there with the door closed and the light off.
[19:37.32]He just stands still.
[19:38.70]Alright, this is kind of a big deal.
[19:40.40]This is actually kind of a massive deal.
[19:44.77]It's expensive, but it's one of the best.
[19:48.14]Yeah.
[19:53.76]Alright, so now we gotta get that game saved.
[20:09.36]OK.
[20:09.44]Very nice.
[20:11.50]I think this could be.
[20:13.42]Oh my God.
[20:17.68]Yeah, you're a little.
[20:18.46]You're a little rebar heavy here.
[20:22.63]Well, it'll be fine.
[20:24.47]Because when I get to the end, you know it's pronounced petons or or something like the actual way you say that thing.
[20:30.25]I'm sure it I mean it's like.
[20:33.44]Tomato tomato.
[20:36.72]Rebar rebar rubarb.
[20:45.31]I thought I was already up.
[20:58.94]is there a better way to get bricks are the best way to deal with those you said yeah brick one shots them okay but brick does not one shot the tentacle guys okay so actually a lot of the times through sewers um I will keep a brick in one of the quick swap hands that's like a good idea
[21:42.68]Well, I wish I did that 10 times faster, but whatever.
[21:46.21]Oh, bug.
[21:54.72]What in the name of goodness just happened?
[21:59.73]Beep.
[22:01.65]Annoying.
[22:12.28]No, I don't want to grab.
[22:15.50]Oh, that's a classic.
[22:17.19]Oh, I thought you could never mind.
[22:34.27]I need that hand to get better.
[22:41.44]That's not what I wanted to grab.
[22:44.66]You got it.
[22:45.40]You're doing the hand switching good.
[22:47.09]You probably didn't even need to with the drink.
[22:49.61]The can of soup.
[22:50.85]I got scared.
[22:53.22]What is it for you in your mind?
[22:55.12]What's in that?
[22:57.06]Spinach.
[22:58.62]Spinach.
[23:03.15]That's weird.
[23:04.83]Are you a canned spinach eater?
[23:06.41]Is that a thing you do?
[23:07.66]Have you ever seen Popeye?
[23:09.81]Yeah.
[23:11.25]And it gives him strength.
[23:12.99]Oh, no.
[23:13.41]Okay.
[23:13.87]Okay.
[23:14.25]I see where you're coming from.
[23:15.36]I'm sorry.
[23:18.28]Whoops.
[23:19.42]It's fine.
[23:21.39]I didn't want to put it in my inventory because I knew I wasn't going to.
[23:24.97]You got so many.
[23:25.77]I don't like where he is.
[23:36.59]At reach, I'm not using it as well as I should be, honestly.
[24:07.23]forgot you even had it I did too oh don't do that oh why are you oh man with the reach even I I don't know how I didn't get it with I thought the reach that's why I did it the only reason why I jumped from there is because I thought the reach was far enough I guess it wasn't
[24:30.33]Was that a mistake?
[24:31.05]70 rebars.
[24:32.26]Was that a mistake?
[24:32.88]No, that was not a mistake.
[24:34.76]Okay.
[24:35.78]What do you mean was that a mistake?
[24:37.40]You're dead.
[24:38.42]I know, but if I had the 50% reach and I was like, I got it for sure.
[24:41.48]Was that a mistake?
[24:45.13]I think you just mis-aimed.
[24:46.95]You were a little... You like jumped to the side of the grab hold.
[24:51.37]Damn it.
[24:55.44]Emergency evacuation route through drainage system has been...
[24:58.57]Okay, what does a grub do?
[24:59.73]Um... This dude's asking for spoilers.
[25:07.42]Okay, don't.
[25:10.96]I can tell you it's not a big deal.
[25:12.24]Is there anything in a box?
[25:14.87]No.
[25:15.75]Ever?
[25:15.97]Okay, so there's no reason.
[25:18.17]Yeah.
[25:21.66]Oh, the grub, when you crush it and your hands get all sticky because you've killed an innocent, it lets you climb walls without handholds.
[25:29.94]Wait, what?
[25:32.22]Yeah, you can just spider up a wall for a duration.
[25:35.62]Damn.
[25:36.34]Okay.
[25:44.74]So you should hold on to those forever.
[25:47.24]Well, you should hold on to them and take care of them and not kill them.
[25:52.55]I think it's the whole point.
[25:53.81]So don't kill them.
[25:54.99]There's a reason why you shouldn't.
[25:57.53]Because of morality.
[26:00.13]You sociopath.
[26:03.11]There's a reason you shouldn't kill?
[26:04.65]Okay.
[26:05.47]We're going to have to talk about that one.
[26:08.60]Yes.
[26:08.96]The guy that says, hey, you can pet him.
[26:11.26]And I press the pet button and I crush him.
[26:13.60]You led me down a path of destruction.
[26:16.08]It wasn't me.
[26:17.47]I'm the devil on your shoulder.
[26:20.37]All it takes is one grub.
[26:26.35]Oh, that was a risky play.
[26:27.91]But, you know, they don't call me Dribble985.
[26:31.36]Well, that one, I think, was the extra arm grab.
[26:36.84]That's what I thought was going to happen with the other one.
[26:38.18]Maybe I just missed it, like you said.
[26:40.31]Yeah, you were maybe missed.
[26:49.26]I don't like this placement.
[26:52.68]He's got me.
[26:54.77]What?
[26:55.59]I guess he didn't.
[27:05.55]Any bullshit?
[27:25.77]Nope.
[27:25.89]Rest that arm.
[27:32.46]Ooh, oh geez.
[27:35.79]Oh, gosh.
[27:38.75]Steam.
[27:40.32]I get it.
[27:41.04]What do you think about the name Pipe Organ?
[27:43.70]Pipe Organ?
[27:44.26]Let's go.
[27:53.70]That's cool.
[27:55.00]I like it.
[27:56.60]Okay.
[27:58.65]Come on, dude.
[27:59.35]I'm doing my tech.
[28:00.95]The run tech.
[28:08.39]Guys, I think he's reaching the flow state.
[28:16.15]Give the alt meter building.
[28:22.43]Bad day to be those bugs.
[28:35.78]Yeah, I really thought I was jinxing it.
[28:37.36]You're pretty aggressive through there, pal.
[28:39.20]It was very aggressive, yeah.
[28:41.05]Well done.
[28:45.81]Sometimes you just gotta go.
[28:46.91]Actually, I like to go really fast through those levels because I just, I don't like them.
[28:58.58]You just gotta screw through them.
[29:01.53]Yeah, you can spend a lot of time in there in the goo.
[29:04.37]That's what I learned is, ooh, it's a daisy.
[29:07.03]Is that area in particular, the game almost kind of is like, oh, be careful.
[29:10.78]There's like steam and there's like little things you can get hurt by.
[29:15.06]No, just go.
[29:16.52]Spend way too much time just waiting around.
[29:17.79]This one too, especially.
[29:20.27]When I first, the first like five to 10 times I got to this place, I was like, mm, okay, let me stand in the, wait, where's the steam?
[29:30.83]Well, yeah, you were saying, you even messaged me, you're like, oh, the steam sucks, like, come on, doesn't the steam suck?
[29:36.63]Yeah, I was trying to get you to tell me.
[29:37.90]You're pretty good at, like, grabbing your fall.
[29:41.06]Like, oh, I push me, but, like, you can usually salvage.
[29:44.42]I was trying to get you to be, like, I was doing the thing where you don't like something, so you just be like, I'm gonna make the other person say they don't like it, too.
[29:53.12]The validation technique?
[29:54.48]Yep.
[29:55.36]Oh, shit.
[29:56.46]I'm good.
[29:58.05]I mean, this room is hard.
[29:59.49]That was ballsy, but I'm okay.
[30:01.89]Deceptively hard.
[30:04.97]Deceptively?
[30:06.66]Yeah, deceptively.
[30:07.64]I'm gonna slow this down a second just to get past this.
[30:11.72]Okay, we're good.
[30:21.22]Yikes, okay.
[30:25.38]I want that.
[30:26.30]Hold on.
[30:26.99]I know it's going to happen right now.
[30:28.65]Yep.
[30:33.89]That is some long reach.
[30:35.86]It is very long.
[30:36.72]And actually, that was the only reason why I just did that.
[30:43.71]It used to be 75.
[30:44.75]And it stacks.
[30:47.05]So one of my early runs, I had two.
[30:50.60]It stacks?
[30:52.14]Yeah.
[30:52.74]Holy shit.
[30:55.27]Alright, where are we going?
[30:56.05]We're going this way.
[30:56.75]The magneto run.
[31:02.16]Can't get, uh, I can't get around that?
[31:03.64]Yeah, I can.
[31:07.80]Dude, I ate every fucking point of the- What's going on?
[31:10.77]I can't move!
[31:12.01]No, what the fuck?
[31:12.65]Why is he opening his mouth and looking at it?
[31:14.25]I was tra- Why is he opening his mouth?
[31:15.83]No, dude, I was trapped.
[31:16.69]I actually- Oh my god, it killed you.
[31:18.44]I couldn't move.
[31:19.70]I actually couldn't move.
[31:20.44]I was stuck.
[31:21.32]I was stuck wherever I just was.
[31:22.48]I couldn't get out.
[31:24.48]You could have walked backwards.
[31:27.06]Every area besides probably maybe... I actually couldn't move.
[31:31.59]I was pressing W. I was pressing A. I was trapped there.
[31:34.85]I was actually stuck.
[31:37.01]Unfortunate.
[31:37.55]That was a solid run.
[31:38.73]You had it until you opened your mouth into the steam vent.
[31:45.60]Well, there was that.
[31:48.52]Yeah, it was a situation like this.
[31:52.13]Wait a minute.
[31:55.11]Wait a minute.
[31:57.61]Wait a minute.
[31:58.13]Why is that not happening anymore?
[32:01.11]I think just that first floor one is different, maybe?
[32:04.34]Yeah, I was... Because that one doesn't close.
[32:06.34]It was like a situation where I turned, I was pressing W. I was trying... I think, like you said, if I just turned around and just walked that way.
[32:14.63]But I was... It looked like it was open.
[32:16.95]I was trying to go forward.
[32:18.21]Dude, it was open.
[32:19.03]I was trying to go forward.
[32:21.03]You just had to walk backwards.
[32:24.55]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[32:26.00]Sometimes you gotta go forwards to go backwards.
[32:28.22]Yeah, but I mean, that looked pretty wide open for me to walk through.
[32:34.89]Run it back.
[32:35.37]You do a VOD review.
[32:36.63]You'll see.
[32:38.82]I know that spot.
[32:41.08]I'm aware.
[32:42.28]I've been pushed into that corner.
[32:43.46]The steam pushes you there.
[32:45.06]You just gotta recalibrate.
[32:48.27]Where was my coach screaming at me to recalibrate?
[32:51.59]I...
[32:53.04]genuinely did not know you could die to the steam vents dude I fucking died to them alright okay so I would have like been like oh I did not know that could happen I mean I like maybe it makes sense yeah there's a lot of omega lulz in chat you you if you were sitting in the chair you would have done the same thing it was uh look it was as open as this is what is he showing a picture of his ass on stream
[33:24.14]Oh, there was a disk in that room.
[33:32.17]Disk, disk.
[33:33.03]Back in that room.
[33:33.81]No, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back to the room that you jumped into the cargo thing with.
[33:39.03]The save disk.
[33:42.58]Oh, you made this?
[33:43.26]Oh, cool, man.
[33:46.48]Who cares?
[33:47.16]It's going to be lore.
[33:48.20]I want to go quickly.
[33:49.74]I don't care about lore.
[33:51.47]You can have two saves.
[33:53.03]Oh, that's right.
[33:55.00]What the heck, dude?
[34:00.57]Look how much I don't give a fuck.
[34:03.27]I actually need these.
[34:05.68]Give them back.
[34:06.54]I need these.
[34:13.75]Almost.
[34:18.55]It does work.
[34:19.35]He wasn't lying.
[34:28.32]Alright, I gotta stop playing like I have the extra reach because I feel like I have it and I don't.
[34:45.24]There are like genuine things that I'm seeing you do that every time I watch like anyone play, I learn like, oh, I guess you could go like that way instead.
[34:54.69]Because there's so many different routes in every room.
[34:57.17]I think that's one of the main reasons why I really love the game.
[35:01.80]Because it really does feel like there's not really a wrong answer to anything.
[35:07.11]I love that.
[35:09.42]I don't care.
[35:09.94]I know you can probably do this with skill.
[35:23.58]All personnel are to report to the lowest levels.
[35:28.03]Any resistance will be met with our security force.
[35:35.43]Oh, he's getting cute with it.
[35:40.42]Hey, I learned from the best.
[35:45.60]Alright, so what is preventing you from being 248 instead of 249?
[35:52.05]What's the bottleneck for you?
[35:55.64]I was doing one run at the end of streams and like the last two consecutively, I was feeding my time a lot.
[36:01.31]I just kind of haven't been doing it.
[36:03.35]But you do need a little bit of RNG of like if you get things like that grub, you can save a ton of time.
[36:09.93]I think I would just have to do more.
[36:15.93]the person that's in the top whoever's in the top 10 how what is their run how long is it how long is your full run of the early access um I mean where was I I don't think I've ever even time so in norm in normal mode with the vendors restock if you just have full bugs you can go obscenely fast so there was like I think like a nine minute run
[36:40.30]Nine minutes.
[36:41.62]Yeah, but I usually play there's a hard mode and then there's an iron knuckle mode where you cannot save and you cannot use vendors and you don't get perks.
[36:52.55]Where I do it in like.
[36:55.46]I think I got a 17 minute.
[37:00.61]I forget.
[37:12.31]But yeah, for that, I'm talking specifically about that one where you don't get to fill the vendor.
[37:17.41]So it relies a little bit more on RNG if you get items or not in certain spots.
[37:22.66]I tried to get too cute with it.
[37:34.13]Okay.
[37:38.81]Dude, that vending machine is full of juice.
[37:41.71]Is it?
[37:44.57]Juice, juice, juice.
[37:45.59]You won like the slot machine on the left one.
[37:47.68]Holy shit, I did.
[37:48.92]Why do I only have 15?
[37:50.18]Oh, because I used the reach.
[37:54.22]See, this guy's only got 15.
[37:55.67]That sucks.
[37:56.81]Alright, so you say I should never take this.
[37:59.67]Me in particular with my 7 gigahertz single core processor.
[38:04.32]I...
[38:05.21]which one the left one the climbing speed or the mat which one left one yeah just say direction left um no I don't think that you should I think that you just start climbing absolutely wild and the mass speed is going to panic you I think that's a total debuff to your single core okay the other one is like more you that's your speed the mass is slower you're a little but I wouldn't take either if I were you I would just go like normal core normal
[38:33.66]Yeah.
[38:34.92]Okay.
[38:36.90]I'm going to listen to the teacher.
[38:40.13]Like reduced climbing speed is not great.
[38:43.73]You feel it in the worst way because you might not feel it climbing just regular stuff, but you'll make one jump grab and that one tenth of a second of muscle memory you don't have from it ruins everything.
[38:56.44]If you think you can do a climb and then it's minus 20% speed, you don't need to die for that.
[39:03.60]You're gonna get to the elevator and you're gonna die for that.
[39:07.76]Well, I. I'm gonna I'm gonna go against the grain on you.
[39:12.83]Oh no, OK, we're getting the psycho run.
[39:28.11]I was saying it for the viewers.
[39:29.33]This is so much harder to watch.
[39:32.13]I tried to look out for you guys.
[39:41.03]You feel like a stretch Armstrong that's already stretched as far as he can go.
[39:46.14]He's got nothing left in him.
[39:48.26]It is kind of painful, but if you get it right, you can go flying.
[39:53.65]Jello guy.
[39:56.38]Hold on, my fan is blowing my hair in my face and it is pissing me off.
[40:01.77]Oh, I thought it was going to be like cinematic, like a movie.
[40:05.91]Air blowing in the breeze.
[40:08.30]Did I see a bug over here?
[40:10.74]A diamond bug?
[40:11.48]I don't.
[40:11.88]Did I?
[40:12.14]Am I crazy?
[40:13.52]I guess not.
[40:17.13]I saw a gold bug in there, but that's not what I want.
[40:24.72]see do you see how like much you're struggling in this room with the climb you were way smoother last time I'm just getting cute with it problem the seat will also makes you want to be cute you're already cute on average mode see he thinks he's got it like that and then he's down at the bottom
[40:56.83]sorry you alright and what do you call the you call it the goo
[41:19.27]I call it the goo, yep.
[41:22.86]These are important.
[41:24.82]I call it the Glorp.
[41:26.10]The Glorp?
[41:27.67]Yeah.
[41:29.15]Oh, hey, time to fucking lose!
[41:30.97]Here we go!
[41:31.61]Time to lose the whole game!
[41:48.52]oh my god what guy is that from like a movie I don't know that's some old I don't know holy shit in my fucking pants I thought it was over okay where is the exit oh yeah three stooges where's the exit going on
[42:21.73]In this game, you go up.
[42:32.92]No, you don't.
[42:33.66]You go sideways sometimes.
[42:36.88]That is real.
[42:38.34]That's base.
[42:41.53]Hey, you thought I was going to lose right there, but here we are.
[42:45.17]No, you thought you were going to lose.
[42:46.59]I was like, no, it's fine.
[42:47.99]Alright, is there a grub here?
[42:51.98]uh no that the thing the grub was at the top you ever do this it's not always there either it didn't work climbing speed sometimes you can just like dun dun dun dun dun dun dude's playing patty cake
[43:28.18]yeah a grub okay you're very lucky I think the first time you get it it's always there and then usually it's not really like it's like I don't know I don't know the odds but it's lucky you got it again
[44:05.91]Uh, people were saying that there's a, um... The disk?
[44:14.97]Do I have... I don't have to actually do the save after I do all the perks, right?
[44:19.91]No, that doesn't matter.
[44:20.85]Okay.
[44:23.28]But yeah, you can, um... Oh, no.
[44:28.56]I got it again.
[44:29.45]Dude, I got it again, and I have faster climbing speed.
[44:33.57]I'm doing it.
[44:34.84]Oh, this guy cannot climb any faster.
[44:40.61]Also, I'm going to go BRB.
[44:41.91]I'm going to pee.
[44:42.59]I got to get the piss out of my system, and I want to get a handful of sunflower seeds because I think this is probably the one.
[44:46.82]Okay.
[44:47.46]Make sure you don't forget to save twice.
[44:50.01]Actually, let me do that right now.
[44:51.01]What I was going to say is I don't know how you... Like, if you save here, I don't know if it counts...
[44:58.41]to respawn here or there.
[44:59.63]You know what I mean?
[45:00.29]The next one.
[45:01.37]I see what you mean.
[45:02.18]I have no idea.
[45:04.18]You should.
[45:04.88]I just do it.
[45:07.22]Okay.
[45:07.48]Should I do both?
[45:10.14]I don't think I need to do both.
[45:12.11]It will spawn you here.
[45:12.95]Maybe save the second one then.
[45:15.45]If I lose, I lose the other disk though.
[45:19.57]Yeah, but you're not going to.
[45:21.50]Okay.
[45:22.22]Alright.
[45:22.66]Let me piss this out of my system.
[45:27.17]What a massive hole.
[45:32.55]Let me just sit here and visualize you standing still in the bathroom with the lights off.
[45:36.48]That's fine.
[45:39.34]And he pulls back his jaw and the little alien in his throat comes out to breathe for one second.
[45:45.42]This fucking stream, man.
[45:47.03]I'm stressed out.
[45:48.69]I gotta breathe for a second.
[45:50.29]I'll be back in like three or four minutes.
[45:51.47]I'm gonna get a handful of pumpkin seeds.
[45:53.89]You're beat.
[45:56.07]Yeah, and then he comes back and he says, oh, my throat's weird because I had so many... The guy from Men in Black had so many bumpkin seeds.
[46:03.45]That's probably the reason it sounds like this.
[46:05.86]No one's going to be able to hear you.
[46:06.94]I'm so sorry.
[46:08.83]No, that's for the best.
[46:09.59]I understand.
[46:11.03]Okay, fair enough.
[49:34.05]And he's keeping it a secret.
[49:35.71]What's up?
[49:38.05]What do I do?
[49:38.77]What happened?
[49:41.36]I have a secret?
[49:42.10]What's your secrets?
[49:46.23]Did you know there's a bowling alley?
[49:47.77]Where you can go bowling?
[49:49.05]Yeah, I think I'm banished.
[49:49.79]Yeah, I don't know that he knows that he's muted.
[49:53.10]Or he still can't hear me.
[49:53.96]I don't know.
[49:54.56]Hey, so I said you had to put secrets over here?
[49:57.52]Secrets?
[49:57.86]Any secrets over here?
[49:59.10]What happened?
[49:59.97]No.
[50:01.23]Here we go.
[50:01.63]Ready?
[50:02.69]Alright.
[50:03.07]Yep.
[50:04.54]I'm ready.
[50:06.56]I'm going fucking crazy.
[50:09.01]Oh, we're getting a prediction coming in?
[50:10.85]Okay, let them vote.
[50:11.41]Vote yes.
[50:12.61]Vote yes?
[50:15.87]Okay.
[50:15.99]I think you had your warm-up.
[50:17.50]I think I did.
[50:18.96]I think you... got to the, you know... Let me turn my fan off.
[50:26.55]This is important.
[50:31.91]Gotta wait till it's, uh, it's oscillated.
[50:35.59]any second here okay now everyone vote no because the odds even out the odds so that the yeses can get more here we go almost just fell in at the first jump you you hit your head there too much
[51:09.95]I do think that that first jump is like demonically meticulously spaced so that it is somewhere where people will die.
[51:17.71]There's something weird about it.
[51:20.11]It feels like an intentional slight against humanity.
[51:26.22]Like a lot of this game.
[51:46.04]That's this big?
[51:46.66]You're going big?
[51:47.33]Big mode.
[51:48.21]I gotta get in front of that fucking thing, man.
[51:53.07]The gobble goo?
[51:54.06]Yeah.
[51:55.40]That's terrifying.
[52:06.56]It's moving 25% faster.
[52:10.28]Oh, yeah.
[52:10.52]I forgot you took that.
[52:11.72]Yeah, yeah.
[52:13.11]Well, then you don't want to see a big room like this with a bunch of bugs in it.
[52:17.08]No, I don't.
[52:18.80]I don't like how that guy's right there.
[52:19.96]They're slow.
[52:22.78]Just climb past them.
[52:25.19]Unless they hit their speed boost.
[52:37.24]Do I have food?
[52:37.92]I do, but I'm not going to use it.
[52:39.98]Oh, pizza.
[52:42.12]Ooh.
[52:43.00]This guy, are you eating like two handfuls of pumpkin seeds a day like you're a gerbil?
[52:49.09]What's wrong with pumpkin seeds?
[52:51.07]I mean, fine.
[52:51.71]I'm just saying, are you eating other things?
[52:54.05]Yeah, I only, guys, I only eat pumpkin seeds.
[52:56.50]You go get the pumpkin seeds out of your little tin bowl on the floor, and then you come back and go, well, that's all the food my masters gave me, you know.
[53:03.76]No.
[53:05.46]Alright, this is big.
[53:06.86]This is a big deal.
[53:07.78]I hate this room.
[53:08.38]This is my least favorite room in the entire video game.
[53:16.10]There's a simple route.
[53:19.86]Oh, don't.
[53:20.88]Why are you killing?
[53:21.71]I don't know.
[53:23.21]Just smash the grub and climb the wall.
[53:24.77]Do it.
[53:25.71]Just smash the grub.
[53:26.68]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[53:29.22]I'm going this way.
[53:41.62]Disk.
[53:42.68]Fuck.
[53:44.91]Oh, I could do a shit.
[53:47.47]This guy's got a whole computer.
[53:48.95]Drop the pitons.
[53:50.61]Pitons.
[53:52.60]Hell yeah.
[53:53.92]Beta?
[53:55.96]Beta?
[53:57.66]I got that reach.
[53:58.39]I need to use it.
[54:01.35]Lip.
[54:01.99]Are they alive?
[54:05.01]Watch out, bugs.
[54:06.26]Oh, they're alive.
[54:08.74]No, no, no, no.
[54:10.02]Dude, I've...
[54:11.76]Dude, take your time.
[54:14.22]This lip is fucking killing me.
[54:17.71]This shit's already here, bro!
[54:18.93]I gotta go!
[54:28.79]Nooo wayyyy.
[54:31.01]Does he panic... there?
[54:33.71]Dude, I... I didn't realize... Dude, okay, I have a question.
[54:38.56]You also... Hey, just throwing it out there, you could have climbed the opposite wall where they were not on.
[54:43.12]Okay, but hold on a second.
[54:44.08]Let me ask you a question.
[54:46.13]Okay.
[54:46.29]I went so unbelievably fast through... You didn't.
[54:51.87]How is it already right there after five seconds?
[54:55.02]Because you took the increased mass speed as well.
[54:58.38]Dude, I feel like I was screwing through Act 2.
[55:02.91]You weren't.
[55:04.19]I'm sorry.
[55:04.89]It was right fucking behind me!
[55:08.64]Well, that's a big room, like I said, like that room... You're- it's pretty normal to end up seeing it.
[55:14.43]Dude, those bugs are fucking so annoying.
[55:16.47]Those- fuck those things.
[55:19.19]You got to wait for them to get over to you if you don't have a projectile to throw at them.
[55:23.00]And then you hit them once and they do like a boom and fly backwards.
[55:28.09]Let me hit them three times in a row.
[55:29.41]You're trying to get the validation on this one, but I'm not going to give it to you.
[55:32.53]That's my own validation.
[55:34.26]I don't care about your validation.
[55:35.50]This is my opinion.
[55:38.92]Alright.
[55:40.95]It's just the wrong one.
[55:43.15]No, bugs are rough.
[55:44.96]Bugs are scary.
[55:47.40]I wouldn't... I wouldn't... Okay, if you... When you hit them with the hammer... Didn't you have a brick in your inventory?
[55:51.69]I don't know, dude.
[55:53.07]Probably.
[55:54.69]When you hit them with the hammer, they fly back.
[55:57.03]I just let them stay right there so I can fucking attack them.
[56:01.34]And then they have to... You missed a secret.
[56:03.42]What?
[56:04.70]Where?
[56:04.96]That's fine.
[56:05.82]Where is it?
[56:06.46]That's fine.
[56:07.81]Oh, now you got me all twisted up.
[56:10.11]The mass is coming, man.
[56:11.35]You don't have time for it.
[56:14.85]It comes.
[56:17.55]Look at it, he's blazing through Act 2.
[56:19.79]Well, dude, do you see how much faster I was going before I got annoyed at the bugs?
[56:24.58]And the lip, that's the lip part too.
[56:27.34]That lip stops you into a trap.
[56:28.59]Oh, don't give me any lip, mister.
[56:30.37]That lip is a brick wall.
[56:33.41]You can't walk over it, you have to jump over that fucking lip.
[56:37.86]Yeah?
[56:39.12]Why is that lip a giant brick wall?
[56:43.09]I mean, it's not like... The only place in the whole game where it's like that.
[56:46.36]It's not like the Great Wall.
[56:48.02]That's the only place in all three acts where I've seen that.
[56:54.51]It's just dark, you know?
[56:56.15]You need a flashlight.
[56:58.11]You need the flashlight, and you can look at it.
[57:00.10]Because then you're going to jump over the brick.
[57:04.26]Wall?
[57:05.38]What a dogshit fucking room this is.
[57:09.03]I'll see if the devil add a flat, uh, orange area with nothing in it.
[57:13.66]Like, uh, the orange maps in- in Source games.
[57:17.73]And then... I said, only place where there's a lip like that and you- it fucking just traps you.
[57:42.02]I didn't panic, see?
[57:44.20]Yeah, see, you got the steam reactions.
[57:45.99]They push you, you grab.
[57:47.13]You're good.
[57:58.54]Lots of money.
[58:04.90]And the game does have to be a slight to humanity as well.
[58:10.31]Or would it be without the lip?
[58:13.33]Dude, if I had a tier list of rooms in the game that I think, what is it, F tier?
[58:18.49]The big giant room with like the bugs and it's the massive one, the one that I died in right there.
[58:24.48]I think that is F. Yeah, I know the one.
[58:26.77]There's another one where there's way more bugs than the big guys in the middle.
[58:31.53]That's F tier.
[58:34.16]I used to think the steam room was F tier.
[58:35.88]No, actually, the steam room is actually kind of like B now.
[58:38.50]I actually kind of like it.
[58:40.15]I don't hate it now.
[58:50.21]This is the guy who died two runs ago to steam.
[58:54.50]Yeah, but I got stuck.
[58:56.02]He lost a run to air.
[58:57.84]Dude, but I got stuck.
[59:00.10]Not lost a run, lost his life.
[59:02.51]I got stuck.
[59:06.49]I breathe that shit.
[59:09.05]You die.
[59:12.02]Good, we got another one of these rooms.
[59:13.24]My favorite.
[59:19.76]I need that
[59:26.14]Come on, man.
[59:27.22]What is this?
[59:27.70]It's wedged in the corner.
[59:29.28]Another wedge.
[59:37.75]Yeah, maybe another whole day of white knuckle is not good for you.
[59:43.20]We're going to have another crash out.
[59:44.70]No, we're not.
[59:45.74]We're not going to have a crash out.
[59:47.33]It's building.
[59:48.49]Dude, I don't even know if this is a good idea, but I'm doing it.
[59:50.21]Because you taught me the fucking right way.
[60:07.32]Hey, don't get stuck.
[60:08.44]Learn from the best.
[60:15.51]Hey, learn from the best.
[60:24.88]Okay.
[60:26.04]Alright.
[60:26.56]Make sure you buy your 15 rebars, you cheater.
[60:31.23]Rebarbs.
[60:37.08]I don't have money to do anything?
[60:39.27]Sure.
[60:45.62]I don't like that setup.
[60:46.50]I gotta change this right now.
[60:48.88]Food up here.
[60:51.18]I'm gonna do three rebars.
[60:55.79]I got tons of items.
[60:57.85]Let's go.
[60:59.58]Need you to aim it.
[61:06.53]Like a sniper.
[61:08.37]Aim true.
[61:09.93]Can I hit them now?
[61:10.85]Oh, no, no, no, not now.
[61:13.62]But can I?
[61:14.22]Take your time.
[61:15.36]I mean, you could if you were insane.
[61:17.46]That's kind of awesome, though, dude, don't you think?
[61:21.84]I mean, you couldn't... Maybe I should be doing that.
[61:26.75]Wait a minute.
[61:28.55]I should be doing that.
[61:33.29]What the fuck are you talking about?
[61:35.18]Wait, wait, don't...
[61:37.63]You gotta go a little higher.
[61:39.89]Dude, what the fuck?
[61:41.94]No, no, no.
[61:44.06]You went the same height.
[61:44.86]You have to go a... I swear, go back to the last stream.
[61:50.85]Go back to the last stream and you see how much fucking higher all this was.
[61:55.02]All I'm saying.
[61:56.20]You're too high on two.
[61:57.69]No, I wasn't.
[61:58.35]I got it.
[61:59.47]I'm panicking, I'm panicking, I'm panicking.
[62:01.39]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[62:04.31]Okay, calm, calm.
[62:06.07]Just press the one button and you're good.
[62:08.06]We're home.
[62:08.50]We're back on the elevator.
[62:09.66]We're listening to some tunes.
[62:12.92]The goo is not coming.
[62:14.35]The goo is nothing.
[62:15.29]No, we're fine.
[62:15.67]The goo will be left behind.
[62:16.67]I got plenty of these.
[62:18.45]Do you have another rebar?
[62:19.79]No, I don't.
[62:23.52]Oh, no.
[62:26.60]If you fall, just grab.
[62:29.05]I'll pause if I fall.
[62:30.99]There's the, um... There's the poles that stick out on the edge.
[62:36.98]You always try and grab the one sticking out, but you can just shimmy along the red on the wall.
[62:40.56]I'm not even gonna need it.
[62:41.74]Not even gonna need it.
[62:42.34]He's not even gonna need it.
[62:43.62]He knows where to put the piton.
[62:45.29]He knows how to get back.
[62:46.33]I kind of forget, but I don't, but I do.
[62:48.51]You just got the one wall.
[62:50.03]The danger wall.
[62:52.39]Warning.
[62:53.60]Administrator is missing.
[62:55.66]Contacting emergency warfare protection crews.
[63:01.16]Error.
[63:02.30]No crews detected.
[63:04.75]Engage manual override.
[63:06.65]100%.
[63:16.17]I'm creaking!
[63:36.75]I had to reset.
[63:38.01]Lord, help him.
[63:38.99]No, seriously!
[63:39.32]You don't hit the hammer three times.
[63:40.66]You do not have... You one-hammer good.
[63:42.36]You can just jump down onto the box, and then there's floor.
[63:57.66]You don't have to pit in here.
[63:58.76]I need it, though.
[63:59.28]You do not.
[63:59.84]You do not.
[64:00.26]The up arrow is bait.
[64:01.49]The up arrow is bait.
[64:02.41]It's bait?
[64:03.87]It's bait.
[64:04.21]Just jump down onto the little box...
[64:07.04]and then onto the ground calm my boy calm there is time
[64:54.65]What happened?
[64:55.43]I couldn't grab, dude.
[64:56.75]I couldn't go around it.
[64:59.89]Oh, no.
[65:00.41]I didn't have any more pittance.
[65:03.98]That's rough.
[65:05.60]I couldn't get my body around it.
[65:08.74]I had no more pittance to hammer.
[65:12.89]Oh.
[65:13.19]I couldn't get around it.
[65:15.97]I couldn't get my body to mush around.
[65:18.61]Oh.
[65:24.95]Oh, man.
[65:29.92]God dang it.
[65:31.80]Was there anything I could have done at that point, or no?
[65:34.76]Was I just screwed?
[65:36.22]If you drop down to the bottom, you can climb all the way across the bottom, and I don't think the sludge was high enough yet.
[65:41.57]But the bottom climb back is actually easier if you're going to do that.
[65:45.25]And I think you could have, from the platform, jumped and grabbed around the corner, especially you had long arms that time.
[65:50.70]No, you had the climb speed.
[65:51.94]I was thinking about trying to jump, but...
[65:55.43]my in my brain it was like okay I can either try to jump and wrap my body around and grab as I cross it but it's like it's like could I grab I I honestly what you could have done you used two to three pittance you did not need there
[66:10.82]But you told me that thing was bait, and I was like, oh shit, maybe it is.
[66:15.31]No, no, on your way back, you were being so careful.
[66:20.07]I know, but I was terrified.
[66:20.95]There was a very simple jump or two you could have made.
[66:22.78]Yeah, I know, I know, man.
[66:23.82]Let's hold hands.
[66:25.08]Dude, my heart rate is probably like 500 fucking beats per minute right now.
[66:32.49]I was saying, I'm surprised.
[66:34.73]You said you didn't even want to play one, and then once you start, it's like, oh, I'm going again, right?
[66:39.94]Ugh.
[66:42.07]I was so... That was it, right?
[66:43.62]Okay, so you know what?
[66:44.50]You just opened my eyes like crazy, though.
[66:47.26]Yeah.
[66:47.38]I did not know that you could just jump from effectively that second platform.
[66:53.77]I've been so careful to try to get down there.
[66:55.84]I saw you piton all the way around and all the way onto the building wall through all these hand grabs.
[67:01.95]I didn't even know existed.
[67:04.67]Damn it.
[67:05.03]That was pretty good, though.
[67:06.95]You know what?
[67:07.32]If I were to rewind time and go do that all over again, I would have done this.
[67:12.31]Okay, let's just say that this is the corner.
[67:14.87]And, like, on the other side of the corner is where that piton was.
[67:17.68]I would have just tried one of these.
[67:19.73]And grab.
[67:21.89]You know what I mean?
[67:23.43]I think that was the scarier play in my brain, but that was probably the right play.
[67:27.88]You're pitting on the way in is in a weird place where you'll never be able to grab it on your way back.
[67:32.99]Yeah, that's true.
[67:38.03]You're hugging the wall like it's a tree with both arms around it to place the one that you're doing.
[67:44.46]It's true.
[67:47.17]Oh, man.
[67:47.99]I would be way more upset if I didn't get to Act 3 already, but...
[67:54.99]It still, ugh, it still hurts.
[67:57.15]I was thrown one little stupid fucking jump away.
[68:03.50]Alright, I want to watch you, let me watch you, can we watch you do one?
[68:06.32]We want to see the master at work.
[68:07.99]I'm surprised you're running it back.
[68:10.65]Let's see the master at work.
[68:13.29]I want to see how you do it.
[68:14.98]Alright, first I gotta go get my pumpkin seeds.
[68:18.74]Sorry, pumpkin seeds are fine.
[68:20.68]I do gotta pee, but I'm not gonna do it because it makes you more urgent.
[68:24.74]That's true.
[68:28.01]Alright, so can I, should I watch your stream or can you screen share without your computer exploding?
[68:31.85]I'll screen share.
[68:32.91]Yeah, my computer is functional.
[68:34.79]It works.
[68:35.90]Okay, good.
[68:38.78]Do you have one of those like don't work ones?
[68:42.53]Kind of.
[68:44.65]And I say that as someone who had to restart their whole stream earlier because I broke my audio setup completely.
[68:50.30]Doing a bit like today.
[68:55.03]Damn it.
[68:58.33]I'm just reliving and seeing the way I could have beat it.
[69:03.58]It's all good.
[69:11.15]Turn off hardware acceleration on Discord.
[69:12.75]It might help with the OBS and Discord stream share at the same time.
[69:16.44]I probably should just do that.
[69:27.50]I got the share up.
[69:30.70]Let me get it full screen.
[69:33.77]Alright, like now I need you to coach me.
[69:36.11]I'm not gonna be able to do that.
[69:37.91]I need you to tell me where to go.
[69:40.11]Hold on.
[69:44.14]They capture it onto my screen.
[69:50.15]That's source quality.
[69:54.89]How do you get rid of the little thing on the bottom so it actually goes full screen?
[70:01.39]I don't know.
[70:01.80]Anybody know how to do that?
[70:14.97]Pop it out?
[70:15.37]Yeah, I popped it out, but I want to make it big screen.
[70:22.96]Oh, there we go.
[70:23.44]Okay.
[70:32.13]That is very wise of you.
[70:40.84]We'd be showing her right now.
[70:48.73]That's weird.
[70:52.40]I can't see it.
[70:53.96]How come I can't capture this?
[70:55.64]That's very odd.
[70:56.66]Wait a minute.
[70:57.92]You're not just doing like a screen capture?
[70:59.69]That's what I'm trying to do.
[71:02.62]It's only showing my desktop.
[71:05.31]It won't show the actual screen.
[71:07.91]I think that is when hardware acceleration is turned on.
[71:10.11]It'll do that.
[71:11.40]So where do I turn that off?
[71:15.10]Whatever the opposite is, I don't know.
[71:16.94]Turn off hardware.
[71:17.80]Okay, I'm going to turn it off.
[71:23.31]Hold on.
[71:27.99]Why is it that hardware acceleration seems to be the worst thing to ever be invented, apparently?
[71:32.81]It decelerates everything.
[71:34.49]Like, it apparently makes everything bad.
[71:38.00]Why is it on everything, then?
[71:41.32]Where would this even be?
[71:42.42]Advanced?
[71:46.67]Oh, there it is.
[71:49.51]Okay, I just turned it off.
[71:50.19]This game looks weird to me.
[71:52.09]Like, I haven't played this in a while.
[71:53.24]This game looks weird.
[71:54.78]I have to restart my Discord, so I'll be right back.
[71:57.74]Okay.
[72:00.98]See if that fixed it.
[72:06.87]Yeah, it feels like every solution to every problem is like, hey, turn off hardware acceleration first because usually that will fix it.
[72:17.74]Let's see if this worked.
[72:27.34]Okay, pop this out.
[72:32.55]I guess that doesn't matter.
[72:33.61]Okay.
[72:37.04]Still doesn't want to show it.
[72:38.42]What the hell?
[72:45.74]I could just open your stream as well.
[72:48.04]Let me see if I can just get the actual window.
[72:50.75]Let me try this.
[72:51.27]Hold on.
[73:05.22]I might be able just to physically capture this window.
[73:08.25]It'd be great.
[73:16.19]No.
[73:30.25]yeah I could for some reason oh my obs does not want to show this on it's almost like there's like a weird like protection on it to not be able to capture this yeah that's that's just the hardware acceleration thing it does that for some reason I turned it off similar with some other things I'll just watch your stream I'm gonna play your stream up I'll be delayed but it's fine you were just delayed on mine you can turn it off let's go to your stream gonna open up Ster stream
[74:04.03]where did he go I ended the screen share but I left I clicked close call I hung up I thought you were gonna say you turned off the stream that would have been crazy the ultimate gambit oh yeah I thought we were gonna Discord so I just ended stream
[74:33.29]Okay.
[74:36.25]I can see, but I need to turn on the volume.
[74:37.88]Wait, where's my volume?
[74:38.76]I'm going to hear you twice.
[74:39.86]Do I need to hear you?
[74:41.52]I had you mute.
[74:42.66]I mean, I'm in the call.
[74:43.54]Yeah, you're right here.
[74:44.07]I just was playing like some ambience.
[74:46.07]Alright.
[74:46.47]What is this?
[74:47.63]Where are we?
[74:48.53]I don't know.
[74:51.76]And why do you have feet?
[74:57.97]Caught.
[75:01.51]So you're using a mod?
[75:04.96]Yeah.
[75:09.71]You know what I always say?
[75:10.65]What if Elden Ring was about feet instead of the fingers?
[75:14.17]And I just really wanted to see that come to life.
[75:16.60]Dude, that is some, like, Ren and Stimpy Nickelodeon ass feet, by the way.
[75:22.16]Wait, I need something you can grab.
[75:27.87]You'll see.
[75:28.67]It's like when you grab ledges, actually, you can see it.
[75:31.47]This is so stupid.
[75:35.09]Okay, this changes the whole game.
[75:37.03]This would mess up my gameplay.
[75:38.35]By the way, this would be terrible.
[75:41.44]I don't know.
[75:42.36]You haven't seen I have the whole I have a whole white knuckle.
[75:47.57]Like webcam filter.
[75:49.23]Do you really?
[75:49.93]Yeah, hold on.
[75:59.62]For when I want to be in the game.
[76:01.75]Okay.
[76:07.18]It's me.
[76:07.94]So these are supposed to be your feet.
[76:11.95]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[76:13.98]Yeah, but you should have the camera, you should be, the camera should be at the back of your head.
[76:18.47]I hear that a lot, unfortunately.
[76:21.18]Like, that would be great.
[76:21.90]I don't like it when I make eye contact.
[76:23.33]You should have a camera set up and enlarge the webcam so it's your head.
[76:27.50]So it's like your head and your shoulders and it's just get the back of your from like your shoulders up and enlarge it to like three or four times what it was and have it facing right in the middle like you just had it.
[76:38.15]Perfect.
[76:40.97]Okay.
[76:41.89]Alright, so let's see how this works.
[76:42.83]I'll do that.
[76:43.13]Let's see how the master at play.
[76:48.54]I'm going to go a little slow.
[76:49.80]Okay.
[76:56.76]I can't get over this feet thing.
[77:02.99]It really elevates it, doesn't it?
[77:06.47]I will say, what is messing me up is the fact that the hands are still the indicator on the screen.
[77:11.06]It's not feet on the screen.
[77:13.38]For the UI.
[77:16.38]Yeah, yeah.
[77:17.60]Oh, he fell!
[77:18.42]He fell!
[77:19.06]He fell!
[77:19.60]I was goof!
[77:19.84]I was the first run!
[77:20.93]You lost your first run!
[77:21.99]That's true.
[77:22.61]I saw you lose your first run!
[77:31.59]Wait, what?
[77:33.77]I'm lost.
[77:34.39]Oh, I did it backwards.
[77:35.50]It's been a minute, actually.
[77:37.44]It's been a minute since I've played.
[77:38.88]I gotta put on some Mario music for you.
[77:43.02]Been a minute.
[78:00.40]We need some ambience here for our- for us.
[78:05.88]Dude, it is- it has been- you know what?
[78:08.85]My fucking hero is watching me right now.
[78:12.03]My fucking hero is watching me right now.
[78:14.00]This is my hero.
[78:15.92]This one for real.
[78:16.94]That was the warm-up.
[78:17.80]Dude, it like- it weirdly said what you said like three times.
[78:22.87]Because I didn't have you muted.
[78:25.33]Oh.
[78:26.13]My hero.
[78:26.73]My hero.
[78:26.99]My hero.
[78:27.57]Academia.
[78:28.63]Academia.
[78:30.67]I launched the game and I was telling my chat like this game looks different to me well you you used to see in hands or on this screen okay that is weird to be eating that with your feet like that that's funny
[78:59.93]You know, you do what you gotta do.
[79:01.27]I want to see you throw a rebar with this.
[79:04.04]This would be great.
[79:17.30]Dude is just perplexed by my toes.
[79:20.36]It is very perplexing.
[79:30.90]This song is making it more perplexing somehow and more whimsical.
[79:37.97]Okay, what I'm seeing on the screen and this music is this is a different game.
[79:41.31]This is not even like a scary game.
[79:42.59]This is a funny, whimsical game with a guy with the orchestra behind him.
[79:47.40]It's funny.
[79:48.12]He's jumping around with his feet.
[79:57.86]The music matched really good when you were playing...
[80:02.15]Yeah.
[80:02.81]The stuff I was telling you too.
[80:06.08]Great when it lines up like that.
[80:12.16]I feel like having the timer in the corner would be too stressful for me.
[80:17.51]Because I'm like, wait a minute.
[80:18.41]It's been three minutes.
[80:19.31]I screwed up.
[80:23.18]Two minutes in the break room.
[80:24.50]Damn.
[80:27.02]That's pretty good.
[80:28.99]What is the golden disk?
[80:29.95]Spoiler?
[80:31.59]Spoilers.
[80:35.14]That was a nice one.
[80:48.63]I notice that you're not saving those and you just used it.
[80:53.64]Just used it?
[80:55.20]I feel like the rope thing is the rope rebar is amazing.
[80:59.17]I like I was saying to you earlier that was one of my least favorite rooms in the game because I just used it that's funny because I I don't love this room but I do not hate it I think it's just like yeah it's fine I think that giant bug room where you have to go all the way up up into the center that I think that is the worst room in period actually I know the one I'm saying is like not even hard and it's kind of simple I just
[81:26.90]You don't actually... It's a personal thing, man.
[81:30.02]I think the room that you're about to do here... No, no.
[81:31.62]You got... I actually don't like this one either.
[81:35.15]The one with the fan.
[81:35.93]When the fan turns on and off, it is horrible.
[81:37.93]That's this one.
[81:38.81]Yep.
[81:47.34]Okay.
[81:52.81]The confidence to do that and not... Wait, what?
[81:56.75]How did you not get your head cut off?
[81:59.09]Uh, once it stops, you can do it.
[82:01.65]Right when you press the button, you can just go?
[82:04.18]Yeah.
[82:04.60]I was always afraid that if I went, it was just going to chop my head off.
[82:07.16]Because it still moves pretty fast.
[82:08.02]It took me a long time to try that, to see that I wouldn't die.
[82:18.80]Did you get the grub?
[82:21.24]Uh, dude, no, I don't have time.
[82:24.98]Well, you're currently at Bowser's right now, so you better do something crazy.
[82:32.65]How much money do you have?
[82:33.37]How many money bugs do you have?
[82:35.45]31?
[82:39.70]I thought I had less than that.
[82:41.86]I'm surprised you don't.
[82:43.00]You only have 30?
[82:43.62]I thought you were going to have 100.
[82:44.96]I play hard mode, the other mode I was telling you, and it doesn't carry over.
[82:49.97]I see.
[82:51.36]And in that one you can't collect bugs.
[82:53.12]So I don't have a big stock of bugs.
[82:57.36]Is it full screen?
[82:59.39]I am full screen.
[83:00.07]You mean like press F11?
[83:03.47]To get her to the address bar?
[83:08.48]Alright, now this is great music.
[83:15.45]You are lining up like perfectly with it.
[83:34.99]11 doesn't work.
[83:37.02]It doesn't... It's like trying to do it, but it won't do it.
[83:39.28]That's weird.
[83:51.11]I'm not full screen?
[83:52.98]Wait, what the fuck?
[83:53.84]How was I not full screen?
[83:56.90]What is going on over there?
[83:59.78]I was... What?
[84:00.84]That's the first thing I...
[84:03.53]That's the first thing I clicked and... Bros.
[84:08.42]I swear.
[84:08.96]Now, this is actually great because now that there's not a very clear window order, people are going to think that I'm playing the game and people are going to be pissed that they showed up.
[84:29.70]That's good.
[84:31.04]Yeah.
[84:31.59]You're doing great, man.
[84:32.29]Holy shit, this run, Jeremy, you've gotten a lot better.
[84:34.26]I have gotten pretty good.
[84:36.22]Like, not that much better, but... Okay, I just see... I see how you're making this flower room just completely trivial by doing what you just did.
[84:44.05]Okay, I get it.
[84:44.83]Yep.
[84:51.21]So you just completely forget about the flower, just go up the side and just throw yourself up the edge.
[84:59.89]That climb always gives you two rebars too.
[85:02.58]They're pretty much always there.
[85:04.84]Oh man, it's rebar city, man.
[85:07.90]Hate this one.
[85:10.42]Don't like this one.
[85:19.50]Dude, Mario Galaxy might be like top 10 OSTs of all time, I think.
[85:25.66]I think that's accurate.
[85:31.92]So like right now, how fast I'm going in hard mode, I'd be worried about the goo.
[85:36.64]Really?
[85:37.04]It is.
[85:37.36]It is aggressive.
[85:40.85]That feels like you're going so unbelievably fast.
[85:50.94]It's just some of these longer sewer rooms that, like, can only be a certain distance behind you.
[85:56.81]I think it's different for hard mode than normal.
[85:59.44]Some of the long ones you can still... I think now, actually, no, this run is very fast.
[86:05.59]Those rooms just still make me nervous.
[86:08.28]You just, like, rocket jumped with the rebar.
[86:10.08]I thought people were lying when they said you could do that.
[86:13.05]You were in the beginning of your streams, like, shooting yourself backwards, launching yourself to death with it.
[86:18.07]I'm surprised that you're surprised.
[86:19.76]I guess I just didn't think it was going to be vertical motion.
[86:24.10]Oh.
[86:24.29]I don't know why I thought that it wasn't going to be vertical.
[86:29.17]It would be, like, I guess it would be whatever, right?
[86:33.46]Yeah.
[86:34.04]Whichever direction you're looking away from.
[86:55.49]I'm just imagining, like, a hot steam valve, like, blowing on, like, your bare feet.
[87:03.00]That would be fucking awful.
[87:05.14]Oh, he doesn't, oh, that, wait, that's spoilers.
[87:07.98]What is that?
[87:09.63]He doesn't, I don't know, I'm allowed to use this?
[87:17.26]Ooh.
[87:17.36]Alright, I want to see how he does this.
[87:23.04]Alright, you're doing some goofy shit right now.
[87:24.93]What is that?
[87:25.35]What's this goofy shit?
[87:26.17]Oh, you're taking my strategy?
[87:28.89]Uh, no, I realize I usually do this.
[87:33.58]I've been really bad at these too, man.
[87:35.32]Don't judge.
[87:36.20]You get it.
[87:46.95]Okay, good, good, good.
[87:51.49]It's a good elevator song.
[88:04.31]Bump.
[88:08.81]I'm gonna do that next time I try.
[88:09.93]Alright, how do you this is this this section I still it just gets me.
[88:19.32]Oh shit.
[88:23.02]what the was that you just skipped everything I'm gonna do that the next time I play how did you what you're gonna do the same thing oh my god dude it makes the whole entire section completely trivial you just what are you talking about
[88:46.86]oh my god you you also can just throw that one rebar in the beginning if you had it I would have told you to do it on that wall and it makes the back and forth super easy I'm crawling around hammering nails and you just have to rocket jump twice yep if you shoot it like actual
[89:10.66]horizontal behind you you don't have to grab the edges either I just am scared oh my god that's unbelievable that whole section is just bait the entire section this whole game kind of in a way a lot of stuff is I guess you're gonna call it bait that's unbelievable
[89:37.98]I usually don't perk at all, so I don't even know what the symbols.
[89:41.74]I'm just going to take the stamina.
[89:45.05]OK, so I will make this segment easier.
[89:47.19]I don't necessarily care about seeing this.
[89:49.93]But you've seen enough of this that I don't worry about spoiling it because you kind of got the mechanic.
[89:56.40]It's fine.
[89:56.82]Yeah, I don't.
[89:58.21]I'm into it.
[89:58.83]I'm curious.
[90:00.23]But when I get to the top of this, I'm not going to go any further.
[90:08.17]Are we actually going to see a first try beat the whole thing run?
[90:22.82]I don't have any fucking soup to drink.
[90:31.57]Somebody said this is pretty good feet music.
[90:34.80]It definitely is.
[90:36.55]This definitely is like, yeah, it is.
[91:04.21]Oh, my God, dude.
[91:06.16]What monster?
[91:06.99]We haven't even seen it.
[91:08.61]You've just blown through him.
[91:10.27]It has to catch me first.
[91:18.78]Uh-oh.
[91:18.94]You can just out-climb him.
[91:24.50]Like, if you have the adrenaline boost in this point, or the tonics to climb this area, it can go, like, you just sprint to the top.
[91:32.91]So when you start seeing those hands pop up, you just kind of screwed and they were gone.
[91:39.10]No, sometimes the hands will show up even if you've shot him with the flare or he's about to run away.
[91:43.34]It's a little spooky.
[91:46.30]That's so funny.
[91:46.88]The difference is, okay, this is just like the difference between somebody, like I played this, I played this like an old lady.
[91:53.33]I was like, well, hold on a second.
[91:55.19]I need to know where I'm going first.
[91:58.16]I can't just jump where I don't know.
[92:01.03]It's too bad this wasn't hard mode.
[92:04.01]Because this was a really good time for hard mode.
[92:06.71]If I didn't spend time taking perks, this was actually a good pace.
[92:10.29]Did you just beat it?
[92:12.62]Elevator's beaten, yeah.
[92:14.26]And then I don't think you deserve to see that area.
[92:18.46]What?
[92:22.83]That was crazy.
[92:23.95]I haven't earned it.
[92:27.91]Wow.
[92:28.59]The flare too is the same if you...
[92:32.85]Get flare jumps.
[92:34.01]1358?
[92:34.23]1357?
[92:34.92]Yeah.
[92:35.48]Somebody said, dude, he is way ahead of you.
[92:43.11]Yeah, by about 25,000 points.
[92:45.97]Alright, so what is hard mode?
[92:51.32]Can we see hard mode?
[92:52.31]I want to see hard mode.
[92:53.76]um hard is the same but the monsters are a little bit stronger you know like the tentacles you hate they are like like 10 times faster on the pole they really just grab you and murder you and I'm imagining endless is just you just endless does have like a a unique area to it when you loop there's like a whole different zone called the pier
[93:17.35]Um and hard mode and iron knuckle is just no saves.
[93:22.84]So it's roughly the same, just hard.
[93:24.16]Although I'll show you how fast the group goes in hard mode.
[93:27.82]I forget.
[93:28.20]Can you like?
[93:28.88]Do you like have hard mode enabled by default?
[93:31.72]I'm not even sure I have it unlocked.
[93:33.23]You probably have to beat it.
[93:35.59]Yeah, I think you have to beat it and then it shows hard mode.
[93:37.83]I'm just going to stand up here.
[93:40.51]And maybe we can get a view of the goo coming.
[93:44.24]Like is it already on the way?
[93:47.56]I think it still has a little bit of a delay from when you start, but the actual speed of it is probably twice as fast, if not more.
[93:57.13]Oh, so it's the actual, not necessarily the start time, but just how fast it actually climbs when it's in the room.
[94:04.84]Yeah.
[94:05.88]Like, do you see it coming up?
[94:06.94]Yeah.
[94:12.27]That is so much faster.
[94:15.60]that sucks wow that now seeing it have you jumping around yeah it's like two or three times faster and then yeah no uh wait no heart still has perks I don't know I usually play with the other one you have to have them like both turned on but that's that
[94:38.42]That's crazy.
[94:39.16]That's- that's the knock.
[94:40.32]Now you- now you know you can just jump the whole segment that you're dying on.
[94:43.60]Yeah.
[94:44.52]You can just jump the whole segment.
[94:47.43]Oh, and uh... And?
[94:53.79]What the hell?
[94:54.39]This thing can shoot at you?
[95:01.36]Does- that sucks.
[95:04.00]There's- there's some real shit.
[95:09.33]Are you going for one more crazy one?
[95:14.04]Do you want me to?
[95:15.48]Let's get a... Let's get a Ster.
[95:18.64]All on the mode he would normally play.
[95:21.77]In his most comfortable environment.
[95:24.23]Going crazy mode.
[95:26.01]In front of you.
[95:28.58]Yes.
[95:29.08]My most comfortable...
[95:30.80]Yeah, I want to see that, like, I'm going for, like, a good time.
[95:35.58]Not necessarily a PB, but, like... Well, I'm going to have to... If I'm on a good time, I'm going to have to pause at spoiler zone.
[95:42.91]No, you don't.
[95:43.39]It's fine.
[95:45.73]Do you think I'm really going to see that shit?
[95:48.20]I don't know.
[95:48.74]Are you going to play it again?
[95:49.62]I love the game.
[95:52.58]But, I don't know.
[95:53.56]I... Watching you fly around that Act 3 is, like, I don't know, man.
[95:59.43]Oh.
[95:59.72]It ruined it?
[96:00.84]No, no, no, no.
[96:01.55]It's just like, fuck, I got a long way to go.
[96:16.13]Dude, this guy's got red feet.
[96:23.82]Yeah, my doc says I need to take a break.
[96:29.49]I said you don't have to go Ster speed just to beat the game normally.
[96:32.57]No, that's true.
[96:33.23]That's true.
[96:36.66]Ster is, Ster is a gamer.
[96:39.74]That says Ster speed.
[96:41.02]He is the 249th best gamer.
[96:44.14]So that is, that is true.
[96:46.23]67 in this one.
[96:52.03]But I think I could, I think if I gamed a little bit more, if I kept going, but I'm waiting for the new stuff, which I keep saying, and then I still end up playing more.
[97:03.53]Oh, pretty good feet music.
[97:13.94]Oh.
[97:14.16]Oh, yeah.
[97:25.73]This is definitely more of a hand song.
[97:30.10]Maybe.
[97:35.76]Oh shit, 1 minute 50 into the break room.
[97:39.74]What the heck?
[97:44.71]Yeah.
[97:57.83]Who?
[98:00.15]That.
[98:02.94]Ah shit.
[98:07.97]I hate this place.
[98:20.31]I can't not go through that screaming.
[98:24.25]It's rough.
[98:30.84]It's rough for sure.
[98:38.48]Oh, brick.
[98:39.18]I missed brick.
[98:40.47]You got to get brick.
[98:42.31]You got it.
[98:42.97]You did it.
[98:51.95]There's no way you're going to beat the run without brick.
[98:55.16]I kind of hate these rooms.
[98:56.08]Like, I don't actually know what I'm doing.
[98:59.12]like freestyle it in these bigger ones like this it feels like it feels like a lot of these rooms just this shit just everywhere and you it just kind of like pick a direction and just hope you get up there because with all this the concrete jutting out of the sides it's just kind of like I guess go that way anything under four minutes here is uh giga
[99:29.31]really yeah I'm happy with that would that be a green split um that potentially gold whoa holy shit alright we're not sure oh no leaks detected my chat knows why
[99:59.43]what the intercom always says no leaks detected there so what is it what we say is a good time that it's like oh this is omega for act two to finish but for act two um if you're getting there when it says like eight minutes damn
[100:27.34]Little bit of a little bit of a hand goof.
[100:32.07]It's only one second, two second time lost, it's fine.
[100:36.07]That'll that'll be what bites him.
[100:54.31]And that is something I did not know was there.
[100:58.70]There's a lot of little things like that, but... Dude, five gifted.
[101:02.06]Thank you, HellCole, for the five gifted.
[101:04.68]They're going to kill me.
[101:06.09]Oh, my God.
[101:06.41]I almost died.
[101:08.51]Appreciate supporting the stream.
[101:11.55]HellCole coming in with five gifted.
[101:16.66]Yeah, thanks, HellCole.
[101:19.10]Five gifted.
[101:30.52]Hey, wait a minute.
[101:31.56]How do you handle this?
[101:34.17]I don't.
[101:34.95]I fucking die.
[101:44.36]Okay.
[101:46.76]Yeah, fuck this room.
[101:48.12]This one sucks.
[101:49.32]It's too big.
[101:54.21]You just got to do a little Wahoo.
[101:56.83]I tried to Wahoo one time and I died.
[102:00.31]A lot of times, some of the room layouts, they're just too far enough away that you'll bounce sideways is probably what you got.
[102:10.06]Another biggin'.
[102:14.81]Yeah, anytime you see this back-to-back, I go groan.
[102:18.11]This is a run killer for me almost every time.
[102:23.54]Alright, that was cool.
[102:25.42]That guy is usually not there.
[102:34.68]Oh, and you can see, yeah, down here, the goo's already here.
[102:38.35]I'm dead.
[102:40.15]I missed that one jump.
[102:43.71]Oh, that was going so good.
[102:45.37]Damn it.
[102:46.72]Yeah.
[102:48.34]And then you get caught in the loop, and it just says restart, and you're like, well, I guess I'm playing white knuckle.
[102:53.48]Hey, by the way, that was that stupid freaking lip part, and I saw that you got a little caught on that lip.
[103:01.89]I don't think I did.
[103:03.20]I made it up just to give myself more confidence in everything I say.
[103:10.15]Oh, you do need that.
[103:11.43]I was trying to inception that into your head.
[103:12.95]So you were like, wait a minute, that lip was there.
[103:14.57]And like, you know what?
[103:15.13]Like, fuck that lip.
[103:16.79]Well, I agreed with you on the lip.
[103:18.36]I like psychically got that you were talking about the lip the first time because I used to get stuck on that lip all of the time.
[103:24.62]Yeah.
[103:29.47]These are real things.
[103:33.36]Chat might think you're crazy, but you're not crazy.
[103:45.94]So do you ever just do bug runs where you try to collect money or are you just going super fast mode and you don't really care about money?
[103:52.00]Like I was saying, you can't use bugs in this mode.
[103:53.88]So sometimes if I see a diamond bug in this one, I'll grab them.
[103:58.23]But that's usually it because I don't play normal a lot.
[104:01.69]Does diamond do something different that's not just five coins?
[104:05.40]no they give five coins that's why because there's a lot of things that are like seven coins so if I see a diamond one then it's like oh I should oh I see he's got me oh my hammer's in the wrong hand I usually go I'm usually a left hander you know I think that's another bro strategy that makes total sense because left click is a fun room
[104:29.62]I got to do that from now on.
[104:31.82]Left click is attack, right?
[104:33.86]I saw some people saying you're the only one anyone has ever seen use hammer right hand.
[104:37.89]And I was like, you know what?
[104:38.99]That's weird.
[104:39.91]Why am I doing that?
[104:41.65]True.
[104:43.23]You know, it's fine to be on the right.
[104:45.65]But maybe I'm so used to doing that now that it would mess me up if I did it the other way now.
[104:51.76]Whoa.
[104:54.16]That's how strong their grab force is on hard, though.
[104:56.78]Holy shit.
[104:57.22]It takes a lot longer to do on normal.
[105:17.76]I actually kind of like this one.
[105:19.10]This is like one of my favorite rooms.
[105:21.19]I just like how things are weirdly spread out and you have to go to jump from panel to panel.
[105:25.47]It's fun.
[105:34.70]It's a fun one.
[105:38.81]This is nap music.
[105:41.99]This is spooky music, isn't it?
[105:56.68]so yeah I I was saying uh when I opened this game for the first time I did the tutorial where you have to climb with the pittance and I told chat I'm not going to be able to do this I said this is awful I I closed the game and stopped and I said I'm going to prove to you that I can't do this by opening up qwop that old game oh yeah it seems like qwop because the controls were like they didn't make sense to me
[106:21.63]But then I heard the knuckle call and I said, you know what?
[106:26.32]I gotta give it another chance.
[106:27.94]So you didn't give up in the tutorial?
[106:30.37]No.
[106:30.97]That's a plus.
[106:31.31]Well, because you, I mean, you told me.
[106:32.87]You said you, before I, okay, for all that don't know, before I installed the game, I said, I'm going to do this today.
[106:40.34]Ster said, please play this, but you have to promise me something.
[106:44.97]I was like, what is it?
[106:46.23]That you have to promise that you give it at least a full hour.
[106:50.38]You have to.
[106:50.92]You have to.
[106:51.54]Even if you hate it.
[106:53.68]You have to.
[106:55.57]I said, okay, fine.
[106:56.99]You have to get through it.
[106:59.23]And I will say that tutorial area when I... You think that the grabbing and letting go mechanic is going to be way more annoying than it actually is.
[107:09.61]Oh, it was the inventory management that made no sense that it was just hard to manage.
[107:15.10]Like, how am I supposed to climb this wall and pick this out and take that out and hammer that?
[107:18.61]Which you don't even end up doing a lot in the game for quite a while.
[107:21.56]Not really.
[107:21.90]So it was just like, it's quite overwhelming in the beginning.
[107:26.92]Yeah, even in the first few rooms too, when I realized that this was going to be... Oh, it's one of these hard games.
[107:33.19]Oh, okay.
[107:33.71]Oh, it's one of those hard games.
[107:35.95]I didn't think I was going to really like it that much.
[107:37.41]I thought it was going to be fun.
[107:39.19]Like, think of the other games that are in this category, right?
[107:42.50]Like, oh, you know, like the body type games, right?
[107:45.34]Like, oh, getting over it.
[107:46.36]You got to... Don't fall down.
[107:47.80]You're going to fucking lose.
[107:49.53]Jump King.
[107:50.11]You fell down.
[107:50.87]Back to... Yo, back down to the first area.
[107:52.91]You suck.
[107:54.57]Um...
[107:56.12]It's really not like that, other than the restarting, but it... It's in the same kind of... I don't really like any of those games.
[108:06.65]I sometimes get brought on board to play them.
[108:10.17]Jump King was fun.
[108:11.71]No!
[108:13.79]Good save.
[108:15.19]Oh, he's good.
[108:16.68]He's alright.
[108:19.34]I thought Jump King was fun.
[108:20.22]Jump King was fun.
[108:20.80]I definitely wouldn't do the DLC, though.
[108:22.42]I mean, maybe.
[108:24.04]Maybe.
[108:24.28]Maybe.
[108:25.87]I'm surprised I beat Chain Together.
[108:28.22]I haven't even played that one.
[108:31.30]I've seen people play it.
[108:32.04]It looked crazy.
[108:41.48]I feel like I'm in way more control in this game.
[108:43.76]Like, Jump King was fun, but Jump King really did feel like the difference between holding the jump button down for a quarter of a tenth of a second versus a quarter of a fifth of a second was just a lot more jump.
[109:00.75]So you had to really kind of compensate for it.
[109:04.44]This, I actually feel like I'm in total control.
[109:07.60]yeah because there's no there's no charge meter on the you know like oh hold the jump button down here is your charge meter you kind of have to get the muscle memory perfect in your brain which is kind of hard to do there's no bug saving or saving like that no between run progress and a Jump King you said it's one grab away from death
[109:33.67]Yeah, but I mean, I'm talking about like the game's control mechanics.
[109:36.61]Like I feel like I'm in total control whether or not I lose or not.
[109:40.12]And the game is very punishing.
[109:41.34]If you fall, a lot of times you can just be dead.
[109:44.16]But actually playing the video game, like what he's doing right now, I feel like out of all these games, this one is the one I feel like the most totally, completely one-to-one.
[109:54.28]Okay, remember when the Wiimote came out and it was a huge deal because it was like, wait a minute, it's one-to-one on the screen.
[110:00.47]I can move it and it's there and I can see it.
[110:03.57]The crosshair?
[110:04.33]And it's my real hair?
[110:05.78]That's my real hair on the screen?
[110:07.88]The Wiimote?
[110:08.54]The crosshair is just 60 FPS.
[110:11.38]I can see it.
[110:17.17]It kind of feels like that.
[110:24.98]The goo is right below me.
[110:25.96]I'm hearing the noise.
[110:26.97]Oh, God.
[110:28.81]But you can see how fast I went, right?
[110:31.75]That was, yeah, it was crazy.
[110:36.67]I am... I'm... I felt like once... Well, because a lot of games like this, you... Sometimes you'll go to jump and grab, and... Oh, it didn't click.
[110:47.44]I didn't stick on that one.
[110:49.22]Oh, the game fucked up.
[110:50.42]The game's, like, collision detection was wrong.
[110:54.02]I don't think there's ever been a point where I went to grab something, and grabbed it, or didn't grab it, and it felt like the collision was wrong.
[111:00.99]It's like the smoothest, most butteriest jumping game I think I've ever played.
[111:05.11]And I've played four.
[111:07.77]So, okay.
[111:10.61]I believe you.
[111:12.43]You sound like an expert.
[111:19.48]Try Celeste.
[111:20.56]I beat Celeste.
[111:22.21]Celeste is great.
[111:27.17]It's kind of a different... Kind of like a...
[111:30.87]On an unrelated note.
[111:32.77]Celeste is more Meat Boy.
[111:35.81]I'd say Meat Boy is in that Celeste category.
[111:40.22]Meat Boy is great too.
[111:42.22]I feel like going back to Meat Boy, I wonder how hard I would think Meat Boy is now after all these crazy games that come out that are just like, the game is fucking crazy and you gotta do it in one go and it's hard.
[111:53.54]I wonder if it would be still great.
[111:56.18]I fell behind.
[111:57.22]Daigu was coming.
[111:58.31]I didn't need to do that but I thought I would.
[112:02.04]and then he goes again you're gonna go again I could go I I could go all night you know what they say yeah I think I'm gonna play this game called dream core in a few minutes or not a few minutes and like after you do this uh this will be last one then it looks pretty weird
[112:27.74]I would like to get to the end or... I don't know if you don't... I can't imagine you... I feel like you feel relieved that you're not playing anymore.
[112:37.46]I mean, it's... I feel like I'm living vicariously through you and how well you're doing, but I'm... I think what I'm noticing is...
[112:45.74]You are doing such a great job that I'm just like, damn, I'm not processing much of like gameplay tech wise.
[112:54.81]I'm just kind of here going, holy shit, he's fucking, he's going, he's smoking up there.
[113:02.62]Oh my fucking God, not that room.
[113:06.63]Oh my, what are you supposed to do?
[113:07.81]Uh, I need to come up behind the one that I showed up next to.
[113:13.74]I didn't see I didn't hear them beeping or see their lasers at all so I didn't know they were there they're not always there honestly what I'll tell you the one great thing about watching you do this has been to learn that I can skip that entire section that's the confidence booster you need it that's the confidence boost I needed to at least reliably get to act three
[113:38.73]you um with the items and everything you do not even need to call the elevator at the bottom like the uh the super normal mode speed runs I I'm not sure that they do really yep because you can get like the grub that can climb walls you get the adrenaline you get the tonic and you can just like sprint up the walls uh not long but you can get multiple to like chain together
[114:10.99]I was gonna say something else oh there's like a hatch at the top the elevator doesn't need to open the thing at the top you can like open a hatch and climb out oh my god he's gonna do it guys he's gonna get up to the top
[114:40.29]That's what's fun too.
[114:41.91]It's a very dense game more than it looks of a lot of stuff you can find out to do.
[114:49.38]There's still new routes and new things I'm seeing in rooms, which is why I like watching so much.
[114:54.57]One of the reasons.
[114:59.05]Definitely really cool.
[115:00.56]I'm so curious about how much more they add.
[115:06.62]What's the roadmap today?
[115:07.55]Are they
[115:09.15]there is a roadmap out soon we're getting like trial rooms like I'm not exactly sure on that what's going on we're getting I should have pressed this button uh but I think I think Chad had me second guessing that I thought it was act three is the end of the game and there's supposed to be seven
[115:39.40]but they were saying like the other one was ac- I don't know and I'd only ever heard that in your chat so it's probably made up I'm gonna have to have a fucking protein shake before doing getting all the way through act six and get to act seven and be like ready to go oh my god I I hate this spot I there has to be something else I'm missing in that spot where you don't have to use an item
[116:15.80]It's going to be a big update this month or next month.
[116:24.06]I'm down.
[116:24.87]Holy shit, that looks awful.
[116:28.72]On hard, they're really so brutal.
[116:46.09]I've gotten like no rebars or anything this one though.
[116:49.38]Yeah, you need to take pre-workout to play this game all the way through Act 7.
[116:56.07]I'm curious how long it actually will be.
[116:58.87]The whole thing is what?
[116:59.59]To get some of the best runs are what?
[117:01.54]15, 20 minutes?
[117:05.70]That might be like 30 plus minutes for 40 plus minutes to get the whole thing done in like a crazy super fast way.
[117:28.75]Bad place for that bug to be.
[117:37.66]Uh, does the goop have a catch-up mechanic?
[117:39.93]Or is it just a single speed?
[117:41.23]I was wondering that too.
[117:43.55]Um, it has a catch-up mechanic.
[117:45.91]Well, it can only ever be so far behind.
[117:50.00]It's actually right behind me right now.
[117:51.38]Like, it was right there.
[117:52.36]Because I've gotten a couple of these rooms that are physically impossible to do quick because you're going through vents.
[117:59.38]But if you're doing really well, will it just kind of teleport into a spot behind you?
[118:04.29]I think it's hard to remember.
[118:05.89]I think in normal mode, it's five minutes that it will be behind.
[118:08.73]But if you're faster than that, it'll like the max distance it could be is five minutes away.
[118:13.54]I see.
[118:13.98]So, yeah, I guess that answers that question.
[118:16.10]So you can only one minute in hard.
[118:19.07]You can only be five minutes ahead of it.
[118:21.83]Yeah.
[118:22.69]Damn.
[118:26.90]Do not cite this source in your homework.
[118:32.33]Yeah, Ster is not a game developer of this game.
[118:34.99]He is just a guy that plays it very well.
[118:38.16]I'm just, I'm Jerma's friend.
[118:42.24]Check my Wikipedia page.
[118:44.49]Hey, check out the stream at Ster.
[118:50.96]Hey, I'm watching him right now.
[118:53.38]I've got this stream open right now.
[118:55.76]found it the other day it's twitch.tv Ster I'm watching it right now and I liked it so much I invited him on my stream today and now we're yeah he's just look at he's playing the game really well for us you gotta let those bugs get like stuck on a wall so you can just smash so you kind of let them like even fly under you or to the to a wall next to you a little bit
[119:32.51]There's one following me.
[119:39.76]It followed me through that whole vent.
[119:41.90]He's right behind me.
[119:43.74]Oh, boy.
[119:44.08]This is, um... Did you ever play Mario Odyssey?
[119:51.67]Uh, I don't think... The Moons?
[119:54.19]No, uh, no.
[119:55.49]It's pretty good.
[119:57.40]Reminds me of the bug.
[119:58.10]Oh, no, I'm good.
[119:59.34]Oh!
[120:01.76]Goddamn, dude.
[120:03.02]I'm usually a one can I get can I get one more and I'm gonna play a little bit a little I just want to you know Zone three type beat.
[120:13.22]Okay, I could even do it on normal and go quicker Let me hit him with a normal you got you got ten minutes to beat the whole game, okay, you gave me ten minutes I
[120:30.18]You got to beat the whole game in 10 minutes.
[120:35.20]Two minutes.
[120:37.46]I can beat you in two minutes.
[120:39.76]Who says that?
[120:40.36]Which gaming character says that line?
[120:43.35]I can beat you in two minutes.
[120:52.93]I don't know.
[120:55.10]You'd never guess that.
[120:57.04]It's such an obscure thing that I referenced still for some reason.
[120:59.40]I think it's
[121:01.56]I want to get this room.
[121:02.41]This room looks fun.
[121:04.97]Fang and Street Fighter.
[121:06.08]I can't remember which Street Fighter.
[121:11.31]I know that one.
[121:12.17]I know.
[121:12.45]Seven minutes.
[121:13.81]Seven minutes is all I need to destroy you.
[121:23.94]Dude, a Resident Evil 5 co-op stream?
[121:28.32]Play it co-op for like the 10th time?
[121:30.69]On different platforms, on different videos?
[121:34.81]I think I've played that on a video or been in somebody else's video like five different times now.
[121:41.62]Hey.
[121:41.96]Wait, like... Let's do it again.
[121:43.84]Just keep doing the same fucking content.
[121:46.06]Who gives a shit?
[121:49.30]You know what that means.
[121:51.29]I mean...
[121:52.59]here I am playing white knuckle again well I feel like the game came out like 20 years ago what what 15 years ago oh this game white knuckle 20 years from now is going to hit so hard bring out the reruns yeah 20 years ago this is what video games looked like
[122:24.50]Let's get Ocarina of Time.
[122:26.35]Are you not going to do it?
[122:28.43]Oh, he's not going to do it.
[122:42.36]Okay, I see that you got those drugs there.
[122:45.03]Yeah.
[122:46.05]There are drugs, and then there's the drink.
[122:52.55]what is the difference between the two of them the drugs make you they give you climbing speed and movement speed and the drink makes you not run out of stamina okay the drugs do not give stamina no okay good no your hands are still get they'll get still get tired because I think I've taken them in the thought that that was I had stamina uh this I uh
[123:22.79]Whatever.
[123:23.61]We're just... We're getting it done.
[123:28.96]You got seven minutes.
[123:36.75]I never go this way.
[123:38.65]You always go this way.
[123:39.52]Where are the handholds, man?
[123:40.84]There aren't any.
[123:42.16]You gotta throw something.
[123:47.33]I literally never go this way.
[123:52.56]okay um oh shit what the hell was that what's that you just shot like a laser beam and teleported that was so crazy just make me gonna sneeze I got like no items
[124:24.97]that even come through yeah yeah I heard it maybe they didn't I think you're I hear more of what you say because all the cameras I have uh honestly it oh he's screwed he's he's going for the climb he's going for the climb even in act one whoa that actually is amazing that lasted way longer than I thought it was going to last
[124:56.58]It wouldn't have lasted too much longer than that there.
[125:00.09]So you can effectively skip an entire room.
[125:02.03]It's like one whole room.
[125:04.35]If you go fast enough.
[125:05.08]Depending on the zones you use it in, but yeah, you'll get a room out of it.
[125:08.52]But if you have the adrenaline when you do it, so your climb speed's higher, then you can, like, you can make a lot of time.
[125:15.35]Alright, you got five minutes.
[125:16.81]So you do tonic, grub, adrenaline, and then you sprint.
[125:22.30]Damn.
[125:24.56]You got five minutes.
[125:26.62]Clock is ticking.
[125:32.69]Don't say that.
[125:35.52]You gotta do it to the chicken song.
[125:42.99]Holding grubs with the feet.
[125:44.71]I crushed that living creature in between my toes.
[125:54.50]Okay, now this is the first time I actually got some climbing speed.
[126:11.38]You're going.
[126:17.42]You're actually going.
[126:22.93]Guys, I think he's going to do it.
[126:49.78]Why can't your gameplay look like this?
[126:54.38]What do you think is going on right now?
[126:57.15]Jeremy, you got so much better.
[127:02.14]Holy shit, Jeremy.
[127:02.88]I didn't watch for one day and... That looked like you just double jumped.
[127:10.59]I can't even begin to understand what happened there.
[127:13.81]Wahoo!
[127:15.47]The eyeball does... It is like a Dishonored teleport...
[127:21.74]So maybe you saw me eyeball again.
[127:57.92]I'm all sure I can.
[127:59.12]I can sense myself doing drama camera right there.
[128:04.20]Come on, get it together man.
[128:08.51]No cans.
[128:19.28]hate that little lip now that's the little lip we what we got to talk about this tiny little thing headbutt you headbutt it and it shoots you off now that's one we got to talk about that happened to me before and I am just as angry as you are I usually try and like make sure I take um you know the micro step forward but not while my hero's watching do I want to slow down you're so brave for what you did
[128:49.52]How many times can you use this teleport bug?
[128:51.69]That's crazy.
[128:52.81]Have you used it like three times?
[128:54.17]I, I, I, you can use it three times.
[128:56.79]I haven't been using it.
[128:58.98]Oh my God.
[129:01.94]Oh.
[129:04.09]Oh bib.
[129:04.73]Good thing he got wedged in the place where you can get wedged.
[129:08.05]That's a different spot.
[129:09.45]Well, whatever.
[129:18.80]hands tired feet my feet are killing me I just climbed to work today alright but I want to see this again I want to make sure I look exactly where you are and exactly what you do they even give you two rebars to do it man yep this game they even give you two rebars to do it the the jump on the second one where I jumped across there's like a 50 50 there's a rebar on the other side too
[129:49.28]So what I like to do in this zone is I look for number three, and then I line it up horizontally and wait until the elevator brings me above it.
[130:00.13]Uh-huh.
[130:04.34]Looks like you did it right when it landed on the... I missed that one.
[130:09.27]I was going to go touch it.
[130:11.57]I missed that one bad.
[130:14.40]Oh, yeah.
[130:14.74]Omega Lull.
[130:15.72]Omega Lull.
[130:16.34]He dropped.
[130:16.94]He didn't do it.
[130:17.50]Omega Lull.
[130:19.45]Stop, there's too many omega lols.
[130:21.67]That's the easiest one and he didn't do it.
[130:24.44]Omega LOL.
[130:27.42]I'm nervous.
[130:30.58]I've never played this game before.
[130:32.19]No, stop.
[130:38.11]This doesn't represent me.
[130:40.78]Dude, there's a 12, 15 streak, a 20 streak omega LOL.
[130:46.56]18.
[130:52.93]So you can just teleport over the whole thing?
[130:58.66]Uh, yeah, but you could... Okay, you get that eye by beating the endless mode.
[131:02.20]What the fuck, man?
[131:03.53]That's even more ridiculous.
[131:06.05]So you're not going to have that eye unless you've beaten... I think you might have to loop twice in endless or just once, I think.
[131:10.94]How much harder is endless mode than the base game?
[131:14.24]It is the base game, but then you get to the end and it loops.
[131:17.91]Oh.
[131:18.73]It's just another different mode.
[131:19.93]There's a couple different... There's like five endless variations.
[131:22.43]So do you have to... To get that item, do you have to beat the game twice in a row?
[131:27.15]Or do you just have to get the end of it once?
[131:28.99]I think it's the end of it twice.
[131:32.24]Oh my god.
[131:33.00]I can't remember, but then you have to use the eye twice in order... Yeah, because you have to use the... I don't know.
[131:37.28]You have to use the eye twice for it to show up in vendors.
[131:40.62]I'm forgetting.
[131:41.12]I feel like that's such a good item that I want to be able to get that as a fucking noob.
[131:50.39]Well, then you're going to have to go to the pier.
[131:58.20]It also lets you get into a secret level that has its own lore and whatnot going on.
[132:07.11]Hint.
[132:08.75]Any achievement hunters out there?
[132:10.54]Just reach the secret endless mode area once to get the eye.
[132:26.23]Oh, also, I see everybody do this.
[132:28.09]You do not have to take a flare into your hand to reload the flare gun when you were playing.
[132:32.88]The flare will just reload if it's in your inventory.
[132:35.42]What?
[132:37.55]So you shoot a flare, put it back in the inventory as long as there is one.
[132:40.75]You just click the flare again and it reloads if you have a flare.
[132:44.46]Oh, shit.
[132:47.74]Alright, well, let's see it.
[132:56.71]Good song to go, uh, to do it on.
[133:22.61]This is like asking your big brother to beat a level for you.
[133:25.34]Beat a game for you.
[133:26.58]No, this is like asking God to grace him with your presence for a few minutes.
[133:31.49]Please.
[133:34.13]This is like getting your prayer answered.
[133:37.47]Like you're praying and all of a sudden a light shines through your window.
[133:42.60]It's like, yes, I have answered your call.
[133:46.37]What would you like?
[133:47.93]How about me beat White Knuckle for you?
[133:53.24]Because that's what it takes.
[133:58.63]Why would God suggest that?
[134:01.83]He must really want to show it off.
[134:03.93]Would you like me to?
[134:05.08]I'm a huge fan right now.
[134:07.68]Would you like to see my run?
[134:09.60]Whatever your prayer is.
[134:11.44]Your prayers, I don't need to hear them.
[134:13.41]I know you want to see White Knuckle be beat in 15 minutes.
[134:23.75]Dude, how you gonna?
[134:24.95]Wow.
[134:27.36]That was a nail-biter.
[134:28.78]Do you want to see the rest?
[134:34.83]I do.
[134:35.49]Go.
[134:36.87]We want to see it.
[134:38.71]You're on 14 minutes here.
[134:40.51]You're on pace.
[134:44.46]I guess I'll take... I thought those... What?
[134:51.58]cool it's like a big bunch of bricks and shipping containers kind of like a outdoor house area I actually would have probably loved this area that's what I'm hoping you got to because it's like a bunch of houses no there's a lot to explore there's a lot there's like another variation that has some like some secrets in here they usually go in the first one I feel like this should be the first level
[135:22.05]Oh, he doesn't want to have to work for it.
[135:25.80]Well, then I'll get really sad if I accidentally fall.
[135:28.42]What?
[135:29.83]This place looks amazing.
[135:34.01]You can actually fall most of the way down this and not die.
[135:38.00]There's no fall damage, really, is there?
[135:40.67]There is a limit, but it's gigantic.
[135:46.03]Dude, I'm not going to remember even half of the things I'm seeing right now.
[135:48.40]It's just all I saw was brick houses and it's outside and you can grab a lot of stuff.
[135:57.25]Did you do it?
[135:58.81]Yeah, that area is like just super chill.
[136:01.39]That's where like the adrenaline deload.
[136:04.41]The detox.
[136:05.26]This is the end of the early access.
[136:08.16]This is the final zone.
[136:09.70]There's still like another area.
[136:11.80]Oh my God, there's another one.
[136:15.50]this would technically be like act four or five this this is all part of three as far as I understand it um and if you die here you do go back to like like act two the elevator shaft not act two you the the room before that with the oh right but it it was daunting to have to do the uh scary monster man twice
[136:42.45]And this area has a secret monster of its own.
[136:45.61]Dude, I'm going to freak out if I ever get to Act 3 again.
[136:48.80]And, like, the monster goes, I'm going to just jump off the edge.
[136:52.04]Like, it happens every time.
[137:00.66]A silo?
[137:02.52]Because you have the sound off, there are turrets shooting you on both sides of this.
[137:06.14]Well, that sounds awful.
[137:10.22]Is the strategy with this one just to go with just fly up there and don't even just go?
[137:14.85]Or you can like watch where the turrets are and like rotate around the cylinder in the middle.
[137:23.30]If you're taking your time.
[137:25.38]You can kind of chill on the top of the cylinders.
[137:28.04]This looks ridiculous.
[137:31.14]Oh, I'm not getting the.
[137:35.17]The rooms you normally get.
[137:37.05]Monster sucks asshole.
[137:39.44]It's baffling to make a great climbing game with a dog shit mechanic like that laughing my ass off.
[137:46.12]I mean, you could just get good.
[137:49.51]I don't have an opinion.
[137:52.33]Look, fast forward like two or three weeks when I get there and I say exactly what you just said, right?
[137:57.45]Like I'm going to lose to that monster like 10 times and I'm probably going to repeat what you said, right?
[138:02.36]But I'm not, but right now I have no opinion.
[138:04.16]You will, you will.
[138:07.78]Like, I was playing the game a lot and did the area and beat the game and gone through there and was kind of sort of speedrunning.
[138:16.76]And that area still for the longest time was absolutely stressing me out.
[138:23.57]What the hell's going on?
[138:25.41]Don't mind me.
[138:25.97]I got got.
[138:28.73]What?
[138:29.82]What happened?
[138:30.48]What's happening to you?
[138:33.14]You're holding your own hand up.
[138:35.91]No, that is a hand grabbing my face and trying to pull me to my death.
[138:40.66]But it looks like you're kind of trying not to puke and sitting down and like sliding your ass on stuff.
[138:47.15]Yeah.
[138:52.52]So this area is tricky.
[138:55.30]I don't know if you want me to explain it or how much you want to hear.
[138:58.84]I mean, dude, it would be a Christmas miracle if I got where you are standing right now in the next three months.
[139:06.32]So there's all these tunnels where... Oh, I turned and now I lost my way.
[139:11.87]You see the hands.
[139:12.73]If you look at the hand, they're like a Slenderman and they go away.
[139:16.59]Kind of thing.
[139:17.89]Or, I don't know, whatever.
[139:19.01]Enderman?
[139:19.55]Oh my god.
[139:21.04]So you have to, like, a lot of these places, like, check your back.
[139:24.62]And you can hear them growling at you the whole way.
[139:27.50]To see how close they are.
[139:28.48]Like, there was one right there.
[139:32.45]One frame.
[139:34.15]You catch him.
[139:35.67]There he was.
[139:42.70]This is crazy.
[139:43.53]2200 meters
[140:11.11]Did you do it?
[140:12.93]He did it!
[140:16.59]Dude, look at me up there!
[140:17.53]28,000!
[140:19.68]I'm up there!
[140:21.06]Holy shit!
[140:22.60]You're doing it!
[140:23.94]Shit, Poke has 1,100?
[140:24.94]Yeah, you beat someone who opened the game and immediately closed it.
[140:32.27]Presumably.
[140:33.43]With 42 points.
[140:34.96]Oh, I thought you meant Poke did that.
[140:36.44]I was like, how the fuck did he do that?
[140:42.91]Has Poke beaten it?
[140:45.10]No.
[140:46.14]Has Poke gotten to Act 3?
[140:47.68]I think you'll get like 2500 at least if you're beating it.
[140:50.55]Did Poke get to Act 3?
[140:53.01]He said he played again recently.
[140:54.35]I don't know how far he got.
[140:55.77]I have to watch that.
[140:58.86]He's hooked.
[141:00.56]How come you're not friends with Poke?
[141:01.58]He's in my chat.
[141:02.62]Act 2 end, I think.
[141:04.12]Act 2 end.
[141:04.63]Is what he said.
[141:05.47]Okay.
[141:05.79]Like past the elevator shaft?
[141:07.37]Past the elevator segment or no?
[141:08.81]No.
[141:11.64]Did you get to the big shaft with the flare gun?
[141:16.16]He said he died at the elevator.
[141:18.22]Yeah, dude.
[141:18.71]That's the pay.
[141:19.97]If you probably have been watching, if you have been watching poke, did you see that fucking strategy?
[141:24.19]You can't tell people that you have to suffer.
[141:28.28]Suffer as I have.
[141:29.82]I suffered.
[141:30.66]I think I've suffered.
[141:32.00]I suffered doing that.
[141:33.75]I mean, poke.
[141:36.31]I don't want to see... I'm too literal.
[141:42.60]One simple typo, he's gone.
[141:44.84]I don't want to see somebody suffer.
[141:47.89]I had to suffer with that, and I know that he's like, oh shit, that part's really difficult and really sucks.
[141:54.76]I'm going to be doing it the other strat.
[142:01.93]I'm doing it the other way.
[142:05.06]uh well it's a really great game um yeah no you have to watch thank you for for hosting the Ster watch party I'm glad you enjoyed the game it's been fun watching you uh but if you're gonna play Dracula or something I I bid you uh unfortunately dude Dracula 3 sucks I'm it was bad we we kind of it was not good
[142:32.15]We're going to drink a bunch of fucking beers and play it on Sunday.
[142:36.50]Well, I'm going to drink like three.
[142:40.83]Three beers?
[142:42.60]I plan on drinking like three beers on Sunday and we're going to get through it.
[142:47.20]What are you doing now?
[142:49.98]I was going to play this game called Dream.
[142:54.39]Dream Core.
[142:55.42]Been in my Steam library for a million years.
[142:57.62]I think it's just like a quick little thing.
[142:59.58]I was going to play for like a half an hour.
[143:01.37]Yeah, I think I know that one.
