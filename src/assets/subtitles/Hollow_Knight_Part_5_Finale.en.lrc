[01:06.45]How are we?
[01:08.61]Good afternoon.
[01:09.45]That's not even the afternoon.
[01:12.01]It's not the afternoon.
[01:15.68]It's very much in the night time.
[01:17.78]Very much so.
[01:18.84]Very much.
[01:22.18]Very much so.
[01:24.48]My sleep schedule is more fucked than yours and that's saying something.
[01:27.25]I know.
[01:28.61]This is what happens.
[01:31.06]What happens when I... Anytime I go to... We'll wait for people to trickle in so I can tell you this.
[01:36.19]This is how it happens every time.
[01:39.39]Just the way it is.
[01:42.67]Make that tweet.
[01:44.61]Put that over there.
[01:45.21]Move that out of the way.
[01:54.74]But, yes, hello.
[01:56.86]It's 2 a.m.
[01:57.52]there.
[01:59.10]Hey, you want to start a live stream?
[02:00.86]Like start the stream at like 2 a.m.
[02:02.98]this time?
[02:05.41]Yeah, we're going to do more Hollow Knight.
[02:07.69]Just a little bit more.
[02:09.33]We'll see when I get to the end of tonight's stream.
[02:12.79]We'll see if I'm going to do this again.
[02:16.61]Dark Souls 3 absolutely is on Tuesday.
[02:18.84]Dark Souls 3's DLC comes out on Tuesday.
[02:22.36]I believe the patch is already available, but I think it just adds a PvP zone.
[02:27.22]You can't play the new area, I don't think, yet.
[02:30.76]So Tuesday, when it all fully unlocks, we're doing Dark Souls 3 DLC.
[02:36.87]I'm going to pick up pretty much with the same character, I would assume, unless it's in a weird spot.
[02:41.49]I'm going to have to do some research on that.
[02:46.95]But it's all good.
[02:52.09]Am I going to play any more GTA Online?
[02:53.91]GTA is one of those games where I can just do it anytime I want.
[02:59.51]Don't really have to plan for it.
[03:04.53]Let me switch over.
[03:07.09]There it is.
[03:09.99]Hollow Knight.
[03:11.69]Change this a little.
[03:13.14]Hey, there it is.
[03:14.18]Look at that.
[03:18.96]Yeah, we might put a cap on Hollow Knight tonight.
[03:22.06]And then I might just kind of finish the rest off stream.
[03:25.64]We'll see how you guys feel.
[03:26.38]Because I have been playing this game on stream quite a bit recently.
[03:30.72]The last, like, two weeks have been pretty much Hollow Knight.
[03:34.82]And some other random things.
[03:37.76]So we might put a cap on this tonight.
[03:39.57]We'll see.
[03:43.05]And then I can, you know, continue to play it off stream and...
[03:47.18]Do it on my own time, as they say.
[03:49.12]Because obviously Dark Souls 3's DLC is a lot more important to me than playing Hollow Knight on Tuesday.
[03:59.29]And I did listen to the new Guerrilla songs.
[04:01.57]The new Guerrilla's album is launching on the 28th of April.
[04:08.49]And I got some opinions on it.
[04:11.79]I think Saturn Bars is a fantastic track.
[04:14.98]Saturn Bars is really good.
[04:16.98]If I'm going to rate these songs, Saturn Bars is like the song that they actually wanted to release.
[04:23.72]Andromeda is... is always good.
[04:27.65]It kind of reminds me of their old stuff, like the first album.
[04:31.49]So I like... Saturn Bars, good.
[04:33.61]Andromeda, good.
[04:35.23]Like, good.
[04:36.07]Like, kind of good.
[04:38.48]And the other two songs I feel like are just like filler songs.
[04:42.39]They're good.
[04:42.79]They're not great, but they're kind of just there.
[04:46.31]I wasn't like a huge fan of... One of them is like two minutes long and it's kind of just like a... It's kind of like a college football chant.
[04:57.92]So yeah, I'd say Andromeda and Saturn Bars are the two good songs.
[05:01.51]The ones that I actually like.
[05:04.16]And the other ones are... Especially the We Have The Power one is sort of just like a chant.
[05:08.48]It's not necessarily really like a song.
[05:12.16]But... Listening to Andromeda takes me back to the first album.
[05:16.53]And I love that.
[05:23.31]You like Dissension?
[05:24.35]Yeah, they're good.
[05:25.77]Look, I think they're all good.
[05:29.69]But until I hear the whole album... You kind of need the whole album...
[05:35.84]There's gonna be like 26 tracks on the album You didn't like Saturn bars the auto-tuned all my life voice bugged you Yeah, I just like Damon Albarn's part in that song.
[05:50.41]It's like it reminds me of like Demon Days His kind of wailing I guess you could say the way that he sings Yeah, I guess there's gonna be like 26 songs on that album apparently
[06:04.73]But like half of those songs I think are just interludes.
[06:09.01]I don't think they are full fleshed out song songs.
[06:13.90]I believe there's like probably 14 or 16 actual tracks.
[06:20.48]We'll see though.
[06:22.02]But let's let's go.
[06:23.58]Let's play some more Hollow Knight.
[06:29.25]Open this up.
[06:32.23]We're going to get right where we left off.
[06:34.41]And again, if you're just trickling in, this is probably going to be the last, the last Hollow Knight stream.
[06:42.60]Did I listen to Hallelujah Money?
[06:43.80]I did, and I didn't like it.
[06:45.68]I was not a fan.
[06:49.22]It wasn't really, it didn't really do anything for me.
[06:54.78]As much as it could have.
[07:01.02]Is this the music stream?
[07:04.77]The music stream.
[07:10.63]And me not liking Hallelujah Money has nothing to do with political beliefs.
[07:14.07]It has nothing to do with politics.
[07:16.93]It's just that I didn't really like the song.
[07:18.65]Alright, so I think I'm in the right spot.
[07:29.27]Am I in the right spot?
[07:30.29]I guess so.
[07:31.27]Yeah.
[07:32.25]Alright.
[07:32.57]Let's keep going.
[07:33.41]I have a lot of money, though.
[07:34.63]Maybe I should go back to town.
[07:38.11]I'm over here now, right?
[07:39.16]Yeah.
[07:42.16]Where's the lady that you can buy the notches from?
[07:44.32]Because I feel like I should go there first.
[07:48.36]I just don't know what her icon is.
[07:51.54]I'm going to go to the bank and I'm going to take out my money.
[07:59.38]Am I going to stream Little Nightmares?
[08:00.80]I'm actually not even sure what it is.
[08:02.50]I will definitely take a look.
[08:06.14]Where's that lady that sells the nachas?
[08:13.36]Oh, God.
[08:13.96]Never Trust a Purple comes in with a BS stampede.
[08:20.30]Right off the bat.
[08:23.14]Never Trust a Purple.
[08:23.75]Thank you for the $100 sneeze joke.
[08:25.29]He just wrote sneeze.
[08:28.28]I still gotta get audio for this.
[08:29.64]Still have to add audio.
[08:31.24]It's gonna be great with one of the audios there.
[08:34.06]But thank you so much, Purple.
[08:35.80]Never trusted Purple.
[08:36.58]There he is.
[08:38.18]One of our most trusted... trusted lieutenants.
[08:42.31]Dropping a hundred bucks.
[08:45.14]thank you thank you yeah dude it's gonna be it's gonna be like especially like right there he's gonna be like it's gonna be disgusting I can't wait as you sneeze that was like a half sneeze that was a I'm sneezing to pretend to sneeze but I actually did sneeze but I didn't it was like a cough
[09:17.08]But, eh, thank you, purple.
[09:19.99]You are too fucking kind.
[09:24.43]But, anyways, what I was saying is where the jokies can see.
[09:31.64]I wish I could see the actual vendor names.
[09:35.70]Does somebody want to help me out here?
[09:37.12]Where's the lady that sells the nachos?
[09:39.20]Is it over here?
[09:40.44]I feel like it's that one.
[09:47.06]Find the Minecraft lady?
[09:48.16]I know I do.
[09:49.92]She's below the train room in the first area.
[09:52.98]So, she's... This right here?
[09:57.93]Because I really don't want to, like, walk around in circles.
[10:01.91]I don't trust that purple.
[10:04.45]Bottom right of forgotten crosses.
[10:05.73]Yeah, so down here?
[10:06.43]Okay.
[10:07.75]So... There's a train up there, too.
[10:11.26]Oh, shit.
[10:13.68]Okay, cool.
[10:14.48]So, I need to go... Let's take the train back.
[10:18.08]And... No, not yet.
[10:20.17]Speaking of trains, there's probably a train over here.
[10:22.81]Not a train, or a... Like a stag.
[10:26.53]I haven't found a... Ow.
[10:28.49]I haven't found a stag in a good while, you know?
[10:35.94]So I'm assuming that this is a new area and it might be a stag.
[10:38.24]I just don't want to die here.
[10:41.64]Kingdom's Edge.
[10:43.68]Forgot I have a double jump now.
[10:48.18]Let's heal up.
[10:51.33]I hope this is an insta-mad Jerma stream.
[10:53.41]No, it won't be.
[10:57.21]I woke up on the wrong side of the bed yesterday.
[10:59.27]That's really what it was.
[11:01.67]Sometimes it happens.
[11:08.98]This is just going to be a chill stream.
[11:10.42]We're just going to hang out.
[11:13.04]I do need to find the map guy, though.
[11:15.77]Am I almost done with the game?
[11:17.09]I don't think I'm even close.
[11:19.49]I think I'm like 30% of the way through this game.
[11:23.47]Maybe, if that.
[11:27.73]Potentially like 20 to 40%, I'm gonna take the guess.
[11:32.11]But there are people that have been in this chat that said they have... Like, literally 60 hours in the game and they're still going.
[11:39.48]So that's very encouraging.
[11:44.49]Give me those jewels.
[11:49.61]I'm still in the tutorial.
[11:52.81]No, not anymore.
[11:56.75]What?
[12:00.85]I'm just farming for money at the moment.
[12:02.66]I don't really need to.
[12:06.85]Place your bets.
[12:07.41]Will this be ironic to listen back to in an hour?
[12:09.86]Probably.
[12:12.34]I wouldn't be surprised, honest to God.
[12:14.96]My mood changes like with the weather.
[12:21.52]And it's not even like sunshine that makes me happy.
[12:24.35]Darkness!
[12:27.85]Darkness!
[12:32.03]I get my energy from pure darkness!
[12:41.63]Lots of you people think that you get energy from the sun.
[12:44.81]I get my energy from pure darkness.
[12:48.35]I'm one of those people.
[12:49.43]Edgy.
[12:59.86]Sith Lord.
[13:06.02]I'm really taking my sweet ass time, aren't I?
[13:09.44]Ow.
[13:19.94]Real Zombie Jesus wants me to go down and hit the back wall here.
[13:23.20]Alright, I will.
[13:24.42]Thank you for the five dollars.
[13:25.36]That's not that wall.
[13:29.86]This wall down here?
[13:32.08]Ow.
[13:34.66]Go back down and hit the right wall near the bees.
[13:36.61]I'm only backseating this because you will never find it.
[13:40.77]Like, right here?
[13:41.93]Like, this wall right there?
[13:46.57]Um...
[13:50.12]Is that what you were talking about, man?
[13:51.40]Well, thank you for the five dollars, and regardless, zombie Jesus.
[13:55.27]Oh, I see.
[13:55.69]Okay, I see.
[13:58.23]Okay, there it is.
[13:58.91]Ooh.
[14:04.42]Well, that was a five dollar hint.
[14:08.26]The secret bee area?
[14:12.66]Holy shit, he really did take me to a secret bee... The hive.
[14:15.49]A secret bee area.
[14:19.38]Well, thanks a lot, man.
[14:21.28]This is gonna be fun.
[14:21.98]I love this area already.
[14:26.15]Oh, no.
[14:26.47]Watch out.
[14:27.19]It's Mr. Poppin's Penguin.
[14:32.29]Got him.
[14:34.05]Oh, he has bees inside of him.
[14:35.67]Got it.
[14:38.90]See that, like, reaction?
[14:41.50]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14:42.98]We need to, like, take another picture.
[14:45.58]So, like, I didn't find this area...
[14:48.91]But, like, I need you guys to, like... Like, we're gonna just say that I did.
[14:53.51]So, I look like shit right now, but it's okay.
[15:00.05]Uh, where is it?
[15:08.67]Here.
[15:13.59]Like this.
[15:15.38]So, we need to, like...
[15:17.23]Wait, is this like even synced up?
[15:22.63]It's like not even synced up correctly.
[15:24.83]Hello, my name is Jeremy.
[15:25.87]I'm twitch.tv.
[15:27.27]Hello, how are you doing?
[15:30.51]We must find him.
[15:31.43]We must destroy him.
[15:34.07]Okay, let's go like this.
[15:39.99]No, shit.
[15:40.83]Oh, God.
[15:41.27]We have like a donation.
[15:43.35]Hold on a second.
[15:44.07]I'm going to disappear.

[15:51.32]D'oh!
[15:54.48]Lucky Strike with a 200 fucking dollars, dude!
[15:58.66]Oh my god.

[16:20.41]Thank you, Lucky Strike 316.
[16:21.63]That's $200.
[16:24.29]And I haven't even made any jokes yet.
[16:27.47]Do you want me just to cough?
[16:28.27]Is that what you want me to do?
[16:29.17]Is that what you want?
[16:30.58]Okay.
[16:32.16]I'll do it with the face cam on.
[16:35.24]I'll do it... I'll do it with the fucking face cam on.
[16:39.70]But hold on.
[16:40.28]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16:41.87]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16:44.75]What's up?
[16:49.80]I think I think Twitch alerts just broke Because never trust a purple just gave another hundred bucks, and it didn't pop up on the screen Yeah, well that one did be fans of 347 Never trust purple just gave another hundred dollars
[17:10.50]And it's a, let's see.
[17:12.34]When you're two hours into Netflix and sneeze, and she gives you the look, Jerm of fear.
[17:16.67]In all honesty, it's been pretty shitty for me lately, and your streams and uploads have helped make it a lot easier.
[17:21.59]I'm honored to mod for this channel, thank you.
[17:23.77]Also, please do the entire stream with a desynced webcam.
[17:29.60]Oh, my God.
[17:30.32]Well, dude, thanks.
[17:31.31]Thank you so fucking much, dude.
[17:33.37]I'm happy you've been a mod for as long as you have.
[17:36.05]You're a legend.
[17:38.13]Thank you, man.
[17:39.63]Hopefully you feel a little bit better.
[17:43.96]But we're going to put that webcam back on.
[17:46.28]I'm going to do desync the webcam.
[17:50.71]Hold on, let me, like, move this.
[17:51.79]Look at how, like, why am I, like, this far over here?
[17:54.52]Why am I this far over on this side?
[17:56.64]Why am I, like, looking over here?
[17:58.66]My body's, like, turned almost completely this way.
[18:03.76]And this is probably very confusing for you guys, because, like, you can't even fucking see with the words that are coming out of my mouth right now.
[18:08.44]And it's probably very confusing.
[18:09.42]You probably think, what's this desynced piece of shit think he's doing?
[18:16.66]Alright, tell me when you hear this.
[18:18.16]Meh!
[18:20.23]What do you mean, tell me?
[18:21.35]No, that doesn't make any sense.
[18:23.10]Tell me when you hear this.
[18:26.18]That's not gonna help me at all.
[18:28.46]But anyways, this is what I wanted to do.
[18:31.00]I didn't find this secret, but we're gonna pretend I did.
[18:33.46]Am I looking in the right spot?
[18:36.09]So I gotta look over there, right?
[18:37.43]Yeah, like this.
[18:43.51]No, no, no, let me go like this.
[18:46.55]No, okay, that's fine.
[18:50.17]There you go, you got it.
[18:57.29]That's how you know that I did it.
[18:58.59]Okay, let's go.
[19:05.46]Let's go.
[19:06.04]Oh, purple just dropped some more cash.
[19:09.48]Although, are the pits even going through?
[19:11.56]Oh, there we go.
[19:12.90]Okay, I guess they were.
[19:15.99]Alright, I gotta play this game.
[19:17.27]What the hell am I doing?
[19:19.80]Never Trust Purple, thank you for the $17, $18.
[19:22.36]Again, not a sentimental donation.
[19:24.36]I just wanted to get the next badge.
[19:26.24]Just take the money.
[19:27.02]Don't even read the donation message.
[19:29.86]Oh, my God.
[19:37.31]Well, I already did.
[19:38.69]Thank you, regardless.
[19:40.73]Do I have a squirt bottle of mustard?
[19:42.83]No.
[19:45.11]No, that's...
[19:50.49]Hold on, I want to see if that looks as fucking funny as I think it does.
[19:55.32]A squirt bottle of mustard.
[19:58.04]Do you think that that is a fucking squirt, like spray mustard bottle?
[20:04.14]No, that's a bottle of Clorox spray cleaner.
[20:07.69]That's not mustard.
[20:10.71]Oh my god, I want spray mustard now.
[20:13.37]Think about that in a hot dog.
[20:15.47]Think about that.
[20:16.49]That'd be so much easier.
[20:17.67]It wouldn't get everywhere.
[20:18.37]It wouldn't like slip and slide all over the bun.
[20:20.41]You get a spray can aerosol.
[20:23.22]Holy shit.
[20:26.00]That's my idea.
[20:26.76]Nobody steal that.
[20:29.10]Right now.
[20:29.38]What's today?
[20:29.66]8-15.
[20:29.70]8-15.
[20:29.74]March 24th, 2017.
[20:30.20]8-15.
[20:30.24]Spray mustard cleaner.
[20:31.30]I just came up with it.
[20:38.54]And you want to bring me to court?
[20:39.32]You want to fucking make that?
[20:41.01]Guess what?
[20:41.59]Twitch?
[20:42.61]Twitch keeps these fucking things.
[20:44.91]There's a timestamp.
[20:45.93]That's a verbal contract that I have right now.
[20:49.77]Verbal patent.
[20:51.15]Mustard spray aerosol mustard.
[20:52.91]That's a verbal patent.
[20:53.97]Thank you very much.
[20:54.87]That's mine.
[20:57.55]Somebody better clip that.
[21:03.99]Okay, we haven't played the fucking game for more than five seconds.
[21:11.75]I mean, I got to this bee area and I got a fucking meltdown.
[21:16.43]Yeah, I said the date.
[21:17.26]I said the date and the time.
[21:19.70]Deleted VOD.
[21:20.46]Amazon owns the patent now.
[21:24.14]No, you can't do that to me.
[21:25.36]Because now we have this clip.
[21:26.58]Somebody's going to clip that clip of me talking about how you deleted the VOD.
[21:30.18]That's a lot of money.
[21:38.23]I better get an attorney.
[21:43.53]Thank you, Luna Zubuko, for the five bucks.
[21:45.63]Don't ever stop being handsome.
[21:47.15]Well, thank you.
[21:49.33]Sometimes I do stop being handsome.
[21:50.91]When I, like, wake up in the morning and I look like somebody's shit in my face.
[21:55.29]And then purple with 236.
[21:56.47]It was Colonel Mustard in the bathroom with the Clorox.
[22:00.72]Oh, my God.
[22:04.64]Alright.
[22:05.78]Let's, like, let's play Hollow Knight for a little while.
[22:08.04]Why don't we...
[22:14.25]Talking about you getting clipped.
[22:16.49]Wait, let me look down there.
[22:17.37]Do you have everything down there?
[22:20.25]I'm scared being in here, because this is a secret area.
[22:22.99]And secret areas... Oh, wait a minute.
[22:25.93]Hold on a second.
[22:26.58]We've got a Gabe the Gloob and a grossy Jerma suplex.
[22:32.72]These bit animations are fucking awesome.
[22:34.56]I just need to get them sized.
[22:36.30]Like, that's a me thing.
[22:38.14]But Church of Kenny just gave 50 bucks.
[22:42.12]And they say... Well, we are honored to have you, Kenny.
[22:44.98]Honored.
[22:45.18]I thought I just got hurt by nothing, but... Yeah.
[23:08.68]You guys are fucking awesome.
[23:10.87]I couldn't ask for like a more fun, like engaging community.
[23:16.83]Some of the shit that you guys say is like extremely fucking clever and hilarious.
[23:23.50]I'm surprised every day by some of the fucking funny, amazing things you guys say.
[23:30.15]You guys are all fucking hilarious.
[23:32.38]And, like, don't ever think you're not.
[23:33.64]Because, like, I've seen some unbelievably funny things in this chat.
[23:38.54]And unbelievably touching things in this chat.
[23:47.65]We're not honored.
[23:48.41]Fuck that guy.
[23:49.71]Wait, what?
[23:54.01]Wait.
[23:56.09]Oh, by the way, new subs.
[23:57.01]I gotta get, like, new subsounds.
[23:59.61]We've been using the same, like, wait, what?
[24:02.37]For fucking, like, four months.
[24:04.75]Ooh, a bench.
[24:11.21]Still no map of this area.
[24:12.49]Is there even a map of this place?
[24:17.25]Seriously, the chat alone makes you proud to work at Twitch.
[24:21.52]Yeah, that's... There's a lot of fucking really interesting, fun fucking people here.
[24:30.17]It surprises me every day.
[24:39.98]Oh shit, I keep forgetting that he's filled with bugs.
[24:44.50]I need to use the cave.
[24:45.18]Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[24:46.18]There's one of these weird orange sliced trees.
[24:47.93]I'm gonna clear the zone first.
[24:52.31]Oh, what?
[24:52.61]I was trying to go down with it.
[24:53.53]I was trying to go down.
[25:02.26]How do I feel about the new gorilla songs?
[25:03.50]I like them.
[25:05.88]I think Andromeda and Saturn bars are my two favorites.
[25:13.91]Didn't really think too much of the We Have the Power song.
[25:17.49]It was just... It was cool.
[25:21.69]Let me make sure I didn't mess anything.
[25:29.14]Ow.
[25:31.08]Gonna get the timing down on that.
[25:32.90]Or he'll just run into this wall.
[25:35.72]Come on.
[25:37.78]Oh, come on.
[25:38.46]Come on.
[25:38.84]Come on.
[25:39.24]Come on.
[25:39.62]Come on.
[25:39.96]Fall all the way down.
[25:40.58]Who cares?
[25:46.46]Oh, now there's two of them down here.
[25:48.86]I'm trying to glance over and read this donation at the same time to not be stung by these fucking spike bees.
[25:55.12]But... Hold on one second.
[25:58.96]Come on.
[26:03.03]Alright, so Never Trust Purple gave another 10 bucks.
[26:06.21]Purple.
[26:07.89]Purple, you are... You are just dropping money right now.
[26:12.19]Mackerel, your editor, who you probably speak to on a daily basis, is forcing me to spend money to tell you to stream Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney.
[26:18.90]I guess he's just that lazy.
[26:22.38]I have never played any of those games.
[26:26.20]The only thing I know about Ace Attorney...
[26:29.43]That's the objection thing that everybody says.
[26:34.62]That's it.
[26:35.52]I don't even know what it means.
[26:38.04]Guys, I don't even know what objection means in a church.
[26:41.56]When you're in church, I mean in a law, in a courtroom, in a church, in a courtroom.
[26:47.86]When you're in a courtroom and somebody says objection, can you just do that?
[26:50.57]Are you allowed just to do that?
[26:53.74]So if one lawyer says something that the other lawyer doesn't like, objection!
[26:58.44]Can that mean anything?
[27:00.24]Can he object to the tie that the other attorney is wearing?
[27:06.85]Like the prosecutor could be in full swing talking about, and that's when he drove up, and he got out of the car, and he put both of his hands around his neck, and just started squeezing, and he was choking.
[27:18.73]Objection!
[27:19.19]I don't like your tie.
[27:22.37]Would I get thrown out of court?
[27:24.05]What would happen?
[27:24.51]Are you allowed just to do that shit?
[27:29.82]I don't even know what it means.
[27:43.65]Play the game?
[27:44.32]I am playing the game!
[27:52.52]Don't you know we don't even, like, play games on this channel?
[27:57.72]We play games to be able to talk about dumb shit that happens.
[28:02.44]Oh, this is different.
[28:13.83]Okay, um... This is for a kind of a secret area.
[28:17.89]This area is fairly large.
[28:25.03]Come here.
[28:27.11]Oh, shit.
[28:31.75]Oh, that's... We got... Hold on a second.
[28:34.85]This is important.
[28:35.65]We got another big donation here.
[28:37.91]And this is not even, like, in the right spot.
[28:42.31]Uh, Sneagil.
[28:46.53]Sneagil gave a hundred bucks with the the gigantic hundred dollar Snail the snail guy gave a hundred bucks, and he did a hundred dollar cregasm and says Hey, hey Incan mummy streamer you rock How am I a mummy streamer?
[29:12.93]Like what are you talking about you don't like King like King Tut oh?
[29:17.39]Are you making a play on the fact that I've been resting?
[29:23.40]Oh shit, I gotta pay attention here.
[29:27.68]But thank you, Sneak.
[29:31.25]Garlic Mummy streamer.
[29:33.63]King Tut?
[29:34.19]What is King Tut?
[29:40.51]King Tut was a guy, right?
[29:43.89]Was King Tut a guy or was that like a made-up person?
[29:46.49]No, I did a project on King Tut.
[29:48.53]I dressed up... Like we had to do this project in middle school.
[29:54.07]Where we had... They gave us... They gave us like a person in history.
[30:01.73]And I had to like... I guess I had to like dress up as a mummy.
[30:03.95]I had to be a mummy from my book report when I was like fucking 12.
[30:16.42]He was a pharaoh?
[30:19.58]Yeah, but he was still a mummy, isn't he?
[30:22.30]Was King Tut fake?
[30:23.40]I'm kidding!
[30:24.14]That was a joke!
[30:25.16]It's from the Buffy the Vampire Slayer book.
[30:32.32]Oh, God.
[30:35.29]I really want that map maker.
[30:36.59]Where's the map guy?
[30:41.67]I haven't seen any map shit anywhere.
[30:43.03]There's a lot of money down here!
[30:48.76]Of course it was.
[30:49.46]It was.
[30:49.90]It was a joke.
[30:57.91]Um.
[30:59.33]I guess I can't go that way.
[31:01.43]There's just a ton of money over here.
[31:06.35]Money.
[31:06.83]Mummy stream.
[31:07.55]Money stream.
[31:09.85]I don't like this.
[31:10.47]That I have $1500.
[31:11.35]And I'm going to a place I don't know.
[31:20.93]Shit.
[31:21.03]I thought he was going to go underneath me.
[31:22.23]I have way too much money right now.
[31:37.70]Oh.
[31:40.78]Shit.
[31:41.16]I was going for a cheeky kill right there and I didn't get it.
[31:46.61]Are we going on a lunch date for the next Jerma stream?
[31:50.23]When?
[31:53.69]What are you talking about?
[31:54.59]Are we going on a lunch date?
[32:02.78]Dude, whoever told me to come here, seriously, you are... You are really, really, really good.
[32:07.98]Because I'm scared, though.
[32:11.83]I don't like getting this much money.
[32:15.44]This is more money than I think I've ever carried.
[32:16.90]I think the most I had ever was like 4,000, right?
[32:20.42]Maybe?
[32:20.66]Ooh, what's that?
[32:22.92]Oh, there's a puzzle piece in there.
[32:28.56]Can I not open this?
[32:30.82]Do I need like an ultra charge?
[32:33.79]How the fuck do I get in there?
[32:35.98]Alright, I think I know what I have to do.
[32:38.44]If I was smart, I would think it would be something like this.
[32:42.28]Where I have to, like, grab onto the wall and go, like, charge over there?
[32:45.47]Nope.
[32:48.61]Well, let me just run into these two fucking balloon animals.
[32:51.49]Alright, hold on.
[32:52.69]Hold on a second here.
[32:54.37]Easy.
[32:57.95]Okay, this is getting real hairy.
[33:03.13]This is like, there's too much shit on the ground.
[33:09.70]You balloons are really starting to cause me pain.
[33:14.20]Oh my god.
[33:16.24]Why are you flying around so much?
[33:17.76]Like, just fucking... You're too fat to do this.
[33:22.59]Ruining my fucking immersion.
[33:23.97]These things are so fat, they could never do something like that.
[33:26.35]Let's try that.
[33:28.05]Oh my god.
[33:29.55]Get out of the fucking way.
[33:33.47]Thank... The good lord.
[33:37.61]That's gonna have to work, right?
[33:39.72]It was already open.
[33:43.18]Alright, here we go.
[33:44.50]I'm gonna get it and it's gonna go... Got it.
[34:02.74]What is this?
[34:04.51]Secret!
[34:05.97]Not a secret.
[34:07.13]Just this.
[34:07.51]Yeah.
[34:18.62]I want to find the map maker.
[34:22.04]Where is he?
[34:23.52]Speaking of which, am I gonna play Yooka-Laylee?
[34:28.96]Yeah.
[34:30.70]Yeah.
[34:31.50]Maybe for a stream.
[34:33.72]I don't know, though.
[34:34.89]Possibly.
[34:38.37]I don't like this.
[34:42.41]I feel like this is going to an area I don't want to go to.
[34:46.59]Oh, you got a long hallway with these things.
[34:50.10]We're going to take one look.
[34:52.98]And if this looks like a... Okay, that's a boss area.
[34:54.96]We aren't doing that yet.
[34:55.92]Not with fucking 1,800 bucks.
[35:02.88]Not with 1,800.
[35:03.88]I need to try to find the map maker.
[35:06.44]Or... I don't know, like...
[35:12.01]Why can I break these?
[35:15.61]Seems weird.
[35:21.86]Have I already been up this way?
[35:22.92]I think I've already been over here.
[35:28.79]Coward, coward!
[35:29.71]I got 1800 bucks!
[35:33.23]You want me to lose all this?
[35:41.90]Ugh.
[35:44.44]The bench.
[35:44.96]I know I have the bench, but... Whatever, let's do it.
[35:54.31]Brave streamer.
[35:59.79]Alright, we're gonna be brave.
[36:00.59]We're not gonna be a horse's ass.
[36:04.81]Or a pile of shits.
[36:06.33]We're gonna be brave.
[36:08.89]We'll see.
[36:13.11]You know, I don't want to be a pile of shits.
[36:15.22]I want to be brave.
[36:19.84]Here we go.
[36:21.90]Oh boy.
[36:24.12]Small thing, I know your kind.
[36:26.82]If you attempt to resolve your past, then I know I am not the queen you seek.
[36:29.68]It is the pale beings that fear blame for your nature.
[36:33.49]Though this hive exists within hollowness, we play no part in its attempt per perpetuation.
[36:40.48]Okay.
[36:42.08]To rail against nature is folly.
[36:43.36]All things must accept an end.
[36:44.44]Alright.
[36:47.54]Well.
[36:48.74]If I dream... If I, like, dream gun you or dream smash you, then we're going to have to fight.
[36:52.74]So I ain't doing that right now.
[36:57.45]Not with this much money in my pocket.
[37:01.25]Maybe with a little less money in my pocket.
[37:02.95]You know what I mean?
[37:04.55]Hiveblood.
[37:11.59]Hiveblood.
[37:12.25]Is it a charm?
[37:17.67]It is.
[37:19.13]Golden Nugget of the Hive's precious hardened nectar heals the bearer's wounds over time, allowing them to regain health without focusing soul.
[37:33.86]Nice.
[37:34.28]Okay.
[37:40.14]Um...
[37:48.89]Alright.
[37:51.29]That's it?
[37:56.34]I did it?
[37:57.94]First try.
[38:00.10]Bet you guys didn't even know that shit.
[38:03.00]Didn't even know.
[38:03.52]You do the dream smash.
[38:05.28]That you get, you kill her instantly.
[38:12.56]I'm gonna make like, I'm gonna make like a fucking like dream smash.
[38:14.88]Like, okay, so here we go.
[38:15.92]You gotta get like two different screenshots here.
[38:19.32]So, like, I'm gonna do point.
[38:25.29]There we go.
[38:27.31]That's how you know.
[38:27.89]Like, just make sure.
[38:28.47]That's three different screenshots.
[38:29.65]Just in case somebody didn't understand, like, the fucking secret.
[38:36.00]I'm gonna make sure you get the three separate screenshots there.
[38:49.79]Mustard spray.
[38:52.33]How many pages we got now?
[38:53.29]That's like probably like four.
[38:59.23]Face cam still not in sync.
[39:00.41]It's not going to be.
[39:01.40]I'm never gonna sync it up ever again.
[39:06.78]I guess that's all I can do.
[39:09.72]Unless there's a spot I haven't checked.
[39:10.90]I don't know.
[39:15.82]Wow, he's very smart and tall, while also being good at games.
[39:20.30]Thank you.
[39:22.26]Hey, thanks.
[39:24.38]Well, that's open now, in case I ever need to go back there.
[39:27.92]But will I?
[39:30.16]I don't know.
[39:36.25]I so desperately want the mapmaker.
[39:39.87]I'm not sure he's even gonna be here.
[39:45.73]Uh... Yeah, we're just kind of running around in circles now.
[39:49.23]Alright, let's just leave.
[39:51.45]I want to go up to the train.
[39:54.36]This is cool, though.
[40:05.22]Another B game?
[40:06.40]Yeah, this is Super Mario Land.
[40:08.40]Super Mario 3D World.
[40:12.15]It's just pretty much copying Mario 3D World, you know?
[40:19.99]I haven't been this way?
[40:24.62]I guess I have not been over here.
[40:25.62]Oh, there's another little shortcut.
[40:30.74]Damn.
[40:36.16]Well, at least I opened that up.
[40:37.64]I guess I have to go back there and fight the queen or whatever.
[40:47.08]Nothing.
[40:47.42]Just gonna go up.
[40:51.06]Haven't been here.
[40:56.50]Even more money.
[40:58.16]And no map still.
[41:04.55]This juke gets a B?
[41:07.31]That was an A plus Jupiter, I don't know what you mean.
[41:19.17]Up or right?
[41:20.49]Looks like we're going right.
[41:21.31]This is a little passage.
[41:30.70]Ah, finally!
[41:31.52]Nice.
[41:31.74]Okay, he's over here somewhere.
[41:35.48]The hell is this?
[41:40.26]Fools!
[41:44.60]Map maker?
[41:45.02]No.
[41:50.37]There he is.
[41:51.15]This way.
[41:52.55]There he is.
[41:53.03]Thank God.
[41:53.81]Please.
[41:54.03]I would love a map of this area.
[41:55.94]Kingdom's Edge.
[42:16.91]So, I was down there.
[42:18.31]Looks like I explored everything down there, I guess.
[42:21.19]The only thing that's left is to go down right or up right.
[42:24.97]Just pretty much anywhere here.
[42:25.87]I really need to find... Well, City of Tears.
[42:31.30]Let me look at the big map.
[42:33.18]Alright, we got... We got a little bit of a... Here we go.
[42:36.90]Watch this.
[42:38.06]We're going up and we're going left.
[42:39.12]I'm gonna come back here.
[42:43.04]But not before I unlock this.
[42:45.84]Because I believe this was locked up.
[42:50.16]Not before I just explode, too.
[42:52.70]No big deal.
[42:53.12]Because now we're here.
[42:58.50]Kingdom's Edge.
[42:59.78]Wait a minute.
[43:02.01]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[43:03.77]No, I'm incorrect.
[43:07.31]I thought I could get through here.
[43:08.45]No, I can't.
[43:12.85]Secret?
[43:14.39]Secret!
[43:17.35]Would you look at that?
[43:20.25]You just have to climb through there.
[43:26.88]Nice.
[43:27.12]Can I go down there?
[43:30.70]Maybe?
[43:36.56]Brings us to here, which brings us up.
[43:38.30]Let's go... Let's go spend some of this money.
[43:48.44]Because I have a lot of money.
[43:50.98]And... Stag it up.
[43:58.02]City storerooms.
[43:58.90]Let me take a look.
[43:59.62]So where is the Notch lady?
[44:01.93]Where's Notch?
[44:05.97]Right there, right?
[44:07.37]So if I go to... I guess I could go up from City of Tears, right?
[44:15.55]Hmm.
[44:20.74]Go up from city of stairs into the right.
[44:26.14]I don't have enough pale ore.
[44:27.80]Use your second pale ore.
[44:28.66]I thought you needed two.
[44:31.40]Don't you need two pale ore to do it?
[44:39.92]Do I have enough money?
[44:40.69]Do I have enough of this?
[44:42.67]I thought it was expensive and you need two pale ore.
[44:50.82]What do you guys think?
[44:54.80]Do I have enough, or do I need to go to the bank in the Queen's capital, whatever?
[44:58.30]Yeah, I need two.
[45:03.04]Just one for the first... I already did one.
[45:05.74]So I need 2,002 ore.
[45:10.12]Okay.
[45:10.90]Well, in that case, we're going to go buy some notches.
[45:13.92]So let's go buy one, which I believe is up here.
[45:16.66]So we're going to go city storeroom.
[45:20.85]And we're going to go buy a nudge.
[45:23.52]I only have one pale ore at the moment.
[45:26.72]I used the first one already.
[45:29.58]But just to be complete... Yeah, see?
[45:32.80]One.
[45:34.12]I could sell this shit, too.
[45:39.18]160.
[45:39.28]I need 40 more of those.
[45:41.16]Alright.
[45:43.39]So, we're going to go up and to the right.
[45:45.45]I believe that's where it is, right?
[45:47.65]Yeah.
[45:51.95]Should be able to buy another notch.
[45:58.05]I don't think I can afford the other one, though.
[46:01.21]At least not yet.
[46:03.73]So I need to go... Where the hell am I?
[46:07.96]Oh, right there, okay.
[46:09.88]Left, up, right.
[46:17.16]Left, up, right.
[46:25.20]Let's go!
[46:28.42]Half of this chat is actual conversation, and the other half is space emotes.
[46:35.71]Yep.
[46:37.01]That sounds about right.
[46:43.13]Infected crossroads?
[46:44.49]Wait.
[46:46.99]It wasn't like this before, was it?
[46:48.23]I don't remember it being like this.
[46:54.84]Have you seen this?
[46:58.97]Have you heard about this?
[46:59.69]Whoa, what's going on here?
[47:06.21]Have you seen this?
[47:06.63]Have you heard about this?
[47:10.63]Whoa, have you seen this?
[47:13.25]Have you heard about this?
[47:20.13]Okay, what the fuck am I doing?
[47:26.30]Alright, let's see.
[47:27.20]I can do... I need three more charms.
[47:30.58]I can buy one of these.
[47:31.26]We're going to buy a notch.
[47:32.63]Yes.
[47:39.85]What does this one mean?
[47:44.90]So I need three more charms to get this.
[47:46.94]To be able to come back and buy that.
[47:48.90]But is this one any good?
[47:53.74]This charm seeps lifeblood and will certainly improve your constitution.
[48:00.86]Does that give me more max health?
[48:07.10]Is anybody listening to me?
[48:09.22]I'm just going to buy it.
[48:11.59]Just fuck it.
[48:12.03]Why not add to my collection?
[48:19.13]I want them all.
[48:20.57]I want them.
[48:23.51]I don't... I want these.
[48:30.54]Let's go to the notches and let's see if I have enough room.
[48:33.01]Alright, what do I... Stupid compass.
[48:37.05]That's okay.
[48:40.09]I have one notch left.
[48:41.09]Do I need that though?
[48:42.07]Is it worth power of spells?
[48:46.17]This one's four.
[48:47.45]Okay, so this is four.
[48:50.97]It heals me without needing to focus soul.
[48:53.53]This makes me heal faster while focusing soul.
[48:57.40]Should I just equip this one?
[48:59.64]How long does it take? ...
[49:09.78]I was told that spores room is essential and you have to keep it on.
[49:17.29]We're gonna try that and see what it does.
[49:20.79]Do I have any other one cost?
[49:22.03]This one... This is loose geo.
[49:27.78]Dangerous situations.
[49:29.68]I really wish that this didn't take a slot.
[49:32.16]I really do.
[49:34.16]I think that's alright for now.
[49:36.95]Gains soul when taking damage.
[49:38.11]Don't really need that.
[49:39.81]The range.
[49:47.21]High blood only heals one.
[49:48.40]You have to heal the rest.
[49:49.38]Really?
[49:52.90]Really?
[49:58.82]So, hold on.
[49:59.40]Ooh, it changed the way my health looks too.
[50:01.43]Hold on.
[50:03.11]Let me take some hits here.
[50:08.03]So, it looks like it's working.
[50:09.75]Okay, it just worked.
[50:10.97]It's going, it's going, it's going.
[50:14.81]It filled.
[50:15.21]Oh, okay.
[50:19.54]So it only heals the most recent damage.
[50:23.38]That's it.
[50:26.02]But it gives me gold health.
[50:31.04]Hmm.
[50:34.86]I'll... Hmm.
[50:40.45]Well, here's the theory, right?
[50:42.29]As long as you just don't get hit within 10 seconds.
[50:45.71]So if I can dodge around, hit, hit, dodge around, and not get hit, this will happen right away, right?
[50:51.29]Yeah.
[50:52.75]That's actually pretty good.
[50:53.98]I like that.
[50:55.26]As long as I can not get hit for the 10 seconds, that's a pretty big deal.
[51:02.12]Yeah, okay, there it is again.
[51:03.24]What happens if I get hit right now, like again, while it's recharging?
[51:06.99]It'll just do the next one.
[51:08.81]Yeah, we're going to keep it on.
[51:10.91]Ooh, wait a second.
[51:12.01]Hold on now.
[51:12.61]I don't know if I like that.
[51:16.25]So, you could be at the very end of one of your bees.
[51:19.58]Bee health, recharging, and heal.
[51:21.28]And it'll just skip and go right.
[51:22.60]Okay.
[51:22.98]Okay.
[51:24.61]So I gotta be really careful that if I have a charging bee heart, not to heal.
[51:29.81]Because it will just finish that one and heal me for that.
[51:32.15]Not the one after it.
[51:33.89]That's actually... That's okay, though.
[51:40.68]Whatever.
[51:40.96]Alright, where to next?
[51:43.44]I guess we could head back here.
[51:53.46]Yeah, we'll go back.
[51:54.28]We'll go back to the lower right here.
[51:56.12]And keep exploring Kingdom's Edge.
[52:03.57]Mm-hmm.
[52:08.05]So I need one more.
[52:11.85]I want to see what happens there.
[52:12.77]Alright, so if you do get hit, it just continues down the line and starts healing you for the next one.
[52:16.97]So, you want us to do one, two, like three.
[52:19.25]Like, start now.
[52:20.63]Nope.
[52:20.91]Okay.
[52:21.03]Okay.
[52:23.74]Eventually, I think I'll be good enough where I'll be able to time this.
[52:27.90]So, let's see.
[52:28.96]Okay.
[52:30.23]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[52:36.45]Nope.
[52:38.63]I didn't get it right.
[52:39.13]You know what I mean?
[52:40.73]Like, try and queue it up so it's bang, bang.
[52:42.41]Just heal, heal.
[52:42.91]It's going to be very difficult to do that in the middle of a fight, though.
[52:46.61]I just can't worry about that.
[52:57.23]I want to see if it's possible, though.
[53:04.04]Bad eye.
[53:06.48]What's going on here?
[53:12.04]Why is this pointing up this way?
[53:13.87]I don't know.
[53:16.99]Why don't you just not do that?
[53:20.91]I mean, I don't have to do that.
[53:23.99]Uh, no.
[53:24.63]Where's the... Wait a minute.
[53:33.34]Alright, hit me.
[53:40.00]Give me a hit.
[53:43.50]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[53:47.03]What's going on there?
[53:49.89]Maybe you just can't do that.
[53:51.07]Maybe it can tell that you're holding the button and it won't heal the first one.
[54:02.70]Okay.
[54:07.26]Oh well.
[54:12.91]Bang.
[54:20.07]Back to this area.
[54:23.33]I think it'll heal the one charging if you do it while it's charging.
[54:25.51]Yeah, I think that's what's happening.
[54:28.35]It won't finish that one.
[54:29.83]It'll just... It will finish that one as if I was charging it.
[54:36.10]So, we need to go just to the right.
[54:44.81]Do I know a code for E-24?
[54:46.80]I do not.
[54:47.60]I don't have an E-24 code.
[54:50.64]Now, we're going to go back down to... Where?
[54:59.44]Okay, no, this, yeah, it's just this way.
[55:01.96]You don't take the stag, you just go under it, right?
[55:05.12]One down.
[55:06.86]Uh, no, that's right.
[55:14.31]I gotta update my messenger bar?
[55:15.47]That's true.
[55:16.73]You are correct, I do.
[55:19.95]Wait, what, which one was it?
[55:20.87]Am I, like, insane?
[55:25.13]Which one was, like, sneak down in the corner?
[55:29.67]I just went to the same one.
[55:33.69]Um, am I, like, why am I insane right now?
[55:36.75]Didn't I, like, sneak through one of these?
[55:38.93]Like, underneath the bottom right?
[55:50.24]It's beneath me.
[55:52.56]Oh, right, right, right, right.
[55:53.36]Okay, right, right, right, right, yeah.
[55:55.80]Yeah, it's, like, the fake stag station.
[55:57.48]Okay.
[56:02.75]Yep, there it is.
[56:03.33]Yeah, for a second I'm like, yeah, it's the king station, stag station.
[56:07.91]What the fuck's going on?
[56:08.85]Yeah, I get it.
[56:10.21]Now, which one of these do I want to go through?
[56:14.21]They both lead to the same place, right?
[56:17.27]Yeah, I guess it doesn't matter.
[56:18.89]We're going to go try going to the right.
[56:20.45]Let's take a look this way.
[56:31.52]So, up and to the right.
[56:34.44]I wonder... What is this way?
[56:39.37]Hmm.
[56:43.33]Hmm.
[56:44.93]Ow.
[56:48.65]Interesting.
[56:49.45]Okay.
[56:58.12]I don't think I can do this.
[57:01.87]Don't think I can do this yet.
[57:02.86]Unless I can I... No.
[57:06.66]I need, like, water shoes.
[57:08.58]I don't have water shoes yet.
[57:18.29]Well, we can either go up or down right.
[57:23.20]Down right.
[57:24.32]Down right.
[57:27.80]Why are you eating ice cream, you lactose intolerant, Sam?
[57:31.06]It's because you can't... you can't not eat ice cream.
[57:37.74]Not eating ice cream is like saying, like, I... I... I... I'm... I'm not... Hold on, I just didn't want to... I didn't want to fall in the water before I made my dumb reference.
[57:48.92]Alright, we're gonna do this.
[57:49.52]We're gonna just explore this area with our weird jumpy friends.
[57:54.89]You guys drop a lot of money, holy crap.
[57:59.19]You see how much money those guys drop?
[58:00.84]Holy crap!
[58:03.94]These guys don't really take knockback, do they?
[58:12.79]Just gonna wait till this fills up so I can recharge.
[58:23.87]Wow, holy crap.
[58:25.41]Enough of that.
[58:25.85]Enough holy crapping.
[58:27.81]Alright.
[58:32.23]This kind of leads me back that way.
[58:37.65]I do like these Amber enemies, though.
[58:40.52]They're cool.
[58:42.48]Reminds me of Jurassic Park.
[58:49.49]I could see this charm being very good at bosses.
[58:52.75]Because I don't have to worry about it.
[58:53.85]As long as I can not get hit for like that 10 seconds.
[58:57.07]Once I get like a boss pattern down, I won't have to worry about standing there and going... Okay...
[59:17.49]Another place to go.
[59:19.21]Another box of gems?
[59:24.88]I have a lot of money.
[59:31.85]I've got a feeling we're getting close to a boss.
[59:38.17]If I were to take a guess.
[59:40.33]But I can't go that way, so I'm sure we'll go this way.
[59:50.97]Why does it want me to do this?
[59:54.15]It's like a little slot right there.
[59:56.91]This is still part of that just secret fucking wall.
[60:15.75]That's the amazing part about games like this.
[60:19.69]This is just because I went in a secret door that was stuck in a wall somewhere.
[60:27.05]That's fucking ridiculous.
[60:33.10]I can hear a caterpillar, I believe.
[60:37.52]Wait, let me check that wall.
[60:49.14]Fuck.
[60:50.04]Well, I got it.
[60:51.18]I got off.
[60:52.34]Whoops-a-daisy.
[61:01.96]How old am I?
[61:03.03]Thirty-eight.
[61:03.89]Thirty-eight and a half.
[61:11.95]I turn forty next month.
[61:20.67]Oh!
[61:22.13]Well, here's how you get back here.
[61:25.60]Interesting.
[61:31.06]Oh, come on.
[61:31.50]I thought I got that.
[61:40.80]Fill it up.
[61:48.09]No, I can't latch on.
[61:51.97]Bullshit.
[61:58.64]Where is this gonna lead me?
[61:59.54]Is there, like, a place for me to get out of here?
[62:02.04]To the left?
[62:02.52]Or what?
[62:08.48]This goes up really high.
[62:10.17]Damn.
[62:17.53]I'm going all the way up here?
[62:18.49]What is... What?
[62:25.10]Okay.
[62:28.24]I guess this is to the right of this way.
[62:30.21]Interesting enough.
[62:31.05]Whatever.
[62:34.37]Let's keep going up.
[62:37.13]It just goes up and up and up.
[62:42.31]One of those things is over here, apparently.
[62:44.65]It's a secret.
[62:51.35]Might as well just get it.
[62:56.05]Might as well just- there's three!
[62:57.65]Fuck, okay.
[62:59.67]I gotta utilize these more often.
[63:03.39]I'm not utilizing those to the fullest potential.
[63:10.76]Fuck, this is still going up!
[63:14.00]We're still going up!
[63:16.60]Ugh!
[63:18.16]Ooh boy, I think that's somebody's asshole.
[63:21.44]Yep.
[63:22.50]That's a guy, that's a turkey lying face down.
[63:25.43]Those are his legs and that's his asshole.
[63:27.91]Wow, there's somebody in his asshole.
[63:30.45]There's a person in this person's asshole.
[63:32.53]Ooh, tiny thing, you climb high, seek then knowledge of these lands.
[63:37.99]This ashen place is grave, a worm once told.
[63:41.13]It came to die, but what is death for that ancient being?
[63:43.53]More transformation methods.
[63:45.53]This failed kingdom is a product of being spawned from this event.
[63:50.87]Ugh.
[63:52.33]Is the guy's face gonna turn around?
[63:56.43]Hmm.
[64:03.07]Anything else?
[64:08.35]Too many limbs.
[64:11.35]This guy has a lot to say.
[64:14.37]Mm-hmm.
[64:21.80]Before I dream this guy.
[64:22.98]Alright, we're going to dream this guy and see what happens.
[64:33.09]One prefers its mind not be pride.
[64:34.69]It's rather unsettling, rather invasive.
[64:43.13]Mola, I hope you get out of there.
[64:45.45]Oh.
[64:52.26]So he's just all the way up there, and that's all that's up there.
[64:59.20]Ow, fuck.
[65:03.03]What else is over here?
[65:08.53]What are you guys typing?
[65:09.41]One, one, one, one, one, one?
[65:10.85]What are you guys wanting?
[65:12.45]One?
[65:12.61]One?
[65:13.81]One?
[65:13.95]I'm, like, not paying attention.
[65:17.16]I'm losing all these soul hearts because I'm just fucking looking at the chat room.
[65:25.30]It's all gone.
[65:26.98]All of it's gone.
[65:28.16]Let's just pretend we didn't come over here.
[65:30.32]Might as well, right?
[65:31.74]I never came this way.
[65:34.32]I found the guy stuck in an asshole.
[65:36.36]And that's it.
[65:43.08]Bench is all the way over there.
[65:45.83]I need to go over there and sit on that bench.
[65:47.21]Let's just go this way.
[65:51.47]Let's get there.
[65:54.21]So I can update my journal.
[65:56.33]Oh, what?
[65:56.71]This is on the spot.
[65:58.59]Ooh, really?
[66:00.69]Bench, huh?
[66:02.84]Where?
[66:09.02]I think you can fool me.
[66:12.26]Think you can fool me?
[66:14.68]Wanderer's journal.
[66:16.10]And a bench.
[66:20.70]Interesting.
[66:22.64]Interesting stuff.
[66:26.77]Can't get out of here.
[66:31.05]Oh.
[66:36.99]There's jermaEarth.
[66:43.61]You missed that one.
[66:47.43]Watch out for the stalactites.
[66:48.59]I guess I could just super dash.
[66:52.41]Come here.
[66:54.79]Come here.
[67:05.34]Should I pee before this?
[67:06.78]This is a boss fight.
[67:07.62]Should I pee?
[67:08.52]Should I pee first?
[67:11.32]No, I'm not gonna pee first.
[67:14.50]So you'd pursue the deeper truth.
[67:15.76]It isn't the one, the weak ones.
[67:18.06]Here we go!
[67:20.44]It's time for the real fight.
[67:21.81]The fight of your life.
[67:23.83]I'm not gonna hold back.
[67:24.97]My needle is lethal and I'll feel no shame in weakening you.
[67:28.97]Show me you can accept this kingdom's past and claim responsibility for its future.
[67:32.07]Anime voice acting!
[67:38.06]ANIME VOICE ACTOR!
[67:42.54]Okay, no fucking around, let's beat this.
[67:57.21]I'm like, this fucking blizzard is fucking with my head!
[67:59.49]Seriously, the blizzard's fucking with my head!
[68:02.53]I can't do this with the bliz- Can I turn off graphics?
[68:05.29]I can't do this with the snow.
[68:07.58]I feel like this is in my face, like I'm playing VR.
[68:09.52]I don't even know what's happening.
[68:24.95]There's too much shit on the fucking screen.
[68:30.19]I really don't like this.
[68:38.83]I don't even care.
[68:44.19]I'll heal.
[68:46.40]He's gonna play easy.
[69:07.26]She's saying, I got it.
[69:14.56]Whoa.
[69:18.16]That's new.
[69:18.70]Can I break them?
[69:19.21]Okay, I can.
[69:20.17]Can I knock them?
[69:20.61]Oh, shh.
[69:21.17]Quiet.
[69:21.53]Stop talking.
[69:22.05]I can't play games and talk.
[69:23.07]Fuck.
[69:32.31]I just tried to block right there, guys.
[69:34.53]I was holding down R2 to block.
[69:40.47]Okay.
[69:43.11]How do I turn off graphics?
[69:47.11]I can't.
[69:52.35]I wish I could turn off my graphics card.
[69:55.03]Can I play this game on like a fucking Commodore 64?
[69:56.85]Where's my corpse?
[70:16.14]I gotta turn my monitor off.
[70:17.78]I hope I... Okay, thank God that I can just do this and beat her eventually.
[70:21.14]I don't have to worry about this.
[70:26.14]Alright, let me get it this time.
[70:27.22]Those things can be hit.
[70:28.12]I don't know.
[70:28.38]I was holding down R2 to block.
[70:32.15]I gotta... Hold on.
[70:32.79]I gotta unbutton my pants.
[70:36.93]There we go.
[70:38.41]That's what the fucking problem was.
[70:39.91]I don't know why I'm wearing these tight-ass jeans right now.
[70:42.83]Wait a second.
[70:43.69]I'm taking them off.
[70:47.94]am I wearing these for I'm wearing like tight skin tight jeans no wonder I'm like having issues I'm like my dick circulation is at like eight percent honest to god I can feel the blood flowing back into my penis right now and it's causing problems
[71:13.08]Okay, hold on.
[71:14.36]Hold on.
[71:14.78]I might have to redo this again.
[71:16.80]I've got to just fuck it around.
[71:18.10]Alright, no more fucking around.
[71:19.44]Let's be... Hold on.
[71:42.76]Can you block that, really?
[71:55.51]There we go.
[71:55.89]Alright, we're good.
[71:58.43]She's gotta get rid of these dumb things when she puts them out.
[72:03.53]She just dashed to the exact same fucking spot that I did.
[72:05.81]Really?
[72:06.19]Fuck you.
[72:11.87]What am I doing?
[72:19.54]Okay.
[72:20.86]I'm just not prepared for this at all.
[72:27.42]Maybe I should just leave one.
[72:39.36]If I leave one, maybe she doesn't do them.
[72:41.22]Oh, no, that doesn't make... Fuck, I thought she was dashing.
[72:50.83]Alright, this thing... That thing's kinda... This thing kinda sucks.
[73:00.75]Takes too long.
[73:07.83]It takes too long.
[73:11.63]I'd rather have this soul charger thing.
[73:14.11]If I'm completely honest.
[73:16.97]There she goes.
[73:27.61]Come on, heal.
[73:50.83]Fuck, I thought she was dashing.
[73:51.91]Shit.
[74:31.07]Come on.
[74:38.26]Ah, thank god.
[74:39.62]I just lucked out right there bad.
[74:41.12]No, I didn't.
[74:41.84]I'm in deep shit.
[75:05.96]Come on, what the fuck?
[75:07.56]Got it.
[75:15.00]Whoo!
[75:28.23]Oh, I must turn my webcam on.
[75:30.95]Wow.
[75:31.43]I would have just got banned from twitch.tv.
[75:34.39]I seriously would have got banned from Twitch.
[75:37.87]Like Spencer, you would have had to ban me.
[75:41.12]My pants are like down at my knees right now.
[75:43.82]And I'm like sitting near my underwear.
[75:45.04]Half underwear.
[75:50.34]I just got banned from this website forever.
[75:58.04]So strong, you could do it.
[75:59.42]If you have the will.
[76:02.69]I did have the will.
[76:04.01]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[76:09.23]Then do it.
[76:09.69]Ghost of Holoness, head onward.
[76:10.87]Burn that mark upon your shell and claim yourself as king.
[76:15.07]I'm going to have to fight her again, aren't I?
[76:21.57]I'm not sure if I like... You know, the...
[76:26.86]This beehive charm, as much as I don't like it, I feel like it saved my ass like once or twice.
[76:35.77]And maybe that's worth it just to have that one opportunity where it might save your ass.
[76:41.81]You guys tell me I wasn't really paying that much attention to my health as much as I was trying to concentrate on fighting.
[76:46.99]Was there an opportunity where that like saved my life?
[76:49.26]What do you guys think?
[76:59.06]Cast off shell.
[77:04.51]Chop sucks.
[77:06.39]It did.
[77:07.71]Quick, quick Fergus.
[77:08.97]Quick, quick Fergus.
[77:11.63]Quick Fergus would have been better.
[77:13.65]Seemed pretty useless.
[77:22.70]Now you basically stop dealing damage altogether in order to change, like, yeah.
[77:28.56]What's this?
[77:30.74]King's brand.
[77:32.46]Holiness shall recognize a new ruler.
[77:34.04]The kingdom's gates will open.
[77:40.66]Okay.
[77:46.87]Can I go in this shell?
[77:48.11]Apparently not.
[77:51.25]Oh, this whole place is collapsing!
[77:56.21]Did I do it?
[78:01.97]I don't think I did it.
[78:03.79]Oh, I did.
[78:04.67]She saved my life.
[78:07.49]I'm a nice friend.
[78:09.85]Thank you, friend.
[78:10.45]Okay.
[78:13.09]Did I win?
[78:16.87]I got the king's seal.
[78:17.94]I guess that opens up one of those doors?
[78:20.84]The king's seal, maybe?
[78:22.80]Hold on.
[78:23.18]One second.
[78:37.87]I'm gonna take this opportunity to go to the bathroom.
[78:40.35]So, my pants are already down.
[78:42.36]Might as well, like, use that opportunity to go pee.
[78:44.58]So, I'll be right back.
[78:46.48]Take a pee break.
[79:24.10]Thank you.
[80:33.68]you
[81:25.94]Thank you.
[83:19.65]Hi.
[83:21.09]Oh.
[83:22.87]Otto, get in here.
[83:26.06]You stay in here, dog.
[83:32.20]There you go.
[83:34.98]Oh, I feel a thousand times better.
[83:38.34]Got a nice refill.
[83:46.39]My pants are back on, so it's okay.
[83:48.69]I have to say that.
[83:52.01]Hey, Hamster King, a few minutes ago, gave five bucks and says, I just bought this game because of you.
[83:58.33]Well, it's a very good game.
[84:00.03]So I'm glad that you are enjoying it.
[84:04.07]And I guess I can't go that way anymore.
[84:12.12]So this seal...
[84:15.95]The seal I can now take.
[84:19.49]I never drop down there.
[84:21.09]Just to go look down there.
[84:28.82]What am I drinking?
[84:29.56]I'm drinking coffee right now.
[84:31.94]I know.
[84:33.44]I know.
[84:34.58]I'm drinking fucking coffee at like 9.30 at night.
[84:39.90]Trust me when I say I know that's a fucking bad idea, but we're trying to reset our sleep schedule.
[84:46.85]That's what we're doing.
[84:49.55]And might as well just see... I guess I've already done everything.
[84:54.37]So what is that seal for?
[84:55.47]The kingdom seal.
[85:00.57]I mean, the king's pass?
[85:05.86]What king do I need to... Actually, I could read the damn thing, couldn't I?
[85:11.83]Makes sense, right?
[85:13.29]Why not read the damn thing?
[85:15.73]Oh, rancid egg raiser.
[85:16.81]King's brand.
[85:21.38]Huh.
[85:23.38]Doesn't really say anything.
[85:25.50]Oh, I'm sorry.
[85:25.96]I don't hear.
[85:26.24]You can lie in this bed.
[85:29.53]Lie in this bed, dog.
[85:31.83]Yeah.
[85:32.79]I'll move his paw.
[85:33.61]There you go.
[85:40.92]Alright, let me see again.
[85:45.71]So, we've got... Down here... But there's also a train that I didn't go in.
[85:58.17]Where's the other tram?
[86:00.86]Right there.
[86:03.78]Now, do I take the tram that's in... The Forgotten Crossroads?
[86:07.30]Or do I go down to the basin?
[86:08.56]Hmm.
[86:14.25]I guess I'll go down.
[86:20.89]Trying to, like, avoid getting hit.
[86:22.10]And I'm getting hit anyways.
[86:25.26]So, let's go down.
[86:28.72]Yeah, I guess I'm just gonna go left and down.
[86:34.38]You guys wanna see the dog?
[86:38.37]I can show you the dog for a second.
[86:39.99]You guys want a dog cam?
[86:40.87]Alright.
[86:44.94]Here's your dog cam.
[86:45.96]He's currently just, like, sleeping over here.
[86:52.82]There he is.
[86:54.64]Whoops.
[86:59.09]There you go.
[87:02.01]He's just hanging out over there.
[87:04.63]This dog cam has been brought to you by... twitch.tv!

[87:28.27]Banned?
[87:28.61]Why?
[87:28.73]Because my dog's naked?
[87:30.53]Oh, shit.
[87:30.95]My dog's naked.
[87:31.87]Uh-oh.
[87:32.53]I'm gonna be in big trouble.
[87:33.95]Alright.
[87:36.99]Speaking of big trouble, I'm getting myself in big trouble here.
[87:39.61]I'm taking so many hits just trying to speed through this.
[87:51.51]Do it again.
[87:51.95]No.
[87:52.87]No, I will never show my dog on camera again.
[88:00.24]I'm just kidding.
[88:01.50]Of course I will.
[88:07.26]What happened?
[88:11.94]I just hit like a... A fucking like... Kaizo Mario block.
[88:15.54]What is it called?
[88:18.16]Is it Kaizo?
[88:19.26]Kaizo...
[88:22.63]A kaizo block, right?
[88:23.93]That's what I just hit.
[88:24.55]I never went up here.
[88:29.20]Maybe I did, and I'm just too stupid.
[88:35.58]I wonder if I'm stupid.
[88:40.38]I guess I never went up this way.
[88:47.62]That should be an instant kill on these little shits.
[88:51.24]Come on, no, really.
[89:00.55]Wait, I'm snooping!
[89:02.25]What are you talking about?
[89:03.11]I'm snooping!
[89:18.59]Ah!
[89:18.83]What's the Mario called?
[89:19.83]What's the Mario one called?
[89:20.75]The one where it's really hard and there's like super hidden scary blocks that just fuck with you.
[89:37.57]Anyway, to boost my damage, you have to upgrade your nail, which can only be upgraded with a certain ore that you have to find and money.
[89:46.88]I just did one of the upgrades last stream.
[89:52.98]I had it right.
[89:53.48]Yeah, I had it right.
[89:54.12]What are you guys talking about?
[89:55.22]I had it right.
[89:55.68]I do have to go back to Dirtmouth to go in the centipede room, though.
[90:06.84]Neat.
[90:14.66]Okay, we're just going for this.
[90:15.66]This is easier.
[90:18.70]I think there's a dance party going on in here.
[90:20.74]Whoa!
[90:24.84]Another warrior finds their way to the fair coliseum.
[90:28.52]Ours is the final destination for all seeking trials of intense and deadly combat.
[90:32.96]All I want us to do is place a remark upon their trial board of choice, and lo, the area's gate will open.
[90:38.48]There's a small fee attached to each trial, but I'm sure as a skilled combatant as yourself, you'll have accrued a wealth of geo.
[90:44.94]Now, before you draw your nail and rush eagerly to battle, I'll offer you one quick word of advice.
[90:49.66]Make a contribution and you can enter the trial of the warrior.
[90:52.32]No.
[90:52.40]He told me to go downstairs first.
[91:19.47]Like, I'm supposed to be going down there first, right?
[91:25.15]I was told, come down here first, don't do anything stupid.
[91:29.10]That's what he said.
[91:32.94]So, where is it?
[91:33.38]Is there a bench down here?
[91:36.88]Yes.
[91:40.28]And there's that stupid asshole.
[91:45.28]And, call a save of...
[91:47.39]Coliseum of fools.
[91:49.65]Fools?
[91:50.33]Stupid!
[91:54.09]Okay, there's the Coliseum.
[91:56.81]Alright, I have a save point right here.
[92:01.58]I might as well give this a go.
[92:02.58]Why not, right?
[92:03.26]Let's talk to Zeke, whatever his name is.
[92:06.58]Zote.
[92:08.76]Come to laugh me out.
[92:12.40]He wanted to be locked in here.
[92:13.42]Just by all means, release me into your arena.
[92:18.10]Life ender, your laughter will turn... Can I finally fucking kill this guy?
[92:26.00]Like, honest to God, do I get to actually kill this guy now?
[92:29.41]I hope so.
[92:32.33]The Coliseum of Stupid!
[92:36.17]What the hell's in that room?
[92:41.58]Oh, let's inspect.
[92:43.51]Not so fast.
[92:43.95]That trial is closed.
[92:45.79]Oh.
[92:46.95]We have to open up each one.
[92:48.21]Let's try it.
[92:50.51]100 Geo.
[92:50.85]Easy.
[92:54.75]Doink.
[92:56.52]That was a pretty sick... Doink.
[92:57.96]The clown.
[93:01.12]Trial of warriors.
[93:01.84]Fight for Geo and a charm notch.
[93:04.18]Yep.
[93:05.64]Alright.
[93:06.02]Let's wipe off my sweaty fucking disgusting hands.
[93:10.07]Here we go.
[93:12.17]Go.
[93:18.11]The Trial of the Grand Crusader.
[93:19.57]I remember this from World of Warcraft.
[93:21.91]Just wait.
[93:22.41]At the very end, Anub'Arak comes out.
[93:25.07]And it's a huge, big deal that Anub'Arak is back.
[93:30.53]Colosseum of... Fools!
[93:34.21]And you got like the wicked Board King.
[93:36.46]Board King.

[94:23.95]Come on, bait it out.
[94:24.60]Let's go.
[94:25.82]Come on.
[94:26.90]Really?
[94:27.18]You're fucking gonna queue it up right there, you two assholes.
[94:31.46]Fuck these dumbass bugs.
[94:38.95]I got one.
[94:39.37]Oh, there goes one finally.
[94:45.15]Uh, I'm gonna just do this.
[94:47.95]Just heal up.
[94:48.87]Just before I- It's probably gonna have to fight three.
[94:51.17]I'm just gonna be a pain in the ass.
[94:54.61]God, just fucking die.
[94:55.83]Just please die!
[95:06.34]This one's fairly easy.
[95:08.12]Although, I don't know what this is happening.
[95:12.82]I don't know what this is happening.
[95:15.90]Can anyone teach me how to speak proper English?
[95:18.86]I don't know what this is happening.
[95:19.80]I don't know.
[95:23.16]This is actually easy.
[95:23.99]I don't even have to be on the ground.
[95:27.21]Wait till I heal.
[95:34.60]This one guy didn't come down.
[95:36.20]He forgot there was a fight going on.
[95:41.60]Alright.
[95:46.48]Hammer brother.
[95:46.98]He's got longer range.
[95:52.83]I'm just gonna keep doing that.
[96:01.85]Who's next?
[96:02.37]Two of those?
[96:02.79]Two of those guys?
[96:03.77]Yup.
[96:08.50]I'm getting greedy here.
[96:09.48]Calm down.
[96:12.50]Wait till I heal that piece.
[96:18.47]Oh, fucking whatever.
[96:19.31]Just kill these fucking things.
[96:20.47]Ow.
[96:35.60]Ooh, gotta get rid of these guys first, for sure.
[96:39.68]Oh, there's only those guys.
[96:40.73]Ah, fuck.
[96:46.91]No, I'm gonna give this a second.
[96:48.47]I just want this to heal and get full health for the next batch of random enemies, whatever they may be.
[96:52.80]You know, whatever they may be.
[96:54.92]Okay, I'm good.
[97:06.85]Come on.
[97:09.07]Wow, this floor is fucking lava.
[97:19.06]The bee charm's got to fucking go.
[97:22.30]Bee charm is not doing me any favors.
[97:23.88]It really ain't.
[97:26.10]Just causing problems.
[97:28.11]I'm too afraid to... Here's what's happening.
[97:30.39]I'm too af... What's happening?
[97:32.65]I'm too scared to heal because I think I'm gonna get healed.
[97:35.71]So I don't heal.
[97:36.87]And then I don't.
[97:38.53]It's fairly, fairly irritating.
[97:39.93]Oh, shit.
[97:54.27]Wow!
[97:54.73]He just spawned on top of me.
[97:55.63]Fuck that.
[97:55.87]See what I'm talking... See what I'm saying?
[98:12.18]Yeah, the bee charm will be good if I could heal the next one forward, you know what I mean?
[98:18.99]Actually, I'm kind of screwed right now.
[98:22.77]I gotta, like, really get rid of this guy.
[98:25.95]He needs to move to the other side of the platform.
[98:27.61]Come on, get out of the way!
[98:28.41]Okay, there we go.
[98:38.85]Heal this.
[98:40.70]I'm gonna go safe.
[98:42.16]Be safe about this.
[98:43.22]Okay, throw one of your stupid things at me, please.
[98:54.88]Okay, what's next?
[99:00.06]Um... Floor's moving around.
[99:03.92]What is this?
[99:05.56]Um... Oh, fuck.
[99:07.69]Okay.
[99:10.64]Actually, not that bad.
[99:12.28]No, no, it just got worse.
[99:19.74]It's gonna give me one of those big guys, ain't it?
[99:21.54]That's gonna be terrible.
[99:28.04]Oh, shit.
[99:29.36]Random bees.
[99:31.95]Did I win?
[99:32.73]Nope.
[99:33.47]Huge one.
[99:34.89]Shit.
[99:39.09]Come on.
[99:44.08]I'll do this over and over again.
[99:45.06]That's fine.
[99:45.50]I don't know why I keep going for that.
[99:49.90]Why do I keep even trying to do that?
[99:52.08]See?
[99:52.34]I just tried to do it again.
[99:53.79]Like, you dummy.
[99:55.29]You're not gonna get it.
[99:56.63]It flies too high.
[99:57.85]Just fight him.
[99:59.01]Here come more bugs.
[100:05.48]Come on, do the dive.
[100:12.28]There we go.
[100:13.78]I win.
[100:14.06]I get my notch, right?
[100:19.58]Or is that not it?
[100:20.48]Is there more?
[100:21.78]Oh, there's more.
[100:26.94]There's more.
[100:27.50]It's a long-ass fight.
[100:30.50]Shit.
[100:33.23]The guy with the fucking shield.
[100:35.65]Oh my god.
[100:57.56]He goes... Shit!
[101:06.10]Get out of my way!
[101:08.16]No, it's gonna spawn another one, isn't it?
[101:09.42]Oh shit!
[101:16.46]Ew, fuck!
[101:19.44]Oh, I tried to double jump it, it didn't work!
[101:30.87]How much more of this shit do I have to do?
[101:32.55]Oh, come on.
[101:46.28]I missed shit.
[101:47.96]Ah!
[101:49.93]Heal, you fucker.
[101:50.97]Oh my god.
[101:52.29]Throw the beach arm in the fucking trash.
[101:55.51]For real.
[101:55.99]I hate this thing with a passion.
[101:57.75]It's coming off Eve fucking immediately.
[101:59.25]That thing should cost two.
[102:05.40]It sucks so much.
[102:06.22]Can I, like, can I be done?
[102:15.78]What the hell is going on?
[102:21.14]Can I just be done with this now?
[102:28.37]Eve.
[102:29.07]Eve.
[102:29.47]I can't even say it.
[102:33.45]Eve fucking immediately.
[102:36.61]What the fuck?
[102:39.59]It's not worth it.
[102:42.08]I don't even want the notch.
[102:49.88]Fucking shy guys.
[103:03.57]There's more.
[103:04.95]Oh my god.
[103:06.47]Two huge ones.
[103:10.00]I'm getting impatient.
[103:10.78]Stop getting impatient.
[103:17.14]You see how fucking impatient I'm getting?
[103:18.99]Please, Jeremy.
[103:41.53]Okay.
[103:43.01]More?
[103:44.45]More?
[103:46.57]More.
[103:48.86]More.
[103:49.94]This is the real fight.
[103:51.34]No.
[103:55.63]Okay.
[103:57.39]It is him!
[103:57.79]I gotta fight him!
[103:58.23]Get him!
[104:06.74]Don't let him play.
[104:07.94]Don't let him play the game.
[104:11.10]Just do Street Fighter.
[104:12.94]If I learned anything from watching Evo, you don't let the guy do anything.
[104:16.06]You just combo him, and I just Street Fighted that guy, and I won.
[104:21.82]Wow.
[104:24.44]Wow.
[104:25.78]Wow.
[104:26.60]Wow.
[104:28.02]Wow.
[104:28.30]Wow.
[104:28.42]Wow.
[104:30.80]Okay.
[104:34.28]Did it.
[104:37.15]Charm Notch.
[104:37.97]Nice.
[104:46.03]Go on, Curse.
[104:46.73]Scurry away, lest I humiliate you further.
[104:52.49]Even if you let him hit you, he can't do any damage.
[104:55.01]Okay.
[104:56.91]Alright, well.
[104:58.07]That's a new Notch.
[105:00.94]Somebody get out of here.
[105:06.04]Okay.
[105:15.59]Um... There's another one.
[105:18.31]Welcome back.
[105:19.27]Make a contribution to the trial of Conqueror.
[105:23.77]Yeah.
[105:28.52]I hope... These get long...
[105:32.07]So what do you get for beating this one?
[105:33.07]I'm curious.
[105:34.89]Fight for Geo and a rare medal.
[105:50.68]And then I might be able to go... Okay, I think I have to do this.
[105:53.16]The third one is extremely long.
[105:55.80]Well...
[105:57.46]Let's go take a look at my belt now, because I have another notch.
[106:01.26]Alright.
[106:02.38]The beehive.
[106:02.98]Get the fuck out of here.
[106:04.96]Beehive sucks.
[106:09.39]I kind of want this.
[106:12.87]The greatly increased range.
[106:13.89]Then I have enough for two.
[106:19.15]Dangerous situations.
[106:23.29]Now, should I remove this horse room and put on the focus?
[106:29.58]Soul Eater.
[106:32.84]Dash Master I could do.
[106:33.98]What's another one that's two?
[106:35.00]Soul Catcher.
[106:37.50]That's... I guess I don't need that right now.
[106:45.88]So, what can I do?
[106:46.88]Shaman Stone.
[106:47.74]Quick Focus.
[106:49.08]I think that's good.
[107:01.26]I think that's alright.
[107:01.96]I mean, Spore Shroom is not really... Baldr's Shell?
[107:06.46]Let me see.
[107:08.63]Where's Baldr's Shell?
[107:14.09]There it is.
[107:24.46]Yeah, the Spore Shroom.
[107:26.30]We'll try the Grub Song.
[107:29.06]Gain soul when taking damage.
[107:32.87]I think I like that so far.
[107:34.05]I think that's good.
[107:37.65]Alright.
[107:38.27]So now I have increased range and I get my quick focus back.
[107:42.61]Here's the worst part about putting on the long nail.
[107:45.45]I'm going to get so used to this that I'll never... Here's my concern, guys.
[107:49.10]Here's my concern.
[107:49.70]I'm going to air my concern.
[107:53.16]I'm going to get so used to using it like this that ever taking this off will be a problem and I'll never be able to take it off.
[108:01.66]We're gonna have to keep this on for the rest of the time I play the game.
[108:05.36]But, whatever.
[108:06.22]It's a problem we'll have to deal with.
[108:07.40]Um, let's go.
[108:19.99]Let's try it.
[108:20.37]Here we go.
[108:26.51]That's exactly how it worked with me.
[108:27.73]I can't take it off.
[108:28.69]I know, right?
[108:30.19]Well, here we go.
[108:31.53]Let's see how long this one is.
[108:36.30]Mm-hmm.
[108:44.24]This will give us a Pale Ore and hopefully enough Geo to upgrade my nail again.
[108:48.84]So I better be good.
[108:51.08]I better do good.
[108:52.02]Oh, that's a new enemy.
[109:06.86]Ooh, that goes even further too, doesn't it?
[109:08.64]Yeah, we won't be taking this off anytime soon.
[109:35.51]This is so much better.
[109:36.39]The game is so much better with this thing on.
[109:43.55]Life is so much easier with this fucking charm on.
[110:01.72]Seriously.
[110:08.85]Pogo the guy.
[110:09.51]Alright, we good?
[110:18.74]What's next?
[110:19.26]Oh, he spawned right on top of me.
[110:21.48]That sure was fair.
[110:42.67]Shit.
[110:48.05]I gotta be careful here.
[110:51.85]Wow, wow!
[110:55.43]Oh my god, it's just too much shit on the screen.
[110:59.80]I just don't even know where I'm gonna spawn.
[111:01.10]That sucks.
[111:05.08]When it gets like this and you've landed on the ground, there's no... Where the hell am I gonna even spawn?
[111:12.69]Where's my stuff?
[111:17.46]Can I just go up here and get my ship?
[111:20.50]Oh, no.
[111:21.12]Uh...
[111:49.52]I don't think quick focus.
[112:01.49]I feel like I don't have very much time.
[112:02.93]You know, I feel like I don't have enough time to really heal in that room.
[112:13.39]Especially when that starts happening.
[112:27.09]No charms get good.
[112:31.81]There's no place that could respawn you in that room where you weren't in a hitbox.
[112:34.49]Yeah, that just sucks.
[112:35.51]You just can't land on the spikes.
[112:57.43]No, that's not going to do anything for me.
[113:02.64]No, we're going to go back to what we were just doing.
[113:04.02]Although, I'm going to put on the... Take this one off.
[113:08.84]We'll do what we were doing before, but I... We're going back to the spore.
[113:19.38]I feel like in that enclosed area, it will actually do me some good.
[113:26.29]Whatever, let's go get my shit.
[113:34.95]Wait.
[113:35.23]Oh, he's right here?
[113:36.99]Oh, okay, that's good.
[113:37.77]Thank god he spawns right here.
[113:43.37]We'll try this.
[113:46.10]That room just gets really overwhelming.
[113:49.26]Is the issue.
[113:51.16]It gets overwhelming.
[113:57.14]Have to just be on top of my game and get rid of a couple of those shy guys before they all start spawning.
[114:05.95]The Spore was getting some nice wallbangs before.
[114:08.19]Yeah, I just... If I'm going to be healing, I might as well use it.
[114:13.25]Especially considering that those things fly around.
[114:16.58]Let's just get through this.
[114:18.04]Let's get through this quick.
[114:22.77]I think I'm the big guy, another guy... Get rid of the fly guy first.
[114:38.65]Okay, here we go.
[114:48.07]Back to square one.
[114:51.22]You know what else I want to put on here?
[114:52.30]Hold on.
[114:54.48]I'll tell you in a second.
[114:56.24]The one that makes it so I don't move around when I'm swinging in the air.
[114:59.76]That's causing me a ton of problems.
[115:01.85]What is that one called?
[115:02.93]I have it, right?
[115:03.47]Because that's bouncing me around in places I don't want to be bounced around.
[115:11.15]Especially in a tiny little spot like this.
[115:19.94]Let's be careful here.
[115:28.80]Shit, I need to pogo that guy.
[115:30.72]Come here.
[115:34.13]He can go up with that, fuck.
[115:44.47]Alright, here we go.
[115:50.44]Those guys gotta go first.
[115:55.44]Anybody that shoots a projectile's gotta go.
[116:01.97]Shit.
[116:07.66]Yeah, that's better.
[116:08.58]That's doing work.
[116:09.46]Let's just chill for a second.
[116:10.38]I don't kill anything but one of these big, the shy guys.
[116:18.32]They have such a fucking odd pattern.
[116:21.12]Fuck me.
[116:26.34]This gets so messy.
[116:33.09]Good.
[116:33.87]Oh, Spore.
[116:34.51]Spore is killing it right now.
[116:37.23]Spore is fucking killing it.
[116:42.65]It's so hard.
[116:43.35]The gooey shit lasts a long time, too.
[116:50.65]Okay, here we go.
[116:56.30]That was annoying.
[116:58.76]I wanted to heal right there.
[117:05.50]Whoa!
[117:06.14]What the fuck?
[117:09.20]Really?
[117:11.48]Didn't even give me a second there.
[117:12.64]Oh shit.
[117:16.76]Okay, there's no spikes.
[117:26.81]I'm just getting like fucking freaked out right now.
[117:28.93]Calm down.
[117:38.11]Three hits for these things?
[117:48.72]I've never... Holy shit.
[117:52.86]Okay, not a big deal.
[117:53.88]They just jump higher.
[118:01.56]Oh, okay.
[118:02.26]Fuck.
[118:02.60]How the fuck?
[118:14.85]We good?
[118:20.73]What?
[118:22.33]Did I get it?
[118:22.77]Or is this a joke?
[118:24.67]It's a joke.
[118:25.05]Hey, I knew it was a joke.
[118:25.95]You're gonna, like, pull a joke on me.
[118:32.12]I'll go this guy first, get him out of the way.
[118:38.30]Any other spawning?
[118:51.32]What the fuck?
[118:51.90]What are you leaning over here for, you dickhead?
[118:53.56]Come over here and get fucking spored.
[119:25.31]Ooh, that was close.
[119:28.13]Big bug?
[119:29.15]Nope, no.
[119:29.51]Just one of these guys.
[119:30.93]Just keep him locked in the corner.
[119:34.63]Come on.
[119:34.95]What do we got?
[119:35.41]Another bouncer?
[119:36.61]Nope.
[119:39.49]I really gotta get above you.
[119:44.93]Spikes.
[119:47.08]Oh, shit in my draws.
[119:48.56]Really?
[119:58.38]Just gotta stay up.
[120:00.52]Very important.
[120:01.20]Oh fuck, they can go up too.
[120:11.04]Alright, I gotta calm the fuck down here.
[120:12.82]Calm the fuck down, Jeremy.
[120:14.16]Really.
[121:07.51]What the fuck are these things?
[121:08.56]Alright, I know, I got the pattern, I got the pattern.
[121:17.92]She's right underneath him.
[121:23.44]Holy shit.
[121:41.28]Get the spore activated over here.
[121:42.74]Come on.
[121:46.47]Perfect.
[121:47.37]Perfect.
[121:48.43]Perfect.
[121:49.47]Perfect.
[122:03.12]Dude, whoever said spore wasn't a good idea.
[122:05.67]Oh, that was a great idea.
[122:28.29]This is so intense, it's just so long.
[122:34.88]What do we got?
[122:35.48]Fuck.
[123:01.88]Oh, right in the fucking worst spot.
[123:17.96]I gotta get the pattern here.
[123:35.38]Stay far away.
[123:38.44]No funny business here.
[123:39.38]Just fucking get it done.
[123:40.24]Right in the spore.
[123:53.24]There we go.
[124:02.33]It's alright.
[124:02.73]Calm down.
[124:13.03]Alright, we're good.
[124:37.16]Fuck you, you fucker.
[124:52.29]This shit can head so badly.
[125:01.90]He's taking a lot of hits!
[125:05.00]Why no charge strike?
[125:05.88]You know, that's a good idea.
[125:06.76]He's dead.
[125:08.40]Alright.
[125:09.00]Is that it?
[125:12.08]Of course it's not.
[125:16.75]Alright.
[125:17.45]That's it!
[125:18.05]Ooh, I did it!
[125:18.63]Yes!
[125:25.70]Palor?
[125:27.18]Yes!
[125:28.36]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
[125:31.94]I can now upgrade the Nail again.
[125:33.20]Good.
[125:38.60]That could have been a disaster with them still alive.
[125:43.15]Yeah, why did the first one die so fast?
[125:45.71]I don't get it.
[125:48.83]That seems easier than the first.
[125:49.97]It kind of was.
[125:50.77]Except, no, that's not true.
[125:52.83]The, uh...
[125:54.98]That one... That part right there with the two big guys.
[125:58.06]That could have just thrown me off completely.
[126:02.03]But... The part with those floating shy guys that shoot the ooze.
[126:08.35]With the spikes on the ground.
[126:10.39]That shit was... I didn't like that at all.
[126:13.27]Alright, so... Let's see.
[126:19.02]Oh.
[126:19.66]The contribution.
[126:20.34]How much is it?
[126:20.74]Okay.
[126:23.00]Trial of the Fool.
[126:24.66]800.
[126:25.60]Just unlock it.
[126:26.12]Might as well.
[126:30.59]I'm just curious what you get.
[126:31.47]Because I need 2,000 for the... Let's see.
[126:35.81]Fight for Geo and the glory of being a fool.
[126:40.84]Well, let me just... Give me one second.
[126:43.60]I'll try it.
[126:46.54]I don't know.
[126:47.08]I'll give it one good go.
[126:52.64]One good go.
[126:54.88]I currently like the setup I have right now anyway, so.
[127:01.32]I still can't beat Trial 3 and I've beaten everything else in the whole game.
[127:05.13]Really.
[127:07.55]Well, let's just see what it is.
[127:08.65]Here we go.
[127:11.35]Here's like the super hard trial.
[127:17.16]It's worth a try, but it's really tricky.
[127:18.64]Well, whatever.
[127:21.87]I just want to see what it's all about.
[127:29.70]Upgrade the nail?
[127:30.34]Well, I will.
[127:32.46]If I lose, I lose.
[127:33.26]It's not a big deal.
[127:33.92]Let's get going.
[127:36.90]I can upgrade the nail and come back.
[127:38.02]I just want to see how hard it is.
[127:44.31]That guy spawned right there.
[127:45.19]That was bullshit.
[127:46.93]I couldn't even see that guy.
[127:47.77]He was behind the giant slug person.
[127:54.19]Oh shit, I didn't know you existed.
[128:01.10]Alright, you gotta get the fuck out of here, man.
[128:10.92]You are just being a no- God damn, fuck off.
[128:27.94]Come on over here, boys.
[128:51.72]Spikes!
[128:53.68]Okay, they get hurt by the spikes too.
[128:55.21]That's good to know.
[129:03.66]I can't see.
[129:05.02]Holy fuck, I couldn't even see a damn thing.
[129:16.16]Take my time with this.
[129:23.71]Oh god, take my time.
[129:25.43]I need a longer nail.
[129:31.98]Seriously, will you fly over here?
[129:33.57]Will you fucking fly over here, please?
[129:36.94]You stupid shit enemy.
[130:10.08]I love how I'm learning new enemies.
[130:11.28]These weird, like, coral reef crabs.
[130:17.55]Holy shit in my underwear.
[130:19.11]Okay, there's still ground.
[130:35.44]What am I doing?
[130:36.24]These guys jump.
[130:36.92]Why would I just do that?
[130:50.42]Trial of the Grand Crusader.
[130:57.31]What's next?
[130:57.75]Come on.
[131:15.62]Shit.
[131:16.98]Ah!
[131:18.87]Come on, Spore!
[131:19.53]I need you right now!
[131:20.23]Woof!
[131:41.31]Whoa!
[131:42.29]Can I kill these things?
[131:44.46]Oh shit.
[131:45.86]I don't think I can kill these.
[131:46.67]Do these things die?
[131:47.85]I've never had to fight one before.
[132:02.72]Let it do its work.
[132:05.00]Thank god.
[132:25.29]Shit what's that thing whoa?
[132:33.62]I'm just easy No need to freak out.
[132:40.89]It's just an enemy you've never seen before Fucking dummy that was so easy
[133:12.28]God damn, fuck you!
[133:22.44]I wanted to fucking turn and shoot that shit.
[133:24.62]I'm dead.
[133:25.94]Oh, I hate not knowing what an enemy does!
[133:36.82]I would have been able to be fine if I just knew what any of those two fucking, three fucking things even did.
[133:43.64]Of course they're gonna throw that shit at me.
[133:45.58]Oh well.
[133:46.66]I tried.
[133:50.73]Oh well.
[133:52.81]I gave it the good try.
[133:57.07]Feels bad.
[134:01.37]Okay, well, let's go get our body back.
[134:03.75]I'm not a god gamer.
[134:08.73]Gotta upgrade the nail.
[134:09.59]Yeah, I know.
[134:11.49]Nah, there's no reason to be angry.
[134:12.93]It's okay.
[134:13.98]It's okay.
[134:15.40]I'm rubbing myself on the back.
[134:16.34]It's okay.
[134:16.98]Don't worry.
[134:17.34]You're gonna be fine.
[134:17.96]2600?
[134:23.32]Okay.
[134:23.48]To be fair, you're supposed to do it later in the game.
[134:27.84]Yeah, that's true.
[134:31.91]Yeah, I'm... I don't understand.
[134:33.53]I haven't seen this enemy.
[134:39.52]Okay.
[134:40.53]Well, that's where that is.
[134:42.89]Let's go upgrade the nail.
[134:44.09]So that's there.
[134:45.15]Cool.
[134:47.33]How am I doing?
[134:47.81]I'm doing very well, thank you.
[134:49.13]How are you?
[134:51.35]Uh, crund.
[134:52.77]Crunchy.
[134:54.36]Crunchy.
[134:55.04]Sorry, I missed your donation from a little while ago.
[134:58.20]Don't forget about your projectile move.
[135:00.84]I know.
[135:02.44]But thank you for these six bucks.
[135:04.64]Otto is a dachshund?
[135:05.42]Yes, he is.
[135:12.20]Uh... Do I recommend a doxa?
[135:15.90]This person wants to know what's a good dog breed that can be okay on its own while I work full time.
[135:24.78]Most small dogs are pretty easy.
[135:31.63]Oh shit, I thought that was a... Okay, I thought that was a caterpillar.
[135:34.61]Speaking of caterpillars...
[135:39.20]Speaking of caterpillars, let me look at this.
[135:42.55]So here's the course of action here.
[135:43.97]We're going to go... We need to go all the way over there.
[135:48.03]Where am I right now?
[135:52.29]Alright.
[135:52.77]You want to hear a small complaint?
[135:54.86]Small complaint about the game?
[135:55.86]Like, where the hell am I?
[136:02.94]Where am I right now on this map?
[136:05.28]The kingdom's edge city of tears, right?
[136:07.00]Like, we're...
[136:11.30]Where am I?
[136:12.66]Oh!
[136:25.03]Oh, you want a small complaint about the game?
[136:26.95]I don't have the compass on.
[136:32.99]I was about to complain that it wasn't like putting me where my character was.
[136:38.61]Whoops.
[136:40.49]Oh, fuck.
[136:41.53]I don't know where I am.
[136:43.83]I need that compass.
[136:47.11]I actually really need that compass because I don't fucking know where I am.
[136:52.24]I have no idea.
[136:56.20]Okay, I'm right there.
[136:58.40]Now I'm in the City of Tears.
[137:02.24]So I'm bottom right.
[137:04.61]So I gotta go like down here.
[137:11.02]Right?
[137:14.88]I think?
[137:15.64]I don't know.
[137:16.77]I don't know where I am.
[137:23.13]Um... I don't... I swear to God, I don't know where I am.
[137:30.35]I went from the Coliseum of Stupid.
[137:31.55]I just dropped down here.
[137:32.95]So I gotta go right down right.
[137:40.49]I have no idea.
[137:41.61]Guys, I'm one of those people that if I don't have a G... If I don't have a GPS when I'm driving a car, I can't drive the car.
[137:52.54]I probably... I don't know.
[137:57.67]I think I'm going the right way.
[137:58.61]Get down!
[138:04.39]Why does it always do that shit?
[138:06.35]Come on, I'm trying to do something here.
[138:18.39]Get out of here, Washington.
[138:23.27]There we are.
[138:23.81]King's Station.
[138:24.61]Thank God.
[138:30.35]Boink.
[138:31.87]Let's do it.
[138:34.04]Let's go back to Dirtmouth.
[138:36.70]Because I need to see something.
[138:38.92]I want to go to the Caterpillar Land.
[138:52.78]The long nail's gonna spoil me, I know.
[138:55.46]I'm gonna do the compass, I know.
[138:56.92]I will, don't worry.
[139:00.73]Oh, but I lose that.
[139:01.97]Oh well, it's okay.
[139:04.11]That's not necessary at the moment.
[139:06.39]What can I do?
[139:10.31]Whoops, wrong way.
[139:17.88]You sell any more things?
[139:19.93]Okay.
[139:21.09]Resting grounds.
[139:21.93]We're just going to buy all this.
[139:24.71]I'm buying this.
[139:25.69]I don't even care what it is.
[139:28.83]And then... Whispering root pin.
[139:32.80]Yeah, get it all.
[139:33.34]This is going to show me where the orange peels are.
[139:36.36]Warrior's grave.
[139:39.30]Yeah, I don't even care.
[139:40.08]Buy it all.
[139:40.54]I'm loaded right now.
[139:43.25]And this shows all the trams.
[139:45.19]Yeah, good.
[139:46.93]I have like 1500 bucks in the bank.
[139:56.07]Anything else?
[140:01.63]Ooh, vessel fragment.
[140:04.79]And a simple key.
[140:08.56]Yeah, give me this.
[140:14.76]Why not?
[140:18.56]I can't really buy this right now.
[140:19.86]Do you have any more dialog?
[140:24.60]No, no, no.
[140:25.72]Too glorious.
[140:29.08]No, whatever.
[140:29.48]Fuck you.
[140:29.82]Alright.
[140:36.08]Train.
[140:39.70]It is, I need to go to Green Path?
[140:43.43]No, it's Queens, Queens Station, right?
[140:47.13]Top left of Queens Station.
[140:48.61]It's like right there, okay.
[140:56.96]Do you have any new dialog?
[141:03.95]Yeah, nah, fuck you.
[141:07.37]2000, two pale.
[141:07.77]I have the two pale and I have money in the bank, so I'm gonna go get it.
[141:19.26]Okay, now it is over here, right?
[141:28.21]Check the grubs.
[141:28.79]Yep, I'm gonna do that too.
[141:36.29]Hello!
[141:37.63]I'd like to make a withdrawal.
[141:40.67]Uh, yeah, I'd like all of it, please.
[141:44.58]All of it.
[141:45.68]Come on.
[141:46.86]And I want that in... I want that in one dollar bills.
[141:52.18]Alright.
[141:54.76]Let's go upgrade the nail.
[141:58.71]When is a no bench, no charm run?
[142:00.51]Never.
[142:02.15]I will never do that.
[142:03.41]I still haven't even done this place yet.
[142:08.98]Oddly enough.
[142:15.33]Little Nightmares is not out for another month.
[142:17.11]I'll check it out.
[142:19.11]I will check that out.
[142:19.99]I'll see if it's any good.
[142:21.95]Check the grubs.
[142:22.53]We're going to go dirt mouth.
[142:31.14]Watch me die and lose all my money.
[142:32.34]That would be horrible.
[142:35.34]Check out the grubs.
[142:38.02]Uh, do I recommend this game?
[142:39.56]I'm really considering buying it when there's a sale.
[142:41.60]I would say buy it now.
[142:43.90]This game's only 15 bucks.
[142:46.80]And it is... It's an exceptional game.
[142:52.80]Exceptional.
[142:55.52]This game already is a bargain.
[143:00.39]So, I would say support the developer and buy it full price.
[143:08.86]Considering that $15 is really not that much money for... The amount of shit that you get in this game, the amount of, um... Like, the experience you're getting... Is... Like... I mean, it's... It's just... It's just incredible.
[143:24.73]$15 for, like, 60 fucking hours of stuff?
[143:28.92]That's remarkable.
[143:31.96]Okay.
[143:36.20]Anything else?
[143:36.56]You got anything else for me?
[143:37.22]Come on.
[143:39.08]Item?
[143:39.54]Okay, good.
[143:39.96]Item.
[143:41.98]More stuff.
[143:42.56]I'm gonna wait till the whole explosion's over.
[143:44.38]Nice.
[143:49.23]Nice.
[143:51.01]Nice.
[143:51.67]Okay.
[143:51.97]That it?
[143:53.37]It's probably a fragment.
[143:56.39]No, it's a rancid egg.
[143:57.41]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[144:01.69]There's apparently 10...
[144:07.22]Or like 12 more that I haven't found.
[144:09.65]60 hours of game is more than normal AAA games, yeah.
[144:15.81]For sure.
[144:16.05]Let me just get out of the way.
[144:24.25]I have 5,000.
[144:25.07]Okay, let's be cautious here.
[144:29.24]Don't just be a cocky asshole.
[144:31.20]I'm gonna be in deep shit otherwise.
[144:33.52]I can go buy the key.
[144:35.56]Let's just blow all of our money.
[144:36.76]We just got it.
[144:37.30]Let's just get rid of it.
[144:45.29]Alright.
[144:46.51]Blacksmith.
[144:47.83]Blacksmith is down here.
[144:49.83]So that means I need to go to...
[144:52.46]Either city, storeroom, or King's Station.
[144:58.93]We'll just go King's.
[145:01.07]I wish there was another way.
[145:07.75]We'll just go to the city storeroom.
[145:16.64]Let's go down.
[145:22.66]Deposit all the money?
[145:25.02]Well, I need 2,000.
[145:26.04]Can I give you an update on my shaving cream, Jello?
[145:32.99]I use shaving cream from The Art of Shaving.
[145:36.11]I use the cream.
[145:37.43]It's called Oud.
[145:39.83]Oud.
[145:40.89]That's like the kind of fragrance it is.
[145:43.33]It's Oud.
[145:44.49]I believe it's O-U-D.
[145:46.94]That's my shaving cream.
[145:48.12]I use it.
[145:48.52]I use a brush.
[145:49.83]I shave with shaving cream and a brush.
[145:52.49]And then I use a safety razor.
[145:56.67]Yeah.
[145:57.77]Do I not have the compass on right now?
[145:59.27]Okay.
[145:59.61]I was going to say, what the fuck?
[146:01.28]So I'm just going to go down to the left.
[146:02.44]Got it.
[146:08.08]Ood?
[146:09.62]Ood, dude.
[146:10.20]Yeah, I use Ood, dude.
[146:16.89]Ah, I knew it was going to happen.
[146:27.81]I can make up for unequipping the Spore Medal by playing Spore.
[146:32.53]No.
[146:34.75]Here's what I'm going to say about this game for the time being.
[146:41.42]This is probably the last stream I'm going to do scheduled of this game.
[146:47.85]You'll end up seeing this game again maybe on an off day.
[146:50.97]If I haven't beat it yet, maybe we'll go back to it.
[146:53.99]But there's other stuff that's come out over the last couple of weeks that I really want to play.
[146:58.35]And especially on Tuesday, Dark Souls 3's DLC.
[147:01.07]Like, we have to play that.
[147:02.99]That's like a staple of this channel.
[147:04.97]Dark Souls 3, I beat that on stream.
[147:06.81]You know, I have to fucking play it.
[147:09.15]Day one.
[147:15.24]No, no, no, what am I doing?
[147:25.54]We'll see, though.
[147:26.18]I don't know.
[147:29.72]But it's so much better than the crap that I played before.
[147:32.42]I don't have, like... I've talked to you guys about this before.
[147:39.51]I don't have, like, a set game or a set thing or a set way that I'm gonna do streams.
[147:47.69]I just do whatever the fuck I want.
[147:51.14]I do things that I think I'm gonna have fun doing.
[147:54.93]There's no, well, I have to play this game.
[147:56.79]I have to do this.
[147:57.51]I have to do that.
[147:59.67]I just kind of do it.
[148:05.38]Well, let's get another upgrade.
[148:09.60]Like, some people play a game that they, like, they play it every day or they play it every other day.
[148:13.18]Like, I just do whatever.
[148:16.78]Please upgrade by now.
[148:17.46]2,000 Geo and 2 Pale Ore.
[148:18.10]Yes, please.
[148:28.31]Alright, give it a couple of whacks.
[148:36.26]Why do I charge my super dash so I can move 10 inches forward and immediately stop?
[148:39.20]Because I'm obsessive compulsive.
[148:45.08]Alright, cool.
[148:46.02]Let's see what it looks like.
[148:51.14]I've just been like pounding coffee.
[148:53.46]Oh, look, it's got spirals on it now.
[148:56.97]You know when you just pound coffee and it makes you have to pee, like, once an hour?
[149:02.04]I'm currently in that mode right now.
[149:03.94]I have to pee again.
[149:04.92]Alright.
[149:15.51]Here's the question, though.
[149:18.19]After I pee... I got that king's seal.
[149:26.62]Where do I use that?
[149:30.53]I have a king's seal.
[149:33.17]It's like that weird pitchfork looking thing.
[149:35.87]Wasn't there a door?
[149:38.86]Or an object that I couldn't use somewhere in this game?
[149:42.26]I remember seeing it.
[149:47.12]I don't remember.
[149:48.73]But I will do that when I get back from going to the bathroom.
[149:51.27]I'll be right back.
[151:59.69]Thank you.
[152:43.06]Thank you.
[153:47.69]Oh, that was a birdman.
[153:50.66]Remember that?
[153:51.16]From that, um... Whoops.
[153:55.54]Whoops.
[153:55.84]What if I just change scenes?
[153:57.68]Like, oh, yeah.
[153:58.78]Whoops.
[153:59.06]Hold on.
[153:59.80]Here's the joke.
[154:01.04]I gotta set this joke up.
[154:04.54]I'll be right back.
[154:05.36]I gotta set a joke up real quick.
[154:06.44]Hold on.
[154:41.93]What if I came back from break?
[154:44.39]I messed up.
[154:44.91]Let me move some stuff around.
[154:46.81]One second, guys.
[154:47.35]It's got a little bit of a... Oh, wait a minute!
[154:51.09]Oh, shit!
[154:52.93]Oh, my credit card!
[154:55.89]That wasn't very funny.
[154:58.53]I don't know.
[154:59.21]That was not funny.
[155:00.05]That could have been funny.
[155:02.95]But it wasn't that funny.
[155:04.37]I tried.
[155:07.55]Where am I going?
[155:12.28]I'm rich.
[155:18.16]Grab it, grab it, grab it, grab it.
[155:24.19]Okay.
[155:25.37]Where was I going?
[155:27.17]Down here, right?
[155:30.47]I think.
[155:30.73]It was either down there or top left.
[155:35.57]I believe I have to go down.
[155:38.11]So I'm going to go down.
[155:40.77]So from where I am right now, where Insidious here is, I just have to drop, go right and then go down left, okay.
[155:55.75]Sounds like a plan.
[156:08.58]Like, and why would it be labeled?
[156:09.68]Why would I write credit card on it?
[156:12.45]What would there be a reason for me to have my credit card labeled credit card?
[156:18.53]On the screen.
[156:19.61]For a Twitch stream.
[156:21.05]Why would that have to happen?
[156:23.71]What about down here?
[156:29.63]I thought I got a Royal Waterways map.
[156:32.15]Should I be down here?
[156:36.01]I don't know.
[156:36.51]Should I be down here?
[156:40.01]chest in here.
[156:42.77]Get out of here.
[156:47.78]Oh, there's a secret.
[156:52.60]Alright, watch the face.
[156:53.72]Watch the face.
[156:54.26]Excuse me.
[157:00.20]Wait, what happened?
[157:03.51]Uh, the Gaffster, thank you for the five dollars, says, Jerma, you're an inspiration for making YouTube videos.
[157:08.63]Thank you for being that way that you are.
[157:10.95]Here's money from the credit card you just posted.
[157:14.80]Well, I hope that's not true, because I tried to make that credit card, like, unimaginably weird.
[157:19.34]This is the shittiest area.
[157:26.41]Don't take something if it isn't yours.
[157:27.69]That's the law.
[157:28.37]Everything you see, it belongs to me.
[157:30.11]Don't be angry.
[157:30.67]I'll share my food with you if you give me Geo.
[157:34.49]Okay.
[157:37.95]This is Gio's mine now.
[157:40.13]Don't try to take it back.
[157:41.23]Here, take your food with you when you leave.
[157:45.58]What?
[157:47.44]It's just another egg.
[157:48.52]I don't want another rancid egg.
[157:52.20]You're gonna give me another egg, aren't you?
[158:04.57]Another rancid egg.
[158:06.13]I'm doing it again.
[158:07.17]Why does it keep getting cheaper?
[158:13.46]Yeah.
[158:20.40]Okay.
[158:21.54]Is it still getting cheaper again?
[158:23.64]No, now it's 92.
[158:27.32]I want this money because I need to use it for something, so fuck you.
[158:32.85]Whatever.
[158:43.91]I don't know.
[158:44.65]Probably not.
[158:45.35]It's like another area to explore.
[158:53.41]There's like a lot of chests in here though.
[159:09.22]I kind of don't want to do this right now.
[159:20.07]Oh, please.
[159:26.11]Well, it says there's a bench over here.
[159:29.99]Why is it painted on the wall?
[159:34.99]Is this some kind of lie?
[159:36.10]Am I being lied to?
[159:37.16]On Earth?
[159:47.39]Oh.
[159:49.03]Alright.
[159:52.23]Okay, I guess.
[159:55.59]I gotta find the map guy.
[159:59.09]I have too much money to be fucking around down here, though.
[160:03.29]Here, look.
[160:03.55]Another egg.
[160:06.39]Hmm.
[160:11.65]Hmm.
[160:18.21]Where's the guy?
[160:18.57]Where's the newspaper guy?
[160:24.17]Where's the guy with the newspapers?
[160:28.10]I just want to find the guy with the newspaper.
[160:29.78]Is he in here?
[160:36.24]Somebody's making noise.
[160:37.06]Is somebody up here?
[160:40.42]I don't know.
[160:43.39]Hello?
[160:43.51]Hello?
[160:45.95]Hello?
[160:54.33]The sweetest chef is in here.
[161:00.01]Who is making this?
[161:04.69]Where is this person?
[161:09.24]What is this?
[161:10.56]What is this?
[161:14.40]Oh no!
[161:15.92]It's a boss!
[161:17.14]Alright, everybody be quiet!
[161:18.24]He's throwing meatballs!
[161:23.45]What are you doing?
[161:24.43]How did I not get hit?
[161:25.15]Hold on.
[161:25.43]I'm like all tangled up.
[161:29.25]I just got... I gotta like move some shit around.
[161:31.25]Here we go.
[161:31.67]Okay, here we go.
[161:32.23]What about the meat?
[161:32.67]Should I hit the meatballs?
[161:34.72]Okay, I can bounce the meatballs.
[161:41.78]I can bounce him too.
[161:54.20]I can make him go faster.
[161:55.74]I'm not sure I want to be doing that.
[161:57.26]This guy's like kind of a joke.
[161:58.44]He's kind of like jokey.
[161:59.96]Is this guy jokey to you guys?
[162:03.25]He turns into like a basketball.
[162:05.17]I mean, he seems a little jokey to me.
[162:23.52]Whoa, okay, that's new.
[162:25.12]How many times are you gonna fucking do this shit, man?
[162:58.35]Watch out for the meatballs!
[163:00.09]Shit!
[163:11.14]Got it.
[163:13.12]Got it.
[163:15.97]Phase one.
[163:20.05]Nice, alright.
[163:21.35]I beat the king of the meatballs.
[163:24.57]And I got Defender's Crest.
[163:30.81]What is that?
[163:33.57]What is the defender's crest?
[163:39.54]What?
[163:57.49]You just... emit a heroic smell?
[164:00.07]What the hell does that mean?
[164:06.15]Well, I... don't know what I just did.
[164:11.67]Okay, I either drained the water or I added water.
[164:16.48]I don't really know.
[164:17.40]It's like a giant Mountain Dew bottle.
[164:22.68]Yes, thank you.
[164:23.64]Now the Mountain Dew will flow through the city of Hollow Nest.
[164:27.85]My two liter bottle.
[164:29.59]Nice and fizzy and shaken up.
[164:31.53]Just the way I like it.
[164:32.33]Yeah.
[164:39.44]Still don't have a map of the area.
[164:49.02]I do remember this, though.
[164:53.05]Well, I guess I just beat the boss.
[164:55.05]But now what?
[165:08.21]I wish I could get a fucking area map.
[165:09.91]I'm gonna go backwards from here.
[165:15.36]Can I go backwards from here?
[165:17.34]Because I want... I feel like the map guy is not back that way.
[165:20.24]I feel like he's here.
[165:23.68]Secret?
[165:24.62]No.
[165:39.83]Did that do anything for here?
[165:43.86]I don't know.
[165:48.26]I'm sure I'm trying to find that out.
[165:52.22]Delicious meatballs.
[165:53.34]Thank you, Gummy Monk.
[165:54.58]For the five bucks.
[165:56.87]They were delicious meatballs.
[166:00.55]Gotta follow them out in dewpipes.
[166:06.05]Well, I can break this.
[166:07.85]Just make sure there's nothing over here.
[166:11.10]These are Spongebob characters.
[166:23.71]During the water?
[166:27.59]Did I do that?
[166:28.29]Did I do this?
[166:28.85]I hate getting lost down in these areas just because there's no way for me to tell where the hell I'm going.
[166:38.01]I don't know.
[166:49.83]equip the heroic odor.
[166:54.14]I will.
[166:58.98]I think I'm just going in circles right now.
[167:00.66]Hold on.
[167:11.04]Well, I can do that.
[167:29.20]Yeah, from here, let's go.
[167:30.48]Oh!
[167:30.54]I don't even have a map for this area.
[167:41.61]What the fuck?
[167:46.69]I don't even know where the fuck I am.
[167:51.07]I'm like somewhere over here.
[167:57.32]Ugh.
[168:02.14]map bullshit.
[168:07.38]Well, there's the Mountain Dew.
[168:10.06]Mountain Dew's going this way.
[168:15.02]Hey!
[168:15.94]Found the Mountain Dew!
[168:16.60]Alright, time to follow the Mountain Dew.
[168:22.23]Right?
[168:22.41]It goes this way.
[168:31.61]Ugh.
[168:35.45]Am I mad?
[168:36.01]Yeah.
[168:41.62]I really just don't like this part of the game.
[168:51.14]There were others.
[168:53.34]Oh, it's you.
[168:55.12]I'm glad to see you.
[168:56.21]No, please, don't say a word.
[168:57.29]I must apologize for my previous behavior.
[168:58.85]Entirely my fault.
[168:59.61]I mistook you for one of those mindless, skulking husks.
[169:03.94]Yeah, you best be.
[169:05.70]Yeah, yeah.
[169:13.06]This guy's voice is fucking weird.
[169:14.78]I went in a big circle.
[169:15.56]Yeah, I wouldn't have gone in a big circle if I could even have any idea where I was.
[169:22.42]You know, when you hold down left bumper and it says... No.
[169:26.06]No smoking.
[169:27.97]See, look.
[169:28.41]No smoking in here.
[169:31.94]I would love to know where I was in the game.
[169:33.51]I would love to see, like, is it a very... It's an extremely complicated, interconnected world with dozens of areas and hundreds of places to go.
[169:42.49]No smoking in here.
[169:43.53]Mm-hmm.
[169:46.30]You're gonna give me something?
[169:53.92]Okay, thanks.
[169:54.62]Bye.
[170:04.28]I guess we're just going to wrap around and see where I can go.
[170:06.98]I can't go up, right?
[170:21.21]Okay.
[170:26.09]Oh, I went the opposite way of the map guy?
[170:27.53]Well, how am I supposed to know where the map guy is?
[170:31.02]There's no indication.
[170:31.88]He's just, like, he's just in one part of the area.
[170:35.73]Map guy is just in a spot somewhere on each zone.
[170:40.09]And you have to find the paper trail.
[170:41.45]And if you don't find the first paper, you're not gonna find him.
[170:51.02]Get away from me, you flower.
[171:03.92]Here's the bench.
[171:05.57]I love how the map's been updated.
[171:12.15]Can't do anything else.
[171:12.83]Can I go from here?
[171:15.69]Flower.
[171:16.63]Alright, this way?
[171:29.57]Oh, fuck.
[171:31.13]Oh, I'm alive.
[171:36.16]Secret floor?
[171:38.38]I'll deal with the secret floor later.
[171:39.60]Right now, I need to just find Map Guy.
[171:56.99]Is Map Guy... There's a secret... I... I... Don't... Don't worry.
[171:59.79]Wait... Secret!
[172:01.69]Oh, secret, huh?
[172:03.21]Jerma, you missed a secret.
[172:04.43]Jerma, you missed a secret.
[172:06.85]Oh, what you meant to say was, I went and got this.
[172:08.76]Because this is a secret.
[172:11.96]Secret!
[172:14.52]You mean that?
[172:15.00]You mean the thing I would not have found?
[172:16.98]Stupid.
[172:19.28]Secret.
[172:21.48]And this, too.
[172:22.28]Map guy's over here.
[172:24.40]Finally.
[172:24.76]He's got a lot of money.
[172:35.49]Secret emote?
[172:39.51]It's gonna be me with my finger on my mouth going like, shhh!
[172:43.19]This place is pretty big.
[173:16.91]Is everything open now?
[173:22.79]What was the point of that?
[173:34.58]Don't know what that opened, but it opened something.
[173:37.82]Hello Geodude.
[173:42.30]Yes, I'd like to buy one of your maps.
[173:44.35]Thank you.
[173:47.75]Now I can finally see where the hell I am.
[173:50.75]Fungal Wastes is that way.
[173:53.75]That just connects to there.
[173:54.91]There's really only like two places I haven't gone.
[174:01.19]Oh, the top just connects back to the City of Tears.
[174:05.81]Oh, I can go down.
[174:09.15]I guess.
[174:14.70]Apparently.
[174:19.09]Well.
[174:21.21]Go back to the hole.
[174:21.87]I'm going.
[174:22.75]I'm going.
[174:25.89]Hey, Brovalone.
[174:26.57]Thanks for the $5.
[174:28.57]Can't wait to see what the next big video is.
[174:30.09]Oh, I can't wait for you to see it either.
[174:33.38]Trust me on that one.
[174:34.22]See Spongebob character.
[174:40.06]That's like... Yeah.
[174:42.22]That's like Plankton's shitty older cousin.
[174:45.65]It's Rankton.
[174:48.09]Oh shit, my god, it's Rankton!
[174:50.89]SpongeBob, it's me, Rankton.
[174:55.39]I will get that Krabby Patty recipe if it kills me.
[174:58.41]It's me, Rankton.
[175:06.66]SpongeBob?
[175:15.51]This way.
[175:20.14]Yeah.
[175:23.52]Oh, I thought that was longer than it was.
[175:29.30]Get up there.
[175:36.09]Rewind to flank them.
[175:39.65]I'm gonna try to go down.
[175:41.59]Where was that secret floor?
[175:42.45]Everyone was screaming at me.
[175:46.16]I was getting screamed at.
[175:47.46]Where was it?
[175:49.26]It was like right over here, right?
[175:50.16]Where's that secret scream floor?
[175:56.42]Where's that floor?
[175:57.68]What was that floor that people were screaming at me for?
[176:01.22]Did I miss it?
[176:09.22]No, I didn't miss it.
[176:17.59]Secret!
[176:20.77]Yep.
[176:21.47]Didn't see that one, did you?
[176:25.27]Didn't see that secret flow now, did you?
[176:37.99]Down here.
[176:42.33]And we're at the bench now.
[176:43.87]Where's the secret floor?
[176:46.62]By the bench?
[176:47.12]You guys are talking about by the bench.
[176:52.52]I don't see a secret.
[176:56.92]It was by the bench.
[176:57.63]It was by the bench.
[176:58.29]It was by the bench.
[176:58.97]It was by the bench.
[177:10.29]Oh sick it Watch out for the bug that goes
[177:36.54]What else is even down here?
[177:37.52]I already beat the boss.
[177:38.38]What's the rest of the... What's the other reason for being down here?
[177:43.06]Unless there's another boss.
[177:44.32]Or another thing.
[177:45.00]Shit, I thought he was dead.
[177:52.84]Oh well.
[178:09.74]Fuck.
[178:10.86]I'm not expecting you guys to just be in the exact same place that I... The exact spot that I want to land.
[178:20.57]Whatever.
[178:22.85]I'm not even angry at that.
[178:23.83]I don't even care.
[178:28.34]Watch out for the tendrils.
[178:29.24]Watch out for the weird worms.
[178:32.22]It's just like the Earthworm Jim 2 level.
[178:37.03]That plays Beethoven.
[178:39.15]While you go through as a worm.
[178:40.27]At least he's even hurt.
[178:47.23]Am I doing this for no reason?
[178:48.47]Probably.
[178:52.36]Oh boy.
[178:52.92]Hold on a minute.
[178:56.86]We got a big donation here.
[179:00.00]I'm getting hit.
[179:00.66]I'm getting hit.
[179:01.12]I'm getting hit.
[179:01.50]I'm getting hit.
[179:01.90]I'm all tabbed.
[179:02.54]I'm all tabbed.
[179:05.32]I'm getting... Hold on.
[179:09.17]Orthocone.
[179:11.15]Orthocone just gave a hundred bucks.
[179:15.37]Says, Hey Jerma, I haven't been able to make it to many streams lately, so here's some money to make up for it.
[179:20.51]I hope you're happy with yourself.
[179:23.61]You don't gotta pay me money just because you haven't been watching the streams, dude.
[179:26.15]I mean, thank you nonetheless, but you don't like... Secret!
[179:35.56]Don't feel like you owe me money because you haven't watched my streams.
[179:41.70]You should never feel that way, dude.
[179:44.22]Although I'm glad to see you back.
[179:46.36]Glad to see you return.
[179:50.32]Oh, hold on.
[179:52.51]Not yet, not yet.
[179:59.07]Not yet.
[180:01.55]I got a lot of money.
[180:04.56]Bench is right there.
[180:05.52]Let me just... Hold on.
[180:11.92]Not yet.
[180:12.92]I need to just make sure there's nothing else I have to, like, open, or... I don't know.
[180:19.38]There's a giant, like, worm boss over there.
[180:21.14]Yeah, so this is what I wanted, because this will wrap me down around.
[180:26.89]There's, like, a little secret entrance, because that brings me right to here.
[180:29.85]Yeah, okay, that's a good... I'm really glad I did that, because now I'm gonna die, like, three times, but it's okay, because the bench is here.
[180:41.30]The bench is right here.
[180:44.94]Map is updated.
[180:45.66]I got my entrance.
[180:47.00]Let's go fight the weird boss that's down here.
[180:53.38]Let's fight the worm boss and see where we're at.
[180:59.90]Whoops.
[181:00.40]I accidentally went the wrong way.
[181:06.71]Wait, did I?
[181:08.99]Like, can you please?
[181:10.51]I did.
[181:10.99]Okay.
[181:15.29]Let's go fight the worm and see what happens.
[181:18.09]I got a lot of money.
[181:19.13]If I die, I really want to get it back.
[181:23.90]Uh, time to potentially fight boss.
[181:26.18]Here we are.
[181:31.36]Um...
[181:33.99]Hold on a minute.
[181:34.59]Hold on.
[181:36.26]Unzip my pants with this one.
[181:39.32]Can't we all?
[181:40.56]These things gotta be off.
[181:41.66]Alright.
[181:44.04]Okay.
[181:52.27]Um.
[181:54.49]I guess I have to, like, activate him?
[181:56.41]Yep.
[181:57.51]Fluke Marm!
[182:02.89]Alright, he spits out enemies.
[182:12.00]That might be all he does, I'm not sure.
[182:13.54]Alright, you can tell where they're gonna come from because of their... the goo that comes out.
[182:22.24]Got it.
[182:30.53]Oh, fuck.
[182:31.29]Should've saw that coming.
[182:34.74]Doesn't seem that difficult though.
[182:36.19]I thought this might be the first phase.
[182:47.03]He just explodes.
[182:50.79]What did he drop?
[182:52.07]Fluke nest.
[183:01.43]That was the easiest boss in the game.
[183:07.32]Yeah.
[183:09.10]That was the easiest boss in the whole game.
[183:11.06]Okay.
[183:12.78]Let's take a look at what that is.
[183:14.08]Oh, I can get a new Charm Notch.
[183:16.20]I can go buy a new Charm Notch.
[183:18.30]Uh, Fluke Nest.
[183:22.90]Transforms the Vengeful Spirit spell into a horde of volatile baby flukes.
[183:30.73]That's interesting, I guess.
[183:37.98]Oh yeah, that's right.
[183:38.80]I do have the upgraded nail.
[183:40.06]That's true.
[183:42.40]Still.
[183:46.08]Alright.
[183:47.12]Another boss down.
[183:48.02]How many bosses have I killed?
[183:49.13]Has anybody been keeping any track?
[183:51.83]How many bosses is that?
[183:53.21]10?
[183:53.23]12?
[183:53.81]I don't even know.
[183:57.81]What's even counted as a boss in this game?
[183:59.35]I'm not sure how far I am in the boss department.
[184:09.99]Let's take a look.
[184:10.43]Will you get out of the way?
[184:13.49]At least four?
[184:14.31]It's been more than that.
[184:15.99]It's been probably 12 or so.
[184:19.21]Uh... That's probably... I beat both the bosses that were in here.
[184:23.65]I guess we're gonna go down?
[184:26.49]Mmm... Mmm...
[184:39.52]Yeah, I'll probably play for another 20 minutes or so.
[184:42.42]Go for a good three and a half hours.
[184:44.20]Maybe four, depending.
[184:45.12]I'm just not sure.
[184:47.42]I need to fucking go down, I think.
[184:51.20]Ancient Basin, just all the way down to the bottom?
[184:57.18]It looks like I've been everywhere I can be in the waterway.
[185:06.21]Let's go up.
[185:06.73]I just want to save it and...
[185:25.49]I'm gonna sit on the bench.
[185:29.77]These guys are relentless.
[185:34.48]These stupid enemies are relentless.
[185:35.72]Alright.
[185:38.86]So... I'm gonna go down, I guess?
[185:52.35]All the way down there?
[185:56.83]I guess I can go that way.
[185:59.64]I guess.
[186:06.62]Fluke noises are cool.
[186:07.54]Yeah, they are.
[186:10.12]I don't know.
[186:28.48]I'm trying to figure out if I need to.
[186:32.12]No, I don't care.
[186:32.64]I don't want to fight these things.
[186:33.56]Please stop making those slurping noises.
[186:38.99]What?
[186:47.57]So, do I have to go down here?
[186:48.71]Oh.
[186:50.43]I already did this.
[186:55.33]Didn't I already do this?
[186:57.51]I already did the go through here.
[187:08.79]I thought I already did that.
[187:16.36]Oh, God.
[187:18.22]Oh, my God, where am I going?
[187:22.18]Where am I?
[187:22.60]Oh, shit.
[187:29.55]That kills me, but that water is the same exact water that I was just in!
[187:36.82]How come this Mountain Dew hurts, but the other Mountain Dew doesn't?
[187:41.20]It doesn't seem fair.
[187:49.11]Hey, Gobo!
[187:50.95]Thank you, Gobo.
[187:52.21]For the... Or Gobo, for the fifteen hundred.

[187:58.86]Keep up the good work.
[187:59.50]Well, thank you, Bilbo.
[188:01.76]Appreciate that.
[188:05.47]Somebody's boiling their Mountain Dew.
[188:13.04]Mountain spew.
[188:14.08]Oh, hey, look.
[188:17.92]Another rancid egg that I don't want.
[188:21.47]Please tell me that there's an NPC at some point in this game that is like, I want rancid eggs, bring me rancid eggs and I'll give you Geo.
[188:28.25]Because I really want to get rid of these.
[188:33.92]One's normal Mountain Dew, the other one's Mountain Dew Voltage.
[188:36.72]Yeah, this is Code Red.
[188:40.71]I'm drinking like Mountain Dew fucking Code Red.
[188:53.09]Uh, what was that?
[188:54.45]I'm not following the Mountain Dew here.
[189:02.17]What zone am I currently in, by the way?
[189:06.05]I don't know what zone I'm in.
[189:14.52]There is a use for those eggs.
[189:16.52]I'm sure there is.
[189:21.40]Oh, get out of here.
[189:24.10]Nothing in here?
[189:28.14]No, like, breakable ground?
[189:29.22]No breakable walls?
[189:31.09]Come on, no way.
[189:33.87]Alright, whatever.
[189:34.55]Apparently not.
[189:45.81]Mountain Dew Zone.
[189:48.41]Uh, enter.
[189:48.93]Enter what?
[189:56.06]Um... What is this?
[190:07.61]So I just came in like the back door of somebody's house and they're having sex.
[190:13.88]Somebody's getting like laid in here.
[190:15.14]Am I like intruding on this?
[190:17.86]It's like, look, there's like roses, candles and shit.
[190:20.08]I'm like walking in on a very intimate evening.
[190:26.43]Nope.
[190:27.42]Nope, just a person, like, kicking their feet around, having fun.
[190:31.62]Hi.
[190:32.58]Oh, it's not often I see visitors.
[190:36.86]It's been so long.
[190:37.66]Ages, even.
[190:38.10]I just hope my manners haven't left me.
[190:39.60]You've no doubt sensed my affluence.
[190:41.81]You're right to guess.
[190:42.39]I'm renowned amongst the upper caste of Hallownest.
[190:45.93]Well, I was once, until those Cretans cast me out.
[190:48.33]Have you met them?
[190:48.85]My former fellows?
[190:49.55]Oh, they're all assholes.
[190:53.59]Hate can be a wonderful thing.
[190:56.56]Could it be?
[190:58.42]You've returned at last.
[190:59.16]No, no.
[190:59.68]Oh, pardon me for just a moment.
[191:00.96]I mistook a certain quality about you.
[191:02.66]You seemed almost regal.
[191:04.72]Silly, I know it's clear you're not of high birth wandering about all dirty and tattered like that.
[191:10.27]Isn't life just wonderful?
[191:12.13]Isn't life just wonderful?
[191:13.55]Yeah.
[191:14.87]No doubt this one will meet its demise at the nails of the city's guards.
[191:18.13]I'll outlive you too, little grub, as I did all the others.
[191:23.55]Well.
[191:25.84]I'm going to leave your house.
[191:30.54]Where is she?
[191:34.82]What the hell is this?
[191:37.02]Now we're up here.
[191:47.92]I want to go back in her back door.
[191:49.32]There we go.
[191:51.68]Yeah.
[191:52.08]Sorry, lady.
[191:52.58]I need to go in your back door and escape there.
[192:07.52]So there was something else there.
[192:08.72]There's other things to look at.
[192:14.92]Alright.
[192:15.42]Oh, yeah.
[192:16.16]Okay.
[192:16.96]I'm gonna go in her back door.
[192:18.79]You guys... Yep.
[192:19.53]You got me.
[192:24.51]Oh, I can be smelly.
[192:25.29]That's right.
[192:26.17]I need a bench, though.
[192:28.91]There's still something else over here that I didn't see.
[192:36.36]Um... This keeps going.
[192:40.78]Fucking hell, man.
[192:41.52]This keeps... This does just keep going, huh?
[192:45.02]What else is there?
[192:48.44]So much.
[192:49.80]Okay, that's a death.
[192:50.51]Alright.
[192:51.01]Alright.
[192:54.12]Can I... No, I... I promised that was not me being an idiot.
[193:04.86]That was.
[193:05.28]Alright.
[193:08.43]Heal up.
[193:22.54]Another gauntlet.
[193:24.60]Something on the other side of this door.
[193:26.02]Hopefully it's worth the... slight pain in the ass that this is giving.
[193:32.14]Okay.
[193:32.76]What is it?
[193:33.92]Hold on.
[193:36.63]Nothing else.
[193:48.13]Still have a lot of money.
[193:53.71]Wait, I hear a... No?
[193:59.28]Can't go in any of these random places?
[194:02.40]None of these break?
[194:05.92]Um... Oh!
[194:10.29]Isma's Grove.
[194:14.33]Um... Hello?
[194:15.67]What was that?
[194:19.53]Isma's Tear.
[194:21.72]Acid shall be repelled to swim in acidic waters without causing harm.
[194:25.24]God, there's so many things.
[194:28.41]There's so many places where that can be used.
[194:32.95]There's so many places where that can be used.
[194:38.15]Yikes.
[194:38.85]There's so much in this game.
[194:48.77]Yeah, Mountain Dew Code Red is now drinkable.
[194:55.53]I had to get blessed by a priest to be able to drink Code Red Mountain Dew.
[195:01.96]Alright.
[195:03.60]Time to backtrack.
[195:04.96]Now, backtrack, boys.
[195:07.26]Hey, we backtracking, boys.
[195:09.84]Question is, where?
[195:10.56]Where?
[195:13.63]Where?
[195:17.34]There was, like, at least three or four places where I could use that.
[195:19.52]One of them was over here, wasn't it?
[195:21.96]Wasn't it?
[195:22.58]Alright, easy, bug boy.
[195:31.61]Lime... Live wire?
[195:35.03]Alright, let's go.
[195:35.97]Can I do anything about this?
[195:38.91]All I see is the acid and I want to just drink it.
[195:40.73]I want to go in it.
[195:41.29]Ow!
[195:45.86]Ow!
[195:50.60]Alright, now that we have that.
[195:59.23]Over here, right?
[196:01.69]Ay, ay, ay.
[196:04.33]Let's go up.
[196:20.60]Go up here.
[196:25.26]Now I need to find spike immunity.
[196:27.90]Seriously, I know.
[196:28.56]Get out of the way!
[196:33.60]Get out of the way!
[196:35.92]God!
[196:37.52]Get out of my way!
[196:38.46]I don't want to fight you guys.
[196:42.02]I just want to... Oh, God!
[196:44.44]I need to check Nintendo power.
[196:48.52]I really do.
[196:48.98]There's a lot of places for me to go.
[196:57.39]We need to just go over to the right, go to the stag station.
[197:01.65]I need a bench.
[197:02.42]Do you guys want me to put on the heroic odor and go talk to that person?
[197:08.84]Let's do that.
[197:13.99]Found the acid, now all you need is the base.
[197:16.81]This is true.
[197:18.57]This is very true.
[197:24.55]Let's put on that charm.
[197:25.91]Let's see if that lady still hates me.
[197:30.71]Let's take off that quick focus for now and put on... I want to try this just for fun.
[197:40.09]Where is it?
[197:46.57]Where the fuck is this thing?
[197:57.74]Have I lost my mind?
[197:59.18]Have I gone over it like five times?
[198:07.67]Wait a minute.
[198:08.11]Have I lost my goddamn mind?
[198:21.76]There it is.
[198:25.96]I must have just... You know what?
[198:27.04]I thought that was... I thought that was... I thought I had it on.
[198:30.55]I've lost my fucking goddamn mind.
[198:33.53]Ugh.
[198:34.51]That's all this does?
[198:35.31]It just causes an annoying particle effect on you, Spring.
[198:43.47]Now he's gonna go back to... Wait a minute.
[198:47.18]Fuck.
[198:50.78]Where was that lady?
[198:53.89]Down into the... Where am I?
[199:06.98]She was down here, right?
[199:11.40]I'm just... I get so confused with this shit, man.
[199:13.68]It's just... This place... This game is so fucking massive.
[199:17.24]I get so lost.
[199:20.74]I'm so lost already, and I know where I need to go, but I don't.
[199:30.83]Alright, talk to me.
[199:36.21]Okay.
[199:37.13]If I didn't welcome you, I'd never have anyone to share my happiness with.
[199:41.34]Isn't life just wonderful?
[199:42.90]Isn't life just wonderful?
[199:49.98]It didn't do anything.
[199:56.16]I just, like, smell in front of this lady?
[199:58.32]That's it?
[199:59.38]Oh, well.
[200:02.45]Oh, well!
[200:03.77]It was worth a shot.
[200:10.39]Let's go get rid of this thing, because it's annoying.
[200:16.86]Being smelly is its own reward.
[200:21.05]true holy I thought it said that you get two I like I shouldn't even acknowledge your stench I know let's get this thing off
[200:43.12]The weird, oddly specific thing I need it for at some point in history.
[200:47.29]I'll stick with this.
[200:47.87]I like this setup.
[200:49.61]Seems like a pretty standard setup.
[200:53.09]And we're going to go... Queen's Stage.
[200:59.91]Back to the bank.
[201:02.82]Oh no, not yet.
[201:04.06]Yeah, no.
[201:06.28]I can buy another Notch.
[201:11.45]No, let's just deposit.
[201:12.41]No, let's not deposit.
[201:13.63]Let's deposit.
[201:14.53]Deposit.
[201:15.13]I'm going to deposit three grand.
[201:20.30]Or like 2,800 or 2,500.
[201:24.88]I don't really want to carry around all this money.
[201:30.49]And then I might... Let's see where we're at.
[201:41.73]Put in like... We'll put three grand in.
[201:48.34]I'd like to make a deposit.
[201:49.32]I'd like to deposit three thousand dollars, please.
[201:55.96]There.
[201:58.10]Three thousand.
[202:00.84]Exit.
[202:02.30]Goodbye then.
[202:03.36]Stay safe.
[202:06.15]What do I smell like?
[202:13.03]I have just been shitting here.
[202:15.97]Every time I've said I'm going to the bathroom, I just pretend to.
[202:20.09]And honestly, what I'm doing is I'm like muting my microphone and just going to the bathroom in this chair and pretending I'm going somewhere.
[202:31.07]It's actually, it's pretty heinous down here right now.
[202:36.36]So, Ancient Basin.
[202:38.22]We're gonna go down.
[202:38.86]We need to go to... King's Station, I guess.
[202:52.47]How have I not found anything down here?
[202:56.20]Yeah, we gotta go King's Station.
[202:59.06]It's like the closest fucking thing.
[203:00.32]That sucks.
[203:03.93]That really sucks.
[203:05.99]Whatever.
[203:08.05]Do I need a diaper change?
[203:16.15]Yeah.
[203:23.40]Ancient basin.
[203:26.82]We can go there from here.
[203:28.02]We go down.
[203:29.06]We can sneak down there, right?
[203:34.54]Wait.
[203:38.30]No, that's not the way I want to go.
[203:39.32]I want to go this way.
[203:46.59]Can you buy me a diaper?
[203:50.75]No, I'm alright.
[203:51.59]You don't need to buy me a diaper.
[203:54.96]What's a diaper for?
[204:01.68]Diaper?
[204:06.65]And then we go down and to the left.
[204:17.51]Get down to the basin.
[204:18.37]There we are.
[204:26.20]Ancient basin is this way.
[204:27.46]Let's just walk in the front door.
[204:40.07]Right in the front door.
[204:41.23]Okay.
[204:43.51]Okay.
[204:45.43]Okay.
[204:47.01]Hello.
[204:50.47]Now.
[204:52.33]Down?
[204:53.75]All the way down to the left?
[204:54.79]Like down where that little tunnel is?
[205:00.27]I think so, right?
[205:03.85]If I remember, it was down there.
[205:05.05]Does anyone remember?
[205:07.49]Who remembers?
[205:07.89]Who remembers?
[205:19.80]If memory serves me right.
[205:28.70]Out here.
[205:31.22]Which brings us to this spot where it's like, you can't go anywhere because you need a seal.
[205:36.81]Well, I'm going in now.
[205:54.67]Here we go.
[205:58.77]Just go behind there and it's just nothing.
[206:00.45]Just a brick wall.
[206:03.16]I feel like I can still hide.
[206:04.18]It's not a new area.
[206:06.34]Am I kind of scared though?
[206:14.14]Should I just dash over there?
[206:15.63]The woman's doing it.
[206:16.31]Fuck it.
[206:19.57]Oh, fuck.
[206:20.63]Oh, fuck.
[206:21.19]Okay.
[206:22.21]Are we going down?
[206:22.73]Are we going down or up?
[206:24.91]We going down or up?
[206:26.29]We're going down.
[206:27.39]I guess we're going down.
[206:28.35]There's one of those lily pads over there.
[206:32.95]Okay, a lily pad.
[206:35.89]A deep blue stone on top of dice.
[206:40.83]Can't do anything with this yet.
[206:42.08]Can I?
[206:49.22]So glad there's no fall damage.
[206:50.38]I would have died a thousand times if there was.
[206:58.75]Damn it.
[207:00.05]Damn it!
[207:05.21]Damn it.
[207:06.38]Oh well.
[207:06.54]Are you serious?
[207:18.00]Are you serious, dude?
[207:28.05]How much further down do I have to go?
[207:32.13]Who built this?
[207:37.04]How did you make this?
[207:40.82]Well, I guess this is the end.
[207:44.22]The abyss.
[207:44.84]I can go left or right.
[207:49.30]Well, I guess we're going to go right.
[207:53.34]At least it's named correctly.
[207:54.96]And there's something in there.
[207:57.73]Something in this goo.
[208:00.83]Well, I can make an assessment here.
[208:02.73]You know the black goo that shoots out from those tubes?
[208:05.71]I bet you I get the thing to make it so I can go through them.
[208:09.41]Ow.
[208:18.20]There's no map for this area.
[208:21.64]What is that?
[208:25.01]Why am I fighting dead versions of me?
[208:26.53]Or are these just regular enemies now?
[208:31.50]Okay.
[208:36.28]Now we're going up.
[208:39.52]Okay, I've got the whole school of fish chasing me right now.
[208:43.91]The entire fucking school of fish.
[208:48.45]These guys don't give me any soul.
[208:50.43]That's bullshit.
[208:55.54]Not even worth fighting in then.
[209:04.05]Huh?
[209:10.09]I turned on the lantern.
[209:16.15]Should I break it?
[209:18.43]I'm going to break it.
[209:19.43]I'm going to break it.
[209:28.67]I don't know what that did.
[209:33.09]I guess that's just a light?
[209:37.44]Hmm... I don't know what this is gonna do, but I'm doing it.
[209:45.66]Mistake.
[209:47.20]Mistake.
[209:48.68]Mistake.
[209:49.09]Not a mistake.
[209:54.93]Um... I need a new bench.
[210:02.81]I guess we're doing this.
[210:07.23]I guess.
[210:07.99]I guess.
[210:13.85]Oh, where am I going?
[210:16.09]Where am I going?
[210:19.27]I don't know.
[210:20.49]This place is creepy.
[210:22.17]I'm so far down here.
[210:25.71]Oh, no.
[210:26.29]There's something over there.
[210:28.93]Shit.
[210:29.59]Yeah, I gotta go around.
[210:31.33]I'm not leaving that item behind.
[210:32.33]Wait.
[210:33.23]I'm getting that thing.
[210:40.77]Maybe not.
[210:41.25]Do I have to drop down?
[210:46.42]Is there a place to destroy the ground over here?
[210:47.90]I don't think so.
[211:04.90]I don't think I can do anything about that right now.
[211:11.06]Oh, what?
[211:14.48]I knew it.
[211:15.48]I told you.
[211:17.14]Now I'm immune to the black goo.
[211:18.56]Now here it is.
[211:21.08]Shade cloak.
[211:21.72]Oh, God.
[211:22.50]Even more.
[211:28.00]Press right trigger to dash forwards.
[211:30.11]Now I have a sh... I just got invulnerability frames.
[211:35.75]Is that what just happened to me?
[211:38.01]Oh my god, I got invulnerability frames.
[211:41.23]Yes.
[211:42.65]I've been waiting all year for this.
[211:48.65]I've been waiting months for this.
[211:50.19]Arcane Egg.
[211:55.66]I think this is just a very expensive item.
[212:01.22]I actually get a Dark Souls roll now.
[212:06.04]Oh boy.
[212:08.46]Okay.
[212:14.02]Let's go back.
[212:14.66]I don't know where I'm going.
[212:21.17]Was there a spot for me to go?
[212:22.59]I don't even know.
[212:26.27]I don't know.
[212:26.93]There's so many.
[212:28.73]I remember like at least four or five of those goo things.
[212:36.43]Why am I freaking out?
[212:42.33]Alright, I'm going to get to a stopping point here.
[212:44.65]I'm getting a little overwhelmed with the game right now.
[212:53.83]I missed a charm back there.
[212:55.11]Oh well.
[212:56.91]I still haven't gotten left.
[212:57.65]We're going to go see what's left.
[213:00.07]And then I'm going to call it.
[213:02.53]Because I'm getting a little overwhelmed.
[213:04.29]A little.
[213:07.13]But I'm having lots of fun.
[213:15.81]No?
[213:16.21]No complaints?
[213:16.81]No, not really.
[213:17.43]Well, there was one small complaint, but that was my own fault.
[213:19.53]And why am I going down a Mega Man hallway?
[213:22.95]I don't like this.
[213:25.63]This is the shit they do right in Mega Man, right before you get to the fucking boss.
[213:28.77]You get in that little Mega Man hallway.
[213:30.14]Huh?
[213:42.90]Um... Okay.
[213:56.91]Alright.
[213:59.87]Can't do anything with that.
[214:06.51]Screech?
[214:07.53]What do you mean, screech?
[214:09.15]I don't have a screech.
[214:13.67]I don't have a scream.
[214:17.38]And that really was a Mega Man boss room.
[214:20.44]Forward smash.
[214:23.78]I don't have this ability you guys speak of.
[214:26.44]I don't know.
[214:27.02]How did I not get hurt right there?
[214:30.45]I do not have the screech.
[214:32.99]I can't wait to get that and forget.
[214:34.25]I can't wait to get the screech and forget that this room even existed.
[214:47.26]Alright, let's get back to a stopping point.
[214:50.82]I'm going to call it here.
[214:59.97]I've got my money stored in the bank.
[215:03.33]Next time I play this, I'm just going to have to figure out where one of those things were.
[215:09.25]If you're a completionist, I can't imagine how much you would love this game.
[215:15.34]You're one of those crazy, super, super completionists.
[215:18.18]There's a lot of things.
[215:20.74]Guys, there's still places that I haven't gone to that I've been able to do with like the regular dash.
[215:26.77]Or like the double jump.
[215:31.33]Think about that.
[215:33.05]I still haven't been to some places that required the double jump.
[215:37.25]That's... that's expansive.
[215:43.23]I really need to update all this though, so let's get to this bench that's up there.
[215:52.58]whoa it's you ghost I see you face the place of your birth and now drape yourself in the substance of its shadow though our strength is born of similar source that part of you that crucial emptiness I do not share funny then that such darkness gives me hope within it I see the chance of change difficult journey you will face but a choice it can create prolong our world stasis or face the heart of its infection
[216:14.67]Oh, by the way, can't wait to fight you for the third and final time.
[216:18.59]Person that is in the game every one of these games that you have to fight the guy like three times and they give you a bunch of advice and the third time they don't hold back and they give all their strength and you kill them and they die and you got them and they say one last piece of advice and then you pop her fucking head off and take that crab claw head of hers and stick it on your arm and it's a second weapon.
[216:42.50]Spoiler.
[216:43.54]Uh, okay.
[216:53.41]Face the void and ascend unscathed.
[216:54.91]Could it unite such vast darkness?
[216:58.87]Oh.
[217:02.16]Yeah.
[217:03.96]Well, cool.
[217:06.50]At least I know it's down there now.
[217:18.22]I feel like one of those things was right here too.
[217:21.60]Maybe.
[217:26.43]Update the map.
[217:27.69]Game is now saved.
[217:30.41]Look at that vast underground down there.
[217:33.23]There's a little spot there on the left.
[217:36.25]Alright, well that was cool.
[217:38.03]That was cool.
[217:39.17]Well, so here we go.
[217:46.43]I have about 16 hours in the game.
[217:51.86]Let's talk about the game a little.
[217:53.88]Let's go over the assessment.
[217:54.68]About 15, 16 hours so far in the game.
[217:59.05]Get it.
[218:00.49]Get this game.
[218:02.33]This is just 2D bug souls.
[218:05.49]And for how much I've enjoyed this experience so far...
[218:12.52]I've gotten frustrated, of course.
[218:13.78]Come on, give me some credit.
[218:15.26]In just under 20 hours, I've really only gotten frustrated two or three times for a little while at a time.
[218:24.47]That's pretty good for a game like this that's hard and you have to find stuff and there's a lot of searching and backtracking and item collection.
[218:31.39]I would say it gets the seal.
[218:33.81]This is the absolute seal of approval.
[218:35.45]I'm going to continue to play this game.
[218:37.15]I don't think I'm going to continue to stream this game.
[218:41.61]If I do stream this game, it's going to be off schedule.
[218:44.85]So if I throw in a random stream on like a Wednesday or like a Sunday or something, maybe I'll just play it.
[218:53.50]But I'm going to leave that.
[218:55.74]We have a lot of games that have come out.
[218:57.56]There's a lot of interesting things to play that I'd rather play on schedule.
[219:02.83]For instance, Dark Souls 3's DLC Tuesday.
[219:05.77]There's been a couple of random indie games that might be fun that I wanted to check out.
[219:10.65]We'll see.
[219:13.35]But yes, final thoughts on a scheduled stream here.
[219:18.75]Bug Night is... That's not the name of the game.
[219:21.99]I don't know.
[219:22.85]I thought that was the name of the game.
[219:24.03]It's Hollow Knight.
[219:25.63]Hollow Knight on Steam.
[219:26.71]It is 15 bucks.
[219:29.47]And that's a fucking steal.
[219:32.19]for the amount of content that you get.
[219:35.01]Think about most $15 games that you've ever played.
[219:38.35]They might have, like, been fun for, like, an hour and 45 minutes, potentially.
[219:42.57]This is a fucking huge game.
[219:45.74]So, I will see you guys on Tuesday.
[219:52.72]That's the next scheduled thing.
[219:53.56]We're going to play Dark Souls 3 DLC.
[219:56.76]That should be fun.
[219:57.56]I gotta prepare myself for that.
[220:01.20]I might play Dark Souls 3 off stream just to get myself used to the game again.
[220:05.10]But, goodnight everybody.
[220:07.27]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[220:10.15]Have a good rest of your night.
[220:10.87]Thanks to everybody.
[220:11.39]Thanks for all the subs.
[220:12.11]All the new people that came in for subscriptions.
[220:14.85]And all the bits.
[220:16.25]Of course, you guys are incredible.
[220:20.23]I will see you dudes on Tuesday.
[220:22.92]Have a good night.
[220:24.24]Good luck.
[220:24.88]And goodbye.
[220:41.70]Yeah.
[221:16.58]Thank you.
