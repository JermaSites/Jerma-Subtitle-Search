[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.81]Alright.
[00:02.55]So with the remaining time that we'll have here, let's do some lists.
[00:12.71]Anybody have any special requests?
[00:18.52]Because this was fun yesterday.
[00:25.62]Remaining time, in quotes.
[00:27.19]Yeah, well, I mean...
[00:29.63]I usually only stream for five to seven hours, depending.
[00:33.67]Alright, let me get that on the screen.
[00:37.61]We can find one.
[00:48.64]Snacks?
[00:49.34]Is there a snack one?
[00:55.00]Hmm.
[01:00.27]Candy.
[01:00.71]Ooh, that's a good one.
[01:02.67]I'll do candy.
[01:05.43]Anybody got a good candy one?
[01:13.43]Taco Bell menu tier.
[01:15.21]Do these even exist?
[01:20.93]Do the Soulsborne games?
[01:22.78]This is easy.
[01:26.22]Yeah, I can do this one in my sleep.
[01:29.32]Do I even need to have a tier list open for this?
[01:32.60]I could just save them.
[01:36.26]Dark Souls bosses?
[01:37.32]That's kind of cool.
[01:42.12]Alright, let's get... I want you to be able to see this shit.
[01:51.10]Uh... Window capture.
[01:53.81]Please do.
[01:57.09]And... Alright.
[02:08.27]Is that... Uh, what?
[02:12.75]How is that the window?
[02:17.93]That is not the right window.
[02:19.47]What the fuck?
[02:25.48]Uh, that is not the right window.
[02:26.70]What the fuck is this doing?
[02:40.07]Oh, here we go.
[02:40.57]Alright, so I'll do this one quick.
[02:45.76]Do I actually go get a tea, or am I a faker?
[02:48.06]Ooh, there is a Dark Souls boss one, is there?
[02:51.56]Yeah, we'll do this one first.
[02:56.83]Now, is this supposed to be hard, or which one I thought
[03:13.93]Uh, hold on.
[03:14.51]I don't want to have any Hulu ads.
[03:25.36]Bring this down.
[03:26.48]Holy fuck, there's so many.
[03:27.72]Uh, I don't even remember that this is too many icons.
[03:31.86]I can't do this by icon only.
[03:36.75]I'm sorry, guys.
[03:37.85]This is like picking a champion in Dota.
[03:40.23]I don't know.
[03:40.75]I don't remember who any of these are.
[03:44.61]holy shit uh well how do I get this on I can't even get this on the screen do it one at a time okay I'm gonna do I'm gonna do it really slow one at a time
[04:11.16]That's a decent spot for it to be.
[04:13.34]Right where you can see S. Alright, so let's get this off.
[04:18.00]Let's get me back on here.
[04:22.52]Like this.

[04:29.23]Okay, um... I have to change... Hold on.
[04:33.65]Why is this... This is fucked up.
[04:37.03]Hold on.
[04:37.97]Okay, let me... Wait.
[04:39.09]Wait.
[04:43.70]I'm not doing this for cleanup detail anymore.
[04:54.23]That's a lie.
[04:54.85]Alright, here we go.
[05:05.22]So, this is... Who is this?
[05:06.24]Who is that?
[05:06.62]You guys are going to have to help me here.
[05:14.80]Clean my ears?
[05:17.84]They should be clean now.
[05:20.10]Who is that?
[05:29.96]I'm not going to be able to do this.
[05:33.08]I'm going to find my favorite boss.
[05:35.38]That's all that matters.
[05:52.69]Bloodborne's not on this list.
[05:53.83]Never mind.
[05:56.30]Okay.
[05:58.18]I can't do this one.
[06:01.14]What is this?
[06:02.48]Jermania?
[06:04.18]Jermania.
[06:11.36]Alright.
[06:11.62]We'll try it.
[06:12.02]I'll bring this.
[06:23.24]Like that.
[06:24.34]Okay.
[06:26.30]So what is Jermania?
[06:30.68]Jermania tier list maker?
[06:34.30]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[06:36.25]It's like picking a champion in Dota again.
[06:40.25]Alright, who... Were there really this many people?
[06:47.71]Alright, I can do this.
[06:49.43]The pencil doesn't even get a slot apparently.
[06:51.03]I can do this, I can do this.
[06:51.85]Alright, let's go.
[06:53.88]Now, this is not about how strong a character is.
[06:56.16]Remember.
[06:57.82]This is like who I think is the coolest character.
[07:00.66]Not the strongest.
[07:01.92]Just who's the best character.
[07:07.97]Pac-Man has to be somewhere at least at A, S, or A. The egg... What does Z mean?
[07:16.85]Let's put egg at F for now.
[07:19.10]Let's put the spy at like D. Okay.
[07:25.06]All the Bias have to be down in the same spot.
[07:28.02]Is one Bia cooler than the other?
[07:33.58]This is a Bia.
[07:34.18]That's not Mario.
[07:34.82]That's a Bia.
[07:36.94]Santa.
[07:38.22]I mean, that's just Santa Claus.
[07:39.16]It's stupid.
[07:40.06]Elvis is just Elvis.
[07:43.03]Who is this?
[07:43.93]Oh, this is Captain Old Bones.
[07:46.55]Up here somewhere.
[07:52.13]Danny DeVito.
[07:59.16]This is the chicken.
[08:01.88]The Easter Bunny.
[08:03.18]F. Like F, F, F, F. Like below F. Like the pencil.
[08:07.60]Count Chocula is somewhere in A. Dick Dashley Richards is B. The Magician is definitely somewhere in C. All the serial characters are going to be probably on one list.
[08:21.91]Yeah.
[08:22.33]No, I have to change this list a little bit.
[08:32.22]yeah because they're all stupid and they all go on the same there's a complete different serial tier I think and it's definitely like up here yeah that's good that's definitely and then in the serial tier I will determine who I think is the coolest bald coin uh probably probably like f bald coin sucks I mean he just glows that's and he won so it's not fair
[09:00.94]This should probably be a President's tier, too.
[09:06.14]Dr. Roker is at least A. Orson Welles?
[09:17.20]Earthworm Jim, A. This is the wine guy.
[09:23.75]Not a cereal character, but definitely cooler than, like, the egg.
[09:29.50]All like video game characters also have to, besides Pac-Man, because you're up there.
[09:36.34]And yes, I get to put Pac-Man at S because in the Smash Brothers games, he's like a D. So he gets to go up there on mine.
[09:43.35]He gets to be S at my one.
[09:48.27]Okay.
[09:51.67]What?
[09:52.09]Pac-Man belongs up there.
[09:57.19]All video game characters are going to have to be on the same tier, too, because this is a shitload of them.
[10:00.77]And all humans, all real humans, I think should be on the same category, too.
[10:09.07]Alright, I'm going to make it, let's call it humans.
[10:13.67]Because this D F humans.
[10:22.75]Look.
[10:22.93]Look.
[10:27.10]There are too many, like, just real people.
[10:42.85]Why is it just a normal picture of his face?
[10:44.97]Alright, who else is just a regular person?
[10:54.47]Why is the spy on here twice?
[10:59.05]Oh, the PSVR absolutely goes up.
[11:03.97]I love this character.
[11:04.67]A. Mime belongs down with the pencil.
[11:09.67]What's going on?
[11:12.71]Why are there like... Everything's duplicated.
[11:16.64]What?
[11:19.86]Why are there three, four, everything's twice?
[11:28.04]It's broken.
[11:29.49]It's alright.
[11:30.11]I can do it.
[11:33.31]Alright, Burgah Boy.
[11:35.45]Yeah.
[11:36.79]Another bag down here.
[11:41.23]Miserable Mikey.
[11:42.65]Absolutely belongs up around... Well, hold on.
[11:46.28]Yeah, that's accurate.
[11:49.86]Speaking of this needs to be moved up.
[11:54.36]Glue Man.
[11:55.14]Yep.
[11:56.18]Glue Man goes up to S.
[12:02.57]I'm gonna put, like, at least two... Is this a beer?
[12:07.82]I can't tell.
[12:09.22]I think it is.
[12:14.20]The green screen belongs up there.
[12:16.42]Can't be stopped, so... This is just a human.
[12:27.59]What is that?
[12:32.04]B, B, C, D, B, B?
[12:35.50]B, C, B, D, B?
[12:37.20]What is that?
[12:39.25]B, D, D, B, B. What does that stand for?
[12:48.45]Bia Batman?
[12:54.11]I don't even remember making this, so it's down here.
[12:58.13]Bootleg Duck Dynasty Bia Batman.
[13:02.88]Holy shit.
[13:05.96]Alright.
[13:10.61]The egg is already up there, right?
[13:13.45]No?
[13:18.85]The movie... Oh, the movie's characters.
[13:21.11]Yeah, they belong up here.
[13:23.72]The pencil is just in the pencil category because it's the pencil.
[13:29.56]Chicken belongs way up here around B. Disco diaper is probably B. Hitman is a... No.
[13:36.52]Hitman, no.
[13:37.22]That character is stupid.
[13:38.50]It's just Hitman.
[13:39.46]There's nothing special.
[13:40.38]It's just... Oh, look.
[13:40.88]He's a bald guy with a suit on.
[13:42.27]No.
[13:42.89]Get rid of it.
[13:45.49]What was that?
[13:45.83]It was a giant rat?
[13:46.99]There's two giant rats, though.
[13:47.95]Which one's cooler?
[13:53.27]There are two chickens?
[13:55.01]Where's the other chicken?
[14:01.67]There are two chickens.
[14:02.99]Where?
[14:11.44]On the list?
[14:14.06]There are two eggs.
[14:19.52]There are two chickens and two eggs?
[14:23.20]Egg one, chicken one.
[14:25.20]Okay, there are two eggs.
[14:33.68]Where's the other chicken?
[14:35.81]Oh, fuck.
[14:41.79]Who the fuck is that?
[14:42.79]Oh, that's Ma- that's Kyle.
[14:45.21]Yeah, that character's pretty cool.
[14:49.32]Uh, Jack's Jerma goes up here.
[14:51.64]Nah, nah, that's too much.
[14:57.20]What does this say?
[15:00.53]Monopoly guy, D.
[15:07.15]Mr. Mike is already up there.
[15:08.33]The mime's already up there.
[15:09.31]Dick Richard's up there.
[15:12.87]Boo is up there.
[15:13.55]That's just a person.
[15:15.17]This is Gabe Newell.
[15:15.99]Where's Gabe?
[15:16.43]Gabe Newell already up there.
[15:17.29]Yeah, but B. Bird Boy's there.
[15:20.57]I don't think President Number Seven, whatever his name is.
[15:27.14]No.
[15:29.24]Down there, this looks good.
[15:31.54]This is James Madison, I think.
[15:33.08]So... Granny...
[15:39.15]From the Vumps?
[15:46.53]Okay, there is just like a Vumps.
[15:49.12]We can collectively use them.
[15:56.82]Chocula's under Serial.
[15:58.10]Let's just get all the Serial characters out here.
[16:02.52]Tony the Tiger's there.
[16:09.71]Cheese Nips is up here.
[16:11.35]No, that's Cheese It's.
[16:14.66]Definitely somewhere in S. This is the same... This is a different pose of the same person.
[16:29.84]Frank Pizza?
[16:33.98]Frank Pizza is not that great.
[16:36.58]Not a human, though.
[16:38.85]Does Danny DeVito... Alright, the two-person horse.
[16:44.24]I love that character so much.
[16:47.92]Demon Lord Zaraxos, I mean, just because of his lore quality, needs to be somewhere up here.
[16:59.36]Another president, right?
[17:05.35]James Giraffe?
[17:06.41]James Gar... Oh, okay.
[17:10.02]Uh, other presidents.
[17:13.82]Is Dr. Roker up here?
[17:15.36]Yep.
[17:18.55]This is another, another beer, but he's already there.
[17:26.14]I think this is, uh, like Star Version 1.
[17:28.74]Winston.
[17:32.30]Winston.
[17:40.09]There's another one guy.
[17:43.87]Are there only two cereal characters?
[17:50.48]Oh, there's, what, Cheese Nips down here.
[17:59.18]There's so many people.
[18:03.92]There's the Archmage.
[18:05.80]Hmm, let's see.
[18:08.88]Captain Crunch is double S tier.
[18:11.94]Yeah.
[18:14.20]Demon Grandpa is pretty high for me.
[18:18.54]It just is.
[18:19.54]Demon Grandpa is like S for me.
[18:23.33]Mr. Sneak Ban is probably A. There's...
[18:36.14]Paul Bearer, who would definitely be up for round B. He's a classic.
[18:44.13]I don't know what this is.
[18:47.23]Can somebody refresh my memory of what this is?
[18:54.47]No rewinds.
[18:56.72]Oh.
[18:59.16]Ah.
[19:00.94]Eh.
[19:03.22]There's the apple.
[19:05.83]Definitely down here somewhere.
[19:11.38]EZP?
[19:14.46]EZP belongs, uh, at least in A somewhere.
[19:20.48]Is it somebody with a diaper on?
[19:21.58]I don't know who that is.
[19:23.50]I swear to god, there's like ten serial characters.
[19:25.88]Did I only make like three?
[19:43.29]no serpents alright what about is the analyter somewhere in somewhere in a I like this list so far but I'm going to make a couple changes there's the wire head guy I could recognize I could recognize that vest anywhere see
[20:08.99]Captain Crunch, there you are.
[20:10.79]You are a serial character, but you are, like, one of the best characters ever.
[20:18.73]Benjamin Franklin is a person, president, but I mean, this motherfucker invented electricity, so you have to be up here.
[20:35.84]Carl Griffinsteed.
[20:39.73]Uh, probably somewhere like around here.
[20:42.09]There's a lot of C's, but there are a lot of C list characters.
[20:52.71]The EMT.
[20:55.46]Uh, EMT belongs in the human category, but it's gonna be like high Z. Disco Diaper's already up there, right?
[21:08.48]I thought so.
[21:10.78]Yeah, right here.
[21:11.96]It's like two different images!
[21:19.79]Okay.
[21:21.47]The movies are up there.
[21:22.35]I don't know who this is.
[21:24.39]Does Andrew Jacker reject?
[21:28.50]Eh, somewhere in D. The heavy weapons guy.
[21:32.42]Oh, okay.
[21:35.07]Probably should be right next to the spy.
[21:36.57]That makes the most sense.
[21:38.45]Here is from Lethal League, Mr. Candyman.
[21:42.67]I'd put you in the high C's here.
[21:49.05]Anybody else that I didn't put in here?
[21:51.05]I don't know who this is.
[21:53.71]I think that's a mistake.
[21:54.55]I don't think that person's on here.
[21:59.86]Sluggo, right?
[22:07.81]Did I get jermaMoon?
[22:09.17]Not yet.
[22:12.09]Oh, and this is IRL 3D CGI Pac-Man.
[22:17.36]Right.
[22:18.50]We have cartoon Pac-Man, but we also have 3D CGI made for the movie version of Pac-Man, which I think is way better.
[22:36.69]Censored?
[22:37.55]Yeah, that character sucks.
[22:40.98]Danny DeVito is not up there?
[22:46.44]You're just a fucking human.
[22:50.50]Alright.
[22:51.12]I think that's everybody.
[22:53.62]At least on this list.
[22:57.57]I can move some stuff around now.
[22:59.53]This is most of them.
[23:03.31]VR guy oh that's the VR guy I love that character yeah it definitely belongs up here up here oh nice I'm not changing that he's not he's not coming down for this did I get this guy to try another guy I don't think so no I did alright who am I missing anybody
[23:31.12]The PSVR is up here already.
[23:33.59]Yeah.
[23:35.17]There's two Danny DeVito's.
[23:48.33]Oh, okay.
[23:48.71]Yeah.
[23:52.05]This one, one in human.
[23:55.63]Okay.
[23:58.64]No 30s milkman.
[23:59.68]If a 30s milkman belongs down here anyways, doesn't matter.
[24:04.00]Now I have to make the real one.
[24:06.22]I can already tell you.
[24:06.90]It's going to look like this.
[24:15.88]No tooth goblin.
[24:20.13]So what we have available... Two person horse is probably my... I don't know why I have an accent now.
[24:27.17]Missing jermaMoon.
[24:31.38]Yeah, you belong.
[24:32.34]Definitely like on B. Alright.
[24:34.31]Two-person horse is my favorite character, I think, out of any of them ever.
[24:42.35]I've made my final decision on this.
[24:48.86]The Luman.
[24:49.88]Pac-Man.
[24:52.22]Mr. Cheez-It.
[24:54.26]Demon Grandpa.
[24:55.04]Yeah, bring him down.
[24:56.02]He doesn't belong up there.
[24:57.30]Neither do I.
[25:03.24]Hmm.
[25:05.74]I think that's it for the S's.
[25:14.25]Then you got Earthworm Jim, Dr. Elker, PSVR.
[25:19.29]Hmm.
[25:20.11]Easy Pete, I think, stays there.
[25:22.93]Disco Diaper comes up.
[25:26.30]Dermamoon comes up.
[25:33.82]I go down.
[25:36.28]Winston goes down very, very much so.
[25:38.96]All the way down to Lake C. They're doing the same pose.
[25:55.61]I'm alright with this.
[25:56.23]Maybe... Oh, hold on.
[26:01.36]I would put myself in front of Gabe Newell, but I'm not going to do that.
[26:07.66]Okay, Miserable Mikey comes forward.
[26:12.46]Anilander goes down.
[26:14.91]Mr. Sneak Band takes that place.
[26:17.43]Dag Richard goes down.
[26:30.26]Okay, I think that's it.
[26:35.74]Now it's... No, now it's good.
[26:41.64]I think I'm going to bring the... Okay.
[26:49.60]Yeah, I know.
[26:50.66]People are saying, whoa, hold on.
[26:53.14]Gabe Newell... I mean, Gabe Newell is not like the... Besides like the VR headset stuff.
[27:02.85]Gabe Newell used to be like all over the place.
[27:04.21]He used to be like everywhere.
[27:05.07]He used to be on interviews and talking.
[27:07.21]He was like a front runner in.
[27:08.21]And like the gaming industry.
[27:09.33]Now he kind of just does his thing, right?
[27:13.85]Did I get a cut on my hand?
[27:21.33]Put Gabe in the human spot.
[27:25.20]But he's almost like otherworldly.
[27:27.82]He's right.
[27:38.28]If Danny DeVito is going to be down in the human spot, then he should too.
[27:46.45]He is a human.
[27:47.64]Just a person.
[27:48.52]But he's a person that's not a president.
[27:51.24]That's important.
[27:53.22]I'm not done.
[27:53.80]I've got to move these around.
[27:55.44]Everyone's freaking out about this.
[27:56.46]Hold on.
[27:56.84]I'm going to fix it.
[27:58.24]Just hold on.
[27:59.70]Don't worry.
[28:00.70]It's going to be fine.
[28:01.72]Gabe Newell, just because you're on the human list doesn.
[28:04.37]Doesn't mean you're like bottom tier.
[28:05.79]Just means you're a human.
[28:06.97]And we have to put the humans in the right place.
[28:13.71]Alright.
[28:14.09]Where was I?
[28:14.45]B?
[28:14.63]B?
[28:16.57]B looks pretty good.
[28:23.67]B minus streamer?
[28:25.07]I'm a B plus streamer now.
[28:27.17]Hmm.
[28:31.10]Alright, let's go C. Magician stays there.
[28:38.64]Orson Welles stays there.
[28:40.36]Candyman comes up.
[28:41.56]Wine Guy replaces the tree.
[28:43.84]The movies actually goes in front here.
[28:46.90]The egg goes up in front there.
[28:48.26]Egg goes actually in front of the movies.
[28:50.08]Orson Welles stays there.
[28:53.88]The bumps take over that spot.
[28:55.18]Candyman comes down.
[28:57.36]Wirehead moves over the spot that was occupied by the wine guy.
[29:00.22]This is kind of just a person, so not that interesting.
[29:05.44]The character's cool and it's funny.
[29:07.21]But for this context here, Winston goes down here.
[29:15.05]Benjamin Franklin... I'm all... Okay, I'm alright with this, I think.
[29:24.82]Orson Welles is a human.
[29:32.06]Right.
[29:38.09]It is a human that's not a president.
[29:40.91]In fact, all humans.
[29:44.34]All humans that exist in real life or have existed in real life are going down here.
[29:51.19]And then they'll have their separate list.
[30:00.80]Benjamin Franklin has to come down here.
[30:02.36]All people that are real people.
[30:12.79]Shit, that means Dr. Oka has to come down.
[30:21.45]Captain Crunch is not a person.
[30:23.09]Captain Crunch is a fucking cartoon character.
[30:25.50]He's not a real guy.
[30:39.16]He's a cereal, fuck.
[30:41.23]You're right, you're right.
[30:41.85]They have to be on the same playing field.
[30:47.81]No, but the other cereal... Where's, um... Where's Woody the Woodpecker?
[30:51.15]Whatever his name is.
[30:52.90]Um, the Cuckoo Bird.
[30:54.74]I don't see him down here.
[30:57.98]No, the cereal characters don't need their own list.
[31:00.96]Because this is where they belong.
[31:04.17]I'm removing the cereal character list.
[31:17.14]Okay.
[31:18.12]That's good.
[31:20.26]Remove the human?
[31:20.90]Oh, there are too many.
[31:24.28]I can't... I can't put... I can't put, like, fucking... James Madison up here.
[31:32.55]No, they exist on their own plane.
[31:37.95]Two person horse is a human.
[31:39.13]That is a horse?
[31:39.51]No, it's not.
[31:39.77]That is two horse pieces.
[31:48.94]Jerm is a human alright alright I'm getting rid of that I'll get rid of it I'm just I am just categorizing people like oh you're a human you're a serial character you're a cartoon character that's not a tier list that's just what are they alright I'm getting rid of the humans
[32:16.16]You go back here.
[32:16.94]You... I still don't think I would put you any higher than that.
[32:22.11]But all the humans would be like C anyways.
[32:24.25]I'm going to have to get them all in C and then move them around.
[32:43.36]No, I mean, like, James Madison sucks.
[32:45.26]Like, the character's just stupid.
[32:48.90]Both of these two presidents' characters are filler content.
[32:51.80]It is the equivalent of a filler episode of a TV show.
[33:05.95]Van Buren rocks.
[33:06.93]That's right, you can love the filler episode.
[33:09.30]I love some filler episodes.
[33:10.52]It doesn't mean that they're not filler episodes.
[33:13.47]They're filler episodes.
[33:21.76]That like sucks too.
[33:22.58]It was just like a... All the presidents are like down at the bottom here.
[33:35.69]Make the humans row F.
[33:46.98]No, that isn't... No, Z is F. I'm changing Z to F. This is F. What are you doing?
[33:52.70]Excuse me.
[33:57.26]F. That is just F. I'm just going to remove the humans here.
[34:07.27]Star... I'm just... This is not final yet.
[34:10.15]Hold on, everybody.
[34:13.35]No Rewinds belongs in D, and then Orson Welles belongs probably up here.
[34:17.75]Okay, let's get her to the human tier.
[34:21.29]Now we can work with this.
[34:26.98]Okay.
[34:31.40]Do you guys understand why I had a human tier in the first place?
[34:34.44]Because now you're making me rate my friends.
[34:38.68]You understand?
[34:43.63]Having everybody in the human tier... Oh, well, I think, like, MLC stealth is definitely, like, cooler than Boo.
[34:50.00]No, but Boo is better than a talent.
[34:52.14]This is why I wanted to avoid that.
[34:55.62]Star belongs... You ain't gonna rate my friends.
[35:00.33]I'm doing a friend tier.
[35:21.30]Okay.
[35:26.77]Oh, yeah.
[35:27.17]That's Gabe Newell.
[35:27.81]Never mind.
[35:29.05]Alright.
[35:29.27]There's a friend.
[35:30.07]There's the friend here.
[35:32.22]What?
[35:33.94]Oh, fuck.
[35:35.10]What's going on?
[35:38.34]Hey, what's going on?
[36:01.84]Is that it?
[36:02.16]OK.
[36:10.87]Alright.
[36:11.83]Now I'm going to rename this to D. What are you doing?
[36:20.29]What are you doing?
[36:20.95]D. OK.
[36:35.59]Alright, so now I'm ready.
[36:43.40]We did B. I'm happy with that.
[36:45.64]C. C is, I think, pretty good.
[36:51.03]Friends.
[36:52.59]Doesn't matter where any of them are.
[36:53.69]Doesn't matter.
[36:54.05]It doesn't matter.
[36:54.67]They're all friends and they're all cool.
[36:56.63]And I like, they're all fun and I like them.
[36:58.77]Okay, cool.
[36:59.89]None of this list does not mean how, however high anybody is that they're cooler or liked more.
[37:05.59]This is just a non description list of people that not from any particular order are just on the list.
[37:11.91]Okay.
[37:12.37]There you go.
[37:16.29]And I'm going to put the friends down here.
[37:22.25]Because they are not part of this.
[37:23.81]They're down here.
[37:27.61]They're down there because this is the pencil tier and this is friends.
[37:33.17]So they're just in a separate category.
[37:36.21]The pencil tier is not part of A, B, C, D, S, D, E, F. Okay?
[37:43.71]It's just the pencil tier.
[37:45.16]The friend tier is not part of this stuff here.
[37:52.14]okay now that we've got that situated uh a b a b c d okay d is gonna be hard I'm gonna have to change some of this around okay
[38:27.27]mmm this is gonna be hard they they're all so bad all the bs have to be at the bottom this is too many of them Santa should should be like over here and devito should be here apple is like a little bit closer up just because cheese nips is like just a shit character but it's fun that's another bi down here okay I'm not I don't hate this so far
[38:55.16]Alright.
[38:55.94]Does anybody need to come down or up from F?
[39:12.11]No.
[39:16.35]Maybe the app.
[39:20.63]Okay.
[39:21.37]That's it.
[39:22.19]It's done.
[39:22.51]I'm happy with it.
[39:27.76]This is D+.
[39:30.67]I would put Frank pizza in a D+.
[39:41.19]Bald coin's probably at the bottom here.
[39:42.44]Not that I don't like bald coin, but... Maybe up here.
[39:46.20]The apple should be up here.
[39:49.74]No, James Garfield's a president.
[39:50.94]Down here.
[39:54.74]Andrew Jack Reject is also a president, right?
[39:58.48]But... The coolest one out of all the characters.
[40:04.44]Because it's just... I made him in Fallout, so... It works.
[40:09.90]It still works.
[40:16.78]Joop, joop, joop, joop, joop, joop.
[40:18.16]What's going on?
[40:22.34]Where's Batboy?
[40:23.83]Down at the pencil.
[40:27.48]I do need to find out what the worst character that ever is, though.
[40:31.02]That's important.
[40:36.05]Okay, let's see.
[40:38.37]The Monopoly guy's got to come up.
[40:40.35]Way up here.
[40:49.84]I think that's alright.
[40:55.68]Alright.
[40:57.60]We did that.
[40:58.80]Looks pretty clean.
[40:59.84]The worst character ever.
[41:18.13]It's the mime.
[41:18.75]It is.
[41:19.73]There's no context to this channel.
[41:22.59]There's no joke.
[41:25.19]At least these, like the censor bar.
[41:27.47]Garfield.
[41:28.61]Hitman.
[41:29.23]I played Hitman and it was fun.
[41:31.44]This is like a monster of a bunch of different other characters that I had.
[41:35.18]Sluggo is, he's been around.
[41:37.50]The pencil sucks, but the Easter Bunny, oh, it's gonna be close.
[41:40.54]Okay, but the mime is not, what's the mime?
[41:42.27]Is this a mime?
[41:51.07]There's no joke there.
[41:52.53]It's just a mime.
[41:54.74]Every single character on this list came from something or was made for a reason.
[42:01.08]This is another filler episode, but this is the kind of filler episode that you tell your friends to skip.
[42:06.89]You say, don't watch that one.
[42:08.41]You can just skip that one.
[42:11.25]Some filler episodes are great.
[42:12.35]That one, not so much.
[42:19.04]The pencil is...
[42:22.59]I don't think the pencil belongs down here I'm changing this category let's look at that look at that's that's look at how look at that like through the eraser and the the length and the top this is that's a it's a fun that's fun doesn't belong down here doesn't deserve its own category I don't think so
[42:54.64]It's better than NPM.
[42:56.16]And Danny DeVito.
[42:57.16]And Sam.
[42:58.62]And all the presidents.
[43:09.93]Okay.
[43:11.41]But who is the least worst character?
[43:21.38]Just because I don't know who this is, I'm going to put him down here.
[43:38.35]No, but Hitman is just Hitman.
[43:46.21]I'm done.
[43:46.43]That's it.
[43:49.11]From the available characters, that's it.
[43:53.75]Where it is?
[43:56.50]Take a screenshot.
[44:03.12]The pencil isn't in pencil tier.
[44:04.44]Yeah, I know.
[44:09.33]It's missing key characters, but I still did it.
[44:25.68]There.
[44:26.28]Just terrible.
[44:32.18]Demon Lords of Raxos should not be grouped up with the mortals.
[44:40.75]That's fine.
[44:44.67]Where's the snack one?
[44:46.05]Where's the next one?
[44:47.93]Snacks.
[44:50.63]Cereals?
[44:51.31]Oh, fuck yeah.
[44:54.19]Cereals.
[44:56.45]Let's do cereals.
[45:01.97]Oh, fuck yeah.
[45:09.09]Does this have them all?
[45:11.38]I don't think it has them all.
[45:16.78]Let me sniff this list for a second.
[45:25.25]No.
[45:25.43]Is there a better one?
[45:26.11]Is there one with more?
[45:31.91]Is there one with more?
[45:36.43]This one best cereals?
[45:42.69]Is this one better?
[45:46.49]Alright.
[45:47.15]That's more?
[45:47.89]That's better?
[45:51.51]Okay.
[45:51.61]Okay.
[45:56.15]I think I'm ready.
[45:58.38]All cereals.
[45:59.86]There's another one.
[46:06.78]I can't right click it.
[46:08.02]I can't click it.
[46:09.50]I can't click it.
[46:10.04]I got it.
[46:12.85]Alright, hold on everybody.
[46:13.55]Relax.
[46:15.33]Hold on.
[46:18.17]This is all cereal.
[46:19.99]Oh my god.
[46:46.57]Okay.
[46:48.69]S-S-S-A-B-C-D.
[46:51.25]Never had it.
[46:52.79]Probably trash.
[46:53.91]What is that?
[46:55.45]How would that not be never had it?
[46:59.39]You're just guessing?
[47:00.03]You're just saying that it's trash?
[47:05.30]I've never had this before.
[47:06.80]Well, I also think that's trash.
[47:09.48]No.
[47:10.38]That's not how it works.
[47:14.71]I'm deleting this one.
[47:15.55]Like, no.
[47:16.47]I've never had it.
[47:18.29]Or it's trash.
[47:21.21]Here we go.
[47:22.91]Uh, this is shredded wheat.
[47:24.44]Never had this.
[47:25.76]Shredded wheat.
[47:28.32]No, I never had it.
[47:30.52]Frosted chocolate strawberry.
[47:32.06]I've never had it.
[47:33.40]What's it going to go as they come in?
[47:35.96]Frosted chocolate strawberry...
[47:39.57]Frosted shredded wheat chocolate.
[47:40.95]Shredded wheat.
[47:41.71]Shredded wheat.
[47:42.99]Shredded wheat.
[47:43.97]Cheerios on crunch.
[47:46.03]Oat crunch.
[47:47.87]I've never had it.
[47:51.45]Cookie Crisp.
[47:52.15]Now is this 1996 Cookie Crisp or is this 2019 Cookie Crisp?
[47:56.27]That's a big difference.
[48:06.57]1995 Cookie Crisp is up here.
[48:08.86]2019 Cookie Crisp is down here.
[48:11.52]I'm going to assume by the box art that this is later, like 2010 plus.
[48:18.44]Belongs down here.
[48:21.54]Maple Bacon Donuts.
[48:26.50]Who the fuck buys that cereal?
[48:29.86]I don't think anyone's ever purchased that.
[48:31.10]Why would you buy that?
[48:34.13]Maple bacon donut cereal.
[48:36.64]That's like between Captain Crunch Cheerios.
[48:39.86]So you got Cheerios, Captain Crunch, Lucky Charms, like Raisin Bran.
[48:47.18]Maple bacon donut.
[48:50.78]That's, you never, why would you pick this one?
[48:54.83]I've never, no, it's probably trash.
[48:58.15]Chicken and waffles.
[48:59.19]Get, what are these?
[49:01.74]This is the same bullshit.
[49:04.34]People might think this is unpopular opinion here.
[49:06.78]This is the same bullshit of potato chip flavorings.
[49:10.26]Are we going down that road with cereals now?
[49:13.29]Well, this is ketchup, mustard, pickles, and dipped in acid and fiery red tomato.
[49:20.97]No.
[49:21.73]Like, I don't want that.
[49:22.63]Just give me fucking sour cream and onion.
[49:25.10]Well, this is mesquite barbecue chili lime bacon.
[49:30.04]Alright.
[49:33.46]There's a BLT flavored potato.
[49:35.24]There's BLT flavored potato chips.
[49:36.90]That makes no sense.
[49:42.56]So it's a mayonnaise and lettuce flavored potato chip?
[49:50.81]Oh yeah, you get the chicken and waffles cereal.
[49:54.41]We're going too far.
[50:01.06]This cereal is called Good Friends.
[50:07.49]Cocoa Puffs.
[50:08.11]I'm going to start it at B. Put it on the friend tier.
[50:17.63]Wheaties.
[50:20.38]I don't buy Wheaties.
[50:22.48]I don't read Wheaties.
[50:23.48]Reese's Puffs.
[50:25.34]See you later.
[50:25.92]Tricks.
[50:26.28]See you later.
[50:27.96]Alphabet's never had it.
[50:30.42]These are Apple Cinnamon Cheerios.
[50:31.82]They're okay.
[50:33.92]Apple Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
[50:35.20]It's a fucking dumb potato chip flavoring.
[50:43.47]Banana Nut Cheerios.
[50:44.79]That sounds pretty good.
[50:53.71]Blueberry.
[50:55.03]Up at B. Chips Ahoy.
[50:57.27]I've had it a couple times, but it was alright.
[51:04.51]Cinnamon Toast Crunch is God tier?
[51:06.69]Yes.
[51:08.41]Apple Cinnamon Toast Crunch is not
[51:12.88]God tier.
[51:18.20]Have you had it?
[51:23.19]I've had it.
[51:23.77]I've had it.
[51:27.17]Why is Apple Cinnamon Cheerios C tier?
[51:29.47]Because that's Cheerios with Apple Cinnamon.
[51:32.47]This is... This is fucking French toast with cinnamon and apples on it.
[51:37.67]Which is actually fucking really, really good.
[51:46.53]Kix.
[51:48.21]I used to love Kix, actually.
[51:54.37]Kix and Pops.
[51:55.51]Is Pops on here?
[52:00.61]Blueberry Cheerios.
[52:03.07]Now, get this green ketchup.
[52:05.17]I don't want it.
[52:08.02]Shredded Wheat.
[52:08.76]I don't eat these.
[52:10.64]Cocoa Pebbles.
[52:13.50]I'm going to do both of these right now.
[52:16.41]Cocoa Pebbles and Fruity Pebbles.
[52:18.71]Are we talking about the first 30 seconds?
[52:22.25]Or are we talking about the rest of the time you eat the cereal?
[52:26.85]Because once you pour the milk in and you eat the cereal, it's like SS.
[52:33.74]But after about 25 seconds, it becomes something that you want to just throw in the trash.
[52:39.16]They just become hard boogers that you're eating.
[52:44.73]It's just individual boogers.
[52:46.65]That's what they turn into.
[52:51.39]The shit that you pull out of your nose is what each, every single pebble turns into in about two minutes.
[53:00.01]I'm sorry, but that's just, I'm telling you how I feel.
[53:13.56]That's a big deal with cereal.
[53:14.68]It is.
[53:17.05]Eat them dry.
[53:18.97]No, eating them dry is like eating glass.
[53:21.73]No.
[53:35.73]Those can move.
[53:36.59]I'm just... I need to... I have to see it first.
[53:40.69]Is this another one of those things where it's just doing them again twice?
[53:44.71]Why is this happening to me?
[53:54.24]Golden Oreo.
[53:55.28]I've had Oreo O's before, but not these ones.
[54:00.50]What's the difference?
[54:02.28]Marshmallow Fruity Pebbles?
[54:04.94]I'm going to bump this up just because... No, I've never had it.
[54:07.74]Never mind.
[54:08.79]That sounds pretty good.
[54:12.50]Nilla.
[54:13.24]Never had it.
[54:15.54]Nutter Butter cereal.
[54:20.44]This is another thing with cereals.
[54:22.70]They just put cookies in a bowl.
[54:29.52]Cookie Crisp.
[54:30.36]Yeah, I understand.
[54:33.34]But that's not good.
[54:35.34]Putting cookies in a bowl with milk on them.
[54:41.10]That's not a breakfast.
[54:45.07]Maybe that's why they changed the recipe.
[54:50.11]Oreo Ores, they're very good though.
[54:53.19]They are insanely good.
[54:56.28]Peanut Butter Fruity Pebbles.
[54:59.44]They're all gonna be on the same.
[55:01.10]They're not, I can't get over it.
[55:06.12]This is, is this real?
[55:09.29]There's only one place you should ever put a Sour Patch Kid in your fucking mouth, and that's at a movie theater.
[55:14.53]A cereal for this shit.
[55:19.70]You better eat that at the movie theater, or there's no reason to buy that.
[55:26.94]Oh yeah, that goes up here.
[55:35.01]They had to produce that.
[55:38.02]There had to been enough interest in that for them to make like 500,000 boxes of this.
[55:53.88]I don't need to taste it.
[55:58.31]Bran flakes.
[55:59.13]I don't think we've ever had this brand before.
[56:02.73]Honeycomb.
[56:03.21]I think I've had it a few times.
[56:04.35]It was alright.
[56:06.41]Uh, Cheerios ancient grains?
[56:11.57]That's what it says.
[56:12.27]It says ancient grains.
[56:20.13]Uh, is that supposed to mean it's healthier because it's using old spices or something?
[56:28.50]Or does it mean ancient grains like we've been storing them for a long time?
[56:33.52]I haven't had it.
[56:34.52]Cheerios protein.
[56:38.81]Never had them.
[56:42.95]Uh... Chex.
[56:46.60]I'm gonna have to... I'm gonna... Oh, I don't buy Chex.
[56:48.98]I don't eat Chex.
[56:54.68]No.
[56:56.28]Belongs on the floor of your bathroom.
[56:57.78]Not in a cereal.
[56:59.80]This tile motherfucking cereal.
[57:01.98]Get out of here.
[57:02.48]Alright, here we go.
[57:05.66]Chocolate Cheerios.
[57:11.13]um that doesn't sound very good but I haven't had them now this is chocolate lucky charms I have had these I think once they weren't as good as the regular ones I like the regular ones better but they weren't bad we'll keep them here for now chocolate toast crunch
[57:46.77]That just doesn't make... Cinnamon toast crunch.
[57:49.93]Chocolate toast crunch.
[57:51.67]What is chocolate toast?
[57:57.20]Chocolate toast, to me, is... I guess when you... Nutella on your toast or something?
[58:05.10]Is that what it's supposed to taste like?
[58:09.10]Not for me.
[58:10.62]Churros cereal.
[58:12.58]I haven't had it.
[58:14.73]Here we go.
[58:15.39]Cinnamon toast crunch.
[58:19.46]It belongs up here.
[58:23.24]Nothing's S tier yet.
[58:24.56]Not yet.
[58:26.57]But it could be.
[58:27.69]Very soon.
[58:29.99]Count Chocula is up here somewhere in C, I think.
[58:34.11]Cotton Candy Crunch.
[58:37.29]That sounds disgusting, but I'm gonna buy it at the grocery store tomorrow.
[58:43.91]That sounds truly awful, but I'm gonna get it.
[58:46.71]Crunch Berries belongs up here.
[58:49.76]And what's with this... Wait.
[58:52.47]Oh, this is the different trick.
[58:53.27]Okay, one of these tricks is... I know this.
[58:56.45]Okay, so the two tricks is... One of them was... We want a healthier cereal.
[59:02.53]And we want less dye in our cereals.
[59:04.77]And we want it to be healthier.
[59:06.05]And no more colorings.
[59:07.07]And make it, like, less sugar.
[59:08.93]And then they did that.
[59:09.61]That's this one.
[59:11.91]And then everybody had it and said, No, I don't want that.
[59:14.03]Give me the fucking colors back.
[59:15.37]Give me, like, the sugar back.
[59:17.66]And so they ditched that and started doing the old one again.
[59:21.55]That's what happened, right?
[59:28.61]There was such an outcry about how gross and not colorful and not yummy and delicious and sugary that this one was, the healthy one that everybody wanted.
[59:38.16]Give us a healthier alternative to Trix!
[59:40.58]I want no food dye!
[59:42.64]Okay, well here's one without food dye.
[59:44.20]Ew!
[59:45.10]Oh, that looks like bird poo!
[59:46.81]Give me the other one!
[59:54.97]I have never had them.
[60:01.13]Fucking consumerists.
[60:05.34]Uh, Frankenberry is... It's alright.
[60:12.26]I have two Trix's on the list.
[60:15.72]Yeah, I know.
[60:16.77]That's the different versions.
[60:18.25]This is the one, the healthy one, right?
[60:21.27]Go look it up, that happened.
[60:24.08]French Toast Crunch is better than Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
[60:38.67]In fact, it might be the first S. I think so.
[60:57.39]It's okay to be wrong.
[61:01.89]French Toast Crunch is insane.
[61:06.19]It's insane.
[61:07.81]It's really good.
[61:11.61]That's really good.
[61:12.95]Cinnamon Toast Crunch is fucking good too.
[61:16.41]Cinnamon Toast Crunch is really, really good.
[61:20.33]I just think that French Toast Crunch is a little bit better.
[61:22.63]Just a little.
[61:28.43]Uh, cocoa wheats, never had it.
[61:31.25]Total, I've actually never eaten total.
[61:37.43]Frosted Cheerios.
[61:39.58]Ooh.
[61:43.12]They're gross.
[61:47.08]I've had them a few times.
[61:48.70]It's not, they're not good.
[61:51.20]They're not good.
[61:53.48]Just eat Frosted Flakes.
[61:57.68]Frosted Flakes are better.
[61:59.36]They feel better in your mouth.
[62:00.54]They crunch better.
[62:03.06]I don't like them.
[62:05.50]If you like them, I'm glad you do.
[62:08.10]Maybe it's D-.
[62:09.32]It doesn't belong on the movie candy box.
[62:14.14]Yeah.
[62:14.54]I'm not a big fan.
[62:19.74]Fruity Cheerios.
[62:23.36]Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheerios.
[62:24.96]Devin had them.
[62:26.98]Now, here's the issue here.
[62:28.46]This is Golden Crisp, but where's Smacks?
[62:32.36]Because they're the same cereal.
[62:33.80]One of them is just way better.
[62:34.98]And do you know which one it is?
[62:42.33]Which one is way better?
[62:46.25]I'm glad we have some intelligent people in this chat.
[62:50.53]Smacks are way better.
[62:51.45]So these are coming up at probably around like D plus, C minus.
[62:56.09]Smacks are going to be up at like B. Golden Grahams suffer from the same problem that Fruity Pebbles suffer from and they get soggy in about 10 seconds.
[63:06.70]I have eaten Golden Grahams before and they taste great, but Golden Grahams are the worst offender for that.
[63:13.95]You will pour your milk on these fucking things.
[63:16.91]Turn around to go get a spoon.
[63:19.15]Turn back around and it's porridge.
[63:23.16]It just is.
[63:23.72]I can't.
[63:24.06]I don't.
[63:25.00]It's got to be crunchy.
[63:28.17]I don't eat cereal dry.
[63:29.95]I don't do that.
[63:32.46]What you have to do with Golden Grahams, and with some of these others, this is a tactic.
[63:37.14]I mean, I did this a lot when I was in college, is you get a mug of milk.
[63:42.81]And what you do is you have like a drinking mug, take whatever cereal you want, sprinkle a little bit on the top, like make a little top layer of cereal on top of the milk in your cup, and just like sip it and crunch it and stuff.
[64:00.30]Therefore, you can keep putting a top layer.
[64:03.78]Sip, crunch, top layer, sip, crunch.
[64:06.83]It works out really well.
[64:08.39]It's the only way I can really eat those.
[64:10.09]Otherwise, that's too much work.
[64:13.65]Yeah, but then I'll get soggy cereal.
[64:15.11]I don't want to eat... Every time I get to the end of the... When you get like halfway down and it's just... When your cereal goes like this.
[64:25.75]That's not good.
[64:26.21]You don't want to eat that.
[64:27.96]It's not appetizing.
[64:32.04]Just eat it faster.
[64:33.16]No, you don't eat, you don't, don't, what do you mean eat it faster?
[64:37.65]No, you don't just wolf down food as fast as you fucking can.
[64:40.95]I gotta do this before I get soggy.
[64:45.33]No, you, you, you want to like eat and enjoy your meal.
[64:52.68]I don't eat cereal dry.
[64:54.86]I eat it wet.
[64:56.52]With milk.
[64:57.88]Not... I usually put almond milk on it.
[65:00.57]And that's not because I... That's a stomach and intestinal issue.
[65:03.77]That's not like a... Oh, I prefer whole milk.
[65:06.45]I just... I drink almond milk.
[65:08.07]I put almond milk on because of the stomach problems.
[65:11.59]Okay?
[65:12.82]Okay.
[65:13.82]Good.
[65:16.52]Lucky Charms.
[65:17.30]Frosted Flakes.
[65:20.14]What?
[65:23.30]That's real?
[65:24.78]Frosted Flakes.
[65:25.74]Lucky Charms.
[65:35.45]I need to get these, too.
[65:36.59]No, wait, I need to make a new list.
[65:42.82]I gotta add row below.
[65:44.78]This is gonna be the get next time at the grocery store list.
[65:55.77]Yeah, like, just order this.
[65:58.31]Wait, there's another one, too, right?
[65:59.27]Okay.
[66:02.59]Any others on here that I, like, do I want to eat?
[66:08.34]This is the next time I go to the grocery store I'm going to get these.
[66:12.93]No, I'm not eating Sour Patch Kids.
[66:16.57]Alright, Grape Nuts.
[66:19.99]Not really had them.
[66:23.19]Alright, Honey Bunches of Oats.
[66:25.18]The only one I've had is with strawberries and it's very good.
[66:28.38]I would put it somewhere in like high C. Maybe low B. The rest of them I have not had.
[66:41.33]Honey Bunches are good.
[66:41.97]Yeah, the Honey Bunches are both with strawberries.
[66:43.81]That's the one I ordered.
[66:50.66]The rest of these, yeah, I've never had them before.
[66:52.92]There's so many cereals.
[66:55.66]Honey Bunches are both s'mores and almonds.
[66:59.02]Get that.
[67:01.06]Kix is already up here, isn't it?
[67:04.26]Isn't Kix already up here?
[67:10.80]What's the difference?
[67:13.96]Honey kicks versus what's this kicks?
[67:20.95]Chocolate?
[67:21.75]Oh, no.
[67:22.25]I just had regular kicks.
[67:27.33]I've never had chocolate kicks before.
[67:31.65]I don't know.
[67:33.76]Alright, here we go.
[67:34.40]Time for a staple.
[67:36.10]Here come the staples.
[67:37.72]Honey Nut Cheerios belongs up here.
[67:43.60]I would say Honey to Cheerios is... There's so many options now that it's hard to put that higher.
[68:24.32]okay alright uh where was I honey nut cheerios uh medley crunch I don't know if that is fiber one no honey bunches of oats this one I haven't had it raisin bran crunch get that one I've always wanted to eat it I never have frosted flakes they go up here just regular frosted flakes no bullshit
[68:53.46]Tony the Tiger.
[68:57.06]They taste good.
[68:58.92]They're really, really, really yummy.
[69:01.78]They've been around for like 150 years.
[69:04.72]Like blacksmiths used to fucking eat this when they were making swords.
[69:08.88]So it belongs up here.
[69:13.28]Crave.
[69:20.41]I don't think it's as high as A, but it's alright.
[69:23.56]Crave is like a little disgusting, though.
[69:27.50]It gets gross.
[69:32.27]Like anything that's filled with something else.
[69:36.79]Something crunchy filled with this.
[69:38.63]It's usually very hit or miss.
[69:43.51]I'm going to put it below 2019 Cookie Crisp, I think.
[69:48.55]It's still good, though.
[69:50.04]And what is this doing all the way down here?
[69:56.89]Okay.
[69:59.71]I'm going to put this one down because it's kind of taken up too much space.
[70:03.40]You know that I haven't had these.
[70:08.28]Fruit Loops with Marshmallows.
[70:12.48]Man, they really are adding marshmallows to everything, huh?
[70:17.26]Never had it.
[70:18.26]Don't really want it, though.
[70:20.70]Frosted Krispies.
[70:22.76]That's not the only SS tier that's... Where is it?
[70:28.14]Is it on here?
[70:28.86]Where is Rice Krispie Treats cereal?
[70:31.72]That's the highest on the whole list.
[70:38.16]It's supposed to be all cereals.
[70:45.61]There's no Rice Krispie Treats cereal.
[70:50.77]Can I just pretend?
[70:58.23]Blind?
[70:58.63]Am I blind?
[70:59.55]Where is it?
[71:07.55]Rice Krispie Treats.
[71:09.85]It's purple.
[71:11.47]Oh, fuck yeah.
[71:14.68]Rice Krispie Treats cereal is unstoppable.
[71:21.88]It is insane.
[71:23.76]What do you mean he doesn't know?
[71:27.00]What do I not know?
[71:29.71]What's wrong with it?
[71:36.68]What's wrong with it?
[71:38.78]Rice Krispie Treat cereal is so bad.
[71:40.98]No, it's not.
[71:52.81]So this is Frosted Krispies.
[71:54.07]Never had it.
[71:55.67]Apple Jacks is very... It's very boring to me.
[72:02.19]It's boring.
[72:02.80]It's very boring.
[72:04.78]It doesn't do it for me.
[72:09.72]Now, I've had Frosted Mini Wheats.
[72:10.98]I've had the regular ones, just the default ones, which are these, right?
[72:13.64]And they're pretty good.
[72:15.85]These I would eat dry.
[72:18.65]It's one of the only cereals I would eat dry.
[72:20.73]Because you kind of have to.
[72:30.46]They're very good.
[72:32.32]It's good with milk.
[72:32.90]Yeah, I know it is, but I would eat these dry.
[72:37.99]Why am I watching this?
[72:38.77]I don't even eat cereal.
[72:46.09]Cocoa Krispies last longer than Cocoa Pebbles.
[72:56.59]So they're better.
[73:02.88]Uh, Measlicks?
[73:06.60]I don't know what it is.
[73:07.26]Frosted Mini Wheats.
[73:08.20]I don't have, never had them.
[73:09.24]They're like little bites.
[73:10.20]Never had them.
[73:12.18]Different flavors of little mini bites.
[73:15.91]All brand.
[73:16.43]I've never had any of these.
[73:17.99]Pops.
[73:18.49]Here we go.
[73:20.71]The second of our S tier is Pops.
[73:25.15]Wait a minute.
[73:46.91]yep a crackling oat bran no that's an old people cereal chocolate frosted flakes if never get them rice krispies they're too that's too default for me I wouldn't I would never it's not trash but I would never order them because they're not they're just too boring
[74:09.76]Crispix.
[74:11.02]Never had it.
[74:12.70]Some other weird version of Crave that I've never had.
[74:15.88]Smart Start.
[74:16.66]Never had it.
[74:17.17]Raisin Bran.
[74:18.91]Belongs.
[74:20.77]Somewhere up here.
[74:21.97]I would say B. Not quite as good as a Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but it's still good.
[74:31.09]Kix.
[74:31.77]That's regular Kix, right?
[74:37.01]Yeah.
[74:37.65]If this is just regular Kix, then these are great.
[74:41.60]They're definitely at least A or B. I'm going to put them in B for now.
[74:48.64]Never had any of these maple Cheerios.
[74:52.69]Fruit Brute.
[74:57.83]Wait a minute.
[74:58.21]Hold on.
[74:59.17]There's an Oops All Berries.
[75:03.05]Get this.
[75:03.72]Is it All Crunch Berries one?
[75:06.20]Oops All Berries.
[75:11.13]Alright, I'm going to put this in line of what I want the most.
[75:22.03]Captain Crunch is the best cereal.
[75:24.95]It is.
[75:25.96]It is the best cereal you can possibly eat.
[75:30.48]There are no other cereals that are worth eating more than just regular Captain Crunch.
[75:37.02]None.
[75:38.44]Some of them come close, as you see.
[75:41.45]Not close enough.
[75:47.80]I just teleport myself back to when I was like 12.
[75:51.92]And every one of those individual deep like earthy corn taste like starchy sweet flavorings.
[76:01.76]I can feel it right now.
[76:02.46]I know what it tastes like right now.
[76:03.50]I can taste it right now.
[76:05.66]Can you taste things in your head?
[76:07.20]I can taste that right now.
[76:09.82]Perfect.
[76:16.22]I can, I feel it.
[76:21.98]Is there another one of those?
[76:24.08]Okay.
[76:26.30]Regular Cheerios.
[76:33.29]I just don't, I won't, I don't want, they're not bad.
[76:36.03]Look, I would put them high on D.
[76:39.16]But they're... No, I don't... Look, you can get, like... When there's... Okay.
[76:44.90]When there are Honey Nut Maple Chocolate Frosted Oreos, why would you get the regular Cheerios?
[76:51.31]I don't know.
[76:54.29]I mean, I guess they're... It's just cereal.
[77:03.36]Interesting, because all, like, the...
[77:10.69]I don't think I would even... You know how people say, oh, well, I wouldn't order it, but if you gave it to me and you're like, hey, you want a bowl of Cheerios?
[77:16.07]I'd say, yeah.
[77:16.69]I don't think I would say yes.
[77:20.29]That's one of those scenarios like you got anything else in a very not disrespectful way.
[77:27.36]Oh, you want some Cheerios?
[77:29.66]Cheerios.
[77:30.94]Like mustard box Cheerios?
[77:32.86]Or what are you talking about?
[77:34.79]Oh, yeah, just Cheerios.
[77:40.10]I'm not a baby.
[77:41.22]That's baby food.
[77:42.28]That's what babies eat.
[77:46.87]I'm a man.
[77:51.03]It's baby food.
[77:52.87]It's very good baby food.
[77:53.79]It's really good for you.
[77:56.83]But I'm too old for Cheerios.
[78:00.51]Or like the guy with the salt and pepper hair that's sitting there eating the bowl, talking...
[78:06.71]to what I assume is his five-year-old daughter.
[78:11.21]What are you doing, Dad?
[78:12.73]Just working on my cholesterol, honey.
[78:16.49]And then the commercial ends.
[78:17.71]Doesn't matter.
[78:18.41]That's the whole commercial.
[78:23.33]Those are the two scenarios.
[78:31.13]Which, by the way,
[78:35.35]I could tell you.
[78:36.51]I know that like, oh, eating Cheerios every day will lower your cholesterol.
[78:40.73]But no, no, no, that's not what it is.
[78:42.05]It's eating Cheerios every day and having a good, healthy lifestyle could lower your cholesterol.
[78:48.98]Right.
[78:49.36]Okay.
[78:50.42]Yeah.
[78:51.50]Hey, don't eat a Big Mac.
[78:54.26]You won't clog your arteries.
[78:56.46]Okay.
[78:58.52]If you stop smoking cigarettes, you might be able to run faster in a couple of years.
[79:05.19]Alright.
[79:06.05]That's good to know.
[79:10.79]So be healthy.
[79:13.63]Alright.
[79:17.11]What's the point?
[79:17.99]The point is that it's just like eat lettuce and be healthier and you'll be healthier.
[79:27.70]It's not the lettuce that's doing it.
[79:29.54]It's the fact that you're living a healthier lifestyle.
[79:34.84]Just be healthy.
[79:36.58]Yeah, Cheerios.
[79:38.10]Just be healthy, forehead.
[79:40.56]Replace the fucking heart here with like the forehead.
[79:52.69]Okay.
[79:55.75]Drink dried sugar.
[80:03.11]What is this one?
[80:04.33]I don't know.
[80:04.61]What's this one?
[80:05.05]Lucky Charms Magical Unicorn.
[80:09.39]Is Lucky Charms on here already?
[80:14.61]It's not.
[80:15.15]Is there just a regular Lucky Charms?
[80:22.99]I don't see the regular Lucky Charms anywhere.
[80:28.60]Well, I'm just going to say this is regular Lucky Charms.
[80:35.66]When is the cereal stream?
[80:41.71]Never.
[80:44.59]Lucky Charms, you just avoid all the fucking Cheerio bits and you eat the marshmallows.
[80:50.95]Everybody does that.
[80:51.67]And you end up with like 30 to 40 pieces of soggy, just beige cardboard that's in the bottom.
[81:00.30]And you just like, you don't feel bad.
[81:01.34]You're like, I kind of feel bad that I didn't eat that.
[81:08.17]It's alright.
[81:15.41]Peanut Butter Crunch is also up here pretty high.
[81:18.59]I would say somewhere... I think it's better than Crunch Berries.
[81:26.20]But is it better than Frosted Flakes?
[81:28.02]They both are.
[81:30.84]Frosted Flakes belongs down here.
[81:38.20]Okay.
[81:43.60]Okay.
[81:44.12]Just making sure.
[81:46.50]Alright.
[81:49.28]Fruit Loops.
[81:50.02]Regular Fruit Loops.
[81:50.82]I'm like, have I blinked?
[81:54.96]My eyes are getting so dry and watery and hard.
[81:57.48]That was a complete oxymoron.
[81:59.56]My eyes are getting really dry.
[82:01.06]Fruit Loops.
[82:05.75]Fruit Loops.
[82:21.54]They're better than Blueberry, but they're not... I don't... They're okay.
[82:24.58]They're alright.
[82:28.16]Multigrain Cheerios.
[82:29.30]Somebody said if I didn't put this at at least A, they were going to unsubscribe.
[82:36.57]I'm sorry.
[82:37.03]I don't... I've had them a bunch of times that they're just...
[82:40.34]They're just regular Oreos.
[82:42.04]Why do I keep saying Oreos?
[82:43.98]They're just regular Cheerios.
[82:46.86]But some of them taste like pumpernickel bread.
[82:59.31]It's not a bad thing, but I don't... Put fresh honey on them.
[83:05.23]I hope you're still here.
[83:13.10]I didn't put them down below in the trash category.
[83:16.22]I put them right here.
[83:20.38]They're definitely better than Boo-Berry.
[83:21.76]In fact, Boo-Berry should be at the bottom of D. That's only up there because he's friends with Count Chocula.
[83:32.82]You know what I mean?
[83:34.85]He's like sapping some of the clout from Count Chocula.
[83:37.89]That's the only reason why he's there.
[83:39.53]He's coming down.
[83:41.83]This is like part of Count Chocula's entourage.
[83:43.78]Where's the other one?
[83:44.66]Yeah.
[83:46.16]The Count Chocula entourage is not as good as Count Chocula.
[83:52.36]It's serial nepotism.
[83:54.82]Yes, that is exactly right.
[83:59.99]So we're gonna put Count Chocula where you belong.
[84:08.31]These are both the same serial.
[84:11.39]They just say it's a different flavor on the box.
[84:15.92]All they have to pay for is the art and the box work.
[84:28.14]Yeah, no.
[84:29.12]I mean, Frankenberry is kind of good.
[84:33.25]I would say of the Count Chocula fucking princes...
[84:38.63]Uh, Frankenberry is next in line for throne, I think.
[84:43.64]Once Count Chocula gets, like, fucking killed, it's, like, next in line.
[84:48.28]Here comes Frankenberry.
[84:52.99]Serial nobility.
[84:54.81]Yeah, once, like, the throne gets overthrown, like the English come in, then, yeah, Frankenberry.
[85:07.58]I don't, I've never had any of these.
[85:12.04]Uh, Apple Jacks is the same thing as Apple Jacks.
[85:19.36]They're the same cereal.
[85:20.44]So, this comes back down to here.
[85:24.26]To, right.
[85:28.15]It's the same cereal.
[85:30.45]There are so many, like, Cinnamon Toast, Cinnamon Apple Jack, there's so many of those.
[85:36.18]Everybody has their own version of cinnamon crusty apple crusts.
[85:43.70]That is how they blend together.
[85:45.02]And they all have a green box.
[85:46.55]They have a green and red box.
[85:49.09]Stop.
[85:49.71]Stop.
[85:50.05]Stop.
[85:50.41]Stop.
[85:51.15]Stop.
[85:52.49]Green and red box.
[85:53.55]Cinnamon.
[85:54.03]Apple.
[85:54.65]Apple cinnamon flavoring.
[85:57.05]Hold on a minute here.
[85:59.11]Where is it?
[86:00.53]Apple Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
[86:01.89]It's a green box.
[86:03.17]Green and red.
[86:04.29]Apple Cheerios.
[86:05.07]Apple Cinnamon.
[86:05.49]It's a green box.
[86:07.07]Hold on.
[86:07.43]Come on.
[86:10.69]Come on.
[86:14.67]They're all green boxes with red letters.
[86:16.63]And they're all apple fucking cinnamon flavoring.
[86:21.28]Sour Patch.
[86:22.28]Apple.
[86:22.84]It's too much apple.
[86:24.59]It's too sour.
[86:25.77]Don't you get it?
[86:26.47]Apples are sour.
[86:27.69]It's a green apple.
[86:28.49]Green box.
[86:41.90]That was great J. Jonah Jameson.
[86:45.12]Spider-Man is a menace to society.
[86:47.42]We need to get rid of him.
[86:48.92]Hey, wait a minute.
[86:49.44]That's me.
[86:51.23]spider-man no wait I'm not spider-man I hate him yummy mummy I don't I don't want it alright I definitely I've never had it before but I don't think I want like I'm not tall enough to see over the table frosted flakes he's supposed to be big and strong that's what's that saying
[87:26.14]What's this?
[87:27.22]Rice... Rice Krispies... What is that?
[87:33.45]That better be an apple fucking flavoring.
[87:36.25]Is it apple cinnamon?
[87:37.73]Tell me it is.
[87:38.47]Tell me that's apple fucking cinnamon.
[87:51.09]I've had Frosted Flakes with marshmallows.
[88:08.50]They're very bad.
[88:13.58]Too sugary.
[88:15.52]Way too sugary.
[88:18.51]Frosted Flakes are so sugary to begin with.
[88:20.55]And then the flavor from the marshmallow, it's too much.
[88:24.75]It is.
[88:25.21]I was so excited for these.
[88:29.29]I remember being like, holy shit, that's so awesome.
[88:32.03]And it's just too much.
[88:33.13]It's too fucking much.
[88:39.30]It's worse than movie theater food.
[88:41.15]No, it's not.
[88:42.71]Look, I'm just placing them right now, and then I'm going to go through and we're going to figure it out.
[88:50.49]Yeah, these, they're not that good.
[88:52.33]They really aren't.
[88:53.09]Not to me.
[88:53.55]I've never had these.
[88:58.73]Kellogg's Corn Flakes.
[89:02.03]Well, Kellogg's Corn Flakes I don't think are trash, but they're just unfinished Frosted Flakes.
[89:09.16]Their default character creator cereal.
[89:12.02]So they have to be below Frosted Flakes.
[89:22.60]They're not bad though.
[89:23.23]Corn Flakes are good.
[89:24.95]Corn is good.
[89:28.15]When it's mashed up and like mauled, like rocked up.
[89:33.24]It's when it's smushed up and then hardened and baked.
[89:36.46]I don't know how they make cereal.
[89:38.08]How do they make cereal?
[89:39.26]How do you, they take, they take corn and they crush it up and like smash it up into a paste.
[89:44.97]And then they like smear it over a long baking sheet.
[89:50.19]And then they put it in the oven and then they hit it with a fucking hammer when it comes out.
[89:54.49]And then they put that in a box.
[89:58.65]I don't know how to make, I don't know how, I don't know how cornflakes are made.
[90:09.28]It's just magic, I don't know.
[90:14.39]You're exactly right, thank you.
[90:16.83]It's good to be right.
[90:18.05]Why is Fro- no, okay.
[90:19.37]Should this belong on the movie theater tray?
[90:26.00]They're not good, but... Anything compared to Sour Patch Kids has to be terrible.
[90:37.54]In fact, this is so bad that it almost needs its own tier because I'm afraid to put anything else down here because it is a direct correlation and almost competitor to how gross this cereal is.
[90:50.73]Okay.
[91:06.23]Carrot Cheerios.
[91:07.09]I've never had them.
[91:08.11]What is that?
[91:08.85]Peach Cheerios.
[91:11.27]Okay.
[91:13.45]Running out of fucking fruits to, like, make your cereal themed after.
[91:21.38]Fiber One.
[91:21.98]I don't eat any of these.
[91:23.16]I've never had any of them.
[91:27.17]Never had any of them.
[91:29.25]Boys and Girls.
[91:31.05]Yoink.
[91:35.56]Can I do his voice?
[91:36.06]Can I do the voice?
[91:38.92]Let me hold on.
[91:40.72]Hey, kids.
[91:41.74]Have some smack cereal.
[91:43.52]Oh, yeah.
[91:44.31]Smack cereal.
[91:45.13]Is that close?
[91:45.51]Let's find out.
[91:47.27]Give me a link to a video right now.
[91:52.09]It's something like that.
[91:54.59]Anybody have one?
[92:01.75]I'll just do it.
[92:02.89]Anybody have one?
[92:07.96]Anybody got one?
[92:14.74]Smack cereal ad.
[92:18.38]Here we go.
[92:28.12]Hey!
[92:28.82]What do kids think about my Kellogg's smacks?
[92:30.80]Sorry, Diggum.
[92:32.06]I think we all have to agree.
[92:33.16]They look kind of weird.
[92:34.74]Uh-oh.
[92:35.38]Very scary.
[92:36.78]Scary-looking?
[92:38.04]Honey smacks are the fun-tasting part of a co- No, no, no, no, no.
[92:40.89]That's not the right one.
[92:45.03]Here's another.
[92:45.59]Here we go.
[92:46.23]Diggum, boy.
[92:46.99]Diggum, boy.
[92:47.47]Diggum.
[92:48.05]Whoa!
[92:48.57]Kellogg's smacks.
[92:49.87]Wow.
[92:50.35]Ooh, how I love those yummy sweet and puffs of wheat.
[92:52.83]I told you.
[92:54.31]Oh.
[92:55.23]I had it close.
[92:56.07]No, I can't do it.
[92:57.51]It's been too long.
[92:59.01]I've been talking for too long.
[93:01.45]Just do Marge Simpson.
[93:02.73]Pretend I did it.
[93:03.55]I had it right.
[93:26.52]Raisin Bran.
[93:27.02]I already put Raisin Bran.
[93:28.08]But what's this?
[93:28.52]Frosted Flakes.
[93:30.05]Banana Cream.
[93:32.29]Holy.
[93:33.17]Really?
[93:34.21]Get that tomorrow.
[93:36.09]Banana Cream Frosted Flakes.
[93:37.67]That sounds really good.
[93:45.86]Wild Berry Fruit Loops.
[93:48.68]You just change the food dye.
[93:50.18]And that's all you did.
[93:51.28]I don't want it.
[93:54.48]None of these.
[93:54.92]I'm not going to order them.
[93:55.64]I don't want them.
[93:56.98]These are doubles anyway, so it don't matter.
[94:01.08]Pop-Tart cereal.
[94:03.45]I'm not interested.
[94:04.61]I really am not at all.
[94:09.49]I'm not interested.
[94:10.15]I'm not.
[94:10.39]People are going to be mad about that.
[94:17.64]Lúcio?
[94:18.50]Lúcio O's?
[94:27.15]You can buy, this is like on the shelves?
[94:40.06]What are they?
[94:43.70]Is it like Cheerios?
[94:47.10]It's a gamer cereal.
[94:49.26]I've never had it and I don't think I'm gonna buy it.
[94:52.96]I've never seen that before.
[94:54.76]That's probably only in select locations.
[94:57.56]Strawberry Krispies.
[95:01.62]I kind of have to try those.
[95:04.01]Peeps cereal.
[95:05.19]Goodbye.
[95:06.47]Get out.
[95:07.63]Out.
[95:08.35]Out.
[95:08.97]Peep.
[95:09.29]No.
[95:10.29]It's awful.
[95:17.99]Raisin Bran Crunch.
[95:20.05]Is that just regular Raisin Bran Crunch?
[95:21.59]Because it's really good if it is.
[95:22.51]I lost it.
[95:30.68]There it is.
[95:31.50]No, where is it?
[95:34.42]I lost it, where'd it go?
[95:43.44]Where the fuck did it just go?
[95:45.40]Raisin Bran Crunch.
[95:47.98]Second row?
[95:56.39]That's the third row, that's not the second row.
[96:02.59]This is up here in A. It's awesome.
[96:07.73]Raisin Bran.
[96:11.09]Red, white, and blue crunch.
[96:12.91]Is this like a 4th of July crunch?
[96:16.69]I've never had it, but I mean, it's Crunch Berries, right?
[96:22.12]Sprinkled Donut Crunch.
[96:29.46]Sprinkled Donut.
[96:30.56]Alright, get that tomorrow.
[96:32.51]I want to try that.
[96:33.07]That sounds weird.
[96:33.69]What is that?
[96:40.04]Strawberry... Strawberry what?
[96:42.96]Why is this upside down?
[96:45.42]Why does it look like it's a packet that you rip?
[96:47.40]Is this like a cereal bar?
[96:50.90]Strawberry... What does that say?
[96:55.07]Is this a cereal bar or is this a cereal cereal?
[97:03.08]Yeah, no holiday crunch.
[97:04.08]That's strange.
[97:07.80]It's just a bag.
[97:08.68]Well, I don't... I don't really want that.
[97:10.72]I don't know what that is.
[97:12.04]Strawberry cheesecake crunch or whatever?
[97:14.86]Same with this one.
[97:15.32]What is it?
[97:16.24]Sugar cookie toast crunch.
[97:20.08]No, that's bullshit.
[97:23.04]You can't call everything French toast.
[97:28.28]Toast crunch.
[97:30.83]Candy corn toast crunch.
[97:32.43]Sugar cookie toast crunch.
[97:35.27]French toast crunch.
[97:38.00]Is it toast or is it a cookie?
[97:39.14]What the fuck is it?
[97:39.82]Just have it be sugar toast crunch.
[97:42.90]Or cookie toast.
[97:43.84]Sugar toast.
[97:45.24]Buttered toast crunch.
[97:47.02]That's a better name.
[97:49.88]Like, why?
[97:50.74]Sugar cookie toast crunch?
[97:56.12]Peanut butter pops.
[97:56.66]I've never had them.
[97:58.90]Uh...
[98:00.50]Hostess has a honey bun cereal?
[98:03.30]Oh, that's gross.
[98:04.10]A bunch of mini honey buns.
[98:08.22]You ever eaten one honey bun before?
[98:12.75]They're delicious, and then you get a stomachache.
[98:19.73]While you're eating it, it's the best thing ever.
[98:22.99]But then for some reason, you just feel bad.
[98:29.04]I'm going to try it.
[98:31.87]Wait, the little powdered donuts is a cereal?
[98:36.05]Oh my god.
[98:40.57]I want to try that too.
[98:41.51]I'm going to try these.
[98:45.00]Sardine Toast Crunch.
[98:48.64]Pumpkin Spice.
[98:50.74]I don't want like a latte cereal.
[98:53.70]Okay.
[98:54.92]The rest of these I haven't had.
[98:56.48]So, say goodbye to these.
[98:59.04]This is what we should be concerned with up here.
[99:04.18]Try them on stream.
[99:07.48]I mean, I could.
[99:10.47]There's a lot there.
[99:12.25]How many cereals am I buying?
[99:13.41]I have to eliminate some from that list.
[99:19.69]Alright, most importantly, let's see.
[99:21.19]Cap'n Crunch is definitely up there.
[99:22.63]Rice Krispie Treat cereal is definitely up there.
[99:24.98]Two best.
[99:30.87]French Toast Crunch Honeymade S'mores.
[99:34.07]And Honey Smacks, I don't think belongs there.
[99:49.21]Reese's Puffs, I think, are up there too high, too.
[100:03.27]I would say Captain Crunch Peanut Butter Crunch is a superior peanut butter flavored peanut buttery kind of cereal than Reese's Puffs.
[100:17.25]I like the flavor of the peanut butter from the Captain Crunch one.
[100:24.83]Trix is not better than any of these.
[100:29.54]Cinnamon Toast Crunch is probably better than Pops.
[100:32.16]Raisin Bran Crunch is probably better than Pops.
[100:34.57]Pops is probably better than Crunch Berries.
[100:36.67]But Honey Smacks are probably better than Crunch Berries.
[100:39.31]And Trix are not better than Crunch Berries.
[100:41.25]Therefore, this list is correct.
[100:54.76]Raisin Bran is dropping down.
[100:58.25]Raisin Bran Crunch is already up here.
[100:59.39]This is the cooler one.
[101:03.27]Again, this is the unfinished one.
[101:19.50]What?
[101:22.86]Oh, this is regular tricks.
[101:24.02]This is Fruity Shapes tricks.
[101:32.71]Which one's better?
[101:34.74]Fruity shapes.
[101:36.92]Get this out of here.
[101:57.65]Honey Nut Cheerios, I think, are worse.
[101:59.74]That's a B- though.
[102:00.82]That's still very good.
[102:06.07]Would I put Cocoa Puffs in front of Frosted Flakes?
[102:12.01]No, I wouldn't.
[102:13.57]I would not.
[102:16.53]Justify Trix being higher than a C. Because Fruit Loops are a C. And Trix are just a ten times better version of Fruit Loops.
[102:28.42]It's the same cereal, except this one's just better.
[102:38.19]The reverse is true.
[102:47.78]Thank you Concrete Car for the five community subs.
[102:50.56]I think I missed subs earlier too.
[102:52.00]I was too engrossed.
[102:53.62]But thank you Concrete Car for the five community subs.
[102:57.13]Thank you.
[103:03.27]Yeah, Fruity Pebbles, Fruit Loops, and Trix are all the same market.
[103:07.36]They're all the sugary, fruity cereals that don't taste like fruit.
[103:13.00]They taste kind of just like candy.
[103:16.53]These ones taste like candy.
[103:19.55]These ones taste like bread.
[103:21.73]And these ones taste like sugary, yummy fruits.
[103:26.95]Now, do you want a bread-flavored fruit snack, or do you want
[103:31.38]You know, like a candy.
[103:33.06]Or do you want a lighter, crispier... Not even close.
[103:53.22]Back in the medieval days, we ate bread cereal.
[103:57.10]No, back in the medieval days, you ate, like, an onion and, like, you put an onion into a boiling bowl of water and, like, ripped up a bunch of bread and put it in there, too, and boiled it for, like, four hours.
[104:15.57]Sometimes there'd be a rabbit in there.
[104:18.49]And that was awesome, if you had that.
[104:23.71]It's a French onion soup.
[104:25.49]Where do you think it came from?
[104:27.55]Alright.
[104:28.33]I am not going to let Chad influence me.
[104:30.01]I think Trix is a very, very good cereal.
[104:32.65]I would put Trix up here with... Changing my mind.
[104:39.52]This belongs in front of Trix.
[104:42.70]It does.
[104:42.98]It really does.
[104:44.82]I'm not going to let you guys influence me.
[104:48.61]That went from an A- to a B+.
[104:50.89]Vice versa.
[104:56.12]Oreo O's.
[104:56.92]It's just too much, though.
[104:57.92]They're very good, but you can only eat one bowl of Oreo O's a week.
[105:03.32]Or it's too much.
[105:07.54]And for that reason, I'm up.
[105:15.06]But they're very, very, very good.
[105:20.79]I've never had these before.
[105:21.95]Why are they up here?
[105:24.37]Get them tomorrow.
[105:26.55]Banana Nut Cheerios, Banana Cream Frosted Flakes.
[105:37.18]Okay.
[105:38.38]This is how I do these lists.
[105:40.70]Are tricks better than Cocoa Puffs?
[105:44.02]Yes or no?
[105:47.90]No.
[105:49.22]Are tricks better than kicks?
[105:52.15]They've got the same name.
[105:55.23]They both have X in their name.
[105:57.64]Which one is the better X?
[106:02.08]Hmm.
[106:10.55]Tricks.
[106:11.97]Are kicks better than honey bunches of oats with strawberries?
[106:14.07]No.
[106:16.57]Are kicks better than mini wheats?
[106:17.77]Frosted mini wheats?
[106:18.39]Yes.
[106:19.75]Are frosted mini wheats better than honey nut Cheerios?
[106:21.69]No.
[106:22.88]Are frosted mini wheats better than Oreo O's?
[106:26.21]Yes.
[106:27.97]There's your list.
[106:28.67]B. Done.
[106:31.40]Is Count Chocula... I don't need to say it.
[106:35.26]You know the rule.
[106:35.86]Okay.
[106:51.59]Is Call of Duty better than Lucky Charms?
[106:52.96]Yes.
[106:53.26]Is Lucky Charms better than Honey Bunch of O's?
[106:54.66]No.
[106:55.94]Is Lucky Charms better than Lucky Charms?
[106:57.12]Yes.
[106:58.04]Okay.
[107:00.28]It was the branding.
[107:01.02]The branding fucked with me.
[107:03.81]It's the branding.
[107:04.39]It's the same brand.
[107:05.09]It's the same thing.
[107:05.77]This is a knockoff of each other.
[107:10.03]You could have a lawsuit.
[107:11.88]One of them could sue the other one.
[107:19.72]They've got the same opening mouth.
[107:21.30]They've got the same, like, zoom in.
[107:24.06]They've got the same, like, somebody could get sued.
[107:31.69]There's the same branding box that fucked up my brain.
[108:01.23]I've been on this single list for an hour.
[108:02.63]It's very important.
[108:03.39]This is an incredibly important list.
[108:07.51]Why are Rice Krispies SS tier?
[108:09.46]That is Rice Krispies Treats cereal.
[108:11.98]That's not just regular Rice Krispies.
[108:15.58]Regular Rice Krispies is down here.
[108:18.68]That's a Rice Krispies Treats cereal.
[108:27.21]Okay.
[108:28.49]I think I'm happy with this.
[108:37.75]I think.
[108:38.13]Yeah.
[108:40.43]Now it's Crave.
[108:42.35]No.
[108:42.79]Chips Ahoy.
[108:44.99]It's just Cookie Crisp.
[108:46.89]But with an exclamation point on it.
[108:52.52]Honeycomb is good.
[108:53.68]Fruit Loops.
[108:54.20]No.
[108:54.54]Get them down here.
[108:56.22]Golden Crisp is probably better than these.
[108:59.62]Apple Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
[109:00.64]I don't like those.
[109:02.44]But I wouldn't put them down here.
[109:06.49]Maybe I would.
[109:19.52]I think I would.
[109:23.66]I don't eat these.
[109:24.32]Like, I don't know why I'm putting them up here.
[109:30.69]Alright, one step at a time here.
[109:31.79]Alright, so we got...
[109:41.78]Another thing that I just figured out right here.
[109:43.84]Count Chocula is just a much better version of Lucky Charms.
[109:48.28]It's just... It's like this... It's like the... It's like the yin and the yang of cereals.
[109:54.67]I like this one better.
[109:55.67]What are you talking about?
[110:05.79]Count Chocula is like little fucking...
[110:10.73]pieces with marshmallows.
[110:13.81]This is Little Pieces with Marshmallows.
[110:16.07]They're the original Little Pieces with Marshmallows cereal.
[110:26.82]Count Chocula had the, the, the crispy little, like, bready pieces and the marshmallows.
[110:33.58]Lucky Charms had the crispy little bready pieces and the marshmallows.
[110:36.24]What other cereal had that?
[110:41.82]What other cereal had the marshmallows with the crispy puffs?
[110:48.56]Those are the two originals.
[110:54.34]One of them's chocolate.
[110:55.89]Yeah, that's why I said it's like the opposite, but they're like the same like cereal, but one is opposite of the other.
[111:02.83]It's like a mirror.
[111:08.67]These are the original fucking characters.
[111:13.19]Yeah, they've got like... They add marshmallows to every cereal now.
[111:18.89]Oh, fruity pebbles with marshmallows.
[111:21.85]Frosted flakes with marshmallows.
[111:24.15]This is the original too.
[111:28.35]Sorry, guys.
[111:29.71]That's the way it is.
[111:32.79]I like this one better.
[111:36.85]Donut steel?
[111:37.89]What's donut steel?
[111:45.84]Imagine thinking Kix is a B, but Fruity Pebbles is a D. It's the soggiest fucking cereal in the world!
[112:03.09]I wanted to do a third-party test to see what the soggiest damn cereal is.
[112:07.91]It's gonna be Fruity Pebbles.
[112:14.57]I like my cereal soggy.
[112:24.02]It's... Is this your tier list?
[112:28.10]Whose tier list is this?
[112:32.12]I like it like this.
[112:33.00]Okay.
[112:34.74]Whose list is this?
[112:36.98]It's my list.
[112:39.14]It's not your list.
[112:40.52]Go make your list.
[112:41.60]I would love to see it.
[112:45.13]This is my cereal list.
[112:47.77]I don't like my cereal soggy, therefore Fruity Pebbles is down here.
[112:50.37]What's going on here?
[112:56.61]Whose list is this?
[113:07.14]Getting me heated over fucking sugar in a box.
[113:16.91]It's all dog shit anyways.
[113:19.25]From A to B, from S to D, these are all, you know, eat a banana.
[113:24.53]Eat a fucking fruit.
[113:25.63]Have a salad for breakfast.
[113:27.15]Don't eat these.
[113:28.11]Don't eat Cocoa Puffs for breakfast.
[113:29.76]What the fuck?
[113:30.26]Why would you do that?
[113:33.54]Eat an apple.
[113:34.82]Eat a pear.
[113:36.70]They're all like the same tier, just stretched out a little.
[113:42.08]See these?
[113:42.96]These aren't even on here.
[113:44.40]Because I'm a degenerate fuck that doesn't eat the good ones.
[113:47.82]This is like just an accordion of bad cereals.
[113:57.47]And that's why the Captain Crunch is the best.
[114:05.47]Cut his mic.
[114:07.79]I've got blueberries on this list.
[114:09.97]Okay?
[114:10.95]If you want to criticize something, criticize the fact that I don't eat like whole grain cereals.
[114:17.62]All these good, nice whole grain oat cereals are down at the fucking bottom.
[114:23.26]I've never had them.
[114:24.17]But I've eaten the fucking Captain Crunch entourage like a thousand times.
[114:32.39]Somebody just gave subs.
[114:33.91]Thank you, modest narcissist.
[114:36.97]For the five community subs.
[114:43.62]Like, brand flakes?
[114:47.78]You should be more concerned.
[114:50.14]Like, I am between the ages of 8 and 13 cereals.
[114:57.29]That should be more concerning.
[115:01.55]Actually, well, honey nut Cheerios.
[115:05.34]And regular Cheerios, if I was a responsible functioning adult, would be up here.
[115:14.68]But no, it's down here.
[115:25.65]Anyways, I'm going to go on with my cereal list.
[115:33.04]That just made me think about my health a little bit, so these are going to get bumped up a little.
[115:39.73]That made me concerned about my list.
[115:43.69]Just wanted to move them up just a little bit because I'm a little concerned about my health now.
[115:48.73]Like Crunch Berry, Captain Crunch, it makes up at least every top tier at least once.
[115:54.75]I probably should bump up the Multigrain Cheerios a little.
[116:02.80]Yeah, pops are on here.
[116:04.28]Come on.
[116:06.62]Putting higher cereals up on your list is not going to improve your health.
[116:13.00]Alright.
[116:13.78]Now that we've cleared that up, we've gotten that out of the way, let's continue.
[116:24.21]Put these on the order list because I don't want them.
[116:28.03]Oreo owes it B is a travesty.
[116:37.96]I'm drinking coffee at 10 o'clock at night.
[116:52.91]Health.
[116:57.49]Okay.
[116:58.99]Alright.
[117:00.51]I know you love some of these cereals.
[117:02.53]I do too.
[117:04.76]And for that reason.
[117:08.58]I'm just, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[117:13.51]D tier.
[117:17.43]No, Lucky Charms really is not that good.
[117:20.53]Multigrain Cheerios and Corn Flakes are definitely not better than Raisin Bran.
[117:30.67]Corn Flakes actually should be somewhere down here.
[117:33.83]Crave should be down here, I think.
[117:43.41]This is the new recipe.
[117:44.21]I don't like it.
[117:49.97]Alright.
[117:51.47]I'm happy with this.
[117:54.08]Now I am.
[117:56.84]Now I am.
[117:58.44]Now I'm... No, now I'm happy with this.
[118:01.96]Now I am.
[118:05.73]Yeah, I think so.
[118:06.49]Okay.
[118:08.27]This is the D list.
[118:09.09]This is cereals that I still think are alright.
[118:12.51]But I don't really buy because they're too much of a pain in the ass to eat.
[118:16.74]Or they're too bland for me.
[118:55.66]Guys, I gotta say something here, real important.
[119:00.93]I put Fruity Pebbles down on the D list.
[119:08.00]I didn't scream in your mother's face.
[119:25.60]the same.
[119:26.20]That's it.
[119:29.52]I'm finishing my list.
[119:33.51]Wheaties.
[119:34.17]They're fine.
[119:36.53]Coconut Fruity Pebbles.
[119:37.89]I don't want them.
[119:38.89]I don't want these.
[119:40.01]What are they?
[119:41.43]Oh.
[119:44.65]The Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
[119:47.31]They can stay where they are.
[119:49.14]Golden Grahams.
[119:49.84]Probably a little bit better.
[119:50.92]Golden Grahams are probably better than all these.
[119:54.50]You know what?
[119:56.31]Golden Grahams is definitely better than all of these two.
[120:01.09]I jumped that too quick.
[120:03.96]Golden Grahams is really, really good.
[120:06.82]The only issue I have is they get soggy in 10 seconds.
[120:10.04]But the 10 seconds that you get to eat them, they're good.
[120:13.88]It belongs up here.
[120:17.11]Why is Cheerios a D?
[120:22.31]Oh, no, it belongs there.
[120:24.13]That's like D- though.
[120:26.40]I would probably rather eat Cheerios.
[120:28.42]Yeah, I'd rather eat Cheerios than Frosted Cheerios.
[120:31.82]I'm a health-conscious guy.
[120:47.41]Notice how... Are you noticing a pattern?
[120:50.72]I just don't really like Cheerios.
[120:54.48]Really that much at all.
[120:57.72]Rice Krispies are probably better than these two meme cereals.
[121:13.49]It's weird because I've probably eaten these two cereals less than the amount of times I've seen it on Adult Swim.
[121:23.20]So there's a reason why it's down here.
[121:28.85]Apple Jacks is A tier.
[121:38.68]For you, maybe.
[121:42.46]But, hmm.
[121:59.61]Foot Captain Crunch in the trash tier.
[122:05.43]Where's the Mario cereal?
[122:06.27]The Mario cereal wasn't on here.
[122:14.59]If you watch the commercial for Apple Jacks, it'll be S tier.
[122:23.28]I think that's the list.
[122:24.46]I think that's it.
[122:28.05]These, this is a pretty, look, look at the first three rows.
[122:32.12]Here's the thing.
[122:33.26]Everybody's first two or three rows are going to be kind of similar.
[122:36.86]Everybody, every other cereal in like B to D is super personal opinion.
[122:42.14]It's all just personal opinion, right?
[122:45.19]Everybody fucking knows.
[122:46.73]Everybody on Earth knows that Cinnamon Toast Crunch is a great cereal.
[122:49.95]Raisin Bran Crunch is a great cereal.
[122:51.77]Pops, Smacks, Crunch Berries, Frost Flakes, these are all A. Everybody knows that.
[122:55.73]Everybody knows that.
[122:58.31]This down here is where you get to, like, personal opinion.
[123:04.01]Pops is a... How could you not... Pops... Pops is one of the most unique cereals.
[123:09.35]It's... Honey Smacks and Pops are not just toasted fucking corn with marshmallows in it.
[123:16.80]It's not just, like, a circle that tastes like bread.
[123:20.00]Honey Smacks tastes wildly different than anything else.
[123:22.68]Pops tastes really wildly different than anything else.
[123:26.65]Captain Crunch tastes wildly different than anything.
[123:29.09]Let me tell you what cereals taste exactly the same, okay?
[123:31.46]You ready for me to blow up this whole scenario here?
[123:34.72]These are the cereals that taste exact, identical to each other.
[123:37.18]Ready?
[123:40.40]These.
[123:41.48]One, two.
[123:49.51]These two.
[123:49.95]You know, the idea is that they all taste, they all taste pretty similar.
[123:53.37]Except for like three of them.
[123:56.76]These two.
[123:57.90]These two.
[123:59.42]These three.
[124:01.44]These, like, four.
[124:03.00]All the Cheerios.
[124:03.76]They have different, like, fucking seasoning packets on them.
[124:06.10]It's still Cheerios.
[124:06.90]They still taste the same.
[124:08.50]This is just a mirror.
[124:10.80]Look, they taste different.
[124:11.68]That's all you need to know.
[124:14.36]Crave is too low.
[124:15.32]Alright.
[124:15.56]You know, somebody said Crave is too low.
[124:17.44]It's going up here.
[124:23.94]Honey Smacks tastes different than anything else.
[124:28.85]Do a cigarette tier list.
[124:47.62]I have marbles.
[124:49.96]They all belong in the trash.
[124:51.12]Can I put them all down here?
[124:54.14]Alright, please.
[124:55.00]Can we just agree?
[124:56.38]Can we agree on something?
[124:58.41]This is... Guys, this is a serialist.
[125:00.55]This is like British Parliament right now.
[125:03.28]Can we all agree on one thing?
[125:05.58]Sour Patch Kids cereal should be removed from shelves.
[125:11.34]Like, we... Come on.
[125:12.68]Like, why would it be there?
[125:14.18]That's like, why?
[125:17.39]And Peeps... No.
[125:21.23]And these are just not very good.
[125:22.79]But Sour Patch Kids... We can all agree on that.
[125:36.93]I'm good.
[125:39.51]I got my list.
[125:40.13]I'm happy with it.
[125:43.53]I think it's good for me.
[125:45.23]Those are my favorite cereals.
[125:48.44]In the comment section below, write out your favorite cereals.
[125:56.56]What is this?
[125:56.96]Annoying orange characters.
[125:58.38]I'm not doing that one.
[126:04.50]Pasta rankings?
[126:15.05]Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavors.
[126:16.59]I don't think I've had enough of them to be able to give an opinion.
[126:21.29]Fruit tier list.
[126:23.15]Alright, do you got a fruit?
[126:23.89]I'll give you the fruit tier list.
[126:24.85]I will.
[126:25.57]What is it?
[126:30.23]Is there actually a nice good fruit tier list?
[126:33.15]I'll do it.
[126:33.73]I'm going to do it quick.
[126:36.09]Jelly belly flavors.
[126:37.23]Don't even need the list.
[126:38.55]Every single one F, toasted marshmallow S. Pick them all out and just give them to somebody else for a present.
[126:46.00]Here's the tactic.
[126:47.38]Take out all the toasted marshmallow ones, eat them, reseal it, and give it to somebody for a present.
[126:53.38]Alright, fruit tier list.
[127:00.16]I'm getting linked to a lot of these.
[127:01.22]Give me the one with the most amount of options.
[127:11.71]Okay, let's link that.
[127:13.74]Alright, this is apparently fruit.
[127:14.90]Get a screenshot of that.
[127:16.48]Oh, no, get a screenshot of this because I need to know what I'm going to get tomorrow.
[127:21.62]Especially this part.
[127:23.14]The list is too big.
[127:25.29]So now that you got that screenshot, thank you.
[127:27.35]Here's the actual list.
[127:28.03]There you go.
[127:32.07]Okay, this is fruits coming up.
[127:39.48]okay this one shouldn't be too hard these are only mainstream fruits I didn't I wasn't aware that they were underground like indie dev fruits
[128:07.22]Sorry, we're only doing triple A fruits today.
[128:12.00]Okay.
[128:13.89]I am a citrus kind of guy.
[128:22.97]People are going to get so mad about this stuff.
[128:27.73]I'm just like opening up all avenues of attack is what I'm doing.
[128:38.47]Hold on a minute.
[128:38.99]This is important.
[128:41.53]Is this eating the fruit?
[128:44.09]Or is this the flavor of the fruit?
[128:46.97]Is it eating the fruit?
[128:52.97]Because some fruits taste alright, but they're gross to me.
[128:58.03]Eating it.
[128:58.45]Okay, fuck.
[128:58.97]Because I love oranges.
[129:00.77]I love orange juice.
[129:03.04]I don't like eating an orange.
[129:04.10]I think they're disgusting, eating them.
[129:06.19]You get like orange gristle.
[129:08.07]I hate oranges.
[129:08.81]I hate eating oranges.
[129:11.20]The white like gristle.
[129:13.84]Mm-mm.
[129:15.92]That's gonna change everything.
[129:23.65]I'm gonna go with flavor.
[129:25.69]Like the way that it tastes.
[129:34.53]I don't what's this one is that a tomato what is that I don't know what that fruit is there's a pumpkin there's no that's not a pumpkin
[130:05.02]lemons lemons are the best fruits lemon is fucking unbelievable guess what so is no I'm changing that pineapple is my favorite fruit lemon is my favorite like fruit flavor lemon and water a squeeze of lemon lemon flavoring that that like tart sour citrusy lemon flavor is my favorite flavor besides pineapple
[130:35.21]I am a... I am a kind of fruit guy.
[130:44.68]It's got to be citrusy and refreshing.
[130:50.30]I'm going to make a lot of people mad with a couple of these.
[130:53.88]Disgusting.
[130:55.18]Absolutely fucking revolting.
[130:57.28]Not because these... How many times... Eating berries.
[131:04.09]You, it's like eating sand.
[131:06.45]You crunch on this like, like a fucking hard sand.
[131:11.50]Try and blend them up.
[131:12.26]It doesn't work.
[131:13.16]You're drinking sand.
[131:13.96]You're eating sand.
[131:15.34]Those seeds in berries are the most obnoxious things.
[131:18.61]It's like eating fucking popcorn kernels.
[131:26.57]You said flavor.
[131:27.23]I did say flavor.
[131:28.37]But sometimes, you gotta think about the horrible experiences you've had.
[131:32.32]I've had a horrible experience eating blackberries before.
[131:34.54]Right?
[131:34.80]Or raspberries.
[131:35.38]What are these?
[131:37.08]Yeah.
[131:37.44]I've had a horrible experience eating these.
[131:47.19]Flavor-wise, they're good.
[131:48.55]But... I can't... I'm gonna leave them there for now.
[131:52.83]Cherries.
[131:55.21]Cherries.
[131:58.99]Bananas.
[132:01.33]Bananas in smoothies are amazing.
[132:02.77]Bananas are great.
[132:04.95]I love letting bananas rot, almost to the point where they're rotting, and then eat them.
[132:10.05]Some of you people will know what I'm talking about.
[132:12.01]Some of you guys here will know.
[132:14.21]Right before the banana starts to get really, really kind of ripe, overripe, is when I like to eat them the most.
[132:34.36]And by the way, where's your mother?
[132:35.60]Because I'm going to scream in her face.
[132:39.59]What are these?
[132:42.43]Watermelon.
[132:43.53]Ew, ew, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross.
[132:49.85]Worst.
[132:50.63]How do I have... No, where's the worst?
[132:51.84]I'm going to make a disgusting tear.
[132:54.34]I have to make awful tear.
[132:55.98]Add a row below.
[132:58.60]No, no, no, no, no.
[132:59.70]Disgust.
[133:00.18]Awful, awful, awful.
[133:00.90]Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.
[133:03.14]F. F.
[133:05.24]Grapefruits taste like stomach acid.
[133:16.12]know how so my mother used to eat these my mother would cut a grapefruit in half and she would put a little uh spork with you know the spoon that has little little uh ridges on top and she would eat it half a grapefruit and it's like oh okay you're gonna eat half a grapefruit but every time before she went in with it you know went in with the spoon she would cover the top of the half with sugar
[133:43.05]And apparently that was like the way to make it taste like worth eating out of the half.
[133:49.88]If you have to add sugar to fruit, I don't think it's worth eating.
[133:58.76]You have to add something on top.
[134:00.86]Well, it would only taste good if I put a fucking bunch of salt on it.
[134:04.70]No.
[134:05.30]Grapefruit juice is also disgusting.
[134:12.03]I'm sorry.
[134:12.49]I'm upsetting a lot of people.
[134:15.09]But that's the way it is.
[134:20.67]Where's kiwi?
[134:22.51]Done.
[134:24.69]What is this, corn?
[134:26.17]What is that?
[134:27.91]Lime?
[134:29.37]Weirdly enough, lime not as good as lemon to me.
[134:35.49]Belongs up there.
[134:37.90]What is that, coconut?
[134:38.38]Coconut?
[134:42.19]actually I hate coconut I love coconut juice I like coconut milk coconut water but coconut I don't really like coconut eating it it's gonna be what the is this is it ice cream is that oreo is that cookies and cream ice cream
[135:11.14]I've never eaten that.
[135:15.54]Grapes.
[135:17.82]Grapes can be up here as long as they're frozen.
[135:21.57]I don't like eating regular grapes.
[135:24.45]If they're frozen, I like them.
[135:25.51]But the reason why I don't like eating grapes is because my brother told me a story one time about how watch out when you eat grapes because there could be spiders in them.
[135:35.78]And that just freaked me out enough to put them down to be.
[135:41.99]But frozen grapes I think are amazing.
[135:51.06]Strawberry.
[135:55.18]Eh.
[135:58.60]Are you ready to have everybody hate me?
[136:02.95]I'm going to get off camera for this one.
[136:25.47]Apples suck.
[136:28.09]There's only one apple that I actually will eat.
[136:30.31]Willingly.
[136:31.83]And that's a Macintosh apple.
[136:38.53]Soft.
[136:39.71]Flesh.
[136:40.61]Apples.
[136:49.24]I heard something over there.
[136:50.00]What was that?
[136:54.57]It has to be crispy.
[136:56.73]I don't, look, I don't like apple pie.
[137:00.87]I don't like apple fritters.
[137:04.11]I don't like apple jacks.
[137:05.55]I don't like cinnamon apple cereals.
[137:07.21]I don't like apple.
[137:10.42]I don't like apple pie.
[137:12.31]I don't like anything with cooked apples in it.
[137:15.51]Because every time I eat something with cooked apples, if it's apple pie, ooh, whoa, oozy, yummy, hot apple pie.
[137:22.41]I love that filling until you get the piece of the apple, and it's like an old person sucking up a fucking prune.
[137:28.99]It's like a slippery slug, a hot slug that you... No, disgusting.
[137:34.57]I don't like that.
[137:38.78]I don't like it.
[137:40.34]I'm sorry.
[137:41.04]I'll eat Macintosh apples.
[137:45.71]I like blueberry iced coffee.
[137:47.11]Blueberries are right here.
[137:47.91]I just put it at A. Hot apples taste like a warm slug.
[137:58.04]I don't want to eat... I don't want to do that.
[138:03.07]I would eat a Macintosh apple right now if you brought it in here.
[138:06.11]I'd be like, okay, this is great.
[138:07.95]I like this.
[138:09.33]I like being able to like, and it's juicy and it flows down your face.
[138:20.40]I will say that green apples are better than like red apples.
[138:34.28]Melon, listen, melon is the fruit that you dig around in the fruit cup to eat the fruit that you want to eat.
[138:46.55]Once you run out of the good ones, you go, oh, well, I guess there's melon in here.
[138:59.54]I just saw it for the first time tonight.
[139:01.26]I saw Go to Hell.
[139:03.74]Go to hell.
[139:07.58]What is this?
[139:13.16]Oh, is this a Clementine?
[139:17.62]Tangerine.
[139:27.86]Alright, this is important.
[139:32.30]Nectarine.
[139:34.35]Ooh.
[139:36.53]This is Peach.
[139:37.39]This one's Nectarine, right?
[139:39.21]Nectarine belongs up here.
[139:48.23]Peach is really close behind.
[139:55.35]In fact, Nectarine may have to take the spot of Watermelon.
[139:57.87]Nectarines are incredible.
[140:02.85]Remember I told you, like, the Macintosh apple, when you bite into it, it's like that... If you get a ripe nectarine, the thing, it's as if somebody fucking just, like, sprayed a hose in your face.
[140:16.38]It's like... It's incredible.
[140:21.52]Okay, nectarines are what gushes the fruit snack we're trying to emulate very poorly, very badly.
[140:30.83]You get that, like, super soft bite with that flow of, like, fruit juice down into your mouth.
[140:36.87]Oh, my God.
[140:37.75]I'm good.
[140:38.37]Where's the list that I can put this on and get these tomorrow at the grocery store?
[140:46.60]Peaches are gross?
[140:47.38]Peaches are not.
[140:47.92]I don't think peaches are good as nectarines.
[140:49.84]I still think they're good, though.
[140:52.02]Sometimes I pretend to be, like, a bee when I eat them, too.
[140:54.18]Like, this is what, like, a bee did this.
[140:57.24]And I'm, like, eating, like, nature.
[140:58.04]Bee.
[140:58.18]Bee.
[141:02.50]Like, I'm a bee.
[141:03.38]Like a nectar.
[141:07.66]Pears?
[141:08.76]It depends on what kind of pear, but I usually like pears.
[141:11.32]Pears are better than apples.
[141:14.82]I don't know if I... Yeah, pears... No, I probably eat blueberries over pears.
[141:20.76]The rest of these, I don't know what these are.
[141:25.43]This is other orange.
[141:28.65]This is...
[141:31.32]I don't know what that is.
[141:31.90]What is this one?
[141:33.34]Is it papaya?
[141:36.50]This is a mango?
[141:37.14]Which one's a mango?
[141:41.55]What's the corn one?
[141:46.12]It's a permission.
[141:47.26]Permission, permission.
[141:48.46]What is it?
[141:58.49]I don't really... I'm not, like, into it.
[142:03.57]Mango and papaya.
[142:04.31]Which one of these is which?
[142:06.87]I like mango salsa.
[142:09.20]I don't eat mangoes, though.
[142:10.32]A little too slimy for me.
[142:12.58]A little too slippery and slimy.
[142:14.62]When you, like, cut into... You have, like, mango slices.
[142:17.48]It's, like, covered in ice.
[142:18.80]You, like, pick it up.
[142:19.42]It just slips out of you.
[142:20.14]It's too slimy and slippery.
[142:25.19]I do like... I do like... I need some more down at sea.
[142:33.77]Okay, let's do it.
[142:35.96]Best fruit on Earth is a pineapple.
[142:40.72]Fresh cored pineapple that is ripe.
[142:47.14]It cannot be compared to anything.
[142:48.99]Anything.
[142:49.63]Anything.
[142:51.56]It's every single thing you want in a fruit.
[142:53.94]It's really good for you.
[142:55.80]It's really fucking delicious.
[142:57.62]It's got an incredibly distinct flavor.
[143:00.50]And it has an enzyme in it that eats your fucking flesh from the inside out.
[143:05.10]Fucking sick.
[143:06.05]That's like cool.
[143:06.91]Badass, right?
[143:13.67]Kiwis, on the other hand, are lighter.
[143:15.89]I could eat like five of these and be like, oh, that was pretty good.
[143:19.61]Cut them up into little tiny thin slices.
[143:21.83]I'm talking like deli thin.
[143:24.11]Lay them out.
[143:25.63]And just pick them up and eat them like little cucumbers.
[143:29.29]They're great.
[143:31.43]You can eat the skin.
[143:32.81]Too fuzzy.
[143:34.11]Too fuzzy for me.
[143:36.04]But I do love kiwis.
[143:40.48]So I think that's good for me.
[143:42.70]Two of the best fruits.
[143:45.05]Lemons is just top tier flavor for me.
[143:49.13]I would put nectarine in front of it, but I'm not going to because I drink lemon water all the time.
[143:55.46]If I drink a glass of water, I usually have a little lemon squeezer and I just squeeze like a half a lemon in the water and drink it sometimes.
[144:04.08]Maybe like once in a while.
[144:06.50]I just like the taste.
[144:07.50]I like the way it makes me feel.
[144:11.86]Where do plums go?
[144:14.33]Plums are down here.
[144:17.15]But they might not be there forever.
[144:18.55]This is just a preliminary.
[144:20.21]I had to do it.
[144:23.17]So, yeah, watermelons, as you can tell by this list, I'm really into those fruits that are really easy to bite into.
[144:32.21]So you bite into them and your teeth just kind of melt right through.
[144:34.93]It's like having meat off the bone, like a smoked brisket.
[144:37.17]These two are the smoked brisket.
[144:44.13]of the fruit world it's tender your teeth go right through it and it's just juicy and delicious yes that's why they're up here peach is pretty close but I like nectarine flavor better than peach we already described that this is tangerines I would probably put tangerines down this way more closer this is orange tangerine is already down there um
[145:12.94]like orange probably more than banana but I like blueberry more than I like banana and I like banana more than like pear strawberry and lime this is where you get into I I like it I would I don't I would eat it every day I would I would eat any of these pretty much any day cherries too much work you know what I mean
[145:37.17]Like, too much work.
[145:37.85]You gotta eat it.
[145:39.01]You, like, spin the... You don't... Don't swallow the fucking seed.
[145:43.01]There's a giant, like, core in the middle.
[145:45.51]And you gotta, like... Like, work around it and then... Like, spit it out.
[145:48.67]What do you do with it?
[145:49.27]Spit it out in your hand?
[145:51.29]Too much work.
[145:54.33]And I'm not, like, a big cherry flavor kind of person.
[145:59.43]Just pull it out?
[146:00.61]Yeah, on your date?
[146:02.85]Oh, so what is it that you do for work again?
[146:04.53]Mmm.
[146:05.29]Mmm.
[146:09.84]I'm a scientist.
[146:10.62]I work for NASA.
[146:13.18]What?
[146:13.50]No.
[146:16.00]Come on.
[146:18.85]What is this one again?
[146:19.85]I don't remember.
[146:20.33]That's why it's down here.
[146:20.97]Is it mango?
[146:21.75]Papaya?
[146:23.77]Decent flavor.
[146:24.51]I like the flavorings better than these.
[146:30.65]Look, C does not mean bad.
[146:31.97]C does not mean bad.
[146:38.42]sea is fine see I would I would I just I don't look I like cherry coke and I like uh grenadine syrup but that's tear that's not real now here we go raspberries are definitely
[147:01.80]I really don't even know what the cookies and cream thing even tastes like, so I can't even really put it on the list, but it's not F because I don't really know.
[147:13.82]I definitely would rather eat all of these before I would eat an apple.
[147:21.34]Like, you gave me a choice.
[147:22.24]You said, hey, here's a bunch of raspberries or apples.
[147:26.61]Eat one.
[147:27.55]I would just be like, oh, raspberry.
[147:28.55]I'll take one.
[147:35.37]I avoid these at all costs.
[147:40.13]In fact, that's how it should look.
[147:49.68]Done.
[147:54.60]Done.
[147:57.28]I think that's pretty accurate to me.
[148:00.25]Where's the pomegranate?
[148:00.99]It's not on this list.
[148:02.48]Although pomegranate would be somewhere in front of cherry because I feel like they're like... Plus, pomegranate, the inside of it looks fucking weird.
[148:11.38]It's weird.
[148:12.24]It's like a bunch of strange scattered egg sacs inside with seeds in it.
[148:16.55]Like spiders.
[148:17.55]There's spiders in there.
[148:18.61]Those could be spider eggs.
[148:20.17]That's all I know.
[148:20.65]My brother told me that one time.
[148:21.95]So that's why I can't eat it.
[148:23.85]Okay, so... There it is.
[148:29.32]Any more brain busters?
[148:31.02]Cheeses?
[148:31.94]I'll do cheeses.
[148:33.68]How long is this stream?
[148:35.62]We're still going, we're fine.
[148:40.35]Have I eaten enough cheeses for this to work?
[148:47.43]I'm not going to do annoying orange characters.
[148:50.71]They're all annoying.
[148:53.32]Is there just one bar that just is annoying on it?
[148:57.86]Do soda.
[148:58.48]I could all do soda.
[148:59.49]Give me a good soda one.
[149:04.13]Chips.
[149:04.37]We'll do soda.
[149:08.65]Can we get a soda one?
[149:09.45]A good soda?
[149:10.45]I'm talking a good soda one.
[149:15.76]Let's check this one out.
[149:18.90]Soda.
[149:19.30]That was fruits.
[149:19.92]Here comes soda.
[149:27.32]Oh, this is a lot.
[149:31.70]Okay.
[149:32.60]I do appreciate they have it all set up already.
[149:34.44]The trash and I don't care, haven't had it, don't care.
[149:39.79]Let's go.
[149:41.81]This is, I don't think I've had that, but I love 7-Up.
[149:44.65]7-Up, I think, is better than Sprite.
[149:48.09]By a pretty decent margin, I think.
[149:51.40]Dr. Pepper has fallen off for me in recent years.
[149:59.29]A&W root beer is the best root beer.
[150:02.71]Cream soda, I used to love it, but I think it's disgusting now.
[150:07.81]When I was 15, 16, 17 years old, I was obsessed with this stuff.
[150:13.25]But now it almost just tastes like... It just tastes like... Like they got halfway through and they stopped making the soda.
[150:22.40]They added the water...
[150:23.89]The carbonation and a bunch of sugar, caramely kind of sugar flavor.
[150:27.43]And then they didn't, they stopped.
[150:28.79]Like there needs to be something else.
[150:29.89]It's weird.
[150:30.91]It's like, it's not, doesn't do it for me anymore.
[150:35.49]Barks root beer.
[150:37.17]Uh, I don't know if it's better than A&W, but it's still alright.
[150:40.84]I would drink it.
[150:41.76]Barks is good.
[150:44.48]Is this a water?
[150:47.78]What is that?
[150:48.16]This is just water.
[150:59.19]If it's water, then I'm just going to pretend this is water.
[151:04.07]It belongs up here.
[151:09.32]I haven't had... I don't know what that is.
[151:12.06]There's no way you could never in your whole life have never tried water.
[151:16.52]You getting water accidentally in your mouth in the shower counts.
[151:22.97]There's no way anyone's never had water.
[151:25.84]You'd be dead.
[151:26.46]You would just die.
[151:27.76]You would just turn into bones.
[151:29.60]It'd be dead.
[151:32.54]I don't really know what that is, so it's off the list.
[151:34.34]Is this iced tea?
[151:34.92]I wish there was like a zoom in button.
[151:38.92]What is this?
[151:39.64]Is this like, is this iced tea?
[151:44.83]This is not breast milk.
[151:55.23]What does it say?
[152:01.92]It's called Balls?
[152:03.12]I don't know what this is.
[152:05.10]Balls.
[152:05.94]I don't know what this is either.
[152:08.96]Canada Drive.
[152:09.59]Ginger Rail goes up here.
[152:11.11]This is going to be a deliberation here.
[152:12.61]It's going to take me a while.
[152:15.89]Oh, fuck.
[152:18.23]Uh-oh.
[152:29.23]This is the real one right here.
[152:37.81]Where does Pepsi go?
[152:48.08]Coke's better than Pepsi.
[153:05.47]Sorry.
[153:07.01]Like 44% of you now think that I'm like talking to the devil every night before I go to bed.
[153:18.36]I now pray to the devil every night before I go to sleep.
[153:23.50]To half of you guys now.
[153:29.89]Is this like steak sauce?
[153:34.61]Dad's?
[153:36.53]Uh, no.
[153:37.17]Cherry Coke.
[153:38.09]Not as good as regular Coke.
[153:40.91]Um, this is like, what is this?
[153:42.07]Like espresso Coke?
[153:43.13]I don't think I've never had that.
[153:50.01]Get this shit out of here.
[153:51.84]Stop drinking this.
[153:54.04]Honest to God.
[153:55.78]Get the fuck out of here.
[153:59.90]Diet fucking coke.
[154:00.82]Diet Pepsi.
[154:01.71]Just, no.
[154:02.87]Get, don't, stop, don't, don't drink them anymore.
[154:10.99]No, A&W, uh, there's cream soaps better than this.
[154:14.79]Don't drink that anymore.
[154:17.19]Like, I'm looking out for your health.
[154:20.65]Any more diet sodas on this list?
[154:23.33]Do you see any?
[154:23.83]Because they're going in the trash.
[154:30.51]These are fucking awful too.
[154:35.57]The Minute Maid lemonade in the fucking jar.
[154:39.09]No, no, no.
[154:40.23]They're bad.
[154:41.57]No.
[154:45.45]These lemonades that come out of the bottle...
[154:49.50]Are so over-sweetened.
[154:51.98]It tastes like syrup.
[154:53.22]It's like lemon syrup.
[154:54.58]It's not even like fucking... It's not even like drinking like refreshing... Like... Quencher.
[154:59.37]It's syrup.
[155:01.81]You could cut this like three times.
[155:03.95]This is a lemonade concentrate.
[155:06.25]That's not lemonade.
[155:07.37]You can make four lemonades out of this.
[155:10.43]Tastes good.
[155:11.57]But... Just...
[155:13.47]Save some money.
[155:14.59]Buy one of those and then just cut it with water, like at least 40% of it.
[155:18.59]You'll be like, oh wow, that's not even that much of a difference.
[155:21.93]Trying to say, I'm looking out for you.
[155:24.51]But both of them, mm-mm.
[155:33.12]If this were younger teenage me, this would be up here.
[155:38.48]I am a sucker for Shirley Temples.
[155:43.00]Mountain Dew Code Red is as close to a bottled Shirley Temple as you can get.
[155:49.33]I love... If Shirley Temple was on here, I would put it up in the S tier.
[155:56.83]They're so good.
[155:57.73]But they're just so bad for you.
[155:59.93]But this probably truly belongs somewhere down here.
[156:08.04]Sprite.
[156:08.97]I actually prefer Sprite over any of the other Amber drinks at this point.
[156:16.99]Besides root beer.
[156:18.79]Like I said, Dr. Pepper has fallen off a little bit for me.
[156:26.25]These are meme sodas.
[156:27.01]I don't want them.
[156:33.76]Hmm.
[156:36.81]Is this the same thing?
[156:37.57]Is this vanilla Coke?
[156:38.75]Isn't this vanilla Coke too?
[156:40.53]They're both the same one, right?
[156:46.83]Is this one different?
[156:49.87]Wait, is this the orange Coke?
[156:52.30]Is this the orange one?
[156:53.38]If it's the orange one, it's going somewhere very specific.
[156:56.68]This is Coke orange?
[156:57.84]Confirmed?
[156:58.40]This is confirmed Coke orange?
[157:01.52]Confirmed Coke orange?
[157:03.48]It's awful.
[157:14.91]Pepsi's already up there.
[157:17.53]RC Cola may as well just be the same thing as all the other ones.
[157:22.67]But it's like the worst one at a mall, I guess.
[157:24.67]But it's cheaper, though, right?
[157:26.15]Maybe I would drink it.
[157:29.03]Mellow Yellow is Mountain Dew.
[157:31.49]And speaking of Mountain Dew, do you know where this is going?
[157:43.52]Into the trash.
[157:46.71]This other Mountain Dew.
[157:49.51]No.
[157:52.29]Crush Orange Soda.
[157:58.25]Somewhere up here.
[158:01.12]Sierra Mist.
[158:03.20]Somewhere up here.
[158:06.30]I don't know.
[158:06.62]What does this one say?
[158:07.26]What's this one?
[158:10.84]Chuck E. Cheese?
[158:12.12]Chuck E. Cheese Soda?
[158:13.45]Chuck E. Cheese Soda?
[158:17.98]Wait, this is Baja?
[158:19.34]This is Baja Blast?
[158:31.04]It's better.
[158:32.14]It's good.
[158:34.38]Zoom in?
[158:34.76]No, I'm trying to exercise my eyes.
[158:37.89]uh chocolate cheese soda I've never had it uh fanta fanta is just kind of orange crush but it's they're both essentially identical there's no differences I think one of them is a little more syrupy I think fanta is a little a little syrupy for me so I'll probably put it down I don't know I don't think I really want it I'd rather get a crush
[158:57.58]I really don't like a grape soda.
[158:59.74]If I'm going to get a crush, it's going to be the orange variant, not the grape one.
[159:02.74]So I'm not a big fan of orange grape soda.
[159:06.29]I don't know what this is.
[159:07.01]This looks like strawberry soda, but I've never had it.
[159:11.03]Jolt Cola.
[159:11.65]Don't drink it.
[159:12.25]Stop.
[159:12.87]Be fucking aware of it.
[159:13.87]Is this cigarette ashes in water?
[159:18.34]Oh, no.
[159:18.86]It's IBC root beer?
[159:25.70]Is this a cream soda?
[159:29.29]I haven't had this one before.
[159:32.17]IBC root beer, though, is... I don't know if it's better than, like... It's probably on the same level as Barks.
[159:37.99]And these should be down a little more.
[159:42.26]I think I would rather have, like, a vanilla Coke than, like, a root beer.
[159:46.72]Although... I would rather have... Now, wait a minute.
[159:51.30]This is very specific.
[159:52.18]It's not in the can.
[159:53.44]I would rather have the glass bottle IBC root beer than the can of Coke.
[160:00.60]I think so.
[160:02.64]Because that doesn't come in a can.
[160:06.21]Yeah, I would.
[160:08.63]Put normal vanilla in the trash.
[160:11.15]I like vanilla.
[160:12.43]What's wrong with vanilla Coke?
[160:13.89]I like it.
[160:14.23]It's good.
[160:15.55]I don't drink it all the time, but sometimes you're looking for it and you want it.
[160:23.29]Squirt has not been available, I don't think, for like 25 years.
[160:28.51]Surge is another meme soda.
[160:32.63]I've never had it.
[160:41.24]Why is this an eBay listing?
[160:44.08]That's the best picture you can find?
[160:47.82]Storm Soda.
[160:55.27]I've never had it.
[160:58.10]Mellow Yellow is, I think it's better than Mountain Dew.
[161:02.20]But not by very much, I don't think.
[161:03.72]Hold on.
[161:04.58]It's definitely better than this.
[161:06.93]It's the Star Wars flavor.
[161:11.61]The rest of these are kind of the same.
[161:15.35]Wait, but it's bottles.
[161:17.68]Ah, I get it.
[161:19.54]Yeah, alright.
[161:20.80]So I'd rather have a bottle of Coke than a can of Coke.
[161:25.24]Bottom tier for me is plastic bottles.
[161:30.40]Plastic bottle Coke, plastic bottle Pepsi is F tier.
[161:38.57]Can Coke, bottle Coke is better for me.
[161:43.31]Plastic bottle, no, I just, if I can, if I don't, I don't want it.
[161:52.41]It's going in the trash.
[161:53.97]I would never... I cannot think of any scenario, ever.
[161:58.05]And I mean actually.
[162:00.85]Ever.
[162:01.99]That I would buy a plastic bottle Pepsi.
[162:06.62]I wouldn't.
[162:10.76]I wouldn't do it.
[162:14.06]That has to go in the trash.
[162:15.30]I mean, Pepsi is obviously... I would drink Pepsi.
[162:19.13]I wouldn't like avoid Pepsi.
[162:20.45]That's fine.
[162:21.09]Whatever.
[162:22.61]But I'm not going to buy a plastic fucking bottle of Pepsi.
[162:25.91]Look at chat.
[162:26.41]What?
[162:30.75]You have vanilla Coke in the trash.
[162:31.97]The one next to Coke is regular caffeine free.
[162:34.10]I thought this was the orange one.
[162:43.40]What?
[162:44.96]You have vanilla in the trash.
[162:49.89]Orange isn't on here.
[162:50.55]Well, I'm just going to pretend that's what they are.
[162:53.99]No, in my brain, that's fine.
[162:55.93]This is vanilla Coke.
[162:57.19]This is orange Coke.
[162:58.07]It's in the trash.
[162:59.69]That's fine.
[163:00.67]We can use our own list.
[163:05.08]Here, look.
[163:05.92]This is vanilla, and just pretend that this is orange Coke.
[163:11.80]It's caffeine-free Coke.
[163:13.96]That's fine.
[163:14.40]I would put it in here anyways.
[163:16.82]Just, yeah, play pretend.
[163:20.82]Alright, hold on.
[163:23.38]I'm missing some stuff here.
[163:27.58]What is that?
[163:28.90]Oh, okay.
[163:30.24]Bottle of Coke versus a bottle of IBC root beer.
[163:32.50]Probably a bottle of Coke.
[163:33.85]Especially if it's, like, frosty.
[163:35.15]If there's, like, still, like, white frosty shit all over it.
[163:40.61]And, ah, yeah.
[163:42.87]Only if it has the white frosty shit all over it.
[163:45.35]Otherwise, I don't, it's not as good.
[163:48.82]While I'm holding that in my hand, it has to burn me.
[163:51.70]It has to be like, this is too fucking cold to even hold my hands.
[163:58.92]That's Mexican Coke.
[164:02.23]That's fine.
[164:05.87]Yeah, that's actually even better.
[164:12.85]Pib Extra.
[164:14.27]I don't care.
[164:17.77]Oh, this is ginger beer, right?
[164:20.15]This stuff is actually pretty good.
[164:21.41]This is pretty good.
[164:23.25]I will put this up here.
[164:25.93]That's good stuff.
[164:30.31]A&W gives me a stomachache.
[164:42.05]Is this a bottle of Pepsi?
[164:43.41]Or is this a special Pepsi?
[164:45.66]I think that's just a glass bottle of Pepsi.
[164:47.80]I would... No, I'd rather have these two.
[164:52.89]Crystal Pepsi is a funny laugh-out-loud ecto-cooler 90s kids thing.
[165:01.33]I don't care.
[165:06.77]This is... What is this?
[165:11.44]Oh, this is one of those Japanese sodas, right?
[165:17.59]This is the thing where you, like, you punch the thing down and it, like, like, the flavor goes in?
[165:25.57]It is, right?
[165:27.89]Okay.
[165:28.79]These are okay.
[165:29.73]These... I don't know if I... It's weird, though.
[165:36.26]You don't really ever have an opportunity to drink these.
[165:38.74]Like, why do you drink soda?
[165:40.60]Or liquid?
[165:42.46]Oh, I'm thirsty.
[165:43.38]I want to quench my thirst.
[165:46.11]this is more like a game than it is like drinking a soda it's more like oh look at how cool that looks not like I can't wait to drink a coke right now it's like yeah it's a fun that's but I would put baja blast in that same category I don't like go I don't drink baja blast
[166:09.83]But if you go to Taco Bell, it's like, ooh, the like teal green one.
[166:14.59]Yeah, I'll take that one.
[166:15.93]Ooh, yeah, this is fun.
[166:17.92]It's for fun.
[166:18.38]These are the ones for fun, and they belong up at sea.
[166:23.40]There's no other scenario where I get this.
[166:26.25]Plus, I don't think you even get them.
[166:32.78]Can of Pepsi?
[166:33.64]Isn't there... I mean, what's the... Made with real sugar?
[166:35.88]This is a joke.
[166:37.41]This is just like the look.
[166:38.75]Look at how healthy we are when we're not healthy at all.
[166:40.65]Doesn't matter.
[166:46.69]Made with real sugar this time.
[166:53.01]It's still a Pepsi.
[166:59.04]You know, it probably is better than the regular one.
[167:07.90]Okay, what is this one?
[167:08.74]Is this diet?
[167:11.09]That looks like diet to me and it's making me angry.
[167:13.45]So it's going down here.
[167:23.87]Now the rest of these, I've had Jones soda before.
[167:33.38]But I don't think I've had these enough to really have an opinion on it.
[167:38.16]Some of these.
[167:38.58]This one, this is pretty good.
[167:39.58]This is the orange one, right?
[167:41.36]There's like a lemon-lime.
[167:42.38]Yeah, these are okay.
[167:43.04]These are good.
[167:43.68]These aren't bad.
[167:45.06]I'm just trying to remember how much better they are than the other ones.
[167:51.10]I distinctly remember these being very good.
[167:53.68]Like, potentially, like, best.
[167:57.41]But I haven't had them enough times to be able to have... That's not in my memory.
[168:01.81]I know they're good.
[168:04.02]But I know exactly what a 7-Up tastes like.
[168:06.34]I can describe it to you.
[168:08.91]It's the only one that's going up there.
[168:13.59]7-Up is the best soda in the world.
[168:18.67]It is.
[168:22.28]This is really the only ginger ale on the list.
[168:25.88]Canada Dry is up there too.
[168:32.66]Those of you that disagree with this, that's okay.
[168:35.16]That's alright.
[168:35.64]But just, you gotta listen.
[168:37.66]The next time that you go on an airplane, please, if they have it, get a 7-Up with that airplane ice.
[168:45.53]It enhances the flavor by 45%.
[168:46.51]Airplane ice and 7-Up.
[168:52.97]Something about it.
[168:53.73]I don't know what it is.
[168:54.87]It's fucking really good.
[168:57.26]I don't know what's on that ice.
[168:58.72]It might be toilet water.
[168:59.86]It could be toilet water ice, but there's some combination of airplane toilet water ice and 7-Up that make it magical.
[169:09.78]It is by far the best soda I would drink.
[169:11.90]And it's not everywhere either.
[169:14.18]That's the thing.
[169:16.27]See, all these dickheads, these guys are everywhere.
[169:21.79]7-Up is not in every single store.
[169:26.33]You can get a Pepsi literally anywhere.
[169:29.17]You could get a Pepsi at the doctor's office if you really wanted to.
[169:33.09]A 7-Up is a treat.
[169:34.57]You see it in the cooler and you go, oh, fuck, they got 7-Up here.
[169:39.27]Give me, give me like 7 of them.
[169:40.71]And you like stuff it in your fucking arm and go to the checkout.
[169:44.97]We buy it at the grocery store.
[169:46.07]That's not fun.
[169:50.77]I can get 7-Up at my dentist office.
[169:55.58]There's a reason why 7-Up's hard to find.
[169:57.16]It's because it's just selling out.
[169:58.52]People are just buying so many of them.
[170:01.68]Because it's the best airplane soda.
[170:03.08]You know how many people fly on airplanes every day?
[170:06.04]Okay, somebody calculate how many people are flying on an airplane today.
[170:10.09]And how many of those people are drinking a 7-Up right now?
[170:12.83]It's got to be a lot.
[170:14.33]There are like 5,000 airplanes that are flying around right now.
[170:17.96]That's at least... How many passengers are on an airplane?
[170:20.10]Like a typical... Like an Airbus or a 747 or whatever.
[170:22.70]There's probably like 200 or 300 people on a plane?
[170:27.68]Something like that, 100 people, 200?
[170:29.26]So 200 times 5,000, that's 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, that's like, let's just say there's like 200, let's just say there's like 400,000 people flying around in a plane right now, and like 40% of that, you got like 20, there's like probably 190,000 people drinking a 7-Up right now on an airplane.
[170:45.87]Definitely.
[170:50.47]More than that.
[170:54.59]Where do they get those numbers?
[170:57.27]I'm just spitballing.
[171:00.16]This is an open spitball platform here.
[171:05.30]I don't got a guy over there with like four laptops and like two fucking Google searches open.
[171:13.61]Hey, how many people are on a plane today?
[171:15.83]No, it's just me.
[171:16.89]It's just me and you.
[171:19.09]And all these gross teeth rotting beverages.
[171:22.29]There's nobody else.
[171:31.90]It's just the two of us.
[171:34.14]Times a couple hundred or a thousand people.
[171:38.69]Water is the S tier?
[171:39.63]Yeah, but it's not listed on here.
[171:40.91]Alright.
[171:42.21]Let's go back.
[171:42.65]This is our... I remember these are really, really good, but I can't put them above anything else.
[171:46.95]I don't think I've ever had these.
[171:48.51]I've never had sausage soda before, I don't think.
[171:52.26]Alright.
[171:53.56]No.
[171:54.14]Wait.
[171:56.52]Make sure I look good.
[171:57.44]Okay.
[171:58.48]Okay.
[172:00.31]7UP I think is the best on this list.
[172:02.02]KanoDryA and W, both A tier.
[172:04.31]Might have to move...
[172:33.81]Not as good.
[172:41.12]Close.
[173:01.72]Too sugary, I think, to me.
[173:03.58]I just tried it.
[173:04.66]I just tried it in my internal mind.
[173:06.54]And I think it was too sugary.
[173:11.54]These are all very sugary.
[173:13.00]Very, very sweet.
[173:20.83]Um... I think this is good.
[173:25.87]I don't think I need to change anything.
[173:27.11]Although... Let me put all the diet ones at the very bottom.
[173:33.34]This is diet, right?
[173:34.30]It's like diet, cherry, vanilla, Dr. Pepper, right?
[173:42.22]Yeah.
[173:42.74]Definitely, like, diet Pepsi is probably the worst drink.
[173:48.60]Cherry Pepsi's in the trash?
[173:56.02]Yeah.
[173:57.44]Yeah, it is.
[174:03.66]I have had this before.
[174:07.78]I've had this before.
[174:14.25]Uh-uh.
[174:15.49]No, I'm not... I don't like the cherry... Like, cherry Coke is alright.
[174:20.31]But no, it's not up there very high.
[174:24.65]Cherry Coke is okay.
[174:27.96]I don't remember this being something that I really liked.
[174:36.10]Done.
[174:38.91]Done.
[174:39.15]There it is.
[174:41.13]Done.
[174:46.27]Okay.
[174:51.06]I'm happy with it.
[174:57.54]Meats.
[174:59.28]Why is there a meats?
[175:05.24]There's a Taco Bell menu one.
[175:06.94]I don't even need to do it.
[175:07.82]There's only one item that belongs up anywhere.
[175:10.02]You already know what it is.
[175:13.72]You want to do meats?
[175:14.58]Alright, I'll do meats.
[175:26.75]I'm not doing jello.
[175:28.51]They're all gross.
[175:30.57]Oh, there's chips.
[175:31.37]This one's alright too.
[175:32.07]I'll do that after.
[175:41.01]What the fuck is this?
[175:42.13]G Fuel tier list?
[175:47.19]Where does Kool-Aid packets and pixie sticks fall on that list?
[175:57.02]Alright, well it's the meat one.
[175:58.22]I'll take the meat one.
[176:05.21]Cheez-Its.
[176:09.71]There we go.
[176:10.01]Meat.
[176:14.30]Let's try meat.
[176:17.82]Did I fuck it up?
[176:22.44]Meats.
[176:26.60]Okay, this is perfect.
[176:27.74]This is fine.
[176:28.32]I've had all of these, I think.
[176:31.70]Although I can't really determine what some of them are.
[176:36.82]Bacon is the first one here.
[176:42.13]And bacon is good, but it's also a meme food.
[176:48.82]Bacon is one of those things that for some reason the internet got ahold of it and became like the coolest fucking thing in the world.
[176:55.89]Putting bacon on something made it cool.
[177:00.69]Even if it wasn't cool at all.
[177:03.27]Bacon.
[177:04.33]Oh, whoa.
[177:05.34]You put bacon on that sandwich.
[177:07.28]Yeah.
[177:12.66]It's become a big thing.
[177:14.86]Like bacon.
[177:15.80]Okay.
[177:15.90]Let me tell you something.
[177:17.28]Bacon and the word like epic are the same word, right?
[177:25.31]If you put bacon on something, it makes it epic.
[177:29.79]That's just what happens.
[177:31.65]Nothing wrong with that.
[177:33.53]There's no problem with it.
[177:35.77]It just, that's what, that's just the kind of what happened.
[177:42.34]I don't find it to be like this God meat that people started putting on their ice cream.
[177:49.77]I don't, I don't think so.
[177:50.57]I think it's good.
[177:51.19]I like bacon a lot.
[177:52.13]I eat it all the time, but it's not like I put bacon on this.
[177:56.31]Therefore now it's the best.
[177:57.99]It's awesome.
[177:58.69]No, it's just bacon.
[178:02.78]I just eat it.
[178:06.32]Bacon is a condiment to me.
[178:08.90]It's not really, it's a side.
[178:10.54]It's a condiment.
[178:12.75]it's like putting mustard on your hamburger you don't like oh hey guys hey so today come on in for dinner I made a bacon what no it's it goes on stuff it's a side yeah but it's I it
[178:41.66]I'm being a hipster wouldn't I be being a hipster if I said that bacon is fucking so awesome epic cool that's mainstream well you're really gonna not like this
[179:09.79]Am I still a hipster?
[179:16.86]Is this salmon?
[179:17.80]Done.
[179:23.10]Done.
[179:25.42]Done.
[179:27.12]Sausage?
[179:28.96]Wait, chicken?
[179:33.02]What's this?
[179:33.42]Fried chicken.
[179:34.18]What's the difference?
[179:35.14]Isn't this chicken?
[179:35.56]Is that turkey?
[179:36.80]Wait, is that a turkey?
[179:37.42]That's a turkey.
[179:39.67]No, no, no, no, that doesn't go up there.
[179:48.46]This is pork.
[179:51.24]This is like a hamburger patty.
[179:52.42]Hold on.
[179:54.24]Oh, I'm going to make people angry with this.
[179:55.66]I know I am.
[179:59.79]It's a ham.
[180:00.41]I don't like ham.
[180:02.35]Not really.
[180:05.49]I think it's, yeah, I'm not a big fan.
[180:09.46]Also not a big fan of steak.
[180:14.32]I do like ribs.
[180:17.82]I would rather eat a steak than ham, though.
[180:26.35]These ribs?
[180:27.87]Hold on, I just need to get it on the plate first.
[180:30.11]Everybody, hold on.
[180:30.97]I need to just get it on the plate.
[180:35.50]What is that?
[180:37.13]Is that like white fish, like cod or haddock or something?
[180:40.03]What is it?
[180:45.32]I would put that up here.
[180:49.04]So I would put sausage here.
[180:50.48]No.
[180:52.04]Okay.
[180:52.58]Is this, what is that?
[180:54.52]Is that lamb?
[181:01.62]What is this?
[181:04.67]Brisket?
[181:05.11]Is that brisket?
[181:06.05]That doesn't look like brisket.
[181:07.58]Is it brisket?
[181:12.90]That's turkey.
[181:14.08]No, that's turkey.
[181:17.46]Maybe it's duck.
[181:18.76]Is that duck?
[181:27.67]That's chicken.
[181:28.57]So what's that?
[181:31.88]Why is it like different?
[181:32.82]It's like fried chicken and regular chicken.
[181:35.76]Yeah, it's unclear.
[181:39.26]I'll take a salmon and a 7-up, please.
[181:44.81]Pork chops?
[181:45.71]So then what is this, though?
[181:47.01]I don't know what that is.
[181:49.71]I think this is duck.
[181:54.09]I'm going to say that's duck.
[182:01.91]Okay, now hold on.
[182:13.50]Would I rather eat ham or duck?
[182:16.78]No, I don't like duck.
[182:18.84]It's too gamey.
[182:19.76]I don't like it.
[182:24.06]Would I rather eat like pork cutlets or cutlets over steak?
[182:27.94]I would eat cutlets.
[182:29.62]Sausage over...
[182:32.75]Yeah, I like sausage.
[182:35.49]Hamburger over... What is this?
[182:38.97]Is this chicken cutlet?
[182:39.69]This is pork cutlet right here.
[182:40.79]So that's chicken cutlet.
[182:41.55]Is this chicken cutlet?
[182:42.25]Is this pork cutlet?
[182:46.33]I'm going to say this is pork cutlet and this is chicken cutlet just from my brain and they could be wrong.
[182:50.72]I'm pretty sure that pork is this one.
[182:56.38]I would rather eat a hamburger...
[183:00.34]than pork yes I probably would bacon it's just a fucking condiment I'm putting another list it's gonna be condiments how can you put like bacon over hamburger it's that's not this is mustard would I rather eat I'd rather eat chicken turkey salmon I think this is good
[183:33.00]Tofu I find to be just something I never want to have.
[183:38.79]It's weird.
[183:39.81]It's... I just don't, I don't like it.
[183:45.03]I really don't.
[183:46.90]I actually really don't like soy, like, anything.
[183:50.78]Really at all.
[183:52.12]I don't like soy milk.
[183:53.82]I don't like soy, like, tofu.
[183:55.84]I don't like... It's just that I don't like it.
[184:02.01]It doesn't do it for me.
[184:06.18]But I do also not like steak.
[184:10.82]I wouldn't order steak at a restaurant.
[184:12.84]If I had an opportunity, it would be something up here.
[184:14.88]It wouldn't be a steak.
[184:22.25]No.
[184:23.45]I'd rather eat steak than ham.
[184:26.11]But I'm a fly and fish kind of person.
[184:30.54]salmon is probably my favorite meat or you know turkey probably would be my favorite if it was easy to get all the time and easy to make salmon is really easy to make turkey is not easy to make if you want to make like a fucking Thanksgiving turkey it takes like a day to make it you can make this in five minutes
[184:58.47]Would I rather have, like, a piece of cod or a hamburger?
[185:01.61]Hamburger.
[185:04.95]It's still up here, though.
[185:05.77]But does it... Yeah.
[185:07.23]No.
[185:08.07]Yep.
[185:09.25]No.
[185:14.21]Learn to cook turkey.
[185:18.17]You forgot forehead.
[185:21.41]Salmon, turkey, chicken, hamburger meat.
[185:25.25]White fish, chicken cutlets, bacon, bacon, ribs, sausage, pork cutlets, and then steak, ham, duck, and tofu.
[185:40.22]Bring it on.
[185:40.84]What's next?
[185:44.94]Why are ribs and steak so low?
[185:46.36]I'm not a big red meat fan.
[185:48.56]I like burgers and I like meatballs.
[185:50.48]And that's kind of it.
[185:54.96]Game of Thrones characters?
[185:56.12]No, that's like spoilers.
[186:14.27]Not seeing what I want to do yet.

[186:26.34]I'll do chips.
[186:37.21]Is this the full list here?
[186:41.28]This doesn't look like a full list to me.
[186:49.60]Is this a full list?
[186:50.42]This is not.
[186:50.90]There's not enough on here.
[186:56.12]ultra tier no epic American chips that's not you just made that you just made that is bacon on there epic American chips yeah this is this is a I want a bigger list
[187:27.81]Why do I feel like this is a smaller list?
[187:31.97]Like you gave me a bunch of like Smash Brothers clones.
[187:45.94]Is this not in a variety here?
[187:48.77]It's just all Cheetos, Doritos and Lay's.
[187:55.19]Where are the Pringles?
[187:56.63]Okay.
[187:58.49]Where are the Munchos?
[188:00.67]I don't see them on this list.
[188:07.97]Chipped Tears, I got another one, hold on.
[188:19.10]Alright, hold on, this is a little bit more.
[188:25.02]They're on this list, alright, I think this is the one.

[188:58.67]Wait, you can add?
[189:02.22]Can I add stuff?
[189:07.82]Cape Cod or Zoomer chips?
[189:09.34]Cape Cod has been a chip brand since I was like fucking four years old.
[189:20.45]Zoomer chips.
[189:36.28]Is this one better?
[189:42.26]Alright, okay.
[189:46.65]Cape Cod is a Redditor chip.
[189:52.03]Oh, this is the list we're doing because I already know which one is this.
[189:56.51]Oh, yeah.
[190:01.29]Yeah.
[190:03.25]Holy shit, those things are amazing.
[190:08.97]If you've never had those before, don't let the title fool you.
[190:12.62]These are fucking amazing.
[190:14.58]They're so good.
[190:16.48]Where's Baked Lays?
[190:17.28]It's going to be a fight up here.
[190:20.12]It's going to be a brawl up in the S rank.
[190:23.80]I can't have more than one or two.
[190:25.34]But it's going to be a fight up there.
[190:28.38]Goldfish is definitely A or B tier.
[190:29.84]Where are those Munchos?
[190:39.13]No muchos on this list, huh?
[190:50.28]Fuck, no.
[190:58.30]This is going to be a fight up here.
[190:59.72]Hold on.
[191:01.40]It's actually going to be easier to go bottom up with this.
[191:09.09]These taste like dog food.
[191:29.34]All Lay's brand that are not baked Lay's go down in D.
[191:33.74]Because they're fine.
[191:35.68]They're fine.
[191:37.40]But once you eat two thirds of the bag, you're just left with greasy fucking breadcrumbs.
[191:47.44]The bag is full and it's this fucking big.
[191:50.75]The bag is huge.
[191:54.17]Down here are the chips.
[191:56.39]Here's the layer of ones that have not been sat on by like a fat guy on a plane.
[192:01.14]Making lots of plan references today.
[192:02.60]Under there is just breadcrumbs.
[192:07.44]I'm sorry.
[192:09.65]I do like, but look, I'm not a Lay's hater.
[192:11.81]I got baked Lay's up in the best chips that I've ever had.
[192:17.53]It's the classic ones.
[192:18.43]It's the classic, just greasy ones.
[192:22.69]Any more of those?
[192:23.19]Because they're going right there.
[192:24.25]Bugles F. No, I don't like them.
[192:32.92]Bugles taste like cereal without any, like, sugar on them.
[192:35.90]They just taste like... Like, just... They're nothing.
[192:39.14]They just taste like air.
[192:41.58]It's just eating dry air.
[192:45.08]I eat dry air every day here anyways, in Vegas.
[192:59.16]I also really, really do not like the Ruffles brand.
[193:03.29]Like the Ruffles, you know, I don't like these either.
[193:09.93]Tostitos, this is an interesting thing here because Tostitos are nothing without salsa or queso.
[193:15.38]So I don't know if they belong on this list.
[193:17.32]Are these just standard default, just eat tortilla chips out of the bag?
[193:22.18]Or am I implying that I'm eating these with salsa or queso?
[193:30.39]Are we implying that I'm enjoying them with salsa?
[193:36.08]Just the chip.
[193:38.28]Just alone, without the chip, without it.
[193:41.64]Well then, I mean, I would never do that.
[193:47.21]I would never eat Tostitos unless I was dipping it in some type of viscous fluid that had like a spicy or cheesy flavor to it.
[193:55.19]No, I would not do that.
[193:55.87]I'm not going to do that.
[193:56.50]Why would I do that?
[193:58.20]I'm just not going to do that.
[194:00.05]Regardless of how they taste.
[194:01.97]I'm sorry.
[194:07.20]These are the ones that taste... Which are the... Where are the dog food ones?
[194:09.86]Yeah.
[194:10.34]No.
[194:11.08]All the Frito heavily flavored.
[194:12.46]That's a heavy spice.
[194:13.68]Heavy flavoring.
[194:15.08]They're just cat food, dog food.
[194:16.78]I can't eat them.
[194:21.02]Regular Fritos, though.
[194:21.93]Those are good.
[194:24.35]Hey, can you focus here?
[194:25.51]Come on.
[194:25.73]What's going on?
[194:26.17]Camera.
[194:27.99]Focus.
[194:28.25]Alright.
[194:38.13]Where are just the default Doritos?
[194:39.79]There they are.
[194:44.99]This is going to take some revisions.
[194:49.26]Doritos Jacked.
[194:51.22]I don't want these.
[194:52.50]I would never buy them.
[194:55.00]This is like Doritos Chili Lime.
[194:56.86]I would never buy them.
[194:58.24]I like Cool Ranch less than I like the regular Doritos.
[195:06.90]I just wouldn't buy... I don't... I'm not going to eat... I'm not going to eat these.
[195:12.85]I am actually a sucker for these.
[195:15.19]I love the compilations.
[195:17.27]Pretzel, cheese squares, like Sun Chip, I love, because you get a little bit of everything.
[195:23.53]So, I like having that.
[195:27.66]Although, I would never buy these.
[195:30.52]In fact, this is at the very bottom.
[195:34.91]All Sun Chips are at the very bottom.
[195:42.34]Yeah, they are.
[195:47.34]No, I- they're- Once you eat one of these, if I had one, then I would be done.
[195:54.45]Eating more than three, four, five, or six Sun Chips, they just start- it doesn't- it just starts to taste strange.
[196:04.44]it's my first chip this is up here but it's eating like at least I'm gonna say like a half like a couple dozen I wouldn't sit down and eat a whole bag of these I would eat a whole bag in fact I've done it before many times I have gotten the normal regular size bake lays and I'm talking within the last like couple of weeks not like oh I've done that before like no I did this like two weeks ago I ate the whole bag I do it all the time I wouldn't do that with these
[196:38.18]um which what are these which one of these moldy doritos I don't I don't I wouldn't get them I don't know it's like something all over cheetos um I would put cheetos up the the regular uh like the asymmetrical cheetos I like more than the puff ones so yeah
[197:06.39]Flamin' Hot, I'm not a fan.
[197:08.81]Just give me the regular ones.
[197:11.61]Flamin' Hot, not only does Flamin' Hot taste worse to me, but it increases the amount of shit on your hands by at least twice, two or three times.
[197:24.55]I will eat Flamin' Hot Cheetos.
[197:27.44]You fucking have to wash your hands.
[197:30.82]It's awful.
[197:32.08]And I don't know why that's considered a good thing.
[197:35.25]Oh, dude, I got so much Cheetos, Flamin' Hot dust on my hands.
[197:38.67]Why don't they make it so they're not like that?
[197:41.35]Nobody wants to do that.
[197:42.33]Where can you eat those?
[197:43.63]Where can you reliably eat Flamin' Hot Cheetos?
[197:48.11]You have to be like in your bathroom.
[197:52.90]It's part of the trademark.
[197:58.08]Dirty hands.
[198:00.58]But it's something with Flamin' Hot.
[198:01.70]The regular Cheetos don't really, they do that a little bit.
[198:05.44]But you may as well have, like, fucking murdered somebody after you eat Flamin' Hot Cheetos.
[198:10.56]You're like a blood all over you.
[198:15.51]And no, I'm not going to lick the, like... You know where your fucking hands have been on a daily basis?
[198:20.65]You want to talk about, like, getting sick?
[198:23.33]And how we need to be more health conscious?
[198:25.14]Yeah, put your hands as far down in your mouth as you can over and over again.
[198:29.08]That's a great idea.
[198:32.83]no that's like so like bizarre you gotta like yeah you gotta wash your hands but what if you're not in your bathroom what if you're walking down the street with a bag of flaming hot cheetos okay you've eaten like 20 of them now what do you do what do you do you're walking around where are you what do you do you yeah and then you go like this
[199:04.00]That's better.
[199:05.32]Or like... Yeah, that's better.
[199:08.30]That's sanitary.
[199:13.79]Just pour the bag in your mouth.
[199:16.79]Eat them with chopsticks.
[199:21.27]These do that, but these do that way more.
[199:25.18]Therefore, they're at the bottom of the list.
[199:28.89]Chex Mix mid-tier.
[199:31.21]I like this style more than I like Chex Mix.
[199:32.93]I don't really like Chex.
[199:36.69]Combos are really good, but combos are actually also really bad too.
[199:42.14]You can only get these at like gas stations.
[199:45.44]So there's something going on there.
[199:58.15]Goldfish Flavor Blasted is just the same complaint that I have about... Ow, my hand.
[200:04.08]That hurts so fucking much.
[200:05.82]That hurt a lot.
[200:08.38]And I'm going to complain about it.
[200:09.68]Flavor Blasted Goldfish are the same thing as Flamin' Hot Cheetos.
[200:13.26]They just put extra dust on it and... Just give me the regular ones.
[200:18.19]Those ones are better.
[200:19.97]Funyuns are okay in small doses.
[200:22.13]They're pretty good.
[200:23.35]Although, I don't think I'd put them at B.
[200:27.65]Cheez-Its are definitely... They're up here.
[200:32.73]Now, is this Tabasco?
[200:34.77]Spicy?
[200:35.27]Because if those are the ones, they'd belong up here.
[200:36.75]I'm not a big fan of any of the other really Cheez-It brands.
[200:39.75]I like the hot ones.
[200:40.35]I like the super toasty ones.
[200:41.37]And I like the regular ones.
[200:44.01]Cheetos Puffs.
[200:44.91]Again, like I said, I would rather have these, the regular ones, the asymmetrical crunchy ones over the puffy, cloudy ones.
[200:58.53]Oh, those are white cheddar.
[200:59.51]Yeah.
[201:01.25]This may have been a mistake.
[201:05.74]No, they belong up here.
[201:06.58]The white cheddar ones are actually insane.
[201:15.10]Again, this is like Flamin' Hot Cheeto.
[201:18.46]Oh, yeah.
[201:19.58]Do we have a chip?
[201:20.34]Yes, we do.
[201:21.24]Do we also have an evil version of those chips?
[201:24.14]We better.
[201:28.37]Chester's, what are these?
[201:32.67]I don't know what these are.
[201:35.68]No, they're the fries, the little like, like little hot fries.
[201:38.54]Where are the hot fries?
[201:42.16]Why are they not in here?
[201:46.47]Okay, can I pretend that these are the actual hot fries?
[201:55.20]But can I also pretend that they are the regular cheesy ones, not the hot ones?
[202:00.93]Because that's not on this list.
[202:01.91]I'm not going to put these up anywhere high.
[202:03.75]I'm pretending that these are the original fries.
[202:09.27]I don't need to pretend.
[202:09.92]Are they on here?
[202:10.36]They're not on here.
[202:15.90]Okay, so this is hot.
[202:17.68]These are the regular mild hot fries.
[202:21.55]These go up here.
[202:24.07]Yeah, they have regular ones.
[202:25.17]Oh, yeah.
[202:25.87]They're insane.
[202:26.37]They're amazing.
[202:27.40]They're everything you love about the hot ones, except they're not hot.
[202:34.54]Just add them.
[202:41.04]Yeah, the Andy Caps.
[202:42.65]Andy Caps is the one I'm talking about.
[202:44.17]I don't know what these are.
[202:59.14]What's going on in here?
[203:05.00]Taco-flavored Doritos?
[203:08.71]I don't think I would want to get those.
[203:14.13]Gordettas.
[203:16.71]This looks like a little combo mix thing.
[203:22.11]I think I've had it a few times, but I don't really remember.
[203:24.75]It's the same thing as Chex Mix to me in my brain.
[203:28.95]um salt salt and vinegar chips are really bad just tastes like rotten potato chips it tastes like potato chips of the bag
[203:59.79]It was open.
[204:03.05]I'm sorry.
[204:05.09]I'm sorry.
[204:06.05]They just pee.
[204:07.81]It's just urine chips.
[204:11.35]That's what I think of.
[204:12.19]I'm sorry.
[204:12.65]It's just urine potato chips.
[204:14.53]That's it, and that's all I have to say.
[204:19.97]I really, really dialed up the polarization here in chat, and I didn't mean to, but I'm being honest.
[204:31.59]I'm just being honest.
[204:36.69]I am fucking fuming.
[204:43.94]I personally disagree, but I understand and respect your opinion.
[204:49.98]Thank you.
[204:50.22]Alright, we got Pringles here.
[204:53.25]There's no normal Pringles somehow.
[204:56.09]There's just sour cream and onion Pringles and pizza Pringles, which I don't really like either one of them.
[205:01.30]In fact, regular Pringles, I think, are not even the best ones.
[205:04.90]I think cheddar Pringles, I think, are my favorite.
[205:23.85]Honey mustard Pringles.
[205:24.77]I've never had them.
[205:25.71]Those sound pretty good.
[205:28.01]Honey mustard Pringles.
[205:32.34]I would rather eat any Pringles over any Lay's though.
[205:36.32]That's for sure.
[205:38.96]Kettle cooked Lay's.
[205:40.56]I mean, we already have the, I mean, these, I wouldn't even, I don't want these.
[205:45.58]These are essentially the same idea, except these ones have barbecue sauce on them.
[205:51.59]These ones are just better.
[205:55.15]um pork skins I've never had these before I actually need to put like another hold on let me do another row of I've never had this before because there's at least at least six of these that I've actually really never eaten uh never had
[206:18.21]I've never had these Doritos.
[206:21.32]I've never had whatever these are.
[206:24.88]I've never had them.
[206:31.65]I don't know if I've ever had these.
[206:32.81]I have this weird memory of me eating them, but I don't think so.
[206:40.75]The rest of these, I've never had these pork skins.
[206:43.07]I've never had like these hot and spicy.
[206:45.89]I've seen these before because they always say that they're $2.
[206:50.93]It's printed on the bag everywhere.
[206:55.88]But I've never had them.
[207:00.10]I've never had these.
[207:00.90]I've never had these.
[207:03.26]I've never had these.
[207:06.97]And these are bad.
[207:08.11]They're just, it's like, it's just, it's me.
[207:10.73]You eat saltines.
[207:11.65]It's a, it's like, it's just a saltine 2.0.
[207:13.13]Uh, I don't know.
[207:16.41]What are these potato sticks?
[207:17.61]I don't think we've ever had those.
[207:27.77]So let's start from the bottom.
[207:32.25]Which one of these that I really don't like what I, what I want to eat the most.
[207:37.08]probably these no I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't choose those over any of these probably probably bugles because it's oh look it's weird and I haven't had these in 10 years and oh wow I can't believe they have these here that would be the only reason
[208:04.85]These other Doritos flavors, I would probably try them.
[208:09.33]Like, I've had them a couple times.
[208:11.29]I would be like, ah, I guess... Okay, if there was a Doritos shortage, and I really wanted Doritos, and I had to get them from... I had to eat them, it would be those.
[208:25.96]I don't want the hot Mr. Munchies.
[208:28.65]The Tostitos would be all the way at the bottom.
[208:33.58]Triscuits, Tostitos would be at the very bottom.
[208:37.27]You can't enjoy Triscuits without a piece of cheese or a piece of pepperoni on it.
[208:43.87]This is implied.
[208:45.01]I asked you guys this.
[208:47.01]Eating Tostitos without salsa is just a cracker.
[208:50.77]Eating Triscuits without a pepperoni on it or a little spread or a dip, I wouldn't do that.
[208:56.91]I'm sorry.
[208:57.27]I just wouldn't do it.
[209:06.16]Crackers are good.
[209:09.08]If I'm at the grocery store, I'm not going to go, Triscuits.
[209:13.44]Get them in the cart.
[209:14.90]I can't wait to eat a handful of those, like 20 of them today, right now.
[209:22.34]I'm, no.
[209:29.21]Do I know how pepperoni is made?
[209:32.47]uh I don't know some guy some some guy in a pizza restaurant I don't like like sings and then they they just appear on the plate I guess I don't know lime tostitos are the worst
[210:02.16]these are original when I put chips in a sandwich I used to do that until I got hurt I used to put potato chips in my tuna sandwich until one day I took a bite and it literally like pierced up into my mouth and I said I'm never going to do that again
[210:22.01]It hurt me.
[210:23.09]I got hurt.
[210:24.80]Okay, so this is done.
[210:26.32]I would not want to eat these.
[210:28.70]I really don't like salt and vinegar.
[210:29.80]I really don't.
[210:32.16]Okay, the D. These are ones that I would eat.
[210:38.30]But I wouldn't choose.
[210:40.34]Right?
[210:42.32]I would eat these, but I wouldn't choose these.
[210:43.86]That's where I put D.
[210:53.62]Fuck, I wouldn't choose any of these.
[210:56.10]These are all on the same level.
[210:58.62]So do not be fooled by this list going kind of descending down this way.
[211:03.22]No, they're all the same.
[211:04.72]I wouldn't get any of these.
[211:06.08]I would eat them, but I wouldn't... No, they're all on the same tier for me.
[211:09.15]All of them.
[211:11.72]Okay, moving on.
[211:13.24]Now this is things that I would pick on a rainy day.
[211:16.23]If it was rainy outside and I was like, it's fucking raining out.
[211:18.79]I want to get a snack or something.
[211:20.19]This is one of those.
[211:21.39]This is like it's sunny out.
[211:23.29]This is like a rainy shitty day.
[211:29.43]I think bakelays just goes to the front.
[211:35.91]Just because I would eat bakelays no matter what.
[211:46.59]I would eat combos way before I would eat Chex mixes, I think.
[212:00.20]Yeah, that's good.
[212:03.88]Yep.
[212:05.54]I love nachos Doritos.
[212:10.14]I don't love Fritos though.
[212:14.57]This is like a, wow, I really like these.
[212:16.25]I don't really, I don't really like Fritos.
[212:19.86]This is a problem.
[212:30.66]Yeah, this is a problem.
[212:34.10]I would, yeah, I would choose Cool Ranch over Barbecue Bake Lays, I think.
[212:41.94]I would eat Fritos over, no, I wouldn't.
[212:47.32]That's accurate.
[212:51.22]Yeah, I would definitely choose Fritos over Chex Mix.
[213:00.17]This is... I don't think I need to change anything here.
[213:04.09]This is where it's going to get hard.
[213:06.63]Alright, this is the difficult part.
[213:08.55]Trying to decide which actually is my favorite snack.
[213:13.78]These two are up here.
[213:18.62]Goldfish come down a little.
[213:20.14]In fact, I would choose Nacho Doritos over Goldfish.
[213:25.68]Very small margin though.
[213:30.98]Would I choose Cheez-Its over Doritos?
[213:43.51]These are scary.
[213:48.86]reason why goldfish are so scary is because I buy the bucket do you know the giant like a high school milk carton I buy the big one the one that's supposed to feed like 40 people and you just you sit there and you're watching TV or a movie and you eat like 25 people's worth of servings in those they're dangerous
[214:20.82]Why do I have Cape Cod so high if I don't like kettle chips?
[214:23.00]I love kettle chips.
[214:25.44]I just don't like the... I just really don't like barbecue Lay's kettle chips.
[214:35.02]I wouldn't choose these.
[214:36.66]I'm not a big barbecue chip fan.
[214:40.39]If that's been clear, I guess.
[214:42.31]The only reason why these are up here is because they're baked.
[214:45.59]You have garbage tastes.
[214:52.17]Why are baked Lay's an S?
[214:53.27]Because baked Lay's have my favorite chip.
[214:58.35]And smart food is actually about to go up because I'm trying to figure out what my top three are going to be.
[215:04.48]And then just sitting here, I figured it out.
[215:14.26]Why is your opinion different than mine?
[215:19.80]Smart food is fucking delicious.
[215:22.15]It's white cheddar popcorn.
[215:24.11]Remember when everybody freaked out when white cheddar Cheez-Its were over here?
[215:30.35]What?
[215:31.23]What?
[215:32.51]Smart food is white cheddar popcorn.
[215:33.91]It's insane.
[215:37.59]Come on.
[215:39.99]Smart food.
[215:40.74]There's got to be something to agree here.
[215:44.48]It's fake popcorn.
[215:47.97]It's just, I don't know why a company would make fake popcorn when popcorn is the world's cheapest thing to produce.
[215:59.71]Why would you fake something?
[216:00.84]It would probably cost more money to fake than to make popcorn.
[216:14.24]What do you think is in there?
[216:16.36]Nah, I think it's plastic.
[216:18.00]Yeah, it would be like $4 a bag.
[216:21.30]It's bones.
[216:22.91]Popcorn.
[216:24.39]Popcorn.
[216:25.59]Pop popcorn.
[216:27.39]There?
[216:27.69]Are we happy?
[216:33.93]What would you put up on this?
[216:35.25]I'm just curious.
[216:35.99]Sun chips?
[216:40.01]The only place where sun chips belong are in a big bowl
[216:45.30]at a fucking retirees party and guess what I really hate to say this to you but that bowl is going to be just as full six hours later when party's over what else what do you want what do you want up there what do you want up there funyuns I've got nothing on funyuns they're actually pretty good
[217:26.58]I told you this wasn't going to be easy.
[217:29.93]Don't even come talk shit about rolled golds.
[217:32.59]I will delete the stream.
[217:33.99]I will turn the stream off and delete it.
[217:35.79]I will delete the VOD.
[217:37.53]And then I'll reupload the VOD on YouTube and edit that part out of you guys talking about it.
[217:42.61]If you don't think rolled golds, pretzels belong up here, then I'm sorry.
[217:46.27]You and I have an extreme disagreement.
[217:50.31]You like cheese.
[218:03.41]You just like cheese.
[218:06.55]Smart food, white cheddar.
[218:08.90]That's not accurate.
[218:09.86]Cheetah.
[218:11.64]In fact, I'm seeing something right now that I don't like.
[218:19.56]I would choose goldfish over Cheetos so that it doesn't belong down there.
[218:31.68]I actually would probably rather eat like 30 people's worth of goldfish over cheeses.
[218:41.82]Oh, he's climbing.
[218:42.74]He's climbing up there.
[218:43.64]What's the next Mortal Kombat contestant?
[218:45.48]What's up?
[218:46.10]Rolled gold?
[218:47.82]Is it Shang Tsung?
[218:49.23]Oh, he's taking them on.
[218:49.97]He's done.
[218:51.01]I would rather eat goldfish than rolled gold.
[218:55.65]What we got left?
[218:56.39]We got Goro.
[218:58.55]And then we got Shao Kahn.
[219:05.29]I would rather eat the hot fries though.
[219:46.36]not s tier it's not it's not it it's very close now this is I'm having second thoughts about those like handicaps fries because if you did look at the back of the of those fries this this is like 500 ingredients it's something crazy I
[220:14.04]The amount of shit that's on the back of that container is like too much.
[220:18.21]It's like laundry detergent amount of shit that's in there.
[220:21.81]But they're fucking good.
[220:27.99]Wow, you're so healthy.
[220:32.88]Did you... Were you present for the cereal segment an hour ago?
[220:45.60]I was not.
[220:47.22]Okay, alright.
[220:49.46]Check that out.
[220:50.64]There's plenty of cereals in there that people thought I was like a fucking eight-year-old for liking.
[221:07.59]Done.
[221:08.11]Done.
[221:08.33]It's done.
[221:09.05]Wait!
[221:10.97]Done.
[221:13.90]Am I okay with that?
[221:14.58]I'm okay with that.
[221:15.08]Done.
[221:16.93]Done.
[221:23.65]Done.
[221:24.11]Now it's done.
[221:37.39]Utz is not on the list.
[221:38.51]I know, it's unfortunate.
[221:39.25]Muncho's not on this list either.
[221:41.49]Muncho's would have been up here.
[221:44.13]See, the reason why Smartfood is here is because Munchos are not on the list.
[221:48.13]I am replacing Munchos with Smartfood.
[221:51.02]Smartfood would be down here.
[221:52.86]But it has to be up here because I have memories.
[222:00.57]Bakelays I get every single time I go to the grocery store.
[222:03.17]Every single time.
[222:05.95]They're a perfect little snack.
[222:07.23]I love them.
[222:08.49]Veggie straws.
[222:09.25]There are people that are Mr. Healthy talking shit to me right now, but if you've never had these before, they're so light and you could eat a thousand of them.
[222:18.62]They're really good.
[222:20.15]Try it one time.
[222:24.13]And the goldfish is just a classic.
[222:25.37]That's a classic snack.
[222:26.15]It has to be up there.
[222:29.38]You could take a handful of these straws and just... They're very crunchy.
[222:32.42]They're very... It's not vegetables.
[222:36.18]It's like potato starch.
[222:37.91]They're really good.
[222:41.21]They cost too much.
[222:42.35]They are kind of expensive, aren't they?
[222:47.86]Finalist.
[222:57.20]Veggie straws start tasting bad the more that you eat them.
[223:02.79]If I try Takis, you'll get veggie straws.
[223:05.01]If it's available, I... I don't know if Las Vegas grocery stores stock Takis.
[223:12.98]I've never seen them before.
[223:16.52]Amazon Prime them.
[223:18.98]Oh yeah, you can do that.
[223:24.57]You can just like Amazon, but what?
[223:26.16]I'm just going to Amazon a bag of chips?
[223:30.52]I would have to get like a box of them.
[223:33.96]You're going to tell me I'm going to Amazon Prime two-day shipping a bag of chips.
[223:40.10]That's like... I'm going to go to the grocery store for that.
[223:47.63]Overnight.
[223:48.81]No, that's like Postmates-ing or Uber Eats-ing a Gatorade.
[223:53.37]No.
[223:54.44]I'm not going to do that.
[224:02.84]Alright, we got any more?
[224:05.72]I'll do... I've been going for a long time here.
[224:12.21]We'll do... It's getting late.
[224:18.13]We'll do one more.
[224:20.89]One more.
[224:21.91]One more decent one.
[224:24.96]It's been about, what, seven and a half, eight hours or so?
[224:27.38]It's been a while.
[224:32.68]Video game, what is this?
[224:34.48]Video game tier list?
[224:36.55]Oh, like consoles?
[224:40.89]I'll do a console list.
[224:42.91]This sounds good.
[224:44.85]Is this a good one?
[224:47.51]Like a full console list?
[224:57.79]All games, every game list.
[225:03.19]Door handles?
[225:07.63]Alright, let's see what this one is.
[225:08.49]Video game consoles.
[225:15.67]Okay.
[225:17.53]We'll do this one.
[225:19.73]We can do this again.
[225:20.39]I have fun doing these.
[225:22.18]This is fun.
[225:24.01]I'm not enjoying this.
[225:25.97]This is great.
[225:26.83]I'm having a good time.
[225:28.80]This is like the new GeoGuessr for the next three weeks.
[225:33.04]Alright, so I'm a Nintendo person.
[225:37.62]I wasn't a SEGA person when I was younger, so take that bias into account.
[225:47.28]Alright.
[225:48.61]Where are we?
[225:49.05]Super Nintendo.
[225:49.61]There it is.
[225:52.17]The best console that's ever been made.
[225:58.59]I need F tier because this thing was just looking at the sun.
[226:05.07]Added row below.
[226:05.89]And it needs to be like F. Or like, no, I need to make another one that's like I never played it.
[226:13.92]So this is F. F. And I need to be, come on, capital.
[226:25.80]F and then I never played.
[226:28.98]Or didn't own.
[226:33.37]No, I never played, because I've played some of these and never owned them.
[226:37.79]No, I never played.
[226:44.17]Never played.
[226:46.54]This color has to change.
[226:47.34]Alright, we're good.
[226:59.77]you guys saying how many consoles did I own well we're gonna do those first we're gonna do the consoles that I actually owned uh original is this original Game Boy I mean yeah Game Boy um for what it was for what it was it was really good it was one of the first real mobile kind of platforms of the original Game Boy I loved belongs on b um
[227:27.90]Is this like a slip and slide or is this a console?
[227:29.68]I don't know what this is.
[227:30.46]This looks like a jumpy house.
[227:33.39]I probably never played it.
[227:38.69]What is this?
[227:39.57]What are these?
[227:43.35]Genesis.
[227:44.54]I thought the Genesis wasn't very good.
[227:48.86]It was the sounds of the Genesis that did it for me.
[227:53.12]Didn't have good sound effects.
[227:55.06]All the sounds and the music in Genesis all had that weird... You guys know what I'm talking about.
[228:00.78]I know at least some of you do.
[228:13.52]Super Nintendo had superior sound because obviously they got their sound from Sony.
[228:19.43]Sony helped them make the sound.
[228:21.09]That's why the sound chip is so much better than the SEGA Genesis.
[228:25.99]I wonder how many of you guys knew that one.
[228:34.54]False?
[228:36.32]That's not false.
[228:40.01]Alright, so what is this?
[228:43.47]I don't know what that is.
[228:46.70]And this is like another version of the Super Nintendo?
[228:49.96]Is this not Atari?
[228:51.06]Is it Atari?
[228:51.74]No, this is Atari down here.
[228:55.08]Regular Nintendo is up here.
[228:56.48]Nintendo 64 is up here at S. The regular Xbox I'm going to put over here.
[229:09.01]Xbox 360 goes down here because the thing was junk And I mean like hardware wise All you need this is video the guy cracking the egg in the fucking radiator man, come on this the thing was a D GameCube hold on this is important Is this the Wii U
[229:40.12]Definitely have.
[229:41.18]Is it a game and watch?
[229:45.20]I never had one.
[229:49.39]PlayStation 1.
[229:50.65]Here comes the fight up here.
[229:57.19]Dreamcast fucking sucks.
[229:59.19]Laughing my ass off.
[230:01.47]It's definitely a C.
[230:06.87]wow the Dreamcast fucking sucks LMAO I will never forget that I like I sometimes I'll be in the shower and I will just think of the all lowercase text the Dreamcast fucking sucks LMAO I will never forget it it's burned forever in my brain and it makes me laugh in the shower this is the uya
[230:38.42]Is that the Ouya?
[230:41.84]The Ouya.
[230:43.64]Did this thing even release?
[230:48.23]Wait, aren't these things worth, like, 500 bucks now because, like, nobody has them anymore?
[230:53.47]These things are worth a shitload now, right?
[231:00.25]I swear to God, I heard that Ouya's a, like, collector's item because they're just liquidated.
[231:08.58]It's the beanie baby of consoles.
[231:19.81]Switch is really good.
[231:20.75]It's just, it is.
[231:22.33]I had my doubts at first and I like, I was a kind of, I was kind of a shit talker at first.
[231:27.36]But it's, it's pretty, it's pretty great.
[231:36.86]PS2 is just one of the... There's so many good consoles.
[231:40.73]Well, let's get rid of the dumb ones.
[231:44.77]Is that a... Where's the SEGA CD?
[231:49.55]Virtual Boy F. Is this a SEGA Master System?
[231:55.06]The thing was pretty cool, actually.
[231:57.46]I had one of these.
[232:04.62]But we're talking about the best.
[232:09.59]ps3 was ps3 wasn't really that good I it was it was but I mean these two just they had a bunch of problems I think we'd like to forget about just how many issues the this generation of consoles really truly had they were kind of dog shit the hardware and the
[232:37.15]Some great games came out, but the consoles were just kind of bad.
[232:42.65]There was a lot of issues.
[232:50.54]The PS3 was like 500, 600 bucks at launch.
[232:51.44]Wasn't it something crazy?
[232:52.44]The Wii.
[233:11.00]That Wii was fucking awesome.
[233:16.43]It was.
[233:19.65]It was 599 bucks.
[233:25.55]It was great.
[233:26.11]You know how much time I got out of my Wii?
[233:30.19]So much, so much time.
[233:36.48]How much time did I get out of my PlayStation 3?
[233:38.74]Or my Xbox 360?
[233:41.86]I got time out of it, but this was the console that you just dumped days into because there was so much fun stuff you could do.
[233:50.21]I hit the fucking ball with the baseball bat every day.
[233:54.61]I played Wii Sports every fucking day for like a year.
[234:02.03]You know how many times I played, like, Viking on Xbox 360?
[234:05.93]Once.
[234:07.09]And I turned it off in two hours.
[234:20.80]Where's the PS4?
[234:32.30]Where's the Xbox One?
[234:41.00]In fact... It's really struggling right now to not put this up here.
[234:54.40]The PS4 is so good.
[234:55.44]It's so good.
[234:57.00]It is fucking... It's so good.
[235:00.84]The amount of exclusive games that they've come up with on this damn thing.
[235:05.32]The interfaces, it's really, really fucking good console.
[235:09.02]It really is.
[235:20.13]But is it better than PS1?
[235:23.05]Or the PS2?
[235:25.93]I got every PlayStation on here.
[235:27.51]I got every PS, all the PlayStations are on here.
[235:33.57]That has to go up.
[235:34.15]It has to.
[235:34.71]It's too good.
[235:35.71]There's like 5,000 games for the PS2.
[235:46.43]I did it.
[235:46.97]I'm not going back on it.
[236:01.00]PS4 is...
[236:04.61]It's done everything right.
[236:07.47]The PlayStation has done almost everything right.
[236:11.09]Except for a couple of, like, bumps.
[236:14.62]Just think of... You gotta... I'm thinking of games and, like, hardware and shit.
[236:20.48]Think of games that have come out on PS4.
[236:23.32]And then go, like, ten years ago and be like, okay, what are the... There's been some ridiculous games that they've put out over the last, like, four or five years.
[236:44.90]Too many handhelds.
[236:48.20]The PS2.
[236:48.58]I know, I know!
[237:39.44]Super Nintendo is never going to change.
[237:40.64]It's going to be number one.
[237:46.21]I'm trying to think of the games that I played on PS2 and they changed everything.
[238:03.05]The Master System was cool.
[238:05.52]The Dreamcast was cooler than the Genesis and the Master System.
[238:09.96]But it wasn't better than the GameCube, don't worry.
[238:15.24]But, uh... Let me get some other stuff on here.
[238:21.80]All these may as well just be empty boxes.
[238:26.49]What is this thing?
[238:28.77]I don't... It's just a Super Nintendo.
[238:30.71]It's like the new version.
[238:42.52]all these other ones wait is this the phone which one of these which one of these is the end gauge is this the end gauge that's f that was what a disaster uh okay this is Game Boy advance I the d I like the ds better than the Game Boy advance
[239:06.39]Although this is the 3DS, so I mean, the 3DS is just a better version of the DS.
[239:12.11]It's just a bigger screen in 3D.
[239:23.64]I'm not a handheld player.
[239:27.70]I'm not a handheld player.
[239:29.82]Remember, they're good, but I don't play them.
[239:39.98]Let me come back to this.
[239:41.38]Where's the game gear?
[239:44.14]Game gear.
[239:44.72]Where is it?
[239:45.36]Right here?
[239:46.14]That's the game gear, right?
[239:47.52]F. F. PSP.
[239:57.75]Is the PSP down here?
[239:58.65]Because that's an F2.
[240:05.68]Why is a Game Gear an F?
[240:06.58]Because it took like eight AA batteries, and in the ride to Grandma's, you'd have to replace them.
[240:14.13]It's not... It wasn't very good.
[240:22.65]Where is it?
[240:23.95]Is this the PSP?
[240:25.53]Is this the Vita?
[240:27.63]I'll give Vita a D because it made itself relevant for like a couple years.
[240:34.09]There's a PSP.
[240:34.95]F.
[240:37.36]No, wait, I played Grand Theft Auto on this, and it was pretty fun.
[240:40.08]Okay, no.
[240:41.56]That's a D. High D. No, that's a C. Not better than the DS.
[240:54.36]Yeah, I played the GTA on that, and it was, like, the first time I've ever experienced, like, a good, like, full open 3D GTA-type game on, like, a handheld, and it's the first time they did it, so yeah, whatever.
[241:04.01]Liberty City Stories, whatever it was.
[241:06.74]Yeah, it belongs there.
[241:07.68]Okay.
[241:08.96]But the... Thank fucking God.
[241:25.44]I would not have remembered it.
[241:26.38]I would have... Okay, here's the funny part of what just happened.
[241:29.17]If that was a thing and I did this again, this list would probably be completely different.
[241:37.01]This would be the same up here, but all these would be completely, it would be completely different.
[241:42.86]Because I'd have to think about every individual one again.
[241:44.54]Alright.
[241:50.50]I don't, I never, I don't know.
[241:51.62]This is the Canada console.
[241:52.82]I don't know what that is.
[241:53.42]I don't play it.
[241:54.84]I don't know what it is.
[241:56.30]Where's the, where's the Atari?
[241:57.46]Atari changed the world.
[242:00.75]So we're going to put Atari deserves to be somewhere in B. Without the Atari, there is no Dreamcast.
[242:06.39]And without no Dreamcast, there is no Game Boy.
[242:08.20]Without no Game Boy, there is no GameCube.
[242:09.58]Without no GameCube, there is no Wii.
[242:11.22]Without no Atari, there is no PS4.
[242:14.34]Therefore, it has to be here, holding the anchor down at B. Where's the Philips CD-I?
[242:25.25]And are we certain that these are not the same console taken at a different angle?
[242:29.03]The photo.
[242:34.68]I think they are.
[242:42.22]I don't know what they are.
[242:54.65]What is this?
[242:55.15]Is this the third 2x?
[242:55.83]Yeah, this is the third 2x, isn't it?
[243:02.17]32X was just a Genesis 2.0.
[243:04.55]Or is that the SEGA CD?
[243:10.73]They did a weird thing.
[243:12.57]SEGA had a strange console thing where it was like the 32X and the CD-I were the same console, right?
[243:18.40]Something weird?
[243:27.40]What happened?
[243:29.84]What the fuck was that?
[243:35.18]Did my internet drop?
[243:39.78]That's weird.
[243:41.26]It says I did not drop any frames.
[243:42.72]That's... That was weird.
[243:46.09]Chat just stopped moving.
[243:48.71]And it didn't say I dropped any frames.
[243:53.99]Weird.
[243:55.45]That's weird.
[243:55.85]Alright, moving on.
[244:00.63]Uh...
[244:07.19]What is this?
[244:09.63]Is this the Jaguar?
[244:11.21]I never played the Jaguar.
[244:25.18]What is this thing?
[244:29.38]I feel like I don't know what any of these are.
[244:32.20]This is...
[244:34.80]I don't know.
[244:35.14]This is like something that I would see this in like a 70s.
[244:39.76]I think this is in Space Odyssey.
[244:41.48]This is... It's old.
[244:43.10]It's really old.
[244:43.72]You can tell because it has like cigarette fucking stain on it.
[244:48.92]Somebody smoked in their house.
[244:49.85]This is a cigarette console.
[244:54.31]Old as fuck.
[244:54.97]That's fine.
[244:55.43]I don't know what it is.
[244:56.79]I don't know what this thing is.
[244:59.35]I don't know what this is either.
[245:04.92]What is that?
[245:09.52]What are all these?
[245:15.06]I don't have any recollection at all of playing any of these.
[245:23.24]So what are these two handhelds?
[245:24.30]What is this handheld right here?
[245:28.60]The Apple Pippin.
[245:34.35]Apple Pippin?
[245:40.83]That's what the console was named?
[245:44.16]Why would you name your console after the weakest character in the Lord of the Rings?
[245:50.10]Why isn't it like the Apple Gimli?
[245:54.77]Or like the Apple Aragorn?
[246:15.14]Because Pippin is a type of apple.
[246:18.89]Apple Gandalf.
[246:20.95]People would have bought it.
[246:24.27]What the fuck is this?
[246:29.87]The Apple Gandalf.
[246:30.87]I would have bought it.
[246:32.73]I would have bought it just to have one because it's fucking stupid.
[246:37.50]This is the game rectangle.
[246:38.80]Nobody knows what this is.
[246:40.02]What's this one?
[246:45.54]This is the WonderSwan.
[246:47.35]Okay.
[246:52.57]Is this the Neo Geo?
[246:55.81]I've never played any of these.
[246:56.64]Alright, let's go up.
[247:01.32]Oh, by the way, just in case anybody was curious.
[247:04.08]Just in case anyone needed to know.
[247:07.43]uh pink is doing a two uh two for forty nine dollars uh bra get one just buy one these ads I thought I had an ad thing on alright they just keep like popping in my face they're doing like the mobile game thing where just every like 10 seconds they just reload the ad to get an impression
[247:37.26]Alright, what have we got?
[247:39.13]I don't like this decision.
[247:39.91]I'm changing it.
[247:40.65]No, I'm not.
[247:41.95]I really do believe that's one of the best consoles.
[247:43.85]Is it?
[247:44.45]No.
[247:44.91]That's better.
[247:45.43]Is it that right?
[247:46.13]That's correct.
[247:50.59]Yeah, this is good.
[247:51.82]Wait, no, no, no.
[247:52.56]Hold on.
[247:53.60]Switch is not better than a regular Nintendo.
[247:55.94]Switch is better than the Wii, I think.
[247:57.14]Switch is better than the Wii.
[247:57.88]Yes, it is.
[247:58.16]It's going to have more shelf life.
[247:59.18]It's going to last a long time.
[248:00.00]It'll last like 15 years.
[248:04.21]The GameCube better than the Game Boy.
[248:05.37]Atari better than the Dreamcast.
[248:07.45]Way more influential.
[248:23.56]Microsoft really not doing very well, huh?
[248:28.78]No Microsoft stuff is above C for me.
[248:31.86]That's weird.
[248:38.00]This is much lower.
[248:42.94]You know what?
[248:43.34]I actually really didn't hate the 360.
[248:45.33]It just had a lot of hardware problems.
[248:52.97]The Xbox One is... It's so close to F, I think.
[249:03.11]If Wii U is F+.
[249:07.62]Xbox One is close.
[249:13.75]They really just dropped the fucking ball so hard.
[249:22.50]It's just not very good.
[249:25.98]I don't think I would put that down here, though.
[249:28.18]It's just barely there.
[249:39.41]It's sad.
[249:40.15]I haven't used... I have an Xbox One.
[249:44.57]Well, actually not anymore.
[249:45.35]I fucking gave it away.
[249:48.51]I gave it away.
[249:50.40]That's right.
[249:50.86]I don't have it anymore.
[249:54.94]Yeah, I haven't used it.
[249:56.08]I didn't use it for like a couple of years.
[249:58.74]It just sat in my closet.
[249:59.74]I had no reason to turn it on.
[250:06.07]So I just wiped it and gave it away.
[250:09.45]Yeah, I forgot that I even had it.
[250:12.60]Alright, so hold on.
[250:14.82]I got B that seems correct to me.
[250:25.91]Where's the DS?
[250:26.65]DS should be up here.
[250:30.35]Not this one, though.
[250:35.18]No.
[250:36.14]No.
[250:42.32]I feel like they're, like, the same thing, though.
[250:47.46]If I put, like, the DS at B, I want, like, that to be at B, too.
[251:01.71]Then do it.
[251:02.27]Yeah, but... It may as well just be the same thing.
[251:10.29]Okay, this is B. This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[251:12.64]This is B5.
[251:13.60]This is B5.2.
[251:14.40]This is the Xbox better than the Genesis.
[251:28.45]The PSP was... I can't in good conscience say that.
[251:35.36]That the Xbox 360 was worse than the PSP.
[251:40.87]That feels wrong.
[251:52.83]I think it belongs like this.
[251:55.63]That's fair.
[252:03.40]Because it wasn't bad.
[252:04.14]It wasn't bad.
[252:05.48]It was just kind of normal.
[252:12.92]that's I'm good with this alright ps3 Master System the vita which is the worst console that I wouldn't buy or wouldn't want to play no it's Xbox One it's Xbox One it is
[252:34.61]If you handed me a Vita right now, I'd say, oh, okay, I guess, yeah, I'll play something.
[252:39.41]Whatever, this is dumb, but I don't really, it's not dumb, but like, I don't, okay, fine.
[252:45.06]If you handed me an Xbox One and said, hey, play something, I'd be like, just take it back.
[252:48.22]Same thing with the Game Boy Advance, I'd be like, okay, this is, why are you handing me this?
[253:02.44]Master System 2, it's just like, hey, dude, here's a Master System.
[253:05.71]Check it out.
[253:06.21]There's like four games that were worth playing on here.
[253:10.27]They've been re-released like twice.
[253:33.35]If Xbox 360 is up here, PS3 has to be up here, but lower.
[253:38.79]And the original Xbox is going down here.
[253:47.62]This is fair.
[253:59.01]GBA does not belong in D?
[254:03.91]But I don't have anywhere to put it.
[254:05.71]Because I can't reliably tell you that I would rather play the Game Boy Advance than like the fucking SEGA.
[254:42.67]Oh, hey, how are you?
[254:43.61]Hey, sorry, my internet turned off.
[254:47.01]It's not like that's a normal occurrence every day.
[254:51.17]That's so out of the ordinary.
[254:53.97]I'm shocked that it happened.
[254:57.05]It's absolutely shocking.
[255:01.18]What the fuck is going on?
[255:02.18]It's 12.15.
[255:02.44]It's midnight.
[255:07.21]What is happening that the internet would just turn off?
[255:11.45]It's midnight.
[255:13.94]All those people playing Call of Duty.
[255:18.32]Everyone's asleep.
[255:20.20]What day is it today?
[255:24.22]What day is it right now?
[255:26.04]It's fucking Thursday at 12 Pacific.
[255:31.64]Why would the internet just turn off?
[255:48.98]Anyways.
[255:51.60]New face.
[255:57.46]No, I don't want to touch my face with my dirty hands.
[256:01.93]Alright, where were we?
[256:02.89]Let's finish this up before I get turned off again.
[256:06.83]Fucking computers, man.
[256:07.81]I swear to God.
[256:09.89]Electricity under the ground and shit.
[256:12.99]Alright, what was I?
[256:13.55]It was Game Boy Advance.
[256:15.95]I'll put it up here.
[256:17.59]But that means I have to downgrade the SEGA CD.
[256:20.78]Because the SEGA CD was dumb.
[256:23.03]It was real dumb.
[256:23.87]But it had a lot of fun novelty.
[256:32.77]We played every single SEGA CD game on this stream a couple years ago, whatever, right?
[256:38.79]It was fantastic.
[256:41.65]What a fun time that was.
[256:43.17]What a fun time that was.
[256:44.51]But I would be disappointed if that was the console that I owned, like, 20 years ago.
[256:49.05]Is this the SEGA Saturn?
[256:54.28]Oh, that's the Saturn.
[256:55.98]I did not know that.
[256:56.68]Okay, that belongs over here.
[256:58.80]Never mind.
[257:00.72]No.
[257:00.94]No.
[257:09.53]Okay, here's a question.
[257:10.29]What had less shit on it?
[257:11.88]What had less stuff to do?
[257:14.26]The SEGA Saturn or the Xbox One?
[257:18.08]Both had like a tiny library of stuff.
[257:23.00]What had less stuff to do?
[257:25.44]Yeah, it had to have been the Saturn.
[257:26.88]There was like 12, what was it, like 16 games were released for the SEGA Saturn?
[257:34.22]I don't think more than 20 to 30 games were released for that console.
[257:38.22]Right?
[257:40.31]30?
[257:40.35]That's at least like 200 games for the Xbox One.
[257:46.07]Alright.
[257:47.09]I think that's good.
[257:48.93]Now down here, what is the worst console that I've ever played?
[257:55.64]I've never played the Ouya, but I mean, like, come on.
[257:58.78]I'll just pretend it's down there.
[258:00.28]What's the worst?
[258:03.26]It's the N-Gage.
[258:14.01]It's the N-Gage.
[258:16.91]It had no purpose.
[258:25.22]The Wii U is worse than the Virtual Boy?
[258:26.80]No.
[258:27.10]The Wii U at least didn't give you a headache.
[258:29.74]You got actual physical damage done to your brain when you used this for more than an hour or two.
[258:37.43]This didn't damage your brain.
[258:39.11]This one did.
[258:43.29]Move the switch to S. I was fighting with that for a long time.
[258:47.90]I like this.
[258:49.36]I like this already.
[258:52.66]No, I'm questioning now.
[258:57.55]There you go.
[258:59.85]There is your list.
[259:16.14]No.
[259:19.04]Do a Jerma tier list list.
[259:20.84]Which of my tier lists is the best?
[259:23.62]You're going down too many layers there.
[259:30.15]You sure the PS1 is better?
[259:31.97]Better is not enough is the right word.
[259:33.23]But PS1 was just a lot of influential stuff.
[259:40.13]A ton of great games.
[259:42.81]A ton of like their series got their start on it.
[259:47.25]Super Nintendo, you can't beat it.
[259:48.31]It's the best console ever made.
[259:50.11]Um... It's just... You just like cheese.
[260:01.79]Alright, guys.
[260:03.07]I think that's gonna be it.
[260:05.51]I'm sorry that we had so many problems today.
[260:08.90]But... It was really bad today.
[260:14.74]And it wasn't even bad in a sense of... It wasn't even dropping frames.
[260:21.04]It was just dropping everything.
[260:23.32]The whole thing would just turn off.
[260:25.41]That sucks.
[260:28.79]So, sorry about that.
[260:30.39]I think that's like four or five VODs.
[260:37.35]Not much I can do.
[260:39.07]I knew they were doing maintenance.
[260:41.35]They were doing something.
[260:42.15]They were upgrading...
[260:45.93]the node or something.
[260:46.85]They were doing something.
[260:48.79]So who knows?
[260:50.03]Maybe they either fucked something up or maybe it's one of those scenarios where they're still working on it.
[260:56.10]Because the internet here was turned off for like eight hours or so.
[261:00.24]Six hours or so, I think.
[261:02.42]Last night going into today.
[261:05.74]So, I don't know.
[261:10.49]Why is the switch so high?
[261:13.75]Because for the longest time,
[261:16.80]And I'm talking more than 15 to 20 years I have been searching and hoping for an entertainment device to take into the bathroom with me for my 40 minute shits.
[261:34.37]I used to bring my computer into the bathroom and plug it in and like set up a desk in the bathroom and sit there.
[261:47.76]I used to, it was bad, I used to sit, I used to bring my computer into the bathroom, set it up on like a stand-up pop-up table, and then plug everything in and sit on the toilet for a long, long fucking time.
[262:05.96]And even after I was done, I didn't, because what a pain in the ass that was to get it all in there.
[262:12.43]So, my legs, my legs would start to tingle
[262:18.58]I would sit there for an extra, like, 25 minutes, and I would have to, like, I would be getting, like, tingly legs.
[262:27.45]Because I was sitting there for too long.
[262:29.73]And that's what made me have to get up.
[262:40.86]I think I remember my mother, at the time, fighting this.
[262:46.13]And eventually just being like,
[262:49.90]whatever like you do you if you're gonna do it if you're gonna do that then go for it I think at first she's just like what what do you bring why are you doing all that why are you bringing all that stuff into the bathroom it's like uh because I wanted I just I'm like working I I don't know I was an idiot no no don't I'm gonna turn off I'm gonna turn off listen to me
[263:13.00]Before I go, before I turn off, I want to do the bits, but it's going to be fucked up.
[263:16.18]Hold on.
[263:17.04]Alright.
[263:17.58]Long story short, I can bring the switch into the bathroom and I can shit on it and keep my hands close and not have to worry about my legs tingling so I can get up whenever I want and put it over.
[263:29.43]Okay, done.
[263:30.59]My internet's going to turn off.
[263:32.05]So let's try to get some of these bits done before we get shut off.
[263:38.26]Done.
[263:38.46]Done.
[263:42.55]Let's get... No, not BRB.
[263:47.25]I will see you guys later.
[263:47.95]The next time you're going to see me, I've got some work to do on a certain stream.
[263:54.97]So you will see me after this weekend.
[263:56.82]I'll be back on... What's the day?
[264:01.08]One, two... Wait, wait, what day is it?
[264:07.12]I will be back on Sunday.
[264:10.10]So it is... Right now it is Thursday.
[264:12.33]I'll be back on Sunday.
[264:19.16]There's a couple things I want to try to get started.
[264:20.68]I want to try to do a few things on...
[264:25.72]I want to try to set up the Where's Waldo stream, so I'm going to work on that and see if we can get a good announcement I can make next week to set that all up.
[264:34.86]If you don't know what I'm talking about, you'll know very soon.
[264:38.70]I also am obviously going to work on the other stream, too.
[264:42.56]So I will see you guys on Sunday.
[264:44.18]Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
[264:48.24]But for now, let me try to get through these bits before the internet turns off.
[264:51.51]And if it does, I'm sorry if I miss your bits or your subs.
[264:55.91]It's kind of out of my control at this point, but I'm going to try.
[264:57.93]We're going to rapid fire these.
[265:02.40]Which usually means I'm going to do it much slower than normal.
[265:06.80]And some of these may have been broken up.
[265:08.73]I hope not.
[265:09.27]Let me actually... Hold on.
[265:16.10]Let me get this open.
[265:16.80]But thank you for joining me.
[265:17.54]It was a lot of fun.
[265:18.16]Kind of a long one.
[265:22.36]Playing with Star was a lot of fun.
[265:23.43]It was fun teaching him how to clean a house.
[265:35.91]Raid Vinny?
[265:36.89]Yeah, I'll raid Vinny after this.
[265:39.47]That sounds about right.
[265:41.67]Alright, so let's go down earlier to...
[265:45.09]Today, I want to see where this cuts off, because the stream turned on and turned off like five times.
[265:51.53]Let me make sure this is correct.
[265:52.83]I think it is.
[265:57.87]And earlier, I think because the stream turned off, I missed a couple of big donations, and I want to make sure I touch upon them.
[266:05.57]So at some point when the stream was having problems, Lady Wild Moonchild gave $50...
[266:13.34]Oh, Vinny's going to end in 30 minutes?
[266:14.62]Oh, okay.
[266:15.22]Well, it's late.
[266:16.94]That's okay.
[266:17.42]We can hold the raids off then.
[266:23.49]Unless, wait, is Joel streaming?
[266:29.49]Where's Joel?
[266:32.69]Alright, we'll raid Joel after this.
[266:40.10]Well, let me see if we're streaming.
[266:42.10]It's late.
[266:43.30]Let me get through this.
[266:45.74]Let me, let me... Get through the bits.
[266:49.58]And I don't really want to speed through these, because, I don't know, that's kind of rude.
[266:53.72]Like, oh, tank tank tank tank tank tank tank!
[266:56.22]I hate doing that.
[266:57.26]Because, and right now I'm like kind of up against the wire here with the internet, but... Uh, but thank you, Lady Wild Boonchild, for, this is $50.
[267:08.28]I finally got a job after recovering from a chronic illness.
[267:11.60]Your streams always cheered me up in a darker moment, so I wanted to share some of my first paycheck with you for seeing me through hard times.
[267:18.54]Thank you, Jerma, for the great content and for facilitating such an amazing community.
[267:25.45]Well, I'm really, really, really glad to hear that you're recovering from whatever it is.
[267:30.91]Thank you for the huge $50 drop.
[267:35.36]That's a lot of money for anybody to give anybody.
[267:38.50]So thank you for that.
[267:39.54]And thank you for being part of this community.
[267:42.02]Because without engaged... Engaging people like yourself... It's... It would be kind of boring.
[267:50.67]You know?
[267:51.89]So having a bunch of really, really fun, interesting people around is good.
[267:55.29]Very good.
[268:00.92]Thank you for the $50.
[268:04.27]We also had $10 from Fajita Meat.
[268:07.51]Thank you, Fajita Meat, for the $10.
[268:09.85]Look on the bright side, Jerma.
[268:10.85]You being short means you are the last one to get hit when it rains.
[268:15.44]You still get hit at the same time.
[268:18.78]When it starts to rain, everybody gets hit at the same time.
[268:20.58]It's an extra 0.0023 milliseconds.
[268:24.24]It's not a big deal.
[268:27.59]Thank you for $3 to Valentora.
[268:31.11]And they say, big boop, haha.
[268:32.97]Big boop.
[268:38.36]Thank you for the $3.
[268:39.16]Thank you, FreudianWeapon, for the $5.56.
[268:40.70]They just say, hello.
[268:44.40]Hello.
[268:44.88]Oh, they're from the soundboard, right.
[268:46.26]Hello.
[268:48.10]Thank you for the $5.56.
[268:52.56]We also had $5 from Infectious Frostbite.
[268:57.04]They say, silent viewer here, love the streams.
[268:59.25]Keep it up.
[269:02.07]Will do.
[269:04.19]Thank you so much for the $5.00.
[269:08.75]I'm going to keep going.
[269:09.79]Keep streaming.
[269:14.45]Thank you to Azzy Dreamer for the $3.
[269:15.95]Hey, Dreamer, long-time fan, second-time donator.
[269:20.40]Funny enough, I've actually followed your Twitch channel ever since you beat Deltarune on stream.
[269:25.94]This is Ant beating Jevil for his try.
[269:27.58]Forgot to clip that part in.
[269:30.44]This is just the first time I had both the free time and money to contribute to a livestream.
[269:34.89]Don't worry.
[269:35.73]I'll still be here regardless of whether or not you play Deltarune again.
[269:38.73]Oh, hold on, hold on.
[269:40.83]P.S.
[269:41.13]Your battle with Jevil still gives me chills to this day.
[269:43.61]What a god of a gamer.
[269:44.63]Seriously.
[269:48.02]Thank you.
[269:50.12]Sometimes I turn it off.
[269:55.18]Dermastretch.
[269:56.16]Oh god.
[269:58.66]But thank you, Azidreamer.
[270:01.62]And I really appreciate it.
[270:02.34]Thanks for the three bucks.
[270:07.52]Uh, Devakitty, thanks for the $2.50.
[270:08.56]Hey, Jerma tell, the Star's apartment is a jungle story.
[270:12.51]Also, holy shit, cereal is a fucking excuse to sell kids candy for breakfast.
[270:18.47]Uh, I don't... I don't... I don't remember.
[270:20.11]I think his heater was broken.
[270:22.48]And it was just pumping hot air into his apartment forever.
[270:28.66]And he couldn't even be in there.
[270:30.08]It was like 85 degrees in his room.
[270:32.93]It was something like that.
[270:38.03]That might not even be accurate.
[270:39.11]I know it's something like that.
[270:42.17]Something was wrong with his heater.
[270:43.43]200. 200.
[270:55.88]It was a fun stream, Jerma, but I genuinely hope you... Holy shit!
[271:07.37]Thank you, TheFunkyChicken, for the $5.
[271:10.61]Hey, Jerma, I made this faux movie trailer using green screen and other stuff.
[271:16.31]Be cool if you showed it.
[271:20.40]I think what I'm probably going to do...
[271:22.64]Because there still are green screens that trickle in.
[271:26.81]And little videos that trickle in.
[271:29.77]I think it's time.
[271:33.05]It's time... To set aside stream time for these.
[271:42.76]Instead...
