[00:01.30]I'm gonna say, explain why you're late.
[00:04.22]He's late.
[00:06.88]I said this before, and I'm gonna say it again.
[00:08.65]I think a lot of you guys stop reading after 3.
[00:11.55]It's 3 to 4 p.m.
[00:15.21]I think you guys just stop reading after 3.
[00:16.75]Hey, what's going on?
[00:25.54]How you doing?
[00:27.62]Welcome back.
[00:29.60]We can't count past three.
[00:31.38]Yes, you can.
[00:32.91]I've seen you get to like 6,000 in this chat.
[00:36.95]But how you doing, guys?
[00:37.65]Good to see you again.
[00:41.93]Hope you're having a good day.
[00:43.08]I'm going to play something interesting today.
[00:47.76]I feel like I'm going to love this game.
[00:50.34]I've been holding on to this for a long time.
[00:52.88]And we're going to give it a try.
[00:59.90]What happened to Beautiful Joe?
[01:03.61]Beautiful Joe is hanging out back here for a little while.
[01:08.75]I'm not sure Beautiful Joe will make a triumphant return.
[01:17.92]He's fucking exhausted.
[01:22.96]Maybe I'll play it.
[01:24.12]It's ready if this game's not any fun.
[01:28.16]If this game's not any good, I'm gonna play it.
[01:31.40]But, I've been sitting on this one for a long time, too.
[01:36.89]Chat killed beautifully.
[01:38.25]Yes, they did.
[01:40.41]Yes, they did.
[01:43.57]Only like six of us like that fucking game currently.
[01:53.54]Take Beautiful Joe out into the... Oh my god!
[01:56.91]He's the... What a great, cool game!
[01:59.99]You know what?
[02:00.47]It's over.
[02:00.97]We're done.
[02:01.37]We're gonna move on.
[02:04.09]He is fucking exhausted.
[02:06.29]We're gonna play Casino Inc.
[02:10.16]tonight.
[02:11.14]Casino Inc.
[02:11.62]is a casino management game.
[02:12.92]You make a casino and you run it.
[02:15.82]I'm all over this.
[02:18.28]This game came out like 15 years ago.
[02:20.78]So... I wish they'd make a new one.
[02:23.44]I want a new up-to-date casino game.
[02:26.78]You gotta set the fucking restaurants, the hotels, the tables.
[02:31.13]It could be troublemakers you have to throw out of the casino.
[02:33.45]It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[02:36.37]I like Beautiful Joe, too.
[02:38.11]Depot Happy.
[02:38.91]Me, too!
[02:45.19]Thank god it's not Beautiful Joe.
[02:47.07]I- okay, well, you gotta give- I- oof.
[02:51.43]Alright, if you remember when I played Kenshi, and I got like three or four streams into Kenshi, and it was like, get off this game.
[03:00.52]It was like, don't ever play this game again, this game's boring, this game sucks.
[03:05.02]That was like, Beautiful Joe was like Kenshi 2.
[03:09.49]It was wild.
[03:14.54]Kenshi is great, though.
[03:15.72]Yeah, but hey, you live and die by the chat hive mind, I think.
[03:27.48]Kenshi actually sucks, though.
[03:29.48]See what I'm saying?
[03:30.08]Now imagine that 5,000 times.
[03:42.41]And she is good.
[03:45.25]But without further ado, we're gonna play Casino Inc.
[03:50.29]I'm happy.
[03:51.07]I can't wait.
[03:51.65]This game is gonna be fun.
[03:53.69]I'm gonna fucking have all kinds of like blackjack tables.
[03:56.03]There's gonna be slots.
[03:56.77]You can make an arcade in this game.
[03:58.45]Yup.
[03:59.51]You don't have to make a casino.
[04:00.55]You can just make an arcade with arcade machines and pinball machines.
[04:03.67]You don't even have to make a casino.
[04:05.27]Money doesn't have to be involved at all.
[04:09.96]Chad is like an untrained dog.
[04:13.37]You have to be the alpha male.
[04:16.11]Right.
[04:17.29]But what happens when 5,000 untrained dogs are all running at you at the same time?
[04:23.76]Am I gonna... Start banning people?
[04:27.14]Start timing out 3, 4, 5,000 different people?
[04:31.39]Maybe I will.
[04:34.39]Maybe I will.
[04:36.03]Maybe I'll start to lock it down.
[04:37.85]Maybe I'll start to lock it down.
[04:41.41]I would be careful if I were you, Chad.
[04:44.65]You're on thin ice.
[04:49.95]And then my chest just fucking sticks out and I lean my neck back.
[04:53.11]Alright, let's go.
[05:02.41]Let's see.
[05:02.96]Can you see it?
[05:07.02]You should be able to see it.
[05:12.02]Can you see?
[05:14.00]I know you can hear it.
[05:15.66]I know, no, no, I know the window's tiny.
[05:17.06]The window is tiny.
[05:22.58]That's just temporary.
[05:23.83]Because it's an old, it's like a game from like fucking 1993 or something.
[05:28.15]Konami?
[05:30.15]Konami made this game?
[05:31.39]Holy shit.
[05:33.71]Fill up the space with your face.
[05:36.12]No, this is just temporary.
[05:37.02]This is the first little loading screen.
[05:39.98]Konami of Europe made this game.
[05:42.34]Interesting.
[05:44.72]Alright, I have- by the way, I'm prepared for this stream.
[05:48.26]I did at least five of these.
[05:51.15]Like, at least five or six of these.
[05:53.29]I did these.
[05:54.65]So we don't have to- oh, here we go, he's gonna have to learn it.
[05:56.71]No, I know- fuck, I know how to play the game.
[05:59.77]This is a little loud though, isn't it?
[06:03.33]Let's see.
[06:03.65]Turn it down a little.
[06:06.83]Whoa!
[06:09.99]That's- that, like, scared me.
[06:15.21]The rumors have got me all fucked up.
[06:18.64]That's still so loud.
[06:19.84]Okay, how is it possible that even at like 10%... That's okay, right?
[06:31.62]Right there.
[06:33.75]That's good.
[06:34.61]Right?
[06:35.37]Right there.
[06:36.09]Alright, that's good.
[06:38.67]Here we go, new game.
[06:40.25]Select your casino theme.
[06:41.61]I know you can't see it.
[06:43.65]I'll read them to you.
[06:47.20]You can never imprison a honk.
[06:50.70]What?
[06:52.82]I can never do an impression of a honk?
[06:54.60]Is that what you're saying?
[07:01.33]You were saying?
[07:01.79]I'm sorry, what was that?
[07:03.87]Alright, we got Cleo's Casino.
[07:12.55]Cutthroat's Casino.
[07:13.81]This looks pirate-themed.
[07:16.10]You can kind of see it.
[07:19.04]The Toy Box Casino.
[07:22.48]It's kind of freaking me out though.
[07:23.94]Why would you... The casinos are for adults.
[07:28.13]Not for f- Why is it like building blocks and shit?
[07:32.31]The Tex Casino.
[07:33.37]The Centurion Casino.
[07:37.02]Polar's Casino.
[07:37.88]Ooh, I like this one.
[07:39.00]It's like made out of ice.
[07:40.52]The Lucky Seven.
[07:43.46]Cheat- Cheetos Casino.
[07:47.70]Cheetahs casino the Astro casino whoo Astros kind of cool.
[07:50.70]It's like a UFO themed The club club casino Clams casino or the crypt casino is like an undead theme Which one really I'm leaning towards the toy box casino is just odd and
[08:12.23]I like the underwater one, the clam, the cheetos, crypt casinos, yeah, it's cool.
[08:22.96]Club Penguin.
[08:23.90]Toybox is based.
[08:26.58]That's such an annoying building.
[08:30.79]Imagine having to live next to this building.
[08:35.11]Toybox is based.
[08:36.45]Is it Toybox is based?
[08:39.13]Based on what?
[08:40.03]Yes, I know.
[08:42.78]Uh, well, no.
[08:44.26]Clam is based.
[08:48.68]Alright, I'm gonna flip a coin.
[08:50.44]I'm gonna flip a coin.
[08:52.90]Heads is clam.
[08:54.58]Tails is toy box.
[08:56.53]And if it lands directly on top standing up, it's the crypt.
[08:59.97]Here we go.
[09:02.45]I forgot everything I just said.
[09:04.13]I'm not even kidding.
[09:04.61]I don't remember.
[09:05.67]What was it?
[09:07.90]Heads was what?
[09:08.62]I have no idea what it was.
[09:09.92]I just called it and I don't know.
[09:11.48]Heads was what?
[09:14.28]Heads was the Clam?
[09:14.96]Alright, Heads was Clam.
[09:18.48]Heads was Clam?
[09:23.90]Clam, okay.
[09:24.56]Alright, let's do the Clam Casino!
[09:28.53]Uh, we can choose where we want to go.
[09:31.07]We have Little Hope Springs, Fortune Falls, Chancersville, Cashmore Heights, Dollarington, Chip City.
[09:43.71]Okay, Chip City demands the- You can't read this, but I'll just read it to you.
[09:46.62]Chip City demands the best from you.
[09:48.14]It's the hardest city in Casino Inc.
[09:50.72]Little Hope Springs is the perfect challenge to start.
[09:54.46]So this is just in difficulty.
[09:57.64]This is just difficulty.
[09:59.05]So we can do 1, 2, 3, 4.
[10:00.81]It's 1 through 6 in difficulty.
[10:02.87]I'm not doing Chip City.
[10:03.83]I'm not starting at the hardest fucking difficulty.
[10:05.47]This is probably a hard game.
[10:07.43]Chip City is based.
[10:08.41]No.
[10:08.93]We're going to, like, Fortune Falls.
[10:15.03]I'm doing Fortune Falls.
[10:20.19]Fortune Falls is a mid-sized city with plenty of nightlife to attract visitors.
[10:24.00]Bars, restaurants, theaters, nightclubs, fast food outlets, and entertainment of a sleazier nature are all there to entice your would-be customers.
[10:32.70]Added to all that, three casino-owning companies have a head start on you.
[10:36.84]Your ultimate aim is to dominate the gambling and entertainment markets and to put two of the three major competitor casinos out of business.
[10:42.87]In addition to building an efficient business empire, you will need to use cheats, troublemakers, and hitmen exclusively, extensively to harm your opponents.
[10:52.53]This is... Why are they like command points?
[10:58.15]The challenge in Fortune Falls shouldn't be underestimated.
[11:00.58]You'll need good advertising, transport, security, and lots of cash.
[11:05.56]I know it's small.
[11:06.36]I know it's small.
[11:07.04]It's about to be fixed.
[11:09.57]Alright, let's do this one.
[11:10.99]Enter your name.
[11:12.49]How about, uh, yeah, Jerma's fine.
[11:13.83]That's my fucking name.
[11:16.88]Here we go.
[11:17.90]Is this an RTS?
[11:19.50]Uh, kind of.
[11:21.92]What?
[11:22.94]What was that?
[11:31.90]This is a busy city with many tourist attractions.
[11:35.05]Just recently, gambling has been legalized.
[11:37.49]Gambling?
[11:40.27]Gambling's been legalized.
[11:42.03]Send in the choppers.
[11:47.35]It just became legal quick.
[11:48.76]Get like 10 fucking buildings up.
[11:51.37]You won't find it easy here.
[11:52.93]The competition will be tough.
[11:55.05]Not only will you have to build and manage your own gambling and entertainment empire, you also have to actively win customers over your opponents.
[12:02.34]Don't worry, I will.
[12:03.18]That's a good face cam.
[12:04.34]Yeah.
[12:06.90]What's going on with the suit here?
[12:08.56]Okay, this is a suit.
[12:11.42]What is this?
[12:13.22]Why is there a bunch of chewed bubblegum stuffed down his shirt?
[12:18.64]My job as head host is to get you settled in, show you the ropes, and then show you how to keep your visitors happy.
[12:25.10]Before we go inside, let's take a tour of the city.
[12:28.05]Yeah, I'd like a tour.
[12:28.85]Let's take a tour of the city.
[12:30.87]Visitors arrive at the busy railroad terminal.
[12:33.89]There are several one- and two-star hotels nearby.
[12:37.55]The city has good transport links from here to the better quality hotels to the north of the city and around the central square.
[12:46.38]Okay, so they come in on the railroad terminal.
[12:49.76]There are several one- and two-star hotels nearby.
[12:52.36]The city has good transport links from here to the better quality hotels.
[12:57.00]Okay.
[12:57.38]Okay, this is where we want to go.
[12:59.02]During the tour, you can scroll the views.
[13:01.16]Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
[13:15.81]Wait, who are these people?
[13:18.57]Oh, it's a senior.
[13:20.07]He's looking for something to do.
[13:21.00]We gotta give the senior something to do.
[13:22.80]Holy shit, this guy's locked in.
[13:26.64]This is a hell for this guy.
[13:28.75]Imagine being in this fucking position.
[13:32.55]A bus in front of you and a bus behind you.
[13:35.43]Holy shit.
[13:36.29]That's the worst possible scenario.
[13:38.26]Okay.
[13:40.40]Let's keep going.
[13:40.78]Okay.
[13:41.42]Oh, what the fuck?
[13:42.16]Hold on.
[13:42.52]There's a cafe and a bar across the street and I'm the casino.
[13:46.22]I got a bar in here too.
[13:47.32]Alright, I gotta make my drinks cheaper than that.
[14:03.46]There's the Clam.
[14:05.14]Clam's Casino on West Street.
[14:06.62]Yep.
[14:07.02]Alright.
[14:07.28]I gotta make my shit cheaper.
[14:09.10]Always.
[14:09.40]Canada Street.
[14:10.57]Boston Street.
[14:11.27]Canada Street.
[14:11.79]Tennessee Street.
[14:12.67]England Street.
[14:28.06]Really?
[14:28.20]Okay, just across the road.
[14:29.21]Oh shit, alright.
[14:30.05]Okay, this is the guy?
[14:31.01]The Cheetos Casino?
[14:50.70]Oh, I wish that was me.
[14:51.50]I wish that was me.
[14:52.14]Wasteland?
[14:52.64]This place is popular with high rollers.
[15:16.91]Why?
[15:17.33]Oh, the crypt!
[15:19.01]These are all the ones you were going to pick.
[15:21.63]This is Entertainment Capital.
[15:23.37]Yeah, whatever.
[15:23.87]Here we go.
[15:41.27]Okay.
[15:41.67]Two empty floors, 50 grand.
[15:48.21]Let's go.
[15:48.63]You ready?
[15:48.97]Alright, let's go.
[15:50.49]Inside the casino.
[15:52.27]Okay.
[15:52.43]Your first objective is to achieve a market share of 15% in gambling.
[16:00.17]Notice that your current objective is always displayed at the top of the screen.
[16:03.42]Get a market share of 15% in the city.
[16:05.26]Alright, I get 0%.
[16:06.80]Okay.
[16:07.08]Alright, let's take a look.
[16:10.30]This is what the floor looks like.
[16:11.44]Where's the entrance?
[16:15.68]Alright, this is the first floor.
[16:16.74]What do you want to do?
[16:20.32]We got a basement?
[16:23.41]Okay.
[16:24.49]You play chess in the basement.
[16:25.59]You play chess in the basement with fucking propane tanks.
[16:28.77]That's kind of... I don't know why those are down there.
[16:31.73]That's weird.
[16:33.05]We have second floor is just the same thing.
[16:34.77]Alright, first floor.
[16:35.89]Here's the entrance.
[16:37.17]Let's do, um...
[16:40.53]Oh, that's the exit.
[16:41.09]Where's the entrance?
[16:43.31]Oh, they didn't know.
[16:43.74]That's both.
[16:44.18]Okay.
[16:45.48]Alright.
[16:45.92]Let's say, coming out here, we can buy attractions.
[16:50.78]We do gambling, slot machines, just the whole floor.
[16:53.16]What do you think?
[16:56.88]Baccarat, blackjack, craps, poker, roulette, slots, slots, slots.
[17:01.90]Small sports betting.
[17:04.39]All slots?
[17:05.19]Low bet slots?
[17:06.51]Or what?
[17:07.94]Should we just have a bunch of, like, one-cent slot machines that take up the entire casino?
[17:11.70]But I'll lose money.
[17:12.44]I won't make any money.
[17:15.27]No, no, no, no, no.
[17:16.11]We're gonna... At the entrance, we'll have a few low-betting slot machines off to the side.
[17:20.65]So if you come on in, you're like, you know what?
[17:22.71]I'll throw a nickel in there.
[17:25.15]And then the cool shit will be over here.
[17:26.31]Alright, so slots, low bet.
[17:27.45]What do we want with this?
[17:29.89]Right here?
[17:33.66]Wait, wait, wait.
[17:38.29]Konami.
[17:39.95]Here's the funny thing.
[17:42.29]Konami slot machines are actually the only thing that makes them fucking money nowadays.
[17:47.33]So this is real life.
[17:51.17]Walk into any casino and go find this thousands, probably, of Konami slot machines.
[17:55.80]So, it makes sense.
[17:58.28]Alright, let's say right at the door, right here.
[17:59.96]How much is this?
[18:00.38]500?
[18:00.64]How much money do I have?
[18:03.16]Back to back, you think?
[18:05.94]Yeah, we'll just do them along the wall here.
[18:13.22]We want to have enough to really... There we go.
[18:15.12]Alright, that looks okay.
[18:18.72]Smart way to fund your game.
[18:20.30]I mean, yeah, if they've made any anymore.
[18:23.26]Alright, I gotta get these controls done.
[18:27.51]Because I can't, like, mouse scroll.
[18:28.61]This game's too old.
[18:29.25]Alright, what do you think?
[18:30.43]Should I do the same thing over here?
[18:32.53]Have just slots lined up?
[18:34.09]Low-bet slots?
[18:34.75]I can go in and configure these.
[18:40.01]That's what I'm gonna do.
[18:40.83]How much money do I have?
[18:41.45]46,000?
[18:41.53]Okay.
[18:45.91]right it looks good alright now slots medium bed no it can't just be slot machine I need some like decorations here let's start with this how do I pause the game it's paused right okay it's paused alright uh bean bags should there be bean bag chairs for the slot machines
[19:09.98]That seems stupid, but... What?
[19:12.02]Oh, shit.
[19:12.92]Nobody walked in.
[19:15.76]There's a customer.
[19:16.26]How do I pause a game?
[19:19.25]L-LC Matthews.
[19:20.69]Trailer trash.
[19:26.47]It just goes right... Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[19:29.39]Configure, configure.
[19:32.29]The only person in the casino is this trailer trash.
[19:35.79]Okay.
[19:36.99]Uh, jackpot frequency.
[19:38.25]We're gonna do...
[19:40.29]Low.
[19:40.53]Because these are fucking one cent machines.
[19:42.79]Return percentage.

[30:09.38]It's the end of the day.
[30:11.54]Wages have been paid.
[30:14.14]What the fuck was that?
[30:15.43]Okay, 30 people the day.
[30:16.69]Okay, so I'm alright.
[30:17.37]$5,000 in takings.
[30:19.13]Today's profit is in minus $5,000.
[30:20.47]That's horrible, but we need a bar.
[30:23.53]How about a small drinks bar?
[30:24.49]Uh, where should I put this?
[30:30.02]About, like... Right against the... Yeah, right against here.
[30:35.08]That'd be, like, kind of nice, right?

[32:21.76]Let's do... What should we do?
[32:23.32]Another row of slot machines, but this time they're gonna be more expensive.
[32:26.50]Medium bet slot machines.
[32:27.67]These are expensive.
[32:32.63]These are expensive.
[32:35.79]Let's go right here.
[32:37.65]One line, one line.
[32:41.37]We'll do it in a row, like this.
[32:42.53]I don't want to lose all my money.
[32:43.45]Okay.
[32:51.06]And then we'll do this here, too.

[34:18.14]Oh, man.
[34:18.36]Okay.
[34:18.54]I just hit him in the head with a hammer a few times.
[34:25.17]This is my cheat.
[34:25.61]Hold on.
[34:25.79]Yeah, I can...
[34:44.72]Cheats.
[34:46.06]Waiting in the basement.
[34:47.87]Okay.
[34:50.09]Go cheat somewhere.
[34:53.71]Go cheat at the... Which one?
[34:55.01]Which one's worse?
[34:55.83]The Crypt Casino?
[34:56.91]Which one's doing well?
[35:03.45]Go to the Crypt Casino and come back when you get like two fucking thousand dollars.
[35:09.57]You're on it.
[35:10.75]Going to the Crypt Casino.
[35:11.95]You have to be careful.
[35:15.25]Let me know when you get there.
[35:15.99]Alright, let's go back to our position.
[35:21.35]How's it looking?
[35:23.75]I quote, zero profit.
[35:25.01]Nobody, of course.
[35:26.81]This whole place is trailer trash.
[35:28.20]No one's going to pay $18 for a drink.
[35:32.94]I'm saying that just as a matter of fact right here.
[35:36.96]Right?
[35:37.30]Like, I'm just being... They keep getting raided because of hookers.
[35:43.00]No one's bought a drink.
[35:43.70]Wait.
[35:43.94]Wait.
[35:46.76]Here we go.
[35:48.16]Our first customer.
[35:49.18]The senior.
[35:52.96]That's not strong enough.
[35:56.36]Can I make him cheaper?
[35:57.06]15 bucks.
[35:59.72]He only cost 5 dollars to make.
[36:02.67]Discipline him.
[36:04.85]He's not breaking any rules.
[36:15.08]Leaving for the Crypt Casino.
[36:18.16]It's watered down drinks.
[36:20.49]There's trash everywhere.
[36:22.49]You guys need to work.
[36:26.15]Work.
[36:26.69]Clean.
[36:27.83]Clean this up.
[36:29.73]What are you doing?
[36:30.75]You're supposed to be... You're supposed to clean.
[36:32.83]You got a bag.
[36:34.58]I didn't even configure these.
[36:35.34]No, no, no.
[36:38.18]Okay, get off the bouncer.
[36:38.98]Okay, these are jackpot frequency.
[36:43.04]We're gonna do...
[36:46.40]Let's do medium and payout percentage low.
[36:51.57]Right?
[36:52.33]Like frequent jackpots, but not very much money.
[36:55.63]They're not janitors.
[36:59.39]Oh, fuck.
[37:00.01]They're not.
[37:03.13]Okay, we got two janitors now.
[37:05.65]31,000 bucks.
[37:06.15]I need more entertainment.
[37:12.89]Vacationer.
[37:13.95]Oh, he's going to gamble.
[37:17.15]Okay, profit minus 180, minus 160.
[37:20.05]Nobody wants to fucking play blackjack.
[37:23.07]Clean this place up a little bit.
[37:24.15]Everyone's supposed to play this shitty slot machine.
[37:27.19]Alright, slots bet.
[37:32.19]We gotta go through these.
[37:34.23]We need the jackpot frequency, return percentage, jackpot frequency, we need everything on low.
[37:39.23]All of them on low.
[37:40.01]Return percentage low.
[37:41.99]They're cheap slots.
[37:53.86]And the medium slots will have a medium return.
[37:57.02]That's how it works.
[37:59.86]Yes, of course it's rigged.
[38:01.76]If you put a cent into a slot machine, the payout percentage is way lower than if you add a $1 denomination spin.
[38:08.97]Don't you guys know that?
[38:10.33]That's how it works.
[38:13.79]I put the medium ones on low.

[43:15.33]Okay.

[43:58.56]Return percentage, we're gonna do jackpot percentage low, return medium.
[44:05.32]That's better, right?
[44:08.45]Then people will be more inclined to want to play, because they get more return, but they don't get as much big jackpots.
[44:15.05]Socialite.
[44:15.51]She's upset.
[44:16.21]Why?

[86:05.70]Seven bucks, disco night.
[86:13.53]I'm gonna get raided for hookers.
[86:14.95]Well, they're all upstairs.
[86:16.69]I'm, like, hiding them upstairs for some reason.
[86:24.48]Change the second floor to entertainment, not casino.
[86:26.60]I think there's only two options.
[86:27.60]I think there's only hotel and casino.
[86:32.23]Yeah.
[86:32.79]Casino floor, hotel floor.
[86:34.95]So if I click this, it's gonna be a hotel.
[86:37.75]No, I need that third floor.
[86:39.19]Or hotel.
[86:39.61]I need to... What do I need for staff?
[86:45.08]What's this?
[86:46.56]Hire a... What?
[86:47.96]What?

[87:08.60]This is right... two star escort.
[87:12.96]Right when they get out of the theater.
[87:19.03]What was that?
[87:24.30]It's the end of the day.
[87:25.17]26,000 bucks.
[87:25.41]Good.
[87:25.75]Wages have been paid.

[87:55.99]Word got out!
[87:59.05]Pick up all the old people!
[88:00.27]Holy shit, this guy can move!
[88:15.26]This is not even... I'm losing money on this.
[88:20.41]Yeah, why are they so sleepy?
[88:27.97]Alright, let's take a look.
[88:28.77]How's staff doing?
[88:30.65]Alright, this floor man is making a ton of money.
[88:38.14]Who's making the least money?
[88:41.54]You're not making... Okay.

[88:45.22]Right?
[88:45.94]Whatever this is.
[88:46.42]Six bucks a week?
[88:49.02]Nobody's coming to buy anything from you.
[88:50.95]We gotta make you happier.
[88:51.83]Let's do six bucks.
[88:55.77]Who's the most skilled?
[89:01.32]There's trash everywhere.
[89:02.52]This place is filthy.
[89:12.70]Edith Puke has been in this theater and has seen probably 15 pornographic movies in a row.
[89:25.91]There are no trash cans up here.
[89:27.11]Well, fuck.
[89:27.69]I gotta... Well, I just clicked out of the window.

[89:34.48]I think the game crashed.
[89:51.48]It's trying.
[89:53.58]It wants to.
[89:54.22]I did just save it like two minutes ago though, so that's good.
[90:03.02]Yeah, we're going to have to kill it.
[90:04.92]I did just save it.
[90:12.18]Oh, fuck.

[90:17.04]Control-Alt-Delete.
[90:17.94]Uh-oh.
[90:23.65]Even the task manager can't come up.
[90:26.63]Oh, shit.

[91:22.17]I can do Windows and Tab and pull the window up, but I can't get rid of it.
[91:26.93]Change your desktop.
[91:28.95]New desktop.
[91:30.81]Okay.
[91:32.77]Now...

[92:07.97]Alright, we're good.
[92:08.45]Let's just open it back up.
[92:19.01]And I did just save it, so that should be fine.
[92:25.72]Uh-huh.
[92:26.52]Uh-huh.
[92:30.22]Alright, let's see.
[92:30.80]Load game.

[92:35.49]Wait, this one auto-saved.
[92:38.65]Auto-save, this one's closer, right?
[92:40.98]17, 25, 48, 17, yeah, that's like five minutes before this crashed.
[92:52.59]Let's do it.
[92:59.98]Too many hookers.
[93:00.80]No.
[93:01.10]We just rewound about three minutes.
[93:04.16]See?
[93:04.94]Everything's back to normal.

[93:35.98]Buy it.
[93:40.27]Bus.
[93:42.27]The routes we're going to do.
[93:43.01]Remember, route one.
[93:43.75]Here it is.
[93:45.13]From church to the red light district over to the casino.
[93:50.35]Now we just need to have a shuttle.
[93:52.57]Are you sure I want... Yes, I am sure I want a new shuttle.
[93:55.52]In fact, I'll take two of them.

[156:48.54]It's going to be some expenses, but I'm going to go for it.
[156:52.54]A thousand bucks a piece.
[156:54.82]They make a lot of money.
[156:55.58]Alright, don't spend any more money.
[157:20.06]Yeah, apologize.
[157:21.16]Thank you.
[157:27.27]Good.
[157:30.87]1.7 thousand.
[157:33.90]This is where we just hold on for a little bit.
[157:35.44]This is losing so much money.
[157:36.82]Max bet.
[157:39.22]Make it higher.
[157:43.32]Oh, right.
[157:43.68]I fired this guy.
[157:50.70]Fire anybody else?
[157:53.78]No, we need some waiters.
[157:54.80]Oh, yeah, I need a hamburger staff.
[158:03.55]Level 4?
[158:04.19]I just need level 2.
[158:06.63]Alright, the reason why everyone is getting so sick is because you're a level 1 server.
[158:15.75]Blackjack is losing money.
[158:17.51]Yeah, a lot.
[158:23.39]Why is this one losing so much money?
[158:24.87]It's because somebody's just burning it.
[158:35.48]It's because of the cheaters.
[158:36.68]Is this person cheating?
[158:40.05]We don't know that.
[158:40.59]Where's the floor manager?
[158:51.51]Get over here.
[158:52.77]Check on this guy.
[158:53.37]Give him a look.
[158:59.87]I'm sure they're cheating.
[159:02.39]Oh, they are cheating.
[159:05.77]Interesting.
[159:08.35]It's the end of the day.
[159:09.82]Wages have been paid.
[159:12.80]Get him downstairs.
[159:13.48]This guy's got three or four brain in his pocket.
[159:17.06]Kill that guy.
[159:19.96]Oh!
[159:22.32]2400 bucks, that's my money, but he's a level 5 cheater.
[159:25.44]He's a level 5 cheater.
[159:27.48]And he's ours now.
[159:29.14]There's a convention starting soon.
[159:30.58]Cowboy convention.
[159:35.38]Excuse me?
[159:50.30]One of your ads has finished running.
[159:53.18]Action.
[160:02.44]That might be too much money.
[160:03.44]Maybe, uh, 30.
[160:04.54]30 bucks.
[160:06.76]They're all gonna come up.
[160:09.63]Alright, let's go.
[160:10.45]I'm gonna send this guy to take a ton of money.
[160:12.63]This is a level 1 cheat.
[160:15.33]I mean, we got a level 5 cheat at this point.
[160:18.07]I'm sorry.
[160:19.63]Eleanor.

[160:29.80]Goodbye.
[160:36.57]Now you... You are going to go take money from... He's a level 5.
[160:42.23]He could go in the Cheetah Casino.
[160:44.97]There's another fire at the Pasta Italiano.
[160:50.86]Wait, no, no, no.
[160:51.34]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[160:57.99]That place needs to be redesigned.
[161:00.67]Go get 5,000 fucking dollars.
[161:03.13]Can you do it at the Cheetah's Casino?
[161:06.23]Can you come back with five grand?
[161:13.87]Go check on the Pasta Italiano.
[161:16.57]Where is it?
[161:19.03]Pasta Italiano.
[161:24.07]Um, there's nobody...
[161:36.17]Actual firefighters this time.
[161:38.03]I think the chef may have done this.
[161:44.67]I believe the chef is responsible for this one.
[161:51.11]This is a nice place.
[161:52.47]I should buy it.
[162:00.50]Bleeding money somehow.
[162:02.28]Fuck you!

[162:14.69]I can't get the money back if I kill her.
[162:21.67]Minus 4,200 bucks.
[162:23.35]Look at the book on this thing.
[162:25.46]Come on.
[162:27.36]Minus 18, minus 24.
[162:28.64]I only have one bouncer?
[162:37.20]No, I have like three.
[162:44.68]Where's that cowboy convention?
[162:50.96]You need to go back downstairs.
[162:53.38]He's gotta hang out downstairs.
[163:01.20]I'll do another bouncer down here.
[163:06.83]Hang out down here.
[163:09.79]Holy shit.
[163:12.53]This person absolutely ran me through the absolute ringer.
[163:20.20]$7,800.
[163:25.00]You've got to be kidding me.
[163:30.75]Are these things running yet?
[163:31.93]Nobody on them?
[163:36.25]Nobody's using them.
[163:37.93]Jackpot low percentage.
[163:40.09]You know what?
[163:40.41]Let's make some... Let's get some... Let's get some turnaround.
[163:43.81]Big payouts on these machines.
[163:44.87]Because they're new.
[163:45.81]You got to make sure they pay out.
[163:49.25]Big jackpots.

[165:24.27]Okay, now go, um... There's nobody at these tables.
[165:29.79]Alright, you're good.
[165:31.47]Cheat again.
[165:33.97]There's just a bunch of waiters on here.
[165:38.12]I see a floor man.
[165:42.36]God damn it.
[165:43.00]Watch out.
[165:43.32]Do you see me?
[165:45.06]He knows.
[165:45.38]There we go.
[165:52.00]This thing's blocked by a wall.
[165:54.83]They made this cool attraction over here.
[165:56.51]Oh, it's a wedding chapel.
[165:57.91]Can I rob the wedding chapel?
[166:07.27]Come on.
[166:10.71]Come on, do it.
[166:12.73]Cheat!
[166:13.41]Wait, is he just playing the machine?
[166:15.14]I think he's just playing this.
[166:33.17]Steal!
[166:33.99]Don't just play, what are you doing?
[166:43.88]Are you gonna cheat a Baccarat?
[166:45.22]That's dangerous.
[166:54.88]There's no Floorman over here.
[166:57.10]This is a perfect opportunity.
[166:58.06]No Floorman at all.
[167:02.55]Here we go.
[167:04.91]1100.
[167:04.99]Let's keep on the eye out for Floorman.
[167:09.69]The security in this place really sucks.
[167:13.76]I'm gonna come here every time.
[167:14.66]I'm gonna come here and take five grand every single time.

[169:23.97]Well, cheat then!
[169:24.87]You just had a good spot!
[169:31.96]He's gonna get shot.
[169:33.44]He's not gonna get shot.
[169:35.68]He's not- He's gonna be fine.
[169:37.52]No floor man.
[169:40.01]Playing the blackjack.
[169:40.71]This is the- This is the one that I got most of my money taken from.
[169:44.87]Time to return the favor.
[169:48.19]He's not gonna get shot.
[169:51.00]This guy doesn't know what's going on.
[169:54.26]The floor man and the security team do it.
[169:56.48]This guy just carries out the sentence.
[170:00.50]Should I try to get $100,000 from this place?
[170:03.61]We're doing... What?
[170:06.37]Oh.
[170:06.97]Okay, you stay right there for a second.
[170:14.07]We're going to throw this guy out.
[170:21.09]Get him, get him.
[170:30.40]We're good.
[170:30.98]3,500.
[170:34.20]Gotta watch that elevator for floor men.
[170:37.26]No, this is the high roller.
[170:45.26]I'm walking out of here with at least $10,000 to $15,000.
[170:49.04]This is gonna pay for my new floor.
[170:50.98]Thanks a lot, Cheetah's Casino.
[170:57.42]Need a better view.

[171:19.83]Janitor's not gonna do shit.
[171:24.09]Good.
[171:24.29]Uh-oh.
[171:24.71]This guy's not gonna say anything, is he?
[171:34.01]You're constantly losing thousands of dollars?
[171:35.89]I've got 12,000 bucks.
[171:40.56]And I'm about to pull back another 10.
[171:45.62]What's the book look like?
[171:50.19]My book looks pretty good.
[171:51.19]$11,000, $12,000.
[171:51.23]I'm in the... Well, I mean, a few days ago there was an issue, but I got $1,600 in cash.
[172:10.20]Honestly, why stop at $20,000 when you can do $50,000?
[172:15.35]Blackjack is losing money?
[172:16.51]Yeah, but that keeps them in the casino.
[172:17.93]They'll win a hundred bucks at Blackjack, and then they'll blow it all in the high-limit slot machine.
[172:25.28]Why not a million?
[172:26.26]I mean, why not?
[172:27.08]You're right.
[172:27.42]Avoid in your rear.
[172:44.88]Get down.

[172:48.94]Get out.
[172:49.22]Get out.
[172:58.43]We're good.
[172:59.78]That's 6,200 bucks that I took out.
[173:01.46]Look at him.
[173:01.84]He was ready.
[173:04.68]Just make sure he gets out.
[173:09.98]He's almost out.
[173:10.58]He's almost out.
[173:11.08]He's almost out.
[173:11.94]He's almost out.
[173:12.46]He's almost out.
[173:14.12]Oh, go, go, go, go, go.
[173:16.04]Yeah, 6,200 bucks.
[173:18.62]They thought it was the old guy.
[173:19.76]Really?
[173:24.48]Wait, what?
[173:25.06]Imagine if they were beating up the old guy down here.
[173:33.68]That'd be so sad.
[173:34.50]Alright, we got 6,200 bucks.
[173:43.54]Good.
[173:44.18]That's a very good use of our time.
[173:48.50]Okay, let's see.
[173:51.54]Uh... Blackjack and Baccarat are getting crushed.
[173:55.61]The three slot machines, nobody's playing them.
[173:58.89]Is that too high?
[174:03.99]Why?
[174:04.27]Nobody's playing?
[174:04.81]What's the most... Roulette 1 is the most profitable thing.
[174:08.60]And all the slots on the left side.
[174:09.98]Why is nobody playing those?
[174:11.68]Can I close Blackjack down?
[174:21.24]Let's go check out the casino.
[174:22.10]How's it doing?
[174:27.14]Now that's what we're talking about.
[174:28.19]1845 bucks profit.
[174:29.65]That's good.
[174:31.69]Almost every room is occupied, too.
[174:38.68]Yeah, I'm gonna- I'll get rid of the, uh... ...the blackjack tables.
[174:43.50]They're just getting killed.
[174:48.52]This one's alright.
[174:49.34]This one... Yeah, we're gonna... We're getting there.

[175:14.71]He's sprinting to go to the sex show.
[175:24.92]Kind of want to see how this plays out.
[175:38.63]He voided the cough.
[175:49.72]He's not happy.
[175:58.83]I have no idea where he's even going.
[176:06.59]Yeah, thanks for the 6200 bucks.
[176:08.03]He's made it to his destination?
[176:10.44]Alright, well fuck it.
[176:12.36]This is a cheater.
[176:35.00]Okay, 21,000.
[176:35.56]I need to help.
[176:36.53]We need more.
[176:37.41]I need 44 grand.
[176:38.65]We need some more profit.
[176:41.13]Offer some services.
[176:42.79]Sure.

[177:02.15]How's the hotel doing?
[177:04.03]Uh, almost $2,000 in profits so far.
[177:06.09]Pretty good.

[177:39.62]Who's... Wait, is he yelling at this person?
[177:42.40]It's the cowboys.
[177:43.70]The cowboys are causing trouble.
[177:53.95]How much does he pay?
[177:54.61]There you go.
[177:58.92]$11,000 in profit.

[178:48.44]I'm not even happy, really.
[179:00.44]Let's go back down here.
[179:06.50]This looks like it was a pretty bad investment, unless it's because of the wall.
[179:11.63]Are they not going over here?
[179:12.53]No, there's a wall over here.
[179:13.39]No, there's not.

[192:03.35]Now what the fuck is this?
[192:06.69]Bribe brothels?
[192:20.49]So I can bribe brothels to send more prostitutes?
[192:29.18]I'm not doing this.
[192:34.54]No, thanks.
[192:41.38]Okay, let's see.
[192:41.78]What are the bus routes?
[192:46.38]I need to buy more property, too.
[192:48.54]That's another thing.
[192:50.68]Should I get some more buses?
[192:53.10]I already have a limo service.
[192:56.16]Where's limo one?
[192:57.22]Limo one's dropping somebody off.
[192:59.39]Maybe I should get some more buses.
[193:05.38]Another route?
[193:06.22]Another bus?
[193:06.72]Alright, I'm going to do another route.
[193:10.54]This route is going to be from the bank to the casino.
[193:22.75]Okay, we're good.
[193:24.72]From the bank to my casino and then back to the bank.
[193:33.73]And then maybe over to one of these hotels.
[193:36.61]Yeah, that's good.
[193:39.15]Yeah, because that'll, like, go around.
[193:40.84]It'll stop at this.
[193:41.68]It'll stop at, like, the bar.
[193:42.82]And it'll stop at the bank.
[193:43.78]And then, yeah, that's a good route.
[193:46.16]Add a couple of shuttles.
[193:51.64]That's enough.
[193:52.32]Okay, now I got... No, one more.
[193:53.52]Alright, I got good cars moving around.
[193:58.10]You gotta spend money to make money, guys.
[194:01.56]How's my hotel doing?
[194:02.98]Good profit.
[194:04.22]Good enough to make it go to $50 a night.
[194:13.16]What is this?
[194:15.30]Whoa, this looks like fun.
[194:16.18]Can I cheat?
[194:17.64]Alright, what's the best place to... Are they both going to the same table?
[194:30.26]Um, guys, I really don't think this is a smart idea to both cheat the same table.
[194:37.18]The floor man's right here.
[194:47.83]You're gonna get caught.
[194:48.45]Alright, get out.
[194:49.39]You go.
[194:50.59]Go home.
[194:50.97]Take the money.
[194:54.67]Do the bait.
[194:55.31]Good.
[194:55.49]Alright, just gotta watch this shit.
[195:01.99]The only floor man over here.
[195:03.17]Who's this?
[195:03.51]Uh.
[195:07.31]Are you telling on me?
[195:18.54]Why is it standing here like this?
[195:37.61]Alright, go down.
[195:39.25]Let's go to floor two.
[195:40.15]There's punching bags and stuff!
[195:43.35]Look at how much fun this stuff is!
[195:44.73]I need to make one of these.
[195:46.03]This place isn't really a casino, is it?
[195:50.81]Is there any sloths or anything?
[195:54.81]Oh shit, this is not even a casino.
[195:56.35]This is their second property.
[195:58.13]It's an entertainment property.
[196:01.52]Fuck.
[196:02.76]There's only three tables up here, and this guy...
[196:09.67]Can I distract this guy?
[196:10.59]Alright, go to a different casino.
[196:16.91]Go to the toy box casino.
[196:19.77]This is a bad place to steal.
[196:23.44]Alright, that's fine.
[196:25.24]Back to my property.
[196:30.02]What just happened?
[196:37.14]Alright, this floor needs some serious redesigning.
[196:43.18]This is taking money in, this is taking money in.
[196:44.88]We need some stuff here.
[196:45.90]I need some- I need a restaurant.
[196:48.10]A good one.
[196:49.03]A nice one.
[196:50.15]A big one.
[196:54.13]Medium kitchen.
[196:56.61]There we are.
[196:57.07]Let's put a nice restaurant over here.
[197:00.91]Okay, first of all, delete the fucking couch.
[197:13.33]Medium kitchen.
[197:15.31]Right there.
[197:16.93]It's not even that expensive.
[197:18.51]You know what?
[197:19.17]Let's do another kitchen this way.
[197:24.99]Let's do two, back to back.
[197:27.27]Make this a bunch of fucking seats and tables and shit over here.
[197:30.01]Put a wall up.
[197:32.64]Double kitchen.
[197:34.12]Small kitchen next to the big kitchen.
[197:39.46]This could be for appetizers and this could be for main entries.
[197:44.19]But why?
[197:44.69]I don't know.
[197:55.97]Goodbye.
[198:15.14]I'm gonna move the movie theater.
[198:19.48]To... Over here.
[198:20.94]He's never gonna hit 44k.
[198:24.29]Yes, I will.
[198:24.77]This restaurant's gonna be sick.
[198:26.35]I'm gonna get a five-star chef.
[198:34.57]There's only... Only one-star chefs.
[198:39.10]Great.
[198:39.96]Um, how about... P. De Shoes...
[198:44.04]P to shoes.
[198:48.95]Alright, P to shoes.
[198:50.79]Go for it.
[198:52.09]Let's get some waiters up here.
[198:53.91]I need three waiters, because there's already a waiter downstairs.
[198:55.83]Wait, they can, like, deliver food downstairs, right?
[199:01.25]One, two, three, four.
[199:04.35]Waiters.
[199:04.99]We're ready.
[199:06.53]Open it up for business.
[199:15.57]Give me a wall.
[199:16.15]Fucking dumbass couch.
[199:28.71]Get out of here!
[199:33.58]Minus 90.
[199:33.78]Ah, I spent money.

[199:56.33]Come on in!
[200:02.77]Okay.
[200:11.73]You can watch it through here.
[200:14.58]Configure the restaurant.
[200:18.16]You good?
[200:20.74]Kitchen, here we go.
[200:22.53]There's a convention starting soon.
[200:24.11]A wizards and witches convention will start in three days.
[200:27.43]Why did I say three?
[200:28.26]High quality lobsters or french fries?
[200:33.44]Steaks?
[200:37.38]They could do with an air filter in here.
[200:39.48]What?
[200:39.82]What do you mean an air filter?
[200:43.27]Is everyone going to eat?
[200:45.47]Is it just hookers coming to have dinner?
[200:54.73]No one's coming up here to eat.
[201:11.00]How much is this costing me a week?
[201:14.64]Nobody wants to eat at the nice restaurant?
[201:24.50]Sports betting is... Maybe we should change the minimum, too.
[201:27.75]No, I think that's good where it is, actually.
[201:34.73]You're hiding it behind a wall.
[201:36.27]Well, I mean, it needs to have a little space.
[201:41.52]Nobody wants to eat at restaurants with porn grunts.
[201:43.52]This thing's almost made me 10 grand, okay?
[201:46.84]It's the best thing in this entire casino.
[201:50.11]So it has to stay.
[202:01.20]Yeah, get out.
[202:03.76]Alright, I need something here.
[202:06.50]These are still making money.
[202:07.40]They're making a lot of money, actually.
[202:12.48]Just only have porn theaters.
[202:17.80]The waiters have no purpose if there isn't a kitchen on the same floor.
[202:20.57]Alright, so fire, uh... Fire this person.
[202:25.91]Wait, but they're... Oh, what was that?
[202:31.00]Somebody just, uh, ordering a drink.
[202:33.62]The bar that's on the floor.
[202:35.50]Well, um, sorry, we just got, we just got shown in real time that the waiters and waitresses serve drinks.
[202:44.76]Look at that.
[202:50.86]Lion chat.
[202:52.94]Akarat's getting killed again.
[202:54.55]Is he cheating?
[202:57.79]None of these aren't making any money.
[203:01.50]Oh, okay.
[203:02.80]Time to cheat.
[203:07.34]Okay, in the toy box.
[203:08.32]Casino, good.
[203:12.31]Where do I want to put him?
[203:17.53]Looking for floor men.
[203:20.85]Teen teen escort.
[203:31.12]That's not, that's not good.
[203:33.66]That's not good.
[203:34.64]Alright, there he is.
[203:35.18]Where's the floor, uh, master?
[203:46.25]Lie?
[203:46.69]Leaving for XXX stage show.
[203:48.75]I need a stage show!
[203:51.45]I'm gonna put an XXX stage show next to the, um, XXX movie theater.
[203:57.17]That's not even what it is.
[203:57.95]Why do I- God fucking dammit, floor man.
[204:04.18]You gotta find a spot where you can just cheat, dude.
[204:07.11]Right over here.
[204:12.13]Cheat.
[204:12.73]What?!
[204:13.03]Wait, somebody punched it?
[204:37.48]Oh, he lost it to the machine and he broke it.
[204:39.22]Oh.
[205:06.63]What is he doing?
[205:11.34]What is his move?
[205:11.94]Dumb stuff in here is older than me!
[205:15.88]Dumb stuff in here is older than me!
[205:18.06]Dumb stuff in here is older than me!
[205:23.61]I can see a cheat!
[205:25.29]Cheating?
[205:25.81]Oh no, not a pack-a-rat!
[205:27.25]Alright, well you just punch him in the face already.
[205:33.27]Dumb stuff in here is older than me!
[205:39.23]Why are we all watching?
[205:40.97]Somebody quit.
[205:42.81]What is going on?
[205:45.41]All the staff is just sitting here sad.
[205:47.98]Why?
[205:51.32]Somebody do something.
[205:54.42]What are you doing?
[205:59.12]He's like, I can't do it.
[206:00.54]I can't shoot the old man.
[206:05.50]Somebody do something.
[206:10.20]Ban the elderly!
[206:38.88]Oh, look at you.
[206:40.32]I wish you would give me more money than 265 fucking dollars.
[206:46.05]Everybody in this whole casino.
[206:48.03]I make 30 times more than every fucking person here.
[206:52.47]I want more money, though.
[206:56.95]Fine.
[207:18.79]Some stuff in here is older than me!
[207:29.78]And he was like, gyrating and like, thrusting.
[207:36.16]Because he lost him.
[207:38.06]Alright, which one was he on?
[207:41.09]Which one was he on?
[207:41.89]I'm curious.
[207:43.87]This one right here?
[207:48.15]Alright, so this one right here.
[207:49.83]Slot number four, low bet.
[207:51.83]Let's see.

[207:58.98]Or is that total?
[208:02.34]Where's profit today for it?
[208:03.50]Think I can go like this, right?
[208:06.24]Yeah.
[208:06.34]I don't know what his problem was.
[208:12.11]What was the problem?
[208:15.88]Oh, I think it was the next one.
[208:17.26]It was low bet 5.
[208:17.96]Mid and max bet are both 10.
[208:27.26]I can't change the bets.
[208:29.53]These are just 10, these are 50, and the other ones are 100.
[208:33.05]I don't think I can change it.
[208:35.65]X number 4.
[208:36.31]Well, hold on.
[208:36.79]I gotta wait for the police to get out.
[208:41.57]Where's the cheater, by the way?
[208:50.12]He put, he like, that was so fucking ridiculous.
[208:54.37]He's just thrusting around.
[208:56.27]The floor bounces, staring at him.
[208:58.29]Raises the gun, puts it down, raises the gun, puts it down, like the janitors are all just watching.
[209:05.43]What's gonna happen?
[209:07.89]Fire the doorman?
[209:10.09]Oh my god, fuck this guy, yeah.
[209:15.22]Yeah, the guy that's about to go down.
[209:36.69]He's going downstairs.
[209:37.71]Hey, bro.
[209:39.39]How are you?
[209:40.47]I'm doing pretty good.
[209:41.21]I'm doing pretty good, Jerry.
[209:42.65]Yeah, I know you're coming down here to kick the shit out of me with probably a tire iron.
[209:50.11]You know, let me think about giving me a little bit more money after this.
[209:53.45]You're going to have to talk to the boss.
[209:54.71]I've got nothing to fucking do with that.
[209:56.59]Yeah, well, I mean, I make 60 times your income, Bill, but... Okay, which side do you want to hit first?
[210:07.75]Oh!
[210:17.35]I quit.
[210:20.67]We quit.
[210:23.62]Morale is low.
[210:24.88]Staff are leaving.
[210:51.71]Police have reopened the floor.
[210:57.59]He's not going to come all the way down here and shoot him, right?
[211:12.35]The police are on their way to the casino.
[211:23.39]Oh, that's so fucking stupid.
[211:31.93]Oh, that's so fucked up.
[211:41.12]Okay, so... There you go.
[211:54.88]Alright, but I mean, like, the guy, the guy was getting paid.
[211:58.52]A hundred times, everybody else, and he kept asking for a pay raise.
[212:01.36]It's like, no, you're not gonna get a pay raise.
[212:03.02]And then he spit on the guy in the elevator.
[212:04.60]You didn't see that part.
[212:05.89]And he pushed him, and he shoved him into the wall, and the bouncer hit his head on the back of the fucking wall.
[212:18.27]Is he still hanging out down here?
[212:19.79]Garfield's kind of freaking me out.
[212:20.99]Alright, go back upstairs.
[212:32.54]What?
[212:33.02]Wait.
[212:34.66]Oh, there's a wizard convention.
[212:35.96]We've got to change some stuff.
[212:38.70]Anybody eat in here?
[212:42.78]$20.
[212:43.94]How much is a steak?
[212:48.82]Okay.
[212:49.45]So we've served two people.
[212:51.67]I've got to change this to... What are you doing in here?
[212:58.36]Uh, what do wizards like?
[212:59.78]I don't know, disco or something?
[213:07.33]Okay.
[213:15.28]Nice!
[213:16.80]How's the hotel doing?
[213:18.30]The hotel's doing fantastic, actually.
[213:20.70]I almost want to build another one.
[213:28.40]I could put a few pinball machines over here.
[213:29.82]No, I need money.
[213:30.36]I need money.
[213:34.30]Oh, right.
[213:34.64]My cheat.
[213:37.48]Okay.
[213:38.12]Acting normally at the Toy Box Casino.
[213:41.27]Oh, he's just winning.
[213:42.69]He's just playing and winning.
[213:45.43]Alright, it's time.
[213:46.01]Let's start cheating.
[213:48.17]There's a lot of Flora men down here.
[213:50.17]Go over here and cheat on this one.
[213:57.12]Alright, he's got a thousand bucks.
[214:29.10]Alright, good.
[214:31.60]You didn't get anything.
[214:35.06]How do you have a thousand dollars if you don't have anything?
[214:39.66]Why are there three Scooby... What's with the four Scooby Doo characters?
[214:43.82]What are they all doing?
[214:57.39]I want to sit at this poker table.
[215:00.59]Ugh, shit.
[215:03.33]Is there another floor here I can go down and... I gotta go up.
[215:09.14]Alright, up here.
[215:09.70]They have so many floor men, it's so hard to cheat here.
[215:12.06]Oh, pianist!
[215:16.86]It's so hard- wait, money wheel?!
[215:19.88]Uh, go play this.
[215:20.48]I just want you to play it.
[215:22.12]This place is awesome!
[215:41.88]Did we lose him?
[215:42.46]No, he's coming back.
[215:43.10]Good.
[215:56.61]I can't cheat here.
[215:58.01]There's no opportunity.
[215:58.89]I mean, I could try it.
[216:02.44]I could try it back here.
[216:04.14]No.
[216:04.70]It's just everywhere.
[216:05.24]I should start cheating in front of him.
[216:17.45]Should I be that ballsy?
[216:18.23]I mean, he's a five-star cheater.
[216:35.13]No, it's not worth it.
[216:35.75]It's not.
[216:36.41]It's not worth it.
[216:39.16]Alright, just go home.
[216:41.50]I'll take a thousand dollars.
[216:42.84]How much more do I need?
[216:46.66]Fuck, I need more money.
[216:53.03]Low jackpot frequency.
[216:54.71]Low percentage payout.
[216:56.37]High jackpot frequency, low payouts.
[217:04.15]Like, make them think that they're winning.
[217:21.38]This place is dead.
[217:23.54]I guess it happens when you kill a doorman, you shoot a rhino, and an old guy also dies.
[217:34.40]That's, I guess, what happens to your casino.
[217:37.52]You start losing money.
[217:41.26]Drunk rhino dies, old man belligerently punches through one of the screens and gets shot, and then we kill the doorman in the basement.
[217:49.62]Cool.
[217:53.71]I still haven't unlocked these yet.
[217:55.57]God damn it.
[217:56.22]Come on.
[217:56.66]I need that 44,000.
[217:57.06]What's the hotel doing?
[218:04.54]Hotel's the only thing keeping me afloat right now.
[218:08.18]I'm gonna have to... $55 a night.
[218:17.07]Give Garfield a raise.
[218:18.01]I already did.
[218:25.15]1465 bucks in profit.
[218:27.61]I mean, I'm still in the green.
[218:31.36]Not by very much, but I still am.
[218:32.70]I need to get a new property.
[218:35.38]I mean, I have to buy a new property.
[218:42.60]Where do I even buy a new property?
[218:53.86]Okay, real estate.
[218:57.10]We got, how many of these places are open?
[219:02.29]What's available?
[219:04.31]Cupcake Bakery.
[219:06.81]Snow's Pawn Brokers.
[219:08.73]These are all 200 grand.
[219:09.99]160, 160, 120.
[219:10.05]75, go all the way down.
[219:11.01]Alright, there's a Wasteland Casino.
[219:13.26]These are all 30,000.
[219:13.70]No.
[219:13.76]I don't have any money.
[219:26.55]Just buy a streamer house.
[219:29.45]With $11,000, I think you need to add a couple zeros.
[219:32.46]There you go.
[219:36.96]Play it.
[219:40.46]The bar is doing alright.
[219:44.72]I have some staff that I gotta get.
[219:46.80]We have a staff bloat problem.
[219:51.56]We got janitors standing around in circles.
[219:57.55]Let's take a look.
[219:58.17]What's the bloat here?
[219:58.85]We got dealers that aren't doing anything.
[220:00.31]We got janitors standing around.
[220:01.51]You're out.
[220:05.28]You're out.
[220:08.50]Oh, Garfield.
[220:11.40]Gotta keep you around.
[220:15.50]Okay, this floor man's been pretty good, actually.
[220:17.58]Been very, very, very, very, very good at sniffing out potential cheaters.
[220:23.24]This bouncer, I think, I believe, has been pretty good.
[220:28.50]There's only two, there's three bouncers.
[220:29.92]This one's gotta go.
[220:36.95]All the servers, where are you located?
[220:40.60]I think it's time.
[220:41.70]Yeah, we, it's time to liquidate these.
[220:43.98]Nobody, you know, nobody cares.
[220:45.06]Look at the profit on these.
[220:51.03]These have made a... I've been streaming for three and a half hours.
[220:54.49]These went up at least two... Nice.
[220:57.57]These went up probably two and a half hours ago.
[221:00.49]They've made $100.
[221:00.87]They've made less than $300, $400 total.
[221:02.03]It's time for them to go.
[221:03.01]Let's see.
[221:25.13]Where's the food?
[221:25.63]Food kiosks.
[221:29.65]Six fucking dollars.
[221:31.24]These things made four dollars.
[221:32.56]Yeah, goodbye.
[221:38.34]Make the prices reasonable?
[221:41.92]But no one's buying them.
[221:44.92]This shit is five bucks for a good quality hamburger.
[221:50.15]Fire at the cheetah casino again.
[221:54.53]I'm getting rid of them.
[221:55.09]I'm gonna put more slots in here.
[221:56.92]Food's upstairs.
[221:58.44]Yeah, you just bought one.
[221:59.10]Good.
[222:04.44]Yeah, that's it.
[222:04.82]We gotta get rid of them.
[222:07.60]Just make a crappy one.
[222:08.76]I'll make one.
[222:09.66]It's ice cream.
[222:11.06]It's the ice cream.
[222:12.88]It's gone.
[222:13.19]It's out for a hundred bucks?
[222:16.93]How much did I put this down for?
[222:18.79]This thing sucks!
[222:24.96]Yeah, but it's not about the profit.
[222:26.08]It's about no one is buying them.
[222:28.98]This shit is incredibly reasonable.
[222:32.33]Even if I did, like, $4, I mean, no one's purchasing these.
[222:37.91]And when I put the low quality, everyone started throwing up everywhere.
[222:52.28]I just watched five people.
[222:53.42]Yeah, five people just Bob for the bird.
[222:55.76]Do you see the numbers?
[222:57.04]This is the book.
[223:03.49]Look, let's just do food only.
[223:07.05]Look.
[223:08.68]The food kiosks.
[223:10.22]They don't do shit.
[223:11.84]They make 20 bucks a day.
[223:14.94]We're checking the numbers right now.
[223:16.96]As opposed to, for instance, like the movie theater.
[223:19.72]The porn theater makes three to six hundred plus dollars a day.
[223:24.40]The baccarat table loses a thousand dollars.
[223:26.76]Uh, well, just one day.
[223:28.74]Somebody probably cheated and I didn't kick them off the table.
[223:31.06]Uh, slot machine didn't do very well yet, but it's fine.
[223:33.06]Whatever.
[223:37.79]No food porn.
[223:39.91]It brings people in.
[223:40.59]That's how business works.
[223:42.43]Don't try to lecture me on fucking business, okay?
[223:45.48]Don't try to lecture me on business.
[223:49.48]I'm the guy that decided to make the expensive drinks only $3 more than my profit margin.
[223:54.10]That's business.
[223:54.66]I won.
[224:20.75]Ah, she's gone.
[224:24.59]I won.
[224:34.86]You're good.
[224:35.30]Alright.
[224:36.36]12,000.
[224:36.40]They're actually getting the... They're actually ordering drinks.
[224:41.08]I should probably get another bartender.
[224:42.24]Another bar, another bartender.
[224:46.10]I'm making money.
[224:46.74]Slowly.
[224:47.26]Slowly.
[224:49.49]What about another ring?
[224:51.19]Another row of slot machines?
[224:52.39]Slots, slots, right here.
[224:53.53]That's what I'm doing.
[224:55.05]The low ones.
[224:55.55]The small ones.
[224:56.11]The low bet ones.
[225:02.04]Why does this casino look like a TF2 trade server map?
[225:12.68]I don't... I don't know.
[225:13.82]Why?
[225:15.59]Oh, wait.
[225:15.95]That's the wrong way.
[225:43.29]People love these things!
[225:45.83]God dammit, they just- they- they just- okay, I'm filling the fucking casino with these.
[225:52.12]They- they go- people go nuts for these.
[226:06.83]I need a poker table.
[226:07.77]I need poker.
[226:10.41]Right here.
[226:13.23]Poker.
[226:13.61]This brings in people.
[226:15.35]Poker.
[226:16.73]Poker.
[226:18.39]Bang.
[226:18.93]I know it was five grand, but I need it.
[226:26.64]A good dealer.
[226:28.92]Five star dealer at poker.
[226:30.72]Let's go.
[226:31.12]This is going to bring in big money.
[226:36.80]Minimum bet, 100 fucking bucks.
[226:38.56]High roll of poker.
[226:47.18]I'm gonna drop the minimums on here, back to 10.
[226:49.82]Maximum 75.
[227:00.32]A dealer doesn't play poker?
[227:03.53]Right, whatever.
[227:04.33]It's just, man, it's a video game.
[227:08.68]Oh, all the technicians quit.
[227:10.66]That makes sense.
[227:11.44]Okay.
[227:11.56]Here we go.
[227:23.95]Oh, you're a floor man.
[227:29.05]Roulette's doing real well.
[227:31.09]Blackjack's picking back up again.
[227:34.66]Old lady playing poker?
[227:44.34]Fine.
[227:46.82]Look, they're having, like, fun over here.
[227:47.96]9,200 negative.
[227:51.30]Fuck, I keep spending money.
[227:52.48]I keep spending money.
[227:53.75]I gotta stop spending money.
[227:54.71]I just gotta... Alright, I gotta stop spending money.
[227:58.17]I gotta let the casino do what it's supposed to do and make money.
[228:01.71]Are you cheating here?
[228:02.63]No, you're just playing here.
[228:03.67]Why are you playing here?
[228:04.83]Wait, you are cheating here.
[228:07.37]Are you cheating here?
[228:11.45]Ludo.
[228:12.43]You're... Ludo.
[228:14.64]Don't... Don't make me do this.
[228:19.32]This thing's negative 17.
[228:20.56]He's cheating here.
[228:22.06]Just check.
[228:22.62]I'm not going to point fingers yet.
[228:23.98]Where's my floor manager?
[228:28.30]Can you check on him for just a second?
[228:29.79]Please.
[228:30.21]Please.
[228:30.75]Ludo, please.
[228:36.07]Ludo.
[228:36.39]Ludo.
[228:50.69]Not Ludo.
[228:53.32]No.
[228:54.18]Negative.
[228:54.98]Oh, no.
[228:56.20]It's not.
[228:57.36]Oh, no.
[229:03.33]Don't take anymore.
[229:04.21]Don't take anymore.
[229:36.90]What are you doing to me?
[229:40.46]Stop!
[229:47.31]Oh my god.
[229:48.01]Alright, kick his ass.
[229:48.69]Beat him up.
[229:49.35]He's obviously cheating.
[229:51.25]I have to.
[229:51.81]We have to stop him.
[229:53.15]I'm gonna be the negative.
[229:53.87]I'm negative.
[229:54.41]I'm negative.
[229:54.99]He has to die.
[229:55.83]Like, right now.
[229:58.03]I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt.
[229:59.17]Give me that money back.
[230:06.44]Did he forget what he was supposed to be doing?
[230:08.20]He's supposed to be... He's acting innocent.
[230:12.00]In my casino.
[230:13.66]He works for me.
[230:15.34]You don't have to act innocent on my property.
[230:17.30]Why would you act innocent and you just bleed one of my machines $4,000?
[230:20.48]That's unbelievable.
[230:23.54]Give me this money back now.
[230:24.30]That's bullshit.
[230:30.47]Oh, I'm not going to execute him.
[230:33.97]He just took like five.
[230:34.87]Look at this.
[230:36.30]Can you tell me that there's not an abnormality here?
[230:37.46]4,100.
[230:37.48]Negative 3,500.
[230:37.72]2,300.
[230:37.74]What do you got to hide?
[230:38.46]Pass up.
[230:39.18]What have you been up to?
[230:41.54]The visitor you just beat up denied it.
[231:11.86]Get over here, get over here, get over here.
[231:15.06]Garfield!
[231:39.04]The visitor you just beat up denied it.
[231:57.65]The police are on their way to the casino.
[232:00.71]Oh, hey!
[232:01.83]By the way, Bouncer, you ever see that movie?
[232:03.65]Oh, no.

[232:24.09]This is not like a fucking casino.
[232:26.01]I'm a fucking casino operator.
[232:28.01]Back in the fucking 70s, we did all that shit in the basement.
[232:31.49]We beat people up and we shot them.
[232:33.61]That's not... I'm not doing that.
[232:35.05]I... Stop this.
[232:38.48]I'm bleeding money.
[232:40.04]I'm bleeding fucking money.
[232:44.92]No, this is not a fucking movie from the 70s, okay?
[232:46.84]I'm not doing that anymore.
[232:48.06]I'm running my establishment.
[232:49.02]I'm gonna be bleeding money again.

[262:29.30]Wait a minute.
[262:31.94]Why the two of you?
[262:34.30]When did I hire a second person?
[262:47.34]Mr. Chubb.
[262:47.60]Go on.
[262:47.76]I'm forever stuck at $10,000.
[262:48.36]I'll never make it out.
[262:51.51]You got ejected.
[262:52.49]Well, at least somebody took money.
[263:16.70]Alright, I think I'm gonna try that strategy.
[263:18.96]Trailer trash only.
[263:20.77]And have the bar hire another bartender, make drinks cheap, and make them a dollop.
[263:33.28]Need a bouncer?
[263:33.88]Yep, I'll get a bouncer.
[263:34.66]Look it, my money's already increasing.
[263:41.02]Two bouncers.
[263:41.82]That's all I need down here on the bottom floor.
[263:44.36]How's the hotel doing?
[263:45.44]Just... it's so much money.
[263:47.24]Okay.
[263:51.33]Just buy more money.
[264:05.89]Money, money, money, money.
[264:07.21]Let's go.
[264:07.85]Nobody's going here.
[264:10.51]Serve people, serve people.
[264:11.79]We need more patrons.
[264:13.03]We need more people.
[264:14.44]Oh, who's up here?
[264:15.08]The chef is just cooking food for nothing.
[264:19.28]For nobody.
[264:22.62]There's no one up here.
[264:23.62]There's nobody even working at the bowling alley.
[264:43.73]We just need one waiter up here.
[264:51.49]Almost at 13.
[264:53.41]13-5.
[264:54.43]Good.
[265:08.79]Second bartender.
[265:09.51]You know what?
[265:11.57]Yeah.
[265:12.43]Yeah.
[265:12.77]Second bartender, I think.
[265:17.80]Level 3 bartender.
[265:19.28]Two of them here.
[265:20.88]Let the alcohol flow.
[265:23.95]Medium drinks.
[265:26.03]Six bucks a pop.
[265:27.57]Here we go.
[265:28.21]Come on.
[265:35.81]Just get me to 44,000.
[265:38.51]No more spending.
[265:39.59]No more attacking.
[265:43.05]1,500.
[265:43.33]More bucks.
[265:44.77]This is a cheater right here.
[265:45.93]That's my cheat.
[265:46.99]Okay, good.
[265:48.81]Go cheat at the toy box.
[265:54.03]I want 2,000 this time.
[265:56.00]Get on it.
[265:58.46]You have $450 in your pocket?
[266:00.02]Good.
[266:00.54]I'll take it.
[266:07.70]Okay, we got the bowling alley set up.
[266:09.14]Everything's good to go.
[266:10.00]How cheap?
[266:10.46]Let's make everything cheap.
[266:14.42]12 bucks to bowl.
[266:17.82]This, this, I'm not going to change this.
[266:19.18]This is doing really, really well.
[266:24.40]Get a janitor on that second floor.
[266:27.16]Wasn't there a janitor?
[266:27.76]Was the janitor just up here?
[266:31.09]Alright.
[266:32.13]Back to adult movies.
[266:33.07]No, no, no.
[266:33.41]We've had, people are getting sick of the adult movies.
[266:35.35]It's the same adult movie over and over again.
[266:47.17]Like, you can't... You gotta move on.
[266:48.29]You gotta... You can't... You can't watch the same movie more than, like, five times.
[267:05.04]Good.
[267:07.60]Stop betting.
[267:10.41]Let's put that at 25.
[267:11.11]How much is food here?
[267:15.81]Ten bucks.
[267:16.77]Let's make it expensive and make it $20 a plate.
[267:20.99]At least maybe one or two rich people will come up here and eat this.
[267:25.61]Come on.
[267:28.41]We need people.
[267:31.02]It's almost like, um, when your potential hazard for people to come here, and people, nobody, nobody shows up!
[267:37.64]Has something to do with it, probably.
[267:41.42]Yeah, I hear that they, I hear they execute their doormen in the basement.
[267:45.71]We're going somewhere else!
[268:04.49]These did okay.
[268:15.96]Ow!
[268:17.66]That fucking hurt.
[268:19.92]I promise that hurt you more than it hurt me, but still hurt.
[268:26.32]What, did you just knock somebody out?
[268:36.81]Who is this?
[268:44.65]You just blasted somebody.
[268:46.55]The party never stops.
[268:59.72]The party never stops.
[269:01.24]Wait, what?
[269:10.99]Where are you going?
[269:11.55]Wait, I attacked the waiter?
[269:15.78]No, no, that's not what I was supposed to do.
[269:17.76]4900 in profits!
[269:19.00]Discipline!
[269:19.34]Stop!
[269:19.76]Stop, stop, stop.
[269:21.22]Go back to work.
[269:23.22]You're fine.
[269:41.25]Oh, I think he's stuck.
[269:44.60]There we are.
[269:45.24]Alright.
[269:54.09]No witnesses?
[269:57.13]No, he's not... It's not a witness.
[269:58.55]He works here.
[269:59.17]Oh, this too?
[270:04.75]What is the... These gas cylinders are freaking me out.
[270:13.00]Wait, are we... Holy shit!
[270:18.30]Okay, that was fucking nuts.
[270:33.32]Who wants to quit?
[270:35.13]You can't quit.
[270:36.77]You can't quit.
[270:37.45]You can't quit.
[270:40.39]This janitor wants to quit.
[270:44.09]You mean the janitor that's staring at a literal wall?
[270:48.04]No joking?
[270:48.70]Like, oh, what are you doing?
[270:49.40]Staring at the wall?
[270:50.54]He's staring at a wall.
[270:52.94]Bye.
[270:59.95]Where are you?
[271:01.09]We only need one janitor anyways.
[271:02.31]Eye roller.
[271:07.43]Stop blowing money here.
[271:15.36]Come on, blow big money.
[271:16.16]Yep.
[271:16.32]Good.
[271:16.96]Yeah, good to check on a guy like this, right?
[271:23.41]I mean, just checking to make sure he's not cheating.
[271:29.05]He's losing a lot of money.
[271:29.81]This is good.
[271:36.96]And the mummies really love the slot machines.
[271:42.82]These are doing really well.
[271:52.75]We're climbing.
[271:54.91]We're increasing in money right here.
[271:56.09]We're doing fine.
[272:00.03]Backer at table, I think, has to go.
[272:01.40]There's too many staff and nobody cares.
[272:05.30]Are you going to sit at the backer at table?
[272:06.76]If not, then it's going to go.
[272:15.57]It's got to go.
[272:16.67]No one's playing it.
[272:26.98]Is he playing?
[272:31.22]He's playing, he's playing, he's playing.
[272:41.75]Okay.
[272:42.33]Okay, this guy's gonna lose money.
[272:43.91]Good.
[272:44.07]18,000.
[272:45.98]We're getting there.
[272:50.88]Oh, the hotel rooms.
[272:51.62]Look at this hotel.
[272:52.32]Should I do 60 bucks a night?
[272:59.73]Speed up time.
[273:04.27]Oh my god, that's too fast.
[273:05.45]Build another hotel?
[273:11.61]I don't have the money.
[273:12.47]I need 30 grand.
[273:15.55]Get a carpet that doesn't look like this.
[273:19.41]I can't.
[273:19.99]I can't afford it.
[273:20.59]I need to level up again.
[273:36.03]I'll get there.
[273:36.51]I'm almost at 20.
[273:37.14]Okay, these are not negative, which is fine.
[273:47.96]You're still serving customers.
[273:49.20]This cattle high roller.
[273:52.39]Another wall.
[273:53.83]Where's Everett?
[274:00.17]At least pretend like you're working, you know?
[274:05.60]Just pretend like you're working.
[274:06.86]I don't care.
[274:07.40]As long as you look like you're doing something.
[274:09.02]Okay, 19,820.
[274:27.97]Good.
[274:28.15]And here we go.
[274:40.42]That's good for me.
[274:45.12]Everything's nice and clean.
[274:46.02]Everything's running well.
[275:00.87]God damn it.
[275:03.57]Can I get a drink, please?
[275:04.71]Can I get a drink, please?
[275:07.54]Roulette.
[275:08.66]This table's dead.
[275:09.70]It's out.
[275:10.74]One guy played it and lost 100 bucks.
[275:12.70]It's gone.
[275:13.40]Actually, actually, actually being sold.
[275:15.71]And the dealers are gone too.
[275:16.59]I think that's it.
[275:18.61]Like, Blair.
[275:20.49]Okay, we have Ricketts, Mason, and Groft.
[275:24.57]All of them gone.
[275:32.52]Okay, good.
[275:32.98]It's the end of the day.
[275:34.44]Wages have been paid.
[275:44.77]Sorry, everybody.
[275:46.55]Everybody gets $5.
[275:47.21]Fine.
[275:55.56]Everybody gets $10.
[275:56.06]Fine.
[275:59.06]You two get a $5 salary increase.
[276:02.50]Good.
[276:04.44]There we go.
[276:04.98]Now I'm not losing just bleeding money.
[276:09.00]It's too loud for me.
[276:19.40]I need walls.
[276:23.06]That's why.
[276:23.38]There needs to be a wall here.
[276:25.42]Like, here and here.
[276:28.19]That's the problem.
[276:32.01]Okay.
[276:33.85]Yes.
[276:34.81]Yup.
[276:35.77]We have to make walls.
[277:23.24]Shit.
[277:23.68]This is bad.
[277:24.10]Okay.
[277:24.36]Is that going to mitigate some of the sound?
[277:37.82]Why is the place so ugly?
[277:38.78]I don't know.
[277:39.70]This place is all stupid.
[277:44.17]What do you want me to do?
[277:45.41]I didn't plan with walls.
[277:48.16]Separate them by floors.
[277:49.76]Right, only slots.
[277:50.98]Yes, yes, you're right, you're right.
[277:52.62]But I put bowling alleys upstairs.
[277:55.62]And I put a porn theater and a restaurant that no one goes to.
[277:59.39]Nobody eats here.
[278:01.53]I have a delicious five-star restaurant up here that nobody wants to eat at.
[278:06.01]Might as well make it fucking burgers and fries and that's at three dollars a meal.
[278:13.92]We got Dennis Kirby, one of the most talented chefs in all of
[278:19.77]What's the name of this place?
[278:22.27]Slammin' Slots and Lanes.
[278:35.43]Would you eat in the porn restaurant?
[278:36.81]Yes.
[278:38.17]Of course I would.
[278:41.61]And people use this shit.
[278:42.93]People like this shit stuff up here.
[278:48.61]This actually has made some money.
[278:58.88]This whole floor is worth, like, let's say 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[279:01.94]I mean, this whole, this floor has made, like, 25 plus thousand dollars.
[279:21.92]You put a restaurant on the hooker floor.
[279:31.83]Why am I losing money again?
[279:32.89]Alright, lady.
[279:38.26]I've had enough of you saying that.
[279:40.52]So... It's time for you to leave.
[279:42.86]Pay attention.
[279:59.68]What?

[280:09.31]Why would you fuke for that?
[280:11.47]Why would you fuke?
[280:15.69]I don't care.
[280:16.47]I'm busy.
[280:17.11]Just wait.
[280:24.79]There's somebody on this one.
[280:26.13]And they're losing money.
[280:32.81]Wait, somebody's still fighting you?
[280:34.19]Wait, is he going in for round two?
[280:41.58]That lady just one hit knocked him out, and now he's going for round two.
[280:48.92]Oh, no, he's just losing money.
[280:51.96]Imagine getting fucking knocked out and coming and losing five grand at the poker table.
[281:19.54]Come on.
[281:20.40]I gotta move this in a better spot.
[281:26.06]But it's too loud up here for us old people.

[281:35.43]No, I don't think so.
[281:47.24]Where do I put this?
[281:48.02]I'm just going to delete this shit.
[281:49.64]There's no reason for it to be over here.
[281:59.80]Maybe I could go like bang, bang, bang.
[282:01.82]Yeah, let's do that.
[282:03.84]Put it down here for now.
[282:05.80]Move this out of the way.
[282:10.32]It's okay.
[282:10.64]They're idiots.

[288:17.33]Why is the fucking casino on fire again?
[288:20.99]What is going on?
[288:27.40]Yep.
[288:34.77]Dennis Kirby, ladies and gentlemen, a three star, one of the most pop-starred chefs in all of Slammin' Jammin' Slots.
[288:43.95]Oh-ha!
[288:44.97]And you're gonna cost me, you're gonna cost me a lot of money here, Kirby.
[288:50.82]Yeah, great.
[288:53.90]He's outside.
[288:54.52]He's doing just, he's out here.
[288:58.76]We're at the fucking place where the ground just decides to, he's just hanging out, that's okay.
[289:24.77]What?!
[289:29.80]How is the ground floor- the floor two as- Where's the fire down here?

[289:41.05]Okay, some- I need a fire department in here.
[289:42.71]I- I'm fucking actually- I'm mad right now.
[290:10.25]Where's Kirby?
[290:21.43]Look at everybody.
[290:22.67]Everybody's leaving.
[290:23.57]They're going to the other casino.
[290:27.53]All because of a shitty restaurant that nobody went to.
[290:36.93]I was on pace to have $44,000.
[290:46.55]Oh my god.
[290:53.34]Where's the chef?
[290:54.36]Where is he?
[290:58.18]He's still outside.
[290:58.82]Is he running away?
[291:01.78]This motherfucker's running away.
[291:20.96]Alright, I need to know what this is.
[291:25.25]He's coming down the street.
[291:25.96]Through where the department store is.
[292:13.46]I can't attack him outside.
[292:14.78]Alright, give me $44,000!
[292:19.60]Breeze!
[292:24.68]Go!
[292:25.08]Back to work, everybody!

[292:36.65]The basement.
[292:38.25]You know what?
[292:39.33]Stay here.
[292:41.81]Stay down there.
[292:55.06]26,000.
[292:55.16]I'm almost there.
[292:56.46]I need another, like, 10 grand.
[292:58.54]This is alright.
[292:59.30]This is looking good.
[293:00.08]This is what I want it to be like.
[293:05.45]Oh, fuck the beanbag chair.
[293:06.69]So I'm just keeping it.
[293:17.35]That looks a little more clean.
[293:19.13]Oh, it looks nice and clean.
[293:20.27]I made 800 bucks.
[293:22.83]Considering my casino almost burnt down.
[293:34.48]Why did I just lose money?
[293:35.28]What's going on?
[293:35.86]Somebody's stealing.
[293:39.37]What are you up to?
[293:39.83]Yep.
[293:42.83]I knew it.
[293:51.78]Just throw her out.
[293:52.58]I don't even want the money.
[293:53.46]And go.
[293:53.86]Come on.
[294:01.71]Come on.
[294:02.47]30,000.
[294:04.13]30,000.
[294:04.45]30,000.
[294:04.75]30,000.
[294:04.77]30,000.
[294:04.79]30,000.
[294:04.81]30,000. 30,000.
[294:20.64]I'm just stuck at 26,000.
[294:23.50]Change the decor?
[294:24.34]I don't think I have... It's not available for me to do that.
[294:27.12]I probably have to level up.
[294:29.76]I have to do this.
[294:30.14]I have to get to $44,000.
[294:30.56]Poker's doing really well.
[294:51.97]$27,000.
[294:52.61]Good.
[294:54.11]$10,000.
[294:54.49]Just look around.
[294:55.09]$13,000.
[294:59.21]Nothing suspicious is going on.
[295:05.98]Okay.
[295:06.14]$27,000.
[295:06.28]Get it up.
[295:13.20]That's not us.
[295:15.94]Okay.
[295:19.02]Floor man?
[295:23.12]What's with the fighting?
[295:25.69]Wait, the milkman versus a teen?
[295:28.81]Why are you in a... Wait, all these are the... There's like a navy convention or something, right?
[295:36.44]Because there's cheap drinks.
[295:38.90]Oh shit, that's right.
[295:39.82]Might as well make them even cheaper.
[295:43.42]The convention has now finished.
[295:45.50]You are the one for me.
[295:51.08]28.
[295:51.10]Gotta get to 44,000.
[295:51.52]2,000 visitors.
[295:58.21]Do I get money for that?
[295:59.75]I don't.
[296:04.89]Come on, let's go.
[296:05.61]No cheaters.
[296:05.91]30,000.
[296:05.93]I need to be at 44 for one day.
[296:23.89]I think another... Get rid of the blackjack table, another poker table after this.
[296:34.04]How's upstairs looking?
[296:38.78]What an absolute fucking monumental waste of time.
[296:42.79]Sell it.
[296:43.33]Sell it all.
[296:44.41]I'll do it again later.
[296:45.93]I can't... Make a small kitchen with the hamburgers or something.
[296:50.83]It's the end of the day.
[296:52.29]Wages have been paid.
[296:59.52]I can turn this into something else.
[297:00.68]I can't sell the hooker.
[297:02.70]Okay.
[297:04.08]I gotta put something over here eventually.
[297:06.14]It's not making any money.
[297:06.82]It's just losing money.
[297:08.32]Screwed up.
[297:08.58]This is still making money.
[297:10.38]This is still making money.
[297:14.14]Come on.
[297:16.78]That uptick needs to keep going. 30.
[297:22.20]I'm gonna start charging more money for shit.
[297:23.48]I think we have to sacrifice the dance floor.
[297:33.00]I expanded too quickly.
[297:39.92]Don't ever sell... Don't ever sell the dance floor.
[298:01.19]I need to charge more money for this shit.
[298:05.71]Go back to adults.
[298:06.91]Adults only.
[298:07.87]Horn.
[298:09.87]Back downstairs.
[298:10.43]I'm gonna do... Low quality food.
[298:16.66]Eight bucks.
[298:19.20]Low quality.
[298:20.56]Seven bucks.
[298:23.26]Okay.
[298:24.96]The drinks are gonna be cheap as shit.
[298:26.76]That's fine.
[298:35.78]and let's go come on grow grow grow grow grow grow grow growth growth growth growth growth growth growth
[298:54.59]Why did somebody just say Trump Steaks?
[298:57.39]I'm here with Trump Steaks.
[298:58.63]They're the best steaks that you've ever had in your life.
[299:02.05]Delicious prime country meat.
[299:04.70]Come on, let's go!
[299:10.64]I'll deliver it right to the front door.
[299:12.84]Your beautiful front door.
[299:13.82]It's a big door.
[299:18.38]Fight!
[299:19.26]Oh, get her!
[299:20.68]Come on!
[299:21.60]Come on, Malkowski!
[299:24.08]Hit her with the cane.
[299:24.76]Wait, why are you attacking them?
[299:30.18]Whoa!
[299:31.76]What the?
[299:32.88]Easy.
[299:33.88]Why are you... Holy shit, this lady is unbeatable.
[299:40.57]Why are they all fucking punching each other?
[299:48.05]That lady was almost unbeatable.
[299:53.55]Casito Rumble.
[299:58.77]34,000.
[299:58.99]Skip!
[300:04.80]There's a convention starting soon.
[300:06.30]Martial arts convention.
[300:07.44]Good.
[300:07.86]Maybe it'll put me over right at the edge here.
[300:10.78]Almost at 44,000.
[300:11.18]An attraction has been damaged.
[300:27.15]Where?
[300:28.65]Whatever.
[300:33.51]Which one's damaged?
[300:34.40]Who damaged it?
[300:39.36]Back here?
[300:41.64]Oh, somebody did damage it.
[300:42.76]No, I didn't catch him.
[300:45.44]We need a casino tournament arc.
[300:48.54]God.
[300:49.67]You know what to do.
[301:00.27]Take a break.
[301:00.97]It's been five hours.
[301:01.75]Yeah, we're probably going to end very shortly here.
[301:08.74]I feel like I want to play this tomorrow.
[301:11.08]At least a little bit.
[301:12.06]I want to see the other stuff.
[301:19.99]Tomorrow's supposed to be the dumb movie night.
[301:25.82]But I think I want to see some more, at least another couple hours of this.
[301:29.50]Maybe we'll do this and then watch the movie.
[301:32.20]That would make sense, right?
[301:39.55]Play this for another couple hours and then do a movie?
[301:45.88]Yeah, we'll pick the movie tomorrow.
[301:49.86]But I'm going to play this tomorrow when we start.
[301:52.80]I thought that just said 54 people died today here.
[301:55.52]I was like, holy shit, what?
[301:58.56]It's the end of the day.
[302:00.02]Wages have been paid.
[302:05.03]I need that money.
[302:06.61]Come on, I'm just like skipping time.
[302:08.33]I could be spending this.
[302:13.07]An attraction has been damaged.
[302:14.87]Come on, I don't care.
[302:16.27]We just need the extra money.
[302:17.45]We need the extra attractions.
[302:20.35]Don't get them.
[302:20.85]39. 39.
[302:25.66]Your casino is being raided by the police.
[302:27.94]What?
[302:28.22]Everyone's scattering.
[302:40.04]I wish they would keep the noise down.
[302:42.45]No, I don't need this right now.
[302:44.05]I was already having trouble with patrons.
[302:48.25]Watch this be like a $30,000 fine.
[302:49.19]I would shit my pants.
[302:53.49]Everybody's leaving.
[302:54.23]I'm gonna be bleeding money.
[302:56.01]I was so close.
[303:01.37]Oh my god.
[303:09.69]Floor 2 has been reported to the police.
[303:14.35]Oh yeah, has it now?
[303:15.95]That's- isn't that just great?
[303:19.75]Oh my fucking god.
[303:29.83]I can't believe this shit.
[303:31.41]Come on.
[303:32.03]These poor DJs just here spinning records with nobody here.
[303:38.04]Ugh.
[303:59.51]The sacrifices need to be made.
[304:00.57]Alright, let's go!
[304:16.94]Alright, this... I don't want... Let's not go too fast.
[304:25.92]What happened?
[304:26.32]I sold the dance floor.
[304:28.54]Because it was $5,000 or $6,000 that I could get.
[304:34.53]I need that... I need more people to come back.
[304:36.75]I need... I have to buy an ad campaign.
[304:39.64]I have to.
[304:40.38]Otherwise, there's going to be like three people in here.
[304:41.90]One of them's a hooker.
[304:42.50]I have to buy an ad campaign.
[304:47.12]A good one.
[305:00.13]Just buy him up.
[305:01.09]Good.
[305:03.01]Okay.
[305:03.35]Now let it roll.
[305:08.45]We got plenty of staff.
[305:09.55]We got plenty of food.
[305:10.43]We're good to go.
[305:11.09]We got our slots all taken care of.
[305:14.45]Get rid of the cheat.
[305:17.39]Are you chasing our dealer around?
[305:19.48]Wait, why is this like some weird... What is happening?
[305:31.28]Just chasing the dealer around.
[305:33.42]Stop.
[305:34.62]Are you gonna actually knock out Garfield?
[305:37.55]There's no way.
[305:39.47]I can't believe you're gonna actually fucking knock out Garfield.
[305:41.63]Did you?
[305:42.63]You gotta be shitting me.
[305:43.49]She's breaking shit.
[305:54.20]It's her.
[305:54.60]Damn it.
[305:59.77]Get rid of her.
[306:00.51]Get rid of her.
[306:00.87]She's attacking.
[306:01.85]She had to do something.
[306:03.09]She's smashing stuff.
[306:04.93]Garfield.
[306:06.77]Where's Garfield?
[306:07.29]Get up.
[306:08.89]Okay, I... This has to end right now.
[306:12.03]I need a... Just... Mr. Deering?
[306:17.07]Mr. Deering.
[306:18.75]Shoot this person.
[306:19.53]No!
[306:26.26]You missed!
[306:27.50]You one star!
[306:29.28]You one star!
[306:32.02]Unbelievable!
[306:33.79]One star!
[306:35.09]One star!
[306:40.89]You're fucking fired!
[306:43.13]Oh my god!
[306:44.01]I'm never... You're fired!
[306:45.61]You're fired!
[306:46.21]Get out of here!
[306:46.71]You're fired!
[306:47.25]I'm so mad right now!
[306:49.19]I need this money!
[306:56.26]No!
[306:57.60]I'm so fucking mad.
[306:59.12]How did I kill the- I didn't kill the wrong person.
[307:03.37]He did.
[307:03.81]I selected that person that was breaking stuff and beating people up and he missed.
[307:10.78]Garfield, don't quit!
[307:13.96]Here's fucking $50!
[307:14.72]How much money do you want, Garfield?
[307:19.52]Garfield, I know you got, like, beat up by some lady.
[307:22.44]What?
[307:22.70]He's so happy!
[307:23.48]Alright, everybody!
[307:26.38]Everybody relax, everybody's gonna get a $30-$20 raise!
[307:29.38]That's a big fucking deal!
[307:41.03]Here!
[307:44.09]Okay?
[308:00.08]God damn it!
[308:04.52]Am I gonna get fined?
[308:07.19]I'm not going to get fined, right?
[308:08.47]For having too many fights.
[308:09.51]That's not my fault.
[308:10.31]That's the fault of, uh... $3... drinks.
[308:20.23]Nice job, Garfield.
[308:27.94]You got, like... Street Fighter comboed over here.
[308:33.12]And then I had to hire another guard because you got knocked the fuck out.
[308:39.65]I'm not happy with you, Garfield.
[308:40.95]That was bad.
[308:41.57]That was really bad.
[308:47.53]We need to get to 44,000.
[308:48.49]I'm not turning this stream off until I get there.
[308:53.28]Staff are unhappy and threatening to quit.
[309:07.87]She just... No, you can't trust me.
[309:18.86]Who's causing a disturbance?
[309:21.08]Will one of the police officers fucking go do something about it?
[309:23.96]Um, are we just not gonna have a police officer do anything?
[309:40.17]Do something about it.
[309:41.03]This guy's threatening to quit.
[309:45.14]Oh my god.
[310:24.81]$20,000 in fines in the last 15 minutes.
[310:28.73]That's unbelievable.
[310:30.49]What?
[310:33.33]What the fuck?
[310:53.72]You're sending people deliberately to cause problems.
[310:58.60]That's that.
[310:59.40]How do I get that?
[311:01.68]I would just hire 100 people just to go cause problems.
[311:07.52]It worked.
[311:08.02]Yeah, it did.
[311:09.37]Thank you.
[311:11.15]Okay.
[311:13.11]Good thing my ad campaign started.
[311:19.85]Let's go ahead and...
[311:25.00]Let's make this a little better.
[311:27.42]So it's not just... Ugh.
[311:29.86]God.
[311:32.42]$22,000.
[311:32.70]And it's empty.
[311:37.03]We are empty.
[311:38.97]It's just staff.
[311:41.29]There ain't nobody here.
[311:43.05]Nobody's here.
[311:45.59]Your empire is crumbling.
[311:46.89]Oh no, all because you murdered Ludo.
[311:49.02]It's true.
[311:51.02]It's true.
[311:54.85]What you're saying is accurate.
[311:57.77]He brought thousands of dollars into this company.
[312:03.61]I need some customers.
[312:04.70]13 people visited today.
[312:10.50]Oh my god, this is bad.
[312:12.08]This is bad.
[312:13.58]This is bad.
[312:13.82]Okay, customers coming on in.
[312:26.19]Come on.
[312:33.49]Nobody wants to come to the casino anymore.
[312:36.72]It's over.
[312:39.00]It's over.
[312:40.66]They all don't like this place.
[312:41.98]Nobody likes it here.
[312:50.14]My ad campaigns.
[312:51.70]Nooo.
[312:54.08]No, it's a disc.
[312:55.42]We're gonna have to close our doors.
[312:56.94]Ferris Wright, the last patron.
[313:01.84]The last guy here.
[313:14.48]Alright, now just watch this.
[313:15.92]Damn it.
[313:26.35]See if we can get any more customers.
[313:27.63]I might have to just go nuts for ad campaigns.
[313:34.57]Kick out the hookers.
[313:37.74]There's too many of them.
[313:41.00]When I get rid of one, another one appears.
[313:47.28]Porn theater's still good.
[313:48.44]Okay, now get rid of you.
[313:55.31]I might have to just go absolute nuts.
[313:57.77]We're gonna have to let in, uh, we're gonna have to let in teenagers.
[314:01.65]And just open it up and not serve alcohol.
[314:06.40]I need more pa- I need people to come to the place!
[314:10.76]I'm gonna turn off the porn theater, we're gonna stop serving alcohol, I'm gonna add a couple of arcade machines, and I'm gonna let teenagers come in.
[314:16.98]We're gonna change our image.
[314:23.52]Nope.
[314:25.00]Desperate times call for absolute desperate measures.
[314:34.07]This is a Chuck E. Cheese.
[314:39.71]I can turn it into a Chuck E. Cheese.
[314:41.47]I think that's the only way.
[314:44.95]They've been banned from the casino the whole time.
[314:46.61]Now what if I remove the bar and just... We're gonna turn it into a Chuck E. Cheese right now.
[314:54.81]Save it right here just in case it's a bad idea.
[314:56.35]I'm going for it.
[314:58.12]Check this out.
[314:58.74]We're gonna save this company.
[315:01.99]I'm gonna save this company right now.
[315:28.57]We'll keep these.
[315:29.51]Those are okay.
[315:37.55]Keep the restaurant.
[315:42.21]It's the end of the day.
[315:43.69]Wages have been paid.
[315:45.79]Okay.
[315:45.95]Get rid of the bar.
[315:46.95]The bar is gone.
[315:47.54]The little slot machine play is alright for the adult.
[315:51.04]No, it's not.
[315:55.62]I'm turning this into a fucking Chuck E. Cheese right now.
[316:03.54]Oh, by the way, I have $44,000.
[316:04.20]I win.
[316:04.40]What's this chef doing here?
[316:31.24]What is the chef doing here?
[316:33.17]Kirby, the chef?
[316:56.48]There's a convention starting soon.
[316:58.24]A clown convention!
[316:59.88]No, don't shoot anybody.
[317:00.94]There's a clown convention coming.
[317:01.98]I gotta make sure it's ready.
[317:02.72]I gotta make sure the Chuck E. Cheese is ready for the clowns.
[317:09.57]Okay, he's not coming down, right?
[317:11.45]I called off the hit, right?
[317:13.71]I called off the hit.
[317:15.05]I called off the hit.
[317:16.89]I called off the hit.
[317:18.77]I called off the hit.
[317:20.89]I called off the hit.
[317:21.71]I called off the hit.
[317:22.39]No, we have to get rid of the...
[317:25.09]Do not shoot him!
[317:26.85]Do not shoot him.
[317:29.78]Thank you.
[317:31.82]Don't shoot him.
[317:33.10]Don't do it.
[317:34.12]Put the gun down.
[317:35.24]Put down the gun.
[317:36.68]Do not fire that gun.
[317:38.82]Do not fire that gun.
[317:42.48]Go upstairs.
[317:44.87]Go upstairs now, please.
[317:47.29]Up here.
[317:49.79]Put the gun away.
[317:51.15]Thank you.
[317:51.63]Okay.
[317:51.99]I'll get rid of the fucking clown convention.

[322:30.09]Who is this person?
[322:33.21]Who is this?
[322:40.68]Somebody just came down here.
[322:41.90]Wait, where are you?
[322:56.28]They shut the door.
[323:06.69]How much is it for a new casino?
[323:08.63]$30,000, right?
[323:31.00]The police are on their way to the casino.
[323:32.60]Fuck.
[323:37.22]What?
[323:38.06]I didn't... Who are these firefighters?
[323:40.80]No, no, this isn't GTA, man.
[323:44.18]This is not GTA.
[323:59.78]What happened to the clowns?
[324:00.84]Where are the clowns?
[324:04.52]There was a clown college that was coming in.
[324:06.35]Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
[324:14.99]Oh my god.
[324:21.41]I'm sorry, I so badly just wanted to kill that chef.
[324:23.73]That chef just fucked it all up for me.
[324:26.71]We were on a trajectory of growth, and that guy burnt the casino down twice.
[324:33.27]So, I mean, he did it back to back.
[324:35.31]And he ruined everything.
[324:37.33]So the second I had the opportunity, you gotta give me a hitman, and it's an old guy with a gun downstairs in the basement.
[324:41.59]You don't think I'm gonna get, you don't think I'm gonna eliminate the chef down there?
[324:45.77]And then, I mean, the, I did, I planned, that was not, the second part of that wasn't supposed to happen.
[324:55.38]We have it saved for the clowns to come in.
[324:57.40]We're going to continue tomorrow.
[325:01.70]Oh, this game is hysterical.
[325:06.53]What an absolute mess of a game.
[325:08.29]It's great, though.
[325:10.75]I gotta... I gotta do... I... I gotta... Ugh.
[325:13.63]Okay.
[325:14.31]We'll continue tomorrow.
[325:19.33]Lady.
[325:21.42]There ain't anything in here to do.
[325:27.46]yeah I think you kind of may have accidentally walked in here oh man alright I forgot this even image was even still here oh
[325:48.60]And I'll see you tomorrow.
[325:50.10]We're going to pick up with this tomorrow.
[325:52.00]And maybe spend another hour or two in it.
[325:54.05]Maybe try and do some more things.
[325:56.39]Once it becomes like I've had enough, we're going to potentially do that Prime watch a movie together thing.
[326:04.69]Just because I just want to do it for no reason.
[326:08.63]That was a lot of fun.
[326:11.42]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[326:12.98]Take care of yourselves.
[326:13.80]We'll start probably around the same time, around 3.30, probably-ish, 4 o'clock, between 3 and 4, between 3 and 4 p.m.
[326:19.06]And that's going to be it.
[326:22.97]Take care of yourselves.
[326:23.61]See you soon.
[326:25.19]Let's do the end of the stream.
[326:30.05]That was Casino Inc., by the way.
[326:31.45]If you're like, what was that?
[326:35.14]I would like to play it.
[326:36.06]It's Casino Inc.
[326:40.59]That was traumatic.
[326:41.73]Yes, it was.
[326:44.03]It was very traumatic.
[326:47.23]It was insane.
[326:49.09]Anyways, let's do the bits.
[326:51.57]Let's go back to earlier.
[326:52.27]I missed a bunch of bits.
[326:54.11]I was just so hyper into what was going on on the screen that I missed a bunch of stuff.
[326:59.76]I do apologize for that.
[327:01.68]But let's go back.
[327:02.30]Let's cover them all that were coming in.
[327:06.19]So, we had 250 at the beginning from StixRenegade.
[327:08.47]Hey Jermboy, thanks for deciding to play Jackie Chan Stuntmaster on June 11th, 2020.
[327:13.03]It means a lot.
[327:15.51]That's a fake date for a fake video game that I'm fake not going to play.
[327:20.11]Well, I'm not going to play it.
[327:21.39]That's what I'm saying.
[327:27.56]Thanks for the 250.
[327:30.44]Hey, thank you, uh, Tel Naga for the $2.75.
[327:32.72]Um, I don't even want to read this out loud.
[327:37.12]It's just fingers, whatever.
[327:38.78]Thanks for the $2.75.
[327:39.52]Thanks for the $2.75.
[327:42.80]Hey, Espada Escalada, thanks for the $2.50.
[327:45.00]Hey, Jerma, just some quick bits in celebration of my one year sub anniversary.
[327:48.92]Thank you.
[327:50.58]Thanks for subbing this channel for any reason.
[327:55.83]If you got a community sub and you kept it, cool.
[327:59.89]If you didn't, that's cool too.
[328:01.79]If you've been subbed for a year, awesome.
[328:03.51]10 years, thank you.
[328:05.71]Or if you just watched, that's fucking great too.
[328:09.37]Thanks a lot.
[328:10.73]It was fingers in his ass Sunday.
[328:12.11]Yes, it was.
[328:14.11]Yeah.
[328:17.51]A whole of one zombie thanks to the 250.
[328:19.21]I feel like chat needs to give a piece of paper with a childlike handwriting on it.
[328:24.49]And you'd read it in the auto voice.
[328:25.97]I feel bad for Beautiful Joe.
[328:29.21]Beautiful Joe had to be sacrificed for Casino Inc to be played.
[328:31.81]It's sad.
[328:52.02]Good.
[328:52.50]Worth it.
[328:53.08]Yeah, but I mean, but I was, I eventually was gonna play Casino Inc.
[328:56.55]I've had it on the list for a long time.
[329:00.81]Hey, Abomination Zero, thanks for the 260.
[329:02.41]Put your face on the guy in the corner.
[329:05.35]I think we did that for about an hour or two.
[329:08.49]Worked out pretty well.
[329:11.17]Hey, Anarchy, the OP, thanks for $5.
[329:13.52]Watching Jerma is like having Blue's Clues on TV.
[329:16.06]Why?
[329:18.70]Why?
[329:21.37]El Sambo, thanks for the 500 bits.
[329:22.95]Back to VR, please.
[329:24.18]I will eventually.
[329:24.90]I'm starting to feel a little bit better.
[329:29.76]I will move to VR when I'm ready.
[329:35.38]Hey, Marvash Magali, thanks for the 250.
[329:36.86]Irma, how do you reply to the rumor that Bernie Sanders decided to drop out of the presidential race after finding out that you decided to raid Kiwo instead of him?
[329:53.54]You guys would never have behaved yourselves.
[329:55.62]There's no way that you guys would have been... Like, a hundred of you would have gotten banned.
[330:00.94]Instantly.
[330:01.94]And then it would have been like, who fucking sent these people?
[330:09.15]There are some lines that I need to draw, and it's trolling the potential next president of the United States.
[330:16.69]I think I have to draw the line there, somewhere.
[330:19.33]Yeah, I think that's where the line potentially needs to be drawn.
[330:29.45]The coward.
[330:31.55]I said potential.
[330:32.49]I didn't say next.
[330:33.07]I said potential.
[330:38.29]He would have raided you.
[330:39.19]Imagine getting raided by Bernie Sanders.
[330:42.17]How do you even react to that?
[330:43.21]That'd be a trip.
[330:50.60]He's got emotes and he's got like a big... What if Bernie had like a pog face emote?
[330:57.46]He has like all the typical streamer emotes.
[331:00.18]Like Bernie with a heart.
[331:01.28]Like Bernie with a pog face.
[331:02.62]Bernie with like a oh shit face.
[331:05.80]Bernie with like a face palm.
[331:10.60]I want everybody to go and raid jermaOn A5.
[331:14.23]And please.
[331:15.97]Do Bernie pog.
[331:17.65]I want him to know.
[331:20.85]I want to see Bernie pogs.
[331:27.80]That's Obama.
[331:28.48]It's been a long night.

[331:31.60]It's been five hours.
[331:33.06]But it's still.

[336:26.68]I could live in a casino.
[336:27.78]You never know.
[336:33.74]But one thing I will say.
[336:40.89]It doesn't matter where you live.
[336:42.47]As long as you like where you live.
[336:46.51]It doesn't matter where you live.
[336:47.86]But who cares?

[338:13.67]That's what I'm saying.
[338:17.61]What if someone was just going for a walk?
[338:24.55]I just freak out.
[338:26.43]Somebody's outside walking by my house right now.

[341:16.59]Happy birthday to you.
[341:18.73]Happy birthday to you.
[341:26.92]Happy birthday.
[341:27.36]Happy 19th birthday.
[341:28.42]Somebody else's birthday is on Monday, and I'm supposed to stream on Monday, but if I don't, happy birthday to the person that's fucking birthday is on Monday, and I'm happy birthday if I don't see you.
[341:42.16]Thank you, Twonko.
[341:42.88]Happy birthday.
[341:45.24]Well, yeah.
[341:45.56]Pretty true.
[341:59.16]What the fuck?
[342:29.06]Noodle is bad at gaming.
[342:30.02]Thanks for 250.
[342:30.62]This casino reminds me of the hotel they stay at in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
[342:35.38]Also, please consider my group therapy stream idea.
[342:37.37]I need this in my life.
[342:38.21]Hire an actor instead of a therapist if you must.
[342:46.27]Okay, a group therapy stream would just be the family dinner stream again.
[342:57.20]That's what it would be.
[342:58.42]The only difference would be somebody would be there.
[343:03.44]Sitting there.
[343:05.72]Pretending to be a therapist.
[343:06.88]Time for part two.
[343:10.60]Let's see if I can get the gang back together again.
[343:12.59]I don't know about that.
[343:15.87]Miami Hotlines, thanks for the thousand bits.
[343:17.65]King, your interior decoration skills need work.
[343:19.81]Your casino is ugly.
[343:20.93]Eh, it's alright.
[343:29.85]It's okay.
[343:31.79]I said I wasn't going to read King out loud anymore, but I just did.
[343:35.25]Let's put the credits on here.
[343:37.09]What do you say?
[343:39.88]All these subs.
[343:40.42]Thanks a lot, guys.
[343:42.50]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[343:43.22]If I can even run them.
[343:51.30]Let me...
[343:54.93]There they go.
[343:56.61]Thanks a lot, guys, for your subscriptions.
[343:59.38]I appreciate it.
[344:07.58]Whether you've been subbed for a year, subbed for a week, subbed for a month, or never ever.
[344:11.02]Thanks again.
[344:14.51]Opposites attract.
[344:15.27]Isn't there a whole thing about that?
[344:51.20]They hate each other.
[344:52.10]You guys have magnets.
[345:00.45]How do you... Hold on, let me think about this.
[345:03.85]How do you... Couples don't have much in common.
[345:07.24]Well, things that me and Kim have in common, you guys don't see.
[345:10.90]you don't hear about like Kim doesn't really play very many video games or doesn't really she's not really into this whole space here she's not really into Twitch or youtube or like gaming really but that's we have a lot of other stuff in common that you guys don't even see so but
[345:34.42]In terms of how would you make it work if you didn't have anything in common?
[345:43.03]I don't know.
[345:43.39]I really can't answer that question.
[345:45.65]Unfortunately, I can't really give you a good answer.
[345:53.31]Because I'm trying to think of if I've ever been in a scenario that was like that.
[345:58.34]But in all the relationships that I've had, there's been at least a few things that we really clicked on.
[346:07.95]So I really can't give you too much advice on this.
[346:11.38]Or I can't give you my thoughts on it, because I don't really have an experience with it.
[346:17.76]Like what?
[346:18.10]What do you have in common?
[346:19.54]We both knit.
[346:21.20]We both sew.
[346:29.99]We both... Like, we both love wine.
[346:33.63]We both like wine.
[346:34.39]We're very, very passionate about wine.
[346:37.07]We both love food.
[346:38.67]We both love animals.
[346:41.37]A majority of our conversations are about animals.
[346:44.21]Are about dogs.
[346:45.29]Specifically Otto.
[346:47.48]Um... We both live in North Las Vegas, you know?
[346:53.06]Right?
[346:54.78]Or Henderson.
[346:56.08]Or Summerlin.
[346:57.44]Or...
[346:59.18]Enterprise?
[347:00.30]Or?
[347:00.44]I don't live on the Strip.
[347:07.45]Nobody can live on the Strip.
[347:08.35]It doesn't work that way.
[347:10.93]Nobody, like, lives in, like, the Bellagio, guys.
[347:13.64]That's not how it works.
[347:20.62]Well, that pretty much confirms the Strip.
[347:29.49]Stop.
[347:30.97]Stop that.
[347:36.83]Oh, we got him.
[347:37.99]Nobody got me.
[347:38.61]Nobody got me!
[347:41.15]Uh, no, but we have plenty of things in common.
[347:48.01]I don't know anything about knitting at all.
[347:49.35]I made that up to make us seem cute.
[347:53.21]Shit.
[347:55.25]How do you have so much energy?
[347:57.75]Uh, it bottles up to a point where it can't contain it anymore and it has to come out either with a loud expletive noise or it just has to come out.
[348:07.26]It has to.
[348:15.82]But thank you, Snooze, for the $15.
[348:17.02]Appreciate it.
[348:18.00]Miami Hotlines again, $2.50.
[348:18.94]Wow, King, you're so bad at this game.
[348:20.78]That's really epic and sexy of you.
[348:22.30]That's funny.
[348:23.62]That actually is kind of a funny comment.
[348:25.61]The little end of it, it's funny too.
[348:27.67]Thanks for the $2.50.
[348:28.55]Thanks, The Fax Machine, for the five community subs.
[348:32.45]Appreciate that.
[348:35.51]$50 from Goiki.
[348:36.15]Goiki, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[348:37.59]Clown Convention Waiting Room.
[348:39.61]I know, and we didn't get to see it.
[348:40.95]We didn't get to even see it.
[348:43.25]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[348:47.75]Fifty fucking dollars, dude.
[348:54.10]It was a little while ago.
[348:55.72]But sorry I missed it.
[348:56.98]It's a lot of money.
[349:01.28]Hey, Geolove, thanks for three dollars.
[349:03.50]Jerma, go see the clowns.
[349:04.84]I didn't.
[349:05.38]I know.
[349:06.62]The shit went off the rails there at the end.
[349:09.93]We'll come back to it tomorrow.
[349:10.81]We'll figure it out.
[349:12.96]PixelatedCabbage, thanks for 250 Jerma.
[349:14.82]I saw that you played Super Mario RPG last year, and I was wondering if you would ever play Paper Mario.
[349:19.66]Maybe around August for the first game's 20th anniversary.
[349:30.33]I mean, August is long enough away where I could lie to you and say yes, and then forget.
[349:35.19]But I'm not gonna do that.
[349:36.03]I feel like I do that quite often.
[349:43.53]I'm going to say maybe.
[349:45.09]Maybe.
[349:45.77]For the 20th anniversary.
[349:46.77]Maybe.
[349:48.87]I know people love that game.
[349:50.45]Worth a shot.
[349:52.75]Hey, Skinny Peter.
[349:54.03]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[349:55.05]Jeremy, if we're going to get an Easy Bake Oven stream, could we also get a Creepy Crawly Bug Maker stream?
[350:01.24]That's part of the plan.
[350:04.48]Not only is it going to be an Easy Bake Oven stream, but I'm also getting a bunch of other of those toy food item game things.
[350:10.73]And that's going to be one of them.
[350:11.83]Although I might refuse to eat them.
[350:13.63]Because they, Creepy Crawler, Bug Maker shit, released in like 1998.
[350:19.25]And this stuff probably is not edible anymore.
[350:21.25]We'll find out if there's any new ones.
[350:24.55]Thanks for the thousand bits though.
[350:27.06]Okay.
[350:27.22]Political Bernie Pog.
[350:57.59]God, you guys are on point tonight.
[351:02.05]Find his address and what political party does he follow?
[351:07.76]You guys are fucking on fire tonight.
[351:18.61]He's actually North East Vegas.
[351:21.35]North East Vegas left leaning.
[351:30.56]You guys are fucking nuts.
[351:39.77]Northeast, Vegas, left.
[351:41.95]Alright.
[351:44.01]Do it.
[351:46.36]We've had so many conversations on this stream about random shit.
[351:49.72]You could probably fucking piece together the type of kind of political leanings that I have.
[351:56.22]It's not, you know what I mean?
[351:57.48]Like, do I really, do you really, what do you think?
[352:07.52]He's a fucking liberal.
[352:09.22]He's a liberal.
[352:11.52]He must be.
[352:12.18]He's gotta be.
[352:13.04]He's gotta be.
[352:14.11]And that fires me up.
[352:16.54]No.
[352:17.16]No, no, no, no, no.
[352:18.22]No, he's probably... He's one of those fucking right wingers.
[352:23.91]God, I hate those motherfuckers.
[352:26.41]You understand how there's no winning here?
[352:37.18]If I say one of these out loud, half of you hate me.
[352:40.64]For the rest of my life.
[352:42.56]You understand how this works?
[352:46.24]Even if I do fall politically in one of these categories, saying it out loud is, like, a third of you no longer want to hear me talk anymore.
[353:02.01]We don't already?
[353:02.99]Oh, goddammit.
[353:08.28]The East.
[353:09.36]Left-leaning.
[353:10.24]Goddammit.
[353:12.20]Alright, alright, enough, enough, enough, enough.
[353:14.70]We're moving on.
[353:15.56]We're moving on from this.
[353:17.30]I don't like that.
[353:17.98]I don't like this joke.
[353:19.41]We're moving on from it.
[353:20.43]It's too, alright, too much.
[353:21.83]Let's go.
[353:26.53]No more, no more of this, no more of this, no more of this, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more.
[353:32.72]Here, okay.
[353:34.20]I live in a giant shoe in the middle of space.
[353:38.81]And I'm not even from your fucking planet.
[353:41.80]So how am I supposed to know where I've leaned politically on your planet?
[353:45.16]I don't even know what this is.
[353:46.44]I don't even know what the Democrat, Republican, Left, Serb... I don't know what that is.
[353:51.52]I've got my own system up here.
[353:52.88]There you go.
[354:01.63]There's your answer.
[354:03.11]For all of your questions.
[354:05.67]Thanks, Goober Juice, for the five dollars.
[354:08.18]Hey, OhNoLudo985, these are some memes in chat that you missed.
[354:12.48]Why do we have like a chat meme recap?
[354:18.36]I thought I should start donating these so that the creators of these memes can get your reaction.
[354:23.76]Also, last stream you implied that something was going to happen to Bugleberry in the future.
[354:31.51]No, no, that's not what I'm talking about.
[354:39.19]Spookaberry's gonna be fine, don't worry.
[354:45.55]But for the meme reactions... Here's what's gonna happen.
[354:50.29]This is what's gonna happen here.
[354:53.41]I don't know how this is gonna be done, but this is how it's gonna be done.
[354:57.05]There's a lot of images that come on this stream.
[354:59.41]Tons of people give images.
[355:01.55]There's links and links, and hey, I wanna see this, I wanna see that.
[355:04.17]Hey, check this out.
[355:04.95]Look at this, there's a Photoshop.
[355:06.81]What's going to happen is I'm going to have a window browser source that is capturing a website.
[355:14.05]That website will be... I'm not going to tell you what website this is because I don't... Fuck, who cares?
[355:24.04]It's Reddit.
[355:24.34]This is going to be a Reddit that's specifically going to be for image uploads.
[355:31.52]And I can capture it and over the course of the stream, I can just cap it and we can go through like three or four...
[355:39.08]They'll just be right there.
[355:40.56]And if there's images that come through the stream, like there always is, like at least five, six, seven of them come out of each stream, they'll already be captured and we can already just do it.
[355:51.04]And they can be, you know, if we have a good enough non-shit posting kind of, like, I'm just going to spam the Reddit.
[356:01.41]We'll have people check them before I click them.
[356:10.78]So there'll be ways for me to check that it'll work out.
[356:14.35]And then it keeps image links out of the chat room so people can chat or yell their favorite video game at me once a day.
[356:26.01]And we can have that in a separate place that is easy for me to get to.
[356:38.75]Crash Bandicoot 2, that's your favorite game?
[356:41.43]Well, we should probably talk about that.
[356:43.39]But that's where they're gonna be.
[356:48.45]And by the way, I'm making the Reddit.
[356:51.62]So it's like, well, okay, I have two already.
[356:54.54]No, no, no, no, no.
[356:55.26]I'm gonna own this shit.
[356:59.18]And you will not know what it is until it is ready.
[357:01.30]And it's only gonna come from my mouth.
[357:02.80]But that's where it's gonna go.
[357:12.89]Why'd you call me out like that?
[357:14.81]I said, we have to talk about that.
[357:19.05]Why not Crash Bandicoot 3?
[357:21.37]Racing, team racing.
[357:22.83]Why 2?
[357:24.19]I thought 3 was a better one.
[357:25.43]3 had more characters, 3 had more tracks, and it was graphically superior.
[357:40.85]That's just my opinion, that's what I think.
[357:43.05]Is there a Crash Team Racing 3?
[357:45.51]Is there one?
[357:50.49]No.
[357:51.92]Okay.
[357:53.62]Never mind.
[357:56.86]But, in the meantime, we're gonna have to abstain from clicking on images until I get that shit going.
[358:07.67]I'm gonna try to get that going over the next few days.
[358:10.75]Probably, like, next week.
[358:11.61]Or in, like, probably two months.
[358:12.59]Because that's, like, a real time frame for my fucking high koala brain.
[358:20.38]But, uh, let's see.
[358:21.24]What do you got?
[358:27.46]What do you got?
[358:29.49]What do you got?
[358:37.71]And there's a bunch of videos on here.
[358:47.14]Save him, save him, save him.
[358:48.48]There's like eight, there's like three videos and eight, like seven images on here.
[358:54.22]Well, it's three images and four videos.
[359:01.44]Save him for community content night.
[359:03.56]Oh, but we never see those because he never fucking does those either.
[359:06.72]Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
[359:13.80]Give it to me.
[359:14.22]Let me hear it.
[359:14.84]Let me hear it.
[359:15.59]I know.
[359:16.27]Let me hear it.
[359:19.54]At least click the last image.
[359:27.64]Hold on, let me load some of these up.
[359:28.96]Oh my fucking god.
[359:30.38]I- this is not even my- Okay, I'll show the images and let's- hold on a second.
[359:45.17]Oh, this is fucking terrifying.
[359:48.01]Why do all these have to be besides the Bernie Pog one?
[359:52.21]Oh, let's take a look at this one.
[360:06.47]Pretty good.
[360:11.79]Alright, that one's good.
[360:15.01]This is an Ed, Edd n Eddy picture of Ed.
[360:19.30]I believe that is him eating a shoe.
[360:24.16]It is.
[360:27.40]Okay.
[360:30.96]And then here is... Ernie Pog.
[360:36.98]Where is it?
[360:42.13]Oh, there.
[360:42.99]Okay, well, I didn't mean to stretch that.
[360:51.12]God damn it.
[360:58.14]And what is this one?
[361:03.15]I can't make that an emote, that's not my face!
[361:05.15]You can watch that if you want.
[361:23.48]It's like a ton of noise and a bunch of kids like You just walk it and you just go like
[361:57.91]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[362:00.51]That's the end.
[362:01.89]That's where it ends.
[362:03.87]Except!
[362:07.21]Uh, Squimst gave $10.50.
[362:08.31]$10.50.
[362:08.43]Thanks for the bits.
[362:13.20]Thanks for the big bits.
[362:14.20]That's over $10.
[362:15.04]Thank you.
[362:15.34]Hey, Jerm, I'm a college student who got kicked out of the dorms by the whole COVID situation.
[362:20.86]Streams have really helped me get through everything.
[362:22.80]I've been in quarantine with my dad and we watch your streams together pretty much every day.
[362:26.66]Anyway, it's his birthday tomorrow.
[362:27.86]If you could wish him a happy birthday, that would be pretty cool.
[362:31.44]Alright?
[362:31.88]But you don't have to.
[362:32.53]Of course I will.
[362:34.59]Hey, Louis!
[362:36.65]Happy birthday, Louis.
[362:39.65]Take care of each other.
[362:41.53]Hope you have a great one.
[362:45.41]Not sure how old you are, but... Hey.
[362:50.44]38 never looks so good, right?
[362:53.68]Happy birthday, Louis.
[362:55.42]Thanks for watching.
[362:55.94]You too.
[362:56.22]Both of you.
[363:05.98]38 with a college kid.
[363:07.12]I'm not, that's, that's like a, like a, hey, you look 38.
[363:11.16]And if you're like 40 or 55 or something like that, or if you're like in your 40s or 50s, like, oh, wow, I'm 30.
[363:16.31]I look 38.
[363:16.97]That's good.
[363:17.99]That's like a good thing.
[363:19.39]Like, hey, 38 never looked so good, right?
[363:20.97]You look like you're 38.
[363:21.97]You could be like 50.
[363:22.81]That's good.
[363:26.95]That's why I said that.
[363:28.66]That's a boomer joke.
[363:30.30]Yeah.
[363:30.80]Okay.
[363:31.54]Sweat out.
[363:31.98]What are you?
[363:32.68]I'm not, no, I'm not mocking anybody.
[363:35.58]So he doesn't look 38.
[363:36.88]No, I'm saying, like, let's say, for instance, let's just say, for instance, that somebody's, like, 50 years old or 45 years old.
[363:43.76]Hey, dude, like, hey, 38 never looked so good, right?
[363:46.52]Like, oh, 38, yeah, okay.
[363:48.96]You're fun.
[363:54.40]Just stop.
[363:54.95]We get it.
[363:55.61]No, you don't.
[363:56.41]Half of you don't.
[363:57.39]Half of you don't get it.
[364:02.59]And that's very clear.
[364:04.94]By the way that you are acting.
[364:15.15]See you tomorrow.
[364:17.67]Wait!
[364:19.25]I didn't want to miss the bits from Dumpus Rumpus.
[364:25.45]Dumpus Rumpus, thanks for five dollars.
[364:27.60]Jeremy, long time viewer, first time donator.
[364:29.28]Thanks, Dumpus.
[364:30.70]Thanks for being my favorite entertainer for the last, like, eight fucking years.
[364:34.98]I can't believe you still think I'm interesting eight years later.
[364:38.41]We've talked about this before, but watching TV shows after season seven or eight, usually people just don't fucking care anymore.
[364:50.46]So that's shocking to me.
[364:52.70]I'm like, I can't believe people still like this.
[364:55.85]So thanks.
[365:00.12]Appreciate it.
[365:01.58]No, we're not raiding any- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[365:10.90]I've got to get them under control.
[365:11.92]I've got to get them under control.
[365:14.68]It's going to take a double to get them under control.
[365:16.85]We're going to have to take a double, I think.
[365:19.47]Yep, it is.
[365:24.23]Stop.
[365:25.13]Stop.
[365:30.49]Okay, good.
[365:34.69]Hey, Jubby!
[365:35.93]Thanks for the five dollars.
[365:36.67]This has been a god tier stream.
[365:37.88]You've played Evil Genius.
[365:39.22]If you like this game, I think that'd make a great stream too.
[365:41.86]It's actually on a list.
[365:43.32]It is on the list.
[365:47.92]Jeremy, please.
[365:49.94]If you're gonna say my name, spell it correctly.
[366:01.45]I see it misspelled quite frequently, actually.
[366:07.32]Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
[366:08.40]Good night, guys.
[366:10.12]Take care.
[366:10.46]Have a great rest of your night.

[366:15.37]tomorrow afternoon, and then from there... From there, we will go to potentially watch a movie.
[366:23.23]I... I'm not going to talk about this tomorrow, I think.
[366:29.04]I'm going to talk about this tomorrow, but...
[366:32.94]Never mind.
[366:33.60]This is funny to me.
[366:34.78]I'm holding this for tomorrow.
[366:36.84]This is a funny thing that I'm going to say that I can't wait to say tomorrow.
[366:40.71]It's going to be great.
[366:41.35]I can't wait.
[366:42.09]We've got to pick the movie tomorrow.
[366:43.39]Tomorrow is pick the Amazon Prime movie.
[366:48.93]So during Casino Inc., I'm going to have to go on cam.
[366:52.07]We're going to have to figure this out.
[366:53.31]It's important.
[366:55.78]I'm not going to forget.
[367:00.94]Say it, I'll miss it.
[367:02.66]No, no, no.
[367:03.28]It's a part of that stream joke.
[367:06.26]That it's gonna be funny.
[367:07.24]It's gonna be very funny for me.
[367:11.20]No, it's not even a joke.
[367:12.18]It's not even a joke.
[367:13.50]It's just something funny that I think is funny.
[367:15.37]That's it.
[367:17.95]I'm gonna think it's funny.
[367:20.17]I don't need to write it down.
[367:22.19]Look, I don't need to write it down.
[367:24.99]It's not a joke.
[367:26.13]It's something that I'm gonna do on the stream.
[367:29.34]Or not do on the stream.
[367:30.84]Alright, let me.
[367:31.34]Okay, fine.
[367:33.18]No, I'm not going to say it because it's funny.
[367:36.02]Fine.
[367:37.04]No, it's funny.
[367:37.64]I'm not going to do it.
[367:38.36]I'm doing it tomorrow.
[367:39.18]See you tomorrow.
[367:39.54]Good night.
[367:40.70]Goodbye.
