[00:03.82]Hey, hey, hey.
[00:05.52]It's tummy time, baby.
[00:06.78]We're back.
[00:07.66]It's the Halloween special, joined by the most dangerous man on Twitch, Jerma.
[00:11.70]Very dangerous.
[00:12.73]Welcome to the Hub.
[00:14.03]We've got a lot of fun stuff planned today.
[00:16.69]So we do have costumes.
[00:17.85]We'll get into those a bit later.
[00:19.37]We don't know what they are yet.
[00:20.31]We've been told they're good.
[00:21.15]No idea.
[00:22.40]And a lot of the chat functionality that we've been talking about is finally here a bit.
[00:26.08]So the commands are, I think... They're below stream.
[00:28.36]They're below stream, so you can change the lights.
[00:31.10]There's, like, these mounted cannons up here.
[00:33.77]Yeah, there are weapons pointed at us right now, by the way.
[00:36.85]They're pretty fucking cool.
[00:37.57]It's actually kind of scary.
[00:39.01]There's also going to be a TENS unit for me, which you'll control.
[00:43.55]TENS unit is, like, electroshock therapy, which is...
[00:47.84]Fucking awesome.
[00:49.60]Something I really like, especially since like, you know, heart misfires.
[00:53.89]I also did not agree to it, so I'm not putting one on.
[00:56.47]Yeah, so it's just going to be me.
[00:58.21]Matt, you can bring it out.
[00:59.05]We can show them.
[01:00.89]So we're going to be cooking through all of these obstacles.
[01:04.12]and creating Halloween-themed dishes, as well as Drew's egg salad.
[01:07.97]That's right.
[01:09.47]Today, I'm going to prove to everybody here just how tasty, just how nutritious, and how unbelievable my family recipe is.
[01:18.03]Probably shouldn't have punched the microphone.
[01:19.59]But yeah, we're going to make the Elbertson family recipe egg salad.
[01:22.19]I've heard nothing but good things.
[01:23.77]It is.
[01:24.03]It's very good.
[01:25.39]I'm so nervous being over here.
[01:26.61]I'm not going to lie.
[01:28.04]No, you have plenty of time.
[01:29.04]They haven't learned the commands yet.
[01:30.86]So what are the commands?
[01:32.18]They have commands?
[01:32.98]We'll tell them in a second when I'm gone.
[01:36.55]Does one of the commands fire the weaponry at us?
[01:40.23]Artillery shells.
[01:41.01]This is the artillery commands?
[01:42.43]Alright, let's give that a try.
[01:44.89]Yeah, we can try one of the commands now.
[01:46.35]Which one is it for that?
[01:47.95]Oh, God.
[01:49.54]I probably plugged it in wrong.
[01:53.66]For the cannons or the cannons?
[01:55.86]You can try either.
[01:56.62]Which one is it?
[01:57.08]Do exclamation point blower.
[02:00.10]Yeah, try exclamation point blower.
[02:01.80]Let's make sure it works before we get going.
[02:09.61]It is aimed directly at both of us, by the way.
[02:12.37]I feel like it might not be set up correctly.
[02:15.55]We'll check on it.
[02:19.80]I'm ready to run.
[02:23.19]I said to you, I said to everybody here, I'm like, when these things turn on, I'm fucking out of here.
[02:26.96]I'm running the other direction.
[02:29.08]If they're not working now, they will be soon.
[02:31.34]Same with this.
[02:32.42]It's still learning.
[02:34.52]Getting the hiccups out of the way.
[02:35.50]That's going to be interesting for you.
[02:36.82]I'm very interested in that.
[02:38.32]I'm also interested in this pumpkin pie.
[02:40.56]Yep, so the first thing is some pumpkin pie.
[02:42.66]You said you don't like pumpkins.
[02:44.80]No, and if you could read this out loud, that'd be fantastic.
[02:47.50]Yep, so we're starting with the allrecipes.com pumpkin pie.
[02:51.66]And we're going to need two cups of mashed cooked pumpkin.
[02:54.80]Yep.
[02:56.44]This is like with these.
[02:59.86]Alright.
[03:00.60]What's the next one say?
[03:01.68]I can't see.
[03:02.67]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:03.25]The next one is some evaporated.
[03:04.67]I'll start on this.
[03:05.21]You get the evaporated milk.
[03:06.47]Yeah, okay, because I can't read, so.
[03:09.69]No, I've heard that as well.
[03:12.67]Where's the milk?
[03:13.05]What am I doing?
[03:13.71]What do we need?
[03:15.05]Oh.
[03:15.47]We need a cutting.
[03:16.09]Wait, we need milk?
[03:17.09]Yeah, get some.
[03:19.21]Evaporated.
[03:19.61]Get some milk and evaporated, I guess.
[03:21.17]Where's your pantry?
[03:23.69]Over there.
[03:24.75]Evaporated milk is usually in the pantry, right?
[03:26.73]I think, I don't know.
[03:32.43]I don't care about anything else.
[03:34.03]By the way, this is the last one, and it's mine.
[03:38.68]Why do you have Cosmic Brownie?
[03:44.82]Oh, by the way, I just want to make sure whoever is the next guest on this show, I left the Cosmic Brownie container and it ended up in it.
[03:52.98]That was a fucking prank.
[03:54.30]What an idiot.
[03:55.40]Whoever opens that.
[03:56.46]Quick update.
[03:56.94]Tell them to do exclamation point blowers.
[03:59.77]Oh.
[04:00.35]Try exclamation point blowers.
[04:03.41]The next one over.
[04:04.17]The next one over?
[04:04.97]Oh, this.
[04:07.11]Okay.
[04:07.39]Jesus.
[04:07.61]It's so scary back here.
[04:11.93]Are you okay?
[04:16.41]I'm good.
[04:18.41]Alright.
[04:19.62]This is dangerous shit.
[04:20.46]So that's set up.
[04:22.40]Are we going to clean this?
[04:25.94]It won't matter.
[04:27.88]It'll be good for the pumpkin pie.
[04:29.78]I got the evaporated milk.
[04:31.34]Wipe off the stove before you turn it off.
[04:35.90]Oh, God.
[04:36.06]Can I cut the pumpkin for the love of God before this?
[04:38.99]I'm good.
[04:39.45]I actually don't know about this.
[04:42.49]We're good.
[04:43.85]This thing is electrocuting your arm.
[04:45.78]That's actually not safe.
[04:46.94]Let me cut this.
[04:47.74]No, no, no.
[04:49.08]I can handle it.
[04:51.06]What's the... I'm scared.
[04:52.82]What's the power set at, Matt?
[04:54.16]That was like 20, I think.
[04:55.30]He's a paper towel, goddammit.
[04:56.82]I was able to fight through it.
[04:57.94]If I don't be honest, I'm going to tape them down for you, too.
[05:01.78]Okay.
[05:02.18]Why did we do this first?
[05:04.25]I don't know.
[05:04.59]This is kind of tough, actually.
[05:05.77]This is like not coming up.
[05:07.83]Okay.
[05:08.59]Yeah, but you have to season your stovetop before you use it, right?
[05:11.93]Yeah, it's kind of like when you put like a sauce in a bag of chicken and shake it around a little bit.
[05:16.37]Oh, fucking revolting.
[05:17.25]I hate this.
[05:19.21]I'm sorry, but I'm telling you right now, the inside of a pumpkin is one of the grossest fucking things in all humanity.
[05:24.59]I hate it.
[05:25.35]It smells awful.
[05:26.27]It looks awful.
[05:28.82]Well, I disagree.
[05:29.60]I like pumpkin.
[05:31.02]But would you eat that?
[05:31.76]No, absolutely not.
[05:32.74]I'm not a psychopath.
[05:33.66]Yeah.
[05:35.34]Do you want to cut the next one?
[05:36.40]We need two of these, right?
[05:37.18]We need two of them?
[05:37.76]OK.
[05:38.14]Well, I got the evaporated milk.
[05:39.72]I don't know where to just go.
[05:40.58]I don't know what to do.
[05:42.58]That's not it.
[05:43.00]Alright.
[05:43.80]Do you have a can opener?
[05:49.09]Somewhere.
[05:49.71]We need to clean this stove top.
[05:54.29]I haven't carved a pumpkin since I was a kid.
[05:56.31]Am I doing it right?
[05:57.39]You just shake these out?
[05:59.61]So what is it?
[06:00.59]You have to give her the seeds, right?
[06:01.79]Yeah.
[06:04.34]Oh, true, true, true.
[06:05.32]Let me get a can opener, whatever that is.
[06:10.41]What is this?
[06:11.07]Oh, Jesus.
[06:13.46]What is this?
[06:14.72]Is it a lighter?
[06:27.38]Where's your can opener?
[06:29.20]I have no idea.
[06:31.43]Do you have a can opener?
[06:32.67]These keep going off, but they're not, like, making my muscles tense up.
[06:35.71]It's just kind of, like, vibrating my arms.
[06:37.53]It just feels weird.
[06:38.07]And it feels so weird.
[06:40.65]I practiced with these last week, and they were not this odd.
[06:44.65]My hands are so sticky already.
[06:45.92]We haven't even done one ingredient yet.
[06:47.78]Has it been, like, 40 minutes?
[06:50.44]Welcome to the kitchen with Charles.
[06:54.34]We need a can opener.
[06:58.91]Do you need to get all the seeds out?
[07:00.39]Are they like apple seeds?
[07:01.97]Are they cyanide-based?
[07:09.73]Found a can opener.
[07:10.95]That a boy.
[07:11.99]How much evaporated milk do we need, does it say?
[07:15.63]12 fluid ounces.
[07:16.75]What is this one?
[07:17.35]This is... I have a strategy here.
[07:20.27]What if I do this?
[07:23.74]This is 12 fluid... Okay, 12 fluid ounces of evaporated milk.
[07:30.81]Am I doing this?
[07:31.45]I think I fucked it up.
[07:33.59]Am I doing this right?
[07:37.09]Don't do that!
[07:38.07]Alright, give me that knife!
[07:39.45]Like, seriously, give me the knife.
[07:40.63]It's not mine.
[07:41.37]No, dude, I don't like this.
[07:43.73]No, give me this knife.
[07:44.97]Move this out of the way, we can do this after.
[07:46.85]Okay, yeah, let's do the can opener's probably safer.
[07:49.31]You know what, you take the can opener, please.
[07:51.80]You can do that.
[07:52.76]I'll finish this part here.
[07:55.82]He's electrocuting your hand with your RGB knife set.
[07:59.91]Like, I don't know about that.
[08:00.87]It's the CSGO fade skin.
[08:03.49]It's fine.
[08:03.91]So we're getting rid of this.
[08:06.41]Is it still what I'm used to with that 60, 70?
[08:10.11]We're pumping it up a little bit for you.
[08:12.19]Oh, that's not well, yeah.
[08:16.21]Why did people decide to eat this?
[08:18.73]You know what I mean?
[08:19.35]It was like, oh, yeah, let me eat this, like, slop that came out of the fucking pumpkin.
[08:23.53]Why would we eat this?
[08:25.51]That's what I'm saying, but I'm glad that pioneer figured it out.
[08:29.89]So now we have to, what does it say, OK?
[08:31.85]I don't think I'm actually .
[08:33.73]We need to measure this out, don't we?
[08:40.56]Is it touching it?
[08:42.24]Oh, yeah, it's in the same pocket.
[08:44.10]Oh, it is, yeah.
[08:44.38]You're like a muscle tension unit with a fucking knife in your hand.
[08:48.82]That's because I like to live dangerously.
[08:51.26]That's living very dangerously.
[08:55.88]Okay.
[08:56.54]There we go.
[08:57.08]So we're going to need a second pumpkin then, right?
[08:59.30]Yeah.
[08:59.64]So we're going to need two, maybe even three.
[09:02.41]There you go.
[09:02.99]Okay, let me go ahead.
[09:04.91]Behind.
[09:05.69]So next is two large eggs.
[09:07.51]I don't want to do that pumpkin.
[09:10.17]Behind.
[09:10.43]I'll do this one.
[09:14.11]Oh, wow.
[09:14.99]What happened?
[09:16.07]They changed the light.
[09:17.03]What are you doing?
[09:17.77]What's happening?
[09:18.45]Does it take a picture of us?
[09:21.73]Oh, it's Halloween.
[09:23.11]Yeah, it's the storm setting to be very scary.
[09:25.19]Oh, it's scary.
[09:26.11]Yeah.
[09:27.09]I want a bigger knife.
[09:27.93]I've heard of this.
[09:29.33]Do we have a cutting board?
[09:30.45]Why am I out there?
[09:31.15]I want a nice knife.
[09:31.69]Right here.
[09:32.21]Right over there.
[09:33.62]Oh, I see you got eggs in there.
[09:35.34]Yeah, so we're going to need two large eggs as well.
[09:36.94]You may not need eggs just yet because you're going to have to boil the pumpkins first.
[09:43.44]We have to boil the pumpkins?
[09:45.56]Oh.
[09:45.62]Alert.
[09:47.70]This actually, like, it's kind of cool.
[09:49.54]Yeah, this is really nice actually for Halloween.
[09:52.61]Oh, and I'm going to wash my hands before getting into this.
[09:54.72]I love how I just hear, be careful.
[10:05.97]I'm just realizing right now how dangerous of a program this really is.
[10:09.17]Yeah, you should have... What happened?
[10:13.39]The night vision... There's gas!
[10:16.80]We have a night vision cam for when the lights inevitably get turned off.
[10:20.89]This knife is not working.
[10:22.07]We need a different knife.
[10:23.45]This one's probably sharper.
[10:26.57]Okay, so we need two cups of mashed, cooked pumpkin pie.
[10:33.09]Yeah, so do we have to cook that separately?
[10:35.03]Yeah, so read the first instructions.
[10:36.51]Oh, preheat the oven to 400.
[10:37.84]Do you know how to do that?
[10:42.10]I don't use the oven.
[10:44.76]I'm just going to put 400...
[10:49.05]I think this is a microwave.
[10:53.38]How do people cut stuff?
[10:59.64]Am I just being a fucking idiot?
[11:01.64]Am I doing this wrong?
[11:06.02]That's so huge.
[11:06.86]There you go.
[11:08.34]Jerma, we're killing it.
[11:09.42]Did you see that?
[11:10.30]I just preheated that.
[11:11.35]Did you preheat it?
[11:11.99]Yep.
[11:14.85]Yeah, she's empty.
[11:17.91]That old harlot.
[11:20.11]Alright.
[11:21.85]Cut a fresh pie pumpkin in half.
[11:26.63]What the fuck is that stuff?
[11:27.67]Cut a pumpkin pie in half?
[11:29.19]We haven't made it yet.
[11:29.94]So those are pie pumpkins.
[11:30.76]They're specifically made to make pumpkin pie.
[11:34.62]Oh, like that's the species?
[11:36.92]Oh, fuck me.
[11:38.06]God damn it, dude.
[11:39.24]Give me a break.
[11:42.94]Now just give it a nice hollowing out.
[11:44.70]OK.
[11:48.83]Oh, that actually works.
[11:49.73]That's a good tip.
[11:51.17]It's very spongy in there.
[11:53.45]Scoop out seeds and stringy portions, leave skin on, and cut pumpkin into chunks.
[12:00.73]Is that like the pumpkin?
[12:03.29]The crust?
[12:04.05]Yes.
[12:04.75]OK, so how do we separate the seeds from the flesh, whatever it is, right?
[12:09.91]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:12.54]And then measure out one and a half pounds for this rice.
[12:17.00]I can eyeball that.
[12:18.00]I'm really good with that.
[12:21.96]Sorry.
[12:22.76]Pumpkins just broke me up.
[12:23.76]Well, put it in the bowl.
[12:24.98]We still need that other pumpkin.
[12:26.16]We need this piece?
[12:27.06]Yeah.
[12:27.58]Well, no, no, no, no.
[12:28.26]This is the gross bits that you don't eat.
[12:29.94]No, no, no, no.
[12:30.52]The other pumpkin.
[12:31.30]It's like eating the cartilage.
[12:32.73]Wait, we need this pumpkin?
[12:35.37]Yeah, that whole pumpkin.
[12:36.39]We need the whole, how?
[12:37.63]Yeah, we need a lot of pumpkin for this.
[12:39.59]What?
[12:40.11]OK, well.
[12:43.12]I might have cut this really weirdly.
[12:46.60]I think I just have to wait for you now.
[12:47.78]Yeah, because now the next part is measuring out one and a half pounds of pumpkin.
[12:55.82]That knife is not very good for this, to be honest with you.
[12:58.72]I'll take one of these bad boys.
[13:01.35]Like, do we eat the pumpkin skin?
[13:03.81]You eat pumpkin skin?
[13:04.71]Do you?
[13:04.91]I think you just need those two.
[13:06.29]If you look in the black cauldron right there to your left,
[13:10.34]Yes.
[13:11.78]So do we need this stuff or do we need the goo in the middle?
[13:21.88]What have you done?
[13:23.28]I don't know.
[13:24.98]What have you done?
[13:25.56]I wasn't looking.
[13:26.74]What have you done?
[13:27.70]No, wait, my evaporated milk.
[13:29.98]Oh, that's nice.
[13:31.82]Oh, what the fuck?
[13:35.66]Why is it shooting projectiles?
[13:39.43]I don't know.
[13:41.65]This is going to need a professional cleaning before we can cook on it.
[13:44.31]No, we are the professionals here.
[13:47.00]Alright, so this is happening here.
[13:49.26]I didn't see a scoop in there, so I'm going to give you like a ladle.
[13:54.22]By the way, why is this like a dog bowl?
[13:56.22]Oh, that actually would be very helpful.
[14:00.57]Thank you.
[14:02.31]And then I just need one and a half pounds.
[14:06.77]I think a seed just went down my underwear.
[14:10.54]Where am I supposed to put this?
[14:11.46]You need a bigger bowl too.
[14:13.86]Oh yeah, we have a lot of different sized dog bowls.
[14:16.22]We have all the way up to like Mastiff.
[14:19.70]Mmm, this looks good!
[14:21.24]No it doesn't!
[14:22.00]Nobody should eat this.
[14:22.73]The seeds are good.
[14:25.73]The pumpkin seeds do go kind of hard.
[14:27.17]Have you ever had like salted pumpkin seeds?
[14:29.63]Yeah, but they've got to be roasted.
[14:34.65]This is all seeds.
[14:35.77]There's like nothing in here.
[14:37.57]You can probably leave a few seeds in there for character.
[14:41.63]This pumpkin pie is going to be like pie crust and like no filling.
[14:47.31]Just the way mom used to make it.
[14:49.92]My mother's probably just, her steam is coming out of my mother's ears.
[14:55.98]There was no powdered sugar in that one, so we're good.
[14:58.07]I know, but I still don't want to get it in my fucking eyeballs.
[15:01.80]My mother's steam is coming out of my mother's ears right now.
[15:04.42]My mother cooks.
[15:05.90]She's always cooking, and she's probably looking at this going, like, what the fuck?
[15:08.70]She's probably taking notes, like, damn, this sounds like a good pumpkin pie recipe over here.
[15:12.24]Okay, so we have the innards of two pumpkins here.
[15:17.82]We need to separate the seeds from the goo.
[15:20.12]I'll get the spices out, I think.
[15:21.88]Now you're just going to cut up those shells.
[15:25.03]When you're scooping out, you're going to basically just put them aside, and then you're going to cut up the actual pumpkin into the chunks.
[15:34.27]I didn't hear you.
[15:34.75]Can we just order a pizza?
[15:38.20]I think we'll be fine.
[15:43.86]It's like spider webs in here.
[15:45.24]Just really get after it.
[15:46.95]You're holding up the whole production line.
[15:48.47]I'm trying to get at it.
[15:49.49]Did you not find a pumpkin trooper?
[15:52.03]No, there wasn't one in the cauldron.
[15:55.12]OK, well, I mean, this is as good as it's going to get.
[15:57.88]Knife drawer of the bottom left?
[15:59.28]Oh, so like right where you're standing, that very bottom drawer.
[16:04.01]Go get it, get it.
[16:07.73]There's actually a, wait, there's a device that makes this easier?
[16:09.93]I'm using like a soup ladle.
[16:15.50]Oh my goodness!
[16:16.26]That would be so easy!
[16:18.12]Oh my god!
[16:19.28]It's like lockpicking.
[16:20.26]Now you have to use them in tandem.
[16:22.16]Jesus.
[16:22.66]This is like... This is a... How am I using this?
[16:25.69]Okay.
[16:26.29]That's good.
[16:30.23]Oh my god, it's so much easier.
[16:33.11]Now this thing's got like teeth on it.
[16:35.29]This is perfect.
[16:35.91]Oh, that well-oiled machine now.
[16:38.46]Yeah, look at this.
[16:39.12]Look at this movement here.
[16:40.08]Look at this one.
[16:41.52]Look at that one.
[16:42.68]Look at this movement here.
[16:44.84]Look at that.
[16:46.10]Came out like nothing.
[16:47.14]Look at this one.
[16:48.98]Then I need... What the fuck do I do with a half pound of this?
[16:56.77]Two cups of mashed?
[16:58.37]Oh, we have to mash it.
[17:02.53]It's like Thanksgiving and you go into the room and like mom and dad are cooking and they're like...
[17:09.13]It's like, oh, I guess I'll eat it when it's done.
[17:13.05]Alright, I'm getting the boiling started.
[17:16.57]Oh, wait, we have to cut these.
[17:18.29]Well, it's going to take a minute to boil.
[17:28.92]OK, so we need to cut this pumpkin up.
[17:32.00]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:32.72]Alright, this made it so much easier, by the way.
[17:38.45]Actually using a tool.
[17:41.22]OK, this one is good to go, I would say.
[17:42.84]Oh.
[17:46.74]Stop doing that.
[17:48.82]Alright, I'm going to heat this up.
[17:50.98]The sugar and the spice is all over.
[17:53.00]It shouldn't be a problem, I don't think, right?
[18:00.38]I'm cleaning the stove under your blood.
[18:01.46]Alright.
[18:05.17]You could have just turned the stove top off to do that.
[18:07.75]That is fine.
[18:09.86]So pumpkin pie is made not with the guts, it's made with the actual pumpkin.
[18:14.83]I guess.
[18:15.51]That's news to me.
[18:16.39]Yeah, I thought it was like the guts.
[18:19.93]Oh my god.
[18:20.53]That's what I thought it was.
[18:21.33]What the fuck?
[18:23.03]Please be careful.
[18:27.58]Wow.
[18:28.86]Why are these pumpkins so hard?
[18:30.84]Your hands could be a little jelly too.
[18:36.66]That was actually pretty cool.
[18:37.62]Did you see that?
[18:38.10]That was very primal.
[18:38.98]I'm not gonna be able to do that.
[18:40.18]No, you just gotta rip it in half.
[18:41.66]Rip it in half?
[18:42.14]Yeah, just take it and... It's not gonna happen.
[18:50.23]I mean, actually, I have to be as cool as you.
[18:51.69]Hold on.
[18:52.23]Yeah, yeah, maybe a little incision.
[18:54.78]There you go.
[18:55.24]You just gotta get it started a bit.
[18:56.84]Okay, so now cut the cameras and cut back and... Okay, ready?
[19:01.34]Yeah.
[19:01.72]So we're gonna edit this part, right?
[19:03.74]It'll be edited out.
[19:04.46]Okay.
[19:05.44]Oh, dude, let me try that too, man.
[19:07.44]Alright.
[19:08.12]I got to be able to do that too.
[19:09.16]Let's go.
[19:16.11]Cut that for a second here.
[19:17.15]Let's get it.
[19:18.61]It smells.
[19:19.05]Dude, the sugar is burning.
[19:20.77]No, no, no, no, no.
[19:21.49]It smells like cotton candy in here.
[19:26.24]It smells like a fucking carnival.
[19:28.11]That's what stovetops usually smell like.
[19:30.79]Okay, so, man, you just pulled that apart.
[19:32.49]That was pretty cool, dude.
[19:33.69]You pulled that apart.
[19:34.33]Let me give that a try.
[19:39.25]You just got to get the right leverage.
[19:43.67]Oh, my Lord.
[19:45.17]Hercules.
[19:46.71]First try, too.
[19:48.46]You made that look effortless.
[19:49.56]Mine was thicker than yours, I think.
[19:51.56]No, yeah, you got the bigger pumpkin.
[19:57.37]No, they're not.
[19:58.73]They're not.
[19:59.07]These knives look cool, but I don't think they're, they're not that sharp.
[20:01.41]They're not.
[20:02.11]And let's get them out of the way before anybody gets hurt.
[20:07.21]You can hear the ocean.
[20:17.55]Wasn't as clean as mine, but it's OK.
[20:19.27]Yeah, I was just going for a little part.
[20:20.57]Would you say this is mashed by any chance?
[20:25.20]No, this is not mashed.
[20:28.02]This is like somebody threw it at us.
[20:30.10]Alright, let me wash my hands and dry them.
[20:32.28]I will cut these.
[20:33.10]OK, yeah, yeah.
[20:34.76]I'll keep manhandling the pumpkin bits.
[20:41.55]Holy shit.
[20:48.15]Okay, there we go.
[20:48.95]Make sure it's a clean environment.
[20:52.21]So these need to be, the skin has to come off, right?
[20:55.12]No, the skin stays on.
[20:56.06]The skin stays on?
[20:56.80]Yes.
[20:58.10]You haven't been shocked recently, have you?
[20:59.98]No.
[21:00.62]I think I messed something up when I moved it over.
[21:04.04]Anything that uses a knife, give it to me.
[21:08.80]You're starting pretty well here.
[21:09.88]Yeah, I'm looking good on my side.
[21:24.94]You could try hitting it with that if you want.
[21:26.65]What's it?
[21:26.93]In a tan box.
[21:38.91]There's got to be, this is the 21st century.
[21:42.07]There's got to be a way.
[21:43.75]This is in like a case.
[21:46.47]Oh no, that's a good knife.
[21:47.32]You're going to want that one.
[21:52.29]Oh, yeah.
[21:52.99]Actually, let me get the old cleaver there.
[21:55.37]I don't think I want you to touch these.
[21:57.77]Well, it'll be fine.
[21:58.99]You have an electrocution device on your arm.
[22:01.01]I haven't been shocked in a minute, though.
[22:02.47]These are in a case.
[22:03.77]Yeah.
[22:04.21]That could be bad.
[22:05.19]No, it should be fine.
[22:07.27]I haven't been shocked in like 10 minutes.
[22:25.65]That was even like really cool ambient noise.
[22:28.39]Just the sound of Jerma's footsteps.
[22:30.15]Dude, I think that was in my underwear.
[22:32.69]That was like, that fell down my pants.
[22:38.08]I'm going to put this back on.
[22:41.40]Oh my God.
[22:42.76]There's, there's no way.
[22:53.46]Okay.
[22:54.38]Jesus.
[22:55.70]Jesus.
[22:58.10]Okay, is that better?
[22:59.92]Okay.
[23:00.86]Do we have... Give me... Yeah, give it a... There's got to be something else you can do besides cutting.
[23:07.92]What's next on the list?
[23:09.34]I have to wait.
[23:10.20]Two large eggs beaten.
[23:12.12]That's easy.
[23:12.54]I can do that, right?
[23:13.16]You can do that.
[23:13.62]But I would wait to do that until the pumpkins are boiled.
[23:17.08]Oh, okay.
[23:17.72]Well, the water's not close yet.
[23:18.82]Oh.
[23:20.91]It's got orange in here.
[23:23.79]Alright, I'm going to be very safe with this.
[23:25.41]I'm very serious about this because this is equipment that could hurt.
[23:29.98]Oh, yes.
[23:32.06]This equipment could hurt.
[23:36.22]God, fucking damn it.
[23:38.18]You've got to be kidding me.
[23:39.89]All over the Cosmic Brownie.
[23:42.53]Oh, you've ruined our treats for everyone, though.
[23:44.61]Oh, this is actually kind of a disaster.
[23:51.57]That tastes fresh.
[23:55.23]How's the mashing?
[23:58.85]How small should the chunks be?
[24:01.47]I'd say, like, about this size.
[24:03.83]OK, so that's easy.
[24:12.09]Doing great, Matt.
[24:13.27]There's one thing I'm going to make sure I do not fuck around with a knife like this, you know what I mean?
[24:18.11]You see the problem I was having?
[24:19.93]Yeah, it gets thick, but you just got to be careful with it.
[24:23.59]That was scary lighting.
[24:27.28]Oh, the bowl's blocking your procedure here.
[24:33.33]I moved it.
[24:34.23]Honestly, I feel much safer just cavemanning it like this.
[24:37.61]Oh, wow!
[24:38.55]Yeah, I don't want to use the knife.
[24:40.03]Knives are fucking weird.
[24:44.66]Okay, I'm scared now, so we're just going to go like this.
[24:53.65]Not even fucking scary, dude.
[24:56.95]You're like a surgeon out here with this.
[24:58.73]This is the longest part of the whole thing.
[25:04.53]Yeah, the carving or the cutting of the pumpkin is a lot more difficult than I thought it would be.
[25:10.51]I want to go home.
[25:13.10]You can't give up in this kitchen.
[25:14.14]You can't go home.
[25:16.14]Alright, so I got some chunks here.
[25:20.44]How many chunks do you think we need?
[25:22.01]We don't have to follow the recipe.
[25:23.51]How many one inch chunks of pumpkin do you think?
[25:26.03]Oh, I just broke the salt glass.
[25:28.37]No.
[25:29.03]Are you okay?
[25:29.83]Yeah.
[25:30.61]I'm coming.
[25:33.25]Where?
[25:35.03]Oh, it actually is broken.
[25:36.43]Yeah.
[25:37.39]Oh, that's not good.
[25:38.35]I took the legs out from under it.
[25:39.77]Oh, and it's broken glass.
[25:42.04]And it's very... Yeah.
[25:45.60]Okay.
[25:45.76]Oh, that's...
[25:48.65]Yeah, that's broken.
[25:49.83]I hope this recipe didn't call for any salt.
[26:03.09]I can see in the dark.
[26:04.51]No, we're good for now.
[26:05.47]I can see in the dark.
[26:06.11]Let me just get the space.
[26:08.19]My eyes adjust pretty quickly.
[26:11.65]Oh, wait a minute.
[26:15.69]It's so dark in here.
[26:20.33]I think I've got the right stuff.
[26:21.47]Do you have the right stuff?
[26:22.27]I don't want to eat glass salt.
[26:24.46]No, no, no.
[26:26.54]There will be no glass in here.
[26:31.14]We need the night vision goggles.
[26:32.58]I got you.
[26:35.00]It's actually not as dark in here as it usually is with the lights off.
[26:37.99]Oh, yeah.
[26:40.51]Do you need the night vision for the glass?
[26:41.87]Because I can kind of man mode my way through this.
[26:43.87]Yeah, be careful back there.
[26:49.73]You know what?
[26:50.47]I can't think of a more safe routine than using a sharp knife and cutting a pumpkin with night vision goggles on.
[26:56.54]There's got to be nothing safer.
[26:58.30]Oh, here we go.
[26:58.74]Alright.
[27:00.10]I've set mine up for the next time that happens.
[27:02.00]How do you put these on?
[27:04.55]I'm going to keep them right here.
[27:10.48]Okay.
[27:10.86]Alright.
[27:11.28]Perfect.
[27:11.62]I'm good.
[27:13.02]Alright.
[27:14.52]So how many one inch chunks do you think we need?
[27:16.78]I'd say like six.
[27:17.40]Six?
[27:17.72]I would say the entire two pumpkins you should be cutting up into one inch chunks.
[27:24.32]Why is this taking like so long?
[27:26.86]There's a bigger knife in there if you want.
[27:29.68]Yeah.
[27:29.90]I'm going to grab the cleaver here.
[27:31.26]I'm going to give you some help.
[27:35.82]Be careful.
[27:36.38]Seriously.
[27:36.88]That thing is sharp.
[27:39.14]I can handle it.
[27:39.86]Be careful.
[27:40.82]It's not my first rodeo.
[27:42.14]Okay, so that looks alright.
[27:45.67]Jesus.
[27:47.49]I almost got half this one done, so it shouldn't be too bad.
[27:52.25]That actually might be a good way to do it, but just move your hand.
[27:55.06]Yeah.
[27:55.56]Oh, my God.
[27:56.00]Do all of it like that.
[28:00.10]I'm telling you, the caveman routine's better.
[28:02.28]Yeah, the more you just turn your brain off, the better the cooking turns out.
[28:08.32]So, yeah, I'm going to let you do that.
[28:15.25]It's going on the floor.
[28:18.59]Yeah, I'm using a little too much mustard on these.
[28:20.93]Oh, dude, what's in here?
[28:22.26]Oh, my God, it smells so good.
[28:25.32]Can we start just like...
[28:29.79]What are you worried about?
[28:30.59]It's just water.
[28:32.33]It hit me right in the forehead.
[28:37.37]I'm going to have like a red burn here.
[28:39.17]I'm stepping back.
[28:43.77]We're making good time on the pumpkin pie.
[28:45.69]Dude, you just don't.
[28:46.92]This is like, I would not want to eat at this restaurant.
[28:53.58]God.
[28:59.14]Okay, what can I do?
[29:01.15]Don't let me have all the fun.
[29:02.07]Start throwing some pumpkin chunks in.
[29:03.95]Okay, sure.
[29:05.25]What's happening?
[29:06.29]You're burning me.
[29:10.85]Ow!
[29:11.29]Ow!
[29:11.67]Oh, is it working?
[29:13.33]Yeah, that time it worked.
[29:15.69]Was it just, like, turned off?
[29:17.57]Yeah, it wasn't connected to the stream.
[29:20.11]Oh, gotcha, gotcha.
[29:23.07]Ow!
[29:24.81]Ouch!
[29:26.92]I feel like Sims.
[29:30.36]Ow!
[29:30.98]Ouch!
[29:38.03]Oh, I'll roll the sleeves up so you can actually see.
[29:39.97]Are you donating blood?
[29:41.23]What is all this shit in your arms?
[29:42.71]So the contacts are like, they have to be right on your skin for it to work, but I have really hairy arms, so I have to tape it down.
[29:49.99]I'll roll up my sleeves so you can actually see it.
[29:51.71]Remember, guys, exclamation point, blood.
[29:53.65]To draw blood from Charlie's arm.
[29:55.57]That'd be so hype.
[29:57.53]Is this like a blood tag?
[30:00.45]Chat gets to figure out how many pints of blood I donate during a stream.
[30:05.64]Here you go.
[30:06.22]Happy Halloween, you motherfucker.
[30:09.15]Don't be shy, throw it in.
[30:10.11]No, don't.
[30:11.87]Don't, should I put this in?
[30:14.53]Oh, gross, ew.
[30:19.35]How long do you boil this for?
[30:20.41]About 30 minutes.
[30:22.23]30 minutes?
[30:22.41]What the fuck?
[30:22.86]You're going to the next, you're doing the egg salad after.
[30:27.10]That's why we're doing the pumpkin pie first.
[30:28.46]You have to boil it, that's why we're doing that.
[30:31.18]Okay, okay.
[30:33.92]Egg salad, I heard it's pretty good.
[30:35.62]Yeah, do you want to do it?
[30:38.55]Yeah, I'll finish butchering the pumpkin here.
[30:42.17]God, Jesus.
[30:43.95]I'll start or finish this.
[30:45.31]You can start on the egg salad.
[30:46.41]Alright.
[30:46.67]Well, I've got to tell you, this area is a little contaminated, so the egg salad might not be as 10 out of 10 as it could be.
[30:52.43]Oh, I find that hard to believe.
[30:53.69]That egg salad's going to slap.
[30:56.53]It does taste very good.
[30:59.49]So for those of you watching that don't have any idea what we're talking about,
[31:02.67]I have a secret family egg salad recipe that is only getting passed down to my grandparents.
[31:10.06]It's only getting passed down to my family, but I'm going to share it with you a little bit today.
[31:14.74]It's a little bit of a twist on the egg salad that you might know.
[31:19.26]First, you start with 12 eggs, which I think we have in here, right?
[31:22.44]Yeah, there's also some here if you want to use these bad girls.
[31:25.14]It doesn't have to be 12.
[31:26.38]It has to be at least six.
[31:28.67]I think there's a full 12 in here.
[31:29.59]Is there a 12 here?
[31:30.45]Yeah.
[31:31.48]Do we have a pan that's as big that can hold this?
[31:33.94]Yeah, there's a lot of pans in this drawer right here.
[31:38.16]OK.
[31:41.72]This will be alright.
[31:43.50]Can this work?
[31:44.68]Yeah.
[31:46.08]OK.
[31:47.66]And where's your filter, your filtered water?
[31:52.01]Yeah, where's our filtered water?
[31:54.01]You don't have filtered water.
[31:59.76]I mean, I only use filtered water when I make this.
[32:02.36]It's important.
[32:03.40]You can try the fridge water.
[32:04.54]It's probably filtered.
[32:06.80]We had a big water leak here.
[32:08.42]It's alright.
[32:09.10]It's alright.
[32:10.14]No, it's OK.
[32:10.46]I'll use the tap.
[32:13.11]I'll use the tap.
[32:15.09]So you want to fill up a bowl to at least to a point where Charlie doesn't cut his arm off with a knife.
[32:24.55]I'm not getting shocked nearly as hard as I thought I would, though.
[32:26.95]You are going to boil.
[32:28.07]This kind of hurts.
[32:30.07]I'm doing, like, my, like, egg routine, and you're, like, dying over here.
[32:33.11]Oh, I'm good.
[32:36.03]Are you sure we need two pumpkins, though?
[32:37.57]Like, it's getting... There's a lot of activity.
[32:44.52]Alright.
[32:44.92]I'll let these guys get to know each other in here.
[32:47.80]Okay.
[32:49.26]Enough water.
[32:49.64]You don't want it to boil over.
[32:50.66]Heaven forbid it boils over, right?
[32:53.24]Well, we wouldn't want any disasters in the kitchen.
[32:55.90]How... There's hair in here.
[32:59.88]How's the what?
[33:00.82]There's a hair in here.
[33:03.26]Whose hair is that?
[33:04.36]It's from the Three Graces.
[33:05.70]When you cut it, somebody will die.
[33:07.66]What in the fuck is this?
[33:08.56]Is there a dog in here?
[33:09.52]Yeah, this is definitely my husky's hair.
[33:15.21]Alright.
[33:16.11]So let's scoop this out of the way.
[33:18.91]I'm going to clean this area because I don't want to.
[33:20.67]It's very hot, right?
[33:21.97]Yeah.
[33:24.32]And what you're going to do is you're going to boil these 12 eggs.
[33:27.48]You're boiling for 12 minutes.
[33:30.48]Is this hot?
[33:31.96]No, I can turn it on if you want.
[33:32.80]You want that one hot?
[33:33.36]Is this one hot or this one is hot, though?
[33:35.40]No, none of them are hot.
[33:36.30]Just this one.
[33:37.20]Why is this light on?
[33:39.18]Oh, good question.
[33:40.14]What is... I think that's for this one.
[33:42.10]Oh, no, it's just hot surface.
[33:43.51]I'll test it.
[33:44.49]Oh!
[33:45.01]No, it's not on.
[33:45.41]Alright, so let's go ahead and go like this because we want to make sure we've got a nice, clean surface.
[33:50.63]Oh, nice.
[33:51.41]Green is fine because it actually makes it taste better.
[33:54.08]Okay, let that boil.
[33:55.06]Okay.
[33:56.00]And you're going to put the eggs in when it starts to boil.
[33:59.02]At 12 minutes, you're boiling these eggs for 12 minutes.
[34:01.58]Anything less than that, you're a fucking idiot.
[34:03.76]Anything more than that, you're a stupid asshole.
[34:05.91]So 12 minutes, and then it goes immediately off, and you drain the water, and you take the eggs out and put them into a cold bath.
[34:11.33]You have any ice water?
[34:12.33]Yes, we can do that.
[34:13.31]Okay.
[34:15.45]I didn't move to get it, but we can absolutely do that.
[34:19.73]Okay.
[34:21.39]You got ice?
[34:26.56]Oh, it's in the door.
[34:27.20]Right, right, right.
[34:27.88]Okay.
[34:28.46]Cube dice.
[34:29.26]I need a bowl.
[34:30.58]That's making sounds.
[34:32.16]You can probably turn that down to simmer, Trevor.
[34:40.20]Simmer?
[34:40.36]And then cover it with a lid.
[34:41.14]Alright.
[34:41.36]This'll do.
[34:43.38]I'll look for a lid.
[34:45.56]So while our pumpkin pie filling is boiling... Is this right?
[34:50.24]This feels like glass.
[34:51.08]Won't that just break?
[34:52.52]No.
[34:52.64]No, you're good.
[34:53.10]Yeah, you can cover it.
[34:53.94]But actually, it's going to boil over.
[34:55.02]There's a lot of water in there, so we have to be careful.
[34:56.68]It's going to boil over.
[34:58.65]Is there a hole in here?
[34:59.73]Nope.
[34:59.89]Is there a hole in the lid?
[35:01.51]Nope.
[35:02.09]If you cover that, it's going to go like like a cartoon.
[35:05.55]Well, let's see.
[35:08.44]Okay, but you angled it, so that's better.
[35:12.18]You angled it.
[35:12.90]If it's all the way down, then you're going to get the cartoon bubbling.
[35:15.84]Alright.
[35:16.04]Alright, we'll just leave it like that then.
[35:17.78]They can have some fun in there at the pool.
[35:19.68]By the way, I have to say, Charlie, nice shoes.
[35:21.92]Thank you.
[35:22.76]Yeah, so Jerma also wears Skechers.
[35:28.28]I'm telling you, this is going to boil up.
[35:33.00]Charlie, do you have insurance?
[35:34.86]We don't need that where we're going.
[35:41.97]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[35:46.49]Ice water, remember.
[35:51.63]Not this one?
[35:55.94]I won't burn myself.
[35:59.82]That looks good.
[36:01.58]What are you doing?
[36:02.40]I'm cooking.
[36:04.76]You're scooping water out with like a thermos?
[36:07.14]Yep.
[36:07.98]I don't know what I was thinking.
[36:09.18]I'm not going to lie to you.
[36:12.27]We don't have to eat this, right?
[36:13.51]Like, this is just a joke.
[36:14.55]We're making this for a funny routine.
[36:15.85]This is going to be a great pumpkin pie.
[36:17.18]No one's eating that, right?
[36:18.24]No, it's going to be a great pumpkin pie, trust me.
[36:20.40]Alright, I've got my ice water here.
[36:22.10]I've got my ice, but I'm going to be ready.
[36:25.02]Okay, that's probably enough.
[36:27.34]I didn't even take any water.
[36:31.46]I tell that to my fingers.
[36:32.52]This is like a magic potion.
[36:35.21]Ooh, it's like steamy.
[36:38.69]Let me help you here.
[36:39.69]Oh, God, good luck.
[36:44.13]That was good.
[36:53.01]Oh, that was a good one.
[36:53.67]That was a good scoop.
[36:54.45]That was a good scoop.
[36:58.13]Oh, I just thought of something.
[36:59.33]Why don't we?
[37:00.83]I think that's OK.
[37:01.59]You think that's enough?
[37:02.27]That should be alright.
[37:02.95]OK.
[37:05.31]Cool, huh?
[37:05.89]Yeah, you just set that down.
[37:08.29]Alright, so we've got to wait for this to boil.
[37:10.67]Because this has boiled for 30 minutes.
[37:12.47]How long has it been?
[37:20.11]I just got, like, smoked out.
[37:22.57]Let's let it boil with the lid off a little bit.
[37:24.55]Yeah, maybe just let it... Okay, so is this on?
[37:26.85]Keep to itself.
[37:28.01]Yes.
[37:28.61]Is it?
[37:29.63]I don't know.
[37:30.39]I don't think this is turned on.
[37:32.93]Maybe I'll just crank that up to max.
[37:34.02]Yeah, crank it up to hot.
[37:37.44]Oh, I just turned it off.
[37:38.76]I told you I was coming on to do my egg salad recipe, and this is the environment that I didn't want to be in.
[37:44.08]No, hold on.
[37:44.88]We've got a good environment here.
[37:48.57]So let me get some ice water in here.
[37:49.89]OK, that's not working.
[37:54.21]Remember, if you boil these eggs for more than 12 minutes, you're not invited to my fucking party this year.
[38:07.28]God.
[38:08.33]Damn it.
[38:09.61]How does this work?
[38:11.95]Is it on?
[38:12.99]Be careful.
[38:13.57]Let's see.
[38:16.29]I think it is hot.
[38:16.93]We need like a touch chef in here, like Wubby.
[38:19.34]Fucking put his whole hand on it.
[38:20.28]Put his hand on stuff.
[38:21.96]Yeah, this is going to be very hot, so.
[38:25.84]That's smelling good, though.
[38:26.74]That does actually smell pretty good.
[38:28.22]I mean, some of it was on the floor, but it does smell okay.
[38:31.67]And I've got my cosmic brownies.
[38:34.27]This is definitely on.
[38:36.11]Yeah, it's just going to take a while.
[38:37.15]Yeah, it's a big pot.
[38:38.71]Annoying fucking cooking is so annoying.
[38:41.01]Just have to sit here and watch shit boil.
[38:42.34]It's stupid.
[38:44.10]It is dumb.
[38:45.04]So what do we need for your egg salad?
[38:46.08]What else?
[38:47.60]Well, we need to see.
[38:49.00]We'll get your night vision goggles on first.
[38:50.42]We need to be able to see.
[38:51.32]Yeah.
[38:54.70]Okay, so these go on like this.
[38:57.48]Nope, that burner is not on.
[38:59.60]I know that because... That burner is not on?
[39:01.05]Yeah, I know that because my night vision goggles are infrared right now, so I can see this is on.
[39:05.97]That's not on.
[39:06.73]It's not turned on?
[39:08.49]Do my batteries... Where's the power button?
[39:13.05]Top left.
[39:13.89]Top left?
[39:17.46]How do I turn... Oh, this is going to be scary.
[39:19.94]How do I turn that on?
[39:20.94]I don't think mine's charged.
[39:25.24]Can you see?
[39:25.68]Can you help me?
[39:26.50]Yeah, let me see.
[39:27.14]Where are you?
[39:28.74]I'm right here.
[39:31.04]Okay.
[39:31.16]Okay, so do you see the top left button?
[39:32.99]Yeah, here, I got you.
[39:33.87]It's right here.
[39:36.23]You on?
[39:36.89]No.
[39:39.03]I don't think these are charged.
[39:40.19]Oh, that might be the case.
[39:41.53]Oh, wait, hold on.
[39:42.27]You on?
[39:42.67]There it is.
[39:43.25]Turn wheel to focus.
[39:45.03]Oh, these are cool.
[39:46.26]Yeah, no, they're nice.
[39:47.00]Holy shit.
[39:47.84]Now you can see what I'm seeing, so that's definitely on.
[39:51.08]Yeah, no, that one is not on.
[39:52.82]Yeah, that is just not on.
[39:54.76]No, this is not turned on.
[39:56.02]Oh, wait, it's coming.
[39:57.20]Wait.
[39:58.76]It's like trying to start, but it won't.
[40:02.11]Is our oven charged?
[40:03.01]No.
[40:07.12]Did you plug this in with like a USB last night to let it go overnight and charge?
[40:10.98]No, like the actual stove on the top left burner is not working.
[40:14.84]Yeah, this doesn't work.
[40:18.07]Uh-oh.
[40:19.71]Look at how hot that is.
[40:20.79]This is crazy.
[40:21.57]That's like super steamy.
[40:22.55]Yeah, this is like actual volcanic level magma.
[40:25.57]That's just not on.
[40:26.77]Let's try a different burner.
[40:28.29]Yeah, is there another burner?
[40:29.59]I love how this turns our FOV into like 40 FOV.
[40:32.45]Oh, this one's on.
[40:34.26]Oh, yep.
[40:34.64]There, I can see the heat on that one.
[40:35.80]Alright.
[40:36.52]Be very careful there.
[40:40.46]It's 30 FOV.
[40:42.57]Oh, nice.
[40:43.03]I think you're on it.
[40:43.65]I think I got it.
[40:46.49]Yeah.
[40:46.75]This is so weird.
[40:49.89]Alright.
[40:50.53]What's next in the egg salad?
[40:51.79]The egg salad.
[40:52.53]We need to boil.
[40:53.05]The bar of water needs to boil.
[40:55.57]That's the problem.
[40:56.47]Well, do you want to use the pumpkin water?
[40:58.03]I mean, we can just make room in there.
[40:59.75]I mean, if you want to ruin my family egg salad recipe and make me look bad, then... When you say it like that, alright, well, we don't have to use that.
[41:06.52]Do we have a timer for how long this has been on here?
[41:08.62]Oh, it's up here in the old noodle.
[41:10.72]I feel like I'm like a FPS.
[41:13.36]Like, I want to put my hands up here and just start punching you.
[41:15.68]I know.
[41:16.26]It's cool, isn't it?
[41:16.92]Yeah, put your hands like this and get them in frame so they look like first person.
[41:19.46]Holy shit.
[41:20.17]That's so cool.
[41:23.26]This is actually wild.
[41:24.56]That's cool.
[41:26.19]Yeah, I feel like it's like being in VR for the first time ever.
[41:28.79]Shake my hand.
[41:29.81]Okay, let's try to shake hands.
[41:33.23]Yeah!
[41:36.99]Alright.
[41:37.79]Okay, so we need that water to boil.
[41:39.53]Yep.
[41:41.03]Hey, man, cooking, man.
[41:42.35]Cooking half the time is just waiting for water to boil.
[41:44.13]You know what I'm saying?
[41:45.41]Where's that little boat torch?
[41:46.39]Maybe we can get it on top.
[41:48.13]Are the lights on?
[41:48.67]We can see again.
[41:50.15]I can feel that.
[41:51.65]We can maybe, like, speed up the process.
[41:55.01]We could speed the process up if you had a water boiler.
[41:58.33]Oh, true.
[41:59.43]That would be sick.
[41:59.99]We need to get one of those.
[42:02.65]All the smoke's unclogging.
[42:04.23]I have a lot of pumpkin over here.
[42:05.29]I don't know what to do with it.
[42:05.99]We need to get rid of this.
[42:08.21]Yeah, you can just throw it away if you want.
[42:10.05]Oh.
[42:10.77]Here.
[42:11.79]We don't need all of it.
[42:12.96]Oh.
[42:13.14]I don't know.
[42:14.66]Throw it away.
[42:16.12]Okay.
[42:17.54]Well, you don't have to if you want to.
[42:19.30]Well, you do it.
[42:20.49]I don't want to do it.
[42:21.09]I feel bad.
[42:21.53]I don't want to do it either.
[42:23.03]Just keep it on the table.
[42:23.77]Let's keep it on the table.
[42:24.33]It's not hurting anyone.
[42:25.09]It's OK.
[42:25.33]You know it's the sound that's more scary to me than the actual thing.
[42:32.30]I know.
[42:32.50]There's no powder in there anymore.
[42:33.78]So now it's just air, and it's still scary.
[42:35.74]Am I falling again?
[42:39.04]What keeps happening?
[42:42.24]You've been snapped all the way in.
[42:45.78]Yeah, I think I'm just a weirdo.
[42:46.78]I move around too much.
[42:49.69]Alright, so while the water boils, we can share a cosmic brownie.
[42:56.52]I'm down.
[42:57.14]Just kidding.
[42:57.68]I'm not sharing it with anybody.
[43:00.10]Oh, actually, we could, while that's boiling, make spooky spaghetti and eyeballs.
[43:04.83]I think we need the burners for that, though.
[43:07.17]We need to cook pasta.
[43:09.53]Oh, you're right.
[43:10.93]We need to cook pasta.
[43:11.70]You can start making meatballs.
[43:13.27]We could make the meatballs.
[43:14.39]Yeah, let's do that.
[43:15.53]We need to clean the area, though.
[43:16.59]This is, I mean, like, if there was a chef here right now, we would both get slapped.
[43:21.87]I agree.
[43:22.97]I'll move my evaporated milk.
[43:26.15]Okay, let me, I'm going to wash this, because, like, come on, man.
[43:28.94]Come on, Gwyn.
[43:32.80]We have to at least be somewhat professional, for the love of God.
[43:36.22]This one seems really easy, so we just need a large bowl, and we mix some ground beef.
[43:42.58]Yeah, this shouldn't be a problem.
[43:44.60]Yeah, we can do that.
[43:47.96]That's alright right here.
[43:49.58]Clean as you go, right?
[43:50.60]We're making like three meals.
[43:52.64]We're going to have so much shit everywhere.
[43:54.04]No, it's because we're feeding the whole family.
[43:55.71]Yeah, all of you have to eat this.
[44:06.23]It's going to come out really well, I think, honestly.
[44:08.55]Especially your egg salad.
[44:10.29]No, I'm looking forward to having people eat that.
[44:16.90]Alright, I got the ground beef.
[44:18.62]So we need to, let's get a, do we have like another area we can put that to not cause contaminate?
[44:24.14]It's important to not put meat, you know, together with other stuff.
[44:27.46]That's what I was thinking.
[44:29.18]And I noticed that you haven't, you didn't, you came out of the bathroom like two hours ago and you didn't wash your hands.
[44:33.95]Nope.
[44:34.39]And I didn't say anything, but you should before touching that.
[44:39.21]Didn't even touch it.
[44:39.87]OK.
[44:40.85]That's alright.
[44:41.24]That was a smooth slop and plop.
[44:43.20]You still should wash your hands, though, because it was gross.
[44:45.08]No, no, no.
[44:45.42]I came out of the bathroom without washing my hands.
[44:47.60]It was like, I don't know.
[44:48.42]I was kind of off.
[44:48.96]The man has one egg salad recipe and thinks he owns the whole kitchen.
[44:52.02]I just don't want to make a big deal out of it, but it was just bizarre.
[44:57.67]OK, so we need to make these into little balls, right?
[45:02.57]Little balls?
[45:03.25]This big?
[45:03.91]Like this big around?
[45:05.67]Do you like big meatballs or small meatballs?
[45:07.49]Let's do, like, cocktail-sized meatballs since we're feeding so many.
[45:11.01]Okay, so I'm thinking, like... What?
[45:16.14]We're about to, Chelsea, if you just calm down.
[45:18.44]Just plain ground beef.
[45:21.08]Alright, well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[45:22.54]What is that?
[45:24.58]That's just old pizza seasoning.
[45:26.74]Pizza seasoning?
[45:27.70]Meatball?
[45:28.38]Well, that's not what I wanted to grab, but that's alright.
[45:30.86]Alright.
[45:31.76]How would you... I'm imagining salt, pepper, oregano.
[45:35.32]Don't imagine salt anymore.
[45:36.58]That ship is sailed.
[45:37.38]Oh, that's right.
[45:38.02]The glass broke.
[45:38.69]Okay.
[45:39.13]How about pepper, oregano?
[45:41.45]What do you put in meatballs?
[45:42.89]Rosemary, maybe?
[45:43.93]Rosemary.
[45:44.31]You can just throw whatever you want here.
[45:45.35]It should be fine.
[45:45.93]Yeah.
[45:46.21]And I'm going to... I just washed my hands, unlike you.
[45:49.21]I just washed them.
[45:49.83]Don't worry.
[45:53.36]Now, what is this?
[45:53.82]Is this thyme?
[45:54.59]This is rosemary.
[45:55.57]So this is rosemary.
[45:56.39]Okay, don't put too much because rosemary overpowers everything else in the dish.
[45:59.69]I agree.
[46:00.15]That's why I just did a pinch.
[46:01.39]This is a pinch.
[46:03.11]I'm going to meld this together.
[46:04.93]Okay.
[46:06.55]And then if you get some other ingredients you'd like to put in here, please do.
[46:09.24]Yeah, I'm going to top it off with a little extra meat.
[46:15.60]Do you put Parmesan cheese in these?
[46:17.76]Because that's pretty sick.
[46:19.04]That goes kind of hard, actually.
[46:20.30]We have so much Parm.
[46:22.72]We're making a lot of meatballs, apparently.
[46:25.42]Okay.
[46:25.86]Alright.
[46:26.40]So we're going to mix this together.
[46:28.60]I'm going to do it by hand.
[46:30.36]I'm going to get the seasoning and come in there and help you.
[46:32.25]Yeah, dump the seasoning in here whenever you want to go for it.
[46:34.73]Do you think I should add some chocolate powder?
[46:38.85]Yeah.
[46:39.43]Alright.
[46:43.81]Where's the cumin junk?
[46:48.81]I don't know if he puts that in his... Oh, he actually has it in his can.
[46:55.17]I thought that was like a, yeah, you know what I mean?
[46:57.03]Like, yeah, sure.
[46:57.69]I just, raw meat got near my face.
[47:01.44]I need to go to the hospital.
[47:03.32]Raw meat got right near my face.
[47:04.48]I have to go to the hospital.
[47:05.72]That's how I react to raw meat as well.
[47:08.14]This is just... What is in here?
[47:09.66]That's ginger.
[47:11.12]Oh, what are you doing?
[47:11.98]You're putting ginger?
[47:14.18]It's ginger.
[47:15.49]Yeah.
[47:16.39]Oh, it's ruined now.
[47:17.43]Nobody's going to eat this.
[47:19.81]I disagree.
[47:23.26]What are we making?
[47:24.12]That's on the recipe.
[47:26.02]We need salt.
[47:26.84]We need pepper.
[47:27.50]We need oregano.
[47:29.46]Okay.
[47:30.51]That's pepper.
[47:31.05]I need you to do that one more time.
[47:33.11]Flip it over.
[47:33.99]Let me get that posterior.
[47:35.57]Go ahead.
[47:37.19]Okay, I think that's pretty good.
[47:39.07]The TENS unit is definitely working, but it's only- Have you just gotten used to it by now?
[47:43.82]Yeah, I think I've just been conditioned now, because when I was doing this off before today, it had my whole arm coming back.
[47:50.61]I think now I'm just built for the tolerance.
[47:52.85]You can try turning it up if you want, but I wouldn't go to 200 because then my heart might misfire.
[48:07.57]I just get to start spinning it up here.
[48:09.62]I throw it up into like the crew.
[48:11.54]Alright, so you put ginger in here and ruined the recipe.
[48:16.70]Oh, it's on the recipe.
[48:17.84]Garlic, salt, pepper, ginger.
[48:19.85]What?
[48:20.43]Yep.
[48:22.59]Garlic, salt, pepper, ginger.
[48:24.41]It is?
[48:24.91]Yep.
[48:26.46]What?
[48:27.28]It's the spooky... Jesus, ow.
[48:30.22]That didn't even make it more extreme.
[48:31.53]It just hurt more.
[48:31.97]Dude, I don't think this is on.
[48:34.05]It is absolutely on.
[48:35.03]Dude, it's not doing anything.
[48:36.27]It doesn't... What is happening with this water?
[48:38.09]I checked it on the infrared.
[48:39.11]It's taking two hours to boil the water.
[48:43.05]The infrared did say it was on.
[48:44.43]It did.
[48:45.21]It absolutely did.
[48:45.99]Alright, what's next after mixing in all these?
[48:48.52]So now place them into the baking dish.
[48:50.74]Okay, you're doing it in the baking dish.
[48:52.92]Okay, so we got one big-ass meatball.
[48:58.34]We can do a huge meatball.
[48:59.50]Dude, let's do a meatball brain.
[49:00.96]Are you serious?
[49:01.94]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[49:02.67]A meatball brain on the pasta.
[49:03.99]That's a great fucking idea.
[49:04.79]No fucking way.
[49:05.71]Okay, and then cheese.
[49:07.65]So we can do just like a giant meatball.
[49:09.97]I actually think that'd be really cool.
[49:12.31]I hope nobody cuts into the middle of this because it's not going to be ready.
[49:18.48]It's on there, right?
[49:19.08]It's underneath the seasoning.
[49:20.00]Underneath the seasoning.
[49:24.41]It's the spooky spaghetti and eyeballs.
[49:25.88]Take it up with the persnickety.
[49:29.60]We're looking at it back here.
[49:30.88]And it's not online.
[49:32.66]Oh, that's spooky.
[49:33.74]Show me yours.
[49:34.50]That's weird.
[49:35.20]Must have been a misprint.
[49:36.12]Let me see yours.
[49:37.12]It's right there.
[49:37.58]It's on it.
[49:38.26]Is it garlic that you're eating?
[49:40.12]Oh, yeah.
[49:40.32]It's right there.
[49:41.60]Ginger.
[49:41.86]How did you do that?
[49:44.21]So now we just need the baking dish.
[49:46.73]Dude, this is actually a pretty sick brain, I have to say.
[49:49.97]That's a pretty good brain so far.
[49:51.59]It needs a little bit more of a couple of hemispheres, right?
[49:56.16]Where's the baking dishes?
[49:58.32]Dude, it's going to sit on top of the pasta and it's going to gross out everybody at the party.
[50:01.67]It's going to be so funny.
[50:02.67]What are you using for it?
[50:03.49]No, I'm just saying.
[50:05.29]Oh, you're putting grooves.
[50:06.41]Yeah, because we need the hemispheres of the brain.
[50:08.25]Oh, smart, smart, smart.
[50:09.33]So this is going to sit on top of the pasta with the red sauce and everybody at the party is going to go, oh my God, it's a fucking brain.
[50:14.05]And I'm going to go, yeah, it's gross.
[50:16.79]And then no one's going to eat it because everyone avoids that shit at parties.
[50:20.63]Like no one's ever eaten like the weird like, oh, look, it's like witch fingers.
[50:23.43]Gross.
[50:23.71]Just give me fucking chicken fingers.
[50:24.81]Stop doing that.
[50:27.83]I can't find our baking dishes.
[50:32.47]What's the temperature to cook this?
[50:34.54]I have no idea.
[50:37.12]Let me come in here.
[50:39.90]Ah, here we go.
[50:42.53]Do you think your brain is this big?
[50:45.01]I don't know.
[50:45.63]How big is a normal brain?
[50:46.67]I feel like this is how big it could be, right?
[50:50.55]I think so.
[50:51.31]Did you put enough grooves, though?
[50:52.41]You need to get the frontal lobe and stuff.
[50:54.10]Do you have a scoring thing?
[50:55.38]I can score it.
[50:56.20]Oh, that's a good idea.
[50:57.06]I think we have some cool stuff you can imprint with it.
[50:59.82]Oh, look, you can use this.
[51:01.56]You do art and stuff, right?
[51:02.56]Yeah, I draw.
[51:03.86]So yeah, this should be your job.
[51:04.86]You're going to make the brain.
[51:06.80]Yeah, hold on.
[51:13.27]I don't think that's doing anything.
[51:14.41]It's not really imprinting the way I thought it would.
[51:17.43]Well, no, get it on here.
[51:18.33]We need some oil or cooking spray or something, right?
[51:22.73]I got my hands covered in raw meat.
[51:24.37]I got it.
[51:25.55]And then you can score it to make it look like a brain.
[51:27.09]And it's spaghetti and brain meatballs.
[51:34.16]Spaghetti and brain meatballs coming right up.
[51:36.70]Gross.
[51:37.40]Put it there.
[51:38.20]Alright, I got it.
[51:40.20]Oh my god.
[51:40.82]Alright.
[51:45.33]What does a normal brain look like, do you think?
[51:47.17]I could give it maybe like, I don't know, regions.
[51:55.42]Oh, this?
[51:56.00]Oh, I can't see anymore.
[51:59.38]I'm just going to stay over here.
[52:02.50]Because I don't know, I can't see anything.
[52:04.18]This brain is not going to look the right way, I don't think.
[52:08.61]Charlie, where are my, Charlie, where are the glasses?
[52:10.99]Hold on, I got this.
[52:12.13]Oh my God.
[52:12.41]Charlie, where are the glasses?
[52:14.03]I don't know where they are.
[52:14.63]I got you.
[52:14.93]Here, here, wait, wait.
[52:15.43]Oh my God.
[52:17.29]Charlie, quick.
[52:18.61]Over here?
[52:20.17]Oh my God.
[52:21.29]No, that's not it.
[52:22.11]He's blind without his night vision goggles.
[52:29.37]I've got bad news.
[52:30.29]That just blew my hair into the raw meat.
[52:32.64]Oh.
[52:32.98]That'll be really cool.
[52:34.86]Especially for my face.
[52:41.05]Tell me, Tom.
[52:44.27]This is the best this brain's going to get.
[52:46.01]I'm not going to lie to you.
[52:47.59]Yeah.
[52:48.03]I mean, it's probably good enough.
[52:49.94]Okay.
[52:50.42]Wait, that doesn't look like a brain.
[52:53.48]It is.
[52:53.82]They're suffering from Alzheimer's.
[52:55.44]I actually can't even see.
[52:56.78]Let me see.
[52:59.20]I gave it like a little... You just like cut it in half.
[53:02.32]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[53:04.04]So like when the neurons, like the connections start misfiring and there's like a little divide, that's kind of what I... It's like a car accident victim's brain.
[53:12.92]Oh.
[53:12.98]So right now it's like early onset dementia.
[53:15.53]Oh.
[53:16.87]Well, I...
[53:19.00]And then we just put it in the oven, I think.
[53:21.30]Is it ready for the oven?
[53:22.08]How long in the oven?
[53:24.22]Where's the paper?
[53:25.46]I don't think your pot heat is on.
[53:28.50]It is, though.
[53:29.22]I don't think so.
[53:30.30]You can come check.
[53:30.94]This whole side doesn't really work.
[53:34.15]I mean, the infrared does not show it.
[53:36.69]It comes on and off.
[53:38.79]See, it's going to come on and off.
[53:39.97]It pulsates.
[53:45.45]You closed your eyes, but now it's off now.
[53:47.53]Yeah, no, I saw it.
[53:48.49]I mean, maybe the egg salad recipe just can't happen today.
[53:50.83]Let me get this out of the way before somebody gets hurt.
[53:56.66]That's smelling good.
[53:57.58]It is.
[53:57.82]It's coming along.
[53:58.34]No, the pumpkin does smell really good.
[53:59.78]It smells pretty good.
[54:05.06]You're boiling the water.
[54:06.82]The water's boiling?
[54:07.74]No, you want to boil it.
[54:08.74]Oh, yes, I want to boil it, yeah.
[54:09.78]I'm just going to crank the heat up.
[54:10.87]Well, that's what I did.
[54:12.49]Just watch the burner, Matt.
[54:13.31]It goes on and off.
[54:15.28]I think it's out of battery, if that's how that works.
[54:17.30]This side is out of battery, I think.
[54:21.10]Because we have an electric stove.
[54:23.47]Batteries can be electric.
[54:24.57]Is the internet connection maybe spotty, perhaps?
[54:27.39]Yeah, this is through the Wi-Fi, right?
[54:28.87]Yeah.
[54:29.23]So you could be like, Alexa, turn on left stove burner.
[54:33.84]Is it on?
[54:34.52]No, it didn't work.
[54:35.56]That's weird.
[54:35.94]We're a Google Home, not Alexa.
[54:38.46]Oh.
[54:39.45]So this is just 20 minutes in the oven at 375.
[54:42.93]So this is at 400, though.
[54:43.97]Which means it'll be, we do the math, that'll be... It'll be faster, but we should probably reduce it.
[54:48.19]I can't see.
[54:48.63]300 for like six hours.
[54:51.77]Okay, there we go.
[54:52.49]So this is, we should probably put the heat down to like 350, 300.
[54:56.25]We're slow cooking a brain?
[54:59.19]What's happening here?
[54:59.67]400, you think?
[55:11.43]So 400, how long was it originally?
[55:13.09]20 minutes, but that's kind of hard.
[55:15.27]OK.
[55:15.33]We're going to have to check it.
[55:16.41]Yeah.
[55:16.77]We're going to have to check it.
[55:18.01]Oh, in the microwave.
[55:18.63]That's a good idea.
[55:19.27]Wait.
[55:19.45]Oh, that's the microwave.
[55:20.41]That's wrong.
[55:21.15]OK.
[55:21.97]It's in here.
[55:22.59]Yeah.
[55:23.09]OK.
[55:23.35]Be careful.
[55:23.76]It's hot.
[55:24.72]I've handled this before.
[55:26.00]And there's a timer on the oven, too, if you guys want to step back.
[55:30.92]OK.
[55:30.98]So we should probably put it for 20 minutes and check it?
[55:33.10]Yeah.
[55:33.82]Just come in there with a little knife or something to poke it around with?
[55:36.69]Uh-huh.
[55:37.53]OK.
[55:37.93]What?
[55:38.61]I don't understand.
[55:40.19]Timer.
[55:42.01]20 minutes.
[55:44.15]OK.
[55:45.23]And OK.
[55:48.65]20 minutes is on the clock here.
[55:49.69]In 20 minutes, we'll cut through that and see if it's looking good.
[55:52.33]You can take a break, too, so you guys can go put on your costumes.
[55:55.77]We have costumes.
[55:56.61]That works for me.
[55:57.41]Oh, we have to put costumes on.
[55:59.05]We're going to fix your tens unit, too.
[56:01.23]Is there something wrong with it?
[56:02.35]Or am I just too strong?
[56:03.10]I believe I put the leads in the wrong.
[56:04.80]Why am I doing that for you?
[56:07.34]I appreciated that, though.
[56:10.23]It's very sanitary right here.
[56:12.05]Oh, it's so funny.
[56:15.77]We'll be back in a minute.
[56:17.21]Before we go, let's be very clear what we've done in the meantime.
[56:20.21]Yes.
[56:20.29]We've boiled two pots of water.
[56:22.77]One pot.
[56:23.17]That one's still working on it.
[56:24.09]This one is not boiling yet, and that one just has pumpkin meat in it.
[56:27.17]So we're halfway there.
[56:28.37]We're doing pretty well.
[56:29.35]This show won't be done by midnight.
[56:31.07]We'll be here until, like, 5 in the morning.
[56:34.33]Okay, see you soon.
[56:35.59]I want to go maybe wash my hair, too, from the raw meat, if possible.
[56:46.56]Yay, we're back.
[56:47.38]Happy Halloween.
[56:49.30]We're in costume.
[56:50.38]I'm Mercy from the Overwatch 2.
[56:53.80]And who's that?
[56:54.98]Hey, how are you?
[56:55.82]It's me, Deadpool.
[56:56.82]Nice to see everybody.
[56:57.84]Oh my god, it's so good to have you here.
[56:59.46]Yeah, special guest here.
[57:01.18]You just missed Jerma.
[57:02.38]Did I?
[57:02.96]Yeah, he was a great guy.
[57:04.12]Aw, he's a fun dude.
[57:05.08]He's a fun dude.
[57:05.48]Kind of a weird guy.
[57:06.42]Kind of a weird guy.
[57:07.10]But I just missed him?
[57:08.18]You just missed him.
[57:09.06]Wow.
[57:09.40]So me and the Merc with the Mouth, let me tell you what I'm going to do today.
[57:12.02]I'm going to take, we're going to make pumpkin pie.
[57:13.83]That's what's going to happen here.
[57:15.48]So where do we start?
[57:16.64]I don't know, man.
[57:17.14]I just showed up.
[57:17.86]I just got the call.
[57:18.76]Yeah.
[57:19.58]They were like, hey, man, you want to be on Charlie's show?
[57:22.15]I'm like, I love that guy.
[57:23.19]Of course I'm going to be on that show.
[57:25.93]I knocked out that motherfucker in the parking lot, by the way.
[57:28.19]He looked at me weird.
[57:29.14]No, that sounds exactly what he deserved.
[57:30.56]I went like that to him.
[57:32.72]Show him your high kick.
[57:33.82]Yeah?
[57:34.68]I went like this.
[57:38.09]Oh my god.
[57:39.37]He didn't survive, did he?
[57:40.19]Yeah, so don't fuck with me.
[57:41.60]Ain't that the truth.
[57:43.00]Pumpkin pie though.
[57:44.12]Pumpkin pie.
[57:44.86]That's what I heard we were doing.
[57:45.74]That's what the person on the voicemail that they left me.
[57:47.74]So you get to mash these.
[57:49.90]Mashed potatoes?
[57:51.08]The pumpkin.
[57:51.72]You mean like this?
[57:54.91]Look at those puppies.
[57:56.15]OK.
[57:57.23]Don't want to put this right on the counter though.
[57:59.75]Oh, I see what you're getting at.
[58:02.91]Shouldn't do that.
[58:03.67]That's probably a bad idea.
[58:07.61]Hey, do you know Wolverine?
[58:08.93]Yeah, that guy's an asshole.
[58:10.35]That guy's such a dick.
[58:12.89]I fought him one time over the last slice of pizza once.
[58:16.37]You remember seeing that comic in the comics that I have?
[58:18.27]Yeah, that was... Oh, thanks, Matt.
[58:21.42]That was one of my favorite issues here, set around this bad boy.
[58:23.82]What's your favorite Deadpool versus Wolverine comic book time?
[58:28.42]When he says to Kane, Hey, get out of my kitchen.
[58:36.89]Hold on a second.
[58:39.83]Hold on a second.
[58:42.31]There was a thing on my shoulder.
[58:43.77]I didn't want anyone to see.
[58:44.62]Alright, so I mash these up?
[58:46.72]Yep.
[58:47.00]Let's put it right here.
[58:52.24]Oh, the TENS units.
[58:55.30]Alright, the Deadpool show continues.
[58:57.89]Oh, Pog.
[58:58.77]Pumpkin Pie Pog.
[59:00.01]Can I see it in the chat room?
[59:02.15]Let's see Pumpkin Pie Pog in the chat room.
[59:09.20]Okay, I need a masher.
[59:12.18]Just like I mash those bad guys.
[59:14.16]God, I wish I was part of the Avengers.
[59:16.94]Imagine me in the Avengers.
[59:18.22]No way.
[59:18.96]I would take them all down.
[59:23.53]Where's the masher?
[59:29.37]I'm not used to this kind of kitchen.
[59:33.09]Oh, okay.
[59:33.61]I think I found it.
[59:38.58]That's probably a good idea.
[59:44.00]OK, colander.
[59:46.68]Ah, colander.
[59:49.04]I see it right here.
[59:50.42]I've got a colander now.
[59:58.52]So it's really important to drain your water away from these potatoes.
[60:06.13]Pumpkin.
[60:08.54]And I think that we lost a little bit, but it's okay.
[60:13.24]Get that in there like that.
[60:15.56]Drain it all.
[60:18.87]You don't, if you put too much water in here, it's going to be kind of screwed up.
[60:24.21]And now that goes back in the pot for those of you that don't know.
[60:28.65]And now we mash him up just like fucking Thanos man.
[60:36.11]Hey, do you understand that I'm the only guy in the comic that's beaten Thanos?
[60:39.42]It's me only, man.
[60:40.56]I did.
[60:40.92]I'm pretty nervous about this one now.
[60:44.46]I'm not going to lie to you, Deadpool.
[60:46.10]Why are you nervous about this?
[60:47.68]Oh, no, not your dish.
[60:48.64]These.
[60:50.24]What's on you, man?
[60:51.56]It's the TENS unit from Lex Luthor.
[60:54.80]What diabolical villain put that on you, dude?
[60:58.33]Who does Deadpool... Who's your nemesis in this universe, bud?
[61:03.53]Who the fuck is in the Deadpool comics here?
[61:07.44]Cable.
[61:07.90]That guy sucks.
[61:08.88]Who's that?
[61:09.57]Cable.
[61:10.59]Okay.
[61:15.73]I've never seen... Name me the first line of the first comic book that I say.
[61:21.97]Dear reader... Welcome to the show!
[61:24.12]Got it wrong.
[61:25.44]Shit.
[61:26.62]I don't know comics.
[61:28.12]I don't pretend to know comics.
[61:30.40]You don't like comic books?
[61:31.48]No, I love comic books.
[61:32.48]I don't know Deadpool comics.
[61:33.58]I don't like them either.
[61:34.30]I prefer television.
[61:36.27]What's your favorite TV show?
[61:37.27]Teletubbies.
[61:40.21]Why?
[61:42.97]I like the songs.
[61:44.72]That's respectable.
[61:45.48]Yeah, they're catchy, man.
[61:46.74]They're catchy.
[61:48.88]So these are all mashed up nice and good.
[61:50.54]Now you have to cook it.
[61:52.50]Now we cook this back in the oven or where are we going with this?
[61:55.16]I don't know.
[61:56.26]It says one and a half pounds, which I think we missed.
[62:00.08]This feels kind of heavy.
[62:01.66]And then two cups of mashed cooked pumpkin.
[62:05.64]Okay.
[62:06.42]Oh, never mind.
[62:07.30]We put it in a saucepan.
[62:08.90]Hold on.
[62:09.16]I'm going to be able to see a little bit better.
[62:12.98]Oh.
[62:14.60]Shh.
[62:14.78]Don't.
[62:15.28]Don't say anything.
[62:15.94]It's me.
[62:16.38]Don't say anything.
[62:21.75]I got your saucepan.
[62:23.35]Oh, thanks for the saucepan, man.
[62:24.37]Appreciate it.
[62:26.31]We should actually use a bigger one.
[62:28.33]So this now goes from here into here?
[62:29.76]No.
[62:30.08]You need to put it into a blender.
[62:32.38]You're on step four now.
[62:34.08]Step four.
[62:34.28]What's that say?
[62:37.28]Beat the pumpkin and evaporate it.
[62:39.38]Slice each jalapeño pepper in half and scoop out the seeds and membrane.
[62:44.24]I've got a different sheet.
[62:47.78]Well, if you say so.
[62:48.68]I'm getting tired, man.
[62:49.89]I'm getting tired.
[62:50.43]I feel low on power.
[62:51.67]But rich in vitamin C. Oh, my God.
[63:02.69]There it is.
[63:04.70]Bring those puppies.
[63:05.86]This is definitely mashed as good as it's going to be.
[63:08.68]Alright.
[63:09.32]Put it in this blender.
[63:10.36]Okay.
[63:11.42]And then I'll dump the evaporated milk.
[63:15.86]So this is going to make the filling, I assume, here.
[63:21.92]I see the problem.
[63:23.40]What is the problem?
[63:25.20]I left the slicing unit in there.
[63:29.84]Oh, okay.
[63:30.38]Now dump that.
[63:31.02]Okay, let's get it in there.
[63:32.00]Probably not over here because there's a lot of wires, man.
[63:35.35]What have you done?
[63:36.61]I wouldn't be worried about it.
[63:37.38]I'd say just go for it.
[63:38.14]OK, let's go for it.
[63:42.32]Man, that gun reminds me of the guts that I pulled out of the villain that I fought in that fucking battle.
[63:51.87]He was such a wuss.
[63:54.71]He was such a wuss.
[63:55.43]You got a spoon, man?
[63:57.93]Yeah, I just got help here.
[63:59.87]I don't want to use my power for this.
[64:02.16]That would be a waste of your talent.
[64:03.56]Work with your humans, you know what I mean?
[64:07.35]I am a human, but I'm an experiment too.
[64:09.63]That's rough enough.
[64:15.72]That looks pretty good, man.
[64:23.90]What's next, dude?
[64:25.02]Evaporated milk.
[64:25.88]Evaporated milk goes in there too.
[64:30.30]Don't use too much.
[64:31.04]I'm lactose intolerant.
[64:33.05]Very famously in the comics.
[64:36.18]I don't... So I didn't measure that.
[64:40.54]You didn't?
[64:41.10]What?
[64:41.38]Nope.
[64:42.70]That's fine, though.
[64:44.16]Oh, you blew it.
[64:45.56]It's going to taste really good, though.
[64:47.40]Let's go ahead and get this moving, man.
[64:50.04]Open her back up.
[64:50.70]We got some eggs now.
[64:51.64]What?
[64:53.00]What happened?
[64:53.74]What's that sound?
[64:55.74]Oh, hey.
[64:56.46]Hey, dude.
[64:59.64]I think something's in here.
[65:00.51]Was something in here before I showed up?
[65:02.01]It's the meat brain.
[65:04.73]That looks bad.
[65:06.85]That looks awful.
[65:10.77]Sorry, that looks gnarly, bro.
[65:14.20]That looks gnarly.
[65:15.14]Yeah, come take a peek.
[65:17.30]That looks like an elephant shit in the oven, man.
[65:19.98]You have any animal that got inherited?
[65:23.84]Oh man, that's gonna be real good.
[65:25.84]Hey, I'll fight someone for that.
[65:29.53]It looks bad.
[65:32.40]Oh, it was Jerma the whole time.
[65:34.62]Oh, that thing ran in!
[65:39.55]Is it still going or is it stopping now that it hit the time?
[65:43.03]I think we should cut into it.
[65:46.93]Done is like the last word I'd use for it.
[65:50.75]The fact that you cut it and like separated it, it looks like.
[65:53.49]If you use your hand, you can tell by your palm.
[65:58.00]I could put eggs in here.
[66:00.04]What am I...
[66:06.11]I'm putting my hand on that?
[66:08.43]Do you have a meat thermometer?
[66:12.69]Yeah, we can stick it in there.
[66:20.20]That's a pen.
[66:21.48]We can maybe try it with that.
[66:22.68]Stick a pen.
[66:25.06]Oh, there we go.
[66:28.40]There's a cap, I think.
[66:30.88]Let's take the cap off.
[66:35.26]Alright, here I go.
[66:41.28]What does it say?
[66:42.16]I can't read it yet.
[66:43.30]Oh, sorry.
[66:46.78]It's OK.
[66:47.40]109.
[66:47.76]That's not done.
[66:49.08]That's not done.
[66:51.50]Oh, so we're almost there.
[66:52.54]109.
[66:57.80]That's like a lawsuit.
[67:01.40]Alright, so two large beaten eggs.
[67:06.49]What do we, let me get a bowl.
[67:08.93]I'm working on my own, okay, nevermind.
[67:10.39]That's huge.
[67:13.08]I don't want to put this on the fire.
[67:16.46]You need two eggs?
[67:17.38]Yep.
[67:17.76]Oh, do you have one?
[67:18.60]I'm going to break one, you're going to break one.
[67:20.26]Okay.
[67:22.26]We're doing this in pretty diminished vision, but it's okay.
[67:24.64]It should be fine.
[67:26.12]It looks like we're making some weird potion.
[67:29.28]This looks so cool, actually.
[67:31.88]Put the egg in.
[67:33.40]We need two eggs in here.
[67:37.75]Take the other egg and put it in there.
[67:39.37]Quickly, don't show anybody.
[67:44.25]Yes, she has now two bat wings.
[67:47.75]Three lizard's tails.
[67:49.31]Alright, should we beat these?
[67:50.65]Yeah, beat the shit out of it.
[67:53.45]I need a whisk of some kind.
[67:55.37]Use the one that I was using on the raw meat.
[67:57.07]It should be good.
[67:59.37]OK.
[68:02.64]That was a dumb joke.
[68:03.46]I have to wash my hands now.
[68:05.85]I just put my fingers in my nose thinking it'd be funny.
[68:11.09]I just shut up.
[68:11.53]I don't know.
[68:12.05]I was just like, oh, it'd be funny.
[68:13.11]Alright.
[68:17.87]I'll grab the whisk.
[68:18.95]Hey, to the one guy that said bring back Deadpool and the 3,000 of you that said get rid of him, I appreciate that.
[68:26.87]This is, ah, ow.
[68:28.47]Are you alright?
[68:29.11]Nope.
[68:29.77]Oh, that looks intense.
[68:30.89]That was fucking nuts.
[68:32.95]I can't, this is a spatula.
[68:34.59]Oh my God, that was a lot worse.
[68:35.77]I know we can't see very well, but this is a spatula.
[68:38.37]Yikes.
[68:39.93]So what do you have in there now?
[68:40.67]You have the milk, you have the pumpkin.
[68:41.69]Yeah, we got the milk and the mashed pumpkins.
[68:45.05]I'll be very honest, if I don't start making the eggs, the water is going to evaporate until it's empty.
[68:49.41]Like it's going to be a...
[68:54.51]Alright, that can stay there forever.
[68:57.81]So this goes in there?
[68:59.13]Yes.
[68:59.55]Okay.
[69:00.51]Yeah, let's go to your egg salad.
[69:02.49]I mean, this is pretty much ready to go.
[69:03.69]I've got a pretty good beating job here.
[69:05.53]I can't see this.
[69:10.61]Oh, brown sugar and cinnamon.
[69:12.81]Those eggs are beaten.
[69:13.49]I'm going to put the eggs in here because it's going to take 12 minutes.
[69:15.41]Okay.
[69:15.77]So if you can take that, I will put some eggs in here.
[69:18.27]We need more ginger, believe it or not.
[69:20.45]Okay, so we're on step one of like eight.
[69:23.19]For your egg salad?
[69:24.47]Boil these eggs for 12 minutes.
[69:25.83]I need a timer for 12 minutes.
[69:27.33]I cannot see anything.
[69:28.35]I just broke an egg.
[69:30.23]I wish I could see anything.
[69:33.15]Actually, I need to... Let me see one of these things.
[69:37.04]Oh, here it is.
[69:37.54]Oh, fucking who cares.
[69:38.42]It's going in.
[69:40.90]I'm putting my hands in the boiling water.
[69:44.40]Jesus.
[69:44.84]You good?
[69:45.32]Yep.
[69:47.63]OK.
[69:48.09]Oh, you just dumped the egg with shell and everything?
[69:50.45]Oh, the shell.
[69:50.87]Yeah, you're hard boiling these eggs apparently.
[69:54.05]OK.
[69:58.59]You got a 12 minute timer going?
[70:00.21]Good.
[70:01.12]So now, what do we do with that pumpkin pie?
[70:04.61]I put the brown sugar in the eggs.
[70:06.85]Okay, that smells good.
[70:08.27]It's coming, and I can read now.
[70:09.79]And now it's, oh no, I put cinnamon, and now it's brown sugar and ginger.
[70:15.74]Okay, I actually, I would put that in a latte.
[70:18.68]Alright, I got the ginger.
[70:25.30]Oh, this is whipped cream.
[70:26.02]Cool.
[70:26.36]Alright.
[70:26.80]So now, what step are we on here?
[70:30.17]Like four, I think.
[70:32.85]How is this possible?
[70:35.11]This is the longest pumpkin pie recipe ever.
[70:39.77]Steam is coming out of my mother's ears right now.
[70:42.59]Okay.
[70:43.73]Make the filling.
[70:44.41]Beet, pumpkin, evaporated milk, brown sugar, eggs, cinnamon, ginger.
[70:48.03]Your favorite.
[70:49.01]I just put in a good pinch of ginger.
[70:51.29]Nutmeg.
[70:53.05]And salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined.
[70:57.07]So that's taking the place of that.
[70:58.37]Yes.
[70:59.21]So that's now pour into the prepared crust after that's blended up.
[71:02.68]OK.
[71:03.00]That'll be easy.
[71:04.52]We're good.
[71:06.32]So you got a timer going, you said, right?
[71:08.50]OK.
[71:08.72]For 12 minutes?
[71:10.02]It's very important that it is exactly 12 minutes.
[71:13.90]Alright.
[71:14.34]Here we go.
[71:17.84]Somebody said they thought I was dressed as a pig.
[71:20.69]Wait.
[71:25.61]Why isn't this working?
[71:27.01]It does look weird.
[71:29.41]Is it plugged in?
[71:30.59]I thought I did.
[71:33.08]It's plugged in.
[71:36.74]That thing is going to launch off the top of that, I think.
[71:39.30]It's going to be like, you are going to be an infomercial black and white screen in five seconds, I think.
[71:45.48]I've got this perfect.
[71:54.55]Careful.
[71:56.51]The lid's on backwards?
[71:58.81]You might be right.
[72:01.80]Is it this way?
[72:03.06]Yeah.
[72:07.10]OK.
[72:11.06]I definitely had it the right way.
[72:12.26]Alright, so we do think whoever's temperature is higher wins.
[72:18.94]OK, I'm down.
[72:19.86]You're using the raw meat thermometer?
[72:21.82]Yeah.
[72:21.98]Wait, what?
[72:22.30]How did you do that?
[72:25.01]Do you want me to help?
[72:26.18]Yep.
[72:26.26]What button?
[72:26.92]Any of them.
[72:27.24]I'm going to do medium.
[72:46.45]Because when you do that, you're going to make sure that it blends together completely.
[72:50.23]I agree.
[72:50.63]Can you just... We should probably do it a little bit longer.
[72:53.19]I think maybe 10%, 20% longer.
[72:55.51]I think I turned it off accidentally.
[72:56.91]We have to break down the bonds.
[72:57.91]Okay, so now we're going to...
[73:18.01]The recipe made me shit my pants five times.
[73:19.71]So I mean, we have to be careful.
[73:21.75]I think that should be good.
[73:22.45]That should be.
[73:22.99]I think we're good.
[73:25.59]So now the next step with that.
[73:27.76]We got a timer going for that?
[73:30.52]OK.
[73:32.10]Bake.
[73:33.38]Oh, we have a prepared crust?
[73:35.94]Yeah, actually.
[73:36.62]I know we do somewhere.
[73:37.94]In the fridge.
[73:44.38]Yes.
[73:48.83]Designs?
[73:49.53]Ooh, I like that.
[73:53.49]So why do we have cheese?
[73:56.18]Oh, that's for the meatballs, or the meat brain.
[73:58.66]Oh, wait a minute.
[73:59.40]The meat's still in here.
[74:00.26]You should tell them what's happening again with your arm speed, because people are just really concerned you're hurt.
[74:06.33]What?
[74:06.79]Oh, it's a TENS unit, so it fires my muscles for me.
[74:10.79]They're not wrong.
[74:12.75]It hurts.
[74:13.09]Do you want it turned down?
[74:15.83]No, I can take it.
[74:19.30]I'm going to test in the meat again to see if it's, what is it, 160?
[74:24.69]Yeah, 160.
[74:29.77]And anybody can cook if they have a room full of like 10 people telling them what to do.
[74:34.11]I'm going to pour in the pie crust unless you have any objections.
[74:37.39]No, go for it, yeah.
[74:38.05]Let's test this.
[74:38.61]This is smoking a lot.
[74:39.81]That means it's a good thing.
[74:40.73]Let's see.
[74:42.73]We are at, that can't be right.
[74:53.03]76 degrees.
[74:55.69]Hold on.
[74:56.95]Wait, wait, wait.
[75:04.69]There we go.
[75:08.22]Okay, ready?
[75:09.14]100... 95!
[75:09.20]How did it get lower?
[75:12.54]Oh, yeah, she's cooling off a bit.
[75:15.08]95 degrees in the middle?
[75:15.86]That's impossible.
[75:19.18]Okay, the middle, the top part is like 100.
[75:22.87]40.
[75:23.01]No, it's not.
[75:25.13]Do we have tongs?
[75:25.89]I don't want to, like, grab that.
[75:28.15]Hey, low and slow.
[75:29.39]Low and slow.
[75:29.85]Let's turn it down.
[75:31.53]Low and slow.
[75:32.11]Let's get it to, like, 350.
[75:33.05]Low and slow.
[75:35.86]Bake.
[75:36.10]350, right?
[75:40.74]Better make room in there, because here comes the pie.
[75:43.14]What?
[75:43.64]Wait, that's going to taste like fucking beef.
[75:48.32]There's only one oven.
[75:50.86]There's no room for that.
[75:53.66]You're not going to put it in there with this, right?
[75:55.81]Oh wait, I need to put it in a pan first.
[75:58.05]You need to put it in something that can hold it.
[76:01.91]Just put this pie in there.
[76:03.69]It's the next step.
[76:05.19]Okay, we need to... What do we got for these?
[76:08.06]Oh, you're right.
[76:11.42]This can go raw in the oven here?
[76:13.32]Okay, we got time on that one.
[76:17.68]Do you have any mitts?
[76:20.18]Nope.
[76:20.72]Dude, this is going to be awful.
[76:24.07]Let me help.
[76:27.39]We're putting on the same rack.
[76:31.69]That's going to be our meat-flavored pumpkin pie.
[76:33.84]Oh, this is awful.
[76:34.60]We need oven mitts.
[76:35.20]We need to at least move it around.
[76:36.80]How long is that supposed to be in there for?
[76:38.96]Only like 10 minutes.
[76:41.92]You know what?
[76:42.28]We might have unlocked a secret recipe because this is going to be the best of the worst pumpkin pie ever.
[76:46.28]Jesus Christ.
[76:47.10]Oh, obviously.
[76:48.56]Hand me a second towel.
[76:50.04]Yeah.
[76:50.74]Alright, let's see.
[76:57.95]98.6 degrees, perfectly normal for me.
[77:00.49]I am the one who has to eat that.
[77:03.15]Oh, no, no.
[77:03.80]I'm talking about that's my temperature.
[77:08.18]This just is not going to work.
[77:11.71]Okay, I'll be really honest.
[77:13.15]I don't think you're supposed to have a tens unit on for more than like three minutes.
[77:16.40]Like total ever.
[77:17.44]Is he right?
[77:21.82]Does anyone know?
[77:22.94]People leave it on for their entire training set for like three hours.
[77:27.00]Sorry, I'm full of shit.
[77:30.78]Don't worry.
[77:31.58]Okay, well, this is bad.
[77:33.00]That's going to be bad.
[77:34.72]We have another pie.
[77:35.38]Wait, open that bad boy back up.
[77:36.69]What?
[77:38.63]Another pie can't fit in here.
[77:40.81]No, on the bottom rack.
[77:42.37]Oh, okay.
[77:42.96]Where is our oven mitts?
[77:43.74]He just had them right here.
[77:45.64]I thought they were by the towels.
[77:47.60]I couldn't find them.
[77:48.58]I need a bowl, because if one thing in this whole show is going to be good, it's going to be this.
[77:52.64]I don't care about that.
[77:53.84]I'll just use a towel.
[77:54.80]I just don't want to burn myself.
[78:03.60]Yeah, just be careful.
[78:08.22]Alright, so when that's done...
[78:13.63]Oh, that's right.
[78:14.49]That's what this thing is for.
[78:16.31]Cool.
[78:17.33]Oh, shit.
[78:17.81]That's awesome.
[78:19.49]Who thought of that?
[78:20.95]That's a great idea.
[78:21.61]Alright.
[78:25.32]Pumpkin pies.
[78:26.72]Locked and loaded, baby.
[78:28.72]Ow, you electrocuted me with your arm.
[78:31.22]I actually still feel my muscles, like, tensing on their own now, which is probably a good sign.
[78:35.70]You just put it, like, on your, like, butt cheeks.
[78:37.63]Yeah, well, I thought that would have been fun too, but you can't see it, so then I just, like... Yeah, every so often you'd be like... Okay, so I need new ice because we took, like, an hour to do this, so... Yeah, just refresh all that.
[78:53.18]Okay, looking good.
[78:55.04]You got a little bubble buildup.
[78:56.34]Watch this life hack.
[79:00.38]If it doesn't taste good, he fucked it up.
[79:12.76]Cooking is fun.
[79:14.10]Yeah, this is going well.
[79:15.30]I think we're making great time, too.
[79:16.56]You know what?
[79:17.00]It's going to be weird because that pumpkin pie is probably going to be really good.
[79:19.80]It is.
[79:20.04]It's going to be fantastic.
[79:21.64]Everyone's going to be so pissed off when everybody here eats this and goes, man, it's actually very, very good.
[79:26.07]I think the proximity to the meat is going to really help extract that umami.
[79:30.81]I think so.
[79:31.11]Make it more savory.
[79:33.03]Yeah, it gets you here.
[79:34.51]And it gets you right here.
[79:35.67]You know what I mean?
[79:36.23]Yeah, one of those.
[79:37.17]I don't know what it means, but I agree.
[79:41.80]OK, some of these eggs are broken.
[79:42.70]That's OK.
[79:42.92]You've got two minutes left.
[79:48.20]Two minutes?
[79:48.62]OK, good.
[79:49.16]I was going to say, I almost have it down to the side.
[79:50.66]You're annoying.
[79:55.34]Hey, look, it's me, the pig.
[79:59.04]If you guys want, while you're waiting, you can start chopping jalapeños in here.
[80:08.21]Oh, we have to make jalapeño poppers.
[80:10.71]Oh, wait, what?
[80:12.91]Oh, yes, yes, yes.
[80:14.71]Where are those at?
[80:16.27]Oh, do you want to take the raw onion challenge?
[80:18.03]Are you not going to?
[80:19.95]I'll do it.
[80:21.07]Where's a knife that hasn't been used on meat?
[80:22.97]In the knife closet.
[80:25.47]Oh, good.
[80:25.67]You don't think I can hang with the onion challenge?
[80:28.05]Oh, I know you can.
[80:29.55]I wouldn't have offered if I didn't think you were man enough.
[80:31.41]Mm-hmm.
[80:34.97]Let me wash my hands.
[80:35.75]I've been touching meat.
[80:37.88]Oh, OK.
[80:43.69]So do we win anything if this is good?
[80:46.53]We usually compete against Matt and Danny because they make the same dish, but they didn't do it this time.
[80:51.45]So you're going to take a bite out of that onion?
[80:53.43]Yeah.
[81:00.37]You've got to really get primal with it.
[81:02.15]You've got to show who the boss is.
[81:07.85]You do this for fun?
[81:09.39]Not often.
[81:10.39]I've done it on every episode so far, though.
[81:14.45]Woo!
[81:16.79]It's not even hard.
[81:19.11]Hey, right there.
[81:20.97]See, everyone gives me shit for that.
[81:22.17]It really is easy and tastes good.
[81:24.17]It's good.
[81:29.08]Fuck all of you that thought I couldn't do it.
[81:32.18]He's going to projectile vomit in a minute.
[81:37.02]Well, you can finish it if you want.
[81:38.80]I did three bites.
[81:39.46]I think that's pretty good.
[81:40.08]Getting a little hot in here.
[81:46.15]It tastes so good, your eyes are starting to water.
[81:47.79]You know what it reminds me of?
[81:49.47]Your eyes are watering.
[81:50.15]No, they're not.
[81:52.19]His eyes are watering.
[81:53.25]No, it's a condition.
[81:54.59]Alright, so do you like hot, like spicy mustard?
[81:57.29]I hate it.
[81:57.99]What?
[81:58.45]Yeah, I hate it.
[81:58.93]It's the same exact sensation.
[82:00.89]Yeah, but it doesn't taste as good as an onion.
[82:02.85]Eggs are good.
[82:07.57]Quickly, quickly, don't fuck around any dice.
[82:09.49]Alright, go, go, go.
[82:13.03]Didn't you just do that?
[82:14.31]What?
[82:14.69]Yeah.
[82:28.08]I'm so excited for this.
[82:29.64]I've never even had like a full egg salad.
[82:31.38]Oh.
[82:38.16]Oops.
[82:41.82]Oh, you did have a couple of breaks in there, huh?
[82:43.86]There was a couple of breaks.
[82:44.80]Yeah, that's alright.
[82:45.52]That's why you do 12 eggs, so there's always plenty.
[82:47.24]There's always plenty.
[82:48.16]OK, this is perfect.
[82:49.24]I'm going to go right into the ice bath.
[82:50.64]Yep.
[82:55.52]Oh, yeah.
[83:02.65]Ice and more ice.
[83:04.15]12 minutes only.
[83:05.02]Don't do it any more than that.
[83:06.94]12 minutes with the ice or 12 minutes in the boiler?
[83:08.74]12 minutes on the boiler.
[83:09.46]Oh, yes.
[83:17.10]That looks good already.
[83:19.18]Yes.
[83:19.75]OK.
[83:20.03]This is off, right?
[83:21.57]No.
[83:21.95]Yes.
[83:22.59]Should be off.
[83:23.01]That should be off.
[83:23.53]It's off.
[83:24.27]I will work on this.
[83:26.29]That looks gross.
[83:28.95]We don't need it again.
[83:29.75]That's fine.
[83:30.89]It'll be alright over there.
[83:32.37]OK, so do you want any more of this onion?
[83:34.98]No.
[83:35.60]Actually, I think I'm good.
[83:38.48]We should probably, how long are those supposed to be in there for?
[83:41.56]The pies?
[83:42.20]Yeah.
[83:43.32]Those are in there for like 40 minutes, I think it said.
[83:48.78]Oh, the jalapeño.
[83:49.42]Where are the jalapeños at?
[83:50.50]I'll start on the mummies.
[83:51.18]In the bag.
[83:53.00]That didn't help me.
[83:54.74]In the fridge.
[83:55.54]Oh.
[84:00.09]We're at one tenth.
[84:04.50]110 on the meat?
[84:04.98]The meat is 110.
[84:06.32]How?
[84:06.86]It's been in there for like two days.
[84:10.44]I say if it gets to 120, we just let it rip.
[84:13.54]Yeah.
[84:13.96]Alright.
[84:14.58]And we'll just eat the ends.
[84:16.72]Alright.
[84:16.92]So I'm going to get started here on these eggs.
[84:19.04]They've been in an ice bath now for about, I'd say, 60 seconds.
[84:21.52]You really want to make sure they're nice and cool to the touch.
[84:24.82]Okay.
[84:25.44]Oh, my God.
[84:26.52]Wow.
[84:27.00]You really cranked that one up, didn't you?
[84:29.78]Wow.
[84:30.80]That hurt real bad.
[84:33.68]What the fuck?
[84:34.67]I was kind of in the middle of something.
[84:36.31]Yeah, sorry.
[84:36.71]Please, continue.
[84:38.43]So once these eggs are in the ice bath for about two minutes, you... No, don't let me interrupt you.
[84:45.06]What the fuck?
[84:50.09]I was just looking for a good knife.
[84:51.71]You're going to take them out of the ice bath.
[84:55.09]And once they come out of the ice bath, you're going to peel them.
[84:57.81]And don't fuck around here.
[84:58.67]I know I see people do this shit with these eggs.
[85:00.78]They break them.
[85:01.38]They smash them on a counter.
[85:02.72]No, no, no.
[85:03.44]Don't be an idiot.
[85:04.68]It's very simple.
[85:05.96]Get a paper towel.
[85:07.62]Bingo.
[85:07.82]You're going to take a paper towel.
[85:12.12]You're going to lay it on a clean surface, which I think this is pretty clean.
[85:15.51]I hope so, for the love of God.
[85:18.19]It's pristine.
[85:19.73]You're going to take it.
[85:20.93]You're going to go tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[85:22.93]Tap, tap.
[85:23.27]Let's move some of this shit out of the way.
[85:26.64]OK.
[85:32.32]Let's just do it up here.
[85:33.79]You're going to tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[85:37.35]Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[85:38.85]Once it's done like that, you're going to roll it.
[85:41.48]Roll it back and forth like this a few times, right?
[85:44.46]You're just trying to get the crunches.
[85:45.90]Don't go hard.
[85:46.54]Okay.
[85:47.24]Now this thing's ready to...
[85:52.50]peel.
[85:53.52]So once it's ready to peel, and I'm going to do the rest of these over here, you need to go into the sink here because you don't want to do this right here because it's kind of gross.
[85:59.80]But the eggshell will come off very easily under cold water.
[86:02.60]Fucking idiot.
[86:09.80]Do you want to help me do this?
[86:10.66]Yeah.
[86:10.96]Let me see if I got the technique right.
[86:14.86]So you take it and roll it, right?
[86:17.22]So take it, tap, tap, tap a little bit on the paper towel.
[86:20.06]You want to get a little bit, it should look, because you don't want to just start ripping it off.
[86:24.58]People just rip this shit off and they mess up the whole thing.
[86:27.44]And there you go.
[86:28.02]Look at that.
[86:28.36]That's a perfect gosh darn egg right there.
[86:30.78]That looks like a perfect egg.
[86:31.88]Beautiful.
[86:33.22]And they should be completely done in the middle.
[86:34.78]No jelly, no soft.
[86:36.70]It's a hard, hard boiled egg.
[86:38.00]So then I've got it cracked.
[86:39.74]So you got it cracked.
[86:40.23]You rolled it a few times.
[86:40.99]Yeah.
[86:41.19]You're going to bring it over to the sink and you're going to slowly, with the water running, take it off.
[86:45.91]It's so much easier.
[86:48.54]So now we need a bowl, like a bowl to mash stuff up in, which one of these would probably be fine.
[86:54.72]There's still meat cooking in this oven.
[87:03.56]This is probably fine, right?
[87:06.09]How do you get the clothes off, like effectively?
[87:08.25]The clothes?
[87:09.99]Oh, I can't see shit.
[87:10.83]No, no, not during my egg salad recipe, please.
[87:12.93]I think not during my egg salad.
[87:20.73]I actually just nailed it in the dark.
[87:21.97]You nailed it.
[87:22.39]Let's go.
[87:23.35]You nailed it.
[87:24.73]That goes in here.
[87:25.53]That is a perfect egg.
[87:26.63]Oh, you can't see that at all.
[87:27.79]I know.
[87:28.21]Nobody can see.
[87:28.99]I think I'm in the right spot, though.
[87:30.09]So we're going to just keep doing it.
[87:31.51]This is an egg for you.
[87:33.19]Thank you.
[87:35.05]Are we sharing the space?
[87:35.93]I mean, we can.
[87:36.45]It's fine.
[87:38.13]Get it nice and cracked.
[87:38.91]Roll it a few times.
[87:40.89]There you go.
[87:41.55]See, he's got it.
[87:42.35]I feel confident.
[87:43.20]He's got it.
[87:44.88]It's easier if you're right next to the sink and you have like a little bowl.
[87:49.00]I hope I'm at the right sink.
[87:50.08]Yeah.
[87:51.95]Didn't even need the water.
[87:53.91]Oh, you got it off without the water.
[87:54.85]Came right off.
[87:55.73]Usually the water kind of helps peel the egg.
[87:59.55]It kind of catches inside of the cracks and will pull it off.
[88:02.07]Do we use the egg shell for everything?
[88:04.13]No.
[88:04.19]No, you just throw it away.
[88:08.61]Put that in there.
[88:12.07]We could probably do a few more of these.
[88:13.35]That should be good.
[88:13.99]Okay.
[88:14.29]We don't need to do all.
[88:14.95]We don't need to do the whole thing.
[88:18.99]You're a natural.
[88:19.71]Look at you.
[88:20.05]I know.
[88:20.31]I'm in a well-oiled machine right now.
[88:21.75]I'm in flow state.
[88:23.39]So I'm going to need your help on the next part because it is incredibly important.
[88:26.11]And is there Tabasco in that fridge?
[88:30.27]Thank God.
[88:30.67]That was a test.
[88:33.47]You don't put Tabasco in the fridge.
[88:38.83]Another perfectly done egg.
[88:40.60]Very good.
[88:43.74]And I am not fucking around.
[88:44.92]I want everybody to eat this.
[88:47.39]Oh, you won't stop me from eating it.
[88:49.49]I'll eat all of it.
[88:50.77]So when you're done with that, that should be okay for them.
[88:52.65]But we have another couple if we want to make more.
[88:57.06]Are you here?
[88:57.50]Yeah, you're right there.
[88:59.44]It is dark and you are doing very well.
[89:01.46]I am crushing it.
[89:02.22]Holy shit, dude.
[89:03.18]That was unbelievable.
[89:05.42]Okay.
[89:06.54]We've got our fully cooked eggs.
[89:08.36]12 minutes and in the ice bath and here.
[89:11.79]It's now time to make the egg salad the perfect way.
[89:14.49]The only way you should be eating this.
[89:17.64]I'm going to go into the fridge here.
[89:18.72]And I'm going to take out the strawberry jam.
[89:26.98]Oh, Jesus.
[89:27.52]I'm just kidding.
[89:29.55]I actually thought that was part of your recipe.
[89:31.19]I was getting excited.
[89:32.01]Alright, so we have mayo.
[89:33.19]Is there another one right here?
[89:34.17]OK.
[89:36.26]So the whole point with this is people make egg salad and they make it like a runny, watery piece of shit.
[89:41.06]That's not what you want to do.
[89:42.58]This should be, you're folding in this mayo, small amounts at a time, not a ton of it, right?
[89:48.66]Because you don't want it to be runny and gross.
[89:51.07]So we got the, you're right?
[89:55.45]Yep.
[89:56.43]Okay.
[89:56.93]So what is this?
[89:58.53]Cream cheese strawberry?
[90:00.13]Why is this in here?
[90:01.51]Just in case we need it.
[90:03.15]Okay, so I need, this is my brown mustard.
[90:05.99]There we go, okay.
[90:07.25]This has horseradish in it.
[90:09.17]We're just doing ground brown mustard, mayo, Tabasco.
[90:13.87]You can't beat the American classics.
[90:16.03]You really can't, these are the best.
[90:18.27]Where's the Tabasco?
[90:21.29]Over there, I think.
[90:28.81]Where is it?
[90:32.30]Oh, it's in there, okay.
[90:33.16]Oh my god, this is huge!
[90:37.27]What you do is you put the entire bottle of Tabasco.
[90:41.93]Oh my god, this is like the, this is the crazy one.
[90:44.98]Holy shit.
[90:45.82]Yeah.
[90:46.64]Do you want to see it?
[90:48.06]Is it just normal Tabasco?
[90:49.24]It's just Tabasco, yeah.
[90:50.14]Regular Tabasco, don't get the other stuff.
[90:51.62]The other stuff is fine, but not for this.
[90:54.22]Can you test that meat to make sure?
[90:56.08]Oh, check the meat?
[90:56.92]Because, I mean, it's going to be like a hockey puck in like 10 more minutes.
[91:00.48]Where's the thermometer?
[91:05.05]I can eyeball it.
[91:07.13]Oh, it's in the sink.
[91:07.69]It's right there.
[91:08.93]Oh, yeah, that's a cool... That kind of does look like a brain, though, so I think we're alright.
[91:12.79]Alright, so here we go.
[91:13.65]The meat juices are starting to overflow.
[91:15.93]I need some utensils.
[91:17.26]A fork is fine, or a masher is fine.
[91:23.44]Why are they torturing you so much?
[91:25.04]No, that was just me.
[91:28.92]I don't want a metal.
[91:29.66]We shouldn't use that again for the meat, should we?
[91:32.14]I mean, if you clean it, it would be fine.
[91:33.26]OK.
[91:33.32]Do we have like a spatula?
[91:34.92]Yes.
[91:35.00]All the back pieces are in that part where I'm going to go.
[91:44.81]OK.
[91:44.89]So in here?
[91:45.43]No.
[91:45.51]This is a dishwasher.
[91:48.53]That's a dishwasher.
[91:49.51]Oops.
[91:54.46]You say under the stove?
[91:57.88]That's an oven.
[92:03.09]I'm so sorry.
[92:05.29]A spider!
[92:05.97]Get off me!
[92:09.71]Get off me!
[92:10.29]Where is it?
[92:23.50]Oh, I've got some good news, campers.
[92:26.34]Good news?
[92:26.76]181.
[92:26.98]Yes!
[92:27.22]Oh, yeah, actually, I put it at the very end.
[92:32.89]There's no spatula, but I can use one of these spoons.
[92:34.81]It's fine.
[92:35.71]Actually, this would be fine.
[92:39.45]No, it's fine.
[92:40.91]Bad news, campers.
[92:43.57]Not quite there yet.
[92:44.86]It's fine.
[92:45.48]I'll use this.
[92:45.98]It's fine.
[92:48.28]No, it's fine.
[92:49.26]It's fine.
[92:50.62]You're getting up.
[92:51.04]Don't sit down.
[92:51.44]It's fine.
[92:55.07]That'll be ready at some point, I'm sure.
[92:58.17]This is not the tool I would want to be using.
[92:59.93]Okay, so you want to mash these eggs up.
[93:01.71]This is the egg salad.
[93:02.75]Okay.
[93:03.25]This is perfect, by the way.
[93:04.33]You see the eggs are fully cooked in the middle.
[93:06.98]There's no jelly, no jam.
[93:08.38]They're not soft-boiled.
[93:09.72]Don't soft-boil these eggs.
[93:10.68]They have to be hard.
[93:12.56]I'm just going to use this because it's easier.
[93:14.22]I'm going to try not to scratch your plate.
[93:16.60]Okay.
[93:17.52]So while I do this, I would like for you to take the mayo, open it up.
[93:20.86]Mm-hmm.
[93:23.59]And I want you to get a nice big helping of it and slop it in here.
[93:29.08]You know what?
[93:30.64]I kind of want to clean that thing.
[93:33.58]The mayo?
[93:34.58]Let's clean the mayo.
[93:38.16]The masher would be perfect.
[93:39.55]And it's in that thing that you put your feet in before you get in the pool.
[93:45.23]Do we have a different masher, you think?
[93:46.57]The masher is the only masher we have.
[93:49.79]Maybe use your hands.
[93:54.17]Okay.
[93:55.57]Maybe.
[93:56.67]Let's go around this.
[93:58.21]Here, I got some mayo.
[94:00.21]Okay, so this has got to be a little bit, it's not quite ready for it yet.
[94:03.80]Okay.
[94:04.58]Once I, you really just want to break down the eggs.
[94:06.90]Don't make it mush though.
[94:08.62]You want it to be chunks.
[94:12.53]It's green.
[94:13.97]OK, so a chunky egg salad is what you're looking for.
[94:16.62]You don't want a gross paste that people usually do.
[94:19.26]So once you get it to about every egg has been broken in half and maybe in thirds and pressed down with a fork a little bit,
[94:26.18]That's where you're looking for the mayo.
[94:27.56]So we're looking for a good helping of this.
[94:30.25]So right now?
[94:31.15]Yeah, just a little bit.
[94:31.97]Like you want to put in, that's way too much.
[94:35.25]That was aggressive.
[94:38.77]It's like a snake coming out of that.
[94:41.70]That was gross.
[94:42.58]That was like Play-Doh.
[94:43.56]Go with the old Halloween jump scare.
[94:45.68]Ooh, the mayo.
[94:46.96]Here we go.
[94:48.12]Like that.
[94:48.80]That's good.
[94:49.10]Yeah, we'll start with that.
[94:53.17]Okay.
[94:53.85]I don't want to use this metal utensil in here because I don't want to scratch your nice pans.
[94:58.91]So now that that's good, we use this now.
[95:00.33]Okay.
[95:00.97]Actually, no, we won't.
[95:01.55]That's dirty.
[95:02.05]I want something else.
[95:06.53]Alright.
[95:06.81]This would be good.
[95:07.25]Alright.
[95:07.51]So here we go.
[95:09.72]So I'm going to need you to give me a little bit more mayo.
[95:14.86]I'm here.
[95:15.54]Yeah, that's good.
[95:16.42]And that's two tablespoons of mayo.
[95:22.06]And when you put two tablespoons in, don't put any more in, because remember, this is for 12 eggs, and there's not 12 eggs in here.
[95:27.78]How many eggs do we have?
[95:28.58]Why don't I feel like I'm on a morning show?
[95:31.30]I'm like the weird guest in the weird morning show where they get the guy on for five minutes, and he needs to make a whole food recipe.
[95:37.20]This is looking good, though.
[95:38.20]No, no, no.
[95:39.10]It really does.
[95:39.66]It actually is fantastic.
[95:40.70]I'll be honest with you.
[95:42.65]I don't know why people say it's bad.
[95:44.63]I mean, somebody in my community made it, and they were like, dude, this made me sick.
[95:48.69]And I was like, come on, dude.
[95:49.43]That's a lie.
[95:53.70]So you don't want it to be this chunky.
[95:55.24]That's why I'm trying to press all the chunks out.
[95:56.81]Yeah, it's a good technique too.
[95:58.39]Yeah.
[95:59.83]And now that it gets kind of like this, you want it to be... Okay, look.
[96:02.71]Look at that.
[96:03.05]Doesn't that look good?
[96:04.59]Best egg salad I've ever seen.
[96:07.33]Once it gets like this, that's when you start to add the other ingredients.
[96:10.48]So now I need one tablespoon of that ground mustard.
[96:17.34]Here she comes.
[96:18.44]Yep.
[96:20.59]Don't put too much of the mustard in first.
[96:22.43]You want to make sure you do it in very slowly, because that can be overpowering.
[96:27.09]One tablespoon of ground mustard.
[96:28.71]You don't want the flavors to go to war.
[96:30.69]No, you really don't.
[96:32.41]This is just to help bring out some of the, to get rid of some of the egg flavor and bring in some of the mustard flavor.
[96:37.39]So that goes in.
[96:38.41]You fold that in.
[96:39.70]And at this point now, you're folding, right?
[96:41.72]You're folding this in.
[96:42.68]You don't want to be mixing like crazy.
[96:44.52]You want it to stay kind of chunky.
[96:46.91]And once that's in there nice and good, you will, not quite yet.
[96:52.27]We need salt and pepper, but we don't have any salt.
[96:55.08]So double on, oh wait, we do have some salt.
[96:57.86]Do we?
[96:58.24]Is the glass broken?
[97:00.12]Looks like we had extra salt.
[97:02.20]Okay, so there is salt.
[97:03.46]So we need about, I want to say, I'll tell you when.
[97:07.73]Go for it.
[97:08.05]This usually goes well?
[97:09.01]Yep.
[97:13.54]Very good.
[97:15.00]Fold that in.
[97:15.60]Pepper, too, if you have it.
[97:16.52]If you have pepper.
[97:17.87]Okay.
[97:19.21]You can just like get it in there.
[97:21.23]That's not how this one works.
[97:22.31]Oh, God.
[97:22.95]Wow.
[97:24.82]Wow.
[97:24.94]No one's messing up my recipe.
[97:26.78]Okay.
[97:27.24]There.
[97:31.52]People are just tuning in.
[97:32.94]You just got possessed.
[97:35.36]It's like a devil inside of me.
[97:36.74]Yeah, I just got real excited for the pepper.
[97:42.87]A little too much probably went in, but that's okay.
[97:45.83]You can never have too much pepper, as they say.
[97:47.99]So now I need to be the judge of this.
[97:50.01]I need to determine if it's ready.
[97:51.55]Yep.
[97:54.02]And again, consistency matters here.
[97:56.84]Do you see what this looks like?
[97:59.09]I'm going to tell you right now, we're going to do the Dairy Queen test, okay?
[98:03.03]Oh, yep.
[98:03.61]What's that?
[98:04.19]It's ready.
[98:05.77]It should not fall out of the spatula.
[98:08.26]Do you understand?
[98:08.86]We're doing the Dairy Queen Blizzard test.
[98:11.38]That's real science.
[98:13.32]If it falls, you have done it wrong.
[98:16.50]Start over.
[98:18.50]Okay.
[98:19.96]I'm excited.
[98:20.83]Yeah, this is good stuff.
[98:22.11]Is that the final form?
[98:24.03]It's not.
[98:25.11]We need onion powder, and I need to put this in too.
[98:28.65]This is Tabasco, this is regular Tabasco.
[98:31.72]Shake it up, don't, because the vinegar will fall down here.
[98:34.32]So is this supposed to be kind of like an egg salad with a kick?
[98:38.04]It's just, it tastes good.
[98:39.70]Regular egg salad tastes kind of like eggs, and eggs kind of taste like shit sometimes, but this makes it taste better.
[98:43.79]How much?
[98:44.43]Just a little.
[98:45.89]Don't electrocute his arm.
[98:48.67]A little bit more.
[98:49.74]A little bit more than that.
[98:50.88]OK, that was a lot.
[98:52.78]It'll still be fine.
[98:54.16]I think it's going to be OK.
[98:55.80]He got electrocuted.
[98:56.56]That's what happened.
[98:58.26]I don't know how that happened.
[98:59.10]I had such a steady pour there.
[99:00.30]It was so steady.
[99:01.80]Until the very end.
[99:02.62]Until the very end.
[99:05.99]Actually, it's going to be OK, because we have a lot of eggs in here.
[99:07.81]Are we going to need to double up on eggs?
[99:10.83]No, no, no.
[99:11.79]It'll be fine.
[99:13.53]Once that's in like that, this is almost ready.
[99:15.41]We have that one tablespoon of mustard.
[99:16.71]We're going to have to test it first.
[99:18.67]But that's not before we put in the secret ingredient.
[99:21.80]Is that the secret ingredient?
[99:22.72]Tabasco is the secret ingredient.
[99:25.68]And what we do here is we like to do a shot of this.
[99:27.36]No, I'm kidding.
[99:28.76]I'm saying like what we do here.
[99:30.90]This is your show.
[99:32.23]This is your recipe.
[99:33.23]Oh, you're saying what we do here.
[99:35.61]Here we go.
[99:35.93]Ready?
[99:36.41]Ready?
[99:42.09]You want to do it for about 10 boops.
[99:44.92]Just one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[99:46.78]Stop at seven and look.
[99:49.12]Is this a seven kind of boop?
[99:51.60]This is just a taste because some people like it a lot more.
[99:57.70]So do you eat eggs with hot sauce?
[100:00.93]Never.
[100:01.65]OK.
[100:01.91]Does anybody in here do eggs in hot sauce?
[100:03.81]You do.
[100:03.97]OK.
[100:04.15]You've got a few people.
[100:06.07]This kind of does that.
[100:07.73]It's that classic hot sauce and eggs flavor with a little bit of ground mustard.
[100:12.82]And the onion powder brings out the egg flavor.
[100:15.70]This is ready to eat.
[100:18.51]I want people to eat this and I want to hear what you really think about it.
[100:21.59]You could do more mustard if you wanted to, but let's get a good look at this with the camera because it looks fucking phenomenal.
[100:26.61]He's not lying.
[100:27.63]That looks like great egg mush.
[100:30.29]Go ahead and get a look.
[100:35.51]Bring it over to Aaron.
[100:37.81]Aaron's got an appetite too.
[100:51.18]Well, these are long recipes, to be fair.
[100:53.12]Okay.
[100:55.96]Who wants to try the famous egg salad?
[100:57.92]Well, hold on.
[100:58.42]You've got to present it first.
[100:59.72]You've got to plate it.
[101:00.44]Yeah, we've got to plate it.
[101:04.65]It is like a movie theater ground over here.
[101:07.41]So many plates.
[101:10.63]I didn't know how many people wanted it, so I just grabbed like four plates.
[101:14.49]Do we need more?
[101:15.07]No, that's good.
[101:16.15]I think this should be alright.
[101:17.69]Oh, yeah.
[101:18.01]Actually, we do have smaller plates.
[101:19.09]Let me taste it first to make sure that this is correct.
[101:26.12]I don't know where to put this.
[101:34.14]Is the onion sitting in there nicely?
[101:37.03]Ain't anybody in planet Earth going to have a better egg salad than that on the fucking table right now.
[101:42.69]God, I'm excited.
[101:43.39]I am dead serious.
[101:45.19]Ain't anybody on Earth is going to have an egg salad like that.
[101:49.95]That smells good.
[101:50.31]That smells good, doesn't it?
[101:50.90]That smells good.
[101:52.04]Alright.
[101:52.24]That's got a lot of personality to it.
[101:53.54]Let's go ahead and plate it up.
[101:56.97]Now usually this would go on an onion roll, an onion roll with a slice of cheddar.
[102:03.98]Do it.
[102:04.92]What's an onion roll?
[102:07.60]Like an onion roll.
[102:10.72]It's like sandwich bread.
[102:12.12]But it's like a roll and it's like an onion roll.
[102:16.93]Gotcha.
[102:18.83]Who would like to try?
[102:19.81]Me.
[102:22.03]I'm a growing boy and I need my egg salad.
[102:24.10]Should we get some for you guys too?
[102:25.82]Yep.
[102:26.30]I wonder how many of you guys are just sitting there going, I don't want to eat this, but I'm going to.
[102:29.34]I mean, it's right here.
[102:32.71]Matt's usually our taste tester.
[102:34.33]Okay.
[102:35.43]And I want this for real and I want it out of 10.
[102:37.35]Yep.
[102:39.16]I'm ready.
[102:49.56]That's a 10.
[102:49.86]That's really good.
[102:51.98]That is really good.
[102:52.68]I'll give it a 10.
[102:54.26]I don't know who made themselves sick off the recipe.
[102:56.12]That shit slaps.
[102:57.54]That's really good.
[102:59.00]I like that.
[103:00.19]That's a 10, right?
[103:01.11]That's a 10.
[103:07.98]That is really good.
[103:08.86]Wow.
[103:09.06]It is, isn't it?
[103:09.62]We've never had something that tastes that good.
[103:11.50]This is actually probably the best thing we've ever had on the show.
[103:14.22]Like, not even close.
[103:15.52]Yeah, half of the shit we make is inedible.
[103:16.98]This is like a real meal.
[103:18.14]The last thing I told you, last episode, I had to drink a Carolina Reaper milkshake.
[103:23.85]Milkshake, yeah.
[103:25.03]Well, that's not the Elbertson family recipe, is it?
[103:29.03]Mmm.
[103:30.04]No one does it like the Albertsons, am I right?
[103:33.98]That is so fucking good.
[103:35.88]Goodness me.
[103:36.66]The egg, does it taste like eggs?
[103:39.34]No, it doesn't.
[103:39.90]It does not.
[103:40.74]It just tastes good.
[103:42.48]It tastes like you're eating clouds, like really tasty clouds.
[103:49.24]That'll be $70.
[103:49.56]It's good?
[103:54.12]Okay.
[103:55.22]That is very good.
[103:56.70]Wow.
[103:57.20]Do I have a pass from everybody here?
[103:59.44]Everybody?
[104:00.82]Yeah, Caelid hasn't tried it yet.
[104:04.30]Oh, my God.
[104:04.74]Oh, it's bad?
[104:05.20]No, no, no.
[104:08.10]Just got a little tense for a moment.
[104:10.36]Didn't want to drop the plate.
[104:11.33]Is there more?
[104:13.19]There's a lot here, yeah.
[104:14.63]Do you want more?
[104:15.13]I mean, there's more eggs.
[104:17.43]I could make more.
[104:18.17]I mean, I could do it.
[104:19.71]It's good.
[104:20.87]Taking the whole pan.
[104:21.75]Maybe do it.
[104:23.99]Hey, what's the number one thing a chef likes to see?
[104:27.38]A smile.
[104:29.16]A clean plate.
[104:31.30]You both had it wrong.
[104:32.96]I said eggs, you said smile.
[104:34.68]Eggs.
[104:36.84]There you go.
[104:39.05]There it is.
[104:40.09]That is so good.
[104:42.67]Oh, yeah.
[104:50.48]Also, it's almost beer goggle time.
[104:52.80]Oh yeah, we can get the beer goggles out.
[104:54.91]We can get the beer goggles on and I've loaded the blowers up with sprinkles.
[104:59.07]Sprinkles?
[104:59.59]That's cute.
[105:00.39]Oh, that's cool.
[105:01.21]Okay, so this is on.
[105:02.07]We should probably turn this off.
[105:03.61]Man, this is good.
[105:04.17]Shit, I can't see.
[105:07.03]That kind of smells good.
[105:12.93]The pie is coming along nicely, too.
[105:14.49]Honestly, everything here today might be good, except maybe the meat, but who knows?
[105:19.06]The meat does not seem like it's going to be very good.
[105:22.62]We can save it, though.
[105:23.76]Well, you put ginger in it.
[105:24.94]You sprinkled ginger in there.
[105:26.58]That's to bring out its character.
[105:30.32]Well, we got the light from the oven.
[105:31.36]That's good.
[105:33.65]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[105:37.57]We'll be back in a minute.
[105:40.18]Oh, baby, I don't want to get shocked off camera.
[105:42.32]That'd scare the shit out of me.
[105:50.13]Oh, are we going?
[105:50.81]There's no way to tell.
[105:51.61]I can't.
[105:51.95]I can't tell.
[105:53.93]Oh yeah, I can't see your fingers.
[105:55.57]Hey!
[105:56.71]It's the beer goggles segment that's become kind of a staple, so now we do the spooky spaghetti in beer goggles.
[106:05.28]You can try and read that.
[106:06.50]There's no way I'm gonna be able to read this.
[106:07.92]Like I said to you just now, it's like powering a mech of your own body.
[106:11.32]It is so disorienting.
[106:13.05]But I'm getting good now, watch this.
[106:14.45]Okay.
[106:15.91]Preheat oven.
[106:17.91]Spooky spaghetti and eyeballs.
[106:19.71]Preheat the oven to 375.
[106:23.11]in a large bowl, mix together the ground beef.
[106:25.59]Wait, we already did this.
[106:27.71]Oh, no, no, no.
[106:28.83]Yeah, we did the meat.
[106:29.71]We didn't do the spaghetti part.
[106:31.19]OK, while the meatballs are baking, cook your spaghetti noodles in salted water.
[106:36.54]OK, so we're going to do it al dente.
[106:39.12]Yeah, al dente.
[106:40.22]Let's check the meat.
[106:43.12]It's in the microwave.
[106:44.02]That's right.
[106:44.32]It's in the microwave.
[106:44.92]Oh, because we decided we were going to finish it off in the microwave.
[106:49.48]Because it wasn't done completely all the way through.
[106:52.58]So we just put it in for like a minute or two.
[106:54.44]This is probably hot.
[106:55.80]I probably shouldn't touch that with my bare hands.
[106:59.93]I'll give you the towel.
[107:06.13]We need a thing to take this out with.
[107:07.73]Yeah, here.
[107:11.62]I'll get the noodles.
[107:14.44]Yeah, actually, when you're in these for long enough, you kind of get kind of used to what it feels like.
[107:18.78]This is the wrong one.
[107:20.80]It's more of like the depth.
[107:22.32]Are there noodles in this fridge?
[107:23.74]There would not be noodles in this fridge.
[107:29.96]Oh, okay.
[107:30.16]Actually, that makes a lot of sense.
[107:31.58]I feel like I'm going to drop this on the ground.
[107:33.86]No, you got it.
[107:35.08]It's going to be like that thing from The Office when that guy drops his chili on the ground.
[107:40.98]Okay, I think I got it.
[107:44.72]I'll be your eyes like it's a claw machine.
[107:56.32]Oh, you're good.
[107:57.44]Oh, you're good.
[107:59.58]Is mic cut off?
[108:00.56]It's just scratching a little bit.
[108:04.93]I'm just going to move it.
[108:10.79]Oh, I don't want to touch inside.
[108:16.13]Up here?
[108:16.45]I can't read.
[108:22.96]I'm going to go by color.
[108:23.80]Do we have Barilla?
[108:24.62]Because I think this is the color of Barilla.
[108:28.04]That's the brand.
[108:33.64]I got them.
[108:35.32]Alright.
[108:39.62]How many noodles?
[108:41.97]I would say at least one.
[108:43.75]Oh, I've got a whole package here.
[108:45.15]You've got a whole package?
[108:46.15]OK.
[108:46.55]The bucatini.
[108:47.67]We need at least one of those.
[108:48.69]Is there water in this bowl?
[108:50.75]This is where the eggs are in this?
[108:52.82]Yeah, we can probably just reuse that water.
[108:54.36]Ugh.
[108:55.44]OK.
[108:56.68]Let me just rinse it real quick.
[108:58.02]Dude, this is impossible.
[109:06.83]Oh, that's your egg salad recipe.
[109:08.27]I don't think I want it.
[109:09.15]Yeah, we don't want eggs with shells and pasta.
[109:18.85]We need a large bowl.
[109:24.30]Did I just pour that on the ground?
[109:26.52]I hope I didn't.
[109:27.98]I didn't hear it hit the floor.
[109:29.00]Oh, I need water in it.
[109:29.74]You're going to have to read that.
[109:34.38]I'm struggling on this.
[109:35.33]It's like wet too.
[109:39.27]So I would say get a good handful for our disgusting bloody brain pasta.
[109:46.41]It's going to taste so good though.
[109:49.40]Can you help me decide how much water is in this?
[109:51.64]Because I actually can't see.
[109:53.90]How much is it?
[109:54.36]Is it enough?
[109:56.37]Keep going.
[109:57.15]More?
[110:01.07]More?
[110:01.29]I feel like we're getting pretty full.
[110:05.77]Yep, we're good.
[110:06.75]More?
[110:07.01]No, no, you're good.
[110:11.30]Oh yeah, I switched the tins unit placement so it no longer goes in, it'll go out now.
[110:16.31]Okay.
[110:16.65]Which is better.
[110:17.77]Which burner?
[110:19.37]Oh, that makes this way worse.
[110:21.31]Do the top left.
[110:22.66]Oh my goodness.
[110:24.60]I feel like I'm playing a fucking Virtual Boy right now.
[110:27.14]Oh god, yikes.
[110:29.64]I had to really work to hold that one.
[110:33.37]Here.
[110:36.47]I know.
[110:39.59]With the pasta, the water needs to be boiling.
[110:43.71]Oh my goodness.
[110:46.20]What was that sound?
[110:47.84]What's that sound?
[110:48.52]The can of sprinkles.
[110:50.50]What's that sound?
[110:55.22]Ow, that hurt.
[110:56.80]Ow, my teeth.
[111:01.55]OK.
[111:01.65]The water needs to be boiling first.
[111:02.99]It's going to take like 30 minutes to boil this water.
[111:07.44]No, spaghetti doesn't need full boiling.
[111:12.40]Get this shit out of here.
[111:14.64]OK, so this one is OK.
[111:19.51]Is it on?
[111:22.53]I'll do the touch test.
[111:23.27]Is there trash?
[111:24.29]Oh, it's on.
[111:28.23]I can feel the heat.
[111:29.25]Yeah, the heat's coming out.
[111:30.15]Is it on the right spot?
[111:32.93]Yeah.
[111:33.55]OK, this is going to be fucked.
[111:35.66]It's going to go well.
[111:37.43]Okay, you like al dente, right?
[111:40.09]Yes.
[111:40.39]It's eight minutes, nine minutes, maybe 12.
[111:43.01]I don't remember.
[111:44.91]Alright, I'll keep track up here.
[111:50.73]And you guys are eating bucatini.
[111:54.59]It's bucatini pasta.
[111:55.29]Yeah.
[111:55.41]I feel like I have a strong prescription.
[111:57.25]You know what I mean, right?
[112:00.39]You know when you put somebody's glasses on and they're not your prescription?
[112:03.98]And it's like, holy shit, dude, your eyes.
[112:08.96]Alright.
[112:09.62]Is it on?
[112:10.28]Yes.
[112:12.86]Don't be afraid.
[112:13.46]Fuck!
[112:20.89]I don't think I've put it in the right spot.
[112:23.75]Is it in the right spot?
[112:28.75]I'm looking for a light.
[112:31.75]I'm not moving because I don't think I'm in the right spot.
[112:34.31]I'm going to find a light for us.
[112:38.65]I'm coming.
[112:39.43]You have a light?
[112:40.00]There's no way I'm going to find a light.
[112:41.50]I'll come with you.
[112:45.54]Oh, there we go.
[112:46.22]Oh, that looks weird.
[112:47.72]Alright.
[112:48.36]We're going down the mine shaft.
[112:50.84]Dude, I... I feel like I'm in It Follows right now.
[112:55.32]I feel like I can... I'll open my eyes in a pool.
[112:57.58]There you go.
[113:00.02]You want to put that somewhere?
[113:01.98]This does not help.
[113:02.62]Alright.
[113:04.96]I'll be your eyes.
[113:07.60]You know, I'm just gonna put it around my neck.
[113:10.66]Alright, so.
[113:15.84]Dude, you put like 25 servings.
[113:18.40]They started shocking my arms and it felt like I was gonna drop all of it.
[113:21.80]There's 40 servings of pasta in here.
[113:23.90]Well, we got a lot of hungry folks out here.
[113:26.42]Okay.
[113:29.74]Do cavemen.
[113:31.22]Wait for fire, man.
[113:32.90]Fire.
[113:33.88]Wait for pasta to be boiled, al dente.
[113:38.63]You, like al dente.
[113:40.41]Me, like soft pasta.
[113:42.59]And then I club you in the fucking head.
[113:45.51]You instantly die.
[113:49.91]Is it on?
[113:51.31]Yeah, it's definitely on.
[113:52.21]No, it's not.
[113:53.07]It's not?
[113:53.55]It's not on.
[114:03.26]This is not on.
[114:04.16]No, it's definitely not.
[114:04.94]We're going to go to one that's on.
[114:06.00]Okay, use the top, right?
[114:07.50]The top.
[114:08.48]That looks like a dead animal.
[114:11.22]It looks like a corpse.
[114:14.64]That looks, in these goggles, like, yeah, there is a dead animal.
[114:18.55]Well, it is kind of technically true.
[114:20.03]But, like, it's rotting.
[114:21.27]Like, this looks like what happens when you open a sarcophagus.
[114:25.05]King Tut's tomb.
[114:28.27]Um...
[114:30.09]I think the one under here is on.
[114:33.66]I'm going to lift this up and you do a heat sense.
[114:38.94]Am I close?
[114:40.00]Is there heat?
[114:41.72]No.
[114:43.02]Are any of these on?
[114:45.30]Let me tweak on some knobs here.
[114:48.14]This smells awful.
[114:50.76]It should be top right or it could be bottom right.
[114:52.90]I'm not really sure where I am.
[114:55.74]Top right.
[114:56.14]Okay, Charlie.
[114:57.78]Yep.
[114:59.71]Oh, ew.
[115:01.29]Alright, I can see it.
[115:02.97]That one's on.
[115:03.31]Yeah, that one's on.
[115:06.33]I just want to go put this in the trash.
[115:09.03]OK, so you can shed it over here if you want, like all the way over here.
[115:12.01]That's too far.
[115:19.77]Now that's got to move to there.
[115:22.71]Let me know if I'm on it.
[115:24.01]OK, am I on it?
[115:26.11]What is in there?
[115:27.76]What have you done?
[115:32.79]I think you're a little bit further up.
[115:35.67]To the right.
[115:37.15]And I think you're good.
[115:37.71]Alright, now we just have to wait for that pasta to cook.
[115:41.97]It should be quick.
[115:42.83]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[115:43.49]I feel like I'm getting too close.
[115:50.76]Where is mine?
[115:52.64]Oh, right, okay.
[115:55.96]Where's the off-shoot?
[115:56.94]Where's the off-shoot?
[116:02.56]There we go, I got it.
[116:03.20]You get yours?
[116:05.78]No.
[116:08.52]Where is the button?
[116:09.66]It's like underneath it, like the starboard side.
[116:16.15]What's that?
[116:16.51]That was me, that was me.
[116:17.79]You're good.
[116:19.97]You know what, I'm just going to take it off.
[116:21.19]A lot of melting sprinkles.
[116:23.20]That's what we need, though.
[116:24.26]That's what the recipe calls for.
[116:25.72]Oh, there's sprinkles in it.
[116:27.96]Oh, there's some sprinkles on the meat.
[116:30.22]That'll be good though.
[116:31.48]What do we do with the meat?
[116:32.50]What was next on the list?
[116:45.08]I'm going to hear from a lawyer.
[116:47.12]OK.
[116:47.32]While the meatballs are baking, cook your spaghetti noodles in salted water.
[116:52.19]We have to wait until the pasta is done.
[116:53.49]Oh, wait.
[116:53.75]Salted water.
[116:54.71]Combining the pasta with the eyeballs.
[116:56.61]We made a brain, so it's way cooler.
[116:59.61]Once the pasta and meatballs are done, create a nest of pasta on your plate and top with the parmesan.
[117:07.16]Does it say how much salt?
[117:08.58]Does it say how much salt?
[117:11.23]It just says salt.
[117:12.01]Don't put too much in, though.
[117:13.87]Is any coming out?
[117:14.53]I can't tell.
[117:16.19]Oh, there we go.
[117:16.87]I can't see.
[117:17.34]You think that's enough?
[117:20.08]I would put a little bit.
[117:21.56]Excuse me.
[117:21.84]The back burner is still on.
[117:23.40]Back burner?
[117:23.96]This one's on?
[117:24.72]The one that you guys moved the other pasta from.
[117:26.54]So this one's on.
[117:27.38]Oh, that is definitely on.
[117:29.30]Yeah, don't touch that.
[117:30.52]I'll turn it off.
[117:32.28]Nothing's on it, right?
[117:33.72]There's probably enough salt, right?
[117:35.90]Yeah, definitely.
[117:37.08]Your mic fell again through your costume somehow.
[117:39.56]Me?
[117:39.76]Yeah.
[117:42.92]Don't worry, I got it.
[117:43.68]It's in the costume.
[117:54.94]It's in.
[118:00.02]What happened?
[118:01.70]It's in your pocket.
[118:02.80]Oh.
[118:15.11]Alright, here we go.
[118:22.81]Oh, what the fuck was that?
[118:23.90]It's just it turning back on.
[118:25.30]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[118:28.76]Something is burning very badly.
[118:30.94]No, that's cooking it, Matt.
[118:32.52]It's called cooking.
[118:33.81]OK.
[118:35.93]You can put it back.
[118:37.29]OK.
[118:38.59]How's that?
[118:42.30]Alright, so we got pasta here.
[118:44.16]Yep, that's looking good, too.
[118:46.10]That smells weird.
[118:46.88]Why does it smell so weird?
[118:49.30]It's sprinkles, yeah.
[118:53.27]I also really like the approach of only having pastas in there so far.
[118:58.05]Well, you took the whole entire bucket.
[119:02.25]That's what the recipe called for.
[119:04.25]Don't listen to Matt.
[119:04.94]He doesn't know how to cook.
[119:06.00]I think he thought I was here.
[119:10.16]I'm trying not to get my wire in the heat.
[119:11.76]Can I get some help to put this back on?
[119:13.28]Yep, I got you.
[119:13.98]Alright, you're going to need to zip me up.
[119:18.22]And I think I can do this.
[119:22.84]The guy with the beer goggles on is the one doing this.
[119:25.21]That's so funny.
[119:26.07]There's a zipper here?
[119:27.89]Yes, go.
[119:28.95]It should be a zipper.
[119:29.87]Was it a zipper?
[119:30.41]I think it's a zip.
[119:32.39]Oh, no, no, no.
[119:32.69]It's Velcro.
[119:33.25]It's Velcro.
[119:34.03]Oh, sweet.
[119:36.82]There you go.
[119:37.54]Thank you.
[119:39.06]There we go.
[119:40.04]I'm going to get this back in here.
[119:45.13]And now this needs to be... Yeah, up here.
[119:48.85]Oh, the pies are fucked.
[119:50.23]No, I've been keeping track.
[119:51.83]The pies are fucked, are they?
[119:54.15]No.
[119:59.11]Right, I already calculated about eight more minutes should be fine.
[120:01.53]I'm going to do a mic test and I want to make sure people get... Is this alright?
[120:04.66]Are we good?
[120:05.80]Are we okay?
[120:07.63]Okay, so the pie is ready.
[120:10.23]So I can't see it really well.
[120:12.53]I don't even know what I just touched.
[120:14.87]I can see them.
[120:15.43]Okay, let me get a... You're allowed to move them.
[120:23.37]Is this plastic?
[120:24.37]Why is this... I smell something.
[120:27.15]No, it's a sprinkle.
[120:28.31]It's just our sprinkles.
[120:30.09]Okay, so we need oven mitts.
[120:32.41]Yep.
[120:33.25]Here they come.
[120:38.18]This is a dishwasher, so never mind.

[121:56.65]Hold on, hold on.
[121:57.53]I'm going to float over to it.
[121:58.97]Ooh, this is so delicious.
[122:01.87]Ooh.
[122:03.07]That's done.
[122:03.79]Yeah, I think so too.
[122:08.41]I don't know.
[122:09.09]It just hurt.
[122:10.96]Hold on a second.
[122:17.36]Yuck.
[122:27.30]I wouldn't eat that one.
[122:28.68]Let's maybe just try the other one.
[122:30.54]I'm going to keep that one in there for a minute.
[122:32.01]This is our meat pie, so this one might be a little tangy.
[122:35.69]This is a horror movie.
[122:38.21]How does it... Can you sense?
[122:39.77]Yeah, let me... Oh, shit!
[122:40.87]Pasta!
[122:42.58]Oh, it's... It's almost done.
[122:46.16]No, it's not.
[122:47.22]It's half done.
[122:47.70]No, it's not.
[122:49.44]Why is the other half just sitting there chilling?
[122:51.74]What do you mean, other half?
[122:52.66]Other half of what?
[122:53.14]It's got its feet in the water, like it's on the beach.
[122:55.16]Alright.
[122:58.98]Other half of what?
[122:59.69]I poured the whole box in.
[123:00.99]It didn't go all the way in.
[123:03.11]Oh, wait.
[123:03.53]I dropped one on the floor, I think.
[123:06.81]Hey, now I hear you tell if spaghetti's done.
[123:12.43]I can't tell if it's stuck.
[123:15.73]No, we don't need a second box.
[123:18.05]He said we only did half.
[123:20.27]What?
[123:20.93]I don't know.
[123:21.49]Dude, this is pasta for like a hundred people.
[123:24.37]Just a hundred people could eat this if we put this second box in.
[123:30.21]Okay, this is a problem.
[123:33.21]Because this is going to be half-cooked pasta.
[123:36.51]We need... I'll get you a fork.
[123:38.91]You need like a spoon or something to push it in.
[123:41.97]Oh, wait, this should... Wait, where's the...
[123:45.28]I have, like, the sponge units.
[123:47.46]I think I have the right utensil.
[123:48.90]Oh, here, these.
[123:50.74]It's one of these.
[123:51.36]What did you... I don't even know what you're holding.
[123:54.83]I think these are butter knives, I think.
[123:56.71]Oh, no, that's better.
[123:57.29]Much better.
[123:57.61]Yeah, this is good.
[123:58.77]Hey.
[124:03.25]I'm trying to escape.
[124:04.15]Are they all in?
[124:13.83]Hey.
[124:17.03]This is so frightening.
[124:19.35]Remember that guy, Wolverine?
[124:28.91]Why is this in the sink?
[124:30.91]What is it?
[124:31.67]It's in fucking Tabasco.
[124:33.55]We got to clean it later.
[124:34.91]I feel like my hair looks like fucking the guy from, what's his name, Bill Murray's character from that bowling movie.
[124:41.63]What's his name?
[124:42.73]I don't know what movie you're talking about.
[124:43.76]The bowling movie, what's his name, Ernie?
[124:46.37]I feel like my hair is fucked.
[124:48.27]Alright.
[124:49.49]So that pie looks scrumptious.
[124:51.49]Yeah.
[124:52.41]Oh, yeah.
[124:52.69]We can dig into that pie.
[124:53.90]I sense that it's ready.
[124:58.02]Give it the plop test.
[124:58.96]Drop it.
[124:59.40]And if it jiggles, we'll know it's ready.
[125:03.10]I couldn't see it.
[125:03.74]Did it jiggle?
[125:05.14]Did it jiggle?
[125:05.82]I can't tell.
[125:06.28]Alright.
[125:07.32]Let's eat.
[125:07.88]Oh, I got it in my hair.
[125:08.73]Alright.
[125:09.27]So this is cooking.
[125:10.13]That's good.
[125:10.65]That's working.
[125:12.85]Also, the TENS unit is now more in a pulsating sensation instead of like a muscular contraction sensation.
[125:18.87]Right, so that should probably feel good.
[125:20.75]No, it feels worse.
[125:23.12]Okay, so we have our pies.
[125:24.62]We've got our pasta cooking.
[125:26.48]We had our egg salad, which, you know how that turned out.
[125:30.16]That egg salad was going so hard.
[125:31.84]We've got the meat right here, Charlie.
[125:33.64]This is looking okay.
[125:34.94]Let's go ahead and poke it.
[125:36.78]Hold on, I got the plates for the pie.
[125:39.02]Plate for the pie.
[125:40.53]So we cut into the pie.
[125:41.63]What a wonderful holiday pie this turned out to be.
[125:44.31]I think so too.
[125:44.94]Whipped cream?
[125:48.96]I've been waiting all week to do this one.
[125:58.83]Alright, get in there.
[126:06.57]I don't think I made it.
[126:08.25]I'm assuming it missed.
[126:09.17]I can't tell.
[126:09.73]It's not going to work.
[126:16.26]It's impossible.
[126:17.08]No, I know.
[126:18.02]I think it's physically not possible.
[126:19.12]I actually can't tell if you're hitting it or not.
[126:20.64]But I'm guessing by the reaction, it's not.
[126:24.08]What the fuck?
[126:29.45]Oh, hey!
[126:30.43]OK, go ahead.
[126:31.91]Go.
[126:32.27]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[126:40.99]Oh, yum!
[126:42.47]Oh, did I get it?
[126:44.99]It was a lot, it was a lot.
[126:48.99]What are we doing?
[126:49.49]Oh, this.
[126:53.27]Oh, we have to slice it.
[126:57.40]Okay.
[127:03.28]What is this?
[127:04.80]We probably need a, do we maybe have a pie thingy?
[127:07.76]Yeah, I have a pie knife.
[127:09.24]Like a pie scooper?
[127:11.36]Okay, that's actually a knife.
[127:13.94]I should not be near you when you have that.
[127:16.17]No, we're good.
[127:17.09]I get it.
[127:17.97]I just look down and I see a knife up here.
[127:24.21]Yeah, that's real gelatinous.
[127:26.54]Is it a little soupy?
[127:28.24]A little bit.
[127:29.66]No, good luck.
[127:30.56]Okay.
[127:31.72]These aren't going to be the most even cuts.
[127:39.60]Oh, thank you.
[127:40.13]I'm just going to hold it and point it.
[127:42.41]Is this helping?
[127:43.93]I hope it helps.
[127:44.71]The tins is going off, but it's firing on both hands, and it's pulsing.
[127:49.29]Can we set that back to contraction?
[127:53.08]I think I got it.
[127:56.08]Ooh.
[127:57.26]From what I can see, it looks like you got a pretty decent grab of it.
[128:00.80]Alright.
[128:05.54]By the way, that pasta is not al dente anymore.
[128:08.56]That's been in there for like 22 minutes.
[128:10.02]Half of it's al dente.
[128:14.63]OK.
[128:15.85]How many people want a piece?
[128:22.81]what did I not make it on the plate that's like please sir can I have some more it's so dark and the goggles are obscuring my vision I can't tell what's happening I'm trying to give you some key lighting here yeah this is good alright
[128:46.92]Okay, so I think you probably got a decent piece from what it looks like.
[128:51.94]I think, yeah, I think they look good.
[128:54.46]There's two pieces here?
[128:56.99]I don't, I can't tell actually.
[128:58.27]I can't either.
[128:59.01]Okay, so let's check on the pasta now.
[129:02.97]Which, bro, bro!
[129:04.93]Is it coming along?
[129:06.03]Bro, you put this on there.
[129:07.23]This is gonna, that's dangerous.
[129:09.68]Actually, I need that.
[129:10.32]Where'd it go?
[129:10.86]Okay, thank you.
[129:17.95]Oh, yeah.
[129:18.70]This is not done.
[129:19.92]How is this not done?
[129:21.70]Well, to be fair, only like 25% was actually in there for a length of time.
[129:26.62]No, that's actually true.
[129:28.52]Okay, so that's going to need another probably two or three minutes.
[129:34.05]Well, we can start eating our pie right now.
[129:36.33]OK.
[129:36.88]That sounds good.
[129:38.28]So they seem very far away.
[129:40.40]Is that just the way these goggles are?
[129:41.76]Or are they actually across the whole room?
[129:43.36]This one, I think, is actually far.
[129:45.24]That one's far away.
[129:46.38]Yeah.
[129:46.74]I think it really is.
[129:49.68]Why is it so far away?
[129:50.90]I don't know.
[129:51.20]I got it, though.
[129:54.47]Alright.
[129:58.45]Oh, yeah.
[129:58.75]Here.
[129:58.87]Do you want the top?
[130:00.39]Where am I?
[130:01.95]You want the top down?
[130:02.69]There you go.
[130:05.61]Am I helping?
[130:10.32]I think so.
[130:17.30]I just burped wicked loud into the mic.
[130:20.56]How's it look?
[130:24.10]Look at the what?
[130:25.75]You say look at the guts?
[130:28.09]The cuts?
[130:29.45]Hey, okay.
[130:31.12]Alright.
[130:31.98]Here we go.
[130:33.02]Get in here, guys.
[130:35.12]Come on over.
[130:37.37]I don't know what happened.
[130:42.27]A lot of people are making a large exclamation.
[130:45.79]Did I drop that in the tank of water?
[130:48.72]I think it went in the water.
[130:49.66]What was it?
[130:50.30]How much of those?
[130:51.00]I'll cover it.
[130:52.18]I'm sorry.
[130:52.64]No, no, Matt.
[130:53.34]This is our pie.
[130:54.54]Jerma, why don't you plate one for Matt?
[130:56.20]Okay.
[131:07.86]Oh, a serving for a growing boy.
[131:10.37]You know, it's more of like a candied yam than it is pie.
[131:14.23]Do you guys crust in this?
[131:18.33]There was at one point, I think.
[131:24.12]Oh, that's good.
[131:28.22]Bon appetit.
[131:30.56]I don't know where you are.
[131:33.47]Alright.
[131:34.13]So you're going to give it a try?
[131:36.91]Yep.
[131:37.05]I'd like a different fork, please.
[131:38.92]I don't know why I thought that'd stick in it.
[131:45.26]Alright.
[131:46.08]Same time?
[131:46.72]Same time.
[131:47.34]I'll grab from over here.
[131:51.54]Alright.
[131:51.96]Where is everyone?
[131:53.21]Cheers.
[131:53.69]Cheers.
[131:55.11]Are you eating, Matt?
[131:55.83]Yeah, my bad.
[131:56.71]Cheers.
[132:03.24]That is not good.
[132:04.88]How is it no sugar in this?
[132:08.92]It just tastes like anything.
[132:10.64]Just like baby food.
[132:14.55]It's baby food.
[132:15.89]It doesn't have a flavor.
[132:17.15]It doesn't taste like anything.
[132:19.73]It's like if you melted cardboard down.
[132:21.53]Yeah.
[132:22.07]Were you supposed to put sugar in?
[132:25.55]Yeah, I hear cinnamon back there.
[132:26.87]There's no cinnamon.
[132:28.03]No, I actually did.
[132:28.99]I put cinnamon in there and pizza seasoning.
[132:31.87]Mm-hmm.
[132:34.21]Yep.
[132:34.89]I wanted to give it a kick.
[132:36.05]No, I can tell.
[132:36.89]I can tell it's in there.
[132:39.73]Is something wrong with the light over there?
[132:43.55]You guys want to try it?
[132:44.45]The light was flickering.
[132:46.13]The light was flickering, Chris.
[132:47.15]Oh, I can't see.
[132:47.49]Don't forget, there is a second pie in the oven.
[132:49.07]Oh, yeah.
[132:49.29]That's a good one.
[132:50.45]That's our good pie.
[132:52.93]Although, I guess you guys might have turned the oven off.
[132:56.95]The residual heat should make it better.
[132:58.35]I wouldn't know how to turn it off.
[133:00.99]Is there a trash anywhere over here?
[133:03.86]Okay.
[133:05.18]I promise I didn't... You're in physical pain right now.
[133:13.58]Alright.
[133:14.36]I think I see it.
[133:18.44]Oops.
[133:19.26]Wait, why is this stuff on top of the trash?
[133:21.30]Oh, that's someone's water bottle.
[133:23.34]Oh, shit.
[133:24.24]I'm sorry.
[133:24.70]I can't see it.
[133:25.08]Alright.
[133:26.65]Oh, we didn't put the whipped cream on it.
[133:27.97]Well, that's what we're going to do with the good pie.
[133:30.29]Oh.
[133:30.43]I put the whipped cream back in the fridge.
[133:33.67]Wait, wait, our pasta!
[133:36.29]Dude, this is, alright, our pasta's, it's definitely ready.
[133:39.90]Where's the, do we not have any oven mitts?
[133:41.68]Because we're out of towels now.
[133:42.62]We need the colander.
[133:43.48]What do we?
[133:45.22]Oh, actually, I know where that is.
[133:46.20]Just scoop it out.
[133:46.76]Who cares?
[133:50.02]Here.
[133:50.72]Let's get this away from you before I fucking vomit.
[133:52.42]There's a colander in here somewhere over here.
[133:55.40]Okay.
[133:55.72]That whole thing's a colander, I think.
[133:57.01]Hey, check this out.
[133:58.67]Oops, wrong way.
[134:01.48]Hey, check this out.
[134:02.48]Pop.
[134:03.06]Boop.
[134:03.40]Oh, hey!
[134:05.54]Is it actually auto?
[134:06.48]OK.
[134:06.72]I can't tell.
[134:08.34]So we need to drain and strain this pasta.
[134:11.65]I need to grab and slab that pie.
[134:16.73]Otherwise, it's going to burn.
[134:18.83]Someone's going.
[134:19.69]Oh, it is off?
[134:21.59]Someone's going to get hurt.
[134:23.13]Alright, I'm just going to use this.
[134:25.51]Be careful.
[134:26.74]Is there something?
[134:27.48]We need to turn this off.
[134:28.12]How do we turn this off?
[134:29.56]That's off.
[134:31.14]Are these all off?
[134:32.14]Off.
[134:33.58]Off.
[134:34.26]Off.
[134:34.60]Why is this still on?
[134:36.08]What did I just do?
[134:38.44]There's a light still.
[134:40.43]It's hot surface.
[134:42.25]Oh, OK.
[134:42.59]So we need to see if we do the LOL routine.
[134:49.23]I'm going to throw it against the fridge and people will laugh.
[134:51.87]Do it.
[134:54.35]I was about to throw the meat at the fridge.
[134:59.50]It didn't stick.
[135:01.36]I don't want to reach my hand in there.
[135:03.44]Boy, don't be afraid.
[135:04.89]Where's our whipped cream?
[135:08.11]I'm going to dress up the pie while Jerma tests our spaghetti.
[135:14.89]Ow, my fingers.
[135:22.56]OK.
[135:24.92]Let me make sure this is done.
[135:29.14]Oh, I lost this.
[135:30.46]I got the spoons in there.
[135:31.60]I broke the nozzle.
[135:33.18]What?
[135:33.84]Yeah.
[135:35.64]That's good.
[135:36.40]Alright.
[135:36.72]Let's test and see if it's done.
[135:39.09]Watch out.
[135:39.47]I don't know where you are, but be careful.
[135:41.53]I'm moving.
[135:44.49]Is it sticking?
[135:45.05]Did it stick?
[135:45.65]It stuck.
[135:49.35]I can tell that one didn't.
[135:51.63]Try throwing it at the wall where there's a little more grip.
[135:53.89]At the wall?
[135:54.77]Yeah, it'll grip better.
[135:58.83]It's not- put it back in, it's not ready clearly.
[136:00.87]It's not done!
[136:01.59]Oh my goodness.
[136:05.11]Why did I just- no, it's done.
[136:06.37]It is.
[136:15.36]Why do I smell burning plastic?
[136:19.96]I smell- is something on here?
[136:22.78]No, I'm just dressing up our pie.
[136:24.16]It smells like burning plastic, why?
[136:27.45]No, no, no, what are you doing?
[136:29.37]No, I'll take you down.
[136:31.32]Let me do that.
[136:31.78]Take over from here.
[136:32.52]Okay.
[136:33.00]No, you couldn't even do decoration.
[136:34.76]Oh, Charlie.
[136:36.04]That was my base layer.
[136:37.88]Charlie.
[136:38.32]What am I doing with this?
[136:39.26]It's got to be like this.
[136:43.82]I didn't hear what you said.
[136:44.74]But I'm going to take it as a sign of disrespect.
[136:51.66]That is how you decorate the top of a pie.
[136:54.23]Oh, that looks good.
[136:58.47]Do we still have those sprinkles?
[136:59.71]That'd actually go really well with that right now.
[137:01.67]Is there blood on this?
[137:04.00]This?
[137:05.16]Sprinkles?
[137:05.54]You got it.
[137:06.40]There could be bacteria.
[137:24.52]Here, pour the spaghetti over my colander in the sink.
[137:28.26]I'm just going to tell you right now, dude, that's probably the worst possible thing we could do.
[137:31.83]Because I'm going to dump it on your arm, and it's going to burn your arm.
[137:35.27]I can handle it.
[137:36.49]Okay.
[137:37.23]I trust you.
[137:38.67]Oh, no, I don't know about that.
[137:40.20]Just put the colander in the sink.
[137:42.34]Yeah, put the colander down on the sink, and I'll dump it in.
[137:45.84]Just do it.
[137:49.42]You're going to drop it.
[137:53.01]Okay, just set it down right there.
[137:54.95]I don't want to eat this anymore.
[137:56.11]Yeah, this is gross in the sink.
[137:58.13]That's why I was holding it.
[137:59.07]That's so yucky in the sink.
[138:06.08]It's just yucky.
[138:07.24]It is.
[138:08.18]Okay, can you...
[138:12.38]That's why I was holding it, but the fun police showed up, worried about my safety or something.
[138:18.26]What if you got burnt?
[138:19.86]Well, at least the spaghetti would have survived.
[138:22.30]Now it's covered in filth.
[138:24.72]I think there is actually puke in here.
[138:26.66]Yeah, I really wouldn't eat that.
[138:28.50]I puked in here before anybody could see it on the break.
[138:32.94]I took one look at that meat, and I literally threw up in the sink.
[138:35.62]And I didn't want to say anything.
[138:36.68]I was just going to blame it on somebody else.
[138:39.24]Oh, speaking of the meat, what else do we need?
[138:41.16]We have to plate the spaghetti.
[138:42.60]Yes.
[138:43.36]And then... Do you want to use the sauce?
[138:46.86]Yes.
[138:46.94]Oh, right.
[138:52.18]Right behind you.
[138:52.52]Okay, hold on.
[138:53.22]I can't... Hold on.
[138:53.84]My eyes are, like, blurry.
[138:58.94]Okay, so let's put the spaghetti... This is a small bowl, man.
[139:05.16]I was trying to move it for the second bowl.
[139:08.76]Someone's going to get a good serving.
[139:12.34]That's okay.
[139:17.34]We're going to go ahead.
[139:20.31]Do we have sauce?
[139:21.85]Oh, actually, I see it.
[139:22.77]Yeah, I see it.
[139:23.53]This is food grade.
[139:29.73]This is the good stuff.
[139:30.75]These are all off, right?
[139:32.64]Yeah, except for that one, I think.
[139:34.48]I feel like the sweetest chef right now, don't you?
[139:36.94]Yep.
[139:37.12]Like, I feel like I'm, like... Where am I putting this?
[139:49.64]That's all I can see.
[139:50.80]All we can see is, like, our arms coming out of weird directions.
[139:54.12]Did I get it in?
[139:55.58]It looks like it.
[139:56.24]Holy shit.
[139:57.14]I think so.
[139:58.34]Slosh it a bit.
[140:00.14]Oh, yeah, that's good.
[140:03.06]Give it a pan flip.
[140:03.88]There we go.
[140:10.02]Yeah.
[140:12.70]It's on me.
[140:15.28]I think that's good enough to eat.
[140:18.31]So what do we need?
[140:18.87]Oh, we need sauce for the meat too, don't we?
[140:23.28]Dude, this thing is disgusting.
[140:24.76]I don't think it matters.
[140:26.18]Well, we can dress it up and save it here.
[140:27.84]Oh, it's supposed to be a brain.
[140:28.69]That's right.
[140:29.51]We need like a plate to put it on.
[140:30.89]Yeah.
[140:35.27]I put my finger in this.
[140:36.27]I'm sorry.
[140:39.19]I don't think it's supposed to be like this.
[140:42.10]The new pie is not good?
[140:43.58]No, the new pie is water.
[140:45.48]Really?
[140:45.86]It's literally watery.
[140:46.82]I think that's just the whipped cream on top.
[140:49.80]Is it?
[140:52.02]Okay, so we need to put the pasta in here, on there.
[140:58.79]I know there's a thing in here, I saw it earlier.
[141:03.27]And then we need to cut up the brain.
[141:04.81]Yes.
[141:05.49]Here's the pasta.
[141:14.72]I don't know where I am.
[141:20.32]No, he's got it.
[141:22.04]He's got it.
[141:27.88]I don't have it.
[141:33.29]Is this right?
[141:34.25]Nope.
[141:36.75]Oh, there it is.
[141:39.03]That's not it?
[141:39.47]I gotta go to the dentist real quick.
[141:44.36]That tooth is bothering me.
[141:48.66]There it is.
[141:49.18]Alright.
[141:50.48]Scoop it on.
[141:56.76]OK.
[142:02.17]That looks OK.
[142:02.99]That's pretty good.
[142:04.01]And then that brain sits on top of that.
[142:05.93]And then we dress the brain, and it's like, ooh, gross.
[142:10.55]And then they taste it like, mm, yum.
[142:12.35]So we got, OK, so the plate's right here.
[142:13.73]So you should put the brain on top of this.
[142:15.91]Sit it on top.
[142:17.44]Yep.
[142:17.86]What?
[142:18.90]There's an animal in the fridge.
[142:20.00]OK.
[142:21.44]Oh, wait.
[142:21.74]You need me to get the brain?
[142:22.64]Actually, we need more pasta.
[142:23.92]The pasta to brain ratio is pretty bad.
[142:27.26]What should I cut the brain with?
[142:29.72]Oh, actually, I need to put some sauce on it.
[142:34.82]And these are worms.
[142:36.38]Ugh!
[142:40.34]No one left.
[142:42.38]Not one person.
[142:43.28]It was crickets.
[142:44.16]That was actually, you can probably hear a pin drop.
[142:46.36]They were laughing.
[142:47.43]I heard snickering when you said the worms thing.
[142:49.55]You put sauce on it.
[142:53.89]Wait, you put sauce on the brain?
[142:55.53]Yes.
[142:57.89]Okay.
[142:58.85]How do we pick this up?
[143:03.33]Whoa, this knife is covered in rust.
[143:09.01]Okay.
[143:12.62]You ever see a cartoon where they're, again, this is like the lunch, the gross lunch in a cartoon.
[143:19.93]It's like, oh man, I can't believe we're having mystery meat today.
[143:22.79]Where do I even present, where do I put this?
[143:26.68]Yeah, it's Halloween after all.
[143:29.88]What do you address Meetup with?
[143:31.08]Like, what post?
[143:31.96]So what we have here is we have a disgusting, creepy, spooky brain with worms.
[143:40.73]And there's a brain that's a human brain.
[143:42.97]Yuck!
[143:44.61]Ew!
[143:47.93]Wow, that's fucking bad.
[143:49.65]How does it look like?
[143:50.79]I took it for 4K.
[143:52.13]That's bad.
[143:55.66]It's a fly.
[143:58.58]That is awful.
[143:59.40]I feel five feet taller, by the way.
[144:01.28]Yeah.
[144:01.66]Taking these off.
[144:03.68]Holy shit, dude.
[144:06.40]Well, at least we know you won't catch a foodborne illness.
[144:09.50]We have to cut into it.
[144:11.12]Oh, true, true, true, true.
[144:12.08]Alright, let me get a good knife for us.
[144:17.12]Do we have any knives that aren't covered in rust?
[144:19.55]The flies really sell that.
[144:22.97]Dude, that looks... That looks good.
[144:24.83]I don't know why you guys said that looks bad.
[144:27.81]Oh, I must have imagined that.
[144:33.87]I'm trying, Matt.
[144:34.86]I need to find something that's not rusty.
[144:37.48]And I think I did.
[144:39.72]Bon appetit.
[144:40.80]I can feel chat's little taste buds watering.
[144:44.20]Alright, put your bets on if it's completely... If it's purple in the middle.
[144:50.20]Is it going to be purple in the middle?
[144:55.31]That's cooked all the way through.
[145:03.43]Okay, let's go ahead and give it a try.
[145:05.50]I'm going to give it a try.
[145:08.50]That looks good.
[145:20.76]It needs a little salt, but it's pretty good.
[145:23.75]Well, I mean, come on, guys.
[145:25.26]Let's eat.
[145:26.42]We made it for a reason.
[145:27.82]I mean, we made it for you.
[145:29.44]We don't want to eat it because that would be rude.
[145:31.00]I mean, I'm full on egg salad.
[145:32.62]Yeah, it'd be rude to eat that.
[145:34.70]We made it specifically for all the people.
[145:35.92]Oh, I see why they're not charging it.
[145:37.02]We forgot to present the new pie.
[145:42.15]Where is the new pie?
[145:42.89]Oh, it's right here.
[145:45.77]Here.
[145:46.51]A holiday dinner.
[145:53.24]Mmm.
[145:58.85]And why is that, Matt?
[146:00.17]It's raw.
[146:01.57]The meat's raw?
[146:02.59]It looks pretty cooked.
[146:04.09]Yeah, it does not look raw.
[146:05.39]I'd go the opposite direction.
[146:08.39]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[146:09.03]Hold on.
[146:12.25]Bam!
[146:13.77]Yeah, you almost ate it without the sprinkles.
[146:16.04]We got to go like this.
[146:16.88]Bam!
[146:19.48]Well, give us a couple more.
[146:21.38]Splash a few more on there.
[146:26.58]Woo!
[146:27.70]Now she's ready to eat.
[146:34.41]That looks like somebody already chewed it up.
[146:36.59]That made me really sad.
[146:37.87]How is this one so gelatinous?
[146:41.27]This one is worse than our other one.
[146:42.79]It's the whipped cream.
[146:44.97]Yeah, you heated up the whipped cream.
[146:46.69]The whipped cream heated and melted into sugary milk.
[146:51.64]Well, I bet this tastes better, though.
[146:53.40]Here, I'll give it a whirl.
[146:54.18]I'll give it a try.
[146:54.84]Why not?
[146:55.58]I mean, we made it, right?
[146:56.60]Yeah, get in here.
[146:58.62]I'll try.
[146:59.24]I'll get a nice big heaping spoonful.
[147:01.79]Okay.
[147:08.13]This is...
[147:15.39]It's better than the other one.
[147:16.15]It is better than the other one.
[147:18.53]I wouldn't eat this willingly though.
[147:20.83]No, this is what they serve at like prison.
[147:23.03]Like when they have like special Wednesday meals where it's like the hint of pumpkin mush.
[147:31.91]Honestly, and this is going to gross a lot of people out, I feel like somebody spit that into my mouth.
[147:36.07]Yeah, it really did.
[147:37.38]Well, come on.
[147:38.28]Come taste it, Matt.
[147:39.00]Can I get a different spoon?
[147:41.24]Well, why would you want to?
[147:42.42]Never eat it.
[147:45.13]I'm actually pretty happy with how that one came out.
[147:47.07]Oh, boy.
[147:51.73]I hope you brought your appetite.
[147:53.07]I'm going to get a little crust in there.
[147:54.92]That's the best part.
[147:56.44]It tastes old.
[148:02.08]His eyes are going to roll in the back of his skull in pure flavor heaven.
[148:05.56]That is so much better than the other one.
[148:08.82]Yep, isn't it?
[148:09.34]Is it because you like it better?
[148:12.23]Yeah, because the whipped cream puts sugar in it.
[148:15.07]Well, the whipped cream is the only flavor.
[148:16.75]It's hard.
[148:18.77]So far apart.
[148:20.57]I can stomach this.
[148:22.74]Well, he's eaten two bites.
[148:25.56]OK, you ate more than one bite.
[148:27.36]Oh, yeah, try the sink pasta.
[148:37.35]Was it sitting in a bowl of water in the sink?
[148:40.73]Yes.
[148:41.81]We have to be truthful.
[148:44.57]Oh, boy.
[148:45.51]And try the meatloaf, too.
[148:46.69]It is scrumptious.
[148:47.91]It's killer.
[148:53.49]I'm sure it tastes fine.
[148:54.39]You wouldn't even know there was dirty, soapy dishwasher in it.
[148:58.03]Dishwater in it.
[149:01.79]Is the pasta cooked?
[149:02.97]Yeah, it's cooked.
[149:04.57]That's a win.
[149:04.95]The pasta's fine.
[149:05.34]That's pretty good.
[149:06.16]Can you guys swap back to the meatloaf?
[149:07.46]Oh, yeah.
[149:07.78]Can you try the meat?
[149:10.46]No.
[149:11.64]Why, Matt?
[149:12.32]Have some fun.
[149:13.11]If you get diarrhea later, it wasn't my egg salad.
[149:14.81]I'm just saying.
[149:15.25]Try it.
[149:18.43]Eat it.
[149:20.08]We all did.
[149:20.72]You ate it then.
[149:23.80]No, you didn't.
[149:24.74]No, he didn't.
[149:25.40]No, no.
[149:26.16]I watched both of you drop it on the floor.
[149:28.39]I didn't eat it.
[149:28.97]Yeah, I know.
[149:29.75]That was a really good one.
[149:31.59]It's just dry food.
[149:35.32]Unseasoned meat.
[149:36.98]Oh, we forgot the seasoning.
[149:38.60]He's right.
[149:39.50]We actually did put a lot of seasoning in it.
[149:41.78]I think the volume of meat to seasoning was not very good.
[149:46.21]Try it again.
[149:46.65]It was just a little plain before.
[149:50.75]I don't want to try it again.
[149:52.75]I'm just going to say the egg salad is the best thing we've had on this show.
[149:56.93]That's fair, I think.
[149:57.75]First pie.
[150:01.51]Ass, just terrible.
[150:02.71]I disagree.
[150:03.31]The second pie was fine.
[150:07.47]The meat and pasta is in the bottom 20% of what I've had on the show.
[150:13.59]It's not the worst.
[150:14.23]It's not the worst.
[150:15.01]Really?
[150:15.43]Yeah, it's probably the ghost pepper milkshake.
[150:18.66]Carolina Reaper milkshake.
[150:19.96]Carolina Reaper milkshake.
[150:22.12]That sounds awful.
[150:24.49]Yeah, I mean, that wasn't great, this.
[150:27.07]Let me just help clean up a little bit.
[150:28.33]Put your egg salad.
[150:29.07]It was great.
[150:30.64]Let's clean this up a little bit here.
[150:32.02]Yeah, the egg salad really pulled it together.
[150:33.46]I think so.
[150:34.98]That's a complete meal here.
[150:35.80]You've got the pie, the egg salad, the meat, and the pasta.
[150:38.01]Yeah, egg salad's an appetizer, right?
[150:40.62]kind of but I mean the the the funny part is you know when you go to like a family gathering and everybody brings something and like the thing I brought is empty and the thing that like uncle Frank brought is full yeah I'm just saying like just I want to make that clear that's the egg salad difference for you in case you weren't aware well that went well is no one else going to try the uh the meat and spaghetti
[151:08.46]Well, come try the pie.
[151:09.16]Let's get like a full... Pepper the pie.
[151:11.46]Yeah.
[151:12.56]I did do that.
[151:13.08]I ate the whole piece of pie you guys gave me.
[151:15.58]That pie was fine.
[151:16.54]I'm like covered in dust.
[151:17.70]No, I ate the first pie.
[151:19.52]Oh my god, Caelid just took a... Oh my goodness!
[151:23.38]What a big boy.
[151:24.00]That is bold.
[151:26.71]It's so soggy now.
[151:28.53]Yeah, that's... Is it like actually fully cooked at least?
[151:32.47]It looks like it is.
[151:39.91]Hey.
[151:44.51]Good work.
[151:45.25]Nice job.
[151:46.33]Hey, and that's tummy time for you.
[151:47.89]That's just easy, easy meals.
[151:51.01]Everyone's got a big smile on their face, food in their tummy.
[151:54.79]Jerma's got the egg salad recipe, but if you need my recipes, I'm sure I can disclose those for you if you want to make beautiful pies like this.
[152:05.15]How much protein do you think is in that?
[152:06.85]That's like probably 200 grams.
[152:08.05]That's at least 200.
[152:08.95]Is he puking?
[152:10.28]No.
[152:11.00]No, no, he's fine.
[152:12.42]Well, now that you've come this far, what do you have?
[152:15.30]You doing anything cool you want to tell them?
[152:16.90]Yeah, what are you doing coming up, Jeremiah?
[152:19.58]I'm going to dodge a battle axe on the screen.
[152:22.34]That's fucking, like, actually?
[152:24.19]I'm dodging a battle axe on camera, like on stream.
[152:26.43]Like a sharpened one?
[152:27.33]Like a real one, yeah.
[152:28.11]I feel like you're leaving out details and I wanted it more.
[152:30.76]Well, you'll have to see.
[152:32.32]When is it?
[152:33.34]Soon.
[152:35.82]I don't have a date for it, but it's coming.
[152:40.98]That'll be nice.
[152:41.68]And where can they find that, Jerma?
[152:43.40]They can find that on twitch.tv/jerma985.
[152:46.92]Well, thank you for coming on, Jerma.
[152:50.16]And thank you for the egg salad.
[152:51.68]No, this was a lot of fun.
[152:52.82]I'm happy to be here.
[152:54.12]You guys are all cool.
[152:56.08]You guys are a lot of fun.
[152:57.28]Bye, everybody.
[152:59.15]My muscles are still twitching.
[153:00.23]Happy Halloween.
[153:01.03]Did we say it?
[153:01.63]Oh, yeah.
[153:01.99]Happy Halloween.
[153:03.06]Happy Halloween.
[153:03.94]Happy Halloween.
[153:08.38]Halloween joy all around.
[153:11.37]When a bell rings, Halloween gets its wings.
[153:16.00]I don't know Halloween expressions.
[153:18.22]This thing is solid, man.
