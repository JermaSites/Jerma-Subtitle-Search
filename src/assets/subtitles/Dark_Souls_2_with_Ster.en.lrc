[00:03.22]Hello.
[00:05.32]Welcome to a stream.
[00:08.70]Y'all know who it is.
[00:09.46]Let me move this out of the way.
[00:14.27]That doesn't go there.
[00:15.43]That goes down here.
[00:20.61]Who is this imposter?
[00:21.81]What?
[00:23.53]It's me, Jeremy.
[00:27.83]Time for a GeoGuessr stream.
[00:31.05]No.
[00:32.67]How's everybody doing?
[00:33.17]I'm going to play Dark Souls 2 tonight.
[00:39.20]Figured as much because... Dark Souls Remastered was a thing.
[00:43.52]And I have the itch to play it again.
[00:47.64]So why wouldn't I do it?
[00:51.16]Why wouldn't I continue with the series?
[00:52.87]I don't think I'm going to do Dark Souls 3 though.
[00:54.25]Because we already did that.
[00:57.11]Why would I do Dark Souls 3 when you saw it like a year ago?
[01:01.76]You said more House Hunter?
[01:05.05]I know, but I wanted to... Look, here's what's going to happen.
[01:07.31]So Dark Souls 2 is tonight.
[01:09.67]I just need to know if I want to play it or not.
[01:11.57]You know, the... House... Not House Hunter.
[01:14.39]House Flipper.
[01:17.07]That is absolutely going to... I said that was going to happen next week.
[01:20.53]Oh, I'm going to puke.
[01:22.47]The emote contest was last night.
[01:25.19]Hopefully you were there.
[01:26.23]By the way, if you want to vote for the emotes, here's a convenient link.
[01:33.19]Check it out.
[01:33.89]I don't have a link for you right now.
[01:35.69]I don't have like a convenient link.
[01:37.63]I thought I had a convenient link.
[01:42.19]Whoops, I didn't make it.
[01:44.05]Get jebaited.
[01:46.27]But no, we're going to start Dark Souls 3.
[01:48.07]No, Dark Souls 2, stupid.
[01:50.49]House Flipper will come back on Tuesday.
[01:52.99]And then maybe I'll play Dark Souls 2 through the whole thing.
[01:55.29]You never know.
[01:56.39]But I'm having a lot of fun with these Souls games.
[02:00.19]So...
[02:02.28]Dark Souls 2 is the best.
[02:03.37]Give me one second while I just want to grab a drink.
[02:05.79]So give me one second.
[02:07.65]Be right back.
[02:33.51]Okay.
[02:35.56]It's been a... I have played through Dark Souls 2 before.
[02:39.44]So this is not going to be one of those scenarios where I don't really know what to do.
[02:42.52]I kind of already know what I'm doing.
[02:45.09]So I can... Hey.
[02:46.49]Hi, there we are.
[02:47.19]I already know what I'm doing, in a sense.
[02:50.89]I use that very loosely.
[02:53.08]But welcome to Dark Souls 2.
[02:55.89]I skipped the intro.
[02:58.13]I did.
[02:59.35]Because I didn't think that it was necessary considering I've already seen it.
[03:03.77]You guys have already seen it.
[03:05.35]This is Things Betwixt.
[03:08.00]Not to be confused with the candy of the same name.
[03:10.78]Twix candy, you know.
[03:13.14]Mountain Blade.
[03:13.78]I'm not going to play Mountain Blade.
[03:19.29]Wait, what?
[03:22.44]Why is there... Oh, there's no audio.
[03:24.22]You can't even hear this.
[03:25.66]That's better.
[03:28.02]Come on.
[03:29.34]Come on.
[03:31.40]Okay.
[03:33.76]So, from what I remember in Dark Souls 2, it was... Dark Souls 2 is considered to be the worst of the Souls games, from my understanding.
[03:44.31]I don't necessarily know why that is.
[03:46.87]I guess I could understand.
[03:47.71]It's kind of just a messy game that throws in and...
[03:51.14]Has no rhyme or reason to many of the areas.
[03:54.33]But... This is an imposter.
[04:00.69]You sure?
[04:02.45]You sure?
[04:02.95]You sure?
[04:03.77]Let's take a look.
[04:07.44]What are you talking about?
[04:09.46]This is an imposter.
[04:10.50]No, because the facecam is in a... I'm sick of that.
[04:14.58]I'm sick of having the full... Because you can see all the bullshit behind me.
[04:16.81]And this is more of a professional angle.
[04:19.86]I gotta start to use a better angle.
[04:21.08]It's a fake face scan.
[04:25.26]Fake facecam, not face scan.
[04:27.28]Alright, fuck it, let's go.
[04:29.00]I know the witches are in here.
[04:31.79]I know what I'm doing.
[04:32.51]You don't think I already know what I'm doing in this game?
[04:33.99]I can hear all those subs.
[04:37.93]Alright, I'll watch this cut scene.
[04:39.35]No, I won't.
[04:40.19]Fuck the witches.
[04:41.95]What seems to be the ruckus?
[04:50.10]So Dark Souls 2, from my understanding, was not made by the same people that made Dark Souls 1.
[04:57.01]Or Dark Souls 3.
[04:57.81]Or Bloodborne, for that matter.
[05:00.41]Holy shit, somebody gave $50.
[05:03.57]Thank you, Lorag.
[05:04.67]Paying $50 for... Ah, shit, I missed it.
[05:08.15]Hold on.
[05:08.89]Thank you, Lorag, for the $50.
[05:11.10]Much appreciated, dude.
[05:11.94]Seriously.
[05:14.67]Oh, this is Scholar.
[05:15.75]This is Scholar of the First Sin, by the way.
[05:17.20]I didn't mention that.
[05:18.62]This is not just the regular Dark Souls.
[05:21.02]This is Scholar of the First Sin.
[05:26.02]We're not going to do decks.
[05:27.37]I want to do something different.
[05:28.69]I want to try something a little more... Something with more finesse, as they'd say.
[05:37.29]Dark Souls 2 is so good.
[05:38.18]Where's Dark Souls 3?
[05:38.84]I already played Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[05:43.84]Should I do pyro or like sorcery or something?
[05:45.54]I'm going to do pyro.
[05:47.28]I have never done that in a Souls game.
[05:48.48]We're going to do pyro.
[05:49.38]That's fate, right?
[05:52.80]Coffee?
[05:54.42]What's up?
[05:54.78]Okay, I got a good name.
[05:58.08]This is very important because Dark Souls, you got to get the right name here.
[06:02.32]How about... I'm not going to be SilverPenne.
[06:04.66]I'm not going to be like Motivus.
[06:07.32]Yes, I am.
[06:10.24]The Dark...
[06:13.35]Mortimus.
[06:15.34]Yes.
[06:19.38]At least you know your own fucking name.
[06:24.30]Well, I reckon, Mortimus.
[06:28.96]This is not too loud, right?
[06:30.95]You guys can hear this, right?
[06:34.53]Oh, there it is.
[06:35.03]A human ifegi.
[06:38.43]And we're starting early, too.
[06:39.61]I wanted to, because it's Saturday.
[06:40.75]A lot of people are probably wondering why I wanted to start at like 4 or 5.
[06:45.53]Because starting at 7 p.m.
[06:47.59]on Saturday is a pretty bad idea.
[06:50.15]Seriously.
[06:54.51]So, I got a wicker basket here.
[06:56.17]I'm not sure what I do with it.
[06:59.45]Didn't take five hours to pick a name.
[07:00.89]No, not this time.
[07:03.41]But we are going to make a character, though.
[07:04.75]We have to make a character.
[07:05.65]Class and gift.
[07:07.27]We're going to go with Depraved, I think would be a good idea.
[07:11.25]That's not it!
[07:12.69]We're going to go with Cleric, right?
[07:16.69]Cleric is the best to do for Faith, from my understanding.
[07:20.73]Thanks for the stream.
[07:21.35]Work sucked.
[07:23.80]I'm sorry to hear that, man, but welcome to the stream.
[07:25.52]Hope you have a good time.
[07:28.14]Cleric, right?
[07:30.86]It's not ba- this is the sor- should it be sorcerer?
[07:33.26]No, this is... This is faith, right?
[07:36.89]The, the, the, the shooting symbol.
[07:38.71]Like the big explosion supernova symbol.
[07:41.97]Pyromancy scale with intelligence and faith, okay.
[07:46.91]I'm gonna assume cleric is probably the best idea.
[07:49.71]Are you incapable of reading?
[07:53.62]No, I, I, I know, I just, I've never done it before.
[07:56.56]I, I, I'm just trying to see what the, it's probably, it's gonna be cleric.
[08:02.17]relax Gift I'm gonna do a home.
[08:06.09]We're bone.
[08:06.63]No, let's do None of this matters life ring who cares?
[08:11.57]Let's do the body though.
[08:12.37]You got to make a cool character gonna make a funny care.
[08:14.21]It's gonna be a funny character It's gonna be a funny character.
[08:17.24]Are you ready?
[08:19.64]No, no, no, no, okay body gender I Don't know what's the gender reveal gonna be is it a boy or a girl?
[08:28.52]Is it a boy or a girl?
[08:29.46]Oh?
[08:30.60]It's a girl.
[08:31.42]No, it's a boy.
[08:33.19]It's a boy.
[08:35.39]Fat guy.
[08:37.81]Jacked fat guy.
[08:38.63]Let's go to face.
[08:42.47]Homeland.
[08:48.00]Bucket of luck.
[08:48.42]Alright, this guy.
[08:52.48]Let's get some cool hair.
[08:54.30]Dark Souls 2 doesn't have very good customization options.
[08:56.26]You'd say, I'm going to have to go with a bald guy.
[08:59.76]He's going to have blue hair.
[09:01.48]Actually, sorry.
[09:02.74]Let me change that.
[09:03.94]He's going to have teal hair because I'm a streamer or a YouTuber.
[09:09.04]Right?
[09:09.70]Put me in the category of Jeremy is a streamer or a YouTuber.
[09:14.31]I have to have teal hair.
[09:15.23]I have to.
[09:16.29]Otherwise, I'm not allowed to be able to be on here.
[09:19.21]Eyebrows.
[09:19.81]Scary ones.
[09:21.95]Eyebrow color.
[09:23.75]Nobody does that.
[09:26.24]Right?
[09:27.22]Think about that.
[09:29.49]I... I'm going to start a new trend.
[09:32.21]You want to talk about like a YouTuber streamer trend?
[09:35.69]I'm going to dye my eyebrows blue.
[09:37.99]That's not my hair, just my eyebrows.
[09:41.36]Who else has done that?
[09:42.10]Eye color... Just... I'm going to go with like gray, whatever.
[09:50.64]Do it.
[09:50.92]Dye your teeth.
[09:53.42]Like... Let's go with a...
[09:59.90]Clean shaped.
[10:02.26]Tattoo.
[10:03.18]Face tattoo.
[10:08.60]Is that a face tattoo?
[10:10.10]I'm not sure what that is.
[10:12.44]No, no face tattoos.
[10:15.21]That's fine.
[10:17.13]I do want to make his face really, really funny and LOL.
[10:20.47]You know what I mean?
[10:20.89]I'm going to get an LOL face here.
[10:22.11]Just watch.
[10:23.13]You'll see.
[10:27.99]Strong form, not weak.
[10:31.78]I promise you guys, if you guys don't LOL by the time that this face creation is over, then I'm not doing my job correctly.
[10:38.77]Look at it.
[10:39.29]Already.
[10:39.83]I can already see them in the chat.
[10:40.81]I can already see them.
[10:42.05]Take a look.
[10:43.07]I'm seeing lots of LOLs in this chat.
[10:48.34]Nice.
[10:50.00]Nice.
[10:53.10]No, that's not what I wanted.
[10:56.70]That's fine.
[10:57.82]Bright.
[10:58.38]That's fine.
[10:59.36]Blue.
[10:59.78]That's fine.
[11:01.04]Blue.
[11:01.48]That's fine.
[11:02.80]Blue.
[11:03.18]That's fine.
[11:04.10]Green.
[11:04.50]That's okay too.
[11:05.16]Alright, overall two.
[11:07.26]Cheek color.
[11:07.84]That's fine.
[11:08.63]Blue is fine.
[11:09.81]Laugh lines.
[11:10.51]Blue is also okay here.
[11:11.67]I got the hair there.
[11:14.75]Shape one.
[11:15.69]What?
[11:16.11]Whoa!
[11:16.63]You fucking idiot.
[11:17.89]Am I that stupid?
[11:18.65]Somebody gave $50.
[11:19.77]Jesus Christ, Jeremy.
[11:21.63]Lorag, thank you for the $50.
[11:24.36]paying $50 for chat to hear a preview of the remix I'm making of your throat singing.
[11:30.88]Absolutely.
[11:32.22]Let's take a listen.
[11:35.33]Let's see what it sounds like.
[11:41.23]Hold on, I gotta turn down Dark Souls for a second.
[11:44.47]Dark Souls has to turn off.
[11:48.97]Dark Souls 2, there we go.
[11:49.73]Alright, let's listen to the throat singing remix.
[11:51.29]Here it comes.
[12:05.85]What's going on?
[12:09.26]Oh, that's the next track.
[12:10.42]Okay, that's the next track.
[12:13.02]Jerma, I hate you.
[12:16.96]Don't say such a thing.
[12:17.82]It makes me feel bad.
[12:19.32]And yes, I know I have to get a haircut.
[12:20.89]Don't bring it up again.
[12:24.07]Don't bring it up again.
[12:26.91]You bring that up again, I swear to... I swear to the holy serpent that I will be so upset about it.
[12:33.69]I swear to the holy serpent...
[12:36.69]Alright, uh, where am I?
[12:38.53]That's a pretty good remix, dude.
[12:39.67]Thanks for the remix.
[12:40.23]Thanks for the $50, Lorag.
[12:41.31]Seriously.
[12:42.27]You have given too much money this week.
[12:44.95]You've given me more money than I would make in a week.
[12:47.83]Like, Jesus Christ, dude.
[12:50.19]That's $425.
[12:53.37]I got Lysia.
[12:54.14]Well, now you do!
[12:57.18]Don't laugh anymore.
[12:59.40]Let's get Speck over here.
[13:00.50]Thank you, Lorag.
[13:01.28]Seriously.
[13:03.39]Let's get this back online here.
[13:04.53]Okay, face.
[13:06.65]Make the face.
[13:08.61]Make the face.
[13:09.23]Okay, here we go.
[13:11.01]Facial width.
[13:13.43]No, you know what?
[13:13.89]I don't even... I want to play the game.
[13:15.47]I'm super into fucking Souls right now.
[13:17.82]You guys don't even know this.
[13:18.48]I played Dark Souls Remastered again, and I beat the game again as a different character.
[13:23.48]I can't get away from it.
[13:25.64]Let me just do like this.
[13:26.54]Let's go quick here.
[13:27.44]Eyes.
[13:27.60]Let's put them up.
[13:32.71]These are my favorite games ever and I can't deny it.
[13:35.37]That's fine.
[13:35.81]He looks like a Star Trek character.
[13:36.93]That's alright.
[13:38.21]Let's give him a small nose.
[13:40.59]Okay.
[13:42.41]He looks good.
[13:42.90]That's fine.
[13:43.24]That's a pyromaniac sorcerer.
[13:46.68]I would assume.
[13:47.16]We're not going to see his face.
[13:49.54]This is my true self.
[13:50.38]I'm ready.
[13:53.36]Why can't I... I should have made her.
[13:54.42]That would have been better.
[13:59.27]You look like the Joker.
[14:01.15]That's my favorite... That's my favorite Marvel character, so... Of course it's gonna be the Joker.
[14:07.13]That is my favorite Marvel character.
[14:10.81]You can't hear me.
[14:11.69]What?
[14:13.05]Louder.
[14:13.40]What are you talking about?
[14:17.12]You guys can hear me fine.
[14:18.14]What are you... Shut up.
[14:21.48]We can't hear you.
[14:25.48]I didn't mean shut up.
[14:26.16]I meant be quiet.
[14:29.03]That's mean to say.
[14:31.67]No, no, be quiet's also mean.
[14:33.41]Settle down.
[14:35.47]Settle down.
[14:38.19]Turn the game up?
[14:39.09]I will, I will.
[14:40.13]Just hold on a second.
[14:41.21]I gotta go get my teeth cleaned.
[14:42.33]They're looking like that recently.
[14:43.47]Have you seen that?
[14:44.89]See?
[14:47.23]Settle down.
[14:48.73]Settle down, kids.
[14:50.39]And adults.
[14:50.85]Alright, I want the spoon as a weapon.
[14:54.58]Grab a spoon.
[14:55.10]It's a spoon dagger.
[14:56.10]Backstab.
[14:56.70]130% critical strike damage.
[15:00.44]The game is actually too loud.
[15:01.72]Well... I mean, another funny thing to do is to kill these people, but why would I do that?
[15:11.61]Look, I know what's up the stairs.
[15:12.59]I've played this game before.
[15:13.63]That's the thing.
[15:14.17]That's why I don't like doing this.
[15:16.09]I've actually played this whole thing before.
[15:17.64]You're gonna see a breezy, breezy playthrough here, guys.
[15:21.70]I'm not even kidding.
[15:22.32]I beat this game like four times.
[15:28.52]The thing is, I don't know what this does.
[15:29.86]Is that a heal?
[15:32.30]Are they not even going to give me a weapon?
[15:36.96]Okay, I was going to say, fuck this game.
[15:38.75]Okay, that's fine.
[15:40.11]Got to hold it in two hands.
[15:43.17]This is not pre-recorded, actually.
[15:45.99]Why would this be pre-recorded?
[15:50.09]Dark Souls 2 looks better than I remember.
[15:54.80]I have to hold it in two hands, otherwise...
[15:57.90]There's a mid-game weapon.
[15:58.88]Do you start with, like, a good weapon in this game?
[16:00.68]As a Pyromancer or Cleric?
[16:07.04]Now, I know you have to go to Majula, right?
[16:09.82]That's the name of the place.
[16:11.35]Oh, the game is so fucking low.
[16:12.81]I know.
[16:13.15]I'm such a fucking idiot.
[16:15.83]You can hear the game very well.
[16:18.27]It's my first time ever streaming, guys.
[16:19.55]I'm sorry.
[16:20.11]I just started.
[16:26.00]Soul of the Lost Undead and a Torch.
[16:28.48]That's a weird way to two-hand something, by the way.
[16:30.26]Alright, let's go.
[16:32.94]There's a series of tutorial areas here.
[16:34.70]Not like it matters.
[16:39.18]Although, I think there's items I can get.
[16:40.74]Maybe I should just go.
[16:41.44]Let's see if I can remember how to play Dark Souls.
[16:44.84]Apparently not.
[16:47.64]The one thing I remember hating about Dark Souls 2, I fucking hated it, was the fact that when you lock onto somebody, look what the camera does.
[16:57.11]I hate that shit.
[16:59.36]It points the camera down like this.
[17:01.56]It's too close.
[17:04.80]I remember not liking this at all.
[17:08.00]And every enemy has a magnet to your body.
[17:10.97]Like, watch what I'm talking about here.
[17:12.03]I mean, that wasn't a pretty good indicator, but, you know, whatever.
[17:15.07]It still doesn't matter.
[17:15.71]153 damage?
[17:18.41]Why am I doing so much damage?
[17:20.79]Stop swearing.
[17:21.37]I won't swear for the rest of the stream.
[17:23.74]If I swear one more time...
[17:28.44]Then you got it.
[17:32.63]You guys can see the game pretty well, right?
[17:35.43]I hope so.
[17:38.91]There we go.
[17:39.31]Dagger.
[17:39.67]I'm not going to use it.
[17:40.63]Let's just get back out there and go to Majula.
[17:42.79]Before I waste any more time here.
[17:47.54]I hate that camera.
[17:48.28]I already hate this game.
[17:52.82]I'm doing a lot of fucking damage though.
[17:58.19]quite a bit so I gotta go to the forest of lost giants right or something like that the lost forest of the giants did I swear no I didn't I said crap I said oh crap
[18:20.54]You're doing a lot of damage, you say.
[18:21.66]Yeah, I mean, I am.
[18:23.28]What's this tutorial want me to do?
[18:24.62]Why am I doing the tutorial of Dark Souls 2?
[18:27.32]I know how to play the game.
[18:29.70]I know what I'm doing.
[18:30.34]Just get me out.
[18:35.71]That bird's fucking dead.
[18:36.97]I'm not dealing with the bird right now.
[18:40.29]I already know how to play the game.
[18:41.63]I don't need to do the tutorial.
[18:42.61]I'm getting out of here.
[18:45.60]I don't need to stretch this stream.
[18:47.38]I'm going to spend like 45 minutes in the tutorial.
[18:50.06]No, get out of here.
[18:51.90]Jeremy, seriously.
[18:54.08]No, I can't even go through there.
[18:55.02]You need like the stick to go in there.
[18:57.62]I'm out of here.
[18:58.59]I'm getting out of here.
[19:01.23]Is this the back of the way that I came?
[19:02.23]If it is, then you're going to hear me scream as loud as I can.
[19:06.63]No, there's a little thing here.
[19:07.95]Sadness ahead.
[19:10.47]Boulder ahead.
[19:11.91]No.
[19:12.35]No, I went the right way.
[19:13.49]So I got heal equipped.
[19:15.44]As a man of faith.
[19:17.74]Alright, let's get out of here.
[19:21.36]Alright, here's a Majula.
[19:24.64]All I really need to do here is touch the bonfire and then go to the Forest of Lost Souls.
[19:30.15]Or Lost Giants, whatever it is.
[19:34.99]The game is the best DLC.
[19:35.71]Um...
[19:39.96]yeah I mean I look as much I'm gonna joke around about Dark Souls 2 being a bad game I enjoyed it I mean it was a it's a it's a little messy but the game is still fun I don't think it's better than any of the other ones but it's still a fun game a little messy just a little am I going to read a walkthrough no I've already played this game I know where to go
[20:05.95]We all know this lady, Bayer of the Curse.
[20:07.89]She gave me an Estus Flask.
[20:10.30]I can level up now.
[20:12.54]Not like it matters.
[20:13.20]You guys already know the story.
[20:16.00]Sif and Gwyff had a child and that turned into Gwynf.
[20:19.18]And then Gwynf had a baby named Gwyn.
[20:20.71]And then Gwyndolin came out of him.
[20:22.87]And then you ended up with a story where you had to relight the fire.
[20:25.65]And if you didn't light the fire, then the whole world ends.
[20:28.47]And you become the king of nothing.
[20:30.19]So we lit the fire.
[20:31.37]The story continues.
[20:33.07]The canon is that you lit the fire.
[20:34.69]Fire burns out.
[20:36.05]Frampto ends up eating...
[20:37.81]the stone and ends up dying he shits it out and it explodes and makes a supernova making Dark Souls to the new world that comes out of the explosion so that's the canon beginning and end of Dark Souls one uh so now I I got I'm ready to go I got my Estus Flask let's equip it why don't we how's only one flask here this game's fun
[21:05.10]It makes sense now.
[21:05.72]Alright, let's go.
[21:06.80]I already know where I'm going.
[21:09.90]See, I'm going to be one of those streamers that you've seen that plays this game that knows what they're doing.
[21:13.83]And where they're going.
[21:15.87]Oh, I don't know shit.
[21:17.17]Where do I go from here?
[21:18.27]What do I do from here?
[21:19.27]It's called, I already know.
[21:22.94]Where do I go?
[21:23.58]I wonder, Jeremy.
[21:25.38]I don't know about the secret item.
[21:29.38]Yes, I do.
[21:29.90]You have to put the ring on and the cat ring and then you fall down.
[21:40.16]I knew that was gonna happen.
[21:40.80]I was just wasting time.
[21:42.20]Alright, I missed the 1-up.
[21:43.06]It don't matter.
[21:43.52]This is gonna bring us to the Forest of Forgotten Legends of the Hidden Temple.
[21:52.07]I haven't died yet.
[21:55.51]What do you mean death counter?
[21:56.73]There's been no death.
[21:58.43]Forest of Fallen Giants.
[22:01.98]I'm going to... Remember, this is Scholar of the Lost Souls.
[22:06.24]So everything sucks.
[22:10.42]Remember, the whole game is bad.
[22:11.94]So don't blame it on me.
[22:12.68]I'm not even going to fight this guy.
[22:16.40]What a waste of time.
[22:18.23]I should know that by now.
[22:21.55]If you don't know about Scholar of the First Sins, every enemy has 100% more health and every boss does 40% more damage.
[22:28.69]That's how they made it.
[22:29.39]I don't know why they did it like that.
[22:34.57]Fucking life gem, seriously.
[22:38.81]Honestly, they may as well.
[22:40.21]I remember hating this part.
[22:41.29]I'm not even gonna... Why fight him?
[22:42.45]Just go.
[22:45.30]So they made it better?
[22:46.28]No, no.
[22:46.96]They... Scholar, they put random people in random places.
[22:51.58]They added, like, a bunch of turtle enemies.
[22:53.06]They were like, oh yeah, this area was pretty well balanced.
[22:56.88]Why don't we put a bunch of shit here that's not... Alright, I gotta... I'm not... I'm fucking... I gotta stop talking.
[23:02.62]Oh my god, what have I done?
[23:11.05]Pretty good start.
[23:20.62]Alright, we got it out of the way.
[23:23.92]It's out of the way.
[23:24.74]I can play the game now.
[23:25.44]Let's go.
[23:27.04]Don't fight the huge guy.
[23:27.93]There's no reason to.
[23:28.67]Don't be a fucking idiot.
[23:31.23]I know.
[23:31.67]I do know what I'm doing.
[23:32.87]I know what I'm fucking doing.
[23:34.43]Everyone wants to do.
[23:35.05]Oh, you don't know what you're doing.
[23:39.13]Over here.
[23:47.33]It's really not that hard.
[23:48.87]I just can't be a fucking idiot this time.
[23:53.61]What is happening?
[23:55.79]Window.
[23:56.15]Turkey and window.
[23:59.75]Now look out for the fucking turkey.
[24:01.51]And now I missed my train.
[24:06.72]I missed the train.
[24:07.46]That's great.
[24:08.66]Thanks, guys.
[24:15.26]Jebaited, yeah.
[24:17.73]I'm gonna fucking pat, you know, if I wasn't moving, I would actually pave over this window with cement.
[24:25.56]Seriously.
[24:29.44]There it is, there it is.
[24:30.28]What do you mean, there it is?
[24:35.47]Did something, I don't understand, what happened over here?
[24:39.19]Hold on.
[24:47.48]There's nothing out there.
[24:49.62]You probably... You know, you may... One of my neighbors... I think there's... Somebody's actually been over here.
[24:55.67]Either a landscaper... I don't know who the fuck it is, but they've been... It's probably a landscaper.
[24:58.95]I'm not even kidding.
[25:01.15]Because... Over the last six months, I feel like they've been doing work over there.
[25:06.44]So, you might see, like, a landscaper.
[25:09.28]That's so weird.
[25:11.02]I almost want... I think I'm going to turn the camera away.
[25:13.28]Because that's... That's... I don't want to, like, show some random fucking landscaper.
[25:19.43]That would probably be bad.
[25:21.10]Alright, no fucking around.
[25:21.90]I'll get my souls.
[25:24.94]Turn the camera to breathe in.
[25:26.26]I don't think... What the fuck was that?
[25:30.59]Why am I getting my souls?
[25:31.71]I don't even need to do that.
[25:34.19]That's the most meaningless fucking thing I could do.
[25:36.39]Just get up the ladder.
[25:37.19]That's all I remember.
[25:37.89]I played this game before.
[25:38.77]I know what I'm doing.
[25:45.05]Don't fuck with the hide knight, although I could.
[25:47.51]Can't I get a weapon here?
[25:49.79]Get away from me, please.
[25:51.99]Oh, good.
[25:52.35]Fine.
[25:52.61]All of you just trickle up here.
[25:53.87]I could care less.
[25:57.49]Actually, it's a good thing I turned around.
[25:58.83]Because they're just funneling up here now.
[26:03.11]The fat guy can't climb this, can he?
[26:11.72]Fucking Jesus.
[26:15.03]Where did you come from?
[26:18.54]Missed the first bonfire already.
[26:20.14]No, I did not.
[26:21.38]Easy.
[26:24.12]What the fuck was that?
[26:25.10]Why did I just try to parry this guy?
[26:26.38]Alright, we're fine.
[26:33.87]Nice parry.
[26:34.55]I didn't... Hold on.
[26:37.03]In Dark Souls 2, you can parry.
[26:40.31]Can I actually parry with two hands?
[26:42.25]Alright, don't fuck this up.
[26:46.42]I want to see if I can parry this.
[26:48.24]You can do a two-handed parry.
[26:51.28]Holy shit, I did not know you could do that.
[26:55.04]That's good to know.
[26:55.70]Wow, what a fucking incredible game.
[26:59.72]Put this to the top of the list, man.
[27:01.14]Seriously.
[27:05.06]Why are you targeting that guy?
[27:06.40]Of all the people to target right now.
[27:07.64]I could fucking die again, I swear to God.
[27:22.93]Why are they everywhere?
[27:23.93]Why are they everywhere?
[27:24.69]Is this Scholar?
[27:25.35]Is this the Scholar of the First Sin thing?
[27:30.27]What's going on?
[27:30.93]Why is Scholar of the First Sin doing this to me?
[27:35.45]What the fuck are they coming from?
[27:37.89]Where are they coming from?
[27:49.34]I can wait.
[28:01.33]Uh, bad fucking time for a phone call.
[28:07.12]I can't fucking take this right now.
[28:10.14]Hello?
[28:10.62]Yes.
[28:17.41]Okay, what the fuck is calling me?
[28:19.51]Oh, hold on a second.
[28:20.49]I need to get to a safe area.
[28:21.51]Just hold on.
[28:25.99]Okay.
[28:31.15]I think this is one of my buddies pranking me right now.
[28:32.71]Hold on.
[28:34.55]Just wait.
[28:40.99]I'm getting call- Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[28:42.47]Hello.
[28:42.75]Hold on.
[28:43.01]Wait, wait, wait.
[28:43.67]What?
[28:44.92]Is this the same blocked fucking number?
[28:55.40]What the fuck are you saying?
[28:56.94]I can't even understand you.
[29:06.93]I went the wrong way and pyromancy is bad.
[29:12.95]Fucking hang up.
[29:13.83]I don't know who the fuck that is.
[29:15.49]That's actually really concerning because... Oh, great.
[29:18.40]Somebody has my phone number now.
[29:19.34]That's fucking fantastic.
[29:27.26]Great.
[29:31.85]I'm really glad another one of you guys has my phone number.
[29:39.42]Gotta change that now.
[29:40.32]That's fucking fantastic.
[29:41.56]Thanks, guys.
[29:50.38]I'm filled with fucking some kind of rage right now, man.
[29:52.42]Like, you want, like, goddamn privacy and you can't get it anymore.
[30:00.56]That was a blocked number, and that, that's, I'm not, but honestly, here's like the fucking annoying part.
[30:05.68]That same person, I haven't talked about it on stream, has called at least 10 to 15 times over the last six months.
[30:18.83]But, you know.
[30:20.89]You know, you're a top 1,000 streamer.
[30:24.45]Shit can just happen, apparently.
[30:26.49]For some reason.
[30:28.40]Alright, um, let's hopefully be done with that.
[30:31.38]Hey.
[30:33.36]Fuck.
[30:39.73]I'm, like, fucking freaking out about the fact that somebody just called me, so... Sorry if I'm not playing so well.
[30:56.10]Fuck you, game.
[31:01.85]No, don't kill me here!
[31:10.43]Life gem it again.
[31:11.03]Come on.
[31:11.65]Somebody's throwing the bombs.
[31:12.56]I remember this.
[31:13.00]There's a bonfire like right over here.
[31:16.18]Just get me up there.
[31:21.66]Relax with House Flipper.
[31:22.80]I don't need to do that yet.
[31:23.92]Not yet.
[31:27.52]I forgot this is Scholar.
[31:29.04]They put enemies in random locations.
[31:36.30]I need more stamina.
[31:37.00]Endurance.
[31:37.56]What do I have for endurance?
[31:38.50]It's probably terrible.
[31:48.04]This is the first bonfire, I believe.
[31:52.70]A big guy says this is a pre-recorded stream.
[31:57.16]I don't know why you think that.
[31:59.44]For some reason.
[32:02.58]Hydrate.
[32:07.41]One guy said that.
[32:08.27]I told you, at some point, you're gonna be the one guy that gets to address me.
[32:20.06]Woman.
[32:20.36]There's a woman.
[32:22.81]Oh, no.
[32:23.09]What guy with a random woman?
[32:28.61]I think I have to buy a key from this lady, right?
[32:32.69]From my understanding.
[32:37.28]Enemy spy is in the red base.
[32:40.34]It's the second bonfire.
[32:41.28]You missed the first one.
[32:43.54]Did I actually miss the first bonfire?
[32:45.36]Is that even possible?
[32:48.39]I'm not doing.
[32:49.11]I am not doing.
[32:51.51]Absolutely not.
[32:52.63]I'm not doing another Kestis run.
[32:56.05]Fuck that shit.
[32:56.97]Should I level up?
[33:03.00]Yeah, I'm going to go travel.
[33:03.76]Let's travel to Majula.
[33:05.74]Let's level up.
[33:11.04]First bonfire, it's right after the hallway with the lever.
[33:15.00]It's all good.
[33:16.36]But I do want... Where's the pyromancy person?
[33:20.00]Do they exist?
[33:24.29]Because I should just put points into faith, right?
[33:27.99]No, no, no, no, no.
[33:28.73]Give me endurance.
[33:29.55]THREE ENDURANCE!
[33:33.97]This is the worst character you could make!
[33:36.73]Oh my god, that's why I can't do anything.
[33:39.98]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[33:42.10]Three Endurance.
[33:47.62]Un-fucking-believable.
[33:48.64]Alright, Forest of the Fallen Giants.
[33:49.92]There it is.
[33:57.31]Of course I picked Cleric, and that's just great.
[34:00.63]Picked the Cleric.
[34:02.65]Why didn't I just do Depravid and be done with it?
[34:06.47]I'm gonna try Parry.
[34:15.85]Fucking Jesus Christ, man.
[34:17.15]Seriously?
[34:34.14]Yeah?
[34:46.52]I need to, I need to go back to the bonfire.
[34:48.72]Are you, are you actually fucking doing this right now?
[34:52.85]So you're telling me that I can go back to the bonfire, that first one, and there's a, there's an illusion?
[35:06.48]I'm not gonna let you backseat me and prank me!
[35:15.73]Fucking loser.
[35:17.01]God damn it.
[35:20.47]I'm going to let some prank caller backseat me.
[35:22.17]That's great.
[35:23.57]I don't fucking even care what he said.
[35:24.96]I'm going to learn how to parry.
[35:29.50]There we go.
[35:29.90]Got it.
[35:34.60]Block the number.
[35:36.52]It's coming from a number that I can't tell what it is.
[35:40.21]It's coming from a private number.
[35:45.92]Somebody's having some fucking fun and that's great.
[35:48.58]Oh, Jeremy sucks at everything.
[35:49.80]Jeremy sucks at Dark Souls.
[35:50.93]Let's get his personal phone number and call him.
[35:53.83]And tell him how bad he is.
[35:56.15]And let's backseat him over the fucking phone.
[35:58.09]That's great.
[35:58.71]Thanks a lot, man.
[35:59.37]Alright, where do I go from here?
[36:15.35]Up this way, I think, right?
[36:16.37]Because then I can go down.
[36:22.49]Yeah, I can drop down from here.
[36:25.11]So this looks like an interesting way to go.
[36:27.51]From my understanding, I can get some items here.
[36:29.12]Which will take me to... The first boss is like a giant, right?
[36:49.80]It's just very fucking distracting.
[36:51.20]I don't think you guys understand, like, how annoying it is to know.
[36:54.54]Somebody's fucking, like, calling me.
[36:57.90]Uh-oh.
[37:00.71]Let's try that again.
[37:02.83]So, down from here.
[37:08.21]To here.
[37:09.51]Thank god there's falling R1s in this game.
[37:11.22]Not like there are in Demon's Souls, because they don't exist.
[37:17.62]Alright, watch out.
[37:19.86]Parry.
[37:25.55]I'm gonna parry.
[37:26.17]I'm gonna learn how to fucking parry.
[37:27.43]You better believe it.
[37:32.67]Parry.
[37:33.37]Learn to parry.
[37:34.77]Jesus Christ.
[37:48.48]Yeah, this is, uh, this is, uh, Papa Geno's.
[37:51.28]How can I help you?
[37:58.45]There's nothing down here.
[38:00.73]Alright, this is starting to become a real fucking pain in the ass.
[38:05.18]Don't go down here, you said.
[38:15.54]Alright, I'm not gonna do that.
[38:18.41]I'm gonna go down here.
[38:21.59]I'm gonna clear the enemies here.
[38:24.11]Look, I don't have to fucking listen to you because you're just a prank caller being an asshole.
[38:27.09]So I'm gonna go down here and get the items because the items are important.
[38:33.16]And now look what you're doing.
[38:35.20]You're doing a great job here helping me.
[38:37.68]Mr. fucking mystery man.
[38:46.85]What the fuck are you saying?
[38:48.30]I can't understand you.
[38:52.44]You have to speak clearly.
[38:53.58]I cannot hear what you're saying.
[38:57.50]You hang up on me.
[39:02.26]What the fuck is... Yo, yo, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[39:14.91]What?
[39:15.35]Can I help you?
[39:22.64]Hello, I gotta go down the bonfire.
[39:26.84]To go to the ladder.
[39:27.64]Okay.
[39:31.10]Okay, so go down the ladder in this room.
[39:35.77]You got it, man.
[39:37.23]Down the ladder.
[39:38.41]Okay.
[39:44.79]That's fine.
[39:45.21]Okay, pyromancy is not good apparently, but... Uh, please shut the window.
[39:51.84]Yes.
[39:53.34]Why do you have one of these fucking iPhone 7s?
[39:55.18]Alright, I'm gonna try.
[39:58.10]I'm gonna just... Hold on here.
[40:00.51]You're kind of breathing down my neck a little bit.
[40:01.69]Can you stand back?
[40:02.27]Go down here.
[40:04.13]Like, down this way.
[40:09.99]It's hard to fucking understand you.
[40:14.33]Listen, it's hard to listen to somebody and play a game at the same time.
[40:19.78]I have played this game before, but you have to understand.
[40:22.22]It's been a while.
[40:22.76]It's been like a couple... So go down here.
[40:24.40]What do you mean no?
[40:26.14]This is where the last bonfire is.
[40:33.36]Can I at least fucking... Well, I died.
[40:38.56]So that's when you're breathing down somebody's neck and you're fucking screaming orders at them.
[40:48.08]Outlast 1, the second one was terrible.
[40:49.82]Can I ask you what the fuck you're doing here?
[40:51.74]I'm trying to help you.
[40:54.34]Okay, so you decide to break into my fucking house with your goddamn walkie-talkie system, and you're gonna try to come here, you're gonna try to tell me how to play my game on my own stream.
[41:03.95]Is that what you're trying to tell me?
[41:04.79]Is that what this is?
[41:05.41]Yes.
[41:06.89]Okay, well, go ahead and tell us.
[41:08.49]Tell us where we should go.
[41:09.35]Go ahead.
[41:10.01]I'm trying to help you.
[41:16.40]I gotta go find the pursuer down here on the ladder Alright up this is where you want me to go up here This is where you want me to go
[41:47.17]No, I need to at least try.
[41:48.41]Where do I go?
[41:48.91]Down the stairs.
[41:52.63]Let me, let me, shut up!
[41:53.69]Let me parry this guy.
[41:54.57]I can get it right.
[41:55.19]This is my stream.
[42:00.77]You do it.
[42:01.13]Fucking fine.
[42:01.77]You do it.
[42:02.77]You do it, Mr. Mystery Man.
[42:03.67]Go ahead.
[42:04.32]You do it.
[42:05.46]You fucking do it.
[42:06.96]You're so good at this.
[42:08.06]Apparently you're so good at this.
[42:09.86]You do it then.
[42:11.08]Mr. Mystery Man.
[42:15.38]I'm gonna get that through you.
[42:18.00]I missed the Estus in the well.
[42:19.84]Yeah, it was you.
[42:22.10]It's the first thing you do.
[42:25.88]But I have not played this game.
[42:27.99]You started and started and you played this.
[42:33.65]Where the fuck are you going?
[42:35.33]You go over here and you hit the rock.
[42:42.66]Can I ask you what you think, you think it's okay to come in somebody's house when they're in the middle of a livestream?
[42:47.68]I'm making it better.
[42:49.56]Everyone wanted me to get that.
[42:52.72]So what does that do?
[42:53.69]That's bullshit.
[42:56.69]Oh, look at you.
[42:57.79]Look at that.
[42:58.41]Not, uh... You forgot to buy a cat ring.
[43:01.97]You died there.
[43:02.77]You died there somehow.
[43:03.73]Not sure how that happened.
[43:04.91]This controller is not, like, so sticky.
[43:09.63]Oh, but I thought I couldn't do it, so apparently you can.
[43:14.21]It's different.
[43:16.35]Right, okay.
[43:18.63]So where are you off to now?
[43:19.82]Now that you showed me up on my own stream.
[43:22.74]It's easier to do this boss first.
[43:27.06]Okay, do that boss first.
[43:28.64]Hey, can I get you something?
[43:29.40]Can I get you like a drink or something?
[43:30.38]You want like a water?
[43:31.10]I don't want any water.
[43:33.98]Okay, you want a water?
[43:35.26]I'm going to go get you a water right now.
[43:37.18]Thank you.
[43:41.12]Go and get your water.
[43:42.56]Be good to God.
[43:43.46]Thank God that lizard is leaving.
[43:47.50]I'm getting you.
[43:50.30]I'm getting you water.
[43:51.46]Oh, yeah.
[43:53.76]I'm so sick of him.
[43:57.00]I'm dying for a big son of a spider lizard.
[44:01.89]He's such a loser.
[44:21.14]Are you fucking for real?
[44:22.57]Are you seriously?
[44:23.83]Are you seriously here right now?
[44:25.77]You got me.
[44:27.69]I'm sorry, dude.
[44:28.37]I just... Un-fucking-believable.
[44:32.65]You've had my calls blocked.
[44:34.17]I couldn't... I'm here all the time.
[44:36.35]There's a reason why I have your calls blocked.
[44:38.05]First of all...
[44:40.02]Illegal.
[44:40.74]Illegal.
[44:41.12]First of all, illegal, right?
[44:42.86]Absolutely fucking illegal.
[44:44.37]You're going to come in here, open the door to my house, and come on in the side door.
[44:49.05]I mean, I use this too, but not as often as you do.
[44:51.41]Look, just you've been ignoring me for so long, I figured I wanted to be part of the stream and you're having fun, but if I'm in chat, then someone will notice me, and they'll be like, it's him again.
[45:02.60]There are much better ways to do this.
[45:05.91]Why are you here right now?
[45:07.89]This is something weird.
[45:08.85]Okay, if we're going to get to the bottom of this, we're seriously right now?
[45:12.43]You want to seriously right now get to the bottom of this?
[45:14.30]Move out of the way.
[45:15.44]You're bumping into all my shit.
[45:18.06]You owe me so much money.
[45:20.46]It's money.
[45:21.02]I've been trying to get this money back.
[45:22.26]I keep calling you.
[45:23.20]I've been around the house.
[45:24.06]I've sent subpoenas over, I think.
[45:27.89]Oh, you've got... Hold on.
[45:29.75]This is way more important than Dark Souls, by the way.
[45:32.07]You've sent subpoenas.
[45:34.04]Yeah.
[45:34.48]To where?
[45:35.44]I called you to court.
[45:36.54]You owe me, like, $100,000.
[45:38.78]Okay, yeah.
[45:40.76]There it is, guys.
[45:41.94]That's what he's doing here.
[45:43.56]Okay, $100,000.
[45:44.72]And can I ask you, can I ask you, by the way, what that's for?
[45:48.39]$100,000.
[45:50.15]You don't even remember.
[45:50.99]No, I don't.
[45:51.97]It's even more messed up that you don't even remember.
[45:54.49]You remember...
[45:55.66]I don't know, maybe like a year, two months ago, somewhere around there.
[45:59.00]I don't know the exact date.
[46:00.34]Right.
[46:00.52]It's in my phone.
[46:02.38]Right, right.
[46:04.32]So you're saying, I have no recollection of me owing you that much money.
[46:08.50]Me and you went out to lunch.
[46:09.48]Yes.
[46:10.10]You ordered pizza.
[46:12.07]I ordered a few pizzas.
[46:13.85]So I ordered pizzas.
[46:15.39]And then you left and you didn't pick up the bill.
[46:17.29]Okay.
[46:17.63]And the bill was $100,000 fucking dollars.
[46:19.91]Two U-Haul trucks show up full of pizza.
[46:23.06]Okay.
[46:23.58]Alright.
[46:24.78]So this is what we're talking about now.
[46:26.70]He wants the almighty dollar.
[46:28.54]This is what he's here for.
[46:29.58]This whole time he still has the money.
[46:31.16]He's here for money.
[46:32.47]And he knows!
[46:33.27]I've got fucking 700 million bits!
[46:34.95]He knows I have it, and he's here to take it from me, right?
[46:37.23]So, oh yes, okay, so sorry.
[46:39.07]Sorry, guys!
[46:39.87]Oh, I make so much money with cryptocurrency!
[46:42.81]It's because you never pay me back!
[46:44.96]Anything we've ever done!
[46:46.10]Jerma Rumble?
[46:47.16]Oh, it cost so much money for me to... Where did that money come from?
[46:50.80]Took out a loan!
[46:51.48]I took out a loan!
[46:52.20]From a small loan of $4,000.
[46:53.86]From who?
[46:54.32]I don't remember.
[47:01.56]It was from somebody that I knew.
[47:02.96]The bank.
[47:04.38]It was from the bank.
[47:05.05]It was me.
[47:05.65]Okay, well, hold on a minute.
[47:06.91]Wait a minute.
[47:07.43]So you're telling me, first of all, you're telling me, oh, that's a great, almighty green, right?
[47:11.83]You're here for this.
[47:13.31]And for some reason, yeah, it's clean.
[47:15.62]It smells wonderful.
[47:16.88]How much do you want for me to get you the fuck out of my life?
[47:19.68]Because, seriously, we had a Jerma and Star Convention planned.
[47:22.86]Oh, my God.
[47:23.58]The Jerma start the Jerma start.
[47:25.38]I don't want to hear about this convention again, right?
[47:26.99]This convention was a failure from the start I said we should never do it and still I front half the money you fronted $50,000.
[47:33.21]I didn't want to pay for any of it I told you I don't want to pay a cent for the Jerma star convention We're gonna do a Minecraft Hunger Games thing.
[47:39.09]What a disaster.
[47:39.91]Why would we do that?
[47:41.23]Absolutely fucking absolutely into it
[47:45.32]Do you know what interest is?
[47:46.22]Okay, there you go.
[47:46.74]Take it.
[47:46.90]Give me, give me.
[47:47.58]Yeah, take it.
[47:48.24]Go, take it.
[47:49.30]This?
[47:50.45]That's it.
[47:50.73]That's enough.
[47:51.25]That's enough of what I owe you.
[47:52.79]$10,000.
[47:52.81]That's it.
[47:53.33]This is fucking chump change compared to what you owe me.
[47:56.61]How much fucking money do you want, huh?
[47:58.45]How much money is it going to take to get you the fuck away from me?
[48:01.98]Is it going to take 60,000?
[48:02.66]Is it going to take fucking 70,000?
[48:05.30]How much is it going to take for you to leave me alone?
[48:06.68]The rest of it.
[48:07.04]The rest of it.
[48:07.54]The rest of it.
[48:08.88]You know that's mine.
[48:10.02]You're just fucking acting tough on your stream.
[48:12.42]Oh, tough?
[48:13.06]You want to talk about tough guy breaking into my house?
[48:15.64]Okay.
[48:16.00]I didn't... Yeah, alright.
[48:18.30]You didn't get to a single boss in Dark Souls 2.
[48:20.54]I've played this before.
[48:21.56]Thank you.
[48:22.60]Fine.
[48:22.90]You want to fucking come in and rock me blind?
[48:25.07]It's not robbing if it belongs to me.
[48:26.70]Can you just make one right here?
[48:27.78]Listen, just focus on this money for a second here.
[48:30.98]You need to look at it closely because you need to remember that money has nothing to do with friendship, okay?
[48:36.10]Just because I may have ordered 4,000 pizzas to a convention that nobody came to, we thought we were way more popular than we actually were, right?
[48:42.90]No one showed up.
[48:43.50]Nobody fucking showed up.
[48:44.48]It was bad.
[48:45.16]And I had to front like at least $200 of that and you had about 80 grand.
[48:49.13]But $200 is a lot of money, okay?
[48:51.71]First of all.
[48:52.69]you think one person would show up nobody showed up you know I'm sorry it's fine like thank you only one was the money that's all of it you want to count it do you want to count that make sure that you took a hundred thousand okay it's all in there you can count it so we good
[49:12.15]I think so.
[49:12.57]I mean, you got what you came for.
[49:15.67]I'm pretty sure that's, you know, you came and you sure did cry.
[49:20.84]You sure did give the waterworks here and you cried on my stream.
[49:24.14]Oh, waterworks.
[49:26.24]I was going to go to the water park right after this.
[49:28.33]You want to come?
[49:30.75]Were you going to the water park?
[49:31.87]Yeah, the water park.
[49:33.03]It's like...
[49:34.20]I don't know, not that far.
[49:35.42]I was on my way, and you started streaming, and I was like, I might as well stop by and, you know, walk by his window a few times.
[49:41.59]Bro!
[49:42.73]Bro, I ain't been in a water park in, like, six months.
[49:45.21]What time is it?

[50:07.51]You gotta be careful.
[50:08.11]The sunscreen, you gotta get sunscreen on that face.

[50:12.63]I'm ready.
[50:12.99]I mean, you only got another, like, hour of sunshine, but you really gotta make it count.

[50:42.50]It's gonna be fun.
[50:43.68]So, we gotta go.
[50:45.50]I'm sorry, guys.
[50:46.18]Stream has to end here.
[50:47.72]Waterpark, going down a slide.
[50:50.18]I can't fucking wait.
[50:51.40]And you know what?
[50:52.38]Hey, it's on me.
