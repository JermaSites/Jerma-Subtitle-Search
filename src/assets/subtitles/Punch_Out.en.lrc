[01:07.81]Hi, guys.
[01:10.49]See, we started early.
[01:11.43]7.29, that's what it said, right?
[01:16.06]Ah, shit.
[01:16.38]Hold on a second.
[01:17.00]I need to get rid of the 7.30 start.
[01:19.24]Like that.
[01:19.44]And update it.
[01:30.61]But I hope you had a good, uh, weekend.
[01:32.61]A new year weekend.
[01:34.59]Where is 2017?
[01:35.84]New year!
[01:37.80]New you!
[01:40.96]I'm looking forward to this year.
[01:43.60]I'm gonna get shit done.

[01:55.61]I am.
[01:57.37]But it's okay.
[01:59.76]I didn't really have a plan.
[02:01.60]Wait, what?
[02:04.54]I have a plan now.
[02:06.76]That is for sure.
[02:10.82]Wait, what?
[02:11.16]Wait, what?
[02:31.35]OK.
[02:55.82]Hey, holy mackerel the third.
[02:57.80]Welcome back for 11 months, dude.
[02:59.96]Day 97 in the attic.
[03:01.84]The Christmas decorations have returned to me, but turned bitter by a recent event.
[03:04.73]Santa Claus appears to be chewed up by Otto.
[03:07.15]He hasn't been the same.
[03:09.75]Thanks a lot, dude.
[03:13.59]Thank you, Sergeant Dengas, what's up?
[03:15.87]Eight rabbits for 10 months.

[03:22.22]And Captain Narwhal.
[03:25.00]Welcome back, guys.
[03:27.54]Okay, I'm going to switch over now to the game.
[03:32.40]We're going to play like two or three different punch-outs tonight.
[03:36.17]Yeah, how angry I get, you know.
[03:38.03]They might immediately might stop.
[03:39.97]Why have I... Oh, I'm going to reset this.
[03:48.57]Yes, there is going to be a facecam tonight, but not for this, not for right now.
[03:52.43]It's not necessary right now.
[03:56.09]So, hey.
[04:03.89]Uh, did it work?
[04:08.08]I guess?
[04:11.74]It did.
[04:12.04]Alright.
[04:13.54]So, we're going to start with the original punch-out.
[04:16.40]And then we're going to move on to full facecam, full-on boxing mode.
[04:22.57]And if you're wondering, hey, hey, J-Jerma, why are you doing this?
[04:24.72]Why are you starting with the first punch-out ever?
[04:29.08]It's because the first one's still downloading.
[04:31.62]The one I wanted to play is still downloading, so we have to play this one first.
[04:36.53]I wasn't prepared.
[04:37.39]I've been like, I have, the holidays have been fucking all over the place.
[04:42.79]I've been very busy.

[05:11.71]Thanks Do a blindfold run?
[05:18.42]Actually, a lot of cool things have come out recently.
[05:23.68]It's a new game.
[05:24.20]I saw the Happy New Year clip.
[05:27.32]Yeah, that was like right with the... I ripped out my phone.
[05:30.02]I tried to get it right when the ball dropped, but I was late.
[05:34.17]I glass Joe.
[05:36.17]He's 1 in 99.
[05:36.69]It kind of looks like me.
[05:39.01]Hey, he's 38 too.
[05:40.35]Me and this guy are like the same age.
[05:43.55]I'm pretty much going to beat the shit out of myself in like six or seven years.
[05:48.89]You need facecam for this?
[05:50.05]No you don't!
[05:52.01]Is it loud?
[05:52.51]How loud is it?
[05:55.88]Go all in, thank you, purple.
[05:58.74]Hey, Crazy Carl, thanks for the sub.
[05:59.96]And Breenland, thanks for the resub too.
[06:03.48]If I remember how to play these games, you like dodge left and right.
[06:06.61]And then you can just punch them in the face like 15 times, right?
[06:11.57]Will he do anything?
[06:13.71]Well, I guess... This is the regular Nintendo version, right?
[06:16.81]So maybe they're all just idiots.
[06:18.37]Yeah.
[06:22.29]There we go.
[06:23.05]I remember now.
[06:25.13]How hard is this game?
[06:27.15]While we wait for the actual Wii one where I can box on camera.
[06:33.76]Whew.
[06:34.06]I'm kicking this guy's ass.
[06:40.82]Is there anything about accurate height?
[06:45.77]I always switch hands in these games.
[06:49.83]It's in the rule?
[06:50.57]It's in the rule book?
[06:51.43]No, it isn't.
[06:53.74]What's a super punch?
[06:56.12]Start?
[06:57.40]Oh, that's what happens.
[06:59.10]Guys, I just got hit on Glass Joe.
[07:02.09]I might as well just quit forever.
[07:12.59]$50,000?
[07:12.73]Holy shit.
[07:15.06]Hold on a second, Glass Joe.
[07:16.06]I gotta knock you out so I can see.
[07:17.12]Somebody just gave like a ton of... You know, just punch him.
[07:18.94]Who cares?
[07:21.38]Gonna be hard in three, guys.
[07:22.60]I know, I'm saying this now.
[07:24.48]I only needed 4700 bits for the shiny red $100 icon, but you... What?
[07:31.78]Thank you, the AmeriMan.
[07:33.62]For the 50 fucking bucks.
[07:34.68]I want my $100 joke.
[07:37.59]I don't know.
[07:38.05]What can I do for a $100 joke right now?
[07:44.63]Do a no damage run?
[07:47.01]You'll get your $100 joke soon, don't worry.
[07:51.05]I died to the cleric beast.
[07:52.99]Alright, that was for you.
[07:55.89]That was for you.
[07:56.43]You see that?
[07:56.88]Look at that funny little dance I just did.
[07:58.92]It's not me.
[07:59.54]I don't know why I'm saying me.
[08:00.82]That's not me.
[08:03.70]Stay down.
[08:04.22]You're like the easiest fucking guy in the game.
[08:05.59]Don't even let him attack.
[08:08.73]Just fucking punch the shit out of him.
[08:16.95]Can't you block too?
[08:18.05]Or is that only in the other games?
[08:19.05]Isn't it if you hold up or if you don't press anything at all?
[08:24.53]Here comes the clown car joke.
[08:27.11]It's gonna happen.
[08:28.91]Stay the fuck down!
[08:30.81]Stay down!
[08:34.76]Probably should have waited to do that.
[08:40.18]What is the speedrun on this game?
[08:44.40]Was this game 60 bucks back in the day?
[08:46.16]I...
[08:47.83]Don't know.
[08:50.52]Probably not.
[08:55.14]I don't think, were games ever back like 20, 30 years ago?
[08:58.34]60 bucks?
[09:05.00]Oh, yeah, that star.
[09:06.18]That star, guys.
[09:08.45]He's like a big mustache.
[09:17.17]I already failed the speedrun.
[09:20.03]The last show is 30 seconds.
[09:26.27]Oh, he does his little... Alright, can you block this guy?
[09:31.09]No, blocking is not in this game.
[09:33.70]At least in the original one.
[09:34.58]Remember, this is like the pre-stream.
[09:45.27]We're waiting for the actual one for the Wii to download.
[09:48.65]Should be like another 10 minutes, maybe.
[09:50.93]We're going with a permadeath run.
[10:00.18]Press down?
[10:00.70]It's down.
[10:02.84]Okay, I'll try that next time.
[10:08.06]Let me see.
[10:08.70]Down.
[10:09.02]Yeah, it is down.
[10:10.10]Well, you can't block those.
[10:15.18]I thought you could punch him in the stomach, too.
[10:21.45]If this is the pre-stream, then the real stream is gonna be real fucking late.
[10:24.87]Yeah, it is.
[10:25.35]It's probably gonna pop up on the screen.
[10:29.25]It's gonna be like, hey!
[10:30.79]Your game is ready to play.
[10:34.22]Come on, guys.
[10:34.64]Don't belittle him.
[10:35.54]Yeah, don't belittle me.
[10:39.18]But hopefully you guys had a good holiday.
[10:43.45]I actually have a pran, uh, I actually have a pran for Thursday's stream.
[10:50.24]Hey guys, just now I got a pran for Thursday.
[10:56.32]Yeah, I got something that I want to do on Thursday.
[10:58.28]Let's see if it works.
[11:04.02]How many actual bosses are in this game?
[11:05.55]How many, like, people do I have to fight?
[11:06.85]Yeah.
[11:13.21]Alright, let's do it.
[11:15.97]Punch Out is a weird game, because didn't they just kind of remake the game three times?
[11:21.94]Like, don't you play against these same exact people over the course of the next four games?
[11:27.16]There's Punch Out, there's Super Punch Out, and then there was, like, New Punch Out, and then there was, like, Wii Punch Out, right?
[11:32.93]Oh, shit.
[11:36.43]Four of five, five. ...
[11:48.27]Look at these dodges.
[11:49.67]Well, more than that.
[11:50.27]I thought it was only five.
[11:52.73]I just like... Uh-oh.
[11:54.12]Oh, shit.
[11:54.44]Wait, wait, wait.
[11:55.38]You block, right?
[12:01.02]Yep.
[12:02.38]I got it.
[12:09.31]Kind of, they added a lot of super and added one in the Wii version.
[12:12.17]They refined it a lot.
[12:13.77]I'm gonna get my ass kicked in the Wii version.
[12:15.35]I already know it.
[12:21.94]Come on, let me TKO this guy.
[12:23.36]Come on.
[12:32.73]It's Mike Tyson's punch-out, but isn't this now Mr. Dream?
[12:36.49]Mike Tyson presents Mr. Dream.
[12:45.27]Sweaty stream incoming?
[12:46.33]Yeah, probably.
[12:49.65]Wait, what?
[12:53.72]I remember being so, so bad at this game when I was a kid.
[13:01.81]I was just rage-induced when I would play this game.
[13:05.57]Because I just didn't get it.
[13:09.12]Little, like, five foot tall me.
[13:11.40]That's how tall I was.
[13:13.78]I'm much taller than that now.
[13:14.82]But little, like, four foot tall me.
[13:19.49]Just didn't comprehend the idea of dodging and then punching.
[13:23.03]I was just like, here's how, like, four and a half foot tall me used to play this game.
[13:28.13]Ready?
[13:35.31]I don't get it.
[13:35.87]Why can I not hurt him?
[13:37.59]I should be able to hurt him.
[13:41.01]Then I would lose to stuff like that.
[13:53.69]Come on!
[13:58.35]Can I get a permanent ban?
[13:59.51]Why would you want a permanent ban?
[14:03.88]Lie back down, aww.
[14:11.66]Oof.
[14:16.29]That's two in a row!
[14:20.83]What?!
[14:21.69]Immediately, right in the fucking stomach.
[14:23.17]Right in the sternum.
[14:23.79]Immediately!
[14:25.81]Okay, well, I got him.
[14:29.11]Remember when the old Jerma was way taller and funnier than this new Jerma?
[14:31.72]Yeah, I do too.
[14:38.36]But thank you, Major, for the thousand bits.
[14:41.52]Speaking of people, Blue Milk dealer, thanks for three months.
[14:44.07]Suicidal Spree, four months.
[14:46.05]Waffle Stacks for seven months.
[14:49.37]Uh, Sporacle, thank you.
[14:54.63]Mad Oak Rasta, thanks for the sub as well.
[14:57.92]Lazerlic for four months.
[14:59.82]Weird Bananas for three months.
[15:01.10]Swellfoop, thanks for the new sub.
[15:03.84]Oh, no, for two months, actually.
[15:07.02]Oh, he has that, uh... I just realized in the Smash Bros.
[15:12.28]video game, he, like, has that outfit, doesn't he?
[15:16.83]Passkey.
[15:17.43]Somebody write that down.
[15:18.81]Somebody write that down.
[15:19.53]Because I don't want to remember it.
[15:25.19]Oh, look!
[15:25.45]That's me!
[15:27.61]See, I'm like 23.
[15:28.08]Let's go.
[15:28.58]Alright, this is where I'm going to get my... I'm going to lose.
[15:41.77]I'm done.
[15:47.96]At this point, I forget.
[15:49.08]Everybody knows the first three punch-out enemies.
[15:54.64]And then after that, you just don't remember anything.
[15:59.21]I guess you have to bait this guy out.
[16:03.33]I guess... Okay, that's how you beat that guy.
[16:16.78]That guy's fucking easy.
[16:17.66]Oh, fuck.
[16:20.10]I was trying to catch him.
[16:27.17]Hard game.
[16:27.89]Imagine getting punched in the face that many times in a row.
[16:37.12]Well, I blocked it.
[16:38.36]I dodged it.
[16:38.80]That's bullshit.
[16:47.37]Acid bass?
[16:48.73]No, no acid bass.
[16:52.13]Mr. Sub, I'm gonna read him in a minute, don't worry.
[16:54.38]I'll catch you, I swear.
[16:55.70]I promise.
[16:59.68]We're in that weird thing where I'm playing the Nintendo Wii and I can't hear notifications.
[17:03.50]So, I'm sorry.
[17:04.96]Alright, we're going against the frog.
[17:12.72]After the frog fight, I'll read the new sub that came in a few minutes ago.
[17:19.33]You punch this guy in the stomach, right?
[17:26.55]Oh, whoops.
[17:28.71]Yeah, it's in the stomach.
[17:30.00]You gotta hit him right in his belly button.
[17:32.60]Yeah, oh, his pants come down.
[17:34.02]I feel like forget.
[17:34.82]What's going on with my guy?
[17:42.42]Oh, fuck, I forget.
[17:43.24]You're like, his pants come down and you punch him in the stomach or punch him in the face?
[17:49.93]I'm out of stamina.
[17:58.84]Oh, okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[18:00.06]You gotta get him, like... What?
[18:05.18]Motherfuck!
[18:09.18]Don't you just have to, like, hit it?
[18:10.36]Don't his fucking pants just come down?
[18:11.70]Oh, shit, I have to press buttons.
[18:21.80]Oh shit, I'm playing like fucking four-year-old me.
[18:27.32]There we go.
[18:28.28]Ah, it's right when he opens his mouth, I remember now.
[18:40.77]Join the Nintendo Fun Club today.
[18:47.51]I feel like eating after I win.
[18:49.05]Let's go to lunch.
[18:51.56]Okay.
[18:55.02]Get some dialog here.
[19:01.74]Fuck.
[19:02.65]Try to press up.
[19:09.23]Ah!
[19:11.39]Get off.
[19:25.22]I can't wait to use the actual boxing gloves.
[19:26.76]It's gonna be fun.
[19:35.59]Fuck, I'm trying to press up.
[19:37.23]This little brinky-dink shithole dumbass.
[19:40.88]I could complain right now, but I'm not going to.
[19:43.70]You know, I am gonna complain.
[19:45.18]My thumb is bigger than the entire Wiimote's gamepad.
[19:49.72]The Wiimote's gamepad, if I put my thumb on it, my whole fucking thumb is the size of this thing.
[19:54.69]When I press left, sometimes it just presses up, too.
[19:56.63]Need to get the fucking classic controller plugged in, I guess.
[20:08.64]Who doesn't love Little Mac?
[20:14.38]Big hands and short.
[20:18.66]Oh, I forget what this guy does.
[20:19.68]I think you just have to outbox this guy.
[20:26.61]Fast draw stream today?
[20:27.99]No.
[20:29.51]We're not playing that game again.
[20:37.43]Ow.
[20:37.57]Ow, I forget.
[20:38.03]I'll just wait.
[20:41.51]Alright, I can only punch him once.
[20:43.23]I get it.
[20:54.54]Two, three, four.
[20:56.46]Four.
[20:56.96]One, two, three, four.
[20:59.94]One, two, three, four.
[21:03.55]He ain't that bad.
[21:05.31]He's going to do a one-hit KO move that I forget about.
[21:07.21]You know what I'm saying.
[21:13.93]Charge your punch.
[21:17.79]I'm too scared to do that right now.
[21:28.12]Dude, no death run?
[21:28.91]What do you think?
[21:30.21]No.
[21:31.55]I'm gonna get to like the next circuit in the list.
[21:37.11]Oh shit.
[21:38.39]Ah!
[21:38.79]Oh!
[21:41.85]What do I do?
[21:46.25]I forgot that whole thing.
[21:48.01]I don't even remember.
[21:48.66]I have no idea.
[22:01.01]Keep your guard up.
[22:01.83]I have purred long enough.
[22:03.55]Now hear me roar.
[22:08.23]I'm going to beat him.
[22:08.79]Don't worry.
[22:20.41]God damn it!
[22:20.83]Alright, don't do that move again because I can't fucking figure it out.
[22:32.44]Usually when I don't know how to do that, I just try to super punch and just pray that I- Oh, fuck, hold on, I gotta stop talking.
[22:38.30]What's wrong with me?
[22:39.24]It's tough, like, panting.
[22:42.70]Block?
[22:43.10]There's no time to block, you can't.
[22:51.12]Shit.
[22:51.90]Okay, I'm just gonna block.
[22:56.06]Oh.
[22:57.18]Oh, whoa!
[22:58.56]Oh, you're just gonna block the whole thing.
[23:21.61]Come get me.
[23:27.55]What?
[23:27.77]Punch him?
[23:29.17]Oh, let me dodge to the left because my thumb is too big for the controller.
[23:32.17]Give me a break.
[23:39.89]He would have been dead right there.
[23:52.29]Pretty great dodge.
[24:05.13]Punch him in the stomach when he crouches down.
[24:06.67]I could go for it.
[24:16.10]Whoa!
[24:16.72]God!
[24:17.16]Alright, I'm about to fucking... I'm about to just go to the wee one.
[24:23.77]There's only so many times I can have my whole hand press every direction before I get angry.
[24:37.05]I'm gonna clean this town up.
[24:38.69]Fuck, he's gonna knock me down, isn't he?
[24:55.66]Come on, don't do it.
[24:57.52]Don't do it!
[24:58.95]Oh, whatever.
[25:03.29]He's dead.
[25:07.93]Hey, Eamon.
[25:11.98]Thank you, learn to spell for eight months.

[26:10.21]According to George Lucas, it's not canon.
[26:13.07]George Lucas came forward and said,
[26:14.86]But the Gloom Man origin story is not necessarily canon.
[26:19.42]And everyone was like, oh, thank you, George Lucas.

[28:51.15]Alright, what was that?
[29:03.23]God damn it!
[29:06.15]Okay, was I talking to myself or was I like yelling at my dog who was shitting on the rug?

[30:17.81]Actually, I have to pee.
[30:20.07]So let me pee first.
[30:20.97]I didn't pee before I turned the stream on because I'm a fucking idiot.
[30:24.54]TV only.
[30:25.44]I'm going to plug in our... I'm going to play this one.

[30:44.33]Be right back.
[31:49.97]Hey kid, they say boxing is fighting, backed by technique.
[31:53.33]Now listen up, I'm gonna teach you everything you need to know.
[31:57.39]Punch by moving the Wii remote or nunchuck forward.
[32:03.77]Block certain attacks by holding up on the control stick.
[32:08.37]To throw a high punch, hold up on the control stick and then throw your punch.
[32:16.69]When you have a star, you can throw your star punch.
[32:21.38]What is going on right now?
[32:24.55]What the fuck is going on?
[32:28.55]Oh, hi guys.
[32:40.40]Remember me?
[32:43.14]I'm that guy that plays games in front of a fucking camera.
[32:55.57]Alright.
[32:56.29]Somebody gave two hundred- two thousand seventeen bits.
[32:59.47]Wait, did I fly down?
[33:00.41]I thought my, like, fly was down.
[33:03.57]That would've been fuckin' embarrassing.
[33:05.91]Wait, it might be.
[33:08.63]No, it's not.
[33:09.15]Okay.
[33:09.37]This is fuckin' loud.
[33:12.64]Hold on.

[33:28.56]Of course I'm going to sit down.
[33:35.65]There, that's better.
[33:37.41]That's going to be better.
[33:41.33]I'm getting attacked by bees.
[33:45.45]I'm getting swarmed by bees.
[33:48.73]Hold on.
[33:55.12]Alright, this is how you play, right?
[33:56.68]This is how you play this game?
[33:59.97]Have I- I've played this our last pla- I've- wait, wait, hold on a second.
[34:09.25]I already have this game?
[34:12.81]Does that mean I bought it for no reason?
[34:15.35]Is it in like a box somewhere?
[34:19.69]Alright, well apparently like fucking three years ago I played this game.
[34:27.09]We started from the beginning.
[34:29.76]Oh, fuck.
[34:33.17]Alright.
[34:33.51]We promote it, nunchuck!
[34:43.42]Alright, controls... I don't get it.

[34:54.96]I don't care.
[34:56.43]We'll figure... We balance, boy.
[34:57.83]I don't have one of those.
[34:58.65]Tutorial.
[35:02.33]I know how to play the game already.
[35:03.85]I know, like, what I'm doing.

[35:38.00]And he's 5'10, 110 pounds though, that's not, that's not me.
[35:43.34]It's still too loud for my tastes.
[35:51.13]That's better.
[35:57.19]I deliberately picked the darker shirt that I own so you could see my nipples.
[36:05.20]This is a fucking Millennium Falcon shirt, dude.
[36:07.38]What are you talking about?
[36:09.22]Look it.

[38:22.85]Shut up.

[50:23.75]As long as... when you're here, you're having fun, that's all I care about, dude.
[50:27.43]You don't have to... worry about missing streams, just... Thanks for just being here, dude, and thanks for the fucking 5,000 bits, that's extremely generous.
[50:36.80]You are under no obligation to be here.
[50:43.58]Oh shit, question marks?
[50:45.23]That's how you know the guy's fucked.
[50:50.00]Alright, this is the guy whose pants come down.
[50:51.38]Yeah, this is the pants guy.
[50:54.35]Gonna punch him in his mouth when he opens it.
[50:55.67]I already know the secrets.
[50:56.49]I've already played this game.
[50:57.61]You guys know that, right?
[51:03.71]Jerk streamer?
[51:15.71]He missed a donation?
[51:19.21]I wish I could hear it.
[51:19.95]I wish there was a way I could set this up so I could actually get notifications.
[51:33.24]Ooh!
[51:37.64]This game's fun.
[51:41.43]I'm having, like, fun right now.
[51:43.43]And I'm getting exercise!
[51:45.31]The Nintendo Wii!
[51:53.14]That's a lot of health.
[52:02.63]Shit.
[52:02.97]Okay, when he like, when he pulls his pants up.
[52:08.81]He's like a little shimmy and that's when you can get the star power.
[52:14.68]Oh, didn't think I knew how to fucking dodge that one, did you?
[52:55.58]See, I know how to do it.
[53:09.02]Don't worry.
[53:09.64]Alright, let's see.
[53:16.39]Red Ranger, thanks for the 50 bucks like we talked about.
[53:21.34]I didn't miss anybody else.
[53:26.28]Red Ranger gave that fucking 100.
[53:30.01]Jesus.
[53:34.55]Red Ranger with the fucking 150, like, million dollars.
[53:39.71]Thanks a lot, man.
[53:43.69]I win.
[53:47.68]Stream sponsored by Froot.
[53:50.63]It's already getting hot in this room, too.
[53:51.97]This, like, sucks.
[53:54.39]I'm already, like, heating the fuck up.
[54:00.27]Do I need to, like, do any actual training in this game, or is just everything automatic?
[54:09.39]You sure I didn't practice this game before the stream?
[54:11.43]No, because it wasn't on the Wii menu.
[54:14.39]I had to download it.
[54:15.31]Yeah, you know what?
[54:15.81]I practiced this game, like, three years ago when I bought it.
[54:21.07]Take off your shirt.
[54:24.11]Oh, alright, fine.
[54:29.12]No.
[54:32.34]Alright.
[54:33.80]Let's go, piston.
[54:41.01]Downloaded it, practiced it, uninstalled it.
[54:44.43]No.
[54:58.18]Do I look taller?
[54:59.07]You know, I may look a little taller.
[55:02.93]Social undressing.
[55:05.73]I wasn't ready for that.
[55:07.05]Oh, okay.
[55:21.46]Probably should hold on to those.
[55:31.91]But if you do get hit, you'd fucking lose them.
[55:33.41]That sucks.
[55:38.43]What do I do?
[55:43.27]That was a lot different than the other one.
[55:48.07]I think I can hit him when he goes for that first punch.
[55:50.25]When he comes into that first one, I think I can just block him right in the face.
[55:54.12]I think so, at least.
[55:54.98]Apparently, someone worked at the GameStop where you bought this game.
[56:03.80]Yeah, that was three years ago.
[56:07.11]That's so funny that the person was just like, why did he download this fucking game?
[56:09.95]I like saw him buy it.
[56:19.32]Here we go.
[56:19.56]Right in the face.
[56:20.34]Right in the face.
[56:21.08]Right in the face.
[56:26.20]How do I get up?
[56:33.41]I'm knocking.
[56:48.20]Then we shake it.
[56:49.40]Then we shake it.
[56:50.14]He's got a real fat lip right now.
[57:18.12]And I'm like thirsty too.
[57:26.34]Don't.
[57:45.11]Shaking the controller makes him stay down longer.
[57:55.40]Alright, shake it.
[58:03.42]I love how me just moving around going gives me more health.
[58:16.19]Hey, the Nintendo Wii, even your grandmother could play it.
[58:21.64]Give the controller to grandma when the guy's on the ground.
[58:24.48]She'll really shake him up.
[58:28.30]She'll get you that extra health back, son.
[58:42.48]Only three?
[58:42.96]That's bullshit.
[58:57.59]Gotta get real sick of doing this in about fucking 10 minutes.
[59:00.71]He's out.

[72:37.08]Listen, son.
[72:37.98]Great Tiger's uppercuts are tricky.
[72:40.12]You've got to be careful the way you dodge.
[72:46.19]Impressive with your punch-out skills.
[72:47.59]That's what I'm trying to do.
[72:49.21]It's not working.
[72:57.29]Stop dodging that way, please.
[73:00.33]Oh.
[73:07.54]What is he saying?

[76:34.68]Renegade Coaster, thanks for the $5.
[76:35.98]Jerma, whatever this is, just know we're all happy.
[76:41.31]Thanks a lot, guys.
[76:43.33]Take my shirt off.
[76:44.35]Take this shirt off.
[76:52.04]What the fuck?
[76:58.30]6-1, 152.
[76:58.60]I remember this guy.
[77:03.36]This is the easy guy, right?
[77:04.24]You just punch him once and then he dies in like two seconds.
[77:18.07]No, I can't.
[77:18.73]If I take my shirt off, I'm going to get banned from twitch.tv.
[77:21.45]Don't you know how that works?
[77:24.07]If this shirt comes off, I'm banned.
[77:27.25]There are Twitch staff that come in here from time to time, and they'll be like, this guy doesn't have any fucking clothes on.
[77:31.43]He's gone.
[77:31.86]Agh, it's not a different guy.
[77:36.72]Agh!
[77:47.75]God!
[77:49.81]Oh, he's kicking my ass.
[77:53.25]It's a little... I gotta get the... Alright, the delay is what you gotta get.
[78:03.85]Alright, well, I gotta learn how this guy works.
[78:08.15]Damn it, that's fast.
[78:19.55]Now what does he say?
[78:21.41]What does that mean?
[78:22.05]Two, three.
[78:22.51]Yeah, I was trying to punch him in the face when he said three.
[78:55.84]I'll get banter and move my... Well, in certain... Hold on.
[78:59.14]Wait, wait, wait.
[79:06.52]That didn't even fucking hit me.
[79:10.37]Punch of love.
[79:16.89]Ah.
[79:18.97]I really need to start to spin over once I... I got the first half of it down...
[79:26.19]He's saying subscribe to Jerva.
[79:28.29]I just got like a gameplay tip right there and I just ignored it.
[79:40.58]Oh, he's gonna hit me with that every time.
[79:53.74]Gotta go with the left hand first on that one.
[79:57.17]Yeah.
[79:57.87]Alright.
[79:58.59]Taking the three.
[79:59.25]Here we go.
[79:59.87]Cool.
[80:01.71]Got it.
[80:03.23]Ah!
[80:27.39]at my hand!
[80:32.07]Just punch before he uppercuts?
[80:35.25]That's too much of a weird brain to handle at the moment.
[80:37.05]Whoa!
[80:37.75]That's new.
[80:50.13]What's happening?
[80:50.63]Did I just punch off his mustache?
[80:56.50]But I don't hurt him.
[81:02.01]I fucking lost that dude, that sucked.
[81:04.57]So now that he's like angry, I can't, no.
[81:09.67]Oh, who did I punch in the stomach?
[81:11.49]Oh!
[81:24.42]his toupee falls off so then he takes like extra he gets extra mad punch the highlights out of his hair
[81:53.72]He's in phase two right now.
[81:57.22]What am I... I fucking... I swear to goodness.
[82:24.13]Oh!
[82:37.10]I don't like his timing.
[82:37.72]His timing's weird.
[82:38.42]Sometimes he punches with that left hand and it freaks me out.
[82:40.94]If you ever grow a beard, I can't.
[82:45.08]Every time I grow a beard, after like five or six days, it just turns into, uh, awfulness.
[82:50.75]Like, yeah, I gotta shave it.
[82:51.85]I actually have to shave, like, tonight before I go to bed.
[82:54.51]Ah!
[83:08.76]These fucking delays.
[83:25.67]Livestream shaving?
[83:27.96]No.
[83:29.06]That would be, like, weird.
[83:31.62]I would never be able to do something like that.
[83:33.58]Like, just stand there with, like, a camera on me, just like... Yeah, it looks good.
[83:40.77]No.
[83:41.47]I actually don't like how I look with a completely clean shaved face.
[83:46.29]I think it's like I look too much like a little baby.
[83:49.85]I like a little bit, but not like this.
[83:51.69]This is too much.
[83:52.33]This is way too much.
[83:56.17]I like a little bit.
[84:03.24]Social shaving?
[84:07.02]That might be kind of funny just to do.
[84:10.10]Now that I think about it, actually.
[84:18.51]Next circuit.
[84:29.63]Skyrim streamer is sad because friend doesn't like him.
[84:32.57]Well, he wanted to play Fistful of Frags.
[84:35.55]He doesn't even like that game.
[84:38.95]Last time he talked about Fistful of Frags is how the game sucked.
[84:43.63]If he really wants to play, I would play it, but... He's a real weird guy, you know?
[84:52.12]Aaron Ryan.
[84:54.44]A.K.A.
[84:55.60]Chris Jericho.
[84:59.04]This is where I start to get really badly beat.
[85:08.64]He just downloaded it today for me.
[85:13.30]We haven't even like talked about this.
[85:15.20]I have not talked to Star about that at all.
[85:18.38]He sent me like a random text just like, hey, play Fistful of Frags with me.
[85:22.44]Is that it?
[85:23.78]Is that it?
[85:24.94]Hold on.
[85:33.72]This guy is fucked.
[85:39.01]Holy shit, dude.
[85:40.87]I can only hit him once?
[85:54.77]Damn it.
[86:05.78]Am I missing something here?
[86:12.89]I have to cut him off, don't I?
[86:14.83]Okay, I gotta cut him off.
[86:16.31]Okay.
[86:17.39]I will never beat this guy.
[86:31.17]I will never beat this guy.
[86:31.91]Never.
[86:32.17]Never.
[86:37.03]I need him to have to go in right when he... I'm going to beat this guy.
[86:42.58]I'll see you tomorrow.
[86:43.54]That's when I win.
[87:06.42]I gotta restart.
[87:29.91]48 hour stream confirmed.
[87:45.88]I'm, like, actually moving around in REAL LIFE!
[88:04.07]48-hour stream.
[88:05.07]No.
[88:06.07]Come on, come on.
[88:16.11]See, like, that's new.
[88:16.73]Let's sew it.
[88:18.21]He's got a new move now.
[88:23.03]He's like a moonsault.
[88:26.05]I did what?
[88:33.53]I should have countered him, shouldn't I?
[88:39.55]I got three.
[88:41.65]Do I keep these till next round?
[88:43.00]Keep hitting me.
[88:43.96]I love it.
[88:46.44]Let's go.
[88:49.64]I hope I have those still.
[88:50.92]Probably not.
[88:58.90]What am I?
[89:05.74]Beer.
[89:09.04]One, two, three, four.
[89:11.76]Let's go.
[89:47.40]I'll be alright.
[89:48.82]He's going down.
[89:49.36]Nope.
[90:05.05]I can't get him from that side, ever.
[90:24.73]That should be it.
[90:28.39]He forgives you?
[90:29.48]Forgive me for what?
[90:32.32]Star's a great dude.
[90:33.22]I love Star.
[90:35.27]But it was kind of out of the blue that he wanted to play with his little friends.
[90:38.34]Fucking... Stop!
[91:08.19]I fucking can't do it.
[91:35.41]I just gotta knock him down one more time and I should win.
[91:49.01]This guy's fucking so hard!
[91:50.81]He's not even hard!
[91:56.63]He's seriously not even hard!
[92:01.38]Stay down, please!
[92:05.36]He's not hard.
[92:22.49]Stay down this time.
[92:28.58]Stay down, please.
[92:34.63]So hard, he's not even hard.
[92:37.93]It's actually very simple when you get the patterns.
[92:39.47]Yeah, I know.
[92:44.15]Don't get up.
[92:44.71]Thank God.
[92:53.92]1-800-MATH.
[92:54.32]You got a great name.
[92:55.10]You battle through the pain.
[93:00.77]That's the way.
[93:03.23]No, I'm playing Punch Out.
[93:04.23]I want to beat Punch Out.
[93:11.54]Oh, this is Soda Popinski.
[93:16.14]Wasn't he like the last guy in the second game?
[93:19.78]I remember him being like one of the harder bosses.
[93:22.56]I say bosses all the time, but he's not a boss.
[93:30.15]Oh, I'm going to get my ass kicked.
[93:35.41]Hey, Reetbot, thanks for 12 months.
[93:38.25]Let trumpet Ster.
[93:41.50]Ster for 11 months, thank you, Star.
[93:43.20]Star, so just want you to know I didn't mean that shit I said.
[93:45.54]I went too far.
[93:46.52]I hope you're okay.
[93:49.64]Are you, like, still streaming?
[93:50.88]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[93:52.87]Star, are you streaming right now?
[93:54.13]What are you doing?
[94:04.10]Is Star in the chat, too?
[94:05.50]I don't even know.
[94:09.08]But thank you, Star, for 11 months.
[94:16.55]No, no, no.
[94:18.53]Well, I want to see... One more, like... Once I get mad one more time, then maybe I'll play Fistful of Frags.
[94:26.61]He's not.
[94:26.99]Well, then... Look, I didn't buy this game twice just to quit, like, 50% of the way through.
[94:36.96]Come on, guys.
[94:37.82]I need to restart because this guy is very, very fast.
[94:47.28]Let's do it.
[94:53.95]Four.
[95:05.65]I'm gonna go only by audio cues on this guy.
[95:10.23]Alright, what's your, like, phase two where you drink, like, a bottle of booze and you fucking start swinging like... My face is, like, itchy.
[95:32.37]I gotta shave my face.
[95:39.28]What was that?
[95:39.98]Was I not healing right there?
[95:41.48]Huh?
[95:42.34]Whoa, that's not fair.
[95:43.73]Whoa!
[95:44.15]Didn't know what that was.
[96:03.64]Why am I not getting healed?
[96:05.38]Shit.
[96:05.64]What?
[96:33.58]Punch the bottle out of his hand?
[96:34.52]Can he do that?
[96:34.94]Small sweaty streamer.
[96:37.20]I'm only... It's just hot in here because this light.
[96:38.54]This light is beaming down on me.
[97:04.19]God, immediately.
[97:04.99]Now heal!
[97:08.97]Listen to Doc.
[97:10.67]I know, I'm gonna punch it out of his hand.
[97:17.16]Jeez, man.
[97:27.05]Punch it!
[97:29.91]No, don't point at it!
[97:33.99]Ah, I was like pointing at it.
[97:45.02]I gotta get his, it's all about patterns, man.
[97:53.07]Just gotta get the patterns down.
[98:19.57]Concentrating, concentrating.
[98:25.43]I did the high punch to get the soda.
[98:26.89]I was just... You know, doing this.
[98:46.78]Come on.
[98:51.56]That's it.
[98:52.04]I win.
[98:59.28]Thank you for all the subs, guys.
[99:00.18]I'm sorry I'm missing so many of them.
[99:03.18]It's just like I said before.
[99:05.91]I don't have any audio cues that anything happened so like 20 minutes go by I'm like oh shit I feel like I'm sitting like far away from the screen so I have to like go lean in and look at the other monitor All I can hear right now is the game volume.
[99:18.50]I'm sorry But I do appreciate it very much so Am I like at the end of the game?
[99:26.65]Is the game almost over?
[99:37.07]Same deal with this guy.
[99:38.37]Don't lose to him.
[99:46.65]He's playing Game Boy?
[99:47.65]No, this is the Wii version of this game.
[100:07.36]Oh, alright.
[100:10.15]Two.
[100:17.31]Hey.
[100:17.85]That, that's new.
[100:18.95]Oh, it hurts!
[100:23.45]Ah, just restart, restart, restart.
[100:36.07]The spinning around is what's fucking me up.
[100:45.19]I thought it was... It's so hard to tell if he's gonna do that or the spin.
[101:02.02]Or just the fucking coming in right at you immediately.
[101:08.18]The game's just Dark Souls.
[101:10.22]Just realized that.
[101:14.05]Gotta memorize everything they do and then kill them.
[101:16.95]Alright.
[101:35.59]How many of these dudes are in the Classic Punch-Out?
[101:38.57]I think all of them, except maybe one or two.
[101:41.81]Duck.
[101:42.79]Duck, right?
[101:51.16]You gotta punch him right in the stomach for that, but I had no idea what that timing was.
[102:18.84]I got that down, I think, pretty well.
[102:21.33]I say that, and I just fucking jigs the shit out of myself.
[102:38.94]What's the, is the clown in this game?
[102:40.38]Wasn't there, like, a huge clown?
[102:49.97]Now what's he gonna say?
[102:52.23]Okay.
[102:52.35]Careful!
[102:52.51]Careful!
[103:28.29]He just threw a dumbbell into the crowd.
[103:37.38]He's gonna kill somebody.
[103:38.92]Damn it.
[103:54.30]Do you want me to say bye to Kim?
[104:01.94]Is she leaving?
[104:04.10]Bye, Kim.
[104:05.44]If you are leaving.
[104:07.70]Thanks for sticking around.
[104:08.58]Thanks for subbing.
[104:10.18]I did not expect you to sub to this channel.
[104:16.24]Fuck!
[104:18.17]I can't play the game.
[104:27.63]I'm gonna lose.
[104:28.83]I'm dead.
[104:30.13]Let's hope.
[104:38.84]Hopefully that wasn't just somebody making that up.
[104:45.54]I gotta get it.
[104:46.12]3, 2, 1, go.
[104:48.63]Got it!
[104:52.03]That was for you, Kim.
[104:53.49]That was for you, Kim.
[104:54.37]I did that for you.
[104:56.43]I beat the bad guy for you.
[105:01.75]Just get him knocked down, please.
[105:25.21]Yeah, that was Kim.
[105:28.09]She's cool.
[105:29.43]She's very cool.
[105:57.40]That's it, right?
[105:58.70]She's still alive.
[106:05.29]Kim said to call her?
[106:07.27]Well, I call her on stream?
[106:12.71]She's still here.
[106:15.96]I did it!
[106:17.74]I did it!
[106:19.86]It only took, like, two gallons of sweat to come off my body.
[106:25.46]You can always take a whoopin'.
[106:30.68]No pain, no gain, Mac, baby.
[106:33.00]You took a beating and you still came out on top.
[106:37.72]Oh, God.
[106:38.24]No.
[106:49.33]I am not going to call her on stream.
[106:53.37]That would be like... Call her on Skype?
[106:58.76]No, it wouldn't be on Skype.
[107:09.43]Super Macho Man.
[107:18.87]I wish I could see if she was writing anything.
[107:21.33]It just goes too fast.
[107:22.41]I'm just like, where?
[107:23.77]I can't see.
[107:31.02]Super Macho Man.
[107:38.75]Is this seat as low as I can go?
[107:40.31]I'm so sorry, that probably hurt your ears.
[107:49.62]Change to king mode.
[107:53.26]I can't even like see right now, I don't know why.
[107:55.44]Hold on, this like light just like started to cause problems with my vision.
[108:03.20]She said I can't call her.

[108:52.36]Whoa!
[108:53.38]Whoa!
[108:55.06]That just was almost a fucking disaster!
[108:57.10]I went to grab my phone, and it, like, I almost knocked the whole light over.
[109:09.81]I'm gonna see if you guys are fucking lying to me.
[109:25.00]I'm writing... I'm writing, you wanna say something to these psychos?
[109:34.42]Don't do it, don't do it.
[109:35.56]It's just a joke.

[110:02.93]You, send me a text if you want, like if you'd want to do that.
[110:07.94]You absolutely do not have to do that shit at all.
[110:10.93]Don't listen to these guys.
[110:12.31]Don't listen to these guys.
[110:13.37]These guys are a bunch of fucking crazy people.
[110:16.07]Don't listen to these people.
[110:21.82]Oh god.
[110:27.08]Oh god.
[110:36.25]Hello?
[110:39.33]Hello?
[110:45.29]Hi.
[110:46.45]I'm in my basement.
[110:47.55]I don't think people will be able to hear you very well.
[110:52.69]You want me to put your own speaker and you can say hello?
[110:56.15]Yeah, I'm downstairs in the middle of nowhere.
[111:06.59]Yeah, I lost the connection.
[111:08.33]I lost the connection.
[111:09.37]I'm down in my basement.
[111:10.57]I live in the middle of nowhere.
[111:11.55]Service is terrible.
[111:17.09]I love how she's like... I think she's deliberately fucking with me right now.
[111:21.54]That's kind of fun.
[111:22.92]That's kind of fun.
[111:28.86]I did lose the connection.
[111:31.10]I swear to God.
[111:32.20]I...
[111:39.76]Hold on a second.
[111:40.98]I gotta put that with the sensor bar.
[111:46.07]Jesus.
[111:51.89]Am I ever gonna beat this guy?
[111:59.91]I can't even.
[112:00.66]I can't even fucking play.
[112:02.06]I'm getting like prank called.
[112:03.38]I'm getting like prank calls and shit.
[112:17.13]Alright, let's get back to the game.
[112:29.34]It's all going downhill.
[112:37.39]Didn't call her back.
[112:38.27]No, it's because if I call from down here, I'm going to be totally real.
[112:42.30]This is going to be real talk.
[112:44.56]I won't make a connection at all.
[112:47.20]I'm actually surprised that she actually got through.
[112:50.40]Very surprised.
[112:52.16]Considering I'm locked down here in my basement.
[112:55.90]I'm actually kicking this guy's ass now.
[113:18.87]Come on, I dodged it.
[113:20.23]Didn't dodge that one.
[113:22.15]Come on.
[113:22.65]Now we're starting again.
[113:24.53]Starting again.
[113:25.27]Okay.
[113:34.37]You can't get calls, but I have fast enough internet to stream.
[113:37.31]Well, my town does not have a cell tower.
[113:41.61]It has internet.
[113:43.25]The internet's fine.
[113:45.49]But there is no cell tower in this entire town.
[113:48.09]Because don't ask me fucking why, I have no idea.
[113:55.82]They piggyback off of the next town for some reason.
[114:00.62]Right when I get a star, too.
[114:08.04]Use Wi-Fi calling?
[114:10.13]Do I even have that?
[114:11.17]I'm not even sure I have that.
[114:16.13]Don't fuck it up.
[114:28.16]Trying to trick you guys?
[114:29.12]I'm not trying to trick you guys, I promise.
[114:33.44]Gotta duck that one.
[114:35.44]That just fucked me up so much.
[114:36.64]He threw another goddamn variable.
[114:40.21]When he puts his hand in the air, I gotta duck it.
[114:49.27]Thought he did it again.
[115:04.93]It's more audio cues than it is visual cues for me.
[115:08.57]That's new.
[115:10.35]Scream swindle stones.
[115:12.15]I wanted to like... Hold on.
[115:16.38]Might just restart.
[115:31.47]Maybe not.
[115:37.83]Chat Wingman.
[115:40.15]Yeah, don't take anything they say seriously.
[115:42.97]They're just fucking around.
[115:51.69]Interesting introduction, though.
[115:53.05]I was not expecting a... Dermot doesn't love us anymore?
[115:57.05]Are you fucking serious?
[115:57.89]Love all you guys.
[115:58.69]Come on.
[116:05.80]Who's after this guy?
[116:18.85]Give me my full health.
[116:19.91]Come on, I can beat this guy.
[116:20.87]One, two, three, four.
[116:28.79]Killed the ref.
[116:29.83]Okay, I'm good.
[116:33.31]I just got really scared that I was gonna lose.
[117:02.29]Fuck.
[117:02.61]Hey Spencer, what's going on dude?
[117:32.59]Thanks for joining, Spencer.
[117:34.14]Twitch staff.
[117:35.56]Twitch staff.
[117:42.04]Oh, by the way, Spencer, I got my wonderful Twitch hoodie in the mail today.
[117:49.52]It's cool.
[117:50.25]It's beautiful.
[117:51.11]I always wanted a Twitch hoodie for so long.
[117:53.75]For years, I was like, how do I get a Twitch hoodie?
[117:55.67]And then I got one.
[118:06.12]So thank all the guys in the office for that, that's really nice.
[118:09.84]If you could relay the message, uh, I think Mr. Slin... Can we just talk about Mr. Slin for a second?
[118:16.42]How Mr. Slin's, like, one of the greatest dudes ever?
[118:21.93]Mr. Slin is fucking awesome.
[118:25.22]Mr. Slim, if you don't know, also is Twitch staff.
[118:29.60]He streams too, I think, sometimes.
[118:31.50]He's really great.
[118:33.80]Gosh, damn it.
[118:45.82]I got the patterns down a little bit.
[118:47.64]Fuck!
[118:48.04]Fuck!
[118:58.19]Come on, go down again.
[119:02.81]One, two, three, four.
[119:08.59]One, two, three, four.
[119:26.37]Show us my 10-pack!
[119:28.06]I don't have a 10-pack.
[119:30.12]Although I am starting to work out again.
[119:31.30]I said that a thousandth- AHH!
[119:32.88]Shut up!
[119:33.20]Quick!
[119:33.44]Quiet!
[119:34.78]Everybody quiet!
[119:35.82]Uh, yeah, I um... I'm trying to do working out again.
[119:42.66]Like, for the fucking 20,000th time that I've said that.
[119:45.60]Alright, I'll beat him.
[119:46.30]Let's go.
[119:55.62]Kim is a girl who sold this game to me at GameStop.
[119:57.80]That is not true.
[119:59.84]We're playing, like, Telephone right now.
[120:02.20]I don't know where that came from.
[120:06.26]That was Telephone?
[120:08.40]Like, the original sentence was not that.
[120:31.71]Give me health, please!
[120:34.42]What do I use for a micro?
[120:35.12]I use a Newman microphone.
[120:37.48]TL002 or something?
[120:50.56]I don't know how to do it.
[120:53.24]Fucking hell.
[120:55.19]When he does the pump it, do you dodge down to the right?
[120:57.63]I feel like I get hit with it every time.
[120:59.15]Or do I just block it?
[121:08.53]You guys are going to fucking kill me.
[121:34.31]How can you capture someone when you were in his condo just the other night?
[121:37.49]Oh god.
[121:39.83]Kim dropping the fucking heat.
[121:49.50]Red alert.
[121:50.92]Oh god.
[121:51.96]What is happening?
[121:53.48]What is happening in my stream?
[121:56.57]What do I do?
[121:57.09]How do I block this?
[122:00.39]Oh god.
[122:01.15]I win.
[122:21.79]Thank you, Adio- Thank you, IDOBOY.
[122:24.35]Or IDOBOY, that's very kind of you.
[122:28.75]This is a- THIS IS A Christian STREAM!
[122:32.78]Is that a tomato streamer?
[122:34.14]I see it is.
[122:34.72]Ayayay.
[122:50.68]Sweaty streamer nervously tries to box.
[122:54.82]Mr. Sam, here we go.
[122:55.80]This is the tough shit.
[122:57.26]This is where I rage with this game.
[122:59.02]My censor bar is all fucked up.
[123:03.57]Game's not even half way over.
[123:04.61]You don't think we're going to beat this whole game?
[123:08.99]Come on.
[123:13.58]Let's go.
[123:28.23]Is this, was this supposed to be, was this Mr. Dream?
[123:33.48]He doesn't look very happy.
[123:37.93]He doesn't look, he doesn't think I'll do this.
[123:38.97]Hold on, I'm getting, hold on.
[123:42.07]Quick.
[123:48.05]Too many cords.
[123:49.33]I've said this, but when are they gonna introduce a fucking cordless human?
[123:54.17]Can I just plug this shit in the back of my neck?
[123:56.53]Because this is just wrapped up all the way around me.
[124:02.14]You hope Kim is one big prank?
[124:11.10]Get off me.
[124:19.69]Made it worse.
[124:20.81]I've somehow made it worse.
[124:39.00]Oh god, what the fuck?
[124:43.54]Oh my god.
[124:46.20]Oh fuck.
[124:48.50]I don't think you want me to fucking FaceTime on stream.
[124:52.89]I don't think you want to do that.
[124:55.95]FaceTime- You want to do a FaceTime on stream right now.
[125:06.42]I don't- I don't know if that's such a- I don't know about this.
[125:13.16]Oh my lord.
[125:14.76]It's not gonna- I don't think it's gonna connect.
[125:29.55]She fucking thinks this is hilarious.
[125:36.98]This can only end badly.
[125:38.60]I really don't think it would connect down here though.
[125:48.65]Coward.
[125:57.17]Here, I... Kim, there's something I gotta tell you about Twitch chat.
[126:00.25]There's something about Twitch chat.
[126:01.85]If you say something to Twitch chat, if you, like, mention something to Twitch chat, they ain't ever gonna fucking let it go.
[126:07.95]They ain't never gonna let it go.
[126:11.21]Twitch chat is a living, breathing entity.
[126:25.54]We'll see what she says.
[126:26.90]You sent me a text.
[126:33.31]You sent me a text.
[126:34.57]And we'll try it.
[126:35.23]I'm dead.
[126:39.72]Say my darkest secrets.
[126:41.06]Don't say those darkest secrets.
[126:42.72]She doesn't even know my darkest secrets.
[126:48.40]This guy is so... This guy is just going to bash my fucking brains in, isn't he?
[126:51.79]Yeah, he is.
[127:00.87]Everyone's getting a lifetime ban.
[127:07.98]Wait, wait, wait.
[127:09.30]Do I have to counterattack this guy too?
[127:16.72]Okay.
[127:20.99]I need to learn what this guy does.
[127:25.59]Save's coming.
[127:34.39]Holy shit.
[127:35.63]Who ever said Nintendo games weren't fucking hard?
[127:52.75]You sure about this?
[128:12.60]Oh, God.
[128:13.26]One second.
[128:43.39]Bad idea, bad idea, bad idea, everyone chanting bad idea.
[128:53.14]Spencer's like, oh fuck.
[129:06.27]What if she says something like, fucked up or something.
[129:11.85]You want some ball?
[129:15.64]By the way, this is my phone.
[129:17.54]This is not a Wiimote.
[129:18.56]I don't know why I thought it was.
[129:21.22]I'm sitting here like, oh yeah, I'm gonna play with the Wiimote.
[129:26.37]Use my YouTuber reaction skills.
[129:41.25]This is a hard Dark Souls boss.
[129:44.99]She's encouraging.
[129:47.14]Can I punch him once?
[130:11.06]Alright, I'll try without the nunchuck.
[130:14.60]We'll put the nunchuck down.
[130:17.98]This dude is fucking intense.
[130:22.03]Little Mac doesn't back down from anybody.
[130:24.65]Rematch, let's go.
[130:38.03]This is actually easier.
[130:38.99]Holy shit, this is way easier.
[130:55.57]Still trying to play Punch Out, what a champ.
[131:04.69]So fast.
[131:09.40]caller as a reward.
[131:10.46]I'll try.
[131:10.98]Ah, that stand still drives me nuts.
[131:27.03]Oh my god!
[131:34.37]Switch to IRL.
[131:37.82]Well, I'm playing punch-off.
[131:45.81]There we go.
[131:49.57]Shit!
[131:51.93]There we go!
[132:16.98]This used to be a $500 cost of clown gag.
[132:22.43]Whoa, what's going on with my frame there?
[132:24.19]Frames dropping.
[132:25.13]Uh-oh.
[132:27.67]Why are my frames dropping?
[132:28.89]Okay.
[132:31.86]Jesus.
[132:44.88]Oof.
[132:54.60]Return to Comcast.
[132:55.99]It seems to be alright now.
[132:58.95]When they throw in the other variables, you just gotta... Mmm.
[133:02.47]It's gonna take me another few tries.
[133:16.01]God damn it.
[133:20.27]No, no, no, no.
[133:21.73]I need to learn the rest of his fucking moves.
[133:23.25]Oh, come on.
[133:25.21]Two fucking times in a row.
[133:39.12]God, I got him.
[133:39.64]He killed me.
[133:41.28]Ah!
[134:09.39]Oh my god.
[134:10.01]Give me the health!
[134:16.78]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!
[134:17.84]Why haven't I not modded her yet?
[134:19.26]Alright, hold on.
[134:26.75]Tried to punch.
[134:31.75]Watch.
[134:32.53]Look.
[134:36.49]You see my fucking thumb?
[134:39.38]You see how it's the size of the entire, the entire thing?
[134:44.52]If I press up, the whole thing gets pressed.
[134:47.88]I don't have one of those fancy Super Controllers.
[135:05.56]I gotta get that down.
[135:09.75]These punches are so fucking fast and then the Night Knight is like a full second and it's like an instant kill.
[135:19.40]I got fat thumbs?
[135:20.20]I don't have fat thumbs.
[135:21.82]These are normal sized thumbs.
[135:33.20]Ayayay.
[135:43.55]Shit.
[135:50.31]Oh my god, I can't do it.
[136:03.57]I tried to punch right there, but my fucking fingers are too big.
[136:25.96]No swearing in front of Kim.
[136:33.77]I'm gonna try this one more time.
[136:46.51]I thought he was going to do that twice in a row.
[137:23.79]I'm out.
[137:24.27]I'm done.
[137:29.79]I quit.
[137:30.11]I can't do it with this thing.
[137:31.37]I can't.
[137:31.63]It's not gonna happen with that thing.
[137:38.84]It's too hard to press five buttons at the same time with this little fucking horizontal brick shit controller thing.
[137:56.75]Rage Quitter?
[137:57.57]No, it's called, it's Controller Quit.
[138:00.77]It's Controller Quit.
[138:07.65]I'll play Fistful of Frags.
[138:08.87]I'll play Fistful of Frags now.
[138:10.19]But hold on, actually, this might not be good.
[138:11.83]Give me one second.
[138:16.43]I might have to restart my stream.
[138:24.36]We'll see.
[138:24.68]Hold on.
[138:35.51]Mad because bad?
[138:36.53]Oh, I never said I was good.
[138:44.92]Oh, this is actually going to be a pain in the ass.
[138:46.50]Hold on.
[138:50.34]Oh, God.
[138:50.74]That was loud.
[138:52.14]Let me...
[138:54.34]I'll be back in like five minutes.
[138:57.77]Enjoy the menu music.
[138:58.61]I'll be right back.
[141:25.34]Look at this hair.
[141:26.82]It's gotta go!
[141:30.09]Alright, um... Let's play.
[141:32.69]Star, are you in here still?
[141:33.75]Are you around, Star?
[141:34.69]You wanna play Fistful of Frags?
[141:37.05]I'll play it.
[141:37.93]Right now.
[141:40.82]I'm gonna have to restart the stream, though.
[141:56.89]You made Kim leave?
[142:00.31]Hopefully she had fun.
[142:01.46]Hopefully- Be nice, guys.
[142:05.06]Be nice.
[142:05.56]Don't be fucking crazy.
[142:11.10]We need to prove how cool we are as a fucking community.
[142:15.24]We gotta prove how fucking awesome and cool we are.
[142:20.19]Right?
[142:22.13]Right?
[142:26.54]Alright, Fistful of Frags.
[142:32.59]Disaster.
[142:34.41]No, it's not a disaster.
[142:36.73]It was unexpected, but it was nice.
[142:44.83]I was just surprised that she subscribed to the channel.
[142:47.03]I was like, whoa, that's a person that I know.
[142:54.61]Alright, give me one second.
[142:55.81]I'm going to restart the stream here.
[143:04.89]Thank you for sticking around.
[143:05.49]If you were here for Punch-Out, thanks for being around.
[143:09.41]And again, I'm sorry if I missed your sub or I missed your bits.
[143:11.21]I'm really sorry.
[143:11.81]It's just that when I play these Wii games, I have to stand so fucking far away from the screen and I can't even... It's hard to even read what's on the other monitor, so I'm very sorry about that.
[143:32.41]Alright, let's turn this off.
[143:35.13]Maybe I won't have to stop the stream.
[143:37.29]Well, if the stream turns off for some reason, and you ditch out, you take off, then thanks for sticking around.
[143:45.02]I don't think it will have to, but we'll see.
[143:48.98]Hope not.
[143:50.94]Let's turn that off.
[143:55.13]Very happy you played Punch-Out, though.
[143:56.47]If I was concentrating a little harder...
[144:02.73]There was other things going on at the same time for me not to be able to completely concentrate on it.
[144:11.51]Slide into those DMs.
[144:16.07]Okay.
[144:16.79]Hopefully, if the stream turns off, it does.
[144:18.47]I'm sorry.
[144:19.03]I'll turn it right back on.
[144:19.79]I'm going to play Fist of the Frags with our main man, Star, if he's even still around.
[144:27.49]And I'll be right back if so.
[144:29.77]Hold on.
[144:36.57]Maybe not.
[144:38.21]We'll have to test it.
[144:42.08]Okay.
[144:47.10]Menu.
[144:48.42]Turn off the Wii.
[144:57.21]Going to play Fistful of Frags with Kim.
[144:58.67]Maybe one day she would play something like that.
[145:04.55]Maybe one day she'll play.
[145:06.30]She'll be on the stream or something.
[145:07.50]That'd be fun.
[145:11.20]Hold on.
[145:11.70]Sorry about this.
[145:18.47]Just turning off the Wii.
[145:19.51]It's like a process to hook up the PC again to the stream.
[145:22.55]It's annoying.
[145:22.95]Alright.
[145:36.00]this has to be plugged in a different place oh it's a process indeed I'll at least load let me at least uh star if you're here going to go to teamspeak I get you on stream so you can talk while I set things up so it's not so awkward uh hold on
[146:06.69]I can plug this in.
[146:07.51]I wish there was something I could like play right now.
[146:12.59]Yeah, it's a good technical support stream.
[146:17.99]I wonder what made Star want to play Fistful of Frags.
[146:21.57]Did he watch my stream and was like, oh, that sounds like fun.
[146:24.05]I don't know.
[146:26.81]I'm sure we'll find out when we talk to him in about 30 seconds.
[146:44.81]Playback.
[146:46.95]Make sure this is set up right.
[146:50.55]Okay.
[146:53.83]Hey, buddy.
[146:54.43]Hey.
[146:58.95]I got to turn you up.
[147:06.67]What are you talking about?
[147:15.46]Oh, wait.
[147:15.86]Hold on.
[147:16.14]You're not coming.
[147:16.72]Hold on.
[147:18.95]Hold on.
[147:19.47]Hold on.
[147:23.27]Hold on.
[147:24.03]Nobody can hear you right now.
[147:25.03]Hold on a second.
[147:30.84]Oh, it's because of the fucking Wii was plugged in.
[147:32.78]I am going to have to turn the stream off.
[147:37.38]Alright.
[147:37.68]I'll be right back.
[147:38.20]Stream's turning off for like 25 seconds.
[147:41.01]Be right back.
