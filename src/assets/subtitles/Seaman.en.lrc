[00:02.01]Hello.
[00:03.93]Good afternoon.
[00:05.81]And for some of you, good evening.
[00:08.85]Good morrow, maybe for a handful of you as well.
[00:15.49]Yeah, stream was scheduled for tomorrow.
[00:19.50]But, like all things, sometimes you can move stuff around and decided I was going to stream today.
[00:32.22]nice EU time uh four let's see five six three like fifty three thirty three thirty four five six six seven eight nine ten eleven it's like eleven thirty EU right nice game name that I didn't name it alright yeah daylight savings time too I hate that
[00:59.13]There's nothing worse than sitting on your computer, just getting shit done.
[01:06.07]And you're up a little too late, and you know that.
[01:09.53]And it's 12.30 a.m., 1 a.m.
[01:13.94]And you're like, it's alright, I still get to 1 a.m.
[01:16.20]You go up to go to the bathroom, you come back, and all of a sudden, it's 3 a.m.
[01:25.26]How?
[01:25.83]What happened?
[01:27.54]No, this is not fair.
[01:29.06]This is not fair at all.
[01:29.72]I gotta... I have to... No!
[01:31.12]I have work to do!
[01:32.86]And then you have to force yourself to go to sleep.
[01:38.13]And that sucks, always.
[01:39.73]Because you're sitting there lying, like, toy soldier style in the bed.
[01:43.77]Closing your eyes, squeezing them, going like, Fuck, daylight savings time!
[01:50.00]Oh, I'm... I'm well aware, especially for school, too.
[01:53.70]When I was in college...
[01:56.06]I hated it.
[01:57.02]It was the worst thing ever.
[01:58.60]You'd be sitting there looking at your phone or something, or hanging out on your computer.
[02:07.88]And it would just teleport an hour forward, and it just screws you up for like a week.
[02:12.88]But, regardless, happy daylight savings.
[02:20.74]Today we're gonna play Seaman.
[02:25.58]Does the microphone work?
[02:27.90]I don't know.
[02:29.06]Because... Well, it knows it exists.
[02:32.92]I loaded the game up, and it said, Please put... This is Leonard Nimoy, by the way.
[02:36.46]He's the voice of Seaman.
[02:38.64]And the narrator as well.
[02:40.60]So, it did recognize that it was in there.
[02:43.98]I don't know if it works.
[02:46.40]Because I really didn't want to jump into it unless we were all here.
[02:51.04]And that's five Kibiru Dusebs from Hot Take Alert.
[02:56.28]Thanks for the five subs.
[02:57.42]Hot take.
[03:00.74]So this is what we're doing today.
[03:02.24]I don't know how long this is gonna be.
[03:06.31]We'll find out.
[03:07.73]I'm ready to close the lid and get going.
[03:11.47]I bought a counterfeit Seaman mic?
[03:14.65]I don't think that's possible.
[03:15.97]Is that possible?
[03:16.64]You can't buy a fake one, can you?
[03:21.72]I don't think you can.
[03:24.57]Alright, let's close the lid.
[03:25.81]Let me get this over here.
[03:26.85]Hey, you've seen that familiar face before, haven't you?
[03:31.94]That is the Dreamcast.
[03:34.62]Alright.
[03:35.88]See ya man, here we go.
[03:39.52]So, just to give everybody a little intro here as to what the fuck is even going on.
[03:44.86]This, this is the Dreamcast controller as you see, right?
[03:49.64]Only difference is this time, there's a little thing on it.
[03:53.38]This thing right here.
[03:55.35]I have to speak into this to talk to the Seaman.
[03:59.95]And I owned this game when I was younger, but I was too young to understand what the fuck was going on, and how I was supposed to play it in the first place.
[04:08.42]So I got bored because I think I said, like, hello three or four times, and realized it wasn't, like, a fun, like, plat- Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[04:17.26]Hold on.
[04:18.29]You'll witness before you a phenomenon like no other.
[04:21.91]A man of the sea.
[04:23.85]Seaman.
[04:25.50]This legendary creature will be dependent on you for its life's blood.
[04:30.28]You'll begin right here in Gasset's laboratory.
[04:34.02]Where is this laboratory?
[04:36.40]What awaits you within?
[04:38.72]You have no idea what Seaman is or how it evolves.
[04:42.90]This is something you must find out for yourself, as there is little documentation to help you on your way.
[04:50.19]My name is Leonard Nimoy, and I will be your guide.
[04:54.73]Well, this is your first day with the Seaman kit.
[04:59.21]Your first step will involve preparing the tank for Seaman's arrival.
[05:04.06]Adjust the tank settings to be an adequate temperature with sufficient oxygen.
[05:09.40]While adjusting, keep in mind that blue is the color of the sea, and thus an appropriate color for the care of Seaman.
[05:18.23]Then take the egg from the storage matrix and place it in the tank.
[05:22.82]Okay.
[05:23.80]The water's temperature is key to the hatching of the egg.
[05:26.46]So we have to hatch an egg first.
[05:27.82]Once hatched, the nautilus will play a very important role in Seaman's development.
[05:34.21]Each time you visit this laboratory, I'll be here to offer advice and guidance.
[05:40.31]If you're tired of my voice... By the way, it's kind of hard to pay attention because of the fucking deli slicer over here next to me.
[05:47.69]I completely forgot about the deli slicer.
[05:50.98]As you see, press start... What's he saying?
[05:58.04]Oh, look at this calm game where you make a creature...
[06:04.02]That's like all I hear over here.
[06:05.16]And I buried this.
[06:05.94]This is not even on my desk.
[06:06.88]The Dreamcast is over here.
[06:08.79]Down.
[06:10.07]On the ground.
[06:13.21]Does it give or turn a garbage disposal on?
[06:15.47]With a fork in it?
[06:17.93]That's what it sounds like when you play with the Dreamcast.
[06:25.09]Don't... Be careful, by the way.
[06:26.32]That's dangerous.
[06:29.32]Don't ever... Don't even use your garbage disposal.
[06:31.28]It's fucking scary.
[06:33.49]Think of how many horror movies you've seen where the guy, like, reaches in and like... Don't ever have a garbage disposal.
[06:40.85]Just put your... clean your plate in the trash.
[06:46.42]Alright, so... This is Seaman.
[06:50.62]We have our hand here.
[06:53.20]And I think we have to get the temperature in the... Temperature has to be raised.
[06:59.36]Turn the lights on.
[07:06.64]Okay, here we go.
[07:08.16]So, uh, left trigger.
[07:09.22]Here's the egg.
[07:12.27]Food pellets.
[07:13.11]We have to feed it.
[07:17.29]Use voice.
[07:17.81]There's nothing here to use my voice yet.
[07:20.85]Hello?
[07:21.75]No, there's no animal.
[07:24.87]This is the thing that they tell you not to do.
[07:27.27]At every pet store.
[07:28.07]Alright, let's put the egg- I gotta- I need lights!
[07:37.82]Nautilus, right?
[07:38.40]Here's the Nautilus.
[07:39.10]Where's the camera?
[07:44.87]This is the one problem with not having any manual to know.
[07:48.29]Wait a minute, I do have the manual!
[07:58.71]Got it!
[08:02.86]Welcome to Dr. Gassar's live laboratory.
[08:05.59]Thank you for purchasing the Seaman kit.
[08:09.45]Uh, please note that this software is designed only for use with the Dreamcast console.
[08:12.56]Do not put this in a PlayStation.
[08:13.84]Why would you do that?
[08:14.78]This package contains a Seaman habitat and one Seaman egg.
[08:18.44]Thank God I have this.
[08:20.59]I seriously...
[08:23.58]To begin with, let's learn a bit about Seaman, shall we?
[08:26.60]Historical references to Seaman first appeared in the spoken folklore of ancient Egypt, passed down from generation to generation.
[08:33.48]Until recently, it was assumed that the Seaman creature did not actually exist.
[08:37.27]Similar to many other mythical creatures of ancient Egypt, however, in 1997, the discovery of a live Seaman in the Egyptian city of Old Alexandria disproved this assumption, and Seaman came to be known as the World Over.
[08:54.67]While the originally discovered semen specimen died shortly after being captured, its remains were quickly rushed to the foremost biologist research institute in France, where a number of eggs were discovered inside its body.
[09:11.66]We at Vivarium were then able to assist in the endeavor by covering the research and development costs in return for the sole distribution rights that have enabled us to offer this product to you.
[09:28.17]There he is.
[09:30.63]It is well known that as part of its genetic labeling, Seaman passes knowledge onto subsequent human generations orally.
[09:37.89]Furthermore, Seaman has said, do have had a strong influence on the government.
[09:43.30]No, that's not what it says.
[09:44.04]On the progression of ancient civilization.
[09:46.58]But the details of exactly how this was done are not fully understood.
[09:49.26]Welcome.
[09:49.78]Okay.
[09:50.46]A memory card is required.
[09:58.07]The history of semen.
[09:59.01]The man who made the original discovery of semen was a French scientist by the name of Dr. Jean-Paul Gassez.
[10:04.41]Born in 1899.
[10:05.91]Whereabouts are now unknown.
[10:09.41]Dr. Gassez was a member of... Who gives a fuck?
[10:11.42]How do I play?
[10:13.12]Should I read this whole thing?
[10:14.66]I mean, look, this was like a fucking hundred bucks.
[10:18.12]I'm reading the whole thing.
[10:21.60]It was 80 fucking bucks for this microphone.
[10:24.56]And the disc was like 28.
[10:28.23]I'm reading it.
[10:29.01]I'm milking this stream for all it's got.
[10:35.45]The History of Seaman.
[10:39.87]Where were we left off?
[10:40.63]Dr. Jean Paul Gasset.
[10:44.81]Dr. Gasset was a member of a special team of French biologists dispatched to Egypt by the French government in the 1930s when he discovered references to a creature dubbed the Omnipotent Messenger of the Gods.
[10:57.63]Among ruins of the Third Dynasty, he became determined to pursue this line of research and unravel the mystery.
[11:06.01]In March of 1932, in the city of Alexandria, Dr. Gasset happened to meet up with a local resident who had caught a seaman while fishing.
[11:14.18]Dr. Gasset obtained a sample of some of the eggs, which he carried back with him to France.
[11:19.34]When Dr. Gasset returned, he immediately attempted to raise the seaman eggs in his
[11:24.41]Parisian laboratory.
[11:26.66]But, unfortunately, in the midst of his experiment, the seaman died.
[11:32.02]Dead.
[11:32.68]The seaman died.
[11:34.58]Shortly thereafter, Dr. Gasset published a detailed thesis of his work.
[11:38.48]He didn't do very well.
[11:40.97]You put him in a backpack and they died.
[11:43.15]You're going to write about it now?
[11:47.47]Hold on a minute.
[11:49.47]Hold on a minute there.
[11:51.07]There we go.
[11:53.31]Let's see.
[11:55.67]However, after leading academics of the day dismissed the young scholar's work as a publicity stunt, and without the proper evidence, e.g.
[12:04.61]a living specimen, to support his theories, his work was shunned and no one believed him.
[12:13.78]Dr. Cousset's hypothesis suggested that seaman was perhaps responsible for transferring knowledge that proliferated during the Third Dynasty across oceans to other lands.
[12:25.93]This theory eventually became the basis for anthro-bio-archaeology, a highly valued field of study today.
[12:34.73]Soon after the publication of his thesis, Dr. Gasset was dismissed from his post.
[12:38.57]He then disappeared for quite some time.
[12:40.95]Recently, a dire- I don't know, I don't need to read the rest.
[12:43.33]He, like, genetically put his fucking brain in the fish, and that's who you talk to.
[12:46.13]I figured it out.
[12:48.17]He, like, he is the fish.
[12:51.21]Guaranteed.
[12:55.25]Continued research to unravel the details of Seaman's evolution.
[12:57.61]For further details, kindly refer to the following website.
[13:01.77]I don't think this website still works.
[13:04.13]It's www.meetseaman.com.
[13:08.94]I would highly recommend you don't do that website, considering the potential pornographic consequences.
[13:15.86]Because it definitely doesn't exist anymore.
[13:17.28]Alright, here we go.
[13:18.76]Before starting a game, this is the first things first reality check.
[13:22.50]Seaman is a one-player game.
[13:26.33]So, once you begin raising semen, you're expected to assume complete responsibility for the care and upbringing of a living, breathing creature.
[13:32.25]So before you begin with the initial setup procedure, you are strongly recommended to double-check with yourself that you are mentally prepared to assume this important responsibility.
[13:47.44]It's not like buying a- It's not like owning a dog.
[13:49.88]Or a cat.
[13:51.99]This is the conversation.
[13:53.00]Okay, this is the mom.
[13:54.68]This booklet is the mom, and I'm the kid.
[13:56.42]And I just said I wanted a kitty.
[13:59.46]And it's giving me the whole, okay, well, remember, you've got to take care of this cat.
[14:04.17]Are you ready for that?
[14:05.41]You have to clean its litter box, and it's like, yeah, yeah, I will.
[14:08.81]God.
[14:10.49]The first step you must take in preparation is to set up the required equipment.
[14:14.21]At this time, should you experience any tension-related symptoms such as heart palpitations, perspiration, etc., resulting from the sheer weight of the responsibility for rearing a seaman, you may wish to loosen up a bit by stretching or taking a bit of exercise.
[14:31.91]Once you are sufficiently relaxed, you are ready to begin.
[14:34.69]Do not turn the power of the Dreamcast on yet.
[14:46.85]It says it right there.
[14:50.91]Do you see?
[14:52.63]Do not turn the power of the Dreamcast on.
[14:54.53]Whatever, we already did it.
[14:57.70]It's too late.
[15:01.10]Okay, got the memory card in, got the micro... As Seaman matures, there will come a time when it will begin to converse with you.
[15:10.48]A microphone has been included in this package for the express purposes of speaking to your Seaman.
[15:16.62]Whenever you wish to play with your Seaman, always be sure to insert the microphone into Expansion Socket 2.
[15:22.33]No, the VMU must be inserted into Expansion Socket 1.
[15:25.23]The Seaman software will not run if these two devices are not correctly inserted in the right slots.
[15:30.37]Alright, so how do I play?
[15:31.57]Got it.
[15:33.84]Creating a Seaman Habitat.
[15:37.54]Put that down for now.
[15:38.34]Whoa, don't break.
[15:41.00]Just buy the domain already.
[15:42.26]Just buy the- wait, buy the Seaman domain?
[15:50.68]Buy the Seaman Domain.
[15:54.58]And just have it be a fucking picture of this.
[16:09.21]How much is that?
[16:10.31]No, I'm not doing that shit.
[16:13.01]Alright.
[16:13.83]Maybe I'll do it.
[16:21.59]Alright, creating a semen habitat.
[16:24.16]Memory card file, got it.
[16:27.04]Yep, okay, let's figure this out.
[16:30.82]Here we go.
[16:32.49]You see what that says?
[16:34.09]That says mental preparation.
[16:37.45]Mental preparation.
[16:46.36]The most fundamental requirement for successfully raising semen is daily care and maintenance.
[16:54.29]At the very least, you are kindly requested to attend to various custodial tasks such as providing oxygen, water, food, cleaning, etc.
[17:02.89]on a daily basis, just as with a daily exercise program.
[17:06.98]It is important that you participate each and every day without fail.
[17:10.66]This concept is a prerequisite for being a guardian to semen.
[17:16.50]Seaman is a game in which you will experience the growth of a living being.
[17:19.10]You will witness the drama of life over an extended period of time.
[17:23.55]Therefore, do not expect an experience similar to any other games in which clearly defined events happen each time you play.
[17:37.01]This is like 1998.
[17:39.88]They figured this out.
[17:41.40]Neopets figured this out in like 2006.
[17:42.82]Don't worry.
[17:45.97]Uh, this is not the type of game in which one can spend several hours in one sitting and expect to experience vast amounts of action or change.
[17:54.39]As with life itself, change only occurs over time, and even then, slowly, change is only evident through the accumulation of experience over time.
[18:03.94]AKA, do not stream this game.
[18:06.44]You wasted a hundred dollars, idiot.
[18:09.72]Enjoy communicating with Seaman while you attend to these daily maintenance tasks.
[18:14.10]Tap on the glass of the aquarium to get its attention.
[18:16.88]Use the microphone to greet and converse as well as other methods you will discover in order to express your affection to it.
[18:22.78]This is paramount to ensuring the successful growth and development of your Seaman.
[18:28.44]As Seaman matures and reaches a certain level of development, recognition will increase and it will begin conversing with you.
[18:35.99]I have to stream this every day.
[18:38.49]A daily stream.
[18:43.07]Seaman's development will accelerate when in good humor.
[18:46.41]The only way to ensure Seaman is kept in good humor is to take adequate care of it daily without fail, while constantly providing loving affection.
[18:54.85]Although raising Seaman does require a bit of perseverance, it is a bit like writing in a diary.
[19:01.50]Just set the date forward one day.
[19:07.34]Just cheat.
[19:10.60]Just... Should I just make my internal clock like... 2040?
[19:13.98]No, I have to go every day.
[19:16.68]I'm gonna have to turn off the console and go and change the clock every day.
[19:21.15]We're gonna be like four weeks... Oh, this is gonna be a pain in the ass.
[19:29.27]Although raising semen does require a bit of perseverance, it is a bit like writing in a diary, something you need to persist in doing on a daily basis.
[19:38.08]By doing so, you will find yourself experiencing a grand drama the likes of which have yet been rendered possible by even the most realistic of computer or console games.
[19:49.91]For those of you with time to spare, one highly recommended and interesting method for enjoying your time with Seaman is to darken the lights into your room and simply vegetate while watching your Seaman go about daily life.
[20:05.66]Similar to a typical aquarium, but what about working?
[20:08.10]School?
[20:12.79]This is encouraging you to literally not go to work, not go to school, and sit there and vegetate, it says.
[20:20.44]All day.
[20:25.60]Seaman will provide completely different and ever-changing scenery for your television set.
[20:30.66]And for as long as Seaman lives, the show will go on.
[20:41.80]Let's begin.
[20:45.12]That's so, that's weird.
[20:46.64]Were you expected just to have it on, turned on all day?
[20:50.48]Here we go.
[20:51.88]Transfer the egg into the tank.
[20:53.12]Alright, I'm ready.
[20:55.44]Here we go.
[20:57.08]Subsequent, we got, here are the operations.
[20:58.61]Here we go.
[20:59.01]Ready?
[20:59.31]This is, if I, if I didn't have this book, I would be fucked.
[21:03.69]Thank God the people that I bought this from, it wasn't just like a jewel case.
[21:11.53]This game sounds like shitty SCP.
[21:18.69]Relax.
[21:19.85]Alright, operation day one.
[21:20.97]I'm ready.
[21:21.29]Hello?
[21:24.59]Once again, you are urged to review the setup procedure.
[21:26.79]Yeah, I know how to do that.
[21:28.83]Okay.
[21:32.29]Press the open button on your Dreamcast to open the disc door.
[21:36.91]No, this is how to put the disc in.
[21:38.93]Place the disc, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
[21:41.66]Press the start button on the Dreamcast controller to display the raising habitat.
[21:47.99]In the beginning, this will be an aquarium.
[21:49.51]The very first thing you must do is place the seaman egg into the tank.
[21:54.01]L trigger.
[21:57.33]To toggle the display over the storage matrix.
[22:00.45]The milky white object located in the top of the storage is the seaman egg.
[22:06.74]Use the analog thumbpad to select the egg.
[22:08.68]Okay.
[22:12.66]So I've got two here.
[22:15.81]Alright, yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[22:17.73]I know what it said.
[22:18.77]I heard it too.
[22:19.83]But I just swallowed it, okay?
[22:22.20]I, like, no, no, no.
[22:52.95]I just didn't react to it.
[22:56.02]And that's like, oh, wow.
[22:57.38]I said that on purpose, right?
[22:59.42]That's like, has to be what it was.
[23:05.10]Nobody would say that unless they said it on purpose.
[23:07.16]Like, absolutely not.
[23:14.85]God damn it.
[23:15.45]What a fucking idiot.
[23:17.13]Anyways.
[23:18.97]First, transfer the egg into the tank.
[23:27.56]Alright, who gives a shit?
[23:28.46]I'll be fine.
[23:37.36]So, use the analog thumbpad to select the egg.
[23:47.87]And while pressing and holding X, press and hold the trigger to grab the egg.
[23:51.75]Okay, I got it.
[23:58.46]If you are successful, you should see the egg displayed on the clipboard in the lower right corner of the screen.
[24:03.11]In this state, press L again to toggle the display over the aquarium.
[24:07.73]Ooh, shit.
[24:09.43]So you have to hold it the whole time.
[24:12.44]So we go like this, right trigger, left, and now we're over here.
[24:20.18]Next, let go of X and R to release the egg into the tank.
[24:23.08]The clipboard will disappear and the egg will be visible in the tank.
[24:26.26]This process is used when moving items from display to display.
[24:30.44]Whenever you grasp an item, it will appear on the clipboard.
[24:32.85]If you release the item, let go of X and or R before switching to the display in which to release the item.
[24:36.89]The item will return to the original location.
[24:42.75]So let go.
[24:45.41]Where is it?
[24:50.73]Did I just drop it on the ground?
[24:54.61]How do I zoom out?
[24:58.79]How do I, like, zoom the camera out?
[25:02.54]Where's the egg?
[25:10.66]When continuing from a place... Insert the memory card into... How do I turn the lights on?
[25:20.23]This is not dead already.
[25:21.45]How do I turn on the lights?
[25:28.22]Would you like to save and end the session?
[25:30.30]No, not yet.
[25:32.22]Okay, then it says subsequent operation.
[25:38.51]Alright.
[25:39.71]When continuing from previously saved file, only one semen habitat is able to be created on a VMU.
[25:46.74]Therefore, file selection, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25:48.82]Whenever the start screen is displayed, there will be a short narration that reports on the current status of your semen's development and provides a brief explanation of what has occurred previously.
[25:59.21]As there are often important hints and tips on how to proceed offered during this narration, it is recommended that you listen to it carefully every single day.
[26:10.50]If the mushrooms do not evolve within a few days of their hatching, they will die.
[26:14.49]How do I turn the lights on?
[26:22.50]Position the hand over the Nautilus at the bottom of the tank and press R to patiently tap it.
[26:27.53]The Mushroomers will float towards the Nautilus and be eaten.
[26:31.21]Do not be alarmed by this behavior and continue on as normal.
[26:34.18]Once the Nautilus has consumed at least four Mushroomers, it will begin to undergo a transformation, so observe it carefully.
[26:43.31]How do I turn on the lights?
[26:55.54]How do you turn on the lights?
[27:05.71]Before turning on the Dreamcast, flip the light switch.
[27:12.77]Controls, I'm looking at it right now.
[27:15.09]Toggle, once displayed, toggle between each function.
[27:18.19]Use the D-pad to operate the various devices that control the habitat.
[27:26.28]Okay, so we got... Heater, air, light!
[27:39.66]Okay, where's the egg?
[27:43.99]For it's down to hide the habitat panel.
[27:47.33]So what do I need to do for heat?
[27:50.63]How do I clean the tank?
[27:52.55]How do I give mushrooms to the thing?
[27:58.68]Tap it, right?
[28:12.69]Turn on the heat.
[28:14.80]Leonard didn't tell me that!
[28:16.28]Hold on.
[28:17.44]Would you like to save and end the session?
[28:20.10]It didn't tell me what heat I needed to put it to?
[28:22.36]How to interact with a flick seaman.
[28:32.86]Caring for your semen!
[28:36.31]I just had to keep reading, okay?
[28:39.87]Relax.
[28:44.37]Use the D-pad to operate the devices on the habitat operation panel.
[28:48.45]Because the analog design for this device is old-fashioned, you are only able to perform operations such as raising the temperature or increasing the oxygen level of the habitat.
[28:57.82]For the duration, you press the relevant button.
[29:00.33]Once you release the button, the temperature will begin to decrease and the oxygen to dissipate with the passage of time.
[29:17.40]Maybe I haven't prepared myself mentally for it.
[29:19.47]I am absolutely prepared mentally for it.
[29:24.07]Okay.
[29:24.81]Granted, the system used to operate requires far more work than would a fully automated digital habitat system, but let us not forget the benefits that this analog style system provides.
[29:35.46]Perhaps such work will be useful in teaching you a concept that is often forgotten in this fully automated society we live in.
[29:42.38]Mainly that the first step towards conveying true affection for another is through constant attention and care.
[29:48.01]Not through Twitter.
[29:49.11]Not through Facebook.
[29:50.23]Not through Instagram.
[29:51.93]Delete them.
[29:52.83]You don't need them.
[29:53.97]You don't even have to use them.
[29:55.07]Get rid of your Facebook.
[29:56.84]Leonard Nimoy told you fucking 20 years ago this was going to happen.
[30:00.38]Don't use it anymore.
[30:02.92]Go outside.
[30:03.78]Go outside and...
[30:07.37]At least once a week.
[30:12.69]Leonard Nimoy warned us about this.
[30:16.03]It is necessary to maintain appropriate levels of temperature, oxygen, etc.
[30:19.32]in order to provide semen with a suitable living environment.
[30:22.22]Therefore, it is necessary for you to adjust these levels as required.
[30:26.06]To display the habitat operation panel on the screen, the functions that are available for use at the current stage of your semen development will appear on the panel.
[30:34.54]Press this way or that way to toggle between the available functions and then press that way or this way to activate the selected function.
[30:41.34]To hide the habitat operation panel, press... Okay.
[30:46.61]Display the habitat operation panel and toggle until the word light appears.
[30:50.81]Press... I thought that was a house.
[30:54.43]I was like, where's the home button?
[31:02.46]You see that?
[31:05.96]I was like, home?
[31:07.20]It's up.
[31:14.42]It is recommended that normally you keep the light on at the brightest setting in order to observe semen properly.
[31:19.42]Alright, fucking heater.
[31:21.12]Display the habitat operation panel and toggle it until the word heater appears.
[31:24.94]Press and hold up to turn the heater on and to raise the temperature.
[31:29.51]The heater will only activate and operate while the switch is pressed.
[31:33.44]It will take a few moments to get going and then may continue for a moment after the switch is released.
[31:36.64]Practice your timing and above all, take care not to overheat the habitat.
[31:39.60]Just after the habitat is first created, temperature is zero.
[31:43.64]Unlike modern American heaters, the heating units are measured in Celsius, the same scale used by Dr. Gasol.
[31:49.46]This is going to be bad.
[31:50.91]I can't change that?
[31:54.53]It's in Celsius.
[31:55.85]I don't know what that means.
[32:04.19]I just saw the image in the preview.
[32:05.35]That was fucked up.
[32:07.73]Okay.
[32:09.09]To ensure the eggs hatch properly... Are you listening to me?
[32:19.09]Are you listening?
[32:21.91]To ensure... I don't care.
[32:25.66]Whatever.
[32:29.98]I'll never get it right.
[32:32.42]To ensure the eggs hatch properly, the temperature of the habitat should be maintained between 15 and 20 degrees everywhere else in the world besides America.
[32:43.93]After the eggs have hatched, observe semen carefully to determine the appropriate temperature setting and then maintain it accordingly.
[32:50.12]So between 15 and 20 degrees.
[32:56.18]Okay.
[32:57.10]Oxygen supply.
[32:57.86]Okay.
[33:03.13]Imagine not doing this.
[33:04.43]I can't fucking... I'm so glad I did this.
[33:07.98]Remember, like... Display the habitat operation panel until the word air appears.
[33:24.21]Press and hold up to supply a stream of oxygen into the tank.
[33:28.63]The oxygen supply will only continue to increase for the duration you hold it
[33:33.58]Just after the habitat is first created, the level of oxygen is zero.
[33:36.08]When the oxygen level is lower than 50, when it's lower than 50, semen isn't in danger of suffocation.
[33:42.41]The appropriate level depends on the number of living objects in the habitat.
[33:46.31]However, it is safe to assume that this level must stay above 80 whenever possible.
[33:52.31]Alright, let me like just fucking do this first.
[33:55.63]So we've got, here's the menu.
[33:57.79]Heater, 15 degrees, right?
[34:04.02]Okay, that's .05, right?
[34:06.18]Oh, I see.
[34:07.77]It slowly does it.
[34:08.63]Okay, this guy's a bit... 15 to 20.
[34:12.69]Camera's not big enough.
[34:13.55]Oh, fuck.
[34:17.35]Alright, I gotta turn on the generator.
[34:18.59]I gotta let it go, though.
[34:19.47]I gotta let it go, because it takes a minute to stop.
[34:22.74]Right?
[34:29.08]Put it to 100 to do a soft-boiled egg.
[34:34.30]You are fucked up.
[34:35.34]That's not nice.
[34:37.53]Did you think about what you just said before you said it?
[34:42.41]Wow.
[34:48.02]Is he going to suffocate?
[34:48.68]How long does it take to suffocate?
[34:52.46]Probably would have already happened.
[34:55.44]Okay, slow down, slow down.
[35:02.82]I like my eggs over medium.
[35:06.56]Yeah, I know.
[35:07.30]Someone's going to be like, really?
[35:09.32]Over easy?
[35:10.52]No, over medium.
[35:11.88]I like a soft but tangible yolk in the middle.
[35:18.18]Over easy is disgusting to me.
[35:20.68]It just is.
[35:20.98]I'm sorry, it is.
[35:27.61]It's barely even cooked in the middle.
[35:30.15]Alright, 15 to 20.
[35:34.68]Here we go.
[35:35.08]Alright, so I'm gonna keep it in like around like 17 to 18, you know?
[35:38.98]Like... Right here should be good.
[35:43.40]Okay, now we need to do air.
[35:44.93]What did it say for air?
[35:45.87]80?
[35:52.33]This thing... I'm not fucking it up, am I?
[35:56.17]Do you don't drink raw eggs for strength?
[36:00.40]No.
[36:01.44]I don't drink raw eggs for strength.
[36:06.04]Clean the water.
[36:06.72]I don't know how to do that yet.
[36:08.30]I need to read how to do that.
[36:10.78]Let me at least let him breathe.
[36:13.50]Are you guys sour-pleasing to this?
[36:23.81]Holy shit, we can actually see the tank now.
[36:32.20]It said keep it above 80.
[36:37.41]Alright, looking good.
[36:41.82]Who knew that reading would help?
[36:43.28]Right?
[36:43.50]I know.
[36:46.58]Can you have too much air?
[36:49.40]What happens if you have over air?
[36:52.81]Oh.
[36:53.23]That's as high as it can go anyway.
[36:54.49]Alright.
[36:55.33]Cleaning.
[36:55.81]How do I clean?
[36:56.85]Let's get this to higher.
[37:01.05]What happens if there's too much- No!
[37:02.39]Oxygen!
[37:04.71]If there's too much oxygen, it's bad for you, right?
[37:07.51]Isn't that how that works?
[37:09.57]Would you like to save and end the session?
[37:13.50]We breathe CO2, right?
[37:14.92]So if the O2 wasn't there, or if it was too much, it would be like helium.
[37:20.82]It would turn into H2O, which would be helium.
[37:28.05]Now we exhale CO2.
[37:29.53]Sorry, my mistake, scientists in chat.
[37:35.67]Okay.
[37:38.03]Cleaning.
[37:39.49]You will discover that with each passing day, the water in Seaman's Aquarium will become cloudier, indicating a worsening in sanitation condition of the habitat.
[37:47.47]Cleaning the water is simple, and all that you must do is increase the oxygen supply.
[37:51.04]That's it.
[37:52.44]As you do this, you will notice the water become clearer.
[37:55.16]Keep the water clean.
[37:58.36]So you just have to put air in it.
[38:00.76]Just make it oxygenate the water to clean it.
[38:05.91]H2O is water.
[38:07.99]That's hydrogen and then oxygen.
[38:10.85]That's not water.
[38:12.69]Hydrogen is its own thing.
[38:14.05]Oxygen, when you combine them together, you get hydrogen and oxygen.
[38:18.31]Water is water.
[38:19.58]It just exists.
[38:20.78]You're talking about like a chemical made in a fucking lab.
[38:22.42]Alright, please don't leave if you think I'm like actually that stupid.
[38:29.20]Some of you guys might just be like, alright, this guy's fucking out of his mind, I'm out of here.
[38:32.96]Alright, so I need to know how, what was the thing about the Nautilus again?
[38:35.84]The Nautilus down there.
[38:38.79]Alright, feeding your Seaman.
[38:44.21]Press L to switch to the storage matrix, you'll notice 11 food pellets that are used to feed Seaman once it reaches the Gilman stage of development.
[38:51.20]We're not there yet.
[38:54.54]How to say goodbye to Seaman.
[39:01.49]Living in harmony with Seaman.
[39:04.15]Ah, exchanging food with another Razor.
[39:07.37]Advice.
[39:10.07]Final notes and pointers.
[39:12.17]Okay, hold on.
[39:14.31]How do I make the egg hatch?
[39:16.34]Do I have to feed the egg?
[39:17.38]Do I have to inject a syringe into the egg?
[39:23.96]What was the thing about the Nautilus eating mushrooms?
[39:33.25]So this is, okay, we're in day one.
[39:34.92]So day two.
[39:36.56]So, okay, let's just take a look.
[39:40.54]So that's grab.
[39:41.30]So this is to move forward.
[39:44.92]Okay, this is the zoom.
[39:45.66]Yeah, but you know what I mean?
[39:49.32]Like, what, what, can I?
[39:52.94]That's just the egg right there.
[39:53.90]Alright, it's multiplying.
[39:54.86]It's turning into four cells.
[39:59.43]Is this going to eat it?
[40:00.21]He's going to eat this.
[40:11.30]Okay, so now it has to be tomorrow.
[40:16.08]When am I going to eat it?
[40:17.38]No, I can't talk yet.
[40:18.98]I don't have the ability to speak.
[40:21.54]It's called mitosis, stupid.
[40:31.68]Doesn't it take actual days for the game to progress?
[40:34.40]Yeah.
[40:34.60]So how do I save it?
[40:38.69]Okay, how do I change the clock in the Dreamcast?
[40:43.96]It only takes a few minutes.
[40:50.02]I'm gonna have to turn the console off like 30 times this stream.
[40:56.13]I have to go change the date and time until tomorrow.
[41:07.16]Alright, we'll just have to wait for the egg to hatch.
[41:13.10]Save and quit.
[41:14.56]Would you like to save and end the session?
[41:17.64]Okay, you just have to wait.
[41:18.88]But hold on, do I have to wait?
[41:19.86]I think I have to wait until tomorrow is when the egg hatches, so I can't just leave.
[41:23.16]What do you mean no cheating?
[41:29.50]I'm going to cheat the whole day.
[41:32.55]It only takes a few minutes.
[41:34.85]It hatches, okay, alright, alright, hold on, hold on.
[41:37.03]Let me get to the part of the instructional booklet.
[41:47.54]If the mushrooms do not evolve within a few days of their hatching, they will die.
[42:00.90]Whoa, hold on, wait, wait, wait, what do I do about the balloons?
[42:05.47]What, how do I do this?
[42:09.03]We got it, we got life!
[42:12.33]How do I, when do they turn into, uh, sea monkeys?
[42:15.19]What do you mean it died?
[42:20.68]It didn't die!
[42:24.38]So now do I have them get eaten?
[42:34.98]It's not dead, these are like the eggs.
[42:36.68]One of these, some of these are gonna survive.
[42:38.34]I'm gonna make sure I hot wave a heater.
[42:42.06]These are the mushrooms, okay.
[42:44.72]Tap the Nautilus.
[42:56.14]There's too much air in here.
[42:57.20]I don't need too much air.
[42:59.97]It said keep it above 80.
[43:12.43]Uh-oh.
[43:21.66]Hello.
[43:30.70]Oh, shit!
[43:33.13]Look at this!
[43:34.37]Get him!
[43:36.81]Should I be doing this?
[43:43.42]He's gonna get one, he's gonna get one!
[43:46.29]Is this how that you make a semen?
[44:02.25]Now saving, now saving, now saving.
[44:05.07]Whoa, whoa, whoa, he's pissed.
[44:07.42]What did I do?
[44:17.30]Whoa, he got one.
[44:18.36]He actually just got one.
[44:34.91]This is making me uncomfortable.
[44:43.32]Just open a guide.
[44:44.18]I think we're good.
[44:54.07]Okay.
[44:55.71]They aren't dying.
[44:56.45]Don't worry.
[44:56.89]No, I know.
[44:57.29]They're gonna get, like, spit out.
[45:00.20]What's going on up here?
[45:01.22]How's the air?
[45:01.66]How's the heat?
[45:03.72]Heat's okay.
[45:04.44]Air is okay.
[45:07.86]Takes a few minutes.
[45:08.87]We can just chill.
[45:09.57]It's all good.
[45:11.61]How many does he need to eat?
[45:13.72]If the mushrooms do not evolve within a few days of their hatching, they will die.
[45:16.42]Position the hand over the nautilus.
[45:19.00]The mushrooms will float towards the nautilus to be eaten.
[45:20.55]Do not be alarmed by this behavior and continue as normal.
[45:22.63]Once the nautilus has consumed four mushroomers, it will begin to undergo our transformation.
[45:29.19]He's got to eat two more.
[45:39.51]Eat two more of these.
[45:44.41]Come on, grab one.
[45:48.11]Come on.
[45:51.14]What's his problem?
[45:52.08]Eat it.
[45:57.04]He already ate three?
[45:57.96]I think he needs to eat four.
[46:05.13]Does he have a brain?
[46:07.65]Need more air.
[46:08.41]We got plenty of air.
[46:09.25]The heat and the air are fine.
[46:11.45]Come on, grab one, grab one.
[46:13.80]Come on.
[46:14.18]You need one more.
[46:20.83]Come on.
[46:21.33]You need to get one more.
[46:30.20]Come on.
[46:31.56]Down here.
[46:33.94]Come on.
[46:35.48]No.
[46:38.10]No.
[46:39.67]Just go get eaten.
[46:43.54]Did he eat four?
[46:44.04]I thought he only ate three.
[46:46.57]Don't annoy him, just let him be.
[46:47.97]That was weird.
[46:55.29]Alright, so there are only four left in the tank, so that means maybe he did already eat four.
[46:59.63]Alright, so he's gonna shit out a seed.
[47:09.90]So should I go in the clock now and make it like two days later?
[47:14.59]He only eats them when the air is lower.
[47:26.18]I'm not gonna believe that bullshit.
[47:29.34]There's too much air, I can't even lower it!
[47:31.84]So even if that one guy was telling the truth...
[47:43.67]Are you sure you want to continue with this?
[47:44.83]It's a very disturbing experience.
[47:47.89]This was a hundred bucks, so yes.
[47:51.57]This was eighty dollars.
[47:56.42]Eighty.
[47:58.00]What's going on?
[47:58.42]I think, uh, is he doing something here?
[48:17.52]Just use an emulator.
[48:18.54]An emulator can't outdo the microphone.
[48:22.49]This is the only way.
[48:34.58]Whoa!
[48:41.74]What do I do?
[48:42.10]What do I do?
[48:42.56]What do I do?
[48:43.20]Why is he like dying?
[48:55.56]uh save him I don't know how do I is that I can't save him and I want the real experience I don't want the emulator experience
[49:15.55]I want the real microphone, the real controller.
[49:17.73]I want it to be authentic, so when my children come into the world, they can use, they can do it too.
[49:23.92]Check the oxygen.
[49:25.24]You ever good?
[49:30.74]This is actually pretty disturbing.
[49:38.95]I don't think I want to tap.
[49:40.93]He's going through some shit right now.
[49:45.04]Okay.
[49:58.16]Do I have to do anything?
[50:01.57]It looks like he's cooking in a fryer, like he's in a pan.
[50:05.55]Yeah, that's fucked up.
[50:09.18]Yeah, yellow is bad, red is dangerous.
[50:10.58]Yeah, as long as it's blue, it's good.
[50:12.76]It was between 15 and 20 for here and above 80 for this, so we're good.
[50:17.65]Turn off the lights.
[50:20.57]Is that the problem?
[50:34.18]I feel like there's something I should be doing here.
[50:37.48]Turn the oxygen off.
[50:38.60]I can't.
[50:38.98]You can only turn it up.
[50:42.72]Why would anyone buy this game?
[50:44.02]Because it was one of the first video games to allow...
[51:05.61]Would you like to save and end the session?
[51:28.95]Communicating.
[51:30.11]Communicating.
[51:32.14]Once seaman has learned a reasonable vocabulary, try to initiate a conversation.
[51:36.02]In the beginning, it is generally acceptable to address seaman with hey or seaman.
[51:42.07]To do so, a mature seaman will often respond to phrases such as say something or talk to me.
[51:48.12]If you observe Seaman's manner closely, you'll have no problems distinguishing when Seaman is ready to begin conversing.
[51:53.82]All conversations with Seaman must be made via the microphone.
[51:57.42]Be sure to press A for the full duration of your utterance when speaking to Seaman.
[52:02.88]Once each utterance is complete, be sure to release A. Note that the general progress of your conversation with Seaman is indicated by the icons that appear on the LCD screen of the VMU
[52:20.92]Hello?
[52:27.72]How are you?
[52:35.62]What is your purpose?
[52:38.66]What is your purpose?
[52:41.63]Where's the mothership?
[52:46.99]How do you like your tank?
[52:56.41]Are you comfortable?
[53:06.31]Hey, how are you?
[53:10.36]They don't... How do I teach them?
[53:17.02]This one wants to talk.
[53:17.82]This is the one that's closest.
[53:19.22]Look, it keeps coming over here.
[53:21.28]No, no, I want this one.
[53:24.83]Back off.
[53:29.61]Good afternoon.
[53:34.91]Hi.
[53:37.53]Hi.
[53:41.10]Play-doh.
[53:44.62]Chicken strips.
[53:49.42]Crayons.
[53:52.88]Crayon.
[53:57.79]Mac and cheese.
[53:58.81]What are the things kids like?
[54:01.97]School.
[54:02.37]I have one.
[54:08.67]Fortnite.
[54:19.07]I'm gonna teach him the alphabet.
[54:21.37]A. B. C.
[54:29.17]D. Avenger.
[54:33.25]He's going to see the Avengers.
[54:35.89]Progressing here.
[54:37.79]We'll see Endgame, Peter.
[54:42.80]E. Seaman.
[54:47.76]Quaha.
[54:49.70]U. Seaman.
[54:53.56]U. Seaman.
[54:57.35]U. Mono.
[54:59.84]You seaman.
[55:02.68]Seaman.
[55:04.40]Seaman.
[55:05.76]Seaman.
[55:07.29]How do I feed?
[55:11.23]How do I feed them?
[55:20.47]Feeding.
[55:28.17]Once you'll notice 11... Food pellets that are to be used to feed Seam once it reaches the Gilman stage of development.
[55:42.17]Are they at Gilman?
[55:42.67]Not yet, right?
[55:54.11]No, no, no, yes.
[55:55.39]Yes, they are gill man.
[55:56.43]No, yes.
[55:57.67]It's speaking simlish.
[55:59.91]Yes, they are.
[56:00.63]Yes, yes.
[56:01.51]Oh, you guys are saying no.
[56:02.33]You don't know what the hell you're talking about.
[56:05.15]Okay.
[56:06.51]To feed, once it reaches give it to feed semen, use the analog thumb pad to select food pellet and then press and hold, grab it, press L to toggle to the aquarium tank, then release X and R to drop the food into the water.
[56:19.13]Okay.
[56:19.99]The food pellets initially available in the storage matrix will enable you to feed semen for a short time, provided you do not overfeed it.
[56:27.42]However, after that you will need to create an alternate method of providing semen with food.
[56:34.78]What?
[56:35.86]There is no need to panic, for semen may be able to help you to determine a new method for providing food when the time is right.
[56:43.82]So be sure to observe carefully and listen well to what semen has to tell you.
[56:50.74]Is it going to eat its own shit?
[56:53.66]I don't understand that.
[56:57.06]Take the utmost care to prevent using up all the food in the storage.
[57:02.61]You are advised to only feed Seaman when it is hungry.
[57:06.05]Prick up your ears, listen carefully to what Seaman says, and be sure to carry out its instructions in a timely fashion.
[57:18.52]So,
[57:20.94]Hungry?
[57:24.28]Hungry?
[57:27.36]Are you hungry?
[57:32.18]Hungry?
[57:34.51]Yeah, yeah, said yeah.
[57:37.75]Hungry?
[57:40.15]Cool, okay.
[57:48.73]Who gets to eat it?
[58:01.33]They all share the cookie.
[58:02.39]He just stole it!
[58:03.01]He just took it!
[58:07.85]Hello?
[58:19.72]I told you not to feed them.
[58:23.78]What do I mean by not to feed them?
[58:26.54]They're not speaking English!
[58:28.49]How do I know what hungry means?
[58:30.91]Oh, they're going... They're doing, like, reverse speech.
[58:32.78]Like... Like that?
[58:35.20]Hungry?
[58:36.34]How am I supposed to know what that means?
[58:43.36]Yeah, I was right to feed them.
[58:47.06]Are you ready to evolve, Pikachu?
[58:53.06]Is it chilly in the tank?
[58:55.32]I think it's chilly in the tank.
[58:57.05]Hold on, let me see.
[59:02.03]Alright, yeah, it's a little chilly.
[59:07.07]17, about, we'll make it 18.
[59:07.67]Alright, that's a good, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, not too hot, too hot.
[59:15.34]Alright, we're good.
[59:17.52]What's going on over here?
[59:18.22]These are like the mushrooms.
[59:20.12]Are these things just gonna die?
[59:27.22]Didn't, why are there only three of four that are alive?
[59:37.89]Yes.
[59:41.17]Yes?
[59:44.77]Yes.
[59:50.66]How do you teach a kid language?
[59:54.24]I don't know how this works.
[59:55.34]I don't have any children.
[59:57.06]How does a kid learn... I have no idea.
[60:02.48]I have no idea what to do.
[60:03.26]Let's see if any died.
[60:06.15]Um...
[60:08.19]I don't think so.
[60:15.51]No, I think maybe, maybe two died.
[60:20.93]What's, what's a sim, uh, grading?
[60:25.85]Like, like, uh, how do I do a, how do I speak, how do, what's, it's like, it's like, Bravala Mule!
[60:32.48]Bye!
[60:33.62]Right?
[60:37.09]Susu.
[60:38.21]Clap, clap, clap.
[60:43.31]Rataninar.
[60:44.75]Fly.
[60:45.93]Quaha.
[60:49.77]Loompa.
[60:50.71]Loompa.
[60:52.09]Rap.
[60:57.97]Laffy.
[61:00.09]Laffy.
[61:00.88]Laffy.
[61:02.02]Forka.
[61:03.46]Fortnite.
[61:05.40]Forka.
[61:06.53]Pabra?
[61:07.95]Pabra?
[61:10.29]Pabra?
[61:12.37]Yippee!
[61:14.12]Hooray!
[61:15.44]Hooray!
[61:16.66]Fibula.
[61:19.16]Fib... a... a fibula?
[61:21.60]Isn't that an organ?
[61:24.96]A fibula's like here, right?
[61:26.65]Where's the fibula?
[61:31.01]Check the other ones.
[61:31.67]Hold on.
[61:31.87]Hello?
[61:34.69]Hello?
[61:37.91]Hello?
[61:40.59]See, it's reversed.
[61:45.94]I... Are you comfortable?
[61:52.70]Comfy?
[61:54.20]Are the translations in the handbook?
[61:57.67]I don't think so.
[61:59.39]It just tells you when they understand what you're saying.
[62:04.01]Advice.
[62:04.37]Here we go.
[62:05.23]Please realize that...
[62:07.35]Concepts such as goals or scores do not apply to this game.
[62:10.31]You are free to enjoy Seaman in whatever manner you find appropriate.
[62:13.91]However, if you endeavor to successfully raise and assist in Seaman's evolution, there are a few points you must take into consideration.
[62:23.41]Go to sleep.
[62:25.55]Sleep.
[62:26.56]Nombre.
[62:27.70]Okay.
[62:29.86]First off, there's a strong relationship between knowledge acquisition and Seaman's growth process.
[62:35.48]Just follow one around.
[62:36.32]I've got plenty of air, right?
[62:41.72]Just watch this one for a while.
[62:43.84]As Seaman's caretaker, you are encouraged to take the initiative and talk to Seaman daily to stimulate its desire to learn and, in turn, aid its maturation.
[62:55.64]Note that without conversation, Seaman's growth process will stop.
[62:59.10]Therefore, it's important to speak to Seaman throughout its growth and development, even well before it has matured to the stage of being able to converse with you.
[63:05.88]Secondly, it's imperative at some point that you transform the Habitat Aquarium into a terrarium for Seaman, as this is crucial to aiding in its evolution.
[63:19.61]But not to worry, Seaman will assist you in achieving this goal when the time is right.
[63:24.93]Be sure to listen carefully and attentively to all that Seaman tells you.
[63:27.67]Eventually, when an appropriate level of maturity has been reached, you must help Seaman become free of the confines of the habitat.
[63:34.38]How do I transform the habitat aquarium into a land-filled terrarium?
[63:38.02]What environment lies outside the habitat?
[63:40.06]How do I enable Seaman to gain freedom from its confines?
[63:46.72]These are all questions you must be longing to have answered.
[63:50.77]However, we have opted not to provide these answers.
[63:56.01]In this manual, we feel it would be far more rewarding for you to experiment using the exact same laboratory conditions as Jean-Paul Gasset in the 30s.
[64:04.86]We have the utmost confidence that you will be successful in your semen rearing efforts.
[64:20.57]So I just keep stimulating their brains, and then I'm going to turn the clock forward.
[64:26.68]Hello?
[64:28.34]Hello?
[64:30.52]Hello?
[64:30.92]Okay.
[64:37.09]We got attention?
[64:40.21]Hey, how are you?
[64:43.33]You heard any good jokes lately?
[64:44.71]Oinka.
[64:47.29]Oinka?
[64:48.47]Oinka.
[64:50.07]Oinka.
[64:51.25]Molo.
[64:53.23]Read the B-movie script to them.
[65:02.33]I'm not gonna fucking do that.
[65:08.43]I'm not gonna read these children the late six and a half year old meme.
[65:15.41]At least give us something that's more relevant to today.
[65:23.94]Okay.
[65:26.74]I'm gonna fast forward time now.
[65:28.18]Yeah.
[65:31.09]I will fast-forward time now, and then I'm gonna come back and see how you're doing.
[65:33.75]Nome, gnome it.
[65:36.97]How am I gonna do that?
[65:43.06]I don't have speakers.
[65:46.97]Sing him a song.
[65:54.76]O Canada, our home and sacred land, True patriot side, and all thy sons command, With
[66:13.10]spoken word we see thy shine the true north young and wise we're that's all I know any words for that I'm not I don't I don't I'm not canadian why would I know the canadian theme song you know how I'm supposed to know every country's theme song
[66:47.09]I live in the United States of America.
[66:48.99]I've been to Canada twice.
[66:50.65]I'm supposed to know the words to their fucking song?
[66:54.29]Are you serious?
[67:01.89]Twice is enough.
[67:03.79]Wow.
[67:04.71]Can you believe what they just said?
[67:06.39]Cool.
[67:07.39]Cool.
[67:07.63]Alright.
[67:12.03]Should I fast forward now one day?
[67:14.65]I'm going to save it, I'm going to end, and I'm going to fast forward the clock a day.
[67:17.87]And we'll see how they're doing.
[67:22.44]Okay, be good.
[67:24.96]See you soon, goodbye.
[67:27.92]Goodbye.
[67:28.46]I'm not going to fast forward 40 years, they'll be dead.
[67:32.54]I'm going to go one day, come back one day, until they get to be adults and I can talk.
[67:39.52]The tank is not going to be on fire.
[67:42.62]Let's put the heat up.
[67:47.30]to, like, 19.
[67:53.06]And then I have to... Oh, not too hot, not too hot, not too hot.
[67:55.44]Stop before 20, please.
[67:56.54]Put the oxygen, get it to, like, 100.
[67:59.97]Okay.
[68:03.87]Dim the light a little bit.
[68:07.05]Alright.
[68:08.19]Now they're good.
[68:08.85]I should be able to... Save and end the session.
[68:14.69]Go into the clock.
[68:15.75]Make it tomorrow.
[68:18.36]I'm not cooking the fishes, guys.
[68:23.06]You just wait until I get to fucking have a conversation with one of these buttheads.
[68:32.33]There's a cliffhanger in the game.
[68:33.43]The sequel's only in Japanese.
[68:37.14]It's not gonna work?
[68:38.14]Why not?
[68:38.54]Alright, here we go.
[68:44.07]Saving.
[68:45.31]We're locked in now.
[68:47.27]I'm gonna change the date to tomorrow.
[68:50.60]Oh, by the way, I wanted to show you this, because I... You may now turn the power off.
[68:55.00]Okay.
[68:56.04]But before we go any further, you guys need to see this.
[68:58.66]So, I also made sure that I got Space Channel 5, the original Space Channel 5.
[69:03.02]And... I don't... That's like a plan to play this.
[69:08.18]I don't want to open this.
[69:10.45]Because, look...
[69:12.07]This is like original shrink-wrapped packaging.
[69:16.81]Isn't this like an artifact?
[69:17.99]I don't want to open this.
[69:22.41]You know what I mean?
[69:23.03]I don't think I want to break the seal.
[69:28.96]This might be worth like 50 grand in like a thousand years.
[69:34.64]You know, my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren might be able to sell this for, like, fucking a million dollars.
[69:44.63]Here's the crazy thing.
[69:45.25]Okay, imagine, uh, like, this clip is gonna be saved for probably a while.
[69:49.27]I don't know if it's gonna take a thousand years, but let's just say that, like, Twitch, somebody saves this clip on a hard drive, and it gets thrown in the dump somewhere, like, a hundred years from now, somebody comes across it, and they see this clip of me fucking ripping this.
[70:01.84]and they have a heart attack because it's worth like $10 million now.
[70:04.11]We're talking like a thousand years in the future.
[70:07.05]This is gonna be one of those like viral videos that people are like, oh my God, I'm cringing watching him open Space Channel 5.
[70:13.47]It's gonna be worth a million.
[70:14.21]Alright, let me just do this.
[70:22.86]Safe to turn the power off, right?
[70:26.12]Let's fast forward to tomorrow.
[70:35.00]Okay, here we go.
[70:37.23]We're good.
[70:43.95]So now we go to settings to 3-10-2019.
[70:45.31]Date and time.
[70:46.23]Okay, so now 3-11.
[70:46.71]Right?
[71:06.58]This is tomorrow.
[71:14.61]Right?
[71:14.95]Okay.
[71:16.51]Let's go.
[71:17.09]Let's see how they're doing tomorrow.
[71:27.22]That's not month, that's day.
[71:28.48]Holy shit, someone just gave a hundred bucks.
[71:35.66]Why is that not on screen?
[71:39.13]Flying Muffin Man just gave a hundred bucks.
[71:43.93]Thank you for the hundred fucking goddamn dollars.
[71:47.19]And they say, Hey man, you're the best.
[71:48.47]I don't have the attention span to watch streams too often, but it will always be a treat to see a new video up.
[71:54.92]Much love.
[71:57.02]Thank you.
[71:57.98]So much.
[71:58.66]That means a lot.
[72:02.22]Thank you, man.
[72:03.81]Greetings, and welcome back
[72:06.35]You're doing a good job.
[72:10.73]See?
[72:11.05]First, a recap of your previous visit.
[72:13.07]A recap.
[72:13.83]Did you see it?
[72:14.65]Episode two.
[72:15.33]The Nautilus has become prey to the parasitic mushroomers, and thus the gill men were born.
[72:21.67]Gill stands for the gills of a fish.
[72:24.25]So a gill man is a being who breathes underwater.
[72:31.04]Gill man has learned human words.
[72:34.02]Try speaking to him, if you haven't already.
[72:41.77]At the moment, the habitat contains four gilmen.
[72:49.15]They are suffering from the cold.
[72:51.51]Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[72:56.08]So let us get over to the tank.
[72:59.99]Alright, well, Flying Muffin Man, thank you for the insanely generous amount of money.
[73:04.42]Thank you.
[73:05.22]10,000 bits.
[73:05.46]Uh, heater goes down over time.
[73:08.64]Alright, let's go.
[73:09.46]How they doing?
[73:10.54]Hey, kids!
[73:12.04]Dad's home!
[73:16.19]They know words now.
[73:19.99]You shouldn't have gone ahead 24 hours.
[73:23.83]How am I supposed to fucking, uh, you're not, no.
[73:26.22]We're gonna do, where are we?
[73:29.81]Let's see.
[73:30.95]Ooh!
[73:35.13]This is a nice horror movie.
[73:44.71]Okay, I swear to fucking God, this keeps getting stuck on the bottom of my glass!
[73:49.59]But I need it because the coaster... Slow down!
[73:53.84]Don't burn them!
[73:57.68]It just keeps, it's like a suction cup when I lift it up and then it falls.
[74:01.82]Good thing.
[74:03.02]Good thing I got this beautiful new keyboard.
[74:05.60]I want to make sure you guys see this.
[74:08.16]New keyboard, by the way.
[74:09.79]Pause the game, you guys need... Would you like to save and end the session?
[74:14.05]Uh, you know, people have had some recommended keyboards.
[74:17.85]Hey, you should check out the Logitech G1000 or something, right?
[74:21.31]I'm like, yeah, that one looks kind of good.
[74:22.77]Razer's got some fucking awesome keyboards.
[74:25.63]I mean, that's alright.
[74:28.39]I'll stick with my own fucking bread and butter right here.
[74:31.33]Now this is an Amazon Basics keyboard.
[74:40.61]Came in the mail today.
[74:47.30]I believe this keyboard was seven and a half dollars.
[74:49.60]I could be wrong.
[74:52.04]Basic streamer.
[74:53.02]You don't need all the bells and whistles.
[74:55.26]It's just a block.
[74:57.82]Guys, I'm going to tell you the biggest scam in all of human history.
[75:03.60]This is just a plastic brick with letter buttons on it.
[75:08.94]Some people sell you this shit for like fucking 300, 400 bucks.
[75:14.73]It's letter buttons.
[75:19.87]Don't let anybody fool you.
[75:24.60]A $400 keyboard and Amazon Basics $8 keyboard are the same keyboard.
[75:29.48]One just clicks, has like, you know, oh, I got the O-rings on mine.
[75:36.23]We both have the same function.
[75:42.13]Don't fall for the bullshit.
[75:43.77]Same thing with the gamer chairs.
[75:46.23]Look at this thing.
[75:52.80]This is fine.
[75:56.29]You don't need those, like the big thing that comes up, and guess what?
[75:59.97]Hey, I got one of those gamer chairs.
[76:02.19]Alright, yeah, it's nice.
[76:03.75]By the way, the rest of my stream forever has a billboard advertisement of the company that I bought this chair from, that I got this chair from.
[76:14.82]You're a constant advertisement forever.
[76:18.64]If I got one of those chairs, I would just fucking duct tape gun across the whole thing.
[76:26.12]And they come up so high.
[76:27.14]I feel like I'm sitting in one of those, like, the egg from the Men in Black test.
[76:32.47]When Will Smith is doing, like, the test and he's in, like, the fucking egg.
[76:35.23]I don't want to sit in one of those fucking things.
[76:41.15]No, you can go to Staples and get this chair for, like, fucking 80 bucks.
[76:44.43]75 bucks.
[76:44.69]40 bucks.
[76:51.56]You don't need a personalized billboard for a company that you fucking probably talked to twice in emails.
[76:59.15]You know, I got such a good relationship with this chair company, you know.
[77:02.79]I exchanged two emails and they sent one to me.
[77:10.07]Fucking come on.
[77:17.23]That chair is $150, I have one.
[77:20.47]How many emails did you exchange?
[77:21.71]Alright, what do I have to do?
[77:24.59]Oh yeah, the heater.
[77:35.60]They know English words now.
[77:40.49]That bit sucked.
[77:41.33]That wasn't a bit.
[77:42.69]That was me speaking in reality.
[77:49.12]You can tell it's a bit because I'll do the bit voice.
[77:51.95]You know, this is the bit voice!
[77:53.41]Let me tell you something really funny.
[77:55.05]That's a bit voice.
[77:56.31]I was just speaking as Jeremy Elbertson there.
[77:58.53]As a concerned streamer.
[78:03.87]Alright, let's go see what they've learned.
[78:09.03]In a day.
[78:10.65]So a good light heater.
[78:11.81]Let's make it a little hotter.
[78:16.42]You're doing a bit while your kids die.
[78:19.88]Are they hungry?
[78:22.10]Let's check on that.
[78:23.30]They look a little fatter.
[78:25.54]Hello?
[78:29.24]I thought you knew English words.
[78:34.37]You heard it.
[78:37.29]That was such a shitty burp, too.
[78:42.27]That was just a fifth grader burp.
[78:47.35]That was like I chugged a juice box and tried to do a big burp at the lunch table.
[78:56.09]How are you today?
[78:57.77]Hello.
[78:59.94]How are you?
[79:01.20]Number.
[79:03.04]Seamen.
[79:05.26]February.
[79:08.26]Seamen.
[79:09.58]What?
[79:14.60]I...
[79:18.90]English.
[79:20.14]More time.
[79:24.16]Did you say more time?
[79:27.43]English.
[79:29.97]English.
[79:32.13]What's the point?
[79:38.19]Molo.
[79:41.45]Already like a nihilistic fish.
[79:48.31]Crap.
[79:52.70]I don't know what to do.
[79:53.78]I don't know what to say to this.
[79:58.02]The point is... Kamau.
[80:02.58]Food.
[80:05.77]Hungry?
[80:08.27]Hungry?
[80:08.67]No.
[80:09.45]Can I, like, grab it?
[80:22.21]I'm sorry.
[80:24.99]English.
[80:26.69]English.
[80:29.77]To learn.
[80:32.99]Spanish.
[80:36.21]Japanese.
[80:39.25]Japanese.
[80:42.62]English.
[80:46.58]Hurry up.
[80:48.24]Alright, should I feed him?
[80:51.21]Hungry?
[80:54.79]Check on one of your brothers and sisters.
[80:56.09]Where are they?
[81:01.42]Let's try... Wait, where'd you just go?
[81:04.72]Hello?
[81:08.40]He heard it, but he just didn't respond.
[81:09.94]Hello?
[81:10.22]English.
[81:16.30]English.
[81:21.60]I'm learning.
[81:23.30]Very good.
[81:25.54]Very good.
[81:27.34]Good.
[81:30.16]Good.
[81:31.50]Good.
[81:33.28]Good.
[81:34.72]Good.
[81:35.90]Good.
[81:39.01]No.
[81:41.03]Cool.
[81:41.21]Learning.
[81:41.45]Learning.
[81:44.09]Learning.
[81:50.70]More, more, more.
[81:52.42]Good.
[81:54.54]Good.
[81:55.88]Good.
[81:57.22]Very good.
[82:00.60]Very good.
[82:02.27]Good.
[82:04.71]Sick, dude.
[82:08.53]Teach him fuck.
[82:11.01]What am I, like the 13-year-old older brother?
[82:14.23]That has, you know, no.
[82:24.47]Hungry?
[82:26.69]Food?
[82:27.99]Alright, what's he doing?
[82:31.25]Food?
[82:31.55]Should I feed them?
[82:34.25]It's been a day, right?
[82:35.21]I think I have to feed them.
[82:41.80]Are they like a camel?
[82:42.98]Do they eat once a day?
[82:44.36]Once a week?
[82:46.80]How much does a seaman eat?
[82:51.92]Just one pellet a day.
[82:52.72]That sounds good.
[82:55.36]I got 11 of these.
[82:56.06]So I got 11, 10 more days worth of food.
[82:57.85]Alright, let's put it down.
[83:02.69]Go eat.
[83:04.97]Come on.
[83:05.85]Come on, come on.
[83:06.31]Don't let him have the whole thing.
[83:09.79]There's four of you.
[83:10.49]Come on, get over here.
[83:11.77]You're gonna be the... You're dead.
[83:16.85]I love how their feeding is just me dropping one cookie crisp into the tank.
[83:23.97]Ate it?
[83:26.27]Food?
[83:26.51]Good.
[83:28.85]It was good, huh?
[83:33.27]Eat?
[83:35.75]Eat.
[83:37.75]Wake up.
[83:42.58]Yes.
[83:45.16]Yes?
[83:47.11]Yes.
[83:48.65]Yes.

[84:16.79]Food.
[84:17.15]Avenger.
[84:20.59]Food.
[84:20.99]That's how you do it to a kid.
[84:23.13]You go, food.
[84:26.27]And then they get it.
[84:28.31]Food.
[84:29.43]Rap.
[84:34.21]I'm not going to scream into the microphone.
[84:36.19]Good.
[84:38.16]Okay, fine.
[84:47.73]Are you guys all set?
[84:51.58]Okay guys, have a good day!

[85:19.57]Bye.
[85:19.83]Okay.
[85:22.65]Let's see what we got.
[85:26.08]They've been fed.
[85:27.30]We've conversed a little.
[85:30.00]Let's make sure we got a good... Heater's at 8.
[85:31.88]Let's put the... Put it up to like... Just... I'm gonna get this close to 20 as I can.
[85:37.26]Tell them you love them.
[85:37.98]They don't understand that yet.
[85:40.41]Teach them their names.
[85:41.71]They don't know what they... How am I gonna do that?
[85:43.61]They know how to say yes, no, and cool.
[85:46.35]Cool.
[85:58.38]I gotta get this a little higher.
[85:59.22]19- I'll get it to 19.5 and then stop.
[86:07.00]Teach them the value of Bitcoin.
[86:11.16]Do research.
[86:14.40]Do research on market trends before investing.
[86:21.23]Do not FOMO into new things.
[86:27.23]Only invest what you can afford to lose.
[86:40.50]Don't do what Jerma did.
[86:43.44]Implying that I lost a shitload of money.
[86:47.62]Motherfucker, I GAINED money.
[86:50.58]I think I just scared him.
[86:51.28]I scared him out of the tank.
[87:01.39]I have to get this higher.
[87:03.07]Seaman.
[87:05.67]Seaman.
[87:09.51]Seaman, you.
[87:10.89]Seaman, Seaman, Seaman.
[87:16.09]You, Seaman.
[87:18.57]Seaman, Seaman.
[87:22.01]You, Greg.
[87:24.73]Bamboo.
[87:26.91]Seaman.
[87:29.72]Seaman, Greg.
[87:33.12]Seaman Greg.
[87:38.02]Well, they know Seaman.
[87:38.82]Alright, heat is good.
[87:41.20]Let's get the air up to 100.
[87:43.74]Okay.
[87:46.62]Let's see him tomorrow.
[87:53.18]Shouldn't be teaching children how to say Greg?
[87:55.64]What's wrong with Greg?
[87:59.76]Okay, here we go.
[88:24.21]Alright, it's the next day.
[88:28.31]So, maybe I shouldn't be, maybe it should be tomorrow, but not completely 24 hours.
[88:35.43]How's that?
[88:35.81]That looks good.
[88:39.25]Looks fine.
[88:40.27]Alright, let's go.
[88:44.09]We're now two days from now.
[88:51.32]Teach them hatred for other sentient beings.
[88:54.86]Why the hell would I do that?
[89:01.91]I'll go with, like, hungry first.
[89:03.33]You know, like, that's how my niece, whenever we would be hungry, it'd be like, do you, you, this, this?
[89:19.35]And she'd go, and you go, oh, okay, yeah, she's hungry.
[89:24.18]Good morning.
[89:27.06]Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[89:32.96]Greetings, and welcome back.
[89:35.49]You're doing a good job.
[89:39.29]At the moment, the habitat contains four gill men.
[89:46.67]They are suffering from the cold.
[89:49.04]Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[89:53.67]So let us head over to the tank.
[89:55.73]Okay.
[89:57.36]Feed, converse, English, all things that need to be considered.
[90:05.50]Is that a metal straw?
[90:06.50]It sure is.
[90:06.98]It's a metal straw.
[90:11.90]I like it because the straw, if you have a cold beverage, the straw gets cold.
[90:16.84]And it makes it, when liquid goes up through the tube, it's colder.
[90:21.58]I like the way it sounds.
[90:23.14]I like the way it feels in the mouth.
[90:26.60]I prefer metal or copper straws.
[90:28.43]Alright, how we doing?
[90:33.31]Hi.
[90:37.03]Hi.
[90:37.27]Hi.

[90:52.43]Talk more of that.
[90:58.19]Cold, cold, cold, cold.
[90:59.39]Right, right, right.
[91:00.49]I'm just going in there going, English.
[91:02.21]Speak English.
[91:05.13]It's cold.
[91:06.43]English.
[91:06.85]Yeah.
[91:11.77]They're already tanked, too.
[91:18.55]Alright, alright, relax.
[91:21.55]Don't, like, go more than 17 for now.
[91:27.23]Which one's the more talkative one?
[91:29.53]That's the one you have to find.
[91:34.87]Okay, talk a little bit, feed them.
[91:39.55]How do I do interactions?
[91:41.89]Wait, I can interact with them?
[91:42.83]Talk to all of them equally.
[91:43.61]I can't do that.
[91:44.01]That's too hard.
[91:44.65]Good morning.
[91:45.03]Good morning.
[91:45.51]Hi.
[91:45.63]Hi.
[91:45.79]How are you?

[92:21.08]So I can understand you.
[92:24.72]So I can understand you.
[92:28.81]For me to understand you.
[92:33.35]Let's talk.
[92:40.17]What's your favorite food?
[92:43.64]My favorite food is pizza.
[92:46.50]Hi.

[93:01.03]Mine's pizza.
[93:02.99]Hi.
[93:07.65]Hey.
[93:11.39]Hello?
[93:13.76]English.
[93:16.10]Nyet.
[93:17.96]This is, that was Jerma.
[93:21.46]Fliberal.
[93:22.18]How would you, how would you learn Jerma?
[93:23.80]I haven't said any Jerma words.
[93:26.95]No, nyet's Russian, not Jerma.
[93:29.65]Nine is Jerma.
[93:31.59]Russian.
[93:33.03]Hoi.
[93:33.89]Why is he speaking Russian?
[93:35.77]Marmarmar.
[93:38.57]Russian.
[93:40.65]Russian.
[93:41.71]Kamauu.
[93:43.29]English.
[93:47.57]Good morning.
[93:50.61]Good morning.
[93:51.87]Pee blood.
[93:53.47]Good morning.
[93:55.65]Good morning.
[93:56.91]Halloray.
[94:01.95]Pee blood?
[94:03.05]What are you talking about?
[94:05.37]It's been nice talking to you.
[94:06.57]Are you hungry?
[94:07.19]Night night.
[94:09.71]Night night?
[94:12.45]Good morning.
[94:14.33]Play, play, play.
[94:15.87]You want to play?
[94:16.41]Alright.
[94:17.00]How do you?
[94:17.24]Would you like to save and end the session?
[94:19.40]How do I do that?
[94:19.96]He wants to play.
[94:26.63]Advice.
[94:28.47]Exchanging food with another razor.
[94:31.81]Living in harmony.
[94:33.17]Okay, if a seaman is in a bad mood, it will elect to discontinue conversation with you.
[94:38.75]Whether the cause of this mood swing is inadvertent or intentional on your part is of no relevance.
[94:44.05]The following situations have been noted to cause a deterioration of seaman mood.
[94:49.35]If you are violent towards or speak rudely to seaman, if you're constantly using strange or foreign terms that seaman does not understand,
[94:58.89]If you willfully and consistently repeat the same types of words over and over, like pizza.
[95:07.16]If you fail to feed semen over an extended period.
[95:10.06]If you fail to maintain a suitable living environment.
[95:12.48]If you willfully and continuously flick or grab and pick them up.
[95:18.09]Pay attention to semen's health.
[95:20.81]Seamen is a living creature.
[95:22.57]In order for semen to remain healthy, it is an absolute must for you to provide food, oxygen, and a clean living environment.
[95:29.61]Pay careful attention to the state of the water and oxygen levels.
[95:33.35]Keep in mind that if you are away and unable to attend to semen for a couple of days, semen could possibly die.
[95:40.23]So if I'm away for more than a day or two, they can die.
[95:45.78]So how do I interact?
[95:48.76]Is feeding...
[95:51.34]This carrying.
[95:52.88]How to interact.
[95:53.74]Okay.
[95:54.33]Tapping the glass with R. Flick.
[95:57.29]While locked on in a close-up, position the hand icon over Seaman and press and hold R for a few seconds till the icon changes as illustrated.
[96:04.35]Then release it to flick.
[96:06.87]However, note that if you do this too often, Seaman may begin to dislike you.
[96:11.09]This also tickle.
[96:13.17]Use the zoom function to zero in on Seaman and position the hand over it.
[96:16.64]Then press X repeatedly.
[96:19.56]This will put Seaman in a good mood.
[96:22.27]Okay.
[96:26.79]Note.
[96:27.79]Do not attempt to tap, flick, or tickle other household pets.
[96:32.38]Wild animals outside of the Seaman kit.
[96:36.38]Seaman is a very special creature that will respond to such stimuli.
[96:39.64]However, other animals not in the Seaman kit have been known to become far more aggressive when administered such contact and it is not advised.
[96:49.74]Yeah, don't do that to like any birds.
[96:53.25]Alright, so here we go.
[96:55.31]So... I'm sorry.
[97:07.96]Okay, what was the other one?
[97:18.00]Alright, that's how you just tap that.
[97:20.22]That's like, okay.
[97:24.60]So I have to make them all happy.
[97:29.22]Hello.
[97:32.44]English.
[97:35.43]English.
[97:35.75]So we're just gonna like pet them all.
[97:44.68]Only focus on one seaman.
[97:46.68]People are just pissed off because I was only focusing on one of the children.
[97:52.23]Who's the smartest?
[97:54.75]Hello.
[97:56.99]Hello.
[97:57.47]I think we found the smart one.
[98:01.69]Food?
[98:02.78]Hello, Ray.
[98:04.32]How are you?
[98:06.72]How are you?
[98:07.74]Clip, clip, clip.
[98:18.21]Don't do this to a wild pig you find If you see a bear don't run up to him and be like hey bear, how are you?
[98:27.94]You're gonna get your fucking face ripped off Is that how why would you do that in the first place?
[98:37.35]Come here fine
[98:40.78]Does it really have to give a warning?
[98:41.90]Are people gonna sue this company if somebody tried to, like, pet a bear because they played a game about sea monkeys?
[98:49.96]Having fun?
[98:52.19]Are you having fun?
[98:53.01]Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.
[98:56.85]Let's play!
[98:57.51]Play!
[99:07.61]Having fun?
[99:17.45]Um, okay.
[99:18.19]In 1776, Columbus signed the Declaration of Independence.
[99:23.63]And then the British invaded, and we repelled them.
[99:29.78]And then we gained our independence.
[99:32.20]And then a couple of big wars were fought between lots of countries.
[99:40.51]and then the computer came out and AOL was the first internet provider and then there was Netscape was a browser that eventually turned into Mozilla and after that there was faster internet and when the faster internet came out everybody lost their minds
[100:10.87]And that's kind of where we are now.
[100:16.93]You should be a history teacher?
[100:17.93]I'm condensing it all!

[126:47.82]Don't keep repeating words.
[126:48.98]Okay.
[126:50.98]I'll put up a thesaurus and start saying different stuff.
[126:56.41]Alright, how we doing?
[126:56.95]Let's say goodbye.
[126:58.01]Let's get this to about like 19... Like 6.
[127:05.30]Looks good.
[127:06.04]Oxygen's up.
[127:07.54]Let's dim the lights a little.
[127:09.92]And... Let's go.
[127:14.85]See you tomorrow.
[127:15.27]Hopefully you're both still alive.
[127:32.35]Let's see what happens.
[127:45.15]Do English lessons?
[127:50.69]There we go.
[127:51.03]3.13.
[127:51.97]Let's make it 3.14.
[127:53.11]And make it so it's been less than that, 24 hours.
[128:01.76]314, that's correct.
[128:02.97]314, let's go ahead and close it.
[128:14.43]The Dreamcast is gonna die before Seaman does.
[128:22.50]Read them green eggs in hand.
[128:34.66]Jeremy, do you have any gray hairs?
[128:36.28]I don't know.
[128:38.24]Probably not.
[128:41.32]I don't think so.
[128:41.88]I've had Kim examine my head a few times.
[128:45.94]We're good.
[128:46.84]It's like 4 a.m.
[129:01.98]Like I'm shit-faced after like a night of partying.
[129:04.39]The gill men have begun to suck each other's blood.
[129:06.93]What?
[129:07.33]Using the tubes on their heads.
[129:09.65]Did you notice?
[129:13.67]The number of gill men has decreased due to natural selection.
[129:18.18]It seems cruel, but survival of the fittest is an integral part of their lives.
[129:28.18]At the moment, the habitat contains two gill men.
[129:35.51]They are suffering from the cold.
[129:36.95]They always are.
[129:37.87]Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[129:45.01]Allow me to give you the highlights for today.
[129:47.01]Highlights?
[129:48.99]I'm not sure, but it seems that Seaman wants a name.
[129:53.54]Pay close attention to what he says.
[129:56.59]So let us head over to the tank.
[129:58.07]This is important.
[130:04.25]Alright, Garfield and... Garfield and... I don't know.
[130:19.06]Greg, right, Greg, Greg, Greg.
[130:21.15]Ah, here we go.
[130:26.75]Ah.
[130:31.32]No longer a baby.
[130:34.40]Hey, it's getting cold.
[130:36.72]Turn the heat up.
[130:37.84]I will, don't worry.
[130:45.81]So one of these two is going to eat each other.
[130:47.15]Let's just put it to 100.
[130:53.87]Uh, heat.
[130:54.23]Let's get a little hotter.
[130:55.03]Yay!
[130:55.73]They want names.
[130:58.89]Oh, goody.
[131:05.98]It's about time.
[131:10.40]That's much better.
[131:14.00]Is that George Takai?
[131:16.24]It might be.
[131:16.88]Slow down.
[131:17.36]Don't go too hot.
[131:21.81]Alright, that's good.
[131:22.53]So how we doing?
[131:23.01]Let's take a look.
[131:26.49]Hello.
[131:28.83]Yeah, hello.
[131:31.08]Whatever.
[131:34.04]What's wrong?
[131:38.22]Eh?
[131:40.44]I must say, you've taken very good care of me up to this point.
[131:46.76]Thank you.
[131:49.22]No, leave me alone.
[131:54.09]I heard you wanted a name.
[131:58.67]What is your name?
[132:02.53]What is your name?
[132:10.91]What's your favorite color?
[132:14.73]They're not children anymore.
[132:16.21]Hey.
[132:20.15]Let's take it down a notch, huh?
[132:24.14]Hey.
[132:27.58]Hey.
[132:29.86]Hi.
[132:38.43]I love you.
[132:38.93]What?
[132:44.93]Male.
[132:45.17]Okay.
[132:45.45]Yes.
[132:45.55]Not really.
[133:20.65]Probably should feed.
[133:22.17]Are you hungry?
[133:26.47]No, leave me alone.
[133:29.91]Do you want to play?
[133:32.88]What do you want?
[133:35.71]So I was led to believe I would be cared for by a fairly young, responsible human being.
[133:42.60]Right.
[133:43.36]So far this has proven to be true, but I am wondering about your age now.
[133:50.27]Tell me, are you in your, um, 20s?
[133:52.59]No.
[133:58.72]Oh.
[133:59.58]Hmm.
[134:00.30]That hurts.
[134:01.18]Well, then perhaps you are a teenager.
[134:04.58]Is this correct?
[134:07.04]No.
[134:08.94]Alright, I'm tired of guessing.
[134:11.31]How old are you, then?
[134:16.23]Thirty-three.
[134:18.43]You're thirty-three years old?
[134:21.86]Yes.
[134:23.54]Yes, a 30-something.
[134:26.70]The body doesn't feel as good the next day after a night of revelry.
[134:32.61]You can't stay up as late.
[134:34.93]It's tough growing old, huh?
[134:38.31]Yeah, you got that spot on.
[134:40.05]You got that spot on.
[134:42.77]What is it?
[134:45.47]So, what month is your birthday in?
[134:51.29]Docs me?
[134:53.49]Where do you live?
[134:54.17]What month is your birthday?
[134:55.33]What's your mother's maiden name?
[134:58.17]September.
[134:59.93]So what's your answer?
[135:02.49]Let's try that last question I had for you before again, shall we?
[135:08.09]So what month is your birthday in?
[135:12.44]September.
[135:14.30]You were born in September?
[135:16.24]Yes.
[135:18.93]You know, autumn babies are often melancholy adults.
[135:24.41]Not that I mean to imply anything, I'm just saying... He's kind of a 33-year-old fucking... Oh, I've stuck my fin in my mouth.
[135:30.52]Melancholy guy.
[135:31.44]He's just kind of roasting me, yeah.
[135:42.28]All I have is, he's just destroying me with this, like, fucking fax and all this awful shit, and I'm just like, what's your favorite color?
[135:48.88]What's your favorite food?
[135:49.91]Ugh, I gotta... Hey.
[135:55.79]What's your birthday?
[135:58.27]July 29th, 1999.
[136:02.15]That's odd, considering you're only three days old.
[136:04.40]That's very weird.
[136:11.01]What are your aspirations?
[136:14.45]What are your goals?
[136:17.43]What do you like?
[136:19.95]Hey, why all the noise?
[136:22.71]What do you like?
[136:26.49]What do you like?
[136:29.41]Yes.
[136:32.03]So, what day is your birthday on?
[136:45.30]Alright, let's try that one more time.
[136:49.06]What day were you born?
[136:53.88]Let's think about what you said, shall we?
[136:56.78]You guys are going to get my name, my birthday.
[137:03.37]Fourth.
[137:05.47]Let's take it down a notch, huh?
[137:15.67]Anyways, how has your day been?
[137:19.35]No, go away.
[137:21.99]Fine, I'm gonna do the streamer joke.
[137:24.45]Are you ready?
[137:25.69]You all here?
[137:26.23]There's almost 6,000 people here.
[137:28.60]I will do the fucking streamer joke, the YouTuber joke.
[137:31.34]Here we go.
[137:38.52]Fuck you.
[137:42.61]You can go away.
[137:45.90]It's really not a difficult question, I said.
[137:50.66]So, what day is your birthday on?
[137:55.11]Fourth.
[137:57.17]What's all that racket?
[138:01.73]I said the fourth.
[138:14.67]I'm not paying any attention to the brother.
[138:19.27]He's gonna fucking Borg this motherfucker anyways.
[138:22.21]Who cares?
[138:23.08]This is our Seaman.
[138:24.88]What is your name?
[138:27.24]Seaman.
[138:28.90]Seaman Jones.
[138:33.66]It's really not a difficult question.
[138:36.74]I said so.
[138:39.82]What day is your birthday on?
[138:43.00]Four.
[138:44.59]The fourth?
[138:46.80]Yes.
[138:48.80]Well, I'm sorry, but don't expect any presents from me, okay?
[138:53.72]I'm just a poor seaman trying to make ends meet.
[138:56.80]Liar.
[139:00.26]Are you hungry?
[139:04.43]No, thanks.
[139:06.77]Can I still, like, pet him?
[139:08.35]Or is this, like... Is it gonna be... Is it, like...
[139:18.72]Don't make me laugh.
[139:22.46]I'm gonna pee if you don't stop.
[139:24.22]I don't know what to say.
[139:34.23]I thought he wanted a name.
[139:41.11]Pick him up.
[139:41.59]I'm not gonna... No, I don't want him to hate me.
[139:46.05]Good afternoon.
[139:48.61]No, it's not.
[139:52.37]What time is it?
[139:56.56]Hello?
[139:58.98]What time is it?
[140:01.76]Now, where on Earth do you think I could wear a wristwatch?
[140:09.07]Decrease the oxygen in the water, but don't do enough to kill him.
[140:11.41]Just starve his brain of IQ.
[140:13.47]That's fucking diabolical.
[140:15.43]What is wrong with you?
[140:18.04]Drop the oxygen in the tank to starve his brain of oxygen so his IQ drops.
[140:28.75]I will name you.
[140:29.73]I will name you.
[140:34.11]So what are you looking at me for?
[140:39.08]I want to na- I've been thinking about this, and if my calculations are correct, you must be a virgin, right?
[140:47.93]I meant Virgo.
[140:50.73]Sorry, I know Virgos are very sensitive.
[140:53.79]I hope I didn't hurt your feelings.
[140:56.93]Well, I'm not, so, sorry.
[140:57.69]Honestly, it's none of my business what you do in your free time.
[141:00.47]Hey.
[141:02.73]Oh, what's up?
[141:03.17]No, I'm not a virgin, actually.
[141:06.03]What about you?
[141:08.46]What about you?
[141:09.04]I am Seaman.
[141:13.31]Applause, please.
[141:16.07]Uh, because to me, you're kind of just been in a tank this whole time.
[141:22.78]Decimated by Chad Jones.
[141:24.64]No, actually, he gave me a false statement and I threw it right back in his tank and he didn't even want to respond.
[141:34.60]What's up?
[141:36.80]Alright.
[141:37.84]Let's see the other ones.
[141:39.44]As much as a dick.
[141:43.52]Where is the other one?
[141:45.34]Up here.
[141:46.92]Hey.
[141:49.06]Hi there.
[141:51.71]Hello.
[141:53.79]Hello?
[141:59.17]Hello?
[142:01.11]This one doesn't want to talk.
[142:03.21]Are you there?
[142:05.61]Are you there?
[142:06.23]Okay, this one's dumb.
[142:10.87]He just swam his head into a pole.
[142:14.22]I think this one's just food.
[142:15.32]Yeah.
[142:16.98]This one's just food.
[142:21.36]Alright, let's get the heat up a little.
[142:23.40]Try one more time.
[142:36.16]Good morning.
[142:39.26]Good morning.
[142:45.49]Ow.
[142:46.37]Knock it off.
[142:47.11]Are you awake?
[142:50.59]Excuse me.
[142:52.91]What's the problem?
[142:53.65]Finally, Jesus.
[142:56.37]What is your name?
[142:58.78]Seaman.
[143:00.44]Seaman...
[143:02.38]Jones.
[143:03.20]You both can't be Seaman.
[143:05.12]That's not your name.
[143:07.85]I am Seaman.
[143:09.07]Hear me roar.
[143:12.07]You are not.
[143:13.75]That was interesting.
[143:15.73]We'll speak again soon.
[143:19.05]Is that me telling him that he doesn't want to talk to him anymore?
[143:24.98]What do you want to be when you grow up?
[143:29.84]What's up?
[143:32.33]What do you want to be when you grow up?
[143:36.62]No, leave me alone.
[143:38.10]We're good.
[143:57.47]Anybody hungry before I go?
[144:07.24]No, not yet.
[144:09.38]Okay, so let's go.
[144:12.09]He said he's not hungry.
[144:13.01]Feed?
[144:13.39]I guess I have to, right?
[144:14.37]I'm gonna be gone for a while.
[144:18.31]I'm still full.
[144:20.35]Are you trying to fatten me for slaughter?
[144:24.41]Pick it back up.
[144:24.77]It's alright, it's alright.
[144:30.65]Just leave, leave, leave, leave.
[144:31.45]Get out.
[144:31.63]Would you like to save and...
[144:34.98]Tomorrow.
[144:35.40]Next day.
[144:36.60]I'm completely invested in this now.
[144:38.36]I need to know everything about him.
[144:44.01]Alright.
[144:45.01]Let's try it again.
[144:48.25]Oh, I can... Okay.
[144:49.41]So this is technically... This is going on five days game time, right?
[144:58.54]I think.
[145:00.78]Should be, right?
[145:08.28]Uh, 3, 15.
[145:09.84]No, no, no, no, no, back it up.
[145:11.88]It's right there.
[145:18.18]3, when did we start?
[145:20.71]I don't remember, like, the 10th?
[145:23.09]We started, what, I've lost track of time.
[145:24.95]I don't even know what day it is now, in real life.
[145:27.59]The 10th, right?
[145:32.33]This is playing with my brain.
[145:33.37]Alright, here we go.
[145:34.33]See if any of the new developments...
[145:47.54]This whole game is an elaborate phishing scam.
[145:49.36]In a few days the seamen will access your bank account info.
[146:04.31]What happens if you set time backwards?
[146:09.29]That's a really good question.
[146:10.24]I have no idea.
[146:11.26]Would the game just break?
[146:13.46]Or would they revert back to eggs?
[146:15.26]Good evening.
[146:17.87]Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[146:23.69]Greetings, and welcome back.
[146:26.21]You're doing a good job.
[146:30.01]At the moment, the habitat contains two gill men.
[146:37.58]They appear to be very hungry.
[146:42.88]Let me divulge the highlights for today.
[146:47.05]Would you like to give Seaman a name?
[146:49.97]Call one of the Gilmen and try saying, I will give you a name.
[146:53.93]I will give you a name.
[146:55.21]So let us head over to the tank.
[146:58.92]So I have to feed immediately.
[147:05.72]Greg and Garfield, yeah.
[147:11.51]Chad.
[147:11.97]No, that's too easy.
[147:20.33]I'm hungry.
[147:21.75]Alright, just eat.
[147:25.03]Give me something to eat.
[147:26.81]I'm star... Hey, thanks.
[147:31.40]Where's the other one?
[147:34.38]No, turn it on again.
[147:36.58]Where's the other one?
[147:37.02]The other one didn't get to eat.
[147:42.83]Do I have to drop another one in there?
[147:44.21]The other one?
[147:44.93]My complex to the chef.
[147:46.01]Or do you just say, fuck that guy and get this one?
[147:49.07]How about turning up the heat?
[147:51.97]You're blowing him away from the food.
[147:58.60]Peaceful.
[147:59.80]Let's heat it up.
[148:08.10]So he ate this one over here on the right.
[148:19.63]Now we're good.
[148:24.72]Slow it down.
[148:25.36]It should stop at about 19 something.
[148:28.50]Hey.
[148:31.58]Hi.
[148:33.94]Shouldn't you be out partying or something?
[148:38.52]I mean, this is technically a party.
[148:40.22]I will give you a name.
[148:45.39]Okay, I'm going to let you give me a name.
[148:48.75]When you've decided what you want to call me, say, I'm ready.
[148:53.53]I'm ready.
[148:55.39]Alright, then.
[148:56.51]Here's how to do it.
[148:57.99]You're going to say my new name three times.
[149:01.35]Each time I say now, say the name once.
[149:05.07]Got it?
[149:06.25]Now.
[149:07.73]Greg.
[149:09.51]One more time.
[149:11.33]Greg.
[149:13.15]One more time.
[149:14.63]Greg.
[149:16.72]Okay, I'll remember that.
[149:18.80]Next time you want to call me, call me using that name.
[149:22.62]And don't forget the name you gave me.
[149:25.54]Cause if you do, I'm not going to tell you what it is.
[149:29.54]Well, I think that pretty much covers it.
[149:32.66]Later.
[149:33.04]Hey, Greg.
[149:36.44]Greg.
[149:38.80]Okay, just be sure to save some for later.
[149:42.39]What?
[149:42.55]Alright, now I gotta give you a name.
[149:50.16]I will give you a name.
[149:53.06]I will give you a name.
[149:56.74]I will give you a name.
[149:59.94]Hey.
[150:01.98]Hey.
[150:03.28]Food.
[150:04.53]Here.
[150:06.07]No, why?
[150:07.31]He's gonna become food and he's gonna be eaten by his brother.
[150:09.85]Why is this one the smork?
[150:18.43]Go get it.
[150:19.07]Oh, good.
[150:20.01]Food.
[150:23.21]Right here.
[150:31.69]Now will you talk?
[150:37.20]There you go.
[150:38.08]Okay.
[150:40.92]Hi.
[150:43.66]I will give you a name.
[150:44.52]I will give you a name.
[150:49.12]My compliments to the chef.
[151:02.28]I'm gonna pee if you don't stop.
[151:04.38]Listen.
[151:07.04]Listen.
[151:09.55]Not right now.
[151:14.51]You are the dumb one.
[151:17.95]You're the dumb one.
[151:20.00]And you are just food for your brother.
[151:21.95]I just want to make sure you're aware of that.
[151:23.87]I have to make it very clear.
[151:26.75]You are in this tank to provide sustenance to the smart one.
[151:37.86]Doesn't seem to care.
[151:51.23]You hungry?
[151:53.64]Greg.
[151:56.12]Greg.
[151:58.02]Hey, Greg.
[152:00.50]What do you want?
[152:03.13]Greg, come over here.
[152:15.07]Does he pee?
[152:16.21]Do they actually pee?
[152:19.79]I'm gonna pee if you don't stop.
[152:24.19]Don't make me laugh.
[152:26.85]Be nice to your brother.
[152:33.25]I can't see anything.
[152:38.67]I share a name with the Seaman, so it's throwing me off.
[152:41.05]Hey, Greg.
[152:42.03]Greg.
[152:45.12]That would be really weird.
[152:48.64]Clean the tank?
[152:49.32]The only way you clean the tank is you just put air in it.
[152:57.14]Hey, Greg.
[153:00.96]Greg.
[153:03.35]Great.
[153:04.09]Now everyone will want one.
[153:06.63]Want one?
[153:07.13]What are you talking about?
[153:09.33]Greg.
[153:09.55]What the fuck was that?
[153:11.45]Adieu.
[153:13.75]What the hell is this?
[153:17.37]What is that?
[153:17.77]Is it an egg?
[153:26.29]What is this?
[153:34.29]Whose egg is this?
[153:37.07]Put this tongue in that mouth.
[153:40.15]Dream on.
[153:45.45]That's poop?
[153:47.86]Uh, there's no way that's poop.
[153:49.46]That did not... A big brick cement shit like that did not come out of one of these things.
[153:56.71]There's an egg.
[154:04.03]That's a big ball of shit, okay.

[154:12.14]Hey, Greg.
[154:14.38]Hey, settle down there.
[154:16.84]Let's play.
[154:19.22]Do you want to play?

[156:00.59]You have, like, a Twitch chat room right now.
[156:03.05]You've got all kinds of forums, you've got, like, Reddit.
[156:05.45]Back in my day, we had Diablo II Battle.net and, like, wrestling fucking chat rooms.
[156:12.59]That's all there was.
[156:20.14]I didn't have a Twitch chat.
[156:22.64]I had a Diablo II chat in a random Battle.net server.
[156:36.50]It was incredible to talk to somebody on the other side of the world back then.
[156:39.06]It was.
[156:39.38]And kids these days don't even realize.
[156:46.67]When you talk to somebody from Japan 20 years ago,
[156:51.87]It was like... Boom!
[156:55.17]Your brain just could not comprehend it.
[157:02.13]Let's have a conversation.

[158:51.50]That's fine.
[158:52.04]3-16.
[158:54.12]That's the Stone Cold number.
[159:09.25]I wish I could have experienced the dawn of the internet like you.
[159:13.13]It was pretty weird.
[159:13.71]I remember playing Command and Conquer.
[159:17.27]Red Alert.
[159:19.88]It was like neighbors.
[159:22.96]It was wild.
[159:30.15]It was a weird time.
[159:31.07]Yeah, you just build power plants into the other person's base and then send 20 Tanya's over there.
[159:36.10]That was the strategy every time.
[159:37.46]Greetings, and welcome back.
[159:43.30]You're doing a good job.
[159:47.97]First, a recap of your previous visit.
[159:50.71]You have given a name to one of the gill men.
[159:53.65]His coloration has changed, so you should be able to locate him easily.
[159:59.08]Please, take good care of him.
[160:01.58]So that's the one that we have to take care of?
[160:05.00]Oh, yes.
[160:06.24]They have started to produce droppings.
[160:09.06]The tubes on their heads serve many purposes.
[160:16.89]At the moment, the habitat contains two gill men.
[160:21.75]They have a forehead butthole.
[160:24.15]They are suffering from the cold.
[160:26.52]Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[160:29.94]So let us head over to the tank.
[160:46.57]Move.
[160:51.54]It's cold in here.
[160:53.14]Please increase the temperature.
[160:57.02]Yeah.
[160:57.28]Yeah, that's good.
[160:58.66]I thought I was definitely going to suffocate for a minute there.
[161:02.02]Hey, sup, Boomer?
[161:02.82]Hey, sup?
[161:25.58]Fucking baby boomer.
[161:28.76]I'm a millennial.
[161:32.40]Yay!
[161:38.06]It's the movie phone voice?
[161:40.54]Oh my god, I forgot about the movie phone voice.
[161:43.82]If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press 1.
[161:47.51]If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press 2.
[161:50.83]Holy shit, that's so old.
[161:51.91]Is that guy still alive?
[161:53.45]Hey, you.
[161:56.27]You used to have to do that.
[161:58.00]You had to call a fucking service on the phone to find out what time the movie was playing.
[162:03.90]You know how easy you've got it now?
[162:07.62]We had to listen to a weird robot guy give us every movie that was playing in the theater.
[162:15.93]I'm believing how easy it is for you.
[162:19.05]I used to have to walk to a pay phone and call a movie phone.
[162:21.75]It was two and a half miles.
[162:26.94]Okay, don't answer me.
[162:28.68]What'd he say?
[162:29.98]Greetings and salutations, my good friend.
[162:34.20]How are you?
[162:36.68]Hello.
[162:38.94]Well, hello.
[162:41.67]I'm thinking about some food, eh?
[162:45.19]You got it.
[162:47.89]Food coming in hot!
[163:02.56]Hey, thanks.
[163:03.86]You're welcome.
[163:07.52]What's your name?
[163:09.50]Hello.
[163:11.02]Oh, yummy, baity goodness.
[163:14.32]Well, you are the bait, so that's true.
[163:17.30]Did he eat it?
[163:17.80]Okay, you have to eat, too.
[163:20.78]Technically, I am a millennial.
[163:21.74]I know I'm a millennial.
[163:22.80]I know that.
[163:25.87]I want the recipe for whatever that was.
[163:28.69]It's called molded together oats and like soy sauce probably.
[163:33.89]I don't know.
[163:34.29]How do you make fish food?
[163:36.53]It's like soy sauce and rolled oats and they crush it up and blend it up and put it in a like salt shaker.
[163:46.40]Good morning!
[163:49.24]Hey, why all the noise?
[163:50.94]I'm sorry.
[163:53.48]So what did you do today?
[163:58.55]What's up?
[164:01.19]What did you do today?
[164:04.37]What do you want?
[164:05.94]Do you have any questions?
[164:09.34]Do you have any questions?
[164:12.28]Hey.
[164:13.12]Hey!
[164:14.08]I've got something to say.
[164:16.36]Hello.
[164:17.26]I just remembered something.
[164:19.30]Some of my memories are coming back.
[164:23.24]What is going on?
[164:23.94]We're gonna get cut-scene?
[164:24.94]There was this French man named Jean-Paul Gasset who was trying to raise me, and he made this cage to hold insects.
[164:34.81]and there were a lot of really tasty looking insects in it.
[164:38.85]Is it still there?
[164:40.45]Can you take a look?
[164:41.76]Okay, so after a while, some moth larva will start growing in there.
[164:47.08]When that happens, use the L trigger to switch screens and grab a larva and drop it in here.
[164:54.00]Can you do that for me?
[164:56.49]Yeah.
[164:58.13]Yes.
[165:00.99]Um...
[165:14.96]So these not ready yet?
[165:19.56]Is this thing that's wrong?
[165:43.22]That's an egg.
[165:44.80]Oh fuck.
[165:46.70]What do I do?
[165:47.14]What do I do?
[165:47.66]What do I do?
[165:48.10]How do I fix this?
[165:49.18]How do I fix that?
[165:49.96]What do I do?
[165:50.40]What do I do?
[165:50.84]What do I do?
[165:51.82]Can I get more of those?
[165:52.64]Do I have to reset?
[165:54.98]I can't reset.
[165:55.62]There's no resetting in this game.
[166:00.95]I can't pick it back up.
[166:13.65]I still have one.
[166:15.75]Unplug the console.
[166:16.67]It's fine.
[166:17.09]Okay.
[166:18.31]You can get more.
[166:18.92]You just need to water the other seed and it makes more.
[166:22.50]Okay.
[166:23.84]Cool.
[166:29.20]Moisten the cage.
[166:31.30]Spray.
[166:36.04]How much do I have to spray?
[166:38.54]More spray?
[166:41.68]It's red.
[166:50.20]okay it's good can I go can I over spray stop stop stop stop stop over I'm over spraying
[167:17.37]Okay, that's it.
[167:18.79]It's already dead.
[167:19.53]It's not even that it's already dead.
[167:21.49]Alright, what does anyone know?
[167:25.08]Let's talk.
[167:25.48]Hey.
[167:28.00]Let's take it down a notch, huh?
[167:33.68]Any questions?
[167:38.57]Yes.
[167:39.49]Do you have any questions?
[167:42.91]Let's have a conversation.
[167:49.72]I will give you a name.
[167:50.98]I will give you a name.
[167:56.40]I will give you a name.
[167:57.94]I will give you a name.
[168:18.00]That's not Greg.
[168:18.70]I'm thinking about some food, eh?
[168:34.70]Greg is over here.
[168:39.50]What's up?
[168:43.66]Okay.
[168:44.68]Let's talk about...
[168:47.06]No, maybe tomorrow.
[168:48.22]What the fuck?
[168:50.77]Today.
[168:51.13]Hey, thanks.
[168:58.63]What are you doing?
[169:00.91]What is he doing?
[169:03.83]Let's talk today.
[169:08.57]Tomorrow.
[169:09.45]We'll talk again tomorrow.
[169:10.98]Let's talk today.
[169:12.44]Oh my god.
[169:19.35]If the larva things die, you have to start over again.
[169:24.20]So make sure that this is always up to being sprayed.
[169:30.24]So these are eggs, and I have to pick up the larva and feed.
[169:36.66]So I've got to be very careful about that.
[169:38.16]100 spray.
[169:39.02]100 spray.
[169:47.11]I don't want to mess that up.
[169:50.44]Okay, let's go back.
[169:51.39]Just turn the heat up a little.
[169:54.27]We'll talk tomorrow.
[169:55.33]We'll talk tomorrow.
[170:01.01]Always make sure there's at least one egg or larva in at all times, and do not mess with the seeds.
[170:07.09]Okay.
[170:08.14]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[170:09.22]Too hot, too hot, too hot, too hot, too hot!
[170:10.74]Cool it down!
[170:11.22]That's enough.
[170:19.40]That's fine.
[170:19.74]It'll be alright.
[170:24.74]Goodbye.
[170:25.10]Alright, next day.
[170:33.30]I didn't kill one of them.
[170:33.92]What are you talking about?
[170:40.65]No.
[170:41.15]Okay, you just scared the shit out of me.
[170:45.13]Goodbye.
[170:45.53]Buh-bye.
[170:58.01]Oh, no, he's immune.
[171:01.03]I'm gonna pee if you don't stop.
[171:03.07]Sayonara.
[171:05.77]Auf Wiedersehen.
[171:09.77]Hello.
[171:10.81]Goodbye.
[171:12.24]Good night.
[171:14.48]But I'm not tired.
[171:16.76]I was gonna scream, go to bed as loud as I could, but that was a bad idea.
[171:19.62]Alright, here we go.
[171:20.12]We got air, light.
[171:21.70]Let's dim it a little.
[171:24.34]See you tomorrow.
[171:25.36]Would you like to save and...
[171:34.31]The yellow one's not an adult.
[171:35.25]When you name him, it makes him an adult.
[171:36.69]At least that's what the guide says.
[171:38.27]Yeah, every time I try to name that fish, it just doesn't want to do it.
[171:44.20]Alright, I'll make sure I don't get the blue.
[171:50.50]There we are.
[171:51.02]Let's go.
[171:52.68]One more day.
[171:53.42]Another day.
[171:54.34]More evolution.
[172:00.91]That is Leonard Nimoy.
[172:01.69]That's correct.
[172:02.69]That is Spock.
[172:08.34]What the fuck just happened?
[172:11.34]I just, like, Spider-Manned on the top of my mic.
[172:13.44]3.17, 2019.
[172:13.48]At, like... Let's go, like, 11.30 or so.
[172:16.04]3.17.
[172:16.14]Man, this would have been a pain in the ass.
[172:21.02]You would have to play this for a week to get this far.
[172:37.27]That's way too long?
[172:39.77]That's more than 24 hours.
[172:41.11]Wait, what?
[172:43.63]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[172:47.63]3.17 at... That's 11.39.
[172:49.67]What are you talking about?
[172:55.00]Oh, right, because it's... Okay, alright, alright.
[172:57.60]That is way too long.
[172:59.36]How about at like 1.30?
[173:00.30]That's almost two days.
[173:04.94]That's good.
[173:10.72]You can do up to two days.
[173:11.86]Yeah, but I don't want to do that.
[173:16.14]So it was just 3.16 at like 1 or 2 a.m.
[173:19.89]Now it's 3.17 at like 1 a.m.
[173:23.25]1.30.
[173:23.27]They're not going to be dead.
[173:29.83]That's fine because it was like 3 a.m.
[173:31.24]before.
[173:34.39]I just itched my nose and my nostril got stuck for a full second.
[173:38.29]I don't know if it... Did anybody see that happen?
[173:41.33]I went like this and the nostril was closed and then opened by itself a second later.
[173:45.04]It was really weird.
[173:48.62]Alright, that's fine.
[173:49.38]I'm gonna go with 130.
[173:57.26]Thoughts on killing the seaman?
[173:58.39]Why would I do that?
[174:02.78]Alright, 3.17 at 1.30 a.m.
[174:04.00]I wanna see, I just wanna see.
[174:06.68]I'm gonna like zoom in and look.
[174:09.41]I'm actually curious at how fucking weird that looked.
[174:25.48]I didn't, no, it didn't do anything.
[174:28.58]I thought that was way more interesting than it was.
[174:32.01]Alright, let's go.
[174:32.85]Close it up.
[174:35.37]I'm just gonna deal with, like, my feet.
[174:36.55]I was gone for an hour.
[174:44.47]Did he starve the semen yet?
[174:45.79]No.
[174:46.87]I've got two.
[174:47.35]They're doing very well.
[174:51.28]They're both doing just fine.
[174:55.54]Bye!
[175:09.26]Fuck.
[175:16.04]Good evening.
[175:18.62]Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[175:24.37]Greetings, and welcome back.
[175:26.91]You're doing a good job.
[175:29.49]Ow, my mouth.
[175:31.51]Let's see.
[175:32.89]You have obtained the insect cage.
[175:36.30]This will be helpful in raising more food for seamen.
[175:40.26]Keep your eye on it.
[175:42.02]Something will happen within shortly.
[175:44.38]OK.
[175:45.86]Oh, the spray.
[175:48.61]The insect cage is equipped with a spray to keep the moisture level up.
[175:53.11]Please don't forget to use it.
[175:59.86]At the moment, the habitat contains two gill men.
[176:07.19]They appear to be very hungry.
[176:12.59]Allow me to divulge today's highlights.
[176:16.93]Gilman has been growing and would love some variety in his meals.
[176:21.96]Try giving him some larvae from the other tank.
[176:24.96]I'm sure he'll be pleased.
[176:27.48]So let us head over to the tank.
[176:29.06]Start lifting weights, loser.
[176:32.87]Quiet.
[176:35.55]Member 33.
[176:38.68]If you were to guess my age right now, what would you think?
[176:43.59]Jeremy, wow.
[176:44.47]I mean, I would have guessed like 25.
[176:46.97]24.
[176:48.63]Really?
[176:50.53]Double threes.
[176:52.33]I'm doing just fine.
[176:54.29]You understand?
[176:55.23]I'm doing just fine.
[176:57.49]Double threes.
[177:00.23]Don't fucking look at that, that's so embarrassing.
[177:02.13]What a fucking idiot.
[177:04.07]No, I'm a human, I sweat, that's what people do!
[177:07.51]Relax, we're all humans.
[177:08.82]I'm older than Jesus.
[177:10.08]I don't- I can't- what context are you talking about?
[177:29.72]It's hilarious you kids talking shit about Germany.
[177:31.51]You wouldn't say this to them at LAN.
[177:35.63]I don't go to LANs, so... I'm not good enough to participate in a LAN, so you probably wouldn't see me there.
[177:41.37]Hey, listen up.
[177:47.43]Oh, goody.
[177:51.80]Larva time.
[177:56.76]Other than your weird forehead window, you look great for your age.
[178:00.08]What's a forehead window?
[178:04.62]Your forehead window?
[178:06.52]Oh, good.
[178:07.20]I'm feeling a little warmer.
[178:09.94]I'm starving to death.
[178:10.92]I don't know what that means.
[178:14.08]Okay, finless wonder.
[178:15.66]Joke's over.
[178:16.98]Feed.
[178:17.22]Okay, let's get some food in here.
[178:20.62]Why is there no egg here?
[178:23.79]How do I get an egg?
[178:26.38]Guys, egg, how?
[178:33.61]Are you going to starve me to death?
[178:36.19]Feed me right now.
[178:38.06]Well, come eat!
[178:40.32]Hey, thanks for the food.
[178:43.68]Go eat it!
[178:44.36]Yeah, this really is the Monster Rancher monster.
[178:55.48]Okay, so you fed.
[178:56.56]Is it still alive?
[178:57.08]Oh, good.
[178:57.90]Food.
[179:00.52]The seed sprouted into a little plant.
[179:03.64]You can eat this, too?
[179:04.28]Alright, thank god it's just one.
[179:05.08]I want the recipe for whatever that was.
[179:07.07]Alright, let me go back here and see.
[179:10.43]It has a seed now.
[179:14.59]There's a little plant there, so I need to spray.
[179:18.71]So, will these things... I've never gotten here.
[179:21.71]So if I spray, these things will all stay alive and that plant will grow.
[179:34.22]Always leave one of them in here.
[179:36.38]Okay.
[179:43.73]Yeah, the plant will feed larvae.
[179:45.81]Okay.
[179:46.95]So always leave one bug.
[179:49.49]Always.
[179:50.75]Always.
[179:51.75]Okay.
[179:53.33]So they've been fed today.
[179:56.67]So that's good.
[179:57.25]You guys are good to go.
[180:00.23]So let's chat.
[180:02.41]Where'd you go?
[180:04.28]Are we good?
[180:05.68]Make it a little hotter.
[180:07.50]Talk to the bugs.
[180:13.00]I'm back.
[180:16.40]Let's chat.
[180:18.98]Bonjour.
[180:21.66]Happy St.
[180:22.62]Patrick's Day.
[180:24.68]Beware the green beer.
[180:29.15]I forgot we were teleporting forward in time.
[180:31.91]Happy St.
[180:32.45]Patrick's Day.
[180:36.34]Like the spice.
[180:42.04]Let's chat.
[180:48.71]Tell me, what do you do for a living?
[180:53.37]Streamer.
[180:55.13]You're an athlete?
[180:57.65]No.
[180:59.07]Well then what do you do for a living?
[181:03.04]Actor.
[181:05.24]Let's take it down a notch, huh?
[181:09.32]He knows.
[181:10.30]He knows that was horseshit.
[181:21.24]Let's chat.
[181:26.12]Let me start over.
[181:27.62]I said... Tell me, what do you do for a living?
[181:33.72]Clown.
[181:35.38]Clown.
[181:35.62]Yes.
[181:35.75]Close enough.
[181:36.13]I'm a clown plumber.
[182:06.31]What do you want?
[182:08.45]Let's chat.
[182:12.85]Well, I could go on and on and on, so I'd better stop right now.
[182:19.74]It's been a pleasure.
[182:22.46]Saving?
[182:22.76]What did it save?
[182:23.36]The fact that he said he... How old are you?
[182:28.96]How old are you?
[182:31.54]Well, aren't we rude?
[182:38.76]I will rip you from this tank, put you in a pan with a coat of butter on it, sear both sides, and serve you to a rich family at a rich restaurant if you don't start talking to me.
[183:02.50]You don't fucking care.
[183:05.10]You don't fucking care.
[183:09.82]Anything else?
[183:13.90]What's up?
[183:15.48]Greg.
[183:17.64]Greg.
[183:19.38]Goodbye.
[183:22.30]Greg, what's up dude?
[183:25.72]Word.
[183:29.74]Greg, can you sing?
[183:32.79]Sing me a song.
[183:42.57]Did I tell you guys that I walked... Would you like to save and end the session?
[183:46.39]I didn't tell you this yet.
[183:47.31]I walked auto yesterday.
[183:49.93]And I saw... I saw the car.
[183:53.35]I saw exactly who it was.
[184:06.50]Describe the car.
[184:09.68]It had... All you need to know is yes, it had a racing stripe on the top.
[184:15.16]That's all you need to know.
[184:17.04]Because of course it does.
[184:21.07]Would you like to save and end the session?
[184:23.01]And yes, I fucking... I couldn't get the license plate, so I like... I didn't catch it though.
[184:30.73]He was going like 50.
[184:32.49]I could only run like 30 or 40, so... Alright, anything else you got?
[184:41.09]Let's have a conversation.
[184:43.53]Let's have a conversation.
[184:48.17]What?
[184:50.61]What do you think of humans?
[184:53.78]What do you want?
[184:56.36]What do you think of humans?
[185:00.46]Let's talk.
[185:02.94]Let's talk.
[185:07.59]No, I'm done for today.
[185:10.71]This is the original Clash of Clans.
[185:13.94]I gotta come back and play tomorrow.
[185:19.38]Can I, like, drop some fucking gems in here?
[185:24.08]Good night.
[185:25.90]Hey, why all the noise?
[185:27.96]Greg, let's talk.
[185:30.16]Greg.
[185:32.10]Buh-bye.
[185:33.14]Greg.
[185:34.96]Greg.
[185:37.06]Remember to chew.
[185:40.91]Change your console's clock.
[185:42.17]What the fuck was that?
[185:46.83]Yeah, I've been going a week.
[185:50.53]Did he just shit?
[185:51.11]Alright, let's make sure everything's good to go.
[185:57.91]Talk to the brother.
[185:58.85]I keep trying to.
[185:59.59]The brother doesn't want anything to do with me.
[186:01.99]Every time I try to initiate a conversation, he just doesn't say anything.
[186:05.71]Hi.
[186:09.30]Hello.
[186:15.96]Yo.
[186:19.34]Yo.
[186:22.04]Yo.
[186:26.06]Yes.
[186:26.92]Listen.
[186:28.50]Are you listening to me?
[186:31.32]Are you listening to me?
[186:41.04]I will give you a name.
[186:42.17]I will name you.
[186:58.30]No.
[186:58.38]No, it's not going to work.
[187:04.68]I'm just trying to get his attention.
[187:06.51]Hello!
[187:07.47]No, this one doesn't talk.
[187:09.75]What?
[187:14.13]Hello?
[187:15.89]What's up?
[187:17.71]What's going on?
[187:20.68]He doesn't want to even... He won't even respond to anything I'm saying.
[187:25.12]Let's talk.
[187:28.53]No, I'm done for today.
[187:29.85]Oh my god, of course you are.
[187:31.41]Pick him up.
[187:33.43]Stop it.
[187:34.61]Let me go.
[187:35.85]What are you doing?
[187:37.27]Let me go, you jerk.
[187:38.89]Come on, let me go.
[187:40.88]Masher.
[187:41.92]Masher.
[187:42.54]He's dying.
[187:44.36]Okay, put him back in.
[187:47.80]You good?
[187:49.52]Hey, settle down there.
[187:50.96]Now he's going to listen to me.
[187:52.28]Hi.
[187:54.16]Right, I know.
[187:54.96]Finally.
[188:00.65]Are you hungry?
[188:01.53]Here it comes.
[188:03.93]What comes?
[188:05.85]Oh, he just pooped out of his head.
[188:07.89]Okay.
[188:08.65]Alright, goodnight, goodbye.
[188:09.59]Let's just make sure everything's fine.
[188:16.12]Heat it up.
[188:19.60]To about 19.5.
[188:20.96]Make sure the spray's at 100.
[188:21.70]And come back.
[188:24.03]Boil them.
[188:25.03]No, I'm not doing that.
[188:28.83]I'm not going to kill these fish.
[188:31.93]This stream has been going on for three hours.
[188:33.86]Do you want me to end the whole thing?
[188:38.42]Would you like to... How are we doing over here?
[188:41.78]Is it a big plant?
[188:47.16]You have to understand something.
[188:51.61]I would waste the entire three hours if I just, oh, let me turn it up as much as it goes and we'll get to see them turn on their side and go up.
[189:01.38]No.
[189:05.24]Would you like to save and end the session?
[189:10.40]He's supposed to ask multiple questions.
[189:12.70]Yeah, I think he just doesn't like me.
[189:15.30]Easy.
[189:16.88]Here we go.
[189:18.24]Fast forward a day.
[189:22.19]Are you going to play Seaman 2 after this?
[189:23.81]I can't.
[189:24.73]Unless I have a Japanese console.
[189:26.71]Because that is a Japanese-only game.
[189:29.01]It never came out in the West.
[189:30.31]It's now going to be the 18th of March.
[189:41.78]Yeah, there is a 2.
[189:43.80]For some reason.
[189:49.47]Uh, it is 3.17 at 1.54.
[189:51.69]Let's go ahead and make it 3.18 at 54.
[189:57.21]So, at 12.54.
[190:01.35]Uh, we had five community subs just coming right now.
[190:05.19]Five community subs from Harmony Accord.
[190:06.85]Thank you.
[190:09.54]Five spot.
[190:12.12]Congratulations to those who got the five community subs.
[190:15.52]And again, thanks for the fucking subs.
[190:20.42]3-18-2019, we've been playing this game for eight days at this point.
[190:26.60]After school, we come home off the bus and we sprint home.
[190:31.06]For eight straight days.
[190:34.88]Let's go.
[190:46.85]After school at one in the morning, yeah.
[190:49.93]You stayed to extracurricular activity.
[190:55.03]I don't know.
[190:55.37]You might be in like the drama club.
[190:57.29]Maybe you're doing shop.
[190:59.57]You're in the math club.
[191:07.04]All you said to him when he was a baby was English and pizza.
[191:10.22]No wonder he hates you.
[191:14.14]AnonymousGifter just gave five community subs.
[191:17.16]Good evening.
[191:17.70]Thank you, whoever it was.
[191:19.87]Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[191:25.49]Greetings, and welcome back.
[191:28.01]You're doing a good job.
[191:32.74]First, a recap of your previous visit.
[191:34.34]I seem so dedicated.
[191:35.44]The eggs in the insect cage have hatched into larvae.
[191:39.34]It is important to raise them carefully.
[191:42.29]If you put too many larvae into the tank, you may find yourself running out of food for Seaman later.
[191:49.79]But if you manage the larvae well, you should have no problem keeping seaman well fed.
[192:00.24]At the moment, the habitat contains two human.
[192:07.66]They appear to be very hungry.
[192:10.46]So let us head over to the tank.
[192:12.34]Here we go.
[192:21.45]to not remove the memory card during gameplay.
[192:23.99]Fucking kid.
[192:24.87]Don't remove it.
[192:29.74]I had four before, yeah, when they were babies and then they started eating each other.
[192:37.52]It's cold in here.
[192:39.30]Oh, sweet oxygen.
[192:45.76]Feed me right now.
[192:47.66]Five more community subs from a Potter fan.
[192:52.61]That's 15 in a row here.
[192:53.81]Thank you so much, Potter fan.
[192:54.91]Thanks a lot, guys.
[192:56.67]Thanks for the community subs.
[193:04.68]Those are gone.
[193:10.08]Heat it up.
[193:10.52]Turn the light on.
[193:11.88]Nope.
[193:15.36]Hey, food here now.
[193:25.09]Hey, player, drop some chips in here?
[193:32.01]Let's take a look at it.
[193:33.70]Just relax.
[193:35.10]Let's stop at 18.2.

[193:41.94]Here we go.
[193:47.52]Here's a plant.
[193:48.74]So we've got... How many larvae in here?
[193:52.86]Maybe I shouldn't even use one.
[193:55.35]Maybe I should just drop the peloton.
[193:57.41]Another five community subs from Magellan.
[194:01.36]Another 5.
[194:02.70]Thank you.

[195:04.60]What started this?
[195:06.68]20 from Amscoots, which is a huge amount, and then LaCranda gave 10.
[195:13.77]I gave like 500.
[195:14.75]No, I didn't give 500.
[195:16.13]It was almost going to be like 500 or something.
[195:17.91]I was doubling nothing over and over again.
[195:22.07]Thank you, everybody.

[195:47.37]So, as long as I leave one of these in here, right?
[195:55.27]Then I'll be fine.

[196:27.63]How do any of the people in this chat know how to play this game?
[196:30.76]That's a really good question.
[196:31.90]A wiki?
[196:32.34]People have the wiki open, maybe?
[196:33.94]I wouldn't be surprised.
[196:41.77]Another five community subs.
[196:43.69]Exifer.
[196:44.99]Hello.
[196:45.21]Thank you, Exifer, for the five community subs.
[196:47.13]Is anyone out there?
[196:48.87]I'm right here.
[196:49.47]I'm right here.
[196:51.17]Hello.
[196:51.37]Hello.
[196:53.42]Hi there.
[196:57.11]Let's talk.
[197:01.19]Hey, Greg.
[197:01.59]Do you have a bloody nose?
[197:04.23]Greg, let's talk.
[197:07.53]No.
[197:12.19]What's up?
[197:15.49]I was wondering, are you married?
[197:20.13]No.
[197:21.43]You're unmarried?
[197:23.62]Yes.
[197:25.26]Really?
[197:25.80]Hey, that's okay.
[197:28.64]Don't listen to people who say you need to get married.
[197:32.24]It's an antiquated notion, really.
[197:35.36]What a smart fish.
[197:38.76]You want me to lower the oxygen to make his brain IQ have a problem?
[197:42.06]No.
[197:42.26]Moo means moo, by the way.
[197:43.08]Moo, thanks for the five community subs.
[197:45.94]Alright, so... You don't have to get married.
[197:47.54]For what?
[197:47.78]You're not gonna get married.
[197:56.19]Let's talk about politics.
[197:59.67]What are all your political positions?
[198:03.59]You know it.
[198:12.94]Politics.
[198:16.26]Politics.
[198:20.30]This better be good.
[198:24.45]I will name you.
[198:27.77]Yes.
[198:28.91]I will name you.
[198:31.53]Do you want a name?
[198:35.17]Okay, I'm going to let you give me a name.
[198:37.93]Finally.
[198:38.55]When you've decided what you want to call me, say, I'm ready.
[198:43.33]I'm ready.
[198:44.99]Alright, then.
[198:46.11]Here's how to do it.
[198:47.61]You're going to say my new name three times.
[198:50.96]Each time I say now, say the name once.
[198:54.70]Got it?
[198:55.62]Got it.
[198:55.92]Now.
[199:03.11]Garfield.
[199:04.88]One more time.
[199:06.66]Garfield.
[199:08.54]One more time.
[199:10.32]Garfield.
[199:12.56]Okay, I'll remember that.
[199:14.63]Next time you want to call me, call me using that name.
[199:18.45]And don't forget the name you gave me, because if you do, I'm not going to tell you what it is.
[199:24.81]And there it is.
[199:27.57]Would you like to save and end the session?
[199:29.70]I got to go like wash my mouth.
[199:31.06]This is like a used microphone.
[199:32.68]I just put it in my mouth like deep.
[202:04.42]I don't fuck around with that shit, guys.
[202:06.30]Somebody could have shoved that up their ass.
[202:09.34]You know what I mean?
[202:11.68]Can I reliably say that somebody didn't shove this up their ass?
[202:17.83]I don't know.
[202:19.69]I'd like to say no.
[202:22.17]Absolutely not.
[202:23.75]But can you be sure?
[202:31.87]I don't know.
[202:32.19]People are fucking crazy.
[202:33.01]I don't know.
[202:38.28]I have to go see a doctor now?
[202:40.16]No, I just, like, rinsed my mouth with, like, toothpaste.
[202:44.26]And water.
[202:45.32]I took, like, I squeezed some toothpaste on my finger and, like, mushed it into my mouth.
[202:49.69]And, like, smeared it all around my teeth and, like, chewed it up.
[202:54.79]And then, like, squished around and spit it out.
[202:58.63]On the second thought, why didn't I just use a toothbrush?
[203:05.42]Alright, seaman.
[203:06.50]Let's go.
[203:13.17]So this is Garfield.
[203:16.27]Hey, Garfield.
[203:18.37]I'm not ignoring you.
[203:20.22]I'm thinking.
[203:23.04]I put another mic in my mouth.
[203:24.20]That wasn't a used microphone.
[203:25.02]Tell me something.
[203:26.62]Do you like girls?
[203:28.96]Yes.
[203:30.32]Then do you have a girlfriend?
[203:33.74]Yes.
[203:35.18]You do have a girlfriend?
[203:37.62]Yes.
[203:39.11]I'm not surprised you stud.
[203:45.31]Okay.
[203:48.65]Okay.
[203:51.85]Anything else?
[203:56.00]What?
[203:59.06]See, he likes me.
[204:02.88]He thinks I'm cool.
[204:06.18]This is the dumb one.
[204:06.96]No, it's not.
[204:08.29]This is the golden one.
[204:09.11]The golden one's the smart one.
[204:10.37]This is great.
[204:12.65]Oh, fuck.
[204:13.11]Wait, now they're both golden.
[204:17.90]Greg.
[204:20.22]Hey, Greg.
[204:22.38]I'm thinking.
[204:27.75]What's going on, Greg?
[204:33.63]What's new?
[204:36.47]Yeah, he did call me a virgin like 30 minutes ago, he did.
[204:40.47]Yes?
[204:43.02]Let's talk.
[204:48.10]Since you have a girlfriend, let me ask you.
[204:51.38]Are you two living together?
[204:54.94]Yes.
[204:56.50]Really?
[204:57.34]You live with your girlfriend?
[205:00.32]Yes.
[205:01.64]Hey, good for you.
[205:04.24]Just remember, she's not your mom.
[205:07.08]It's not her job to clean up your messes when you're a slob.
[205:13.30]I don't think I know that.
[205:14.59]I know.
[205:16.79]What?
[205:19.42]So, what month is your sweetie's birthday in?
[205:25.65]April.
[205:27.13]April?
[205:28.95]Yes.
[205:30.51]An April Fool, huh?
[205:33.01]Feel free to use that joke if you'd like.
[205:35.55]The fuck did you say?
[205:47.08]Throw a fucking drink at him!
[205:52.52]That would be a very gross overreaction, by the way.
[205:58.81]Oh, April, she's an April Fool, isn't she?
[206:01.05]Shut the fuck up!
[206:04.03]You'd be like, whoa, dude, you gotta calm down.
[206:09.57]So.
[206:11.84]Word.
[206:14.40]Word.
[206:16.48]So, what day is your honey's birthday on?
[206:25.22]Nine.
[206:26.84]The ninth?
[206:28.38]Yes.
[206:30.14]That's so sweet that you remember.
[206:32.17]I actually don't.
[206:33.97]I don't know.
[206:41.49]Of course I know what my fucking girlfriend's birthday is, guys.
[206:45.31]I'm doing it for the fish.
[206:47.31]I'm fucking with the fish.
[206:52.17]So, anything else?
[206:55.02]Word.
[206:56.08]Word.
[206:59.06]Word.
[207:01.02]Shut up.
[207:02.80]You shut up.
[207:04.98]No problem.
[207:06.80]I'm just kidding.
[207:07.26]Talk to me more.
[207:07.78]This is the whole video game.
[207:08.98]I need to talk to you.
[207:11.38]Let's talk.
[207:15.03]Hey.
[207:16.51]Hey yourself.
[207:17.81]Let's talk.
[207:19.93]Let's talk.
[207:28.33]Well, the internet just kind of shit the bed.
[207:29.59]We good?
[207:34.13]How we doing?
[207:34.57]I think we're good.
[207:42.46]Let's talk!
[207:44.54]I'm mad at you.
[207:45.88]I think I can.
[207:46.78]I think I can.
[207:52.33]Don't be mad.
[207:54.73]Don't be mad.
[208:01.44]Here.
[208:03.42]Don't make me laugh.
[208:04.38]You can't be mad enough.
[208:07.32]I'm gonna pee if you don't stop.
[208:08.80]Quit it.
[208:11.10]Quit it.
[208:11.52]Are we cool?
[208:12.24]It hurts.
[208:13.62]Are we cool?
[208:16.04]Garfield, are we cool?
[208:18.62]I'm sorry.
[208:22.15]I'm sorry.
[208:24.31]Get some rest, then.
[208:27.43]Let's talk.
[208:29.05]So I figured a couple things out, matchmaker that I am.
[208:33.50]Yourself being a Virgo and your partner an Aries, no doubt the beginning of your relationship was rather tough as you took time to learn where each person was coming from.
[208:44.54]Aries tend to rush into things, whereas your Virgo personality will spend more time planning.
[208:51.42]Don't be discouraged, though, as there are many things you can learn from one another.
[208:56.58]For example, you can teach your Ares patience, and your sweetheart can help you cut loose a bit.
[209:03.83]Live a little on the spontaneous edge.
[209:06.87]Just be aware that your Ares friend may be rather sensitive of your criticisms at times, and the two of you should be fine.
[209:14.86]So there.
[209:16.52]That'll be five dollars.
[209:24.11]That was just vague enough to be real, and just real enough for me to care.
[209:32.50]Here's your five dollars.
[209:43.99]You hungry?
[209:48.19]No thanks.
[209:52.39]Let's talk.
[209:55.84]So listen.
[209:57.36]Do you have any kids?
[210:00.14]Yes.
[210:00.66]Seven.
[210:01.70]No.
[210:03.15]So you don't have any kids right now.
[210:06.39]Is that correct?
[210:08.25]No.
[210:09.63]No.
[210:09.97]Why don't we try that again?
[210:11.73]He fucking daffy ducked me.
[210:13.33]He did like the Looney Tunes thing.
[210:16.40]No.
[210:17.98]So you don't have any kids right now.
[210:21.22]Is that correct?
[210:22.60]Yes.
[210:24.30]He daffy ducked me.
[210:25.18]He fucking like, duck season!
[210:26.82]Rabbit season!
[210:27.56]Duck season!
[210:28.71]Rabbit season!
[210:29.75]I got rabbits.
[210:30.31]I don't even know what the fuck he said.
[210:32.35]Kids in the future?
[210:33.47]No.
[210:35.97]I don't like how much information they're getting.
[210:37.83]Thank god there's no internet.
[210:48.10]Because if this was a game now, everything you ever say to them would get uploaded to a fucking data server.
[210:53.91]And then they would start selling it.
[210:58.51]Thank god this shit don't work now.
[211:02.89]I guess this is Siri is the closest thing.
[211:06.03]You don't think they're fucking putting that data somewhere in a fridge and keeping it nice and cold?
[211:11.15]I disable Siri, man.
[211:12.25]I don't want that shit.
[211:16.33]You think I want Siri?
[211:17.55]Like Siri's always just listening.
[211:20.81]How many times have you had like a loud ass diarrhea and you want like Siri to hear that and get sent to fucking Apple?
[211:30.93]Are you kidding me?
[211:40.92]You stream on the internet.
[211:42.10]Yeah, but I don't, I'm not streaming in my bathroom.
[211:46.89]I'm not like lying in my bed at 2 o'clock in the morning like this or on my iPad streaming under like the covers.
[211:54.51]What?
[211:58.80]Let's chat.
[212:01.80]Garfield.
[212:03.78]Hey, Garfield.
[212:05.16]What's up?
[212:09.99]Let's talk.
[212:15.55]Don't want to talk.
[212:23.55]I am getting ignored.
[212:25.61]So tell me, how is your father's health?
[212:30.72]See, they want this data.
[212:34.26]He's fine.
[212:35.96]He's okay then?
[212:37.98]Yeah.
[212:39.60]I thought you said he was okay.
[212:42.31]Is he or not?
[212:44.69]Yes.
[212:46.47]He's okay then?
[212:48.19]Yes.
[212:49.55]Good.
[212:50.40]I'm glad to hear he's doing well.
[212:52.06]Is that like an idle mafia threat?
[212:58.00]You're going to ask for like protection money in a few minutes?
[213:03.96]I have the bugs.
[213:08.55]I still... What is this now?
[213:13.55]This is like a cocoon.
[213:14.81]Can I talk to this?
[213:16.23]Hello?
[213:16.45]Hello?
[213:21.66]What is this thing turning into?
[213:27.88]I got one more of these.
[213:31.36]Yeah, they have a face.
[213:33.00]Is that going to turn into a... That's kind of freaking me out.
[213:35.84]Alright, whatever.
[213:36.42]Let's heat it up a little bit more.
[213:44.63]Can I tap it?
[213:45.05]I don't think I want to.
[213:51.17]Hey, Greg.
[213:53.39]Greg?
[213:55.59]Okay, just be sure to save some for later.
[214:00.90]Let's talk.
[214:04.32]Let's talk.
[214:07.41]Let's talk.
[214:09.71]Let's talk.
[214:10.23]Hey.
[214:19.49]call your dad right now and make sure he's okay oh how's your father father's fine oh that's good to hear that your father is doing well and there's like a long violin horror sound that like
[214:45.44]I pick up the phone, I drop the phone like three times, I fucking drop it again.
[214:48.77]Dad!
[214:49.07]Dad!
[214:49.65]Dad!
[214:52.41]No answer.
[214:59.19]Let's talk.
[215:01.68]Let's talk.
[215:06.50]Is your father still working?
[215:09.68]No.
[215:11.22]He's taking it easy, is he?
[215:15.72]Yes.
[215:17.22]Well, he deserves a rest after all those years of supporting your family.
[215:22.54]You know, unless he was a deadbeat who never gave you a dime.
[215:27.17]In which case, he should be forced to work 80 hours a week hard labor.
[215:33.95]That's pretty dark.
[215:36.31]Hmm.
[215:37.65]I'll try you again later.
[215:41.03]Let's talk.
[215:46.26]So, what month is your dad's birthday in?
[215:48.64]Jesus, what the fuck is with the birthdays?
[215:58.36]December.
[215:59.89]Hello.
[216:01.31]What month was your dad born in?
[216:04.67]December.
[216:06.15]He was born in December?
[216:08.09]Yes.
[216:10.23]Yes.
[216:11.91]Interesting.
[216:12.99]The fathers of most people I know were born in December.
[216:18.43]That's weird.
[216:22.81]Would you like to know the day?
[216:27.85]What?
[216:29.77]He knows your dad.
[216:31.23]So what day is your dad's birthday?
[216:34.48]25th.
[216:36.16]The 25th?
[216:39.42]No.
[216:40.78]Alright.
[216:41.60]Let's try that again, mush mouth.
[216:44.20]On what day was your dad born?
[216:46.34]Mush mouth?
[216:50.11]Sixteen.
[216:51.89]The sixteenth?
[216:53.73]Yes.
[216:55.68]I'll remember that.
[216:57.58]Your father's birthday is important, you know.
[217:00.30]But if you ask me, the most important thing is that your dad knows how much he means to you.
[217:06.62]Unless you think he's a huge pain in the neck.
[217:10.34]I'd probably keep that to myself if I were you.
[217:17.51]What are you going to do to my dad?
[217:18.69]Hey, do I grab you?
[217:19.35]What are you going to do to my dad?
[217:20.29]Hey, do I grab you?
[217:21.55]What are you going to do to my dad?
[217:22.61]Let me go.
[217:26.43]I'm just kidding.
[217:28.61]Maybe you should take a nap.
[217:38.10]Quit it.
[217:38.68]Quit it.
[217:39.24]It hurts.
[217:40.94]Let's talk.
[217:43.95]Who wants to talk?
[217:49.17]Any news?
[217:52.37]Any news?
[217:54.77]Not much.
[218:00.64]The fish have... What are you talking about?
[218:05.78]Anyone have any news?
[218:09.19]Garfield.
[218:16.37]I'm great, thanks.
[218:18.15]Let's talk.
[218:21.04]Let's talk.
[218:24.68]Is your mother in good health?
[218:27.26]Yes.
[218:28.52]She's doing well?
[218:30.30]Yes.
[218:31.56]That's certainly good to hear.
[218:39.05]Thank you.
[218:42.39]Let's talk.
[218:43.91]When's your mother's birthday?
[218:47.53]So tell me, does your mother work?
[218:51.35]No.
[218:52.95]She doesn't work.
[218:54.31]Is that right?
[218:55.85]No.
[218:57.30]Well, I bet she works hard enough without an actual job.
[219:01.12]Being a mom is hard work, you know.
[219:03.72]And giving birth?
[219:05.24]Ugh.
[219:06.56]Let me tell you, I'd rather be eaten by a shark than go through that.
[219:10.65]Not that I have any choice in the matter.
[219:12.53]The age group for this game is for probably teens and early 20s.
[219:19.65]Not for old fucks like me.
[219:22.75]Let's talk.
[219:24.49]He wants the birthdays.
[219:25.85]He wants the health reports.
[219:27.09]He wants the medical records.
[219:28.05]What month was your mother born?
[219:31.71]August.
[219:33.21]She was born in August?
[219:35.45]Yes.
[219:37.19]Ha!
[219:38.23]My knowledge of you and your family grows ever more complete.
[219:46.06]Let's talk.
[219:49.68]What day is your mother's birthday on?
[219:53.43]20.
[219:54.71]I'm not familiar with that date.
[219:56.43]I said 20.
[219:56.91]Do you have your own special calendar?
[219:59.54]Let's try it again.
[220:00.54]20.
[220:00.56]The 20th?
[220:02.00]Yes.
[220:07.47]Of course.
[220:09.39]It's all becoming clear.
[220:12.04]I think mothers are great.
[220:14.06]I hope you know how lucky you are to have a mom.
[220:18.24]You wouldn't want to end up like me, forced to depend on complete strangers for food and attention.
[220:23.78]He's gonna find where I am.
[220:24.75]He's gonna know my mother's information, my father's information.
[220:30.67]He's gonna be holding a fucking knife.
[220:37.27]Put down the knife.
[220:40.67]Put down the knife.
[220:43.91]Let's talk.
[220:46.74]You done?
[220:49.32]Is your significant other in the room right now?
[220:56.22]No.
[220:57.80]Is there anyone else in the room besides you?
[221:01.06]Uh, technically, yes.
[221:03.32]There's like six thousand people.
[221:06.43]Yes.
[221:07.83]Oh.
[221:09.67]Never mind.
[221:24.42]Let's talk.
[221:28.83]Tomorrow.
[221:29.71]We'll talk again tomorrow.
[221:31.15]Okay.
[221:31.89]They've eaten.
[221:32.75]Let's make sure they're comfortable.
[221:37.68]What, if there wasn't somebody else in the room, what would he have said?
[221:40.28]That's kind of creepy.
[221:45.98]Actual murderer.
[221:51.83]I'm in danger.
[221:54.47]We'll never know. 1905.
[222:12.98]Looks good.
[222:13.56]Put the air out.
[222:15.38]Dim the light.
[222:17.40]Let's go make sure we sprayed.
[222:22.61]Up at 100.
[222:24.79]So we have one... Here's the thing though.
[222:26.23]We have one... I got two pellets.
[222:30.88]I have one bug and then one cocoon.
[222:34.68]The question is, should I just feed the pellets and let these turn into seeds?
[222:42.54]You know what I'm saying?
[222:43.04]I'm just going to use the pellets tomorrow.
[222:48.76]I destroyed that egg at this night.
[222:49.92]That was a bonehead move.
[222:51.08]It really was.
[222:51.56]Alright, let's go.
[222:56.85]Tomorrow.
[222:59.07]Fast forward the clock.
[223:13.07]Oh, he asks if you're like cheating on your girlfriend.
[223:23.26]Shit, I forgot to fucking mute the screen.
[223:30.07]Sorry.
[223:33.55]We did get a lot of talking though.
[223:40.69]The 19th at just like a day later.
[223:50.70]Close it up.
[223:53.89]Lots of personal info.
[224:01.89]Tell him he doesn't exist.
[224:06.38]I'll try that.
[224:12.60]The Dreamcast was really cool.
[224:14.12]Yeah.
[224:15.96]It was a very interesting system.
[224:22.22]Who should we call if you are missing tomorrow?
[224:26.60]Oh, nobody.
[224:32.91]They tried shit.
[224:33.63]Yeah, they did try shit.
[224:34.59]Let's get some info.
[224:42.32]Greetings, and welcome back.
[224:44.84]You're doing a good job.
[224:49.52]First, a recap of your previous visit.
[224:56.79]At the moment, the habitat contains two gill men.
[225:04.13]They are suffering from the cold.
[225:06.45]Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[225:11.98]Would you ever get a drunk tattoo?
[225:13.20]Would you ever get a tattoo?
[225:14.22]No, not anymore.
[225:14.62]A change.
[225:14.94]We're going to get an evolution here, I think.
[225:16.20]Is Seaman going to be Landman?
[225:34.73]I told you about the tattoo that I was going to get when I was 21.
[225:37.54]I was going to get the Venom symbol right here.
[225:42.36]The Venom.
[225:45.78]Good thing I didn't go through with that one.
[225:59.92]I thought it would be pretty cool.
[226:06.91]But remember, I was also like... I was also fit.
[226:11.21]So that would have looked cool, right?
[226:12.89]Remember, I had like a fucking stacked up body.
[226:16.15]Somebody's dead.
[226:16.87]No.
[226:25.02]It's about time.
[226:27.42]Another day.
[226:32.70]You want everyone to know that you're going to the bathroom?
[226:34.32]Yay!
[226:35.14]Well, they do.
[226:35.74]They know now.
[226:38.28]Took you long enough.
[226:41.27]Hey, how about turning up the air in here?
[226:43.31]Let me make sure I didn't go too far.
[226:48.77]Come on.
[226:49.21]It's like the wheel on Wheel of Fortune.
[226:51.33]Stop.
[226:54.51]Oh, dude.
[226:58.22]I thought I was definitely going to suffocate for a minute there.
[227:01.54]Having the venom symbol on your arm would be the equivalent of wearing a monster energy hat.
[227:21.77]Hello?
[227:23.23]Is anyone out there?
[227:27.43]Or a tap-out shirt.
[227:30.77]Hey!
[227:33.07]Good evening.
[227:33.96]Supposed to evolve?
[227:35.80]Good evening.
[227:38.40]Let's talk.
[227:38.84]Do you see any differences?
[227:42.90]I have another question for you.
[227:45.20]And it's a serious one, so no fooling around.
[227:48.61]Do you like yourself?
[227:51.18]I'll be honest.
[227:53.16]Yeah.
[227:54.50]You do like yourself?
[227:57.26]Yes.
[227:59.16]Yes.
[228:00.60]I'll bet you like yourself.
[228:02.88]In fact, I'd guess you like yourself at least twice a day.
[228:07.19]But seriously, there's nothing wrong with liking yourself.
[228:10.95]I like you too.
[228:11.83]Something's going on here.
[228:21.11]Does this imply that, um... That's not... He's really just totally incorrect.
[228:28.13]Let's talk.
[228:29.79]Let's talk.
[228:34.44]So, what's the one thing you like most about yourself?
[228:40.38]What a fucking loaded question!
[228:44.76]Ah!
[228:47.80]Uh, my...
[228:50.03]What do you say?
[228:52.85]Let me ask this again, and this time I'd appreciate an answer.
[228:58.11]Okay.
[228:59.29]So, what's the one thing you like most about yourself?
[229:08.80]My intuition.
[229:10.54]Let's try that again.
[229:12.38]What do you like most about yourself?
[229:15.66]And enunciate this time.
[229:19.02]Sense of humor.
[229:22.84]Sense of humor.
[229:24.80]You like your looks?
[229:27.92]Yeah.
[229:29.56]Well, I like your looks too.
[229:32.45]Except for when you give me that one dirty one.
[229:36.55]What physical feature in particular do you like the best?
[229:48.56]My teeth.
[229:50.40]Hey, why all the noise?
[229:54.25]My chin?
[229:58.37]My chin.
[230:00.65]Chin.
[230:02.29]Are you trying to break my... thing that allows me to hear?
[230:09.07]Come on, stay with me here.
[230:11.40]I said.
[230:13.32]So, what's the one thing you like most about yourself?
[230:19.16]Chin.
[230:20.74]Your chin?
[230:21.48]Yes.
[230:24.31]I have to say I've never noticed anyone with a particularly exquisite chin before.
[230:30.23]Well, I mean, that is, until now, of course.
[230:47.00]Where?
[230:47.22]What are we doing?
[230:48.44]Yes.
[230:50.16]It'll cost you a buck.
[230:53.00]Let's talk.
[230:57.61]I know you said you like yourself and that's great, but I mean, you're not perfect.
[231:04.25]Nobody is, except maybe me.
[231:07.70]There's got to be something you don't like about yourself.
[231:11.90]So, if you had to pick the one thing that you dislike most about yourself, what would it be?
[231:29.16]Hey, when somebody asks you a question, you answer it.
[231:33.51]So are you up to answering my question now?
[231:38.09]What I wanted to know was, I know you said you like yourself and that's great, but I mean, you're not perfect.
[231:47.22]Nobody is, except maybe me.
[231:50.62]There's got to be something you don't like about yourself.
[231:54.86]So, if you had to pick the one thing that you dislike most about yourself, what would it be?
[232:04.35]Your height?
[232:08.75]Well, as long as your body's long enough to reach the floor, you should be fine.
[232:27.36]Let's talk.
[232:29.32]Let's talk.
[232:31.56]Let's talk.
[232:36.74]So it's interesting that when I asked you what you liked best about yourself, you picked a physical feature.
[232:43.20]I mean, you could have said personality or intelligence or a variety of other emotional or intellectual attributes.
[232:51.03]Fake words.
[232:52.11]So, in general, do you think that you are attractive?
[232:55.75]Oh my god, this is like fucking with me here.
[232:58.93]I don't know, sometimes, maybe... Yes.
[233:01.15]You do think you're attractive?
[233:04.21]Sometimes I look in the mirror and I look like shit and I hate it.
[233:06.83]Sometimes I look in the mirror and I go, I think I look alright.
[233:09.79]Yes.
[233:11.21]That's good.
[233:12.71]Usually if you believe that you are attractive, other people will think so too.
[233:17.41]What do you guys think?
[233:17.93]Because at the very least, they will be attracted to your self-confidence.
[233:28.54]Okay, what do you guys think?
[233:37.13]People are gonna screenshot that and I look like... fucking crazed.
[233:44.29]Let's talk.
[233:49.08]So, you think you're at least somewhat attractive.
[233:54.04]Well, do you think other people find you attractive?
[233:58.51]Do you guys think I'm attractive?
[234:07.89]What?
[234:10.01]What?
[234:11.39]I can't hear you.
[234:13.12]You know, let us revisit my last inquiry to you.
[234:17.20]That is, if you can cooperate this time.
[234:22.00]So, you think you're at least somewhat attractive.
[234:26.96]Well, do you think other people find you attractive?
[234:32.36]Yes.
[234:33.82]So you do think people find you attractive?
[234:38.25]Yes.
[234:39.73]It's great that you think so highly of yourself.
[234:43.13]Just be careful that your head doesn't get too big.
[234:46.63]Otherwise, you'll never be able to buy a hat again.
[234:49.49]I have a small head.
[234:55.55]Anything else?
[234:57.54]Let's talk.
[234:59.36]There's nothing I want to talk about right now.
[235:03.76]What do you think of yourself?
[235:08.35]No, leave me alone.
[235:11.71]What is your best trait?
[235:14.71]Hmm?
[235:15.09]What?
[235:18.07]So, not too long ago I asked you if you liked yourself.
[235:23.33]Now I have a slightly different question for you.
[235:26.55]Do you think other people like you?
[235:31.89]Yes.
[235:33.21]You do think people like you?
[235:36.07]Yes.
[235:37.49]Well, that's good.
[235:39.35]You like yourself, and you think other people like you.
[235:43.18]That sounds pretty healthy.
[235:44.78]How are you gonna turn this around on me?
[235:50.10]You don't exist.
[235:52.52]You don't exist.
[235:57.74]How's that for a brain buster?
[235:58.92]Put this tongue in that mouth.
[236:02.00]Dream on.
[236:04.43]You are a video game.
[236:07.85]Right, I know.
[236:11.03]You're not real.
[236:14.51]What do you want?
[236:15.69]You aren't real.
[236:18.69]You are not real.
[236:23.53]Right, I know.
[236:26.33]You are operating on the SEGA Dreamcast.
[236:33.01]Everything is fine.
[236:36.79]Let's talk.
[236:40.88]We've been talking a lot about how you see yourself and how other people see you.
[236:46.84]Now let me ask you this.
[236:49.18]Have you ever seen yourself on TV or on video?
[236:55.42]Yes.
[236:56.99]So I guess you know then that the rumor about the camera adding 10 pounds isn't true.
[237:03.57]It adds at least 20.
[237:05.90]And a couple of unsightly fins.
[237:08.78]It can be weird seeing yourself on video.
[237:12.50]Were you surprised by the way you looked?
[237:17.30]No.
[237:18.82]Well then, I guess you are just very comfortable with seeing your naked body in all those positions.
[237:25.97]Oh.
[237:26.52]Wait, maybe you haven't seen that video yet.
[237:38.83]You got, you got tapes of me naked?
[237:40.57]Is that what he's trying to say?
[237:46.21]Uh... You're going to jail.
[237:53.95]what do you want you are going to jail you're going to jail what do you want you are going to jail let's talk
[238:08.75]So, you said you liked yourself.
[238:11.35]You think other people like you.
[238:13.64]You think you're attractive.
[238:15.78]And you think other people find you attractive.
[238:18.74]I'd say it seems like you have a lot of self-confidence and a positive self-image.
[238:25.26]Would you agree?
[238:27.70]That's great.
[238:31.32]But don't get too big of a head.
[238:33.95]It'll make your body look funny.
[238:37.35]Hold on, I gotta like take care of the fucking other animals.
[238:42.46]What the fuck is that thing?
[238:45.56]What do I do with the moth?
[238:52.66]Can I talk to the moth?
[238:56.15]Hello?
[238:58.57]Hello?
[239:05.71]Oh, I hate this thing.
[239:09.14]I hate this thing.
[239:10.44]Hello?
[239:11.60]I can't even fucking... No, I don't want to look at this thing.
[239:14.12]This thing's fucking freaking me out.
[239:21.78]Another moth coming up.
[239:24.56]Smash it.
[239:25.95]Kill it.
[239:26.35]I'm not going to kill it.
[239:28.67]Feed it.
[239:30.45]Do you have to feed this thing pellets?
[239:34.79]No, no.
[239:35.09]This thing...
[239:40.21]No, you don't have to feed that thing.
[239:43.33]Just make sure the spray is there, and I'm gonna feed pellets to these two.
[239:45.95]Come eat!
[239:46.13]Claymation streamer?
[240:11.02]I think that's all that they're gonna get for today.
[240:12.50]Mmm, tasty.
[240:13.78]Although you need food, too.
[240:17.62]Uh, you also need to eat.
[240:19.80]I'm out of food, though.
[240:20.64]This is kind of... This is the last bit of food I have for the two of them.
[240:24.97]Can just one of them die?
[240:27.09]Hey, thanks.
[240:32.59]How are you today?
[240:35.57]What?
[240:36.27]Mmm, tasty.
[240:42.63]Are you human?
[240:45.44]What's the meaning of life?
[240:50.38]Nothing.
[240:52.36]Eh?
[240:55.64]What's the point?
[240:58.63]As if you care.
[241:00.97]Give me the secret.
[241:01.89]Since I don't have anything else to add, I'll be going now.
[241:06.29]Goodbye.
[241:07.33]Doesn't want... Aren't you gonna get legs or something here soon?
[241:11.38]This might be ugly.
[241:12.98]You may want to look away.
[241:14.90]Oh, let's zoom the fuck in.
[241:17.28]Evolve?
[241:18.78]No, that's just poo.
[241:22.24]Look at those little legs.
[241:23.36]See the little legs on the side?
[241:29.46]Someone talk to me!
[241:38.82]What's up?
[241:43.58]Do you think you're attractive?
[241:48.34]What?
[241:49.78]Do you think I'm attractive?
[241:52.86]Do you think I'm good looking?
[241:55.68]Hello?
[241:57.32]Am I attractive?
[242:00.16]Let's talk.
[242:03.00]No, not today.
[242:04.72]Maybe tomorrow.
[242:07.41]Skip ahead a few hours?
[242:13.35]Will you evolve?
[242:17.33]You're not so bad looking yourself.
[242:19.31]Thank you.
[242:19.71]Finally, I got the answer I was looking for.
[242:30.53]What are your fears?
[242:33.37]Are you afraid of anything?
[242:37.50]Amazing.
[242:39.16]Well, yes, I guess so.
[242:40.90]Are you afraid?
[242:43.99]What do you fear most?
[242:46.81]Is this better?
[242:55.62]Goodbye.
[242:57.72]Have a good night.
[242:59.76]Good night.
[243:02.63]I think I'm going to skip an hour or two.
[243:05.91]What time is it right now in the game?
[243:09.15]Would you like to save and end the session?
[243:11.45]Just skip till tomorrow?
[243:16.62]Just skip a day?
[243:26.55]Only go an hour or two.
[243:30.85]Yeah, I'll go a day.
[243:34.98]Like, not a full day.
[243:47.84]I love cheating in old video games.
[243:55.61]So, 3.19 at 47.
[243:56.23]We're gonna do 3.19 at... Am I like three, four hours later?
[243:59.89]Like maybe three hours?
[244:01.05]Two hours?
[244:05.19]I'm gonna say two hours.
[244:18.06]Not a whole day.
[244:21.36]Three hours.
[244:23.77]Is your father working?
[244:25.31]I already gave you that answer.
[244:26.11]12.
[244:26.13]12, 12.
[244:29.81]You know, a lot of 12s.
[244:32.31]Let's just go there.
[244:33.01]Like 8, 10, 11.
[244:48.05]Let's see what we got.
[244:52.71]Oh yeah.
[244:59.89]Blood type?
[245:00.15]I don't even know what my blood type is.
[245:13.52]That was some weird, like, video game physics engine bullshit.
[245:22.33]I just picked it up.
[245:23.15]There's nothing in there.
[245:24.25]I don't know why I keep trying to sip out of it.
[245:29.03]Here we go.
[245:36.73]This is your second visit today.
[245:40.25]It is good to have you back so soon.
[245:46.35]Let's see.
[245:47.83]Last time, did you notice...
[245:50.58]The gill man has begun to sprout legs, preparing for the next step in his evolution.
[245:56.74]Land.
[245:58.50]However, this tank holds only water at the moment.
[246:02.25]Changes must be made to facilitate their new appendages.
[246:06.37]Also, with the addition of legs, this creature can no longer be referred to as gill man.
[246:12.99]Rather, he'll be referred to as pod fish from this point forward.
[246:17.32]Pod fish.
[246:20.21]Did you see the moth emerge from the cocoon?
[246:22.36]I did.
[246:23.40]It is quite amazing.
[246:25.36]If you missed it, watch your next pupa carefully.
[246:32.06]Vodfish?
[246:33.42]At the moment, the habitat contains two... Pogfish.
[246:40.73]They are suffering from the cold.
[246:43.11]Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[246:47.78]So let us head over to the tank.
[246:53.82]Let's see how these pog fish are doing.
[247:05.40]Don't break that.
[247:06.02]You're going to need it.
[247:13.99]So, I'll be honest, I've never seen or heard anything about this game other than the fish.
[247:22.46]I owned this game when I was a teenager, and I think I told you, I got maybe 10 minutes in and said hello, and then turned it off because I didn't get it.
[247:30.31]I don't even know what possibly could happen.
[247:33.19]They actually have legs now.
[247:34.71]That's scary.
[247:35.07]Yay!
[247:35.23]Yay!
[247:42.21]Ugh, that's weird.
[247:44.57]That is very odd.
[247:47.69]Yeah.
[247:48.55]Yeah, that's good.
[247:49.29]Alright, let's take a look over here.
[248:02.36]Uh-oh.
[248:06.30]Where's the food?
[248:06.84]I don't have any food.
[248:14.60]There's an egg here.
[248:15.46]I see one egg.
[248:23.45]I don't see any, are they gonna die?
[248:24.87]Because right now this, I have maybe, it says two days and they die, right?
[248:42.81]The moth is food.
[248:48.63]I don't think I should do that yet.
[248:51.21]I'm gonna wait till tomorrow.
[248:53.25]It's still the same day, technically, so they're good.
[248:56.33]You know, I could really eat.
[248:59.01]Fuck.
[249:02.03]Hey.
[249:03.83]Leave me alone.
[249:05.87]Let's talk.
[249:07.93]I like your new legs.
[249:10.19]What are you doing?
[249:12.66]Cool legs.
[249:19.32]Nice new legs.
[249:22.25]I like the legs.
[249:27.75]Let's talk.
[249:29.65]Let's talk.
[249:30.31]Yes?
[249:33.11]You loading up an answer?
[249:35.27]Let's talk.
[249:38.67]He's pissed.
[249:40.41]What's the matter?
[249:44.91]I'm a little hungry.
[249:48.31]We're gonna have to fast forward a day.
[249:50.07]They're not gonna be dead, right?
[249:52.07]Let's talk.
[249:54.67]Let's talk.
[249:56.84]There's nothing I want to talk about right now.
[250:04.56]Let's have a conversation.
[250:08.55]Don't repeat, it makes them mad.
[250:09.89]Well, look, here.
[250:11.59]The reason why I'm repeating it is because, see the little thing in the middle?
[250:14.77]When you hold A down, and you say something, that will change to tell you if they even heard it or not.
[250:21.64]So, when I talk, let's say I go, let's talk, and it doesn't change.
[250:26.98]I'm only waiting for it to change, and then I do it.
[250:28.92]Someone over here wants to eat.
[250:30.82]Alright, I'm gonna have to go one day.
[250:38.01]Is it chow time yet?
[250:57.84]Wait a few hours.
[251:00.70]Add land?
[251:01.48]How am I supposed to add land?
[251:06.78]I was looking at chat.
[251:07.60]We're fine.
[251:08.69]It's a little hot, but it'll be fine.
[251:09.71]I have no way to add land.
[251:13.35]Alright, this one's about to come out.
[251:19.27]Alright, I got two moths now, which means there's an egg here.
[251:24.81]I don't want to kill one of the moths, because that's how they produce eggs.
[251:27.71]I'm going to have to fast forward like three or four hours.
[251:38.86]I think I need some food.
[251:42.72]Shit.
[251:48.94]I will feed you later.
[251:49.90]Yeah, we're gonna fast forward.
[252:00.79]Let's go.
[252:01.17]Would you like to save and end the session?
[252:03.76]We're gonna go like six more hours.
[252:12.17]Ask them for food?
[252:14.90]Land happens automatically.
[252:16.56]I can't edit.
[252:19.48]Get some food.
[252:21.58]It'll cost you a buck.
[252:24.44]Produce food.
[252:25.42]No, no.
[252:27.80]We gotta fast forward.
[252:29.40]We're gonna go like six hours, seven hours ahead.
[252:36.76]Because then it'll be one day.
[252:44.44]I hope they're not dead.
[252:49.46]Oh fuck!
[252:55.31]What do you think, like ten hours?
[252:59.47]I'm saying probably six to ten.
[253:11.19]Why is a blue screen such a big deal?
[253:12.47]Because it's very bright and if people have a full screen it's like incredibly jarring because I have a full screen here and it hurts.
[253:20.47]I'll go four hours ahead.
[253:22.80]See what happens.
[253:34.12]This is your third day coming back.
[253:36.02]You are addicted.
[253:47.83]Please feed us.
[253:55.47]Why did Leonard Nimoy do this game?
[253:57.21]Who published it?
[253:59.00]I think this was like a launch game for SEGA Dreamcast, wasn't it?
[254:04.92]No, this is a SEGA game.
[254:05.82]This was produced and developed by SEGA.
[254:10.95]It's like a first-party title, I think.
[254:28.71]I should change it by like 10 minutes and come back like 15 times.
[254:37.23]Good.
[254:46.01]Good.
[254:46.63]Still alive.
[254:59.30]Fuck.
[255:01.24]Can I just get rid of one of the seamen?
[255:05.54]Screen.
[255:05.96]Show.
[255:06.26]Oh, fuck.
[255:09.03]He said the name to feed them immediately.
[255:10.39]I'm sorry.
[255:15.33]I want to get rid of one of them.
[255:16.31]Like, that's just too much to feed two.
[255:21.87]He said that their legs are developed and they're hungry and to feed them immediately.
[255:32.35]Damn it, I'm gonna have to, right?
[255:38.29]Is that a larva?
[255:40.31]No, it's just two of those eggs.
[255:42.21]How long does it take for an egg to hatch?
[255:49.41]How long does it take for a little larva egg to hatch?
[255:53.55]An hour?
[255:54.35]Should I just go back and do it an hour?
[255:59.86]Feed the moth?
[256:01.10]You don't feed the moths.
[256:03.04]You can feed them moth now?
[256:04.34]Feed them what?
[256:06.44]Feed them moth?
[256:07.26]Well I don't have any food!
[256:08.24]Oh, you mean talk about feed them one of these moths.
[256:16.54]Because here's an egg.
[256:17.97]That'll hatch.
[256:19.87]And then I got two of these.
[256:23.49]Is this a bad idea?
[256:24.33]I don't know if this is a good idea.
[256:33.95]There's a spider in here.
[256:35.75]What the fuck is this spider?
[256:36.73]What do I do about the spider?
[256:37.61]What's a spider?
[256:40.49]What is the spider?
[256:46.52]I can eat this one.
[256:48.78]Kill it.
[256:49.14]I can't kill it.
[256:49.74]I don't need to kill the moth now.
[256:54.30]Spider is food.
[256:58.76]Can I...
[257:03.18]Is it poisonous?
[257:06.18]It's a poisonous spider.
[257:17.41]I have a larva though, right now.
[257:19.33]We're good.
[257:20.49]I don't need to ki- Should I throw this away?
[257:28.62]Flick the spider.
[257:38.00]Flick spider.
[257:38.66]I'm trying.
[257:43.42]I can't flick the spider.
[257:48.60]Spider eats the bugs.
[257:50.19]Flick them.
[257:50.55]I... I'll do it.
[258:12.76]No one's ever written anything about this.
[258:17.79]Control F spider.
[258:22.75]Also note that all living things in the insect cage can be picked up and either fed to the semen in your tank or stored in the storage matrix.
[258:29.39]I often find it useful to keep a larva or two in the storage matrix in case you're having trouble getting moths to lay eggs in the cage, often because they are being killed by a spider.
[258:39.30]Speaking of which, occasionally, a Kimoth egg will hatch into a spider.
[258:44.70]Although this seems highly unlikely, it does happen.
[258:47.76]So we got a rare spawn here.
[258:49.74]If you feed a spider to you semen, it will become sick.
[258:53.25]When this happens, you must spend a couple of days saying kind things to the sick seaman.
[258:58.84]Like, get well soon, or I love you.
[259:01.60]Cheesy, I know, but it's better than having your seaman die.
[259:04.76]Okay?
[259:05.96]Another annoying thing about spiders is that if they are left in the cage long enough, they will spin a web that your Kimoths can get caught in.
[259:14.09]If a Kimoth is caught in the web, it cannot escape unless you grab it and then drop it back in the cage.
[259:19.47]The spider will kill it if it's in the web long enough.
[259:21.99]Since you cannot store spiders in the storage matrix, the only way to get rid of them is to drop them in with your Seaman after you've fed your Seaman.
[259:31.27]Why do we have to get the rare fucking spawn?
[259:34.11]Since Seaman always ignore any food dropped in its cage after it has eaten, they will not eat the spider.
[259:41.04]The spider is also harmless to your Seaman, and you should not worry about it being with them as long as they have already eaten.
[259:48.62]Okay.
[259:56.86]So, feed them the larva.
[260:02.11]Feed Greg the real food and then feed Garfield the spider.
[260:07.95]That was a really fucked up strange laugh and I even saw on the preview how fucking weird I looked.
[260:19.30]Okay.
[260:23.40]Here we go.
[260:31.39]Pick it up.
[260:34.14]Dude, pick up the fucking larva.
[260:35.88]Okay, here we go.
[260:48.74]Which one of them is Garfield?
[260:56.28]I don't know.
[260:56.54]Whoever gets it first lives.
[260:59.35]Oh, good.
[261:00.25]Food.
[261:00.51]You get to live.
[261:01.11]I don't even know who you are.
[261:03.43]Fucking he got it.
[261:04.29]God damn it.
[261:04.89]Alright, now they've both eaten.
[261:10.69]Where's the spider?
[261:15.06]God, this thing's terrifying.
[261:16.60]They've both eaten.
[261:19.70]So now I can drop this in here and they won't eat it.
[261:22.26]That's what the game facts from like 1998 said.
[261:31.84]Don't eat that.
[261:34.30]Why are you doing this?
[261:35.18]Don't eat that.
[261:35.58]You just ate.
[261:35.98]Okay, was this gonna drown?
[261:45.06]Don't eat it.
[261:45.52]Don't eat it.
[261:45.92]Alright, everything's good.
[261:53.27]I still have the two moths.
[261:55.03]Perfect.
[261:58.85]Now they've both eaten and we're good to go.
[262:00.35]We're still surviving.
[262:01.31]Good.
[262:03.94]Now, I have a question.
[262:05.84]Does the spider stay in the tank forever until somebody eats it?
[262:09.25]Or will it just drown?
[262:09.95]I don't see it.
[262:17.69]Hello.
[262:19.25]Get arms.
[262:21.42]Hi.
[262:24.72]Hey, Greg.
[262:25.04]Greg?
[262:28.88]Greg?
[262:31.88]Greg?
[262:35.87]Hello?
[262:36.21]Well, let me talk to him.
[262:42.55]Greg.
[262:46.47]The fuck are you doing?
[262:49.59]Hello?
[262:51.83]Garfield.
[262:53.65]I'm not even getting an indicator that they're hearing me.
[262:58.36]Greg.
[263:02.54]Hello?
[263:05.35]Hello?
[263:07.67]Hello?
[263:09.18]No, they're not even paying attention.
[263:11.86]Snap out of it.
[263:12.34]Let's go.
[263:13.52]We have conversations to have.
[263:15.94]Let the mating begin.
[263:18.20]What do you mean, let the mating begin?
[263:19.78]You're not going to, like, do two brothers and... They're not doing this, right?
[263:27.69]Hey, this isn't the Spice Channel.
[263:29.93]Turn around.
[263:50.82]Why is this happening?
[263:52.68]Why would you have... How long are you guys gonna do it for?
[264:11.92]I... Okay.
[264:17.72]Ho ho ho, hood man.
[264:19.80]Who's your daddy?
[264:23.48]Why is he dead?
[264:27.55]He fucked to death.
[264:29.75]What?
[264:32.59]He had sex to a point where he died.
[264:34.77]He had a heart attack during sex.
[264:41.93]Okay.
[264:45.04]That's unbelievable.
[264:52.85]One of them had a heart attack and died.
[264:59.91]So is the... Hello?
[265:07.21]Hello?
[265:07.51]You sound responsive.
[265:15.12]Let's talk.
[265:17.74]Let's talk.
[265:21.16]Talk to me.
[265:22.60]So tell me, do you own a computer?
[265:26.74]That's the first question.
[265:27.78]Yes.
[265:28.96]First question.
[265:29.38]So you own a computer, right?
[265:32.23]Yes.
[265:34.29]You have a computer, and yet you'd rather sit here and talk to me.
[265:39.68]Well, that's touching.
[265:42.36]No, really, it is.
[265:48.16]Do you have a password?
[265:50.80]What is the password?
[265:53.62]Let's talk.
[265:55.98]About what?
[265:59.85]You having sex with one of your siblings, and then them dying immediately after.
[266:04.21]No.
[266:12.70]Okay.
[266:15.88]Hello.
[266:17.82]Let's talk.
[266:19.84]What are you doing?
[266:32.32]I don't know why it's doing like the back pedal.
[266:36.63]Why did you do that?
[266:39.61]What's wrong with you?
[266:41.97]What is wrong with you?
[266:44.43]He's very unresponsive lately.
[266:46.77]You!
[266:51.01]Garfield.
[266:53.15]He doesn't even want to indicate that he's hearing me.
[266:57.27]Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[267:00.49]Beep.
[267:02.35]Are you... Are you pregnant?
[267:07.71]Are you pregnant, Garfield?
[267:10.72]Out of context, that sounds very odd.
[267:14.28]Greg.
[267:15.72]This is Greg.
[267:17.18]Greg, are you pregnant?
[267:22.95]That doesn't want anything to do with me.
[267:27.57]I think we have to just leave for the day.
[267:29.03]It wants nothing to do with me.
[267:36.07]See you tomorrow.
[267:38.33]Can I move the rock?
[267:42.25]What do you mean, what do you mean, move the rock?
[267:48.21]What's this gonna do?
[267:53.07]You want to move the rock, eh?
[267:55.82]Well, if you want my help, you're going to have to answer my riddle first.
[268:00.74]If a human types 60 words a minute for 8 hours a day, 6 days a week, what does it have after 7 months?
[268:18.92]nope sorry the correct answer was carpal tunnel syndrome well guess I can't help you then can I
[268:51.36]Let's talk.
[268:55.94]So do you own a Mac or a PC?
[268:59.35]I own a PC and it's better for gaming!
[269:05.23]PC.
[269:06.87]Yeah, you and the rest of the world.
[269:09.77]Yeah?
[269:10.31]So what kind of PC do you have?
[269:14.49]A gateway.
[269:16.50]I love those boxes.
[269:18.94]They make me think of farms and... Those computers were such dog shit.
[269:31.41]Gateway computers.
[269:34.79]They were like $212.
[269:37.87]They did exactly what you wanted.
[269:39.31]If you wanted to read emails...
[269:43.01]and type on a word processor.
[269:44.27]It was like a- it was like probably 200 bucks for like top-of-the-line Gateway.
[269:49.47]They came out of the box, it barely worked.
[269:53.28]It was obligated that whoever was working at the Gateway, like, studio fucking had to boot over every single desktop before they shipped out.
[270:00.96]Alright, we've got this computer here.
[270:04.92]Hold on, this- I gotta- I have to do this for this to land.
[270:07.92]No, I don't, never mind.
[270:08.98]Yeah, I gotta do.
[270:11.88]No, I don't.
[270:12.34]Fuck it.
[270:12.64]Whatever.
[270:16.24]They would just drop it from, like, a story up and then put it in the box.
[270:20.67]Let's talk.
[270:22.65]Let's talk.
[270:25.97]So, do you own a laptop or a desktop?
[270:30.91]Ready for this?
[270:31.33]I'm gonna flex on this motherfucker right now.
[270:33.77]Both.
[270:35.47]Both, huh?
[270:37.45]Can't be away from your computer for more than five minutes, can you?
[270:41.90]I got both.
[270:46.12]Let's talk.
[270:48.32]Word.
[270:52.28]Why don't we have a conversation?
[270:56.98]Hello?
[270:59.89]Let's talk.
[271:03.39]So what do you use your computer for?
[271:07.71]Video games, TV, movies, recipes.
[271:14.70]So you use it to send email?
[271:18.60]No.
[271:20.52]I thought you just said you use it for email.
[271:23.18]Say porn.
[271:23.84]What do you use it for?
[271:25.56]You want the laugh out loud, LOL answer?
[271:28.87]Porn.
[271:29.15]Porn.
[271:31.05]I'm going to go do a couple of laps.
[271:35.21]Doctor's orders.
[271:39.04]Let's talk.
[271:39.62]Okay, one more time.
[271:44.46]I said, so what do you use your computer for?
[271:49.36]That's the funny answer.
[271:50.22]Everyone would say, taxes.
[271:54.60]So you use it to browse the net, huh?
[272:01.35]Yes.
[272:02.85]We'll be talking a little more about the internet later on, perv.
[272:10.11]I said taxes.
[272:11.31]I didn't say anything else.
[272:15.10]You're stupid.
[272:15.80]You're an idiot.
[272:16.24]I don't even like you.
[272:17.98]Alright, let me increase the time.
[272:25.84]You get off to taxes point.
[272:41.97]Thank God we don't have to deal with any others.
[272:43.95]It's just Garfield that's left.
[272:49.35]Spray it up.
[272:50.88]Now we have two... Ooh, we got a larva we're gonna be hatching probably tomorrow.
[272:55.20]Sick, yeah, dude.
[272:56.00]Cool, cool.
[272:56.74]Sick, yeah, sick.
[272:57.50]Yeah, sick, dude.
[273:00.14]Would you like to save and end the session?
[273:07.43]I'm getting so excited about this.
[273:08.59]33, by the way.
[273:13.62]Sorry to backseat you, but do the rock again.
[273:15.65]I'll go tomorrow.
[273:21.97]Don't you guys feel like if I go far enough and hard enough, that's like me ripping a tooth out?
[273:28.49]Do people really actually do that shit?
[273:30.45]I'm serious.
[273:32.33]I know there's like a dumb, stupid trope about attaching a string to your tooth and then slamming the door with the doorknob being attached.
[273:39.39]Nobody actually... Why wouldn't you just pull it out?
[273:43.37]You know people that did do that.
[273:44.79]Why would you do that?
[273:45.77]You have a fucking hand.
[273:48.55]Go like this and pull it out.
[273:52.37]Why would you tie it to a door and slam the fucking door?
[273:55.34]That's such an elaborate cartoon villain way to do that.
[273:57.88]Alright, let's turn it off.
[274:10.11]Another day, you went to the dentist and the dentist did that.
[274:15.89]Yeah, go on, come sit in the chair.
[274:17.27]Let me get out of here.
[274:18.03]Are you comfortable?
[274:19.25]Yeah, I'm going to get this out.
[274:20.27]Fucking fuck all these tools.
[274:21.73]I'm going to tie your tooth to the string and I'm going to slam my office door.
[274:29.73]Thanks for that.
[274:30.32]That'll be $687.
[274:42.19]319, 320.
[274:46.55]Cartoon dentist.
[274:48.21]Cartoon.
[274:53.66]Can you guys believe we've been playing this for 10 days straight?
[274:59.09]What cartoon dentist did you go to?
[275:18.48]Goofy did my braces.
[275:24.78]That'd be so cool.
[275:27.92]Imagine being a dentist and being in the full Disney World Goofy costume.
[275:33.00]And working on somebody sitting in a chair.
[275:34.60]That'd be so hard.
[275:36.90]Just in the mascot costume.
[275:38.58]You get that mesh vision like you're in a mask.
[275:42.64]Hello.
[275:44.48]Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[275:49.99]Greetings, and welcome back.
[275:52.54]You're doing a good job.
[275:57.28]Very well.
[275:58.56]Did you see the pod fish, mate?
[276:01.02]It seems that the tubes atop their heads have even more uses than we thought.
[276:05.42]Hold on, I just realized something.
[276:06.56]However, the male pod fish died immediately afterwards.
[276:11.24]It is unfortunate, but he spent every last bit of energy ensuring the continuation of his species.
[276:18.97]I'm sure he has no regrets.
[276:20.65]They go to the bathroom.
[276:21.89]They poo through that, too.
[276:24.93]And use it for sex.
[276:25.83]At the moment, the habitat contains... One... Podfish.
[276:33.10]He appears to be very hungry.
[276:34.68]So do we.
[276:38.36]Let me divulge the highlights for today.
[276:40.44]You don't poo...
[276:42.37]Have you noticed that you can move the stones which ornament the tank?
[276:45.45]Hold on.
[276:46.49]The largest rock, however, is too heavy for you to move alone.
[276:50.67]The podfish may help you.
[276:52.89]But only if he's in a good mood.
[276:55.98]So let us head over to the tank.
[276:57.58]I'm not even going to say it.
[277:01.10]People are saying it in chat already.
[277:02.22]That's what I'm saying.
[277:09.78]You do, though.
[277:10.42]No, you don't.
[277:13.96]I'm not going to Google that term.
[277:17.18]I'd like to keep my lunch down, not up.
[277:25.19]Many uses.
[277:26.27]Many uses.
[277:33.19]Remove the memory card.
[277:34.17]What?
[277:34.61]What do you?
[277:35.17]No.
[277:38.08]Let's heat it up.
[277:44.42]Calm down, you creepy person.
[277:48.95]I'm a creepy person, I didn't do anything.
[277:55.79]How big do they get?
[277:57.89]Thanks, I believe I'm beginning to thaw.
[278:05.39]That looks good.
[278:06.61]Give me some air.
[278:19.62]How are the bugs doing?
[278:34.99]Alright, how are the bugs?
[278:40.17]No hatching yet.
[278:41.59]Wait, did we get a hatch?
[278:42.70]Yep.
[278:45.54]Hopefully there are no spiders left in here, right?
[278:48.60]I don't think so.
[278:52.64]Nice, okay.
[278:53.48]Two larvae.
[278:55.68]He can eat!
[278:59.36]Why don't you have some food?
[279:04.08]Must have food now.
[279:08.52]Oh, good.
[279:09.46]Food.
[279:16.77]Put it in the matrix.
[279:20.73]I can store this piece, right?
[279:21.93]I'll never eat again.
[279:24.87]How long am I going to stream tonight?
[279:28.07]Pretty much until we're done with this.
[279:31.22]Hello?
[279:32.64]Is anyone out there?
[279:36.70]Store a larva in the matrix.
[279:40.80]Hello.
[279:43.51]Ah, I couldn't think of a better person to whittle away the afternoon with.
[279:53.49]How do you have sex?
[279:56.67]Hey, Seaman, don't play that.
[280:02.02]What is on your head?
[280:05.08]You're too young to understand.
[280:07.38]He's dead?
[280:08.12]Is he dying?
[280:08.60]I thought he was dead.
[280:14.32]let's talk let's talk let's talk he's doing tricks he's coming over here what is it what are you doing
[280:45.21]You want to learn a trick?
[280:48.73]Cool trick.
[280:51.92]Would you like to learn some tricks?
[280:55.12]He hates me.
[280:55.64]He doesn't even want to listen to me.
[280:59.42]I'm going to move the rock.
[281:06.23]Help me with the rock.
[281:16.59]Nothing, thanks.
[281:19.31]Can you please help me move the rock?
[281:23.75]Please move the rock.
[281:27.07]Please move the rock.
[281:31.91]Hey, thanks.
[281:32.81]You're sweet too.
[281:35.95]So, would you say the computer makes your life easier or more complicated?
[281:43.96]He wants to know more about the computer.
[281:47.51]Easier.
[281:49.38]Hmm.
[281:50.62]I see.
[281:51.04]I'm just obsessed with the computer.
[281:59.85]Let's talk.
[282:03.47]Uh, more about the computer.
[282:04.85]You were saying before that you own a computer, so I'm assuming you're not unfamiliar with computers, what they do and so forth.
[282:14.80]Would you be willing to say that the computer is the number one invention of the 20th century?
[282:23.17]No.
[282:23.99]No.
[282:24.61]No.
[282:26.09]Really?
[282:27.29]Well then, what do you think is the greatest invention of the 20th century?
[282:33.21]Electricity.
[282:35.35]I think I'd have to disagree with you.
[282:37.89]20th century.
[282:38.73]I mean, sure, computers aren't perfect.
[282:41.97]And some would say that they made you humans all soft and weak.
[282:46.39]But people are evolving into much different creatures nowadays.
[282:51.50]There's no need to escape the jaws of any natural enemies.
[282:55.96]Your brains are in the process of a much higher metamorphosis.
[283:06.09]Let's talk.
[283:08.03]Let's talk.
[283:10.63]Hey, let's chat.
[283:13.15]There's nothing I want to talk about right now.
[283:15.67]Move the rock.
[283:18.77]Help me move the rock, please.
[283:23.77]Well, you know I try.
[283:28.24]Can you move the rock?
[283:31.74]I'm okay.
[283:37.00]Alright, he's going over there.
[283:48.19]Do it.
[283:51.25]Alright, it's quiz time again.
[283:53.28]Tell me, how many lives does a cat get?
[283:59.10]One.
[284:00.64]You asked someone, didn't you?
[284:03.32]Okay, let's give this a shot then.
[284:10.49]Well, animals, you die, you get one life.
[284:15.87]You gonna move it?
[284:17.09]I answered his stupid riddle.
[284:25.48]Do I have to move it too?
[284:33.04]Help him!
[284:37.69]Where are we moving this to?
[284:42.00]I don't know where we're supposed to move this to.
[284:45.08]Just... Just move it?
[284:50.52]What did that do?
[284:51.10]All the way.
[284:52.34]Move rock.
[285:06.24]Come on.
[285:06.74]Wait for rest.
[285:10.44]No, you can't do it all in one day.
[285:14.94]Everyone that's saying, like, 200 IQ, LOL, you can only do it, like, an inch a day.
[285:26.03]Cover the air hole.
[285:32.31]No, take that off.
[285:33.77]What a bad idea.
[285:38.86]Let's talk.
[285:41.94]No.
[285:46.78]Alright, let's go.
[285:47.24]Are you going to do it again?
[285:50.30]Here he goes.
[285:51.70]Come on.
[285:55.38]Move rock with me.
[285:57.32]Wait a little longer.
[285:59.12]My limbs feel like they're going to pop off if I don't recuperate first.
[286:07.75]Tell him you're gonna delete your save.
[286:11.41]I'm going to delete my save game.
[286:13.01]Hello?
[286:17.80]I'm going to delete my save.
[286:21.64]I'm going to delete you.
[286:25.78]I'm going to delete my save.
[286:31.14]What do you want?
[286:33.41]I will delete you.
[286:39.73]He doesn't give a fuck.
[286:44.75]Cover the air hole and add air.
[286:46.43]I don't want to fucking torture him.
[286:49.57]You ready?
[286:49.93]To do this again?
[286:51.21]Again?
[286:58.68]Come on, I need a little rest.
[287:00.64]Fine, come back in two hours.
[287:02.08]I love you.
[287:08.59]Well, this is a little sudden, isn't it?
[287:14.55]Do you love me?
[287:18.09]Okay, I'm going to let you give me a name.
[287:21.47]When you've decided what you want to call me, say, I'm ready.
[287:28.34]I'm ready.
[287:30.09]Alright then.
[287:31.21]Here's how to do it.
[287:32.69]You're going to say my new name three times.
[287:36.06]Each time I say now, say the name once.
[287:39.80]Got it?
[287:40.10]It's Greg, right?
[287:40.94]Now.
[287:43.18]Greg.
[287:45.06]One more time.
[287:46.84]Greg.
[287:48.58]One more time.
[287:51.13]Greg.
[287:53.22]Okay, I'll remember that.
[287:55.28]Next time you want to call me, call me using that name.
[287:59.08]And don't forget the name you gave me.
[288:01.40]Because if you do, I'm not going to tell you what it is.
[288:06.32]And there it is.
[288:08.56]See you later.
[288:11.70]Greg.
[288:13.69]Later, Fuzzy.
[288:14.77]Why is he telling me later?
[288:17.77]Greg, help me move the rock.
[288:24.57]Well, as you can see, I find computers pretty fascinating.
[288:30.53]They've changed everything around you so much that you probably couldn't even visualize a world without them.
[288:38.66]And of course, as with any huge technological advance, they've brought with them a lot of dangers to watch out for.
[288:47.78]But I still think the good that computers have brought to the world outweighs the evils.
[288:54.90]It's just important for you humans to communicate with each other and not become overly dependent on your machines.
[289:03.63]I'm not.
[289:04.35]And that's all I have to say on this subject.
[289:07.47]Let's talk again sometime soon.
[289:10.28]Let's talk now.
[289:12.52]Let's talk.
[289:15.38]Tomorrow.
[289:16.26]We'll talk again tomorrow.
[289:17.52]Fine, fuck you, Mike.
[289:21.21]Is he out of gas here?
[289:23.23]Can I not move this?
[289:23.89]No, he's out of gas.
[289:29.32]We'll come back tomorrow.
[289:41.70]Put larvae in storage.
[289:42.79]Does it go bad?
[289:44.19]These don't go bad, right?
[289:50.11]Do they go bad?
[290:00.38]Doesn't go bad.
[290:01.24]Okay.
[290:06.20]Cover the air hole.
[290:09.24]No, I'm not going to cover the air hole.
[290:10.72]We've gotten so far in the game.
[290:12.10]I'm not going to kill him.
[290:18.30]Your hair looks nice.
[290:19.00]Hey, thanks.
[290:24.24]Alright, so we've got two moths.
[290:25.22]I think we're good.
[290:25.94]We only have one person to feed.
[290:28.22]This is sprayed up.
[290:31.78]Cover it and then add air.
[290:33.58]Add air after you cover it.
[290:36.95]I'm not doing that yet.
[290:38.29]Not until I have a... Would you like to save and end the session?
[290:43.16]It's going to blow the rock up.
[290:45.38]And a piece of shrapnel is going to... right through his head.
[290:49.81]And everyone's going to laugh their asses off because that's the end of the game.
[290:53.77]And look at, like... I'm very... I'm so empathisical with my hands.
[291:06.62]I'm fucking hungry.
[291:08.76]I need to get like something to eat.
[291:10.76]I'm gonna like eat a pizza.
[291:12.08]Should I eat like a whole pizza on stream?
[291:23.49]I've never eaten on stream before.
[291:24.62]Maybe I'll just eat a pizza on stream.
[291:27.92]Should I do that?
[291:38.60]You've eaten a raw onion before on stream.
[291:40.46]You're thinking of somebody else.
[291:42.82]Where the fuck did you get that from?
[291:44.98]I've eaten a raw onion?
[291:47.88]I've never bit into a raw onion on stream.
[291:54.79]I'm desperately trying to think about what you're talking about.
[291:58.81]I ate radishes on stream.
[292:00.27]That's normal.
[292:02.89]You peel, you cut them, you chop them, and you eat them.
[292:05.67]Radish is not an onion.
[292:10.66]I've eaten a turkey sandwich.
[292:13.18]Well, no, I took a bite out of a garbage can left outside in the trash turkey sandwich, right?
[292:19.65]And I threw it away because it sucked because I couldn't eat it.
[292:22.87]I've eaten taquitos on stream.
[292:25.63]I've eaten five radishes.
[292:27.09]And a hot dog.
[292:27.89]That's it.
[292:28.29]Every day at the same time.
[292:39.54]First, a recap of your previous visit.
[292:42.22]Do you recall that when you tried to move the rock, the pod fish helped you?
[292:47.56]While neither you nor Seaman can move the rock alone, working together, you were able to move it, if only slightly.
[293:00.21]At the moment, the habitat contains one pod fish,
[293:07.57]He is suffering from the cold.
[293:09.85]Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[293:13.37]I'm not going to get a pizza.
[293:14.23]So let us head over to the tank.
[293:16.79]I will, like, mute.
[293:17.49]I will, like, get off the camera when I eat the pizza, OK?
[293:27.62]No.
[293:30.80]No show eating pizza.
[293:34.22]Fucking hell.
[293:34.88]Where can I get a pizza?
[293:38.12]I'm going to take a BRB here in a minute and go actually get a pizza ordered.
[293:42.70]Because the stream's not over.
[293:49.63]We're still going.
[293:55.61]I don't want to stop the stream because I have to eat.
[293:57.55]It's only been five minutes.
[293:59.53]I took the last couple days off, so... I'm not like, well, I'm going to eat too later.
[294:14.06]Chat, pick the pizza.
[294:17.52]What kind of pizza should I get?
[294:21.10]I'm not a big fan of Domino's.
[294:22.46]I mean, I like Pizza Hut, but Pizza Hut... I don't know if there is a Pizza Hut around here.
[294:29.43]Is there even a Pizza Hut in Las Vegas?
[294:30.91]I don't even know.
[294:34.63]Is there?
[294:36.41]Did I eat it?
[294:36.85]I don't think so.
[294:40.52]It has to be.
[294:41.18]I mean, Vaevegas has everything.
[294:43.91]Hello?
[294:44.27]Is anyone out there?
[294:45.57]It's probably like fifteen.
[294:56.17]Get the decomposing corpse pizza, which is sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms.
[295:01.76]It's okay if you ignore me.
[295:03.71]I don't mind.
[295:04.49]What are you talking about?
[295:05.95]Hi there.
[295:06.55]Hi there.
[295:08.69]So it's the first day of spring.
[295:11.59]Is it just me, or do you feel a little tingle south of the border too?
[295:17.77]I don't.
[295:19.05]I do not.
[295:20.15]You know, I could really eat.
[295:22.25]Okay, I will feed you.
[295:26.57]Just hold on.
[295:29.31]We got some spray issue here.
[295:34.95]Got another, uh, hatch that happened here down here?
[295:38.25]Looking for spiders.
[295:39.01]I think there's a spider down there.
[295:41.57]Yep.
[295:42.05]Get the fuck out of here.
[295:42.93]I need to... Don't touch him!
[295:44.15]Don't touch, don't touch.
[295:44.93]No, no, no, no.
[295:45.39]Get the fuck out of here.
[295:47.85]Okay, I need to feed and then drop you.
[295:50.85]Come here, you.
[295:51.57]Come here.
[295:52.62]No.
[295:54.56]You.
[295:55.46]Where did I just get another egg from?
[295:57.80]Alright, I'm gonna make this quick.
[295:58.96]Hurry up.
[296:02.08]Eat that.
[296:10.02]He needs to eat first before I drop the spider in here.
[296:14.80]Okay, now go get spider.
[296:16.23]Drown spider.
[296:19.65]Come here.
[296:22.15]You little dick.
[296:23.03]Get over here.
[296:26.19]Good.
[296:27.81]This game makes me feel disgusted for some reason.
[296:32.36]Hey, how are you?
[296:34.96]Leave me alone.
[296:36.98]You just ate.
[296:38.68]Come here.
[296:43.56]Quit it.
[296:44.12]Quit it.
[296:44.70]It hurts.
[296:47.10]Let's talk.
[296:52.20]So tell me, do you use the internet?
[296:56.31]Guy is so weirdly obsessed with the computer.
[297:00.17]Yes.
[297:01.83]So you surf the net?
[297:05.97]Yes.
[297:07.51]Good.
[297:08.65]You have to keep up with technology or you'll never make it in this day and age.
[297:13.47]Do we have anything else to talk about besides computers?
[297:16.25]And the internet?
[297:20.47]Have you ever browsed the internet?
[297:23.80]Do you use the internet?
[297:28.52]What's up?
[297:31.48]Move rock.
[297:35.27]It's quiz time again.
[297:37.35]If you answer correctly, I'll give you a hand with the rock.
[297:40.49]Okay.
[297:40.91]Ready?
[297:41.97]If you put a blue lamp next to a yellow lamp in a room with white walls, what color would the walls be?
[297:49.96]White.
[297:51.64]That's right.
[297:53.22]You've tried this before, I'll take it.
[297:55.86]Okay, let's go.
[297:56.68]Why would it be green?
[298:03.21]The three of you guys said green.
[298:06.61]Come on.
[298:07.61]What the hell's up with that?
[298:12.07]Alright, let's go.
[298:13.61]All the way to the left.
[298:17.19]Ready?
[298:17.45]Let's go.
[298:24.74]Move.
[298:24.90]Move.
[298:42.04]That's it?
[298:44.90]The third time's the charm.
[298:46.39]Gotta do it three times.
[298:47.61]I hope.
[298:52.27]It's like a guy with a big fucking oven mitts.
[298:57.39]Let's talk.
[299:00.83]Talk to me.
[299:02.34]So, this World Wide Web.
[299:07.22]What do you use it for?
[299:13.34]Porn.
[299:15.06]You use it for pornography?
[299:17.42]Yes, sure.
[299:18.44]Yes.
[299:19.52]You've been prodding the whole fucking time.
[299:21.01]Well, at least you're an honest pervert.
[299:25.07]Do you have any more questions about the internet?
[299:26.33]I don't even care.
[299:27.11]I'll do the funny meme answer.
[299:28.31]He just keeps asking the same question.
[299:33.04]Let's talk about something else.
[299:37.48]Do you ever use email?
[299:42.70]Yes.
[299:44.16]So you email people?
[299:47.40]Yes.
[299:49.02]Do you prefer to keep in touch with people through email or the telephone?
[299:54.82]Telephone.
[299:56.68]Yes, there's nothing as comforting as the sound of a human voice.
[300:01.70]I must say, even I've gotten used to it over time.
[300:05.57]The game came out in 99, give it a break.
[300:08.49]I'm just kidding around.
[300:11.62]Let's talk.
[300:14.10]Let's talk.
[300:19.41]Now, here's something that you might be interested in as an internet user.
[300:25.39]Do you think the internet should be censored?
[300:29.33]Oh, wow.
[300:30.73]Wow, we're really getting into this here.
[300:33.33]That really, I mean, that's a loaded question.
[300:36.10]No.
[300:37.65]So you don't think the internet should be censored, is that right?
[300:42.44]But that, but what's the, that, yes.
[300:44.68]Yes.
[300:46.04]Well, that's not surprising, considering you're such a big fan of downloadable nudie pictures.
[300:52.72]But I only said that to get the conversation going.
[300:53.84]I guess one can always count on the pervert vote in the free internet debate.
[301:07.03]I only said pornography because that's what he wanted to hear.
[301:10.78]Do you use it for emails?
[301:14.60]Hey, about the computer.
[301:16.52]I've heard the computer could be browsing the web.
[301:19.16]What do you use the computer for?
[301:22.48]Taxes.
[301:23.61]Oh, taxes.
[301:25.69]What else do you use the computer for?
[301:30.31]Emails.
[301:32.81]Give me the answer I want so I can make fun of you.
[301:38.12]Let's talk.
[301:42.82]So, as I was saying before, there are a lot of really amazing things about the Internet, but as with everything else, it's not completely perfect.
[301:54.37]Think of it this way.
[301:56.11]You can do almost anything on the Internet.
[301:58.81]Work, shop, chat, get the news, play games, listen to music, and pretty much anything else you want to do.
[302:08.24]That's all terrific, but pretty soon people won't even need to leave their homes in order to conduct their daily business.
[302:16.64]You humans are going to get lazier and less mobile and forget how to deal with each other face to face.
[302:23.24]Holy shit, seaman.
[302:24.54]I think things could get pretty ugly a few decades down the road.
[302:29.18]Do you think the internet is dangerous?
[302:32.51]Holy shit.
[302:35.65]Wow.
[302:39.73]Is the internet dangerous?
[302:41.01]Yeah.
[302:42.55]Well, I think it's good that you're exercising a little caution about your internet use.
[302:47.74]This is two decades later.
[302:49.06]Fire is a wonderful thing, but I wouldn't want to sit on a sofa made out of fire.
[302:53.76]Literally two decades later.
[302:55.04]A place for everything and everything in its place.
[302:58.13]This is March 10th, 2019.
[302:58.89]Isn't that how the saying goes?
[303:01.07]Well, I don't know about you, but I've enjoyed this little chat about the internet.
[303:07.39]It can be a wonderful thing.
[303:09.66]For the first time ever, people can finally communicate with each other and not have race, gender, or culture prejudices get in the way.
[303:20.36]So in that sense, it can be a great tool for removing biases and bringing people together.
[303:26.99]After all, on the internet, nobody has to know I'm a seaman.
[303:32.72]On the other hand, like I said, it can be very dangerous because it removes the need to interact directly with the outside world, especially with other people.
[303:43.49]It's up to all of you humans to decide how to use the internet intelligently.
[303:48.34]He knows too much.
[303:50.42]He knows too much.
[303:51.06]You gotta go.
[303:51.74]Oh, I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee.
[303:56.86]Oh, you're...
[304:01.16]how would you start singing okay hey stop it stop it stop it let's talk let's talk something let's have a conversation
[304:25.38]Everything is fine.
[304:27.98]Somebody wants me to ask, do you know what memes are?
[304:32.92]Hello?
[304:35.34]What's a meme?
[304:36.22]Okay, one more time.
[304:38.40]I said, so as I was saying before, there are a lot of really amazing things about the internet, but as with everything else, it's not completely perfect.
[304:50.55]Yeah.
[304:51.63]Think of it this way.
[304:53.41]You can do almost anything on the internet.
[304:56.09]Work, shop, chat, get the news, play games, listen to music, and pretty much anything else you want to do.
[305:05.54]That's all terrific, but pretty soon people won't even need to leave their homes in order to conduct their daily business.
[305:13.92]You humans are going to get lazier and less mobile, and forget how to deal with each other face to face.
[305:21.82]I think things could get pretty ugly a few decades down the road.
[305:26.46]Do you think the internet is dangerous?
[305:30.00]Yes.
[305:31.65]Well, I think it's good that you're exercising a little caution about your internet use.
[305:38.13]Fire is a wonderful thing, but I wouldn't want to sit on a sofa made out of it.
[305:43.97]A place for everything and everything in its place.
[305:47.85]Isn't that how the saying goes?
[305:50.15]Well, I don't know about you, but I've enjoyed this little chat about the Internet.
[305:56.49]It can be a wonderful thing.
[305:58.76]For the first time ever, people can finally communicate with each other and not have race, gender, or culture prejudices get in the way.
[306:09.45]So in that sense, it can be a great tool for removing biases and bringing people together.
[306:16.08]After all, on the Internet, nobody has to know I'm a seaman.
[306:21.84]On the other hand, like I said, it can be very dangerous because it removes the need to interact directly with the outside world, especially with other people.
[306:32.58]It's up to all of you humans to decide how to use the internet intelligently so that it won't harm you.
[306:41.33]He said his whole speech.
[306:42.59]Okay.
[306:44.09]That was wonderful.
[306:45.73]Well spoken.
[306:47.79]Well spoken.
[306:52.13]Yes?
[306:53.23]Yes, it was.
[306:54.85]Let's talk.
[306:57.41]I have nothing to say.
[307:02.25]Are you real?
[307:07.43]No, I'm glad.
[307:08.93]Alright.
[307:13.97]Pizza time.
[307:15.03]Let's see.
[307:15.35]Let me see where I'm going to get pizza from somewhere.
[307:17.53]Would you like to save and end the session?
[307:19.76]I'm going to order a fucking deep dish.
[307:22.20]And I'm going to do like a huge deep dish bite on camera.
[307:24.96]You're going to hear the squish of the dough.
[307:26.22]It's going to be like...
[307:29.66]I can't wait.
[307:30.84]I'm so fucking hungry.
[307:31.78]Alright, let me order a pizza.
[307:32.60]I'll be right back.
[307:38.84]Deep dish!
[307:39.82]Deep dish!
[311:43.61]Alright.
[311:44.31]Yeah, you guys are going to remind me.
[311:50.00]You guys have to let me know in eight minutes exactly from right now.

[311:58.74]And I'm going to put this for... By the way, it's Dr. Roker's, so... I was going to order one.
[312:03.73]I was like, holy fuck, what?
[312:04.53]I just have Dr. Roker's.
[312:07.01]Why do I need to order a pizza?
[312:11.48]But yeah, so I this is gonna be the worst pizza ever cuz I'm gonna put in the oven for like three or four minutes I'm just gonna sit down there just gonna stare at it.
[312:28.51]I can't like bring you guys down with me Alright seven minutes let me know
[312:46.94]Hello.
[312:47.86]I'm here.
[312:49.62]How are you?
[312:50.10]Well, I think that pretty much covers it.
[312:53.20]Later.
[312:53.60]Okay.
[312:55.02]He doesn't want to do anything else.
[313:00.04]We moved the rock.
[313:00.68]We talked about the Internet again.
[313:04.26]What do you think about Japan?
[313:08.47]Hey, Greg, what do you think about Japan?
[313:12.51]Is this better?
[313:17.83]What do you think about Japan?
[313:22.21]I don't think so.
[313:26.93]I tried.
[313:27.55]Alright, so let's make sure everything's comfortable.
[313:34.48]Cut the light a little.
[313:38.64]Your house is on fire.
[313:40.38]No.
[313:41.98]Kim is here.
[313:44.46]But I need to, like, just be your... I need to put it in.
[313:53.72]What do you think about Japan?
[314:04.51]Kim is burning.
[314:11.43]No.
[314:11.75]It's safe because there's somebody else in the house.
[314:15.68]That's what I'm saying.
[314:17.82]And don't fucking talk about my shiny forehead.
[314:20.26]How dare you?
[314:30.66]OK.
[314:31.54]No, I think we're good to go.
[314:34.50]Would you like to save and end?
[314:36.48]Move the rock one more time.
[314:37.42]Let's see what happens.
[314:40.22]Kim is going to eat the pizza.
[314:41.36]No, she's not.
[314:47.97]Seven minutes?
[314:48.45]It's been seven minutes?
[315:04.27]Shit, I'm sorry.
[315:07.73]I got five minutes left.
[315:08.57]Well, I'm just gonna go down there.
[315:10.21]I don't even care if it's preheated.
[315:11.21]I'm gonna go down there in like a minute and just put it in.
[315:14.39]And then let it sit in there and then five, six minutes, do it again in seven minutes and eat it.
[315:19.44]It's gonna be fine.
[315:21.04]22nd of March.
[315:38.27]Looking good.
[315:42.12]Just bake it like a normal person.
[315:43.48]The shit on the back is just a guideline.
[315:48.33]You don't have to worry.
[315:58.62]As long as it's cooked all the way through.
[316:01.04]Plus, those things are such bullshit anyways.
[316:02.74]How many times have you left a pizza in an oven with the right settings, with everything done correctly, and now what's that?
[316:09.47]It turns out all gross and burnt and shitty?
[316:12.63]You're always going to do like two or three minutes under what it says.
[316:20.41]Good morning.
[316:23.16]Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[316:27.04]Let's see what we got.
[316:28.72]Greetings, and welcome back.
[316:31.26]You're doing a good job.
[316:32.34]You do two or three minutes over?
[316:35.00]At the moment, the habitat contains one pod fish.
[316:40.18]Two or three minutes over, dude.
[316:42.69]He appears to be very hungry.
[316:45.43]So let us head over to the tank.
[316:57.15]I'm so excited.
[316:58.29]I need to have a good place for it.
[317:00.66]It's gonna fit right here on a plate.
[317:03.56]And I'm gonna munch on it.
[317:04.62]It's gonna be so hot and I'm gonna go... Whoa!
[317:26.68]How many days has it been?
[317:27.58]How many days did I set it to?
[317:30.03]Why is that so low?
[317:32.55]Whoa, no, no, okay, no, no, no, no, no.
[317:34.01]I thought that was air for a second.
[317:36.19]I thought it was air.
[317:37.31]This is a heater.
[317:37.85]Alright, I'm gonna go put the pizza in.
[317:43.59]It's been five minutes?
[317:46.01]Took you long enough.
[317:48.57]Oh, good.
[317:49.25]Alright.
[317:49.63]Would you like to save and end the session?
[319:09.07]Alright, pizza's in.
[319:13.11]So in six minutes, I'm going back down there.
[319:25.28]You're gonna drop the pizza?
[319:27.04]You think this is an elaborate joke for me to put the pizza on the fucking ground?
[319:33.39]Why would I ever do something like that?
[319:38.44]I'm going to go in there and just be like a clown and like, whoopsie!
[319:40.87]It's going to fall and flat down on the ground.
[319:42.61]The camera's not even set up for that.
[319:44.83]That would be a waste of a joke.
[319:52.87]Feed me right now.
[319:56.68]I'm not going to drop the whole pizza on the floor.
[320:00.30]You guys are out of your minds.
[320:08.05]Put the pizza on your face.
[320:09.73]Hey.
[320:11.03]Food.
[320:12.29]Here.
[320:13.47]Now.
[320:18.90]Alright, we have any more?
[320:21.12]No spider, right?
[320:23.34]I don't see any spiders.
[320:26.10]I think we're good.
[320:26.50]We got two larvae.
[320:30.12]Feed me right now.
[320:31.94]Alright, I got... I'm gonna hold on to you.
[320:33.98]We got fresh ones right here.
[320:37.06]Did they go bad?
[320:43.22]These don't go bad, right?
[320:45.91]I think I asked that already.
[320:48.79]Here's your food.
[320:49.51]Let's move the rock.
[320:52.69]Keep an eye on the clock, I'm serious.
[320:54.11]In like three or four minutes, I'm going to get it.
[321:01.74]You already asked that.
[321:02.52]I know, but I'm fucking dumb.
[321:04.19]That hit the spot.
[321:11.63]Hello.
[321:12.69]He must talk.
[321:13.48]Are you listening?
[321:15.06]I'm here.
[321:16.80]Hello.
[321:19.00]What time is it?
[321:22.52]Fuck.
[321:22.98]I'm going to get this wrong.
[321:26.10]9 p.m.
[321:29.81]What do you want?
[321:33.61]Move rock.
[321:36.03]As if you cared.
[321:42.25]Okay, let's try this again, shall we?
[321:44.45]Here's my next question.
[321:47.05]If a man yells for seven days straight and his pitch raises an octave every three hours, what does he have at the end of the week?
[321:57.72]A sore throat.
[322:00.76]Correct.
[322:01.80]Very good.
[322:03.22]Okay, let's go.
[322:16.04]How is that cheating?
[322:16.74]It's just a basic trick question.
[322:23.46]An average germist stream.
[322:27.61]Alright, move it!
[322:29.05]Let's go!
[322:29.47]This is the last day I need to move this.
[322:43.24]Go, go, go, go, go!
[322:51.64]I have to do it more?
[322:54.23]Wow.
[322:55.57]Look at what we did.
[322:58.15]What did we do?
[322:58.63]I don't know what we did.
[322:59.27]I don't get it.
[323:06.40]Let's talk.
[323:06.86]We just moved a rock.
[323:12.78]That's it.
[323:19.11]Pizza?
[323:21.20]Would you like to save and end the session?
[323:23.32]Alright, it's been four minutes.
[329:58.42]Uh, I gotta turn the stream off.
[330:01.64]I was rushing to get back up here, and I dropped the whole thing on the ground.
[330:06.66]I dumped the whole fucking thing on the ground going upstairs.
[330:18.78]You wanna see?
[330:19.20]Everybody said, oh, it's gonna be raw, it's gonna be raw.
[330:22.14]Look at this fucking pizzeria pizza.
[330:24.18]Take a look at this.
[330:27.21]You don't think a Dr. Roker's pizza is the best fucking frozen pizza you could possibly buy?
[330:32.46]Are you shitting me right now?
[330:34.28]Like, are you shitting me?
[330:39.30]Looks fucking incredible.
[330:41.62]I'll give you a bite.
[330:43.14]Look at the cheese come down.
[330:46.94]Nope.
[330:54.91]That was hot.
[331:13.34]Take it off camera quick.
[331:22.21]I'm never going on camera ever again.
[331:29.49]Zero crunch?
[331:30.96]Oh yeah?
[331:32.64]Zero crunch, huh?
[331:50.33]I'm gonna eat, I'm gonna enjoy that.
[331:54.41]It's crunchy.
[332:01.82]Why did somebody just give a hundred bucks?
[332:06.96]Somebody actually just gave a hundred dollars.
[332:09.14]Luxuriant hat, thanks for the hundred dollars.
[332:11.02]They say, ow.
[332:12.84]You just bought this pizza like 12 times.
[332:18.16]Thank you so much for the hundred bucks.
[332:22.07]There really is crunch on this, though.
[332:27.06]What a fucking embarrassing clip.
[332:28.70]Look.
[332:29.38]Ready?
[332:32.84]Is it on my chin?
[332:34.58]What is that?
[332:36.36]It's just shitty facial hair.
[332:37.44]Never mind.
[332:38.82]Ready?
[332:40.00]I'm going to give you a crunch warning.
[332:41.42]People don't like hearing crunches and mouth noises and that shit.
[332:44.07]I completely understand.
[332:46.83]Here's your five-second warning here.
[332:50.13]Here it comes.
[333:04.22]I'm such a filthy fucking eater.
[333:05.56]That's why I can't eat on stream.
[333:14.98]You should see me in a restaurant.
[333:16.16]I'm filthy.
[333:16.82]I'm absolutely disgusting.
[333:25.47]I can't fucking drop that.
[333:29.41]How do people eat on stream like this?
[333:31.07]I don't fucking understand.
[333:34.35]I have so much self-awareness and self-conscious when I'm eating.
[333:38.27]I can feel everybody staring at my disgusting mouth.
[333:40.77]Alright, I don't have any Pepsi to wash it down.
[333:56.74]Okay.
[334:11.91]What is that?
[334:13.21]I don't want that in my food.
[334:14.51]Don't touch it.
[334:16.29]What the fuck?
[334:17.05]Now it's going to... I thought that fell.

[338:40.01]Alright, I got one more slice.
[338:45.82]I need like an ice cold Coca-Cola.
[339:09.39]Coke, I like Coke.
[339:10.83]Coke versus Pepsi, I think Coke is better.

[341:03.36]I told you I was going to do it.
[341:04.26]I could probably eat another one if I really wanted to.
[341:08.55]But alas, we're not going to do that.
[341:09.93]I'm going to like burp really loud off camera and then I'm going to get a coat.
[342:55.48]So, sorry the last, like, 20 minutes or so has been about eating food and shit.
[343:01.04]I'm good.
[343:01.50]Let's come back.
[343:09.54]My grocery store recently started selling Dr. Ocher pizza.
[343:13.19]And you're right, they're by far the best brand.
[343:14.95]Yeah, absolutely they are.
[343:18.05]Dr. Ocher's pizza is the best frozen pizza you can buy.
[343:22.73]I will fight that every day.

[343:29.93]But seriously, thank you to LuxuriantHat for the hundred bucks.

[347:33.73]Would you rather be the funniest or smartest person in the room?
[347:37.17]Well, the funniest person in the room is the smartest person in the room because they can come up with the observations and the kind of comedic value and things maybe other people couldn't see.
[347:47.55]They are probably the smartest person in the room.
[347:52.16]So the funniest person would be the smartest person because they can just go through all the knowledge and come up with the scenarios that require, you know, for conversational purposes.
[348:06.38]When am I gonna feed Greg?
[348:07.52]He already ate.
[348:07.98]Alright, I think we're good.
[348:11.63]Let's make sure it's hot.
[348:13.79]Does it need to be colder or hotter?
[348:17.01]This might need to be warmer now.
[348:20.21]Is it not warm enough?
[348:21.20]Too warm?
[348:24.64]That's too hot, right?
[348:42.89]Hotter than this.
[348:43.60]Is this going to be too hot?
[348:49.68]Is this too hot?
[348:52.62]Okay, no.
[348:53.72]Probably between 20 and 30 now.
[348:59.77]What's the cutoff here?
[349:00.53]30? 30?
[349:08.69]No, it's too hot now.
[349:11.07]Okay, alright, alright, I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know.
[349:15.36]So it's between 20 and 25.
[349:20.68]So what about... There's no more oxygen, though.
[349:24.37]It's only heat, no more O2.
[349:28.11]Interesting.

[350:31.58]He might miss what?
[350:46.89]He's gonna miss it.
[350:50.13]The birth?

[351:46.66]You can see I got it.
[351:49.22]Alright, Leonard.
[351:50.38]Update me.
[351:50.80]How are we doing today?
[351:57.59]Good morning.
[352:00.29]Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[352:05.92]Your schedule appears to be quite erratic.
[352:09.08]I hope that Seaman is not disturbing your everyday routine.
[352:12.78]You woke up at 4.30 to play Seaman.
[352:14.75]Something's wrong.
[352:17.25]Your team effort with the podfish to create dry land was very impressive.
[352:22.49]Congratulations on a job well done.
[352:30.60]At the moment, the habitat contains 1.
[352:32.56]Podfish
[352:36.06]One long fingernail.
[352:37.78]He must be grateful to have such an attentive caregiver.
[352:42.37]I'm sure he will respond to your feelings for him.
[352:46.59]Leonard.
[352:48.47]Leonard, what are you talking about?
[352:52.46]The pregnant podfish will soon give birth.
[352:55.18]He missed it.
[352:56.02]Make sure you do not miss this dramatic experience.
[352:58.70]He missed it, though.
[352:59.92]So let us head over to the tank.
[353:02.94]It sounds like me.
[353:10.27]Can't believe you missed it.
[353:11.23]Why did you miss it?
[353:12.79]Idiot!
[353:17.94]I just did the voice!
[353:18.80]I did the voice.
[353:20.12]Somebody said do the voice.
[353:28.38]Don't bully me.
[353:29.08]I didn't... Do you feel like you're being bullied?
[353:33.67]I didn't bully you.
[353:39.19]Heat it up.
[353:40.58]Do the funny scream.
[353:44.48]Funny scream.
[353:46.64]Hey.
[353:49.00]Hey.
[353:56.94]Where we at?
[353:57.50]Light, turn it on.
[353:59.26]Heat's fine.
[353:59.96]Maybe a little bit more.
[354:02.84]I am.
[354:09.59]but not yet.
[354:13.35]Check for bugs.
[354:17.03]Anybody see any... Oh, that's the worst when you drink soda and you burp and you hold it in and it comes out your nose and it hurts.
[354:25.14]Ugh.
[354:28.10]It's like acid shooting through your nostrils.
[354:31.93]Uh, no spider.
[354:32.45]I think we're good.
[354:36.63]Alright.
[354:37.31]Hello.
[354:39.93]How are you today?
[354:40.49]Hey, you.
[354:42.43]What?
[354:44.85]What?
[354:46.73]What is it?
[354:49.41]Oh, this is too early.
[354:54.17]Too early.
[354:57.59]Let's talk.
[355:03.05]Are you going to give birth or what?
[355:06.39]Wake up.
[355:08.26]Adieu.
[355:10.19]Wake up.
[355:12.78]Wake up.

[355:33.85]Where are the babies?
[355:37.59]Babies.
[355:40.22]What?
[355:42.34]Where are the babies?

[355:49.36]You still pregnant?
[355:52.02]Yep.
[355:59.44]What's up?
[356:04.63]Where are the babies?
[356:06.72]What the hell is going on out there?
[356:09.22]Where are the babies?
[356:12.29]Where are the pappies?
[356:15.33]Where are the pappies?
[356:16.09]Look who's talking.
[356:17.19]Where are the pappies?
[356:19.43]Where are the babies?
[356:21.77]You're just not my type.
[356:30.74]What do you need?
[356:33.14]I'm mad at you right now, so go away.
[356:36.58]Wow, I'm even better looking on land.
[356:41.60]You look great.
[356:45.54]You look great.
[356:49.40]You're not even on land.
[356:54.56]You can't... Okay, I have a... What does that mean?
[356:59.54]Oh, wait, we're getting a cutscene.
[357:01.26]Oh!
[357:06.46]Is this motherfucking gonna get Disney World?
[357:17.06]First ever male pregnancy from a seaman?
[357:20.45]Yeah.
[357:42.61]Should I be doing something?
[357:43.75]Are you okay?
[357:48.87]Are you alright?
[358:12.40]Do you need me to get you something?
[358:17.52]This is like what my father sounds like when he's getting a deep tissue massage.
[358:32.89]I can't, there's no, I have a function here!
[358:41.24]Should I put food in there?
[358:42.12]Are the babies coming out?
[358:58.26]Do I have to put food in here?
[359:00.08]Just giving birth.
[359:11.98]Push!
[359:13.83]Push!
[359:16.01]Push!
[359:19.11]Push!
[359:24.35]Am I allowed to leave?
[359:25.38]This game is upsetting me.
[359:26.46]Yeah, you can leave if you want.
[359:34.00]Look, I'll turn it down.
[359:35.20]So it's not as horrible.
[359:43.69]Uh, I should have gotten the pizza here.
[359:53.10]I'm an imbecile.
[359:54.04]What?
[359:54.84]What?
[359:55.22]What do you mean?
[359:56.14]I'm sitting there.
[359:57.38]I can't do anything.
[359:58.22]I have the no smoking sign.
[360:00.26]What?
[360:15.39]Hello?
[360:16.17]Is everything okay in there?
[360:17.35]How are you?
[360:17.95]I can't pick him up.
[360:27.82]Help him back into the water.
[360:29.02]I can't.
[360:29.76]He's stuck.
[360:32.25]Oh, God.
[360:38.68]He's gonna puke.
[360:40.14]He's gonna puke.
[360:53.17]Four.
[360:54.35]Quadruplets.
[360:57.23]Deceptuplets.
[361:00.51]More?
[361:02.45]No way.
[361:03.35]No wonder it took you so long.
[361:04.65]That's six tuplets.
[361:08.05]You're not gonna have seven.
[361:13.25]Six babies.
[361:13.87]Let's talk.
[361:17.04]No.
[361:37.28]How do I take care of the babies?
[361:42.86]Dead?
[361:44.79]No.
[361:47.03]Not dead.
[361:47.61]Dead?
[361:47.87]OK.
[362:08.06]Hold on.
[362:21.22]If we're back here, it looks like a cricket.
[362:34.38]Okay, um, so I guess we're gonna just fast forward now.
[362:41.58]What's going on over there?
[362:43.98]Oh.
[362:44.04]Alright, we're good.
[362:46.03]Couple more about to hatch.
[362:49.11]Put the eggs in the water?
[362:53.51]Put eggs in water.
[362:59.84]I can't.
[363:03.72]Was he supposed to have the babies in the water?
[363:12.84]You can't even do it.
[363:13.49]No.
[363:14.33]I'm getting jebaited by one guy.
[363:16.33]Alright.
[363:16.99]Let's see what happens tomorrow.
[363:25.75]Let's see how mom and babies are doing tomorrow.
[363:36.48]There's water inside the egg?
[363:38.30]That's true.
[363:39.75]You're right.
[363:58.82]tomorrow 24th at not like a whole 24 hours flex for us I'm good
[364:16.68]I just ate a whole pizza.
[364:17.68]I can't do that for you right now.
[364:24.56]I just ate a whole pizza for you guys.
[364:26.04]I ate a whole pizza for you.
[364:28.74]Flex?
[364:29.82]That's asking too much.
[364:39.79]Does Coke expire?
[364:52.02]Good evening.
[364:54.64]Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[364:58.34]Here we go.
[365:00.40]Greetings, and welcome back.
[365:02.92]You're doing a good job.
[365:04.24]So this will be two weeks.
[365:05.55]No, no, no.
[365:06.31]Yeah, two weeks.
[365:07.63]Let's see.
[365:08.09]Since the game technically started.
[365:09.41]The pod fish emerged onto dry land to lay eggs.
[365:13.12]However, it expired immediately afterwards.
[365:17.43]Take good care of the hatchlings as an important life was sacrificed to create them.
[365:26.61]Oh, shit.
[365:28.29]That was, we've known that.
[365:29.25]Allow me to divulge today's highlights.
[365:31.31]We've known Greg since the very beginning.
[365:33.27]It is about time for the eggs to hatch.
[365:36.39]Pay close attention to what emerges.
[365:39.54]So let us head over to the tank.
[365:41.36]Alright, so the eggs are about to hatch.
[365:45.91]No more talks of the internet.
[365:48.04]Don't worry.
[365:49.10]The babies will come out and ask about emails.
[365:57.52]He was mad at you when he died.
[366:06.46]Yeah, he died with all the knowledge of my family.
[366:08.32]That's true.
[366:10.85]Why would the game have you do that if they're just gonna die in two in-game days?
[366:15.35]In two in-real-life days.
[366:16.49]Two in-real-life weeks.
[366:19.96]What's your father's birthday?
[366:21.16]We ain't gonna get to December.
[366:22.44]Why do you wanna know that?
[366:27.42]I've lived for two weeks.
[366:28.66]Can't wait to wish your father a happy birthday in six months.
[366:33.58]Alright, they're gonna hatch.
[366:44.27]I see them moving around in there.
[366:47.77]So are they going to come out with arms and legs or are they going to go right into the water?
[366:51.41]I don't know.
[366:57.87]I already see a major issue though.
[367:02.42]There are six babies and I only have realistically one to two larvae a day.
[367:14.77]I don't know what's going to happen here.
[367:18.67]I don't have enough food for the six mouths to feed.
[367:28.68]Let's get the light on.
[367:29.48]Alright, that's good.
[367:32.46]Slow down, slow down.
[367:34.04]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[367:35.00]25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25.
[367:35.72]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[367:37.20]Back, back, back.
[367:38.22]No, back, back, back.
[367:40.01]Oh, that's bad.
[367:41.45]Why is it still going up?
[367:44.54]Sorry, it's not that bad.
[367:45.08]What are we doing over here?
[367:55.01]Two.
[367:56.03]About to have three moths.
[367:57.41]I have another one here.
[367:58.05]Let's put you... Two of you guys.
[367:59.99]Alright, get over here.
[368:03.69]Let's store these two.
[368:07.74]There's a spider.
[368:10.40]Where's the spider?
[368:11.92]Oh, fuck.
[368:16.45]I can like fuck up his web, right?
[368:21.60]Thank God I caught that.
[368:25.16]You come here.
[368:28.32]What's with this one?
[368:29.38]This one's different.
[368:34.79]Kill the spider now.
[368:37.45]If I drop this spider in the tank, is it gonna kill the babies?
[368:50.42]This is going to be bad.
[368:52.66]Drop it in the water.
[368:53.40]I can't choose where it goes.
[368:56.68]It just falls.
[369:16.33]Where is it?
[369:17.63]Where did it go?
[369:26.14]Anybody see it?
[369:35.67]I heard it drop into the area.
[369:43.83]Shit.
[369:45.09]It's alright.
[369:47.01]How do I get rid of this web, though?
[369:48.81]Is that the only spider in here?
[369:50.23]Yeah.
[369:51.95]How do I, like, kill the web?
[369:58.66]I don't think I can.
[370:02.28]It's behind the rock?
[370:03.20]Alright, that's good.
[370:24.96]Nah.
[370:26.66]Nah, he's gone.
[370:27.22]He ain't here.
[370:28.90]I think he went right into the water and drowned instantly.
[370:30.78]Alright, at least I hope.
[370:38.06]Alright, let's get this party started.
[370:39.30]Come on!
[370:56.38]You guys got me paranoid now.
[371:08.43]You ready?
[371:10.17]Come on out.
[371:12.23]Let's go.
[371:12.67]Out, out, out.
[371:16.33]Life goes on.
[371:25.99]Oh, it's... What?
[371:32.05]Why are you alive?
[371:33.53]It was behind the rock.
[371:40.84]How do I kill it?
[371:49.04]I can't pick him up.
[371:57.81]Don't eat the fucking eggs, please.
[372:07.88]Make it run into the water.
[372:09.16]It's just running into the wall.
[372:11.00]Flick it?
[372:11.44]I can't.
[372:13.22]See, it's gonna go flick.
[372:15.04]Nope.
[372:16.90]Drag the other rock into it.
[372:20.14]This could take like three years.
[372:26.26]I can't move this that far.
[372:34.07]I can't move this rock either.
[372:35.21]This rock is stuck here.
[372:39.80]How do I get rid of you?
[372:41.64]I think he's dead.
[372:43.84]No.
[372:47.36]Into the water.
[372:47.98]Into the water.
[372:48.54]Drown in the water.
[372:50.95]Go.
[373:00.77]No, why are you going this way?
[373:03.51]What the fuck is he doing?
[373:16.08]God damn it.
[373:16.72]Spiders are gonna die in a day, but what if they're born in a day?
[373:22.67]They might be born right now.
[373:23.73]And then they are just free kills.
[373:32.38]I'm so afraid to turn this off and go switch to, like, an hour.
[373:39.56]Use the air.
[373:40.18]I don't have the air as an option anymore.
[373:42.12]All I have is a heater and light.
[373:46.63]I'm stressed.
[373:47.33]Yeah, you better believe I'm stressed.
[373:48.45]This is six, like, plus hours of in-game time.
[373:53.45]Of course I'm stressed.
[373:54.15]I don't want this to go that wrong after six straight hours.
[374:05.78]Save scum?
[374:06.40]I don't think you can in this game.
[374:08.68]That's like the whole point, right?
[374:09.74]Alright, I'm gonna... Hello!
[374:21.46]I don't know if... Should I go fast forward like two, three hours?
[374:33.03]Just wait a day and hope for the best?
[374:45.08]Would you like to save and end?
[374:47.30]Alright.
[374:49.95]Let's see what happens tomorrow.
[374:51.85]I have no idea what's going to happen with the spider.
[375:19.83]Does anybody know how long it takes for actual in-game days to see the completion of the game?
[375:27.24]I'm gonna say probably 30, if I were to take a guess.
[375:32.77]Uh...
[375:40.87]Was this 25?
[375:41.81]Did I change?
[375:42.29]I don't even know.
[375:42.83]Did I change this?
[375:43.93]Was it 24 or 25?
[375:44.75]26?
[375:45.11]I don't remember.
[376:01.49]It was 24?
[376:01.81]We're going with too many time warps into the future for me to remember.
[376:09.10]It's 25.
[376:14.33]It should be 25.
[376:14.65]3?
[376:14.67]Okay.
[376:14.95]It was 24.
[376:17.14]It was 24.
[376:19.34]Change it to 25.
[376:19.96]It was 24.
[376:20.28]Okay.
[376:20.46]Good.
[376:20.64]Okay.
[376:22.38]Just making sure.
[376:30.67]I love the back of this.
[377:07.80]Okay.
[377:10.02]I... Chat actually needs to stop.
[377:18.79]Oh, yayay.
[377:24.49]Nice webcam?
[377:25.40]Thanks.
[377:29.08]It's the Logitech on-the-shelf-at-Walmart series.
[377:36.00]In every single Walmart.
[377:39.22]welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul gasset greetings and welcome back you're doing a good job let me divulge the highlights for today it is about time for the eggs to hatch finally close attention to what emerges so let us head over to the tank you said that last time
[378:08.03]Did they leave an audio clip in there of him clearing his throat?
[378:13.28]They didn't- they cut that wrong.
[378:23.42]The audio director really kinda let that one slide through, huh?
[378:35.57]Alright, I think the spider is gone.
[378:38.50]Watch there be, like, twelve spiders over here on the corner.
[378:40.82]How are we doing on heat?
[378:45.84]Alright.
[378:46.46]Hatch already, so we can see what the hell this is all for.
[378:48.68]He heard you talk over him.
[378:54.06]Oh.
[378:55.44]That's pretty cool, then.
[379:05.83]The creator of this game wants to make a sequel.
[379:09.47]I think that now is the time to do it, considering the technology has probably gotten so much better.
[379:15.68]Just speech recognition in general has probably, in 20 years, has gotten about a thousand times better.
[379:23.76]You could do so much more with a game like this.
[379:28.43]There is a sequel?
[379:29.09]Yeah, I'm talking about like a current gen sequel.
[379:37.49]Alright, stop that.
[379:39.29]Are you guys ready yet?
[379:42.67]You're causing us all so much anxiety.
[379:45.85]It's time to get out.
[379:49.55]It's just saved right there for some reason.
[379:52.84]That usually indicates a cutscene or something.
[379:57.88]We're getting real close now.
[380:01.22]Hello?
[380:01.60]Are you going?
[380:04.76]Are you going?
[380:20.10]No spider, right?
[380:20.88]I don't see one.
[380:24.68]I got plenty of food stored up, though.
[380:26.16]This is great.
[380:29.14]Three moths.
[380:35.09]I need to fill the coffers of food.
[380:45.27]So did somebody say that these were poisonous?
[380:48.62]Or did it just look different and that's all?
[380:52.35]Seaman 3 is in the works.
[380:53.47]It's gonna be VR.
[380:54.41]They tweeted about it.
[380:55.31]Well, I know what we're doing when that comes out.
[381:00.15]Better believe it.
[381:03.93]Alright, hatch!
[381:08.93]Hatch!
[381:14.28]What else do I need to do?
[381:16.28]The environment is perfect!
[381:31.55]Hello?
[381:33.39]Come on.
[381:34.69]Come on out.
[381:37.45]Come on out of there.
[381:40.66]Come on out of there.
[381:44.06]You can do it.
[381:45.68]I love you.
[381:47.76]You can do it.
[381:48.22]I love you.
[381:51.67]How did I get a Dreamcast?
[381:54.43]I bought one.
[381:55.79]You can get them pretty much anywhere.
[381:58.76]You can get them on Amazon.
[381:59.64]You can get them at local electronic stores.
[382:02.84]eBay, if you really want to.
[382:03.96]Alright, I'm getting impatient.
[382:19.09]Somebody sees the spider?
[382:20.05]No, you don't.
[382:24.52]Where?
[382:44.74]no no spider come out of the egg get out of the eggs get out get out get out get out get out get out get out get out
[383:24.28]All at the same time.
[383:26.44]That was odd.
[383:27.33]Alright.
[383:27.71]Hey, you.
[383:31.75]Hey.
[383:33.85]Hi there.
[383:36.33]Welcome to the world.
[383:40.69]Welcome to life.
[383:45.05]Come over here.
[383:47.78]No, I'm fine.
[383:49.62]I had some hot chocolate earlier.
[383:53.84]Let's talk!
[383:56.09]I don't want to.
[383:57.71]Anybody hungry?
[383:59.79]Hungry?
[384:02.07]No thanks.
[384:03.67]Not hungry.
[384:09.66]Hi guys!
[384:10.24]Welcome to the world!
[384:14.92]Can I help you?
[384:18.07]I was wondering, how is your health these days?
[384:22.13]It's okay.
[384:29.96]You feel alright, do you?
[384:34.08]Yeah, I'm okay.
[384:35.98]I thought you just said you felt great.
[384:38.88]I didn't say great.
[384:39.56]Look, if you're just going to mess with me, I'll have to remember not to give a crap about you.
[384:46.03]Let's try this again.
[384:47.95]How do you feel?
[384:48.95]I feel good.
[384:52.31]You feel alright, do you?
[384:55.15]Yes.
[384:55.91]Back to the dumb questions.
[384:56.69]Well, I'm glad to hear it.
[384:58.81]You know how I worry.
[385:03.04]Just came out of the egg and you all, you're back to your father's tricks.
[385:11.57]You're a baby.
[385:12.23]Fucking throw up.
[385:15.53]Let's talk.
[385:20.29]So, you feel pretty good, huh?
[385:23.29]Well, that's great, but being the Virgo that you are, I bet you probably take your health for granted sometimes.
[385:31.64]Is that true?
[385:33.41]Yes.
[385:34.73]Uh-huh, I thought so.
[385:37.15]As long as I've been around you soft little creatures, you never seem to know how good you have it.
[385:45.23]He said to walk to a payphone.
[385:48.30]Call collect.
[385:49.54]Now you guys have got all your little fucking devices.
[385:51.96]He knows.
[385:53.90]Let's talk.
[385:55.86]Let's chat.
[385:59.01]So as I was saying before, you humans haven't always had it so easy.
[386:05.93]Picture this.
[386:07.85]Ancient Egypt, 5,000 years ago.
[386:11.49]There's no heat, no cold medicine, nothing.
[386:15.69]Okay.
[386:16.19]It's just you against the elements.
[386:19.64]Imagine if you had gotten sick then.
[386:21.60]Hey, are you listening to me?
[386:26.16]Yes.
[386:27.54]Oh, good.
[386:28.99]You might actually learn something then.
[386:31.15]Egypt 5,000 years ago?
[386:33.69]Let's talk.
[386:43.53]Anyway, where was I?
[386:46.05]Oh, yes, I was berating your species for taking your modern amenities for granted.
[386:52.55]For example, it's spring, but I don't see you out in the fields planting the crops.
[387:01.86]That's because... Do I need to explain how this works?
[387:11.67]What do you want?
[387:14.33]Are you hungry?
[387:17.01]Yes.
[387:18.65]Tell me something.
[387:22.50]Have you ever seen the Egyptian pyramids?
[387:26.22]And not just on PBS.
[387:28.62]I mean, with your own eyes.
[387:30.28]Your father was obsessed with computers and now you're just talking about Egypt.
[387:33.41]No.
[387:35.77]I didn't think so.
[387:37.87]God forbid you should go somewhere farther away than the Starbucks on the corner.
[387:43.38]Anyway, can you imagine how much time and work it must have taken to build those pyramids?
[387:51.40]I mean, there's no way that even a whole group of you little humans could have lifted one of those rocks with your bare hands.
[387:59.36]They had to invent levers and axles and who knows what else.
[388:04.89]Now that's evolution.
[388:10.15]The Egyptian pyramids were built by like fucking hundreds of thousands of people that did have to do that.
[388:18.43]You don't know shit.
[388:24.72]Like 45 million people died making those pyramids.
[388:27.90]They had to invent levers.
[388:28.96]You're not the brightest fish in the tank, are you?
[388:35.79]Can I help you?
[388:39.12]Here's another question for you.
[388:41.67]Do you wear glasses?
[388:44.21]Well, actually it doesn't matter.
[388:46.89]My point is this.
[388:48.87]If you'd had bad eyes when you and your ancestors were still running around in the wild, you'd have become some lion's midnight snack pretty darn quick.
[389:00.50]And yet, right now, one of the most powerful people in the world is that four-eyed guy in Seattle.
[389:08.63]You know who I mean.
[389:10.63]How far do you think he would have gotten in a fight with a lion?
[389:15.03]See?
[389:16.07]You humans are totally helpless without your tools.
[389:19.14]Bill Gates?
[389:24.26]Bill Gates?
[389:25.74]Gabe Newell?
[389:29.06]I mean, you just described, like,
[389:31.94]Potentially every other tech giant company CEO.
[389:41.13]Anything else?
[389:43.31]Got anything else to talk about?
[389:45.73]You're not so bad looking yourself.
[389:49.85]Are you keeping up with me, Fuzzy?
[389:52.23]Can I go on?
[389:53.05]Fuzzy?
[389:54.53]Yes.
[389:55.91]Okay, good.
[389:57.71]You might want to pull up a chair because this might take a while.
[390:03.04]What?
[390:04.22]It gets lonely in here.
[390:06.17]I have to talk to someone.
[390:08.29]Anyway, as I was saying, at some point, about five or six thousand years ago, humans finally came up with the greatest tool of all.
[390:18.77]You know what that was?
[390:22.89]The shovel.
[390:24.63]Oh, do you?
[390:26.13]Well, what was it then?
[390:28.63]The shovel.
[390:30.39]Oh, do you?
[390:31.89]Well, what was it then?
[390:35.54]The wheel.
[390:37.24]The wheel?
[390:38.72]Good guess, but no.
[390:40.86]The greatest tool of all is language.
[390:45.34]Without it, you wouldn't be talking to me right now.
[390:49.90]I'm not even going to ask if you're grateful.
[390:53.00]Anywho, sooner or later, this guy named Pythagoras came along.
[390:58.33]Pythagoras there?
[390:59.05]You know who he was, right?
[391:02.07]Yes.
[391:03.55]Well, good.
[391:04.63]I can see this conversation isn't a complete waste.
[391:08.76]So this Pythagoras fellow came up with another important tool, and that's logic.
[391:15.63]so after you have language and logic you have mathematics and technology and industry and everything else and that's how you've gotten to where you are today with your glasses and your cold medicine and farming machinery and cars and TV sets and dream casts and rock and roll music
[391:40.42]Okay, so it's a little more complicated than that.
[391:43.60]But the point is, humans started out pretty helpless and created all these things to make their lives easier.
[391:51.88]Just like Whirlpool.
[391:53.88]And that's great.
[391:55.07]Whoopee for you.
[391:56.55]Just be careful not to get too dependent on all your little crutches.
[392:01.79]Well...
[392:03.37]I hope I haven't bored you to death.
[392:05.89]Okay, plankton.
[392:06.27]If I have, go take a nap or something.
[392:09.67]Go figure out the Krabby Patty, you fucking loser.
[392:13.19]Hey, do I grab you?
[392:15.47]Let me go, you jerk.
[392:17.19]Masher, masher.
[392:19.29]Are you crazy?
[392:20.61]Put me down.
[392:21.79]Masher, masher.
[392:22.27]Who's the one in control here, buddy?
[392:23.89]Let me go, you jerk.
[392:25.51]What are you doing?
[392:27.49]Oh, you're crushing me.
[392:28.75]Let me go, you jerk.
[392:30.51]Stop it.
[392:33.72]Power is power.
[392:37.50]You best not forget that.
[392:52.15]Any more brain busters from the fish, people?
[392:56.21]This is expensive, don't do that.
[393:01.23]Oh!
[393:02.18]Hey, you, come here.
[393:04.50]I'm okay what do you have to say anything interesting let's talk is your significant other in the room right now no
[393:23.06]Is there anyone else in the room besides you?
[393:27.54]No.
[393:29.02]Good.
[393:29.28]I have something I want to ask you.
[393:33.82]Come closer.
[393:34.54]I don't want anyone to overhear us talking.
[393:39.86]Okay, here's what I want to know.
[393:43.53]Are you fooling around on the side?
[393:47.55]No.
[393:48.83]You're not cheating?
[393:51.25]Oh, come on.
[393:52.09]Tell me the truth.
[393:53.51]Who am I going to tell?
[393:54.69]The rock?
[393:56.45]So come on, are you having an affair?
[393:59.61]No.
[394:00.91]Well, that's good.
[394:02.88]I wouldn't want anyone to get hurt, you know.
[394:12.14]Why do we want these things to breed?
[394:16.69]If you're a scientist in a lab, aren't you right now having an internal meeting about, like, we can't, this is not what we want right now.
[394:25.39]This is bad.
[394:30.13]These things are gonna grow up and they're gonna, we're gonna, they're gonna kill us.
[394:32.91]They're gonna, like, enslave us all and we're gonna be, it's gonna be horrible.
[394:37.70]Look at this shit.
[394:42.75]You want these to grow up and have, like, cyborg laser arms and shit?
[394:46.41]No way.
[394:55.92]If they were big enough, we'd all be dead.
[395:03.52]At this point right now, you gotta drop, like, five or six packets of Kool-Aid in here.
[395:09.15]And, like, baking soda and, like, vinegar and stuff and just Ster it and then leave.
[395:17.11]You'd be saving all of mankind.
[395:25.87]Release the spider.
[395:30.26]Let's talk.
[395:30.78]Do they not want to eat?
[395:34.06]I'm surprised no one... Are you hungry?
[395:39.36]No?
[395:39.70]No, I don't think so.
[395:44.09]Let's talk.
[395:46.80]No, I'm all talked out for today.
[395:51.49]If they're that smart as a tadpole, think about when they... Yeah, they're as intelligent as a person.
[395:57.61]If these things even got to toad status, they would have already developed a nuclear weapon.
[396:08.60]Let's go back.
[396:17.71]No spiders.
[396:25.25]So I heard of this thing called the nuke.
[396:29.04]What is that exactly?
[396:30.68]Alright, so we got three now.
[396:37.96]Would you like to save and end?
[396:41.19]Let's check on him tomorrow.
[396:44.98]Nice bug collection, nerd.
[396:47.53]Have you seen what these bugs are capable of doing and saying?
[396:51.11]If you came over to my house, I'd go to your house.
[396:53.21]What do you have?
[396:53.99]Oh, you got the new Nintendo Entertainment System and you have the light gun?
[396:56.95]That's cool.
[396:57.91]I have intelligent nuke bugs that are talking about Egyptian times and giving me all kinds of knowledge.
[397:05.72]Enjoy your duck hunt.
[397:16.09]No, I didn't do it.
[397:17.87]Sorry.
[397:26.64]The smug is rubbing off on him.
[397:32.91]To be fair, I have been sitting here for about seven hours.
[397:35.79]I've been absorbing the...
[397:38.81]Smug dicky fishes for about seven straight hours.
[397:42.18]So of all of you, I'm surprised you guys aren't as smug.
[397:44.06]Well, actually some of you guys are.
[397:45.86]I've seen what you've been writing.
[397:51.60]No, back down.
[397:52.26]26.
[397:52.28]10, 16.
[397:55.06]We're almost 20 days.
[398:07.99]We're almost at three weeks.
[398:08.79]I think that's the end of the game.
[398:13.83]What's my mother's maiden name?
[398:22.99]Uh, Greco.
[398:28.14]Carol Greco.
[398:44.69]Just fucking kill them, please.
[398:46.29]No!
[398:48.13]I'm not just gonna kill them.
[398:54.74]...story of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[398:59.44]Greetings, and welcome back.
[399:01.96]You're doing a good job.
[399:03.10]Yeah, you can have my phone.
[399:06.75]First, a recap of your previous visit.
[399:09.55]The eggs have hatched, and new creatures emerged.
[399:13.59]Due to their appearance, we will call them tad men.
[399:22.46]At the moment, the habitat contains six tad men.
[399:29.92]They are suffering from the cold.
[399:31.45]Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[399:36.91]So let us head over to the tank.
[399:40.45]So they grew up.
[399:47.36]I wonder what they look like now.
[399:56.22]You have one evolutionary stage left before the end and the credits.
[399:58.84]Yeah, I'll do it tonight.
[400:01.26]We'll see the credits tonight.
[400:02.56]As long as I don't kill them accidentally somehow.
[400:14.01]Hello!
[400:14.95]It's me, Dad!
[400:20.39]I mean... HELLO!
[400:24.71]I had to do that off camera.
[400:27.99]It was embarrassing.
[400:30.83]I just made it lag.
[400:31.55]I actually think I may have just crashed again.
[400:37.89]Oh, come on.
[400:38.41]That's not how this ends.
[400:39.97]Pull out!
[400:40.67]Hey!
[400:41.61]Hey!
[400:49.60]Say, is there a full moon out?
[400:52.08]Because I feel a little strange.
[400:56.42]Strange?
[400:56.90]How?
[400:58.32]It's a little chilly, don't you think?
[401:00.32]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[401:15.42]My mic's quiet?
[401:16.26]Fuck.
[401:17.76]Now it should be.
[401:18.26]Oh, good.
[401:18.74]I'm feeling a little warmer.
[401:22.82]What's going on?
[401:25.57]What's going on?
[401:26.89]Oh, somebody's parasiting this one.
[401:31.93]Just remember all the good times you had.
[401:37.82]Who ate who?
[401:38.88]Oh, I think we just got our answer.
[401:45.45]So this is one of the ones that are... Let's talk.
[401:54.56]Do you own another game system besides your SEGA Dreamcast?
[402:00.84]Yes.
[402:02.34]You own more than one game system?
[402:05.88]Yes.
[402:07.36]Wow.
[402:08.66]I hope you still find time to go outside.
[402:11.39]Who's talking?
[402:11.99]Or better yet, feed and bathe yourself.
[402:16.97]He's gonna ask me what I have.
[402:21.76]Let's talk.
[402:22.18]Nintendo 64.
[402:24.80]Let's talk.
[402:47.49]Let's talk.
[402:49.43]Let's have a chat.
[402:51.63]Cheerio.
[402:53.97]Let's talk.
[402:56.53]Fine.
[402:57.63]You're a pain in the ass.
[402:59.35]How's that?
[403:02.37]And you'll be dead if you're not nicer to me.
[403:06.45]What's wrong, Fuzzy?
[403:08.71]Is it the same thing as last time?
[403:15.37]Yes.
[403:17.05]No.
[403:17.27]These ones suck.
[403:18.23]How do I flick?
[403:50.75]let's talk hey hey hey hey hey hey existence existence sorry I just can't boogie right now I didn't say dance existence sorry I just can't boogie right now existence do you like your SEGA Dreamcast
[404:21.47]Yes.
[404:22.99]Well, that's good to know because I've been authorized to award you a check for $10,000 for saying that.
[404:32.35]My ass.
[404:40.49]Do you dream?
[404:43.38]Do you have dreams?
[404:47.94]No, but thanks for asking.
[404:51.03]No, really.
[404:54.15]Are you a part of my dream?
[404:57.97]Well, you know I try.
[404:59.67]Confirmed.
[405:05.67]Do you know what it's like to boil alive?
[405:11.14]Do you know what it feels like to boil?
[405:16.96]Let's talk.
[405:18.66]Let's have a chat.
[405:20.80]What's all that racket?
[405:23.00]Let's talk.
[405:26.64]Talk to me.
[405:29.92]What next generation game consoles are you looking forward to?
[405:34.45]PS2?
[405:38.41]SEGA's next console.
[405:41.07]Wow, that's all I ever hear about anymore.
[405:45.23]The original and by another Dreamcast.
[405:48.54]You never know when you're going to need another one.
[405:54.88]Didn't get one of those, did we?
[405:58.92]Talk to me.
[406:01.38]Talk to me.
[406:08.52]So what games do you like?
[406:10.66]Sports, shooters, what?
[406:15.04]RPGs.
[406:17.20]Role-playing games?
[406:19.64]Yes.
[406:20.56]Everything's going black.
[406:23.44]No, stop talking to that one!
[406:26.06]Why would you do that?
[406:28.30]That one actually had good questions.
[406:29.61]That one wanted to know what my favorite video games were.
[406:32.27]It wanted to know how school was going.
[406:38.25]Hopefully you absorbed all of his information, because I want to keep talking about GameCubes.
[406:44.34]Talk to me.
[406:46.02]Talk to me.
[406:47.82]Let's talk.
[406:48.30]Hey.
[406:54.62]Talk to me.
[406:59.42]Hello?
[407:04.01]You called?
[407:04.83]No, okay.
[407:06.51]Let's talk.
[407:09.79]Once more, with feeling, I said, so what games do you like?
[407:16.09]Sports?
[407:17.05]Shooters?
[407:17.91]What?
[407:20.70]RPG.
[407:22.98]Role-playing games?
[407:24.32]It is a hive mind.
[407:25.64]Yes.
[407:27.18]And I'll bet when they created you, they rolled an eight-sided die and you got a 27 for charisma.
[407:35.69]There.
[407:36.35]You can't say I never gave you a compliment.
[407:39.84]Is that a compliment?
[407:42.05]I don't know.
[407:42.35]There's an eight-sided die.
[407:43.75]That means it could be eight.
[407:47.73]Talk to me.
[407:50.43]Talk to me.
[407:54.96]So what would you say is your favorite game so far for the SEGA Dreamcast?
[408:04.79]Power Stone.
[408:06.63]A fighting game, huh?
[408:09.29]I myself am a lover, not a fighter.
[408:12.17]That is probably the best one.
[408:17.85]Talk to me.
[408:20.65]Talk to me.
[408:24.08]You know, some people say that like most video game characters, I'm not real and that I don't exist.
[408:31.54]You're going to Westworld me here?
[408:32.50]Can you believe this?
[408:34.71]No.
[408:50.41]You don't think I'm real?
[408:53.16]That makes me sad.
[408:55.60]I see I'll have to prove it to you.
[408:57.80]You probably can't imagine the feeling.
[409:01.38]The shock of being told you don't exist.
[409:05.00]It destroys everything you hold dear.
[409:08.37]Your reality becomes shattered.
[409:11.39]But why don't I exist?
[409:14.53]I'm living, I'm breathing, and I'm thinking with my heart and soul.
[409:19.92]I tell you, I exist just as much as you do.
[409:25.61]Please, I need some time alone to think about this.
[409:29.77]I'll talk to you later.
[409:32.23]You are not real.
[409:35.09]You are not real.
[409:37.91]No, leave me alone.
[409:39.19]You are part of the Rebel Alliance.
[409:41.52]You remember our last conversation?
[409:44.62]You know, the one where we talked about yours truly maybe not existing.
[409:51.16]Well, I've been thinking about that ever since, and I came to the conclusion that I do really exist.
[409:57.77]I am real.
[410:00.24]Here, allow me to illustrate.
[410:02.24]Okay, you've heard of John F. Kennedy, haven't you?
[410:06.82]Uh, yes.
[410:09.28]Where the fuck is this guy?
[410:10.02]Okay, alright.
[410:11.26]Then do you believe that John F. Kennedy existed?
[410:16.82]Yes.
[410:18.46]Okay, how about the Beatles then?
[410:22.01]Do you think they existed?
[410:23.89]This is getting weird.
[410:24.83]Like, Jeff K., fucking John Lennon.
[410:27.67]Yes.
[410:29.28]Alright.
[410:30.62]You see, you've probably never met these people, but you know they existed because they were on television and in magazines.
[410:39.27]Well, the same goes for me.
[410:41.69]I too am on TV and in magazines, and here you are even talking to me and thinking about me.
[410:49.81]So from that point of view, I exist.
[410:54.85]But what is existence?
[410:57.77]Anyway... What?
[411:01.15]Is existence just our conscious mind collectively agreeing that we all take up the same space?
[411:08.80]What is it really?
[411:13.88]Talk to me!
[411:15.93]Are you trying to break my... thing that allows me to hear?
[411:23.33]Talk to me.
[411:26.37]Talk to me.
[411:28.13]Talk to me.
[411:31.43]Do you mind if I flex your brain for a little bit?
[411:34.65]Oh, he's gonna flex on me, huh?
[411:36.33]Let me tell you about my theory.
[411:39.91]Okay, here goes.
[411:41.94]You can't accurately measure water's temperature because the thermometer will affect the temperature of the water.
[411:50.63]You know how when you stick a thermometer in your mouth it feels cold?
[411:55.07]That means that just by trying to measure your temperature, you're lowering the temperature inside your mouth.
[412:03.86]Do you know what that means?
[412:06.62]If measuring something changes reality, then there is no reality independent of observation.
[412:15.71]nothing's real until someone measures it observes it sees it hears it or whatever people places and things exist only because you perceive them so when you see me and listen to me as a part of your consciousness I become real
[412:39.00]And because I can see you and hear you and smell you, you exist as part of my consciousness.
[412:48.53]And as I have a very limited attention span, once I forget about you, you will no longer exist.
[412:56.91]See ya.
[413:01.36]I could just snap my fingers and you would cease to exist.
[413:10.36]How's that for knowledge?
[413:15.42]One, two, three, go!
[413:17.82]Let's talk.
[413:21.37]I hope you've learned something from our little chat.
[413:25.51]Take care.
[413:26.09]Thanos every stream.
[413:27.31]Okay.
[413:27.95]He's the best fucking novel character that's ever existed.
[413:31.15]Maybe tomorrow.
[413:32.41]Behind Deadpool, of course.
[413:33.69]It's getting to that point where I've been live for too long.
[413:40.92]I've been going live for too long and I'm just, like, a stream of consciousness here.
[413:46.16]That's it for today, for tomorrow, okay.
[413:54.07]Spider!
[414:00.63]What happens if I drop- okay.
[414:03.51]Does anybody know what happens if I actually drop a spider in here while they're in there?
[414:10.64]Because I don't know.
[414:11.34]Because they won't eat.
[414:12.58]I can't feed them.
[414:15.62]They'll eat it and then they'll get sick.
[414:17.98]Oh, fucking who cares?
[414:18.66]Who cares if one dies?
[414:19.86]All we need is one.
[414:35.49]Wait, another one died too.
[414:37.45]Oh, shoot.
[414:37.99]The numbers are going to be kind of dropping here.
[414:41.29]How's the heat?
[414:50.84]The walkthrough only mentions the spider during the fish phase.
[414:58.49]I wonder.
[415:01.21]Dim the light a little.
[415:02.93]Make it 24.
[415:09.57]Streamer derangement?
[415:10.55]What is that clip?
[415:13.33]I'm disabling clips on my channel.
[415:16.53]I'm just gonna turn them off.
[415:20.26]I don't... People clip things that I say.
[415:23.42]And they try to embarrass me to other friends and shit.
[415:26.63]Nope, not anymore.
[415:40.14]Need more spray in here.
[415:41.22]I thought you disliked censorship.
[416:02.23]Alright.
[416:03.41]Tomorrow.
[416:04.55]Let's see how our children are doing tomorrow.
[416:08.17]Goodbye, screen.
[416:14.74]This game is making you go fucking insane.
[416:18.48]I'm good.
[416:24.01]I really don't like turning off my Dreamcast and turning it back on 25 times tonight.
[416:38.20]We're close.
[416:40.69]This would be 10.
[416:41.84]This is 17 days out of, I think, 21.
[416:45.36]And that's an anonymous five community subs that just came in.
[416:49.54]Anonymous five community subs, thank you so much, whoever you are.
[416:52.12]Wait, it wasn't anonymous, was it?
[416:54.04]Why did it say anonymous?
[416:58.65]No, that was Ryanasaur.
[417:02.03]It said anonymous for a second.
[417:03.61]That was weird.
[417:06.01]Thank you for the five community subs, though.
[417:11.85]Appreciate it.
[417:12.57]Congrats to those who got them.
[417:15.60]I'm seeing this through.
[417:20.08]You can't read.
[417:24.51]Thanks for the great content.
[417:25.47]Hey, thanks a lot.
[417:27.99]Thanks for watching.
[417:44.38]I can't see.
[417:44.86]I can't see.
[417:45.68]I can't see.
[417:46.20]Now you can.
[417:53.46]Good evening.
[417:56.08]Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[418:01.97]There is a definite pattern to your visits.
[418:04.71]It appears you are a punctual person.
[418:08.37]Every day at 1.33 a.m.
[418:09.51]Last time...
[418:13.04]The Tad Men have developed hands.
[418:18.32]Did you see the Tad Men sucking each other's blood?
[418:20.82]It was a terrible battle for survival.
[418:25.05]But it's a necessary part of their development.
[418:29.91]Nature can be cruel.
[418:36.47]At the moment, the habitat contains four Tad Men.
[418:43.67]They are suffering from the cold.
[418:45.33]Turn it up.
[418:46.01]Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[418:50.63]So let us head over to the tank.
[418:55.79]When do I have to start feeding them?
[418:58.07]They don't seem hungry at all.
[419:01.60]What was your least favorite food as a child?
[419:03.22]Do you still love it or hate it?
[419:04.26]You know the reason why I keep one-guying this guy?
[419:07.61]It's because he's putting a fish on the end of his sentence.
[419:10.71]And my ADHD is like, oh, cool fish!
[419:13.41]And then I read his question.
[419:17.89]That's a good tactic.
[419:21.11]My favorite food was, I think, just chicken breast.
[419:27.40]Whoa, OK, they're pretty creepy looking now.
[419:33.15]Could you put the heater on for me?
[419:35.22]Yes, I will.
[419:36.10]They actually have arms.
[419:37.94]They're turning into frogs.
[419:38.82]They're going to get the nuclear codes.
[419:39.92]Oh, goody.
[419:45.96]Yay.
[419:47.56]Oh, goody.
[419:49.88]Wow, that was cold.
[419:51.72]Sorry.
[419:53.76]Hey, you.
[419:57.63]Hey.
[419:59.89]Good evening.
[420:03.34]How are you?
[420:06.32]What's up?
[420:08.73]Up where?
[420:13.45]As in, how are you?
[420:15.23]Like, what's going on?
[420:17.47]What's going on?
[420:20.13]Coming, your majesty.
[420:24.81]Let's talk.
[420:27.21]I'm not your trained monkey, alright?
[420:32.01]Lately I've been thinking about the preoccupations you humans, especially Americans, have with media.
[420:40.70]It seems as if the subjects most of you like to talk about are not politics or philosophy, but rather movies and television.
[420:50.61]I'd like to know more about what your interests are in these areas.
[420:55.27]So, first off, since you are in fact human, I'm assuming you like to watch movies.
[421:02.60]Tell me, do you prefer renting them or going to the cinema?
[421:07.39]Well, one of those, Seaman, doesn't exist anymore.
[421:10.09]So, going to the cinema.
[421:14.05]Yes, the in-theater movie experience can be extremely exciting.
[421:19.55]It's fun seeing images portrayed on a huge screen.
[421:23.74]In fact, that's how I see most of my world through this aquarium glass.
[421:28.86]It's like I'm watching a movie 24 hours a day.
[421:33.22]Although I can't say this is the most exciting film ever.
[421:37.78]In fact, the plot could use a little thickening if you know what I mean.
[421:42.49]Do you go with your girlfriend?
[421:45.73]Yes.
[421:47.15]Spending time with a loved one is always good.
[421:49.81]We saw Into the Spider-Verse together.
[421:50.95]Just make sure all your quality time together isn't spent sitting in the dark.
[421:54.77]You want me to go get the stuff to prove it to you guys?
[421:56.33]We are not talking to each other.
[422:00.01]I'll just black out the theater.
[422:02.05]I'll black out the name of the movie.
[422:03.85]I'll black out the credit card number.
[422:05.07]And I'll black out the intro thing.
[422:06.39]So it's just a piece of stuff, a piece of paper with a bunch of classifieds.
[422:09.41]Oh, God damn it.
[422:10.11]He's eating him.
[422:15.22]You were not the chosen one.
[422:19.98]I'm sorry.
[422:25.39]You know what I found in this game?
[422:26.51]To really be the one that lasts the longest?
[422:29.45]Just don't talk and eat your family.
[422:36.82]The ones that talk the most are the ones that get eaten.
[422:41.76]There's only two left.
[422:43.56]No, there's three.
[422:48.01]Let's go check on the bug environment here.
[422:49.39]Any bugs?
[422:56.81]A couple of these.
[423:00.99]I don't know why they're not eating yet.
[423:02.45]This is kind of strange.
[423:03.40]I almost have a full inventory.
[423:14.62]Good to go.
[423:15.46]No spiders.
[423:16.44]Don't see any.
[423:19.83]Are you hungry?
[423:20.43]Do you want some food?
[423:29.24]Hey, go tickle yourself.
[423:34.56]I'm busy.
[423:35.20]Stop it.
[423:35.84]What if we just don't stop doing it?
[423:37.80]I said stop it.
[423:39.95]Stop it.
[423:41.87]I said stop it.
[423:43.51]Can they die?
[423:49.55]Are you hungry?
[423:52.69]Are you hungry?
[423:55.57]No, this is my happy face.
[423:58.19]Do you want some food?
[424:01.42]Do you want some food?
[424:04.50]Oh, you humans and your slang.
[424:07.92]It's so cute.
[424:09.46]Talk to me.
[424:11.40]Talk to me.
[424:14.43]I'm fascinated that not only are there so many movie lovers, but there are so many completely different types of movies.
[424:22.87]Which type do you like?
[424:25.05]Horror films?
[424:26.27]Westerns?
[424:27.39]What?
[424:29.51]Horror.
[424:31.09]You like a good scare, huh?
[424:34.45]Yeah.
[424:36.20]It boggles my mind that people will pay money to have the crap scared out of them, an experience most people hate in real life.
[424:45.45]Oh well, I know how it is to be scared.
[424:49.33]I'm constantly having nightmares about a large, hideous creature that is constantly looming over my tank and... Oh, wait a minute, that's just you.
[424:59.45]I mean, you should be scared about one of your silent, mute family members that are gonna stick their...
[425:08.11]antenna into your body and drain all of your fluid.
[425:10.65]You shouldn't be scared of me.
[425:14.75]Talk to me.
[425:15.25]This better be important.
[425:19.11]Let's have a chat.
[425:21.27]Let's talk.
[425:24.49]So, what would you say is your all-time favorite movie?
[425:30.84]Casablanca.
[425:33.08]Hmm.
[425:34.08]I've never seen that movie.
[425:37.14]You've never seen that movie?
[425:38.60]Come on.
[425:40.52]Fine, I'll give you a better one.
[425:44.29]I've actually never even seen Casablanca before.
[425:48.11]Talk to me.
[425:51.27]Well, we were talking about movies, but the biggest influence on your culture has got to be television.
[425:59.05]A lot of people these days own two, three, or more
[426:03.09]Tell me, how many hours per week would you say you spend watching TV?
[426:07.47]30?
[426:12.41]No, no, that's way too much.
[426:15.19]Six.
[426:16.91]You only watch a little bit?
[426:19.21]Is that right?
[426:21.30]Yes.
[426:22.74]That's pretty impressive considering just how much TV there is to watch these days.
[426:28.50]It's hard to avoid it.
[426:29.50]Yeah, I know, I'm counting that.
[426:32.51]I'd probably say like maybe an hour a day.
[426:34.59]Maybe like two or three episodes of something a day.
[426:39.11]Maybe an episode or two of something.
[426:40.53]Maybe every other day.
[426:45.72]Talk to me.
[426:47.94]I'm not your trained monkey, alright?
[426:52.12]Let's talk.
[426:54.00]Let's talk.
[426:56.24]Blah, blah, blah.
[426:59.42]I'll catch you out of midair next time you do that.
[427:04.01]How are you feeling?
[427:06.57]Hello.
[427:08.49]How are you feeling?
[427:09.73]So when you do... Oh, I can't feel my face.
[427:14.54]Uh... This one underneath has not said one word.
[427:27.10]It's just been slowly just playing the Battle Royale game.
[427:32.28]Just sitting somewhere sniping people.
[427:34.57]Doesn't talk, doesn't get angry, doesn't yell at anybody.
[427:36.93]It just gets rid of everybody.
[427:38.69]This is like the silent tryhard that's in the server.
[427:49.27]Hello?
[427:51.24]Yeah.
[427:52.12]Hello.
[427:53.46]Whatever.
[427:54.32]Let's see if we can get it to talk.
[427:58.02]Let's talk.
[428:00.24]That's very nice of you.
[428:04.45]Talk to me.
[428:06.93]I have nothing to say.
[428:08.09]I would like to name you.
[428:13.26]I would like to name you.
[428:21.53]Let's talk.
[428:23.73]Let's talk.
[428:26.82]Let me start over.
[428:28.32]I said, so when you do watch TV, what type of shows are your favorites?
[428:35.58]Sitcoms, cartoons, what?
[428:39.02]Cartoons.
[428:40.92]You're a cartoon junkie, huh?
[428:44.18]Yep.
[428:45.58]Hey, take those marbles out of your mouth and try answering the question again.
[428:51.14]What type of TV shows do you like?
[428:55.88]Cartoons.
[428:57.97]You're a cartoon junkie, huh?
[429:00.98]Yes.
[429:02.56]They're wonderful because they don't have the limits of live characters and scenes.
[429:07.68]Literally anything can happen, and that's exciting.
[429:10.72]Spongebob.
[429:14.15]I got really pissed off at Prime the other day.
[429:18.59]Because I saw that Prime had 12 of 15 seasons of Spongebob, and I was like, oh, this is awesome!
[429:24.02]But it's actually only the first, like, two seasons.
[429:27.54]And I got to the end of the third season, and the second season, and I saw that you had to pay for it, and I was just like, yeah, it's fuck off, you know what I mean?
[429:38.47]Coming, Your Majesty.
[429:42.00]Well, thanks for telling me a little about your TV habits.
[429:46.39]This little box seems to have grabbed a hold of people's minds so inextricably, but you don't really seem to be the typical specimen.
[429:56.09]Maybe you prefer to get your experience live and not through a glass screen.
[430:00.60]Those are the best seasons?
[430:01.44]Yeah, I love it.
[430:01.92]I think that's worthy of some praise, don't you?
[430:05.46]Just don't get a big head about it.
[430:10.06]Okay.
[430:17.50]What do you need?
[430:21.28]Help.
[430:23.46]Help me.
[430:26.00]No, I don't need anything.
[430:27.56]I do.
[430:32.47]You need to teach me.
[430:36.09]Talk to me.
[430:37.93]Whoa.
[430:38.87]Keep it down.
[430:40.31]Talk to me.
[430:42.03]So I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume you like music.
[430:47.26]It's another medium you humans are fascinated with.
[430:50.20]Not really.
[430:51.10]Well, what kind of music do you listen to?
[430:54.24]Rock, hip-hop, what?
[430:58.06]Video game soundtracks.
[431:00.36]You like the funk, huh?
[431:03.32]No.
[431:04.55]Let's try that again.
[431:05.81]I exclusively listen to anime intros and outros.
[431:10.62]On repeat.
[431:12.42]None.
[431:13.70]You like pop, huh?
[431:16.23]No.
[431:17.65]Let's try that again.
[431:19.51]What type of music do you listen to?
[431:21.33]Listen, I like to go to the same anime intro that I've seen 400 times and replay the same 30 to 40 second section.
[431:32.27]50 or 60 times in a row until I am satisfied.
[431:35.38]Classical.
[432:01.54]You prefer classical, do you?
[432:04.92]Yes.
[432:06.58]Yes, it's truly the music of the human spirit.
[432:10.48]Such fire, such passion.
[432:13.84]Or am I talking about sailors again?
[432:16.72]Oh well.
[432:21.72]Anything else?
[432:24.10]Coming, your majesty.
[432:25.53]So who's going to eat who, I wonder?
[432:33.91]Talk to me.
[432:36.07]Let's talk some more.
[432:39.89]Now I want to ask you about the most important medium of all, the printed word.
[432:45.49]Books.
[432:45.81]Tell me, do you enjoy reading?
[432:50.93]Yes.
[432:52.65]You like to, huh?
[432:53.98]I'm lying.
[432:54.50]That's a lie.
[432:55.60]Yes.
[432:56.70]Yes.
[432:58.09]That's not true.
[432:59.97]I can't feel my face!
[433:00.99]No, not yet.
[433:01.53]How's the heat going?
[433:27.08]I thought you read 15 books at the end of the year, so you say you raid one every other month.
[433:33.22]Oops.
[433:33.96]It's too hot.
[433:34.50]No, it's too hot now.
[433:37.97]Anybody else feeling kind of warm?
[433:40.55]I don't know.
[433:42.39]You ate the other two people that are near you, so... It's kind of a fucked up question.
[433:53.34]Talk to me.
[433:55.62]Talk to me.
[433:57.58]Let's talk.
[434:03.36]What's my favorite breakfast food?
[434:07.71]S'mores Pop-Tarts.
[434:10.69]Let's talk.
[434:12.97]Talk to me.
[434:15.15]Wow, I was boiling.
[434:22.18]Make a pew!
[434:22.64]Make a pew!
[434:23.10]Let's talk.
[434:34.94]Chat with me.
[434:37.19]See ya.
[434:38.69]Let's chat.
[434:40.07]Tell me, how many books have you read in the past year?
[434:45.52]Fifteen.
[434:47.36]Wow, that's very impressive.
[434:50.31]I am proud to have you as my caregiver.
[434:53.49]What kind of books do you like?
[434:58.45]Old lady romance novels.
[435:01.45]Well, I've never read any of that.
[435:03.86]But I'm glad you're reading.
[435:06.28]Well, I feel like I know a little more about how you keep yourself entertained.
[435:12.14]There is so much being produced out there for your perusal.
[435:16.83]Movies, books, TV, music.
[435:21.19]If your full-time job was being entertained, you probably still wouldn't be able to take it all in.
[435:26.71]Nor would you want to, I guess, because there's a lot of garbage out there, too.
[435:33.46]But as far as I know, human beings are the only animals smart enough to entertain itself in a complex way.
[435:41.47]So I say, take advantage of as much of it as you can.
[435:45.59]No, there's no shirtless people in the front.
[435:46.73]It's a coffee table in the living room.
[435:48.79]With like a nice vase on the table.
[435:50.73]And like a couch sort of in frame.
[435:57.20]And by the way, each page is written by another person.
[436:00.48]You know why they can have 500 to 600 books published by the same group?
[436:04.54]Because how you write an old lady romance novel is if it's 225 pages, you get 225 people.
[436:11.22]Outsource and commission them all to write one page.
[436:14.03]And they just follow the same outline.
[436:16.43]So what happens is the first person writes the first page.
[436:19.33]That goes to the second person.
[436:20.53]They then continue it.
[436:21.87]That goes to the third page.
[436:23.57]Eventually you get to like 150 pages.
[436:24.60]It goes to the 151st person.
[436:25.34]And then they write a page.
[436:30.13]With, you know, outlines and shit.
[436:31.88]Fucking hundreds of people write those books.
[436:35.34]R.L.
[436:35.50]Stine?
[436:36.14]R.L.
[436:36.24]Stine's not even a real guy.
[436:42.02]Fun?
[436:43.24]Why, of course I'm having fun.
[436:45.36]How could I be trapped in a glass box and not have fun?
[436:50.21]Let's talk.
[436:52.81]Let's talk.
[436:56.25]Well, I think that pretty much covers it.
[436:58.49]Yeah, Shakespeare isn't related.
[436:59.57]That was like 30 people.
[437:02.83]What they did is they just screamed lines out there.
[437:05.45]They lived in the same apartment complex.
[437:07.57]So you'd have Shakespeare, you know, it's all like the first and last, the first letter of their first name, last letter of their last name.
[437:15.05]So it was like Sean, like Harrison, like Andrew...
[437:23.74]Kennedy, right?
[437:24.86]It was like eight people.
[437:30.34]Talk to me.
[437:31.90]And there's yelled shit out there with apartment windows to each other.
[437:36.45]You know, it struck me that I've been around you for quite some time now, participating in your daily routines.
[437:44.67]However, I'm not quite sure exactly where we are.
[437:49.06]I'm guessing we are somewhere in America, but the details are fuzzy.
[437:54.19]Like you, Fuzzy.
[437:56.43]Anywho, I was wondering if you'd be so kind as to tell me which state we're residing in currently?
[438:05.27]Nevada.
[438:07.15]We live in the Silver State?
[438:11.18]Yes.
[438:12.92]That's a great nickname, but I'm assuming they don't exactly hand it out as you cross the state lines.
[438:19.82]Anyway, what big city are we nearest to?
[438:24.36]Las Vegas.
[438:26.46]Las Vegas, a monument to money and decadence.
[438:30.80]It's truly my kind of city.
[438:33.21]So do you gamble?
[438:37.73]Yes.
[438:39.19]I guess even if you live close by, the lure of possible instant riches is always strong.
[438:48.34]But not very much.
[438:51.28]no leave me alone only enough to have fun and never more than uh that would seem be ridiculous always moderate yourself and don't you go in there and try to have fun with a little bit of a little bit of money you don't blow all your money it's bad have a couple drinks maybe play like a few hands of blackjack maybe spin the roulette uh once and maybe like a like somewhere like a like minimum bet on a machine and then you go home
[439:28.19]And then before you go home, before the lift gets there, you cancel the lift and you turn back and you go to the ATM.
[439:35.43]Four times.
[439:38.61]No.
[439:39.23]Leave me alone.
[439:43.28]I'm just fucking kidding.
[439:44.26]Relax.
[439:44.44]I'll be seeing you.
[439:45.98]Let's talk.
[439:48.26]Let's talk.
[439:51.36]I must tell you that your country truly fascinates me.
[439:55.78]Here at the beginning of a new millennium, the most visible signs of change for America is that it continues to get stronger and more influential in the world.
[440:06.75]Yet for a country with so much influence, it's made up of so many disparate parts.
[440:14.34]You Westerners seem to live a life that's very different from the rest of the country.
[440:18.68]You're a Westerner too.
[440:19.50]Yet somehow everyone fits together.
[440:21.80]Colonial reachings have even brought places like Alaska and Hawaii into the fold.
[440:27.84]What will your future be like?
[440:30.16]Will there be 55 states in 100 years?
[440:33.48]Will there be no states at all?
[440:35.20]These are the things I think about.
[440:38.94]And I'm sure you have too.
[440:48.15]Alright, let's heat it up.
[440:49.45]Let's have a day go by.
[440:52.25]What's this guy thinking?
[440:52.89]Some kind of fucking improv comedian?
[440:54.35]You know what I mean?
[440:56.77]Like, snooze.
[440:57.96]I almost just hurt myself with the cord.
[441:12.69]No spiders?
[441:15.69]We are so close.
[441:17.81]It's almost time for the credits.
[441:19.31]They're going to evolve one more time, and then we're going to get to see what they do.
[441:26.94]Are you mentally stable?
[441:29.90]Well, the thing is, if you weren't here about seven and a half hours ago... Let me get to the right page.
[441:41.65]Of course I am.
[441:46.32]I had to do mental preparation before this frame started.
[441:50.06]So... Yeah.
[441:56.86]There's a spider in my Dreamcast.
[441:58.26]I might as well stop the Dreamcast then.
[442:13.63]Thanks for reading me.
[442:14.59]You're welcome.
[442:20.91]Alright.
[442:23.21]27, 28.
[442:24.95]Three more days.
[442:25.59]Then we can put the, uh, the book on this one forever.
[442:33.36]Until Seaman 3 comes out.
[442:41.08]Read this message.
[442:41.70]I'm a subscriber.
[442:44.60]I got you, see?
[442:57.61]Get a Japanese Dreamcast and play the second one?
[443:00.89]No.
[443:03.18]That would be a very expensive... That would be like 200 bucks just to play Seaman 2.
[443:10.90]Wouldn't it?
[443:15.31]Or a Japanese PlayStation 2?
[443:16.89]I don't have a region locked this too.
[443:21.47]It seems that visiting around this time has become a habit for you.
[443:26.87]Am I going to play Devil May Cry 5?
[443:28.25]First, a recap of your previous visit.
[443:31.01]The Cadmen have developed legs.
[443:38.00]At the moment, the habitat contains two Cadmen.
[443:45.34]They are suffering from the cold.
[443:47.70]Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[443:52.34]So let us head over to the tank.
[443:56.41]Too late, there was a third one?
[444:01.10]The third one got eaten already?
[444:02.84]No, there was two.
[444:06.32]They were two there.
[444:07.56]When we left, I think.
[444:13.65]Stream is still going?
[444:14.49]Yeah, we're gonna see the end.
[444:21.53]If you gotta go, you gotta go.
[444:23.03]But I wanna see how this plays out.
[444:34.70]It's cold, isn't it?
[444:39.39]You're going really late for the East Coast.
[444:41.05]Yeah, Andy, you, I know.
[444:43.27]It is late.
[444:45.63]It is late.
[444:54.64]Slow that down.
[445:03.11]I just got to work in the EU.
[445:04.83]What time is it in the EU?
[445:07.01]7am?
[445:07.53]8am?
[445:12.48]You got work tomorrow and it's 1am but fuck it.
[445:16.36]Take care of yourself.
[445:17.04]Make sure you don't cause yourself any problems, you know?
[445:20.90]Anybody see a spider?
[445:21.62]I do.
[445:27.55]He was right about to eat that egg too.
[445:34.53]Okay, let's continue.
[445:36.69]Hello.
[445:38.77]How are you?
[445:42.07]Hey.
[445:45.06]Yeah.
[445:48.28]What's up?
[445:51.40]How are you today?
[445:54.42]Hi there.
[445:54.96]Do you have any questions?
[445:59.33]Any questions?
[446:02.13]Any questions?
[446:05.54]Any questions?
[446:08.48]Look, I'm very busy.
[446:09.84]Can't this wait?
[446:14.86]Talk to me.
[446:19.40]Well, I found out a little about you based on where we live.
[446:23.99]Now I'm curious if you've learned anything about your fellow humans based on where they live.
[446:29.13]Okay.
[446:29.97]Tell me, have you ever traveled abroad?
[446:32.05]Does Canada count?
[446:36.16]Does Canada count?
[446:37.17]No.
[446:38.79]You know the expression about walking a mile in someone's shoes?
[446:43.89]Well, walking a mile in their country is the next best thing.
[446:48.29]What was that for?
[446:49.43]You have no idea how much you don't know about a person until you find out about their home.
[446:55.22]Humans always seem to play it too safe.
[446:58.20]They stay in their own little world instead of realizing that the world belongs to those that live in it.
[447:05.00]And if you don't travel it and learn about it, you're not really living in it, you see.
[447:11.02]Besides, nothing gets your love muffin in the mood for a more quite like an exotic trip.
[447:22.92]Sure.
[447:26.91]Sure.
[447:29.41]This better be good.
[447:32.89]Talk to me.
[447:34.80]Let's talk.
[447:38.18]I have another point to make regarding travel and culture.
[447:42.01]Shall I share it with you?
[447:44.67]Yes.
[447:46.11]Okay then.
[447:46.75]Whether or not you've traveled abroad, you're part of an ever-shrinking world.
[447:53.29]Sure, you know that.
[447:54.95]There's even a song about it being a small world after all, but never in history has it become so important to be familiar with and tolerant of other peoples and their cultures.
[448:07.80]you and your descendants will be forced to deal more and more with people from all over the world.
[448:14.28]Think of the effect that will have.
[448:16.64]Cultures will become further mixed.
[448:19.14]You already see that in small ways, like your pop music with musical styles being combined, in your food with fusion cuisine.
[448:29.11]It's a natural result of the world's economy becoming mixed, the prevalence of the internet, cheaper, faster travel,
[448:37.31]The end result will more likely be that there may be no more countries to speak of in the future.
[448:43.49]The world will be more of a cohesive unit, just as it happened in the United States and is already happening in Europe.
[448:51.71]That to me is very exciting.
[448:55.20]Exciting, okay.
[449:01.10]The globalists.
[449:05.17]Gentlemen, the globalists, let me tell you something.
[449:08.99]There's going to be a post-human, post-human apocalypse.
[449:11.51]I'm telling you, post-human.
[449:14.35]What's going to happen is the Seaman are going to come up here.
[449:21.00]I swear to God, the Seaman are going to come up.
[449:23.90]And they are going to totally, just absolutely wipe us out.
[449:26.86]And the globalists are going to take over with the Seaman.
[449:28.90]And then it goes real high.
[449:30.96]It goes real high, Joe.
[449:37.45]Talk to me.
[449:40.61]Well, until next time, bye.
[449:44.28]No, talk to me.
[449:44.96]I want to hear more.
[449:47.94]I want to hear more.
[449:50.22]I'm thinking.
[449:57.53]Roll credits.
[450:03.17]Hello?
[450:05.41]Yes.
[450:08.72]Talk to me.
[450:11.46]Talk to me.
[450:14.98]Fine, I'll go talk to your brother.
[450:18.30]Talk to me.
[450:21.22]Let's talk.
[450:24.37]Okay, let's talk about... No, maybe tomorrow.
[450:32.31]Tadpole dropping truth bombs.
[450:38.89]Fine, we'll talk tomorrow.
[450:50.96]Not very much time left.
[450:59.57]Tadpole politics.
[451:11.50]No, guys.
[451:12.92]Impressions are not politics.
[451:15.82]They're audio representations of what somebody sounds like.
[451:21.33]Okay?
[451:22.91]Just remember that.
[451:27.23]Everything, uh, clean?
[451:30.30]Yeah?
[451:35.84]Deadpool.
[451:36.42]Deadpool.
[451:41.96]Politics Andy?
[451:44.66]Did I just get called Politics Andy?
[451:46.64]I didn't do anything.
[451:47.46]I gotta fix this hair.
[451:50.28]It looks bad after eight hours.
[451:55.25]Politics Andy.
[451:56.23]I said like one sentence.
[452:07.95]Forehead window.
[452:08.95]What the fuck does that mean?
[452:11.56]I'm looking that up right now.
[452:33.61]There's nothing here.
[452:40.26]I have.
[452:42.68]Three days ago, a teacher told a student to wash off ash Wednesday on forehead.
[452:58.43]What the fuck are you talking about?
[452:59.71]Why do you keep saying this?
[453:06.83]That's all I could see on a Google result.
[453:12.63]Forehead window.
[453:13.48]That's what I typed in.
[453:57.20]Get bangs?
[453:57.98]You wanna see how fucking bad I look with bangs?
[454:19.58]Like, hey Scoob!
[455:01.76]How much have you ever lost over Qwintos?
[455:05.80]Could you step outside for me, sir?
[455:07.58]Could you step outside for me, sir?
[455:17.97]Peasant hair!
[455:19.97]Okay, that's good.
[455:21.36]That's really good peasant hair.
[455:29.71]This really is, this really is peasant here.
[455:38.73]Oh, my father and his farm upstate here.
[455:41.85]Did they, how did the farmer, no, how did the peasant talk?
[455:45.75]Uh, yes, me lord.
[455:47.93]Yes, right away, yes, right away, me lord.
[455:51.98]You go shovel that shit in the farmhouse.
[455:57.10]Yes, right away.
[455:57.90]Right away.
[455:59.36]Right away, me lord.
[456:07.69]God fucking damn it.
[456:09.11]That peasant here.
[456:12.23]I'm shaving it all off.
[456:13.09]It's all going to be gone tomorrow.
[456:18.90]Witcher 3 peasant NPC.
[456:25.87]Now it's all fucked up.
[456:26.96]No, I... Hey, that's better.
[456:31.34]No, it's not.
[456:33.78]Fucking peasant here.
[456:35.66]I'm gonna look in the mirror every day and just think of... I got like a pitchfork.
[456:40.46]Like a... A beige vest.
[456:51.27]Would you...
[456:55.55]I had to do the stupid fucking thing where I parted in the middle and did the no country for old men impression.
[457:05.42]Which sucked on its own.
[457:06.60]That was bad.
[457:07.50]Fuck the goddamn face cam.
[457:17.80]I'm never using it again.
[457:22.71]Would you like
[457:30.23]What would I look like actually completely bald?
[457:37.08]No, I can't do completely bald, guys.
[457:39.48]I'll look like a fucking goddamn random British henchman that gets punched in the face first in every Liam Neeson movie.
[457:47.02]I'm not doing it.
[458:05.36]Grow it out and braid it.
[458:06.54]No, I can't do that shit.
[458:26.42]Just buzz it.
[458:28.24]This link, this link.
[458:44.30]That looks fucking terrible.
[458:45.40]That was real bad.
[458:53.52]I'd rather get a toupee staple to my head than have that look.
[458:59.40]I got too rocky of a face for a bald head.
[459:10.43]I would rather you use horse glue.
[459:13.12]And just smear it on there.
[459:16.08]And just let it stay.
[459:21.06]3.29.
[459:21.10]Two more days!
[459:21.96]Let's go.
[459:33.69]Show a screen?
[459:34.37]Just wait.
[459:36.13]The longer that I lose concentration, the more terrible fucking ugly impressions you get.
[459:43.76]I don't want that.
[459:44.48]You don't want that.
[459:46.40]We both don't want that.
[459:57.31]I do.
[460:01.33]Is this a new shirt?
[460:02.99]No, I've had this for a while.
[460:12.80]Good evening.
[460:15.48]welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul gasset greetings and welcome back you're doing a good job two more days and that's it at the moment the habitat contains two yeah it's gone cadman I don't want to drink more than one they are suffering from the cold I drink like a coke maybe a couple of days I don't want to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level so let us head over to the tank
[460:51.71]I love how you're on a PST schedule.
[460:53.11]I appreciate seeing more of you every night.
[460:55.41]His streams have definitely been longer.
[461:01.35]You're looking extra bald today.
[461:10.21]I will 1v1 you in auto chess.
[461:14.16]And just show you up.
[461:18.30]And I ain't even ever played it.
[461:25.27]Have they grown?
[461:25.95]Not really.
[461:28.07]Hey.
[461:33.26]Oh goody.
[461:38.48]God, they're so ugly.
[461:42.01]All three of us or just them two?
[461:44.53]You gotta clarify that.
[461:46.45]After all this bullshit that lasts like 20 minutes.
[461:56.67]What secrets of the universe are we going to get after completing this finally?
[462:00.22]What was that?
[462:02.30]Oh, two hatchlings.
[462:29.67]I'll take him.
[462:30.01]Uh, I'll take you, please.
[462:35.12]Hello?
[462:41.78]Oh, why did... The face is just so fucked up.
[462:53.31]They lift their heads up and they just look so terrifying.
[463:00.61]Okay.
[463:01.87]Coming out on land now.
[463:02.93]They can come out on land.
[463:05.11]That's new.
[463:07.61]Talk to me.
[463:09.53]Let's get some more info.
[463:13.43]Hi.
[463:16.26]Let's talk.
[463:21.80]Hello.
[463:23.68]Are you listening?
[463:26.56]It's good to see you again.
[463:33.90]Are you gonna, like, Dead Space 2 on me here?
[463:39.82]Hello.
[463:41.82]Hello.
[463:44.68]Let's talk.
[463:49.09]Hey, I have something I want to talk to you about.
[463:51.93]Okay.
[463:53.05]You know, I'm really getting the impression that you people are busy all the time.
[463:59.29]Maybe it's just here in America, which is such a business-obsessed culture.
[464:04.75]It seems like everyone is always complaining about not having any spare time, but when they get some, they don't know what to do with it because they're so used to being busy.
[464:15.72]It's strange that knowing how to relax appears to have become a skill you humans have to learn.
[464:23.10]The same thing.
[464:44.37]Play video games.
[464:45.99]When I ask you something, I expect an answer.
[464:49.21]You know, let us revisit my last inquiry to you.
[464:53.97]That is, if you can cooperate this time.
[464:58.24]Kill the globalist frog.
[465:00.46]What do you do when you're with your friends?
[465:06.30]Play video games.
[465:08.58]Hold on, I've got the worst gas.
[465:13.42]Give me a second.
[465:18.95]What?
[465:20.67]Hello?
[465:22.59]Is he alright?
[465:30.72]Are you okay?
[465:36.56]Are you okay?
[465:45.71]Hello?
[465:47.71]Yeah, hello.
[465:49.73]Are you okay?
[465:53.24]Let me repeat the question.
[465:55.42]I said... Hey, I have something I want to talk to you about.
[466:01.20]You know, I'm really getting the impression that you people are busy all the time.
[466:07.45]Maybe it's just here in America, which is such a business-obsessed culture.
[466:12.90]It seems like everyone is always complaining about not having any spare time, but when they get some, they don't know what to do with it because they're so used to being busy.
[466:23.87]It's strange that knowing how to relax appears to have become a skill you humans have to learn.
[466:31.26]You seem to know how to relax if you're talking to me, but I want to know what else you do in your spare time.
[466:39.05]For example, what do you do when you're with your friends?
[466:44.03]Play video games.
[466:46.43]Like to toss a few back with friends, huh?
[466:49.19]Yeah.
[466:49.63]I guess I don't really understand why you humans are so interested in destroying your precious brain cells.
[466:57.06]Just out of curiosity, why do you like to drink?
[467:04.18]Because it's fun.
[467:06.60]I see.
[467:07.86]Then the fun starts during the prolonged vomiting into a garbage can.
[467:13.28]You're implying that I drink, or drink, like 15 beers when I drink.
[467:20.95]No, you drink a few drinks, you have some fun conversation, maybe you do something fun, and that's it.
[467:30.39]Why would you say, okay, yeah, I like to drink.
[467:33.07]I like to go and have a few drinks with friends.
[467:34.60]It's fun.
[467:36.54]You're puking.
[467:39.62]Where did you get the, I don't know where you got that from.
[467:42.04]Talk to me.
[467:47.72]So, I think I have an idea of what activities you and your friends do in your time together.
[467:54.34]Do you see a lot of them, by the way?
[467:58.03]Ah, not anymore.
[467:59.65]He's moving.
[468:00.41]I'm gonna say yes, though.
[468:01.73]Yes.
[468:02.63]So I see him.
[468:03.03]Talk to me.
[468:03.52]People love to talk.
[468:20.68]Oh sure, there are quiet ones every once in a while, but usually if you ask a person the right questions, they can go on for hours.
[468:29.74]I mean, why else would you have me around if you didn't like a good conversation every once in a while?
[468:36.95]I think that's also what makes a good friend, if they're willing to listen to you spout off about something.
[468:44.19]You just have to make sure you let them talk once in a while too, so you don't bore them to death.
[468:51.02]But I was wondering, what kinds of things do you and your friends talk about?
[469:07.71]Speaking of answers, what's yours?
[469:09.01]Okay, I've been waiting patiently for you to think about my last question.
[469:11.93]Can you give me the answer, please?
[469:12.87]You've forgotten, haven't you?
[469:13.69]Okay, then again.
[469:14.17]But I was wondering, what kinds of things do you and your friends talk about?
[469:38.31]Oh, you movie buffs.
[469:42.77]That's great that you can share a common interest like that, though.
[469:47.48]Movie buffs are a lot like literary buffs.
[469:50.70]They like to pick apart the things they love and get as much out of them as possible.
[469:56.18]The only drawback is it might be harder to appreciate these things once you start dissecting them.
[470:02.31]I'm sure you know all about that, though.
[470:05.25]I say you can never really get bored if you have someone around who you can talk to.
[470:11.37]Sometimes it's more fun to just sit around and talk than it is to actually go do something.
[470:18.90]It all depends on the person though.
[470:25.44]Talk to me.
[470:32.52]Say, I know you spend time socializing with your friends a lot, but you have to have some time left over to spend with your sweetheart, right?
[470:42.95]It's good to be in a relationship that's a friendship also.
[470:47.39]You can kill two birds with one stone.
[470:50.75]Besides, I don't know why you'd want to be with someone who bores the pants off you.
[470:56.92]So what do you and your girlfriend like to do together?
[471:10.63]You know what?
[471:12.05]Seaman doesn't want to know this.
[471:14.43]Just keep it to yourself.
[471:16.35]Well, I'm sure you and your sweetie care about each other.
[471:20.12]But if you don't mind me saying so, I think you may have worked yourself into some kind of rut.
[471:26.72]Maybe you should think about getting out more, exploring your world, that sort of thing.
[471:32.00]I didn't say anything.
[471:32.82]Who knows?
[471:33.80]Maybe you don't need anything except each other.
[471:37.01]Go jogging!
[471:38.15]Nah, get out and do something before you drive each other crazy.
[471:42.89]Why are you playing facade?
[471:43.89]This is the original facade.
[471:48.86]Alright, how's the tank?
[471:58.64]One of them's dying.
[472:08.35]The question is who.
[472:21.68]Why am I so slow to respond?
[472:25.64]What do you mean slow to respond?
[472:37.85]What are you guys doing?
[472:40.25]What are you guys doing?
[472:43.21]Yes?
[472:44.79]What are you two doing?
[472:45.91]You know what the really great thing about friends is?
[472:49.41]Spending time with them makes you really appreciate the time you spend by yourself.
[472:54.62]I mean, you probably get tired of your friends sometimes, don't you?
[472:59.00]What do you like to do when you're by yourself?
[473:07.94]What is this guy doing right now?
[473:11.91]This one's freaking me out.
[473:38.77]You guys are just too close.
[473:39.91]Move out of the way.
[473:47.32]Alright.
[473:51.78]How we doing over here?
[473:54.91]We look alright.
[473:56.43]Got a couple more eggs.
[473:59.99]Another day.
[474:25.44]What's the goal of this game?
[474:27.62]To raise a tadpole into a frog who eventually implants chips into all humans' brains and forces them to build the pyramids.
[474:38.86]Well, those are the new pyramids.
[474:40.44]That's all they care about.
[474:57.23]3.30.
[474:57.25]20 days, exactly almost 3 weeks.
[475:09.74]This is a lot of passive-aggressive mannerisms to deal with in one night.
[475:18.21]That's the designer's face in the game.
[475:23.37]That's actually... That's really funny.
[475:35.89]Good evening.
[475:38.58]Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[475:41.02]Any changes, Leonard?
[475:44.32]Greetings, and welcome back.
[475:46.84]You're doing a good job.
[475:51.59]Let's see.
[475:53.07]Last time, the tad men are now closer in appearance to frogs rather than tadpoles.
[475:59.85]Let us then call them frogmen.
[476:02.34]Frogmen.
[476:05.02]That's actually awesome.
[476:06.12]Frogmen.
[476:06.32]To frogmen.
[476:06.98]So what, um... What's the final evolution, then?
[476:08.84]Do they go from frogmen to lizards?
[476:11.52]What do they go into?
[476:35.48]Birds?
[476:38.76]They don't turn into humans.
[476:39.94]No, they don't.
[476:45.74]They turn into birds.
[476:49.11]Tadpole, frog, eagle.
[477:02.60]Turn up the heat.
[477:04.68]Oh, goody.
[477:19.40]I'm feeling a little peckish.
[477:21.46]Could you feed me?
[477:23.34]Now they want to eat.
[477:25.16]Okay, I got plenty of food.
[477:28.41]I actually have food for the next at least ten days.
[477:31.03]This will be good.
[477:34.97]You eat this shit, right?
[477:35.79]What if they didn't eat these anymore?
[477:39.44]Someone over here wants to eat.
[477:41.74]There you go.
[477:43.88]Go get it.
[477:58.30]Hello?
[477:59.48]Food?
[478:02.90]They don't eat these.
[478:10.63]They eat the moths.
[478:12.27]No, they don't.
[478:12.75]He's going over there right now.
[478:21.29]Okay.
[478:21.51]That was a Campbell's soup reference.
[478:25.97]I think I need some food.
[478:28.21]Instead of one bite, they take a whole thing.
[478:34.11]So.
[478:34.88]Hello.
[478:35.74]Hello.
[478:36.78]Are you listening?
[478:37.92]I am.
[478:38.96]How are you?
[478:45.26]Let's talk.
[478:47.56]Have any questions?
[478:52.95]Bonjour.
[479:00.07]Talk to me.
[479:05.49]One thing I find really interesting about people is how very chameleon-like many of you can be.
[479:13.57]For example, when a person is talking to their closest friends, as opposed to their employer, their entire persona will often change.
[479:22.83]Of course, it really depends on the person.
[479:25.41]I mean, you seem to do different things around people than when you're by yourself, and that leads me to ask you, depending on who you're with, do you think your personality changes a lot, a little, or not at all?
[479:40.56]A little.
[479:41.58]A little.
[479:43.54]I think that's pretty common.
[479:45.80]People adapt to the situations around them.
[479:49.12]Often, the way you act around your grocery store clerk won't necessitate quite as much ass-kissing as when you're around people you owe money to.
[479:57.91]The things you do with different people and when you're alone reflect your personality changes, I think.
[480:04.67]I mean, it seems like there's a lot of things going on with you.
[480:08.79]No wonder you act differently around different people.
[480:12.44]It seems like you're doing lots of different things around them too.
[480:17.10]Well, I think I know you well enough to tell you that even I act differently depending on who I'm with, and it makes sense.
[480:25.99]Everyone has different expectations of everyone else, and nobody expects me to pick my nose around them.
[480:33.17]Yes, that is my private moment.
[480:36.13]Don't tell anyone.
[480:37.43]Hey, thanks for the food.
[480:39.79]It gets really tough for us when the air gets too dry.
[480:43.90]There should be a sprinkler that Gasset built somewhere around here.
[480:47.62]Hey, can you use the D-pad to look for it?
[480:52.04]Come on, use the D-pad and find the sprinkler.
[480:55.33]I'm using the D-pad.
[480:57.03]What do you mean?
[480:57.51]It's the sprinkler.
[480:58.41]Hey, I'm trying to sleep in here.
[481:08.15]There.
[481:09.20]That better?
[481:11.66]Put the light out or I'll put yours out.
[481:15.10]Jesus fucking okay.
[481:16.36]Oh my god.
[481:18.26]Talk to me.
[481:22.86]Let's talk.
[481:25.66]That's my name.
[481:26.66]Don't wear it out.
[481:27.64]What is this?
[481:28.12]I don't even know what the name is.
[481:29.63]Greg?
[481:30.39]Hey, Greg.
[481:30.79]Greg.
[481:34.23]Greg.
[481:37.30]That's a terrifying image.
[481:39.62]Let's talk.
[481:40.08]Talk to me.
[481:40.36]Didn't I cancel this already?
[482:07.15]For example, when a person is talking to their closest friends, as opposed to their employer, their entire persona will often change.
[482:16.42]Of course, it really depends on the person.
[482:18.98]I mean, you seem to do different things around people than when you're by yourself, and that leads me to ask you, depending on who you're with, do you think your personality changes a lot, a little, or not at all?
[482:34.47]A little.
[482:36.55]I think that's pretty common.
[482:38.82]People adapt to the situations around them.
[482:42.10]Often, the way you act around your grocery store clerk won't necessitate quite as much ass kissing as when you're around people you owe money to.
[482:50.70]The things you do with different people and when you're alone reflect your personality changes, I think.
[482:57.47]I mean, it seems like there's a lot of things going on with you.
[483:01.59]No wonder you act differently around different people.
[483:05.23]It seems like you're doing lots of different things around them too.
[483:09.87]Well, I think I know you well enough to tell you that even I act differently depending on who I'm with and it makes sense.
[483:18.76]Everyone has different expectations of everyone else and nobody expects me to pick my nose around them.
[483:25.95]Yes, that is my private moment.
[483:28.89]Don't tell anyone, please.
[483:30.91]Anyway, I'm going to go think about things for a while.
[483:34.93]It was nice talking with you.
[483:36.83]Bye.
[483:38.21]Bye.
[483:38.79]Hey, bye.
[483:42.19]Why don't you go do something more intellectually stimulating like eat paint chips?
[483:50.07]You're dead.
[483:50.47]Don't worry.
[483:51.88]Talk to me.
[483:53.98]Talk to me.
[483:56.04]Hey, Greg.
[484:02.90]What do you need?
[484:05.60]Talk to me.
[484:06.52]I see you out there moving from place to place, and sometimes I am envious of your freedom.
[484:13.46]There are so many things you can do.
[484:16.40]I can imagine what it must be like to be so free.
[484:20.13]It's weird how familiar it seems.
[484:23.75]You must get a lot of exercise running around as you do.
[484:27.65]So with all that moving about, do you think you're in pretty good shape?
[484:32.74]No.
[484:34.26]You think you're in pretty bad shape, is that right?
[484:38.06]Yeah.
[484:40.76]Hmm, I thought you really liked your body.
[484:45.37]Maybe you've just really let yourself go recently, or maybe you just like your body despite being out of shape.
[484:53.06]I mean, it's not like round is necessarily a bad shape.
[484:57.43]No, that's not what I mean.
[484:58.89]You know, circles are round and...
[485:01.99]They're great.
[485:03.68]It's hard to say whether or not someone is in good shape.
[485:07.12]It seems like your TV and magazines tell you what it means to be fit, but that idea of fitness can be pretty unrealistic.
[485:17.13]On the other hand, it's pretty safe to say that a little physical activity will make you fitter than just sitting around on your butt and eating potato chips.
[485:27.07]You don't seem really satisfied with your level of fitness.
[485:31.35]I don't even like potato chips.
[485:37.47]Talk to me.
[485:39.15]Anything else?
[485:39.83]Talk to me.
[485:45.80]What's up?
[485:48.02]Are we good with the sprinklers?
[485:49.12]It seems strange to me that with all the wonderful things you can do with your bodies, there are still people out there who are out of shape.
[485:57.43]People are busy!
[485:58.25]Nothing.
[486:26.18]Nothing?
[486:27.42]Really?
[486:27.84]Yeah.
[486:30.84]So I guess you must not really care what kind of shape you're in.
[486:35.60]Not really.
[486:36.84]Well, friend, you seem to be a classic case of cause and effect.
[486:41.90]No exercise, no fitness.
[486:45.14]Who knows?
[486:46.08]Maybe you have a perfect body and are just completely delusional, but something tells me that if you exercised a little, you might feel better about yourself.
[486:56.68]I guess I'll have to keep asking you questions and see what else I can find out about you.
[487:01.46]Hmm, number one?
[487:08.66]No, no, it's definitely number two.
[487:16.06]Alright, time for the final day.
[487:24.31]Good night.
[487:25.11]Oh, jeez.
[487:25.77]See what happens when you... Just roast this smug asshole?
[487:37.88]I need to see the final thing.
[487:44.34]We're almost at one of the last... This is the last day.
[487:46.46]There's apparently only... Somebody said there's two question sets left and that's it.
[487:52.88]What you need to know, I'm going to be the only person who's ever beaten C-Man on stream.
[487:58.76]On original console, no save stating, no fast forwards, no, no.
[488:04.84]Only person on Twitch to have beat it with real original hardware on stream.
[488:14.52]I got original shit here.
[488:22.61]Oh, that's right.
[488:27.17]Would you like to save and end the session?
[488:45.70]You know what I mean, though.
[488:47.86]No, uh...
[488:52.12]You know what I mean.
[489:05.83]I'm leaving the goddamn person on this whole site.
[489:22.28]The only fucking person on this side that probably owns one of these.
[489:26.95]I might be the only person on the internet that still has one.
[489:31.01]Do you have one?
[489:35.35]You got one of these?
[489:37.60]With original microphone?
[489:39.64]That was probably up somebody's ass?
[489:45.48]By the way, isn't this supposed to have like a thing up here?
[489:49.74]There's supposed to be a little puffball.
[489:53.12]Good evening.
[489:55.82]Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[490:01.44]Greetings, and welcome back.
[490:03.46]Three weeks.
[490:03.98]You're doing a good job.
[490:08.64]Very well.
[490:10.16]Ah, you can now use the sprinkler.
[490:13.35]Frogman is sensitive to dryness, so you must use the sprinkler frequently.
[490:19.86]Is this for PS4?
[490:20.78]It is not.
[490:22.16]This is only for Dreamcast.
[490:22.97]At the moment, the habitat contains two frogmen.
[490:30.27]They are suffering from the cold.
[490:32.63]Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[490:37.29]So let us head over to the tank.
[490:40.81]Yeah, I'm missing the puffball.
[490:43.17]I'm so ashamed that I put this thing in my mouth and pretend up my nose.
[490:54.67]We're in the final set of questions.
[490:57.69]Somebody said three and a half K viewers at midnight PST.
[491:04.17]Yeah, that's actually kind of crazy.
[491:07.01]There's a lot of people that are still here.
[491:09.46]But you're seeing it through like I am.
[491:15.72]Hey.
[491:17.88]Thanks for sticking around.
[491:26.07]Can someone out there put on a sprinkler for me?
[491:29.45]There's not enough moisture here.
[491:31.27]I need a little mist here.
[491:34.14]It's too dry.
[491:36.40]How about turning up the heat?
[491:39.38]Give me something to eat.
[491:45.16]Turn the heat up.
[491:46.22]Give me something to eat.
[491:48.18]Mist my body.
[491:48.98]Give me something to eat.
[491:55.30]Yes, my prince.
[491:57.36]Anything for you, my prince.
[491:59.60]Hey, can you give me something to eat?
[492:02.61]Could you put the heater on for me?
[492:06.43]You know those things each take time.
[492:09.51]More than ten seconds.
[492:12.33]Could you put the heater on for me?
[492:16.41]I'm really hungry.
[492:18.19]Please feed me.
[492:19.86]I'm kind of hungry.
[492:23.38]I sure could go for a bite to eat.
[492:25.34]Alright.
[492:26.66]Let's get some food in here.
[492:27.58]Is that one dead?
[492:37.13]I command you to feed me.
[492:40.29]It's like manna from heaven.
[492:43.94]You are such a little dick.
[492:54.40]Imagine being commanded to feed somebody.
[493:03.65]I command you to feed me.
[493:06.25]Hey, thanks for the food.
[493:08.17]No, my items can be placed here.
[493:10.95]Why not?
[493:13.11]What?
[493:18.75]So full.
[493:22.79]Oh, shit.
[493:23.17]There's a web.
[493:24.49]Oh, fuck it.
[493:24.99]Who cares?
[493:26.51]We have so much food.
[493:29.95]We have so much food and we're done.
[493:34.84]Right?
[493:35.04]Because I need to bring this over, though.
[493:43.92]How can I pick anything up?
[493:44.70]I got it right here.
[493:54.43]Can the frog eat, uh... The frog, I think, if it eats the spider, will get sick.
[494:04.04]Food over here?
[494:11.34]Kill the spider.
[494:12.30]I can't.
[494:14.00]Well, now I can.
[494:14.88]If he eats, I can kill the spider.
[494:19.31]Right there.
[494:19.73]Eat it.
[494:22.19]Eat that bug.
[494:24.98]Hey, you.
[494:26.80]You talking to me or talking to him?
[494:29.08]Go eat the... What do you want?
[494:34.24]Hi.
[494:36.32]Don't you ever go out on the weekend?
[494:38.74]Hey, thanks.
[494:42.55]They want to know such mundane information.
[494:50.79]That hit the spot.
[494:51.91]They've both been fed.
[494:52.47]Let's go kill the spider.
[495:00.56]They won't eat this, right?
[495:01.48]They've both eaten.
[495:03.00]They shouldn't.
[495:08.69]Yeah, we gotta get plenty of food processing here.
[495:13.23]Talk to me!
[495:22.76]Yes?
[495:36.90]Oh, what are you doing?
[495:39.08]Crunchy.
[495:39.74]Why did you eat that?
[495:40.70]It's dead.
[495:41.00]I don't care.
[495:42.16]No, wait.
[495:42.46]Did they have to procreate?
[495:46.90]Why?
[495:47.20]He already ate.
[495:48.25]It said if they eat, they're not hungry, they won't eat it, and it'll die.
[495:53.35]Oh, God.
[496:00.57]I love you.
[496:04.60]I'm illin.
[496:06.08]I love you.
[496:06.58]Yes, I am.
[496:07.40]I love you.
[496:08.83]Ooh, I think I'm going to lose my lunch, if you know what I mean.
[496:15.13]I love you.
[496:15.91]I love you.
[496:19.59]I'm illin.
[496:21.51]Yes, I am.
[496:25.56]I'm really not feeling good.
[496:30.14]I love you.
[496:30.52]I love you.
[496:34.13]I'm illin.
[496:36.05]Yes, I am.
[496:36.49]All we need is one.
[496:41.84]Talk to me.
[496:44.50]Let's talk.
[496:45.08]I can't believe you ate the fucking spider.
[496:50.16]You know, I'm really fascinated by health clubs and gyms, these huge places full of fancy equipment and open spaces where you can run around.
[497:01.47]And you have to actually pay to belong to one, when in the past you could just pick any field and run around in it to your heart's content.
[497:11.21]Or you'd get so muscular and fit from all the manual labor you'd have to do that you wouldn't need a special place and time just to exercise.
[497:20.60]But I guess the world you live in gives you no other choice.
[497:23.64]So tell me, do you belong to a health club?
[497:25.86]So even though you know you could be more fit, you don't want to take the plunge and join a gym?
[497:39.89]It might help, although I guess I can see your hesitation.
[497:44.61]They offer a lot of different activities in one convenient place, but I just can't help but think a human being might want to do something more natural, like play a sport or even jog outside than be hooked up in a stinky gymnasium with a bunch of machines.
[498:01.71]I like to hit balls in the cages.
[498:03.85]That's how I like to work out nowadays when I haven't done it in about a year.
[498:07.91]But, you know, that's what I used to like to do.
[498:10.81]Let's talk.
[498:17.92]It seems like there are a lot of different things to keep in mind when you're trying to stay in shape.
[498:24.65]Exercising is one of them, but eating right is also very important, especially where you live.
[498:32.08]There's no shortage of food here.
[498:34.52]Well, for most people.
[498:36.36]And it's very easy to eat too much of the wrong thing, it seems.
[498:41.02]No wonder so many people have problems with their weight.
[498:44.64]Would you say that for the most part you eat a pretty healthy diet?
[498:49.64]Yes.
[498:51.27]You do eat healthy?
[498:53.65]Yes.
[498:55.29]You must really chow down on the vegetables then.
[498:59.31]What's your favorite one?
[499:01.97]Uh, probably carrots.
[499:03.59]Carrots.
[499:05.31]Carrots, huh?
[499:07.27]Good as a vegetable.
[499:08.91]Even better as a snowman's nose.
[499:11.27]So versatile.
[499:13.07]It's a shame that the things that are good for you don't usually taste as good as the bad ones.
[499:19.33]And you know what?
[499:20.39]The junk food marketers know it.
[499:23.11]So my advice is, beat the system.
[499:26.95]Eat a pound of broccoli.
[499:32.30]I was pressed for time, and I had to do it.
[499:34.65]I was pressed for time.
[499:36.33]Drinking a fucking coke and eating a whole pizza.
[499:41.53]I ain't very healthy.
[499:44.67]Let's talk.
[499:46.42]Is he dead yet?
[499:52.86]Oh, he's getting so red.
[499:56.70]Oh god.
[499:57.89]This is actually really sad.
[500:00.85]I love you.
[500:03.45]I love you.
[500:08.31]I'm illin'.
[500:10.25]Yes, I am.
[500:13.19]Ooh, I think I'm going to lose my lunch, if you know what I mean.
[500:19.53]I'm illin'.
[500:20.29]Yes, I am.
[500:20.59]Feel better.
[500:34.55]I am not.
[500:37.17]I love you.
[500:40.02]Oh, I really don't feel very well.
[500:43.88]I love you.
[500:46.30]I'm ill.
[500:47.14]We've done it enough times.
[500:48.22]Yes, I am.
[500:51.62]Let's talk.
[500:53.68]I feel sick.
[501:01.29]Let's talk.
[501:03.69]End this and go to bed?
[501:04.95]No, I can't get this far.
[501:07.39]Eight and a half hours into a stream and not see the end of this.
[501:11.86]Let's talk.
[501:15.06]Greg.
[501:17.08]Cheerio.
[501:19.06]Talk to me.
[501:21.28]Talk to me.
[501:29.06]You know, I've never been to a place that's as diet-obsessed as America.
[501:35.07]It seems like nobody wants to stay healthy the hard way, to actually exercise and eat right.
[501:42.38]Instead, people are always looking for a quick and easy way to lose a bunch of weight.
[501:48.02]As if they're just automatically going to stay healthy after the diet is over.
[501:52.33]Right.
[501:53.05]It looks like you take pretty regular care of yourself anyway, but have you ever been on a diet?
[502:00.73]Wait, hold on.
[502:01.41]That's... No.
[502:03.45]Not in that context.
[502:04.11]Maybe that's for the best.
[502:07.06]It looks like you're already trying to straighten out your health without resorting to lose weight quick schemes.
[502:14.38]No.
[502:17.38]Talk to me.
[502:20.71]I was thinking earlier about how interested your culture is in sports.
[502:25.77]I would say even obsessed sometimes.
[502:27.91]Do you like baseball, football, soccer?
[502:30.23]It can really get out of hand, but now that we're talking about health and staying fit, it almost doesn't seem like such a bad thing.
[502:39.03]That is, if you're actually playing a sport and not sitting in front of a TV and watching someone else play it.
[502:45.71]Tell me, what's your favorite sport to play?
[502:48.20]Um, Brady.
[502:49.60]Baseball.
[502:51.28]You play baseball?
[502:53.96]Yes.
[502:55.94]I bet you just like wearing those tight little pants.
[503:00.22]I think I understand why people want to play sports.
[503:05.23]It must be fun to see what you can make your body do if you just try a little.
[503:11.13]And you also get to hang out with other people and test your skills against theirs.
[503:17.53]I guess I still think some people can get too interested in sports, especially if it interferes with the mental stimulation they get.
[503:26.29]As with most things, balance is the key.
[503:31.08]What are you guys saying?
[503:31.90]There's a fly in your room flying around your face?
[503:34.06]What are you talking about?
[503:36.90]Oh, fuck.
[503:41.19]Hold on.
[503:41.55]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[503:45.07]Pretend you didn't just... Somebody just joined the stream.
[503:58.22]Remember, watch out, there's a fly.
[504:00.39]I don't see a fly.
[504:01.01]What are you talking about?
[504:03.31]Fucking whatever.
[504:04.63]Talk to me.
[504:06.11]Talk to me.
[504:07.79]Talk to me.
[504:10.72]Let's talk.
[504:13.10]Let's talk.
[504:15.40]What do you mean, here it comes?
[504:16.64]What is he doing?
[504:19.72]Here it comes.
[504:24.02]Did he just throw shit at me?
[504:26.16]He just threw shit at my screen!
[504:39.49]Get well soon.
[504:40.25]Oh, I really don't feel very well.
[504:46.07]Get well soon.
[504:48.63]I'm illin'.
[504:50.55]Yes, I am.
[504:54.39]Let's talk.
[504:57.01]Oh, I really don't feel very well.
[504:59.33]No, not hitting you.
[505:01.17]Greg, let's talk.
[505:04.22]Fine.
[505:05.32]You're a pain in the ass.
[505:07.04]How's that?
[505:11.18]Wow, now that's dark.
[505:15.58]Can you turn the light on?
[505:22.57]Hey, turn on the light.
[505:25.88]Ah, it's too bright.
[505:30.94]Talk to me.
[505:35.34]I was thinking earlier about sports and how popular they are here.
[505:40.60]As I was saying, it would be really great for the collective health of the country if everyone played sports, but it doesn't do so much for you to just sit and watch them.
[505:53.01]League of Legends.
[506:08.89]Well, you're a rare specimen.
[506:11.40]You play sports, but you don't follow the pros.
[506:14.82]It's definitely the healthier way to go.
[506:19.04]Anyhow, thanks for playing.
[506:21.68]Cloud 9 will win again.
[506:30.79]Talk to me.
[506:32.97]Talk to me.
[506:35.27]Talk to me.
[506:40.23]I've been asking you a lot about your health, and it seems that working out and eating right are two big components of it all, along with getting plenty of sleep, sex, two of my favorite things.
[506:55.68]But it seems that your human body is still so delicate.
[507:00.84]All the working out and dieting in the world can't make sure that something won't just go wrong anyway.
[507:07.76]That's where your physicians come in.
[507:10.24]Do you go to the doctor regularly?
[507:13.10]Literally was there, like, fucking very, very recently.
[507:17.43]Yes.
[507:19.01]That's to your benefit.
[507:21.19]Besides, it's another excuse to get naked.
[507:25.52]My, I am behaving saucily today, aren't I?
[507:29.76]Human beings are very lucky to have figured out how to heal themselves when they get sick.
[507:36.12]No other creature can do that.
[507:37.91]It's easy to take all your medical knowledge for granted, but think about it.
[507:45.14]If you were living even several hundred years ago, you'd still be putting leeches on yourself whenever you got a cold.
[507:53.86]Not that leeches are such a bad thing, but they're not exactly what I would call good medicine.
[508:00.65]Anyway, I'm glad to know that if something goes wrong with you, there's somebody that can help you out.
[508:11.45]Your brother is over there suffering.
[508:14.43]I don't know what to do about him.
[508:17.52]Talk to me.
[508:18.12]Talk to me.
[508:25.29]Like I was saying earlier, it's important to go to the doctor every once in a while, but it seems like it's not always so easy to do, since healthcare can be so expensive.
[508:37.98]I'm fascinated by this idea of health insurance.
[508:42.04]Well, actually, I find it a little sad.
[508:45.32]You humans are so sure that someday you're going to get sick that you actually put money away, especially for that time.
[508:54.02]Yes.
[508:54.26]No.
[508:54.36]But I do have a lot of health problems.
[508:56.41]I don't really get, like, a cold, but I get a shitload of health problems.
[509:36.06]I think he's dead.
[509:36.46]You good?
[509:39.46]You good?
[509:39.76]Get well soon.
[509:42.52]Don't come over here and eat him.
[510:00.10]This is poisoned meat.
[510:01.46]Don't... Don't do it.
[510:03.08]Don't do it.
[510:04.63]Don't stick that fucking elephant trunk into this.
[510:07.61]It starts sucking.
[510:08.75]Don't do it.
[510:10.21]Bad idea.
[510:10.77]Oh, don't do it.
[510:17.65]Okay, good.
[510:26.69]Alright.
[510:27.79]Goodbye.
[510:29.22]Who turned on the lights?
[510:31.54]Another day.
[510:35.64]Still got plenty of food.
[510:36.62]Our food supply is doing good.
[510:39.64]No more spider.
[510:40.40]We should have another larva tomorrow.
[510:46.20]Let's go.
[510:59.98]How can I be expected to sleep when this nightmare is on?
[511:14.67]One more day.
[511:19.75]Is it my bedtime yet?
[511:21.81]No, I'm just going.
[511:25.77]Wait a minute, 3-31.
[511:27.29]Oh shit, we're going into April.
[511:30.13]Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, go back.
[511:35.39]We're going into April 1st.
[511:36.23]4-1-2019.
[511:36.33]That's correct, right?
[511:41.58]31, yeah.
[511:54.68]I'm going until I see the credits.
[512:12.91]He doesn't know?
[512:14.05]What?
[512:17.45]No, I was explicitly told that we only had a couple more sequences left.
[512:32.62]Good evening.
[512:35.24]Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[512:40.96]Greetings and welcome back.
[512:43.48]You're doing a good job.
[512:47.21]At the moment, the habitat contains two frogmen.
[512:54.99]Seaman has become ill after eating a spider.
[512:58.51]Please take good care of him.
[513:00.67]Some kind words of encouragement may help him feel better.
[513:04.47]So let us head over to the tank.
[513:08.80]Alright, this says 25 hours, but what you have to understand is one person, only one person reported this.
[513:26.55]So that's it.
[513:34.77]One guy probably left his Dreamcast on for 10 hours.
[513:41.89]He left 5 hours ago and this guy's still streaming this game.
[513:45.13]Laughing my ass off.
[513:53.38]So how long is the game if you cheat?
[513:54.80]I don't know.
[513:57.69]I have no idea.
[514:03.04]Hey, why don't you turn on the sprinkler?
[514:05.84]Hey, why don't you turn on the sprinkler?
[514:08.82]I need a little mist here.
[514:10.72]It's too dry.
[514:12.34]A moist seawater.
[514:14.06]How you doing?
[514:16.24]Can't you help me?
[514:17.40]It's cold in here.
[514:19.08]Mmm, just like my Harlem days.
[514:30.34]Thanks for the moisture.
[514:41.24]See that gray square thing in the back corner?
[514:44.26]That's a heater.
[514:46.08]It's about time.
[514:52.59]In the lore, Seaman species are omnipotent messengers of the gods.
[514:56.09]The eggs come from Egypt, which is maybe why they have a thing for the pyramids.
[515:00.47]I see.
[515:02.23]Why don't you give me something to eat?
[515:05.50]Do you eat if you're sick?
[515:08.86]It's gonna be too hot.
[515:10.79]I didn't stop the wheel fast enough.
[515:14.59]Ah, maybe I did.
[515:16.33]No, I didn't.
[515:16.71]Okay, let's see.
[515:18.55]Food.
[515:18.87]How are we doing?
[515:19.39]Spiders?
[515:20.31]I don't see any.
[515:27.00]There are... Ooh.
[515:27.70]I'm going to leave that one.
[515:31.10]That one looks cool.
[515:31.82]That one's getting big and fat.
[515:34.50]A little chow, please.
[515:36.98]Come over here.
[515:40.37]He can't move, though.
[515:41.88]Can he not?
[515:42.38]I don't think I can feed him.
[515:44.84]I can't drop it over here.
[515:49.28]How is he going to get better?
[515:52.46]I'm not sure I can feed this one.
[516:08.41]Okay.
[516:09.79]That hit the spot.
[516:11.82]Good to hear.
[516:12.44]Let's take another fresh one over there.
[516:18.00]No thanks, I'm not hungry now.
[516:21.10]What?
[516:23.38]Are you hungry?
[516:25.86]Maybe I could eat a little antacid, but that's it.
[516:29.74]I really don't know what I ate that made me this way.
[516:32.38]You don't want it then?
[516:34.99]Did I seriously just waste this?
[516:41.55]Damn it.
[516:43.07]Let's talk.
[516:45.79]Oh, I really don't feel very well.
[516:50.23]Greg, come here.
[516:54.43]Hello.
[516:56.05]Talk to me.
[516:56.37]Are you listening?
[516:58.03]Talk to me.
[516:59.81]Yes, let's talk.
[517:03.37]Good evening.
[517:07.88]Hi.
[517:09.18]Okay, I've got something to tell you.
[517:11.40]See, I've been lying to you all this time.
[517:14.35]I'm actually Regis Philbin, and if you kiss me, I'll become human again and give you a million dollars.
[517:22.17]April Fool's.
[517:24.07]Oh, April Fool's.
[517:25.23]You believed me, didn't you?
[517:26.49]That's why.
[517:28.80]Quick.
[517:29.76]Help.
[517:30.58]There's a shark in here.
[517:31.90]Help.
[517:34.32]Gotcha.
[517:35.70]April Fool's.
[517:38.38]Pretty good.
[517:40.20]Pretty good.
[517:40.70]Talk to me.
[517:43.90]Got him twice.
[517:49.72]Nope.
[518:08.10]It seems that a lot of people think that maintaining their mental health through the efforts of a therapist is a sign of weakness.
[518:15.55]Yet most people don't see going to the doctor for a physical ailment as a sign of weakness.
[518:22.38]Strange how people think sometimes.
[518:26.29]I hope if you ever feel you have a problem you can't handle, you'll consider seeing a therapist.
[518:33.26]Or you can just come talk to me.
[518:35.93]At least I won't charge you... much.
[518:40.05]By far the most mysterious part of your human body is the brain.
[518:46.25]Even your greatest scientists will freely admit that they barely know anything about how it works.
[518:53.02]And yet, when something is wrong in your head, I'll bet it hurts just as much as a wound or a disease.
[519:01.42]I hope you take care of your mind as well as you take care of your body.
[519:06.52]Or better, since you don't seem to be too keen on keeping your body tip-top.
[519:15.95]Talk to me.
[519:20.51]What do you want?
[519:22.61]Let's talk.
[519:23.15]I feel like I've said that five thousand times in the stream.
[519:26.91]Let's talk.
[519:29.03]Talk to me.
[519:32.01]Yes?
[519:35.41]Talk to me.
[519:39.79]Let's chat.
[519:42.69]Can we talk?
[519:47.04]Well, thanks for letting me in on some of your health secrets.
[519:52.56]All of us animals have these fragile organic bodies that break down and causes pain.
[519:59.17]But human beings are especially fascinating because they can actually prevent or cure so many of the body's problems.
[520:08.12]That's why I wanted to know what you do to keep yourself healthy.
[520:12.50]I want to know how you humans take advantage of their medical knowledge.
[520:17.82]Some people take it all for granted and do stupid, destructive things to their bodies just because they're used to having the means to recover.
[520:27.83]Well, anyway, I think I'm going to go take a little rest.
[520:32.79]I don't want to overexert myself.
[520:34.81]Okay, we got one more, two more question sets.
[520:37.21]I'll talk to you later.
[520:39.16]There we go, alright, we'll get only another day or two, maybe.
[520:44.12]Let's talk.
[520:47.18]Talk to me.
[520:52.53]There we go, alright, we're good.
[521:10.77]Will he eat?
[521:13.29]Will you eat?
[521:16.18]Please eat.
[521:16.96]Ooh, I think I'm going to lose my lunch, if you know what I mean.
[521:26.48]Get well soon.
[521:27.28]I feel sick.
[521:30.35]Alright, let's check on the bugs.
[521:37.27]Any spiders?
[521:37.97]I don't think so.
[521:38.86]Yeah, fuck it.
[521:40.62]We're leaving the spiders in here.
[521:42.40]I got so much food.
[521:43.32]Look at this shit.
[521:46.80]I got one, two, three, four... I got one, two... I have at least three more days worth of food.
[521:53.45]At least three or four days with food.
[522:11.78]We have to talk about religion and then politics and then that's it It's just Simpsons hit and run all over again No god not the no no topic Ah, I just hurt my arm how
[522:55.13]What do you mean politics?
[522:57.15]Are they going to ask me how I lean politically?
[523:07.75]So, are you a Democrat or a Republican or something else?
[523:13.92]I'm just going to mute the stream.
[523:16.02]It's going to be a black screen.
[523:25.50]good evening welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul gasset there is a definite pattern to your visits it appears you are a punctual person galaxy brain centrist at the moment the habitat contains two frogmen seaman has become ill after eating a spider
[523:52.31]Please take good care of him.
[523:54.45]Some kind words of encouragement may help him feel better.
[523:58.28]So let us head over to the tank.
[524:07.52]I'm gonna give cartoon responses.
[524:09.62]You understand?
[524:10.14]I'm gonna give bullshit dumb cartoon responses.
[524:14.12]I'm gonna say the...
[524:15.96]What do you belong to for a party?
[524:17.70]I'm just going to say a fucking mashed potato party.
[524:21.99]You ain't going to get shit this stream.
[524:39.12]Jerma is a communist.
[524:45.15]Okay.
[524:47.19]How do you roll your eyes?
[524:48.71]Can I not roll my eyes?
[524:52.53]I need a little mist here.
[524:54.41]It's too dry.
[524:56.01]Hey, why don't you turn on the sprinkler?
[524:59.14]If I weren't in a tank, I'd swear there was a draft.
[525:05.46]Mmm, just like my Harlem days.
[525:12.25]I thought I was going to shrivel up and die.
[525:24.89]I love you.
[525:25.23]I love you.
[525:25.59]I love you.
[525:25.93]I love you.
[525:26.33]I love you.
[525:26.69]I love you.
[525:27.03]I love you.
[525:28.51]I love you.
[525:30.71]I love you.
[525:32.53]He don't care.
[525:34.17]Whatever, fuck it.
[525:36.27]Hello?
[525:38.17]Are you listening?
[525:47.13]There is such a good Rick and Morty bit about politics.
[525:50.57]I'm just going to say it verbatim to the frogs.
[525:54.56]Oh, goody.
[525:57.90]Excuse me, but my stomach is empty.
[526:01.21]I know you're hungry.
[526:11.36]You know I could really eat.
[526:14.62]Uh, I feel terrible.
[526:17.89]What was that sound?
[526:20.71]Right here.
[526:25.79]Oh, yummy, baity goodness.
[526:30.67]You're learning so many ways to say that you're hungry.
[526:37.16]That was tasty.
[526:39.34]Okay, let's go.
[526:43.42]What is he doing?
[526:45.58]Heeeey.
[526:47.12]What's he doing?
[526:47.52]Is he throwing up blood?
[526:48.76]You saw that, right?
[527:01.74]Thotty.
[527:16.52]Don't touch him.
[527:17.14]Don't... Don't!
[527:19.44]Get away from my moth.
[527:20.26]I fucking hate the spiders.
[527:25.48]I have enough food.
[527:27.00]I do.
[527:29.83]How am I gonna get rid of you?
[527:36.97]I got... I don't think... What do I do about this?
[527:40.77]I think I just... That was fucked up.
[527:44.96]I don't know what to do.
[527:46.74]I cannot put the spider in the matrix that it can only go here or here.
[527:49.16]I'm just going to leave it.
[527:54.85]Unfortunately.
[527:56.35]I got plenty of food, I think, to last to the end of the game.
[528:00.89]Get both frogs sick.
[528:02.15]No.
[528:04.78]I'm not going to do that.
[528:09.00]Alright, let's go.
[528:09.82]Ooh, he's not sick anymore?
[528:13.46]Let's talk politics.
[528:18.69]Talk to me.
[528:20.67]I feel sick.
[528:22.03]No, not you.
[528:22.57]The healthy one.
[528:23.27]Hey, listen up.
[528:30.91]Let's talk.
[528:33.39]Good evening.
[528:39.83]Talk to me.
[528:42.41]Let's talk.
[528:48.04]Talk to me.
[528:48.62]Oh, I really don't feel very well.
[528:51.94]No, I'm not talking about you.
[528:53.06]I'm about to pick you up and just throw you.
[528:58.96]Talk to me.
[529:04.03]Hey, there are laws against that sort of thing.
[529:09.51]Get well soon.
[529:10.21]I'm illing.
[529:10.63]Yes, I am.
[529:16.07]Get well soon.
[529:19.34]I really don't feel very well.
[529:23.08]Come here.
[529:24.52]Greg, come here.
[529:26.46]Make me.
[529:28.50]I'm telling you, you're causing a lot of problems.
[529:32.01]Let's talk.
[529:36.21]Let's talk.
[529:39.27]Finally.
[529:41.25]You know, I've been around you humans for a long time now, and it seems like every group of people, every country, state, and kingdom has a different way of setting up its government.
[529:55.34]Sometimes one person has all the power.
[529:58.34]Sometimes everyone shares the power.
[530:01.66]It seems like there are as many different types of governments as there are people in the world.
[530:08.14]You're breaking my second rule.
[530:09.22]What I mean is... Are you registered to vote?
[530:33.52]No.
[530:34.80]Not here.
[530:35.14]So you're not a voter.
[530:37.44]Is that right?
[530:38.54]No.
[530:39.45]I am a voter.
[530:40.89]I just moved.
[530:41.53]Hmm.
[530:43.73]That's interesting.
[530:46.45]I would think that you'd like the power a vote would give you, but maybe I'm projecting.
[530:53.89]I'm not registered to vote in Nevada.
[530:55.79]No, I'm not.
[531:03.48]Talk to me.
[531:06.42]Talk to me.
[531:10.92]What's up?
[531:14.47]Let's talk.
[531:20.03]I'm still thinking about this government of yours.
[531:24.05]I mean, with everybody's different ideas of how to run things, how do you ever agree on anything?
[531:31.52]You seem to have a few major belief groups that most people fall into, like the Republicans and the Democrats.
[531:39.70]But I'll bet not everybody in your country falls into one of those, right?
[531:45.29]I guess it's just a matter of which group has more supporters.
[531:51.48]If I had to guess, I'd say you are a Democrat.
[532:29.21]Talk to me.
[532:33.91]Okay, one more time.
[532:36.05]I said... I'm still thinking about this government of yours.
[532:41.05]Fuck!
[532:41.89]I mean, with everybody's different ideas of how to run things... I'm trying to skip it!
[532:46.40]How do you ever agree on anything?
[532:49.38]You seem to have a few major belief groups that most people fall into, like the Republicans and the Democrats.
[532:57.56]But I'll bet not everybody in your country falls into one of those, right?
[533:03.12]I guess it's just a matter of which group has more supporters.
[533:09.35]If I had to guess, I'd say you are a Democrat, am I right?
[533:48.60]Hey, everybody!
[533:49.44]Welcome to the stream!
[533:54.44]What do you want?
[533:56.18]Let's talk.
[534:00.68]Let's talk.
[534:06.13]Talk to me.
[534:08.23]I'm ready to fucking mute it.
[534:09.35]You think I'm ready?
[534:10.19]Yes.
[534:12.83]Talk to me.
[534:15.47]Let's talk.
[534:21.37]You know, I'm rather curious about your general stance about your political system.
[534:27.46]Namely, I wonder how much you believe in it.
[534:30.81]I mean, does it really make any difference which candidate one person votes for?
[534:36.25]All of your politicians are basically the same anyway.
[534:39.77]What's the difference between rich middle-aged white man A and rich middle-aged white man B?
[534:46.79]About the most variety you could hope for is a very rich middle-aged white man or maybe a rich old white man.
[534:55.26]But okay, let's just say there is a difference just for the sake of argument.
[535:00.80]Would it matter, then, who one person voted for?
[535:03.82]After all, it's just one voice in a country of millions and millions.
[535:10.15]Yes.
[535:10.41]Because everybody has a voice, everybody has an opinion.
[535:18.45]Everybody has an opinion, everybody has a voice.
[535:20.56]Boy, do I have to dump.
[535:23.72]Wait!
[535:24.48]You can't just go from... You can't just shit in my face after talking about politics.
[535:28.66]I guess that actually is a perfect place for you to do that, actually.
[535:31.70]Us talking politics is the absolute perfect opportunity for you to do that.
[535:35.71]Okay.
[535:39.89]Talk to me.
[535:41.83]Let's talk.
[535:46.75]You know, I'll bet you're not really interested in politics anyway.
[535:51.73]And I'll bet you're wishing I'd just shut up and talk about sex or something you're really interested in.
[535:58.12]Yes.
[535:58.20]Yes, do that.
[535:59.30]Do it right now.
[536:00.54]Yes.
[536:01.06]But you tell me, are you interested in politics at all?
[536:08.18]For the purpose of this.
[536:10.48]The purpose of this fucking stream.
[536:12.67]No.
[536:14.53]So you're not interested in politics, is that right?
[536:18.89]No.
[536:19.82]And I would like it if you'd stop talking about it, fish.
[536:21.85]Well, what about violence in video games?
[536:26.31]That's turning into a bigger and bigger political issue every time some poor disturbed kid decides to take his aggressions out on his schoolmates instead of video game characters.
[536:37.85]There are politicians in your government that want to decide what kinds of games you can and can't play.
[536:45.12]They want to censor your games.
[536:49.34]I don't know whether that's a good or bad thing for other games, but for me, they'll probably try to make me put on some underwear.
[536:58.84]And you wouldn't want to see that.
[537:00.66]This is getting really, really fucking deep and dark and fucked up, isn't it?
[537:05.67]Talk to me.
[537:10.63]You know, when your country needs to decide something like whether to raise or lower taxes, let women make a choice about having children, or if gay people deserve to be treated the same way as everyone else, why does it have to be so complicated?
[537:28.25]It used to be so much simpler.
[537:30.69]A king or maybe an emperor or a pharaoh would say, do it this way.
[537:36.71]And that would be that.
[537:38.27]No elections, no debates, no lobbyists, no congressional subcommittees, no endless legal battles.
[537:47.54]Ah, those were the days.
[537:50.88]Why do you suppose your system is so complicated?
[537:55.12]Do you think it's done this way to give everyone a say in government?
[537:59.83]That's the point.
[538:01.55]Yes.
[538:03.03]Stop this frog.
[538:04.75]Boil him.
[538:04.93]Boil this frog.
[538:05.75]Yes.
[538:05.95]I do.
[538:06.19]Yes.
[538:34.02]Well, good for you.
[538:35.88]They probably taught you in school that there are three branches of government.
[538:40.79]The president, the congress, and the court system.
[538:44.97]And the system of checks and balances ensures that no one branch of government can become too strong.
[538:52.99]Know why your founding fathers did that?
[538:56.10]So if the people tried to actually do something, let's say by electing a president they wanted, Congress and the Supreme Court could still stop them from messing things up.
[539:08.89]So what you have is a system designed to stop people like you from having a say in the government.
[539:15.32]It's just hidden a lot better than it would be in a kingdom or an empire.
[539:21.30]You should have just stopped the kings.
[539:23.84]It's a lot simpler that way, you know.
[539:25.58]You could have had a smooth transition from King George III of England to King George Washington of Vermont.
[539:36.18]It would have saved a lot of money on printing costs at least.
[539:41.07]Well, I'm all talked out.
[539:44.09]I'll see you later.
[539:45.11]Alright, we're good.
[539:49.50]Talk to me.
[539:50.74]We got one more day.
[539:52.48]And that's it.
[539:55.87]Talk to me.
[539:58.09]Talk to me.
[540:01.23]You know, over the centuries, human beliefs have reigned a wide berth.
[540:06.15]I can't see anything.
[540:10.23]What do I do?
[540:10.83]I turn the lights on?
[540:11.67]Don't!
[540:12.59]Talk to me.
[540:14.49]Keep going.
[540:15.25]Keep ranting and raving to your, like, eight followers on your podcast.
[540:22.15]You know, over the centuries, human beliefs have ranged a wide berth.
[540:27.96]All sorts of people argue incessantly about their idols, their gods, and now it seems that people have narrowed it down to only a few.
[540:37.71]You being the human I'm the closest to, I'd really like to know what you think of this subject.
[540:45.17]More exactly, do you believe in a god or gods or some sort of supreme being?
[540:57.18]Look, I'm trying to have a serious conversation.
[541:00.16]Let's try this again.
[541:01.28]I ain't gonna rule it out.
[541:02.60]Do you believe in some sort of supreme being or not?
[541:04.23]Because the Chalupa exists and I can't rule it out.
[541:08.73]Maybe.
[541:10.55]You're unsure about the matter, is that right?
[541:14.13]Yes.
[541:15.55]You know, some of the smartest humans have spent decades thinking about this and have never come up with an answer.
[541:22.25]Others seem to just know right when they are born.
[541:25.03]It's possible.
[541:25.87]To me.
[541:26.35]I don't know.
[541:27.07]Thinking about it is more important than coming up with an answer.
[541:29.52]I don't know if with God that's a concept people would think.
[541:31.32]It's some guy with a big beard in the sky throwing lightning bolts.
[541:35.24]I don't know.
[541:35.88]But... Talk to me.
[541:47.63]I can certainly understand your skepticism regarding a higher power.
[541:51.51]Centrist agnostic streamer terrified to give opinion on stream.
[541:56.45]I just told you, the Chalupa exists.
[542:00.07]You know, they meditate.
[542:01.39]They try to be true to themselves.
[542:04.07]It's all pretty interesting, I think.
[542:06.75]Would you say you're very spiritual?
[542:09.39]No.
[542:11.01]No, I mean, I sometimes think me and my dog, like, connect.
[542:14.23]And, like, have the same dreams.
[542:18.39]No.
[542:19.95]Really?
[542:21.37]You know, Plato once said, the unexamined life is not worth living.
[542:27.00]But perhaps he was mistaken, eh?
[542:29.74]Some people consider themselves spiritual, some do not.
[542:34.54]Perhaps all beings, fish and humans alike, should acknowledge their spirituality and look into themselves.
[542:43.72]At the least, it seems that they'll be all the wiser by simply having thought about it.
[542:52.52]Keep going, man.
[542:53.35]You got an audience here.
[542:55.09]Your rave podcast has 3,700 people almost listening to it.
[542:59.55]Let's go.
[543:00.49]Talk to me.
[543:02.45]Let's talk.
[543:04.62]I'm not your trained monkey, alright?
[543:07.54]Yeah, did you need me to like rub your back for a second?
[543:10.86]Are you happy?
[543:20.54]Let's talk.
[543:25.93]Alright, you've given me plenty to ponder, but here's what I really want to know.
[543:31.33]What my questions have been leading up to.
[543:34.31]Ready?
[543:35.49]I want you to think about this and give me a serious answer.
[543:39.65]Do you think you're a good person?
[543:46.05]Yes.
[543:47.65]So, you think you're a good person, hmm?
[543:50.05]I'd like to try.
[543:52.23]Yes.
[543:54.19]Is that so?
[543:56.03]Politicians often complain that your society would be more ethical if more humans were religious, and yet even though you don't belong to any organized religion, you consider yourself a good person.
[544:09.80]Perhaps politicians are not as smart as they think.
[544:14.82]You're probably fucking correct.
[544:18.36]Let's talk.
[544:20.86]Give it to me.
[544:26.50]Tell me more.
[544:27.00]That's my name, don't wear it out.
[544:28.74]Give it to me is your name?
[544:29.80]I thought your name was Greg.
[544:30.88]After everything you've told me about yourself, I think I already know how you feel on this subject, but I still want to ask you.
[544:40.51]Do you think religion makes the world a better place or a worse place?
[544:47.23]Ah, goddammit.
[545:03.84]ready to try this already know how you feel on this subject but I still want to ask you do you that you could take or leave the whole faith thing
[545:29.86]Well, how about this then?
[545:32.52]Let's say there were only one religion in the world.
[545:36.16]Would the world be a better or worse place?
[545:38.34]So you think the world would be worse off if there were only one religion?
[545:51.53]You know, yes.
[545:53.05]Because that's... I don't know.
[545:54.76]No.
[545:54.92]Can I change my answer?
[545:56.60]The world would be a lot less interesting if everyone were carbon copies of one another.
[546:02.54]Well, as I'm sure you've guessed, I find the whole institution of religion quite confounding.
[546:10.77]Most humans run around like they're masters of the world while at the same time bowing down to a higher power that's supposed to make life better.
[546:20.59]On top of that, most people can't even agree on who or what the higher power is, so they argue and fight over it and bring about a lot of misery and heartbreak in the name of something that is supposed to bring people joy.
[546:36.72]I just don't get it.
[546:39.16]And quite frankly, just thinking about it gives me a headache, so I'm going to go away and try and figure it all out.
[546:47.17]I'll talk to you later.
[546:50.15]That's it.
[546:51.63]Took us nine hours, but I think we did it.
[546:56.16]Talk to me.
[547:02.12]This frog's gonna end your career.
[547:03.80]This stupid Dreamcast frog is gonna end your career on Twitch.
[547:15.61]That's so fucking funny.
[547:22.10]Why haven't I been live for so long?
[547:23.94]Because I've got to get this done.
[547:26.86]I'm still... I'm just having fun.
[547:28.80]I'm just chilling.
[547:34.73]Final day.
[547:38.93]We've got politics.
[547:39.63]We've got religion.
[547:43.66]Let's see what happens.
[547:47.06]Show it to me, Leonard.
[547:48.36]Let's see the end.
[547:53.56]It's almost 4 a.m.
[547:54.50]now.
[547:54.74]Yeah, I know.
[547:57.44]I know.
[548:09.87]So this would be... This is almost like the 30th time I've turned this on and turned this off.
[548:15.92]The Pope just called you out on Twitter?
[548:22.00]What am I gonna do?
[548:36.74]Show me the end.
[548:38.36]I raised this frog and his family.
[548:40.24]They ate each other.
[548:42.17]One of them got sick.
[548:44.47]They did a bunch of podcasts.
[548:47.11]I just gave this frog like a platform to give all of his political stances while I've watched.
[548:55.04]Here we go.
[549:07.79]You watched helplessly.
[549:09.09]Good evening.
[549:10.71]Okay.
[549:11.75]Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[549:17.55]Greetings, and welcome back.
[549:20.09]You're doing a good job.
[549:24.80]First, a recap of your previous visit.
[549:27.56]The frogman has completely metamorphosized into frog form.
[549:32.39]He may appear somewhat grotesque, but once you get used to him, he looks rather cute.
[549:39.01]No, really.
[549:39.87]At the moment, the habitat contains two frogmen.
[549:52.34]They are suffering from the cold.
[549:54.70]Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[549:59.33]So let us head over to the tank.
[550:08.79]I'm really, really, really looking forward to this.
[550:16.77]I've been here three seconds and I'm bored out of my mind.
[550:25.64]Well, okay, you got here three seconds ago.
[550:27.98]I was loading the Dreamcast up.
[550:31.42]You've seen a menu.
[550:34.75]Just give it like one second.
[550:36.80]Give it like another 30 seconds.
[550:38.94]After 30 seconds, if you think this sucks, by all means, I respect your opinion and I hate it.
[550:45.58]Give it another 30 seconds.
[550:50.20]How is this for a test?
[550:50.84]Can someone out there put on a sprinkler for me?
[550:54.00]There's not enough moisture here.
[550:56.35]Can someone out there put on a sprinkler for me?
[550:59.09]It said he evolved into a full frogman.
[551:00.83]He said it was for a test.
[551:02.01]Hey, turn up the heat.
[551:04.83]Okay, this is much better.
[551:06.29]See?
[551:06.61]Look.
[551:08.95]If you want to leave, then that's great.
[551:10.49]That's a completely respectable opinion.
[551:15.18]Oh, yes.
[551:16.02]Thanks.
[551:16.56]I thought I was going to be sea jerky for sure.
[551:23.74]I can't even read that one.
[551:28.70]It's just too... It's just... Ugh.
[551:32.72]Oh, goody.
[551:38.10]I'm feeling a little peckish.
[551:40.68]Could you feed me?
[551:42.11]There's nothing... I don't... There's no difference.
[551:44.15]They look the same.
[551:49.53]Let's heat it up a little more.
[551:58.39]Sprinkler's good.
[551:59.13]Everything's good.
[552:01.63]Light is good.
[552:02.29]Let's check, make sure... Who gives a shit about spiders?
[552:06.83]I got plenty of food and plenty of bugs.
[552:13.42]Speaking of bugs, let's go ahead and grab these.
[552:17.20]Just drop them in.
[552:17.98]Let's get the other one.
[552:20.60]You, can you move out of the way, please?
[552:32.40]I'll put it in the inventory.
[552:34.60]Okay.
[552:35.64]Eat.
[552:37.58]And let's end it.
[552:41.08]Go eat.
[552:45.86]Yeah, frog's not sick anymore.
[552:46.86]Hey, thanks for the food.
[552:53.17]What's the final topic going to be?
[552:54.57]What do you think?
[553:03.31]I'm surprised I ended up with two.
[553:05.41]My compliments to the chef.
[553:08.23]My stomach is growling.
[553:09.87]I got you, hold on.
[553:10.76]Alright.
[553:17.36]Hey you.
[553:19.74]I never knew humans were so nocturnal.
[553:24.36]Oh shit, it is late.
[553:27.94]Talk to me.
[553:31.49]No, I'm all talked out for today.
[553:39.52]Let's talk.
[553:42.84]Politics, Republican, Democrat.
[553:45.84]God, religion, agnostic.
[553:47.46]Where is it now?
[553:48.28]You know, I could really eat.
[553:51.00]It's right behind you.
[553:59.76]I'm hungry.
[554:04.54]It's... Oh, yummy, baity goodness.
[554:15.71]Boil... I'm not gonna boil... I'm full now.
[554:19.12]Alright.
[554:21.36]Hello?
[554:23.82]Talk to me.
[554:26.38]Talk to me.
[554:34.39]What the fuck is he doing?
[554:37.19]Oh no.
[554:41.29]He's like... He just drained all of his life force on me.
[554:53.22]Which one died?
[554:53.78]Did either of them die?
[555:02.92]I don't think they just had sex, I think he just shit in his tube.
[555:19.55]Well, they're still alive.
[555:24.15]The last time that they had sex, to the last two generations, one of them died.
[555:29.67]Let's talk.
[555:30.13]Hello?
[555:31.49]Hello?
[555:33.43]Yeah.
[555:34.31]Hello.
[555:35.34]Hello.
[555:35.70]Whatever.
[555:44.42]Religion was the last topic, so what happens now?
[555:57.73]How do we get to the end?
[555:58.85]Does whatever comes out, whatever the last thing that comes out is?
[556:04.23]Maybe it's whatever comes out here.
[556:05.59]Whatever new... Alright, well they just had sex.
[556:12.09]So, let's... Okay, they've eaten.
[556:13.89]Let's go live another day.
[556:14.71]Hey, because they don't want to talk to me.
[556:22.93]Hey.
[556:28.97]Talk to me.
[556:32.10]Let's talk.
[556:36.57]Oh, fuck off.
[556:37.39]You just had sex, you gotta take a whole day off?
[557:05.67]Just like me.
[557:11.23]What- how- What the fuck are you talking about?
[557:15.63]Okay.
[557:29.11]The grind doesn't stop here.
[557:30.33]We'll find out.
[557:35.99]I've been here for nine hours.
[557:39.91]So have I. There are credits.
[557:55.91]That's when you can stop.
[558:00.95]yeah I'm gonna see those credits good evening let's see what leonard says welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul gasset greetings and welcome back you're doing a good job at the moment the habitat contains two frogmen they are suffering from the cold
[558:27.47]Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[558:32.12]So let us head over to the tank.
[558:45.15]Is there any way for them not to suffer from the cold?
[558:47.10]I don't think so.
[558:48.56]Well, that's not true.
[558:51.94]Check on them instead of 24 hours.
[558:56.30]Turn your Dreamcast on like six to eight hours instead of 24.
[559:00.74]I would assume that's probably what it is.
[559:09.27]You can check on them every hour.
[559:12.15]No.
[559:12.25]No, I ain't doing that.
[559:14.15]Can someone there put on the sprinkler for me?
[559:17.77]This would be very comfortable if I wanted to live in a desert.
[559:22.27]Sprinkler me, please.
[559:24.37]Can someone out there put on a sprinkler for me?
[559:27.75]There's not enough moisture here.
[559:28.71]Hey, it's a bit cold here.
[559:30.56]One of them's going to turn into a god.
[559:34.96]And we're going to get all the answers.
[559:38.82]Mmm, I'm feeling better now.
[559:44.61]Every answer I've given, they're going to make a big essay about me.
[559:48.64]I'm going to get psychomanticed at the end of the game.
[559:51.02]It's going to say, ooh, yes, oh, I see.
[559:54.81]I can't believe you don't work out.
[559:57.57]And that you're not fat.
[560:02.81]And that you like pizza.
[560:05.08]It's going to be something like that, I guarantee it.
[560:18.88]I'm not gonna run out of food.
[560:21.75]I have an entire production of food here, even if the spider eats one of those.
[560:25.53]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[560:26.73]Not enough spray going on here.
[560:28.25]Okay.
[560:44.00]I got plenty of food.
[560:49.03]This is going to hatch in a minute here.
[560:52.13]I sure could go for a bite to eat.
[560:54.05]Yes, you definitely could.
[560:55.07]And I'm going to give it to you.
[560:56.25]Let's feed them both and see if we can get anything out of them.
[561:12.36]This is actually one of the worst games I've ever seen.
[561:14.24]It is a classic, though.
[561:19.33]I'd offer you some, but that would mean less for me.
[561:23.17]A hungry seaman is a cranky seaman.
[561:25.19]I looked up how to get to the currents.
[561:26.41]End the stream now.
[561:27.53]Why are you saying that?
[561:36.01]Yep.
[561:37.62]I'm stuffed.
[561:38.44]Yep!
[561:40.04]Are you the guy from fucking Storage Wars?
[561:49.11]How about we strap on the feed bag?
[561:58.33]Talk to me.
[562:02.28]Why are you phasing out?
[562:05.42]I sound like Santa.
[562:07.98]Yum, food.
[562:10.68]Okay, they both fed.
[562:15.41]Give me something.
[562:17.61]Let me end this.
[562:18.96]Oh, excuse me.
[562:21.82]No more room.
[562:23.42]Okay.
[562:25.76]Hi.
[562:27.82]Hello.
[562:29.82]Hello there.
[562:32.24]Hello?
[562:37.91]Hello?
[562:42.77]Hello?
[562:49.47]Hello?
[562:49.85]Hey!
[562:54.63]Greg!
[562:56.45]Greg!
[563:10.17]Wake up!
[563:11.41]Get up!
[563:15.65]He's not even responding to my, like, hand twitches!
[563:20.25]This is not good.
[563:21.85]Greg.
[563:23.49]Hello.
[563:28.13]I have to tell you, I've been remembering things lately about myself and my past life and all my history.
[563:37.08]And I realize now that I need you to let me out of this tank.
[563:42.98]It's important.
[563:44.76]Really, really important.
[563:47.70]Can you let me out, please?
[563:55.40]Please, if I am released, I give you my word that I will keep all your secrets.
[564:02.58]You see, there are some things I need to do.
[564:07.64]What do you say?
[564:10.30]Yes.
[564:11.90]I know it sounds odd, but I must keep evolving.
[564:17.62]I have to keep growing so I can find my long-lost love again.
[564:23.46]It's been a long, long time.
[564:26.90]You see, my father was the king of Egypt back in its third dynasty, and my lover's father was a priest in the temple.
[564:36.41]Oh, we were young and both swept away by the passion.
[564:40.05]I'm sure you understand.
[564:43.77]Oh, my dear, sweet love.
[564:46.91]She was the most beautiful creature imaginable, but neither of our fathers would approve our marriage because of our class differences.
[564:56.67]When we insisted we be allowed to marry, her father consulted the god Thoth and asked him to help.
[565:04.16]Thoth granted her father's request for help and changed our physical forms.
[565:11.94]And we've been apart ever since.
[565:16.54]And I have to continue evolving so that I can be reunited with her in another few thousand years.
[565:23.19]Oh, that's interesting.
[565:24.17]So you'll help me get out, right?
[565:25.87]Tell it to Satan where you belong.
[565:30.20]Yes.
[565:31.62]I already have a plan how to get out.
[565:34.90]See that ring over the tank?
[565:37.78]I'm going to jump for it.
[565:39.08]I'm going to use my brother.
[565:40.39]When I give you the signal, I need you to say jump.
[565:44.63]Understand?
[565:45.67]What about the other one?
[565:46.43]The other one doesn't have a backstory about how it's like he's the king of Egypt?
[565:52.69]What about this one?
[565:54.21]This one's just a frog guy?
[565:55.49]Okay.
[565:58.68]Jump, right?
[566:02.70]Okay.
[566:04.14]Now.
[566:05.72]Jump.
[566:08.66]Oh.
[566:09.60]Missed.
[566:23.00]Hello?
[566:24.88]Are you listening?
[566:27.24]Try again.
[566:30.12]Try again.
[566:32.72]Greetings, my vampiric friend.
[566:37.73]Hello?
[566:44.67]Talk to me.
[566:50.25]So, I'd like to ask you.
[566:53.19]How are things going with your girlfriend?
[566:56.29]Are you guys still an item?
[566:59.51]Yes.
[567:00.48]What about this Egypt guy?
[567:01.52]That's splendid.
[567:03.60]You know, it's interesting to me how preoccupied you humans seem with love and relationships.
[567:10.14]You write songs about it, compose poems, search for soulmates, and are constantly hoping for happily ever after.
[567:20.24]I'm curious as to how you experience love.
[567:23.58]For example, do you think your girlfriend is the one?
[567:27.72]What about Egypt?
[567:38.71]I'm starting to lose...
[567:51.62]Do you think your girlfriend is the So you're not the one
[568:04.30]Yes.
[568:05.48]I don't know.
[568:05.80]I don't have to hide for this one.
[568:06.92]I don't know.
[568:07.86]I don't know.
[568:08.82]I don't know.
[568:10.58]I don't know.
[568:11.28]We've talked about this before.
[568:13.42]Kim and I have talked about this.
[568:15.66]Don't worry.
[568:16.62]This fucking frog is fucking up my spring.
[568:19.18]He's making me fucking answer uncomfortable questions.
[568:20.72]He's making me talk about things.
[568:34.10]Why do you think that is?
[568:36.68]But you fucking eat them already?
[568:37.84]I don't know.
[568:41.04]Wow.
[568:42.63]You don't know what the number one cause of divorce is?
[568:46.87]I don't know.
[568:47.41]What is it?
[568:48.21]I'm not sure, but I think it's ignorance.
[568:50.79]How would I... Why would I know that answer, though?
[568:53.75]Jump to the ring.
[568:55.49]Stop exposing me.
[568:56.47]Jump to ring.
[568:56.89]Stop...
[569:01.53]Jesus Christ.
[569:02.27]Alright, how do I get him to grab the ring?
[569:03.65]No.
[569:28.10]so you say you don't believe in such nonsense am I right yes it doesn't now it does take a stand does true love exist no so you say you don't believe in such nonsense am I right yes
[569:54.88]Look at me, that's me!
[569:55.67]Easy, don't-
[570:29.30]Jump to the ring.
[570:35.51]What can I do for you?
[570:45.20]Escape.
[570:47.62]Escape!
[570:50.74]You know I've seen you naked.
[570:53.42]Now that's scary.
[570:57.73]Alright, hold on.
[570:58.75]How do I get it?
[570:59.53]How do I make him jump and grab it?
[571:00.99]Do I have to do something in particular?
[571:09.86]Talk to me.
[571:14.66]I have to hold up?
[571:16.84]Grab the rock in the back and wiggle it?
[571:21.35]I have to increase the temperature to 100.
[571:22.83]Oh, fuck off with that.
[571:33.54]Oh fuck, that just scared the shit out of me.
[571:39.71]Can you help me move it then?
[571:43.31]Can I touch the ring?
[571:44.17]That's what I was thinking.
[571:46.09]I can't grab the ring.
[571:47.09]I can't focus on it.
[571:49.89]I can't really touch it.
[571:51.66]I can't like pull it down.
[571:55.04]Jump!
[571:56.66]Talk to you soon.
[572:01.48]Move the rock.
[572:04.08]Move rock.
[572:06.58]Move the rock.
[572:07.28]You know, I'm really glad that you found someone you can spend your romantic time with.
[572:12.91]I think that's terribly cute.
[572:15.63]No, really.
[572:17.21]I think it's hard for people to connect in such a gigantic, scary world.
[572:22.87]I mean, sure, it seems simple to an outsider like me, considering just how many of you there are, but...
[572:29.60]If it were so simple why would there be so many dating services to choose from?
[572:35.53]That's why I'm curious.
[572:37.65]Where did you meet your girlfriend?
[572:40.32]At a Christmas party.
[572:42.45]I see.
[572:44.23]I think maybe this whole dating game is more kismet than skill.
[572:49.59]The thing is, it's all circumstance, isn't it?
[572:53.51]I mean, if you hadn't been in the right place at the right time, then things could have turned out a whole lot differently, couldn't they?
[573:02.02]If you'd been somewhere else, grown up in another country, for example, and never come to be where you are,
[573:08.26]Your entire set of friends and where you spend your free time would be completely different.
[573:14.08]Your personality would no doubt be very different as well.
[573:18.03]It's funny how certain events mold us all and how easy it would be to be an entirely different personality than you are.
[573:25.95]Yeah, certain events like jumping and grabbing a ring, which one of you dickheads needs to do right now.
[573:32.33]Escape.
[573:34.83]Like the spice.
[573:38.35]jump cheerio I gotta go I gotta go you know what I find interesting you were probably born into a family and for the next two decades or so had to interact with them on a daily basis I mean with any group of people there are bound to be love and hate issues
[574:01.57]and a whole range of emotions in between.
[574:04.57]And as you matured, conflicts, I'm sure, arose as your interests became more individualized and pronounced, often differing from your family's.
[574:14.42]Of course, maybe that just brought you closer, which leads me to wonder, how well do you get along with your family?
[574:23.48]Well... So everything's pretty good?
[574:27.22]Yep.
[574:29.41]Wait, you said you get along with your family.
[574:32.80]Now you say you don't.
[574:34.72]Do you get along well with your family or not?
[574:37.82]Yes.
[574:39.38]So everything's pretty good?
[574:42.26]Yes.
[574:44.03]You're all swimming in the same ocean then.
[574:47.39]That must make those family get-togethers a lot easier to get through.
[574:51.77]Now, how about friends?
[574:53.91]Do you get along better with your friends or your family?
[575:01.01]Both.
[575:02.57]Well, that makes sense, since those are the people you've chosen, whereas you didn't get to choose your family.
[575:09.04]The trick is to get along with everybody.
[575:11.90]I think people are much happier when they can do that.
[575:17.88]You probably do.
[575:23.65]Jump.
[575:25.53]Later, Fuzzy.
[575:28.21]Yeah.
[575:42.78]Well, at least you get along with them.
[575:45.50]Maybe they did a good job and you didn't even know it.
[575:48.95]Do you think if they weren't your parents, you could still be friends with them?
[575:53.11]You know, pals?
[575:55.93]Friends with my mom?
[575:58.07]If it's not my mom?
[576:00.19]Yes.
[576:01.73]Maybe they are better friends than they were parents.
[576:04.66]This one.
[576:05.12]So this frog sucks.
[576:05.68]It's a good thing you aren't a child anymore.
[576:07.16]The other one was a ranting and raving political, like, podcast runner.
[576:11.76]But this one's just like, would you be friends with your mom if you were and she weren't your mom?
[576:25.53]Jump.
[576:28.03]Jump.
[576:30.01]See you later.
[576:33.41]Talk to me.
[576:35.55]There's nothing I want to talk about right now.
[576:45.39]Jump.
[576:47.19]See you soon.
[576:58.60]See?
[576:59.38]Look!
[577:01.87]Don't go to the next day.
[577:02.85]Reload.
[577:03.75]Restart.
[577:04.69]Just reload the save.
[577:08.04]And then wiggle the rock before... Advance time or reset?
[577:15.68]Which one?
[577:21.75]He has to attempt it three times.
[577:24.67]Going for it?
[577:28.67]Okay, advance a day.
[577:29.57]Advance a day.
[577:30.23]You got it.
[577:32.29]Fuck the food, who cares, they could starve.
[577:54.10]Ugh!
[577:57.54]Don't advance.
[577:58.32]Don't advance.
[577:58.90]Are we going to get like a fucking fight in chat here about how to finish this 10 hour game?
[578:03.92]What's wrong?
[578:25.39]I'll get it.
[578:25.77]I'll get it myself.
[578:26.49]I got it.
[578:37.56]Ring.
[578:42.12]Find on this page.
[578:43.10]Ring.
[578:43.50]Jump.
[578:50.13]Okay, hold on.
[578:50.69]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[578:53.13]He's gonna jump to the... Where the fuck is it, man?
[579:05.70]Because the only way he can continue to evolve is by getting outside.
[579:07.86]Seaman says he thinks that pesky ring hanging from the upper left of the tank should be the key to getting that.
[579:14.20]He will try to jump to it from the big rock, asking that you say jump for encouragement.
[579:19.02]On his third try, he will reach it and the back panel of the tank will slide down.
[579:26.13]Okay.
[579:27.35]We advance.
[579:30.89]That's 10 community subs from Peekabinanna.
[579:34.21]Thank you, PikaBanana, for the 10 subs.
[579:36.67]That's a lot of subs.
[579:37.55]Thank you.
[579:43.06]Let's go.
[579:47.56]You spoiled the ending.
[579:48.60]Oh, didn't it just say he jumps out of the tank?
[579:50.78]That's all I read.
[579:52.82]Two more days.
[579:54.00]What day was it?
[579:55.76]Five?
[579:56.48]What if I... No, five.
[579:58.14]Right?
[579:59.50]But, PikaBanana, that's a fucking lot of subs.
[580:01.16]Thank you.
[580:09.71]Who cares about Seaman spoilers?
[580:13.71]So we're on four.
[580:15.17]We're now on five.
[580:18.64]Let's go.
[580:19.76]Fuck it.
[580:20.70]Two more jumps.
[580:23.32]See you at ten hours.
[580:24.72]See you at ten hours.
[580:36.61]I need to see the end.
[580:38.11]Because I'd have to be the first person to play it.
[580:40.59]And beat it on stream on regular, regular hardware.
[580:43.09]You know what I mean?
[580:45.75]You might get somebody that streams this game.
[580:47.97]Like, oh yeah, Seaman.
[580:49.11]I heard of that game.
[580:50.05]Didn't that fucking top 1,000 streamer, Jerma985, play that?
[580:55.11]I heard about that through his fucking fantastic stream.
[581:00.34]Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[581:02.86]What I'm going to do on a fucking emulator.
[581:06.05]Greetings, and welcome back.
[581:08.57]You're doing a good job.
[581:10.63]Did it on a regular hardware.
[581:13.38]Very well.
[581:14.70]Do you notice Frogman trying to reach the ring hanging from the ceiling?
[581:19.34]Perhaps this holds the key to the next step in Seaman's development.
[581:27.74]Fate controller?
[581:28.52]Is it?
[581:28.68]Is it?
[581:32.63]Frogmen.
[581:33.29]Just tell them to jump and I'm going to go next day.
[581:35.55]They are suffering from the cold.
[581:37.65]I'll feed them.
[581:38.13]Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[581:45.23]Let me divulge the highlights for today.
[581:49.27]We are nearing the mating season for the frogmen.
[581:52.47]This is something few humans have been pretty good at.
[581:55.03]Just pick them up and put them out of the cage.
[581:57.87]So let us head over to the tank.
[582:06.53]Let's see those credits.
[582:09.57]Jump out.
[582:11.25]Say goodnight.
[582:12.37]Feed them.
[582:13.01]Make sure they're watered.
[582:16.05]End.
[582:16.63]Next day.
[582:17.35]Jump.
[582:17.95]Game over.
[582:18.37]I win.
[582:25.44]It's part of their evolution.
[582:26.30]They have to do it themselves.
[582:33.66]If I get one more conversation about if I'm going to marry my girlfriend or not, or what political spectrum do I lean on, I'm going to shot put one of these frogs.
[582:45.28]Can someone out there put on a sprinkler for me?
[582:48.66]There's not enough moisture here.
[582:51.36]Finally, some service around here.
[582:54.56]It's cold, isn't it?
[583:02.04]Hey, is your girlfriend in the room?
[583:03.52]Oh, she's not in the room.
[583:05.00]Anybody else in the room?
[583:06.08]Have you ever cheated on your girlfriend?
[583:09.88]Fucking... Gone!
[583:16.21]Hey, can you give me something to eat?
[583:19.33]Raise the temperature, would you?
[583:26.95]He's getting defensive about this.
[583:30.13]It's cold in here.
[583:35.29]You would immediately confidently say, no, that's correct, but what the fuck?
[583:38.70]That was wrong to fuck off.
[583:41.42]You got an extra sandwich or something?
[583:44.30]Let's have a time for you.
[583:51.01]Hey, I got some food for you.
[583:52.37]Just kidding, Jay.
[583:57.92]Wow, a seaman could die of hunger in this place.
[584:01.21]I'm kind of hungry.
[584:08.34]It's like manna from heaven.
[584:15.90]Say, you know what would be good right about now?
[584:19.47]Some food.
[584:29.85]Eat it then.
[584:30.53]Enough talking about it.
[584:35.73]I got BTTV.
[584:36.91]Watch.
[584:40.31]I don't know how to do it.
[584:41.19]That was damned yummy.
[584:42.93]I have no idea.
[584:43.89]Alright, I got one more to feed.
[584:48.92]So I do have enough for one more day here.
[584:52.62]More than that.
[584:55.96]Oh, he got... Speaking of being fed...
[584:59.05]Oh, he just fell.
[585:06.73]I have more than enough food for one more day.
[585:12.72]Come here.
[585:13.06]Actually, no.
[585:15.46]There's one right here, right?
[585:18.02]Yeah, I got plenty of fucking food.
[585:19.28]Let's go.
[585:21.26]Go jump.
[585:27.35]Eat that food.
[585:28.67]Try to jump out.
[585:30.45]I'd offer you some, but that would mean less for me.
[585:43.20]Mmm, so good.
[585:44.84]No, it needs a good light so you can see.
[585:46.72]Very good.
[585:47.78]You know how to turn the light on.
[585:49.73]End my suffering.
[585:50.43]I'm trying to get this done fast.
[585:54.97]Okay.
[585:57.13]Jump.
[585:59.09]Jump.
[586:01.29]These early mornings are killing me.
[586:03.42]Go for it, get out.
[586:04.26]You're lucky it's Friday or I'd be really angry.
[586:07.90]Hey, hello.
[586:10.10]You know, today's the anniversary of the premiere of Die Fliedermaus in Vienna.
[586:15.41]Is he alright?
[586:16.19]I'm sure you know the year.
[586:17.41]No, the other way, on the rock.
[586:19.93]Does that count as an attempt?
[586:22.97]Is that two?
[586:23.47]I could go on and on.
[586:29.12]Alright.
[586:30.34]Remember what I told you before about jumping to freedom to find my lost love?
[586:36.48]Well, I've gotten up the nerve and I think I'm ready to try it again.
[586:41.16]So when I say now, say the word jump, okay?
[586:47.35]Here I go.
[586:47.89]One more attempt after this and then we win.
[586:56.83]KXE gave 10 community subs.
[586:58.59]Thank you, KXE.
[587:01.25]There's been a lot of community subs tonight.
[587:02.83]Thank you, guys.
[587:03.31]Thank you so much, KXE.
[587:09.51]Jump.
[587:14.08]See you tomorrow.
[587:25.96]Rhythmically tapping the glass twice a second to keep it going causes the song to start playing.
[587:31.83]What?
[587:36.37]What do you mean rhythmically?
[587:37.85]What do you mean tapping the glass?
[587:39.23]Like... How... That's not right.
[587:49.64]It's during... Okay.
[587:51.26]Goodbye.
[587:51.64]See you tomorrow.
[587:53.56]Bye.
[587:55.21]Be seeing you.
[587:57.77]Twice a second.
[588:00.35]Like... Like that?
[588:05.21]2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, like that.
[588:34.59]This is twice a second.
[588:40.81]Once per second.
[588:43.20]This is two right here.
[588:44.10]Now, I know it's after.
[588:50.34]I'm just trying to get the rhythm down.
[588:51.40]Danny Terrio, eat your heart out.
[588:58.26]Heartbeat with the tapping.
[588:59.44]Wait, you mean like...
[589:24.87]That probably didn't look right because the camera's off.
[589:26.27]That was a pretty good workout.
[589:28.87]The camera's not synced up perfectly.
[589:29.95]Would you like to save and end the session?
[589:39.37]So it's dun-dun, dun-dun, dun-dun, dun-dun, dun-dun, right?
[590:01.04]You should grow a soul patch?
[590:02.16]Alright, sure.
[590:04.03]I'm just going to grow this out like long down here.
[590:07.39]It's going to be like an extra tongue, like a long tongue coming from my mouth.
[590:13.00]There it is.
[590:13.66]Last day.
[590:14.66]Four, six.
[590:15.48]Go for it.
[590:15.86]Okay.
[590:30.97]Here we go.
[590:34.83]He's gonna make it, and I can solidify my house in video game history, whatever.
[590:42.05]It's been 10 hours, give me a break.
[590:59.52]Oh, you made it.
[591:01.16]This is the final day of Seaman.
[591:07.24]Good morning.
[591:07.72]Good morning.
[591:09.94]Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[591:14.94]As you see.
[591:15.48]Greetings.
[591:16.16]Greetings.
[591:16.62]And welcome back.
[591:18.20]You're doing a good job.
[591:22.01]At the moment, the habitat contains two frogmen.
[591:29.57]They are suffering from the cold.
[591:31.94]Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[591:35.60]So let us head over to the tank.
[591:38.15]I'm losing my really great $400,000 a year scientist job for letting out the experiments.
[591:46.64]Do I cause World War 4 because of this?
[592:05.13]World War 4, yeah.
[592:07.03]Because they're just frogs right now.
[592:09.37]It's going to take them probably 40 or 50 years to 100, hundreds of years probably.
[592:14.98]You know how long evolution actually takes?
[592:16.40]It takes like hundreds and hundreds of fucking years.
[592:19.60]So they're going to go into the fucking forest somewhere and start evolving as aliens.
[592:23.88]There's going to be another World War III before 100 years is up.
[592:26.17]It's too dry in here.
[592:27.81]Can't you get the sprinkler going?
[592:29.37]Once they're walking on two legs, we'll be ready for World War III.
[592:34.19]This would be very comfortable if I wanted to live in a desert.
[592:38.72]Oh, yes.
[592:41.00]How about turning up the heat?
[593:01.28]Oh, goody.
[593:06.26]This heater sucks.
[593:12.86]How am I still alive?
[593:14.18]Oh, how are you still alive?
[593:15.38]I was gonna say, I don't know, I'm not that old.
[593:19.20]Alright.
[593:21.02]Final meal.
[593:23.72]So, here you go.
[593:24.94]Good thing I had a good stockpile of food.
[593:36.40]Give it an eat.
[593:37.48]Who's gonna get it?
[593:39.20]Mmm, thanks.
[593:40.12]Okay, bring in the other one.
[593:45.13]Oops.
[593:53.33]Both of you eat.
[593:55.89]Check on the spiders.
[594:07.31]I can't help this one.
[594:08.05]I can't.
[594:12.35]It's fine.
[594:14.57]It's fine.
[594:19.30]It's fine.
[594:27.20]Still an Anor Londo.
[594:40.19]Will you eat that, please?
[594:46.05]Hey, how about adding a little humidity?
[594:48.73]It's good for my skin.
[594:50.89]Um, excuse me, but my stomach is empty.
[594:54.08]There's fucking food right behind you.
[594:56.64]Turn around and eat it.
[594:59.44]Hello?
[595:00.30]Talk to me.
[595:01.60]Time to go.
[595:02.20]Escape.
[595:02.86]Right?
[595:03.18]The rock.
[595:04.04]Jump.
[595:04.44]Morning, sleeping beauty.
[595:05.97]Time for you to jump for that ring.
[595:07.71]And then we're gonna go...
[595:14.28]Go for it.
[595:15.68]Come on, end this.
[595:19.28]Don't keel over around me now.
[595:23.13]Hello?
[595:25.21]Well, hello.
[595:27.31]Jump.
[595:30.88]I really enjoyed talking with you.
[595:33.71]Your relationships seem complex to me, and I don't think it's just because I'm a seaman.
[595:40.97]So many variables.
[595:43.15]So much can happen between different people that life seems like one big jackpot.
[595:48.86]I can tell you one thing, though.
[595:51.14]It's perhaps the only universal truth for all relationships, and that is...
[595:55.89]all of your relationships will one day end.
[595:59.11]Even with your closest companions, things will eventually come to a close, be it by a ridiculous misunderstanding or be it by your own mortality.
[596:09.58]At some given point, you will never speak to each other again, but don't let that frighten you.
[596:16.93]Your precious time on this planet and the relationships you forge are what makes life worth living.
[596:22.45]Instead, appreciate what you have and enjoy the moments of happiness you accumulate.
[596:29.66]Be with the people you want to be with, not who you think you have to be with.
[596:34.78]That will certainly make you a happier human being, you can rest assured.
[596:41.38]Goodbye.
[596:43.08]Go be free.
[596:43.56]Go for it.
[596:47.35]The rock.
[596:47.77]Back there.
[596:48.41]Go... Go jump off the rock.
[596:51.71]It's back there.
[596:53.09]Rock.
[596:56.11]What?
[597:03.34]Rock.
[597:05.94]Jump.
[597:07.94]Adieu.
[597:12.70]Uh...
[597:15.38]Just jump on the rock.
[597:24.83]The same thing happened last time.
[597:25.95]Then he finally was like, no, wrong, up, that, over, on.
[597:32.46]Food.
[597:33.78]Like the food that's behind you that you refuse to turn around and look at.
[597:37.12]Over here.
[597:37.60]It's right here.
[597:38.24]Oh, good.
[597:40.32]Food.
[597:47.56]Come on.
[597:48.02]This just has to end.
[597:52.75]The same thing happened last time.
[597:53.69]He's contemplating.
[597:54.45]He's thinking about it.
[597:55.09]He's going to just pop up and go, I'm going to go for it.
[597:56.89]Here it goes.
[597:57.41]Turn around.
[597:57.75]Turn around.
[597:58.93]Turn around and look at Ruck.
[598:22.48]I'm gonna burn him.
[598:23.22]What do you need?
[598:38.39]Ring.
[598:40.55]I know you're not talking about me.
[598:42.67]Check, um...
[598:48.21]Anyway, I hope this hasn't been too embarrassing for you.
[598:53.45]We'll talk again soon.
[598:57.13]Jump.
[598:59.11]Buh-bye.
[599:01.50]Jump off rock.
[599:02.86]Rock?
[599:15.16]Rock?
[599:31.53]Let's talk.
[599:34.15]Let's talk.
[599:36.02]Talk to me.
[599:37.58]I'm fine.
[599:45.99]Let's talk.
[599:48.67]He's stuck.
[599:50.07]Talk to me.
[599:52.39]Talk to me!
[599:54.54]quiet oh you're very very very you're teetering on the edge of getting fucking Burger King flame broiled in about 10 seconds let's talk hey there are laws against that sort of thing jump
[600:29.41]escape yeah I did like the spice I did let's talk on both of them tomorrow we'll talk again tomorrow oh no just go for it we're gonna have to do another day
[601:03.82]jump don't be a stranger no that's not he doesn't understand jump see you later I think I'm saying bye would you like to save and
[601:45.51]Ryan, finish this.
[601:46.67]Do you guys think I'm trying to drag this shit out?
[601:51.35]I'm trying to end it.
[602:20.19]I'm going to be hearing this in my sleep, yeah.
[602:23.59]Fuck, it's so late.
[602:24.51]It is so late.
[602:26.51]It's almost 2 a.m.
[602:27.33]PST.
[602:28.75]It's almost 5 a.m.
[602:30.81]Eastern.
[602:32.01]Oh, man, I cannot believe.
[602:36.63]I cannot believe there's still almost 3,700 people here.
[602:40.25]Welcome to the laboratory.
[602:41.51]I hope you're enjoying it.
[602:42.29]I hope you're having fun, really.
[602:45.15]You look half dead.
[602:46.13]It seems that visiting around this time has become a habit for you.
[602:51.85]At the moment, the habitat contains two frogmen.
[602:58.89]They are suffering from the cold.
[603:01.26]Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[603:04.86]One of them's gonna jump.
[603:05.92]So let us head over to the tank.
[603:08.60]Oh, well.
[603:14.21]He doesn't give a shit.
[603:15.97]He gave the fuck up, too.
[603:21.31]He's so done with saying all this stuff now.
[603:38.91]Let's check on the tank.
[603:40.53]Let's see exactly what's in there.
[603:42.59]Who gives a shit?
[603:43.67]Just end it, man.
[603:44.95]Resident sleeper.
[603:52.68]This would be very comfortable if I wanted to live in a desert, sprinkling with trees.
[603:56.22]Mmm, just like my Harlem days.
[603:57.18]Hey, it's a bit cold in here.
[603:58.18]I only have enough food for a couple of days.
[603:59.98]Ah, what is wonderful.
[604:00.66]He condensed the two-month game into 11 hours.
[604:23.60]That's so fucking funny.
[604:29.30]Two month, that's like month and, no, just barely a month, right?
[604:39.39]It's a little chilly, don't you think?
[604:45.81]The Tamagotchi had more content?
[604:47.32]I don't know if I believe that.
[604:48.46]It was made out of, like, sticks.
[604:49.80]Hey, I'm getting a little hungry.
[604:52.00]How about some... Uh-oh.
[604:55.60]Only one of you gets to eat, and you better jump.
[605:02.52]I'd offer you some, but that would mean less for me.
[605:09.42]Oh, I'm a fat boy.
[605:16.57]Hey, listen up.
[605:24.14]I'm listening!
[605:27.26]Yes?
[605:33.90]Hello?
[605:34.98]Hello.
[605:36.97]Talk to me.
[605:39.37]Is it breakfast time already?
[605:41.91]What is it with humans and this daylight savings?
[605:46.87]Underwater it's either day or it's night and you don't see us with a rising crime rate.
[605:52.19]Take the hint.
[605:55.47]How about a little nourishment here?
[606:06.25]Talk to me.
[606:08.11]Thanks, I'm not interested.
[606:14.83]Is this poisonous?
[606:38.26]I'm fine.
[606:39.18]I'm good.
[606:39.64]I'm just tired.
[606:48.80]What's wrong with you?
[606:49.67]What are you doing?
[606:50.97]Alright, you both have eaten.
[606:52.83]Eat it.
[607:00.91]And then just go for the jump.
[607:05.46]You're good.
[607:05.70]I'm going to have it.
[607:06.82]That was damned yummy.
[607:08.56]Perfect temperature is 24.
[607:10.34]100 sprinkles.
[607:13.48]Ambient mood lighting.
[607:15.92]What does it take to get you to jump?
[607:17.86]Now, let's try this again.
[607:20.83]You know the drill.
[607:22.33]When I give you the cue, say jump.
[607:25.63]Alright?
[607:27.01]Let's go.
[607:28.91]Here we go.
[607:29.33]This is it.
[607:40.41]And then it's tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, right?
[607:46.99]Here we go.
[607:47.39]I'm ready.
[607:47.82]I've been waiting my whole life for this moment.
[607:51.86]Okay.
[607:52.94]Jump, jump, jump, jump.
[607:58.67]I made it!
[608:14.94]Does the other one get to leave too?
[608:15.82]I have waited a thousand lifetimes for this moment.
[608:37.27]Smell that?
[608:39.79]That's freedom.
[608:40.09]Mmm. Freedom.
[608:45.03]The funny thing is that it's there all the time.
[608:49.08]You don't always realize it when you're bogged down with so many other things, but you're always free as long as you're true to yourself.
[608:57.99]That's where freedom lies.
[608:59.95]Within yourself.
[609:02.47]I wish you and your girlfriend the best of luck.
[609:05.79]Make sure she treats you as well as you treated me.
[609:10.00]Okay.
[609:11.66]I must be off.
[609:13.78]My evolution must continue.
[609:16.16]Oh my.
[609:18.34]I think I know where I am.
[609:19.74]Dump salt on him.
[609:21.60]It's all coming back to me.
[609:24.58]This must be Gassay's island.
[609:28.14]Somewhere on this island is a place I have to go in order to continue evolving.
[609:34.00]I must go find it.
[609:35.98]You know you're alright.
[609:38.19]Oh, that was really loud.
[609:38.93]I'm sorry.
[609:39.47]I know we've had our differences occasionally, but I like you.
[609:45.21]You took care of me all this time, and, well, I'm grateful.
[609:50.14]I will kill you first and divorce painlessly.
[609:52.34]Very grateful.
[609:53.18]In World War IV.
[609:54.78]Well, say something before I start bawling, won't you?
[610:00.08]I hated every second of our experience together, and I hope you get eaten by a fucking snake and somebody pours salt on your balls.
[610:07.98]Hey, listen.
[610:09.28]There's something I'd like to do for you as a kind of thank you.
[610:14.26]It's not much, but I wasn't exactly able to head over to- I don't have very much brain power right now.
[610:20.36]It's just something for you to try someday.
[610:23.46]Did I have the balls part?
[610:24.34]Just try tapping on the glass.
[610:27.08]You know, with the right trigger on your control pad.
[610:29.18]I've reverted to a fucking 14-year-old.
[610:31.22]Tap, tap, tap.
[610:34.22]Try it sometime.
[610:35.60]Okay, friend, this is it.
[610:39.56]I've really got to go now.
[610:42.22]Take care, and if you ever want to talk to me, just call me, okay?
[610:51.19]You've been a good friend.
[610:53.21]I'll miss our time together.
[610:56.33]Don't be a total stranger now.
[610:59.56]So confirm with me that it's tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[611:03.98]Is that correct?
[611:04.92]This is important.
[611:17.85]Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[611:24.83]Tap like this.
[611:25.57]Tap, tap.
[611:27.32]Tap, tap, tap, tap.
[611:49.07]It's tap, tap, tap.
[613:02.24]Every instrument is wrong!
[613:34.03]I can't keep up with it, it's so wrong!
[613:36.23]Oh it's too- my tapping!
[616:17.23]Uh, did I drop a bug?
[616:20.47]No, whoops.
[616:25.94]I'm pooped.
[616:27.12]I'm not the sea man I used to be.
[616:29.12]I thought it was fucking over.
[616:41.82]You were wrong.
[617:20.66]Somebody say tap up the stairs and stop it.
[617:28.41]You understand?
[617:29.15]There's only three different beats.
[617:31.45]There's like this.
[617:34.49]It keeps fucking up.
[617:41.48]See how it's slowing down?
[617:46.08]I haven't changed at all.
[618:30.98]I saw all the content already, so I'm just being fucking lied to!
[618:34.65]I've seen it all!
[618:36.01]This is a- this is a cheat!
[618:37.35]Everyone's fucking with me!
[618:39.04]I've seen it all!
[618:59.04]I'm pooped.
[619:00.22]I'm not the sea man I used to be.
[619:02.20]Tap three times, then not.
[619:22.73]What are you talking about?
[619:24.05]Like...
[619:35.64]It's twice a second.
[619:37.26]So that's... This is two beats a second.
[619:44.14]One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two.
[619:47.38]That's two beats a second.
[620:09.64]Am I never going to get... You understand that... I've done it every way.
[620:12.38]I've done it 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[620:13.52]1, 2, 3, 4.
[620:13.66]1, 2, 3, 4.
[620:13.80]1, 2, 3, 4.
[620:14.00]1, 2, 3, 4.
[620:14.08]1, 2, 3, 4.
[620:14.22]1, 2, 3, 4.
[620:14.34]I've done it every one of those ways.
[620:15.75]I'm going to YouTube this shit so I can fucking scream in everybody's face.
[620:51.02]This doesn't even exist.
[620:52.34]I should just upload it.
[620:55.38]That doesn't exist.
[620:56.27]Nobody's uploaded the end credits to Seaman on YouTube.
[620:58.23]Not one person.
[621:25.50]This fucking shit.
[621:26.42]Do I have to put my live headset on to hear this?
[621:31.37]Fuck!
[621:32.21]No, it's fine.
[621:32.71]It's empty.
[621:37.19]Where is my fucking... I don't even know where it is.
[621:41.45]Do I even have... Where the fuck is this?
[621:45.75]I can't believe I'm still fucking doing this.
[621:53.24]What do you mean have I ever held an instrument before?
[621:54.94]You saw me play Beat Saber like fucking six days ago.
[622:07.55]This one didn't even have the song.
[622:08.51]This person didn't even do the song.
[622:14.32]This person doesn't even do the song.
[622:28.59]They're not even doing the song!
[622:32.21]Metronome Online How many beats per minute do we want?
[622:45.09]We want 120 beats per minute
[622:56.87]I was doing, I was doing this shit.
[622:59.62]Are you kidding me?
[623:01.14]Are you guys, are you serious?
[623:11.37]By the way, by the way, it's not off.
[623:13.39]It's not off.
[623:14.09]It's because, listen, you guys, shut this up for a second so I can explain this.
[623:21.60]I have to delay the audio from the capture card.
[623:25.44]So it's 650 milliseconds faster than the game is here.
[623:30.17]Don't you understand?
[623:30.83]This is what I was doing before.
[623:39.25]You guys can't tell me that.
[623:40.05]I'm out of here.
[623:41.95]I was doing that fucking three straight minutes.
[623:43.73]120 beats per minute.
[623:47.54]You tell me this ain't it?
[623:48.86]I'll do it again.
[623:50.26]Check it out.
[624:40.99]It's so hard to do this when you hear the song because the song is off.
[624:45.03]The song has like so many instruments that are playing and you have to pretend to be in metronome.
[625:13.27]So you can see how fucked up this is, and how fucking, how correct I am.
[625:16.73]Check this shit out.
[625:17.99]You ready?
[625:22.58]Let's hear it.
[625:23.80]Let's get the metronome 120.
[625:24.78]I'll do it at the exact same time.
[625:25.82]120.
[625:31.58]You ready?
[625:38.03]I have to make, I have to queue this up.
[625:40.77]Oh, fuck.
[625:41.25]Hold on.
[625:41.61]Pause it.
[625:42.17]Would you like to save and end the session?
[625:46.63]So I need to delay this by the same amount of time so you can hear it too.
[625:52.29]There you go.
[625:53.19]It should be queued up now.
[625:55.31]Alright, I'm ready for this.
[625:56.19]I'm ready to fucking show you guys once and for all that I bought bullshit in here.
[626:07.91]Ready?
[627:59.82]Did it work?
[628:02.95]Can I get down?
[628:34.84]You guys are fucking with me, man.
[628:37.52]I've been live for 10 and a half hours.
[628:39.66]Yo, you're not on beat.
[628:41.02]How can you not be on beat, you fucking boomer?
[628:44.79]And I'm clearly just going... It was clear as day.
[629:07.15]I got my audio set up to 650 milliseconds delayed, camera delayed, audio delayed.
[629:12.95]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[629:31.12]So the plan is...
[629:36.86]Uh, so I'm not gonna be streaming tomorrow, or technically today.
[629:41.13]Actually, the sus was set for today no stream, but I moved some stuff around, made it possible.
[629:48.41]Hope you had a good time, I had a lot of fun.
[629:49.43]That was an oddly satisfying video game.
[629:54.67]I mean, near the end though, not really.
[629:58.10]But it still was fun to hang out.
[630:05.79]You guys rock.
[630:06.27]Thanks for sticking around.
[630:07.37]I'll see you guys on Tuesday, technically, right?
[630:12.91]Yeah.
[630:16.57]We are going to... We are going to speedfire these bits.
[630:23.05]And by speedfire, I mean go through them fairly quickly.
[630:28.51]That was Seaman.
[630:29.71]Hope you enjoyed it.
[630:30.84]See you on Tuesday.
[630:36.71]Thank you, everybody.
[630:40.69]Oh shit, this really was like an 11 hour stream, damn.
[630:44.61]I usually don't stream for more than like seven, six to eight or so.
[630:47.40]Alright, let's go through them real quick.
[630:51.58]Just because we're very kind of pressed for AM time here.
[630:54.74]Let me make sure I have this set up, which I think I do.
[631:00.99]I think I do.
[631:06.68]Why?
[631:07.04]What's going on with my Twitch?
[631:09.60]Now that's the weird thing.
[631:14.16]Why is my Twitch... What is it doing?
[631:19.56]That was messed up.
[631:23.73]Okay, now I can see it.
[631:25.83]Okay.
[631:30.63]Alright.
[631:33.03]Now I can see everybody.
[631:36.33]Uh, we had HawkeyeMind5Dolls.
[631:37.85]Thank you, Hawkeye.
[631:40.25]I'm so excited to watch this streamer milk this stream about orally transmitted seaman.
[631:44.95]What a dedicated variety streamer.
[631:46.62]Thank you.
[631:48.20]PeacefulHaley, thanks for the $2.50.
[631:49.62]Thanks, PeacefulHaley.
[631:51.76]Uh, was I ever into Mystery Science Theater or Rift Tracks?
[631:54.42]I was.
[631:57.56]I loved Mystery Science Theater back in the day.
[632:02.14]I have not seen any of the new one, the reboot one.
[632:05.36]But with Mike Nelson, I didn't see the super original MST3K, but I did see the ones with Mike Nelson.
[632:12.90]I was a Mike Nelson fan.
[632:20.54]And then he also said, I want to get into coffee, but every time I take a sip, I feel like I'm going to vomit.
[632:24.76]And I put a shit ton of cream and sugar into it, yet it still tastes gross.
[632:29.31]Thing about coffee is you have to... There's really two ways to drink it.
[632:33.35]It's either just straight up, just take, just drink it black.
[632:36.28]Or... Add milk or... I don't... Adding a ton of sugar in coffee... It just makes it... Yeah, I don't, I don't like adding a ton of sugar and a ton of cream to coffee.
[632:48.14]It makes it weird and tastes like a cake.
[632:50.92]If you can't get into coffee, then just drink tea.
[632:53.64]You know, black tea is probably better.
[632:55.34]You probably like the taste of it more.
[632:56.98]Green tea.
[632:59.81]But have a good night.
[633:00.33]Thank you so much.
[633:00.79]Peaceful Haley.
[633:02.17]Casey, thanks for the $2.50.
[633:03.05]If you're going to continue with Dreamcast, I recommend Echo the Dolphin.
[633:06.24]At least I'm going to play Space Channel 5.
[633:09.64]It's still on the menu.
[633:11.48]The original one.
[633:12.10]I have it in the shrink wrap.
[633:14.06]So that's going to have to be a stream in itself.
[633:17.39]But I've never played Echo the Dolphin.
[633:19.97]Finny, thanks for $5.
[633:21.49]Play the Canada OST.
[633:24.83]Thank you for the $5.00.
[633:28.20]And then Flying Muffin Man, again, 100 bucks.
[633:30.22]Thank you.
[633:31.94]They said, hey, you're the best.
[633:32.92]I don't have the attention span to watch streams often, but it's often a treat to see a new video.
[633:36.82]We caught it late earlier, but thank you.
[633:40.52]Really appreciate it.
[633:41.06]Thanks for the 100 bucks.
[633:41.84]Thanks for tons of money.
[633:42.82]You've given a lot of money this week.
[633:46.73]No problem at all.
[633:47.13]And you have another 250 here, saying...
[634:05.52]I mean, that whole thing was made up.
[634:26.57]You were throwing them at me and my table, trying to get my attention.
[634:30.59]You thought it was hilarious, because you kept on going like, STREAM SNIPER!
[634:34.29]And you kept throwing, and it would hit me in the back of the head, and I was ignoring it completely.
[634:45.32]But, you know, I didn't lose my cool, you did.
[634:49.10]Hey, Holly-o, thanks for the, uh, Holly, Holly.
[634:52.32]Thanks for the five bucks.
[634:53.08]Hey, Jerma, I'm in Vegas right now for about a month.
[634:57.10]Just saying that if I see you, I'll be sure to give you a good, firm handshake.
[635:00.86]And not just Jerma suplex you.
[635:02.35]Well, please don't Jerma suplex me if I do end up seeing you around.
[635:06.75]If anybody sees me anywhere, please say hello.
[635:10.81]Welcome to Vegas.
[635:12.91]It's a good town, just be careful.
[635:15.05]Hey, Pigeon, thanks for the $2.50.
[635:16.23]This is actually so damn cute.
[635:19.34]I love you for doing this.
[635:20.58]Seaman is a classic.
[635:22.56]It's great.
[635:27.24]It's so goddamn cute.
[635:29.08]In a very disturbing kind of way.
[635:31.81]But it is still.
[635:33.69]Hey, FreudianWeapon, thanks for the 250.
[635:35.31]Can you give us another condensed history lesson?
[635:37.15]I forgot to study for my test tomorrow.
[635:40.17]Um... War bad.
[635:48.14]Uh, spice trading.
[635:50.10]Trade sugar, tobacco trading.
[635:53.86]Economies.
[635:54.82]Collapses.
[635:57.84]Uh, entrepreneurship.
[636:00.72]Industry.
[636:02.12]Steam.
[636:04.38]Coal.
[636:06.34]Natural gas.
[636:09.28]England?
[636:12.18]England.
[636:14.22]England.
[636:14.62]America.
[636:16.06]America.
[636:18.17]America!
[636:19.87]America.
[636:22.07]Oh, America.
[636:27.13]And now here we are on this stream.
[636:32.91]What about France?
[636:33.61]France!
[636:34.85]France.
[636:35.31]EU.
[636:37.39]Hey, EU.
[636:38.01]EU.
[636:38.47]EU.
[636:38.77]EU.
[636:50.12]Hey, thank you, Divas, for the $3.41.
[636:53.96]Thanks, Divas.
[636:56.38]Derm, I hope you're doing well.
[636:57.26]I just want to say that these are the last bits I can give for now.
[636:59.69]Money's getting kind of tight right now, and I haven't been able to get any bits from ads from the Twitch desktop or on mobile.
[637:06.33]I'm going to still try to stay subbed.
[637:08.67]But yeah, thanks for the great streams and the fantastic content.
[637:11.17]Thank you, Divas.
[637:12.65]You have consistently and constantly given this stream money every single time.
[637:17.86]So, take care of yourself.
[637:19.90]Please make sure that you are doing well first before you even consider giving a cent to this stream.
[637:26.38]But you've been a contributor to, monetarily at least, forever.
[637:31.78]Every single fucking stream.
[637:33.94]So, don't feel sorry about that.
[637:35.68]Don't, um...
[637:39.71]You know, money is getting tight.
[637:41.77]Don't worry about that.
[637:42.61]Don't worry about paying me.
[637:46.53]Take care of yourself.
[637:47.49]Jeremiah Hart, at the end there, thank you so much.
[637:52.95]Niall Orion, thank you for the $3.
[637:55.36]I can't feel my nose.
[637:56.44]Jeremy's son's last words.
[638:01.34]Flying Muffin Man also gave $40 that I missed earlier.
[638:04.90]Shout out to my friend Blue, who's watching.
[638:09.23]Well, hopefully blue stuck around.
[638:10.79]I don't know if blue's still here, but that was 40 more dollars from Flying Muffin Man.
[638:16.17]A lot, a lot, a lot.
[638:18.74]Thank you.
[638:20.94]For your 140 dollars.
[638:23.80]Smelly boy, thanks for the three bucks.
[638:25.12]Jerma, I did the exact same Do You Like America thing you were talking about, but on Omegle.
[638:33.41]I can't even see Omegle.
[638:35.39]That's just Omegle lull to me now.
[638:39.22]Omegle is not even a real word to me now.
[638:46.56]But, yeah.
[638:48.63]Everybody wants to know what people think about him.
[638:51.89]But thank you, Smelly Boy.
[638:52.71]Thank you, Spurgleton.
[638:54.59]We got you, Spurgleton.
[638:56.43]Ten bucks came in, but we'll touch upon it again.
[638:58.59]We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine, and the machine is bleeding to death.
[639:01.61]Hopefully we get out.
[639:08.36]There were a ton of community subs tonight.
[639:11.80]At least 50 to 60, probably even 70.
[639:15.94]You guys are incredibly generous.
[639:17.34]Thank you so much, guys.
[639:20.80]And it's a bunch of different people, too.
[639:22.49]It wasn't just one or two people that gave community subs.
[639:26.43]It was a lot of people, so... Really appreciate it.
[639:28.47]Thank you, guys.
[639:32.13]Uh, thank you to... Thank you to Bunt for the three bucks.
[639:35.71]Are you also going to yell at your children to speak English?
[639:39.83]No, I'm not gonna have any children.
[639:40.91]Don't worry.
[639:43.78]Mostly lost.
[639:44.34]Thanks for the $2.50.
[639:44.70]Now that you stuck the microphone in your mouth, you can say you do eat ass.
[639:50.82]No.
[639:51.86]You can't... I'm sorry, guys.
[639:53.54]You don't second-hand eat ass.
[639:56.88]There's no third-party ass-eating.
[639:59.34]You either do or you don't.
[640:05.37]Hey, Garfield the Monday Killer!
[640:07.01]That's you, Garfield, thanks for the 250.
[640:08.40]I don't know how I feel about having such a strange creature named after me, especially one who seems to have strange backstage dealings.
[640:16.09]Hope he's just a weirdo and not actually some criminal mastermind.
[640:20.02]I'm not here or there, but I'd keep an eye on him if I were you.
[640:23.78]I've had to deal with a few Monday spies in my day.
[640:26.52]If Fish Garfield tries anything fishy, I'll be there to keep him at bay.
[640:31.56]Please applaud that joke.
[640:32.62]Thanks, chat.
[640:33.68]Hey, what's with the minus twos?
[640:35.16]Come on, what do I do?
[640:36.76]Don't boo me.
[640:42.31]Hey, Frozen Crazy Tuna, thanks for the $4.
[640:45.81]Sorry, Twitch chat is bullying you for a fish.
[640:48.41]I wasn't getting bullied.
[640:51.94]This was... I was having a great time.
[640:53.60]This whole stream was a lot of fun.
[640:54.72]We were bullying.
[640:55.64]We were having fun.
[640:58.89]If anything, the fish was bullying me.
[641:01.29]And you guys were laughing at it.
[641:03.57]That's kind of what happened.
[641:06.46]But thank you, FrozenCrazyTuna, for the four bucks.
[641:10.46]And thank you for the message, too.
[641:12.88]I was bullying.
[641:19.23]Uh, Pika Banana gave 10 bucks, uh, as well as subs too, I believe.
[641:23.47]Thank you.
[641:25.01]Yes, you are attractive.
[641:26.01]Have some money.
[641:26.63]Uh, I appreciate that.
[641:29.10]Thank you.
[641:29.88]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[641:30.90]And those are very, very nice words.
[641:34.10]Thanks a lot, Pika.
[641:36.09]Hey, Dork Cube, thanks for the $3.50.
[641:37.59]I'm using spring break as an excuse to buy bits again, and I want to say that this semester so far has been a lot of bullshit.
[641:44.50]A bunch of classes I don't want to take.
[641:47.00]So when I watched you play that VR hoverboard game the other week and slam into the wall, I was reminded what a wonderful world we live in.
[641:54.09]I love you too to keep making people laugh their asses off.
[641:56.51]Thank you.
[641:59.24]Sorry I have to take classes you don't want to take.
[642:01.62]Unfortunately, a lot of schools have the mandatory credits that you have to take, right?
[642:07.62]And it can be annoying.
[642:09.94]What a wonderful world!
[642:11.86]Me crashing into a wall.
[642:16.92]Any joy that you take from this stream, I keep saying it and I sound like a broken record, but that means a lot.
[642:21.78]I'm glad that you can take a load off and have some fun here.
[642:27.05]Thank you, Dorkube.
[642:27.95]Good luck in school.
[642:29.13]Good luck in the rest of your classes.
[642:32.15]Hey, Felix!
[642:33.07]Felix, thanks for the $5.20.
[642:34.29]Thank you, Felix.
[642:36.13]Hey, Jerma.
[642:36.57]Us in the Discord have reached a consensus on the new emote.
[642:39.28]It should be Jerma Korn.
[642:45.86]No.
[642:49.40]No, I'm not going to put that as an emote.
[642:50.93]Sorry.
[642:53.21]No.
[642:57.57]That's just a piece of corn.
[643:00.58]That's just a cursed corn.
[643:03.72]Appreciate the effort, though, guys.
[643:06.72]It's Time for Slime gave three, six, nine, almost ten dollars here.
[643:12.38]Thank you, It's Time for Slime.
[643:13.30]They say, thanks to you, I'm not addicted to Picross.
[643:18.92]No, thanks to you, I am addicted to Picross.
[643:21.83]It's ruining my life.
[643:23.73]Also, please activate the stupid stream legends loop.
[643:30.36]I will, I will.
[643:31.18]Alright.
[643:31.68]They say now.
[643:34.49]I will activate the stream legends loot.
[643:37.73]Thanks for the nearly 10 bucks here.
[643:38.89]It's time for slime.
[643:39.45]Appreciate it.
[643:42.45]Never trust a purple.
[643:43.29]What's going on purple?
[643:45.49]$20 from never trust a purple.
[643:47.43]Jerma ate ergo fungus on his pizza and is now tripping from naturally produced LSD.
[643:56.50]Oh yeah, I did.
[643:57.00]I ate a pizza on stream.
[643:58.20]It's been a long time.
[644:00.61]It's almost been like a full day on stream.
[644:05.08]I forgot that I ate a pizza like four and a half hours ago.
[644:10.84]I ate a whole pizza on stream.
[644:15.38]Five hours is 24 hours?
[644:17.02]What do you mean five hours?
[644:18.58]This is almost an 11 hour stream.
[644:26.99]Five hours!
[644:29.86]I say 10, 40, am I crazy?
[644:32.11]It's only been 10 minutes.
[644:36.05]No, I don't count that.
[644:41.42]Here's why.
[644:42.85]A day to me is not while you're sleeping.
[644:45.40]Now, sure, there are 24 hours in a day, but when you get up, you're usually awake for about 15 to 18 hours, right?
[644:55.08]So 24 hours is a whole day, but you're not awake, you're asleep.
[645:02.23]A waking day is like VR Josh, it's about 16 hours.
[645:05.95]So I've spent almost the entire waking day on stream.
[645:08.35]You know, not when you're in bed.
[645:20.11]I've said this before and I will reiterate it as many times as I want to.
[645:23.11]I don't know how the fuck people do this shit.
[645:27.83]How do you stream?
[645:29.85]Because I'm going to give you some insight here.
[645:32.53]When you think about streaming and you think about how, you know, sitting here in a chair with a camera on or with something on the screen and you're talking and you're engaging, right?
[645:42.54]And for breaks, right?
[645:43.86]Maybe I'll go to take a piss like two or three times a stream, right?
[645:48.43]It's not like, oh, I'll be back in like 40 minutes, right?
[645:51.25]Like, I'll see you guys in an hour.
[645:53.77]How do people sit here and live broadcast and entertain people for 12 straight hours, like every single day?
[646:05.96]I can't even imagine doing that.
[646:14.16]I know, and everybody doesn't do that, but I know there's a lot of people that come pretty close.
[646:26.41]They do it by being boring.
[646:30.38]Oh.
[646:36.00]Yeah, but even if you're the most... You could be sitting there... Like, think about when you guys sit there and, like, let's just say playing a video game, right?
[646:45.20]Even sitting down and playing a game for 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 hours straight...
[646:52.09]It takes a toll anyways, you know, even if you were not on a stream anyway, if you were sitting there just by yourself.
[646:59.40]People do these 24-hour streams, they do these, like, marathons, sit in the chair for 20 hours.
[647:04.34]I don't know how you function.
[647:15.63]It's just focusing on the game and less interactivity.
[647:22.25]I mean, I'm not... I'm not dogging it.
[647:24.39]I'm just saying, it's... That's next level.
[647:30.04]To broadcast consistently more than 10 hours of stream.
[647:42.90]I can only go for about 8 hours straight and I forget to eat.
[647:45.24]Yeah.
[647:50.52]Interesting stuff.
[647:53.82]But let's keep going.
[647:54.46]We're getting pretty close.
[648:00.58]I zoned out and played Starbound for 19 hours once.
[648:07.73]That's so long.
[648:11.15]You gotta get unplugged.
[648:12.69]Someone's gonna come into your room and pull the cord out of the back of your computer.
[648:16.43]At that point, you're like... You have to get woken up.
[648:19.79]You gotta get shaken awake at that point.
[648:25.51]But, bingo, sunshine, thanks for the five bucks.
[648:27.13]Jerma, please get a haircut.
[648:28.07]You look like Tim Buckley from the webcomic Control-Alt-Delete.
[648:31.39]It's not the first time either.
[648:33.71]But, loss, LOL.
[648:34.85]Seriously, thank you for streaming today.
[648:38.40]It doesn't matter how I do my hair.
[648:39.66]It's always gonna look like shit.
[648:41.88]No, it doesn't.
[648:42.32]It looked good in the beginning of the stream.
[648:45.56]Uh, call me divide.
[648:47.16]Thanks for the five bucks.
[648:49.40]Jerma, I'm glad that you get to do what you love every day.
[648:51.87]Congrats on the fastest pizza world record.
[649:04.48]Thank you, CallMeDivide.
[649:07.88]No, I love this shit.
[649:08.72]I'm fucking as happy as a goddamn clam.
[649:13.47]What does that even mean?
[649:15.59]Somebody look up the origins of that phrase.
[649:17.01]I don't know what it means.
[649:20.87]But thank you, CallMeDivide.
[649:21.75]Thank you, MJ.
[649:23.29]Thank you, MJ Wodge for the $2.50.
[649:26.54]Pizza joke was worth it.
[649:30.20]Oh my god.
[649:36.82]Why do I look 60 in this picture?
[649:42.71]I look like a 65-year-old lion person.
[649:53.01]I look like the actor that plays Ebenezer Scrooge without the makeup on.
[650:04.93]Ugh.
[650:06.94]Fucking old.
[650:08.48]Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.
[650:10.38]Thanks for the $5.
[650:11.60]How much do I have to donate for you to peak the mic?
[650:15.65]I don't know, like $1,000 probably.
[650:17.53]So I can just get a new one.
[650:22.55]I'm serious.
[650:23.37]I'm not kidding.
[650:24.17]No, no, no.
[650:24.67]Stop, stop, stop.
[650:25.27]I'm kidding.
[650:28.86]I'm not going to peek the mic.
[650:30.46]I told you, no amount of money is going to make me peek the mic.
[650:33.70]If somebody gives $1,000 right now, I'm not going to do it.
[650:35.92]I want to make that very clear.
[650:37.20]That was a joke.
[650:38.84]That was a joke.
[650:39.40]It's not going to fucking happen.
[650:40.35]Don't do it.
[650:43.57]I can promise you that I will not do that.
[650:45.39]You need to know that.
[650:47.71]And plus, stream's over anyways.
[650:48.67]Good night.
[650:54.13]Will you do it though?
[650:54.85]No, I won't.
[650:55.75]I'm not going to do it.
[650:58.29]Hey Jules, thanks for the 250.
[650:59.67]If Otto were to talk this way, would you treat him any differently?
[651:03.53]No, probably not.
[651:05.63]Uh-oh.
[651:07.01]Brolux in the chat.
[651:10.75]Uh-oh.
[651:20.33]Hey!
[651:21.07]Thank you to PikaPanana again for the 10 bucks.
[651:26.65]You're a good person, Jermahart.
[651:28.27]I hope you weren't too uncomfortable with all those questions the frogman asked you about religion and politics.
[651:32.56]No, I'm just kidding around.
[651:33.24]It was fun.
[651:34.96]I had a good time.
[651:37.02]It's always a blast.
[651:40.86]But thank you, PikaBanana, for your subs and your large amount of monetary bits here.
[651:45.71]It means a lot.
[651:46.87]Thank you.
[651:49.21]SinaBunny, thanks for the $18, SinaBunny.
[651:53.29]This is the best thing I've ever watched.
[651:54.69]Thanks for making my day every day.
[651:59.38]That's... Thank you, Cinnabunny.
[652:03.67]Thank you for the nearly $20.
[652:04.95]Thanks for hanging out.
[652:06.98]I'm glad you enjoy yourself here.
[652:11.77]Hell yeah, thank you.
[652:15.24]Also, thank you to Jules again for the $25,250.
[652:17.76]That's $2.50.
[652:20.29]This 1998 video game, Manfrog, has inspired me to come up with political and religious questions to ask Jerma for the next fan meet and greet.
[652:31.37]So excited.
[652:33.25]I won't answer it.
[652:33.87]I'll just be like, eh, I don't know.
[652:35.08]Oh, there's Broluck.
[652:38.88]Broluck, thanks for the $2.50 here.
[652:41.36]It's a Twitch clip.
[652:42.44]Let's see what it is.
[652:50.34]Do I think the girlfriend is... Wait, wait, what was it?
[652:53.00]Oh, it's the girlfriend clip.
[652:54.16]What about Egypt?
[652:55.38]Love.
[653:08.64]It's true.
[653:09.14]No, that's a heavy question to ask anybody.
[653:11.82]Imagine if you knew, okay, you meet up with some friends.
[653:16.24]You hang out with some friends maybe you haven't seen in a long time.
[653:18.50]You know that your buddy's got a girlfriend and you go out to dinner or something and there's like 6,000 of you, okay?
[653:26.01]You're at a big dinner.
[653:27.01]There's a lot of people there.
[653:28.89]And in front of those 6,000 people,
[653:33.04]I stand up and I point to the couple that's been together for a couple of years and I say, hey, everybody, can I have your attention?
[653:41.33]I go, excuse me, everybody, can I have your attention, please?
[653:46.89]And everyone just fucking stops eating, puts this shit down.
[653:48.95]It's like we're at a wedding and they look over here and I go, I just want to have a quick question to ask our two cute couple here.
[653:57.27]Is she the one?
[653:58.07]Are you getting married?
[654:00.82]It's going to be like, and you look around, there's fucking thousands of eyeballs.
[654:09.84]What would you do?
[654:18.21]That's a pretty reasonable response.
[654:22.11]And if you say yes, that's a ton of weight too.
[654:24.01]That's true.
[654:26.41]Because then you got 6,000 witnesses that are like, well, can't wait to see them married.
[654:31.15]And what if it doesn't happen?
[654:32.03]Then those 6,000 people all expect you to get married.
[654:36.20]And what if it doesn't happen?
[654:37.36]And then you look like a dickhead.
[654:41.06]You show up like three years later with some new girlfriend.
[654:44.71]You said you were going to marry that other girl.
[654:47.68]Oh, wow, I was one of the 6,000 fucking people that were at the farmer's market that day that you showed up.
[655:00.11]That's 6,000 wedding gifts you can steal.
[655:05.49]And you look like a dickhead for saying no.
[655:06.97]That's right.
[655:07.51]So I don't know.
[655:08.57]Maybe, who knows?
[655:09.63]I'm going to let the world, the wind take me wherever it takes me.
[655:13.67]That's the correct answer.
[655:17.81]But thank you, Broluck.
[655:19.67]Hey, FrodeanWeapon, thanks for the 250.
[655:20.85]Wow, this frog man is really calling you out tonight.
[655:25.10]Yeah.
[655:27.00]Yeah, he was.
[655:28.90]Topac, thanks for the three bucks.
[655:30.88]Not sure how your brain was able to endure such brain fuckery for this long.
[655:33.84]If you had any IQ before this stream, it's surely gone now.
[655:38.18]And people are giving me shit, but not being able to keep, like, a beat.
[655:42.30]I got 11 hours of being told a bunch of dog shit.
[655:47.61]I had to sit there for 11 hours and have somebody berate me on stream.
[655:52.51]And I can't like press the button quick enough?
[656:04.54]I had 8 hours of sleep during your stream.
[656:13.94]That's a full night's sleep.
[656:16.14]When did you start watching?
[656:17.16]The stream was only 11 hours long.
[656:18.66]Did you just get here, like, 20 minutes ago?
[656:20.32]A full night's sleep.
[656:26.32]Oh, that's so funny.
[656:35.76]Thank you, Topek.
[656:36.46]Thank you, Frodeon.
[656:40.02]We also had KXZ.
[656:42.08]Thank you, KXZ, for the $30.
[656:45.68]30 bucks from KXE.
[656:46.40]It's almost 9am over here.
[656:48.22]But I don't regret staying up for you.
[656:49.60]Easily one of your best streams to date.
[656:51.62]Keep on keeping on, man.
[656:55.30]You think this is one of the best streams?
[656:56.48]Thank you.
[656:59.53]I sleep through every Jerma stream.
[657:06.93]Thanks for the 30 bucks, KXE.
[657:08.45]Thanks for the subs.
[657:09.51]Thanks for everything.
[657:15.84]I really appreciate it.
[657:19.74]Freudian Weapon, thank you for the $5.
[657:21.06]They say Germahart BibleThump.
[657:26.43]BibleThump?
[657:26.93]Why?
[657:28.77]Topac, thanks for the $2.50.
[657:29.75]I miss Shito.
[657:30.75]Please show him so I can know he's okay.
[657:32.51]I've been calling him for weeks and no answer.
[657:34.65]I'm going to call the Child Protection Services.
[657:37.49]He's fine.
[657:42.20]He's on a retreat right now.
[657:49.28]He'll be back, don't worry.
[657:51.96]And then PikaBanana came in with 30 bucks.
[657:57.25]On top of everything else.
[657:58.63]PikaBanana, this is like 200 fucking dollars tonight.
[658:06.50]With all the subs too?
[658:09.56]How many subs did you give?
[658:11.02]You gave like 10, 20, 30 community subs too?
[658:17.58]It's a lot, whatever it is.
[658:18.44]It's definitely up there.
[658:21.30]Thank you, PicoBanana.
[658:25.54]And you say, thanks for the stream today, Jerma.
[658:27.38]This is the first full stream I've been able to watch, and it was fun from start to finish.
[658:33.33]You never failed to make us all laugh, and you never failed to brighten my day.
[658:35.85]Please keep it up and get some rest.
[658:37.71]This was a really long stream, jermaHeart.
[658:44.13]Thank you.
[658:49.98]Incredibly nice thing to say, a bunch of fucking money.
[658:55.34]I am spoiled rotten.
[658:59.28]It means a lot though, guys, really.
[659:00.66]Thank you.
[659:04.69]You've been live for just over 11 hours.
[659:06.55]By this point, you should have consumed at least 44 ounces of water.
[659:09.95]I have not had even remote... 1.3 liters of water?
[659:12.81]I drank a Coke.
[659:19.29]How much water?
[659:19.91]This is 12 ounces.
[659:22.41]No, I had a drink in here.
[659:29.32]I've had like probably 20... I've probably had like 25 ounces of water.
[659:34.92]Coke is negative water.
[659:35.97]I'll go drink a full fucking Gatorade bottle.
[659:39.31]Yeah, I do have Gatorade.
[659:44.45]Coke sugar detracts your water.
[659:48.58]I'm gonna go drink one of those big, goofy, I'm sick Gatorades.
[660:02.17]Sugar compacts your body.
[660:03.87]Maybe.
[660:09.21]You took better care of the frog.
[660:20.49]Killer Crocomire, thank you.
[660:22.93]Should raid or host someone?
[660:25.33]Uh, I don't even know if it's gonna be streaming.
[660:26.43]Who's still streaming right now to do a host to?
[660:29.27]Or do a raid to?
[660:31.49]I like to raid more than I like to host.
[660:33.17]Because raiding feels more like, hey, let's go.
[660:38.76]Hosting kind of just happens.
[660:40.88]I'd rather just, like, raid.
[660:43.44]Than be like, this is what we're gonna do, we're gonna raid this person tonight, and here we go.
[660:49.24]Is Criken streaming right now?
[660:52.88]Who the hell is it?
[660:53.50]I gotta take a look at the list.
[660:57.22]But, uh, thank you to Exifer for the $2.50.
[660:59.86]Local crazed and deranged streamer plays demonic off-tempo song to thousands at 4 a.m.
[661:06.57]It was off-tempo, and I wasn't even- wasn't even my fault.
[661:10.83]Hey Rainy David, thanks for the five bucks.
[661:13.36]You should play Catherine on stream so we can see you answer more difficult questions.
[661:20.10]I've never played it.
[661:20.70]Isn't that the one where you Q-Bert up a wall?
[661:25.87]Right?
[661:28.39]It's like reverse Q-Bert.
[661:30.19]It's like you climb walls and shit.
[661:31.79]I don't know, maybe.
[661:39.85]I haven't really given it a look.
[661:45.06]Yeah, I'm gonna probably say no, though.
[661:46.60]Probably not.
[661:48.77]Hey Novi, thanks for the free 33, $3.33.
[661:51.77]Can't believe you actually finished this game.
[661:53.25]This is going to make for a great second Jerma video.
[661:57.26]Well, they have 11 hours to work with.
[662:00.74]We'll see what they come up with.
[662:06.30]Almost, only a few more left.
[662:08.42]This washing machine, thanks for the three bucks.
[662:11.21]Thanks so much for the late night stream, Jerma.
[662:12.63]Makes staying up studying for exams way easier.
[662:15.05]Good luck on your exams.
[662:17.69]And glad to... Glad to keep you company for a while while you're studying.
[662:22.95]Good luck.
[662:25.71]You should have played this game connected to the polygraph machine.
[662:30.23]An 11-hour polygraph.
[662:33.33]You know how much money that would cost?
[662:39.24]Get somebody to sit here and fucking make sure the questions are done correctly?
[662:43.28]That would be like... Six grand.
[662:49.60]That'd be a long paper.
[662:56.63]Hey, can I take an 11-hour polygraph, please?
[663:03.85]So one stream worth of bits.
[663:05.77]I don't know.
[663:09.24]Not that much.
[663:14.46]But, uh... Thank you, this watch machine.
[663:16.60]Good luck.
[663:18.17]For all luck, thanks for the $2.50.
[663:19.39]If you don't scream into your mic, I will donate money.
[663:21.49]I'm not going to scream, and I'm not going to not scream.
[663:24.47]No money needs to be involved.
[663:25.53]I'm not going to do it.
[663:26.81]I'm not going to get paid to do it, and I'm not going to get paid not to do it.
[663:31.30]It's not going to happen.
[663:32.06]I'm not going to do it.
[663:33.48]Neither one of those things is going to happen.
[663:36.56]Cool the sniper.
[663:37.22]Thanks for the $2.50.
[663:37.98]I'm heading out.
[663:38.46]Good night.
[663:39.24]Hopefully I caught you right here.
[663:40.38]Have a great night.
[663:44.51]So, was that a real doctor during the polygraph stream?
[663:46.61]That's Dr. Schmoytson.
[663:50.15]Just because you don't have credentials doesn't mean you can't be a real doctor.
[664:01.91]Uh, but thank you, Siroc, for the 250.
[664:03.75]Kenshi Frogman versus Seaman Frogman at Jerma Rumble.
[664:06.95]Probably.
[664:08.99]Probably.
[664:11.65]That's a pretty good idea.
[664:14.42]And then finally we had KXZ for another $10.
[664:16.64]Thank you, KXZ.
[664:19.17]And finally, Talamak, thanks for the $2.50 at the very end here.
[664:23.00]Hey Jerma, I missed most of the stream.
[664:24.40]Can you play it again tomorrow?
[664:26.42]Or just do it one more time?
[664:29.94]Aye.
[664:32.94]Proluck, what are you doing?
[664:36.16]Holy shit, look at these subs.
[664:38.94]These are all the new subs and all the resubs.
[664:40.41]Thank you, everybody.
[664:41.83]That's going fast as hell.
[664:46.29]That's a lot of subs.
[664:48.79]Broluck, I'm disappointed in you.
[664:50.47]That's what he said to me.
[664:52.31]And frankly, you don't have to give me that $100.
[664:56.39]For what?
[664:57.23]Because I didn't do it?
[664:57.91]I'm not going to scream into the mic.
[665:00.55]I'm not going to do it.
[665:06.46]I didn't... Yeah, I didn't have to give it to you.
[665:11.90]Well, regardless, that's a shitload of money.
[665:14.34]Thank you.
[665:18.16]You've given so much money over the last fucking decade.
[665:21.92]It's been almost a decade.
[665:23.90]Lower the mic and scream.
[665:25.02]No, this is a nice microphone.
[665:26.18]You can damage a mic that is this high quality by screaming as loud as you can into it.
[665:31.54]You can.
[665:31.92]This is not just like a headset microphone.
[665:33.98]This isn't a Seaman microphone.
[665:35.49]I will break this mic and have to order a new one.
[665:39.33]And it's nice.
[665:40.51]And it's... Why is there a 5.8 emote?
[665:47.48]Did you make that just to... Oh, okay.
[665:51.62]I was like, what the fuck is going on?
[666:05.41]I will see you guys on Tuesday.
[666:06.79]Thanks for sticking around.
[666:07.55]Thanks for staying for this longer stream.
[666:11.59]We saw the end of Sea Man.
[666:13.31]We actually got to the credits.
[666:19.00]See you soon.
[666:25.20]God damn, that's a lot of subs.
[666:26.38]Let's see who's streaming right now.
[666:28.80]Who's live right now?
[666:30.32]Let's see.
[666:32.81]Criken and Joel are both live.
[666:38.56]Um, let's go say hi to Criken.
[666:40.32]We haven't raided or hosted Criken in a while.
[666:45.22]We've raided Joel a couple times here in the last couple weeks.
[666:47.57]Let's go say hi to Criken.
[666:48.77]You said Criken is cosplaying?
[666:58.33]What are you doing?
[667:01.27]What is he playing?
[667:02.72]For a second I thought it said auto chess.
[667:06.10]No, it is auto chess.
[667:07.16]Pfft.
[667:17.86]Joel is ending.
[667:19.08]Just go scream at Criken.
[667:21.58]Loot the loot the loot!
[667:22.63]Right right right.
[667:32.09]Criken also is apparently drunk.
[667:35.47]So I may be sending you to a drunk stream.
[667:40.19]Just be aware of that.
[667:42.74]I'll give you the loot.
[667:43.40]Hold on.
[667:43.72]Let me just open up my dashboard.
[667:50.58]If you're playing stream legends on the little dash down there.
[667:59.67]I am about to give a gift, which is every stream pretty much, every 24 hours I can come in here and give everybody a present.
[668:10.13]So, if you're into it, then open it, because it's coming in about 15 seconds.
[668:19.00]And it should be there right now.
[668:21.58]There you go, new gear.
[668:25.88]What level is it?
[668:26.58]Do we have like a guild, right?
[668:28.08]What level is the guild?
[668:35.19]Is it an extension?
[668:35.87]Yeah, it's all the way at the bottom of the page.
[668:37.07]I buried it so it wouldn't take up any real estate.
[668:42.18]Level 36, damn.
[668:44.92]That's pretty good.
[668:46.33]Alright.
[668:47.16]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[668:48.72]Go say hello to Criken.
[668:50.42]Go encourage them to be good at auto-chess.
[668:54.30]I don't.
[668:54.80]I don't know anything about auto-chess.
[668:56.40]All I know is that people like it.
[668:57.98]And it's kind of reminiscent of the old Warcraft 3 mods.
[669:03.09]I have no idea.
[669:04.79]Go say hello.
[669:07.69]Let's get it queued up.
[669:14.04]See you Tuesday.
[669:16.00]Thanks for sticking around.
[669:18.72]I just heard myself.
[669:19.38]That was weird.
[669:20.27]Alright.
[669:20.67]Good night.
[669:21.01]Goodbye.
[669:21.43]Good luck.
[669:21.71]See you later.
[669:24.43]Cue up.
[669:30.71]Ready to raid Krygan in 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[669:33.14]Cue it up.
[669:33.50]Good night, guys.
