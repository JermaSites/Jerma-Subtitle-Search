[01:38.21]Good evening.
[01:39.03]How are you?
[01:40.49]Hi.
[01:42.81]Yeah, he's a little late, but... Listen, listen, listen.
[01:47.61]I had to wait around for Etalyx.
[01:52.12]Etalyx is gonna... We're gonna play a multiplayer game.
[01:54.18]Just everybody calm down.
[01:55.22]Everybody just hold on.
[01:57.88]It's only 727.
[01:58.66]There's a 7 in there.
[02:00.62]There's two 7s in there.
[02:03.56]I'm not late.
[02:04.17]I'm extra on time.
[02:05.23]727. 727.
[02:11.18]Two of the three numbers is seven.
[02:14.36]Come on.
[02:18.37]Anyway.
[02:19.93]Yes, hi.
[02:20.79]Welcome.
[02:28.44]This is what we're playing tonight.
[02:30.02]We are not playing any other game.
[02:33.66]So get your necks out before I fucking delete the goddamn emote in like two days.
[02:41.87]Hey, get your necks out, because that emote's going to be buried in like fucking three or four, five, two days.
[02:56.32]Alright.
[02:58.58]Yeah, get, get, got it, got it, got it, get it out, get it out there, come on, let's see it, come on, get it out there, guys, come on, let's see it.
[03:05.75]Necks, necks, I want to see more necks.
[03:09.35]It's getting replaced with a clown nose.
[03:17.53]No, the reason why we're playing Army of Two is because it's a... the whole game... Listen to me.
[03:22.28]Listen to me.
[03:23.32]Listen to me.
[03:24.64]The whole game is a co-op game.
[03:26.94]It's a game that we haven't played.
[03:28.90]I haven't played this with anybody.
[03:30.18]This is a solely co-op experience.
[03:33.08]So, I'm going to bring a friend along and we're going to play this entire co-op game together.
[03:39.51]That's how it works.
[03:41.56]Anyways.
[03:43.16]Give me one minute while I get set up.
[03:45.27]I gotta get a Etalyx in the call.
[03:46.31]We're gonna go.
[03:50.11]Here we go.
[03:51.20]See you in a minute.
[04:25.10]Okay.
[04:26.33]Let's pull this over here.
[04:28.51]Show the game.
[04:31.15]Okie dokie.
[04:32.61]Okay.
[04:35.02]Angry gamer incoming.
[04:36.00]Why would I be an angry gamer?
[04:38.26]Like, is it expected that I'm an angry gamer?
[04:42.82]Etalyx, shut up, Etalyx.
[04:44.24]Be quiet.
[04:44.82]Hey guys, what's up?
[04:48.03]Etalyx is like saying, yeah, hi, yes.
[04:51.43]I hope you're ready to go.
[04:53.45]Are you ready to play this game, Etalyx?
[04:55.39]Do you know anything about the game?
[04:57.21]Okay, good.
[04:59.00]Yes.
[05:00.34]Yes, yes.
[05:01.82]Why are you being so weird?
[05:03.58]Alright, let's do it.
[05:06.44]Campaign mode.
[05:07.61]Here we go.
[05:12.59]We are doing... We're supposed to be doing a private co-op game.
[05:19.45]Should I do private co-op?
[05:21.57]You can't go BRB now.
[05:27.45]You can't go BRB.
[05:29.09]You cannot go BRB.
[05:30.75]Just fucking stay here for a second.
[05:33.44]Please.
[05:34.32]No.
[05:35.20]Okay, well.
[05:37.18]Let's go.
[05:41.48]You can't BRB for the second you get in here.
[05:44.32]That's not how it fucking works.
[05:49.04]Is this a challenge for you?
[05:49.78]This is not a challenge for you.
[05:54.99]Like, oh, good job, EA.
[05:55.99]You have fucking, like, servers.
[05:57.80]You have servers that fucking work.
[05:59.50]Excellent job, EA.
[06:00.60]EA, you're pretty much like a fucking awful dynasty.
[06:03.22]What, you're not like the Patriots, that's for sure.
[06:06.16]That was barely a joke.
[06:08.42]That was barely a joke.
[06:10.20]Come on, I gotta fucking get in there.
[06:14.12]Let's go.
[06:14.48]Did that work?
[06:18.68]Hey.
[06:20.76]It worked.
[06:21.82]No, it didn't.
[06:24.42]Okay, it worked, it worked, it worked.
[06:26.76]We got in.
[06:28.28]Okay, who do you want to be?
[06:29.94]Do you want to be Rios or Salem?
[06:31.13]Yes.
[06:32.89]Okay, I'm going to be Rios.
[06:35.57]We're going to just do the regular difficulty.
[06:38.63]There's no reason to- should we do normal difficulty or what?
[06:41.85]Yeah.
[06:41.99]What do you think?
[06:43.21]Okay.
[06:43.57]We'll just do the- we'll just do normal.
[06:46.23]Yeah, use this.
[06:46.75]Okay, that's fine.
[06:51.23]Do you have- do you have a, uh... Do you have, like, an Xbox 360 account?
[06:55.58]Or, like, what?
[06:58.80]You do.
[06:59.18]That's good.
[06:59.78]Okay.
[07:00.60]Well, looks like you're a fucking idiot.
[07:01.68]Shut up.
[07:02.94]You shut up.
[07:03.56]You fucking idiot.
[07:04.18]We're playing a fucking co-op game here.
[07:06.16]You shut up.
[07:06.94]Ha ha ha.
[07:09.38]We're having some fun here playing Army of Two together.
[07:14.20]Alright, listen up.
[07:15.12]Alright, everybody quiet.
[07:15.90]This is combat.
[07:19.23]You can die in combat.
[07:20.61]I got to go.
[07:21.41]Quiet.
[07:22.31]If you don't want to die, you have to use aggro.
[07:26.37]We got to use aggro.
[07:27.52]This is you.
[07:28.44]Yeah, Roger that, aggro.
[07:29.02]This is your partner.
[07:31.50]These are enemies.
[07:32.54]Got it.
[07:33.72]You shoot at them, attract their attention, they're going to shoot at you.
[07:38.14]Not your partner.
[07:40.00]Let's say you both shoot at me.
[07:42.12]If your partner has a bigger gun, the enemy will sit down over here.
[07:45.48]Oh yeah, look out, watch out for the enemies.
[07:47.66]Fucking ridiculous.
[07:49.48]If your partner has all the aggro, you're basically invisible.
[07:53.27]You can sneak around enemies, do whatever you want.
[07:56.23]But if you have the aggro, it's like you're glowing red.
[08:04.05]I'm going to be glowing red.
[08:07.29]Do you understand how this works, Doug?
[08:09.75]Uh... I guess that's how it works.
[08:15.07]Yeah, what's up?
[08:17.87]Are you ready to do this?
[08:19.27]Alright, let's go.
[08:20.11]So you're going to follow me.
[08:23.65]So you're holding Y, vault over an obstacle.
[08:25.71]Press Y. Make sure you press Y. Now we've got to cutscene immediately.
[08:31.05]Shut up!
[08:33.41]I'm just telling you what we're watching on the screen here.
[08:35.66]Man, Army of Two really takes me back.
[08:37.84]Came out what, like 2008?
[08:38.86]Back when Gamefly was still relevant?
[08:42.23]That's how I played it anyway.
[08:43.33]I think I played it a couple years after it came out.
[08:45.83]Because I was in college when Army of Two came out.
[08:48.70]And I remember playing Fable 3.
[08:51.04]I was playing it exclusively for achievements, and I was so hardcore in getting the achievements that I was frequently visiting xbox360achievements.com.
[09:00.61]It wasn't .com, but it was something like that.
[09:02.31]They had forums there, and I had to get one achievement that was just elusive.
[09:06.07]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[09:10.17]We got a blind fire here.
[09:11.17]Hold on.
[09:14.10]Give me one second.
[09:16.87]Have you figured out how the fucking controls yet?
[09:24.12]Place your partner in aggressive hold.
[09:25.58]Wait, I have to put you in like a hold or something?
[09:30.03]Alright, so you're gonna stay right there.
[09:32.83]Yes.
[09:33.11]Are you staying there?
[09:34.27]Good.
[09:36.35]So now you're in aggressive mode, apparently.
[09:41.61]I don't know what you're thinking right now, but this is all real.
[09:43.42]Yeah, this is live.
[09:43.78]I don't know what the fuck you guys are talking about.
[09:45.02]It's live.
[09:47.69]I'm going to take a guide on and a turret.
[09:50.45]Okay.
[09:55.19]Are you holding left bumper?
[09:56.13]Because left bumper doesn't do anything.
[09:57.21]Look, okay, I'm hitting left bumper.
[09:58.63]This is what's happening.
[10:03.35]Use the taxi to take down the guy on the turret.
[10:06.93]Can I, like, zoom in?
[10:07.75]There, he's dead.
[10:10.94]Got him.
[10:12.74]How were we supposed to know we were supposed to do that?
[10:15.28]That's weird.
[10:17.86]Alright, slide into cover.
[10:20.12]Hey, I need to be right back real quick.
[10:22.06]Okay, well, can you fucking just mute your mic and follow me?
[10:26.12]Press Y to slide into cover.
[10:29.27]There we go, got it.
[10:35.03]He's a paid actor.
[10:36.33]This is Etalyx.
[10:37.47]He's actually here.
[10:40.75]Press and hold left bumper and press the D-pad down to select grenades.
[10:45.36]Hold and hold.
[10:45.76]Left trigger to aim.
[10:47.84]And a right trigger.
[10:48.96]What was that?
[10:49.30]It was like a homing grenade.
[10:50.66]I didn't know that.
[10:51.44]Wow.
[10:51.84]Very weird.
[10:56.22]Got it.
[11:03.39]I'm a sad and lonely man.
[11:09.57]I'm playing with one of my friends.
[11:10.73]What are you talking about?
[11:13.37]Like primary weapon.
[11:14.31]Yeah.
[11:17.39]Why is Etalyx streaming?
[11:19.77]What the hell are you talking about?
[11:20.65]Etalyx is currently fucking showing a vodcast.
[11:25.60]He's literally right here.
[11:26.58]Etalyx!
[11:27.86]Are you sitting right next to me right now?
[11:30.82]Alright, well, you're gonna have to fucking, like, listen.
[11:32.58]Like, you're gonna have to prove this shit right now.
[11:34.98]You're sitting- He's naming people in chat right now.
[11:37.45]Like, yeah, that fucking horned owl.
[11:48.39]He's fucking sitting here.
[11:49.59]Right now.
[11:53.55]Base cam- Oh, why are there fucking a thousand people?
[11:55.59]Etalyx, what are you doing?
[11:56.85]What the fuck are you doing?
[12:02.26]What is going on?
[12:03.06]I don't know.
[12:08.02]Why are you doing this?
[12:10.18]Get back here.
[12:11.30]Get back here.
[12:12.02]Yeah, I know.
[12:14.16]I know you're under fire.
[12:16.62]Well, how do I get you to come back?
[12:21.91]This is not a pre-recorded stream.
[12:32.96]Hey, weren't you talking about fucking Army of Two before or something like that?
[12:35.46]Yeah, like you were talking about how you and your buddy, like, we're gonna change that.
[12:38.40]Nice job.
[12:50.33]Hey!
[12:50.55]Don't fucking do that shit!
[12:51.93]Alright, I got it.
[12:52.43]Just shut up.
[13:09.68]You shut the fuck up.
[13:11.40]Shut up.
[13:11.66]You shut up.
[13:12.30]I'll punch you.
[13:12.78]I'll be a funny guy and I'll punch you.
[13:14.00]Where is this guy?
[13:15.42]He's right here.
[13:16.10]It's me.
[13:16.28]Where is this guy?
[13:17.56]I'm standing right next to you.
[13:19.61]Yes.
[13:19.91]No.
[13:20.85]No.
[13:21.99]Here we go.
[13:25.95]Primary weapon.
[13:26.57]Press the right bumper.
[13:27.31]Press D-pad on the right.
[13:29.37]I can trade weapons with you.
[13:30.39]Do you know I can trade weapons with you?
[13:32.41]Yeah.
[13:33.74]Here.
[13:34.94]Yeah, do you want this?
[13:36.26]Do you want this?
[13:37.10]I think it's a... I'm not sure how I feel about that.
[13:39.22]I don't know what it is, but here, you can take it.
[13:40.54]There, swap that.
[13:49.19]Give me yours.
[13:50.25]Hey, can I get a closer look?
[13:52.07]Yeah, there you go.
[13:52.53]Take a look.
[13:55.21]Okay.
[14:17.20]What do you mean, move into the... How many times do I have to shoot a guy in the head for him to die?
[14:21.38]I'm not sure how I feel about that.
[14:22.30]How many times do you have to shoot a guy?
[14:27.31]Select hold position.
[14:29.49]And let's get aggressive.
[14:33.19]Can I get behind this guy and, like, smash him?
[14:36.31]Oh, he can do that to me.
[14:37.37]He just fucking shot me in the head.
[14:38.79]Okay, well, that's easy.
[14:41.81]We did it.
[14:45.46]We did it.
[14:46.01]Oh yeah, nice job.
[14:47.55]Like, I don't know if... Etalyx is not a liar.
[14:55.27]Literally, like, he's in the stream right now.
[14:57.42]And I don't think he... I don't know if he's, like... No, don't... Like, honest to God, like, he's fucking... Like, I don't know why you guys think it's not him.
[15:06.96]It's, like, weird.
[15:07.51]Uh, regroup.
[15:13.06]Get over here, please.
[15:14.96]Please get over here.
[15:17.16]Okay.
[15:24.64]I don't like how I can see your, like, stupid fucking thing over there on the right.
[15:30.91]Turn off the GPS.
[15:32.09]Turn on the GPS.
[15:36.07]This is close to passing the Turing test.
[15:41.31]You can secretly snipe any object which is marked on your GPS.
[15:49.27]Alright, let's do a co-op snipe.
[15:51.31]You want to do a co-op snipe, buddy?
[15:52.99]Yes.
[15:53.19]Are you sure?
[15:53.71]Yes.
[15:54.33]Do you really?
[15:55.42]Are you ready to do a co-op snipe?
[15:56.74]Yes.

[20:10.93]Oh
[20:14.47]Uh, so... Back when Army of Two first came out, me and my college roommates and suitemates were all way too into Halo 3 to really care.
[20:20.71]I didn't even think Army of Two was on my radar in 2008.
[20:24.21]My college suitemates would sneak into my room while I wasn't there and play Halo 3 without my permission on my Xbox.
[20:31.82]But more importantly, they would look at my DVD collection.
[20:35.16]Get up here! Get up here! Get up here! Get up here!
[20:36.42]Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
[20:40.51]and they would play a cruel joke where they would move two random titles in different places and see how long it would take me to notice.
[20:48.04]Help me.
[20:49.04]Help me.
[21:01.26]You know how hard this is?
[21:01.80]What is this guy doing?
[21:02.30]Hey, hey, don't do that!
[21:03.74]Don't you have a fucking story for us?
[21:04.50]Yeah, I know that says a lot more about me than it does about them, but I could tell.
[21:06.54]Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hey, wait, Etalyx, wait, Etalyx, Etalyx!
[21:16.43]Hey, don't you have a story for us?
[21:18.68]Yeah, I know that says a lot more about me than it does about them, but I could tell every time that was the joke.
[21:23.58]I would just scan briefly over my DVDs every day and see if they had taken one.
[21:28.15]It was usually the issue.
[21:30.41]I wasn't checking to see if they put them out of order.
[21:32.37]I was checking because they would turn up missing.
[21:34.85]Oh, well, that's really interesting.
[21:37.16]That's really cool shit.
[21:39.48]That's like, yeah, you're a real fucking, you're a real smooth talker, Talon.
[21:44.57]Shut up.
[21:45.01]You're a real smooth talker.
[21:46.55]Come on, I was just fucking playing with you.
[21:48.11]Come on, man.
[21:50.80]Where are you, by the way?
[21:51.92]Like, where the fuck even are you?
[21:53.42]I'm under fire.
[21:54.70]You are currently walking around in circles.
[21:56.18]That's not true.
[22:03.43]So what happened?
[22:04.55]And then I would track them down and find someone across the hall.
[22:07.17]Oh, okay.
[22:07.75]Yeah, I see.
[22:08.97]What do you know?
[22:10.03]The DVD is missing from inside of its jewel case.
[22:13.37]Where did it go?
[22:14.07]No one knows.
[22:14.62]Oh, I found it.
[22:15.22]It's in two pieces now.
[22:16.72]No, I'm not still angry about that.
[22:17.92]Are you serious?
[22:20.60]Oh, my God.
[22:21.78]Are you serious?
[22:22.56]Are you serious?
[22:23.80]Are you serious?
[22:24.64]Are you serious?
[22:25.56]Yes.
[22:25.90]That's so funny.
[22:33.53]Where am I getting shot at from?
[22:34.51]I don't know how I'm not dead.
[22:46.90]Watch out.
[22:47.56]What happened to you?
[22:48.74]Help me.
[22:50.44]I'm gonna, like, die here.
[22:51.42]I'm literally gonna die.
[22:52.04]I'm gonna die.
[22:52.52]I'm gonna die.
[22:53.00]I'm gonna die.
[22:53.77]I'm gonna die.
[22:54.39]You died again?
[22:55.77]No, I haven't died yet.
[22:56.83]I'm still alive.
[22:57.89]How do you fucking- How do you do the- How do you do it?
[22:59.45]How do you do it?
[23:00.47]How do you do- Do you know how to press the fucking button?
[23:02.11]How do you do- How do you- How do you fucking get cover?
[23:05.10]I didn't know that.
[23:05.90]Wow.
[23:06.72]Do you know how to get cover?
[23:08.12]No.
[23:08.64]Well, then you're fucking useless!

[23:35.50]Why are you fucking walking in circles?
[23:38.00]Get over here.
[23:39.76]Oh, I had to pull you up.

[24:15.55]Right outside here.
[24:17.49]If you take a look out here.
[24:18.46]Yes.

[24:57.34]What are you talking about?
[24:58.54]There's no fucking... You can't have a... No, you're fucking... Now the tutorial is dead.
[25:03.99]You broke the tutorial, Etalyx.
[25:06.01]You broke the fucking tutorial.
[25:06.87]I'm trying to take a game that we play together seriously for once, and all you want to do is stop and make jokes.
[25:15.87]Fuck.
[25:16.81]You died again?
[25:18.29]Help me, help me, help me, help me, help me, help me.

[25:25.29]Come on, what are you doing?
[25:27.33]Get over here.
[25:29.37]There we go.
[25:31.20]Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[25:33.10]You're doing a great job, Vitalik.
[25:34.66]I'm really, really proud of you.
[25:40.32]Nobody accused you of anything.
[25:42.38]Where are you bringing me, by the way?
[25:44.55]Where are you bringing me?
[25:46.15]Where are you bringing me?
[25:49.27]Are you serious?
[25:51.79]Back when Army of Two first came out, me and my college roommates and suitemates were all way too into Halo 3 to really care.
[25:57.61]I didn't even think Army of Two was on my ring.
[26:00.92]Turn it off.
[26:01.86]Turn that off.
[26:02.64]There's no boss battle.
[26:04.10]There is no boss battle right now, Etalyx.
[26:06.20]If you've been paying attention, you'll know that there's no boss battle.
[26:09.64]Not yet.
[26:10.16]That was for a later time.
[26:11.22]That was when I could pay more attention to the screen.
[26:16.67]Get over here.
[26:17.17]After that.
[26:21.80]X-man 427.
[26:22.60]I know I see what you're saying smoke wise ganja.
[26:25.72]Yeah, yeah You guys fucking wanna accuse us of this not being live.
[26:30.20]Of course.
[26:30.70]It's live look chat I don't know what you're thinking right now.
[26:33.62]This is all real.
[26:34.48]This is happening.
[26:35.46]It's a lot.
[26:35.82]Could you not know that?
[26:37.53]You died again.
[26:38.65]You died again.
[26:39.99]Get me up.
[26:40.57]Get me up.
[26:40.99]Get me up.
[26:41.35]Get me up.
[26:41.69]Get me up.

[26:45.33]Hey guys, what's up?
[26:46.23]Hey guys, what's up?
[26:47.41]Where is this guy?
[26:48.99]Where is this guy?
[26:50.55]Hey, I'm heading down over here.
[26:51.81]He's over there.
[26:52.29]He's over on the other side.
[26:53.20]Are you even playing?
[26:54.80]You died again?
[26:55.92]Come on, help me.
[26:56.62]Are you serious?
[26:57.36]Get me over here.
[26:58.58]I'm under fire.
[26:59.24]Okay, let's go.
[27:02.50]You know, the tutorial is very difficult to do.
[27:11.90]I think there's something wrong with my gun.
[27:13.76]Something's wrong with your gun?
[27:15.40]That's the problem?
[27:16.62]It's not everything else?
[27:19.06]Is that the issue that you're having?
[27:20.26]You're having a problem with your gun?
[27:21.42]Yes.
[27:22.92]Oh my god.
[27:28.57]How do we get out of the tutorial?
[27:30.07]Do you know how to get the fuck out of the tutorial?
[27:32.11]Do you know how to get out of the tutorial?
[27:34.45]Get down.
[27:39.53]I didn't know that.
[27:40.17]Wow.
[27:43.43]I didn't know that.
[27:44.21]Wow.
[27:45.97]Oh, here it comes.
[27:48.68]Oh, it's time to fight the boss.
[27:54.74]Etalyx, why are you not happy about that?
[27:56.48]Why are you not concerned about that?
[27:58.12]Whoa, that's pretty... Here comes boss battle, I think.
[28:09.24]This game, man.
[28:10.14]What a bummer.
[28:15.45]Where is this guy?
[28:16.67]I think they're around the corner.
[28:18.23]It's weird.
[28:18.67]I know.
[28:19.65]That's, like, pretty fucking weird.
[28:20.63]No.
[28:21.03]Hey, I need to be right back real quick.
[28:23.13]Yeah, okay.
[28:24.22]You can be right back.
[28:24.78]It's fine.
[28:30.89]Wait a minute, okay.
[28:38.17]Alright.
[28:38.97]Alright, alright.
[28:39.88]Let me fucking explain.
[28:41.46]Let me explain.
[28:43.58]Let me explain.
[28:44.44]Hey guys, what's up?
[28:45.70]Italic, stop talking for a second.
[28:47.22]Italic, stop it.
[28:48.16]No, stop talking.
[28:48.84]Okay, we did it.
[28:49.52]Joke's over.
[28:49.92]That was a pretty fine joke.
[28:51.28]Maybe.
[28:51.40]Maybe.
[28:59.45]Alright, so Army of Two is a co-op game.
[29:03.10]You play it with two people.
[29:04.18]It's designed to play the whole fucking game with two people.
[29:08.18]Unbeknownst to me and Etalyx, they shut down the fucking servers for this game.
[29:12.48]You cannot play this game online.
[29:16.72]And we didn't know that, and I got the game, and I still wanted to fucking play it with a partner, with Etalyx.
[29:24.82]So we did.
[29:25.98]And he's here.
[29:29.10]This stream is just fucking pre-recorded.
[29:30.62]There's your pre-recorded Etalyx.
[29:33.92]And I honestly... It has been fucking hard to keep that up and like look over at my other monitor and play this game at the same time.
[29:41.11]What I meant to say was, I'm just kidding.
[29:42.41]Italic has been here forever.
[29:46.33]So I figured it would be funny.
[29:49.05]You guys got rused.
[29:51.13]Welcome to your Tuesday stream.
[29:53.57]I pretend to have robot Etalyx for like an hour and then I fucking stop streaming.
[30:00.20]No, we're gonna play this game.
[30:01.68]I'm gonna play this game.
[30:03.14]Yes.
[30:04.08]Yes, I am.
[30:04.64]And Etalyx will pop up, like, from time to time.
[30:08.20]Tuesday for Rue's Day.
[30:09.32]I can approach the vehicle?
[30:14.86]What can I do?
[30:18.82]So, Etalyx ain't going anywhere.
[30:20.02]Etalyx is, like, still gonna stick around.
[30:23.72]As you can see there.
[30:26.46]Where's the real Etalyx?
[30:27.28]The real Etalyx is streaming right now.
[30:33.00]Wait, approach the vehicle, boy.
[30:34.21]I hope this is all the way back here.
[30:35.37]Hold on.
[30:39.45]There it is.
[30:39.89]It's over there.
[30:45.13]You wouldn't believe how, like, annoying... There's, like... How many Etalyx responses do I have?
[30:49.36]Let's see.
[30:49.74]I have, like, 41... I have, like, 35 to 45 Etalyx responses.
[31:13.18]Dude, once he started telling the story for like the third time.
[31:18.95]I was confused for a couple minutes.
[31:21.37]Get this off.
[31:21.89]I don't even want this.
[31:25.21]Where the fuck am I even supposed to go right now?
[31:26.59]Through here?
[31:26.95]I guess.
[31:31.19]Don't tell me I need the shield for this.
[31:32.37]Do you think we need the shield for this?
[31:34.58]Okay.
[31:35.52]No.
[31:36.12]Then that means no.
[31:36.62]You guys know I'm going to use robot Etalyx to do this.
[31:45.72]Oh, it's time to fight the boss.
[31:47.12]Yep, here it comes.
[31:47.74]You think you own the whole world, that you can go wherever you please.
[31:52.51]Do what you want.
[31:53.43]But this is not your country.
[31:55.95]This is our country.
[31:57.59]And this is our country.
[31:58.63]Come to boss battle.
[32:03.34]Play Garfield.
[32:04.56]Back to back.
[32:06.58]I think we're going to lose.
[32:15.86]I'm like, why can't you shoot this guy, Etalyx?
[32:19.40]Where's the boss?
[32:21.42]Where the fuck is the boss?
[32:23.64]I didn't know that.
[32:26.10]No, you didn't know about that because you weren't paying attention.
[32:30.39]Now play with Garfield?
[32:31.41]Fine.
[32:32.35]Fine, I'm gonna play with Garfield now.
[32:41.81]This is important to me.
[32:43.45]I need to take a second.
[32:44.25]I'm gonna play with Garfield now.
[32:45.27]Fine.
[32:48.86]Uh, Garfield and Friends Nightmare.

[34:27.91]Well, this game really does require... You can't play this game alone.
[34:32.16]No way.
[34:33.06]It's not a game to play by yourself.
[34:37.84]Why can I not hear it?
[34:46.70]People gave like bits too.
[34:48.12]That was like a 32 minute joke.
[34:50.36]Give me a minute before we keep going here.
[34:57.69]Nice job, Vitalik.
[34:58.39]You did a good job.

[35:09.66]Okay, well, we need to do a 1-2-3 shoot.
[35:14.84]I've got to re-plug in my headphones here.
[35:17.48]Because I can't hear anything.

[35:37.41]What the fuck is this?
[35:40.95]This is not actually a Jerma soundboard, is there?
[35:46.00]This is like four things.
[35:48.52]This is like three or four quotes that I've had over the last like five years.
[35:52.81]This is not like a soundboard.
[35:56.02]I'm not gonna use the Jerma soundboard.

[36:55.31]Honest to God, that took... You wanna know why I was late today?
[36:58.05]Uh, because that took, like, fucking an extra, like, 40 minutes to set up.
[37:04.65]Maybe longer.
[37:09.19]I still don't know how to fucking duck.
[37:11.35]That's not duck.
[37:15.93]Oh, that's...

[37:42.10]Can't wait for this.
[37:43.90]But I'm still hungry.
[37:45.35]Oh, are you, Garfield?
[37:46.49]Are you hungry, Garfield?
[37:48.75]That's interesting.
[37:50.95]This is laid out so terribly, by the way.
[37:55.13]And that's it.
[37:56.05]That's all.
[37:56.43]That's the only one I could play.
[37:57.95]I've got like four adds.
[38:02.67]I can't even play these.
[38:05.55]Oh, good.
[38:06.07]Okay.
[38:06.97]Okay, Garfield.
[38:07.69]You got it.
[38:11.25]Yeah, sure.
[38:13.98]That was not Garfield.
[38:14.84]That was somebody else.
[38:15.40]That was a different character.
[38:16.28]That was not fucking Garfield.
[38:18.41]Give me my other gun.
[38:21.98]What was that stupid little somersault?
[38:31.12]I knew this would happen.
[38:32.74]He's just getting larger and larger.
[38:36.96]You died again?
[38:38.16]You died again?
[38:43.02]That's why it says friends?
[38:44.37]No.
[38:48.89]I need a Garfield says, like, yes and no soundboard.
[38:59.46]I got you covered over here.
[39:00.38]Yeah, you can.
[39:00.84]Take a look.
[39:01.18]Yes.
[39:01.32]No.
[39:01.40]Yes.
[39:01.56]Yes.
[39:08.42]But, yeah, it took... It took, like, some work to get Etalyx.
[39:12.88]Etalyx, like... I asked Etalyx.
[39:15.48]I'm like, hey, yeah, can you, like, record yourself?
[39:20.42]He was, like, about to stream, and he spent, like, 45 minutes, like, recording dialog for me.
[39:24.86]Like, give it up for Etalyx.
[39:29.02]Is there a grenade?
[39:33.38]So, now that I got you guys here, let's start... Did he go down?
[39:36.91]I should probably plug this back in.
[39:39.85]No, I'm not doing, like, a Donald Trump.
[39:41.37]I'm not, like, playing with Donald Trump.
[39:43.11]Like, isn't there, like, a fucking YouTuber that does that anyways?
[39:46.23]Like, take a look at me.
[39:46.92]I'm playing with, like, Morgan Freeman.
[39:50.84]I'm playing with, like, Captain Kirk.
[39:53.16]Somebody does that, don't they?
[39:54.02]There we go.
[39:58.22]We're good.
[39:59.84]Clyde to Richard Dalton.
[40:01.38]I've completed the mission.
[40:02.41]Transfer the second half of my fee into my...
[40:06.22]Anyways, during that whole thing.
[40:08.98]Edgemont, thank you for the $10.
[40:09.84]It says, best joke.
[40:11.90]Well, thank you.
[40:13.26]Gummy Monk, thanks for the $15.
[40:16.99]Jesus.
[40:17.83]Thanks for the $15, Gummy Monk.
[40:19.15]If you don't give us this soundboard, I'm going to cry.
[40:21.37]I had to make it myself, so it doesn't exist online.
[40:24.05]I have a soundboard program.
[40:27.10]Ilvery, thanks for the bits.
[40:28.14]Axeman, Wet Cane, Mr. Tubbs, Apples Are Good, Sputnik,
[40:34.45]Thank you for the bits.
[40:35.01]Cigarette Spaghetti, thanks for the $10.
[40:38.37]A thousand bits for Etalyx to say my name.
[40:46.66]But anyways, thank you guys.
[40:47.58]Also, thank you to BadaBangPalks for the $5.
[40:50.82]Perfect way to end a birthday with a Jerma stream.
[40:53.86]I also looked up the height of Jesus and he was around 5'1".
[40:57.16]So, thank you for the $5.
[40:59.38]And Bacon, Boneless Bacon, thanks for the $4.
[41:01.64]$5 five days ago, whatever.
[41:04.51]Am I going to play this all day?
[41:05.64]No, guys, that's all I got.
[41:07.06]That was the only thing I had.
[41:09.06]I'll tell you a story while we play this painfully generic video game.
[41:15.08]So, I bought a SEGA CD.
[41:18.29]I went to a boutique store.
[41:20.81]I bought a SEGA CD and I bought 15 SEGA CD games.
[41:25.47]So we're going to have like a SEGA CD nightmare week where we play a ton of SEGA CD games.
[41:34.19]Some of the old fucking classics, some ones you may not have heard of.
[41:39.87]They're going to work.
[41:41.73]I have a way to make it work.
[41:42.93]Don't worry.
[41:44.99]Etalyx is currently walking in a circle.
[41:49.71]I was going to talk shit right there.
[41:57.47]But yes, that is a plan.
[41:59.55]That's the plan.
[42:00.19]The only reason why... The reason why I can't do that now is because I'm waiting for a converter to come in from Amazon, so... Couldn't do it today.
[42:11.18]Also, also, another Jerma wrestling event is going to happen on stream.
[42:17.80]That was also going to possibly be tonight, but it's not, obviously.
[42:22.34]So, see this stream as, like, an in-between stream.
[42:24.82]Because I'm, like, working on a bunch of interesting things for this week and next week.
[42:28.20]So, I wanted to do something interesting tonight, though, if I could.
[42:32.60]So, there's going to be another, like, live Jerma Rumble, Jerma Wrestling card.
[42:36.68]Probably next... I don't want to give you time.
[42:42.66]Within the next week, you're going to see another Jerma Rumble.
[42:45.12]Like, on stream.
[42:45.82]With a bunch of new characters from the last, like, 6 to 12 months of streaming.
[42:49.42]And, you know, you get the idea.
[42:52.54]This was just a joke that I had to make because we couldn't play it together, and me and Italic were sad.
[42:57.90]So, who the fuck is shooting at?
[43:04.97]Can I please shoot this guy?
[43:06.25]That's what I love-
[43:17.61]Etalyx is gonna be a character there's gonna be a lot of characters because remember we have all the characters from last time and more to add so there's gonna be a lot there there's gonna be like 65 characters to work with okay so we'll see what the hell are you two waiting for get up there and help me hold this place down why don't you give the other one a boost up there
[43:43.31]Random in-between stream has 45 minutes of prep time.
[43:46.33]Well, I want... Look, if I'm working on a bunch of material, right?
[43:52.91]I still want to do something fun.
[43:57.20]Once I start to become comfortable... This is something you need to know about me.
[44:00.84]Once I start to become comfortable is when I stop making things I want to make.
[44:06.32]I always have to be in a constant state of uncomfortableness.
[44:09.40]I have to be changing my mind all the time.
[44:12.73]Otherwise I can't do anything.
[44:22.00]Robo Etalyx.
[44:27.92]No, there will not be seven serpents.
[44:30.69]Not this time.
[44:34.08]This game is fucking pretty dumb.
[44:36.82]I can see how this game could have been fun with, like, another person.
[44:39.94]If, like, Etalyx was actually here, if Etalyx was actually sitting here, this, like, would have been fun.
[44:46.66]Because, like, we could have done, like, karate chops to people and, like, punched them in the face and, like, have the Jerma suplex themselves in the neck.
[44:59.77]Can you drive cars?
[45:00.71]No.
[45:02.74]Is it going to be Karazin?
[45:06.25]I can see how this could be fun, sitting around with a couple of friends.
[45:09.17]Just shooting things.
[45:14.12]Uh, Jerma Rumble Live or Jerma Rumble Live Action?
[45:16.08]Jerma Rumble Live.
[45:19.06]I cannot talk about Jerma Rumble Live Action.
[45:23.47]I can't.
[45:25.03]That's all you need to know.
[45:27.37]I cannot talk about it.
[45:30.23]I sure would love to!
[45:32.33]Can't talk about it.
[45:33.99]Maybe some other time.
[45:37.06]What the fuck are we doing?
[45:39.72]There's a lot of things I want to talk about.
[45:41.30]There is.
[45:49.55]Nothing to do with, like, an NDA.
[45:51.73]No.
[45:51.89]Alright, uh, should I... Should I just go back to Undead Nightmare and, like, play that for another hour or two?
[46:00.06]I feel like this joke ran its course, like, fucking 20 minutes ago.
[46:06.87]I could finish Undead Nightmare.
[46:08.84]Or at least I could play a little bit more of it.
[46:11.62]Anything that fits.
[46:14.80]Alright, let me do one more, like, one more, like, Etalyx joke.
[46:19.94]Alright, everybody close your ears.
[46:24.12]This is gonna get, this is gonna get fucking wild in a second.
[46:26.66]You ready?
[46:27.02]This is gonna get wild.
[46:29.86]It might be loud.
[46:32.81]He's telling the Xbox story twice.
[46:47.83]Alright, okay, okay, alright, alright, alright.
[46:51.26]Etalyx, thank you for joining us.
[46:55.00]Thank you for doing this, by the way.
[46:58.02]You are a trooper, for sure.
[47:01.32]Yes, you are.
[47:02.64]So, everyone say goodbye to Etalyx.
[47:05.69]Say bye, Etalyx.
[47:07.61]Wave goodbye.
[47:09.01]See you later, Etalyx.
[47:09.85]Thank you for playing.
[47:11.97]It was too quiet?
[47:12.67]I didn't want to make that fucking that loud.
[47:14.13]That would blow out everybody's eardrums.
[47:16.50]Okay.
[47:18.28]Take Etalyx with you into Undead Nightmare.
[47:21.28]No.
[47:25.09]Red Dead Redemption, Undead Nightmare, and single player.
[47:29.33]Let's get back into this.
[47:33.71]What?
[47:38.62]What are you talking about?
[47:40.46]You're going to do this again?
[47:53.59]No, no, Xbox.
[47:54.71]I don't own the game.
[47:55.91]I just played Red Dead Redemption for like 24 hours.
[47:59.13]Or like 22 hours.
[48:01.23]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[48:04.41]Wait a minute.
[48:04.91]Okay, this is, I get it.
[48:06.78]Don't, don't worry.
[48:09.06]There is a disk.
[48:10.02]I'm just fucking about to, I was freaking out for no reason.
[48:14.00]Let's get back into Undead Nightmare.
[48:15.38]Here it is.
[48:15.76]Here's the disk.
[48:17.20]Wait, what's in here?
[48:19.14]What is this?
[48:20.74]Oh, Army of Two.
[48:21.69]Whoa.
[48:24.01]Oh, I read it too, huh?
[48:26.07]Interesting.
[48:27.99]Oh, give me one.
[48:29.48]My fucking webcam's not plugged in.
[48:31.02]God damn it.
[48:34.66]Just pretend I was here.
[48:36.26]Pretend like it... Show them.
[49:07.44]I gotta be real careful because I'm in my fucking underwear.
[49:10.20]Anyway, I ain't getting banned from Twitch.
[49:12.08]So, like, this is gonna be an upper body joke only.
[49:16.16]This is an upper body joke only.
[49:19.60]So let me make sure this is in the right fucking spot before I do this.
[49:23.13]There's no pants in here?
[49:24.45]Fuck.
[49:24.87]Okay.
[49:25.53]Hold on.
[49:25.83]This is gonna be fucking risky.
[49:27.91]Risky!
[49:37.49]Where is it?
[49:40.35]Where is it?
[49:44.28]Where is it?
[49:44.64]Come on!
[49:47.66]Where's my Logitech?
[49:50.78]The fuck?
[49:56.55]What the fuck?
[49:59.55]Oh shit, OBS is cr- NO!
[50:05.46]Can you guys hear me?
[50:06.48]I can see chat right now.
[50:07.48]Can you guys hear me?
[50:08.06]My fucking OBS is crashing.
[50:09.66]Because I just tried to turn my webcam on.
[50:11.98]You guys can still hear me, right?
[50:20.92]I can't touch OBS.
[50:23.26]It's not responding.
[50:28.42]Can you see me moving around?
[50:33.42]Why the fuck?
[50:35.82]Not responding.
[50:36.48]What the fuck are you talking about?
[50:38.54]Shit.
[50:39.16]Okay.
[50:40.80]I got to close Etalyx webcam.
[50:45.81]Close Etalyx.
[50:46.45]Maybe that'll help.
[50:49.23]Somebody just gave a hundred fucking dollars.
[50:50.51]Hold on a second.
[50:51.05]Like my OBS is going to be in a constant state of crashing.
[50:55.23]Hopefully you guys can hear the fucking game.
[51:01.52]What the fuck?
[51:02.28]I was gonna make a stupid fucking joke and now like I can't even... Well, I have the constant wheel of death on OBS.
[51:15.18]Okay.
[51:16.30]At least if you guys tell me that you can still see this.
[51:24.21]What a bummer.
[51:27.13]Yeah, if I hit the X on OBS, the stream ends.
[51:35.58]Hopefully it's not too soft, because I can't change anything.
[51:40.96]Restart the stream?
[51:41.88]I mean, it's... Don't you guys know how Twitch works?
[51:46.12]Like, if my stream turns off, like 700 people are just going to leave.
[51:50.38]That's how this works.
[51:52.10]You guys are like, no, I'm here, so I'm here.
[51:53.72]If I turn the stream off, all of you are going to leave.
[51:58.66]That's how it works.
[52:07.50]I'm going to turn it off for five seconds.
[52:09.73]Here we go.
[52:10.05]Ready?
[52:11.19]Don't go anywhere.
[52:12.61]How many people are here?
[52:16.20]There are fucking like 1,900 people here.
[52:18.22]There better be 1,900 people here when I come back.
[52:21.28]Here we go.
[52:21.66]I'm leaving.
