[ve:60.16.100]

[00:30.87]Yeah, actually early.
[00:32.61]How's it going?
[00:38.74]I mean, I'm here and I'm ready to talk.
[00:42.04]This room is going to be like maybe.
[00:46.84]25 minutes total.
[00:56.29]Not going to be a long one tonight.
[00:57.37]Gonna be short.
[00:59.79]Title lied.
[01:01.29]Oh, it does say 40 minutes.
[01:02.99]Well, I wanted to give myself up to 40 minutes.
[01:05.93]Just in case it went a little longer.
[01:07.07]Do you have a comb?
[01:13.98]No, there is no combing tonight.
[01:18.74]Something I didn't do for five days.
[01:20.72]When was the last time I streamed?
[01:21.43]Like five days ago?
[01:22.11]Six days ago?
[01:22.61]I don't remember.
[01:24.39]In at least six or seven days.
[01:30.66]It was like 12 years ago.
[01:31.66]Six days, yeah.
[01:35.64]So the last time I was live, I... I didn't talk about the House Flipper stream.
[01:41.92]We were still kind of solidifying and confirming a lot of things, but I didn't even bring it up.
[01:47.28]I was like, yeah, it's, uh... Whenever it's gonna happen, it's tomorrow.
[01:52.72]It's literally tomorrow.
[01:56.80]I've been just so busy that I just like, wait a minute.
[02:01.42]It's tomorrow.
[02:04.32]Busy planning this, by the way.
[02:05.54]That's one of those other things.
[02:07.30]You know, I'm doing all kinds of stuff.
[02:10.69]But this is exciting.
[02:14.07]So give me two seconds.
[02:14.89]I'm going to grab my drink.
[02:17.33]And I'm going to give you a presentation.
[02:20.66]Get ready to be bored.
[02:22.26]Be right back.
[02:54.30]Somebody said, you're such a Virgo.
[02:57.54]Is it showing?
[03:00.92]What does that mean?
[03:01.40]Alright, you guys ready?
[03:06.34]Okay, so really important stuff.
[03:13.79]Hi, everybody.
[03:15.31]Welcome to the pre-House Flipper 2 Invitational.
[03:21.14]rules, regulations, and team composition stream.
[03:27.88]That's what we're doing tonight.
[03:30.20]Because there's a lot.
[03:33.06]I don't want to say I went overboard with this event, but I kind of went overboard with this event.
[03:37.08]And you'll see very soon why.
[03:39.76]It is tomorrow.
[03:41.48]The House Flipper 2 Invitational is tomorrow, which is the launch day for the game, too.
[03:47.71]Game comes out tomorrow.
[03:52.85]tomorrow.
[03:54.09]Alright, you guys ready?
[03:55.63]Here we go.
[03:58.73]There are 18 streamers in this tomorrow.
[04:02.79]This is the most amount of people I've ever spoken to in like a one or two week setting.
[04:10.31]There are three builds this time, not just one.
[04:12.91]There's going to be Yeah, so one, two and three teams.
[04:21.38]We're not doing 18 houses.
[04:22.94]That's not going to work.
[04:25.16]18 single houses would have been like a 14 hour stream.
[04:28.82]That's not going to happen.
[04:33.84]This is going to be so scuffed.
[04:36.65]And I think this is going to be a lot of fun.
[04:39.09]I am so looking forward to this.
[04:41.03]I'm very excited for this.
[04:43.99]So, the first build is going to be the first player, player A, is going to build a 20-minute house.
[04:52.71]You don't know what that is either.
[04:53.65]I do.
[04:55.37]Secret themes on the first two builds, both 20 minutes, leading us to the 90-minute one at the end.
[05:03.36]Did you coordinate this with the House Flipper guys?
[05:05.26]I did.
[05:06.88]So, this is an officially endorsed event.
[05:11.54]This event is not sponsored.
[05:13.65]But for total transparency, this is a cool announcement too.
[05:17.79]I will be sponsored to play it for the whole weekend.
[05:22.15]You're going to get five streams in a row.
[05:25.59]So today, tomorrow, and then all weekend.
[05:30.71]Actually, Omega Gaming weekend.
[05:34.18]So that's really cool.
[05:35.72]That as of this weekend, I'll be sponsored to play one of my favorite franchises.
[05:41.36]I genuinely believe that.
[05:42.50]I love this game and I love this franchise.
[05:44.04]So that's really cool.
[05:46.16]So thanks to the House Flipper devs for really kind of stepping up and letting us get access to the game a little early.
[05:53.71]Otherwise, this would have been pretty much impossible to do on launch.
[05:56.57]It would have been completely impossible, honestly.
[05:58.07]Alright.
[06:00.71]So here is your format.
[06:02.73]But...
[06:04.13]I'm trying to shave as much time off of tomorrow as possible.
[06:08.67]So I'm doing this stream right now so we don't have to do this in the intro tomorrow.
[06:14.96]So that's it.
[06:19.51]I want to try to keep this thing under five hours, not eight.
[06:23.21]Because one of the things last time was, and I know, trust me, I know.
[06:29.21]If you were one of the last people to build last time, you sat around for like two and a half hours.
[06:34.07]I don't want that to happen this time.
[06:38.27]He's going to recap it all tomorrow anyways.
[06:40.21]No, no, this is for you guys.
[06:42.53]All the players know what's going on.
[06:44.89]I just want to make sure you guys know what's going on.
[06:48.44]Is the whole thing pre-recorded?
[06:49.63]No, no, no, no.
[06:54.09]There is no multiplayer.
[06:57.22]So one of the hard things with this event was I wanted more people this time because a lot of people were interested.
[07:03.38]And I had a lot of random invites out that people couldn't do it last time and who like gels together in this one and trying to find the people to do it.
[07:13.40]I didn't want to just do like eight or nine people.
[07:15.15]I wanted like 10 plus people.
[07:16.63]I wanted like 20 people this time, which is crazy, but whatever.
[07:20.45]Did you smoke a pack of cigarettes?
[07:21.69]Ban that guy for an hour.
[07:24.53]But we'll talk a little bit more, but hold on.
[07:25.83]Here we go.
[07:27.04]Let's go over the teams.
[07:28.30]Because again, everybody's going to have a teammate.
[07:31.16]And the first player builds the first house.
[07:33.86]Second player builds the second house.
[07:36.56]And they're going to give individual tours.
[07:38.86]They will come together to make the final house together.
[07:45.94]Why would you go live early?
[07:46.96]Because I got shit to do.
[07:53.88]Will they also be streaming it?
[07:55.40]There's no obligation for anybody to stream it, but I mean, it's obviously encouraged if you want to.
[08:05.41]Are we going to get to know who's going to be there?
[08:09.08]Yeah, because there's your first team.
[08:12.80]This is team one, and this is also the order they're going to be presenting.
[08:18.44]Team number one, presenting first.
[08:22.52]Will be C-Dawg.
[08:24.58]And Connor Reads Pants.
[08:25.52]That's Team Connor.
[08:28.98]Followed by Team 2.
[08:31.25]I didn't put the fucking music on.
[08:35.81]There we go.
[08:38.25]I need to have like chill beats.
[08:39.59]Otherwise I'm going to be all fucked up.
[08:43.65]Okay.
[08:44.63]Team 2.
[08:47.11]Dug Dug and Ludwig.
[08:51.09]That is the order they're presenting as well.
[08:55.21]Oh my God, look at all these pog.
[08:56.55]Look at all these pog faces.
[08:58.95]That's a stack team.
[09:02.31]I don't know.
[09:02.81]There's a lot of good.
[09:04.01]There are nine teams.
[09:05.07]There's a lot of great teams here.
[09:06.21]This is such a scuffed team announcement.
[09:10.40]Why?
[09:10.76]What do you want me to do?
[09:12.64]What would you rather?
[09:21.05]Alright, Team 3.
[09:23.21]Coming in in third.
[09:25.45]RT Game and Kiwo.
[09:29.48]RT won it last time.
[09:32.14]This is a... This might be a powerful group.
[09:36.24]This one might be too powerful.
[09:38.44]But, we'll see.
[09:43.84]Team 3 hype.
[09:46.86]All three of these so far have been pretty hype.
[09:50.46]Yeah, RT won it last time, so see what he does this time.
[09:55.26]Four.
[09:56.84]Vinny and Joel.
[10:02.17]They were pretty high up.
[10:03.25]This might be a really good team, too.
[10:06.81]They both had, what, like B pluses?
[10:09.82]A minuses or something?
[10:12.12]That's pretty high.
[10:18.54]Oh, that's our boys.
[10:22.18]How did you get these people to agree?
[10:24.24]I don't know.
[10:25.91]I just said, hey, do you want to do a House Flipper show?
[10:31.25]It wasn't like an interrogation.
[10:36.57]Like, hey, where are you going to be on the 14th?
[10:41.53]Yeah.
[10:41.73]You're going to be here, actually.
[10:48.14]Team number five.
[10:52.02]Slow reveal.
[10:53.22]Come on, milk it.
[10:54.70]If it shows tomorrow, milk it.
[10:59.98]Northernlion and Squeaks.
[11:03.77]That's a tough one too.
[11:09.73]Yeah.
[11:17.42]Somebody said, holy shit.
[11:27.20]This is a popular one.
[11:28.56]Uh-oh.
[11:29.64]Have we found one of the most popular group?
[11:34.23]Is it these two?
[11:34.95]Hmm.
[11:40.20]House Flipping in real life?
[11:41.98]No, it is for the launch of the highly anticipated game House Flipper 2 on Steam.
[11:49.91]My voice is so fucked up today.
[11:51.27]I've been talking way too much.
[11:56.11]Are you ready?
[11:56.41]Team number six.
[12:08.16]Esfand and Bonnie.
[12:12.03]That's going to be a good one too.
[12:13.07]Oh, lots of, lots of pogs.
[12:42.22]Where's Criken?
[12:44.34]Hold on.
[12:44.94]There's still three more teams.
[12:51.66]Yeah, it's going to be cool to... Actually, I think this is the first time that... I mean, really playing a game with Ezfand, technically.
[13:00.45]We've done some other things, but... I don't think we've been on stream really together.
[13:04.13]So that's going to be fun.
[13:06.49]Maybe once or twice.
[13:10.23]Alright, team number seven.
[13:13.50]You know, you know what's coming.
[13:16.60]We got poke and Ster.
[13:23.57]I am completely anticipating this to be a Ster.
[13:29.19]I don't know.
[13:29.47]I don't want to say anything.
[13:32.03]Because this is potentially a like giga powered team.
[13:44.60]qualified for the win no nope everybody here is is is awesome but I don't know I feel like the two of these it's like what was the Dragon Ball characters when they put their fingers together and they turn into another carrot what is it I'm afraid of that we already have judge bias no no I'm just saying like this is look at one through seven and look at these powerful teams
[14:15.53]Are they going to need it?
[14:17.15]Team number eight.
[14:18.99]Still going against Wilnef and Snuffy.
[14:22.97]Well, everyone's going against each other, but Wilnef and Snuffy.
[14:31.02]Again, really, really looking forward to see what this group does.
[14:43.50]That's a lot of people.
[14:44.84]Yeah, it is.
[14:45.56]I love how somebody said, dude, no, I'm not, whatever.
[14:57.00]Alright.
[14:58.84]And the last team that you will see here tonight for the reveals.
[15:05.17]You already know.
[15:05.95]Come on.
[15:07.03]It's the Talics and Criken.
[15:11.02]Etalyx and Criken Etalyx almost won it last time.
[15:17.38]One of the rules that when I was making these teams was RT and Etalyx could not be together.
[15:24.03]And DougDoug and RT could not be together.
[15:26.51]DougDoug and Etalyx could not be together.
[15:33.03]Is this going to be live?
[15:33.73]It'll be live tomorrow.
[15:35.71]Tomorrow at 1 p.m.
[15:37.29]Pacific.
[15:41.60]There you go.
[15:42.94]Seadog, Conrad's Pants, DougDoug, Ludwig, RTGame, Kiwo, Vinny, Joel, NorthernLion, Squeaks, Ezfan, Bonnie, Poke, Ster, Wilnef, Stuffy, Etalyx, Criken.
[15:51.37]This is every single person I've ever spoken to that's in the stream room.
[15:55.69]That's a lie.
[15:58.43]Honestly, it's like kind of close.
[16:01.64]There's maybe like six people not on this list that I have ever talked to.
[16:08.48]I know it's a lie.
[16:09.42]It's just for fun.
[16:13.65]There's people that I would want to invite.
[16:15.23]There's a lot of people that I, you know, I mentioned this event to, but one thing that became pretty clear is once it was, once there was like 14, 15, 16, 18 people, I was like, okay, I got to wrap it up because this is going to be like a 10 hour stream if I'm not careful.
[16:37.68]Yeah, again, this is the order that they're going to be presenting.
[16:39.86]And again, let me try to break this down a little bit more.
[16:43.00]So,
[16:45.14]Let's go over this.
[16:46.42]Because again, this is for you guys, because this is going to be kind of a lot.
[16:50.86]So for instance, C-Dawg is player A. Well, they can decide this, but let's just say C-Dawg is player A. So if C-Dawg is player A, C-Dawg is going to build for 20 minutes a predetermined build going on a theme that I give him.
[17:12.83]all the player a's let's say that's let's say it's all the people on the left side all these people on the left are going to build the first house the second player is going to be in a call with them it's the first player's house but they can obviously give feedback and you know oh I don't know if I like that paint color I don't know if I like that well maybe you should move that but remember it's the first person's house
[17:39.54]This second build is for the second player.
[17:41.79]So for instance, Con Reed's Pants would do the second build, not Sea Dog.
[17:44.61]It's going to be cooperative backseating.
[17:48.28]Oh yeah.
[17:50.86]20 minutes is too short.
[17:53.65]20 minutes is too long because the entire event is going to be in a new game mode that House Flipper has put in, and it's sandbox mode.
[18:05.49]Sandbox mode is un-fucking-believable.
[18:10.27]You can do anything.
[18:11.65]Instantly.
[18:13.67]Every wall goes up instantly.
[18:16.03]No more paint cans.
[18:17.65]If you want to paint an entire 100-foot wall, you can do it in a tenth of a second.
[18:22.10]Every single thing is unlocked.
[18:24.80]Every single thing is there.
[18:29.58]It's kind of wild.
[18:32.69]So, all the time that everybody was spending on cleaning, there's no cleaning in this one either.
[18:39.75]All the time people spent cleaning, putting up walls, taking down walls.
[18:44.55]It's essentially like a Minecraft creative mode.
[18:46.78]There's an undo button.
[18:50.04]You can literally just delete everything and or redo.
[18:54.98]So all the time, I think if you go back and watch all the different perspectives from last time, it really does feel like 20 to 30 minutes of that hour and 15 was just spent cleaning the house.
[19:05.33]So 90 minutes is effectively them getting an extra 40 minutes to actually build the house and all the design tools that are in the sandbox mode.
[19:15.94]It might be too long, but in testing, it seems like these are good periods to stop.
[19:30.01]Cleaning was funny when you were viewing them though.
[19:32.17]It was, but what would I like to give everybody like four hours to build a house?
[19:40.31]Absolutely.
[19:41.77]But they would have to be like three people in the event.
[19:45.92]You know what I mean?
[19:46.46]Like, I wanted there to be more people in this one.
[19:51.18]And I wanted the teams, because I think teams is fun.
[19:53.01]Because then you get the back and forth of like, alright.
[19:55.89]Like, for instance, what does Poke want to do that Ster doesn't?
[20:02.03]And they got to kind of come to an agreement.
[20:03.90]Because in House Flipper 2...
[20:06.70]is a pretty they have a lot of really good tools in this game like for instance you're probably wondering what do you mean both players if it's not multiplayer you can share house files to each other seamlessly it's so easy so at the 45 minute mark we're gonna swap the builder it's gonna take about 10 seconds
[20:32.51]So at that 90 minutes, the build three, at 45 minutes, they have to switch builders.
[20:43.76]Will you give content?
[20:44.42]What was this question we say?
[20:46.33]Will you give contestants a moment to get familiar with the game's controls?
[20:50.15]Hey, take a look at that last line.
[20:52.87]House Flipper has given us access to the game early because the event is a launch day event.
[21:01.79]If they didn't, I don't think we'd be able to do this right now.
[21:09.50]The actual event is not sponsored.
[21:14.25]And I think there was a lot of theories out there.
[21:18.03]It's like, okay, should there be a sponsor on this event?
[21:22.07]But it came down to this.
[21:23.43]There's almost 20 people.
[21:25.78]And trying to find the right way to do a sponsored event just kind of wasn't going to happen with 18 people.
[21:35.99]And I would much rather the event not have to have very many constraints on it.
[21:42.15]Because with sponsorships and getting stuff paid for, all of a sudden you start to go down another road.
[21:47.80]I would much rather just do the event that... I mean, we were going to do this.
[21:51.44]This event was going to happen anyways.
[21:53.14]This event was happening anyways.
[21:55.54]It's just the House Flipper devs knew that we were doing it again and said, hey, can we like support it?
[22:02.15]Can we like give you guys access to the game?
[22:04.37]Because it's a lot of tools, a lot of shit to need to know.
[22:08.81]And everybody's been kind of playing around with it the last day or two.
[22:11.99]So people people should be at least familiar enough to make something interesting.
[22:22.88]Who are the judges and what are the judging criteria?
[22:26.16]Got that for you too.
[22:28.28]It's just not up there.
[22:29.84]Let me get it to you.
[22:32.14]So yeah, so the build one and two are not going to be creativity, philosophy, cleanliness, structural integrity.
[22:41.77]No, the first two builds really are to just kind of warm up, get people familiar, get people talking, having fun.
[22:49.30]I am going to give a single grade for Build 1 and 2.
[22:53.63]It's one single grade from me, and one single grade from you.
[22:58.81]My grade is worth 75% of the total grade for that portion.
[23:03.81]Yours is worth 25%.
[23:09.72]On the third build, it is Creativity, Philosophy, Structural Integrity, and Chats Grade.
[23:19.65]Creativity, 35%.
[23:21.93]Philosophy, 25%.
[23:24.09]Structural integrity, 25%.
[23:25.15]And your grade is 15.
[23:30.06]Yeah, you better believe philosophy was coming back.
[23:32.84]Come on.
[23:35.84]You could be in a fursuit right now and none of us would know.
[23:38.44]Yeah, we could.
[23:44.43]Our grade should be worth 50%.
[23:47.65]no no no that's I'm sorry your grade's not gonna be worth 50 weight on the whole thing but speaking of weight build one is worth 15 of the team's total grade build two is worth 15 of the team's total grade and build three is worth 70 of the team's total grade I love doing this math it's fun
[24:17.60]End of the year streamer finals.
[24:22.60]I can't believe there's 18 fucking people.
[24:24.34]Well, we'll see, right?
[24:25.38]Like, hopefully all 18 people are there.
[24:27.31]I think everyone's over here.
[24:29.83]Everyone's in the Discord.
[24:30.95]Everyone's ready to go, it seems like.
[24:34.15]But we'll figure it out.
[24:35.81]This whole thing, again, is for fun.
[24:37.01]It's not... Who's, like, the best?
[24:39.69]No, who gives a shit?
[24:40.71]It's all just to get people together.
[24:42.07]Have a good time.
[24:42.81]Mess around.
[24:43.43]That's all it is.
[24:45.82]And then this weekend, later this weekend, I'll be live playing it sponsored.
[24:52.66]It was just a no-brainer.
[24:53.76]It just was.
[25:01.40]It's like, how could I decline one of my most streamed video games on this whole channel?
[25:08.51]A sponsor to play that.
[25:12.49]I would be crazy to not do that.
[25:22.01]Yeah, and I'm just going to be playing it and hanging out and having a good time.
[25:26.50]What are you going to do while they build?
[25:29.12]So, the way that I did it this year was to make it so there was as little downtime as possible.
[25:35.57]So while player A...
[25:38.67]While player A's are giving me their tours for the first build, player B's are going to go start their build to make it so there's no downtime.
[25:48.40]So I will be doing tours with player A groups and then immediately going into the 20 minute, uh, no, not 20 minutes, the player B groups.
[25:59.52]And then right after that, they're going... I'm going to have only probably about 90 minutes or so.
[26:04.30]Maybe like an hour or two of downtime.
[26:06.56]But I'll just build something too.
[26:08.17]There's a lot of tools in it.
[26:12.15]How long is the whole stream?
[26:13.27]I want it to be under five hours.
[26:18.13]I would say between four hours and 45 minutes to five and a half hours total.
[26:23.85]Including outros for me.
[26:26.45]So if you want to go with the list, right?
[26:27.75]Like, oh, why did you put certain people in certain places?
[26:30.87]There were people that had really strict hard outs for this show.
[26:35.47]So everything you see up here for teams is only solely based on, does this person have a hard out and time zones?
[26:45.49]So you can see where most of the East Coast, if not European people are, hard out.
[26:55.76]Hard out.
[26:58.68]Because after about 3, 4, 5, 6 hours, it's going to be like 2 o'clock in the morning EU.
[27:04.63]And I don't want people to have to sit around that long.
[27:08.69]A hard out.
[27:09.61]Like they have an obligation they have to do at a certain time and they can't be here.
[27:14.16]Come on, Gwen.
[27:18.94]You can tell he's in his bathroom.
[27:20.84]Shut up.
[27:26.40]Nobody has ever said that.
[27:28.81]I, it's, I say that to people, we say that, that's like a thing every, what are you talking about?
[27:39.45]You are just fucking being weird.
[27:41.43]Hey, can you put on Polish subtitles?
[27:46.80]I can't understand anything.
[27:49.68]What?
[27:51.80]You mean like right now?
[27:53.00]Alright.
[27:54.06]Okay.
[27:54.30]Alright.
[27:54.56]Alright.
[27:54.82]Alright.
[27:55.10]Let's go.
[27:55.40]Let's go.
[27:56.64]So things for everybody to know for tomorrow.
[28:02.01]First of all,
[28:04.16]We have a pretty clean kind of tight ship right now, and I'm really hoping it stays that way.
[28:09.12]But there are 18 people.
[28:11.32]There's a lot going on.
[28:12.76]There's a lot of builds.
[28:13.90]There's a lot of sharing files and shit.
[28:16.38]So just, I guess, kind of bear with us.
[28:19.73]I'm trying to plan for as little downtime as humanly possible.
[28:24.19]I spent the last like four or five days just only doing this.
[28:29.25]So I've just been literally spending all day and all night just trying to make sure this is happening.
[28:37.01]Will you have a face cam?
[28:38.19]Yeah, I will.
[28:38.95]This is absolutely.
[28:42.04]So something else really cool is and I got to
[28:44.89]figure out a way to do this correctly.
[28:46.33]But the game because it allows a really seamless kind of swapping files.
[28:53.06]I don't think we need to do the screen sharing bullshit anymore.
[28:56.96]So when somebody like Joel or RT or some of the East Coast people screen share to me, it's not going to be like 1200 kilobytes in like 25 frames a second.
[29:09.38]So I'll be able to really show these houses as good as I can because I'm going to be using their actual files and walking around the real actual house.
[29:21.03]Which was funny.
[29:21.81]Yeah, it was funny.
[29:22.55]But at the same time, I want to be able to see.
[29:25.57]And there was at least three or four and even just not low bitrate.
[29:29.95]But, you know, I want to see this in 60 FPS, not 25.
[29:39.33]You gonna wear a fancy suit?
[29:42.47]Nah.
[29:47.29]What about Poke's music bits?
[29:51.04]Unfortunately, I don't think House Slipper 2 allows for audio to be put into the game.
[29:58.52]Again, it's hard to tell.
[30:00.80]There's a lot of maybes, ifs, or I don't know because the game isn't out yet and we've had access to it for, I want to say two or three days now.
[30:08.36]So we're still kind of learning and trying to get prepared for the event.
[30:18.75]There you go.
[30:19.05]You should wear a fake tuxedo t-shirt.
[30:24.05]No, I'm going to be in pajamas.
[30:35.32]You get that haircut yet?
[30:36.40]No.
[30:38.54]No, I'm going to wear a hat.
[30:40.92]I'm going to put all my hair under a hat tomorrow.
[30:50.64]Fur pajamas?
[30:54.12]I was with you guys right now.
[30:58.42]But I'm trying to think of anything else I want to bring up.
[31:02.57]that I won't bring up tomorrow in the intro.
[31:04.97]Because to make sure this show is five hours long, there is no intro.
[31:09.13]There is a, hey everybody, welcome.
[31:12.33]Are we ready?
[31:13.02]Okay.
[31:14.82]All player A's, please get ready.
[31:17.88]Here is your theme that I'm going to tell you right now.
[31:21.18]Good luck.
[31:21.78]Here it is.
[31:22.82]Go.
[31:23.02]Did you do a man bun?
[31:30.95]I don't think I can do a man bun.
[31:33.69]My hair is really long in the back, but not that long in the front.
[31:37.11]I mean, it kind of is, but... Maybe I could.
[31:40.83]I'm not going to, but maybe I could.
[31:48.09]Can you address the swollen balls allegations?
[31:50.65]Nah.
[31:50.97]I mean, they're swollen.
[31:53.55]That's all there is to it.
[31:56.56]Wait, that's a poke thing.
[32:02.47]Alright, thanks for the question.
[32:03.31]Appreciate the feedback.
[32:08.63]Alright, any questions?
[32:10.45]Do any of you have any questions?
[32:15.40]What are the questions?
[32:24.24]No, no, no, no.
[32:25.48]Somebody said, what toilet paper do you use?
[32:27.33]No, questions about the event tomorrow at 1pm Pacific time.
[32:36.89]When's the stream going to start?
[32:38.15]1pm Pacific.
[32:39.23]It's going to be pretty strict.
[32:41.38]I want to get in there.
[32:48.82]Did you fix the face cam?
[32:50.94]I'll get on that after I turn the stream off.
[32:55.32]You should be in a caveman outfit.
[32:58.52]Can you give us a hint for the themes?
[33:01.41]No, because then the streamers will have a hint for the themes.
[33:04.83]And I do not want that.
[33:07.84]Because you are going to go into Squeaks' chat right now and say the thing that I say.
[33:12.82]You'll be lightning quick.
[33:16.82]You will go into Ster's chat right now and just say, hey, the theme tomorrow is this.
[33:23.13]Slow down.
[33:31.01]Just make something up so you confuse them.
[33:32.67]That's a good idea.
[33:39.58]Oh, we have to do... Okay, let's do a vote.
[33:42.48]Will there be +2 points to your final grade if you do a Marge Simpson impression?
[33:47.53]Even if it's bad.
[33:48.43]Like, you can choose not to.
[33:49.75]It's extra credit.
[33:54.05]Like, you can get two points of extra credit on your build if you do a Marge Simpson impression.
[34:00.74]Should we do that?
[34:06.00]Should it be one point?
[34:06.98]I feel like, I don't know.
[34:07.72]What if that is the determining factor?
[34:09.14]Everyone's going to do it.
[34:10.24]So it's just a free two points for everybody.
[34:13.46]Maybe somebody doesn't do it.
[34:15.60]Who wouldn't do it?
[34:16.58]I don't know.
[34:19.78]It should be Lois Griffin.
[34:22.56]+2 for Jess Marge, plus four if they do the entire family.
[34:27.06]No, we got a five hour time constraint.
[34:30.05]We're not sitting there for two to three minutes for each person to do every single character in The Simpsons.
[34:42.55]Plus one if they do it, +2 if it's good.
[34:45.17]Yeah, but how do we determine if it's good?
[34:52.62]Can you do a Marge impression?
[34:55.74]You'll see tomorrow.
[35:01.04]Yeah, it's going to be fun, though.
[35:03.00]The two secret themes, I think, are really funny.
[35:05.56]I think they're fun.
[35:07.66]They're at least interesting enough where I feel like it's going to be... I'm very curious what people do specifically for these first two.
[35:23.41]He's not going to do it, guys.
[35:28.11]You should have a new twerk segment.
[35:29.33]The new TOS allows it.
[35:32.80]um nah not this event who's gonna get last place you shouldn't care about that it's all this none of this is means anything guys of the great the philosophy grade to give in a house slipper house
[35:56.34]This is absolute horseshit.
[35:58.04]It's just for fun.
[35:58.84]Like this whole thing is just for fun.
[36:00.41]This whole thing is an excuse to get 18 people to play House Flipper and like, enjoy it and love it like I do.
[36:10.43]It's like, this is my grand scheme to be like, everybody should play House Flipper because the fucking game is awesome.
[36:19.43]That's what the first one was, honestly.
[36:28.68]Yeah, there's no prize.
[36:30.83]We talked maybe briefly about a prize and what that could be.
[36:34.01]Nah, this whole thing is going to be attached to nothing.
[36:38.69]It's just a bunch of streamers that you might know are going to make goofy-ass houses in House Flipper 2 for the launch of the game.
[36:48.62]That's what the event is, and I think it's going to be fun.
[36:58.51]What's House Flipper, man?
[37:05.10]You're not asking that question, right?
[37:14.82]What if somebody's late?
[37:17.75]If somebody is late, then that person's partner is going to have to be player A.
[37:24.64]That's the way that that works, I think.
[37:27.24]So not saying this is going to happen, but I'm not going to even say a name because I don't want to put that into the world.
[37:34.42]But if somebody from their team is not there, then the person that is there is player A. So let's hope they get there in 25 minutes.
[37:54.47]What if poke goes to the aquarium?
[37:56.06]Alright.
[37:56.78]Make sure we got to make sure the poke does not go to the aquarium tomorrow.
[38:01.50]Does he have a plan to go to the aquarium?
[38:09.34]That was so fun.
[38:12.10]I loved every second of that.
[38:17.28]Is it split up into multiple days?
[38:18.70]Nope.
[38:19.94]Just one day, just tomorrow.
[38:23.51]Blocking out the time for, if you do about like a, and this, we've tested this a few times at least.
[38:29.50]Doing the first two builds takes about three to five minutes to kind of say what you want to say about the room.
[38:36.40]So with, I'll take a look.
[38:38.32]You got nine builds to get through for the first build.
[38:42.58]And we're about three, four minutes per small talk.
[38:45.32]Because it's only one room.
[38:46.64]It's one small room.
[38:48.53]It's not a huge thing.
[38:50.23]These first two builds are 35 by 35 living rooms.
[38:54.61]It's not like a giant house.
[38:55.73]It's a pre-built just space to decorate and put furnishing in.
[39:09.47]Three to five minutes.
[39:10.35]That's not happening.
[39:12.47]Um, you'd be surprised.
[39:13.29]Because in the five times that I timed somebody doing this, in about two minutes, they were done.
[39:20.28]The room is not big.
[39:21.40]It is only a 35 by 35 living room.
[39:23.80]That's it.
[39:30.69]You have to go offline.
[39:31.51]It's been 40 minutes.
[39:33.07]Oh, okay.
[39:38.61]Wait, let me resize this.
[39:41.69]There.
[39:43.71]So how do we feel?
[39:45.35]Are we ready for tomorrow?
[39:46.81]Do you feel like you're gonna have a good time tomorrow?
[39:49.10]I hope you do.
[39:54.22]No.
[39:59.40]Um, this is gonna be fun.
[40:00.30]It's gonna be fun.
[40:04.90]Can we bring snacks?
[40:05.70]Yeah, bring as many snacks as you want.
[40:12.28]Can you give Marge for us right now so they can be kind of like a guideline of what I'm looking for?
[40:22.20]No, I'm not doing it.
[40:24.47]I know at least one person out of the 12,000 people here right now.
[40:28.01]I guarantee you at least one of you here has a folder on your computer that is Jerma's Marge impressions.
[40:36.35]There's 15 audio files in there.
[40:38.61]No, I'm not going to let you add it to the collection.
[40:50.37]We already got 20 of them in there.
[40:52.65]Just go listen to one from like 2018 or something.
[41:03.56]It never hurts to do one more.
[41:05.58]We need the 21st one.
[41:16.98]Yeah, in a perfect kind of world for me, I wanted to have 10 teams.
[41:23.99]But when I started blocking out the times, seven or eight was too many.
[41:29.50]So I had to put a hard cap on nine.
[41:35.29]There are other people that I would want in this event, but it's just not enough time.
[41:39.65]It's just not enough.
[41:41.11]And I didn't want to do this over two or three days because then you're talking about commitments from 20 streamers for more than two or three days.
[41:48.69]At that point, then I am taking a lot of their time and I don't want to do that.
[42:05.07]Can you repeat everything you just said?
[42:07.81]Yeah, I can repeat literally every single thing I just said.
[42:12.35]One word for word, second by second.
[42:18.10]All you need to do is just wait till this stream turns off and then click the VOD and I'll do it again.
[42:33.80]Are you playing YouTube today?
[42:35.22]I actually can't even hear it.
[42:36.80]Does it sound good?
[42:38.46]It sounded good when I played it.
[42:39.28]Alright, everybody.
[42:41.89]That's it.
[42:43.03]See you tomorrow.
[42:43.93]I just wanted to make sure that I told you guys the rules and what my plan was and who's in it.
[42:49.47]So this wasn't like a huge, what the fuck is going on tomorrow?
[42:53.90]There you go.
[42:54.88]That's the format.
[42:55.92]That's, I mean, this is obviously way more info, but that's the overview.
[43:04.12]I am excited.
[43:04.94]Every time there's something fun going on the next day, I'm sure a lot of people will like this, but I got to try to get to bed early, eat, and go to sleep.
[43:12.56]And I'm going to be rolling around going like, what is Seadog going to make?
[43:18.11]Oh, but DuckDuck.
[43:19.87]But Ster.
[43:21.47]What's Ster going to make?
[43:24.95]So it's going to be a very, very fun day.
[43:29.63]And I'll see you tomorrow.
[43:32.32]Have a great one.
[43:33.12]I know that this is an announcement for a stream that's literally tomorrow, so if people are not aware, we're going to make an announcement in the Discord anyways.
[43:39.82]But, uh, yeah, spread it around.
[43:41.88]Tell people.
[43:42.66]If somebody's looking forward to asking about it, be like, hey, it's tomorrow.
[43:48.65]And that's it.
[43:50.67]Exactly 40-minute stream, like I said in the title.
[43:55.91]See ya tomorrow.
[43:56.97]See ya tomorrow.
[44:02.83]What time?
[44:03.33]1 p.m.
[44:04.85]Let me write it right here so you can get a screenshot.
[44:10.27]1 p.m.
[44:10.75]PT.
[44:14.84]I gotta rest my voice, too.
[44:16.10]My voice is like... I don't know why it's so dead lately.
[44:19.76]It's been like this for a while.
[44:22.06]There you go.
[44:31.25]This is tomorrow.
[44:33.54]There's your total info.
[44:40.27]What if you're too sick to stream tomorrow?
[44:42.91]Ban that person for 10 minutes.
[44:45.62]Don't say that.
[44:47.00]Don't say that.
[44:56.36]10-minute ban.
[44:57.14]Streams have months from until tomorrow, yeah.
[45:00.06]Alright, guys.
[45:00.42]I'll see you later.
[45:01.44]Take care.
[45:01.92]There's not going to be an outro or anything.
[45:03.11]I'm just going to turn it off.
[45:05.41]See you soon.
[45:05.97]See you tomorrow, 1 p.m.
[45:06.97]Pacific.
[45:07.83]It's going to be fun.
[45:08.71]There's going to be a lot of wacky moments.
[45:14.54]See you soon.
[45:15.50]See you later.
[45:17.30]Take care.
[45:39.80]Hold on, I have one question I want to read out loud.
[45:42.77]Would judging build one take out the talking time for person B in build two?
[45:48.81]Also, do they get to pick the order for who goes when during build three?
[45:51.61]They do.
[45:52.87]So they'll be able to pick who is going to be A and B. And for some cases, when they do the build together, some people have outs that some people have to leave.
[46:04.69]So after 45 minutes, when they swap to the next player, that player will take over.
[46:12.30]But yeah, so the idea is that nobody really has that much downtime because last time it was like two plus three plus hours of downtime for some people.
[46:21.98]I do not want to do that again.
[46:24.39]So breaking it up into like player A, you build.
[46:27.32]Player B, you build now.
[46:29.70]And then we do the tours for player A and then player B tours and then both players build.
[46:33.96]I just want to be courteous of people's time because, you know, hey, come to my House Flipper event.
[46:40.50]Build a House Flipper house.
[46:41.73]It's going to be so much fun.
[46:43.11]Come on in.
[46:43.73]Yeah.
[46:44.93]Okay, now sit there for four hours with nothing left to do.
[46:50.13]So we'll see if it works out.
[46:55.09]Ludwig was watching YouTube videos.
[46:56.77]Yeah.
[46:57.29]Yeah.
[46:57.95]I mean, I don't blame him.
[47:00.77]It's a lot of downtime that I'm trying to avoid.
[47:05.20]Alright.
[47:05.82]See you later.
[47:06.22]Have a great night.
[47:07.08]Call your mother.
[47:07.88]See you soon.
[47:08.56]See you tomorrow.
[47:09.60]1 p.m.
[47:10.48]P.T.
[47:11.12]House Flipper 2 launch event.
[47:13.10]Oh.
