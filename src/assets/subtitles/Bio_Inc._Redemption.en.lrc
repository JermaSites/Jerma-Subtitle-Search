[00:32.20]Fuckin' dammit, I messed up my goddamn tweet.
[00:36.11]I- I- Just- Tit V TV.
[00:39.75]Glad I just did that.
[00:40.63]I deleted it instantly.
[00:42.39]I deleted that tweet faster than a politician would delete something like that.
[00:45.93]You know what I mean?
[00:46.37]Like, I was on top of that like a second went by.
[00:50.32]Made a tweet, had a fucked up link in it, gone in less than a tenth of a second.
[00:55.18]Get me on your social media team.
[00:56.62]I can take care of it.
[00:59.86]Hold on.
[01:00.66]Let me redo it.
[01:01.28]Just give me a sec.
[01:43.31]Yeah, the last... Don't click on the last tweet.
[01:46.76]I deleted it instantly.
[01:49.66]Fucking tit V DTV.
[01:51.98]Yeah, I can't wait.
[01:53.72]God damn, man.
[01:54.62]Give me a break.
[01:58.40]Oh, hi, guys.
[01:59.86]My name's Jeremy.
[02:00.48]Nice to see you.
[02:00.98]Good to see you.
[02:01.40]Good to meet you.
[02:04.83]You thought it was Monster Rancher?
[02:06.79]Not tonight.
[02:08.15]We're going to do something different.
[02:09.09]We're going to just take a break from Monster Rancher.
[02:11.11]Because we did a poll last time and people said they wanted to do... People were more interested in just going right to Monster Rancher 2.
[02:18.41]So, Monster Rancher 2 is going to be next week on Tuesday.
[02:21.26]For the next couple days, we're going to just chill.
[02:24.10]Have a little bit of a fun time.
[02:26.44]Play a couple of oddities.
[02:29.88]Maybe Vermintide.
[02:31.38]Vermintide's out.
[02:35.77]Yeah, I'm on time.
[02:36.99]I'm very much on time.
[02:40.79]Do I like Skittles?
[02:41.63]I do.
[02:42.69]The one thing that I don't like about Skittles, though, are just how they turn your spit into cement.
[02:49.04]If you eat Skittles, you better... You can't even brush your teeth.
[02:51.76]It doesn't fix anything.
[02:54.32]Skittles are the milk of the candy world.
[02:58.69]You can't just chug milk.
[03:01.19]And once you do, you get that milk taste in your mouth.
[03:03.17]You get the thick milk taste.
[03:05.23]It doesn't go away for like four days.
[03:09.35]It's the milk of candy.
[03:13.98]What do you mean you never had that problem?
[03:15.98]Next time you eat a bag of Skittles, go into your sink and just spit.
[03:19.36]And watch what happens.
[03:20.00]It turns into glue.
[03:22.48]You have rubber bands coming out of your mouth when you spit out Skittles.
[03:26.02]Try it.
[03:26.80]Didn't you guys ever see Big Daddy?
[03:30.06]This is a reference to Big Daddy, okay?
[03:36.90]Anyways.
[03:39.00]Tonight we're gonna play Bio Inc.
[03:40.96]It's a game where you watch people get illnesses and you have to cure them or you can give them more illnesses.
[03:46.77]It just popped up on Steam.
[03:47.93]Seems like it's pretty fun.
[03:49.55]We can kill some time with it.
[03:52.09]While we wait for Monster Rancher 2 Waiting Room.
[03:56.62]It's like pretty much the next two streams.
[04:01.81]Storm did not do that much damage or anything, so... But we got another problem here.
[04:08.90]Unfortunately, we're gonna... Unfortunately, guys, we have to do something.
[04:13.20]We gotta go over the facts.
[04:16.08]And the facts are this.
[04:17.96]Apparently, over the last week or so, an animal, I think, may have died in my wall.
[04:25.03]So, there's not much I can do about it.
[04:27.73]It stinks in here.
[04:29.66]It smells like a rotting dead carcass in this room.
[04:34.62]And this is where all my streaming stuff is.
[04:36.74]So, it's not... It's gonna be fucking hell, me being down here.
[04:41.32]Already, it's causing me problems.
[04:42.59]My eyes are watering a little bit.
[04:45.67]So, I don't know what happened, but it's not good.
[04:51.15]If this continues, I'm gonna have to call somebody.
[04:55.62]I don't know what happened.
[04:57.48]But those are the facts.
[04:59.28]So hopefully I don't... I got to like fucking open my window for the stream properly.
[05:04.57]And it's really cold out.
[05:05.47]So this is going to be... This is going to be like a really strange day.
[05:09.73]And hopefully it's not like this tomorrow.
[05:12.19]That's it.
[05:12.61]Those are the facts.
[05:14.10]We're going to move on now.
[05:14.72]We're going to play the game.
[05:15.44]This is Bio Inc.
[05:18.26]Make sure I got my... I got it.
[05:19.60]It's ready.
[05:19.98]It's right here.
[05:24.11]Exhaust fan out the window, but it's so cold though.
[05:26.67]I'm gonna have to like I have to go back and forth between opening and closing the window Fits the game about diseases.
[05:35.19]Yeah, it sure does Speaking of which let's move over there now.
[05:40.52]I can turn this back here Uh-huh.
[05:44.70]Hey, look at that So this game might be awful.
[05:47.70]I don't know.
[05:48.22]It might be just we're just gonna have we're just gonna chill and
[05:52.31]Nothing really intense is going to happen on this stream.
[05:55.37]For you guys.
[05:56.19]See, for me, I have to deal with the fact that my house smells like a rotting carcass.
[06:02.61]So there's that.
[06:03.68]Plus, I need to turn the volume back up here.
[06:07.78]Start our track at track one, I guess.
[06:10.20]Oh, we're on volume.
[06:12.12]We are?
[06:12.34]So I have no idea what this game's about.
[06:16.66]All I know is you make illnesses...
[06:22.83]Or you fight illnesses.
[06:24.41]It's kind of a combination of a bunch of things.
[06:27.19]We'll see if it's any good.
[06:31.23]Alright.
[06:33.59]Here we go.
[06:34.59]So we can either choose life or we can choose death.
[06:37.09]We could explore your dark side by terminating people and giving them illnesses.
[06:41.48]Or we can try to protect people.
[06:43.26]And try to cure people.
[06:44.34]I'm going to assume because this is twitch.tv everyone wants me to choose death here.
[06:48.88]So...
[06:52.09]We're going to start with death.
[06:55.19]There's apparently multiplayer.
[06:56.75]Okay, death.
[06:58.77]We have death tutorial, death campaign.
[07:00.54]Let's do the tutorial.
[07:01.48]Learn the basics on how to terminate your victims.
[07:03.34]This is getting weird, but... This is getting a little weird.
[07:07.72]Learn the basics on how to terminate your victims.
[07:09.46]Finish the tutorial.
[07:10.38]Okay.
[07:12.32]This might be a little too loud.
[07:14.94]Welcome to the Bio Inc.
[07:15.92]death tutorial.
[07:16.54]We will quickly teach you all the basics so you can terminate your first victim.
[07:20.32]Start.
[07:21.76]Okay, so overall health.
[07:24.12]This is your victim's overall health.
[07:25.40]100%.
[07:26.32]Okay, got it.
[07:29.60]The more systems you terminate, the faster the overall health will decline.
[07:34.08]Got it, so this has got respiratory, digestive, skeletal, nervous, renal, immune, and muscular.
[07:40.84]Okay.
[07:42.22]This is your victim.
[07:43.32]Viruses and bacteria will spawn here.
[07:45.20]Harvesting them will enable you to earn and spend bio points to upgrade diseases.
[07:54.63]Okay.
[07:55.71]Now let's harvest some resources.
[07:59.85]Click the highlighted system, so this is respiratory.
[08:02.75]Click and hold your left mouse button over the virus.
[08:06.37]A.K.A.
[08:07.64]my intro from 2012.
[08:09.30]Some of you guys are going to see that and it's going to blow your mind.
[08:15.04]It's blowing my mind right now.
[08:18.06]Does it explode?
[08:18.94]Like my old intro does?
[08:23.14]Pretty much.
[08:25.14]Uh, great job!
[08:26.02]Okay, now collect 12 bio points.
[08:30.92]So, are we gonna go to different diseases?
[08:33.70]Respiratory, digestive... Skeletal... Nervous... Oh, circulatory!
[08:40.61]We got some more Jerma intros!
[08:45.79]I guess it just tells you where they are.
[08:48.11]Muscular... This is so dumb.
[08:55.05]Okay.
[08:57.21]Perfect.
[08:57.51]Now that you have enough bio points, click the bio map button.
[09:03.03]The bio map is where you can evolve disease, risk factor, and items to slow down recovery.
[09:09.35]This is how many bio points you currently have.
[09:12.43]These buttons enable navigation between different categories of items you can evolve.
[09:15.91]Okay.
[09:17.97]Let's start by upgrading a first disease in the respiratory system.
[09:22.64]Alright.
[09:23.12]Coughing.
[09:24.92]Click the flu node.
[09:27.60]These both could be flu.
[09:30.46]It's this one.
[09:30.90]Okay, flu.
[09:32.40]Influenza is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system, your nose, throat, and lungs.
[09:38.04]Am I going to kill this guy with the flu?
[09:39.94]Evolve the disease.
[09:40.76]Alright, nice, you've evolved your first disease.
[09:46.82]Listen to him, he's like coughing.
[09:48.30]Now evolve your flu to the H1Z1 flu.
[09:53.25]Kill your game by separating it into two games.
[09:55.75]And then charge for both of them.
[09:58.25]And then charge for tickets to play Battle Royale.
[10:02.93]And then get completely overtaken in market share by a game that was made as a Minecraft shooter.
[10:11.73]These indicators show how much damage a disease is causing to each system.
[10:18.55]Okay, so it's causing 16% damage.
[10:22.62]Evolve it again.
[10:23.18]Okay, perfect.
[10:29.45]Now close the biomap.
[10:31.95]How's he doing?
[10:35.57]Respiratory.
[10:36.33]Oh, his... Alright, I caved in one of his lungs, apparently.
[10:41.99]I don't remember the flu doing that to me.
[10:44.27]Look, respiratory system health is declining.
[10:46.09]This is great news!
[10:49.51]I don't think a doctor would tell you that.
[10:52.40]You can earn more bio points by upgrading your resource levels.
[10:55.34]Okay, upgrade.
[10:59.87]Click the upgrade button to upgrade your harvesting power.
[11:03.89]Okay, so plus 40% harvest power, respiratory system health must be lower than 80%.
[11:07.51]Alright, we got more things to click on here?
[11:13.37]Visit to the doctor.
[11:14.19]Symptoms are worsening.
[11:15.13]John Smith is going to visit the doctor.
[11:19.34]Symptoms are worsening.
[11:19.98]John Smith is going to visit doctor.
[11:21.02]Doctor will now investigate the symptoms and treat the illnesses.
[11:24.00]What's next?
[11:24.46]Recovery progress will start.
[11:25.68]Doctors will try to cure John Smith's diseases.
[11:29.80]So what he's saying is we've got to give him... So this is essentially... This is Plague Inc.
[11:34.26]But on one guy.
[11:37.93]The whole purpose of Plague Inc.
[11:39.01]is you try to wipe out the world.
[11:40.31]The whole purpose of this game, apparently, is you try to wipe out this one guy.
[11:43.63]This is just reverse Osmosis Jones.
[11:46.53]We're working from the inside out to try to get rid of this guy.
[11:50.49]Alright, recovery.
[11:51.11]Once your victim has made his first visit to the doctor, his medical team will try to neutralize diseases and cure him.
[11:55.65]I don't know if you're going to be able to cure that.
[12:01.16]You can see in real time which diagnostic tests and treatments they're executing.
[12:05.82]They're putting a stethoscope on him.
[12:07.52]They're giving him some metabolic panel.
[12:10.86]That's quick.
[12:13.01]Treatment's flu, okay.
[12:16.54]John Smith is getting a rapid flu test.
[12:21.05]The doctor accidentally stabbed him.
[12:23.97]Neurological exam.
[12:25.07]Okay, here comes treatments for flu.
[12:28.43]When diseases are treated, the total recovery progress increases.
[12:31.53]If this number reaches 100% before you terminate your victim or complete the stage objective, you will lose.
[12:39.12]This tutorial objective is to evolve four diseases.
[12:41.48]Evolve two more diseases to complete the tutorial.
[12:44.10]You got it.
[12:48.97]Alright, what do we got?
[12:49.73]Biomap?
[12:50.45]Roadmap?
[12:50.93]How's he doing?
[12:53.36]He's not being treated for anything.
[12:57.78]What do we got with Biomap?
[12:58.42]Let's take a look.
[12:59.90]Uh, male.
[13:02.62]Just like me.
[13:04.08]He- I got all these symptoms.
[13:06.10]He needs a fucking haircut.
[13:08.69]He's bald.
[13:09.21]Alright, we're gonna make him bald.
[13:13.45]Why is that a disease?
[13:16.29]Hair loss.
[13:17.17]In men, this condition is also known as male pattern baldness.
[13:20.17]Hair loss is a well-defined pat- Alright, he's bald now.
[13:26.09]Why is that so bad?
[13:29.93]How is that a bad thing?
[13:34.73]How- we can't even see that.
[13:41.26]That's not a disease!
[13:43.88]That's called aging!
[13:49.52]Alright, we got... Is he getting treated?
[13:51.54]A routine physical exam is being performed on John Smith.
[13:54.02]I wonder if he's going to get treated for baldness.
[14:00.01]What would that be even under?
[14:02.49]Skeletal?
[14:03.09]No.
[14:04.31]Circulatory?
[14:05.03]Alright, is there an upgrade to evolve baldness?
[14:11.29]No, just causes anxiety.
[14:12.57]Alright, what about this one?
[14:15.56]Uh, hemophilia is a rare disorder in which your blood doesn't clot normally.
[14:18.82]Uh, are we just going right for cancer here?
[14:22.96]That's not good.
[14:25.10]No, not yet.
[14:27.46]These ones are locked.
[14:29.43]We'll give him bronchitis.
[14:31.83]Chronic bronchitis.
[14:35.09]Oh, I hate that.
[14:36.57]Oh, I hate that.
[14:37.37]I don't like that.
[14:39.75]Great, you've now completed the bio-ink death tutorial.
[14:41.61]You can now experiment with new strategies on your own.
[14:45.80]Hey, just in case you're wondering, you exercise 36 muscles when you smile.
[14:49.04]Alright, choose department.
[14:54.58]The morgue, graveyard, slaughterhouse, terminal victims, seven more skulls to unlock.
[15:01.24]Uh, morgue.
[15:04.12]Victim has a poor lifestyle and is average shape.
[15:08.66]Alright.
[15:10.09]Name your victim.

[16:11.89]All you guys writing Clark Kent are just totally wrong.
[16:13.89]It's like an alien name.
[16:15.08]It's Ca- Caillou?
[16:17.16]Caillou?
[16:18.74]Cal L. See?
[16:20.28]That's the real name.
[16:22.90]Everyone's saying Clark Kent.
[16:26.22]No, that's dumb.
[16:28.14]I like, um... What's a Joker's real name?
[16:35.44]John Joker?
[16:37.37]Buy my own superheroes.
[16:38.55]No, that's stupid.
[16:39.81]No one's going to think that's funny.
[16:41.57]How about... He doesn't have one.
[16:46.60]Yes, he does.
[16:48.60]The name doesn't even matter.
[16:49.56]How about just Jeremy?
[16:58.36]We'll do all of my diseases.
[16:59.76]I got it.
[17:00.36]That's perfect.
[17:01.66]I'm going to show you guys all my illnesses.
[17:05.34]Jeremy.
[17:06.84]Moderate is fine.
[17:07.70]I'm going to do all my diseases.
[17:08.86]You're going to see them in real time.
[17:14.47]All booster slots are currently locked.
[17:17.45]I'm serious.
[17:18.11]We're going to see if they have them.
[17:23.09]I mean, my lifestyle is not that terrible.
[17:24.61]Terminate Jeremy.
[17:25.73]Okay, that's the objective.
[17:29.01]Jeremy has a poor lifestyle and is in average shape.
[17:31.41]No boosters.
[17:32.13]I don't have any fucking Candy Crush boosters.
[17:34.99]Use damage systems and pre-evolved wrist back just to your advantage.
[17:39.41]Alright, so.
[17:40.67]First of all, I have colitis.
[17:43.85]Digestive.
[17:44.37]I already have digestive problems.
[17:45.83]I didn't even need to do anything.
[17:50.47]What do I have?
[17:52.35]What's this say?
[17:55.98]I want to scroll over this.
[17:57.46]Alright, let's go Biomap Digestive.
[17:59.34]Where's colitis?
[18:05.07]This is... Okay, 71.
[18:06.43]We got this one.
[18:07.15]What is this?
[18:08.09]Gastroenteritis.
[18:09.91]Salmonella.
[18:11.17]Type 1 diabetes.
[18:12.31]Alright, well, hold on.
[18:13.19]Where's colitis?
[18:15.11]Where's, like, ulcerative colitis?
[18:17.26]Constipation.
[18:19.10]I mean, I'm not necessarily constipated.
[18:20.98]But I guess sometimes I can be.
[18:25.26]We'll go with that.
[18:28.36]Nope.
[18:29.34]I thought that was just, like, a shitting noise.
[18:30.86]Okay, well, how about... Gastroenteritis.
[18:34.50]I guess you could say it starts with this.
[18:37.34]Nope, can't do that either.
[18:38.24]I need some points.
[18:39.04]Let's go get some points.
[18:41.77]We need to make this as close to me as possible.
[18:44.29]Okay, we got seven points.
[18:52.49]Digestive Biomap.
[18:55.97]Uh, male, I wonder, no.
[18:58.09]Okay, well, we'll start with baldness, right?
[18:59.91]Because that's the easiest one.
[19:00.83]I have hair loss.
[19:02.51]It is happening.
[19:03.06]My risk factors are pregnancy, overweight, apparently I'm overweight, obese.
[19:11.34]That might be me in like 10 years.
[19:13.60]Old, I'm overweight, I'm old, I'm unlucky.
[19:18.38]I'm not a smoker though.
[19:20.24]Excuse me, can I remove this?
[19:24.47]Like, I love gambling.
[19:25.73]I'm old.
[19:26.31]I'm kind of getting fat.
[19:27.17]That is my body.
[19:28.53]Remember when I did the fucking attack on Titan thing?
[19:30.63]That is me.
[19:33.09]I just don't smoke.
[19:35.14]Workaholic.
[19:36.10]I take my work pretty seriously.
[19:39.20]And... Alright, no, hold on.
[19:41.86]Malnutrition.
[19:43.08]Hereditary.
[19:46.52]No, we can't look at these yet.
[19:48.20]No, I don't want no recovery yet.
[19:52.43]Bald.
[19:54.24]And I got, how many points do I got?
[19:55.80]Four.
[19:58.00]I still need, no, I need four, I need a few more points.
[20:03.02]I haven't been to the doctor in like four years, so that's good that I haven't been there yet.
[20:10.85]There we go.
[20:14.55]Let's just collect for a minute here, before I go do anything crazy.
[20:23.16]Okay, let's go.
[20:26.06]Here's the stomach we got.
[20:27.04]Gastroenteritis.
[20:28.62]Viral gastroenteritis, stomach flu is an intestinal infection marked by watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea or vomiting, and sometimes a fever.
[20:38.49]Yeah, I don't have diabetes.
[20:39.95]I don't have salmonella.
[20:40.77]Let's go.
[20:41.51]Diarrhea.
[20:41.95]That's important, right?
[20:42.99]Just got it.
[20:43.47]Bingo.
[20:43.85]Diarrhea.
[20:50.49]Okay.
[20:54.68]That was gross.
[20:56.96]That was really gross.
[21:00.82]Bingo.
[21:03.75]I'm probably going to go to the doctor here soon.
[21:07.67]Immune?
[21:08.19]I mean, colitis is an autoimmune disease, right?
[21:11.17]So where's the immunity?
[21:14.75]Insomnia?
[21:15.41]I got that.
[21:17.35]Photosensitivity?
[21:18.25]I'm not sure about that one.
[21:19.47]Asthma?
[21:19.73]I don't have asthma.
[21:20.59]I definitely have insomnia, though.
[21:22.39]Let's do it.
[21:24.49]Chronic fatigue.
[21:25.31]I am insomniac and I have chronic fatigue.
[21:27.64]We're gonna go down this path.
[21:28.54]Alright, my health is doing not so good.
[21:36.26]So we got diarrhea, baldness, and insomnia.
[21:39.06]So far, this is pretty close to being real.
[21:44.65]I mean, I would still be at 90% health.
[21:46.31]I would agree.
[21:50.27]Hypochondriac?
[21:51.81]I'm not a hypochondriac!
[21:53.59]What?
[21:55.65]I actually am getting kind of fat though, that's funny.
[21:58.89]Okay, I can upgrade.
[21:59.81]Immune system health must be lower than 80%.
[22:03.09]Upgrade.
[22:05.23]What?
[22:06.71]I need four.
[22:07.87]I need two more.
[22:11.36]Come on.
[22:14.38]Here we go.
[22:16.38]This increases the amount of these little globs you can break.
[22:20.94]No, I want to upgrade.
[22:24.53]Bingo.
[22:25.05]Okay.
[22:26.85]More bio points are being collected here.
[22:30.53]Still haven't gone to the doctor.
[22:38.86]So far so good.
[22:39.44]I don't understand the blood.
[22:44.66]Why would blood just be ripping out of my body?
[22:49.92]Let's go with maybe two or three more.
[22:52.83]See where we are in the... My bones are fine.
[22:56.65]My respiratory system is fine.
[22:58.11]I mean, I got cold hands and cold feet.
[23:01.50]Is that a symptom here?
[23:04.92]No, let's stick with the digestive tract.
[23:07.58]That sounds like the most plug in Biomap.
[23:09.41]Here we go.
[23:11.84]This is locked.
[23:13.44]Looks like I need to get salmonella and have diarrhea.
[23:16.20]So, I need 12 points for this.
[23:18.60]To go this way.
[23:19.36]I don't know what's over here, though.
[23:22.45]Wait another few minutes, maybe.
[23:26.05]Bad circulation.
[23:26.95]Ah, fuck.
[23:28.01]I didn't think you could miss them.
[23:28.91]That was worth a lot.
[23:29.69]Alright, here we go.
[23:31.80]This is where it's going to start to get... Yeah, I ate a lot of chicken.
[23:33.80]I ate a lot of turkey.
[23:34.52]This is possible.
[23:38.75]Got it!
[23:40.23]See, my intuition's just, like, gravitated over to the disease I have.
[23:43.83]Like, this is IBS.
[23:45.53]Inflammatory bowel disease.
[23:47.15]Inflammation of the lining of your digestive tract, which can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, and even malnutrition.
[23:51.89]Diarrhea, Crohn's disease, colitis.
[23:53.90]There it is.
[23:56.04]Almost there.
[23:57.26]Why am I excited about this?
[23:59.56]I shouldn't be excited about this.
[24:00.94]Why am I like, oh, there it is!
[24:02.22]Okay, cool!
[24:08.80]You see, here's like the bad part about this that I don't like.
[24:13.20]At the end of this game right now, I die.
[24:15.44]Like that's not, I don't, that's not cool.
[24:17.22]What?
[24:19.86]I don't want that to be a thing.
[24:25.52]Okay, we go.
[24:26.18]Go to the doctor for the first time.
[24:28.12]Recovery progress will start.
[24:30.24]This is like, I'm like reliving some pretty like bad memories right now.
[24:35.60]I'm going to get an exam- I remember when I had to do this, I had to shit in a jar.
[24:39.54]It was weird.
[24:41.06]And now, here we go.
[24:43.04]Get- Here it is.
[24:47.64]Oh no, this is the end game.
[24:48.98]I don't like thi- I don't like this.
[24:53.49]This just got way too real.
[24:56.05]Way too quickly.
[24:57.11]Alright, anyways, let's continue to- Dude, this is getting dark.
[25:12.44]Why am I doing this to myself?
[25:18.28]At first, it was like an interesting idea.
[25:19.66]Oh, a guy could do like my diseases.
[25:21.60]I'm like, I'm looking into a fucked up crystal ball right now.
[25:24.12]I don't like this.
[25:31.97]Alright, here we go.
[25:34.51]I guess the goal, I'm being traded for that, but not for this.
[25:39.95]Jesus Christ.
[25:42.96]So what happens when this fails?
[25:51.67]Oh, finally getting traded for my baldness.
[25:56.29]Forget about the baldness though.
[26:03.62]Chat is the cure.
[26:04.56]Alright, let's go.
[26:05.60]What else we got?
[26:06.46]Let's go to immune.
[26:09.54]What about other male problems?
[26:12.30]No, I don't want any more of those.
[26:13.84]This is freaking me out.
[26:18.10]This is freaking me out.
[26:20.84]Satan is watching right now and he's like taking notes.
[26:23.95]Oh, so that's what he wants, huh?
[26:26.11]Of course.
[26:27.19]I'll write it down in my Satan journal.
[26:35.52]Jeremy suffers from chronic fatigue.
[26:39.02]I'm doing a panel.
[26:43.98]Oh, I can upgrade, right?
[26:45.12]Yeah.
[26:46.02]No, not yet.
[26:46.58]Must evolve five risk factors.
[26:53.37]Give me, give me, give me.
[26:59.67]Ultrasounds.
[27:02.53]It's like going down.
[27:03.48]I might as well.
[27:04.36]Let's see.
[27:04.66]What do we got?
[27:05.12]Bones.
[27:06.22]Arthritis.
[27:07.02]Osteoporosis.
[27:08.06]No.
[27:10.98]Kidney.
[27:11.44]Urinary incontinence.
[27:12.76]I absolutely have this.
[27:16.43]I don't think I have a UTI, but I definitely pee way too much.
[27:18.65]I don't know why that would... Why would having to pee a lot kill you?
[27:38.00]Ouch, that was loud.
[27:42.63]I pee way too loudly.
[27:45.34]Can I upgrade yet?
[27:45.92]No.
[27:45.98]It's going down.
[27:50.86]Emergency room.
[27:51.50]In critical condition, Jeremy has been admitted to the emergency room.
[27:54.32]In critical condition, the doctors are now intensifying their efforts to save Jeremy.
[27:58.92]What's next?
[27:59.38]Doctors will diagnose and treat diseases faster.
[28:01.22]Recovery progress will increase.
[28:02.64]I don't like this.
[28:07.62]This is not... I don't like this.
[28:13.20]Save him.
[28:14.28]Why did we choose me?
[28:15.86]And why did we do death first?
[28:20.79]Uh, no, I got cysts.
[28:28.61]18%.
[28:30.45]Why do you keep saying we?
[28:31.65]Oh my god.
[28:34.67]This is supposed to be a relaxing just hangout stream.
[28:42.92]And now I'm just, I'm like fucking scared now.
[28:49.16]I'm getting treatment!
[28:49.78]Alright, what about, let's go back to the roadmap.
[29:00.65]I just got electrocuted.
[29:04.57]I'm almost at 0% digestive tract.
[29:10.29]I'm at 60, I'm still at a little D plus health.
[29:14.05]I'm still okay.
[29:17.23]I think I'm gonna be fine.
[29:19.95]Why- Jerma has had a gastric bypass.
[29:26.91]Why did- They- I didn't go in for splat- Like, I didn't go in for gastric bypass, I'm dying here!
[29:37.48]Who fucked up the charts?!
[29:41.10]That's wrong!
[29:44.55]Jerm is out of the emergency room.
[29:45.89]Alright, I'm out of the emergency room.
[29:50.79]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[29:52.01]I'm not gonna do this yet.
[29:55.19]Let's go back here.
[29:58.96]We got a digestive nervous system.
[30:00.42]Let's go to the nervous system, right?
[30:02.48]Muscular?
[30:03.34]Bananas?
[30:03.84]I hate bananas.
[30:09.92]muscle cramps and then we'll go into uh no I don't want to do that yet let's go with this what's this okay alright let's I'm I'm gonna get real fat here now my potassium levels bananas are gross I'm just kidding I love bananas I eat them all the time I eat bananas like every day alright fat fat really fat
[30:40.65]Obese.
[30:51.56]Okay.
[30:53.22]Upgrade.
[30:54.16]I need six points.
[30:58.51]I have eaten two cheeseburgers in one sitting before plenty of times, so.
[31:05.15]I love bananas.
[31:06.35]Don't listen to anything I ever say.
[31:07.47]Alright, we got more harvesting power.
[31:12.00]We can actually, we're level 3, we can, I'm gonna do that again.
[31:20.99]Again, 90, 10.
[31:21.33]What was that?
[31:26.77]Okay, my kidney, my urinary incontinence is getting cured.
[31:31.26]What happened?
[31:31.92]What happened to my, what happened?
[31:34.54]I just had diarrhea out of my, the side of my stomach and it was red.
[31:43.18]What was that?
[31:43.70]Okay.
[31:46.72]Now we're just going to get resources every... I think every minute here, right?
[31:51.99]What's next on the biome map?
[31:54.55]I'm getting cured for this.
[31:56.87]Let's do a kidney failure.
[32:01.05]Skeletal, though.
[32:01.57]I should do a skateboarding accident and break my leg or something, right?
[32:05.35]Let me look at skeletal.
[32:11.96]Where is Skeletor?
[32:14.58]Uh... Rickets.
[32:17.56]Leukemia.
[32:18.16]Osteoporosis.
[32:20.57]Osteoporosis.
[32:21.21]I'm getting old, right?
[32:22.01]Here we go.
[32:22.57]Osteoporosis right into, uh... Whatever this is.
[32:25.65]Bone interferes with your body's normal recycling process.
[32:28.13]Okay, we're gonna do that next.
[32:29.25]Oh, shit.
[32:32.47]I'm almost fully recovered.
[32:35.91]I'm at 62% recovery here.
[32:45.75]I got +2 +2.
[32:48.86]I'm pretty sleepy.
[32:52.92]What's next?
[32:53.44]We got kidneys, right?
[32:55.14]We're gonna do this?
[32:56.04]18.
[32:56.46]I'm gonna hold on.
[32:59.38]I want to do like two at the same time.
[33:05.61]We need to work on like other problems here, like circulatory.
[33:09.35]The skeletal and circulatory get a little too high for my, you know, my liking.
[33:16.22]Here we go.
[33:16.52]Let's spend some of these.
[33:19.62]So let's go back over here.
[33:21.10]Bingo.
[33:22.95]Now let's do... What was this one?
[33:25.75]18?
[33:26.23]No, the kidneys are... Um... No, what's this one?
[33:33.89]21.
[33:34.73]Some more risk factors.
[33:37.34]Yeah, sitting down all the time.
[33:38.50]Am I pissing into a drinking fountain?
[33:44.14]What?
[33:44.28]What?
[33:46.55]Holy shit.
[33:48.29]Oh, no.
[33:48.61]Workaholic.
[33:49.29]A workaholic is a person who is addicted to work.
[33:53.46]Interesting.
[33:56.10]I'm dropping here.
[34:01.90]Collect some of that.
[34:03.58]Back in the emergency room.
[34:04.39]This is my chance.
[34:08.91]Here's the opportunity.
[34:13.51]I'm treating my insomnia in the emergency room.
[34:19.97]Alright, what do we want to do here?
[34:24.59]Bingo.
[34:24.75]Now I'm in trouble.
[34:27.33]51%, 52%.
[34:27.39]What about bones?
[34:48.49]This game's giving me anxiety.
[34:52.21]Yeah, it is.
[34:54.47]Let's go with bronchitis.
[34:59.60]Into chronic bronchitis.
[35:07.14]I'm at half health.
[35:11.53]Come on, get them both.
[35:14.89]Add another one to the list then.
[35:17.57]God.
[35:19.08]We had fully upgraded?
[35:19.92]Yeah.
[35:22.38]Almost at 80%.
[35:22.78]Hold on.
[35:23.28]No, no, no.
[35:23.66]I'm going to be alright.
[35:26.58]Not if I have anything to say about it.
[35:27.64]Okay, we've got deep veins.
[35:37.57]I'm working against the clock here.
[35:43.07]Come on.
[35:49.51]Stress.
[35:50.90]Nervous breakdown.
[35:51.64]I should have done that first.
[35:57.16]I would have a nervous breakdown if I figured all this shit out about myself.
[36:03.44]He's gonna fully recover from all the diseases.
[36:06.90]Oh god.
[36:07.40]I'm getting there.
[36:09.09]It still might happen.
[36:18.30]Recovery?
[36:18.74]Can I, like, delete this?
[36:22.20]Oh, shit.
[36:22.84]Okay.
[36:23.16]Alright, put the nurses on strike.
[36:27.04]Okay.
[36:33.18]Nurses in the hospital are on strike now.
[36:39.96]They're still on strike.
[36:41.12]Keep them on strike!
[36:48.17]What else we got?
[36:49.03]Heart.
[36:50.35]These are locked.
[36:50.99]These are cured.
[36:54.27]Okay, I'm going to have an aneurysm.
[36:56.87]I have one of those, like, on stream.
[37:00.80]Alright, the nurse is back in.
[37:06.18]Oh, boy!
[37:06.68]That one was cured completely.
[37:10.28]Wait, put him on strike again.
[37:11.61]No, the doctors are going to go on strike.
[37:16.79]I think I'm going to be cured here.
[37:19.15]Alright, well we gotta remove that for the next time.
[37:24.27]I don't think I'm gonna be... I think I'm gonna be done here.
[37:26.88]Junk food addict.
[37:31.28]Nervous breakdown.
[37:32.36]Dementia.
[37:34.22]Yeah, I'm gonna get cured.
[37:39.59]Kidney trans... Jeremy has had a kidney transplant.
[37:41.57]Kidney transplantation is the organ transplant of a kidney into a patient with end-stage renal disease.
[37:45.81]What's next?
[37:46.23]Renal system health increased.
[37:49.51]So I'm going to live.
[37:54.59]Unless something crazy happens.
[37:57.73]I'll put the doctors on strike and see if that does anything.
[38:03.40]Come on, let's go, let's go!
[38:04.24]Alright, doctors are going on strike.
[38:10.62]Nothing is going to happen for a month.
[38:14.52]I'm at 36.
[38:20.13]Come on.
[38:21.64]Don't got much time here.
[38:22.40]Come on.
[38:26.70]Why am I so actively ready for this?
[38:29.44]Like, oh yeah, I can't wait.
[38:31.60]Come on, hurry up.
[38:34.66]Let's do this.
[38:35.42]What's my lungs at?
[38:36.36]I need circulatory.
[38:38.46]We gotta bring that down.
[38:44.34]Circulatory system.
[38:46.00]What about all the mail problems?
[38:50.16]More of these groin pain, nausea, bruising, swelling.
[38:57.20]Let's go back.
[38:59.66]Where's my circulatory?
[39:00.91]No, this is not circulatory.
[39:06.15]What is sensitivity?
[39:06.91]Where's my circulation?
[39:08.65]This is lungs, brain, kidneys, muscular.
[39:13.05]Where is circulation?
[39:21.52]Is this circulation?
[39:22.28]This is like, oh, okay.
[39:23.00]They have brain aneurysm.
[39:32.73]They haven't made very much progress.
[39:35.07]Oh, they did.
[39:35.41]It's going to be close.
[39:38.05]No, I'm fine.
[39:40.97]You lose.
[39:41.53]Stage one.
[39:42.31]Jeremy has been stabilized and will live to see another day.
[39:46.55]Patient Jeremy has been stabilized after 11 months of medical treatments.
[39:49.87]The precise diagnosis and treatment of Jeremy's colon cancer slowed down the digestive system collapse, thus providing more time to complete prognosis.
[39:58.21]As a last resort, gastric bypass was performed on Jeremy and proven to be successful.
[40:03.28]I'm going to screen cap this.
[40:12.02]This could be something that happens to me later on.
[40:16.19]Alright, now that we have a basic understanding of how the game works, let's try it again.
[40:26.46]Terminate me?
[40:26.92]Alright, we're gonna start with just some general stuff.
[40:34.35]Oops, I didn't mean to do that.
[40:43.04]Let's just bank on some things for a little while.
[40:45.68]Because I don't want no recovery yet.
[40:48.02]Let's just bank some viruses here, get some points.
[40:53.04]Don't start spending money until we need to.
[41:06.41]Do the immune system first.
[41:07.97]Oh yeah, do the immune system first.
[41:09.81]I have an idea.
[41:13.29]So this really is just play gank, but on one guy.
[41:17.67]Interesting concept.
[41:21.77]Okay.
[41:22.20]Randomly evolved.
[41:23.52]Jeremy is scared of going to the doctor.
[41:28.82]Uh, nosocomophobia is defined as a fear of hospitals and clinics.
[41:33.34]Victim will be less likely to go to the doctor.
[41:37.02]I didn't even do anything.
[41:42.45]Alright, well, thanks for the freebie.
[41:47.11]My digestive system is already in trouble.
[41:49.17]Why?
[41:49.71]Nothing happened.
[41:51.55]That's not good.
[41:52.13]Alright, we got points now.
[41:55.39]Let's spend these.
[41:55.99]Let's get to 30 maybe and then call it a day.
[42:01.72]Alright.
[42:02.48]Let's do... Let's start with the... Start with the circulatory system first.
[42:08.50]Let's start with... We'll go this way.
[42:13.09]blood clots into this thrombosis.
[42:18.69]Directly into an embolism.
[42:22.45]This all happened in 10 seconds.
[42:28.03]I got this all immediately.
[42:29.19]Now let's wait, let's go, hold on.
[42:31.71]While we have a second here.
[42:36.45]I'm gonna do some stuff to my guy.
[42:42.76]Let's go to risk factors here.
[42:45.54]I'm allergic to a lot of shit.
[42:49.68]Like peanut butter.
[42:53.67]Eggs.
[42:55.69]Malnutrition.
[42:56.21]Let's make it so I'm not eating well either.
[42:58.53]One more point.
[43:04.01]Give him the common cold.
[43:06.55]You probably can do that.
[43:11.66]Because these have to be taken into consideration too.
[43:14.39]Country said the patient is far from the hospital.
[43:17.41]We'll do that.
[43:22.97]More malnutrition is fine.
[43:24.38]Then I'll make myself pretty fat.
[43:31.88]I'm already at 90% health without even going to the doctor, so that's good.
[43:41.02]barn alright what are we level one level two still haven't gone to the doctor probably should after that that's a lot of points alright let's take a look I don't eat well uh dehydration there's a joke here that you guys are gonna make
[44:09.69]Boost all diseases in the following categories.
[44:11.65]Renal and muscular.
[44:12.53]Let's go do some renal problems now.
[44:19.01]That's funny how there's animations for most of these things.
[44:24.57]Now let's do some kidney stuff.
[44:29.73]This game's making me uncomfortable.
[44:34.31]I'm sorry.
[44:35.27]I'm sorry this is like the game that we're watching.
[44:37.78]You're watching.
[44:38.34]We're watching.
[44:40.84]I saw it on Steam and it looked interesting.
[44:42.46]I'm sorry if it's causing you anxiety.
[44:44.66]Alright, let's go to Renal.
[44:52.24]That's not Renal.
[44:55.22]Renal is the little lungs.
[44:56.30]Let's go here.
[45:00.30]Alright.
[45:08.29]I'm just training from med school.
[45:09.71]After this, we're going to go to the wife.
[45:12.45]We're going to flip it around.
[45:13.77]Because there's another game mode.
[45:15.41]Save the patient.
[45:24.09]Can't control bladder.
[45:25.07]No, not anymore.
[45:25.89]Alright, I'm going to the doctor for the first time.
[45:31.91]Let's make it happen here.
[45:33.10]So...
[45:34.83]Let's get to 16 and just have all this awful shit, right?
[45:37.45]Like, all these things that I can't... Just to make it so it slows down.
[45:45.87]No, actually, that's probably better than the other one.
[45:50.72]I wonder what playing the doctor is like.
[45:56.20]Risk factors.
[45:57.18]Alright, we got... Um...
[46:02.71]I mean, this is terrible.
[46:03.71]Let's just pretend that I'm smoking.
[46:06.24]And I'm like a big drinker.
[46:17.38]You go on striking stuff.
[46:20.48]Speaking of which, let's do one of these.
[46:23.66]Bad doctors.
[46:24.82]Yeah, I'm going here for the first time.
[46:27.50]Let's get some bad doctors in here.
[46:33.87]Yeah, don't smoke.
[46:35.75]Don't smoke.
[46:37.59]Don't do it.
[46:41.37]You'll end up as a see-through guy.
[46:46.07]Bad doctors.
[46:47.71]Everything takes much longer.
[46:49.51]Bad diagnosis, bad doctors, part two.
[46:52.94]Alright, now let's work on... Let's make me have a bunch of sex, because that's the joke, right?
[47:01.91]Doctors in Jeremy's hospital are too busy.
[47:03.83]What are we, level 2 yet?
[47:12.75]No.
[47:17.06]Okay, here we go.
[47:22.96]Let's do it.
[47:24.24]Risk factors.
[47:24.96]I'm more likely to have unprotected sex.
[47:30.72]Are they gonna do some weird animation for that?
[47:33.64]No.
[47:42.78]Let's slow this down again.
[47:50.65]No.
[47:51.05]Let's keep going with it.
[47:52.35]Okay, I gotta get this going here.
[47:54.55]I need 15.
[47:56.71]My skeletal system's great.
[47:57.97]Let's fuck with that for a minute here.
[47:59.21]Hold on.
[48:02.17]Can't do it.
[48:04.55]Shit.
[48:07.63]Virus.
[48:15.08]Okay, here we go.
[48:16.76]Are we at 14?
[48:17.98]Let's just do, because they're still working on that.
[48:19.56]Let's just do something else in a different spot.
[48:25.52]Put a picture of my face on the patient.
[48:30.55]No, it was already so real.
[48:32.55]I don't want to make it even more real.
[48:36.29]Okay, this is already being cured.
[48:37.99]Let's go to a different spot.
[48:39.31]Let's go to the skeletal system because it was just too good.
[48:48.80]This is locked.
[48:49.64]I can't do this one.
[48:51.10]I need to be over 60 years old.
[48:52.30]Okay.
[48:52.48]What does it take to be over 60?
[48:54.93]Okay.
[48:59.96]Put my face cam on this guy.
[49:02.12]Oh my god.
[49:03.94]Hold on.
[49:06.80]Can I pause the game?
[49:08.07]Is there a pause game?
[49:09.95]Technically there is.
[49:10.61]Okay.
[49:12.95]You want to do that?
[49:14.09]Hold on.
[49:21.43]There.
[49:25.08]Let me just get this.
[49:25.68]Let me get it right.
[49:39.74]This is not even going to be worth it.
[49:50.51]I got to pull this up a little.
[50:06.47]A little higher.
[50:10.42]There, that's better.
[50:12.60]Okay.
[50:13.86]Ow!
[50:16.96]I'm sorry, that was loud.
[50:18.48]That was really loud.
[50:19.34]Uh, let's do bronchitis.
[50:30.10]Jeremy is about to have unprotected sexual relations.
[50:32.54]Jeremy is about to have unprotected sex.
[50:34.00]You have a chance to spin the wheel of STDs.
[50:39.03]Somebody gave $50, but what does this mean?
[50:44.43]What's going on here?
[50:47.21]Spin the wheel?
[50:48.59]Hold on, I gotta move myself out of the way.
[50:52.84]Unprotected sex roulette!
[50:55.04]Click and drag wheel to spin.
[50:58.54]Are you serious?
[51:15.86]Okay.
[51:18.32]Oh God.
[51:18.90]I was gonna just take off my shirt to make this more realistic.
[51:27.10]What am I thinking?
[51:27.90]I need four.
[51:30.18]Am I in the right spot?
[51:39.35]So what else do we need to do to me?
[51:40.57]70% fail, okay, so far so good.
[51:47.90]Don't rub your eyes.
[51:49.34]Oh my god.
[51:56.61]I was not prepared for that.
[51:59.65]Upgrade, upgrade.
[52:00.77]We're doing both in a row.
[52:01.75]Now we gotta start to go into gear here.
[52:03.99]We gotta get into full-fashioned murder mode.
[52:10.54]Tired.
[52:10.96]Alright, we need... Nervous system has to go down.
[52:15.82]I'm about to do it again!
[52:18.74]What the fuck?
[52:20.14]Stop having unprotected sex.
[52:21.70]I'm gonna have another STD.
[52:27.14]Thank you.
[52:27.66]Oh, I got them both.
[52:33.56]I got Tweedledee and Tweedledum now.
[52:35.06]That's great.
[52:40.45]What's wrong with my nervous system and immune system?
[52:49.71]Alright.
[52:50.31]Nervous System.
[52:51.73]Let's go to the Nervous System.
[52:54.23]We need to do something here.
[52:55.19]Chronic Stress.
[52:57.13]Into a Nervous Breakdown, which is 5.
[52:58.53]Remember that?
[52:59.15]5.
[52:59.25]We need to get 5.
[53:01.87]Not at the right requirements yet.
[53:05.90]I couldn't go that way.
[53:06.76]What was that for?
[53:08.86]Nervous Breakdown.
[53:12.36]Into a Burnout or Dementia.
[53:14.64]We're definitely doing Dementia.
[53:15.46]That's going to take much longer.
[53:24.56]I'm way worse off than I was last time.
[53:26.76]Let's actually, I'm gonna go to the medical field thing.
[53:31.32]Let's go to the recovery phase.
[53:34.78]We need more bad doctors.
[53:36.02]All treatments are less effective.
[53:37.24]Let's just get that out of the way.
[53:49.34]I'm probably going to be the one where I die.
[53:50.90]Because, I mean, just look at it.
[53:53.40]I'm already at 59%.
[53:53.98]I've got to bank points for when the emergency room eventually does happen here.
[54:00.22]Jeremy's drinking three liters of water a day.
[54:02.18]Isn't that a bad... Jeremy's systems are failing.
[54:08.08]That's not Jeremy.
[54:08.65]It's Jeremy.
[54:09.91]Increase failure rate by terminating other systems.
[54:11.97]Each failed system will exponentially damage other systems.
[54:15.31]So my lungs are gone.
[54:17.59]Now I'm going to the emergency room.
[54:18.70]Okay, diagnosis.
[54:19.34]Here we go.
[54:19.72]No, we don't have time for that yet.
[54:24.80]What do we got?
[54:25.26]I need another system here.
[54:30.26]Kidneys?
[54:31.56]Yeah, let's go this way.
[54:32.24]Kidney failure.
[54:36.85]Got it.
[54:38.61]Diseases, kidney failure.
[54:41.11]And then we'll go into chronic kidney failure.
[54:43.01]Fifteen.
[54:45.60]I'm only at 21% cured.
[54:49.32]So, I think I'm gonna be alright.
[54:50.74]I'm gonna be alright.
[54:51.44]No, I'm not gonna be alright.
[54:52.32]That's the whole point.
[54:58.27]Come on.
[55:00.65]Come on, hurry up!
[55:03.37]Hurry up!
[55:05.83]Jesus!
[55:11.50]Take it out.
[55:12.46]What was it?
[55:12.76]12 or 15?
[55:15.91]15.
[55:16.83]I should get it right here.
[55:17.43]They're not going to save me in time.
[55:22.05]It's not going to happen.
[55:27.56]No.
[55:27.84]Right here?
[55:29.78]Kidney failure.
[55:30.38]There it is.
[55:32.58]That one's going down.
[55:37.88]Alright.
[55:38.16]I need 10 points.
[55:40.04]So now we're going to go back to digestive here.
[55:49.70]So what happens when I lose?
[55:50.68]Oh, win.
[55:51.97]You win by losing.
[55:55.69]It doesn't match up half the time.
[55:56.97]Alright, 12.
[56:00.43]Let's go to Digestive.
[56:04.17]This is the highest one I got.
[56:06.27]Let's go with Constipation into Hemorrhoids into Irritable Bowel.
[56:16.52]In one year this all happened.
[56:19.38]That's a lot.
[56:20.28]That's a lot.
[56:24.49]Randomly evolved bad doctors.
[56:27.37]All treatments are 50% less effective.
[56:29.15]Well, now I'm guaranteed to win.
[56:30.81]So that's fine.
[56:37.50]Let's go with dementia.
[56:40.90]Jeremy's going crazy.
[56:42.12]27 versus 29.
[56:46.62]Yeah, this is it.
[56:50.93]I wonder if I'll have sex one last time.
[56:53.19]You know, before I... Kidney transplant.
[56:55.45]I just had a kidney transplant.
[56:57.86]Got some more increased health.
[56:58.88]It's okay.
[57:02.50]What's your final request?
[57:05.14]I want to have sex one more time!
[57:07.78]And give me another disease!
[57:09.22]Uh-oh.
[57:10.05]What's that?
[57:11.95]Who's doing a Xerox right now?
[57:17.17]How about just here?
[57:21.12]Let's turn the bag... I don't think I'm going to need it.
[57:26.29]I'll just keep doing the... We'll do Irritable Bowel.
[57:29.17]20% health.
[57:42.32]Alright.
[57:42.82]Get Irritable... Allergy test being performed.
[57:44.94]That's not going to do much.
[57:48.50]Because here we go.
[57:49.18]Bingo.
[57:49.64]Bingo.
[57:51.79]Really hard stools.
[57:56.39]The music, I love the music here.
[58:03.14]You know, part of me thought it would be, like, funny if I turned off the stream when I, like, when it's over, but I'm not gonna do that.
[58:11.73]Because we've only been streaming for, like, an hour.
[58:14.57]I mean, maybe if it had been, like, three hours at this point...
[58:20.87]Let's just do that now.
[58:22.05]It's over.
[58:22.41]Here we go.
[58:25.31]I'm about to go down.
[58:34.24]5%.
[58:34.36]Dark whispers whispering to me.
[58:36.42]1%.
[58:37.30]Here we go.
[58:38.12]Time.
[58:41.37]You won.
[58:47.18]Jeremy died in 321 days.
[58:49.30]Bronchitis caused Jeremy's respiratory system to collapse first, which then led to his renal system to collapse.
[58:54.89]Kidney transpilation was performed on Jeremy as the last resort, but without success.
[58:59.44]Time of death, Wednesday, January 23rd, 2019 at 7.43 p.m.
[59:11.91]I don't like this.
[59:12.81]Okay, I'm not even kidding.
[59:14.27]On January 23rd, I'm gonna, like, Final Destination movie my house.
[59:20.01]I'm serious.
[59:21.35]I just fucked myself.
[59:23.09]I'm gonna board up the windows.
[59:24.75]I'm gonna only drink green juice from now until January 23rd, 2019 at 743.
[59:33.10]I ain't going on any trips.
[59:34.96]I ain't taking any weird new supplements.
[59:37.24]I ain't gonna do anything bad.
[59:38.46]I'm gonna be in my house on January 23rd
[59:41.59]I'm gonna just watch a bunch of TV, and I'm gonna sit there, and I'm gonna just, I'm gonna, like, I'm gonna do some light exercises.
[59:46.39]No, I'm not gonna do that at all.
[59:47.27]I'm gonna just lie in bed.
[59:48.11]No, I'm not.
[59:48.81]I'm gonna... I'm gonna go to church on that day.
[59:56.08]January 23rd.
[59:56.60]Why does it have to be the 23rd?
[59:59.02]Like, the Satan day.
[60:01.38]The day of fucking Satan, you're gonna, like, make me have to do that?
[60:05.74]All it needs is to be fucking 3 a.m., and I would definitely die.
[60:22.06]Let's check out the other mode.
[60:24.26]Raced against an AI opponent.
[60:25.76]Well, not gonna do that yet.
[60:29.33]I wanna go do the other one.
[60:30.61]Let's just see what it's like to do the other one.
[60:32.55]Choose life.
[60:33.77]Heroically save your patient before it's too late.
[60:36.73]Start life tutorial.
[60:38.19]Let's figure it out.
[60:47.27]Welcome to the Bio Inc.
[60:48.07]life tutorial.
[60:48.69]We will quickly teach you how to basic so you can cure your first patient.
[60:53.18]Pretty much, this is your victim's health.
[60:56.13]Status of his systems.
[60:57.27]Yeah, this is your patient.
[60:58.19]Blood cells and proteins will spawn here.
[61:00.55]Harvesting them will enable you to earn and spend bio points to diagnose and treat diseases.
[61:05.23]Let's harvest resources.
[61:09.05]So... Okay, they turn into little pills this time.
[61:14.16]Same deal, I guess.
[61:16.96]So what's the difference?
[61:17.68]You just work backwards?
[61:26.26]Mm-hmm.
[61:32.25]Yeah, why is it... It should be patient.
[61:35.17]Victim?
[61:37.61]That makes it sound like you're gonna get rid of him.
[61:39.71]You know, when the victim comes in.
[61:42.64]Biomap.
[61:44.20]Biomap is where you can diagnose and treat diseases, improve patient lifestyles, and more.
[61:47.30]This is how many bio points you have.
[61:51.98]These buttons enable navigation between different cast- SOMEBODY GAVE 50 BUCKS EARLIER TOO!
[61:55.50]Hold on a second.
[61:56.08]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[62:36.67]You're pretty late.
[62:37.22]What's the game about?
[62:37.88]Okay, I'm going to explain this game in less than five seconds.
[62:44.40]Okay?
[62:46.54]So, time me.
[62:49.87]You know how in Family Feud, when I'm done with the first sentence?
[62:55.57]The price is right.
[62:57.98]When I'm done with the last word of the sentence, start the timer.
[63:01.94]So start the timer when I'm done with the last word of the first sentence.
[63:07.38]This is Plague Inc., but with one person only.
[63:12.27]No, that's it.
[63:12.97]That's the whole thing.
[63:13.85]You don't need to start the timer.
[63:14.75]Stop it.
[63:17.38]These buttons enable navigation between different categories.
[63:19.14]Yes, they do.
[63:19.64]Okay.
[63:20.12]This is your patient's symptoms.
[63:23.54]Clicking a symptom will highlight potential diseases.
[63:26.44]Try it out.
[63:26.86]Click on the symptoms.
[63:27.88]Sore throat.
[63:30.48]Cough.
[63:31.48]Fever.
[63:33.12]Good.
[63:33.36]Now click on the system that you think the symptoms or diseases are originating from.
[63:37.33]Systems of health and impact are meaningful hints.
[63:42.07]Find the affected body system.
[63:43.69]Alright.
[63:43.97]Cough.
[63:44.39]Sore throat.
[63:45.97]and a fever.
[63:47.67]I mean, it's going to be here.
[63:50.51]Perfect.
[63:50.77]You're a natural born doctor.
[63:51.79]Okay, now let's try to identify which disease is causing the symptoms.
[63:55.74]Click the cough symptom.
[63:58.04]These are the potential diseases for the cough symptom.
[64:02.16]You need to perform diagnostic tests to confirm the presence of a disease.
[64:05.34]Choose a test from the list below.
[64:08.25]Stethoscope exam.

[64:41.86]new diseases found bronchitis and flu treatments now that you have this is much more complicated than just give guy puke disease now that you have diagnosed diseases you must treat them click the bronchitis disease node click the antibiotics treatment seven days
[65:04.54]Antibiotics, also called antibacterials, are a type of antimicrobial drug used in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections.

[67:19.88]Test complete.
[67:21.38]So what could be causing the fever?
[67:22.64]I'm going to assume if you have these other two illnesses, it's probably this.

[87:37.94]Her brain is not here anymore, but it might come back.
[87:43.68]Alright, how much was the brain transplant?
[87:50.51]Okay, I need 14.
[87:54.46]I can get it back.
[87:55.06]Just need 14 here.
[88:04.42]14.
[88:05.34]Her muscles are... Oh, no.

[88:11.47]One thing at a time.
[88:14.45]Shit, come on.
[88:16.31]How did it go so wrong?
[88:17.31]She just had the flu.
[88:20.32]I misdiagnosed the flu like four times, but... Alright, bring it back.
[88:28.71]There it is.
[88:31.33]Receiving an experimental nerve regeneration therapy.
[88:34.29]Nervous system health increased by 20%.
[88:36.33]Alright, now we just have to deal with the muscular.
[88:38.67]Her muscles are gone.
[88:39.61]What do we do now for that?
[88:42.85]I'm gonna do some steroidal therapy.
[88:50.82]Come on.
[88:57.84]Her circulation, oh no.
[89:00.86]Everything's just going to shit now.
[89:07.08]I can't do anything about this.
[89:08.00]It started off... She's dizzy.
[89:12.72]Look at all these.
[89:13.76]That's too late.
[89:14.90]I'm gonna have to replace them.
[89:16.22]I'm gonna have to replace all of her body parts at this point.
[89:20.90]I still need 12.
[89:21.62]She's still at 36%.
[89:35.21]What's left?
[89:39.09]How is she still around?
[89:40.71]This is crazy.

[90:30.01]Ultrasounds.
[90:30.59]There we go.
[90:31.07]Run the ultrasound.
[90:31.79]Let's see if we can cure a couple of these.
[90:34.83]She's lifting weights in surgery.
[90:38.94]What do we got?
[90:39.30]God damn it.
[90:47.08]The sound.
[90:47.54]I'm going to hear this.
[90:48.48]I feel like a microwave has not been stopped.
[90:50.70]It's just my rice is done.
[90:52.53]You know what I mean?
[90:53.03]She's got a lot of these things.

[90:59.46]Prescribe that.
[91:01.08]Prescribe this.
[91:01.80]Let's get these treated.
[91:06.16]Like, this is what happens.
[91:06.91]No, that's not a microwave.
[91:07.57]This is what happens when you microwave popcorn for too long and your house fire alarm goes off.
[91:11.75]Alright, how much more do we got over here?
[91:16.29]This is eight.
[91:20.09]Looking good.

[91:38.24]Her bones are going away.
[91:39.30]What we got here?
[91:41.40]3.
[91:41.48]This is for the nervous breakdown here.
[91:45.48]More.
[91:51.67]More.
[91:55.44]Get some dementia cure here, and then we're going to do another therapy brain session.
[92:04.61]God damn it.
[92:06.35]Somebody take the batteries out of the fire alarm.
[92:09.74]She's dead.
[92:20.19]Oh, Parkinson's disease caused Mary Jane's nervous system to collapse.
[92:23.91]So we didn't get that right.
[92:25.83]I thought she had the flu.
[92:26.75]I thought she had the flu.
[92:33.41]I killed somebody in my internship.
[92:38.25]Okay.
[92:40.20]Let's go back to Guy.
[92:41.10]How about...
[92:53.53]Her immune system was fine.
[92:54.75]You could tell it wasn't a disease.
[92:56.17]Well, I don't know.
[92:57.50]Your immune system's fine when you have the flu.
[93:06.16]You're the guy that all the people complain about that diagnoses everything as the flu.
[93:16.56]I need some... I need motive.
[93:21.63]Your immune system's under attack with the flu.
[93:28.61]I'm not a doctor, okay?
[93:33.52]How about, let's just go with Frank.
[93:40.62]We'll stay on the moderate difficulty, that's fine.
[93:44.76]Alright, let's go with environment here.
[93:47.90]Resource upgrades are 50% cheaper, that's a huge deal.
[93:54.72]Intensive care, lifestyle.
[93:59.42]Diseases, decrease collateral damage of diseases.
[94:06.69]Clicking on a symptom will highlight fewer diseases.
[94:09.23]Let's do this one, that sounds like a plan.
[94:14.98]You have Parkinson's, huh?
[94:16.22]Here's some Tamiflu and bed rest.
[94:20.56]Now I get it, okay, here we go.
[94:21.98]So we've got, let's start it off right.
[94:24.79]Immune system is compromised here a little bit.
[94:27.91]Problems with the nervous system, problems with circulatory system.
[94:29.93]Circulatory system is by far the worst besides nervous system.
[94:35.72]Let's take a look, let's get it started now.
[94:38.12]Nervous system is the most important here.
[94:41.16]We've got chest pain, we've got mood swings, we've got blurred vision, elevated heart rate, mood swings, start here.
[94:51.81]Let's do a psychological evaluation.
[94:56.01]Let's just start with a psychological evaluation.
[94:59.11]And see.
[95:03.80]What is these whispers?
[95:04.84]Why are they here?
[95:12.60]Okay.
[95:14.12]Going good.
[95:15.91]At the same time, let's go lifestyle here.
[95:19.59]I got some points to wait to feel they're gonna have a psychological examination uh let's go with the mediterranean diet make yourself a little bit healthier eat better yeah have a salad every once in a while looking good doctor see
[95:48.12]chronically stressed and having a nervous breakdown.
[95:50.72]Doctor, I'm bleeding.
[95:51.88]What was the relationship like with your father?
[95:55.68]That's funny.
[95:56.18]Somebody in chat is very funny.
[95:57.77]Alright, let's start with some stress therapy here.
[95:59.97]30 days.
[96:01.67]No, we're going to do it with 10 days.
[96:02.73]Let's get a couple more points.
[96:12.22]Here we are.
[96:12.72]Let's get this treated.
[96:15.00]Let's get you on a prescription here, and then let's move on.
[96:17.42]Let's do, this is five points.
[96:22.43]Circulatory, let's take a look at circulation and see how it is.
[96:25.25]Chest pains.
[96:26.85]So chest pains, we'll start with the circulatory system here.
[96:32.41]We could do one of these.
[96:35.05]Blood pressure test, no.
[96:38.62]Okay, we could do an electrocardiograph.
[96:40.64]We're going to try that.
[96:45.34]How much of the unfunny streamer steals chat?
[96:48.44]I just got attributed to somebody in chat.
[96:50.78]That's not stealing.
[96:51.46]That's me attributing to it.
[96:52.48]I'm giving credit at the bottom of the citation on my footnotes of the text of me talking.
[96:58.54]Somebody's dying here, alright?
[96:59.82]Everyone calm down.
[97:06.08]It was sourced.
[97:09.60]Okay, well, I need eight.
[97:14.49]Where's my citation?
[97:21.78]He's a workaholic.
[97:22.70]Stop it.
[97:23.88]Get off the computer.
[97:24.64]There we are.
[97:30.46]Alright.
[97:32.16]So we've got an echocardiogram.
[97:33.36]Run it.
[97:35.22]Ah, turn it off.
[97:37.04]What happened now?
[97:37.76]Oh.
[97:41.07]Imagine being in the doctor's office.
[97:43.40]Let's get you hipped up with that echocardiogram.
[97:45.42]Let's put it on your hair.
[97:46.42]Okay, let's see how that works.
[97:49.66]Get that off!
[97:50.36]Turn it off!
[97:50.74]That's annoying to me!
[97:51.96]And he unplugs it.
[97:54.72]I would be a bad doctor.
[98:00.75]Bingo.
[98:01.01]We have some angia.
[98:03.95]High cholesterol, hypertension, and arrhythmia.
[98:07.21]No heart attack.
[98:10.82]Let's begin the process here.
[98:13.04]I need to upgrade.
[98:13.88]We need to upgrade our biomedical field here.
[98:19.72]More harvesting power.
[98:22.34]Swelling and bruising.
[98:23.24]We've got to deal with the heart here.
[98:26.98]He's still being treated for this.
[98:28.40]He's doing okay.
[98:29.49]We need to focus on the circulatory system now.
[98:32.85]While there's time.
[98:40.01]Come on.
[98:41.43]Quickly.
[98:41.77]Okay, we got seven, four.
[98:46.65]Let's get about some, let's just get some saline in them.
[98:49.41]You know what I'm saying?
[98:55.79]Pick up the donuts.
[98:56.39]There it is.
[99:07.15]Okay, keep it going, circulatory.
[99:09.73]Get these treated.
[99:11.98]So this is a big problem.
[99:14.88]Let's start with this.
[99:15.92]Let's do a little bit of a nitroglyceride treatment.
[99:20.19]Describe it.
[99:21.91]You can't just jump right into the end.
[99:29.43]After we do the circulatory... The nervous system is having a little bit of trouble here too.
[99:32.31]I'm going to have to go in there and find out what's going on.
[99:34.93]Do some more testing.
[99:37.20]Okay.
[99:37.88]That's better.
[99:38.66]Good.
[99:40.66]Still not done.
[99:42.02]We have the last thing to treat in the circulatory system.
[99:48.90]Let's see.
[99:49.12]What is this?
[99:49.46]Seven.
[99:51.48]We need to get this one here.
[99:54.39]We need twelve.
[99:55.73]That's going to be the next one I do.
[99:58.53]So just hang in there.
[100:00.55]Doctor will be with you shortly.
[100:05.79]There it is.
[100:06.15]Come on.
[100:06.79]Give me more points than this.
[100:09.18]Come on.
[100:11.65]There it is.
[100:15.76]Get him on a pacemaker for a little while.
[100:18.76]Good.
[100:19.96]Now we get some blurred vision here.
[100:24.40]Blurred vision.
[100:26.02]It's gonna be up here.
[100:28.79]How about his mood swings?
[100:30.93]Still having mood swings problems.
[100:32.19]Let's take a look.
[100:32.69]What can I do here?
[100:33.33]Is this five?
[100:33.73]Five points?
[100:34.03]Five points.
[100:44.04]Because his brain is starting to get a little bit on the... Wait a minute.
[100:48.10]Lifestyles.
[100:48.70]Hold on.
[100:50.62]We need to get to his circulation.
[100:51.74]That has to be a little bit better.
[100:52.92]Aerobic exercise.
[100:53.88]Let's get him on some small, slight exercise.
[100:58.53]Get him a little bit, you know... Or do some aerobic exercises.
[101:01.25]Not too much.
[101:01.83]Just enough to get some blood flowing.
[101:04.67]You know what I mean?
[101:08.96]That didn't really do anything.
[101:10.70]It was 1%.
[101:12.00]Why did I waste money on that?
[101:17.07]Okay, here we go.
[101:18.69]I'm going to do this now because it has to be done because he is hurting here.
[101:24.79]We've got to stop this.
[101:25.60]We've got to cut this out.
[101:26.76]I don't want to do a heart transplant this early into his... I was going to say presidency.
[101:33.72]That's not correct.
[101:38.57]Okay.
[101:39.75]Almost done with his arrhythmia treatment.
[101:43.55]Good.
[101:45.26]Muscles are fine, we don't have to deal- And he's got no problems with his muscles.
[101:50.13]Paranoia.
[101:50.89]This is- We have- Okay, paranoia.
[101:53.19]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[101:53.95]Easy.
[101:57.00]What just happened?
[101:57.44]What are you doing?
[101:59.86]Did you just take my upgrade?
[102:00.84]Did you just ate my coins?
[102:02.00]Alright, no, I'm fine.
[102:14.64]come on come on what was this one five yeah there we go his paranoia stems from paranoia and fatigue paranoia comes from here debenture let's treat it he's going to be going to the emergency room here in a sec no we're actually we're increasing
[102:44.79]This is not too... Great.
[102:46.53]Perfect.
[102:48.19]Three spitballs.
[102:51.98]Alright, let's get to that paranoia.
[102:56.94]I already know it's dementia.
[102:58.66]So, like, do I really need to... I mean, I guess we have to run the test, right?
[103:04.41]But he also has fatigue, so we're going to do a psychiatric assessment here.
[103:14.56]Let's go to... What else do we got?
[103:16.08]Blurred vision.
[103:17.82]Oh, he might have some mail problems.
[103:19.04]Here we go.
[103:20.30]Stroke.
[103:21.12]Okay.
[103:24.22]We need to do a brain MRI.
[103:25.32]I don't have enough.
[103:36.98]I have to do that MRI.
[103:37.88]He's fighting it.
[103:42.70]Fuck.
[103:44.52]For what, though?
[103:44.92]What's he in the emergency room for?
[103:46.90]It's gotta be his brain.
[103:50.28]That's his brain.
[103:54.46]Okay, he has dementia.
[103:56.68]But hold on a minute.
[103:57.35]Fatigue, elevated heart rate, blurred vision.
[104:00.99]Here we go.
[104:04.87]Major depression.
[104:09.37]I can't do it right now.
[104:11.79]I just did a psychiatric assessment.
[104:13.13]I don't need to do that again.
[104:17.64]I want to take a look at him one more time.
[104:21.26]Leg swelling.
[104:22.48]Elevated heart rate.
[104:23.30]It's back here somewhere.
[104:25.15]Fatigue.
[104:25.63]It could be anything.
[104:26.75]Blurred vision.
[104:27.43]It's up here.
[104:27.93]I need to do a brain MRI that I'm not prepared for yet.
[104:32.55]Alright, get the MRI started.
[104:44.67]Hold on, you know what?
[104:45.37]I'm gonna do this.
[104:47.05]Fuck.
[104:52.86]He could be having a stroke.
[104:54.52]So we need to get this done.
[104:56.86]Run the MRI.
[105:03.74]God damn it, I missed.
[105:04.54]I was like staring over here at dementia.
[105:13.15]It's alright, just hold tight, hold tight, hold tight.
[105:19.25]12.
[105:20.59]Brain MRI.
[105:21.75]Ah!
[105:23.16]So what does he have?
[105:24.76]Blurred vision.
[105:26.68]Shit.
[105:27.00]Fatigue, elevated heart rate.
[105:29.58]What has he got?
[105:31.66]It's not a stroke.
[105:33.38]It's not a brain aneurysm.
[105:34.76]What is it then?
[105:36.56]What is it?
[105:40.74]Is it
[105:42.50]Oh, shit!
[105:43.96]Pee into a cup, quick!
[105:53.83]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[105:55.77]What is it, 14?
[106:00.85]14.
[106:02.85]Give me one more before he dies!
[106:04.84]Come on!
[106:06.38]Give it to me!
[106:08.76]Ooh!
[106:08.84]Okay, he's got it.
[106:09.60]He's got- he's got Alport Syndrome.
[106:12.83]Intensive care.
[106:14.75]Bingo.
[106:16.38]Ladies and gentlemen, and that's how you treat a patient.
[106:19.22]22%.
[106:20.14]Now we're going to treat his Alport syndrome.
[106:25.90]What does it take to do that?
[106:28.38]This causes a ton of problems.
[106:30.90]So we got, we need five.
[106:32.24]That's all it took.
[106:32.80]Let's call me Dr. Greg House.
[106:42.03]I figure it out.
[106:43.01]Sometimes unconventionally, you know.
[106:46.89]But I do figure it out.
[106:48.60]Eventually, that is.
[106:51.26]Wilson, get out of here.
[106:53.58]You're kind of dull and stupid.
[107:00.68]Memium boost.
[107:03.36]Producing more white cells.
[107:07.07]More resources will spawn in the next few days.
[107:08.81]Good.
[107:09.67]He's stable.
[107:10.97]We did it.
[107:14.51]Funny streamer.
[107:16.03]Please.
[107:17.97]If I see haha one more time, I'm deleting my Twitch channel.
[107:22.83]If I see haha one more time in the chat, I am deleting my Twitch channel, deleting my Twitter, deleting my mortgage.
[107:33.61]I'm just gonna go live in a fucking barn.
[107:39.80]I have a lot of points.
[107:40.64]Holy shit.
[107:41.96]He's doing fine, though.
[107:48.02]Don't say it.
[107:51.16]The crowd has spoken.
[107:53.38]You see all this stuff I'm getting?
[107:54.50]This is awesome.
[107:55.24]Alright.
[107:55.76]Let's do some more upgrades.
[108:00.61]Fatigue.
[108:01.39]Elevated heart rate.
[108:04.69]Leg swelling.
[108:05.37]Alright.
[108:05.67]We're going to go with... Let's do some ultrasounds.
[108:11.47]Let's also do one of these.
[108:14.67]We have a lot of points to do it.
[108:15.73]And let's go to lifestyle.
[108:17.39]Let's help him out here.
[108:19.59]Proper hydration.
[108:22.63]No.
[108:25.55]Immune system, nervous system, relaxation therapy.
[108:37.55]Okay, we'll figure out what we can do.
[108:39.99]We're getting close to saving him.
[108:42.53]Muscle weakness and shaking.
[108:47.38]Alright, so he's got some thrombosis.
[108:49.20]He's got some blood clots.
[108:53.16]So muscle weakness can be attributed to over here.
[108:55.26]Another problem, the brain shaking as well.
[108:56.86]He definitely has one.
[108:57.50]Let's get this one started.
[108:59.84]Let's do a brain PET scan.
[109:06.77]Let's come back over here.
[109:07.85]Let's get him some anticoagulants and some clot busters.
[109:16.02]Go back to lifestyles and let's get some light exercise involved in his routine.
[109:21.73]Because we can get some skeletal issues and muscular problems here.
[109:24.69]Fitness enthusiast, let's do that too.
[109:26.71]Let's get healthy.
[109:30.77]He does not have an embolism.
[109:32.79]Okay.
[109:34.80]Good to know.
[109:43.18]Skeletal, there he goes.
[109:44.40]Nice jog.
[109:47.82]And he does have Parkinson's.
[109:49.08]Okay.
[109:49.82]So let's trade it right now before it gets out of hand.
[109:51.72]Because his brain is not doing that great at the moment.
[109:54.96]So I need 13.
[110:02.03]Give him some more blood.
[110:06.94]We gotta take care of that now.
[110:07.80]It's really starting to cause a problem.
[110:08.94]He's gonna go to the emergency room in two seconds.
[110:10.34]There it is.
[110:13.31]That should help a lot.
[110:16.53]Taking care of the blood clots.
[110:19.05]God damn it.
[110:22.33]What's it for?
[110:23.51]It's gonna be for the Parkinson's.
[110:24.63]He'll be fine.
[110:26.64]Just need to give it a minute here.
[110:27.50]I'm already upgraded.
[110:34.99]I gotta look at the other diagnosis map.
[110:37.27]Fatigue.
[110:38.57]Now this is where it could just be anything, so... I'm gonna say it probably has something to do with his brain still.
[110:45.60]Burnout or major depression.
[110:47.38]Let's do a full-on... I got a feeling it's this one.
[110:51.81]Let's do a complete assessment, because that's the last symptom he has.
[111:01.14]Come on!
[111:03.08]I'm gonna have to do another- I gotta go back and do the thing with the brain again.
[111:06.30]We gotta do another, uh... Yeah, we do.
[111:09.06]Intensive care.
[111:12.19]Already did it.
[111:12.95]Fuck.
[111:15.07]Reduce the diagnosis time.
[111:21.77]Better treatments.
[111:24.95]Okay.
[111:27.75]Come on!
[111:29.68]No, he's negative from major depression.
[111:32.66]So what's making him so tired?
[111:33.64]Let's do another evaluation.
[111:41.48]Joint pain.
[111:43.07]That's new.
[111:47.29]Okay, he's burnt out.
[111:51.99]Let's do... Just get him on some antidepressants here.
[111:55.83]Take care of that fatigue.
[111:59.21]this will stop this from happening and he'll be fine and then this might we're getting close to him being completely recovered come on get full fill it up 9.4 percent nine point three percent got it he's almost healthy he's just gonna have to recover a little bit in the there's some joint pain
[112:25.92]Let's just do a little metabolic panel.
[112:27.66]Improve his lifestyle a little bit here.
[112:31.58]Just have him take a couple of drinks, because you're going to be cured here.
[112:37.64]That just scared the shit out of me, I'm not going to lie.
[112:42.16]Frank is drinking alcohol responsibly.
[112:44.58]He's got hemophilia.
[112:48.38]Alright, this will be done, and we will have a completely cured person here in about five seconds.
[112:58.75]Complete.
[113:03.89]He's nervous.
[113:04.33]Yeah, but this has not failed yet.
[113:06.09]There it is.
[113:06.90]Internship.
[113:07.44]He saved Frank in 264 days.
[113:11.66]Patient Frank has been stabilized after eight months of medical treatments.
[113:14.42]The precise diagnosis and treatment of Frank's Alport syndrome slowed down the male's system collapse.
[113:19.82]It was providing more time to complete prognosis.
[113:21.76]This took like 30 minutes for me to figure that out.
[113:25.84]That was not quick.
[113:26.74]It was very long, actually.
[113:31.78]Saved him.
[113:36.84]Alright, here we go.
[113:37.67]Diagnosis MD.
[113:40.41]So give me a second.
[113:41.15]I gotta pee.
[113:42.43]First pee of the night.
[113:43.93]Be right back.
[113:45.92]Just give me a sec.
[113:47.40]See you guys in a moment.
[113:49.18]Be right back.
[116:23.62]It smells so bad in here.
[116:30.67]It's so gross.
[116:36.68]Unbelievable.
[116:43.62]Pee in my room.
[116:44.34]No, I can't wait.
[116:45.06]Oh, yeah.
[116:45.84]Sorry.
[116:46.10]Hold on.
[116:47.22]Those of you that weren't here earlier, we talked about how this room smells really awful because I think an animal died in the wall.
[116:57.98]Something like mouse or some rat or something back here and somewhere in my wall probably died and it just smells like a dead carcass and it's awful.
[117:08.07]I'm going to have to call somebody and they're going to have to cut like a hole in my wall.
[117:11.09]It's not cool.
[117:13.52]Alright, anyways, I gotta take my mind off it.
[117:17.15]Uh, it's not the snake.
[117:19.51]If it was the snake, the snake would have died like eight months ago, whenever I tweeted that.
[117:27.91]This is probably from the storm.
[117:29.09]I would have to guess that over the course of the last... I wanna say... week?
[117:37.63]We had a horrible bunch of wind and rain and snow.
[117:41.37]Some animal probably was like, oh, I'm going to get safe in there.
[117:44.64]And then came in here and ate a bunch of wall insulation and died.
[117:48.44]That's just probably what happened.
[117:49.70]It's terrible.
[117:50.34]And I hate the fact that there's like some dead mouse or something.
[117:54.46]I'm a gentle soul, right?
[117:56.62]Even like the dead mice.
[117:58.34]I don't like that.
[117:59.04]I want them to be safe.
[118:01.90]I don't like it.
[118:08.12]That's just terrible.
[118:11.48]Guys, I don't even, I don't even, I don't kill bugs.
[118:14.42]If a bug is in my house, I get it on my finger and I like let it outside and let it go free.
[118:23.89]I'm a gentle man.
[118:26.25]Alright, well, first of all, let's, do you want to, uh,
[118:37.70]Sure you do.
[118:38.94]What a nice guy.
[118:47.99]Not even mosquitoes.
[118:48.85]Mosquitoes aren't even real.
[118:51.75]Mosquitoes aren't even animals, man.
[118:54.43]There's a difference.
[118:56.65]Hold on.
[118:56.95]This is where I draw the line.
[118:58.57]Mosquitoes?
[119:00.07]Ticks.
[119:01.59]Right?
[119:02.40]A mosquito?
[119:03.28]A tick?
[119:05.02]Those are one in two.
[119:06.84]Kill them.
[119:08.45]smash them you see a tick take the end of a screwdriver and smash the thing I'm a gentle man okay those are insects insects are animals
[119:30.88]We've been looking at medical stuff for the last two hours.
[119:33.08]Insects are animals.
[119:34.15]They have a multi-layer nervosal skeletal system.
[119:37.47]Are insects animals?
[119:41.29]The animal kingdom is first subdivided into groups called phyla.
[119:46.09]Insects have these characteristics, so they belong to phylum.
[119:52.20]There you go.
[119:55.40]Insects and arachnids, highly diversified grouping of all animal invertebrates.
[120:02.42]Excuse me.
[120:05.98]They're not animals.
[120:12.90]Alright, do you guys want me to do healing or hurting?
[120:15.84]What would you guys rather see?
[120:18.47]I think they both have their fun, I think.
[120:22.79]But we've done the first mission of both of them.
[120:24.29]Do you want to see more doctor?
[120:26.65]Do you want to see more...
[120:29.23]hurt the guy.
[120:30.43]Hurt him.
[120:30.95]Pain.
[120:32.09]Hurt.
[120:32.91]Hurting.
[120:34.11]And I'm the one that's like, I'm the gentle soul.
[120:38.06]You guys might need to internalize this for a minute here.
[120:44.60]Stop killing spiders, okay?
[120:46.52]Don't do that.
[120:48.38]Don't ever kill a daddy longlegs.
[120:51.00]Ever.
[120:52.08]Don't ever kill a cellar spider.
[120:55.30]Don't do that.
[121:08.52]I eat like meat.
[121:12.45]Please don't kill any spiders as I eat like a cheeseburger yesterday.
[121:18.05]Doctor, don't kill the spiders.
[121:19.83]Leave the bugs alone.
[121:21.71]I'll take a rack of lamb, please.
[121:23.41]Alright, let's go back to the herding.
[121:31.70]Daddy Longlegs is not a spider?
[121:32.88]Yeah, it's pretty much a crab.
[121:35.56]Yeah, spiders are pretty much crabs.
[121:36.88]We already talked about this.
[121:40.45]Alright, let's do the next mission here.
[121:43.49]Morg, and we're in Death Race.
[121:45.23]Race against an AI opponent.
[121:47.63]Probably going to lose this.
[121:49.52]Let's do... See, this is a non-spider, so it's okay if they die.
[122:02.35]Still need another couple of points here.
[122:06.19]Let's start with two randomly developed diseases.
[122:13.39]What I learned, spiders are crabs.
[122:14.67]They are.
[122:15.03]Spiders are pretty much crabs.
[122:16.60]Lobster, when you eat a lobster, you're eating a crab.
[122:18.38]You're eating a, no, you're eating a spider.
[122:20.08]Spiders and lobsters are crabs.
[122:24.12]Here we go.
[122:26.80]Oh, here we go.
[122:27.16]He's the AI victim.
[122:28.47]That's not fair.
[122:36.15]What are the two random diseases that I already have?
[122:37.85]Because I'm going to build upon them.
[122:40.17]He's already bald.
[122:41.21]That's nothing.
[122:41.85]Okay, let's build on this.
[122:43.73]Heart retention.
[122:45.83]High cholesterol.
[122:46.93]And let's go to risk factors to make him fat.
[122:48.93]Get to six.
[122:49.61]Let's really hammer this.
[122:51.33]Spiders equals lobsters.
[123:04.96]Lobsters equals crabs.
[123:12.28]I'm glad some of you guys think that's funny.
[123:17.16]I wonder for the people that don't watch this stream that often.
[123:21.43]They probably think I am a sicko.
[123:28.51]We get it.
[123:29.71]We get it.
[123:30.23]I like you guys because you guys just get it.
[123:33.87]You know what I mean?
[123:34.37]You guys get it.
[123:35.07]Overweight.
[123:43.00]He's going for musculoskeletal.
[123:44.10]We're going for circulation and stomach.
[123:56.23]I think he was insulting you.
[124:03.52]Max muscle, max fat.
[124:07.04]Oh, I just clicked off the screen.
[124:12.95]Alright, we got... He's risky.
[124:14.81]Let's make him really fat.
[124:17.45]Give him heart disease.
[124:18.29]These are all locked for some reason.
[124:20.39]Let's get that going.
[124:22.13]Nope, not yet.
[124:26.11]He needs to be fat.
[124:28.19]Malnutrition.
[124:28.91]Let's do that.
[124:29.41]And then let's go right into obesity.
[124:37.30]You can speed this up too.
[124:38.70]I'm afraid to do that though.
[124:39.74]How fast does it go?
[124:41.96]How do I turn it off?
[124:43.66]How do I turn it off?
[124:44.20]How do I turn it off?
[124:45.16]It's going too fast.
[124:48.47]Collect it!
[124:48.87]Okay.
[124:52.29]Uh, non-spider.
[124:53.13]What was it about a non-spider?
[124:55.71]What did he get?
[124:56.15]He got a random disease?
[125:02.67]Okay, here we go.
[125:03.23]Diseases.
[125:03.63]Let's get over here.
[125:06.89]That really... That hurts him.
[125:08.15]Okay.
[125:09.19]And let's go with... He's not moving around.
[125:11.57]Circulatory system is going to be in deep shit because he doesn't move around a whole lot.
[125:21.62]He has a spider disease.
[125:22.88]No, he has a non-spider disease.
[125:30.08]I'm going to really focus on circulatory.
[125:32.34]Obesity is next.
[125:38.46]Come on.
[125:41.43]Come on, I'm losing here.
[125:42.41]Obesity is 10, right?
[125:48.87]Can I do anything else here?
[125:50.92]Yeah.
[125:51.94]I might just go right into this.
[125:59.53]Where are my points?
[126:03.64]Quickie losing hair.
[126:04.72]That's bullshit.
[126:05.38]I got such a bad starting disease.
[126:07.02]I wonder what he got for his starting illness.
[126:10.57]Okay, let's do obesity.
[126:16.81]Junk food addict.
[126:17.77]No, let's go right from here to here.
[126:21.46]I'm gonna do arrhythmia immediately.
[126:29.54]Once I get Arrhythmia here, he'll rapidly start to fall off, I think.
[126:33.12]And then we can start to focus on his digestive system.
[126:41.82]Because this is dropping pretty quickly now.
[126:49.17]Speed it up.
[126:51.71]God damn.
[126:55.19]What's with this RNG, man?
[127:02.40]Play the classic Spider-Man theme?
[127:04.06]Why?
[127:09.87]That's it.
[127:10.75]Okay.
[127:11.71]Send him to the morgue.
[127:14.67]And we can give him a heart attack.
[127:19.47]I can upgrade now.
[127:20.81]There we go.
[127:21.17]See, now I'm catching up.
[127:22.16]87.
[127:22.22]I'm going to be going faster than he is now.
[127:39.11]Give him some soy.
[127:45.95]Maybe I should get a... I'm going to tap into respiratory after this.
[127:50.34]Let's go right to respiratory.
[127:52.58]Well, no.
[127:53.04]Muscular?
[127:53.74]No.
[127:53.94]Respiratory.
[127:54.36]I want to start to get multiple factors here.
[127:58.02]Let's go with bronchitis.
[128:03.92]What's this guy at?
[128:04.54]75.
[128:05.80]I'm catching up.
[128:15.73]I needed more than that.
[128:18.65]There we go.
[128:19.75]Critical condition.
[128:21.53]A non-spider has been admitted to the emergency room.
[128:26.06]Keep it going.
[128:26.86]Keep it up.
[128:27.40]We need, uh, let's go to the biomap.
[128:29.42]Recovery, let's do, I can't do any of these.
[128:31.28]It's a raise.
[128:33.38]Uh... Just give him more junk food.
[128:38.68]And let's fuck with his digestive tract now.
[128:44.94]We got diarrhea.
[128:46.68]Constipation.
[128:50.00]Bingo.
[128:50.42]There we go.
[128:50.74]The circulatory system is almost dead.
[128:53.70]System failed.
[128:54.74]Completely.
[128:55.80]Look at it.
[128:56.10]He's not even close.
[129:03.06]Come on.
[129:03.36]Hurry up.
[129:03.60]I need more points.
[129:05.92]Okay.
[129:13.06]Let's get into digestive.
[129:16.70]Uh, let's go with... Let's go with, um... Keep it going.
[129:21.12]Hemorrhoids, and then... Let's give him also risk factors.
[129:25.68]Let's go back.
[129:26.06]We got morbidly obese.
[129:27.52]Get that to 14.
[129:28.50]Morbidly obese.
[129:35.44]This guy's gonna be as big of a house.
[129:37.44]He's lacking potassium.
[129:44.58]Come on, hurry up.
[129:49.96]Awful.
[129:50.38]Everything.
[129:51.88]Bring it down.
[129:52.32]What do you see?
[129:57.28]Is that 47?
[129:58.64]I should rapidly start to decline here.
[130:09.00]That's 10.
[130:09.64]12.
[130:10.60]Fuck.
[130:15.39]Local man gets fat and dies.
[130:16.77]I need to bring down something else.
[130:26.70]Salmonella.
[130:30.82]I think I'm going to lose this.
[130:31.60]There's no doctor recovery.
[130:36.20]He got a better roll than I did.
[130:47.54]Workaholic dehydration.
[130:49.04]I think I lose.
[130:53.12]The only way I can do this is if I take out another one.
[130:54.92]See, he just barely took out one.
[130:56.93]How does he have more than me?
[131:00.89]I spent too much time getting my guy fat, I think, is the problem.
[131:08.67]I played the long con.
[131:14.66]Yeah, alright.
[131:15.92]I can't play the long game here.
[131:16.90]I just have to give him as many diseases as I can.
[131:26.48]Yeah, so that's it.
[131:27.54]I lost.
[131:28.88]Let's retry it.
[131:32.28]Spent too much time on the risk factors.
[131:34.47]Let's just get right into it.
[131:36.41]What did I get for a roll here?
[131:37.53]Alright, that's better.
[131:39.07]I got urinary incontinence and insomnia.
[131:44.09]I wonder if we should go... We'll go right for chronic fatigue.
[131:47.39]And then from there, we're going to go over to urinary tract infection or kidney cysts.
[131:54.07]Which one's cheaper?
[131:55.58]Yeah, they're both gonna go kidney cysts.
[131:58.12]Let's do it.
[131:59.10]Here we go.
[131:59.72]Do it up.
[132:06.67]Planning this guy's demise.
[132:07.85]Alright, we got quickly... No, what's the other one?
[132:15.33]It's eight.
[132:15.73]They're all eight.
[132:17.94]Where are my points?
[132:28.63]Let's go right for kidney cysts.
[132:30.93]And then we're gonna go chronic fatigue.
[132:39.71]Mm-hmm.
[132:42.07]I'm already ahead.
[132:48.10]Can I afford something that was cheap here?
[132:49.60]What about... No, baldness is stupid.
[132:54.96]muscles let's go with yeah muscle aches potassium decreased keep it up let's get to eight I'm not doing ball the ball doesn't do anything it makes them like stressed out for a little while
[133:21.94]That's very loud.
[133:23.90]Here we go, this is to get to 8.
[133:24.72]9, here we go.
[133:26.33]Alright, let's go with... Wait, maybe not.
[133:29.29]Maybe we're gonna go with Chronic Muscle Cramps.
[133:35.63]Then we're gonna move up to Circula- No, I wanna do the Kidney Failure.
[133:38.29]And then we're gonna move to Circulation.
[133:49.36]Bananas.
[133:49.90]Yeah, he needs to eat more bananas.
[133:55.77]Come on.
[134:01.36]There we go.
[134:04.16]Kidney?
[134:04.56]No, what was it?
[134:05.40]It was... I wanted kidney failure.
[134:07.72]Yeah.
[134:08.30]Just get the renal to be all over the place and then we'll go in circulation.
[134:14.10]Come on, please.
[134:15.98]Come on, he's catching up.
[134:21.61]Go.
[134:21.81]Go.
[134:24.24]Alright, now we're moving on.
[134:26.03]We're moving on to circulation.
[134:26.91]Alright, I'm still ahead.
[134:41.91]I think I should do a risk factor here, maybe.
[134:46.95]Circulation, here we go.
[134:49.43]Uh, hypertension.
[134:50.67]High cholesterol.
[134:52.01]Blood clots.
[134:53.33]We're going over here with blood clots.
[134:55.88]Anything I can do for one or two or five?
[134:59.50]I can make him have sex a lot.
[135:00.56]Maybe we have to give him that.
[135:02.14]That sounds like a good idea.
[135:02.86]I need six.
[135:10.60]Let's go.
[135:13.39]Eight.
[135:14.71]Uh, hypertension.
[135:15.31]Let's get it up there.
[135:16.87]Get it going.
[135:17.23]You need to just drain him.
[135:21.74]The STD was good, yeah.
[135:23.12]I'll do that next.
[135:24.08]It's only four.
[135:29.90]Is it worth it?
[135:32.98]Let's do it.
[135:36.84]STDs.
[135:42.99]He's going to catch up here, because I did that.
[135:44.53]89. 89.
[135:51.85]What can I do?
[135:52.29]Digestive.
[135:54.90]He's 8, 7, 7, we need 8.
[136:02.68]Come on!
[136:03.72]He's catching up!
[136:04.62]I'm only 1% ahead of him.
[136:06.06]I need to start to spiral him out of control.
[136:07.90]Alright, let's get out of here.
[136:16.34]Let's go to...
[136:19.42]Uh, respiratory and digestive.
[136:20.66]Oh, let's go to immune, actually.
[136:21.68]Let's start to bring some of these down.
[136:23.76]I can upgrade, too.
[136:28.52]Okay, here we go.
[136:28.98]He's having sex.
[136:31.10]Spin it quick.
[136:31.52]I don't even care what it is.
[136:34.62]Got it.
[136:34.88]What is it?
[136:35.56]Gonorrhea.
[136:37.30]He has gonorrhea now.
[136:38.13]Good.
[136:38.59]Now he's, like, all fucked up.
[136:39.65]Perfect.
[136:40.03]It actually worked out.
[136:47.39]That's four.
[136:48.31]Yep.
[136:51.97]Come on.
[136:54.40]Don't need to do anything more to Reno.
[136:55.44]Okay, 50% more points.
[137:06.84]Let's get in here into respiratory.
[137:11.06]What we got?
[137:12.36]Give him the flu.
[137:14.32]Start the process.
[137:15.58]Fuck, he's now at 80%.
[137:16.14]Really?
[137:16.30]Come on.
[137:18.85]I feel like spinning that wheel might have been a bad idea.
[137:20.41]Because it only happens for like a few seconds.
[137:27.80]Still ahead.
[137:32.94]Shit, he's like rapidly declining now.
[137:40.51]What do I focus on?
[137:41.31]Maybe somewhere to bring the... I gotta bring the whole house down here.
[137:48.11]What do we got?
[137:49.15]Non-spider is now more sensitive to light.
[137:51.93]Photosensitivity?
[137:56.32]Where is it?
[137:59.66]Fuck.
[138:01.46]I don't know what to do!
[138:02.64]I don't know what to do.
[138:03.20]There it is.
[138:03.50]Photosensitivity.
[138:04.00]It's already evolved.
[138:04.98]How?
[138:05.40]Okay.
[138:12.91]I'm getting diabetes.
[138:15.85]It's still close.
[138:21.47]I need to wait now.
[138:22.09]I gotta take out something.
[138:23.63]Because this is just too close now.
[138:35.57]God damn it.
[138:36.19]Did that really disappear?
[138:37.39]I just got so fucked right there.
[138:40.79]We need a... He's in critical condition.
[138:42.49]We need to do... He got stroke.
[138:45.47]We'll give him a stroke.
[138:46.71]Get to 22.
[138:47.52]And it'll pull this way down.
[138:59.20]Fatigue.
[139:00.90]Stroke will take this all the way down.
[139:02.40]And then I can focus on, uh, we'll do digestive and skeletal.
[139:05.60]Hopefully we can catch up in time.
[139:06.52]It says systems are failing.
[139:15.80]Yes, they are.
[139:18.70]Come on.
[139:21.78]It's gonna take too much time.
[139:22.66]Fuck it.
[139:22.94]No, it's already here.
[139:23.48]It's right here.
[139:23.80]It's already here.
[139:30.80]Bring him down.
[139:31.92]There we go.
[139:32.50]Rapidly decreasing.
[139:34.54]Skeletal.
[139:41.38]What do we got?
[139:43.21]Okay, no.
[139:44.19]We gotta bring him down the other places.
[139:46.73]Muscular?
[139:47.79]No.
[139:51.33]Where's the highest we got?
[139:52.63]Skeletal?
[139:53.39]No, we're gonna stay here.
[139:56.70]Getting some gastroenteritis.
[139:59.82]We pull ahead yet?
[140:02.68]53 versus 52.
[140:03.72]I'm catching up.
[140:12.64]Faster, faster, faster, faster.
[140:14.06]There we go.
[140:21.21]I'm now tied.
[140:23.44]He's exposed to more viruses than usual.
[140:25.82]Here we go.
[140:26.54]Bingo.
[140:29.02]Give him... No.
[140:29.65]What do we need?
[140:30.45]We need... He's unlocked now.
[140:32.13]15.
[140:34.37]Here we go.
[140:42.99]Oh, it's going everywhere.
[140:49.59]How am I still at 39%?
[140:57.58]Oh my god, how is he- I have two failures!
[141:09.35]You know what I'm saying?
[141:09.91]Like, I got two completely failed systems, and he has none.
[141:13.21]And I'm gonna lose.
[141:14.11]I almost have three total failures.
[141:23.65]And you're telling me that my guy's still alive compared to his guy?
[141:32.17]No, I don't have sex right now.
[141:33.59]What a waste of time.
[141:38.07]Oh my god, I didn't even get anything either.
[141:39.93]Look at this.
[141:44.17]That's so long.
[141:44.97]It's such a waste of time.
[141:52.39]He's gonna die.
[141:53.43]None of his systems failed.
[141:54.49]I have almost total system failure.
[141:57.31]And I'm gonna lose.
[141:57.91]Are you kidding me?
[142:03.89]What is left in this guy?
[142:12.29]Five out of, I only had three systems that was still alive.
[142:17.01]None of his systems were even offline.
[142:18.49]Are you serious?
[142:29.59]Like this guy had like just a little bit of everything.
[142:32.42]I had, everything was dead.
[142:36.96]Alright, we're not gonna do STDs this time.
[142:45.22]I mean, you'd think that if you had a total system failure, it'd bring your overall health down.
[142:49.30]Especially if you had five system failures.
[142:52.91]I guess you just have to spread out everything.
[142:55.39]So we need to go to, like, every category and just do the first thing.
[143:00.11]I guess that's what you have to do.
[143:10.99]Now let's go to respiratory.
[143:14.43]Seven, five.
[143:15.15]I needed the final upgrade.
[143:23.42]Maybe.
[143:24.28]That might be what it is.
[143:25.06]Okay, let's go to digestive.
[143:32.38]No, we're going to go to digestive.
[143:35.40]Bones.
[143:35.86]These are all locked.
[143:39.40]Let's go with... Let's go with just puking in the toilet.
[143:49.31]This guy's a walking corpse.
[143:50.88]And somebody was still having sex with him.
[143:53.26]Apparently.
[143:53.84]Okay, we need skeletal.
[144:03.21]Why can I not do anything here?
[144:08.37]um it looks like we're just gonna go back to what's the highest we have here respiratory 11 let's go with I can't do anything I think I have to go to um the other thing there I need a risk factor what is the risk factor I need over 60 obese let's see here no I needed the other one
[144:37.61]Sorry, I'm still actually pretty far ahead right now.
[144:39.83]Well... I wish I had time to read that.
[144:50.44]Make him small.
[144:56.34]Okay, what do I need for skeletal shit?
[144:58.30]Does it tell you?
[145:00.52]I can't even... I wish it told me what I needed.
[145:01.76]I need to have 60 years old.
[145:08.13]I need 12 fucking points for this shit.
[145:14.30]Damn.
[145:17.34]He's gonna catch up by then.
[145:23.94]I'm gonna keep hurting him because I want to be far ahead here.
[145:27.51]Let's go with back to digestion.
[145:32.11]There we go.
[145:34.31]Now the next thing I'm gonna shoot for, I'm gonna try to get old age.
[145:46.58]Alright, still pretty far ahead.
[145:51.96]Do I know what Mork and Mindy is?
[145:53.42]I do.
[145:54.83]It's Robin Williams.
[145:55.99]Okay, one more point.
[146:03.39]And we can bring him to old age and do some skeleton shit.
[146:10.98]Let's see what risk factor is.
[146:12.90]Elderly!
[146:14.98]Now we can do bones.
[146:16.36]There we go.
[146:17.16]Osteoporosis, arthritis, I can do it right now.
[146:19.24]Alright, here we go.
[146:24.22]Going good so far.
[146:24.97]Do I have an upgrade yet?
[146:25.79]Not yet!
[146:29.05]I'm still very far ahead.
[146:32.53]I'm going to do... I want muscular.
[146:34.55]Let's go with muscular.
[146:37.23]Try to get him a couple of problems in the muscle department because it's the slowest one besides respiratory.
[146:44.94]What do I need to afford here?
[146:46.58]Muscular.
[146:48.51]I need 7 or 21.
[146:49.35]We'll just go with 7.
[147:00.53]I'm ahead.
[147:00.97]I want to be confidently ahead by more than 10 to 15%.
[147:03.77]Chronic muscle cramps.
[147:09.61]That leads us to fibromyalgia.
[147:11.39]Okay, now skeletal.
[147:12.56]I want to bring this down.
[147:14.78]I can upgrade here.
[147:15.40]Let's do that immediately while we're still ahead by 10%.
[147:17.52]There it is.
[147:25.31]Alright, come on.
[147:29.69]Bring him down.
[147:34.72]Come on.
[147:43.84]I thought that was supposed to increase, not decrease my amount of virus nodes I can pick up.
[147:49.24]What do I need for Skeletal to move on?
[147:52.02]We need 12.
[147:54.80]12 to go to Osteoporosis.
[147:59.25]I'm gonna do it.
[148:01.03]This has to come down a lot faster, judging by the last two tries.
[148:08.93]Faster, please.
[148:14.09]He's starting to... The gap is being closed here.
[148:24.94]I want to be yellow in everything.
[148:28.86]Okay, got it.
[148:30.38]Osteoporosis.
[148:31.16]Now we can focus on respiratory after this.
[148:37.18]I might do another risk factor after I do another respiratory problem.
[148:40.31]I feel like that's the correct way to do it.
[148:48.23]Should bring me down faster now.
[148:51.11]Hopefully.
[148:53.31]Alright, respiratory.
[148:58.54]What do you got for me?
[148:59.08]We got bronchitis.
[149:00.42]We got this.
[149:01.20]Let's go with bronchitis just because it's available.
[149:03.04]And then we'll go right to chronic bronchitis.
[149:09.01]What is level two?
[149:09.95]I can't do it yet.
[149:13.81]His respiratory is doing... I gotta... He's gonna go into failure here for one of these.
[149:17.31]But as we saw last time, it doesn't seem to matter.
[149:18.97]As long as you bring it all down as quick as you can.
[149:22.89]Every category.
[149:30.11]Reciparatory.
[149:31.63]Respiratory!
[149:33.85]Fuck, I missed it.
[149:38.29]That was almost bad.
[149:41.25]Let's do that one more time just to get it out of the way.
[149:48.44]Was he at 71?
[149:49.86]73?
[149:50.40]Fuck.
[149:52.80]I need a big bad disease here.
[149:55.49]On where?
[149:56.11]I'm not sure yet.
[150:03.27]Where am I closest to?
[150:04.51]We can do... I can do Crohn's disease, but... I'm doing it right now.
[150:10.15]That'll bring this down a lot.
[150:15.46]Shit, he's really close in the gap now.
[150:19.99]I need more damage.
[150:21.00]I need more damage.
[150:28.32]Where are my random upgrades?
[150:31.06]Back into risk factors.
[150:32.95]Unlucky.
[150:33.43]Let's give him this too.
[150:38.97]Because that's going to be bad for a lot of things.
[150:43.14]He's going to close the gap and pass right by me.
[150:45.20]Look at this.
[150:51.36]What's our DPS at?
[150:52.64]I know, really.
[150:56.71]What?
[150:57.71]What the fuck, man?
[150:59.09]Come on.
[150:59.91]I did the same thing he did last time.
[151:04.60]Like, look at his, look at that.
[151:05.98]Look at how much faster his is going.
[151:07.26]I had like, oh, that's so annoying.
[151:16.34]Look at how rapidly his shit is falling and I had almost all of my systems were down and it didn't do anything.
[151:30.59]This guy gets one system failure and he's losing a percentage every like second.
[151:40.25]I had five of these were dead and I was losing maybe 1% every two or three seconds.
[151:56.41]I'm gonna lose.
[151:57.51]It's like, whatever.
[152:03.32]That's what system failure means?
[152:04.88]Well, when I had fucking 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, I had only 3 that was still remaining.
[152:10.60]How did he still live?
[152:12.23]Look at how rapidly this is happening.
[152:15.63]He's in much better condition than my guy was.
[152:27.01]I already lost at this point.
[152:31.29]You can live with no bones?
[152:32.61]You can't live with a brain, heart, respiratory, immune system, or your muscles.
[152:41.80]That guy went from 60 to 0 in less than one minute.
[153:08.32]I'm gonna go back to the helping people one.
[153:20.53]Do I have to race against a clock against an AI opponent?
[153:25.08]That apparently has everything... Diagnose all diseases before it's too late.
[153:29.10]We'll do this one.
[153:29.68]This one sounds fun.
[153:41.49]We got a raid coming in?
[153:44.69]Oh shit, hold on, who is it?
[153:45.73]Oh hey, Tag!
[153:49.86]Thank you, Tag, for the raid.
[153:51.92]Hi guys.
[153:53.66]Hope you had fun on Tag's stream.
[153:57.36]Welcome to my stream.
[154:01.32]Hope you guys are all doing well.
[154:02.94]We're playing this game that is about saving people and hurting people.
[154:10.17]Looks very fun.
[154:11.93]We've been playing it for a few hours now.
[154:13.63]I'm enjoying it.
[154:17.39]We'll do this one.
[154:19.90]Alright, so I gotta do it as fast as I can.
[154:22.84]I have to diagnose every disease.
[154:24.40]See, I'm better at helping people than I am hurting people.
[154:26.14]Don't you understand?
[154:27.46]We'll do this first try.
[154:28.98]Identify the 12 diseases before Hagrid dies.
[154:34.28]You got it.
[154:35.34]It's got circulatory problem.
[154:36.22]That's number one.
[154:39.93]Bingo.
[154:40.57]Circulation.
[154:41.37]We got abdominal pain.
[154:42.21]He's got a skin rash.
[154:43.95]Fatigue.
[154:44.83]Chest pain.
[154:45.95]Bingo.
[154:46.16]I'm going to tell you right now, I think it's angio.
[154:49.40]Run the test.
[154:52.74]We're going to nip that one in the butt right now.
[154:59.35]There you go.
[155:00.15]He's got them all.
[155:00.95]He's got high cholesterol, hypertension, angina.
[155:04.59]This guy's got an angina, okay?
[155:10.51]Uh Last test positive one day ago.
[155:12.31]Wait, what is this?
[155:12.95]Why why don't no points for this?
[155:15.35]Oh, it's alright.
[155:15.81]It's just okay.
[155:16.15]You just have to diagnose.
[155:16.95]Okay, I get you understand Pangea One two three What else we got abdominal pain fatigue abdominal pain and fatigue
[155:41.00]And he's got chest pain still.
[155:42.14]Alright, we're gonna go with... We're gonna do some... We're gonna do an abdominal CT scan.
[155:49.71]No, we're not.
[155:50.07]We're gonna do that in a minute.
[155:55.99]Let's get some more points.
[155:58.19]Immune boost.
[155:59.63]AI-rigged immune system is in overdrive and producing more white blood cells.
[156:03.67]More resources will spawn for the next few days.
[156:05.51]Got it.
[156:05.81]Just collect.
[156:08.68]Don't do anything yet.
[156:09.46]Wait till you get more points.
[156:17.25]We good?
[156:18.19]We good.
[156:18.69]Okay.
[156:23.77]Okay, what was I gonna do?
[156:28.76]We got abdominal pain, skin rash, chest pains.
[156:36.40]I think he has, uh, I think he might have leukemia.
[156:40.10]That's what I'm gonna say.
[156:40.92]He's got the fatigue there, the skin rashes there, headache and everything.
[156:43.78]Let's get that cured.
[156:46.37]Next up, we got more fatigue, more abdominal pain.
[156:51.01]Pancreatitis, we can do a CT scan of the stomach.
[156:59.81]He just needs rest.
[157:06.08]That blended in with his body.
[157:11.82]Skeleton wasn't even down at all.
[157:23.04]okay he did not okay there yeah he did have he did have an abdominal aortic aneurysm I knew it alright let's let's take a look at him for first of all let's see circulatory system is the one that's in the most trouble abdominal pain this is currently testing skin rash uh we gotta go over here just take a look I I I think it's lupus
[157:59.90]Remember guys, it's always lupus.
[158:01.28]4 out of 12.
[158:14.43]It's never lupus.
[158:16.91]Here we go.
[158:18.35]Excuse me.
[158:19.43]What's that?
[158:20.47]It's never lupus?
[158:22.19]It is this time.
[158:25.32]It is.
[158:26.44]We got more chest pains.
[158:27.34]Fatigue.
[158:29.47]What else we got?
[158:29.95]Abdominal pain and fatigue.
[158:34.97]We might have a little, we might have a, uh, we're gonna have to do a colonoscopy on him.
[158:44.75]How am I doing on upgrades?
[158:46.13]Good.
[158:47.09]Halfway there.
[158:48.07]Still okay.
[158:53.30]Nope.
[158:54.30]Okay.
[158:56.68]So what is it then?
[158:58.14]Fatigue and chest pain.
[159:00.22]Abdominal pain and fatigue.
[159:05.84]Irritable bowel?
[159:07.48]Run the test.
[159:09.92]I need money.
[159:16.26]Circulatory is fucked right now.
[159:23.00]I gotta do this now.
[159:24.88]He probably has an embulism.
[159:30.97]Make him pay you.
[159:37.51]Nervous system's bad, too.
[159:43.45]There it is.
[159:45.99]And... Dr. Dermot is wrong.
[159:49.35]I was gonna say right every time.
[159:51.30]Fatigue.
[159:53.55]No, it's not anything in the respiratory.
[159:54.93]It's probably one of these.
[159:58.46]Yeah, alright.
[159:59.10]I got it.
[159:59.70]He's got fucking cysts.
[160:02.30]I'm gonna do a full scan.
[160:05.56]Was it eight?
[160:07.21]I think it's one of these.
[160:07.91]Yeah, we're gonna give him a renal MRI.
[160:12.97]Fuck, I missed it.
[160:25.14]Okay, so what was it down here, right?
[160:27.66]Get fatigue and... elevated heart rate, abdominal pain.
[160:32.37]It's none of these.
[160:34.01]Let's go for a cyst exam.
[160:40.33]Give up on the circulation?
[160:41.67]Uh, not yet.
[160:42.95]I mean, I did already test it for that.
[160:45.22]Maybe it's one of these.
[160:45.84]I mean, it could have, like, a heart attack.
[160:50.50]How would I not know if it was a heart attack by now?
[160:52.50]Alright, we'll do a heart attack test.
[161:00.48]Lupus is almost cured.
[161:08.65]Let's test his heart.
[161:13.97]Let's see.
[161:14.73]Brain MRI.
[161:15.72]No, I want to see if he has one of these two things.
[161:21.08]His heart's being monitored.
[161:22.00]Alright, here we go.
[161:29.60]Damn it!
[161:30.44]No kidney stones.
[161:32.62]Now go back.
[161:33.88]This is gonna be the big kicker here.
[161:35.02]This is gonna be the end of the episode.
[161:36.18]When we talk about how the guy was eating kitty litter or something.
[161:39.74]There it is.
[161:40.20]He's got an arrhythmia.
[161:44.03]Like in every episode, the guy ends up like, Whoa, wait, hold on.
[161:46.69]When you were 14, you ate a bunch of kitty litter?
[161:48.61]That's why you have a pulmonary lupus.
[161:51.17]Alright, abdominal pain.
[161:52.89]We still have to figure this out.
[161:56.45]I'm gonna say it's... It's probably irritable bowel.
[162:01.50]What does it take to do this?
[162:05.65]I need six.
[162:07.01]Six.
[162:11.37]He had a dead animal on his walls.
[162:15.23]Alright, let's do it.
[162:17.71]Irritable bowel.
[162:22.78]Seven out of twelve.
[162:23.44]Now he's in the emergency room.
[162:33.17]Mm-hmm.
[162:34.89]God damn it.
[162:38.37]So what else is it?
[162:39.93]What is causing you fatigue?
[162:45.07]Chest pains, like I already, it's none of these.
[162:47.25]It's over here now.
[162:56.00]So it has to be this one.
[162:57.40]It has to be, and these are the most crucial right now.
[163:00.26]Pancreatitis.
[163:02.44]Pancreatitis.
[163:04.10]Whatever the hell it's called.
[163:16.12]Give me a point!
[163:20.80]Do a brain transplant.
[163:21.98]It's the only... Like, what is causing all this?
[163:24.68]Leg pain?
[163:25.28]What else you got?
[163:31.45]It's Pancreatitis.
[163:36.37]He's probably gonna be dead by then anyways.
[163:41.86]This is rapidly failing here.
[163:51.52]And was I correct?
[163:56.46]Oh my fucking Lord.
[164:01.10]You don't get, you don't, abdominal pain doesn't come from your brain.
[164:04.25]Does it?
[164:06.41]He has, just, is it cancer?
[164:08.65]Do an ultrasound.
[164:23.90]Oh my goodness.
[164:24.68]Okay, it is.
[164:27.45]Alright, what else is causing this fatigue?
[164:28.99]Alright, anxiety, fatigue.
[164:32.63]Up here.
[164:34.75]Let's do a, let's do, I need to do, hold on, fatigue.
[164:41.25]Fatigue and chest pain.
[164:42.43]Okay, he definitely has, he's definitely burnt out.
[164:54.49]Come on, just don't lose this before, because I know I'm going to get this now.
[164:58.03]I only have a few more to do.
[165:01.63]Psychological evaluation.
[165:02.79]It's going to end up being burnt out.
[165:06.11]And then he's going to die in front of me when I do it.
[165:08.68]It's not going to be good.
[165:10.08]What?
[165:17.72]God damn it.
[165:18.50]It's...
[165:24.92]I'm gonna lose.
[165:26.66]Oh, God damn it.
[165:31.37]Time to amputate.
[165:32.43]Here it comes.
[165:41.07]It's gonna be... Why in the world?
[165:45.32]What is causing this?
[165:48.06]Chest pains.
[165:49.24]Headache.
[165:50.30]Anxiety.
[165:51.30]Oh, it's this one.
[165:53.76]Chronic stress.
[166:01.22]He's stressed out?
[166:01.82]Hey, look at that.
[166:02.92]He's stressed out.
[166:04.44]Alright, fatigue.
[166:06.36]Headache.
[166:07.46]Fatigue and headache.
[166:09.08]Bingo.
[166:11.43]Now you're really an insomniac, I think.
[166:13.19]We're going to do a sleep test.
[166:14.29]Sleep study.
[166:16.55]I know you're barely with us right now, but it's alright.
[166:18.37]Do a sleep test.
[166:26.65]Okay.
[166:27.41]We're going to do a sleep study on him.
[166:32.38]Doing all these tests and it was just stress.
[166:36.90]I think we'll be fine.
[166:39.18]Here it comes.
[166:40.86]Only one more disease after this to figure out.
[166:46.32]And it is... Come on.
[166:48.84]Got it!
[166:49.84]Done.
[166:50.76]Chronic fatigue and insomnia.
[166:52.52]Game over.
[166:54.58]No more symptoms.
[167:01.38]I win.
[167:05.28]He's good.
[167:07.42]You won.
[167:12.10]12 diseases treated.
[167:12.88]80% diagnosis efficiency.
[167:14.98]That's pretty good for a doctor, I'd say.
[167:16.72]80% of my patients are happy customers.
[167:25.55]Just took 120 days.
[167:29.23]Residency.
[167:29.71]Treat all diseases before it's too late.
[167:32.27]So this is diagnose all the diseases.
[167:33.81]This is treat all the diseases before it's too late.
[167:35.87]20% are dead.
[167:46.13]80% lived.
[167:46.31]Uh...
[168:02.83]John Arbuckle.
[168:04.49]No, I would let it die if it was John Arbuckle.
[168:10.70]I like that.
[168:11.12]Twitch chat.
[168:12.24]Let's see what's wrong with you guys.
[168:17.24]Oh, I need... Okay, now I have three points.
[168:21.84]Treatments are 10% cheaper.
[168:27.71]The game crashed.
[168:29.15]And it says, fatal error.
[168:30.69]Too many heap sections.
[168:35.94]Crashed.
[168:37.08]No, I don't want to open the folder.
[168:41.59]Well, okay.
[168:42.99]Hopefully it saved my progress.
[168:44.09]Let's try it again.
[169:01.55]All of that's loud.
[169:06.86]Okay.
[169:08.70]Bionic Redemption.
[169:15.11]Play the next game.
[169:17.43]This is what we're doing tonight.
[169:19.97]I'm currently enjoying this.
[169:23.31]I am the overall 21,642nd best doctor in the world.
[169:28.73]How many doctors are in the world?
[169:29.65]Let's see.
[169:33.43]How...
[169:36.46]Many doctors are in the world.
[169:41.84]As previously mentioned, the World Health Organization estimates that a shortage of 4.3 million physicians, nurses, and other health workers worldwide.
[169:52.37]What?
[169:53.83]Oh, that means that there's... How many doctors are there?
[169:59.14]In principle, though, it is generally agreed that there are 13 official doctors.
[170:06.23]Wait, what?
[170:09.21]No, this is... No, this is... How... William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton, John Pertwee, John Baker, Jodie Whittaker.
[170:19.85]Are these, like, scientists or something?
[170:24.68]These must be the people that made, like, all the... 13 doctors ever.
[170:35.05]Doctor Who, a brief history of time travel.
[170:38.85]Alright, no, these are the 13 doctors in Doctor Who.
[170:42.81]How many doctors are there?
[170:44.03]Apparently this is the answer you get.
[170:49.41]How many doctors are there in the United States?
[170:58.42]Alright, hold on.
[171:01.66]Statistics and facts on US physicians and doctors.
[171:03.99]In 2013, according to 2013, there were over 1 million doctors in medicine all over the United States.
[171:13.37]So, I'm the 21st thousandth doctor.
[171:22.80]Well, whatever.
[171:24.42]Let's go.
[171:28.43]Choose life.
[171:29.57]I like healing better.
[171:31.05]It's easier.
[171:36.27]I'm going through med school.
[171:39.19]Treat all the diseases.
[171:40.15]And it's gonna be Twitch chat.
[171:43.88]Twitch chatters.
[171:46.76]Males.
[171:50.22]Environment.
[171:50.92]Days last 20% longer.
[171:52.72]I like this.
[171:53.88]Start it up.
[171:55.10]Treat all illnesses.
[172:01.99]Got the boost.
[172:03.60]Okay, treat all diseases.
[172:05.30]Let's see what kind of problems you guys got.
[172:07.46]Let's take a look.
[172:11.73]Muscle weakness.
[172:13.39]Loss of reflexes.
[172:15.66]I mean, you guys, like, are sitting here watching the stream.
[172:17.48]You guys, like, are not even good at video games.
[172:19.68]You know, your reflexes aren't that good.
[172:21.34]Fatigue.
[172:21.70]You're probably up late, tired.
[172:23.58]Shortness of breath.
[172:24.10]You're laughing at this stream all the time.
[172:26.10]I'm making you laugh all over the place.
[172:27.46]Chest pain included in shortness of breath from laughing at the jokes.
[172:30.28]Memory loss.
[172:31.22]You got flashed by the fucking frog.
[172:33.20]Anxiety.
[172:33.78]When's it gonna stream again?
[172:34.88]When's this guy gonna stream again?
[172:35.94]Dizziness.
[172:37.28]Add that to chest pain and shortness of breath from the laughter.
[172:39.22]You're laughing so much you're getting dizzy.
[172:40.58]And your legs are swelling.
[172:42.18]You're just sitting down so often.
[172:44.08]And then you have irregular heartbeats, too.
[172:48.23]I mean, like, I don't know.
[172:49.61]That actually sounds like a real problem.
[172:50.94]You might want to get that checked out.
[172:55.42]Okay, so let's go.
[172:57.74]Muscle weakness.
[172:58.92]Let's go.
[172:59.46]I'm going to assume with fatigue and muscle weakness, we've got muscular dystrophy.
[173:06.14]When are we going to do that?
[173:07.82]That looks like the most dangerous of them all.
[173:09.92]So we'll do that first.
[173:17.97]has a pretty good fucking doctor, I would say.
[173:24.57]Circulatory is going down pretty rapidly as well.
[173:29.53]Oh, we got less than 190 days to do this.
[173:32.77]Good thing I did the thing where the days are longer.
[173:34.39]Alright, let's see if this is it.
[173:38.11]Let's do a muscle biopsy on you guys.
[173:44.15]Keep collecting.
[173:48.36]I actually do have an irregular heartbeat.
[173:57.79]Okay.
[173:59.23]Let's see if I was right.
[174:03.15]Not much longer.
[174:07.71]Oh, it takes a while, man.
[174:09.27]We're wasting too many days.
[174:11.07]Hopefully this is correct.
[174:11.97]And this is a big one if this is correct.
[174:14.81]I'm going to get the Nobel Prize for this one.
[174:19.46]No prize for me.
[174:22.06]So we got muscle weakness, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, memory loss.
[174:28.64]I mean, these two would match over here.
[174:31.28]Whatever this is.
[174:31.88]What is this?
[174:35.71]Do a neurological exam here.
[174:42.17]Test more than one thing at a time?
[174:43.39]I mean, I just don't have enough money.
[174:47.50]Muscle weakness can be one of these.
[174:49.00]What about shortness of breasts?
[174:51.04]Shortness of breasts.
[174:52.92]Now we got fatigue, muscle weakness.
[174:56.10]Those can be H1Z1.
[174:57.20]I need five.
[175:06.43]Let's do that.
[175:08.91]Where was that?
[175:11.35]Let's do a flu test.
[175:14.53]There it is.
[175:14.97]Alright, insomnia.
[175:16.70]Gotta treat the insomnia now.
[175:21.04]18 days.
[175:21.39]I'm gonna fucking lose this.
[175:22.83]Big time.
[175:25.45]I only have 159 days left.
[175:33.98]If he loses, stop talk- Stop talking unless you're a female.
[175:39.80]If he loses-
[175:46.85]Oh, boy.
[175:48.39]Okay, so where are we at here?
[175:49.81]I need to treat this.
[175:54.40]Treatment.
[175:54.84]That's going to take... We can't do the... That's going to take too long.
[175:57.68]Fatigue, shortness of breath.
[176:01.66]Still has the muscle weakness.
[176:06.59]What about down here?
[176:08.43]Any of these match?
[176:09.09]Dizziness.
[176:11.45]Memory loss.
[176:12.43]Anxiety.
[176:19.81]I'm gonna do like, let's just do like a fucking brain scan.
[176:23.41]Let's just do, do I have enough for a neurological exam?
[176:26.07]No.
[176:32.07]It's okay, I'm an anime girl online.
[176:38.19]Well, here you go.
[176:41.68]Let's do a, where is it?
[176:45.99]neurological exam or let's see loss of muscle weakness we need to just do like a fucking straight up just psychological examination on him his omni is cured 145 days left Twitch chat is meeting with a psychologist right now
[177:14.47]Circulation seems to be the circulation of the nervous system.
[177:16.75]It's definitely mental or blood related.
[177:23.06]Fuck you.
[177:30.74]Fatigue, shortness of breath, anxiety.
[177:33.76]I mean, maybe like, it's always angio.
[177:37.42]Run the test.
[177:52.90]So what the hell could it be?
[177:54.00]It's bone?
[177:56.24]Is it a bone problem?
[177:58.98]Fatigue, chest pain.
[178:01.34]I mean, swelling of the legs, maybe, right?
[178:05.46]Leg swelling, bruising.
[178:09.62]No, it's definitely mental.
[178:10.74]It's definitely something up here.
[178:12.30]It's definitely, you guys, somebody has, it has to be Parkinson's, right?
[178:20.58]Upgrade the resources?
[178:21.48]I can't.
[178:22.51]I need to diagnose three diseases before I can do this.
[178:29.11]It's either the heart or it's the brain.
[178:36.04]So I'm going to do this.
[178:37.50]We're going to do a PET scan.
[178:50.36]Fatigue.
[178:52.12]Shortness of breath.
[178:53.28]I mean, maybe one of these over here.
[178:54.46]Anxiety.
[178:58.50]Legs and swelling.
[178:59.50]I mean, maybe I'm just gonna do a general heart exam here.
[179:02.31]Ultrasounds.
[179:03.43]Run it.
[179:07.23]And then do something else here too.
[179:11.77]Shortness of breath.
[179:12.98]Can I do one of these?
[179:13.60]Yeah, we're gonna do this as well.
[179:19.83]Do an MRI.
[179:21.45]We'll do that next.
[179:28.17]Ban all men from the chat.
[179:30.69]Okay, he's got blood clots.
[179:35.68]Insomnia, I gotta treat this six days.
[179:40.60]Blood clots is, I gotta get five points.
[179:46.22]Come on, let me double whammy here.
[179:48.99]Bingo.
[179:50.37]Antigram.
[179:50.99]Fuck.
[179:52.35]Ugh.
[179:53.57]Well, at least I got that.
[179:55.45]I need more points.
[179:56.23]Might as well just treat this.
[180:12.31]That's traded already.
[180:13.29]So what else is causing this heart problems?
[180:18.53]That's already been tested.
[180:20.37]These have already been tested.
[180:21.59]This all the way down here?
[180:22.93]Heart attack?
[180:23.43]I mean, it could be a heart attack.
[180:28.51]Right?
[180:30.03]Like chest pain, shortness of breath.
[180:32.59]Or it could be arrhythmia.
[180:35.01]He's got all three of them.
[180:35.97]Let's try this.
[180:38.17]I can check it both.
[180:39.55]I need to check for a heart attack.
[180:41.24]You would know if it was a heart attack.
[180:42.72]113 days left.
[180:54.38]It's the flu.
[180:57.40]By the way, have you been sneezing lately?
[181:01.08]He's had an 85-day heart attack.
[181:05.20]I've just kept this guy in like a bubble.
[181:08.20]I wonder what's wrong with him.
[181:09.16]He's gripping his chest and screaming.
[181:12.84]Might want to do a urine test.
[181:21.66]Come on, I need one more point.
[181:29.69]Alright, this should be it.
[181:31.09]I would be surprised if it wasn't either heart attack or arrhythmia.
[181:38.27]Do the whole thing, run it.
[181:39.21]Let's do, what else can we look at here?
[181:43.67]I have five points left.
[181:46.07]Fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, anxiety.
[181:51.93]Alright, let's take a look at this.
[181:53.80]Major depression.
[181:57.56]It's got three.
[181:59.34]Three out of the fatigue, anxiety, loss of reflexes.
[182:03.86]We're going to do this next.
[182:04.80]Eight.
[182:13.50]I've got to get to halfway here soon.
[182:20.64]Give me a fucking break.
[182:24.13]Really?
[182:25.33]It's not any of those things?
[182:27.13]Shortness of breath.
[182:29.75]Chest pain.
[182:30.47]It's gonna be in the lungs.
[182:33.22]It's gonna be this.
[182:33.96]Respiratory failure.
[182:36.36]Right?
[182:36.56]Like, look at this.
[182:37.80]It's everything.
[182:38.66]It has to be this.
[182:42.14]Fuck.
[182:45.94]I'm not gonna let you guys die, okay?
[182:49.59]It's not that.
[182:53.56]Shortness of breath, chest pain, anxiety, memory loss, dizziness, irregular heartbeat, high cholesterol.
[183:21.85]pneumonia throw this Pokémon name nemo nimithrax I don't know it could be anything I have 82 days left to figure it out muscular nervous circulatory what else did I not check in like either one of these categories
[183:51.71]I'm going to sleep.
[183:54.26]Muscle weakness.
[184:00.44]We didn't test.
[184:01.20]I'm going to test for this.
[184:04.49]Because this is the top two major ones.
[184:06.49]And apparently muscle is a huge problem here.
[184:11.33]Check the stress.
[184:17.10]Still can't even upgrade.
[184:23.44]Okay, we're going to see if that's what it is.
[184:29.26]Let's run it.
[184:34.93]Loss of reflexes.
[184:38.45]Muscle weakness and loss of reflexes.
[184:44.33]Can do these too.
[184:47.78]Just eat better for once.
[184:49.22]Come on, we all need to eat better.
[184:57.50]Sounds like circulatory to me.
[185:00.76]Well, I only have... Once you start to eliminate everything, that's when... Even if we have, like, 40 days left.
[185:12.09]Being a doctor is hard, man.
[185:18.63]Come on.
[185:19.05]Please be right so I can just not have to go back there again.
[185:24.88]God damn it.
[185:33.83]It's gonna end up being either- It's gonna be Parkinson's.
[185:36.07]Let's do just a Neurologic.
[185:37.01]This one's cheap and it's quick.
[185:45.71]It's gonna be Parkinson's.
[185:51.84]Nope.
[185:56.04]Is it Pa- Is it Parkinson's?!
[186:01.24]I'm trying to save you guys!
[186:08.89]Well, it would point to the fact that it's one of these three are major problems, but I can't seem to figure out which one.
[186:14.25]Okay, there it is.
[186:15.23]Parkinson's.
[186:19.46]It only takes 14 and 27 days.
[186:21.90]I don't think I'm going to make it.
[186:31.56]I'm not even halfway there.
[186:35.50]somebody was right um okay well that's that what else can we do here now I want to treat the parkinson's right now so I don't worry about it I'm gonna you know we might as well retry you're in it's in the emergency yeah this is this is not good it was parkinson's the whole time
[187:04.26]I wonder if this will slow it down at all.
[187:11.45]So now we're just left with fatigue, which everything is fatigue.
[187:15.75]Shortness of breath.
[187:19.19]Chest pain.
[187:19.91]I mean, we're looking at up here maybe.
[187:21.33]Emphysema.
[187:22.55]I can do an emphysema scan right now.
[187:31.58]This might go quickly.
[187:32.44]Ugh.
[187:36.18]shit really anxiety I mean some of these are like right here for instance like a chronic stress is it just going to be stress again it's going to be chronic stress watch this I did every other oh do a psychological exam run every test
[188:06.98]Still might be possible to do this.
[188:09.30]It's just stress.
[188:13.20]Alright, we got shortness of breath.
[188:15.95]And fatigue.
[188:18.21]Memory loss.
[188:19.61]Dizziness.
[188:21.17]What do we got down here?
[188:23.17]Asthma?
[188:28.47]Allergy test?
[188:29.25]Test for asthma?
[188:30.51]Anybody in here have asthma?
[188:37.10]Already got that upgraded.
[188:37.88]Still might be able to pull this off.
[188:44.42]Asthma.
[188:45.96]Allergy test, run it.
[188:49.47]He forgot to test stress.
[188:50.63]Well, I would assume in like a psychiatric evaluation, the first question somebody would ask, Sir, are you stressed out?
[188:58.31]Do you have any stress?
[188:59.09]Do you have stress in your life?
[189:02.97]That's a psychiatric evaluation.
[189:06.10]What else we got?
[189:06.64]Okay, shortness of breath.
[189:09.44]Dizziness.
[189:12.48]Okay, we have a couple of situations here.
[189:18.11]Thrombosis, high cholesterol.
[189:22.99]How much is the... Okay, we'll do another ultrasound.
[189:27.63]The nervous system is really about to go down here.
[189:30.41]You guys have asthma.
[189:33.53]No, they're all starting to happen here.
[189:35.59]Very quickly.
[189:41.91]One day.
[189:42.29]That's all it takes.
[189:42.87]You just need an inhaler.
[189:43.57]You're gonna be dead, though, unfortunately.
[189:47.83]We got four out of eight.
[189:52.05]Nothing.
[189:52.29]It was not ultrasounds.
[189:53.15]Okay.
[189:55.52]Is this five?
[189:57.24]Six.
[189:57.48]Okay, here we go.
[190:00.03]How much time do we have left?
[190:02.05]Eight days.
[190:03.03]No.
[190:03.51]It's gonna be five.
[190:05.09]You gotta get one right really quickly right off the bat.
[190:11.71]Four days.
[190:12.27]That's it.
[190:13.15]We have five out of eight.
[190:15.15]So what were they?
[190:15.81]Is this gonna be like the price is right?
[190:17.29]Or when it tells you exactly what it was?
[190:21.18]Fatigue.
[190:21.86]Memory loss.
[190:25.50]Alzheimer's?
[190:27.22]How do you not figure these out in a fucking bunch of...
[190:30.47]I did everything but those, really.
[190:35.21]All the psychiatric evaluations I did were for nothing.
[190:41.02]Two days left, yeah, it's over.
[190:43.76]I'm prepared this time.
[190:46.04]Fatigue, irregular heartbeat, dizziness.
[190:48.90]It's gonna be, I need to be sure.
[190:50.38]Is it fucking high cholesterol?
[190:52.94]What is it, one day?
[190:53.52]You're dead.
[191:07.11]Nobody say anything.
[191:09.43]Alright, here we go.
[191:10.35]Let's do it again.
[191:10.99]This time, let's try it again.
[191:12.97]Of course we're gonna do it again.
[191:14.71]Circulatory nervous system.
[191:16.01]Is this the same exact thing?
[191:17.33]It can't be.
[191:18.28]It's probably randomized every time.
[191:22.16]I feel like I should just go for Parkinson's.
[191:23.68]No, we're gonna go stress right off the bat.
[191:25.84]It's so cheap to do.
[191:27.62]Just do it right now.
[191:29.06]Confusion.
[191:30.18]Dizziness.
[191:31.62]Chest pains.
[191:33.06]Shaking.
[191:33.60]Anxiety.
[191:34.88]Okay.
[191:35.89]Stress.
[191:37.66]Just do a stress test.
[191:43.52]Are you stressed?
[191:50.60]Yeah.
[191:51.08]Oh, whoa.
[191:56.11]Okay.
[191:58.69]We got, uh, we got them all.
[192:04.09]That's it.
[192:04.75]Congratulations.
[192:06.01]Move on to the next level, please.
[192:14.01]That's all it took.
[192:19.49]All it took was me to ask the person how they were feeling, if they were stressed out, for me to diagnose every one of their brain illnesses.
[192:25.15]Why even do the ones that cost like 15 to research?
[192:32.54]Here we go.
[192:32.92]Stress management.
[192:33.94]We're gonna do the cheaper ones because we can afford to do the cheaper ones.
[192:40.62]This one is five.
[192:42.50]God damn it, the game crashed, come on.
[192:55.75]That was like a sure thing too.
[193:04.45]I was just getting into it.
[193:05.71]That's so annoying.
[193:10.07]Hey, diagnose your fucking game, guys.
[193:30.43]Well, let's just pretend that didn't happen.
[193:48.42]I don't know.
[193:49.86]You can't just go back and un-kill somebody.
[193:58.58]I don't know.
[194:00.20]Let's do Donald Trump.
[194:03.65]The Grinch.
[194:05.29]Kim Jong-un.
[194:09.48]Halloween.
[194:12.58]Halloween's not a person.
[194:17.22]You know what I mean?
[194:17.82]Halloween is a holiday.
[194:22.52]It's not a... That doesn't make any sense.
[194:28.48]No.
[194:31.06]Wait a minute.
[194:31.50]Remember when we talked about this?
[194:33.58]We talked about this.
[194:35.66]It actually is the person.
[194:37.69]We made the joke earlier.
[194:38.95]Go back.
[194:43.96]It's actually gonna be Donald Trump's face.
[194:46.02]I can't believe this is real.
[194:54.04]It's gonna be like Hillary Clinton.
[194:56.46]The shitty joke that we made earlier is actually for real.
[195:01.72]Alright, who do you want to do it with?
[195:02.90]Let's see.
[195:04.78]Um...
[195:08.26]Jacksepticeye.
[195:10.59]He's gonna be like yelling and shit.
[195:12.47]I need to see.
[195:12.97]We just need to see.
[195:13.65]I just need to see it for a second.
[195:15.23]It's gonna be like Jack's face.
[195:17.83]It's gonna be, right?
[195:18.47]It has to be.
[195:19.41]Why would this be here?
[195:20.85]I'm ready.
[195:23.25]I'm ready for it.
[195:23.89]I'm ready for him to like clap into my screen and say top of the morning to you.
[195:27.52]I can't believe it.
[195:28.10]Here it is.
[195:29.36]Holy shit, dude.
[195:37.94]No, that's... that is a scary face.
[195:44.29]We already did this earlier, and it's in the game.
[195:47.21]Does he have voice lines?
[195:48.35]Please tell me he has voice lines.
[195:49.73]Does he have voice lines?
[195:54.74]That's really important to me.
[195:57.72]Like, when he leans forward and grabs his stomach, they had to have had him record stuff, right?
[196:01.70]Why else would he be here?
[196:07.53]Come on.
[196:11.01]Say something.
[196:18.07]Oh, by the way, that looks nothing like him.
[196:23.63]Alright, I'm ready.
[196:28.82]I guarantee you he played this game.
[196:34.14]I wanna hear his- I wanna hear what he says.
[196:40.00]Can't believe this joke characters.
[196:43.08]Come on.
[196:46.23]That does not look like him I'm waiting for it.
[196:58.96]It might not exist.
[197:00.76]They had a spooky Halloween thing.
[197:02.12]Why wouldn't they have him come into the studio and say something?
[197:09.62]Doesn't matter.
[197:10.06]I'm just gonna wait.
[197:10.86]I'm just here to hear the voice line Well, he's not gonna do it who else is there Choose life continue life campaign
[197:40.79]I'm not- I don't wanna do like- I don't wanna do the meme, people.
[197:46.01]I can't believe this.
[197:48.87]Oompaville... Like, we're not doing Hitler, I don't wanna- like, Donald Trump, the Grinch.
[198:01.50]Just for the sake of seeing him.
[198:03.70]Like, okay, I'm curious.
[198:05.08]Did they actually put Adolf Hitler in this game?
[198:08.06]Is he in the game?
[198:10.76]Is that what's going to be on the screen?
[198:15.34]It is, right?
[198:15.80]It's just like a poorly designed... Oh, my God.
[198:26.58]Okay.
[198:27.32]Alright.
[198:31.34]Well, let's let him die, right?
[198:38.29]Okay.
[198:41.28]Interesting.
[198:41.78]Alright, we'll just let him die.
[198:48.50]Alright, so we know that that exists.
[199:00.49]I can't believe this shit.
[199:06.82]Well, let's save the Grinch because I'm curious as to how this looks.
[199:13.04]You want to see Jesus?
[199:13.92]Maybe next time.
[199:26.15]Take a guess at what happened.
[199:27.15]I bet you'll never guess.
[199:31.83]Do female... Wait, can you do female Hitler?
[199:43.62]That would be odd.
[200:05.11]Let's just save the Grinch.
[200:12.90]Let's do a female Grinch.
[200:18.48]Same thing.
[200:19.00]Days last longer.
[200:20.82]Don't crash.
[200:30.23]It's clearly not a female Grinch.
[200:31.73]I mean, I guess it is.
[200:33.59]And it's Christmas themed.
[200:39.55]This is going to be annoying.
[200:40.69]I don't want to listen to this.
[200:46.90]This is not right.
[200:51.12]Grinch.
[200:52.51]Grinch.
[201:01.17]This is somebody's like fursona.
[201:02.87]This is not even the Grinch.
[201:06.39]Merry Christmas.
[201:08.13]What are we doing?
[201:08.63]Okay, we have to diagnose the Grinch.
[201:10.31]I don't want to listen to this fucking music.
[201:17.23]Swelling, bruising, skin rash.
[201:20.25]You got a female problem?
[201:23.63]I don't want... Okay, pelvic pain.
[201:26.45]Swelling, bruising, skin rash, dizziness, anxiety.
[201:31.16]Let's just go for it.
[201:31.96]I guess let's just do... It's right here.
[201:33.94]It's the first one.
[201:45.03]Christmas mode is actually hard mode.
[201:49.64]There we go.
[201:50.06]Okay, we got one.
[201:52.34]So what do we need to do here?
[201:53.16]We got it right off the bat.
[201:55.04]Eleven days is fine.
[201:55.86]Six points.
[202:03.53]Let's go with six points.
[202:06.47]Got plenty of time.
[202:07.33]Alright, now we got Swelling and Bruising, Skin Rash, Dizziness and Anxiety.
[202:12.67]Okay, we're gonna go with... We'll test for that.
[202:18.48]We need eight.
[202:24.58]What did I just return to?
[202:25.70]You returned to a female Grinch.
[202:31.73]I'm very sorry that you're seeing this.
[202:34.55]Christmas female Grinch.
[202:37.15]Who gives a shit?
[202:47.36]God, I hope it crashes again.
[202:48.64]Don't say that!
[202:52.79]uh let's do let's check for that how did my fan fiction get in this game that's a good question alright we got two in a row here let's go treatment treatment so this is 11 days and um okay 60 efficient didn't it didn't work god damn it what's left to diagnose this muscle weakness chest pain
[203:22.54]I need to get those off the board.
[203:23.60]Because their nervous system is very bad.
[203:30.67]Let's go to nervous system.
[203:32.95]Chest pain.
[203:33.97]Mood swings.
[203:34.81]Dizziness.
[203:37.09]Anxiety.
[203:38.23]Just do stress.
[203:39.97]Always just start with the electrosonic hologram.
[203:42.73]Every time.
[203:49.24]Rapidly losing nervous system.
[203:50.72]This is not good at all.
[203:54.77]Can I get some points for Christ's sake?
[203:56.25]It's gonna be stress.
[204:05.12]This is very quick.
[204:05.86]Hopefully we can stop this now.
[204:11.52]And there it is.
[204:12.40]Stress, of course.
[204:15.70]What else is causing these problems?
[204:18.48]Mood swings.
[204:19.84]Anxiety.
[204:22.08]Alzheimer's.
[204:22.82]I mean, it could be any one of these.
[204:25.52]We have to treat this like right now though.
[204:36.49]Quickly.
[204:41.71]And let's upgrade.
[204:48.07]That's a mask of the Grinch.
[204:54.53]Fuck.
[204:54.97]Nervous system is going down so rapidly.
[204:56.68]For the love of God.
[205:00.18]What is it?
[205:00.92]What is causing this?
[205:03.82]What is causing this?
[205:05.51]Muscle weakness.
[205:06.13]What do we got?
[205:09.59]I don't know.
[205:10.09]It could be any of these that are causing this massive drop.
[205:20.30]Which one do I do?
[205:21.54]Let's just do another... Just get this out of the way.
[205:23.79]It can't get one day.
[205:28.67]Damn it.
[205:35.53]No.
[205:36.11]Not insomnia, not that.
[205:37.41]It's gonna be Parkinson's.
[205:41.28]It's always Parkinson's, apparently.
[205:45.24]Don't do a total system shutdown here.
[205:54.83]Alright, come on.
[205:56.77]What the hell?
[206:01.95]Don't!
[206:02.57]Don't!
[206:02.97]Is this... It's Parkinson's.
[206:08.15]It's Parkinson's.
[206:08.93]It's Parkinson's fucking like three times.
[206:15.07]Systems are all failing now.
[206:16.40]I can't do any intensive care.
[206:19.06]Yes, I can.
[206:23.36]Does it have to be Parkinson's every time?
[206:29.10]Seriously.
[206:32.43]Now I have to do this before everything shuts down.
[206:42.77]Now we gotta get 14 points.
[206:49.57]Has there been one case where the Parkinson's wasn't one of the things that you had to do?
[207:04.13]Now there's a muscle problem that I wasn't able to diagnose because I was running around in circles doing the thing that it is every fucking single time.
[207:12.25]It's these two every single time.
[207:16.36]I don't even need to look at a chart.
[207:17.44]I'm gonna do this every fucking single time first.
[207:19.66]One and then two.
[207:20.42]I'm gonna get it every time.
[207:31.97]Fucking Grinch.
[207:54.03]Watch this.
[208:01.89]Oh.
[208:03.25]I wonder.
[208:04.79]I wonder if it's going to be Parkinson's every time.
[208:14.78]This can't be a dice roll here.
[208:17.12]It can't be.
[208:25.21]He's coming back.
[208:31.75]Look, he's old.
[208:32.55]It's Parkinson's.
[208:39.00]Here we go.
[208:46.54]Run the test.
[208:48.84]Get it out of the way immediately.
[208:55.03]Why do I have to still play as the Grinch?
[208:56.85]I don't want to play as the Grinch anymore.
[208:58.25]That's correct.
[209:00.23]Parkinson's.
[209:02.03]Oh!
[209:03.05]Look at that!
[209:05.84]You know what else?
[209:06.50]I wonder if he's stressed.
[209:17.46]Don't be mean to the Grinch.
[209:23.67]I'm going to treat this immediately.
[209:26.30]I don't want to do this again.
[209:36.95]Rewind to Hitler.
[209:38.73]No.
[209:39.26]God.
[209:43.10]I'm just going to get it out of the way.
[209:45.18]It's insanely expensive.
[209:46.46]Just get it out of the way.
[209:47.42]So you don't have to worry about it for the rest of the time you plan.
[210:02.52]Come on.
[210:05.26]Now get out of here.
[210:07.90]By the way, it's only a 70% efficient treatment.
[210:10.62]If I lose this.
[210:12.47]Alright, now we're good to go.
[210:14.03]Now let's begin the game.
[210:16.59]We got joint pain.
[210:19.61]Let's take a look.
[210:20.15]This is very painful right now.
[210:22.41]We got arthritis.
[210:24.85]I'm going to try this too.
[210:26.17]Because look, we got... We can do a bone biopsy here and we can try to get these two knocked out of the park here.
[210:33.09]That's what we're going for.
[210:39.17]What am I looking at here?
[210:44.33]Especially it's Christmas themed to... Where's the Easter Bunny?
[210:57.02]Circulation is bad.
[210:58.14]Immune system is bad.
[210:59.50]All of it's bad.
[211:00.14]Everything's bad.
[211:06.83]Come on.
[211:08.36]Please.
[211:13.30]One more.
[211:21.02]Get them both.
[211:23.47]Biomap.
[211:24.23]Alright, here we go.
[211:24.81]I'm going to do a bone biopsy and run the test.
[211:29.73]These two were potential for a large amount of pain and suffering we have here.
[211:33.85]Let's try to take care of it.
[211:38.84]I'm going to do another test right now.
[211:40.20]Let's see what else we got.
[211:47.59]We got headaches.
[211:49.99]Dizziness.
[211:51.75]Let's just go.
[211:53.01]Stress.
[211:55.09]Mood swings.
[211:56.05]Psychological examination.
[211:57.23]No, just do stress.
[211:58.05]It's stress every time.
[211:59.35]Stress is the other every time.
[212:02.33]And we'll just do a psychological evaluation just for fun.
[212:12.21]There we go.
[212:13.37]There it is.
[212:13.71]It's stress.
[212:14.53]Again.
[212:15.97]Of course it is.
[212:16.45]Is it the bone problems too?
[212:23.98]No.
[212:26.66]But I do have stress.
[212:27.38]Let's treat the stress right now.
[212:38.73]This is only bad.
[212:39.39]It's 100%.
[212:42.75]So here we go.
[212:43.13]Still got the fatigue.
[212:45.29]Still got the joint pain.
[212:46.33]Let's see what we got.
[212:50.77]Lupus?
[212:51.27]It's gonna be Lupus again.
[212:55.41]Yeah.
[212:57.83]It's always never Lupus unless it's this game.
[213:03.64]And we got Nervous Breakdown.
[213:08.16]So we got 80% efficiency six days.
[213:14.01]I can upgrade now.
[213:14.65]Did I actually miss that?
[213:21.29]That was three points.
[213:22.61]Oh, god damn it.
[213:31.50]111 days.
[213:34.82]Play Teardrop.
[213:35.68]I know that would make sense.
[213:47.84]treat it go five points fatigue joint pain it's definitely lupus 12 points but can I do anything else in the meantime nausea leg pain nausea leg pain dizziness high cholesterol let's give it a test it's quick and it's easy
[214:17.46]Still got plenty of time.
[214:18.44]He's fairly healthy.
[214:27.77]No, no, no!
[214:28.71]It is... Okay, you got high cholesterol, but I don't care.
[214:30.67]Not yet.
[214:31.57]I gotta pick this up.
[214:34.77]High cholesterol.
[214:40.25]Why am I still calling this you guys?
[214:43.56]It hasn't been Twitch chat in like three levels.
[214:47.46]Alright, so let's treat the high cholesterol with... It's 70%.
[214:53.04]It should be fine.
[214:59.70]Circulatory is still an issue.
[215:04.62]Strict diet.
[215:12.29]Five.
[215:12.99]Come on, give me.
[215:14.99]Alright, what do we got left?
[215:18.41]Still problems with fatigue.
[215:20.43]Still joint pain.
[215:21.51]It was lupus, right?
[215:23.19]Yes.
[215:24.61]I need 12 points.
[215:33.57]Come on!
[215:38.03]One more point and we can prove again that it's always the same diseases.
[215:47.52]lupus test doesn't take the 90 but takes the 70 yeah but it was two extra points you're gonna be fine watch is it gonna pass bingo ding dong high cholesterol solved it's and it's not only is it lupus it's photosensitivity again
[216:15.51]so now like okay I can treat it high cholesterol treated good I can upgrade again here we go I think this is this is a victory here even if he goes into cardiac arrest I should be able to do it within the time frame
[216:44.28]Because there isn't very many things to do now.
[216:46.58]So that's curing lupus.
[216:49.40]How much is the lupus cure?
[216:50.34]That's a 40%.
[216:53.34]Holy god, that's awful.
[216:54.59]Okay, I need 11.
[216:55.01]I don't want to run out of days.
[217:05.12]Come on.
[217:16.66]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know, I know.
[217:19.58]You know what?
[217:20.02]Hold on a minute.
[217:23.24]We gotta do a heart transplant first.
[217:26.34]I ain't gonna fucking ruin this.
[217:32.48]Come on!
[217:33.12]Go!
[217:33.38]Alright, we're safe.
[217:47.81]Upgrade one last time.
[217:48.81]No.
[217:53.03]He's now out of the hospital.
[217:58.39]Now we do the Lupus Cure.
[217:59.50]43 days left!
[218:01.32]God damn it!
[218:05.42]This sucks.
[218:11.09]27 days.
[218:11.72]80% chance.
[218:14.76]Now what do we got?
[218:16.00]The last thing we have here is we have fatigue and leg pain.
[218:25.07]Leg pain.
[218:26.13]Oh, fuck.
[218:28.43]What do we got here?
[218:29.41]We got nervous system, circulatory, everything else is terrible.
[218:32.23]Not skeletal anymore.
[218:40.30]Let's do a test here.
[218:41.24]So we got fatigue.
[218:42.12]None of these are matching up.
[218:46.84]Shit.
[218:47.38]It could be fucking anything.
[218:50.99]Well, let's see if I can do a ultrasound.
[218:53.99]Hopefully grab this one.
[219:08.21]Please, that would be right.
[219:09.55]Yes, blood clots.
[219:12.87]Treat it right now.
[219:16.95]This is where the problem's gonna lie, because this is anything.
[219:21.53]It's actually anything.
[219:25.40]Fatigue, it's, uh, this is, I'm gonna fucking lose.
[219:29.14]It's not connected to anything else.
[219:31.48]This is five, six, seven, eight.
[219:34.64]Which one is it?
[219:35.34]Is it circulatory?
[219:37.40]Nervous system?
[219:38.06]I have no idea.
[219:42.17]It could be anything.
[219:48.57]Shit.
[219:50.61]What's the worst right now?
[220:05.77]Here we go.
[220:06.29]If he's stressed out and he has a nervous breakdown, then he definitely comes... It's gonna be depression.
[220:11.69]I only have 22 days to get this done.
[220:14.14]If it's not this, I have one more chance.
[220:15.92]And then I lose.
[220:19.06]Let's see if it was correct.
[220:30.19]Lupus is cured.
[220:40.65]I don't know.
[220:43.50]I don't know.
[220:44.02]Is it Burnout?
[220:47.86]Angia, Burnout, or one of these.
[220:50.15]This is the last chance we have.
[220:55.91]Burnout?
[221:08.50]Can I do these both at the same time?
[221:09.84]How long does the diagnosis take for this?
[221:13.20]Do I have enough to do both?
[221:15.00]Okay.
[221:15.46]Psychological evaluation.
[221:16.70]Do it.
[221:17.38]And we'll try to do if it's the... Okay.
[221:19.90]Here we go.
[221:22.93]Wait.
[221:23.05]Anything else we can do?
[221:24.31]For fatigue.
[221:24.85]Because I'm doing... I've got these researching right now.
[221:28.19]What do we got?
[221:28.99]This is the other one that I was thinking.
[221:31.29]Any... Any... Angina.
[221:32.73]Angina.
[221:34.91]Angina.
[221:38.63]Come on.
[221:40.13]12 days.
[221:45.59]And?
[221:46.59]Fuck.
[221:48.23]No, stay back.
[221:55.22]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[221:57.40]Please don't have it be more than five.
[221:58.86]Come on!
[221:59.98]How long does this take?
[222:00.84]Ugh.
[222:10.40]That's game over.
[222:13.38]It's definitely not this.
[222:15.08]It's probably banana.
[222:16.28]Potassium land.
[222:19.25]Potassium deficiency.
[222:23.05]Three days.
[222:23.55]Two days, though.
[222:31.32]He died.
[222:50.47]No, I'm not doing any more memes.
[223:00.08]I should have had this one.
[223:00.96]A long time ago.
[223:03.32]The game crashed when I had the perfect roll.
[223:17.11]Alright, I'm going to give this one more attempt.
[223:22.34]Let's take a look.
[223:23.84]Muscle weakness.
[223:25.22]Loss of reflexes.
[223:46.93]sure are making it interesting let's do the test of distress it's going to be stressed too stress chronic stress
[224:17.75]Interesting.
[224:22.51]Parkinson's lupus stress.
[224:27.70]I don't think it's lupus this time.
[224:31.80]Although, you know, it's probably asthma again, though.
[224:33.54]I need more points.
[224:39.49]Can you give a quick rundown on how to play the game?
[224:41.15]Essentially, it's micromanaging every part of the person's internal body.
[224:48.45]And you have to spend money to... There's two games, pretty much, essentially.
[224:52.21]There's two video games here.
[224:54.25]That's... No, that's... Wow, that's too long.
[224:58.03]Uh, the first video game is... Make sure... Guy stays alive.
[225:02.91]The second video game is make sure Guy dies.
[225:04.65]Can you explain how DNA works to me?
[225:15.56]No.
[225:22.12]I wonder if I should just do... The whole nine here.
[225:33.37]Nah, just do the big one.
[225:34.93]Do the big test.
[225:38.62]Cover all the bases in the... Just do a full MRI.
[225:57.24]Money!
[225:58.18]Thanks for the money!
[226:00.90]Who is that?
[226:02.86]Chubby is thread.
[226:03.46]Thanks for the $25, dude.
[226:05.22]Look, Parkinson's.
[226:05.90]Cool.
[226:06.34]Again.
[226:09.46]You have to get that started.
[226:10.54]It's 27 days.
[226:17.44]What did you say?
[226:18.04]You didn't say anything, actually.
[226:19.28]You just said, hey, thanks for the $25.
[226:20.46]Appreciate it, man.
[226:25.65]What does DNA have to do with balding?
[226:27.11]Uh, quite a, quite a bit.
[226:31.18]Did you guys know that... I hate how this is only a 70, but that's such, that's such awful, just 30 days and 70%.
[226:46.24]If it just doesn't work, then I lose.
[226:47.36]I have to restart.
[226:49.41]Now we have paranoia, skin rash, anxiety, shortness of breath, dizziness, fatigue.
[226:56.23]Well, that points to nervous breakdown.
[227:10.55]Funny joke voice.
[227:17.03]Come on, give me some slack.
[227:19.13]Come on.
[227:19.87]I don't do that that often.
[227:21.51]I only do the funny joke voice like once a stream.
[227:25.07]Not even.
[227:26.15]Maybe like once every couple weeks.
[227:35.20]Oh, let's see.
[227:35.74]Nervous breakdown.
[227:36.68]Do the evaluation.
[227:48.10]Yeah, he almost has a perfect digestive system.
[227:51.92]It's just going to be nervous system and muscular at this point.
[227:56.74]May have lucked out with this.
[227:58.52]So, that's a good thing.
[228:05.52]God damn it, I missed.
[228:07.94]Nervous breakdown.
[228:11.34]I have the funds.
[228:12.88]Treat it.
[228:13.16]80% efficiency.
[228:18.22]God, it's so long, but I want to be sure.
[228:20.47]Let's upgrade my guy.
[228:25.75]Alright, we got Parkinson's.
[228:32.62]We got the nervous breakdown taken care of.
[228:34.62]Let's see what else we can do here.
[228:36.96]Paranoia.
[228:38.99]Fatigue.
[228:40.35]Dizziness.
[228:46.35]I mean, let's go for a little screening here.
[228:50.61]Does anything else encompass this?
[228:54.54]No.
[228:54.98]Just do the screening for the exercise test.
[228:59.88]See if that's it.
[229:07.17]Nope.
[229:07.61]Okay.
[229:08.11]Well, that rules that out.
[229:10.13]Paranoia.
[229:12.07]Shortness of breath.
[229:12.89]Skin rash.
[229:14.05]Dizziness.
[229:14.91]Fatigue.
[229:16.41]Paranoia.
[229:17.33]Fatigue.
[229:18.29]Paranoia.
[229:19.35]Fatigue.
[229:19.91]Sleepy boy!
[229:21.47]Chronic fatigue.
[229:26.56]I get a feeling that's what it is.
[229:27.58]This one's going a lot better than the last ones.
[229:34.74]Let's just hope I can get them all done.
[229:37.28]In the allotted time frame.
[229:43.50]What else?
[229:44.52]Shortness of breath.
[229:46.50]Skin rash.
[229:48.72]Better not be lupus.
[229:50.74]Skin rash.
[229:56.67]I'm doing it.
[230:12.63]It might have been a mistake, but I'm doing it.
[230:14.19]It's not chronic fatigue?
[230:17.99]Really?
[230:21.20]So it has to be... It has to be dementia.
[230:31.58]Let's try it.
[230:32.12]I mean, it has to be.
[230:33.98]That's the only other thing it can be.
[230:40.40]Alright, what's the cheapest one to do?
[230:42.48]This one.
[230:46.55]Diver's Breakdown is done.
[230:56.05]Not, it's not Skin Cancer, okay.
[230:57.89]Skin Rash.
[230:58.67]So that means it's either... This is a 29%.
[231:03.22]It has to be this.
[231:05.62]Jesus.
[231:08.04]Surgical Exploration?
[231:16.33]I don't have enough to afford that.
[231:27.90]Skin rash.
[231:28.68]Okay, surgical exploration.
[231:30.60]Apparently that's what we're doing.
[231:36.18]Dementia.
[231:36.76]It's dementia.
[231:37.68]Yeah, I know.
[231:39.10]What's the treatment here?
[231:39.86]I need eight.
[231:45.04]His digestion is great.
[231:52.63]What?
[231:52.83]It's fucking photosensitivity.
[232:06.26]God damn it.
[232:11.56]It's better not be lupus.
[232:12.62]It's not gonna be lupus.
[232:18.87]Fucking photosensitivity.
[232:20.35]It's gonna be photosensitivity.
[232:29.17]78 days.
[232:34.76]Six.
[232:45.46]Jupiter lupus.
[232:51.64]I need to do some diagnostic, come on.
[232:59.36]Is this six or is this eight?
[233:00.42]That's eight.
[233:03.19]Well, treat this.
[233:03.99]I'm running out of time again.
[233:07.37]This is, this is, this game's fucking hard.
[233:14.03]Somebody's just over my shoulder with a stopwatch while I roll dice.
[233:36.24]Being a doctor ain't easy.
[233:37.36]No, apparently not.
[233:38.48]I mean, this one shows up a couple of times here.
[233:50.95]So does this.
[234:01.51]Can I do like a big one?
[234:02.41]I'm just doing ultrasound.
[234:06.40]I'm going to have to give him a new brain.
[234:08.14]I'm running out of days.
[234:18.35]No, it's not Lupus.
[234:27.85]It's going to be one of these up here.
[234:35.61]Maybe not.
[234:36.29]Maybe it's just asthma.
[234:50.74]Alright.
[234:51.80]Treat the dementia.
[234:53.58]I am trying to... Sorry, but I threw too many dice in the air.
[235:05.68]Look, doctors don't roll dice.
[235:09.70]Yeah, they do.
[235:11.18]All the time.
[235:16.54]And now I'm going to do intensive care.
[235:18.72]I'm only at five out of eight.
[235:25.00]The days go by so fast.
[235:30.54]This is on the moderate difficulty, too.
[235:33.51]There's two other difficulties higher than this.
[235:36.77]What, you run around like screaming in the doctor's office for like eight days?
[235:40.09]31 days.
[235:55.54]To find the other three diseases that are randomly here somewhere.
[236:01.29]It could be this one.
[236:02.91]But his heart is at 73%.
[236:08.12]94%, like 28% over here.
[236:11.82]Oh God, a hundred bucks.
[236:15.44]It's gonna be asthma.
[236:16.40]It's gonna be asthma and I'm gonna get really fucking mad.
[236:18.89]Cause it's asthma every time.
[236:22.11]Southpaw2913, thank you for the $100, dude.
[236:26.37]I fucking just missed that, shit.
[236:29.27]You are my friend, thank you.
[236:31.51]Thank you, Southpaw, for the $100,000.
[236:38.48]You just bought a new house for me.
[236:40.57]No, thanks a lot, man.
[236:42.73]It's incredibly kind of you.
[236:43.61]That's a lot of fucking money.
[236:46.09]Pray for this guy, Southpaw.
[236:48.31]Because it's gonna be fucking asthma.
[236:55.60]Much love to you, dude.
[236:56.32]Thank you so much.
[236:59.00]I'm running out of days.
[237:06.59]You think I'm gonna be able to diagnose all these in like the next 19 days and do them all?
[237:13.48]Shortness of breath, dizziness, fatigue.
[237:15.34]Like it's gonna be... It's gonna be this.
[237:19.68]It's gonna be fucking angio again too.
[237:23.42]That's five, six, seven.
[237:24.84]I don't even know what the last one is.
[237:30.36]No, it's not.
[237:32.40]Shit.
[237:34.73]I already did these.
[237:37.27]Teague.
[237:37.83]Is it gonna be... Is it potassium?
[237:51.27]I'm actually annoyed by this.
[237:57.48]Too little, too late.
[238:02.06]It's gonna be bananas and asthma.
[238:06.23]We're thinking too big picture here.
[238:07.35]No.
[238:07.75]How many days does asthma take to treat?
[238:17.54]Five?
[238:17.88]I only got four days left.
[238:20.86]It's just like too little too late.
[238:24.26]You have to get lucky and get them... I have to beat this before I turn the stream off.
[238:30.68]I really do.
[238:31.16]I...
[238:32.99]I had it beat.
[238:33.77]That's the problem.
[238:34.29]I had this beat twice.
[238:36.39]And the game fucking crashed the two times I was gonna win.
[238:43.82]I wonder what it's gonna be!
[238:52.30]Why is this every time?
[238:58.97]It's banana asthma.
[239:00.27]We're gonna do a banana panel, and then we're gonna scan his brain.
[239:03.75]It's because you're treating an old person?
[239:16.02]Why does his symptoms change every time?
[239:17.88]He always has Parkinson's?
[239:19.52]What, every old person doesn't have Parkinson's?
[239:27.18]Alright, we're doing the banana test right now.
[239:30.73]Where is it?
[239:34.19]Banana test.
[239:35.35]Run it.
[239:36.55]Immediately.
[239:55.66]Fuck.
[239:56.90]Abdominal pain, back pain, headache.
[240:03.82]I don't know.
[240:04.74]It really is just throwing dice in the air.
[240:14.18]Maybe this is the thing where real randomness doesn't seem like randomness.
[240:16.74]That's possible.
[240:27.93]Yeah.
[240:28.97]It's Parkinson's.
[240:29.79]It's the shaking.
[240:30.49]It's
[240:32.71]Like, it's going to be Parkinson's.
[240:37.61]He's old and he has a family.
[240:43.33]Just go for asthma and Parkinson's, like, immediately.
[240:46.13]He's got a lot of nervous system problems, so it's probably a bunch of those.
[240:48.79]There we go.
[240:50.85]Now, don't crash the game.
[240:55.05]Please, let me just, like, deal with this.
[240:57.27]Don't crash my game.
[241:12.33]Here we go.
[241:12.73]Start with the stress.
[241:19.62]That's fine.
[241:20.08]Let's get these out of the way.
[241:33.06]Gamo Crasho.
[241:44.49]Anymore?
[241:44.87]Okay, let's go with... This one's 100%.
[241:50.38]This one's 80%.
[241:51.10]What about this one?
[241:56.92]We need the sure things right now.
[241:58.14]I can't have... We got four here right off the bat that it would be a shame if any of these were to be gone.
[242:04.45]I'm doing the sure thing.
[242:17.03]Okay.
[242:20.61]Is it 12?
[242:21.41]No, it's 14.
[242:22.31]That's seven.
[242:23.09]I hate that.
[242:23.69]100%.
[242:26.11]We need another eight and 14.
[242:37.36]I'm sorry, everyone.
[242:38.39]What happened?
[242:39.37]Why are you apologizing?
[242:40.31]What?
[242:40.43]What happened?
[242:47.85]one more and we'll have half of it done because the nervous system has to be treated it's just going down so fast I'm going to be in the er even though I immediately started treating it no meme what oh that's the guy's name I think I'm gonna do a brain transplant first
[243:20.98]If he dies in here right now, I swear to God.
[243:24.32]I will pee my underwear.
[243:32.52]I don't need to?
[243:33.20]Well, if this gets to zero, the whole thing comes down.
[243:44.99]Come on, couple more.
[243:45.71]See what I'm saying?
[243:48.29]Like, this whole... It's getting to zero.
[243:50.67]I have to do it.
[243:52.31]I'm not going to be able to treat him in time.
[243:59.42]If I do the treatment, I can't... I have to brain... I have to do it.
[244:05.29]Because the treatment is a 70% chance to win, and it takes 20 days.
[244:21.73]Now it's just the whole process starts all over again.
[244:35.44]It's gonna keep decreasing till I treat- I'm just stuck in like a rock and a hard place.
[244:39.50]Because the treatment takes a month to do.
[244:44.28]Why is it still going down that fast?
[244:58.33]I'm mad because I'm bad?
[245:00.99]How does that make any sense?
[245:02.51]There's no solution here.
[245:04.88]What are you talking about?
[245:06.62]Look at it.
[245:07.42]What do I do?
[245:09.58]If this gets to zero, the whole fucking house comes down.
[245:12.60]So I can't let it get to zero.
[245:14.54]So I have to fucking do the brain transplant.
[245:16.98]I can't do the other medicine thing because the medicine thing, it takes the whole, it's stuck.
[245:21.07]I can't do anything.
[245:24.21]What am I supposed to do?
[245:24.99]Because watch this.
[245:30.31]Seraph is mad because he's angry.
[245:31.79]No, it doesn't make any sense.
[245:33.73]Watch.
[245:36.55]Take 20 fucking days.
[245:38.41]See you in a month.
[245:40.43]He's still going to die.
[246:16.40]Treat Parkinson's first, but you need the points to do it.
[246:19.24]It's 14 fucking points.
[246:24.03]I got general awards too?
[246:46.30]you get musical notes what do you what do you get from musical notes well paranoia has to be this you have to have sleepy problems we're on the test
[247:14.56]Why are the muscles dirty?
[247:15.80]He got rid of a fucking tractor.
[247:17.48]I don't know.
[247:17.88]Yeah, he's got musical notes.
[247:24.52]This is four days only.
[247:26.04]Why is it four days to treat cancer, but 20 days to treat Parkinson's?
[247:55.11]14 days.
[247:55.39]Just do the one that's gonna work before I have a goddamn meltdown.
[248:14.44]Stop delaying.
[248:15.38]Lose.
[248:15.70]No, I'm gonna win this one.
[248:17.36]I'm gonna win this one.
[248:18.16]We're coming out on top here.
[248:28.25]What's left?
[248:29.67]Headache.
[248:33.73]Oh, fuck.
[248:34.17]Headache could be, like, anything.
[248:35.19]Fuck.
[248:40.03]I need another... I need more points.
[248:45.70]He's gonna start bringing the whole house down here at 47 days.
[248:48.04]Come on.
[248:56.10]Six, seven, I only have to find this one.
[248:58.22]And that's it.
[248:58.78]He's gonna die, but just bear me out here.
[249:03.04]Bear me out here.
[249:04.32]Just wait a second.
[249:07.62]He's got a headache.
[249:10.27]Look, it's gonna have to be this.
[249:11.61]He's burnt out.
[249:13.31]He's got a headache.
[249:14.49]They're all up here.
[249:24.18]This has been 0-0-0.
[249:26.34]It has to be here.
[249:29.63]He's under a lot of stress.
[249:35.39]Fuck.
[249:41.30]No.
[249:42.04]At this point, it's just a wild fucking guess.
[250:00.72]Wow, you're bad.
[250:02.56]You're just trying to make me be mad because you're saying I'm bad.
[250:05.47]And I have to fucking just... This is stressful.
[250:13.59]I'm trying to get baited into like fucking getting angry here.
[250:16.33]And it's working, okay?
[250:19.02]He probably has like a broken tree twig with an apple on it.
[250:36.86]34 days.
[250:40.94]Don't die.
[250:41.70]Come on.
[250:42.12]Just have this be it.
[250:43.32]No.
[250:50.10]No, please.
[250:53.51]51 versus 58.
[250:54.93]Do you have this disease?
[250:56.17]I need 4 points.
[250:57.45]I need... Somebody told me to do that one.
[251:02.97]Oh my god.
[251:11.74]Can I do something that will do more than one of these?
[251:15.28]OK, this is two.
[251:18.04]I've already done and have not done an MRI.
[251:26.44]Did you try lupus?
[251:27.40]I will pee my pants if it's lupus.
[251:28.98]It's not.
[251:32.10]I'm going to go with these.
[251:36.90]These have all not been tested.
[251:40.50]We're going to go with blood pressure.
[251:42.65]It's the brain one.
[251:43.69]So we're going to do an MRI.
[251:46.77]It's never lupus.
[251:47.67]Piss your pants.
[251:48.47]It's got to be lupus.
[251:49.37]Blood pressure test.
[251:51.73]This is our last opportunity to get this right.
[251:57.22]Hypertension.
[251:57.94]Open it up.
[251:58.92]Treat it.
[251:59.18]100% chance four days.
[252:03.88]Three.
[252:05.18]I win.
[252:07.10]I won.
[252:08.58]I actually did it.
[252:09.22]I actually beat it.
[252:09.98]I beat it.
[252:10.32]It's done.
[252:18.27]Good.
[252:19.99]Wipe the sweat off your brow.
[252:23.21]Oh my god.
[252:24.17]I don't even care.
[252:30.29]Just get me out of there.
[252:33.17]Mad because bad.
[252:36.92]Let me ask you this.
[252:38.20]Let me ask you something.
[252:39.50]Let's turn on the camera for a second.
[252:44.51]Do I have dice down here?
[252:50.13]No.
[252:50.49]We'll do it with a bunch of CDs.
[252:57.48]It's bad.
[252:58.42]He's bad.
[253:00.62]Mad cuz bad.
[253:01.56]Okay, let's look let's let's use that as an as an opportunity to do like a fucking experiment Okay, what I have here.
[253:07.96]I've got I've got a SEGA CD CD.
[253:10.66]I got it's called double switch Family feud and men in black the video game.
[253:16.62]Okay, so watch I'm gonna throw these in the fucking air and I'm not gonna I'm just gonna throw them in the air right not gonna do anything and
[253:25.76]Am I bad if one of these doesn't turn up the right side up?
[253:29.36]Like, let's say it's like that.
[253:30.94]Like, does that make me bad?
[253:32.50]Let's find out.
[253:33.50]Let's see if I can get all three to be face up.
[253:35.16]If one of them's the other way, I must be bad at the video game, huh?
[253:39.70]Oh, shit.
[253:45.05]Two of them were turned upside down.
[253:53.76]That was a biased throw.
[253:56.32]Let's do another sample size.
[253:57.96]No, no, no, don't do this.
[253:59.42]What the fuck?
[253:59.90]I like these games.
[254:02.74]Family Feud's awesome.
[254:03.78]What the fuck?
[254:04.83]Why did you make me do that?
[254:16.82]Stop breaking Family Feud.
[254:28.84]Wait, what is this?
[254:32.10]Oh God, really?
[254:33.00]Oh man, you're going to regret fucking calling me bad.
[254:36.37]Just you wait.
[254:39.15]Just you wait till I fucking figure it out.
[254:40.75]Just you wait.
[254:42.37]Huh?

[254:50.84]You want to get air horned, chat?
[254:53.18]When you guys start calling me names, that's when I just fucking hold this in front of the air horn and make you back up.
[255:09.32]I don't want to do it.
[255:10.16]I really don't want to do it.
[255:20.88]See?
[255:21.56]Isn't that fucking terrifying?
[255:22.80]You backed up into a corner from that.
[255:24.96]You thought it was terrifying.
[255:26.54]How dare you make fun of me?
[255:27.72]God damn it.
[255:38.94]Look like a fucking fool.
[255:50.55]Anyways, let's just take a look and see what we have opened up for ourselves here.
[255:54.75]I need one more star to unlock.
[256:10.44]Local greasy guy.
[256:11.69]I'm not fucking greasy.
[256:20.61]This thing sucks.

[257:05.55]Madka's greasy.
[257:09.45]Oh, that sucked.
[257:12.64]You remind me of the guy from The Shining.
[257:15.10]Hey, don't worry.
[257:15.78]Hey, guys, guess what?
[257:17.00]The game crashed.
[257:18.34]So do I have any of the funny joke items in here?
[257:21.41]Oh, yeah, I do.
[257:23.13]What about this one?
[257:23.71]Have you seen a streamer do this before?
[257:25.75]Yeah, the game crashed.
[257:29.91]It's alright.
[257:30.61]We're ending it right now anyways.
[257:33.01]That's fine.
[257:35.13]Let's move this over here.
[257:36.89]I've got more jokes.
[257:37.67]I've got lots of jokes, guys.
[257:38.99]What the fuck is going on?
[257:47.05]There we go.
[257:49.57]Is it?
[257:49.75]Well, it's locked.
[257:50.41]Why is this locked?
[257:57.79]Ready for this?
[258:04.54]Oh, he's bad.
[258:05.04]Is it bad that you can't?
[258:06.14]Oh, you're blowing up a balloon.
[258:07.18]I can do this shit.
[258:15.01]Watch this.
[258:23.61]Oh yeah, you fucking can't do that I bet.
[258:25.04]Now watch this one, we'll see if we can replicate it.
[258:48.23]Hold on, wait a second.
[258:50.46]It was louder than the horn.
[258:53.46]You know what I was going to do?
[258:54.20]I panicked.
[258:56.62]I couldn't do it.
[258:57.92]I was going to blow this up until it popped.
[258:59.34]And I'm scared of that.
[259:00.58]I'm not kidding.
[259:01.05]I'm fucking actually afraid of that.
[259:02.33]I'm not going to do it.
[259:03.95]I was going to just, boom, have it blow up in my face and be like, whoa.
[259:06.63]But no, I'm not doing that.
[259:14.55]I keep thinking it's going to get in my eye, it's going to pop and go in my eye, and I'm going to be blind forever.
[259:20.37]What if I do this?
[259:20.87]Here, I'll meet you halfway.
[259:27.60]Why am I scared of this balloon?
[259:29.80]Close your eyes?
[259:30.46]No, it's not going to pierce my eyeball.
[259:32.12]I'm actually afraid of that.
[259:39.08]Exhibit A. Exhibit B. I'm scared of this.
[259:45.44]I actually am.
[259:46.43]I'm not kidding.
[259:53.27]I've been afraid of like loud balloon sounds my whole life.
[259:56.35]I'm not kidding.
[260:01.50]I don't like it.
[260:01.84]It's too sudden.
[260:02.36]It's like a snake.
[260:03.88]Balloons of the snake...
[260:14.87]Okay, bye.

[264:02.59]Can't do it.
[264:04.81]Woo!
[264:10.73]Let's do the bits now.
[264:17.43]You're waking up my dog.
[264:18.55]I'm sorry.
[264:21.99]Moving on to the bits.
[264:24.01]Let's move on to the bits.
[264:29.21]There we go.
[264:30.67]Hey, there it is.
[264:34.54]What is happening?
[264:35.12]I don't know.
[264:35.46]I'm just... I'm being fucking insane.
[264:38.80]Sorry.
[264:40.02]Hey, Comcast.
[264:40.66]Customer care.
[264:41.06]Thanks for the three bucks.
[264:42.16]Oh, boy.
[264:42.52]My favorite Monster Rancher streamer is online.
[264:44.40]By the way, we're going to be... Monster Rancher 2... Is a usable screenshot.
[264:51.73]Oh, God.
[264:52.19]We're going to play Monster Rancher 2 next week.
[264:55.79]So, either on Tuesday or Thursday.
[264:59.03]It's going to be...
[265:01.97]Pretty fun.
[265:02.66]I'm looking forward to it.
[265:03.56]I really like that series.
[265:06.16]So, see that on Tuesday.
[265:09.18]Thank you to... But thanks for the three bucks, Comcast.
[265:11.87]Customer care, appreciate it.
[265:12.67]SmokewiseGonja, thanks for the five dollars.
[265:13.97]Hey man, asked this yesterday but didn't catch your answer.
[265:16.55]Will you be playing Ape Escape on PS1 at all?
[265:18.59]I loved that game as a kid.
[265:20.66]Um, no.
[265:22.44]I think PlayStation 1 is going to be done after Monster Rancher 2.
[265:27.52]I have Dino Crisis, and I want to play that Fighter Maker again.
[265:31.72]But I wouldn't even call that a PlayStation 1 stream as much as I'm going to make a bunch of characters off stream and you'll see them for like 20 minutes.
[265:39.96]So, yeah.
[265:43.78]Wait, what?
[265:46.44]That's his name.
[265:47.42]Smokewise Ganja is the guy's name.
[265:55.49]That's the guy's name.
[265:58.15]But probably not.
[265:59.31]There's a lot of classic games.
[266:01.87]There's all kinds of... Metal Gear Solid is a great game, but I don't really want to stream that game.
[266:07.93]I've seen it so many times.
[266:09.05]I've played it through maybe three or four times.
[266:11.09]At this point, it's just sort of... There's a lot of those games that I'm not going to play.
[266:16.93]But thanks, dude.
[266:17.71]Appreciate it.
[266:18.97]Also to Xtome9001.
[266:20.97]Thanks for the bits.
[266:22.07]Here's some pocket change.
[266:23.18]Thanks for the 25 cents, dude.
[266:24.16]Appreciate it.
[266:25.00]Sergeant chicken wing, thanks for the one dollar. This game is very fitting I am bedridden with a serious flu right now with a 39.8 degree fever celsius for all you probably guys wondering watching.
[266:34.00]Watching you kill people with diseases is really helping me, my healing process, BibleThump. Wish you the best, uh drink plenty of uh kitchen soup and you'll be good to go in probably like a few days hopefully.
[266:48.00]Stick! Hey sticks renegade, thanks for the one dollar. If you want to give your victims a disease just show them your hair.
[266:54.00]Mhm.
[266:57.43]Cheers, please watch this vid.
[267:00.89]No this video.
[267:02.07]Oh, I wonder what this video is Then we get over this yesterday what and why did I instantly click a YouTube link that was a mistake Nice awesome
[267:21.12]Thank you to... I love to build it for the 30 cents.
[267:24.62]Hey, man.
[267:25.02]Hey, how you doing?
[267:25.78]Love to build it.
[267:26.28]Thanks for the 30 cents.
[267:27.12]Harmony Accord, thanks for the $1.50.
[267:28.50]Good evening tonight.
[267:29.71]We have a local story of a Twitch streamer.
[267:33.01]Twitch being a website where people stream themselves live playing video games.
[267:36.91]Jeremy Richardson Johnson, also known as Derma985, came out as a clown.
[267:40.87]Live on stream, online chat members were capital D-ing, but supportive.
[267:45.71]More on this story at 9.
[267:47.05]You guys already knew I was a clown.
[267:50.09]What are you talking about?
[267:53.90]Thank you, Lethal Spoon, for the 40 cents.
[267:55.48]Demon Lords of Raxos is watching.
[267:58.27]I'm gonna die on, like, January 23rd.
[267:59.97]I'm scared of that day.
[268:02.41]Uh, thank you, though.
[268:03.05]Thank you to Johnny Bach for the $1.
[268:04.89]Jerma, play Sea of Thieves.
[268:05.85]It's in the cards.
[268:08.17]Ow.
[268:10.55]Yeah.
[268:11.68]I'll be playing that with, uh, at least Etalyx.
[268:14.02]Should be fun.
[268:15.94]I've heard that the game is worth playing for, like, an hour or two.
[268:18.74]And then after, like, a few hours, it's kind of the same thing.
[268:21.12]But it'll be worth playing for a little while.
[268:24.97]We'll see.
[268:26.47]Thank you, Harmony Accord, for the $1.
[268:28.97]Eat.
[268:30.29]And then they say, uh, dirty diaper.
[268:33.15]Alright, Harmony Accord said eat a dirty diaper over the case of five different bits.
[268:37.62]Thanks for like the five bucks here, dude.
[268:39.12]Appreciate it.
[268:41.54]Harmony Accord, thanks again.
[268:43.50]Ben Eldor, thanks for the $25 on top of all the other money you've given.
[268:48.12]But this was the first one you gave, $25.
[268:49.24]Thanks a lot, Ben.
[268:51.51]Welcome back again.
[268:53.82]Um... Judging by your name, I'm gonna assume that you're a big fan of that game, and so am I. I don't think so.
[268:56.92]I got my fill of Bloodborne.
[268:57.78]It's probably my favorite game ever made.
[269:17.18]I don't really want to go back and play it, because I have this weird theory.
[269:20.77]It's the same way I felt about Chrono Trigger, and Mario RPG, and The Neverhood.
[269:27.89]That if you play the game that you love more than, like, more than like 10 times, it starts to get muddy in your brain.
[269:36.87]And I like to go back to play some of my favorite games.
[269:40.23]When enough time has passed that I kind of forget everything that happens and I can slightly remember things and it's still a fun experience.
[269:49.60]Because at this point in Bloodborne, I kind of like know where to go and what to do.
[269:55.52]After a few years go by, after a year or two goes by of not playing it, then you can kind of redo it again.
[270:01.15]I play Chrono Trigger like once every five years and beat it.
[270:06.79]And I'm like, oh, that was awesome.
[270:08.01]I love that game.
[270:09.94]So it's kind of too early for me to want to go back and really play Bloodborne again.
[270:13.23]And it's not that I forget what happens, it's just... The experience is fun again because I hadn't... I haven't just recently had it.
[270:23.77]If that makes any sense.
[270:26.82]But, uh... I look for... The game's free!
[270:30.24]Let me say that first.
[270:31.84]Bloodborne is currently free.
[270:37.02]On PS4.
[270:38.46]If you have PlayStation Plus.
[270:40.15]The game is fucking for free.
[270:42.55]So if you have a PlayStation 4 and you have PlayStation Plus, just go download it if you haven't downloaded it.
[270:48.15]It doesn't cost a... It's free.
[270:51.79]I couldn't believe that.
[270:56.28]Free, isn't it?
[270:56.78]No, it's free.
[271:00.62]As long as you have PlayStation Plus, you can download it.
[271:06.26]Thank you, Harmony Accord, for your dirty diapers.
[271:08.43]Thank you.
[271:09.49]Not yours, but your comment about the dirty diapers.
[271:11.55]Thank you.
[271:12.19]CommandRabbit, thanks for the $1.
[271:13.55]Loud P. Sometimes.
[271:17.83]Thanks, dude.
[271:19.43]We already touched upon it, but Ben Elnor, thank you, Ben, again, for your $50 here.
[271:24.40]Thanks a lot, man.
[271:25.46]You gave a lot of money tonight.
[271:26.64]Again, as you typically do, you are too kind.
[271:32.82]You give me too much money.
[271:34.69]Thank you, Ben.
[271:36.65]Luke88, thanks for the $1.
[271:39.55]Logan BNTN, thanks for the 25 cents, appreciate it.
[271:43.03]Mostly Lost, thanks for the $6.90, just under $7, just shy of the 7.
[271:48.27]Bald obese streamer has unprotected sex twice on stream.
[271:54.15]No, my avatar did.
[271:56.36]That's not me, that's my avatar.
[271:59.30]I'm sitting on my computer here, controlling the avatar.
[272:04.98]But thanks, though, dude.
[272:05.56]Appreciate it.
[272:06.14]Thank you, most of the lost.
[272:07.92]Thank you, SuperSeal, for the $1.
[272:09.50]I didn't come to my favorite streamer... I didn't come to see my favorite streamer die.
[272:15.08]Bible film.
[272:18.24]Thank you, Samuel Sish, for the $1.
[272:20.62]1-23-2019.
[272:21.42]Good knowing you, man.
[272:23.18]Yeah.
[272:23.88]It's been nice knowing you guys.
[272:25.33]That January 23rd is my... Like I told you, is the day when I... I'm not gonna tell anybody where I'm going.
[272:32.47]You know?
[272:34.30]Okay, somebody look it up.
[272:35.06]Does January 23rd, 2019 fall on like a Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday?
[272:39.44]Because I have to stream on that day.
[272:44.46]Am I going to stream?
[272:45.78]That's 7.30pm.
[272:46.50]I'm going to be live on that day, potentially.
[272:48.35]I think it would be kind of a funny stream if it's just me in a dark room with a flashlight just sitting in the corner for three hours.
[273:00.57]Like, maybe a hundred people will get that joke.
[273:05.43]You think you'll have the same schedule?
[273:06.57]That's a good question.
[273:07.45]Probably.
[273:08.13]I don't see why it would change.
[273:09.69]Not anytime soon.
[273:13.21]But thank you, Kilgannon.
[273:14.63]And, well, Ben Elnor, thank you for the $50.
[273:16.15]That's $125.
[273:18.03]$130 there so far.
[273:22.41]In just one evening, Ben.
[273:25.09]Thank you.
[273:26.81]Thank you for the fucking copious amounts of money.
[273:31.15]Kilgannon, thanks for the $1.
[273:32.53]It's lupus.
[273:33.51]It was more than once.
[273:36.04]Thank you, Kilgannon.
[273:36.66]Appreciate it.
[273:38.12]Swiggity-swanky, thanks for the $1.
[273:39.52]I just had the most strangest and unnerving experience not long ago during your stream.
[273:44.15]There was a salesman guy at my door and asked if I wanted to purchase his company's steel windows to upgrade my wooden ones.
[273:50.45]However, it's the middle of the night, and how did he know?
[273:53.45]Even weirder, he knew me by my full name and I've never seen him before, and he implied that if I did not upgrade in the future, someone could break in.
[274:03.02]Can I move in with you?
[274:04.10]Wait, what do you mean?
[274:05.04]Wooden windows?
[274:09.73]This is a real story?
[274:14.07]That's the scariest hard sell I've ever heard, if that's real.
[274:18.32]You might want to let local law enforcement know about that.
[274:25.58]Thank you for the $1, Swiggity Swanky.
[274:27.28]Appreciate it, though.
[274:28.97]Moo means moo, thanks for the one dollar.
[274:30.53]Going from treating mosquitoes to treating humans.
[274:32.45]That's quite a jump.
[274:33.65]You're way out of your element.
[274:34.77]Why don't you quit while you're ahead so we can hear your unpopular opinions on the Nintendo conference?
[274:40.75]Well, okay.
[274:44.07]You want to hear my opinions?
[274:47.95]Let's face it.
[274:53.03]We may as well...
[274:59.12]Hold on.
[275:05.01]Nintendo Conference, let's see.
[275:06.35]Okay, so there it is.
[275:12.41]Well, I'm looking at it right now.
[275:17.41]Okay, that was cool.
[275:20.33]Okay.
[275:20.61]There's Mario.
[275:29.73]He's doing, like, a spin roll.
[275:31.03]He has, like, Sonic's moveset now.
[275:32.35]That's weird.
[275:34.83]Okay.
[275:36.69]Let's face the facts here.
[275:38.84]That was, um... I fucked it up.
[275:41.80]Just get over it.
[275:42.90]It's over.
[275:46.84]Thank you to... Thank you to Nebula Brand for the one dollar times ten.
[275:54.04]Thanks for the ten bucks.
[275:54.76]Hey, Jeremy, you should try out that game, Destroy All Humans.
[275:56.77]I think you'd really like it.
[276:01.64]I've actually never played any of those games.
[276:03.18]There are, like, four of those games.
[276:07.68]Those games are all interesting.
[276:08.58]It's like GTA, but you're an alien, and you have, like, an alien radar gun, and you suck up humans, right?
[276:12.32]Might be fun.
[276:13.66]I'll give it a look.
[276:15.31]Uh, laws are panzers, thanks to the four dollars.
[276:17.47]Uh, +2, they said.
[276:19.97]It's banned.
[276:21.37]Actually, no, it's not.
[276:22.45]It's legal again.
[276:23.07]I forgot.
[276:25.43]Nothing's fucking legal.
[276:27.37]It's all illegal.
[276:30.73]Grand Theft A. God.
[276:35.53]Destroy all humans.
[276:36.43]One and two are great.
[276:37.16]Don't bother with the others.
[276:38.36]Okay.
[276:39.10]Good to know.
[276:40.50]One and two are fantastic.
[276:42.44]Gonna have to play them then.
[276:46.54]Moo means moo.
[276:47.12]Thanks for the $1.
[276:47.94]Recently purchased a loot crate and ended up getting the Black Plague.
[276:51.64]That's a rare one.
[276:52.52]Score.
[276:54.39]Would it be you opened up a crate and there was the actual illness was in there?
[276:58.45]Oh, you're talking about on stream.
[276:59.73]I get you.
[277:00.88]Thank you, though, Moo.
[277:01.46]Appreciate it.
[277:01.92]Sergeant Chickenwing, thanks for the $1.
[277:03.24]How do you feel about North Korea's recent announcement about their nuclear arsenal and, by extension, demilitarizing the possible upcoming meeting between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump?
[277:17.29]We're going to get deep here.
[277:25.54]How do I feel about a demilitarized North Korea?
[277:30.29]That's pretty great.
[277:33.85]I think that's good for everybody.
[277:36.83]But I don't know why you want my opinion on this.
[277:40.81]Do you want the opinion from the guy that just blew up balloons and popped a balloon like a clown on stream?
[277:48.29]Let's get Jerma's political opinion here.
[277:50.32]I just popped a balloon on stream.
[277:54.60]Thank you, Chicken Wing, though.
[277:55.38]Appreciate it.
[277:57.24]KillGannon6, thanks for the $1.
[277:59.42]All beef... Two all-beef patties.
[278:02.46]Lettuce, cheese, chickles.
[278:04.16]Special sauce on an abominable CT scan.
[278:06.18]What the fuck are you talking about?
[278:13.73]Streamer simula... Thank you, SmellyBoy, for the $1.
[278:16.29]Streamer simulates ovarian cancer.
[278:18.33]I'm not simulating anything.
[278:19.53]It's just... I...
[278:23.20]It's just like a medical game.
[278:26.50]I could go for some chickens.
[278:32.97]Smelly Boy.
[278:34.05]Why is your name Smelly Boy?
[278:35.79]Every time I say it, I feel like just weird.
[278:39.90]Mostly lost.
[278:40.52]Thanks for the $1.
[278:41.54]Thanks, Jeremy.
[278:42.06]Now I'm going to fear for my life next time the doctor tells me I have the flu.
[278:46.74]Thank you.
[278:47.44]Appreciate it.
[278:47.94]Thank you, Topac, for the 10 bucks.
[278:49.34]They say that face, that Andy Samberg face that makes you supposed to make the streamer feel bad.
[278:56.56]Thank you for that.
[278:57.02]Thanks for the 10 bucks too, Topac.
[278:58.18]Appreciate it.
[278:59.20]SticksRenegade, thanks for the $1.
[279:00.44]Donate to the Pay for Jeremy's Mortgage Fund.
[279:03.54]Thank you.
[279:04.52]I'll make sure to write that check to the mortgage company.
[279:06.90]Thank you.
[279:08.74]Hey, MostlyLost, thanks for the $1.
[279:10.74]You realize the entire point of mice in the ecosystem is to basically be hawk food.
[279:16.01]Well, I'm sorry, that's not true.
[279:18.65]The point of mice is to have sex every day.
[279:24.11]And two mice make 5,000 mice.
[279:26.98]And then those mice shit all over your house inside your walls.
[279:30.42]Thousands of pieces of little rabbit turds.
[279:33.42]And then they die on your walls and they smell really bad.
[279:37.82]And they eat through your walls.
[279:39.64]That's pretty much what they're... And to be snake food and hawk food.
[279:45.73]But they're cute, though.
[279:49.51]They're very cute.
[279:51.43]Rats are way cooler than mice.
[279:54.36]Mice are really cute.
[279:55.54]Rats are way, way cuter.
[279:57.50]Way more intelligent.
[279:58.70]Way more loving.
[280:00.06]And way cooler.
[280:05.16]So, that's a fact.
[280:06.12]You can look that up.
[280:07.39]Let me Google that for you.
[280:08.33]Let me Google that for you.
[280:13.21]Mostly lost.
[280:13.79]Thank you for the $1.
[280:14.49]That was you that said that.
[280:15.39]Thank you.
[280:15.73]Moo means moo.
[280:16.19]Thanks for the $1.
[280:16.83]Mosquitoes didn't exist until 2002.
[280:17.89]Wait.
[280:20.05]Mosquitoes didn't exist until 2002.
[280:21.39]When the writers of the Disney classic Lilo and Stitch created them for a joke.
[280:28.70]Where the alien is swarmed by a group of irritating insects who's... What are you talking about?
[280:39.76]Mosquitoes didn't exist until Lilo and Stitch?
[280:46.30]This is funny.
[280:47.60]I've never seen Lilo and Stitch from start to finish.
[280:54.70]I've seen the first 15 minutes of Lilo and Stitch maybe 30 times.
[281:04.42]That has been on TV randomly and I'm like, oh, Lilo and Stitch.
[281:07.68]I've never seen this before.
[281:10.01]And then something happens and I don't watch it.
[281:12.46]What happens in the exact... Something has to be in the first 15 minutes that turns me off.
[281:18.66]What is it?
[281:19.98]What happens in the first 10 minutes of that movie that I'm just like, I'm gonna go watch Guy's Grocery Games.
[281:25.78]What's doing that to me?
[281:30.47]It's a great movie, apparently.
[281:37.19]Probably the mosquitoes.
[281:37.89]Hmm.
[281:41.98]Maybe.
[281:44.46]Anyways, thanks a lot, man.
[281:45.52]Thank you to the helping llama for the $1.
[281:47.24]Streamer commands chat not to kill spiders because he secretly is a spider.

[282:08.02]Local streamer loses to Skynet AI at destroying the human race.
[282:18.81]Thanks to the one dollar, the stream successfully cured my stage four terminal ass rabies.
[282:24.79]Oh my fucking god.
[282:28.75]Why do I read these out loud sometimes?
[282:30.35]You know, like, here's the thing.
[282:32.44]Like, I gotta start doing the thing that streamers do, and that's like, just like, don't read these fucked up donations.
[282:39.04]Don't people do that?
[282:39.62]Don't people just skip them?
[282:41.40]I just read that out loud.
[282:47.54]Thank you, Demilkmaster, for the $1.
[282:49.59]Garfield cart.
[282:50.43]Haha, no.
[282:51.93]Not gonna happen.

[282:55.43]These are all actual symptoms from watching Jerma play video games on stream.
[282:59.31]L-U-L.
[282:59.87]Not bad.
[283:02.38]Mad because bad.
[283:03.20]Mad because bad.
[283:04.14]Mad because bad.
[283:08.40]Ugh, I can't believe I just lost.
[283:09.54]Fuck, I'm so angry.
[283:10.52]Mad because bad.
[283:11.42]Mad because bad.
[283:12.36]Mad because bad.
[283:15.73]Thank you, Eeps, for the $5.
[283:18.16]I hope you're having a great day, Jerma, and I hope you see you at PAX East.
[283:20.81]I don't know what days you're going to be going, but I hope at least Friday.
[283:23.55]Love you, Jerma.
[283:24.11]Thank you, Eves.
[283:25.39]Probably see you there.
[283:27.09]Good old PAX.
[283:31.17]SuperSeal, thanks for the 25 cents.
[283:32.77]At first, I didn't like this game, but then I saw the funny meme face.
[283:36.24]And now I'm sold.
[283:36.90]Yeah.
[283:40.84]Thanks, dude.
[283:41.64]Thank you, Samuel Sish, for the three bucks.
[283:44.02]What's your fursona, Jerma?
[283:45.04]It's a frog.
[283:45.60]Has to be.
[283:48.99]He would probably be a frog.
[283:50.97]I'm not talking like Slippy the Toad frog.
[283:53.17]I'm talking... I'm talking like a big frog.
[283:57.97]A huge prince frog.
[284:00.95]Like a huge neck.
[284:03.63]Rich.
[284:05.93]Crown.
[284:14.55]I would be so cool looking.
[284:18.96]Here comes the fan art.
[284:19.80]Yeah, whatever.
[284:21.42]It's alright.
[284:22.94]Moo means moo.
[284:23.50]Thanks for the one dollar.
[284:24.50]Again, thank you.
[284:25.32]Welcome back again, dude.

[284:27.88]The primary symptoms are the removal of his head.
[284:31.11]The fuck?
[284:32.63]Shut the fuck up with that.
[284:35.55]I only have like another fucking... What is today's date?
[284:38.43]I only have like a fucking little while left before we get this shit over with.
[284:43.56]Stop fucking saying these things.
[284:48.58]I will be acquitted of all fucking charges.
[284:51.44]Don't ever believe anything else.
[284:57.62]King of the Pond!
[284:59.08]That's me.
[285:01.63]Hey, Son of Jenova, thanks for the $1.
[285:02.93]You did your best, even though we died.
[285:04.87]For that, I thank you.
[285:05.77]Thanks a lot.
[285:06.39]Appreciate the $1, dude.
[285:08.71]Polly Mac, thanks for the $1.
[285:10.89]Thank you, Polly Mac, for the more than $1.

[285:15.76]Marshmilla666, thanks for the $1.
[285:20.56]Chubbiest Thread, thanks for the $25 here.
[285:22.82]They say Doodle Cheer, $2,500.
[285:24.13]Thanks a lot, man.
[285:29.75]Appreciate the $25.
[285:33.23]That is a... That is an Andrew Jackson and an Abraham Lincoln.
[285:41.28]Side by side.
[285:42.58]In the same spot.
[285:43.76]Thanks, man.
[285:44.18]Thank you, Southpaw, again for the 100 bucks.
[285:46.78]You are friend.
[285:47.40]I hope I am your best fucking friend.
[285:52.19]Thank you, dude.
[285:55.07]That's a lot of money.
[285:57.09]Some of you guys drop huge money.
[285:59.29]All the time, actually.
[286:02.02]It's very, very humbling.
[286:03.84]I can't fucking believe it sometimes.
[286:05.42]Thank you.
[286:08.82]Maxi Kaspersky.
[286:11.29]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[286:13.05]Maxi Kaspersky.
[286:16.75]Like the antivirus.
[286:17.77]Without the S. Hey, Jerma.
[286:19.61]I've been watching your content since your crossover with Kryken.
[286:22.30]And I've been a huge fan ever since.
[286:23.32]I don't have a lot of money to toss around at the moment since I'm between jobs.
[286:26.30]But I thought I'd send you a little something for the time being to show my appreciation.
[286:29.78]Have a good one.
[286:30.86]P.S.
[286:31.84]I was one of the people who donated on your Monster Rancher stream that crashed, and I'll never forgive you for losing my donation.
[286:39.75]Well, um, welcome.
[286:42.23]Maxie, thanks for watching.
[286:44.21]Thanks for sticking around.
[286:45.79]Hopefully you're enjoying yourself.
[286:47.81]Sorry that the stream died and then I lost power for three days.
[286:52.89]I feel terrible that I wasn't able to acknowledge the people that gave money on that stream.
[286:58.75]And you were one of them, so thank you for that.
[287:01.61]And stick around.
[287:03.23]There's more to see.
[287:06.00]Thank you, PollyMac, for the $1.
[287:07.68]SwiftRage.
[287:09.70]I'm not sure what you're mad at, but sorry.
[287:11.56]I apologize in retrospect.
[287:14.08]Fred Flintstone, thanks for the $1.
[287:15.52]You look like a 90s construction worker bully that gets his convertible filled with cement at the end of the movie.
[287:20.14]Haha.
[287:30.28]Moo means moo.
[287:31.00]Thanks for the $1.
[287:31.87]Jerma, please get a haircut.
[287:33.25]You're starting to look like you work in a medieval apothecary.
[287:38.77]Also, no more beep, please.
[287:40.73]Thank you.
[287:48.04]Stormblork.
[287:49.10]Thanks for the $1.
[287:49.94]Brave streamer.
[287:50.70]Appreciate it.
[287:51.20]Thanks, man.
[287:53.14]That's 100.
[287:53.78]Hey Jerma, I just got my new PC.
[287:55.46]I used to have a 2010 PC until last week and finally got a new one.
[288:01.28]Which games would you recommend for me to get?
[288:02.92]Thanks for the great stream today.
[288:04.02]You know what?
[288:04.38]Actually, what I really enjoyed on a brand new PC with like 120 Hertz, great graphics card.
[288:12.02]Uh, Smite.
[288:14.17]Smite was so pretty playing that at the highest settings with like a new graphics card.
[288:18.57]And I don't even play that game anymore.
[288:25.03]So, that was really cool to play.
[288:30.58]Factorio.
[288:35.42]No, Sela, what do you mean Sela?
[288:37.98]Let me go open up my Smite account and see the last time I logged in.
[288:44.72]It was like 2016.
[288:49.64]Alright, alright.
[288:50.16]You want a different one?
[288:50.90]You want a better one?
[288:57.87]Let's see.
[288:58.47]Better one.
[288:58.85]Better one for graphical fidelity.
[289:01.47]At high frame rate.
[289:09.43]GTA V, like Leather's saying, the jacket, that's awesome.
[289:12.69]That is another good one.
[289:16.75]Hitman probably looks really great at Ultra.
[289:20.55]The new Doom.
[289:21.19]The new Doom probably is awesome.
[289:23.11]I couldn't even play Doom at the highest settings.
[289:26.69]Battlefield?
[289:27.35]Oh, Battlefield.
[289:28.13]Yeah, you gotta... You know, just go download Battlefield's demo, because the game's terrible.
[289:32.93]So, go... I'm kidding!
[289:34.25]That's a joke!
[289:34.89]Please, God, don't... I... Please.
[289:39.04]I just said that just to shake you a little bit, so make sure you guys are still paying attention.
[289:51.01]Stardew Valley's another one, yeah.
[289:55.94]Please, look, I can't tell you my real opinions.
[289:59.50]If you guys heard my real opinions, none of you would even come to the stream tomorrow.
[290:04.15]If you guys knew my real opinions, none of you would show up tomorrow.
[290:07.71]There'd be three guys that would show up tomorrow.
[290:09.51]They'd be like, wow, he's just as fucking crazy as me.
[290:13.85]Like, I don't think people should wear shoes.
[290:16.66]Why?
[290:18.76]I think we should all just be bare feet, walking around.
[290:22.04]And we should wear hand shoes.
[290:23.28]Wear gloves.
[290:24.26]Because you know why?
[290:25.28]Guess what?
[290:25.98]You touch so many gross things with your hands every day.
[290:28.41]Why do we not all wear gloves?
[290:30.55]It's backwards.
[290:35.90]We protect the bottoms of our feet.
[290:38.38]We put them in shoes.
[290:39.44]And we leave our hands bare.
[290:41.72]And we wonder how everybody gets sick.
[290:55.19]Not coming tomorrow.
[291:02.76]Stop blowing up balloons.
[291:03.98]I'm like stalling.
[291:07.74]Fuck that.
[291:08.20]I'm out of here.
[291:09.72]Fucking idiot.
[291:14.73]Wash your hands.
[291:15.39]I'm going to be real.
[291:16.19]I'm just fucking around.
[291:17.09]Seriously.
[291:21.76]We protect our feet from the elements and from stuff.
[291:25.26]Well, you wouldn't, you don't walk around with bare feet everywhere.
[291:28.96]So why do we walk around with bare hands everywhere?
[291:32.30]Which is arguably the thing that needs to be protected more than anything else.
[291:37.95]Why don't we wear, why don't we wear like actual gloves?
[291:40.09]Why do people wear gloves every day?
[291:45.15]Hand sanitizer.
[291:50.64]Hurts to walk on rocks and shit.
[291:54.91]Can't use phones.
[291:55.71]No, they have those again.
[291:58.65]Bill Nye could come up with it.
[291:59.77]You know what I mean?
[292:00.19]Like it's a new form of gloves.
[292:02.51]You know those band-aids that you just kind of paint it on?
[292:04.75]It's a painted on band-aid.
[292:06.42]It's like liquid band-aids.
[292:08.40]Why don't they just make liquid band-aids for your hands?
[292:10.90]Like a whole hand liquid band-aid.
[292:15.16]And all of a sudden, now you just have... Like, you know in Batman and Robin, when Batman, it's the pinnacle of the movie, there's a huge, huge, huge climax of the movie when Robin is fighting Poison Ivy.
[292:27.77]Poison Ivy, there's a big scene, big ending scene, and Poison Ivy kisses him.
[292:32.91]And, you know, that's how Poison Ivy kills people.
[292:34.53]She kisses you and you get the poison.
[292:36.43]And all of a sudden, what's this?
[292:37.35]Yoinky, he pulls off those little rubber cement lips, those little liquid band-aid lips, and he's fine.
[292:45.13]We need to do that for our hands.
[292:59.05]You remember that?
[292:59.57]Yeah, see?
[293:00.93]I would hate wearing gloves.
[293:01.93]That's why we need a solution.
[293:04.09]You can't just slather on this greasy, oily hand sanitizer all the time.
[293:11.28]Just wait, I'm gonna come up with an invention.
[293:13.58]And you guys are all gonna be laughing, and then I'm gonna make a trillion dollars.
[293:21.04]That's rubber gloves.
[293:23.54]Here's the thing, though, I really do... I really do wonder how many people here are, like, new.
[293:29.53]Because I think about this sometimes, like, we talk about, and I say, like, just random, just total dog shit, right?
[293:36.52]Somebody may have just clicked on the stream and heard me say that.
[293:39.92]Just like the portion where, for instance, let's rewind.
[293:43.12]Imagine you don't have any idea what this stream is and you see the title and you come to the stream.
[293:47.41]And you click on it.
[293:48.47]Don't know who the fuck I am.
[293:50.83]Why do we have shoes here?
[293:52.07]Why do we have shoes on?
[293:53.93]Why do we have shoes for our hands?
[293:56.05]It's fucking stupid.
[293:58.11]X, click, goodbye.
[294:01.89]I'm not coming back here again.
[294:05.68]Like, seriously.
[294:06.48]That's what I would say.
[294:11.12]See, those are the people that aren't going to come back tomorrow.
[294:13.22]Probably.
[294:16.99]Anyways, let's get back to the bits here.
[294:21.23]You guys were making fun of my appearance?
[294:24.83]Was this before or after you guys were making fun of my appearance?
[294:27.93]It's afterwards.
[294:29.38]Hey, thanks to TechnoToast.
[294:33.46]Jerma, I genuinely love how your hair makes you look like a teenager from a 90s B-movie that may or may not include hackers.
[294:39.23]There's another one!
[294:40.59]Okay, keep going.
[294:41.33]Devlon, thanks for the one dollar.
[294:42.75]Devlon, two million.
[294:44.63]Since acting like an actual clown on stream, you better do a whole stream on helium.
[294:48.75]No, you can, like, die if you take in too much helium.
[294:53.16]If you breathe in helium, you can instantly die.
[294:55.38]Don't do it.
[294:56.14]Don't be funny at a party.
[294:57.18]Don't, like, drink three beers and then do helium and, like, try to impress somebody.
[295:03.70]That's how George Washington died.
[295:06.94]Don't be like that.
[295:11.08]Thank you to Monty the Moose for the $1.
[295:12.70]Hey, thought you might think this is a cool article.
[295:15.37]Ideal use for Jerma is still as a hotel.
[295:20.29]What?
[295:21.71]Oh, that's the name of a hotel somewhere?
[295:27.78]Thanks, dude.
[295:30.28]Um, MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $1.
[295:31.98]Hey, Jerma, love the stream.
[295:32.86]I don't know if you ever got a chance to listen to the tea break.
[295:34.78]I didn't.
[295:35.12]I actually did not.
[295:35.98]Thank you for reminding me.
[295:37.84]Love for you to give it a listen and use it.
[295:39.02]Here's the link.
[295:40.04]Let's listen to it right now.
[295:42.20]Here we go.
[295:44.01]This is by MooMeansMoo.
[295:51.41]I like the intro.
[295:56.24]Starting to build up a little bit.
[296:03.97]This is pretty good.
[296:07.63]It's almost like a little lullaby.
[296:20.98]This is great.
[296:28.19]I can picture me pissing to this song.
[296:30.96]For sure.
[296:38.66]It's very otherworldly.
[296:41.68]Here it is.
[296:46.95]That's very good.
[296:49.87]Nice.
[296:50.45]Very cool.
[296:50.75]Thanks for that mental image.
[296:55.78]What do you think this image is?
[297:01.32]Yeah, I just dump my brewed tea into the toilet.
[297:04.85]And I make a face that's like, oh, yeah.
[297:07.41]Let's give it a try.
[297:08.01]Let's see.
[297:08.33]Alright.
[297:09.86]Alright, guys.
[297:10.40]I'll see you in two seconds.
[297:11.30]I'll be right back.
[297:56.23]Okay, I'm back.
[297:58.29]So, hey, what was the funny thing we did last time?
[298:00.14]Oh, I just fell off the horse.
[298:01.58]Oh, man, let's just try to get back into this here.
[298:03.40]Oh, we got... Now that's really cool.
[298:17.71]I could see myself putting that there.
[298:19.49]Somebody said it's better than just dead silence.
[298:25.61]You fell off the horse.
[298:26.39]Bad.
[298:26.98]Don't.
[298:29.64]Why am I biting latex right now?
[298:32.12]Bad for your teeth.
[298:35.66]But thanks, dude.
[298:39.53]If you want me to use it, if you're okay with me using that, I'll put it on from time to time.
[298:43.07]And by time to time, I mean I'm stealing your content and using it forever.
[298:47.27]Like, I hate that.
[298:51.33]Hey, thanks.
[298:51.93]Thanks for the free thing that I'm going to use on every stream now.
[298:57.48]Now, hold on a minute.
[298:58.08]I'm going to give you a fucking Steam game.
[298:59.36]How about this one?
[298:59.90]How about a free Steam game?
[299:02.34]How does Shovel Knight sound?
[299:08.46]That's such bullshit.
[299:15.63]But... No, if you... I'll use it.
[299:18.49]I would definitely use it.
[299:22.59]He paid me to use it.
[299:23.85]Yeah, I... No.
[299:27.10]That's why he made it.

[300:35.37]Cosmic Moses, thanks to the five bucks, general critical reaction to the character of Dr. Jeremy, we don't say that name, was particularly positive.
[300:44.82]Richard Cox of the Washington Post called him the most electrifying new main character to hit television in years.
[300:50.34]Boston Globe's Lisa Dixon found him fascinatingly unsympathetic, laughingly incompetent, and very, very short.
[300:56.20]Haha, Greg.
[301:01.04]Oh, I'm the character.
[301:05.70]What name?
[301:06.22]Elbertson?

[305:09.66]Thanks for the $1.
[305:10.32]Fun fact, the word for glove in Jerma, handshoe, literally translates to handshoe.

[306:05.25]Mostly lost.
[306:06.03]Thank you for the $1.
[306:07.60]This stream is actually pre-recorded and chat has been lied to all along.
[306:11.86]You know, one day I'm going to do that.
[306:12.96]You don't understand.
[306:13.62]I'm going to pre-record like a full 24-hour stream.
[306:19.32]And I'm going to be like, it's going to be crazy.
[306:21.20]You guys are never going to see it coming.
[306:23.56]I just said it, but whatever.
[306:27.72]Thank you Cosmic Moses again for the five bucks.
[306:29.68]In all seriousness, Jerma, I've been a huge fan for years.
[306:32.50]You're the most entertaining, relatable, and genuine guy I know.
[306:35.59]I'm a pre-med student.
[306:36.97]I told you we got fucking doctors in here.
[306:38.51]I told you.
[306:39.31]Nobody believed me.
[306:41.49]Pre-med student in uni in a neighboring state and happened to suffer from extreme depression and anxiety as well as ADHD and OCD.
[306:48.57]You helped me and many others through so much and your streams often act like cure-alls for me.
[306:53.63]Love you, man.
[306:54.11]Thank you.
[306:54.91]And please don't cut off your hair.
[306:56.29]It looks fabulous.
[306:57.05]Thank you.
[307:00.23]We have fucking such smart people here.
[307:06.16]But that's incredibly kind of you to say.
[307:08.90]Cosmic Moses.
[307:09.52]Appreciate it.
[307:11.54]Good luck to you as a pre-med student.
[307:13.42]That's a lot of work.
[307:16.46]Be the doctor that we need.
[307:18.56]Not the one that I was tonight.
[307:21.76]Good luck to you.
[307:24.16]Take care of yourself.
[307:27.12]Appreciate everything you said.
[307:30.46]And finally, last two.
[307:31.58]Ghoul Clamp, two bucks.

[307:36.25]Oh, sorry, I read it wrong.
[307:37.19]Thank you, Ghoul Champ, for the two bucks.
[307:38.61]Rat Goobers, thanks for the one dollar.
[307:41.25]Dermot's going to commit murder.
[307:43.01]I'm holding in so much pee to hear all these.
[307:44.95]I'm on the verge of death.
[307:47.32]I don't know what that means, but thank you.
[307:50.68]I appreciate it.
[307:53.12]Have a great rest of your evening, guys.
[307:54.94]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[307:55.80]I'm not sure what we're gonna do tomorrow.
[307:57.68]Tomorrow might be like a weird fucked up stream where I don't know what I'm doing and I might just like stream my face for like four hours.
[308:04.93]You might get a weird stream tomorrow.
[308:10.01]Take care, everybody.
[308:11.57]See y'all tomorrow.
[308:13.67]Bye-bye.
