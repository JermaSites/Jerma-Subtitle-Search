[00:00.82]What's up?
[00:02.24]How's everybody doing?
[00:03.08]How are you?
[00:03.93]Good afternoon.
[00:06.21]Here comes illegal movie night.
[00:07.69]Nope, that's not even crap.
[00:08.81]We're gonna go.
[00:09.27]We'll talk about it right now.
[00:11.84]But I should probably wait.
[00:13.28]I've only been live for about 60 seconds.
[00:15.72]You gotta wait for people to come in.
[00:19.65]I'm fucking, I'm excited today.
[00:21.35]I'm full of vitamin D today.
[00:23.33]Can I just be clear?
[00:25.87]The sun was just in my face for like 15 minutes.
[00:30.30]The vitamin D is flowing through my body.
[00:34.20]There was a shade open.
[00:36.96]I just stood there and just let the sun hit me in the face.
[00:38.92]Through the window.
[00:43.84]I feel great.
[00:49.84]We can tell.
[00:54.58]He's a photosynth... He's a photosynthesis streamer?
[01:00.18]That's probably true.
[01:03.28]I'm at the peak, the height of my energy.
[01:07.16]When the sun is at its hottest and at its complete and total apex.
[01:15.61]I definitely, I'm probably made, I'm probably part plant, yeah.
[01:19.03]I'm like 40% human.
[01:22.29]25% dog.
[01:24.23]10% goldfish.
[01:25.46]And then, hi, how are you?
[01:27.32]Good to see you.
[01:29.14]And probably like, I don't know, 18% humidity.
[01:31.84]And then maybe 3 or 4% of a lily or something.
[01:39.33]That makes sense.
[01:40.77]I'm definitely not a cactus, I drink too much water.
[01:48.66]Ow, I gotta move this.
[01:50.10]I gotta move this thing!
[01:51.68]I'm a- and I will!
[01:53.08]I'm gonna get this on like a big- I'm gonna get like a professional streamer hook.
[01:55.99]You know those things that come down?
[01:59.91]Like the old like 1980s radio stations, the thing that hangs down in front of people's faces?
[02:04.15]I'm gonna get one of those.
[02:06.27]So I never like elbow you in the head ever again.
[02:12.68]I can't believe you won't finish Beautiful Joe.
[02:15.88]It's alright.
[02:17.36]You take your losses and you take your wins.
[02:21.02]Beautiful Joe was a loss for me.
[02:24.85]It's okay.
[02:27.63]I have the second one too.
[02:29.03]I was like, people are gonna love this.
[02:30.95]People are gonna love Beautiful Joe, man.
[02:32.91]Beautiful Joe 1.
[02:33.59]I got Beautiful Joe 2.
[02:34.59]People are gonna be clamoring for this.
[02:38.01]They can't wait for Beautiful Joe 2.
[02:41.41]I got 40 minutes into Beautiful Joe 1.
[02:47.78]And it was like you guys would... You guys would have beaten up by it.
[02:53.99]And I keep talking about this too.
[02:57.13]I keep talking about Viewtiful Joe.
[02:59.17]This is like day three in a row.
[03:00.95]Where I've talked about Viewtiful Joe.
[03:03.63]So this is it.
[03:05.29]We're not going to talk about Viewtiful Joe anymore.
[03:07.14]This is where it ends.
[03:07.94]It's okay.
[03:09.74]But let's go over what's going to happen next week.
[03:13.30]I've got a plan for next week.
[03:14.86]We've got the whole thing locked out.
[03:16.52]Are you ready?
[03:18.25]So starting on Tuesday, Tuesday is going to be the movie night.
[03:22.57]So what's movie night?
[03:23.63]What do you mean?
[03:23.99]What are you talking about?
[03:24.59]We talked last night and a couple nights ago we went over it.
[03:27.78]I was going to try the Twitch Prime movie watch party thing.
[03:33.34]But I looked at it.
[03:35.08]I looked at what was on the watch party.
[03:36.76]And it's like 15 movies.
[03:40.38]And then 40 or 50 Amazon TV shows that they desperately want people to watch.
[03:47.62]Like, uh, like Jack Russell, whatever it was.
[03:50.08]What's that show?
[03:51.42]Jack Russell?
[03:52.00]No, that's a dog.
[03:53.18]Um, what's the show that, like, Amazon wants everybody to watch so bad?
[03:58.19]Jack Ryan, okay.
[03:59.87]Yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna watch Jack Ryan.
[04:01.63]It's like Jack Ryan and then, like, seven movies.
[04:05.55]So until they fill that catalog up with, hopefully, A Bug's Life at some point, we're gonna watch a public domain movie on Tuesday.
[04:15.86]we might even watch two depending on how long they are so Monday is going to be Public Domain Movie Night and there is the watch party on Twitch right now is only for people in the united states you have to have Amazon prime if you know Twitch prime and maybe in the future we'll try it out but I do want to try it eventually but we're going to do public domain movies so tonight
[04:42.47]After Casino Wink, we're going to go back to Casino Wink because I want to play it again because I think it was really fun.
[04:48.97]After we're done with that, after maybe a few hours, we're going to spend a little time.
[04:51.70]We're going to pick some of some of our top picks for public domain movies.
[05:01.39]And that's the plan.
[05:02.39]So Tuesday's Public Domain Movie Night.
[05:05.37]Wednesday is gonna be community content night.
[05:07.66]There we go.
[05:08.84]Future me does not now have to go back and go, what the, oh, I didn't, no, I'm holding future me accountable.
[05:15.16]Wednesday's gonna be community content night.
[05:18.26]Thursday will be mystery game.
[05:19.81]Gonna throw mystery game in there.
[05:22.63]And then Friday, Friday is going to be the Easy Bake Oven stream.
[05:31.24]Hopefully all the things that I need will be available for it.
[05:35.66]That's the plan.
[05:36.28]The plan is to have Friday be the Easy Bake Oven stream.
[05:39.18]If Friday cannot be the Easy Bake Oven stream, if for some reason it's not ready, then it'll just be on Saturday or Sunday.
[05:47.31]Like, it's gonna happen this weekend.
[05:56.11]I'm looking forward to it.
[05:58.77]Why did somebody just say we to do?
[06:00.14]Does that make any sense?
[06:03.14]Oh, because I said the word bake.
[06:05.28]Right, right, right.
[06:08.36]Today is Friday.
[06:10.32]Yeah, I'm talking about, like, for next week.
[06:13.45]Movie night, community content night, mystery game, Easy Bake Oven.
[06:17.77]This is your plan for next week.
[06:20.45]But for now...
[06:22.96]We're going to go back into Casino Inc.
[06:24.26]And the reason why I was going to think about doing a movie after tonight.
[06:28.20]Like, maybe do it tonight.
[06:30.22]But I don't want to rush through Casino Inc.
[06:33.15]I feel like there's at least a few more hours of stuff that I want to see.
[06:35.81]I'm having fun with it.
[06:37.05]I don't want to put this... Oh, I got to hurry the fuck up and get off Casino Inc.
[06:42.17]because we got to watch that movie.
[06:45.09]So Tuesday is going to be the movie.
[06:47.92]Maybe even two.
[06:48.60]We'll find out.
[06:49.28]We'll figure it out tonight.
[06:51.01]So, let's see how much more stuff there is to do in Casino Inc.
[06:58.13]Those of you that missed it, we're going to pick up where we left off.
[07:01.97]I'm going to try to stop the bleeding.
[07:08.66]I'm going to try to stop the never-ending money drain.
[07:13.14]I'm going to try to get a second property, and we're going to make the second property a Chuck E. Cheese.
[07:17.78]Because then I don't have to delete anything.
[07:22.26]I'm going to try.
[07:22.98]So without further ado, let's get started.
[07:32.50]Well, it's not going to be called Chuck E. Cheese.
[07:34.10]It's going to be like a Chuck E. Cheese-styled restaurant.
[07:38.26]There's gonna be arcade games, there's gonna be pizzas, and I'm gonna permanently have a rhino on staff to walk around and be the... Charles E. Rhino, whatever the Chucky's name is.
[07:49.32]It's Chuck E. Cheese.
[07:50.28]It's Charles Cheese.
[07:51.36]That's the name of the rat.
[07:52.58]Of course it is.
[07:53.68]What am I talking about?
[07:57.89]Let's go.
[07:58.21]We have to make sure this is getting captured.
[08:03.43]Doesn't look like it is.
[08:04.17]Let's try this.
[08:04.75]Oh, there it is.
[08:06.43]Alright, so which one of these is right?
[08:09.95]His name is Charles Entertainment Cheese.
[08:12.21]That's so funny.
[08:15.32]Alright, which one?
[08:18.08]This one is 1646.
[08:18.56]This one is 1728.
[08:19.08]No.
[08:19.36]Wait, what?
[08:19.90]How is this February 7th?
[08:21.64]1970?
[08:21.88]Oh, right.
[08:24.36]That's the date in the game.
[08:38.56]Alright, we're not doing the autosave.
[08:40.26]We're going to do it from here.
[08:41.29]We're going to see where we were.
[08:42.03]There's a clown convention coming in.
[08:49.86]The window is too big.
[08:50.82]Hold that thought.
[08:51.90]Let me fix it.
[08:52.74]There you go.
[08:55.27]Alright, so where we left off was there was a problem.
[08:58.91]I had a problem with one of my chefs.
[09:01.03]I got rid of him.
[09:02.43]He was removed from the company.
[09:04.91]The doorman, there was a problem with the doorman.
[09:06.75]He was also removed from the company.
[09:08.83]And then we ended up here.
[09:10.81]Okay.
[09:12.78]No, it is no longer a puke casino.
[09:14.92]It's actually fairly clean.
[09:15.94]But we had a lot of people leave the company recently.
[09:19.33]And there was a restaurant problem.
[09:21.27]Don't ever get into the restaurant business.
[09:23.33]It's just a never-ending hole that you put money into.
[09:26.03]Just don't ever make a restaurant.
[09:28.19]Don't do it.
[09:31.40]Where's the hotel?
[09:32.10]Alright, here we go.
[09:34.78]I need $44,000.
[09:38.20]We need to go over our staff.
[09:39.38]This hotel makes a lot of money.
[09:44.24]21,000.
[09:44.34]I got fined twice by the police for having too many prostitutes and then for having too many fights.
[09:50.42]Which I changed that.
[09:51.29]Oh, there's no sound.
[09:53.29]I got it.
[09:55.37]I fixed that by making the drinks not $3.
[09:57.83]That helped, I think.
[10:02.43]So now, let's take a look at our staff.
[10:04.51]What do we need?
[10:09.10]Fuck, I can't collect.
[10:10.08]No, no, no.
[10:11.04]No, I can't do it.
[10:11.94]Just imagine it's there.
[10:13.04]Put it on your screen and look at it over on another window every few minutes.
[10:21.97]Hold on.
[10:22.29]Wait, I can't alt tab right now.
[10:25.29]Just hold on a second.
[10:26.21]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10:31.90]This guy's making $240.
[10:32.62]Do it now.
[10:35.56]I'll do it later when I have a minute.
[10:38.22]Just hold on.
[10:40.31]The hotel's doing fine.
[10:41.25]I need to go down to the second floor.
[10:42.41]We gotta figure out what I want to do here.
[10:43.59]Okay, so... Who needs to stay?
[10:51.60]We have... You guys are still here.
[10:53.34]This is the burger factory and the ice cream factory.
[10:56.85]The bar... There's two bartenders that don't need to be here.
[10:59.93]There's only no... There's nobody here.
[11:02.72]The last thing that happened... Okay, the last thing that happened was... I accidentally... Okay, biker... No clowns?
[11:10.75]Oh, yes, I remember.
[11:11.65]Yeah, I... Garfield accidentally shot one of the technicians.
[11:15.65]Now I remember.
[11:16.15]Okay, so we need a new technician.
[11:20.99]Here's Seinfeld?
[11:22.11]Oh.
[11:25.02]Okay, we need a technician.
[11:26.06]Okay.
[11:28.09]A cheap one.
[11:29.97]You can get to work.
[11:30.93]We only need one.
[11:31.67]There's not very many machines that are really in operation.
[11:34.53]All the waitstaff can go.
[11:35.73]We have to get rid of the waitstaff.
[11:41.71]We do.
[11:42.73]There's no restaurant.
[11:44.37]There's nobody here.
[11:46.35]We have to wait until people actually start coming back to the casino.
[11:51.07]Just get rid of all the hookers that come in.
[11:55.72]Do I have any other bouncers?
[11:57.74]I don't think I do.
[12:00.35]I don't.
[12:00.69]Just get rid of... Okay, you.
[12:01.59]Evict.
[12:03.39]Don't shoot him.
[12:04.69]Just get rid of him.
[12:05.57]Eject.
[12:09.61]Every time I shoot somebody, I lose an hour of progress.
[12:13.59]Okay, people are starting to come back.
[12:20.26]We're not going to do that anymore.
[12:21.86]We're going to slowly build our empire back up.
[12:25.18]So, like, I make money, and then I'm gonna make a Chuck E. Cheese.
[12:28.07]It's gonna be slots and lanes, too.
[12:32.67]And there's no slot machines in the whole place.
[12:37.67]Okay, looking alright so far.
[12:39.07]Now, what else do we need?
[12:40.16]Let me look at the staff menu again.
[12:43.86]Cashier wants more money.
[12:45.00]Where are you?
[12:47.56]Up here with the sports betting.
[12:49.00]Um...
[12:51.13]City average is 36 bucks.
[12:54.13]Should I really give this person, like, five times what the city's average is?
[13:00.81]Just get... No.
[13:02.16]Get out of here.
[13:05.76]This is the dealer.
[13:06.78]You want five times... You want, like, at least twice double what everybody... You're a five-star dealer.
[13:12.38]I have to keep you around.
[13:14.96]I have to keep the five-star dealer around.
[13:20.84]Don't shoot him.
[13:21.66]Oh yeah, right.
[13:22.24]I shot him last time.
[13:23.70]Just don't shoot him.
[13:25.42]Just get rid of him.
[13:27.23]I know they're asking for a raise.
[13:28.33]Don't shoot him.
[13:29.79]We have a second chance here.
[13:32.11]Just fire Detective Kirby, whatever his name is.
[13:35.77]Goodbye.
[13:36.33]You're no longer working for the company.
[13:37.65]The doorman's not happy either.
[13:38.83]$95.
[13:38.85]Bouncer is done.
[13:40.63]I'm doing it right now.
[13:46.00]And then we'll give a bonus to everybody who gets a bonus.
[13:48.72]All of you.
[13:49.76]Of two dollars.
[13:51.54]That's enough.
[13:53.20]Now let's go.
[13:57.36]No, I'm not going to blast him.
[14:01.33]We need to build our customers back up.
[14:04.85]Alright, this wall is fucking with everybody's brains apparently.
[14:08.91]Okay, just delete it.
[14:10.25]No one's even using it anyways.
[14:15.26]We can have something else over here.
[14:17.16]You know, this is more room for gambling.
[14:18.78]Yeah, get rid of these tables.
[14:20.10]I'm sorry, the whole waitstaff has to go.
[14:21.36]Where are you going?
[14:26.88]I don't have enough money.
[14:28.87]I have to go.
[14:29.25]No more waitstaff.
[14:36.65]I know, I know, I know the person... Okay, so the person making $270...
[14:43.09]quadruple what everybody else is making.
[14:45.57]Sees somebody gets fired and goes, oh no, oh no, you just fired that person, therefore you freed up more money to pay me.
[14:53.98]Are you fucking kidding me?
[15:00.14]Unbelievable.
[15:05.04]I know you're a five-star dealer, but there has to be somebody at the table.
[15:12.30]Alright, it's alright.
[15:12.94]Ike is gonna be losing.
[15:14.68]Alright, 290 bucks.
[15:15.24]That's good.
[15:16.66]Okay.
[15:17.38]Here we are.
[15:18.25]We're doing alright.
[15:20.95]It's not bad now.
[15:22.33]We still have an opportunity.
[15:24.67]So.
[15:26.45]We gotta bring in some more customers.
[15:28.63]I got rid of a lot of overhead here.
[15:31.82]I got 24,000.
[15:34.30]This casino blows.
[15:37.08]Laughing my ass off.
[15:38.74]Yeah, it does.
[15:39.84]Because I had to do... I had to get rid of a bunch of shit.
[15:43.95]Because I had to delete a bunch of stuff because I wasn't making any money and four people were killed.
[15:50.87]Do you understand?
[15:51.59]I'm trying.
[15:53.67]Here we go.
[16:00.86]Sit at this poker table.
[16:01.94]I gotta...
[16:10.87]Come sit over here and play.
[16:16.20]I wish they would keep the noise down.
[16:17.80]How am I supposed to do that?
[16:21.36]Wait, now he's causing a disturbance.
[16:24.96]I was told it was a high class place.
[16:27.13]Because he didn't like the slot machine sounds.
[16:29.55]I was told it was a high class place.
[16:32.11]It's pretty awful.
[16:33.53]Staff are asking for a raise.
[16:38.45]Get out.
[16:39.69]No, don't get out.
[16:40.67]Go play one of these slot machines.
[16:42.87]There you go.
[16:43.49]There you go.
[16:44.11]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[16:45.45]Okay, we're good.
[16:50.89]We need the porn theater.
[16:53.45]Oh, we need more staff.
[16:54.83]No, the porn theater's doing just fine.
[16:57.59]30 bucks for a porn video.
[17:00.80]Two trailer trash after enjoying it.
[17:02.42]That's 60 bucks every movie.
[17:06.69]I need some people to work here, though.
[17:09.21]And I need the janitor to come up and clean this fucking mess up.
[17:12.95]Okay.
[17:16.45]Why do you guys want so much money?
[17:20.75]What the fuck?
[17:25.91]Oh my god, you guys are bleeding me.
[17:28.84]Here, everyone take a bonus of five dollars.
[17:30.32]Everyone's pay just increased.
[17:31.70]Alright.
[17:34.66]Inflation?
[17:35.28]It's been one day.
[17:38.72]What do you mean inflation?
[17:40.98]It's been like 16 hours.
[17:42.76]Alright, I need people to... That's a five star.
[17:50.15]No, no, no, no, no.
[17:52.19]Look, I don't need a five star cashier to have somebody go bowling.
[17:58.62]The sports betting... Alright, alright, good, good, good, good.
[18:01.56]Okay, we got more porn enthusiasts.
[18:04.25]That's good.
[18:05.35]It's the only thing keeping us in the green right now is the porn enthusiasm.
[18:14.85]Now I can start accepting bets up here.
[18:19.15]Wait, do I have any janitors?
[18:26.21]Alright, I have to get some... Okay, and I gotta buy ads.
[18:31.53]I need to buy some more ads, even if they're shitty.

[38:41.73]There's five chefs.
[38:43.99]There's a f- I would never eat at this restaurant.
[38:47.96]Can you imagine eating at Pasta Italiano when there's a fire once every four days?
[38:57.28]This shit better be almost free to eat here.
[39:01.86]This guy's still cooking.
[39:05.18]Wait a minute, why are you still cooking?
[39:10.27]He's still, I've gotta taste the soup.

[40:10.35]Turning up the heat.
[40:11.13]Turning up the heat.
[40:12.71]Fire done.
[40:14.17]That's kind of a very low brain way to say that.
[40:18.09]Fire done.
[40:19.77]Fuck.
[40:26.34]Hotel?
[40:28.08]Look at this.
[40:28.76]Hotels.
[40:29.20]I should just do only hotels.
[40:32.22]$20,000 in profit.
[40:33.48]Are you kidding me?
[40:35.54]I should have just done... I should... Nice.
[40:38.89]$29,000.
[40:39.71]Why should... Why did I make a second floor for the casino?
[40:42.87]Why did I make this hotel?
[40:43.71]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[40:46.13]I'm not losing money.
[40:46.75]I'm up to $30,000.
[40:47.79]Alright, here is the... Here's the moron play.
[40:53.71]The moron play is to just turn floor 2 into a hotel.
[41:01.14]Right?
[41:01.78]Just get rid of all this shit and turn floor two into a hotel.
[41:09.01]That means we lose porn theater, but we might need to.
[41:11.77]Oh, well, guys.
[41:15.99]When I get my third property, we'll eventually just make a porn house.
[41:21.16]We'll just make like a pornographic building.
[41:24.08]With like two porn theaters.
[41:25.34]There's like a porn show.
[41:26.42]I can separate it here.
[41:31.57]Alright, we're just gonna... Okay.
[41:33.04]Time for renovations.
[41:36.10]Sports betting does make a lot of profit, though.
[41:38.66]I'm gonna move this downstairs.
[41:40.48]It's a good spot for it.
[41:41.24]Sports betting does really, really, really well.
[41:43.88]Right here.
[41:44.30]Right in this corner.
[41:44.88]Get rid of the lava lamp.
[41:45.60]Sports betting's going in the corner.
[41:51.65]Save it?
[41:52.57]Good idea.
[41:56.95]Okay.
[42:03.41]Making moves All your profit is from the second floor Yeah, but if I if I have another hotel and I can make this potentially a two-star hotel on top of the one-star hotel which that's I mean I That's kind of a dumb idea, but just have five floors and have floor to be one two and then three and then four star hotel I Mean yeah, they all have to go in the same elevator, but who the fuck here is he but I'm gonna go on the top floor and
[42:33.41]Like, are you really gonna be, I guess, like, the guy that spends $500 a room, that's in, like, the business suit on, on some business trip, is, is he gonna be mad that there's, like, free crackheads in the elevator with him?
[42:45.72]For the room that's, like, $25 a night?

[49:16.64]Put a wall around it.
[49:20.50]Hold on.
[49:25.95]These aren't making any money.
[49:27.85]Just get rid of them.
[49:32.82]It's going in this corner.
[49:38.62]There we go.
[49:39.04]Like that.

[49:58.46]What are you doing with this sports betting?
[50:00.86]You want to... Come here.
[50:05.44]You now work there.
[50:07.36]Oh, there was a spot for her!
[50:08.34]Look!
[50:11.09]Uh, where's she sat?
[50:11.95]Look!

[50:16.29]Okay, let's start running that movie theater again.
[50:18.13]Back to upstairs.
[50:20.55]I want to move these.
[50:25.58]They're fucking ugly and in the way.
[50:28.52]Plus, I don't want this in a way where people can, like, watch that.
[50:32.12]I could also... I should put a wall right here, too.
[50:34.10]Like a... Right?
[50:37.17]Yes.
[50:37.41]Put the beanbag chairs in front of the bar.
[50:48.73]Imagine they have to sit there and just have a... Ugh.
[50:50.81]Alright, let's go to the third... second floor.
[50:55.35]All trash has been removed.
[50:58.14]Uh... Scratch that.
[51:00.18]We gotta remove one more person.
[51:04.06]Go upstairs and eject this hooker.
[51:08.17]And then I'm converting this to a hotel.
[51:09.51]Let's see how expensive this would be.
[51:13.85]Alright, get him out of here, please.
[51:17.69]Just do a bunch of movie theaters.
[51:18.91]No, there's not enough people.
[51:20.90]Get the 44,000 first.
[51:23.44]How much does this cost?
[51:27.55]Just do it first.
[51:29.85]We have a very important decision I need to make.
[51:32.19]Garfield, come on.
[51:33.11]Really?
[51:33.38]He just walked right by you.
[51:34.50]You were in the same elevator.
[51:40.70]Dude, it's starting to fill up.
[51:45.36]Eject.
[51:49.36]And then eject her, too.
[51:55.95]I think she's leaving.
[51:57.11]But, no, she's not.
[51:58.37]Reject.
[52:03.36]Get out.
[52:04.72]Leave.
[52:05.60]The janitor's not really doing a whole lot, but it's okay.
[52:10.70]Go empty, uh, go empty that trash can.
[52:12.52]It's 52% full.
[52:15.99]I need, like, a place to sit down, too.
[52:18.59]I'm gonna put, like, a, I don't know, like, a table?
[52:20.11]A couch or something?
[52:21.27]People, how are people gonna eat?
[52:27.35]This is doing pretty well.
[52:30.53]Travis needs a break.
[52:34.36]He is doing it.
[52:35.26]He is on a break.
[52:37.90]He's on an almost permanent break right now.
[52:40.92]Where are my cheats?
[52:48.04]How happy is everybody there?
[52:49.00]Everyone alright?
[52:49.54]I guess I could use a little bit of a bonus.
[52:52.12]How about $10?
[52:52.44]How about $136 a day?
[52:59.38]Ah, we have a puke.
[53:08.80]How are the drinks doing?
[53:09.78]Good!
[53:10.96]We're starting to fill up.
[53:12.02]People are starting to actually remember that we were the cheaper, nicer, more porn-filled casino than any other casino in the area.
[53:24.03]They're starting to remember now.
[53:31.41]a lot of money.
[53:33.26]Oh, more throwing up.
[53:42.36]Okay, why?
[53:43.72]Is it, how, what's the food?
[53:45.00]Oh, the food is, holy shit!
[53:50.32]I was charging $8 for a $1 hamburger.
[53:53.98]Oh my god!
[53:55.00]Okay, that's why.
[54:01.07]How about the drink?
[54:01.61]The drinks are okay, right?
[54:02.61]Alright, just a little more for that, please.
[54:10.01]Stadium food prices.
[54:15.29]Yeah, I know.
[54:16.73]Are people using this?
[54:19.27]Yeah, kind of.
[54:23.90]Stadium.
[54:28.34]Alright, banking high roller.
[54:29.56]Go play roulette.
[54:33.10]I wish I could sit down and play.
[54:34.44]I wish I could sit down and play at my own casino with my money.
[54:41.10]Check him out.
[54:46.75]44.
[54:49.81]Alright.
[54:50.61]No, I lost it.
[54:51.33]How do I lose $1,000?
[54:52.35]Someone's cheating somewhere.
[54:57.02]Where am I losing this much money? 42,000.
[55:05.49]Okay.
[55:09.25]No, I think somebody's hit a jackpot.
[55:10.35]That's all.
[55:10.69]Yeah, somebody hit a jackpot.
[55:11.71]We're good.
[55:13.61]Okay.
[55:14.19]Good.
[55:15.70]I did it.
[55:16.34]And I didn't have to do anything crazy.
[55:19.64]Let's fast forward a little bit.
[55:23.50]Shit.
[55:24.46]I went down.
[55:26.52]Okay, good.
[55:30.62]That high roller is a cheat.
[55:33.02]I have to keep... Is he cheating?
[55:40.60]He's being watched by the floor man.
[55:42.11]I don't think he's cheating.
[55:49.05]Take a look.
[55:52.17]Watch this, please.
[55:56.49]Are you sure?
[56:00.03]No, no, he's spent a thousand dollars.
[56:03.69]He got a thousand dollars back, I guess.
[56:06.79]I don't think he's cheating.
[56:13.35]We're bumping again.
[56:14.05]This is good.
[56:14.81]This is good news.
[56:17.97]And no floors for people to come mess up.
[56:23.84]I'm gonna drop the price here to 50 bucks.
[56:27.39]Nah, 45.
[56:28.67]$45 a room.
[56:29.86]Let's fill every one of these rooms.
[56:36.72]One of your ads has finished running.
[56:38.02]Alright, I'm out of ads.
[56:40.40]Oh yeah, I'm completely out of ads.
[56:43.66]One of your ads has finished running.
[56:50.15]Stay up over 45, please.
[56:52.29]One of your ads has finished running.
[56:56.84]23 hours.
[56:57.20]We'll be fine.
[56:59.72]Here comes the convention.
[57:01.02]What do hippies like?
[57:02.60]Hippies like expensive drinks or cheap drinks?
[57:04.72]Cheap drinks.
[57:10.37]Cheap drinks and cheap food, right?
[57:20.03]Good.
[57:25.16]What are they like for like betting frequency?
[57:28.06]Jackpot frequency medium.
[57:32.24]Let's change all of our machines to medium.
[57:36.06]Medium jackpot low.
[57:37.12]Let's really, let's go nuts here.
[57:58.63]Return percentage low.
[57:59.83]There's a big convention in town.
[58:05.15]Actually, I'll keep these the way they are.
[58:06.27]Those are fine.
[58:10.80]20 more hours.
[58:11.26]Day above 46.
[58:11.72]Come on.
[58:13.40]Win.
[58:14.56]I almost forgot to say that one.
[58:16.56]Forgot to say that part.
[58:24.26]Why is there a commissioner by the front door?
[58:26.34]This is the doorman.
[58:28.29]He doesn't do anything right now, actually.
[58:29.67]He does nothing.
[58:31.21]In fact, I'm not sure why he's still on payroll.
[58:32.97]Because he's supposed to block certain people from coming in.
[58:35.97]And I have allowed teenagers into the casino.
[58:38.64]So he's just a guy that stands.
[58:39.96]19 hours.
[58:43.28]Here we go. 47...
[58:51.01]Where's the hippies?
[58:52.51]Here they are.
[58:54.76]Here they come.
[58:56.68]Alright, we need extra staff.
[58:58.82]We need staff on duty and on guard at all times here.
[59:07.11]We're about to give hippies really cheap drinks and cheap food.
[59:17.82]They're all checking in.
[59:20.24]Mr. Janitor?
[59:23.14]Get that puke.
[59:28.16]This table's making a lot of money.
[59:33.76]We'll get the other one.
[59:34.38]It's right next to it.
[59:39.56]Here comes the puke casino.
[59:42.94]Wait, hey.
[59:44.64]Wait a minute.
[59:45.82]They all checking into my hotel because it's the cheapest hotel and then leaving to go to the other casinos.
[60:01.31]Uh, well.
[60:02.63]Alright, then I have to... That's fine with me.
[60:04.88]I'll be the hotel.
[60:05.44]I'll be the hotel.
[60:07.76]That's okay.
[60:08.08]Alright.
[60:10.86]More people coming in.
[60:14.95]Porn theater's not doing... Wait, what are hippies like?
[60:18.57]Hippies love porn, don't they?
[60:19.73]Make it cheaper.
[60:23.25]I knew it.
[60:24.23]That's why you're here.
[60:25.09]Get ready.
[60:25.53]Clean it up.
[60:25.89]You might as well puke into his dustbin.
[60:31.09]Come here, come here, come here, come here!
[60:32.71]What are you doing?
[60:34.61]Just puke right into his dustpan.
[60:40.30]Alright.

[60:42.20]Incoming.
[60:43.62]$12.
[60:49.52]You've done that, I can tell, Jerma.
[60:52.88]You think I've puked into a dustpan?
[61:03.61]It would just go everywhere.
[61:04.81]You wouldn't even be able to do that.
[61:05.99]I got a lot of money.
[61:08.99]Look at how much we've turned this around.
[61:11.04]Uh-oh.
[61:11.16]Ma'am, you can't come back here.
[61:17.42]And that's for staff only.
[61:18.62]Evicted.
[61:37.37]And evict this guy too.

[61:58.98]What a great name.
[61:59.76]No, stay.
[62:00.94]Stay.
[62:06.68]Well.
[62:06.90]5,000 in income.
[62:09.17]5,000 in profit.
[62:09.77]That's good.
[62:22.14]Rudy cheetahs.
[62:25.02]Well, should I throw them out?
[62:26.56]Maybe I shouldn't throw them out.
[62:27.70]Because they can just spend a bunch of money.
[62:30.62]Uh-oh.
[62:31.86]Ever since I threw away the two belligerent drunk people, I lost $2,000.
[62:41.42]Alright, two more hours.
[62:51.76]One, two, and that's it.
[62:57.61]Did it.
[62:58.23]Remember how I did this last night?
[63:00.07]I sold every single thing in the casino.
[63:05.67]Alright, I now have two hitmen.
[63:08.07]Here's your fourth objective.
[63:09.97]Our rivals are shaken up.
[63:11.79]We need to purchase real estate.
[63:15.41]That's my new objective is to buy real estate.
[63:19.41]Save the game here.
[63:22.03]I got $50,000.
[63:22.53]I'm in the green.
[63:25.18]Things are going well.
[63:26.74]I can either make a hotel on top of here.
[63:31.52]I... Hmm.
[63:39.93]I could do a five-star hotel right here.
[63:46.31]And that's $225 a night.
[63:46.77]That's only $15,000.
[63:47.09]I'm going for it.
[63:47.43]$225 a night.
[63:47.61]Five-star hotel.
[63:48.11]Look at how nice this is.
[64:15.39]And there's a bathroom in here.
[64:16.27]These ones don't even have bathrooms.
[64:20.84]That's pretty good.
[64:23.90]These ones... These ones are worse than prison cells.
[64:31.10]It's just a bed and a bunch of walls.
[64:32.88]Alright.
[64:37.66]Just wait for the money to start rolling in.
[64:39.42]$225 a night.
[64:42.64]In fact, it's our inaugural opening.
[64:45.62]Make it 2.05.
[64:49.72]Open a new casino.
[64:50.58]Here we go.
[64:52.54]How much money is it?
[64:53.28]What do we have available?
[64:59.95]Okay, we can go Wasteland Manhattan Road.
[65:02.61]Wasteland Boston Road.
[65:07.39]Oh, these are all... This is all, like, this is bad.
[65:10.09]This is all, like, out in the middle of nowhere.
[65:14.57]Quick stop motel.
[65:19.47]Quick stop motels, and I'm gonna put a Chuck E. Cheese over here.
[65:27.39]It's $30,000.
[65:31.73]What else do we got?
[65:35.15]Red light.
[65:36.33]Should I put a Chuck E. Cheese styled kids restaurant next to a red light brothel?
[65:46.15]Oh, yikes.
[65:48.21]As they say.
[65:52.83]No, it's gotta be- what about- lookit, this is a nice place.
[65:57.97]No one's gonna go there!
[66:01.26]Parents will drop them off and then go there.
[66:03.16]That's not how that works.
[66:13.78]Well, I can't... I'm not going to do it yet.
[66:14.98]I don't want to be completely in the... I don't want to be completely in the... I want money.
[66:18.39]Alright, we got two hotels.
[66:24.17]The casino's here.
[66:24.87]Who wants money?
[66:28.51]The doorman does.
[66:29.18]I mean, the doorman that hasn't had to do any work.
[66:32.56]Actually has not had to do anything.
[66:35.92]You don't have to even do anything.
[66:39.64]See you later.
[66:51.01]That frees up some money that I can pay everybody else.
[66:54.67]What do I even need a doorman for?
[66:55.87]I'm not blocking anybody from doing anything.
[66:58.81]Everybody can get a $5 raise now that he's gone.
[67:09.36]What, are you... Ma'am, leave the staff alone, please.
[67:21.79]Leave the staff alone.
[67:22.71]What, do you want to work here?
[67:26.59]Okay.
[67:32.27]Here's the third cashier.
[67:33.39]Mimi Stimmer.
[67:34.69]Okay.
[67:59.44]Okay, yes, we're gonna get you that new trailer.

[68:47.66]I need a new trailer!
[68:54.69]I need a new trailer!
[69:11.65]The visitor you just beat up denied it.

[69:23.78]No, get in!
[69:24.48]She's gonna stop!

[69:59.86]Are they fighting each other?
[70:02.16]Wait, why are they fighting each other?
[70:05.12]Why is he hitting him in the face?
[70:08.28]What the fuck is going on?
[70:13.36]Oh my god, just get rid of her.
[70:16.53]Why do you... Hold on, what?
[70:19.85]Okay, fire somebody.
[70:22.37]I need a new trailer!
[70:30.91]Why are they still doing this?
[70:32.55]I need a new trailer!
[70:41.69]No, no, no.
[70:42.99]I... Ah!
[70:43.17]No, we can't.
[70:44.23]I can't.
[70:51.16]I can't.
[71:13.75]Fuck.
[71:22.63]I need a new trailer!
[71:26.07]I need a new trailer!
[71:38.54]This ain't no firecracker.
[71:50.79]The casino's on fire!
[71:52.45]A moment of your time.
[72:16.16]No, that's not the right image.
[72:19.82]Oh, God.
[72:24.49]I thought it was the right one.
[72:32.95]Where's the image of me standing?
[72:36.09]I saved over it.
[72:37.09]Where is it?
[72:37.58]I'm not having birdie pog.
[72:50.80]Okay, hold on.
[72:51.48]No.
[72:52.56]Oh, this one's disgusting.
[72:55.06]No, no.
[72:55.51]This one's... I don't like this one.
[72:56.79]I don't want this on the screen for more than like three hours.
[72:58.89]No, no, no, no, no.
[73:01.71]No, this one's fucking horrible.
[73:03.21]This is horrible.
[73:05.23]It actually is terrible to look at.
[73:06.67]That hurts to look at.
[73:24.59]Alright, here we go.
[73:41.17]This is only going to stay on for like 20 minutes.
[73:45.15]That's the wrong one.
[73:50.75]Now I have to fire all these bouncers that I hired for no reason.
[73:55.68]Yeah, I... Hold on.
[73:56.66]Is this the right one?
[73:57.42]They're all fucking gross.
[74:20.81]Alright, it didn't crash.
[74:21.47]We're good.
[74:24.11]Alright, now...
[74:26.80]Now, I have to fire these guys and stop this.
[74:28.96]I need a new trailer.
[74:31.26]I need a new trailer.
[74:38.27]I need a new trailer.
[74:43.49]I need to talk to you.
[74:53.76]Just get out of the way.
[74:54.62]They're gonna do this one more time.
[74:56.66]I made five grand today.
[74:59.03]Alright, just let her go back upstairs.
[75:02.59]Just move out of the way.
[75:03.63]I need to fire this.
[75:04.41]No, no, this guy's one of my best sponsors.
[75:07.39]These two have new hires.
[75:08.75]I just hired them to beat up some lady.
[75:12.64]Which is the one that got hit in the face with a wrench?
[75:14.18]Where's my second hitman?
[75:25.68]There he is.
[75:26.02]Okay, we don't need these yet.
[75:32.10]Alright, both of you stop this nonsense.
[75:35.12]Alright, Malvin.
[75:40.35]He's doing this on his own.
[75:49.49]Alright, now go back upstairs.
[75:51.01]No, you're both fired.
[75:53.38]You're both fired.
[75:54.52]Where are you?
[75:54.80]This guy here, you're fired.
[75:56.89]And this bouncer right here, you're also fired.
[75:59.85]Oh shit.
[76:00.43]Okay, now everybody don't- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[76:01.81]Money, money, money, money.
[76:02.81]Look, money, look, money.
[76:03.83]Look, look, look, look, look.
[76:04.75]Money!
[76:05.07]This dealer is almost- This dealer is going to make more money than I will.
[76:14.04]Why are you still down here beating up this lady?
[76:22.29]Are you seriously still feeding up this lady down here?
[76:29.93]Just tell her to leave!
[76:31.05]Okay, 39,000.
[76:42.84]How's the hotel doing?
[76:46.02]Nobody is here.
[76:48.46]Not one person.
[77:01.06]You're gone.
[77:07.40]Imagine seriously continuing to ask for this much money, but this table makes $21,000.
[77:12.34]How much does this table make?
[77:17.33]Okay.
[77:18.03]She's a five-star dealer.
[77:20.17]She makes $367.
[77:20.47]A day.
[77:25.76]This table takes in like $2,500 a day.
[77:31.33]I've gotta keep her around as people come here for this dealer.
[77:34.49]There's a good dealer.
[77:35.53]$50 bonus.
[77:44.48]And that's enough.
[77:45.86]I can't believe I just gave you $50 and you don't even care.
[77:51.74]Holy shit, how much fucking money do you guys want?
[77:57.51]Everybody wants a raise!
[77:59.27]All of you want a raise!
[78:01.37]Ah!
[78:07.07]Don't give weak bonuses?
[78:08.10]That was a $50 bonus!
[78:09.36]Alright, I got 41 grand.
[78:18.76]This needs to start taking in customers.
[78:25.16]This shit's not taking in any customers.
[78:32.59]Alright, I think I'm ready.
[78:33.57]I think this is generating enough money.
[78:37.57]Ban the trailer trash.
[78:43.93]Ban trailer trash, and then people will use it?
[78:48.76]But that's my number one customer base.
[78:52.12]I should make the- I should convert the one up- I shouldn't have done a five star, I should have done a one star.
[79:02.33]Pro mod.
[79:12.28]I need more porn taters.
[79:15.70]I'm doing pretty well.
[79:16.96]I'm making actually pretty decent profit right now.
[79:22.73]Look at this.
[79:23.15]Tater's doing so good.
[79:26.03]It's old people and trailer trash are my number one.
[79:28.65]Alright, I think it's time for me to buy a property.
[79:39.55]Or should I wait till like 60,000?
[79:50.48]We'll clean it up.
[79:52.50]Buy a brothel.
[79:54.90]Get a brothel.
[79:59.11]Bunz Burger Bar.
[80:01.81]So how does this work?
[80:16.44]So there are 12 hookers in the Crypt Casino right now.
[80:23.34]That's $4,000 to do this.
[80:24.00]That's a ton of money.
[80:36.62]I can minus... Take one away from there.
[80:39.94]Where's my casino?
[80:44.98]Slamming slots and lanes.
[80:46.94]Alright, I can either have more hookers come here or get rid of them.
[80:52.01]Send them to Pasta Italiano.
[80:56.33]Should I just send like 10 prostitutes to Pasta Italiano?
[81:03.88]Well, that place is gonna be a mess.
[81:05.42]It burns down every other day, and it's just all prostitutes.
[81:12.39]What is that even gonna do for me?
[81:20.02]Send the hitmen to Pastor Italiano?
[81:23.46]What?
[81:25.52]Why would I?
[81:27.14]Why am I trying to destroy their business?
[81:34.29]Send Hitman... To Pasta Italiano!
[81:43.43]Why would I do that?
[81:51.90]What's the point of sending him to Pasta Italiano?
[81:55.02]What the fuck?
[82:03.19]Okay, go to Pasta Italiano.
[82:13.51]Is this a mob movie?
[82:19.30]I don't understand.
[82:20.04]Send them over there.
[82:26.88]Take them out.
[82:37.89]Where should we send him?
[82:39.59]I know that Ricky the Fuckface spends all of his time at Pasta Italiano.
[82:46.10]We'll send him there.
[82:47.28]He eats lunch every day.
[82:50.60]We all eat lunch every day, but he specifically eats it at Pasta Fuckin' Italiano.
[82:56.88]Wait, what?
[82:57.28]He spotted a cheater.
[82:59.81]That's Trump?
[83:02.27]Alright, it's one step removed from Trump.
[83:05.53]Fine.
[83:07.07]Here's Trump.
[83:07.97]You know, it's me, Donald.
[83:09.19]It's me, Donald Trump.
[83:10.39]And then this is me, Donald the Donald the Don.
[83:15.31]It's one small degree of separation, you know, the fucking guy.
[83:20.36]Get him?
[83:20.94]It's me, Don.
[83:21.92]Alright, it's true.
[83:23.24]Fine, whatever.
[83:25.64]Wait, he arrived at Pasta Italiano.
[83:30.28]What's he doing here?
[83:36.24]Okay, he's in Pasta Italiano.
[83:38.19]For what reason?
[83:40.83]What's his purpose of being in Pasta Italiano?
[84:08.69]Why would I do this?
[84:10.81]Why would I do something like this?
[84:15.23]What's that?
[84:22.17]No!
[84:22.96]This is... I don't want to do that.
[84:24.76]It's just not like a mob movie.
[84:28.78]One of your ads is finished running.
[84:33.64]One of your ads is finished running.
[84:34.94]Hey.
[84:36.52]It looks like there's a...
[84:37.90]I know there's a fight.
[84:39.04]Okay, Henrietta.
[84:40.04]Henrietta, where is this?
[84:52.73]She's putting the cigarette on his face.
[84:56.17]Oh, she's a cheater.
[84:57.45]She's a cheater.
[84:58.20]Get rid of her.
[85:02.52]Nice work.
[85:03.64]She's out.
[85:15.71]Hey, don't put a bomb in the spaghetti.
[85:37.94]I can't.
[85:44.04]I can't.
[85:44.94]I can't even go in here.
[85:49.32]Save the game.
[85:50.03]Hold on.
[85:51.09]Hey.
[85:56.75]Jimmy the fish sends his regards.
[85:59.77]And the fish family.
[86:24.69]Okay, well, that's, uh... Rewind.
[86:31.95]Why am I here?
[86:33.37]Why can I do this?
[86:36.21]Why would I ever come into the Pasta Italiano?
[86:41.45]We'll have to wage war.
[86:45.29]On what?!
[86:49.25]What's the- What am I doing th- Who owns this place?
[86:52.95]This is a competitor?
[86:57.03]No, I got a better idea.
[86:58.81]I got a better idea.
[87:00.13]We're gonna keep, uh, we're gonna keep Frankie the Fish here.
[87:03.83]So I can... There's an Elvis convention coming in.
[87:06.89]We're gonna keep, uh, Frankie the Fish here.
[87:09.77]Because... I'm not gonna have to do anything.
[87:12.91]I will make a casino bet with you here.
[87:16.77]That I don't have to do anything.
[87:18.46]That within the next 20 minutes, this place will be on fucking fire.
[87:23.18]And these people will all be dead.
[87:24.66]And I won't have to do anything.
[87:29.97]In fact, let's just test this theory.
[87:35.13]Let's see how long it takes for a Pasta Italiano to catch fire a seventh or eighth time.
[87:46.42]Police are going to an opponent's place.
[88:23.70]There's a lot of chefs in here.
[88:24.88]Really?
[88:25.74]Hold on, we'll go back.
[88:29.30]Knight's boss is out of business.
[88:30.70]Good, I'm still here.
[88:54.51]Oh my god!
[88:55.41]Just hold on.
[89:13.84]Two days.
[89:14.18]It's been two days.
[89:18.86]It's the end of the day.
[89:20.34]Wages have been paid.
[89:23.70]On the third day.
[89:24.60]Police are going to an opponent's place.
[89:29.28]He's just standing here.
[89:30.56]It's gonna happen.
[89:31.32]This place catches fire fucking twice a week.
[89:33.46]Staff are asking for a raise.
[89:36.71]What the fuck, guys?
[89:37.97]I need a new trailer.
[89:41.15]Just to shut you up.
[89:43.43]I need a new trailer.
[89:44.95]I need a new trailer.
[89:46.93]How many people are in there?
[89:55.84]This place is getting overrun!
[89:58.98]Oh my god, it's getting overrun!
[90:00.68]Is this why?
[90:03.53]They wanted... Wait a minute, what's happening in my casino?
[90:07.91]The people at this Garfield's gonna quit!
[90:13.25]What?
[90:14.93]Wait, wait to stay!
[90:17.27]The competition just bought another property.
[90:27.72]Oh my god, they're everywhere!
[90:33.46]Come on!
[90:45.79]Do it already!
[90:47.50]One of you drop a match!
[91:07.67]I have $62,000, man.
[91:15.50]Alright, one more day, and then I will admit defeat.
[91:18.17]And a clown convention starts in a couple days.
[91:21.07]Perfect timing.
[91:54.01]I didn't have to do shit.
[91:57.19]No, I'm not gonna bomb now.
[92:11.30]I told you, these fucking idiots.
[92:13.85]We're gonna light this place on fire in a few days.
[92:16.89]I told you.
[92:17.57]I told you.
[92:18.87]He's burnt me.
[92:22.87]You just burnt me!
[92:23.71]This place is on fire!
[92:26.01]You just burnt me!
[92:34.24]Who's this guy?
[92:39.30]Police are going to an opponent's place.
[92:41.98]Oh shit!
[92:44.52]Get out!
[92:45.40]Get out!
[92:47.71]Leave!
[92:48.23]Leave the building quick!
[92:49.87]Leave the building quick!
[93:10.66]How did he die?
[93:12.26]Oh, he walked out and there was this police out here.
[93:15.21]I thought I didn't even... I didn't even do anything.
[93:20.51]I didn't do anything.
[93:24.63]I got...
[93:28.39]The thing burnt the place down.
[93:30.01]The lady lit me on fire.
[93:32.79]So I raised my firearm in self-defense from the lady doing it on purpose trying to kill me.
[93:39.66]And then I get shot by that guy.
[93:43.36]Oh.
[93:46.04]I knew it.
[93:46.64]I told you it was going to happen.
[93:48.08]These guys suck.
[93:52.81]Reset it.
[94:00.04]Who do I have left?
[94:01.02]Oh, I still have one.
[94:04.03]I'm good.
[94:04.67]I got Otis.
[94:06.07]Otis is good to go.
[94:06.81]I don't need to correct the timeline.
[94:17.65]I got $62,000.
[94:17.85]I need a new trailer!
[94:27.96]Alright, we're good.
[94:29.46]We're good.
[94:31.26]I got tons of fucking money.
[94:32.28]We can buy a new property.
[94:39.03]Alright, let's make the Chuck E. Cheese.
[94:40.45]Stop saying Chuck E. Cheese.
[94:42.41]It's not what that is.
[94:44.07]Slamming slots to extra lanes.
[94:47.06]I don't know.
[94:47.36]What was it called?
[94:48.02]Slots of cheese.
[94:53.70]Alright, this is still generating fucking cash.
[94:56.80]Good.
[94:57.60]Look at this.
[94:58.84]All I had to do, drop the price even more.
[95:00.18]195.
[95:00.20]Where are the clowns?
[95:01.50]I told you this shit was gonna burn.
[95:05.58]You didn't think it was gonna happen.
[95:08.82]Let's have these people go cheat.
[95:10.70]Toybox Casino.
[95:12.10]Looking for two grand from each one of you.
[95:19.93]Uh, go to the Crypt Casino.
[95:21.09]Two grand from both of you.
[95:22.79]It said $1,500.
[95:26.67]Pretty good.
[95:27.59]I made $624.
[95:28.31]Yes, I know.
[95:29.15]I think somebody's cheating.
[95:34.44]Who's cheating?
[95:35.50]Somebody has to be, right?
[95:45.12]Did I get big bits?
[95:46.16]Oh, shit.
[95:46.96]My thing is fucked up.
[95:47.82]Hold on.
[95:49.38]I'm going to make a new save here.
[95:50.64]This is going to be called... After... Fish.
[96:04.87]Uh, don't crash, don't crash, don't crash.
[96:06.45]Okay.
[96:08.63]We're good.
[96:09.81]I don't think it crashed.
[96:12.41]Uh-oh, we had two...
[96:14.73]Very, very, very big bit donations.
[96:17.23]We had one sixty-nine dollar bit donation.
[96:21.61]Sixty-nine hundred bits from Vilemi.
[96:24.31]Thanks for the sixty-nine fucking dollars.
[96:27.07]That's a lot of money.
[96:28.91]Nice.
[96:29.23]Yeah, okay.
[96:30.73]Uh, Jeremy, why would you send an arsonist to burn down Vinny's restaurant?
[96:36.39]That wasn't Vinny's restaurant.
[96:37.35]What are you talking about?
[96:38.49]That was Pasta Italiano.
[96:43.11]That place just sucks.
[96:45.62]I don't have to do anything.
[96:46.54]They'll just destroy themselves.
[96:51.70]I can't believe he died.
[96:52.72]It's alright.
[96:54.26]The timeline has to stay the same.
[96:59.65]That's not even Vinny's restaurant.
[97:00.77]What are you talking about?
[97:01.57]That's not Vinny's restaurant.
[97:02.71]What does that mean?
[97:05.23]I don't even know what that means.
[97:06.69]He literally doesn't know Vinny.
[97:08.54]What?! !
[97:18.13]It's the Vinesauce restaurant.
[97:21.09]Yeah, I know.
[97:21.61]I know who Vinny is.
[97:22.75]What do you think?
[97:23.15]I just don't know who that is.
[97:24.27]Who's Vinny?
[97:24.85]Who are you talking about?
[97:25.77]Vinny?
[97:27.39]Vinny, like Vinny, Vinny the Cheese?
[97:30.18]Is that Frankie the Fish?
[97:31.82]What do you mean?
[97:32.34]Yeah, mob movies.
[97:36.92]Vinny the Pasta Italiano.
[97:38.84]That's not what it is.
[97:50.96]Anyways, thanks for the 6,900 bits.
[97:52.40]That's a lot of money.
[97:55.50]And then PhylacteryLich gave 5,000 bits too.
[97:57.18]Another $50.
[97:57.50]I have an unhealthy desire to stream.
[98:02.14]So that works.
[98:19.67]Thanks for the $50.
[98:20.47]A thousand times.
[98:22.85]And then Lime Liquor is thanks for the five community subs.
[98:26.46]That was earlier, but thanks, guys.
[98:27.94]Thanks for the... Thanks for the $120.
[98:31.80]$150 almost.
[98:33.42]Thanks, guys.
[98:33.84]Seriously.
[98:35.24]Thank you.
[98:37.04]Who's cheating?
[98:39.73]Where are we losing the money from?
[98:40.89]Why is this place empty right now?
[98:46.85]No, it's not.
[98:50.59]You're overpaying staff.
[98:52.59]Yeah, you're right.
[98:53.43]Fuck.
[98:54.91]Oh, you make $600 a day.
[98:58.49]It's time for you to go.

[100:24.72]We gotta get people in now.
[100:25.74]Hurry before it gets to be a little too late.
[100:29.64]Level 5.
[100:32.50]You're $220.
[100:33.22]That's good.
[100:33.92]Good starting.
[100:35.01]Are you a poker player?
[100:37.17]Good.
[100:38.85]Right here.
[100:39.45]Roulette.
[100:40.99]And then we need some bar staff.
[100:51.33]That's good.
[100:51.85]We have the roulette.
[100:52.71]We need a server over here.
[100:53.91]We need some bar staff.
[100:58.77]Level 3 bar staff is fine.
[101:00.37]And a level 2 is fine.
[101:01.77]You guys can both get to work.
[101:05.79]Here come the clowns.
[101:09.45]I thought that guy was a clown for a second.
[101:10.71]Alright.
[101:10.99]You know what?
[101:12.49]You... You work here.
[101:17.27]Look, it's that easy.
[101:18.96]I need a cashier.
[101:25.22]Level one cashier.
[101:26.58]It's alright.
[101:26.96]You're just doing movie tickets.
[101:29.23]Okay, that's running now.
[101:30.69]We got one over here.
[101:31.67]Here come the clowns.
[101:36.05]God, get the fuck out of here.
[101:49.86]Okay, all the rooms are almost occupied up here.
[101:53.91]Getting some good occupancy here.
[101:55.25]There's a clown.
[101:59.09]Okay.
[101:59.73]8,200.
[101:59.75]That's a lot so far.
[102:01.55]This one's been here the whole time.
[102:04.28]That's not bad.
[102:06.56]Alright, now we need a floor manager.
[102:15.10]You're a cheat.
[102:15.78]Oh, yeah, right.
[102:17.66]Uh, Mr. Ransom.
[102:19.42]Go ahead and be our floor manager, please.
[102:22.56]And now we're not bleeding money through staff anymore.
[102:27.36]Where's the janitor?
[102:29.92]Oh, I fired the janitor.
[102:30.74]Right.
[102:31.08]Give me janitor.
[102:34.44]Level 4 janitor.
[102:35.22]That's pretty good.
[102:36.67]Actually, we don't even need a level 4 janitor.
[102:38.11]There's no trash.
[102:46.81]Okay.
[102:48.99]Nice.
[102:49.25]What are the burgers?
[102:54.21]There's a convention in town, let's overprice everything.
[102:59.73]Drinks as well.
[103:00.33]Okay.
[103:07.29]Let's go open our new, our Chuck E. Cheese.
[103:11.71]Stop saying that name!
[103:17.29]It's not... It's... It's fuckin'... Slots of cheese!
[103:30.75]Anyways, let's go.
[103:32.97]Time to buy.
[103:34.16]This is too much.
[103:38.84]30,000.
[103:38.86]30,000.
[103:40.42]The wasteland.
[103:42.56]Where was I gonna... I can't afford anywhere else.
[103:46.24]Ooh, this is not bad.
[103:46.91]I can buy the gym and turn it into a Chuck E. Cheese.
[103:54.05]I can buy the bookstore and turn it into a Chuck E. Cheese.
[103:57.33]Buy the pawn shop.
[103:58.21]Okay, I don't have enough money for this.
[103:59.23]The cupcake bakery.
[104:02.86]Oh, Frankie's Fish!
[104:05.72]I'm eventually gonna have to own that.
[104:09.26]How about... How about right here?
[104:13.18]The bookstore.
[104:18.02]That's a prime location right here.
[104:27.20]Go buy Pasta Italiano.
[104:32.30]Where even is Pasta Italiano?
[104:34.22]Right there.
[104:36.06]Can I buy Pasta Italiano?
[104:43.11]I definitely can buy Pasta Italiano.
[104:49.23]Where is it?
[104:53.25]No, I can't buy Pasta Italiano.
[104:57.49]Alright, I'm gonna buy this one here.
[104:59.21]The bookstore.
[105:05.85]Candy store or bookstore?
[105:11.27]This one.
[105:13.04]Drugstore?
[105:14.36]Nah, this isn't a much better location.
[105:20.78]The candy store is right next to the toy box.
[105:25.68]That's competition.
[105:28.60]That's also a hundred- I don't have that money!
[105:29.94]Oh, I'm doing the bookstore.
[105:32.90]I'm buying it.
[105:34.24]I'm bidding $31,000 for it right now.
[105:40.86]We good?
[105:47.75]Just open up a Spite store next to Pasta Italiano.
[105:56.09]What is this?
[105:57.89]It's an auction.
[106:01.92]I'm the highest bidder.
[106:02.56]Probably has to take a day or two.
[106:05.51]No one's gonna outbid me for the bookstore, okay?
[106:14.29]Make Pasta Italiano go bankrupt and then buy it.
[106:17.89]Well, that's never going to happen.
[106:20.19]Considering Pasta Italiano has burnt down 10 times and rebuilt 100% every time.
[106:25.77]Whoever owns Pasta Italiano has hundreds of billions of dollars in money to spend.
[106:32.05]So there's no way I can... It doesn't matter what happens.
[106:37.11]Alright, I want to make my arcade.
[106:38.57]Got it.
[106:44.28]And I got it for free because I just got $30,000 for doing that.
[106:49.24]The Wheel of Fortune has been unlocked.
[106:52.58]And I can get a large sport betting bar now.
[106:55.13]You must control a majority of Fortune Falls gambling.
[107:06.11]I need 45% market share.
[107:13.56]Holy shit.
[107:16.56]Alright, I got another.
[107:17.90]Here we go.
[107:19.81]You just bought Colston's bookstore.
[107:23.35]Oh, that's ugly.
[107:26.77]Firefighters have been called to the toy box.
[107:28.43]You're cheap.
[107:29.55]Brought home $1,500.
[107:32.36]Clams.
[107:35.16]It's one floor.
[107:39.94]Alright, I made $935.
[107:41.92]Alright, here we go.
[107:44.26]Alright, here we go.
[107:48.94]Arcade machine.
[107:49.72]Handball machine.
[107:51.81]Pool tables.
[107:53.01]Big bowling alley.
[107:54.37]Small dance floor.
[107:55.23]This is gonna be a fun place for kids.
[108:00.45]Arcade machines.
[108:03.34]We're gonna go, like, row.
[108:05.16]And then another row.
[108:09.74]Make this the Pornhouse instead?
[108:13.06]No, this is- the title of the stream is- this is Chuck E. Cheese.
[108:19.78]I'll buy another- I'll buy another property and make it a Pornhouse.
[108:30.71]Arcade machines lining the front door.
[108:44.05]When you walk into Slammin' Slots cheesy style, you are met with an incredible array of old classic video games.
[108:54.75]Take a step by.
[108:59.97]Line?
[109:00.61]What's the line?
[109:01.19]Okay.
[109:04.94]Take a step by and see the- Fuck!
[109:09.34]Jeez.
[109:17.90]God damn it.
[109:19.84]It's gotta be like... Oh, I need... I can't wait.
[109:21.76]Let me do the thing I want to do.
[109:23.54]Who did it?
[109:49.84]They just bought the Slammin' Drinks bar.
[109:51.60]Oh, fuck off.
[110:02.45]What do I have in storage?
[110:03.21]Oh, cool.
[110:08.95]COVID.
[110:09.81]No.
[110:12.07]I don't know how I want to do this.
[110:13.45]Somebody said, what is happening here?
[110:16.94]Well...
[110:19.46]I don't know.
[110:19.86]I don't know how I want to do the layout.
[110:25.30]I'm gonna store these.
[110:25.96]Okay, I want... What's the big attraction in here?
[110:29.39]It's obviously... It's obviously the bowling alley.
[110:33.65]Yeah.
[110:34.19]This is... Shut up.
[110:38.22]Please.
[110:39.44]Bowling alley.
[110:45.78]Walls first, walls first.
[110:46.94]I don't have any walls.
[110:47.92]Oh, make walls, you mean.
[110:49.37]Okay.
[110:50.37]Large wall.
[110:51.65]So you come on in the front door.
[110:53.65]And you're met with the first line.
[111:02.01]Run!
[111:03.99]Just run!
[111:04.52]Oh no, he's gonna... He's gonna get beat up.
[111:10.80]Your cheat just got back with some loot.
[111:15.36]Walls are a waste.
[111:18.25]Whatever, he's gonna get his ass kicked and he's gonna fucking turn.
[111:20.35]Whatever, who cares.
[111:21.03]Alright, let's go to, uh... Flames.
[111:25.14]Oh, here it is.
[111:44.56]Your cheat has changed sides.
[111:47.28]Your cheat has taken a beating.
[111:49.80]Hold you.
[111:54.12]Whatever, who cares.
[111:55.80]Alright, so let's do a wall coming in.
[111:59.66]You walk in the front door and you're greeted.
[112:03.63]Why am I... Oh my god, that's three strikes and you're out.
[112:08.03]This is changing.
[112:08.67]This is as soon as possible.
[112:16.86]I'm thinking like arcade machines lining both walls.
[112:20.42]Yeah.
[112:20.70]That would be sick.
[112:31.12]Just machines.
[112:32.24]Machines.
[112:56.34]God damn it.
[112:57.00]I can't do that.
[112:57.54]I need so much space.
[113:12.99]What the fuck does anything look like?
[113:14.85]You know what I mean?
[113:16.99]Anybody else have trouble doing this shit?
[113:18.49]Like... I...
[113:21.39]What does anything even look like?
[113:23.45]If I walked into a store, or walked into an arcade or something, it's like, oh, this is what it looks like.
[113:28.31]Looking at it from the top, without anything there, I don't, what the, how the fuck does any of this shit even make any sense?
[113:34.68]I don't even know how this makes, I don't even know how this works.
[113:39.26]Like, I don't even know.
[113:40.32]Oh, fuck my game.
[113:57.89]Okay, let's maybe separate it out a little more.
[113:59.97]Like this.
[114:00.31]It's gonna be like fucking toilets back here.
[114:03.91]Who cares?
[114:07.95]No, this doesn't even make any sense.
[114:09.05]What the fuck does anything even look like from above?
[114:13.33]What does everything- What does anything even look like?
[114:24.84]Like, I couldn't explain to you what a arcade... It's just, like, machines everywhere.
[114:30.29]There's no, like, walls.
[114:33.61]It's like this.
[114:35.41]There'll be, like, a wall in the middle.
[114:40.13]To separate, like, one thing.
[114:49.00]Like, there'll be machines over here, and there'll be, like, machines over here, and, like, a fucking skee-ball.
[114:54.91]The walls are usually made out of arcade machines.
[114:57.75]Yeah.
[114:57.99]Well, this would be the restaurant side.
[114:59.89]Yeah, this is like where you get your pizza and your fucking fruit snacks and shit, and this is the arcade over here.
[115:04.94]Yeah, that makes sense.
[115:07.50]I get it.
[115:09.30]Just look up a reference.
[115:10.86]You want me to look up a Chuck E. Cheese blueprint?
[115:21.67]Okay.
[115:23.17]Chuck E. Cheese floor plan.
[115:28.18]What do these even look like?
[115:30.66]Okay, here we go.
[115:31.28]Alright, how does this work?
[115:39.23]We'll see what this looks like.
[115:41.83]It's a Chuck E. Cheese.
[115:42.93]Here's a floor plan for how... Alright, let's see.
[115:58.00]Let's see what this looks like.
[116:00.90]I feel like this is impossible.
[116:04.80]What are you doing?
[116:06.12]You'll suffer, Jeremy.
[116:07.55]You just scribbled on a piece of paper.

[150:54.45]Hey, by the way, does anybody else now understand why there were no ships on the list of available hires?
[151:03.64]It's because they keep coming to Pasta Italiano and dying.
[151:27.53]I have to... But wait, there's no more available chefs.
[151:30.95]How are you going to have a pasta restaurant when every chef is putting his body out?
[151:38.09]That is fucking horrible.
[151:43.57]How do you have a... Okay.

[151:56.60]I'm going to buy it.
[152:04.98]It can't be worth more than like $20,000 or $30,000.

[153:41.60]God.
[153:44.32]Look at how many guards they desperately are trying to protect the last chef in the restaurant.
[153:52.36]It's all guards.
[153:55.88]It's because they know.
[153:58.62]If anything happens to this guy, the whole thing ends.
[154:04.93]He has a full security detail.
[154:21.76]No, no, no.
[154:22.34]I can't do a bomb.
[154:23.66]I have... Bomb has been planted.

[155:31.90]How do you get a hitman?
[155:33.08]I don't have any more.
[155:34.01]I put a bomb right here and it didn't do anything.
[155:46.11]It's a decoy.
[155:51.31]I tried to, I said plant bomb and then when he went down I said shoot chef.
[156:01.71]One of these guys just blasted him in the fucking head.
[156:08.43]How do you get hitmen?
[156:09.52]Is there any way I can buy them?
[156:11.22]Is there a hitman marketplace?
[156:12.70]Just send Garfield over here.
[156:20.93]I don't think I can send Garfield here.
[156:33.74]Can I?
[156:39.19]Oh, my fucking back hurts.
[156:42.75]When he shot, when he shot him, and I didn't even shoot him, like, that whole body hurt.

[167:58.86]Oh my God.
[168:15.77]I gotta take a break.

[168:17.15]I'll be back.
[168:19.29]I'm gonna get some water.
[168:20.15]I'll be right back.
[168:21.46]I gotta throw water in my face and shit, man.
[168:23.66]My whole body hurts.
[168:25.20]I'll be right back.
[170:30.67]Oh boy, okay.
[170:33.60]The level of running a casino turned into the shittiest mob movie on Earth.
[170:51.34]Kill the chef.
[170:52.18]And then I got a chef retaliation kill.
[170:54.89]The last thing that guy did before he died is he killed the chef.
[170:58.55]That was who he was going for.
[170:59.77]This is back and forth killing each other's chefs.
[171:04.51]Oh, man.
[171:15.00]Ugh.
[171:17.22]Okay.
[171:17.44]Okay.
[171:19.30]So, uh, I'm gonna just chill for a little bit.
[171:21.70]We're gonna go back in.
[171:23.20]And I'm gonna try to salvage this for a little bit.
[171:26.43]And then, probably in the next 10 to 20 minutes, I'm gonna save it.
[171:29.43]I'm gonna quit.
[171:32.55]And, uh, we're gonna pick the movie we're gonna watch next week.
[171:38.78]I laughed so hard during at least this last part that- Oh.
[171:44.34]I'm hurtin'.
[171:45.98]Jesus.
[171:48.17]It was this... Oh my god.
[171:55.00]What movie?
[171:55.62]What movie?
[171:56.16]We're going to watch a public domain movie on Tuesday of this coming week.
[172:05.09]But let's get back in and try to recuperate.
[172:09.36]I don't know how I do that because a bunch of people are just dead now.
[172:13.32]My staff, I have, my place was burnt.
[172:17.72]I only have 15 grand.
[172:21.00]I gotta check on the hotels.
[172:21.98]Is there going to be a restriction on who can watch the movie?
[172:27.86]No.
[172:28.70]It's just going to be a public domain movie.
[172:32.53]And we also have to make sure that it not only is a public domain, but it fits into a TOS as well.
[172:38.77]Because a lot of old public domain movies might be pushing it, I think.
[172:45.29]Alright.
[172:49.35]What is going on now?
[172:50.29]Let's go back and take a look at my...
[173:02.30]Yeah, this is all fucked up.
[173:03.60]I mean, look, this thing is making tons.
[173:05.24]This place is making money.
[173:06.18]Alright, is there... Wow, we got a surplus.
[173:15.45]How did we get this many?

[174:01.67]Poor security.
[174:07.52]Do I even have a bouncer here?
[174:09.06]Wait, I thought I bought one.
[174:16.44]Oh, a bunch of people quit during that bullshit at the pasta place.

[175:19.77]Oh, that's how the food is.
[175:35.24]This place is making money.
[175:46.10]Isn't that a teenager?
[175:48.67]I need janitor.

[175:51.83]Ugh.

[175:57.29]I don't want to... Cheating is... So we're already... I'm not losing money.
[176:06.88]I'm good.
[176:10.37]Yeah, I already did cheat, but not...
[176:16.54]Use my cheats to rob casinos.
[176:19.82]Yeah, well, I mean, we just had a couple of major things just go down.
[176:23.62]I only have one.
[176:27.47]What are you doing down here, by the way?
[176:29.11]Go upstairs.
[176:33.29]Bars and bistros.
[176:34.45]Oh, well, I'm okay.
[176:35.95]Look, I made $2,000 in like five minutes.
[176:39.03]Why are you down here?
[176:40.77]Seriously, what are you doing?
[176:45.15]Well, can some of you go to the other casino?
[176:56.27]Use a UFO attack.
[176:57.75]Please read.
[177:00.07]A fetishist's convention will start in a day.
[177:06.96]Okay.
[177:07.30]They're not coming to the cheesy slots, right?
[177:16.77]I'm actually making a lot of money.
[177:21.26]Let's check out up here.
[177:23.26]How are things?
[177:24.06]How's staff?
[177:24.72]Do I have enough staff?
[177:26.66]I do.
[177:27.64]20 bucks a pop.
[177:29.24]The roulette's making money.
[177:31.46]This is making money.
[177:33.23]There's lots of doing well.
[177:36.57]This casino is running very, very, like, a clean engine.
[177:43.09]UFO Pasta Italiano.
[177:45.47]Alright, you do realize that when I do the UFO attack, that's when I have to stop playing the game.
[177:50.88]That's where it's over.
[177:53.62]Let me see the fetish convention first.
[177:59.26]I think that's important.
[178:03.07]Make sure this is on dull.
[178:05.95]Make it 25 bucks.
[178:11.46]Well, let's go over everything.
[178:12.72]Let's see, what's made the most money?
[178:16.16]The most money I've made has been from poker.
[178:20.02]Poker has made 30 grand.
[178:22.12]And then this little small sports betting has made 12.
[178:27.07]And roulette.
[178:28.89]And then a few of the... One of the medium slots.
[178:31.17]And then all the high slots have made a shitload of money.
[178:34.43]What has made the least amount of money?
[178:40.10]That makes sense, though.
[178:47.24]Large sports betting.
[178:48.72]Somebody's at empty.
[178:53.42]What about food?
[178:56.18]Uh, the drinks bar.
[178:57.21]The bar, obviously.
[178:57.99]$3,200.
[178:59.65]Burgers, and then... The candy kiosk has made nothing.
[179:07.45]Uh, obviously the porn theater has made the most amount of money.
[179:10.68]But small stage one is encroaching.
[179:17.20]Sheddish waiting room.
[179:18.20]Just hold on.
[179:19.64]It's coming up now.
[179:22.83]Uh, by the way, because that convention's coming up.
[179:27.65]Make those prices a little more steep, don't you say?
[179:34.87]Uh, there's no janitor here, is there?
[179:38.01]I need a janitor.
[179:38.95]Clean!
[179:46.20]Uh...
[179:49.50]When's the convention?
[179:50.22]I think tomorrow.
[179:54.03]Dude, this makes a lot.
[179:55.05]Look at this.
[179:55.47]This is a full theater.
[179:59.94]Let's watch.
[180:20.25]This sucks.
[180:31.61]Oh, here comes the performer.
[180:32.65]What does he do?
[180:34.93]No, stay, stay.
[180:35.77]Alright, awaiting orders.
[180:40.42]Cheat.
[180:47.50]Cheat at the casino.
[180:48.38]Look at how much...
[180:51.15]This is insane, look at all the guards.
[180:54.05]God, so, security's beefed up so much.
[181:01.01]Ow, oh my GOD!
[181:03.34]Hold on.
[181:03.72]Just get it the fuck away from me.
[181:14.86]Get it away from me!
[181:15.94]Get this thing away from me!
[181:17.12]Like, why do I- it keeps happening.
[181:18.90]In such a bad spot.
[181:22.54]Alright, here comes the convention.
[181:24.38]Let's see.
[181:30.95]This might be the most people I've ever had in the casino.
[181:33.33]It's doing so well.
[181:34.27]$10,000 in only a few days.
[181:39.63]$12,000 in profit.
[181:54.97]It's the end of the day.
[181:55.91]Wages have been paid.
[181:57.61]Oh, you got 1500?
[181:58.33]Good.
[181:58.47]I have spotted a chute.
[182:02.99]Have you?
[182:04.67]Have you?
[182:06.05]Where?
[182:08.23]Charity?
[182:08.59]Alright, when is the fetish convention?
[182:13.93]Are they coming in?
[182:24.53]Here we go.
[182:26.77]Axe denies doing anything wrong and is outright by your actions.
[182:29.54]Whatever.
[182:35.06]Convention's coming in.
[182:35.80]You know what that means.
[182:42.00]Fetish convention.
[182:44.50]Uh-huh.
[182:50.31]What do they have written on?
[182:53.55]What was that?
[183:02.64]Are they just walking around with no shirts on?
[183:04.12]Check the other property.
[183:23.40]No, it's just people having some fun.
[183:25.52]Yeah, see?
[183:27.88]There's nobody from, like, the fetish convention here.
[183:33.53]Nobody wants to eat this food.
[183:36.57]Maybe it's because it's $15 for a shitty pizza.
[183:39.81]How much are the sodas?
[183:44.94]It's a little cheaper.
[183:51.44]Empty tables.
[183:52.44]I know.
[183:52.76]It's bad.
[183:53.18]It's okay.
[183:54.30]This is propping us up.
[184:00.61]Oh, God.
[184:16.34]A lot of people drunk here.
[184:30.91]This guy keeps the- Alright, get rid of this dude.
[184:35.39]He keeps the- Okay, do you just have a problem with this guy?
[184:39.41]Every time I check if this guy's cheating, he's not.
[184:42.45]You've just been staring at him.
[184:44.33]All day.
[184:45.91]He keeps thinking he's cheating, and he never is!
[184:47.57]I gotta fire you!
[184:49.91]You're doing a terrible job, man!
[184:51.69]This guy's like the five-star dealer at this establishment.
[184:54.39]You don't even know what you're talking about.
[184:55.48]Ugh, I want an ice cream.
[185:16.27]Alright, I think it's... Wait.
[185:18.01]I wanna see what this is.
[185:20.75]Um... Is this guy... Uh... A diaper?
[185:26.02]Is this guy a baby?
[185:46.57]Okay, let's be generous.
[185:50.83]Maybe you'll stay now.
[185:54.19]Hey, everybody!
[185:55.71]Hey, everybody!
[185:56.61]Merry Christmas!
[185:57.37]Just made it back.

[186:18.88]And I just got $2,000 for it.
[186:21.96]Thank you.
[186:22.42]I told you guys.
[186:23.82]Now we just go through and reduce everybody's pay by $200.
[186:50.59]beating each other up over there.
[186:53.61]There we go, see?
[186:58.68]I need a new friend!
[187:02.40]I need a new friend!
[187:04.88]Oop.
[187:05.88]Alright, fine.
[187:06.80]You can have a little bit more money.
[187:09.83]Any other, like, fetish people?
[187:11.73]Besides the people in the suit and the guy in the baby costume?
[187:18.47]I think that's it.
[187:19.83]Just babies and people in latex.
[187:24.43]Everyone's vomiting?
[187:25.23]Yeah, because this is, like, fetish party.
[187:27.53]And the drinks are actually very expensive.
[187:29.95]This is actually good for me.
[187:37.23]Check slothy cheese.
[187:45.12]Eh, place it.
[187:47.29]All the old people love the magicians, I'll tell you.
[187:49.31]And they love soda, too.
[187:52.29]They love magicians.
[187:53.85]Old people love the soda.
[187:56.78]Oh, old people playing pinball.
[187:58.36]No one's bought a single thing.
[188:06.86]Oh, gross.
[188:07.64]Don't say that.
[188:16.20]Okay, let's save it here.
[188:22.91]A new day.
[188:24.17]How about that?
[188:27.10]Okay, you ready?
[188:28.54]How do I do the UFO?
[188:38.30]Use UFO on attack, please.
[188:39.80]Okay, well, so... Run it on, pause the tally and press escape.
[188:45.82]Uh, type in load the dice now and then type in UFO.
[188:48.78]Do I have to be outside?
[188:51.18]Okay, so... Load the dice.
[189:04.76]Oh.
[189:04.86]UFO.
[189:06.54]A flying saucer is attacking the city.
[189:11.30]Dude, that just seriously went...
[189:34.85]There's a cheat over here.
[189:39.65]How do I send it to the pasta place?
[189:49.01]It's the end of the day.
[189:50.49]Wages have been paid.
[189:52.07]Send it?
[189:52.63]I... Can I?
[189:53.77]Are you looking for company?
[190:07.56]Help!
[190:08.32]The city is being attacked!
[190:31.46]Holy shit, they're all spotted at the same time!
[190:51.48]Where's Fasta Italiano?
[190:57.37]It's 5G sound.
[191:00.97]Fasta Italiano!
[191:02.91]You're capping the point.
[191:26.21]What if there's... What if there's nobody left?
[191:40.80]Time has been added.
[191:48.54]I... Godzilla?
[191:49.54]Hold on, wait.
[191:51.76]Let me see... There's other cheats I can do that are like this?
[191:56.61]Let's see.
[192:03.28]Godzilla?
[192:07.22]Big heads?
[192:10.24]Puke?
[192:11.08]Puke more!
[192:18.99]Oh, game crashed.
[192:22.91]Game crashed.
[192:24.01]Game crashed!
[192:26.53]That's a bad crash, too.
[192:27.73]I have to do this.
[192:28.64]Hold on.
[192:35.18]I want to come back.
[192:35.74]I want to do Puke more.
[192:38.39]We'll load up the save.
[192:41.89]I'm going to go in Past Italiano and do Puke more, do Godzilla, and then burn the playstone.
[192:59.07]And then we'll be over.
[193:02.09]We'll transition to picking a movie for Tuesday.
[193:04.99]You're a monster.
[193:12.02]Can't let pasta italiana survive.
[193:25.39]It was a new day.
[193:34.00]Okay, pasta italiana, let's go check it out.
[193:35.78]What if it wasn't on the list anymore?
[193:46.89]It's not.
[193:55.29]It's gone.
[194:02.98]It closed.
[194:12.95]No, they didn't.
[194:16.71]Yes, they did.
[194:26.36]Yes, they did.
[194:27.10]Alright, what is it?
[194:30.48]There's a chef already coming out.
[194:32.05]Again, he's angry.
[194:32.99]There's no more... What?
[194:34.93]Close the dice.
[194:38.07]Puke.
[194:44.82]Puke more.
[194:45.40]It's not working.
[194:50.71]Puke more.
[195:05.42]It's the end of the day.
[195:06.46]Wages have been paid.
[195:08.02]Detective casinos?
[195:09.60]I mean, there's nothing here.
[195:16.45]It's the kind of visit.
[195:18.02]Here's the thing, I can't tell if this is more puke or just a normal amount of puke that I've seen the whole game.
[195:40.60]No, it's definitely more.
[196:03.13]Wait, that was just coming out of his ass.
[196:13.19]Oh god, that was insane.
[196:19.12]Family Guy.
[196:19.96]Peter, Peter.
[196:21.54]Peter, I think... I'll...
[196:34.80]What's the next one?
[196:35.94]Uh, dance for me.
[196:38.72]Dance for me.
[196:39.50]That one didn't work.
[196:50.17]Oh, fuck.
[196:50.95]Oh my god, it really did.
[196:52.05]Oh my god.
[196:53.49]Oh my god, it really does do that.
[196:55.61]What?
[196:57.03]Oh my god.
[197:13.52]This is so fucked up Watch out for the giant lizard!
[197:45.21]Oh shit, he's coming for me!
[197:46.75]Go, go get this old guy!
[197:50.43]Wow, you're stupid.
[197:54.65]That was a GTA driver.
[198:00.10]Sidewalk driving.
[198:16.12]Your hitman has arrived at Pasta Italiano!
[198:18.64]Why do I care?
[198:20.04]Does he do anything?
[198:22.00]Hey!
[198:30.08]One of your opponents has just gone bust!
[198:31.78]I don't know where he is.
[198:41.53]Help!
[198:42.39]The city is being attacked!
[198:55.06]Bad hygiene?
[198:56.58]Wait, you can get arrested for bad hygiene?
[199:07.10]He's too slow.
[199:08.34]This is just a guy in a costume.
[199:10.78]There we go.
[199:12.61]He's not getting away.
[199:23.96]Okay.
[199:25.32]The final thing I'm gonna do.
[199:49.21]This is giving me five every time, by the way.
[200:13.67]Eat some lead.
[200:17.87]Eat some lead.
[200:21.35]Unlucky, punk.
[200:22.52]Say your prayers.
[200:24.02]You're all washed up.
[200:25.98]You're all washed up.
[200:27.16]Whoa, who is that?
[200:28.60]You're all washed up.
[200:29.90]This ain't personal.
[200:32.32]Eat some lead.
[200:32.94]Eat some lead.
[200:33.58]Eat some lead.
[200:34.10]Say your prayers.
[200:35.02]Unlucky, punk.
[200:51.25]I don't know what this is gonna do.
[200:56.35]My computer's gonna crash.
[200:57.43]My computer's gonna crash.
[200:58.81]My computer's gonna fucking crash.
[201:10.78]You are all washed up.
[201:17.47]Well, that was Casino Inc.
[201:21.05]Yeah, I gotta reel it in.
[201:22.81]I have... I gotta reel it in.
[201:26.59]Let's take a little bit, let's find out what we're gonna watch.
[201:29.56]That game, this is fucking awesome.
[201:33.34]This is such a fun game.
[201:34.90]I'm so glad that it turned out as good as it did.
[201:38.72]Alright, we're not done.
[201:39.74]We're gonna start looking at some movies to watch.
[201:43.85]Public domain movies, we're gonna take a look and see which one.
[201:47.51]I have seen a few of these that people are already linking.
[201:52.75]I'm gonna find a good one.
[201:53.72]I have seen Captain Alex.
[201:58.20]I have seen the Bean one, too.
[202:09.53]So we have to pick something else.
[202:13.60]I want, here, I'll give you the, here's the criteria, let's go over it.
[202:16.39]Let's get out of here first.
[202:18.55]That was Casino Inc., if you were watching Casino Inc.
[202:21.81]Um, played it yesterday as well, and it was, I haven't laughed that hard in at least, at least six months.
[202:28.77]Without a doubt.
[202:31.29]So, let's go.
[202:32.37]Uh, Abe Cashim, thanks for the 20 community subs.
[202:39.10]That's a huge amount of subs, thanks for the 20 fucking subs, dude.
[202:46.37]That's a lot.
[202:48.03]Trolls2?
[202:49.21]Troll2?
[202:49.65]Troll2 is not public domain, is it?
[202:53.31]I don't think Troll2 is public domain.
[203:03.76]I do not think so.
[203:06.97]Let's, anyways.
[203:08.05]Hi, how you doing?
[203:10.57]Alright, so...
[203:15.04]Did you see my new Star Wars shirt?
[203:16.24]It's a periodic table of villains.
[203:23.96]Shave.
[203:24.30]I'll see you in a shave today.
[203:25.43]Let me shave tonight.
[203:28.01]You're a nerd.
[203:28.67]Whatever.
[203:29.33]Oh, okay.
[203:30.01]We're on twitch.tv.
[203:31.23]Sorry.
[203:35.23]Don't shave my face.
[203:37.61]Why not?
[203:39.44]Alright, so let's take a look.
[203:41.10]What are some good options?
[203:43.18]Remember, they have to be in the public domain and they have to be TOS friendly.
[203:49.05]There's some non-TOS friendly public domain movies.
[203:52.25]What do you got?
[204:01.09]There's a lot of free shit on YouTube.
[204:02.67]Let's take a look.
[204:10.13]Well, free does not mean public domain.
[204:13.23]Just because a movie is free doesn't mean that I can stream it.
[204:18.77]We need a list of good public... Here we go.
[204:20.77]List of movies in the public domain.

[206:26.50]Little Shop of Horrors is a fucking great, great movie, and it's also a great play, too, right?

[207:44.66]It should be.
[207:52.31]It's the same thing?
[207:53.30]Alright, so I got Attack of the Giant Leeches, Carnival of Souls, three Stooges episodes.
[208:03.73]Manos Hands of Fate.
[208:05.91]Yeah, but that's like, I feel like everybody's seen that one.
[208:09.62]I don't think anybody here has not seen that one.
[208:14.16]Plan 9 from Outer Space.
[208:16.68]Let's take a look.
[208:21.75]That's not even, yeah, I don't think that's TOS friendly.
[208:24.99]I'm not sure I could do that.
[208:28.19]Okay, hold on a minute.
[208:32.40]There's a movie called The Gorilla.
[208:36.80]And it looks like there's just like a gorilla that like attacks people.
[208:46.63]1930, it's going to be a guy in a gorilla costume, like throwing punches at actors, right?
[208:51.09]I'm going to put it in tab.
[208:53.65]Let's take a look at it.
[209:05.19]Is that the one?
[209:06.09]Is it the gorilla?
[209:09.01]I feel like the gorilla might be the one.
[209:11.19]I feel like the gorilla.
[209:12.41]It could be the gorilla.
[209:24.54]It's King's Bride.
[209:27.76]There's a movie called Slugs.
[209:31.43]Alright, get slugs on the list.
[209:34.33]Let's get slugs on there.
[209:39.55]Hold on.
[209:41.71]Yeah, I don't think I can do Manos Hand of Fate, unfortunately.
[209:44.19]I don't think that's possible.
[209:47.60]Chicken Run?
[209:50.98]Was there an original Chicken Run that was public domain before the Claymation one?
[209:57.22]That's not accurate, is it?

[210:49.04]What about the Screaming Skull?
[210:50.60]I'm just going to put the Screaming Skull on here.
[211:00.74]A Star is Born.
[211:02.90]Oh no, that was like a remake, right?
[211:04.74]Okay, the original one is.
[211:07.10]Same movie?
[211:10.26]Wait, the Superman cartoon?
[211:13.28]The 1940s Superman cartoon is public domain.
[211:17.86]Are you shitting me?
[211:19.34]Gonna have to watch a couple of those.
[211:20.40]Alright, what are you guys seeing in Wallace and Gromit?
[211:34.43]I don't see Wallace and Gromit under here.
[211:40.76]They are not seeing it.
[211:41.62]They just want you to watch Wallace and Gromit.
[211:49.53]Wallace and Gromit is paramount or something.
[211:55.25]Where's Metropolis?
[211:56.05]Is that public?
[211:56.55]I don't see it on here.
[212:05.96]Killer Bean.
[212:07.72]Yeah, I've seen almost every clip from Killer Bean.
[212:12.04]I mean, I'll put it on the list just because.
[212:16.60]But I feel like most people have seen that.
[212:25.71]Captain Alex.
[212:26.95]I've seen Captain Alex already.
[212:32.39]Take that off the list.
[212:33.45]Well, this is just a preliminary list.
[212:35.07]I'm going to do some research after the stream.
[212:38.31]And I'm going to pick a few of these.
[212:40.33]And that's what we're going to do.
[212:42.37]Might even be able to hold on to some of these.
[212:46.51]And Charlie Chaplin.
[212:49.01]Charlie Chaplin movies.
[212:50.15]Oh, wait.
[212:50.79]Charlie Chaplin movies are like four minutes long each, aren't they?
[212:55.17]The technology back in like 1908 was like $400 million to do like three minutes of video.
[213:02.12]Okay, yeah, we'll do Charlie Chaplin.
[213:03.29]We'll get those on the list.
[213:11.05]Buster Keaton.
[213:11.67]What's Buster Keaton?
[213:16.42]Buster Keaton, Sherlock Jr.
[213:18.30]Okay.
[213:24.90]Alright, I think we've got a pretty good preliminary list here.
[213:30.87]The Gorilla, Night of the Living Dead, Plan 9 from Outer Space, The Screaming Skull, Superman original 1940s cartoon, Attack of the Giant Leeches, The Carnival of Souls, The Three Stooges, Buster Keaton, and Charlie Chaplin.
[213:52.62]A Bucket of Blood.
[213:53.62]Alright, I'll look into that one.
[214:03.13]watch narrow toe yeah put that on the list narrow toes in public domain no it's it's in there the leech one will be good yeah killer clowns is that I don't think that's public domain I'm voting for gorilla gorilla might be the I think it's gonna be gorilla
[214:30.88]So here's the, I have a question.
[214:32.90]So this is a, oh, let's just watch public domain movies until we can't fucking take it anymore.
[214:37.38]Right?
[214:38.82]Should there be a scenario?
[214:40.46]What's, what's the cutoff?
[214:43.12]What's the cutoff if after 20 minutes or 30 minutes, it's like, this is sucks.
[214:49.27]It's not even funny.
[214:50.55]It's not even interesting.
[214:51.37]It's not scary.
[214:51.95]It's terrible.
[214:53.27]Is there, is there a cutoff we can do after like 20 minutes to be like, we gotta, we gotta go with something.
[214:57.97]We gotta do something.
[214:58.53]We gotta move on to the next one.
[215:01.38]40 minutes.
[215:04.80]And we're going to do at least one or two.
[215:06.48]I told you the way that I watch some movies sometimes is... Yeah, we're going to do at least three or four of these at the Jerma985 technique.
[215:13.35]I've told you about it before.
[215:14.83]The Jerma985 watch movie technique that you don't give a fuck about is you skip 10 minutes and watch 60 seconds, skip 20 minutes, watch 5 minutes, skip 30 minutes, watch 2 minutes, skip 10 minutes, watch 10 minutes.
[215:28.18]That's the technique.
[215:29.16]And you can get the whole fucking movie that way.
[215:33.39]We're going to do that with at least one or two of these.
[215:37.93]To get the whole movie.
[215:38.65]I'm going to have a bingo chart for the movie.
[215:47.45]That might be fun too, just to have a bingo chart for each individual movie of what could happen.
[215:57.18]It's effective and it's efficient, it is.
[215:59.58]Did you guys not hear the first part of what I said?
[216:02.52]I didn't say, yeah, I really, I watched Infinity War like that.
[216:06.89]No, no, no.
[216:07.43]I said, a movie that you don't, don't do the quotes, people hate that.
[216:13.25]A movie that you don't give a shit about, that you don't even want to watch, like Dad's Home 2, that's what you do it to.
[216:24.90]And you end up watching about 25 minutes of the movie, and you don't, who cares?
[216:31.28]You saw Will Ferrell, like, shit his pants and change the thermostat and somebody got hot and they were, like, sweaty and they were mad.
[216:38.06]You got to see that part.
[216:43.64]Why do that at all?
[216:44.40]To save yourself, like, 65 minutes.
[216:52.21]It's daddy's home.
[216:55.13]Okay, so what's worse?
[216:56.97]25 minutes of daddy's home, too?
[216:59.06]Or watch all of Daddy's Home 2 and not get that time back.
[217:02.76]And have 67 minutes to do whatever the hell you want.
[217:07.43]You could fucking go, you could read a book.
[217:09.45]You could, like, do dishes.
[217:10.83]You could go for a walk.
[217:12.09]Think of all the things you could do.
[217:13.65]You could play, like, a full, rage-induced, please surrender at 20 minutes, what the fuck, I'm not stuck here for 45 minutes League of Legends match.
[217:23.64]You could do that.
[217:30.55]Please.
[217:33.47]Don't watch it at all, idiot.
[217:34.83]Alright, I've got a good list.
[217:39.02]If you have any other ones, throw them in the chat.
[217:41.36]Or throw them in the recommended.
[217:42.36]I'll take a look at them too.
[217:45.50]No one said idiot.
[217:46.10]Yes, they did.
[217:47.30]They said idiot.
[217:48.36]They called me an idiot.
[217:52.07]But make sure that they're actually in public domain.
[217:54.13]Otherwise, I can't stream them.
[217:57.41]Alright.
[217:59.39]We're going to wrap it up here.
[218:00.19]This is where the stream is going to end.
[218:03.69]I'm going to go take a bath.
[218:05.92]A long one.
[218:08.02]Because right here, right here is fucking killing me.
[218:13.18]In here.
[218:13.58]Am I going to stream tomorrow?
[218:18.55]The next stream will be on Tuesday.
[218:20.03]We're going to go Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and possibly Saturday.
[218:26.27]I'll give you what's going to happen.
[218:27.29]Tuesday is going to be movies.
[218:30.01]Wednesday, community content night.
[218:32.05]Thursday, mystery game.
[218:33.77]Friday, easy bake oven stream.
[218:37.45]Big one.
[218:39.31]And maybe we might have to move it to Saturday, depending on if I can get everything set up.
[218:46.12]Oh, what about that guy's birthday?
[218:47.14]Yeah, I'm coming in here on Monday, and I'm going to sing happy birthday in the chat.
[218:55.09]Attention, attention, can we do this every month?
[218:57.77]Well, that all depends on if this is fun.
[219:00.67]I mean, if we do this on Monday, I mean, on Tuesday, if we start the stream on Tuesday and we get the movie going and it's like, wow, here we go, and it's like, that was dumb.
[219:10.25]That, like, wasn't even any fun, and nobody, that was bad, and nobody liked it, and neither did I. Then we probably won't.
[219:17.19]But if it's fun, and we can actually have a good time, and then, yeah.
[219:23.41]I'm down.
[219:24.45]I'm down to do it whenever.
[219:25.33]I mean, there's plenty of movies that you can watch that are public domain.
[219:31.19]The worst dream incoming.
[219:34.92]Well, if you have that bottom, you got that bottom mentality, we can only go up from there.
[219:41.72]What about DOS nights?
[219:42.78]I don't know.
[219:51.63]What happened to those?
[219:57.35]DOS Saturday.
[220:00.11]No, well, no, I'm not going to say that.
[220:01.97]Because I don't like to tell people things that don't happen.
[220:09.13]Autumn energy chat?
[220:15.14]Alright, I'll see you guys Tuesday.
[220:17.92]Thanks for sticking around.
[220:19.96]Again, we're going to do this thing where I stream at least four times a week.
[220:24.42]but between four to five hours each time.
[220:26.78]And they'll probably end up happening in a row.
[220:29.82]So it'll be like four to six hours, like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and maybe Friday or something, like in a row, rather than three times for like six to seven hours.
[220:44.42]I'm a lot about playing Doom.
[220:50.63]I still can.
[220:52.57]It's just that we had a lot of these things that seemed like fun to do.
[220:57.35]When are you going to do Sam & Max Season 3?
[220:58.69]I abandoned it.
[221:00.35]And I'm totally okay saying that.
[221:02.21]I abandoned Sam & Max Season 3.
[221:04.01]I wasn't feeling it.
[221:04.69]Didn't think it was... Didn't grab me like the other two did.
[221:07.93]It has been officially... It's been abandoned.
[221:09.90]Officially.
[221:10.34]Sorry.
[221:14.16]Why?
[221:14.86]Why?
[221:15.48]Why?
[221:16.08]Finish Beautiful Joe.
[221:22.35]I know, I know, I know, I know, trust me.
[221:27.25]You know when I turned that stream off a couple days ago?
[221:31.55]I sat there for like an extra five minutes and I'm just like, fuck, I didn't like that.
[221:36.69]Why didn't I like that game?
[221:40.45]I can't believe it.
[221:41.40]It's alright.
[221:50.14]But we'll see you on Tuesday.
[221:53.18]Thanks for sticking around.
[221:54.62]Hope you have a good rest of your weekend.
[221:58.76]What about No More Heroes 2?
[221:59.60]We're still gonna play it.
[222:01.20]All these games you're saying, we're still gonna play.
[222:05.48]We're gonna do a non-gaming week, except for Thursday.
[222:09.30]Thursday will be a mystery stream.
[222:11.94]And by mystery stream, it might be software Xbox 360.
[222:15.42]Just saying, it could be that.
[222:18.69]It might be something else.
[222:19.75]It could be that, though.
[222:30.33]I don't know.
[222:30.99]We'll see.
[222:32.63]Right at the very- right here, right now, Savov- Savovsky gave $50.
[222:38.10]5,000 bits.
[222:40.24]And that's- that's been- $50 has been dropped like five times.
[222:49.68]Thank you, Savovsky.
[222:51.40]He said, enjoy your bath, you filthy animal.
[222:53.04]Thank you for providing great content day after day.
[222:55.73]Though stuck at home.
[222:56.73]Really, I'm making a big difference.
[223:00.19]I'm glad you think so.
[223:01.29]I'm absolutely happy to do this and hang out.
[223:05.13]As long as I'm able to.
[223:10.20]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[223:12.00]Stay safe.
[223:13.66]Take care of yourself, take care of your loved ones, take care of your friends.
[223:19.40]Thanks a lot.
[223:21.03]Uh, Phylactery Lich gave another $50 earlier.
[223:23.93]They said, please, God, do that to the Crypt Casino.
[223:27.41]I think they were talking about, um, just melting an entire building.
[223:32.63]But, uh, I don't go that.
[223:33.87]I don't cheat that way.
[223:40.11]Jerma, what about the joke?
[223:41.23]Jerma, the joke!
[223:42.53]I know, I know.
[223:43.25]Don't worry.
[223:45.76]I know, don't worry.
[223:47.02]It only can happen on the movie stream.
[223:52.57]It can't happen anywhere else.
[223:54.57]I didn't forget it.
[223:55.43]I didn't forget it, trust me.
[223:59.45]Thank you, both of you.
[224:00.05]Thanks, Bylaxery, for another $50.
[224:01.99]And Zabockski, for $50.
[224:03.11]Both of you.
[224:06.17]Let's go back.
[224:08.00]Earlier, let's go back to... Esquilo, thanks for $2.50.
[224:12.88]Grimba985, I want to record you a public domain movie on YouTube called Who Killed Captain Alex?
[224:19.27]Already seen it?
[224:20.67]It's a very funny movie and the production only cost $200.
[224:22.65]People made it with passion.
[224:25.23]It's the first action movie of Uganda.
[224:28.21]You can donate to them if you want.
[224:29.87]They give you a hand-painted t-shirt.
[224:31.81]They love when people share the movie because that would mean the world to them.
[224:35.59]The movie starts with some info I can't put here.
[224:38.52]Support it.
[224:40.02]Yeah.
[224:41.23]I know.
[224:42.69]I've seen Captain Alex.
[224:47.43]So... I mean, I would shout it out and just be like, just fucking watch this and support this movie, right?
[224:53.71]Because it's awesome.
[225:03.00]But at least for the first few, I'd like to see something that I haven't seen yet.
[225:06.74]Because then I can give you
[225:10.76]At least for me, too.
[225:11.62]Like, I want to be able to see something I've never seen, and you'll get a real reaction.
[225:15.78]It'll be a real reaction stream.
[225:19.79]Watch Breaking Bad.
[225:20.75]Nice.
[225:24.45]Yeah.
[225:25.13]I have seen it.
[225:25.53]Uh, hey, Jason, thanks for the $2.50, Jason.
[225:29.57]I requested to watch Otto's Big Adventure for Movie Night when you mentioned the idea, but you said instantly.
[225:34.81]I still stand with the suggestion for Wednesday.
[225:37.63]And chat would also like this too.
[225:39.53]We must watch both videos.
[225:41.69]Yeah, but I already did that.
[225:43.39]But this is not YouTube Movie Night.
[225:46.07]This is like public domain, real movies movies.
[225:52.10]We will do another Watch Old Videos stream again.
[225:55.62]It's not on Wednesday.
[225:58.50]Or not on Tuesday.
[226:03.00]Otto is a real movie.
[226:04.29]Well, Otto's Big Adventure was not a movie made by a production company.
[226:10.87]And it didn't release in theaters.
[226:12.91]Although, god damn it, it should have.
[226:17.00]We will watch them again, I promise.
[226:18.38]Just not on one of these streams.
[226:23.59]Teepo.
[226:24.13]Thank you, Teepo, for the thousand bits.
[226:25.33]Appreciate it.
[226:25.75]Remember, I just had my first major nasty breakup today.
[226:29.73]I want to thank you in this community for just being there.
[226:32.59]I don't talk much in chat or in the Discord because I'm very shy, but it's always very comforting to come back and watch you live.
[226:39.23]What everybody has to say in chat, and it always makes me feel like I'm not truly just alone and depressed in my room all the time.
[226:45.24]Hope you're handling your condition well, and sorry for the long and feelsy message.
[226:49.34]I love you guys.
[226:52.00]Oh, it's all good, man.
[226:55.07]It's hard to hear about the breakup.
[226:59.37]First major nasty breakup.
[227:01.03]It's always tough.
[227:04.08]But you'll be back.
[227:08.30]I've been there a couple times.
[227:11.96]Over the 30 years that I've been on the planet.
[227:15.56]35, I know.
[227:15.98]Don't correct me.
[227:19.24]So, I feel you.
[227:23.64]But thanks for sticking around.
[227:24.60]Thanks for hanging out.
[227:25.77]We are absolutely happy to welcome anybody that wants to hang out here.
[227:30.61]That's kind of all I care about on this channel is having just people hang out, laughing, talking shit about random stuff, walking around.
[227:37.97]Just having a good time.
[227:39.41]That's it.
[227:39.90]That's pretty much the number one thing.
[227:42.88]But to know that somebody's doing that, it means a lot.
[227:53.29]Irma's 35 despite looking 19.
[227:55.47]I look older than 19.
[227:58.71]I get carded at bars, guys.
[228:02.33]Wait, that means... Oh.
[228:07.09]That is what that means.
[228:12.03]I don't know where my brain was going with that.
[228:15.76]I think it was trying to say I don't get carded, but I do every time, no matter what.
[228:21.87]Like, I get carded because I look younger than I do.
[228:25.81]Yeah, okay.
[228:26.79]So I'm wrong.
[228:27.37]It's alright.
[228:29.69]Hey, mostly lost thanks to the 250.
[228:30.95]I think it's adorable how you always pronounce the full words when you see laughing my ass off.
[228:36.91]LMAO doesn't sound correct to me.
[228:40.55]LMAO.
[228:42.01]No, that's... I don't like that.
[228:44.79]LMAO.
[228:45.61]I feel like I'm texting.
[228:47.21]Like, LMAO.
[228:50.33]BRB, G2G, LMAO.
[228:52.13]No, it's laughing my fucking ass off.
[228:58.25]LMFAO.
[228:58.67]LMFAO.
[229:00.47]LMFAO.
[229:06.47]Alright.
[229:07.77]Hey, hot gamer, thanks for the $5.
[229:09.55]This whole chat trashing Beautiful Joe kind of reminds me of when Hideki Kimiya tried doing focus testing, which is mostly composed of children, LMAO, for Beautiful Joe, and this happened.
[229:22.38]They said, I think the whole focus group thing is not the way to make a game because you start to bring in other people's opinions and lose some of the originality.
[229:28.70]For Beautiful Joe, we brought in some kids to do a focus test and asked them, what do you think of the characters?
[229:34.58]And all the kids said, oh, his head's too big.
[229:37.82]Or Sylvie is annoying.
[229:39.96]I just want to kill her.
[229:41.91]They were just trashing the game.
[229:43.41]So I just got pissed off and said, I'm not changing anything.
[229:53.06]I'm glad he did because the game is fantastic.
[229:55.58]It's the best game Maybe you should try his method and play whatever game you like regardless of what chat says I do that I do that though So times when I Because you gotta remember I do like to play the things that I want to play and I do it most of the time I
[230:19.98]But it gets to be a point where it's very evident that people just not don't want... My goal here, when I broadcast, is I want everyone to have fun and have a good time.
[230:32.03]And I want to be having a good time.
[230:35.20]And when people are like, this is boring, or this sucks, this is stupid, I don't like this game.
[230:39.26]And it's not just like three people, it's like hundreds of them.
[230:42.76]It's harder for me to be like, look at how much fun this is!
[230:47.18]Oh, guys, check this out!
[230:47.98]I'm having so much fun!
[230:49.10]Hey, everybody!
[230:51.00]It's a fun time!
[230:52.56]And you guys are not having fun.
[230:56.45]I feed off of people's energy, right?
[230:59.95]Like, I feed off of what you guys say and the things that you guys are laughing about or talking about.
[231:05.59]I'm a creature of that kind of habit.
[231:10.37]He's a demon.
[231:11.42]Call me whatever you want.
[231:14.89]That's what a monster does.
[231:17.13]Call me whatever you want.
[231:20.16]But if I'm not feeling like the chat vibe and I'm not having fun having fun with you guys and having you understand that we're you know having you guys have fun and there needs to be this like mutual kind of understanding that what we're doing is what is fun to do because otherwise it's me just like talking at a wall while people scream about how they hate what I'm doing.
[231:40.81]And it just feels odd.
[231:42.75]Oh, got that power-up.
[231:43.87]Nice.
[231:44.35]Okay, what's that?
[231:45.51]10,000 power-ups?
[231:46.93]This game sucks.
[231:47.59]This game's fucking stupid.
[231:48.87]Jeremy, this is so bad.
[231:50.03]Please do something else.
[231:51.33]God, this sucks.
[231:52.66]So bad.
[231:53.52]Okay, so that's 10,000 points.
[231:56.28]Alright, I guess I'll do a spin move there.
[231:58.10]What are you guys saying?
[231:59.24]What's happening over here?
[232:01.32]Oh, okay.
[232:02.12]That's cool.
[232:02.58]Alright.
[232:03.28]Um, nice.
[232:04.48]So, um, guys, this door here needs to be... Yeah, it's hard for me.
[232:09.99]I feed off of fucking chat.
[232:15.75]The Dreamcast sucks.
[232:17.03]That's different.
[232:18.03]It's different.
[232:23.01]You should do straw polls sometimes to see if chat really enjoys this.
[232:27.39]Yeah, but I also don't want to just hand you guys the keys to my car.
[232:31.35]You know what I mean?
[232:31.89]If I want to do something, and it's something I'm going to plan to do, like, I'm going to do it.
[232:36.75]I'm not going to be like, guys, tell me what to stream every day.
[232:39.58]Like, I have the keys to the car.
[232:43.90]You guys are passengers.
[232:45.96]in this car.
[232:47.66]Now, I can take suggestions for where you guys wanna go.
[232:53.78]But at the end of the day, I'm the one with the wheel in the hand.
[232:58.56]We're in the baby seat.
[232:59.83]Maybe some of you are.
[233:02.03]There's at least one of you that might be.
[233:06.97]But.
[233:11.75]We're not gonna crash, we're fine.
[233:13.83]I've got my eyes on the road.
[233:18.61]But the point still stands is I like having that balance of you guys having recommendations and influencing some of the stuff that's done.
[233:28.36]But it's not just going to be like, I do polls in the pre-stream chat all the time and be like, what do you guys think is, what do you guys want to do today?
[233:35.36]They're like choices that I have made, right?
[233:38.16]Anytime you guys have ever seen a poll, it's always been, here's like three or four things that I would like to do.
[233:45.77]And then you guys are like, oh, do this.
[233:47.01]This sounds good.
[233:47.65]This sounds fun.
[233:48.25]I don't know about that one.
[233:50.11]Those are all things that I want to do, that I like, that I would probably want to do.
[233:52.79]But if I start handing you guys the keys, then...
[233:59.44]It's like I can't really make decisions for myself anymore.
[234:02.51]You know what I mean?
[234:03.01]It's like... Well, I guess I'm not doing this because they told me I can't.
[234:07.09]And I don't want that to ever be a possibility.
[234:10.24]There you go.
[234:12.86]He's gonna turn this car around.
[234:13.96]He is.
[234:18.32]No, you're not getting the keys.
[234:25.43]Why does it smell like piss?
[234:26.48]Because you pissed your pants.
[234:28.26]You're sitting down in a... It's sitting in your own pee.
[234:30.68]You peed your pants in the car.
[234:31.72]Alright, moving on.
[234:38.93]That was Hot Gamer for 500 bits.
[234:40.75]Thank you.
[234:41.43]Miami Hotlines, thanks for 250.
[234:42.87]Hey King, it's me again.
[234:44.11]Heart, your casino is still so ugly I might barf.
[234:47.55]We can add you to the list of the hundreds of people that barfed in the casino.
[234:51.36]So it's really not even a big deal at that point.
[234:55.13]Thanks a lot, though.
[234:57.04]Uh...
[235:29.96]I mean, you can live close to casinos or close to the Strip, but nobody, I mean, unless you're like a celebrity or an athlete or like, uh, boxers or UFC fighters have permanent rooms in some of the hotels down there, but people don't, you don't like live in the Bellagio, you don't like live in Circus Circus.
[235:50.30]You could, but you don't, people, you don't.
[235:54.88]Or a streamer, yeah.
[235:55.90]Yeah.
[236:02.29]Or a straver.
[236:05.03]That'd be so weird.
[236:06.17]I would never want to live in a resort or hotel or something.
[236:10.77]Just think about that.
[236:11.77]Somebody does your laundry.
[236:13.87]Somebody cleans your room every day.
[236:16.01]I would lose so... Oh yeah, somebody's gonna come in and just do a bunch of shit for me in my room.
[236:23.76]If somebody else takes your trash out... I feel like I would become so complacent.
[236:31.68]And then I would just turn into like a slug.
[236:41.84]Because then after like five years of that, it's hard to go back to like doing your own bed and cleaning your own sheets and taking your own trash out.
[236:52.07]Each human slug would be living in a hotel.
[236:55.05]It's true.
[237:02.20]Hey, thank you, Pigeon, for the 500 bits.
[237:04.10]They say, Jerma, read.
[237:05.16]Jerma, the time has come for me to write you a very long letter.
[237:11.33]Okay.
[237:13.83]Let's see.
[237:16.97]I'll be 20 years old tonight.
[237:19.01]Okay.
[237:20.65]Happy birthday at 12 a.m.
[237:26.38]Have a good 12 a.m.
[237:28.10]birthday.
[237:29.00]Bill's birthday, man.
[237:31.09]This marks seven years of my enjoyment of you and your content.
[237:35.21]I've written a letter, I've written a paper about you.
[237:37.27]I've met you in person.
[237:38.31]In fact, the symbol of the moment is now the highlight of my room's decor.
[237:43.12]Yes, you can show this.
[237:44.38]Wait, do you have like a picture of me and... Wait, what is this?
[237:47.56]This is like hanging in your room?
[237:53.83]Oh, sick!
[237:55.71]Oh, there it is.
[237:56.23]Yeah, I'm a signer.
[237:59.75]I sign.
[238:02.50]No, it's not like a picture of my face or something.
[238:07.67]Oh wait, is there one up here?
[238:08.67]No.
[238:10.33]It's a TwitchCon badge.
[238:12.91]It's not like he's got a shrine of my face.
[238:15.93]People are going to make fun of this signature.
[238:22.16]But I'll show it because people are going to... I know, it's bad.
[238:26.78]I have such a shitty handwriting and everything.
[238:33.79]I'll just save this as.
[238:46.25]Where is it?
[238:48.03]Oh, that's the blueprint for Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.
[238:51.52]Okay, there we go.
[238:54.20]Oh, here.
[238:54.66]Look.
[238:55.96]I have really shitty handwriting, and it's kind of hard.
[239:02.63]It's really hard to draw when you're standing up and holding your hand underneath as a pad.
[239:08.93]And I'm very much aware that I know I do a thing under the A, and I didn't know this until very recently, that I just have subconsciously been stealing that from Amazon.
[239:21.98]That's how I do every single one.
[239:24.22]I've signed, probably, if I'm realistic, I don't know, is it 80 things?
[239:30.32]And I always do the thing underneath the A, and it's just fucking Amazon.
[239:38.81]And I just do it.
[239:39.93]I'm just like, oh, Durbo, then, okay, whatever.
[239:41.63]Let's put a smile on that box.
[239:45.15]God damn it.
[239:53.93]And the smi- Well, yeah, I don't know, I just did it.
[239:59.04]They say, Jerma, nobody on the internet can offer what you do.
[240:01.40]Nobody can pretend to.
[240:03.60]You offer a hilarious and personal experience.
[240:06.48]When I watch other streamers, my experience is immediately halted as a bit donation is read as it is given.
[240:13.19]Ironically, reading the donations, which is supposed to serve to make the setting of Twitch chat to streamer more intimate, but instead works to disconnect those who aren't the bit messenger.
[240:21.92]Well, I do have something to say.
[240:23.14]I will tell you this, though.
[240:25.14]That... There probably always will be a disconnect.
[240:32.99]I think that's important to mention, too, and to remember as well.
[240:37.15]That there's always going to be a disconnect.
[240:43.17]Now, it doesn't have to be a situation where I just... Hey, thanks for the $10.
[240:47.93]Okay, bye.
[240:48.39]Right?
[240:49.40]Right?
[240:50.59]But there will always be a disconnect between anybody who's ever really on this channel.
[240:59.85]And Fluter did just say, um, that's not true.
[241:04.15]Plenty of other good streamers.
[241:05.41]That is true too.
[241:06.47]But it's not just I'm the only person on the whole entire website that says thanks in a way or gives some kind of attention in a way to people that give money to the stream.
[241:17.08]There's plenty of people that do that.
[241:19.14]But there always will be a form of a disconnect between anybody on this channel and me.
[241:25.72]That's just kind of the nature of this whole platform.
[241:29.47]But I do kind of see what you're saying.
[241:34.77]What do you mean I'm not as close to people?
[241:37.21]I'm not as close as people to you as in real life.
[241:42.77]Well, my understanding is we all are in this community together.
[241:47.06]This is a big place.
[241:47.84]There's a lot of people here.
[241:50.56]And personal attention is impossible.
[241:53.60]It is.
[241:53.82]I'll be upfront with you.
[241:55.74]It's impossible.
[241:57.92]There's no way for me to give any of you any real personal attention.
[242:04.44]Ever.
[242:08.12]Give me attention!
[242:08.86]Okay, sure!
[242:13.42]But when you have a large community like this, everyone kind of... Everyone kind of is in the same spot.
[242:18.32]And everyone kind of thinks the same things are interesting.
[242:20.98]And just because I can't and won't give anybody personal, personal attention...
[242:28.04]Doesn't mean that we all can't enjoy the same things together and have fun in this space.
[242:31.51]That's what it's for.
[242:35.57]And of course, if you go to a convention and I'm there, we can hang out and shoot this shit for a little bit, right?
[242:43.28]But we're in that same space.
[242:47.96]Disable donations!
[242:51.03]You know, it actually took me a pretty long time to come to terms with stuff like PayPal and Bits and stuff.
[243:00.03]It actually took a long time.
[243:01.73]I never had a PayPal for Bits or anything.
[243:04.81]And when Bits came in, I was very reluctant to turn it on.
[243:12.56]I'm constantly evaluating this stream.
[243:19.56]Like, I've never... It's never... Well, not recently have I thought, oh, maybe I should turn off donations and just, like, let's just hang out, whatever.
[243:30.98]It's under constant evaluation.
[243:33.72]But... I never want this stream to be a scenario... I never want to be in a scenario where people want to pay me money to talk to me.
[243:46.34]It shouldn't be like that.
[243:48.22]You understand me?
[243:50.21]I don't... That never sat well with me.
[244:00.35]And I know that there's a lot of... He hates scenarios.
[244:02.95]I know I said the word scenario.
[244:04.07]Scenario is one of my favorite words.
[244:07.03]It's happening now.
[244:11.12]And that's the thing.
[244:14.04]When you get to a point when that happens...
[244:18.97]That's why I always want to kind of evaluate where I am, and what I'm doing, and how comfortable I am doing the things that I do.
[244:26.69]Remember, I come from YouTube, where I would just make a video, and there it is.
[244:32.94]And if you liked it, you could tell me to fuck- go fuck off somewhere in the comments, but we didn't- it wasn't real time.
[244:40.78]And nobody really sent me any direct personal messages that I addressed in video or anything.
[244:51.55]And then we get to the scenarios- AHHHHH!
[244:54.13]I said it again.
[244:55.11]Then we get to the thing where, because more and more people are on this channel, and more and more people are sending money that I read at the end of streams or read whatever, where let's just say, like you're talking about other streamers, you have to increase- you gotta put some- you gotta put the gate up and make it so it's harder to do because you don't want the whole stream just to be talking to people for money.
[245:21.13]That was one of the main reasons why I moved this to the end of the stream.
[245:25.37]Because I don't... I want to broadcast, and I want to, like I said, collectively do something fun.
[245:31.84]And hang out and have fun.
[245:33.14]And enjoy ourselves together.
[245:35.62]I never wanted this stream to be like, for a dollar, I'm just going to start talking to you.
[245:39.34]You know what I mean?
[245:39.90]I don't want that to... And I hope that doesn't sound like I'm some kind of dickhead or something.
[245:46.21]I really hope it doesn't.
[245:51.81]Oh, this is still... Yes, I do sign shit like that.
[245:54.87]Move this way.
[246:00.95]It sounds like you hate me.
[246:02.02]No.
[246:04.84]I just... I never wanted to get to a position where the stream takes a backseat to just being paid money to just talk to you.
[246:18.64]That's why I took it away from the middle of streams, I put it to the end of streams, I raised the bit amount that needed to be read at the end of streams.
[246:28.71]But that can come off as, well, now he's making us spend more money to say anything to him at all.
[246:39.38]Fuck that, get your money.
[246:41.28]What the fuck?
[246:45.42]No, but this channel already makes a lot of money.
[246:50.20]It does.
[246:51.42]That's very obvious and very plain for anybody to do any basic math to know how many subs this channel has.
[247:01.33]And I don't want to pretend like that's not happening.
[247:05.83]But I also don't want it to become the one thing that matters for me to just drain people to just send me fucking money...
[247:15.36]And I just, hey, thanks for the fucking 20 bucks.
[247:18.40]You got to say the one thing to Jerma.
[247:20.38]See you later.
[247:22.14]So that's why I do like to give some personal attention.
[247:24.10]But then how far does that go?
[247:25.56]How far does that go in that regard, right?
[247:29.74]It's something that I, like I said, I constantly evaluate.
[247:40.21]Quick, clip it and cut the sensible part.
[247:42.49]Oh my God.
[247:44.86]But anyways, they say, uh, Pin says, uh, please keep working hard like you do.
[247:51.90]Know that every important and unimportant birthday, I will somehow make a time to celebrate me stumbling onto your channel all the way back in 2013.
[247:58.77]Thank you.
[248:01.15]Seriously.
[248:02.43]They say, also say, uh, sorry about structure.
[248:04.57]I'm pretty high while I write this.
[248:09.31]It's all good.
[248:11.07]It's all good.
[248:16.41]Dude, fucking, we.
[248:20.67]But I really appreciate it.
[248:21.81]I really do.
[248:23.66]The fact that somebody would write a letter like this to me, it's shocking to me.
[248:30.70]I still have trouble realizing and believing that people think that.
[248:36.71]It's surprising.
[248:38.69]So, thank you for even considering that I'm somehow some major influence in your life.
[248:50.31]Thanks.
[248:51.45]I hope you're taking something good.
[248:54.41]Or I hope it makes you... I don't know.
[248:58.35]Hopefully you can enjoy this stuff going on here.
[249:03.78]And maybe I shape one of your views or something.
[249:08.30]And then I'll be like 70 years old looking back and... I told those kids about that and they started pissing in the shower.
[249:17.65]I remember when I told them that you take a shit for 45 minutes and they didn't believe me and now they do.
[249:23.25]All of them.
[249:28.37]But yeah, it's... It means a lot.
[249:33.89]Thank you.
[249:36.60]Moving on.
[249:37.24]We'll move on now.
[249:39.60]We had... Where am I?
[249:44.14]Right here.
[249:44.46]Gnarly, thanks for 250.
[249:45.66]If you were born in 2000, would you make your username Jerma000?
[249:53.05]Probably.
[249:53.47]That's pretty cool.
[249:58.01]That's cool.
[250:00.73]Yeah.
[250:02.83]Hey, Sharko Supreme, thanks for the $5.
[250:05.23]Floygan Brothers VR waiting room.
[250:11.50]Floygan Brothers VR.
[250:14.98]If Floygan Brothers ever comes back, either video game or television show, I will drink a full vial of piss.
[250:32.47]No, I won't.
[250:32.87]That's TOS.
[250:33.97]I will, um... I will...
[250:49.97]I'll do a sleeping stream.
[250:51.28]I don't know.
[250:52.88]That's never gonna happen, so I'll be fine.
[251:02.02]Hey, AutumnDragons, thanks for the 250.
[251:03.58]Hello, King.
[251:04.18]Can we please watch the original Tom and Jerry cartoons on Amazon Prime?
[251:07.30]Pretty please with cherry on top.
[251:08.78]Thanks, Dad.
[251:11.20]I want to test out the Amazon Prime thing eventually.
[251:13.73]But for this trial run, I'd like to have as many people there as possible.
[251:16.63]More fun that way.
[251:20.23]Thanks for the 250.
[251:22.05]Whole of one zombie thanks for the 250.
[251:23.23]I don't remember titles of files.
[251:26.33]I just have a file on my desktop with like five pictures of your face with your eye slightly moved to the left that I'll laugh at like a lunatic.
[251:37.24]Somewhere, someplace.
[251:39.58]I'm in somebody's files on their computer.
[251:46.79]Nice.
[251:48.88]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250.
[251:50.24]Hey Jeremy, I've been streaming Resident Evil 2 and honestly it's the most fun game I've played in a while.
[251:54.27]The remake or the old one?
[251:56.49]Big difference.
[251:58.99]They need to stick to making their games like that instead of how Resident Evil 5 and 6 were.
[252:03.87]The remake, alright, there you go.
[252:05.91]I think they're leaning now.
[252:07.51]I think they're learning now that they should stick to what they've always been good at.
[252:10.61]Anyways, have a good night.
[252:13.11]Yeah, Resident Evil 4 is really good too, but Resident Evil 3 remake apparently sucks!
[252:17.62]Help me.
[252:18.50]Help me.
[252:19.06]I keep... People tell me that the game's not good.
[252:22.76]It's like a bad game and it's not worth playing.
[252:25.19]I keep... Nobody tells me it's good.
[252:27.29]I think I've heard by maybe one or two accounts that it was like, oh yeah, that's really good.
[252:31.85]Is it good?
[252:32.27]Should I play it?
[252:33.75]It's not... Is it good?
[252:37.99]It's fucking great.
[252:38.97]It's good.
[252:39.59]It sucks.
[252:41.01]It's worth playing once.
[252:42.56]It's not as good as two, but it's good.
[252:44.32]It's short.
[252:44.84]It's decent.
[252:45.36]Who the fuck cares?
[252:46.96]It's good.
[252:47.40]Resident PP.
[252:48.92]Form your own opinion, sheep.
[252:51.30]It's good, but short.
[252:52.54]Eat my ass.
[252:54.84]Cash grab.
[252:56.26]Omega low.
[252:57.08]It's okay.
[252:57.82]Who the fuck cares?
[252:58.98]It's not that, and it's short.
[253:00.11]Alright, I got a pretty good indicator of what chat thinks about it.
[253:04.21]Maybe I'll play it.
[253:11.39]Hey, Goikee, thanks for the $50!
[253:12.81]Haha, almost at 45% share in gambling.
[253:16.95]Keepo happy.
[253:18.83]Yeah, I was pretty close to, like, beating the game.
[253:20.81]That's probably when you beat the game.
[253:23.53]But then we spawned 100 hitmen, and they started shooting each other.
[253:27.48]That was where it had to end.
[253:29.44]Thanks for the 5 fucking thousand bits.
[253:33.22]Huge money, thank you.
[253:35.94]Goikee, another one that just contributes huge money to the stream every time.
[253:40.99]BlueDKRF, thanks for the $6.
[253:43.31]Thanks for being one of my favorite streamers.
[253:44.85]Thanks for being one of my viewers.
[253:46.55]I've always said favorite viewers, but then I would have made a lot of people probably really sad.
[253:52.43]Thanks for being one of the... Thanks for being here.
[253:54.67]Thanks for the $6.
[253:55.67]Even in these times when I'm considered an essential worker in a hospital, you've been amazing for making things more enjoyable and getting me to laugh for a while with what's going on.
[254:06.70]You're very essential.
[254:09.79]We gotta give it up to the hospital workers.
[254:14.09]They are doing double fucking time.
[254:21.67]Without people like you, the whole world would be fucked forever.
[254:26.97]So thanks.
[254:38.04]And thanks for the $6.
[254:38.56]Appreciate it.
[254:42.16]Geolove, thanks for the $12.
[254:44.22]Wallace and Gromit.
[254:46.24]I don't think Wallace and Gromit is public domain.
[254:52.46]It's not public domain.
[254:53.50]We could probably watch, like, the Rube Goldberg machine opening.
[254:56.98]Where, like, it goes like, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-d
[255:08.38]Isn't it?
[255:09.18]That's the beginning to Pee-Wee Herman.
[255:10.94]That's Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.
[255:13.23]Yeah, okay.
[255:14.57]Is that in public domain?
[255:15.41]That's a great one.
[255:16.11]That's one of the best movies ever.
[255:20.09]Pee-Wee's Big Adventure is one of the best movies ever made.
[255:23.25]That's too bad.
[255:25.79]Go watch it if you've never seen it.
[255:26.69]It's great.
[255:30.34]That's one of the... You want to talk about, like, put it in the wiki?
[255:33.48]The lore?
[255:34.06]Yeah.
[255:35.62]That movie is one of the reasons why I'm such a fucking weirdo.
[255:41.47]I'm a very, very highly influenced from Pee Wee Herman's movie.
[255:49.57]Like, extreme influence from Pee Wee Herman.
[255:56.32]I say we stab him, and then we gut him, and then we hang him, and then we kill him!
[256:05.16]I say let him go!
[256:11.26]It's one of the classic parts of that movie.
[256:13.22]If you've never seen it, maybe you'll think it's funny.
[256:19.14]You make this joke like 10 times a year.
[256:21.68]Yeah, I know because it's so good.
[256:24.84]It's so funny.
[256:26.02]It's like total perfect.
[256:28.26]The scene is perfect comedy.
[256:30.72]He knocks all his fucking bikes over and they try to kill him.
[256:34.39]And then he dances.
[256:36.29]He does the dance to the tequila song and all of a sudden everybody loves him.
[256:39.23]That is peak comedy.
[256:40.21]That's peak humor.
[256:41.93]And I refuse to believe that it's not.
[256:51.82]Tell a large bar and send ya.
[256:54.76]Oh, and by the way... Yep.
[256:58.78]It's the scariest face ever and I was scared of it when I was a kid.
[257:09.04]Large Marge.
[257:12.02]Large Marge.
[257:13.28]That's like a Jerma Rumble character.
[257:15.65]You know what I'm saying?
[257:16.27]I'm only here for the drops.
[257:22.01]Can you turn them on?
[257:23.01]What?
[257:23.97]Do I have drops on my channel?
[257:25.50]How do I give it to you?
[257:26.36]Here, you can have one, I guess.
[257:27.58]How do I do it?
[257:32.27]Hey, SoupGG, thanks for the $2.50.
[257:33.79]Jerma, please seriously consider watching Plan 9 from Outer Space.
[257:37.39]It's a notoriously bad 1950s sci-fi horror, and it's the first so bad it's a good movie.
[257:42.32]It's hilarious.
[257:42.96]I think you'll love it.
[257:43.72]I thank you, Chief.
[257:46.08]It's on the list.
[257:48.08]I've got it on the list right here.
[257:50.84]Thanks for the $2.50.
[257:51.36]Kooskoos, thanks for $2.50.
[257:54.32]Jerma, you watch movies like I watch your streams.
[257:56.96]99% background noise, 1% wondering what the hell is going on.
[258:01.69]Not a bad way to watch.
[258:02.47]Let's get those credits rolling.
[258:08.72]All the subs.
[258:12.58]If I can figure out how to do it.
[258:14.12]What the heck is it?
[258:18.71]What the heck?
[258:19.13]What the heck?
[258:19.87]What the heck?
[258:20.25]What the heck?
[258:21.13]What the heck?
[258:21.73]Oh my god, what the heck?
[258:25.39]What?
[258:25.93]What the heck?
[258:31.95]I lost it.
[258:32.45]What the heck?
[258:42.37]Idiot.
[258:43.75]Idiot.
[258:45.18]Pauline Dineway.
[258:45.86]Remember when everyone loved that thing for like two years?
[258:49.62]Idiot.
[258:49.88]Isn't that coming back?
[258:58.64]Am I wrong?
[258:59.28]Aren't they doing, like, another Napoleon Diamond?
[259:01.44]Isn't there, like, another one they're doing?
[259:02.72]I think they're actually doing that.
[259:07.61]It was funny when it came out.
[259:09.37]Um, okay, I just, like, reached behind me.
[259:12.11]And on the chair.
[259:14.85]So, I just reached behind me.
[259:19.53]And sitting on the chair, I was like, what the fuck have I been sitting on?
[259:23.75]Because I haven't gotten up, really.
[259:25.11]I was like, what am I sitting on?
[259:26.88]And I pulled this out.
[259:28.40]It's the Universal Studios GameCube game I was sitting on at the whole stream.
[259:34.84]That's weird.
[259:40.31]I was wondering, like, something is weird and cold and doesn't feel right.
[259:43.97]And I didn't move it.
[259:46.93]Oh, right, right, right.
[259:47.89]The subs.
[259:50.09]Rollo.
[259:51.73]Thanks for stopping, everybody.
[259:53.19]As always.
[259:53.77]Thanks for being in the oil.
[259:58.07]That makes the stream move forward.
[260:02.08]Is that the joke?
[260:02.76]No.
[260:04.24]It was real life.
[260:07.08]Thanks, everybody.
[260:10.94]Appreciate it.
[260:15.38]Uh, you can watch that on your own time.
[260:16.66]Thanks for the $2.50, though.
[260:33.46]Hey, Peaceful Haley, thanks for 250.
[260:34.66]Hey, again!
[260:35.24]There is a maybe transparent image of the MST3K silhouettes.
[260:39.54]I don't know what you plan on doing for movie night, but something like that would be funny.
[260:44.38]Just, like, half of me sitting in the seat.
[260:50.51]I wonder if that, like, could I just, could I do that?
[260:52.69]I still have, like, a camera pointed at the back of my head.
[261:00.90]Oh, don't give me ideas.
[261:01.96]I would want to, like, set a bunch of dumb shit.
[261:10.57]Just have, like, popcorn and, like, fucking throw it at the screen.
[261:13.27]This movie sucks!
[261:15.97]Alright, well, we'll see.
[261:16.85]Let's see if I have enough time to get some of that shit done.
[261:22.77]That's fucking funny, though.
[261:24.07]That's a good idea.
[261:25.47]Thanks for the $2.50.
[261:26.07]Thanks for the idea, Hayley.
[261:29.32]Snooze and Copter, thanks for the $2.50.
[261:30.32]Hey, remember who I am?
[261:31.48]That's right.
[261:31.92]I'm your long-lost brother.
[261:33.74]That wouldn't be the first thing you forgot, now is it?
[261:36.14]I have God Hand over, and it's crying on my couch because you won't play it.
[261:41.60]But hold on.
[261:42.38]If you can pronounce Burgundy correctly, you don't have to play God Hand.
[261:45.63]I know it's your weakness.
[261:46.49]I just pronounced it correctly.
[261:52.69]Thank you.
[261:55.23]It's Burgundy.
[261:59.81]Well, uh, I, uh, think I got it right.
[262:05.71]I'm still gonna play God Hand, though, because, uh, you know, uh, thanks for the tip.
[262:11.44]Hey, Fitty, thanks for the $2.50.
[262:12.92]It's La Mayo, dude, not LMAO.
[262:17.62]Uh, Potato Potato?
[262:20.41]Hey, The Plushie, thanks for the $2.50.
[262:23.55]Jeremy, you may not remember, but you gave me some advice a few months ago, and you said you'd try to stream for my birthday a few days ago.
[262:29.43]This is the guy!
[262:30.09]I wanted to let you know that after that first one, I wrote a message I wanted to give you, but I couldn't find any way to contact you, and couldn't get anyone to pass the message along.
[262:38.80]I'm too embarrassed to send it now, but basically it said how you helped me through a very tough, if not the toughest time in my life, even if you don't know it.
[262:46.87]Happy birthday!
[262:49.67]This is the, this is no, this is the guy that you lied to.
[262:52.72]The guy he lied to you.
[262:54.00]No, I didn't.
[262:55.72]I said I was maybe gonna stream on Monday.
[262:57.76]I was thinking about streaming Monday.
[262:58.84]It was probably gonna be stream on Monday, but there's not gonna be a stream on Monday.
[263:02.04]I'm gonna be here in the chat.
[263:03.49]I can say happy birthday in the chat.
[263:05.37]I will.
[263:05.97]I'll be here on Monday at exactly the time that the stream is supposed to start.
[263:09.99]I can say happy birthday.
[263:12.37]Happy birthday chat stream chat message.
[263:18.00]Who's LMFAO?
[263:20.05]What?
[263:25.09]We'll all be there.
[263:27.29]You gave him a lie for his birthday.
[263:29.03]I did not.
[263:30.21]I am gonna be there.
[263:31.91]I just, though I won't be on the camera and there won't be a stream going.
[263:35.23]I'll be in the chat.
[263:36.89]For at least a few minutes.
[263:41.74]He hates birthdays.
[263:42.72]I don't hate birthdays.
[263:44.02]I love birthdays.
[263:44.92]Especially good ones.
[263:46.46]Like, everyone is here.
[263:50.49]Liar, liar, liar, liar.
[263:54.14]Oh, thank you, plushie.
[263:56.25]Appreciate it.
[263:58.40]Happy birthday.
[263:59.70]And I'll see you on Monday.
[264:00.58]Happy birthday on Monday.
[264:01.59]We'll see you on Monday.
[264:02.45]Pixel Mike, thanks for the $5.
[264:03.51]Hey, Jerma, someone on the sub is saying, I was breaking sub rules by asking you to stop playing Beautiful Joe.
[264:09.99]I just want to apologize for trashing the game super hard.
[264:13.39]But like you just said, it really wasn't fun for me.
[264:15.63]And a lot of chat, apparently.
[264:16.64]But it was just, it looked like one of those games that's more fun to play than stream.
[264:20.30]Regardless, have a good one.
[264:22.24]You're in big, big trouble.
[264:24.40]You're in big trouble.
[264:25.32]Big, big trouble.
[264:27.06]Big, big trouble.
[264:38.61]Run.
[264:38.93]He's running.
[264:39.35]He's running!
[264:39.81]He's running!
[264:43.73]Come here.
[264:43.97]Come here!
[264:45.47]Stop!
[264:46.43]Stop.
[264:46.73]There he is.
[264:47.21]You stopped.
[264:50.23]How dare you.
[264:53.49]That's all I had to say.
[264:58.10]Now you can get off.
[264:58.94]Get out of the car.
[265:00.14]Get out of the train.
[265:01.22]Wherever you're going.
[265:01.90]Bye-bye.
[265:10.88]Bye.
[265:11.10]Yep.
[265:11.34]See ya.
[265:14.80]See you next stream, man.
[265:21.16]Ah.
[265:21.32]I like that guy.
[265:22.83]That guy's fun.
[265:27.25]Hey.
[265:30.73]Friedl Schlitz.
[265:33.38]Thanks for the $2.50.
[265:33.72]You should definitely look into Buster Keaton.
[265:38.73]He's a silent comedy legend on the same level as Charlie Chaplin or Harold Lloyd.
[265:43.69]Add reefer madness to the movie list.
[265:46.83]Check it out.
[265:54.99]I already own that game, actually, to be honest with you.
[265:57.33]It's... I was gonna play it a long time ago, but it just sat in my Steam library.
[266:00.23]Thought you might like it.
[266:01.73]I would just throw it in there.
[266:02.70]Just throw it in there.
[266:03.36]Just go... Copy-paste.
[266:03.76]Somebody will get it.
[266:05.10]Death Road to Canada.
[266:28.27]Give it to me.
[266:28.95]Give it to me.
[266:32.03]Replace a letter or a bot will get it.
[266:34.79]Yeah.
[266:36.48]So copy the code and change one of the numbers of letters to a different letter.
[266:45.64]There's bots.
[266:47.04]How would a bot just... That's crazy.
[266:51.71]Can of Sean's, thanks for the $2.50.
[266:54.02]If you're ever seeing that you enjoyed Beautiful Joe, I'd recommend you watch Dead Leaves.
[266:58.66]It's a pretty nice short that sort of fits the vibe of that game.
[267:04.53]Or Redline.
[267:05.15]People have told me to do Redline and watch Redline.
[267:07.95]It's just another neat movie.
[267:08.99]Anyway, have a good one.
[267:11.19]I have gotten recommendations to watch Redline.
[267:15.03]I wonder if it's any good.
[267:17.05]I'll add Dead Leaves to the list of the animated shows that I'm allowed to watch each year.
[267:21.88]That's one.
[267:24.10]And by the way, I already watched seasons 1 through 4 of SpongeBob.
[267:27.46]So, running out of some space.
[267:35.51]Hey, DubskyDude, thanks for the $2.50.
[267:36.67]I've noticed more people suggesting games and chat being unruly with your game choices.
[267:42.39]No offense, but I think it's because you've only been playing Boomer games in the past two months.
[267:46.15]I think doing a Strawpoll YouPick streams once or twice a month could help.
[267:50.53]Well, also, no games have come out for the last three months.
[267:55.80]Besides, like, the last week.
[267:58.16]What games have come out in the last two or three months?
[268:04.19]Doom, Animal Crossing.
[268:05.19]Yeah, but I've thought, like, when did Doom come out?
[268:11.51]Why would I play the Final Fantasy VII Remake?
[268:14.39]Have you ever heard me ever... All I've said... All I've done is talk shit about that game.
[268:31.55]There are new people here.
[268:34.33]No, not to get... I gotta rephrase that.
[268:39.12]All I've done is make fun of the trailers.
[268:42.08]And tell you how I don't play Final Fantasy.
[268:46.54]I'm not gonna play Final Fantasy VII Remake.
[268:53.49]I didn't pay five bucks for this bullshit.
[268:59.50]I just... I... It's a... What a fantastic... Okay, Backtrack and Barry coming in.
[269:05.27]Hold on a minute.
[269:19.94]Final Fantasy is one of the most influential, most respected series ever.
[269:26.30]Ever.
[269:27.52]Ever.
[269:30.73]But I never played them.
[269:32.87]Never got into them.
[269:34.75]I actually really don't like turn-based RPGs.
[269:39.95]I find them boring.
[269:41.50]They kind of bore me.
[269:43.08]And that's not just with Final Fantasy.
[269:44.98]That's with everything that is a turn-based RPG.
[269:48.12]I'm just not into them.
[269:49.84]I need a laser beam to go... I need dodge rolls.
[269:54.22]I need FPS.
[269:55.86]I need blood.
[269:58.01]I need characters that have funny voices.
[270:02.05]I don't got time to wait for an attack.
[270:10.29]What about Chrono Trigger is the best game ever made?
[270:14.08]It is.
[270:14.32]Super Mario RPG is the best game ever made?
[270:18.56]It is.
[270:18.78]Those are both turn-based RPGs.
[270:22.62]They are.
[270:32.09]I know.
[270:33.23]What you thinking?
[270:35.26]Jermo, how could you say something like that?
[270:38.68]And, uh, man.
[270:41.60]Have that opinion.
[270:43.08]When you love those games so much.
[270:45.04]Aw, I had to close my window.
[270:56.59]Hold on.
[271:08.23]Okay, listen.
[271:09.61]Important.
[271:13.56]Turn-based RPGs, they gotta really do it for me.
[271:15.90]Chrono Trigger's one of the only ones.
[271:17.12]Super Mario RPGs are one of the only ones.
[271:19.48]Good.
[271:19.80]You named the only two turn-based RPGs that I actually liked to play.
[271:26.99]Those are the only two.
[271:30.45]You haven't played that many.
[271:31.23]Yes, I have.
[271:32.40]I've played Golden Sun.
[271:33.82]I've played Final Fantasy 1, 2, 3, 4.
[271:36.74]I've played Final Fantasy 10.
[271:38.74]I've played... Advance Wars.
[271:42.54]I've played... What do you mean that's a war?
[271:48.37]What are you talking about?
[271:49.29]Golden Sun is a bad one?
[271:54.41]I've played...
[271:58.93]I'm not googling.
[271:59.73]What do you mean googling?
[272:00.93]What if I googled?
[272:01.67]I'm sitting here this whole time.
[272:02.71]I was not into Final Fantasy.
[272:07.14]I... Final Fa... Look.
[272:10.46]Let me ask you this.
[272:11.58]The one reason why I was going to play Final Fantasy VII, and I don't know if this is a spoiler for anybody or not, but I don't want it to... Did they remove... It's a spoiler for a remade fucking game.
[272:24.50]It's like saying Charlie wins and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory at the end of the movie.
[272:30.28]Who the fuck doesn't know that by now?
[272:31.93]There's memes about it.
[272:32.73]They deleted one of my favorite characters.
[272:37.43]They deleted the only character I care about.
[272:51.01]It was a book in the 60s.
[272:52.89]It was a movie in the 70s or 80s.
[272:55.91]And then there was another movie in 2002.
[272:57.77]And every meme with Willy Wonka.
[273:03.09]You get nothing.
[273:03.91]Good day, sir.
[273:05.15]You've read that.
[273:06.09]You know that story already.
[273:14.22]When did Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 2 come out?
[273:17.48]The squeakquel.
[273:30.03]Remember, you spoiled.
[273:32.07]If you didn't think that ch- It's like a kid's movie!
[273:36.56]What did you th- Oh, guy- guys!
[273:38.32]Oh, I got another spoiler for you.
[273:39.92]Um, in the movie Cars 2... Oh, Lightning McQueen!
[273:43.75]He w- Oh, he wins that race in the end.
[273:47.41]What?! !
[273:50.05]unpredictable there's no way that lightly mcqueen wins the race at the end versus the evil villain no the movie was made by Disney channel for eight year olds I thought there I thought lightning mcqueen's car was gonna explode and his head was gonna get thrown off into the stands I thought that's what was gonna happen
[274:18.10]What do you mean he's in the car?
[274:19.92]He is the car?
[274:24.02]Wait, he is the... Wait, is somebody driving the car?
[274:28.42]No, they're just cars.
[274:29.47]Well, whatever, same thing.
[274:32.47]Lightning McQueen doesn't get out and he's like, it's me, Lightning McQueen.
[274:35.97]Oh, they have mouths and their mouths talk.
[274:37.95]Yes.
[274:38.75]Well, who knows?
[274:39.09]It could have been a fucking, like, I could have been like this.
[274:41.77]Hey, it's me, Lightning McQueen, talking through the...
[274:47.52]You didn't know?
[274:48.58]Why would I watch cars?
[274:50.18]I've watched the good one.
[274:51.38]Planes, dude.
[275:04.08]I'm just kidding.
[275:05.22]Fucking Willy Wonka.
[275:07.14]Willy Wonka at the end of the movie puts his battery acid into the chocolate factory thing and gets arrested.
[275:20.10]Where were we?
[275:20.46]Where are we doing?
[275:21.25]What was the point of this?
[275:23.25]Oh, right.
[275:23.73]Final Fantasy VII.
[275:24.29]I'm not going to play it.
[275:26.53]I respect it.
[275:26.97]I'm not going to play it, though.
[275:35.09]It's not turn-based.
[275:38.80]Ugh.
[275:39.22]I... Isn't that game, like, 75 hours long?
[275:53.36]No.
[275:56.03]40.
[275:56.09]It's 35 to 40 hours.
[275:58.15]I'll lose interest.
[276:00.63]You know how quickly I'm going to lose interest from walking down a hall?
[276:05.73]Watch out!
[276:20.39]okay let me go back what's that over there hey watch out I got you kid hey heads up
[276:47.82]After that a thousandth time?
[276:51.41]I'm gonna stop.
[277:01.45]That doesn't mean it's a bad game.
[277:02.79]That doesn't mean I don't respect the franchise.
[277:05.51]It is one of the best, most influential fucking incredible franchises in the history of video games.
[277:10.70]It's the reason... It's the reason why you have some of your games today.
[277:14.84]It's because Final Fantasy paved the way for fucking everything.
[277:18.76]It's like the Dungeons & Dragons of modern fucking video games and RPGs and shit.
[277:24.80]I know.
[277:26.36]I know.
[277:27.04]Trust me, I do.
[277:28.08]I love it.
[277:29.68]This is just to prevent anybody from throwing a rock at my house.
[277:43.76]That's Dragon Quest?
[277:49.15]Yo, the remake is hot.
[277:50.49]You have to play it.
[277:53.11]Okay, here's the thing.
[277:54.05]If I play the remake and I really love it, I will... I'm gonna be eating my words all stream.
[277:59.38]I'm gonna be like, wow, this is so much fun.
[278:01.26]This game is fucking awesome.
[278:03.12]Holy shit, this is so good.
[278:04.76]And then, like, I will be the bad guy.
[278:10.06]I'll be the bad guy and I will admit it and I will say, guys, I am so fucking wrong.
[278:15.64]I was so incorrect, and I will heavily apologize.
[278:20.32]I will say I'm so sorry for ever saying that I didn't think I was going to like this game.
[278:31.27]Omegalo Cope doesn't want to be wrong.
[278:38.07]It's a nice demo.
[278:42.08]egomaniac won't risk being wrong.
[278:44.64]Lie and pretend you hate it.
[278:46.78]Why would I pretend to hate something that I like?
[278:48.92]Okay, here's what I'll do.
[278:49.68]Are you ready?
[278:54.36]I will play.
[278:55.80]No, fuck, no!
[278:58.29]I will... I'm gonna play the demo off-stream.
[279:11.14]And then I'm going to come back and either apologize at the beginning of next stream, or I'm going to be like, yeah, I'm not into it.
[279:19.38]And that's okay.
[279:24.38]And that's okay.
[279:24.98]I don't even know how we got here.
[279:28.71]Oh, let's talk about new games.
[279:30.93]I'm going to play Doom.
[279:35.15]I have so many things I want to do.
[279:38.23]That's the right answer.
[279:38.99]Apology inbound.
[279:44.86]Valorant.
[279:45.44]I think my brain might be too small for Valorant.
[279:47.48]Plus, you need to get a secret key.
[279:51.98]You need to get a secret... How do I get a key for Valorant?
[280:00.19]Don't play Valorant.
[280:01.29]No, don't play.
[280:02.19]They would give you a key.
[280:07.05]Is it any good?
[280:08.39]Is Valorant any good, or is it just like a... Is it just like a cartoon CS:GO?
[280:27.60]Don't play it.
[280:35.25]It's called it's cock strike.
[280:48.98]God.
[280:52.53]Anyway, I'm not going to lie, Final Fantasy VII.
[280:54.61]Final Fantasy VII is a good franchise.
[280:56.47]Final Fantasy.
[280:57.31]I'm not going to lie.
[280:59.03]I don't think I like it.
[281:00.71]Moving on.
[281:03.27]Hey, SticksRenegade, thanks for the $2.50 hot take.
[281:05.28]Jackie Chan's Stuntmaster is greater than Resident Evil 3.
[281:09.18]I would put a rock defense up in front of your house.
[281:14.44]Hey, Dinosaurus Rex, thanks for the 250.
[281:16.21]Also, how did you develop so much confidence?
[281:18.69]Confidence is something I've been struggling with for a while now, and I wanted to develop more of it.
[281:22.35]Any advice for me in the rest of the chat?
[281:25.82]I think I'm just, honestly, I think I'm just too fucked up to even care.
[281:31.46]Does that actually make any sense?
[281:40.27]I feel like I don't even think about like confidence or anything at this point.
[281:45.24]Because I'm so, my brain is so all over the place.
[281:50.72]I don't have time to even think about it.
[281:53.26]I don't even think I am that confident.
[281:57.03]Considering Backtrack Barry just told you like four different things about the Final Fantasy series in the span of about five minutes.
[282:09.03]Is that confidence or is that... I'm not sure.
[282:17.37]No shame.
[282:18.93]That's a lack of shame.
[282:20.99]He's too stupid to be shy.
[282:29.79]I think here's where it is.
[282:31.39]Ready?
[282:32.71]It's comfortable.
[282:34.21]It's being comfortable.
[282:35.64]Confidence comes from comfort.
[282:37.48]Because you are comfortable in any scenario that you can put yourself in.
[282:43.72]And how you get yourself more comfortable is the real question.
[282:49.91]Music is gone.
[282:51.01]MonkaS.
[282:55.31]Having no shame makes you a psychopath.
[283:00.18]I took the psychopath test.
[283:01.26]I'm only like 60... I'm only like 62% psychopath or something.
[283:09.42]I'm fucking 38% angel.
[283:13.68]Okay?
[283:13.96]The test was $150.
[283:16.88]Got it online.
[283:22.54]But how do you build confidence?
[283:24.64]You just have to be comfortable in the thing that you're doing.
[283:28.37]And that takes time.
[283:30.49]Takes time.
[283:33.09]That's really the only advice I can give you because I'm something wrong with it.
[283:42.06]I skipped a bunch of bits here.
[283:44.38]John Cena is killed thanks to $3.
[283:46.68]I missed the whole stream because of work.
[283:47.87]Can you do the whole thing again?
[283:48.81]I don't want to be a VOD watcher.
[283:51.51]That's an easy solution.
[283:52.51]Just watch the VOD and pretend like it's live.
[283:57.62]And just do like chores or something so you can't like chat.
[284:02.21]I can't chat tonight because I'm doing chores.
[284:04.81]There you go.
[284:08.23]Hey, subwob.
[284:09.55]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[284:10.76]Seven years ago, I saw your H1Z1 video for the first time.
[284:14.26]And... Hold on.
[284:16.46]Ugh.
[284:17.85]Sorry, when I, like, have, like, a burp in my chest and I have to... It kind of hurts.
[284:22.37]Because it goes like... I saw your H1Z1 video for the first time and you've inspired me since.
[284:28.83]You pushed me to experiment in ways I'd never imagined, leading me to get into a college I thought it would be impossible.
[284:35.34]Thanks for all the laughs and positive vibes.
[284:39.00]Oh, good to hear that you got into the college that you wanted to get into, it sounds like.
[284:44.42]Thanks for watching for seven years.
[284:45.62]That video was a fun one.
[284:50.21]Playing that game was a ton of fun.
[284:52.19]I think that's... Me and Star will be able to tell you that was some of the most fun we probably had in a while playing that game.
[284:58.45]A lot of fun.
[285:03.20]Well, good luck to you.
[285:04.34]Thanks for the five dollars.
[285:07.59]God, yes!
[285:08.19]Okay, this is proof.
[285:09.39]People are thinking that I'm making that up.
[285:37.68]For those of you that think that this is bullshit.
[285:41.86]It's not.
[285:43.82]It's not.
[285:57.62]Ah, classic Jerva swoosh.
[286:00.42]We have to do something else.
[286:04.40]Yeah, I remember.
[286:04.96]I remember you taking all that out of your backpack.
[286:08.77]This is really, really cool.
[286:12.68]Thanks for the 1500 bits.
[286:18.97]Hey, Pigeon!
[286:19.55]Thanks for the 250.
[286:21.93]The fact that you have a hard time grasping the amount of positive effects on your viewers' lives is the reason that I keep donating and writing.
[286:31.87]I just like having a good time, man.
[286:34.09]I just like fucking having fun.
[286:35.91]That's it.
[286:37.63]That's it.
[286:37.91]That's all I'm doing here.
[286:39.61]I don't have any other reasons to be here besides, hey, how do we have fun today?
[286:45.19]And yeah, I mean, people pay a shitload of money every month.
[286:49.32]It's a lot of money.
[286:51.67]But I never want that to be like the, hey, and give me more money to talk to me.
[286:55.77]Give me more money.
[286:56.41]Pay me money to talk.
[286:57.33]You are going to pay me to talk.
[286:58.71]You just paid money during the stream.
[287:00.12]Let's have a conversation, you and me.
[287:01.94]Thanks for the $10, $20.
[287:05.72]I like to focus on what I want to do.
[287:12.84]What are you, what, you're spamming something?
[287:15.18]I'm getting more link spam and I told you I didn't like that.
[287:20.45]He looks like Jerma.
[287:23.15]Wait, what?
[287:26.05]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[287:28.93]What the fuck?
[287:33.97]Cut the music.
[287:36.43]Cut the music.
[287:37.03]Cut the music.
[287:54.29]He looks like Jerma.
[287:56.73]Wait.
[288:02.30]A little bit.
[288:08.18]Oh no.
[288:10.62]What happened to him?
[288:15.44]Am I dead?
[288:16.86]After the carnival stream.
[288:22.08]I'm not poisoned.
[288:26.65]I'm fine.
[288:27.11]I'm going to get up and I'm going to be just fine.
[288:28.75]I'm going to get up and I'm going to be stronger than ever.
[288:31.59]I'm going to beat the shit out of Cloud.
[288:33.33]I'm going to get up and I'm going to fucking haymaker Cloud once in the face and break his jaw.
[288:39.53]I'm going to be the most powerful person in Final Fantasy 7.
[288:43.87]God damn it.
[288:55.87]I gotta get a haircut.
[288:56.93]I'm gonna get a haircut and I'm gonna get a different shirt.
[288:58.84]I don't want to be the guy in every game.
[289:00.86]You know what I mean?
[289:03.66]I'm gonna give myself a Hulk Hogan after this.
[289:10.49]Anyways.
[289:16.41]You secretly want to do that.
[289:17.79]Kind of.
[289:18.23]It's fun.
[289:20.19]Anyways.
[289:21.30]Let's keep going.
[289:24.67]Uh, that was just in the chat.
[289:28.90]Stix Renegade, uh, we got that one about John, uh, Junk, uh, Junkie, no, Jackie Chan.
[289:36.31]Stunt Simulator, whatever the fucking game is called.
[289:42.91]Shit.
[289:44.10]Thank you for the $2.50.
[289:47.97]Hey, Silent Serenity, thanks for the 250.
[289:49.79]Hey, King, it's me, your favorite viewer.
[289:51.61]Do you think you could make a motivational tape for us?
[289:54.35]Like, cheers to you, Jerma Edition.
[289:56.84]Chat productivity would increase by 200%.
[289:58.72]That might be fun to do.
[290:04.16]Maybe, yeah.
[290:04.76]If I have some time, I would do it for fun.
[290:08.80]Hey, Emberwisp, thanks for the $5.
[290:10.04]Hey, thanks for streaming.
[290:12.26]It's my birthday today, but because of isolation, I couldn't do much.
[290:16.04]It was nice to have a distraction instead of being alone, and sorry for myself.

[291:15.22]I hurt myself laughing today.
[291:18.40]I have to put like a... a device in my body that once I start laughing hard enough it just like turns it off.
[291:33.63]Somehow.
[291:37.57]But we have a few more bits to do before we say our final goodbye.
[291:43.44]guillotine somebody said put a bomb collar uh so you want you want my head to explode that's not good guillotine senpai thanks for the five dollars the first video of yours I watched four years ago
[292:08.16]It was the Naked Firewatch video.
[292:10.68]I watched it 10 times.
[292:12.72]It was so Bernie Pug.
[292:15.26]Then I watched almost your entire channel.
[292:17.46]And then I cried when I realized you hadn't uploaded anything in like a year.
[292:21.82]Then I found Second Jerma, watched almost every video, and eventually actually started watching you stream.
[292:26.70]Before I kind of thought streaming was weird and wouldn't be as fun as YouTube vids.
[292:31.09]I was a genuine fool.
[292:33.35]Gotta love ADHD.
[292:34.67]And you.
[292:36.67]Oh, that's a Bernie Pog moment right there.
[292:40.13]Uh, yeah.
[292:42.79]The second channel does a lot of great stuff.
[292:46.02]Main channel's still there.
[292:47.60]There's almost 800 videos on that channel, I think, still.
[292:51.78]It's gonna be a nice... It's gonna be a nice, uh, archaeological dig site.
[292:59.09]Thanks for watching, thanks for stopping by, and maybe you'll catch some more streams if now you don't think it's weird.

[293:34.38]Thank you.
[293:35.52]I found your Twitch and now I watch every stream.
[293:38.10]A lot of stuff's been going on in my life because of the pandemic.

[293:56.53]Is that accurate?
[294:03.94]Wow.
[294:05.40]I'll have to look into that, because that's the ultimate quelling of the Dru crew.
[294:09.83]That's the ultimate thirst quencher of the Dru crew, I think.
[294:14.37]If that's real.
[294:15.88]It's going on the list.
[294:18.36]But yeah, happy birthday to your brother.

[294:25.09]Uh, Geolove, thanks for the 300 bits.
[294:27.05]Jerma, I was wondering, but will you be interested in playing any more point-and-click adventures?
[294:31.19]Maybe you playing The Neverhood could be a fun stream.
[294:33.77]Anyway, thanks for these streams.
[294:34.71]They are really fun to watch.
[294:37.85]If I played The Neverhood, it would be one of those me just clicking in all the places I know where to click and talking about how much I love the game.
[294:46.75]Although there are a couple of genuine impossible puzzles in The Neverhood that require a piece of paper, even if you played the game a thousand times.
[294:57.00]But there is a bug in the middle of the game that I would need to circumvent somehow.
[295:02.96]Yeah.
[295:04.18]Maybe.
[295:05.65]I'm not against that idea.
[295:08.03]Those games are a lot of fun.
[295:13.07]We'll see.
[295:13.47]Maybe we'll do another... Didn't we do like a week of point-and-click games at some point?
[295:16.75]Maybe we'll do another one.
