[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.18]Late.
[00:03.46]I actually just walked in here.
[00:08.11]Just moving some stuff around.
[00:09.15]I went to the bathroom.
[00:12.47]And saw the time.
[00:13.71]I saw it was 3.59.
[00:14.53]And I said, oh fuck.
[00:16.44]And I pressed the button.
[00:21.32]I ain't even fucking ready.
[00:24.74]But I'm gonna press it.
[00:32.51]That was an awful little laugh.
[00:33.97]What are you talking about?
[00:37.29]You've been doing this all week.
[00:38.43]Hey, I was live at 1115 yesterday.
[00:48.04]The window was 11 to 12 yesterday and I was there at 1115.
[00:50.26]Right?
[01:01.74]Yeah, but that was yesterday.
[01:02.70]This is today.
[01:08.66]The one time you're early.
[01:10.16]Look, there is no early or late anymore.
[01:13.16]There is between three and four.
[01:15.50]That's it.
[01:17.24]Might start at three, might start at four.
[01:19.66]Just gives me that window, so it doesn't matter.
[01:22.46]Usually, though, all jokes aside, usually, though, if you look back at the last three or four weeks...
[01:30.79]It's usually been like 3.40, like 3.50.
[01:36.47]So between 3 and 4 p.m.
[01:38.23]has averaged out somehow to like 3.45.
[01:40.33]Like 3.40 and 3.50.
[01:41.01]Well, that's the design.
[01:50.80]That's what it's there for.
[01:55.94]Just make it 3.30 to 4.30.
[01:58.44]No, because, no, no, I can't do that because, look, the whole point of this whole thing was to make sure that I didn't start after 4.
[02:08.59]You know what I mean?
[02:09.11]Because, like, if I got a 3 to 4 hour window, like, what, are you kidding me?
[02:12.81]Making it 3.30 to 4.30 is then like, oh, I got until 4.30 now.
[02:17.94]No, no, no, no, no.
[02:18.78]It's to make sure that I, like, get fucking ready and get here between 3 and 4.
[02:28.60]The more you push that window forward, the more it's like, well, 5.30?
[02:31.60]Alright, fine, I'll start at 5.22.
[02:33.48]But anyways, how you doing?
[02:44.26]Make it within a 24-hour range.
[02:48.93]Well, the idea was that I, okay, I got rid of the schedule, right?
[02:54.92]So, no, it is not like, oh, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.
[02:59.04]And that's it.
[02:59.72]We just do whatever.
[03:01.34]Getting rid of the time schedule was also part of the plan, but I didn't want to do that.
[03:06.40]So I kept it at, like, the three to four-ish sort of range.
[03:11.22]Because I don't want to just have it be, oh, yeah, he's going to be live at some point at some time.
[03:18.48]That doesn't make any sense.
[03:20.30]Why would I do that?
[03:22.78]Alright guys, I'll see you, uh, streams, uh, over for today.
[03:25.44]I'll see you guys, um, at some point, uh, at some time.
[03:31.96]You mean tomorrow?
[03:32.72]I don't know.
[03:34.20]You mean, what, you mean like this week?
[03:35.99]Yeah, oh, yeah, I'll stream at some point this week, but at some time.
[03:39.69]It's like, it's like sitting there waiting at the telephone.
[03:44.11]Is he gonna call?
[03:47.63]Hey, can I get your number?
[03:49.49]Yeah, yeah, sure, I'll give you my number.
[03:51.94]What's your number?
[03:52.52]Thank you, thank you.
[03:54.22]What do you think you'll call?
[03:56.48]At some point, at some time.
[03:58.90]Don't do that to me!
[03:59.86]Tell me if you're gonna call me tomorrow!
[04:05.26]Anyways, let's move on.
[04:07.88]Today is gonna be Sam and Mac season 2.
[04:16.08]I'm gonna start... He's ghosting his chat.
[04:22.63]I have never done that.
[04:25.41]Actually, well, I have, maybe a few times.
[04:29.05]But we're going to do Season 2, Episode 1 of Sam & Max.
[04:37.24]Could you already tell?
[04:38.50]Will there be anything else than Sam & Max?
[04:40.68]Oh, I know.
[04:43.44]Um, no, Sam, we're just going to do probably the first two episodes of Sam & Max tonight.
[04:48.96]And then tomorrow, that's right, four days in a row.
[04:53.68]Tell him to get rid of that schedule.
[04:55.90]And I have unleashed.
[04:59.97]You see, it's the same thing.
[05:02.47]Look, look, look.
[05:02.99]Oops, I'm sorry.
[05:05.41]I know people are going to be like, I know, I know, we get it, just go.
[05:08.89]But listen.
[05:10.48]Removing the schedule, it's the same idea of having the window there, right?
[05:15.08]Or giving, like, a perfect time.
[05:17.54]Because if I have a three-day-a-week schedule, I'm only going to stream three days a week.
[05:24.12]Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.
[05:27.15]That's it.
[05:28.03]Okay, bye.
[05:28.61]I don't have to worry about anything.
[05:30.99]Just, that's it.
[05:32.77]See, now, whenever I feel like it, we can just fucking keep going.
[05:40.14]I could go three, four, five straight days, whatever.
[05:44.52]Keep talking to us.
[05:45.36]No, with no schedule you can stream less.
[05:47.10]Well, that's true, but that's not the case.
[05:49.73]Alright, if that was the case.
[05:52.11]Is he mad?
[05:52.63]No, no, no.
[05:53.09]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[05:53.93]Mad?
[05:54.79]No, no, no, no.
[05:55.51]I'm just trying to give you some more insight.
[05:57.17]Some more lore for the wiki page.
[06:01.49]Keep stalling.
[06:03.22]Alright, you think I'm stalling?
[06:04.66]It's already ready to go.
[06:05.74]Bang.
[06:06.32]Game paused.
[06:07.32]Press space.
[06:07.74]All I have to do is press space.
[06:16.60]Oh, fucking set him off.
[06:17.38]Who set him off?
[06:18.32]No, no, no.
[06:18.90]I'm just... Nobody set me off.
[06:21.08]Don't worry.
[06:23.98]See, it's right there.
[06:24.56]I can just press it.
[06:29.94]That's a screenshot.
[06:31.10]Oh, yeah?
[06:31.86]You think that's a screenshot?
[06:36.88]Is it now, huh?
[06:39.42]What you guys don't know is I animated all this in Dreams.
[06:42.93]That's not a video!
[06:45.03]Hold on, let me just tweet this.
[06:48.49]Alright, too long streamer stalling for fucking 10 minutes before we do anything.
[06:55.64]No schedule, no time frame means I stream more.
[06:58.56]That means you get more of me.
[07:00.24]I don't know if you want that or not.
[07:01.12]Maybe you don't want that.
[07:01.94]Maybe you're like, dude, we liked it when you were less.
[07:03.67]Get the fuck out of here.
[07:05.77]Dentist waiting room.
[07:10.13]Alright, here we go.
[07:16.86]Season one, uh, season two, sorry, of Sam & Max.
[07:21.50]But I didn't even get a chance to ask you guys, how has your day been going?
[07:25.69]That's the ultimate stall question.
[07:32.99]Because I'm, okay, I'm typing right now a tweet saying that I'm live.
[07:41.54]Hey, so by the way, how has your day been?
[07:44.70]Let's go ahead, give me some answers here.
[07:50.12]Alright, season two.
[07:58.32]Alright, now it's official.
[08:02.43]I gotta go.
[08:08.29]Season two, episode one, Salmonbacks.
[08:11.19]Let's see what the intro is doing for us today.
[08:15.92]Congratulations on another successful peace summit, Mr. President.
[08:18.99]Don't congratulate me.
[08:20.47]Congratulate the peacemaker.
[08:23.17]You crack me up a little.
[08:24.29]Brain salad and a blanket, Mr. Spatula.
[08:27.29]He's been acting surly and withdrawn lately, even for a vice president.
[08:31.07]But I never thought it would come to this.
[08:33.91]His lust for power has twisted him into a mockery of the goldfish we once kind of loved.
[08:38.90]That insouciant fin-flapping.
[08:40.84]That glassy, malevolent stare.
[08:43.06]Like a sociopath or a fox newscaster.
[08:46.32]Mr. Spatula has become pure evil.
[08:49.36]Why?
[08:49.58]What'd he do?
[08:50.07]Staging a coup, Spatula?
[08:52.29]Not on my watch!
[08:54.47]Eliminate him.
[08:58.67]You are my idol!
[09:01.69]I didn't.
[09:02.03]Why did they do that?
[09:04.11]Flint Paper!
[09:05.53]Hiya, fellas!
[09:06.69]Hey, what's the rumpus?
[09:07.89]I'm in the middle of some sensitive P.I.
[09:09.55]business.
[09:10.25]And we respect your sensitivity.
[09:12.25]Is that mechanical goon one of yours?
[09:16.31]Secret sideburns of Isaac Asimov!
[09:18.13]My Maintron, my ba- That's too Maintron.
[09:28.05]That's what Mr. Spatula gets for sending a hitman with lousy aim.
[09:31.65]Max, what say we go down and administer a freelance police-style beatdown to that metal monstrosity?
[09:36.38]And then dance on its smoking carcass!
[09:38.98]It's that attention to detail that makes me glad you're still president, little buddy.
[09:50.08]Sorry, I had to... I had to... I had to talk to somebody real quick.
[09:55.65]Alright, so.
[09:57.13]First of all, this is important.
[10:00.02]I need to make sure this is in the right settings.
[10:01.92]Are these right?
[10:03.00]Wait, is Cox coming back?
[10:06.18]I hope not.
[10:08.92]I think this is fine.
[10:13.33]I had to do this because I couldn't do full screen.
[10:17.09]Because full screen wasn't going to work.
[10:20.79]Subtitles are on.
[10:21.75]Hint level.
[10:22.62]They added this in Season 2.
[10:26.95]I can't turn this on, right?
[10:27.87]People would make fun of me.
[10:28.61]I think we're good.
[10:30.24]Alright, let's go see what this thing's doing.
[10:34.98]He's tearing apart the entire building!
[10:37.12]That's fucking kind of loud, though.
[10:39.36]Hold on.
[10:39.86]That's... Give me this thing.
[10:46.41]I'm not dropping frames, right?
[10:47.81]We better not be.
[10:48.51]Alright!
[10:51.03]What do you say?
[10:53.60]Hello?
[10:57.24]We didn't see you at all last year, Flint.
[10:59.44]What gives?
[11:00.50]Okay, that was weird.
[11:01.64]I had one hell of a crazy case, fellas.
[11:04.58]Boiling a conspiracy in the movie biz, matching wits with a reanimated Grover Cleveland, breaking up Ascension's cell phone network, and a showdown with a cult leader on Saturn's largest moon!
[11:15.79]It's Wall Dad.
[11:18.01]Wow!
[11:18.99]How come we never get to do cool stuff like that?
[11:22.99]That really is Wall Dad.
[11:26.66]Alright, so, I don't have... What do I have?
[11:28.12]Gun?
[11:28.64]Shoot robot with gun.
[11:30.54]Not even a dead.
[11:31.88]They just don't make bullets like they used to.
[11:33.90]Wall dead.
[11:37.72]He's tearing apart the entire building!
[11:40.89]He's tearing apart the entire building!
[11:52.39]I'm worried, Max.
[11:53.65]Worried that enormous black mole on your back might be malignant?
[11:56.71]Well, I am now.
[11:58.12]I was just worried that the giant robot was going to tear down our building.
[12:01.50]Can you hear me?
[12:05.08]Okay.
[12:06.80]I think the button's fucked up.
[12:09.32]How are things going with your presidency?
[12:11.20]The winds of progress are blowing swift and juicy, Sam.
[12:14.75]I'm proudest of the new law I just pushed through Congress.
[12:18.19]Pretty sure he who smelt it dealt it was already established during the Eisenhower administration, little pal.
[12:25.23]Alright, let's go.
[12:26.07]I enjoy our little chats.
[12:27.53]Anything for a friend and registered voter.
[12:29.63]I'm excited for season fucking two.
[12:30.84]What's this?
[12:33.86]We should just accept we'll never teach that chick to be an arts grandmaster.
[12:38.20]How do I stop a robot from punching me?
[12:40.00]Banana peels are a lot better than what he used to fling at it.
[12:44.80]Alright, this is really loud.
[12:47.86]Like, too loud for comfort.
[12:50.04]And we can't do anything out here.
[12:50.88]He's tearing apart the... Should we leave?
[12:52.55]Should we just leave?
[13:02.41]What goes up must come down.
[13:05.22]Why you fools making all that damn... The boss goes back.
[13:08.10]Just to tell you once again who's back.
[13:11.30]Holy... What am I now?
[13:14.20]I'm going to tear your playhouse down...
[13:17.36]Sybil's dead.
[13:18.00]No, they wouldn't kill a main character like that.
[13:19.72]I don't believe it for a second.
[13:20.90]Alright, so he's... What do you want?
[13:49.65]I exist only as a mechanized engine for destruction.
[13:53.56]What I do is what I am, whether I care for it or not.
[13:57.34]Oh, no, Sam.
[13:58.32]He's been to community college.
[14:00.46]It's trouble, alright.
[14:01.46]Alright, so... We're not... I have a question.
[14:07.27]You seem like a smart guy.
[14:08.67]For a robot.
[14:10.35]Can you explain something to us?
[14:12.28]There is no question you could have that I could not answer immediately.
[14:16.48]Shoot.
[14:17.06]Okay.
[14:18.12]No, no, no, no.
[14:19.24]Put that away.
[14:21.04]Max, you're always screwing things up.
[14:22.99]God, I love him.
[14:24.79]Why are you doing this?
[14:25.63]What if all this is an illusion?
[14:26.73]Why do fools fall in love?
[14:28.85]He's having love... He's saying stuff about love.
[14:31.21]Let's ask him that question.
[14:31.95]Why do fools fall in love?
[14:34.25]Why do birds sing so gay and lovers await the breakup day?
[14:39.51]Alright, well that stopped him from doing... That stopped him from attacking the building.
[14:44.44]I wonder what that means now.
[14:45.44]Maybe we come back and we... Throw a grenade at him?
[14:49.06]I don't know.
[14:50.92]We're gonna go to Bosco's and he's selling... A... Limb tear-off device and it turns out it's a grenade.
[14:58.71]The car's fucked up.
[14:59.47]Okay.
[15:00.65]So that stops him.
[15:10.72]I don't think I can do anything else.
[15:11.66]He didn't go high enough.
[15:12.98]He should have went... Alright, let's do it again.
[15:15.72]I have a question.
[15:27.63]Why do birds appear every time you're near?
[15:30.39]What if all this is an illusion?
[15:31.67]Why do birds appear every time you're near?
[15:34.23]Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near?
[15:37.08]Alright, so he... You get him to start thinking, and then... Wait, hold on.
[15:55.70]The robot sounds like Kylo Ren.
[15:58.04]Ah, I see we gotta turn him off.
[15:59.56]Reach out the window and turn off his thing.
[16:02.60]Pull the key out.
[16:06.40]Oh!
[16:06.80]I didn't kill him.
[16:24.55]I didn't kill him.
[16:26.05]He's alive.
[16:26.43]Check the closet.
[16:27.21]Oh, that's from season one.
[16:29.17]Here's the whack the rats.
[16:30.39]Bulletin board.
[16:30.83]Cool.
[16:31.05]He's not... He's not dead.
[16:53.76]He has a wind-up toy in his back.
[16:59.36]He cannot die.
[17:01.34]He cannot die, he cannot live.
[17:03.70]He can merely exist.
[17:08.37]And I know what you're saying.
[17:09.13]Oh, hey, Jeremy, Jeremy, what about your fucking bodies?
[17:10.85]Electrolytes, huh?
[17:11.99]That's the same exact thing as pulling the key out.
[17:13.87]No, it's not.
[17:17.63]So he's just... Who is he fighting?
[17:18.97]What's he doing in here?
[17:25.63]I'm surprised this game survived being thrown clear at the Playland and Casino explosion.
[17:30.41]Nobody's saying that.
[17:31.65]Yeah, they are.
[17:32.55]You're thinking it.
[17:40.16]I forget which... it's the arm?
[17:44.90]Okay, it's the orange one.
[17:46.22]I didn't know.
[17:46.58]I forgot.
[17:50.97]I'll get that better.
[17:51.73]Hold on.
[17:53.07]I don't lose.
[17:54.52]I don't.
[17:54.84]I never lose.
[17:55.88]Don't say that.
[17:56.42]I don't lose.
[18:14.55]I don't lose.
[18:19.25]Don't ever say that to me again.
[18:21.75]I don't ever lose.
[18:22.71]Oh, okay.
[18:25.75]Alright, let's uh, let's go check on the robot.
[18:27.53]We pressed a few buttons.
[18:29.02]Not bad, kid.
[18:48.20]I have a question, Sam.
[18:50.30]How do you like me now, Spatula?
[18:52.74]I'll ignore that question, Max.
[18:54.41]In order to say, look, holy knuckle-cracking cringles on a bullet train with a sack full of ketchup and covered cheese rolls.
[18:59.11]I wish Jerma played Joffrey in Game of Thrones.
[19:00.81]He does not say that.
[19:02.33]We were wrong about Mr. Spatula all along.
[19:05.11]What do you mean, we?
[19:06.15]Why?
[19:06.95]If Spitman wasn't sent by some lowly goldfish...
[19:10.75]It was sent from a bleak and desolate wasteland by the most ancient and powerful opponent we've ever faced.
[19:17.28]A hairy, bloated, pagan god.
[19:20.94]To Santa Max from Santa.
[19:22.62]Why is... Why would Santa be sending us, um... Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[19:32.81]Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[19:35.81]Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[19:39.50]I missed my cue!
[20:02.99]Hold on.
[20:03.31]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[20:04.71]I took a bite out of a sandwich.
[20:07.07]God damn it.
[20:08.19]I can't restart it.
[20:09.25]God damn, that was a perfect opportunity.
[20:12.23]I took a bite out of my sandwich.
[20:13.95]I have a sandwich over here.
[20:16.11]Hold on.
[20:31.05]I was gonna go like this.
[20:33.98]It's too late now, but just add it.
[20:37.18]Add it.
[20:37.79]Somebody add it to the end of that.
[20:38.69]I know someone's gonna fucking clip it or something, but add this.
[20:53.62]Oh, hey, look, Max.
[20:55.04]It's the soda poppers.
[20:56.52]Again.
[20:57.30]We thought you'd all gotten taken out in the Great Dakotan conflict.
[21:00.57]You must be relieved to see we made it.
[21:03.17]Right.
[21:03.99]Relieved.
[21:05.15]What are you doing here?
[21:06.45]We all got terrible presents from Santa.
[21:09.29]So we decided to come to the North Pole and return them.
[21:12.91]Better that than spending Christmas Eve with a shotgun aimed at the fire plates.
[21:17.38]Kids today have no respect for tradition, Sam.
[21:20.50]Yeah, these guys again?
[21:24.81]why don't you go inside we were on our way in when we heard some frightening noises that's the end of the cowboy bebop intro it almost sounded like I thought you guys liked that yeah I'll write it down why am I the only one who associates Christmas with the sound of gunfire best not to think about it max
[21:50.13]Yeah, we're the governor guys governors of the Dakotas So we annexed Nebraska unfortunately there was a bit of a disagreement with who Are you going to run for reelection no now we're focused on environmental issues I
[22:13.55]We've got a new respect for nature since we got kicked out of the governor's mansion.
[22:18.75]Can we stay with you guys?
[22:20.53]No.
[22:21.43]Are they?
[22:24.72]Okay.
[22:24.94]Well, what did you get from Santa?
[22:27.06]What did you get from Santa?
[22:28.38]A jar full of rhinoceros musk.
[22:30.54]Yes.
[22:31.20]Another one.
[22:32.46]I got a see-through nightie.
[22:34.18]It's beautiful, but I don't have the hips for it.
[22:37.52]I'll trade you.
[22:38.88]Why?
[22:39.30]What did you get?
[22:40.38]Tuberculosis.
[22:42.00]Ha, ha, ha.
[22:43.84]That's what I gave Sam last year!
[22:45.12]Don't do it.
[22:45.40]Don't do it.
[22:46.10]And that's why we no longer have Secret Santa at the office.
[22:50.23]Don't fucking do it.
[22:50.97]I know some of you guys don't.
[22:52.13]You dare.
[22:52.45]Okay.
[22:55.99]We should be going.
[22:57.05]Christmas isn't gonna save itself.
[22:58.85]Yeah, not like that snobby, self-sufficient St.
[23:02.16]Patrick's Day.
[23:07.86]Alright, so we gotta go Santa's Workshop, the second happiest place on Earth.
[23:12.02]The first happiest place on Earth is Disney World.
[23:18.46]I should make a snowman on stream.
[23:23.75]I can't do that.
[23:24.97]I live in the desert.
[23:26.53]Oh, I forgot I don't live in Massachusetts anymore.
[23:33.97]Can't do that, never mind.
[23:38.53]Wait, what's this?
[23:38.95]Yellow snow reclamation.
[23:44.69]Just make a sandman.
[23:45.95]I wouldn't do that.
[23:46.41]Okay, I have a snowball.
[23:47.19]This is a pea snowball?
[23:48.98]I throw it... I throw this in his face?
[24:05.46]Yeah, we're gonna kill you.
[24:07.74]Alright, let me tell you something.
[24:08.90]That sucked.
[24:10.74]You ever been hit in the face by a snowball before?
[24:13.57]It's not fun.
[24:35.78]It really, really fucking hurts.
[24:43.91]And it's like this equal parts numb, pain, cold.
[24:47.45]It goes down your neck, into your shirt.
[24:49.69]It's awful.
[24:50.23]Alright, well I have a... I have a snowball here.
[25:00.02]And it really depends on the snow, too.
[25:02.44]You can get packed up, really, really wet snow, and it's like getting punched in the face.
[25:08.34]By a fist.
[25:09.02]People don't realize that shit.
[25:11.50]Whoa!
[25:11.66]The snow will turn red with the blood of the...
[25:30.23]The cartoons always made him seem a lot more jolly.
[25:36.97]If you have wet snow and you pack it up and throw a snowball at somebody, you are throwing a baseball at them.
[25:42.25]And then it's like, it's all fun and games.
[25:44.84]Would you throw a baseball at your friend's face as hard as you can?
[25:48.10]Why would you do that with a snowball?
[25:50.62]It's not, it's fake!
[25:51.64]It's made out of, like, fluffy water!
[25:53.80]No, no, no, it's a baseball you're throwing at your friend's head.
[25:58.78]The evidence melts away.
[25:59.86]Whoa.
[26:00.00]I would... I would track that guy.
[26:19.58]Okay, uh, see anything unusual?
[26:22.08]That doesn't even look like me.
[26:24.34]Give me a break.
[26:25.10]My teeth are way better.
[26:26.38]Y'all know that.
[26:42.94]Alright, so unspeakable evil.
[26:44.20]Can't you tell us anything about that unspeakable evil?
[26:48.23]No.
[26:49.03]Don't you know what unspeakable means?
[26:51.53]Okay.
[26:54.25]What is he doing?
[26:56.72]Beats me.
[26:57.70]I'm the intern.
[26:58.74]I just came off the assembly line yesterday.
[27:01.23]He's obsessed with teeth.
[27:03.37]Who did the dentist, like, last week?
[27:04.97]Sorry, it's relevant at the moment.
[27:06.79]Okay.
[27:24.22]So, the snowball melts.
[27:27.20]Should I throw a snowball in the elf's face?
[27:29.72]Or should I compact up a baseball snowball, throw it into the window, and hit Santa right in the mouth?
[27:38.13]Okay, we got a lot of things to look at here.
[27:39.35]Hold on.
[27:42.67]Trampoline.
[27:43.13]Max, get on the trampoline.
[27:44.03]Alright.
[27:52.20]We've got better things to do than jump around on a trampoline.
[27:56.53]Okay, so a gift dispenser.
[27:59.25]This tube spits out presents.
[28:01.41]Hey, it's just like me.
[28:02.73]I wouldn't call those presents, Max.
[28:04.81]It's a high score.
[28:05.73]You can put it with a high score.
[28:08.01]This must be what Santa uses to send presents.
[28:12.62]Cougar in a box.
[28:13.96]Footbath and piranha aquarium.
[28:17.98]That's what he sent to us.
[28:19.42]Grandma's happy pills.
[28:22.03]My first Moai head.
[28:26.85]Santa exclusive Obsess-o-matic stopwatch.
[28:35.44]Uh... Footbath and Piranha Aquarium.
[28:38.38]Just scoop them out.
[28:38.96]Oh.
[28:39.10]Attach a gift tag?
[28:47.35]I gotta find out what they want from Santa on this.
[28:49.03]Perfect!
[28:50.59]I've had a hard time lately getting people to open packages that say From Max on them.
[28:55.40]So who should this go to?
[28:56.04]You don't have yourself to blame for that.
[28:57.78]It was worth it.
[29:18.48]Okay, I just wanted to take a bite of the sandwich, but I just realized that sounded like somebody came up behind me.
[29:23.03]And like, put like a fucking, covered my mouth and like dragged me away.
[29:27.41]And I'm gone.
[29:32.91]Okay, we got the gift tags.
[29:42.22]So should, let me see, hold on.
[29:43.50]Who's it for?
[29:45.89]No one.
[29:46.97]It's for me.
[29:50.29]Oops.
[29:54.23]Alright, so I have gift tags.
[29:59.33]I can put them on the presents.
[30:00.57]What does the switch do?
[30:06.62]That turns... Alright, so hold on.
[30:10.12]Let's stop it right here.
[30:12.68]And then Max jump on the trampoline and get the coin, the star, whatever it is.
[30:17.82]Go for it, Max.
[30:22.30]Get it!
[30:26.44]What the hell?
[30:28.64]It's a toy bomber.
[30:29.86]Or a real bomber that just takes tiny warheads.
[30:33.06]Makes me wish we still had that box of tiny warheads.
[30:36.00]Not me!
[30:36.66]That was our best fishing trip ever!
[30:40.77]Alright, well, slimy crate.
[30:42.41]What is this gelatinous goo?
[30:44.13]I don't know, but for once, I don't find myself wanting to eat it.
[30:48.05]There's a mailing label.
[30:49.25]To Santa from Lower Manitoba.
[30:52.61]And they said Santa never gets gifts.
[30:57.15]Okay.
[30:57.41]Uh, should you get chicken tenders?
[31:00.57]Absolutely, get them.
[31:03.52]I wonder why they call this the Flounder Pounder.
[31:09.94]Because you can shoot tennis balls out.
[31:13.58]Don't get tenders.
[31:14.52]Why not?
[31:14.88]That's fine.
[31:16.41]Just don't.
[31:16.93]Just get chicken tenders and get, like, honey mustard sauce.
[31:19.59]I don't know.
[31:20.73]The bot buddy pre-adolescent aggression management system.
[31:23.95]Jerma would never say to get tenders.
[31:25.95]Somebody just said, should I get tenders?
[31:27.53]And I'm like, yeah!
[31:33.41]It's the world's simplest maze.
[31:35.29]What's the big deal?
[31:36.77]All mazes are simple.
[31:38.33]Not everybody has your knack for lateral thinking and heavy ordnance, Max.
[31:42.03]This is not fake.
[31:45.64]Why would you say something like that?
[31:48.70]Am I not real enough for you?
[31:50.56]I will try harder.
[31:53.76]It's Tendies, right?
[32:05.03]Okay, World's Simplest Maze.
[32:14.90]So, let me go talk to Santa.
[32:16.12]Will he shoot at me?
[32:24.60]Black sugar in water.
[32:27.76]More.
[32:29.80]More.
[32:31.82]More.
[32:37.65]Alright, come on.
[32:38.35]Give me some in- give me some Intel, Santa.
[32:40.77]I want Intel.
[32:41.61]Should I give him the kitty litter box?
[32:45.55]Alright, record player.
[32:53.00]Didn't look at it.
[32:53.90]Hmm.
[33:08.73]Wait, hold on.
[33:10.25]Double-click to run.
[33:11.11]That doesn't work.
[33:15.95]He just walks a little faster.
[33:17.07]Alright.
[33:17.35]Cannon!
[33:17.85]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[33:18.37]We're gonna have to do, like, a Rube Goldberg machine here.
[33:19.99]Hmm.
[33:33.72]Okay.
[33:34.88]So... What about the other elf?
[33:36.82]R1 to run.
[33:37.08]That's the Soda Popper.
[33:53.58]No.
[33:53.66]No more songs.
[33:54.00]No more Christmas songs.
[33:55.12]What's it like being here?
[33:56.42]Okay.
[34:23.19]Merry Christmas.
[34:24.43]Don't remind me.
[34:25.31]If we don't deal with Santa soon, we'll never make our shipping date.
[34:30.19]What about Boxing Betty?
[34:31.93]It's a Boxing Betty doll.
[34:33.81]The finest in remote control fisticuffs.
[34:36.33]Didn't the Mame-tron teach us anything about the dangers of playing with violent robots?
[34:41.53]No, I didn't learn anything.
[34:43.31]Good.
[34:44.03]I worry sometimes.
[34:46.17]Okay, well, I have Boxing Betty.
[34:48.13]Boxing Betty, simple maze, gift tags, gun.
[34:54.58]It just wouldn't feel like Christmas without the needless destruction of an innocent bystander.
[35:01.39]Can I put, like, Boxing Betty on the trampoline and launch Boxing Betty up into the atmosphere?
[35:09.31]I wonder what the elves have on their office computer.
[35:16.59]Oh, let's read their email.
[35:18.33]It's a high score list for Miresweeper.
[35:20.57]Let's see.
[35:21.53]Prancer, Wiggles.
[35:23.27]Shambling corporate presence?
[35:25.07]How'd that get there?
[35:26.43]Well, pretty soon it's going to be all max.
[35:28.91]Now, how do I start a new game?
[35:30.74]Sorry, I think it's frozen.
[35:32.72]Torture?
[35:33.60]What does it say?
[35:35.70]Hold on, what does it say?
[35:36.52]I need to see it.
[35:39.78]There's a torture thing over here.
[35:44.01]Torture Me Elmer product testing.
[35:48.97]It's a Torture Me Elmer doll.
[35:50.89]Look, he comes with his own breakable spirit and detachable retinas.
[35:57.76]What the fuck?
[36:02.46]Seeing all these toys kind of makes me wish I was a kid again.
[36:06.04]If it's any consolation, I still think of you as a child.
[36:09.26]Thanks.
[36:10.06]I wish the courts did.
[36:36.45]No, you can only do that for three seconds before people start to leave.
[36:38.89]Alright, we got, uh... Hi, guys.
[36:44.29]Let me check.
[36:44.63]Wait, wait, wait.
[36:45.37]See you later, guys.
[36:54.41]Did we... Did we do this to him?
[36:59.48]It's a topiary planted in a tiny clay pot.
[37:06.54]You guys... You guys are the... I think you guys might be the villains here.
[37:11.02]This must be Santa's sleigh.
[37:13.12]Where does he attach the flying reindeer?
[37:15.40]There's a boiler on the back.
[37:16.94]Whoa, tough break for the reindeer.
[37:22.29]Wait.
[37:22.59]Before you don't leave yet, let me see what this sounds like.
[37:25.65]Thanks.
[37:26.45]I wish the courts did.
[37:31.80]Alright, that's fucked up.
[37:38.18]I'll give that to you.
[37:39.12]That's fucked up.
[37:41.50]Santa's coal-powered sleigh.
[37:46.05]Alright, sleigh.
[37:48.25]Where are the reindeer?
[37:51.39]Whoa, you actually can run!
[37:54.05]You guys weren't lying.
[37:54.75]I can snowball.
[37:55.49]Let's think about this.
[37:56.13]Snowball.
[37:56.65]Boxing Betty.
[37:58.47]Gift.
[37:59.49]Tags.
[38:01.03]Snowball.
[38:05.30]Let's see.
[38:05.74]Snowball.
[38:07.18]Again in the head?
[38:08.62]Baseball throw into dude's face.
[38:12.33]Didn't even break.
[38:23.37]The co-op Jupiters are really good today.
[38:26.17]They tend to be.
[38:26.76]Alright, what about Santa?
[38:28.08]Throw it at Santa?
[38:36.24]It's a bot.
[38:37.36]Oh, no, no.
[38:38.08]It better not be.
[38:38.84]I don't like to hear that.
[38:43.68]Should I shoot back at Santa?
[38:51.08]I feel like there's an elaborate puzzle here that I need to be thinking of, rather than throw snowballs at people.
[38:57.36]Oh, a gun?
[39:06.48]Nope.
[39:08.52]North Pole.
[39:09.82]Okay.
[39:15.13]Alright, well, let's just leave.
[39:22.48]Use Max on the torture rack.
[39:25.04]No.
[39:26.10]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[39:27.42]Hold on.
[39:27.68]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[39:28.98]Can I actually shoot the cannon?
[39:39.64]I'm not going to do that.
[39:43.40]Whoa!
[39:43.92]Because I lined it up with the... It's not lined up anymore?
[39:50.15]It should be, right?
[39:51.05]So can I put it right in front of it?
[39:57.77]Like right here.
[39:59.47]No?
[40:00.01]I need to shoot the toy bomber.
[40:02.88]It's very obvious.
[40:07.86]No, you can only stop it here.
[40:11.62]I can't stop it anywhere else.
[40:19.17]How is it obvious?
[40:19.91]Well, I mean, I have to move it and then get it right.
[40:21.85]Okay, it doesn't work.
[40:27.86]What happened to Santa?
[40:29.24]I don't know.
[40:30.08]But if you ask me, it was only a matter of time before he snapped.
[40:34.30]He's always been a little crazy.
[40:36.38]He has?
[40:38.08]Think about it.
[40:39.12]The man gives presents away for free.
[40:42.28]I always assumed he did it for the tax write-off.
[40:50.82]That's a good humor right there.
[40:52.36]Who manufactures the toys now?
[40:54.06]It's all been moved off-site, so officially speaking, I have no idea.
[40:58.86]What about unofficially?
[41:00.40]Baby penguins.
[41:03.51]Santa paid more in taxes in 2018 than Amazon.
[41:05.09]I mean, think about that.
[41:05.99]That is a funny joke.
[41:07.13]Santa is operating at such a massive loss.
[41:22.44]Oh, the elves make the toys, but Santa, but he gotta have payroll.
[41:27.46]And he's gotta give toys to literally everybody on Earth.
[41:29.95]That's the thing.
[41:31.55]That's the lore, right?
[41:33.39]You just wake up and there's a bunch of fucking shit, expensive stuff under your tree.
[41:38.31]To millions and millions of families.
[41:41.21]Santa is operating at like a 40 to 50 billion dollar loss every year.
[41:46.47]I don't know, where's he getting the money?
[41:48.15]Who is, like, leveraging and insuring Santa Claus?
[41:56.41]He might not even be real.
[41:57.31]I mean, I don't know where the presents come from.
[42:00.09]I just assumed that they just... They just were kind of... He did it.
[42:04.01]I don't know.
[42:04.62]He might not be real.
[42:05.78]That's kind of weird to think about.
[42:10.36]Wait, if it's like 50 to 100 billion dollars a year and nobody pays it... But what about the guy that's at the mall?
[42:18.67]There's a person... There's a guy... I guess you could just... You could dress up as that guy.
[42:24.79]But they say it's him.
[42:27.21]Could be an actor.
[42:31.01]Oh.
[42:32.24]Merry Christmas.
[42:33.40]If you say so.
[42:34.20]The fuck?
[42:38.70]No, but then how... Then where did I get my stuff?
[42:42.72]When I was like... My parents might have done it.
[42:52.22]I gotta take a... I gotta take a quick break.
[42:58.31]After this, I'm just going to make a couple of phone calls.
[43:06.97]Where to, Sam?
[43:08.35]On second thought, let's just stay here.
[43:10.17]My whole world is kind of crumbling on me right now, trying to figure out what the fuck is going on here.
[43:16.29]I can't leave.
[43:19.99]Where to, Sam?
[43:21.21]On second thought, let's just stay here.
[43:22.93]Let's stay here.
[43:23.55]OK, well, I have to figure this out.
[43:26.70]Simplest maze.
[43:27.44]Max, come here.
[43:28.46]Can you do this?
[43:29.92]When one of the soda poppers touches this?
[43:33.76]Give me a snowball.
[43:37.60]Let's try throwing snowballs and stuff.
[43:43.40]I didn't do shit.
[43:44.38]Stop saying that.
[43:45.06]Throw a snowball at me.
[43:59.21]Baby penguins do good work?
[44:01.13]Sure, if you don't mind toys that have a slightly fishy smell.
[44:04.93]Giving them or receiving them?
[44:06.86]You can use the gift tube over there and see for yourself.
[44:09.92]Gift tube.
[44:10.36]We already clicked on it.
[44:11.36]Okay.
[44:12.26]We want to talk to Santa.
[44:14.34]I don't think talking is going to do any good.
[44:17.84]All he wants to do is shoot everything.
[44:20.76]That's understandable.
[44:22.04]You gotta get his gun away from him or he's gonna make us do bad things.
[44:27.09]Get the gun away.
[44:27.81]Merry Christmas.
[44:28.97]Yep.
[44:29.17]Alright, what about you?
[44:32.50]You have anything else to say?
[44:33.44]What are you doing?
[44:35.68]So we gotta make him cry.
[44:37.04]So throw a snowball at his face.
[44:57.84]Okay.
[44:57.96]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[44:58.54]We killed your dog, I'll feed you to a polar bear, I'll rip your eyes out.
[45:18.58]You were adopted.
[45:19.34]Santa isn't real.
[45:20.42]You're fired.
[45:21.26]I give up.
[45:21.94]Alright, hold on.
[45:23.24]Should we drop this absolute bombshell on him?
[45:26.31]You don't still believe in Santa Claus, do you?
[45:28.41]Sure I do.
[45:29.31]I saw him this morning.
[45:30.79]Well, I hate to be the one to break it to you, but Santa isn't real.
[45:34.87]He's just make-believe.
[45:36.67]Like the Black Easter Bunny.
[45:38.21]Or elves.
[45:39.40]But I'm an elf.
[45:41.08]That's what makes this so hard.
[45:42.95]Wait a second, are you saying I don't exist?
[45:45.69]I got him.
[45:46.14]Do you want proof that you exist?
[45:47.72]Well, sure.
[45:48.38]Got him.
[45:49.20]I mean, no, I guess I can't.
[45:53.26]Got him.
[45:53.88]Ouch, tough break.
[45:59.93]Surprise, we were lying.
[46:02.33]Congratulations, you exist.
[46:04.49]Nice try, but I don't believe in you either.
[46:06.97]Grow?
[46:13.16]Excellent.
[46:15.64]Alright.
[46:18.84]So now it's bigger.
[46:19.46]So now... Uh... Is this gonna bump into the tree?
[46:33.23]No!
[46:33.87]I thought it could, like, stop at a bump into one or something.
[46:36.21]I don't know, dude.
[46:37.48]Um, alright.
[46:38.16]Cannon.
[46:39.24]But... Hold on.
[46:45.05]There's a demon at the top of the tree.
[46:46.47]Yeah, there is.
[46:47.07]Alright, so we can throw snowball at... Give me this.
[47:07.16]It's mine now.
[47:10.36]He shat the line, little buddy.
[47:12.04]Alright, let's throw Snowball at Cannon.
[47:13.82]No.
[47:13.96]Snowball... He's already cried.
[47:15.07]There's this thing.
[47:16.25]Snowball... into... this thing.
[47:17.17]Okay.
[47:40.52]Snowball?
[47:45.07]No.
[47:46.59]Can I make something else grow?
[47:49.55]Can I make the trampoline grow?
[47:53.08]Maybe a bigger trampoline?
[47:59.98]Why not?
[48:01.16]Wait, do I have any other stuff in my office or something?
[48:03.40]Can I leave now?
[48:12.30]There is something out here.
[48:18.84]I remember this thing.
[48:19.82]Alright, so that's huge.
[48:20.82]Only on plants.
[48:21.75]Giant... topiary.
[48:22.23]I know it's called a topiary.
[48:46.40]So now we're in Santa's room.
[48:55.10]Merry Christmas.
[48:56.58]We come bearing good cheer and high-powered pistols.
[49:05.63]Santa, you okay in there?
[49:07.51]Wait, why are we coming down again?
[49:19.08]Okay, so we have to be quiet.
[49:21.48]Now, let's see here.
[49:22.62]We've got boxing Betty.
[49:24.78]Simple maze.
[49:26.92]That says aggro zone.
[49:28.02]Santa's safe.
[49:29.57]Bookshelf photo.
[49:31.77]Exit.
[49:33.57]Santa's hat.
[49:34.09]Take it.
[49:36.85]Shoot him.
[49:37.33]I'm not gonna shoot him.
[49:38.63]That's not the solution.
[49:49.68]Okay, we're good.
[49:51.43]Grr?
[49:53.01]Alright, I'm gonna shoot him now.
[49:54.75]That was my one shot.
[49:55.99]That was my one chance.
[50:00.13]But don't miss.
[50:00.49]Problem solved.
[50:20.07]Boxing Betty.
[50:20.81]Alright.
[50:21.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[50:22.89]Christmas record.
[50:24.21]Record player.
[50:25.61]Oh, it includes the smash hit, the Friendly Demon song.
[50:29.93]I can't think of anything to say right now.
[50:31.57]He'll come up.
[50:32.03]Okay, so record player, Parchment.
[50:36.57]Wicked!
[50:36.95]I want to do it now!
[50:42.77]We don't know anyone who's possessed.
[50:45.63]Or do we?
[50:46.91]Possessed.
[50:47.45]How do we start?
[50:48.59]Hey, kids, want to silence those inner voices?
[50:51.47]Do I?
[50:52.55]No more messy arcane rituals.
[50:54.89]The My Little Demon playset makes it easy.
[50:57.43]First, signal the emergence of the demon with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse action figures, sold separately.
[51:05.86]Ask your parents to help you place the horsemen around a powerful magnetic pole.
[51:10.43]Roman Polanski?
[51:11.89]Finally, draw the Hellspawn out by singing the friendly demon song using personal information about your demon.
[51:18.80]He won't be able to resist.
[51:20.64]Okay, so we need four horsemen.
[51:22.90]We need the four horsemen.
[51:29.43]Where am I gonna get the four horsemen?
[51:31.49]Performance reviews for young children.
[51:38.72]Well, at least I have the record.
[51:40.76]It's either a trip to the zoo or Santa's gotten remarried.
[51:43.86]Either way, I can't tell what he sees in her.
[51:46.80]Yeah, I think you'd need a wider lens.
[51:49.32]Alright.
[51:51.06]Well, can I put on the coat?
[51:52.62]I can't touch any of this stuff.
[51:53.61]I've never seen Santa take his coat off before.
[51:55.95]Now that you mention it, I don't think I've ever seen you take your coat off either.
[52:00.13]I haven't.
[52:02.65]Wait, this is one of the reindeers?
[52:03.73]I'm pretty sure it's either Dasher or Dancer.
[52:08.28]Well, let's just see what we can do now.
[52:11.22]We have a way to get in.
[52:15.94]So I'm gonna assume we can eventually here.
[52:18.50]I got the record.
[52:20.54]And exorcism instructions.
[52:29.37]Can I play the record?
[52:38.05]There's a whole lot of random stuff in here that I feel like I'm missing.
[52:46.46]Naruto?
[52:47.04]Why are you guys saying Naruto?
[52:51.06]Okay.
[53:08.13]What?
[53:08.75]What?
[53:09.71]It's very scary, demon.
[53:12.68]We've had it.
[53:15.00]Like two ferrets and a dolphin stapled together.
[53:18.02]He was the most unholy creature that was ever born.
[53:28.88]Herbal.
[53:29.08]Herbal.
[53:29.46]Herbal.
[53:29.66]Herbal.
[53:29.84]In the back, Zelda 94, Honda Civic.
[53:31.12]Even the other demon was scared to let him join their gang.
[53:39.25]So we have to- alright.
[53:40.05]We have, uh...
[54:11.85]Who's out here?
[54:15.33]Who's number one?
[54:15.91]Prancer.
[54:16.43]Okay.
[54:16.55]Prancer.
[54:16.73]So these are all references to stuff in... Okay.
[54:19.67]Alright.
[54:19.91]So, let me look at that again.
[54:40.71]Oh, play it.
[54:42.95]Let me just see what those options were again.
[54:55.28]Very scary form.
[55:02.28]An IRS 1040?
[55:03.84]I mean, that's... Didn't they make an IRS gelatinous goo?
[55:11.68]Because that's what's in the box.
[55:14.92]I'm going to say this one.
[55:20.58]Most unholy creature that was ever born.
[55:24.17]Okay, Manitoba.
[55:27.35]What's on the box?
[55:36.45]Like Minesweeper, right?
[55:37.96]That's Minesweeper.
[55:43.16]Shout his name.
[55:44.14]Prancer.
[55:48.65]Oh, shit.
[55:52.25]That's not- the corporate presence didn't win.
[55:58.98]Is it that?
[55:59.80]That's- no, no, no.
[56:00.48]That's the only thing- that's the only possible option.
[56:01.98]Oh!
[56:02.14]Huh.
[56:08.00]The song seemed right.
[56:09.50]I guess we must not have all the horsemen in place yet.
[56:11.56]Oh, fuck.
[56:12.04]I have to have to put them over here.
[56:13.18]I have to have four horsemen.
[56:15.30]Hey, it's the North Pole.
[56:16.68]The magnetic center of the Earth.
[56:19.53]Magnetism?
[56:21.03]Don't tell me you're one of those kooks.
[56:23.41]You don't believe in magnetism?
[56:25.41]It's an interesting theory, but I'm not convinced.
[56:28.45]Your magnetism is a cute bedtime story, but I believe in one thing.
[56:37.57]I can't believe this works.
[56:42.89]Max is a flat earther.
[56:45.61]Alright.
[56:46.09]So we need four people, or four things, out here.
[56:51.26]How do I... Where the hell does that come into play?
[56:55.86]Is it the soda poppers?
[56:56.74]It's only three.
[57:00.20]Who's the fourth?
[57:06.69]Is it Max?
[57:08.14]Hi, guys.
[57:10.44]Why don't you go inside?
[57:11.92]We're waiting for the shootout to end.
[57:14.25]I can respect that.
[57:15.43]How?
[57:18.13]So, I have to stop Santa from doing that.
[57:19.95]See you later, guys.
[57:20.47]So they go inside, so I can teleport them to help.
[57:24.29]Alright.
[57:24.57]Maybe something with the gifts.
[57:33.37]No, but I'll have it.
[57:34.13]Can I leave yet?
[57:39.14]Okay, I can leave.
[57:40.76]Let's go back to the office.
[57:41.56]Drive from here to there.
[57:42.56]Because I couldn't leave before.
[57:44.02]This is the first time I've been able to come back to the town.
[58:03.94]Alright, well, hold on.
[58:04.40]Sybil's is... Is Sybil alive in here?
[58:06.88]Sybil's not here.
[58:07.94]It's closed.
[58:08.60]Oh.
[58:09.02]Oh, poor Sybil.
[58:09.76]Sorry, Sybil.
[58:10.40]We tried.
[58:10.72]Alright, boss goes for the first time.
[58:12.84]Who's this rat?
[58:13.52]That's not a clickable rat.
[58:30.19]New S&M season.
[58:31.61]It's a shame you don't wear collars, Sam.
[58:33.95]It says they're coming back in style.
[58:36.65]Canada sells U.S.
[58:38.29]to Macro Heart Corporation.
[58:40.37]I wondered why the stock market kept crashing.
[58:44.17]Alright, let's go in.
[58:44.81]How's Bosco doing in season two?
[58:52.20]Welcome to Bosco's inconvenience.
[58:56.57]Wait while I determine whether you are truly welcome or if I am just uttering idle pleasantries.
[59:02.47]Nothing says inconvenience like a full-body search before you can buy your candy cigarettes and all-day suckers.
[59:08.36]You have been deemed not unacceptable.
[59:10.90]Welcome.
[59:13.44]Bosco, your disguise.
[59:15.32]It's... it's... it's hideous.
[59:17.76]Claw my eyes out, Sam.
[59:19.26]I can't bear to look at it.
[59:21.32]Not if I claw my own eyes out first.
[59:23.44]He's not going to be in a costume.
[59:24.56]I'm not wearing a disguise.
[59:27.06]I know, comedy.
[59:27.86]I forgot how ugly you were without a wig or hat or something.
[59:32.08]My package.
[59:36.41]Alright, so what package?
[59:39.27]Okay.
[59:56.50]keep going who would send you a bomb my mother of course she sends me one every year around this time what the families need traditions so why don't you just get rid of it I built that bomb disposal unit for that very purpose so why don't you just get rid of it because it might be the billion dollar plunger I just ordered what a dilemma
[60:20.20]billion dollars just open it just open your package Bosco what if it's the bomb I thought I heard ticket just get rid of your package Bosco forehead what if it's my plunger I gotta be sure it's ticket just open your package Bosco just get rid of your package Bosco but what just open your package Bosco just get rid of your package Bosco
[60:51.95]That's the shit I gotta deal with on a day-to-day basis.
[61:06.16]I know what it's like.
[61:08.83]Why no disguise?
[61:11.19]Sam, Sam, Sam, you poor naive fool.
[61:15.61]Don't you realize the time for disguises is past?
[61:19.50]Yeah, you poor naive fool.
[61:21.50]Don't you realize that?
[61:22.98]Quiet, head knuckle.
[61:24.20]A disguise could never protect you from T-H-E-M.
[61:28.74]Them?
[61:29.09]Them.
[61:36.08]That's exactly what I'm trying to figure out.
[61:38.60]I'm watching, I'm listening, and I will find T.E.M.
[61:43.98]Well, if you do, tell them... Okay, this is getting old fast.
[61:50.71]Them.
[61:53.81]Them.
[61:54.07]That's great.
[61:58.95]I love it.
[61:59.63]Just open your package, Bosco.
[62:01.55]Them.
[62:02.87]Them.
[62:05.23]Just get rid of your package, Bosco.
[62:11.00]Welcome to every Jerma985 stream.
[62:17.50]Just get rid of your package, Bosco.
[62:19.30]Oh, shit!
[62:19.60]I...
[62:37.07]I don't do that, though.
[62:38.23]I don't do that.
[62:39.39]I can't do that.
[62:43.41]What's with your store?
[62:45.08]I'm not sure if you noticed, but this ain't a store no more, man.
[62:47.60]Your jokes do always go wrong.
[62:50.34]I haven't noticed anything.
[62:51.92]Look, I've got a hundred trillion dollars and a thousand faceless enemies.
[62:56.28]I don't need to sell anything.
[62:57.68]Then why keep the place open?
[62:59.98]I'm a people person.
[63:03.10]You would if you could.
[63:03.90]No, I would not.
[63:04.80]I love you guys.
[63:05.40]You guys are great.
[63:06.46]You think I would ever do that?
[63:07.32]Okay.
[63:10.36]What's with the door scanner?
[63:13.48]Tools are necessary.
[63:15.53]Tools are the only thing to separate us from the animals.
[63:18.76]That probably plays a little better with the non-dog and rabbit ground.
[63:22.46]That's why I need the personal antipathy registration annulment and non-negational omnifunctional identification device.
[63:30.81]That's just paranoid.
[63:32.67]Technically, yes it is.
[63:35.17]Okay.
[63:35.71]Oh, here we have another one of these.
[63:37.21]Do you have any bulletproof edible underwear?
[63:39.90]I don't have anything.
[63:41.66]This ain't a store.
[63:42.98]It's not a store anymore.
[63:44.24]I'm gonna get punched.
[63:45.02]Punch.
[64:09.92]Do you have any... No!
[64:11.39]This ain't a store!
[64:13.77]It's not?
[64:14.65]No!
[64:15.89]Oh, why didn't you say so?
[64:18.01]A trillion dollars worth of detection equipment, and yet he still didn't see that one coming a mile away.
[64:27.12]Wow, I'm being a real asshole.
[64:49.33]Hold on.
[64:49.71]My regards to your decorator.
[64:51.01]I like this.
[64:51.39]Yeah, what's the style?
[64:52.61]Early colonial conspiracy theorist?
[64:54.95]No, a theorist is somebody who has a theory.
[64:58.09]I have conspiracy facts.
[65:00.35]So, I guess you'd be a conspiracy factist.
[65:03.15]He's certainly not a clueist.
[65:05.19]Conspiracy factist.
[65:07.25]Because he doesn't have a clue.
[65:10.37]Yeah, I got it.
[65:13.21]Alright.
[65:13.73]Enough about your store.
[65:15.21]It's not a... Oh, forget it.
[65:20.46]Just open your package, Bosco.
[65:23.18]See ya, Bosco.
[65:23.90]Alright, bomb be gone.
[65:29.16]Can we borrow your bomb be gone?
[65:31.17]There's some obsolete landmines around the office we need to get rid of.
[65:34.47]No!
[65:34.89]If I loaned my bomb disposal unit out to everyone in the neighborhood who needed it, I'd never get it back.
[65:40.41]You know, in this neighborhood, that's actually true.
[65:44.45]X-ray machine.
[65:45.24]So it's not a story.
[65:46.04]It really isn't.
[65:48.54]Theory of everything.
[65:52.69]Isn't that the Stephen Hawking movie?
[65:55.15]That's not the shit that he made.
[65:56.39]That's not the stuff that he researched.
[65:58.55]Alright, X-Ray Machine.
[65:59.37]Uh, X-Ray Boxing Day.
[66:17.89]Um, x-ray... What about these?
[66:21.05]To exorcise the demon, it says we'll need to collect the four horsemen of the apocalypse action figures.
[66:26.65]Place the horsemen around a magnetic pole and draw the demon out using the friendly demon stone.
[66:31.58]Alright, so we just need the four horsemen.
[66:35.64]Enlarger.
[66:36.08]Is everybody shrinking?
[66:37.44]Okay, if the tears make things grow...
[66:49.12]Does the... I'm not gonna say it.
[66:52.02]Because that's an easy, low-hanging fruit.
[66:56.56]Fill in the blank.
[66:59.75]Alright, so... I'm not... Let me go check the other stuff.
[67:10.66]Wait, this is open?
[67:13.30]Stinky's Diner is... open!
[67:17.19]Stinky's Diner.
[67:18.25]It's back in business.
[67:19.27]A new character?
[67:20.03]An excited neighborhood reopens its arms.
[67:22.55]And its emergency rooms.
[67:26.29]Stinky's Diner.
[67:28.03]I'm excited for a new character.
[67:29.69]Ah, the smell of desiccated eggs congealing bacon fat and rye bread gone awry.
[67:34.89]It's like Stinky's Diner never closed!
[67:37.92]Welcome to Stinky's.
[67:39.84]We never close, except when we're closed.
[67:43.03]Who are you?
[67:43.55]Was it Stinky?
[67:44.33]I'm Stinky.
[67:45.64]The Stinky we know was a cantankerous old man who transformed his seething hatred of humanity into a misanthropic smorgasbord of culinary horrors.
[67:54.06]That does sound like grandpa.
[67:56.26]Okay, we're ready for the next round of trivia.
[67:59.12]And the question is, when did the War of 1812 begin?
[68:00.89]A.
[68:00.93]1812.
[68:00.99]B.
[68:01.07]20,000 years B.C.
[68:01.35]C. March 3rd, 2004.
[68:01.85]D. Bangers and mash.
[68:02.43]Bangers and mash.
[68:02.77]Do I get to answer?
[68:03.17]I can't.
[68:03.35]Okay.
[68:04.05]Alpha horn.
[68:25.20]Bug.
[68:26.12]Oh, it's a bug!
[68:26.74]I got two people living in there.
[68:52.83]Why'd you play back that demon recording?
[68:54.87]I've got a case of PISD, post-insecticide stress disorder.
[68:59.54]It keeps causing these flashbacks.
[69:01.80]How so?
[69:02.72]I get a whiff of something familiar, and the memories just come rushing back.
[69:06.88]Must have been some brimstone in the air during that exorcism.
[69:10.08]Oh, was that brimstone?
[69:11.48]This whole time, I just assumed you let out a 200-pound fart.
[69:14.79]No, it was brimstone.
[69:16.19]Honest.
[69:17.59]Okay.
[69:17.69]Okay.
[69:21.39]You don't get along with your family?
[69:23.17]Negative!
[69:24.03]Except for my dad, they're all a bunch of spineless ladybugs.
[69:27.83]Alright, all but spineless?
[69:29.75]Not in my regiment.
[69:30.99]If you didn't have a spine, by God, my dad would make you grow a pair.
[69:35.01]A pair of spines?
[69:36.29]That's just the kind of bug he was.
[69:38.39]Oh, I forgot about the dream.
[69:40.13]Like, I had a dream last night that I had to tell you about.
[69:42.57]This is important, really important.
[69:43.73]We can pause this for a second.
[69:46.21]I actually can't pause this.
[69:47.81]So listen to this shit.
[69:49.09]So last night, I had a dream.
[69:50.97]And this is, it was too real.
[69:53.43]So, I had a dream.
[69:54.75]You know how people have dreams about me streaming?
[69:58.59]They say, dude, I was having this dream, you were streaming, and you got sucked up, the gray fluid went into your brain, and then I... So I was having a dream that I was streaming.
[70:09.12]And I turned on the webcam.
[70:11.26]I don't know what game I was playing.
[70:12.46]It didn't matter.
[70:12.98]But I was going to do a joke that I thought was going to be funny.
[70:16.61]And everyone was like, Oh, joke incoming!
[70:19.01]Joke incoming!
[70:19.71]Webcam's on!
[70:20.43]And I was like, I didn't have anything.
[70:21.65]I had nothing.
[70:25.07]So I was like, Oh fuck, I gotta think of something funny to do quick.
[70:27.77]Because I don't have a joke ready.
[70:29.81]And I did the turn on the webcam thing.
[70:33.07]So I just started going like this.
[70:34.13]I started punching towards the camera.
[70:36.65]And every time I would punch, I was going...
[70:39.37]I'm gonna get you guys with some karate!
[70:43.23]And it was like minus twos and people were just like... I did it like four or five times in a row.
[70:49.89]And I remember right when I stopped doing it, I was like, this was not even funny.
[70:54.62]That was not even... That was horrible.
[70:57.00]And I was like, I'm just kidding.
[70:58.28]I turned off the webcam and I was still asleep.
[71:02.28]And I went through the rest of my night...
[71:05.54]Walking around, like, eating, I just have these vague, weird flashes of me lying in my bed, being like, fuck, that, like, that really, that joke really sucked.
[71:14.05]It's alright, like, I'll come back tomorrow and, like, do something funny, and then I woke up.
[71:20.98]That was yesterday.
[71:22.48]Imagine if this actually happened.
[71:37.82]I'm so fucked up and like delirious and so scatterbrained that I don't even remember what I did yesterday And I thought it was a dream He doesn't remember it He's not even funny in his dreams
[72:08.70]No, I'm not.
[72:10.30]Here we go, let's go.
[72:13.02]I just, that makes it even funnier in my brain that like this actually happened.
[72:17.66]And I thought it was... I don't have any clothes on.
[72:25.34]I can't turn my webcam on.
[72:29.29]I was like, punch, punch, punch, like karate to you guys.
[72:34.27]And people hated it.
[72:35.71]That didn't happen yesterday.
[72:42.29]No, stop fucking with my head.
[72:44.32]No, nope.
[72:47.94]This is not like time travel, guys.
[72:49.50]I don't have to like redo the thing that I did to keep the timeline going correctly.
[72:54.26]What do you mean we have the clip?
[72:58.73]What are you linking?
[73:00.47]Hold on.
[73:09.15]No, it's not the slap.
[73:10.11]What is that?
[73:11.08]Effectator, what are you linking here?
[73:20.57]This... What is this?
[73:27.07]I missed my Q!
[73:27.79]Oh, wait, you already did this?
[73:33.98]Wait, what is this one?
[73:38.68]Wait, how did you get this already?
[73:42.30]Oh, here comes a joke!
[73:43.32]Karate!
[73:43.72]Ugh...
[73:47.86]I already hate it.
[73:49.02]Not the video, but... Hold on.
[73:59.47]I missed my Q!
[73:59.99]Hold on.
[74:01.29]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[74:02.13]I took a bite out of a sandwich.
[74:03.63]God damn it.
[74:19.73]I can't restart it.
[74:20.83]God, that was a perfect opportunity.
[74:23.05]I took a bite out of my sandwich.
[74:26.20]I have a sandwich over here.
[74:27.88]Hold on.
[74:30.38]I was gonna go like this.
[74:32.68]It's too late now, but just add it.
[74:35.87]Add it.
[74:36.45]Somebody add it to the end of that.
[74:37.37]I know someone's gonna fucking clip it or something, but add this.
[74:52.94]That was not what I did.
[74:57.20]That was not even close to what I did.
[74:59.30]Alright, let me play the game.
[75:15.47]Recreate the karate joke.
[75:18.39]No!
[75:18.75]Hold on, let me put on like a blanket.
[75:25.86]bag on my body.
[75:27.54]I need a shirt.
[75:28.60]Hair.
[75:28.96]This is fine.
[75:30.50]Will this cover enough?
[75:37.82]Yeah, this is fine.
[75:38.72]This will cover it up.
[75:41.32]This is essentially wearing a shirt.
[75:44.20]Is it?
[75:44.48]I need to look.
[75:44.90]I need to see where the camera is because this functions as a t-shirt.
[75:55.67]Yeah, we're good.
[75:56.41]Oh, we're good.
[76:14.43]Okay.
[76:21.01]Yeah, this functions as a t-shirt.
[76:22.53]Okay.
[76:23.95]So I said...
[76:27.03]Hey, it's time for some karate!
[76:30.59]That's what I did.
[76:43.93]And that's like a Spongebob thing, right?
[76:54.11]Oh no, I'm looking over and I'm seeing it.
[76:59.45]You know, here's the really fucked up part about this whole thing.
[77:04.19]I'm living right now the dream that I had last night.
[77:08.59]That's... I had to correct... There's some weird like... Time thing where I had to do that.
[77:17.37]I just probably... I just like saved... All the... All the whole universe by doing what I just did.
[77:26.90]For some reason I had to do that.
[77:35.08]I had to help, somehow.
[77:36.06]I don't know how.
[77:36.76]Is it the same armor from the day... Yes, it is.
[77:43.47]It was just in the closet, and I knew I could use it as a shirt.
[77:50.68]Sometimes you gotta think about that.
[77:51.74]Like, why did I have that dream in the first place?
[77:55.30]It was because they knew that I was going to have to do this.
[77:58.98]And that second, somebody was watching the stream and I had to stall here for a second for some reason.
[78:03.81]Because that made them pay attention for some reason.
[78:07.85]Because they're going to go on to be like a scientist.
[78:11.11]And right after fucking watching that clip, they thought of something to write down or at that moment they picked their career path.
[78:20.27]And then you go on and you, like, cure every illness.
[78:23.19]Because of just the way that the time... That had to happen for a reason.
[78:30.48]Santa isn't fucking real.
[78:31.66]Figure it out.
[78:32.08]Alright, when did you start?
[78:34.04]Where are we?
[78:34.40]How long have you had this weird flashback disorder?
[78:37.00]Ever since my company tried and failed to take Hamburger Hill.
[78:41.06]In NAMM?
[78:42.26]Negative.
[78:42.88]Hamburger Hill behind the Burger Buddies on West 5th.
[78:45.76]The place reeked of pheromones.
[78:48.61]Charlie was using Roach Motel.
[78:52.15]Roach Motel!
[78:54.69]I gotta get a good career so I'm not a guy in my 30s punching into a camera with a child's hockey chest pad on.
[79:05.48]You know, however we do it, we do it.
[79:10.98]However we do it, we do it, guys.
[79:12.97]Right?
[79:15.05]Wanna compare notes on the trivia contest?
[79:17.31]That's strictly on a need-to-know basis.
[79:19.97]We've got clearance from the department of being bigger than you and having guns.
[79:24.51]Well, what do you think it is, smart guy?
[79:30.08]It's D. We think it's D. Excellent choice, men.
[79:33.54]Proceed.
[79:34.26]Wait, what was... Oh, fuck, wait.
[79:36.10]Sir, so long, sir.
[79:37.64]Keep him dangly, dogface.
[79:39.05]Hey, you okay?
[79:39.93]Hey, you okay, man?
[79:43.50]Was it D?
[79:49.18]Yeah.
[79:50.80]D. Alright.
[79:57.72]Hey, Sybil.
[79:58.66]Oh, hey there, Sam and Max.
[80:00.96]What was all that commotion outside?
[80:03.38]Just a little urban renewal project that got out of hand.
[80:06.37]By the way, didn't you tell us that you wished your office was closer to a good restaurant?
[80:10.73]That's right.
[80:11.95]Why?
[80:12.31]No reason.
[80:13.39]Alright, what are you doing here?
[80:16.49]What brings you here?
[80:17.70]I thought it would be fun to play this trivia quiz, but instead we're stuck watching Stinky make a mockery of the word knowledge.
[80:25.06]Sounds like fun to me.
[80:26.60]Yeah, Max and I always have a blast making a mockery of the word justice.
[80:32.10]How's Stinky ruining the trivia?
[80:34.68]Why?
[80:35.17]No, I'm sure my answers are right, but Stinky says otherwise.
[80:39.90]I'm sure you're right too, dear.
[80:42.06]If this is too aggravating.
[80:44.30]Oh no, this is fine, Abe.
[80:46.80]I'm just enjoying being here with you.
[80:49.22]If I weren't trying to impress Abe, I'd call that lying witch's eyes out.
[80:55.01]She doesn't want to be here.
[80:56.35]Get her out quick.
[80:57.71]Otherwise, your entire relationship is based on a lie.
[81:01.07]Why are you giving out relationship advice, Max?
[81:03.73]I just want to see a good cat fight.
[81:07.30]Anytime somebody says on a date, no, no, no, I just like being here with you.
[81:10.86]Out.
[81:13.64]Because that means, no, I hate everything that's happening here, but I like you.
[81:27.33]So it's like, oh shit.
[81:32.51]When you're the most interesting thing,
[81:35.47]In the laser tag area?
[81:37.45]I think, yeah, come on.
[81:42.25]She probably doesn't like laser tag.
[81:47.69]And why did you pick that in the first place?
[81:50.81]You gotta go somewhere you're both gonna like.
[81:52.31]You can't just be like, oh, I like laser, let's go play laser tag.
[81:58.57]Go see a movie.
[82:02.65]Lasertag, yeah, you decided to take her to Lasertag, or take him to Lasertag, doesn't matter.
[82:14.06]And you thought it was a good idea, yeah, I love Lasertag, it's awesome, I love it, it's my favorite thing.
[82:18.94]Oh, this is cool, yeah, pick you up at 8, okay, cool.
[82:22.26]And you go there and you're moving around, you go here all the time and you fucking lighten up the scoreboard.
[82:27.27]You do so many more points than them.
[82:32.19]Why is that fun?
[82:33.49]Don't do that.
[82:36.77]He's speaking from experience.
[82:37.91]This is too specific to be a random joke.
[82:41.91]Let me help you here.
[82:46.98]By the way, I used the name Cloud9 a long time ago for my laser tag days.
[82:53.16]This is before that company even existed.
[82:56.10]I was like 12.
[83:00.41]I swear to God, this is real.
[83:14.36]Are you and Abe on a date?
[83:16.38]Well, if you want to call it that.
[83:18.46]I did that when I took a girl bowling.
[83:19.46]What if I wanted to call it the unspeakable obscenity from beyond space cackling on the threshold of utter madness?
[83:25.96]I think I'd prefer date.
[83:30.77]Wait, did you get like a bunch of strikes?
[83:33.77]And she was on her, like, phone?
[83:40.43]Okay, so let's figure out the trivia thing.
[83:49.12]Yeah, that's red flag number one.
[83:51.16]If you're having a great time and she's on her phone.
[83:57.86]Okay.
[84:30.69]Why are all these people... Two.
[84:31.63]What's the prize?
[84:50.86]If anyone wins, they get my ancient heirloom.
[84:54.66]Sickly man on a horse.
[84:56.62]Famine.
[84:56.88]Pestilence.
[84:57.16]Not that anyone's come close to winning yet.
[84:59.86]My sophisticated questions are just too esoteric for these booth monkeys.
[85:04.34]Booth monkeys?
[85:05.38]Where?
[85:06.12]It's just an expression.
[85:07.21]No, not wrath.
[85:09.45]They think of the seven horses of sins.
[85:14.75]Not the four horsemen of the apocalypse.
[85:21.16]Okay, can we play?
[85:21.95]How do you play?
[85:22.97]It's easy.
[85:24.11]Just grab a trivia pad.
[85:25.99]I'll read a question.
[85:27.25]You write down the answer.
[85:29.43]I'll review the answers.
[85:31.01]And then you'll see how much smarter I am than everyone else.
[85:35.05]You can choose a team if you want.
[85:36.83]Ooh, ooh, Sam!
[85:38.36]Pick me!
[85:38.94]Pick me!
[85:42.10]Okay.
[85:42.44]We'd like to order something.
[85:43.92]We're all out.
[85:45.46]Of what?
[85:46.52]Whatever you're going to order.
[85:47.78]That's okay.
[85:49.04]We just want to order it anyway.
[85:51.71]Alright.
[85:53.93]Daily special.
[85:55.79]Poached eggs with tin foil.
[85:56.83]Tuna sandwich with peppers and pop rocks.
[85:58.35]Ooh.
[86:00.54]We'd like the tuna sandwich, extra peppers and pop rocks on white bread.
[86:03.90]That sounds kind of cool.
[86:04.54]Sal, I need an Al Gore and mariachi pants riding a disco ball.
[86:09.74]Sweet and sour salt water.
[86:11.02]That sounds good too.
[86:11.64]We'd like the sweet and sour salt water taffy.
[86:13.68]Sal, Julia Roberts, put a bullet in her brain and kiss her with Andy Rooney.
[86:17.91]It's like my secret dreams made audible.
[86:22.10]Two yogurts and a turkey sandwich.
[86:24.52]We'll have two yogurts and an open-faced turkey sandwich.
[86:27.22]Sal, hublis times two with a side of brady culture.
[86:32.13]Uh, poached eggs with tinfoil.
[86:33.05]We'll have poached eggs with tinfoil.
[86:35.43]Sal, give me the Norse god thorn, a terrarium, and spank him.
[86:41.25]Double biscuit burger, no clams.
[86:43.30]I'd like the double burger baked in biscuit dough.
[86:45.30]Hold the clams.
[86:46.36]Half a doppelganger in tight pants, singing solo.
[86:50.61]Precious special with hash browns.
[86:51.95]Could I get the precious special with hash browns?
[86:54.59]Sal, two lemony snickets and a Mexican standoff with a prairie dog.
[86:59.59]What's the daily special?
[87:01.67]Sal, condi rice, kickboxing the Buddha, Thai style.
[87:04.73]What's in it?
[87:05.61]What do you mean, what's in it?
[87:09.17]On second thought, I'm on a diet.
[87:10.72]Alright, what was that about trivia?
[87:14.66]What's happening again?
[87:15.88]A trivia contest.
[87:17.40]Just grab a pad and try a round.
[87:19.06]Okay.
[87:20.43]So, let's go try around.
[87:21.95]But how's business, first of all?
[87:23.13]Exhaust all actions.
[87:24.03]Well, it's no Italian villa rendezvous with George Clooney.
[87:27.41]But reopening the family restaurant is very fulfilling.
[87:31.26]Bringing people closer to obesity-induced ischemic heart disease is its own reward.
[87:35.88]On the other hand, George is much easier on the eyes.
[87:39.30]And the feet.
[87:40.92]My dogs are barking louder than you, Fido.
[87:43.30]Grr.
[87:43.78]Okay.
[87:44.02]Okay.
[87:48.78]The forbidden word.
[88:16.94]So long.
[88:18.42]Alright, well, let's sit down.
[88:25.96]Let's give this trivia question a try.
[88:29.76]It's D. Okay, let's hear everyone's answers.
[88:33.24]We'll start with you, Sybil.
[88:36.00]I chose A. Of course you did, dear.
[88:39.64]Because you're wrong.
[88:40.40]I also chose A.
[88:44.75]And that's very sweet, Mr. President.
[88:47.32]But also very wrong.
[88:48.74]The answer is D. D!
[88:50.32]Wait.
[88:50.52]Oh, I'm sorry.
[88:51.06]That's not right.
[88:53.01]That is wrong.
[88:56.45]We also chose D.
[88:58.26]Really?
[88:58.90]Hilarious.
[89:01.54]And again, wrong.
[89:02.56]The correct answer was actually B. B?
[89:07.15]Liar.
[89:08.07]Alright, next question.
[89:09.95]This day of the week comes between Tuesday and Thursday.
[89:13.31]What is it?
[89:14.35]A. Doomsday.
[89:15.41]B. Wednesday.
[89:17.93]C. Doris Day.
[89:19.87]D. Menachem Begin.
[89:25.10]Doomsday.
[89:29.98]Okay, let's hear everyone's answers.
[89:31.90]I chose B. I think we have to make them choose the wrong answers.
[89:34.04]I love how you keep playing even though you're always wrong.
[89:36.66]Never lose that.
[89:39.54]I also chose B. We all have to choose the right answer.
[89:43.56]Oh, how cute.
[89:44.59]You two are like identical twins or something with your enormous foreheads and your matching wrong answers.
[89:50.53]The answer is D. D. No, it is not.
[89:54.11]Not.
[89:54.27]How could you be bad at this?
[89:56.09]What?
[89:56.86]What are you talking about?
[89:58.80]So, okay.
[90:00.01]I get it.
[90:00.79]I understand now.
[90:02.61]I know what you gotta do.
[90:04.19]Here's the plan.
[90:04.99]You gotta make everybody... Somebody has to win.
[90:06.61]None of this matters.
[90:25.02]So convince everybody to choose a different answer, and then choose the one that was not picked.
[90:31.26]So somebody has to be right.
[90:32.80]23 skidoo, Mr. Lincoln.
[90:37.66]What's shakin', Mr. Ex-President?
[90:41.66]Hmm?
[90:42.76]Oh, it's you two.
[90:43.98]I also chose D. Want to compare notes on the trivia contest?
[90:48.57]That's not necessary.
[90:50.17]Abe and I know what we're doing.
[90:52.07]That's right.
[90:52.83]We're doing fine.
[90:54.13]Help me out here, guys.
[90:57.07]We think it's A. We think it's A. Hmm.
[91:01.25]Okay.
[91:02.81]Alright.
[91:03.87]Bye.
[91:04.89]See you, AL.
[91:06.10]Represent.
[91:07.86]We think it's B. Do you know the answer to the trivia question?
[91:11.52]I'd rather not say.
[91:12.98]I'm kind of competitive.
[91:14.28]That's okay.
[91:15.02]We're not.
[91:16.00]Why?
[91:16.70]What do you think the answer is?
[91:19.04]B. We think it's B. Hmm.
[91:22.08]Good to know.
[91:23.64]Okay.
[91:24.28]See ya, Sybil.
[91:24.82]Then have you pick C. Hello, sir.
[91:28.81]Ah!
[91:29.51]Oh, I thought you were my family.
[91:31.43]They always try to surprise me on my birthday.
[91:33.01]Someone's gonna win the prize and then I just... Birthday?
[91:35.21]Who the hell is this?
[91:45.87]What the fuck is this?
[91:46.49]Okay.
[91:46.67]C. We think it's C. We have five community subs coming in.
[91:50.37]Thanks for the five community subs, Tori T.
[92:08.07]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[92:09.79]Five.
[92:10.17]Community cells.
[92:11.26]Thank you, Torti.
[92:11.86]Wait, what, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what?
[92:29.93]What?
[92:30.15]We also chose D. Oh, he chooses D. The correct answer was B. He chooses D every time.
[92:36.87]Time for a new question.
[92:38.15]Who is buried in Grant's tomb?
[92:40.03]No matter what.
[92:41.37]A. Grant.
[92:42.85]B. C. Alright, alright.
[92:44.27]It's C. D. Spam.
[92:47.07]C. We picked C. He's gonna pick D. You pick A. Let's talk trivia.
[92:54.45]Wanna compare notes on the trivia contest?
[92:56.90]Yes.
[92:57.60]Hook a brother up.
[92:59.83]He always picks D. What's the actual, wait, what's the actual fucking answer here?
[93:07.61]Hold on.
[93:24.41]Who is buried in Grant's tomb?
[93:26.03]Grant.
[93:27.37]So, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[93:28.83]She's going to answer Grant.
[93:31.25]So, Sybil is going to do Grant.
[93:33.80]So, that means we have to give Abe B, and we have to do C. Want to compare notes on the trailer contest?
[93:43.58]Yes.
[93:44.26]Hook a brother up.
[93:45.32]So, you do B. We think it's B. Thanks for the tip.
[93:50.55]See you, AL.
[93:52.53]Okay.
[93:53.23]So then we're going to do C. He's going to do D. Bingo.
[93:58.61]Problem solved.
[94:02.43]So we do C. Okay.
[94:06.05]Let's hear everyone's answers.
[94:07.71]I chose A. Of course you did, dear.
[94:10.79]Because you're wrong.
[94:13.57]I chose B. Come on.
[94:15.70]I appreciate a man unafraid to flaunt his ignorance.
[94:19.76]Wrong.
[94:20.10]You think I read chat?
[94:21.34]The answer is D. D. I look over here and I say random answers to random questions.
[94:27.21]I don't have chat open.
[94:28.41]I've never had chat open.
[94:29.73]No, that's wrong.
[94:31.20]Oh, I guess it must be right.
[94:34.12]Well, congratulations.
[94:35.80]You know, you guys always say, nobody said that.
[94:37.80]I really enjoyed that you won, but I'm far too magnanimous to let it bother me.
[94:41.06]Cheaters.
[94:42.56]It's the limited edition Pestilence maquette with super detailed open sores.
[94:47.60]Aw, see how he slumps in his saddle?
[94:49.34]Does he have any cool action features?
[94:50.92]I'm surprised I've been able to go four years of doing this without people knowing.
[94:53.88]What's the worst a toy could do?
[94:55.76]Choke a toddler?
[94:56.74]Blind a toddler?
[94:57.72]Hmm.
[94:58.82]Eviscerate?
[94:59.98]Well, it looks like nothing happened anyway.
[95:01.85]Let's go.
[95:08.48]One guy is fake.
[95:09.64]One guy is just alternate accounts.
[95:11.82]I have to find a way to reply to somebody.
[95:13.36]Alright, so we got one horseman of the apocalypse.
[95:21.43]It is... Pestilence.
[95:23.65]I knew it.
[95:24.55]I knew it.
[95:26.99]Still need to do something with... Can I do anything over here?
[95:28.95]What about down here?
[95:33.38]Whoa, wait a minute.
[95:34.59]Hey, my missing boxing glove.
[95:36.07]Whoa, he's got one.
[95:36.73]That's my lucky glove.
[95:38.46]Cut.
[95:39.35]Jimmy Tootie, what are you and your unsavory pals doing in the burned out husk of this robot?
[95:45.30]The first rule is, we don't talk about what goes on in the burned out husk of this robot.
[95:50.54]Hey, eat horse.
[95:52.12]Give it to me.
[95:53.16]Nothin', do it.
[95:54.60]That's my championship trophy, and I want it fair and square.
[95:59.33]That's my trophy.
[96:00.55]I could probably get it if I tried.
[96:02.87]They're giving out trophies now?
[96:04.49]Boxing championship, wise guy.
[96:07.53]See ya, suckers.
[96:09.67]Okay, so how do we get him a boxing championship?
[96:12.77]Well, isn't that funny?
[96:13.83]Boxing Betty.
[96:14.41]What are you going to do with this?
[96:21.68]Do I have to play this, or are they going to do it on their own?
[96:35.56]wally glass jaw puddle sniffer gabby j our challenger okay hold on we got five communities up from pilot guy thank you the five sub pilot guy
[97:02.23]Appreciate it.
[97:04.35]Thank you.
[97:06.07]Coming in with subs.
[97:08.61]What do we got?
[97:08.99]We can move your mouse left and right to dodge and click either mouse button to punch or use the keyboard.
[97:14.15]I'm gonna use the keyboard.
[97:15.77]Use the left and right arrow keys to dodge and then use A or D to punch.
[97:20.23]So it really is punch up.
[97:24.45]It is punch up.
[97:30.86]Left hook, knock him out.
[97:32.28]And he's out cold.
[97:37.43]Did he win?
[97:39.97]Yo.
[97:40.53]A new opponent.
[97:42.35]More punch out?
[97:42.99]Uh-oh.
[97:43.37]The dumpster outside clock mark.
[97:47.95]The rat whose barber didn't know when to stop.
[97:53.88]The pride of the skin body moves.
[98:00.51]Bald bull.
[98:02.43]Do I have to actually do the bald bull mechanic?
[98:07.81]He like runs in.
[98:08.37]Who's left?
[98:26.99]Final opponent?
[98:30.61]The giant rat.
[98:32.21]He's got a huge glove!
[98:34.96]Can I not dodge that glove?
[98:46.73]And maybe I can't dodge that side.
[98:48.51]We'll find out.
[98:51.51]No, he can.
[98:53.95]Ooh, that was quick!
[98:57.21]Left jab.
[99:00.22]Left hook.
[99:00.84]A left.
[99:02.58]Right hook.
[99:03.10]Put him away.
[99:03.82]One more.
[99:07.38]Right hook.
[99:07.68]And Jimmy goes down.
[99:08.94]Foxy Vinny is the new champion.
[99:13.70]Another right hand.
[99:17.94]It's the super exclusive four-action figure with extra pieces missing.
[99:23.51]I don't see the weapons of mass destruction.
[99:25.67]Eh, who needs them?
[99:28.01]How could I lose?
[99:29.57]I'm no expert, Jimmy.
[99:31.24]But I bet being a loser helped.
[99:33.98]You're right.
[99:35.62]I can't go on like this.
[99:37.38]Goodbye, cruel world.
[99:39.32]Oh, nice going, Max.
[99:40.60]I think they kind of need to update the four horsemen, don't you think?
[99:44.56]I always thought guys appreciated a bracing, candid reality check.
[99:48.46]Your suicide causation rate suggests otherwise.
[99:51.48]Like, where's the horseman of identity theft?
[99:54.38]I'll jump, I tell ya.
[99:55.68]Hang on a second, Jimmy.
[100:00.60]That's a huge problem right now.
[100:01.78]Where's the horsemen of... You know, like of pestilence, famine... No, where's the horsemen of low Instagram likes?
[100:14.72]That's what we care about now.
[100:22.13]Suicide isn't the answer, things will turn up.
[100:23.93]Think of your loved ones.
[100:31.29]Oh, I struck a nerve on that one.
[100:36.77]Oh, people are getting defensive here.
[100:47.39]Wait, what did he say?
[100:48.09]What did he say about me?
[100:49.91]What did he say?
[100:52.41]I'll bite him.
[100:58.73]Alright.
[101:01.27]I have a big question.
[101:02.19]I make like a millennial, like, zoomer joke.
[101:11.95]How many times have you wrote boomer jokes in here?
[101:14.56]What, I'm allowed to just take them, but I can't dish it out?
[101:18.04]What's up with that?
[101:25.26]Sometimes you guys gotta play defense.
[101:27.18]It's not all offense.
[101:34.45]Try to land?
[101:35.17]Oh my god.
[101:36.04]It's not funny when you're making fun of me.
[101:38.12]Think of your loved ones.
[101:59.34]Jesus Christ, that's fuckin' awful.
[102:00.64]Thank God.
[102:01.42]Um, I don't know.
[102:29.68]Max, I don't think this is helping.
[102:31.62]I disagree, Sam.
[102:32.96]I feel much better about myself already.
[102:43.88]Well, do I have any items?
[102:51.54]Maze?
[102:53.20]Jimmy, care to try out a maze?
[102:55.59]No way.
[102:56.47]I ain't falling for that.
[102:59.01]I'm not gonna shoot him!
[103:02.83]That's not gonna do anything.
[103:04.51]No, Jimmy's gonna have to do this for himself.
[103:06.90]Oh, God.
[103:07.42]You guys... Nobody's home.
[103:24.97]I love that sound.
[103:27.21]I love just how I make like a like a zoomer reference and all of a sudden it's just like BOOM chat explodes with HEY!
[103:40.78]That's so fucking funny, I love it.
[103:43.62]Can I talk to- I can't talk to the other rat, I don't think.
[103:48.88]Throw a snowball at him, it's gonna melt, it's like a 16 hour car ride.
[103:59.33]But can I... Maybe... Where is he?
[104:02.17]I'm gonna land... Where's my office?
[104:03.27]Where's the window?
[104:05.02]Hold on, wait a minute.
[104:05.84]Nope.
[104:15.96]Well, let's listen to the answering machine.
[104:20.28]What is that sound?
[104:21.18]Oh.
[104:29.87]Do you have leather stick charmer in the closet?
[104:34.64]Then you should see a doctor about that.
[104:37.58]No, wait.
[104:38.70]Let me start over.
[104:39.98]Max, crank calls only work when you call someone besides us.
[104:43.06]This is the only phone number I can remember, Sam.
[104:47.08]You know when you rewind and relive moments?
[104:56.49]I want to relive that one.
[105:10.56]I love it.
[105:11.34]I love it.
[105:13.83]I love this.
[105:14.61]It's so much fun.
[105:16.55]Alright, let's go.
[105:23.13]Let's go back to the North Pole.
[105:24.35]I need a snowfall.
[105:25.33]A new... Okay.
[105:38.67]So I have two horsemen.
[105:40.09]I have the record.
[105:40.87]Hmm.
[105:46.90]Nothing can be done with these two.
[105:48.96]What do I do with the snowball?
[105:51.76]Can I bring the snowball back and throw it at him?
[105:56.22]Let's see.
[105:56.90]There's a time limit on it, so let's go.
[106:00.31]Where to, Sam?
[106:02.45]Let's head back to civilization, or what's left of it.
[106:08.19]Wait, why would I do that?
[106:15.22]To throw the snowball at the rat?
[106:16.60]To stop him from jumping off the ledge?
[106:23.68]Wouldn't this knock him off the ledge?
[106:27.95]Being hit with a bleak snowball at this range could cause permanent blindness.
[106:31.61]And?
[106:31.79]I usually draw the line at temporary blindness.
[106:34.27]That's not how it works.
[106:35.64]Ah, Bosco's maybe?
[106:37.06]Ah, I don't know.
[106:40.00]Let's try Bosco's again.
[106:41.92]Do you ever look at your subreddit all the time?
[106:52.35]Being hit with a bleached snowball at this range could cause permanent blindness.
[106:56.09]And?
[106:56.87]I usually draw the line at temporary blindness.
[106:59.19]Microwave?
[107:00.99]Microwave the snowball?
[107:02.01]I don't know.
[107:03.43]Does he have one?
[107:05.72]Something with the gifts.
[107:07.06]Save, Osko.
[107:07.84]We'll take that package off your hands for you.
[107:10.14]Step back, boy.
[107:10.92]That's mine.
[107:18.06]Get away from me!
[107:19.54]I can't, like, occupy his brain with a maze?
[107:26.33]Maybe... I probably have to send him... Wait, hold on.
[107:30.06]Gift tags?
[107:31.18]Maybe make him think it's not... Hmm.
[107:39.56]X-ray machine... It's probably something to do with sending him a present.
[107:43.62]What's going on with the refrigerator?
[107:55.33]Yeah, but what Reddit?
[107:56.37]I think they said your Reddit.
[107:58.15]Alright.
[107:58.31]This is the bathroom.
[108:19.99]It's something to do with a gift.
[108:22.03]X-ray viewer?
[108:23.79]Ooh!
[108:24.23]Oh!
[108:25.23]It's in there!
[108:25.89]Alright, we have to send Bosco a present.
[108:29.52]We're gonna send Bosco a present, and I'm gonna take this one.
[108:38.22]So, we gotta get a package sent to him, and it's gonna be green, and it's gonna be a... a clock?
[108:46.23]Clock.
[108:46.59]Send him a clock.
[108:47.81]Got it.
[108:48.29]I win.
[108:49.87]It's sometimes, it's just so easy.
[108:53.45]I get headaches all the time, like my brain is so fucking huge it can barely be in the skull.
[108:58.97]It's just like, I wanna just let it come out, you know what I mean?
[109:00.92]Whee!
[109:02.44]That's what my mother used to tell me.
[109:08.58]Where to, Sam?
[109:10.16]Mom, I have a really bad headache.
[109:12.09]That's cause you got such a big brain, sweetie.
[109:15.11]We're off to the North Pole.
[109:29.70]That's not true.
[109:32.89]Your mom lied.
[109:40.27]Jesus, guys, oh my god.
[109:44.40]Yeah, Neanderthals have big brains too.
[109:47.74]Yeah, but they didn't know how to use them.
[109:52.38]Okay, so now I get a gift.
[110:01.97]Bingo.
[110:03.24]Obsessomatic stopwatch.
[110:04.58]It's going to Bosco.
[110:06.00]Gift tag.
[110:06.36]To Bosco.
[110:06.94]You know.
[110:07.30]It's not green though.
[110:07.92]Does that matter?
[110:32.38]I don't think that matters.
[110:33.30]Brain's thickness does not equal smartness.
[110:43.09]For example, blue whales.
[110:44.41]But you're talking about not a human.
[110:47.09]Let's go get it.
[111:01.12]How do you know?
[111:03.08]How do you know how smart a blue whale is?
[111:09.50]Have you talked to a blue whale before?
[111:12.02]No, scientists have like dropped cameras down to the deep sea and taken a few pictures and put it on like... Instagram, trying to get a bunch of likes.
[111:29.34]Dude, what is with the... If I... Okay.
[111:32.48]Something's... We're gonna talk after this.
[111:35.14]It's gotta be my mama's bomb.
[111:39.70]I'm gonna blow it to kingdom comes.
[111:42.78]Where's the other one?
[111:47.86]Well, he's distracted, Max.
[111:49.04]Grab the package and let's get...
[111:52.36]Look, Sam, it's the supersized famine figure with realistic binging and purging action.
[111:57.72]It's got over 1700 points of articulation, 250 in the jowls alone.
[112:03.32]You never were good at waiting to open presents, little buddy.
[112:10.13]Wait, where's my package?
[112:11.79]Dear God, they took it and they took Sam and Max too.
[112:16.73]There ain't no place safe.
[112:20.17]Alright, so listen.
[112:22.24]The word Instagram has the immediate, innate, complete opposite reaction of the word shpee.
[112:30.95]Think about that.
[112:31.63]When I say, oh, an Instagram, oh, hey, hey, oh, oh, oh, shut up.
[112:37.89]Shpee.
[112:38.47]Woohoo!
[112:47.28]I'm gonna fuck up you guys right now.
[112:48.77]You ready?
[112:50.01]Instagram likes.
[112:51.03]Shpee!
[112:51.71]Instagram likes.
[112:52.81]Instagram.
[112:54.01]Shpee!
[112:54.49]Shpee!
[113:01.71]Where to, Sam?
[113:03.06]What do I do?
[113:03.64]What do I do?
[113:06.90]I need one more.
[113:08.04]Let's just stay here.
[113:09.66]Aw, you never take me anywhere.
[113:11.38]I just took you to the North Pole.
[113:14.71]That's how I beat the villain at the end of the movie.
[113:18.43]I used that tactic.
[113:19.59]That's all they had to do.
[113:20.39]I beat the robot villain at the end of the movie.
[113:24.93]I win.
[113:35.16]You are the villain.
[113:36.96]Sometimes the villain wins.
[113:42.30]I better be careful, though, because the villain only temporarily... No, the villain can, like... And we gotta be careful, because, like, the villain... Somehow, always, in every form of media... Is like, wait!
[113:55.80]I'm not a bad guy, so I can't... But sometimes they do.
[114:01.70]Sometimes they do, guys.
[114:10.69]I need one more.
[114:15.59]Can I go in here?
[114:17.41]There's actually been, like, quite a few movies and TV shows where the bad guy did win.
[114:22.51]I can name you a few very recent ones.
[114:25.79]Uh-huh.
[114:36.28]Like... Wait, what?
[114:39.02]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[114:40.02]What, like... I'm not gonna... I don't even know what you mean by this, but I'm... Hold on.
[114:46.48]I'm trying to piece that together in my brain.
[114:52.48]Megamind.
[114:56.30]Does Megamind win?
[115:10.43]But at the end of the movie, does Megamind lose?
[115:13.83]You know what I mean?
[115:14.63]Like I'm saying, I love when they skirt around tropes like that.
[115:20.27]I'm spoiling Megamind.
[115:24.67]No, what?
[115:34.32]I didn't spo- I just said that's a trope in movies, like the bad guy doesn't win!
[115:38.42]I didn't mean to- I didn't spoil Megamind!
[115:48.45]Standing up all day getting you down?
[115:50.23]And how?
[115:51.81]I was made for sunning beachside in Capri.
[115:54.24]You just spoiled every single movie.
[115:59.67]That's not how that works, okay?
[116:01.93]Just because somebody says, the bad guy doesn't always win.
[116:05.86]The bad guy wins, but the bad guy doesn't always win.
[116:09.28]It just explains you every piece of fucking media.
[116:12.90]And guess what?
[116:14.24]There's a bad guy in this one, too.
[116:15.78]Sometimes the bad guy won in episode three.
[116:18.73]Bad guy didn't win in episode five.
[116:21.85]What do you mean?
[116:22.75]I'm spoiling every fucking movie.
[116:25.89]Every single piece of media.
[116:32.59]That's not, come on.
[116:37.13]Megamind, who cares?
[116:43.96]So long.
[116:45.30]Megamind was like a fucking Will Ferrell movie that came out between like two other Will Ferrell movies.
[116:53.32]That was like a Will Ferrell 1.4 in the middle of like a 1.0 Will Ferrell and 2.0 Will Ferrell.
[117:00.57]You don't care about Megamind.
[117:01.75]I didn't spoil Megamind.
[117:03.13]I just asked a question.
[117:08.75]What do you mean Will Ferrell's not even in it?
[117:12.66]Will Ferrell is Megamind.
[117:28.01]I've always believed that destiny chooses our path in life.
[117:31.37]I don't even need to... I just watched the first five seconds of the trailer and it's Will Ferrell.
[117:33.89]I can't believe you spoiled Megamind.
[117:41.50]Where to, Sam?
[117:42.58]You said the bad guy doesn't win in movies.
[117:47.34]We're off to the North Pole.
[117:49.32]Oh, no!
[117:50.76]I could never play Super Mario Brothers ever again!
[117:53.52]I could never play any...
[118:03.59]Streamer says it's okay to spoil movies if you don't care.
[118:09.25]That's not... Alright, we're done with this.
[118:11.50]Oh no, wait, the bad guy doesn't always... the bad guy doesn't win in movies.
[118:27.91]I like when the bad guy wins, but the bad guy doesn't win.
[118:35.93]You mean to tell me that Bowser is not gonna win?
[118:38.99]I thought this time when he captured the princess it was gonna work!
[118:52.10]Can we start the exorcism now?
[118:53.99]Nope.
[118:54.51]We still need three more horsemen.
[118:56.33]Let's hurry!
[118:57.21]I've got a sudden, inexplicable craving for pea soup!
[119:06.72]Bowser does win in one of the games, but that's what I'm saying.
[119:09.42]What are you talking about?
[119:10.78]Bowser is like a... wins sometimes, but he loses all the time.
[119:12.27]Okay, I gotta get one more horseman.
[119:14.05]It's definitely not here.
[119:15.29]It's something to do with this shit, but it's not here.
[119:41.39]How does he win sometimes if he loses all the time?
[119:45.65]I don't know.
[119:49.87]No, one snowball is probably more than enough.
[119:54.15]So basically what you're saying is sometimes different things happen in movies.
[120:00.68]Sure.
[120:01.42]And everybody lost their mind.
[120:03.40]I don't even know where Megamind came from.
[120:05.90]Or what's left of it.
[120:10.13]Where the fuck did Megamind come from?
[120:24.25]I don't even know what happened.
[120:27.93]Garage.
[120:31.23]Oh, it was the Villains Win Movies.
[120:34.66]No, because you guys called me a villain, and I said, hey, the villain wins sometimes, doesn't he?
[120:38.34]And then all of a sudden... I wasn't making it.
[120:40.28]Alright, well, these guys... There it is, there it is.
[120:42.98]How do I get this?
[121:13.99]A recent influx of road debris will result in a projected 64% increase in revenue.
[121:33.36]Road debris?
[121:34.36]From the main trunk?
[121:35.64]My hero!
[121:37.60]No!
[121:38.34]A shipping mishap from the North Pole has resulted in a glut of unwanted torture-me-elmer-dolls!
[121:45.26]Destroy them all!
[121:49.24]Okay, you don't like torture-me-elmer.
[121:50.98]What have you got against torture-me-elmer?
[121:52.66]Show-offs!
[121:54.84]My associates were once the most popular toys available, but no more.
[122:00.20]Beating up a doll cannot compare with the wonder and excitement of arithmetic and grammar.
[122:07.54]Uh-oh, Max.
[122:08.60]I think the cops may have been educational toys.
[122:11.31]I knew there was a reason I didn't like them!
[122:16.13]Uh, you know how to fix cars.
[122:17.43]So do you know anything about cars?
[122:19.19]If we didn't, why would we open a car shop?
[122:22.77]Because you're lonely, forgotten machines who'd do anything to feel useful?
[122:26.26]Alright.
[122:26.96]We want a hybrid.
[122:28.10]Okay.
[122:56.64]Torture Me Elmer is the hottest toy this season.
[122:59.20]Elmer appeals to the lowest common denominator.
[123:03.66]He's a solo!
[123:08.56]We'd like to pimp our car.
[123:10.62]Please make a selection from the following menu.
[123:14.16]If you'd like the exclusive Death Horseman hood ornament, press 1-9.
[123:17.12]And what else?
[123:20.82]That is all we have.
[123:22.22]There was an ordering malfunction.
[123:24.76]Totally not my fault!
[123:27.26]Actually, we also offer a wide range of completely worthless decorative decals.
[123:33.87]Uh, we want that horseman.
[123:35.97]We'll take that death horseman hood ornament.
[123:38.09]Excellent!
[123:38.79]First, however, you must complete the Pimplica driving challenge.
[123:42.82]Oh no.
[123:43.88]Oh, just give us the horse!
[123:45.44]Video game challenge.
[123:46.30]Where is the son in that?
[123:48.81]our years of experience in designing the most advanced computer games to bring you the ultimate augmented reality driving experience.
[123:56.19]Augmented reality?
[123:57.59]Yes.

[124:03.55]Okay.

[124:15.10]Would you like to try the driving challenge now?
[124:19.04]Yes.
[124:19.86]And how.
[124:20.75]Eat my dust.
[124:22.09]Initiating augmented reality driving sequence.
[124:29.08]So I have to just win this driving challenge?
[124:33.68]Elmer's hit.
[124:34.86]I have to run over Elmer's.
[124:36.48]Can I use that?
[124:37.60]Okay, let me use this.
[124:39.40]How many do I have to hit?
[124:41.12]Thirty.
[124:41.38]I can get that.
[125:00.30]Well, let's go!
[125:01.70]Just go!
[125:02.46]That's right!
[125:11.45]I'm not efficient.
[125:12.35]Fuck!
[125:13.19]Once they put the pressure on, I can't do it!
[125:27.86]I got it.
[125:29.72]I win!
[125:30.94]I don't.
[125:31.80]Excellent!
[125:34.30]Please accept this exclusive hood ornament with our compliment.
[125:53.35]Got them all.
[125:53.89]I didn't skip that.
[125:54.93]It was over.
[125:55.63]I didn't skip it.
[125:57.29]I didn't skip that!
[126:16.05]What's this about decorative decals?
[126:18.17]We can outfit your ride with a wide assortment of decorative embellishments created by our in-house auto-detailing artists!
[126:26.38]How does he do that?
[126:27.36]His mother was your label maker.
[126:30.14]Simply hit the street and obliterate rare objects.
[126:33.92]If we deem them suitably interesting, we will reward you with a decal to commemorate the joyous destruction.
[126:39.52]Now that's my kind of game!
[126:41.42]What should we be obliterating?
[126:43.08]That is for you to determine.
[126:47.55]Okay.
[126:49.37]So no details.
[126:50.29]Alright, give me the horseman.
[126:52.95]Do I just have it in my inventory?
[126:55.20]I don't.
[126:55.78]I don't, I don't.
[126:58.80]There it is.
[126:59.32]Give it to me.
[127:01.60]Horseman of Death.
[127:06.98]Complete the exorcism.
[127:12.50]It's time to make a horror movie.
[127:15.62]It's time to have first and last name, and then the bad thing that happened to them, as the title of the movie.
[127:23.05]Off to the North Pole.
[127:30.20]The exorcism has ebony rose.
[127:47.32]Jenny Stevenson goes to hell.
[128:00.65]Whee!
[128:07.19]That's the last one.
[128:08.67]Now we just have to sing the incantation.
[128:10.77]Do we have to?
[128:12.13]The haunting of Will Ferrell.
[128:14.39]Possibly the entire Earth as we know it, yes.
[128:16.90]It still hardly seems worth it.
[128:21.13]I feel like that could be a real movie.
[128:22.35]Alright, here we go.
[128:25.85]Let's do it.
[128:29.34]Let's put on the friendly demon song.
[128:45.58]It was a gelatinous goo.
[128:47.08]Yeah, Manitoba.
[128:54.56]Uh, Mime Sweeper.
[128:56.66]Corporate presents.
[129:02.41]The Four Horsemen.
[129:14.82]Suck him up.
[129:16.49]Roy G. Beard.
[129:19.11]It worked.
[129:19.97]The power of Christmas compels you.
[129:22.75]Any second now, Santa's going to walk out that door demon-free and fill us with gifts like an absentee dad and a filthy conscience.
[129:29.78]Did it work?
[129:30.50]Yes.
[129:32.58]Wait.
[129:32.82]But he... You mean... But I thought... But I thought... What?
[129:36.72]No.
[129:37.40]Why quit?
[129:45.74]Feliz Navidad, baby.
[129:49.76]What?
[129:50.30]Nothing?
[129:51.12]Didn't you guys read the back of the instructions?
[129:53.45]There's a back?
[129:58.53]Feeling hungry?
[129:59.65]My $5 fill-up box will do.
[130:01.45]I'm sorry.
[130:02.59]Very important.
[130:04.09]Make sure you have the spirits of Christmas to contain the beast, or you're screwed.
[130:09.11]Salmon Knox, it's up to you to save Christmas.
[130:12.61]Yep, we're screwed.
[130:19.86]Sorry, I had to just ruin that.
[130:21.24]I'm sorry.
[130:21.70]I'm having too much fun today.
[130:25.38]You know what I mean?
[130:26.76]I gotta like stop having fun.
[130:28.23]I gotta like shut up and not have fun, right?
[130:30.35]Alright, so let's investigate.
[130:36.05]Can we just go in the room though?
[130:45.87]I just got $45 for that joke.
[130:48.43]Do you know what episode of that joke deserved these bits?
[130:50.07]Thanks for the $45 joke.
[130:51.13]That was just for you.
[130:54.72]Thank you, though.
[130:55.88]It's a lot of money.
[131:02.72]Christmas past, present, and future.
[131:07.56]You know us?
[131:08.74]We know all those who have ever ruined Christmas, especially the repeat offenders.
[131:16.01]Who are you guys?
[131:17.31]Take the spirit of Christmas past, brothers.
[131:22.45]I am the spirit of Christmas present.
[131:26.55]And that cat's the spirit of Christmas yet to come.
[131:30.59]He's shy.
[131:32.59]What's your 20, good buddies?
[131:34.64]We could use some help saving Christmas.
[131:36.65]We're not bad people.
[131:38.09]We've just had bad luck with major holidays.
[131:41.16]And automobiles.
[131:42.30]And federal statutes.
[131:44.12]It is your own selfish actions that have brought this to pass.
[131:49.02]Selfish?
[131:50.17]We're freelance police.
[131:51.99]We save the world.
[131:53.51]Sometimes on purpose.
[131:55.13]You got no clue the bad karma you've built up, man.
[131:59.09]You will need the combined help of all three of us to defeat the demon.
[132:05.45]We will show you three Christmases you've ruined.
[132:09.62]Set them right and we will consent to help you.
[132:14.02]Where are you going?
[132:15.14]I have to get some air.
[132:16.88]I'm going to talk shit right now.
[132:19.56]Pause it for a second.
[132:21.72]Somebody said when the game is funnier than the streamer.
[132:25.56]Well, I'm sorry.
[132:27.20]I'm talking in real time here.
[132:29.80]By myself.
[132:30.90]Over a video game that I'm just seeing for the first time.
[132:34.07]Of course the game's gonna... They had, like, years to make this game.
[132:37.97]With a team of writers.
[132:39.89]Who, every day for months, came up with jokes.
[132:43.25]What?
[132:45.80]Of course there's gonna be better humor in here.
[132:47.40]They had, like, a year and a half to write the jokes.
[132:50.08]You gave me ten seconds.
[132:52.72]Sorry I spoiled Megamind.
[132:55.22]That's what this is about.
[132:55.98]I know it is.
[132:56.92]That's what this is about.
[132:57.68]They're mad because I spoiled fucking Megamind on them.
[133:07.57]Hey, Sam.
[133:08.27]What time is it?
[133:09.19]Let's see.
[133:10.37]Uh, the little hand is on the freckle and the corncob pipe is on the right eyeball.
[133:14.60]Already?
[133:15.88]Where does the time go?
[133:22.03]Look at this.
[133:22.99]It's Santa's magical stocking stuffer.
[133:25.35]It fills a sock with whatever gift the owner deserves.
[133:28.59]Ooh, let's try it.
[133:29.93]I think we'd need to have socks first.
[133:31.87]I was going to see them in theaters after this stream.
[133:33.69]That's a record of what people got in their stockings.
[133:35.49]You know how they... Jenny A. Nice kid.
[133:38.19]Sock full of toys.
[133:39.15]I know we're still on this, but... Meanswell.
[133:41.59]Sock full of candy.
[133:42.95]Steven G. Liar.
[133:45.21]Sock full of coal.
[133:48.64]You know when they bring back movies for a limited run in the theaters?
[133:53.84]What if they brought Megamind back for another run in the theaters for some reason?
[133:58.06]They bring it to IMAX or something or 3D for a couple months.
[134:03.40]Oh man, that would be fucking hilarious.
[134:05.90]But why would they ever do that?
[134:07.08]That's such a forgettable movie.
[134:08.88]Not that it was a bad movie, right?
[134:10.14]Listen, it's just not a movie you would bring back.
[134:12.90]It didn't win any Academy Awards.
[134:26.84]That's my son's favorite movie.
[134:29.50]That's fine.
[134:31.30]I didn't say it was a bad movie.
[134:34.28]A concrete car, thanks for the five community subs.
[134:40.23]There's a lot in this one.
[134:41.95]There's, like, a bunch of different things to do.
[134:44.41]Thanks for the five subs.
[134:46.67]And see if you'll glow in the dark?
[134:56.93]A team of writers spent months writing Megamind.
[135:02.93]Of course it's gonna be better than this stream.
[135:06.43]The game crashed.
[135:07.63]Uh-oh.
[135:11.75]I didn't save it once.
[135:15.55]Is there an autosave here?
[135:22.82]No, okay, I think we're fine.
[135:23.98]I just had a- my stomach just hurt for a second.
[135:25.94]I was like, that was two hours.
[135:27.70]Gone.
[135:32.42]Oh boy, I hope so.
[135:40.33]Come on.
[135:45.83]What is this?
[135:46.27]Where is this?
[135:47.50]This- okay, this is- I'm fucking having a little panic attack here, because this could- this is the first image of the beginning of the game.
[136:02.31]Oh, thank God.
[136:03.15]Okay.
[136:04.00]Alright, well, let's go to the future.
[136:13.50]I guess this leads to some dystopian future Christmas.
[136:16.83]You say that about everything.
[136:18.67]But this time I'm right.
[136:29.36]Wow, the future is hot.
[136:31.36]And so am I, Sam.
[136:33.00]Seriously, check future me out.
[136:35.56]Smoking!
[136:36.52]The future.
[136:39.06]Oh no, we're spoiling our future.
[136:40.36]Unless we learn how to fly, we're destined to spend the remainder of our days on a tiny outcropping surrounded by impossibly hot lava, ash, and soot.
[136:48.16]I don't mind, Sam, as long as I'm with my best friend.
[136:52.00]Oh, that's sweet, little pal.
[136:54.04]Hey, give me one of those pork rinds you were carrying.
[136:56.82]Sorry, buddy.
[136:57.36]I already ate them all.
[137:01.91]Somebody help!
[137:03.73]Spirit, why would you show us this if we were powerless to change our snackless fate?
[137:09.47]Surely we can alter these shadows before us.
[137:12.36]Perhaps with a larger, economy-sized bag of pork rinds.
[137:16.16]Or chips!
[137:17.40]You know, Max, we could find a way to get our future selves out of this place.
[137:21.02]Yeah, I guess that'd work.
[137:30.49]Okay.
[137:32.35]So, uh, what's the scenario here?
[137:33.83]We need to get snacks or something?
[137:37.19]We probably have to change the past?
[137:42.16]We probably have to bounce around between them.
[137:48.56]Yes, our future selves are trapped to die on a tiny outcropping of ash surrounded by roiling magma.
[137:54.58]But what is it we're here to fix?
[137:58.72]Hold on, hold on before everybody screams.
[138:00.52]I thought you can't talk to yourself.
[138:04.62]You'll crack me up at some later time, little future buddy.
[138:07.36]Don't I crack you up now, Sam?
[138:09.43]Sorry, pal.
[138:10.27]His material just seems fresher somehow.
[138:14.41]Hey, future me.
[138:15.69]Would it hurt you to hit the treadmill once in a while?
[138:17.95]Did you say something, Max?
[138:19.51]You mean after we're gonna die, it burns, it burns?
[138:23.50]Topical.
[138:24.84]What do you mean?
[138:26.54]Anything else in here?
[138:30.24]No, just lava.
[138:31.12]Alright, let's go to the past.
[138:46.67]Game saved.
[138:48.31]I'm so glad they added that run, it really is great.
[138:50.21]What was the present?
[138:50.93]Aren't we already in the present?
[138:51.94]How does that make any sense?
[138:54.65]Alright, don't crash.
[139:19.07]Ooh, we're back here.
[139:19.99]Here we are in your office in the not-too-distant past.
[139:24.13]I remember this.
[139:25.51]This is when we had to retrieve the Toy Mafia's meatball sandwich that Leonard tried to fence to Jimmy.
[139:30.27]Do we get to beat up Leonard some more?
[139:32.34]No way, Max.
[139:33.72]These cats can't sense your presence in any way.
[139:36.68]Dig?
[139:37.52]You are here to right a terrible wrong you once committed.
[139:41.58]We have to stop ourselves from doing yo mama jokes?
[139:44.46]Just watch.
[139:47.40]Stop ourselves from doing karate jokes?
[139:49.98]Hello?
[139:50.98]Guys?
[139:51.92]Jimmy?
[139:52.80]Anybody?
[139:55.32]Well, Jimmy, where's this big scar that's gonna change everything?
[139:59.78]Where's all the money that's gonna save our dear tiny Timmy?
[140:03.30]Yes, Daddy.
[140:04.54]Where the f*** is it?
[140:06.35]Oh, it's hopeless.
[140:07.91]The doctors say his Tourette's Syndrome will kill him if they don't operate soon.
[140:12.15]Don't cry, Mommy.
[140:13.57]I'll get the f*** with the f***, the f***, the f***.
[140:18.17]It's all a bust, Mary.
[140:19.87]Every time I try to make an honest living, Sam and Max smack me down.
[140:26.28]Jimmy, we were all counting on you.
[140:29.02]I know, Mary, I know.
[140:31.46]If only I'd have stuck to boxing, I could have been somebody.
[140:36.12]Alright, so we got to... Instead of being a wreck, which is what I am.
[140:39.80]Stop them from boxing?
[140:40.80]So get your lucky boxing glove and go fight.
[140:43.61]This is bad.
[140:44.65]Poor Jimmy.
[141:21.58]Oh my god!
[141:22.56]I'll go call the doctor to ease his suffering.
[141:26.11]Just get that glove, Jimmy.
[141:27.89]Our baby doesn't have much time to live.
[141:30.63]Can't say all that on TV.
[141:31.77]That's probably a $400,000 FCC fine.
[141:32.79]Alright, so...
[141:43.39]We have to... We have to... Get the box... He has to be a boxer in... Boxer.
[141:53.82]So I gotta get the glove.
[141:56.36]So I have to give him the glove.
[142:00.31]Um...
[142:04.93]We can't interact with anybody, can we?
[142:06.11]So... We need to get the glove from Jimmy in the present to give to Jimmy in the past.
[142:11.60]So we have to get Jimmy to not...
[142:32.54]Jump off the ledge to get the glove to bring to here.
[142:45.44]Alright, so how do I get the glove from Jimmy?
[142:49.16]That's the real question.
[142:50.28]Hold on.
[142:50.93]Can you tell me?
[142:51.67]I have to go back and lose?
[142:53.15]Yeah, get him a glove.
[143:17.68]I need to- I know I have to stop him from suiciding, I know!
[143:21.18]But the question is how?
[143:24.24]You don't gotta all caps me and sp- I just said I knew that's what I had to do!
[143:28.22]Alright, uh... So what does the present do?
[143:43.69]Prepare yourselves for a journey beyond imagination as we enter the present.
[143:59.06]Sam and Max, witness how your reckless carelessness hurts those... Wait a second.
[144:04.56]This isn't the present.
[144:06.14]You took us to the past.
[144:07.85]Past us are standing right there.
[144:09.35]Yeah, this is the past.
[144:10.01]I know that.
[144:11.15]Just give it a minute to catch up.
[144:15.11]That's the limited edition Pestilence maquette with super detailed open sores.
[144:20.22]Aw, see how he slumps in his saddle.
[144:22.14]Does he have any cool action features?
[144:23.84]Cut it out, Max.
[144:25.02]You don't know what that'll do.
[144:26.50]What's the worst a toy could do?
[144:28.41]Choke a toddler?
[144:29.39]Blind a toddler?
[144:30.67]Hmm.
[144:31.49]Emviscerate?
[144:32.61]Well, it looks like nothing happened anyway.
[144:34.49]Let's go.
[144:36.04]Oh, no.
[144:37.18]Seriously, we had a totally boss bug-summoning toy, and we wasted it on a stupid exorcism.
[144:43.22]Chain Hut!
[144:44.30]That's two, Sergeant.
[144:45.67]What?
[144:46.31]How did you stink bugs find me?
[144:48.27]This place is great.
[144:50.11]Baby brother too good to share with his family?
[144:52.73]Too good to break radio silence and call his father anyway.
[144:56.07]Been on important missions, ma'am.
[144:58.02]Been hanging out with those filthy dung-beings more like me.
[145:01.28]Alright.
[145:32.47]Let me see.
[145:33.13]We've got gift tags, simplest maze, and spirit bottle.
[145:38.64]The maze is definitely something here.
[145:42.70]Can I, like, do something with the maze?
[145:44.84]Not happening.
[145:46.02]What do I do with the maze?
[145:46.78]I've had it for a long time.
[145:47.98]Hello, sir.
[145:48.98]He can't hear us, Sam.
[145:51.50]What is that?
[145:52.80]It smells like wet ghost dog.
[145:54.92]Maybe can I do the maze to the rats?
[145:57.17]Well, I didn't think it was that funny, but whatever turns you on.
[146:00.49]I didn't say that.
[146:01.27]The bug did.
[146:03.74]What else is in here?
[146:05.85]Hey, Sybil.
[146:06.77]Oh, she can't hear us.
[146:09.29]Hey, Abe.
[146:10.27]Oh, he can't hear us.
[146:12.15]Oh.
[146:14.63]Think it'd scare anyone if we started playing the jukebox?
[146:17.84]Probably.
[146:18.82]Your taste in music scares even me.
[146:22.18]Can't change the channel.
[146:26.42]Anything else over here?
[146:27.20]Hey, Stinky.
[146:32.64]Oh, she can't hear us.
[146:33.64]Alright, well, bug family.
[146:42.46]Anybody else feel that?
[146:43.90]Sure did.
[146:45.30]Some kind of angry, violent presence.
[146:48.36]And strangely familiar.
[146:50.20]Is that you, Dad?
[146:51.48]We haven't seen him since the attack of the cleaners.
[146:54.33]Give us a sign, Father.
[146:57.05]Okay.
[146:58.96]So, the idea here is... What if I just go back?
[147:08.35]Maybe press the button on the... No, but I don't have it there.
[147:15.99]Let's go out of here.
[147:18.37]Let me try the maze on the right.
[147:20.19]Why would that do anything, though?
[147:26.33]The future doesn't... There's nothing there.
[147:31.21]I mean, I'm in the... I can still do stuff now.
[147:39.48]Let me just see what this does.
[147:40.58]I'm going to try just the maze here and see if I can put it down.
[147:45.46]No.
[147:45.52]No.
[148:05.56]nope I gotta get him off the ledge the booze maybe like how do I get him that's how I get the glove I need to get we go back to the reality here the real reality can I give him like the booze
[148:36.91]What is this thing?
[148:37.87]Oh, that's the corporate presence.
[148:39.13]I mean, yeah, you'd think the rat maze would do it, but... I was clicking on Jimmy.
[148:47.78]Do I have to click on the kid?
[149:11.20]Timmy this, uh, here we go, hold on.
[149:13.80]Timmy Two-Teeth.
[149:14.80]Oh, come on.
[149:15.38]Really?
[149:15.62]I...
[149:41.86]So now in the... So now if I go into the present... Is she gonna be in there?
[149:52.57]And she's gonna come out and I'm gonna make her talk him off the ledge.
[150:11.51]Hold on.
[150:16.10]Let's head back to civilization, or what's left of it.
[150:18.68]Let's see if she's in there.
[150:48.21]Okay.
[150:49.17]Now is this here?
[150:55.31]It's not there!
[150:56.55]Wait, is he on the window?
[150:57.35]Wait a minute.
[150:57.79]Wait, hold on a second.
[151:01.91]Is he... Was he on the window?
[151:19.69]Didn't do it Wait, let me try to give him the, what I was gonna try before, give him the booze.
[151:33.42]Not this?
[151:34.58]Nothing doing.
[151:35.44]No.
[151:38.72]No, I guess it's the guy, someone threw the maze and the boxing glove, the wife and the...
[151:48.84]Where to, Sam?
[151:52.82]Can I just go home?
[151:53.54]Let me talk to him.
[151:56.06]Because I did place it.
[151:57.28]Oh, that was a big one.
[151:59.50]I'm going to do it.
[152:00.58]I'll jump, I tell you.
[152:01.88]Hang on a second, Jimmy.
[152:05.77]Smile, Jimmy.
[152:06.99]What about smile, Jimmy?
[152:09.89]What is it?
[152:10.33]Look on the...
[152:12.00]Turn that frown upside down.
[152:13.88]That nonsense ain't helping.
[152:16.06]Sorry, Jimmy.
[152:16.96]It's just that suicide is too horrible for me to even contemplate.
[152:20.62]Even though we'd all be happier if you were dead.
[152:24.11]So there's no, like, what about your wife?
[152:26.37]No wife, no family, no job.
[152:28.91]What right side?
[152:30.55]Well, with all the brain damage you got from boxing, you'd make a great bacon-eyed janitor.
[152:35.41]Ah, nuts.
[152:36.61]My boxing career didn't even last long enough to give me a decent case of brain damage.
[152:42.79]You know, your wife's gonna give you hell if you kill yourself.
[152:45.65]Mary, she left me!
[152:48.15]You're overreacting, Jimmy.
[152:49.75]You think?
[152:50.85]Sure.
[152:51.41]Your wife probably never really loved you in the first place.
[152:55.36]I gotta get the glove.
[152:56.68]We're in a paradox.
[152:57.54]I have to get the glove to give him a pass so he boxes, but I need to keep the wife there so he doesn't end up going down the path.
[153:05.32]Max, I don't think this is helping.
[153:06.90]I disagree.
[153:09.45]We gotta break the loop here.
[153:12.55]How do I get his wife to... Hmm.
[153:19.90]What is the point of the trap?
[153:20.94]Hold on.
[153:21.16]Am I missing something here?
[153:40.74]Because the present... The trap has said I have this alcohol.
[153:45.52]I have a snowball.
[153:49.81]The family is just out there.
[153:53.19]How do I get the wife to go into the maze?
[153:59.15]Can't take anything from that.
[154:00.05]Alright, hold on.
[154:01.97]Let's go back in here.
[154:14.76]Let's exhaust some options in here.
[154:22.98]Whee!
[154:24.42]Our penny-conscious, tape-eating VCR.
[154:26.86]Jimmy, stop sitting around and get that glove!
[154:32.25]She's talking.
[154:37.29]Take the coat- it's always the coat hanger.
[154:38.55]I'd better not touch it, lest I create an alternate future where coat hangers rule the world.
[154:46.86]Jimmy, if you don't turn off your TV, I'm going to... Hey, where am I?
[154:51.76]Is that really it?
[154:52.76]It's hopeless.
[154:53.90]There's no way out.
[154:55.98]What?
[154:56.74]That is... Don't say that, Mary.
[154:59.66]We can work it out.
[155:00.90]I... I just took his wife.
[155:03.43]She left me.
[155:04.99]Now I'll never see her again.
[155:07.39]That... I know, son.
[155:10.35]I know.
[155:14.13]uh okay so now we go to the present we should put the wife down we show him the we let the wife out let okay I guess we're just gonna hold her up and be like here she is where to sam
[155:45.46]No, yeah, this is how she left.
[155:47.32]Oh shit.
[155:50.39]I told you this is time travel.
[155:57.49]We took her!
[156:05.18]Oh wow.
[156:07.90]Okay, here we go.
[156:09.86]Look!
[156:13.99]Jimmy?
[156:15.09]Jimmy, what are you doing?
[156:16.92]Mary?
[156:18.10]Mary, is that you?
[156:19.74]Mary!
[156:21.03]Don't go anywhere.
[156:22.97]I'll be right down.
[156:24.65]No, Jimmy.
[156:25.75]Don't do it.
[156:27.21]Oh, I thought you were going to jump.
[156:31.18]What?
[156:32.26]Don't talk crazy.
[156:32.92]I hope he takes the glove off and it's a huge fucking human hand.
[156:35.56]Especially not with my best girl here.
[156:38.84]Gee, Sam.
[156:39.98]I think I got something in my eye.
[156:42.00]Don't pick at it, Max.
[156:43.24]It's too hard to get back in the socket.
[156:45.18]Jimmy, I don't know how I got here, but I'm sorry for all the things I said.
[156:50.99]Don't worry, baby.
[156:52.49]Got it.
[156:52.81]Now that you're back in my life, nothing can stop me now.
[156:56.71]I'm unbeatable.
[156:57.97]Thanks for the gloves, Jimmy.
[157:00.99]What?
[157:01.97]Oh, my god.
[157:02.81]That was awful.
[157:07.51]Why did you do that?
[157:12.66]Where to, Sam?
[157:15.13]Give him the glove.
[157:15.73]Why not, yeah.
[157:16.38]Let's go.
[157:16.60]Here you go.
[157:42.60]now be the best boxer ever and then we're gonna lose to him probably not this is probably just as simple as clicking on you and then we win excuse me makes get out of the way thank you makes happy holidays Jimmy hey who true that what could it be true
[158:01.32]Stop that!
[158:20.33]You gotta get me banned.
[158:24.39]No swears are allowed on Twitch.
[158:26.15]The rats made you and the rats will destroy you.
[158:48.90]Sam and Max, you made up for your past and helped Jimmy find your grave.
[158:54.20]Now, for your reward.
[158:56.30]Your Eternal Reward.
[158:58.72]I'm just gonna chill in this bottle until you're ready to unleash all three of us cats on that fascist demon.
[159:05.84]Sally!
[159:07.04]Nope.
[159:13.50]Okay, so we have done that.
[159:15.78]We now have one spirit in the bottle.
[159:18.56]We now have to figure out this shit.
[159:21.08]Which is, we've got the future, which is just standing there.
[159:27.18]That didn't really do anything for us.
[159:29.39]That just closed up that part of the present.
[159:34.01]Let's go back to the future.
[159:34.97]Let's see.
[159:39.53]Ready to hit the future again, Max?
[159:41.49]Go ahead without me.
[159:42.67]I'll catch up.
[159:43.65]Just get in here.
[159:50.21]Bottle of spirits.
[159:50.93]I get it because alcohol is scary.
[159:52.27]Why are you capsing me right now?
[159:53.21]We still haven't escaped yet?
[159:55.21]I'm disappointed.
[159:56.57]It's people like us that give people like us a bad name.
[160:03.55]There's nothing else in here.
[160:06.31]Jimmy didn't do something different.
[160:14.51]I'd better start dieting now if I want to be in shape for my inevitable death.
[160:17.85]Can I throw a snowball at myself?
[160:20.95]Hey there, sexy!
[160:22.23]I'll be back to pick you up later!
[160:27.75]Being hit with a bleached snowball... Nooo.
[160:33.77]Being hit with a... Nooo.
[160:38.81]I don't think I can do anything.
[160:39.73]I need an item or something.
[160:43.76]What happens if you kill yourself in the future?
[160:45.28]Nothing.
[160:45.56]Skipping text?
[160:46.22]I'm skipping the text we've heard three times already.
[160:52.60]Are you mad that you don't get to hear that an eighth time?
[161:13.75]What do you mean I didn't hear that one?
[161:14.71]Yeah, I did.
[161:15.07]Skipping, but it was the shooting one.
[161:27.79]Oh, well, whatever.
[161:30.90]Santa's coal-powered sleigh.
[161:34.32]Santa's coal- We need coal?
[161:39.34]It's running low on coal.
[161:40.56]I need coal.
[161:44.26]Can I dump this guy's energy in here?
[161:48.66]Coal?
[161:51.09]Where do I get coal?
[161:51.91]I gotta get from the stockings.
[161:57.73]Wait a minute.
[161:58.07]Get out of my way.
[161:58.57]Let me go over here.
[162:13.12]So you're telling me this was for nothing?
[162:16.88]This trampoline, cannon, toy bomber thing I don't have to even use right now?
[162:21.40]It was for nothing.
[162:25.44]They set this up- I took like 30 to 40 minutes in the beginning of this stream trying to figure out how to do this.
[162:33.68]I can't be right.
[162:39.01]It was just for fun.
[162:39.87]Whatever, okay.
[162:40.97]That's cool.
[162:43.04]Alright, where is it?
[162:44.18]Stocking stuffer.
[162:45.58]There goes a stocking stuffer.
[162:49.60]There goes a sock.
[162:54.74]So we have to get a pair of socks.
[162:58.92]Where can I get socks?
[163:02.86]I need a pair of socks!
[163:06.24]Santa doesn't have a socks liner on him somewhere?
[163:11.90]Okay.
[163:20.54]Are the... Curly Larry and Moe still out there, whatever they are?
[163:24.32]No, no socks here.
[163:28.00]No.
[163:52.56]Are these little weirdos over here still?
[163:54.22]No, they're gone.
[163:56.84]Socks.
[163:58.55]We're going to get a pair of socks.
[164:09.67]Off topic, but how much... Never mind.
[164:12.54]That's very off topic.
[164:13.60]That's so off topic.
[164:14.48]That's not even... I never would read that.
[164:18.28]Okay.
[164:19.26]Just what we need.
[164:27.45]I mean, there was a feet command here.
[164:29.77]Hey, Stinky.
[164:30.71]Oh, she can't hear us.
[164:32.54]No, it's in the other... No, I gotta go back.
[164:34.10]No, not a cover.
[164:41.48]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[164:42.68]That's the only... Is she even wearing socks?
[164:48.57]Why would I go to the... Why would I go up there and be like, Hey, uh... Can I have your socks?
[164:58.34]Uh, no.
[165:04.07]They're for a quest!
[165:07.17]Okay.
[165:08.79]Hold on.
[165:29.38]Is that really what it is?

[166:52.26]No, not really.
[166:53.40]It was our toughest battle yet.
[166:54.94]We secured our positions in a heavily fortified dumpster when suddenly they came out of nowhere.
[167:01.00]Who?
[167:01.90]The cleaning crew.
[167:03.70]Cleaning crew.
[167:05.50]Attacking with sanitation.

[167:11.24]I think I'm getting baited.
[167:13.36]I still remember his last words.

[167:19.96]God, he was concise.
[167:22.35]Cleaning.

[167:25.73]I know what to do.
[167:34.53]Can't you get your family to leave?
[167:36.77]This sorry regiment never listens to me.
[167:39.47]These half-woods would only listen to my father.
[167:41.69]God rest his exoskeleton.
[167:45.39]Goodbye.
[167:46.22]Keep him down.
[167:49.66]No.
[167:49.72]That was so clever.
[167:50.42]Really?
[167:50.80]No.
[167:50.86]No.
[167:51.00]That's not it?
[167:51.86]Where's the watering can?
[168:18.21]Can I throw it at a different time period?

[169:22.28]Get over it.
[169:48.76]I must admit your repentance was... acceptable.
[169:53.38]I suppose I can help you after all.
[169:56.05]Forget that!
[169:57.01]You gotta send me back!
[169:58.37]I wasn't done haunting people yet!

[173:21.33]Joke's on you.
[173:21.89]The chat wasn't being creepy.
[173:24.11]Well, they were.
[173:25.23]Very much so.
[173:26.86]But I thought I was getting... I thought it was like a defeat meme on Twitch.
[173:31.22]Apparently not.
[173:33.46]I was trying so hard to think of another solution around that.
[173:41.49]But it actually was the solution.
[173:43.27]Because I thought everybody was just doing like...
[173:53.71]this way that's gonna be like on the counter that footbath was heavenly my feet haven't felt that good since that hot oil massage from barack obama it smells like you've got a new item on the menu too now I can find the strength to keep serving these poor sweet spoiled imbeciles
[174:22.34]This smelly old sock could come in handy.
[174:44.27]That was the thing that I thought was never gonna happen because everyone was saying it was gonna happen.
[174:49.55]I was trying to just subvert it so much See you guys
[175:17.99]Chad is becoming the voice in Jerma's head that is always right that he never believes.
[175:32.31]Always right, okay.
[175:36.39]Hang back on the extreme back pat there.
[175:40.94]Always right.
[175:45.77]Let's see what Stinky's getting from Santa this year.
[175:52.47]It's full of coal.
[175:53.65]That's what you get for lying all the time.
[175:55.95]What do you think you get for reckless disregard for public safety?
[175:59.50]In my case, I got to be president.
[176:03.04]At least one guy is right in chat at all times.
[176:07.24]Yeah, I mean, that's... But you're just talking about, like, a sample, like, statistic here.
[176:13.00]There's 3,000 people here.
[176:16.30]Somebody's gonna be right.
[176:17.80]At least ten of you, a hundred of you maybe.
[176:23.62]What do you mean?
[176:25.38]If you get a thousand people in a room and you ask them all a hard question, at least a dozen of them will get it right.
[176:34.03]So chat is- No, some of chat is always right.
[176:37.13]Most of chat is always wrong.
[176:46.83]That's true!
[176:48.55]Some of chat is right, and most of chat is wrong.
[176:52.29]Right?
[176:55.93]I'm not... think about how many times you've said something that it was correct.
[177:00.26]You're one of like the 20-30% that gets it right.
[177:03.36]I was thinking we could use it to save our future selves.
[177:05.96]Right!
[177:06.54]In a preemptive strike against the vengeful Kiwis!
[177:10.45]Get in the slate, buckethead.
[177:18.72]We need more research for that conclusion.
[177:21.60]by the ruby red goiters of Rube Goldberg.
[177:23.90]Look, Max, it's Santa's sleigh.
[177:25.96]What an unexpected stroke of luck.
[177:28.24]Is this another mastermind thing?
[177:29.86]Remember that time long ago when Jack and Santa swore in an effort to save Christmas and drove it recklessly into a hellish vision of the future very much like the one we're standing in now?
[177:38.70]I stopped paying attention halfway through that sentence.
[177:41.54]I wonder if our ghosts are here guiding us right now.
[177:44.48]Hey, past me!
[177:46.10]Check this out!
[177:47.58]Shake that thing!
[177:49.18]Classy as always, little pal.
[177:51.23]We did it.
[177:55.95]I have closed all outlying portals.
[178:01.97]Hey, you could stand to lose a few yourself, smart guy.
[178:09.78]Chat is always right.
[178:13.36]Right, if you could say that.
[178:14.16]Well, we saved Christmas for our future selves.
[178:16.40]Chat collectively, some of them would be right, so chat would be right.
[178:21.33]But that's not how it works.
[178:22.39]But that would also make Chat wrong, too.
[178:23.77]Yes.
[178:23.85]Chat is right and wrong at the same time.
[178:45.39]By the way, opinions are not facts.
[178:47.17]Let's just get that.
[178:47.69]So, Jerma is short.
[178:48.77]Oh, we can all agree on that.
[178:50.43]That's an opinion of yours.
[178:52.75]If somebody was like 5'5", or like 5'2", I would be taller than them and they wouldn't think I was short.
[179:01.61]So, that's an... Somebody... If I went to like a village of people that were like 2 feet tall at some point, I don't know, I would be tall.
[179:10.91]That would be their opinion.
[179:11.59]Oh, you're kind of tall.
[179:13.89]So, that's an opinion of yours.
[179:15.53]That's not a fact.
[179:21.61]So I have all the Christmas Spirits.
[179:26.01]Uh... Barbed wire.
[179:36.94]So, with the... I was supposed to take the Spirits and... What was I supposed to do with them?
[179:41.68]Give them to Santa?
[179:45.34]What are you doing?
[179:45.90]I just, we were talking about, I got, I got... We were talking about shitting.
[179:50.63]What are you doing in the game?
[179:51.77]Yeah, we were talking, I wasn't like, I was focusing on speaking about opinions.
[180:14.11]What size shoe do you wear?
[180:16.37]14.
[180:17.29]Bummer.
[180:18.19]Well, we tried.
[180:19.11]Get it.
[180:29.76]Santa, you can come down now, man.
[180:32.27]That's about it for us.
[180:33.89]Happy New Year, everybody.
[180:37.71]Well, I hope you boys have learned your lesson.
[180:41.11]No, I got a size 10.
[180:41.89]Uh oh.
[181:11.37]So wait that was all for nothing the whole episode was for no reason
[181:43.39]Alright, this is where it comes into play here.
[181:49.23]Okay.
[181:50.21]Yep.
[181:53.30]We planned for this.
[181:55.34]So, we've got to move this over there.
[182:01.52]And then we've got to move this...
[182:05.48]We've got to move that.
[182:07.86]Shoot that.
[182:08.82]Drop it on his head.
[182:09.72]Trampoline.
[182:11.16]We've got to... We've got to get that.
[182:14.94]We've got to move this.
[182:16.70]Over here.
[182:18.02]Stop it over the trampoline.
[182:21.86]And then shoot it with a cannon.
[182:24.48]And the cannon's going to break that.
[182:25.58]It's going to bounce and hit him in the head.
[182:27.06]No, it's not.
[182:28.06]What we've got to do here is we've got to shoot this.
[182:31.15]Shoot the...
[182:34.88]How do I move the cannon?
[182:45.15]Gift.
[182:45.65]Christmas present.
[182:47.83]We've got to shoot.
[182:50.57]Oops.
[182:52.83]Shoot the present.
[182:53.77]On to the trampoline.
[182:56.14]Oh, fuck.
[182:57.98]Shoot the cannon.
[183:00.06]Shoot the present.
[183:00.88]Present explodes.
[183:06.59]Shoot the cannon.
[183:07.79]Hits the present.
[183:09.43]Present onto the back board.
[183:12.71]Back board.
[183:14.73]Goes over here.
[183:17.63]Dump it.
[183:17.99]Yeah, we finally did it!
[183:34.64]Why won't you guys just die?
[183:36.50]Now it's time we sent this demon back where he belongs.
[183:40.53]Under an unsuspecting child's bed?
[183:42.49]No, look at the mailing label.
[183:45.71]Somebody messed up.
[183:47.37]It wasn't supposed to go to Santa.
[183:50.00]It was supposed to go to Satan.
[183:57.32]Everybody, it's almost dawn.
[183:59.48]What are you standing around for?
[184:04.49]Wasn't a Jerma joke?
[184:06.91]No, it wasn't.
[184:07.85]When have I ever done like a change the letters around joke to make another word?
[184:11.94]That's never happened.
[184:12.82]It's an opinion, not a fact.
[184:14.46]So that was the Christmas episode.
[184:35.42]Oh.
[184:35.60]Ice Station Santa.
[184:36.74]He was the most unholy creature that was ever born.
[185:05.56]Cool.
[185:06.32]That was fun.
[185:07.16]We're gonna take a pee break while the ending plays out, and then we're gonna go into episode two.
[185:16.81]Next episode when?
[185:17.81]Right now.
[185:19.11]You're about to see it.
[185:19.63]Alright, I'll be right back.
[185:30.75]This will just play out.
[185:32.59]See you in like two or three minutes.
[185:39.12]Thank you.
[186:33.78]Thank you.
[188:42.23]Why is it taking so long to pee?
[188:43.85]But I gotta get water too.
[188:45.07]Come on, I gotta pee, I gotta get water, I gotta like stand up and shake around and move around a little.
[188:57.64]Takes a few minutes.
[188:59.68]Everyone always screams, you're not hydrating enough.
[189:02.84]You're gonna die.
[189:04.62]Where the fuck is he?
[189:05.34]Get back here now.
[189:07.36]I was gonna get a water.
[189:08.32]No, no.
[189:09.64]Now.
[189:11.00]Okay.
[189:13.84]Drink some water, for God's sakes.
[189:15.66]You're shriveling up.
[189:22.02]Sorry.
[189:22.48]Alright.
[189:25.36]Let's do episode two.
[189:35.15]You guys are like a grandma.
[189:38.34]Dear, dear, please come in.
[189:42.51]Look at you.
[189:43.29]You haven't eaten in forever.
[189:44.69]Get in here.
[189:45.51]Want some cookies?
[189:47.69]Oh, yes, you love cookies.
[189:49.51]Have a steak, too.
[189:50.66]Grandma will take care of you.
[189:52.68]You know, you look a little fat today.
[189:55.88]You should go outside more often and get some exercise.
[190:11.95]There's the Adam Sandler voice again.
[190:15.87]That's probably an Adam Sandler joke.
[190:19.07]I definitely didn't make that up.
[190:20.27]Somebody else did.
[190:21.95]That's been a thing for a long time.
[190:24.12]Adam Sandler probably made that up too.
[190:35.62]Adam Sandler was funny.
[190:38.03]You know, before he started doing a Netflix movie every three months.
[190:42.77]He was funny like 10, 20 years ago.
[190:45.17]What do you mean he wasn't funny ever?
[190:54.84]He was funny on Saturday Night Live.
[190:59.52]Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, those movies were actually pretty funny.
[191:07.11]Just because his movies are not good now...
[191:17.30]His mid to late 90s movies were pretty good.
[191:29.17]That was like the heyday.
[191:31.20]Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, Dana Carvey, David Spade, Chris Rock.
[191:40.86]Come on.
[191:42.61]That was like the golden years.
[191:47.81]all not particularly funny people holy I'm too old for this who's funny now who who would you compare to Chris rock that's funnier now somebody ninja
[192:23.48]Bill Burr is hilarious, but Bill Burr has also been around for a long time.
[192:34.77]Alright.
[192:35.45]Okay, before I have a meltdown.
[192:56.50]Anyone you don't like.
[192:58.00]Alright, let me, uh... Okay, here we go.
[193:05.73]Quit this!
[193:07.17]Episode 2.
[193:08.73]Give me a moment, it's actually kind of... Opening these old games, they require a lot of care and attention.
[193:16.13]So I'm gonna mute the audio so I don't hurt anybody.
[193:23.06]I have to change the title, too, to make it Episode 2.
[193:27.22]Which is, uh, Moy Better Blues.
[193:31.63]Here we go.
[193:31.99]I have to do all the settings again.
[193:43.09]Why is it not?
[193:43.49]There we go.
[193:46.81]Do I drink tap water?
[193:49.17]Um, technically, yes.
[193:54.09]I mean, it comes out of the tap.
[193:56.01]I don't drink it right from the tap, though.
[193:58.20]It's filtered.
[194:03.40]Hold on.
[194:03.72]I'm sorry.
[194:04.06]Sorry.
[194:04.32]Wait, wait, wait.
[194:05.26]Pause.
[194:07.26]Okay.
[194:13.18]No, I have a water filter.
[194:14.85]So the tap water goes through the water filter, and then I drank it.
[194:19.25]It's a good filter.
[194:19.81]Don't worry.
[194:22.48]Let's get this on here.
[194:30.11]Ah-ha!
[194:32.73]There we go.
[194:33.25]The audio seems to be okay, though.
[194:40.33]I hope it is.
[194:44.37]That's such an American thing to do?
[194:46.17]To, what, filter your water?
[194:49.09]There's a lot of fucked up shit that is in water.
[194:56.00]How is it American to filter your water?
[195:00.70]The EU stream was yesterday.
[195:03.48]You may have missed it.
[195:04.12]Alright, let me make sure that's all set.
[195:10.52]No, I gotta change the title.
[195:14.10]Episode 202.
[195:14.56]There it is.
[195:17.88]Let me update it.
[195:20.40]Alright, we're officially ready to play Episode 2.
[195:29.00]Hi!
[195:29.08]Who's that?
[195:52.19]What the hell was that all about?
[195:53.29]That's what I said.
[195:54.37]Unless I miss my guess, Sybil's being pursued by some kind of rogue semi-sentient interdimensional portal.
[196:02.57]Help!
[196:07.43]Think we should try to help her?
[196:08.75]Can't think of anything better to do.
[196:10.05]Alright, so at its peak, how much was the Maxis head in United States dollars?
[196:28.45]No matter how many fires we cause, this baby keeps coming around.
[196:31.58]70 to 80 bucks?
[196:32.16]Yeah, and without complaining about it.
[196:33.94]120 bucks?
[196:34.30]Not like all those uppity firefighters.
[196:39.84]Is it still... It's still worth some money, isn't it?
[196:43.23]Do I have to do anything with the robot?
[196:44.55]We were wondering where you'd scampered off to.
[196:47.71]What are you doing just standing there?
[196:49.59]Stop that thing!
[196:50.71]What do you want me to do?
[196:51.33]You already sucked up Big Otis and T-Bone!
[196:56.37]It's some kind of semi-sentient interdimensional portal.
[196:59.15]Okay.
[197:00.81]I don't have any... shoot it?
[197:05.37]When it comes back around, I'm just gonna shoot it.
[197:11.56]Better not.
[197:13.58]Well, that would've stopped it, wouldn't it?
[197:17.54]Um... throw a parking meter.
[197:21.64]Break... make it the water... have water shoot out.
[197:26.91]Okay, what about Bosco's?
[197:39.01]Hey Bosco, what do you know about suddenly appearing interdimensional portals?
[197:43.03]I hear a lot of things.
[197:44.29]What does it look like?
[197:45.35]Three sides, reddish, chasing Sybil.
[197:48.42]Oh, what you've got there is a Bermuda Triangle.
[197:51.62]Of course.
[197:52.68]Why didn't we think of that?
[197:54.26]Wait, chasing Sybil?
[197:55.90]You mean it's here?
[197:57.52]Oh, that ain't good.
[197:58.64]That ain't good at all.
[198:02.03]Shouldn't the Bermuda Triangle be in Bermuda?
[198:04.93]What's the Bermuda Triangle doing all the way up here?
[198:07.64]Sometimes they just like to wander.
[198:10.00]Unless it was summoned by T.H.E.M.
[198:14.86]This thing again.
[198:15.98]Okay.
[198:17.62]Uh, who controls the triangle?
[198:18.90]Who's on the triangle here?
[198:20.04]I told you!
[198:21.26]T-H-E-M!
[198:23.35]I really hope you're talking about the giant ants this time.
[198:26.21]Giant ants?
[198:27.61]That's crazy.
[198:28.91]I'm talking about the mysterious cabal of controllers who summon the triangles as sentient portals to do their dark bidding.
[198:37.23]Well, that makes sense.
[198:38.67]If there's a triangle in our neighborhood, that means they're coming!
[198:43.98]Alright.
[198:45.94]Um, how do we stop this triangle?
[198:48.26]Okay.
[198:58.82]How do we communicate with the triangle?
[199:00.64]They're very attracted to symbols and sigils.
[199:03.82]Symbols and sigils.
[199:05.58]Those two, they're not real picky.
[199:08.29]They're driven by shapes and colors.
[199:10.71]A pink rhombus makes it nostalgic for the 50s.
[199:13.97]A red octagon makes it stop whatever it's doing.
[199:16.91]A blue icosahedron makes it sit in its mom's basement and draw maps of dungeons.
[199:22.79]And they can't see or hear.
[199:24.53]So you've got to feed them a symbol of what you want them to do.
[199:27.84]Okay, so we need an octagon.
[199:29.14]That sounds pretty good.
[199:33.20]Some of these comedy foods I would love to eat.
[200:00.85]When your life is such a joke that you want to eat comedy food.
[200:29.47]what like you like you didn't like you've never wanted to have like a donut from The Simpsons like specifically from The Simpsons come on donuts are real that's a real food though oh yeah um what about a uh everlasting gobstopper
[201:02.08]Those aren't real.
[201:04.18]That's a fucking comedy food.
[201:09.14]Those are real.
[201:09.70]No, they're not.
[201:12.88]Those aren't real.
[201:14.15]Wonka was bought out by one company, and they, uh, they do, they still, only thing they do is nerds.
[201:21.79]They don't do anything else anymore.
[201:22.73]They don't have, like, Wonka bars anymore.
[201:24.07]They don't... The Wonka the company went under.
[201:29.10]They don't really exist anymore.
[201:32.42]Look it up.
[201:33.78]Why does the Bermuda Triangle have such a grudge against all those boats and planes?
[201:37.66]Oh, the Triangle got a bad rap for that.
[201:40.06]Scientists say those accidents were caused by sudden explosive outbursts of methane gas.
[201:46.65]Speaking of which... Max, don't.
[201:49.53]What Sam?
[201:50.51]I was going to point out that many phenomena long believed to have paranormal causes have actually turned out to be far more mundane in origin.
[201:57.41]Only one phenomenon's tremendous power continues to baffle scientists and defy rational explanation.
[202:02.54]Why do you always bring negative energy?
[202:04.62]What's that?
[202:17.79]Alright, so we need to get out of here.
[202:19.57]I'm gonna get a red... I'm gonna get Octagon.
[202:25.46]I wasn't laughing at that, I was laughing at something that somebody said.
[202:48.04]Alright.
[202:52.76]We need... Let's go over here.
[202:59.47]Into Stinkys.
[203:00.47]What about the toys?
[203:08.84]How does it feel knowing you're the only person on Twitch streaming this game?
[203:16.35]Doesn't surprise me.
[203:18.03]Alright, so we have to stop this.
[203:21.39]We need an octagon.
[203:22.11]Can we go into Sybil's?
[203:23.01]Sybil's office is closed.
[203:23.83]Number one, Sam and Max.
[203:24.73]Screamer.
[203:26.33]Streamer.
[203:48.66]Oh, damn it.
[203:49.68]Stupid spot.
[203:50.80]Red.
[203:52.24]Oh, it's you guys.
[203:53.62]Hank and Jethro, was it?
[203:55.14]Red, toaster.
[203:57.01]What are you doing?
[203:58.11]What?
[203:58.47]I was just taking care of some cleaning.
[204:01.99]If that's a blood stain, you should be sure to use bleach.
[204:06.66]I don't know what you're talking about.
[204:16.53]Sadly, I think my days of pillaging coastal villages are now behind me.
[204:28.07]Gimme.
[204:28.47]Gimme.
[204:28.61]I got it.
[204:29.06]I win.
[204:29.20]Can we borrow your sign, Stinky?
[204:30.48]It's kind of important.
[204:31.90]Well, okay.
[204:33.02]But bring it back.
[204:33.96]It's a national heirloom.
[204:35.20]He made an octagon!
[204:35.84]That's the stop sign that would have prevented the Kennedy assassination if Connolly hadn't run it.
[204:41.04]He's blind.
[204:41.70]What?
[204:41.91]Yeah, they can't do everything instantly.
[204:47.29]Oh, my god.
[204:48.21]I need to instantly do it in a second.
[204:57.11]Look, Max.
[204:57.69]It's our neighbor, Flint Paper.
[204:59.43]Hiya, fellas.
[205:00.47]Keep it on the down low, would you?
[205:02.54]I'm doing surveillance.
[205:04.44]Oh, boy.
[205:05.20]Real detective work.
[205:06.78]Who are you spying on?
[205:08.32]Some mug named Bosco.
[205:11.45]Oh, so... Wait, is this... Somebody's... Okay.
[205:15.53]Stinkies has a no smoking unless you're Flint policy.
[205:18.51]Sounds a lot like their policy on homicides.
[205:23.51]Kitty litter.
[205:24.37]Somebody gave a lot of money.
[205:27.46]A ball of koala, 50 bucks.
[205:28.90]Thank you for the $50.
[205:30.46]5,000 bits.
[205:31.52]5,000 bits.
[205:32.40]Thank you.
[205:34.20]A ball of koala.
[205:36.40]Huge cast drop.
[205:39.23]bit explosion there and they say don't listen to chat they suck um thank you for the 50 dollars I mean that's I don't have any quarters your opinion no problem the jukebox only takes 20s that's your opinion but like come here for a second
[206:08.61]Yeah, yeah, no, come here.
[206:09.91]Yep.
[206:11.73]Fuck, you nailed it, man.
[206:13.39]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[206:13.83]No, they can't hear us.
[206:16.58]That was fucking hilarious.
[206:18.10]Of course that's what I fucking think.
[206:20.06]Get the fuck out of here, man.
[206:21.12]Fucking thank you for that.
[206:24.49]Thanks for coming out.
[206:24.97]See you later.
[206:27.99]Uh, hey!
[206:39.12]There we go.
[206:41.62]Now, thanks for the 50 bucks.
[206:43.56]I just wanted to say thanks in person.
[206:45.60]A little, you know, bring him up and just huddle up a little bit and just... You know, like what dad does at the wedding when he leans in and says... I just wanted to tell him a couple things.
[206:54.33]I appreciated that.
[206:58.83]Alright, so we have... Let's go stop it.
[207:15.99]What are you talking about?
[207:21.76]I just had a moment with somebody.
[207:23.18]Come on.
[207:23.62]Come on.
[207:29.64]Cross over here so I can stop you.
[207:45.27]Got it.
[207:51.17]Oh, it stopped.
[207:54.13]Well, there's another case solved.
[207:56.13]I heard screaming.
[207:57.41]Are you alright?
[207:58.09]Don't suck up Abe Lincoln's head.
[207:59.99]Whoa.
[208:00.83]What's happening?
[208:02.47]No.
[208:02.99]I regret the pain.
[208:05.94]No, not Abe Lincoln.
[208:06.90]Abe, no.
[208:08.08]Be strong, my marble darling.
[208:10.30]I'll save you.
[208:13.81]As I was saying, there's another case solved.
[208:16.99]And with minimal casualties.
[208:19.05]What do you think's on the other side, Sam?
[208:21.45]Oh, I don't know.
[208:22.31]Probably some horrible alternate dimension ruled by incomprehensibly horrific ancient gods seeking to bring chaos to this plane.
[208:28.80]You want to jump in?
[208:30.08]You can read my mind, Sam.
[208:31.34]Ooh, we're going a new dimension.
[208:32.54]I hope not.
[208:40.26]Ooh.
[208:41.88]It's my opportunity.
[208:42.50]I can do it.
[208:44.74]Yeah.
[208:45.04]Yeah.
[209:16.63]More tropical than I imagined a horrific alternate dimension to be.
[209:20.10]Help!
[209:21.56]Help me!
[209:23.56]Help!
[209:24.82]Oh, you big baby.
[209:26.43]But my nose sunburns so easily.
[209:30.89]I'll get it for you later.
[209:33.09]Oh, hi, Sam and Max.
[209:35.13]Are you guys on vacation too?
[209:36.71]Yeah, vacation.
[209:38.13]We came here to rescue you from unimaginable horrors beyond the portal of mystery.
[209:42.19]You could have at least had the courtesy to be impaled on spikes or something.
[209:46.07]Have to do it next episode.
[209:48.85]Well, thanks for the thought, guys.
[209:50.79]But this place is great.
[209:52.75]What was the name of it again?
[209:54.00]Rabanui?
[209:55.98]What scab are you guys eating in that pot?
[210:00.36]Commonly known as Easter Island.
[210:02.30]Because once you leave, three days later you can't wait to come back.
[210:05.98]Abe and I thought this would be a great chance to get some alone time.
[210:10.39]Emphasis on alone.
[210:12.51]Ah, finally.
[210:14.39]Someone has come to rescue us from the ancient prophecy.
[210:18.29]Oh, they talk?
[210:21.07]Uh-oh, Sam.
[210:22.19]Ancient prophecies can only mean two things.
[210:24.82]Tedious backstories and work we don't get paid for.
[210:28.26]Let's hear them out, little buddy.
[210:29.90]Well, alright.
[210:31.00]Maybe these giant stone heads have something interesting to say.
[210:34.42]Big stone heads.
[210:35.68]What's all this about a prophecy?
[210:37.62]The ancient ones said this was going to happen.
[210:41.04]It's the end of our civilization.
[210:43.96]But you can stop the prophecy and save us all.
[210:48.70]Wonderful.
[210:50.09]Okay.
[210:52.00]What is the prophecy?
[210:53.00]What exactly does this prophecy say is going to happen?
[210:55.98]The Carvers foretold a golden age of one thousand years of peace.
[211:02.19]and then a terrible cataclysm.
[211:06.25]The great volcano god Ranakau would reawaken and rain fiery death upon the island.
[211:13.58]Our noble civilization would come to an end.
[211:17.90]Hot damn!
[211:19.24]Sounds like we picked the coolest time to come.
[211:23.10]What do you want us to do?
[211:24.34]You must stop Ronakau from erupting and destroying us all.
[211:28.22]Stop Ronakau from erupting.
[211:30.66]Legend speak of a hidden cave beneath the island where the ancient carvers built a means to pacify the volcano god.
[211:39.59]In the mood for a little spelunking and volcano god pacifying, little buddy?
[211:43.75]If by pacifying you mean squeezing the magma out of him like toothpaste from a savagely beaten tube, and by spelunking you mean spelunking, then yes!
[211:54.13]Okay, we'll do it.
[211:54.91]Okay.
[211:55.17]Not even a couple of bits?
[212:15.41]Anything else in that prophecy?
[212:16.43]Who are you guys?
[212:17.43]Who are you guys, anyway?
[212:18.67]Okay.
[212:44.53]So where's the cave?
[212:45.53]Where is this ancient hidden underground cave?
[212:48.11]It's hidden.
[212:48.97]Cool it, Rocky.
[212:49.95]We were asking the middle one.
[212:51.65]Unfortunately, he is correct.
[212:54.09]The entrance to the cave is shrouded in mystery.
[212:56.71]It's going to be in one of their mouths.
[212:58.03]The path is fraught with peril.
[213:00.83]Fraught with peril or just rife with peril?
[213:04.07]This is the kind of thing we need to know going in.
[213:06.48]It doesn't matter.
[213:07.22]You'll never find it.
[213:08.02]Okay.
[213:10.92]Cheer up.
[213:11.68]Max and I will find a way to stop that volcano.
[213:14.18]Oh, good.
[213:15.18]Then we'll be able to go back to our important work of sitting motionless and staring.
[213:21.00]At least we have something to look forward to.
[213:24.64]That's a really, really good Queen of Thorns impression.
[213:31.69]I feel like the Queen of Thorns.
[213:32.49]I feel like I'm watching Game of Thrones.
[213:42.27]Portal, triangle, triangle.
[213:46.87]Gone.
[213:48.33]And lost and found.
[213:51.09]They don't want to be known as... That's not a joke.
[213:53.47]I just think that that sounds just like... Diana Rigg.
[213:55.62]Okay.
[214:15.30]Fountain of Youth.
[214:17.84]Gong, life preserver.
[214:19.12]Alright, so we have to use that.
[214:20.02]Get rid of the piranhas.
[214:45.38]Somehow.
[214:45.88]Triangle, gong.
[214:47.48]What are these?
[214:55.15]It's even the same color scheme as portal.
[214:57.63]When did this come out?
[214:58.13]Alright, so...
[215:19.37]So this is the portal out.
[215:20.29]Anything else in here?
[215:20.95]There's the picnic.
[215:21.53]They're doing a picnic over here.
[215:24.79]A gong.
[215:25.25]There's gongs all over the place.
[215:26.57]It's a silver gong.
[215:30.01]Hello, we're Sam and Max, freelance police.
[215:32.01]Bro, the cake is a lie.
[215:33.71]I'm the guardian of the stone.
[215:36.45]I can do this one.
[215:37.05]What was that?
[215:38.23]I can't understand you.
[215:41.45]I'm the guardian of the stone.
[215:44.27]Still can't understand you.
[215:45.79]Speak a little more clearly.
[215:48.02]I'm Sam.
[215:58.68]What's left of Noah's Ark?
[216:00.26]So the legends are true.
[216:02.05]Someone really was crazy enough to save mosquitoes from extinction.
[216:06.11]And humans.
[216:07.29]Live and learn.
[216:09.79]Nowhere to go.
[216:11.63]How did you find picnic stuff on a desolate island?
[216:14.62]Easy.
[216:15.16]It was all in the picnic basket.
[216:19.14]See, I drank all the coffee out of this coffee mug.
[216:22.40]It's been sitting here empty with just a little coffee stain on the bottom.
[216:28.41]This smells so bad.
[216:30.85]I don't know why.
[216:32.87]When coffee dries out... That's why I never spill coffee in your fucking car.
[216:38.07]When coffee dries, it smells like shit.
[216:43.06]Like actual shit.
[216:46.65]I remember one time my mother dumped a whole coffee in the car accidentally.
[216:49.65]And it smelled like an ass for five years.
[216:54.95]But something tells me this just might be the ancient entrance to the secret underground lair of the volcano god.
[217:00.78]Where do you two think you're going?
[217:03.02]Oh, Sam, he's got a little gun.
[217:05.02]Isn't he the cutest thing?
[217:07.14]Can we keep him?
[217:08.24]Try not to get imprinted or shot, Max.
[217:10.74]We still don't know who this little type belongs to.
[217:13.24]Jimmy Hoffa belongs to nobody.
[217:17.48]Uh... Okay, so... You can't be Jimmy Hoffa.
[217:23.14]Jimmy Hoffa was a ruthless union organizer and head of the Teamsters in the 50s and 60s, known for his ties to organized crime and his mysterious disappearance.
[217:31.43]Good recap, Sam.
[217:32.93]Also, Jimmy Hoffa wasn't a diaper-wearing baby.
[217:36.19]I'm not a baby!
[217:37.57]Look at the way his little thumb pulls back the hammer!
[217:41.25]He's adorable!
[217:43.05]People always showing me disrespect.
[217:46.01]I should never have started drinking from that fountain of youth.
[217:49.43]No, that makes sense.
[217:51.79]What fountain of youth are you talking about?
[217:53.44]Are we going to be babies?
[217:54.10]That fountain right there, brainiac.
[217:57.52]You expect us to believe the fountain of youth is on Easter Island?
[218:01.10]I can't believe it.
[218:02.00]I can't believe how perfect he is.
[218:06.06]Okay.
[218:06.93]So you came here for the fountain.
[218:08.35]A little bit.
[218:08.67]A little bit.
[218:23.03]Well, why did you drink so much of it?
[218:25.05]Just take a small sip every day and stay the same age.
[218:28.58]You know?
[218:29.02]Well, just put an eye droplet in there and drop one droplet into your eye.
[218:34.50]And you'll stay, like, 40.
[218:35.12]Forever.
[218:57.80]I don't see where the big deal is.
[218:59.62]Step aside, sport.
[219:00.92]We grown-ups have to take care of a great big mean old volcano god.
[219:04.69]You and your companion will be wanting to take a step back.
[219:09.35]Oh, look, he's trying to intimidate us.
[219:11.37]He's just perfect.
[219:13.17]Please let's take him home.
[219:14.83]Not now, Max.
[219:15.93]Then when, Sam?
[219:17.53]My biological clock is ticking and I'm not getting any younger.
[219:25.31]If you spit into the fountain, do you get older?
[219:28.72]No, your spit would.
[219:31.26]Whatever the DNA that's in the saliva would transmute.
[219:35.66]Whatever it does.
[219:38.13]No, it would have to come in contact with you.
[219:41.95]Okay, so we need to obviously... Is baby getting fussy?
[219:47.87]Is it his bedtime?
[219:49.13]I mean, yeah, it gets younger, not older.
[219:51.51]You know what I'm trying to say.
[219:52.35]How can we find out?
[220:00.43]Is baby gassy?
[220:01.75]Does baby need to be burped?
[220:03.31]That's weird to hear that come out of his mouth.
[220:06.08]Is baby gassy?
[220:07.08]That's the first time we've heard, I think, him change the way that he speaks.
[220:13.22]This is very weird.
[220:15.10]We'll give you a nice big rattle for that dumb old gun of yours.
[220:19.60]You two are seriously trying my patience.
[220:22.88]Sam, let's teach him the wrong words for things.
[220:27.87]We're going bye-bye now.
[220:29.33]Bye-bye.
[220:30.43]You'll stay gone if you know what's good for you.
[220:33.41]Sam, look how his little eyes and the barrel of his gun follow us.
[220:36.91]So we need to get him to get out of the way.
[220:40.70]We can't go in.
[220:41.98]Bye-bye.
[220:42.94]So we need to, OK, Tiny Tiki is this way.
[220:52.62]Looks like we've stumbled into some primitive tiki bar.
[220:54.86]What the hell is going on here?
[220:59.10]Alright, so this is called Wipeout.
[221:17.39]Hey Max, want to see how I won all those surfing trophies back at school?
[221:20.93]No, I don't want to see you cry to the PE teacher and then beg me to club your competitors in the knees.
[221:25.41]Why?
[221:26.28]Oh, you're just jealous of my more plausible center of gravity.
[221:29.48]Watch this.
[221:31.76]It's surfing time.
[221:32.48]As the surfboard bucks back and forth, use your mouse or the arrow keys to dodge flying bottles.
[221:37.62]What do you mean arrow keys?
[221:39.24]Like up or down?
[221:45.53]You lost, Sam.
[221:46.61]True surfers don't lose, pal.
[221:48.51]We just bide our time and hop on the next wave.
[221:50.79]I thought I pressed left.
[221:51.73]True surfers don't flail their arms and shriek like startled raccoons either.
[221:55.35]I'm pretty sure you lost.
[221:58.94]Try that again.
[221:59.36]Have your socks knocked off, little pal.
[222:01.14]I don't wear socks, Sam.
[222:02.54]Socks feet.
[222:02.94]Just humor me.
[222:03.64]Socks.
[222:03.94]I feel better pretending that you're not naked.
[222:05.98]Okay.
[222:08.48]No way.
[222:16.41]Hold on, it's not instant.
[222:19.81]The sun was in my eyes.
[222:23.28]I'm gonna take another crack.
[222:32.54]Radical!
[222:35.50]Watch out for flying bottles!
[222:42.95]Why is it doing that?
[222:48.48]So what do I get?
[222:51.10]A baby bottle?
[222:51.92]A baby bottle pop?
[222:53.28]A baby bottle pop?
[222:56.56]I hope so.
[222:57.04]So it was pointless.
[223:00.67]Purely decorative.
[223:05.61]Hiya fellas.
[223:06.65]What brings you to our little slice of Paradise?
[223:09.41]Sam and Max.
[223:10.13]Freelance police, ma'am.
[223:11.72]And we're here to stop a volcano.
[223:13.56]You babies are in danger.
[223:15.30]Shut up.
[223:15.98]We're not babies.
[223:17.30]God.
[223:19.30]He's right.
[223:20.30]Pleased to meet you, boys.
[223:21.66]We're not babies.
[223:23.30]That's Napoleon Dynamite, baby.
[223:25.60]My name's Amelia Earhart.
[223:27.52]You've already met Mr. Charles Lindbergh Jr.
[223:30.20]Whatever.
[223:31.34]And that other fella is one Mr. Dan Cooper.
[223:34.29]Hey, how y'all doing?
[223:35.79]Call me DB.
[223:36.63]Everybody does.
[223:37.67]Did y'all fly out here?
[223:38.95]Woo-hoo!
[223:42.13]You've been missing forever.
[223:43.91]You guys have been missing for decades.
[223:45.83]That's the funny thing about this island.
[223:47.85]It's easy to lose track of time.
[223:49.39]And they just keep drinking baby drinks.
[223:51.07]You had conspiracy theorists and documentary filmmakers.
[223:54.51]Drinks.
[223:54.97]Baby fountain of youth drinks.
[223:56.39]You can't tell us what to do.
[223:59.15]They keep drinking from the fountain of youth.
[224:05.08]You look younger than in your pictures.
[224:07.51]It's that dang fountain.
[224:09.59]Once you start drinking from it, you can't stop.
[224:12.07]We had to put the fountain off limits, or we would have drunk ourselves out of existence.
[224:16.39]Ironic, ain't it?
[224:17.61]I made my reputation being a woman unafraid to wear pants, and now I'm wearing rubber pants.
[224:27.83]Um, it must have been a big adjustment going back to wearing diapers.
[224:31.05]Well, not for me.
[224:32.15]When you're in my line of work, it helps to have some extra protection, if you know what I'm saying.
[224:36.06]Did I ever tell y'all about how I dived them feds and jumped out of a jumbo?
[224:39.62]Only like a million times.
[224:41.44]Okay, what's the do around here?
[224:44.78]What do you guys do for fun around here?
[224:46.42]We used to ride the bucking surfboard until we drank ourselves under the height limit.
[224:50.86]Dang, that son of a bee was a hoot and a half.
[224:53.79]Give me a few more years and I'll beat your record, Amelia.
[224:58.17]Why don't you just leave?
[224:58.85]Why haven't you gone home?
[225:00.33]And ruin a clean getaway?
[225:01.59]Heck no.
[225:02.91]They don't understand me at home.
[225:04.95]My parents are so stupid.
[225:07.75]And I'll make a drink order in 1973.
[225:10.39]I'm not leaving until I get some service.
[225:13.44]Who is this one?
[225:14.28]Who is this guy?
[225:24.18]How'd you manage to all regress to exactly the same age?
[225:27.81]It was a very carefully planned and executed drinking game.
[225:31.53]You take a drink every time DB says the word parachute.
[225:35.74]Okay.
[225:36.86]See you around, kids.
[225:38.80]We have to fill up.
[225:40.45]We have to drink.
[225:41.01]I'm going to get a small max here.
[225:42.99]Oh.
[225:47.55]Okay, hold on a minute.
[225:51.77]If we boil the water from the Fountain of Youth, then it maybe will be the Fountain of Aging.
[225:58.04]Maybe the boiling the water gets rid of the aging germs and... It's cartoon logic, guys.
[226:03.06]It's possible.
[226:04.38]I'm gonna boil the water.
[226:07.44]I'm just gonna reverse them or something.
[226:14.38]Thank you.
[226:14.76]Thank you!
[226:45.66]Uh, so everyone here was missing.
[227:03.40]I don't know who any of these people are.
[227:04.47]I don't.
[227:04.63]I don't know the references.
[227:05.65]I mean, this is not like Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, David Spade.
[227:08.59]If those people were up here, I would know who they were.
[227:35.65]What's Benny Goodman like in person?
[227:37.63]Benny could do things with a clarinet that nobody else could.
[227:41.05]Well, thank God, one night after a show in New York, I'll just tell you it was the damnedest thing I ever saw, and leave it at that.
[227:50.68]I know who they are, my God.
[227:53.36]I don't know who they are.
[227:55.14]I know who two of them are.
[228:01.29]But honestly, this could be Don Knotts.
[228:04.43]I don't know.
[228:05.31]From The Andy Griffith Show.
[228:09.53]I don't know who that is.
[228:13.54]Was Count Basie really a vampire?
[228:15.80]A golem, actually, but we never held that against him.
[228:19.08]Those were simpler times.
[228:24.30]Alright.
[228:24.62]So, song.
[228:54.17]help with.
[228:55.05]I'm trying to find just that perfect sound for my next big hit.
[229:00.73]Oh, is that all?
[229:04.35]That's it.
[229:05.03]That's it.
[229:05.95]Well, gee, thanks.
[229:07.20]But I don't want to just put out a repeat of my early stuff.
[229:10.86]It's got to be new and fresh.
[229:13.52]But I'm stuck on two things.
[229:16.04]I need a catchy melody, and I need a good train sound.
[229:19.76]You need a train sound.
[229:22.72]You need a melody and a train.
[229:25.48]You need a melody and a train whistle for your song?
[229:28.68]Oh, you bet.
[229:30.36]I'm pulling out all the stops.
[229:32.44]This song's gonna be about all the things the kids are into these days.
[229:37.55]The song's gonna be perfect.
[229:39.41]I'll show you.
[229:39.91]This is what I got so far.
[229:40.83]Do you like it?
[229:41.13]Do you think it'll be good with the kids?
[230:10.09]okay keep on rocking clan word if I had a hammer oh you can take that mallet if you want I was going to use it for percussion but I decided though and I get the gun right any direction that doesn't involve hitting things with hammers is no direction I want to go thank you and good day sir
[230:47.40]That's it!
[230:47.78]That's it!
[230:48.18]Oh my god!
[230:48.92]That's it!
[230:49.28]You did it!
[230:53.84]Okay, um, whatever.
[230:58.61]I can hit the gongs.
[231:00.55]So we need a train sound.
[231:10.26]What?
[231:10.92]Oh.
[231:11.88]Stop!
[231:14.34]So what do these gongs do?
[231:23.45]Uh, a portal just showed up.
[231:24.69]Um, okay.
[231:25.03]What's the deal?
[231:28.63]What's going on here?
[231:31.68]Okay.
[231:47.90]If you control the wind, let's see a demonstration.
[231:50.38]Eh, I'm not really in the mood.
[231:53.07]Not in the mood?
[231:54.11]Come on, blow us up a typhoon.
[231:56.15]I guess I've just got a case of the blars.
[231:59.41]I don't know.
[232:01.87]Sacred stones.
[232:05.88]Okay, so I'm going to make you happy, so you blow...
[232:11.52]Alright.
[232:12.52]Won't do it.
[232:13.06]Alright.
[232:13.86]So we need to make them happy.
[232:14.52]So this causes the triangles to appear.
[232:15.50]Can more than one appear?
[232:40.79]Or can just one appear?
[232:41.89]Is it just one that shows up and teleports over this way?
[232:45.72]Okay, so that... I guess I can maybe do it on this one and I can reach into it.
[232:53.82]Maybe I can see what's in it.
[232:56.54]Where does it go?
[233:02.12]Alright, so...
[233:12.54]Oh, that's the... Okay, that's this one.
[233:14.04]Okay, so now... For some reason, I thought these were... Okay, so can I reach in and grab his head?
[233:23.03]Let's see what happens.
[233:28.39]Goldfish memory.
[233:33.69]You know, I'm getting... Let me tell you something.
[233:37.72]I'm getting real sick and tired of people questioning...
[233:48.86]No, no, cut it.
[233:49.46]Cut the music.
[233:50.32]Cut the music.
[233:51.02]Let me tell you something.
[234:02.97]It's like the back of the head.
[234:04.77]Wait, there's a gong over here.
[234:16.60]so I okay here's where this I don't understand I can't reach in why why would this matter I'm assuming there's an item that I need to do all these things check this out max
[234:42.80]All I can do is put my hand in there, but if I had something else I could transfer it around, but what?
[234:50.27]Well, I could go back to the real world.
[234:52.37]I think I have exhausted all the options here besides the picnic.
[234:59.43]Let me go over here.
[235:00.24]Don't you think it's amazing that you found that picnic basket full of food?
[235:03.88]Not really.
[235:04.94]It was sitting right there.
[235:06.36]You couldn't miss it.
[235:10.00]How's the vacation going?
[235:11.65]Oh, the weather's perfect, and there's so much history and culture.
[235:15.97]The best part is that Abe and I finally get some time all to ourselves.
[235:20.09]Let's talk to everybody again.
[235:21.49]No distractions.
[235:22.45]Okay, no distractions.
[235:23.29]Isn't that right, Abe?
[235:25.25]Abe?
[235:25.49]What?
[235:26.77]Oh, yeah, right.
[235:27.65]Culture.
[235:30.51]The volcano's going to explode.
[235:31.47]The volcano's going to erupt in a deadly rain of fiery magma.
[235:34.61]Aren't you worried?
[235:35.61]Are you sure you're a dog?
[235:37.25]Because you sound like a big chicken.
[235:40.16]What's with that?
[235:41.52]Abe, what's going on here?
[235:42.68]Why are you so... ...kissy and annoyed?
[235:43.95]Uh oh.
[235:44.09]Trouble in Paradise.
[236:07.88]Have fun, kids.
[236:09.02]Don't wait up.
[236:14.43]So long, you two.
[236:15.19]Talk to you, talk to you.
[236:18.87]What about you?
[236:19.33]This is the one that doesn't like me.
[236:21.59]Why the long face?
[236:22.97]It's just that we've been here for so long, and there's so little for us to do.
[236:26.49]I have to question the soul-crushing bleakness of our existence, and... Oh, wait.
[236:32.15]You're making fun of me, aren't you?
[236:33.72]Took him long enough to catch on.
[236:35.80]The way that sob story was going, I thought he was about to show us baby pictures and have us sign his yearbook.
[236:41.21]Not cool.
[236:42.23]Alright.
[236:44.71]I want to hear a joke.
[236:45.67]Hey, how many volcano gods does it take to screw in a light bulb?
[236:49.12]Hackneyed and blasphemous.
[236:51.64]Sheesh.
[236:52.36]Top island.
[236:54.26]okay what do you uh how about this product you believe in all this prophecy of destruction mumbo jumbo of course I do I can feel rana cow's anger rumbling even now me too sam I think those tamales from stinkies are repeating on me ah it's got a logical humor very classy
[237:14.57]Don't worry.
[237:15.39]Be happy.
[237:16.21]So, your civilization is coming to a fiery, cataclysmic end.
[237:19.79]Don't sweat it.
[237:20.95]I'm glad you can joke about the end of our civilization.
[237:22.97]I don't find it particularly funny.
[237:24.68]Okay.
[237:28.40]What's your story?
[237:29.56]If you must know, I am the keeper of the power of Earth.
[237:32.18]The keeper of the power of Earth.
[237:33.74]Why don't you give us a demonstration?
[237:35.46]I'm not going to unleash the tremendous power of the Earth God on just a whim.
[237:40.81]Shake the Earth.
[237:41.48]Okay, so shake, earthquake, wind.
[237:45.56]This isn't some game.
[237:46.80]I wasn't granted elemental powers just to amuse you.
[237:50.12]Are we going to have to dig this guy up to get the stick out of his butt?
[237:54.03]He wasn't always like this.
[237:56.53]There was a time centuries ago when the ground would shake with his laughter.
[238:02.39]And there was a time when you didn't need a sandblaster to fit in your ceremonial dress.
[238:08.14]That was uncalled for.
[238:11.37]Okay, gotta make this one laugh, this one happy.
[238:14.58]Hmm.
[238:16.88]Alright, so how do we make you laugh?
[238:21.24]Hmm.
[238:21.38]So, comedy?
[238:36.99]Funny, something... happy... I don't know about you, though.
[238:44.66]Alright, let's go back to Earth.
[238:47.50]And explore a little bit.
[238:48.68]I think I have an idea of what's going on here.
[238:53.08]Can I shoot the fish?
[238:54.64]Sometimes the simplest answer is the easiest one.
[239:04.51]No.
[239:20.23]So what about the diner?
[239:21.87]Anything in here?
[239:23.15]Oh, I can talk to these.
[239:23.81]I remember they said they wouldn't talk until I stopped the triangle.
[239:27.35]Howdy, cops.
[239:28.35]Anything new in the auto body business?
[239:30.47]Do you want to have ladies love you and men want to be you?
[239:34.20]Naturally.
[239:35.28]Make that dream a reality with our brand new car!
[239:40.70]With a captivating melody composed by our resident musical maestro.
[239:46.82]O-M-F-G-I-1-1!
[239:49.13]Alright, enough with the sales pitch.
[239:50.91]How much?
[239:51.83]It is not for sale.
[239:53.39]Turn on!
[239:54.94]We're sorry.
[239:56.42]The Synthotronic audio enhancer is available exclusively to beta testers of our new augmented reality game.
[240:06.42]Alright, there's a new... Tell us about the new game.
[240:09.01]Tell us about this new game you're working on.
[240:11.37]That is correct.
[240:12.47]It will revolutionize the entire industry.
[240:16.27]A music-based video game.
[240:20.19]We are sorry.
[240:21.45]Did we just blow your mind?
[240:24.83]I don't like to brag, but my prowess at Banjo Legend Extreme is pretty renowned throughout the Tri-State area.
[240:30.67]And I've been banned from 27 local arcades for playing Forbidden Dance Insurrection in ways the designers never intended.
[240:38.46]Does not compute.
[240:39.76]You are saying that music video games already exist?
[240:46.78]Can we play the new game?
[240:47.94]How do we play this game of yours?
[240:49.61]In a world where folk music instruments litter the mean streets, your mission is clear.
[240:54.95]Destroy all the bagpipes!
[240:57.19]Well, here's the melody for the, you know, the guy in there that I don't remember his name.
[241:02.91]Earning more points the closer we get to being in rhythm with the soundtrack?
[241:06.74]That's way too complicated!
[241:09.44]Calculating that would require processing power far beyond error, not a number.
[241:16.64]Just destroy all the bagpipes to win our exclusive new car horn.
[241:21.02]We hate bagpipes!
[241:23.01]Would you like to play our game?
[241:24.89]Mm-hmm.
[241:26.27]Let's do it.
[241:33.81]So we have to run stuff over again.
[241:35.96]Hello, and welcome to the Pimplicar Music Challenge.
[241:39.98]Your goal is to drive over the bagpipes, and only the bagpipes.
[241:43.78]Bring the noise!
[241:46.22]Thanks to advances in nanotechnology and the dog car, you can now drive using a computer keyboard in addition to your mouse.
[241:54.04]Ready?
[241:55.11]Go!
[241:55.51]Where are the bagpipes?
[242:01.89]You see any bagpipes?
[242:03.41]I do.
[242:04.29]I see them!
[242:11.45]Oh, the long, long day.
[242:14.15]Right.
[242:14.91]Where the bitsy, bitsy spider moved on to be.
[242:32.85]Down came the rain and washed the spiders out of... Okay, get him.
[242:58.74]Full bar.
[242:59.14]Congratulations, you are a winner!
[243:03.93]What is that?
[243:04.29]Did you see that thing rolling at the end?
[243:08.31]So is it a train?
[243:11.97]So what is the sound?
[243:12.87]It's like the melody, right?
[243:14.85]How does it go?
[243:33.68]want to hear it I just want to make max happy for a second just for I needed to do it just for one second I know he's it's okay alright so I have the musical maker from these guys let's go in the diner how are you stinky what oh
[244:04.98]Nothing doing.
[244:06.80]Anything else I need in here?
[244:09.07]Specials.
[244:11.27]Camp David Granite.
[244:13.05]What is it?
[244:13.45]Camp David Granite Grinder.
[244:15.23]Little Tykes Grinder with... This I... That's... Okay.
[244:22.84]Anything I can do?
[244:23.80]Palm tree.
[244:24.32]Wait.
[244:25.52]Can I get a coconut or... It doesn't need a gardener.
[244:27.86]It needs a plastic surgeon.
[244:29.16]Napoleon... Not pictured?
[244:32.86]His right hand.
[244:36.46]Is one of those people on the island Gene Shalit?
[244:38.58]And then there's Jesus.
[245:07.13]Okay, they have these little passwords under here.
[245:14.55]Air horn.
[245:14.95]Is this your pipe, Stinky?
[245:17.58]Yes, I looted it from the corpse of a 50-foot Sherlock Holmes.
[245:21.82]Can we have it?
[245:25.22]No.
[245:26.42]Come on, that's... Is this your pipe, Stinky?
[245:27.68]Yes, I looted... I know, but what about these things?
[245:32.08]Where's the van?
[245:33.24]I keep hiring drummers, but they keep combusting.
[245:36.02]And not slowly over time, either.
[245:38.61]Spontaneously.
[245:39.67]I can't, like, take that for his music shop?
[245:47.42]Alright, well, I can bring the horn back.
[245:49.32]We'll try that.
[246:04.10]Anything in Bosco's that I didn't do.
[246:05.44]What about the office?
[246:14.43]Hey, Moscow.
[246:16.79]What do you know about Easter Island?
[246:18.59]Why?
[246:19.55]Who told you to ask me that?
[246:21.39]Just some guy outside in a black suit and sunglasses.
[246:24.45]Seem to know a lot about you, Bosco.
[246:26.48]They're getting closer!
[246:29.99]Bosco, has the water been tasting funny to you?
[246:32.21]Why am I doing this to him?
[246:34.07]Ever since we saw those government guys working on the pipes down the street.
[246:37.55]It tastes like control and makes me want to pay taxes.
[246:41.38]Good thing I distilled, sanitized, and recycled my own water.
[246:46.94]He gets it.
[246:47.44]You know anything about those black helicopters hovering outside?
[246:50.11]Stop trying to freak me out, fools.
[246:52.75]I'm busy.
[246:55.39]Hey Bosco, did you know you're being watched?
[246:57.57]Do you guys even know me?
[246:59.82]Of course I know that!
[247:01.38]No, we mean right now, from inside Stinky's.
[247:04.56]Y'all just trying to make me paranoid.
[247:06.76]You think I don't have a camera inside Stinky's?
[247:09.75]I'd know if I was being watched.
[247:12.09]Where's the camera?
[247:13.23]It's genius.
[247:14.67]Hidden inside the pie that nobody ever eats.
[247:17.87]Oops.
[247:18.65]By the way, tell Stinky her place would look a lot better if she didn't have that big black lump in the booth that looks like a small intestine.
[247:29.42]Where you planning to go?
[247:30.96]Oh, you'd like me to tell you where my emergency bunker is?
[247:34.90]No chance.
[247:35.88]You'll have to stop goofing off in Bill Jones.
[247:38.68]It's just like the fable of the grasshopper and the ant.
[247:41.42]If the ant were a paranoid lunatic.
[247:43.38]And the grasshoppers, too, come to think of it.
[247:46.56]Alright.
[247:47.04]Where's the emergency bunker?
[247:48.98]But where's your emergency bunker, Bosco?
[247:51.64]For the last time, my secret bunker's secret location is a secret.
[247:58.48]Do you have any honey bunches of pumice branch cereal?
[248:01.98]Yes.
[248:02.68]It's good, and it's good for you.
[248:04.73]And it's all for the bunker.
[248:06.49]We're gonna find the bunker.
[248:07.57]Do you have any stem packs and radiation cams?
[248:09.88]Fallout.
[248:10.36]Sure do.
[248:11.04]Cool.
[248:11.46]It wouldn't be a good emergency bunker without them.
[248:14.94]Unfortunately, they had to pay... I think the settlement was four to five million dollars.
[248:20.88]Out of court.
[248:22.52]Bethesda did not like that at all.
[248:24.98]It's kind of sad.
[248:26.34]Do you have any zombie repellent?
[248:28.11]Get out of here!
[248:28.91]There's no such thing as zombies!
[248:31.01]That's just what they want you to think.
[248:37.89]Do you have any powdered drink mix?
[248:39.73]Cases of it in every flavor you can think of.
[248:43.32]Three-day-old rigatoni stuffed with marshmallow peeps in an orange soda reduction with a hint of cilantro.
[248:49.57]Every flavor a normal person can think of.
[248:54.74]Uh, is that it?
[248:56.14]Do you have any eyeglass repair kits?
[248:58.22]Not much worse than being stuck in the apocalypse with all the time in the world to read and then have your glasses break.
[249:03.84]Y'all think I'm an amateur?
[249:05.38]This bunker is going to be 100% irony proof.
[249:10.88]Do you have any... Look, for the last time, it's all for the bunker.
[249:15.90]Give it a rest already.
[249:17.00]Alright, see you, Bosco.
[249:22.81]Not for long.
[249:29.46]I don't think there's anything left I can do in here.
[249:31.60]I do know about an emergency bunker, which is probably the bathroom.
[249:35.92]It's definitely the bathroom.
[249:58.65]Do the grandpa voice?
[250:00.75]For what?
[250:02.47]Just right now?
[250:04.41]Just because?
[250:04.93]Nothing else down here.
[250:09.01]Let me go into the office.
[250:20.67]Wait, wait, wait.
[250:21.65]Was there anything else over here I could do?
[250:25.17]Miss me already, chumps?
[250:27.45]Well, I ain't coming back no matter how much you beg.
[250:30.93]The place just isn't the same without your persistent funk and wheezy snoring.
[250:34.45]It's your birthday, please.
[250:35.27]Yeah, well, I'm done with that rat hole.
[250:37.62]Happy birthday, Mega Aggro.
[250:38.96]This is extra class.
[250:40.56]We're gonna do it up now.
[250:41.68]Have a wonderful birthday party.
[250:43.40]And hope all your friends come and they have all kinds of toys for you.
[250:46.70]Because that's all that fucking matters in your birthday party is if somebody brings you something to eat and brings you toys.
[250:52.54]That's all I get.
[250:55.25]Happy birthday, there you go, that was a free birthday.
[250:57.15]Nah.
[251:00.94]No way.
[251:19.89]Oh god.
[251:20.98]There's nothing we can do to torture me Elmer that hasn't been done to him already.
[251:24.25]Torture me Elmer.
[251:24.93]Yeah, you were pretty thorough last night.
[251:27.81]What?
[251:31.41]Oh, God.
[251:34.02]Check the closet.
[251:35.02]Always check the closet.
[251:37.02]There they are.
[251:37.74]The finest in remote control fisticuffs.
[251:46.84]Leonard looks surprisingly healthy for someone who's been in the closet for six months.
[251:50.60]I've been feeding him.
[251:51.98]Aw, you old softy.
[251:53.38]I've been feeding him.
[251:54.07]I had to find some way to get rid of all those spiders.
[251:56.21]This is some fucked up inhumane shit going on in the closet here.
[252:09.28]Just like Max, this desk is full of handy secret compartments.
[252:14.37]Okay, desk land.
[252:15.13]I don't think I... I think I just gotta keep going.
[252:29.36]I think we just have to go back.
[252:32.28]And do the music thing.
[252:33.58]That's all I have.
[252:39.57]Let's go see if I can blow the horn in his head.
[252:53.13]Let's try this.
[252:59.58]So we've got the horn.
[253:03.76]Hey, Glenn, listen to this action.
[253:09.82]That's fantastic.
[253:11.38]You like it?
[253:11.78]Who wrote it?
[253:12.92]Bring him with you so I can work with him full time.
[253:16.20]I don't think he'd like it here.
[253:17.68]No outlets.
[253:18.92]Well, in any case, that's the perfect melody for my new hit.
[253:23.35]Now just find me a good train sound and we're all set.
[253:28.63]A good train sound.
[253:34.56]Why is there a train?
[253:37.43]Is there a whistle or something I can find?
[253:40.03]How about this glass?
[253:44.39]Well, okay.
[253:46.78]Diaper rash dispenser?
[253:47.96]Ugh.
[253:55.83]No.
[253:56.05]Okay, which one sounds the best?
[253:58.74]I mean, that's just a Gatorade.
[254:00.52]I would drink this one.
[254:01.26]Alright, well, I have the cup now.
[254:02.94]Can I put this in the Fountain of Youth?
[254:30.77]The piranhas aren't in there, though.
[254:34.97]Can I have some of that?
[254:41.52]Maybe something with the portal.
[254:42.56]Can I, like, put the... Cup in the portal, or... They're gonna jump out at me.
[254:51.98]Did I get it?
[254:52.71]Was I fast enough?
[254:56.15]No, I gotta stop them.
[255:00.29]Let me just see what happens if I do this.
[255:02.95]I'm just curious if I can put things inside.
[255:04.79]No.
[255:11.62]So how do I take care of this?
[255:17.24]Nope.
[255:22.70]Can I actually use the cup on anything?
[255:24.44]Can I fill the cup?
[255:27.04]Hold on.
[255:36.36]Can I drink one of these?
[255:37.94]Or put one in?
[255:39.80]The Diaper Rash.
[255:40.90]Ingredients?
[255:41.91]Bourbon, guava juice, mint, and talcum powder.
[255:45.11]The talcum powder is the only thing that's not good there.
[255:47.77]Can I use it?
[255:49.81]Oh, actually, I can.
[255:50.69]I can fill it up.
[256:01.27]They've already got their drink.
[256:08.29]Hyper Rat.
[256:08.88]Hold on.
[256:11.24]What's the other one?
[256:13.08]Kerosene, Pepper Spray, Wasabi.
[256:14.64]Hold on, I wonder.
[256:15.20]No, just dump it.
[256:16.08]No, don't get more.
[256:16.98]Get the one that hurts.
[256:42.46]So is there somebody I can feed this to?
[256:44.76]I don't think that would work.
[256:45.74]Would we just dump it in the piranha pool?
[256:47.35]I feel like that's too easy.
[256:51.09]Let's try you.
[257:00.27]Want a drink, Mr. Hoffa?
[257:01.93]Jimmy Hoffa cannot accept a drink from non- Do you want it in your sippy cup?
[257:07.32]I didn't mean to do that.
[257:07.94]I want it served by a dues-paying member of the waitress's union.
[257:13.08]How do we get into the waitress's union?
[257:15.24]Fortunately for you, I am the union leader and also dues collector.
[257:21.01]Yeah, yeah.
[257:21.81]I know a setup when I see one.
[257:23.89]I suppose you want a favor to let us in the union.
[257:25.89]The game has too many jimmies.
[257:27.09]You can keep from spilling on the paying customers.
[257:30.27]Take a tray of drinks and ride the fucking surfboard without dropping anything.
[257:36.22]What?
[257:39.58]Oh, God.
[257:40.08]Now I have to ride the surfboard.
[257:44.57]Let me just see.
[257:49.23]Can I just dump this poison in here?
[257:54.79]No, no, no.
[257:55.23]Dump the poison in there.
[257:57.59]Poison the fish.
[257:59.97]I guess I can't.
[258:00.59]We gotta just keep this going.
[258:09.08]Hold this.
[258:09.70]Don't drop anything.
[258:10.54]Alright, here we go.
[258:16.06]Waitress tray.
[258:16.88]Wipeout.
[258:19.14]I'm gonna fuck this up for like an hour straight.
[258:25.25]Oh yeah, I'm gonna screw this up for like a fucking full hour.
[258:29.07]I'll see you guys when I never complete it.
[258:30.83]The sun was in my eye.
[258:32.49]The sun was in my eye.
[258:57.96]Straight up.
[258:59.52]Straight up!
[259:00.02]Oh yeah!
[259:00.66]How much time has it been?
[259:07.41]Third time's a charm.
[259:08.25]So, I did it.
[259:08.67]Now, excuse me sir.
[259:09.17]Wait, hold on.
[259:27.80]Jerma never loses.
[259:29.52]I did what you wanted me to do, so let's talk.
[259:36.72]How about this one?
[259:57.21]Do you like that?
[259:57.97]How do you like that?
[259:58.45]Didn't even flinch.
[259:59.25]Um, okay.
[259:59.53]Well.
[259:59.69]Can I... Wait a minute.
[260:00.84]Can I...
[260:26.20]Kerosene.
[260:27.12]Can I burn it?
[260:27.82]Can I give him, like, a fire drink?
[260:32.34]That's what this is for.
[260:39.12]Uh... There's nothing in it.
[260:47.06]Okay, now put... Now put... What?
[260:53.41]What in there?
[260:53.91]Which one?
[260:54.73]The same one?
[260:55.31]Diaper rash?
[261:03.76]Well, we're the same one.
[261:04.58]Pardon me, boys.
[261:11.59]Is that the Rapa Nui choo-choo?
[261:13.25]Oh, it's the train.
[261:14.01]No, it's just an illiterate simulacrum of a train whistle we constructed out of everyday household items.
[261:19.57]Don't say simulacrum.
[261:21.16]Well, that's perfect.
[261:22.74]That's just the sound I need for my big hit.
[261:26.36]Let's get started making musical history, boys.
[261:34.52]There's a demo on that conch shell.
[261:36.68]This is going to be huge.
[261:38.62]Are we going to get a producer credit?
[261:41.10]Talk to my agent.
[261:45.01]So, where do we do this?
[261:49.61]Do we do it now?
[261:50.43]Do it here?
[261:51.03]What do we want to do with it?
[261:51.91]Who needs this demo?
[261:58.16]I need to get him a drink, though.
[262:01.66]I'm sure they've already heard it.
[262:19.74]I know what that is.
[262:22.52]Mm-hmm.
[262:58.81]Uh-huh.
[262:59.45]Put this through, play it, it'll make you happy.
[263:06.28]Hmm, this isn't bad.
[263:09.18]It has the info, yes.
[263:11.04]Could do without the train sound, but the rest, it's downright toe-tapping.
[263:20.78]What is that?
[263:22.56]Oh, no.
[263:23.26]Whistling sound.
[263:25.36]Abe, are you even listening to me?
[263:28.52]Unfaithful Abe!
[263:36.36]Okay, so wait a minute, hold on.
[263:41.90]Did we put... Abe, hold on.
[263:57.25]So long, you two.
[263:59.90]What's left of Noah's Ark?
[264:00.90]We'll have to change a... I wonder if there's a way... Not happening.
[264:11.85]Whistle... So what is this?
[264:13.37]Does she whistle into this?
[264:14.93]No, he needs to come up.
[264:21.23]I can maybe put something... A wants to go over there.
[264:25.23]I think I need something else.
[264:26.15]Well, you're not in the mood, fine.
[264:27.27]Alright, so how do I get you to move now?
[264:43.01]I definitely have to give him another drink of the Fountain Youth.
[264:45.23]He's gonna take a drink of the Fountain Youth and he's gonna turn into an amoeba.
[264:49.94]That's what's gonna happen.
[264:50.62]What the fuck is he doing?
[265:09.28]Give him another drink.
[265:37.41]He tried this one.
[265:38.81]This one has actual alcohol in it.
[265:42.57]Drunk baby.
[265:51.85]This is illegal.
[265:54.87]Oh Abe, isn't it beautiful?
[265:57.01]That gentle breeze and that melody in the air?
[266:04.05]Abe, ever since those heads started talking, you haven't heard one word I've said.
[266:09.02]Right.
[266:10.84]What?
[266:11.64]Oh, I mean, did they talk?
[266:12.98]I hadn't noticed.
[266:15.12]So anyway, for our next vacation, we... Hey, Wendy.
[266:18.50]Sybil, I mean, Sybil.
[266:20.14]Have you ever thought about getting some surgery done?
[266:22.87]What?
[266:23.57]I was thinking, if you had your nose stretched out so maybe you squared off the head a little, you'd look fantastic.
[266:29.73]Not that you don't look nice now, of course.
[266:31.99]That is it.
[266:33.40]You've done nothing but stare at her this entire time.
[266:37.06]Come on, I'm a man.
[266:38.44]I'm not made of stone.
[266:39.80]Well, you know what I mean.
[266:41.42]Oh, I know what you mean, alright.
[266:43.48]You're just in a mood.
[266:45.40]No, I'm not.
[266:47.11]I will long remember what you said here, and I will never forget what you did here.
[266:52.75]I just can't believe you'd insult me like this.
[266:57.19]Happy birthday, Sybil.
[266:58.13]Happy birthday today.
[266:59.97]Make sure you have a good one, have a picnic, and have some toys.
[267:03.61]That's what I want.
[267:11.68]I did that for your birthday.
[267:18.76]Didn't like it.
[267:19.52]Wow.
[267:20.50]And again, I forget to bring my video camera.
[267:25.69]Okay.
[267:26.53]Well, that happened, but we have an important task to do.
[267:29.03]It's give alcohol to a baby.
[267:39.63]Thank you.
[267:46.61]Bye-bye now.
[267:51.80]Let's try some water.
[267:59.21]Bourbon's not gonna do it.
[268:00.37]Artificial preservatives is.
[268:12.70]I was thinking... give him the... Fountain of Youth.
[268:28.73]You just don't want water?
[268:37.11]Thank you.
[268:42.93]I've got to get the piranhas out of there.
[268:49.59]I don't think we've ever tried to stop a volcano before.
[268:52.17]Not unless you count that time in the Philippines.
[268:57.86]It's definitely the fountain of youth.
[269:04.12]When you feed it to him.
[269:08.26]But, we have another scenario over here.
[269:10.79]Okay.
[269:27.73]What's left of Noah's Ark?
[269:30.67]So, uh... Want us to put in a good word for you with Sybil?
[269:33.67]Nah, I've still got a shot with the locals.
[269:36.93]Not even after another thousand years.
[269:40.97]Wow, I haven't seen rejection on that scale since I whomped you in the last election.
[269:45.31]Okay.
[269:46.95]Don't you think it's amazing that you found that picnic basket full of food?
[269:50.54]I've got more important things to do.
[269:52.36]Should I go talk to Sybil?
[269:53.88]Maybe I should go talk to Sybil.
[269:56.47]What's back there?
[269:57.69]Is there a gong back here?
[270:08.17]What?
[270:09.79]How do I get over there?
[270:14.79]We have five community subs from Splarg.
[270:17.47]Thank you, Splarg.
[270:19.07]For your five subs.
[270:20.47]Thank you.
[270:24.35]That has to mean something.
[270:32.59]I don't think I can reach that.
[270:33.63]I don't think I can shoot it from here.
[270:37.19]Are you serious?
[270:38.37]I don't need the gong?
[270:40.99]Well, what am I supposed to put over there?
[271:00.10]What happens?
[271:00.54]Is there anything over here?
[271:05.75]I don't think this will... uh... nothing doing.
[271:17.22]Damn.
[271:17.68]Alright, well that's probably for... that's the volcano.
[271:25.00]Here?
[271:27.26]Hold on.
[271:33.33]And blow the whistle into here.
[271:34.99]She's gonna blow and it's gonna come out the other side.
[271:38.23]Watch this.
[271:38.71]Ready?
[271:40.61]No, it's not.
[271:41.43]What?
[271:42.97]You'd probably make more friends if you'd just enunciate more clearly.
[271:57.58]What would that... That wouldn't accomplish anything.
[271:59.78]But what do I need to do with that?
[272:03.83]Um... It's a silver gong.
[272:15.60]Hmm.
[272:20.75]Can I...?
[272:22.75]No way.
[272:36.11]No, no, that's not going to do it, is it?
[272:42.24]No, it's not.
[272:45.26]Something has to come out of here.
[272:46.46]Wait, hold on.
[273:13.74]I got it.
[273:14.26]I know what to do.
[273:15.50]I know what to do.
[273:16.73]I got it.
[273:16.99]I got it.
[273:17.57]I got it.
[273:17.85]Here we go.
[273:18.37]I gotta be quick.
[273:20.11]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[273:46.67]This is going to be a complete... Yeah.
[273:49.65]Because now I'm going to get the water, and then I'm going to go give it to Hoffa, and then I'm going to get in.
[273:53.24]Alright, let's go.
[274:01.92]I wanted to do this fast.
[274:04.12]Not fast enough.
[274:13.97]Nooo!
[274:20.72]Hold on.
[274:28.76]I can... I can... Shoot.
[274:30.34]Wait.
[274:31.32]Hold on.
[274:31.84]I can stand here.
[274:35.34]This... And, um... So...
[274:47.31]Do the conk, and then shoot over here, and then run over there.
[274:57.15]Let's see.
[275:00.03]Okay, here we go.
[275:00.65]Ready?
[275:00.89]Three, two, one.
[275:04.54]Put the plan into play.
[275:24.13]Hurry!
[275:25.73]Hurry!
[275:28.91]AHH!
[275:32.11]Ohhhh, what's happening to me?!
[275:38.19]I still have to get him angry!
[275:45.65]No, that's... I gotta do this a different way.
[275:47.16]Hold on.
[275:53.16]Wait, can I...
[275:57.03]I don't even have to use the portals.
[276:02.22]Okay.
[276:04.24]That changes everything.
[276:08.04]Great.
[276:09.08]So, let's just have it set up.
[276:21.93]Yeah, GG.
[276:25.19]Here we go.
[276:31.69]Alright, start it.
[276:36.74]Get him mad.
[276:37.38]Blow it in there.
[276:39.20]Strike the lightning.
[276:47.64]Get mad!
[276:48.22]Bingo.
[277:00.16]Anybody have any malt vinegar?
[277:03.88]Thank you, everybody.
[277:04.70]Thank you, the three heads.
[277:07.59]Here you go, Jimmy.
[277:10.33]Time for you to drink into oblivion.
[277:22.33]Take it.
[277:22.59]You're gonna turn into a single-celled organism.
[277:29.74]Thank you.
[277:30.64]Hmm.
[277:31.60]This tastes familiar.
[277:33.58]I can't place exactly where... Oh, wait.
[277:38.27]I remember.
[277:41.83]Sorry, Max.
[277:42.87]I know you were getting attached to the little guy, but it's for the good of the island.
[277:46.67]Attached to who?
[277:47.93]Oh, right.
[277:48.53]Did he leave his gun?
[277:55.82]I thought he was going to turn into like an amiibo or a cell or something.
[278:00.22]That would have been fun.
[278:01.44]I just shrunk him and popped him.
[278:03.36]What movie?
[278:03.76]What is it?
[278:04.14]Oh my god.
[278:05.22]Who Framed Roger Rabbit, right?
[278:27.56]Is that- what movie is it?
[278:28.78]The big, like, kissing?
[278:29.80]Where's it from?
[278:30.78]Whoop!
[278:51.89]High priest has spoken.
[278:54.49]You to be executed.
[279:00.16]Now hang on.
[279:01.40]What you have say for self?
[279:04.88]Um, you can't kill us.
[279:05.98]We're famous.
[279:07.34]Be reasonable, seahorse monkeys.
[279:09.24]But your spatula is evil.
[279:11.18]Your high priest is a false prophet.
[279:13.70]That very serious claim to make.
[279:17.54]Could make us lose tax-exempt status.
[279:20.87]How you back it up?
[279:22.33]With a fillet knife and some sushi rice.
[279:24.93]Kill them!
[279:29.14]Uh, you can't kill us, we're famous.
[279:30.56]Okay.
[279:58.37]Think about what you're doing.
[279:59.71]You seem like a fairly reasonable group of, uh, what are you anyway?
[280:04.31]We are the Underfoot, protectors of the sacred home of Ranakau, the volcano god.
[280:11.29]The air breeders call us ocean chimps.
[280:14.75]We no like that name.
[280:18.82]Okay, enough of these.
[280:20.14]We know that impostor is lying because Max is the true high priest.
[280:24.56]He does have feet.
[280:26.06]Maybe Shulo's dog speaks the truth.
[280:29.06]Look, we ancient civilization that worship giant feet who speak to us through ghost fish, high priest.
[280:36.17]We're not gullible if white one with mouth truly is high priest.
[280:41.73]He prove it by fulfilling the ancient prophecies.
[280:45.87]I bet there are three of them.
[280:47.63]He knows our ancient traditions.
[280:50.04]Maybe he really is the chosen one.
[280:52.88]Ancients say that an outsider will be anointed by the feet.
[280:57.58]The feet will recognize him.
[281:00.17]And he will perform great miracle to feed his people.
[281:03.77]What was water becomes delicious treat.
[281:07.77]And the island itself will show us the face of the true high priest.
[281:13.96]He appears before us in the living rock.
[281:20.44]How does Max get anointed by the feet?
[281:21.82]Explain this whole anointed by the feet business.
[281:23.90]The great feet speak to us through the high priest.
[281:28.38]The outsiders stand under the great feet.
[281:31.60]They move to show they accept him.
[281:35.18]Okay.
[281:38.99]What kind of miracle are you guys looking for?
[281:41.50]The high priest feed us all by turning water to banang.
[281:48.66]Banang!
[281:49.28]Banang!
[281:49.88]Banang!
[281:51.08]A delicious banana flavored drink that fortified with essential vitamins and minerals.
[281:59.11]Niacin!
[282:01.23]That's the fake water with banana flavoring.
[282:06.96]What do you mean about the island showing his true face?
[282:09.95]Prophecies say image of true High Priest will appear to us in the cavern.
[282:16.83]That prove our High Priest is the one.
[282:20.50]Look!
[282:25.46]You mean that image of Max?
[282:28.34]Alright, so we have to put his ears down.

[283:45.64]Whose feet are these, though?
[283:59.44]Nothing.
[284:00.54]Give it a minute.
[284:01.62]The feet just don't recognize me without the mustache.
[284:04.36]You waste our time.
[284:06.10]Feet say you not high-braced.

[286:12.55]I'm gonna have to bring something over here.
[286:16.33]Machine pod.
[286:17.31]It's the entrance to the lava machine.
[286:19.39]That only used by high priest.
[286:22.56]We're in his entourage.
[286:24.24]His entourage is just me.
[286:26.38]What are you thinking?
[286:27.04]Only I can open magic door.

[287:39.40]Let's check everything else.
[287:50.99]Wow, we really are off course, vanished, set adrift, and disoriented.
[287:54.97]But what does it all mean, Sam?
[287:57.41]I don't feel like waiting around for years to find out.
[288:00.29]No, no, no.
[288:01.71]No.
[288:05.21]Jeremy, you're playing fetish games.
[288:08.39]This all started with Mr. Mosquito, and now all of a sudden it's like, do I play anything else?
[288:12.60]Interesting Seaside reading.

[291:01.19]I'm ready for you, suckers.
[291:02.83]You just hide behind me.
[291:04.96]We heard that, Bosco.
[291:07.04]We are not amused.
[291:08.46]I can't talk.
[291:10.08]Gotta go.

[291:26.09]No, no, it's not.
[291:33.35]Let's not do that.
[291:37.34]No, we're not going to do that.
[291:52.09]I feel like it's this one, but we'll come back out.
[291:56.05]Crate?
[291:57.11]Crate's full of video games about crates.
[292:04.64]Alright, so let's go back over here.
[292:11.13]The Maxish Clam.
[292:14.67]Another one of nature's horrifying wonders.
[292:17.29]I gotta agree with the chimp, Sam.
[292:19.27]That looks nothing like me.
[292:20.78]So we need to have... we need to change his nose?
[292:23.06]What?
[292:23.50]Okay, wait, hold on.
[292:25.94]So we've got... Can I do anything with this?
[292:32.56]Alright, I can put that in here.
[292:41.22]It's the desperate for the most relaxing trip on Easter Island.
[292:44.36]Bring plenty of basalt.
[292:46.20]It's a mind-altering substance for the Moai that helps them tune in, turn on, and drop out.
[292:52.06]Can I shoot that?
[292:53.69]And turn it on?
[292:54.09]Guns don't work underwater.
[292:55.35]Guns don't work underwater.
[292:56.33]Is there one next to his head?
[292:57.43]A precariously hanging stalactite.
[292:59.29]Let me go just look at it for a second.
[293:04.31]Whee!
[293:04.43]There's this one.
[293:07.62]The water cooler is one of the most often repeated forms appearing in nature.
[293:17.77]So there's something right next to his head.
[293:23.03]He has one right next to him, right?
[293:26.98]It's this one.
[293:27.52]Let's go back down.
[293:37.06]Because it's one, two, three, right?
[293:47.25]What do you mean not that way?
[293:47.99]Wait, what do you mean wrong?
[293:53.33]It's the middle one?
[293:54.37]Isn't it right next to the third feet?
[293:56.65]Right here?
[293:56.97]What do you mean no?
[294:05.69]No.
[294:12.40]It's the middle one.
[294:18.02]No, I'm trying to activate the stalagmite next to him.
[294:22.03]Because here's three.
[294:34.62]I mean, I know I can do the singing thing now.
[294:41.52]I thought this was going to open and I was going to go this way first.
[294:46.60]The music doesn't do anything to the third one.
[294:48.92]No, but this is a portal, right?
[294:50.44]And this is the one next to him.
[294:51.36]If I activate that, I can reach in, right?
[294:53.40]Alright, so Max, get up there.
[295:12.83]Let's get Max anointed again.
[295:15.95]Does it look like a portal?
[295:18.33]Oh, mighty feet, give us a sign.
[295:22.65]Do you recognize this white stranger as your servant?
[295:32.69]I thought it looked like a portal.
[295:34.65]It could be like a portal.
[295:41.86]Look.
[295:43.01]Feet, move.
[295:44.85]He must be High Priest.
[295:46.47]Uh-huh, that's right.
[295:48.25]Bring the love.
[295:49.21]Good to see you too, Mighty Feet.
[295:51.33]Sign is clear.
[295:52.70]Mighty Feet anoint you as High Priest.
[295:56.20]Give blessing.
[295:58.96]But you still not satisfy all three prophecies.
[296:04.13]Rules very explicit on this.
[296:06.57]Show us two more and we convinced.
[296:11.96]Oh, that looks very familiar.
[296:14.06]Doesn't that... Just... let me humor myself for a second.
[296:41.79]Can I shoot it down?
[296:42.67]I don't think I can shoot it down.
[296:46.69]He's gonna like... Okay, he's gonna laugh, and this is gonna drop.
[296:50.24]Just need to make him laugh.
[297:02.16]And then I stick that on the other... Alright.
[297:03.74]I don't know why... I'm overthinking it.
[297:05.67]I thought I had to, like, turn that into a portal.
[297:07.37]Okay, so...
[297:14.44]I've got... I've been anointed.
[297:16.32]The travel guide.
[297:18.30]Is this gonna make you laugh?

[297:28.08]It's a mind-altering substance for the moai that helps them tune in, turn on, and drop out.
[297:32.52]Alright, hold on.
[297:37.77]Let me see.
[297:39.59]Nothing else over here.
[297:40.21]Can I drink this?
[297:40.91]Let's see if I can.
[297:53.52]No, I wanted me to do it.
[297:54.10]Oh, we both did it.
[297:54.81]I can keep going.
[297:55.37]Oh, this is awesome!
[297:56.07]So what's the point of this?
[298:20.43]My best friend Max has something very important to say to you.
[298:23.99]Boobies.
[298:27.44]Whatever.
[298:28.38]Oh, you don't think that's funny?
[298:29.26]What happened to all my stuff?
[298:46.79]This makes me want to go potty.
[298:50.14]Alright, well, can we leave like this?
[298:53.18]Oh, he's gonna be little?
[298:58.12]I guess I'm just little now.
[299:01.53]Let's freak out Bosco.
[299:03.67]No kids allowed.
[299:05.05]Oh, what?
[299:09.93]What happened, Sam?
[299:11.33]I feel a sudden urge to vote Republican.
[299:14.13]We're not as young as we used to be, Max.
[299:16.16]The fountain's effects wore off quickly.
[299:20.48]Well, now I know why they drink so much of it.
[299:24.58]Okay.
[299:30.95]Jackalope.
[299:31.59]Buddha.
[299:32.85]Shipwheel.
[299:33.45]Shark.
[299:37.65]Palm tree.
[299:43.88]Is there anything I can get from here?
[299:47.12]Gong.
[299:49.33]Where's JP Morgan when you need her?
[299:52.71]Come on.
[299:54.09]Do it.
[299:55.87]Portal.
[299:56.82]Why doesn't Stinky's Gong work like the ones on Easter Island?
[300:08.87]What can we do?
[300:10.89]Is that a blood stain?
[300:11.87]I don't think we even talked to her at all.
[300:13.25]You killed Stinky.
[300:14.33]Banana.
[300:14.53]Can I have some banana?
[300:35.83]Whatever happened to the original Stinky anyway?
[300:37.97]Banana flavoring?
[300:38.45]He retired.
[300:39.47]Went on an around-the-world cruise.
[300:41.77]Stinky hated traveling.
[300:43.57]And water.
[300:44.65]And the world!
[300:45.96]Yeah, well, he must have changed his mind.
[300:48.12]So are you two going to order anything?
[300:49.54]Um... Next time you hear from him, tell Grandpa Stinky we said hello.
[300:55.94]Oh, I don't think we'll be hearing from him ever again.
[301:00.21]Because you sent him on a permanent vacation?
[301:04.44]Ever go to Easter Island?
[301:05.52]Really?
[301:06.00]Hmm.
[301:34.68]What's the special today?
[301:36.18]Oh, it's just a sandwich I whipped up for the Camp David Middle East Peace Summit in 2000.
[301:40.82]Roast beef, Munster cheese on a slab of granite on sliced sourdough.
[301:44.33]Nothing special.
[301:45.49]Slab of granite?
[301:46.47]Yeah, you know, for texture.
[301:48.77]On the kids' menu, I substitute a slab of basalt.
[301:51.41]It's easier for the little ones to digest.
[301:53.33]We're ready to order.
[301:59.80]We'd like the special.
[302:01.04]Sure.
[302:01.52]Granite sandwich coming right up.
[302:08.26]I wanted the other special.
[302:10.32]Oh, sorry.
[302:11.19]That's for kids only.
[302:12.41]FDA regulations.
[302:15.31]I come in as a kid and I get it.
[302:22.59]Max would like the kid special.
[302:24.35]That's for kids only.
[302:25.35]I have a childlike sense of wonder.
[302:28.40]Hey, I don't make the rules.
[302:31.02]We gotta go quick.
[302:35.08]I'm not that hungry.
[302:36.34]If you say so.
[302:38.77]Bye, Stinky.
[302:41.75]There's a sandwich.
[302:46.55]I gotta come back as a kid.
[302:52.67]Can I bring it out of the portal?
[302:53.81]I can bring it out of the portal.
[302:55.09]Okay.
[302:56.62]How's Bosco doing?
[303:00.44]Can we go into Bosco's inconvenience?
[303:10.85]Not here.
[303:11.25]Oh, he's in the bunker.
[303:15.31]What's this?
[303:18.67]He went into his bunker because we called him.
[303:20.55]Scared him into the bunker.
[303:44.22]He's gone now.
[303:45.20]There's got to be something I can fucking do in here.
[303:57.29]Freezer.
[304:01.51]Freezer.
[304:08.96]steal everything amazing there's a perfectly preserved squirrel and a bunch of imperfectly preserved popsicles bosco seismograph steal the seismograph to measure earthquakes and giant robot attacks have we missed any giant robot attacks nope I think we actually caused all of them microscope radio there's the radio we call them but noise 7175 there it is and larger I always thought enlargers would be smaller
[304:42.03]Think Bosco would mind if we helped ourselves to some bananae?
[304:44.95]Good question.
[304:46.03]Another good question.
[304:47.55]One can or two?
[304:49.13]One should be plenty.
[304:53.69]Found it.
[304:56.47]I'm looking around.
[304:57.02]I can't see.
[304:58.58]I can't see that from back here.
[305:00.26]I can see like a can.
[305:01.64]It's like, okay, when I got close enough, I could see it.
[305:05.72]I was going to look around.
[305:08.57]You can't read that from back here.
[305:10.85]I'm looking at like the grand scheme here, the grand space.
[305:16.42]I moused over it.
[305:17.40]I wasn't reading it, I was mousing.
[305:18.96]How far away are you?
[305:22.99]I don't know, 40 feet?
[305:23.67]30 feet, maybe?
[305:29.76]Okay, so.
[305:31.53]I've got some benang, and I've got a sandwich.
[305:35.07]I'm ready to go complete some stuff here.
[305:38.21]Back into the portal.
[305:47.32]So.
[305:48.54]Hey, look at this.
[305:52.24]I've got something for you.
[305:53.99]Would you like it?
[305:54.61]No, is it?
[305:54.79]You don't think that's funny?
[305:55.53]Why don't you think that's funny?
[306:29.26]Let's go do the water.
[306:46.37]And then... No, no, no, no, no.
[306:55.34]Can I combine these here?
[306:59.64]Oh, I can put it in the... I can put it in, like, the jug.
[307:08.47]What, what, what, whoa, whoa, what, what, what?
[307:10.75]Didn't they say they wanted water with, like, vitamins and nutrients in it?
[307:15.33]Why is everybody freaking out?
[307:16.53]I was gonna pour this in and then put the banana in there and then... They... What?
[307:30.41]This isn't Spongebob.
[307:32.83]They're underwater.
[307:33.70]What do you mean this isn't Spongebob?
[307:38.00]This is a goddamn cartoon!
[307:40.84]You want me to use cartoon logic?
[307:42.50]We're in a cartoon right now!
[307:45.36]It is Spongebob!
[307:53.57]I thought I had to, like, add, like, a sprinkle of banana flavoring.
[307:56.51]Watch as High Priest Max performs a great miracle.
[307:59.50]Oh, mighty feet!
[308:00.72]Hear my command!
[308:02.54]What was once water, make flavorful drink for my people!
[308:07.08]What was once colorless, make yellow!
[308:10.18]That not impressive.
[308:11.71]What was once without sustenance, make enriched with calcium, which is something our bodies need anyway!
[308:17.59]Just get on with it, Max.
[308:19.29]Eureka!
[308:20.05]Banang!
[308:24.65]See, it's like a powder.
[308:27.89]I thought I had to add it like a crystal light packet.
[308:32.53]Sorry.
[308:33.27]Yeah, I know about the final goddamn prophecy.
[308:39.45]Final prophecy is...
[308:55.96]Give me the sandwich.
[308:57.46]It's the Desperately Lonely Traveler's Guide to Easter Island, 1963 edition.
[309:01.22]For the most relaxing trip on Easter Island, bring plenty of basalt.
[309:06.50]It's a mind-altering substance for the Moai that helps them tune in, turn on, and drop out.
[309:11.18]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[309:19.79]Give me the fucking fountain of beverage.
[309:23.15]Give me the fountain beverage.
[309:24.25]Give it to me.
[309:25.56]Everybody can relax.
[309:29.62]Everybody relax.
[309:31.02]Two steps forward, 15 steps back.
[309:40.62]You... You are making me so angry right now.
[309:43.40]You know, hold on.
[309:44.14]Cut the music for a second.
[309:45.38]Let me tell you something.
[309:47.20]I... Now that's an odd feeling.
[309:53.05]Hey, what gives?
[309:54.49]The fountain of youth water is gone.
[309:56.13]What?
[309:56.73]Have you been sneaking into my inventory again, Max?
[309:59.29]Don't blame me if you're having trouble holding your water.
[310:02.03]Why is it gone?
[310:02.51]Stupid magic water evaporates if it gets too far away from the fountain.
[310:05.72]That's damned inconvenient.
[310:15.48]Really?
[310:15.82]I can't just... So...
[310:25.67]So I can't... I cannot... Drink it and sprint.
[310:29.20]No, it's not going to work.
[310:32.68]I have to drink it outside.
[310:33.70]It's going to happen.
[310:40.49]Watch this.
[310:45.72]Try it, stupid.
[310:48.68]Give me a break.
[310:50.94]Try it.
[310:52.02]This is stupid.
[310:54.04]Alright, let's try it.
[310:55.86]Dumb.
[310:56.46]Dummy.
[311:09.73]I couldn't have known that was gonna happen.
[311:18.58]Thanks for trying it, dummy.
[311:20.69]Alright, so very obviously we have to be small and we have to get in there.
[311:23.41]And... I need to somehow... Gotta... Gotta... I gotta do something in here.
[311:32.51]What do I have to do in here?
[311:33.57]I mean, you've gotta gong in here.
[311:49.01]You've got a gong in here.
[311:50.21]This is not here for no reason?
[311:54.27]Is this the Jerm that told the truth about taking forever to overcomplicate every scenario when the simplest one's always the right answer?
[312:17.84]I didn't have an account named that long.
[312:19.73]What about the ashtray?
[312:20.73]Can I just like eat them?
[312:22.09]Stinkies has a no smoking unless you're Flint policy.
[312:25.08]Sounds a lot like their policy on homicides.
[312:37.40]Then our insurance rates go up again.
[312:43.08]Let's think of the facts.
[312:44.55]I've got the sandwich.
[312:45.69]I've got to make him laugh.
[312:47.93]I've got the basalt.
[312:49.97]I need to be young inside of here and get the kids menu, the kids meal.
[312:55.89]How do I become small in here?
[312:59.67]I can't bring the water here.
[313:02.18]There's a gong that's up here.
[313:03.96]It might just be there for a comedy purpose.
[313:13.76]Jerma, you okay?
[313:14.50]You sound irritated.
[313:15.40]No, I'm fine.
[313:22.50]Put the gong in the cup.
[313:31.77]Can I fill it with, like, other liquids?
[313:33.65]Can I bring any other liquid out?
[313:55.64]Boil the gong.
[314:01.23]Drink and then rush to stinky.
[314:02.53]I already tried that.
[314:09.67]Alright.
[314:10.79]Um... The passive fire.
[314:16.44]Ingredients?
[314:17.46]Kerosene, pepper spray, the hydrocapsaicin, and wasabi.
[314:25.79]How do I make you small?
[314:28.52]Can I... Can you eat something?
[314:31.96]Can I like cover the...
[314:56.62]Max has got to be small.
[314:58.88]And what the hell is that for?
[315:00.25]I still don't know what that's for.
[315:07.20]No, what is that for?
[315:08.46]Smoke?
[315:23.60]No, I know I can activate it by shooting it, but I don't know what I need to do with it.
[315:29.37]Something.
[315:29.75]I don't even know why I still have this.
[315:43.04]I'm stuck.
[315:44.16]I'm kind of stuck.
[315:44.90]I am.
[315:45.84]But... Let me just get this in here.
[316:09.56]The gong in Sibyl's is like this.
[316:12.06]No, it's not.
[316:12.66]It's like... Hold on.
[316:16.86]If this is stupid enough to work, I'll be surprised.
[316:20.06]But hold on a minute.
[316:39.68]Come on!
[316:40.42]I can't, like, take some of that goo and throw it on the gong?
[316:44.05]The red, like, portal goo?
[316:45.85]Shit, hold on.
[316:49.21]Gimme that.
[317:07.57]I can't like squeeze the mustard on it and turn it orange.
[317:23.38]Looks like somebody already had a slice.
[317:25.54]That explains all those ambulances this morning and the screaming.
[317:29.51]I can't.
[317:29.93]I got to be able to squeeze mustard on that shit.
[317:41.67]Dammit.
[317:42.17]Alright.
[317:42.67]Well, let me go... Uh-oh.
[317:50.80]Well, that was a long one.
[317:59.82]That was a very, very long one.
[318:01.38]Are we still, hopefully, alive still?
[318:07.85]Well, this would make three days in a row of bad, fucked up internet, so it is time to make another phone call.
[318:17.82]But I cannot do that tomorrow, so we're gonna have to deal with it tomorrow, too.
[318:22.28]Sorry.
[318:25.68]We have 10,500 drop frames.
[318:29.83]Not bad enough to turn the stream off, but annoying enough where it happens, right?
[318:40.05]It's definitely manageable.
[318:41.78]But, nah, it's not good enough.
[318:43.68]You're fixing it again.
[318:44.96]Cox.
[318:59.43]Is there something in here that I didn't do?
[319:03.93]Can I take something out of... Can I take the banang out?
[319:06.60]Can I drink something?
[319:08.08]It's the ocean ship's ceremonial feeding urn.
[319:13.04]Not happening.
[319:13.70]Dammit.
[319:21.44]What about this?
[319:22.50]I can't open this thing?
[319:23.47]Can't use it.
[319:25.93]Oh, for the love of God.
[319:41.40]What the fuck?
[319:43.28]There's another portal in here.
[319:47.05]There's a whole side of the cave I didn't see.
[319:48.97]Snail Trail.
[319:49.71]Well, that's red.
[319:50.35]Okay.
[319:50.67]Okay.
[320:11.88]That gong doesn't need to be painted I've got to paint a gong.
[320:16.48]I've got to paint the gong but red it's orange.
[320:19.86]It's not red I have to go paint that gong Yeah, but like this I have to paint the gong red
[320:45.82]No siree.
[320:46.96]Let's go see what it does.
[321:00.43]Alright, let's go paint it.
[321:03.81]That one's not red.
[321:17.21]that one this one's red that's red right this is red that's red oh it's red that's the bits of huge and it's red it's a big red that's the biggest red thing we've seen it's a huge and red are you stinky what oh
[321:50.31]Um, what are you guys doing?
[321:53.05]Red improves digestion.
[321:54.81]Don't try to argue with feng shui, Stinky.
[321:57.51]It's science.
[321:58.45]We can now activate and deactivate red.
[322:02.57]Activate red.
[322:05.35]I never really expected that to work.
[322:08.11]Ah, it pulls the biggest, reddest thing here.
[322:11.90]How was I able to connect those two?
[322:13.86]What?
[322:29.89]It's huge and red.
[322:32.42]That was a tough one.
[322:33.86]That was tricky.
[322:36.06]It's obvious.
[322:36.88]What?
[322:37.18]No, it's not.
[322:40.50]It's not that obvious.
[322:42.34]It's tricky.
[322:52.79]Colors.
[322:53.21]Yeah, but I didn't know this one was connected to a gong.
[322:55.51]How would I know that?
[322:56.41]Alright, let's do it.
[323:02.61]And I gotta go find like a snail with blood coming out of its ass or whatever it was.
[323:07.06]Give us the kid's special, please.
[323:09.02]Hello, Miss Stinky.
[323:10.46]What do you boys want?
[323:11.78]Do you have money to pay?
[323:13.60]Drop the attitude, lady.
[323:14.92]I'm the president's adorable nephew here for a visit.
[323:19.93]Well, since I know the president personally, I guess it's okay.
[323:24.09]We'll take a kid's meal.
[323:26.33]We'd like the special.
[323:28.93]We'd like the special.
[323:30.33]You're in luck, boys.
[323:31.85]I've got one already made.
[323:33.79]One basalt sandwich coming up.
[323:38.61]But we also want the kids' meal, too.
[323:41.27]Aren't you gonna cut the crusts off?
[323:43.21]I've, um, misplaced my knife.
[323:45.66]You probably left it in the real Stinky's body.
[323:48.48]It's an honest mistake.
[323:50.64]Oh, that's silly, you little rascals.
[323:54.52]Now, run along and play before I call child services.
[324:07.19]That is the kid's mill.
[324:17.62]I thought they were different things.
[324:30.32]Hey, look, we got you a mouth-watering basalt sandwich.
[324:33.92]Basalt?
[324:35.16]Hmm, it's been a while.
[324:37.54]What about the rabbity guy?
[324:38.86]Is he cool?
[324:39.92]More or less.
[324:41.12]Alright, quick, before my carvers get back.
[324:44.65]This is just drunk.
[324:51.89]Oh, man, that is some kind basalt.
[324:55.48]Dude, don't Bogart the sandwich.
[324:57.98]Oh, man.
[324:59.80]It's like I can taste colors.
[325:02.64]Get a load of Cheech over here, Max.
[325:04.46]He's lit up like an arsonist's birthday cake.
[325:06.99]No way, Sam.
[325:07.97]It's been like five seconds.
[325:09.43]He can't be that much of a lightweight.
[325:11.59]Oh, yeah?
[325:12.47]Watch.
[325:17.55]Sorry, sir.
[325:18.21]We just accidentally killed your puppy.
[325:20.93]You crack me up, little dude.
[325:27.65]Oh, whoa.
[325:29.33]Hey, you guys want to order a pizza?
[325:31.92]Really loud laugh.
[325:34.88]Well, what if we're like all dreaming now and what we think is a dream is really reality?
[325:40.06]That would explain why I'm always showing up at places with no clothes on.
[325:43.12]Make him laugh two or three times just to make sure.
[325:49.36]That's a pretty great lawnmower laugh.
[325:59.50]Starting him up.
[326:01.42]Alright, see you later.
[326:07.28]Let's go get that stalag!
[326:09.30]Tight.
[326:13.14]Stalactites are the ones on the ground.
[326:14.50]Stalactites are from the ceiling.
[326:16.22]And you can remember that because stalactite has to hold and has to stay on the ceiling.
[326:19.69]Stalactite.
[326:32.78]Wow, it's like I'm eight again.
[326:38.00]How old are you now?
[326:44.47]Make sure you get my good side, Sam.
[326:46.51]You have a good side?
[326:51.63]Look, over here.
[326:52.70]It's an image of the true high priest, Max.
[326:57.14]How'd that get there?
[326:58.74]Look just like him.
[327:00.34]It uncanny.
[327:01.72]That appear completely out of nowhere.
[327:04.73]Mighty feet, show us face of true high priest.
[327:11.96]Prophecies are fulfilled.
[327:13.94]The feet have spoken.
[327:16.08]True, High Priest has returned.
[327:18.78]People of the feet, all shall love me and despair.
[327:23.58]No time for that now, little buddy.
[327:25.24]High Priest, take rightful place on Ultar.
[327:29.86]So go in here.
[327:32.44]Save the day.
[327:34.80]We've got to get up there and stop that volcano.
[327:38.66]So wait.
[327:39.82]We still get to kill them now, yes?
[327:41.39]No!
[327:42.19]Now we deal with Impostor!
[327:47.95]That's... sad.
[327:50.75]Phony so-called high priest, what have you to say for sir?
[327:54.61]Yeah, who gives, Mr. Spatula?
[327:56.94]I thought we were pals.
[327:58.56]He say pals?
[328:00.30]Ha ha ha!
[328:01.44]Then he spit derisively!
[328:07.37]Cox bubble.
[328:22.74]No, he say.
[328:24.00]You think you won, Simon Max.
[328:26.70]You really just step in trap.
[328:29.32]I send triangle to summon you here.
[328:32.06]And you stupid primitives to waste your time.
[328:35.02]We not primitive.
[328:36.59]We have cell phone.
[328:39.03]The betrayal.
[328:39.63]You too late to stop volcano.
[328:42.21]Fascist oppressor Simon Max get herbal tea and foot rubs once and for all.
[328:47.61]That doesn't sound so bad.
[328:49.25]Is this thing going any faster?
[328:50.99]Now he's saying, that's not what I said at all.
[328:55.02]Me confused.
[328:56.34]Not herbal tea and foot robes, rain of fire and drowning magma.
[329:01.14]I always speak so-so.
[329:02.32]You should have taken the express pod.
[329:04.00]Yeah, this is taking a long time.
[329:05.34]Come, Salmon Max.
[329:07.34]Come to your doom.
[329:09.59]In my spectral form, I am invincible.
[329:11.99]Press the in case of emergency button.
[329:13.71]Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha.
[329:25.96]He's gonna be fine.
[329:30.46]He's underwater.
[329:31.28]The dude's underwater.
[329:32.92]He's gonna be alright.
[329:56.30]No time, Max.
[329:57.38]We're too late to stop the volcano.
[329:59.20]What do we do?
[330:00.54]What do we do?
[330:03.00]We press this emergency button.
[330:05.30]It says, in case of emergency.
[330:07.34]Press it, Sam.
[330:08.10]Press it.
[330:09.04]I suppose now's as good a time as any.
[330:17.07]I wonder what that did.
[330:18.45]What?
[330:19.45]Nothing more we can do here, Max.
[330:21.09]Let's go up top and check out the situation.
[330:23.31]What?
[330:25.19]Turn off the volcano.
[330:27.69]Like this.
[330:28.57]Alright, well we just... Okay, get it then.
[330:30.83]Let's go!
[330:31.25]Go!
[330:31.53]Go!
[330:31.79]Go!
[330:31.93]Come on!
[330:32.35]Hurry!
[330:33.57]With some pep in your step.
[330:36.73]Alright, what did that do up here?
[330:45.06]We need to... Let's see what's going on outside.
[331:00.00]Bloody-nosed Euclid doing the Eucharist on a nitro-burning catamaran.
[331:03.38]That's the second biggest Bermuda Triangle I've ever seen.
[331:06.88]Seems to be spinning out of control, too.
[331:09.97]Now this one's getting up.
[331:12.59]That one went inside of that one.
[331:15.53]I fail to see how this is helpful in an emergency.
[331:18.35]This is it.
[331:19.13]The volcano is about to explode.
[331:23.49]Bogus.
[331:25.01]Help us, Sam and Max.
[331:28.77]I'll try.
[331:29.33]But hold on, I forgot to get the thing that fell.
[331:41.78]Run!
[331:46.72]This thing.
[331:49.04]High Priest Medallion.
[331:49.80]It's the official signet of the Ocean Chimp's High Priest.
[331:53.86]Don't I get to wear it?
[331:55.32]We don't have a chain long enough to fit around your enormous head, chum.
[331:58.68]Okay, anything else?
[331:59.76]Sock, crown.
[332:10.97]You look right.
[332:13.23]Any more snail trail?
[332:15.07]Alright, so I've got coin.
[332:22.74]Conk.
[332:26.14]Well, I did that.
[332:26.88]So now, let's see.
[332:27.86]So I have...
[332:30.15]Alright, hold on.
[332:37.14]Cup of the Snail Trail?
[332:38.18]I- maybe I- let's see.
[332:45.32]This one's pink.
[332:53.93]So we got- that's- I can act- definitely have to do something with the one in the back.
[333:09.66]Now, what do I have to do with this?
[333:16.32]May I make pink, maybe?
[333:17.72]Hold on.
[333:32.43]Can I scoop it up?
[333:33.33]I mean, I need to make pink.
[333:43.49]no way nah I still have to use it okay well I have a red coin red and blue makes pink red and green red and red makes red and white
[334:28.17]Well, I'm just going by previous logic that we had to paint the gong a different color.
[334:36.84]Maybe I have to paint the gong a different color now.
[334:46.44]Oh, it's a fucking callback to the beginning of the game.
[334:50.43]Hold on.
[334:57.13]Watch this.
[335:15.80]He's going to stop.
[335:23.34]What?
[335:24.63]Did that not work?
[335:27.09]I hope there's nobody on the other side of that triangle.
[335:29.59]I thought I had to do way more than that.
[335:31.61]You said it, dude bro.
[335:33.63]You've done it.
[335:34.53]You've broken the prophecy.
[335:36.33]You've saved our ancient civilization from destruction.
[335:42.71]You guys like think I'm just sitting with my face into the other monitor going, just where's the answer?
[336:04.85]I have to, like, click on the screen, but I have to look at the screen.
[336:07.63]No, no, I have to look over here the whole time.
[336:09.97]Yes, I got it.
[336:10.97]Thank God.
[336:12.13]I guess we just sit here for another few thousand years.
[336:16.81]That's what I do.
[336:19.41]That sucks.
[336:37.96]Where's the music?
[336:48.35]Imagine talking over the ending.
[336:50.77]I can hear it just fine.
[336:57.24]No, I didn't mute anything.
[337:10.07]Is this supposed to be playing music?
[337:13.43]It's alright.
[337:13.79]Don't worry.
[337:14.57]I'll show it again.
[337:29.15]Maybe we lost the... The window is... Yeah, the window is on.
[337:48.37]The music stops if you take too long.
[337:51.23]Take too long doing what?
[337:52.73]The episode?
[337:56.50]I took like, I don't know, what was that?
[337:57.54]Like an hour and 20 minutes?
[338:05.16]Isn't the general time for these like an hour to two hours?
[338:07.22]Alright, Charlie!
[338:08.06]Charlie!
[338:23.81]Sorry, I had to stop talking.
[338:35.79]Here we go.
[338:37.37]You guys want to see the ending?
[338:58.56]No, see you guys in five minutes.
[339:10.86]I hope there's nobody on the other side of that triangle.
[339:13.23]I don't care.
[339:14.85]You said it, dude bro.
[339:16.97]You've done it.
[339:17.87]You've broken the prophecy.
[339:19.67]You've saved our ancient civilization from destruction.
[339:24.23]Helene!
[339:26.02]So, sweet thing, now that's over with, let's say you and I find somewhere private to get sedimentary.
[339:33.99]Yeah, I think we should spend some time apart.
[339:37.53]Your loss.
[339:38.72]Can I get a ride with you guys?
[339:40.54]Our portal back home is gone.
[339:41.98]We're gonna have to swim!
[339:44.94]Do you float, Mr. Lincoln?
[339:46.46]Only one way to find out.
[339:48.42]I get to ride on his dewlap!
[339:50.23]You can only call that once we get in the water.
[339:53.33]That sucks.
[339:53.97]Okay, so everyone was so upset that I spoke over the last four sentences of the game.
[340:02.73]Let's see if we have to do it again.
[340:27.65]Again with the music.
[340:28.47]It's the same.
[340:29.13]I'll put it on YouTube.
[340:30.09]Here.
[340:34.46]Now I gotta do it again because the music's not there.
[340:58.41]Can I get it?
[340:59.55]No, this is Rick and Morty's ending credits.
[341:07.32]Alright.
[341:08.52]That's it.
[341:10.40]That is it for tonight.
[341:11.42]Sam & Max Episode 2, Season 2.
[341:24.17]I will be back tomorrow.
[341:29.23]Tomorrow we're gonna do something different.
[341:32.35]Probably should put this up, right?
[341:44.67]Will you play blood?
[341:46.29]Fresh, what is blood?
[341:47.83]Fresh supply.
[341:55.05]Am I going to finish Season 2?
[341:56.01]Oh yeah, definitely.
[341:57.73]Just not tomorrow.
[341:59.19]Tomorrow we're going to do something different.
[342:07.87]Remaster?
[342:08.37]Oh, okay.
[342:15.22]This is now a Sam and Max only stream.
[342:17.40]I think it's great.
[342:23.48]But tomorrow we're gonna do MS-DOS games.
[342:26.68]We're gonna do... Archive.org Is SimEarth in there?
[342:43.68]I don't know.
[342:44.88]There's like 4,500 games.
[342:45.80]That's a lot.
[342:54.18]To be honest, that sounds like shit.
[342:56.38]Well, you don't have to go.
[342:57.92]You don't have to watch tomorrow.
[343:00.80]You know, there's a thing in the top right corner of your screen.
[343:04.14]You can just click it.
[343:08.85]It's not that hard.
[343:13.83]But, uh, I'm gonna pee.
[343:14.95]I'll be right back.
[343:19.13]And we will do the credits.
[343:20.75]The good old credits.
[343:27.16]After I piss.
[343:28.40]So technically, we'll be right back.
[343:34.11]See you very soon.
[344:04.04]you
[344:38.92]Thank you.
[345:13.88]you
[345:59.65]Hello.
[346:05.51]Okay.
[346:10.72]Why was this closed?
[346:17.69]Did my Streamlabs update?
[346:23.93]It's odd.
[346:24.51]This feels incomplete.
[346:45.10]Maybe it's not.
[347:05.68]Wait, chat is pissed?
[347:07.16]Why?
[347:08.80]Why is chat mad at me?
[347:11.80]What do you mean chat's mad?
[347:13.35]Why?
[347:13.65]Why?
[347:14.01]Why?
[347:14.25]For what?
[347:16.71]What did I do?
[347:17.21]What happened?
[347:27.16]You know.
[347:29.26]What?
[347:29.64]What are you talking about?
[347:40.08]What are we mad about tonight, lads?
[347:49.80]It's not funny when you mean to chat with- Mean to the person that- Mean to the one person that told me that they said my stream was gonna be shit tomorrow?
[347:57.72]What?
[347:57.96]That's one guy!
[348:01.33]Who was rude, so I was rude back!
[348:04.65]What?
[348:09.12]What are you talking about?
[348:10.13]This is copypasta bullshit!
[348:24.46]What would Jesus do?
[348:25.42]He'd say, hey!
[348:27.32]Cut it out, asshole!
[348:30.11]That's what he would say.
[348:43.44]I don't think Jesus would know English.
[348:45.14]He might.
[348:54.85]They're copy-posting, but when I said it, I meant it.
[348:58.79]What?
[349:00.37]What are you talking about?
[349:01.43]No, this is just bullshit.
[349:11.20]That one guy has now permanent bias.
[349:21.96]I'm permanently getting T. One guy has so much power.
[349:36.68]When I look over here and I say, here's for the fourth stream in a row this week.
[349:41.91]Hey, I had this idea of playing, like, MS-DOS games.
[349:45.20]Nah, that's gonna suck.
[349:46.60]That stream sucks.
[349:48.76]Like, what do you want me to do?
[349:50.44]Be like, yes, of course.
[349:51.51]It will suck.
[349:52.45]You've got a great idea.
[349:53.85]Good, thank you.
[349:56.21]What?
[349:58.76]What did he do?
[349:59.26]What?
[350:17.71]Don't acknowledge the one guy.
[350:19.18]I mean, I'm partially kidding when I acknowledge that.
[350:25.16]But I am gonna... I'm gonna fight back!
[350:27.16]I'm a fighter!
[350:31.36]I lost in the first round.
[350:35.83]When I got in that fight in high school.
[350:39.37]First round.
[350:39.99]Got KO'd.
[350:43.95]I got the wrong thing up here.
[350:51.00]And then after that I took a vow to never, ever fight anybody ever again.
[351:03.65]Back in 86.
[351:03.97]That was the smartest thing I've ever done.
[351:23.64]But anyways... Yes, I will see you tomorrow.
[351:43.51]What games are we gonna play?
[351:44.49]That's for up to you to decide.
[351:46.11]Because I'm gonna turn on smart clicks.
[351:57.24]So, you'll be able to decide that.
[351:59.10]I know there's a lot of things on there that I might not be able to stream.
[352:04.10]So, gonna have to be careful with that one.
[352:17.17]You gotta get it right.
[352:20.57]But, uh, let's go back to earlier.
[352:23.63]We are, where are we here?
[352:29.48]We had $5 from the English alphabet.
[352:31.66]Thank you for the $5.
[352:32.83]Appreciate it.
[352:36.77]And right now, CyanTF2, five community subs.
[352:44.85]Really appreciate that.
[352:45.50]Thank you.
[352:46.30]Right at the end here.
[352:50.40]Germakin, my mom got a shout out from Mother's Day.
[352:52.28]Her name is Kim.
[352:54.04]Yeah, happy Mother's Day.
[352:55.94]To Kim, the English alphabet's mother.
[352:58.83]There you go.
[353:11.99]Happy Mother's Day.
[353:13.45]Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers, right?
[353:23.20]But thank you.
[353:24.50]Thank you to Jack.
[353:26.50]Jack gave 14 bucks earlier in the stream.
[353:28.66]Thank you, Jack.
[353:31.18]AdventureMFDan, five community subs.
[353:33.00]Thank you, Dan.
[353:41.06]Two very generous back-to-back community subs.
[353:44.56]Thanks, guys.
[353:46.24]Thank you, Cyan, and thank you, AdventureMFDan.
[353:51.34]Uh, but Jack, uh, JackTheMac gave 14 bucks.
[353:54.93]Anyone thinks Jerma looks like the Golden Company leader in Game of Thrones?
[354:03.67]Uh... I feel like people say I look like a lot of people.
[354:09.79]Well, I don't know about that one.
[354:23.17]He's a little more full in the face than I am.
[354:32.40]But thank you for the 15 bucks here.
[354:35.84]Really appreciate it, Jack.
[354:36.64]Thank you.
[354:43.00]And now Mr. Comcast coming in with three bucks.
[354:45.18]What do you got first today, Mr. Comcast?
[354:52.27]Thanks for the three dollars.
[354:53.03]Hey, Jerma John, Comcast here, just letting you know.
[354:56.31]That I saw you at Nando's last night.
[354:59.85]I wanted to come say hi, but you were shouting profanities at the 16-year-old busboy because Kim only let you use the kid's menu.
[355:07.15]I found it awkward when you DDT'd the chef through table and then started harassing an elderly couple about how you'd kicked their ass in the Jerma Rumble.
[355:14.82]It got so bad that the police showed up, but you escaped through the back door while carrying a box of Cheez-Its.
[355:26.04]Why do I always have to like be this like insane person that's hurting people and breaking things?
[355:36.00]There's never like a copypasta here of like, I saw Jerma out at Wendy's and he high-fived the guy in the window and gave him a $100 tip and then turned around and winked at me.
[355:51.75]And in the back was a bunch of puppies that he was saving.
[355:55.33]It's never that.
[355:55.93]It's always like I break shit and hurt people.
[356:03.03]Because they're telling the true stories.
[356:04.49]Yeah, there you go.
[356:08.37]That's unrealistic.
[356:12.62]You wouldn't do those things.
[356:30.65]Uh, thank you, I-zek?
[356:34.35]I-zek?
[356:36.25]I-X-E-K?
[356:37.35]Isaac.
[356:38.58]Thanks for the five bucks.
[356:39.34]Bit late, but here's five dollars for the 10Ds bit.
[356:42.24]Got a good laugh out of me on an otherwise depressing birthday.
[356:44.76]Well, happy birthday, that's... Oh, there's the coffee faster, there it is.
[356:56.95]thank you the five dollars uh I we kind of were just talking about a random bunch of I hope you thought it was funny glad you did hope you have a better uh hope you have a better birthday sorry to hear that it wasn't very good happy birthday though combine thanks to the three bucks here you are clown
[357:24.98]Uh, honk honk, honk honk, right?
[357:28.69]I didn't even do it right.
[357:34.03]But thank you.
[357:34.41]Thank you, Zach, or Zake again, for the 250.
[357:36.41]Well, pretty cool that you have a black belt in karate.
[357:39.70]I didn't know that they use hockey pads in karate too.
[357:42.28]P.S.
[357:42.40]Have you ever thought about doing morning streams for EU boys?
[357:46.72]After yesterday, I thought this one might have been a little, like, an hour or two early, but no, I just wasn't able to do it.
[357:53.79]But not really planned on it, unfortunately.
[357:56.81]I know there's a lot of people that want it, but I have to be ready to stream and in a streaming mood, and it doesn't really happen that often in the morning.
[358:08.12]And for me to do an EU-friendly stream, I have to start at at least, you know, 9, 10 o'clock in the morning.
[358:12.90]It was not that highly energetic in the morning.
[358:25.51]But they will happen randomly from time to time, like you see them already a couple times.
[358:35.90]Thank you, Ranzor, for the three bucks.
[358:38.68]No messages, just three dollars.
[358:40.36]Thank you, Ranzor.
[358:42.26]Bimber, ten thanks for the five dollars.
[358:43.58]Hey Jeremy, I would eat my toes if you played No One Lives Forever 2.
[358:47.65]A spy in harm's way.
[358:48.95]It's a classic game that I think you would love and be entertaining to watch.
[358:56.96]um I've I've never heard of it but I'd admit maybe if I think it's something that's fun and worth streaming I don't know we had a lot of feet on stream today yeah there was
[359:23.02]JermaLiedAboutTacoBell thanks to the 250.
[359:25.58]Megamind for Jerma Rumble.
[359:32.64]Good old Megamind.
[359:43.59]No, Megamind's... I'll get in trouble.
[359:46.43]Somebody will sue me.
[359:50.63]You never played it?
[359:51.39]It's... Look at the Tricycle Mine level.
[359:55.63]Okay.
[359:58.01]Bought $50 from Balla Koala earlier.
[359:59.95]Thank you so much, Balla Koala.
[360:03.19]We touched upon it already, but that's a lot.
[360:04.73]Thank you.
[360:06.63]Ferordian Weapon thanks for the $250.
[360:08.01]Since the Easter Island heads aren't paying up, I will in their stead.
[360:11.31]Happy Friday.
[360:12.03]Happy Friday.
[360:13.93]Thank you.
[360:14.77]Thank you.
[360:29.16]C4G.
[360:31.22]Thanks to 250.
[360:31.73]I don't know what message to include, so here's a picture of my cat.
[360:33.99]Let's see.
[360:34.31]Oh, that's a great cat.
[360:41.23]What's on the collar?
[360:42.02]Is it a flower?
[360:44.28]That's a pretty great cat.
[360:56.53]Somebody said, you ever just sniff your monitor?
[360:58.37]No, never.
[361:05.23]That was earlier.
[361:06.75]It was a bit message, but I... I've never done that before.
[361:18.96]FreudianWeapon, thanks for the $2.50.
[361:21.12]Don't listen to the rude guys.
[361:22.54]Your streams are always fun.
[361:23.74]No, I'm going to fight back.
[361:33.89]Now, I know people are fucking around 95% of the time.
[361:36.17]But I'm, yeah, I'm dead.
[361:41.06]If we're gonna have a back and forth scenario here, I'm gonna fight back.
[361:50.89]You can hear him flexing.
[361:52.49]Like, fucking muscles are just exploding.
[362:05.77]I'm serious.
[362:10.16]Chat rumble.
[362:18.39]You wanna hear me flex?
[362:24.07]Just popped up.
[362:26.57]Try it again.
[362:31.16]That one... That one hit the ceiling.
[362:43.91]No, most of the time, you guys realize that whenever somebody, if I say something where I'm like, oh, fucking Ray, what the fuck, fuck you, I'm usually just fucking around.
[362:55.32]We have all kinds of in-channel kind of back and forths that are fun, right?
[363:13.37]What do you want me to say?
[363:14.47]I can't, like, pretend.
[363:27.36]You hurt my feelings.
[363:28.32]What about my feelings?
[363:37.12]You took it too far.
[363:39.26]What?
[363:42.75]I spent the whole last 10 minutes of the stream having people tell me how stupid I was.
[363:47.31]How dumb of a person I am.
[363:50.51]That was like the last 20 minutes of the- that was actually about 6 hours of the stream.
[363:58.91]So, wait, I'm allowed to take the harassment here?
[364:01.32]Huh?
[364:11.74]When I say one thing.
[364:13.12]In like a joking manner.
[364:33.36]All of a sudden I'm like the Joker from Batman.
[364:50.22]I get to be the one guy sometimes.
[365:07.06]Come on.
[365:08.32]You gotta give me a little bit, like... You gotta give me a little bit of slack.
[365:24.11]We fuck around here a lot.
[365:26.79]But half the shit that is said in this stream would get you banned somewhere else.
[365:30.19]And you know it.
[365:34.15]Come on.
[365:47.72]So, we have a pretty light atmosphere here.
[366:01.29]I say love shouldn't get banned for it.
[366:18.72]Be the bigger person in any room.
[366:21.09]Oh, I get it.
[366:21.85]See?
[366:22.25]Alright.
[366:22.57]So, alright.
[366:23.91]Look at that.
[366:24.85]Look, it's being spanned right now.
[366:27.21]look do you see this you see like what what that's it and I'm at zero
[366:52.09]We're in the middle of talking about, like, shit-talking, and I look over and I see a shit-talk coffee pasta.
[367:04.30]You guys are on point, I'll give you that.
[367:17.02]Joke was so good it fucking killed him.
[367:20.68]But anyways.
[367:37.73]Let us move on.
[367:50.98]The copypasta is so elaborate.
[367:54.36]People could come up with some crazy shit.
[368:03.54]But we had... Let's... Almost at the end here.
[368:07.11]We had $10 from AllMew4.
[368:09.26]Thank you, AllMew.
[368:15.94]Hey, Jerma, I was out with my girlfriend the other night at a bar.
[368:18.12]We were pleasantly surprised to see you, Kim, and Shito there, but you seemed a little off.
[368:23.12]I saw that you ordered enough PBR to make yourself almost pass out and even be sick.
[368:27.22]We didn't want to go up and say anything because we saw Shito and Kim carrying you home as you stumbled and a drunk fit.
[368:34.23]I just want to ask, what's the deal with you lying so much?
[368:36.27]I really want you to be a better person.
[368:46.05]Thank you for the $10, I appreciate it.
[368:49.99]I'm drinking PBR tomorrow.
[368:52.99]Mark my words, I will drink that gross liquid.
[369:02.86]JermaLiedAboutTacoBell thanks to the $2.50.
[369:04.92]I saw Jerma out at a Wendy's, he high-fived the cashier and then winked at me.
[369:08.96]He was super nice to everyone right until he pulled his pants down and shit on the floor.
[369:18.41]Son of Jenova, thanks for the three dollars.
[369:20.18]Hi, I love you.
[369:23.08]Watch this, please.
[369:23.90]It's probably what's going to happen to you tomorrow.
[369:28.32]Hey, what are you going to do?
[369:29.68]Hey, shh, don't tell him.
[369:31.93]Hey, don't tell him.
[369:35.31]Don't tell him.
[369:49.83]I'm not allowed to do that.
[369:51.41]Come on.
[370:06.71]Nobody said you can't.
[370:20.12]It probably is what's gonna happen, but I'll be on top of it, don't worry.
[370:23.65]I'm gonna flex my fucking tiny muscles.
[370:31.40]Why are you so mean to us?
[370:32.72]Abnard!
[370:34.00]Abnard, what?
[370:36.26]I know this is just a di- I know, everyone's just fucking with me now.
[371:18.72]Where's the sour place?
[371:19.42]Come on.
[371:19.94]There it is.
[371:20.40]That's what I was waiting for.
[371:28.18]Thank you, though.
[371:29.60]I will be on top of it.
[371:30.42]Don't worry.
[371:30.72]Hey, uh, Shinoda.
[371:33.49]Thanks for the $2.50.
[371:34.15]Hey, Jerma, are you going to join the Vine slash charity stream?
[371:36.43]It'd be a good time for Vine Wrestle versus Jerma Rumble with Joel.
[371:41.55]I don't know.
[371:42.69]That's a really good question.
[371:44.38]I'll have to... I don't really have an answer for you.
[371:50.34]But it's a great charity.
[371:52.14]They do awesome stuff.
[371:55.36]They do it every year, right?
[371:56.66]So, I mean, maybe we'll see.
[371:58.50]I can't give you an answer.
[371:59.38]I don't want to tell you that's going to happen and then it doesn't, right?
[372:05.99]But thank you for the $2.50.
[372:06.61]Definitely something to look into, right?
[372:11.12]Mr. Comcast, thanks for the $3.
[372:13.20]And let's run the credits on stream.
[372:19.43]We had a lot of community subs today.
[372:22.52]Like, at least 20 to 30, probably, community subs.
[372:24.58]Thank you, guys.
[372:34.41]Okay, why don't we run a... Here they come.
[372:43.21]All the new subs, all the old subs, you guys are awesome.
[372:44.78]Thank you so much!
[372:53.28]Reload the page to fix the mute.
[372:54.66]I hear that all the time.
[372:55.80]I don't know.
[372:58.51]I've never picked up on that.
[373:00.17]Maybe it's when the internet kicks out and it causes it to fuck up.
[373:03.29]It's weird.
[373:05.71]But thank you, everybody.
[373:07.37]Jermal lied about Minecraft VR.
[373:08.97]There's the original one.
[373:12.06]Original Minecraft VR lie.
[373:16.52]But I did play it.
[373:21.54]Mr. Comcast, thanks for $3, Comcast.
[373:23.78]Hey, John Comcast, just letting you know that I saw you last night at Six Flags.
[373:27.11]Okay.
[373:27.81]You were screaming and shouting at the 16-year-old ride attendant for not letting you on the teacups because you were under the height limit.
[373:33.79]Found it awkward when you didn't.
[373:35.51]When you DDT'd the park supervisor through a hot dog stand and stole some candy off a 5-year-old child that was sitting on a park bench.
[373:41.29]It got so bad that the police showed up, but you stole a Captain Crunch mascot outfit and escaped.
[373:46.53]I'm glad I got away.
[373:52.26]In this fake story, it's not real, but the good thing I hit-manned out of there.
[373:57.02]In the Captain Crunch uniform.
[374:01.34]Finally, the Sandwich.
[374:03.54]Thank you, the Sandwich for $2.50.
[374:06.81]Jerma, I wanted to say that I hope you know that at least 98% of us love you and we know that you're messing around.
[374:11.72]Have a good night.
[374:12.26]Thanks for helping me get through the semester with your kind personality.
[374:15.36]I know I'm messing around, but if people think I'm not messing around and then they get mad at me for messing around, but then people mess around with me all the time, then it's a circle I gotta close.
[374:41.50]I don't think anyone actually gets mad.
[374:43.02]People do, though.
[374:44.34]They do.
[374:47.21]You can't tell that we're joking is easy.
[374:48.81]Yeah, but you can.
[374:49.93]You can tell.
[374:50.71]I know when shit is just a joke and I know when people are actually irritated about something.
[375:09.46]Sorry to tell if someone is angry through text.
[375:11.84]Yeah, but you can... You can tell.
[375:14.14]Ban him.
[375:26.53]No, you don't get banned in this channel for, like, making fun of the streamer.
[375:31.32]That's what I was referring to.
[375:34.90]There are a lot of scenarios where if you talk shit to the person streaming, they'll just be like, bye.
[375:44.18]We have like a joke kind of here about it.
[375:55.09]But the streamer can't get banned from making fun of the chat.
[375:57.67]No, because this is the streamer's house.
[376:11.45]You're in my house.
[376:16.52]He's gonna get evicted.
[376:17.54]No one's getting evicted!
[376:27.87]Refusing to show Otto's feet.
[376:30.55]You've seen him already.
[376:31.37]You've seen it already.
[376:36.33]But, finally, before the stream ends, I got those tendies with the honey mustard sauce.
[376:39.97]Good.
[376:41.31]I hope it's fucking delish.
[376:48.80]As always, thanks for watching, everybody.
[376:50.02]See you tomorrow.
[376:54.30]Where's your restroom?
[376:55.05]I don't have one.
[376:56.61]We pee outside.
[377:03.73]That was a lot of fun.
[377:04.43]I'd say I have access to great.
[377:05.85]I had a lot of fun tonight.
[377:18.80]Can you do... You cracked me up, little buddy.
[377:20.32]Is Elmo Thanos doing a Sam impression?
[377:23.66]I don't think I can do that.
[377:27.06]Am I going to do season three?
[377:28.50]I don't know.
[377:31.54]I don't know.
[377:40.26]Once Season 2 is over, I'll see if I want to keep going.
[377:45.96]After Season 2, I might stop Sam & Max for a little while, just to do some other things.
[377:50.98]Because it's been taking up at least one or two streams a week.
[377:54.90]The last couple weeks have been Sam & Max, so maybe I'll put it on the shelf for a few weeks.
[378:02.21]But we're going to do at least Season 2 completely.
[378:10.15]And we'll see you after that.
[378:10.87]We'll go from there.
[378:13.51]I'll see you tomorrow.
[378:16.35]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[378:18.92]Good night.
[378:20.16]Goodbye.
[378:22.00]And I'm going to feed everybody in Stream Legends.
[378:23.80]I hope you're ready.
[378:24.38]Here it comes.
[378:35.02]Take care, everybody.
[378:35.76]See you real soon.
[378:39.32]Like tomorrow.
[378:42.08]Goodnight, guys.
[378:43.78]Bye-bye.
