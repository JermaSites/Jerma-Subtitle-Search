[00:01.25]Stop.
[00:02.37]How you doing?
[00:04.59]How you been?
[00:05.68]How's your family?
[00:06.34]How's your father?
[00:06.84]How's your mother?
[00:07.28]How are your kids?
[00:09.64]Good?
[00:10.08]Good.
[00:10.62]Good to hear.
[00:13.96]Crack open a fresh beer.
[00:18.64]Okay.
[00:23.33]Early.
[00:23.67]Now gift 2,000 subs.
[00:25.39]That's not part of the deal.
[00:28.00]That's not part of the deal.
[00:29.28]I said if I was even one minute after 2 o'clock.
[00:37.00]I said I was going to be early.
[00:38.98]If I wasn't early, I was going to gift a thousand subs.
[00:41.56]And this is 30 minutes early.
[00:44.14]Just about 30 minutes early.
[00:45.43]Something like that.
[00:53.69]I do have something very, very quick to say, though, while people trickle in.
[00:57.63]Very, very important stuff that I want everyone to pay attention to, so listen up, if you could.
[01:04.43]Sonic is the number one movie in the world.
[01:07.85]It's the funniest movie of the year.
[01:11.58]Critics and audiences agree, Sonic is the funniest movie in America.
[01:16.90]Sonic the Hedgehog, rated BG.
[01:20.91]Critics agree, Sonic is the funniest movie ever made.
[01:25.21]Audiences say, Sonic is the funniest movie of the year.
[01:28.11]You know how many fucking times I've had to hear that?
[01:35.45]It's burned into my brain.
[01:36.47]I've heard it so many times.
[01:37.35]I keep hearing it and I'm not even trying to.
[01:45.34]Stop watching TV.
[01:46.36]I can't.
[01:47.64]Sonic is the number one movie of the year.
[01:49.95]It worked.
[01:50.29]They got me.
[01:58.81]I laughed.
[01:59.47]Yeah.
[01:59.91]Yeah.
[02:00.87]Sonic is the number one movie in America.
[02:03.99]It's the funniest movie of the year.
[02:07.05]Critics and audiences agree.
[02:08.91]On Rotten Tomatoes.
[02:11.01]They do that shit now.
[02:12.11]They start talking about Rotten Tomatoes.
[02:15.45]Dave L. from Rotten Tomatoes says, Okay, let's go.
[02:45.04]Are you using a voice changer?
[02:46.72]Nah, what?
[02:48.02]I don't do that.
[02:52.79]Oh, we got a wink.
[02:54.01]Real quick, we got a wink.
[02:58.79]Does it have a camera setup?
[03:00.51]Oh shit, I don't even have my camera setup.
[03:03.54]Two winks, what?
[03:04.62]Oh shit, that is two winks.
[03:07.46]Get him out now.
[03:12.55]He's disabling the voice changer.
[03:14.25]I've heard him in real life.
[03:15.29]He always sounds like that.
[03:20.01]It's the, it's the, it's the funniest movie of the year.
[03:23.25]10 winks now.
[03:32.62]I can't, I have, I can't stop doing it.
[03:35.62]I'll probably, you know, that's, that's going to be what's going to happen today.
[03:37.48]I'll do it like 30 more times.
[03:38.22]I'm sorry.
[03:44.78]Welcome to black and white.
[03:45.58]Oh, I've got a wink.
[03:46.38]I forgot.
[03:51.89]Two distinct winks.
[03:59.69]10,000 points equals funny voice.
[04:01.17]No, I'm not doing... I'm not going to replace winks with something else that I have to say or do.
[04:08.54]We're going to make some cool channel point stuff.
[04:12.32]You'll see.
[04:13.96]No brace today.
[04:14.98]Yeah, I'm trying to loosen up a little bit.
[04:18.14]I've been a little tight.
[04:20.07]So I don't want to put a bunch of weight on me and press it in.
[04:26.87]I want to be a little loose today.
[04:29.41]But we're going to do black and white too, as you see.
[04:32.77]We left off last night.
[04:34.29]I want to play until I'm kind of done.
[04:36.47]I'm still having a good time.
[04:37.29]I think it's still fun.
[04:39.79]Where's the audio?
[04:43.42]Why is there no audio?
[04:47.22]Hold on a second.
[04:47.82]What the fuck is going on here?
[04:49.34]Can you guys hear this?
[04:50.56]I don't hear anything.
[04:52.76]Oh, it's because the game is paused, right?
[04:55.40]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:56.38]Okay, you're right.
[05:03.15]Oh, there it is.
[05:05.47]There it is.
[05:06.03]Okay.
[05:06.77]So, if you want to get some zoom out here, you can see what we've been doing.
[05:13.90]This is Murius.
[05:16.42]Growing up big and strong.
[05:17.62]If you missed last night, Murius beat the absolute shit out of somebody.
[05:26.41]Murius has a bunch of new fighting techniques.
[05:31.41]Is he planting flowers?
[05:32.43]Who's doing the flowers?
[05:33.19]I mean, that's not one of the fighting techniques, but that's still pretty sick.
[05:37.96]Look at that dance.
[05:45.26]Are people pretending to like this?
[05:46.84]Oh, that's a sick wedding dance.
[05:54.42]No, they do like it.
[05:55.20]They love it.
[06:02.27]I love them.
[06:03.83]I'm a bit hungry.
[06:06.21]Well, eat something.
[06:06.95]Here, eat this.
[06:10.61]Yeah, if you just caught the stream today and you didn't catch yesterday's,
[06:15.64]We're about... Eat it.
[06:17.16]Why are you afraid of grain?
[06:19.12]What's wrong with you?
[06:20.88]What?
[06:27.11]What's the skull?
[06:28.27]Uh, that means somebody's dead.
[06:31.07]Here, eat.
[06:33.39]Eat this.
[06:33.85]If you're hungry, please.
[06:35.85]Eat it.
[06:38.45]Eat it.
[06:39.83]It's good.
[06:40.35]I'm fine.
[06:41.03]You just said you were hungry.
[06:49.75]Broccoli.
[06:50.19]I don't like broccoli.
[06:52.87]Holy shit, that face.
[06:54.53]Alright, fine.
[07:00.34]Fine, do whatever you want with it.
[07:01.50]Alright, I gotta take over two more towns by force.
[07:06.17]I'm doing pretty well.
[07:07.39]Look at my city.
[07:07.93]We've got the development over here.
[07:09.99]We've got a little town this way.
[07:11.91]We've got some development this way.
[07:13.12]We've got some development over here.
[07:14.28]We've got a couple more developments.
[07:15.46]We have some developing over here.
[07:18.06]The idea is I need to spread my influence.
[07:19.52]We're going to build up this way.
[07:21.26]I just took this town.
[07:25.52]And I think it's time to take another one.
[07:27.54]What's above here?
[07:28.93]Oh, shit.
[07:29.31]Are there people here?
[07:31.99]Yeah, this is mine.
[07:32.87]This is mine.
[07:33.35]I need citizens.
[07:36.38]Does anybody live here?
[07:36.94]No, nobody lives here.
[07:40.72]Okay.
[07:43.37]I'm going to start building towns.
[07:49.29]Actually, I want... You guys take a walk over here.
[07:51.43]You take this town, too.
[07:57.67]That one's pretty far away, but it'll give me some more influence.
[08:01.08]Remember, that's my house.
[08:03.50]Well, it's... Sorry, what you meant to say was, it's my house.
[08:09.59]This is my house now.
[08:14.07]But that's what's happening.
[08:15.53]No, it's mine.
[08:15.93]No, that's actually, it's mine.
[08:18.03]It's mine now, because I'm going to get it.
[08:19.51]It's mine.
[08:19.99]Can I just take this one, too?
[08:22.67]Maybe I'll take this one first.
[08:23.55]Yeah, I'll take this one first.
[08:27.34]Wait, he's got an army over here.
[08:28.32]No, no, no, don't... That's not that big of an army.
[08:31.28]That army sucks.
[08:31.90]Take it.
[08:32.52]Take this.
[08:35.48]I'm gonna send Murius up here, too.
[08:36.59]Where's the, uh, archers?
[08:41.43]Why aren't the archers on a flag?
[08:43.31]Where's the archers flag?
[08:51.75]Why is this going so fast?
[08:56.73]Oh, the archers are already on the way down to the town.
[08:58.86]This is perfect.
[09:03.48]Perfect.
[09:04.66]Alright, Murius, I need you.
[09:06.50]You have to start to spread some influence here.
[09:09.02]Come with me.
[09:13.72]And then we're going to make new base of operations up here.
[09:17.25]This would be perfect.
[09:17.89]Alright, well here comes some resistance.
[09:26.23]You know what to do, Murius.
[09:27.83]Get fucking angry.
[09:38.06]They think... Oh, they're archers.
[09:40.14]They're archers.
[09:40.54]Alright, get in.
[09:41.02]Get in.
[09:41.28]Go in.
[09:45.29]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:46.11]This is important.
[09:47.07]Go.
[09:47.35]Attack, attack, attack.
[09:51.67]They'll just stop picking everybody up.
[09:54.08]Attack.
[09:56.96]Just kill them.
[09:58.64]Mirius, get up here.
[10:06.29]Good.
[10:07.01]Good.
[10:07.23]They all leveled up.
[10:07.81]Nice.
[10:08.07]Alright.
[10:08.71]Come on.
[10:09.03]Bring it in.
[10:10.65]Wait.
[10:10.79]You're not sending everybody, are you?
[10:11.75]Defend.
[10:14.49]Defend.
[10:14.73]Defend.
[10:15.21]Fight.
[10:15.89]Fight each other.
[10:19.34]What are you doing?
[10:20.70]It's not musical chairs.
[10:22.42]Fucking start swinging.
[10:23.32]What are you doing?
[10:23.84]We're good.
[10:36.54]Curious.
[10:42.43]Dude, this is not going well.
[10:47.63]What are they doing?
[10:49.81]Why are they like... Are we winning?
[10:58.70]I don't think we're winning.
[11:00.30]Oh yeah.
[11:01.14]Build up them troop numbers.
[11:04.14]Okay, why did we just get stomped?
[11:06.56]It was like 30 of us.
[11:14.37]Murius.
[11:16.03]What are you doing over here?
[11:19.45]Murius, you're just stepping on our own- Alright.
[11:21.55]Mur- I don't know what the fuck you've done, Murius, but, um, we're taking this town instead.
[11:27.08]Murius went the other way.
[11:29.58]Why did you go the other way?
[11:31.70]You got fuckin' distracted.
[11:34.16]No, not time to take a piss in the woods.
[11:35.74]Let's go.
[11:36.26]Over here.
[11:36.92]Support your friends.
[11:39.64]The gate is closed?
[11:40.62]He doesn't know how to open the gate?
[11:45.85]He doesn't know how to open the gate.
[11:47.37]Oh, fuck.
[11:48.25]Okay, whatever.
[11:57.61]Just hang out over here.
[12:02.00]What are you up to?
[12:02.50]Come here.
[12:05.52]Let's cap this.
[12:08.98]Okay.
[12:10.30]God damn it.
[12:14.20]Hey, never trust Nanners.
[12:15.42]Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[12:17.22]Thank you.
[12:17.60]Never trust Nanners.
[12:20.65]That's an old YouTube.
[12:22.65]Alright, he's kicking.
[12:23.25]That's good.
[12:23.85]Old YouTube.
[12:25.89]Old YouTube series, huh?
[12:27.87]That's an old one.
[12:28.45]Alright, we should get this one without a problem.
[12:31.31]Murius is up here now.
[12:35.04]The mine workers have to walk so far.
[12:38.31]Wait.
[12:39.83]Why are they going all the way over here?
[12:46.29]Why are they doing this?
[12:52.78]Or... There's no ore in here.
[12:54.28]Oh, shit.
[13:03.79]Alright, I got some tribute.
[13:05.05]Let me see if I can buy anything.
[13:06.89]Multi-hand pickup.
[13:09.49]Extend your grabbing ability and pick up many tribespeople at once.
[13:13.05]Yeah, I like this.
[13:15.47]Click and hold the action button when picking up an object to engage multi-pick.
[13:22.79]Alright, that's good.
[13:23.41]I like that.
[13:23.93]I want that.
[13:29.99]Multi-pickup is nice.
[13:31.07]Yeah, it seems like it's pretty nice.
[13:32.03]So there's no more ore in here.
[13:35.32]We'll have this city.
[13:36.06]Where's the nearest ore?
[13:37.34]Up here?
[13:37.78]Shit.
[13:40.72]How am I gonna do this?
[13:42.94]Am I gonna have to make, like, a storeroom over here, or just people are gonna have to walk?
[13:54.36]Oh, dear.
[13:54.78]Okay, he's coming back this way.
[13:56.42]He's not coming all the way down.
[13:57.28]I got archers.
[13:59.69]I should be okay.
[14:03.60]Are you going to get a lizard?
[14:05.50]Probably not.
[14:09.18]Alright, let's keep working.
[14:12.02]How are we doing on breeding?
[14:12.84]What does the population look like?
[14:16.48]Looking for food, but people are unhappy.
[14:19.43]We got 500.
[14:19.77]There's still 300 male to female.
[14:24.89]Ratio.
[14:26.93]300 male to... Wait, why is this still double the amount of men?
[14:34.77]I don't understand.
[14:35.39]Alright, let's get some more groups here.
[14:45.71]Let's do... Let's do like 50.
[14:53.23]No, let's do like 70.
[14:57.05]What's wrong with the cow?
[14:59.88]He's just kicking stuff.
[15:00.82]He's just...
[15:03.26]Look, I came over and he loves me.
[15:04.72]He's so happy to see me.
[15:05.82]Turn your blinker off.
[15:20.63]Ah, shit.
[15:21.23]How long has the blinker been on?
[15:22.41]I've been on the highway for two hours.
[15:27.09]Oh, I feel like a fucking real asshole.
[15:35.26]Alright, let's get some.
[15:37.70]This is still mine.
[15:38.53]It's time to build in here.
[15:40.59]They didn't have any... That's all, folks.
[15:51.25]Now, how do I drop it?
[15:54.75]Okay.
[15:56.03]I'll do it.
[15:56.59]I'm just going to clear this all out.
[15:57.91]Let's get a bunch of wood.
[15:58.67]Because I want to build some shit over here.
[16:11.11]So we get some plenty of wood.
[16:12.25]Alright, I got a store.
[16:13.41]I want a field up here for food.
[16:14.91]What the hell is that?
[16:19.89]Because they don't have... I mean, they have one field over here.
[16:26.15]They have a granary, though.
[16:29.04]You missed wink?
[16:34.28]No, I didn't.
[16:34.72]Take over three towns by force.
[16:40.48]I must have it.
[16:43.44]There's no fucking people that live here.
[16:46.40]Let's get some small houses.
[16:47.68]Let's get a couple of villas.
[16:49.64]That's a nursery.
[16:50.32]Villa.
[16:54.69]Why do they... Why do they always... They're already pissed off about this.
[16:56.89]Oh, there we go.
[16:58.49]Okay.
[16:58.67]That's... Okay, you're... They're unhappy in certain places.
[17:02.87]Okay.
[17:12.93]Happy next to the storeroom?
[17:21.86]Actual link?
[17:22.48]Well, use the one I just did.
[17:23.60]Fucking that stupid thing, man.
[17:29.10]That shit's gotta go.
[17:32.02]It's not even hard to do, but you know what I mean?
[17:33.96]It's just gotta go.
[17:35.02]It's not even hard to do it.
[17:43.32]I just did it!
[17:51.79]Another third- oh my god Blink again, slave They show their true qualities now
[18:07.57]Oh, they captured that town?
[18:09.77]Well, it's mine now.
[18:10.73]Stupid.
[18:10.99]I'm soaking.
[18:11.29]Yes, you are.
[18:12.05]Alright, now... I gotta build a war room.
[18:13.75]We're gonna put these guys away.
[18:15.19]We're gonna make them live here.
[18:16.19]We need an archer factory.
[18:38.64]I want these people to just start populating here.
[18:41.24]Is that another one?
[18:43.26]Because can they live in these houses?
[18:50.36]I'm sure they can.
[18:50.96]Alright, Murius, you can go back to doing what you were doing.
[18:57.31]Use some free will.
[18:59.75]Go do whatever you want.
[19:03.65]Another one.
[19:05.89]No, that was... Is it really?
[19:10.02]Okay, you're not aligned.
[19:10.76]Alright, whatever.
[19:13.10]I need to build a... Archer factory.
[19:32.35]Put this over here?
[19:33.95]No, put this down here.
[19:37.36]Alright, here we go.
[19:39.30]Right there.
[19:41.36]Get some of this wood.
[19:45.04]Bump it on here.
[19:53.01]Every time a screamer winks, an angel gets its wings.
[19:56.17]Huh?
[19:56.47]Oh.
[19:56.95]It's them.
[20:11.34]We need more food.
[20:13.60]Pronto.
[20:14.60]I like that word.
[20:15.48]Pronto.
[20:18.38]We need ore.
[20:19.36]Ore is gonna be... Alright, I need you to get ore.
[20:21.58]Here it is.
[20:22.12]Come here.
[20:23.90]It's time for you to gather ore.
[20:30.15]Yep.
[20:31.15]You can do it.
[20:31.81]You're very smart.
[20:37.83]Fake wings?
[20:38.51]I know.
[20:39.13]I can see them.
[20:41.12]I can see the wings.
[20:42.44]I know that which ones are real and which ones are fake.
[20:45.36]Alright, let's turn these guys back into... Let's make them just citizens.
[20:57.58]We're gonna have them live here.
[20:58.68]They're gonna start to collect shit here.
[21:00.64]I'm gonna bring the other army, who are this way.
[21:09.29]Right here.
[21:11.03]You guys right here.

[22:31.60]That's why it's going away.
[22:34.07]Citizen of the Jerma community.
[22:35.75]Yes.
[22:36.49]The winking will not exist anymore as of next week.
[22:39.69]So... Don't worry.
[22:42.43]It won't be here anymore.
[22:49.76]Why, Pepehands?
[22:51.26]Why?
[22:53.58]What do you mean nobody said that?
[22:54.70]It was very clear.
[22:55.52]Someone was like, this is dumb.
[22:56.80]And then I'm like, yeah.
[22:57.74]And then they said, yeah.
[22:58.46]And then they agreed.

[23:54.89]Has she?
[23:55.89]Not really.
[23:58.21]What?
[23:58.39]What are you talking about?
[24:02.10]Alright.
[24:02.62]This town is going to start rocking here.
[24:07.24]Let me get a field.
[24:08.30]And go.
[24:25.21]Let's water that field.
[24:38.48]How we doing on a whore?
[24:42.32]You can multi-pick people, too.
[24:43.72]Ah, shit, that's right.

[25:03.34]You're getting... You need to get the mine.
[25:05.96]Where did he even get the tree?
[25:11.64]Where is he getting the trees?
[25:16.26]No, there's wood on the ground over there.
[25:20.98]No, Nuss, don't pick up the fucking... One pebble!
[25:25.04]You could go into the mine and pick up a huge one.
[25:28.14]This is like worth 10 cents, Murius.
[25:33.51]That's not worth very much.
[25:34.85]1305.
[25:34.87]Okay, it was 95 ore.
[25:36.75]Good work.
[25:37.31]But pick up the big ones.
[25:47.93]This is when a little kid actually helps you clean the house.
[25:53.23]You've got, like, four bags of laundry on your back.
[25:55.98]You've got a mop in your hand.
[25:57.02]You mop on the floor.
[25:58.02]And they come over and they're like, I found this on the ground!
[26:00.68]It's like, oh, yeah, that's... What is that?
[26:03.26]Oh, that's a hair tie.
[26:05.20]Yeah, good.
[26:05.86]Okay, good work.

[26:17.05]Yeah, thanks for the coin.
[26:18.71]Okay.
[26:20.07]Yeah, good cleaning.
[26:21.33]We're cleaning.
[26:22.03]We're cleaning.
[26:22.77]We make up a song about cleaning.
[26:24.15]And then they go like, yay!
[26:25.67]And they get fucking happy.
[26:37.59]Decycling farmer.
[26:44.03]Stop doing the mom roleplay.
[26:49.94]He's not doing very much.
[26:51.16]He needs to learn more.
[26:53.28]What do I have?
[26:55.22]I need to... I still don't understand that.
[27:01.03]Let's get some more food.
[27:15.07]Alright, this town is going to start to become good.
[27:17.39]What is this?
[27:17.79]Is this a temple?
[27:18.64]Alright, it's a temple.
[27:23.36]Did he just put sand in there?
[27:24.52]Alright, I need... I need tribute.
[27:31.07]Gathering.
[27:31.67]I will always gather ore.
[27:33.31]Good.
[27:34.55]So now, let me... What's the next town?
[27:37.67]The next goal is to start to encroach.
[27:40.94]So I'm actually not going to do any violence here.
[27:44.02]I'm going to build up and get to right about here.
[27:48.83]Or is it always violence?
[27:49.93]What do you think?
[28:01.01]It's over here.
[28:06.89]Always violence?
[28:07.57]No, not always.
[28:11.40]What is this, a maze?
[28:21.46]Look, boys, that spy needs to get through the forest.
[28:25.32]He's going to get himself ambushed.
[28:27.78]If you spend the signs, you might be able to get him through safely.
[28:31.78]Those dumb ambushes will also follow the signs so we can send them on a wild goose chase and make sure the spy gets through.
[28:40.59]What?
[28:42.19]Oh, no.
[28:42.95]Okay.
[28:44.31]Make sure the spy gets through.
[28:48.45]Wait, do I just have to... Hold on.
[28:51.26]Save it!
[29:15.78]They seek me here.
[29:17.22]They seek me there.
[29:19.00]You have to turn the signs.
[29:22.21]Okay, save it again.
[29:23.03]Where does he need to go?
[29:32.59]Oh, God.
[29:34.25]Wait, which way does he need to go?
[29:48.68]I don't know which way he's actually supposed to end up.
[30:03.01]Here?
[30:11.84]Up here.
[30:12.10]Where does he need to go?
[30:15.42]Right here?
[30:19.31]Over here?
[30:19.63]Oh, right there.
[30:26.82]Don't turn this way.
[30:28.36]I win.
[30:31.02]Wait!

[30:36.07]Oh my god.
[30:37.73]I'm trying to move the fuck over here, but I can't move.
[30:42.05]I'm trying to get this... This is fucking RTS bullshit.
[30:49.23]I didn't get it.
[30:53.41]I got it.
[30:54.13]This is gonna be an actual living hell because when you get down here and you try to move around, it's like... I just tried to move like five times.
[31:19.00]You saw it happen.
[31:19.86]In real time.
[31:21.22]I was trying to move the camera.
[31:23.02]And I was stuck on a rock behind me.
[31:35.05]Here we go.
[31:50.47]I'll get it.
[31:50.79]Remember, your odor is foul.
[31:59.17]Whatever.
[31:59.51]What do you want me to tell you?
[32:04.44]He's using... He's using natural sea salt underneath my arms.
[32:08.16]What are you talking about?
[32:13.14]Is anyone coming?
[32:18.55]Where's the next one?
[32:19.99]Or is it the left?
[32:20.61]Alright, so this is okay.
[32:26.65]We gotta go... We just gotta follow that, wherever this guy was.
[32:29.70]We gotta go left, then... This guy's coming up.
[32:37.90]Turn this around.
[32:38.42]Which way is he gonna go?
[32:44.91]Is he gonna go straight up, or is he gonna take a right?
[32:49.67]Alright, we're good.
[32:50.19]Alright.

[43:13.25]Nobody wanted to go with me.
[43:14.01]I went by myself.
[43:16.50]And I just was sitting there going like this the whole time.

[49:00.81]What else did I unlock?
[49:01.79]Something else too, right?
[49:04.45]University.
[49:04.97]There it is.
[49:05.81]Alright, let's bring this over here.
[49:06.99]Because this is where the most people are.
[49:10.91]University can go... I mean, that's a pretty good spot for it.
[49:15.47]Or right over here?
[49:16.63]No, right here.
[49:19.43]University.
[49:22.96]Please tell me what Sonic is.
[49:27.32]I don't know.
[49:27.78]It's a movie that they remade...
[49:32.34]Almost the whole movie because Sonic looked like a real hedgehog, not like the actual Sonic the Hedgehog.
[49:40.62]They made him look like a person hedgehog thing with like human teeth and shit.
[49:44.10]Weird.
[49:44.68]Alright, here we go.
[49:46.85]So people are going to use this?
[49:57.49]Get the creature to help build 30 houses.
[50:00.52]Build a wonder.
[50:01.52]I still... How do I, like, research a wonder?
[50:08.69]Mansion.
[50:09.55]Skyscraper.
[50:10.35]Is that a wonder?
[50:12.75]Baths?
[50:15.63]Best siege engine.
[50:16.87]Meteor.
[50:17.75]Amphitheater.
[50:18.87]Best 100 soldiers.
[50:21.05]Best 100 archers.
[50:22.44]Here we go.
[50:22.90]Wonders.
[50:24.06]This is fucking 600,000 tribute.
[50:27.46]I'm not gonna have that.
[50:28.12]How am I gonna get that?
[50:33.24]Is this a funny movie compared to others that may have come out in the last six and a half weeks?
[50:37.78]Um... Yeah, I mean, of the year so far, I would think so.
[50:45.36]Probably.
[50:46.50]From what I've heard.
[50:48.92]Um... On all the stupid amount of AdSense space that they've paid for to make sure to tell me that every day.
[50:57.53]More than once a day.
[50:58.21]Uh...
[51:05.71]Okay.
[51:06.75]Good job.
[51:07.23]Did you do it?
[51:08.67]You did it.
[51:09.49]Okay.
[51:09.79]Now build.
[51:10.57]We need a... We need some houses up here.
[51:13.85]I want a well, too.
[51:14.65]Build this, too.
[51:15.32]Build everything.
[51:15.80]I'm getting tired.
[51:16.32]Build that.
[51:16.68]You can do it.
[51:23.32]Get a manor in here.
[51:33.23]Oh, I gotta get him off this leash.
[51:35.95]Continue to build, though.
[51:36.79]Not enough space for a manor.
[51:55.41]One more house.
[51:55.83]Come on.
[51:57.83]I'm gonna put a well right here.
[52:00.33]The university's gonna go over here, too.
[52:06.51]Right there.
[52:07.63]Alright.
[52:08.47]Now we can build it.
[52:12.53]Repeat the joke.
[52:18.54]More wood.
[52:20.82]Replace wink with wasting points.
[52:24.92]What, it just says you throw away 75,000 points?
[52:44.18]People are using them because they know they're going away.
[52:45.97]It's an interesting experiment, if you will.
[52:50.83]Because people know it's going away.
[52:54.31]So they're like, oh fuck, I gotta use it now before they become worthless.
[53:06.30]I'm saving for whatever's next.
[53:07.74]It's smart.
[53:09.16]I'm saving for the future.
[53:23.23]Yeah, you do.
[53:23.71]What am I supposed to do about this?
[53:28.56]What happens if you run out of wood?
[53:30.66]Game over.
[53:31.12]That's game over if you run out of wood.
[53:36.20]I'm getting concerned about this.
[53:43.27]I'm getting concerned here.
[53:57.40]Wait, Munga S question mark?
[53:58.81]Is this the time for me to do this?
[54:00.11]Did I say Munga S?
[54:03.17]I mean, as I think so.
[54:04.01]This is kind of scary.
[54:11.93]We need wood.
[54:14.89]Gentle.
[54:18.79]What did you do?
[54:20.67]Don't throw.
[54:22.76]I'm going to rip out and gather that tree.
[54:24.82]Good.
[54:26.51]Very useful, Mirias.
[54:27.74]Thank you.
[54:30.24]Is this a monkey?
[54:30.88]I don't know if it is.
[54:35.76]I had a story to tell you guys.
[54:37.00]I don't remember what it was.
[54:41.06]It was weird.
[54:41.78]I'm trying to remember what the hell it was.
[54:48.51]What was the story?
[54:53.09]Oh, nothing to do with Sonic.
[54:54.07]What the hell was it?
[55:01.90]I don't remember.
[55:04.75]Maybe it'll come to me eventually, one day.
[55:11.29]French fries?
[55:12.51]No, no.
[55:13.31]Nothing to do with French fries.
[55:14.31]Alright, now we have some actual settlements here.
[55:20.48]It's time to... Well, go get it!
[55:26.89]Why are you looking at me?
[55:40.54]I sometimes decide to get wood.
[55:42.68]Yes, very good.
[55:46.58]We'll go get it.
[55:47.66]I want wood.
[55:48.38]We'll go get it.
[55:49.90]It's right next to your town.
[55:51.36]I'm getting it.
[55:52.84]Look at me.
[55:57.35]Do we have a lumber mill?
[56:00.27]If I don't, I will soon.
[56:06.90]No lumber mill here?
[56:07.60]What the fuck am I even doing with my fucking life right now?
[56:11.82]No lumber mill.

[56:37.78]It's a very cool game.
[56:38.70]It is.
[56:40.42]It is a very cool game.
[56:41.38]I agree.
[56:43.44]That's why we're doing it two streams in a row.

[87:32.54]With your electricity hands.
[87:42.32]Yes, get some rest.
[87:53.46]Get the creature to help build 30 houses.
[87:54.94]I didn't do that yet, but whatever.
[87:55.98]Okay, what do they have?
[88:00.04]I'm going to build some more houses up here.
[88:02.58]And we're going to slowly move up this whole line.
[88:05.70]Are you ready?
[88:06.04]House.
[88:20.95]Let's go.
[88:23.48]Time to start influence.
[88:24.52]They don't want to be near the granary, but I need you to do this so I can get more influence.
[88:36.81]Let's get it on, gentlemen.
[88:38.63]What is that?
[88:39.09]Oh, that's... The United Fighting Circuit.
[88:57.68]Burma has watched Inuyasha.
[89:02.30]Yeah, um, I have.
[89:05.16]That before anybody freaks out, it's because it was on every single day.
[89:09.54]Every single fucking day on Adult Swim.
[89:12.64]At like 2 o'clock in the morning, they'd play like 7 episodes back to back.
[89:16.52]If you had Adult Swim on, it would be on.
[89:20.59]Yeah, that's true.
[89:21.19]Of course, yeah.
[89:23.51]What, am I gonna deny that?
[89:24.25]That's real.
[89:34.68]Influence.
[89:36.34]Influence.
[89:38.50]Influence!
[89:51.95]More influence.
[89:55.01]I want your people... ...to see these houses going up and go, fuck, that actually looks like a pretty good place to live!
[90:03.80]Right through a mountain pass.
[90:06.82]Wow, that looks awesome.
[90:09.46]How much does that cost?
[90:10.54]What are those going for?
[90:14.36]Free.
[90:15.98]Free?
[90:17.35]Free.
[90:21.61]I think I'm gonna join Jermaland.
[90:26.79]All you have to do is spend time in the mines.
[90:37.34]And have a ton of sex.
[90:43.32]You just have to... You just have to have a bunch of sex.
[90:48.82]That's all I ask.
[90:59.18]I really am just like building up into their face.
[91:03.71]This is so stupid.
[91:05.29]Alright, this is dumb.
[91:07.77]I gotta put another building over here.
[91:09.07]This is really bad.
[91:13.80]Once we get up here, I'm gonna build, like, a temple or something.
[91:21.38]What's going on?
[91:24.06]Why do I... Somehow I'm doing gestures and I don't even mean to be.
[91:28.25]Okay.
[91:39.59]I think it's pretty cool, to be honest.
[91:40.91]I mean, yeah, it is kind of cool.
[91:48.70]Alright, now it's time to stop building houses.
[91:51.96]And put, like, a tavern right here.
[91:56.30]Let's go.
[92:00.43]We're gonna put a tavern back here.
[92:03.25]So these people can... Yeah, look at that!
[92:04.33]Look at how much happy everybody is!
[92:09.09]We'll have a road connect to this.
[92:10.15]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[92:27.80]You have it.
[92:30.14]I need a road.
[92:31.48]We're just going to go from here.
[92:38.08]Come on.
[92:39.78]Alright, from here.
[92:44.86]What's wrong?
[92:48.30]Here we go.
[92:49.26]Tavern.
[92:49.88]The local tavern.
[92:51.06]Everyone's happy.
[92:53.46]I'm going to get that wood.
[92:54.38]I'm going to sneeze in about 20-30 minutes.
[92:56.32]Or maybe even 30 seconds.
[92:57.70]I'm not sure.
[92:58.88]You know how that works?
[93:00.48]I couldn't tell.
[93:12.42]Mine worker.
[93:13.96]They're walking into their territory to use their mine.
[93:18.58]Is that what's actually happening?
[93:19.68]Any more rocks I can throw?
[93:20.62]Alright, let's keep going.
[93:24.07]I want to put a well right here so they can have some good drinking water.
[93:29.55]And you know what?
[93:30.39]You build it.
[93:32.17]Let's also put a statue market right here.
[93:41.82]Very cool.
[93:43.26]And you build it.
[93:50.57]And then we're going to build a temple.
[93:57.19]No, I can't do that yet.
[93:59.13]What's small enough where I can... Let's put a nursery over here.
[94:01.61]There's going to be lots of children.
[94:04.02]Lots of kids.
[94:06.40]Okay.
[94:06.52]Okay.
[94:08.37]Then let's do... I keep seeing stock market for that.
[94:12.03]University?
[94:12.53]I don't have a university here yet.
[94:17.15]I don't know.
[94:23.46]Maybe I don't.
[94:35.10]Sims University?
[94:39.84]Alright, does this have to be within a certain range to do anything?
[94:42.24]Or what?
[94:49.50]University right next to the tavern.
[94:51.06]Perfect.
[94:57.23]What else?
[94:57.51]What am I missing here?
[95:06.38]Alright, we got lots of food.
[95:07.48]I need a... Do I have a lumber mill in this town?
[95:09.74]I do.
[95:10.62]That's a granary.
[95:14.54]Lumber mill?
[95:15.00]I need a lumber mill up here.
[95:20.41]I don't have a lumber mill up here, right?
[95:27.67]What am I going to do when I reach 10 million views on my Twitch channel?
[95:30.59]How close are we?
[95:33.59]How much further do we have?
[95:42.13]I need to put some more.
[95:43.23]Let's do a manor.
[95:48.67]We got to keep this going.
[95:50.25]Manor.
[95:52.88]Manor.
[95:56.12]I will take care of this.
[95:57.08]9,956,000 views right now.
[96:02.04]I'm almost at 10 million views on Twitch.
[96:13.66]That's pretty cool.
[96:25.99]I need to water those trees over there.
[96:31.73]Is this done?
[96:32.79]No.
[96:35.43]Look, I gotta come in and fucking fix it.
[96:39.17]Actual wink?
[96:40.14]Okay.
[96:45.51]Now I need ore.

[96:58.81]Now I can take over this little spot.
[97:00.59]Good.
[97:01.39]We'll put a... Something over here.
[97:04.99]What should I put over here?
[97:05.75]Let's keep the ore and shit over this way.
[97:07.13]Alright, what do I put over here?
[97:09.29]A, um... A temple?
[97:10.97]There were two wings?
[97:21.54]Temple's going right here.
[97:26.90]Yeah.
[97:27.62]Right here.
[97:30.98]Just so they can see it.
[97:32.06]As far over as I can put it.
[97:34.40]Like, right there.
[97:35.06]Look at this.
[97:35.38]It's gonna be... Whoa!
[97:38.56]Murius, I need you up here because... There's a potential... There's potential for some violence as I... Tell, um... Uh, people to come and, uh... Defect over to me.
[97:49.01]When I tell these people to defect...
[97:52.87]Over here.
[97:54.21]In fact, to me.
[97:57.19]I need you over here to hang out.
[97:59.05]In fact, you can help me build this.
[98:13.00]Well, then go poo.
[98:14.17]That's the first time I've ever seen you sit down to go poo.
[98:18.75]Is everything alright?
[98:28.77]You alright?
[98:36.37]Why do I always get the camera ready for it?
[98:49.60]I'm gonna squeeze out a big log on that building.
[98:54.18]Do they have to make it so disgusting?
[98:58.84]How do you play with a building?

[100:04.47]People happy, funny.
[100:07.31]Alright, finish building this.
[100:27.93]It's time to laugh later.
[100:28.93]I need wood.
[100:38.57]We're running out of wood.
[100:40.13]When I take this place over, just you wait, we're gonna get extra wood.
[100:47.73]Uh oh, here we go.
[100:48.33]Hi.
[100:51.87]My, uh, my border is hitting your border.
[100:54.80]My influence is hitting your influence.
[100:56.38]I wonder what would happen if I were to put, um, let's say, a really cool, uh, hey.
[101:06.13]Hey, guys.
[101:34.07]Imagine looking out your window and seeing, wow, those, the Greeks are really pushing forward and they have a ton of influence and they're right at our gate here.
[101:43.42]And they built a temple in a bunch of cool towns and suburbs.
[101:46.40]What are they building?
[101:46.86]What's the first thing they're going to build in front of us, way far away from everything else?
[101:50.40]Ooh.
[101:54.88]Oi.
[101:55.96]That's... He's been depositing trees again.
[102:03.57]Look what I found in your room, Murius.
[102:05.83]More trees.
[102:08.13]I don't want to find this shit anymore.
[102:10.55]I know, Mom, don't go through my stuff, but what the fuck is this, Murius?
[102:17.10]No more.
[102:24.70]Was Anthony over here today?
[102:26.23]Is that what it is?
[102:28.39]You know, I don't like him.
[102:35.71]I need ore.
[102:41.88]He's a bad influence on you.
[102:55.39]Torture pit.
[102:56.45]Alright, we're in.
[102:57.97]So... I can...
[103:07.54]Let's test it.
[103:12.45]Wait, I need a... I need wood.
[103:51.11]What happens if you cross the streams here?
[104:05.66]Uh, I've crossed the streams.
[104:20.74]I'm going to put a graveyard over here because it's needed.
[104:22.32]This is the graveyard.
[104:23.72]I'm going to use that villager as a free weight.
[104:29.08]Okay.
[104:34.17]Are you my townsperson?
[104:36.23]Where's anybody in this town?
[104:37.89]These people are fucked up over here.
[104:39.29]Alright, let's build some... Let's get some more influence.
[104:42.53]I need... Oh, he's already going for it.
[104:43.83]Okay, let's do... What has some influence?
[104:45.85]It's not a temple.
[104:48.17]Probably...
[104:50.68]This is what I think about you.
[104:53.14]Yeah.
[104:54.64]Fuck you.
[104:55.14]I'm going to put a wall up right here.
[105:00.32]They already all left for you.
[105:01.72]Oh.
[105:10.15]I need water.
[105:12.09]Let's water this tree or something.
[105:13.23]Whatever.
[105:18.63]Just vibing.
[105:21.53]I know the meaning of that word now.
[105:22.57]Alright.
[105:25.84]Oh, okay.
[105:27.84]I want to do this.
[105:29.36]So we're going to do a storehouse up here because everything's really far away.
[105:38.54]I'm just trying to dump into there.
[105:40.18]Let's just take it.
[105:43.01]Just take it.
[105:47.77]I need a shitload of wood.
[105:49.01]Who has the most wood?
[105:49.93]Somebody does.
[105:50.97]One of these towns has a ton.
[105:53.61]I think it's this one.
[105:54.69]Yeah, you guys have so much wood.
[105:55.75]Look at this.
[105:56.57]This is ridiculous.
[106:03.12]Okay, I don't want to take it all.
[106:09.14]That's good.
[106:18.88]Who died?
[106:19.24]Okay, we're... This is mine, though.
[106:32.61]I own this.
[106:36.01]Hey, we both own this.
[106:37.37]That's not fair.
[106:46.73]What's up with this?
[106:47.73]We both own this.
[106:56.09]I'm curious.
[106:56.49]Pick that up.
[107:26.15]Where's he going?
[107:27.79]No, no, no, Murius.
[107:28.61]Do not go that way.
[107:30.91]Murius, pick up more rocks.
[107:39.35]Murius, pick up... Murius, step on... Yeah, just... Who cares?
[107:46.46]Make it quick.
[107:56.29]Through the legs.
[107:57.09]Did you see that?
[107:58.39]That was an advanced technique.
[108:03.95]Advanced.
[108:05.88]Pick up that rock, Murius.
[108:08.46]Get that rock.
[108:10.90]Alright, throw the rock at the building.
[108:17.64]Yes!
[108:18.44]Good job.
[108:30.92]I'm making him into a killing machine.
[108:33.94]Alright, now let's take this over.
[108:37.02]Just hang out over here.
[108:37.78]We're going to get some soldiers to take this over.
[108:39.70]And then I have... I mean, then it's over.
[108:43.44]I win.
[108:44.72]This shit's over.
[108:49.89]Are you ready?
[108:51.35]Are we ready for this?
[108:54.33]Because I'm going to have like a thousand troops.
[108:57.41]Are we ready?
[109:01.49]I'm gonna make siege weapons, and I'm gonna have like 1,200 soldiers.
[109:05.94]You can take people over with love and kindness.
[109:07.80]I just tried.
[109:08.46]I crossed the streams.
[109:10.64]I made it the DNA strand.
[109:12.06]It didn't do anything.
[109:12.88]Nobody cares.
[109:14.26]I tried to influence him with, uh... Well... Doesn't matter.
[109:23.45]He's just kicking this shit.
[109:25.67]Alright, let's take this, capture this over.
[109:27.59]Okay, please.
[109:30.89]I need some soldiers.
[109:34.76]Just enough to take it over.
[109:37.82]Let's just get, like, 20.
[109:43.64]Use the torture pit?
[109:44.26]There's nobody even over here.
[109:45.01]They've all defected.
[109:46.15]Alright, stop kicking this.
[109:48.69]Stop it, stop it.
[109:49.31]Free will.
[109:50.19]Do whatever you want, but... That works, too.
[110:13.89]Good use of free will, to be honest, yeah.
[110:17.23]Not bad.
[110:17.67]I just need one person to go take this over.
[110:25.66]He still doesn't know how to play?
[110:28.84]No, we've had people defect.
[110:30.68]We've had the flag that you can drag over, but there's nobody here.
[110:38.55]They all left.
[110:39.11]I think they already all left anyways.
[110:45.34]Look at him.
[110:45.84]He's still snuggling on the tree.
[110:47.76]He loves trees.
[110:48.44]Alright, here we go.
[110:54.13]We have a full platoon.
[110:55.55]11, 12.
[110:56.23]That's all.
[110:58.71]I don't want any more.
[110:59.51]Why is so many people coming over here?
[111:01.11]What did I do?
[111:02.03]10 people?
[111:10.92]Why is this still happening?
[111:13.38]Men.
[111:13.74]Oh, 20.
[111:13.86]Okay.
[111:23.81]Kill every living thing.
[111:25.45]20,000.
[111:25.47]Um, I don't think I want to do that.
[111:30.92]Alright, he's up.
[111:36.22]Let's take it and be ready because he might send... Alright, while they take this, I need to make siege engines.
[111:45.97]Put it in here.
[111:46.51]Okay, siege engines.
[111:47.79]Free will, you're on.
[111:48.47]I got 41,000.
[111:50.14]We'll save it.
[111:52.38]Siege engines.
[111:53.34]Actually, I have to upgrade it, don't I?
[111:59.20]Book called the... What is this?
[112:01.62]An ancient tome forgotten lore.
[112:02.98]Oh, it's just a lore book.
[112:07.92]Okay, siege weapons.
[112:08.80]50,000.
[112:09.52]I don't have enough.
[112:11.46]I can't do siege weapons.
[112:14.73]I already have a massive siege engine, yeah?
[112:21.01]Um... That's fucking... Let's go.
[112:26.66]Save it.
[112:27.14]Let's go.
[112:27.52]I'm taking him over.
[112:28.92]He's dead.
[112:34.24]Let's make, um, like 5,000 troops.
[112:37.10]I got it saved right before this, too.
[112:38.26]We're going all in.
[112:56.65]You want to see where the real army is going to come from?
[112:57.99]There's a thousand people in this place.
[113:03.97]You ready for the real army?
[113:19.15]So it's war then.

[114:05.28]The ad that you've probably seen more than a hundred times.
[114:09.32]Is too much advertising taking over our entire lives?
[114:26.39]Look at this.
[114:27.57]Perfect.
[114:29.85]Ooh, nice throw, Bjorgis.

[114:46.31]Fucking like 10,000 people.
[114:48.75]Oh, even more.
[114:49.49]Keep it going.
[114:50.41]Open the gate.
[114:56.68]We have 131.
[114:58.88]It's still coming.
[115:01.22]We're eating all the food, but it doesn't matter.
[115:02.72]We're about to conquer.
[115:07.63]Do we even need these?
[115:08.57]Yeah, we do.
[115:09.09]Look at this.
[115:09.89]Alright.
[115:10.47]Are you ready?
[115:14.63]I think we throw rocks first.
[115:18.70]We need a good supply of rocks.
[115:20.48]I know just where to find them.
[115:37.12]Really?
[115:37.38]I can't get these.
[115:47.74]Nope.
[116:00.25]Not enough on it.
[116:02.59]God damn it.
[116:04.59]Not enough on it.
[116:05.25]It's too heavy.
[116:13.21]What was that?

[116:42.56]Alright, bring the army.
[116:54.78]Okay, here we go.
[117:05.19]Pick it up.
[117:08.13]You got a long way to go.
[117:09.47]But it'll be worth it.
[117:16.21]And the archers.
[117:30.34]An army marches on.
[117:31.68]I have a creature den over here, right?

[118:07.50]Alright, Murius, you can do whatever you want.
[118:10.86]When a real battle begins at dawn.
[118:16.13]Battle begins at dawn.
[118:19.43]Look, a messenger!
[118:21.07]Send him!
[118:23.33]I thought he was gonna run that way.
[118:27.93]Look, a messenger!
[119:09.00]I want rocks.
[119:13.06]Mirrius, I need you to find rocks and bring them to me.
[119:20.31]Alright, Mirrius.
[119:21.23]We've got some rocks.
[119:22.19]I need you to pick up that rock.
[119:24.13]Armies are ready.
[119:29.55]Bring that rock over here.
[119:30.53]I want you to put that rock down right here.
[119:46.83]I'd like you to get the other rock.
[119:48.09]I want you to have a supply of rocks.
[119:51.11]Oh, the other one right here.
[119:53.51]Because I want Murius to throw them over the gate.
[120:00.88]Okay.
[120:01.54]We have so many troops.
[120:02.90]Let's do or die here.
[120:03.80]Let's do it.
[120:11.99]So, we engage this group on the field.
[120:15.69]We aggro with a Murius Rock Throw.
[120:23.59]Let's see if we can get an aggro here.
[120:35.28]They have archers?
[120:37.24]Doesn't look like it.
[120:41.40]Holy shit!
[120:47.25]I didn't think you could go that far.
[120:48.61]That was amazing.
[120:49.41]Alright.
[120:55.35]Get him away from the gate.
[121:01.08]Pick up something else.
[121:01.84]Pick up... Throw some more shit.
[121:02.86]Pick up a tree.
[121:05.60]You don't want to put yourself in harm's way.
[121:06.68]Not yet.
[121:10.08]He just let it go.
[121:25.85]Oh boy.
[121:26.37]Okay.
[121:32.29]Good kick.
[121:37.25]Bring him in.
[121:39.63]Use your hotkeys?
[121:44.82]What?
[121:45.08]Oh, fuck.
[121:46.16]That's what the numbers above them mean.
[121:51.40]My god.
[122:09.95]I thought that was their level.
[122:11.35]I thought that was their level.
[122:15.37]I thought it was like that's how strong they are.
[122:16.73]Like they're level 3s, level 4s.
[122:20.34]What?
[122:22.98]What's a siren call?
[122:34.21]What is that?
[122:34.75]Is that a bomb?
[122:36.17]Um...
[122:39.35]What?
[122:41.69]Who's the siren?
[122:55.38]Murius, turn around!
[122:57.20]Murius!
[122:58.26]Murius, turn around!
[123:00.34]Murius, come kill this thing!
[123:03.34]Murius, attack!
[123:08.08]Pick up the rock!
[123:10.18]Throw it at this lady!
[123:11.04]Throw it!
[123:17.06]No, he's just going in!
[123:25.93]What do I do?
[123:30.69]What's going on?
[123:56.77]Huh?
[124:02.27]Is everybody alright?
[124:06.53]What?
[124:06.92]Wait, what is going on?
[124:21.56]Why are they all...
[124:27.36]What?
[124:27.72]They're all just wandering?
[124:54.75]How often can you do that?
[124:58.78]They're def- they're defecating.
[125:00.53]They're def- they're defecating.
[125:03.11]Are they... Are they still my citizens?
[125:11.56]Get back in there and fight!
[125:42.13]Can't avoid it.
[125:42.73]Are you sure about that?
[125:44.65]Because I can send in like two people.
[125:50.99]And who cares?
[125:52.50]And then I can send everybody else in after it's wasted.
[125:59.22]Just go in after that.
[126:11.45]Okay.
[126:15.00]Take it over!
[126:16.02]We got it.
[126:17.86]Now I know what happens.
[126:21.62]Report the stream for save scumming?
[126:23.51]No, that's a +2.
[126:24.75]Smart.
[126:29.11]It's only ten minutes.
[126:39.55]I gotta pee.
[126:40.66]Rebecca, I gotta pee.
[129:03.63]Hello.
[129:03.93]How are you?
[129:09.50]So, the strategy here is to bait out the siren.
[129:12.38]Alright.
[129:15.54]Bait the siren out.
[129:19.10]Have the siren happen.
[129:21.07]Send in the real army.
[129:25.71]Murius does not pay attention to the siren.
[129:32.17]Get a wink.
[129:39.77]Okay.
[129:40.53]Capture it.
[129:41.45]Take it.
[129:43.09]And then I'm going to save the game again.
[129:47.37]But should I?
[129:48.47]I wonder if I should get this first.
[129:52.04]You know what I mean?
[129:54.62]Should I just take over the whole thing?
[129:57.84]Or just who cares?
[129:58.80]This town's not even worth it.
[129:59.76]Just go for the main one.
[130:15.04]Who cares, bro?
[130:21.07]Alright, guys.
[130:23.21]It's time to make a small group.
[130:28.31]Murius is going to have a little bit of target practice up here.
[130:34.04]Let's get here.
[130:34.94]We go this group will be the siren group if we get the door open and let's do um platoon size of five people five people Can you adopt chat and have us all move into your streamer mansion?
[131:00.67]That's you're describing a town
[131:05.36]You're describing just as big as a town is.
[131:12.30]I would just be the mayor.
[131:13.22]Alright, here's the bait crew.
[131:19.01]Bait crew here.
[131:21.05]This is actual attack crew.
[131:25.45]Streamer town?
[131:28.57]No.
[131:28.74]Are you on free will for the time being, Murius?
[131:30.46]Get on free will.
[131:32.00]Do whatever you want.
[131:32.82]Relax.
[131:33.76]Have some food.
[131:35.62]Let's get this game saved here, just in case this does not fucking work.
[131:42.36]It very well might not, so we don't have to wait again.
[131:44.10]Alright.
[131:47.18]Army is coming back.
[131:50.36]All able-bodied men.
[131:54.86]Let's get you in here.
[132:02.35]I want... Let's go with...
[132:08.76]How many do I want of these soldiers here?
[132:10.94]I want... I want a hundred.
[132:16.18]One hundred.
[132:18.78]No.
[132:19.16]Hundred and... Hundred and... Hundred and fucking fifty.
[132:23.57]No.
[132:23.89]One forty.
[132:26.33]One forty.
[132:32.39]And then I want the rest of the archers.
[132:35.71]Not gonna get siren this time.
[132:40.34]Is there any other towns that have a military capability?
[132:49.37]Because if you do... I'm going to be using you.
[132:52.49]Oh, look at this.
[132:53.07]Hi, guys.
[132:53.49]I need you as well.
[132:57.78]How many can you spare?
[132:59.86]Ten.
[133:01.02]Alright.
[133:02.28]We'll take them all.
[133:03.04]We'll take whoever you got.
[133:03.92]I hope you can get us.
[133:09.45]And then you.
[133:10.23]You've already got Max.
[133:11.61]Okay.
[133:15.95]I will subscribe to the Jermatown tier.
[133:20.35]Where's my fart?

[140:16.44]Good!
[140:21.05]He ran into the wall.
[140:22.81]It's not gonna work on Murius.
[140:25.53]Attack!
[140:28.73]You already got the wall down, Murius.
[140:30.21]You're good.
[140:31.95]Murius!

[141:54.93]That's bullshit!
[141:58.23]Mirragus wouldn't even need him.
[142:00.95]Get me the fuck in there.
[142:03.23]Siren or not.
[142:07.08]You must know that you're fucking doomed.
[142:15.82]Murius, kill something.
[142:21.50]Oh, this is bad.
[142:25.61]Punished for save scumming.
[142:30.05]Okay, Murius, retreat.
[142:31.53]Retreat, retreat, retreat.
[142:32.59]Everybody retreat.
[142:34.87]Retreat.
[142:37.19]Oh, this is so bad.
[142:40.95]I'm gonna tear down those walls.
[142:42.27]How many people in the military do you even have?
[142:45.72]a lot just cause a problem just break shit what do you did he just suck that into his ass what is he doing
[143:23.33]Too much he did.
[143:24.47]He was too much for him.
[143:26.61]He went too hard.
[143:31.13]Blown out ass.
[143:36.90]So what happens to all these people?
[143:38.58]Are all these people gonna come back over here?
[143:44.10]Sound the fucking military bells again.
[143:46.42]What the fuck?
[143:48.78]Let's go.
[143:53.45]Let's go!
[143:53.97]I need military.
[144:00.38]Where?
[144:02.44]They're not yours anymore.
[144:03.66]What?
[144:06.82]Where the fuck are they going?
[144:08.80]They're obviously going here.
[144:18.18]Wait.
[144:19.12]Hold on.
[144:19.56]So...
[144:22.92]They're not my citizens anymore.
[144:27.60]Okay.
[144:28.20]So, new plan.
[144:29.56]Save scum version 2.
[144:31.67]Disband all military.
[144:33.53]Send one... They're out of range.
[144:43.20]Weren't they all the way back?
[144:44.16]Wait, hold on.
[144:44.60]I'm going to try one more thing.
[144:47.44]Military option.
[145:05.03]We're going to disband.
[145:07.87]It works on citizens.
[145:08.61]Wait, it works on everyone.
[145:11.17]Oh, it doesn't matter.
[145:12.26]It works on literally everyone.
[145:17.12]It actually just ruins everything.
[145:21.44]I wonder if I can get in there.
[145:27.18]I wonder if I can throw fireballs over the fucking fence and blow up the building.
[145:37.81]Let's hang out here for a second.
[145:40.35]A true military master knows exactly when to attack.
[145:52.56]We're gonna burn the fucking city down.
[145:57.50]Move him out of range.
[145:58.84]Alright, we're going to move everybody down here.
[146:00.13]I'm going to teach Miri's fireball.
[146:11.55]Is that far enough away?
[146:12.57]I know.
[146:14.85]Plus one, two, three, four, one, two.
[146:16.33]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[146:20.61]This is not far enough away.
[146:24.67]Well, just get him out of the way.
[146:29.20]Uh, where is... Does Murius know Fireball?
[146:33.19]Murius knows Lightning.
[146:34.79]Do you know Fireball?
[146:41.31]Shield.
[146:42.09]Water.
[146:42.51]Heal.
[146:44.61]Lightning.
[146:45.01]You already know Lightning.
[146:45.99]Fire Miracle.
[146:46.76]90,000.
[146:47.80]Don't know nothing.
[147:04.29]Moving closer.
[147:04.81]Uh, it's time to encroach and then just rain hell.
[147:15.84]I will bait out the siren by throwing fireballs probably, right?
[147:18.62]Is that what's gonna happen?
[147:21.15]I think I might just have to live with it.
[147:22.17]Alright, somebody confirm that this military is still too close.
[147:28.37]Should I move them even further away?
[147:33.73]Or is that actually... Can I not... The siren has a limited range.
[147:40.27]You can save them.
[147:42.45]Do it just in case.
[147:43.23]Alright, we're going to move them all the way back here.
[147:59.03]Tuck him up Mega Milk's ass instead.
[148:00.71]That's not even his name.
[148:07.05]Okay.
[148:10.87]We need to encroach a little bit.
[148:17.92]Let's encroach with a... I'm going to put a... Should I just put another temple up here?
[148:23.60]Just to get even more?
[148:25.62]Just temple strategy?
[148:28.14]I got plenty of resources.
[148:29.88]I'm going to do temple strategy.
[148:32.73]That's tavern.
[148:33.71]That also starts with a T, Jeremy.
[148:35.13]Yes, you're learning.
[148:35.69]Okay.
[148:36.99]Very good.
[148:55.17]You gonna help?
[148:56.35]Muscle milk?
[148:58.29]Put it up.
[148:58.69]Muscle milk's mega ass.
[149:01.41]Alright, that was funny.
[149:03.60]I like that one.
[149:07.82]He did inhale a whole military tent up his ass.
[149:12.30]Let's just face the facts.
[149:28.46]I'm gonna bring all this up.
[149:32.80]Happy Friday.
[149:33.38]Happy Friday.
[149:33.98]I hope you guys are doing well.
[149:37.99]Hope you guys are doing good.
[149:38.79]I'm doing good.
[149:41.21]Just chilling here with fucking Murius the Muscle Milk.
[149:53.09]It's not Friday.
[149:53.77]It is Friday.
[149:59.58]alright we keep going now I'm gonna pick that up and while we have access now to I'm gonna build a couple of this dump alright we're gonna do uh I'm gonna make a couple of houses up here just enough to you know maybe get some more space
[150:31.26]So we have perfect access.
[150:32.62]I thought it was Saturday.
[150:35.08]No, it's Friday.
[150:39.52]I'm going to stop house cheesing.
[150:43.66]Hey, I'm given my godly powers to do what I want.
[150:46.92]I'm going to do the house cheese encroachment strategy. ...
[151:03.62]Okay.
[151:31.58]Good.
[151:31.82]This is a good spot.
[151:33.28]This is enough room for me to be throwing fireballs just all over the place.
[151:41.81]Maybe a... This seems like a bad idea.
[152:03.81]House encroachment, just so I know what it is.
[152:21.38]Damn it.
[152:23.86]Come on, I can't get this anywhere in here.
[152:40.95]When's the next naked Lord of the Rings marathon?
[152:42.85]I did them all!
[153:09.91]Don't even fucking know it's in store for you, motherfucker.
[153:13.75]Alright.
[153:16.96]I need to... Wait.
[153:18.08]Put these in a place where I know they are.
[153:19.22]Stack them up nice.
[153:28.68]Emples have a much larger influence radius.
[153:30.44]Yeah, but in case these get attacked... It's alright.
[153:34.65]They're inexpensive.
[153:36.13]Put this back in the storeroom.
[153:37.25]Murius is asleep.
[153:39.69]Alright.
[153:41.19]Let's just do a test here.
[153:43.33]Save this under encroachment strategy.
[153:49.86]Can you stream my taxes, Jeremiah?
[153:51.44]I don't know how to do them.
[153:52.58]That's why you hire a tax professional.
[153:56.58]You get a tax professional to help you figure out what you need to do.
[154:11.28]BURN IT DOWN!
[154:18.41]Oh, that was, uh, that was a lot.
[154:21.65]Welcome to hell.
[154:23.81]Where's the siren?
[154:25.29]See, I got dogshit strategy too.

[160:14.12]There's a lot of people here though.

[160:38.84]Okay, let's... Did he throw it?
[160:55.86]Did he just ass blast that over here?

[163:40.57]This is... Oh, I almost have it.
[163:44.69]More.
[163:46.63]Set the cow free.
[163:48.53]No, no, I don't want him to die.
[163:49.41]He's gonna go pray and get killed.
[163:51.36]Wait, you know what?
[163:54.06]Furious.
[163:55.80]The Greek creature faces us in battle.
[163:58.85]This is worrying.
[164:01.13]It is.
[164:01.71]Because you're all about to burn.
[164:02.85]Come on.
[164:07.79]Back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[164:13.82]Tactical retreat.
[164:14.98]Tactical retreat.
[164:16.04]Tactical retreat.
[164:19.34]Okay.
[164:20.04]Burn.
[164:21.96]Stay on that rock for a second.
[164:29.61]They didn't follow.
[164:40.41]He wants to go back there so bad.
[164:42.75]He's like, let me back over there, please.
[164:44.63]I don't want to throw it and hit him.
[164:49.27]Mirrors, just watch out.
[164:50.13]I'm going to throw it.
[164:50.85]I'm quite afraid.
[164:52.17]Move out of the way.
[164:54.58]Move out of the way.
[164:55.06]Go over this way.
[164:59.14]Get... Murius.
[165:00.88]Watch out.
[165:03.24]Murius.
[165:03.66]Murius.
[165:06.10]Wait.
[165:08.07]Come over here.
[165:09.69]Move.
[165:11.01]Move.
[165:13.07]Flaming boulder.
[165:34.19]This is so stupid.
[165:36.05]This is so fucked up.
[165:37.61]I- okay.
[165:41.30]Now, Mirrius, come back.
[165:49.64]Here, eat this person.
[165:51.84]Just eat this person and get some health.
[165:54.74]No, you don't have to eat anybody to get health.
[165:56.54]Here, look.
[166:02.67]No free will.
[166:03.47]Fuck.
[166:03.91]Alright, free will.
[166:04.85]You're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right.
[166:06.33]Yeah, free will, free will.
[166:07.05]Do whatever you want.
[166:09.27]I know what I'm gonna do.
[166:09.94]I have a free will as well.
[166:12.34]I also have a free will.
[166:20.68]Thank you.
[166:33.78]I can't, man.
[166:34.84]This is not helping.
[166:40.58]Oh, no.
[167:02.24]Oh no, he's got a weapon.
[167:04.52]He's got a weapon this time.
[167:05.92]He's got a weapon.
[167:21.93]He's just throwing rocks.
[167:25.61]You learned from the best.
[167:28.75]Can you hit anybody else besides one person?
[167:30.95]He's going to pick the rug up again and throw it, isn't he?
[167:37.39]What is he doing?
[167:49.87]He's getting lit up.
[168:03.11]He's just dying.
[168:06.84]What was the point of coming in here?
[168:10.48]The idiot just goes on his own free will.
[168:22.27]I'm sorry.
[168:25.35]I don't have any jurisdiction here.
[168:26.55]I can't heal him.
[168:29.61]That's why I didn't want him to go in.
[168:32.75]You get fucking annihilated.
[168:36.91]He got mad.
[168:37.65]He threw a rock.
[168:38.37]It didn't hit anybody.
[168:39.05]Threw another rock.
[168:39.89]Missed everybody and got pissed off.
[168:41.39]He didn't even get to... He didn't even get to cast his lightning bolt on anybody.
[168:46.97]And now here we are.
[168:55.32]These games are so fucking funny.
[168:58.32]This is what... What the hell?
[169:00.82]Where do you get...
[169:10.03]Fuck.
[169:10.33]I'm going to make a couple more houses.
[169:30.70]Can I even fit them?
[169:31.72]Yeah, I can.
[169:34.26]Oh, I'm moving in.
[169:35.96]I'm moving in.
[169:41.05]This is so fucking funny.
[169:43.87]Can I build another one?
[169:47.87]Hello?
[169:48.77]Wait, move this tree.
[169:59.06]Hi, neighbor.
[170:10.95]Direct hit.
[170:11.67]That was a perfect shot.
[170:31.72]Oh, the left side.
[170:33.32]Wait a minute.
[170:35.04]Oh my god.
[170:36.88]Oh my god.
[170:40.06]Yep.
[170:40.68]Watch this.
[170:43.54]You don't even fucking know.
[170:44.86]You're about to get Red Alert 2'd, motherfucker.
[171:04.06]That's where the- that's the wonder.
[171:05.30]I have to destroy the wonder.
[171:08.49]Me and Muris are going to go in and we're going to destroy the wonder.
[171:13.32]The 50 year long siege of houses.
[171:22.25]Temple.
[171:23.95]Check this.
[171:29.49]God, how fucking irritating am I?
[171:40.15]This must be so annoying.
[171:48.77]These are the people that you play in an RTS and you're just like, oh, it's this guy.
[171:52.71]This fucking guy.
[171:54.53]Great.
[171:56.15]Well, I know this is going to be not a fun game.
[172:01.85]But, I mean, I know I'm going to beat this guy because he's... He's not fucking good at the game.
[172:07.84]He's not good at the game.
[172:08.64]He's just annoying.
[172:10.51]And sometimes he wins more than he loses because he's fucking irritating.
[172:15.29]There's nothing to do with him playing the game well.
[172:17.29]Like, people just leave his game.
[172:25.35]It's a big-ass tree.
[172:29.99]Just... You can fucking have this.
[172:32.35]I don't care.
[172:32.73]Good hit.
[172:38.81]Okay, I need ore.
[172:42.25]It's the guy that just builds farm skeletons around the map.
[172:49.71]I need ore.
[172:53.60]Anybody have ore?
[172:54.54]Are we out of ore?
[172:56.80]Oh no.
[172:57.20]I don't think there's any more ore.
[173:02.18]Nobody has any?
[173:02.84]Yeah, you gotta have a little bit, right?
[173:09.59]Here we go.
[173:09.97]Yeah, that's enough.
[173:12.31]I got a lot of wood.
[173:15.05]I tried diplomacy.
[173:16.29]It did not do... It didn't... Look at this border.
[173:30.60]I can get in here.
[173:33.64]Alright, I'm in.
[173:35.92]I'm in.
[173:38.00]I gotta get that fucking thing.

[175:46.66]How effective are the siege trees?
[175:50.64]Take it down.
[175:51.04]The whole thing.
[175:51.48]Come on.
[175:52.86]Come on.

[176:10.10]Furious!
[176:28.57]It is no more.
[176:29.15]Everybody in.
[176:42.66]Is it dead?
[176:44.25]Is it actually dead?
[176:50.89]Let's just make double sure.
[176:52.27]Let me get my siege weapon ammo.
[177:19.99]It's in there?
[177:20.45]Fuck.

[177:36.07]Now we just do suppressing fire.

[178:37.86]Take it!
[178:38.16]Take the city!
[178:42.16]The city is ours.
[178:48.98]Excellent work.
[179:00.13]All it took was us getting rid of the Siren Tower with our siege weaponry.
[179:04.65]We're good to go.
[179:07.10]I had so many more resources.
[179:09.67]So much more.
[179:13.61]We claim this land in the name of the Moo Crew.
[179:16.35]Yes, we do.
[179:21.54]There's only one guy.
[179:22.44]That's my suggestion.
[179:23.94]What?
[179:24.22]Burn trees and throw them over?
[179:27.06]Good thing it wasn't raining five minutes ago.
[179:48.83]Oh, they made it!
[179:49.31]Just cap it.
[179:54.31]Just put every single person on here.
[180:03.34]You know, while we're at it... Tell them not to mess with us.
[180:13.54]Hold on, don't do that.
[180:20.50]You didn't kill me!
[180:24.99]They're all cheering.
[180:27.79]This is not the screams of people in the village.
[180:30.73]All these soldiers screaming and cheering like they did it.
[180:33.47]Good game.
[180:44.50]Yes, these brutal Greek armies were as overwhelming to us as they were to the Norse.
[180:52.24]I face the shame of being defeated by them.
[180:57.27]My brother must be told.
[180:59.63]It is like the prophecy.
[181:01.79]These people have a goat.
[181:03.47]I have seen miracles.
[181:05.09]Where's this creature?
[181:08.09]I must go through the portal to find my brother immediately.
[181:12.86]Now we can move on to Nagoyan.
[181:15.48]Click on the gold scroll when you want to leave this land.
[181:21.69]We had a raid?
[181:22.29]Raid from Limealicious.
[181:24.17]Thank you, Lime.
[181:27.09]Welcome, everybody.
[181:27.65]We're playing black and white.
[181:30.67]We just, uh, used a lot of diplomacy.
[181:39.59]I still had that on.
[181:40.31]Let me get rid of that.
[181:41.21]Thanks a lot for the raid.
[181:42.19]Welcome, guys.
[181:44.29]I want to click the scroll.
[181:45.63]I don't want to throw fireballs.
[181:46.61]I still need to build a wonder.
[181:51.15]I didn't do that.
[181:52.79]Any more scrolls that I missed?
[182:08.96]I don't see any scrolls, right?
[182:12.10]Because that's just free favor at this point.
[182:20.33]What's that slap?
[182:22.29]What's that slap thing?
[182:23.65]Somebody had like a CGI?
[182:25.11]That's weird.
[182:38.11]49% evil.
[182:38.79]Yeah, I know.
[182:39.77]It's... Talents taken by force.
[182:43.15]Talents taken by impressiveness.
[182:45.47]Settlements by... See, look.
[182:48.73]50% evil.
[182:50.99]We took 5 by force.
[182:52.59]We took 5 by diplomacy and inspiration.
[182:56.42]Pretty balanced.
[183:01.72]50% happiness.
[183:03.04]Birth rate.
[183:04.90]Highest mana.
[183:08.12]Highest size ring, 30,000.
[183:12.95]Number of deaths, 1,300.

[183:18.47]Player.
[183:19.61]Water Miracles, 30.
[183:22.27]Fire Miracles, 45.
[183:23.89]Healing three times.
[183:28.71]500,000 tributes spent and gained.
[183:35.57]Did most of the side stuff besides build a wonder.
[183:41.35]Alright, Creature.
[183:42.73]Creature Alignment is 80% good, if you could believe it.
[183:46.45]Seven years old.
[183:47.25]He's now 10 feet tall.
[183:49.67]He's now 6,400 pounds.
[183:53.79]He's now very strong, very muscular, very fat, and very fit.
[184:00.41]He's everything.
[184:02.59]Alright, so he's fat, fit, strong, and huge.
[184:06.40]So he's every wrestler from 1985.
[184:16.34]Number of bowel movements, 100.
[184:17.96]That's a perfect score.
[184:22.52]255 kills.
[184:29.89]100 bowel movements.
[184:32.27]Alright, let's keep going.
[184:36.65]100 good poops out of 100, yeah.
[184:44.58]He's about to overflow on kills.
[184:51.83]What's next?
[184:53.23]I could not stand up to the Greeks.
[184:55.57]They overwhelmed us.
[184:58.65]You are a fool.
[185:00.73]With defenses and a strong army, they could have been held at bay.
[185:06.09]No.
[185:06.89]They have some power.
[185:07.97]I think they are good.
[185:09.65]I have seen miracles.
[185:12.53]They have no God.
[185:13.89]You failed.
[185:16.55]No.
[185:17.31]It is as the prophecy says.
[185:18.88]A weak race will survive an onslaught and will rise again with a God to lead it.
[185:27.06]Silence!
[185:28.36]I will deal with these Greeks according to the teachings of war.
[185:33.50]I will let them build, and then I will destroy them.
[185:37.69]Why not destroy them first?
[185:39.33]Why let them build?
[185:43.17]Until we are beaten or we triumph, we must follow the Aztecs.
[185:49.71]It won't be easy to take this land.
[185:52.41]These people are true warriors.
[185:54.13]You should watch out for their ranged weapons.
[185:57.11]These guys think they know war?
[185:59.31]Let's show them how it's done boys.
[186:01.33]I want to get like Armageddon.

[195:18.32]Nice job, there he is.
[195:20.78]Now we need to rebuild.
[195:23.58]What's this?
[195:30.19]My brothers got drunk on our last batch, and now they can't find me.
[195:36.43]Light the fires using our brew, and they can follow them to get me.
[195:43.24]I think it requires to get...

[197:51.51]That's it.
[197:52.42]You gotta be kidding me.
[197:53.12]How's that not it?
[197:59.28]You either go way too hard or way too little, and this is not very much in between.
[198:12.64]That's it, right?
[198:13.62]Oh my god.
[198:26.24]He's gonna come in the frame and be like, that wasn't very good.

[205:46.34]I said it in wrong order.
[205:47.38]Okay.
[205:51.82]He still hasn't built this?
[205:57.69]He's been trying to build this for like two hours.
[206:01.75]Anyways, Bitslave.
[206:03.73]Thanks for the 50 fucking dollars, dude.
[206:06.80]And what did he say?
[206:07.64]He said, PSA, don't drink a whole bottle of Johnny Walker in one night.
[206:10.86]I threw up from 9 a.m.
[206:12.24]to 3 p.m.
[206:12.96]I thought about going to the hospital because I was throwing up bile.
[206:15.71]Holy shit, dude!
[206:22.84]We were trying to tell you to drink some water.
[206:29.48]Don't do that.

[206:31.67]Not good.
[206:36.95]One or two drinks?
[206:38.09]Alright.
[206:39.25]Not a whole bottle.
[206:40.43]You guys, slow down a little.
[206:44.57]You gotta be careful with that.
[206:49.71]Careful, careful, careful with hard alcohol.
[206:51.71]Just drink fucking wine and eat bananas.
[206:56.05]You underestimate my power.
[206:59.56]Remember, that was because of you.
[207:02.66]No, I was saying just still.
[207:04.26]I was saying slow down.
[207:05.80]That was the opposite of what I was saying.
[207:10.74]That's the one right there.
[207:11.53]Nope.
[207:14.13]Anyways, they say, uh... Also, more importantly, I got banned from League.
[207:18.93]Yep.
[207:20.09]We do remember that.
[207:20.77]We do remember that one.
[207:25.27]I got a new account, so if you want to get one too and we can play, go on Jerma, all of us in chat know you want to run down as a Moomoo again.
[207:35.82]I won't play drunk as an added bonus.
[207:37.48]Just kidding.
[207:37.84]Play League on your own.
[207:41.35]If I install League of Legends... Bingo.
[207:43.83]Got it.
[207:45.62]If I install League of Legends, it'll be because... No, I would never do it.
[207:50.44]I just don't... I have no... I could never do it.
[207:54.48]I know I hosted League of Legends for like three straight days.
[207:59.00]That was another reason why.
[208:01.00]First try, please.
[208:07.41]He hates League of Legends.
[208:09.05]No, I just don't want to play it.
[208:12.00]I think I have way less way less a lot less power don't fucking stop me
[208:32.01]Yes!
[208:33.95]Why did I do that?
[208:34.87]Because we were going back and forth.
[208:36.47]Joel and I were raiding each other and we didn't want to have to... None of us were live, so I was like, fuck it, whatever.
[208:40.70]I'll just host the league.
[208:41.38]Who cares?
[208:41.72]It was a joke from like two hours ago in the night.
[208:44.42]It was a joke from like three hours previous in that night.
[208:49.40]40,000 favor.
[208:54.89]Nice.
[208:55.53]Nut oil.
[209:00.29]Alright, now back to it.
[209:01.93]That's a lot of favor, though.
[209:05.16]But Bitslight, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[209:06.68]Take care of yourself.
[209:08.52]Be careful.
[209:11.90]Oh, no.

[209:19.89]Is he...
[209:27.05]Oh, wait, here they come.
[209:28.03]Okay, I have to build a wall.
[209:29.15]Build wall, build wall, build wall.

[209:31.72]No, no, no, Muris, you can't go into like a fat guy food nap.
[209:37.16]No, no, no.
[209:39.08]You gotta get up.
[209:42.67]Get up, get up, get up, get up.
[209:45.01]We're getting trashed.
[209:55.73]He's killing so many people.
[209:58.88]Don't build the wall.
[210:00.40]I'm going to build it right now.
[210:01.56]Nice.
[210:08.02]I didn't even stand a chance.

[210:17.81]Alright, let's put the wall up.
[210:19.53]Their beast seems to be aware of the teachings of war.
[210:23.95]How can this be?
[210:25.46]I don't know.
[210:25.82]That's like the fifth group of people you've sent to die.
[210:28.36]I think it's time for you to figure that out.
[210:30.98]Alright, where should I go?
[210:43.83]Why has the wall started there?
[210:45.07]That seems like a really stupid place for this.
[210:50.23]Why has the wall started here?
[210:57.57]Alright, what if I go over here?
[211:08.70]That's better.
[211:15.66]The teachings say walls around a city are a noose around its neck.
[211:24.02]Low ore on map this time.
[211:25.52]Uh-oh.

[219:42.18]Granary is next.
[219:51.92]Not as evil.
[219:53.50]No, not really.
[220:03.21]Who doesn't have a job?
[220:04.29]I want you to farm.
[220:05.57]Mirrius, you're going to be on... Mirrius, I need you on gathering mine.
[220:13.57]In the mine.
[220:13.91]I can't get in.

[220:41.64]He's so smart, my special boy.
[220:43.70]He's so smart.
[220:46.05]He'll get it eventually.
[220:48.05]He's so smart.
[220:55.29]But we need these trees.
[221:00.44]We need the trees, Murius.
[221:02.26]This... I know, I would be doing the same thing.
[221:06.84]But it's not working.
[221:10.84]Oh, that was very poor.
[221:15.11]How many times is he going to try?
[221:21.51]He's getting pissed.
[221:30.04]What if he runs out of stuff to throw?
[221:38.18]Dude, you... Murius, come on, man.
[221:39.94]Are you, like, pretending?
[221:42.72]So bad.

[221:49.34]So fucking bad.
[222:00.29]I'm gonna let this play out.
[222:01.07]I'm gonna let this play out.
[222:02.25]What happens when he runs out of stuff to throw over the fence?
[222:06.79]Look, he's taunting.
[222:08.27]I think he's tired.
[222:15.63]Yeah, I know.
[222:16.88]I know, it sucks.
[222:20.40]It sucks.
[222:22.30]I think he's pissed at his toys over there.
[222:26.60]You threw it over there, Virius.
[222:35.30]I can't even get his toy back.
[222:36.46]I have no jurisdiction over here.
[222:37.64]He threw it.
[222:40.76]He also threw every tree.
[222:48.33]Why am I doing it now?
[222:54.97]Oh, here we are.
[223:02.99]Okay.
[223:04.05]I don't want to lose those trees.
[223:04.87]There's so many trees back there.
[223:05.79]Okay.
[223:07.05]I have to build a gate.
[223:08.49]Let's get a gate built.

[225:42.33]That's what I'm going to do.

[225:46.79]And he's going to have as many rocks as he wants over here.
[225:51.76]So he can throw rocks over it.
[225:53.26]It's going to be perfect.
[225:54.48]My special fucking cow.
[225:59.82]Plant these over here.
[226:11.10]Okay.
[226:12.46]We need to start to develop stuff.
[226:17.58]How we doing?
[226:18.14]We need food.
[226:19.40]What's the birth rate?
[226:25.87]Birth rate low?
[226:26.81]How?
[226:27.05]People don't have any place to live?
[226:30.75]Any more homes?
[226:34.87]Does that heal?
[226:39.39]I'm trying to get water.
[227:00.93]Did they just plant it?
[227:02.61]Like, how do I make more trees grow?
[227:05.37]And how do I get down here?
[227:14.14]We had big bits.
[227:14.84]Big bits!
[227:16.98]Another $50 donation.
[227:18.16]Jesus.
[227:20.38]5,000 bits from Judge Mortis.
[227:23.28]Thank you, Judge.
[227:25.33]What do you say?
[227:25.95]You say, Recently, more than ever, I felt extremely average and unimportant.
[227:28.95]I feel like when I try to do something, I learn how to do it slower and do it worse than most people.
[227:33.51]I'm unambitious, which has led me not to pursue college.
[227:36.07]A better job, a significant other, etc.
[227:37.41]Do you have any advice other than watching you stream?
[227:40.68]Never a dull moment here.
[227:42.00]Thanks.
[227:45.98]Well... Here's the thing.
[227:53.82]Depending on what you like to do It sounds like it sounds like you might be you know, you're not passionate about very many things correct me if I'm wrong You kind of have to find something that you are very very passionate about That you really really care about
[228:18.84]And then those things that you really care about, you'll never feel that way because you really like it.
[228:25.13]It doesn't even have to be potentially for work or for a job.
[228:27.93]If you really enjoy something, do it.
[228:32.23]Make yourself happy.
[228:33.47]Try to make yourself feel better.
[228:34.85]Make yourself happy about something.
[228:38.77]Try to truly care about something.
[228:44.93]Because...
[228:47.48]When you start throwing darts, that's when you can get into trouble.
[228:52.10]You know, oh, I want a significant other.
[228:54.42]That's one thing to put time into.
[228:56.36]I want a better job.
[228:58.76]I want to go to college.
[229:00.89]I want all these things.
[229:02.67]I need them all.
[229:03.87]Right?
[229:06.79]You almost have to focus on one thing that you know you want to do.
[229:18.74]And the other things might come.
[229:19.94]You're talking about like significant other.
[229:23.04]I didn't have a girlfriend or anything for like eight years.
[229:25.38]It's great.
[229:28.00]It kind of just happened.
[229:29.04]Kim and I just sort of happened.
[229:30.30]I didn't even try.
[229:31.16]I wasn't even trying.
[229:33.36]You just don't know what's going to happen.
[229:35.22]But all you can do is try to stay passionate and try to care about something.
[229:40.10]And try to do it.
[229:48.37]There's no real secret recipe, I don't think.
[229:56.60]That was a humble... Wait, I just told you I didn't have a girlfriend for like 10 years.
[230:02.18]How's it... Hey guys, you know, look at me.
[230:04.48]I haven't had a girlfriend in 10 years until Kim came along.
[230:08.56]That's not... I was head bragging.
[230:10.94]That's just real life.
[230:14.15]Actually, I want to take some of you guys away.
[230:20.79]Disciple Farmer.
[230:25.88]Disciple Farmer.
[230:28.92]You said you didn't have to try.
[230:29.96]Disciple Farmer.
[230:33.30]Oh, oh wait, hold on.
[230:34.10]People at the gate, wait.
[230:34.90]Oh, I see what you're saying.
[230:36.73]No, I mean like I wasn't pursuing it.
[230:39.99]It sort of just happened.
[230:42.68]And I tried.
[230:43.97]You guys remember the Tinder years.
[230:46.17]I was on Tinder.
[230:47.03]I was on dating websites trying to... I got stood up on a fucking date from Tinder.
[230:52.05]We already went over that.
[230:53.61]I was trying.
[230:55.28]And the moment that I just stopped trying for some reason, it was like, okay, a few months later, I just met this person at a Christmas party.
[231:08.89]And it's not like I gave up on Tinder or anything like that.
[231:11.09]It was just I... It wasn't a priority for me anymore.
[231:19.90]Tinder is garbage.
[231:21.26]Yeah, Tinder is 75% bots.
[231:22.16]10% people making accounts just to see what happens.
[231:31.01]Like, they're not... Oh, I'm just gonna make a Tinder.
[231:33.58]I match with this person?
[231:34.84]Well, alright, cool.
[231:36.70]How many matches did I have today?
[231:38.29]That's it.
[231:40.07]And, like, 4% people that want to, like, go on dates.
[231:54.58]More like 1%.
[231:56.78]It's a hookup app.
[231:58.22]No, it's a place to get, uh, bought phone numbers to datamine your fucking cell phone.
[232:12.48]But to put a cap on that, I should have paused the game, actually, because a lot of time just went by.
[232:18.13]To put a cap on that, it's hard to...
[232:22.82]It's hard to give advice on stuff like this because I don't really know the answers.
[232:26.21]I don't really have them.
[232:29.95]I wish I did.
[232:32.33]All I can tell you is experiences that I've had.
[232:34.81]And some of them are fairly fucking strange.
[232:40.36]I wish I had a way to answer better.
[232:48.22]Wait, Jeremy, you're not an internet psychologist?
[232:53.75]I feel like I have some experiences that can maybe help people or try to tell them how I did things, but I did things really strange.
[233:00.46]Uh-oh.
[233:08.37]Uh-oh.
[233:19.89]Did you try Bumble?
[233:21.51]No, I was out of the game by the time Bumble was, like, really a thing that everyone talked about.
[233:27.37]Look at how much food I have.
[233:28.31]Alright, start breeding.
[233:30.13]Nobody has any houses to breed in.
[233:31.33]Okay, I gotta breed.
[233:37.21]Standard houses.
[233:37.81]Install Tinder on all their phones.
[233:48.83]They don't need Tinder on their phones.
[233:50.09]They all live in the same square mile.
[233:52.59]Okay, more houses.
[234:14.44]Oh, they can't get in.
[234:15.50]There's a gate.
[234:20.86]Look at all these resources.
[234:22.06]I'm starving.
[234:24.46]Alright, yeah, yeah, get off, get off.
[234:25.74]You can do whatever you want.

[234:39.09]Go to Taco Bell.
[234:49.08]I gotta put, like, a...
[234:51.41]market or something down here for people.
[235:12.26]Why is the ground consecrated?
[235:16.98]Why is the ground consecrated?
[235:20.75]Is it because I'm evil?
[235:28.74]Oh.
[235:28.84]I'm only 50%, y'all.
[235:29.94]The ground's at like 50% consecrated.
[235:31.80]I see.
[235:32.54]The opacity on the consecration is like 50%.
[235:34.14]I get it.
[235:34.84]Alright, more houses.
[235:39.00]I can't build them on the cliff.
[235:40.20]Come on.
[235:40.82]Alright, let's get something down here.
[235:56.16]Feed Garfield more people.

[236:13.12]Another nursery.
[236:19.50]Nursery here.
[236:21.00]We'll do a nursery down here as well.
[236:23.40]I want to be just pumping the population up like crazy.
[236:27.84]Gotta go out further with like something else.
[236:29.58]Put it up here.
[236:30.44]No.

[237:05.81]Give me back, give me back!
[237:07.73]Fuck.
[237:09.25]What are you doing?
[237:39.81]Uh-oh.
[237:45.19]Here we go again.
[237:47.19]He needs rocks, man.
[237:58.97]Do we have any rocks?
[238:01.53]There has to be like a rock he can pick up or something that's not the trees we need.
[238:19.78]It's not doing anything, Murius.
[238:22.42]New strategy.
[238:24.68]New strategy.
[238:42.38]Oh, the door's open!
[239:03.13]He's gonna start a huge fire.
[239:15.00]No, stop.
[239:25.80]I let him in, I'm trying to let him out.
[239:44.96]Don't run away!
[239:45.78]Where are you going?
[239:50.24]Why are you running away?
[239:51.90]What's the point of this?
[239:54.14]What was the purpose of this?
[239:57.43]You fucking idiot!
[240:07.13]Stop!
[240:07.61]You're gonna break the fucking wall!
[240:19.51]He's out of control.
[240:21.55]He's out of fucking control.
[240:22.61]Close the gate.
[240:23.01]He's spoiled.
[240:23.45]No, I think he's just kind of dopey.
[240:25.75]How we doing?

[241:36.48]Mansion.
[241:39.78]How much is Fire?
[241:41.22]90.
[241:41.36]Should I hold off and give him Fire, or should I invest in Mansions?
[241:54.25]I don't know.
[241:59.53]Probably mansions.
[242:05.24]That's more practical.
[242:06.82]Alright.
[242:08.20]Murius can heal now.
[242:11.98]But we need more room.
[242:13.02]We need more houses.

[242:31.78]Alright, what does it need?
[242:39.37]1200 wood, 400 ore.
[243:05.35]I think I just killed somebody.
[243:13.62]No, Mirrius, it's not gathering ore if you take it out of the store.
[243:17.34]This ore is- it's empty.
[243:40.91]Alright, we need more mansions.
[243:41.85]And then I'm going to build the military.
[243:43.79]I need wood.
[243:48.47]We have so much food, but so little wood.
[243:56.15]I need to build like a lumber mill.
[243:57.87]Alright, that's next.
[244:01.44]Okay.

[259:12.68]Is there another mine?
[259:13.44]No.
[259:20.61]Oh, this is really bad.

[261:23.93]I'm focusing.
[261:28.03]How do I want to build this out?
[261:30.36]Because I have no ore.
[261:31.24]How the fuck am I going to do this?
[261:39.50]Does the temple need ore?
[261:47.25]Two temples.

[265:01.70]Just fucking do two temples.
[265:03.80]I'm doing another temple.
[265:04.66]What's the worst that could happen?
[265:05.92]Is this a bad idea?
[265:06.52]Because this is a huge amount of influence than just building a bunch of houses down here.
[265:19.99]Plant the trees.
[265:21.93]I mean, I was, but he kept on taking them out of their roots.
[265:28.03]Plant trees?
[265:28.91]I will.
[265:29.43]I will.
[265:29.79]Hold on.
[265:32.46]Our mighty creature will lead our warriors into battle.
[265:36.82]The Greeks will soon regret coming here.
[265:39.12]Okay, here.
[265:39.58]What do you mean, our mighty creature?
[265:43.26]Don't gather.
[265:44.74]I want you to just relax.
[265:46.50]In fact, just go sleep.
[265:48.87]Alright, put that down.
[265:51.11]Do not... Don't take trees.
[265:53.11]How do I say stop taking trees?
[265:57.65]Do not take a tree.
[266:00.78]I'll attack enemy soldiers whenever I see them.
[266:02.98]No, no, don't do that.
[266:04.12]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[266:07.73]I just have like red, I have purple paint on my hands.
[266:14.19]No!
[266:21.11]Because he's ripping the trees up to throw them at the people.
[266:26.19]I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[266:31.24]Okay, here we go.
[266:36.82]The trees are getting cut down now.
[266:44.41]Looking for a spot to put it next to houses.
[266:49.33]He's pissed.
[266:51.55]He's just still doing it.
[267:04.99]Look at me!
[267:16.07]Okay.
[267:18.36]Put.
[267:18.82]It.
[267:19.36]Down.
[267:22.38]Put it down.
[267:29.37]I just caught it out of my fucking hand!
[267:51.81]Get over there.
[267:52.51]And just stay there.
[267:54.23]You're in timeout.
[268:15.58]You're going to be like, I don't want to be down here.
[268:19.60]Well, don't do crazy shit.
[268:29.52]Just wait till I get out of here.
[268:33.34]I'm going to make your life a living hell, dad.
[268:35.41]Okay.
[268:41.53]Trees.
[268:42.77]We're impressive.
[268:43.59]We're cool.
[268:44.53]People like us.
[268:48.08]Is this done?
[268:50.90]Alright.
[268:51.24]Now we're going to build some roads out this way.
[268:59.61]Don't think we can.
[269:00.35]Hold on.
[269:01.07]This is what I made.
[269:01.85]Good.
[269:02.07]This is what I made this for.
[269:10.05]Continue this way.
[269:11.64]4,500.
[269:15.64]Not enough.
[269:25.80]Let's do a another nursery because I need a second one I have a lot of kids being born only one nursery This is just wood
[269:55.81]The Greeks continue to expand.
[269:58.95]My brother was right to admire them.
[270:01.31]Here we go.
[270:01.73]But we cannot allow this to continue.
[270:03.47]I'm starting to drain.
[270:04.27]Send out raiding parties.
[270:06.07]I'm starting to drain influence.
[270:10.15]From almost both.
[270:11.11]We're going to have both these towns.
[270:15.09]What is the most needed thing at the moment?
[270:20.62]Armory.
[270:21.12]People want an armory.
[270:24.36]Alright, fine.
[270:44.83]We can plant more trees over here.
[270:45.90]Use some of them.
[271:00.07]Oh.
[271:03.29]Uh.
[271:05.30]Wait.
[271:37.60]Go!

[272:33.41]No, no, no, no, no.
[272:33.97]Don't run through the fire.
[273:10.31]What is going on?
[273:18.27]Just stomp and you'll be fine.
[273:20.27]Stomp.
[273:21.56]Stomp.
[273:23.02]Stomp.
[273:24.16]Step on him.
[273:34.45]No, I wanted you to pick up the rock.
[273:50.62]He can't be stopped.
[273:54.02]I don't even know what to say anymore.
[273:56.72]Bring that rock behind the gate.
[274:00.81]I need you to have it so then you can have something to play with.
[274:28.94]Leave him outside?

[275:35.56]He's so scary.
[275:37.14]He's so scary.
[275:42.19]What is his face?
[275:57.81]Okay, let him just do this.
[275:58.97]I don't care.
[276:02.19]Teach him to heal people.

[277:18.07]I just want to watch.
[277:18.95]I don't even care about anything else.
[277:20.35]This is like the most entertaining thing.
[277:26.11]I just like watching him make his own opinions.
[277:37.29]Here comes another attack.
[277:49.54]We need houses, actually.
[277:50.53]Oops.

[281:21.33]Why did I teach him to hate trees?
[281:27.22]I didn't.
[281:27.90]He just does.
[281:29.36]He saw me throw a bunch of shit and now he hates everything.
[281:33.44]Here, eat some more food.

[283:25.34]A graveyard.
[283:31.62]Nobody wants a graveyard near them.
[283:34.02]Put it back here.
[283:34.64]No.
[283:34.70]Nobody wants a graveyard.
[283:37.90]Why are these people happy about a graveyard?
[283:44.01]Their beast seems to be aware of the teachings of war.
[283:48.43]How can this be?
[283:49.83]Does that mean he's eating people?
[283:51.09]The Greeks have a graveyard.
[283:54.27]They will need it.
[283:57.86]Gonna have some fun with that tree.
[284:00.22]Good.
[284:08.36]The Greeks have a graveyard.
[284:10.04]They will need it.

[288:22.68]No, he's alright.
[288:24.72]He's given so much combat skill.
[288:27.66]It seems they know how to fight.
[288:33.75]I don't know.
[288:34.77]It's wild.
[288:35.37]I can't believe it either.

[291:47.49]Go inspect it.
[291:48.65]He can't get there, is he?
[291:49.65]Well, you've blocked the path with so many trees.
[291:52.85]He's blocked it.
[291:54.67]He's uprooted every single tree to a point where he can't move.
[292:05.18]Okay.

[293:28.32]Need a road going over here.
[293:35.19]Is it blocked by trees?
[293:37.05]Shouldn't be.
[293:37.43]Alright, what do they have for resources?
[293:49.06]Go to sleep.
[293:52.42]Wait, are they having... I think they're having sex.

[296:41.71]I can't get there.
[296:45.79]Shit, really?
[296:46.39]Yes you can.

[299:59.17]He's delusional.
[300:00.29]He's on drugs.

[302:13.34]Is that him to free will?
[302:17.50]He's at free will.
[302:18.20]He gets to do whatever he wants.
[302:29.04]We'll check back on him later.
[302:30.08]I need to build some stuff.
[302:31.74]Need more... We gotta start to go forward, I think.
[302:35.29]Because there's nothing else to get.
[302:38.07]The only thing that's left to get is to continue up this way, but... I guess I could... Maybe get all this?
[302:48.03]I'm going to go smash that like button.
[302:52.87]If I get enough influence here, maybe they'll join?
[302:55.19]But... I don't know.
[302:56.55]I'm out of materials.
[303:02.51]What's the play here if I'm out of materials?
[303:05.57]Do I have to just make some military and try to go forward?
[303:10.45]And try to take one of these other towns that are up here?
[303:12.63]Look at all that, they have so much military.
[303:23.46]Just plant trees, it's free.
[303:28.30]Send in the cow.
[303:32.20]Impress the village.
[303:33.18]Alright, let me... I just unlocked some new things.
[303:39.84]Where are they?
[303:42.90]Well, column.
[303:43.82]How much does this cost?
[303:44.80]I mean, these are tiny.
[303:48.82]Let's put them everywhere.
[303:56.82]Should I just put these fucking everywhere?
[303:58.22]How much do they cost?
[304:03.22]150 ore, ah, that's not good Not the old folks home Impressiveness
[304:32.36]Looking for cheap, impressive shit.
[304:35.66]100.
[304:35.74]That's a well ore.
[304:36.72]That's too much.
[304:37.26]Tavern is... Stop doing that.
[304:42.63]Torture pit.
[304:44.29]Stop moving to the right and left.
[304:49.95]These are 20 and free.
[304:54.49]Yeah, but I need to have a place to put them.
[305:01.18]So I'm just gonna build a shitload of houses?
[305:02.90]I'm gonna build a shitload of just crappy houses and plant trees all over them.
[305:09.55]You're going up a little too far, Furious.
[305:11.13]You don't have to go up this far.
[305:15.25]That was nuts.
[305:16.33]They just got killed against the fucking wall.
[305:22.08]You okay?
[305:27.69]Alright, that's the strategy.
[305:29.67]That's what I'm gonna do.
[305:31.48]It begins.
[305:32.88]The cheapest house I can buy that's like a hundred wood.
[305:36.82]We will avenge your death, honorable warriors.
[305:41.98]Their beast seems to be aware of the teachings of war.
[305:47.12]320.
[305:47.42]Let's go.
[305:52.78]Villas?
[305:54.66]That is no way for a warrior to live.
[305:59.80]Doesn't matter.
[306:00.22]Let's go.
[306:04.98]Give me the wood.
[306:07.00]I'm gonna start a train.
[306:15.23]Give me a ton of wood.
[306:16.01]Let's go.
[306:22.45]Scam train incoming.
[306:25.64]I'll connect all this later when I have more of an idea of what's going on.
[306:30.06]The road will be going this way.
[306:32.41]And I'll connect up to this road.
[306:33.65]Why am I getting negative impressive points for this?
[306:51.72]Why is this negative?
[307:06.86]Because I have mansions.
[307:10.22]Okay, let's connect to the road.
[307:13.98]Oops.
[307:18.54]Didn't want to do that, but it's okay.
[307:22.03]Alright, keep going.
[307:25.41]-2.
[307:36.42]Keep going.
[307:41.23]The thing is, it's just wood, and then I'm gonna put trees fucking along every row.
[307:45.85]And people will be so impressed that I was able to build 500 houses in 30 minutes.
[307:54.83]I'll get it.
[307:55.57]I'll get your food.
[307:56.13]Hold on.
[308:12.14]Alright, let's pause for a second.
[308:13.64]Let's get some food going.
[308:15.30]I want another storehouse.
[308:17.98]Storehouse is going over here.
[308:24.30]Nobody lives in this one.
[308:25.24]That's okay.
[308:25.98]Alright, tree time.
[308:27.30]You ready?
[308:33.42]Let's get a road out here first.
[308:34.96]Oh boy, I can't get a road out here.
[308:41.01]Can I?
[308:48.82]This is too big.
[308:52.32]Oh, come on.
[308:57.64]I gotta make this smaller.
[308:58.46]I gotta get rid of the farm and then make it different.
[309:07.82]I know it sucks, but I have to.
[309:08.76]I can't.
[309:15.49]Everything has to be connected.
[309:19.22]I can't... Why?
[309:22.62]What are you talking about?
[309:23.36]What are you talking about?
[309:25.34]What are you talking about?
[309:33.54]Why not?
[309:44.38]What's the problem?
[309:53.00]Is there like a level feature or something where I can just smack down all this bullshit?
[310:09.61]Oh, come on.
[310:10.69]It's right there.
[310:11.63]Just jump.
[310:13.88]Just fucking jump.
[310:15.08]Just jump.
[310:47.63]No, I want the one behind it.
[311:00.47]How is this one not worth 20 points?
[311:03.54]Is it not big enough?
[311:07.19]What the fuck?
[311:07.65]What is Murius doing?
[311:09.19]Grinding XP.
[311:09.85]Why can't I put any more trees down here?
[311:59.40]I have a ton of trees that are not doing anything over here.
[312:01.58]Is it even going to munch on those trees?
[312:15.48]Imagine just planting trees.
[312:17.30]And it's enough to make everybody love you.
[312:22.75]I guess that actually is kind of accurate, though.
[312:25.11]Like, we gotta protect these fucking things, you know what I mean?
[312:30.35]That's pretty admirable.
[312:49.00]All along the wall, too.
[312:53.91]No?
[312:54.27]Oh, yeah, it was.
[312:54.83]Okay.
[312:59.30]Okay.
[313:02.64]How long do I have to do this for?
[313:03.64]He's like, hey, let me in.
[313:14.37]Forever.
[313:14.79]Oh.
[313:16.49]Oh.
[313:19.52]I wonder what games, what is it?
[313:22.31]Sometimes I do stuff with trees.
[313:31.44]Whatever, man.
[313:57.34]Alright, is there a way I can look to see if this is working?
[314:00.98]Or do I just have to assume this is gonna work?
[314:06.86]Irma's speaking for the trees.
[314:11.55]I guess I'll poop on the trees.
[314:14.51]Good, that's fertilizer.
[314:17.31]Jingle Forest Jester?
[314:20.37]Nah, I don't think I will.
[314:23.91]Nah, I don't think I will.
[314:31.81]Killed ya?
[314:32.23]You can't kill me.
[314:35.31]I have... I have a pardon from the king.
[314:37.47]He's the one that gets to tell if that happens or not, and he hasn't decided that.
[314:48.65]Sorry!
[315:00.84]Okay.
[315:02.60]How much impressiveness do I have?
[315:03.78]I'm just like putting fucking trees down.
[315:06.54]I'm no better than Murius right now.
[315:08.62]That's all I'm doing.
[315:10.34]What is this doing for me?
[315:11.38]14,000.
[315:14.65]Impressiveness required to capture... So I need 5,000 more impressiveness.
[315:25.53]This shit's gonna take all day.
[315:26.61]There's not enough room to get 5,000 points for this.

[321:59.35]Oh, I didn't say that they- I didn't say Chili's was bad, I just said that they were- well, yeah, I did.
[322:05.01]Although, wait, wait, wait, I will rephrase my statement here.

[322:18.22]Is that still happening?
[322:21.28]It's like 20 bucks for two full entrees?
[322:23.28]Do they still do that?

[323:41.07]What do you mean?
[323:41.53]How?
[323:50.22]Is there anything else more efficient than this?

[346:57.59]On the wall.
[347:11.93]Just free kills.
[347:13.87]Don't even need Murius.
[347:19.36]Okay.
[347:22.38]Now, we're almost at a level of impressiveness that is insurmountable.
[347:29.45]We need... What?
[347:35.27]Where's... Did I already take it?
[347:39.33]Where is it?
[347:42.77]Where's that town, Iga?
[347:44.87]What happened to Iga?
[347:55.59]What?
[347:57.50]They're on their way.
[347:59.92]Are they?
[348:04.74]From where?
[348:07.54]Oh, they're right there.
[348:11.05]You guys were a long way away.
[348:13.91]Is this Iga?
[348:18.35]What?
[348:19.43]You... I gotta protect them?
[348:26.30]They got a free run.
[348:27.42]They'll be alright.
[348:28.68]Look, I have archers just killing them.
[348:31.02]They can't even do anything.
[348:35.58]Alright, man.
[348:36.42]Let me...
[348:38.22]Let's start... I'm gonna start smashing food.
[348:43.56]Water.
[348:43.86]I'm gonna do my own crops.
[348:47.18]Check this out.
[348:47.82]Let's get this happening.
[349:08.35]It's gonna get used pretty quickly, but I'm gonna stockpile it.
[349:22.59]Useful powers.
[349:24.98]Oh, that's alright.
[349:35.74]Just look at how it's getting eaten before I can even do anything about it.
[349:50.14]You're coming... No, no, don't gather the grain.
[349:52.10]Put grain in, Murius.
[349:53.62]Put grain in.
[349:58.08]Get out of the way.
[350:04.56]Let's do... Let's do that two or three more times.
[350:17.81]Got a lot of mana.
[350:25.97]Population increases impressiveness.
[350:28.53]I'm burning through so much food right now, though.
[350:31.11]I gotta... I gotta get a good baseline food.
[350:36.61]Okay, that should be alright for a little while.
[350:42.83]At least for now.
[350:46.49]In fact, here.
[350:47.07]You guys are on your own now, but just take another miracle or two.
[351:05.52]Okay, there we go.
[351:08.22]Where do all these trees come from?
[351:09.30]Has he just been planting trees over here?
[351:19.90]Alright, we need...
[351:29.05]35.
[351:29.11]I think we have two different groups coming over this way.
[351:33.75]There's one.
[351:36.79]Is there more than one coming?
[351:38.31]Or is it just that one?
[351:40.21]I thought there were two that were really close to each other.
[351:47.01]Alright, more houses.
[351:52.74]Let's put some houses down here.
[351:54.50]Wood-based houses only.
[352:00.55]Let's get some breeding going.
[352:01.75]Pregnancies.
[352:02.29]Come on.
[352:07.69]Stop having kids.
[352:11.43]Nursery.
[352:11.79]I'll put a nursery down here too.
[352:13.34]Population is impressive.
[352:14.60]Disciple refiner.
[352:18.76]Disciple refiner.
[352:31.89]Remember what?
[352:33.41]Just go to war?
[352:35.11]I can't.
[352:35.51]Remember, message is important.
[352:36.81]What are you talking about?
[352:39.96]What message are you talking about?
[352:51.44]The most recent message?
[352:52.62]Disciple breeder.
[353:04.96]It's time for... It's just a joke times a thousand.
[353:08.45]But the last message?
[353:10.55]I'm just trying to make children, for God's sake.
[353:14.95]This is where we have to really, really start to go nuts.
[353:29.40]Because...
[353:34.92]I... Are they still alive out here?
[353:39.62]Alright, Marius.
[353:44.20]I know, you think... It's very funny.
[353:45.50]I'll put that back.
[353:51.07]Don't kill all the children in the nursery with a tree.
[353:54.37]It's not funny, Marius.
[353:56.61]It's not funny.
[354:07.58]Furious, I need you out here.
[354:13.55]On your... I need you to fight.
[354:15.79]Because I'm going to get a new... I don't want them to get killed.
[354:20.47]I want them to come in safely.
[354:22.71]Let's get back over here.
[354:40.27]Is this because I didn't read the message?
[354:42.61]I did read the message.
[354:45.69]And I laughed so fucking hard.
[354:53.62]No, no more throwing!
[354:54.64]Stop, stop, stop.
[354:57.64]Is he healing the people of... What is going on?
[355:14.62]He's throwing them backwards.
[355:18.24]Did he heal the guys on the rafters?
[355:23.71]I have no idea.
[355:29.64]Alright, close the gate.
[355:41.37]Perfect timing.
[355:42.41]Don't bounce into the wall, please.
[355:43.93]Good.
[355:44.11]Alright, here they are.
[355:46.85]It's time to increase our impressiveness.
[355:48.51]Hopefully they get here before this... Come on, hurry up.
[355:52.01]In fact, Murius, just go meet them out there.
[355:57.09]Go meet them halfway.
[355:59.23]There's old people.
[356:00.95]There's old people and children.
[356:01.97]You have to meet them halfway.
[356:03.11]How can this be?
[356:13.99]Who's that?
[356:17.14]He's gonna kill this lady here.
[356:19.62]Oh, he missed him.
[356:20.60]Oh my god, thank god.
[356:25.04]Okay, at least the kid got out.
[356:27.34]The kid got away.
[356:30.62]Come on, keep going guys.
[356:36.29]Okay, the kid got away, good.
[356:39.54]They have trebuchets up top, too.
[356:41.00]Alright.
[356:41.66]Move, move, move.
[356:42.22]Get out.
[356:48.60]I welcome you.
[356:54.50]Open the door.
[356:55.24]Let them in.
[356:59.72]Free will.
[357:09.39]Okay, let's let him in.
[357:12.77]I don't want you to... No, no, no.
[357:13.91]I don't want you to eat a villager.
[357:14.99]We have to show them that we're nice people.
[357:16.91]He's planted so many trees out here.
[357:19.03]Look at all this bullshit.
[357:20.76]They're fucking everywhere.
[357:23.14]He was out here just bored.
[357:25.00]Planting trees.
[357:28.48]Let them in.
[357:33.37]Holy shit, that was 20,000 ore.
[357:38.14]No, you're not going to eat a villain.
[357:44.72]Okay, I just got a lot of ore.
[357:45.84]Where's the hurricane?
[357:52.09]I hope he misses.
[357:53.71]I hope it's like an incorrect and it just goes like the wrong way.
[358:05.57]Wait a minute, who the fuck are you?
[358:11.81]Who is this motherfucker?
[358:12.90]Murius.
[358:18.52]Murius.
[358:19.72]Turn on the fucking hate.
[358:20.66]Turn on the hate, Murius.
[358:25.83]It's time for you to go kick ass.
[358:28.37]Look at how, look at how, he is so much bigger than him.
[358:30.63]He is nothing to you.
[358:33.62]Yeah, he's running away.
[358:34.46]Look at him.
[358:34.76]He's pure.
[358:35.18]He looks like you.
[358:36.00]He looks like you before the gym.
[358:39.96]Yeah, get the fuck out of here.
[358:42.71]He's running away.
[358:53.41]Came all the way down here to see.
[359:01.77]Alright, I'm gonna make a ton of archers.
[359:03.61]Because I have the ore for it now.
[359:05.99]I need to have some defense.
[359:08.33]Oh my god, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[359:11.00]Let's put like 70 fucking archers up here.
[359:14.58]No one will ever get in.
[359:22.81]And then... Now, let's also... We gotta have some more food here.
[359:35.53]How are we doing now?
[359:39.74]We need 3200 to get the next town.
[359:41.46]We need some impressive shit.
[359:45.40]Alright, what's really impressive?
[359:51.48]Universities?
[359:52.60]Oh yeah.
[359:53.50]Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[359:54.55]No, not a torture device.
[359:56.49]Universities.
[360:01.15]We will get so many towns.
[360:06.18]Right there.
[360:06.80]Boom.
[360:07.94]There will be much for us to learn from this university.
[360:11.16]I'm just going to build like three of these and we'll take it.
[360:17.17]That's it.
[360:17.55]It's over.

[361:11.73]Put it right here.
[361:17.67]Yes, we have.
[361:22.47]Violence is not the answer unless they come to you and Murius kills probably 400 to 500 people.
[361:27.81]I can't wait to see the end of this one because Murius probably has like 600 kills this game.
[361:32.41]What did we get?

[365:20.63]Alright, now I need... A little bit more ore.
[365:32.12]That was the game saver right there.
[365:34.50]I'll tell you.
[365:35.94]Taking that town and not giving up.
[365:37.94]I was gonna restart the mission.
[365:40.85]I didn't have to hurt anybody.
[365:44.99]I didn't have to hurt a single person.
[366:01.84]Wait, 500 subs?
[366:04.68]500 subs.
[366:05.88]Holy shit.
[366:07.54]You know what that means?
[366:08.82]Penis stream!
[366:11.48]Alright.
[366:11.82]Thanks for the 500 subs.
[366:13.92]That's what it means.
[366:15.32]You came to the right stream.
[366:16.52]You came to a penis stream.
[366:18.07]Okay, guys, here we go.
[366:19.19]Hope you get your pogs ready.
[366:21.07]Get your pogs ready.
[366:22.69]Okay, get your pogs ready.
[366:25.56]Get your pogs ready.
[366:48.49]Is it working?
[366:52.26]Can you hear that?
[366:53.86]Oh, fuck.
[366:56.88]Fuck, fuck, fuck.
[367:03.08]Okay, get your pogs ready.
[367:05.84]Get your pogs.
[367:06.52]It's time for a penis stream.
[367:07.74]You know what that means.
[367:08.63]It's time.
[367:21.09]I fucked it up.
[367:45.27]That's the face you make when a pigeon flies down when you're eating lunch.
[367:51.65]And flies into your face.
[368:05.91]Freddy Dredd just gave a fucking ton of money.
[368:09.65]Freddy Dredd just gave $110 in bits.
[368:10.69]He just gave 11,000 bits.
[368:11.31]I have to pause the game.
[368:12.21]The game's not even paused.
[368:27.54]Love you, Jerma man.
[368:28.40]Hope you're having a good stream.
[368:29.36]Got paid today, so I'm giving back.
[368:32.48]Seems like you got some, seems like you got some paper there.
[368:36.10]You got some cash.
[368:43.00]Holy shit, man.
[368:43.90]Seriously, thank you.
[368:46.47]Wink scammed?
[368:49.37]Hold on, first of all, can I not have, like, dickhead hair?
[368:56.09]I tried to fix it and it just made it worse.
[369:03.13]Penis hair.
[369:10.02]225 subs and hundreds of dollars in bits.
[369:16.30]Penis hair.
[369:17.08]That doesn't even make any sense.
[369:18.58]Alright, stop getting me banned from Twitch, okay?
[369:29.92]There's two groups that are coming down.
[369:33.44]We got this one.
[369:34.10]We got that one.
[369:37.34]No violence.
[369:42.96]Anus hair does not make sense.
[369:44.52]I didn't say it.
[369:45.90]I was responding to somebody else that said it.
[369:47.87]That's strange.
[369:49.01]I agree with you.
[369:56.85]Dude, I'm going to take over everything.
[369:59.59]It's all going to be mine.
[370:03.72]What else has huge impressiveness?
[370:08.34]I'm just going to start building columns.
[370:12.88]These are what, 100 each?
[370:14.60]How much ore are they?
[370:15.21]150 and it's 180.
[370:17.61]I think I can do it right now.
[370:28.43]Games.
[370:29.15]Oh, sorry.
[370:33.87]Is this worth doing you think?
[370:41.26]I gotta do a test run here.
[370:45.28]I've gotta do a test run.
[370:53.01]a test run like the movie about the blue animal when they released the first trailer and people weren't happy with it it was sort of a test for the future and then they ended up changing it into what the character is now which then progressed into from what I've heard one of the what is it
[371:26.19]Oh, sorry.
[371:46.30]You had to be here four and a half hours ago.
[371:48.76]Look at all these fucking... Burius, go out here and eat all these fucking bodies.
[371:59.89]I was sick.
[372:03.32]Alright, can I beat this?
[372:07.76]I've only got s- Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[372:09.30]You're distracting me.
[372:11.38]God, stop distracting me.
[372:14.68]I'm busy if you don't see on your damn screen.
[372:22.91]Hey, you boy, 10 community subs.
[372:24.35]Thanks a lot, you boy.
[372:30.96]Thanks for the 10.
[372:31.48]77.
[372:32.26]Alright, it's not 80.
[372:34.22]Thanks for the 10 subs.
[372:40.65]75.
[372:40.83]Still worth doing for a little bit.
[372:43.53]74.
[372:43.55]Okay, hold on.
[372:45.89]Wait, wait, wait.
[372:46.89]This is Column City.
[372:51.11]It's not worth it, is it?
[372:52.31]How much is University worth?
[372:56.38]I used points.
[372:57.32]You have to look at this.
[373:05.62]University's worth like 700.
[373:09.49]It's 504 for a university.
[373:16.46]Are they here?
[373:16.84]They're not here yet.
[373:18.94]They'll be here in a second.
[373:21.47]Somebody...
[373:35.67]It's definitely more cost-effective to do this, at least for now.
[373:37.91]A couple more universities and some more houses.
[373:41.33]Alright, I gotta give her some of Murius's trees.
[373:44.44]He went way overboard.
[373:47.00]Just overboard.
[373:47.70]578.
[373:47.72]Okay.
[374:00.59]Okay.
[374:09.59]578.
[374:09.71]It's 500 ore to do it.
[374:11.53]I almost got another town.
[374:23.10]What else do I not have diminishing returns of?
[374:27.15]1500 ore, but it's probably going to be at least... It'll be probably... It'll be a lot.
[374:35.27]Let's move up.
[374:40.87]It'll be, like, probably 1,200.
[374:41.61]We'll put in a temple here.
[374:53.90]I'm gonna put another wall up here.
[374:55.12]Yeah, there's gonna be a wall before the wall.
[374:56.96]It'll be like when you go with the guys in, like, the hazmat suits go into, like, the room before the room and, like, the steam goes on them.
[375:04.67]Which, I'm not even sure if that was an anti-bacterial agent.
[375:06.47]I don't even know what that's supposed to be.
[375:22.64]Don't kill them, please.
[375:25.88]I got so many archers, they're not going to do shit.
[375:33.31]They didn't have anything.
[375:34.47]They didn't have anything.
[375:35.45]They had nothing.
[375:37.01]They had 160... They had 160 pieces of snacks.
[375:41.35]Really?
[375:41.59]Alright, sorry.
[375:42.61]No, you're welcome.
[375:43.17]Everyone's welcome.
[375:43.85]Come on in.
[375:48.11]Except for that guy.
[375:48.61]That guy's running very fast.
[375:55.19]Kill that guy, please.
[375:57.83]Okay, somebody kill that guy?
[375:58.97]Hang out out here, Mirias.
[376:19.00]And need more... Alright, I'm kind of... What do I have?
[376:21.06]I've got 14,000 ore.
[376:28.70]Alright, I need like 300.
[376:29.52]I hope this is worth it.
[376:30.28]619.
[376:36.76]I got another town coming in, though.
[376:43.07]Missed a wink?
[376:56.28]I gotta get rid of these trees.
[376:58.78]We gotta build houses up here.
[376:59.96]Alright, I need another wall.
[377:02.20]Wall.
[377:04.75]Wall.
[377:08.43]Quickly before they get here.
[377:21.64]It's alright.
[377:22.78]It'll be up when they... They did not.
[377:23.90]What do you got?
[377:24.89]How much?
[377:25.31]What do you got for food?
[377:26.55]10,000.
[377:26.57]102,000 food.
[377:26.71]Murius, where are you going?
[377:27.75]What's he up to?
[377:51.75]What is he up to?
[377:52.55]Mirrius, get back here!
[377:53.63]He's drunk.
[377:58.09]Alright, just stay here for now.
[378:03.55]Jesus!
[378:07.04]Alright, we gotta get this built.
[378:17.69]I want this up.
[378:19.59]Immediately.
[378:25.43]Get this built.
[378:26.59]I want it built immediately.
[378:28.47]I got this one.
[378:31.79]Murius, you know what to do.
[378:48.62]Keep building.
[378:50.00]Keep building.
[379:02.63]Build.
[379:07.69]Build it.
[379:14.56]Now we need houses.
[379:17.68]Murius, you go build this.
[379:20.98]Go take care of this.
[379:38.84]Okay.
[379:41.88]Yes, Mirias.
[379:45.24]Make it.
[379:45.70]What do I need?
[379:46.12]Or needed.
[379:46.96]259?
[379:46.98]I got that.
[379:47.28]I got that.
[379:47.86]See?
[380:00.22]Build it.
[380:03.54]Here we go.
[380:12.41]Good?
[380:14.09]Yeah.
[380:36.27]Uh-oh.
[381:11.29]He's trapped on the other side.
[381:32.80]No, but is this big enough to...
[381:36.97]Where's the... Josh, where's the door?
[381:41.43]What's Josh?
[381:42.29]Where's the door?
[381:43.03]Just build this.
[381:52.59]I might be able to do it from here.
[382:00.56]It's right there.
[382:01.28]Drake and Josh.
[382:09.47]When this is built up, I can do that, right?
[382:14.15]Josh, where is the door?
[382:18.71]I've never even seen that episode.
[382:20.56]I know what happens in that episode.
[382:23.10]You know what I'm saying?
[382:23.72]I don't even know what you're talking about.
[382:26.62]But God, I do.
[382:27.46]I know what you mean.
[382:29.04]You get stuck.
[382:31.32]They make a plan to build something.
[382:33.36]I already know what it is.
[382:42.83]How do I even build this fucking thing?
[382:44.53]God!
[382:49.18]Just watch that clip.
[382:53.30]What is it called?
[382:53.80]Like, Drake and Josh?
[382:54.78]Like, a stuck in... Drake and Josh.
[382:56.93]Drake and Josh.
[382:58.87]Stuck.
[382:59.55]Door.
[383:05.03]Where's the door?
[383:07.11]What?
[383:27.05]What?
[383:28.19]Where's the door hole?
[383:30.99]It goes right there.
[383:31.87]See, I drew it with a magic marker.
[383:35.77]You were supposed to cut it out with the power saw.
[383:38.05]Dude, I'm gonna.
[383:39.07]Oh, really?
[383:39.61]Yes.
[383:40.95]So go get the power saw.
[383:42.29]Okay, I will.
[383:52.46]I see the problem.
[383:53.48]Oh, do ya?
[384:03.51]Classic.
[384:04.11]Classic scene.
[384:04.77]I was going to say, is it a treehouse?
[384:08.45]It's a treehouse, right?
[384:09.46]This shit don't fit in here.
[384:15.22]He's never coming back.
[384:16.54]There's no way.
[384:17.16]I fucked it all up.
[384:17.94]Whatever.
[384:19.10]I'm going to destroy it.
[384:29.40]God damn it.
[384:30.46]God damn it.
[384:31.32]God damn it.
[384:32.12]God damn it.
[384:38.04]That was like 500 ore too.
[384:40.36]If it comes down to... If it comes down to I need 500 ore to beat this level... You know where I'm going to be screaming.
[384:48.56]You know I'm going to be screaming here.
[384:50.57]Okay.
[384:51.11]Do it again.
[385:15.02]Is that not big enough?
[385:19.48]Yes, it is.
[385:21.24]It's big enough.
[385:21.64]It's big enough.
[385:22.02]It's big enough.
[385:22.36]It's big enough.
[385:26.93]We're good.
[385:41.13]Link?
[385:46.33]Descending everybody.
[385:48.72]Pull back, pull back, pull back, pull back.
[385:51.96]Oh, he can't.
[385:56.52]He has to fight for his life out here.
[386:06.73]Build it.
[386:10.90]Lightning.
[386:17.34]He was so concerned about that guy.
[386:21.48]Heal.
[386:22.16]Nice.
[386:25.12]Where's he going?
[386:27.95]Stop, stop, stop.
[386:29.47]Stop going so far.
[386:32.85]A man has fallen into the river.
[386:35.37]Oh no.
[386:36.55]Let go.
[386:38.25]Extravaganza.
[386:40.68]This is still just feeding people down here.
[386:42.02]Alright, hurry up and get this thing built so he can leave.
[386:48.34]Alright, I need some more impressive shit.
[386:53.22]We need houses.
[386:55.28]We need nice houses.
[386:56.36]Good houses.
[386:57.42]Cool houses.
[386:59.30]Impressiveness.
[386:59.98]We need impressive houses.
[387:02.56]Like... A mansion, for instance.
[387:06.20]240 impressiveness.
[387:08.24]A manor.
[387:09.54]No, just regular houses.
[387:12.70]No.
[387:14.98]Too much ore.
[387:23.08]Regular house.
[387:24.24]We will avenge your death, honorable warriors.
[387:45.88]This is impressive.
[387:46.80]Me even putting these here is impressive.
[387:50.78]Ain't it?
[387:51.02]He's still going.
[388:05.59]Get the wall built so he can be done.
[388:10.44]He's on a rampage.
[388:13.21]He can't be stopped.
[388:16.05]Although... I want that tiger to come down and I want to throw a rock and hit him in the face and insta-kill him.
[388:36.50]I want him to be running down and I want him to throw the rock and just...
[388:40.92]He's dead.
[388:41.72]Alright, you need to eat some shit.
[388:44.04]You're gonna eat some people.
[388:44.66]Why do I hear a fire?
[388:48.56]Okay, he's good.
[389:11.73]Alright, this is almost done.
[389:14.26]Help them build, if you could.
[389:15.54]I need a... Can you pick this up?
[389:24.29]Is it big enough rock to do damage to a tiger's head and brain?
[389:28.23]What do you think?
[389:42.66]Minus 87?
[389:43.66]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[389:54.75]Stop building these.
[389:55.41]Stop building these.
[389:56.11]Enough.
[389:56.41]No, no, no, no, no.
[389:58.05]Oh, my God.
[389:58.89]Oh, my God.
[389:59.69]Oh, my God.
[390:07.04]It's alright.
[390:16.65]584 and I get the next village.
[390:21.65]What?
[390:22.91]Build villas.
[390:25.35]Weren't those villas?
[390:30.13]Those weren't villas.
[390:30.97]40 to 80.
[390:35.65]Is that 40 minus 89?
[390:58.48]It's gotta be something nicer.
[391:00.17]It's gotta be like mansions.
[391:04.17]Or manors, right?
[391:05.01]120 minus 86.
[391:08.35]Let's build a meadow.
[391:13.43]I got a meadow right here.
[391:14.25]This is 700.
[391:33.54]Rest home.
[391:36.04]It's 500.
[391:46.14]What's going- Murius, what are you staring at?
[391:49.01]Why is he getting- Like, what are you doing?
[391:52.49]Fight back!
[391:53.17]Fight back!
[391:53.89]Fight back!
[391:54.69]Why does he have a stomach ache?
[391:58.11]Free will!
[392:02.19]Fight!
[392:05.28]Watch out for the workers!
[392:12.09]Stay connected to this rock.
[392:18.47]Build that thing.
[392:21.29]Build this.
[392:24.43]Wait a minute.
[392:25.97]Wait a minute.
[392:27.45]Wait a minute.
[392:27.86]Wait a minute.
[392:28.58]Break this.
[392:29.12]We gotta break this.
[392:52.33]I hit it too!
[392:53.55]I fucking smashed it!
[393:04.58]He's got to throw it.
[393:05.42]He's got to do something.
[393:14.21]So what's going on over here?
[393:18.15]What's going on over here?
[393:28.09]Oh, this motherfucker.
[393:30.07]This motherfucker.
[393:30.99]I need rock.
[393:31.95]Murius.
[393:34.07]Come here.
[393:35.49]I got something for you.
[393:37.45]Murius.
[393:40.10]Take this rock.
[393:43.92]Take the rock.
[393:47.88]And I want you to throw this rock over here.
[393:54.38]Throw it over there.
[393:55.40]Pick up the rock.
[393:59.57]Throw the rock over there.
[394:06.19]Go get it.
[394:18.66]You'll throw trees, but you won't throw a rock.
[394:23.65]Fine, just get over here.
[394:25.73]I need you to stay leashed over here so you don't die.
[394:31.87]Okay, just... Why did it bounce?
[394:47.17]Why did this shit just bounce?
[395:02.34]Direct hit.
[395:04.22]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[395:18.92]Got it.
[395:20.82]What the fuck?
[395:24.93]Thank god.
[395:26.05]It's dead.
[395:26.55]Alright.
[395:37.90]Build.
[395:52.65]Okay.
[395:53.55]They just continue to feed troops.
[395:57.55]I am so fucked.
[395:58.67]Alright, I need to start building something now.
[396:01.82]34,000.
[396:03.66]Impressiveness.
[396:05.36]180 ore.
[396:07.06]Impressive.
[396:07.64]Something impressive.
[396:08.36]200 ore.
[396:10.82]A lamp.
[396:13.62]Not that impressive.
[396:14.58]A voodoo doll.
[396:15.22]Not that impressive.
[396:20.12]Hey, what are you doing?
[396:23.47]Hey!
[396:25.43]What's the matter?
[396:25.85]I don't think he was trying to get out.
[396:30.11]You want to get out?
[396:31.69]Want to get out?
[396:34.57]Want to go?
[396:34.92]No, I think he wants to go out.
[396:37.24]Alright, I'll be right back.
[396:37.96]I'm going to take auto out.
[405:02.15]Okay.
[405:04.60]I am back.
[405:06.26]I'm ready to finish this.
[405:07.52]I need a little bit more tribute.
[405:14.96]And we need to build this fucking wall.
[405:20.35]We good?
[405:22.59]Save it, because I haven't done that in a long time.
[405:24.61]Sorry, Otto had to go poop.
[405:33.34]He's gotten even fatter.
[405:43.07]I want his tiger to come down here.
[405:45.51]Don't you?
[405:48.19]I want the tiger to come down.
[405:49.27]I want to fight the tiger.
[405:50.43]Their beast seems to be aware of the teachings of war.
[406:01.78]How can this be?
[406:04.36]Alright, are they actually... Why do I feel like no one's doing anything here?
[406:10.00]There's been no progress on this wall.
[406:12.84]They've made a skeleton.
[406:16.08]Ore?
[406:16.24]Was it because there's no ore over here?
[406:25.65]Big bits?
[406:26.13]Hold on, I'll get to it in one second.
[406:29.65]Like, what's the problem?
[406:32.33]Did somebody do this?
[406:35.27]Somebody build the fucking wall!
[406:38.71]Anyways, carry... Uh, carry USA way.
[406:45.10]Carry USA way.
[406:46.84]Thank you for... The... It's carry us away.
[406:50.18]Yep.
[406:50.66]Okay, I'm just coming to that realization right now.
[406:53.76]Uh, it's not carry USA way.
[406:58.78]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[407:05.36]$50.
[407:05.40]A lot of $50 drops tonight, which is fucking crazy.
[407:09.35]Me too.
[407:09.53]Heard it's fucking fantastic.
[407:30.79]Never... Just finished the wall.
[407:34.89]Everyone's fucking 80 years old.
[407:41.86]Why are you all so old?
[407:48.24]Hold on.
[407:49.74]I got distracted.
[407:52.84]That's why it's not getting built.
[407:54.06]Because everyone working on it is fucking 100.
[407:58.48]Super Mario Sunshine is my favorite Mario game.
[408:01.40]Any chance you'd get Super Smash Bros.
[408:02.78]Melee?
[408:03.56]Probably not.
[408:07.48]I didn't play Ultimate.
[408:08.74]I didn't play Brawl.
[408:11.94]I can't do it anymore.
[408:13.04]I can't play those games anymore.
[408:16.26]Well, that's one way to clean up.
[408:23.20]Fighting games for me are... I've become so bad at them.
[408:28.25]And I don't play enough to... It's just, it's not good.
[408:32.71]It's an embarrassment when I play.
[408:36.15]I still have trouble doing regular smashes and stuff.
[408:42.20]Anyways, I want to say, love you, dude.
[408:44.00]Love you, man.
[408:44.68]I honestly see you like the older brother I never had.
[408:47.52]Love you too, chat.
[408:50.68]Hey, look at how much they like you too.
[408:53.43]Come on.
[408:55.01]You're a Fortnite streamer?
[408:56.11]Come on.
[408:59.14]Thank you for the huge amount of money.
[409:01.24]And the GameCube streams should be pretty fun.
[409:03.78]I'm looking forward to it.
[409:06.52]Especially Chibi-Robo.
[409:09.80]You finally did it.
[409:10.70]Nice work.
[409:12.76]Chibi-Robo, Gachi Force.
[409:15.24]Those are the two that I'm most looking forward to.
[409:16.74]Can we get this fixed?
[409:23.94]Alright, can you please come through the door?
[409:28.26]Yeah, a GameCube is one of those systems.
[409:33.19]Murius, are you fucking kidding me?
[409:41.41]Dude.
[409:51.12]Get it built, quick.
[409:53.74]Why is he so itchy?
[409:57.23]I'm going to poo on their defenses.
[410:02.63]Why is he so itchy?
[410:07.13]He's so- he's got like fleas.
[410:20.56]Build!
[410:23.90]He's allergic to doing work.
[410:32.59]What do you want to do, Murius?
[410:35.35]What do you want to do?
[410:48.06]I don't understand what's going on with him.
[410:50.46]Is there a vet?
[410:53.30]Where's the vet?
[411:05.49]holy shit what the fuck was that that was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life it's a solution it's a solution
[411:32.48]He's like, I don't have time for this shit.

[411:36.04]I blocked it, see?
[411:37.90]Oh, he's so fucking funny.
[411:44.87]That's so fucking ridiculous.
[411:47.35]I'm trying to wash him.
[411:55.43]Murius, you don't get it.
[411:56.79]That's not how you put a wall up.
[412:03.87]uh I I gotta be careful this is hurting he has hives it's because he ate I'm just gonna let him do his thing
[412:40.91]There are bugs on him.
[412:49.46]Give him a snack.
[412:52.72]I need to get him out of the way.

[416:39.89]There's soil on the ground.
[416:41.05]It's like, what the fuck is going on in here?
[416:43.21]And it's like, well, we have this parenting that we do with little Timmy.

[416:55.10]And Timmy, like, walks out.
[416:56.12]He's got, like, four pairs of socks on.
[416:58.52]He's got, like, his dad's boots on.
[417:00.24]He's got two different hats on.

[418:36.57]Hold on.
[418:42.87]Kim has a question.
[418:43.63]I'm just responding.
[418:46.21]Okay.
[418:47.60]So, we need influence.
[418:49.26]Did he just do a somersault into the building and smash it?
[419:11.17]Okay.
[419:12.71]I'm all fucked up right now.
[419:14.27]Let's put some food.
[419:16.76]Impressive shit.
[419:18.80]Let's get some food built up.
[419:20.53]That's what I want.
[419:21.23]Oh my god.
[419:41.28]I still have some ore, so that's good.
[419:42.88]Alright, that's not bad.
[419:47.18]Thank you, Murius.
[419:49.06]Appreciate it.
[419:50.90]We still have a good stronghold here.
[419:54.65]How many more do I need?
[419:55.93]What do I need for Impressive?
[420:02.93]Only 268.
[420:04.05]I take another town.
[420:05.99]Which is as simple as putting up a couple of...
[420:10.05]What should I do?
[420:10.47]Houses?
[420:10.97]Homes?
[420:11.63]What do I need, though?
[420:12.59]Probably another storefront with a farm over here.
[420:14.95]Farm right here.
[420:19.49]Storefront with trees.
[420:26.49]Do it with trees.
[420:30.86]I mean... Okay.
[420:35.66]I mean, if you can't beat them, join them, right?
[420:45.20]You can't beat him, Jonah.
[421:15.17]Who am I kidding?
[421:15.91]He's just gonna pull these up.
[421:22.90]At least he gave me plenty to choose from.
[421:32.74]That's not it?
[421:34.38]Have we not gotten another town?
[421:37.90]The northern outpost has fallen.
[421:40.68]They will pay for this.
[421:43.72]Wow, that's a big town to take.
[421:48.96]That's a big town to take.
[421:53.50]I'm gonna get a lot of resources for that one.
[422:08.77]Are you harassing the archers up here?
[422:14.88]Leave them alone.
[422:15.98]They're working.
[422:19.51]Next up on the list is... 4,600.
[422:23.21]I'm going to go out this way.
[422:27.91]Because there's a ton of space out here that I haven't done.
[422:30.11]Like over here.
[422:32.09]So let's build some... What should I do out here?
[422:38.81]Put a rest home out here.
[422:43.56]Oh, this is kind of uninhabitable, isn't it?
[422:48.85]What do you guys got for wood over here?
[422:49.97]Good.
[423:00.30]Next to the bars?
[423:01.12]Yeah, whatever.

[423:07.04]Nice.
[423:16.86]Keep building.
[423:23.68]End this level.
[423:24.30]Kill them all.
[423:26.06]I don't think I'm gonna need to.
[423:29.07]Put another university down here.
[423:39.65]Or... Field?
[423:42.95]Field?
[423:51.06]university I can't believe he's still evil in the pacifist run well it's because like I told you at the end of this whole thing we're gonna see potentially hundreds of kills so I'm not being evil but I am I am
[424:26.49]Bring over, uh, like 5,000.

[426:19.61]Okay.
[426:33.50]It's a god game.
[426:34.20]Yeah, it's a game where you play as a god.
[426:36.46]Your goal is to influence people around you or kill them and take over their cities.
[426:42.35]You also have a companion that does everything that you tell the two, for the most part.
[426:47.89]379.
[426:51.36]That's six.
[426:51.74]Just about 800.
[426:52.10]Let's do more of those.
[427:04.32]Let's put one of those up here.

[427:29.78]I'm going for it.
[427:44.53]406.
[427:44.87]I still need wood on the other one here.
[427:51.62]I gotta remember where these piles are.
[428:05.12]328.
[428:05.21]I gotta be getting close to one of the last towns, right?
[428:07.99]I'm gonna put the next one up here.
[428:12.41]Oh, that's a good spot right there.
[428:13.78]That's a good spot.
[428:15.28]Oh, yeah.
[428:15.66]What do you think about that one?
[428:18.48]Yeah.
[428:18.88]I'm gonna statue mark it.
[428:21.70]400 plus 199 plus 200.
[428:43.14]I'm gonna pick it all up.
[428:44.00]Plus 200!

[428:44.18]Wait, how close are we?
[429:13.97]946.
[429:14.43]And then the last thing is just the last town.
[429:17.95]And then I will just spam columns until I win.
[429:24.78]What does this do for me?
[429:27.60]Put it right next to it.
[429:28.38]Fucking put it right next to it.
[429:29.54]It's another fucking sick number.
[429:31.86]Read this.
[429:32.22]Read this.
[429:32.58]I read it.
[429:32.90]Oh, you got me.
[429:34.74]Oh, you got me.
[429:45.21]Plant Market.

[430:10.96]There's wood under here.
[430:14.57]Yeah.
[430:15.21]Yeah.
[430:15.37]Uh-huh.
[430:15.63]And here comes another one.
[430:16.39]Who's at the door?
[430:17.03]A lot of people.
[430:17.65]Come on in.
[430:18.87]Hello and welcome.
[430:20.57]5,000, 20,000, 20,000.
[430:20.63]It's game over.
[430:45.34]That's actually game over.
[430:48.20]This is where their last town is right here.
[430:49.78]I'm going to take it.
[430:50.90]I'm going to just keep going.
[430:54.76]Close the gate.
[430:56.16]Close, close, close, close, close, close, close the door.
[430:57.82]Close the door.
[430:58.21]Close the door.
[430:58.61]Here it is.
[431:06.73]Thank God I have archers up here.
[431:14.78]Sorry, they don't stand a chance.
[431:24.50]We're good.
[431:26.32]Yeah, what am I concerned about?
[431:27.62]Sirius, just forget it.
[431:29.82]Do whatever the hell you want.
[431:33.52]Oh, that's an entire army coming.
[431:36.86]Murius, get... No, no, no, Murius, get over here.
[431:39.20]We got a fucking fun thing going on.
[431:41.98]We got rocks to throw.
[431:45.83]Furious, get over here.
[431:46.91]I'm telling you, there's fucking tons of people throwing rocks at us.
[432:02.34]Ready to go.
[432:27.84]Nice wall, Mirrius.
[432:33.51]Not gonna get angry.
[432:45.43]How many can fit?
[432:49.67]Can all of them get on here?
[432:52.28]Okay, there's three people in here.
[432:54.36]Are they all just sitting up here?
[432:57.33]Um... Okay.
[433:15.52]It just renders three?
[433:16.74]Oh, okay.
[433:18.18]Uh, Mirrius, I need you over here.
[433:22.06]We also have... We have another... They're coming with everything.
[433:26.95]We have another migration coming.
[433:28.65]But it's time just... I'm going to win by the love of the people.
[433:37.59]Marius is so strong.
[433:39.33]I want Marius to one-on-one fight that motherfucker.
[433:41.69]You know what I mean?
[433:52.29]Hang out in here, Murius, just for now.
[433:54.81]Stay leashed.
[433:56.71]Where is this creature?
[433:57.47]Because once this goes... Oh, boy.
[434:01.87]Oh, boy.
[434:02.37]Okay, we need to fix this, don't we?
[434:16.06]They're coming in.
[434:19.54]Why'd you do that?
[434:27.99]Fine, eat him.
[434:33.78]Is it a hurricane?
[434:37.38]No.
[434:45.36]We need rocks.
[434:45.96]Mirrius, find me a rock.
[434:47.36]Mirrius.
[434:49.12]Take this.
[434:50.40]Check this out.
[434:54.00]I want to bring as many rocks as I can over here.
[434:55.74]How do you break up rocks?
[435:00.93]Like, can I break this up?
[435:17.46]Double tap?
[435:17.94]Yeah.
[435:18.25]Tap tap.
[435:18.69]Tap tap.
[435:19.33]Tap tap.
[435:19.79]Tap tap.
[435:20.35]No, it's not doing anything.
[435:21.27]Against a wall?
[435:22.27]I'm not gonna do this against the wall.
[435:47.26]I think that actually fixed it, if I'm going to be honest with you.
[435:50.74]I don't think they can get through this.
[435:54.75]Pretty sure that actually makes it better.
[436:01.25]Alright, I need more impressiveness.
[436:05.67]A glorious impressiveness.
[436:08.27]Okay, what do we need to do down here?
[436:09.87]I need a bunch of shit.
[436:15.00]Do I just start spamming columns and just call it a night?
[436:17.50]What do you think?
[436:40.95]Get in there.
[436:53.47]Okay, we need stone.
[436:55.77]Give me some stone, please.
[436:57.45]I want to have some fun with that tree.
[437:03.88]328.
[437:04.58]So really, it's just a... It's a race right now to try to get more influence than I... I need 7,000 influence and I win.
[437:12.92]That's like four universities.
[437:32.76]I'm gonna do that temple.
[437:35.10]I'm doing a temple right here.
[437:35.96]Fuck it.
[437:47.28]Or a creature den?
[437:48.20]I think I'm gonna do a creature den.
[437:54.65]So he has a place to sit right here.
[437:57.13]So he can rest.
[437:59.91]Yeah, that's the play.
[438:00.63]That's the play.
[438:01.03]I'm gonna put one right in here.
[438:06.98]Right there, perfect.
[438:10.67]Look, there's trees around to help me do this.
[438:14.35]I need to go get wood.
[438:38.88]Build up.
[438:41.34]336, not that much, but that's not... I didn't do it for the money.
[438:48.37]Okay.
[439:02.59]Now, you... I need you to rest up, because... We got quite a big day tomorrow, as you see.
[439:08.56]There's dozens of people at that wall.
[439:12.40]I'm gonna be torturing them with, um... Explosives, as you know.
[439:16.37]We got a big day tomorrow.
[439:35.17]Pot market.
[439:35.69]I want a pot market in here.
[439:36.69]Another graveyard probably, huh?
[439:45.74]Get the graveyard away from everybody?
[439:46.98]No, they want it.
[439:53.82]They like it.
[439:54.65]They don't hate this.
[439:57.27]They don't hate this.
[439:58.13]Yeah, sure.
[439:58.59]Let's go.
[439:58.95]Right here.
[440:10.29]I don't hate you, Jeremy.
[440:14.21]Where the fuck are the Drew crews tonight?
[440:16.46]Ah, they couldn't show up.
[440:19.60]Sorry.
[440:20.04]I tried to tell you.
[440:21.70]I thought you saw.
[440:22.52]This will give us, like, 600?
[440:35.70]Yep.
[440:40.90]Alright, there's got to be a final battle before I take all of his people from him, right?
[440:44.20]These guys aren't going to get slaughtered, are they?
[440:46.60]Oh, yo.
[440:50.92]Looks like you've grown up a little.
[440:52.96]Looks like you've grown up a little.
[440:54.22]Isn't that just interesting?
[440:57.08]Isn't that interesting?
[441:06.86]Hmm.
[441:08.94]Here he is.
[441:11.95]How you feel?
[441:18.34]Okay, go have some fun.
[441:20.86]They're preparing for a final battle.
[441:25.47]This is final battle to me.
[441:26.91]It's about four or five hundred people.
[441:29.93]But what they don't realize is every single one of them is going to die in one hit.
[441:36.34]I'm gonna roll a fireball across everybody and... I'm surprised I haven't done it yet.
[441:40.56]You know, I'm just kind of seeing if they put enough... how many people they put here.
[441:43.48]Here comes Helm's Deep.
[441:48.54]I gotta be careful opening this door.
[442:01.23]What's the final number I need?
[442:02.61]6... 47...
[442:08.92]Make sure we get plenty of rocks over here.
[442:15.10]Okay, we're good.
[442:20.26]Why are there animals in here?
[442:21.40]Here we go.
[442:26.87]20,000, 15,000 more favor.
[442:27.63]Alright, get over it.
[442:49.35]The door doesn't work I'm ready for this Okay, there we go
[443:11.82]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[443:15.41]Stay here.
[443:17.61]Stay leashed to this fucking rock.
[443:21.03]Oh, the tiger.
[443:22.15]Oh, what?
[443:22.71]I'm sorry.
[443:23.37]The tiger wants to come in?
[443:25.30]Close the door, close the door, close the door, close the door.
[443:27.80]Where's that fucking tiger?
[443:39.25]Oh, sneaky, huh?
[443:41.59]Sneaky.
[443:42.76]Why don't you come over and say it to my face?
[443:45.92]I'll let you in.
[443:46.62]One-on-one.
[443:47.44]Nobody will hit you.
[443:48.14]Nobody will shoot you.
[443:48.76]I promise.
[443:49.70]One-on-one.
[443:50.10]Throw it.
[444:13.35]Damn it!
[444:13.77]Damn it.
[444:14.84]I thought he was gonna whip it at his head.
[444:20.30]The gate is closed!
[444:21.30]Come on, tiger!
[444:52.77]No, no, no!
[444:53.45]No, no!
[444:53.81]Go back!
[444:55.09]Oh shit!
[444:56.47]Oh no!
[445:03.14]Close to get clo-
[445:21.23]Come on Muris, kick his ass.
[445:24.05]Come on, come on, daddies.
[445:26.81]Daddy will help you, daddy will help.
[445:35.44]Oh my god, I just killed everyone.
[445:44.52]Watch your back, watch the backside.
[445:51.50]Get on top of him!
[445:59.60]Kill him!
[446:03.19]Is the door open?
[446:23.22]Too far too far back up Too far
[446:49.23]Holy shit, man.
[446:50.39]That like, huge butt drop on his face.
[446:55.77]That was insane.
[446:59.09]Wow.
[447:00.22]What a finish.
[447:01.90]What a finish.
[447:07.18]That's two-handed clap right there.
[447:17.61]Okay, we had our fun.
[447:19.95]I'll get the fuck out of my land.
[447:27.09]Yeah, it's been fun.
[447:36.10]How's that one going to land?
[447:37.96]Oh, in the back fleet.
[447:45.48]Oh.
[447:58.43]That's a bad one that's going right in the middle oh Oh, that's rough Wait I'm supposed to be the good guy
[448:28.60]Uh, right.
[448:29.14]I'm supposed to be the good guy.
[448:31.00]How many points do I need?
[448:35.73]I absolutely clowned on that tiger, though.
[448:37.65]Let me be honest.
[448:40.07]Oh, now I need 90.
[448:41.43]Oh, no.
[448:42.21]Now I gotta take it by force because of that.
[448:53.74]Well...
[448:56.71]Y'know?
[448:59.35]Sometimes.
[449:02.45]Are you low- does save scum that?
[449:14.17]Which one was it?
[449:14.67]852, 850, 430, 902.
[449:15.15]Wait.
[449:15.43]It's not even 902 right now, it's 858 Pacific.
[449:27.54]What?
[449:27.72]852 was this one, right?
[449:41.99]Yeah, it was this one right here.
[449:43.65]Game001.
[449:44.39]Wait a wink.
[449:45.54]I'll get it right here.
[449:50.00]Some primer shit.
[449:54.73]Save before I load.
[449:56.75]That's not a bad idea, just in case something horrible happens.
[449:59.11]We're going to call this one, um... Post-battle.
[450:13.32]Okay.
[450:15.04]Now let's load game001.
[450:16.12]Yeah, because I'm playing this not military, so...
[450:25.85]That's true.
[450:26.25]I did kind of fuck it up.
[450:30.27]Why are they charging?
[450:32.90]Alright, so... We're friendly.
[450:38.00]We're friendly.
[450:41.30]Close the inner gate.
[450:46.35]We're fine.
[450:47.37]So I just need like 4,000 more favor.
[450:48.33]4,900.
[450:48.37]That's easy.
[450:48.73]That's easy.
[450:59.97]Whatever.
[451:00.58]You have your fun.
[451:03.06]Right when I have... I want to kick his ass again.
[451:15.80]Alright, let's do the favorite route.
[451:17.78]Let's do the tribute route.
[451:19.36]Let's just build some more shit over here.
[451:20.58]I have plenty of resources now.
[451:21.92]I have tens of thousands of everything.
[451:25.44]Let's do... What's the most impressive thing that I can build?
[451:28.38]What is the most impressive thing?
[451:29.76]Pound for pound.
[451:32.22]Universities.
[451:32.66]It has to be.
[451:52.31]I'm just... I have so many schools.
[451:57.84]Schools are just everywhere.
[451:59.04]This is the most educated group.
[452:03.65]Look, Murius even gets his own school.
[452:20.26]Oh, there's already... He already has his own school.
[452:26.34]Okay.
[452:26.84]Let's see how far this gets us.
[452:28.44]Let's do war first.
[452:30.06]I forget where I put that.
[452:59.98]Okay.
[453:02.06]We now need to just simply put this back, get some wood.
[453:06.46]What's that?
[453:11.10]What's that lightning shit?
[453:16.75]I need... I'm gonna need, like, 10, 20,000.
[453:18.15]Fine.
[453:18.31]Okay.
[453:30.22]I'm looking forward to watching the VOD later.
[453:31.64]Hopefully there are no dumbass winks.
[453:34.62]Uh, there aren't.
[453:36.56]I got rid of those.
[453:38.12]If you see one, it's probably like a glitch on your computer.
[453:40.68]I'd probably get a new computer if you see one.
[453:42.06]Alright, that was a lot.
[453:57.02]More colleges.
[454:02.09]Alright, I'm just... I just so... I want to roll a boulder out the window.
[454:09.71]2,600.
[454:09.75]That's five, six more colleges?
[454:11.86]Okay, you got it.
[454:17.72]I got no more room for these colleges.
[454:38.46]Beach College?
[454:42.84]Build a wonder?
[454:43.53]I don't have the... I don't have the tribute to be able to research it.
[454:46.45]Alright, let's get a bunch of wood.
[454:55.19]Start the building process and win the game.
[454:56.55]Guys, my next class is on campus 36 and it's 247 miles away.
[455:02.40]Sorry to hear that.
[455:16.39]This would be the first time ever, I think, I've ever completed a video game mission without, like, cheese ball throwing rocks over a wall.
[455:27.40]Right?
[455:27.84]This is a first for me.
[455:30.04]This is pretty remarkable, actually.
[455:31.24]Alright, there's one, two, three, four.
[455:43.27]There's another one over here, right?
[455:45.79]Got these ones.
[455:50.35]Okay, I'm running out of room for colleges, so hopefully we're almost done.
[455:56.36]Link redeemed?
[456:05.24]Alright, I'm getting close to having not enough to do this.
[456:08.30]I went...
[456:16.89]I would not have believed these Greeks could be so strong.
[456:21.93]Brother, go through the portal to our homeland.
[456:25.73]Prepare it for the Greek arrival.
[456:28.44]They will surely go there next.
[456:32.78]At our capital, they will face the two sides of the Japanese.
[456:37.40]Even with a god, they will not succeed.
[456:47.23]This is an enemy worthy of respect, but we shall be stronger when we next meet.
[456:53.62]The war is not over yet.
[456:56.52]Where's Waldo?
[456:58.64]And what is Waldo doing?
[457:09.69]Where's Waldo?
[457:10.43]What is Waldo doing?
[457:20.49]Playing with trees.
[457:21.69]Yes, that's correct.
[457:25.49]You got it.
[457:27.79]Um, so let's save it.
[457:28.81]I just beat this level.
[457:29.71]I'm going to save the game right here.
[457:31.11]And then I'm going to go slaughter everybody.
[457:37.22]And then we'll load it correctly.
[457:39.68]And we'll leave the mission.
[457:40.68]You know what?
[457:40.96]Just open the gate.
[457:42.36]Open the gate.
[457:43.08]Let him in.
[457:47.00]Hey.
[457:48.73]Rematch.
[457:50.58]This time, no... Wait a minute.
[458:03.49]No interference.
[458:04.13]Round two.
[458:05.94]Entertainment only.
[458:29.47]That's not entertainment.
[458:30.45]That's not entertaining.
[458:32.05]Furious.
[458:34.30]Alright, fine.
[458:35.02]Switch to fucking soldier.
[458:37.64]Get angry.
[458:38.20]I need to poo.
[459:11.90]Big right uppercut.
[459:18.94]I hope he beats him, and I hope he shits on him.
[459:23.10]Oh, he missed the huge uppercut.
[459:24.42]Come on, you had it.
[459:30.16]Come on, Murius.
[459:32.08]You're getting caught in these random... Oh, that was a big miss.
[459:38.34]There it is.
[459:39.38]Finish him!
[459:40.28]Finish him!
[459:47.15]Yes!
[459:50.19]Big finish!
[459:52.34]Did you hear the shits?
[460:26.59]He said, can I get a little privacy behind the tree?
[461:03.64]Everything is a tree.
[461:05.50]Everything has to be used as a tree.
[461:08.34]Can you get a little... Fine, I'll give you some privacy.
[461:10.06]Look.
[461:52.50]Okay.
[461:54.14]You had your fun.
[461:57.08]Good work.
[461:59.92]How do we roll him into the water?
[462:22.18]Make it so he can't get up.
[462:30.66]I'm a bit hungry.
[463:08.80]That was like a yeah!
[463:14.66]Alright, let's end it.
[463:20.41]Where's the scroll?
[463:21.01]Wait!
[463:22.29]There's another scroll over here.
[463:23.27]I didn't even see it.
[463:24.76]What is this?
[463:26.90]Free favor.
[463:29.98]Link, hold on, I'll look at it in a second.
[463:31.70]Today, we are on the trail of the ruins of Zantora.
[463:36.29]My research has led me to believe the tomb is on this very island.
[463:41.55]There is an ancient rune hidden round the camp somewhere.
[463:46.19]It will direct us to where the mystical building is hidden.
[463:50.33]Let's begin our expedition.
[463:53.30]I believe the first of the runes we seek is very near to where we currently stand.
[464:02.64]Let me get this link.
[464:08.07]Hold on.
[464:09.09]This is worth $40,000.
[464:12.15]Hold on.
[464:12.89]There's a link.
[464:13.53]Let me check it out.
[464:26.32]It's perfect.
[464:27.95]It's actually perfect.
[464:53.11]This is great.
[464:56.98]The blur.
[465:00.70]Awesome.
[465:01.20]It looks fucking great.
[465:05.49]Uh, do I even want to do this right now?
[465:06.95]I don't think I want to do this right now.
[465:10.41]So, uh, scrub.
[465:58.67]What do I have to do?
[466:03.65]Scrub.
[466:13.72]No, this is the mission.
[466:15.01]Right here?
[466:32.83]Here it is.
[466:33.61]And look, there is an ancient text.
[466:38.00]I will translate.
[466:39.76]That's what you do?
[466:41.36]It says, at the base of the solitary tree.
[466:47.68]What can it mean?
[466:55.24]At the base of the tree.
[467:25.08]The same person?
[467:25.72]When the sun is sleeping on the solitary rock?
[467:29.57]Hmm, I wonder what that means.
[468:36.48]This is not a rock right here?
[468:51.78]What's the big floating thing?
[468:53.64]I was just over here.
[469:29.24]Where is it?
[469:51.81]Solitary rock?
[469:55.29]Um, yeah, but, I mean, this whole thing is a rock!
[470:00.45]We found it.
[470:08.94]Under the rock?
[470:26.50]On the rock.
[470:30.80]Point to it.
[470:34.38]The whole planet's a rock.
[471:22.96]The rock that you tried to crush the villagers with.
[471:25.92]Yeah, but that rock is gone.
[471:38.97]The rock does not... Where the fuck is it?
[471:41.22]Where is it?
[471:41.92]It's the same area?
[471:43.90]I was just spinning around in circles.
[471:45.00]I don't even know where the hell that is.
[471:50.39]It's right here.
[471:51.31]What the fuck are you talking about?
[471:53.05]What?
[472:05.62]The single rock Over the hill
[472:32.05]On the coast.
[472:33.65]This one right here.
[472:34.56]Is that what this right here?
[472:37.12]I can't move this.
[472:49.07]Okay.
[472:52.02]I thought I was trying to get on a... What?
[472:53.52]I thought I was going to be on the rock.
[472:56.36]What a bad game.
[472:57.96]What a bad game.
[472:58.74]It's not me.
[472:59.22]It's the game that's bad.
[473:00.16]What a bad video game.
[473:01.28]God.
[473:01.68]I'm so annoyed by this video.
[473:04.86]This game is so bad.
[473:22.60]If only it would... It's not me.
[473:25.65]Everything else is fucking dumb.
[473:27.23]Not me.
[473:27.77]Of course not.
[473:38.55]Mad because bad.
[473:39.87]Stop banning that.
[473:41.58]I don't want to see that anymore.
[473:42.44]I don't want to see that again.
[473:44.40]Mad because bad?
[473:45.54]No.
[473:45.84]It's because the game's not very good, actually.
[473:48.82]So, what are you talking about?
[473:54.42]Okay.
[473:54.98]Fun.
[473:55.44]Funny.
[473:56.10]Really funny.
[473:58.08]And mods are doing it too.
[474:00.36]Yeah.
[474:00.88]I'll see you guys in like three weeks.
[474:03.00]I'm not streaming for like another three weeks.
[474:06.60]Yeah.
[474:07.20]No.
[474:07.52]I'll see you guys like in a month.
[474:10.24]You know.
[474:10.74]No.
[474:18.21]Jerma's doing a good job.
[474:19.51]Thanks.
[474:21.87]I never... I appreciate that.
[474:24.57]That means a lot.
[474:25.79]Really?
[474:26.07]Okay.
[474:27.70]Yeah, thank you.
[474:35.56]Is my webcam squished?
[474:38.52]Hold on.
[474:39.40]Something's weird with this webcam today.
[474:46.17]Something's off about it.
[474:47.11]What happened?
[474:48.41]I stretched it.
[474:51.59]Okay, it was just ever so slightly stretched like this.
[474:56.21]It looked... It looked... It looked strange.
[475:05.89]Okay, that was... Something about that was fucking strange.
[475:10.45]Right?
[475:10.91]It was like this.
[475:11.53]Whatever.
[475:28.21]Alright, let's complete this and I'm going to be going to bed.
[475:32.46]Well, not bed, actually.
[475:33.16]I need to get food.
[475:33.66]I need to eat something.
[475:39.92]We'll call it pretty much exactly at 8 hours.
[475:42.89]McDonald's?
[475:43.45]No.
[475:43.83]No McDonald's.
[475:44.55]None of that.
[475:45.65]Alright, I got 40,000 favor, right?
[475:48.95]What?
[475:49.55]Wait, wait, wait.
[475:50.47]What happened here?
[475:53.53]I wasn't paying any, and I mean a single fucking piece of attention.
[475:58.12]There's another one?
[476:05.22]I didn't even hear what they said.
[476:11.63]What was the clue?
[476:15.37]Find the point between tasks passed.
[476:17.79]Hmm, a difficult riddle.
[476:19.83]Point between tasks passed.
[476:36.73]Point between tasks passed.
[476:47.84]Bad on purpose.
[476:48.50]What?
[476:48.74]What's going on?
[476:49.20]What are you talking about?
[476:53.54]Point between tasks passed.
[477:15.46]It's like in here somewhere.
[477:20.18]Point between tasks passed.
[477:21.52]Wouldn't it be in the middle of all these?
[477:36.30]Geomachy.
[477:36.84]He's actually pretending.
[477:38.14]Sad face.
[477:38.72]I don't... I wouldn't even look at anything.
[477:46.48]Oh, is this the middle?
[477:59.33]Didn't I already try this in this clearing?
[478:01.31]I already did it in here.
[478:05.32]But he's actually pretending.
[478:12.18]Just tell me where it is.
[478:13.92]I could give a shit less about what I'm doing right now.
[478:18.67]Triangle.
[478:19.47]What?
[478:25.02]It's the green patch on the hill.
[478:41.73]There's a point between tasks passed.
[478:44.89]That doesn't help me.
[479:15.70]The middle of a triangle.
[479:21.60]Oh.
[479:24.24]Turn on click maps?
[479:25.30]I can't, because I can't alt-tab the game.
[479:33.70]These are the tasks, right here.
[479:36.90]In the middle point between tasks passed.
[479:40.28]Wouldn't that be, like, right here?
[479:44.46]Or like here?
[479:45.24]I don't understand.
[479:46.22]I'm just as confused as he is.
[480:00.36]That's the logic, I think.
[480:01.58]Well, he can't be serious.
[480:05.99]No, you're not serious because you don't know where the fuck it is either.
[480:11.79]So where is it?
[480:19.91]on the patch.
[480:46.35]Huge rocks.
[480:48.03]Wow.
[480:58.57]I did it here like fucking ten times.
[481:19.50]Why won't it do it?
[481:37.72]I did it here already a bunch of times.
[481:41.08]It shows me the way to the ruin.
[481:43.06]Follow me.
[481:44.95]I actually did it there at least three or four times.
[481:49.91]Wow.
[481:55.03]Here we are.
[481:56.49]The ruins must be beneath these huge rocks.
[482:00.85]We would need the strength of the gods to move these.
[482:04.75]We'll never get to examine
[482:06.71]Half of you motherfuckers wanted me to go up to the mountain, alright?
[482:09.93]So... Give it a rest.
[482:11.37]Okay, why do you...
[482:45.16]Alright, go in!
[482:52.14]I cleared it for you, go take a look!
[483:07.97]Smooth them.
[483:10.97]Throw the rocks into the water?
[483:20.35]What the fuck?
[483:21.07]You can't just walk in here?
[483:22.47]There it is.
[483:25.79]We couldn't see it before.
[483:29.06]Thanks God he's full of rocks two miles away in the water.
[483:32.38]Critics are saying it's the funniest movie of the year.
[483:37.48]Sonic the Hedgehog, rated PG.
[483:55.16]I thought I was getting hacked.
[483:58.42]I thought I was getting hacked, dude.
[483:59.64]What the fuck just happened?
[484:03.17]Like an ad just started playing.
[484:05.37]Fuck, I must have downloaded something weird.
[484:09.17]Holy shit!
[484:13.23]There's too many people.
[484:14.11]We, um... I don't think we can take this many people.
[484:17.93]How many...
[484:29.77]This is like 6 million people.
[484:32.39]It's a thousand people.
[484:34.36]I don't even have a thousand people in my whole town.
[484:36.34]I don't know.
[485:03.85]Alright, there's so many... You look like Nickelodeon Floam, for God's sakes.
[485:10.01]There's so many people there.
[485:19.90]It just looks like Floam.
[485:25.20]It didn't happen.
[485:25.76]You didn't see it.
[485:26.30]Alright, I'm going to bed.
[485:36.23]A guy just went... Only one guy... One person in the crowd just went... Okay, I don't want to see that.
[486:01.49]It's too much.
[486:02.15]It's too much for my brain.
[486:09.65]Let's let them in.
[486:10.53]Let them in.
[486:11.09]Wait a sec.
[486:41.23]Where's the save?
[486:43.45]It's 9.36 p.m.
[486:44.79]right now.
[486:47.53]There it is.
[486:47.95]Okay, we're fine.
[486:50.15]Let them in.
[486:50.67]They can come in.
[486:54.01]Ah, my chest is killing me.
[486:55.51]I've laughed so fucking hard tonight.
[486:57.17]Like, at random shit.
[486:58.73]I haven't laughed super hard at anything.
[487:01.57]But I've just said it's been a constant stream of comedy and humor for me.
[487:05.42]Like, it's been almost seven straight hours of me just laughing.
[487:18.73]Successful penis stream.
[487:23.18]Why did I just read that?
[487:33.58]So many people.
[487:36.49]Let's at least go see the next cutscene.
[487:46.37]Murius, be nice.
[487:54.84]Here he is.
[487:55.40]Be nice.
[487:57.26]He's shaking his head.
[487:58.00]He's like, nah, nah, nah, nah.
[487:59.18]There's too many people.
[488:00.22]We don't have enough food.
[488:09.88]Alright, they're in.
[488:13.20]Let's check out the next area.
[488:14.94]And then I'm going to bed.
[488:15.84]I gotta get out of here.
[488:18.28]And then I've got physical therapy tomorrow, so I'm not going to be live tomorrow.
[488:21.72]Or on Sunday.
[488:22.68]I'll be back on Monday.
[488:28.88]I'll be back, like, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[488:33.13]Something like that.
[488:33.79]But I really wanted to see this part, because...
[488:48.12]this is uh this is important no towns taken by force the whole night well actually that's a lie I beat the last level too nine percent evil I didn't do anything impressiveness yeah happiness was pretty good
[489:12.48]population the highest population was 1234 which is because I got 778 people um what happened here 1100 male population 143 female
[489:40.36]Is that why we're having so many problems?
[489:41.58]Did I just get really bad RNG or something?
[489:46.64]That's weird.
[489:52.35]That's number of enemy soldiers killed 555.
[489:55.07]I wonder how many of those are Murius.
[490:02.43]1758 deaths.
[490:13.44]58 water miracles, 6.
[490:14.40]Only 6 fireballs.
[490:15.62]That's pretty good.
[490:18.96]I did most of the... No, I didn't do any of these.
[490:21.40]I did nut oil.
[490:24.68]Alright, here's the good one.
[490:26.40]70% good.
[490:26.66]70% good.
[490:26.88]He's 12.
[490:27.10]He's 11 feet tall.
[490:28.02]He's now 8,000 pounds.
[490:41.01]He's at 92% muscle, 75% fit, 100 hit points, 146 bowel movements, and he killed 800 people.
[491:10.47]So in the whole land, he was responsible for killing half of every single living person in this whole country over the course of what I assume is like three or four years.
[491:34.80]He killed half the population himself.
[491:42.77]Jesus.
[491:48.76]Good job, my pet.
[491:53.00]Take a look at this next cutscene.
[491:59.00]As we ready ourselves, we will let the Greeks prepare for our storm to come.
[492:06.84]You are right.
[492:08.12]They have divine help.
[492:10.26]But the prophecy says they will rise against those who nearly destroyed them.
[492:16.64]The Aztecs.
[492:19.38]If they can triumph over us, we will have no option but to offer ourselves to their side.
[492:27.38]You speak sense, brother.
[492:29.57]We have both seen what these Greeks can do, but we must make a stand here first.
[492:37.27]This is the tiger that I humiliated like three times.
[492:43.69]But the second brother isn't a city builder.
[492:46.77]He prefers destruction.
[492:48.87]You should beware him.
[492:51.09]He can catch my shiny right behind.
[492:54.60]This level is huge.
[492:55.18]And that's where we're going to close it for tonight.
[492:57.16]I do want to take a look at the map
[493:26.06]This is a big boy.
[493:28.40]Not really, actually.
[493:31.80]It's just two big strongholds.
[493:34.60]Save it here.
[493:35.22]I'm gonna call this one Two Fronts.
[493:36.68]Classic RTS map, yeah.
[493:37.89]And there's one in the middle.
[493:43.35]That's a big point of interest.
[493:57.63]I wish this is the one we just played.
[493:59.53]This one looks fun.
[494:02.03]But that's going to be it for today.
[494:06.24]I will see you guys later.
[494:07.20]See you guys on Monday.
[494:08.82]We are not going to come back to Black and White 2 on Monday.
[494:16.54]We're going to change games.
[494:23.67]Get a good look at Murius.
[494:30.60]Beautiful, beautiful, but still quite itchy, Murius.
[494:38.43]We're going to do, on Monday, Chibi-Robo.
[494:45.52]I have it.
[494:46.16]It's ready to go.
[494:48.42]Should be a lot of fun.
[494:59.99]Pet Murius?
[495:02.73]After Chibi-Robo is done, we will see if I want to come back and finish this, because I believe this... I think there's only one or two maps left in the whole game.
[495:13.15]There's also the expansion, which I do own as well.
[495:22.94]So I'm assuming I could probably do another stream on this and finish the base game at least.
[495:30.85]We'll see.
[495:31.43]I'm not going to be doing that next week, though.
[495:33.51]We're going to have to put the cap on this for a little while.
[495:36.70]But it is available.
[495:38.48]Black and White 2 is now just available.
[495:43.92]And the expansion.
[495:44.58]Expansion's like five big levels?
[495:47.75]Cool.
[495:55.19]Available, in quotes.
[495:58.56]No, but I love this game, so I'm having so much fun.
[496:01.65]It's definitely something I want to play again on stream.
[496:04.69]Pet the cow before I... Okay, I'll pet cow before I turn it off.
[496:09.59]Come here.
[496:09.99]Hey, you.
[496:12.45]Hey, come here.
[496:17.08]You're hiding.
[496:17.96]Watch out.
[496:18.36]Come here.
[496:39.49]Goodbye, Mirias.
[496:40.17]We'll see you again soon.
[496:44.31]And that goes for you guys as well.
[496:46.41]We'll see you again on Monday.
[496:52.22]It is saved there.
[497:02.00]Murius for Rumble.
[497:03.84]Murius for Own TV Show.
[497:14.49]I'll see you guys later.
[497:16.57]I'm gonna get some food.
[497:17.47]I'm hungry.
[497:24.27]Murius replaced Bugleberry.
[497:25.77]Okay.
[497:33.28]Let me just load up the... Make sure I have the bits in the right spot.
[497:37.23]I should.
[497:41.99]I do.
[497:42.47]Okay.
[497:44.05]Let's go back earlier today.
[497:46.99]We had $2.80 from For Real Dough, 280 bits.
[497:49.23]Now that you've been enjoying Black and White, any chance you'll reconsider Dungeon Keeper?
[497:56.48]Maybe, but... I think the reason why I like Black and White so much is because...
[498:04.33]There's so much to look at at any given moment.
[498:07.45]Having the creature just do shit and run around and I can just laugh at the things that the cow is doing takes me away from the actual video game of city building.
[498:18.70]And that's why I can stay interested.
[498:23.31]Dungeon Keeper is... It's an interesting game.
[498:29.08]But I think it's more so I would probably lose interest in it after a stream.
[498:34.81]And that's correct me if I'm wrong, but that's a pretty long experience, isn't it?
[498:43.14]Isn't Dungeon Keeper more than like a 30 plus hour game?
[498:48.78]Potentially.
[498:53.76]Just look at chat instead.
[498:55.92]It is.
[498:56.70]Well, not that long, but it's a bit, yeah.
[499:00.38]And I always have trouble finishing games on stream anyways that... I don't know.
[499:05.74]And look, I'm speaking completely kind of out of my ass here because I've only played Dungeon Keeper for maybe 30 minutes total more than 15 years ago.
[499:19.74]I just don't... It didn't grab me when I was younger.
[499:23.63]This did.
[499:24.09]I remember being 15 years old playing Black and White 1.
[499:27.36]14.
[499:29.70]Something like that.
[499:31.00]Whatever how old I was.
[499:38.12]I also don't like to completely say I'm never going to do something.
[499:41.78]Because sometimes it just happens.
[499:49.02]So, I don't know.
[499:51.68]I'll have to look into it.
[499:54.42]But thank you for the, uh, 280, though.
[500:01.69]Thank you, Raddest Raccoon, for the 250!
[500:04.81]There's gonna be a couple things on the new channel points.
[500:12.49]You'll see.
[500:14.55]You do what you want with your own currency, though.
[500:17.35]Whatever you want to do with it, it's your call, it's your idea.
[500:23.11]I'm gonna be adding other stuff, though.
[500:25.32]That's hopefully interesting.
[500:30.63]Dark Soul, thanks for the $2.50, Dark Soul.
[500:32.45]Hi, I'm here from Goop Gaming.
[500:35.25]Yeah, I said the sea salt thing earlier.
[500:36.63]Whatever I said.
[500:36.97]Thank you, DarkSoulful250.

[501:30.37]Which one it is, you'll have to figure that out.
[501:36.75]Thank you for the $15.
[501:37.31]Getting a little hoarse.
[501:40.59]Anytime I laugh really, really hard over the course of a whole stream, my voice just turns into diarrhea.
[501:51.54]Thank you for the $1500, Bits.
[501:54.98]Internet Jorge, thanks for the 1,500 bits.
[501:57.38]Back-to-back $15.

[501:58.92]It's a lot of money.
[502:00.76]It's a big bit drop.
[502:03.42]What's the funniest movie of the year so far?
[502:09.21]Um... I don't know.
[502:20.39]Uh...
[502:27.61]I want to say onward.
[502:32.09]That was kind of funny.
[502:32.99]It was cute and funny.
[502:34.16]Is that movie out yet?
[502:42.68]Nope.
[502:42.90]It's not even out yet.
[502:52.66]It was out on March 6th.
[502:53.86]Whoops.
[502:55.48]Uh, that looks like the funniest movie to me.
[502:58.36]I'm not gonna let some advertisement tell me what the funniest movie in the world is and the best movie in the world is.
[503:03.52]I'm gonna make my own decision.
[503:05.36]I'm gonna go see Onward when it comes out and see if it's the best movie of the year.
[503:10.33]Hey, Emanuel Depressed, thanks for the 300 bits.
[503:12.21]Hi, Jerma.
[503:12.55]I know you're getting sick of Winx.
[503:14.17]Have you ever thought about replacing them with, uh, Twunks or Twinks?
[503:20.33]I hopefully didn't just say anything bad.
[503:31.31]He did.
[503:32.45]Okay.
[503:34.19]Well, whatever.
[503:35.13]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[503:36.79]Winks will be replaced by something.
[503:38.20]Don't worry.
[503:39.62]Bulbaswag, thanks for the 500 bits.
[503:42.02]Just get a couple clips of you winking and play whenever someone redeems it.
[503:45.64]No one has to know.
[503:46.94]People will know immediately.
[503:49.64]Something that Twitch chat and the internet kind of culture in general can do is sniff out bullshit instantly.
[504:00.21]Instantly.
[504:04.00]It would take one or two times before it was... Cat was out of the bag, you know what I mean?
[504:15.29]Thank you.
[504:15.61]Yeah, I would assume.
[504:18.75]Probably.
[504:28.08]I don't see why not.
[504:29.62]I have to turn my Switch on for some reason.
[504:32.49]It's been just neglected sitting there in the corner, not turned on ever.
[504:37.93]It's kind of turning into the way that my Xbox One was.
[504:41.33]But I haven't really turned on my PS4 either.
[504:42.90]I need a reason to play something.
[504:50.86]We are getting close to the end of the console cycles for at least Xbox and PS4.
[504:59.94]PS5 is coming out this year.
[505:01.20]It's so weird.
[505:03.16]It's so strange that the PS5 is going to come out.
[505:13.66]This year.
[505:14.18]Holiday this year.
[505:15.16]You think they'll delay it?
[505:20.14]been like seven years for this console cycle yeah but for some reason it feels like it hasn't been this has been an incredibly long cycle going into eight years after right it's doesn't feel like it's only been out for like three years four years I feel like it hasn't been out for that long uh subway rat princess thanks for the 300 bits three dollars thank you
[505:49.79]Esquilo, thanks for the $2.50.
[505:51.49]Hey, jerkma.
[505:53.77]985, a sandwich is defined as a carbohydrate product or other containing edible structure of reasonable structural fortitude.
[506:00.77]Utilized as a vehicle for ingredients to reach the mouth with excessive dirtying or greasing of the hands.
[506:06.19]A sandwich must have portability and relative tidiness.
[506:10.29]Its main function is to guide the ingredients to the mouth without the use of utensils.
[506:14.04]Thus, a pizza is a sandwich, a hot dog is a sandwich, and a taco is a sandwich.
[506:19.78]No, they're not.
[506:26.52]Pizza is a pizza.
[506:27.86]It's not a pizza sandwich.
[506:29.19]A hot dog is a hot dog.
[506:30.35]It's in a bun.
[506:32.11]It's not a hot dog sandwich.
[506:33.95]A taco is a taco.
[506:36.43]It's not a taco sandwich.
[506:40.35]And by the way, if you have pizza, it's a pie.
[506:50.56]Then what's an open-faced sandwich?
[506:53.32]A sandwich that's not completed.
[506:54.72]Pizza's not a pie, it's a flatbread.
[507:05.08]We talked about this in the Discord for like 40 minutes.
[507:09.40]No, no, no.
[507:10.36]A sandwich... was created... by... some dude...
[507:19.17]The modern concept of a sandwich using slices of bread as found within the West can arguably trace to 18th century Europe.
[507:29.10]John's sandwich.
[507:38.07]The use of some kind of bread or bread-like substance to lie under and over some other food or used to scoop up and enclose or wrap some other type of food.
[507:49.08]So we're talking about a complete closure here, as a sandwich.
[507:52.38]Hot dog does not have a complete closure.
[507:55.34]Pizza does not have complete closure.
[507:57.38]Taco does not have complete closure.
[508:01.86]A sandwich is a complete closure.
[508:06.10]And you could also say, well, hold on a second, what about a sub?
[508:08.42]What about a sub sandwich?
[508:10.68]What about a sub?
[508:12.28]Well, I mean, technically, I mean, it's a hoagie, right?
[508:21.14]What about a wrap?
[508:21.72]That's an enclosure.
[508:22.66]Completely enclosed.
[508:27.41]Burritos are sandwiches.
[508:30.61]Yeah.
[508:32.03]You have complete enclosure.
[508:35.37]Closed up.
[508:35.97]Bread on all sides.
[508:37.67]Top and bottom.
[508:38.89]A burrito is a sandwich.
[508:39.71]Shit.
[508:49.13]Too much?
[508:50.53]Howzone is a sandwich.

[509:01.70]No, that's- that's correct.
[509:04.02]Taco is not a sandwich.
[509:08.30]By the way, sandwich is just a term now that people use to describe

[510:08.67]No, people don't eat pie with their hands, okay?
[510:13.47]Crust is not bread.
[510:15.81]That's true.
[510:16.15]Yeah, true.
[510:16.99]That's correct.
[510:20.01]Just pick it up, idiot.
[510:22.15]Alright.
[510:23.05]Thank you for the, uh, the discussion.
[510:26.05]A pizza is not a sandwich.
[510:32.51]And... I just... Out of curiosity... Why did you link me... An image of... Like a car on a snow storm?
[510:43.48]A car on a snow mountain?
[510:47.31]What does this have to do with sandwiches?
[510:52.19]It's like a car and like a plow.
[510:55.15]And a plowed road.
[510:59.72]What is it?
[511:00.18]Why did you give me this?
[511:05.28]No, this is freaking me out.
[511:06.26]I don't want- No, I don't- I didn't get an image.
[511:07.80]Never mind.
[511:09.20]The mountain is wrapped.
[511:10.14]It's a snow sandwich.
[511:11.58]The mountain is underneath the snow.
[511:13.75]And the snow- No, there's no snow inside the mountain.
[511:15.77]The mountain's not sitting on snow.
[511:16.81]Sorry.

[512:37.50]Earth is a sandwich.
[512:41.27]No, Earth is a gusher.
[512:44.43]That's not a sandwich, it's a fruit snack.
[512:52.56]Hey Dr. Clay, thanks for the five dollars, 500 bits.
[512:57.45]No bullshit, your god caused utter chaos, but don't have a cow, man.
[513:01.75]I'm sure your citizens won't be seeing red.
[513:03.67]There's been a lot of beef between Murius and your followers, but you just gotta steer Murius in the right direction.
[513:11.71]Before you know it, everyone will say, cowabunga, Murius is one rad god.
[513:16.85]After all, when the stakes are high, he knows what to do.
[513:21.44]Soon your enemies will get the horns after messing with the bull.
[513:25.90]Well, I believe I milked this long enough.
[513:31.92]Hope you enjoyed the puns.
[513:35.32]Hope you enjoyed the 24-hour ban.
[513:46.41]Thanks for the 10 bucks, Clay.
[513:48.21]Thanks a lot, man.
[513:50.19]Hey, Scruffle, thanks for the 300 bits.
[513:53.58]Jerma Otto.
[513:55.38]Hey, thanks.
[513:57.77]Rick Bilby, thanks for 1,000 bits.
[513:59.47]A lot of 10, 10, 10, 15, 15, 20, 20, 50, 50, 50.
[514:02.65]You guys give a lot of money tonight.
[514:04.75]Thanks, guys.
[514:07.32]Uh, Rick Bilby gives 10 bucks and says, Hey, Jerma, I'm gonna go... Jerma, I'm going to the new Massachusetts casino tomorrow, and if I win big, I'll give you a little treat.
[514:16.33]But for now, I want to ask if you have any advice for making new friends.
[514:19.59]I recently pushed myself to do a few new activities to meet new people.
[514:22.93]I sometimes feel like I'm just too awkward or slow for people to... slow to... for people to enjoy my company.
[514:28.75]That's very discouraging.
[514:30.23]Thanks for the laughs, and to be honest, ASMR, like voice, please fart on the face cam.
[514:34.67]You guys...
[514:38.79]Alright, you're looking for advice, and then you end it with, like, please fart on face cam.
[514:43.30]You're throwing me off.
[514:46.12]Alright.
[514:47.30]Making new friends.
[514:52.06]The best place to make new friends, and you've said, you've recently pushed yourself to do a few new activities to meet people.
[515:02.47]You kind of need to do something you already like.
[515:06.72]and that you know that has people around that also like those things.
[515:11.76]Doing something that's new, it's much easier to do new activity with friends and make new friends at new activity than it is to go to new activity and make all brand new friends by yourself.
[515:30.37]Going in groups is much easier for something brand new.
[515:37.57]I'm getting question marks for this?
[515:39.03]What?
[515:41.85]A new activity... Why am I getting question marks for this?
[515:48.61]Did I not say that correctly?
[515:52.55]Doing stuff in groups that all of you have never done before is much easier for you to bounce off each other and meet new people and hang out with people.
[515:59.90]Because it's not just you that has to talk to new people.
[516:05.71]That makes sense, right?
[516:06.87]Yeah, what?
[516:08.69]I'm getting a question mark.
[516:12.37]Yeah, spend money to make money.
[516:16.88]I get it, I get it.
[516:17.66]You just went full... I was pretty articulate.
[516:24.46]Alright, anyways.
[516:26.28]Solo activities.
[516:28.31]It's harder to kind of assimilate yourself into a group.
[516:33.79]But the internet has done so many things to create places for you to hang out and spend time and kind of make friends.
[516:45.48]So you're gonna fart or what?
[516:52.34]Into the webcam?
[516:53.10]I don't know if I can do it into the webcam.
[517:00.97]into the into the web I I didn't have the webcam that just came out I didn't have the webcam on I I you can't time these things guys Jesus Christ sorry there was still some there there's still some in there you can't just let it sit in the chamber it's got to go
[517:32.66]I made a lot of friends on YouTube because people were just, we were doing the same thing.
[517:42.11]You need to find something that you really like that you can do solo that also has other people that are doing it solo at the same time.
[517:49.29]If you really have trouble making friends.
[517:52.13]Tuber friends?
[517:53.21]Oh yeah, tuber friends.
[518:00.80]Jerma, it's 1am.
[518:01.84]Please.
[518:02.20]You gotta go to bed?
[518:03.58]Oh, God.
[518:05.42]Get on to bed!
[518:14.13]Jerma, I don't like Collab's Elbertson giving friend advice.
[518:19.67]That's not what I said.
[518:20.67]Oh, I'm being so twisted.
[518:23.76]I'm being... My words get so twisted.
[518:28.18]Oh!
[518:29.16]Oh!
[518:29.46]Why is it on...
[518:54.23]I'm so glad this is happening not on stream.
[518:57.15]It's on the post-breakdown part of the stream.
[519:02.42]You know how, okay, there's 2,500 people here right now.
[519:05.52]What was there, about 4,000 or 5,000 at the peak of today?
[519:09.00]Imagine doing that when there was twice as many people here.
[519:12.78]How many people would be furious that I did that more than once?
[519:24.33]It would be bad it would be people would be they would be minus twos they'd be like stop stop dude.
[519:30.57]What the fuck?
[519:33.39]This is no this is not canon none of this stuff is can it's all off stream a broadcast is over When this screen pops up streams over Didn't happen on stream But anyways
[519:55.00]No, making friends can be hard.
[519:58.08]It really can be.
[520:00.18]I wish you luck.
[520:00.96]Hopefully you find something that you can care about, that you can be knowledgeable about, and there's other people that are trying to look for people too.
[520:15.01]See how I make my friends?
[520:17.55]Yeah, that's a killer.
[520:20.44]That slays them all.
[520:23.94]I love that one.
[520:28.17]Just make sure you're the loudest farter in the room.
[520:30.53]People will flock to you.
[520:37.08]Especially in a restaurant.
[520:38.52]Alright.
[520:40.24]Goiki, thanks for the 500 bits.
[520:42.70]Really glad I caught the penis stream.
[520:44.20]Thanks, Jeremiah.
[520:44.86]Yeah, thank you.
[520:54.94]Whatever, it's fine.
[520:56.52]What's a penis stream?
[520:57.76]I know.
[520:58.26]I don't know either.
[520:58.82]I said it like four times, though.
[521:01.66]It's my fault.
[521:02.34]It's my fault.
[521:03.78]I take responsibility for this one.
[521:05.08]I'm sorry to hear that.
[521:30.99]Take care of yourself.
[521:39.02]May he rest in peace.
[521:43.72]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[521:55.03]Much love to you.
[521:57.26]And yeah.
[522:00.04]Glad you can take your mind off something.
[522:01.88]And hang out here.
[522:06.16]We got a great bunch of jokers here.
[522:11.62]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[522:14.16]And Chibi-Robo I feel like is going to be a lot of fun.
[522:18.06]I might have to do it over two streams.
[522:19.26]I heard it's like 12 to 15 hours long.
[522:20.80]And that means it's going to be 20 hours long for me.
[522:26.97]You got to add the streaming factor on there.
[522:31.19]Times any game by about 30 to 40%.
[522:33.21]Kind of how it works.
[522:40.84]Yeah.
[522:43.76]Let's run the credits while we have it open here.
[522:46.68]There were a lot of community subs tonight.
[522:49.14]I'm sure you'll see them fly by.
[522:54.63]Let's get to the other screen.
[522:56.31]The true, actual, wind-down stream.
[523:03.17]See you guys on Monday.
[523:05.31]Have a great rest of your night.
[523:06.01]Have a great weekend.
[523:07.99]We're going to come back with Chibi-Robo.
[523:11.31]Maybe one to two streams, depending on how long it takes me to do.
[523:15.31]I really hope I don't hate this game.
[523:19.76]Is that possible?
[523:21.64]Am I gonna not- is it possible that I've been like talking chibi-robo up?
[523:25.02]Am I not gonna like this game?
[523:28.41]You clean and cook food and rearrange furniture, right?
[523:33.27]That's like up there in best genres for me.
[523:38.65]It goes cleaning and furniture moving genre, then RPG, then FPS.
[523:48.47]Okay, good.
[523:55.75]We still have some bits to do.

[524:51.07]You need to do more shitposting.
[524:56.33]Shitpost on Twitter.
[525:04.17]You got a shitpost, Mora.
[525:06.64]Yeah, do I really even care about Twitter?
[525:08.86]You know what I mean?
[525:09.74]For some reason, I've always held, no, I don't want to write that.
[525:11.70]I've written so many fucked up tweets that I just: d- d- d-, delete, delete, delete, d- d- d-, hold delete button - it's gone, gone, gone. Word, word, word, sentance.
[525:24.70]And then I hit escape. Cancel and get out. I do it all the time.

[525:42.39]I'm just gonna be fucking weird 2020.
[525:43.49]I'm gonna lose a lot of followers.
[525:45.63]No, I'm almost over 100,000 followers.
[525:47.50]I don't wanna lose any followers.
[525:48.48]Why would I do that?
[525:51.86]Leave it to the Jerma Penis Music Shitpost channel to, like, do that for me.
[525:56.36]Yeah, we've come to a conclusion.
[526:03.66]You're going to double your followers.
[526:05.10]But anyways, Brynn, thanks for the thousand bits.
[526:08.80]I felt like sending you a message of appreciation for a while.
[526:11.57]Ever since I was first recommended you by a certain rad streamer, I've watched all your content both via VOD and YouTube, even alongside as I work, and via the streams that I can catch on weekends.
[526:24.93]I've been fortunate enough to meet you in person and can attest that you are as genuine and fun as a person as you are on screen.
[526:32.30]I wish you all the best.
[526:36.74]This is a really, really nice message.
[526:38.54]Thank you.
[526:40.60]Glad you found the channel.
[526:41.90]And I'm glad you didn't end this with me putting my hand up and going like this, like this, this, this, closing my hand.
[526:49.48]And that I scanned 15 individual pineapple juices and said there was electrical interference or whatever.
[526:59.17]I'm very happy about that.
[527:00.45]Thank you.
[527:04.97]What are you guys doing?
[527:16.49]What the fuck is this?
[527:19.03]I didn't even- I didn't do this.
[527:21.53]Why is this on the Jerma out of context?
[527:24.09]It's not even me.
[527:30.95]Oh yeah, Jerma out of context.
[527:32.99]Just kidding, it's Jerma's face deep faked onto somebody else.
[527:37.53]Why did you film this?
[527:40.18]Oh, I fucking can't even watch this.
[527:42.76]I closed it.
[527:43.46]I can't even watch it.
[527:44.24]It's freaking me out.
[527:46.18]I can't even watch that.
[527:49.60]Okay.
[527:53.78]But thank you, Brynn.

[533:24.13]Your mother.
[533:25.60]You said, Mom, come here.
[533:26.48]I want to show you something.
[533:27.86]Your mom... Oh, yeah.
[533:28.66]What is it?
[533:29.98]Oh, this.
[533:30.32]It's called penis music.
[533:32.08]Here's a video.
[533:33.18]And it's a guy dancing weird in this music in the background that's going crazy.
[533:39.43]You showed your mother a video that said penis music.
[533:42.61]And then she saw that video of me doing that.
[533:48.58]She's gonna be... Now she's probably gonna want to see all your report cards.
[533:53.90]I didn't do this.
[533:54.40]You did.
[533:55.86]I didn't make that video.
[533:56.76]That's not what I call it.
[534:05.95]You just brought in extra scrutiny from your parents.
[534:11.26]Why would you show your mother that video?
[534:14.96]You should show your mother a fucking B-plus that you got on a test.

[535:18.39]Hey, UnZeroic, thanks for the $2.50.
[535:20.20]Hey, Jerma, what are your thoughts on evil wizards that can cast evil spells while a wizard?
[535:27.10]I would think that, I would hope that, I would think that, I would hope that, I would think that they would be using a Diablo II paladin scepter.
[535:37.02]I wouldn't hear the word wizard.
[535:39.08]That just happens.
[535:41.52]Thank you, Opster Narwhal, for the $2.59.
[535:44.43]Saw the Red Sox jersey and wanted to remind everyone that the Red Sox cheated.
[536:04.06]Hey, thanks for the three dollars actually bad actually true Okay, look let me okay you want me to defend this here what do you want me to say oh shit my Boston Red Sox I'm on that team How could we have done such a thing
[536:32.00]I can't believe I did that.
[536:33.88]I lived in the city that they wear the laundry of that says the city's name on it.
[536:41.42]What have we done?
[536:42.34]What have I done?
[536:43.34]I'm sorry.
[536:45.68]I'm apologizing.
[536:49.01]What do you want me to say?
[536:50.33]They cheated?
[536:50.91]They're assholes.
[536:58.59]That's a condescending villain.
[537:00.17]Ha ha ha.
[537:08.79]What do you want me to say?
[537:10.61]Here's the thing.
[537:11.37]I think people, when they bring this stuff up, like, hey, just want to remind you that the Red Sox cheated.
[537:16.26]You don't deserve, your city didn't deserve that championship.
[537:19.62]What do you want me to be like?
[537:20.36]Be like, yeah, they fucking did.
[537:22.22]I don't care if they cheated.
[537:23.14]I'm a cheater too.
[537:24.64]And then it's like, ha, I knew it.
[537:27.23]All people from Boston are fucking cheating and lying assholes.
[537:30.15]And it's like, oh, no, shut up, idiot.
[537:31.95]No, I'm not.
[537:33.21]I, uh, good.
[537:36.10]I was trying to catch people in this like, yeah, you must condone that too, you Boston bastard.
[537:50.37]I mean, I saved scum all day today, so go ahead and put me in that category.
[537:53.45]Fine.
[537:55.87]Just like the Patriots.
[537:57.29]Just like every goddamn team.
[537:59.04]Guys, you remember baseball back then?
[538:02.62]Back 15 years ago, every single person was injecting steroids and human growth hormones into their body.
[538:12.56]It's a sport based on cheating.
[538:15.20]Where everybody cheated.
[538:18.08]Everybody's cheating.
[538:19.24]They're all cheating.
[538:21.06]They're all cheaters.
[538:22.03]All of them.
[538:26.58]And then what happens is when someone like... How many teams have to get caught before everybody's gotten caught cheating?
[538:35.86]Just legalize it and make a league of superheroes.
[538:49.88]They're all doing this under-the-radar shit, and they know that they're not supposed to be, and it's like, alright, well... The Astros just got caught.
[538:58.88]The Red Sox just got caught.
[539:01.35]Before that, it was like Cleveland.
[539:02.77]Before that, it's the Patriots.
[539:03.73]Before that, it's the Jets.
[539:05.01]Before that, it was the Raiders.
[539:07.13]Remember, like, five years ago, it was the Green Bay Packers.
[539:10.25]And then, remember, they were stealing sides.
[539:12.25]And then, remember, the coaches were working for the other team.
[539:14.81]And you go back, and Pete Rose, Pete Rose bet on the games.
[539:24.54]He's coping.
[539:28.90]Advocating for steroids and animal fighting in the same stream.
[539:37.99]What?
[539:38.91]What the fuck are you talking about?
[539:41.19]I don't care about sports.
[539:44.45]Sad face.
[539:46.61]What are you talking about?
[539:53.09]Just remove pitchers and no one can steal signs.
[539:55.39]Yeah, just have a pitching machine fire... We'll make it fair.
[540:00.83]Have a pitching machine only pitch fastballs right down the middle.
[540:04.85]But they're 120 miles per hour.
[540:08.57]Good luck.
[540:09.89]That makes it a little harder for the batters, I think.
[540:21.57]Maybe for you.
[540:25.58]Oh, the Red Sox cheated.
[540:27.08]How does that make you... You know what that is?
[540:29.28]That's the equivalent of being stopped on the street by somebody with a camera and a microphone.
[540:34.26]Hey, I see that you have the Boston shirt on.
[540:36.16]Yeah, yeah, I do.
[540:36.92]Boston Red Sox.
[540:37.54]I've been up there with my family and I've watched them for years.
[540:40.58]And what do you think of the fact that they cheated in 2018?
[540:42.73]Mike in the face.
[540:43.89]Um, I, um... Well, I mean, I don't condone it.
[540:49.79]Mike is getting really close to my mouth, okay?
[540:53.95]He's still milling.
[540:55.09]Alright, alright.
[540:55.83]Alright, I'm out.
[540:56.89]I can't get over.
[540:57.65]I can't get over.
[540:58.63]Okay, I love the Red Sox.
[541:00.70]Alright, if you fucking come in here and you drop shit on the Red Sox, I'm gonna fight back.
[541:08.88]Even though I haven't watched a regulation exhibition baseball game in over a year and six months.
[541:16.11]I am gonna fight for the Red Sox.
[541:30.36]Anyways, thanks for the... It was like 12... Did you get like 12 bucks?
[541:37.46]Are these real?
[541:37.80]What are these?
[541:38.16]Does that do anything?
[541:39.60]Does that show anything?
[542:02.82]They're on BTTV.
[542:04.98]Oh, okay.
[542:05.67]I was like, when did I enable these?
[542:07.21]Thanks, though.
[542:12.59]A Bitslave, thanks for the $2.50.
[542:14.59]25 cents times... 150, 750, 500.
[542:21.90]150, 750, 500.
[542:23.10]150 times, I don't know, some number that's more than 10.
[542:25.08]Uh, 10.
[542:26.34]Uh, thanks for the 25 cents times 10.
[542:30.08]Jerm, I think you'll like Twisted Fate.
[542:31.50]Twisted Fate is a casino-type champion who has charmed his way across the world.
[542:37.07]I'm never gonna install League.
[542:38.31]It's not gonna happen.
[543:07.24]I don't even like those games.
[543:08.78]Why are you getting the idea that I would even want to play League?
[543:12.96]Considering all the nice things I've said about MOBAs.
[543:24.55]I don't know.
[543:30.62]Don't get your account banned.
[543:32.78]And don't drink full bottles of alcohol.
[543:35.14]Only drink enough to feel, like, slightly good.
[543:37.32]And maybe one more after that, and that's it.
[543:41.04]And be responsible.
[543:42.10]And drink water, too, for God's sake.
[543:46.02]Be careful.
[543:47.08]That stuff's dangerous.
[543:56.83]But thank you.
[543:59.25]Appreciate the, uh, huge money that you've given tonight.
[544:04.39]Oh, yeah.
[544:04.95]A lot of... A lot of colleges' semesters are going to be ending here soon, aren't they?
[544:07.43]Like the next month or two?
[544:08.47]What is it?
[544:08.89]May?
[544:09.03]April?
[544:09.23]Oh, May?
[544:09.37]Late April?
[544:35.72]You're an idiot.
[544:37.32]It's February.
[544:39.92]Mine just started.
[544:40.70]It's February.
[544:41.28]Oh yeah, it is like fucking February.
[544:47.08]And you did just say it's the middle of the semester.
[544:51.27]Oh yeah, kids are getting out of school soon here.
[544:53.19]Sorry, I just did the thing.
[544:55.37]I did the thing.
[544:57.71]Oh yeah, kids are getting out of school here soon.
[544:59.33]Yeah, I see.
[545:00.07]That makes sense.
[545:03.05]I said that all, that's just a response to pretty much anything, really.
[545:14.33]It's the dead middle of the semester.
[545:15.83]Yeah, you said school, you said semester.
[545:19.15]And you said nearing semester.
[545:22.75]So I, oh yeah, kids getting out of school soon.
[545:26.12]Anyways, I've been studying ancient Rome and Greece and I'm slightly disturbed at how accurate everything in Black and White 2 is depicted.
[545:37.75]Really?
[545:40.14]That's kind of... That's fucked up.
[545:45.27]Lots of breeding.
[545:48.49]And then, aw, futz!
[545:49.73]Again, thanks for five more dollars, 500 pitts.
[545:52.57]The Carthaginian named Hannibal was born, and as a kid, he swore to be an enemy of Rome.
[546:01.63]His first battle against Rome was in 216 BC, the Second Punic War.
[546:06.01]There was 6,000 Carthage casualties out of 52,000 army, and 50,000 to 70,000 Roman casualties of their 87,000 person army.
[546:17.90]The Romans were understandably very upset.
[546:21.10]How many of them were killed by a giant rolling boulder?
[546:24.70]I wonder.
[546:26.90]And how many were eaten by a giant cow?
[546:31.51]We'll never know.
[546:32.09]Nobody lived back then.
[546:34.53]We'll never know the real story.
[546:38.05]I say thanks for the entertainment.
[546:39.05]While studying, you're making school bearable.
[546:42.17]P.S.
[546:42.49]Please fart on face cam.
[546:43.75]Nope.
[546:48.11]Somebody said, uh... I want to get the clip.
[546:51.01]I want to get the clip.
[546:51.75]Hold on.
[546:52.05]This is the clip of what?
[546:56.13]Ster?
[546:56.77]Of Star Saint?
[547:03.21]Uh, Mitchell, the person I told to... I was paid a service to say something.
[547:09.73]They gave five more dollars.
[547:10.85]They said, I want to... I want to get the clip.
[547:15.54]I don't know, I feel like they're always on our flanks.
[547:17.60]Hey, Mitchell!
[547:20.32]Mitchell, I really gotta say, after something like, something as generous as that, go fuck yourself.
[547:25.04]He's just mean.
[547:27.25]He just did it on the meanness of his heart.
[547:30.61]I was paid a service.
[547:36.65]He did that just on his own.
[547:38.73]You didn't even pay him.
[547:40.79]Well, you did, but you didn't pay him to say that.
[547:48.78]Hey, Bitslave, thanks for the 500 bits or two 250s.
[547:53.96]Jeremy, this message is for chat.
[547:55.08]I want to say that drinking excessively is not fun or good in any way.
[547:59.52]I have a problem and it sucks.
[548:00.98]Plus, it cost me the one game I play and have fun with for 14 days because I was running it down and spamming obscenities.
[548:08.72]Also, don't touch that shit if you're under 21.
[548:10.58]Capisce?
[548:11.54]Good.
[548:13.78]Listen to this person, please.
[548:19.74]They also say, just realize, Black and White reminds me of this one Flash game that I used to play before I played League of Legends.
[548:26.30]Greatest game of all time.
[548:28.50]It was like you throw your villager or something.
[548:30.72]I forgot.
[548:31.66]Just a hand throwing villagers trying to run off screen or something.
[548:34.30]I forgot what it was called to be exact.
[548:35.50]Does anyone in chat know what this is?
[548:43.04]Pillage the village.
[548:46.12]That's it.
[548:47.06]You got it.
[548:50.66]Hey, Shadows One Disciple.
[548:54.02]Shadows Disciple, thanks for the $2.50.
[548:55.18]Hey, Jerma, what is it like to live so far from most of your family?
[549:00.34]I'm looking to move in the future from Kentucky to Utah.
[549:04.14]So not as far as you went.
[549:05.40]That's still pretty far, though.
[549:07.14]That's still far.
[549:09.22]But very far.
[549:09.80]I guess the main difference with me is that I'm single and also an only child.
[549:13.70]I really don't like it here.
[549:14.70]Not because of people or politics or anything.
[549:16.74]But I think it might be difficult to live so far from my family.
[549:19.98]Thanks, Jerma.
[549:23.20]Um, yeah, I was fortunate enough to have my girlfriend, who was just going to follow me anywhere, and will, we're going to continue to.
[549:39.59]Also had a buddy, Alex, he's right over there, that also was, wanted to check it out and do it for a little while, and it's much easier with other people.
[549:49.05]It really is.
[549:58.57]But with that being said, how do I do it?
[550:04.94]A lot of people have come up here.
[550:07.72]And again, this is another thing of how I'm pretty fortunate with this too.
[550:11.40]I mean, I live in Las Vegas.
[550:13.78]And that's a destination people are like, yeah, I got a trip to Vegas in two months.
[550:18.45]I'm like, okay, I live here.
[550:19.93]Oh, yeah, great.
[550:20.57]I'll see you.
[550:21.09]A lot of people come up here.
[550:24.99]But Utah is actually a pretty great state from what I hear.
[550:29.29]People will come to you, is what I'm saying.
[550:31.49]Especially with some of the cool shit that you could find and entice people to come up.
[550:39.50]Is it?
[550:39.82]Yeah, Utah's supposed to be pretty good.
[550:46.18]What's wrong with Utah?
[550:54.60]Doubt?
[550:54.86]What do you mean, doubt?
[550:59.69]The Grand Canyon is in Utah.
[551:02.43]That's kind of... That's one of the biggest marvels of our entire fucking world.
[551:38.80]Grand Canyon doesn't pass through Utah.
[551:41.66]I thought it did.
[551:42.30]I thought it passed through Utah.
[551:44.48]It doesn't.
[551:48.04]No.
[551:49.58]I thought it did.
[551:51.76]I thought it hit the... I thought it hit, like, the bottom.
[551:55.51]Like, the south, uh... I thought it hit, like, the south fucking... Like, the southern point of the state.
[552:01.53]It doesn't.
[552:09.21]No, it's only in Arizona.
[552:09.81]Fuck.
[552:21.16]What about those salt lakes?
[552:22.32]Those salt lakes are pretty sick.
[552:25.54]Salt Lake City.
[552:26.94]It's a great fucking place from what I've heard.
[552:29.70]Look, I'm gonna fix this.
[552:33.14]I'm gonna fucking enlighten some of you guys.
[552:39.61]Utah is actually pretty high up in the rankings of states' rankings.
[552:46.66]Utah... No, this is not bullshit.
[552:48.68]Take a look.
[552:50.10]I want you to see this.
[552:53.18]Utah is in the top ten in healthcare, top ten in education, the second strongest economy, the third best infrastructure in the entire country, one of the most fiscally stable, and one of the safest states in the country.
[553:11.82]Okay, that's real data.
[553:13.20]Nevada is pretty low.
[553:20.87]Nevada is like 38.
[553:27.88]Sounds stupid.
[553:28.44]Why don't you just move to rank one?
[553:38.83]I wanna go to rank... What is Nevada?
[553:41.39]Nevada's 37.
[553:42.11]Nevada has two things that are going for it.
[553:46.48]It's top 10 economy and top 5 in infrastructure.
[553:52.72]And this is based off of... You can pull up each one.
[553:56.36]This is actually a really, really interesting website because I sat here for like... a couple hours picking out individual states and being like, why is that?
[554:07.09]Education, how?
[554:07.99]Why?
[554:15.15]Massachusetts is number eight.
[554:17.71]Explain infrastructure.
[554:19.15]Roads, bridges, buildings.
[554:24.53]Infrastructure.
[554:25.19]Like the actual... Delaware number one.
[554:33.98]Florida is the best state in the world.
[554:37.70]What state has the best healthcare?
[554:38.92]Hawaii and Massachusetts.
[554:40.04]I mean, that's a no-brainer.
[554:44.51]Massachusetts has some of the best hospitals on Earth.
[554:46.67]So, I mean, it makes sense.
[554:47.49]Hawaii, though.
[554:52.99]Massachusetts, number one in education.
[554:56.32]Colorado, number one for economy.
[554:59.26]Oregon, number one in infrastructure.
[555:01.68]New Hampshire, number one in opportunity.
[555:03.18]I actually was going to move to New Hampshire.
[555:04.46]It was one of the places I wanted to go to.
[555:08.38]Fiscal stability, Tennessee.
[555:10.12]Tennessee.
[555:11.46]Tennessee.
[555:15.15]New Hampshire is also the safest state in the country.
[555:18.95]And Rhode Island has the best natural environment, which is air quality, water quality, etc.
[555:33.89]It's getting expensive.
[555:36.72]Yeah, Rhode Island is... Rhode Island is actually almost at the very bottom for infrastructure.
[555:43.02]Which means the roads are dog shit.
[555:45.36]Like, the power lines are all in disarray.
[555:48.78]Bridges are fucking falling apart.
[555:52.46]But, it's got some of the cleanest air.
[555:55.56]It has the cleanest air and cleanest water in America.
[555:58.90]And top five in healthcare.
[556:01.82]So, great doctors in Rhode Island.
[556:09.00]Anyways, um, oh yeah, Utah.
[556:12.13]Utah's supposed to be a really great place to live, and that's how I knew that, because I looked at that state's rankings list.
[556:21.37]Don't base your future on a top 10 list.
[556:25.15]Well, then I'm gonna have to unsubscribe from BuzzFeed, WatchBojo.
[556:29.49]How am I gonna exist?
[556:40.67]States tier list.
[556:41.86]I can't do a states tier list because I haven't been to every state in the country.
[556:48.04]I've been to a lot of them.
[556:48.96]I haven't been to all of them.
[556:51.78]What states have I been to?
[556:57.55]No, no, no, no.
[556:58.59]That's going to take too long.
[557:00.85]We'll do this another day.
[557:02.99]Start walking, Buster.
[557:04.27]Buster.
[557:09.54]Anyways, we got only a few more to do.
[557:12.00]Stream is over.
[557:13.50]Good night.
[557:13.98]Goodbye.
[557:15.39]Take care of yourselves.
[557:17.49]See you guys on Monday.
[557:23.21]But, how's it to live so far with my family?
[557:26.01]I... It's easier with people around you.
[557:34.18]But that being said, I mean, I grew up around tons of friends that were back in Massachusetts.
[557:41.41]My whole family network is back there.
[557:44.05]And I do miss them.
[557:44.81]I do miss them all the time.
[557:47.43]They do come up periodically.
[557:50.04]But, you know, you try to make your own home.
[557:54.20]And then people come to your home and you make your own way over here, right?
[558:03.03]And that's the thing.
[558:03.75]You can still go back.
[558:04.47]You can still visit.
[558:06.67]You can spend a weekend.
[558:08.65]Have somebody spend three or four days.
[558:10.41]Try to get somebody to see if they can spend some time with you.
[558:14.79]Almost where you feel at home.
[558:16.13]That's right.
[558:18.77]Good point.
[558:23.25]He's doing the wholesome excuse.
[558:27.36]Nine hour starting screen.
[558:29.56]Shit.
[558:47.01]Part of me wants to do this, but it's gonna take too much effort and I'm tired Have the starting soon screen be on and just actually leave for like 15 minutes and you guys Talk about how I think he fucking turned it on.
[559:03.40]I don't know what he's doing It's been nine and a half hours.
[559:06.12]Nobody can get a hold of him.
[559:07.44]I
[559:09.18]I don't think he realizes that the stream's been on, he hasn't done anything.
[559:12.60]And then I come back, camera pointed at me, I turn the webcam on, lights turned off, and, like, in the bathrobe.
[559:19.53]And, like, make my eyes, like, watery and red and be like, what the fuck's going on?
[559:28.73]And then, like, two people would have maybe trickled in at that point by then and make his drill.
[559:43.19]It's elaborate.
[559:43.95]It's too elaborate.
[559:44.74]I gotta go.
[559:45.54]I'm tired.
[559:46.18]I'm going.
[559:47.40]No, I can't.
[559:48.14]I can't.
[559:48.46]I'm tired.
[559:48.94]I'm tired.
[559:49.38]I need to eat.
[559:50.22]I haven't eaten in nine and a half hours.
[559:51.70]I have to eat some food.
[559:54.10]What the fuck?
[559:56.44]Alright, save that one.
[559:57.48]We'll do that one next time.

[560:33.64]It's fucking funny as hell.
[560:34.77]But she said that because she doesn't understand what you do, I explained it to her and she was like, oh, okay.
[560:41.99]The title of the video is penis music.
[560:47.97]You didn't show somebody a video that's your mother that was funny dance video.
[560:53.76]No, it was penis music.
[560:55.72]There's already going to be something weird that you're doing.
[560:57.60]You're showing that to your mother.
[561:00.76]That's already going to be weird from the very beginning.
[561:14.02]Oh my god, please fucking do the bathrobe bit.
[561:16.74]I want to be laughing about it just a little bit.
[561:18.52]No, I can't, I can't.
[561:20.00]I'm hungry.
[561:21.28]And when I don't eat, I get angry.
[561:29.33]Sheepish deep dish.
