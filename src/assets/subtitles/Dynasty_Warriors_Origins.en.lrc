[ve:61.1.100]

[00:39.33]Hey, I. I'm so sorry I didn't mean to get me started.
[00:44.69]I didn't mean to press the button.
[00:47.27]I clicked it accidentally.
[00:48.51]I was clicking all I had a bunch of things going on.
[00:50.73]I had my checking my settings.
[00:52.21]I didn't mean to press the button.
[00:53.95]Click it.
[00:54.73]Sorry I clicked it.
[00:57.11]But I mean I clicked it so I mean now that I clicked it, I'm I'm here.
[01:00.13]I mean what?
[01:04.11]What's the harm in streaming for a couple hours, right?
[01:08.59]How's it going?
[01:11.37]I just kind of got up this morning and I forgot Dynasty Warriors came out.
[01:17.27]The new one.
[01:17.69]I was like, I kind of want to play that.
[01:21.81]It's I remember the old old Dynasty Warriors.
[01:26.25]There was a point where Dynasty Warriors was kind of like the Madden of action games.
[01:32.33]There's just a shitload.
[01:33.17]It was like 15 of them.
[01:34.79]One came out like every other year, every year, whatever it was.
[01:42.18]I loved those games.
[01:43.24]I was a huge... Well, I don't want to say I'm a huge fan of Dynasty Warriors.
[01:46.88]Because a bunch of people will probably come in here and be like, Oh, he's a huge fan.
[01:49.52]He must know what to do.
[01:51.90]He must know all the mechanics.
[01:53.04]I don't.
[01:54.24]I don't know anything.
[01:55.52]I just liked it.
[01:56.20]Somebody's saying I got ads.
[02:03.68]I just got an ED ad?
[02:04.58]Like a...
[02:10.77]Yeah, you'll get pre-rolls in the very beginning because... I mean, I don't know.
[02:17.52]This is something I gotta figure out.
[02:20.55]I really don't want to run ads in the beginning of the stream.
[02:23.35]I feel like that's horrible.
[02:27.74]You know what I'm saying?
[02:28.26]Like like a 30 if you get like a 15 to 30 second pre roll versus showing up to the stream and getting hit with like a three minute pre roll that no.
[02:36.73]I don't want to do that to people.
[02:39.43]Even if it turns them off, I don't.
[02:41.29]I don't think I want to do that at the very beginning.
[02:50.68]Yeah, the only way you can turn off pre-rolls is if you run ads, but I don't want to run ads in the beginning of a stream.
[02:57.45]But people get pre-rolls in the beginning of a stream.
[02:59.47]I don't know.
[03:01.77]Still trying to figure it all out.
[03:09.49]How do you feel about going to the bathroom with the door open?
[03:11.96]Close the door.
[03:12.36]What are you, what are you, what are you, we live in a fucking barn?
[03:16.52]What are you, hey, what do we live in a barn?
[03:18.88]Close the door.
[03:25.83]Could just run them and get like coffee.
[03:29.69]Yeah, I... Let's ease into this, right?
[03:35.00]These are all really good suggestions and things, but I want to ease into it a little.
[03:41.88]So let's ease into it.
[03:46.30]This stream is going to be very laid back.
[03:47.53]I'm just going to be hanging out playing.
[03:49.27]Just kind of felt the urge, so...
[03:54.97]One day, what happened to one day only?
[03:59.44]Well, to be fair, I did say, and I got to make this statement too.
[04:02.98]I did say I might be live 30 days in a row or not for like three months straight.
[04:10.20]There's a range there.
[04:12.52]And it's funny because we've kind of done both of those.
[04:16.99]The last time I was live as of like four or five days ago was like once in October or like September.
[04:24.32]So you're getting the best of both the extremes here.
[04:30.46]Just for one month.
[04:38.84]I thought about like, okay, is it funny to do a
[04:43.60]Oh, we're going 30 days in a row.
[04:47.88]Blowout retirement streams.
[04:50.76]It's like I already did that shit.
[04:52.31]Like you said this like a year two years ago, man.
[04:54.69]Like it's just have to get over that.
[05:00.60]No, I'm just here.
[05:01.30]I'm just hanging out like we're not doing any of that.
[05:09.57]We love when you have a forked tongue.
[05:11.97]We love when your forked tongue lies for the greater good.
[05:15.45]What about the channel points update?
[05:23.85]I won't have an update until probably next week for that.
[05:36.41]Is retirement just a moot point now?
[05:38.67]well it's it's tricky because you know you say something you gotta stick to it and obviously I um started working at off-brand and stopped streaming a lot and said yeah I'm kind of done I said I was like soft retired until I retired and I kind of still want that I'm not really changing my opinion of it kind of just leaving it open at this point now to
[06:04.49]Like I said before, just whenever the fuck, you know what?
[06:06.49]I feel like going for four or five days in a row.
[06:08.08]Fuck it.
[06:08.32]Let's do it.
[06:10.92]That might happen.
[06:11.76]It could.
[06:13.31]But the philosophy is going to stay the same.
[06:20.98]Yeah, no schedule, no expectations on when or how or where.
[06:25.08]But, you know, you could see a few in a row.
[06:26.52]You might not see anything for two or three weeks.
[06:29.89]Like, you kind of can't tell.
[06:32.17]I just don't want to set the expectations for people that... Okay, here we go.
[06:37.29]Let's do some streams.
[06:38.55]And it's like, oh, where is he?
[06:39.69]It's been three weeks.
[06:42.62]So I'm just trying to set those expectations.
[06:45.74]Perfectly clear.
[06:50.38]You've been doing a big project ever again.
[06:51.86]I mean, there are projects that are currently being worked on right now.
[06:55.74]That I wouldn't call them gigantic dollhouse type projects, but they're interesting, I think.
[07:02.94]Hopefully they are.
[07:03.46]A little bit smaller in the scale.
[07:09.19]Not necessarily a big show where there's a bunch of shit going on.
[07:12.69]No, just...
[07:15.60]Just whatever.
[07:15.98]Alright, I've been kind of yapping in the very beginning here.
[07:19.90]I've been talking a lot.
[07:23.88]Dynasty Warriors.
[07:24.76]We're going to play it.
[07:31.57]Throw all your expectations.
[07:32.77]Yeah, that's what you have to do.
[07:33.77]Throw all your expectations out the window.
[07:43.02]You have any idea how ridiculous this game is?
[07:44.62]I've played all the other ones.
[07:47.14]The old ones.
[07:48.62]Yeah, I know you kind of just... There's like 500 people on screen.
[07:52.18]This is apparently the best one in years.
[07:53.78]That's why I want to play it.
[08:08.74]And honestly, I woke up this morning and I was like, you know what?
[08:12.08]I heard about it.
[08:12.92]I heard it was good.
[08:13.54]And I heard people liked it.
[08:15.44]So I'm like, I want to play it.
[08:16.34]And I'm like, wait, I want to play this new game that's come out.
[08:20.48]That very rare... I don't do that.
[08:21.85]I don't just play a new game.
[08:22.95]So I'm like, what the... I'm just going to turn the stream on.
[08:24.83]Let's go.
[08:25.31]Let's figure it out together.
[08:32.21]And then you accidentally turn... Yeah, and then I accidentally press the button.
[08:34.89]You're right.
[08:37.29]What about Nancy Drew?
[08:40.36]I told you a couple days ago that Nancy Drew and an Infinity Nikki hit check was going to happen within a week of that stream from two days ago.
[08:51.61]That's still accurate.
[09:00.59]Okay, you guys ready?
[09:02.71]I'm going to throw it over here.
[09:03.61]I should be.
[09:07.85]There we go.
[09:10.63]Alright, everybody.
[09:13.46]No, not yet?
[09:14.12]What, you're not ready?
[09:17.90]Why am I getting a 20-minute Red Hulk ad?
[09:21.46]I think your browser might have crashed.
[09:23.76]I don't know.
[09:26.05]Can you imagine getting a 20-minute ad and you can't skip it?
[09:31.89]Alright.
[09:33.39]Would it be...
[09:35.77]I can't think of a time where like a 10 to 20 minute ad that you can't skip, that you have to watch would be worth it for anything.
[09:47.10]I can't think of any content that I'd be like, yeah, alright, I'll watch a full TV show worth of ads before the show, like before the thing starts.
[09:54.21]I don't think so.
[09:57.83]every movie yeah but when you okay when you go to the theater the this the previews of the movie theater are like exclusive ads nobody else is seeing these only you in the theater because this movie just came out today and look all these things that oh shh here look at these previews you have to be in here to see these no that's not even true anymore I'm talking like it's 1998.
[10:22.34]Um, that has... They released the trailer like three months... Okay, they released like ten trailers in advance.
[10:27.34]Of every fucking movie now.
[10:28.88]I'm completely wrong.
[10:32.46]Alright, I'm gonna... Let me pee.
[10:33.74]And then we'll get started.
[10:34.76]Because I want to get the pee out of me.
[10:38.27]And you know what?
[10:38.69]I'm gonna experiment here.
[10:39.59]Are you ready?
[10:40.01]I'm gonna go pee.
[10:41.35]Let's... I'm gonna kill the pre-rolls for the next hour.
[10:43.91]Okay?
[10:46.77]Let's continue the experiment.
[10:49.43]I'm gonna go pee.
[10:50.07]I'm gonna fill my coffee up.
[10:51.01]And we'll get started.
[14:39.37]OK, hello.
[14:40.65]I don't want to go out so.
[14:46.23]Yeah, we're back, I think.
[14:49.59]We should be good for the next hour.
[14:53.68]Shouldn't get any.
[14:54.34]Nobody should get pre rolls, but it looks like it's good.
[14:56.68]I give me one more minute.
[14:57.84]Let me just go take care of auto and we will sit down and play.
[15:52.94]He's just gonna run pre-roll.
[15:54.32]He's gonna run ads and an intro screen.
[15:57.10]That would be fucking hell.
[16:01.68]Nah, I just want to give Oro a snack and I'll be right back.
[17:20.34]OK, hello.
[17:22.23]Also too.
[17:22.69]Hold on, let me oh shit.
[17:35.46]Alright, we can go.
[17:37.54]Also, the thing of what I was going to bring up.
[17:40.60]There's a kind of a case to make two of a longer starting soon screen.
[17:44.53]How do you guys feel about that too?
[17:52.99]Because a lot of times when I stream, it's like... I could turn the stream on and not be late.
[18:04.60]And it could just be... I could just kind of be like, hey, I'm still running.
[18:07.18]I'm still hanging out 10 minutes.
[18:14.95]Where... God, I wish the microphone was not unmuted.
[18:29.27]Have an 18 minute pre-show.
[18:30.27]Well, I was talking for like 5-10 minutes before.
[18:32.01]I just left to take care of Otto.
[18:36.50]We were just kind of talking.
[18:39.00]Alright, you guys ready?
[18:39.98]Let's play.
[18:49.81]Can you hear it?
[18:52.35]I can't hear it.
[18:57.69]Oh, what do I do with the volume?
[18:59.05]Alright, one more second.
[19:10.00]OK.
[19:12.28]Are you ready for Dynasty Warriors?
[19:16.72]Is this 360p?
[19:18.14]What?
[19:18.88]That's not.
[19:23.40]Why is this at 8 bits?
[19:27.19]It's not look.
[19:31.37]Graphics look 3840X2160.
[19:39.09]The music is very good.
[19:41.29]This this little intro screen this this main menu is sounds great.
[19:44.25]I've been humming it and I've only heard it for like 10 minutes.
[19:51.45]Is it low quality?
[19:52.24]It might just be the I don't know, maybe the menu.
[19:55.60]I might be a bug in my game too.
[20:01.29]Is it supposed to look like this?
[20:04.21]Is your game look like this?
[20:11.53]Maybe it's just you.
[20:13.11]Just menu.
[20:13.56]Alright, let's go.
[20:15.00]Perform initial setup.
[20:16.48]Oh God, was that?
[20:17.08]Is that going to like fuck my computer?
[20:20.26]Yeah, that sounds good.
[20:24.40]Brightness.
[20:26.89]Alright, where do you guys think is the correct place to put this?
[20:32.86]Are you guys?
[20:33.22]Do you guys like more brightness or less brightness dark?
[20:38.60]Depending what the game is, I usually like 23 notches up.
[20:46.69]I think it's fine.
[20:50.95]Choose a difficulty.
[20:51.95]OK, this is important.
[20:54.74]Difficulty settings can be changed after starting the game.
[20:56.93]Alright, so just do normal.
[21:01.39]Yeah, I'll do Wayfarer.
[21:05.29]Advanced settings menu.
[21:08.77]Do I care about any of this right now?
[21:12.85]Do maximum?
[21:13.97]No, I'm not going to do maximum.
[21:19.92]Okay, battle assistance.
[21:21.84]Helpful.
[21:22.96]Simplified or none.
[21:24.72]Pause when various information... Okay, yeah.
[21:26.50]I'm going to keep it to default.
[21:28.62]Auto-use meat buns.
[21:31.73]Automatically eat meat buns.
[21:32.85]Oh, yeah.
[21:33.79]That's fine.
[21:35.45]Please turn subtitles on.
[21:36.89]I don't want a ton of vibration.
[21:41.91]I don't want any vibration at all, actually.
[21:48.95]Uh...
[21:51.28]Yeah, I can come back in here and care about this later.
[21:53.36]Oh, subtitles.
[22:00.77]Where is subtitles?
[22:06.59]Yeah, that's fine.
[22:07.79]Put them on medium.
[22:08.33]Dialogue display, text only, or window?
[22:13.10]Either one.
[22:15.54]Alright, let's do it.
[22:21.64]Are you guys ready to check out Dynasty Warriors Origins?
[22:31.59]Yeah.
[22:34.45]Yeah.
[22:36.46]Yeah.
[22:37.38]I'm so excited.
[22:48.22]This mouse off the screen.
[22:51.14]Alright.
[23:07.33]This is fucking... I think this is one of the best games to come out this year.
[23:09.83]Holy... Oh my god.
[23:32.90]I actually did hear that people really, really like this one.
[23:35.34]Apparently people think it's the best one in a long time, yeah.
[23:49.80]Grass and bark as time went on, they began to perish.
[23:57.43]Government officials did nothing to remedy the situation.
[23:59.35]On the contrary, they raised taxes to fill their own coffers.
[24:02.99]And they ran ads.
[24:05.62]Peasant stuff.
[24:09.72]Are you okay?
[24:12.92]Drink this.
[24:16.25]Father, are you...
[24:26.65]What a miserable place.
[24:28.45]Please, allow us to have some.
[24:31.45]Have mercy on us.
[24:32.47]Think of the children.
[24:38.02]Move.
[24:40.00]You're pathetic.
[24:41.92]Shall I put you out of your misery?
[24:44.28]Wait.
[24:44.70]Taxes.
[24:47.04]What you carry is a gift from the Emperor to starving people.
[24:52.85]What justification could you possibly have for ignoring their plight?
[24:58.59]Such insolence.
[24:59.98]How dare you speak to me like that?
[25:03.54]Insolence?
[25:04.62]This merchant has confessed everything.
[25:08.48]You had him purchase goods from corrupt scholars and sell them for you in the city.
[25:15.29]In exchange...
[25:17.05]He offered you bribes and business favors.
[25:20.73]Because of this, you are going to funnel 15,000 people onto the same screen and just walk into my blade.
[25:32.52]Can't wait to get a 200 kill combo.
[25:37.31]Son, wait!
[25:38.99]No, closer!
[25:45.01]That's a cool sword.
[25:51.98]What exactly?
[26:14.80]I don't know who you are, but you have my thanks.
[26:19.89]Call for reinforcements!
[26:21.71]Can't wait to hold down B. More soldiers are coming!
[26:26.89]Hey, you two.
[26:28.51]This way.
[26:34.37]Alright.
[26:39.94]We won't be putting the townspeople at risk here.
[26:43.67]You can fight without restraint.
[26:45.85]Long hair is still much I must do.
[26:47.77]But I swear that I will get you out of here.
[26:55.41]How does it run?
[26:55.95]Is it optimized trustworthy?
[26:58.87]But either way, we'll have to cut our way through.
[27:02.01]OK.
[27:09.44]Oh, I do get plays.
[27:18.39]Alright, the music, I remember the music.
[27:19.83]The music was pretty awesome.
[27:23.92]Here we go.
[27:25.22]It's always so funny to me, it's like...
[27:42.44]in these games and all games like this these armies are kind of it's like your army is the equivalent of the putties from the power rangers the only thing that's missing is that you know you guys remember the putties from the power rangers
[28:06.63]We must break through the guard post up ahead.
[28:10.09]As long as we get past the post will be beyond their jurisdiction and out of their reach.
[28:18.72]Yeah, the putties they made they they they went like.
[28:24.24]I know even when I was younger, even I was like, why did I do that?
[28:26.84]But why are they make?
[28:27.48]Why are they doing this?
[28:28.14]Don't let them get away.
[28:29.41]Strike them down.
[28:32.49]Is there a parry?
[28:39.27]They're made out of clay.
[28:41.45]They can't speak.
[28:43.63]Okay, but still... They have vocal cords.
[28:47.05]Because they go...
[29:13.53]Evade.
[29:14.85]Oh, there's a dog.
[29:15.47]I'll teach them what it means to defy us.
[29:22.13]While evading strong attack.
[29:23.83]The way you shift between defense and offense appears so effortless.
[29:30.88]All those guys he just hit were tied together at the waist.
[29:33.78]This has bought us some time.
[29:37.49]The guard post is close.
[29:39.43]Let us go.
[29:45.06]This is classic Dynasty Warriors music.
[29:46.84]Yeah, it's pretty good.
[29:49.80]It's pretty great.
[29:57.10]Boy, I was just looking at chat.
[29:57.94]Am I going the wrong way?
[30:01.92]I might have to turn down like the fog settings.
[30:05.29]It's running fine right now, but I feel like it's not going to run great.
[30:08.35]You already lost.
[30:12.37]I was walking around in a circle.
[30:13.55]I was looking at chat.
[30:14.19]I'm fine.
[30:24.98]Is there a double jump?
[30:26.72]I like the evade.
[30:29.44]Think about, okay, so I remember Dynasty Warriors.
[30:31.20]You can do like X, X, Y. Yep, you can do X, Y. You can do X, X, X, Y. It's a different move.
[30:42.35]Usually the X and then single Y is a knockup, right?
[30:50.63]You got lost on a straight path.
[30:52.57]Well, no, what I did is I took my eyes off the road to look over at you guys.
[30:57.39]You're going the wrong way again.
[31:02.51]Okay, I'm going to stop talking.
[31:04.14]Okay, I'm not talking to you guys anymore.
[31:09.36]This is called holding left analog stick and looking over at the other monitor.
[31:16.50]You know, that's my biggest problem.
[31:17.44]I think I just figured out my problem with streaming video games for me.
[31:23.28]When I talk to chat, I'm just going to let go of all the buttons.
[31:26.64]That's the problem, right?
[31:28.25]Alright, it's this way, right?
[31:31.53]I always just continue to keep moving.
[31:36.71]It's not this way?
[31:37.55]Is it actually not this way?
[31:42.99]It's not our fault.
[31:43.78]No, it's my fault for holding the buttons down and looking over at the other screen for like 30 straight seconds.
[31:49.88]Am I still going the wrong way?
[31:51.28]What?
[31:53.52]How did I fuck this up so bad?
[31:54.95]I was not even looking at the fucking screen.
[32:00.69]Stop moving.
[32:01.57]Just follow the NPC.
[32:02.49]The NPC's following me.
[32:03.43]He doesn't know where the fuck he's going either.
[32:12.28]Alright, where do I go from here?
[32:13.92]I need to reset because I actually was holding W and looking at the other monitor and just talking to you guys.
[32:20.10]Alright, I'm not looking at chat for at least five minutes.
[32:36.22]All the NPCs.
[32:36.96]Well, NPCs stopped moving.
[32:38.10]Oh, okay, I'm good.
[32:40.32]I haven't even had my coffee this morning.
[32:43.32]Relax.
[32:44.46]And I see your comment on the YouTube video, by the way.
[32:48.15]I can't believe you.
[32:51.41]What's wrong with him?
[32:52.15]I can't believe it.
[32:52.83]There's nothing wrong with me.
[32:54.35]I haven't had my coffee this morning.
[32:56.67]Alright, let's go.
[33:05.23]That's a symptom of running in a circle with the analog and talking and not even looking.
[33:10.27]I'm not even processing the images that are on the screen.
[33:12.57]I ask you this.
[33:14.99]Do you choose to continue being exploited until you die?
[33:28.97]Oh, gosh.
[33:30.55]That guitarist had to play for so long.
[33:33.15]Yeah, that solo went on for a long time.
[33:35.01]He was like, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[33:37.89]Like, come on, Jerma.
[33:38.71]Like, fuck.
[33:39.59]I can't do this fucking solo for ten minutes.
[33:41.79]My fingers hurt.
[33:44.26]And witness a new era of peace.
[33:54.84]Let's go.
[33:57.70]Easy, don't bump into me.
[34:00.08]Watch out, watch out.
[34:02.24]Everybody stay in your predetermined lanes that we have.
[34:04.78]Okay, let's go long haired man.
[34:11.51]Alright, this is Dynasty Warriors.
[34:14.83]You can tell when somebody's fucking playing this game.
[34:26.72]Don't you get a map?
[34:30.40]Where you can see where you need to go?
[35:05.81]Let's go.
[35:08.81]Yes.
[35:10.40]Yes.
[35:13.14]No evil may withstand such a righteous blade.
[35:16.40]Alright, I'm going to fall back.
[35:17.30]I got to fall back.
[35:17.84]We cannot allow ourselves to be pushed back here.
[35:27.57]Let me handle this.
[35:28.43]I mean, it feels pretty good so far.
[35:30.57]At least this first minute or two.
[35:35.23]What?
[35:35.39]Whoa!
[35:41.00]Oh, my God.
[35:46.12]Oh, that's a special move.
[35:57.36]Yeah, this feels pretty great.
[36:10.16]Oh, you can charge the attacks too, cool.
[36:15.98]Alright, I don't know if I'm running back in.
[36:23.53]All these guys, this just happened to them?
[36:25.53]They went into the jumpy house.
[36:27.94]And then they all came back.
[36:29.88]I don't know if I would have... Oh, okay.
[36:31.76]It switches between people.
[36:43.01]I was going to say, there is a lock-on.
[36:48.17]Oh, that's cool.
[36:51.31]I think I might change the key bindings.
[36:56.26]Because right trigger to dodge, I'd rather have that on B, and I'll do right trigger for the special effect.
[37:13.12]What's going on?
[37:16.12]We did it we did it Let us head somewhere we can rest
[37:55.39]How are you not hitting everybody with friendly fire?
[38:00.33]We have magical phase blades that can detect who's on our team and on their team.
[38:07.40]And it phases through.
[38:09.22]You know, I didn't have the chance to thank you.
[38:19.44]I am very grateful for your help.
[38:25.58]Though it was rude of me to accept it without even asking your name.
[38:29.68]Tell me, what do you call?
[38:31.25]I have to put my name in?
[38:33.77]Wanderer.
[38:52.14]It didn't replace it.
[38:52.98]That's fine.
[39:06.65]I take it you are a warrior traveling the land like myself.
[39:10.97]From where do you hail?
[39:13.79]I come from... I cannot say.
[39:16.17]Well, I don't know because the game hasn't told us yet.
[39:21.50]That is quite intriguing.
[39:24.92]You fought with such effortless skill.
[39:27.84]I've never seen anything like it.
[39:31.54]I'm curious to know where you trained.
[39:35.11]Self-taught.
[39:39.51]Okay.
[39:40.33]Okay.
[39:40.97]I. Why is there a dialogue choice here?
[39:48.94]It's the same, but it's the same choice.
[39:51.34]It's the same.
[39:54.05]I always find this so funny.
[40:02.88]And the response is just silence anyways.
[40:06.49]How much are we talking?
[40:08.37]Why are you 39 and already senile?
[40:29.71]I see you walking honorable path wielding your blade for the week.
[40:33.53]I think you are just.
[40:38.48]Overreacting, OK?
[40:44.14]By your parents or teacher, perhaps as a mean chatter.
[40:49.34]Whoever it was has taught you well.
[40:53.50]This music does not match the energy level of the scene, but you mean like although how loud is that car turned on?
[40:58.37]Are you aware that there have been many similar happenings of late?
[41:06.55]Soldiers and officials alike.
[41:09.07]Oppressed the people for personal gain.
[41:11.73]And the people must turn to thievery for food.
[41:14.86]All the while an endless rain has rotted the wheat.
[41:19.08]And the winds have brought.
[41:20.24]Remember the other ones you could get weapons.
[41:22.00]Countless lives have been lost.
[41:23.48]Can you like get items in this game like upgrades and weapons and armor and stuff?
[41:28.24]Perhaps this is heaven's way of lamenting the state of the land.
[41:33.16]Yes.
[41:33.66]Ooh.
[41:36.16]Is that where your doubts lie?
[41:38.78]You are an odd one.
[41:42.44]I am sure you have also heard rumors about the way of the Great Peace.
[41:48.70]They are a cult that follows a great sage called Zhang Xiao.
[41:53.12]Recently, I've been hearing their ranks are growing rapidly.
[41:59.33]Hmm.
[42:00.81]Their promises of a brighter future must be drawing in the powerless masses.
[42:08.53]I've spoken too much.
[42:10.43]It has already grown late.
[42:13.13]Put on the Chinese dub and the English subtitles.
[42:16.91]I could do that.
[42:35.06]When are we going to get more realism in video games?
[42:37.80]You never ever see somebody in one of these cutscenes where they're just hanging out.
[42:42.45]Like put their fist up to their mouth and like do the kind of burp into their mouth and like... Nobody ever does it.
[42:53.05]I want more like realistic scenes.
[43:03.98]Oh, he's got a headache.
[43:04.60]Alright.
[43:06.76]I had a headache today.
[43:08.42]I really like this character.
[43:09.24]I had a headache.
[43:10.74]A country that has long been divided will reunite.
[43:14.89]One that has long been united.
[43:16.37]I'm at work, I can't read the subs.
[43:19.67]Long ago, the Han Dynasty was founded by Emperor Gaozu and reestablished by Emperor Guangwu.
[43:29.28]And yet, heaven's will is now clear.
[43:33.99]The coming age will inevitably be one of great chaos.
[43:41.27]That is why.
[43:44.41]You must bring peace to the world.
[43:47.58]Actually, I think I want I want to put on the Chinese.
[43:50.60]But already lies within you.
[43:53.40]I'm I look over at the screen.
[43:56.30]I would have to read too.
[43:57.94]And I don't I don't read a lot.
[43:59.44]I look over and read what you guys are writing a lot of times.
[44:10.59]I'll try it.
[44:24.92]Don't act like you're even paying attention.
[44:35.77]Do Chinese without the subtitles.
[44:42.93]I don't know.
[44:43.25]I don't think a predominantly North American audience will be able to follow along.
[45:01.36]Maybe, though.
[45:06.64]I'm learning Mandarin.
[45:07.46]I would like to practice.
[45:31.82]We didn't even get to the title screen.
[46:14.66]Now this is an intro.
[46:20.26]Dynasty Warriors Origins.
[46:48.00]In the second month of the Guanghe era's seventh year, a major upheaval began.
[46:53.96]By extending a hand to suffering peasants, the way of the Great Peace gained immense support.
[47:01.37]Jiang Zhao, the movement's founder, declared a rebellion against the Han Dynasty.
[47:09.30]in aid of the provinces countless adherents of the way of the great peace rose in revolt to demonstrate their unity they clad themselves in yellow and referred to themselves as the yellow turbans this would later be called the yellow turban rebellion I said weren't you alive during this and so the era was set on the path toward great turmoil
[47:34.82]Chapter one, the yellow turbines rebellion turns to a reign of terror.
[47:40.63]Heroes rise in the midst of turmoil.
[47:47.22]Two months after the yellow turbines uprising.
[48:21.14]Hey, I feel like you didn't pay attention yourself.
[48:22.44]Can you recap what just happened?
[48:26.12]Hold on.
[48:26.44]Something way more important just showed up on the screen.
[48:28.40]We have an overworld now.
[48:30.06]Sorry, I have to pay attention to this.
[48:31.20]I can't be looking over here at chat.
[48:34.56]I can't be looking over here.
[48:35.74]That's too much to pay attention to here.
[48:38.42]I'll answer your question in a string of queries that I'm going to receive.
[48:42.15]I'll answer it eventually here.
[48:45.25]I can answer that query eventually here.
[48:49.69]A few more pressing things are here, though.
[48:50.95]This is a cool overworld.
[48:55.27]I'm huge, though.
[49:05.16]I didn't know we were giants.
[49:06.24]I didn't know we were this big.
[49:07.16]A village elder.
[49:16.85]Quest.
[49:19.91]There's nothing left here anymore.
[49:23.61]Everything has been overrun by the yellow turbans.
[49:27.64]It's even more horrifying when you consider that those yellow turbans were once fellow citizens.
[49:34.70]Are you looking for an inn for travelers?
[49:37.54]If so, you should head to the city of G. I've heard that area hasn't been ransacked yet, and it seems they're gathering volunteer soldiers.
[49:49.88]Okay.
[49:50.26]Head to the city of G. Can I do anything here?
[50:02.41]Okay.
[50:17.54]County Castle Inn, Chi County, Guanyang, Commandery, Yu Province.
[50:23.68]Please repeat the whole thing you just said.
[50:51.99]It's a well, this is pressing matters too.
[50:53.89]We have some stuff that to pay attention to screen here so.
[51:02.56]Turn off the English come now.
[51:05.12]Don't be so modest.
[51:08.62]You are planning to stay here for awhile, right?
[51:12.68]If you're looking to find work as a soldier, why not consider joining the militia force?
[51:18.36]This is the governor of Yo's domain.
[51:20.74]He's always looking for skilled warriors.
[51:23.60]Why, just yesterday, a volunteer force visited his lordship... But I shouldn't be gossiping about others' affairs.
[51:31.37]That said, I am a businessman, and I like to stay informed.
[51:36.97]So, if you have any questions, just ask.
[51:44.35]Is that so?
[51:45.65]Well, the day's still young.
[51:47.35]You gotta love when the developer puts into the game the I would like to just not continue our conversation button.
[52:00.30]I love how there's a goodbye.
[52:01.72]I've had enough.
[52:04.12]But I haven't even had enough yet.
[52:05.56]We haven't even started talking.
[52:21.43]Can you make the subtitles a little bigger?
[52:22.61]Ooh.
[52:24.86]The inn acts as a base during your travels.
[52:27.04]Letters may arrive there from time to time.
[52:29.16]Okay.
[52:33.16]Reading letters allows you to learn what's going on in the world and can sometimes advance the story.
[52:40.01]You get kind of like a little... Ooh.
[52:48.48]Put that on?
[52:52.67]Brave warriors join the march.
[52:56.71]The yellow turbines sowing chaos throughout the realm are now descending upon you province.
[53:02.34]Local government forces are greatly outnumbered by the enemy.
[53:04.52]For this reason, we must recruit volunteers from among the people.
[53:07.80]All those with the courage to defend our way of life and maintain peace within the realm must heed this call at once.
[53:13.11]Okay.
[53:22.98]Okay.
[53:24.48]Battle preparations.
[53:28.82]Cool.
[53:29.04]Alright.
[53:29.54]You start with a long sword.
[53:30.52]I probably only have this.
[53:32.88]Yeah.
[53:36.33]Boost health by 3%.
[53:37.07]Okay.
[53:37.53]So where do I need to go?
[53:50.42]You province.
[54:10.94]3%.
[54:12.00]Those are good.
[54:12.60]Okay.
[54:15.56]Can we get a poll in chat?
[54:19.77]Succulent peach or succulent nectarine?
[54:23.39]I have a... And when I say succulent, I mean perfect.
[54:27.07]Your teeth just sink right through it.
[54:31.12]I know what my answer is and I would like to know everybody else.
[54:35.22]Because for me... Succulent Chinese meal.
[54:52.89]Okay.
[54:53.67]Chuckie.
[54:53.91]Here.
[55:21.50]pretty overwhelmingly peach but my vote is nectarine when you eat a perfect nectarine you are eating an awesome fruit but you're also drinking like a whole cup of juice
[55:49.51]When you bite into a nectarine that's ready, you just like drink, you take like a gulp of juice and you get to eat a fruit too at the same time.
[55:56.76]It's like the best of both worlds.
[55:57.69]It's amazing.
[56:00.99]Hey, we are part of Liu Bei's army.
[56:05.23]Of course, it's the same for peach, but nectarines are they just they taste a little better to me.
[56:10.39]I like the flavor profile a little bit better.
[56:12.37]Now they're also peaches are.
[56:14.99]They do the same thing, but I feel like a like a super good, perfectly ripe nectarine is a little bit more than a peach.
[56:26.45]I guess this is the volunteer army.
[56:31.59]What about a plum?
[56:36.83]I feel like plums are hard to get.
[56:38.17]I don't, I mean, I'm not sure I've ever seen a plum in the state of Nevada.
[56:46.66]Can I, I don't even know if I can get them.
[56:49.18]Like a nice plum?
[56:50.00]I knew it was you.
[56:55.70]I've not seen you since G, but it is good to see you doing well.
[57:06.46]Maybe I'm just not looking for it.
[57:09.86]Yeah, I just sprint right to the nectarines and I just get as many as I can put in a bag.
[57:19.03]Yes.
[57:20.81]We fought together in G-Province.
[57:29.69]Josh, that's like the second banger of the day from Josh.
[57:33.79]He said, watching you play a story-driven game is like watching a podcast, watching a movie while listening to a podcast at the same time.
[57:41.63]I'm sorry.
[57:45.47]These are my companions.
[57:48.05]We swore a vow of brotherhood with each other just recently.
[57:51.71]This is Zhang Fei.
[57:54.25]You gotta turn the music down.
[57:58.41]And this is Liu Bei, the eldest of us three.
[58:03.63]Is Lu Bu in this game?
[58:05.97]I remember Lu Bu was like the Superman of all the games.
[58:09.99]When Lu Bu showed up, he could kill you in two hits.
[58:11.93]It was horrifying.
[58:13.53]It was like the butcher showing up in Diablo 4.
[58:15.93]It was like, okay, I'm going to die in one hit.
[58:18.37]Lu Bu has like invaded my game.
[58:20.39]I'm dead if I don't run away.
[58:25.16]That's so funny.
[58:26.36]I hope that's the same thing in this game.
[58:33.94]I have heard from Guan Yu that you were a man of great valor.
[58:37.26]He's like the Terminator?
[58:38.12]Yeah.
[58:39.76]I am surprised you remember, brother.
[58:42.60]I only spoke of him but for a moment at a feast.
[58:45.85]That was more than enough.
[58:47.31]Remembering names and reputations is a skill of mine.
[58:51.17]As unimpressive as it may be.
[58:56.02]He did the arm thing Like the arm up Kind of cock the elbow 90 degrees and like grab like the back of your head Did the arm thing?
[59:23.82]We will be fighting against the Vanguard of the Yellow Turbans tomorrow, by order of the governor.
[59:30.18]Would you be interested in joining us?
[59:34.14]Absolutely.
[59:34.42]Hey, what's this about?
[59:36.58]You don't think we're enough?
[59:40.86]No, that's not it.
[59:44.10]Then why?
[59:46.40]Right from the moment we formed our volunteer army, we have welcomed any tough fighter, no matter who they may be.
[59:55.14]And from what Guan Yu told us, he made the government forces look like incompetent fools.
[59:59.79]I want to fight with him and see his skills for myself.
[60:04.45]Well, if that's your decision, alright.
[60:06.85]But first, I need to see how strong a warrior he is.
[60:12.94]So let's put you to the test.
[60:15.26]Alright, this is how you fight a boss tutorial.
[60:21.78]What if somebody gets hurt?
[60:22.62]Turn up the music.
[60:24.72]I can almost hear you speak.
[60:29.23]Turn the music down one or two notches.
[60:51.11]Hold on.
[60:51.55]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[60:52.63]Let me just turn this down.
[60:56.56]Two notches, that's it.
[61:01.00]Alright, here we go.
[61:01.54]What do you want to teach me?
[61:08.11]Oh, right.
[61:09.39]I want to do this too.
[61:14.15]Uh, can I?
[61:14.79]Okay.
[61:15.85]Evasion I want on B.
[61:20.00]Wait, what?
[61:23.01]Evasion... What's going on here?
[61:27.31]Oh, you have to swap them.
[61:28.43]Okay.
[61:29.25]I'd rather have Evasion be on B. So that, okay.
[61:33.87]Is it Musu?
[61:34.75]Musu attacks a right trigger.
[61:37.39]That's better.
[61:43.68]Yeah, that's way better.
[61:45.12]But your strikes are weak.
[61:47.08]You'll never break my guard like that.
[61:49.90]I can see right through you.
[61:52.34]Zhang Fei, don't get too carried away.
[61:55.80]Brother, Team Zhang Fei knows not to take it too far.
[61:57.88]Swords can be used for a variety of strong attacks while attacking, while blocking, after evading, or in midair.
[62:07.35]You're better than I thought.
[62:09.41]But it'll take more than that to beat me.
[62:15.57]Attack with swallow slash.
[62:21.99]Battle arts consume bravery.
[62:24.25]Bravery increases as you attack enemies.
[62:28.10]Ah, that's kind of the action points.
[62:43.22]Not bad.
[62:43.72]Cool.
[62:44.62]I like a special move.
[62:45.38]Zhang Fei, that's enough for today, don't you think?
[62:49.56]I'm just getting started, brother.
[62:53.52]I'll strike first this time.
[62:55.66]Try not to go down straight away.
[63:01.53]If you hold block, can you just hold everything?
[63:03.45]Does it matter?
[63:03.85]Or is it like, oh, if you hold it for too long, it's not going to work.
[63:06.31]And is it 100% damage block?
[63:07.83]It is.
[63:08.01]Okay.
[63:15.76]Oh, okay, there is a parry.
[63:16.94]You block the moment you are attacked, you will parry.
[63:19.00]Nice.
[63:19.46]Attacks with glowing indicators cannot be blocked or parried.
[63:22.96]Evade these attacks or use special battle arts to counter them.
[63:44.41]Ooh, they, oh my God, they made Dynasty Warriors?
[63:47.79]I tried to counter it with a special, it didn't work.
[64:04.24]Oh, it wants me to do... Okay.
[64:05.44]It wants me to do Harvey and V. You can rush.
[64:11.00]Time to attack.
[64:12.46]Time to act.
[64:27.51]What?
[64:28.37]How dare you attack me like that?
[64:30.97]What the fuck?
[64:32.72]He looks like he could go on forever.
[64:40.59]Whoa, what's going on?
[64:43.09]That's cool.
[65:04.30]Let's try parry.
[65:06.76]Should I be timing this?
[65:08.22]Is it rhythm based or is it?
[65:10.74]I don't get it.
[65:12.20]Uh, what?
[65:30.88]Oh fuck.
[65:31.52]I think it's just timed.
[65:33.48]Can you come up with your own lore for this game?
[65:37.02]Uh, I don't think I can.
[65:58.99]You just got Luigi?
[65:59.75]What?
[66:00.07]That was a scripted loss.
[66:01.07]Did you make a tier list of their eyebrows?
[66:03.14]Well, I mean Guan Yu's R.S.
[66:29.32]At this moment right now.
[66:31.64]I second my brother's request.
[66:34.04]It would be very heartening to have you on our side.
[66:38.54]I know you must have conflicted feelings after what happened in G. After all, we both have died back then without the yellow turbines help.
[66:47.82]Funny chatter.
[66:48.78]This is funny.
[66:49.50]This is not funny chatting going on today.
[66:51.48]Attacking and looting the homes of not only government officials, but even ordinary people.
[66:59.28]Only funny chatters show up to pop-up streams.
[67:33.20]Alright.
[67:35.16]We are done with the tutorial.
[67:36.66]We're done with the opening kind of cutscenes.
[67:41.23]Very interested.
[67:41.97]Battle of Guangyang.
[67:44.37]Volunteer forces versus yellow turbines.
[67:48.31]Alright, let me do a few things first.
[67:51.29]I want to... First of all, let's do this.
[68:00.03]I can't change this.
[68:02.69]Oh well, we have to.
[68:03.45]We're going to hear the English dub for a little bit while longer.
[68:09.30]Let me drop a one or two little graphic settings.
[68:15.42]Not anything crazy.
[68:21.20]How about I guess I can't really change very much.
[68:27.40]What's up, Michael?
[68:28.15]Maybe like fog turn the bloom off lens flare.
[68:34.13]Put everything to minimum.
[68:36.13]No.
[68:38.69]I think it's fine.
[68:40.87]It's not a problem for me.
[68:41.73]I don't like bloom anyways, though.
[68:44.49]Put fog down.
[68:45.41]Maybe that'll help.
[68:50.21]Alright, what's this?
[68:56.66]Unlock.
[69:01.04]Did I unlock this?
[69:01.68]What is this?
[69:04.80]A waymark for you province is now available.
[69:08.75]You can travel to unlocked waymarks via the map in the menu.
[69:13.41]Oh my God, this is huge.
[69:16.67]Holy shit.
[69:17.13]OK.
[69:26.40]It's time recommended rank level one.
[69:32.12]I'm ready.
[69:34.79]Music is a little loud still personally.
[69:40.74]China is a pretty pretty big place.
[69:43.84]It's true.
[69:49.71]It is good to have you here.
[69:54.41]So you're not one to ignore people crying out for help.
[69:57.48]Welcome to the volunteer army.
[70:09.13]Do we have to place armies?
[70:10.57]Oh no, I hope I don't have to.
[70:12.47]This is what I want to see.
[70:13.45]This is the best part about Dynasty Warriors.
[70:16.86]Is the when you get to see the map?
[70:19.44]It turns in this weird like.
[70:21.58]Top down level.
[70:22.36]It looks like like bacteria fighting each other.
[70:26.02]It's really, really cool.
[70:27.04]Alright, where should we go?
[70:31.30]As members of the volunteer army, we must drive back the yellow turbans encroaching on this territory.
[70:36.35]The enemy commander is Cheng Yuanzi.
[70:39.13]If we defeat him, victory is ours.
[70:41.05]Alright, we're going to defeat Cheng.
[70:44.61]Meanwhile, I will be the one commanding our forces, which means that if I am defeated, we will lose.
[70:52.63]I will be guarding you myself, brother.
[70:55.44]Whatever happens, I will ensure that you come home to no harm.
[71:01.71]That's what I'm counting on.
[71:03.93]Alright, with Guan Yu by my side, I can head for the enemy camp without fear.
[71:07.41]Okay.
[71:11.72]Zhang Fei, I want you... I want you to move in from the east.
[71:16.68]Hitting them from both sides will throw them off balance.
[71:21.53]I mean, my plan always in these games is WM1 straight up to the end.
[71:28.37]I know people say, dude, don't do that, but I do WM1 all the way up.
[71:33.90]I know people meticulously like, oh, I'm going to clear the entire map of everything.
[71:42.20]So can you dynamically switch between them like GTA?
[71:53.29]Are they pillaging these villages?
[71:55.09]Alright, so we're gonna go in that.
[71:59.53]I see where we need to go.
[72:02.70]Alright, let's do it.
[72:04.86]There's four major points here.
[72:06.44]Let's see if I fail the first mission of the game.
[72:08.74]Alright, do you wish to view the War Council?
[72:16.17]Alright, uh, information.
[72:18.13]Alright, here are all the, I think, generals?
[72:23.71]Most of them are concentrated up there.
[72:31.58]I don't think I have anything new.
[72:37.54]Oh, Falcon.
[72:38.20]Okay, Falcon, Flurry.
[72:39.47]Okay, I just got these.
[72:45.91]So this is the only thing that can stop the kind of generals, right?
[72:52.11]Let's go.
[72:52.37]I'm ready.
[72:58.34]Soon it will be time to march.
[73:00.56]Why, brother?
[73:01.64]Are you feeling anxious?
[73:03.52]Scared even?
[73:04.48]Hey, my brother just got engaged.
[73:06.74]You wish them luck?
[73:08.12]Good luck on the engagement.
[73:12.76]Quite the opposite.
[73:15.04]I'm thrilled that it is finally beginning.
[73:27.28]We are about to win our first victory, my brothers.
[73:30.72]I mean, how can we not with such formidable allies?
[73:35.95]Well spoken.
[73:39.73]This is the Liu Bei we vowed to follow.
[73:43.69]Now, let the heavens witness our might.
[73:47.10]Alright, let's all get out of here.
[73:56.55]Alright, yeah, now I can see the map.
[73:57.99]Let's go.
[73:59.07]I better not catch you slacking.
[74:07.30]Was it one guy or is it music a little too loud?
[74:12.80]Was that one guy?
[74:19.96]It's OK, it's fine.
[74:22.66]I'll put it on 7.
[74:30.18]What just happened?
[74:30.74]I thought like they exploded.
[74:33.10]Crap.
[74:39.63]Crap.
[74:52.32]juggle juggle juggle not the enemy officer enemies who have lost all fortitude and are staggered can be hit with an assault assault inflicts heavy damage making them good okay cool momentum well that guy's right through their race from behind starts the event yan zhang is now advancing towards the exam towards zhang okay
[75:22.00]Is there a better way to see the... I want to see the close-up map.
[75:24.34]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[75:26.46]How do I see the more close-up map?
[75:28.54]Pushing back.
[75:51.12]Okay.
[75:51.40]How do I do it?
[75:52.43]How do I do it on the controller?
[76:12.09]As you proficiently increase his new battle arts.
[76:14.21]Oh, so this is a sword.
[76:15.07]Bottom D-pad?
[76:17.59]Oh, okay.
[76:25.37]There's like a general I gotta get rid of, right?
[76:30.18]Meat buns replenish health.
[76:31.70]You can carry multiple meat buns.
[76:33.70]I think I just used one.
[76:35.69]Yeah.
[76:37.15]Meat buns can be found inside pots and bases.
[76:39.96]If you ever need to heal yourself, it's best to find... Yeah, just pots and stuff.
[76:45.68]I'm going... Ah, left or right.
[76:46.80]I'm going to go straight up this way.
[76:49.62]Oh, it's on auto-use, right.
[76:51.04]Oh, shit.
[77:01.71]Two people?
[77:02.35]Alright, let me get a good carry here.
[77:15.91]Shit, I missed.
[77:20.58]Am I parrying that?
[77:29.72]Pressing right trigger... Okay, yeah.
[77:31.88]I don't want to use that right now.
[77:36.67]Oop, I just got a longsword.
[77:46.26]Defeated officers sometimes drop weapons.
[77:51.23]You can immediately equip weapons you pick up.
[77:53.71]Oh god no.
[77:56.51]Okay, everything's pretty clear.
[78:08.86]I kind of just destroyed this first mission I think.
[78:20.32]It's... It's... It's... It's... Lu Bu!
[78:22.68]What is that move?
[78:23.44]This guy's attacking with a win.
[78:26.26]Looking rough.
[78:47.64]Keep him up there.
[78:53.98]Oh, shit.
[78:54.37]I'm too far away.
[78:54.97]Is that guy like a buffer?
[78:59.43]Onward!
[79:07.28]The volunteer soldiers are now advancing towards the yellow turbines headquarters.
[79:11.36]I have I'm going to use it in here and this is going to be I'm going to kill.
[79:16.41]It's going to be amazing miscreants.
[79:18.55]I've had enough of them.
[79:22.96]got a pre-roll by the way in case you're still trying that I think it's been more than an hour but I'm I'm not gonna run any ads right now thank you for the uh experiment uh feedback I should actually really uh forces with high courage excel in both offense and defense officers with high courage also that was loud how loud was that
[79:56.39]We literally can't hear you.
[79:59.79]What?
[80:02.83]You're just talking.
[80:03.67]It's just silence and just like kind of voices.
[80:06.51]You're too quiet.
[80:07.61]OK, let me turn this down then.
[80:13.61]There that should be better.
[80:20.74]Yep.
[80:21.72]Uh-huh.
[80:22.06]Soldiers of high courage will perform group attacks using tactics, much like the attacks with glowing indicators performed by enemy officers.
[80:28.38]Attacks using tactics cannot be blocked and can only be stopped with special arts.
[80:33.08]Oh, shit.
[80:33.50]Alright, let's go.
[80:39.46]I'm going to do the best technique.
[80:40.84]This is the best Dynasty Warriors technique that you can do.
[80:43.62]It's get Musu and just get every single person to aggro on top of you and then do this.
[80:55.95]What is he doing?
[81:00.11]Stop!
[81:05.64]What?
[81:05.78]Who's this guy?
[81:07.06]Why am I locked onto this guy?
[81:11.84]I gotta fall back, fall back, fall back.
[81:13.10]Run away, run away.
[81:16.86]You have to clear out enemies and stuff.
[81:18.33]You can't just go in like that.
[81:19.37]The soldiers are not impressive on their own.
[81:21.27]But their combined effort must not be underestimated.
[81:25.46]They have a lot of officers here.
[81:32.63]Holy shit, there's like too many people here.
[81:34.51]Alright, watch out for the guy with the big hammer.
[81:55.40]What I missed?
[82:07.68]Walk it.
[82:08.04]Alright, drop something good so I can maybe heal.
[82:17.92]I need to heal quick quick quick.
[82:18.78]Alright, your death animation is taking way too long.
[82:31.73]Can't dodge that.
[82:35.53]Shit.
[82:41.92]Fuck, I tried to parry it.
[82:50.20]Yeah!
[82:50.70]I don't know whose side the heavens are on.
[82:55.63]But I do know that I will go to the aid of any who cry out for help.
[83:05.25]It's as simple as that.
[83:09.55]Is it just spam?
[83:11.29]I think it's spam.
[83:12.39]This one.
[83:13.73]Wait, wait, maybe don't kill him yet.
[83:14.67]This is other officers, right?
[83:24.82]Did he just say g'day?
[83:26.60]That's Juju.
[83:27.10]Alright, I got a new weapon.
[83:28.74]Hmm.
[83:53.75]impressive work thank you once again for joining us you can turn off the pauses that happen when forces move that's thank you so much for telling me that because I was like I don't want that on rank two sword I'm gonna become obsessed with this game okay
[84:30.83]I got was a skill point.
[84:36.46]Additional special attacks.
[84:39.48]Every time you proficiency increases, you'll also gain a rank level.
[84:44.32]Each rank level gained increases your health, attack and defense.
[84:48.28]Oh cool.
[84:55.19]So plus 12 health, 4 attack, 6 defense.
[85:00.96]Thank you again, all of you.
[85:25.03]Today we won a great victory.
[85:27.13]An auspicious beginning for our volunteer army.
[85:29.63]You're playing this game like Elden Ring.
[85:32.65]I would like to rest.
[85:35.63]It's fine.
[85:37.45]That was a good first little taste mission.
[85:41.27]Indeed.
[85:42.33]Duty first, then we'll raise our cups in celebration.
[85:45.96]I'll go to the castle.
[85:48.50]You head back to the road and I'll catch up with you.
[85:51.60]There is no more work to be done.
[85:54.44]Spend your time as you will.
[86:00.59]Feel free to return to your end.
[86:02.49]Hello, Raiders.
[86:04.67]Did I miss a raid?
[86:05.45]Well, thanks.
[86:06.69]Welcome.
[86:07.97]Welcome, Raiders.
[86:09.57]Who raided?
[86:12.10]Journey?
[86:14.12]Well, thanks, Journey.
[86:19.92]If you have nothing to attend to, come see me later.
[86:24.02]Someone just said he literally doesn't care.
[86:25.94]What are you talking... It's like a nice thing to do and it's cool.
[86:36.05]Hi, welcome everybody.
[86:37.01]Don't listen to that person.
[86:42.97]Ooh.
[86:43.09]Okay.
[86:55.53]I have a new sword.
[87:04.21]Right?
[87:08.72]OK.
[87:14.52]So we gotta go there.
[87:43.47]Guardian of peace.
[87:48.67]It seems there is still hair of the curse.
[87:53.64]That itself is proof that the turmoil across the land has been eliminated.
[88:01.64]Although it is still, what was the last Dynasty Warriors game to come out?
[88:05.65]That light represents the hopes of the people.
[88:11.55]Hope provides people with the will to live.
[88:15.91]And with that determination, they can change the world.
[88:22.71]Eventually, this cycle will guide the realm toward peace.
[88:28.88]I believe this is also connected to your forgotten past.
[88:33.86]That is the very reason why you were entrusted with bringing about an age of peace.
[88:41.70]I like Kefir.
[88:45.47]I'm a Kefir Andy.
[88:47.41]This is a huge step up for the series.
[88:50.97]I don't even know what the last one I really, maybe 8?
[89:01.82]Is the last one I actually played?
[89:15.09]Ah, I didn't know you had returned.
[89:23.72]That's the last good one.
[89:24.76]When did it come out?
[89:25.36]Like 2012?
[89:25.50]2013 or something?
[89:25.90]2015?
[89:25.92]I suppose you must be tired.
[89:37.78]Yeah, 2013.
[89:38.00]Yeah, the Zelda spin-offs too.
[89:39.72]The Hyrule Warriors.
[89:40.44]I never played either one of those.
[89:41.62]People seem to like them though.
[90:15.20]individual but now I wish to hit myself for being so hasty in my assessment I saw you throw the enemy officer who had be cornered right into the air and skip through the battlefield from one end to the other to help my comrades
[90:28.94]At that moment, I realized what an incredible officer you will become and how your renown will grow amid these dark times.
[90:36.16]This is a gift, a small token of gratitude from this unnamed soldier.
[90:41.17]I hope you will make use of it.
[90:44.35]Oh shit, 500 bucks.
[90:47.93]Okay, cool.
[90:51.58]I got a new weapon.
[90:52.98]I got long sword two.
[90:59.16]Can I throw away longsword one or salvage longsword one?
[91:13.89]What does this one do?
[91:15.37]Okay, it's just strong.
[91:21.19]And you have to be close for this one.
[91:22.25]You can't be that far away.
[91:31.85]Okay.
[91:34.37]Okay, I'm ready.
[91:55.61]Put a blindfold on and you probably still win.
[92:00.18]No way.
[92:01.54]Not me.
[92:02.16]Maybe some other people.
[92:03.30]Not me though.
[92:03.96]Oops.
[92:26.24]I cast a sneeze curse on you, sorry.
[92:31.37]I have a pendant on that blocks all kind of like allergy-based curses, so I'm glad I put that one on today.
[92:44.15]Usually I have the.
[92:47.79]The last few months I've had on like the ring of decent bowel movements.
[92:52.32]So that doesn't been pretty regular.
[92:53.86]It's been pretty good so far.
[92:55.04]I don't really want to take that ring off.
[92:57.22]But the pendant is some haven't really sneezed either, so it's good.
[93:01.96]That's not what I meant.
[93:06.46]Guan Yu is just so damn impressive.
[93:10.30]His look, his voice.
[93:12.50]He seems like a big deal.
[93:15.52]You know, the three of us haven't actually been together that long.
[93:19.85]We met next to a recruitment poster when they were looking for people to hunt the yellow turbans.
[93:25.11]And we got talking.
[93:28.13]My peach trees happen to be in bloom, so I invited them over for a drink under them.
[93:34.63]my nectarine tree what a time that was we chatted a lot that was when we became brothers we may not have been born together but I knew then I had found my family to tell the truth we've really only just gotten started I have to work hard to prove myself to my brothers
[94:05.00]Five more streams till dog boy costume.
[94:31.22]I I think you just like missed like that was like the wrong.
[94:34.24]I am that was like the wrong dm You said that was somewhere else.
[94:38.36]I don't know what other stream you were on But you have like probably three or four windows open at the you're on the wrong one But I think your intentions are good Maybe we can keep fighting the good fight together.
[94:53.27]Don't take it the wrong way
[95:02.65]It was just my honest opinion.
[95:07.85]You said you would do a dog cosplay last time you streamed.
[95:10.35]You were really drunk.
[95:12.39]You've got some nerve talking to me like that.
[95:17.04]No, I don't drink more like I haven't.
[95:21.32]The last time I drank more than like three or four drinks on stream.
[95:25.56]I told you guys I was going to do my own convention.
[95:29.68]What the fuck am I talking about?
[95:33.56]I don't drink more than three or four drinks on stream anymore.
[95:37.15]It's been a very long time since I've had one on stream.
[95:41.27]But when we cross like three drinks on stream,
[95:49.66]I'm gonna do a convention and we're gonna um I'm gonna everyone you're gonna have like arcade machines Okay, bro Yeah, I'm gonna have a convention.
[95:58.95]It's gonna be like a bunch of arcade machines Hi
[96:17.83]And get some new weapons.
[96:25.25]Cool.
[96:29.54]So, locations in the city.
[96:31.16]There are weapon shops, inns, and other locations.
[96:38.67]Just go in here.
[96:39.37]Equip a new weapon and speak to Zhang Fei.
[96:47.94]Each weapon has its own attack power and weapon trait.
[96:49.78]Ooh, a spear.
[96:51.50]Consider the attack power and traits when deciding which weapon is right for you.
[96:55.29]800 bucks.
[97:00.67]Should I buy this or should I hold it?
[97:07.73]Why do you still say IM instead of DM?
[97:09.51]Because I'm 40.
[97:19.48]I'll try it.
[97:26.83]Spears are easy to use and have a wide attack range.
[97:29.45]Broad sweeps, rapid thrusts, all out strikes, and a plethora of other powerful attacks make them versatile weapons on the battlefield.
[97:44.96]You can use various types of weapons.
[97:46.38]Your proficiency with new weapon types will start out low, but will increase.
[97:52.05]Get you better rank level.
[97:53.47]So you really want to level up pretty much as much as you can, right?
[98:00.82]So you really want to spread out where you are.
[98:02.32]Cool.
[98:13.14]You can test weapons in the virtual battlefield.
[98:18.35]That's cool.
[98:26.73]It's endless.
[98:29.51]Okay.
[98:31.47]So this is a spear.
[98:32.89]Okay.
[98:45.93]Oh, damn.
[98:47.03]That's cool.
[98:51.33]Wild Rush.
[98:52.21]How does this work?
[98:54.70]I can't believe this.
[98:58.08]The enemy officer has been defeated.
[99:00.92]I can see it all.
[99:02.08]Alright, spear is actually kind of fun.
[99:10.54]Whoa.
[99:10.92]What's next?
[99:13.14]Wait, what's the... I need to... I gotta read those.
[99:16.34]Okay.
[99:18.30]X, X, X, X is a four-hit normal combo.
[99:20.64]Y, Y, Y. Combo floating through flurry.
[99:24.50]X into... Hold Y during a normal X combo.
[99:27.74]Okay.
[99:28.26]What about those moves I have?
[99:29.78]There we go.
[99:37.62]Okay.
[99:38.76]Take a parrying stance.
[99:40.06]If attacked... Oh, it's a parry.
[99:48.05]Rust your spear while charging forward.
[99:50.07]When performed in mid-air, you will rush toward the ground.
[99:52.24]Alright, so this is a parry and this is like a jump in the air and do it.
[100:06.22]That is cool.
[100:06.88]Alright, that's a huge window too.
[100:08.38]That's enormous.
[100:13.60]It is a little slower though.
[100:14.96]Alright, let me get out of here.
[100:43.03]No.
[100:48.95]Got some time to kill.
[100:49.83]You can have some fun with those.
[100:59.41]Skirmishes are small scale battles against enemy remnants and bandits.
[101:03.31]Unlike larger battles, these can be concluded in a short period of time.
[101:07.71]Skirmishes make for great practice and defeating the enemies also restores peace to the area.
[101:13.28]It's kind of like a side quest.
[101:17.80]What should I do?
[101:21.78]Rank level two.
[101:22.63]What about this one?
[101:30.21]I'll do this one.
[101:31.01]On the bridge.
[101:39.06]Smoke cigarettes instead of drinking?
[101:41.14]Uh, no.
[101:44.04]already an officer alright I did not read what that just said but I hope it wasn't important
[102:13.71]Don't hit me!
[102:19.42]Whoa, it just took my block on away.
[102:31.18]Do I have any... I don't think I have any troops.
[102:47.11]Oh, I gotta do proficiency.
[102:55.27]Hit me!
[102:55.62]Oh shit, okay.
[102:57.04]Shit!
[102:57.20]Stay sharp.
[103:02.60]I've been waiting for this.
[103:17.82]No!
[103:18.84]Am I gonna kill?
[103:32.73]Oh, he's killed in one hit!
[103:35.85]Holy shit, he died instantly.
[103:37.45]That's crazy.
[103:50.63]Alright, spear is kind of good, but I do like the sword better.
[103:56.65]Shit.
[104:01.83]I like the sword better.
[104:10.09]I did just get a new spear though.
[104:16.20]Is this all I'm going to play today?
[104:17.42]Probably.
[104:20.65]Like I said, I got up this morning and I was like, wait, this game came out.
[104:22.97]I was like, wait.
[104:24.07]I can just turn my stream on too.
[104:29.47]Okay, now this is actually way better.
[104:30.85]Because it has an actual big finisher at the end.
[104:34.61]I'll try it.
[104:46.59]Unlock new skill panels.
[104:54.57]Skill points acquired.
[104:56.86]Wait, there's more skills?
[105:00.10]Oh God.
[105:00.64]OK.
[105:06.38]Typically I would say, oh, we're getting a big drip feed here.
[105:09.85]Get me into the game.
[105:11.45]But there's a lot of things trickling in here, so I'm happy with the pacing so far.
[105:20.71]OK.
[105:26.21]I mean, I'm going to pick damage every time.
[105:27.41]I just am.
[105:36.94]Evade repeatedly.
[105:38.50]30 skill points?
[105:41.90]How many?
[105:42.32]Oh, these are... Okay, it's not just one.
[106:00.68]How can we say every sentence like you're drowning in quicksand?
[106:04.86]Uh... What?
[106:20.70]Boost damage to soldier by 8%.
[106:21.72]This is just better.
[106:36.28]I need a new outfit.
[106:37.12]I do need a new outfit.
[106:37.95]Alright, let me actually do this combo now.
[106:46.47]Yeah, that finisher with the thrust is so much better.
[107:03.58]Alright, get rid of all the putties first.
[107:06.52]And then the officer.
[107:23.65]What the fuck?
[107:26.63]What's next?
[107:39.83]Alright, I might put that on right trigger instead of right bumper.
[107:48.40]Oh shit, I just beat it.
[107:49.22]Ooh, new sword.
[108:10.35]Can somebody please confirm that I did in fact spend $60 on the Family Guy game?
[108:14.81]I can confirm that.
[108:15.79]Why do you need to?
[108:16.73]You can ask the source directly.
[108:18.17]Me.
[108:18.79]Yes, I did.
[108:19.27]And no, it was $75, not $60.
[108:20.31]It was more.
[108:20.59]Defense.
[108:20.87]Defense.
[108:37.47]Why was it so much?
[108:39.45]It wasn't so much.
[108:40.37]It just I kept buying like the little coin packs like that.
[108:43.57]It was like, oh, like 10 sacks of coins for $5.
[108:48.48]I don't know.
[108:49.08]I don't know what the fuck I was doing.
[108:50.56]This is like 10 years ago.
[108:51.62]This is 10 years ago.
[109:06.78]you spend you spend uh 75 dollars in a Family Guy mobile game in 2012 and all of a sudden everybody's coming like everybody wants to come after me which now it's more like 300 now from like inflation brother welcome back he was impressed by our success
[109:31.31]and disordered us to go to the aid of government forces.
[109:34.60]You were 30?
[109:35.08]What does that matter?
[109:36.38]Yes, yes.
[109:36.72]And what else?
[109:37.20]Hmm?
[109:53.19]You did that at 30 years old.
[109:54.77]I was enjoying my time in Family Guy, I believe it was called The Quest for Stuff.
[110:21.18]we do not fight for gold or rewards what an embarrassing credit card statement yes guanyu is right hey whatever I I I enjoyed my time in in that game and I I don't play it anymore but whatever I bought 75 dollars worth of coins like Peter tokens whatever the hell they were think on its junk fake
[110:48.38]Hey, how much money... I screamed this at you last time.
[110:53.29]I screamed it at you last time.
[110:54.41]How much money did you spend opening Hearthstone packs?
[111:01.33]Hey, how much was that knife in Counter-Strike?
[111:07.46]We are turning our talk, our dreams, into reality.
[111:11.86]Doesn't that fill your heart with fire?
[111:22.66]How much did you spend on Hearthstone?
[111:24.24]I don't think very much.
[111:25.12]We're not guilty for your crime.
[111:58.81]I've spent around a hundred pounds on skins and stuff in League of Legends.
[112:03.55]And regret almost all of it.
[112:05.05]Oh no.
[112:05.87]What about TF2?
[112:08.09]Now that's probably quite a bit.
[112:29.12]You gotta remember, TF2 was my favorite game pretty much ever.
[112:33.15]And I played it every single day, and I was super into the marketplace and trading and buying keys.
[112:40.45]I was so into it.
[112:41.51]I was.
[112:42.03]I don't have no idea.
[112:47.58]That game was my whole life for five, six, seven straight years.
[112:53.24]I played it for at least three to five hours, or two or three hours at least, every single day.
[113:00.91]Our role is to eliminate those who would sow chaos.
[113:06.64]I spent 600 plus dollars on Candy Crush once by accident.
[113:12.04]By accident?
[113:12.66]You don't remember even that?
[113:14.88]And yet?
[113:17.74]If you are really so intent on defeating Zhang Jiao, maybe you are still one of us.
[113:23.46]With or without your memories.
[113:28.04]I can see your eyes haven't changed at all.
[113:36.15]And if you truly have not changed, then you may one day remember who you were.
[113:45.21]But until that day comes, you must survive.
[113:47.99]Did he just keep using power-ups with auto-line to his credit card?
[113:57.99]Yeah, once you, okay, let's be careful.
[113:59.63]You got to, don't sit, don't, okay, tell like the app store, like don't save my payment.
[114:05.94]Like, oh, hey, do you want to log in each time you buy something?
[114:10.46]That's how you get yourself in trouble.
[114:12.58]The act of typing your password in to buy something is like enough of a deterrent to not just be like, yeah, I guess I'll get another 10 coin sacks.
[114:24.21]Why not?
[114:26.65]Live to see your task through.
[114:29.87]I will watch over you until then.
[114:33.75]The great sage Yang Zhao, you wish to stop him, do you not?
[114:38.81]I did that, but now I just, I have my whole credit card memorized.
[114:44.96]Well, I don't know what to tell you.
[114:46.42]The yellow turbans who rose up for peace have now become the very calamity that plagues the people.
[114:56.87]and this calamity will continue to affect them until it is eliminated.
[115:02.17]So, I have come with advice.
[115:05.08]They say that the Yellow Turbans use magic from the heavens, but their magic is nothing but an illusion.
[115:13.50]They simply burn incense nearby to cause hallucinations.
[115:18.66]Your eyes alone can see through their trickery.
[115:23.72]Watch how the wind flows.
[115:26.37]It is an ability that only you possess.
[115:33.45]I must go.
[115:35.19]But we will meet again.
[115:36.38]You guys are fucking crazy today.
[116:00.49]In a chill way, in a chill way.
[116:02.17]Remember, this is a chill stream.
[116:04.41]We're just playing Dynasty Warriors.
[116:06.89]Will you fucking relax?
[116:18.09]Ooh.
[116:23.35]Is that some kind of currency there?
[116:28.81]My back's killing me.
[116:31.21]I wonder if there's a good I gotta get all these.
[116:39.62]Am I going to be an absolute weirdo and just do every single thing?
[116:43.20]And I kind of want to.
[116:45.14]This game is kind of grabbing me.
[117:07.70]Oh shit, that's cool.
[117:17.57]Someone's going to hit me.
[117:27.30]Come on, do something.
[117:38.03]That guy didn't even get to attack.
[117:42.01]I probably shouldn't have done that.
[117:46.55]Alright, there's definitely something here where don't do that.
[117:49.55]Get a bunch of experience first.
[117:50.63]Maybe I shouldn't kill the officers first.
[117:56.44]Does that matter?
[118:12.47]I just like walked over their house.
[118:30.79]I have to go across.
[118:32.59]Is there other ways to get over there?
[118:34.71]That's so funny.
[118:56.57]I heard the family in the house there just had a child.
[118:59.49]We hang the city.
[119:01.35]Ooh, I can sell.
[119:02.99]Alright, uh, backseat backseaters in the chat room.
[119:07.58]Please help me.
[119:08.42]Please give me.
[119:12.48]Do I need to hold on to any of these or just get rid of everything?
[119:15.10]That's not the best longsword.
[119:21.83]Tell everything OK.
[119:34.84]Longsword EX 3000.
[119:36.44]Wait, how much is the other one worth?
[119:40.54]40, that's it?
[119:51.93]Oh well.
[119:54.21]What do you do with the N again?
[119:55.25]Oh right, these letters.
[120:01.69]Take these.
[120:05.34]You weren't in your room, so I'm leaving you this letter.
[120:07.42]Take these off my hands while you can use them to refine gems.
[120:10.14]Okay.
[120:15.09]An old jeweler lives near my house and his age is catching up to him.
[120:18.53]So he's hanging up his precious tools for good.
[120:21.43]He came to me to see if I knew anyone worthy of inheriting them.
[120:24.98]I figured someone as handy as you would be able to get the most out of them.
[120:37.47]Ohhhh.
[120:43.90]One Pyroxene can be used to create one gem.
[120:48.30]There are five possible types of gems.
[120:55.03]What is it?
[120:55.67]Should I do this?
[121:00.15]What'd I get?
[121:04.51]Vortex Gem.
[121:11.09]It's the accessory.
[121:20.44]Should I save these?
[121:21.26]Maybe I should buy... I'll do one more.
[121:25.68]Oblivion.
[121:28.32]Ooh.
[121:31.46]What if I use two at the same time?
[121:40.30]So you open up this little... That's cool.
[121:44.39]Alright.
[121:48.17]There's a lot of shit in this game.
[121:51.97]Thank you.
[121:52.80]Here's a chest.
[121:55.48]Great bird's wing.
[121:56.48]10% health.
[121:56.80]Oh my god.
[122:11.75]Should I just sell this then?
[122:27.23]That's pretty good.
[122:27.75]10% more range.
[122:39.08]What's your favorite all-time game to stream?
[122:46.79]Um, I feel like I've had a lot of fun on a lot of things and I don't think I could ever actually do that.
[123:00.86]It's funny, there's been things probably over the years that I thought were going to be really cool, and I was super excited to do it, and I was like, that actually kind of sucked.
[123:08.48]But I wasn't, eh.
[123:10.26]And then there are things that I just played just for no reason, that I didn't even think about, that I didn't even look into before.
[123:16.03]That turned out to be one of the kind of more fun things I think I've ever done.
[123:19.01]Alright, back to sword.
[123:29.63]Nice.
[123:29.91]Looking rough.
[124:00.81]What is the favorite combo for the sword?
[124:02.73]Alright.
[124:19.93]Why did they not walk?
[124:24.69]That was weird, that should have staggered him, didn't it?
[124:49.48]Oh shit, that hurt.
[125:01.14]Please, play anything.
[125:02.66]Just scream.
[125:05.46]I'm here right now.
[125:13.26]Ha ha ha ha!
[125:15.95]Hey, I'm still on the seven hour Red Hulk ad.
[125:18.83]Oh, so you yeah, sorry.
[125:21.73]Unfortunately, I think I think maybe three of you got the 10 hour ad.
[125:28.18]Sorry about that.
[125:29.88]We got like 6-7 hours left.
[125:39.87]While evading you can do.
[125:41.41]Oh, that's pretty useful.
[125:51.36]Oh, that's another, that's a bigger combo.
[125:52.76]Bucket list is a poker stream.
[126:03.55]Yeah.
[126:11.51]Maybe.
[126:11.71]Alright, unleash a swinging kick with blinding speed.
[126:15.83]During the approach, you will disappear and be invulnerable.
[126:19.65]Another dash.
[126:22.86]20 points, okay.
[126:31.66]Peace has risen.
[126:32.51]How much money do I have?
[126:35.37]23.
[126:35.39]Ooh, I can make more gems.
[126:36.55]What the hell is that?
[126:37.31]Old coin?
[127:01.03]I think I'm ready for a big boy fight.
[127:30.20]No Balatro- Yeah, I love Balatro.
[127:32.04]It's like one of my favorite games.
[127:34.82]But that's one of those I cannot have any other chefs in the kitchen.
[127:37.62]The heavens are on our side!
[127:39.94]That which the Han stole from us shall be ours once more!
[127:48.68]Ha!
[127:56.28]I thought you were on our side.
[127:59.27]We are, as long as you pay us.
[128:06.07]Move!
[128:07.19]Hey, this way!
[128:09.11]Damn.
[128:12.10]Get off my shovel!
[128:13.44]Silas!
[128:20.06]Who is the most popular character in my universe?
[128:26.56]this just won't do when a person has the power to defy my universe like this is simply human nature that's Bugleberry that's why the law must be applied to all equally and all criminals must be punished now's no time for a lesson what are your orders tal tal
[128:57.90]Yeah, okay, what if I stream in like the summer and I just get really badly sunburned and I'm just red Jeremy?
[129:03.60]And I'm just angry at that stream.
[129:05.23]I just, I smash my desk a bunch.
[129:31.29]I know you.
[129:33.27]You were the ones who subdued the yellow turbines in Yo.
[129:37.99]Just just wait till I do the stream where I get prosthetics on my chin.
[129:43.84]Just enough.
[129:44.88]It's I'm talking like one or two centimeters longer than my chin is right now.
[129:51.32]And have a face cam on and it's going to be so not noticeable, but maybe two or three of you.
[129:55.40]I think you're going to go crazy.
[129:56.44]You would think you're going crazy.
[129:58.60]That's the whole point.
[130:00.08]Yes.
[130:05.82]What is your name?
[130:08.22]Where are you from?
[130:10.16]The eyebrows?
[130:10.97]Oh, I forgot about that.
[130:11.81]That's true.
[130:15.91]That was fucked up.
[130:18.05]I could not keep that in.
[130:22.15]Liu Bei.
[130:23.81]I do not know that name.
[130:26.09]Your position?
[130:29.78]I have none.
[130:32.08]I work to provide help to those who need my services.
[130:36.24]Yeah, because on that stream, I didn't really know what I looked like until I looked over because chat and the preview monitor for what's on the stream usually are pretty close to each other.
[130:58.57]So I looked over here and I just saw what my face looked like and what the eyebrows looked like.
[131:05.39]And it was impossible.
[131:06.49]It just looks so bizarre.
[131:09.99]Thank you for your kind words.
[131:12.35]However, ours is a ragged crew.
[131:16.09]It is natural for you to doubt us.
[131:19.55]However, if you were to give us one chance, here and now, to prove our worth.
[131:29.81]Let this ragged band of volunteers show that we can be of service.
[131:35.23]To the mighty hen.
[131:39.43]Bold words.
[131:46.27]Perhaps it is only bluster.
[131:49.41]But I see no reason not to give them a chance.
[131:54.33]They could become a valuable asset.
[131:59.20]You will serve under Cao Cao and fight together in the vanguard.
[132:06.33]South-South is in every game.
[132:11.23]You can choose.
[132:13.26]In the old Dynasty Warriors, you could pick between three or four different kingdoms.
[132:16.72]You still do.
[132:42.44]My lord, you have returned.
[132:44.78]So, is the meeting over?
[132:47.26]Who are these people?
[132:49.50]I don't recognize them.
[132:50.82]Who's this?
[132:51.68]They're a volunteer force, said to have crushed the Yellow Turbans in Yell Province.
[132:56.64]They will be under my command in the coming battle.
[132:58.85]You're not wearing team colors?
[133:00.85]That's actually kind of true.
[133:02.63]Oh?
[133:04.71]Allow me to officially introduce myself.
[133:07.43]My name is Tsao Tsao.
[133:09.41]I look forward to seeing what you're capable of in combat.
[133:15.52]sir so I take it you're a lot more capable than the government forces I am sha ho yuen we welcome anyone who is here to help our lord okay isn't that right cousin shahodun you would do well to remember that if we're to fight together
[133:43.26]Thank you for your words of welcome.
[133:44.92]Skincare routine of all these men.
[133:48.69]I tell you the best advice I could ever give anybody is moisturize when you get out of the shower.
[133:54.03]Way too many of you.
[133:56.07]Are getting out of the shower.
[133:58.29]You drying your face.
[134:00.72]And you're not doing anything else.
[134:02.88]You've got to add a moisturizer once you're dry out of the shower.
[134:08.64]It's true.
[134:09.26]No, you can say shut up mom all you want.
[134:11.18]That's fine.
[134:13.83]They seem like more reasonable people than the ones earlier.
[134:22.08]It would be wrong to think that all government forces are the same.
[134:25.90]Some among them are said to be more brutal than the Yellow Turbans.
[134:35.32]Indeed.
[134:36.50]And those are Cao Cao's true enemies.
[134:45.27]The battle against the Yellow Turbans will also aid us in removing corruption from the government.
[134:51.70]Yeah, you have to... You're gonna do moisturizer on your face, your cheeks, your forehead, your nose, whatever.
[134:57.39]Go down your chin and take it down your neck.
[134:59.69]Smear it down there.
[135:02.75]And don't use a lot.
[135:06.03]People that don't like using moisturizer out of the shower, they're always complaining, like, oh, it's so greasy.
[135:11.74]That's because you're getting like a glob of it in your hands and you're smushing and smearing it all over your face.
[135:17.44]You just need like a little... Like a...
[135:22.16]Like a dime, like just like a dime amount.
[135:25.50]How direct?
[135:26.98]Well, it won't take you long working under Cao Cao to realize what I said is true.
[135:31.87]Xiaodun, enough.
[135:34.33]Yeah, the Belief Aqua Bomb is the best moisturizer on Earth.
[135:39.73]It's expensive.
[135:41.15]It is expensive.
[135:42.87]But it lasts a long time if you use it sparingly.
[135:49.46]I've used that every single day for almost 10 straight years.
[135:52.32]I'm not fucking around.
[135:53.16]I mean it.
[135:55.22]Men who behave like beasts must be punished.
[135:58.67]That's all that matters.
[136:05.38]Yeah, one container can go a pretty long way.
[136:07.48]Belief Aqua Bomb with motivational music in the background.
[136:43.83]hey you I didn't catch your name hmm I'll remember you we're done here show me Jerma yeah sure
[137:11.62]Okay, I am going to go pee.
[137:13.94]I want to get another coffee too.
[137:14.90]I'll be right back.
[137:23.88]And we will keep playing.
[137:32.28]Yeah, we will run ads on the BRB.
[137:36.68]I will give you a countdown in case you would like it.
[137:43.85]I promise by the next stream, all the BRB shit will be back to where it's supposed to be.
[137:47.76]You're not going to get this again after today.
[137:51.86]Alright.
[137:54.46]I'll be back in like three to five minutes.
[137:58.06]Ads are incoming.
[137:59.00]I will see you guys in a few minutes.
[139:43.56]Thank you.
[142:32.20]I'm back.
[142:32.60]Are we good where no one's getting no ads, right?
[142:36.62]I believe so.
[142:39.68]OK, let's do it.
[143:02.41]Did you moisturize?
[143:08.09]How much would history change if you were sent back to ancient China with a laptop full of your streams?
[143:14.76]I would... I would probably die on the way there.
[143:19.96]I would probably like fall down a mountain or something.
[143:37.27]I would like trip on the first rock and fly forward very quickly and my face would just get fucking caved in by the wall.
[143:45.14]By like the rock wall.
[143:46.78]It would happen within the first 10 seconds of me starting this expedition.
[143:52.00]It would be just a face plant into a rock mountain kind of wall.
[143:55.98]Directly face, nose, everything would just cave in.
[143:58.59]I'd be gone.
[144:08.99]Hey.
[144:13.39]That was very graphic.
[144:16.47]Yes.
[144:18.13]Alright, let's do it.
[144:21.71]Yes.
[144:21.91]I think I'm good to go.
[144:33.16]Now go.
[144:40.23]We would probably have flying cars because of that.
[144:45.52]No, I think... I think it would have been like a Dark Ages 2.
[144:56.75]Well, one before the original Dark Ages.
[144:59.89]Or after it.
[145:03.83]This is what that person was talking about, right?
[145:07.05]Yeah.
[145:07.78]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[145:10.25]I don't want any of it.
[145:13.32]Alright, let's go.
[145:15.08]I'm going to go left side.
[145:20.62]Battle areas with active fighting are shown in blue if allies are winning and red if they are losing.
[145:28.85]show these hans scum that their villainy will not go unpunished when enemy and ally forces clash the location is a battle area oh we can we're gonna get a battering round I shall hunt you down this area is ours now
[145:58.43]What's the new combo?
[145:59.35]I don't have it yet.
[146:04.44]Damn it.
[146:05.86]There are more of them than I expected.
[146:08.96]We've only hit a couple villages so far.
[146:11.20]Now is the time to pray.
[146:15.49]Ask the heavens to help us rid the land of these dogs.
[146:20.73]You never thought you'd see me playing Dynasty Warriors?
[146:24.90]The yellow tournaments are nothing, but it was good, so I wanted to play.
[146:29.20]I was a fan of this game back in the day.
[146:33.70]Please surrender.
[146:35.80]Have mercy.
[146:36.62]We never truly believed in the cause anyway.
[146:39.62]Alright, we're going to focus here.
[146:41.14]The enemy Vanguard has retreated.
[146:44.02]Now is the time to advance.
[146:50.50]What is this?
[146:55.00]Oh, we just claimed it.
[147:01.41]Can I go that way?
[147:10.46]What the fuck is this?
[147:13.94]Take this!
[147:14.92]What's going on here?
[147:17.30]My blade can't cut through them!
[147:19.78]Take this!
[147:20.14]And they just keep coming!
[147:23.43]Guardian of Peace.
[147:29.83]Some things are so deeply ingrained that one can never forget them.
[147:35.56]You should know that.
[147:38.96]The all-seeing eyes of the sacred bird.
[147:42.96]Perhaps they will enable you to... I feel like you don't stop during the battle like this.
[147:47.16]You're going to get hit in the side of the head by a rock.
[147:51.46]Eyes of the sacred bird.
[147:57.96]Yes.
[147:58.98]With such eyes, it would be possible to see the flow of incense that bewitches men's hearts.
[148:14.26]We get detective vision, yeah.
[148:21.98]We gotta have detective vision in every game now, don't we?
[148:28.53]You know what's funny?
[148:29.81]I could be wrong on this, but I think detective games don't have detective vision.
[148:42.02]Okay.
[148:46.58]Your eyes of the sacred bird slow the health of those around you, as well as the situation on the battlefield.
[148:52.06]Use them well to maintain an advantage.
[148:53.94]I'm not understanding it.
[148:56.65]You can just kind of look at the battlefield?
[148:58.37]Alright.
[148:58.69]I need to go up.
[148:59.03]I need to get up there.
[149:00.09]Oh, wait.
[149:00.31]Hold on.
[149:00.53]Turn around.
[149:06.22]Apparently losing this fight.
[149:08.64]How?
[149:11.46]How could we be possibly losing this fight?
[149:30.46]I guess there's a lot of shadow people.
[149:43.92]Come on, we gotta, I gotta, we're losing down here.
[149:46.36]Oh, I have to go to the purple sus area.
[149:54.26]Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[150:00.87]Okay, here I am.
[150:02.64]What do I have to do?
[150:09.78]Wait, what's going on?
[150:11.88]Wait, I have to use it?
[150:17.12]How do I destroy it?
[150:21.47]I'm confused.
[150:26.39]it's right oh okay I thought it was like a I get it I thought it was an object I had to break right there so up here okay oh come on
[151:00.72]You're the reason why games have tutorials?
[151:03.48]It's funny because games that don't have tutorials, I do just fine.
[151:07.46]I think the tutorials are the ones that screw me up.
[151:09.38]What?
[151:09.58]I blocked it!
[151:31.71]Uh-oh.
[151:32.81]I have to assist at once.
[151:34.99]Alright, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[151:38.19]I gotta go.
[151:40.29]Alright, go, go, go.
[151:41.37]Forget it, forget it.
[151:41.85]These guys are just gonna die.
[151:42.79]They're putties.
[151:44.65]I have to only focus on the officers, not the putties.
[151:47.09]Are you gonna miss TikTok?
[151:48.74]Yeah, I mean...
[152:02.27]Yeah, the app that I, um... Yeah, I haven't opened once.
[152:08.13]I have not opened TikTok one time.
[152:13.23]Ever.
[152:16.45]Ever.
[152:21.03]I don't know.
[152:21.61]I don't know.
[152:22.53]I don't... I know that, like, YouTube shorts exist.
[152:29.86]Alright, here we go.
[152:31.17]Go, go, go, go, go, hurry.
[152:36.39]It's so funny because I've seen, I've seen like TikTok compilation videos on YouTube, but I have never seen a TikTok, like on a TikTok account.
[152:49.31]So this is the rumored sorcery of the yellow turban.
[152:52.87]Oh my goodness.
[152:53.80]I don't want to go in the middle of that.
[152:57.08]I shall gratefully accept your aid.
[153:13.51]there again there is a thing here there is there ever is it I'm to help me out be a fool to refuse your aid excellent now go for hey what you can do
[153:47.08]More come on, let's be done with this already.
[153:54.41]I think that actually if I didn't get it by the last one, that probably would have been faster.
[154:16.49]Our spell has been broken.
[154:31.97]Then we shall have to switch to an all-out attack!
[154:37.29]Shut him down.
[154:38.57]Alright, I think this is safe now.
[155:03.41]Save.
[155:03.69]Should I go save the people over at E?
[155:07.99]That's kind of a long ways away.
[155:09.39]Can I get in there?
[155:11.13]What is this?
[155:12.15]What do I think of the game so far?
[155:13.37]I think it's fun.
[155:14.51]Reminds me of the kind of old ones.
[155:31.76]Feels fun to play.
[155:32.32]I like it.
[155:51.40]I just, I'm destroying this person.
[156:06.10]No, don't do that.
[156:08.57]This plan belongs to us.
[156:19.66]I got a lot of help.
[156:21.80]Yeah, this is the first time I've been in kind of some real danger.
[156:23.90]Hold on here.
[156:39.85]The enemy officer has been defeated.
[156:46.33]No.
[156:50.69]Money goes everywhere here now.
[157:02.75]No giving up.
[157:03.61]This guy's got a ton of health.
[157:06.61]Come to help me out?
[157:07.93]I would be a fool to refuse your aid.
[157:12.12]This territory, the enemy officer has been defeated.
[157:22.44]OK, I think I'm going to go save.
[157:24.00]Oh shit, there are like generals under attack.
[157:27.46]We gotta kill this guy right now.
[157:30.74]Oh my God, there's so many people here.
[157:32.10]This is going to be.
[157:32.68]I don't know if I'm going to be able to do this.
[157:35.96]I'm in trouble.
[157:37.32]OK, I think I'm actually in trouble.
[157:47.28]Let us overcome this enemy.
[157:51.36]That guy just grew in size.
[157:52.62]I gotta get it.
[157:56.26]He's gonna die right now.
[158:16.41]No!
[158:16.87]How did I let them get through?
[158:50.55]Okay, I got it.
[158:51.67]My towers alone is insufficient for a comeback.
[159:18.82]It's too many generals.
[159:25.70]Die!
[159:26.24]Oh my god.
[159:26.88]Okay, I'll get it right here.
[159:33.19]Yes!
[159:33.73]Ooh, I got a spear.
[159:37.05]Worse.
[159:41.87]Okay, so I... Did I jump the gun there?
[159:44.85]Did I abandon everybody and just run?
[159:47.96]Kinda.
[159:48.35]Still win.
[159:49.15]You should have defended E. Yeah, true.
[160:17.41]That's 1, 2, 3, 4, Y, and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Y. So five swings.
[160:26.91]I definitely like the sword so far.
[160:39.24]I have a plus five right now.
[160:47.78]what's more important getting the whirlwind kick or getting uh evasion probably evasion I can do it more than once I think you don't have enough smithing stones
[161:24.14]That one, I almost actually lost that one, so... You would have been a TikTok star if you were born 15 years later.
[161:31.56]Uh...
[161:52.69]Across... Across the, uh, all the TikTok universe.
[161:56.61]I'll make sure you understand.
[161:58.17]The, uh, the Jerma tag on TikTok had like six billion views.
[162:02.11]Okay?
[162:03.15]I already was a fucking TikTok star.
[162:04.85]Okay?
[162:07.76]Ah, you might be right, brother.
[162:10.08]But it still aggravates me.
[162:15.36]Yes.
[162:17.22]I am of the same opinion.
[162:22.96]Your ego just blew up my toilet.
[162:24.80]I remain.
[162:25.16]Some of those 2016 to like 2018 streams.
[162:27.72]We owe.
[162:47.83]To be young again this warrior who saw he too deserves your lordship's praise I see So that clear-eyed gaze of yours sees through sorcery does it You rise above the chaos on the ground roam the length of the battlefield Find the path to victory
[163:16.75]like a bird of prey soaring in the sky.
[163:20.47]The Luan, that should be your name.
[163:25.80]A winged omen that heralds the reign of a good king and condemns that of a wicked king, leading the world toward peace.
[163:37.18]Peace and the Luan.
[163:41.09]Salsa stop warbling like a poet you're just confusing them his lordship is a true scholar I Tried arguing with them on in comments.
[163:52.06]I got bullied It has a nice ring to it and fits you well Yes, I like it too
[164:08.92]Vine, Musical.ly, TikTok, they're all gone.
[164:11.28]I remain.
[164:11.86]Oh god.
[164:37.35]Has your old ability come back to you?
[164:42.77]Your eyes can see things others cannot.
[164:47.23]That should help you in the fight against the I don't know anything about social media anymore.
[164:51.57]And I just don't.
[164:53.13]I don't even pay attention.
[164:55.97]Defeating the enemy is our purpose.
[164:58.41]I pay attention as little as the minimum amount that I need to pay attention to it.
[165:07.96]...to stop the leader of the Yellow Turbans.
[165:11.20]Yongjiao... ...our goals align.
[165:15.14]Besides... ...you must survive... ...for the sake of those who did not.
[165:29.31]I mean, I'm not going to pretend that I'm like, you know, I have, yeah, well, I've never had a TikTok account, so I'm so much more superior than everybody that does.
[165:40.94]No, I've consumed short reels and TikToks and compilations and YouTube shorts and stuff.
[165:47.00]I'm not going to be that guy.
[165:55.41]But, I don't know, maybe like
[165:58.62]times a week like once a week I I can't even think of the last time I went through youtube shorts it's been a very long time it's been at least like a month oh you can do this on the map and find old coins
[166:32.83]Last time you sat in bed with the iPad on your stomach.
[166:38.83]10 hours ago.
[166:40.11]Training is important, but you all need proper rest before battle.
[166:59.54]Should I do one of these medium missions?
[167:00.82]I think this is what it is.
[167:04.54]Does it ever hit your face?
[167:07.82]I got one of those devices that you stick the iPad on and it kind of attaches to the back of like a panel and it keeps it upright.
[167:20.79]Because way too many times, yeah, I did the thing where you fall asleep and you're holding the iPad and it hits you on the bottom of your chin.
[167:27.17]Yeah, you guys have seen the picture of me with it.
[167:37.19]in the multiple sleep pictures of me.
[167:49.98]Are a couple of those, I think at least one of those sleep pictures is fake.
[167:54.51]Of like the three or four that exist.
[168:10.19]Sure, buddy.
[168:11.29]Yeah, I was sure.
[168:14.77]The worst ones are the real ones, though.
[168:21.22]What's up with that penis shirt picture, you freak?
[168:25.12]Um, there's a, there's a, what are you, is this 2013?
[168:33.85]Okay, there are new training sessions available.
[168:43.12]I'm definitely going to do that.
[168:46.56]Did I do that?
[168:48.50]There's a lot of stuff to do.
[168:50.66]This feels way more in-depth than any of the other ones I've played.
[168:54.37]Did I do the training?
[168:58.27]Feed 100 foes with... Oh, I think you just do it.
[169:12.23]They're kinda like achievements.
[169:29.03]Kids these days will never know the joy of a cartoon mascot trying to get them addicted to cigarettes.
[169:41.87]I mean, I need to sell some shit.
[169:45.07]Oh fuck, I just started the mission.
[169:50.15]I wanted to sell.
[169:50.73]Oh, oops.
[169:58.39]Lord Shu Jin, you wish to see me?
[170:03.28]I did.
[170:04.28]We have a job for you and your meth here in Jing.
[170:07.70]Our advanced forces have already driven the yellow turbines back into one castle.
[170:14.35]We want your volunteers to rendezvous with the Vanguard and finish off the enemy together.
[170:24.35]The Vanguard you say?
[170:29.34]I'm looking at this chat.
[170:30.74]I'm not worried about AI at all.
[170:32.74]Not anymore.
[170:34.86]Imagine this chat getting scraped.
[170:37.08]You're gonna fuck up the whole algorithm.
[170:42.45]Very well, my lord.
[170:44.33]In our hands, the mission is as good as done.
[170:48.47]Excellent.
[170:49.93]Good luck, Liu Bei.
[171:00.19]A report, my lord.
[171:08.34]You'll look over in this chat and you'll see stuff like, oh, hey, haha, I put, I smeared butter on my butt cheeks and sat in the chair and then I went to work or something.
[171:16.34]It's like, what are you even talking about?
[171:22.00]Lord Sun Zhen has arrived.
[171:23.86]He asks for an audience with you, my lord.
[171:34.43]Think about how we became this way.
[171:47.28]Everybody wants to be a Ball Fondler.
[171:49.66]That's all I'm saying.
[171:52.71]Ball Fondler makes a splash.
[171:58.16]I, Sun Jian, come humbly before you.
[172:03.28]If you've been in this stream for a month, if you've been on this channel, you know what that's a reference to.
[172:13.29]Very good.
[172:15.29]I have heard about your achievements.
[172:23.66]I am honored.
[172:27.81]I wish to see your strength under my flag, but you guys don't know who that is.
[172:33.55]How long have some?
[172:35.35]This is crazy to me.
[172:44.28]Hey, this is a very good opportunity for me to do this.
[172:48.81]Okay.
[172:51.19]The Archive Channel just did a restream yesterday.
[172:56.32]They did the movies, the original movies stream.
[173:00.14]The Archive Channel has been doing a couple of restreams a month of older streams.
[173:05.72]So you can kind of have an active chat.
[173:09.81]So it's like being able to watch a stream from 10 years ago.
[173:14.35]its original format and then effectively you have a uh like an active chat not like a VOD chat um but yeah that's a good opportunity for you guys to go see some old stuff I want to and I I really do want to probably start to rethink how I do and I know I'm going to be stalling here for a second but
[173:39.46]The 3DO stream and when I was like, oh yeah, I'm going to play 3DO again.
[173:43.83]And there was a ton of people that are just like, what the fuck is a 3DO?
[173:46.33]I'm like, what do you mean?
[173:46.99]What is a 3DO?
[173:50.83]There's been a lot of streams that I think a lot of people just don't have never even heard of.
[173:57.34]So maybe it's time to maybe go start putting them up.
[174:00.54]Maybe like do some of the, have the archive channel do the restreams and
[174:06.83]It has been a long time.
[174:07.91]12 years is a long time.
[174:08.83]Yeah.
[174:09.59]I think I did the math recently and it's crazy because I have a lot of videos, but I never was uploading every day or even every other day, even back during like 2011, I would do maybe a couple uploads a week.
[174:27.00]I can't imagine how much content there is a lot of these streamers and YouTubers that have been doing this as long as I have.
[174:34.20]They probably have two or three times as many videos and streams that I do.
[174:40.24]I think I did the math.
[174:41.46]It was about like a year straight.
[174:45.93]It was like 365 days if you were to watch every video and every stream I've ever done.
[174:53.27]Which that's just not feasible.
[174:57.42]That's impossible.
[175:02.88]I see.
[175:04.70]So you wish me to join your command?
[175:08.34]Yes, I know I am asking a lot of you.
[175:10.60]I've seen it all.
[175:11.76]But I only do so because I have great faith in your abilities.
[175:19.22]And you've come here in person.
[175:21.82]Surely my request is not too outrageous.
[175:26.08]Your life is like One Piece now.
[175:32.70]Oh, no.
[175:35.29]Yeah, it's like, wait a minute.
[175:36.73]How many episodes of Dragon Ball Z are there?
[175:38.89]2,000?
[175:38.91]Nah, I don't know.
[175:42.25]I don't know if I want to get into that.
[175:53.96]I did not expect such humility.
[175:56.82]You need only tell me to follow your orders, Lord Jujin.
[176:01.24]Okay, but what if you got like 10 episodes of Dragon Ball Z condensed down into one episode of television?
[176:12.24]You are the general of the household.
[176:15.24]Nah, that would be dog shit.
[176:16.28]Never mind.
[176:17.71]Why would I hesitate to accept your offer?
[176:22.29]That would be total dog shit.
[176:23.65]They'd have to skip over so much stuff.
[176:28.02]Just abridged.
[176:37.42]Alright, so next stream.
[176:49.84]I'm going to do a I'm going to do a recap of the previous like 10 streams.
[176:54.75]With music behind it, and it's going to be like previously on Jerma.
[177:02.05]It's going to be just fucking terrible.
[177:05.35]Just to catch everybody up, you know?
[177:06.53]Because, you know, what's the 3DO?
[177:08.37]Add a ton of like drama into it, like it's going to be a big deal.
[177:17.73]And then it's just me sitting here kind of quiet, hanging out, playing Dynasty Warriors.
[177:22.79]I heard there was someone who saw right through the Yellow Turban's tricks in the last battle.
[177:35.87]Alright, I got one.
[177:44.03]I don't think we're even gonna be able to do it.
[177:48.49]Yeah, spoil the next episode with the title card.
[177:50.91]Yeah, I'll say what the next stream's gonna be in the title of the next one.
[177:57.21]I'm gonna tell what the stream, like, two streams after that is.
[178:22.15]Am I actually doing that right?
[178:23.23]Should I not be spamming it?
[178:49.08]Picking up the nectar water occasionally dropped by enemies will replenish your... Okay.
[178:53.50]Bravery.
[178:54.68]What does it look like?
[179:00.11]I don't see it on the ground.
[179:01.79]Did I already get it?
[179:08.34]Alright, it was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[179:08.76]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[179:08.98]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[179:09.08]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[179:09.18]Nice.
[179:37.68]Record a segment to play at the end of the stream to tease the next one.
[179:41.27]And then replicate the same moment on stream.
[179:48.73]Okay, I'm like on webcam.
[179:55.48]It's like, oh my god, what happens next time?
[179:59.76]And there is, like, my webcam.
[180:02.04]I'm just like, okay, guys.
[180:03.76]Oh, fuck!
[180:04.22]And I'm in, like, a huge battle with something.
[180:05.93]Like, my fucking, like, my, like, room explodes.
[180:09.47]And I'm on, like, webcam.
[180:10.67]And I'm, like, fighting a monster or something.
[180:13.03]None of this shit happens at all over any of the streams.
[180:31.74]I want to buy some stuff.
[180:34.58]He's the finale with 1000 episodes in advance.
[180:40.06]If you're willing to risk your life, being in the army at least guarantees you'll have food to eat.
[180:48.59]The teaser is me just flatlining in a bed.
[180:50.89]It's like what?
[180:54.17]When does that happen?
[180:55.89]The next stream, everything's fine.
[181:13.04]That clip of you playing, it was definitely my cry when your house got moved.
[181:29.92]That was honestly the scariest shit ever.
[181:49.98]That hurt big time.
[181:57.51]Every time I think about that clip that was so awful it was one of the worst things ever but the one comment about how somebody was like it really did sound like somebody not like threw a grenade into his window wherever he was screaming.
[182:19.74]You hear like glass sh-
[182:26.50]It makes me laugh every time I think about it.
[182:28.18]It's so stupid.
[182:29.46]A car drove through your wall live.
[182:43.11]Hey, it was a horrible thing that happened, but I'm glad at least we can laugh about it because it's like the funniest thing ever to me.
[182:50.44]Take that with all my might.
[182:59.71]Now's the time!
[183:01.55]Take this!
[183:03.23]And open up!
[183:28.81]Alright, where's this boss?
[183:31.39]Alright, do something.
[183:35.15]Do something.
[183:48.14]There we go.
[183:58.77]It was so awful.
[184:11.11]Elden Ring streams were basically DBZ because Millenia you were on the same fight for three streams in a row.
[184:19.24]Yeah.
[184:30.38]Stop an enemy attack.
[184:31.68]Oh, I didn't do that.
[184:37.26]This is 20.
[184:37.54]30.
[184:37.76]Might as well just get it.
[184:43.71]How do I do this?
[184:54.32]You beat Messmer faster than I could though, so GG on that.
[184:58.12]I had played the game before.
[185:00.64]That was not the first time I'd seen Messmer when I did it on stream with Ster.
[185:07.11]I was a jumping R2 Andy though, so.
[185:10.49]Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do to win.
[185:26.31]Oh, I got a new one now.
[185:28.09]That's A. So this is a super dash.
[185:33.69]What do you do with these coins?
[185:55.14]You wouldn't even do the cut to interview stream with the boys.
[186:01.54]Oh yeah, that's right.
[186:08.59]I want a town.
[186:09.23]I want to buy something.
[186:12.33]Where is there an inn?
[186:12.95]What's that inn I was just at before?
[186:21.60]That's not good enough.
[186:23.23]You won't even touch the yellow turbines fighting like that.
[186:25.87]This suppression of you province.
[186:28.29]I'll just do this right now.
[186:34.49]You get accessory for this one.
[186:44.54]It's the loudest thing that's ever happened on screen.
[186:46.36]Probably that.
[186:48.79]I would say it has to be that.
[186:54.31]400 enemies.
[186:57.42]We cannot afford to lose this position.
[186:59.74]I shall personally see to its defense.
[187:13.58]Who's there?
[187:25.62]Alright, we're winning.
[187:28.42]The jumpscare in that vent was pretty loud too.
[187:30.20]There's been some very loud moments over the years, but as of now, there's a pretty strict limiter on the desktop audio.
[187:45.93]It's crazy because I thought one was there already, but it has been improved.
[188:02.57]Oh, I forgot to ask this.
[188:07.10]Can you guys, does the audio sound weird?
[188:09.12]Because I'm playing this through speakers, not through headphones.
[188:13.77]Does it sound strange sometimes or not really?
[188:16.27]Can't tell?
[188:16.57]Good.
[188:27.18]Selecting places like an officer's location or base will allow you to view the path to those... Oh, that's actually worth doing.
[188:33.74]So wonderful.
[188:51.78]Okay, here we go.
[188:53.96]There's a lot of people just came through.
[189:24.07]No, I didn't even hit anybody with that.
[189:34.18]That wasn't very flashy, but I did it.
[189:35.66]Take that.
[189:37.32]Get ready to be brought down.
[189:39.38]Time to act.
[190:01.55]That's a good combo.
[190:14.86]Did I miss any item?
[190:23.42]I have to go sell this stuff.
[190:43.94]Have you painted your nails before?
[190:52.55]Yes, I've had a spa day from a couple of nieces.
[191:06.95]Yeah, it's welcome to our spa.
[191:11.02]It's like, oh, okay.
[191:13.96]And he's like, oh, what color do you want?
[191:15.90]Well, the owner of the spa's choice.
[191:36.60]Is there a reason to save points for when all these get unlocked or?
[191:42.42]I don't know.
[191:57.90]What color was it?
[191:58.56]I think it was glitter.
[192:04.33]Yeah, and your fingernails are all fucked up after this, by the way.
[192:09.56]The amount of nail polish that somehow gets in your hair somehow.
[192:16.22]Each one of your nails has just like too much.
[192:18.45]It's like caked up on the end.
[192:21.29]It's somehow all over the base of your fingers too.
[192:25.05]And you're just kind of like, oh yay!
[192:27.89]Look at it!
[192:29.07]This is wonderful!
[192:49.52]More health and more damage, always.
[192:51.10]I have way, alright, way, way, way, I have way too many of these.
[193:04.84]Boost damage to soldiers by 7%.
[193:06.26]Strong attacks by 5%.
[193:17.45]Normal attack strength by five.
[193:19.01]Actually, this is probably the best one.
[193:32.46]I really have to sell stuff.
[193:33.66]Do you have any gems?
[193:51.39]Training is important.
[193:52.63]Yeah, we're.
[194:01.64]Prison in.
[194:08.00]To go a city, right?
[194:09.30]What's the nearest city?
[194:09.98]Do you sell in any town if you're willing to risk your life being in the army?
[194:15.31]At least guarantees you'll have food to eat.
[194:24.81]Did you go on the swing at the playground?
[194:29.33]Alright, it's time for me to tell you guys another one of my weird things that I don't like.
[194:34.84]I don't like the swing.
[194:37.04]I don't know, it kind of freaks me out.
[194:41.73]Everybody's too close.
[194:43.96]It's, you know, you got like one, two, three, four swings and people are just like, push, push, push.
[194:50.14]And people flying back and forth.
[194:52.48]And maybe sometimes they're going to the side to side a little too far.
[194:55.02]I enjoy the swing when it's a careful environment.
[195:09.84]Bro, you are so high right now.
[195:11.46]I'm not.
[195:12.08]I'm perfectly fine.
[195:28.52]Alright, who else used to do this?
[195:32.67]What is wrong with us as human beings?
[195:36.13]Okay, let's go on the swing.
[195:38.19]Back.
[195:39.28]Forth.
[195:40.30]Back.
[195:41.64]Forth.
[195:42.44]I don't have a helmet on.
[195:43.28]Back.
[195:44.46]Forth.
[195:45.06]I'm going faster.
[195:45.88]Back.
[195:46.34]Forth.
[195:46.90]Back, forth.
[195:47.45]No knee pads.
[195:48.13]Back, forth.
[195:49.75]Altitude.
[195:50.45]Altitude.
[195:51.03]Speed.
[195:51.49]Speed.
[195:51.77]I don't have any shin guards on.
[195:52.89]Anything.
[195:53.17]I'm not wearing a helmet.
[195:54.23]Back, forth.
[195:55.19]Jump out of the fucking seat and fly.
[195:57.66]And fly and just land on the ground.
[196:02.30]What the hell is wrong with us?
[196:03.34]Why do we do that?
[196:11.25]That was fun.
[196:13.23]That was the thing that I did for fun.
[196:14.69]I was like, go as far as I can and I'm jumping out.
[196:17.25]I'm launching out of this.
[196:21.41]And you would just pratfall onto the grass.
[196:28.08]And you go like, yeah!
[196:29.54]You get back to the seat and you do it again.
[196:41.98]That's not good enough.
[196:44.04]As a kid, as a kid.
[196:44.82]No, no, I'm talking about like right now.
[196:46.22]Like this.
[196:46.82]Wait, what?
[196:47.36]You guys don't still do that?
[196:48.09]What a hero.
[197:09.31]Imagine a 40 year old guy swinging on the swing at the playground going really fast and just bailing like a skateboard video game bailing at the peak of the altitude just flying and landing on his back and stomach and stuff.
[197:39.78]Mad Blade Rush.
[197:47.16]Yeah, I love doing that stuff when I was a kid.
[197:52.74]And then you do one one of those times and you're like, wait, that one hurt.
[197:57.77]Okay, I need to take a quick break.
[198:02.23]I'm going to go eat my bologna and cheese sandwich plain.
[198:06.55]Or tuna fish sandwich.
[198:17.20]Two in a sandwich with a bag of chips.
[198:19.76]I don't think you can get much better than that.
[198:24.48]I heard there was someone who saw right through the yellow turbines.
[198:36.73]Alright, let's destroy this one.
[198:44.39]Nice nursing home food.
[198:47.59]Tuna sandwiches S tier.
[198:48.61]Especially a good one.
[198:51.87]Okay, this one looks hard.
[199:13.55]That's the ultimate goal is up there.
[199:19.49]OK.
[199:27.34]Alright, so these two have to live, right?
[199:30.20]And there in the bottom right corner.
[199:31.64]So just as long as the bottom right corner is fine and we find.
[199:34.18]Tuna or salmon.
[199:38.98]If you could only ever have either one.
[199:41.78]Yeah, it's tuna every time.
[199:45.17]Just so much easier to make.
[200:00.90]Alright, so we clear the middle.
[200:04.04]Just make sure these two don't die.
[200:08.83]You can eat salmon raw.
[200:09.77]It's called sushi.
[200:12.37]I like Philadelphia rolls, but I don't really like a whole lot else.
[200:18.53]Spicy tuna is good.
[200:20.06]Philadelphia rolls are good.
[200:21.04]I think we've had this same conversation like three or four hundred times at this point.
[200:26.02]But, you know, we've reintegrated.
[200:29.37]Yes, many things.
[200:35.69]Alright.
[200:36.95]So I'm going to go should I go up the left side and hug in the right wall?
[200:41.45]Should I go right and take out that front door?
[200:55.66]Through the middle.
[201:01.63]Yeah, I'll go right.
[201:09.73]I kinda like that.
[201:10.54]I wanna try it.
[201:17.24]Good luck to you.
[201:34.05]Morale.
[201:36.55]Alright, better morale.
[201:37.95]Hold the line.
[201:39.51]Show them what we yellow turbans are made of.
[201:43.26]The enemy has no choice but to hole up in their castle.
[201:46.60]Yeah, I'm going A. Ready the attack.
[201:50.34]Give them hell.
[201:54.60]Rose, follow me if you can keep up.
[201:58.38]This castle will be ours.
[202:01.89]What was that thing you said about trying pretzels and tuna?
[202:12.30]There is something that happens.
[202:13.80]I don't know what it is.
[202:14.46]I don't know why.
[202:16.06]Some food doctor will be able to tell you why.
[202:22.55]When you eat pretzels and tuna fish.
[202:26.55]And I'm talking tuna salad, right?
[202:28.27]Like tuna with mayo, you know, salt, pepper, whatever.
[202:33.67]I wouldn't go too crazy after that.
[202:36.65]But like a tuna salad and like a pretzel stick.
[202:41.39]You eat them together.
[202:42.29]It does something unbelievable.
[202:47.57]It's something magical happens.
[202:49.61]What is going on?
[202:51.45]Oh, they're firing arrows.
[202:56.16]You can... Oh, I didn't read that.
[202:59.64]Give the order to... We got a ram.
[203:06.49]Okay.
[203:09.27]Oh, I think we have to, like, Pikmin-style destroy this.
[203:12.95]Oh, no.
[203:14.75]Never mind.
[203:16.45]Are there any officers over here?
[203:27.83]Inspiration?
[203:28.47]Uh oh.
[203:29.97]I'm gonna shut that down right now.
[203:37.04]Allies left to defend for themselves and in red battle areas will be forced to flee.
[203:41.18]Okay.
[203:45.46]Concentrate!
[203:53.91]Where's this?
[203:54.27]Where's Jay?
[203:55.83]Where's that?
[203:58.10]Where's Jay?
[203:59.18]Is it right here with me?
[204:01.16]I'm in H right now, right?
[204:02.22]Where's Jay?
[204:02.78]Alright, I'm just going up front.
[204:20.61]Alright.
[204:36.40]Destroy this thing quick!
[204:47.59]You don't have enough allies to destroy it?
[205:02.34]Alright, get rid of that.
[205:04.83]Okay, keep going.
[205:16.23]How's everybody else doing?
[205:17.01]I think everyone else is fine.
[205:23.05]Dude, just kill people, bro.
[205:24.23]It's the only thing you have to do.
[205:32.64]I want to save my Musu for this.
[205:34.24]Alright, let's just get up here and do it.
[205:36.38]Can you parry the big heavy weapons?
[206:04.14]Okay, another one down
[206:31.30]Alright, take this down.
[206:32.48]What else is there?
[206:34.26]There's too many.
[206:34.90]I have to clear so much more than I'm doing.
[207:02.65]critically damaged.
[207:03.93]Uh-oh.
[207:15.90]Another general.
[207:16.54]I think they're all funneling into down here.
[207:18.66]Oh my goodness.
[207:19.48]Look at how many.
[207:20.09]Look at this.
[207:27.19]Kind of wasted that, but whatever.
[207:34.31]Okay.
[207:34.55]They're doing fine, right?
[207:35.85]Where's that group?
[207:37.07]Where is he?
[207:38.15]Yeah, they're okay.
[207:41.14]They're right here.
[207:56.13]Glork are trying to overthrow you.
[208:03.65]I think we're good.
[208:07.95]I'm going to keep going.
[208:09.39]Alright, I'm going to stay with the ram.
[208:20.12]Should I go?
[208:23.62]Yeah.
[208:25.99]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[208:27.24]Stay with it.
[208:32.20]Now we can proceed.
[208:33.18]Okay.
[208:35.78]Smash it.
[208:40.81]The gates.
[208:42.29]We won't be able to hold out much longer.
[208:50.86]Oh.
[208:58.05]That was quick.
[209:10.88]Alright, now it's just.
[209:15.78]This has been pretty clean.
[209:19.10]I don't know what level this one was, but I was kind of scared of it myself for the first time.
[209:28.15]Sorcery.
[209:28.67]Oh, there's a lot of guys over here.
[209:33.79]Oh shit, I have a double dash now.
[209:35.93]Oh my god, there's a lot.
[209:37.32]Where's the... Hold on.
[209:38.62]I'm going way too far.
[209:56.76]This way?
[210:03.82]This way?
[210:09.51]Where the hell is this thing?
[210:30.06]Why would the trail lead over here?
[210:41.25]Down here?
[210:44.04]This is not working out.
[210:47.52]He's been training not enough.
[210:57.64]I know you don't need to Luigi me.
[211:00.76]I understand.
[211:01.22]It's just like there's like 10 paths.
[211:03.42]OK, other canister.
[211:19.53]It's all the way on the other side.
[211:23.15]I'm not fighting these if I don't have to.
[211:25.89]Best shopping mall food pizza.
[211:28.31]Mall pizza.
[211:29.91]Or... There's usually an awesome teriyaki chicken place in most malls.
[211:37.85]I would say teriyaki chicken or pizza.
[211:39.21]Or like one and two.
[211:40.65]Alright, it is all the way down there.
[211:46.72]Yeah.
[211:55.56]Ow.
[212:05.22]Shit.
[212:08.61]They just... They're like blocking.
[212:12.03]Pulling the spears out.
[212:14.95]They're just an environmental hazard here.
[212:25.02]Okay, this way.
[212:26.06]So many people to go through.
[212:53.82]What is this game?
[212:54.32]This is Dynasty Warriors Origins.
[213:06.99]Alright, let's go kill him.
[213:08.47]Damn!
[213:19.72]You ever played Chivalry 2?
[213:20.86]I did a long time ago.
[213:21.80]This one.
[213:22.10]I like it.
[213:39.40]Focus not on the known.
[213:42.46]Think of your family.
[213:43.74]Take him out in one hit.
[213:44.84]Don't throw your lives away so easily.
[213:50.32]That was pretty sick.
[213:51.45]Alright, here they all come.
[213:53.99]Alright, here we go.
[213:56.63]How dare you deceive my comrades?
[214:00.65]If my dear was asked what they wanted...
[214:05.87]Their true desire is not some new era, but simply enough food to survive.
[214:13.25]Oh, there he is.
[214:13.69]Alright.
[214:14.57]Let me kill the generals first.
[214:15.53]Try to get items.
[214:17.65]I need help.
[214:18.29]Absolute timing.
[214:23.28]The enemy officer has been defeated.
[214:26.36]Everybody has a good amount of health, right?
[214:27.90]Okay, these guys don't even have 50%, so we're good.
[214:29.58]This is kind of embarrassing.
[214:30.88]Welcome.
[214:31.30]Welcome.
[214:34.47]I killed every single enemy.
[215:04.08]How does it compare to Devil May Cry?
[215:05.18]They're very different games for sure.
[215:06.73]I would say not really at all.
[215:12.19]Well, I mean, no.
[215:16.74]Although I've only played one Devil May Cry.
[215:20.28]And now I don't want to play any other ones ever again because my room exploded when I played that one.
[215:31.01]I did beat it though.
[215:32.21]Everybody thought I was going to get to Virgil and quit the game and I almost did like 10 times.
[215:50.53]The MC5 is hilarious.
[216:16.00]Now you felt like shit during that, but that was literally the funniest things ever.
[216:19.31]I recognize I'm glad.
[216:21.41]Hey, you know what?
[216:21.99]That makes me happy if you thought that was so interesting or so funny or so stupid.
[216:28.77]That it made you out of school, but.
[216:32.15]It was you.
[216:33.83]I'm glad there's something you can look back on and be like that was fucking funny.
[216:38.51]No.
[216:40.11]Not with the sword, but with your words.
[216:43.13]To persuade the yellow turbans to lay down their weapons.
[216:46.49]At my expense, by the way.
[216:50.09]Better that than suffering them to die in vain.
[216:58.73]The yellow turbans have their cause, right or not.
[217:02.22]I understand what drives men to die for what they believe in.
[217:08.45]I was taking a shit when it happened and I heard a huge bang from the other room.
[217:13.91]Did you think that a asteroid hit your house?
[217:15.37]You probably thought something fell down in your room.
[217:35.55]That's what I would think.
[217:37.63]Like what the hell did my speakers fall off or my chair fall down?
[217:40.25]We would all fight for you like your army in this game.
[218:03.90]I don't know.
[218:04.92]I don't think we'd get very far.
[218:06.06]How many people here?
[218:08.68]Okay, there's 12,000 people here.
[218:11.00]There's probably like a thousand of us.
[218:12.40]I'm going to put me in this category.
[218:15.46]Oh.
[218:29.11]Could we?
[218:31.32]Is there like, do you think that, okay, out of 12,000 people, do you think there's more than a thousand that could take on like 10 people at once?
[218:39.79]I don't know I don't know what's the percentage there it's probably best you don't know the details then I shall pretend I never asked and yeah I said I put myself in that category I've told you guys like I'll I'll just go grab it you seem when officials turn to tyranny it is a sign that imperial power is weakening at such times we must rise to the occasion I am sure that we will have the chance to fight together again sometime
[219:09.34]I for one look forward to it.
[219:21.32]I'm the guy that before the fight starts, it's like, oh shit, it's getting real.
[219:24.69]Alright, we got it.
[219:25.87]We got our boys here.
[219:26.83]Alright.
[219:28.01]I take my shirt off.
[219:30.73]And then I put both of my arms out in fists.
[219:33.79]Like a T-pose.
[219:35.43]I make fists.
[219:37.13]And I just spin in a circle as fast as I fucking can.
[219:40.67]And just walk towards stuff.
[219:42.13]And I'm just going to hit whoever the fuck I hit.
[219:55.04]And then I do that and I kind of start to get a little disoriented.
[219:58.46]And I kind of make my way into the street and get hit by a fucking bus.
[220:17.14]Why are you a beat-em-up enemy?
[220:20.70]What was it?
[220:22.77]Oh, that's... I love that.
[220:23.87]One guy?
[220:24.03]What?
[220:24.37]Oh, you thought he said, I am one guy.
[220:31.34]That's funny.
[220:52.67]You acted of your own volition to take care of things, even when the enemy started using those strange tricks.
[221:02.47]When I saw that, I knew you were awfully level-headed, more than just brawn.
[221:08.17]So tell me, who are you really?
[221:14.01]You don't seem the type to go home and work the fields once the army is disbanded.
[221:23.82]Why are you playing this?
[221:24.64]They want to.
[221:43.47]However, having you among our forces will allow us to respond to a variety of situations.
[221:49.63]That was a big Dynasty Warriors fan.
[221:51.95]Back when Dynasty Warriors 2 came out.
[221:54.76]That's the kind of game.
[221:58.54]I was lined up at the GameStop for that one.
[222:03.52]You have the valuable knack of realizing what must be done and what must be sacrificed to achieve a goal.
[222:15.17]From now on, Dynasty Warriors 3.
[222:17.21]Yeah, that was probably the best one in the whole franchise, right?
[222:22.88]One of the first one of the sequels, the early sequels were probably the best one.
[222:27.00]I will be counting on you.
[222:33.06]So you know how to be agreeable as well.
[222:37.31]Well, it is time we departed, but I'm glad we've come to know each other.
[222:53.24]Midnight releases were so fun.
[222:55.36]Yeah.
[222:58.53]You know, I'm actually some companies might do this, but I'm actually kind of surprised that
[223:05.08]I feel like there's some room to have some type of fun event that a game company could do.
[223:09.29]For those of you that don't remember or weren't maybe around for it, it used to be that was a huge deal.
[223:15.75]It was at, you know, 12.01.
[223:18.03]The store was going to be open.
[223:19.05]It was midnight.
[223:19.59]Oh, my God.
[223:20.21]The GameStop is open at midnight?
[223:21.77]No way.
[223:22.15]This is crazy.
[223:24.27]And a game company kind of coming in and replacing those would be kind of interesting.
[223:31.33]Yeah, on a Tuesday.
[223:32.07]Oh, yeah.
[223:33.65]Like, imagine if, um, like, let's just say, like, a random game comes out.
[223:37.41]People are looking forward to it.
[223:38.33]Oh, my God, I can't wait till it unlocks on Steam or whatever at midnight.
[223:43.17]What if they picked, like, a few cities in, you know, or a handful of cities across the country?
[223:48.80]Or across the world, even.
[223:51.00]And held, like, a little party.
[223:53.22]Like, a little, hey, it's, like, starts at 10 or starts at 9.
[223:56.04]And when the game comes out, like, okay, here we are.
[223:57.80]It's midnight release.
[224:00.18]I feel like that'd be kind of fun.
[224:02.32]Set up some ways to have people play it and stuff.
[224:12.82]It would be packed.
[224:15.47]Yeah, but I mean, I say like do it right.
[224:17.15]You know, have it in a venue.
[224:19.29]Have it something you have to actually say you want to go to.
[224:24.21]Nintendo still does it.
[224:26.17]Kind of like an album release party.
[224:27.54]Yeah!
[224:29.96]Yes.
[224:35.06]Huangfu Song went with Cao Cao in pursuit of Zhang Bao.
[224:40.61]We will lead Sun Jian and go after Zhang Liang.
[224:46.34]many games have you done midnight releases for all the warcraft all the World of Warcraft expansions up until probably at least cataclysm smash brothers brawl for sure be at our mercy the survivors will try to regroup
[225:08.19]Combine their forces in one place.
[225:11.91]Yeah, I I don't know how many guys realize how big of a deal brawl was when it was coming out.
[225:18.20]Brawl was the Infinity War of.
[225:22.32]That whole generation for for me.
[225:29.49]Of course.
[225:30.85]G province.
[225:32.69]The home base of the yellow turbans.
[225:38.19]Halo 2, 3.
[225:38.99]Yeah, Halo 2 was another.
[225:40.53]I wasn't the big Halo guy.
[225:43.29]But they were massive, massive, massive.
[225:48.05]The Snake and Sonic trailer was huge.
[225:50.09]Yeah, the Snake and Sonic trailer for Brawl may as well.
[225:54.42]If people were on Twitter, that would be trending with like 500,000 tweets.
[225:59.28]Yes.
[226:07.01]There's a comment on your last video that says Infinity War is the only film he ever talks about and it's true.
[226:39.92]No.
[226:41.24]I talk about Gremlins 2 as well.
[226:50.70]And all the Ernest movies.
[226:55.14]And Lord of the Rings.
[226:55.86]Yeah, the only movies you ever have to watch for the rest of your life are every Ernest movie.
[227:01.73]The Gremlins movies.
[227:04.54]infinity war only and just go to like wikipedia and read like what happened in the last eight movies just just infinity war um ghostbusters one ghostbusters two yeah all the muppet movies yes until I met him I was a mediocre student but he changed my attitude for that I owe him a great deal
[227:30.43]What was the Ernest movie you cried at?
[227:33.57]Oh, Christmas Baby?
[227:35.55]No, what was it?
[227:36.37]I did cry at an Ernest movie.
[227:44.76]I actually did, yeah.
[227:47.78]For real.
[227:51.72]No, it was Scared Stupid, was it?
[227:53.46]Why did I cry at it?
[227:56.47]It was the Halloween one with the dog.
[228:02.56]Yeah, no, those movies were fucking awesome.
[228:05.02]And they were emotional.
[228:06.02]You also said you never watched Titanic.
[228:20.73]Yeah, but I did, though, because you know when a movie comes out and everybody talks about it, and over the course of a few months, you somehow get to hear every scene and hear every piece of dialogue?
[228:32.20]I've already seen that movie because this conversation, that conversation, somebody talking about that scene, and this is their favorite scene.
[228:39.26]Remember that part?
[228:40.56]I don't need to even watch it.
[228:43.63]I've absorbed it through random popular culture conversations over the last 25 years.
[228:48.37]What a hero.
[228:55.94]Training is important, but you all need proper rest before battle.
[229:03.60]You haven't seen shit, you fake ass poser.
[229:06.28]Hey, how are you?
[229:09.27]What the fuck?
[229:11.97]You're not wrong.
[229:12.77]No, I haven't seen shit.
[229:14.63]You're right.
[229:16.31]But if I was a poser, wouldn't that mean that I'm like
[229:24.35]I'm trying to be like, oh, look at how I'm trying to jump on like a bandwagon of a movie.
[229:28.11]I don't really watch very much.
[229:29.07]Oh, so you know who I am.
[229:35.24]Good to hear.
[229:40.50]Suppose I should explain why I, Xiaohu Yuan, took the time just to come to see you.
[229:46.53]It was one of the biggest blockbusters of all time.
[229:48.75]You're being contrarian.
[229:50.23]No, I just haven't seen it.
[229:52.53]I'm sure it's a wonderful film.
[229:55.95]I'm sure it's a wonderful film.
[229:57.37]I've just never watched it.
[230:02.38]If you like it, it's amazing.
[230:05.24]What a story.
[230:05.92]It's fine.
[230:08.48]I'm not trying to be a contrarian.
[230:09.94]I saw something in you.
[230:11.92]Which is why I wanted to meet face to face again.
[230:17.70]Now he's cornered.
[230:21.12]No.
[230:23.61]I think it's a good movie.
[230:24.95]Get away from me.
[230:25.43]Get away from me.
[230:30.23]Alright.
[230:32.09]I'm putting my hands out.
[230:37.21]Putting my hands out in a T-pose.
[230:38.27]My fists are out.
[230:40.28]You want to go with this?
[230:41.72]I'm spinning very soon here.
[230:45.73]And if those two take a liking to you, that means you're the real deal, which is why I got curious.
[230:54.92]You're gonna take all 12,000 of us at once.
[230:56.88]Yeah, imagine me running in with my arms out spinning fast into a crowd of 12,000 people.
[231:05.22]I'm gonna hit two of you and then I'm going down.
[231:10.31]I'm going to hit one or two of you and then I'm turning and we're going to get one of those goofy movie scenes where a main character is running away from a big crowd.
[231:17.82]And it's just like, oh, geez.
[231:20.56]And I'm sprinting and the whole crowd is, you guys are like a quarter mile behind me.
[231:25.64]All running together at the same time behind me.
[231:28.96]And I'm trying to hail a taxi like, taxi, taxi, I got to get out of here.
[231:36.39]And with that, it's good to make your acquaintance.
[231:41.80]That's the Dead Rising spin move.
[231:43.48]Yeah, it is exactly that.
[231:46.56]It isn't.
[231:49.30]That's probably where I'm pulling it out from.
[231:51.90]That's probably where I'm getting it from.
[231:53.06]Yeah.
[231:55.98]And that move works.
[231:57.78]I look forward to it.
[232:04.47]Remember when you argued that time that Ant-Man doesn't control ants?
[232:07.35]It's because I didn't see the movie and I was talking as an authority on a movie I have never seen.
[232:15.49]I've never even seen the trailer for the movie and I was speaking as an authority figure on the movie.
[232:26.51]What a fucking weirdo.
[232:28.62]I'm no coward.
[232:29.80]I vow to you that I won't kowtow to Zheng Zhao, no matter how powerful his spells.
[232:35.18]Yeah, we'll bring him home.
[232:36.96]Dude, you had an Ant-Man shirt.
[232:38.80]Yeah.
[232:39.24]So?
[232:40.58]It was Infinity War.
[232:41.73]That's the only movie I fucking care about.
[232:43.35]You saw right through the Yellow Turban's tricks in the last battle.
[232:52.57]You're one of those volunteers, aren't you?
[232:58.78]Thanks to you all, we're seeing a lot fewer raids on villages these days.
[233:02.48]We've been wanting to show our gratitude.
[233:05.76]You'll be heading off to face the yellow turbans again soon, right?
[233:08.67]Then take this horse with you.
[233:13.39]Ant-Man's not in Infinity War.
[233:16.93]It won't take you across the realm in a day, but it's as tough a steed as they come.
[233:26.33]Yeah, he's not.
[233:32.01]He isn't.
[233:33.21]He's not in Infinity War.
[233:47.70]Oh, that's so stupid.
[233:48.94]Okay.
[233:49.70]Alright, I want to go to a town and sell some stuff.
[233:52.28]Where's the nearest town?
[233:56.49]He loves making stuff up to tell us little stories.
[234:00.67]Alright, can I sort these by type?
[234:02.27]I can, okay good.
[234:27.37]Do I have any plus?
[234:28.13]Okay, I have a plus four spear.
[234:44.06]Okay.
[234:49.68]Is it worth buying weapons?
[235:01.80]Because that's kind of a lot of money.
[235:02.76]It's cool looking though.
[235:03.78]I'm going to do it.
[235:08.90]That's like double the attack that I have.
[235:25.69]I have crunchies to break.
[235:38.59]So it goes up 1% every time you level it up.
[235:44.23]You missed the horse.
[235:51.64]Say hi to Paul.
[235:52.40]Say hi to Paul.
[235:52.94]What?
[235:53.04]What do you mean?
[236:04.58]You guys are fucking crazy.
[236:13.51]That's kind of amazing.
[236:18.69]Holy shit.
[236:20.61]So what's the point of keeping the other shitty ones?
[236:39.27]Yeah, attack strength.
[236:40.49]So there's health by 20%, health by 10%.
[236:48.70]Oh, is this going to end up like Bloodborne?
[236:52.87]Or I can have a few of these on at once.
[236:55.17]So you can get kind of two or three versions.
[236:59.83]So you can have 30% more health or 40% or something.
[237:14.24]Yeah, I'll take the defense.
[237:15.38]Looks like there's one more slot.
[237:19.67]Yeah, where's the horse?
[237:20.39]Did I miss it?
[237:21.01]How did I miss it?
[237:23.91]I just want to go sell some stuff and buy the new weapon.
[237:41.17]I'm no coward.
[237:42.37]I vow to you that I won't count out a jungle no matter how powerful the spells.
[237:47.74]Yeah, we'll bring him load.
[237:51.86]Oh nice riding horse allows you to move quickly.
[237:54.28]You can call upon a horse anytime.
[237:57.39]Oh cool.
[238:01.87]They say Lord Sun Jian is doing great things everywhere he goes.
[238:17.43]Alright, this is destroying people now.
[238:20.43]I love when you scoop them all up.
[238:36.27]You kind of vacuum them into a gravitational pull in the middle.
[238:56.78]He hit me?
[238:57.16]What?
[239:09.56]Can I kick him off the edge?
[239:17.65]Whoa, I don't know what happened.
[239:20.59]I'm locking on to two different people at the same time.
[239:22.65]This is weird.
[239:43.89]Now.
[239:48.55]OK, alright, whatever, just do it.
[240:09.02]please apologize to Paul what are you talking about in a 2019 VR stream he point wait what do you let me see in a 2019 VR stream he points to his ant-man shirt and says yeah he's a relatable superhero now I'm wondering how much of that sentence was pure lies
[240:53.00]I went to the Marvel database.
[240:54.36]I went to Earth 355, whatever it is.
[240:59.49]I looked up his profile.
[241:15.22]Chat, having a photographic memory of everything you've ever done for the last 10 years must be wild.
[241:27.03]And it is kind of funny that you guys just have like a... You have this like big scroll of every word I've ever said on camera or off camera.
[241:40.52]So nine years later, I could have a different opinion or like change my opinion.
[241:45.10]I just like, there it is.
[241:47.16]Or I could have been like, oh, but did I see Infinity War?
[241:49.34]I saw Infinity War.
[241:50.30]And it's like, wait a minute.
[241:51.04]Infinity War came out in this date.
[241:54.54]I didn't even like Ant-Man.
[241:57.75]You would get absolutely demolished in chat court.
[242:07.33]Oh yeah, it would be awful.
[242:12.34]Oh, I gotta go far away.
[242:14.90]Okay, hold on.
[242:15.46]I gotta go all the way back there.
[242:31.95]You've only seen the second Ant-Man and barely add that.
[242:35.05]No, I've seen them.
[242:35.67]I think I've seen pretty much all of them.
[242:38.19]Except, wasn't there a third Ant-Man?
[242:41.73]I didn't see Quantumania.
[242:43.09]Did I?
[242:43.43]I don't know.
[242:45.68]There's been so many fucking movies and TV shows.
[242:48.58]I might be mixing up the Ant-Man movie with like an old X-Men episode I saw when I was 14.
[242:55.96]I've consumed a lot of fucking cartoons and media.
[243:06.28]Keeping my weapon in good condition is the least I can do.
[243:23.63]Yet you remember none of it.
[243:25.05]I have some important info for a lot of you that are not.
[243:29.59]In your late 30s.
[243:32.39]There's only so much I've let's go.
[243:34.07]I'm going to repeat the thing I said like three years ago.
[243:37.90]There's only so much hard drive space for you to remember.
[243:41.14]And it's like kind of, I think it's like 15 to 20 years.
[243:44.66]You start like overwriting your brain hard drive.
[243:49.52]Everything that was 20 years and one day ago.
[243:53.25]It kind of starts getting overwritten.
[243:59.77]Why not?
[244:01.29]60 gigabyte Andy.
[244:02.07]That's fine.
[244:02.59]Some of you guys have like 500 gigabyte hard drives.
[244:04.95]I don't.
[244:06.87]I have a hard drive.
[244:07.61]I have like an old shitty one gigabyte thumb drive is what's up there.
[244:12.69]I can only hold text files and shit, guys.
[244:15.16]It's hard.
[244:16.84]I can only hold like text files and like a handful of MP3s.
[244:24.08]He has been imprisoned for refusing to give the attendants the bribes they expected.
[244:43.98]How many of your how much of your hard drive is taken up by the WoW classic talent trees?
[244:51.50]Probably a lot.
[244:53.02]Yeah, it's probably at least a third of all the data.
[244:57.82]He stuck to his principles and allowed himself to be condemned for a crime he did not commit.
[245:05.30]He is a fool.
[245:11.02]What about Diablo II weapons?
[245:13.83]The best part about playing D2 is you go back and play it every five years and you just kind of forget everything and all the items are new.
[245:20.15]It's like, oh, cool.
[245:20.85]Wow, I forgot about that weapon.
[245:23.11]What does it do?
[245:24.84]The corrupt officials are the ones at fault.
[245:27.46]There is no reason Lord Lu Ji should be blamed.
[245:30.79]It's like playing all the FromSoftware games.
[245:32.67]There's a period where after two to three years, the whole game, you forgot the entire video game.
[245:39.58]If I pick up Dark Souls 3 right now, I will know the initial two or three zones, but then the whole rest of the game is kind of... I just kind of forget the whole thing.
[245:49.77]Takes about three years.
[245:52.21]Those with power live.
[245:54.23]Those without die.
[245:56.23]Anyone who fails to understand this truth is nothing more than a fool.
[246:05.02]Cunning is but another means to power.
[246:08.06]Lu Ji failed to realize this and now finds himself a captive.
[246:15.01]What's your earliest memory?
[246:22.11]So are you one of the powerful or not?
[246:31.66]I remember taking a picture in the fourth grade.
[246:36.00]I remember my first day of school in the first grade.
[246:38.66]I do remember that.
[246:43.10]Yep.
[246:44.52]My mother took a picture of me.
[246:45.52]She's like, oh, look, it's your first day.
[246:46.72]Turn and let's get a picture.
[246:47.96]It's a big deal.
[246:48.50]You know, first day, first grade.
[246:51.98]I do remember that.
[246:52.60]I remember turning over my shoulder with my backpack and being like, mm, ma, okay, mm.
[246:56.18]And she took a picture.
[246:59.04]I bet you she has that picture.
[247:03.15]Maybe one day I would show it.
[247:06.70]You said fourth.
[247:07.24]Well, I remember taking a picture in the fourth grade too.
[247:19.84]Everything pre-first grade.
[247:21.44]Maybe kindergarten.
[247:23.74]Yeah, I remember a little bit of kindergarten.
[247:26.10]It's just flashes though.
[247:27.18]It's like I said.
[247:27.80]Once you cross the 20 to 30 year mark, it's
[247:36.77]like yeah little pictures like flashes and little video clips it's funny how your brain saves four to five video clips that are four to five seconds long from certain random periods over the course of your whole life and those are the ones that you have yeah I've got like two or three video clips of when I was like eight
[248:06.85]And if I fail to do so.
[248:14.71]Then the battlefield will claim your life.
[248:23.60]That goes for both of us.
[248:28.08]I wish my cousin Mike.
[248:31.30]Happy birthday.
[248:31.97]Hey, cousin Mike.
[248:34.01]Happy birthday.
[248:34.71]Make it a good one.
[248:45.52]Alright, I gotta pee.
[248:47.10]And what do you think?
[248:48.78]Peppermint tea?
[248:58.73]What do you guys?
[249:00.45]Peppermint tea?
[249:02.33]I've been super into drinking peppermint tea.
[249:04.77]I feel like, honestly, it's the only thing keeping me alive is peppermint tea.
[249:09.61]I've felt like that the last month or two, honestly.
[249:18.29]You know, sometimes you just do like, man, oh, this feels so nice to just sip on.
[249:25.40]Everything's fine.
[249:26.18]Yeah, everything's good.
[249:30.28]Alright, I'm going to be back.
[249:33.34]This might be like five minutes.
[249:36.46]I want to make this tea, so.
[249:39.60]Here come the BRB ads.
[249:42.82]Should I pause it so he's not just like talking?
[249:45.52]That'll do.
[249:45.96]Be right back.
[249:47.18]Alright, here they come.
[249:48.12]3, 2, 1, see you in 5 minutes.
[254:32.42]I got my tea.
[254:34.82]Let's chill.
[254:35.64]Alright, so this is a... This is a main mission.
[254:50.88]Recommended level 5.
[254:51.92]I am level 5.
[254:52.44]Let's do it.
[254:58.06]How many sugars?
[254:58.66]Zero.
[255:01.15]I don't put sugar in tea.
[255:03.68]I'll do honey.
[255:08.83]Like a squeeze of honey, maybe.
[255:09.93]Sometimes.
[255:18.36]Honey is sugar.
[255:19.10]Well, I mean like table sugar.
[255:34.77]Alright, so get all the way to the top.
[255:36.75]Protect.
[255:37.13]How many people do we have to protect?
[255:40.23]We must work with the government forces if we hope to bring down Zhang Jiao.
[255:47.77]Zhang Jiao?
[255:50.11]Zhang Jiao.
[255:55.70]Okay.
[255:58.68]Keep our own ranks tightly bound together.
[256:00.60]We can guard the rear flank of the government forces.
[256:03.28]Okay, so stay with the group.
[256:15.52]You're now just fighting the yellow turban leader.
[256:17.69]This game seems to be really extending this part of the story.
[256:22.55]I wonder if it's just more stuff to do.
[256:24.65]It's more content, right?
[256:43.16]Okay, stay with the group.
[256:50.52]Prepare.
[256:51.65]I got my new weapon.
[256:52.39]I'm good.
[256:54.89]I'm ready.
[257:02.39]A four and a half hour experience.
[257:06.91]Alright.
[257:08.41]I'm going to go right side.
[257:11.35]I'm going right side.
[257:12.09]I'm going to be weird about it.
[257:15.43]We will lead the attack.
[257:17.47]Punch through the enemy formation and secure the central stronghold.
[257:22.35]We march at once.
[257:27.30]I've gone A instead.
[257:28.66]It looks like Dong Zhuo's forces are going for a frontal attack.
[257:32.62]Then we will help them by destabilizing the enemy.
[257:48.17]You're almost done with the tutorial.
[257:52.53]That's actually pretty cool though if that's the case.
[257:55.03]A game like this is a game you just kind of pick up and just grind through enemies.
[258:01.55]What?
[258:02.01]Oh wait, can we get through here?
[258:04.11]Alright, this is probably a real.
[258:06.02]I think I just lost.
[258:06.66]I'm supposed to stay with the group and I did not stay with the group.
[258:20.48]Oh shit, they're like this one.
[258:21.86]I know we're good.
[258:22.30]We're good.
[258:23.39]Actually might not have been a bad idea to go this way.
[258:51.62]There we go.
[258:53.70]Alright.
[258:54.18]Well, this is good because then we'll get a bunch of reinforcements coming out of here.
[258:56.46]Why did I just hear you haven't actually seen Ant-Man?
[258:57.85]How is that slowly trickling through everybody right now?
[259:18.61]I've seen Ant-Man.
[259:19.67]Remember the part when the elevator opens and he puts his hand straight out and like the two million ants come out of the elevator and like go surround that guy and like go down his mouth and destroy it.
[259:33.16]I've seen it.
[259:33.68]Take revenge will not ignore your evil deeds.
[259:47.84]Oh shit.
[259:49.58]Actually, I have to start killing people right now.
[259:53.93]Alright, weapon?
[259:56.99]What is it?
[259:58.17]Ooh, I knew I shouldn't have bought that fucking weapon.
[260:01.73]I spent 3,000 coins on it.
[260:15.11]And I just got a better one in the next mission.
[260:17.55]I just lost $3,000.
[260:17.99]The enemy officer has been defeated.
[260:23.18]I've been waiting for you.
[260:53.56]oh my god that's a million people oh my goodness oh my god this is gonna be the same
[261:15.56]Alright, take out the office.
[261:33.89]Whoa.
[261:54.22]Alright, I got everybody.
[262:11.82]Oh, I caught him.
[262:12.38]They both have the same thing, cool.
[262:24.28]Spiders or ants?
[262:26.52]Spiders are very helpful, very beneficial, but so are ants.
[262:32.34]They're both good.
[262:42.16]still a lot of people here let's have our army advance the two spread out when do I get meatier alright stay with the group I don't want to leave anybody behind here dominate them
[263:04.13]That was just a presidential debate answer.
[263:16.38]Whoa.
[263:17.96]What's going on down here?
[263:19.20]Should I go help?
[263:22.59]I think I have to help.
[263:24.73]What's going on down there?
[263:25.57]Where's the... Oh, no, no.
[263:26.97]We're all up here.
[263:27.51]Is anybody down there?
[263:30.98]I think they're just going to start finally from the bottom.
[263:32.69]Okay, everyone's fine.
[263:34.03]We're all together.
[263:36.55]The audio is very crunchy.
[263:37.71]Is it crunchy?
[263:39.05]Sounds okay to me.
[263:42.39]We shall bring divine justice upon the animals who prey upon the weak.
[263:47.98]The weak are nothing but prey for the strong.
[263:52.10]And I shall prove that by eradicating you all.
[263:58.76]Both forces are advancing from... I don't... That was every direction.
[264:03.64]That was every possible avenue.
[264:05.50]I don't know.
[264:07.16]Enemies are just coming from over there.
[264:13.31]Uh, I gotta go back, back, back, back, go back at this.
[264:15.41]Turn around, turn around.
[264:16.09]Go away.
[264:16.75]Stop.
[264:17.55]Oh, that's not good.
[264:42.05]I didn't stay with everybody, I got too cocky.
[264:54.39]Holy shit.
[264:54.71]There's too many people.
[264:56.61]Do it.
[264:58.61]Nice.
[265:01.07]Nice.
[265:01.33]The enemy officer has been defeated.
[265:19.96]Is every single one of the generals right here?
[265:21.65]Did we lose?
[265:22.61]Okay.
[265:22.77]Alright, alright.
[265:23.97]I ran too far ahead.
[265:25.27]That was a mistake.
[265:52.26]Battlefield, what does that do?
[265:53.24]Yeah, that's the first loss.
[265:57.72]It's a replay?
[266:01.70]Oh, that's cool.
[266:04.70]After being defeated in battle, you can select recreate battle.
[266:06.88]This lets you take another look at how the battle progressed.
[266:10.88]Oh.
[266:13.33]You can also restart from a specific point in time.
[266:18.67]So how did this go?
[266:31.34]So I could probably just go back to this point where here.
[266:39.69]It went kind of bad here.
[266:40.57]I went too far ahead.
[266:51.16]OK, now I just go stay with this group.
[266:53.48]Where is the leader?
[266:54.80]Alright, stay with this whole group.
[266:57.45]I'm going to be this guy's personal bodyguard.
[267:15.36]This was the technique in all the old ones.
[267:19.77]Yellow curtains have justification for rising up.
[267:41.59]Okay, I just did a lot of work right there.
[267:45.60]I had to have done something.
[267:49.22]Where is... Okay.
[268:09.38]Is it only a lose condition if... What's the lose condition?
[268:14.20]Okay, so we just need to stay with Dongzhou.
[268:17.80]If we stay with Dongzhou, we'll be fine.
[268:19.62]We have full health right now.
[268:24.15]Take this!
[268:24.71]You would fight me then?
[268:39.06]Good.
[268:58.81]Good.
[268:58.97]Good.
[269:00.01]Where is he?
[269:01.73]Oh my god, he's getting the shit kicked out of him!
[269:03.83]He's getting his ass beat!
[269:12.00]That was a double.
[269:13.50]Still have two heals, right?
[269:44.17]How's he doing?
[269:46.53]Is he okay?
[269:47.01]Hold on.
[269:47.25]Oh my god, where is he?
[269:49.99]Where is he?
[269:52.75]He's getting attacked by two people.
[269:57.40]Holy shit, what just happened?
[269:59.76]Did I only just kill that one guy?
[270:14.88]OK, that now it's much better.
[270:16.44]OK, now we can move up, stay together.
[270:48.24]I feel like he just put on the medieval battle soundboard.
[271:01.31]There's a lot of weapons clanging together.
[271:17.65]Holy shit!
[271:18.61]Where is he?
[271:20.11]Oh my god!
[271:20.83]We're gonna get killed again!
[271:29.36]I gotta protect him!
[271:31.62]Just hit me!
[271:44.89]Take all the aggro!
[271:54.03]Good, good, good.
[271:56.95]Come on, pick up a health or something.
[272:01.75]Is every single one of their teammates down here right now?
[272:17.17]Where's my friend?
[272:22.64]What happened?
[272:35.50]Gauntlets can unleash an overwhelming number of blows.
[272:37.88]Ooh, new weapon.
[272:38.56]Cool.
[272:41.08]By pressing Y, wielders can take on different stances that have their own unique attacks.
[272:46.95]Very cool.
[272:54.82]Alright, that's good.
[273:00.18]Iron fists.
[273:00.70]Where is he?
[273:01.10]He's on his horse.
[273:01.90]I think we're fine.
[273:02.45]Can I heal?
[273:02.97]Is there a way to heal somebody?
[273:13.78]But he has such tiny HP.
[273:15.93]This is not good.
[273:30.07]Like I'm in trouble.
[273:33.69]Massive gathering of enemy soldiers can sometimes form a large force.
[273:37.87]Officers and soldiers of these forces will have high courage.
[273:40.95]I don't know.
[273:43.81]Huh?
[273:49.96]Okay, so just kill things.
[273:51.02]Trample them underfoot.
[273:59.41]We have 30 people.
[274:01.05]This is not enough.
[274:07.45]Oh my god, there's like 15,000 people here.
[274:09.63]It's over.
[274:10.75]There's no way.
[274:15.74]Oh my god, it's just a sea of people.
[274:28.42]He's going to die.
[274:29.12]There's no way he's making it out of here.
[274:32.98]Somebody just healed him, though, so that's good.
[274:34.36]Just got lucky.
[274:35.60]Oh, fuck.
[274:51.73]Oh, fuck.
[274:52.69]Oh, fuck.
[275:05.69]I really feel like I am playing Dead Rising.
[275:07.49]I'm doing the thing where you jump over them and jump on their heads.
[275:13.44]Let's get a thousand kills.
[275:35.89]There we go.
[275:39.38]Okay, this is epic.
[276:02.75]I have no health.
[276:05.17]Oh fuck, I gotta get out of here.
[276:11.89]Is there health anywhere?
[276:14.83]Oh no, it's over.
[276:15.64]I'm gonna lose.
[276:25.85]This is the most amount of enemies I think I've ever seen on a screen.
[276:28.41]This is like those mobile game ads that have like the 50,000 zombies on that are like impossible to render.
[276:34.28]Oh, please.
[276:39.02]Wait a minute.
[276:44.25]I won.
[276:44.49]Did I win?
[276:45.13]The enemy is attempting to execute a grand tactic.
[276:48.93]You can stop them by meeting certain conditions.
[276:55.87]Large-scale infantry charge.
[276:57.11]Defeat 200 enemies in two minutes.
[277:09.78]Get me the fuck out of here.
[277:13.70]I need help, help, help.
[277:14.53]A potion or something.
[277:15.43]Come on.
[277:18.41]I need a box.
[277:19.07]Boxes.
[277:19.47]There's got to be something.
[277:20.51]Okay.
[277:24.39]Oh, I don't, I'm kind of screwed.
[277:42.89]Geez, I can't do anything.
[277:46.69]The horse just ran over me.
[277:49.83]The bases have the health.
[277:50.85]Yeah, I, oh my God, I, OK, I gotta clear the bases.
[277:57.26]Okay, hold on.
[277:57.74]Wait, wait, wait.
[278:01.25]I'm going to clear this right base very, very fast.
[278:29.41]Okay.
[278:38.21]Do I get to keep all the weapons I'm finding or no?
[278:47.19]You only get to keep things that you beat a level.
[278:49.27]Okay, cool.
[278:49.95]That's good.
[278:50.27]Take this!
[279:02.69]Who is this guy?
[279:03.47]What are you doing?
[279:18.96]Alright, I got it.
[279:24.16]Secured.
[279:24.81]Alright, let's get out.
[279:27.19]I can come back here and get health if I need it.
[279:32.21]Oh wait, hold on, you know what?
[279:34.37]Try clear.
[279:35.15]Will I get more troops if I clear the other ones?
[279:44.83]Clear it.
[279:45.15]Yeah, OK, I'll clear it so I don't even activate this yet, so clear these.
[280:12.53]This will kill 100.
[280:27.94]I love the special moves in this game.
[280:39.65]They're really fun to do.
[280:44.74]Alright, got it.
[280:46.88]Okay, I need two if I can get them.
[280:52.16]One.
[280:52.62]Okay, good.
[280:54.25]Alright, so I have full healing now.
[280:55.91]I'm going to take out the... You know what?
[280:58.71]I'm just going to... I don't want to lose three times in a row.
[281:00.35]I'm just going to clear it all.
[281:17.98]You seen Lu Bu yet?
[281:18.87]Not yet.
[281:19.29]Come on.
[281:19.65]Come on.
[282:02.42]Should do it That's bad time to do that
[282:19.61]OK, there we go more morale.
[282:24.97]1500 KOs.
[282:25.51]OK, actually I'm going to use one because I want.
[282:31.60]Store a few are there any here?
[282:36.60]Let's go.
[282:39.14]I don't see any boxes.
[282:54.65]Are there no boxes?
[282:55.55]There's no crates here?
[282:56.47]Oh, there we go.
[282:58.33]I was like, what?
[283:02.87]Oh, shit.
[283:03.39]Does that stay there forever?
[283:04.13]I hope it does.
[283:04.99]I mean, I'm already down here.
[283:14.50]I'm just going to be 100% clear everything.
[283:17.36]I need the troops.
[283:19.86]There was like 10,000 people up there.
[283:21.39]I need more than 40.
[283:27.52]How do you say the word fuck?
[283:30.66]Hey, when you lose two times in a row at the same spot, you're going to have to kind of fix it.
[284:00.45]It's still in the air.
[284:11.19]Oh my god!
[284:19.60]Okay.
[284:21.53]I haven't... Yeah, I planned it.
[284:22.83]Alright, so now I got three heals.
[284:24.55]I'm ready to go.
[284:25.05]Let's do it.
[284:29.28]Let's go.
[284:48.87]Jeremy, can you look at my PoE 2 build?
[284:50.43]I need some tips.
[284:53.00]Um... I haven't been following PoE 2 at all.
[285:05.68]I played it for a little bit, but then... I just kind of... I don't know, I kind of... Something got started.
[285:11.02]I started to do something else.
[285:13.00]Okay, I have to pay attention.
[285:20.16]so it was huge we have no choice but to put a stop so we could be comments
[285:45.50]Stop that!
[285:47.22]Can you guys hear the clack of my controller?
[285:58.77]You probably can.
[285:59.57]Holy shit.
[286:11.94]Wow, that was kind of crazy.
[286:13.04]Don't get cocky just because I'm doing okay.
[286:18.09]I only have three health.
[286:21.79]Looking rough.
[286:47.86]I'm just trying to parry it.
[287:06.09]Oh fuck, there's too many people still.
[287:18.48]I gotta finish somebody off already, please!
[287:21.38]Okay, here we go.
[287:23.78]Oof!
[287:48.40]Like a stampede.
[287:53.24]Where's my officer?
[287:53.90]How are we doing?
[287:54.36]He's okay.
[288:04.93]Oh, come on.
[288:05.37]Give me my special.
[288:06.19]Come on.
[288:07.07]Come on.
[288:18.96]They're all so concentrated!
[288:23.70]Alright, now we can fight the final boss.
[288:41.56]I wonder if I should go get health.
[288:45.68]Oh, I don't have time to do it.
[288:59.07]Oh, get up.
[289:00.07]Too many people.
[289:08.90]Okay, come on.
[289:15.55]Damn it, that was a bad place to use that, I think.
[289:28.20]Ow!
[289:34.36]Go on, drop some health!
[289:39.22]thank you come on get it off yes the enemy officer has been defeated
[290:09.12]Alright, how's the leader doing?
[290:11.42]Alright, he's kind of getting his ass kicked.
[290:12.46]Hold on.
[290:26.38]He's getting bullied so bad.
[290:27.77]Please give me my special.
[290:42.31]Good.
[290:45.67]Good.
[290:47.13]Alright, I think we're fine.
[290:53.18]Gonna kill the last boss here.
[290:54.44]Did he just Mario jump over it?
[290:58.82]I think he did.
[290:59.68]Oh my God, fuck me.
[291:14.74]There we go.
[291:15.60]Just parry.
[291:16.06]Just parry.
[291:16.58]It's easy.
[291:17.34]Just parry.
[291:24.92]He's got so many guard on him.
[291:39.26]Holy shit.
[291:39.54]He's got like seven guard things.
[291:46.09]Is he down?
[291:56.48]Oh no, is it actually phase two?
[292:01.44]Really?
[292:09.14]I won, right?
[292:10.64]Oh fuck, did he just fall off and die?
[292:14.90]What?
[292:15.78]No, he's alive, right?
[292:16.98]Okay, I was gonna say, no way.
[292:19.82]Cool.
[292:47.52]I got gauntlets, yeah.
[292:56.40]Serpent stance.
[292:59.57]I'll try the gauntlets.
[293:02.59]Double seven.
[293:14.67]Do it again.
[293:19.56]Oh, that's a lot of... Hold on a second.
[293:25.21]There are negatives on weapons.
[293:27.45]Oh no, wait.
[293:28.11]Is that not a negative?
[293:29.37]No, that's a positive.
[293:30.37]Why is it red?
[293:47.62]Your horse even levels up?
[293:48.74]That's funny.
[293:55.59]That's a lot.
[293:57.45]Okay.
[294:10.18]What's the last thing here?
[294:11.10]This is... Restores health automatically to a set amount upon reaching low health.
[294:19.15]That's good.
[294:23.11]That's also good.
[294:29.98]I've never played it, but I've seen... I've seen Etalyx play it.
[294:38.01]I've seen some of the Crazy Moon Moon clips too.
[294:43.03]It seems very fun.
[294:43.87]It just seems very... I don't know.
[294:45.87]It seems like a complicated game.
[294:58.02]I'm going to go all the way down.
[295:02.51]That's a big deal.
[295:16.93]Encourage your horse replenishing some endurance.
[295:24.83]OK.
[295:29.80]Watching you play zombied would be excruciating.
[295:33.64]I mean, if I learned it off stream or something, maybe, but probably not.
[295:39.65]We have defeated Cheng Zhao's main force in battle.
[295:46.47]And it seems you've proven that you can at least survive.
[295:56.18]I...
[295:59.60]I hear both Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang are facing defeat after defeat.
[296:05.22]The end is near for the yellow turbans.
[296:11.70]Now, let me ask you, out of curiosity.
[296:14.68]How much longer are you going to be streaming?
[296:18.21]I'm probably going to wrap it up here soon.
[296:19.69]Probably in the next, like... I'll play with the gauntlets on one of the side missions and probably call it.
[296:26.11]What do you think Cheng Jiao lacked?
[296:29.43]Why has he been forsaken by the heavens, fallen from grace?
[296:37.81]Interesting.
[296:41.09]Why did you ask us?
[296:42.09]No, I was reading a chat message.
[296:50.06]So, he was not powerful enough to win the heavens favor.
[296:55.88]Good enough answer.
[296:59.12]It matters not what one's ideals are.
[297:03.68]Without strength or victory, nothing is accomplished.
[297:10.38]Were you ever into sneakers when you were younger?
[297:12.06]Uh, I'll tell you, you know what I loved?
[297:15.67]I loved, um, they were called, were they Nike?
[297:18.43]They were called Prestos.
[297:19.21]You guys remember the, was it Nike Prestos?
[297:21.09]It was so cool.
[297:28.98]Those are the most comfortable, raddest looking shoes ever.
[297:40.24]Yeah, I had the Bumblebee one.
[297:42.26]There was like a Bumblebee themed Prestos.
[297:47.16]And I had them, and they were awesome.
[297:59.06]Awesome is a word.
[298:00.58]I wouldn't use its nature I
[298:34.59]Prestos are still popular.
[298:35.67]I haven't really cared that much about the shoe fashion scene in a long time.
[298:46.01]I just get Skechers.
[298:47.39]I just buy Skechers and I wear them until they wear out.
[298:49.58]They last a pretty long time and they're affordable.
[298:52.44]The same type the yellow turbans use to create their illusions.
[298:56.94]But right now it's being used for communication.
[299:02.46]Follow the scent.
[299:04.89]There.
[299:06.55]You will find someone waiting for you.
[299:10.79]Very few people know how to use this incense.
[299:14.69]You would do well to remember that.
[299:22.14]You can lie, but you wear flip flops and socks everywhere you go.
[299:31.18]Depends on in summertime, maybe.
[299:37.84]Okay, I want to try these gloves.
[299:54.05]Palm strike, elbow strike.
[300:10.68]Alan Wake?
[300:11.20]Alright, how do these work?
[300:24.09]What the hell?
[300:29.54]Wait, yo, you freeze.
[300:31.40]And it's a parry, I think.
[300:33.56]Okay.
[300:40.55]Those seem kind of amazing.
[300:46.50]What's the regular combo look like?
[300:48.16]Okay.
[300:51.28]Does every part of the combo, if you press heavy attack, it's just out?
[300:59.77]Oh, wait.
[301:00.33]It's a stance and then you... Okay, right.
[301:06.19]That's pretty good.
[301:21.54]wait you can do you could do the Honda
[301:49.16]I would mess around with him more.
[301:51.04]I still like the sword the best.
[302:11.51]There's no way you can prove that this is not pre-recorded.
[302:13.55]I mean, there is no way I could prove that.
[302:15.09]You're right.
[302:16.13]I can't prove that at all.
[302:18.08]You just have to trust me that it's not.
[302:20.12]And that's on you to trust me or not.
[302:21.70]And apparently you do not.
[302:26.52]Okay.
[302:28.43]Alright.
[302:29.45]I think that's probably going to be it.
[302:41.32]I... the next plan to kind of... I just decided to turn it on.
[302:50.95]Saw this came out and was like, yeah, might as well play it.
[302:59.80]Did you have fun?
[303:00.42]I think it's great.
[303:01.14]I love it.
[303:05.02]I think I just got to the point of the game where
[303:09.04]You actually really do have to be a little bit more strategic.
[303:11.52]You can't just run up there and just kill things.
[303:15.28]Seems like it starts to get a little more challenging here, so that's cool.
[303:17.64]When are you going to play scary games?
[303:23.79]I'll play scary games at some point this year.
[303:34.09]Sims 2?
[303:35.25]I'll play Sims again as well.
[303:46.21]Indiana Jones.
[303:50.47]We're going to have an Omega Gaming weekend.
[303:52.57]No, no Omega Gaming weekend.
[303:57.55]But I will be back at some point in the next week.
[304:02.69]I do still want to do the Infinity Nikki thing.
[304:06.77]And the end of Nancy Drew.
[304:09.77]Because we were maybe an hour away from just beating the whole thing.
[304:16.74]Keep an eye on the sus.
[304:17.82]I mean, who knows?
[304:18.84]I might just stream randomly.
[304:21.55]I've been into it.
[304:24.17]I've been having fun just hanging out.
[304:29.81]So we'll see.
[304:32.32]I will talk to you guys later.
[304:34.12]Thanks for hanging out.
[304:35.30]Thanks for coming out.
[304:44.51]Why do you sound so defeated?
[304:47.64]I think you guys, some of you guys are not used to hearing my low energy voice.
[304:53.24]This is kind of the low energy voice.
[305:02.39]He's so defeated.
[305:04.05]Yeah.
[305:13.79]I'm just chillin'.
[305:18.93]Alright, take it easy.
[305:19.67]Thanks for watching, guys.
[305:20.77]See you soon.
[305:22.43]Keep an eye on the sus.
[305:23.38]Have a great one.
[305:24.04]That was a fun game.
[305:24.80]I like it.
[305:25.34]I might play it again.
[305:30.20]Who knows?
[305:38.54]I'm gonna get something to eat.
[305:41.18]Take care.
[305:41.52]Bye-bye.
[305:48.69]And call your freaking mother.
[305:57.04]Bye-bye.
[306:54.34]I just remembered something.
[306:57.11]Do you guys remember years ago when I would end streams by screaming and pressing the end stream button?
