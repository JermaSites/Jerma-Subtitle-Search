[00:04.71]Hey, what's up?
[00:07.09]How you doing?
[00:10.07]Welcome to a fun little afternoon.
[00:16.13]Today we are going to be playing Warhammer 40,000 Darktide.
[00:21.25]It is a sponsored stream, so thank you Warhammer for the sponsor.
[00:26.80]Drops are on.
[00:29.26]If you want to participate, drops are on for the game.
[00:37.25]This is currently the beta.
[00:40.33]You pre-order the game right now.
[00:43.77]You'll get access to the beta before the game comes out on the 30th.
[00:50.28]We got some friends in here.
[00:52.96]We've got Vinny.
[00:55.65]We've got Kryken.
[00:57.59]And we've got Charborg.
[01:01.09]I think it's going to be a pretty fun time.
[01:06.22]But again, thank you Warhammer for the sponsor.
[01:07.81]Let's get started.
[01:10.37]Pulling up the YouTube voice.
[01:12.24]You know.
[01:13.78]Let's see how they're doing.
[01:17.58]Um, and then like us calling the meeting exactly at the moment you were about to die and you run into the room.
[01:24.49]How the fuck did that even happen?
[01:26.77]I have no idea, dude.
[01:27.83]That was such a fun session.
[01:29.37]I really like want to play more.
[01:31.33]What, the Among Us section?
[01:33.06]Yeah, yeah, we were just talking about it.
[01:34.38]It was so good.
[01:35.54]It was really fun.
[01:36.56]But like, I don't know, dude, I put all my VR away.
[01:40.58]I...
[01:42.62]I just like... He sold it.
[01:44.57]No, I just like put it away.
[01:46.51]Salvation Army.
[01:47.83]It just takes up so much space.
[01:49.33]It's just such a huge thing.
[01:50.63]It turns your whole room into a different room.
[01:54.88]Yeah, once you put it away, you can't take it out again.
[01:57.00]Right.
[01:57.78]That's the rule, yeah.
[01:59.62]Damn it.
[02:01.20]Alright, well, me and Criken will just do Among Us again, I guess.
[02:04.86]You guys can watch it on their streams.
[02:06.58]It'd be fun.
[02:07.89]Snot has requested to join.
[02:09.99]Is Snot one of you guys?
[02:12.21]No.
[02:13.01]I don't think that's any of us.
[02:17.11]No.
[02:17.39]Did I get an invite?
[02:19.73]I did invite Ice Cream.

[02:29.69]Oh, there it is, okay.
[02:30.83]Well, we're gonna have to, uh... We're gonna have to... It says I don't have any invites.

[03:14.96]Oh, there we go.
[03:15.76]Okay.
[03:16.72]Wait, did somebody just randomly invite me or is that you?
[03:18.91]That was me.

[03:20.67]Who's Sploosh?
[03:23.55]That's you, Charm?
[03:24.37]He's Sploosh.

[03:26.57]Okay.
[03:26.95]Alright, there we go.
[03:29.77]How'd you get to level four?
[03:31.45]Am I level four?
[03:33.09]Yeah.
[03:34.17]I don't know.
[03:35.56]Oh no, that's actually a visual bug.
[03:36.80]I think it's level 1.
[03:38.70]It says you're all level 25 for me.
[03:40.94]What the fuck?
[03:41.52]It says we're all level 4.
[03:43.63]Oh, I see.
[03:44.07]It's a visual bug.
[03:44.59]Yeah, you're right.
[03:46.59]So, um... Is there anything we can do for a few minutes?
[03:53.07]Because I don't know.
[03:54.11]We might have to wait.
[03:57.10]We might have to wait.
[03:58.10]We can wait like 10 minutes if you want.
[03:59.90]Okay.
[04:01.37]So, how much do you know about this game?
[04:04.33]Yeah, maybe give a quick... I mean, I used to... Believe it or not, I was a huge, huge Warhammer 40k RTS fan.
[04:13.16]Really?
[04:13.74]Oh, massive.
[04:15.70]That's cool.
[04:16.26]I played as the Tau.
[04:18.56]I thought they were... I liked the... What's the hero for the Tau?
[04:22.73]It's XV... What's his name?
[04:26.95]I actually don't know.
[04:28.51]The guy with the flamethrower...
[04:31.09]My chat's about to explode with the answer, though, so I'm sure they'll know.
[04:33.28]And then I also played the... What was the... The Chaos... Not the Chaos.
[04:37.92]There was a different... Like the K... XV88.
[04:40.70]Yes, that's it.
[04:41.28]XV88.
[04:42.36]What was the other one?
[04:43.20]There was another one in that expansion.
[04:46.23]The Chaos Elves or something?
[04:48.31]Oh, the Eldar?
[04:50.31]Yeah.
[04:51.15]It was like the new expansion one.
[04:52.65]Yeah.
[04:54.87]The Dark Eldar.
[04:55.66]Dark Eldar.
[04:56.64]Yep.
[04:57.52]Yep.
[04:58.56]That was the other one.
[05:00.99]That's cool, guys.
[05:02.67]Did you play?
[05:03.65]Are you a huge Warhammer nerd?
[05:06.07]Yeah.
[05:07.43]Oh, yeah.
[05:07.83]What's your favorite army?
[05:09.49]It's definitely... I mean, knowing you, it's got to be... The Blimpticus.
[05:15.82]Oh, yeah, Blimpticus.
[05:17.20]Yeah, Blimpticus is pretty cool.
[05:19.72]The Blimpticus?
[05:20.52]Oh, you made that up.
[05:21.26]Okay.
[05:22.34]I was like, what the hell is the Blimpticus?
[05:25.35]He's flipping through his little handbook.
[05:26.71]Hold on.
[05:27.27]Blimpticus.
[05:29.07]I don't see that in my CTA.
[05:33.17]But yeah, so you get four classes, right?
[05:37.01]I guess we can, let's go over for real.
[05:39.45]There's four classes.
[05:40.99]And yeah, this is the, what's, what's, I'm the ogre, right?
[05:45.28]The ogren, right?
[05:46.90]There's also, this is like a melee short range focus character, right?
[05:51.24]Yeah, he's like kind of a tank.
[05:52.44]You get shields later on.
[05:53.68]You get like explosive weapons and a big old, like you have a dagger that's the size of like our entire body that you just swing around.
[06:01.06]That's cool.
[06:02.28]You just kind of wade into the battle and hold the line for everyone.
[06:06.15]Oh, I probably have some cosmetics, don't I?
[06:07.49]Let's see.
[06:10.07]Oh, I just have a green t-shirt.
[06:11.15]Yeah, I don't have any cosmetics.
[06:12.51]Yeah, I'm in my pajamas.
[06:16.44]so wait a minute the thing drops at uh in 15 minutes right the thing uh and exactly like probably I think 15 minutes now do we have to start exactly at that time yes okay then we we need we need to start a mission we need to be available at exactly 14 minutes yeah we're we're all good mental we're at the mission board uh Trevor what's your character's name um my character's name or uh my steaming
[06:43.05]Well, I believe I have you on Steam unless you changed it.
[06:46.67]My character's name is Snot, and before you make fun of it... It was him.
[06:50.91]We were trying to kick you over and over again.
[06:53.39]Oh, really?
[06:54.15]We don't know Snot.
[06:56.22]We were like, who's this Snot guy?
[06:58.28]Oh, on the lower of my planet, that means... I know it probably means something else for you guys, but for me, it means something entirely different.
[07:05.00]Oh, please do tell.
[07:07.80]It means runny boogers.
[07:12.13]Thanks for the info.
[07:13.11]That makes a lot of sense.
[07:13.93]Everybody have a good sound quality now?
[07:16.01]I think I'd turn some of you guys up.
[07:19.75]Every time I play a game on Discord, I always have to go through and just individually do all the bars.
[07:23.60]Yeah, everyone.
[07:26.00]Oh, maybe I should do the advanced training just so people can see what it looks like.
[07:30.42]Yeah, the advanced training would take you like five minutes.
[07:33.24]It's good too.
[07:33.84]You learn a lot.
[07:36.17]I want to meet up with you guys.
[07:37.11]I want to see you.
[07:38.47]I'm at the big little... I'm so excited.
[07:41.29]The mission terminal.
[07:42.55]I'm at the meat grinder just practicing my weaponing.
[07:46.30]Where is the training area?
[07:49.56]Left.
[07:50.78]It's like a big old... There's like a lady in a tube in like a circular room.
[07:54.80]It's called the psychonium.
[07:57.28]There's a lady in a tube.
[07:58.48]Okay.
[07:59.32]Yeah.
[08:01.68]No, that's a barber.
[08:02.64]Wait.
[08:02.96]Okay.
[08:03.38]My name's Carl.
[08:04.66]Oscar Carl.
[08:05.88]The guns are a little loud.
[08:07.10]Yeah, that's what guns do, chat.
[08:14.20]Don't tell Jerma where the meat grinder is.
[08:15.98]Well, that's where the training is.
[08:17.65]Go get a trim.
[08:18.93]Should I get the Bugleberry?
[08:20.09]Is there a map?
[08:20.97]No.
[08:21.13]I haven't found one.
[08:21.67]You just kind of learn.
[08:22.69]Oh, wait, I found a barber.
[08:36.91]Yeah, the music is pretty damn good in this.
[08:39.13]I have to say, I was playing last night, and I was like, oh, that music.
[08:44.86]I was kind of surprised at how much I enjoyed it.
[08:47.40]Yeah, I've been playing this game a lot over the last week or so that it's been available, and two nights ago, I was in bed just listening to Spotify and chilling out, getting ready to sleep, and so the soundtrack for this game is on Spotify, and it auto started playing
[09:03.35]the soundtrack from this game after I'd just gotten done playing this game.
[09:06.83]And my eyes literally went wide up like a Wokage emote.
[09:09.88]I was like, and I got up out of bed and went back to my computer and played for two hours because I was like so moved by the.
[09:17.42]It felt like it was like, I got to play this now.
[09:19.92]yeah it was it just you know the emperor called me and I had to yeah to respond to the call yeah at that point you had to I am very excited I've I've in the prologue there was some there was some music that was just it seemed like I was swinging to the beat and it seemed like it was cool yeah right so I'm very excited and I'm very excited just to
[09:40.46]It's potentially happening here.
[09:41.90]Jerma, were you a big Left 4 Dead guy at all?
[09:44.90]I was.
[09:45.26]I actually, I loved Left 4 Dead.
[09:47.42]You'll love this.
[09:48.24]Yeah.
[09:48.60]I mean, I played Vermintide.
[09:50.02]Vermintide was a lot of fun.
[09:51.42]Yeah.
[09:51.88]See, I had never played Vermintide, so this was my first experience of this series aside from Dawn of War.
[09:57.37]That's the only other 40k I've ever played.
[10:00.33]Yeah, so when I played this last night, I was like, oh, this is good.
[10:05.29]Yeah, Dawn of War, I was obsessed with it.
[10:08.60]Yeah, that was awesome.
[10:11.27]Yeah, so, Jermantide and this game both have, like, really, I think, well-tuned both gun and, like, melee combat.
[10:19.87]So, just the pacing of, like, fighting through hordes and pushing things back and then dodging out of the way of, like, stuff, it's all very readable.
[10:26.83]Is there any, uh, anything, where's the least amount of info in the screen?
[10:30.52]Top right, top left, bottom right, where's, like, the, where's there, like, no info?
[10:34.62]Uh... Are you looking for a cam spot?
[10:36.28]Yeah, I need a cam spot here.
[10:37.36]You should do direct middle.
[10:39.40]Yeah, they always want a middle for me, too.
[10:41.42]I think top right has been the least amount that I've seen.
[10:43.83]Okay.
[10:44.75]Yeah, or top left is just like the watermark.
[10:46.85]The beta test, yeah.
[10:48.68]Yeah.
[10:49.54]I'm ready.
[10:53.67]So you played the tabletop Jerma back in your... No, I played on like the RTS, the Warhammer 40k.
[10:59.35]Oh, the RTS one, okay.
[11:01.44]Yeah, I started playing through Vermintide.
[11:04.16]That's my first exposure to the Warhammer universe.
[11:06.40]And then I played the Total War Warhammer franchise, which I fell in love with.
[11:10.58]I love the voice work.
[11:11.14]So this is like my first big 40k one.
[11:13.24]The voice acting is always like 10 out of 10 in these games.
[11:16.80]I love it too.
[11:17.56]Oh, are we doing voices?
[11:19.58]Please, can we do voices?
[11:20.54]I love roleplay, please.
[11:21.34]Okay.
[11:24.74]I'll be my guy that I picked.
[11:28.69]My character sounds exactly like me.
[11:31.13]It's really weird.
[11:33.49]It is kind of weird, yeah.
[11:37.55]I talk like this.
[11:39.17]Kind of like Salt Spire from Vermintide.
[11:42.13]I was going to say, yep.
[11:43.83]That's a classic.
[11:44.47]Pernicus, the zealot.
[11:49.03]Vinny, why are you on the news again?
[11:51.41]Because I played a rubber duck game.
[11:52.75]I saw that.
[11:53.27]I saw that.
[11:54.05]I saw you on the news again, Vinny.
[11:55.50]What are you doing?
[11:56.42]Wait, what happened?
[11:57.22]Do you want to explain?
[11:58.98]Yeah, I'll explain.
[12:00.64]Uh...
[12:01.45]The reporter interviewed me for Trombone Champ, and then I explained it while I was playing Placid Plastic Duck Simulator.
[12:08.95]It's just a plastic duck game.
[12:11.39]And I said, I dare an interviewer to interview me about this.
[12:14.79]I was like, come on, news.
[12:16.69]We can do something like this, about this game where you just watch ducks fall into a pool.
[12:22.62]And then the interviewer from the previous segment emailed me and said, challenge accepted.
[12:28.78]and then he interviewed me with my alien on the couch next to me about this plastic duck game and that's literally all I was on the news for you know what's kind of funny nonsense yeah you as it go as it's going right now you are potentially going to potentially be interviewed on the news more than like ninja you know what I mean if it keeps going this way yeah just keeps just keep telling people to do it and they'll keep doing it
[12:56.04]I challenge anyone to interview me about this right now, this moment.
[13:01.30]Just me talking to my friends here in this call.
[13:03.70]This moment when he realized he was going to be the next face of gaming.
[13:08.13]You're going to turn into the face of, okay, who's the gamer?
[13:11.99]Alright, there he is.
[13:12.99]Let's interview him.
[13:13.99]There he is.
[13:14.43]He played that duck falling game.
[13:17.31]I played the Duck Falling game and other meme streamer bait games.
[13:20.76]And then I'm going to start getting people to floss on New Year's Eve.
[13:23.90]It's going to be great.
[13:25.06]Yeah, but you'll actually be able to do it.
[13:26.48]I mean, you live in New York, right?
[13:27.56]So you know the energy.
[13:29.28]I know the people.
[13:29.98]First, I have to go, hey, I'm walking here.
[13:31.88]And they know you.
[13:32.84]Yeah, they're like, hey, what's up, boy?
[13:35.42]Hey, applause for you, New York boy.
[13:36.91]I just came from Katz's Deli.
[13:38.39]How you doing?
[13:38.99]Let's do a little dance.
[13:40.47]Is the Hub World... Hold on.
[13:42.81]I'm being too weird.
[13:43.53]Procedural?
[13:45.05]No, no.
[13:46.15]Does the Hub World have just other players just kind of hanging out?
[13:48.84]That's what I meant, and I said procedural.
[13:50.34]Yes, it does.
[13:51.04]Random.
[13:51.36]Procedural.
[13:52.36]Just the wrong word.
[13:53.92]Procedurally generated Hub World.
[13:56.52]It sounded good at the moment, but it was completely wrong.
[13:59.54]Sorry.
[14:00.07]Think of how absolutely fucking annoying that would be.
[14:04.37]A procedurally generated hub world.
[14:06.11]And it's always someplace new.
[14:08.59]Hey, I can't find you.
[14:09.81]It's because our hub worlds are different, dude.
[14:13.41]Oh, yeah.
[14:14.57]I can't move past it.
[14:15.94]The blacksmith is on a whole other level.
[14:17.82]You have to go in an elevator and go up this time.
[14:19.38]That would be so annoying.
[14:23.06]Okay, let's see.
[14:23.62]We have like five minutes, right?
[14:24.98]We've got just about five minutes.
[14:27.34]Do you guys know the lore of this game or Hive Worlds in general?
[14:34.70]No, tell me.
[14:35.96]I could tell you.
[14:36.58]I'm actually quite the... Go on, Snot, then.
[14:39.02]Let's hear it.
[14:39.42]Let's hear it, yeah.
[14:41.92]In the year 300... In the year 300... There was the main character named Snot.
[14:50.55]Yeah?
[14:51.55]Yeah.
[14:52.98]He's sweating.
[14:55.34]Pressure's on now.
[14:56.10]I don't even know.
[14:57.00]I can't even begin to fake my way through it, guys.
[14:59.04]I don't know a single thing about Warhammer.
[15:00.70]Yeah, that's the worst.
[15:01.28]This man really raised his hand in class.
[15:04.08]Well, there were night elves, there were orcs, and they were undead.
[15:08.20]That's always the worst.
[15:09.72]They fought in Stormwind.
[15:12.34]Wait, is the year 40,000?
[15:14.72]Warhammer 40,000 means we are... Yeah, what is the... 40,000 is the amount of time, Pat.
[15:20.38]Somebody know how this...
[15:25.47]No, I think it's 40,000 years later, right?
[15:28.11]He was, like, desperately reading his chat for someone to save him with the... No, no, no, no, no.
[15:32.57]I used to play a shitload of Warhammer 40k.
[15:34.70]Okay, alright.
[15:35.52]Please, let me do this.
[15:37.08]Warhammer 40k takes place in the timeline of Warhammer, right?
[15:43.18]Okay.
[15:43.38]It's the four...
[15:49.52]The Milky Way Galaxy from human prehistory up through the 41st millennium in the Warhammer 40,000 setting throughout.
[15:58.39]Comparative references to present dates will be made with respect to the original imperial calendar used before the birth of the Great Rift.
[16:07.80]That sounds like you're reading off of Wikipedia.
[16:10.50]I think he just accessed the deep annals of his brain, dude.
[16:13.04]That was like... I just had to pull it up.
[16:15.30]Yeah.
[16:16.98]Actually, I like the kind of...
[16:20.05]One of my favorite.
[16:21.15]I love the orcs.
[16:22.59]They were awesome.
[16:23.67]Yeah, the orcs are great.
[16:25.24]They are pretty cool.
[16:26.82]I like them too.
[16:27.50]What was the main orc?
[16:30.50]What was his name?
[16:31.09]Gork.
[16:31.75]His name is Gork.
[16:32.49]No, no, no, no.
[16:34.07]Oh.
[16:40.03]His name... Grimskull.
[16:42.40]Grimskull.
[16:43.30]Yep.
[16:43.78]He had the chainsaw and like... See?
[16:47.72]I know.
[16:49.62]I know the song.
[16:51.22]When I did the Orc Massage video game, I included the song.
[16:53.98]I went, Orcs, Orcs, Orcs, Orcs.
[16:57.08]Oh, yeah.
[16:57.42]That's the song.
[16:58.42]Oh, that's right.
[16:59.64]You do really get around with the games you play between Plastic Duck Game and Orc Massage.
[17:04.28]And everything in between from Orc Massage to 40k, it's a duck game.
[17:08.26]Yeah.
[17:11.10]I'm actually very excited to play this.
[17:14.46]I'm so happy.
[17:15.18]Is this the first level you're going to queue up for?
[17:16.76]This is my first level I'm ever going to queue up for.
[17:18.94]Okay, this is going to be fun.
[17:20.16]It's going to be fun.
[17:21.46]Do I have to meet you guys somewhere?
[17:22.78]I think we just get pulled in, right?
[17:26.98]I think, yeah, once the board... We have literally three minutes.
[17:31.13]Are you guys ready?
[17:31.99]Three minutes.
[17:33.29]I'm excited.
[17:33.85]I don't know what is going to happen.
[17:36.93]I actually kind of don't know either.
[17:40.83]I know that something is about to happen.
[17:46.05]Now, is this something appropriate for level one players?
[17:49.27]I don't know.
[17:49.93]We will find out.
[17:51.88]Oh, that's a good question, actually.
[17:52.92]I'm sure we can handle it.
[17:55.11]Well, I don't... They spawned a mega boss.
[17:56.89]I don't think they would have... I think the party would have made that clear in the sponsor.
[18:05.55]I have this little prison jumpsuit.
[18:06.93]I think I can handle anything.
[18:08.58]Yeah, so they've been dropping new maps every few days because of this, like, rolling out into, you know, the full launch.
[18:14.40]Yep.
[18:15.38]So... We'll see what happens in two minutes.
[18:19.88]Well, chat, this is the mission board.
[18:22.05]It's not quite like Left 4 Dead in the sense that you just kind of go through a campaign.
[18:26.29]You just choose missions.
[18:27.29]They're like bounties.
[18:28.14]They're timed.
[18:29.34]And then you get money and experience.
[18:30.90]It's pretty neat.
[18:31.50]It's actually a very addictive loop.
[18:33.77]Yeah, and they have different modifiers that can randomly get rolled on them.
[18:38.89]So, for example, like Endless Horde.
[18:41.91]Another one I saw in the other beta was like Lights Out, where all the lights in the map are out and you basically need to bring flashlights to find your way everywhere.
[18:48.69]It's like a horror version.
[18:50.18]Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[18:52.60]Here we go.
[18:55.57]Here it comes.
[18:57.77]We have 60 seconds remaining.
[18:59.71]Oh, shit.
[19:00.65]Okay.
[19:01.31]I'm on the edge of my seat.
[19:03.17]Are there drops enabled?
[19:04.09]I want drops.
[19:05.03]How do I get drops?
[19:05.77]New war zone conditions in 47 seconds.
[19:10.52]Alert.
[19:11.10]Global condition.
[19:11.92]Alert.
[19:12.38]New war zone conditions in 40 seconds.
[19:15.06]I just repeated what you just said.
[19:16.94]Yeah, there's going to be a meteor that hits Tomato Town.
[19:19.42]Oh, not Tomato Town.
[19:22.78]It got wiped out.
[19:23.89]Alright, so give me a quick little tutorial here.
[19:26.09]What's the... Alright, I know F is charge.
[19:28.18]I know that I can do an uppercut.
[19:29.58]A tutorial with 20 seconds left?
[19:30.98]Yeah, yeah.
[19:32.16]It's time for everyone to get... By the way, I'm having a little bit of trouble looking in the chat here.
[19:35.78]I don't see anybody spamming let's go.
[19:37.99]I mean, what the heck's going on here?
[19:41.81]Maybe I need to adjust my glasses a little bit here.
[19:43.37]I don't really see it.
[19:45.17]I did that tutorial and the second they gave me like a fourth ability I can do, I just started just kind of pushing buttons randomly.
[19:53.20]I got a little overwhelmed.
[19:55.32]Oh, it's happening.
[20:00.28]Should I be seeing something?
[20:01.72]It's still pretty tame on my end.
[20:02.96]Yeah, the missions are gone and it's just quick play.
[20:07.06]What?
[20:10.54]Do we quick play?
[20:11.84]I don't know.
[20:15.24]I don't know what happened.
[20:16.86]Is that Disney Castle?
[20:20.10]Yeah, that's the Magic Kingdom, dude.
[20:21.98]So do we just do a quick play?
[20:26.05]The missions are rebooting.
[20:27.31]I think maybe we'll give it another 60 seconds.
[20:29.21]Because it's a very specific mission name.
[20:32.79]Okay.
[20:34.47]I put it in the chat.
[20:35.83]So it's going to be like Jarmopolis or something.
[20:38.27]239 hours we have to wait.
[20:40.24]That's enough time to talk about the lore of the game, I think.
[20:43.48]Maybe not.
[20:44.53]Actually not.
[20:45.09]Yeah, there's so much lore in this stupid game.
[20:46.85]Let's see.
[20:51.09]I'm a huge lore nerd, though, so I will talk as long as you let me.
[20:55.05]Are you actually like a big Warhammer fan?
[20:57.36]You are, right?
[20:58.58]Yeah, I only found it.
[20:59.94]Oh, here.
[21:00.46]It just popped back up.
[21:03.56]Power supply interruption.
[21:04.70]That's the one.
[21:05.30]Okay.
[21:06.84]Here we go.
[21:07.42]It's going to go at level two.
[21:08.86]Hold on one sec.
[21:11.11]Oh, no.
[21:12.09]Okay.
[21:15.19]Magistrati Obelette.
[21:17.19]Alright.
[21:20.11]Let's go!
[21:21.89]Oh, it is lights out.
[21:22.87]Holy shit, I actually connected it.
[21:24.05]Lights out!
[21:25.15]Wait, is it the power supply place?
[21:25.95]Power supply interruption?
[21:26.85]Yeah, that's what I was talking about.
[21:28.72]Wait, I'm freaked out.
[21:30.00]Oh, it's gonna be freaky.
[21:30.98]This shit's gonna be freaky.
[21:31.88]We need to bring the flashlight.
[21:34.71]I just have this terrible little sword that I found in the trash.
[21:37.79]I don't have anything.
[21:38.53]I don't have a flashlight.
[21:39.47]You'll have something, Snot, if you just, um... I'm, like, babysitting these pajama kids.
[21:45.62]I'm ready!
[21:45.98]The slumber party.
[21:47.38]This Lays gun has a flashlight, so I'll bring this.
[21:49.46]Alright, let's see if I got a flashlight.
[21:53.10]Uh... Oh, that'll be good.
[21:56.24]Wait, do we need flashlights?
[21:58.33]It's gonna be dark, man.
[21:59.39]Press I. Press I.
[22:03.30]and then click on your weapon, and you'll see an icon that looks like a flashlight.
[22:07.94]It's three icons on your weapon, and the right one should be a flashlight.
[22:12.12]Mine's a knife.
[22:13.92]Well... Oh, no!
[22:16.86]Ogryns are traditionally stupid.
[22:18.53]I don't know if you could know how to function a flashlight very good.
[22:22.17]What is your weapon?
[22:24.03]I have the default stuff.
[22:25.37]Just a cudgel of some kind.
[22:28.61]But it's like a makeshift club, it looks like.
[22:31.07]Did we naturally all pick a different class out of the four?
[22:34.77]That's cool.
[22:35.25]That's actually pretty remarkable.
[22:37.21]That's the first time I've seen that.
[22:39.94]Alright, here it is.
[22:40.90]This is the big moment.
[22:43.30]Oh my lord, you're massive.
[22:46.60]Look, he's counting his fingers.
[22:48.10]He's on his phone.
[22:49.58]I thought he was on his invisible cell phone.
[22:51.48]He's on his iPhone.
[22:58.62]It's the orc massage guy.
[22:59.89]Stop bringing up orc massage so that I don't have to say it in the call anymore.
[23:04.01]Let's give me your next interview.
[23:05.23]100%.
[23:05.45]This is us.
[23:07.61]This is us.
[23:08.05]This is us.
[23:08.39]Okay, calm down.
[23:10.01]How cool are we?
[23:12.45]We look great.
[23:12.99]I thought I just crashed the game.
[23:14.03]Alright, here we go.
[23:16.99]It's time to play.
[23:17.69]This is definitely darker than it usually is.
[23:19.09]Snot, Smush, Copernicus, and Vine.
[23:21.33]Dark top.
[23:21.93]Four of us.
[23:22.53]Are there Fortnite emos?
[23:24.71]Before we begin, guys.
[23:26.57]Not entirely.
[23:28.57]Sorry.
[23:29.81]I don't have a... Somebody has to be a flashlight lead.
[23:32.96]I got it.
[23:33.76]Can you see my flashlight?
[23:35.16]I can.
[23:35.66]Yes.
[23:36.56]Okay.
[23:37.12]Oh, I love the acting.
[23:46.17]That's a tomty.
[23:47.35]I don't know.
[23:48.63]It's like a numpty.
[23:51.27]What's the flashlight button in case they get separated?
[23:54.07]Mouse 5 on your weapon.
[23:55.35]We already are separated.
[23:56.84]Oh.
[23:57.72]What?
[23:57.88]Oh!
[24:00.10]Oops.
[24:01.90]Oops.
[24:02.74]What happened?
[24:04.20]There's some zombie friends down here, infected.
[24:06.60]Oh, it's fucking dark, man.
[24:07.78]This is really dark.
[24:12.00]Oof.
[24:13.09]Are these guys confirmed bad, or are we just killing random folks?
[24:16.03]They're heretics.
[24:16.89]They're heretics, and aren't they infected with worms?
[24:20.07]Yeah, they're infected with nerves.
[24:21.46]I can't see anything.
[24:22.48]If you look closely, they got pustules all over them.
[24:26.44]Pustules, whatever.
[24:27.82]Yeah, and when you hit them with a shovel, maggots fall out of their face.
[24:31.26]Really?
[24:31.52]That's gross.
[24:31.84]That's why you brought the shovel.
[24:33.24]I knew there was some meta reason.
[24:34.97]What's this thing?
[24:35.67]It's the only one I have.
[24:36.63]The only melee I have, but sure.
[24:38.83]Alright, you want to see some cool shit?
[24:42.19]Let's go!
[24:45.04]Oh, my boy's got a flamethrower.
[24:46.56]What?
[24:47.64]Yeah.
[24:49.42]I came to purge some freaking heretics.
[24:53.70]Feels pretty good.
[24:55.96]It is so dark.
[24:57.30]This is usually well lit.
[24:59.88]I haven't done a sewer level at all.
[25:01.41]Have you?
[25:02.51]Yeah.
[25:03.39]You have?
[25:03.97]These hounds will jump you.
[25:07.49]Did I kill him?
[25:12.42]Help me.
[25:14.24]I think a dog pushed me in.
[25:16.12]That wasn't intentional.
[25:17.36]I swear.
[25:18.54]Is Vinny the only one that brought a flashlight?
[25:20.66]I think so.
[25:23.00]Oh, my God.
[25:25.52]Oh, you can see them glowing in the dark over there.
[25:27.26]That's so cool.
[25:27.90]Look at that.
[25:28.76]Oh, that's terrifying.
[25:29.70]I threw a grenade.
[25:30.36]Grenade out.
[25:39.66]I'm chopping them up.
[25:40.42]I'm chopping them up.
[25:42.84]Ow!
[25:45.88]Oh my god.
[25:46.32]I keep shooting you guys.
[25:47.18]I'm sorry.
[25:48.40]I don't think there's friendly fire, right?
[25:50.22]I don't think so.
[25:50.98]There actually isn't friendly fire.
[25:53.06]They can just get upset.
[25:54.50]Like the characters are like, Oi!
[25:55.82]Watch what you're doing, mate!
[25:57.86]That's so good.
[25:59.38]I'm too much of an MCAT.
[26:00.22]That's what they sound like.
[26:01.18]Hey, why are you targeting me?
[26:03.69]Ammo if anyone needs it.
[26:04.67]I don't know.
[26:05.19]You gotta mix in some Warhammer space terminology.
[26:09.04]What you hit me with the blast the end of the head of this of the Slazza Slazza gun.
[26:14.96]Holy shit, I threw a box in that guy's head.
[26:17.62]What's the curse word that replaces fucking this?
[26:20.52]Grogon.
[26:23.04]What is it?
[26:23.76]That does not have the same punch to it.
[26:26.82]Someone in my chat just said dirty sci-fi is so cool.
[26:30.02]It is.
[26:30.28]You know what?
[26:31.36]That's a great way to describe it.
[26:36.03]Oh, my God.
[26:36.61]I just I have a brick as a grenade.
[26:38.73]It doesn't explode.
[26:39.55]So the Ogryn just throw off the whole box of grenades.
[26:44.40]They can't figure out.
[26:46.20]That's so funny.
[26:47.46]Individual one.
[26:48.20]So they just put all.
[26:49.50]Oh, there's a sniper over there.
[26:50.86]Sniper.
[26:52.50]I tried, but.
[26:56.76]Got this smush.
[26:57.42]Dude, we got to find some more flashlights.
[27:00.54]I can't see a thing down there.
[27:03.30]Oh no, I'm in trouble.
[27:04.42]I'm in trouble.
[27:04.82]Help!
[27:05.10]Also, they're suppressing us right now.
[27:07.82]I'm tripping.
[27:13.13]You have to get out of the way of suppressing fire, otherwise your aim gets all screwed up.
[27:17.25]Alright, where do we go from here?
[27:19.45]That ticking sound?
[27:20.97]That's an explosive guy, like a boomer.
[27:23.89]Oh.
[27:24.01]Jarmo, do you need grenades?
[27:24.97]He's just gonna run at us.
[27:25.75]Actually, yeah, I do.
[27:26.77]I threw a couple.
[27:27.21]Yeah, grab those.
[27:28.13]It is a lot scarier when you can't see them.
[27:31.86]Just listen.
[27:33.96]There he is.
[27:34.78]That light.
[27:36.08]Okay.
[27:40.04]Got him.
[27:41.47]Near us.
[27:42.95]I got you.
[27:43.49]You look like a monster on the ground.
[27:45.19]I need ammunition.
[27:53.67]I'll just try to keep my flashlight active, which means melee is not a good option, because then it gets too dark.
[27:58.73]What does that sound?
[28:01.05]That sounds like a horde.
[28:02.31]Yeah, it might be a horde.
[28:03.97]Why are there so many people down here?
[28:05.41]What are they doing?
[28:06.17]Oh my goodness.
[28:06.95]It was a rave.
[28:07.59]It was a Matrix Revolutions rave.
[28:10.15]Yeah, this seems like the best time of your life coming down here.
[28:13.07]It's been a weekend getting sweaty.
[28:14.99]Uh-oh.
[28:18.73]Music, guys.
[28:19.67]Music just started.
[28:21.63]I'm going to die.
[28:24.47]I can't even... I can't see, guys.
[28:26.15]I think I'm falling over.
[28:26.85]What the hell happened to you, snot?
[28:28.47]I think I'm... These guys pushed me.
[28:30.31]They picked me up and gave me a wedgie.
[28:31.51]These guys pushed me and fucking walked off.
[28:33.22]What'd I do?
[28:33.64]Oh, my God.
[28:33.92]Grenade out!
[28:35.90]Wait, where did Smush go?
[28:40.15]We are in trouble walk off the ledges We just need to find you okay His entire job is just keep it trained on the way forward
[29:00.28]This is actually pretty cool though.
[29:01.55]We need to do more arson.
[29:03.33]Does this level exist in the game?
[29:05.39]Like just the game right now?
[29:06.53]But this is like a wow that now you can't see.
[29:09.13]Pretty much, yeah.
[29:11.81]I think they just wanted us to be like scared.
[29:15.84]They were like, yeah, we're going to make Jerma scared.
[29:18.66]Have a dark environment for him.
[29:22.72]I accidentally ran off the cliff, yeah.
[29:25.04]We'll get you back.
[29:26.88]It's okay.
[29:29.69]What the fuck is this?
[29:35.08]What is that?
[29:35.56]I don't have a hemo.
[29:40.00]That was actually terrifying Smush are you okay?
[29:44.55]You're not okay.
[29:45.49]I'm just observing.
[29:46.93]Holy fuck.
[29:48.47]Help someone he's killing me so bad I don't even know what his attacks are
[29:55.71]He's just annihilating you.
[29:58.91]Help me!
[29:59.99]Help!
[30:00.94]Just fucking slap.
[30:02.48]Oh, he's so close.
[30:03.72]He's dead.
[30:04.12]He's dead.
[30:04.62]He's dead.
[30:04.92]You got him?
[30:05.42]He's dead, but we gotta get Snot up.
[30:08.46]Oh my god.
[30:09.14]There's another special.
[30:10.18]There's another special infected.
[30:11.74]What the hell is happening?
[30:13.52]That was insane.
[30:15.31]That was a real fucking demon.
[30:18.13]We just all got downed.
[30:19.49]That was terrifying.
[30:20.57]Wow.
[30:20.95]Okay, that was cool.
[30:23.44]Did we get to go back to the lobby and buy some things?
[30:26.10]I've got a couple ideas for supplies.
[30:28.71]Yeah, I'm going to bring a flashlight.
[30:30.61]We need flashlights.
[30:32.19]Yeah, for real.
[30:33.95]I don't think you can actually afford flashlights at the moment.
[30:37.89]Damn.
[30:39.07]You just really said that.
[30:40.33]I said that.
[30:42.07]There's a leveling system, too?
[30:43.82]Oh, yeah.
[30:44.28]Yeah, that's how you unlock more weapon classes and, you know, stuff in the hub.
[30:50.66]Full four-player co-op, by the way.
[30:52.26]That's a video, obviously.
[30:53.98]You can play it alone if you want to as well.
[30:55.59]You don't have to be with four people.
[30:58.77]That was very intense.
[31:01.51]The music kicked in, too, and that got my blood pumping.
[31:06.07]I've been playing this game for like 30 hours now over the last week and I did not I've never seen that entity That was the first that they just added them.
[31:13.67]I think right maybe that's what they wanted us to wait for.
[31:15.81]Yeah I think this is my eyes.
[31:18.33]I'm not gonna lie.
[31:20.15]I Believe that it was just like it's too scary lapsed on this floor with like this hallowed Frosty ground around it and then I walked up to it and it just animated and went after my freaking neck It was terrifying that thing was doing
[31:33.89]Like 10 attacks a second, by the way.
[31:35.85]Yeah, yeah, I... I have no idea how to deal with that.
[31:39.92]Can you show me where you buy flashlights so that maybe one day when I find a pretty little pain... I think you need to be level 2.
[31:46.96]Unbelievable.
[31:47.83]Alright, it's alright.
[31:50.81]We'll manage, we'll manage.
[31:53.35]We should do a level one mission now and then maybe come back to that one since it's there.
[31:59.25]Yeah.
[31:59.95]The goal of this whole thing is to beat that mission.
[32:02.72]Let's start with an easy one, right?
[32:04.30]Somebody get us Aquaman.
[32:05.94]We got this consignment yard HL 1736 mission, which we could probably do.
[32:10.24]That way you guys can level up and buy another weapon.
[32:13.63]Yeah, that was crazy, though.
[32:15.39]Alright.
[32:16.04]I was with this one.
[32:18.36]This is also a new map that just came out today.
[32:20.08]I think the relay station TRS 150 want to do that.
[32:25.31]What difficulty levels?
[32:26.33]Oh, this one.
[32:26.99]Yeah, we could do that one.
[32:27.83]That's cool.
[32:29.39]You can crack in.
[32:30.57]Someone said you can upgrade your health or like vigor.
[32:33.67]Can you do that?
[32:35.10]Yeah, so if you press I and then go to feats every five levels, you unlock basically a new perk for your class.
[32:43.07]And that's how you kind of build a you can build like a build for your your how your play style is.
[32:49.72]I gotcha.
[32:50.06]And that includes like, you know,
[32:52.27]More tanky, more damage.
[32:54.19]Oh, okay.
[32:55.83]I see.
[32:56.35]Yeah, I didn't see that before.
[32:57.63]But no, I can't do it anyway right now.
[32:59.35]But okay, cool.
[33:00.65]There are drops enabled.
[33:02.63]You guys have drops on yours too?
[33:04.29]Mm-hmm.
[33:04.79]Yep.
[33:05.45]How do you do that?
[33:06.87]You got to connect your Twitch to the Warhammer thing.
[33:11.30]In-game or out-game?
[33:12.80]It's on Twitch's dashboard.
[33:16.04]I'll do it another time.
[33:17.51]Can I get some of your drops?
[33:19.41]Yeah, just pull up one of our streams and leave it on.
[33:22.25]Actually, I'll do that for myself.
[33:23.95]That's a good idea.
[33:27.13]Wait, you just leave the stream on?
[33:28.70]Yeah, just leave it on in the background.
[33:31.48]Get free items.
[33:33.40]But I have to connect, though, no?
[33:34.94]You can connect later.
[33:36.26]It tracks your watch time first.
[33:38.96]Alright.
[33:39.32]Looks like I'm watching Jerma while we're doing this.
[33:42.24]Alright.
[33:42.58]Hey, welcome.
[33:43.54]Hey, Jerma.
[33:44.40]I'm watching you right now.
[33:45.48]What's up, buddy?
[33:46.96]Alright.
[33:53.53]We can see.
[33:54.03]Chat, I'll enable drops if I ever play this again on stream, and I probably will.
[34:00.69]But next time.
[34:08.56]This is much less scary.
[34:10.57]I think I just tried to shoot this innocent guy up here.
[34:13.37]Coming.
[34:14.43]Wow, what a hero.
[34:15.85]Look at that guy.
[34:17.63]I like that the door... Look at the... Look at the door handle.
[34:20.89]It's just a skull.
[34:22.85]Yeah.
[34:23.03]I need to get one of these for my house.
[34:24.93]So, it's not just a skull.
[34:26.99]Apparently, in the 42 universe, those are called servitors, and they're actually somewhat conscious...
[34:33.24]humans really brains still intact that you know they're basically programmed their brains to function for their purpose like opening the door to be a servitor that would be just a pleasant existence you wouldn't have a whole lot to worry about I know yeah you can find them like there's like one for like drying your hands in the uh in the bathroom there's like a hand drying servitor are we all here for your ai in this universe yeah well so it's like dune a little bit
[35:02.19]Yeah, there's a lot of really weird dark, like grim dark shit in the 40k universe.
[35:09.41]I know there's a God Emperor, which is also very Dune.
[35:12.21]Love Emperor.
[35:14.05]Game looks really nice.
[35:16.78]Yeah.
[35:18.78]Oh, Dave in my chat.
[35:19.92]I don't know why I said that.
[35:21.40]Dave, what option do I turn off for better performance if I need to?
[35:25.20]Ray tracing.
[35:25.96]You want to turn that off?
[35:27.14]Yeah, I turned that off by default.
[35:28.02]I was just wondering...
[35:34.19]Just wanted to make sure they were dead.
[35:36.33]I'm just checking.
[35:37.37]Good work there, Smush.
[35:38.08]Oh, got him.
[35:42.54]You have a flamethrower?
[35:43.80]I got a freaking flamethrower.
[35:45.42]That's pretty sick.
[35:47.92]There's a guy here.
[35:50.12]Every class gets a couple weapons that are unique to them.
[35:52.87]I have a slap.
[35:56.21]Are you kidding me?
[35:56.79]You have a big meaty slap.
[35:58.31]Wait, what's mine?
[35:59.17]Do you know what mine are?
[36:00.99]Should be if you have a button on your mouse.
[36:05.43]Oh yeah, I've got a force push.
[36:06.73]I'm basically... I'm basically like in Star Wars.
[36:11.24]So this happens a lot where the Ogryn of the team gets shot a lot.
[36:17.48]Yep.
[36:18.50]Because they're doing the melee and then I end up shooting them a ton.
[36:22.67]He's so big he's like a door.
[36:27.07]He's like a door.
[36:27.91]I am like a big door.
[36:36.98]You say there's not friendly fire?
[36:39.06]They just get mad at you.
[36:39.94]It doesn't feel like... What the hell is that?
[36:45.13]Wait, watch out.
[36:45.67]Be careful.
[36:50.96]You shot me in the back, lad.
[36:52.40]Jesus.
[36:55.80]The hound still freaking jumpscare me.
[36:57.28]I just keep shooting Jerma.
[36:58.54]Oh my god.
[36:59.46]Dude, me too.
[37:00.24]Why is it green fire?
[37:02.11]Oh, look at this.
[37:03.25]It's wildfire.
[37:03.99]It's the world.
[37:04.77]This looks so cool.
[37:06.39]This is beautiful.
[37:07.47]Guys, we need to unbolt this thing and take it home.
[37:10.73]This thing's probably worth a lot.
[37:12.07]It's probably 40k.
[37:12.81]Who's prime?
[37:14.81]These zealots, man.
[37:17.23]Not zealots.
[37:17.79]These fucking heretics.
[37:21.67]They picked the wrong god and they're just salty about it.
[37:24.26]Yeah.
[37:27.02]It's nice to know that things in the future are still very super cool.
[37:30.38]Oh, we're going outside.
[37:31.24]We're going outside.
[37:34.52]This is the first time we've gone outside in this game.
[37:39.55]Reloading.
[37:39.85]Oh, my god.
[37:40.49]I haven't yet.
[37:41.11]I haven't seen this either.
[37:41.89]Hang on.
[37:43.51]Let me just grab something.
[37:44.71]Got him.
[37:45.69]Look at that beautiful, beautiful skyline.
[37:48.87]Breathe in that fresh air.
[37:51.71]More discipline would not go amiss.
[37:54.08]Is it not the measure by which warriors are judged?
[38:02.04]I just have been following you around and hitting the thing that you hit again after it's dead.
[38:07.48]Okay.
[38:07.94]You know, you can... What happened?
[38:11.54]Oh, God.
[38:12.77]The lights are on.
[38:13.61]What is your excuse?
[38:14.55]A falcon picked me up.
[38:15.81]A fucking falcon?
[38:17.53]Yeah.
[38:17.63]I look like such a dickhead.
[38:19.01]I tried to peek over the edge and look down there, but it did not work.
[38:21.65]I keep forgetting there's a dodge.
[38:32.14]The dodge is so much fun.
[38:34.52]It's just... What's the dodge again?
[38:38.99]Space in a direction.
[38:41.07]Oh, yeah.
[38:46.87]Are there difficulties on the levels, too?
[38:49.11]Oh, yeah.
[38:49.71]That's awesome.
[38:50.33]So this is a level one.
[38:51.87]The one we tried first was two.
[38:54.26]It goes all the way up to five.
[38:55.40]So by the time you get to five ones, you got to be like, dope.
[39:02.35]Yeah, the highest I've gone is like a four.
[39:04.27]I love that charge.
[39:06.90]And they're pretty damn difficult.
[39:09.70]But really satisfying.
[39:10.80]Just makes you work as a team really carefully.
[39:12.98]But you also get better weapons as you go.
[39:14.34]Have you tried a five?
[39:15.24]Mm-hmm.
[39:16.28]You have tried a five?
[39:16.98]No way.
[39:20.52]Oh, you haven't.
[39:21.10]Okay.
[39:21.54]Airlock.
[39:23.92]Everybody in here?
[39:24.74]Okay, good.
[39:25.29]Yeah.
[39:28.17]I want to get some new weapons.
[39:30.21]So this is also a medical station, which we don't need right now because we're only on an easy difficulty.
[39:34.97]But you can heal on these.
[39:36.61]And every time you go down, you get this purple bar on your health.
[39:40.01]And that just reduces your max health.
[39:41.37]And whenever you heal up these, it gets really purple.
[39:43.33]Yeah.
[39:43.89]Ooh, ammo and stuff.
[39:45.85]And this guy's still alive, technically.
[39:47.26]This is a server.
[39:48.24]This guy's still alive?
[39:49.44]Yeah.
[39:50.54]Wait, let me see.
[39:51.08]Oh, wait, that healing guy?
[39:52.90]Look.
[39:55.58]He looks so uncomfortable.
[39:56.96]Oh, that's right.
[39:57.58]I forgot about that.
[39:59.68]I just asked us to take him with us because he's fucking lonely and doesn't think better to do.
[40:04.33]That's sad.
[40:04.83]Oh, God, what's happening over here?
[40:05.81]I'm getting killed, but you guys can... Oh, my God, I thought that was Jerma.
[40:09.25]I thought Jerma had picked you up and was smacking you, dude.
[40:13.55]Yeah, I was outside looking at the cool stuff, and then I see fucking a giant ogre.
[40:19.52]Yeah, they're all just staring at the medical station while I was getting on.
[40:22.24]Damn, look at this.
[40:23.78]I'm getting overwhelmed like sensory overload.
[40:25.80]This looks like Mad Max, dude.
[40:27.76]I love it.
[40:28.23]Dude, when are we going to get the Gugudas?
[40:30.75]I don't know what that is.
[40:31.99]I'm waiting.
[40:33.83]Is that like the Blimpkins or whatever I called them before?
[40:36.23]The Blimpkins?
[40:37.09]Oh, yeah.
[40:37.67]The Gugudas.
[40:38.62]No.
[40:38.82]Blimpticus.
[40:39.64]You'll know.
[40:41.04]This guy's played 40k, you can tell.
[40:44.14]Oh, man.
[40:44.52]We've got a horde.
[40:45.72]By the way, Guguda time, I think.
[40:58.74]Oh my god, that dog scared the shit out of me.
[41:02.28]Help me!
[41:02.96]That's not what we're gonna do with you.
[41:08.27]I need to stay on the back lines.
[41:20.26]Cast!
[41:20.64]Think we're good.
[41:24.62]Ah, get out of here, Heretic.
[41:25.68]Gather Thermoelectric Cells.
[41:27.34]Okay, we have to find Thermoelectric Cells.
[41:29.40]Alright.
[41:32.66]It should be near the Guggits.
[41:35.92]I don't know what that is.
[41:37.13]Still.
[41:38.05]Hold on.
[41:38.59]You'll know in just about five seconds.
[41:41.53]Two, three, four, five, six.
[41:46.65]Maybe, hold on.
[41:49.41]Maybe another five seconds or so.
[41:54.57]What are you looking for?
[41:55.61]There's no payoff for this.
[41:57.03]There's no out for this bit.
[41:59.45]There is, but I don't know if it's going to happen.
[42:05.75]I got one of the power supplies.
[42:06.59]You did?
[42:07.93]Yep.
[42:09.05]Nice.
[42:09.79]Where'd you find it?
[42:13.35]It was up top over here.
[42:14.73]I found one too.
[42:17.95]Nope.
[42:18.35]I'll just look over here and hope for the best.
[42:21.55]Oh, that one was on my map.
[42:23.64]Oh, over here.
[42:24.02]I got another one.
[42:25.04]Oh, you know, you got it.
[42:27.08]Wow.
[42:30.80]Fuck.
[42:31.14]Just wait.
[42:41.02]I see one.
[42:41.62]I see one.
[42:42.83]Sniper.
[42:44.13]Oof.
[42:57.43]I don't know.
[43:01.89]You guys get the other one?
[43:05.85]It's here.
[43:06.26]It's here.
[43:06.64]You guys are beating my ass.
[43:07.86]Ow.
[43:08.36]I'm coming, snot.
[43:09.54]Oh, I'm coming.
[43:10.76]Did we ever resolve that go-go-to bit?
[43:13.90]Not yet.
[43:14.80]Maybe in a minute.
[43:15.65]Oh, we got a lot.
[43:16.29]There's a lot.
[43:16.83]There's a lot.
[43:17.25]Go long.
[43:18.76]Throw it!
[43:20.58]My grandfather used to call zucchini gooboots.
[43:24.18]It's not a zucchini.
[43:26.06]No, I know, but... Yeah.
[43:29.62]The thing that I'm waiting for is not a zucchini.
[43:33.98]Did you doordash a zucchini?
[43:35.34]Is that what you said?
[43:37.41]Did you doordash a single zucchini to your house?
[43:39.33]That makes me so fucked up.
[43:42.51]Dog.
[43:42.95]Help, dog.
[43:43.93]Help.
[43:45.19]Doordash a zucchini.
[43:48.70]It's not.
[43:49.00]What the hell?
[43:49.36]It's like door dashing one single Gatorade.
[43:51.66]It's like, come on, man.
[43:56.40]You drink the whole thing.
[43:57.50]You open the door and grab it and drink the whole thing in front of them.
[44:01.38]Chuck E. Cheese pizza once for my birthday.
[44:03.30]Last one's over here.
[44:04.74]Oh, that's nice.
[44:06.04]Yeah.
[44:06.38]My chat got to customize what was on it, and they put every topping, and it cost $80.
[44:10.52]Oh, Jesus.
[44:11.92]Wait, what?
[44:13.06]That's clown pizza at that point.
[44:15.00]Yeah, it was terrible.
[44:15.91]They put little diamonds on it.
[44:18.04]They put little sardines and they put, uh, I don't know, the rest of the toppings.
[44:25.24]Do we go through this?
[44:25.82]Do you even eat sardines?
[44:27.14]Yeah, then we go through it now.
[44:30.51]Oh, behind us.
[44:31.39]What?
[44:32.49]Oh!
[44:34.45]Throwing a grenade.
[44:35.35]Start it back up.
[44:36.71]Grind him up.
[44:37.99]Yeah, seriously.
[44:40.43]Oh, that wasn't so bad.
[44:42.12]Ah!
[44:45.39]Don't forget that you can tag special enemies to make it easier for everyone to see.
[44:48.85]Oh, middle mouse alone.
[44:50.50]Oh, good job, Char.
[44:52.86]You implemented it.
[44:55.96]I love that overhead smash.
[44:56.92]I'm like a sponge.
[44:58.96]I mean, snot.
[44:59.58]Sorry, snot.
[45:00.86]I'll call you snot.
[45:03.84]Alright.
[45:08.60]So you say we're playing on easy right now?
[45:10.66]Yeah, this is the easiest difficulty.
[45:11.94]Wow.
[45:12.24]Alright.
[45:12.62]This is...
[45:13.89]This has got some... I think difficulty is actually dependent on each person.
[45:18.69]I think I set mine a little higher.
[45:20.39]Oh yeah.
[45:20.65]Which is why I'm dying so much.
[45:22.65]Oh, I see.
[45:23.91]Oops.
[45:24.43]That explains it.
[45:27.48]Who has the flamethrower?
[45:28.38]That's awesome.
[45:29.70]That's me.
[45:30.28]The zealots.
[45:31.22]Bastard here.
[45:33.08]Whoa, okay.
[45:36.52]I mean, you know, they're all bastards.
[45:46.23]No, not quite.
[45:56.82]Oh my goodness.
[45:57.38]The melee range is much longer than you think, says a chat member.
[46:00.12]Okay.
[46:03.04]Oh!
[46:03.86]Yeah, dodging and blocking is your friend.
[46:05.80]Yeah, it is.
[46:06.28]You can also hold right-click and then left-click to push.
[46:10.56]Oh yeah, and then you get a special attack after that too.
[46:12.92]Yeah.
[46:13.79]They told me all this.
[46:14.67]I just can't remember it all.
[46:16.71]Yes.
[46:16.99]I need to take notes.
[46:17.99]I need to write this down on the palm of my hand so I can... Do you guys see this?
[46:23.08]What is it?
[46:24.78]Like, one of them is just stretchy.
[46:27.06]It looks like Pokémon Violet.
[46:30.26]We just killed, like, 50 of them.
[46:32.78]Yeah, but one of them got real stretchy.
[46:36.02]That's alright.
[46:36.64]It's fine.
[46:37.39]It's the chaos corruption.
[46:38.93]Chaos.
[46:39.27]Yeah, a little corruption.
[46:43.03]Oh.
[46:44.37]We're gonna stay together.
[46:46.53]Low-hanging Pokémon joke.
[46:47.87]I don't think it does anything.
[46:48.83]There's a lot of view distance.
[46:52.39]Can we click this?
[46:53.11]I don't think this is a button.
[46:55.69]My character just declared, I have found a switch.
[46:58.09]I have found the switch.
[47:00.73]Alright.
[47:02.06]Enter.
[47:02.54]Is this...
[47:06.52]What's this over here?
[47:07.40]Small Plasteel?
[47:08.78]What's Plasteel?
[47:09.44]Is that just money to buy stuff?
[47:10.44]That's a flamer, and they have the best sound effect in the game in my opinion.
[47:13.38]It's the sound of like a fucking gas stove turning on.
[47:16.10]Like the right before they fire.
[47:18.52]Oh, that's cool.
[47:19.15]Do we have to bring something over there?
[47:22.55]The sound design in this is incredible.
[47:26.39]Uh, maybe Plasteel is currency for crafting.
[47:27.51]I've not done this level before, so.
[47:29.05]I wonder if there's a, I guess, do we have to kill anything, or maybe it's bugged.
[47:34.22]It says enter station.
[47:36.06]It's probably just one of these side paths.
[47:38.66]Maybe up?
[47:41.96]Oh.
[47:42.26]Also, I called the Psyker a freak.
[47:44.57]A freak.
[47:45.03]Yeah, I heard that.
[47:45.61]Yeah, so that was... It's not... It's very nice to be working on a team where people just are shitty with each other.
[47:52.59]Oh, here we go.
[47:55.89]Yeah, this is it.
[48:00.49]I'll take care of that.
[48:03.80]Yeah, it's interesting because I was playing this yesterday.
[48:06.35]I was like, oh man, there's no map button.
[48:07.95]I've gotten so used to having map buttons that I'm always opening.
[48:11.61]And yet, I had almost no problem navigating the levels.
[48:15.67]I feel like they're pretty...
[48:18.40]They seem vast, but you know where to go.
[48:21.02]That's the way I described it.
[48:23.23]They also have little weenies here, like this freaking little arrow.
[48:29.31]That guy was aiming at you, and then he pulled his sword out instead.
[48:31.73]Just trying to see where to go.
[48:34.03]Couldn't make it with mine, and that's what did a man in the end.
[48:37.37]Oh, there's healing here.
[48:38.09]So it's not.
[48:39.47]And me could use this.
[48:40.43]It's not only one lot.
[48:42.49]What is the purpose?
[48:43.41]One slot left?
[48:44.03]Yes.
[48:44.25]The purple is that your max health reduced because the amount of times you've gone down.
[48:47.76]And when you feel like this, it'll it'll fix it.
[48:51.10]So this fixes it.
[48:51.82]Yeah, there you go.
[48:53.90]There you go.
[48:54.34]You guys, I noticed you didn't think the the medical station man, which is a little rude.
[48:59.76]He hasn't he hasn't spoken to somebody in like six years.
[49:02.56]He just sits in this little thing.
[49:04.56]I got behind you Johnny cab oh my god what the was that that guy just died god there's a lot of detail yeah I was going to say this is immense if I would say immensely detailed
[49:28.72]I like all the clutter.
[49:29.90]It really just feels so claustrophobic.
[49:32.68]And this is the level that's outside.
[49:34.04]Like, every other level, you're, like, constantly indoors.
[49:38.50]I kind of want to see.
[49:40.25]Maybe this is not a great idea.
[49:41.47]I kind of want to see what this looks like with ray tracing on high for a second.
[49:45.37]Should I go in here?
[49:45.97]We're going in.
[49:51.45]I love the slap.
[49:53.23]Hello.
[49:54.01]The sound of it's so good, too, right?
[49:55.37]The flop.
[49:56.41]Hello.
[49:58.96]can you guys hear me yeah you're ray tracing on my uh game crashed oh no yeah see that's the ray tracing man I've tried to warn you you can reconnect yeah that's good thankfully
[50:18.98]Someone said what the fuck did he expect I expected ray tracing to turn on Dude, if you turn one of the known bugs I think is ray tracing If you turn ray tracing on in general like in the middle of any game you get your computer just kind of goes like I should have known it's not like it's the first time in the first game, but yeah Aren't they doing a bunch of stability patches too?
[50:41.83]Yeah, that's good.
[50:43.79]That's good.
[50:46.47]Yeah, this is still the beta, by the way.
[50:48.41]So it's, what, the 30th is when the game actually launches, right?
[50:52.30]Yeah, it's coming up.
[50:53.60]If you pre-order it, you get access to the beta.
[50:55.74]Game comes out on the 30th.
[51:00.18]Wait, get away from the barrel.
[51:01.20]I accidentally hit that.
[51:03.38]Oh, I'm sorry.
[51:05.17]Oh, this is a bot.
[51:06.13]Oh, wait, this is who Vinny was.
[51:07.65]Okay.
[51:08.83]What happened?
[51:09.57]Are you alright?
[51:11.14]What's wrong with you?
[51:14.94]What happened to you?
[51:17.26]I thought it was this guy with the hair.
[51:19.76]This guy with the hair, this is me.
[51:20.92]I'm Copernicus.
[51:21.52]I know, but I turned around and I saw a funny haircut and I was like, I have to hit this person.
[51:26.46]You look like Count Olaf.
[51:28.46]Okay.
[51:30.34]Who's Count Olaf?
[51:31.98]You don't know who Count Olaf is?
[51:37.20]Count Owa from Bad Time Bad Luck.
[51:41.61]What's the name of the show?
[51:42.97]Yeah, Bad Luck Bad Time is the name of it.
[51:45.77]Lemony Snicket presents Bad Luck Bad Time.
[51:48.91]Jiminy Cricket.
[51:51.58]Hey, I'm back everyone.
[51:53.12]Hey, welcome back.
[51:55.62]You didn't miss much.
[51:58.24]Okay.
[51:59.07]Did these explode?
[52:00.41]I'm not going to try it.
[52:02.16]You ever do this?
[52:02.58]Oh, damn.
[52:03.00]You look crazy.
[52:05.86]Oh, wait.
[52:06.08]Are we leaving without Vinny?
[52:07.72]You ever do this in school?
[52:08.34]No, I just was checking my options.
[52:09.62]You wobble it like this to make it look like it's made of rubber?
[52:12.16]Yep.
[52:12.76]Yeah, I've done that.
[52:13.54]Oh, yeah.
[52:14.51]Is my sword doing it?
[52:16.61]People used to think I was a warlock in second grade when I figured that one out.
[52:20.67]Yeah, I got all the ladies with it.
[52:22.97]Do you remember the origami?
[52:24.21]Well, not origami, but you'd make like a thing where you could tell fortunes, where you'd open it up like a piece of paper.
[52:30.17]Yeah.
[52:31.80]Now, how about this?
[52:33.32]Rubber pencil, origami paper, and you draw the crazy S on it.
[52:39.38]That's too much.
[52:40.44]I think that would, that would blow the mind of a, of a, of a giant.
[52:44.92]Purge the demonic world.
[52:45.84]That's too crazy.
[52:46.86]Yeah, yeah.
[52:48.40]Darktide.
[52:50.91]Oh, God, what is that?
[52:51.65]Oh, my God.
[52:53.73]This thing's like coming out of the wall.
[53:00.90]I thought that was the character very close in my character's ear when you just did that.
[53:04.82]Aw, thanks, I guess.
[53:07.32]That was actually, that was phenomenal.
[53:09.11]It just crawls up to your ear.
[53:11.13]This is!
[53:11.39]Oh, this thing has a face!
[53:20.43]These dudes do this is freaky.
[53:22.65]What is this thing?
[53:26.77]What I do The eye and now I'm gonna use that purge more girl.
[53:32.69]Oh the music's gonna kick in now.
[53:34.43]It's sick.
[53:36.12]I Think this is the song that woke me up from bed.
[53:37.76]I was in it and this song came on and my eyes went wide open I have no choice but to get up and play too.
[53:43.30]Yeah dog.
[53:44.40]Oh
[53:54.05]Dog.
[53:54.71]Dog.
[53:55.79]It went through a wall.
[53:59.11]Dog.
[53:59.39]It came from a... We got to be careful up here.
[54:01.93]These holes in the walls up there.
[54:04.72]Those vents?
[54:05.86]They spawn... Oh, God.
[54:06.96]That's a little sus.
[54:07.82]But they spawn... What is this?
[54:09.96]Yeah, it's gross.
[54:10.58]Oh, look at this face.
[54:11.52]This is so cool.
[54:12.88]I mean, it's heresy, but... I've heard a lot about it.
[54:16.18]In the face.
[54:17.55]Oh, there it is.
[54:24.32]I love how you're using a shovel.
[54:26.74]No, do not take that home with you, man.
[54:29.92]It's like black mold, but actual sentient chaos god.
[54:36.86]That looks so friendly, though.
[54:38.04]This on the hard difficulties would probably be very, very difficult.
[54:41.48]It is so fun on the hard difficulties, man.
[54:44.32]We got to try it.
[54:46.64]We should really try it.
[54:48.10]Grab that when you can, your health.
[54:50.06]There's a health thing I tagged.
[54:54.38]A little laser gun you got.
[55:01.62]You might get one.
[55:03.78]You might be able to unlock one.
[55:09.17]Do you not have any guns, Jerma?
[55:11.05]No, I have one gun.
[55:12.25]It's a one-shot shotgun.
[55:14.43]Oh, gotcha.
[55:15.15]How did you get up there?
[55:16.96]I walked.
[55:17.32]Is there a staircase or a ladder?
[55:21.12]it's a staircase oh I see yeah evil carnival music maybe a little bit what sort of carnivals you go to I don't know like demonic ones like a church yeah the now now it's like church carnival that's what I'm waiting for
[55:45.76]There's actually a song in the playlist that sounds identical to that.
[55:49.28]Do you guys remember one of my favorite parts of Vermintide, which is the other game like this, right?
[55:55.37]Was when the rats would spawn, it would be like, and then they would start charging.
[56:02.51]Yeah.
[56:02.91]That was awesome.
[56:04.41]You can hear them chanting as part of it.
[56:07.99]Not that.
[56:10.08]It was actually kind of like that.
[56:11.80]It was kind of like that?
[56:12.78]Yeah.
[56:13.02]It was cool.
[56:15.67]I like how, Jeremy, your community's memes have infected my community's memes.
[56:20.99]Like, +2, -2, rats.
[56:23.91]It's, yeah.
[56:25.03]Gas.
[56:26.15]They've got a lot of good ones from you.
[56:28.29]The gas.
[56:31.81]That's cool.
[56:32.39]I like that.
[56:33.93]That's fun.
[56:38.12]What's the lore on these statues, Copernicus?
[56:41.72]Uh...
[56:43.91]I'm gonna start answering and you're gonna interrupt me or something or like I'm just curious Oh, well, that's actually the God ever which we all serve and they are every waking moment as the audio audio good Hey guy here everybody Okay
[57:10.31]Can that big guy pick up our big guy?
[57:12.91]Oh, yeah.
[57:13.85]Just pinned him to the ground.
[57:14.95]Oh, yeah.
[57:15.21]He got me.
[57:16.35]Oh, that's freaky.
[57:18.52]Oh, that's freaky.
[57:20.34]I'll be saying that a whole lot down here.
[57:26.94]Guys, ammo here.
[57:27.70]Anyone need some?
[57:29.14]I think on easy, it's probably pretty... I am in need of ammo.
[57:33.06]Help yourself.
[57:35.03]Ooh, it's full.
[57:35.79]This is a good stash you got here.
[57:37.57]That's a good ammo right there.
[57:38.43]Yeah, I found this.
[57:40.65]Ooh, there goes his head.
[57:46.07]There's no safety hazard signs on this.
[57:47.93]I would stick my hand in that.
[57:49.99]Oh, I'd probably be able to help myself in this universe.
[57:53.13]It would be snot sausage.
[57:54.95]That would be dangerous.
[57:58.71]Yo, this guy's mad chillin', look.
[58:00.61]...a mere suspicion of mutation.
[58:05.90]I knew I wasn't going to do it.
[58:11.04]I wasn't going to do it.
[58:11.82]Somebody else did.
[58:12.36]I had to.
[58:12.94]I had to.
[58:14.84]Took his head off.
[58:15.74]The thing is, I'm kind of confused.
[58:18.58]On the map, it's giving us directions, but I don't know which way this is trying to get us to go.
[58:22.22]This is like a bug.
[58:24.63]Wait, how do you see the map?
[58:26.37]I don't think there's... Is this the only way to go?
[58:30.07]It's just up.
[58:30.93]We just got to go up.
[58:32.63]This looks amazing.
[58:33.59]Look at this.
[58:35.29]Oh, wow.
[58:35.85]No hazard signs on anything.
[58:41.40]This is an OSHA violation.
[58:43.84]The guy, weird guy.
[58:45.62]Weird guy over here.
[58:47.08]Get out of here.
[58:52.56]Got a weird guy here.
[58:53.70]That machinery is like, I would lose a hand to that.
[58:56.43]I would lose probably one or two.
[59:00.03]This is... Everything here looks so dangerous.
[59:05.73]Meaty and dangerous.
[59:06.75]Yeah.
[59:09.05]There's the face.
[59:10.89]There it is.
[59:13.09]Whoa.
[59:13.67]Nice.
[59:15.82]Realizing the state of relay.
[59:22.90]I love the combos you can do.
[59:23.96]I can slap, light swing, heavy swing.
[59:26.58]It's fun.
[59:27.60]Yeah.
[59:28.96]So some of the other weapons too, like I'm using like a knife for example, and it's just incredibly fast swinging, but you can like mix it up with the overhead and like a sweeping attack.
[59:40.84]Are they called chainswords in this universe?
[59:44.81]Yeah.
[59:46.89]There was one that they gave me in the tutorial and I was like, yeah, I need that.
[59:50.05]Alright, we're going to turn this off.
[59:51.03]Why was it doing?
[59:53.67]I don't know.
[59:53.95]It's to turn it off.
[59:56.17]I think it's over here.
[59:58.53]This is a heretical transmission.
[60:01.59]I hate that.
[60:03.27]Hold for signal.
[60:04.73]Uh-oh.
[60:05.29]Alright.
[60:05.89]Let's group up.
[60:09.35]On the way.
[60:10.19]Behind you.
[60:11.13]Oh, this is bad.
[60:11.77]Alright.
[60:12.97]That's it.
[60:14.11]Busting out the flamer.
[60:17.21]Busting a grenade here, lad.
[60:18.31]We got a weird guy over here.
[60:22.54]Weird guy.
[60:30.18]This thing is just screaming.
[60:33.90]You know what I'll tell you?
[60:35.20]Let me tell you about this game.
[60:36.19]There's a lot of activity going on.
[60:38.43]Like, this is very deep.
[60:39.71]A lot of activity.
[60:41.23]Stimulation.
[60:44.22]It's kind of... It's kind of sick.
[60:47.54]But you get into the swing of it.
[60:49.76]Like I... Last night, I was like really just... I hit like a weird flow state.
[60:55.99]Yeah.
[60:56.47]Where my mind left my body and I just like... 100%.
[60:59.93]I think that's my favorite part of this game.
[61:02.19]It's like once you hit that... Somebody just sniped me in the head.
[61:05.50]There's a sniper over there.
[61:08.32]So you can actually dodge their bullets because right before they fire, you hear a sound and there's like a flash from their scope.
[61:15.49]And then if you dodge left or right, you won't get hit.
[61:17.83]But it's difficult.
[61:24.03]Someone sounds like Roxo, the rock and roll clown.
[61:28.85]Yeah!
[61:30.96]Oh, what is it?
[61:32.16]I think that's my character.
[61:34.50]I picked a voice that was really like...
[61:37.05]Oh, it's you.
[61:37.65]Okay.
[61:37.80]Over here.
[61:39.48]Oh, alright.
[61:40.00]Let's get out of here.
[61:40.86]Wait, maybe it's not me.
[61:41.88]Is that not you?
[61:44.32]The Toxflamer.
[61:46.88]The customer is much crazier than my character.
[61:49.48]Never mind.
[61:50.20]Oh, the rock and roll clown.
[61:51.92]That is exactly what it sounds like.
[61:55.09]It might even be the same actor.
[61:58.30]That's right.
[61:59.12]We need to Google this.
[62:00.28]Do they have Google in this universe?
[62:01.74]I don't want to... I want to be... You gotta use a skull.
[62:03.95]It'll fly off.
[62:04.77]Come on!
[62:05.41]Come on, man!
[62:06.33]Come on, you're up there, man!
[62:07.71]Come on!
[62:08.05]Grab our hands!
[62:08.77]Come on!
[62:09.39]Wait, I forgot my keys!
[62:10.97]I'm playing, guys.
[62:12.41]Dang it!
[62:14.13]Oh my god, you're so big.
[62:21.58]My hand is really sweaty.
[62:25.80]Alright.
[62:26.83]Now you two unlock the store.
[62:28.87]So now we get some items.
[62:31.25]Yes, you can now purchase a weapon of choice.
[62:34.05]Perfect.
[62:37.57]This is a big decision.
[62:38.49]I got a Hellbore Lase Gun.
[62:48.54]$2,500.
[62:52.24]Game looks cool.
[62:52.94]Game is cool.
[62:54.26]Actually...
[62:56.56]actually very cool we got confirmation that it's not the voice of roxo oh okay oh I don't want to play this anymore what do I go for this flashlight
[63:13.17]We definitely need flashlights.
[63:15.16]We all gotta go buy flashlights.
[63:16.72]So, certain weapons have them.
[63:18.02]The lasgun, I think, is the main one.
[63:20.68]But there's also others that have it.
[63:22.32]So, where's the story?
[63:22.88]We unlock it right now?
[63:24.96]Alright, so, follow me.
[63:28.31]It's just to the right over here.
[63:30.25]I looked superimposed.
[63:31.33]Yeah, to the left.
[63:33.07]Sorry, not right.
[63:33.77]What am I talking about?
[63:34.63]God.
[63:44.00]requisition weapons and curios oh god my damn headset um I'll be watching you when you click the weapon look on at the three icons and you'll see the one all the way on the right will look like a flashlight oh this is my
[64:00.62]Again, I just want to say thanks again to Warhammer for sponsoring this stream.
[64:04.54]Game's really fun.
[64:05.96]That's obviously the first mission, but let's keep going.
[64:08.52]This is beta right now.
[64:09.72]You can pre-order it right now, the beta.
[64:12.52]Game launches on the 30th, but if you want access to the beta, you can pre-order it right now.
[64:18.36]Game is pretty sick.
[64:22.01]I look at myself in the mirror for two hours every day.
[64:24.55]Oh, wow.
[64:25.25]That's how I warm up.
[64:27.63]Or should I get the axe instead, Chet?
[64:30.97]I like your hair too.
[64:33.19]Thanks.
[64:33.79]Apparently I made a high Chachi.
[64:36.42]I gotta, where's the armor?
[64:38.30]Oh, this way over here.
[64:40.82]Oh, the revolver seems fun.
[64:49.13]You really do look like count a law.
[64:51.65]How much money do I have?
[64:52.21]That's so embarrassing.
[64:54.05]What's the difference between these knives and sword for wards acts for single target.
[65:00.90]I like your tattoo.
[65:01.62]What's it mean?
[65:03.06]Emperor.
[65:04.86]How could it not?
[65:05.90]Are these different rarities or something?
[65:08.00]Well, the numbers are... The eye level is like an important thing at this point.
[65:12.64]Yeah.
[65:12.74]What should I get?
[65:15.82]But you're basically going to level up every mission you do.
[65:18.55]And so you'll be able to get new stuff in the shop every time.
[65:22.17]What do I have?
[65:22.63]Yeah, what do I have right now?
[65:29.01]Alright, so damage is a little bit lower, but mobility is higher, range is higher, stopping power is higher, reload speed is lower.
[65:37.02]What about this one?
[65:38.40]Oh, okay.
[65:39.22]Tiny range, tons more damage, tons more reload.
[65:42.16]Okay, I don't know.
[65:44.00]Get the shovel.
[65:47.28]Oh, wow.
[65:48.04]I don't look like I'm wearing pajamas anymore.
[65:50.00]Did you get pants?
[65:52.54]My pants are still pajamas.
[65:53.66]Never mind.
[65:54.04]That's a lot of crowd control.
[65:55.28]What about a knight?
[65:58.16]I want the cleave damage.
[65:59.98]Whatever one has the most cleave damage is what I'm getting.
[66:03.79]Bring in the thunder hammer.
[66:05.33]But if you want, I would kind of recommend maybe a range weapon too, especially one with a flashlight.
[66:10.85]I don't think any of these have a flashlight.
[66:13.23]Do I have to buy it?
[66:13.87]I don't think Ogryn gets flashlights, unfortunately.
[66:16.25]They don't have a single flashlight option?
[66:20.03]Alright, I'm going with super cleave damage.
[66:22.86]I'm bringing a flashlight though, so we'll have some more.
[66:26.75]This one or this one?
[66:27.59]Criken, do I look cool walking slow like this?
[66:30.33]You look sick, my friend.
[66:32.92]Transaction complete.
[66:36.04]You can inspect it too.
[66:37.82]Are we doing the dark mission again right after this or are we doing something else?
[66:40.82]I'm down to do a dark mission.
[66:41.96]Let's do the dark mission, yeah?
[66:43.60]Okay.
[66:44.72]Let's do the one that power supply one.
[66:45.88]Although it's going to be really, I think, funny for your guys' first experience in all these levels to be with no lights on.
[66:52.15]Concluded.
[66:55.29]that on oh nice alright cool you have two options for dark missions yeah let's do let's do the power supply one is the one that they just um added right let's do that one yes but we it's a power supply it's the dark mission with two different main objectives so two different levels that oh dark mission on it so
[67:14.70]You can either do one where we're going after assassinating a target or we're trying to repair like a train.
[67:24.97]Assassinate.
[67:26.07]Let's do that one.
[67:27.21]And let's do it on normal.
[67:28.61]Let's turn it up a little.
[67:30.87]Difficulty two.
[67:31.55]Yeah, it'll be two difficulty.
[67:33.09]Yeah.
[67:34.23]Alright.
[67:34.67]Ready when you guys are.
[67:35.77]I'm ready.
[67:36.12]Do I have to ready up?
[67:39.10]Oh, I'm ready too.
[67:41.08]So if you, um, when you guys accept, just double check that you, you got the same, the weapons you want.
[67:47.41]Yeah.
[67:47.81]Open your inventory.
[67:48.51]Make sure it's in your inventory.
[67:50.95]Yeah.
[67:51.15]So I'm doing an axe and auto pistol.
[67:55.85]Um, I didn't have a beard for you before.
[67:58.68]Yeah, dude.
[67:59.12]Wait, did he?
[68:00.96]I should about it, yeah.
[68:02.56]It looks like your head's on upside down, kind of.
[68:05.43]I love your knife.
[68:08.71]Yeah, I know what you mean.
[68:09.65]It's one of those, like, illusion photos.
[68:12.91]Yeah.
[68:13.53]I bet if we flip that over, if we got some Photoshop specialist to somehow flip that.
[68:18.07]You always had a beard?
[68:18.89]What the hell is wrong with me?
[68:19.81]Specialist.
[68:20.45]Yeah, I've had the beard the whole time.
[68:21.63]You just got Mandela affected, I think.
[68:23.08]Yeah, I had like selective memory and removed his beard with Photoshop in my eyes.
[68:27.66]Ugh.
[68:31.26]Yeah, chat, my pistol has a flashlight.
[68:34.92]That's good.
[68:35.34]So at least one or two of us have light, right?
[68:38.48]Yeah, we'll be fine.
[68:39.43]Snot, do you have a flashlight?
[68:41.03]Oh, yeah.
[68:42.13]I spent all my money on a flashlight.
[68:44.23]I'm just swinging a knife in the dark, whatever.
[68:50.24]Oh, you guys look cool.
[68:52.10]You guys got different clothes, too.
[68:54.24]Yeah.
[68:54.72]Vinny's got a shirt and pajama pants.
[68:58.60]Basically wearing what I'm wearing.
[69:00.94]It's not even sick.
[69:04.41]Mouse 5?
[69:04.93]Yeah, it's like your secondary mouse button.
[69:07.27]Oh, no.
[69:08.13]Never mind.
[69:08.53]I don't have a light.
[69:09.99]Oh, no.
[69:10.47]It's not.
[69:12.25]You got one, though, right?
[69:13.15]Yeah, I've got one.
[69:14.63]Okay.
[69:15.94]We shall prove our faith this day.
[69:18.58]Can I electrify my hammer?
[69:20.22]Is this like a glow stick?
[69:21.52]I think I just got lost.
[69:22.34]No, I didn't.
[69:23.63]No, we're good.
[69:28.31]I can't light the way up for you guys because Jerm is so damn big.
[69:32.88]Yeah, I should be in the very back.
[69:34.84]I'll be in the back.
[69:41.63]I'll be in the back, charges in forward.
[69:44.97]Well, I realize I don't have any weapons that can shoot more than 10 feet in front of me.
[69:49.46]Oh God, it's so creepy when they activate, like when the flashlight goes over them.
[69:52.66]That's very cool.
[69:55.58]Oh my God!
[70:04.09]This is so much scarier without being able to see.
[70:06.77]Yeah.
[70:09.95]We can all take turns with my gun if we need.
[70:14.41]I keep forgetting that I'm one of the flashlight guys.
[70:16.67]It's like I switched to melee.
[70:18.74]I'm like, why'd it get dark?
[70:19.98]Oh, there's a person.
[70:26.10]Oops.
[70:27.22]They're so quiet too.
[70:31.94]What was that howl?
[70:34.44]Probably just a puppy.
[70:37.81]Oh, there he is dog.
[70:43.32]Alright, he's dead.
[70:45.22]Grenade.
[70:46.50]Ow.
[70:50.98]Watch out.
[70:52.38]Yo.
[70:54.58]Another dog.
[70:57.60]Oh, you just sniped his head off.
[70:59.62]We have to stay together because we have the regeneration, right?
[71:05.88]Yeah.
[71:07.00]It helps.
[71:07.28]Cohesion.
[71:08.94]Dude, this guy won't die.
[71:09.80]Oh, fuck.
[71:13.97]Oh my god!
[71:14.87]I'm dead!
[71:15.59]Oh shit!
[71:17.17]Oh my god, I'm down.
[71:20.55]That guy is hitting one hit kills.
[71:23.33]Wow.
[71:25.58]Ow.
[71:27.18]Alright, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[71:34.84]Yeah, guys, it's crazy.
[71:36.44]These guys are targeting me.
[71:38.73]They're all going for me.
[71:39.95]I mean, they probably read the lore, right?
[71:41.93]You're the main character.
[71:43.27]You guys doing good on ammo?
[71:46.47]Yeah, I'm okay.
[71:47.01]Uh-oh.
[71:48.33]We have slain the bomber.
[71:52.28]Did we slay the bomber or did the bomber explode on you?
[71:56.16]We got him from a distance, I think.
[71:57.54]Yeah, he's right here.
[72:00.70]This is a tiny skull.
[72:01.74]Is this a child's skull?
[72:03.34]What do you think?
[72:05.92]You know what?
[72:06.33]That checks out for the Warhammer universe.
[72:08.11]Yeah.
[72:10.61]It's so dark.
[72:12.33]Look at how dark it is.
[72:15.45]No.
[72:15.73]No.
[72:16.31]I just immediately don't even accept that that's a possibility.
[72:19.39]No.
[72:19.55]I'm sorry, Sniper.
[72:20.93]How did you get up here?
[72:31.41]You know, honestly, these are voice lines you say in the mirror for fun.
[72:37.50]We should get some voice lines.
[72:39.26]I want to practice my own voice lines.
[72:41.82]Big guy.
[72:42.18]I'm going to stop communicating like the people.
[72:45.02]Good afternoon, good evening, and good night.
[72:48.19]Weird guy over here.
[72:49.63]Yeah, big guy.
[72:53.35]I definitely need something like, oh, I'm down.
[72:57.47]That's going to be using a lot.
[73:00.80]in your everyday life.
[73:02.66]Yeah, that's got some... Oh my god, sniper.
[73:07.40]Yeah, I can't snipe them anymore.
[73:09.48]How many of you guys walked around saying Thanos lines from Infinity War?
[73:14.30]After Infinity War came out?
[73:16.46]Come on, be truthful.
[73:18.73]A little bit.
[73:19.17]Not as much as the Joker when Dark Knight came out, Jerma.
[73:22.59]That and Borat were just like... Between me and my friends, we were the annoying guys.
[73:29.82]Oh, no.
[73:31.32]But I did reduce to atoms.
[73:33.00]It was a bit of a favorite of mine.
[73:35.26]This is kind of scary.
[73:39.36]What is this sound?
[73:40.48]This is the tox burst.
[73:41.50]It's the one that explodes when it gets too close.
[73:44.90]Keep an eye out.
[73:46.54]It's getting louder.
[73:47.43]I don't know where he is.
[73:49.09]I don't see him.
[73:51.09]Quieter.
[73:52.65]Oh, my God.
[73:53.09]I see the health station, guys.
[73:54.27]I'm going to make a run for it.
[73:57.04]Careful.
[73:57.48]Take it easy.
[73:58.56]Right over here.
[73:59.52]There he is.
[74:00.78]There he is.
[74:05.70]Watch out.
[74:06.68]Explosive barrel.
[74:07.30]I don't care if anyone needs it.
[74:08.74]There's a little bit of ammo.
[74:11.66]I'm just clunking him in the head.
[74:26.60]I think the melee is better for the armored guys, no?
[74:29.72]I'm trying to hit him directly in the face.
[74:31.04]Do you have like an axe that's armor piercing?
[74:33.12]Yeah, my axe is probably pretty good for that.
[74:37.06]So this healing station, should I take this?
[74:39.99]Yeah.
[74:40.55]Yeah, for sure.
[74:41.29]Because you'll recover that.
[74:42.71]Oh my god, it's him again.
[74:43.61]It's him again.
[74:44.73]Oh god.
[74:45.13]Alright, we got to fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.
[74:48.19]I'm taking up my cube.
[74:49.29]It's going for me, going for me, going for me.
[74:51.26]I missed.
[74:51.58]Did you throw a box of grenades?
[74:57.08]Oh my god, what's he doing to you?
[74:57.86]He's sucking you.
[74:58.60]He's sucking out your soul.
[74:59.48]Oh my god.
[75:00.30]Stop it.
[75:01.58]Leave him alone.
[75:03.20]Put him down.
[75:04.56]Oh, is he dead?
[75:06.36]I'm actually dead.
[75:07.80]Oh my goodness.
[75:08.37]I can't believe I'm dead.
[75:09.63]I can't believe you.
[75:12.65]He's almost dead.
[75:13.17]Oh, what happened?
[75:14.35]This guy's cracked.
[75:18.39]Oh god, and you got an ogre.
[75:19.65]Ow.
[75:20.71]Ow.
[75:21.76]Ow.
[75:22.54]Ow.
[75:23.56]You're doing great, Smush.
[75:25.97]There's a chat member that said that this thing is like the witch from Left 4 Dead and you should avoid.
[75:31.00]I got it.
[75:33.66]I'm coming, snot.
[75:34.72]What happened, snot?
[75:37.08]Nothing's over here.
[75:38.78]The honest truth, I think that was unrelated to the enemies.
[75:42.63]I think I just got tired.
[75:44.01]That was actually a great voice line.
[75:48.06]If I die here, I'll haunt you forever.
[75:50.64]Anyone that went down should heal up.
[75:54.42]What is that guy doing?
[75:56.67]I'm totally eliminated, but you guys will find me at some point.
[75:59.65]We'll find you soon.
[76:00.57]Should I do this?
[76:02.03]If he downs someone, he just literally sucks the life out of them.
[76:05.35]That's insane.
[76:06.13]Alright.
[76:07.53]I can't see.
[76:09.57]What did you say?
[76:10.85]That's twagic.
[76:12.57]There he is.
[76:17.61]Heal?
[76:18.09]I couldn't.
[76:20.95]Could I have healed right there?
[76:22.70]I didn't have an indicator.
[76:25.90]The medical station.
[76:27.02]Yeah.
[76:27.60]You did it.
[76:28.08]You saved me.
[76:28.76]Thank you.
[76:29.58]Oh, guys, look at all this crap.
[76:30.77]Look at all this crap.
[76:33.88]That's good crap.
[76:34.46]Oh, there's lights that turn on.
[76:36.56]Oh, I got it.
[76:37.48]I like this place.
[76:39.72]It's got lights.
[76:40.44]I'll take them grenades.
[76:42.38]I could definitely use some health.
[76:45.30]Oh, there's a health kit thing.
[76:46.36]Somebody picked one up.
[76:48.18]Oh.
[76:49.16]Well, you know what?
[76:49.62]We can... Does it recover?
[76:51.12]Hey, Criken, do health kits recover purple health?
[76:54.38]No, they recover non-purple health.
[76:56.62]Oh, I feel so much safer around everybody.
[77:00.93]Ouch.
[77:07.75]Did we start the thing I think it's going in by accident We're good.
[77:15.10]Well, I say by accident, but I didn't know what it did.
[77:19.44]Oh my god, that hurts Alright, I might have to use cover here because there's a lot of range.
[77:25.46]Yeah, there's a lot shot at unless you're smush then you're I'm gonna try to wrap around
[77:39.43]Let me turn the music down.
[77:48.32]Fuck it.
[77:48.62]Alright.
[77:49.86]I got the ones that were over here.
[77:51.34]Oh.
[77:57.21]Oh, my God.
[77:57.97]Holy smokes.
[78:03.39]Toxflamer.
[78:04.77]Somewhere.
[78:05.13]Oh, boy.
[78:06.65]I found him.
[78:07.29]I think I found him.
[78:08.39]Did you get him?
[78:09.99]No, he got me a little.
[78:11.09]Oh, he's right here behind us.
[78:12.85]So Trevor, your class has like a head-popping ability.
[78:18.33]Have you used that yet?
[78:19.47]Yeah, I have.
[78:20.48]But the thing about it is I think that's how I died once.
[78:22.74]I think I just charged too much and then blew myself up.
[78:26.08]Yeah, so if it reaches like 100, then you blow up.
[78:28.58]But if you use your ultimate, then it vents it.
[78:30.84]And also there's like a vent ability you can do.
[78:33.77]That's just not...
[78:35.31]Thanks, guys.
[78:36.43]This is like an escort mission.
[78:37.59]Yeah, I keep forgetting to use my ability.
[78:41.25]I'll try to remember, chat.
[78:42.43]I just... F, right?
[78:44.47]Uh, yeah.
[78:46.09]Yeah, yeah.
[78:47.87]This is, dude.
[78:48.53]You guys just escorted me.
[78:49.45]I'm just going to slow walk.
[78:50.53]I'm going to go slower than you guys can walk at normal speeds.
[78:53.20]Snot and me, I think.
[78:54.54]Yeah.
[78:54.74]Go, Snot.
[78:55.82]Alright, Snot.
[78:56.36]That's you.
[78:58.66]This hadron voice... This voice sounds like Beepo from Mario and Rabbids chat.
[79:05.85]Are those games fun?
[79:07.73]I love Mario and Rabbids.
[79:08.89]It's just, you know, it's like XCOM Lite, but real time.
[79:12.07]Wait, really?
[79:12.59]Yeah.
[79:13.95]I had literally no idea what the gameplay was like for that game.
[79:15.99]Especially the new one.
[79:18.23]It's dope.
[79:19.33]I don't know why I'm saying sick and dope so much.
[79:21.22]I feel like it's the 90s part two for me lately.
[79:24.68]But really, no, it's awesome.
[79:26.10]I really enjoy the Mario Rabbids games.
[79:29.18]Oh, boy.
[79:29.64]I went down.
[79:37.71]Alright, watch that.
[79:38.49]Watch that fire.
[79:41.78]I'm getting into this.
[79:43.38]Hell yeah.
[79:46.54]Criken, that does sound exactly like you when you do that.
[79:49.70]That's actually unbelievable.
[79:52.77]The voice.
[79:53.11]Like...
[79:56.59]Sometimes I actually think it's you doing it.
[79:58.41]Doesn't matter if I can't see.
[80:16.76]Yeah, I'm out of ammo, guys.
[80:17.66]The flashlight's gotta go away for now.
[80:20.06]Doesn't matter.
[80:21.82]I should've let Snot get that ammo.
[80:25.22]We gotta find some ammo for Snot for flashlight purposes.
[80:28.63]I think I found something.
[80:30.29]This looks promising over here.
[80:31.35]We don't want to see this.
[80:32.63]Guys, it's ammo.
[80:33.73]Good news.
[80:34.17]Get it.
[80:34.57]Hell yeah.
[80:38.27]Oh my god.
[80:39.35]That was the scariest shit.
[80:40.71]Especially when it's this dark.
[80:42.32]Another one.
[80:50.37]Oh god, help.
[80:51.33]Oh, he threw me into the fire.
[80:57.09]What?
[80:57.71]Trying to do big slashes.
[81:08.70]Oh my god, you just feel it bowling.
[81:12.77]I love that move.
[81:19.96]You wanna go?
[81:25.74]Spinning my heels!
[81:28.30]I love that.
[81:30.82]Parking lot, press 3 to deploy ammo.
[81:33.56]Oh fuck, I have ammo this whole time!
[81:37.60]Snot could've used that.
[81:40.94]It's not my fault!
[81:42.76]Right here, Snot.
[81:46.06]Snot, right here, right here.
[81:50.32]Oh my god, it's the thing again!
[81:53.26]What a call out.
[81:54.20]What thing?
[81:54.94]Where?
[81:55.46]What was that Scooby Doo reaction?
[81:58.38]I don't know where we're supposed to be looking.
[82:01.39]What?
[82:01.97]It's over in that direction.
[82:02.83]I think it's the demonic host corruption witch thing.
[82:06.31]Oh shit.
[82:08.09]Don't go in there, man.
[82:09.17]We can avoid it.
[82:09.93]We can avoid it.
[82:10.55]I'm telling you, don't go in there, man.
[82:12.64]Oh, fuck.
[82:13.10]We can't avoid it.
[82:13.72]Alright.
[82:14.34]I'm going to try to get a peek at it.
[82:16.54]I'm going to go this way.
[82:17.86]I'm going to go this way.
[82:18.96]And I'm not going to.
[82:20.48]I'm just going to.
[82:21.48]Okay.
[82:22.24]Follow me, everybody.
[82:23.40]Eye contact.
[82:24.60]How does it work?
[82:25.06]I'm going to throw a grenade.
[82:25.86]No, I'm just kidding.
[82:28.34]Guys, I bit my tongue.
[82:29.44]Damn it.
[82:29.74]Grenade!
[82:31.00]No.
[82:31.84]You didn't even land it.
[82:33.44]You missed.
[82:33.92]No, they threw a grenade at me.
[82:36.02]Oh, I thought you were screaming you threw the grenade.
[82:38.57]Oh, no.
[82:43.83]Ooh, creepy.
[82:46.33]Grenades here if anyone needs extra.
[82:47.83]Actually, I do.
[82:49.87]Just don't know where I am.
[82:55.49]Anyone need grenades?
[82:56.69]Yeah, I'll take them.
[82:59.41]My box of grenades.
[83:00.47]Alright.
[83:07.90]Where the hell are we?
[83:09.00]Wait, we went back.
[83:10.12]This is backwards.
[83:10.92]This is backwards?
[83:11.52]Wait, is it?
[83:11.90]I was wondering why it was so peaceful.
[83:13.40]Yeah, there's no way this is forwards.
[83:15.20]Oh, no.
[83:15.96]I do.
[83:16.46]You know what?
[83:17.24]Is the heart inside of the outline based on how... Is the heart... Is the heart based on your health?
[83:28.16]The outline?
[83:32.30]I guess so.
[83:33.00]Maybe you can start seeing their little skeletons whenever they're hurt.
[83:35.93]Oh, yeah.
[83:36.45]Like the thing through the walls.
[83:38.47]Yeah, I see your skeleton right now, Criken.
[83:40.62]Yeah, I think the color of your heart is how much health you've got.
[83:44.28]That's actually pretty cool.
[83:47.23]Alright, we have to go back in the room with the weird guy.
[83:49.41]I think so.
[83:50.25]We snuck the wrong direction.
[83:52.31]Yeah, we got to go this way.
[83:53.35]Here, come this way.
[83:54.43]Follow me.
[83:54.93]Just don't look.
[83:56.21]Just don't look.
[83:57.05]It can't see you.
[83:57.69]It's OK.
[83:58.47]It's OK.
[83:59.13]Alright, we're good.
[84:00.07]Copernicus, you're probably going to want this.
[84:02.53]OK.
[84:02.63]What's up there?
[84:15.29]Probably use one more use of it.
[84:17.19]Some good stuff.
[84:18.09]Smush.
[84:18.73]Ow!
[84:19.15]Why don't you take that?
[84:20.95]Ow, ow, ow, ow.
[84:22.19]I'll take it.
[84:26.81]You know what I want?
[84:27.44]I want a big shield.
[84:29.10]I wonder if they have it in this game.
[84:30.10]You're gonna get one, yeah.
[84:31.32]Thank goodness.
[84:31.90]The Ogryn's the only ones that get it.
[84:33.30]Oh yeah, I want it bad.
[84:35.22]Wait, you can just be like a wall?
[84:36.98]Yeah, you can like, right here, you can just put the shield down and no one will be able to get past us.
[84:40.69]Cool.
[84:41.13]We just fire past them.
[84:45.30]Are they dead?
[84:49.18]No.
[84:49.46]Yes.
[84:49.80]This is a scary room.
[84:55.71]Oh, someone in Dave's game.
[84:56.81]Oh, okay.
[85:00.33]I like that it's not just all the lights are off.
[85:02.59]Like the ones in the level, like the torches and stuff are still on.
[85:05.71]So this is cool.
[85:06.89]Yeah.
[85:07.83]It's cool again.
[85:08.35]Mood lighting.
[85:15.12]I love that.
[85:15.70]Dead voice.
[85:16.92]Okay.
[85:21.06]So wait.
[85:22.46]Find Magistrati.
[85:23.80]Oh, okay.
[85:26.69]I thought now was the time we were going to assassinate that dude.
[85:28.99]Oh wait, is it a boss?
[85:30.73]No one needs ammo, right?
[85:31.85]Oh, there's another fucking witch thing.
[85:34.13]There's three of them in this level.
[85:38.80]Wait, where is this one?
[85:39.78]Oh, it's right.
[85:40.62]Are we activated?
[85:41.25]Oh, yikes.
[85:42.33]It's activated.
[85:43.23]It's activated.
[85:43.67]It's activated.
[85:44.61]Are you sure?
[85:45.15]Wait, no.
[85:45.47]What's that stuff coming out?
[85:47.05]It's lasers that the enemies are shooting.
[85:49.31]Oh.
[85:49.67]As long as we don't shoot it.
[85:55.98]God.
[85:58.10]I don't want to miss and hit him.
[86:00.90]I'd be so embarrassed.
[86:01.94]Oh, there's a med kit over here.
[86:03.28]I'm going to grab it.
[86:06.58]Ow.
[86:07.00]There's somebody sniping.
[86:08.66]Ow.
[86:10.99]Ah, Jesus.
[86:13.25]I think we have to just rush in there.
[86:16.27]I'm going around it.
[86:18.43]I wonder what the aggro range is on it.
[86:21.45]By the way, it sucks.
[86:24.09]Like, you get hit.
[86:26.97]Oh, on that.
[86:27.89]Oh, I don't know.
[86:31.41]Yeah, I was getting hit while crouched behind cover.
[86:35.51]Alright, I think we're alright.
[86:36.45]Just keep an eye on it.
[86:37.19]I think we're okay.
[86:39.63]It might just be the icy ground that activates it when you stand on top of it.
[86:44.65]That's true, or attacking it.
[86:46.45]Yeah.
[86:48.16]That doesn't sound good.
[86:49.94]Yeah, either there's something going on down there.
[86:52.20]Behind us.
[86:52.72]Oh, that's scary.
[86:55.86]Watch this way.
[86:56.24]Oh, my goodness.
[87:04.14]Oh my god.
[87:05.80]Alright, it's time to use the axe.
[87:09.00]There are too many people down here, dude.
[87:10.96]There are.
[87:11.45]This is a fire hazard.
[87:19.89]And my axe.
[87:22.23]And my bomb.
[87:23.27]And my bomb.
[87:26.80]I'm on solo.
[87:27.86]Oh wait, wrong.
[87:28.52]Wrong song.
[87:30.58]Is that... is that... Zombie?
[87:36.94]I don't know where I'm going.
[87:38.62]There's a healing thing here if anyone needs it.
[87:41.34]Oh, between you and... it's not invading.
[87:43.14]Ooh, creepy church.
[87:45.08]No!
[87:58.42]I feel like this game is just metal and creepy churches.
[88:00.88]Help, pull me up.
[88:02.12]Oh no, what do you mean pull me up?
[88:05.34]I keep trying to jump on top of stuff and it vaults me over it.
[88:07.86]Somebody keeps throwing grenades at us.
[88:13.52]This place is giving me real creepy vibes, everyone.
[88:18.89]I love how you said the barrel explodes and not even a second later it exploded.
[88:21.83]I hear somebody.
[88:22.89]Big, weird guy.
[88:24.23]Weird guy.
[88:24.69]We got a weird guy over here.
[88:25.85]We got a weird guy.
[88:27.73]I said, just watch them do that.
[88:31.59]There's an eye on his arm.
[88:34.25]Is that an eyeball?
[88:35.11]Oh, no.
[88:35.99]Oh, yeah.
[88:36.61]That's some chaos corruption.
[88:39.45]Vinny, you just described all of Warhammer 40k.
[88:41.81]What?
[88:42.21]Metal and religion?
[88:43.79]Yes.
[88:44.29]Pretty much, yes.
[88:47.12]And dirt.
[88:47.60]A little dirt.
[88:48.50]It's cool, though.
[88:50.71]I really hope they're going to add a tech priest later.
[88:52.66]The ones that literally just pray to the machine spirit and they're like, my gun works because of my prayers.
[88:59.68]I'm getting zapped by this thing.
[89:01.82]Help.
[89:04.20]Now, are there any giant sand worms in the dune?
[89:07.38]Sorry, the worm.
[89:09.12]What are you applying here, man?
[89:10.70]It's the wrong universe.
[89:12.62]Sorry about that.
[89:14.00]Probably.
[89:14.54]Wrong universe.
[89:17.97]Group up.
[89:18.47]Ammo here.
[89:21.71]I'm going to get one.
[89:26.79]I'm going to stick with the knife.
[89:29.52]What is this?
[89:30.88]That's for crafting later on.
[89:32.28]Crafting?
[89:32.84]Yeah, then you get to craft weapons and stuff.
[89:39.57]I think, Criken, is that correct?
[89:41.96]You craft weapons or you re-craft them or something?
[89:44.94]Yeah, you can do both.
[89:46.84]If you think of every weapon you get as a template, you can then create your own and reroll to get specific modifiers for it.
[89:56.30]My knife has like bleed on hit and so my build is like if I hit a bleeding enemy I get higher crit chance.
[90:03.91]And so a bunch of stuff happens when I crit.
[90:05.57]So then I just have like a crit bleed build.
[90:08.23]Well, what's that?
[90:09.15]Oh, dude.
[90:14.48]It's similar to Vermintide.
[90:15.78]Bunch of lads over here.
[90:18.24]Is Vermintide about lads?
[90:20.05]Yep.
[90:20.43]Yeah.
[90:21.05]I thought it was a rat extermination game.
[90:22.83]I didn't know it was Warhammer related for like a while.
[90:25.03]Because everyone was like, Vinny, you need to play Vermintide.
[90:29.01]No thanks.
[90:29.74]Gross.
[90:34.36]Oh.
[90:37.08]I hope I'm... Alright, big guy.
[90:39.34]Tyranids have giant sandworms.
[90:44.48]I said... Oh, sorry.
[90:47.12]Guys, he's dead over here.
[90:48.11]We gotta help him.
[90:48.93]Oh, oh.
[90:50.54]Stop goofing around.
[90:51.90]What happened?
[90:52.58]I got Smush.
[90:53.52]The cleave on this is actually huge.
[90:56.52]It's funny.
[90:56.92]I'll tank.
[90:57.80]I'll tank.
[90:58.18]I'll tank.
[91:18.22]taunting taunting taunting I think I think he picks one person and goes down here quick help him one of us is definitely gonna be holy yeah I'm I'm out I'm dead I missed I'm about to go down too
[91:41.14]No!
[91:42.02]It would be so cool if I cost us the mission.
[91:44.10]I can't figure out how to get back up there.
[91:45.38]It's gonna be okay.
[91:45.84]It's gonna be okay.
[91:46.32]Smush Scott this.
[91:47.76]I'm gonna smush this guy.
[91:48.58]Where's Scott, man?
[91:50.06]He pushed me down here on this ledge.
[91:51.58]I'm trapped.
[91:52.08]Stop doing that!
[91:53.12]Leave him alone!
[91:53.84]Hurry!
[91:55.04]Hurry!
[91:55.86]Did I get him?
[91:56.45]Just in time.
[91:57.15]Yeah.
[92:00.51]Oh, it's too dark.
[92:03.47]Oh, Vinny.
[92:03.85]I'm sorry.
[92:04.29]It's alright.
[92:05.91]It's my fault.
[92:06.81]I didn't know that's what I was shooting.
[92:09.03]I thought I was shooting some regular dude in the distance.
[92:11.98]Ooh, a med crate.
[92:13.32]I got a med crate.
[92:15.08]Should we use it right now?
[92:16.98]I'm kind of hurting.
[92:17.58]Did it work?
[92:19.42]Yeah, sure.
[92:19.90]Yeah, you just got to stand in the smelly air.
[92:23.14]I bet this would feel so excellent.
[92:25.87]Can you imagine having tonsillitis and then throwing one of these down?
[92:29.41]It's like a future Vicks vapor rub.
[92:32.31]I've had enough of these people here.
[92:37.83]I'm out of ammo.
[92:39.05]Guys, we're going dark.
[92:39.87]Alright.
[92:42.01]Well, there's Vinny.
[92:44.08]Oh, yeah.
[92:45.28]Yeah, I'm in there somewhere.
[92:49.64]Somebody said, you're button mashing.
[92:54.02]Yeah, I am.

[93:30.45]I want to switch to melee more, but then everything gets dark.
[93:33.37]I need to be the team light.
[93:35.75]It's very, very helpful.
[93:37.59]I was about to say, I don't know how much it's helping.
[93:41.23]It's helping?
[93:41.77]Is it pretty visible?
[93:43.05]Oh, yeah.
[93:43.41]No, it's great.
[93:44.67]When I turn my light off and I just look around at yours, it's tremendously helpful.
[93:49.92]Alright.
[93:50.30]Here's the way out and also a medical station and ammunition.
[93:53.56]I don't know why I said it like that.
[93:55.60]Ammunition.
[93:57.36]Ammunition.
[93:58.81]Alright, I'll take me some of their medical.
[94:01.27]Hey guys, medical crate over here.
[94:04.53]Oh, that's good to have.
[94:05.33]I did that for you guys, not for you guys in the call.

[94:17.48]Oh yeah, I'm sorry.
[94:19.98]Chat, I have to apologize to my chat too.
[94:22.02]I forgot about them for a bit.
[94:24.15]It's very easy to just get like tunnel vision in this game.
[94:27.03]When we were playing Among Us VR,
[94:29.85]like you're a you're in VR b you're being terrorized by charborg right like so much going on it was hard to imagine chat was even there yeah if there's too much going on I just my brain shuts down and I can't this is just ignore chat night unfortunate yeah chat is the the uh the odd man out so to speak it's alright chat

[95:03.90]Captain America.
[95:04.87]Captain Ander... Anderson?
[95:08.01]Yeah, I see an Andor.
[95:09.99]He's got a shield.
[95:11.95]Ow!

[95:16.67]Yeah, pop the bubble and then we do damage.
[95:19.61]That's which one's him?
[95:20.43]I light it up.
[95:21.09]I know his brain.
[95:22.58]Nobody can see.
[95:23.50]He looks like... Just stab him.
[95:25.58]Joe.
[95:28.18]Oh shit, watch out, back it up, back it up.
[95:32.47]Break that bubble.
[95:35.29]Hey, um.

[95:38.47]Oh, okay, I was gonna say the heels would be awesome, yeah.
[95:43.85]Oh, this is the music.
[95:45.15]Yeah, this music is also awesome.
[95:47.43]This is the one that does the thing Jerome was doing where he was like.
[95:53.82]Sounds like they're saying this is Halloween.
[95:56.48]This is Halloween.
[95:57.10]This is Halloween.
[95:59.00]Halloween.
[96:02.04]Oh, I got ammo here.
[96:04.44]Reload the gun.
[96:06.34]Reload the gun.
[96:07.00]I'm going to put healing down on the boss.
[96:11.02]I had a version of that Halloween song for Staten Island.
[96:13.61]It went like this.
[96:15.11]This is Parkaset.
[96:16.27]This is Parkaset.
[96:17.43]Parkaset.
[96:17.99]Parkaset.
[96:19.05]There was a bit of a Parkaset problem here like 10 years ago, so.
[96:22.14]Shields down.
[96:22.56]I thought it was being funny.
[96:24.22]It was mean.
[96:28.14]Oh, fuck.
[96:39.51]Everyone make a scream.
[96:42.81]Make a scream?
[96:45.07]That's what my chat member said.
[96:46.64]I don't know what that means.
[96:50.54]Keep killing them.
[96:51.20]Let everybody do a voice line from your character.
[96:55.54]The boss is dead.
[96:59.24]Good.
[97:00.10]We did it.
[97:00.72]Good job, everyone.
[97:04.28]Was that good enough?
[97:05.70]That was good.
[97:07.04]Alright.
[97:07.36]Good.
[97:07.60]Let's wrap up.
[97:10.98]Oh my god, that guy turns into just gibs.
[97:16.02]Grubhub a salami.
[97:17.71]On me.
[97:17.99]That was cool.
[97:21.43]That was fun.
[97:25.14]You just got possessed.
[97:29.45]That looks so good.
[97:30.67]Do higher difficulty?
[97:32.31]Well, we need to get our levels up a little and unlock a few weapons.
[97:36.57]I wouldn't try the next difficulty until at least level five.
[97:40.47]Yeah.
[97:42.79]At level five, you unlock skills and stuff.
[97:46.01]Alright.
[97:46.35]That thing looks pretty amazing.
[97:51.22]The comm chatter doesn't meet E3 quality standards.
[97:55.54]We can do an E3 freaking comm chatter.
[97:57.98]We could easily.
[97:58.92]No, we absolutely could for sure.
[98:00.29]We're all very, very familiar.
[98:06.03]Copernicus, I've got a Tango on my six.
[98:08.17]I'm going to go look at this new weapon.
[98:11.15]And I'm also going to make sure to tell you guys that, again, Warhammer is sponsored this stream.
[98:16.83]Game's actually really goddamn fun.
[98:20.75]It's available if you pre-order it.
[98:22.28]This is the beta.
[98:23.78]The game comes out on the 30th.
[98:26.76]Four-player co-op.
[98:29.06]Played Vermintide.
[98:29.84]It's kind of in that same world.
[98:32.14]Also Warhammer.
[98:36.34]And let's keep going.
[98:38.58]It's been pretty fun so far.
[98:41.16]Pants are like the gold standard of like this game's economy.
[98:46.28]I want to see that gun.
[98:50.20]Oh my God, you're right.
[98:51.42]They're so expensive.
[98:52.32]I want to look at that thing.
[98:58.48]Yeah, 15,000.
[99:00.14]I'm going to look like a dweeb forever.
[99:02.75]Yeah, 20,000.
[99:05.17]Wait, where did you buy your shirt from?
[99:07.63]It was just in the character creator.
[99:11.05]Wait, you can change your shirt in the character creator?
[99:13.66]Yeah, also the character creator has a bunch of personality questions that I was not prepared for.
[99:18.08]I can't, I don't even, does that matter?
[99:21.54]Does that add anything to your character?
[99:23.30]It's your voice lines.
[99:26.25]Really?
[99:26.57]Mm-hmm.
[99:29.37]That that's actually pretty cool.
[99:32.05]Because honestly, it's like a 10 question survey that you take when you make your character.
[99:42.73]I definitely needed a gun.
[99:44.55]How often should you buy better guns and all that?
[99:50.62]Um,
[99:52.80]I'd say like every other level at this point is probably good.
[99:56.56]Or if you literally just want to try a new type of weapon, I'd say like just buy it.
[100:00.59]It's never a bad idea.
[100:02.83]Yeah, I have a nice variety now.
[100:04.29]I'm pretty happy with that.
[100:07.85]Because eventually you're going to start buying them to craft them into better gear.
[100:12.07]Wait, you break them down?
[100:13.63]Yeah, so you can break them down to get money, or you can use them as raw materials to craft a better version of whatever that weapon is.
[100:22.56]Ooh.
[100:23.02]So I have, like, three different knives, because knives are my favorite.
[100:25.58]So I was like, I'll buy a bunch so that I have options when I'm upgrading them.
[100:30.42]How do you break the old one down?
[100:33.17]If you go into your inventory and then click on it and then hold X, it'll discard.
[100:40.82]Yeah, this is the slowest reload ever.
[100:44.18]But the gun actually shoots through.
[100:46.24]Look at that.
[100:46.64]It actually hits more than one target.
[100:49.76]Cool.
[100:52.43]Go to the training area?
[100:53.51]Oh, that's where you guys are, right?
[100:55.01]Yeah, I'm in the training area.
[101:01.23]Where's that at compared to the Walt Disneyland place?
[101:07.80]Oh, God.
[101:08.36]I don't even know how to explain it.
[101:11.10]I've got a good imagination.
[101:12.14]I'll probably just imagine how my gun would shoot.
[101:14.40]Shrine of the Omnissiah?
[101:16.88]What is this?
[101:18.88]Maybe level 4?
[101:20.70]This dude's name is HowDoIPlayThisGame.
[101:24.89]He's level 10.
[101:25.57]He seems to have a pretty good grasp.
[101:26.79]Trust him.
[101:27.47]Yes, trust that chat member.
[101:29.19]That viewer.
[101:29.83]That player.
[101:30.71]Oh my god.
[101:31.23]I'm fine.
[101:34.41]Just a mini stroke.
[101:37.05]It's an upgrade station?
[101:38.14]Oh, that's when you get to do that.
[101:39.16]Alright.
[101:40.18]What's over here?
[101:44.92]Yeah, this revolver is fucking awesome.
[101:46.62]R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.
[101:55.35]I can do like one more.
[101:57.45]If you guys are okay with one more.
[101:59.24]Oh yeah, I'm going to play this for at least the next hour.
[102:01.28]Yeah, OK, because I have a I have an engagement.
[102:05.48]I must go to congratulations.
[102:08.52]No, no, it's just.
[102:11.01]It's a friends giving.
[102:13.47]Also, there's my other friends are doing a charity stream today, so I'm going to be throwing them the host after this.
[102:19.59]But yeah, very cool.
[102:21.37]Oh yeah.
[102:25.25]Only an hour.
[102:25.97]No, I'm down to play.
[102:29.54]um you guys okay finding a replacement after I leave we can also just maybe do randoms it doesn't really matter right no probably not yeah I got some people that are down to play I think yeah everyone just come on in that's easy alright should I get what's uh what's a mission that we should do
[102:54.28]Do you want to keep doing dark ones or do you want to do one that... Let's do a normal one.
[102:59.77]Yeah, I want to see for a little bit.
[103:02.11]Yeah, chat member, I meant raid.
[103:04.25]I forgot the... I say host still because I've been saying it for like years.
[103:09.15]But yeah, they got rid of that feature.
[103:10.86]So I'll raid.
[103:12.60]Is there another one with a boss?
[103:13.48]The bosses are fun.
[103:17.35]There's one.
[103:18.57]What's that weird slug thing, Kryken?
[103:20.98]You know that slug boss?
[103:22.92]Beast of Miracle.
[103:24.32]Yeah, I love that thing.
[103:26.10]So the lore of that thing is he just wants to hug.
[103:29.50]He's just friendly and wants to, like a golden retriever.
[103:33.77]He just wants to hug you.
[103:34.61]I don't give him a hug.
[103:36.27]But he's incredibly poisonous and also eats you by accident.
[103:40.38]Something else that I'm realizing right now, too, which is interesting.
[103:43.88]So these missions up here, they reset or refresh every 10 to 15 minutes or something.
[103:49.66]Yeah.
[103:50.50]Interesting.
[103:51.94]So you'll always have new things.
[103:56.33]Oh.
[103:56.61]Oh, it literally just happened.
[103:58.01]I saw that.
[103:58.45]Yeah, yeah, it just happened.
[103:59.99]What?
[104:02.49]So we could do... I don't think we've done this mission yet.
[104:07.21]What's a raid?
[104:10.25]That's a difficulty one, but that one's a fun level.
[104:14.01]So unfortunately, I don't have it on two right now, but okay This place in like a pleasant location One takes place in a Chuck E. Cheese ball pit This is a huge ball pits the whole level which is to say that it's a pit of disease which is what this game is about I was about to say make sure you equip your weapons
[104:38.19]Thanks.
[104:38.69]Yeah, I got my revolver.
[104:45.01]Somebody said, why am I playing as the Amish Hulk?
[104:52.28]I love every weapon I've seen you have.
[104:53.88]I love it.
[104:54.34]Look at this big, giant knife.
[104:59.94]Yeah, it's like the Hulk's brother, right?
[105:01.89]They went separate ways in life.
[105:04.33]Yeah, the Herc.
[105:05.51]The Herc.
[105:10.40]And they have to go convince the Amish Hulk to, like, come on, man, we need you.
[105:15.87]And he's, like, putting a wheelbarrow with butter in it.
[105:18.97]He doesn't want anything to do with it.
[105:20.85]He refuses to ride the train to get to the mission.
[105:24.85]He walks there.
[105:27.53]We need you, Amish Hulk.
[105:30.70]The Credible Hulk.
[105:34.34]The Credible Hulk.
[105:36.23]I just borrowed that from a chat member.
[105:38.55]Apparently, the Hurk are a real thing in 40k, so I accidentally... Chat, when you have lore the size of 45 bibles, there's going to be something.
[105:49.89]Dude, what is this?
[105:51.43]It's probably true.
[105:53.11]Everything's make-believe words, guys.
[105:54.91]Oh, I can stab.
[105:56.17]The Blimpticus are real.
[106:06.89]I'm so glad I can see.
[106:08.73]Oh my god, this environment.
[106:13.18]Are those people?
[106:14.18]Those are on our side.
[106:16.36]They're like the ones sending us in.
[106:17.64]They're basically the suicide squad, right?
[106:19.46]Oh, okay.
[106:22.58]That's right.
[106:23.48]Yeah, I know.
[106:24.58]The prologue, right?
[106:30.25]Now you can appreciate the level with all the lights in it.
[106:34.67]I guess I can hit fire.
[106:35.41]I don't have to destabilize it.
[106:37.49]It's nice that I can like switch to a weapon that doesn't have a flashlight now.
[106:41.97]This thing is so much better than the thing I just was using by a long shot.
[106:47.51]No, is that the three round burst one?
[106:49.27]It is.
[106:49.91]Yep.
[106:50.61]Yeah, I like that one.
[106:53.91]Maybe I'm just not using the other one correctly.
[106:57.21]Actually shouldn't even be using it right now.
[107:00.49]The main gate is unprotected.
[107:03.23]Like the mind of the heretic.
[107:10.46]Your voice is terrifying, Smush.
[107:12.78]I love it.
[107:13.54]I need a little help, guys.
[107:15.26]What's up, buddy?
[107:18.58]There's just some dudes that were just... I don't know.
[107:21.08]There's one guy.
[107:21.76]This guy giving you trouble?
[107:23.82]They hurt.
[107:24.20]Alright, I'm good now.
[107:27.31]Thank you.
[107:30.75]You need to block and shove occasionally.
[107:32.51]Yeah.
[107:37.12]I don't block and shove and I'm doing just fine.
[107:43.18]This thing is sick.
[107:47.03]Oh, Criken.
[107:47.55]Do you like... Do you like city builders?
[107:50.91]City builder.
[107:52.94]City Builder D is nuts.
[107:54.38]Like any City Builder type game.
[107:55.64]Oh my God, he got me.
[107:56.54]You're right.
[107:57.78]Oh, you mean like just the genre of games in general?
[108:02.42]Yeah, that genre.
[108:05.16]Yeah, I played City Skylines before.
[108:08.30]Okay.
[108:09.36]I don't know if I played... I got a game recommend... My chat is like, oh God, here we go.
[108:12.78]But I got a good game recommendation.
[108:15.04]It's a city building roguelite that I think you might like.
[108:17.52]Shit, they're too fast.
[108:18.82]City building roguelite.
[108:21.15]Yeah, it's really cool.
[108:22.13]It's my favorite game of the year so far, aside from Elden Ring.
[108:25.16]Really?
[108:25.44]Yeah.
[108:27.94]What is it called?
[108:30.04]I don't want to seem like a shill.
[108:32.46]I'm not a shill.
[108:35.38]I got a movie recommendation for you, but I'm not going to tell you.
[108:37.61]I can't tell you.
[108:39.07]My chat will get angry.
[108:39.93]It's so awesome.
[108:44.34]it's called against the storm I love it I've been playing like every day it's really good nice yeah I'll I'll uh I just want to see more people succumb to the addiction of that game there's so many games not recently I'm like struggling to keep up I've been playing this so much it's like the first hour and a half of a sim city game and then you just keep doing that and it gets more complex and it's wonderful I love it
[109:11.67]Can you guys do me a favor and talk about this game?
[109:14.69]Oh, yeah.
[109:15.69]You want a sponsorship, by the way?
[109:16.77]You better fucking... Excuse me.
[109:19.46]What about this one?
[109:20.52]I wish you'd like to know, Jeremiah.
[109:24.92]I'm a resource of lore.
[109:26.86]It's so funny because you've been playing this a lot.
[109:30.42]You know everything.
[109:32.48]Look, this servitor was turned into a typewriter.
[109:36.43]Yes!
[109:37.23]Yes!
[109:39.53]Hey, don't shoot that.
[109:40.23]This is my new favorite.
[109:41.97]I like this game because in it, you get to shoot.
[109:45.03]That's true.
[109:47.07]I like this game because it seems like... Hold on a minute.
[109:49.56]We've got an issue.
[109:51.52]Hold on.
[109:52.68]Let me handle this.
[109:54.76]Are servitors by choice turn into typewriters?
[109:58.06]No.
[109:58.98]Okay.
[110:00.16]It's usually if you've done a crime like stealing Apple or... You know.
[110:08.45]bumped into the wrong person oh my god so in the warhammer universe like every minor thing like not like overly minor crimes but you can get turned into a typewriter yes that's so ridiculous like the you know like when you're doing that personality quiz to fill out for your character those were like how you ended up in this situation right that's going for mine was like
[110:35.26]I complained about the taste of corpse starch, which is what everyone's given to eat.
[110:41.06]It's literally like melted down people.
[110:43.15]And I was like, the corpse starch is kind of bad today.
[110:46.49]And someone overheard me.
[110:48.77]And then you got arrested.
[110:50.47]That's how I run my rental in colonies.
[110:53.32]People just throw a fit about their bedroom and I give them peg legs.
[110:59.09]Yeah, and not to talk about another game for too long, but in RimWorld, my chat kept wanting me to get the one where you could make people into milkable colonists mod.
[111:09.43]Did you ever use that mod?
[111:11.51]Warhammer takes place in 4100 Malenia.
[111:17.32]The textures are great in this area.
[111:19.54]And the boss we're about to fight here is... Who is it again?
[111:24.25]I don't know, but is he milkable?
[111:26.21]Probably.
[111:28.09]Hey, Snot, you might want this.
[111:33.09]We found the scripture.
[111:34.41]The servitor doesn't want to be here.
[111:36.01]So if we complete the level of finding all these scriptures, then they get bonus EXP and money.
[111:41.56]There's a lot of people over there, and I'm in trouble.
[111:43.78]Can I use this?
[111:45.90]What?
[111:47.87]You can't count beyond three though.
[111:52.22]I guess that makes sense.
[111:57.26]This thing is so fun.
[112:10.42]Should I have pressed it?
[112:11.12]Oh, wait.
[112:11.66]I don't think I should have pressed that.
[112:13.36]Pressed it?
[112:14.10]That?
[112:15.02]Or pressed the button.
[112:16.66]Why?
[112:16.92]I should have pressed that.
[112:18.28]Why am I turning English?
[112:20.26]No, you're role-playing.
[112:21.00]You're fine.
[112:21.58]Yeah, I'm just role-playing.
[112:24.27]That's the credible perk.
[112:26.77]Oh, I should have pressed that one.
[112:32.05]Oh, I see ammo that I really need, but there's a fire around it.
[112:34.77]I know.
[112:35.11]I'm in the same boat as you.
[112:36.87]Oh, who's going to get it first?
[112:38.67]You can have it.
[112:39.31]No, you can have it.
[112:39.81]No, I insist.
[112:42.01]No, take it, take it.
[112:44.76]Okay, fine.
[112:45.94]Yep.
[112:46.98]Yeah, because I think you need it more than I do because you have more suppressing fire than I do.
[112:56.91]I like that because even when I'm missing, I'm still suppressing and I'm missing the most of the time.
[113:02.69]Oh, I'm out of bullets.
[113:08.15]Behind you.
[113:08.61]Behind you, flame.
[113:11.38]Oh god, I'm running.
[113:12.72]I'm the tank.
[113:15.08]Why am I running?
[113:15.64]Because it's a tox flamer, not an actual flamer.
[113:18.68]They're using toxic flame.
[113:20.48]Oh, you're toxic.
[113:22.20]Get off the server.
[113:32.44]I'm chasing this freaking guy.
[113:33.42]Talk more about Warhammer!
[113:35.24]What's the lower of this symbol above the door?
[113:42.54]That's the symbol of the Emperor.
[113:46.08]Why do they have chainsaws on swords?
[113:49.06]That didn't kill him?
[113:50.56]Chainsaw swords.
[113:52.38]I'm down.
[113:53.32]I'm coming.
[113:54.42]I'm coming.
[113:57.26]I'm coming.
[113:57.56]I'm coming.
[113:57.86]I'm coming.
[114:01.97]Ask Criken about the Arco Flagellants for a good time.
[114:06.53]I think your chat may assume I know more than I actually do.
[114:09.49]Oh, okay.
[114:09.83]No.
[114:10.05]You can just make it up and I'll... You're right.
[114:11.73]You're right.
[114:11.99]I'll make it up.
[114:12.75]Ask me then.
[114:14.93]Tell me about the Arcoflagellants.
[114:17.15]Oh.
[114:18.05]The Arcoflagellants.
[114:18.93]Yeah.
[114:19.17]So that's actually a sect of purple inquisitors that slap each other in the Arctic.
[114:29.33]And that's why they're called Arcoflagellants.
[114:32.81]It's nuts.
[114:33.97]I think we have to be in here, right?
[114:35.94]Yeah.
[114:41.49]Somebody said, why do I keep making the BatChest face?
[114:48.46]I haven't made the BatChest face once this whole entire day.
[114:52.10]He's just having a great time.
[114:54.30]Hell yeah.
[114:59.94]You got that close.
[115:01.74]Are there clowns in this universe?
[115:05.16]Actually, yes.
[115:07.13]Insane machines by implanted weapons who constantly feel pain and regret in combat.
[115:12.09]There's like a...
[115:14.30]An assassination, like, order of clown masquerade elf people that, like, are an army that fight chaos.
[115:22.23]Don't the Dark Eldar... The Dark Eldar, like, torture each other, right?
[115:27.43]Or something?
[115:28.15]They're the most bad guy bad guys.
[115:33.66]They torture each other.
[115:35.58]Do they want to be tortured?
[115:37.18]I don't know.
[115:37.76]Maybe.
[115:38.12]Maybe.
[115:39.50]After a certain point, maybe you start to like it.
[115:41.96]I have no idea.
[115:42.54]All I know is I remember they were just like torturing each other and like torturers and shit.
[115:48.14]God, I wouldn't like that.
[115:50.63]Uh-oh.
[115:51.09]What's that sound?
[115:52.17]Oh, you're about to find out.
[115:54.45]What?
[115:55.97]Oh.
[115:56.85]What does that mean?
[115:57.41]I keep getting like beams on the edge of my screen.
[116:01.37]It sounds bad though, doesn't it?
[116:03.30]Yeah.
[116:04.36]What is this?
[116:06.08]Uh, what's that sound?
[116:07.40]Uh-oh.
[116:08.04]It's a pig.
[116:11.21]Kind of reminds me of that movie Event Horizon, which is also not Warhammer 40k.
[116:22.68]What is it?
[116:23.02]Are you hyping this up for no reason?
[116:24.26]Oh my god, it's here!
[116:26.52]What is it?
[116:27.54]It's Sharjah!
[116:27.84]There's a guy with two saw blades for hands!
[116:30.39]It's Nurgle!
[116:31.05]It's Nurgle!
[116:31.53]It's the fucking beast of Nurgle, man!
[116:33.45]It's in the room!
[116:34.45]Oh, it's that thing!
[116:36.37]Oh my god!
[116:37.99]Oh, it's disgusting.
[116:40.81]I'll shoot it on the back.
[116:41.53]I think I'm in him.
[116:45.70]Get me out of here.
[116:47.92]Give him a purple Nurgle.
[116:53.17]On the back.
[116:53.75]The pustule on the back.
[116:56.86]Just puked on me.
[117:04.00]I like his hair.
[117:06.72]Oh my god, he's... Hey, you spit him out.

[117:13.08]What?
[117:14.40]How do I get out of here?

[118:11.44]Remember your ammo.
[118:12.48]I don't have an ammo.
[118:13.30]I have scripture right now.
[118:14.24]Oh, I've got some ammo here, guys.
[118:16.58]Hey, thanks.
[118:16.96]Oh, thank you.
[118:17.54]You just saved us.
[118:18.58]That actually saves us.
[118:20.58]No problem, guys.
[118:21.72]Oh, that's so much ammo that I needed.
[118:24.42]I'm just happy to help.
[118:25.90]I think Smush should... Vinny, you should probably take this.
[118:29.56]I have more.
[118:29.90]You think so?
[118:30.48]Yeah, I have two and a half bars.
[118:32.60]Okay, thank you.
[118:33.96]I just don't even ask anymore.
[118:35.14]I guess I can do it, right?
[118:37.74]How many times can you use this thing?
[118:39.01]Twice?
[118:40.50]It's the amount of pips you see, like the little blue.
[118:46.62]Yo, I just... I just healed and look at my health.
[118:50.91]He just ate a shot from a sniper.
[118:52.95]We keep getting eaten in the head.
[118:55.45]You know what?
[118:56.91]Guys, just kill the sniper.
[118:58.81]Holy crap.
[118:59.73]I was just standing there going, oh, yeah.
[119:04.85]I was a level one player in any BR game.
[119:09.13]I was just like, oh, I just picked up an item.
[119:12.09]Oh, that's really interesting.
[119:13.31]I wonder what it does.
[119:14.97]If you stand still, you're dead.
[119:15.99]I literally just got sniped in PUBG.
[119:22.23]Watch out behind you.
[119:23.04]What was that?
[119:31.36]Flamer somewhere.
[119:32.06]I don't know if we got him, but...
[119:35.43]Oh, he's still here.
[119:36.49]Is he?
[119:36.79]Oh, Lord have mercy.
[119:38.45]You good?
[119:39.43]Don't worry, guys.
[119:40.77]He won't be burning anybody alive anymore.
[119:44.50]Last deal, but you take it.
[119:46.60]Well, that just happened.
[119:50.16]Does anyone else see this?
[119:52.30]You're going to want to see this.
[119:54.10]What are we looking at?
[119:54.84]Yeah, what are you doing?
[119:57.06]I don't know.
[119:57.64]I was a bit.
[120:01.89]They really should hire me for the E3 things, man.
[120:03.59]You can't say shut up and then do +2.
[120:05.34]That's not how it works.
[120:10.78]We could do it.
[120:11.28]You guys want to do an E3 segment?
[120:13.04]Yeah.
[120:13.72]Alright.
[120:16.32]We got a shotgunner.
[120:18.29]Good shot.
[120:19.75]Reloading.
[120:22.18]We're all clear.
[120:22.70]No, maybe not.
[120:23.14]That's a little much.
[120:23.76]I mean, that's not quite E3.
[120:25.52]That's, like, generic, I'm an NPC in the video game.
[120:30.33]I thought that was in the game.
[120:31.73]Got me!
[120:33.23]Alright.
[120:33.73]Okay.
[120:37.07]We're going through.
[120:37.75]Once this opens.
[120:38.91]I wonder what's on the other side of that portal.
[120:40.68]I don't know.
[120:41.90]It's looking a little scary, though.
[120:44.90]One guy right there.
[120:45.68]Nice shot.
[120:47.80]Nice.
[120:49.88]We got another one coming.
[120:50.60]12 o'clock.
[120:51.66]Nice job at 12 o'clock there.
[120:54.22]Healing station as well.
[120:56.30]Nice work, Jerma985.
[120:58.17]Thanks a lot, Vinesauce.
[120:59.21]You need the healing station?
[121:02.17]That's okay.
[121:02.57]I'll take it.
[121:04.37]Nah, you go ahead and take it.
[121:05.19]I think you need a little bit more than we do.
[121:07.55]That's better.
[121:09.80]I might need it too.
[121:11.70]That was close, wasn't it?
[121:14.23]It was.
[121:14.63]Good shot.
[121:16.79]Thanks.
[121:17.29]I'm imagining a horde's gonna come out here soon, guys.
[121:19.23]Just be ready.
[121:19.65]Make sure you have enough ammo.
[121:22.40]I'm ready.
[121:23.00]Ammo's right here.
[121:25.28]We need one more scripture, lads, and then we get them.
[121:28.28]Experience.
[121:29.18]I'm thinking of throwing a grenade down here, but I'm gonna need somebody to cover me before I do it.
[121:33.51]On your back.
[121:34.73]Watching your six.
[121:37.05]Thank you.
[121:38.01]Phew, that was a close one.
[121:42.50]I got a pizza in the oven.
[121:44.12]Alright, you want to take five?
[121:46.18]I bet you'll enjoy that when we're done with our match of Warhammer 40k dark time.
[121:53.15]Hey, come back with that pizza, man.
[121:54.47]There's a lot of freaking zombies here.
[121:57.77]This is not part of the script.
[122:01.05]He actually left.
[122:04.10]Oh, he's actually... It's alright, guys.
[122:05.74]He's actually getting a pizza.
[122:07.48]What is he...
[122:11.23]It's not done yet.
[122:13.79]It's not quite done yet.
[122:19.32]Thanks, man.
[122:19.66]Appreciate it.
[122:21.52]I got 70 ammo, so I'm good to go on that front.
[122:25.64]Big guy coming through here.
[122:26.58]Big guy coming through.
[122:29.62]Alright.
[122:29.90]6 o'clock and 12 o'clock.
[122:31.64]Thank you.
[122:31.97]Nice job.
[122:32.27]Group on the left.
[122:32.71]Could be.
[122:40.65]Also, also, I know that we're recording for the E3 segment, but like, don't fucking talk about that shit.
[122:45.91]Like, I was hungry.
[122:46.91]Like, they'll edit this part out, but like, seriously, guys, like, if I'm hungry, I haven't eaten all day, so just shut the fuck up about it.
[122:52.59]I haven't eaten since fucking, like, 8 o'clock.
[122:56.09]Shut the fuck up.
[122:56.79]It's so fucking annoying.
[123:01.11]Yeah, I mean, just... Alright, so, we'll just get back into it.
[123:07.21]They'll come back here for this part.
[123:10.95]Hey, got some ammo.
[123:12.21]Sorry.
[123:12.49]Can we do that again?
[123:12.99]Ammo here.
[123:13.21]Start over.
[123:13.53]Just start over.
[123:14.13]Just start from... Actually, it's probably... It would be better if you walked from the red room over there.
[123:18.74]Sorry.
[123:19.06]I thought you wanted us to start the sponsorship stream over.
[123:23.82]Help.
[123:25.60]I cannot move!
[123:32.20]Okay.
[123:32.68]This ammo... Sorry.
[123:34.12]I picked it up.
[123:34.68]Fuck.
[123:36.70]Whatever.
[123:37.50]Come on.
[123:38.28]You got this E3 gig coming up.
[123:39.84]Come on.
[123:40.28]Get it together.
[123:41.77]Oh, man.
[123:42.17]I wouldn't be hired for E3.
[123:43.61]Game awards are coming up, lads.
[123:44.93]We got to practice for it.
[123:46.37]Alright.
[123:46.93]Three, two, one.
[123:48.13]Alright.
[123:49.73]We're in the elevator.
[123:51.69]Guys, I need some help.
[123:53.72]Yeah, we'll find some in a second here, man.
[123:57.22]Nice shot.
[123:58.14]Nice shot.
[123:59.44]Thank you.
[124:01.06]Try to stick together, guys.
[124:02.00]We shouldn't get split up here.
[124:03.32]It's a good call.
[124:05.54]The closer we are, the better cohesion we have.
[124:10.62]That's right.
[124:11.18]And that's how you recover your toughness.
[124:12.79]Yeah, we've recovered our energy that way.
[124:14.57]Watch out over this way on the left.
[124:15.51]Group up.
[124:17.53]Gunner down.
[124:19.47]Nice shot.
[124:20.61]You were always the best shooter.
[124:22.39]You were always the best shooter of the group.
[124:24.76]Who?
[124:25.56]Who?
[124:29.40]You can do a tactical crouch if you run and crouch and slide.
[124:33.07]Alright, that's enough.
[124:33.67]I've had enough of this.
[124:35.83]I started getting tense in there.
[124:41.17]I've never seen E3.
[124:42.15]I don't know how.
[124:44.51]Wait, hold on.
[124:45.76]You've never seen E3?
[124:50.42]Do you know what E3 is?
[124:51.28]Is it like a movie?
[124:53.46]Charborg, what does E3 stand for?
[124:55.36]Charborg, were you just actually playing the game and talking to us?
[124:59.12]Yeah, I thought that's what we were doing.
[125:02.50]That made that whole routine 10 times better.
[125:06.58]That's so awesome.
[125:08.04]That's amazing.
[125:09.30]Entertainment, entertainment, entertainment.
[125:12.54]Oh, it's like E to the power of three.
[125:14.86]Yeah.
[125:15.28]Yeah.
[125:16.02]What does it stand for?
[125:16.74]Entertainment Expo or something?
[125:20.14]Electronic entertainment.
[125:21.30]Excellent.
[125:22.38]Excellent.
[125:22.72]Party time.
[125:23.82]Party time.
[125:25.45]Entertainment, entertainment, entertainment.
[125:27.17]Well, if it was E to the third power, wouldn't it be, like... Entertainment, like, times, like, 50 or something?
[125:33.25]Entertainment three.
[125:35.19]So, wait, what is that?
[125:35.89]That's nine entertainments.
[125:37.71]I had it wrong.
[125:38.19]I think that's too much entertainment.
[125:41.04]I was not a math person.
[125:42.58]I don't know math.
[125:44.18]Neither was I. Guys, I have a book.
[125:46.72]Can someone tell me what to do with this?
[125:48.83]Ooh.
[125:49.61]Yeah.
[125:49.73]We need to... If we get all the books to the end of the level, then we all get a bonus experience.
[125:54.35]Yeah.
[125:54.65]So... It's like Gnome Chomsky.
[125:56.35]Yeah.
[125:57.97]Wait.
[125:58.31]There's an actual gnome?
[126:00.59]In Left 4 Dead.
[126:03.21]The environments actually are really cool.
[126:06.91]It's very, very well made.
[126:09.42]I would say.
[126:10.58]The music in this... Oh.
[126:12.22]What in the hell?
[126:15.12]Did I get him?
[126:15.82]I don't know.
[126:16.54]We only have two of the three books though.
[126:18.78]Is there a third book?
[126:20.02]Yeah, we missed one.
[126:21.60]That's okay.
[126:22.32]Ah, damn.
[126:22.82]Do you still get... We get partial credit.
[126:25.60]You do?
[126:25.94]Alright.
[126:27.18]Sorry I need this again.
[126:28.30]But my dude just likes to die.
[126:29.96]It's his favorite hobby.
[126:32.36]Oh, I can only carry one of these.
[126:33.62]Oh, I need... Actually, did anybody need ammo?
[126:36.14]Because I kind of do.
[126:38.40]Yeah, may as well throw it down.
[126:39.52]Oh my goodness.
[126:45.64]Wait, the music in this part is very good.
[126:49.15]Is it hype?
[126:50.45]Yeah.
[126:52.79]I heard a hype dog.
[126:54.78]I thought that was the beginning of the song.
[126:58.44]I thought it was like, I thought it was like barking.
[127:01.00]It's actually who let the dogs out.
[127:02.48]Who made this song?
[127:05.78]I have no idea.
[127:07.44]Was it like Rasta Boy or something?
[127:09.32]I don't know.
[127:09.66]Who was that?
[127:10.54]Some of the boys.
[127:14.78]The Baja Men?
[127:19.20]Was it one Baja Men or multiple?
[127:23.08]I think that information was probably lost to time.
[127:26.84]Now it's unknowable who let the dogs out.
[127:34.60]It's fine.
[127:36.22]Oh my god.
[127:38.48]What is this thing?
[127:41.58]I'm too big.
[127:43.46]Genuinely, we should group up for cohesion.
[127:46.64]Yeah, we actually need to group up for cohesion.
[127:54.10]Alright.
[127:54.62]Now we'll all move across the map to this side.
[127:57.42]Ow.
[128:01.37]They never did figure out to let the dogs out, did they?
[128:04.09]No.
[128:05.51]It's a real shame.
[128:08.43]Alright.
[128:08.89]I got to take care of these guys.
[128:09.91]I'm going in.
[128:13.52]Where are they?
[128:19.36]What did you guys say?
[128:20.88]I don't know.
[128:24.30]That dog was fast.
[128:27.96]Woah!
[128:33.31]Just dodge?
[128:34.47]Oh.
[128:35.17]Yeah, that's right.
[128:36.87]Language.
[128:37.23]Excuse me.
[128:50.75]Copernicus, don't you have something to invent?
[128:53.61]It's pronounced Copernicus.
[128:56.35]Did Copernicus invent something, or was he just like a physics guy?
[128:59.38]Like, what did he do, Copernicus?
[129:00.70]Did he discover the apple?
[129:02.16]I think he was the one that was like, hey, guys, we're in a solar system.
[129:04.86]And they're like, you fucking liar.
[129:06.54]Yeah, yeah, they called him a jerk.
[129:09.16]We need to kill the... We need to hit this thing in the face.
[129:16.45]I'm getting hurt here.
[129:18.93]Yeah, Sun is the center guy.
[129:20.75]And they're like, no, it's not.
[129:22.58]In the Warhammer universe, now, is the Sun the center of the... No, because they're like a galactic civilization.
[129:29.78]No, the Emperor is the center.
[129:31.36]The Moon is the center of the universe.
[129:32.56]Good answer, good answer, good answer.
[129:33.82]Love Emperor.
[129:35.60]Hate everyone else.
[129:37.16]That's a lot of people.
[129:47.35]I know where like a little health thing is.
[129:49.05]I'm going on a mission real quick.
[129:50.23]I'll be right back.
[129:51.03]Oh no.
[129:52.25]Are we getting a pizza?
[129:53.93]Yeah, guys.
[129:55.16]I smell a pizza coming from down this hallway.
[129:57.30]He is fucking so dead.
[130:02.92]Is he gonna make it?
[130:09.51]I got the cysts.
[130:13.67]Oh!
[130:23.58]Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!
[130:31.00]I'm overwhelmed.
[130:37.00]Uhm that scripture dropped.
[130:40.00]I'm gonna go back and grab it.
[130:42.00]Does this heal? Oh it is healing! Who did this?
[130:45.00]That would be me.
[130:47.00]You're awesome.
[130:49.00]I'm gonna just tactical slide into it.
[130:51.00]Oh we stopped doing that bit.
[130:56.31]Where did the scripture go?
[130:57.27]Smelting?
[130:57.65]Yeah, where is it?
[131:00.85]I don't see it anymore.
[131:02.65]Did you grab the scripture?
[131:03.65]Oh, I grabbed it.
[131:04.27]I grabbed it.
[131:05.63]Oh, sorry.
[131:06.05]I see.
[131:08.47]I can't wait to get out of here and read this book, guys.
[131:11.28]Yeah.
[131:14.38]Whoa.
[131:16.34]Gotta push your way to the other side.
[131:27.33]This guy's got a whole lot of health.
[131:30.38]Thanks, man.
[131:30.92]I might pick up the organ.
[131:36.76]Do you see how fucking cool this looks?
[131:39.18]This molten steel.
[131:41.75]Oh, this is going to get hairy, though.
[131:49.97]Someone just said me after Taco Bell.
[131:53.27]Can you push it?
[131:53.73]Oh, you can push him in.
[131:54.50]You can shove him in.
[131:58.96]That's a good play.
[132:00.14]I think if the... Thank you.
[132:01.94]There's a lot of people right now.
[132:03.70]I want like a big axe.
[132:28.61]The axe is really good for, like, bosses and, like, powerful targets, but there are weapons that are more designed for, like, crowds.
[132:37.31]Yeah.
[132:37.72]Nice.
[132:38.80]Nice.
[132:39.44]Nice, nice, nice.
[132:42.90]Does it show how many kills you had?
[132:47.10]Because I definitely was number one, and I want to prove it and see it.
[132:50.75]I don't think they've added that yet, but apparently it's on the way.
[132:53.47]oh dang yeah I was probably up there too bad we can't find out I'm just kidding forgetting I used my ability one time that entire match really yeah I need to I I just keep forgetting oh does show kills now it does total for everyone I think yeah oh cool we had exactly a hundred a thousand exactly one thousand oh wait no it was a thousand I missed a zero that's pretty rare
[133:21.56]It's got to be rare.
[133:23.06]That's got to be rare.
[133:24.20]That's a good omen.
[133:26.10]Oh, my God.
[133:26.56]I have a grenade gauntlet.
[133:29.53]Oh, yeah.
[133:29.83]Those are fun.
[133:30.51]That sounds fun.
[133:35.27]Ah, sweet.
[133:35.85]Just got some fresh loot.
[133:37.17]My drops aren't loading.
[133:40.11]Maybe refresh.
[133:40.81]Maybe you have to reconnect your account or something.
[133:43.68]It should be on.
[133:44.70]Can we confirm that the drops actually have been on and working?
[133:47.42]They're working?
[133:47.82]Okay.
[133:49.04]Yeah, mine was working on mine.
[133:50.36]Cool.
[133:52.21]I really would like to get your drops as well.
[133:55.95]I got two drops.
[133:57.69]Cool.
[134:01.59]Oh, I have a cutscene.
[134:03.03]Be right back.
[134:04.57]Ooh.
[134:04.71]I don't have a cutscene, but I'll be right back in one minute.
[134:13.61]Yeah, so this is... This is fun.
[134:19.35]I like it.
[134:20.57]I have a cutscene too.
[134:21.23]Shh.
[134:22.07]Recruit has reported for briefing as instructed.
[134:25.75]Recruit is 42.42 seconds late.
[134:29.69]I already saw this one.
[134:30.65]Recruits have been executed for less.
[134:33.22]This unit will request permission to do so.
[134:38.34]The recruit is expected to achieve competence in regard to technical apparatus.
[134:44.39]I'm curious about this.
[134:50.13]In order to perform their duties at the maximum level of efficiency.
[134:54.05]I think I'm level 4, right?
[134:59.71]You check your pizza.
[135:00.40]It's alright.
[135:15.83]Alright, you've started to make a name for yourself.
[135:17.59]Reach trust level 8.
[135:19.63]You've unlocked the shrine of... Okay, so there's the shrine.
[135:22.71]Actually, let me come back and take... 20 of 163 on the... Oh god, that's a very small amount.
[135:30.18]So yeah, I just unlocked the ability to upgrade or do whatever this is.
[135:34.86]The shrine.
[135:35.98]Oh, I have this too.
[135:39.52]Maybe I don't want any of these.
[135:41.20]I'm just gonna...
[135:43.26]You know, I'll just wait.
[135:44.48]I'll earn more money and I'll buy a different weapon when they refresh.
[135:48.70]Oh, because wait, what's consequence?
[135:51.28]So it basically with this thing, it's like once you find a weapon you like, you can theoretically just keep upgrading it.
[135:57.81]Oh, and it uses this currency.
[136:01.55]Where's that person?
[136:04.87]It's over... It's kind of right out the... Let's see if I can find you.
[136:08.26]It's literally... If you go to the big green room... And just... There's a hallway.
[136:13.68]You just turn... It's like... It's literally like two feet away.
[136:17.98]Oh, here.
[136:18.56]Okay, I see.
[136:19.00]There's like a robot that's five or six slots.
[136:28.24]I don't think I want to do anything.
[136:30.65]Yeah, I'm worried to lock into something and start upgrading if I find something better.
[136:34.51]Yeah, you unfortunately kind of just have to level a bunch to get more options before you start spending the resources, so.
[136:41.24]I imagine you probably just get resources and it's not too terrible, right?
[136:46.24]Yeah, they only added resources like a few days ago, so.
[136:48.86]Oh wow, okay.
[136:49.32]Yeah, that's still like that whole grind is new.
[136:52.83]What is this new part?
[136:55.09]I'll get I'll upgrade this one.
[136:57.24]If you guys want to learn how to get new cosmetics, I can explain that quick.
[137:03.76]I'm inching ever so close to buying that grenade.
[137:06.62]How may I serve?
[137:08.76]Plus 5% sprint efficiency.
[137:09.68]If you want to buy the pants, you can also earn them by doing achievements.
[137:13.87]And every class has their own achievements.
[137:15.75]So if you go to... Penances.
[137:17.23]Yeah, penances.
[137:17.95]Press escape, go to penances, class, and then pick your class.
[137:23.13]And it'll give like a little description.
[137:24.47]So for me, it was like, while dashing, kill a mutant with a melee attack.
[137:27.93]And I get a shirt for that.
[137:30.73]Oh, I just unlocked a weapon, but I don't see it here.
[137:33.96]Kill three enemies with a frag grenade without it bouncing.
[137:36.30]Interesting.
[137:36.96]And you unlock shirt for that.
[137:40.36]yeah I see during a single use of volley fire hit the weak spot of four enemies with a weapon secondary action without missing a shot damn oh some of these are gonna take me a while wait what it's I unlocked a weapon but I don't have it and it's not at the store so you unlocked a weapon class
[138:04.22]Oh, it's just... Meaning you can now buy it.
[138:07.41]But it won't be in the store all the time, I think, because the weapons refresh.
[138:11.51]Oh, okay.
[138:12.75]But I think, Jerma, at level four or five, I think four, you get a free weapon.
[138:17.89]Also, the shop refreshes in one minute, so if it's not in there now, it might be in one minute.
[138:24.28]Your pizza is ready?
[138:25.12]I'll go get it.
[138:27.72]Hold on.
[138:29.74]I don't know if this pizza is real.
[138:31.58]Yeah, I just heard the ding.
[138:35.82]I don't know either.
[138:36.44]Let me just eat it real quick.
[138:38.66]He's gonna eat the whole pizza real quick.
[138:42.72]Oh, God.
[138:45.34]He did it.
[138:46.12]Ow, hot.
[138:47.17]Fuck.
[138:47.73]He did it off camera.
[138:51.77]Jerma's scared of his own oven.
[138:54.15]Huh?
[138:55.45]How was the za?
[138:58.15]It's frozen on the bottom and the top was burning hot.
[139:00.58]But I managed to...
[139:04.00]I don't know.
[139:04.28]I have this little oven over here that only heats from the top.
[139:06.64]And I don't know.
[139:07.44]I just put it in there.
[139:10.46]It's like an easy bake oven.
[139:11.92]Vinny, if you get the right components, you can build the Chevalma.
[139:17.87]Why do I think that's something like Ligma?
[139:21.95]Like, are you tricking me into saying something, chat member?
[139:25.13]I guess the weapon should probably be refreshed, right?
[139:28.41]Oh, 25 seconds.
[139:30.27]Make your final purchases.
[139:32.95]If you see a rare in there, should you just get it?
[139:35.71]No, it eventually becomes a much higher chance for rares and purples and stuff.
[139:40.77]So are there legendaries?
[139:42.90]Yeah, there's legendaries.
[139:44.42]I don't have any yet.
[139:46.44]You just started speaking my language here.
[139:48.60]Oh, yeah.
[139:49.80]Where are the new weapons going to be?
[139:51.40]Oh, what I see, I see.
[139:54.79]One second.
[139:56.48]Zero seconds.
[139:58.62]Oh, this is definitely different.
[140:00.48]Okay.
[140:04.18]What does it mean if it's on the black market?
[140:05.74]I don't know which one.
[140:11.99]Ranged weak spot?
[140:13.13]Probably this one.
[140:14.89]Although the ammo is kind of terrible for this one.
[140:21.74]What do you guys think?
[140:26.77]What I think are these going to be different for all of us?
[140:29.73]Yeah.
[140:31.26]Hey, Chad.
[140:35.02]Can I assist you with my money?
[140:38.28]Auto guns are a trap, really, besides the braced, braced auto gun.
[140:42.27]Oh, OK.
[140:45.41]So maybe wait a little longer.
[140:46.65]I'm going to save my money.
[140:52.87]I get a new flamer.
[140:55.98]Or hammer.
[141:00.13]Oh, shit.
[141:00.89]So wait, it's like a punch gauntlet?
[141:03.47]Like an explosive gauntlet or something?
[141:04.93]That's cool.
[141:08.23]Very cool.
[141:09.31]How you guys doing?
[141:10.67]You still around for another one, Vinny?
[141:11.71]Are you going to take off?
[141:13.30]No, I got to take off.
[141:15.28]I'm sorry.
[141:16.30]No, it's all good.
[141:17.50]Thanks for playing.
[141:17.94]Today's been a very busy day.
[141:19.16]No, thank you for the invite, man.
[141:20.80]I like this game.
[141:21.80]I was probably going to get it anyway, so I'm just happy to play with you.
[141:26.24]This is cool.
[141:27.94]Yeah.
[141:29.58]Yeah, so have fun, Jerma.
[141:31.16]I'll catch you later.
[141:32.38]Criken, Charborg, you guys are great, too.
[141:35.30]I hope to see you again in some sus among us.
[141:39.24]You got it, man.
[141:41.40]Bye.
[141:41.95]Have fun.
[141:43.31]Bye, guys.
[141:43.67]Bye-bye.
[141:45.57]So do we have another fourth, or are we going to just do matchmaking?
[141:49.03]I can ping some people.
[141:50.93]We might have one.
[141:53.21]I think, Criken, are these staffs cool?
[141:56.72]uh yeah they're like for staff it sounds badass I think they're like you can channel like a lightning or fire I haven't tried to myself yet but they look fun uh how do I invite somebody can I just do it just from what you have to be later yeah um anyone can invite within the group okay cool because I think uh I think I got a yeah I got uh one of my mods uh VRJosh is done okey doke oops
[142:27.46]So just go, I can just invite him from here.
[142:35.59]Okay, so.
[142:39.95]Invite.
[142:40.41]I think I just did it.
[142:43.07]Alright, he'll be here in a second.
[142:48.16]Let me actually drag him into this call.
[143:02.57]There we go.
[143:08.03]Where did you say the little place to test the weapon is?
[143:12.72]The meat grinder.
[143:13.62]What's up, man?
[143:13.90]What's up?
[143:14.56]Hello.
[143:15.34]Hello.
[143:16.30]Yeah, this is VRJosh.
[143:18.72]Hello, VRJosh.
[143:19.74]Hello.
[143:20.06]I think I've met Criken before, yeah, in VRJosh a few years ago.
[143:23.79]Yeah.
[143:25.41]I know VRJosh.
[143:26.65]Did you get the invite, Josh?
[143:28.04]yeah I just uh gotta get the game started sweet I've already done the tutorial and everything so oh so you're you're a seasoned player I think then right well I mean I've got the first tutorial round and then the first match they throw you into but yeah I'm into that okay cool this is you I'm assuming right this uh virtuous yeah alright so what mission should we do
[143:51.66]Well, I'd say once you guys get level five, then we could start a tier three mission.
[143:58.01]It will be difficult at five, but it's doable.
[144:01.67]People are saying that mod busy, we can do whatever we want.
[144:08.93]That's not how it works.
[144:09.85]There's not just one mod here.
[144:12.09]I can't find this training arena.
[144:25.02]Is there a refresher?
[144:25.96]Oh, okay.
[144:27.06]Cool.
[144:29.77]Repair, repair.
[144:32.77]Assassination was kind of cool.
[144:35.79]Yeah.
[144:37.47]We got... Depends if you want one with lights on or lights off.
[144:43.92]I think light's on.
[144:44.92]I don't think we're skilled enough as new players to handle the darkness.
[144:49.76]Yeah, it also sucks because you can't use other weapons.
[144:53.88]Like, just having to use the one gun with the flashlight.
[144:56.51]Yeah, I will say, though, that is actually a really cool mechanic to put in the game because they can just keep doing weird shit like that.
[145:05.63]Like, oh, today, um, a grenade just fell from the sky every five seconds.
[145:10.61]Like, they can do cool, wacky shit like that, I think.
[145:12.95]That's pretty cool.
[145:14.79]Because you said those missions are playable just normally, right?
[145:18.49]Uh, yeah.
[145:19.19]No, I think there's definitely the potential for, like, a whole bunch of modifiers later on.
[145:24.94]That's cool.
[145:27.18]Oh, wait, I didn't do I put my weapon on.
[145:30.04]No, you're in here.
[145:31.62]Oh, everyone here.
[145:32.52]Oh, yeah, looks like it.
[145:33.62]You can also put your weapon on if you press I and then you can equip it.
[145:36.59]Oh, my God.
[145:37.23]I look so cool.
[145:39.89]You don't look any different.
[145:42.95]What?
[145:43.35]Wait, where's my sword?
[145:44.37]Oh, my God.
[145:45.31]Wait till we get in there, guys.
[145:46.99]If you didn't have a crush on me before, you might just have one now.
[145:49.73]As soon as we get in there.
[145:53.56]I look so cool.
[145:54.86]It's just like you have the same shirt and pants on.
[145:56.86]You just have like a different weapon in your hand.
[145:59.46]You'll see when we get in game.
[146:00.72]You'll see.
[146:02.26]Rest assured.
[146:05.27]God, I can't wait to get some better clothing options, though.
[146:08.93]I look kind of dweebish.
[146:09.97]Yeah, Criken, did you buy that costume?
[146:13.29]No, I did the achievements for it, which is like just doing special challenges in the level.
[146:18.72]Cool.
[146:24.17]Are you learning to count?
[146:25.65]Yeah, he's learning to count with his fingers.
[146:28.09]The servitor is just like insulting the Ogryn.
[146:31.46]Yeah.
[146:32.46]So apparently in lore, the smartest Ogryn can count to four.
[146:38.78]Really?
[146:39.60]That's literally the smartest Ogryn out there.
[146:41.34]He can get to four.
[146:42.04]I don't understand what that fifth finger is.
[146:44.32]Yeah, he's working his way there.
[146:45.70]Look, there he is.
[146:46.94]Look at the staff.
[146:47.56]Wow.
[146:48.32]Nice.
[146:49.12]Oh, he can only count to four on his finger.
[146:50.76]He just like... Oh, my goodness, guys.
[146:56.79]This is... Whoa.
[146:58.83]I'm like a wizard now.
[146:59.89]Look up at the skybox in this one.
[147:02.65]Alright.
[147:02.87]That's pretty cool.
[147:04.37]This is the best weapon in the game.
[147:05.86]Yeah, unfortunately, guys.
[147:08.58]Unfortunately, you guys aren't me.
[147:10.09]Sorry.
[147:10.49]Let me see.
[147:11.75]What do you got?
[147:12.23]Yeah, there's a Space Marine statue down that way.
[147:16.17]I'll go take a look.
[147:17.61]Alright.
[147:17.95]Sorry, Chad.
[147:18.49]The smartest Auburn can write his name and count to ten.
[147:21.09]I was off by six.
[147:23.41]Look up.
[147:26.94]Wait, we're inside of a motherboard.
[147:29.96]This is what the rat in my PC sees.
[147:33.37]It basically builds cities on top of cities in this universe because there's just too many people and over time it expands too much.
[147:39.61]That's just another city up there.
[147:42.37]Is it upside down or something?
[147:44.49]It is.
[147:44.85]It feels like it's upside down.
[147:46.79]Mirrored or something.
[147:47.51]That's weird.
[147:49.61]I would hate to live here, dude.
[147:51.25]I would get so bullied.
[147:53.09]This would be tough.
[147:55.17]I would get so bullied.
[148:01.29]I mean, you fucking go into school with your, like, staff and pajamas.
[148:08.34]I got my stupid little onesie on, my yellow onesie.
[148:15.04]Yeah, they would instantly turn me into one of those servitor toilets.
[148:22.52]This thing is so cool.
[148:23.82]Alright.
[148:24.24]It's also a melee weapon.
[148:28.92]Oh, the gauntlet.
[148:29.84]Oh, that's cool.
[148:30.56]You can just club them with it.
[148:31.92]Oh, yeah.
[148:34.38]That's so cool.
[148:35.20]I think the reason it's hand-mounted is so that you don't misplace it.
[148:38.48]I remember hearing the lore.
[148:40.23]Oh, so it's attached to me so I don't have to drop it.
[148:42.55]So you don't accidentally drop it someplace.
[148:46.23]I think I'm going to upgrade Andy on this one, I think.
[148:49.67]Yeah.
[148:51.76]Oh, it's got a forward punch as well.
[148:53.38]What's the charge?
[148:53.90]It feels so good when you find a weapon that you mesh well with, you know?
[148:57.02]Yeah, that's how I feel about this staff.
[148:59.62]the game has changed there's other staffs too so like if you start using this one and then try other ones later the call out of barrel
[149:25.76]The magic looks awesome from the staff.
[149:27.76]It looks cool, but I really feel like I'm doing nothing for the team here.
[149:31.43]I think it leaves a burning area on the ground or something.
[149:38.33]Oh, yeah.
[149:39.13]That looks cool.
[149:41.51]Yeah, that just happened.
[149:44.23]I didn't quite finish that part, but I did kind of say that.
[149:48.59]You're right.
[149:50.01]Playing with your head.
[149:51.29]Yeah, that...
[149:53.60]just happened god damn it I think it's cool though just get a bunch of those and then you can just rotate the people you hear that what's that is one of the uh the slime slug people oh yeah holy that just happened uh we got a big one guys we gotta you're gonna want to see this they slug now it's coming for me
[150:25.74]Why is he coming for me?
[150:26.82]Get him away from me.
[150:30.82]Leave me alone.
[150:32.07]I didn't see it, but I heard you scream.
[150:46.38]Okay.
[150:47.48]Where am I?
[150:48.02]No.
[150:48.40]It's like when your dog gets a hold of something.
[150:51.30]Drop it.
[150:51.60]Drop it.
[150:58.45]Wait, what?
[150:58.81]Huh?
[150:58.93]I'm experimentally vaping.
[151:00.17]That's a very weird way to say I started smoking.
[151:05.93]I'm experimentally vaping, you know, just an experiment.
[151:25.38]yeah I think he's saying that he's vaping not like vapes though he's like I'll smoke whatever too he's juicing he's juicing whatever cricket oh yeah gross you ever vape a cricket I saw a dude in a video who vaped like uh like a chili pepper
[151:46.01]He's still okay.
[151:47.51]I don't know how he's doing, but he did not seem to be liking it too much.
[151:51.72]He didn't like it.
[151:52.73]Okay.
[151:58.36]You're gonna blow some fat clouds, man.
[152:01.36]I think that's probably how he talked the rest of his life.
[152:05.80]Yeah, it just permanently ruined his vocal cords.
[152:10.26]It just kind of seeps out of you.
[152:11.66]Yeah.
[152:13.60]Just your sweat becomes spicy.
[152:15.87]Anyone around you just starts like crying.
[152:18.71]Like an onion.
[152:19.87]A walking onion.
[152:24.75]I can't wait till they can start doing body augmentations and stuff.
[152:28.37]Yeah, dude.
[152:29.46]Have you, have you vaped an onion yet?
[152:30.72]No, I haven't.
[152:32.68]I haven't yet.
[152:34.06]One day.
[152:35.34]Ow.
[152:35.88]Uh-oh, I'm in trouble.
[152:37.52]Oh, uh, tank.
[152:38.86]I'm in trouble.
[152:39.48]I'm in trouble.
[152:40.02]I'm in trouble.
[152:40.56]That's not a tank.
[152:41.80]This isn't Left 4 Dead.
[152:45.16]It's a tanky character.
[152:48.54]There you go.
[152:54.86]Oh my god, the staff.
[152:58.18]I was born for this staff.
[153:00.78]It's all the same names, but in Latin, right?
[153:04.04]Different potato chip flavors.
[153:05.46]Salt and vinegar vape.
[153:06.90]Barbecue vape.
[153:10.79]Barbecue.
[153:14.59]Sour cream and onion vape.
[153:15.99]Do you think you could, like, in your last will and testament be turned into a vape juice and have, like... That's so weird.
[153:23.06]Smoke you.
[153:25.00]Yeah, they like juice me and then I'm like, concentrate.
[153:30.60]Roasted turkey vape?
[153:34.17]Dude, yeah, they're really missing out on doing a whole line of like Thanksgiving themed vapes.
[153:40.31]Thanks to like holiday vapes, like Christmas vape, partridge in a pear tree vape.
[153:44.60]Partridge in a pear tree vape.
[153:47.50]Wow, I can really taste the partridge.
[153:49.88]I don't know what a partridge is.
[153:50.94]Is that a bird?
[153:51.68]It's a bird.
[153:52.90]Dude, if they made a Thanksgiving Day vape, the person would be like, well, let me try that one.
[153:56.87]Passing it around the table.
[154:00.21]Oh, does your friend want a plate?
[154:02.37]And he's like, no, I've got this.
[154:04.57]And it's just a nasty Thanksgiving turkey vape.
[154:07.85]Oh, dude, that one was intense.
[154:10.29]Everyone's eating and enjoying their time, and he's blowing fat clouds over the table.
[154:15.36]Is there enough for me?
[154:16.26]Jesus.
[154:18.46]The ammo stash here if someone wants to carry that.
[154:20.67]Anyone got health, I'm hurting.
[154:22.05]There's literally a health station right here, snot.
[154:25.51]I really feel bad taking it from them though because they're being tortured and all that.
[154:28.96]We got nothing else to do.
[154:31.10]That one was so gross.
[154:32.24]And then it's like add to cart like plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus.
[154:38.06]I might go down this avenue.
[154:40.33]Do hardcore vapers like the stankiest vapes?
[154:46.31]What's a good vape?
[154:48.09]That's actually a good question.
[154:50.27]Is it like robust?
[154:55.50]Oh, you want to vape a Toxflame?
[154:57.18]Yeah, Toxflame.
[154:57.80]Alright, that's actually perfect.
[154:59.88]That's unbelievably funny.
[155:01.46]Plus a thousand to the person in chat that just said this.
[155:04.94]Harry Potter Jelly Bean vape.
[155:08.40]You never know what you're going to get.
[155:11.00]Are you wax gross?
[155:12.94]Is this marshmallow or stinky sock vape?
[155:15.72]Stinky sock juice.
[155:17.92]That's so stupid.
[155:20.44]Black mold vape.
[155:21.48]What did you get, man?
[155:22.52]It just gives you like a terminal illness.
[155:25.06]Yeah, this one's either licorice or black mold.
[155:29.95]And then you try it and you just die about it.
[155:37.57]That's going to show up on SNL now.
[155:43.08]A lot of people over here.
[155:52.74]This thing actually is everything I wanted.
[155:54.67]It's awesome.
[155:57.07]I love the sound it makes.
[155:57.81]What is the fire like other than the melee?
[156:00.77]Little grenades.
[156:01.21]Oh, it's like a cannon.
[156:02.13]Yeah.
[156:03.57]It's fun to use.
[156:04.90]Oh, so for this one, the thing is going to go down, and one of us has to use it to start a mini game, turn it back on again, like it is right now.
[156:13.37]So, I can either do it, or let's have one of you guys do it, and then I will try to hold on to you.
[156:17.99]Wait, what the hell is this?
[156:19.49]So, you've got to click when it's highlighting over the glowy bit, right?
[156:24.97]Oh, okay.
[156:27.08]Guys, I'm getting hurt a real bad.
[156:29.10]Should we have let the person that can't count to four do this?
[156:33.22]Technically, Ogryns are the slowest at doing it than anyone.
[156:36.02]Oh, are they really?
[156:37.58]Yeah.
[156:39.62]There's literally one guy here.
[156:41.17]What happened?
[156:42.29]Yeah, well, there were plenty more, but I managed to take him out while I was down.
[156:51.85]Ow.
[156:52.97]What is this?
[156:54.33]Get out of here.
[156:57.16]Alright, I'll do it.
[156:58.26]Somebody protect me.
[157:00.54]Protecting.
[157:03.75]There's no one even here anymore.
[157:04.87]They got tired of us.
[157:07.79]I promise I'm not doing this wrong.
[157:09.27]It is really slow.
[157:14.11]Dude, I love this stuff.
[157:19.04]Anybody have any ammo?
[157:21.28]Thank you.
[157:23.16]Did you guys think you could learn magic when you were younger?
[157:29.28]I would really practice telekinetic stuff.
[157:32.18]Dude, like real magic?
[157:33.57]You wanted to move stuff?
[157:34.81]Yeah, when I was little, I really wanted to be magic.
[157:37.07]You ever get close?
[157:38.61]In that same world... You did what?
[157:41.74]In that same world, when I was younger, I wanted to be a magic wand maker.
[157:48.74]But this is way before that, though.
[157:50.70]Before he existed, you're like, you invented the concept.
[157:53.16]Well, by the way, this is not like Harry Potter-style magic.
[157:56.80]This is, I think, magicians on stage magic.
[158:00.57]You know what I mean?
[158:01.01]I think there's probably a pretty big market for that.
[158:04.35]What is involved with making a wand?
[158:06.23]I don't know.
[158:08.23]I wish I could ask my former self.
[158:09.25]You gotta be able to, like, pull little handkerchiefs out of it.
[158:11.47]There's gotta be a secret compartment or two.
[158:15.40]Yeah.
[158:15.68]I need to brush up on like magic stuff.
[158:18.00]It's not just like you want it to be a magician.
[158:20.62]You want it to provide a service to magicians despite not knowing how the magic works itself.
[158:25.90]Like you didn't know the first step of making it.
[158:28.33]You wanted to provide it.
[158:30.45]Not at all.
[158:31.73]Oh.
[158:32.23]Yeah, I just figured I wanted to be a magic wand maker, not a magician.
[158:37.79]That's how you make the money in the magic world, right?
[158:40.03]That's good business sense.
[158:41.31]Smart kid.
[158:47.27]The people who made it rich in the gold rush were the ones selling the mining supplies.
[158:50.74]Mm-hmm.
[158:51.66]Yeah.
[158:52.58]Reload, please.
[159:07.84]Oh, also, we're looking for grimoires.
[159:09.36]I totally forgot to even mention that.
[159:11.18]They're like little flowy books.
[159:14.36]Oh, that's for like extra... Yeah, that's for extra experience at the end.
[159:17.68]Probably already missed one, but... It's okay.
[159:21.36]No, I feel like we'll get all three this time.
[159:23.45]We're capable.
[159:24.77]All three out of two.
[159:26.75]All three out of two.
[159:31.48]Let's get some... I want more.
[159:34.02]I want more ammo on this thing.
[159:37.00]I'm definitely going to upgrade it.
[159:41.30]It's addicting.
[159:42.90]Oh, here's that ammo right here.
[159:44.46]Shut up!
[159:45.37]Oh, jeez.
[159:46.09]Okay.
[160:07.05]What's his story?
[160:11.56]That guy was hiding.
[160:12.80]That one's for decoration.
[160:15.90]Dude, that's so... I want to be like a live, laugh, love servital.
[160:22.85]Like an embroidered pillow?
[160:24.39]Yeah.
[160:25.25]A throw pillow?
[160:29.91]That would not be a bad existence.
[160:32.31]Unless it's painful.
[160:34.54]I'm sure it's very painful.
[160:36.10]You know, probably having your nerves bound to metal would probably suck.
[160:40.74]I think the process, most lose consciousness and aren't sentient anymore, but some retain it somehow and are just perpetually in the black hole.
[160:50.93]That would be my luck.
[160:51.93]I would still feel it, probably.
[160:53.07]Yeah, with your luck?
[160:54.19]Yeah.
[160:57.33]Hey.
[160:59.35]Where are you?
[160:59.73]Who?
[161:03.43]This guy shooting from across the balcony over there.
[161:10.87]Ammo here.
[161:12.45]I think I got enough.
[161:14.39]I can't use ammo anymore.
[161:15.91]I'm now a spiritual being.
[161:17.62]I cast, I cast magic.
[161:20.72]That actually seems like kind of a fun character.
[161:23.82]That seems like a fun character actually.
[161:25.80]It is.
[161:26.18]It's pretty cool.
[161:28.34]I love this little spell ability.
[161:31.50]Oh, is this heal?
[161:35.59]No, never mind.
[161:36.07]It's just a computer.
[161:38.65]This way?
[161:41.01]I don't know.
[161:41.95]We're down where they're at.
[161:46.23]Are we going the right way or are you guys going the right way?
[161:50.05]It's down here where Snotme is.
[161:53.18]Why am I the only one that gets snagged by this little bug zapper now?
[161:56.86]Oh this fire goodbye This is the worst oh I'm fine.
[162:08.23]I'll be fine.
[162:09.29]Wait, how did I get back up?
[162:11.69]I think you can help you can uh, press e grenade There's something green back here
[162:23.01]Oh, is that a tome?
[162:24.35]I think I got one of the... Oh, you did.
[162:26.59]Nice.
[162:28.74]So if you die with it, it goes away forever.
[162:32.42]But there's healing over here.
[162:34.74]Where's snot down?
[162:36.22]Oh, down there.
[162:37.04]Yeah, what's that thing on the map?
[162:38.92]It's like an icon.
[162:39.96]What's that?
[162:40.34]Oh, yeah, snot.
[162:40.86]You should get this too.
[162:42.44]What icon?
[162:44.05]Oh, it's the heal icon.
[162:44.97]Okay.
[162:53.05]That guy didn't even know he died.
[163:07.22]Everything you've told me so far makes me want to learn about the lore of Warhammer.
[163:11.55]Yeah, right?
[163:12.33]It's addicting once you learn a little bit.
[163:15.17]Uh, my two favorite concepts in Warhammer are, like, hive cities, which is where we are, and then, uh, just, like, how distance works and, like, time is really actually original.
[163:28.48]And you can hit by the train.
[163:29.80]So, like, go through the warp and, like, come out years later sometimes, like... Yeah, it's, like, inconsistent.
[163:35.88]Yeah.
[163:36.32]I don't want to waste demo.
[163:38.32]Yeah, I've definitely fallen down the, uh... Oh, look, it's a servitor radio.
[163:41.36]Wait, wait, let me talk to him.
[163:45.09]Nothing in there.
[163:45.57]Dude, what a funny idea, just like punishing people by turning them into shit.
[163:55.05]That is so funny.
[163:55.91]I want to be a little dude.
[163:59.12]I need to make an entire game about being a servitor.
[164:04.12]You just stand around?
[164:06.88]Yeah.
[164:09.42]You just watch people go and have fun.
[164:11.92]I can't hit anybody.
[164:14.86]Come on, man.
[164:20.92]It would be like prop hunt, but you don't move.
[164:30.21]You're so, so bad.
[164:31.47]No, you wouldn't have said anything unless I said that first.
[164:35.85]I saw that.
[164:39.96]That person was running behind you.
[164:44.85]If I'm rushing ahead too much, just let me know.
[164:46.31]I'll chill.
[164:46.69]I'm just playing a speedy, nice guy.
[164:49.55]No, no.
[164:49.94]You're good.
[164:50.28]Oh boy.
[165:08.85]Oh, there's ammo back here if you want it.
[165:10.85]Ow!
[165:12.53]Watch that.
[165:15.50]Oh, thank goodness.
[165:19.16]I kind of... I want to play as the Flamethrower guy eventually.
[165:27.56]Yeah.
[165:27.92]Seems fun.
[165:28.35]He plays like the Ogryn, kind of.
[165:30.21]Like, he charges in and deals with wards really well.
[165:37.35]What am I doing?
[165:37.83]Help me.
[165:38.53]Oh my god.
[165:39.65]I almost blew myself up.
[165:40.37]That's a lot of people.
[165:43.60]Holy shit.
[165:44.14]Just shove them off.
[165:46.14]Oh yeah.
[165:46.46]I can get... There's a challenge from my character to shove a bunch of people off.
[165:49.96]Yeah.
[165:50.18]I want to try that.
[165:52.10]I completely forgot about the challenge.
[165:53.40]That's how you unlock pants and stuff.
[165:55.70]Yeah.
[165:56.19]I'm going to get a nice little pair of Balenciaga belt.
[166:01.25]This music.
[166:01.87]Listen to this.
[166:03.67]Go get it, man.
[166:20.18]I need that.
[166:21.72]That's not very much ammo, though.
[166:22.90]What the heck?
[166:24.37]What the heck?
[166:25.81]It's like a good place for a grimoire.
[166:35.09]Yeah, I feel like I'm so worried I'm missing it.
[166:38.65]Yeah.
[166:39.03]When I saw it, it was glowing green, and it was behind the boxes, the other one, so...
[166:45.30]As soon as we get out of here, we should gather around a little campfire and read the grimoire to each other.
[166:49.20]There's a lot of dorks over here.
[166:50.62]Help.
[166:50.80]A lot of dorks?
[166:53.22]Yeah.
[166:54.18]I bet you were a bully in high school.
[166:55.80]I bet you were a high school bully.
[166:59.38]The guy.
[166:59.82]The guy.
[167:00.58]The guy that wanted to make magician's wands.
[167:02.82]Yeah.
[167:04.98]Yeah.
[167:05.40]Oh, yeah.
[167:06.60]I was such a young... I was such a bully.
[167:08.45]You know, the guy that wanted to make the magic.
[167:10.89]What the fuck just happened?
[167:12.45]Just a bomber.
[167:14.25]Dived in.
[167:15.77]We're all pretty freaked up, huh?
[167:17.21]Yeah, we need some healing.
[167:18.25]Does anyone have a box?
[167:19.67]Copernicus, you do.
[167:20.95]I do.
[167:21.57]We might want to find an actual heal station.
[167:25.12]Gather around, everyone.
[167:28.48]Oh, that's helpful.
[167:32.94]Uh-oh.
[167:38.42]Nice.
[167:41.05]Does that box not heal if you've got purple?
[167:43.28]Yeah.
[167:43.60]Only these stations heal the purple.
[167:45.54]Oh, Lark.
[167:51.08]I'm taking all the ammo.
[167:52.03]I feel bad.
[167:53.03]No, that's cool.
[167:54.67]I've got, like, 200, 300.
[167:56.57]I like using this one because I don't need ammo.
[167:58.35]I just... I'm just channeling, like, energy.
[168:06.66]Careful.
[168:07.16]Sorry, Copernicus.
[168:08.62]What am I actually doing?
[168:10.78]Oh, I was groaning again.
[168:12.46]Not funny.
[168:13.00]I thought you were getting mad because I was butchering the lord.
[168:16.81]Call it the right thing, snot.
[168:20.07]It's called garbly chokes.
[168:23.35]Garbly chokes levels are low.
[168:26.13]Eat shit!
[168:31.94]You know what?
[168:32.30]Fuck it.
[168:32.54]I'm going in.
[168:34.50]That's how I feel all the time.
[168:50.00]Ammo?
[168:52.22]Never mind, there's no ammo here.
[168:53.19]I didn't find any.
[168:55.65]Your character said ammo time.
[168:58.55]Ammo time.
[168:58.87]Wait, am I insane?
[168:59.93]I straight up think he said ammo time.
[169:02.55]I must have had a fucking glitch with your computer, dude.
[169:06.13]That's weird.
[169:12.04]Does the bloom get more intense if you're very low on health?
[169:16.71]Feels like my guy's under a bar.
[169:19.15]It's a little fuzzy around the edges now.
[169:23.45]Yeah, I feel like I just smoked a pepper.
[169:25.21]It's a big chest over here.
[169:31.07]Alright, we can all heal here now.
[169:35.09]Nice.
[169:38.26]Guys, they're trying to break in.
[169:39.54]No, it's not.
[169:40.40]Heal.
[169:41.26]Is that them actually trying to break in?
[169:42.54]I don't know.
[169:43.68]It sounds like it, but I can't see them looking over here.
[169:46.87]They're doing something out here.
[169:48.01]There's a lot of really cool environmental stuff going on.
[169:49.99]It's just the drum class.
[169:52.49]The drum class?
[169:53.41]They're down there playing bongos.
[169:55.29]There's a lot going on.
[169:56.45]That's what I mean earlier when I said there's just stuff going on.
[169:58.89]Let's see.
[170:00.49]I see no one was there.
[170:01.15]Oh.
[170:02.63]I'm going to use this.
[170:03.79]That's spooky, dude.
[170:04.33]Yeah, they're fighting down.
[170:05.51]That's cool.
[170:06.35]There's a background war going on.
[170:12.56]Alright, so for this one, we want to go to each of these trains, right?
[170:16.10]Left and right?
[170:16.86]Yeah.
[170:17.06]And then we open it and we transport the ammunition on it to the... Okay, this is going to get weird.
[170:31.40]I think they're dead.
[170:38.31]What other kind of staffs and stuff are there?
[170:39.83]They're coming from the other side.
[170:40.77]Uh-oh.
[170:42.17]Their face is so itchy.
[170:45.00]Oh, no.

[171:00.64]They're netting us all.
[171:01.96]I can't move.
[171:04.31]Oh, I see him.
[171:04.85]He's like... I'm trying to clear the space.

[171:38.60]Alright, I got this thingy.
[171:39.62]Damn, Copernicus.
[171:41.60]I just see you down there chasing some poor guy down.
[171:44.48]That was the netter, dude.
[171:45.78]Oh, there's a couple more containers down here if we need them.
[171:49.92]Ow!
[171:50.07]Oh, I see.
[171:54.23]We have to take him down here.
[171:55.87]Ow!
[171:56.03]Stop!
[171:57.51]Yeah, so it's like up the platform.
[171:59.73]Like the landing platform.
[172:00.91]I got you.
[172:01.55]So we're gonna get as many as we can over there, right?
[172:04.35]Whatever.
[172:04.85]Just... I gotta...
[172:08.66]They're blocking the stairs.
[172:10.52]That's all of them, right?
[172:12.35]How many do you need?
[172:12.77]Four?
[172:13.01]That's all of them.
[172:14.07]It's just all of them.
[172:16.21]We have a couple here and then we have to get them to that.
[172:20.07]Yeah.
[172:21.11]So the augments are even faster than others.
[172:23.63]I'll pick it up.
[172:24.23]You want to drop one for me?
[172:28.55]I'll take it.
[172:30.93]Ow.
[172:35.30]I got to find a pit to push some people off.
[172:37.20]And this goes up in the middle?
[172:39.29]Why do you keep swinging the dead bodies?
[172:44.99]Because it makes sure they're dead.
[172:49.54]I mean, when you knock them over as an Ogryn, that's when you knock them over.
[172:53.08]Yeah, sometimes you don't know.
[172:59.58]Ooh, the flamer.
[173:08.22]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[173:09.88]Uh-oh.
[173:10.38]You're alright, snot.
[173:11.32]I gotcha.
[173:11.84]I got a live flash before my eyes.
[173:14.97]Jeez.
[173:15.91]What's this?
[173:18.55]Oh.
[173:18.85]You shot the guy in the head.
[173:23.87]That guy threw the grenade and then his head was gone.
[173:26.02]Ow.
[173:37.20]Another swarm coming behind us.
[173:42.26]I think this is ammunition.
[173:43.38]Oh wait, is this the stuff we're supposed to be delivering?
[173:48.05]Yeah.
[173:48.31]He's going to throw a grenade in here.
[173:50.79]Oh shit.
[173:51.11]Get out of there!
[173:52.31]Got him.
[173:53.67]Got one here.

[175:30.70]What's the lore name for it?
[175:33.94]That's a helicopter in the lore.
[175:35.78]Yeah, they just call it that.
[175:38.40]Let's go!
[175:39.04]Alright, I'm gonna bump him.
[175:42.90]Can I do it?
[175:43.48]That didn't work.
[175:44.14]Keep going, man.
[175:45.54]Keep going.
[175:45.94]Alright, we gotta be careful.
[175:48.06]Oh, they hurt.
[175:48.70]They hit hard.
[175:49.52]Get in!
[175:51.14]Get in!
[175:52.08]I've gotta get on 20!
[175:53.28]I can't get on the platform.
[175:56.54]Do I have to jump?
[175:57.45]Okay, there we go.
[175:58.95]No!
[176:04.19]I think we're good.
[176:07.29]Nice.
[176:07.45]I probably got at least 60 or 70 there.
[176:09.97]I'm tired.
[176:10.45]You see me all tuckered out?
[176:11.67]Cool.
[176:14.58]So we're going to be level five?
[176:16.94]Yeah, you'll definitely hit level five.
[176:18.04]I just unlocked a dueling sword.
[176:31.55]Wait, that one's super fun.
[176:33.93]It's like you're basically holding... It's like a pirate.
[176:36.79]You have a little cutlass.
[176:38.33]Oh, really?
[176:38.99]Yeah, it looks so goofy.
[176:40.85]I unlocked traits.
[176:42.81]That's like skill points, right?
[176:44.43]Yeah, so those... Every five levels, you can allocate... You can change them whenever, so you don't have to respec or anything.
[176:50.18]Really?
[176:51.24]Yeah, and they are really good buffs for your class based on how you like to play them.
[176:58.78]Let's take a look.
[177:03.59]Do you guys want another fourth to jump in?
[177:06.09]I'm good either way.
[177:08.94]Yeah, I'm totally down for either.
[177:10.74]I know Strippen's available.
[177:13.66]Jerm, if you want to see, Strippen's got a level 30 Ogryn.
[177:17.36]Really?
[177:19.77]The full power of the eventual Ogryn is.
[177:22.73]Oh my goodness, I just unlocked a new shirt.
[177:25.77]I do want to see that too, so I'll back out and let Strippen join and then we can see what high level stuff looks like.
[177:31.61]Whatever.
[177:32.55]You want to just do one more and then we'll get Strippen in?
[177:36.08]Oh yeah, that's fine if you want to do another one.
[177:38.08]We'll do one more.
[177:40.71]I do kind of want to see what the high-level unlocks look like.
[177:44.47]I only knocked five people off the ledge back there, guys.
[177:48.17]Out of how many?
[177:49.15]70?
[177:49.53]I have to get 20.
[177:50.11]Okay.
[177:50.39]Whoa, what's this?
[177:53.15]I have to pick one of these two.
[177:54.11]I think I just hit four.
[177:55.02]I don't know what that unlocks.
[178:02.28]Wait, I can change my... Can I change this?
[178:06.68]Wait.
[178:06.84]There we go.
[178:10.32]the feed if you just click on it it'll equip the different one oh I thought I could do something up here too oh no those are that's just default those are default I think for now but eventually there's like gonna be other subclasses I think so like I'm a zealot preacher and eventually you could be like a zealot I don't know matic or something so I gotta pick between these three yeah
[178:39.90]I think I'm going to keep my current staff.
[178:41.60]I like it.
[178:42.06]I feel like it's this one.
[178:43.24]I feel like it's this one here.
[178:46.92]Just 100% toughness replenishment.
[178:48.30]That seems just great.
[178:52.25]There's little icons on weapons.
[178:55.29]I don't know what each one means.
[178:58.13]Yeah.
[178:59.02]Oh, inspect.
[179:00.56]Maybe inspect shows what they mean.
[179:01.86]No?
[179:03.11]Oh, it does.
[179:03.47]There we go.
[179:03.79]If you inspect, it shows on the right side what each of those icons mean.
[179:10.50]Did I unlock any other clothes?
[179:14.52]I got just a shirt on my guy, and I look even stupider when I don't have the full little onesie.
[179:20.49]People saying that this is a dad shirt.
[179:24.83]Is that your new shirt, that tank top?
[179:26.51]Yeah, it's just like a dirty tank top.
[179:29.33]I think it looks good.
[179:30.75]I think it's cool.
[179:31.15]Yeah.
[179:33.93]Oh, everybody, let's go check the weapons.
[179:36.79]Because it could be new.
[179:37.49]Actually, hold on.
[179:44.47]Same weapons.
[179:46.53]20 minutes.
[179:57.17]So is the only way for me to get that little sword you were talking about, Criken, is if it just is in the shop, like when it refreshes?
[180:04.58]um yes unless did it say emperor's gift and at the end of the match um I don't really read I don't do that so if you desire you might have it because sometimes at the end of the match you just get a free weapon from damper because he's very generous yeah amazing yeah so I I don't think I'm gonna buy anything let's keep what I have yeah what the
[180:34.32]A family reunion.
[180:50.18]Alright, that was a 3D movie.
[180:52.30]If I had 3D glasses, that'd be crazy.
[180:56.62]Yeah, are you guys good to go?
[180:57.36]Yeah, I'm ready.
[180:59.54]I believe so.
[181:00.65]We could do a lights out one.
[181:03.54]I don't have a flashlight anymore.
[181:04.78]I sold a gun with a flashlight.
[181:07.92]My guy's so ugly.
[181:15.07]Does the barber let you do like full cosmetic change or just hair?
[181:23.94]This haircut just makes me look like a goofball.
[181:30.29]That's like your mom gave you that haircut.
[181:33.06]Have you seen where the barber is?
[181:35.50]Yeah, I had something else before.
[181:37.08]Let's go get you a cut.
[181:37.86]Maybe you can get one similar to mine.
[181:39.96]Yeah, somebody said I have the mow.
[181:41.32]The three stooges cut, yeah.
[181:44.12]No, I'll keep it.
[181:44.97]I'll keep it.
[181:48.87]So what's this one?
[181:50.43]This is the normal one.
[181:51.85]Oh, no lights out.
[182:01.45]Oh, look at that new shirt.
[182:03.87]Okay.
[182:08.43]And there's Snot.
[182:10.15]Hi.
[182:12.41]Hi, folks.
[182:13.59]I wonder if eventually you can get big armor pieces or something.
[182:17.53]Sorry, I didn't do my feats, guys.
[182:18.67]Give me a second.
[182:20.19]You guys a fan of feats?
[182:21.85]You got 35 seconds.
[182:23.89]Oh, brother.
[182:26.09]You better check.
[182:26.67]What is this stuff exactly?
[182:29.71]are these passives or do I have to do something they're passives you just have to select one of the three and it just will be on you permanently oh my god there's too like there's too many words dude I might just pick one at random we said do you dye your hair no I don't this is weirdly enough and this is actually a good thing but you know obviously knock on wood um I don't have any gray hair
[182:55.24]And that's a little concerning because I'm getting a little older.
[182:57.96]I don't have any gray hair.
[183:02.50]I'm not looking forward to when I look in the mirror and there's just white hairs here.
[183:08.05]We'll see.
[183:12.77]Yeah.
[183:13.97]Let's move.
[183:14.79]We look so cool.
[183:16.75]We did just look really cool.
[183:17.72]Just the coolest bunch of dudes you've ever seen.
[183:19.80]It'll be the same kind of layout, but will the mission be the same every time?
[183:22.92]Will it change it up?
[183:25.44]Yeah.
[183:26.62]Usually the things that change are the secondary objectives and whatever other modifiers are on the level.
[183:32.50]But you do end up doing the same mission a lot.
[183:35.04]Yeah.
[183:38.65]So I guess like any of those other modifiers.
[183:40.41]Well, I think after this we can probably try a level three, especially if Sam's joining.
[183:45.67]Well, it's also, I mean, the levels are, they're supposed to be played over and over again.
[183:49.27]That will be very different.
[183:52.53]And I feel like a dark modifier.
[183:53.31]The difficulty spike from two to three is very dramatic.
[183:55.57]Yeah.
[183:56.44]Change a lot of it, yeah.
[183:57.22]Alright.
[184:03.24]No, I'm not going to waste any ammo.
[184:04.92]Not like last time.
[184:16.01]Wait.
[184:16.17]Are we looking for grimoires again in this one?
[184:18.77]I see the mission thing.
[184:20.55]It's just... The last time it appeared, I think, under the main objective.
[184:25.43]No.
[184:26.75]Criken, can I get a lore update on what I'm looking at here?
[184:28.87]Did I miss his... I punched... What?
[184:33.75]Disco ball.
[184:35.19]Whoa.
[184:36.07]Wait a second.
[184:36.65]There's a skull on it.
[184:37.27]This is a sever... something.
[184:41.92]He tried to kill me.
[184:44.22]That was a test.
[184:45.10]He passed.
[184:51.20]Oof.
[184:53.09]Right in the teeth.
[184:57.31]I already have ammo.
[185:06.52]Cool.
[185:12.76]So Criken, do you have any blues?
[185:15.96]Uh, yeah.
[185:16.50]I only have blue right now.
[185:21.10]I have one purple.
[185:23.24]You have a purple?
[185:25.36]Yeah.
[185:26.70]I mean, at the level you're at, you can start getting purples.
[185:30.83]Oh, like purple weapons?
[185:32.29]Yeah.
[185:32.61]I didn't hit.
[185:35.81]Oh my god.
[185:57.05]Bit of Warhammer war.
[186:00.09]Uh... Oh.
[186:01.51]I... What was that sound?
[186:05.61]A net gun.
[186:08.18]Oh, we got him.
[186:08.74]Okay, cool.
[186:10.80]I like just the concept of, like... So the Empire, you know, colonizes thousands and thousands of planets.
[186:19.82]And then some shit goes down, and they basically can't travel for, like, a few thousand years.
[186:26.74]and so these planets these colonies just don't hear back from you know the emperor for thousands of years and then they show up one day and they're like alright time to pay back the back taxes that you owe and everyone's like no that and then they just burn their planet and take it back and they're like no you this is our planet oh the empire exactly sorry I forgot I was streaming I was just like blocking in playing
[186:54.63]This game does that, man.
[186:55.55]I just like to zone out.
[187:03.51]How are you still alive?
[187:25.05]I'm gonna blow!
[187:26.03]I'm gonna blow!
[187:27.31]Get away from me!
[187:31.07]Too much magic.
[187:32.29]Oh, right.
[187:32.79]That's the thing.
[187:33.55]I forgot to pace myself.
[187:40.96]Thanks for the help, fellas.
[187:45.54]I actually need that.
[187:50.04]Oh, sorry.
[187:50.70]You get the next one.
[187:53.65]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[187:55.43]You probably needed it too, though.
[187:57.31]We have to share it.
[187:58.94]I need to find a big ammo case somewhere.
[188:03.12]I think that's like a full ammo refill for everyone.
[188:12.89]Oops, you're a person.
[188:15.37]Did you just shoot me?
[188:16.47]I tried.
[188:17.13]Grenades?
[188:17.49]Anybody need grenades?
[188:19.69]Grenades?
[188:22.84]that's a good question are there any dances in the game not that I've found we could come up with one like this oh yeah oh wait there is actually hold on is there ready look at me
[188:47.54]Wait.
[188:48.62]I did it wrong.
[188:53.51]Oh, it's a slide.
[188:54.53]Can I do that?
[188:56.23]If you run and slide and then spin around.
[188:58.09]Looks freaking sick.
[188:59.92]Yeah.
[189:02.87]Cool.
[189:03.89]That was pretty cool.
[189:05.21]Oh, he actually calls out who has the lowest ammo, I guess.
[189:08.53]Yeah.
[189:08.87]That's cool.
[189:09.72]If you actually look next to all of our names, there's a little ammunition sign.
[189:14.82]Based on the color of it is how much ammunition.
[189:16.88]Oh.
[189:17.66]It's like the game automatically called out big man for ammo.
[189:23.48]Dog just did a front flip.
[189:25.97]Alright.
[189:27.17]Don't waste ammo.
[189:27.89]Stop it.
[189:29.43]I just love shooting the grenade.
[189:31.15]Wait.
[189:31.31]Can I heal on that thing?
[189:33.10]I don't know if there's any left.
[189:39.09]I'll get it.
[189:48.76]What the hell was that?
[189:49.66]I got shot.
[189:50.98]He just got his head shot almost all the way off.
[189:54.81]He shot me through the wall.
[189:56.01]That was so... That was sad.
[189:57.66]Prykin?
[189:57.98]One sec, guys.
[189:58.62]I'm gonna take care of him.
[190:00.52]Prykin?
[190:01.46]What?
[190:02.30]You alright?
[190:03.44]Yeah.
[190:05.48]Okay, alright.
[190:06.46]That was a big... Oh, wow!
[190:07.82]It hit me, too!
[190:08.54]Be careful, guys.
[190:10.01]Keep your head down.
[190:10.49]I'll shoot him if I can find him, but... Oh, there he is.
[190:13.43]Got him.
[190:14.43]Nice.
[190:14.77]These guys are jerks.
[190:17.73]Those guys... I managed it on hard and harder, whatever.
[190:20.53]Those things probably kill you in one hit.
[190:22.52]Mm-hmm.
[190:23.20]Mm-hmm.
[190:23.66]That's probably sad.
[190:24.46]Let's go.
[190:25.65]Crank it.
[190:26.09]I think the witches only come out during the night.
[190:36.65]Yeah, you guys had like four of them on that night mission.
[190:39.56]Oh, yeah.
[190:42.80]Maybe modifiers in general make more of the hard enemy spawn.
[190:46.64]Oh, I'll hack it.
[190:57.07]Oh boy No, come here, please thank you for killing that guy cuz I couldn't I
[191:31.89]Yeah, I definitely should not do that.
[191:33.50]It's way too slow.
[191:34.86]What are you doing?
[191:38.14]The hacking.
[191:38.54]There's a little mini game in this fight that you have to do.
[191:42.58]I bet Snot would be pretty good at it.
[191:44.96]Yeah, you should get it.
[191:46.06]Does that actually affect the speed of the little bar?
[191:50.25]The Ogryn does, yeah.
[191:51.17]It's just slower in general.
[191:54.55]Guys, I'm not going to lie.
[191:57.73]I tried to do it, but I didn't know how to do it.
[192:00.80]Alright, I'm guarding you, Snot.
[192:01.76]Go for it.
[192:02.64]Big guy.
[192:03.26]Big guy.
[192:04.34]Oh yeah, we've got just a typical hack here.
[192:06.92]One second, folks.
[192:07.36]Let me take care of this.
[192:12.96]Yeah, it looks like the motherboard might be fried on this one, guys.
[192:16.49]What's wrong with it?
[192:17.83]Uh-oh.
[192:20.03]Yeah, it just needs some more.
[192:21.23]There we go.
[192:21.99]Need a little tweaking.
[192:23.25]I got it, guys.
[192:23.81]It's one of those 4090s with the high voltage pin, right?
[192:26.69]It catches on fire.
[192:28.01]Yeah, exactly that.
[192:29.83]Nailed it.
[192:31.95]isn't the 4090 like as big as uh like five bricks laid on top of each other basically yeah as much power as a typical household that's what they use to wipe the cold winters to warm the winters in this universe 4090s yeah
[193:00.19]That's Mr. Krabs!
[193:11.86]Right into the fire.
[193:16.87]Snot, more hack and go for you if you want.
[193:19.69]Alright, let's see what I can do.
[193:20.89]This game is fun as fuck.
[193:32.28]Yeah, I like this.
[193:33.58]Especially what you said after getting a weapon that's more your playstyle.
[193:37.46]Yeah.
[193:39.48]That changes so much.
[193:41.96]Getting this axe versus the shovel, I'm actually killing people with melee now, which is nice.
[193:48.29]Oh, Smaat needs some Gatorade.
[193:49.73]I'm getting hurt.
[193:52.52]my electrolytes are all screwed up Mr. Krabs is my favorite warhammer character there are actually the slaneshi demons all have like crab claws and tentacles and do they yeah guys throwing a grenade is he still alive
[194:17.21]Oops.
[194:19.57]Oops.
[194:20.41]Don't help him.
[194:21.07]Let him think about what he's done.
[194:22.39]Yeah, he's got to learn the hard way.
[194:25.07]I start pinching his fingers.
[194:26.83]Yeah, just start stepping on my fingers.
[194:38.63]How many grenades?
[194:39.57]I need to chill with these grenades.
[194:40.93]Yeah, it's been like three.
[194:42.84]Oh, fuck me!
[194:44.80]I thought it was only when the power was out.
[194:46.21]I thought it was when the power was out.
[194:48.25]I'm going to brick him.
[194:49.21]I'm going to brick him.
[194:50.93]This is bad, guys.
[195:01.92]This is very bad, I would say.
[195:03.98]Oh, Snot's down too.
[195:06.26]I put down healing.
[195:11.14]What?
[195:11.42]No, he's choking you.
[195:12.62]Yeah.
[195:13.72]I don't know if we can kill him in time.
[195:14.96]Where's the healing?
[195:19.07]No more shouty.
[195:22.79]Where'd he go?
[195:23.77]He's gone.
[195:24.45]It's like the witch, I guess.
[195:25.41]Oh, he just kills the one that disturbs him?
[195:27.21]Yeah, other than that dark mission, I guess, where you have to kill it.
[195:31.67]Wait, I disturbed him?
[195:33.71]No, I did, buddy.
[195:35.05]Oh, we lost two.
[195:36.05]He's dead too?
[195:36.99]He died separately.
[195:39.65]He died unrelated causes.
[195:41.11]We have to rescue.
[195:41.92]Ow, that fucking hurts.
[195:48.56]I'm gonna pass you a note.
[195:49.24]Alright, we're good?
[195:49.80]Where are they?
[195:50.46]Down here?
[195:51.14]Oh my goodness.
[195:52.58]Alright.
[195:52.94]Glad you were close.
[196:22.23]Does anyone need ammo right now?
[196:24.93]I do.
[196:26.17]But if you need it more than me, I can use the knife.
[196:28.35]I have an ammo box so I can deploy it.
[196:31.59]Oh, cool.
[196:32.25]Yeah, I definitely need it then.
[196:33.80]Let's find a good spot where we can all get some.
[196:35.90]Right here.
[196:37.42]Oh, wait.
[196:38.84]Did I?
[196:39.76]I thought I did.
[196:40.32]Maybe I guess that wasn't what I thought it was.
[196:42.26]Is it healing?
[196:43.38]No, I guess it was just like a big bag of ammo.
[196:53.87]Yeah, still not familiar with what all the pickups look like.
[196:56.13]Like that.
[196:56.59]What is that?
[196:57.73]That's just a full ammo.
[196:59.10]Oh, okay.
[197:01.26]What's happening?
[197:02.36]Giant raid?
[197:03.28]Is it a raid?
[197:04.18]Who raided?
[197:04.54]What happened?
[197:06.84]Big raid?
[197:11.59]Huge raid.
[197:12.35]Alright.
[197:13.53]Who was it?
[197:14.73]Somebody said there was like 40,000 people.
[197:16.93]Are you serious?
[197:17.45]Who did it?
[197:18.65]Thank you.
[197:18.97]Whoever it was.
[197:23.14]Who raided me with 40,000 people?
[197:29.36]Oh, you're just full of shit.
[197:30.52]This was where I saw the book last time, but I don't think we have that mission, right?
[197:33.60]No, we don't have any.
[197:35.04]It's all left.
[197:35.86]Get him.
[197:50.72]There's a medic thing here.
[197:56.01]I can do that too.
[197:57.69]I missed.
[197:58.67]Oh my god, that fucking hurts so bad.
[198:03.45]So is there a sound right before they fire?
[198:06.37]I'm not dodging them.
[198:07.15]I really need to dodge them.
[198:08.23]I need to remember the dodge even exists.
[198:11.28]I love the dodge.
[198:12.50]There's another one over there somewhere.
[198:14.06]Excuse me?
[198:14.66]Who is shooting me?
[198:15.78]There's another sniper.
[198:17.34]I think you got him.
[198:27.65]Never mind.
[198:28.37]I thought there was an outside area.
[198:29.75]There's just this giant lit up area.
[198:32.47]Sanctuary.
[198:34.64]okay we do have an ammo box I think we need it right yeah you missed them all they were here it'd be kind of sad I want to push these guys off one sec watch this oh sorry dog doggy uh where is it where are they position audio is actually pretty good in this game yeah oh my god why can't we kill this dog he's fast
[199:00.49]Are you trying to get them pushed off?
[199:01.93]Oh, you're trying to do the shove.
[199:03.81]Alright.
[199:06.47]Dart, that would be so sad if 40,000 people raided and the view count did not go up by one viewer.
[199:14.64]They all left immediately.
[199:16.94]That would be very sad, actually.
[199:23.20]Dude, 40,000 people raid.
[199:24.40]Oh, raid, here it comes.
[199:26.34]My view count goes down.
[199:28.18]That would be sad.
[199:31.36]That was a really bad idea, and I'm muted in the comms right now, so they're probably like, what is he doing?
[199:43.35]I'm stuck.
[199:53.35]Okay, I got unmuted.
[199:56.35]Sorry, I was muted.
[200:00.60]Oh no, they left too.
[200:06.48]Hello?
[200:08.70]Oh, that was weird.
[200:09.52]Oh wait, did it sound like we left?
[200:12.53]That was very funny because everyone just said that a raid of 40,000 people came in.
[200:18.47]And they, I mean, the chat was just full of shit.
[200:20.41]They were just like, oh, huge raid, like 50,000 people.
[200:22.79]I'm like, who the fuck is doing that?
[200:24.02]Who's live right now?
[200:25.96]And then you guys weren't like, they were like, oh, they all left.
[200:28.92]And then I'm like, that was bullshit.
[200:30.66]I come back here and you guys aren't here.
[200:33.52]So it was like weird.
[200:34.32]You kept it going for like an hour.
[200:35.86]Yeah.
[200:36.20]You looked over and you were streaming just to a party of zero.
[200:39.70]And you've just been alone this whole time.
[200:42.25]That would be terrifying.
[200:43.09]Do you guys have stress dreams about streaming?
[200:47.45]Yep.
[200:47.55]Of course.
[200:49.69]The classic.
[200:51.25]I'm live while I'm lying in bed and I didn't need to be entertaining.
[200:54.83]You want to go around?
[200:55.89]Let's go around the table here.
[200:57.93]What's your nightmare stream dream?
[201:02.03]I was actually, the other day, I was thinking about how lucky I was because I have stressed dreams about school stuff.
[201:08.98]Like I'm trying to find my class.
[201:11.28]But I was like, you know what?
[201:12.28]I was telling my chat, I don't have stressed dreams about streaming.
[201:16.14]I feel like I should have by now.
[201:18.30]And then that night, I had a dream that my camera was on.
[201:22.60]I like was basically face-revealing on accident, but I was trying to cover my like I was trying to cover my face I couldn't move in front of the camera.
[201:30.85]So I was just covering up my different facial features, but I only oh Really?
[201:36.25]Yeah, it was like I was covering like only my mouth.
[201:38.48]Oh my god.
[201:39.20]They can still see my eyes It's like a thousand people just spawned What the hell?
[201:47.70]Now I've opened the door, though.
[201:49.36]I'm going to start having stress dreams about streaming.
[201:52.42]Whoa!
[201:53.52]Get off him!
[201:54.70]Dude, I keep having the same stream, nightmare stress dream.
[201:57.79]Oh, really?
[201:58.39]Yeah, and it's happened like at least four times.
[202:00.85]I keep having it.
[202:02.35]So I'm naked from the waist down with a webcam on.
[202:07.77]And I stand up and I realize, oh shit, I'm naked.
[202:11.26]People can probably see my, you know, you know.
[202:14.02]And I freak out and nobody in the chat says anything.
[202:18.56]And then I go, fuck.
[202:20.06]Well, no, it's just like, cause I'm like, did I show my, did I, did that just happen?
[202:23.76]Cause I'm naked right now.
[202:25.32]And like, I stand up a little too far and I'm like, wait a minute.
[202:27.63]Is that what that was out on in frame in my webcam view.
[202:31.37]And then I don't, and one or two people in the chat will say, oh my God, did anybody see that?
[202:35.65]And I'm like, fuck.
[202:37.37]And I go back and look at the VOD, and I go wicked slow frame by frame, and I see that I just barely get it in frame.
[202:44.93]You just barely get your dick in frame?
[202:47.43]Well, hey, come on.
[202:48.38]This is a sponsored stream, man.
[202:49.72]Oh, sorry.
[202:51.10]We can't say that.
[202:54.02]Anyways, the Warhammer lore.
[202:55.60]What can we go over that again?
[202:57.42]I've been having a lot of dreams about Warhammer.
[202:59.93]Yeah, dude, I've had so many dreams about Warhammer.
[203:02.67]Especially the...
[203:05.06]The unbelievable... Imagine my ass came down in Warhammer.
[203:07.86]I wonder, does streaming exist on Hyper Worlds?
[203:16.34]Yeah, there's a streamer.
[203:17.67]I don't know.
[203:19.93]Imagine the freaking impressions.
[203:21.59]What is entertainment like in the 40K universe?
[203:23.93]You don't really get that.
[203:27.17]Yeah, true, I guess.
[203:28.47]You're just going to have a bad time and you die.
[203:30.69]Too grimdark for fun.
[203:34.10]Who's naked in Warhammer?
[203:36.49]I took both the crafting materials.
[203:37.69]Fight me for them.
[203:40.13]Well, they're shared, so thanks.
[203:42.31]Oh.
[203:42.67]Uh, I'm gonna hold on to it.
[203:45.22]Um...
[203:51.31]So I talk in my sleep sometimes, and I've been told that when I've had a streaming stress stream, I'll just randomly talk like I'm on stream, like there's a certain cadence to your voice when you're on stream, you know?
[204:05.44]And I'll just be rolling around, and then I'll just be like,
[204:08.07]Like, hey, what's going on?
[204:11.25]Really?
[204:12.09]In the darkness of my room.
[204:15.07]You do like the YouTuber voice in a sleep talk?
[204:19.01]Just while under the covers in the dark.
[204:22.46]Because I'm convinced that I'm on stream.
[204:24.58]I need to say something entertaining.
[204:26.98]It's really horrible.
[204:29.52]That's so scary.
[204:31.92]That's so stress-inducing.
[204:33.89]Yeah, there's going to be so many studies on us, I'm sure, years from now, of what this has done to our collective brains.
[204:40.59]How did a dog get in here?
[204:43.53]I'm not a big sleep talker, but I did wake myself up with a fart the other night.
[204:48.24]Oh my god.
[204:50.46]And it was really embarrassing.
[204:53.20]I feel like my farts aren't loud enough to do that.
[204:55.56]Oh, you're a weak farter?
[205:00.38]I mean, it's just like this, it's just... I can't get this guy off.
[205:05.50]Deficiencies in your diet, I think.
[205:12.09]This guy won't leave me alone.
[205:14.25]Leave me the fuck alone!
[205:17.41]Okay.
[205:24.00]You guys want to come up here and get the... Yeah, we're just getting tackled down here.
[205:28.68]I'm getting hurt.
[205:29.24]Okay.
[205:30.58]Here, I'll help.
[205:31.62]I'm going to deploy some ammo up top here, dude.
[205:36.22]Oh, this part was actually kind of tricky.
[205:37.46]Alright, we got ammo up here if you need it.
[205:40.93]Oh, shit.
[205:41.41]I'm in trouble, actually.
[205:44.75]Oh, a button.
[205:45.61]You can deploy a health pack up here, maybe.
[205:48.83]I'm covering you.
[205:49.71]Alright, cool.
[205:57.38]The game looks kind of easy.
[205:59.48]Well, we are not playing on any hard difficulty right now.
[206:04.78]This is the second one, but yeah.
[206:07.55]After this mission, we're going to bump it up to a level, I think.
[206:11.89]Yeah, where is it?
[206:14.05]I see him.
[206:16.79]Oh, nice shot.
[206:18.67]And that was not an E3 presentation.
[206:20.29]I really mean it.
[206:27.24]The net gun, uh, trapper or whatever.
[206:30.50]Oh, bomber, actually.
[206:31.14]Is that guy alive?
[206:36.80]Alright, I'm gonna take it.
[206:39.80]You idiot.
[206:40.04]You can probably throw them from up here.
[206:42.14]If you want to come upstairs here, you might... Uh, actually, never mind.
[206:44.58]No, don't throw it over there.
[206:45.54]I can move pretty quickly with it, right?
[206:46.70]That's one of my perks.
[206:47.46]Yeah, yeah.
[206:48.24]Do we have any more inside this train?
[206:50.12]No, I guess that's all.
[206:51.18]Okay.
[206:52.84]So, uh...
[206:55.25]Oh, you're a priest.
[206:55.77]Okay.
[206:56.33]I don't know.
[206:57.81]I don't know.
[206:59.81]I was looking at chat and then I heard a drop.
[207:02.03]He was just carrying the thing correctly.
[207:04.55]It drops it, turns around, winds up a big knife attack on my neck.
[207:09.80]I was startled.
[207:11.26]Oh, shit.
[207:11.64]It's not over now.
[207:14.70]You guys are in trouble.
[207:15.36]Alright.
[207:29.59]Nice, good charge.
[207:30.75]Alright, we're good.
[207:36.82]Alright, that's all of them from this area.
[207:41.98]You're alive.
[207:43.58]Right on.
[207:43.92]I was gonna say, that's why I always check people when they're down.
[207:51.72]I'm getting the rest of my push kills after this.
[207:57.02]Look at this guy's tummy.
[207:59.34]Anyone want to look at a tummy?
[208:00.70]I would love to.
[208:02.08]Look.
[208:04.09]What the hell is wrong with you?
[208:05.63]This is grody.
[208:06.59]That's gross.
[208:07.87]Look at his tummy.
[208:11.55]Large enemy incoming wave.
[208:14.31]You know what?
[208:22.48]I'll say it.
[208:23.42]Screw these guys.
[208:25.20]Whoa.
[208:25.78]No, I agree.
[208:27.06]I hate all heresy in all forms.
[208:30.47]I think my guy got arrested for heresy, but it was, like, a little bit real.
[208:34.01]Just light heresy?
[208:35.11]Yeah, light heresy.
[208:35.77]Just a little bit of light.
[208:36.47]No such thing.
[208:37.01]Arrest him.
[208:38.15]Again.
[208:41.47]Turn him into curtains.
[208:47.25]Turn him into a Nintendo 64.
[208:49.57]I want to have tons of fun playing Mario.
[208:53.14]Who determines what they get turned into?
[208:55.08]Yeah.
[208:55.26]That would be the most fun job.
[208:57.40]Just coming up with shit.
[208:58.76]This guy strikes me as a curtain rod.
[209:00.98]Let's make him a curtain rod.
[209:05.12]Okay, here we go.
[209:06.84]Last one.
[209:07.30]You guys are torn on that one.
[209:13.00]They should do like an online quiz, like personality quiz for which type of servitor you become.
[209:17.28]Yes, dude.
[209:19.28]That's the stuff people need.
[209:20.42]I think we're almost done, right?
[209:23.16]I'm trying to get him, guys.
[209:32.42]What the heck?
[209:33.64]What the heck?
[209:37.12]I can't believe I didn't hit him.
[209:38.52]I'll go get him.
[209:39.06]I'm putting the last one in.
[209:43.61]Watch out.
[209:43.91]That sniper might still be up there.
[209:45.39]I got him.
[209:45.71]I got him.
[209:45.97]Alright.
[209:46.21]We're good.
[209:47.23]Everybody make it to the extraction.
[209:48.47]There's a gunner up here.
[209:51.57]You're right.
[209:55.20]Do you need to shove people again?
[209:57.94]I'll try a little bit, but... What do we think the worst servitor options are?
[210:01.69]Worst servitor options?
[210:03.55]Maybe a bidet.
[210:04.53]Bidet servitor.
[210:05.11]Yeah, dude.
[210:05.37]I'm telling you.
[210:05.91]Toilet servitor would be awful.
[210:07.75]Just going... Like blowing the fucking... Listen, I think the point was clear.
[210:13.73]I don't think you needed to make a fart noise.
[210:15.70]Oh, guys.
[210:17.22]You're going to have to go on without me.
[210:19.60]I got you.
[210:19.90]This is bad news.
[210:20.42]I got you.
[210:20.80]I got you.
[210:21.10]I got you.
[210:21.34]I got you.
[210:22.32]I got netted.
[210:23.94]Got you.
[210:24.77]Oh, now we're split up.
[210:25.53]Watch out, there's fire.
[210:26.27]Oh wait, is that our fire?
[210:27.41]Goodbye.
[210:28.55]We are out of here, soldiers.
[210:32.71]Nice.
[210:37.69]Someone said, imagine having to call the tech priest to fix your toilet.
[210:42.41]I don't know anything about Warhammer lore, but isn't there a dude who just... who deals with all the servitors?
[210:48.56]Yeah, the mechanics are basically priests in this, so they just pray.
[210:51.96]Pray to fix it, yeah.
[210:52.90]Pray to fix it.
[210:55.03]What a weird job.
[210:59.17]Ooh, I got a faux rend MKV ripper gun.
[211:02.60]Sword class unlocked.
[211:03.86]You know, some might consider we have a weird job, so we can't really be judging.
[211:12.72]It's true.
[211:13.39]I got 10,000 almost.
[211:15.99]Oh, no, that's just current.
[211:16.83]That's not currency.
[211:17.47]Okay, never mind.
[211:21.30]you guys feel you want to do another one hell yeah yeah he said he's around yeah what's this dragon alright I that was fun though thank you yeah no thanks for joining josh that's VRJosh mod I'm just gonna go back to uh banning and timing out a lot of you weirdos
[211:47.13]I look over and she's like, message deleted, message deleted, ban, ban, ban.
[211:49.35]Like he's just back in it.
[211:50.69]He's back in it, back in the chair.
[211:52.29]I love how I'm getting defaced for that.
[211:59.43]You guys called me a weirdo 20 minutes ago.
[212:02.09]It's not fair.
[212:04.81]They can dish it, but they can't take it.
[212:06.41]I know, it's not fair.
[212:08.51]That's really the chat experience in a nutshell, isn't it?
[212:12.30]They can dish, but they can't take.
[212:15.46]It's different, because ours is true.
[212:17.67]Eh, well... You should start training them to, like... Like, take abuse better.
[212:25.73]Just have, like, streams dedicated to... Just getting them used to getting roasted a little.
[212:33.37]We all have the same clothes.
[212:37.78]I'm going to the barber.
[212:38.66]Okay, I'm going to make a different haircut or something.
[212:42.82]I think you can rock it if you have confidence.
[212:46.25]Maybe a different beard.
[212:47.69]Where's the barber?
[212:48.25]It's over here somewhere.
[212:49.49]I just think I crashed my game.
[212:51.69]I think I exited this menu too quick.
[212:57.61]Where's the barber?
[213:00.15]He's on the left side if you're looking at the green Disney World thing.
[213:05.28]Does this cost money or no?
[213:07.16]Barber's free.
[213:26.43]Oh, man.
[213:28.35]I think this is pretty good, actually.
[213:30.05]I think that's that I love it.
[213:38.04]Do they have many Mohawk options?
[213:40.26]They don't actually, I think they might.
[213:53.83]I like this so far.
[214:04.04]Criken, can you invite me again on this site?
[214:06.28]This one actually I think is it.
[214:13.03]It's that one.
[214:34.54]I've made my decision.
[214:43.39]You said your guy is good?
[214:45.03]I think so.
[214:45.51]I'm just doing some scars.
[214:48.29]Yeah.
[214:49.33]I thought about adding some scars, but... Am I in your game?
[214:59.04]I think you just joined it.
[215:02.42]Let me tell you what, maybe I can find some cool, maybe I can get a new mustache.
[215:05.78]I was gonna have no tattoos.
[215:15.44]It's not as too iconic, actually.
[215:16.74]I don't think I could change them.
[215:19.24]Oh, wait, because I have, I can make my eye color different because of the homeworld I'm from.
[215:24.80]Oh, you're from Cadia, huh?
[215:28.72]Oh, okay.
[215:30.57]Where are you at?
[215:31.09]Let me see your new hair.
[215:32.84]Everyone loves Cadia.
[215:36.70]You'll be back.
[215:38.30]They always are.
[215:40.97]Criken, how do you get the little gems, the little gemstones to level up your weapons?
[215:45.45]Specifically the ones that are like blue font.
[215:49.23]They look like a little cube.
[215:51.86]Those are just rare, the rare ones, but you can find them out in the world.
[215:56.62]Cadia?
[215:57.30]Yeah.
[216:04.62]Ooh, I got blues now.
[216:06.52]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[216:07.54]This is important.
[216:11.21]You got blue eyes?
[216:13.07]I got blue weapons available.
[216:15.37]Goodbye.
[216:15.65]Goodbye.
[216:17.39]This thing's just better.
[216:22.61]Oh, yeah, me too.
[216:23.29]I've got a little blue sword.
[216:25.19]Is this worth eight?
[216:26.45]Like, all my money?
[216:27.10]This is almost every cent that I have.
[216:33.97]That's the vicious cycle of this game.
[216:36.05]Hey.
[216:37.78]Hey.
[216:38.02]Hello.
[216:40.18]Hello.
[216:40.34]I'm doing it.
[216:41.08]That's my buddy Strippin.
[216:43.82]He plays this game even more than me and has the Gigachad Ogryn.
[216:50.78]I want to see.
[216:51.28]So bad.
[216:53.74]Do you know the lore, Strippin?
[216:56.20]I do know lore.
[216:59.01]Alright.
[217:00.61]That's all that matters.
[217:01.33]That's it.
[217:01.53]That was the test.
[217:02.25]Cool, man.
[217:03.25]I want to see... I'm also playing Ogryn and I love Ogryn and I've heard that you have a really cool Ogryn.
[217:11.57]I'm very excited.
[217:12.21]He could be cooler.
[217:13.01]I've been trying to get this achievement done for some really cool armor, but it is just too hard in the dark, I think.
[217:22.17]But the new stuff is awesome that they added today.
[217:26.20]Yeah, the power station.
[217:28.28]The witch encounter freaked me the fuck out when I first saw it.
[217:34.05]I've only managed to kill it once, dude.
[217:35.83]Yeah, especially in harder difficulties.
[217:38.31]I cannot imagine how hard it gets.
[217:41.11]Are we going to do the hard difficulties that we're about to do?
[217:44.19]I think we should do a three, yeah.
[217:45.17]We could totally do a three, yeah.
[217:48.25]I've escorted these guys to the boss room.
[217:49.93]I'm going to pretend I've DC'd.
[217:51.43]Good luck.
[217:53.89]Little small children.
[217:55.05]They're so dead.
[217:56.47]And let's go.
[218:00.18]Surely it's going to go well.
[218:02.42]Hey, I think we're going to be fine.
[218:04.26]I got my new weapon.
[218:09.79]Where are you at, Jerma?
[218:10.89]What kind of weapons are you rocking?
[218:13.67]I got... I'm into the gauntlet.
[218:17.11]The Grenader gauntlet.
[218:19.15]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[218:19.80]With the special explosive punch thing.
[218:22.16]Yep.
[218:22.84]That's pretty sweet.
[218:24.70]I just got this new knife.
[218:25.96]Which is pretty cool.
[218:28.02]I'm just standing in front of the mission thing.
[218:29.30]If you want to come look at me.
[218:31.90]I'm just in front of the mission thing.
[218:36.46]The big green... I like the fresh cut, dude.
[218:42.86]You're rocking it.
[218:43.30]You think it's good?
[218:44.40]Yeah.
[218:46.76]I think it looks pretty good.
[218:53.47]I would definitely uncheck the box, show helm, if I had this kind of a hairstyle.
[218:58.87]Yeah, I'm not wearing no helm.
[219:02.56]Wait, where at?
[219:04.34]In front of the missions?
[219:07.77]We don't do a lights out tier 3.
[219:10.35]That might be a little rough.
[219:11.53]That might be scary.
[219:12.77]That would be great.
[219:13.53]Come on.
[219:15.25]We don't have many flashlights we found.
[219:16.81]Wait, what level are these two?
[219:20.45]We got... Is it 6 or 7?
[219:22.35]I'm like a 20 on my main, so... Yeah, it's not 6.
[219:23.97]Okay.
[219:37.00]Yeah.
[219:37.66]Nice posture.
[219:39.85]Okay.
[219:40.17]We could do a three with no modifiers or we could try and do like a light.
[219:44.37]I think it lights out too.
[219:45.25]You get extra XP if you do lights out.
[219:47.25]That's why it's good.
[219:49.41]I think they haven't done a three before.
[219:50.87]We should try that.
[219:51.75]Yeah.
[219:51.93]Let's do a three in daylight if we can.
[219:53.83]Yeah.
[219:54.39]It's a little intimidating because we're very new.
[219:58.84]You guys will do fine.
[220:00.42]Okay.
[220:03.26]Alright.
[220:04.10]I've been struggling.
[220:05.52]I will say.
[220:07.49]You got your new staff.
[220:09.11]Yeah, I got the staff and the new knife.
[220:14.21]And I've gotten a lot of confidence since the first missions.
[220:17.33]Look at that shield.
[220:18.07]Where'd you get that shield?
[220:20.27]Soon you will have a shield of your own.
[220:22.67]Oh, damn, Smush.
[220:24.85]Looking good.
[220:25.65]Yeah, I cleaned up a little.
[220:28.55]I just took the clippers and just went like this a few times.
[220:32.31]Aged a bit as well.
[220:34.17]Grew up about 25 years.
[220:37.35]You guys like my sword?
[220:39.31]That last previous mission was that bad, huh?
[220:40.99]That you aged significantly.
[220:44.73]We've been... Oh, look at these two lads.
[220:47.05]Oh my god.
[220:47.81]I feel like we're pissed to be in the same room together here.
[220:52.33]I want to see a full Ogryn team in this hell of a thing.
[220:55.48]It just crashes in the low.
[220:56.70]It doesn't even make it to the mission.
[220:59.92]I've been in a Fulogren team and it was a hot mess.
[221:02.30]Now it's the boys.
[221:04.02]Yeah, we're gonna do it with the boys here.
[221:06.34]Do you have to be balanced like an Overwatch team?
[221:10.41]It helps.
[221:11.05]It helps, but you don't have to.
[221:12.51]For example, we need someone that can kind of take out snipers.
[221:16.87]I don't really see it in this group.
[221:19.41]Oh, I'll handle that.
[221:21.36]Okay.
[221:21.94]Wait, I brought a flamer.
[221:23.68]Oops.
[221:24.60]I don't have anything to deal with them either.
[221:26.66]Jeremy, if you want to take a look at my gun.
[221:28.00]Yeah, what do you got?
[221:28.80]I like this one.
[221:31.42]What is that?
[221:32.14]Oh my goodness.
[221:33.36]Wow.
[221:33.66]That I was gonna say.
[221:34.94]I got a cool grenade launcher on my arm.
[221:50.28]Actually, oh those are our friends This new map is also really cool It's pretty So this is this is on hard this is on yeah three out of five I
[222:10.03]So what's after hard?
[222:11.90]Is it just four and five?
[222:14.58]Four and five.
[222:16.04]No one within the dev team has beaten five.
[222:22.61]Really?
[222:22.89]Oh my goodness.
[222:23.63]I don't know if any players have beaten five, but five is just insane.
[222:28.67]Okay.
[222:29.23]Well, we're on a three.
[222:40.08]If you get threes down, this is like the juicy EXP.
[222:42.02]I feel like I should be hanging out with snot.
[222:45.20]This shit is bussin'.
[222:46.10]Alright, cool.
[222:48.72]Yeah, you know what?
[222:49.32]This is pretty bussin'.
[222:50.48]I don't know what's going on with snob.
[222:52.65]I kind of want to kiss him.
[222:54.83]Yeah, I'm kind of known as the cutest one in the group.
[222:57.59]He has a kissable face.
[222:59.01]Are these enemies or?
[223:01.61]Yeah, it's the same thing.
[223:06.62]We can try to make friends with them.
[223:08.44]I'm sure they listen for a reason.
[223:13.66]I knew you weren't dead.
[223:14.60]That's why I always check.
[223:18.06]On this ability we get more specials in general.
[223:20.54]These guys are outrageous.
[223:26.58]Are these the bad guys?
[223:32.24]Yep.
[223:39.93]This is my time.
[223:41.43]This is going to be perfect.
[223:42.43]I can't wait to watch this.
[223:51.18]I'm not used to seeing another big dude.
[223:53.88]Yeah, it's actually... I like it.
[223:55.26]Do you feel safer?
[223:58.56]Does that make you feel safer?
[223:59.64]I actually kind of do.
[224:00.56]I do feel safer.
[224:01.54]Should we wait until he throws down that shield?
[224:04.49]Oh, sniper.
[224:07.59]I'll get... Guys, I'll take care of this.
[224:09.05]Oh.
[224:15.93]Oh, there's a look at, oh my god, there's a lot of people here.
[224:18.03]Oh, guys, I'm going to blow up.
[224:22.06]I'm sorry.
[224:24.92]Every time I play with a Psyker, I hear that exact quote and it's like, they already know it's too late.
[224:28.86]Oh my goodness.
[224:30.30]Oh, shit.
[224:30.70]I got dog on me.
[224:34.01]Oh, this is no joke.
[224:37.83]Level three.
[224:40.09]Yeah, there's a big difficulty spike.
[224:41.73]From two to three.
[224:44.21]What's that flame on?
[224:47.09]I didn't kill that guy?
[224:50.37]Alright, we're okay.
[225:00.49]On level 4, you need at least one Ogryn to even survive.
[225:03.35]Really?
[225:04.54]Do you guys agree with that?
[225:12.28]I made a mistake.
[225:12.88]Do you know what the special ability of the ogre is?
[225:16.56]Oh, sorry.
[225:17.92]I didn't see.
[225:19.06]I'm going to tank this.
[225:19.84]Oh, no.
[225:20.32]He's on me.
[225:20.64]He's on me.
[225:21.24]I'm going to die.
[225:21.74]Maybe he'll be okay.
[225:22.64]Let's pick him up.
[225:23.88]No, he's dead.
[225:33.06]Okay, we need him to focus me.
[225:35.56]Guys, I'm gonna blow up again.
[225:36.56]Alright, I pushed myself too hard.
[225:44.07]He's killing himself.
[225:45.29]Alright, yo, that's fine.
[225:47.03]That's fine.
[225:48.87]Shit.
[225:50.17]Oh, my nerves.
[225:53.76]So he leaves after two, right?
[225:55.78]Yep.
[225:59.44]That was incredible.
[226:01.06]Snot just gave himself as a fucking sacrifice.
[226:04.72]Yeah, it was all a strategy.
[226:05.74]Wait, what just happened?
[226:07.62]So, Snot blew up because of his own mechanic.
[226:10.08]Like, he overheated.
[226:11.52]Yeah, I can't have too many spells because I'll... Oh, God.
[226:15.25]I'm stuck between two Ogryn.
[226:16.51]Okay, okay.
[226:18.45]That's alright.
[226:18.93]Things are fine.
[226:19.39]I'm going to throw a grenade.
[226:20.27]It didn't work.
[226:24.99]I'll throw another grenade.
[226:29.75]This is a mess.
[226:32.17]Yeah.
[226:34.15]Alright, Ogre down.
[226:38.65]It's alright, I got us some more experience.
[226:40.17]I got us more XP for that.
[226:42.83]Yeah, we get further kill.
[226:47.99]Oh boy.
[226:48.27]I love that shield.
[226:50.34]There's two healing things.
[226:51.18]Alright, you ready?
[226:54.06]I'm ready.
[226:59.59]Look at the guy running.
[227:05.01]He was not really running to get away.
[227:06.87]That was very funny.
[227:07.77]Yeah, I think certain weapons actually causes fear and they just flee.
[227:14.95]Like if you have a really explosive weapon or something.
[227:17.79]You're right.
[227:18.07]That gun is amazing.
[227:18.87]Is that purple or blue or what is it?
[227:21.64]This one's a purple, but you'll get this pretty soon, I think.
[227:25.36]Well, it seems that's what they're going to say.
[227:27.60]I think you're about level 12.
[227:29.34]Looks cool.
[227:32.68]That was very funny.
[227:41.51]Wait, that's me!
[227:43.45]That's you, bud.
[227:43.95]There you go.
[227:44.39]Oh my god, thank you.
[227:45.21]Nice.
[227:45.39]Nice job.
[228:00.97]Yeah, this difficulty feels so much more intense.
[228:06.97]Somebody just called me washed up.
[228:10.57]Ban that person permanently.
[228:12.87]Joke's on them.
[228:13.63]Ogryns don't wash up.
[228:15.29]True.
[228:16.81]More like unwashed up.
[228:25.72]Is there a class that can heal?
[228:32.35]It'd be fun to just be a little healer, dude.
[228:35.21]Get, like, self-heal stuff, kinda, as a Zealot.
[228:40.31]But, can't help others.
[228:43.51]Yeah, ban, ban him.
[228:45.26]We're doing great.
[228:48.82]Life.
[228:50.22]Mods, can we dox this guy?
[228:51.84]Ban him for life.
[228:57.00]Look how chilled this guy is.
[229:00.96]Oh my god.
[229:01.84]What sort of unfortunate situation occurred that led to this, I think.
[229:08.63]Ow!
[229:10.41]Why am I just shooting up here?
[229:13.19]I'm so... I am so obsessed with how this looks.
[229:18.76]Oh, the game?
[229:19.56]Yeah, it's just like it's so far away.
[229:23.02]It's amazing.
[229:35.17]If you needed healing, there was healing back there.
[229:39.51]I guess you don't know... If I say lifetime ban, it means 15 seconds.
[229:43.68]Oh shoot.
[229:57.61]Oh my god, there's so many of them.
[229:58.93]There's so many of them.
[229:59.59]They're just throwing me like a little rag doll.
[230:13.07]Oh, guys, I'm blowing up again.
[230:14.43]Get away from me.
[230:15.83]Got him.
[230:17.22]Wait.
[230:17.50]Oh, shit.
[230:18.14]Oh, shit.
[230:18.46]I'm sorry.
[230:18.72]I'm going to give you a little tip here.
[230:20.32]If you're about to blow up, save your ultimate.
[230:22.70]If you use your ultimate when you're about to blow up, it will discharge it.
[230:27.52]For higher difficulties, do you blow up easier?
[230:29.50]This was not happening until just now.
[230:32.37]Did you only just put on that staff?
[230:34.47]I upgraded it recently.
[230:36.85]I don't know.
[230:38.95]Maybe I'm just paying less attention to it.
[230:41.18]Yeah, I think enemies are harder to kill, so you might just be like... I'm so fucking locked in.
[230:45.31]Facing it off of how many enemies I kill or something.
[230:51.25]Probably gonna happen again.
[230:52.09]I got like so locked in that I was just like sitting here for the last like 10 straight minutes.
[230:56.49]You just stopped talking to the chat or just reading anything.
[230:59.96]I'm just like... I'm just like in my own head here, just playing the video game.
[231:03.88]You become an Ogryn.
[231:04.66]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[231:05.64]That's what happens to me too.
[231:07.87]Yeah, dude, when we started playing this, when Strippin first made Chug, I don't think you streamed anything else since then, right, Sam?
[231:14.85]Nope.
[231:16.13]Just Chug all day.
[231:19.27]I am Chug.
[231:23.81]Simple life.
[231:25.31]My wife, she pointed out that my sentences have become shorter.
[231:31.43]Oh, no.
[231:31.93]I'm just becoming an ogre.
[231:37.32]Everything has to be one syllable, all words.
[231:39.50]Yeah.
[231:40.04]Okay, let's go grab the next one.
[231:42.64]I need ammo.
[231:49.52]Anybody need health?
[231:50.28]I kind of do.
[231:50.80]I'm going to put healing down over here.
[231:53.92]I need it.
[231:57.30]What causes the purple buildup again?
[231:59.57]Going down in certain enemies like dogs do when a when a mutant grabs you, when a dog grabs you, any of those kind of things, poxbursters.
[232:12.01]That guy.
[232:12.71]Oh, we're good.
[232:15.03]I shot him.
[232:16.19]That was I didn't I didn't know that guy was going to blow up on you.
[232:21.48]I just saw he was red.
[232:30.23]So, do you have that charge move as Ogryn or do you have something else?
[232:36.23]I have that charge move, yeah.
[232:37.23]That's... When they add new subclasses, that move will be different.
[232:41.26]Cool.
[232:41.50]But mine's like... I have an improved version from like my feats.
[232:46.84]Wait, you used your bare feet?
[232:49.58]Wait a minute.
[232:50.58]You know like the skill you got when you hit five?
[232:52.72]Yeah.
[232:54.82]Yeah, so I have one of those at 30 that lets me charge twice as far and I can't be interrupted no matter what.
[233:00.74]That's cool.
[233:02.00]So I can like, yeah, I can like knock down all the big stuff.
[233:07.92]Oh, come on.
[233:10.30]Now they're all in.
[233:22.72]This new knife is pretty good.
[233:24.93]Oh, I need to try mine.
[233:28.35]What the heck is this?
[233:30.75]Oh, it's a circuit breaker.
[233:31.68]Oh.
[233:47.30]Ew.
[233:48.98]I just splattered like a dead dude all over my face.
[233:52.42]Is that heal still?
[233:53.10]No, I dropped it already.
[233:55.55]I got another one if you want.
[233:57.89]I saw that you were pretty low.
[234:07.42]We are gaming right now.
[234:08.86]Do you guys see this?
[234:10.28]Oh, yeah.
[234:10.66]Big gaming.
[234:12.16]The dude keeps getting in stream.
[234:17.19]Hi, everyone.
[234:17.71]Sorry.
[234:20.15]Oh, no!
[234:20.87]I've been sniped.
[234:21.45]Be careful.
[234:23.33]There's a guy down there with a sniper.
[234:26.23]He's a sniper, yeah.
[234:28.11]Ooh, he got me.
[234:30.53]Thanks, Smush.
[234:32.25]You're very welcome.
[234:35.16]So we get extra money and extra experience for doing it on hard?
[234:38.80]Yes.
[234:39.62]Yeah.
[234:40.16]More money, more experience.
[234:41.12]And then if you do the water fires, you get even more money and experience.
[234:47.80]What am I doing?
[234:48.46]You're like, I want to be on this side.
[234:50.28]Somebody said, he keeps doing the great stomp lady noise.
[234:54.76]Yeah, that's me.
[234:55.98]Oh, that is what that is.
[234:58.94]I started doing that when I was like 17.
[235:00.89]I thought the video was so funny.
[235:02.37]So whenever I got hurt, I would make that sound.
[235:04.71]Now it's just second nature.
[235:06.27]Whoops.
[235:08.61]Well, I'm down here.
[235:10.85]That's my Marvel script moment.
[235:15.17]That hurts.
[235:20.86]Oh my god, don't shoot me.
[235:22.30]I'm in trouble.
[235:26.10]Oh, I'm in big trouble here.
[235:27.74]Oh, there's a lot of shotgunners here.
[235:29.78]This is the most I've ever seen.
[235:30.98]What the fuck?
[235:33.98]What do I do?
[235:37.52]Okay, most of them are dead.
[235:39.72]Never, not even.
[235:40.48]Alright, alright, good job.
[235:44.84]I'm gonna get inside this guy's mind.
[235:46.12]Watch this.
[235:50.05]What's up?
[235:50.71]We need a healing station or something.
[236:02.36]Yeah, this is bad news.
[236:16.72]Oh, no.
[236:19.62]Oh.
[236:20.32]I tried to get out of the way.
[236:22.26]Oh, actually, I'm good.
[236:22.86]Thanks.
[236:28.93]Well, something in here.
[236:30.93]Please be ammo.
[236:31.45]Please be ammo.
[236:32.51]Why would there be nothing in a box?
[236:34.01]Why would you ever close a box, lock a box, and have nothing inside of it?
[236:39.43]Who put that box here?
[236:40.45]Why is this box even here?
[236:42.57]Why do you think they're, you know, heretics?
[236:45.25]Yeah, man.
[236:46.01]That's something a heretic would do.
[236:48.23]Really?
[236:48.55]It's not what happened, bud.
[236:50.57]You want to talk about it?
[236:52.32]Well, I'm opening boxes and there's no ammo.
[236:54.66]And here we are again.
[236:56.80]Gosh.
[237:00.30]Is there anything in this one?
[237:03.91]There we go.
[237:04.65]This one's got ammo in it.
[237:11.55]Oh, they have like a little team guarding me.
[237:14.30]I got a big bag of ammo over here.
[237:18.04]Big ammo.
[237:19.32]Did anybody need it?
[237:20.00]Or can I take it?
[237:21.12]No, no.
[237:21.30]You're good.
[237:21.56]Oh my god.
[237:23.20]That is a big one.
[237:24.44]Uh-oh.
[237:28.82]Oh my god.
[237:29.32]I think that explosion saved me.
[237:34.92]That's a lot of health.
[237:35.66]Look at this.
[237:36.12]Look at this little captive prisoner.
[237:37.49]Leave me here, guys.
[237:41.05]I don't deserve to join the team.
[237:43.49]Not until I get some cool swag.
[237:46.15]You're like our mascot.
[237:47.31]Yeah, does it heal here?
[237:56.74]Oh, the little three things tell you how many people can use it.
[237:59.44]I see.
[238:03.01]I guess people with purple should get prioritized, right?
[238:05.93]Yeah.
[238:06.19]You can grab it.
[238:06.96]It's good.
[238:08.52]Okay.
[238:09.92]I'll take it first.
[238:14.66]Yeah.
[238:14.86]Next time you're about to blow up, Snot, try using your F. Alright.
[238:20.51]I'll give it a shot.
[238:21.53]It should save you.
[238:24.43]Snot.
[238:26.57]Snot.
[238:27.69]Little Snot.
[238:30.09]Where are we going?
[238:30.53]Do we go down or up?
[238:33.40]Up.
[238:36.44]Oh, I got netted.
[238:37.20]I can't wreck it.
[238:39.56]Oh my God.
[238:40.14]Watch out.
[238:40.46]There's a big dude.
[238:42.04]He's just walking over to snipe.
[238:45.52]Did that sound weird?
[238:47.12]I have both headphones in and I'm like really locked in.
[238:49.46]I feel like I just sounded very weird.
[238:51.85]That was a very natural laugh.
[238:53.19]Was it though?
[238:54.55]Yeah.
[238:55.33]You're having a good time, man.
[238:57.35]I'm self-conscious.
[239:01.83]That poses a bigger question though.
[239:04.11]When you're aware of your luck, is it your real luck?
[239:07.06]If a tree laughs in the woods and no one's around.
[239:10.10]I think what we just did was the authentic luck.
[239:16.14]Self-conscious Andy.
[239:17.46]What a way to insult someone.
[239:23.89]You know when you have two headphones in and you're really just gaming and you're kind of like a speech jamming yourself?
[239:28.89]Wait, do you not usually have two headphones in?
[239:32.28]Dude, I usually... Right ear only.
[239:34.42]Always.
[239:34.68]100%.
[239:35.26]Really?
[239:35.60]100%.
[239:35.96]That's like a... Are there like other things going on around you that you require the other ear for or is it just habit?
[239:43.28]I need to be able to hear myself in a natural environment.
[239:47.61]Oh my god.
[239:50.57]Okay, hold on.
[239:51.49]Put it back in.
[239:54.88]No, I'm kind of with you on that because I had these headphones that were too noise-canceling and I had to figure out how to get live feedback so that I could think straight.
[240:05.36]Yeah.
[240:06.00]It was weird.
[240:06.46]It feels like you're in a sensory deprivation zone.
[240:09.73]Yeah, I know that's like the opening, but it's not even just the fact that it's covering my ears and the sound in both ears.
[240:15.81]It's it is.
[240:16.47]It's happening right now.
[240:20.51]I'm dead.
[240:22.31]It's because of the speech jammer.
[240:23.87]Alright, there's a sniper.
[240:26.54]Where is the sniper?
[240:27.88]If you're in the corner, you're good.
[240:29.04]Just stay in the corner.
[240:30.10]Yeah.
[240:31.10]Oh, boy.
[240:31.80]I hope in one second I got to deal with.
[240:34.68]Oh, my God.
[240:35.22]Alright.
[240:36.44]We're coming for you guys.
[240:39.98]I almost just blew, guys.
[240:42.78]I'm getting better at managing my, uh... Alright, here you go.
[240:47.00]Oh, thank you.
[240:48.04]Come here, Smush.
[240:48.58]Let's get you up.
[240:49.78]Thanks.
[240:51.00]Nice work.
[240:51.49]Uh, uh, Smush thanks you.
[240:57.01]Oh, good, good, good.
[240:58.79]Snot appreciates it.
[241:00.39]Uh, Smush says that he's very grateful for all of your contributions.
[241:07.74]Maybe just do a voice, you know, you don't have to freaking like I think my computer just crashed my whole computer He's walking into the wall is my life.
[241:20.87]Oh my god.
[241:22.79]Oh Yes, the Lord behind this why did he just disappear the walk took him am I live still oh
[241:32.16]You can rejoin.
[241:33.24]Oh, okay.
[241:34.00]I don't think it shuts off your OBS, but it does stutter for a second.
[241:36.78]Oh, okay.
[241:37.12]Alright.
[241:37.44]I'm coming.
[241:38.24]We've had that happen.
[241:40.32]Dude, literally all my windows turned off at the same time too.
[241:43.44]Now we have Durlin.
[241:44.32]I'm coming.
[241:49.98]At least I think I'm on my way.
[241:54.26]If I just open the game, will it put me right back in?
[241:57.04]Yeah.
[241:57.44]Oh, cool.
[241:57.88]Alright.
[241:58.36]Good.
[242:04.36]Let's go.
[242:06.25]Just wait in here.
[242:10.47]No, you guys are good.
[242:11.13]Keep going.
[242:12.93]I'm joined.
[242:13.65]Derlin's giving me a dirty look.
[242:16.75]Cool level design.
[242:19.64]We did this level once already.
[242:20.82]It's a Wednesday.
[242:21.60]Alright, let's go then.
[242:22.30]YOLO.
[242:24.67]But anyways, having a speech jammer going on in both ears, that's why I always have to be able to hear myself in reality without any filter on it.
[242:37.24]You know what?
[242:37.76]That might help me.
[242:38.46]You have a filter on usually?
[242:40.44]Well, what I mean by filter is I'm hearing my voice with a little bit of dilution, like diluted, because I'm not getting my actual voice.
[242:51.07]I have headphones in both ears.
[242:52.43]Does that make sense?
[242:54.83]yeah you're hearing a muted version yeah and it just messes with me so bad something I've never actually heard my voice when I try to start talking I'll be like like repeating myself when I'm trying to start talking maybe that's what it is maybe I have like a speech jammer thing going on
[243:16.00]yeah putting one headphone in usually works but it just if there's any positional audio at all you just don't get it I have streamed before where I had the left earphone out I usually do the left earphone out almost permanently and I will not hear something coming down the left hall and I'll turn and get hit by it and people be like how did you not know that was coming like well because I physically don't have any into your into your right ear
[243:42.65]Just put them both in the right ear?
[243:44.27]Yeah, squeeze both headphones into one ear.
[243:46.85]So you still get the visual cues.
[243:49.20]That's actually really funny.
[243:51.68]Alright, I'm back.
[243:57.52]Oh, wait, I heard that little... The flamethrower guy.
[244:02.29]Yeah, right?
[244:02.79]Little Bunsen burner.
[244:04.31]Just go mono in one ear?
[244:06.01]I don't think you could even set it up that way.
[244:09.27]Can you even do that?
[244:12.95]Maybe I should try it.
[244:13.67]Hope I get credit for beating the mission, right?
[244:17.01]Yeah, you will get it.
[244:17.71]Back you tend to be out.
[244:50.90]I think I see ammo.
[244:52.10]Could use it.
[244:53.44]Oh, I have a box I can put down.
[244:54.58]Ooh.
[244:59.23]Yeah, if you want to eat at the stairs once we get this growth, put it down.
[245:05.34]I think I'm going to train myself to deal with loud noises.
[245:08.00]I'm going to start putting a distortion effect on my computer and turning it up to like 300%.
[245:11.49]Yeah.
[245:12.17]It's like while you're watching TV.
[245:16.21]Yeah.
[245:16.79]Any particular end game for that?
[245:19.31]Just to make myself stronger.
[245:21.07]Oh, cool.
[245:22.10]You can do sub alerts that just scream at you.
[245:24.44]Yeah.
[245:25.00]Yeah.
[245:29.57]I bet there's no downsides to that either.
[245:31.78]Yeah, there's no way you would develop some kind of behavioral-induced fear.
[245:38.52]It's like taking a little bit of poison every day so you become immune.
[245:41.79]Dude, I actually blew out my left eardrum when I was sick a couple of years ago.
[245:48.60]I blew my nose too hard, and it was like, boom!
[245:52.40]And I could feel it, and it hurt.
[245:54.86]Oh, God.
[245:55.30]No, this is for real.
[245:57.06]And now, now I have, like, a little tiny ear ringing in my left ear.
[246:02.20]Oh, it's horrible.
[246:02.98]Yeah, it sucks.
[246:04.12]It's not that bad.
[246:05.10]It had to be in a dead silent room with no sound effects, but I hear it.
[246:10.16]It's annoying.
[246:13.64]I feel like, you think you could, like, blow it back, you know?
[246:17.26]Like go the other way?
[246:18.36]Yeah.
[246:19.40]I bet we could put you in a big microwave for a minute and it might fix some problems.
[246:24.28]Not even like a minute.
[246:25.14]Like micro dosing a microwave.
[246:27.06]Like put you in there for like a second and a half.
[246:30.50]What the fuck?
[246:31.66]You grow immune to radiation.
[246:33.02]That's how it works.
[246:34.34]That's how you can become immune.
[246:36.22]Yeah, that's what the Hulk did, right?
[246:37.92]That is what the Hulk did.
[246:38.65]Your chart book is full of really cool and brave ideas.
[246:42.91]He TikTok'd himself in a microwave?
[246:46.13]He TikTok'd?
[246:48.55]keep yawning.
[246:51.69]I actually went to an ENT about it and it was kind of weird because they were just like, yeah, that's it.
[247:00.06]Your ears are going to ring.
[247:00.88]I'm just like, is there anything I can do about it?
[247:03.86]Nah.
[247:05.42]I paid for this.
[247:06.48]I paid for this advice.
[247:08.74]Well, they looked.
[247:09.28]They checked.
[247:11.59]There was no real damage to my ear, but it was just like, yeah, it's just the way it is.
[247:14.89]I'm like, okay.
[247:19.71]Listen, you let me give you medical advice, and I think we could probably get that hearing back.
[247:30.70]There was this supplement that had... I forget what the actual supplement was, but it sometimes maybe works for some people, but I don't know if there's even any evidence that it works.
[247:42.33]Um, what's it called?
[247:43.47]It's got a specific name.
[247:44.25]It's like an herb.
[247:46.99]Oregano.
[247:47.45]Ow.
[247:48.25]Ow.
[247:48.69]Yeah, just eat extra.
[247:50.17]Just put oregano on your pizza and it'll be better.
[247:54.65]I just got hurt a lot.
[247:56.17]Oh god.
[248:01.50]It's like an amino acid or something.
[248:03.20]I forget what it was.
[248:07.12]You just saved my life.
[248:09.16]Hey, anytime.
[248:12.14]You guys look like you need a med kit.
[248:21.49]I could use a med kit.
[248:26.78]Are we sharing it or are you guys going to drink most of it?
[248:29.50]Because we and Chug literally only got like one sniff of that.
[248:34.84]I think maybe there's a finite amount of healing it can do.
[248:37.28]Yeah, there is.
[248:38.28]Oh, cool.
[248:39.60]He started doing it in character and he's like, ah, I can't do it.
[248:44.23]He takes over.
[248:45.77]Yeah, it's not even a conscious decision at this point.
[248:52.36]Oh, boy.
[248:52.78]Oh, wait.
[248:53.26]Smush, I got a thing for you to do.
[248:54.66]You do?
[248:55.74]What should I do?
[248:56.80]Come over here.
[248:58.42]Yep.
[248:59.16]Do you have any grenades?
[249:02.94]No.
[249:03.16]Okay.
[249:03.60]Let's try and find you a grenade.
[249:06.28]If anyone finds grenades.
[249:08.47]You can get a cosmetic.
[249:10.77]You can get a cosmetic as an Ogryn if you throw a grenade at the eyeball.
[249:15.73]Really?
[249:16.25]Yeah, and you kill it in one hit.
[249:19.79]I got downed, guys.
[249:20.59]They don't want me to stand up.
[249:23.60]Um, what's happening to me?
[249:28.11]It's not.
[249:29.05]What was that?
[249:31.57]That was very weird.
[249:32.81]Let's see.
[249:35.85]Grenade.
[249:36.47]No, it's alright.
[249:38.55]We did it.
[249:39.73]Oh, you did it?
[249:40.33]I think there's more of them, though.
[249:50.72]Oh, shit.
[250:01.14]Thanks, Chug.
[250:04.26]Chug, you might need to follow me this way and get ready to pick me up.
[250:07.14]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[250:08.82]That's a lot of talks versus I hear.
[250:10.14]I actually just killed by a default shitty guy.
[250:15.83]I'm actually pissed off.
[250:16.81]I got beat by a default guy with a hammer in his hand.
[250:23.07]Thank you.
[250:24.05]Oh my lord.
[250:26.81]I don't know how to predict that that's going to happen.
[250:30.32]What?
[250:30.56]Who's this?
[250:32.18]Things just keep happening to me.
[250:33.50]Alright, let's go home, guys.
[250:35.30]Come on.
[250:36.86]You did it.
[250:37.34]I'm proud of you.
[250:40.95]Oh, we've got a big group coming from our anatomical left.
[250:52.15]What the hell was that?
[250:55.03]That was my phone, sorry.
[251:08.24]Copernicus!
[251:10.44]Yeah?
[251:11.36]You good?
[251:15.06]I'm good.
[251:21.50]Enemy.
[251:23.20]Enemy.
[251:25.24]Where did they all come from?
[251:26.16]I am dead.
[251:39.07]Sorry, you guys get up.
[251:44.11]Are we able to rescue him this late?
[251:46.09]I don't think so.
[251:47.42]Yes, we are.
[251:48.36]I'm just dead.
[251:51.98]Saving private.
[252:00.46]Oh, I did respond.
[252:06.48]Oh, my elbow.
[252:07.34]Thank you.
[252:09.29]So ungrateful.
[252:16.06]Oh, right, right.
[252:16.56]Sorry, I forgot to role play.
[252:18.27]Thank you.
[252:20.31]Thank you.
[252:24.83]Thank you.
[252:27.21]Thank you.
[252:27.85]Hey, we did it.
[252:33.94]Oh, hey.
[252:36.50]The camera pan over to him.
[252:40.82]We're good.
[252:42.28]Easy.
[252:42.68]Yeah, you guys should get a bunch, a lot of experience for that.
[252:47.39]That's a lot.
[252:50.09]Holy shit, that's an entire level.
[252:51.51]Alright.
[252:55.23]Oh, I unlocked a new weapon.
[252:58.16]This day just keeps getting better.
[253:00.58]Rumbler.
[253:01.00]I think I got Roman for one more.
[253:09.58]One more?
[253:11.21]Let's do one more hard one.
[253:14.76]I think we're ready for a five.
[253:16.44]Oh, God.
[253:17.66]Just skip four altogether.
[253:22.34]Also, again, this is sponsored.
[253:23.78]I really do appreciate it.
[253:25.56]Playing a little bit extra.
[253:27.12]Game's really fun.
[253:28.49]I'll be playing it again.
[253:31.47]But yeah, Warhammer, thanks a lot for the sponsor.
[253:33.95]It's been a lot of fun.
[253:35.57]Game is available for pre-order.
[253:36.85]The beta is currently ongoing right now.
[253:40.57]It is pre-order available.
[253:43.39]Get you access to the beta.
[253:44.41]The game comes out on the 30th, as you see.
[253:46.33]Pre-order beta test November 17th to the 29th.
[253:50.12]Game releases in full on the 30th.
[253:52.36]Seems like they are working pretty much double time here.
[253:56.83]Seems like they get some stability patches, I think, and some stuff ready for the actual launch.
[254:02.25]So I will definitely be playing this again.
[254:05.47]And we'll go from there.
[254:06.96]It's been a blast.
[254:09.98]Let's keep going.
[254:10.58]We'll do one more.
[254:12.90]This should be a level where you go get slimed like Nickelodeon.
[254:18.51]They put you in a big chair.
[254:20.01]Is there a map we haven't done yet?
[254:23.37]Yes.
[254:29.32]This one.
[254:32.64]This one is rank three lights out and scriptures.
[254:38.52]So.
[254:40.64]So pretend the scriptures isn't there because you're not going to find them in the dark.
[254:43.84]Yeah, in the dark.
[254:46.58]I've got quite the keen eye.
[254:48.46]Let's do lights out.
[254:49.20]I think we can do it.
[254:50.84]You want to do lights out?
[254:51.84]Alright.
[254:52.62]Let's do lights out.
[254:56.93]Also, let me clarify that.
[254:57.73]When I say work in double time, I just mean that they're dedicated to making sure the launch is good.
[255:03.61]I think they already have plans for patches and stuff.
[255:06.92]I don't mean like, oh, they're working triple time or something.
[255:09.36]I just want to clear that up.
[255:12.68]It's called a trauma force staff.
[255:16.40]Oh, that's kind of sad.
[255:17.80]What do you need flashlights for?
[255:20.38]If it's dark.
[255:20.88]Are we going to see?
[255:25.48]Do the Auburns not ever get a flashlight?
[255:28.42]No.
[255:30.55]That's so weird.
[255:31.27]Can't you just use your flame up?
[255:33.81]I don't know if the flames give off light.
[255:37.17]Listen to what you just said.
[255:38.51]Yeah, but, you know, video game limitations and all that, man.
[255:41.97]That big bright thing coming out of your gun.
[255:45.06]It doesn't seem to.
[255:45.74]I think it's just damage.
[255:47.10]Yeah.
[255:47.96]I can try it.
[255:49.68]But if it doesn't work, then letting the way with holding fire is going to be a little difficult.
[255:57.02]Are there any new weapons?
[256:00.64]Did it tell you that you unlocked any when you leveled up?
[256:03.48]Yeah, I did.
[256:05.91]Let me see if I can upgrade one of these.
[256:08.81]Oh my god, I can afford pants.
[256:11.93]No, I shouldn't though.
[256:13.49]I could also wait three minutes for a different mission.
[256:25.80]Oh yeah, the weapon shop upgrades in three minutes too.
[256:28.20]It refreshes.
[256:30.88]You want to just chill for a couple minutes and just redo all this?
[256:33.88]Okay, okay.
[256:34.71]Sure.
[256:34.91]I want to take a look at this anyways.
[256:41.39]Did I get any?
[256:46.48]I've done multiple missions now, and I still haven't gotten this blue currency.
[256:52.97]In the Shrine of Omnimonosnasha?
[256:56.87]They look like little squares in the level.
[257:00.71]This club, the reason why I'm not trying to buy it is because it was what I started with, but that's not how this works.
[257:08.94]Just because you started with the default weapon does not mean, oh yeah, that's the default weapon.
[257:12.52]You don't want that thing.
[257:13.78]It's just a weapon.
[257:16.47]Should I get it?
[257:16.93]Yeah.
[257:17.79]So you can get like a really good club leader.
[257:20.81]What do you think?
[257:24.01]The way the game determines the gear you get in the shop is it takes the highest level piece of gear in your bag or on your person.
[257:31.83]So if you buy something, even if you don't want to use it, if it's like a big upgrade, it means that when your shop refreshes next time, you'll have like better stuff in there.
[257:39.98]Oh, okay.
[257:42.52]That's good to know.
[257:43.16]Well, I don't know if I have enough money.
[257:47.16]You can also sell old stuff.
[257:48.62]I don't know if you've done that, but if you press I and then hover over your items, you can hold X to sell them.
[257:55.19]And that's some easy cash.
[257:58.13]That's actually a great.
[258:00.57]I don't want to sell everything, but just the stuff I probably won't use.
[258:03.89]Yeah, just like your old stuff.
[258:07.77]Is it bad to sell greens?
[258:10.68]No.
[258:11.20]No?
[258:11.52]No.
[258:12.80]You get more based on the rarity, too.
[258:14.52]Okay.
[258:24.58]One minute remaining.
[258:25.56]Let's see what we got.
[258:33.35]but 10k shouldn't have sold yeah it's alright though watch me regret not buying this right now it's gonna be all greens
[259:04.59]It's been fun.
[259:05.35]But I can go over... Let's go over what's going on next week.
[259:10.11]I will be back on Tuesday.
[259:12.79]Got something interesting going on on Tuesday.
[259:17.43]I'm going to be playing something.
[259:19.46]I don't want to spoil it, but... Ster.
[259:24.38]Maybe somebody else.
[259:25.42]I don't want to spoil it.
[259:26.04]I don't want to spoil it.
[259:27.88]I'm going to be playing a fun game on the 29th.
[259:32.53]we'll be playing this again on launch.
[259:35.17]So I'm actually happy about that because that's going to be a lot of fun because I think the game's really good.
[259:39.41]And then on the first, something very interesting and unusual is happening.
[259:45.01]Not on my stream.
[259:48.19]You'll hear about it very soon.
[259:51.66]So that should be fun too.
[259:53.38]That's the plan for next week.
[259:59.38]Did Ster already talk about it?
[260:08.36]Did Ster talk about it?
[260:14.08]Yeah?
[260:15.28]Oh, okay.
[260:18.60]I had the hiccups for, like, an hour straight the other day, and I was almost in tears by the end of that hour.
[260:25.05]I don't think you can survive a full year.
[260:27.51]I'm telling you.
[260:29.47]No mortal man.
[260:31.81]That's too much.
[260:32.47]Okay, this is better.
[260:39.16]Hello.
[260:40.10]Hello.
[260:40.48]Sorry, I was muted.
[260:42.92]You think you could survive a whole year of hiccuping, Jerma?
[260:48.38]How often does it happen?
[260:50.02]Like on the normal average of having hiccups.
[260:53.98]Every like 30 seconds to a minute, two minutes?
[260:56.60]Yeah.
[260:58.46]Yeah.
[260:58.96]No, no, I don't think so.
[261:00.46]That's what I'm saying.
[261:01.60]People keep saying they could survive it.
[261:03.46]Is the money involved?
[261:05.23]Yeah, you would get a sum of money, but that's not too important.
[261:08.99]Well, no, it is very important.
[261:09.99]How much?
[261:11.10]I don't know.
[261:11.56]A hundred, a million dollars.
[261:12.78]I was going to say a hundred, a hundred dollars.
[261:17.32]For a hundred million dollars, I think the answer is yes.
[261:21.34]But your life might be at stake.
[261:24.14]No, it would just be really annoying for a year but then you have a hundred million dollars for the rest of your life.
[261:29.00]Think about the anatomy of the human body.
[261:31.00]I don't know about you guys but sometimes my hiccups like hurt really bad.
[261:33.00]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[261:34.00]Likem you- you get the hiccups after like dude after two days of hiccuping straight, even in your sleep you're gonna be like you're gonna be on your knees like begging for someone to just like cancel the deal.
[261:47.00]You wouldn't be able to sleep, you'd like die of sleep deprivation.
[261:51.11]But hold on, but do you hiccup in your sleep?
[261:54.83]Yeah, it would be a year straight of just hiccuping.
[261:59.55]So you wouldn't, you would wake up every, that wouldn't make any sense.
[262:02.85]You wouldn't be able to.
[262:05.70]That's why I say consider it carefully.
[262:07.44]Criken doesn't want to think about it.
[262:09.06]He just thinks he can do it.
[262:11.34]You would sign yourself up and you would just be in agony.
[262:15.97]So all the lights out ones just went away and turned into endless horde.
[262:18.58]So, uh, back in the endless horde zone, but I think ready for any mission.
[262:25.90]I don't think we've done this.
[262:29.52]Your body would get used to it.
[262:30.36]I think your body, I think it probably would.
[262:31.92]I don't know if it would happen in your REM sleep.
[262:34.53]I don't think it's possible.
[262:35.33]Your body like shuts down a bunch of features, doesn't it?
[262:39.03]Yeah, but you also accepted a curse, man.
[262:40.79]I don't think the curse cares about your body's features.
[262:43.95]That's true.
[262:44.71]You're hiccuping every 30 seconds.
[262:48.17]For a year.
[262:48.97]I wonder if that muscle would get pretty buff.
[262:51.99]Oh, you would be so buff at that hiccup muscle.
[262:54.98]I wonder if you could medically induce sleep, though, and just hiccup through it.
[262:58.00]Yeah, definitely.
[262:59.44]You'd get used to it.
[263:00.20]Then your body would adapt.
[263:01.08]Go into crypto sleep for a year.
[263:04.10]Yeah, this is my last one.
[263:05.74]Are you guys going to keep playing after this?
[263:08.53]I think we'll play a little bit more.
[263:11.37]At least I will.
[263:12.49]I think Tomato might be joining us.
[263:14.19]I don't know if I want to play.
[263:16.43]Pizza just got here.
[263:19.05]If you think you're still going, I'll raid you after it's over.
[263:22.63]Oh, thanks.
[263:23.91]You can just eat the pizza while playing, like Jerma did, remember?
[263:27.33]I like to eat on stream.
[263:28.47]What if I get the hiccups?
[263:35.15]Alright.
[263:36.03]Let's make it a good one.
[263:38.94]I just want four.
[263:40.56]I want four of the character that you're playing to all harmonize at the same time.
[264:00.39]Yeah, you can have multiple people all have the same voice.
[264:04.71]Oh, yeah.
[264:06.17]Wait, so this big dude can have that little tiny voice?
[264:09.08]Uh, no.
[264:09.66]It's classical.
[264:11.30]You didn't lie.
[264:13.36]You misunderstood me.
[264:14.44]Ooh, this knife is good.
[264:17.71]Ooh.
[264:27.61]What should I eat tonight?
[264:28.43]What do you guys think?
[264:29.99]Any recommendations?
[264:30.61]What did you eat yesterday?
[264:33.99]Thanksgiving dinner?
[264:36.75]Come on.
[264:37.01]You got enough to eat for like three or four days.
[264:39.95]I could just eat that.
[264:41.29]Some mayonnaise sandwiches.
[264:42.21]Mayonnaise sandwiches.
[264:44.49]So do you want something light?
[264:45.54]Do you want something the opposite of Thanksgiving?
[264:48.20]Or do you want to keep riding the Thanksgiving train?
[264:50.40]I actually might just ride the Thanksgiving wave, I think.
[264:57.73]But if it wasn't that, then what?
[264:59.37]What do you think?
[265:02.25]If it wasn't that?
[265:03.31]Yeah, what are you guys' favorite foods?
[265:04.68]Like, what do you guys would say?
[265:07.32]I feel like maybe a nice pasta dish would be like the opposite of a Thanksgiving thing.
[265:12.93]I like it.
[265:13.25]It's a comfy one, yeah.
[265:17.54]You know, I'll be honest, ever since we went to that chicken katsu place in Vegas, I've started ordering chicken katsu because it was so fucking good.
[265:26.36]I've been chasing the high ever since.
[265:27.70]Yeah, it's just unbeatable.
[265:30.55]It's so good.
[265:31.57]It's like a Japanese curry, like breaded chicken.
[265:36.83]But it's like this kind of deep spice, unlike other curries.
[265:40.47]It's a really interesting thing.
[265:41.71]It is fantastic.
[265:44.32]That's actually not a bad idea.
[265:45.60]One of my favorite places to go in LA was Coca.
[265:50.56]The car was so good.
[265:51.58]Oh, I don't know if I've been there.
[265:53.28]What?
[265:53.48]Did we go there together?
[265:55.00]Where's the sniper?
[265:56.94]We must have.
[265:57.62]We went one time for like ramen, I remember.
[266:00.46]You haven't been?
[266:01.12]I don't know if I've been there.
[266:02.22]You lived there.
[266:03.78]Yeah, it was a big city.
[266:04.82]I'm just somebody to eat shit for fun.
[266:06.56]It can't be that big.
[266:07.46]What did I do?
[266:09.82]Get some ammo, pal.
[266:11.76]I got a healing crate.
[266:19.72]Well, next time you go out to eat, man, you know where to go.
[266:22.09]Coco.
[266:23.29]Oh, shit.
[266:23.61]I'm not even with you guys.
[266:24.39]I'm just being a weirdo.
[266:25.07]That's a big line of gunmen.
[266:27.91]I hear a dog.
[266:32.39]Thank goodness.
[266:34.49]I would have probably died.
[266:35.27]Have I been to Sugarfish?
[266:42.12]Yeah, Sugarfish is amazing.
[266:44.72]There's a staple out here.
[266:48.29]If I'm having a really bad day, a really good day, then I will order sugarfish.
[266:51.55]What is sugarfish?
[266:53.03]Sushi!
[266:54.53]Yeah, sushi place that's really high quality.
[266:57.12]You know, I have not had sushi in a long time.
[267:04.38]It fell off real bad for me, though.
[267:05.78]I kind of stopped wanting it.
[267:07.65]Oh, I fell off!
[267:08.55]Help!
[267:10.19]Oh my god, you did, Copernicus.
[267:12.51]Am I stuck?
[267:15.62]Uh-oh.
[267:17.38]Oh, that's a lot of people.
[267:18.34]I just panicked.
[267:25.30]I probably shouldn't have done what I just did.
[267:28.28]Oh my goodness.

[270:15.21]What do they have to say?
[270:17.30]About the Oh My God guy?

[270:44.17]I'm not going to lie, I'm kind of getting cracked out here.

[271:07.93]Oh.
[271:08.33]Grenades here.
[271:08.89]Can't jump through that.

[271:16.27]Oh.
[271:16.83]I'm so sorry.
[271:17.51]I didn't know what I did.
[271:18.35]There's another one.
[271:19.29]What the heck?
[271:21.09]Wait.
[271:21.35]Is he dead?
[271:21.87]Yeah.
[271:22.63]He's dead.
[271:23.58]Fucking dying.
[271:24.36]Jump.
[271:24.62]Come here.
[271:24.96]Come here.
[271:27.52]That was scammy.
[271:29.18]Keep going that way.
[271:29.86]Straight to the end.
[271:31.62]This way?
[271:32.04]Oh, here.
[271:32.48]Yeah.
[271:32.84]Yep.
[271:33.52]I will try and find our friend.
[271:34.98]Oops.
[271:45.77]I'm gonna press G. There he is.
[271:49.13]I see him.
[271:50.67]Hey, guys.
[271:55.67]Thanks, Chug.
[271:59.47]You go back and get that healing snot, you hear me?
[272:01.29]Big guy!
[272:01.95]Alright, I'm on it.
[272:02.77]Which way is it?
[272:04.17]That way, then left.
[272:05.41]Oh, you're not kidding.
[272:06.99]Straight through the door in front of you.
[272:08.38]Nice.
[272:09.06]Just fucking throw a box at him.
[272:11.38]I hit him twice.
[272:13.74]Where all those guys are coming from?
[272:15.24]That's the way.
[272:15.96]I'm going to try to deal with these guys first.
[272:22.60]These guys aren't playing around.
[272:25.60]That's what happens when you play the game on fucking hard, kid.
[272:27.80]Alright.
[272:29.20]Straight down that corridor.
[272:30.40]Just all the way to the end.
[272:32.82]On it.
[272:36.99]Oh my god, I've been- I've been found.
[272:39.49]There's a lot of people here found.
[272:41.35]Oh my god, he's dying.
[272:43.02]Guys, it's okay.
[272:43.98]It's just one enemy.
[272:44.68]I can handle him.
[272:47.11]I just saw you missed four times.
[272:48.99]Yeah, it was actually more like eight.
[272:51.14]You just happened to come in at the last four.
[272:52.94]Alright, a hound dog has found me.
[272:55.74]Oh, no.
[272:56.34]He's going to die.
[272:57.42]I got him.
[272:57.94]I'm fine, guys.
[272:58.54]I'm fine.
[272:58.96]You got people running into that room you guys are in, by the way.
[273:01.80]We're never leaving this place.
[273:05.74]This is not bad.
[273:06.94]It's not.
[273:07.34]We have to go, man.
[273:10.30]Oh, my God.
[273:10.70]I almost blew myself up.
[273:11.70]Where are they even coming from?
[273:14.65]That's what I'm saying.
[273:15.37]There's too many people in these places.
[273:18.95]Wait, how many people live in a hive city again?
[273:20.60]Do we know?
[273:20.98]90 billion.
[273:21.80]90 billion?
[273:22.86]90 billion?
[273:23.64]The specifics say that the game takes place in a school building.
[273:26.56]And it has 90 billion.
[273:27.50]What happened?
[273:36.83]That's all the people on Earth times 10.
[273:39.86]Alright, we're good.
[273:42.74]I have a heal.
[273:43.32]I don't think we need it right now though, right?
[273:45.40]No, we're good.
[273:45.98]Times 11, I guess.
[273:52.44]Dog.
[273:53.50]This shit is just exploding.
[273:59.33]Yeah, so the current augment we have is endless horde.
[274:03.17]Oh, that's what's going on.
[274:04.43]Okay.
[274:09.18]Oh, that guy goes, yeah, he's got the slime.
[274:12.60]Does the slime, is that like a boomer where it sucks up the, I mean, it attracts the horde?
[274:18.59]Uh, no.
[274:19.19]No, they just hurt.
[274:20.21]He's just out here to hurt us.
[274:22.69]Thank goodness.
[274:24.33]Why'd they call it the boomer, huh?
[274:25.63]Is he guys boom?
[274:29.45]That was probably the most brilliant name in gaming history.
[274:32.74]They probably named it before, like, the boomer stuff.
[274:37.39]Oh, I didn't even know what that was.
[274:39.85]Sorry.
[274:42.11]That little... I did it actually accidentally.
[275:03.17]What are those goofballs doing over there?
[275:05.43]Oh, right.
[275:05.99]Sorry.
[275:11.64]We're lost.
[275:12.96]Where the hell are we?
[275:13.86]Don't say that because then they'll think we're bad gamers.
[275:18.16]Oh, here, Jerma.
[275:19.10]Don't forget to buff with this thing.
[275:21.97]Bite my fucking heart out over here.
[275:24.97]Fuck.
[275:25.23]Tons of them.
[275:26.23]Yeah, there's a lot of them over here, guys.
[275:27.55]We're holding them off.
[275:28.13]They're trying to get to you.
[275:29.65]Drop down that big hole.
[275:36.70]Wow, thanks.
[275:38.78]Hey, we did most of the heavy lifting back there.
[275:41.60]Just glad you guys are alright, you know?
[275:49.09]Could I push one of the, like, one of the special infected off the map?
[275:53.95]Is that possible?
[275:54.99]Free healing for everyone.
[275:56.75]Free healing.
[275:59.64]I guess just get topped off, right?
[276:01.84]No reason not to.
[276:08.43]Yeah.
[276:08.57]Alright.
[276:12.54]That guy really... You got that guy.
[276:15.64]That guy was running up to you and just quietly put up your knife like... Oh, no.
[276:21.25]Oh, of course.
[276:23.85]Oh, my God.
[276:24.31]Help.
[276:24.65]What the fuck?
[276:25.87]Right after we hit him, too.
[276:27.75]Dude, what?
[276:29.25]What happened?
[276:30.03]He's going to hurt me.
[276:31.17]I fucked on a fucking compressed air container and flew.
[276:39.15]I'm dead.
[276:40.73]I'm gone forever.
[276:42.59]I can't move.
[276:45.33]I'm dead.
[276:47.24]I don't know what happened to me.
[276:50.14]I think the boss knocked me back.
[276:52.72]I got stuck on a pixel.
[276:54.84]It's up to you, Copernicus.
[276:55.78]He can handle this.
[276:59.31]I've been farming the Boston accent a little.
[277:08.36]Oh, God.
[277:14.68]This does not look good.
[277:16.18]Did we just lose?
[277:18.70]Bounce me over.
[277:23.10]Oh, that's... That's the end.
[277:27.94]Face first and fucking muck up.
[277:32.63]Dude, I went off the whole map.
[277:34.71]It actually launched me into the skybox.
[277:36.29]I'm not kidding.
[277:36.73]I was dead instantly.
[277:38.48]Oh, God.
[277:39.24]Yeah, that could not have gone worse.
[277:42.14]There were like 10 snipers that instantly shot me all at the same time.
[277:45.94]That's what happened with me.
[277:46.92]There was nothing I could have done.
[277:50.91]That's fair.
[277:54.11]That was fun.
[277:57.09]I did get some more currency.
[278:00.36]We still get paid for losing a little bit, you know?
[278:02.86]That's good.
[278:04.22]Get a portion.
[278:05.32]Doesn't just take the whole thing from you.
[278:07.06]The payee payment.
[278:10.58]But yeah, that's going to be it for me.
[278:12.66]Alright, man.
[278:13.92]Thanks for playing, guys.
[278:14.54]Seriously.
[278:15.49]Much easier to... It was fun.
[278:16.69]Have a good one.
[278:17.49]Yeah.
[278:19.01]It's much more fun to jump in with obviously people you've spoken to previously or just to get in the call and have fun.
[278:25.09]Hey, man.
[278:25.43]You did great.
[278:28.03]How did I do?
[278:35.14]No, no.
[278:35.70]Seriously, thanks, guys.
[278:36.96]I'll talk to you guys soon.
[278:39.32]Have a good rest of your night.
[278:41.44]Criken, you said you're still streaming?
[278:43.58]Yep.
[278:44.21]I'll just raid you.
[278:47.19]Thank you.
[278:48.01]Have a great night, guys.
[278:48.85]Thanks for sticking around.
[278:50.01]Have a good night, buddy.
[278:51.33]Hey, don't be strangers, either.
[278:53.69]Okay.
[278:53.93]See you later.
[279:00.10]So yeah, that's going to conclude the stream.
[279:02.96]That was Warhammer 40,000.
[279:04.22]That was a lot of fun.
[279:10.75]Again, Warhammer sponsoring the streams.
[279:13.63]I'll be playing it on the 30th at launch as well.
[279:17.25]Actually, really, really great game.
[279:21.83]I'm into it.
[279:22.81]We'll plan to get on the 30th.
[279:24.99]And then there's also a bunch of other stuff going on next week.
[279:27.64]I will see you guys fresh on Tuesday.
[279:34.60]And then we'll do Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[279:36.06]A couple of events going on.
[279:39.56]Yeah.
[279:43.32]That is going to be it.
[279:45.22]Again, it's available for pre-order.
[279:50.57]It is there.
[279:54.57]And take a look.
[279:59.43]How much is the game?
[280:00.45]I think it's actually not.
[280:01.85]Let me see.
[280:07.96]Get the music on.
[280:09.00]Sorry about that.
[280:15.27]It's like $40 for the game.
[280:17.13]Yeah, I mean, this game's $40.
[280:18.59]You get the base game.
[280:21.63]It seems like there's a lot to do.
[280:22.77]Seems like they're probably going to be adding a lot of stuff.
[280:27.69]That was fun.
[280:29.30]Oh, you can't even hear it.
[280:29.90]Sorry.
[280:40.66]Good night.
[280:41.02]Goodbye.
[280:42.34]Goodbye.
[280:47.04]Can you give us a clue on the December 1st stream?
[280:49.94]Nope.
[280:51.14]Because it is not my stream to announce.
[280:54.71]Let's put it that way.
[280:56.01]But once that is very clear, it's been announced, then I'll talk about it.
[281:00.07]Should be fun.
[281:01.25]It's going to be very interesting.
[281:02.45]I don't know how I feel about it.
[281:04.87]It's actually something I have never even remotely considered ever trying in my whole life ever.
[281:11.85]It's going to be very interesting.
[281:12.95]I can assure you that.
[281:19.49]Thanks for the support, though.
[281:20.31]Thanks for sticking around.
[281:21.15]These sponsored streams, the games have been actually really, really fun, so I'm really happy with them so far.
[281:33.32]Have a great night.
[281:34.16]Criken's going to keep playing it if you want to keep watching.
[281:38.56]And I'll see you guys soon.
[281:41.44]Have a good rest of your weekend.
[281:42.84]See you guys on Tuesday.
[281:45.31]I think starting early on Tuesday, somewhere around like 12 noon Pacific.
[281:50.23]1 p.m.
[281:51.93]Pacific.
[281:52.43]Somewhere between 12 and 1.
[281:53.11]Because we're going to be hanging out with Ster.
[281:58.60]Let's go ahead and get that going.
[282:06.75]See you guys later.
[282:07.95]Good night.
[282:08.39]Goodbye, Ghost of Headcracking, even though he was just here.
[282:12.27]See you later.
[282:31.57]Yeah, yeah, of course.
[282:33.08]Call your mother.
[283:20.17]you
[283:52.30]you
