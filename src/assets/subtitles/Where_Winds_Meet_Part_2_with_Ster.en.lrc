[ve:60.16.100]

[00:28.28]How have you been?
[00:29.02]Good.
[00:29.85]Good.
[00:30.29]Since yesterday when I talked to you?
[00:32.05]Very well.
[00:34.30]Hold on.
[00:35.73]There we go.
[00:37.33]I just got the medicine chest and I'm ready to game.
[00:40.30]Are you ready to game?
[00:42.26]I'm ready to game.
[00:43.75]I got my coffee.
[00:44.49]I'm just going to take a minute.
[00:47.08]Welcome to the stream, everybody.
[00:49.21]Well, Ster's been live for an hour or two.
[00:53.81]Been live for 14 hours waiting for you.
[00:58.60]I'm really tired.
[01:01.14]So what level are you in online mode?
[01:04.92]How do I look at that?
[01:06.10]Okay, if you go hit start, go to like your, it says like solo mode.
[01:10.54]If you click on that and go to online mode, I think it's our online characters.
[01:15.18]Or maybe it's not, maybe it's a combination of the two of them.
[01:21.20]Nine.
[01:22.42]Okay, so we are literally at the same place then.
[01:25.00]Okay.
[01:25.48]Yeah, I think you just did like one more thing than me on online when you killed the, uh, you did the training.
[01:30.58]Did you upgrade your heal?
[01:33.30]I just did that.
[01:34.73]Good.
[01:35.58]Alright.
[01:36.74]So welcome back, everybody.
[01:39.84]Again, hope you had a very Merry Christmas.
[01:42.38]I know, Ster, you saw it, but I had the chat Christmas.
[01:47.68]January is going to be crazy.
[01:50.51]Why?
[01:51.62]Because they opened up every package that was a stream that I was going to do in January.
[01:57.14]and almost none of the Ichio Horror landmines I put in there to pad it out.
[02:03.35]Oh, I thought you were doing those gifts.
[02:06.12]like during that stream because it looked like you opened a gift and then you played a horror game I just skimmed it yeah I was keeping up on my Jerma lore
[02:13.66]It was supposed to be that way.
[02:15.47]I thought that because I put, I think, four or five Ichio horror games in there and they landed on one.
[02:23.01]There's a guy being brought to prison in my game and everyone's throwing rocks at him in the back of the cage on the horse.
[02:30.39]Alright, so quick little recap for those of you guys.
[02:33.99]I don't want people to trickle in.
[02:34.94]They're all throwing cabbage at him.
[02:36.21]Ster's throwing rocks at somebody right now.
[02:39.95]Me and Ster have played a little bit off stream.
[02:43.86]I kind of got a little bit more familiar with the game.
[02:46.01]And this is sponsored.
[02:48.98]This is I think after the last stream.
[02:51.40]We kind of got a call back.
[02:52.42]They were like, hey, you guys want to run it back and do it again?
[02:54.81]And we're like, uh, yeah.
[02:57.62]I've been having fun with it, so...
[03:00.64]We're gonna do it again.
[03:02.99]After this, we're gonna do something that I've done four different times.
[03:08.46]I've started and stopped it four different times with four different people.
[03:13.08]We're gonna hit you with the Resident Evil 6.
[03:16.74]My chat said that you've done the Leon campaign every single time.
[03:20.32]I know.
[03:20.68]Yeah, dude, I've played Resident Evil.
[03:23.29]I just can't finish it.
[03:24.13]I've never even got halfway.
[03:27.12]Actually, no, I think I've completed it once.
[03:30.83]But we could do the Chris campaign.
[03:32.78]Because that's the one that I keep restarting the Leon campaign over and over and over again.
[03:40.37]Please do the Leon campaign again.
[03:42.20]I feel like it's cursed.
[03:45.69]Four or five years ago, I played it with Etalyx.
[03:49.16]And I don't think we finished it.
[03:50.89]And then I played it with MLC_St3alth.
[03:52.81]And then I played it with another friend.
[03:54.58]And I hit the same point in that campaign every single time.
[03:59.94]I think we have to do the Chris campaign.
[04:03.06]Play the Chris one, it sucks.
[04:05.51]No, we did finish it.
[04:06.31]Okay, we did, we did, we did.
[04:08.44]So, we'll do the Chris campaign.
[04:14.86]I'll do whatever you tell me.
[04:18.40]But yeah, I'm going to log in.
[04:20.09]You want to get me a... Oh, log in.
[04:22.36]Activated.
[04:25.80]So I think what we should do, because there's like a campaign we can do.
[04:29.47]There's like a multiplayer campaign.
[04:34.82]It looks like a couple of these.
[04:37.10]You could do it through a few different... Let's get a party first.
[04:42.50]Wait, wait, it's timing me on how many eggs I throw at this prisoner.
[04:47.94]Where are you?
[04:51.34]I want to throw eggs at somebody.
[04:52.67]What?
[04:58.04]I don't know.
[04:58.73]It was by the medicine area.
[05:00.29]Hold on.
[05:00.81]I don't know if you're able to join on a friend or how it works.
[05:05.95]Of course I'm playing as Bez Memorize.
[05:08.44]That leveled me up.
[05:10.17]Are you level 10?
[05:12.27]I think my solo level went up.
[05:14.64]I'm throwing eggs.
[05:16.45]I don't think I can see you on the map anywhere.
[05:19.22]We may have to start a...
[05:21.07]It's either called a team.
[05:22.07]I think it's called a team or a squad.
[05:24.58]I invited you to last time.
[05:25.60]Let me do that.
[05:26.25]We can do...
[05:28.13]There's a few things on the map.
[05:29.18]By the way, thank you to Everstone Studios for the sponsor.
[05:36.77]Game's available right now on Steam.
[05:38.16]It's free to play.
[05:40.12]Go check it out, Where Winds Meet.
[05:44.10]And we're gonna get going!
[05:47.44]Are you playing on an iPad?
[05:49.63]I invited you.
[05:52.58]No, I'm not currently on an iPad.
[05:53.89]I'm currently on a PC CD-ROM.
[05:57.70]Well, not a CD, you know, but a PC.
[06:00.74]Alright.
[06:01.30]Are you still throwing eggs at somebody?
[06:03.35]uh no they just passed by I like if you can find me I they're still here
[06:10.47]Oh, where are you?
[06:11.56]I think I'm the yellow dot on your map.
[06:13.51]Yeah, I can come to you.
[06:15.24]And you did get the, you got the upgrade?
[06:17.81]Yeah.
[06:19.58]You haven't seen my new character either.
[06:21.65]I have not.
[06:23.52]Wait till you see... Whoa, there are a lot of people here.
[06:27.98]Where's the guy that we're throwing rocks at?
[06:30.47]At me, yellow dot on map.
[06:33.12]Oh, there's a shitload of people here.
[06:34.25]You gotta run over the lake, man.
[06:37.62]I'm coming, coming, coming.
[06:41.02]You wouldn't want to miss this.
[06:42.74]I actually really don't want to miss this.
[06:49.04]Okay.
[06:49.95]New character.
[06:53.18]Excellent.
[06:55.45]I'm a goblin.
[06:56.56]Very good.
[06:57.50]Very good.
[06:58.51]I applaud it.
[07:00.91]I'm a goblin and I'm beautiful.
[07:04.58]And I got a matching chin.
[07:07.25]We do have a matching chin.
[07:08.98]Okay.
[07:09.36]You press, uh, F5 is the, like, zoom in camera mode.
[07:12.32]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[07:13.00]Public... Am I doing this?
[07:16.32]So this person's just being carted off to prison?
[07:18.87]Yeah.
[07:20.62]You gotta throw ten eggs at him.
[07:22.89]Oh, you missed it.
[07:25.14]Oh.
[07:25.77]What did they do?
[07:26.63]Why are they getting like carted off?
[07:28.54]I don't know.
[07:30.36]It smelled like eggs though.
[07:34.12]Okay, so here's where we should go.
[07:37.23]There is a hard multiplayer campaign, Formless Calamity.
[07:43.48]You want to ride together.
[07:44.51]What does that mean?
[07:45.09]Yeah.
[07:46.98]Okay.
[07:47.10]Uh, do you want to do, uh, this one seems a little easier forging of years.
[07:54.57]I'll do that.
[07:55.00]I'll do anything.
[07:55.64]You want to do that one?
[07:56.82]Okay.
[07:57.99]Okay, we unlocked that at level 41, so we can't do that.
[08:01.20]We can do this one, though.
[08:05.63]Okay, this one is Formless Calamity.
[08:07.25]I think you're like not seeing what's happening.
[08:10.31]I'm going to recommend this to the team leader.
[08:12.58]Okay.
[08:13.50]See if we can do it.
[08:15.75]Did you get... Wandering paths.
[08:18.56]What are we doing?
[08:22.03]Two to five players.
[08:23.84]We can do it with two.
[08:24.54]We're good.
[08:25.35]It says start matchmaking.
[08:27.74]Do we have to do it with five people?
[08:29.07]Is it like a raid?
[08:34.25]It might be.
[08:35.95]Can you run somewhere with this?
[08:38.58]Oh, no.
[08:38.89]I got us.
[08:39.27]We entered without people.
[08:40.19]Oh, there we go.
[08:42.58]Okay.
[08:42.70]Thank you, chat.
[08:46.21]That's the horse run skin.
[08:47.58]Alright, the red shield icon and it gives a damage targeting mark.
[08:51.33]Wanderer with this mark will generate an even higher threat.
[08:54.32]I'm going to be the threat.
[08:57.43]Alright, so I think we just have to fight this guy.
[09:01.01]We have five revives?
[09:02.10]Let's just kick his ass.
[09:05.47]been a minute how do we activate them do we have to like talk to him okay well here we come alright the void king
[09:18.07]Alright, I rebound my parry to L1.
[09:22.61]I don't know if you did that too.
[09:25.87]I don't know what I did.
[09:27.61]It's just been a minute.
[09:28.64]Oh my god, he killed me.
[09:32.64]He actually has a shitload of health.
[09:41.44]Can I lock on to allies?
[09:44.28]Howling wind.
[09:45.20]What does it say?
[09:46.18]Be careful.
[09:47.29]Guide the boss's direction?
[09:54.74]Are you getting heals?
[09:56.17]Kind of.
[09:56.57]Dodge the attacks and spread out.
[10:00.16]I think this is a raid.
[10:05.89]Yeah.
[10:06.82]I think we might need other people.
[10:08.39]Maybe we need more than two people.
[10:10.87]Alright, we're doing it.
[10:21.81]Hey, can we pause?
[10:22.51]I gotta take a shit.
[10:24.32]Um... No.
[10:26.25]You can deal with that later.
[10:27.90]And stop bringing that up during the sponsor stream.
[10:31.73]Don't make me look bad.
[10:39.27]I think we actually can do this.
[10:41.92]We have tickled this guy.
[10:45.17]We have to deflect, deflect!
[10:46.51]Weaken him, weaken him, weaken him!
[10:48.20]Weaken him, weaken him!
[11:02.39]Stay away from the marker.
[11:05.69]Should I get in the wind?
[11:06.34]Is that bad?
[11:07.65]Oh no, that's yours.
[11:09.75]That wind is not mine, but the healing was mine.
[11:11.74]I want to throw eggs at somebody again.
[11:20.03]Oh my god, he just caught me.
[11:29.09]I'm parrying that, right?
[11:30.41]Yeah.
[11:33.14]We are never killing this guy.
[11:34.69]Look at his health.
[11:35.39]It's gonna take like an hour.
[11:38.20]Did it say recommended five players?
[11:45.24]We're doing fine.
[11:46.24]It said two to five.
[11:47.39]Once we get him down, the shield down, we should be able to do damage to him.
[11:57.73]Oh my god, that hurts.
[12:00.00]Nothing.
[12:00.34]I think I was in the border.
[12:02.47]You're gonna fight this guy the whole stream?
[12:04.76]I think we need to give up, man.
[12:07.82]Well, let's at least get him down to whatever we can get him down to.
[12:13.62]Oh my, why do I have zero flasks?
[12:16.30]Did I, I think I forgot to sit at a bonfire.
[12:19.18]I said it like a thingy.
[12:28.30]Got a bounty stone or something.
[12:32.20]Hey, well, he's not killing us.
[12:33.55]That's a good thing, right?
[12:35.46]that's something deflect I think I got it
[12:44.01]Yeah, I took a big chunk.
[12:45.34]Stunning.
[12:51.74]Okay, we have like a nickel of his health bar gone.
[12:56.69]We're measuring in US currency.
[13:02.80]My move is supposed to stun people.
[13:04.72]I guess it doesn't on bosses.
[13:15.65]Well, let's just get his shield.
[13:16.62]I want to see what happens.
[13:17.24]What if we get his shield down and he's like... We do like 40% of his HP in one hit.
[13:22.26]Maybe.
[13:23.24]Possible.
[13:28.33]What am I doing?
[13:33.45]What am I doing?
[13:34.32]You learned it into me.
[13:35.30]I don't know.
[13:41.29]Alright, shield's down.
[13:42.23]Incoming.
[13:44.25]Smoke his ass.
[13:52.00]Alright, we're good.
[13:55.62]But think about the loot we'll get if we beat this guy.
[13:58.65]I'm thinking about it.
[14:00.49]I mean, the block's almost over.
[14:09.77]I'm gonna die
[14:15.61]Dude, sick heals you just did right there.
[14:17.90]I would have been dead.
[14:19.17]Alright, here we go.
[14:19.65]Ready?
[14:20.88]Let's see.
[14:24.81]There he goes.
[14:26.44]What?
[14:27.22]Get him.
[14:28.61]I died.
[14:29.03]Oh, you're dead.
[14:29.74]How are you dead?
[14:30.40]I think the tornado hit me.
[14:35.62]There's no way we're gonna beat this guy.
[14:37.57]I thought it was gonna be like a, okay.
[14:39.36]We need five people.
[14:41.01]Do you want us to get five people and just kick his ass?
[14:43.99]We could.
[14:44.86]Or we could do whatever.
[14:47.03]What do you mean he sucks at this game?
[14:48.49]I'm the one that's alive.
[14:50.00]What are you talking about?
[14:53.46]Oh yeah, wait till you see the DPS charts at the end.
[14:55.67]This is a 100 person revive.
[15:00.14]Wait, I can get you?
[15:02.56]How do I get you?
[15:03.34]Don't.
[15:03.76]But don't.
[15:04.26]Like, just end it.
[15:05.25]Alright, so we need five people.
[15:08.92]I want to kill that guy.
[15:12.50]We should kill this guy.
[15:17.02]Roll match confirmed.
[15:18.21]I'm DPS.
[15:25.32]We're gonna get three fucking experts, dude.
[15:27.07]It's gonna be sick.
[15:30.50]Level 700... Dude, we got a level 60 in here?
[15:38.89]Are they gonna just destroy it?
[15:45.38]Time to get carried.
[15:46.56]I'm curious how this works.
[15:56.10]Alright, are we ready?
[15:59.95]Alright.
[16:01.26]Tank, get aggro.
[16:03.68]Nice, nice.
[16:04.12]Back, back, back.
[16:04.64]Back it up, back it up, back it up.
[16:07.56]Alright, guys, we're good.
[16:08.86]We're man intent stamina.
[16:10.01]Parrying, parrying.
[16:15.59]Healer, can you please get your heals in order?
[16:17.74]I'm healing.
[16:18.19]I'm healing.
[16:20.60]Everyone's full health?
[16:26.58]Switching to switching sword?
[16:39.34]It actually is on me.
[16:46.95]Yeah, we're actually gonna get some pretty good loot from this, I think.
[17:00.04]Do you think he has a phase two?
[17:01.35]He already entered it when the arena became a whirlwind.
[17:07.99]Uh, did we just get like epic loot now?
[17:11.79]Best in the game.
[17:12.77]The whole game?
[17:16.54]best in the entire game he needs to iron those pants so what did we get what do I get for that
[17:27.34]Well, how come we're the only people that are ugly?
[17:29.92]What is going on?
[17:31.08]Hey, wait!
[17:31.35]No, my character's beautiful!
[17:32.59]It's you!
[17:36.05]Most damage?
[17:36.96]Most damage?
[17:37.38]Wait, I didn't get any accolades?
[17:41.59]No, I didn't want to send a friend request.
[17:43.77]How do I remove that?
[17:45.24]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[17:46.34]Oh, what the fuck?
[17:47.91]Alright, well, here, I'll give you a like.
[17:55.81]Okay, is that awkward that if that guy accepts it and I immediately remove him?
[18:01.89]Is that bad?
[18:03.12]If he accepts it, message him and say, sorry, I didn't mean it.
[18:09.76]Cool.
[18:10.13]Alright.
[18:13.16]I think we just leave.
[18:14.71]That was nice.
[18:16.01]That was a shitload of money.
[18:17.70]I think you can open all the chests we just got in your inventory.
[18:26.95]unclear.
[18:31.14]Ooh, hold on a second.
[18:33.41]Wait, there's a chance to get these.
[18:35.16]I need that mask.
[18:36.53]The one in the middle, bottom.
[18:39.33]These weapons that came out of this are three times better than the ones I had.
[18:46.60]Which one do I open?
[18:49.19]Oh, umbrella.
[18:49.97]I want either.
[18:51.84]I think you just click max and it opens them all.
[18:57.20]Contains a random tier 16 rare or epic piece from a specified set.
[19:03.45]This one's recommended.
[19:05.68]Oh, shit.
[19:06.18]Come on.
[19:16.76]Dude, loot get.
[19:17.86]I got three umbrellas.
[19:19.17]I don't want umbrellas.
[19:23.85]What else is in here?
[19:25.70]Jerma after Christmas.
[19:29.07]Okay, cool.
[19:32.20]It can be used for inner way breakthrough or, oh yeah, by the way, I don't know if you've realized this, but when you're in solo campaign,
[19:37.75]You have to do like a mini dungeon to test your character to see if they can keep going.
[19:43.27]Did you do that yet?
[19:45.64]I don't think so.
[19:48.47]Because otherwise you're gonna be capped out Alright, cool.
[19:51.74]So now I did do one of those.
[19:53.01]Yeah, I remember it saying that my character cap went open At the top right there is an exit button
[19:58.75]Oh, wait, okay.
[20:01.87]I see.
[20:04.23]Cool.
[20:09.26]He has your friend in our party now?
[20:10.59]I don't know.
[20:12.14]I think this person's in the party.
[20:15.30]Says they're in solo world.
[20:16.30]This is going to be so sad, and I apologize to the person for this, but I didn't know.
[20:20.18]Where's my friends list?
[20:24.14]uh if you see them on the bottom left you hold ctrl and I think you can click on their name to do something
[20:30.67]Wait, hold on.
[20:31.10]I think I got it.
[20:31.94]Because I'm the team leader.
[20:32.86]We're good.
[20:33.67]I banished him to the nether world.
[20:35.56]Antisocial.
[20:36.14]He's never getting out.
[20:39.04]Oh, here it is.
[20:39.71]Oh, this is... Oh, man.
[20:42.82]I got you.
[20:49.47]I got you, we're good.
[20:50.88]But...
[20:52.33]I think I just sent him.
[20:53.71]I have to wait till he replies.
[20:55.14]Alright, anyways.
[20:59.47]That's fucked up.
[21:00.24]Hey, it's okay.
[21:03.75]Alright, let's go find something.
[21:05.10]I want to do, uh... Let's go do like a quest.
[21:10.48]You want to go explore the world somewhere?
[21:14.25]We could, or I think as the leader, maybe I can track a quest for us.
[21:18.33]Yeah, let's go do something.
[21:19.29]Something random.
[21:25.05]He's not gonna reply.
[21:28.88]What if he declined my friendship because he's like, I don't know, this guy's one of those big chin guys?
[21:33.90]Nah.
[21:36.59]I will say if there's a big chin modifier in a video game I'm going to be doing it.
[21:41.00]And I feel like a lot of people are the same way.
[21:44.33]And I feel like that's kind of a barometer for people, like a very first impression of, oh, you're one of those big chin character creator guys.
[21:50.94]Either that's yay or nay, right?
[22:04.47]Yeah, there's a lot of stuff in Kaifeng to do.
[22:06.21]There's quite a few of these that say need to enter solo mode to do.
[22:12.13]Do you, I wonder if we get access to Kai Feng soon here.
[22:24.24]Let me go.
[22:25.07]We can do this thing too.
[22:25.79]This looks like there's a handful of little missions to do.
[22:28.12]This one's combat.
[22:31.21]This one says multiplayer campaign.
[22:33.30]Two of these are multiplayer campaigns.
[22:34.73]I think they're sword trials.
[22:37.78]I think they're just like bosses.
[22:44.70]We might need to go in the solo campaign for a minute or two.
[22:47.91]I accepted a quest.
[22:49.78]Oh, cool.
[22:50.58]What?
[22:52.11]Who was this?
[22:54.38]Oh, you're seeing the horse guy?
[22:55.57]Yeah, this guy, what's this guy doing?
[22:57.74]This guy has you by like a string.
[23:07.22]What am I doing?
[23:08.33]Wait, what is he doing to you?
[23:11.17]Where do you feel discomfort or something unusual?
[23:14.13]Oh, he came to heal me.
[23:16.14]I think I requested a healer the last time I played solo.
[23:19.88]And he's healing me.
[23:20.80]My organs hurt.
[23:22.11]Oh, that's a huge...
[23:22.97]Doctor, my organs are in terrible pain.
[23:24.60]You sent out like a carrier pigeon to say, hey, somebody please heal me.
[23:28.94]And this guy accepted it and he's here now.
[23:32.42]What about me?
[23:35.80]Apply.
[23:38.19]Do I have to apply to get healed too?
[23:41.08]yeah when you're injured there's like request a healer and someone like a player actually has to come here do it
[23:48.13]This master of healing.
[23:53.82]Treatment begins.
[23:55.81]You have to go through a whole treatment?
[23:59.54]I'm telling him my symptoms, and then he's waving them away and dealing damage to them.
[24:06.95]That's funny.
[24:07.65]I love that.
[24:09.78]So could you just be the guy that just kind of hangs out and just looks for people to cleanse them?
[24:14.77]The master horse.
[24:17.78]What does he say now?
[24:18.62]Thank you so much.
[24:20.03]Does he do anything?
[24:20.72]Look at him.
[24:21.72]He's got this thing of herbs.
[24:26.45]Okay, is it like an hourly rate or something?
[24:29.09]Does he stay with you?
[24:30.15]Did you have to pay him?
[24:30.77]I gave him five likes.
[24:33.71]Did you pay him?
[24:35.13]No, I just gave him five likes on Yelp.
[24:37.96]Oh.
[24:39.75]He's bowing.
[24:42.79]What do I do?
[24:44.76]I'll send him a gift.
[24:46.10]Here, I'll give you a...
[24:47.45]I'll give you a... Am I about to gift this guy a bunch of fucking my money?
[24:53.06]Gift him...
[24:53.61]I'm petting him.
[24:54.63]Here, how about hollow... How about this one?
[24:58.21]Oh, I have to buy it.
[24:59.57]I don't have that.
[25:01.82]Here, give this to someone to gain 10 popularity points.
[25:05.40]Alright, let's give it to them.
[25:07.69]Oh, I don't have any money.
[25:09.37]Sorry, I don't have any money, but it was really nice of you to come over and do that.
[25:14.39]Okay, now let me find a quest we can do.
[25:16.44]Now that I've been healed of my ailments.
[25:19.28]That's so funny.
[25:22.07]You're gonna buy a microtransaction for a healer horse.
[25:26.96]I think that was the quest I actually started, was asking for a healer horse.
[25:29.79]Really?
[25:36.10]Okay, you hear Chef Zubawan loudly arguing with a guest.
[25:41.05]Okay, let's go do it.
[25:41.75]Approach and find the reason.
[25:44.56]Where is it on the map?
[25:48.68]You want to mark it on the map?
[25:52.01]Hold on.
[25:53.54]There's multiplayer events all in here.
[25:55.75]Blessed Land, Five Animal Frolics.
[25:58.02]There's like funny little things we can do.
[25:59.27]You can recommend them.
[26:01.23]How about...
[26:03.58]Five Animal Frolics, a traditional health exercise created...
[26:06.47]Wait, we got to do the health exercise, dude.
[26:09.58]Yeah.
[26:10.58]You see it in the city?
[26:11.85]We're going to do the health exercise.
[26:13.88]Five animal frolics, multiplayer event.
[26:19.97]Oh, I see the multiplayer campaign Void King.
[26:22.42]Oh, that's what we just did.
[26:23.38]We just did that one.
[26:25.13]Let's do this one first.
[26:26.46]Let's see what this is.
[26:31.38]It's yoga time.
[26:32.56]Is that what this is?
[26:44.76]Did you see it on the map?
[26:48.46]No, but I came to you.
[26:50.67]I trust you.
[26:52.19]Good.
[26:53.82]And then if you want after this, we could break into solo to progress.
[26:56.97]Maybe we can get to Kaifeng.
[26:59.04]I think there's a lot of shit to do in Kaifeng.
[27:04.33]Okay, Pepsi Nan is here.
[27:07.59]Okay, there's two of us in here that are going to do the...
[27:10.87]Wait for me.
[27:13.72]I'm coming.
[27:22.73]Alright, you ready?
[27:23.84]Let's do it.
[27:24.68]Do we have to all start it together?
[27:25.83]Ready.
[27:31.13]Okay, I thought it just said 0 out of 300 people are signing up for this.
[27:35.23]Turn left.
[27:38.56]Center.
[27:39.16]How do I do it?
[27:40.28]You have to be doing this in real life to follow along.
[27:47.16]Ape lift?
[27:50.25]Oh, is this person doing it?
[27:51.40]Yeah, this person's gonna do it too.
[27:53.95]Press down.
[27:56.74]Step back.
[28:00.82]Why are they not participating?
[28:05.79]Is that the Joker behind us?
[28:10.79]Oh, here we go.
[28:11.31]We got three of us.
[28:16.35]So majestic.
[28:19.18]Did we get experience for this?
[28:23.31]pluck fruit.
[28:30.39]I want more people to come over here.
[28:32.20]This apparently cures you from hysteria.
[28:36.16]Right now, there's like a handful of people watching this stream that are like,
[28:39.17]I gotta get the fuck over in that circle!
[28:41.16]They need to see my crazy character, please!
[28:43.58]Stay in the circle!
[28:47.68]Somebody just literally did like turbo mode on their horse to get over here as fast as they could.
[28:55.36]And they're going to get right into the camera and they're going to have a goofy face.
[28:57.75]And it's going to be, look what I did.
[28:59.30]I took the eye slider and I moved it as far away as I could.
[29:04.37]Just like you did.
[29:05.41]What the hell?
[29:06.50]What's going on?
[29:06.93]I messed it up!
[29:07.49]I don't know what I did wrong!
[29:08.20]What's wrong with you?
[29:10.86]I'm doing- I'm good!
[29:11.71]I'm a chicken!
[29:12.65]I'm good, man!
[29:13.50]Look at me!
[29:14.88]I locked it in.
[29:16.97]Uhh...
[29:19.13]C-cure me with your dance.
[29:21.72]Are you a fucking turkey?
[29:23.23]What are you?
[29:24.56]Hold X.
[29:27.38]Oh, I went the wrong way.
[29:29.15]Oh, no.
[29:29.87]I went the wrong way.
[29:36.60]I think it's okay, though.
[29:40.11]Can you just be a chicken the whole time now?
[29:41.89]I think I need to watch you to...
[29:44.85]This is the hysteria I'm being cured of.
[29:49.25]I hope you are a chicken for the rest of the day.
[29:51.90]no that would be so good for me that would be good for me I no nobody helped I need to call healing you got to call the horse guy doctor
[30:05.40]Please tell me you're gonna be like this for the rest of the day.
[30:08.27]I didn't know meditation was so dangerous.
[30:16.51]Alright, am I...
[30:17.55]I got...
[30:17.85]I'm almost there.
[30:20.36]I'm so relaxed right now.
[30:21.67]You're walking around as a bird.
[30:23.27]we are uh we are forest gumping and everyone's just from all over the country showing up
[30:35.56]What do you have access to as the bird?
[30:38.87]Nothing.
[30:40.29]Every time I press a button, it says you're suffering from hysteria and you cannot do this.
[30:45.94]Seek medical help from a healer as soon as possible.
[30:51.12]You actually might be stuck like that forever.
[30:53.63]I'm not going to help you.
[30:54.56]Nobody help him.
[30:55.36]I don't care who's watching.
[30:57.85]Uh, I have a timer.
[30:59.68]It's one more minute.
[31:00.91]Oh, good.
[31:03.32]Uh-oh, this person... Don't mess up your meditation!
[31:06.42]What did you do when it showed the constellations on your screen?
[31:09.25]I mean, I messed it up big time.
[31:12.57]Oh, I tried to move it once and I became a bird.
[31:19.06]Alright, I'm at almost at 300 points.
[31:25.46]I like this person that became a deer.
[31:30.66]Would you rather be a deer or a chicken?
[31:32.90]I can't even look at the map as a chicken.
[31:42.01]Bird is bis?
[31:44.91]Bird would be actually kind of... Oh, okay.
[31:46.79]Well, what kind of bird?
[31:49.20]I think like a predator bird would be fine.
[31:54.92]Alright, I'm almost maxed out.
[31:57.80]I want to be a turkey.
[32:00.68]No, duck.
[32:01.50]What am I talking about?
[32:04.47]Alright, here we go.
[32:08.27]deer run sit back am I gonna be a deer wait event complete you did it dude it's got five thousand coins you you just actually hard carried the group
[32:18.11]Did I really?
[32:19.82]What about this guy?
[32:21.97]This guy's still a deer.
[32:25.61]Okay, cool.
[32:32.28]There's also Blessed Land.
[32:37.57]There's like a health club.
[32:44.82]We have to know classic.
[32:46.11]I think that's like a trivia game.
[32:49.02]What is this one?
[32:51.28]You've been mischievous and now find yourself behind bars.
[32:55.17]Wait, we can do this too.
[33:00.09]parade list?
[33:01.34]These are all the people that... Oh, this is what you saw before.
[33:06.63]We can go to the prison, man.
[33:07.92]Just watch people get arrested.
[33:12.90]Visit the prison.
[33:16.75]I'm trying to find missions.
[33:26.89]Wait, did I just...
[33:27.47]I think I just joined this person's instance.
[33:32.81]Are they just in the jail cell?
[33:51.92]Hold on, there they are.
[33:53.28]Alright, so this is what you were doing before.
[34:02.41]The prison cart is too close to throw things at it.
[34:07.31]Do you get, like, bad karma for doing this?
[34:35.23]Do they?
[34:35.70]Okay.
[34:36.97]Okay.
[34:37.09]For those that have been arrested before.
[34:40.61]Go ahead.
[34:40.89]Sorry.
[34:41.90]I went to solo mode and apparently it's not solo.
[34:44.61]I can invite you to my solo game and we can do quests.
[34:47.28]Cool.
[34:49.55]I actually did want to see a lot of this random online stuff though.
[34:58.76]They're getting time off their sentence for doing this.
[35:00.83]Okay, those of you that are gonna- I've never been arrested in this game.
[35:03.73]Do you actually have to sit in prison?
[35:08.11]for in-game hours or in-game time?
[35:10.41]Yes, you do.
[35:11.48]How long do you have to do that for?
[35:22.01]Your character is stuck for IRL hours.
[35:30.65]What do you do to- Okay, what did this person do to get put into this cage?
[35:35.69]Dude, last stream I was running around hitting random NPCs.
[35:38.71]This person must have done something horrible.
[35:41.77]Are you in solo mode?
[35:43.98]I think I have to get you in here.
[35:45.33]Yeah, let me get it.
[35:47.56]I'm in somebody else's instance.
[35:48.83]Yeah, there we go.
[35:50.40]Alright.
[35:50.66]It still says we're in the same team.
[35:52.92]Uh, solo world?
[35:53.95]It says you're in your solo...
[35:54.77]I mean, we're in the same team, but you're in a solo world.
[35:58.44]What happens if I go to solo mode?
[36:05.36]Solo slash co-op mode not connected.
[36:08.69]My word.
[36:09.26]Okay, there we go.
[36:10.04]I think we can do that.
[36:12.79]I invited you to co-op.
[36:14.49]Hey, look at that.
[36:16.33]Nice.
[36:20.03]Hey, look at you.
[36:21.35]Now we're in our own world.
[36:24.88]Join me.
[36:25.79]I join you.
[36:30.00]Check out this secret run technique.
[36:32.51]Actually pretty cool.
[36:37.15]What did you just do?
[36:39.69]That's how this looks when you speed up the run.
[36:47.11]Yeah, again, the game's available on Steam.
[36:50.51]It's on everything.
[36:52.62]Uh, Epic Games, PlayStation Store, and mobile.
[36:55.53]Which is what excited me the most.
[36:59.98]Where winds meet.
[37:01.75]Free to play.
[37:04.68]And there is no pay to win in the game.
[37:07.38]The devs are adhering to a no pay to win principle.
[37:13.34]Got him.
[37:23.14]This is our quest, I believe.
[37:25.14]Cool.
[37:25.95]Did you get the... stone?
[37:32.81]Cat.
[37:43.26]What?
[37:45.80]Did I speed up your cutscene or are you in a different one?
[37:48.31]I was petting a cat.
[37:52.40]I went to a cutscene the moment I walked in here.
[37:54.17]I think it's because it's your game, technically.
[37:57.14]It's your cutscene.
[37:58.56]Kind of like last time.
[38:00.79]Ah, yeah.
[38:02.71]I can make you party leader.
[38:04.97]Um, sure.
[38:06.60]Why not?
[38:08.84]Will we be on the same quest?
[38:09.98]We're in Ster, Ster, Ster World.
[38:12.92]Is that the name of your world or is that your character's name?
[38:16.11]It's my character's name.
[38:17.71]Why is it Ster Ster Ster world?
[38:22.21]I don't know.
[38:22.95]Because it's my world.
[38:27.54]Alright.
[38:29.22]We're investigating the porcelain kiln.
[38:33.28]You got it.
[38:36.07]Something happened here.
[38:40.38]Oh, actually, I did do this.
[38:42.95]Oh, you did?
[38:43.52]Yeah, because I thought you got this far.
[38:46.93]Oh, I think I didn't do a side quest.
[38:49.92]You should join my campaign because I'm at a point where I think we're about to be a major, major thing is happening.
[38:55.35]To go to like another area.
[38:59.20]So let's do that.
[39:01.44]I'm leaving your world, man.
[39:06.11]I'm just trying to be helpful.
[39:13.84]How do I get to my own world?
[39:18.25]It says I'm connected to your world.
[39:20.62]Oh, there we go.
[39:20.98]Leave call.
[39:24.70]Yeah, we should do mine.
[39:32.88]I got coins for that.
[39:37.32]Okay.
[39:38.85]Back to my own mode.
[39:44.11]Uh, my world.
[39:48.64]I believe if you hold control and right click my name on the bottom, you can invite
[39:53.13]I'm not sure because we were already like...
[39:58.76]Okay, so I'm back in my world.
[40:00.23]Now I can go to here, right?
[40:06.58]And then solo co-op mode, right?
[40:10.65]Are you requesting co-op or are you, so you're one of the- I requested to join you.
[40:17.36]Hey, look at that.
[40:18.06]Alright, so now...
[40:19.97]If we go... Yeah, enemy lair.
[40:25.64]Co-op unavailable for this stage.
[40:27.41]Oh, unfortunate.
[40:28.81]Okay, what about this one?
[40:33.39]There's something here, too.
[40:35.80]Oh, right.
[40:36.84]Let's see if we can do this.
[40:46.48]If you come to me, I think we can fight this, maybe?
[40:49.69]I think I did already kill this, though.
[40:56.10]Ah, so we can't do that.
[40:58.80]Co-op unavailable for this stage.
[41:00.10]Did it say it was unavailable for that stage for you too?
[41:03.68]For which stage?
[41:04.38]The one I was doing before?
[41:05.19]The one that you were doing before.
[41:07.00]I don't think so.
[41:07.80]We were doing it.
[41:10.22]Hmm.
[41:14.73]We could go here too.
[41:15.52]Let's go here.
[41:18.79]You can just do it again.
[41:21.07]Can we do it again?
[41:21.95]Oh, I want to start fresh.
[41:24.84]Sure.
[41:25.45]Disguise?
[41:26.23]Is that what we do?
[41:27.62]Oh, no, no, no.
[41:28.43]I don't want to redo that.
[41:35.14]Can I still track it if it's listed here?
[41:38.85]I can teleport to it, but it teleports me here.
[41:43.34]Is this technically the...
[41:49.53]Because I think it was back that way.
[41:51.52]Let's go to that comp.
[41:52.20]I think we have to do some stuff out in the world.
[41:54.46]Because some of the stuff, I don't think we can progress unless I'm in my own game.
[42:00.80]So let's just go.
[42:02.03]You go ahead and teleport.
[42:05.22]Teleport to me.
[42:05.87]It's on the table.
[42:08.82]Was it the... Oh, it was the thing on the table.
[42:12.41]The mysterious book, yeah.
[42:14.10]Yeah.
[42:14.70]Is right here.
[42:16.15]I thought it was like a teleport to like the boss door or something.
[42:20.65]I will come back.
[42:32.07]It's just to redo the boss for the same loot.
[42:33.86]Well, Ster hasn't seen it.
[42:36.22]Oh, here we go.
[42:37.17]Alright.
[42:41.06]Are you ready to fight a boss?
[42:44.41]Can you be drunk in this game?
[42:46.15]Yeah.
[42:46.53]Yeah.
[42:46.75]When it says co-op unavailable, that means that I can't interact with stuff, but I believe we can still do it all together.
[42:54.00]Okay.
[42:54.48]Alright, uh, you coming into me?
[42:57.41]Uh, I'm in like a...
[43:01.37]Exploding world?
[43:02.59]Where are you?
[43:03.70]I'm in the exploding world too.
[43:05.85]Oh, I see.
[43:06.30]You're like walking over here.
[43:12.62]So you can just kind of redo this stuff to go for loot then.
[43:15.84]Alright, I get it.
[43:18.76]I don't think I can enter.
[43:21.28]You watch me closely.
[43:28.32]I don't have any heals either.
[43:33.51]Can you get in?
[43:37.54]No.
[43:38.93]Alright, well I have to really lock in here.
[43:45.95]Alright.
[43:47.20]No, I don't want to leave co-op.
[43:48.48]Shit.
[43:49.73]I didn't have any heals.
[43:50.85]I have to sit down at one of those things.
[43:53.12]I can spectate you.
[43:58.00]Just be dead.
[43:59.62]I mean, I am dead.
[44:02.31]She wants to kill you so bad.
[44:04.70]Dude, you put up such a crazy force field!
[44:07.11]Whoa!
[44:09.22]Aha!
[44:09.68]I teleported to you!
[44:11.69]Alright, now kill her and revive me!
[44:15.35]Nice!
[44:18.47]That's it.
[44:23.18]That's it.
[44:30.01]Big heels.
[44:36.58]Dude, what happened?
[44:37.98]You're getting hit by everything.
[44:39.07]She grabbed you with the scythe.
[44:41.60]Shit.
[44:42.50]You down again?
[44:43.11]Yes.
[44:49.55]How do you get these revives, man?
[44:51.16]They're crazy.
[44:52.43]Run out, run out, run out, run out, run out.
[44:53.62]The fan lets me do it.
[44:54.80]I think you have to run out of that.
[45:00.40]Bro, try not to get hit challenge.
[45:03.66]I'm sorry.
[45:05.61]I'm using a wrong weapon.
[45:06.56]I want to use the spear.
[45:10.95]to get hit in challenge.
[45:12.60]I didn't have any of my heals when I came in here.
[45:20.59]She's level 25.
[45:21.59]I know.
[45:22.25]We have to actually try to do this hard.
[45:27.18]Alright.
[45:27.62]I'll focus, I guess.
[45:29.17]We might have to restart it, because now we can do it together.
[45:32.74]Yeah, let's just...
[45:33.41]I don't have any heals.
[45:33.99]Let's just restart.
[45:35.74]Okay, let her.
[45:36.32]At least he was good at yoga.
[45:39.56]I need my heals back.
[45:41.91]You were crazy at the yoga minigame.
[45:46.86]I'm trying to die and I'm... How did you do this twice?
[45:51.37]It's because I died!
[45:53.47]No, alright, well we're back, we're back, we're back.
[45:55.20]I don't have- where are my heals?
[45:56.60]I have zero of my...
[45:59.09]I don't know, I have two.
[46:01.12]Why is it not giving me my flasks?
[46:03.57]Wait, do I?
[46:04.05]Okay.
[46:10.83]Do I have to craft them back?
[46:16.64]Well, you're a healer.
[46:17.29]We're fine.
[46:19.80]Good.
[46:26.75]Yeah, I just have like generic healing I can do to you all the time now as well.
[46:30.40]Good.
[46:32.11]That's helpful.
[46:51.86]Good stun.
[46:52.75]Stun.
[47:00.25]She definitely has.
[47:01.00]She has two phases.
[47:10.78]Shit, I didn't want to get hit by that.
[47:16.67]Alright, and do it now.
[47:22.25]Alright, phase two coming up.
[47:25.04]Alright, run away, run away.
[47:28.77]Stay away from the center.
[47:31.11]I love that it explains boss mechanics.
[47:33.08]I've played too many games where you're like, I don't... What was I supposed to do?
[47:38.35]I think we'd still get hit by it no matter what.
[47:44.65]Are you full health?
[47:45.86]I'm full health.
[47:48.24]But it's scary.
[48:02.52]You think you can take on the likes of Ster, Ster, Ster and Mezz Memorize?
[48:12.69]she's oh my god she's getting me I don't know what's hitting me I might die
[48:22.95]You dead?
[48:25.10]Yeah.
[48:26.03]Oh, dude!
[48:26.75]I didn't use the mask at all.
[48:27.99]I tried to.
[48:28.56]I couldn't see through the flames.
[48:37.99]How does he get hit by everything?
[48:44.35]Oh, it's time for the Jerma carry!
[48:48.44]Oh, fuck.
[48:48.64]I mean, you said you beat this already.
[48:51.40]I did.
[48:52.89]So you should know what's going on.
[48:55.26]But I have no heals!
[48:59.02]Why not?
[49:00.08]I don't...
[49:01.87]I don't know.
[49:02.33]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[49:05.04]How do I get my heals back?
[49:14.03]Where are they?
[49:15.79]Okay, did you get yours back right there?
[49:18.42]Yeah.
[49:22.40]I might have heals in the bag.
[49:24.11]As long as I don't go down first, we're good.
[49:25.75]I'm just, I'll be better.
[49:27.32]I need to, I think I didn't rest before we activated it.
[49:29.63]We can like reactivate everything.
[49:31.53]Now we know how it works.
[49:33.47]But we're not going to need to because I don't even need heals.
[49:38.77]Thank you for watching
[49:49.57]Just completely lock in.
[49:50.97]I'm not talking anymore.
[50:02.03]Did she fight you for a sec?
[50:03.78]I don't know.
[50:04.29]She really does not like you.
[50:12.42]Excellent.
[50:13.18]Excellent already.
[50:24.13]Excellent already.
[50:25.04]Flawless.
[50:51.45]I missed it.
[50:52.32]I don't know what I did.
[50:55.50]Gotta block those man.
[51:02.15]I pressed the wrong button.
[51:03.20]Whoops.
[51:05.86]Alright, run.
[51:10.96]I think you get behind these tombstones I'm behind
[51:20.09]Alright.
[51:22.29]Here we go.
[51:31.36]Big parries!
[51:47.34]Oh my god.
[51:48.41]That was insane.
[51:50.42]That did a lot of damage.
[51:51.79]That did an unbelievable amount of damage.
[51:57.62]Thank you.
[51:59.79]You doing the center thing again?
[52:02.01]Yep.
[52:02.11]Are you full health when you get up?
[52:03.38]I am not.
[52:05.96]Okay, I'll do healing circle.
[52:09.01]Usually it lets me see your health, but I can't.
[52:13.93]I'm doing alright now.
[52:15.62]I'm at like 70%.
[52:17.72]Yeah, this heals a ton now that I have upgraded weapons.
[52:33.90]Oh, go, go, go, go, go.
[52:40.48]Alright, we're good.
[52:41.46]We'll get it this time.
[52:46.34]Just don't do anything stupid.
[52:49.24]Did you do something stupid?
[53:01.59]Dude, that was such a huge stun.
[53:03.36]You have no idea.
[53:11.63]Watch out watch out watch out!
[53:19.51]I've been exhausted.
[53:23.05]Oh, no.
[53:24.05]I pressed the wrong button.
[53:27.11]Jeez.
[53:28.21]I'll burn you.
[53:35.44]Alright, she's pretty much dead.
[53:42.49]We did it.
[53:43.18]Triumphant!
[53:45.45]Excellent work.
[53:47.78]Oh, dude, with literally no heals from anything at all.
[53:50.45]Dude, and we're gonna like... Oh, it's gonna be like...
[53:53.52]Equipped healing food depleted.
[53:55.26]Oh.
[53:56.02]I don't know what that means.
[54:02.90]And what do we get?
[54:06.12]Wait, I can claim one?
[54:07.02]Couple fish.
[54:08.37]I want that sword.
[54:11.76]That sword's kind of crazy, right?
[54:17.07]Oh, it's a chance to get it.
[54:20.25]a big sword looked really cool I switched I got the double swords and they're fun I got a new pair of gloves
[54:33.82]18 mastery.
[54:35.34]Max HP.
[54:37.39]Oh, it's a part of a set.
[54:40.48]I did get some good other stuff too, though.
[54:42.51]Here it is.
[54:46.00]7 to 16, it's a lot better.
[54:49.92]You can upgrade your weapons too, remember?
[54:59.30]True.
[55:05.20]Cool.
[55:05.59]Alright.
[55:06.57]Well, that works.
[55:07.12]And I think we can do that as many times as we want, probably.
[55:10.99]It looks like a lot of the bosses you get first clear bonuses for maybe dailies or weeklies or something.
[55:20.47]Okay.
[55:21.58]Go like this.
[55:24.55]Exit.
[55:24.79]It's the first time I'm on stream.
[55:29.01]I've never gotten a hi from you.
[55:31.71]Well, this is the first time you've ever been here.
[55:36.54]Hey dude, the first time I've ever been here in my whole life.
[55:38.51]How come you've never said hi before?
[55:40.03]Because you just got here for the first time ever.
[55:41.76]You're saying hi now.
[55:43.05]I just did.
[55:44.01]I have a perfect record with saying hi to you.
[55:48.20]That is true.
[55:48.82]There's a 100% high rating.
[55:54.11]Jerm is 100% high right now.
[55:58.16]Alright, that's cool.
[55:59.42]Alright, so now what you're saying is we can go to the campaign and you just won't see the cutscene.
[56:09.36]So if you teleport to me,
[56:13.82]Read an analog clock right now.
[56:16.39]8... What time is it?
[56:18.48]1.54 p.m.
[56:27.35]Good?
[56:31.14]Why are you yelling the time at me?
[56:36.22]Teleport to me.
[56:40.45]Hold on, I was just upgrading my weapons.
[56:43.13]I was thinking about doing that too.
[56:48.11]It was very easy to get them to our current level.
[56:56.43]you like the game uh take away the fact that this is a sponsored segment of the stream
[57:02.26]Actually do I this is gonna become an iPad game for me like I'm gonna be playing it all the time I already played it a little bit with this character off stream and
[57:11.51]But this is an iPad game for me.
[57:18.08]I don't think I can join you with what you're doing.
[57:20.75]You cannot.
[57:23.21]See if you can in a minute.
[57:25.30]Player's playing the main story quest and I can't join.
[57:28.32]Huh.
[57:31.21]And I think the new region you were talking about, I saw the quest that was around level 34.
[57:37.48]So we've got a little bit of a ways to go.
[57:43.84]I wonder if I actually activate this, if you can do the fight that's in here, maybe.
[57:47.63]Let's see.
[57:52.72]I think when I was playing, I just have not done like any of the main quest.
[57:56.20]Probably.
[57:56.54]How do I go up from here?
[58:07.54]I guess I kind of teleported to a weird spot, didn't I?
[58:13.12]Okay, yeah, yeah, they've been tricked by the horse tamer.
[58:17.70]being told that yes we can co-op the fights but I don't think I can do whatever you were doing
[58:26.17]A lot of Elpers in chat.
[58:28.52]Hey, I'm happy to have Elpers, honestly.
[58:31.81]I'm pro-Elper.
[58:34.08]This might be not a place I want to go.
[58:35.87]Or this one here.
[58:39.45]Or this one, maybe?
[58:46.21]I need to heal.
[58:47.95]Yeah, I need to sit down at a thing.
[58:52.49]standing this whole time.
[58:54.20]How do I sit down at this?
[58:56.90]Can't you sit at these to refresh?
[59:06.57]I like never use the actual flask because I have the healing.
[59:09.29]Need to craft more healing potions.
[59:14.89]So you didn't have to do this.
[59:16.42]Yeah, because I haven't used very many.
[59:23.76]Enhancing gear?
[59:27.56]What about this soup?
[59:29.67]Bowls?
[59:30.99]Here's a food.
[59:31.47]I need meat.
[59:35.07]Oh, I can eat this raw.
[59:40.35]Craft.
[59:44.10]Brew medicine.
[59:46.11]You actually have to craft the medicine!
[59:50.71]They are not messing around in this game.
[59:52.24]You have to make your heals.
[59:55.58]You don't just sit down and go, you get two of them back.
[60:00.13]Well, maybe you shouldn't use so many of them.
[60:03.08]I know.
[60:03.54]Well, they are not messing around.
[60:11.01]Alright, I gotta get up there.
[60:23.52]Can I, like, climb this?
[60:28.53]I just got ore. Watch this shit.
[60:38.05]On these?
[60:39.65]Seriously, this is going to be sick if I can do this.
[60:43.75]I need to... No, no, no.
[60:44.79]Get off, get off, get off.
[60:45.40]Watch this.
[60:56.54]Oh my god, yeah!
[60:58.25]Yeah!
[60:59.25]Yeah!
[61:01.54]Put the toast on it!
[61:06.97]Hey, dropping in.
[61:10.97]Mercy, please spare me.
[61:15.62]Mercy.
[61:17.87]Mercy, please spare me.
[61:20.98]May I please join you, Senpai?
[61:23.28]I'm in a cutscene, maybe right after you can.
[61:30.70]That was pretty good.
[61:38.49]Yeah, I think I could probably do a little better than you know.
[61:46.10]Hi, this guy's getting on a horse.
[61:49.60]You don't get credit for doing it better than moving on.
[61:53.76]Yeah, that's good.
[61:54.34]But like, I'm better.
[61:55.09]Anyway, so there's like horse over here.
[61:57.93]I think I'm about to fight this guy and his horse.
[62:00.30]Alright.
[62:01.08]Ster has requested to join you.
[62:02.85]Well, get in here.
[62:03.47]I'm fighting a guy's horse.
[62:06.34]This feels wrong.
[62:10.76]Leader is in combat, cannot travel.
[62:13.76]Oh, shit.
[62:15.77]Where are you?
[62:16.41]I can just go to you, right?
[62:19.28]I'm fighting a guy's horse right now.
[62:21.87]It's a whole thing.
[62:28.73]Alright, this is a great boss fight.
[62:31.48]You have to fight a guy's horse, that's it.
[62:34.81]And he just throws some shit at you from afar.
[62:43.83]Should I... You know, focus the guy.
[62:47.16]Oh my god.
[62:50.31]Oh my god!
[62:51.44]There's fall damage.
[62:54.09]Oh my god!
[62:55.82]Maybe I shouldn't focus the little guy.
[62:59.64]I don't... No, you gotta focus the horse.
[63:08.49]But didn't do it
[63:17.31]Oh, God damn it.
[63:32.72]Can't deflect gold.
[63:40.24]Ah, I just did it out of habit.
[63:43.69]That was a mistake.
[63:45.68]I wish you could too.
[63:47.75]If you were, uh... Maybe if you were with me before?
[63:50.60]Yeah, that's...
[63:58.40]You gonna run?
[63:58.84]Oh my god, I thought it was a dash.
[64:02.26]I think I have to jump that.
[64:05.15]I don't know.
[64:09.02]Get the shit out of me!
[64:16.83]Do it!
[64:27.39]This horse's moves are crazy!
[64:46.70]I'll tell you, it's hard to deflect an animal.
[64:49.51]Because you're so used to seeing people with a sword!
[64:52.91]Like, I'm swinging!
[64:55.64]Yeah, I don't know what a horse's moves are.
[64:57.27]I don't know how to deflect a horse.
[64:59.49]When's the last time I fought a horse in a video game?
[65:04.55]Their moveset is... No, that is not an excuse.
[65:06.94]That's a valid thing.
[65:19.59]I saw a horse today.
[65:20.71]I think I did it from my cat horses.
[65:25.59]I'm used to it.
[65:27.94]I don't feel bad.
[65:32.87]My dog.
[65:44.87]Turn the volume up a little.
[65:46.17]I got you.
[65:54.40]What the... Oh!
[66:01.66]This game is fucking crazy.
[66:10.06]That was very crazy.
[66:15.56]No, it's going to be a phase two.
[66:17.13]I need you for this, dude.
[66:17.97]I actually do.
[66:20.10]Well, I wish I could see.
[66:21.43]Oh, my God.
[66:23.76]You didn't want me before.
[66:28.30]I'm going to have to restart it anyways, so you can help me.
[66:31.73]Oh, shit.
[66:35.14]Oh, this is not going to go well.
[66:37.05]Guys, this ain't going to go well.
[66:46.85]Thank you for watching!
[67:08.68]I'm dead.
[67:09.47]I'm gonna die.
[67:10.87]No, I'm not.
[67:15.97]I'm on my own adventure, I guess.
[67:20.38]I'm still kind of doing it.
[67:21.77]We can do this again too.
[67:22.54]I want you to see this.
[67:23.47]It's great.
[67:28.04]I'm out here fighting bears.
[67:53.57]Finally.
[67:54.08]Oh, I... Oh...
[68:02.80]Oh shit, he's going crazy!
[68:04.58]What's he doing?
[68:05.13]What's wrong with him?
[68:17.77]There we go.
[68:24.69]The winds get the meat, Jarmo.
[68:27.16]I think I... No, oh, I didn't do it.
[68:37.36]Oh, fuck.
[68:49.39]Okay.
[68:58.66]I wonder if there's another world boss in this zone.
[69:05.95]I don't know.
[69:12.58]Hey, are you dead or alive?
[69:15.03]Yeah, I don't know.
[69:16.50]Are you?
[69:19.01]Why do you always kick people in the face?
[69:23.74]I need to turn this up.
[69:24.58]Hold on.
[69:29.30]Know each other?
[69:33.00]I always get caught off guard that that's a guy that I am.
[69:37.81]that's the guy that you are yeah do you really know yido do not laugh this off do you have any idea you almost lost your life I can't make you listen anymore can I
[69:47.80]Hey, Han Han!
[69:59.59]I do love that you can do that.
[70:03.19]Okay.
[70:05.88]I...
[70:06.91]I think...
[70:09.01]Let me see if you can come in now.
[70:11.48]Let me see if I can do that again.
[70:12.74]Do you teleport to me right now?
[70:15.73]Let me see.
[70:18.16]I feel like I'm right before a fight.
[70:21.87]where are you?
[70:22.69]you just click on the name and teleport or the the feet icons above our names will teleport you to me
[70:33.40]It says you're in solo mode.
[70:36.79]Uh, can you do it?
[70:37.91]Does it say yes anyway?
[70:40.54]Uh, it says invite to co-op, kick from team, uh, personal info.
[70:45.56]Well, you can invite me to co-op.
[70:47.09]Wait, hold on, hold on, wait.
[70:48.43]Gather?
[70:48.80]Yeah, let me invite to co-op.
[70:58.00]Yes, I get to play with you.
[70:59.79]Hey, what's up?
[71:01.31]Yo.
[71:02.82]So I don't think we can do that.
[71:05.29]I think we have to do the specific stuff that we can do together.
[71:12.93]I think the main story campaign stuff we cannot do together.
[71:18.83]There's this mysterious colossus.
[71:21.02]Can we do that together?
[71:23.40]I think we can.
[71:25.88]You sure try.
[71:26.95]Let's do the Mysterious Colossus.
[71:31.50]You can do the Lost Chapters and World Bosses.
[71:33.77]Is there another World Boss in this zone that we didn't do?
[71:37.58]We did the Puppet Master.
[71:39.17]I see there is the Sleeping Taoist.
[71:47.19]An open world MMO, Wuxi, and yeah, please tell me this game's for me.
[71:53.25]Well, you could try it literally right now.
[71:54.98]The game's free.
[71:55.92]Free to play.

[72:00.94]It's available on every platform.
[72:02.50]It's on Steam, free to play.
[72:05.01]There's no pay to win.
[72:06.39]Just give it a try if you want to give it a try.
[72:09.28]Check the link in the panel.
[72:10.97]Or, if it's convenient for you, that link that's pinned up at the comments up there.
[72:21.72]So what were you saying is another world boss?
[72:25.07]Oh, what happens if you press P?
[72:27.18]What happens if I press P?
[72:29.89]Uh, I have... World Boss Sleeping Daoist.
[72:34.90]you want to do that one um whatever's on there I think that'll show all the co-op stuff okay cool let's do it yeah let's try this one more
[72:45.27]Uh, we're boss sleeping.
[72:46.59]I think, is it there now?
[72:53.91]know it said I could track it but it says only the host can set co-op goals
[72:59.62]Cleaning up the mess.
[73:00.64]Where would it be located?
[73:01.81]Because I have that tribe.
[73:03.84]I'm going to cancel that.
[73:07.40]And then...
[73:11.56]It's up there.
[73:12.42]Alright.
[73:13.05]We can go up there.
[73:15.07]I've tracked it.
[73:15.94]It's kind of in that, I wonder if we can just clear some of the way.
[73:18.77]It's an area we haven't seen yet.
[73:21.70]So we should just try to ride there.
[73:24.85]You guys doing anything after this?
[73:25.93]We are.
[73:26.27]We're going to be playing something else right after this.
[73:30.83]Can we do your fun run thing?
[73:34.44]Yes.
[73:40.18]Let's go!
[73:49.43]Do you have the marker?
[73:52.88]Yes.
[73:54.45]We are going.
[73:55.05]Up here.
[74:04.18]like a bridge or something why are we going up here we're gonna have to we're gonna have to jump man
[74:13.80]Can we get up there?
[74:15.18]I think we can.
[74:17.79]Dialog unlocks Sundara land map.
[74:22.83]What'd you just do?
[74:24.94]What did you do?
[74:25.78]What happened?
[74:26.80]What happened?
[74:27.39]Did you die?
[74:28.01]No, I was in the menu.
[74:31.44]Your character looked like they died.
[74:34.13]I jumped us off a cliff and it made the noise like dog.
[74:38.05]Wait, wait, wait.
[74:39.22]I had to jump off.
[74:42.69]What about the dog?
[74:44.63]What about him?
[74:52.80]Dear, can you run near some mushrooms so I can pick up some mushrooms, please?
[75:04.63]There's a whole colony of cats!
[75:11.80]Hey, I'm shaving while watching this.
[75:13.12]Can you go into detail about your shaving routine?
[75:16.34]Um...
[75:17.81]No.
[75:20.34]I use a...
[75:22.15]I use a safety razor.
[75:23.46]No, here's the tips, by the way.
[75:25.93]I'm just saying what I use.
[75:27.39]I think I have to end this and we can run up mountains.
[75:32.57]Alright, well, get off me.
[75:35.26]Does it look like it's on the other side of this?
[75:40.94]There's a butterfly quest or whatever this is.
[75:43.80]25 bear.
[75:44.18]25 bear?
[75:45.60]Let's go.
[75:53.80]That actually has a lot of health.
[76:14.96]Oh yeah, I forgot you could do that.
[76:21.96]Awesome.
[76:29.63]I wish I was a level 25 bear.
[76:32.32]That'd be kinda cool.
[76:36.77]Alright, make sure you get the bear meat.
[76:39.40]Okay, I need to... What is this?
[76:46.60]What is this big sword?
[76:50.86]What does a big sword mean?
[76:55.07]Um...
[76:57.34]I think that's a co-op thing, but we're in a team.
[77:01.32]I think that's like asking for help to do this bandit camp.
[77:10.36]Shit, I can't make any more medicine?
[77:11.81]I need meat.
[77:15.80]I need meat scraps.
[77:19.02]there's somebody in here man there's like a there's somebody there's like a boss in here
[77:29.20]This might be a little too hard for us, but whatever.
[77:37.75]Got him.
[77:39.91]I thought that guy would just turn to a bunch of meat for a second.
[77:47.77]Hmm.
[77:59.11]Plastic distract it while going to the boss.
[78:04.41]Yeah, well, I mean...
[78:07.11]There's an indicator on the screen.
[78:08.24]He clapped me!
[78:09.75]Oh my god.
[78:12.28]If I could do the clap.
[78:25.63]Good job, dude.
[78:26.61]Good job!
[78:29.02]Why does it say I have this on cooldown?
[78:31.46]Collect additional kills and... Yeah, I know.
[78:34.09]I did it.
[78:37.32]You have any scraps on him?
[78:40.58]Let's do this.
[78:41.26]Okay, stealth.
[78:43.91]We're doing this all wrong.
[78:45.56]Wrap around here.
[78:48.54]Do you actually have stealth?
[78:50.99]I mean, I think so.
[78:52.80]The go invisible?
[78:54.16]I don't have the go invisible.
[78:55.19]I can actually go invisible and like stealth kill.
[78:57.74]Alright, get a stealth kill on the guy on the right.
[79:08.07]I forget the button they've seen me
[79:18.09]We got three, so actually be careful.
[79:21.45]No.
[79:28.70]Grrrr!
[79:40.53]Ha ha ha!
[79:50.64]We're too powerful for them.
[79:55.94]You just have to believe.
[79:57.05]He's going all in.
[79:58.29]I need... Do these have to have meat scraps on them?
[80:01.80]Bone renewal.
[80:03.48]That's cannibalism, my guy.
[80:05.53]I need to make heals.
[80:10.96]I guess I could eat these raw.
[80:20.41]Alright, the scary guy's in here.
[80:24.36]You want to clear the whole camp first?
[80:26.59]This guy's mad at me.
[80:38.65]You need to hunt some deer.
[80:39.72]That's a good point.
[80:42.47]Very nice.
[80:49.11]Alright, here we go.
[80:50.60]He's looking kind of scary.
[80:53.22]He's just a named version of these guys.
[80:55.37]No, he's got a bar.
[81:03.15]Imagine that's happening to you.
[81:07.72]The meat grinder?
[81:09.00]No, his reaction was crazy.
[81:24.84]I did it early.
[81:27.87]Oh, you messed the whole thing up.
[81:33.66]He spawned another guy.
[81:34.55]He was in the house.
[81:38.86]Oh, he was in the house?
[81:40.30]Like that building spawned someone.
[81:42.51]I thought he spawned in.
[81:43.65]What'd he drop?
[82:00.09]How come I got no drip on this character?
[82:01.82]What are you talking about?
[82:02.56]What do you mean I got no drip?
[82:03.97]Excuse me.
[82:04.49]I mean, not compared to me.
[82:06.28]I'm making you look bad.
[82:09.10]You still talking now?
[82:10.00]Ooh.
[82:14.94]Shut him up.
[82:16.85]You still talking?
[82:24.49]Ooh!
[82:25.41]What about green?
[82:26.36]That matches.
[82:33.23]I think we both have the same thing on.
[82:40.17]I thought that said Grandma's Grove.
[82:42.76]This is not the same thing.
[82:45.87]Are you following me?
[82:46.78]I... Mike, I don't know what's going on.
[82:49.38]Hey, guy, I apparently am not as fast as you.
[82:53.55]But I'm doing the same motion?
[82:55.16]You look really weird on my screen.
[82:57.75]Alright, let's...
[82:59.83]I think I fucked it up.
[83:04.37]Wait, I need to hunt this deer.
[83:07.02]You're just jogging in place on my screen.
[83:09.09]I can't...
[83:09.45]I gotta get out of here.
[83:10.27]I can't leave your... Can you kick me off?
[83:12.48]No.
[83:14.52]Join me.
[83:15.52]Okay, we're going to join you.
[83:20.04]No distractions.
[83:21.38]I think I was stuck in your...
[83:28.04]I can't like get off.
[83:29.23]I can't.
[83:30.09]It thinks I'm like on you.
[83:33.55]But I broke off.
[83:34.49]Teleport to me.
[83:35.94]I tried to teleport to you.
[83:41.81]I think I may have severed our tie.
[83:44.69]Hold on.
[83:50.13]Uh, how do I teleport to you?
[83:55.11]The name down at the bottom, the two feet above the party?
[83:59.55]Gather?
[84:03.19]Waiting for member to follow.
[84:04.82]Okay, wait, wait, no, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[84:07.90]Can you, like, kick me off and invite me again?
[84:12.34]Because it thinks I'm on your mount, but I think I accidentally pressed a button and I jumped off and I screwed it up.
[84:18.32]I'm not running.
[84:20.55]Okay, invite me to run.
[84:27.51]Okay, I accept.
[84:29.78]There we go.
[84:32.12]Hey, that's better.
[84:37.18]I was pressing L2 square and I couldn't get up.
[84:47.68]See you later.
[84:50.92]Did it just stop you?
[84:52.02]It stopped me and you just fell.
[84:54.41]Oh, I tried to jump you off again.
[84:57.02]Oh, the guy's right here down here, though.
[85:00.30]As memorized.
[85:04.11]Oh, this is the guy.
[85:05.66]Oh, and you have a cooking pot.
[85:06.75]You need to cook.
[85:07.39]There's mushrooms.
[85:08.06]Oh, I took them.
[85:10.11]I would love to make some.
[85:12.52]Cookies.
[85:14.62]Some veggie mix.
[85:17.97]Buff food.
[85:18.64]Yeah, so this is the problem.
[85:19.54]I don't
[85:20.48]I told you I had to kill a deer and you went, no, run with me.
[85:29.34]Sorry.
[85:31.60]Alright.
[85:32.97]Sleepy.
[85:33.37]Where is he at?
[85:38.43]Right next to the camp.
[85:39.53]He's right here.
[85:43.35]Oh.
[85:44.79]Is this him?
[85:47.63]Ends of the Earth request or something.
[85:53.96]Oh, we got the map.
[85:55.13]This is where we got the map from this guy.
[85:58.31]Hey.
[86:02.50]unlocked new abilities.
[86:06.25]Oh, I think because we didn't have the map, it was telling me to go to him instead of the actual quest.
[86:11.53]Ah, okay.
[86:12.75]Well, now I think he's going to be on the map.
[86:16.71]which should be like right here.
[86:22.93]There's a campaign thing we can do there.
[86:24.42]There is...
[86:26.01]There's a shop.
[86:30.17]Where's the actual boss?
[86:33.36]It says we're tracking him.
[86:34.74]Oh, he's down here.
[86:35.38]Okay.
[86:36.53]He's a little skull down here.
[86:42.00]If you go back to Gorman's Grove, teleport back there.
[86:45.17]He's right below it.
[86:51.64]What does he look like?
[86:56.40]Good luck with this boss.
[86:58.55]Is this one hard?
[86:59.61]Yeah, this area was like higher level than us.
[87:03.35]Let's try.
[87:07.40]Oh, there's another horse.
[87:11.57]Donkey.
[87:12.04]Don't be scared, my little donkeys.
[87:18.47]Donk?
[87:18.94]Is it a donkey fight?
[87:24.75]Alright, so he's riding backwards on this thing.
[87:27.57]I have a little bit of experience fighting horses, so...
[87:36.43]Yowch.
[87:37.69]Yowch.
[87:41.82]Yowch.
[87:46.11]Oh my god!
[87:49.59]Why is he not doing any moves to you?
[87:53.14]Sorry.
[87:57.52]Holy shit, he annihilated me.
[88:02.56]Thank you.
[88:04.61]I'm not gonna waste heals because we need to learn the fight.
[88:16.72]He shoots projectiles that you... What is he doing?
[88:20.55]he goes to bed sometimes it seems like he does he just lays back like sleep oh no oh no that oh that's what I'm saying
[88:31.76]No!
[88:33.03]Uh oh.
[88:33.78]I was full stamina out from dodging that.
[88:41.60]You want me to die so we can reset it?
[88:45.91]I guess.
[88:47.39]I mean, you were going to die anyway, so it's like really smooth that you said that.
[88:52.01]yeah but I mean we need to learn the fight and then you're the healer and then I'm dps okay well now we know he goes to bed and he summons the Earth yeah
[89:01.36]And you have to parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, parry.
[89:03.97]Do you want to watch the cutscene every time?
[89:10.50]No?
[89:11.17]What?
[89:11.43]I don't think I had a skip button.
[89:15.97]Oh, my God.
[89:18.11]Alright.
[89:18.33]I got a funny way to ask that.
[89:22.84]What are you doing to him?
[89:25.90]He farted at me.
[89:32.05]It's better to block these things he's shooting at you than dodge.
[89:37.23]Holy shit, he just...
[89:41.26]I'm doing healing circle then.
[89:42.71]If you're hurt, just...
[89:54.51]Oh my goodness.
[89:58.66]He just teleported behind me.
[90:02.48]Oh
[90:07.46]Oh my god.
[90:09.37]Yeah, he shoots, shoots, shoots, and then jumps and does like an unblockable.
[90:12.77]I'm just using my heals, whatever.
[90:15.37]We can go get some deer after this if we need to.
[90:44.70]Oh, he's attacking you.
[90:45.50]Okay.
[90:51.43]Okay, here it comes.
[90:58.12]Did you not press it?
[91:04.24]I didn't press it.
[91:04.97]I thought you were gonna press it.
[91:06.40]I didn't press it, I thought you were gonna press it.
[91:08.89]Because I had my full cooldowns because I hadn't been using the sword.
[91:17.84]Damn it.
[91:23.73]Okay, it's like blink boom.
[91:36.07]Oh my god!
[91:40.26]He does it immediately again right after.
[91:41.63]Yeah.
[91:43.45]Or he did a gold attack.
[91:44.52]I don't know what that was.
[91:46.26]Okay.
[91:52.39]We are not through phase one, man.
[91:54.80]I don't think I don't think we're ready for this.
[91:56.58]Hey, it's alright.
[91:57.47]The chatter was right.
[91:59.24]Chatter was right, but whatever.
[92:01.03]We're doing fine.
[92:04.69]I gotta level my weapons up too.
[92:15.42]Maybe he takes more damage if we do the finisher.
[92:25.02]Oh, that's a double!
[92:26.75]He doubles it up on you.
[92:29.13]I'm gonna die.
[92:29.45]Double cheeseburger.
[92:38.30]We gotta see phase two, right?
[92:44.71]He's almost unlocked.
[92:47.68]Oh my God, I'm so, did I press?
[92:49.70]Whoa, that did, calm down.
[92:52.68]I'm dead.
[93:05.44]I think we can get him.
[93:05.96]Oh, he knocked me out of my res.
[93:09.01]Should I keep going?
[93:10.84]Uh, yeah.
[93:11.34]I mean, let's try to get him to phase two at least.
[93:18.48]that one's deceiving I don't think I'm gonna have another rez you have to parry like super early
[93:30.26]Where'd he go?
[93:42.48]Come on, dude, you can do it.
[93:49.60]My goat is washed.
[93:52.77]This is the second time we've gone into the boss's zone.
[93:56.86]There you go.
[93:57.24]You're up, you're up, you're up.
[94:11.55]I need you to focus, man.
[94:13.32]I'm doing it.
[94:13.80]I'm fine.
[94:20.09]Alright, we'll see phase two probably here.
[94:24.34]We can do this for sure.
[94:26.21]Unless this is crazy.
[94:30.66]Oh, what?
[94:32.11]Flashbang?
[94:32.69]The rushing bee?
[94:37.84]Oh, that's a gold attack now.
[94:40.63]Not deflectable.
[94:54.67]Oh shit, that stays up.
[94:57.72]These attacks are a little bit more confusing.
[95:08.02]I just, that's tough.
[95:15.90]Oh, it's gold!
[95:16.90]You were right!
[95:20.52]I was right.
[95:26.88]They'll know about that one there, little pup.
[95:29.84]I like that fight, though.
[95:30.64]That's a cool boss.
[95:32.31]Alright, hold on.
[95:36.63]You're doing it again.
[95:39.02]Oh, you want to watch this again?
[95:40.20]No, I'm saying... You walked into the circle.
[95:42.15]I did?
[95:42.84]Oh.
[95:43.32]Yeah, I didn't start this.
[95:44.79]You walked up to it.
[95:45.87]Shit.
[95:47.03]I...
[95:48.65]I just lose.
[95:53.29]Okay, I just lose, just lose.
[95:54.40]I have no heals and I wanted to upgrade my weapon.
[96:01.81]Dude came into this fight with an un-upgraded weapon.
[96:09.84]Why is it always in these games?
[96:12.45]that when you're trying to get hit, the boss doesn't care.
[96:16.71]But the second that you try to lock in, all they do is attack.
[96:26.98]He shit me to death.
[96:29.62]Alright, hold on.
[96:30.17]Let me... Let me see where I go here.
[96:32.54]Don't walk forward yet!
[96:33.18]You're about to run into it again!
[96:34.10]I'm trying not to.
[96:34.84]I'm trying not to.
[96:36.01]Trying not to walk forward.
[96:37.37]Hold on.
[96:37.88]I need to develop my character.
[96:40.24]Hands off the controller.
[96:41.93]It's this one that I want to upgrade.
[96:43.12]This one's...
[96:46.84]Oh, I can't.
[96:48.15]I don't have enough to, I don't have enough of this material.
[96:50.38]I can do this one though.
[96:57.52]This is tier 30.
[97:05.64]Okay, this thing is better?
[97:07.50]I think?
[97:17.68]We'll never know.
[97:18.65]It's not.
[97:20.46]Didn't I just, I just enhanced it, right?
[97:25.16]I have to repair it?
[97:25.82]I don't have any repair.
[97:29.63]Wait, I got some better weapons.
[97:30.80]Oh, wait a minute.
[97:32.55]What is this?
[97:33.51]Oh my God.
[97:34.20]Did I just actually spend on a fucking blue?
[97:43.77]I think we're good.
[97:50.73]No, I think we're fine.
[97:56.19]Yeah, we like upgrade.
[97:57.62]I think it is universal, though, I think, isn't it?
[98:07.33]I don't know.
[98:07.67]I don't know what you're talking about.
[98:09.02]Like when you enhance your character.
[98:10.27]I think you're enhancing the slot, not necessarily the weapon.
[98:13.01]Yeah.
[98:16.95]Okay.
[98:19.20]I got any better?
[98:19.90]I got these are better.
[98:20.68]This is better.
[98:26.74]This is better.
[98:27.44]Make sure you put on all your upgraded stuff.
[98:33.10]Yeah.
[98:43.00]I think I have a talent point.
[98:44.03]Okay, yeah, I got points.
[98:45.30]Let's get prepared.
[98:46.28]Arena talent.
[98:49.58]Oh, okay.
[98:54.36]This one.
[98:58.80]Make sure you put your points in.
[99:01.17]Dual weapon slot.
[99:03.18]Yeah.
[99:06.43]Another salon.
[99:07.29]What is this one?
[99:10.07]Serene Breeze.
[99:16.25]That's cool.
[99:27.17]Poison.
[99:27.77]I want that.
[99:28.59]Did you just walk in?
[99:30.10]I walked like one inch forward from where you were.
[99:32.81]Alright.
[99:33.03]Well, you were giving me shit.
[99:35.01]And you're the one that walked in.
[99:36.78]But you are the one that's there!
[99:38.55]I was just next to you!
[99:41.20]And I'm still on the menu.
[99:43.35]He's attacking you.
[99:44.80]Well, I had it circled.
[99:46.68]Alright.
[99:49.63]I wasn't ready for this.
[99:52.72]I do have a dual weapon skill now.
[99:54.07]You could dodge one though.
[99:56.30]Are you dead?
[99:57.20]Yeah, I was in the menu when he attacked me.
[99:59.25]I got hit by three things.
[100:03.41]I don't even have any heals either.
[100:04.71]We need to...
[100:05.28]I need to kill a deer.
[100:12.26]My goat is washed.
[100:14.05]I...
[100:15.02]I've been washed since, like, 2019.
[100:17.74]They're donkeys.
[100:19.22]Stop walking forward.
[100:22.69]We need to get a... We need to kill something.
[100:25.58]I like this area.
[100:26.59]There we go.
[100:29.32]Frightened villager.
[100:32.40]No.
[100:33.12]Stay on task.
[100:44.86]Okay.
[100:49.39]Prime meat cut?
[100:50.21]Does that matter?
[100:55.41]There's more on the road for me.
[100:57.01]I look like we might be shooting different deer in our own deer versus.
[101:06.86]Okay, let's see.
[101:07.46]Is that enough to...
[101:20.04]No, I need shittier meat than this.
[101:27.77]Oh, I need to- I like the real nasty stuff.
[101:30.18]I gotta talk to the chef.
[101:31.35]I need like the dirty, I need like the stanky food, you know what I mean?
[101:36.38]we can teleport back to the starting river there's a bunch of deer there
[101:43.72]I need the scraps.
[101:45.29]It says I need scrap parts of animals.
[101:49.68]Does this count?
[101:58.30]There we go.
[101:58.70]Meat scraps.
[102:01.57]The six cat monk.
[102:07.04]I just found an insane amount of stuff.
[102:11.00]You probably can buy this as well.
[102:18.58]The town.
[102:19.13]And there's a shop that sells meat for dirt cheap.
[102:22.70]Look for the vendor icon.
[102:25.18]I might just teleport over there and do this quick.
[102:30.40]Here's a shop.
[102:31.04]This is Meow Meow Temple.
[102:35.74]Looking for another vendor.
[102:39.25]Bounty.
[102:43.69]Okay, here's a shop.
[102:46.06]Peddler at Heaven's Pier.
[102:48.90]Could I buy it from... Where's the best place to buy it?
[102:53.87]No life story available.
[102:55.96]General Goods, probably.
[102:57.47]We haven't even been over there.
[103:02.36]The meat tells you what shop it's in.
[103:04.45]Oh, does it?
[103:07.36]Yeah, you have to get the VIN number from the side of the meat.
[103:11.60]Oh, okay.
[103:12.33]The general goods vendor.
[103:13.95]What's up?
[103:15.05]Do you press F2 when you're out?
[103:16.67]You want to press F2.
[103:18.58]F2.
[103:19.72]Yes.
[103:20.23]And then you go to...
[103:21.91]Which one do you want?
[103:22.41]E to the right.
[103:23.20]To talent and then dance now.
[103:27.88]OK. And you pick a dance.
[103:33.09]It won't let me do it.
[103:35.15]Okay, it says your team members can... We just did the same one.
[103:39.41]Yeah, I'm joining you.
[103:40.72]Oh.
[103:41.74]We're putting on a show.
[103:49.37]This is about, you know, me and the boys doing this before we beat the donkey guy.
[103:55.25]Some of these, I was doing some of these, some are like three minutes long.
[103:58.51]Really?
[103:59.70]Yeah, they're very elaborate.
[104:02.04]They all have their own music.
[104:04.39]Well, I want to see the other ones.
[104:07.07]That one was short.
[104:08.36]Now how about, um, how about Velvet Shade?
[104:17.75]Gonna be stepping on my toes.
[104:21.45]Nice misstep there.
[104:23.26]I'm getting my arm drapes in your face.
[104:25.53]One, two, and one, two, get it together.
[104:27.84]Your head looks like it moves so much because you have this giant chin.
[104:39.51]Your character.
[104:40.49]I don't think it's changed her expression the whole time that...
[104:45.19]I don't think she can.
[104:46.61]I think that you have pulled the mouth so high that the smile is a frown.
[104:51.66]you can uh you can also like do everything independent so like the eyes don't look in the same direction
[104:59.50]Oh, we became one.
[105:01.07]We became one.
[105:02.00]We did become one.
[105:10.44]Alright, how about one more?
[105:11.43]One more.
[105:11.82]Joyful cheers.
[105:20.51]Uh, that one is pretty sick.
[105:24.66]Alright, high mountains and flowing water.
[105:28.24]I got you addicted to Just Dance mode.
[105:30.79]I mean, this is... Do you want to talk about emote animations?
[105:33.99]These are, like I said, these are like two or three minutes long.
[105:37.93]no there's one that was that was really really long I remember it was might have been heavens of something near the bottom
[105:46.45]I just got to level 25 because of that.
[105:49.09]Woo!
[105:50.26]Grats.
[105:50.92]GZ, man.
[105:52.03]Cool.
[105:53.98]Okay.
[105:55.28]So now, let me...
[105:56.43]I need to go to that shop.
[105:58.86]I gotta buy a bunch of shit here.
[106:02.28]Where was it?
[106:04.11]Right here.
[106:06.41]There we go.
[106:08.34]I'm going to buy so many eggs.
[106:12.03]So I need to go there.
[106:13.46]You can do whatever you want, but I gotta, I gotta, I gotta get some stuff.
[106:29.70]Let me ride my horse for the first time in the entire time we've been playing.
[106:37.66]Wait, stop following me.
[106:41.51]You can't go do your own adventure for 10 minutes.
[106:43.46]You gotta stay, like, you gotta teleport to me.
[106:45.80]Where are you going, my master?
[106:49.78]Can you please teach me a technique?
[106:51.72]I really want to learn from you.
[106:53.81]You're so strong and powerful.
[106:55.68]Well, the technique I could teach you, it's going to take a lot of time for you to learn it.
[107:01.93]I don't care.
[107:02.51]I have the time and the dedication.
[107:04.26]You don't know anything.
[107:04.92]I can split that rock in two.
[107:06.89]The last time you were in town, you turned into a goose.
[107:10.96]I can't hear what you're saying because I'm trying to be the main character and you're talking first.
[107:14.81]I ran a lady over.
[107:16.35]Am I going to get arrested?
[107:19.22]Okay.
[107:23.13]Let's go.
[107:23.67]I'm buying up your whole store.
[107:27.92]Meat scraps.
[107:29.07]I'll take 100, please.
[107:34.43]Is this stupid?
[107:35.78]Should I?
[107:36.34]How many?
[107:36.70]What do I need?
[107:38.49]100?
[107:38.80]Why not?
[107:39.52]I just bought 50 of them.
[107:41.52]Aren't there going to be like better healing things later when you need the prime meat?
[107:45.45]I mean, I'll buy the prime meat too.
[107:46.84]I got 300, I got 300,000 bucks.
[107:51.88]I'm buying eggs.
[107:52.85]I'm going to buy this whole store.
[107:53.75]I need mushrooms too.
[107:54.55]This village is going to...
[107:56.30]They're not going to be able to eat for two winters.
[107:59.32]You took all of their stock.
[108:02.75]This wants me to buy two, but I bought 40.
[108:10.76]Alright, there you go.
[108:12.56]Let's go.
[108:12.94]Time to make some potions.
[108:22.32]Here we go.
[108:23.85]Ooh.
[108:24.94]A steamed mix of wild greens and mushrooms restores 4,500 HP over three seconds.
[108:30.36]Cook that please.
[108:36.06]Cook.
[108:38.87]I can only make four of them?
[108:41.72]Didn't I buy like $50,000 worth of ingredients?
[108:45.98]What other ingredient are you missing?
[108:49.33]Or maybe you have a limit on how many you can hold.
[108:51.92]Oh, okay.
[108:53.27]I need herbs.
[108:57.05]Oh shit, hold on.
[108:59.26]Honestly, I would just eat it without the herbs.
[109:01.95]Yeah, same.
[109:04.54]Like seasoning is great and all, but.
[109:06.57]I can buy insects too.
[109:11.61]Can you imagine being a- your life, you're the bug salesman?
[109:15.33]Well, he's got all this stuff too.
[109:16.43]That's just a different inventory.
[109:19.09]But he's really passionate about the bugs.
[109:24.37]There we go.
[109:25.16]Alright.
[109:27.43]I'm going to make 50 of these.
[109:28.76]Can I hold 50 of these?
[109:31.73]Dude, I, this is expensive.
[109:46.46]I made five heals and it was like 50 grand.
[109:49.37]Oh wait, no, no, no, no.
[109:50.23]We're good.
[109:53.75]You have expensive tastes.
[109:59.35]I can only make five at a time.
[110:07.82]So you're eating bugs?
[110:09.65]I'm crafting healing potions.
[110:11.86]You should do this too.
[110:13.05]I know you're a healer, but you probably should do this too.
[110:17.44]I think the healing is more effective on me when I do it.
[110:20.90]Because I get like a full heal from it.
[110:26.71]Okay.
[110:27.61]I think that's good for now.
[110:28.90]I should have a lot.
[110:34.02]Where are they stored?
[110:42.45]Oh, I got a chest I didn't even open.
[110:46.23]Um, excuse me?
[110:47.05]You're excused.
[110:51.63]Oh, I didn't get the thing I wanted.
[110:56.63]Alright, let's go.
[110:59.14]I should have all my potions now.
[111:01.33]And I upgraded my character's weapon.
[111:04.42]Can we play chess?
[111:07.67]Meow meow.
[111:10.90]Oh, you need to be friends with this guy to play chess.
[111:16.52]And we know how you are with friends.
[111:18.67]You say like, sorry, I didn't mean to do the invite.
[111:21.74]It's true.
[111:22.14]Alright.
[111:24.87]You ready to go try this guy again?
[111:27.26]Did you get this chest up here?
[111:35.45]I'm nowhere near you.
[111:36.21]You're welcome, by the way.
[111:43.56]Alright, let's go back to the boss.
[111:46.53]What do we see here?
[111:54.22]Raid boss take two.
[111:55.81]Yeah.
[111:56.47]Let me make sure I do.
[111:57.33]Did I actually develop everything?
[112:00.87]Here we go.
[112:01.23]A nameless spear.
[112:10.15]Yeah.
[112:11.76]Yep.
[112:14.85]Level 20.
[112:15.69]Make sure your weapon is level 20.
[112:21.44]There's like an ominous evil swamp at the bottom of this hill.
[112:26.53]Let's go get it.
[112:27.80]It's like Blighttown down here.
[112:34.08]Oh, and there's a combat campaign thing.
[112:35.87]I don't know if we can do it together.
[112:39.84]Maybe you can just do it.
[112:45.08]Are we doing the donkey boss?
[112:46.27]Yeah, I think so.
[112:48.36]We're going to try.
[112:49.08]My character is poisoned too, which is weird.
[112:55.83]Am I going the right way?
[112:57.40]I'm in the poison swamp.
[112:59.91]You don't want to fight the world boss again?
[113:01.77]I'm coming up.
[113:02.98]You are at the wrong place.
[113:04.86]I am at the right place.
[113:05.82]Wait, no you're not.
[113:06.73]I went to the wrong place.
[113:07.61]I went to the poison swamp.
[113:11.08]I just bet 250,000 channel points.
[113:12.91]Please do this for me.
[113:15.16]Believers, I'm really sorry, but that...
[113:20.78]I tried as hard as I could to make sure you got that one.
[113:23.41]I can't guarantee it ever again.
[113:24.96]Uh-oh.
[113:26.95]I think I accidentally started it.
[113:30.30]I might hope I'm here.
[113:32.08]Are we good?
[113:36.45]Why are we?
[113:37.06]He seems peaceful.
[113:39.03]I don't know.
[113:39.32]He's a world boss.
[113:55.10]Ah, the tooth.
[113:57.83]Got it.
[113:59.32]Alright, this is going much better now.
[114:04.06]Shit, right when I say it, are you kidding me?
[114:12.04]Oh my god, I'm so- okay.
[114:14.25]I'm- I- I gotta stop talking.
[114:17.93]No more speaking this whole fight.
[114:21.78]Not another word.
[114:29.11]Wrong weapon.
[114:32.56]That was a good one.
[114:39.26]Yeah!
[114:58.75]Why is he attacking me still?
[114:59.99]I can't see him attacking you.
[115:02.84]You gotta do it.
[115:06.81]Alright, this is going much better.
[115:10.55]He just kicked me in the face.
[115:23.47]Oh shit!
[115:35.66]I parried almost every single one of those.
[115:37.13]It was a Christmas miracle.
[115:39.26]Healing circle.
[115:44.94]Trying to keep you juiced, man.
[115:46.32]I'm trying.
[116:00.29]Healing circle.
[116:01.50]I'm trying to keep juice, man.
[116:03.70]I'm trying to stay alive.
[116:05.87]Sorry, just let him do his thing.
[116:07.32]Let's heal.
[116:10.98]You need to parry those.
[116:14.22]Give me more notes.
[116:18.98]Well, because I think it builds stun meter if you...
[116:23.35]Apparently.
[116:35.46]Let's go.
[116:52.39]Damage.
[116:55.70]Alright, you do it.
[116:59.81]What's it going?
[117:00.24]Oh, okay.
[117:01.44]Alright, phase two.
[117:02.16]Phase two.
[117:07.93]Where's my heal on cooldown?
[117:25.99]Okay, remember gold attack now.
[117:27.76]I couldn't dodge.
[117:31.40]Dude what do you do in this phase?
[117:41.11]Just gotta not get hit, I guess.
[117:44.50]Easier said than done.
[117:47.07]What?
[117:48.13]Oh.
[117:51.89]Dude, I just like woke up from a nightmare.
[117:54.46]Okay, if it cut to me going in bed.
[117:57.30]How did you die?
[117:58.06]I don't know.
[117:58.97]He just killed me.
[118:04.81]Didn't I only use one heal?
[118:06.85]It said it was on cooldown.
[118:08.13]Can I only heal once per phase or something?
[118:11.47]I'm out of heals now.
[118:17.45]I don't even know how you actually refilled them
[118:20.59]Uh, I made them?
[118:22.08]You have to cra- I think I can- I have, like, food that I made, but I don't have- Alright, so go to, like, Meat Scraps.
[118:31.88]then go to more oh and then go to craft I think I equipped a different food
[118:42.13]I guess I could he- could I eat these too?
[118:44.00]Wait a minute.
[118:45.00]Is this...
[118:47.62]I think I might have to equip those.
[118:50.90]Wait, where's the... the craft?
[118:53.34]I see.
[118:53.64]I think I see.
[118:55.41]Can I put this on like the quick bar?
[119:02.53]That food is out of combat.
[119:03.96]Is that out of combat, the one that it made?
[119:05.91]Yeah, the food.
[119:12.55]Oh, exit combat.
[119:13.84]Okay.
[119:17.67]We can do it.
[119:24.04]Only medicine counts?
[119:25.61]Okay.
[119:29.28]Well, I got two.
[119:29.96]You should be able to have a maximum of two.
[119:33.97]Mhm.
[119:34.87]We can try it again.
[119:36.66]Alright, this time we'll get it.
[119:38.07]Remember, we're like five levels lower than this guy.
[119:40.78]Yeah, and the second phase is just when he does the wind, wind, wind.
[119:44.19]If you get hit by one, you're like stun locked.
[119:47.73]And you get blasted by everything.
[119:49.73]We'll try this one more time.
[119:52.56]Are you gonna watch this every time?
[119:53.51]I'm skipping.
[120:19.06]Shit it's a little delay
[120:31.32]I like went forward.
[120:35.44]That was weird.
[120:56.65]I need stamina.
[121:01.15]OK, my heart is like morning dew.
[121:06.85]Oh, we don't have the thing.
[121:08.57]He's almost armor broken.
[121:15.76]Dammit!
[121:16.60]Alright, I got that at least.
[121:26.47]What is he doing to me?
[121:28.16]What just happened?
[121:33.31]I'm dead.
[121:33.69]I don't even know what the fuck just happened.
[121:37.22]I let him jump on me.
[121:38.55]He farted all over you.
[121:39.51]I think you got poison.
[121:41.46]Can you parry the farting?
[121:44.45]I don't think he's ever done that move to me.
[121:48.75]Can you parry the farting?
[121:51.44]I mean, it's a good question, right?
[121:53.35]Probably.
[121:53.99]I've never even seen it.
[121:56.76]It's not golden farts.
[121:59.63]Dude, Golden Farts is like...
[122:03.38]Dude, did you eat like seven hard-boiled eggs today?
[122:06.05]That's how you get those.
[122:08.46]I'm already fucking dead.
[122:20.45]I actually am.
[122:22.10]I couldn't tell for the first half of my health bar if he was attacking you or me because we were both getting it.
[122:27.60]How are we getting worse?
[122:28.60]We got him down to like half last time.
[122:34.27]I love watching you get blasted by those rocks.
[122:39.32]Alright, three more.
[122:40.99]It's nighttime now.
[122:41.81]Three more tries and then we're done.
[122:44.08]We have to beat it, right?
[122:45.19]Come on.
[122:49.11]I feel like there's a pretty big break point in your level of like a lot of stuff is saying I'm too low level and I think level 20 is a big deal.
[122:56.57]I'm 19, you're 20.
[122:59.10]Shut up!
[123:07.16]Whaaat?
[123:19.77]I'm not even sure if that's a great time to do that.
[123:30.70]What the?
[123:32.73]He's kind of going outside the battle zone.
[123:35.94]I can't move.
[123:42.01]He's like trying to get on his horse.
[123:45.16]What's going on?
[123:48.14]I'm stuck outside the... You seem to be having some trouble.
[123:54.72]I think I'm stuck outside the fighting zone.
[124:00.30]Can I move?
[124:01.03]Alright, I'm good.
[124:13.26]kicking my ass with his ass.
[124:21.75]How am I not powering that?
[124:25.84]I don't know how.
[124:34.27]Did you get it?
[124:34.76]Oh, I thought you got it.
[124:36.62]Me too.
[124:38.44]I thought I parried that too, but it was me getting kicked.
[124:41.67]I did it-I saw it in my imagination.
[124:43.76]I parry-I-okay, I'm parrying him in my imagination.
[124:45.93]I need to play the game.
[124:48.25]I'm literally parrying him in my head and I can't parry anything!
[124:51.24]I'm seeing the game like 10% slower!
[124:56.70]Oh my god, I was pairing him in my head.
[124:59.82]I was playing two different games.
[125:01.26]Do it in your hands.
[125:03.64]There's a real life.
[125:05.00]God damn it.
[125:05.85]Alright.
[125:06.65]We might be five to ten levels too low for this.
[125:11.40]What do you want to do?
[125:12.20]The believers are going to have to get a government bailout after this.
[125:15.29]We can go down to the swamp that was down here.
[125:17.28]It looked like we could do that together.
[125:18.57]Alright, last try, and then we're going to the swamp.
[125:21.14]Okay.
[125:21.26]Okay.
[125:26.72]Yeah, get out of the dream realm on this one.
[125:28.90]I know, I'm doing it.
[125:38.43]Okay, let's go.
[126:08.23]So bad.
[126:20.80]I'm healing you, but your health is going down fast.
[126:28.38]Yeah, I know.
[126:33.82]That should take so much endurance.
[126:43.18]Oh my god, I was in the middle of a swing.
[126:49.80]The fart.
[126:50.97]The fart.
[126:51.81]The fart is unbelievable.
[127:02.91]I have not parried a single attack this entire fight.
[127:06.91]Except for that one.
[127:10.99]Okay.
[127:14.55]Okay.
[127:21.07]He's on the plate.
[127:24.91]Strategic retreat.
[127:38.95]We're getting them.
[127:42.57]Shit, that one's so quick.
[127:45.32]Oh my god.
[127:49.23]so
[128:01.03]What's going on?
[128:01.52]Oh shit.
[128:07.83]That's what happens when you parry.
[128:10.11]I've done that like four times.
[128:17.44]Yeah, in your head.
[128:18.29]Dude, you don't understand.
[128:46.28]Alright.
[128:54.59]God damn.
[129:12.20]Good heals.
[129:14.99]Yeah, keep it up.
[129:21.15]One of those hit me in the face.
[129:25.52]He is our adversary.
[129:27.47]He is trying to do that.
[129:28.57]Okay, phase two.
[129:28.99]I got no heals.
[129:30.18]Good luck.
[129:30.74]GG.
[129:31.30]Sorry, Believers.
[129:33.89]Wait, why is he...
[129:36.34]Wait.
[129:36.52]What is he doing?
[129:37.70]Space 2.
[129:39.39]He's supposed to teleport us to this dimension.
[129:41.94]He just started doing other attacks.
[129:54.14]Be careful about those briars.
[129:55.72]I don't think you can parry them.
[129:56.85]Yeah, and I think they stay up even after you're done doing damage to them.
[130:01.55]And they still hurt you if they're up.
[130:07.50]Oh no.
[130:15.00]Dude, leave me alone!
[130:17.65]Dude, what the hell?
[130:19.15]He's just pulling out a machine gun.
[130:22.66]Dude, that fucking reaction.
[130:23.62]I'm permanently locked in a parry here.
[130:25.59]Don't make me laugh.
[130:26.27]This is the closest we've come.
[130:30.89]Oh, you're dead.
[130:31.52]Fuck.
[130:34.39]God damn it.
[130:35.20]Yeah, no, no.
[130:36.12]Those, you have to parry those.
[130:37.41]You can't dodge.
[130:39.06]We go again.
[130:40.29]One more time.
[130:41.26]All I hear is, leave me alone!
[130:45.39]He's just spamming.
[130:46.71]I think if you just parry them in that phase, though, his stun bar was almost gone.
[130:52.16]Gone.
[130:52.84]Alright, we got it right now.
[131:12.10]I cannot believe he hit me with that.
[131:14.15]I'm sad.
[131:14.81]I almost died.
[131:18.22]I've been trying to switch my weapon the whole time.
[131:27.61]I got hit by like everything somehow.
[131:33.80]And I should have parried that.
[131:37.16]Dude, I'm fucking...
[131:38.99]I'm bummed.
[131:39.40]I told him.
[131:40.89]We're getting worse.
[131:45.38]Yeah, we're getting worse.
[131:47.49]He's got two of those red parry moves.
[131:49.61]One of them is like... And the other one is like...
[131:57.07]We're also very underleveled.
[131:59.98]So all the people that are hating right now, we're about 5 to 10 levels underleveled.
[132:05.50]So take your hating somewhere else.
[132:23.55]I was not ready for that immediately.
[132:37.56]doing great man keep up the keep up the good work
[132:55.43]What the fuck?
[132:56.55]I have no stamina!
[133:00.38]You know what doesn't cost stamina?
[133:03.55]Parries.
[133:06.73]That's my master.
[133:15.05]I don't know how you...
[133:16.50]I don't know how you parry that.
[133:18.17]I was trying one, two, three, four, five.
[133:24.28]You can kind of just mash it until the last two rocks have a different timing.
[133:30.63]Thanks for watching!
[133:47.49]I don't understand.
[134:00.56]I pressed the wrong button.
[134:02.60]It's okay.
[134:04.93]Oh my god, now I'm all flustered and all fucked up.
[134:13.30]Hmm.
[134:28.02]Oh my God, I have no stamina.
[134:31.19]You know it doesn't cost stamina.
[134:36.18]And depletes his stun meter.
[134:39.53]You know what it costs you stamina?
[134:40.98]Healing you.
[134:50.99]Thank you.
[135:03.31]Let's go!
[135:08.54]Okay.
[135:21.26]If we just did everything perfect this would be easy I know
[135:28.75]Shit, that is so fast.
[135:30.73]It's like a blink.
[135:32.22]If you're in the middle of an attack, good luck.
[135:37.97]I'm showing him a lot of respect when I get up close now.
[135:44.45]Yeah, dude, I think this is, this is, we gotta approach this not as a fight, fight, fight.
[135:48.63]We gotta approach this as a just run away and only fight when we can.
[135:54.25]Parry those.
[135:55.68]No.
[135:57.44]Please, it deals the stun meter.
[135:59.92]No.
[136:00.86]And you're going to say you have no stamina.
[136:02.67]No.
[136:07.03]Yeah, dude, his stun meter went down like 25% from you blocking those.
[136:13.18]Okay, the fart is just...
[136:14.73]It's just...
[136:15.51]It's just...
[136:16.48]The fart's crazy.
[136:17.22]That's the hardest move to fucking even know what's going on.
[136:19.55]That move's hard.
[136:23.61]Whatever happened to parry those?
[136:28.00]This is the fucking third time I've resurrected you.
[136:29.77]I don't want to hear it.
[136:33.91]Okay.
[136:51.78]I'm dead.
[137:07.91]If you're only using one weapon, are you?
[137:10.36]Nope
[137:20.55]Okay.
[137:28.23]Do you think we should do the poison swamp?
[137:30.32]Do you think this is too... Do we need to get five levels?
[137:33.63]I don't think that I have potions anymore.
[137:37.37]Let's check out the poison swamp.
[137:38.98]Let's check the poison.
[137:39.87]We admit defeat.
[137:42.08]It's right here.
[137:45.54]I was just walked into it again to start it again.
[137:54.87]Your combined IQ is 50 points of that fight.
[137:57.79]We would need to combine... That would be where we'd be at level.
[138:01.30]If we had combined 50, we're both...
[138:03.43]He's, what are you, 19 and I'm 22?
[138:05.75]That's a level 25 fight.
[138:07.92]We gotta get level up.
[138:10.84]What the?
[138:16.71]Oh no, I'm in the swamp.
[138:19.47]I saw a chest and I wanted it.
[138:24.54]These guys are fucking crazy.
[138:25.86]I'm just getting the chest and running.
[138:28.51]We're jumping down the... You're still up there.
[138:30.62]I saw a chest.
[138:33.94]Why can I not move?
[138:35.37]Oh my god, these guys hit so fucking hard!
[138:37.68]Give me the chest!
[138:40.08]Okay, I cannot open the chest in combat.
[138:42.38]Good to know.
[138:42.74]I'm coming to you.
[138:44.35]All I've been trying to do is hit R2 on the chest.
[138:58.12]Okay.
[138:58.77]Hello.
[139:00.83]Hello.
[139:06.00]Poison swamp, huh?
[139:07.14]Is there any quests down here?
[139:08.97]uh right in front of me there's something but if you walk in the swamp you kind of sink into it so I think you gotta it just also doesn't let you double jump down here
[139:19.28]OK. Can you touch?
[139:26.13]I think there was some co-op restriction.
[139:27.74]Hero's tomb.
[139:28.72]I think this is where somebody died.
[139:33.89]Can't really get to him.
[139:36.71]Okay.
[139:37.30]So I'm an all teammates at the quest location.
[139:40.76]I guess we're doing this?
[139:49.61]Okay.
[139:53.48]So, a sudden drumming echoes across the long deserted body sea.
[140:03.51]This guy's drumming.
[140:04.93]Chest.
[140:15.91]chest in here these guys are possessed they said they can't let it stop drumming do we have to kill him I think we have to defend him from drumming right
[140:25.67]Defend him from the drumming?
[140:28.20]No, defend him from being- stopping the drumming.
[140:34.49]Can you open that?
[140:36.18]No.
[140:41.10]There's a chest in there.
[140:44.92]Talk to him again?
[140:45.52]The other drums, why did they stop?
[140:51.16]Okay, there are other drummers here we have to activate, I think.
[140:54.37]Yeah.
[140:54.90]The drum beats invite you to explore.
[141:03.99]I just picked a frog.
[141:09.56]Time to develop.
[141:14.44]Oh shit, there is poison in there.
[141:17.35]Do you have any indicators or are we just supposed to look around this area?
[141:21.40]Look around.
[141:25.84]I think every once in a while it keeps showing me like a... a sound direction, you know, over this direction.
[141:31.03]You can turn on your gamer sense too, by the way.
[141:35.16]Oh yeah.
[141:39.53]What's going on with that?
[141:45.90]There are people just hanging out here though.
[141:49.93]This enemy's on me.
[141:53.40]I think we can revive them or something.
[142:03.46]Ah, there is a drummer here.
[142:18.85]brought another guy sorry and I don't know what I just want oh that was what you did
[142:32.05]Still alive, huh?
[142:35.52]Oh right, they can heal with their last breath.
[142:38.13]I think they'll end up dying after this.
[142:51.15]Like morning dew.
[142:59.82]My strength keeps feeling drained in that corner.
[143:02.51]It was like a very dangerous corner.
[143:07.20]Okay, we just avoid them?
[143:08.53]I don't think we can kill them.
[143:09.37]We have to wait till they go through their bar.
[143:14.22]Huh?
[143:16.73]Hmph.
[143:16.93]He's on the point.
[143:20.32]I think you have to strike this drum as well.
[143:35.02]There's some epic swamp gameplay.
[143:38.28]Is this game free to play on Steam and mobile?
[143:45.21]Glad you asked.
[143:46.51]Absolutely.
[143:50.38]There's also PvP in the game.
[143:52.26]We did it last time.
[143:59.17]Apparently there's sumo wrestling that I wanted to see, but we might not be able to get to Kaifeng.
[144:05.63]I think we can walk there and do the stuff, but I don't know.
[144:09.39]We could try.
[144:09.88]OK, well, let's finish this.
[144:11.99]I think there's more.
[144:14.38]Does it have controller support on mobile?
[144:16.12]Or are you saying it has controller support on mobile?
[144:18.11]Does it actually?
[144:19.61]I've not even looked into it.
[144:22.14]I mean, can't you?
[144:24.57]I don't plug a controller into anything these days.
[144:26.34]My com- my toilet takes one.
[144:30.09]I don't think people are saying we can't walk there.
[144:33.67]We might have to actually do a whole thing.
[144:37.48]Have we got that one?
[144:38.16]We got that one.
[144:39.72]What does the map look like here?
[144:41.57]Alright, it's just this giant area.
[144:43.82]There's an alligator in the water.
[144:45.48]Crocodile.
[144:46.37]Use your vision.
[144:49.46]Oh my god, let's go say hello.
[144:53.46]Love a croc.
[145:01.88]Is it attack?
[145:04.16]It tries to eat me.
[145:10.43]It is circling us.
[145:13.60]There's a chest here.
[145:20.17]Where is it?
[145:24.69]It's like right below you.
[145:25.98]Is it below me?
[145:27.00]It is right below me.
[145:27.98]Crocodile.
[145:29.33]Weakness.
[145:30.45]Develop.
[145:32.64]I can develop a crocodile sense?
[145:42.67]I can't really.
[145:45.10]I don't know that's him doing that or was that me?
[145:49.92]You don't know.
[145:50.83]Let's find the other drum.
[145:52.84]There's one here.
[146:00.22]strategic retreat
[146:09.21]Hmm.
[146:19.33]This guy's just hitting me and I wasn't even looking.
[146:22.84]Oh!
[146:34.57]Oh!
[146:38.40]Dude, those are some laser-focused parries if I've ever seen one.
[146:43.28]Strike this drum.
[146:44.45]Wait, I want that chest.
[146:47.35]Crocodile.
[146:48.71]It doesn't matter.
[146:49.13]He's not gonna hurt me.
[147:01.05]See?
[147:01.67]He was friendly.
[147:04.20]Uh, secret passage over here.
[147:13.54]Reached level cap.
[147:14.80]Oh, you did like a whole level cap quest at 20, didn't you?
[147:19.29]I did not because I just hit 20.
[147:21.54]I did the level 20 cap thing, yeah.
[147:25.09]I didn't.
[147:29.89]Okay.
[147:40.74]I think there's another one.
[147:43.53]I see it coming from over here.
[147:46.71]I think there's two more.
[147:57.70]The power of these drums.
[148:00.22]This one here is the one we already got.
[148:04.62]After we do this drum mission, we can move on.
[148:10.73]It is fun though.
[148:14.14]I'm sad we didn't kill the boss, but he is hard and cool and fun.
[148:20.60]And sick.
[148:22.03]Well, you'll get to do that on your iPad on the toilet.
[148:24.80]That is very true.
[148:27.16]Um...
[148:31.06]The only one that's showing up is that one.
[148:33.19]Did I like not activate that one?
[148:45.12]I don't know.
[148:48.49]It's on the other side.
[148:52.37]Neither of you picked the umbrella.
[148:55.33]Yeah.
[148:56.62]Apparently the umbrella's crazy.
[148:58.91]Uh, alright.
[149:01.08]Does he get a huge raid?
[149:01.90]It seems cool.
[149:03.41]We get a big raid?
[149:05.06]Hold on.
[149:06.30]Who raided?
[149:08.71]Let me see.
[149:19.53]Alfina VT.
[149:21.94]Thanks for the ride.
[149:22.59]Welcome everybody.
[149:25.32]Appreciate the ride.
[149:30.70]Currently in the middle of a sponsor segment, so be good.
[149:38.17]And can one of the Raiders please ask me what platforms this gosh darn thing is on?
[149:43.07]No, I'm kidding.
[149:46.83]Not, can I tell you?
[149:47.92]It's, can you ask me so I'm allowed to tell you?
[149:50.43]Please ask.
[149:57.53]Yeah, welcome.
[149:58.21]Thanks, Leroyd.
[149:59.84]And... Ster is currently fighting something.
[150:02.01]Let's fight with Ster.
[150:04.68]It took so much strength for you to not say, let's fight, Star.
[150:11.74]True.
[150:21.88]Alright, he's going crazy.
[150:24.00]Thought he was swinging overhead.
[150:28.53]Immaculate.
[150:30.02]Perfect.
[150:31.06]Why don't you do it then?
[150:34.58]Let's see you do it, tough guy.
[150:36.03]Let's see you do it.
[150:49.67]Oh.
[150:59.27]Go back?
[151:02.79]I think we're gonna fight a boss here.
[151:06.47]Boss imminent.
[151:19.09]We're saving this guy from learning the worst instrument.
[151:22.48]The drums are not the worst instrument.
[151:23.83]That's what I used to play.
[151:26.26]Did you?
[151:26.87]Yeah.
[151:29.24]Yeah, they're fine.
[151:32.00]I was just being...
[151:32.96]I was just being...
[151:35.05]The worst instrument.
[151:38.95]Everyone knows that's like a flute.
[151:43.50]I don't know.
[151:43.84]What is the worst instrument?
[151:49.34]Maybe the triangle.
[151:50.33]That's that's pretty bad, yeah?
[151:58.51]General,
[151:59.23]Maybe the kazoo?
[152:00.42]Is the kazoo an instrument or a toy?
[152:02.85]I just feel like, what's the skill ceiling on a triangle?
[152:09.32]You're gonna have to look up the craziest triangle player on YouTube who has 3,000 videos doing your favorite songs with a triangle.
[152:18.10]Is mayonnaise an instrument?
[152:19.36]Well, it could be if you, like, squish it.
[152:24.23]You walk faster if you crouch.
[152:30.52]One little strut there.
[152:34.42]Series crazy.
[152:38.48]The smoke detector is a good instrument.
[152:47.86]Well, that's a good thing to...
[152:50.17]Hold on, we got a boss incoming.
[152:51.54]We have to complete something.
[152:53.67]We got so stuffed by that other boss that we have to beat this one first try.
[152:59.13]You up for that challenge?
[153:00.30]I don't have any heals.
[153:02.58]You don't need them.
[153:05.31]Chiton!
[153:06.09]The Chiton are attacking!
[153:11.61]Only real triangle heads can play the forbidden note.
[153:16.65]True.
[153:19.35]Okay, I'm locking in for this one as hard as I can.
[153:27.94]The harmonica is bad?
[153:29.01]No, it is not.
[153:29.64]That's a great instrument.
[153:34.02]The harmonica is awesome because even if you don't know how to play it, you can just grab it and go like... And people go, holy shit, he's... Wow, dude, that's pretty sick.
[153:45.04]The harmonica is one of the only instruments you can pretend to play and be good at it.
[153:48.57]If with enough fake confidence.
[154:11.33]Dude, that move was long.
[154:14.63]Yeah.
[154:22.04]Strategic retreat!
[154:28.10]Yeah!
[154:36.19]Ow.
[154:40.08]Hurt him!
[154:47.56]There we go.
[154:48.50]We got this easy.
[154:55.12]Golden spear.
[154:56.63]Yikes.
[155:01.89]Think he's done?
[155:02.41]Yo!
[155:03.76]I think he's done!
[155:07.39]Well, enough guys, you've proven your strength.
[155:17.53]I'm so afraid to do anything.
[155:28.03]oh come on like full aggro
[155:40.72]Oh shit, he's doing the golden spear!
[155:42.29]Dude, that is hard to dodge.
[155:46.03]It's a huge explosion.
[155:51.14]You're doing great, hon.
[155:54.15]I need endurance.
[155:54.88]Oh, God damn it.
[156:03.34]Oh.
[156:12.73]Oh, believers.
[156:15.04]People are going to be like, oh my god, dude, I can't.
[156:16.87]They're overleveled for this fight.
[156:18.18]Why did I don't?
[156:23.43]You pressed attack a little early on that one.
[156:26.87]So I don't know.
[156:28.78]A lot more damage to get there.
[156:46.58]Hello
[156:56.47]I didn't parry any of that.
[157:09.78]I'm scalded.
[157:21.09]Yeah!
[157:30.77]Just kill him.
[157:38.37]Hey, we did it.
[157:40.73]Excellent work.
[157:46.26]Dropped a lime.
[157:56.69]Wait, is it actually phase three?
[158:11.14]Place begins to collapse.
[158:16.15]If you're so powerful, you have a phase three that causes a loading screen.
[158:29.50]cool that gave me like three levels by the way give me a small fortune
[158:43.72]Oh yeah, get all the goodies.
[158:44.71]Huge victory for believers.
[158:52.24]Actually, yeah.
[159:01.61]Well, I think that's a good place to stop.
[159:06.32]That's really fun.
[159:07.32]We didn't beat the scary boss, but it's OK.
[159:12.14]One day we'll beat him.
[159:13.19]One day we'll beat him.
[159:13.89]We are going to move on to, uh, Resident Evil 6.
[159:19.28]So do you need to go pee or anything?
[159:21.59]uh is that you asking for permission I mean that's I mean it's been about three hours
[159:27.09]Okay, bathroom break.
[159:28.64]Thanks for sponsoring Where Winds Meet.
[159:31.43]Yeah, Everstone Studio.
[159:33.81]From the toilet, anywhere you want it.
[159:35.94]It's been a lot of fun playing this.
[159:37.70]It actually has been very fun.
[159:38.74]A lot to explore in the world.
[159:40.55]I'm definitely going to be playing this on mobile.
[159:44.04]It's going to be my new mobile game, I think.
[159:45.93]Games free to play, it's on Steam, it's on Epic Games, it's on PlayStation, it's on mobile like we said.
[159:51.71]Uh, the whole thing's free to play as it seems like an, an unbelievable amount of content while being free.
[160:02.72]Again, we just did the co-op mode.
[160:04.24]You don't have to play in co-op.
[160:06.39]Maybe somebody is trickling in going, oh, is it like a, I have to do, you can do the whole thing alone if you want.
[160:11.21]You also can go into online mode.
[160:14.23]There's MIDI games you can play, cards, there's all kinds of little fun things to do.
[160:18.60]I don't think we even scratched the surface of what actually is in the game.
[160:22.51]But there's an entire section we haven't even seen yet, let alone the rest of the stuff here and whatever else is after it.
[160:33.72]But yeah, thank you again for the sponsor.
[160:35.74]Game's very fun.
[160:37.09]Go check it out if you'd like to.
[160:38.44]Links are in the pinned message.
[160:41.43]And, well, they were, but now they're in the panel as well.
[160:45.18]And I will see you in five minutes tops.
[160:49.07]And you can kill a goose.
[160:50.52]No, you can't.
[160:53.63]You're definitely not going to be able to.
[160:55.31]It's the most powerful enemy in the game.
[160:58.52]Good luck.
[161:00.24]Alright.
[161:00.54]Be right back.
[161:01.02]Thanks again for the sponsor.
[161:03.08]See you in a minute.
