[01:12.48]Don't worry.
[01:12.84]So we're going to have seven minutes to do this.
[01:16.72]Don't ask me why the ground is like weird color.
[01:19.49]I don't know what happened.
[01:20.25]Or like blew it up.

[01:48.50]It didn't come out right.
[01:51.70]Just keep it going.
[01:52.75]I hate to say this, but we gotta make the broom thicker.
[01:55.55]Yeah, well, make sure the broom, like, comes up and, like... So it's not just like... Oh, he's already ruined.
[02:05.81]I can't even talk.

[02:22.62]Oh, this is a really short broom.
[02:24.93]Well, yeah, that problem is way too short.
[02:26.33]What are you doing?
[02:27.99]I'm working on it.

[02:33.13]What am I doing over here?
[02:33.99]This is going to come out and then like this.
[02:39.35]It started off really weird, but it's got to be better.
[02:42.56]It's got to be even longer than that.
[02:45.17]Yeah, you gotta make it thicker, too.
[02:46.57]But hey, it's not about the size.
[02:47.85]It's the motion of the ocean.
[02:51.31]Here we go.
[02:52.25]We're making, like, a Lego spaceship, by the way.
[02:56.02]Okay, so... It needs to come up, like, a little bit like this.

[06:41.13]Is she holding a wand?
[06:42.03]I don't know what... Yeah, let's have her hold a wand.
[06:44.80]Is that a common thing for a witch?
[06:46.22]We don't have... Yeah, sure.
[06:48.54]Just do the... Oh, shit.
[06:52.06]Hold on, I'm not finished making her spiral staircase.
[06:55.32]Actually, this looks actually pretty cool.
[06:57.18]You see that?
[06:58.02]That's pretty good.
[06:58.78]We need red for the top.
[07:01.06]Here we go.
[07:02.46]No, no, no.
[07:02.90]Why?
[07:03.24]Why?
[07:03.44]Like that.

[07:07.00]But that arm is not... Yeah, this arm is not gonna... This is bad.
[07:12.34]Well... Can't the arm, like, sort of come from here?
[07:18.59]Yeah, I just don't understand, like, depth perception in Minecraft.
[07:23.69]Okay, so...
[07:25.60]Is her feet gonna be... They're not equally long.
[07:29.12]No, but that's alright.
[07:29.94]It's okay.
[07:31.24]So she's like a dude, like, trying to, like, cover her... Yeah, but shoot.
[07:34.78]I don't know about you, man, but you can't ride a broom if you don't hold onto it.
[07:38.33]She's, like, standing on it.
[07:41.17]Dude, this is the... This is the Statue of Liberty!
[07:44.41]Look at the feet, though.
[07:45.43]We made the Statue of Liberty!
[07:46.99]This is the Statue of Liberty!
[07:50.35]With a wart in her face.
[07:51.83]It's gotta make the crown.
[07:58.16]She's got to have at least one hand.
[07:59.44]This hand's got to be on the broom.
[08:00.62]We only have 30 seconds.
[08:02.08]No, no, no.
[08:02.60]We got it.
[08:02.98]We got it.
[08:03.26]We got it.
[08:04.74]So this has got to come down like this.
[08:07.44]And across.
[08:08.14]Why is the broom weird looking back here?
[08:10.56]I don't know.
[08:11.18]That's her thing.
[08:12.08]That's her thing?
[08:12.90]Oh, man.
[08:14.13]We only got 10 seconds.
[08:17.69]God.
[08:18.13]Well, we gotta make it pointy.
[08:19.03]I don't understand arms.
[08:22.39]Okay, so this could be... What is this?
[08:26.08]What is this thing?
[08:27.20]Dude, she's grabbing on.
[08:28.28]That's it.
[08:29.56]It's over.
[08:30.46]It's over.
[08:31.42]Oh my god.
[08:33.28]Hey, man, I think we did pretty good.
[08:34.68]This was part of my plan.
[08:36.94]This was part of my master plan.
[08:39.26]I like this.
[08:39.98]Hey, the wand thing.
[08:40.80]The wand thing.
[08:41.52]The red thing.
[08:42.16]That was icing on the cake right there.
[08:44.18]Yeah, the Statue of Liberty wand was perfect.
[08:47.18]That was so good.
[08:49.08]I feel like this is better than your bird.
[08:50.72]I feel like your bird is very, very blocky.
[08:52.94]Hey, the birds get like a big butt, alright?
[08:57.02]Yeah, big booty.
[08:59.74]Big booty.
[09:01.14]Alright, well, thank you guys so much for watching.
[09:02.94]Of course, you gotta give this thing a name and rating.
[09:05.94]And happy Halloween, everybody.
[09:08.20]Yeah, what does it say?
[09:09.54]Happy Halloween, or scary Halloween.
