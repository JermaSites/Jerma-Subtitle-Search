[00:01.21]Hey!
[00:02.87]Good afternoon.
[00:04.03]Hi, everybody.
[00:08.61]How's your day going so far?
[00:12.87]Mine's good.
[00:13.17]I'm a little heavy.
[00:14.99]Just a little.
[00:19.79]That probably needs some explanation.
[00:21.57]I feel like I have a softball in my stomach right now.
[00:25.79]Just a little heavy.
[00:27.21]You know, a little bloated.
[00:28.05]But it's okay.
[00:32.71]I've got some nice, uh... I've got some nice... tea here.
[00:40.19]It's not tea, it's coffee.
[00:44.27]The laxatives haven't kicked in yet.
[00:46.87]Well, that's the thing, they have.
[00:49.30]They have very much so.
[00:52.32]It's been very fun.
[00:54.80]But they're not even... Okay, I don't want to get into this.
[00:57.18]It's not like what you think.
[01:00.06]When you think of that word.
[01:01.74]Trust me.
[01:02.24]It's not what you think it is.
[01:05.52]There's like a... There's comedy.
[01:07.03]You know what I mean?
[01:07.55]Oh, comedy.
[01:08.15]Like, laxative.
[01:11.31]No.
[01:11.89]That's not what's happening.
[01:14.71]If you've seen any movie from like 1992 to like 1998, there was a... Uh-oh.
[01:17.01]Uh-oh.
[01:17.23]No.
[01:17.29]It's not like that.
[01:31.87]I mean, some of them could be.
[01:33.43]But this one isn't.
[01:36.85]I literally just joined.
[01:46.25]Anyways, that's a good way to start this stream.
[01:50.11]Why don't we bring in the two special guests?
[01:53.57]It's Star and Ashley!
[01:56.11]I think I said that before unmuting.
[02:00.38]I said start Ashley!
[02:01.72]Here they are.
[02:02.18]Hey, Ashley!
[02:12.00]I muted at the wrong time.
[02:13.16]I unmuted at the wrong time.
[02:19.37]But yeah, we're gonna do Trine.
[02:20.73]Trine 4.
[02:33.35]Wait, what?
[02:33.73]I thought- I thought this was three people.
[02:39.37]What?
[02:39.99]How does that- doesn't it break the game?
[02:41.21]Nobody has five friends?
[02:48.89]That's stupid.
[02:50.17]Once you get to Trine 6, it's 3v3.
[02:51.49]No.
[02:51.81]There's not that many people in the world.
[02:55.10]Trine- Trine, like, 6 is just like a 3v3, like, Dota game.
[03:00.36]Yeah, and the developers are pissed off about it because they want to make it, but they have to make Trine 5 first so that the joke works.
[03:08.61]So I remember we did this, we did a video on this.
[03:12.10]Yeah.
[03:14.06]Finally, I got to be in one of Steve's videos.
[03:16.54]That is one of the most popular videos you and I have ever done together.
[03:20.96]Yeah, I was just saying before this how recently, like today, I walked into a McDonald's and they were showing it on the screen.
[03:26.79]I couldn't believe it.
[03:28.03]Yeah.
[03:28.53]It's ridiculous, I know.
[03:30.27]That's weird because I was at Burger King two days ago and they were showing this video too.
[03:36.79]Really?
[03:37.41]Yeah.
[03:37.69]That's his joke.
[03:38.83]He just took that right from him.
[03:41.31]What the fuck?
[03:42.17]You can't do that.
[03:44.42]Steve, you can't let him do that.
[03:45.58]Well, okay, mine wasn't a joke.
[03:46.76]Is yours a joke?
[03:48.92]Or did yours also really happen?
[03:50.29]Just, like, just steal your joke in front of you.
[03:53.91]Yeah.
[03:54.81]Yeah, that's bad.
[03:55.71]That's just how we do it.
[03:57.03]Come on.
[03:57.91]Come on, Rowdy.
[03:59.07]Cut it out.
[03:59.90]Are we starting the game, Rowdy?
[04:01.04]Yeah, I'm ready.
[04:03.30]I'm ready.
[04:03.68]Okay.
[04:04.06]Okay.
[04:06.29]Okay, and by the way, my name's Kettlecorn.
[04:07.77]Call me Kettlecorn.
[04:08.42]What do you mean, Kettlecorn?
[04:09.14]My name is Frozen Butt-waiter.
[04:10.10]I love it.
[04:10.66]I got a sweet spot for, like, wizard voices.
[04:14.22]My volume's too loud.
[04:16.00]What if I hit escape button?
[04:17.58]He has waxes on his shelf.
[04:32.09]even if this box was located at a very inconvenient distance time to find that mailbox wait who does okay no I don't want wasd why are we all wizards I don't have a hat what why do I get ahead my controller's plugged in
[04:56.90]Why did they make me the pink one?
[04:58.26]That's offensive.
[04:58.94]This is the tutorial, you remember?
[05:00.50]You gotta play each hero one at a time.
[05:02.50]Yeah, but... Now we're all wizards.
[05:04.79]Remember when we were on the beach and... I know because I just saw this in the McDonald's.
[05:08.45]Wait, just... Wait, what?
[05:12.45]Hold left and... Okay, I'm ready.
[05:14.37]Right.
[05:17.40]So, get on the cube.
[05:18.22]Do I have to do these on screen to get them off the screen without A and D?
[05:23.35]Actually, we could just walk out the door, but I just walked in.
[05:25.33]Yeah, we have to walk out the door.
[05:27.99]Stop pulling at my box!
[05:29.25]What?
[05:29.65]Oh.
[05:30.97]Which one am I?
[05:31.39]Oh, I'm purple.
[05:32.03]Dude, I got the Twitch!
[05:33.17]I got the Twitch skin!
[05:37.17]I think it actually is.
[05:38.23]Zoom in.
[05:39.37]No, it's not.
[05:39.73]Is it?
[05:40.49]Zoom in.
[05:41.19]Oh, there is a zoom.
[05:42.03]I'm zooming.
[05:43.03]Is there?
[05:43.25]How do you zoom?
[05:43.87]Look at my shoulder.
[05:45.67]Jump.
[05:46.69]Hey, rowdy.
[05:48.55]What's up?
[05:48.91]How are you?
[05:50.41]Oh, I got a thing.
[05:51.49]Okay, that's how you do that.
[05:52.51]They nerfed the wizard, I was saying.
[05:54.61]Because normally, you draw a square, and the square appears there, but now it's always over your head.
[06:00.29]And also, if you jump on your own square, then you can't manipulate your own square for a duration after touching your square.
[06:06.37]You guys are... You guys are trining, aren't you?
[06:09.45]Yeah.
[06:11.11]A is jump.
[06:12.07]I've gotten that far.
[06:15.21]No, it's space bar.
[06:16.65]What?
[06:17.15]I have a controller.
[06:18.57]I have a controller.
[06:20.62]I don't care.
[06:22.28]A-W-A-S-A jump.
[06:26.41]Break the... Oh.
[06:29.19]There's instructions.
[06:30.45]He has to do this every time he leaves his home.
[06:32.75]That tree just keeps growing back.
[06:34.23]What about the secret up there?
[06:36.41]You gotta smash it.
[06:37.65]Yeah.
[06:38.59]Nice.
[06:39.39]So you get, what, three of these in a level or something?
[06:43.74]I think we all have to use our power at the same time.
[06:47.06]Not one person should be able to do this.
[06:48.98]Come on.
[06:49.94]If you weren't touching it, I think you could just lift it.
[06:52.07]Will somebody put a... Oh!
[06:53.97]Why is there a snowball in here?
[06:57.13]Uh-oh, we're losing him.
[07:04.24]We're losing him.
[07:04.86]Come on, Steve.
[07:06.38]Run.
[07:06.70]Hurry.
[07:07.60]Help!
[07:08.26]Get up.
[07:08.62]Highlight the levitation objects.
[07:10.32]LT and then switch targets.
[07:12.04]Okay, so if you... I got it.
[07:14.70]Help!
[07:15.87]I'm trying to give you my box, but it doesn't fit through.
[07:18.58]Alright, somebody lift that and stick it in the way like the traffic game.
[07:21.60]Good work.
[07:22.74]Help!
[07:23.28]Help!
[07:26.60]Here, here's the secret technique.
[07:31.05]Take it off!
[07:32.11]Get off!
[07:35.35]That's pretty big.
[07:36.51]No!
[07:37.11]You guys are doing the centipede from Super Mario Brothers to me.
[07:39.89]Get this out of here.
[07:42.55]Thank you.
[07:44.03]I'm so good at balancing snow.
[07:45.49]Wow, this doesn't look like it should be possible.
[07:50.92]Aww.
[07:52.72]When is it gonna come to life?
[07:53.98]The game looks good.
[07:56.86]It's like, starts screaming.
[07:58.80]Yeah, I know.
[08:00.50]It's a very nice looking game.
[08:05.57]Well, I turned my graphics down all the way so it looks like a mobile game.
[08:08.85]You can do it, honey.
[08:11.35]I did it.
[08:13.41]So we're going to have to go through each chapter as the... The first level is going to be each character.
[08:18.09]Yeah, it makes sense.
[08:19.06]Okay, you can rotate.
[08:21.02]Oh, alright.
[08:22.36]That's cool.
[08:24.58]I'm the wizard.
[08:25.42]I've always been the wizard.
[08:26.74]And I'll continue to be the wizard.
[08:29.38]We have assigned roles.
[08:31.14]If you put weight on something, it falls.
[08:34.76]Yeah, they nerfed the wizard.
[08:37.36]But if you go fast, it doesn't matter.
[08:44.26]There you go.
[08:45.78]I think we need one of those.
[08:48.54]How did you get a... I guess I think we're supposed to use that here?
[08:52.18]Nah.
[08:54.40]But it's okay.
[08:56.21]Again, I stress, this is his trip to his mailbox every day.
[09:00.63]Alright, this is a puzzle.
[09:02.59]We work together with our brains.
[09:10.06]Stick that up.
[09:12.74]Wait, did you already leave?
[09:14.01]Yeah, I'm out.
[09:15.45]Aren't we supposed to be doing puzzles together?
[09:17.27]You're just, like, jumping.
[09:18.57]What?
[09:18.67]There wasn't a puzzle.
[09:19.75]You just make a box and climb.
[09:22.97]You come up here, you make a box.
[09:28.74]No!
[09:29.14]Fuck.
[09:30.76]I'm behind the stage.
[09:31.38]That's not a puzzle.
[09:32.90]I thought this was... Yeah, I know.
[09:35.62]Okay.
[09:37.22]Okay.
[09:42.56]Oh.
[09:44.74]We can't- oh.
[09:46.28]Hold on.
[09:46.70]Did I just like push you off the level?
[09:48.74]I'm Donkey Kong-ing her.
[09:50.44]Nope.
[09:52.13]Hold the box still so I can jump on it.
[09:55.89]Thank you.
[09:56.49]Did you lose your hat?
[09:58.31]I never had a hat.
[09:59.27]What?
[09:59.45]From the beginning.
[10:00.31]We're the same guy.
[10:01.07]We're the same guy.
[10:01.81]Okay.
[10:04.03]Conjure a box.
[10:11.38]I think we should probably just all make a box.
[10:14.06]And all use it together?
[10:18.24]Same hat.
[10:19.30]Secrets!
[10:19.66]Secrets!
[10:20.32]Use the box!
[10:23.89]I didn't think he would get those secrets.
[10:29.37]Oh, I know what to do!
[10:30.45]No, no, please let me do it!
[10:31.27]Please!
[10:32.07]Please!
[10:32.39]Okay, so the box goes... Okay.
[10:36.53]Just do it.
[10:37.13]Just do it.
[10:37.43]I know you're gonna do this.
[10:38.29]Just put it in there.
[10:41.02]I figured it out!
[10:42.00]Wow!
[10:42.44]No, you didn't.
[10:43.12]You didn't fucking figure it out.
[10:46.36]I figured it out.
[10:53.73]Oh, is it a launcher?
[10:54.65]I think it's a launcher.
[10:57.19]I think it's a weir.
[11:03.23]Is it a weir?
[11:08.20]Why is that snow glowing?
[11:10.40]Why is that snow glowing?
[11:11.96]Can you break it?
[11:16.58]I can't, like, scrape it off?
[11:17.94]Like an ice scraper?
[11:19.70]Alright, we'll see.
[11:20.78]Alright, jump on this.
[11:22.20]And then, yeah.
[11:23.24]Oh no.
[11:27.75]We need to wait over here.
[11:28.51]As long as I can put it.
[11:30.71]Alright, ready?
[11:33.81]Nice.
[11:34.43]Now I have to do this.
[11:39.19]Wow, look at us, the free-triners.
[11:40.77]We are very athletic.
[11:42.11]Secrets over here?
[11:46.81]Kill it.
[11:49.00]Kill it?
[11:50.04]Hey.
[11:50.44]Wham!
[11:51.54]Wham!
[11:54.42]Go forward!
[11:57.60]What if an alien just, like, flew their spaceship next to your window and just leaned over to their friend in the cockpit and just said, Kill it!
[12:07.57]Wow, Ashley, oh my god.
[12:09.10]You guys... Come on, guys.
[12:11.28]I thought you were gonna, like, lift me up over to the ledge, but I was wrong.
[12:16.42]Oh, no.
[12:17.50]What?
[12:17.78]Why?
[12:19.16]I don't know.
[12:20.28]Ooh, it's like a snake.
[12:22.14]Attach!
[12:22.62]Attach!
[12:23.68]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:24.54]I have to... Whoops.
[12:25.24]Come on, Rowdy.
[12:33.74]Wait, I'm gonna grab this thing.
[12:35.89]Yeah, you gotta hook it over the woods.
[12:37.95]Alright, so somebody then has to stick it there.
[12:42.25]How do I hook it?
[12:43.33]She's blocking you.
[12:44.65]I can't hook it?
[12:45.83]You're just gonna have to run.
[12:46.89]I can't move this thing back.
[12:47.97]Hold on.
[12:49.47]I gotta, like, hook it right here, right?
[12:51.83]It's not hookin'.
[12:53.48]Okay, well, I'm just gonna do this.
[12:55.44]Just stay there.
[12:58.54]Okay, it's hookin'.
[13:01.26]Just jump over it.
[13:02.54]Wait, I got you guys.
[13:03.54]I got you.
[13:08.37]This is a wire.
[13:09.29]Rowdy.
[13:14.31]The glowy snow is sticky.
[13:15.37]Nice.
[13:15.57]He does that every time I have to go to my mailbox.
[13:35.94]Somebody said, oh great, another pretending to mess up puzzle stream.
[13:39.24]We're like speed running this level.
[13:42.32]We haven't even attempted to do a puzzle.
[13:44.19]Look at how fast we're going.
[13:46.83]That hasn't even been an attempt.
[13:48.27]Yeah, we're kind of too powerful.
[13:53.61]Oops.
[13:54.09]Did I get it?
[13:54.60]Got it.
[13:59.52]Oh, I did the Ster thing.
[14:03.04]Wow.
[14:04.22]Jump on the box and drop it.
[14:05.30]I already beat this level in my mind.
[14:07.10]No, you didn't.
[14:08.96]Yeah, you did.
[14:10.12]There's something down there.
[14:12.62]There's two of us down here.
[14:15.02]Get up here.
[14:15.46]I'm getting boxed in.
[14:17.00]Here, take it.
[14:20.12]Ooh, nice.
[14:21.20]Thank you, Taylor Swift.
[14:22.18]It's a daisy.
[14:22.79]It's a daisy.
[14:24.92]Bring it.
[14:26.45]I'm bringing it.
[14:27.69]You bring it.
[14:29.27]We got our mail.
[14:30.27]Oh, I got my mail!
[14:31.73]What's it say?
[14:33.01]Fucking evicted.
[14:36.97]We require you for a mission of the utmost urgency.
[14:44.01]Of Disneyland.
[14:45.19]Two years ago.
[14:47.27]You must find the missing Prince Selyus, a ward of the Astral Academy.
[14:52.95]He has vanished under mysterious and troublesome circumstances.
[14:57.67]Me?
[14:59.55]Too unpredictable to learn spellcraft.
[15:03.48]Edge Lord.
[15:04.32]I am going to learn magic.
[15:16.50]Constant conflict.
[15:18.00]Yeah.
[15:28.40]He turned himself into a snail.
[15:29.44]I bet he did.
[15:32.63]A snail?
[15:33.15]He's missing, but he's actually under that table.
[15:35.49]The second of our enchanted heroes was Pontius Knight.
[15:40.19]Just before the quest was about to begin, Pontius was out and about with his duties.
[15:46.95]And to that end, he was headed towards the derelict manor that once belonged to a recently departed knight.
[15:58.91]I remember this guy.
[15:59.61]You get to wear his hat in TF2.
[16:01.39]I don't even know what you just said.
[16:03.55]What did you say?
[16:04.75]You get to wear his hat in TF2.
[16:21.94]you actually do.
[16:23.40]Yeah, you buy Trine, you get his hat.
[16:25.78]Wow, that's a PogChamp, man.
[16:26.54]From back in the time where every single Steam release had a TF2 hat tie-in.
[16:30.91]Whatever happened to that?
[16:32.79]You can ride pumpkins.
[16:33.61]Why are you guys pushing me?
[16:38.77]No, it's not a speed fun stuff we have to pretend to mess up puzzles Oh shit wait, can we all smash what all I've wanted is this
[17:03.29]You didn't get the thing.
[17:04.19]You didn't get the thing.
[17:05.13]What thing?
[17:06.29]Do you really want to get the things in the tutorial?
[17:08.03]Who cares?
[17:08.65]Yeah, can we all smash?
[17:12.42]Whoa!
[17:14.06]Stomp on the... Wait.
[17:15.50]Oh, you jump and there's a Yoshi stomp.
[17:21.15]Do you remember this now?
[17:33.05]You can't make a block, you gotta smash.
[17:34.79]Well, where's the wizard?
[17:37.55]What?
[17:39.01]I need to be launched!
[17:45.30]Knock that wood over here.
[17:46.06]Try making it up now.
[17:53.53]No, I need this thing to launch me.
[17:56.57]Now you have to get launched.
[17:57.39]No, not me!
[18:01.33]No double bouncing!
[18:03.30]There you go.
[18:03.84]Okay.
[18:04.92]The secret was to do nothing.
[18:11.23]How do we get those?
[18:12.07]Ooh, that's out.
[18:12.69]Alright, go.
[18:14.87]I'll get them.
[18:17.43]What about over here?
[18:19.05]Hey, what about over there?
[18:20.15]Nope.
[18:21.43]Is there a sprint?
[18:24.76]You have to unlock it.
[18:26.18]You have to beat the game once.
[18:28.60]No, you don't.
[18:30.76]That'd be very strange if that were true.
[18:36.52]Okay.
[18:38.78]My controller unplugged.
[18:40.14]He's trying to create stream content.
[18:43.52]Break the ceiling.

[19:30.80]We can all bounce it.
[19:32.38]I can bounce it to you, and then you can bounce it back to me, and then we can make the triune.

[20:31.31]Oh, you're talking about me.
[20:37.05]We're getting it.
[20:40.39]We can make a tower.
[20:48.21]How am I supposed to... Drop the thing for me.
[20:50.20]Hey, drop the thing for me.
[20:52.44]It is.
[20:55.66]Drop the thing.
[20:56.26]So disrespectful.
[20:58.10]Hey, we're gonna get this.
[20:59.58]Projectile's gonna be blocked as well.
[21:03.64]Nice.
[21:05.08]Oh.
[21:06.26]It's come from behind, too.
[21:07.44]Stuff.
[21:09.10]Stop.
[21:10.82]He's trying to do this stream content.
[21:13.96]Alright, I'll go to the front.
[21:16.48]He's already bored of the game.
[21:18.63]No, it's funny when I do it.
[21:22.33]Yeah, that's how it always works, huh?
[21:27.07]And I remain.
[21:28.19]Okay, I'll go this way.
[21:31.23]How did I die up here?
[21:33.16]I killed you accidentally.
[21:34.04]I don't know.
[21:35.20]I'll do it back.
[21:35.82]Alright, I'll go forward.
[21:42.09]Okay, didn't know.
[21:44.56]We didn't know.
[21:47.70]No!
[21:48.06]God!
[21:48.56]Oh no, you were in front.
[21:50.68]Alright, I'll go forward.
[21:54.72]Wait!
[21:55.62]You have to wait.
[21:57.71]Okay, whoever, wait.
[21:59.45]No, stop!
[22:01.47]Whoever's in front, I'm gonna go forward.
[22:04.75]Go!
[22:08.75]Alright, somebody get across.
[22:11.16]You did it.
[22:11.58]Alright.
[22:12.90]I'll go up.
[22:22.02]I can't!
[22:23.16]If I put this down, I die!
[22:24.58]Steve!
[22:26.32]I'm gonna kill you too!
[22:30.47]Alright, we have to... No!
[22:31.61]No, you have to bounce it!
[22:32.71]No!
[22:34.35]You got it!
[22:35.35]You have to bounce it this way.
[22:37.19]Shoot one at me.
[22:39.53]Alright.
[22:40.45]I don't think you can reach from there.
[22:41.91]I can't?
[22:43.49]No, it won't reach from there.
[22:44.61]This one's tricky.
[22:50.56]Just, I'll die.
[22:51.30]Who cares?
[22:52.34]I'm good.
[22:53.08]Oh.
[22:53.82]He took it for the team.
[22:54.68]Worth it.
[22:56.14]Oh, let's go.
[22:59.57]Hey, I'm back.
[23:04.29]Oh no, it's the skeleton king.
[23:06.39]Is it a boss?
[23:07.31]Do they have bosses?
[23:09.77]Yeah.
[23:10.19]Do you remember the dragons?
[23:16.32]Do you remember this guy that we're fighting right now?
[23:18.30]I don't.
[23:23.14]Oh yeah, give him the light beam.
[23:25.48]Oh wait, then you have to hit his sword.
[23:27.08]Wow.
[23:28.84]It's the same way you could defeat me.
[23:32.20]Alright, how do we break that?
[23:39.60]Oh, he... Okay, that's how.
[23:45.32]He's in so much pain.
[23:48.36]Alright, I'll keep him there.
[23:53.23]You hit his back.
[23:54.23]DPS!
[23:54.37]DPS!
[23:54.61]Alright, we gotta break the thing up here.
[24:05.74]I'll keep him occupied.
[24:07.06]I think we have to... I have to bounce to... Alright, we have to do like a three or four person bounce thing here.
[24:18.28]Is that one?
[24:18.72]Come on, dude.
[24:22.92]How am I the only one that jumped on that?
[24:24.28]Alright, here we go.
[24:25.18]Oh, it'd be easier to do that from that side.
[24:27.24]Because then you just shoot it up.
[24:30.28]Shoot advantage for a moment.
[24:32.74]There we go.
[24:34.28]Gotta do it again.
[24:36.74]No, you don't.
[24:37.12]How do they live?
[24:40.22]Alright, kill him.
[24:52.05]Hard.
[24:52.45]Well, I have a note, too.
[24:57.67]Oh, is that... Okay, so I had to, as the wizard, destroy three trees and, like, a friend of Goat to get my mail, and he just gets it brought to him.
[25:06.57]How long?
[25:07.07]Okay, so this is Trine 4.
[25:08.91]How many years have gone by since Trine 1?
[25:10.39]I don't know.
[25:10.93]Use Google.
[25:11.81]Do we have a Trine story in the chat?
[25:13.67]2009. 2009.
[25:26.06]That's when the game came out, not how long has passed in the game universe.
[25:29.80]Oh, in the game universe.
[25:31.84]Yes, that's what I'm talking about.
[25:33.04]I thought you were talking about, like, when did they make that?
[25:35.64]No.
[25:36.50]Are you trying to figure out if the characters are still, like, bangable or what?
[25:40.61]Yeah, it'd be really funny if they switched to the archer and she was, like, in a grave.
[25:45.23]Oh, and what happened to our noble archer?
[25:50.09]Oh, oh.
[25:51.57]They gotta find another guy.
[25:53.83]Oh no, it's the archer section.
[25:55.18]You're the hardest one.
[25:56.36]Why did you do that?
[25:57.52]I'm scared.
[26:12.50]zoya was sneaking up oh she's the Assassin's Creed yeah I was gonna say is that is that a tie-in or is it just what it's a it's a tie-in is it is it actually entrepreneur yeah perhaps have chosen a door for their exit yeah um the makers of this game are friends with us aren't they the the prince guy that we have to stop is a templar to even notice one of them since the whole thing wait what do I do this character is kind of fun to myself
[26:38.41]This is your character, so pay attention.
[26:40.13]This is my character.
[26:41.63]This is your character.
[26:42.65]That's why I liked it.
[26:44.65]Okay.
[26:51.27]Some shampoo over here.
[26:52.69]Bath beads?
[26:53.79]No, they're definitely bath beads.
[26:56.39]Oh yeah, you have a grapple hook too.
[26:59.29]That's why this makes this character the hardest.
[27:02.57]So why do I have to have the hardest character?
[27:04.39]It's not the hardest.
[27:05.04]Because you're the best.
[27:06.91]I make a box, and you grapple to the box, and then I throw you into a pit.
[27:10.82]Don't you remember?
[27:12.04]Oh, now it's coming back to me.
[27:14.06]Yes, I do.
[27:14.60]Are we capturing the objective?
[27:19.08]I don't know.
[27:22.44]Yes, you have to capture it.
[27:25.60]Somebody has to stay in there long enough to open the door.
[27:27.32]Okay.
[27:30.12]Okay.
[27:38.34]You gotta let him learn.
[27:40.10]This is his only chance.
[27:42.14]He's never gonna.
[27:43.88]Let Rowdy do it.
[27:44.72]Are you guys talking about me?
[27:47.45]Yeah.
[27:48.57]Your little brother's gotta learn.
[27:51.05]I'm like four years older than you.
[27:53.67]Look how pretty this is.
[28:01.35]He's hitting me in the face repeatedly.
[28:04.32]No!
[28:04.76]I'm supposed to learn!
[28:06.10]Oh, you got them both and it's double.
[28:11.10]Speedrun.
[28:11.50]Woah!
[28:11.88]Alright, but seriously though?
[28:20.53]Like, you're not gonna get these?
[28:21.45]I'm making you do it.
[28:24.29]You do all the grunt work.
[28:25.31]We'll keep doing the level.
[28:35.83]Somebody has to pull this.
[28:37.94]I guess I'll do it.
[28:38.86]Yeah, you do it.
[28:39.68]Enjoy your date, guys.
[28:41.38]I'll just, like, do all this stuff.
[28:43.16]Bye.
[28:43.38]Let's go make out.
[28:45.80]Oh, hold on.
[28:46.26]We gotta... Rowdy!
[28:47.54]You have to help me.
[28:48.44]Uh-oh.
[28:54.31]Here we go.
[28:54.65]Alright, we need to look at this.
[28:57.89]Highlight... You can highlight targets.
[29:01.38]Okay.
[29:02.02]So, pull that.
[29:04.49]I don't know what I'm doing.
[29:06.04]You pull it and then you attach it to this so it stays here.
[29:09.42]Like, so you gotta pull that forward and then, then put it on the other thing.
[29:13.54]Oh, but the camera scrolls.
[29:14.62]There.
[29:16.34]There we go.
[29:17.32]Yes.
[29:17.58]Oh, shit!
[29:19.60]Come on, Rowdy.
[29:21.65]Oh, you can walk on it.
[29:23.23]Oh, neat.
[29:23.61]Come on, Rowdy.
[29:25.39]Well, you guys all ran away.
[29:26.55]Oh, can I interest you in the dessert menu?
[29:40.57]Are you excited?
[29:43.59]Yeah.
[29:46.60]I just realized what you were doing.
[29:49.46]Please.
[29:51.94]Don't bully.
[29:55.62]You fucking guys are so bad at this game.
[29:57.30]Like, I'm missing tonight.
[29:58.90]What?
[29:59.10]We're doing it so fast, though.
[30:01.00]How can you call us bad?
[30:02.62]It wasn't me.
[30:03.76]It wasn't me.
[30:05.22]It wasn't me that said that.
[30:07.82]Oh, your chat.
[30:09.44]I'm getting it.
[30:11.08]It's been long enough to make references to Spider-Man movies.
[30:15.18]Oh, oops.
[30:15.90]Uh, yeah.
[30:18.00]There's another room over here with a mystery box, guys.
[30:20.55]Mystery box?
[30:22.07]Guys, there's a mystery box over here.
[30:24.49]Ooh.
[30:28.03]Whoa, nice shot.
[30:28.85]Oh, Rowdy!
[30:29.61]Fuck.
[30:32.69]Yay!
[30:35.22]Oh, and he went in the tank.
[30:38.27]Oh, dude, that happened to me.
[30:41.04]It's a teddy bear.
[30:41.74]I see.
[30:42.92]I can relate to that stuffed animal.
[30:46.36]Alright, so now we need to do, uh, ropes and bridges, too.
[30:49.48]So, go on.
[30:51.16]Yeah, I think we're doing one at a time.
[30:53.78]And then I gotta capture the flag.
[30:55.18]Oh, wait, hold on a second.
[30:58.66]I can, like... That's kinda cool.
[31:01.28]Oh, shit.
[31:01.60]Well, no, now... Now I detach it.
[31:05.66]Okay.
[31:07.50]He's learning.
[31:08.54]Yeah, that's cool.
[31:10.70]That's cool.
[31:18.90]Alright, now attach that.
[31:20.78]Attach that.
[31:23.98]To that.
[31:24.30]Okay.
[31:26.82]Now I can let go of this.
[31:28.72]No, you can't.
[31:30.22]It's a bridge.
[31:30.81]Yep.
[31:31.03]Okay.
[31:31.35]Oh, now you can let go of it and climb up.
[31:38.03]You gotta be quick Balloons Nope Drop down B That's a huge cat Yeah Should we ring the bell?
[32:09.41]You have to, so that the hunchback comes out.
[32:12.92]Alright, well, open the thing.
[32:16.38]Alright.
[32:20.78]We did it.
[32:21.12]I don't know how we did this, but take it.
[32:26.44]Ugh!
[32:27.08]Ugh!
[32:27.34]Get out of here.
[32:29.62]In exchange for the stolen painting, Zoya received a purse full of gold.
[32:34.85]Oh, we're a mercenary thief.
[32:37.91]Yeah.
[32:38.90]Jerma's the bad guy.
[32:39.96]Well, that was weird.
[32:49.80]Get it?
[32:51.58]Almost.
[32:52.84]I get to be the first.
[32:53.62]Oh, fuck.
[32:55.06]I thought it was the other guy!
[32:56.24]I'm gonna do that a lot.
[32:57.94]I'm the one with the stirrup of them.
[32:59.76]I'm the one without a hat.
[33:02.10]Maybe the masquerade can cheer me up.
[33:06.78]Extremely hapless, like a new TF2 player.
[33:09.91]No!
[33:10.39]Alright, so then attach to this.
[33:12.13]Yeah, I think you gotta wrap it all the way around.
[33:14.55]Do I?
[33:16.09]I can't go that far.
[33:17.83]How did you get up there?
[33:19.23]I just jumped up here.
[33:23.32]Okay, then... Right, so you gotta... Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[33:30.78]Because I was already attached to it.
[33:32.58]Oh, there's one on the floor.
[33:33.92]Yeah, it's this one here.
[33:35.28]But why can't...
[33:39.05]Hold on.
[33:39.69]I still gotta pull it.
[33:41.25]Don't... Unattach.
[33:42.89]Unattach.
[33:44.19]Okay, everybody unattach everything.
[33:46.72]Please, stop!
[33:47.86]Stop!
[33:48.94]I'm not moving.
[33:49.54]There's too many assassins.
[33:50.88]I was about to ask, who's rowdy?
[34:01.19]Don't do anything.
[34:01.83]Let's start it.
[34:03.05]I'm so bad at this.
[34:06.07]Hey, are you Brad?
[34:07.13]What?
[34:10.76]It's an old meme.
[34:11.56]Alright, so if you go... I don't think that's what we do.
[34:18.37]I think... We had to do that before, and it wasn't working.
[34:21.55]But what if we... Unless one per... I think one person just do it, and then there's a lever on the other side.
[34:29.74]There is a lever on the other side, so I think somebody just runs it.
[34:32.42]Just go.
[34:33.76]Oh, and then you can.
[34:34.50]Yep.
[34:34.90]Yep.
[34:37.75]I'm trying to outthink the thing.
[34:38.63]Oh, you make the bridge.
[34:39.95]Yeah.
[34:40.75]Somebody said to make bridge.
[34:43.13]That makes sense.
[34:43.83]It worked.
[34:44.75]Yeah, we were overthinking that.
[34:48.34]Stop thinking.
[34:50.96]Dude, we already have 72 drops of virgin blood.
[34:55.82]I just was gonna say it was like simple syrup and red food coloring, but you fucking psycho.
[35:03.34]While she was on her way to the masquerade, Zoya happened upon a place that brought back memories.
[35:11.97]The town's orphanage.
[35:14.83]72 drops of Jerm of blood.
[35:19.50]What's your blood doing all over the trine world?
[35:22.50]I don't know, that person's also fucking psycho.
[35:28.12]Oh, she stole the paintings so that she could fund the orphans.
[35:35.24]The orphans.
[35:36.70]Dear Zoya, prestigious hero, savior of the kingdom.
[35:42.33]We need you to bring Prince Selyus back to the care of the Astral Academy.
[35:48.53]Bees.
[35:49.19]There's bees everywhere.
[35:52.42]That was funny for like one second, then he stopped doing the thing that was bees everywhere.
[36:19.18]Oh, he's dead.
[36:20.66]He killed Disney.
[36:21.40]What happened?
[36:22.06]Whoops.
[36:22.52]He's talking to MLC stealth.
[36:24.06]What?
[36:49.64]Beginning of level.
[36:51.74]Go.
[36:55.00]Many letters sent by the Master Wizardess directed our three heroes to a rocky and wind-beaten heath.
[37:02.61]Oh, it's for... There.
[37:03.85]Yeah.
[37:04.75]I thought it was in... I got confused.
[37:07.43]So do we get to pick our characters, or is this just who logged in first?
[37:10.77]At last, the enchanted heroes of Trine are together again.
[37:17.29]Oh.
[37:18.35]What?
[37:18.79]Okay, we're officially our rolls.
[37:22.93]Are we our rolls?
[37:24.05]Now we have to roleplay.
[37:28.80]Can you stand on my box when I hold my box?
[37:31.04]Ow.
[37:31.50]No, they nerfed the wizard.
[37:33.76]Sorry.
[37:37.92]No, stop.
[37:38.56]I was practicing.
[37:39.44]It's called the head swirl, where you see how many head flips you can do when you drop it.
[37:44.80]Two is, it's very hard.
[37:47.45]I'm gonna try.
[37:48.11]Yeah, see me when you get 100 super jumps, buddy.
[37:51.25]That's not that impressive.
[37:52.83]That's the end game.
[37:54.09]I don't want to rush you guys there.
[38:01.77]Oh, nice job Rowdy.
[38:02.83]Yeah, thanks.
[38:04.73]You coming Rowdy?
[38:06.36]Oh man, nice slam.
[38:07.76]Wow, nice.
[38:08.64]Oh, dead.
[38:09.40]I'm dead.
[38:12.30]I can get that.
[38:13.12]Those are spikes.
[38:16.86]Everyone's doing so well right now.
[38:18.80]I know, really.
[38:19.34]Wow, really good.
[38:23.51]Really good.
[38:24.05]I can't tell if he was trying to kill me.
[38:25.65]Because I think he's trying to kill me.
[38:27.15]He's probably muted so that he can tell people about his dark fantasies.
[38:30.37]Was I muted?
[38:30.89]How long have I been muted for?
[38:31.79]Probably like an hour.
[38:33.23]Hey, we missed blood.
[38:35.42]Everyone's freaking out.
[38:38.26]We didn't miss any blood.
[38:39.86]Yeah, we did.
[38:40.20]Right here.
[38:40.58]Well, we haven't gone yet.
[38:43.85]Oh, hold on, we need my ass.
[38:45.47]Oh, smash.
[38:46.09]You gotta break it.
[38:47.22]Yeah.
[38:48.36]Wait, wait, at this point, do you have this upgrade points?
[38:51.30]Yeah, you can... Wait, you can?
[38:53.54]Tab.
[38:54.42]What the heck?
[38:55.90]Oh my god, there's a skill tree.
[38:57.08]Oh my goodness.
[38:57.69]There's always been skill trees.
[38:58.99]I don't remember.
[39:03.27]Starting skill?
[39:05.79]Next upgrade.
[39:06.99]Hey, Ashley, I have officially replaced you.
[39:08.86]Oh yeah?
[39:12.48]My box is as good as you are.
[39:13.90]Okay, greater damage to enemies, or... a quick roll.
[39:20.32]Oh, now I'm more annoyed.
[39:25.74]Quick roll.
[39:26.16]How do I do it?
[39:27.76]There it is.
[39:31.96]Ooh!
[39:32.68]Yeah, that's my new- that's my new ability.
[39:35.54]It's Sonic the Hedgehog over here.
[39:37.34]Actually, you go pretty far too.
[39:40.69]You guys need that?
[39:41.21]Do you guys need a bridge?
[39:43.12]Let me know when you need a bridge.
[39:44.10]I'll be useful.
[39:44.62]No!
[39:46.42]Rowdy touched it.
[39:47.38]Despite not needing it, Rowdy really made sure to drop it on you.
[39:50.68]What?
[39:53.00]I didn't do anything.
[39:53.48]Once someone touches it, it falls.
[39:56.97]Uh, but what are you gonna do?
[39:57.95]I'm gonna do the same thing.
[40:01.09]Wow.
[40:02.71]Excellent work, everybody.
[40:03.83]We need a box.
[40:10.76]But hold on a minute here.
[40:12.64]There's, yeah.
[40:14.83]Can you lift that box up a little?
[40:16.61]You can't if you're on it.
[40:17.65]Jump on my shield.
[40:18.95]Oh, wait, yeah.
[40:20.05]Oh, teamwork, dude.
[40:21.63]Wow, look at this.
[40:23.31]Look, that's a super.
[40:25.45]Oh, my God, that's a super.
[40:29.19]Shoot it.
[40:34.10]Oh.
[40:34.52]Super.
[40:35.46]Wow.
[40:36.62]This game's kind of fun.
[40:40.26]Oh, I think you might have to get it to touch this thing down here.
[40:48.25]Do we have to swap characters?
[40:50.93]No, there's no swapping allowed.
[40:53.72]No swapping allowed, no matter what.
[40:56.50]I mean, it is allowed, but both packed.
[40:59.50]No swapping allowed.
[41:00.44]Well, what do you want to do here, then?
[41:03.20]I don't know.
[41:07.03]I don't know.
[41:14.65]You should be able to do everything with only one person.
[41:17.35]Okay.
[41:18.70]Oh no.
[41:19.72]What about... Can you block?
[41:21.20]Is this big lever up here?
[41:22.96]Yeah.
[41:23.36]No, there has to be something with this mechanism up here.
[41:30.98]Yeah, maybe that drops the mechanism.
[41:35.41]Maybe when you actually shine the light in there, it... Oh, I might.
[41:39.73]Yeah.
[41:44.88]Alright, what if you... What if you... Wait, wait, hold on.
[41:47.01]What if you stand on the box?
[41:49.23]Like, put the box here.
[41:50.49]Can you, like, stand and bounce it?
[41:55.01]Hold on a bit.
[41:58.42]There you go.
[42:00.10]Like, can you do it from there?
[42:01.98]No.
[42:08.74]Hmm.
[42:12.53]Hmm.
[42:15.69]That's not how light works.
[42:17.23]We gotta, like, a physics assistant.
[42:22.80]What if you jumped down and aimed, like, as you fell?
[42:28.14]No, that's still... Whoa, wait a minute.
[42:31.30]What if you did this?
[42:34.73]Stand on my thing.
[42:38.32]It's not that I can't... It's that I can't reflect it backwards.
[42:44.98]It just runs faster than light.
[42:46.93]What if I do it the other way?
[42:47.81]Can I attach another way?
[42:50.29]Wait a minute.
[42:52.67]Hold on.
[42:54.27]Let me move you down a little.
[43:00.34]If you were standing right above it, wouldn't you get it?
[43:03.50]Maybe.
[43:03.82]Right there.
[43:06.24]Right around there somewhere.
[43:10.10]There's an angle.
[43:14.16]Oh!
[43:15.25]Hold on.
[43:18.55]No.
[43:20.47]I don't think there is.
[43:21.63]Remove box.
[43:24.43]Get rid of the box.
[43:24.95]Alright, now do it.
[43:31.60]No.
[43:33.94]Still wants to go that way.
[43:35.70]Damn it.
[43:36.10]Hold on.
[43:36.82]What if I go here?
[43:37.34]Does it reflect off of the metal above you?
[43:39.42]Oh, it's so close!
[43:42.10]Hold on, let me, can you like, skate on it from here?
[43:44.76]Whoa!
[43:50.08]Look at that!
[43:53.53]Come on, that should count, game.
[43:55.41]Oh!
[43:55.93]I see it like, lighting up.
[43:56.59]It briefly is counting.
[44:00.93]It's so close.
[44:04.94]Ugh.
[44:05.16]And we can't stand up there.
[44:08.20]Oh!
[44:08.34]Oh, darn it!
[44:10.61]That's some shit.
[44:11.37]We did it.
[44:12.31]And it's not how you're supposed to do that.
[44:14.63]Nice work.
[44:15.69]What do you think about this question?
[44:18.51]I need to, like.
[44:19.71]What's so urgent about getting this boy back to the academy?
[44:22.41]Is this?
[44:23.01]Maybe they worry about him getting back now.
[44:26.27]Oh, sorry.
[44:26.55]I guess I just ride this.
[44:28.77]Oh, he could run into trouble out there in those old ruins.
[44:32.64]Come on, Rowdy.
[44:33.68]I have to do it.
[44:34.28]I can only get there by riding this.
[44:40.64]Come on, Rowdy.
[44:41.30]Oh, wait.
[44:41.60]Okay, it's a bridge.
[44:42.64]Whoopsie.
[44:42.94]We both jumped over.
[44:44.31]Right, it's a bridge.
[44:45.07]Okay, you're right.
[44:45.77]Sorry about that.
[44:49.17]Sorry.
[44:49.45]I don't know why I thought that was in the same plane.
[44:56.35]Wait, what's up here?
[44:58.05]Secret?
[44:59.65]Potentially?
[45:00.41]No?
[45:01.29]I already went over there.
[45:02.25]Oh.
[45:08.08]Alright, we have another light thing to do.
[45:12.36]Maybe this one will be not as, uh, ridiculous as the last one.
[45:16.55]Where, where am I trying to... Uh, up here.
[45:19.45]Up, up.
[45:19.87]Straight up.
[45:22.75]Is this wall a thing here?
[45:24.23]A thing?
[45:27.87]Um, it looks, I don't know.
[45:31.00]I feel like we're missing something that can reflect the light as well as your shield.
[45:33.74]Can something else reflect?
[45:43.12]Well, I can't... I mean, I can do... this.
[45:49.46]I guess I can attach to your box and... I don't know if that helps at all.
[45:54.99]This again?
[45:55.71]No.
[45:59.41]No, it's just blocking the way.
[46:03.21]My forehead can reflect.
[46:04.53]Oh, get the fuck out of here.
[46:08.31]You motherfucker.
[46:13.42]I did... I did pick the mode where we can have multiples of each character, but I don't think that should matter.
[46:17.70]I mean, because this is... this is so easy to just Twitch.
[46:21.02]If the game doesn't change... Yeah.
[46:23.02]...as far as I was aware.
[46:23.94]And I don't know if I could change it at this point.
[46:26.38]Because I mean, yeah, I could just also do that.
[46:30.17]Just do that and instantly move.
[46:31.67]But... but I don't want to do that.
[46:35.21]There's a no switch mode.
[46:37.39]So there is a no switching characters mode.
[46:41.00]Yeah.
[46:42.12]Oh.
[46:43.21]But I don't think the game changes depending on whether or not you've selected that mode.
[46:48.41]The game... The game changes.
[46:50.85]I'm saying I don't think that it does.
[46:52.93]Well, that's what somebody just said.
[46:54.43]Like, I just watched somebody do this and the game does change.
[46:58.57]Really?
[46:58.97]Yeah.
[46:59.25]Apparently the game changes.
[47:00.51]There's less objects and stuff.
[47:02.85]How about if we go to main menu and I re-invite everybody and we see?
[47:05.95]Yeah.
[47:06.99]Let's do that.
[47:08.57]Wait, they're lying.
[47:11.31]Are they lying?
[47:12.25]We're confirming.
[47:13.35]Are they lying?
[47:17.38]It's okay.
[47:18.50]I made it.
[47:19.08]We could switch solely because I forgot in the beginning you all get to be the guys and I all wanted to slam.
[47:24.48]That's just like the old.
[47:25.57]That's all I want.
[47:26.25]That's like the old school.
[47:28.13]Yeah.
[47:28.91]Yeah.
[47:29.53]That's the one thing I wanted.
[47:31.53]Okay.
[47:31.79]So let me know when you're ready.
[47:33.55]I invited you guys.
[47:34.67]Okay.
[47:43.85]Okay, there it is.
[47:46.33]You're gonna trust his chat waaaay too much.
[47:49.55]No, no, I'm telling you, somebody had- people- people have, like, proof, apparently.
[47:53.97]This better not start from the beginning.
[47:57.53]Oh, I'm gonna fucking scream.
[47:59.95]Apparently there's video proof.
[48:02.07]Yeah?
[48:03.09]Oh my god, it's the whole thing.
[48:04.39]What?
[48:04.59]No.
[48:04.65]No, it's not.
[48:14.53]Hold on, hold on.
[48:16.41]I'm seeing if I can... It's not letting me change levels.
[48:22.23]It's like we never even did the other one.
[48:24.67]Because it's a different game.
[48:26.67]Or a different mode?
[48:29.81]Yeah.
[48:32.21]I knew this was gonna fucking happen.
[48:37.33]Speedrun!
[48:38.48]Anyone who just joined, you didn't miss anything.
[48:42.70]Oh no, but...
[48:45.04]But... But... We have to do them all.
[48:55.30]We have to do all of them.
[48:57.43]We'll skip the cutscenes.
[48:58.33]It'll be really fast.
[48:59.25]Okay, very fast.
[49:00.73]Very fast.
[49:04.67]Uh, you can just talk to your chat about, like... Life and stuff.
[49:07.91]You were driving down the road the other day and you had a coffee.
[49:11.11]No, no, no.
[49:12.08]I've had too many coffees.
[49:13.20]There's no more.
[49:16.53]In the world?
[49:17.27]There's no more.
[49:17.89]I drank them all, so I can't do those stories anymore.
[49:20.42]Uppy, uppy.
[49:20.98]I don't understand.
[49:23.18]The world has made more coffees and stuff.
[49:26.28]You would think.
[49:26.78]Are you swearing off coffee?
[49:30.54]Do you have, like, a heart condition now?
[49:32.64]I don't actually.
[49:33.58]I still can drink coffee.
[49:35.10]It's the one thing I still am allowed to do.
[49:38.85]You just... Nothing else.
[49:40.67]Nothing else.
[49:42.79]Sticky snow.
[49:43.25]What a miserable existence.
[49:45.23]all four boxes are the same color now oh my god that was a very genuine my god oh my god I just I just want to play the last time we played trying something like this happened too I remember it the whole like world screen that existed
[50:16.70]Oh, this is the hardest one.
[50:20.22]Stop bumping my fucking boxes.
[50:21.86]I'm just trying to get up there, like, fast.
[50:23.57]You know what I mean?
[50:24.03]I'm gonna solo this level.
[50:27.83]Oh, we gotta recollect all the things.
[50:30.03]It's only right.
[50:35.71]Got it.
[50:37.19]Just die.
[50:37.53]Just die.
[50:37.87]Die.
[50:38.09]Die.
[50:38.29]Just die.
[50:39.32]How do I die?
[50:39.96]There's no die way.
[50:41.24]You just get over here, right?
[50:42.04]You can just, like, teleport to me.
[50:42.88]I don't know how.
[50:46.83]Wait, we need these.
[50:49.89]All you have to do is reach the mailbox and it'll end.
[50:53.91]Just reach the mailbox, Darth.
[50:56.65]I'm doing it.
[51:00.83]I gotta go get my mail.
[51:05.90]Oh, poor goat.
[51:08.46]I can't believe we would do this again.
[51:11.96]Well, now we... Here, you guys collect the things.
[51:14.96]I'm going forward.
[51:19.10]I need another box.
[51:20.08]This is the try-hard sounds of keyboard clicking and silence.
[51:24.14]I need- I need weight.
[51:49.29]Waiting for other players to continue.
[51:51.05]I need you guys to activate the goat cutscene.
[51:53.29]What?
[51:53.61]What?
[51:54.57]No.
[51:56.50]I'm, like, stuck at this one thing.
[51:57.94]Fuck.
[52:00.06]No.
[52:02.30]Hold on, I'll get you.
[52:03.16]I'm coming.
[52:03.94]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[52:06.16]Maybe I should, like, disconnect.
[52:08.72]Oh, no, I got it.
[52:09.54]I, like, glitched out and I got it.
[52:11.50]Alright, good, because we need each other over here.
[52:13.00]Alright.
[52:18.50]Ugh.
[52:19.78]The speedrun is taking longer than the actual run.
[52:23.28]Yes.
[52:24.10]I mean, kind of.
[52:25.88]Sort of.
[52:27.28]Okay, now you stick that one on the sticky one over here.
[52:29.74]There's a sticky one here.
[52:35.50]$500 bounty on anyone who can figure out goat skip.
[52:38.99]Right there.
[52:39.55]So the snow is sticky.
[52:41.09]Now we need to weigh it down.
[52:44.43]Okay, so weigh this end down.
[52:48.85]Like this?
[52:49.95]Yeah, no, like over here, so we could jump to it.
[52:51.86]God, sorry that I did this one last time.
[52:58.38]How are you guys still back there?
[53:00.24]Yeah, we need to go down here.
[53:02.16]Go!
[53:03.08]What I- I- you're gonna- you're gonna be stuck here.
[53:06.78]You're gonna wear yourself down.
[53:10.74]Just jump off the map.
[53:13.20]There is no pit here!
[53:14.20]Just jump off the map?
[53:15.41]Are you not even to the fucking- the bridge thing yet?
[53:18.86]There you go.
[53:19.44]Alright.
[53:19.78]Now he's going to make it from here.
[53:21.18]I'm not a wizard.
[53:22.00]I'm a warrior.
[53:23.16]Your time to open up Sharma's stream to see where you're at so I can give my helpful tips and tricks for trying four.
[53:30.57]Wait, what happened?
[53:32.69]Okay, there you go.
[53:33.77]Now, there you go.
[53:34.43]Yeah, you got it.
[53:35.73]Yeah.
[53:36.17]Shut up.
[53:36.70]Shut up, chat.
[53:37.36]I don't want to hear it.
[53:39.98]I can ban you all, and I will.
[53:41.48]Alright, let's go.
[53:45.83]We're almost there.
[53:46.83]We've almost made it.
[53:47.70]Yes!
[53:48.32]Jabot!
[53:48.90]Wee!
[53:50.16]Oh yeah, right, we just died.
[53:53.82]Yes!
[53:54.70]Death warp.
[53:55.84]That's how you do it.
[53:56.84]Okay, now we need a goat.
[53:59.46]Goat?
[54:00.20]How do you activate the goat?
[54:02.38]Oh, there you go.
[54:11.94]Dude, this is taking longer than the last one.
[54:17.64]Why don't you guys just stay near a pit so that when I get forward you can... Yeah, but some of the stuff you have to have more than one person do.
[54:25.39]No, you don't.
[54:26.47]No, you don't.
[54:30.19]It's trying.
[54:31.75]You don't.
[54:33.33]Everything in trying can be done with one person.
[54:36.53]Oh, yeah?
[54:37.41]If you can character switch.
[54:38.55]What about the damn game mode we just played?
[54:43.25]Get those.
[54:47.29]Well, Jerma, we've already done this level.
[54:52.68]We got the letter.
[54:57.64]I'm dead.
[55:00.89]Oh, wait, we need... Alright, here we go.
[55:07.12]Where are you?
[55:10.28]Oh, it's spawning you back at the pit?
[55:13.20]Oh, shit.
[55:15.38]Well, I have a levitating device here.
[55:18.11]Alright, now I'm gonna do this.
[55:28.48]get it oh no you got it right there okay guys I figured I figured out how to do one person light reflect you picked the wrong skill there's a dream shield where you can leave an ethereal copy of your shield in place and so you picked the wrong skill and I think it was a bonus I think it was a bonus objective because we could continue without it can we just confirm I mean you already got the joke across everybody in chat is this real or was this just like a
[55:55.23]Like, did they actually have less objects in this mode?
[55:58.41]Now, you already got us, so... Might as well just come clean here.
[56:03.75]What?
[56:04.59]I'm just asking if this game mode thing is actually real.
[56:07.99]What?
[56:09.47]It's not.
[56:10.25]It's not.
[56:12.81]What's going on?
[56:14.21]I'm not doing this.
[56:16.79]You're doing it.
[56:17.89]I'm not doing this right now.
[56:19.56]What are you doing?
[56:22.44]I don't know how to start a game that's not at level 1.
[56:26.99]unless my character just like lagged out just I'm dying well no I'm actually somewhere where you can die and I'll be done I'll be done in two seconds
[56:46.30]Okay, I should teleport to you now.
[56:50.44]What?
[56:50.80]I don't know how you do this for a long time.
[56:54.64]Switch it to the PS1, quick.
[56:56.12]Yeah, it could work!
[56:58.56]Do you guys have this on PS4?
[57:00.26]We could switch.
[57:15.01]Of course, I bought a copy in every system.
[57:17.89]Same.
[57:20.51]That's how much preparation I put in for these streams.
[57:23.19]Aw, can I get some PepoDances in the chat, please?
[57:26.22]PepoDances?
[57:27.20]Oh no.
[57:27.64]This is going better.
[57:46.54]Uh, can we all agree, actually, that it was Ashley's fault?
[57:49.52]Why?
[57:50.53]Because she picked the wrong skill.
[57:52.73]Well, how would you pick the correct skill?
[57:55.97]I picked the first thing that looks like it wasn't locked on my screen.
[57:59.63]Bruh, how are you supposed to know that?
[58:01.51]Oh, it's her fault.
[58:08.91]It's virtually her fault.
[58:11.55]Dude, we're gonna have to talk about this after the stream.
[58:14.05]I feel, like, alright because we get to experience, like, the big, like, pog moment of when we get the HUGE one again.
[58:20.74]You know what I mean?
[58:21.34]Remember that?
[58:22.18]Yeah.
[58:22.38]I don't know what it means.
[58:23.12]Oh no, not this.
[58:37.82]Oh, yeah, I remember this moment.
[58:40.24]Okay, I'm forward.
[58:41.96]One, two, three.
[58:43.50]Why did you say go?
[58:46.19]Because it's a speedrun.
[58:48.37]Well... I'm backward.
[58:52.29]One, two, three.
[58:56.39]Got it.
[58:57.03]No, I didn't.
[58:57.35]I went too high.
[58:58.46]Alright, I'm blocking the... I'm just standing here.
[59:04.16]You just shoot it.
[59:04.72]Okay.
[59:11.18]Let's go.
[59:11.94]Yeah, let's go.
[59:12.98]Let's go.
[59:13.96]Oh, Pog.
[59:15.17]Let's go.
[59:16.97]Fuck him up.
[59:21.87]Again.
[59:25.09]Make sure he bounces it towards you.
[59:27.84]Get it.
[59:31.58]Bingo.
[59:31.92]Watch this.
[59:32.64]Got it.
[59:33.54]Immediately.
[59:34.56]Oh, wow.
[59:35.84]We're so good.
[59:41.16]World's first.
[59:42.02]World's first.
[59:43.00]Is that like six seconds?
[59:45.04]Skip.
[59:46.22]Skip.
[59:49.32]I almost just exited to the main menu.
[59:52.69]World's first, baby.
[59:54.71]It's gonna be really funny when we do this for every stage, even the ones we haven't seen yet, because we actually practiced this off stream.
[60:03.48]You know, actually, I was thinking, you can tell me what the scale of comedy this would be.
[60:08.68]I was thinking of, like, a long time ago.
[60:11.70]You know, like, Dark Souls 1 speedruns.
[60:14.26]Yeah.
[60:15.44]I was thinking, what if I just opened up Dark Souls and was like, you know what, guys, I'm gonna, like, play Dark Souls.
[60:21.09]This is before I even played Dark Souls 1, like, on stream, right?
[60:24.39]What if I practiced...
[60:27.11]the first, like, 12 minutes of, like, the Dark Souls 1 speedrun, and got it perfect, and just turned it on and started fucking going.
[60:37.52]I kinda did that with Dark Messiah, where I didn't say I was gonna speedrun it, and I just knew all the speedrun tricks.
[60:43.18]Yeah, but I'm talking, like, actual, like, you learned the actual route.
[60:46.60]Actual deception of your audience.
[60:48.80]Like, you hate them.
[60:52.84]Oh no, he hates us.
[60:54.42]Sad.
[60:55.42]Wait, wait, so I gave an example of me doing it and your counterpoint was no, but actually.
[61:00.21]No, no, there's a difference between I just play this game a lot and know some of the routes to I'm doing the actual like any percent route on Dark Souls 1.
[61:12.87]There's a difference between I know this game pretty well.
[61:15.85]No, no, I knew the speedrun route.
[61:17.87]I did the speedrun route.
[61:21.40]Was that the first time you ever played it?
[61:23.24]On stream?
[61:27.20]This is your joke, and you're not giving me credit for it.
[61:31.56]He didn't do that.
[61:32.48]Did he do that, guys?
[61:33.18]What a lonely, sad man.
[61:40.07]He didn't do it.
[61:40.57]Alright, hold it back.
[61:42.57]No, he didn't.
[61:43.09]I'm seeing a lot of no's.
[61:48.11]Dark Messiah doesn't have routes, is what people are saying.
[61:51.77]They're calling you out.
[61:56.55]Oh, this thing.
[61:57.15]Oh, here you go.
[61:59.95]You're not going to get the Jerm of blood?
[62:02.97]Those balloons have things in them.
[62:06.30]Now you agree it's Jerm of blood.
[62:07.74]Oh no, we fucked it up.
[62:13.18]Oops.
[62:14.66]No, we had it.
[62:17.01]You had to get the blood.
[62:18.49]But I was yelled at.
[62:19.65]Everyone was like, dude, blood.
[62:22.11]I get yelled at all the time living with this guy.
[62:26.37]Eventually you just learn to live with it.
[62:29.33]Now I'm gonna pull this.
[62:31.93]Okay, now you pull it.
[62:33.87]Now you make sure I can get across.
[62:35.95]Actually, I got it.
[62:40.19]He's actually not getting these.
[62:45.21]In the route, you get those, because you need to have at least 15.
[62:48.09]To get the special warrior skill?
[62:50.78]No, to get the one skill.
[62:51.82]Yeah.
[62:52.64]He thinks he knows the routes?
[62:56.54]This game has no routes.
[62:59.44]This is actually like... I really need these.
[63:02.60]Alright, whatever.
[63:03.20]Who cares?
[63:04.28]He's made the decision for us, apparently.
[63:05.75]Hey, Steve.
[63:17.06]Yeah?
[63:18.42]Yeah.
[63:18.78]I know.
[63:19.12]Why can't you be more likeable?
[63:24.90]Hey, uh, what if I happen to, I can do this all by myself, everything can be done alone?
[63:27.97]Well, I got here, I was doing everything by myself, and I was trying to figure out how to do that one.
[63:34.01]I'm sure there's a way.
[63:34.95]Actually, probably if you connected the rope on both of them, you could probably do it.
[63:40.14]A pleasure.
[63:40.66]Yeah.
[63:41.61]If I told you to open Dark Messiah up right now and do the first 20 minutes in a route, would you be able to do it?
[63:53.19]Um... Oh, shit.
[63:54.53]Yeah, I think I could.
[63:55.43]I think I could do it.
[64:01.69]Unfortunately, we don't have time for that.
[64:03.93]And Jerma, you think it's like, oh, you just didn't even... The beginning of Dark Messiah, one of the skips requires you to...
[64:11.57]Break- cutscene break, go out of like like the whole cutscene's happening and you're walking around outside of it.
[64:16.00]Then edge clip on the edge of the map, but pause the screen and while the game is paused you pause for an exact amount of time and then it launches you forward over a castle wall specifically into one exact window.
[64:26.00]And I did that without mentioning that I knew any of this and this is your joke and I can't-
[64:30.00]Why do you know this? Why did- why did you do that? Why did you- why did you play it on stream then?
[64:36.00]Just trying to prove how much better you are than everybody else?
[64:39.64]I love that game and I thought it was funny.
[64:42.64]It's your joke, you get it!
[64:44.92]You get why I did it!
[64:46.33]Skip!
[64:46.79]Skip the goddamn cutscene!
[64:52.63]Skip!
[64:52.97]Dark Souls is harder.
[65:03.96]Oh, no, no, I'm the wizard.
[65:05.48]Why am I the wizard?
[65:07.32]Players.
[65:12.61]Rowdy wants to switch with Ashley.
[65:14.35]What?
[65:15.03]What?
[65:15.33]No.
[65:15.51]No, you don't.
[65:16.33]How did I do that?
[65:17.41]You want to switch with me.
[65:18.47]How do we?
[65:19.07]I just pressed, like, R. I just pressed red.
[65:21.43]Okay, I pressed right bumper.
[65:24.17]Red rover.
[65:25.27]I was about to say red rumper?
[65:28.90]What?
[65:29.80]Right bumper.
[65:31.68]You got monkeys on the brain?
[65:33.28]I don't.
[65:35.80]Okay, remember to pick the right skill this time, Ashley.
[65:40.04]Redrum.
[65:42.72]Oh, murder on the branch.
[65:44.08]Oh, shit.
[65:47.13]Hold on.
[65:48.09]Alright, we're actually playing the game now.
[65:49.45]This is no longer the tutorial.
[65:50.51]We want to get the stuff.
[65:52.35]Let's get the- oop.
[65:55.17]I think you need to do the super launch, right?
[65:57.93]The butt launch on here?
[65:59.03]On the other side?
[65:59.45]Yeah, do the butt launch.
[66:00.43]Do the butt launch.
[66:01.47]Nice.
[66:01.79]There you go.
[66:08.41]Oh wait, I need those.
[66:09.05]We gotta go down, there's a lot of things down.
[66:12.57]Oh yeah, there is.
[66:15.95]And you gotta rope over here.
[66:17.24]Uh-huh.
[66:18.48]Yeah, this is what I'm frickin' talking about right now.
[66:21.04]Alright, now we have a level up.
[66:22.66]We got a treasure.
[66:24.94]Did we have a treasure before?
[66:26.86]Yeah, I got that before.
[66:29.11]None of you were up to my, like, I'm so far ahead of you doing the speedrun, doing the joke, not getting credit.
[66:34.50]I was thinking about this, like, new series on YouTube.
[66:36.74]You tell me if this is interesting or not.
[66:38.56]Where I, like, watch, like, a movie or, like, a TV show that it's, like, weird.
[66:43.29]And I make, like, a video that, like, breaks it all down and shit.
[66:46.57]But pog!
[66:48.07]Pog moment.
[66:48.65]Hold on.
[66:49.89]Shoot it.
[66:53.37]Don't want to break it.
[66:54.36]I got it.
[66:55.82]You're going to call the series, What Are You Doing?
[66:58.26]No, the series is going to call, like... Dude, what is this box?
[67:01.16]Where was this?
[67:01.95]This is called This Is Different Game Mode.
[67:03.85]We did not get debated by chat.
[67:05.09]It was real.
[67:08.05]Okay.
[67:08.71]Okay, well, go down.
[67:09.97]Go down here.
[67:10.49]Go to the bottom.
[67:11.81]Alright, we can do that.
[67:12.53]Oh, that works.
[67:15.17]I can't believe we cheesed it.
[67:17.45]It was up here the whole time where I was poking around before.
[67:20.71]Okay.
[67:20.91]What's so urgent about getting this boy back to the academy?
[67:24.89]Wait, stuff, yeah.
[67:25.82]Shoot them.
[67:27.84]Yeah.
[67:30.32]I'm mad.
[67:31.80]Hey, you picked the game mode.
[67:33.52]I did, and it's my fault, because I really just wanted us to all pound the ground, and we briefly did anyway.
[67:38.92]It was really important.
[67:39.76]Dude, look how many of these they give us.
[67:41.95]Yeah, this is a different game.
[67:43.39]Nice job, guys.
[67:47.45]Get off of it, Rowdy.
[67:49.84]I don't even need both of those.
[67:52.76]Doesn't even need them.
[67:53.54]That's offensive.
[67:55.12]Doesn't even need them.
[67:58.14]Ay-ya-ya.
[68:00.40]Okay, level up, but maybe don't level up.
[68:05.05]Alright, hit tab.
[68:07.13]I guess you don't get those till later.
[68:09.07]Yeah, you couldn't actually get dream shield.
[68:10.89]Dream shield?
[68:12.27]Oh yeah, I took the other skill because it was the only one that I could take.
[68:15.41]Thanks for blaming me for nothing.
[68:17.15]I can't believe Ashley would fuck this whole thing up.
[68:22.08]I mean, what are you talking about?
[68:23.50]Buying the lightning sword.
[68:25.32]Again.
[68:27.68]Here it comes.
[68:28.06]You found a new letter.
[68:28.94]I don't, I don't... We hope you have found the missing prince by now.
[68:32.35]Okay, you, you can read them, I don't wanna... If not, please be warned.
[68:35.47]Oh.
[68:37.55]What?
[68:37.93]When?
[68:41.17]Reading, reading the story in Trine.
[68:44.38]I mean, like... Really?
[68:47.68]Reading the lore snippets in Trine.
[68:52.25]That's the story of Trine.
[68:58.00]What a big bird.
[69:01.14]But wait, hold on.
[69:02.00]Yeah, because then I need to go down here and get these little gumdrops.
[69:08.51]No, Star, you cannot recreate the video.
[69:11.69]I'm sorry.
[69:12.25]I know.
[69:13.17]It was a funny video, but we can't just try to recreate it.
[69:17.66]That season already exists on TV.
[69:19.00]I should have dropped the whole thing.
[69:20.38]That was the real video inside us the whole time.
[69:23.82]Inside of you?
[69:25.02]Yeah.
[69:25.18]That's where the videos come from.
[69:27.58]Pepehands.
[69:28.38]Old.
[69:29.25]Old Jerma.
[69:30.43]Old Star.
[69:32.93]That video was like 2014.
[69:33.83]That's what everyone says is I miss the old star.
[69:37.47]Okay, I can attach to this.
[69:42.57]So, what does it want us to do?
[69:44.09]Stick it up there?
[69:46.38]Stop!
[69:47.02]Stop!
[69:47.46]Just for a second, stop it like we had it!
[69:50.00]I missed the old shot.
[69:52.60]I'm trying to recreate it.
[69:53.60]Alright, I get it.
[69:58.54]What about you?
[70:00.42]What about me?
[70:05.10]So, I got one attached, and now bring me up.
[70:08.86]When you are attached to it, I can't lift it.
[70:15.75]Just stand on the left and jump across, but don't attach.
[70:18.83]Oh, it was the explosions.
[70:20.37]It was the stomping that freaked me out.
[70:22.31]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[70:23.55]I'm giving you motivation.
[70:24.82]What is this?
[70:25.98]Monsters.
[70:29.08]Oh, you have to fight in this game.
[70:33.20]These are the things that stole the prince.
[70:34.58]Watch your step.
[70:39.79]For some reason they were summoning platformers.
[70:41.81]I don't know.
[70:43.45]There's magics at work.
[70:49.97]Magics?
[70:51.22]You coming?
[70:51.74]There's magics.
[70:52.66]Wait, why are we going over here?
[70:54.38]Because, why not?
[70:55.82]Oh, there is like a little spot to go.
[70:57.20]Do you have another place you want to go to?
[70:59.14]No, I mean, this is like a little secret area, I guess.
[71:01.72]I guess, man.
[71:06.00]Oh, I see.
[71:13.87]Wow, that's one tap.
[71:17.23]Okay.
[71:20.55]Why don't you just bring it over here?
[71:26.08]Yeah, maybe you go to the bottom.
[71:28.54]Yeah, you go down there, because then you can do it more... Can you make a rope for me to stand under?
[71:33.72]I can.
[71:38.95]I can give you the box.
[71:39.91]I mean, you can stand on that.
[71:44.20]Doesn't work.
[71:45.70]There we go.
[71:51.52]There we go.
[71:52.44]See?
[71:52.86]All three of us.
[71:54.46]That's a true trier moment.
[71:56.74]Another big one.
[71:57.32]There's a word.
[71:59.18]There's a word I'm gonna say.
[72:01.02]I can't.
[72:01.36]I don't know what it is.
[72:02.70]What?
[72:05.77]The chat's already doing it.
[72:06.53]It's fine.
[72:07.01]That's what it was.
[72:08.97]What was the word?
[72:10.07]I'm not in that chat.
[72:11.59]Say the word out loud.
[72:12.86]I don't know if I can right now.
[72:15.66]Nothing happened.
[72:16.28]Oh my god.
[72:22.31]Here.
[72:33.99]More of these under here.
[72:38.03]Cool.
[72:39.25]You gotta get the blood.
[72:41.59]Yeah, I did.
[72:47.84]You really are the, like, little brother, aren't you?
[72:49.80]Get off.
[72:50.40]Get off of it.
[72:50.82]It's mine.
[72:51.37]Get off.
[72:52.03]Don't touch.
[72:52.55]Get off of that.
[72:53.11]Okay.
[73:06.30]Yeah, I didn't like that one.
[73:07.76]I didn't like that one either.
[73:08.98]Somebody said, wow, you all suck.
[73:10.58]This place is a freak show.
[73:12.44]You fucking guys are so bad at this game.
[73:14.12]Like, I'm missing dinner now.
[73:15.00]I'm referring to your chat.
[73:16.62]I don't know.
[73:17.04]I don't know who you're talking about.
[73:18.98]The freak show, otherwise known as Jerma's chat.
[73:22.72]Yeah, the insane, the what a inhumane psychopath.
[73:28.18]You guys need this ball.
[73:34.11]True.
[73:34.69]What do you mean true?
[73:35.81]Alright, now if you do the super blast, you can launch the ball up.
[73:41.65]Here we go.
[73:42.69]There it is.
[73:43.75]Do it again.
[73:44.21]No.
[73:48.00]Oops.
[73:49.82]Oh, nice one.
[73:51.06]Do we even need that thing for now?
[73:54.08]Nope.
[73:55.48]Now we don't.
[73:56.04]I'm going to attach this to this.
[74:00.44]Or maybe not.
[74:02.72]Oh, it's just icy.
[74:03.45]I see.
[74:07.06]Oh.
[74:07.36]I got to jam this.
[74:10.17]Can you get off that block?
[74:11.87]You're what, buddy?
[74:12.85]Okay.
[74:13.07]You got... Okay.
[74:13.75]No.
[74:13.87]You got it.
[74:14.33]Okay.
[74:14.85]Okay.
[74:15.07]I wasn't... Yeah.
[74:16.03]Okay.
[74:16.95]Okay.
[74:18.57]I fucking love this guy.
[74:20.01]Jerma985, they call him.
[74:22.21]Dude, Steven needs a box!
[74:27.33]Steve!
[74:27.59]Steve, please!
[74:28.85]What?
[74:29.05]Have a box.
[74:31.67]Wait, what does that do?
[74:33.45]Does that, like, activate a button?
[74:34.81]If you press that?
[74:35.65]I don't know.
[74:36.95]Uh, it looked like you could pull the thing down.
[74:39.86]Guys, remember when we went to the trampoline park?
[74:44.60]Yeah, it was fun.
[74:46.12]And Steve split his pants.
[74:48.74]Oh yeah.
[74:49.90]I did.
[74:51.20]Whoa!
[74:53.86]Help me!
[74:55.42]I'm but a simple wizard!
[75:09.93]Does that help us?
[75:12.61]Well, it lets you do the thing to get up on the thing.
[75:17.14]But then you guys have to get up here, too.
[75:23.48]So how do you get up here?
[75:25.34]Uh... Do I need... Wait, I might have to do a... What?
[75:29.63]Okay.
[75:30.99]He's just a gamer, that's all it is.
[75:33.23]That looked totally wrong.
[75:37.73]Ow!
[75:45.10]Let go, Jarva.
[75:46.22]Do I?
[75:48.63]Yeah.
[75:50.19]Well, there's a little hook on it, so it makes me want to participate.
[75:52.56]You can go there.
[75:53.70]Where he's standing.
[76:02.63]Here we come.
[76:07.57]Smash.
[76:08.71]Yeah.
[76:09.81]Yeah.
[76:12.10]Smash is very satisfying.
[76:15.90]Dude, I just love smashing.
[76:17.48]Remember when Star spit on Jerma's pizza?
[76:19.98]What?
[76:22.00]Oh yeah, I didn't tell you.
[76:23.05]Wait, wait, wait.
[76:23.61]What are you talking about?
[76:24.83]What do you mean, remember when you spit on my pizza?
[76:27.93]Yeah.
[76:28.63]Did you tell, like, a story of, like, laugh out loud, I spit on Jeremy's pizza?
[76:32.23]I didn't want you to find out like this.
[76:37.96]It's actually really funny that this is the first time you're hearing of it.
[76:40.48]Yeah.
[76:42.42]I don't know what to do for a long time.
[76:46.66]Um, yeah, I can't get those.
[76:47.94]I can't get the bonus, bonus bits in there.
[76:50.68]What if you can't get the bonus bits?
[76:52.50]Ashley can get the bonus bits.
[76:58.28]Wow, imagine that's the only person here who isn't a streamer getting the bonus bits.
[77:02.40]Hey, we, we were gonna do a thing.
[77:04.38]Remember, do you remember the, like, you spit a huge disgusting loogie in my drink and I drank it?
[77:10.57]Do you remember that?
[77:11.15]Yeah, that was weird though because you wanted it.
[77:14.60]This one you didn't know about.
[77:16.34]Alright, so you guys remember the, like, the star comes in, like, breaks in my window stream, right?
[77:22.88]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[77:23.84]We were gonna do a thing where when he was sitting down and we were talking, I was gonna get up to do something and he was gonna do a disgusting, real, huge, like, Skittles loogie into the drink that was on the table.
[77:35.97]And then I was gonna come back, and without changing a frame or a cut, I was gonna drink all of it.
[77:42.17]Like, it was gonna be like four or five gulps left in my soda.
[77:46.41]And I was gonna do the whole thing.
[77:48.15]And it was gonna be in frame the whole time.
[77:49.39]And then I was gonna say...
[77:53.74]You missed that taste, don't you?
[77:55.33]And then I was not allowed to say that.
[77:56.97]Yeah, no.
[77:57.53]You were not.
[77:59.19]That's why we can't.
[78:00.37]Because I knew you could do that.
[78:02.81]So that's why I was like, no.
[78:03.81]That whole thing before was going to be we try and kill each other.
[78:06.88]Yes, we were like trying to poison each other.
[78:09.75]Everybody evolve.
[78:11.35]I was gonna go get like a cup.
[78:13.43]Like two cups.
[78:14.17]Like, hey!
[78:14.85]Here you go!
[78:15.81]Are you thirsty?
[78:18.95]We're gonna do the two cups, one of them's poison thing.
[78:22.07]And each time that one of us... No, don't do that.
[78:27.21]And we were gonna be switching the po- we were gonna both know, like, I was gonna try to poison Star, right?
[78:32.55]And he was gonna be like, I, I, you know, Chad, like, I know what's going on here.
[78:37.17]What?
[78:38.29]And he was gonna switch the cups around, and then he was gonna poison one.
[78:42.51]And switch it, you know, like, you guys ever seen Princess Bride?
[78:46.67]Yeah.
[78:46.79]It's a great movie.
[78:48.11]Um, you know that scene?
[78:50.03]Where he's like, and then I switch the poisons back because you switched the poisons, and therefore I build the poisons in front of me!
[78:56.75]That is a classic.
[78:57.77]It's a classic piece of cinnamon.
[78:59.93]We were going to do that, and both of them were going to be poisoned.
[79:03.46]And it was just the whole stream we were going to be switching back and forth poisoned cups.
[79:10.94]And we were both going to drink them.
[79:16.40]Why didn't you do any of those?
[79:17.96]Because we were just like, we probably can't, like, do this.
[79:22.08]Why not?
[79:23.24]I forget.
[79:24.16]I forget why we didn't do it.
[79:28.83]Because there's probably something in the Twitch Terms of Service where you can't pretend to poison each other on stream.
[79:35.61]I'm sure there's something exists there.
[79:39.37]Where's the harm?
[79:44.66]Star wasn't gonna pretend.
[79:48.10]You actually bring poison?
[79:50.72]Yeah, it's a funny joke!
[79:51.82]Who's gonna drink the poison?
[79:57.14]Guys, I haven't done anything for, like, two full minutes.
[79:59.02]Are we good?
[80:00.32]We're good.
[80:00.74]We're good.
[80:01.76]You know how hard it is to order poison on the internet?
[80:04.78]I would hope impossible.
[80:06.85]Well, it's not, but it's pretty hard.
[80:08.85]Okay, I can attach.
[80:13.57]There you go.
[80:16.45]I watched, like, a murder trial.
[80:17.65]This guy was, like, the most unsure murderer of all time.
[80:20.36]Coming up with all these different, varied schemes to get rid of this guy.
[80:25.52]He did a lot of research.
[80:27.10]So I found out a lot about ordering poison on the internet.
[80:32.90]Why does she know?
[80:33.72]Oh, there's big ones up there.
[80:40.81]There's big ones.
[80:42.11]We need more bounces.
[80:43.83]We need more bounces.
[80:45.01]Launch me.
[80:46.15]Alright, here we go.
[80:48.41]You gotta shoot it.
[80:50.33]I gotta shoot it.
[80:50.89]Okay.
[80:53.23]Let's show it.
[80:54.20]Don't... Those weren't even big.
[80:56.64]Come on.
[80:57.78]This was small.
[80:58.22]Well, I mean, there was a lot.
[81:01.76]Hog incoming.
[81:02.90]Get down.
[81:03.52]Hey, hey.
[81:07.84]Ow.
[81:08.36]I didn't mean that one.
[81:12.07]Usually I mean them.
[81:13.37]I mean ball.
[81:14.61]Oh, I miss ball.
[81:19.95]Can I shoot through?
[81:20.59]I can't get off of it.
[81:22.39]Whoa.
[81:29.68]What does this do for us?
[81:32.72]No, you need to pull that over.
[81:33.82]Ah, yeah.
[81:35.24]Oh, my God.
[81:36.18]The brain.
[81:37.64]You didn't say to do that.
[81:38.44]He was complimenting my brain.
[81:44.99]I was complimenting Jerma.
[81:46.07]I think he's much smarter than anyone gives him credit for.
[81:48.37]Why can't you compliment me?
[81:50.53]Who else would tell other people to spit in a drink so that they could drink it?
[81:54.24]It's just a few raindrops.
[81:56.08]We need to get up there.
[81:59.76]Yeah, because I wanted to have it be completely in frame the whole time.
[82:03.77]Like, that soda does not move.
[82:06.99]I think if you don't do it now after you describe it, that makes you a coward.
[82:09.93]Like, there's no... Guys, there's all kinds of shit up here.
[82:13.31]Yeah, are you getting it?
[82:14.05]I need you guys to get up here.
[82:16.04]There's, like, all this light and bouncing and spinning and... I need... I need Steve to stop that...
[82:32.28]Every time I think you're gonna grab something, you grab the opposite item.
[82:35.16]That would be disgusting.
[82:39.92]Jerma is on- hold on.
[82:41.69]Jerma is on weapons-grade laxatives right now.
[82:45.05]Jump up.
[82:47.31]What?
[82:47.53]Steve?
[82:53.40]What's going on?
[82:54.06]What are you guys doing?
[82:56.80]Me jump?
[82:57.92]God dammit!
[82:59.60]We're such fucking... Get off!
[83:00.94]I can't move it if you're on!
[83:01.92]Me jump!
[83:02.16]Alright, now let me... Alright, I'm holding it.
[83:12.08]Oh god, that helps.
[83:14.44]Dar?
[83:16.42]We're good.
[83:17.06]We're good.
[83:17.52]We just had a moment.
[83:18.68]Just look at all this stuff in here.
[83:19.70]There's like a key in there and shit.
[83:23.72]Whoa, what does that do?
[83:26.76]Oh, it causes the light to be black, so you have to grab this thing.
[83:29.38]Oh.
[83:30.75]And then I think... Nope.
[83:32.45]Yeah.
[83:34.23]Nope.
[83:35.67]I'll hold it the other... I'm holding it!
[83:39.81]It's pulling me!
[83:41.07]Wait, I have to attach it.
[83:42.87]Got it.
[83:45.83]No.
[83:47.45]That's not how it... Why is that not working?
[83:49.33]Why did it get longer?
[83:51.09]Here we go.
[83:52.30]Whatever.
[83:53.06]What's in there?
[83:53.60]Door.
[83:54.20]I found a part of my door.
[83:58.92]The whole quest was for home improvement.
[84:00.88]We got points.
[84:03.20]I got a skill.
[84:03.76]Did you get a skill?
[84:04.38]Rescue the prince and then redo his house.
[84:06.08]Oh yeah, we got skilled!
[84:07.29]That's what I... And that was a smart thing.
[84:11.53]I don't want to... I don't want this skill.
[84:13.51]That skill's dumb.
[84:14.71]I don't want to upgrade the other people.
[84:16.31]I want to upgrade me.
[84:19.44]Yeah, I want to upgrade me too.
[84:21.34]I don't want to just upgrade somebody.
[84:22.46]Fuck you guys.
[84:23.74]I don't want that skill.
[84:24.74]I think we can wait.
[84:26.36]I think you just like... There's like five skills in these trees.
[84:30.73]I think you just take them.
[84:33.37]No, I don't want that skill.
[84:34.51]How do I... I was doing my points.
[84:43.30]She's back.
[84:44.60]How gracious of you to help us again.
[84:49.14]It'll move it.
[84:51.28]Just give it some time.
[84:52.74]I'm so impatient.
[84:54.72]Give it a minute.
[84:56.36]There it goes.
[85:03.08]Does anybody else feel like they've been on this first level for like three hours?
[85:06.57]This is not the first level.
[85:08.13]Well, I mean like the first real level.
[85:10.63]That was last level.
[85:11.93]Oh, wait.
[85:12.73]Let him stand on it.
[85:19.09]A bird?
[85:19.59]You're being kind of stupid.
[85:20.61]No offense.
[85:22.03]I think we just have to- yeah, just jump.
[85:27.10]Well done.
[85:27.90]You didn't even pelt it with arrows?
[85:30.64]I knocked one arrow over there.
[85:33.52]Like, that's so funny.
[85:39.37]I wanted the bird to do a reaction video.
[85:43.87]That's a massive bird!
[85:46.35]A reaction video.
[85:49.89]Have you been watching reaction videos?
[85:51.29]You keep bringing them up.
[85:52.53]No.
[85:53.49]That usually indicates that you're secretly watching them and are guilty about it.
[85:56.77]I'm not this linear of a character, Ashley.
[85:59.99]You are, though.
[86:01.45]Am I hurting my back?
[86:03.99]Jeremy, you gotta go get this.
[86:05.85]Yep.
[86:07.79]I weigh, like, 300 pounds.
[86:09.23]You can't expect me to do things like this.
[86:17.31]Oh, he lived.
[86:18.51]For...
[86:19.06]Well, I jumped too early.
[86:21.28]Too late.
[86:21.68]Oh, you got the credit for living.
[86:23.90]Hey, by the way, speaking of, like, the React videos, I saw your, like, Star React stream.
[86:29.47]I know.
[86:29.91]You were there.
[86:30.35]It was pretty good.
[86:32.63]It was, like, pretty good.
[86:33.35]What would you rate it out of ten?
[86:35.17]Four.
[86:36.71]Four out of ten.
[86:38.25]Wow, that's better than usual.
[86:40.31]No, it... Four out of ten.
[86:41.79]No, it was like an eight and a half.
[86:48.66]What would have made it a 10 in your opinion, if you took your shirt off?
[87:00.92]Less music.
[87:03.87]Oh, the jazz.
[87:04.83]You're not a fan of the jazz?
[87:07.23]No music.
[87:08.15]Turn it off.
[87:12.59]I got him.
[87:13.03]We can go.
[87:20.81]Found him.
[87:21.25]We missed Bloods.
[87:22.52]I'm being rushed.
[87:23.14]Red eyes.
[87:50.92]Okay, so the next cutscene we have, we have to mute the whole game.
[87:55.88]And then each of our characters, each one of us has to do the dialogue on the bottom of the screen.
[88:00.30]Not again.
[88:02.23]Am I muted?
[88:02.73]Okay.
[88:02.91]Yeah, no, okay.
[88:03.55]I don't have any dialogue on my screen.
[88:08.87]You have to turn subtitles on.
[88:10.73]Yeah, turn subtitles on and then... Oh, hold on.
[88:15.37]It's like a giant.
[88:16.55]Why can't I fucking move?
[88:24.25]Why is this happening?
[88:25.33]It's like a wolf eating you.
[88:33.79]I clicked in the window like five times!
[88:36.74]You gotta res him.
[88:38.80]I do?
[88:40.74]God.
[88:41.40]I don't know why, but this does this.
[88:44.80]Exclusive window.
[88:46.04]Except I clicked in it.
[88:55.39]I gotta get this guy up here.
[88:56.31]Oh, I'm dead.
[88:58.45]No you're not.
[89:02.51]You're fine.
[89:03.81]Oh!
[89:03.97]I missed.
[89:12.59]A giant nightmare wolf.
[89:14.86]Good name.
[89:17.34]That really is literally its name.
[89:20.02]Giant nightmare wolf.
[89:21.46]That's alright.
[89:23.24]Not the one, A1.
[89:32.85]Harder than stiff, yeah.
[89:34.69]Almost dead.
[89:38.63]Nice.
[89:48.44]The prince ran off!
[89:51.08]Then we must follow him!
[89:52.48]He doesn't come.
[89:54.39]I say we knock him unconscious and carry him back to the astral academy.
[89:58.93]Um, Ashley, how come you didn't run up to the prince and drive your sword through his chest?
[90:03.36]I did, but the cutscene locked me in place.
[90:11.24]Hello?
[90:11.72]What?
[90:11.88]In my mind, I did.
[90:14.68]Alright, everybody, for a second, just quickly, can we hit start, all of you?
[90:20.99]Go to options.
[90:22.23]Just hit start, go to options.
[90:24.29]Go to dialogue.
[90:26.05]Bring dialogue to zero.
[90:28.21]And then, uh, confirm?
[90:31.15]Because the next cutscene, we're going to do our characters' voices.
[90:35.85]Okay.
[90:37.03]Okay.
[90:37.25]I can't wait for this to happen, though.
[90:47.05]I'm Meatwad, by the way.
[90:57.02]You just do Meatwad.
[90:59.04]I mean, I'm a bad impression of Meatwad, that's what it is.
[91:01.93]Why is it just snapping?
[91:03.09]Look at this.
[91:03.59]Come on.
[91:10.35]Wait, hold on.
[91:10.71]Everyone was just on board with this 15 seconds ago, and all of a sudden I hit- I go on the options and actually turn it off, and now we're not on board with it anymore?
[91:17.22]We're on board.
[91:18.06]What are you talking about?
[91:19.44]No, I'm talking about the fucking crowd.
[91:22.79]Oh, the crowd doesn't want this?
[91:24.99]Cringe.
[91:26.85]Cringe, dude.
[91:27.95]You're gonna pretend to be a cringe, dude.
[91:32.67]That's so cringe.
[91:34.53]What the fuck?
[91:38.47]What this is.
[91:41.79]Uh, do I attach to this and then attach to that?
[91:46.48]Uh, go up there and push the top one in?
[91:50.04]To the top right?
[91:51.48]Can I just... I don't think I can do that.
[91:53.12]Jump on top of this box.
[91:56.29]Nope.
[91:57.55]Shit.
[91:59.21]I mean, I can... Oh!
[92:00.11]But you can just grab it!
[92:04.63]Alright, I'm gonna take one of them.
[92:06.57]Can you shoot the top one?
[92:21.09]Well, now I'm never noticing when the characters talk.
[92:24.43]Because we turned it off.
[92:25.73]Yeah.
[92:28.21]Well, no, it has talked.
[92:29.61]The subtitles are on.
[92:30.61]Yeah, no, our characters have said things.
[92:33.41]Nope.
[92:41.24]Can you move it closer?
[92:42.92]No, Star's really watching his performance.
[92:44.64]Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no!
[92:49.61]I have to put it on the wall, otherwise we're gonna jump forward and die and I can't move it because Jerm is on it.
[92:54.05]Well, go for it.
[92:54.61]And now it's roped so I can't move it further.
[92:58.25]But now you gotta rope it.
[93:00.33]There you go.
[93:09.92]Uh-oh.
[93:11.00]Bugs.
[93:12.42]A nightmare spider.
[93:22.13]Then me?
[93:22.55]Then Ashley.
[93:24.47]You're the wizard.
[93:25.13]The wizard can get nerfed like ten times.
[93:28.57]Cringe spider.
[93:30.52]See, your character's talking!
[93:32.68]The wizard's... No, no, no, this doesn't count.
[93:36.12]It doesn't count?
[93:36.90]Okay, it doesn't count.
[93:38.06]It has to be in a cutscene.
[93:39.66]Alright, we'll turn it back on.
[93:42.36]You gave up?
[93:43.84]Well, just... Wait, once we get to the end of the level, turn it off.
[93:47.48]Or how are we going to know?
[93:48.56]Always these gigantic $20,000 schemes.
[93:51.62]Fire arrows.
[93:52.48]What the fuck?
[93:58.00]Holy shit.
[93:58.76]I'm way cooler than everybody in this game, though.
[94:02.32]How did you get fire arrows?
[94:04.26]They just gave it to me.
[94:05.30]No, I just gave it to him.
[94:06.46]They just gave it to him.
[94:07.70]Ice arrows to freeze the rotating platform.
[94:09.55]Oh my god.
[94:09.87]They're just giving it to him.
[94:12.07]This is so cool.
[94:13.69]Freeze the platform.
[94:15.29]So I think you have to get off it.
[94:18.85]Because I have to freeze it, right?
[94:20.21]So it needs to... Yeah, get off.
[94:23.75]Get off.
[94:24.81]Now I go like this.
[94:25.81]And it's frozen.
[94:26.69]And now we can get up there.
[94:29.33]I don't know why it wasn't... I can't get my box through.
[94:34.79]Hold on.
[94:39.25]Oh, shit.
[94:41.89]Oh, shit.
[94:43.27]Well, it's frozen, so we can do that now.
[94:45.25]Just need a box or something?
[94:46.49]Or a...
[94:49.64]I don't like that Jerma's character is, like, going to be doing things.
[94:54.27]Oh, no.
[94:54.87]What a disaster.
[95:04.34]He has to freeze them.
[95:06.60]Come on.
[95:07.62]Oh, one at a time.
[95:09.40]One at a time.
[95:11.16]Yeah.
[95:14.22]Just stay on the first one.
[95:17.44]And then... Yeah.
[95:19.58]Like, I mean, I can... Like, yeah, just... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[95:23.71]Well, let me just get on here.
[95:24.55]Yeah, you can just make the jump.
[95:26.83]You don't have to do that.
[95:28.47]You can just make it.
[95:30.72]Just stand on that one for a second and... No, just stand...
[95:33.78]Just let him do it his own way.
[95:37.82]Hold on.
[95:38.56]I'm sorry.
[95:39.78]You don't have to control your friends.
[95:41.23]I'm sorry.
[95:42.79]If I want to do something a different way, I get like... Jirba!
[95:46.29]Jirba!
[95:46.79]Jirba!
[95:47.37]Jirba, what are you doing?
[95:48.39]Jirba!
[95:50.11]Jirba, get over here!
[95:51.03]That won't be someone.
[95:53.25]We sound like thugs.
[95:54.55]That's what he thinks we sound like.
[95:56.50]Jirba!
[95:58.86]Jirba!
[95:59.14]Hey!
[95:59.40]Whoa!
[95:59.70]Hey!
[95:59.90]What are you doing?
[96:00.90]That's right!
[96:01.82]Come on now!
[96:02.58]Whoa!
[96:02.78]Hey!
[96:04.74]You guys are fucking Beetlejuice!
[96:11.28]Oh.
[96:15.64]Character's Johnny Barak.
[96:16.70]He said it once.
[96:17.44]No!
[96:24.57]Oh, I'm still alive!
[96:27.07]I can't get it.
[96:31.19]Fuck!
[96:31.63]Yeah, get it.
[96:32.01]There you go.
[96:33.99]Oh.
[96:35.79]Uh, we don't go this way.
[96:38.66]We have to go this way.
[96:43.82]Nice fucking model!
[96:46.07]Get in here, Ashley.
[96:46.73]Why did I read that?
[96:48.29]What?
[96:48.99]Get in here.
[96:49.51]I can't.
[96:51.21]Yeah, you can.
[96:51.97]What are you talking about?
[96:53.57]I didn't realize what part of the movie that is.
[96:57.54]Oh, shit.
[97:00.42]Oh, shit.
[97:01.58]Jerma, you're not doing the joke at all.
[97:04.54]Uh, no, you don't.
[97:05.66]Something else happened.
[97:07.47]Something else, a little more, uh... I saw Honk in the chat.
[97:12.83]And I... Oh, never mind.
[97:13.83]I was gonna move on from that one.
[97:18.33]Wait.
[97:20.59]There's things up there.
[97:22.71]Every time you go like, uh-oh, Jerma, I think you have, like, a bathroom problem.
[97:27.31]Same.
[97:28.37]We worry.
[97:29.71]We worry about you.
[97:31.59]You do realize that I'm on an actual prescription grade laxative right now.
[97:34.77]You know that, right?
[97:35.41]That's not a joke.
[97:36.92]No, it's not a joke.
[97:39.28]Every time you show concern.
[97:41.32]Where are my thoughts going?
[97:42.68]He's on a weapons grade laxative.
[97:47.52]Ooh, I froze it.
[97:49.44]Skill point coming up.
[97:50.24]Can I freeze your box?
[97:52.11]I don't think so.
[97:55.17]How are we supposed to do that?
[97:59.37]Uh, get off my box?
[98:00.85]You can rope my boxes so I can stick my box up here.
[98:03.99]Oh, shit.
[98:05.45]Oh, I didn't know that was going to come down.
[98:08.77]You can stick it there.
[98:09.65]Okay, now I can hold it up.
[98:15.95]It might still drop when you wait.
[98:17.67]You waste so much.
[98:18.69]Okay, so then, now what?
[98:22.89]Now nothing.
[98:23.39]This isn't it.
[98:24.13]You gotta get off.
[98:31.29]No, it's not dark web laxative.
[98:33.58]No.
[98:34.78]Can that stay there?
[98:35.90]Now, what if... Is there anything I can... What about freezing it?
[98:39.28]Can I freeze it?
[98:40.84]No.
[98:41.44]No, no, no, no, no.
[98:42.20]I'm talking about this thing.
[98:43.00]Oh, the platform?
[98:43.42]Yeah, the platform.
[98:45.02]There you go.
[98:45.90]Now get off of it, Ashley.
[98:47.00]You're ruining it, Ashley.
[98:49.84]Now you got me.
[98:50.42]Now you gotta grapple up.
[98:53.40]Look at you.
[98:54.00]Look at you.
[98:55.20]Aw, a blue quill.
[98:56.03]That's what I'm talking about.
[99:00.11]Upgrade point.
[99:04.77]Dude, I have two available upgrade points.
[99:06.87]I can upgrade so many things.
[99:10.11]20 more drops of Jerma blood before I can get something else.
[99:16.06]So I think you actually have to put points into other characters.
[99:20.84]Have to?
[99:21.88]You don't have to.
[99:24.10]I don't think you have to.
[99:25.74]Don't let them talk.
[99:26.84]Don't even let them talk.
[99:27.88]The ones that are in squares, you get them as you play.
[99:30.85]The Nightmare Prince is in the background!
[99:32.27]Steve!
[99:33.67]What?
[99:34.45]I need your help.
[99:35.11]No one's listening to me.
[99:36.93]We don't wanna hear you.
[99:37.93]Jerma, tell us about your day.
[99:39.85]My day was pretty sick.
[99:44.21]Um... I need to- hold on.
[99:47.32]Spylo Ello.
[99:55.22]Spylo Ello.
[99:56.10]Spylo Ello.
[99:56.60]Freeze that one real quick.
[100:03.18]Can you guys all get up here?
[100:05.44]I will, I will.
[100:06.15]Whoa, did you just get like an illusory wall?
[100:09.41]No, I mean, you couldn't... I mean, yeah, sure.
[100:12.37]Whoa.
[100:12.57]Let me just freeze that one real quick.
[100:14.33]Oh my god, he froze it.
[100:17.53]Oh my god.
[100:18.15]Oh, shit.
[100:22.82]What is he doing over there?
[100:24.90]Can you break through this gate?
[100:27.60]How do we open it?
[100:28.14]Yeah, there you go.
[100:29.94]And you get the spoils in the middle.
[100:34.25]I'm so spoiled now.
[100:36.85]And you never told us about your day.
[100:38.13]I thought you wanted us to listen.
[100:40.27]Um... Wait, hold on.
[100:42.55]Use ice arrows to make ice raft.
[100:45.73]What?
[100:46.13]Ice car.
[100:48.90]Okay, so that's cool.
[100:50.26]How come your character gets to do everything now?
[100:52.54]Because you chose wrong.
[100:56.24]So stick it on there so we can do it right, or I'll just jump on it.
[101:00.12]Yeah, you don't even need me anymore, because you get ice arrows and fire arrows and...
[101:04.88]Yeah, just wait until we get to the wizard level where I can... Oh, um... Do the voices.
[101:09.50]No, it's too late.
[101:10.16]Do the voices.
[101:10.58]That's his voice.
[101:11.10]He doesn't have a voice.
[101:11.76]The wizards gave you a magic talisman.
[101:12.90]What does it do?
[101:21.98]He doesn't have one.
[101:24.29]You were just the demon inside of that guy's head while he was talking.
[101:27.35]You were feeding him lines.
[101:28.59]Okay, that was great.
[101:29.67]That was great that we all collectively did that during the next cutscene.
[101:33.17]That was awesome.
[101:33.99]Turn my dialogue back on.
[101:42.36]I'm so glad I got to be a little wish and could talk.
[101:44.20]Like I said, I got a big one and nobody cared.
[101:51.41]Wow, he got a big one.
[101:56.81]Ooh, I can actually freeze them.
[102:02.31]Holy shit, they made this character awesome.
[102:04.39]I can do everything.
[102:08.63]I call that perfect timing.
[102:17.70]What would you call it?
[102:20.30]Uh, if that was one of those, like, arcade machines where you gotta wait for the lights to come around the circle, and then when the light is on the right light, then you just go stop, and then you get the prize if you stop it on the light, you would've got the prize when you touched the light.
[102:30.94]Yeah.
[102:31.38]Probably.
[102:36.78]I love the warrior's voice.
[102:41.56]It sounds so stupid.
[102:44.00]You can't do better.
[102:46.16]Why would you freeze that?
[102:47.01]Why would you freeze that?
[102:48.09]Unfreeze it now.
[102:49.77]Why would you... Jerma.
[102:51.33]Fucking Jerma.
[102:52.39]Jerma's throwing.
[102:53.69]I would like a please.
[102:54.81]Jerma's throwing?
[102:59.53]I shot an arrow at a thing.
[103:01.71]Aw, man.
[103:02.61]You may as well have walked into the tower six times.
[103:04.49]Get off my box!
[103:20.96]Who even knows what that puzzle was?
[103:22.43]Who even knows?
[103:23.51]We got dogs.
[103:26.77]Uh oh.
[103:29.81]Geisel.
[103:53.89]So where does this need to be frozen?
[103:57.14]Or is it just a... Hold on.
[103:58.72]I think it's a butt pounder.
[104:00.60]Is it a butt pounder?
[104:01.42]Oh, we gotta touch a thing out here.
[104:06.00]Oh, okay.
[104:06.70]Throw me up.
[104:07.10]Okay, active.
[104:12.97]And then that's a butt pounder.
[104:18.09]But then how do you get up?
[104:25.98]I think that is how you get up.
[104:27.38]Yeah.
[104:27.82]Okay.
[104:28.04]Is that working?
[104:29.80]It should.
[104:30.28]Kind of.
[104:32.22]Whoa.
[104:33.14]Try to... Can you do it further away?
[104:35.30]Yeah.
[104:36.21]There.
[104:37.93]Yeah.
[104:38.47]There we go.
[104:40.61]Dude, look at us.
[104:41.23]The three triners.
[104:44.63]Oh, hey.
[104:45.01]I got this.
[104:48.33]Wow.
[104:48.53]You're so useful, Steve.
[104:50.01]Wow.
[104:50.37]My character.
[104:51.05]Fuck you with your ice.
[104:52.51]It's supposed to be my job.
[104:54.76]Not anymore.
[104:55.85]You're not even an ice wizard.
[104:57.23]Hold on, there's something over there on the left.
[104:59.25]Over that way.
[105:05.48]Yep.
[105:06.48]Secret.
[105:08.38]Wow, and only you can unlock it, Jerma.
[105:13.41]Stop throwing that in here.
[105:14.65]I need to... I think that actually helps somehow.
[105:17.31]I think so too.
[105:19.21]Get me out!
[105:21.59]Go up around.
[105:22.51]And then... Now I'll pull you in.
[105:27.98]Nope.
[105:29.20]What?
[105:30.10]You gotta walk all the way to the right.
[105:31.48]Okay, there you go.
[105:35.01]Not even an ice wizard.
[105:40.65]That's very humiliating for him.
[105:41.93]My favorite wizard is ball lightning.
[105:45.19]I'm a wizard.
[105:47.29]I'm ice and fire wizard.
[105:49.29]You're just guy that can pick stuff up from ground.
[105:52.29]I make box.
[106:00.37]Yeah, make fun of my box now.
[106:02.47]Well, I just, I did.
[106:03.47]Because now we need your box to hold that down.
[106:07.58]You see what's happening here?
[106:09.58]You need your box in there, so then she can get in.
[106:14.36]Wow.
[106:15.06]Box guy.
[106:15.88]Hey, take it from an ice wizard.
[106:17.14]Oh, wow.
[106:19.88]Thanks, Jerome.
[106:20.46]That was cool.
[106:21.62]Remember that time you gave me your sandwich?
[106:27.25]Yeah.
[106:27.81]Prinsilius, why are your wolves and spiders attacking us?
[106:30.95]Do you really want us dead?
[106:32.17]Satan.
[106:32.31]Reading for the character.
[106:35.17]Satan's audition tape.
[106:36.27]We're trying for... I am Asmodeus.
[107:00.41]Uh, sorry, Satan.
[107:01.15]We're thinking we're going in a more lighthearted direction with this one.
[107:04.11]Okay, I'm a better wizard than you, but you kill things faster than both of us.
[107:10.86]Because you just drop blocks on head.
[107:14.24]It is true.
[107:14.80]You do a shit ton of damage for no reason.
[107:17.07]I've one-shot every enemy so far.
[107:18.63]Here.
[107:20.75]Okay.
[107:23.46]Put box on head or pre-recorded.
[107:25.13]Well, you have to do that now.
[107:25.97]I mean, that just proves it, at least.
[107:28.85]Well, if you guys were here earlier, you know that box on head is the endgame.
[107:34.65]Oh, that's right.
[107:35.17]There might be a thing up here.
[107:36.67]Is there?
[107:37.94]Maybe.
[107:42.20]Um... I think you're gonna have to, like... I'm gonna have to do the worms.
[107:45.70]I'm gonna have to do the worms ninja rope.
[107:48.52]Yeah, that's kind of...
[107:50.97]There is something up here.
[107:52.51]And it is an elaborate thing that we need, I think, more than one person for.
[107:57.48]Aw, okay.
[107:58.10]Hold on, wait.
[108:00.10]Can I drop it somehow?
[108:03.90]Is there a thing I can shoot, maybe?
[108:05.24]Ashley, Ashley, die already.
[108:07.32]I don't want to die, it hurts!
[108:11.85]Oh, we're gonna need your help to get over.
[108:13.65]I think you gotta make, like, a rope for us.
[108:16.71]Do I?
[108:19.62]Yeah.
[108:20.38]Um, okay.
[108:22.29]Well, I... Please, as the OP character, come make a bridge for us to cross like I would normally be doing.
[108:33.85]Yeah, okay.
[108:36.45]So that.
[108:36.79]Alright, now we all have to go over there.
[108:45.81]Because then there's this stuff.
[108:48.28]Sorry, I will unfreeze it.
[108:49.34]Get out the way.
[108:49.92]I love how you're already frozen.
[108:51.76]Get off my box.
[108:52.40]Get out the way.
[108:52.90]I got this.
[108:53.34]I'm gonna solo it.
[108:54.86]Alright, let him solo it.
[108:55.64]Alright.
[108:57.12]Let him do his thing that he wants to do so bad.
[109:01.20]Alright, cool.
[109:02.26]Nice.
[109:03.78]Alright, cool.
[109:06.41]Is that what I sound like?
[109:09.17]Yeah.
[109:10.25]Alright, cool.
[109:12.45]Alright.
[109:13.31]I don't remember sounding... Alright.
[109:17.68]Missed the collectible?
[109:19.38]Did you miss the collectible?
[109:20.38]Did you really get up there?
[109:21.82]You cared so much about your ego and how good you are at video games that you didn't get the collectible.
[109:25.64]I just want to feel like my character can do something.
[109:28.78]You know?
[109:30.23]I feel like when they designed Trine, they knew I was going to be the wizard and they wanted me to feel bad.
[109:35.13]Jerm is more of a Patrick than a Squidward.
[109:46.69]I would say star is a squid word.
[109:48.01]Yeah.
[109:48.23]I'll agree with that.
[109:49.49]I want to be Mr. Fred's.
[109:50.54]Ashley is the one doing nothing.
[109:52.32]Ban that guy instantly.
[109:53.16]Come on.
[109:53.62]Where are my mods?
[110:14.63]He dropped, like, a rope or some... What, do you need help?
[110:19.23]All of a sudden, you need help?
[110:20.61]No, I don't.
[110:21.55]I don't need any help.
[110:22.45]Okay.
[110:25.75]Jerm is the one who needs help.
[110:27.94]I was up top the whole time.
[110:29.16]No, I don't.
[110:29.88]No, I don't.
[110:30.30]He doesn't need help?
[110:31.48]I don't.
[110:31.96]No.
[110:32.12]Okay.
[110:36.62]I don't.
[110:37.24]Just stay there.
[110:43.64]Did Spongebob do this?
[110:47.31]Alright, let's go.
[110:47.87]Now that we've all done it.
[110:49.85]Spongebob kind of does do that, but except instead of pounding, it goes... Hey, guys, remember this?
[110:58.52]Here, you stand on my box.
[111:00.64]Oh, no.
[111:00.86]Does that even work?
[111:08.55]And then...
[111:10.89]Hold, hold, okay.
[111:12.47]Okay, you jump and... Everyone hated that.
[111:15.41]Jerma has to shoot... Stop!
[111:18.95]Ashley, go to the left.
[111:21.31]Alright, I mean, that one worked.
[111:23.63]I have to freeze it.
[111:24.51]I know!
[111:25.11]Alright.
[111:27.34]And then I shoot another one.
[111:28.32]Jerma can just freeze all of them.
[111:30.52]Just now, hold it up there.
[111:31.50]Watch this.
[111:33.38]Okay, never mind.
[111:34.36]Jerma does the whole puzzle.
[111:36.98]Yeah, nice character, Trine 4.
[111:43.02]Oh no, there's a combat sequence.
[111:44.59]I wonder if Star will kill everything in less than 10 seconds.
[111:49.17]Hmm.
[111:49.99]Should I even fight?
[111:53.59]You know, that goes both ways, right?
[111:56.45]You can freeze them.
[111:57.27]I don't want to hear shit from you.
[112:00.23]We missed a secret.
[112:05.29]Over this way.
[112:07.33]Or something.
[112:07.91]Where is it?
[112:09.71]Are you listening to your chat right now?
[112:11.09]No, no, no.
[112:12.07]Look, look.
[112:12.63]It's right here.
[112:13.25]Is it up?
[112:14.05]It's up.
[112:14.69]There it is.
[112:15.65]Yeah, there it is.
[112:23.36]You coming, big boy?
[112:24.82]Thank you to Squirds for the five community subs.
[112:28.74]Thank you, Squirds.
[112:29.78]Appreciate it.
[112:33.48]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[112:34.96]Here.
[112:35.78]Congratulations to those who got it.
[112:41.29]So what's up there?
[112:41.73]So much blood in here.
[112:43.23]But we need you guys.
[112:45.77]Well, at least I need Jerma.
[112:47.45]You need me?
[112:47.81]I don't know about Steve.
[112:49.33]Yeah.
[112:49.61]Okay.
[112:51.77]Thanks for the boost.
[112:53.44]Hey!
[112:57.54]Okay, what's up here?
[112:58.40]Ooh, one of these things.
[113:00.80]I think I can give you a bridge.
[113:03.56]That'd be cool, wouldn't it?
[113:06.39]Can I do that?
[113:07.23]Yeah, I can.
[113:10.29]And there's a treasure in here.
[113:12.83]Oh, look at that chat.
[113:13.71]I got it as a key.
[113:15.45]That's cool how you guys needed me.
[113:17.03]Well, you are turning into like the third wheel here instead.
[113:19.09]Um, can I get some more water?
[113:21.51]Yeah.
[113:22.99]Can I pee?
[113:25.17]Also, can I see a drink menu when you get a chance?
[113:28.49]Uh, yeah.
[113:35.10]Today our special is... lemonade.
[113:41.43]What a shitty restaurant.
[113:45.08]Oh, okay.
[113:45.90]You have lemonade today.
[113:48.94]Ow.
[113:51.34]It's poisoned.
[113:52.12]Oh, I got you, Ashley.
[114:06.02]Today's special, bread.
[114:07.64]Our special, bread and lump bait.
[114:15.89]What is that?
[114:17.31]Our dessert menu, we have a bag of Oreos.
[114:20.41]Is this prison?
[114:21.23]Is this the prison restaurant?
[114:25.49]Wouldn't it be cool if the two of you went to prison together?
[114:31.52]It would.
[114:31.86]We should film that video.
[114:32.94]No, they've made movies about that kind of shit before.
[114:35.65]But not with us.
[114:37.73]Yeah, but it would be the same movie.
[114:41.59]But better.
[114:43.19]Oh, two guys.
[114:44.03]Two guys are not prepared for prison.
[114:46.04]Go to prison.
[114:47.06]Whoa, I wasn't ready for this.
[114:50.04]Nobody's gonna read that.
[114:51.78]I'm reading it.
[114:52.58]Ooh, pink.
[114:53.96]I think this is a boss coming up.
[114:57.21]Uh-oh, mechanic?
[115:20.24]Oh, I can charge.
[115:22.72]Oh, cool.
[115:24.33]I'll just wait.
[115:27.33]You gotta charge the roll down.
[115:29.57]Instantly after a roll.
[115:31.15]Really?
[115:31.35]What does that mean?
[115:32.97]Oh, you have to charge at this thing.
[115:34.87]Okay, that was fucking cool.
[115:36.44]Come over here.
[115:37.30]Whoa.
[115:38.54]I get a super arrow now.
[115:40.34]You guys, this looks so... Oh my god, you guys are doing such cool things.
[115:46.54]Wait.
[115:47.96]Do you need a box?
[115:49.12]I need someone to go in there.
[115:50.62]No, we don't.
[115:55.54]No, there's nothing up here.
[115:58.80]Do we need a box right now?
[116:00.91]Yeah, um, excuse me.
[116:02.45]My salmon was fucking cold.
[116:06.93]Salmon?
[116:07.35]We don't serve salmon.
[116:08.95]We serve bread.
[116:09.39]You have to freeze the water there.
[116:10.89]Oh, well, I brought a freeze gun.
[116:12.41]Did I bring this?
[116:14.39]Is that why it's cold?
[116:15.11]Was this in the car?
[116:21.42]I just love it when you start role-playing out of nowhere.
[116:23.58]Imagine going to a fucking restaurant and, like, bringing, like, a whole plate of dinner, like, salmon.
[116:32.99]Like, a whole... You bring this in, and it's, like, freezing cold.
[116:36.09]And you set it up there, and you're like, excuse me.
[116:37.85]Ashley, come back here.
[116:38.63]I don't want to bother you or anything, but, like, this is freezing fucking cold.
[116:42.73]Touch it.
[116:50.49]Uh, sir, we don't have salmon on the menu.
[116:54.97]Okay, I like this joke.
[116:56.93]What do you do?
[116:57.39]Do you... Do you... No, that's when you say, yeah, it's... Oh, it's... Oh, yeah, because it was in my car.
[117:03.90]I'm sorry.
[117:04.42]Can I get the check?
[117:07.16]You haven't ordered anything.
[117:10.19]That's alright.
[117:10.65]Can I still get one?
[117:12.23]I kind of need to prove that I was here.
[117:17.30]Just in case I need an alibi.
[117:19.10]Aw, dude, it's like a... Oh, cool.
[117:20.30]Yeah, she has a blink.
[117:21.70]Hey, do you need a box?
[117:22.72]Oh, no.
[117:23.28]No.
[117:25.29]I'm out.
[117:25.61]Alright.
[117:28.87]Wait, is there anything under here?
[117:29.73]Okay, I might need a box here.
[117:33.59]Ooh, one-headed twirl!
[117:36.91]How come I can't grab that?
[117:37.73]Ooh, dude!
[117:39.36]Oh, wait!
[117:40.16]Did we go up there already?
[117:42.12]Throw me up?
[117:44.77]Sorry, sir.
[117:45.31]We don't validate alibis here.
[117:53.15]Well, there's a big... There's a big, like, 12% tip for you.
[117:56.39]Make a box, like, right here.
[117:59.03]No, no, no.
[118:00.03]No, right here.
[118:00.81]Where I'm standing.
[118:04.28]No.
[118:04.48]Please.
[118:07.20]Respect that unboxed guy or I won't do it.
[118:09.26]I need to freeze that.
[118:10.14]I respect it.
[118:11.22]But can you please put it where I can freeze it?
[118:13.20]In a good spot?
[118:14.32]Thank you.
[118:15.36]Put it in a spot where I can freeze this.
[118:17.18]She can fucking air dash.
[118:19.00]Yes, but let me, like, flex on you too.
[118:23.44]I can't put it anywhere else.
[118:24.52]I'm useless now.
[118:25.60]What is you freezing this going to do?
[118:27.96]I still made it.
[118:28.78]I still made it.
[118:29.82]Help!
[118:31.72]What are you going to do for you, though?
[118:33.86]Help!
[118:36.05]Here.
[118:38.03]Oh.
[118:39.19]Thanks, journal.
[118:39.81]You did it again.
[118:42.69]I just pulled it.
[118:43.21]Did you not get it?
[118:44.41]Oh, there we go.
[118:47.67]Oh, there's things up here.
[118:48.53]You guys, you're going so fast because your characters are so powerful you missed it.
[118:53.61]Wait, is this a case of they nerfed the wizard so much because they were afraid of how powerful he was to now the wizard's not really that great anymore?
[119:00.69]I think the next level I get my ability.
[119:03.25]I'm being dramatic until then.
[119:05.54]Are you?
[119:05.78]Is there anything else up there?
[119:08.56]Yeah, there's a big one up there.
[119:10.46]Oh, there's a big one.
[119:12.44]Big fatty.
[119:13.40]Yeah.
[119:14.04]No!
[119:14.94]Give me a boost.
[119:20.18]Woop!
[119:20.68]I didn't need it.
[119:21.80]For the record.
[119:22.38]Did you get it?
[119:22.92]Okay.
[119:23.48]Yeah, nice.
[119:28.07]I'll just- just wait until there's some combat.
[119:32.47]Uh, hold on, I need to freeze that.
[119:36.21]Oh, wait, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[119:36.93]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[119:39.95]Oh, you're blocking it.
[119:40.55]There's a box in the way.
[119:42.71]Uh-oh.
[119:43.85]We need to think about this one.
[119:44.99]Uh... I think... We need your point.
[119:51.07]No.
[119:51.41]Somebody can just stand on it.
[119:52.11]I can stick my box under it.
[119:53.27]Oh, somebody can just stand on it.
[119:55.64]Yeah, and then put it under.
[119:56.28]There we go.
[119:58.78]See?
[119:59.10]Box guy, box guy, here comes box guy.
[120:01.18]Box guy, hero.
[120:11.92]Can I freeze that?
[120:15.70]This is like the Mario level with all the invisible blocks that show up in the first spot.
[120:19.78]I'm the Kaizo block.
[120:22.44]Oh, I can freeze that.
[120:23.12]Okay.
[120:24.72]Lift me up.
[120:27.08]Hold on.
[120:27.74]Push it up like high.
[120:28.52]And then... Yeah, now I'll freeze it.
[120:32.78]Can you lift this or do I... Is that enough?
[120:35.75]I can if someone wasn't standing on it.
[120:37.23]Oh, God.
[120:39.52]But someone keeps standing on it, so I can't.
[120:41.33]I can get over there at the back of the line.
[120:43.25]Give it a good lift.
[120:43.81]Lift.
[120:44.69]There you go.
[120:47.19]See?
[120:49.59]No doubt.
[120:51.51]I mean, we were trying to freeze it, and then we can get up and do the whole teamwork thing.
[120:56.22]Nah.
[120:56.50]You might feel like you don't need the wizard anymore, but I need you.
[120:59.88]Nah.
[120:59.96]The wizard.
[121:03.82]The wizard.
[121:06.31]Oh, oh, oh.
[121:08.77]Okay, there's a bunch of stuff up here.
[121:11.09]There's a whole other way to go.
[121:12.57]What the hell is this?
[121:14.41]But wait.
[121:16.90]Get him!
[121:17.24]What's going on?
[121:22.48]Not entirely sure what's going on over there.
[121:24.32]Maybe you... I think we need to break this.
[121:25.36]You good?
[121:27.58]Yeah.
[121:31.81]So what do we do about this?
[121:33.03]You gotta get the rock from the top right, and then Ashley has to smash it at the wall.
[121:37.85]Ah.
[121:39.65]Watch out, I'm gonna smash.
[121:42.90]Smash.
[121:43.58]You gotta smash it upwards.
[121:44.94]Get out.
[121:48.16]You don't need my abilities, but you need me to tell you that you're wrong.
[121:50.99]Tell a joke or riot.
[121:52.05]Oh well, whatever.
[122:02.50]You need a box?
[122:03.52]You need a box.
[122:09.99]No squad stream?
[122:10.77]Yeah, that's because Jerma doesn't want it.
[122:13.07]He's sick of... He's sick of sharing viewers.
[122:15.93]He said it's not fair.
[122:18.53]He's not fair.
[122:19.55]You're just gonna leech off me every time.
[122:21.63]So he said he didn't want to do it anymore.
[122:23.67]This is absolutely untrue.
[122:27.05]This is total fabrication.
[122:29.17]I'm gonna defend myself here.
[122:33.17]Dermot won't even talk to anyone unless you have a stream.
[122:35.85]I can't smash that guy.
[122:37.21]He's got box blockers.
[122:40.25]Kill him.
[122:40.63]I froze him.
[122:43.27]Star, drop your box on his head.
[122:44.65]I can't.
[122:45.03]Those walls block the box.
[122:54.03]By the way, a squad stream on this game.
[122:58.91]would be you opening three tabs of the same string.
[123:02.03]Let's be clear on that.
[123:03.65]Yeah, I have to bring this rock up top.
[123:08.15]Can you freeze it?
[123:12.24]Oh, sorry.
[123:13.82]I froze it.
[123:15.96]Yeah.
[123:17.64]Do you hear that in this song?
[123:22.68]Is it doing that?
[123:24.66]It's the ding, fries are done.
[123:30.56]Can I freeze the water coming out of there?
[123:32.40]I actually don't know what that song normally is.
[123:34.39]Alright, I've got that frozen.
[123:36.31]I now bounce the water from here into the wheel.
[123:40.33]I did that already.
[123:43.71]What about the up wheel?
[123:45.01]The wheel up there.
[123:45.57]Oh, I didn't see that.
[123:48.27]What about the up wheel?
[123:52.01]How do we get the wheel?
[123:52.80]How do we get the up wheel?
[124:01.39]what's up wheel okay then freeze that and now oh okay hold on sorry if someone's gonna talk shit about me now Ster confirmed Family Guy reference that was like an e-bombs world joke meme how do we do this oh you know okay it kind of did for a second oh my god that worked

[124:38.56]Peter Pickle.
[124:39.10]What's the first one?
[124:39.68]Oh, fucking Family Guy over here.
[124:41.78]Fucking Peter.
[124:42.32]Nice.
[124:42.60]Oh, Peter.
[124:54.80]I got him saying, now you guys can take that.
[124:58.14]You guys can clip that one second that he did it.
[125:03.10]Well, there you go.
[125:05.14]Now he said it for real.
[125:08.26]Who's your favorite Family Guy character, Steve?
[125:11.28]Who do you identify with?
[125:13.24]If you're going to clip me and put me in the Jerma green screen videos, just have me show up real fast and say, anybody need a box?
[125:21.02]I need a chip jump.
[125:24.12]Nope.
[125:24.94]Fuck.
[125:25.14]I need to shift up and then I need to stop.

[126:25.68]He was a Batman.
[126:28.50]He was.
[126:30.10]Some would argue he was the best Batman.
[126:33.23]Alright, I can freeze that.
[126:34.85]But that doesn't help.
[126:35.85]I should freeze this one.
[126:40.39]Check this out.
[126:41.65]Freeze that one.
[126:44.05]And then...
[126:46.03]Never mind.
[126:47.11]Freeze this one.
[126:47.53]And then freeze the wheel?
[126:49.03]Because I can only freeze one thing at a time.
[126:50.19]And now unfreeze the other one.
[126:51.25]Because we're in.
[126:52.07]You're in.
[126:52.87]Unfreeze the wheel.
[126:56.05]You're in.
[126:56.83]Then freeze the wheel.
[126:59.03]And then get up there.
[127:01.47]And then do it again.
[127:02.17]And then do it again.
[127:03.51]And then do it again.
[127:04.80]And then do it again.
[127:06.54]And then do it again.
[127:09.42]And then do it again.

[127:21.71]Shit.
[127:22.33]No, wait.
[127:23.23]Do the bottom one.
[127:23.97]Bottom one's easier.
[127:24.67]Alright, I'm gonna shift out of here.
[127:27.53]Do it.
[127:29.60]Do it.
[127:30.48]Yeah.
[127:34.94]I missed the chest?
[127:35.86]I got the chest.
[127:36.78]You did?
[127:37.14]Yeah, the whole thing showed up.
[127:39.86]Chat, I'm banning like seven people right now.
[127:42.10]Hold on, they're all fucking gone for good.
[127:46.52]And while you're not in my chat anymore, do me a favor and look for those emails.
[127:49.86]How many permanent bans have you given out on your channel, do you think?
[127:54.38]Ow.
[127:55.82]Uh oh.
[127:57.16]I don't know.
[127:57.56]They're all gone now.
[127:58.28]I removed them all.
[128:00.00]Alright, so we got... What do we got here?
[128:03.42]We have water.
[128:06.15]Which, okay.
[128:07.59]I tried to grab the thing, but it didn't work.
[128:11.47]So if I do this... No, I'm trying to stop it!
[128:17.53]I need to attach this to that.
[128:19.61]Okay, I see what you're doing.
[128:21.95]Alright, you need to- hmm.
[128:25.89]Does anybody need a box?
[128:31.66]Maybe, actually.
[128:35.62]We need to bounce the water.
[128:36.80]I have to freeze something here for Ashley to stand on.
[128:42.11]I- I think I- I think I know what needs to happen.
[128:46.30]I think you might actually need to have to do a loop around with your rope to make the water come down the rope.
[128:53.19]No.
[128:53.69]I don't think so.
[128:58.06]Oh, wait.
[128:59.92]Or actually, you can get into it.
[129:02.72]Okay, yeah.
[129:03.16]You just have to... You could probably... Yeah, now you just bounce it up there.
[129:09.70]It didn't open the gate or anything.
[129:11.32]Well, no, put the box back there and then turn this way.
[129:13.60]Oh, the wheels above us.
[129:14.56]Yeah, the wheels above you.
[129:15.88]Have the water go shoot up.
[129:19.28]Or you have Ashley just bounce it up from there, straight up.
[129:23.84]Are you muted, Ashley?
[129:26.56]It's not quite far enough, but hold on.
[129:28.84]I can do this.
[129:29.38]Is it going to work?
[129:32.21]It worked last time.
[129:37.21]Come on.
[129:37.85]Can you bring this box in here so she can stand on it?
[129:41.27]Yeah.
[129:43.19]What?
[129:43.51]Why?
[129:43.97]No, I can't.
[129:44.69]Look at this.
[129:47.05]Box denied.
[129:48.63]I'm trying to think of what... It's like bouncing the same droplet over and over.
[130:00.25]Yeah, can you stand on the box?
[130:03.16]No.
[130:03.64]Can she stand on the box?
[130:06.08]Not while he's holding it.
[130:07.00]Not while he's holding it.
[130:14.90]Got the gem.
[130:16.84]Can you just do it?
[130:18.86]Just, hold on, don't do it.
[130:20.52]Just keep it, no, no, no.
[130:21.94]Keep it like, um... Tilt it, yeah.
[130:26.24]You just had it for a second.
[130:31.84]You guys, it's physics.
[130:35.84]Get wet, Will.
[130:37.04]Come on.
[130:37.36]I don't... I don't get it.
[130:40.14]I heard your rope doesn't do it.
[130:46.55]Now... I don't know, I just... Put the box down here and I'll stand on it.
[130:55.91]There it is.
[130:57.17]Kind of.
[131:02.05]Not strong enough.
[131:04.18]As intended.
[131:06.56]Almost.
[131:11.89]Is there a pipe here that can be frozen?
[131:14.45]I don't think so.
[131:16.13]Unless it's like this.
[131:17.73]What if you freeze that where it's coming out of?
[131:21.05]Will it come out of the other pipe or something?
[131:22.77]I don't know.
[131:23.13]There's some weird... No!
[131:24.19]No!
[131:25.77]Sorry.
[131:27.93]No.
[131:29.27]I just froze that.
[131:31.87]Wait, shoot ice at them again?
[131:33.91]Wait a minute, hold on.
[131:35.51]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a second.
[131:38.11]Give me the box, give me the box, give me the box, give me the box.
[131:41.11]No, yeah, you didn't have to do that too.
[131:42.75]Give me the box, give me over there.
[131:44.47]Give me the other side.
[131:46.92]Okay.
[131:47.90]Get, oh fuck.
[131:49.22]Do it again?
[131:52.65]Alright.
[131:53.36]Now... Now, get... Get me to the box.
[131:58.36]Hold on.
[131:58.98]Wait, wait.
[131:59.26]I don't... No weight on here.
[132:01.70]I need to, like, get... I need to put this on top of... No!
[132:05.04]Stop!
[132:05.42]Why did you do that?
[132:07.69]What?
[132:07.97]You wanted the box, right?
[132:09.05]I need to... Okay.
[132:11.41]I thought you were going to attach it to my box.
[132:13.57]Get up there.
[132:16.41]Oh!
[132:20.38]Wow.
[132:21.24]This guy...
[132:23.07]This guy.
[132:26.33]This guy.
[132:28.87]This guy.
[132:29.47]He deserves a trophy.
[132:31.19]Do I?
[132:31.57]Take one.
[132:42.42]I can't do it.
[132:43.42]The ceiling's too low.
[132:45.22]He spawned inside of me.
[132:48.16]I'm done.
[132:48.76]I'm done.
[132:49.95]I'm not even, like, trying when we have fight sequences.
[132:52.33]I'm sorry.
[132:54.09]Oh, he said it.
[132:55.16]He said the name.
[132:56.10]I'm not even trying.
[132:57.24]There it is.
[133:00.34]People have been, like, minus twoing my, like, shitty dad jokes this whole time.
[133:05.64]+2.
[133:06.20]Can we get +2?
[133:07.00]That's unbelievable that I'm even seeing even five plus twos for that.
[133:10.70]That's unbelievable.
[133:20.53]I'm ready to go in.
[133:21.57]Okay, now I'm going to freeze this.
[133:27.28]And let this go.
[133:30.62]I'm prepared to enter the room.
[133:33.58]I need a box.
[133:38.26]We all had the same exact idea.
[133:39.92]That's funny.
[133:40.52]Jump on me.
[133:41.82]I want to be the box.
[133:42.36]Yes.
[133:43.26]Oh, cool.
[133:51.36]Is that a different?
[133:52.42]That one's like yellow.
[133:54.36]Why is this one yellow?
[133:56.84]Oh, it is.
[133:57.92]No, it's not.
[133:58.74]Is it?
[133:59.26]I got them all.
[134:01.00]Let's go.
[134:09.38]Let me attach this to that.
[134:12.95]Is that the wrong way?
[134:16.07]It's not turning.
[134:17.85]I think it has to go up, but hold on.
[134:20.09]Can I spin this?
[134:26.23]No!
[134:28.75]Can I pull this?
[134:29.93]I can't, like, pull this.
[134:34.97]Hold on.
[134:36.15]Hold on.
[134:36.73]I mean, I'm... There we go.
[134:38.45]You got it.
[134:39.27]But we have to open the door.
[134:40.45]The door is open.
[134:41.11]No, it's not open.
[134:42.28]Wait.
[134:43.72]Should I... What?
[134:44.96]Okay.
[134:45.64]Cool.
[134:51.82]Sooner or later.
[134:59.14]Is that too far?
[135:04.70]Sorry.
[135:05.85]Hey, you know how, like, I lift the box up for you and then you go ahead?
[135:16.33]Can you, like, can you get used to roping them and maybe helping a wizard out?
[135:19.73]Maybe.
[135:21.58]Maybe.
[135:25.32]We need to pull this over here.
[135:32.20]Alright.
[135:32.80]Do it.
[135:33.26]Lift it up.
[135:34.45]You're on it.
[135:34.95]I can't.
[135:40.51]Can you get this?
[135:41.99]Here we go.
[135:42.69]Thank you.
[135:43.25]We have to... Yeah.
[135:43.63]Yeah.
[135:55.85]How are you here?
[135:57.31]What?
[135:58.45]I've been here.
[135:59.79]I've been here.
[136:00.51]Alright, can I get a little bit of a pop?
[136:08.70]Oh, you want a little bit of a pop?
[136:09.90]Oh, you got... Oh, you got... Oh, she's the box.
[136:12.12]I'm the box.
[136:12.88]Alright, but then how do you get up here?
[136:14.18]We need to help... Whoa, there you go.
[136:17.62]Uh-oh.
[136:18.27]Fighting!
[136:18.61]This is my realm.
[136:22.39]You shot my box out of the air.
[136:23.57]I did?
[136:26.01]He's anti-airing my box.
[136:28.79]Well, now he's frozen.
[136:30.15]Freeze.
[136:30.91]Head box.
[136:31.37]Oh, he's off the screen.
[136:38.25]Sick.
[136:39.35]No!
[136:41.77]The platform is gone.
[136:45.32]Yep.
[136:46.20]I feel like there's something else up here.
[136:49.20]Screenshot that and read it later.
[136:52.64]Nope.
[136:54.51]think we should be reading other people's mail it's kind of weird it was mail for you but we got like this really important looking letter in the mail for somebody else oh we still haven't given it oh yeah it's like open immediately why did that just actually lawsuit letter sent to us for someone else oh my god alright there it's not my fault the postman like doesn't understand what numbers are
[137:25.16]Yeah.
[137:28.61]Isn't that the first thing you learn as a mailman?
[137:30.25]Dude, this is a long-ass level.
[137:35.63]Right?
[137:35.95]Uh, I can freeze that.
[137:37.71]Pull it back up.
[137:41.62]Put it in, like, a good spot.
[137:45.14]Oh.
[137:45.90]Okay.
[137:52.26]now I think I I think oh we're good nice I want that ability nope it looks like fun nope nice smash oh waiting for other players to continue waiting for just waiting for the drops of virgin blood there what did you get that's actually a lot
[138:19.23]It must be upsetting to see what happened while you were away.
[138:22.73]Just do them all.
[138:23.59]You have the changer.
[138:26.11]That's me!
[138:46.94]He said, do them all.
[138:47.88]I'm trying.
[138:49.50]No.
[138:50.64]You're wrong.
[138:52.40]There's one way out of here.
[138:54.74]I just, I give up.
[138:56.48]Hey!
[138:57.06]Fucking pope breaking the gym.
[139:04.77]Old reference.
[139:06.81]Skip.
[139:07.69]Skip.
[139:10.13]Skip.
[139:10.75]Hey!
[139:13.29]Oh no, are we here again?
[139:15.23]I'm telling you, the whole game is one just long level.
[139:19.09]We're in the dream world.
[139:20.26]Jerm was the only one not doing voices today.
[139:25.96]Are you sure?
[139:43.97]I can't actually just spit all of my screen.
[139:48.91]That was so, so impatient.
[139:56.69]Teleportation?
[140:03.34]Ooh, that's cool.
[140:04.64]Wow.
[140:05.56]Cool.
[140:06.58]Wait.
[140:09.12]This is where it gets a little weird.
[140:17.53]You good?
[140:19.21]I'm good.
[140:20.81]Wow, the castle's brand new.
[140:22.21]It has all the old cobwebs back.
[140:28.77]I stopped listening to everything he was saying like 40 minutes ago.
[140:32.16]I don't know what he said.
[140:33.36]Get out of my dream.
[140:38.40]Didn't think so.
[140:44.49]He's just a Charlie Brown adult right now.
[140:46.89]I have no idea what he's saying.
[140:52.63]Can me and Ashley... Can me and Ashley just do this puzzle?
[140:57.59]I'm gonna freeze it.
[141:00.67]Does that freeze?
[141:03.41]What about down below?
[141:09.16]The door doesn't stay open.
[141:13.82]Here, we're gonna do this way.
[141:15.14]Ashley, get off of it and you're muted again.
[141:17.57]Can I freeze it when it's open or closed?
[141:19.43]I'm not muted.
[141:21.03]Yeah, you are.
[141:23.09]There's a double mirror.
[141:32.41]No, it's my box puzzle.
[141:35.47]Fine, it's your box puzzle.
[141:37.67]I didn't need you.
[141:39.27]Something in the water.
[141:41.24]Whoa!
[141:45.39]Oh, don't touch the- the floor's lava!
[141:46.97]The floor's lava!
[141:47.75]It is, I just proved it.
[141:51.99]Uh-oh, you gotta pull this table.
[141:55.49]Oh!
[141:55.97]Vote up all those!
[141:56.53]Oh, you want them?
[141:59.55]Yeah!
[142:03.04]Fuck!
[142:03.44]Too far.
[142:03.96]I am- No!
[142:06.16]Okay, now I need something to attach this to in front of us.
[142:10.06]In front of us?
[142:10.44]Something like that.
[142:11.22]Because then you're going to move it.
[142:12.63]Check this out.
[142:13.23]Now you're going to move it forward.
[142:15.59]Oh.
[142:16.59]I thought that was going to be it.
[142:18.77]I mean... Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[142:22.73]Connect... Just connect it to the box.
[142:25.13]Not the hook.
[142:26.75]Unconnect hook.
[142:29.29]Okay.
[142:30.08]Now connect box.
[142:32.02]Well, you said connect to the box.
[142:33.56]Yeah, now connect box.
[142:35.10]Okay.
[142:35.30]Okay.
[142:36.83]Are you trying to make a bridge with this?
[142:38.77]Yeah, I'm trying to make a bridge.
[142:40.25]Okay, well you go, then move it forward.
[142:42.55]Ashley's on top of it, I can't.
[142:44.21]I'm on the box, you can't do it.
[142:46.06]Hold on, if I attach it to this, you... What the fuck just happened there?
[142:51.66]That's another box, yeah.
[142:52.46]Okay, now... Damn, we don't need any of this shit.
[143:00.02]I just had a plan, and you know what'll work.
[143:02.05]I mean, what if you don't even... If you don't even need my box...
[143:08.89]I need another weight.
[143:10.90]No, that's fine.
[143:11.38]Oh, fuck.
[143:14.12]It didn't go all the way.
[143:16.52]I already have that one iced.
[143:19.56]But I guess I'll do this one instead.
[143:23.57]Oh, shit.
[143:26.79]Oh!
[143:27.31]What the fuck was that?
[143:28.69]Ow.
[143:29.09]That was me.
[143:30.43]I helped.
[143:37.45]Some of the portals can be levitated and rotated.
[143:40.41]Hey!
[143:41.39]New mechanic for you!
[143:44.01]Alright, now just do the portal thing.
[143:50.73]You have to do the portal thing at least once.
[143:54.10]Let me go!
[143:57.32]Flip it over.
[144:02.46]Oh, it doesn't work.
[144:09.48]You gotta go into the other one.
[144:10.89]Yeah, but how do we do that?
[144:12.39]Hey, we need a box.
[144:14.08]Lookit, this is a total wizard level.
[144:15.62]Look at this.
[144:16.57]Alright, you ready?
[144:17.91]How come my ability is only for one level?
[144:22.42]It's probably introducing it, so it's going to be here for the rest of the time.
[144:28.00]I just want to be cool.
[144:29.94]Are we opening this door?
[144:32.34]You need to move that.
[144:35.08]I can't.
[144:35.94]Only some portals can be moved.
[144:37.78]No, no.
[144:37.94]What about the box through the wall?
[144:39.06]Can you move the box through the wall?
[144:41.61]Thank you.
[144:43.49]And then Ashley needs to...
[144:46.22]You need to be lower.
[144:47.48]I don't know how you can get it up, though.
[144:48.96]I can do it higher.
[144:54.10]What?
[144:54.84]Freeze it.
[144:55.42]You can't freeze airborne things.
[144:58.66]Higher.
[145:01.33]There we go.
[145:04.15]Then we can just get in?
[145:06.13]But why?
[145:06.95]Well, we can go top left.
[145:08.73]That was the whole reason there was a wall.
[145:11.37]No, actually charge through that.
[145:14.29]Charge through what?
[145:14.92]Like charge through the portal.
[145:16.92]Oh, okay.
[145:18.70]For some reason I thought that was too much to cross.
[145:22.72]I have no idea.
[145:25.96]Why did we move?
[145:30.32]I think these things spawned in.
[145:32.48]It took a long time to spawn.
[145:34.24]Where am I?
[145:34.78]Oh.
[145:37.30]Got him.
[145:43.62]Yeah.
[145:44.40]Alright.
[145:45.84]Freeze it.
[145:48.56]But this can be rotated though, right?
[145:51.98]Yeah.
[145:53.26]Yeah.
[145:58.16]I'll get it.
[146:00.34]I'll get it.
[146:01.96]I'll get it.
[146:02.70]It wasn't that funny.
[146:04.16]It wasn't that funny.
[146:05.02]It can't be rotated.
[146:06.80]So... Freeze it.
[146:08.70]I guess just... Sometimes it's just that simple, isn't it?
[146:17.01]sometimes it's that simple sometimes not every time but sometimes and it was funny I don't want to hear it alright this is your puzzle Steve here you go I'm gonna stand over here and hide and then blink and not help is she how spiteful she is you say like one thing one time and then she like holds it over you for the rest of your life that's why the marriage is my job but there's a cool thing over there
[146:48.57]This is a cool level.
[146:49.59]I just like the way it looks inside.
[146:50.79]Can I get a box so I can... Yeah, this is all you.
[146:56.26]This actually is, like, just a wizard portion of the game.
[147:00.32]Hold on.
[147:02.04]I'm confused.
[147:02.50]Alright, well, we'll see how long it takes for you to do it.
[147:08.92]Well, it look... Wait, wait, wait.
[147:10.08]Ashley, you're... I cannot freeze these, can I?
[147:17.72]If I can shoot through.
[147:18.52]I don't think that does anything for us right now.
[147:22.99]Where do I put it?
[147:23.81]My brain is broken right now.
[147:25.55]I can't think.
[147:26.25]Where do I put it?
[147:27.65]Alright.
[147:27.91]So, listen.
[147:29.31]Let me help you out here.
[147:30.35]So, okay.
[147:31.07]Flip it around.
[147:32.45]Hold on.
[147:32.93]I can't do it.
[147:33.37]It doesn't work that way, Ashley.
[147:35.17]Hold on.
[147:35.46]Someone's driving a car into my house.
[147:37.06]Give me a second.
[147:38.86]Okay.
[147:39.48]Hey, yeah.
[147:40.46]You just had it.
[147:42.08]Lower.
[147:43.90]Ashley, if you angle it.
[147:44.76]Yeah, angle it a little bit.
[147:46.72]Oh, that doesn't matter.
[147:47.81]Oh, it was working a second ago.
[147:49.15]Yeah, I can't do that.
[147:53.63]Oh, I can do that.
[147:54.73]Fuck, dude.
[147:59.47]Fuck, you guys are so bad at this game.
[148:01.61]Like, I'm missing dinner now.
[148:04.50]You don't deserve dinner.
[148:05.40]What is that even from?
[148:07.02]When did I say that?
[148:07.88]I had to have said that recently for you to capture it.
[148:09.96]That was a clip?
[148:12.40]Yeah.
[148:26.11]No, it was the be a toxic Overwatch player thing, right?
[148:29.81]You, like, want it to do it.
[148:31.17]Oh, yeah.
[148:31.84]And it was right before we had played, um... Dwarf game.
[148:36.80]Oh, no.
[148:37.08]Somebody actually dot-dot-dotted me.
[148:41.06]Oh.
[148:41.36]Well, I... Okay.
[148:42.19]I guess this works.
[148:45.23]Why does this game even bother with combat?
[148:48.00]You know what?
[148:48.46]That is actually a really good question.
[148:50.62]What's the point of even fighting stuff in this game?
[148:53.44]Filler.
[148:54.36]It's extreme filler, right?
[148:57.18]It breaks up the action a bit.
[149:00.34]Yes.
[149:01.36]I mean, if it was any way challenging, it'd be alright.
[149:05.62]But this game only has easy and normal.
[149:09.50]Alright, Steve.
[149:10.12]Look for four of them.
[149:11.11]This is your playground.
[149:13.17]Where is it going to?
[149:14.79]Oh, in there?
[149:17.28]Well, I have access to put, like, a rope bridge, so.
[149:22.41]There's one.
[149:22.95]Alright, so it has to stay.
[149:25.97]So, hold on.
[149:27.15]Do that again.
[149:27.55]Shit.
[149:30.07]Just keep jumping on my box.
[149:32.63]Sorry it's so tempting.
[149:34.23]I mean, I can't freeze the door?
[149:36.61]Just stack them up.
[149:38.21]So it's high enough.
[149:39.85]Just get another of these.
[149:42.39]Alright, just put the boxes on top of the boxes.
[149:46.55]Put boxes on top of the box.
[149:50.13]Yeah.
[149:51.13]And just stack them up, and then just make the angle right.
[149:54.57]But you gotta have it be the right one on the right angle.
[149:58.31]Oh, that doesn't work.
[150:01.00]Just have the... The third box has to be the one doing it.
[150:11.06]Oh, okay.
[150:11.64]So then wait.
[150:12.12]Hold on.
[150:17.14]just go up just climb up oh but what about you guys I mean I can put the rope up I guess it's still working I guess whatever dot dot dot this lore no there were things up there were there well I I'm sorry
[150:48.62]No elevator fight sequence, what are we gonna do?
[150:54.71]I'm gonna do fire on this one just to feel like it's cool.
[150:58.21]Yep.
[150:58.87]Never mind I'm glad it's the prince's nightmare.
[151:06.74]We just have to move There's a lot of secrets in this game though
[151:16.35]What do I do?
[151:16.63]You missed a door with a hook on it.
[151:20.15]A door with a hook that can be opened?
[151:23.54]Pull it.
[151:25.08]I'm pulling.
[151:30.50]Give me a boost.
[151:37.89]What do you mean? Like- oh I see what you mean.
[151:45.10]I don't think that works.
[151:46.65]That has always worked.
[151:48.17]It did in the past.
[151:50.87]It was for a second there, see?
[151:54.59]Why are we on different planes?
[151:57.42]Yeah, see, now it... Okay, never mind.
[152:01.96]But we have to get in here, though.
[152:03.96]We do have to get in here.
[152:05.58]It's taunting me.
[152:08.65]Put your shield up.
[152:17.74]No, I can't, like, yank it up.
[152:21.58]You... We were doing it before.
[152:24.60]But it made it in.
[152:25.84]Try to do the thing where you push me up again.
[152:27.26]I mean, it's kind of working a little.
[152:32.62]It's staying.
[152:33.14]Alright, keep going.
[152:35.80]Come on, game.
[152:38.28]Come on, game!
[152:39.40]Just brute force it.
[152:40.76]Alright, do it again.
[152:43.32]Alright, get in!
[152:44.72]Get in!
[152:45.86]Oh!
[152:46.84]Freeze it!
[152:48.37]Was that it?
[152:49.77]Freeze it!
[152:50.11]I think that was it.
[152:51.31]Freeze it!
[152:52.91]I got it.
[152:53.23]I think that was it.
[152:54.14]No, we can't even go in there.
[152:55.60]We can't even go in there.
[152:56.56]I froze the door closed.
[152:57.50]Good job.
[152:59.30]No, but this... We did that before, too.
[153:02.98]Oh, whatever.
[153:03.52]Someone else will get it one day.
[153:07.33]The next set of adventures.
[153:09.13]Yeah.
[153:09.97]Someone else will do it.
[153:11.79]Later.
[153:17.46]Alright, just- I'm just gonna do it regular.
[153:19.14]Ooh, how did- how did that- Okay, pull me off.
[153:24.76]That was- Wait, what?
[153:26.90]Oh, you've lowered the poison.
[153:34.91]But we didn't even go in here.
[153:36.11]Look at this stuff in here.
[153:37.01]What?
[153:37.99]Where?
[153:38.83]Give me this stuff.
[153:39.35]There's three, uh... I got him.

[153:44.93]Mm-hmm.
[153:58.53]Whoa.
[153:58.95]What?
[154:00.19]Okay, well, we're over here.
[154:02.24]And then I think now you have to spin this so we can jump into it and launch ourselves up.
[154:08.82]Mm-hmm.
[154:11.50]Look at that.
[154:12.60]Can you do it?
[154:13.02]Now you're thinking with Pottle.
[154:16.92]Now you have to go up this door and go to the right.
[154:19.54]Now you have to fight a wolf.
[154:23.95]A Nightmare Wolf.
[154:29.54]Fight a wolf.
[154:30.78]Whoa.
[154:31.32]What?
[154:31.52]What?
[154:33.04]Were you just doing that?
[154:34.66]Yeah.
[154:36.12]That's my cool ability that I unlock is moving the pointless enemies around.
[154:40.39]I froze it.
[154:41.65]Sorry.
[154:41.97]What are you trying to do here?
[154:55.94]Yeah, I can't put a box there.
[154:57.48]No box guy.
[154:58.68]Wait, wait, wait.
[155:00.37]You guys are now down there.
[155:02.95]And you get across.
[155:05.23]And then you can get across.
[155:06.85]And then I can get across because of this.
[155:09.47]I can grab this thing.
[155:11.46]Just give me a box for a second.
[155:17.84]Fuck.
[155:18.70]Fuck.
[155:19.26]You need to be on the ledge, I think.
[155:22.42]I have to make a bridge.
[155:25.09]Like that.
[155:25.45]Oopsie daisy.
[155:26.97]Oopsie.
[155:29.50]I can't really... Oh, now I can see.
[155:31.22]Oopsie.
[155:31.60]I don't know how to help you.
[155:35.90]Jerma probably does not remember that he can roll.
[155:38.60]I know how to help you.
[155:39.58]I can put a box on that.
[155:40.57]Wait, wait, wait.
[155:41.35]Why is that coming out like halfway?
[155:43.75]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[155:44.21]You put the box down there.
[155:45.21]Alright.
[155:45.43]Lift it up.
[155:46.47]Press button.
[155:48.07]Okay.
[155:48.35]Now wait.
[155:49.81]Hold on.
[155:50.11]This is going to be hard.
[155:52.59]Oh, you can just go down the second thing.
[155:54.83]That's what I'm trying to do.
[155:55.73]I forgot Jerma could roll too.
[155:57.31]Why does he get to roll?
[155:58.68]Okay.
[155:58.96]Now do it again.
[156:00.26]Thank you.
[156:01.66]Now.
[156:03.90]Thank you.
[156:05.54]No, no, no.
[156:05.86]Like, put it over here where I can do it.
[156:06.88]You can just rope from box to hook.
[156:10.75]What if it falls?
[156:12.47]Well, you look cooler that way.
[156:14.89]Yeah, I know.
[156:15.19]I can roll, but... I roll into a waterfall.
[156:20.51]Water... I don't know.
[156:21.31]I don't know.
[156:29.90]Yeah, how funny.
[156:30.72]How can you do that, huh?
[156:33.44]I mean, I know I have the roll, but the roll doesn't give me, like, extra... Like, I can roll like this.
[156:38.21]But if I... For instance, already, like, I just roll into the... I don't know.
[156:41.41]What are you guys saying?
[156:42.51]I want to roll.
[156:42.99]I've been rolling around the whole time.
[156:49.02]It doesn't give me, like, extra momentum.
[156:50.32]Alright.
[156:54.94]You do that again.
[156:55.66]I'm going to do the SpongeBob laugh again.
[156:57.26]And everyone's going to be pissed at you because you made that happen.
[157:00.00]I haven't heard you do the SpongeBob laugh.
[157:05.92]Oh my god, we have to have this hit all of them?
[157:08.04]That's... Come on.
[157:14.28]Oh, almost.
[157:15.86]Just make it... yeah.
[157:18.85]Okay.
[157:20.37]Oh, let's go.
[157:21.85]Look, it made a ladder.
[157:28.01]Alright.
[157:28.99]Cool, instead of moving boxes, I can move one other object.
[157:31.75]Uh, I'm both, I'm gonna, I'm gonna light this up, so it's gonna move.
[157:36.17]Oh, wait, right, right, that's how that works!
[157:40.11]We did it!
[157:40.53]See?
[157:45.11]I, uh... I can freeze it.
[157:48.69]Oh, you got it?
[157:51.03]Doesn't even need our help.
[157:53.29]He's a big boy.
[157:55.82]Guide the two light beams through the yellow crystals on the sides of the cube to combine them into a single, stronger beam.
[158:03.68]Interesting.
[158:04.32]Thanks, psychic voice.
[158:07.52]Oh, it does make a super beam.
[158:11.46]Burning.
[158:12.44]Oh.
[158:15.86]Oh, it all fell off, it looked like.
[158:17.62]Oh, no.
[158:29.62]It's the perfect time for the demon voice and he didn't do it.
[158:36.52]Yeah, it's true.
[158:38.58]What?
[158:38.76]We're all wizards!
[158:41.08]I don't even know how to use the wizard.
[158:46.69]Well, he only played through his tutorial twice.
[158:48.45]Oh no.
[158:55.95]A problem that I can't smash the head with?
[158:58.57]Alright, hold on.
[159:02.16]This... The middle thing can be moved.
[159:03.72]Alright, put... Come on.
[159:05.90]Put a spinner over here.
[159:09.68]Somebody guide the light.
[159:14.62]Yep.
[159:15.49]Okay.
[159:16.47]Now... What do we do with that thing?
[159:22.07]She's holding onto the edge.
[159:23.31]I can't rotate this one.
[159:33.86]I mean, it's going in, but... I think we have to do a super beam over there.
[159:40.63]Yeah.
[159:42.99]I don't... Okay.
[159:49.05]Oh.
[159:50.37]Ashley, you're just smashing a box.
[159:52.81]You're not helping.
[159:53.48]I'm not involved in this.
[159:55.70]Yeah, grab that one.
[159:57.54]And then... We have to turn... You can rotate that, right?
[160:02.54]Okay.
[160:06.87]Bring it forward.
[160:08.35]Oh, we have to do it to the cauldron.
[160:09.82]Yeah, it's going to go in the cauldron.
[160:10.68]See, like, it's got to end up shooting up.
[160:13.96]Oh.
[160:14.50]So then I can... He's just standing here watching us do this.
[160:20.66]They'll get it any minute now.
[160:23.42]They'll die of boredom.
[160:24.52]I thought we were aiming it at the wall.
[160:27.90]No.
[160:28.36]Don't worry.
[160:29.34]We're going to have to do this like two or three more times.
[160:31.18]I actually won't.
[160:34.42]What?
[160:34.64]I actually won't have to.
[160:38.02]I feel like more than two people... You're just like getting in the way.
[160:41.72]Come stand on the left and go take a shit or something.
[160:44.18]Oh, I do have to take a shit.
[160:46.43]I'll be back.
[160:48.63]Okay, hold on.
[160:51.13]Can you just move over to the right and I think I can do it.
[160:56.98]Well, how are you seeing that?
[160:59.72]It's gotta go up.
[161:01.50]You gotta put yours... You gotta be shooting it up.
[161:06.03]It's got to go up through the middle portal here.
[161:09.23]That thing's got to go over here.
[161:12.55]How do you rotate?
[161:14.73]Z and X. Okay, well, I'm using a key.
[161:17.97]I don't know, dude.
[161:19.03]I'm not using a controlly.
[161:22.03]So how would you... Maybe it has to be down here?
[161:29.12]Well, two beams have to hit it.
[161:31.40]Wait, how do we just have it?
[161:33.40]Come on, get rid of this.
[161:34.12]If we just... Get rid of this box.
[161:35.70]...have them both right here.
[161:37.88]Put this box in the cauldron.
[161:39.06]There you go.
[161:39.44]Right there.
[161:42.00]Nice job.
[161:42.44]Get to work.
[161:48.96]So this is aiming down.
[161:58.78]I actually left her fucking box in here.
[162:01.02]It's just in the way.
[162:03.56]It's just a box here.
[162:04.92]Alright, what about this?
[162:06.50]Can you do anything with that?
[162:09.79]Can you get, like, the double?
[162:11.87]Oh, no.
[162:14.11]Alright, what about if I grab this one?
[162:16.43]Anything happen when I do this?
[162:20.18]Alright, hold on.
[162:20.74]What about... Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[162:22.56]Can you do anything with that?
[162:25.04]Um, maybe... Check it out.
[162:27.12]Can you angle it with that one?
[162:28.98]I don't think so.
[162:29.70]Yeah, no, that's blocking them.
[162:31.10]They need to come all the way around.
[162:32.72]This one, you can't do it with this one here?
[162:33.99]Like in the center here?
[162:36.09]I'll hold this right there.
[162:38.05]This fucking box!
[162:42.81]Uh-oh, I'm back.
[162:45.01]What happened?
[162:45.77]Delete your box!
[162:47.63]Oh, shit.
[162:49.51]Uh, how?

[163:23.83]Oh, shit.
[163:25.35]Okay, well, hold on.
[163:26.25]Then this one has to go this way.

[163:53.38]And now you've got a double here.
[163:55.56]But it's got to be angled up.
[163:58.44]Put your box under this, Ash.
[164:00.74]What?
[164:02.75]Hold on, let's see.
[164:03.43]No, that's not going to do anything.
[164:07.51]Wait.
[164:11.53]Alright, let me hold that here.
[164:12.97]Because I don't know what the button is.
[164:16.14]I actually do not know what the button is.
[164:18.18]To rotate on control.
[164:19.44]Yeah, but if I put this here, it blocks.
[164:22.52]It's still lit up.
[164:23.00]Oh!
[164:23.06]To the right, to the right.
[164:24.58]I can do that, but then I can't aim it.
[164:26.04]Yeah, you can.
[164:27.12]Keep going to the right.
[164:29.68]You can only do that or that.
[164:30.90]Yeah, but how far can you go to the right?
[164:35.38]Can you go up?
[164:38.01]Oh, shit.
[164:38.77]Like, how close can you... This isn't gonna get it.
[164:42.53]Fuck!
[164:45.51]Um... Here, let me try that.
[164:48.29]Let me grab that.
[164:51.21]Wait a minute.
[164:51.83]What if you put a box under that?
[164:55.49]Well, I wanted to get this at a sideways angle to shoot up, but I guess you can't do it.
[164:58.41]So no matter what, this is going to have to be down here.
[165:01.62]That's the only thing that works.
[165:03.32]So a box has to be under there.
[165:09.22]Ashley, drop your box.
[165:14.76]Okay.
[165:15.97]Now, it's a question of...
[165:21.59]Moving this one.
[165:24.53]Hold on, let me see this.
[165:29.38]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[165:30.74]Because this is just shooting down.
[165:31.70]Yeah, and you can't rotate it.
[165:35.54]Yeah, move that one back to where it was.
[165:40.48]What if... Bring it all the way down?
[165:44.73]What does that do?
[165:47.03]It just shoots it into the ground.
[165:47.89]The poor chat is in pain.
[165:53.71]uh okay um yeah but if you do it like that then I this this witch is more patient than you guys
[166:21.09]Yeah, and this person's trying to kill us.
[166:23.55]So, come on.
[166:27.56]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[166:28.66]Hold on.
[166:29.96]Shoot into this.
[166:32.50]Can we do something with this?
[166:33.96]Why are we trying to shoot that into... Why don't we angle it?
[166:40.79]Why don't we angle the shot into the fucking bottom one?
[166:43.47]What do you mean?
[166:48.03]Why do we have to aim it and shoot it at an angle?
[166:52.71]Can you reflect the double beam?
[166:55.17]It's always... These are always right angles.
[166:57.96]Yeah, but we can reflect the super beam off of one of the mirrors.
[167:03.54]Right?
[167:05.82]Yeah.
[167:07.35]But the mirrors are always right angles, so this mirror always has to shoot up to get this thing.
[167:12.01]We can't have, like, a weird...
[167:14.51]I guess we could have like a half angle if we fucking slightly tilted it on another like there's no way that's the point just put super beam in the middle sure for it that's what I'm saying the super beam has to be in the middle actually wait wait wait wait drop everything drama drop it all drop it all the top left one has to change doesn't it
[167:43.86]I've got it!
[167:46.36]I've got it!
[167:47.08]Surefire was right!
[167:52.93]See, I didn't think that the Super Beam could open the cauldron.
[167:56.25]You're right.
[167:56.67]Level 3.
[167:56.97]That's what my hang-up was.
[167:59.91]Where'd we go?
[168:01.93]I don't fucking know, dude.
[168:04.40]It's tricky.
[168:07.08]Okay, so now...
[168:18.99]Alright, we got the super beam.
[168:25.07]It's a bull market now.
[168:26.33]Kill her!
[168:27.27]Burn her!
[168:28.23]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[168:32.39]You just gotta do that the other way.
[168:33.31]We're just gonna flip this whole thing.
[168:36.49]But you can't flip it.
[168:38.53]No, but if we just mirror what we just did.
[168:40.18]And then push this up.
[168:44.38]Well, then that shoots this into the ground.
[168:45.88]That's not mirrored.
[168:47.62]Short 4, what do we do?
[168:49.20]Short 4.
[168:58.63]Okay, wait, wait.
[168:59.19]Drop the thing you're moving around.
[169:00.49]That has to shoot your... It has to go down.
[169:03.29]It has to go up.
[169:04.49]Okay, so then... Alright, now it's open.
[169:08.25]Wait, wait, wait.
[169:08.76]Hold on.
[169:16.10]Now you should be able to angle it.
[169:17.20]If you go... Oh, there's two things that have to be lit up.
[169:20.88]Yeah, there's two things that have to be lit up.
[169:22.46]So if you... What if we move this one down a little?
[169:27.67]Like, can we... No.
[169:32.47]That one's not doing much.
[169:33.83]This one has to be...
[169:37.36]Alright, let me see.
[169:37.94]You know, Surefour's on it.
[169:39.88]Alright, Surefour, what do you think?
[169:41.56]Left down, he said.
[169:43.24]That's what I was just thinking, but I don't... You have to flip it twice.
[169:51.21]What happened to the Jerma stalk?
[169:52.63]When did he get a bunch of minus twos?
[169:55.39]Because us not being able to figure out a puzzle is a bad joke, apparently.
[170:01.46]I guess.
[170:02.48]I guess.
[170:02.84]Imagine being so jaded that, like, everything you watch is like, oh Jesus, let it go.
[170:09.72]I'm trying to see if I can get this at a sideways angle.
[170:14.92]Move right down.
[170:18.05]We can do more than one box.
[170:22.03]Left down and hit the yellow.
[170:23.27]Then move right down.
[170:31.04]Then what do we do?
[170:31.86]What do we do with this?
[170:35.04]It has to go all the way up to the top left.
[170:36.87]It's gotta, like, shoot into the top left.
[170:42.37]Here, here, here, here.
[170:43.11]I got it.
[170:43.41]I got it.
[170:43.77]I got it.
[170:49.12]Yeah, but now that has to be... This has to be mirrored the other way.
[170:51.88]Hold on.
[170:52.80]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[170:53.84]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[170:54.62]Don't, don't!
[170:54.90]Wait, wait, wait!
[170:55.30]Nobody move!
[170:56.80]Do exactly what you just did.
[170:58.02]There's one on the ground right here.
[171:00.01]Hold on.
[171:00.79]Get rid of this.
[171:02.09]How do I get rid of this fucking thing?
[171:05.33]Okay.
[171:05.85]Do exactly what you just did.
[171:14.15]Got it.
[171:19.28]Finally!
[171:26.42]Finally, you actually did it!
[171:28.12]-2!
[171:30.07]You fucking guys are so bad at this game.
[171:31.75]Like, I'm missing dinner now.
[171:47.06]Even the witch is talking shit.
[171:50.28]Well, she's a witch!
[171:51.54]Isn't that kind of what they do?
[171:52.57]That's her job.
[171:59.63]My family left me with nothing.
[172:01.95]No forwarding address, no letter, not even a postcard.
[172:06.18]They were more worried about the cat than me.
[172:08.98]Well, sometimes families are complicated.
[172:12.94]Where are you going now?
[172:16.35]I'll know when I get there.
[172:18.51]What was the whole thing with the, like, swimmies back then?
[172:21.67]You see, like, on his shoulders?
[172:22.99]Like, the big swimmies, the big, like, inflated pads?
[172:46.87]So made them look tougher Once the dream is that like a there's like a status symbol or something?
[172:52.87]The big shoulders.
[172:54.02]Yeah, like in blizzard Like the better you are at blizzard World of Warcraft the bigger your shoulders are Oh my god, he looks really weird without a helmet.
[173:03.24]Oh, how about we let the boy run?
[173:05.36]It's his life And it's not like we're getting anything out of this little field trip except a pass on the back from the wizards
[173:14.53]Uh, I think I have to go.
[173:15.65]I'm just double checking that.
[173:18.73]Where you going?
[173:20.27]D&D.
[173:21.29]I think it's time.
[173:23.84]Oh, you gotta go.
[173:24.50]Yes, it's time.
[173:26.04]Red Shore 4, he knows.
[173:27.24]He's there.
[173:27.72]He's one of the boys.
[173:28.40]Oh, right.
[173:30.66]Oh, no.
[173:31.34]Star's gotta get out of here.
[173:32.58]Star and Ashley gotta go.
[173:35.75]Alright, let me, uh, this is important, though, before you leave.
[173:38.67]Do you want to play this again?
[173:39.65]I do.
[173:40.95]I want to finish this game.
[173:41.85]Do you want to
[173:43.53]yeah yeah alright yeah uh weekend trine trip Tuesday trine whatever it is one day I'll unlock my second ability conjured a ball and then I'll finally unlock two objects
[174:02.24]trying tuesdays alright well I just really sincerely hope it'll let us pick up from where we stopped well I I keep saying saving in the top right I'm assuming that means it's saving the game right it's all up to Steve so it's always I've got all I can select level from this screen okay I'm gonna assume everything's great it says saving I'm going to continue quitting to desktop okay um and then I'm going to
[174:30.07]Um, you know, Merry Christmas on Jerma.
[174:32.27]I'm gonna wish you a Merry Christmas.
[174:33.76]Have fun at your, uh, at your sesh.
[174:36.50]I'm gonna have a Dungeons & Dragons sesh.
[174:39.12]Cool.
[174:39.76]Uh, you know, I gotta go, but Jerma's gonna play some old Atari game you never heard of, I think.
[174:45.87]And you're gonna be like, wow, this is, he's such a boomer.
[174:50.19]It'll be great.
[174:51.83]I know, that actually sounds like a pretty good idea.
[174:53.59]They got an Atari, like, 2600 stream.
[174:56.35]Like, play one of the oldest existing football games that were, like, on the Nintendos.
[175:01.81]That's pretty cool.
[175:02.22]You press A for all buttons for all actions.
[175:05.34]Hut, hut.
[175:06.20]It's hut, hut, hike.
[175:07.70]A, A, A. Pass A. Run to goal A. I'll dig E.T.
[175:13.74]out of a landfill somewhere and play that, too, I guess.
[175:16.40]Okay, yeah.
[175:17.58]Maybe.
[175:18.60]But, hey, see you next Sunday for Trying Sundays.
[175:22.31]Yeah.
[175:22.61]See you.
[175:22.89]Alright.
[175:23.47]See you.
[175:23.93]See you later, guys.
[175:25.80]That was Star and Ashley.
[175:28.24]Both very fun, cool people.
[175:31.00]And I... I'm going to give you an unfortunate circumstance here.
[175:37.85]I have to leave.
[175:40.57]I'm going to go too.
[175:42.49]I'm starting to feel a little strange downstairs.
[175:47.79]So I have to go.
[175:51.47]I will be live tomorrow.
[175:53.43]This is actually the end of the stream.
[175:55.21]I do have to leave.
[175:59.31]So, I'm sorry.
[176:01.04]But it's okay, because like I said, there's going to be less time on stream, but there's going to be more days.
[176:06.50]So, I'll be live tomorrow.
[176:09.06]I'll be live tomorrow at the same time, so around like 1 or 2.
[176:12.10]Tomorrow, I'm going to start the thing.
[176:19.17]We took a nice little break from horror shit.
[176:24.47]So, tomorrow, we're going to go to the thing.
[176:29.24]Should be interesting.
[176:30.56]Same time.
[176:34.62]He hates streaming.
[176:36.38]I still think that's funny.
[176:39.20]But yeah, we'll try.
[176:40.22]It's fun.
[176:41.62]It's fun just to play a game sometimes.
[176:46.77]Brings me back.
[176:48.34]You know, when the three of us played games.
[176:51.14]So you'll see Tron again next weekend.
[176:53.10]I'm sure we'll probably get somewhere close to the end.
[176:54.90]What is it, like an eight, ten hour game?
[176:56.44]Something like that?
[176:59.08]I think that sounds like a plan to me.
[177:01.50]But I'm not going to leave just yet.
[177:03.38]I'm going to just be right back for a minute.
[177:06.62]I'm going to get some water.
[177:08.98]And I'll come back and we'll do the bits.
[177:11.54]And then I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[177:13.70]I'll see you guys really soon.
[177:15.89]Be right back.
[179:12.07]sound yeah I'm here thankfully I've been on this medicine for like a week and after like eight to ten days I don't think I'm gonna have to be taking it anymore so uh we'll go back to normal in probably like another four or five days I would assume
[179:38.10]We'll see.
[179:38.36]I don't know.
[179:38.90]Maybe I'll talk to my doctor and he might be... Maybe he says, no, you stay on it.
[179:42.72]I don't know.
[179:45.62]But... See you guys tomorrow.
[179:47.82]We'll play The Thing.
[179:48.50]I still have to do Parappa the Rapper and Parappa the Rapper 2.
[179:53.68]And... Talking about PlayStation 1 stuff.
[180:00.87]I have Bushido Blade and Bushido Blade 2.
[180:09.86]So that should be a lot of fun.
[180:11.28]I remember those games being a lot of fun.
[180:18.56]Those games are awesome.
[180:28.42]Dramacycle's still not there.
[180:30.07]Not yet.
[180:33.09]When's Rhythm Heaven?
[180:33.97]When I get a DS that I can mess with.
[180:40.10]Or I'll find another way.
[180:44.24]But let's go back to earlier.
[180:45.72]We had Sticks Renegade, 250.
[180:49.23]When is Dead Rising?
[180:51.25]After that, we've got The Thing.
[180:55.09]However, I might not even beat The Thing.
[180:57.99]I don't know.
[180:58.29]It depends on how it plays out.
[181:01.54]But...
[181:03.43]The Thing, I've got Siren for PS2, we've got both the Parappa games, and Bushido Blade and Bushido Blade 2.
[181:11.66]After that, then you're looking at probably Dead Rising.
[181:19.98]And then after that, we'll see.
[181:22.17]I mean, the Halloween stream's gonna happen somewhere in there too.
[181:26.71]But, uh, Sticks Renegade, thanks for the $2.50.
[181:29.96]Any chance you play Crash Team Racing one day?
[181:33.42]Nitro-fueled.
[181:34.88]I know you like driving and games.
[181:36.62]I saw Vinny play it and it was hilarious seeing him rage at the game.
[181:40.76]It's way better than Mario Kart.
[181:42.89]I have never played any of the games besides Sonic Racing.
[181:48.59]I've never played any other racing game that was not Mario Kart.
[181:52.59]A cartoon racing game.
[181:55.60]And everyone's played Cruisin' USA.
[181:57.20]I mean, everyone has.
[181:59.95]Well, Garfield Kart was a joke.
[182:01.47]I played that for like 32 seconds.
[182:04.63]Simpsons Hit and Run.
[182:05.43]That's not a racing game.
[182:07.87]That's like a GTA game.
[182:17.94]Every mission is a racing.
[182:20.14]Yeah, but it's not like a 3, 2, 1.
[182:21.26]Race the 12 people with you.
[182:26.09]It's not like a cartoon racing game where you race on tracks.
[182:32.76]That's like a Grand Theft Auto clone.
[182:35.88]I mean, you can race in Grand Theft Auto, but Grand Theft Auto is not like a cartoon racing game.
[182:43.78]You can do them.
[182:46.73]There was a count- Alright, you guys know what I'm talking about.
[182:52.67]You know what I'm saying.
[182:59.88]I do.
[183:00.28]Good.
[183:00.66]At least one person does.
[183:02.10]Two people do.
[183:03.66]A cart game.
[183:04.42]There you go.
[183:05.60]Thank you for the help.
[183:08.28]But I don't know.
[183:09.04]Maybe.
[183:14.03]Time GTA game.
[183:16.83]Maybe one day if there's something to do.
[183:19.45]Nothing else to do or whatever.
[183:20.37]If I don't have any plans or anything.
[183:22.94]But thank you, StixRenegade.
[183:23.90]Thank you, Elizabeth, for the 250.
[183:26.48]So, after having Um Jammer Lammy's soundtrack on my mind since yesterday, I stumbled across that in Stage 6 of the worst song in the concert hall with the weird green alien.
[183:36.20]It was actually changed for the US version of the game, where in the US version, your belt gets stuck on the door and you go back in time.
[183:43.45]However, in the Japanese version, you get hit by a car, you die and go to hell.
[183:49.81]Yeah, actually, I remember we were talking about that yesterday.
[183:55.48]Why is that such a... I don't know why that's such a big deal for the U.S.
[183:59.26]censors.
[184:03.38]That... why?
[184:04.56]That's weird.
[184:06.25]Of all the things, like, there's so many, like, fucked up, violent, crazy games over here?
[184:16.86]That's the one that, you know, you have to censor?
[184:23.43]They wanted the US version to appeal to more younger kids.
[184:29.65]I guess.
[184:32.89]Yeah, but I don't know if I... Don't they, like, go to hell in a Teen Titans episode?
[184:41.62]Yeah, that pregnancy level really appealed to the kids.
[184:46.64]Right?
[184:46.88]Like, what?
[184:48.10]Why is that the... That's fucked... That's true, yeah.
[184:51.62]That's fucked up.
[184:59.47]There's a Disneyland ride that ends with you going to hell.
[185:05.86]Almost every cartoon from the last hundred years has an episode with a devil or something.
[185:09.56]Yeah.
[185:11.04]Whatever.
[185:12.48]But, yeah.
[185:13.46]Thank you, Elizabeth.
[185:14.92]Thank you, Toastfart, for the 500 vits.
[185:24.45]Thank you SirK9 for the 300 vids.
[185:26.11]Jerma, I saw this in a recommended... I saw this in a recommended on YouTube on one of your vids and I thought you'd find it funny.
[185:35.31]Let's find out.
[185:36.19]What do you mean you found this was in recommended?
[185:46.11]You got a tenth of a second.
[185:49.37]This is a different YouTube link than the one from last night.
[185:52.47]Don't start this shit.
[185:56.07]Thank you, Wreckersed for the 250.
[186:01.31]Hey Jeremy, inspired by the carnival stream, I went out and got this done.
[186:07.28]Thanks, Jeremy.
[186:08.00]Wait, you got a tat?
[186:09.30]This is a tattoo?
[186:13.42]Are you serious?
[186:16.64]Hold on a second.
[186:19.35]Wow.
[186:22.67]Why?
[186:23.29]I'm a little confused, though.
[186:27.21]Because... Why did you get a... You got a tattoo of me.
[186:31.14]That's weird.
[186:33.48]I mean, like, that's... That's a tattoo of me.
[186:43.90]I mean, it's cool.
[186:44.66]Yeah, I'm showing it right now.
[186:45.87]I don't know why you got a tattoo of my face.
[186:49.47]Let's see.
[187:03.62]That's actually a really, like, cool tattoo.
[187:13.82]It's an EU date.
[187:17.89]That's great.
[187:21.01]That's... I love it.
[187:25.83]That, you know what I love?
[187:26.73]I love tattoos that are really just simple and like basic tattoos.
[187:34.18]Because that, you know, it's like a small little piece, right?
[187:37.50]You know what I mean?
[187:39.24]I like the small tattoos, the little ones.
[187:44.40]That just like, you know, hey, look at that.
[187:45.76]I got that.
[187:46.28]Oh, wow, that's cool.
[187:47.10]Look at that.
[187:50.28]So it is a tattoo of you.
[187:53.16]I kind of walked into that one, didn't I?
[187:54.42]But it's alright.
[187:56.00]That's an awesome tattoo, Wreck.
[187:58.39]Thank you for sharing it with everybody here.
[188:02.13]And thank you for the $2.50.
[188:02.83]Appreciate it.
[188:06.80]Cool tattoo.
[188:09.52]Thank you, Generate Blue, for the 300 bits.
[188:11.76]Hey, Jeremy.
[188:12.94]Just wanted to give you some bits for the quality entertainment you provide.
[188:16.14]Thanks for the streams, and thanks specifically, especially for pulling back the starting time, as it's severely easier to catch your streams now, even if I gotta go to work early the next day.
[188:26.86]Thank you for the 300 bits.
[188:30.04]Appreciate the kind message.
[188:31.12]And yes, the reason why I pulled it back is because even I started to see that as the streams, obviously not this one, but the average stream time has increased over the last couple of years.
[188:43.59]And moving to Pacific time, when a stream is six, seven plus hours, on average, it gets so late for everybody else that I don't want people to have to stay up to like three or four o'clock in the morning every time.
[188:59.36]So, the, like, 1 to 2 p.m.
[189:02.02]start, I think, is a perfect time.
[189:08.50]I don't think I'm going to change the time of the stream again.
[189:17.69]EST is crying.
[189:19.79]What do you mean?
[189:21.23]EST, 2, 3, 5 o'clock?
[189:22.65]6 o'clock?
[189:23.47]Eastern start?
[189:26.37]And that's, like, prime time, isn't it?
[189:33.24]That's like, you know, 6, 7 p.m.
[189:34.28]when we really get going.
[189:40.08]I used to start my streams at 7 Eastern.
[189:44.86]Which was about 4 o'clock Pacific.
[189:47.62]And then when I came over here to Vegas, it was... I obviously was not going to start at 7 Pacific.
[189:56.16]Because that would just be too late, I think, for everybody.
[189:57.82]Let's see...
[190:02.49]But yeah, I like it too.
[190:03.63]I think it's doing well.
[190:05.33]And it'll stay.
[190:08.15]But thank you, GenerateBlue.
[190:10.51]Thanks for watching the stream.
[190:13.14]Vilemi, thanks for the thousand bits.
[190:15.08]$10 ending the stream because he's stinky.
[190:21.82]Thank you for the thousand bits.
[190:23.34]Appreciate it.
[190:24.56]FreudianWeapon, thanks for the 500 bits.
[190:26.25]No message, just 500 bits.
[190:27.61]Thank you.
[190:29.83]Let's get the credits on this little short stream.
[190:34.56]We actually can move from here to here.
[190:38.26]Is there a camera on?
[190:38.98]No.
[190:41.14]I just ducked.
[190:42.72]This is the camera section.
[190:50.50]Thanks, everybody, for summoning me from hell.
[190:54.72]Appreciate it.
[190:56.64]Thanks for supporting the stream.
[190:57.82]Seriously.
[191:04.37]And thank you for writing with me again for the 500 bits.
[191:08.74]CVFD, thanks for the thousand bits.
[191:11.18]Great stream as always, Jerma, thank you.
[191:15.04]Yeah, it's... It was a fun one.
[191:19.00]It was just hanging out with my friends.
[191:25.14]Sometimes I have some of the most fun when I'm just chilling, playing a game.
[191:29.17]Just talking about random stuff.
[191:33.23]I've been having a lot of fun on stream.
[191:35.61]Not that I wasn't having it before, but I've been having like a ton of fun.
[191:40.63]The last like six months.
[191:45.51]And like I said, it's not even like, oh, I wasn't, you know, seven months ago.
[191:49.32]Wow, I really was.
[191:50.34]I hate streaming.
[191:53.00]No, I think there's just been a lot of fun things going on recently.
[192:00.18]You ever get burnt out?
[192:01.93]Nope.
[192:03.27]Because I take a lot of time off.
[192:05.68]That's by design.
[192:09.76]I take at least two days off a week, at least two or three days off a week to make sure that that doesn't happen.
[192:22.86]I mean, for the most part, the stream is live four times a week, three or four times a week sometimes.
[192:36.62]I think it's important to take a time off.
[192:41.72]Not just to take care of stuff in your life, but it lets you unplug a little.
[192:51.41]And I can continue to have fun on this stream and go back and forth with you guys and have a good time because it's... I have time to be away from it too.
[193:13.72]How does it feel to die to third wheel?
[193:20.40]So I appreciate streaming more because I do it less.
[193:32.18]And that's the way it's going to be and that's the way it always will be.
[193:40.67]But yeah, it's kind of the way it is, right?
[193:46.02]He does hate it.
[193:50.76]No, I don't.
[193:52.82]But thank you for the kind message.
[193:59.20]Well, actually, that was Vilemi was the last message.
[194:00.86]They said, ending stream because he's stinky.
[194:05.43]No, it was CVFD, right?
[194:08.03]Great stream as always.
[194:08.75]Yeah, thank you.
[194:12.01]Huh?
[194:12.19]What does that mean?
[194:12.93]Willowonkinging?
[194:39.58]Yeah, no, it is fun.
[194:41.08]You'll see it again.
[194:41.84]We'll complete it.
[194:43.04]If it takes another stream or two.
[194:46.36]We will do the three triners again.
[194:48.20]You'll see it.
[194:52.67]Thank you, Gnarly.
[194:53.21]Appreciate it.
[194:53.91]Vilemi, thanks for the thousand bits.
[194:55.41]Jerma lied about Jerma Psycho.
[194:56.77]I never promised Jerma Psycho.
[194:58.81]I said it would be there maybe eventually, but I wasn't going to give a time frame on it.
[195:03.38]I'm looking for the right image.
[195:07.60]Yeah, I said it's going to be here, but I didn't say it'll be here tomorrow.
[195:13.56]We got figs?
[195:15.38]Ooh.
[195:18.04]Nice.
[195:23.82]That's actually awesome.
[195:25.38]I can't wait to eat a fig.
[195:28.95]Or a fig spread, maybe.
[195:30.47]I have to be careful, though.
[195:37.09]Well, I'm at home.
[195:39.25]I'm fine.
[195:40.57]Fig Newtons are the best cookies.
[195:42.23]You know what?
[195:42.57]Here's the crazy thing.
[195:43.67]Fig Newtons are the best cookies that you never buy.
[195:49.00]I don't know.
[195:49.98]What's with that?
[195:50.98]Why don't you just get them?
[195:53.38]I love Fig Newtons, but I don't think I've ever purchased them.
[195:57.36]Don't ask me why.
[195:59.56]You always get the shitty cookies that you know that you're not going to eat very many of, but I would eat the whole box of Fig Newtons.
[196:08.13]Alright, the next time I go to the grocery store, I'm going to buy Fig Newtons.
[196:14.12]Or I'll do a 24-hour stream.
[196:15.42]How about that one?
[196:20.68]Yeah.
[196:25.03]And I'll eat one on stream, just so you can know.
[196:26.89]You can prove it.
[196:30.99]But thank you, Vilemi, for the thousand bits.
[196:35.18]Thank you, Tay, for the $2.50.
[196:36.18]Hey, Jerma, love tonight's stream.
[196:37.78]Thanks for being here.
[196:40.83]Thanks for hanging out.
[196:41.97]Thanks for the $2.50 as well.
[196:44.75]Keith King, thanks for the $2.50.
[196:46.13]Are you still planning on playing more Katamari games?
[196:49.37]We love Katamari for the PS2.
[196:50.59]It's my favorite game, and I'd love to see my favorite streamer play it.
[196:54.64]Yes.
[196:56.62]I, at some point, am going to try to do at least a couple more of the Katamari games, because those streams are a lot of fun.
[197:06.74]I did the first one all in one stream, right?
[197:09.32]I think that's the only one I played.
[197:12.31]But that's another game that's fun just to play and just chill and hang out and just talk about random shit.
[197:19.84]So.
[197:22.06]You'll see it again.
[197:22.94]I'll do more of the series.
[197:25.52]Because those games are really fun.
[197:28.06]Just not right now.
[197:28.84]Probably not until somewhere in November or something.
[197:30.56]Because all of October is... I've got a bunch of stuff that's just lined up, ready to go.
[197:40.01]Hey, Ishanji, thanks for the thousand bits to end it out here.
[197:44.55]They say, ADHD family represent.
[197:50.16]Yeah, I mean, I got it.
[197:53.72]I do have it.
[197:55.98]And it can be... It can be kind of hard to dance around.
[198:05.21]But, you know, whatever.
[198:06.41]Do what you gotta do.
[198:09.23]Thank you so much for the thousand bits.
[198:10.57]Appreciate it.
[198:15.09]And you know what that means.
[198:16.51]We've reached the end to our short trying stream.
[198:20.91]I am going to go and take care of myself a little bit
[198:25.73]Maybe eat a fig.
[198:28.36]And go do some stuff.
[198:31.26]I'll see you tomorrow.
[198:32.56]Same time.
[198:32.98]See you soon.
[198:41.68]The thing begins tomorrow.
[198:46.00]Have a great rest of your night.
[198:47.26]Or afternoon.
[198:47.92]It's still pretty early.
[198:52.09]See you later.
[198:53.33]Good night, guys.
[199:02.47]Somebody's upset about something.
[199:05.63]Good night.
[199:32.99]Thank you.
