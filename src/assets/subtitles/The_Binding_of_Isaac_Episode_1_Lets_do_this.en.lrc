[00:06.98]Hey, what's happening guys?
[00:10.17]Jerma here with The Binding of Isaac!
[00:14.06]Now, I'm gonna do a sort of Let's Play of this game.
[00:17.48]I don't really want to call it a Let's Play, because this game is friggin' hard.
[00:22.27]So... Gonna do as much of it as I can, probably at least three or four videos.
[00:27.97]Try and get through the at least first three or four levels.
[00:31.43]So we'll see how it goes.
[00:32.37]If you don't know what this game is, this game is made by the same guy that did Super Meat Boy.
[00:37.93]And I loved Super Meat Boy, so I gave this game a try.
[00:40.88]I got a lot of PMs, a lot of comments saying, hey, you should play The Binding of Isaac.
[00:44.53]So I said, abso-freaking-lutely, dude, let's do it.
[00:48.16]All live commentary, by the way.
[00:49.94]So we'll see if I can freak out or not.
[00:51.38]I've already played this game a little bit at Burgah Boy's house.
[00:54.39]So I sort of know what to expect, I guess.
[00:57.77]But it's a very twisted game, as you can see.
[01:01.49]You're a baby that shoots crying eyes of death.
[01:06.22]So we'll see how good this goes.
[01:09.64]Get out of here, Beetle.
[01:11.16]Also, this game can be very, very much attributed to games like StarTropics for the NES.
[01:17.42]If you've never played StarTropics, it's a game where you went room to room, dungeon crawler style.
[01:23.71]And hold on, I gotta go through.
[01:25.41]Actually, I'm not gonna waste my key.
[01:28.03]But it's a game where you went through dungeon style just like this.
[01:30.99]You could also say this is just like The Legend of Zelda 2.
[01:34.61]Takes a lot from those types of games.
[01:37.35]Alright, let's see here.
[01:39.32]And like I said, the game is very twisted.
[01:41.22]I'm gonna get stuck.
[01:44.24]The worst part about this game is if you die, you have to start all the way at the beginning and you lose everything you've done.
[01:53.15]So that really is a downer, for sure.
[01:57.51]But you clear all the rooms.
[01:58.89]Once the monsters are all dead, you can keep going.
[02:02.29]And it's pretty difficult later on.
[02:04.33]God, I keep... Almost like I'm stuck here!
[02:07.53]Man, this is not a good start.
[02:08.59]This is not a good start at all.
[02:11.57]Come here.
[02:12.53]Come here, you walking corpse.
[02:15.03]Ooh, a chest.
[02:16.99]I will take you.
[02:19.17]And it's bombs and a heart.
[02:20.45]Okay, there we go.
[02:22.09]That's what I like to see.
[02:22.91]Alright, let's go... No, I want to go down.
[02:27.87]Let's go to the right.
[02:29.79]So I'm going to try and complete as much as I can in one video.
[02:34.12]If I die, I'll probably stop the video.
[02:37.17]So, let's see how far I can get without dying.
[02:38.91]Or how far I can get... Oh, that's the boss room.
[02:41.75]Don't want to go in there.
[02:43.55]Oh, there's an item room right here.
[02:45.75]Ten bombs!
[02:48.01]Oh my god.
[02:49.77]Couldn't I blow something up over here?
[02:52.35]I'm pretty sure I could.
[02:53.67]Wait, wait, wait, what?
[02:55.29]Why do I have a... Oh.
[02:57.06]There's a fuse coming out of my head.
[03:01.34]That's kind of twisted.
[03:03.60]Can I buy?
[03:04.04]Yeah.
[03:04.82]There's nothing I can blow up.
[03:06.62]What can I blow up?
[03:08.60]Wasn't this something?
[03:09.40]Maybe I'm just crazy.
[03:11.58]Like, I am crazy.
[03:13.38]I absolutely am just crazy.
[03:14.78]Let's just get out of here.
[03:17.14]The Binding of Isaac.
[03:19.52]And everything's random, I think.
[03:21.85]Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe everything is random.
[03:25.33]Let's go to the first boss.
[03:27.45]Isaac versus Gemini.
[03:29.93]The twins.
[03:31.11]Oh my god.
[03:31.79]Okay.
[03:32.33]Yep.
[03:32.91]Yep.
[03:33.87]We are... Why is he green?
[03:36.37]What's with the green thing?
[03:37.21]Let's drop some bombs.
[03:39.50]Bomberman style.
[03:40.32]I'm gonna get myself killed.
[03:42.02]I get it.
[03:42.40]I get it.
[03:43.22]So when he takes a breath, I'm gonna drop a bomb right down his throat.
[03:47.76]Here we go.
[03:48.18]Blow up!
[03:50.72]Hell yeah.
[03:51.85]Whoa.
[03:52.25]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:53.49]That's creepy.
[03:55.45]Walk into that.
[03:57.51]This is pretty easy.
[03:59.59]But I'm not going to say that so soon, because obviously... Run into that.
[04:04.35]Obviously the game is going to get harder.
[04:06.57]And there's a lot of dumb ways you can just die in this game.
[04:10.49]Need those hearts.
[04:11.75]What is this?
[04:13.78]Pentagram.
[04:14.66]Damage up.
[04:15.38]Oh god.
[04:16.92]Alright, more damage.
[04:17.78]I got a bunch of bombs.
[04:19.38]Things are looking up.
[04:20.58]Let's go.
[04:22.92]Let's go to the basement too.
[04:25.84]Isaac just wanted to play with his mommy, but his mommy hates him.
[04:29.95]The story is, I guess, pretty morbid.
[04:33.95]Not sure I want to go into the details, because this game is very, very messed up.
[04:37.79]But the story's okay.
[04:41.33]It's very twisted.
[04:42.09]Ooh, I got plenty of bombs.
[04:44.67]Let's go get these chests.
[04:47.59]I got plenty of bombs.
[04:48.87]I'm not worried about losing them.
[04:51.89]What's in this chest?
[04:54.43]Ooh, coins, life, and another bomb.
[04:58.13]What about over here?
[05:01.34]Oh, yeah.
[05:01.72]I only needed one to begin with.
[05:03.35]I'm an idiot.
[05:04.97]Let's go left.
[05:05.87]Why not?
[05:07.95]Oh, and, uh, we gotta get rid of the, uh, the chocolate sundae.
[05:11.17]That's a chocolate sundae.
[05:12.44]Don't be, like, fooled.
[05:13.36]That's a chocolate sundae.
[05:15.16]Oh, I don't have a key.
[05:17.40]Oh, damn it.
[05:18.56]Oh, you used... Okay, I get it.
[05:20.29]Shit.
[05:22.41]You have to use the keys to open the chests.
[05:26.03]That was a mistake.
[05:27.63]Probably could have saved that for the golden chest.
[05:30.63]Speaking of bombs, let's drop one right there.
[05:33.19]And right... This damage up thing is awesome.
[05:36.49]You kill these things in two shots.
[05:37.75]That's awesome.
[05:40.62]Alright, watch out for the stakes.
[05:42.36]Watch out for the steak and cheese subs.
[05:45.58]Oh boy.
[05:45.90]Need a coin.
[05:50.49]Oh, the cauliflower of death.
[05:52.73]He's gonna blow up by his own.
[05:53.68]There we go.
[05:56.30]Okay.
[05:57.94]Nothing over there.
[06:00.72]Nothing.
[06:01.12]Now, if I'm missing, like, secrets in this game, just make sure to scream in the comment section.
[06:06.09]Because, damn it, no.
[06:08.47]Because I want to make sure I'm getting my money's worth.
[06:12.65]Speaking of money, this game is only $5.
[06:15.87]So, if you like what you see, and you want to try it out yourself...
[06:19.26]It's only five bucks on Steam.
[06:21.32]So... Oh, yeah, I'm blowing it up.
[06:23.86]I'm gonna go get the chest.
[06:26.84]What is that?
[06:27.54]What's down there?
[06:30.13]I... What is this?
[06:31.91]Can I get in there?
[06:32.99]Can I blow it up?
[06:36.03]Um... I don't want to go in that door, because I want to use the key on the chest that's over here.
[06:42.97]Let's just go.
[06:46.04]Two hearts...
[06:47.44]Thank you very much.
[06:48.54]Full health.
[06:51.46]Oh, okay.
[06:52.68]Here's a conundrum.
[06:54.08]Do I open the chest or do I open the door?
[06:57.44]I'm opening the door.
[06:58.22]It's guaranteed to be an item.
[07:00.14]What is this?
[07:01.64]Faith up.
[07:02.60]Whoa!
[07:03.30]Whoa, I just got three extra hearts.
[07:06.36]Holy crap.
[07:08.60]Can I fill my... Oh, it's just... I think they're temporarily there.
[07:13.52]Yeah, they're temporarily there.
[07:14.66]Let's go to the boss.
[07:15.34]Alright, I'm all beefed up.
[07:18.33]Isaac versus Mastro.
[07:20.71]Monstro.
[07:23.39]Oh, he jumps around.
[07:24.23]Okay, this seems pretty simple.
[07:28.35]Okay, that's fine with me.
[07:30.03]Go ahead, keep puking.
[07:32.22]Oh boy.
[07:33.82]Walk into that bomb.
[07:36.26]Boom.
[07:37.02]Nice.
[07:40.48]This game is disgusting.
[07:44.38]Like, look at all the gross stuff all over the place.
[07:47.77]If you're not for the faint of heart, I apologize.
[07:50.13]This game is pretty insane.
[07:53.33]Let's just say, okay, this is grapefruit juice.
[07:56.27]And the stuff on the sides is chocolate.
[08:00.15]And this guy is just a big jelly bean.
[08:03.13]No, no, what is he?
[08:03.69]He's a certain snack, a certain candy he is.
[08:07.61]Jujubee.
[08:08.13]He's a Jujubee.
[08:09.31]So don't be alarmed kids.
[08:10.79]It's okay.
[08:11.23]It's just ketchup, grapefruit juice, Jujubees, and chocolate syrup.
[08:15.53]So don't worry.
[08:16.17]It's... I'm almost at the third level.
[08:20.66]Die!
[08:22.84]Will you just die?
[08:23.68]A radioactive spider has appeared in the basement?
[08:28.56]What the hell does that mean?
