[00:05.35]Hello dissenters, my name is Etalyx and I am here today with my friends Jerma and MLC_St3alth.
[00:12.69]And we are going to do another fail build.
[00:15.01]This time we are going to be constructing a praying mantis.
[00:18.96]And here we have the hiding cactus.
[00:23.58]Shh, nobody can see me.
[00:27.80]Okay, and of course Deadpool.
[00:30.20]Yeah, hey.
[00:33.26]Alright, and...
[00:35.43]In.
[00:35.59]Wait, what are we building again?
[00:37.45]Hold on.
[00:38.77]A praying mantis.
[00:39.71]We went over this.
[00:40.51]I forgot.
[00:41.55]Alright, praying mantis in three, two, one, go.
[00:45.50]Alright.
[00:47.24]Where's the front and where's the back?
[00:48.68]I didn't even know what a praying mantis looks like.
[00:51.14]Alright, start with the legs.
[00:52.32]There's like four spindly little legs.
[00:54.50]Alright, so he's got four.
[00:56.79]No, he only has two legs, doesn't he?
[00:58.21]You guys just get started.
[00:59.25]I'm googling praying mantis.
[01:00.11]I think he's got four.
[01:02.21]No, I think a praying mantis has... I don't know.
[01:05.31]No, he has two.
[01:06.35]He crawls on his hands and knees, doesn't he?
[01:09.38]Why didn't we look up what a praying mantis looks like?
[01:12.68]I'm pretty sure he's only got... I think he's got four legs.
[01:14.72]Wait, I don't have the dark green wool.
[01:15.92]He has four legs.
[01:17.60]That's Google Images here.
[01:19.74]He has four legs?
[01:20.82]Where are they?
[01:22.08]Oh my god, what are you doing?
[01:23.54]I'm building a big spindly leg.
[01:26.12]We think we're on the same color.
[01:28.75]Well, we're using dark green, or whatever the darker one is.
[01:31.45]Alright, like, why can't I put a block down here?
[01:34.53]See, here's his legs, right?
[01:36.19]So that's, okay.
[01:37.89]And then his body's gonna come out this way.
[01:40.25]Okay, or delete all of my blocks if you want to.
[01:46.99]Wait, how do you place a block?
[01:48.33]Oh, right click.
[01:49.01]Okay.
[01:50.71]How do you place a block?
[01:52.85]I was left clicking.
[01:53.53]I was like, why is it destroying everything?
[01:55.03]Are his four legs back?
[01:57.77]I gotta look up what he looks like.
[02:01.23]No, he's got a really long body.
[02:03.47]Yeah, he's got like two in the front and then two on the side, like right next to him.
[02:08.07]And then a really long body in the back with wings on top.
[02:11.76]We gotta make this kind of circular.
[02:17.91]Like a little sphere body.
[02:19.69]You know what I'm saying?
[02:21.53]See, like, three blocks wide all the way back?
[02:23.41]Or four?
[02:24.05]Four blocks.
[02:25.49]Alright, so... So, don't make it any wider than this.
[02:28.12]And just make his body, like, come out to touch the blocks.
[02:30.28]You know what I'm saying?
[02:30.82]Alright, good thing we're making, like, a goose grasshopper.
[02:33.48]This is perfect.
[02:34.28]Yeah, currently we're making, uh...
[02:36.74]I don't know what this is.
[02:37.82]It looks like some kind of jungle gem is what it looks like.
[02:41.66]I don't know.
[02:43.48]Let's make the slide.
[02:45.31]Oh, look, we're making another horse.
[02:49.17]Green horse.
[02:50.17]Hey, his body's going to be so much longer than this, like way longer.
[02:54.61]Yeah, it's got to go out past the legs.
[02:56.85]It's got to go out past the legs.
[02:57.71]I was feeling like his chest.
[02:59.26]Alright, I'll start building his neck, I guess.
[03:02.40]I don't know.
[03:02.76]Wait, I thought that's what I was doing just now.
[03:04.92]Wait, oh, is that the front or is this the front?
[03:09.10]He's not like a giraffe.
[03:10.28]He has to come out long like this.
[03:13.72]Yeah, the neck goes out pretty far and then he's got his scissor hands.
[03:18.45]Shouldn't he be looking up right now with that?
[03:20.13]Yeah, go up.
[03:20.59]Start going up.
[03:22.59]Yeah, why is he going so far like left like what is the drama?
[03:26.09]What is this dude?
[03:27.41]He's like look at his stuff Like he go he looks up cuz he kind of like looks up.
[03:33.24]I will then start going up right now from here I'm building
[03:38.01]Because his legs start where he starts going up.
[03:43.47]Hold on.
[03:44.17]We gotta redo the leg stuff.
[03:45.51]Just keep doing what you're doing.
[03:47.69]Alright, I'm working on the tail or something back here.
[03:49.87]I don't really know.

[04:08.71]I don't know.
[04:09.19]I don't know.
[04:09.59]I'm not convinced yet.
[04:10.43]I'm not convinced.
[04:11.57]Wait, what's going on with his leg?
[04:13.45]This is his leg.

[04:31.89]Oh, my.
[04:32.17]What happened?
[04:33.97]What have you done to Gumby?
[04:36.85]It looks like somebody put Gumby on the torture rack and stretched him out.
[04:41.33]What have you done to Gumby?
[04:42.71]It looks like some sort of dinosaur.
[04:46.83]Oh, good thing we brought Gumby to the medieval times and put him on the stretcher.
[04:52.43]The breastplate stretcher.
[04:53.45]Alright, I'm making some wings.
[04:54.91]Alright, time to make his arms.
[04:58.57]Alright, I'm going to work on his head.
[05:03.72]Four minutes and twenty seconds have gone by.
[05:06.04]If I cover up his body with the wings... Wait, this thing has wings?
[05:12.81]Yeah, dude.
[05:15.51]Praying mantises have wings.
[05:20.61]Didn't you know?
[05:22.96]We're making like a centaur!
[05:24.58]This is not a praying mantis, this is a centaur.
[05:30.89]Okay, look, if you look at it from right here, if you look at it from right here, come where I am.
[05:36.57]Come over here to where I am.
[05:37.77]He's got the same arms as the dude behind him.
[05:40.07]Look, come over here where I am, right here behind you guys.
[05:42.10]Alright, how are we doing this?
[05:44.10]It looks like Alien, okay?
[05:46.38]It looks like Alien from the movie Alien, except he's green.
[05:49.70]Well, I guess Preyman just kind of looks like an alien, doesn't he?
[05:53.16]No, like THE alien.
[05:55.50]Oh.
[05:56.92]Like, with the big head.
[06:00.32]God, this is so awful.
[06:01.42]Five minutes have gone by.
[06:02.36]Whoops.
[06:04.54]Alright, I got, I got, I'm getting pretty good on the wings right here.
[06:10.40]We're doing pretty good.
[06:11.12]Alright, there's his head.
[06:12.75]Oh my god.
[06:14.37]Yeah, hi, I pray it matches.
[06:17.79]Are you guys making Squidward over there?
[06:19.47]What's going on here?
[06:21.05]Yes.
[06:23.31]He looks like... Oh my god.
[06:28.16]This is the worst Pregnant.
[06:32.48]You have to look at it where it blocks out the rest of his body and it just looks hilarious.
[06:36.54]Come back here.
[06:37.56]Come over here where I am.
[06:39.44]Where it blocks out the back of his body.
[06:42.31]You can't even tell.
[06:43.11]It looks like a stick figure.
[06:44.17]Like a green alien.
[06:46.99]He really does just look like an alien.
[06:48.35]He looks like the South Park alien.
[06:52.17]His body needs to be not a complete atrocity.
[06:57.64]This needs to be a little bit bigger.
[06:59.64]Or wider.
[07:00.14]A little more thick.
[07:03.70]Alright, six minutes have gone by.
[07:05.85]Six minutes?
[07:07.05]Good grief, man.
[07:09.05]Alright, whatever.
[07:10.29]I made some wings, so that's cool.
[07:13.37]I think...
[07:15.60]Oh, we've got a random... Oh, no!
[07:19.94]He's got the tiniest little legs.
[07:24.46]He's got to have these hands have to be like knives.
[07:27.87]Yeah, make them knives.
[07:30.21]My Minecraft is so bad at
[07:33.95]Alright, now he has like machine guns apparently.
[07:36.57]What's the different colors?
[07:38.63]You said he had to have knives, so I made like... I made knives.
[07:42.98]Yeah.
[07:43.68]Oh, let's give this other one a knife too.
[07:45.64]I was just making him break.
[07:46.50]Oh yeah.
[07:47.44]Don't mess with him, he's got like two Tommy guns.
[07:50.38]Oh, okay.
[07:51.74]Good idea.
[07:52.06]Good, good, good, good, good.
[07:53.66]Alright.
[07:54.64]Yeah, he's just got like... One hand, something happened when he was born.
[08:02.20]I'm not really sure.
[08:02.88]You're blessed in one minute.
[08:04.94]Look at his freaking head.
[08:06.10]It really just looks like an alien.
[08:08.96]Somebody... Alright, wait 30 seconds.
[08:13.91]30 seconds.
[08:15.71]He can fly more with these wings.
[08:16.89]Hold on, let's make him a bit bigger.
[08:21.43]Okay, here we go.
[08:22.27]His legs are a little bit more thick now.
[08:25.38]He's so- why is- Alright, you guys, uh, kinda- okay.
[08:29.58]He's a little lopsided.
[08:30.82]Fifteen seconds.
[08:32.78]And one hand is, like, extremely larger and thicker than the other, but- Ten seconds.
[08:38.74]It looks like we combined two different things in the middle.
[08:41.17]Like, it doesn't even look like they're connected.
[08:43.13]Three seconds, two, one, and that's it.
[08:47.51]I put a torch on his face to make it look like he was smoking something.
[08:50.87]I don't know why.
[08:53.75]A good thing we combined, like, two things in the middle.
[08:55.75]Lookit, we made, like, an airplane, and then we combined it with this, like, thing right here, and then an alien.
[09:01.12]Somebody totally deleted my wings.
[09:03.66]I hold you accountable for that.
[09:04.92]I added more wings, is what I did.
[09:06.52]Alright, can somebody come explain to me what's going on over here?
[09:10.77]What is going on?
[09:11.55]Why does he have, like, one hand that's... This is most certainly not a praying mantis.
[09:16.30]I think... One hand has a darker colored knife.
[09:20.70]It has seen more battle than the other, apparently.
[09:24.64]Like, this is like... Oh, my God.
[09:28.05]Come look at it from far away.
[09:29.25]It is so bad from far away.
[09:30.89]Like, up close, it's not that bad.
[09:33.97]This is not a praying mantis.
[09:35.82]It's like a dragon who just didn't make it, like, just, like, I don't know.
[09:39.48]Dude, his wings are, like, on his butt.
[09:45.06]Oh, man.
[09:46.30]Yeah, we didn't, like, do enough.
[09:47.50]Like, this is, like, too long, or we didn't, like, fill it in enough, like, right here.
[09:50.49]Because it's just, like, a lot of nothing.
[09:54.87]Oh, my God.
[09:55.45]Alright, well, thanks for watching, guys.
[09:58.85]And we'll catch you guys all next time.
[10:00.99]And, of course, rate the thing and give it a name if you want to give it a name.
[10:05.76]And we'll see you all next time.
[10:06.72]Take care, everybody.
[10:08.68]Boo.
[10:10.76]Boo.
[10:10.86]Oh, downstairs.
[10:19.16]What?
