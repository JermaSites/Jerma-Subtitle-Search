[00:39.69]Soft, too.
[00:43.17]Uh... Hi, guys.
[00:46.67]Hey, you know when you take a dog out to walk?
[00:51.02]And... They just walk around in circles, and they pee.
[00:54.68]And they do the thing, but they do the... I'm turning around, I'm turning around.
[00:57.66]I'm turning around, I'm turning around.
[00:58.80]Here we go, here comes the shit.
[00:59.76]I'm turning around, I'm spinning around in circles.
[01:01.62]And... What's that smell over there?
[01:03.22]Something smells over there.
[01:05.16]He did that, like, five times.
[01:06.70]New gorillas tracks are out!
[01:08.84]New Gorillaz tracks are out.
[01:10.68]Red fucking alert.
[01:11.90]Are you serious?
[01:14.64]Hold on a second.
[01:16.36]Did somebody just say that the Gorillaz tracks have launched?
[01:19.12]Are they singles?
[01:21.68]Are you kidding me?
[01:25.15]Ladies and gentlemen, we got a red alert here.
[01:28.75]We got a red alert here.
[01:30.33]Gorillaz tracks have launched.
[01:35.99]They're kind of out?
[01:36.77]What does that mean?
[01:45.67]Oh, they're not out yet.
[01:47.59]Oh, well.
[01:49.21]Well, we've got a red alert here.
[01:51.81]Ladies and gentlemen, red alert.
[01:52.71]The girls have launched their new album.
[01:58.70]Okay, I'm done with that.
[01:59.48]I won't do that anymore.
[02:00.26]I promise.
[02:07.13]Well, if that's the case, I'm going to have to check that out.
[02:11.36]Stream's over.
[02:12.04]I'm going to watch the new Gorillaz album.
[02:15.29]I've been waiting for that shit for years, man.
[02:19.43]I've been waiting for that for like five years since Plastic Beach.
[02:23.87]The new album comes out the 28th.
[02:25.96]Ooh.
[02:29.04]Interesting.
[02:31.04]Everyone's saying listen now.
[02:32.16]No, I can't listen to it now.
[02:33.44]Nope.
[02:34.30]I have to just lock myself in my room and just put headphones in and just melt into my bed and listen.
[02:41.42]I don't want my first experience to be on stream.
[02:43.30]I want that to be like melting in my bed like a chocolate bar.
[02:48.22]But tonight we're going to play Hollow Knight.
[02:50.74]I can actually just switch over to it right now.
[02:53.06]I'm ready to go.
[02:55.21]There it is.
[02:57.53]Hey.
[02:59.53]Yeah.
[03:00.35]I'm enjoying this game a lot so I don't know why I wouldn't continue to play it.
[03:05.83]Did I like Plastic Beach?
[03:06.85]I love Plastic Beach.
[03:10.07]Plastic Beach is, I think, their best album.
[03:14.89]I know Demon Days, I've said like, you know, I've gone back and forth.
[03:18.73]I think Demon Days is probably the best album.
[03:23.54]But I think Plastic Beach, it just, I like all the songs more.
[03:29.06]I like the whole album of Plastic Beach.
[03:31.47]Demon Days has much better singles, I think.
[03:34.57]But Plastic Beach as a whole album, I think, is better than Demon Days.
[03:39.61]Sorry, that might make somebody angry.
[03:44.26]But, yeah, we're gonna play Hollow Knight.
[03:49.38]And let's move this out of the way.
[03:52.56]You know, it's been, like, it's been, like, a while.
[03:56.87]It's been, like, a good, like, what, like, four or five days?
[03:58.85]What?
[04:01.95]So I'm trying to remember like what I was doing and where I was going, but I'm sure you guys will be able to help me Hey sticks renegade Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[04:13.38]You missed that one try another the new sub sound There's phase three of like the channel like a read work is on the way Like we're doing more things
[04:26.99]You know, okay, I'm gonna... When you buy a house... You know, like, you fix the bathroom up... And then you realize that, like, the door to the bathroom... I don't like this door to the bathroom.
[04:36.44]I'm gonna replace it.
[04:38.02]And you replace the door to the bathroom.
[04:39.74]And then you realize that, like, the toilet in the bathroom... Like, you're like, I don't like the toilet either.
[04:43.69]I wanna replace the toilet.
[04:45.33]And then you wanna paint the bathroom.
[04:47.65]That's what's happening.
[04:50.97]Alright, um... Where was I going?
[04:53.59]Um...
[04:55.68]There was a couple places to go.
[04:57.18]I believe the Crystal place, Crystal Peak, right?
[05:00.68]I think that's the next spot for me, is Crystal Peak.
[05:04.80]Wait, what?
[05:07.88]Jervis Phase 3 album.
[05:10.68]So wait, before I start, the Gorillaz songs, are any of them actual singles from the album?
[05:15.88]And, follow up question, don't give me any spoilers, but are the songs any good?
[05:20.34]Are they like, good fucking gorilla songs?
[05:23.00]Are these like, are there some like, hot singles in those four tracks that they released?
[05:29.29]Yeah?
[05:32.37]They're so good, really.
[05:35.37]Ah, fuck it, I can't wait for this shit.
[05:40.44]Very good.
[05:43.77]Yeah.
[05:45.15]They're all in the album one.
[05:46.29]Okay.
[05:49.05]This used to be a game stream.
[05:50.33]Alright, well, let's just go from here.
[05:54.10]I think I was very angry at Kristen.
[05:56.90]I ended the stream angrily last time, didn't I?
[05:59.62]Wait, what?
[06:00.78]Let's go to... Where are we right now?
[06:05.42]Where the hell am I?
[06:05.98]Oh, I'm over here.
[06:07.98]Alright, so if I go left, is that going to help me out there?
[06:10.69]What was in here?
[06:11.49]Wait, what?
[06:14.77]Seems like good singles, but the best songs are usually, uh... Oh, right!
[06:19.01]Okay, I got a new- I got an item that I can't get hit, right?
[06:23.21]That's the last thing that happened.
[06:26.94]So I have to go from here... to the Queen Station without being- getting hit.
[06:33.30]Okay.
[06:34.50]We're gonna give that a try.
[06:36.37]I can't get hit one time.
[06:38.35]But I just gotta make it to the Queen Station.
[06:43.46]Let's make sure I still have that, whatever it is.
[06:45.27]Here it is.
[06:46.71]Delicate flower.
[06:47.47]This flower is very fragile and will be destroyed if you take damage or ride the stagways.
[06:52.15]Okay, so just don't get hit one time.
[06:54.27]Sounds easy enough.
[06:58.93]Alright.
[07:04.26]No.
[07:05.72]So I'm still over here.
[07:06.64]We just gotta go left.
[07:08.62]Hopefully we run into it.
[07:09.52]There we go.
[07:17.38]Okay, haven't been hit yet.
[07:19.82]So far, so good.
[07:24.85]Haven't been hit once.
[07:26.75]Shit's going pretty well, I think.
[07:28.11]Um... Wish I had a map.
[07:44.24]Oh yeah, forgot I have a dash.
[07:46.28]Forgot I got the dash.
[07:49.71]Discuss the gorillas more.
[07:51.67]Well... Um... The gorillas are my favorite band.
[07:59.58]By far.
[08:00.10]Everyone ever asks that question.
[08:01.96]I get that question sometimes.
[08:04.28]And by far... The gorillas are my favorite band, and I'll tell you a couple of reasons why.
[08:11.18]Because the band... It's not... Wait, this just brings me to the way that weird lady was.
[08:17.79]Yeah, this is like the flower lady.
[08:19.67]Can't go anywhere from here.
[08:22.81]I still need hundreds of those things.
[08:24.41]Okay.
[08:27.49]All the Gorillaz albums are compilation albums.
[08:30.16]And they bring on new artists and random people that you may not have ever heard before.
[08:35.48]And it opens your mind and opens your eyes to different people and different artists.
[08:40.82]I like the fact that it's not just Damon Albarn.
[08:43.57]And...
[08:45.99]Oh yeah, Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett made some cartoons.
[08:51.07]No, it's legit.
[08:52.78]It's Damon Albarn gets a bunch of people to do this whole album.
[09:01.60]What was my first exposure to the Gorillaz?
[09:02.94]Well, like everybody, it's Clint Eastwood.
[09:05.52]Clint Eastwood was the first time I ever listened to any Gorillaz at all.
[09:09.80]And I thought it was fantastic.
[09:10.80]Alright, the last thing I did was I killed this guy.
[09:13.62]The war man.
[09:25.90]No, I don't have a map for this area.
[09:27.54]But where am I?
[09:28.22]I'm right there.
[09:30.84]Can't afford this, I don't think.
[09:32.36]This is some kind of pass.
[09:34.82]Oh, shit.
[09:40.31]Ugh.
[09:43.93]I guess I could go, like, left and up.
[09:47.11]Looks like I can go there from here, but I can't... I don't see a way how.
[09:50.08]Maybe I just gotta go down and around.
[09:57.48]Because I can't see a place to go from there.
[10:04.81]Yeah, Clint Eastwood.
[10:06.03]Obviously, all the stuff with Del.
[10:09.23]Del.
[10:10.91]You could argue that Del was one of the reasons why the gorillas took off because of his tracks on the first album.
[10:24.43]Oh shit, that's right.
[10:25.57]I didn't do my Twitter notification.
[10:26.73]I'll do that.
[10:30.37]I didn't rewrite it.
[10:30.97]I didn't write it on Twitter.
[10:33.71]Let me write that on Twitter right now because I forgot.
[10:45.78]More Hollow Knight.
[10:52.56]Hollow Knight.
[10:56.76]But yeah, I just like the fact that they're cartoons is cool.
[11:01.09]But I don't really follow the lore, I guess, or the story of the cartoon.
[11:07.69]The gorillas band kind of storyline.
[11:14.53]As much as some people do.
[11:20.37]I find it interesting, but it seems really confusing.
[11:28.16]There's like robot people, there's people that have been like gone for like months or something like that, right?
[11:33.56]There's a lot of lore for the gorillas.
[11:42.64]But I will be listening to those tracks for sure when the stream is over.
[11:46.80]Alright, we're good.
[11:51.32]So this takes us... Can I go up?
[11:55.84]I think this just goes down.
[12:03.04]Where am I now?
[12:04.04]Here.
[12:05.34]Aye, aye, aye.
[12:08.04]No, I'm going to go right.
[12:10.32]This used to be a gorillas stream.
[12:17.65]I hate getting lost in games like this.
[12:19.29]There's like one specific place that I want to go.
[12:21.15]I might just have to take like a stag.
[12:29.74]Just up to here.
[12:30.52]Because there's no way I'm going to be able to find this shit.
[12:37.62]Now we're over here.
[12:38.72]Queen's Garden.
[12:40.89]I guess I haven't, like, been there yet.
[12:42.09]This is where I was before.
[12:49.20]Uh... Here's the one problem with playing this game.
[12:57.96]Is stuff like this.
[12:59.66]The last time I played this game was, like, four or five days ago.
[13:03.36]And I'm just like, wait, what happened?
[13:04.70]There's, like, a giant fucking map and there's a ton of things.
[13:07.23]Where am I?
[13:10.26]I don't think I'm supposed to be over here, though.
[13:12.32]Or maybe I am.
[13:14.24]I don't think so, though.
[13:17.88]This is where all the secrets were.
[13:19.15]Oh, God.
[13:21.41]Yeah, there's this thing.
[13:25.41]This doesn't do anything for me.
[13:29.33]Well, the flower's destroyed.
[13:31.09]And I'm gonna die.
[13:31.73]Because I'm stuck in the wall.
[13:35.97]Well, that was great.
[13:36.73]That was fun.
[13:38.33]I'd love to just go to the place that I want to go.
[13:41.45]Instead of just getting lost over here in fucking no man's land.
[13:46.17]Can I, like, what the fuck?
[13:48.71]I just want to go over here.
[13:51.99]You're telling me I gotta, like, fucking, ugh.
[13:53.48]A lot of pain in the ass.
[13:57.20]Come on now.
[14:04.40]Ugh.
[14:08.98]You tell me I have to go down.
[14:10.90]Down that stupid elevator again.
[14:12.52]Take the stag up to fucking here and walk to the right.
[14:14.90]I just have no, I just, there's no way for me to know where I am.
[14:30.46]Like, I just have to go down there.
[14:31.48]I just have to go to the King Station.
[14:34.69]That might not be the best possible route, but I'm not going to sit here and just stare at a fucking map all day.
[14:39.51]And I'm already fucking angry because I don't want to be doing this right now.
[14:42.63]I want to play the game.
[14:44.43]I want to play Hollow Knight.
[14:47.78]I want to play Hollow Knight, not walk around and backtrack on a map and not know where the fuck I am.
[14:57.18]That's what we have to do, apparently.
[15:07.02]I'm just going to go down.
[15:13.97]Just take the stag station.
[15:15.35]What are you guys... I'm going down there right now.
[15:17.39]I don't know where the stag station is.
[15:20.78]I can't see it on the map.
[15:24.18]I didn't know that there's a stag station underneath the weird lady because it doesn't exist because I didn't see it.
[15:28.34]I'm just going to go down.
[15:42.89]Stag also destroys the flower?
[15:44.89]Oh well.
[15:50.96]I'm just gonna go take this one.
[15:58.28]No, go down!
[15:59.45]Oh, I'm getting fucking angry now!
[16:01.15]Like, go down!
[16:02.61]I'll just go down myself!
[16:04.03]Fuck it, what do I even need to do that for?
[16:16.33]I don't really care about that $300.
[16:19.13]I'm so done with this shit.
[16:20.53]I just want to play.
[16:21.29]I just want to progress in the game.
[16:23.65]I just want to progress in the game.
[16:25.01]Oh my god, this is so irritating to me.
[16:34.42]Shit like this really bothers me.
[16:37.72]It's top right.
[16:49.20]He ain't happy, he's feeling mad.
[16:51.95]Already mad.
[16:52.57]No, I'm mad at this dumb shit.
[16:55.05]I hate this.
[16:57.91]I don't mind backtracking, but when I can't see where the fuck I'm going up here, it's like, come on.
[17:03.57]Why do I have to go buy a map every time?
[17:05.65]Like, fuck you, game.
[17:11.36]Where am I going?
[17:13.28]Before I get too angry to play this game.
[17:18.66]Um... I guess we're just going to Dirtmouth?
[17:22.75]I guess.
[17:28.39]Yeah, let me like just... What if I happen to like Fog of War?
[17:50.24]It's taking me like 20 fucking 2 minutes.
[17:53.60]To even remotely get to a place where I need to be.
[17:59.84]Can I even do anything over here?
[18:00.90]What is this?
[18:01.30]Who the hell are you?
[18:02.28]Anything else?
[18:14.13]Well, I just killed that guy.
[18:19.96]Stone door with a simple lock.
[18:21.92]Okay, well, that simple key is... I don't have a simple key.
[18:25.62]I used it to go, like, down that weird sewer.
[18:36.08]You have anything for me?
[18:36.98]You're empty.
[18:37.78]No?
[18:38.00]Okay, you aren't empty.
[18:41.58]Where the hell is this stuff?
[18:46.35]Uh, warrior pins?
[18:48.19]Resting ground.
[18:48.87]So many guys don't have any money.
[18:55.45]Oh, fuck it.
[18:57.95]I'm just gonna go where I'm going.
[19:00.29]And whatever.
[19:00.79]We'll just go from here.
[19:04.72]I need to just get to a position where I can play the game.
[19:07.62]Regardless of any special shit that I should be doing or special things I should be buying.
[19:12.08]Just get me to the position where I can play.
[19:17.98]Instead of walking around in circles for an hour.
[19:26.78]This way.
[19:36.63]Just got here.
[19:37.07]What's with the numbers?
[19:38.63]What do you mean, numbers?
[19:40.95]Which numbers?
[19:42.33]What numbers do you speak of?
[19:47.13]Okay, we're getting dangerously close to it.
[19:49.07]Nope, down one more.
[19:53.77]But anyways, thank you to FatBoss.
[19:57.61]Thanks for the five bucks.
[19:58.31]He says, I have no idea if you can see this message, Jerma.
[20:00.19]No idea what bits are.
[20:01.29]Rarely use Twitch or watch any streams, but I am a new subscriber to you since only you are truly worth my time.
[20:07.15]Entertaining, original, awesome, and you deserve my not hard-earned five dollars.
[20:10.64]Thanks.
[20:10.96]All the years are great videos.
[20:12.86]Well, thank you, FatBoss.
[20:14.72]Or FatBossSiant.
[20:19.01]I'm glad that you are enjoying yourself.
[20:24.93]Much love to you.
[20:26.73]So let's just go this way.
[20:29.67]Through the mines.
[20:35.24]Wait, why are we just writing numbers?
[20:39.44]We're just writing down like numbers right now?
[20:45.28]Crystal peaks.
[20:46.10]Okay.
[20:48.42]So we're gonna go... Up.
[20:51.56]Down, right, up.
[20:54.04]Hey, we made it to where we wanted to go.
[20:58.68]Whoops.
[21:00.43]Where does this take me?
[21:02.03]Back to the fucker.
[21:02.61]I didn't crossroads.
[21:05.75]This is just dark.
[21:06.51]We'll do that later, maybe.
[21:16.68]Yeah.
[21:18.48]Keep going this way.
[21:20.78]Eventually we wrap ourselves around.
[21:22.59]We can go up.
[21:24.39]Yes.
[21:25.19]Up and to the right.
[21:27.23]Yes.
[21:32.43]I didn't mean for this to happen.
[21:33.49]Please don't ban me.
[21:35.72]What?
[21:35.86]Because you wrote like a number in the chat?
[21:37.48]No one's going to ban you for that.
[21:39.66]Yeah.
[21:45.90]Think I can get up there right now.
[21:46.78]Nope.
[21:50.46]I'll have to go this way.
[22:01.27]Straight up and then to the right.
[22:08.95]Permaband.
[22:11.67]Should I go this way?
[22:12.89]I'm close enough to this one.
[22:18.11]Can I get up there?
[22:25.85]At least I'm making money.
[22:33.54]Thank God, no one's gonna know that I was the one that should have been banned.
[22:42.17]What are you guys talking about?
[22:44.83]I was the one that needed to be banned.
[22:46.75]It was me.
[22:49.49]Hey, Sam.
[22:49.95]Thanks for the bits.
[22:50.51]Thanks for three bucks, Sam.
[22:51.99]I finally got a good bit of bits.
[22:54.11]Huzzah.
[22:58.25]Can I even go all the way over here?
[23:03.43]You got some bits?
[23:09.90]Oops.
[23:11.50]Oof.
[23:14.24]Almost there.
[23:17.28]See, I tried to do this before and I fell all the way down.
[23:19.56]So I'm not going to do that again.
[23:20.72]We're going to go back.
[23:28.08]We're going back.
[23:28.74]Just wanted to make sure that that was not something I needed to do.
[23:35.39]It wasn't.
[23:42.83]I want to go left and up.
[23:44.41]I just got to keep progressing up that way.
[23:51.58]Try doing it again.
[23:52.26]I'm not going to try doing that again until I exhaust all my options over here.
[24:01.30]I just got back up.
[24:02.06]Am I still doing the flower thing?
[24:03.44]No.
[24:05.12]I got locked in the wall and died from those bug beetle things.
[24:12.20]Turn facecam on?
[24:14.16]No, I don't wanna.
[24:16.56]Ow!
[24:19.26]No, no facecam.
[24:21.28]I'm just trying to fix my sleep schedule, and I look like a tired shithead.
[24:24.98]And I don't think I'm even supposed to be going this way.
[24:32.01]I don't think I'm supposed to be going this way.
[24:33.23]Although, I've been wrong, so let's just see what happens.
[24:35.59]Yeah, this is where the bug... Yeah, okay, I'm supposed to go this way.
[24:40.99]Sorry for starting the gorilla conversation.
[24:44.19]The gorilla conversation, that's... I'll have that conversation.
[24:49.12]I fucking love that band.
[25:00.67]I guess I can just go right.
[25:01.57]Let's try that.
[25:02.71]Do that first.
[25:14.23]No, keep going right.
[25:19.19]I never got my souls back.
[25:20.23]No, I didn't.
[25:21.28]I was so angry at the fact that I was just lost backtracking that I don't even care.
[25:26.84]I would rather spend $300 than have to go back there without a map and do that all over again.
[25:30.52]Okay, so I can't go there yet.
[25:34.78]But I can go up.
[25:44.23]There's the bench.
[25:47.09]Do that.
[25:47.43]Let's have an auto conversation.
[25:56.25]Well, I love my dog.
[25:57.19]We can have an auto conversation any day of the week.
[26:05.24]Keep going up.
[26:08.48]Can't keep going up.
[26:10.76]Interesting.
[26:12.10]Well, shit.
[26:13.88]Looks like we have to go this way and up.
[26:19.58]Do I ever have the problem where I get too comfortable and I oversleep because of it?
[26:24.17]Yeah, I mean, I just have sleep issues anyways.
[26:27.43]My sleep is always just so fucked up.
[26:29.19]Always.
[26:30.77]It doesn't matter.
[26:31.31]I definitely have some disease or something that makes me have to sleep.
[26:36.55]And have erratic sleep.
[26:38.81]Who knows?
[26:40.67]I'm not a doctor.
[26:41.29]I'm not going to pretend I know at this point.
[26:42.57]Alright, here we are.
[26:48.87]Uncharted territory.
[26:51.85]Hope we're in the right spot.
[26:56.79]Quite a view, though.
[26:57.55]I'm not surprised you survived the trek through these shivering caverns.
[26:59.99]There's an air of strength about you, as expected.
[27:02.01]It would be quite intimidating if not for your small stature.
[27:04.95]Huh.
[27:05.67]Yes.
[27:06.48]Oh, it's saddening to see those miners below still laboring at their endless task.
[27:10.82]They've never overcome a strong purpose, but imprinted upon their lurks.
[27:14.24]Yeah.
[27:14.92]Yeah.
[27:15.70]Yeah.
[27:16.76]Strange to know such ancient facts.
[27:18.14]I wonder from where my knowledge comes.
[27:21.70]That's the fucking last boss.
[27:22.54]I get it.
[27:22.92]Yeah, you're showing me the last boss of the game over and over again.
[27:26.90]It's gonna be me.
[27:47.83]You know what I mean?
[27:48.49]He's going to take off the mask and it's going to be me.
[27:49.97]And it's going to be like, yes, I was you all the time.
[27:52.27]And you're going to be like, well, stop that voice right now.
[27:55.55]No, I'm doing it for every character now for the rest of the time we play.
[28:02.34]Flanker.
[28:03.76]I was actually trying to do like a William Shatner.
[28:18.09]It went from me not caring to William Shatner.
[28:22.86]Back to not caring halfway through.
[28:24.22]Oh, you shithead.
[28:29.92]What?
[28:32.06]Oh, he explodes.
[28:41.23]Present!
[28:42.21]Rancid egg.
[28:43.41]I still don't know what they're supposed to do with these.
[28:48.84]But I guess that was worth doing because it gave me some money.
[28:53.12]Anything else?
[28:54.79]Nothing else I can do in this run?
[28:56.51]In this run?
[28:57.37]And just win?
[29:00.49]Nothing else I can do in this run?
[29:04.65]Well, there is that.
[29:05.25]Ow.
[29:05.31]I thought I was in a safe spot.
[29:10.49]Oh, shit.
[29:15.99]I can't get up there.
[29:16.83]I can.
[29:17.15]I've got to be patient.
[29:24.32]And by patient, just go, you know what I mean?
[29:26.58]Wanderer's journal.
[29:28.58]Anything else over here?
[29:29.34]Nope.
[29:34.28]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:37.22]Anything else?
[29:37.80]This is going to bring me down to here, which will open up these doors.
[29:41.00]Nice.
[29:41.38]Okay.
[29:45.85]Which allows me to go this way, but do I want to go this way?
[29:51.67]I don't know.
[29:53.85]How come I didn't bounce?
[29:59.78]Make things back to here.
[30:01.04]Is there another door, another gate for me to open right here?
[30:06.90]I don't know what that was.
[30:07.96]Maybe not.
[30:11.19]Oh well.
[30:14.65]I'm scared to go down here because maybe I won't be able to get back up.
[30:18.07]I'm afraid of that.
[30:21.80]So we're just gonna go up.
[30:23.96]I opened this one though, so that's okay.
[30:26.46]Worst comes to worst, I can always come back up that way.
[30:38.67]Hmm.
[30:44.28]Can't go that way.
[30:48.36]Well, shit!
[30:55.21]Leads me back to here.
[30:56.06]I guess I'm going to have to go that way.
[31:00.00]Okie dokie.
[31:01.56]Hmm.
[31:16.91]What was that in the chat?
[31:19.31]What the hell was that?
[31:20.55]It was like somebody's eyes on the Jupiter.
[31:26.91]What the fuck was that shit?
[31:31.67]Somebody made like a person's face.
[31:35.09]That was ridiculous.
[31:42.66]Okay, good.
[31:43.32]There we are, yep.
[31:47.30]Oh, sweet!
[31:47.78]I love roguelikes!
[31:49.98]I do too!
[31:51.24]Who doesn't love a good roguelike?
[31:52.42]This room looks suspicious.
[32:03.10]What about up here?
[32:07.07]Kind of, but... No.
[32:10.15]I need this.
[32:10.61]I need the super dash.
[32:17.23]Oh shit.
[32:18.50]Oh shit.
[32:18.92]Let me get a refill.
[32:26.18]Let me get a McDonald's refill.
[32:30.62]Pretty nice roguelike you got there.
[32:32.00]Yeah, thanks.
[32:33.62]It's not mine.
[32:36.27]I currently have an end user license agreement with this game.
[32:39.29]This is not my game.
[32:40.23]Ah, fuck.
[32:43.53]You know?
[32:44.53]You know when you guys like buy a game and you bought an end user license agreement.
[32:48.37]End user license.
[32:49.37]Fuck, I thought that was gonna move like Mario.
[32:53.01]No, shut up and fucking play.
[32:58.18]Yeah, you guys think you own your games?
[33:01.48]No, it's just an end user license.
[33:04.58]Mm-mm.
[33:10.40]I hope there's another bench over here, because this is going to be a real pain in the ass if I can't... Oh dear.
[33:19.56]Oh dear.
[33:22.31]Oh dear.
[33:24.39]Oh dear.
[33:27.37]Bowser's going to be at the end of this.
[33:30.43]I've played this game before.
[33:37.19]What happened?
[33:39.45]You consumed the crystal heart.
[33:44.09]While on the ground or clinging to a wall, the concentrated force releases the button to blast forwards and fly through the air.
[33:48.70]Oh, God.
[33:53.26]Even more of this shit?
[33:57.02]Oh!
[33:59.64]So this is just a super dash.
[34:01.98]Can I jump?
[34:03.93]No.
[34:04.53]It's just a super dash.
[34:05.75]Okay.
[34:12.46]I just did it again So it's just a big dash I only know where I can use that right here So many places to use this there's so many places today I can use this Wait what?
[34:39.93]I'm confused.
[34:40.61]Why did that happen?
[34:42.65]Like, I can't die here.
[34:43.62]I'm just learning this new ability.
[34:47.50]It just goes forever.
[34:48.32]Alright, I guess it just goes forever.
[34:53.16]Interesting.
[34:53.66]Where do I use this shit?
[35:02.07]It's not even... This isn't even a dash.
[35:03.61]This is just fucking flying.
[35:08.09]Okay, there we go.
[35:15.63]Yeah, apparently it just goes forever until you hit a wall.
[35:20.69]And you just cancel it by jumping.
[35:22.07]Now, where can I use this?
[35:23.33]Where was I able to use this?
[35:25.07]I don't know.
[35:33.44]I don't think it was back here.
[35:34.70]There was a place where I could do that.
[35:41.21]Where was that?
[35:41.99]Let me go sit on the bench.
[35:43.07]Just write in my fucking journal about the day.
[35:56.40]I gotta go back to backtrack hell.
[36:01.12]Let's see.
[36:01.78]Is that... um... Down there, right?
[36:16.41]I mean, that looks like I can do it down there.
[36:17.91]Over there to the left?
[36:23.83]I mean, I would assume that looks like a place I can do it.
[36:32.14]This way, right?
[36:36.24]I got to here, and I couldn't go any further.
[36:38.64]Yeah, right here.
[36:42.46]Yeah.
[36:46.34]Oh shit, am I gonna keep going?
[36:47.80]Oh my god, it's just like... It didn't stop, okay.
[36:56.13]What?
[36:57.17]I'm all the way back here again?
[36:58.13]No, we're good.
[37:02.53]Shit.
[37:08.55]I don't like this.
[37:17.71]Where's this going to even lead me?
[37:18.70]Back to Dirt Moth?
[37:23.52]I guess.
[37:24.12]Can I go down?
[37:25.22]Let's go down.
[37:30.42]Apparently.
[37:31.22]Whatever.
[37:31.54]Oh, you double tapped me.
[37:40.91]Good for you.
[37:43.15]You hit me three times.
[37:50.30]One of those.
[37:54.54]Thank you.
[37:57.42]I hear a bunch of those little animals.
[38:00.44]At least one.
[38:03.44]What?
[38:03.60]Somebody ate him!
[38:04.87]What?
[38:05.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[38:05.57]Come here, come here, come here.
[38:07.85]Is he dead?
[38:13.15]Oh, shit.
[38:15.23]I didn't save that one.
[38:16.93]Okay.
[38:19.35]Uh...
[38:24.88]Sorry.
[38:25.30]That's not gonna happen again, is it?
[38:31.88]I guess not.
[38:34.90]Well, at least I saved one.
[38:37.72]Maybe this one can't be saved.
[38:38.78]He's just there for, uh... To teach you that that's possible, maybe.
[38:43.35]I don't know.
[38:46.93]Did I miss anything else?
[38:50.29]No.
[38:57.65]He was just a fake.
[38:58.41]Okay.
[38:59.07]That's fine.
[39:03.73]So this leads back to... We're in Dirtmouth now.
[39:12.99]Uh... Really?
[39:15.49]Damn.
[39:17.53]Oh, shit.
[39:18.39]Okay, well... Where can I use this?
[39:24.28]Dash...
[39:27.95]Okay, it seems like over there in Greenpath, there's a spot.
[39:33.41]To the left.
[39:34.57]I think I couldn't do that before.
[39:36.89]Also, I think there's one down here somewhere, right?
[39:41.55]I think so.
[39:45.16]Let's try this one in Greenpath.
[39:46.78]Let's take the stag to Greenpath and see.
[39:51.28]Over there.
[39:51.86]Well, that's cool that it's a shortcut now.
[40:00.86]Oh, for dare.
[40:02.94]I'm tired.
[40:03.64]I'm sorry, guys.
[40:04.40]What is... Did something open up behind you?
[40:12.42]What is this?
[40:15.52]What is this?
[40:16.06]What's over here?
[40:16.52]What is this?
[40:18.48]Oh, what is that?
[40:19.60]What is that?
[40:22.28]Should you buy this game right now?
[40:23.36]Yes.
[40:24.84]You should.
[40:30.20]I'm gonna go down.
[40:30.68]I'm gonna do the one in Greenpath.
[40:34.16]Just curious if it's even there.
[40:37.24]This one's close enough where I can confirm with myself if it's even a thing.
[41:01.37]Use it to go faster in long straight lines.
[41:03.08]Yeah, that's true.
[41:05.10]See how quickly I can get down here.
[41:13.60]Even if I take hits, whatever.
[41:18.13]You're nearing 60 hours in this game.
[41:20.01]This seems like a lot to do.
[41:23.45]This is a lot to do.
[41:27.21]There is not one question in my mind that this game's worth $15.
[41:31.84]Yeah, so here we go.
[41:37.48]Can't go up, but I can go over.
[41:41.06]Just get this idiot out of the way.
[41:45.62]Here we go.
[41:48.51]Oh, shit.
[41:49.33]Oh, boy.
[41:53.18]I guess I have to just time it?
[41:55.04]Yeah, I just have to time it.
[41:55.86]Hopefully, I'm gonna be in the right spot.
[42:02.95]Oh, shit.
[42:03.65]I gotta go right through the middle.
[42:05.61]Oh, God.
[42:06.31]Oh, no.
[42:13.15]And I gotta make it through here?
[42:14.15]Oh, fuck.
[42:18.36]I was so close.
[42:21.46]Huh?
[42:23.97]What's going on here?
[42:25.79]Um, should I bounce?
[42:27.87]I'm gonna bounce.
[42:29.63]Ah, fuck.
[42:51.46]Oh, fuck.
[42:52.66]Oh, fuck.
[42:53.28]Okay, we're good.
[42:55.08]What's up here?
[42:59.98]What is up here?
[43:05.24]I tracked the whole thing.
[43:06.36]Am I playing Braid right now?
[43:08.86]Only Braid players will get that.
[43:10.63]Come on.
[43:11.19]Stop.
[43:11.61]Fuck.
[43:11.93]Don't.
[43:12.87]Don't make any... What the fuck am I doing?
[43:15.17]I can just go like this.
[43:21.45]Seriously, why did I do that?
[43:23.16]I didn't have to do that.
[43:32.36]What the hell is that for?
[43:39.36]God damn it.
[43:41.26]Alright, we're good.
[43:45.98]I just need to keep going this way.
[43:57.39]Rancid egg.
[43:58.37]I have a lot of these.
[43:59.09]I don't even know what to do with them.
[44:07.75]This shit is so dangerous.
[44:18.20]Thank God.
[44:18.74]Where the hell am I now?
[44:24.41]Somebody else's house.
[44:29.50]Mm, a painter.
[44:33.16]A visitor.
[44:33.86]Oh no, this is the nail master.
[44:36.77]Mm.
[44:38.27]OK.
[44:42.73]So I could probably upgrade my nail.
[44:47.23]Spend my time here secluded trying to master the art of creation.
[44:50.37]Painting, sculpting, these things bring a different kind of pleasure.
[44:52.91]Mmm, you don't seem very moved by what I've said.
[44:55.31]Was it Shale the Nail Master you were looking for?
[44:57.35]Did you come to learn a nail art?
[44:58.61]I'll teach you if you insist.
[45:01.13]Yes.
[45:07.15]Second Nail Master.
[45:11.37]He taught me how to paint.
[45:15.79]Great Slash.
[45:17.69]Hold that to concentrate energy enough into the nail.
[45:22.66]Okay.
[45:29.46]Interesting.
[45:31.50]Let me cut the world.
[45:35.42]Yeah, yeah.
[45:36.05]I have nothing more to teach you.
[45:37.19]You're path forward.
[45:37.87]You only can see good luck.
[45:40.07]So, I have this one.
[45:42.75]Wait a minute.
[45:43.09]What happened to the other one?
[45:46.75]Oh.
[45:55.63]So the difference between these two is just one of them spins.
[46:04.39]Is there actually like a big difference?
[46:07.96]Okay.
[46:16.22]What else do you know?
[46:18.70]So I guess the other nail master is down in like the graveyard.
[46:20.31]Whatever.
[46:20.57]Thanks for the money.
[46:43.24]Well, that's another weapon technique.
[46:45.76]I guess it was worth coming all the way down here for.
[46:48.69]The one issue, though, is we have to go all the way back.
[46:53.43]That's the one problem I have about this, is we have to go back.
[46:56.27]We have to go all the way back.
[47:03.90]That sucks.
[47:04.50]I mean, we have this little shortcut, but, like, fuck that.
[47:24.09]What just happened?
[47:26.39]What just happened?
[47:29.95]I was so silent because I... What the fuck was that?
[47:32.98]What did I touch?
[47:36.30]Am I missing something here?
[47:48.35]I'm getting so like oh god okay everybody calm down alright fuck alright down what about down there down the fog canyon I'm going down to fog we're gonna go down left
[48:15.27]Because that also seems like a big place I couldn't go before, right?
[48:19.71]Whatever it was, it's exploring.
[48:20.83]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:32.77]Am I wasting my time here?
[48:33.67]Or is that another big... Big spot to go down to?
[48:42.32]Frog Canyon.
[48:45.14]I'm gonna make my way over to Frog Canyon.
[48:54.69]This way.
[49:01.25]Let me look at the big map.
[49:04.07]No, I can't.
[49:04.68]Let me look at the big map over here so I don't die.
[49:06.44]Uh...
[49:15.40]Ooh.
[49:18.40]Wait a minute.
[49:20.70]Okay.
[49:21.16]Those are big tubes.
[49:22.50]Down there.
[49:24.36]Okay.
[49:24.72]Ancient Basin.
[49:25.37]I don't have a stag to Ancient Basin, but that was the well.
[49:29.25]Where was that?
[49:30.83]City of Tears?
[49:31.93]I remember it was, like, at the bottom of an elevator.
[49:37.82]Oh.
[49:38.70]Lord.
[49:39.44]Um.
[49:42.90]You know, guys, I've
[49:45.64]I'm pretty lost.
[49:55.90]Have I heard the new Gorill- I have not heard the new Gorillaz tracks, not yet.
[49:59.97]I'm waiting till after stream to listen to them because I want to just chill and be able to take them in without needing to, you know, commentate on them or anything.
[50:08.07]I like to, when I, if I really am into a band, I really want to sit there and take in the songs.
[50:17.17]I don't really want to talk about them, I just kind of want to process them on my own, you know?
[50:21.83]I have not done it yet.
[50:22.55]Shit.
[50:26.89]Alright, I'm just getting lazy now.
[50:31.97]I gotta stop being lazy.
[50:32.87]I need to stop being so lazy.
[50:41.10]I'm being like lazy.
[50:42.02]I'm being like try to go as fast as I can because I'm lazy and I'm sick of doing this Look at me look at me.
[50:49.56]I'm falling apart here This is all gonna be not worth it either that's like the one this is the worst part about this oh
[51:02.11]Alright, somebody just tell me right now.
[51:03.85]Is going all the way down to the lower left here just a stupid idea?
[51:06.61]And is it not going to do anything for me?
[51:09.49]I see the way that that looks.
[51:11.83]Can I actually go over that?
[51:13.97]Or is this just a dumb idea?
[51:14.99]This is just stupid.
[51:28.46]I don't even remember what it is.
[51:29.80]It's a waste of time.
[51:37.82]Alright, well, in that case, if this really is just that there's nothing over there, then I don't want to, like, just go waste time and see nothing, so... Um... Ugh.
[51:49.85]I really wish there was, like, a fast travel or something.
[51:53.13]Just get full health, though.
[51:58.59]I'm gonna go down to the well to where I was going before.
[52:01.43]Snoopin'!
[52:05.23]Snoopin'!
[52:10.66]So, just gonna go back to the stag.
[52:24.82]Left, left, left, left, left.
[52:31.98]More left.
[52:37.90]this is.
[52:39.90]Oh, shit!
[52:42.89]Okay, well, sometimes it's good to be lazy.
[52:48.01]That was so lazy that it... I was so lazy that it gave me something for free.
[52:56.24]No, not again.
[53:07.64]And up again.
[53:12.46]We're going to go to Agent Basin.
[53:17.42]That's where I was progressing before until I could not progress any further.
[53:20.56]So we're just going to go do that.
[53:24.26]Or like random little shit enemies will appear out of the ground and ruin my night.
[53:29.25]That could happen too.
[53:35.58]This game does have fantastic music.
[53:37.00]Who did the music for this game?
[53:41.79]Oh, the gorillas?
[53:49.35]Alright, so how did we get down to where I wanted to go?
[53:56.48]Down here to Ancient Basin.
[54:00.10]Uh, it's right there, right?
[54:03.26]The well.
[54:04.40]City of Tears?
[54:05.90]And then down from City of Tears?
[54:08.50]I believe.
[54:09.54]I think.
[54:15.27]Big map, please.
[54:19.09]City of Tears.
[54:19.55]How come I don't have the City of Tears?
[54:21.73]It says the Sack Station is right there.
[54:23.33]Did I not get it?
[54:27.41]Wait, did I not open up that stag station?
[54:33.09]That's confusing.
[54:35.37]I guess I could go to the cable station.
[54:49.44]Okay, yeah, just go left.
[54:55.58]Is this gonna be Hollow Knight only?
[54:56.88]Yes, it is.
[54:57.34]I'm going to keep slowly progressing in Hollow Knight.
[55:11.85]Alright, keep going left.
[55:13.13]I was curious if that went through shields or not.
[55:28.76]Gorillas appreciation stream.
[55:32.13]They are the greatest.
[55:39.70]I'm just being so lazy.
[55:40.98]Alright, here we are.
[55:45.88]Now it's down, right?
[56:01.95]Mm-hmm.
[56:06.38]And then that shit is down here, right?
[56:13.74]Okay, no, wait.
[56:18.46]Am I going the right way right now?
[56:20.90]I can't even tell because I can't see a fucking map!
[56:25.03]I can't see a fucking map, so I don't know where I am!
[56:27.55]Mmm!
[56:44.39]I have the map for this place too.
[56:46.11]That's what's fucking so annoying.
[56:47.83]I have the map for this shit.
[56:59.78]Why am I turning into like a fucking Sesame Street character?
[57:05.08]Oh yeah, I'm so angry.
[57:14.77]Suddenly angry.
[57:15.55]It's because, like, why do I... Like, this fucking map shit, man.
[57:19.37]That's the one thing I really don't like about this game.
[57:26.06]Is the fact that you can go from, like, an area you have a map to, like, you have no idea where the fuck you are.
[57:31.48]Good luck.
[57:33.11]Now you see where you are again.
[57:36.43]That just makes me need to... Like, I'm gonna fucking pee my pants with shit like that.
[57:50.46]I'm more of a fog of war type of person, and I'm standing in acid.
[58:00.17]See, I find that to be an irritating deterrent, rather than, like, something that should be part of the game.
[58:05.91]Some people like that shit, I really don't.
[58:08.65]I find that to be, like, an annoying, like, extra deterrent to play.
[58:16.96]And now I'm, like, I'm angry again, and I'm just losing.
[58:20.25]Because like nothing substantial has happened this entire stream.
[58:24.01]I've literally been walking around in circles collecting items and shit.
[58:26.97]Who the fuck are you?
[58:27.69]What?
[58:28.75]Are you serious?
[58:30.78]Oh.
[58:52.30]oh something substantial I got a new ability yeah I got I got one new I did one thing in almost 48 minutes yeah like in almost a full hour has gone by and like somebody taught me how to swing my sword is a different way but thank you Mr. snake man for the 10 bucks
[59:18.86]It's easy to forget where you are when you're old.
[59:20.34]Hey, you can easily forget things when you're young, too.
[59:23.66]Alright, let's just go.
[59:27.20]This person is... Wait.
[59:31.70]Such luck this timing appears at just the right moment.
[59:33.78]And what masterful skill.
[59:35.42]As a warrior, it sets powerful precedent.
[59:36.76]I'll do well to learn from its form.
[59:38.54]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:41.74]I only get the flying ability... Yeah, but I haven't, like, done anything!
[59:46.54]All I've done is just damage boost through everything.
[59:50.70]Hold on.
[59:51.30]Everybody be quiet.
[59:54.66]Fuck.
[60:10.56]I'm just... Oh, my God.
[60:14.11]And here we go again.
[60:16.75]Let's run across the whole fucking game again.
[60:19.03]I can't wait.
[60:19.69]It's gonna be great.
[60:20.41]I'm so... I am so angry right now.
[60:29.21]It's like this is the problem with this stream.
[60:32.31]I spent an hour trying to go the right direction.
[60:35.35]And I learned a new move.
[60:40.77]I didn't say anything.
[60:41.60]Who said something?
[60:42.54]Somebody said, I heard somebody talk.
[60:44.14]Alright, I'm seriously gonna fucking, I gotta stop this right now.
[60:46.64]Like, stop this.
[60:47.22]Stop this!
[60:47.98]Stop this nonsense.
[60:49.78]Calm down, and fucking go get your body, and continue.
[60:53.36]Like, seriously.
[60:54.52]Cut the shit.
[60:56.52]Quit being such a fucking complainer.
[61:05.43]The game is designed to be like this.
[61:07.87]Stop pretending like it shouldn't be.
[61:11.96]The game is designed for you to, like, backtrack for fucking two hours.
[61:15.06]Like, that's what the game is designed to do.
[61:16.52]So just let it happen, have fun, and go for it.
[61:33.59]Fuck this.
[61:34.65]I'm doing it my way.
[61:44.91]Oh shit, somebody just gave 50 bucks.
[61:48.83]Why did you give $50 when I'm like sitting here like just being like a grumpy old shithead?
[61:59.95]Jeremy's in the angry stage of this roguelike.
[62:03.57]I jumped into that too.
[62:04.61]Hold on, let me see who just gave me $50.
[62:05.97]Give me one second.
[62:08.65]Alright, it's down there.
[62:13.59]Hold on.
[62:16.34]Uh, the Metallian says, I promise everything's going to be okay.
[62:21.29]Well, thank you, Metallian, for the $50.
[62:24.61]Thank you.
[62:25.29]I appreciate it.
[62:28.99]Thank you for the $50 spot.
[62:40.12]I need to go get my body, and then we gotta go back up.
[62:43.85]And now, like, enough of this, like... This is the way the game is.
[62:47.84]I knew what I was getting into.
[62:50.72]I knew what I signed up for.
[62:51.76]I signed up for getting lost for two hours.
[62:57.33]That's, like, what you do in these games.
[63:01.23]What did I think was gonna happen?
[63:02.99]Of course that was what was gonna happen.
[63:07.62]Let me try this.
[63:14.68]No, okay, he did it to me.
[63:17.98]Now he's running.
[63:20.14]Okay, bye.
[63:20.60]This used to be a gorilla's feel-good stream.
[63:28.43]Where is this thing?
[63:29.99]It's down here, right?
[63:39.03]These guys take a lot of hits.
[63:40.47]I think that's what's throwing me off big time.
[63:48.34]Get out of here.
[63:58.16]Okay.
[64:02.41]Hey, DubskiDude, thank you for the five dollars.
[64:04.85]They say... You say you're a regular guy, but you're my role model and inspiration.
[64:10.23]Your comedy means a lot to me.
[64:11.43]Can't wait to lovingly backstab you in Team Fortress.
[64:15.31]Also, our Jerma985 is lit.
[64:19.57]Well, you know, I check that subreddit from time to time.
[64:24.58]Pale ore.
[64:25.10]Wait a minute!
[64:26.88]I can upgrade my sword.
[64:29.90]Holy shit.
[64:30.66]Okay, hold on.
[64:32.28]I can bring that back to the blacksmith.
[64:35.72]God, this game just got so much more better.
[64:37.54]So much more better.
[64:43.82]This game seems like it would be less frustrating without the time constraints of streaming.
[64:51.06]I don't know.
[64:51.42]It's like it's... That's the thing with streaming anything, though.
[64:56.52]Here's some insider info for you guys, right?
[65:00.91]If I'm not streaming this game, I will... Did you see that, by the way?
[65:06.35]Did you see that one?
[65:07.61]Yeah.
[65:09.79]When you stream a game, at least for me,
[65:13.68]I want it to be like entertaining and worth watching and getting lost in a game like this off camera is you know, perfectly fine.
[65:22.64]And I would sit there and I would just get like a fucking chocolate milk and I would get lost for like three hours and not even care.
[65:29.31]But like that person was saying, it is... It's different when I'm streaming this because it's... I don't want to just sit here.
[65:36.90]I don't want to sit here like this for like 30 minutes and be like, okay, so that's where that is.
[65:42.82]That's where that is.
[65:45.18]There's a bench over there.
[65:48.44]Okay.
[65:49.42]Well, that kind of looks like a seesaw.
[65:51.48]I'm like, no, I want to play.
[65:52.94]I want you guys to watch.
[65:54.04]I want you guys to see, you know?
[65:56.13]I don't want to like...
[65:58.16]Have to have one of those streams where I just don't do anything and nothing gets done.
[66:01.16]I like to do things.
[66:02.82]I like to do things!
[66:10.01]Let's keep going.
[66:13.29]How did I already get this person?
[66:14.73]I was never even down here.
[66:24.45]And don't get me wrong, there's plenty of opportunities where I just don't even like...
[66:28.55]That's not a big deal to me at all.
[66:29.99]We're just kind of here, just chilling, having fun.
[66:31.75]Whoever's here is here, right?
[66:34.31]But... Still, I don't want to just sit here and just walk around in circles for four hours.
[66:44.22]Bottom... Where do I need to go?
[66:48.53]To the right?
[66:52.11]Hold on.
[66:52.89]Let me just look at that.
[67:00.37]No, I can't do this yet.
[67:10.46]I hate you.
[67:14.88]Okay.
[67:18.67]Oh, that's right, down here.
[67:21.27]Oh, now I remember this.
[67:22.39]I remember being so angry here.
[67:28.38]Yep.
[67:28.98]I remember being angry here.
[67:30.72]It's all coming back to me.
[67:36.19]Here it is.
[67:37.41]Here it is!
[67:38.11]There we go.
[67:40.31]What's this?
[67:48.66]Okay.
[67:55.02]Spot we've not been to it only took us an hour of a full hour of streaming Can't get up there.
[68:08.37]Yeah Interesting a dead end

[69:13.10]And I'll be fine.
[69:13.78]Oh.
[69:15.08]Okay.
[69:20.94]That way, we're just gonna keep progressing down.
[69:24.30]Watch out for the spikes.
[69:32.81]This is gonna be a boss right here.
[69:34.21]I know it.
[69:36.81]Why are you guys fail fishing already?
[69:38.13]Whoa!
[69:39.11]Oh, God.

[70:05.76]They're everywhere!
[70:13.99]These things are just everywhere!
[70:15.43]The ones on the ceiling are not... not cool.
[70:25.93]Oh, well, didn't expect to see you here.
[70:29.53]I thought you were gonna be dead.
[70:30.67]Now I have to suck up two of my Alienware juices.
[70:37.81]Hey, thank you, Weenie, for the five dollars.

[70:58.72]Like a confirmation if I'm gonna play Spore?
[71:02.56]Uh... I don't know.
[71:04.60]I don't like... I don't really plan things.
[71:08.59]It's like... I do kind of what I want to do for that week.
[71:12.21]So I'll... My planned stream... Like, oh, I'm gonna play Spore.
[71:17.57]If I just feel like playing Spore for like a night or two, it's just gonna happen.
[71:24.88]I do however, whatever I feel like doing and on any given day is what I'm going to do.
[71:31.03]Is this a sponsored stream?
[71:32.45]No, it is not.
[71:35.73]It is not a sponsored stream.
[71:38.87]I do not do sponsored streams.
[71:41.59]I don't.
[71:44.21]Where the hell am I going, by the way?
[71:49.19]Oh no, no, don't go in there yet.

[76:23.08]Finally.
[76:24.12]Finally I got the double jump.
[76:30.64]And it can be used after a dash or during a dash.
[76:35.20]That's amazing.
[76:39.59]Can it be used after doing like this?
[76:44.63]This seriously changes everything.

[76:47.43]That's fantastic.
[76:51.53]Alrighty.

[81:14.37]The dream version of this boss.
[81:15.89]What's that even mean?
[81:26.01]When you say dream version, does that mean I have to do something in here?
[81:33.02]Where am I now?
[81:39.12]I guess we're going this way.
[81:42.47]Should I not have done this?
[81:46.89]I'm not going to lose everything, am I?
[82:01.83]I don't know if I should have done that.
[82:04.77]Okay.
[82:05.27]Lost king.
[82:06.69]Okay.
[82:10.42]Let's go!
[82:12.10]You guys wanna see it?
[82:13.16]Fine!
[82:14.26]First try!
[82:15.30]Dream boss!
[82:27.85]so so
[83:08.72]I beat him!
[83:19.48]I didn't!
[83:21.08]Look, I got out of the dream.
[83:22.17]I beat him first fucking try.
[83:23.61]I just beat him.
[83:27.63]I'm out.
[83:29.03]I escaped the dream.
[83:30.03]I just beat him first try.
[83:47.33]You can just do that again.
[83:48.25]I kind of want to do this again.
[83:52.88]Go back in there.
[83:54.44]I think I could do this if I was quiet enough.
[84:06.77]I just want to skip this part.
[84:07.99]This part was cool the first time.
[84:09.85]I just want to go to the boss.
[84:13.99]I don't want to go down the fucking jokey stairway.
[84:21.34]No, shit!
[84:28.08]Excuse me!
[84:29.08]Excuse me!
[84:29.97]Where's my... I just did it again!
[84:31.37]I beat it again a second time.
[84:33.75]I just beat it again.
[84:34.73]You guys want to see me beat it a third time?
[84:36.87]You want to see me get out of the dream three times in a row?
[84:41.31]Sure thing.
[84:55.20]I did it again.
[84:55.90]I'll do it three times.
[84:58.20]You guys want to see somebody beat that shit three times in a row?
[85:00.53]Alright, here we go.
[85:27.34]Dammit.
[86:02.94]Wrong button.
[86:04.08]Okay.
[86:51.18]I can beat this.
[86:52.34]I really can.
[86:53.60]I got crossed up.
[86:56.02]I hit right trigger instead of circle.
[86:58.14]I got really crossed up there.
[86:59.04]I'll beat him right now.
[87:11.06]That's the worst thing that happens in games like this.
[87:12.86]When you get super crossed up with your moves.
[87:16.12]Like, oh, dash, jump, jump, jump, dash, uh, charge up, move down.
[87:20.41]Oh, I pressed the wrong button.
[87:22.87]Let's go.
[87:46.30]Fuck, crossed up again.
[88:29.98]Aye, aye, aye.
[89:23.46]No!
[89:24.22]No!
[89:24.70]God damn it!
[89:27.06]Oh, I get st- Oh, that was so close.
[89:32.38]Okay, one more try.
[89:33.80]Fucking hell.
[89:39.07]Oh, I'm getting so greedy.
[89:41.05]Ah.
[89:45.18]That was it too.
[89:46.20]I needed one more phase and that was it.
[89:48.92]One more try.
[89:51.40]Let's go, come on.
[89:52.26]I'm already getting greedy.
[90:31.05]Shit.
[90:37.96]I think I lost it already.
[90:38.86]Yeah, I lost it.
[90:43.82]Gonna take some fucking miracle here.
[90:58.59]Yeah, I got it.
[91:00.27]Let's go.
[91:05.31]I just get too crossed up.
[91:08.85]Fucking hell.
[91:09.87]I want to do this.
[91:10.77]I want to try this again.
[91:14.05]No, I'm just like so much.
[91:15.21]I'm like so on edge Stop throwing I can't you when you play games like this you just you throw after like okay, there you go I almost beat him last to that last time he was very close and Now when you lose when you're that close you're just like I fucking hate my life Let's take it slow
[91:57.52]So you gotta worry about those things more than him.
[92:02.64]Like, those things gotta go immediately.
[92:06.75]Ah, got bounced around.
[92:19.79]Shit, I'm in a bad spot right now.
[92:24.01]Okay.
[93:05.63]There we go.
[93:15.52]Wrong button again.
[93:16.30]Fuck.
[93:29.93]Okay.
[94:32.86]Shit!
[94:33.06]Thought he was jumping over me.
[94:45.17]That's it!
[94:46.29]That's not it!
[94:47.43]That's not it, holy shit!
[94:50.65]Wow!
[94:54.49]That's- okay.
[94:55.97]He- I wasn't close, apparently.
[94:58.13]That was- I got like three more phases.
[95:03.44]Oh my lord.
[95:04.10]Alright, I'll do that.
[95:05.52]Look, I still need to sword upgrade.
[95:07.62]You know what I mean?
[95:10.97]Like, I gotta come back here when I can, like, actually beat this guy.
[95:17.65]That is, like, too much health.
[95:22.01]Okay.
[95:24.02]Why am I an idiot?
[95:28.57]I don't understand, why does that make me an idiot?
[95:30.77]That I can't be, like, a hard boss in the game right now.
[95:33.61]Does anyone understand that?
[95:34.77]Why am I an idiot?
[95:35.53]That guy's fucking extremely difficult.
[95:39.65]Like, what?
[95:47.46]I can feel his red face.
[95:49.50]No, I, look, sometimes you just accept defeat, and I'll come back when I get the second sword upgrade.
[95:58.82]Like, apparently I'm fighting him without that upgrade.
[96:02.25]And I can really use it.
[96:17.02]Like, can I do that without the next upgrade?
[96:19.68]Sure.
[96:20.92]But, ow.
[96:22.58]But it's, um... Like, I'm just not doing myself any favors.
[96:35.61]You lost because you suck.
[96:39.95]Oh, you know what?
[96:40.79]Fuck you.
[96:41.57]How does that sound?
[96:44.51]Fuck off.
[96:46.51]It's not easy.
[96:51.06]You do it.
[96:53.92]Let me see your fucking stats.
[96:55.34]Am I supposed to be going this way?
[97:04.41]I think so.
[97:09.38]I feel like I'm supposed to be going this way.
[97:13.83]Maybe the super dash?
[97:22.78]Can you do it?
[97:23.34]Come on.
[97:28.02]Am I just so angry that I can't even play this game right now?
[97:33.77]I think so.
[97:38.62]There you go.
[97:43.06]Where the hell did you come from?
[97:51.27]At least I got it.
[97:59.21]No, give me a break!
[98:01.03]Look, if people are gonna tell me that I suck and shit, like, you suck!
[98:05.00]You know what I mean?
[98:05.50]Like, fuck you!
[98:12.68]I can't defend myself?
[98:14.74]That's bullshit.
[98:16.72]If someone's gonna tell me to go fuck themselves, if someone's gonna say, hey, go fuck yourself, I'm gonna be like, you know what, you go fuck yourself.
[98:22.29]How does that sound?
[98:23.45]I ain't gonna sit here unless somebody tells me to go fuck myself.
[98:34.43]No, you go fuck yourself, you know what I mean?
[98:44.06]What's over here?
[98:48.80]Like, if somebody tells me to eat their ass, I'm gonna be like, no.
[98:51.90]Like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[98:54.16]No.
[98:54.84]Go eat your own ass.
[98:58.99]You do that.
[98:59.83]Deal with it.
[99:05.73]Oh, no.
[99:08.43]Not this shit again.
[99:17.27]Hello?
[99:20.58]He's blocking it.
[99:21.22]I guess I get the better version of that.
[99:29.54]We can come back, I think.
[99:43.16]Now look, I know it's a joke.
[99:44.36]I know there's like a lot of jokes.
[99:45.64]People are like, oh, you suck.
[99:46.62]But there are like actually people that are mad that I didn't just beat that boss.
[99:50.98]That are truly fucking upset with me and like, and are mad at me that I didn't beat that boss.
[99:58.97]So you need a fucking hobby.
[100:02.57]Go get a hobby.
[100:04.17]Go take up pottery making.
[100:14.28]Uh, I think I'm done here, by the way.
[100:15.53]Okay, go take like a pottery class.
[100:31.10]It'll make you feel better.
[100:31.90]Okay, uh, deep nest?
[100:43.63]Uh, Deepnest it is.
[100:49.86]Oh, I can't go that way to go to Deepnest.
[100:51.37]I gotta go down and left.
[101:12.48]Can I go to deepness through here?
[101:14.94]I think so.
[101:19.62]Although I don't remember.
[101:20.38]I'm kind of just like sprinting through.
[101:26.07]No, I didn't do this right at all.
[101:29.69]In fact, I'm going to die down here.
[101:31.83]I'm going to die over here.
[101:32.75]The stray bullet almost just hit me right in the head.
[101:49.14]No, not this way.
[101:49.78]How did I get there before?
[102:04.53]You die now.
[102:05.28]I was so hoping that was going to hit him.
[102:13.04]I kind of was too.
[102:28.59]So we're at that stage where I have no idea where to go because I have a new ability.
[102:32.77]And I don't know where to use it.
[102:38.34]Well, let's just go up.
[102:50.84]I'm gonna go up.
[102:58.54]Let's see if I can... take a look here.
[103:05.87]Okay, this way.
[103:09.01]Where am I now?
[103:09.97]All the fucking way over here in East Shitsville.
[103:15.43]So if I go up... I gotta go to the Queen Station?
[103:21.82]Or left from here?
[103:22.68]I don't even know, whatever.
[103:35.54]I don't know.
[103:40.84]I don't have a map of this one tiny specific area, so I don't know where I'm going.
[103:56.82]This is bringing me back to King Station, isn't it?
[103:58.62]I don't know.
[104:16.21]I kind of want to go buy it.
[104:17.05]I have money.
[104:17.95]I kind of want to spend it.
[104:26.07]Like, I have money.
[104:27.09]Hmm.
[104:31.63]What do I buy, though?
[104:34.11]Another notch on the belt?
[104:43.99]Yeah, I'm just gonna go to the stag.
[104:58.90]I don't know why I'm fighting this guy.
[105:03.22]There's no reason to.
[105:04.24]I'm just gonna go to the stag.
[105:07.92]Right.
[105:13.62]You're in a Humpty Dumpty.
[105:15.50]What is this?
[105:20.36]Oh.
[105:26.25]Be free!
[105:26.59]Okay, well that was easy enough.
[105:32.19]Oh fuck, the door is closed!
[105:33.21]The door is locked!
[105:34.51]Jesus!
[105:54.28]God, don't even do this to me now.
[106:04.79]Come on and die already, please.
[106:09.92]Ow.
[106:26.27]Finally.
[106:34.48]Well.
[106:36.36]Keep going this way.
[106:45.02]Into the station.
[106:45.76]Not that way.
[106:50.61]Upgrade my nail.
[106:51.37]Yeah, I'll do that too.
[106:52.57]There's a few things I need to do.
[106:56.11]Don't use the weak attack.
[106:57.63]I'm just gonna.
[106:58.73]Just to get away from it.
[107:02.45]Okay.
[107:03.31]Where is the blacksmith?
[107:11.64]He's like that little egg right there, right?
[107:14.32]Is that the blacksmith?
[107:17.74]No, it's that guy right there.
[107:21.96]So actually I need to go back the other way, don't I?
[107:29.47]When it says vendor, I really wish it would say exactly what they are.
[107:35.87]So I gotta go that way.
[107:37.09]Alright, we have to go left.
[107:39.47]I'm just gonna keep going that way.
[107:43.49]I do want to do that before I forget about it and completely lose track of everything.
[107:57.36]Yeah, it's just this way, this way, this way, this way, this way, this way.
[107:59.98]We're going for the lazy streamer skip.
[108:04.32]There it was.
[108:08.20]By there it was, I mean this is it here.
[108:13.45]No, not that way.
[108:22.09]Hmm.
[108:29.36]Really?
[108:29.60]Did I hit the guy in the mohawk?
[108:35.15]Saving frames.
[108:36.01]Yeah, I was just saving frames.
[108:37.55]Oh no, I have to stop this.
[108:51.08]I'm scared to do that.
[108:59.44]Wow.
[109:04.13]Good thing that guy... There's too many small little lips for me to run into here, so... I'm just going to do the old-fashioned one.
[109:13.72]This way.
[109:14.60]Okay.
[109:14.70]Okay.
[109:28.05]That works.
[109:32.88]I'm back for you to upgrade by nail.

[110:50.57]This is true.
[110:52.61]True message.
[110:55.09]I got some pale ore, a rarefying metal deck.
[110:56.71]Give me that and some geo for my efforts and I'll reforge your nail.
[111:01.80]Oh, thank God I came here with the right amount of money.

[111:08.53]Might as well spend it somewhere.
[111:09.53]I'm going to be spending it here.
[111:11.15]Reforge.
[111:14.01]Make this shit stronger, dude.
[111:15.81]I had just barely enough to do that.
[111:23.92]I've added a channel to your nail.
[111:25.42]It should cut more efficiently.
[111:26.78]You'll find it stronger than it used to be.
[111:28.92]Test the blade.
[111:34.00]Ooh.
[111:34.90]That's pretty looking.
[111:37.38]Thank you.
[111:40.26]To forge the perfect nail.
[111:50.61]Alright, well that is done.
[111:51.69]I don't even know where I'm gonna end up, who knows.
[111:59.55]Alright, we're good.
[112:11.62]When's the next comb stream?
[112:12.68]I don't know.
[112:17.20]That's a good question.
[112:18.36]When is the next comb stream?
[112:22.54]Not tonight.
[112:23.78]Maybe tomorrow at the end of the stream we'll do that.
[112:26.76]I don't know.
[112:27.86]I don't know.
[112:30.30]Okay.
[112:31.63]Where am I going next?
[112:34.31]Deep nest.
[112:39.93]You know, and like the time it's gonna take me to go up and all the way around.
[112:45.39]I might as well just walk there.
[112:47.31]Like, I'm just gonna walk there from here.
[112:50.87]Up and to the left.
[112:51.47]I need this.
[112:57.51]I seem stressed today.
[112:58.65]I mean, like... Today?
[113:04.28]Maybe.
[113:04.46]Maybe today.
[113:09.38]Maybe today.
[113:11.32]I'm fine, though.
[113:11.90]Don't worry about me.
[113:24.15]Lost kin?
[113:24.75]No.
[113:25.07]I'm going to do deep best.
[113:26.20]I'm going to do the sure thing.
[113:44.76]What am I never stressed?
[113:45.76]You know, that's a point.
[113:47.84]That is a point.
[113:57.34]I'm worried?
[113:57.92]Why are you worried?
[114:02.98]He got bullied?
[114:05.48]No, I didn't.
[114:06.24]I didn't.
[114:07.90]I really didn't.
[114:12.38]Where am I?
[114:12.87]This way, right?
[114:15.26]I fucked it up.
[114:20.01]I gotta go back down that way and left.
[114:21.49]Yeah, this way.
[114:45.70]I guess I can escape this now, because I have the jump.
[114:50.10]Interestingly enough, or not.
[114:51.98]Oh yeah, I can.
[114:57.65]Leads us to here.
[114:58.99]Dash across this.
[115:07.22]Sounded like real anger.
[115:08.36]Oh no, I was very angry at that boss.
[115:11.12]But you gotta give me a little bit of credit, right?
[115:12.74]So you guys, we all play games.
[115:14.19]We all play video games.
[115:15.21]That's what we do.
[115:16.05]We play games.
[115:17.35]Sometimes you have trouble with certain things.
[115:22.05]And sometimes when you have trouble, if one of your friends was over your house, right?
[115:26.24]Because we're all friends here.
[115:28.20]One of your friends is over your house, and you're having trouble with the boss.
[115:31.58]And, like, you're having trouble, and you're getting closer, you're getting closer, you're getting closer, and you lose, and you lose, and you lose, and your friend is like, You suck!
[115:40.33]You're not gonna, like, do one of these, like, Motherfucker, what?
[115:45.29]Shut up!
[115:46.57]I'm trying to do this!
[115:49.34]Like, that's what's gonna happen.
[116:03.19]That's what I would do if Burgah Boy was over my house right now and he did that.
[116:07.69]I'd be like, Burgah Boy, Burgah Boy, shut the fuck up, Burgah Boy.
[116:11.63]Okay?
[116:14.47]It's hard.
[116:15.11]I'm trying.
[116:15.83]Fuck you.
[116:17.59]That's what I would say.
[116:18.41]That's actually exactly what my friend does.
[116:23.95]Yeah.
[116:24.49]And you probably say, you probably tell him to shut the fuck up.
[116:28.60]And he probably goes, what?
[116:32.74]Just come on.
[116:35.32]And then they give him one of those, it's not my fault.
[116:37.30]It's not my fault that you suck this bad.
[116:38.82]It's not my fault that you suck so bad.
[116:40.38]It's like, no, it's not your fault.
[116:46.63]I don't want to go up there yet.
[116:59.23]I'm going to go this way.
[117:07.44]Another one of these things.
[117:12.54]I'm gonna spread out all over the place.
[117:15.52]It's 21, right?
[117:16.84]22?
[117:20.83]Dear me, we're not your friends.
[117:22.21]What?
[117:22.35]Are you serious?
[117:26.63]I keep telling people that I have, like, thousands of internet friends.
[117:29.77]Is that not true?
[117:35.87]That's how I get my discount at, like, CVS.
[117:39.99]They go, CVS, do you have a CVS card?
[117:43.31]No, I have a bunch of internet friends.
[117:45.73]Oh, okay.
[117:46.83]Well, that vitamin water will be 14 cents cheaper.
[117:49.53]And I'm like, yes!
[117:50.25]I feel like there's a breakable wall over here, and I want to know.
[118:08.39]Well, whatever.
[118:09.61]We need to go this way anyways.
[118:11.04]We need to go over here and then down.
[118:12.84]Nope.
[118:14.00]I was going the right way.
[118:19.80]Thank you, Mitzi, for the 10 bucks.
[118:21.56]Appreciate it.
[118:25.31]CVS brand sparkling water is good.
[118:28.23]Is it really?
[118:30.63]But, yo, thank you, Mitzi.
[118:31.45]700. 700.
[118:33.44]Please donate your bits to stop me from getting bullied.
[118:36.48]No, it was like, you know, it was one person.
[118:39.18]One fucking person said it.
[118:40.97]And it put me, like, over the edge.
[118:45.61]I saw one fucking thing in chat that was like, wow, this guy really sucks.
[118:49.03]And I'm just like, I... Hey!
[118:53.47]Cat urine.
[118:57.34]I mean, vitamin water does suck.
[119:08.95]straight down dude like I could be at like a I could be holding like a rally or something like hey welcome everyone welcome to the Jerma rally and I get at a podium I'm like thank you thank you thank you let's talk about let's talk about the issues here like the streaming issues
[119:28.24]And like one guy, the crowd could be fucking cheering, right?
[119:32.64]There could be like 50,000 people in this crowd all cheering my name.
[119:36.84]Like, oh, we're at like TwitchCon and like the StreamCon and a Jerma panel.
[119:41.48]And like people are fucking all chanting and screaming for me and like fucking showing signs and saying like, oh, I love you.
[119:47.03]And I hear one guy in that audience say, this guy's a fucking tool.
[119:52.45]I'm going to like get off the podium and be like, who said that?
[119:54.69]Who said that?
[119:55.85]Who said that?
[119:56.73]Where is he?
[119:57.21]And I'm gonna push people out of the way and be like, get out of the way, I need to find this guy.
[120:00.17]Who said it?
[120:04.82]So, yeah, it's like... You know?
[120:14.71]Find that guy.
[120:15.65]Security, find that guy.
[120:18.47]Find that guy and tell him that I said, fuck you.
[120:28.82]I could never run for president.
[120:31.92]Somebody on like CNN, or like CBS, or like Fox, or whatever the fuck, would just be like, oh, so, uh, Jerma985, why are they calling me Jerma985, by the way?
[120:42.69]Jerma985, uh, was seen at, um, at Wendy's last night, and he said that, uh, he doesn't mind the, oh, hold on, do I have to fight these guys again?
[120:53.83]No.
[120:57.11]Oh, gee, there's Wendy's and, uh, wow, you know, he looked like he was eating that hot dog really strangely.
[121:02.61]He was eating that hamburger really strangely.
[121:04.97]Uh, you know, and he's kind of ugly.
[121:08.21]I would, like, go to CNN headquarters and be like, who said I was ugly?
[121:15.81]Can I not go underneath there?
[121:16.58]Oh, he was shitting his pants at a local gym.
[121:32.35]Yeah, Wendy says hot dogs.
[121:33.47]You guys didn't know that?
[121:39.95]I'm one of those people.
[121:40.89]Let me give you the long and short of it.
[121:42.59]I'm one of those people that if somebody makes fun of me for real, I need to be like, hey, why?
[121:49.46]Why are you saying that?
[121:51.16]Don't you know that you shouldn't be being like that?
[121:52.90]Don't be so mean.
[121:56.69]And then, like, yeah, like, what a hypocrite.
[121:58.27]Because, like, I've... You guys have seen me talk plenty of shit.
[122:08.50]Oh, new enemies.
[122:15.32]Now, I would want to go on, like, CNN and, like, debate the guy or something.
[122:19.42]I would go on, like, CBS and do, like, a live debate.
[122:23.43]And all they'd have to do is just say something like, oh, by the way, you... Mr. 985.
[122:29.83]So you're running for president of the United States.
[122:32.49]Yes, I am.
[122:33.43]Well, that's very interesting.
[122:34.27]You have very good credentials.
[122:35.29]I see you're completely qualified for the job.
[122:38.55]But there's one thing in particular I wanted to ask you about.
[122:41.53]A direct question.
[122:43.43]You couldn't beat that dream boss.
[122:45.89]Is that because you just suck at games?
[122:48.73]And I would just be like... Listen!
[122:51.65]Listen, Anderson Cooper!
[122:54.08]How dare you bring up shit like that from the past?
[122:59.62]You and your majestic, wonderful, beautiful head of pure, like, just straight-up silver hair.
[123:10.70]Your silver-haired dragon, is what I'd call him.
[123:16.80]And I'd get thrown off the set.
[123:28.71]You guys know that Anderson Cooper's hair is made out of pure silver.
[123:31.90]It's silver.
[123:38.96]That's not actually hair.
[123:40.72]That's a precious metal.
[123:45.13]Where the hell am I going?
[123:55.26]Ah, shit.
[124:00.24]Oh, by the way, nothing I'm saying is true.
[124:03.66]You guys can talk all the shit you want.
[124:05.06]I don't care.
[124:08.21]It's just in the moment when somebody makes fun of you for being bad at something, and you know you're being bad at something, and you're trying to improve.
[124:16.62]Sometimes you gotta throw a tomato, right?
[124:19.78]Hey, what's that old saying?
[124:21.40]You can't make a soup unless you throw a tomato.
[124:24.40]Right?
[124:25.46]What's the saying?
[124:29.24]You can't make bread unless you need that dough, right?
[124:32.94]However that goes.
[124:33.46]Do I just have to make it to the top of this?
[124:44.59]I'm not sure.
[124:55.69]What?
[124:56.01]Did somebody just knock me back into the...
[125:00.15]Yeah, that's what it is.
[125:00.79]Can't make an omelet without cracking a few eggs.
[125:02.97]Mine was close enough.
[125:11.77]Wait, did that ground just move?
[125:17.52]It did.
[125:19.70]This place is weird.
[125:20.46]It's like a burrow.
[125:21.54]I kind of like the music, too.
[125:23.04]It's really creepy and weird.
[125:24.22]I really especially like the enemies that come out of nowhere in the ground.
[125:28.06]I like that, too.
[125:34.70]I guess we're... I don't know.
[125:44.67]There's this exit over here.
[125:46.93]What does that even do for me, though?
[125:52.87]Doesn't seem like it does much.
[125:53.82]Mm-hmm.
[125:58.84]Not yet.
[125:59.28]Ugh.
[126:02.65]Come on, I just want to heal.
[126:03.93]Get out of here.
[126:04.59]Get out of here, you little dumb bugs.
[126:26.76]Um... I'm gonna fungal wastes now.
[126:36.49]Oh dear.
[126:39.56]Well, we aren't doing that yet.
[126:43.24]I'm sorry for calling you an idiot earlier.
[126:44.90]I just want to apologize and move on.
[126:50.86]I'm gone.
[126:53.35]Well, look at that happen.
[126:57.41]That was a thing.
[127:03.01]Well, that happened.
[127:11.90]Just don't die because I'm being sloppy here Secret Secret into the fungal wastes Okay Just another way to go there
[127:41.31]Hi, Jermua.
[127:41.85]Hi, SpiderPenguin1.
[127:44.51]What's going on, SpiderPenguin1?
[127:46.13]Hope your day is going good.
[127:57.85]Hmm.
[127:59.75]Well, I guess we're just going to see what this is.
[128:03.71]I guess.
[128:04.89]This is obviously a boss, but, you know.
[128:07.99]No, we're not.
[128:08.69]No, we're not.
[128:09.13]No, we are not going to do this.
[128:12.99]I need a... I need a bench.
[128:26.90]Really?
[128:30.22]Is there no bench here?
[128:31.24]All the way down lower left, maybe?
[128:37.63]I so desperately need a bench here.
[128:39.47]I don't want to fight like a boss right now.
[128:41.45]Not like this second.
[128:42.95]Because I don't want to have to run all the way back here.
[128:47.04]Mod who?
[128:47.40]Mod who?
[128:49.56]What are you guys... What are you talking about?
[129:01.76]I just want to look at the fucking map.
[129:03.36]Like, really.
[129:04.04]Can I please just look at the map for a second so I can see what I'm doing here?
[129:10.89]I don't like the fact that they just spawn right underneath you.
[129:14.20]That is so annoying.
[129:16.94]They could come from fucking anywhere.
[129:27.14]I can't even see them!
[129:28.98]Yeah, we're gonna take a trip down though, before we left.
[129:44.09]No, I'm not modding.
[129:47.07]We already did that joke.
[129:49.81]Getting sloppy, yeah.
[129:56.44]I know.
[129:58.16]I'm getting stuck here, too.
[130:03.18]Dirt bugs.
[130:22.21]Alright, this way.
[130:22.91]What?
[130:32.32]You probably break down through this.
[130:33.86]It's probably a shortcut.
[130:39.06]Oh, that's it.
[130:42.66]Damn.
[130:43.92]Only these one, two places?
[130:45.04]Come on, please have there be a bench right here somewhere.
[130:48.70]Come on.
[130:49.26]I really don't want to have to run all the way back if I die.
[130:52.20]That doesn't sound like very much fun to me.
[131:09.29]Whoa.
[131:10.13]Well, there's that.
[131:10.75]Let's try going down here.
[131:20.73]That's, like, so unfair.
[131:32.34]There's gotta be something in here, right?
[131:42.73]I refuse to believe that there's no... ...spot to hang my coat.
[131:57.24]This is actually a long ways away from the thing.
[132:02.75]Oh dear, now we're getting real lost.
[132:09.54]Oh dear.
[132:10.68]Oh dear.
[132:12.18]Oh dear.
[132:13.14]Oh dear.
[132:14.36]Oh dear.
[132:14.74]Oh.
[132:17.80]Dear?
[132:18.08]I found it.
[132:23.99]Found it.
[132:27.17]I guess, and there's a hot spring.
[132:33.90]Where am I now?
[132:35.38]Alright.
[132:35.88]Cool.
[132:37.44]Found the bench!
[132:45.08]Keep exploring deep dust, I guess.
[132:48.96]Yeah, I haven't been over here.
[132:54.95]Secret!
[133:02.73]I went full piglet there for a minute.
[133:04.70]Oh, dear.
[133:06.72]Oh, dear.
[133:07.60]Oh, poo.
[133:08.18]Alright, let's just keep going.
[133:24.23]Uh, hold on.
[133:26.69]Thank you to Von Skellyman for the $2.50.
[133:31.17]He's just too compact.
[133:32.77]He has too much anger.
[133:34.15]Too much anger compacted into one spot.
[133:39.23]You're right.
[133:40.24]Secret within a secret, guys.
[133:43.12]I mean, we're getting deep here.
[133:47.68]Secret inside of a secret.
[133:50.02]That's me.
[133:51.24]What am I doing down there?
[133:52.80]What the fuck is that?
[133:57.63]Why am I over here?
[134:00.11]What?
[134:07.05]So confused right now.
[134:13.21]Missed the caterpillar.
[134:13.99]Oh, I'm going back.
[134:14.97]Just wanted to see what else was down here.
[134:19.54]Secret within a secret within a secret, guys.
[134:22.74]Secret inside the secret inside of a secret.
[134:26.16]It's one of those, like, eggs.
[134:34.92]One of those secret eggs.
[134:40.66]There he goes, get him!
[134:42.44]What is that?
[134:59.22]What's going on here?
[135:01.84]Oh.
[135:04.06]Oh, shit.
[135:05.82]Oh, shit.
[135:07.04]Oh, shit.
[135:10.71]This is a secret boss.
[135:13.13]Fucking spider person.
[135:15.53]No!
[135:16.79]No!
[135:17.71]Calm down.
[135:18.07]Alright, hopefully this person's an idiot.
[135:45.44]Alright, you're kind of a dumbass.
[135:46.38]It's okay though.
[135:47.94]Don't be too cocky.
[135:53.46]Cockiness is the end of all things.
[135:54.97]I went the wrong way.
[136:15.23]When she makes the noise is when he comes back this way.
[136:19.44]That's the sprint noise.
[136:31.14]Come on.
[136:37.92]I'm taking this very cautiously.
[136:47.49]Unless this phase changes like crazy, this is really not that bad.
[136:50.80]I'm sure it's gonna change.
[136:53.96]Why wouldn't it?
[137:20.56]She speeds up.
[137:23.92]No big deal.
[137:32.79]I could probably just do this.
[137:35.37]Yeah, I don't know why I'm not doing this.
[137:38.97]Whoops, that's probably why I'm not doing that.
[137:44.14]Well, that's why.
[137:49.88]Alright, well, now that I know, I got confidence now.
[137:51.26]Come on, let's go.
[138:00.73]You're dead.
[138:02.69]Okay, that was extremely easy.
[138:05.93]I'm glad you gave me, like, a dumb easy boss.
[138:10.69]Whoops.
[138:12.36]Do I need to talk to it or something?
[138:18.06]What if I do, like, the dream thing?
[138:21.17]No.
[138:23.89]Okay.
[138:26.51]Well, that was... That was, I guess... Let's see if it was worth it.
[138:31.92]Pale... Oh.
[138:39.13]I need... Okay, cool.
[138:41.93]I guess it was worth it.
[138:55.36]Now, am I missing something else or is there a way to get out of here faster?
[138:58.44]Or no?
[139:03.44]Is that the only thing that was down here?
[139:08.64]I do have a bunch of money in the bank.
[139:09.60]I want to keep that money in the bank, though, for the next nail upgrade.
[139:13.69]Because it's fairly expensive, is it not?
[139:24.66]Now I can go get the caterpillar.
[139:27.34]That's somewhere in here.
[139:28.28]There he is.
[139:32.08]Ray!
[139:33.98]I have rescued you.
[139:37.54]You're saved.
[139:40.53]Hello?
[139:41.47]What's happening?
[139:44.07]I'm just coming to say hello.
[139:45.11]Just coming to say hello.
[139:46.37]I've got to leave in a couple minutes anyways to preheat the oven.
[139:49.37]Chicken parmesan.
[139:50.31]Chicken parmesan.
[139:51.85]Chicken parmesan.
[139:55.31]Alright, well, um... What the... What the F?
[140:04.45]I got the caterpillar, so... I'm just running into some shit while I die.
[140:08.96]Not a big deal.
[140:10.42]Put every single geo... No, I'm not gonna put every single one in the bank.
[140:14.32]Putting every single geo in the bank means I can't, like, buy maps and shit.
[140:21.10]So we're back here.
[140:23.11]Update my fucking map.
[140:25.50]And then shove that map back into my pocket.
[140:30.02]Everything over there.
[140:30.72]Let's go this way.
[140:35.95]What is that?
[140:37.79]I don't know.
[140:41.03]Whatever it is, it's really loud.
[140:44.23]It's this shit again, but like five times louder.
[140:46.83]I'm sorry.
[140:48.65]I apologize in advance.
[140:49.67]This shit is fucking loud.
[140:54.47]Oh.
[140:56.90]I guess I'm going to go this way.
[141:00.73]Down to the right.
[141:05.41]Go down.
[141:10.02]Was that even the boss of Deepnest?
[141:12.28]Or was that just some secret little boss to get the pale ore?
[141:16.74]Or is there actually a named real boss here?
[141:21.64]I say that right now, and all of a sudden, here we are.
[141:23.82]Can I get through this with this thing?
[141:26.38]No.
[141:29.42]So there's another upgrade eventually, I guess, right?
[141:33.93]Not really, that was a secret optional boss.
[141:35.43]Okay.
[141:37.85]Well, we don't have the ability to go through those things, so... Oh, we're just gonna go.
[141:42.49]Or are we?
[141:44.27]No, we're not.
[141:47.63]Huh.
[141:49.59]Back up?
[141:51.77]And to the right?
[141:54.90]I guess.
[141:58.02]At least a few hours ago.
[142:06.36]I didn't get very much either.
[142:08.65]I think so.
[142:14.51]It's not a big deal.
[142:15.25]What's the matter, Otto?
[142:16.81]Oh my god, I'm getting blocked in here.
[142:20.13]Doesn't matter.
[142:21.11]Give me one second, guys.
[142:21.83]I'm going to have to come to the conclusion of what my dog wants.
[142:25.52]He's currently looking at me and he's like, I want something.
[142:27.77]I don't know what it is.
[142:28.39]He's going to be like, do it.
[145:00.03]And there it is again.
[145:00.60]There's the black screen again.
[145:04.74]I turned this down.
[145:05.48]Hopefully it wasn't that loud.
[145:10.18]I came back to it now.
[145:10.90]I'm just like, ow, my ears.
[145:13.71]Can I break through that?
[145:20.73]No.
[145:21.71]Ow.
[145:24.31]Oh, whoops.
[145:33.84]20 000 people watching the black screen oh what a what a wonderful black screen am I going to the right I guess I can drop here yeah
[145:57.64]I wonder if I should actually be trying to kill these things.
[146:02.95]Probably not.
[146:12.69]Um... A door with an open slot.
[146:16.61]Door with an open slot.
[146:20.71]Sure thing.
[146:24.96]There's nothing here.
[146:25.64]Is that one of these insignia doors or something?
[146:28.75]I don't even know.
[146:32.21]Well, shit.
[147:02.39]Get up there, please!
[147:06.13]Nah, I could've gone that way.
[147:07.29]I'm an idiot.
[147:09.45]Boss time?
[147:11.91]Where's this boss you speak of?
[147:28.31]What is the game?
[147:29.10]What am I currently enjoying?
[147:31.18]This?
[147:31.54]I'm currently enjoying this game.
[147:38.06]I could go back and fight the dream boss again, couldn't I?
[147:41.85]I could, if I really wanted to.
[147:56.92]The boss I didn't want to fight.
[147:58.64]Oh, that's right.
[147:59.25]All the way up that top left.
[148:00.67]Okay.
[148:02.19]Yep.
[148:04.37]Yeah, it's easy to forget because you're just all over the place.
[148:07.73]Should I bounce on the next one that comes out?
[148:13.84]There's so many ways to go in this game.
[148:16.36]There's so many places to explore and so many things to do that it's very easy to forget what the hell you were just doing.
[148:27.95]Come on.
[148:28.55]That was fucking bullshit.
[148:30.01]That was so fucking stupid.
[148:35.40]He walked by and now here we go again.
[148:39.82]Here we go again.
[148:42.56]I get inside my own head to a point where I fucking can't do it.
[149:00.68]Let's go.
[149:01.20]Hurry the fuck up.
[149:16.13]Internalize it.
[149:17.03]Bury your feelings.
[149:25.15]Where is he?
[149:26.65]Where is he?
[149:27.09]Why is he not over here?
[149:37.93]Oh god, I'm getting stuck.
[149:39.73]Oh shit, he's still going.
[149:56.98]Where is this even leading me?
[150:05.05]Wait, what?
[150:05.73]Oh shit.
[150:12.58]What did that even do?
[150:13.22]Oh.
[150:18.72]Nice.
[150:19.08]Now, what is that?
[150:19.84]Completing this gives me what?
[150:26.24]Um.
[150:28.89]An extra, like, notch or something?
[150:34.45]Cool.
[150:37.13]Trust me.
[150:37.49]If he pees loudly again, he's gonna get his third strike.
[150:48.61]Right, so that's an ancient basin.
[150:54.35]Top left.
[150:55.05]So we're going to go back this way.
[150:58.97]Right, yeah.
[151:01.33]I guess I can store more than one soul thing now.
[151:03.79]That's cool.
[151:19.34]Here we are.
[151:21.10]Excellent.
[151:22.55]Sit in the hot springs for a second while we take a look at the map.
[151:24.61]So, I had to go... to the left, right?
[151:29.59]Was it left and up, or was it up all the way up?
[151:33.45]I'm trying to piece together and remember where the hell it was.
[151:52.76]Still go over there.
[152:02.44]Gotta go up.
[152:04.81]Up, up, up, up, up.
[152:06.61]Oh, that stinks.
[152:10.71]That stinks.
[152:11.73]Gonna have to go all the way back this way.
[152:23.91]Oh shit, didn't want to do that.
[152:29.84]I haven't gone this way.
[152:35.34]Just take a look, real quick.
[152:36.74]I mean, I'm down here already, might as well see, right?
[152:45.21]That's a place to go up.
[152:55.27]This might actually wrap back the other way, right?
[152:58.11]Possibly.
[153:00.99]What just hit me?
[153:01.45]Oh, something was in the rock.
[153:07.22]Okay.
[153:14.21]Nothing else.
[153:25.62]Still going up.
[153:31.25]Yeah.
[153:32.69]Huh.
[153:36.47]Um... Shit.
[153:47.38]It's okay.
[153:49.18]I got at least enough.
[153:50.09]At least a little bit.
[154:05.26]It just goes up and up and up.
[154:07.14]It never ends.
[154:18.75]I really hope I can connect over here somewhere.
[154:21.12]It would be real sad if I can't connect up there.
[154:32.15]Right here, right?
[154:36.30]Oh, I'm so close.
[154:37.22]I don't even know what this is doing, but close to something.
[154:40.28]New enemy, too.
[154:41.68]Failed tramway.
[154:42.76]This is a new area.
[154:51.60]Okay.
[154:54.40]We are back here.
[154:55.22]Did I open this?
[154:56.26]I don't remember doing that.
[155:06.14]This is just a complicated Excel spreadsheet.
[155:12.22]That's pretty accurate, actually.
[155:21.96]We're gonna go down.
[155:23.70]Yeah.
[155:24.40]Like this.
[155:27.56]Holy cannoli, this map is big.
[155:29.26]It really is.
[155:30.35]This is huge.
[155:39.90]Let me take a look.
[155:43.17]Can't open that.
[155:49.33]What about down here?
[155:54.00]Just curious.
[155:58.86]Another zone.
[155:59.84]Another spot.
[156:01.80]Should I drop down that?
[156:02.64]I don't think.
[156:04.95]I don't think I want to do this right now.
[156:06.21]I don't think I can get back up.
[156:14.11]Faded tramway.
[156:18.77]Should I drop down here?
[156:19.65]Let's see.
[156:29.31]Well, I did it.
[156:29.79]Oh, shit.
[156:34.87]These things are all going to come alive.
[156:36.11]This guy dropped a lot of money.
[156:51.09]Oh, here's where I get my cash.
[156:52.29]Alright.
[157:12.66]Hello?
[157:16.06]Who's talking down here?
[157:22.39]Oh, it's this guy again.
[157:23.47]I remember this guy.
[157:26.91]The mean guy.
[157:27.55]This is the mad guy.
[157:29.72]What are you doing?
[157:30.46]You clumsy little oaf swinging your little nail at me.
[157:32.80]You almost struck me.
[157:34.44]And if you had, it would have been the end of you.
[157:36.20]Trust me.
[157:36.68]Is that what the mighty... Does this guy's quest line have an end somewhere?
[157:50.43]only travel alone yeah yeah yeah so the kingdom was hiding this dark mess full of deadly predators well now the deadliest predator of all is here alright more I guess someone's blinking over here what is this king's idol
[158:18.59]That's having some trouble.
[158:23.38]If this doesn't end with me dying, why do you want me to die down here so bad?
[158:27.54]I want to progress.
[158:28.48]I've got to be careful down here.
[158:29.82]I don't want to die down here.
[158:35.92]This place is kind of a mess, though.
[158:37.90]Going down would connect me to there.
[158:41.15]I don't really want to do that, so let's go back up.
[158:56.03]Okay.
[159:03.11]He's gonna die down here.
[159:04.68]Let's go sit on the bench again and take a look at where I want to go.
[159:19.88]So I can go try to fight that boss over there, which I feel like I should do that.
[159:27.12]Yeah, we'll do that.
[159:27.76]We'll just see if I can do anything about it.
[159:35.94]So it's just straight across.
[159:41.53]When's the Breath of the Wild stream?
[159:43.21]When I don't have a Nintendo Wii.
[159:47.45]Whatever the fucking thing's called.
[159:50.82]I don't have any... Yeah, I can't play Breath of the Wild.
[159:52.40]I don't have a Nintendo Wii.
[159:53.52]Actually, that's not even true.
[159:54.36]They have Breath of the Wild for the Wii U, don't they?
[160:01.25]I fucking hate those little things.
[160:03.67]I do.
[160:04.21]I hate them.
[160:10.54]Up, up, up.
[160:16.34]Just buy it on Wii U?
[160:17.45]I can't do that.
[160:19.85]Buying it on the Wii U?
[160:21.49]No.
[160:23.93]You gotta get it on the Switch, man.
[160:32.56]I really thought he was going to be dead.
[160:35.06]The Nintendo NX.
[160:38.38]The one on Wii U runs well.
[160:39.66]Does it really?
[160:41.69]That's very surprising, considering that they've been working on that game for that long.
[160:50.91]Can I even get the fuck back up here?
[160:52.47]Yeah.
[160:55.55]Alright, where's that little asshole dumb boss thing?
[161:00.35]It's up here, right?
[161:06.53]Where was it?
[161:09.97]Okay, it was over here.
[161:10.75]Alright, here we go!
[161:15.31]Here.
[161:20.00]We.
[161:20.50]Go.
[161:21.82]Three, two, one, action.
[161:27.86]The corpse of mossy vagabond overcome with infection.
[161:34.49]The corpse of a mossy vagabond overcome with infection.
[161:36.57]Of course, the corpse of a mag... Yeah, okay.
[161:40.93]So, he's gonna come alive here in a second, isn't he?
[161:46.69]Or is he?
[161:51.59]Apparently not.
[161:57.28]Maybe on the way out?
[161:58.46]Wait, what?! !
[162:03.88]Light.
[162:08.10]Blazing bright.
[162:12.40]Bright.
[162:15.25]Light.
[162:17.73]Okay!
[162:21.67]Well, that was... That was a pretty easy boss fight.
[162:24.59]I beat him.
[162:25.23]I win.
[162:26.13]Wait, what?
[162:33.24]So that's not a boss.
[162:37.48]Unless that becomes a boss later and I have to do something specific or... I don't know.
[162:42.10]I didn't get hit one time, though.
[162:43.02]That's true.
[162:45.24]Um... Back into Deepnest.
[162:59.04]So... With that being the case...
[163:05.52]There's the tram.
[163:07.46]There's the area down the bottom right.
[163:11.99]Are we doing what we got?
[163:12.69]Should I go towards the tram or should I go to the bottom right?
[163:19.63]I guess we're gonna go to the tram.
[163:30.17]Hold on a second.
[163:32.39]Hold on a second.
[163:32.91]Important.
[163:33.71]We gotta... This is important.
[163:36.18]We're gonna be a fucking conga line.
[163:40.16]We're gonna be a conga line here.
[163:44.74]Somebody's gave a hundred bucks.
[163:47.06]There they are.
[163:52.78]I can't wait to add audio to this.
[163:54.20]It's gonna be fucking awesome.
[163:56.66]Thank you, Spoy.
[163:58.87]Spoychem.
[164:00.31]Spoychemical.
[164:01.69]Spoychem.
[164:02.91]I'm not sure how you pronounce your name, but thank you for the hundred bucks.
[164:05.55]That's a lot of fucking money, and they say... In the words of Tobuscus.
[164:12.15]Hello, once again, audience.
[164:14.81]Well, thank you.
[164:16.15]Thank you, Spoy.
[164:17.44]Also, thank you to Magpie.
[164:18.72]He gave five bucks earlier, like 15, 20 minutes ago.
[164:22.43]Congrats on the 2 million views.
[164:23.53]Oh, I got 2 million views.
[164:24.41]Cool.
[164:24.97]That's pretty sweet.
[164:27.56]But, thank you so much for the 100 fucking dollars.
[164:34.78]That's cash.
[164:35.86]That's real money.
[164:37.36]And it was just dropped.
[164:39.24]You rock.
[164:41.44]But, yes.
[164:43.28]This one's for you.
[164:44.72]When I get to the boss, it's gonna be for you.
[164:49.31]I'm gonna lose in three hits.
[164:55.29]Down left.
[165:01.09]How fast can I just damage boost my way through this shithole?
[165:08.73]Apparently, it's not that fast.
[165:12.43]But I gotta be careful here.
[165:14.31]Don't be that much of an idiot.
[165:22.45]This can't break.
[165:23.19]I wish it could.
[165:25.55]Let's go to the bench.
[165:26.39]Sit on the bench.
[165:28.53]Think about our lives for a little while.
[165:33.65]And let's go on the train.
[165:42.68]This way.
[165:48.47]This is going left this way.
[165:50.65]These weird bugs failed tramway.
[165:52.85]Because I came up from there.
[165:57.97]Alright.
[166:02.41]New spot.
[166:04.07]Interesting.
[166:04.61]Let's check this area.
[166:07.41]Burn it.
[166:07.89]Yeah, cheese it.
[166:12.22]Oh no.
[166:15.24]How can you guys still exist when there's like fucking concrete in here?
[166:20.87]That's such bullshit.
[166:21.97]You guys can't come through concrete.
[166:30.20]Don't know what that opened.
[166:33.30]Did that turn the train back on or something?
[166:39.17]Let's go back up here for a minute.
[166:48.01]We can go up.
[166:49.37]Secret!
[166:51.15]And here is... two soul hearts.
[166:56.84]Nice.
[166:58.28]Probably going to need those very shortly here.
[167:10.18]Oh, come on.
[167:14.63]I think I've been hit by these little roly-poly enemies more than any enemy in the whole game.
[167:20.95]And they're just so stupidly easy.
[167:33.70]Oh, God.
[167:36.64]Oh, God.
[167:37.20]Hold on.
[167:37.94]He just made another Biakonga line.
[167:43.32]Another Byakonga line showed up here.
[167:47.54]There they are again.
[167:53.62]Spoikim.
[167:54.36]Again, a hundred bucks.
[167:58.64]Thank you so much, man.
[168:01.81]Let's see what he says.
[168:02.45]Yeah, that is me in a clown car.
[168:05.79]That is me in the clown car.
[168:09.08]So, Spoi, I hope I'm really Jerma.
[168:11.40]My girlfriend broke up with me last month and your streams have helped me out a lot, even if I'm just a lurker.
[168:16.78]Well, I'm sorry to hear that, dude.
[168:20.31]Hopefully you can feel better about it.
[168:24.35]I'm pretty sure everybody in this chat or a lot of us can relate to that.
[168:29.71]If I can help you out, if I can make you laugh, if I can make you just chill and just hang out here, then I'm fucking so happy about that, man.
[168:42.69]200 bucks.
[168:46.29]You are too kind.
[168:49.05]Not a lurker no more.
[168:50.93]That's true, not a lurker no more.
[169:01.54]Can't get the feeling of getting dumped if you don't ever have a girlfriend.
[169:06.98]I mean, that's true, but...
[169:10.21]It don't matter, whatever it is.
[169:13.17]Trampass.
[169:17.45]I can actually turn the train on now?
[169:20.38]Over on the right side?
[169:21.36]Wasn't there a train somewhere else?
[169:28.74]There was a train somewhere else, wasn't there?
[169:33.72]I'm starting to get a fucking headache.
[169:35.71]Ugh, why?
[169:43.93]let's read the description somebody says a lifetime pass to the tramways connecting parts of hollowness these passes cost a huge amount of geo and each purchase required authorization by the king alright oh oh my god my head is killing me I don't know why
[170:12.87]Oh!

[170:36.13]Well, hey, you are welcome here, man.

[173:34.07]We all do that when we eat?
[173:34.95]Yeah, but like, we all do that when we eat because we're all very private eaters, right?
[173:40.37]I'm a private eater.
[173:46.14]How do I feel about people making their discords 18 plus and sub only?
[173:50.89]Yeah.
[173:52.57]I mean, people can do whatever they want.
[173:53.75]I mean, that's, like, I guess a perk for subbing and it's another reason to stay subscribed and that type of shit, but... I don't know.
[174:01.28]As long as you're just not a fucking idiot.
[174:02.94]Like, don't, like... I mean, it happens.
[174:04.88]People come in there and they're just like...
[174:08.16]Act like fucking sociopaths.
[174:10.86]You're just gonna get, like, banned.
[174:12.98]But, like, just... I don't ever want to have to close that shit down.
[174:15.94]Because I want that to be open.
[174:17.18]And I want that to be public for everybody.
[174:20.66]So where the fuck am I going?
[174:21.86]Ancient Basin?
[174:22.42]Down to the lower right?
[174:23.76]I think so, right?
[174:25.30]I believe I have to go down where that tram is.
[174:29.87]If I was not an idiot, I would be down lower right.
[174:37.72]Yeah.
[174:37.90]And there's another train right there.
[174:41.68]The tram goes that way.
[174:48.71]I mean, if I was a train, that's where I would be.
[174:50.95]Or I could go that way, to the left.
[174:56.97]I guess we could try that first.
[175:03.27]We're already here.
[175:07.81]My head is starting to scream.
[175:13.80]Hold on.
[175:24.12]I'm currently closing my eyes and pushing on my nose.
[175:30.39]Alright, so is there a... Shit.
[175:31.23]Shit.
[175:39.32]So if I go to the left, lower left, is that somewhere where I need to be?
[175:42.44]Or no, not yet.
[175:46.85]Or should I just get on the train?
[175:48.25]Ow.
[176:05.14]Yeah, sorry guys.
[176:05.88]I'm just taking a second.
[176:11.70]Ugh.
[176:13.50]Yeah, I get these from time to time.
[176:14.70]It's just my sleep schedule is just so fucked up right now.
[176:18.10]And, like, I'm in all sorts of, like... Fight the boss.
[176:22.18]Where's the boss?
[176:22.94]I don't even, like... My, like, headache right now is making me forget, like, basic human functions.
[176:27.31]Like, breathing.
[176:28.65]Like, I forget how to breathe.
[176:31.47]Okay.
[176:32.15]There we go.
[176:38.69]No, I got, like, another, like, 20, 30 minutes in me.
[176:40.35]Don't worry.
[176:40.91]I'll be okay.
[176:43.01]But... I think I'm just gonna go ride the train.
[176:46.93]I don't want to fight like a boss right now.
[176:48.37]I don't think I want to do that at the moment.
[176:51.76]My energy for, like, my brain energy is kind of expending.
[176:58.06]Let's just go down.
[176:58.70]Let's go hop on the train.
[177:00.12]I'm assuming that's what's down there.
[177:09.54]Don't worry, maybe not.
[177:10.64]Yeah, down, down, down.
[177:11.54]I'm gonna go take the tea.
[177:23.18]Ugh.
[177:26.39]Boss gift stuff.
[177:27.13]Yeah, I'll kill him later.
[177:28.25]We'll do that tomorrow.
[177:30.89]This is really starting to, for some reason, creep up on me bad right now.
[177:38.29]And it's really actually irritating me.
[177:40.01]I'm really annoyed.
[177:45.72]Don't push it.
[177:46.32]Oh, no.
[177:46.74]I'm totally fine.
[177:47.82]Don't worry.
[177:48.46]Don't worry, Spencer.
[177:49.06]I'm good to go.
[177:52.78]Streamers gotta do a better job thinking about their health.
[177:54.69]No, I... I get headaches all the time.
[177:57.53]Trust me.
[177:57.85]This is my first rodeo, you know?
[178:01.47]But I do appreciate it.
[178:08.31]Do it or ban.
[178:17.63]Wish this place wasn't like a giant maze, though.
[178:19.83]That's the other issue.
[178:20.71]Just trying to find the correct path.
[178:30.91]I hope this is the train.
[178:33.43]Vote ban.
[178:35.85]No, don't vote ban me.
[178:41.47]We have sub badges now?
[178:42.33]Yes, there are new sub badges.
[178:43.85]There's also new emotes.
[178:46.71]And some new animations, and some new stuff, and some new stuff, and some new stuff.
[178:51.21]And some new stuff.
[178:52.51]What the fuck?
[178:55.20]That was not fair.
[178:56.84]That was not fair because I forgot it was there.
[178:59.68]Here we go.
[179:01.52]Perfect.
[179:03.34]Well, here's this guy again.
[179:04.98]What a thrill.
[179:08.64]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[179:09.70]Deep.
[179:10.04]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[179:13.44]Where's Jerma's zap?
[179:15.98]Ah, fuck.
[179:16.51]I gotta put this in.
[179:17.23]Yeah, you're right.
[179:20.71]You're right.
[179:21.13]And when you're right, you're right.
[179:22.15]And you're right.
[179:25.67]So, there's the train.
[179:26.61]Let's try to ride it and see if we can get to a spot where I can call it for tonight.
[179:36.40]He's gonna keep going this way.
[179:37.84]Let's see what this does.
[179:40.28]I'm gonna try and do a wall.
[179:45.33]I'm just gonna damage this.
[179:52.75]Oh god.
[179:52.93]Oh god.
[179:53.21]Did another hundred dollars just come in here?
[179:57.35]A hundred bucks just came in again.
[180:00.67]Holy shit.
[180:01.63]Hold on.
[180:02.33]I need to get to a place where I can read this.
[180:07.52]I'm gonna, like, die.
[180:08.16]I'm gonna die here.
[180:08.94]I'm stuck in him.
[180:09.60]Oh.
[180:14.60]This way, right?
[180:15.22]Yep.
[180:17.83]Kind of?
[180:18.29]No?
[180:18.43]Over there.
[180:27.79]Down to the right.
[180:31.75]Don't make this easy, do they?
[180:33.91]There you go.
[180:36.16]Alright, so that was SpoiCam again with another $100.
[180:42.97]And he says, at DubskiDude, he says, I did.
[180:46.53]He says, I did.
[180:47.99]Jesus, dude.
[180:53.48]That's so much money.
[180:55.86]The last few streams, there's been a lot of fucking money.
[181:02.69]A couple people each one of these streams the last, like, week have dropped, like, hundreds of dollars, guys.
[181:08.71]That... I never know what to fucking say.
[181:14.82]He did.
[181:15.22]He did indeed.
[181:19.28]Literally a hundred dollar joke.
[181:23.24]Why have I not bought a better Elgato?
[181:28.72]Well, Spoy, that's a... That's a... That's cash.
[181:35.66]PC build stream.
[181:38.09]I still have to do that.
[181:41.43]But thank you.
[181:45.17]No amount of money will ever change the fact that
[181:50.20]You guys are fucking awesome.
[181:52.06]I like do this because I like to do this.
[181:55.14]And I like to hang out here.
[181:56.44]And I like to stream.
[181:59.86]And I like to make videos.
[182:02.39]That's why I do this.
[182:06.63]I do it because we're a giant goddamn family.
[182:11.69]This is a family for crying out loud.
[182:13.63]We're a family.
[182:16.67]Now eat your broccoli.
[182:21.09]And don't feed it to the dog like you did last time.
[182:23.39]I know.
[182:23.87]I can see it.
[182:28.86]But anytime something like this happens, it's just... You just never know what to say.
[182:37.34]You guys are fucking great.
[182:39.58]All of you.
[182:42.85]Buy 1,600 gumballs.
[182:46.93]And also, on top of that, like, not just Spoykem tonight, but there's been other people as well.
[182:52.53]I mean, this Luna... Luna just came in with 10 bucks.
[182:58.09]Says, if you read this, it'll be worth all the money.
[182:59.91]Well, thank you, Luna.
[183:02.39]Luna Zabuko, I believe is their full name.
[183:05.21]Jokes on you, I am broccoli.
[183:10.11]Ugh.
[183:12.29]This is worth any $400 joke ever, but I still want my $400 joke, please.
[183:17.77]Oh, no.
[183:18.71]He's asking for a $400 joke.
[183:21.82]Oh, shit.
[183:22.34]I'm on the spot.
[183:23.36]I better make this good.
[183:26.80]Oh, no.
[183:27.16]$400 joke.
[183:28.44]Okay.
[183:28.54]I'm going to do my best.
[183:29.72]I promise you I'm going to do my best.
[183:42.66]Uhh... What's this?
[183:46.40]Press the glowing... Wait, is this a seat?
[183:48.61]Oh, it's a rest stop.
[183:49.35]Okay.
[183:50.69]Press the glowing button.
[183:55.35]Okay, hold on.
[183:55.81]$400 joke.
[183:56.43]Quick, quick!
[184:00.71]Come on!
[184:04.47]Come on!
[184:06.87]It's your $400 joke!
[184:26.52]How do I get off the train?
[184:30.10]How do I get off the train?
[184:33.42]I don't know how to get off the train!
[184:38.89]Do I leave the- how do I exit?
[184:43.65]I'm just breaking shit, no, I don't know how to leave.
[184:48.19]How do I get off?
[184:53.60]Does anybody know how to leave?
[184:58.74]Looks like I'm never getting off the train.
[185:01.03]Oh, there it is.
[185:01.61]Okay.
[185:02.79]I gotta go this way.
[185:04.25]I'm gonna ride the train a little more.
[185:05.51]Make it stop.
[185:11.25]Alright, fine.
[185:12.20]Fine.
[185:12.64]Fine.
[185:17.70]Fine.
[185:36.38]This theme song sucks.
[185:41.11]Thomas the Tankin's theme song is fucking awful.
[185:47.89]No, we need a better song than that.
[185:52.43]Uh... That song sucks.
[186:02.28]Why is this?
[186:03.26]Why am I searching this?
[186:19.73]What does this have to do with a train?
[186:23.33]What does this have to do with a train?
[186:29.32]Ah, my fucking head.
[186:30.38]I don't know what that has to do with trains.
[186:38.78]I don't understand why it did that.
[186:45.78]Alright, there it goes.
[186:48.61]Where am I going?
[186:51.11]Did I just Google train zone?
[186:54.61]Kind of.
[186:59.33]$400 headache.
[187:00.04]Yeah, now it's worse.
[187:02.24]Hold on.
[187:10.28]Give me one more second.
[187:18.57]What is this?
[187:22.69]Alright, this name of this video is just called $400.
[187:25.33]No, I'm not clicking that fucking video.
[187:35.28]I missed a breakable wall.
[187:36.36]I missed a couple of things there.
[187:39.61]But thank you to Stix.
[187:42.27]Stix and Luna both gave 15 bucks and 16 bucks.
[187:47.61]Thomas the Dank Engine is best theme song.
[187:49.97]You take that back.
[187:52.99]And Luna says, it's a good $400 joke.
[187:56.95]Oh, I'm going to have to take a... I'm going to find a seat so I can take a break here and be done.
[188:04.99]I've got to find a little seat here.
[188:10.87]I don't want to die down here.
[188:11.95]I don't want to die down here.
[188:13.25]I'm just falling forever.
[188:16.55]Thank God.
[188:19.69]Um... Yeah, I'm just... I gotta... That last stupid fucking sneeze video, like, just made me have to stop.
[188:31.49]There was a seat on the train, so I'm good.
[188:35.42]Oh, yeah, I gotta call it a night here, unfortunately.
[188:38.78]Just after three hours, three hours and ten minutes or so.
[188:43.15]This, my headache is starting to get to me a little.
[188:45.59]I don't know why this started to happen.
[188:46.95]It's probably because my sleep schedule is so fucked up.
[188:50.93]Oh.
[188:55.17]Oh, I want a stream longer.
[188:57.20]Ow.
[189:02.30]I'm just going to pause it so I can read this last message here.
[189:07.22]Dedo gave $25.
[189:08.63]It says, here's a sappy message.
[189:10.91]I've been really depressed recently and you've made everything a lot better, so thank you so much.
[189:15.01]Well, thank you, Dedo.
[189:17.21]Thank you for being here.
[189:18.87]Thank you for participating in this community.
[189:21.63]Because that's what it is.
[189:23.93]It's a community.
[189:26.02]And guys, if you're looking for someone, like I said, I'm going to shout out the Discord again.
[189:33.82]Nothing makes me happier than going into that Discord and seeing people like playing games and talking and going into the voice channels and shit.
[189:39.82]That makes me so fucking happy.
[189:41.12]It really does.
[189:42.90]So if I can help you with like anything like that, any form of depression, any form of how bad you feel on a certain day, then I did what I wanted to do.
[189:52.62]I did what I sought to do in the first place.
[189:57.66]But thank you, Ditto.
[189:59.40]And thank you, everybody.
[190:02.24]When's the Jerma dating app?
[190:07.36]But I'm going to call it here.
[190:08.30]I'm going to just... I saved it like two seconds ago right before coming up here.
[190:14.01]We'll see how I feel tomorrow about continuing this.
[190:18.09]I don't know.
[190:18.37]Today was a very frustrating stream.
[190:20.77]Not because the guy don't like... Not the game and nothing to do with you guys.
[190:25.89]I've just been... It was a pretty salty stream.
[190:29.45]And I do apologize for that.
[190:31.79]I apologize for it.
[190:32.89]I just don't like to get that way, but sometimes you get angry at video games.
[190:37.71]But... Have a good night, guys.
[190:41.29]I'll see you guys tomorrow, same time.
[190:44.65]Somewhere around 7 o'clock, hopefully.
[190:47.60]And I'll catch you guys later.
[190:49.42]I'm gonna go drink some water, eat some chicken, and go rest up.
[190:53.08]So, have a good night.
[190:54.36]Take care, everybody.
[190:55.32]See you tomorrow.
[191:07.98]you
[191:42.92]you
