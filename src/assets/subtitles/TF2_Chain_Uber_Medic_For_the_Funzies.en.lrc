[00:06.96]Hey, what's happening everybody?
[00:09.74]Jerm right here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:13.28]And tonight, gonna be playing as the Chain Uber Medic tonight.
[00:17.73]Haven't done a Medic video in quite a long time, so I figured why not just come out with a fun video if you don't know what this is.
[00:25.35]Essentially, it's infinite invincibility.
[00:28.53]It's having an uber charge for more than 15 seconds, sometimes even as long as two minutes with an uber.
[00:35.22]It's definitely a whole lot of fun, but I recommend you don't do this all the time, because it totally is just trolling.
[00:41.67]You're pretty much just trolling the other team hardcore.
[00:45.33]And as you will see later on in this video, it's actually pretty easy to break up.
[00:49.32]You just need a pretty good pyro to kind of blast you around, but you'll see that later on.
[00:53.45]So how do you actually pull this off?
[00:56.21]You need two medics, obviously.
[00:58.39]Both of you need to be in some type of chat program, at least in direct communication with each other.
[01:03.79]You both need the Ubersaw, and you both need the regular default Medi Gun.
[01:08.15]So what you end up doing is hitting somebody on the enemy team four times with an Ubersaw, because that's all it takes.
[01:14.83]Then you uber your friend.
[01:16.51]Your friend is going to get four hits.
[01:18.41]Transfer it back to you.
[01:19.77]You're going to get four hits.
[01:20.93]Transfer it back to him.
[01:22.23]So on and so forth.
[01:23.66]And you just keep going until you can't go anymore.
[01:26.26]And it's actually quite surprising that Valve hasn't done anything about this.
[01:30.58]You would think that they would do some type of patch or something like that that didn't allow more than four or five Ubers to go in a row from the same medic within a minute or so.
[01:39.24]I have no idea.
[01:39.84]There's probably some way to fix this.
[01:42.06]So as you can tell on the screen, we are absolutely spawn-trapping them right now, which I felt kind of bad about.
[01:48.48]You always feel bad about this type of thing, but it's pretty funny at the same time.
[01:52.46]So I'm playing with MLC_St3alth right now.
[01:55.12]MLC_St3alth is a big Call of Duty guy, good friend of mine.
[01:58.11]We were just messing around in the chat, we decided to do this, and the next clip is actually very, very funny.
[02:03.95]Me and Stealth end up going as medic spies.
[02:06.61]That doesn't make any sense right now, but it will in a few minutes, I promise.
[02:11.91]So I get myself killed right here.
[02:13.31]Probably shouldn't be doing this.
[02:15.19]I had like 70% uber.
[02:16.63]I could have just ran backwards, found stealth, and we could have done it all over again, but I didn't do that.
[02:22.14]Got myself killed, but here is the second clip.
[02:25.38]This is actually pretty funny.
[02:26.43]They uber at the same time, so we go, okay, let's just keep going.
[02:29.97]We make our way through the tunnel here, see an engineer on the left.
[02:32.61]I start smashing him in the face.
[02:34.51]I always feel bad about stuff like this, because I think he might have been free to play.
[02:37.99]And he probably had no idea what was going on right there.
[02:41.62]Just like, oh, let me drop my sentry.
[02:43.60]What the hell is this?
[02:45.42]What just happened?
[02:46.24]And then he's just dead.
[02:47.16]And it's like, I'm sorry, there was some crazy guy in blue goo attacking you.
[02:51.54]So this is where it gets a little interesting.
[02:52.96]Me and Stealth, I say over chat, I'm going, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
[02:55.74]Sit right here for a second.
[02:57.16]Let's be medic spies and watch this.
[02:59.12]Backstab.
[03:00.15]Backstab!
[03:01.40]Backstab!
[03:02.62]We end up killing two people being medic spies and we still stick around and we're still alive.
[03:07.90]Get this sniper as well and then it's time to start the chain again.
[03:11.92]Probably shouldn't have done that right there because it was just one sniper and now look stealth is just smacking at the gate.
[03:18.79]So remember in the beginning when I said a good pyro can really ruin this for you?
[03:22.70]Take a look right here, I get the charge.
[03:24.94]And every time I go for it, I just keep getting compressed backwards.
[03:28.16]This is what you have to do to stop this from happening.
[03:30.82]And it works out pretty well for him because we have to retreat back into the tunnel and I end up getting the kill on him with the Blutsauger.
[03:36.95]Because that tunnel is really small, you can't really dodge or weave or anything like that.
[03:41.16]So it works out pretty well in our favor that time, and we end up staying alive.
[03:44.94]Kill that engineer, that was pretty gruesome.
[03:47.30]We were just both sticking on knives into his face.
[03:50.54]So now we're back at square one, playing as medic spies again.
[03:54.62]And take a look, that same pyro comes out, and it's like, nope, not gonna go for him.
[03:57.65]I'm not gonna go after that guy.
[03:59.83]Just chilling out here, waiting for someone that's not a pyro to open that door, and eventually a medic comes out, and I get him with the medic backstab.
[04:07.43]One, two, three backstabs is all it takes.
[04:11.79]So we just barely get the charge off on that Heavy, get the kill on him, and now we're looking for somebody else.
[04:16.61]No one else is really around, so he runs down this way towards the cart.
[04:20.10]And look who shows up to ruin the fun, the Pyro again.
[04:23.24]He does his job, but we had some miraculous rescue from another Pyro.
[04:26.83]I don't even know how that guy got back here.
[04:28.75]But he ends up saving the day nonetheless.
[04:31.73]So anyways, this is going to be the end of the video.
[04:34.07]We end up getting ourselves killed by a Pyro.
[04:36.37]Thank you all so much for watching.
[04:37.83]I really do appreciate it.
[04:39.07]Just wanted to put this video together showing some quick, goofy little shenanigans as the Chain Uber Medic.
[04:44.73]But yeah, thanks guys.
[04:45.69]I will see you all next time.
[04:46.93]And take care, everybody.
