[ve:60.16.100]

[00:39.57]Alright, so I just pulled up Twitter.
[00:45.59]Let's wait for a minute.
[00:48.41]I must have been really angry this afternoon.
[00:50.96]I guess I do remember writing this.
[00:55.70]Give me a second.
[00:56.56]I'll talk about it.
[00:57.10]I'll see you in a minute.
[01:23.51]Hey, what's the commotion?
[01:24.41]I told you guys.
[01:25.98]I told you guys last night I was gonna be streaming today.
[01:30.08]I told you like around, I don't know, like 11, 12, 1, somewhere like the early afternoon is when I was gonna start streaming.
[01:37.13]Oh, maybe you guys weren't here.
[01:38.37]Hey!
[01:39.75]What's up, guys?
[01:41.02]Hey, what's up, dude?
[01:43.40]So I opened up a Twitter.
[01:44.90]I'm about to write a tweet to tell everybody that I'm live streaming.
[01:48.88]And apparently I wrote this tweet earlier.
[01:51.92]I didn't press send.
[01:52.92]I think for some reason maybe I rolled back over and went to sleep or something like that.
[01:56.16]But here's the tweet.
[01:58.04]YouTube currently, I guess, is doing a thing called YouTube Taught Me.
[02:02.53]YouTube's trying to do their own reverse smear campaign where everybody's talking shit about YouTube and then all of a sudden it's like, oh wait, here's what YouTube taught me.
[02:12.67]I don't know what it's for.
[02:13.41]I think it's for like a... I think they're trying to like talk about how great YouTube is.
[02:17.87]Anyways, this is what I wrote.
[02:19.87]It's a hashtag.
[02:21.65]It says, hashtag YouTube taught me that putting a face cam on a children's Lego game could pay me more than a doctor.
[02:30.32]You think that's good enough?
[02:35.36]Is that a good tweet?
[02:40.23]send it good enough good bad band what that what did you don't like that one it is true back in like the youtube heyday
[03:08.71]Alright, well, I didn't send it.
[03:11.87]I must have been scared that YouTube would be like, hey, don't say that.
[03:15.35]I don't give a shit what people say about me.
[03:17.38]I don't care what people think.
[03:18.24]You know what I mean?
[03:19.46]I don't give a shit what people think about me.
[03:21.10]I say whatever I want.
[03:22.76]I don't make a tweet about YouTube.
[03:23.88]I don't care.
[03:26.08]You know, I don't care.
[03:27.38]I'll do whatever the fuck I want.
[03:33.83]Anyways, the EU-friendly stream today.
[03:38.40]We're doing a lot of streams.
[03:39.68]This is, I think, four or five days in a row now.
[03:47.57]Wanted to make up for last week not streaming at all.
[03:50.25]Because obviously I was with my mother for a lot of that time.
[03:57.79]And it's currently one o'clock in the afternoon.
[04:00.43]So maybe some of you EU boys and girls might be...
[04:05.11]The tweet that I replaced it with was... Just a link to my Twitch.
[04:10.37]No text.
[04:11.39]God damn it.
[04:11.93]Hold on.
[04:16.38]Uh, EU... Friendly.
[04:22.84]Livestream.
[04:24.88]I got nothing right now.
[04:27.94]EU friendly.
[04:32.90]Uh...
[04:36.94]How about EU-friendly EU simulator?
[04:41.44]No, you can't put simulator.
[04:42.74]That's so fucking dumb to death.
[04:47.21]How about just EU-friendly EU?
[04:51.15]I like that.
[04:51.61]EU-friendly EU.
[04:55.27]There you go.
[05:03.52]EU unfriendly.
[05:04.46]How is this EU unfriendly?
[05:06.90]This is very EU-friendly.
[05:12.66]Let's get that over where it belongs.
[05:16.18]And okay.
[05:18.67]Hey, look.
[05:19.77]Let's start where we left off.
[05:21.59]This is going to be the last time I stream this game in particular.
[05:26.99]After today... I mean, I don't know how... I don't have a time frame here.
[05:31.47]Maybe like a few hours.
[05:33.30]After this, you're not going to see Kingdom Come Deliverance ever again.
[05:37.35]is we're gonna put the cap on Kingdom Come, because even if there's still more to do, we might be talking about potentially another 70 to 80 hours of content that I have to do.
[05:48.88]And I don't think I want to keep doing it and keep playing it on stream, because there's a lot of other stuff we want to play.
[05:58.74]Jerma is sick of pretending to like the game.
[06:03.79]I have a love-hate relationship with this game.
[06:06.49]I equally hate it as much as I love it.
[06:11.76]I, like, really like this game.
[06:13.60]But I also fucking hate it.
[06:19.80]Anyways.
[06:22.78]Hate-hate relationship.
[06:26.91]Like, for every moment that I've been like, That was so cool!
[06:29.83]There's been a moment where I've wanted to, like, delete my computer.
[06:36.20]I got like a frog in my throat.
[06:37.28]Anyways, what was the last thing we did is I had a meltdown.
[06:40.81]And then... Oh, that's a denomination of time.
[06:47.79]Okay, I had a meltdown.
[06:49.21]And then I started the quest again.
[06:51.11]Okay, cool.
[06:54.83]So... What was the last thing I had to do?
[07:02.79]I don't even have any fucking quests.
[07:05.14]Oh, there it is.
[07:05.66]Okay.
[07:06.34]So this is where we... This is the Timmy at the windmill.
[07:13.16]So, this is... Show, where is it?
[07:15.55]I have to activate it.
[07:16.63]This is A. Alright, Timmy at the windmill.
[07:19.59]This is when I was an idiot and I hit the guy in the back with a horse.
[07:22.19]I need to go to sleep.
[07:23.15]Why did I... Why am I awake right... I thought I went right to bed at the end of the stream, didn't I?
[07:30.29]Did I dream up any new foods?
[07:32.05]No.
[07:32.73]Unfortunately, no.
[07:34.89]I did have a different dream.
[07:37.41]I don't know what the dream was.
[07:38.39]It's gone.
[07:43.77]I always tell myself that I'm gonna get a dream journal, because my dreams are insane.
[07:49.64]And they're not typically... I don't have, like, nightmares where terrible things... I mean, it happens.
[07:55.52]I have, like, some crazy nightmares dreams.
[07:59.00]That just make absolutely no sense, but recently my dreams have just been so dumb and weird.
[08:04.00]And I always tell myself I'm gonna get a dream journal and write this down because this is stupid but I kind of want to remember it.
[08:10.00]And then I never do it I never get the dream journal that I say I want to do because it's a pain in the ass.
[08:14.00]When you're really tired you're just waking up out of bed you don't want to like: Oh, I'm just getting up, I'm so groggy - where's the pen?
[08:20.00]And you like write an essay, nobody wants to do that.
[08:26.53]I guess you could just pick up your phone and be like, Siri, take a note.
[08:31.63]No, no.
[08:31.97]What's the note?
[08:33.54]Inside of a cave.
[08:36.62]Sharing two sticks with a guy, some homeless guy.
[08:40.56]Threw up in his mouth.
[08:42.50]Mickey Mouse comes in and drains all my battery from my iPod.
[08:48.31]I kiss him.
[08:49.53]Imagine listening to that later.
[08:50.93]You'd be like, what the fuck am I, drugs?
[08:57.75]I wouldn't be able to trust myself.
[08:59.39]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[09:05.39]Would you be able to trust your very tired self?
[09:08.79]These are all rotten.
[09:14.55]This ain't good.
[09:16.47]Cheese never goes bad.
[09:17.71]Why is cheese going bad?
[09:19.86]Carrots don't go bad either.
[09:24.32]I think that would be actually kind of funny.
[09:26.70]Imagine if I woke up from a dream and like started streaming into you guys with the dream journal.
[09:32.98]I just started doing it.
[09:33.84]I might want to do that one day.
[09:38.07]That would be fucking hilarious.
[09:39.67]Just like come down here wicked groggy and just turn it on and just call it dream journal.
[09:45.69]And just say it and then turn this dream off.
[09:50.42]Can I eat the ears?
[09:53.16]No.
[09:53.34]No.
[09:55.58]I mean, I can eat some fruit.
[09:57.00]I got dried meat.
[09:58.14]I'll be fine.
[10:05.09]65.
[10:05.53]Let's go to 70.
[10:08.25]Get it up there.
[10:10.43]You said you aren't functional six hours.
[10:12.33]I know.
[10:13.15]It's true.
[10:13.59]Extreme sleeping will take notes on your behavior.
[10:18.56]That's so fucked up.
[10:22.62]I would never want to do that.
[10:23.78]That is so terrifying.
[10:27.10]I wouldn't want anyone to see me sleeping.
[10:29.04]Oh, where's the horse?
[10:36.03]What does this horse have?
[10:40.13]Can I cook this shit?
[10:41.71]Can I dump... Hold on.
[10:44.71]Can I dump the hair into here?
[10:49.85]I can't put a bunch of hair in here.
[10:55.74]Oh well.
[10:56.80]I have to cook it over a fire.
[10:59.50]Let's go.
[11:03.93]Nobody wants to get watched sleeping.
[11:10.85]You know what I mean?
[11:12.20]Nobody wants that.
[11:15.04]Not even a person in a giant birdhouse.
[11:19.60]I'm good to go.
[11:20.08]Let's get the horse here.
[11:21.66]Wait, I think I can just... Can I fast travel to the mill?
[11:24.52]Did I find it yet?
[11:25.54]Yeah, let's go here.
[11:32.27]And I know there's been like streamers that have done it before, but man, I don't want you... I might take my pants off in the middle.
[11:39.29]You know what I mean?
[11:39.87]When you're asleep, you don't understand the things that you're doing.
[11:42.07]It's like being super drunk.
[11:45.74]I envision a scenario where I'm livestreaming, oh, sleep stream, I'm going to bed!
[11:50.96]And then four hours later, I'm in full REM sleep and I take off my fucking pants and underwear.
[11:57.35]Like, that might happen.
[12:05.02]Like, I envision a scenario where I take off my jeans and my shoes and you guys see it.
[12:22.15]I need to do a sleep study.
[12:30.09]I swear to God, I would do that.
[12:33.01]Or I would just, like, it would be embarrassing.
[12:35.80]Everybody does all kinds of weird, gross shit in their sleep.
[12:45.66]Why do you think people watch?
[12:47.30]Yeah, well, that's... I don't want to... Look, this is not a reality show.
[12:52.26]Okay?
[12:54.02]I don't want to turn my stream into, like, a reality TV show.
[12:58.31]What's he gonna do this time?
[12:59.51]Is he gonna fucking fart on camera in his sleep and, like, take his pants off?
[13:04.17]And then get in an argument with somebody?
[13:05.93]Oh, what's gonna happen next time?
[13:08.44]I don't really... I don't want to make my stream... And that's fine.
[13:11.56]If you think that... If you want to watch that, that's fucking cool.
[13:15.58]Because the new reality TV is, like, live streaming.
[13:23.28]And that's a completely new platform.
[13:28.25]Completely live reality TV.
[13:30.05]Because back before this, you used to have to watch The Bachelor to get your drama.
[13:36.31]Now imagine you can watch The Bachelor live, and you're inside The Bachelor's bedroom.
[13:41.27]Can you imagine how different some of those shows would be?
[13:44.75]If instead of edited video with a 100-person crew, we were just in The Bachelor's bedroom the whole time?
[13:55.15]That show turns really dark.
[13:57.87]If you add that.
[13:59.73]That turns these reality shows real fucking dark real quick.
[14:05.22]That's called porn.
[14:21.24]Does it?
[14:21.66]Yeah, because instead of it being like, who's the girl he's going to pick?
[14:26.35]The girls are going to fight in his bedroom.
[14:29.05]And then it's not going to be... Look, when people go on camera, they act differently.
[14:32.63]Like, right now, I'm acting different.
[14:34.97]I'm acting incredibly differently.
[14:37.53]In real life, oh, whoa, I'm a different... Wow, different, completely different person.
[14:43.06]When something happens, when a camera turns on, something happens.
[14:47.08]And you just act differently.
[14:48.44]When people don't know that a camera's always pointed at them, like a... Most reality shows are just scripted.
[15:07.38]They're all manufactured fake drama.
[15:11.50]But on the new reality show, which is like Twitch and YouTube Live, you get real reality drama.
[15:20.76]Alright, I need to talk to this person, right?
[15:23.76]I'm looking for a Colossus by the name of Timmy.
[15:26.27]I heard he works here.
[15:27.89]I don't know anyone like that.
[15:32.48]No, we did this right.
[15:33.22]We threatened.
[15:33.64]This is the real reality.
[15:35.22]Acting.
[15:35.62]No, not my stream.
[15:36.32]Like when the cameras turn on.
[15:37.92]Is when this happens.
[16:05.92]Like, when I set up a big camera, like for instance, we did the Dermarombo Live.
[16:10.44]That was a different person.
[16:13.35]That wasn't me.
[16:15.11]I was acting.
[16:15.61]A bunch of cameras turned on.
[16:18.21]It's like cinematographers and people behind the scenes.
[16:23.04]No, no.
[16:23.64]You put on just a webcam, that person is real.
[16:29.57]Save.
[16:30.21]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[16:31.33]That's a good idea.
[16:33.07]Fuck.
[16:34.16]Alright, I need to, like, buy a po- I'll meet her- No, I already saved.
[16:41.06]I'm good.
[16:43.64]I say- This is saved right before I came over here, so it's fine.
[16:48.27]I'll be alright.
[16:52.93]Describe this game in one sentence.
[16:55.09]Okay.
[16:56.99]Um...
[17:00.99]One sentence.
[17:01.53]How long can the sentence be?
[17:02.59]Alright, I'm gonna... I'm gonna say, in one sentence, the... the equivalent, grammatically, and lengthwise, that this game... I'll write it down.
[17:21.38]Here's my one sentence on this game.
[17:23.40]I'm gonna write it in chat.
[17:24.96]And remember, we're gonna use this... this is exact... this is the... you'll see.
[17:30.94]It's going to take a second.
[17:31.74]This is my review.
[17:35.65]Hold it to the same standards as this game.
[18:05.80]Wait, what?
[18:15.82]Wait, what?
[19:10.25]Okay.
[19:34.84]There it is.
[19:38.21]There's my final review on Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[19:52.28]Read that whole thing.
[19:57.74]Tweet it.
[20:00.14]Wait, where is it?
[20:00.88]What do you mean, where is it?
[20:02.45]What do you mean, where is it?
[20:03.55]What?
[20:03.95]What?
[20:04.19]What?
[20:04.37]What?
[20:04.55]What?
[20:04.71]What?
[20:04.89]What?
[20:05.05]Don't!
[20:05.25]Nobody talk!
[20:07.06]What do you mean it didn't show up?
[20:16.50]What are you talking about?
[20:17.32]I typed it and hit enter.
[20:20.16]Why does Twitch do this sometimes?
[20:21.74]Here.
[20:21.94]Do you see it?
[20:32.52]You still don't see it.
[20:34.91]I don't believe you.
[20:36.43]You don't see this.
[20:38.13]You don't see that.
[20:40.41]I just got timed out.
[20:42.45]No, I didn't.
[20:57.10]There's no joke.
[21:00.42]There it is.
[21:01.00]Good.
[21:01.34]You can see it.
[21:07.40]Did I meet her yet?
[21:09.48]Where is she?
[21:09.90]Alright, there she is.
[21:16.40]I personally can't see it.
[21:17.77]Wait a minute.
[21:19.25]Hold on.
[21:20.01]If you can't see it, then I get an idea.
[21:29.80]I'll put it on screen.
[21:30.50]You'll see.
[21:31.78]I'll put it really small on the screen.
[21:33.78]Refresh your Twitch page.
[21:34.98]This is not going to be worth it.
[21:36.92]I just... It should have been there.
[21:59.58]Here comes the bad guys, right?
[22:01.86]Okay, I can... You guys, we already saw this last night.
[22:11.11]There.
[22:17.57]That's not gonna work.
[22:18.81]This is not gonna work, guys.
[22:21.13]This is too... Alright, here's what I'm gonna do.
[22:23.77]Here's what I'm gonna do for you.
[22:24.83]I'm gonna slowly... We're gonna read the whole thing.
[22:27.60]Ready?
[22:27.82]Ready?
[22:30.28]Can I pause this?
[22:34.44]Wait, I'll go through, I'll drag it.
[22:37.33]Alright, here we go.
[22:39.73]Ladies and gentlemen, here is my review of Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[22:50.57]Wait, what?
[23:25.63]Oh, can I get this to do it?
[23:28.45]Wait a second.
[23:29.09]Hold on.
[23:32.44]I think I can do this.
[23:38.95]I can't make this fucking scroll?
[23:40.55]Oh, God.
[23:43.29]I hope you're reading this.
[24:15.22]Done.
[24:40.37]You have an encampment somewhere.
[24:42.79]I can't.
[24:43.09]I'll just attack.
[24:44.71]Wait, I have my new combat skills though.
[25:10.73]This is the point where I explain myself.
[25:15.09]The point was, it's a fucking mess.
[25:18.23]And I wrote a mess with like barely any punctuation and a bunch of spelling errors and a bunch of mistakes.
[25:23.51]And it's huge.
[25:24.45]It's way too long.
[25:26.78]But it sure was funny, wasn't it?
[25:29.42]Sure was fun to read.
[25:31.80]Huh.
[25:33.26]Makes you think, doesn't it?
[25:35.22]Huh.
[25:36.44]Makes you think, doesn't it?
[25:38.92]Alright, I'll tell you where he is.
[25:41.10]Really?
[25:42.92]Why would you do that?
[25:44.12]We're all Christians here, aren't we?
[25:46.40]Why not help my neighbor?
[25:48.27]Especially if he pays two score.
[25:49.81]You wouldn't be my cousin.
[25:53.29]Don't explain.
[25:54.55]I'll give you two dozen.
[25:55.95]No more.
[25:57.03]Half now and half when we find him.
[25:59.67]Deal.
[26:02.89]Alright, so there we go.
[26:05.21]He's at the Colburn's farm.
[26:07.44]He really activates those almonds.
[26:08.92]Okay.
[26:10.06]I'm gonna come with him.
[26:10.96]Pizzle equals yanked.
[26:32.42]Alright, let's go.
[26:33.02]Remember, I learned my new combat skills, so I'm not a piece of shit anymore.
[26:37.33]And I could tackle him, but I don't want to.
[26:38.79]Because I probably didn't learn the correct tackle move from Father Time, whatever his name is.
[26:45.57]Why are we running there?
[26:48.21]Wasn't there a third guy last night?
[26:50.81]Not this dude.
[26:51.65]Oh, there he is.
[26:59.84]Kill the one guy that follows you first.
[27:07.80]Hey, come on.
[27:08.46]Can we just do a little bit of roughhousing as friends?
[27:12.64]How many people used to wrestle?
[27:17.45]Why do we do that?
[27:18.91]What's with that?
[27:22.89]How come?
[27:24.31]It's a boys thing.
[27:25.55]You know what I mean?
[27:26.07]Like, hey, we're going to just wrestle around.
[27:28.63]Come here.
[27:28.93]No, I got you in a headlock.
[27:30.19]Get off me, dude.
[27:31.07]Like, you wrestle around.
[27:39.26]I don't want to punch him in the face, so bad.
[27:45.42]This is taking a lot to hold back, just not jab him right in his jaw.
[27:52.81]Do you have anything to try?
[27:53.61]Alright, let's see if he says the same thing.
[28:00.22]No, didn't say anything to that guy, did you?
[28:03.88]Let's do traffic jam on this guy.
[28:06.20]See, this is what happens on the highway.
[28:08.86]You got one fucking asshole going like 12 miles per hour in the left lane, and it causes this mess.
[28:17.80]And there's nowhere to go.
[28:18.72]Then this guy gets angry and goes around everybody and gets in an accident.
[28:27.38]How come these guys have really nice armor and weapons, but they don't have any horses?
[28:31.45]Why?
[28:35.27]No.
[28:35.73]I-90, am I right?
[28:42.32]Oh, I-90.
[28:42.68]Am I right?
[28:43.88]Ooh, bird shit.
[28:52.12]Tackle them all.
[28:52.92]No.
[28:54.80]They spent their money on armor.
[29:00.68]Well, this is a real long... I feel like we should talk about something.
[29:04.00]Carrots!
[29:05.42]Nope.
[29:09.92]You know, I-90 is so repeatable.
[29:11.98]I thought you said reputable for a second.
[29:17.00]I was like, yeah, I guess it is.
[29:18.60]Is it?
[29:25.70]Why am I looking at every pile of animal dung?
[29:34.72]Am I actually going to help them just kill Timmy?
[29:36.62]No, we're going to do the big reversal.
[29:40.37]The big reveal is I get paid.
[29:42.39]Because remember I said I'll pay you.
[29:44.54]Pay me and I'll show you.
[29:46.06]So I want the money.
[29:47.78]And then I'm going to protect Timmy.
[29:51.62]It's going to be unbelievable.
[30:00.31]God.
[30:02.65]God, the advent of the car.
[30:05.67]You know, the invention of the car, this is what people used to do.
[30:08.44]Look, that guy's even climbing over bushes and stuff.
[30:10.42]This is what people did.
[30:12.32]If you didn't have a horse.
[30:16.54]Back in the day, everyone did the equivalent of, like, cross-country in high school.
[30:25.65]This is what you did, like, if you had to go somewhere.
[30:27.99]Imagine you had to go to the store and you just had to jog there.
[30:31.35]Like this, everyone just didn't talk.
[30:33.93]You're just human cars.
[30:45.63]Why you guys have to do that?
[30:46.93]Alright, I'm gonna go.
[30:47.75]Let me show you guys something.
[30:49.14]Look at what I got.
[30:50.98]I've got a fucking old car.
[30:55.64]Hey.
[30:56.54]Smell you later.
[31:01.74]Wait, what?
[31:04.83]Why is it here?
[31:06.47]Why is it pointing right here?
[31:07.43]Is it right here?
[31:07.95]Is Timmy right here?
[31:14.29]Oh.
[31:16.44]I have to wait until he finds him.
[31:21.18]So I can't go rush to Timmy right now.
[31:26.88]Yes, I know what the guy's name is.
[31:31.46]Yes, his name is... His name is Morkik.
[31:34.34]I know.
[31:35.12]It's really... It's like a funny Easter egg.
[31:42.29]You can rush... Okay, I'm going to rush to Timmy.
[31:44.15]This is definitely where they're going.
[31:47.66]Tim, wake up.
[31:49.88]I'm gonna sit there.
[31:50.32]I'm gonna go in here with like a bow and arrow and just wait in the room.
[31:52.80]Timmy?
[31:54.16]Tim, there's guys that are coming to get you.
[31:56.68]Tim?
[31:58.26]Where's Tim?
[31:59.08]Tim?
[32:01.04]Hey, Timmy.
[32:02.44]How are you today?
[32:03.74]I'm alright.
[32:07.52]Tim, you gotta be careful.
[32:09.04]I'm here to save your life.
[32:12.56]Oh, shit.
[32:15.05]What do you want?
[32:16.65]It wasn't me.
[32:18.01]I didn't... I mean... Shit.
[32:21.03]Alright, that's pretty guilty.
[32:23.51]I saw what you did at Neuhof.
[32:25.73]What are you talking about?
[32:27.90]You weren't there.
[32:29.90]I mean... I wasn't there.
[32:32.16]They're coming to get you.
[32:33.24]Who said to... I did.
[32:36.22]I heard all about it.
[32:37.32]What do you want from me?
[32:39.52]Money.
[32:39.74]Your mate Hinnok told me about a whole camp full of those whoresons.
[32:43.43]No, you're not.
[32:43.83]Hmm.
[32:43.91]Okay, well... This guy doesn't look very strong.
[32:46.47]I mean, we got...
[33:11.34]We have 65 Jerma moons over there.
[33:13.70]I don't know what that means.
[33:14.62]I don't know.
[33:16.76]Is that money?
[33:17.66]No.
[33:19.56]Is that the amount of Jerma moons that have been in the chat in the last 60 seconds or something?
[33:26.14]I don't think I'm going to... He's dumb, though, right?
[33:28.92]Alright.
[33:33.88]I'm going to go speech here.
[33:36.52]That sounds like a plan.
[33:37.49]Why would I be trying to catch you out?
[33:38.77]I'm a secret agent.
[33:39.73]For Christ's sake, man.
[33:40.85]They crucified Limpy Lubos in Užice.
[33:43.39]What the hell are you trying to pull here?
[33:45.29]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[33:48.88]What will I do?
[33:50.50]Shit.
[33:51.44]I don't know where their camp is.
[33:53.60]That's a load of horse shit.
[33:55.40]Hinek told me you were there.
[33:56.86]God, that finger wag.
[33:57.92]They couldn't have thought of anything else besides a finger wag.
[34:00.55]Well, once I was there with them, yeah.
[34:03.87]Only, I was pretty drunk.
[34:06.35]So I'm not too sure.
[34:08.11]Try to remember.
[34:08.93]Oh, indeed.
[34:10.43]It was in the woods.
[34:12.55]In some kind of... One of those guys right behind me trying to kill him.
[34:15.79]You know, with trees and stuff.
[34:18.69]There were some wrecked houses there and all.
[34:22.19]In the woods.
[34:24.13]A church.
[34:25.07]There was a church there.
[34:27.09]Kind of a broken one, though.
[34:29.73]Oh, great.
[34:30.75]Thanks a lot.
[34:31.85]Now it's all clear to me.
[34:34.51]Do you remember which way you went?
[34:36.48]I just want like an arrow to hit him in the head from the guys that are behind me.
[34:42.12]I'm definitely going to turn this cutscene off.
[34:45.53]And he's going to get hit in the head with like an arrow.
[34:50.85]They're going to be right here.
[34:54.05]You come across this abandoned house.
[34:57.63]Can't miss it.
[34:58.89]Looks like a house.
[35:00.55]Only abandoned.
[35:02.23]Okay.
[35:02.63]Go to the left there and carry on until you come to this clearing.
[35:07.85]You find a big beech.
[35:09.13]Big beech tree.
[35:10.59]Or was it an oak?
[35:12.67]You go left there again.
[35:14.77]There's this narrow path.
[35:17.53]You could have sold them out.
[35:18.40]I did.
[35:19.64]They're behind me.
[35:21.24]Sometimes it splits up.
[35:23.22]You just keep to the left until you come to a crossroads by this big flat rock.
[35:30.28]You keep straight on there.
[35:33.34]After a while, you'll see a bridge.
[35:35.86]And it's right there.
[35:37.80]Easy as you please.
[35:39.33]Better than nothing, I suppose.
[35:40.55]Thanks.
[35:41.41]Thanks, Timmy.
[35:41.83]But you won't tell nobody about Neuhof, right?
[35:44.37]You promised.
[35:46.65]Oh, no.
[35:47.63]Bugger.
[35:48.97]I meant to make you promise.
[35:50.95]But I forgot.
[35:51.97]See, that's the problem, Tim.
[35:54.57]uh yeah let's let him have this I won't tell don't worry but in future we're gonna let him have this one little victory money like honest work thanks I'll try I mean the guy's the guy's dead in about 30 seconds so I'm not going at the windmill hi merca did you talk to her what did she say she told me you're as thick as a fence post and always getting dragged into some mischief did she
[36:24.22]Yeah, she's probably right.
[36:27.10]Mm-hmm.
[36:28.78]Right.
[36:29.64]You serious?
[36:38.87]Nice to see you, Timmy.
[36:41.67]I told you out.
[36:42.77]What?
[36:44.08]I haven't seen you around for a while.
[36:58.97]Shit!
[37:12.79]Caused a commotion!
[37:17.38]Now he'll get away.
[37:30.47]Alright, we got the information we needed.
[37:38.42]What was I trying to do?
[37:39.26]I was trying to cause chaos!
[37:41.18]And commotion!
[37:42.76]So Timmy wouldn't die, and then he would have a chance to move!
[37:46.89]They're all gonna run around, they're gonna be looking for me for like three hours.
[37:50.01]That gives Timmy a chance to back up his sleeping bag.
[37:58.66]And find another town to go to.
[38:00.42]See?
[38:00.94]He already found a new place to go.
[38:03.92]Already.
[38:06.44]See?
[38:07.92]There he is.
[38:10.64]The distraction was enough to get him out here.
[38:14.50]And now he's living a new life as a tiller.
[38:18.18]Whatever this is.
[38:23.33]By the way, Timmy.
[38:26.26]Don't you ever fucking fuck me over again.
[38:52.79]Come on, that was the same model.
[39:06.21]Timmy was short for Joseph.
[39:16.10]He had a title.
[39:18.96]Alright, let's go.
[39:19.66]I got keys.
[39:21.50]I got keys to something.
[39:28.39]Report to the location of bandit camp.
[39:31.37]Wait until... Wait, what?
[39:35.29]Hold on.
[39:38.13]I can just go back and do that.
[39:44.25]Huh?
[39:48.27]Go get your reward.
[39:53.75]Okay.
[40:04.82]Your reward!
[40:06.76]You're a tattlery one!
[40:09.90]Holy shit!
[40:10.86]It's Jasper!
[40:11.66]What was his name?
[40:13.60]Jafar!
[40:23.55]Um... Alright, where are they at?
[40:28.59]Right here?
[40:34.91]Wait, where are they?
[40:37.01]Why are they all the way up here?
[40:42.53]Whatever.
[40:42.81]I guess we're going to go that way.
[40:52.60]Oh, is this bait?
[40:54.08]Am I going to get attacked on sight here?
[41:02.43]Come on, you gotta give me a little bit of credit.
[41:03.89]Farmer Joseph had the same exact character model and the same clothes as Timmy.
[41:08.54]I guess they're up here.
[41:27.02]Alright, where you with at?
[41:29.16]I'd like my money, please.
[41:30.70]I told you that you would find him.
[41:34.08]I gave him a chance, that's all I can say I did.
[41:47.07]Timmy Joseph Tiller.
[41:50.13]Is this their camp or something?
[41:51.05]There they are, okay, there they are.
[41:53.71]Wait.
[41:55.49]Who is that?
[41:59.62]Why is he just walking by himself?
[42:00.80]Alright.
[42:07.39]He is just walking back.
[42:11.79]I can't talk to him.
[42:14.57]There's no talk.
[42:24.18]Why are you creeping around like a footbag?
[42:50.61]I couldn't talk to him.
[42:52.14]I'm gonna get my reward, that's for sure.
[43:03.42]Where's the sword?
[43:05.14]There's the sword.
[43:05.72]It's like a big cane.
[43:07.26]Soul slicer.
[43:08.22]Holy shit.
[43:09.24]This is like a rare item.
[43:14.32]What is this?
[43:24.65]Thank you for the new item.
[43:26.83]Appreciate it.
[43:27.85]It looks red.
[43:28.75]It glows.
[43:31.57]Sorry.
[43:34.00]It's got magical properties!
[43:35.28]Okay.
[43:42.24]Cool.
[43:43.06]Got my reward.
[43:49.84]You know, I tried to play that diplomatically.
[43:51.90]But the game wouldn't... I couldn't talk to him.
[43:53.78]That guy was stuck.
[43:55.00]That was a bugged quest.
[44:00.42]Yeah, don't you guys know how this works?
[44:02.53]It's just like in Harry Potter.
[44:05.81]I had to slide to get some of his blood on the sword so his soul encompasses into the weapon.
[44:10.67]I can't wield this unless it has the blood of the victor.
[44:14.07]I'm the victor and I take the master wand.
[44:16.47]I get his sword, but the blood has to be on it.
[44:19.46]That's why Voldemort went so crazy.
[44:21.42]Why do you think...
[44:27.42]Why do you think Timmy, Timmy Tiller, Ted Tiller, whatever his name was, went so crazy?
[44:32.92]He wanted that Master Wand!
[44:35.38]Okay, I need to save this game.
[44:40.16]Because I literally just got... This weapon is fucking awesome.
[44:43.68]I don't want to lose it.
[44:44.76]So let's be real here.
[44:46.96]And go to a bed.
[44:48.44]And relax.
[44:50.90]Where's...
[44:53.17]timmy turner yeah and fairly odd parents when timmy turner made the seven horcruxes it was fucked up he turned those two fairy people into like one of them was a car one was a snake and he threw him all over the place that's how timmy turner is able to stay alive as long as he can those are his horcruxes I need a bed
[45:19.85]No, actually, in the very beginning of the song, he names his horcruxes, oddly enough.
[45:25.59]What were they?
[45:26.33]That's the thing that I think nobody realized.
[45:29.56]What was it?
[45:31.38]He's got seven horcruxes.
[45:33.22]Guava cake, green juice, chocolate cake.
[45:35.88]I need to know.
[45:36.62]We need to know what Timmy Turner's horcruxes are.
[45:39.23]Because he fucking puts them on play this day, the seven of them.
[45:51.87]No, not yet.
[45:52.77]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[45:53.67]Here it comes.
[46:20.37]Here it comes!
[46:21.77]One!
[46:22.05]Two!
[46:22.71]Three!
[46:23.45]Four!
[46:23.97]Five!
[46:24.65]Six!
[46:25.23]Seven!
[46:25.97]The end of this Harry Potter!
[46:28.72]It's him.
[46:30.24]Write him down.
[46:37.81]Alright.
[46:48.60]Weren't you, like, 20 when this aired?
[46:50.33]Why don't I know?
[46:51.03]I haven't watched the Fairly Odd Birds in, like, over 10 years.
[47:00.35]Why would I, like, remember the whole song?
[47:02.35]It was a great show.
[47:08.39]Let's just go.
[47:11.05]I feel like I'm wanted here.
[47:13.21]I'm wanted everywhere, aren't I?
[47:17.07]I just need a bed.
[47:18.17]Wait, this is the church, right?
[47:20.93]Hmm.
[47:24.46]Report to Raz, and it should save.
[47:27.74]Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[47:28.74]Let's just go there.
[47:30.64]I'm gonna, like... I don't wanna go through town.
[47:33.62]Because I really do feel like someone's gonna stop me.
[47:35.50]Because I have a bunch of stolen shit.
[47:36.64]I'm just gonna ride there.
[47:37.54]It's right here.
[47:37.92]I'm just gonna be... They were counting on me to know.
[47:42.68]You just heard me try to say it.
[47:43.84]I said, like, one correct one.
[47:47.84]And by the way, I just spoiled the entire series of Harry Potter, so if anyone's upset about that, I'm sorry.
[47:53.15]But, like, come on.
[47:56.21]If you haven't seen Harry Potter by now, what's going on here, you know?
[48:07.56]Alright, for a second I thought I just said I spoiled all of the Fairly OddParents, and I'm just like, you can't spoil that show.
[48:14.80]I'm thinking about, oh, shit, I just spoiled the fairly odd parents.
[48:17.66]Oh, no, people are going to be pissed about that.
[48:20.50]What?
[48:21.00]How?
[48:23.38]There is no storyline.
[48:24.96]The kid has two fairly godparents that grant him wishes and turn into teapots and... Come on, get up here.
[48:35.07]That's not even that much of a 90 degree angle.
[48:37.09]You can do it.
[48:49.37]Yeah, it's odd.
[48:50.49]God, odd parents.
[48:52.91]Very odd parents.
[48:56.61]Odd parents, the odd godparents.
[49:00.80]Jamie, John, Green, Fraud, Shane, Fraud, Hot Rod.
[49:08.16]They are his godparents.
[49:09.94]They're the godparents.
[49:14.49]Odd parents, fairly odd grandparents.
[49:17.67]Where is he?
[49:22.03]jamie Sean seesaw seesaw dead guy dead guy dead guy dead guy dead guy dead guy wait they are dead how is he what god be with you lad what can I do for you how much weed did I smoke too much weed uh let's see I have some news about the investigation sir good tell me
[49:49.51]No, I don't smoke weed.
[49:50.09]The bandit in Užice has been killed.
[50:07.09]It seems they're trying to cover their tracks and get rid of witnesses.
[50:10.09]Indeed.
[50:10.45]The whole affair is becoming ever more suspicious.
[50:13.90]Have you any further clues?
[50:15.34]I found out about another one of them.
[50:17.16]A crony of Limpy Lubos's.
[50:18.92]They call him Riki, and he comes from Nadechko.
[50:21.68]You're doing a good job, but you need to be careful.
[50:24.37]You drink weed.
[50:25.79]This is a coffee.
[50:29.29]Runt is behind it all.
[50:30.39]I'm afraid my news isn't good, sir.
[50:33.55]I might have expected as much.
[50:35.58]Tell me the worst.
[50:36.32]My name is Reek.
[50:37.10]My name is Reek.
[50:37.84]Yes, your name is Reek.
[50:39.14]Yes, Reek.
[50:39.42]Milord.
[50:39.64]Sucker.
[51:05.99]Anything else?
[51:06.99]That's all I found out so far, sir.
[51:08.33]Sacre bleu!
[51:09.22]Alright.
[51:10.36]Come back and report to me as soon as you learn anything new.
[51:13.10]Alright, cool.
[51:16.26]Already did.
[51:17.08]Sir, I've been to Užit's and the parish priest there is very odd indeed.
[51:21.18]He's very handy with a sword.
[51:23.30]Do you know anything about him, sir?
[51:24.70]Godwyn?
[51:26.00]Aye.
[51:26.42]An intriguing fellow.
[51:28.12]He's the youngest son of one of the... He's a real weirdo.
[51:30.27]He was sent to the university to become a priest, as is customary with the youngest son.
[51:35.65]But he didn't much care for it.
[51:37.31]So when he finished studying, instead of taking up his parish, he went roaming.
[51:41.11]I imagine he had a pretty adventurous life.
[51:43.91]And then one day, he came back and settled down.
[51:46.09]Hey, wake up.
[51:46.87]Wake up.
[51:47.29]No resident sleeping right now?
[51:49.34]Wake up.
[51:51.80]Don't make me.
[51:54.06]Don't make me.
[51:55.82]Go get Voldemort.
[51:59.08]Timmy Turner.
[52:05.10]Tom Riddle, that was his name.
[52:07.17]Dumb name.
[52:08.45]If my name was Tom Riddle, I would also be like a murderous weirdo.
[52:17.55]There are a few people in them.
[52:18.97]They're scattered everywhere and we can't guard them all.
[52:21.27]But the bandits won't find much silver in places like that.
[52:24.00]There's always a Groschen or two.
[52:25.50]Tom Riddle.
[52:27.12]Timmy Riddle Turner.
[52:28.02]How much silver did they get from slaughtering those horses?
[52:30.44]True.
[52:31.56]If they'd stolen them, they could have sold them.
[52:33.57]Those were fine animals.
[52:34.93]Exactly.
[52:35.93]It's not about the silver.
[52:37.47]It's about something else.
[52:38.83]But what?
[52:39.79]Implying that Jeremy isn't a murderer's name.
[52:42.69]It's not.
[52:43.41]Jeremy?
[52:43.91]Think of all the great Jeremy's you've heard of in your life.
[52:47.11]Jeremy Twain.
[52:47.49]Jeremy Franklin.
[52:48.11]Jeremy... Jeremy Obama.
[52:49.21]You know?
[52:49.41]Jeremy Washington.
[53:05.93]These are all very important people in our history and our lives and everything, right?
[53:11.83]About that encampment, sir.
[53:14.02]What is it, lad?
[53:21.26]I never came back and reported anything, so I'm giving him the whole story.
[53:25.36]Big fellow, but more brawn than brain.
[53:28.09]The camp is an abandoned village in the woods to the west of Talmberg.
[53:31.43]Good work, lad.
[53:32.73]Have you been to check it out?
[53:34.25]Jeremy Schwarzenegger.
[53:35.15]That's another great one.
[53:35.85]That's right.
[53:36.25]I don't know much apart from where it is.
[53:38.65]We really need to find out more.
[53:41.09]Could you go back there and try to discover anything that could help us in the assault?
[53:45.21]The more we know, the better.
[53:46.91]And if you could carry out some sabotage while you're in there, it would be invaluable.
[53:50.25]Jeremy Schwarzenegger.
[53:52.45]That's so funny.
[54:02.14]Alright, I'll try.
[54:03.58]Certainly, sir.
[54:04.90]That is... I'll do what I can.
[54:07.78]That's what I like to hear.
[54:10.18]You'll be our eyes and ears, lad.
[54:11.88]Our success will depend on what you find out.
[54:13.81]Oh, God, Jeremy.
[54:14.95]Oh, Lord.
[54:15.41]Get back here as soon as you can.
[54:16.61]That's not good.
[54:17.29]Meanwhile, I'll muster my men.
[54:19.05]Jeremy Einstein.
[54:19.51]I'll find out what I can and be right back.
[54:21.89]So it's Jeremy Albert Einstein.
[54:23.63]It was his middle name.
[54:26.78]Alright, we got a lot of stuff to do.
[54:30.26]Be a bit more careful.
[54:31.48]Damn.
[54:36.83]Look at clown.
[54:40.35]Jeremy Turner and his fairly godparents.
[54:44.91]See, you guys got it.
[54:45.73]You guys get it.
[54:50.70]By the way, um, fuck that.
[54:53.88]I'm sorry, we need to talk about this.
[54:56.82]Uh, fairly, so you got these two godparents.
[55:00.38]That are always around.
[55:02.34]You can make them, oh, whatever you want.
[55:03.72]Oh, yeah, I want a chocolate shake.
[55:05.70]Oh, I want a million dollars.
[55:06.82]That's fine.
[55:09.81]What about when you're, like, spending special time with your girlfriend?
[55:15.23]Fairly godparents just sitting there hanging out.
[55:19.15]Brushing your teeth.
[55:19.59]What if they're taking a shit?
[55:21.61]Oddparents just hanging out there, like, watching you shit.
[55:25.04]I don't like that.
[55:32.51]That's not okay.
[55:33.29]I'm not okay with that.
[55:34.43]I want my privacy.
[55:36.07]That's total un-private.
[55:39.13]That's un-privacy.
[55:45.84]I think I would give up the wishes if I knew that somebody was literally always watching me.
[55:51.94]It's like real Santa Claus.
[55:54.40]Alright, we're gonna go here.
[55:56.42]I'm wanted here.
[55:57.00]Isn't that what that means?
[55:59.22]We're gonna go ooze shits and go backwards.
[56:02.94]I'm too overburdened.
[56:03.92]Fuck.
[56:04.30]Really?
[56:08.78]Well, I guess you could, like, wish... Like, if you had to go... If you had, like, really bad, like, shit cramps, right?
[56:13.93]You could just be like, Mom?
[56:15.39]Like, yes, what is it?
[56:18.25]Like, no.
[56:18.91]God... Godparent?
[56:19.75]What was her name?
[56:22.41]Wanda.
[56:23.03]Wando.
[56:24.17]Wanda.
[56:25.21]Yes, what is it, Timmy?
[56:27.51]I don't want to go to the bathroom right now.
[56:28.99]Make it so I don't have to.
[56:30.88]Okay, so of course we will and they you don't have to you don't have to go to the bathroom and they'll be fine And then Cosmo will show up he says something really funny and dumb like ah Kimmy you're so funny I'm a teapot now Fuck that guy.

[56:53.11]He never did anything worthwhile Wanda's the one that granted all the wishes
[56:59.92]Ah, ah, Timmy!
[57:02.30]That's all he did.
[57:04.50]Go to every episode, that's what he did.
[57:06.00]He said, ah, ah, Timmy, and then turned into something funny.
[57:09.75]Wanda was the fucking brains behind that whole operation.
[57:12.01]Don't even begin to fight that.
[57:30.27]Cosmo gave birth on an episode.
[57:41.23]What?
[57:44.38]Shut up.
[57:47.58]Even look at the theme song.
[57:50.18]What is Cosmo saying in the theme song?
[57:53.80]We're talking about a real fucking imbecile.
[57:56.14]You know what I'm saying?
[57:58.03]floaty crowny things.
[58:00.07]Doesn't even know what it's on his head.
[58:01.46]It's his.
[58:02.38]It's a crown.
[58:03.40]Floaty crown.
[58:04.14]We're talking about a real true moron.
[58:10.66]What a stupid asshole.
[58:17.55]This might be too much for the horse to do.
[58:20.61]Oh no.
[58:21.17]It's okay.
[58:23.07]He's projecting.
[58:27.40]I'm getting flashbacks to Red Dead Redemption right now.
[58:30.22]I think I'm going to be fine.
[58:37.53]It's fine.
[58:38.35]Horse is fine.
[58:40.11]That wasn't that far.
[58:41.35]That wasn't that far of a fall.
[58:43.29]No, no, no.
[58:45.59]No.
[58:48.43]Okay.
[58:49.85]He's fine.
[58:51.43]I don't have that much further.
[58:52.69]Holy shit, this is far.
[58:56.65]Can he make it?
[59:02.59]He's freaking out right now.
[59:08.38]No, I gotta get down lower.
[59:13.32]Okay.
[59:17.84]Come on!
[59:20.28]Can he make it?
[59:27.35]God damn it.
[59:28.43]Oh man, I'm in trouble.
[59:31.48]Can I slide down the rocks?
[59:42.30]I don't want to die here.
[59:46.11]I'm gonna fast travel now.
[59:51.99]I'm wanted here.
[59:53.03]I'm too overburdened.
[59:54.85]I can't fast travel from this location.
[59:56.71]Why not?
[59:57.89]Why?
[60:01.49]The Crimson Chin was Jay Leno.
[60:02.64]It was actually Jay Leno.
[60:04.32]This isn't going to kill me if I fall from this.
[60:06.36]It's deceiving, right?
[60:07.10]Nope, there's a little bit of a spot right there.
[60:08.50]Please don't kill me.
[60:11.12]I'm fine.
[60:11.70]Holy shit, that did a ton of damage, though.
[60:14.58]Alright, now we're good.
[60:15.26]Horse, where are you?
[60:21.59]I need to get away so he can't spawn.
[60:25.87]Yeah, it's a two-foot drop.
[60:26.75]You say that.
[60:27.19]It did 30% of my entire health pool.
[60:35.12]Where is he?
[60:35.40]I hear him.
[60:37.00]Hey!
[60:37.42]There you are.
[60:38.24]We're good.
[60:40.78]Pebbles is not dead.
[60:41.54]Pebbles is right here.
[60:43.46]Both of us are in peak physical condition.
[60:47.99]And, shortcut.
[61:00.07]I have to stop doing this.
[61:02.25]Jumping the fences, you just can't do it.
[61:04.93]It's not worth it.
[61:05.59]The horse can't jump that high.
[61:08.98]Just wish for some more HP.
[61:18.48]Alright, let's... Let's make a couple of deals here.
[61:23.37]Maybe get a couple of floaty-crowny things.
[61:27.77]Hi there.
[61:28.35]It's Dad!
[61:32.18]Oh, wait, did Dad shave?
[61:36.08]He's been alive this whole time.
[61:37.32]Holy shit.
[61:40.60]My respects to you.
[61:42.54]Dad, you shaved!
[61:48.14]Let's talk trade.
[61:51.80]Weapons.
[61:52.88]Alright, so now that I have on Soul Slicer... Let's sell this Mercenary's Bedfellow.
[62:03.13]Let's also sell... I have 50 one of these.
[62:07.64]Get rid of the villager's bow.
[62:08.84]This thing sucks.
[62:09.50]I already have the best bow in the damn game.
[62:16.80]Dad shaved and it made it... Yeah, well he's... He has to hide... It's like... Dude, back in the day... Shaving your beard was the equivalent of the witness protection program.
[62:27.51]If you had a huge beard the whole time... They didn't have IDs.
[62:32.93]No, you were a different person.
[62:34.99]You could change your identity.
[62:40.48]Didn't carry around anything.
[62:41.52]They didn't have iTunes accounts, guys.
[62:44.94]Back in like the 1200s.
[62:56.71]I majored in... No, I didn't major in history, but I should have.
[63:00.01]Okay, let's go... Let's do this.
[63:04.10]What's the shittiest stuff that I have that's absolutely broken?
[63:07.08]This is pretty broken.
[63:09.72]This is pretty broken.
[63:11.56]This is pretty broken.
[63:15.58]This is pretty broken.
[63:18.77]This is pretty broken.
[63:20.27]I wish I could... Ah, it's 26.
[63:21.35]Maybe I should... I might repair that.
[63:24.11]Old shirt, get out of here.
[63:26.89]Get out of here.
[63:30.29]How much is it to repair?
[63:31.31]Because I think I want to repair this and put it on.
[63:34.72]Because that's 10 defense.
[63:35.75]That's pretty good.
[63:39.79]I don't... These are just stupid.
[63:42.19]Who cares?
[63:43.61]Working boots.
[63:45.53]Riding boots.
[63:46.27]I'm going to save those.
[63:50.49]Just sell these.
[63:51.07]I don't care.
[63:53.95]Why am I wearing this?
[63:55.12]Get rid of this.
[63:56.98]Wait, was that stolen?
[63:59.32]Shit, this was stolen.
[64:02.06]Can't sell that.
[64:05.29]This is not stolen.
[64:07.75]Okay.
[64:11.73]So, we got... What am I currently wearing in that slot?
[64:18.69]These.
[64:18.97]Okay, those are fine.
[64:23.37]These slippers, I can't get rid of these.
[64:28.15]This is kind of destroyed.
[64:29.47]I like the color scheme of this, though.
[64:36.06]Alright, let's go to all.
[64:38.95]Let's check the basket, first of all.
[64:40.87]Let's haggle.
[64:45.83]I'd like to discuss the price.
[64:47.99]So do I. Alright, so.
[64:52.47]Let's go with $145.
[64:54.05]What about this?
[64:57.63]I'd almost shake on it.
[64:59.60]Almost.
[65:01.18]Mm-hmm.
[65:02.30]Fine, just take it.
[65:03.62]Oh, that's a decent price.
[65:04.34]Take the deal.
[65:07.61]Take the deal.
[65:12.01]What do we got?
[65:12.49]I'm okay now.
[65:16.88]Let's talk repairs.
[65:24.28]This is worth it, right?
[65:25.52]This is a chain mail.
[65:27.48]62 bucks.
[65:30.83]What else we got?
[65:31.35]This mail coif.
[65:36.02]I want to wear that.
[65:37.06]Um, this is... I'm going to get this to fully repaired.
[65:42.77]What else have we got here?
[65:43.49]Let's do the coif, too.
[65:48.05]It's 181 bucks, whatever.
[65:50.91]Haggle.
[65:51.85]Everything else okay?
[65:52.77]Yeah.
[65:55.11]I mean, this is only 16 bucks.
[65:58.47]You can't repair an item that's at zero.
[66:01.91]Ah, shit.
[66:02.51]Okay, well, good thing I got this in here.
[66:08.44]Haggle.
[66:11.15]You can repair the sword.
[66:13.33]You're amazing that my gear get this bad.
[66:17.59]What are you talking about?
[66:18.93]Hey, what are you talking about?
[66:19.95]165.
[66:19.97]170.
[66:20.59]Yeah.
[66:20.91]Now all that shit's good to go now.
[66:21.95]Let's put it on.
[66:39.30]Sell slices at 100.
[66:41.81]That's good.
[66:42.45]Put on the riding boots.
[66:48.03]Chainmail.
[66:49.65]I actually have armor now.
[66:50.85]That's good.
[66:53.13]I'm still wearing this.
[66:55.23]Although I need... Missing... For... Yeah, these are actually better.
[67:06.27]I need something to go underneath this.
[67:09.63]This shit I have is too broken.
[67:12.79]Soul Slicer no longer stolen.
[67:15.25]Nope.
[67:16.81]Apparently not.
[67:21.08]Alright, we'll go from here.
[67:22.02]I need to... What do you have for sale?
[67:27.06]It never was stolen.
[67:28.12]Well, here's the thing.
[67:28.66]He died, and then I took it.
[67:33.30]What do you have for armor?
[67:35.83]Alright, he's got a Koi for $10.
[67:38.55]He's got a bassinet for $78.
[67:40.15]That's a... Although I do need both of these.
[67:46.06]I've got 1.4k.
[67:50.48]I could get an old bassinet.
[67:54.26]This thing sucks, but it's way less expensive.
[67:56.59]Absolutely.
[68:02.69]Wait, did I sell that to him?
[68:08.31]Hold on, did I sell this to him?
[68:10.47]No, I didn't.
[68:13.94]Sorry, I'm willing to spend the 10 bucks on this.
[68:15.94]No, I sold him this one.
[68:24.58]Why am I doing this?
[68:25.66]Because I want the bassinet.
[68:29.91]Free.
[68:30.05]Free.
[68:40.82]Buy a shield so you can be shield guy.
[68:44.18]I'm alright with that.
[68:47.56]That's fine.
[68:48.84]Let's put it on.
[68:55.02]Okay.
[68:59.60]Bingo.
[69:03.04]We are good to go.
[69:09.06]I'm wearing something that's currently zero.

[73:17.10]What's so wrong with that?
[73:20.54]You can't pay for murder!
[73:21.86]Uh, yeah you can.
[73:25.93]That's shit.
[73:26.65]Looks like it's time for me to grow a beard.
[73:30.09]Get a new ID.
[73:44.68]Everybody's got a prize.
[73:45.74]Do we have a bed here?
[73:51.30]Is this a bad guy camp?
[73:53.10]It better not be.
[74:00.37]Good guy?
[74:00.93]Bad guy?
[74:01.57]Good guy camp?
[74:05.03]Wait, I've already been here.
[74:05.77]I already killed all the people here.
[74:08.85]So it's a good guy camp, because now it's my camp.
[74:13.67]Everyone already here is dead.
[74:15.15]This is my encampment now.
[74:18.43]Nice.
[74:18.61]Is there food?
[74:26.00]Hey, this is food from like four days ago.
[74:31.24]Alright, let's go.
[74:31.78]Let's go to bed.
[74:34.84]That food cooked itself.
[74:36.02]I ate that before.
[74:36.78]Somebody else came here and cooked.
[74:42.58]Can you make that any more creepy?
[74:45.86]What are you doing?
[74:50.97]Alright, my energy is... I don't even need to sleep.
[74:59.63]Let's get back to full health.
[75:11.22]Dear Mr. Jeremy J. Jermison, have you decided on what the next game you're going to play is?
[75:16.54]Yes.
[75:17.83]We're going to play Monster Rancher tomorrow on PlayStation 1.
[75:22.13]It's a very interesting game.
[75:23.19]You'll see.
[75:26.55]It's going to be a little bit of a funny stream, you know?
[75:30.10]We're going to be having a funny time.
[75:40.25]Just go back to bed.
[75:42.14]Fuck it.
[75:51.76]That's a funny way of saying Monster Hunter.
[75:53.14]No, Monster Rancher.
[76:01.53]The original Monster Rancher.
[76:05.65]Who lit the fire?
[76:06.51]I don't know.
[76:09.33]Some dude.
[76:13.55]This is how I live my life, just in bed, way longer than healthy.
[76:18.61]Yeah, you don't want to sleep for too long.
[76:24.43]I'm guilty of this.
[76:27.18]I sleep a lot.
[76:29.88]And it's bad.
[76:30.42]It's not good for you.
[76:31.52]You really should only be sleeping like six to eight hours a day.
[76:37.44]Somebody did laundry.
[76:40.14]Anybody cook any food while I was asleep?
[76:51.76]Now, let's cook in the fire.
[76:53.82]Only six?
[76:55.24]Yeah, like six to eight hours.
[76:59.68]Eight to ten?
[77:00.30]Eight to ten?
[77:01.28]Eight to ten?
[77:02.62]Huh?
[77:06.92]Four to six.
[77:11.50]Alright, do I actually have cooked?
[77:15.54]Not that it's gonna be any better.
[77:16.70]Yeah, cooked.
[77:17.40]It's fucking rotten.
[77:24.31]I have ro- I have 20 cooked ro- Just because it's cooked doesn't mean it's edible.
[77:28.71]I'm gonna eat the dried fruit I have left.
[77:37.14]Drink some water.
[77:41.20]Alright, I'm ready.
[77:43.38]Game didn't save.
[77:45.60]I need to- That's- Fuck me, man.
[77:53.36]Uh, the game is gonna save right up here, I believe.
[77:58.66]Eat maggots for protein?
[78:00.96]Don't be so shocked.
[78:03.55]Another hundred years or so when there's no more carrots?
[78:07.39]Now, in like 75 years when potatoes can't grow ever again, you're gonna be eating bugs?
[78:33.66]Yeah, once the last lineage of cows dies, and then their DNA has just been absolutely ransacked to a point where they can't breed anymore in like another 200 years.
[78:44.87]There ain't gonna be any more hamburgers, guys.
[78:47.63]Enjoy it while you can.
[78:53.71]Woodcutters can't.
[78:55.57]They look like a bunch of woodcutters.
[78:59.49]Go to the fork with the ruined cabin.
[79:01.65]Oh.
[79:02.83]Let's talk to this guy first.
[79:03.83]A cow's gonna come to Mars?
[79:08.09]No.
[79:08.15]Let's see if I can buy a safe potion.
[79:10.19]He already sold his odd parents.
[79:12.43]See?
[79:12.61]I'm with that guy.
[79:13.53]He probably got a lot of money.
[79:30.10]A cool one to two million.
[79:32.20]Take him.
[79:34.50]Is it you?
[79:43.91]They should do it easy with that thing.
[79:45.61]Just buy the granary.
[79:49.57]He's gonna find him.
[79:50.45]He's probably just hanging out somewhere.
[80:01.80]You know, I will tell you, for having a eat food in this game, game mechanic, it's kind of an extreme afterthought.
[80:12.03]There's a pot with beans in it everywhere.
[80:22.72]There's no trader here.
[80:25.20]Maybe he's like down here.
[80:31.75]What was his name?
[80:33.09]Joseph?
[80:34.79]Oh yes, there's a farmer here named Joseph.
[80:36.46]He'll trade anything you want.
[80:37.48]I mean, this is not a granary.
[80:46.40]I have no idea where the hell the granary is.
[80:51.81]Let's look at the map.
[80:56.23]Blacksmith camp.
[80:57.65]I mean, like, oi.
[81:02.03]What happened to my quest?
[81:06.09]Oi!
[81:06.29]Uh, oi.
[81:12.49]What's going on here?
[81:17.82]Huh?
[81:21.72]Go and scout out the bandit's camp.
[81:23.08]Find the bandit's camp.
[81:24.00]Go to the fort with the ruined cabin.
[81:31.67]Um... Scout, location of the camp with a bandit's attack.
[81:36.31]I've got to find as much as I can about the camp end if possible.
[81:39.13]Go to the fork with the ruined cabin.
[81:41.29]So that's like up here, I guess.
[81:42.55]Okay.
[81:58.07]Fork with the ruined cabin.
[82:00.94]And then, um... Go straight ahead to the next fork by clearing... By clearing the big beech tree.
[82:11.29]Go straight ahead.
[82:16.15]Um... Wait, he said, like, left.
[82:18.25]I don't even know what the hell he said.
[82:19.64]It's just over here.
[82:22.62]Big clearing of the beech tree.
[82:26.36]Next fork.
[82:37.32]Got some more horsemanship.
[82:41.20]I see people up here, though.
[82:45.25]Take a left to get... There's a lot of people over there.
[82:51.75]What's going on?
[82:52.59]What is this?
[82:54.39]Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[82:55.85]Perfect.
[82:57.70]Nice.
[82:57.96]Like a random fight for no reason.
[82:59.58]This is where I just come in and... I'm just gonna be a seagull at the beach.
[83:03.42]I'm gonna come in and get all the leftover bread.
[83:12.14]Oh my god, there's some old french fries here too?
[83:28.03]Holy shit, that was a... What the fuck is that?
[83:31.43]What is that?
[83:35.03]Wow.
[83:37.57]That's a lot of stuff.
[83:40.73]I can't move.
[83:42.20]I've got to get... I'm too full.
[83:45.38]Too many fucking old french fries.
[83:50.00]Holy shit.
[83:54.40]Come to me.
[83:57.42]Oh shit, a human.
[84:04.32]Oh, what a good day.
[84:08.18]What a good day to be a seagull.
[84:09.42]Why am I holding this?
[84:16.28]Why is this equipped?
[84:22.13]Get this off, I don't want this equipped.
[84:30.49]Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.
[84:32.95]What happened?
[84:34.18]Okay.
[84:35.48]I'm just gonna have a fucking heart attack.
[84:40.58]There's so much of this shit that's all stolen.
[84:48.09]I thought I lost that weapon.
[84:50.25]I don't want this equipped.
[84:51.16]It's just permanently on my body.
[84:53.64]Where is it?
[84:56.34]I don't see it.
[85:02.12]It's my mounted weapon?
[85:04.87]Interesting.
[85:11.37]Yikes.
[85:15.91]Oh my goodness, this is so much better than what I fucking have.
[85:19.08]Even though it's kind of broken.
[85:21.62]Chainmail.
[85:22.42]There's so much of this.
[85:25.40]Horse can't even carry anymore either.
[85:30.30]God damn it.
[85:31.20]Alright, I need to just throw... Alright, it's time for the great dumpening of 2018.
[85:39.93]What do I have?
[85:43.65]It sucks.
[85:45.21]Get rid of it.
[85:51.23]Get rid of this dump.
[85:53.35]I don't care what it is.
[85:54.13]If it's less than a dollar, it's gone.
[86:06.36]Broken.
[86:06.78]One.

[86:51.73]Sort by weight.
[86:52.43]Yeah, but... I can repair this.
[86:56.91]I'm not getting rid of that.
[86:58.14]And I can wear it.
[87:00.14]Eventually here, though, this... Why would I need to carry this?
[87:03.58]Dump it.
[87:04.28]No, wait.
[87:04.50]Go to the horse.
[87:08.64]Sort by weight on the horse.

[87:38.91]The Viggo Mortensen.
[87:39.75]I'm going to hold on to it.
[87:42.03]The horse now has a little bit more space.
[87:45.57]Which means I can put this to the horse.
[87:49.47]This also to the horse.
[87:53.81]Dump.
[87:57.01]Dump.

[88:53.93]Are these better?
[88:57.21]These are just better.
[89:00.81]Move to the horse.
[89:06.35]I'm so close!
[89:08.60]Ah!
[89:09.40]Go to the horse again.
[89:12.83]Knight's sword.
[89:13.53]I can sell these, though.
[89:14.49]These aren't stolen, technically.
[89:20.59]See, this is going to be... I can't... Human shield.
[89:24.82]I mean, if I have this, the human shield is worse.
[89:30.70]All these gloves.

[89:32.56]They're just terrible.
[89:33.52]Get rid of them.
[89:36.20]Get rid of all these.
[89:37.16]This old shit that I don't... Why am I holding on to this?
[89:42.09]That's enough for one more spot.
[89:44.45]Get all the hunting boots.
[89:49.61]All the beers, I'm just gonna drink them.
[89:54.26]Player, go to the beers.
[90:00.58]Just slam them down.
[90:02.44]Wait, what?
[90:03.96]He's stuffed.
[90:05.50]Fine.
[90:07.72]Alright, we're almost ready to leave.
[90:15.56]Last little bit here.
[90:16.66]144.
[90:20.54]Are these better than what I have on?
[90:25.27]No.
[90:27.03]Come on, almost there.
[90:29.53]Come on!
[90:30.01]136.
[90:30.03]I can literally just drink one juice and I'll be fine.
[90:46.10]133.7.
[90:46.50]133.5.
[90:49.47]Oh, drop all of these.
[90:53.65]All of them.
[90:55.01]Time to move.
[90:58.59]They left the scraps.
[90:59.63]I'm ready.
[91:05.56]Where am I going?
[91:06.90]Oh, shit.
[91:07.60]I gotta move.
[91:09.04]I think I'm going the right way.
[91:13.61]Oh, wait, guy.
[91:14.49]Guy that's gonna recognize all the stuff that's on the ground.
[91:16.19]Gotta avoid him.
[91:22.71]Avoided.
[91:23.03]Go left?
[91:31.91]Didn't I already go left from before?
[91:38.83]Did I not take that left?
[91:40.75]Let me go back there.
[91:45.65]That was like a 15 minute ordeal.
[91:51.56]Was I supposed to go left here?
[91:54.00]Like where?
[91:56.34]God, I've already fucking lost it.
[91:58.82]I was going left until I went full seagull.
[92:03.67]No, I was going the right way, right?
[92:05.49]Right now they're trying to find where the seagull is and it's me.
[92:08.27]So I was going the right way.
[92:13.85]This was left, wasn't it?
[92:19.89]No.
[92:20.23]No, no, no.
[92:20.63]Really?
[92:22.07]I'm terrified to go over there.
[92:33.54]You seagull.
[92:34.78]I don't want to take the road back there.
[92:36.72]Oh, hey, look.
[92:38.44]Left.
[92:39.42]Found it.
[92:42.10]Hey, look at that!
[92:43.80]He went left!
[93:08.24]Just like it.
[93:08.98]Always left.
[93:11.45]Who the fuck are you?
[93:25.83]If you always go left, you win any maze.
[93:27.81]That's true.
[93:33.19]Where am I now?
[93:36.62]I think I'm going this correct way.
[93:37.90]Let's make sure I am.
[93:40.51]Go and take a left and continue on the path to the next fork, which is coming up right here.
[93:48.46]Take a left and continue on the path to the next fork.
[93:50.66]Take a left.
[93:54.88]Okay.
[93:55.14]Go to the junction.
[94:03.15]Just skewer random people on the road.
[94:06.29]That's not nice.
[94:08.29]But fine.
[94:09.55]This guy's about to go to bed.
[94:13.43]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[94:15.34]Can he hear me?
[94:15.88]What we have here.
[94:16.46]What's happened to you?
[94:39.68]Wouldn't you rather have just some shoes?
[94:40.90]Got an extra pair of shoes.
[94:42.50]Yeah, I'll give him some shoes.
[94:44.50]There, I got an extra pair of shoes.
[95:10.67]Take care, dude.
[95:11.83]He's still not wearing them.
[95:14.01]He's got huge feet, by the way.
[95:15.91]You're welcome.
[95:16.73]Wait, hold on to that.
[95:18.53]I gave him my shoes.
[95:40.89]That's something that Jesus would have done.
[95:42.59]He would have given his own sandals.
[95:44.05]And he did.
[95:44.51]In the book of... In the book of Messiah 14 and dash 9.
[95:49.68]Jesus gave his sandals to some guy.
[95:51.58]I don't have any more.
[95:58.59]Does the horse have any?
[96:01.61]The horse has shoes, right?
[96:06.03]See?
[96:08.43]I'm fine.
[96:13.26]I got plenty of shoes.
[96:14.82]You guys are out of your minds.
[96:20.75]Done.
[96:21.91]Except there's a three.
[96:23.09]I think I just brought something else here.
[96:24.81]Four.
[96:30.23]Let's go.
[96:31.67]Continue straight.
[96:36.63]Wear the horse's shoes.
[96:37.77]So that guy's going to... At some point during the... During the game.
[96:41.65]We're going to get a Resident Evil 4 situation here.
[96:45.93]In one of the boss fights, Dog's going to come and save me.
[96:50.55]That guy's going to remember the shoes.
[96:51.97]And in the middle of a boss fight, he's going to jump down.
[96:53.93]And jump on the guy's back and wrestle him around.
[96:56.87]It's going to give me an opportunity.
[97:09.08]Yeah, that is true.
[97:09.98]Hold on.
[97:10.28]I think I have a... I do have a couple of skills, I think.
[97:16.24]Yeah, I do.
[97:17.36]Alright, main level we got... Knight Rider.
[97:20.34]Okay, Wanderer.
[97:23.04]You grew up in an impoverished condition, so comfort of beds is inverted for you.
[97:26.83]The worse the bed, the better you sleep.
[97:29.87]Okay, interesting.
[97:32.19]Burger.
[97:34.79]Eh, we got more things.
[97:35.67]Savage...
[97:37.62]stat boost in the wild.
[97:38.84]Scout 2.
[97:42.74]That's pretty good.
[97:43.42]Brute.
[97:46.00]You get a plus 2 strength bonus, but a minus 1 penalty on charisma and speech.
[97:53.20]I think I want this.
[97:55.28]Golden Tongue.
[97:57.14]You get a plus 2 to speech, but a minus 2 to strength.
[97:59.90]No thanks.
[98:00.78]Don't think so.
[98:02.72]Agile.
[98:05.28]Agility bonus.
[98:06.20]Ken.
[98:07.80]You're handsome and characteristic, but you haven't built up enough strength.
[98:11.82]No, we're not doing Ken.
[98:12.70]We're not doing Scott.
[98:13.68]Wait a minute.
[98:17.95]No.
[98:19.47]I'm going to do the strength.
[98:20.11]We're going to do Brute.
[98:23.11]You get a +2 strength bonus, minus a penalty.
[98:25.41]But the speech fails 75% of the time for me anyways.
[98:28.71]I'm doing Brute.
[98:29.90]I'm not going to do Ken.
[98:33.44]You want me to get my ass kicked even more?
[98:38.34]Doing Brute.
[98:42.98]Skills.
[98:43.60]Combat.
[98:44.44]I don't think I have anything else.
[98:50.34]Great.
[98:51.12]Great choice.
[98:53.02]Debuffs.
[98:53.69]Overreacting.
[98:54.35]Alright, that's good.
[98:58.59]Let's go.
[99:00.11]Another Tridot.
[99:06.23]You bumped into me, guy.
[99:22.67]Take that guy's hat.
[99:25.47]No, that guy doesn't deserve to have his hat taken from him.
[99:31.15]Overreacting.
[99:31.97]Incur a 0.2 meltdown penalty per hour.
[99:36.77]Exactly.
[99:38.67]Sabotage... Game saved.
[99:39.91]Sabotage the bandits before the battle begins.
[99:44.23]Carry on straight at the crossroad.
[99:46.97]Is this a bandit?
[99:47.53]Can I stab him?
[100:04.65]Didn't you learn the first thing about keep away?
[100:06.73]What are you doing?
[100:22.28]Holy shit, he's learning!
[100:27.94]Take out the sword!
[100:38.44]Come on, do it again.
[100:41.26]Yeah, sure.
[100:41.78]Whatever you say.
[100:43.72]You're dead.
[100:44.00]I need to be careful here.
[100:48.87]Villager's bow.
[100:51.11]Seek's lockpick.
[100:53.71]I can't just take everything.
[100:54.99]Take his money.
[100:57.79]This thing sells for a thousand dollars.
[101:02.31]Fuck.
[101:03.03]Why can't I just take more stuff?
[101:04.41]There's so much stuff here.
[101:11.24]I can't do it.
[101:12.54]I can't take it.
[101:15.30]I wish I could.
[101:15.92]This common shield... I mean, that thing is a thousand... Wowee!
[101:25.33]Wowee, wowee!
[101:26.37]Wowee!
[101:26.59]Wowee!
[101:26.91]Wowee!
[101:27.19]Holy!
[101:27.79]Holy shit!
[101:28.95]Wowee!
[101:44.02]Wow.
[101:44.90]Too many people.
[101:50.24]Out of my way.
[101:56.81]All of you.
[101:57.19]The lot of you.
[101:58.49]Holy sh- God, God, God, God, God, God.
[102:02.85]Where am I?
[102:04.04]What is happening right now?
[102:06.48]Why am I flying?
[102:20.42]Come on, do it.
[102:27.38]Why am I doing this?
[102:34.20]Who wants to fight?
[102:38.85]Who's going to fight?
[102:39.97]Who's going to swing first?
[102:40.65]You?
[102:40.75]Damn it.
[102:55.82]Put your weapons down.
[102:59.19]Drop it.
[103:08.53]Too many.
[103:09.05]Too many.
[103:09.31]That's too many.
[103:09.91]That's too many.
[103:10.40]What the fuck is going on?
[103:22.00]I'm just like stuck in the fucking trees.
[103:23.78]Look at this.
[103:24.16]What the fuck is going on right now?
[103:25.78]Why am I able to do this?
[103:30.22]Somebody fucking explain this.
[103:32.36]Why did I turn into a drone documentary?
[103:35.70]Huh?
[103:38.49]I was doing so well too.
[103:50.39]Where do I go from here?
[103:55.65]That's alright.
[103:59.15]As you can see, the trees and the moat combine into one of the most beautiful scenes in the Outback.
[104:11.95]What the fuck is this?
[104:23.18]I'm gonna kill this guy.
[104:27.02]Um, somebody hit me.
[104:30.36]Who hit me, again?
[104:32.18]Oh, the guy with the bo- Thanks for the smartest thing I've been told to do all day.
[104:43.64]This is gonna be impossible.
[104:50.85]This raining arrow's down.
[104:52.81]I won't be able to hit anyone.
[104:57.19]That's right, run from the hacker!
[105:01.63]Um... What was the objective?
[105:06.07]You wanna have an arrow fight?
[105:10.69]I swear to god, if I die up here... Where's the guy with the bow?
[105:19.01]Right there.
[105:22.23]He's doing it too, he's doing it too.
[105:25.62]This is fucking so stupid.
[105:28.24]I'm gonna lose and I have advantage.
[105:33.06]I actually have the advantage.
[105:36.10]I can't even hit him.
[105:40.30]I can't hit him.
[105:41.18]The arrows are going through him.
[105:43.20]The arrows are going through his body.
[105:46.75]Did you see that?
[105:53.69]I'm dead.
[105:59.22]I need to just die.
[106:00.12]This is just out of control.
[106:03.86]Just kill me.
[106:09.59]Get me back on the ground!
[106:10.59]It's a good thing it's saved.
[106:24.00]What is going on now?
[106:27.88]Really?
[106:29.42]What the fuck is happening right now?
[106:32.90]Hey, good thing it's saved!
[106:34.98]Yeah, this sure makes perfect sense!
[106:38.52]I have a broken neck, I have a permanent broken neck.
[106:42.01]What is going on here?
[106:43.95]Game, why are you... Yeah, that's... Are we... Are we doing alright here?
[106:56.11]Get off the horse?
[107:01.42]What the fuck is happening?
[107:04.24]Dude, what's the objective?
[107:06.50]What happened?
[107:08.94]Sabotage the bandits before the battle begins.
[107:10.72]Sabotage... Set fire to... Go back to Radzig.
[107:19.22]Alright, see you later.
[107:32.56]I don't even understand what I'm actually supposed to be doing here.
[107:40.11]I guess I'm going to kill this guy.
[107:41.41]Bye.
[108:06.32]Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
[108:07.68]Do it again.
[108:19.49]I have no skill in defense.
[108:25.75]Where did- Where the fuck is- Why?
[108:28.84]What the f- I don't understand this game.
[108:33.83]That guy just summoned people.
[108:35.34]He did like a necromancer move.
[108:52.47]What is the combo that I learned?
[108:57.61]I'm gonna die.
[108:58.55]I can't even look at it.
[108:59.39]What is it?
[108:59.69]Left, down, and then right?
[109:05.06]Something like that.
[109:05.72]I think it would... Somebody keeps spawning people.
[109:18.50]It's not fair.
[109:19.16]They don't even know what to do.
[109:20.26]Their AI doesn't work.
[109:24.27]Fight me on the roof.
[109:27.39]Which one of you has the balls?
[109:30.65]Huh?
[109:32.71]I just think you have the fucking stones, mate.
[109:47.39]You guys wouldn't believe how impossible it is to shoot a bow and arrow.
[109:52.37]Without any agility.
[109:53.38]Like, it doesn't even matter.
[109:58.20]This is the hardest thing to do in the whole game.
[110:10.84]Okay, I've hit this guy in the face twice.
[110:20.94]Okay, yeah, there you go.
[110:22.36]It's the same guy, I just keep hitting him with the helmet.
[110:36.64]I wish I had a fucking grenade, man.
[110:39.04]Why are there no grenades in this game?
[110:42.04]Oh, they're getting too close.
[110:48.32]Ow, fuck.
[110:48.98]Is somebody up here?
[110:49.60]Somebody is shooting at me.
[110:51.26]I think it's these guys over here.
[111:00.17]I'm gonna get them to kill each other.
[111:01.05]Watch this.
[111:04.07]Holy shit, I just got... No, no, no!
[111:07.29]Don't get dragged over there.
[111:11.25]Somebody swing.
[111:15.20]Watch this.
[111:16.00]This should work.
[111:18.06]As long as I dodge, if I block.
[111:20.30]Wait, do I have a shield?
[111:20.94]I have a shield, don't I?
[111:25.01]Shoot him.
[111:25.89]Shoot your friend.
[111:27.05]Right in the head.
[111:27.83]Do it.
[111:29.51]Shoot your friend directly in his head.
[111:32.02]Do it.
[111:33.72]Do it.
[111:35.20]Do it, Anakin.
[111:36.64]Why are you not shooting?
[111:39.20]It's too funny, man.
[111:50.49]I have to keep it going.
[111:51.95]It's too much.
[111:55.04]The thing is, like... I'm like a bird.
[112:02.03]Okay, I can do this.
[112:02.91]I'm going to kill everybody.
[112:04.71]You're going to see the fucking strategy.
[112:07.29]What do you mean?
[112:09.43]What?
[112:11.30]Alright, good.
[112:12.64]Come on.
[112:13.96]Ain't going to take much.
[112:17.34]Good.
[112:17.74]Level up the sword.
[112:18.28]Ha.
[112:18.34]He's had enough.
[112:24.05]Give us.
[112:26.57]Watch out for the guy with the arrows.
[112:29.17]He's gonna miss it.
[112:30.29]Oh my fucking god, I'm gonna lose.
[112:31.61]He just tried to strangle me.
[112:45.25]One guy's scared.
[112:50.21]Oh my god, all the guys with the arrows need to go.
[112:57.10]Walk onto him.
[112:57.60]Alright, he's scared.
[113:05.18]Bandage, bandage.
[113:13.25]I'm gonna take a potion too.
[113:19.49]I can't take this?
[113:23.24]I can't use it when I'm in combat.
[113:24.54]Shit.
[113:25.36]Oh well.
[113:28.60]It's gonna take a matter of time before I scare everybody.
[113:31.44]Doing good.
[113:31.72]He's running.
[113:33.84]He's getting his arrows out.
[113:34.66]Right in the head.
[113:55.44]No, no, no, no!
[113:57.06]Lost position!
[114:02.16]No!
[114:03.24]No!
[114:04.77]I don't know what to do here.
[114:08.07]I'm going to have to leave.
[114:08.95]I can't do anything in this camp.
[114:14.55]I'm going to reload.
[114:15.45]Yeah, we had our fun.
[114:19.88]We had our fun here.
[114:22.16]It's time to do it the real way.
[114:24.41]Look at the loot if you win.
[114:25.46]I'm not gonna win.
[114:26.14]There's too many.
[114:26.74]I just wish there was, like, dynamite.
[114:37.83]Use the halberd?
[114:38.47]I... Hold on.
[114:42.63]This thing?
[114:52.63]Like... No, this is like a mace.
[114:59.21]What's that?
[114:59.51]Where is it?
[115:00.29]I never picked it up?
[115:02.40]Oh.
[115:02.64]Wait, the horse has something like that.
[115:04.50]This is a huge weapon, right?
[115:10.92]I never picked it up.
[115:15.11]This is kind of what I'm looking for, isn't it?
[115:19.53]Let's see.
[115:22.03]No, this is just like a regular weapon.
[115:23.51]This is like a regular axe.
[115:24.73]Yeah, this is an axe.
[115:25.57]It's not long enough.
[115:31.72]Shit.
[115:32.10]I'm fucked.
[115:34.10]Spear?
[115:34.52]I do... Do I have a spear?
[115:42.60]Spear would do... Saber, saber.
[115:47.98]I don't have like a... Is it axe?
[115:52.81]There's no spear.
[115:54.41]I can't use the mounted weapon, I just tried to.
[115:59.15]All I can do is just this.
[116:02.76]This is what I have to work on.
[116:09.62]But they all have helmets on.
[116:10.82]Only this guy's the guy I can hit in the face.
[116:16.00]And even an arrow to the head, he's still fine.
[116:23.78]What the fuck are you doing?
[116:26.38]Hold on.
[116:26.74]They're fighting each other now.
[116:27.78]They're getting bored.
[116:29.19]He's bored of me.
[116:32.63]Wow, they're so done with this.
[116:33.73]They're just doing PvP outside of Stormwind waiting for me.
[116:40.05]Hope this guy wins.
[116:54.82]Is he so hellbent?
[116:56.24]He's still trying to kill this guy.
[117:01.94]Who the fuck is this guy?
[117:04.37]Oh, let me bandage again.
[117:06.57]It's not worth leaving yet.
[117:12.11]It's not worth leaving.
[117:14.71]Let's bandage.
[117:20.14]Do I have any more bandages?
[117:21.18]I think I do.
[117:23.89]What are they under?
[117:24.41]Food?
[117:26.33]No.
[117:26.77]Armor?
[117:27.17]All?
[117:27.37]Where is it?
[117:31.77]Where is it under?
[117:36.96]You can't use item in combat.
[117:38.44]Didn't I just do this?
[117:42.94]Yeah, this dude is... I think this guy thinks that... Hold on.
[117:48.10]See if we can tag this guy to fight another enemy.
[117:51.39]Alright, so now is he going to get angry at somebody?
[117:54.26]That seems to be the catalyst here.
[118:00.55]I'm gonna bleed out.
[118:04.11]He's still going after this guy.
[118:16.00]I'm gonna bleed.
[118:18.98]Now, what are they looking at?
[118:31.73]In the chest.
[118:33.09]Take a look at him.
[118:33.65]He still wants to fight the guy on the ground.
[118:37.71]I wonder if I can get out of combat.
[118:38.87]Wait, can I wait?
[118:41.46]No.
[118:45.04]I can apparently use it now.
[118:47.34]Alright, hold on.
[118:51.26]I can drink a potion now.
[118:55.93]Eat.
[118:58.07]Oh, we're gonna be good.
[118:59.67]We're gonna be fine.
[119:02.29]Somebody's asleep.
[119:05.94]Uh, should I drink more than one?
[119:13.84]My health is at 20.
[119:15.19]Um, I gotta bandage again, I think.
[119:20.56]bandage.
[119:22.78]What's the quick way to get to bandages?
[119:24.16]Because I feel like I'm doing this really stupidly.
[119:29.08]Alright, let's just hang out.
[119:30.66]Yeah, they're sleeping.
[119:31.29]Yep.
[119:34.87]It's going to get to be night time.
[119:39.85]This guy on the right just nodded off.
[119:41.01]The guy in the middle is also nodding off. ...
[119:51.14]Here we go, here we go!
[119:58.26]More PvP!
[120:01.46]Stop it, I wanna see this.
[120:03.78]Oh, is there a zoom button?
[120:12.36]More board PvP.
[120:13.72]If that guy comes back, I'm gonna laugh my ass off.
[120:19.81]Yeah, you can't run away from a duel, man.
[120:22.41]You wait for the countdown and then you do it.
[120:23.89]Alright, is he coming back?
[120:31.84]I don't think he's coming back.
[120:34.60]Hey, wake up.
[120:42.63]Excuse me.
[120:43.61]No nodding off right now.
[120:45.27]Wake up.
[120:46.75]You need to hold your position.
[120:49.52]The criminal's still on the roof!
[120:52.68]Use different arrows.
[120:54.16]I have... let's see.
[120:56.52]Better long distance arrow, better piercing arrow.
[121:01.30]Okay.
[121:07.10]That guy still hasn't come back yet.
[121:13.52]Right in the chest.
[121:14.86]Still sleeping.
[121:17.09]I really kind of want to sit here until night time.
[121:19.83]I only have one.
[121:20.49]I don't have any more of those arrows.
[121:25.77]Better... Yeah, I have one.
[121:31.99]We have to make this shot count.
[121:34.57]Alright, this guy right here.
[121:36.33]Right in the teeth.
[121:40.84]Now he's running away.
[121:46.92]I think we're good now.
[121:48.28]I think it's time to actually take care of these people.
[121:54.80]Check the horse.
[121:59.34]I don't have a melee weapon equipped.
[122:08.17]Where is he?
[122:09.01]Horse?
[122:09.27]I think the horse might not be available at the moment.
[122:21.18]Whoa!
[122:23.20]That's scary.
[122:23.84]Don't do that ever again.
[122:34.33]It's now starting to rain.
[122:35.45]Oh, here comes another guy.
[122:37.13]Oh.
[122:39.55]Oh, I just wanted to see if he was still there.
[122:41.47]I'm going back to bed.
[122:43.11]I'm gonna go play Nintendo.
[122:44.07]Wake me when he's actually down.
[122:49.31]Is he doing arrows?
[122:50.49]Ooh, you've learned.
[122:51.53]Fucking arrows.
[123:02.10]Asshole.
[123:05.53]Aye, aye, aye.
[123:06.25]I gotta kill this guy.
[123:07.73]No, no, no.
[123:08.45]You're getting distanced now.
[123:16.23]Can I pull the arrow out of my chest and use it?
[123:17.73]He's being smart.
[123:18.99]Okay, now he's stupid again?
[123:21.61]Maybe.
[123:36.06]Oh, dick!
[123:36.94]Come on!
[123:37.38]Goddamn.
[123:44.42]Alright, what's the play here?
[123:47.22]Is it time to try to kill them?
[123:55.25]Do I even have a play?
[123:56.31]I just woke that guy up.
[124:00.55]Right in the head.
[124:01.85]Run away.
[124:02.65]That should have been in the head.
[124:09.30]God damn it.
[124:10.96]He missed too, it's okay.
[124:14.32]Just walk into the sky again.
[124:20.58]Don't need a bandage.
[124:21.20]I'm going to take the healing item again.
[124:22.96]And then I'm going to go for... I'm going to try to kill them.
[124:29.42]Uh, what do you say?
[124:30.80]Let's do it.
[124:33.34]Heal.
[124:34.26]Pull out the weapon.
[124:34.92]Wait, can I not heal more than 50%?
[124:37.57]No, I can.
[124:39.15]Just don't get shot by the fucking arrow.
[124:40.55]Alright.
[124:42.07]Just going to wait until he heals.
[124:45.35]And then we're going to go... We're going to actually play and then kill them.
[124:48.23]This has been fun.
[124:50.64]This has been a fun little thing.
[124:52.96]But it's time to actually win.
[124:56.29]And do the mission.
[125:01.25]How's the healing?
[125:02.45]It seems to be going strong.
[125:09.17]Okay.
[125:09.75]I'm ready.
[125:10.07]This guy with the fucking bow and arrow.
[125:17.82]Just be unhittable.
[125:21.54]You serious?
[125:22.32]Are you serious?
[125:23.44]How?
[125:31.29]Now I have to bandage again.
[125:40.89]Stuck in the grass.
[125:41.67]There we go.
[125:48.12]You fucking asshole.
[125:49.58]You're the only person that can hit me.
[125:51.14]You have to die now.
[125:52.06]Alright.
[126:00.73]So far, we're okay.
[126:04.99]I need to heal again.
[126:08.45]Oh god, this is stupid.
[126:10.31]This is stupid.
[126:11.17]This is dumb.
[126:12.47]This is dumb.
[126:13.39]He's starting to get it.
[126:14.15]He's starting to get it.
[126:15.03]This guy gets it.
[126:17.62]Quickly before he gets it.
[126:34.19]He was just faking me out so bad.
[126:36.25]Oh no.
[126:38.77]I had an opportunity and I didn't take it.
[126:50.80]Oh, fuck.
[126:54.44]Why did... I thought I was gonna... I was trying to stealth kill him.
[126:57.13]You fucking stupid piece of shit.
[126:58.77]I'm dead!
[126:59.91]Jig is up.
[127:02.55]The jig is up right now.
[127:05.33]Oh, boy.
[127:05.85]Not good.
[127:08.51]The jig is actually up.
[127:12.76]Yeah, I'm dead.
[127:13.42]It's over.
[127:16.38]That was fun while it lasted.
[127:19.96]Let's go.
[127:20.48]That was fun.
[127:22.33]He just pretended to be glitched.
[127:24.15]And I hesitated.
[127:25.09]Yeah, that's it.
[127:32.71]Well, that was fun.
[127:34.77]Okay, now can I not get a game-breaking bug for a third time in a row?
[127:40.07]Let's try.
[127:45.37]No.
[127:46.77]We, in fact, cannot.
[127:50.96]I have to get off the horse.
[127:51.80]Alright.
[127:57.30]Let's, uh... Can I dress like a, like a Cuman?
[128:01.23]Or will they let me in?
[128:02.91]I don't think I have enough Cuman stuff.
[128:05.23]So what do I want to do here?
[128:15.84]Alright, my horse is just now completely broken.
[128:20.10]I can't even ride the horse anymore.
[128:22.66]Why?
[128:23.08]What the fuck is going on?
[128:27.40]Alright, let me, uh... I might need to restart the game.
[128:31.34]Because I feel like that's never going away.
[128:38.35]I have the save points right there.
[128:40.27]Hopefully it doesn't save this bug.
[128:45.49]What if I go to, like, Bribble... Bribble... What is it called?
[128:51.41]Bribble Slavitz.
[128:55.16]Maybe there's a place to go here.
[129:00.06]A foe.
[129:01.56]5% chance to evade this foe.
[129:05.76]Okay.
[129:18.49]I don't know what the hell you were thinking.
[129:24.61]What was that for?
[129:33.28]Please, guys.
[129:36.10]Don't make me have to kill you all again.
[129:38.16]Now let's go for the combo.
[129:57.11]Oh shit, I gotta be careful here.
[130:02.05]Yeah, do it.
[130:09.38]I wanna do a combo to him.
[130:10.50]At least I would like to.
[130:12.36]Alright, here we go, and uh... One!
[130:22.04]Two!
[130:23.37]No, here comes the whole fucking group again.
[130:28.53]I thought that was my dead horse.
[130:34.54]Why am I here?
[130:35.44]What the... Wait, wait, wait.
[130:37.22]Wait a second.
[130:37.86]I fast traveled and then... Now I'm back here.
[130:42.32]What?
[130:43.40]What the fuck?
[130:47.60]Oh my lord.
[130:49.90]When I fast traveled, I apparently had to go... Did I go through this camp?
[130:57.20]Oh, this...
[130:58.51]Fucking Jesus Christ.
[131:00.21]I moved 20 feet.
[131:06.94]If I hide here, can I just stay here?
[131:09.92]This is a scouting mission.
[131:11.04]Don't engage.
[131:11.64]I was trying to leave!
[131:13.12]So I could figure out what to do next!
[131:27.29]I think I'm just gonna lose and this will go the other way, because this is never gonna end.
[131:31.73]This is actually just never gonna end.
[131:45.71]No, that didn't work.
[131:50.18]Kill a guy, wear his armor.
[131:51.08]Yeah, but everyone's here now.
[131:54.10]I'm just surrounded by people.
[131:58.78]Oh boy, oh boy.
[131:59.76]Please just kill me.
[132:00.52]This is unbearable.
[132:03.00]Get me out of here.
[132:03.78]Come on.
[132:12.73]I'm just turning around and running the other direction on my fucking broken ass horse.
[132:16.95]Fucking seriously.
[132:18.21]Jesus fucking... Oh, that's so irritating.
[132:23.93]Just get me out of here.
[132:32.42]I'm about to kill the horse.
[132:49.90]Alright.
[132:50.32]Did I... Okay.
[132:59.08]I'm wanted in all these places.
[133:02.61]Where's uh, where's the meltdown counter?
[133:04.17]Well, come on like this is kind of ridiculous I want to be able to ride my horse That's taking a lot to not kill him Mmm
[133:36.09]There has to be some factor as to why that's happening.
[133:38.33]I may have bugged it for the rest of the game.
[133:41.41]I'm going to restart the game.
[133:43.35]Give me a sec.
[133:43.77]Before I get actually very angry.
[133:49.54]Coming right back.
[134:00.63]Here it comes.
[134:01.99]Please don't make this happen for the rest of the game.
[134:06.39]I'm gonna be so sad if that happens.
[134:07.95]Here it comes!
[134:28.05]Uh, halberds and spirits are glitched, you can't really use them, so don't bother.
[134:34.65]It shouldn't even be equipped right now.
[134:37.91]What's going on?
[134:40.17]Here we go.
[134:47.22]Did he ever beat Harvester?
[134:48.52]I did.
[134:50.60]I did beat Harvester.
[134:52.62]That was a crazy, wild, fun, insane game.
[134:59.86]Alright.
[135:00.32]Is this still fucked up?
[135:03.98]Yes, it is.
[135:04.34]Alright.
[135:07.12]Someone's saying drop the halberd.
[135:21.51]What is the halberd?
[135:23.99]This is it right here, right?
[135:26.58]Isn't that the thing I had on the horse?
[135:28.56]Alright.
[135:30.70]Did that work?
[135:34.16]No.
[135:41.92]Hmm.
[135:47.10]You can't keep it in your inventory.
[135:48.32]I mean, I don't have it anymore, though.
[135:54.07]What about, like, the horse?
[135:56.07]Kill the horse.
[135:57.81]Drop it by equipping your sword.
[136:04.84]Man, I don't have anything equipped right now.
[136:14.87]Oh, it's still fucked up.
[136:18.65]Shit!
[136:24.33]I don't want to go back to an old save.
[136:25.84]I'm gonna have to go back, like, two hours in the game.
[136:28.16]An hour in the game.
[136:29.76]Try to respawn and despawn a horse.
[136:31.10]Maybe there's something wrong with the saddle?
[136:34.71]Does the horse have anything?
[136:35.77]What about this shit?
[136:36.35]Like, let me drop this stuff from the horse.
[136:40.13]Just to see.
[136:41.03]Just drop all the weapons.
[136:46.02]Because this all happened after I... I mean, was it happening before?
[136:48.88]I'm gonna despawn the horse after this.
[137:06.81]So it's not the weapons.
[137:11.55]Install it.
[137:15.03]Horse broken.
[137:15.77]Ask for a refund.
[137:17.17]Fast travel and call horse.
[137:24.92]Reconnect the controller?
[137:27.90]Let me try this.
[137:28.74]Let me try to fast travel and call the horse.
[137:33.23]Let me... I'm like overburdened right now.
[137:35.15]Where the hell am I even gonna go?
[137:36.51]I better not go through the camp.
[137:41.65]Um... Ravna?
[137:47.26]I'm overloaded.
[137:49.94]I'm overloaded.
[137:50.84]I gotta move all this shit back to the horse.
[137:58.17]Time to walk.
[138:01.41]Maybe.
[138:01.63]Maybe.
[138:04.76]You... What the?
[138:06.64]Wait, what the?
[138:07.00]What's going on?
[138:07.38]What's going on?
[138:07.76]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[138:08.52]Why am I going?
[138:09.30]No!
[138:11.76]Holy shit, it worked.
[138:17.46]Wow!
[138:18.64]I actually made it through the camp.
[138:21.38]That was a 5% chance to work.
[138:28.44]Alright, that... Horse, get over here.
[138:35.66]What are you doing?
[138:36.22]Alright, he's been called.
[138:41.77]Yeah!
[138:42.37]Alright, unplug controller.
[138:46.21]Use mouse.
[138:47.77]Plug controller back in.
[138:56.49]Um...
[139:04.28]Okay.
[139:05.82]I think we may have come to a stopping point in the game.
[139:20.75]Try closing re- I already closed and reopened the game.
[139:24.53]I've already reloaded the save.
[139:26.43]I've fast traveled, I've despawned the horse.
[139:28.50]The horse is now despawned completely, let's spawn him again.
[139:32.71]How are you?
[139:33.11]Please work now.
[139:38.03]No.
[139:40.87]It might be time to put down the horse.
[139:44.66]It's the controller.
[139:45.46]I mean, I unplugged the controller.
[139:48.48]Okay, the controller is now unplugged.
[139:54.18]Controller unplugged.
[139:56.32]Get on the horse.
[140:03.22]What a bumpy fucking ride!
[140:04.82]I think I need a new time to turn pebbles into glue.
[140:11.84]Unplug the horse and plug it back in.
[140:16.73]It's the mouse?
[140:17.91]Definitely not the mouse.
[140:21.95]I might have to go back to an old save but I'm not gonna do that because that's like a full almost like hour and a half before.
[140:32.55]Okay.
[140:35.57]It's really... Try another horse.
[140:37.94]Let's go steal a horse.
[140:40.36]Is there a horse anywhere in this big pasture?
[140:42.14]I need to find a random horse.
[140:55.53]I'm gonna get arrested for this.
[141:02.25]New horse.
[141:07.33]Upgrade the horse drivers.
[141:11.33]Hold on, let me just get my controller plugged back in because that's probably not the problem.
[141:18.53]What the fuck is this?
[141:20.85]Oh, wrong thing.
[141:25.09]The game saves when you sleep.
[141:27.81]Let me see what the last save was before that.
[141:36.65]Uh, it's almost like a full hour behind.
[141:39.85]I don't know if I want to do that.
[141:49.43]It's about like 40 minutes behind, which that sucks.
[141:55.56]I could do it and we could see once and for all if it's actually that
[142:03.11]It's not worth it.
[142:03.85]I mean, long term it might be.
[142:08.20]That might long term be worth it.
[142:10.02]Yeah, I can't.
[142:15.66]That's going to make me throw up.
[142:16.68]I can't even be on it.
[142:18.41]Sleep and then try to... Okay, I'm going to... This is fast travel.
[142:24.55]If you steal a horse, does it do the same camera bug?
[142:26.57]I'm not sure.
[142:28.41]We're trying to... We're trying to see...
[142:32.68]Where's, like, the quickest place for me to get a horse for free?
[142:37.06]Or let me, like, sleep.
[142:39.42]I'm just gonna sleep in some random person's bed.
[142:46.78]Maybe I can... rekindle it.
[142:52.49]Your horse is just following you.
[142:54.59]Well, I mean, I think the whole game might be fucked up because we were in the air.
[143:00.65]You know what I mean?
[143:02.19]We were walking around in the air.
[143:04.91]People were fighting each other.
[143:06.17]There was random PvP that we weren't even a part of.
[143:09.60]So, I have no idea.
[143:10.90]The whole game might be busted now.
[143:12.08]Let's see what happens.
[143:28.50]Merhojed has a horse, um...
[143:33.71]Merhojed.
[143:34.33]Now, game saved.
[143:36.95]Here.
[143:39.74]Maybe getting a new save file.
[143:43.20]Sleeping.
[143:44.46]All the above.
[143:45.02]No.
[143:52.00]Go validate your Steam files.
[143:53.87]Fuck, do I really have to do that?
[143:54.99]Alright, where... Let's go here.
[143:58.04]I mean, I could go back to... I don't want to progress until I can figure out if this is something I have to deal with permanently.
[144:06.32]I don't want to deal with a Wayfarer.
[144:07.50]I don't care.
[144:13.30]You have to get a new horse?
[144:16.75]That's... Why?
[144:20.37]Why do I need to do that?
[144:26.05]Where's the horse vendor?
[144:34.00]Where's the one that sells horses?
[144:38.42]Unexplored place.
[144:47.35]Go to the horse dealership.
[144:51.70]Take the saddle off and put it back on.
[144:53.20]Can you even do that?
[144:55.62]This is a garden.
[145:07.11]40 minutes were you being a seagull.
[145:09.03]I mean, that was fun.
[145:09.83]Maybe there's like a console command.
[145:13.29]Does the horse have like a random... Hold on, let's just... The game is saved.
[145:24.34]I don't even give a shit.
[145:27.38]New horse.
[145:34.50]You've committed a crime and I'm arresting you.
[145:37.20]Oh no, I've committed a crime!
[145:38.74]Shit!
[145:40.42]Hmm, what can I say about that?
[145:57.62]Spawn horse with the console.
[145:59.76]No, I'm going to reload that save.
[146:01.14]I think my whole game is broken forever, unless I go back 30 or 40 minutes.
[146:14.22]We might have to do this.
[146:18.76]As much as I don't want to, I just want to see if it's broken forever.
[146:23.56]We have to go back...
[146:25.97]Okay, reloading the save I don't think is going to cause... These will still be here, right?
[146:36.57]Just because I go back like 40 minutes doesn't mean that these will disappear, right?
[146:41.23]Should be okay.
[146:47.00]I hope so.
[146:52.56]Here we go.
[146:59.43]Reinstall the game.
[147:00.45]Do you need to ride a horse?
[147:02.85]I need to... I think this is gonna fix it.
[147:07.27]If this doesn't fix it, then... I have a major problem with my game files, apparently.
[147:17.31]And... 3... 2... 1... It's... fixed!
[147:24.15]Hey!
[147:25.67]I just had to go back like an hour in game time!
[147:34.86]This is a long time ago, though.
[147:41.91]How long ago is this?
[147:46.87]This is going- This is- I got a bunch of- Is this before I got the cool sword?
[147:53.55]I gotta go be a seagull again.
[147:54.77]I don't know.
[147:56.45]It's 40 minutes of me, like, dropping shit and I still have this.
[147:59.19]It's not that far.
[148:02.87]Let me just go pee.
[148:05.33]That's fairly annoying, but whatever.
[148:07.09]It's not catastrophic.
[148:08.24]Let me pee and I'll be right back.
[148:37.95]Wait, what?
[150:51.78]Do you think it's worth trying reloading the current save?
[150:57.92]Just to see if it fixed it.
[150:59.41]If it kind of bumped it out of existence.
[151:02.61]I'm willing to try.
[151:03.23]I'm going to try it.
[151:10.18]Just see what happens.
[151:25.43]And... Come on.
[151:27.20]I like bumped it out.
[151:28.36]I fixed it.
[151:29.56]Yeah, there we go.
[151:30.22]Bingo.
[151:32.58]We're good.
[151:35.40]I had to like go make sure the game understood where people are supposed to be and now it worked.
[151:40.93]We don't have to do the whole thing over again.
[151:44.35]Great.
[151:45.33]I'm happy about that.
[151:46.29]Excellent.
[151:48.29]Excellent.
[151:48.88]So.
[151:50.32]I actually am...
[151:53.65]going to get a new horse because I got some money.
[151:58.39]And if I, you know, I want to see how much it is.
[152:01.21]We have to go down here anyways.
[152:07.06]I'll ignore.
[152:14.70]The devs patched the game while you were peeing.
[152:22.53]That would be weird if they did.
[152:26.66]Let's go talk to the horse vendor.
[152:33.24]We're going to eat this horse.
[152:34.72]The one that I currently have.
[152:38.41]Can you do that?
[152:41.65]Where are the stables?
[152:45.21]I just did this and I already forgot.
[152:48.35]It's down here, right?
[152:56.41]Yeah, we're gonna eat this guy.
[152:57.14]I'm gonna carve him up, and we're gonna make him into stew.
[153:04.46]Yeah, I'm just gonna get off the horse, because... I mean, I can walk around easier than ride this fucking thing.
[153:14.57]Okay, I see a horse.
[153:16.21]Where's Mr. Horse Vendor?
[153:17.75]I mean, this guy's way better at everything, except for capacity.
[153:28.74]Horse vendor?
[153:34.02]Guy that sells these?
[153:35.30]Where you at?
[153:40.98]Horse trader.
[153:47.46]He's not at his shop window.
[153:57.38]Down here?
[154:05.98]Maybe he's wandering around?
[154:19.99]He's in the barn.
[154:25.43]Hello?
[154:31.77]Hello?
[154:39.29]You in the outhouse?
[154:44.49]I am the horse fender.
[154:50.16]No, that's not him.
[154:50.68]That's a guard.
[154:54.89]Just steal it?
[154:56.39]I might.
[154:59.31]Are you the horse fender?
[155:02.19]Good day.
[155:05.57]I'd like to buy a horse.
[155:06.41]Um, I have.
[155:08.27]Uh... I'll take the sneeze horse.
[155:09.75]Tier 3?
[155:38.33]What about a trade-in?
[155:40.39]That's too much money.
[156:09.71]No deal.
[156:13.51]Maybe some other?
[156:14.21]I don't think we can afford him.
[156:17.67]What about Roach?
[156:18.93]She's a pretty good horse.
[156:20.87]She's got a mind of her own.
[156:22.11]I bought her from some old Polish fella.
[156:25.93]He said, now he's settled down with her.
[156:27.59]We're going to have to buy Roach.
[156:29.66]Alright.
[156:35.26]Surely you'll knock something off the price if I trade in my old one.
[156:44.24]Oh boy, okay.
[157:02.07]Fuck.
[157:05.05]That's too much money.
[157:06.09]I'm stealing it.
[157:07.55]I'm just never coming back to this place ever again.
[157:15.35]What do you mean, am I stupid?
[157:18.93]I'm not gonna buy a horse for $1500.
[157:23.78]I'm just gonna steal the tier 5.
[157:28.00]Steal the horse and then leave.
[157:28.94]Wait, actually, yeah.
[157:33.09]Which one's Jenda?
[157:38.51]I'll never come back here ever again.
[157:39.57]There's Jenda right there.
[157:41.57]Oh, wow.
[157:42.13]Okay, yeah.
[157:42.81]I'm absolutely stealing this.
[157:44.42]Why wouldn't I?
[157:45.34]It's free.
[157:48.40]This is a free horse.
[157:49.72]That's it.
[157:52.80]This is the... Look at this.
[157:54.46]Are you kidding me?
[157:55.16]What do you mean it's not free?
[158:02.31]I'll show you free.
[158:05.11]Let's first... First of all, let's make it so we can...
[158:09.26]We're going to go over here.
[158:10.48]We're going to go to Sir Radzig.
[158:17.07]No, I'm going to wait this out.
[158:20.15]Taking this free horse.
[158:24.31]I'm sitting right here.
[158:25.05]I'm going to fucking hide in the barn until they close it.
[158:30.07]Maybe you can't keep it.
[158:36.07]You can't call it.
[158:38.60]You can't call horses you steal.
[158:43.32]You can't use the inventory... God, really?
[158:49.40]Yeah, I'll have to buy it.
[158:54.56]Okay.
[158:57.70]I guess I'll stick with my shitty horse.
[159:06.16]Sell everything and buy agenda.
[159:08.86]I can't afford Jenda.
[159:11.23]She's too expensive.
[159:15.67]Let's just go to the mission.
[159:17.91]Let's go to Radzig and tell them what happened.
[159:21.33]Tattletail on the bad guys.
[159:28.88]Kill Pebbles for insurance money.
[159:35.02]Buy the horse, then kill Guy.
[159:39.38]I don't know if that's gonna work.
[159:42.10]Am I gonna be able to get my $1500 back?
[159:47.10]Let's say I buy Jenda and kill him immediately after the sale has gone through.
[159:51.04]Is it gonna have, like, two grand on him?
[159:54.40]I would think not.
[160:03.02]Hi.
[160:04.62]God bless you.
[160:05.66]What troubles you?
[160:08.00]I'm back from scouting, sir.
[160:10.14]Ooh, what did you find?
[160:11.14]What have you found out?
[160:18.24]I tried to count them.
[160:20.56]And how many of them are there?
[160:22.48]Oh, shit.
[160:24.74]We'll have to call for reinforcements.
[160:26.62]Okay, there's a lot.
[160:28.06]Every man that comes with us will be lacking somewhere else.
[160:31.00]And I don't want bandits... It's at least ten.
[160:33.31]...because there's no one left to mount a defense.
[160:37.57]There's quite a few.
[160:40.31]Hardly worth mentioning.
[160:41.75]Should I just send him to his death?
[160:44.82]There was a lot.
[160:52.12]At least ten of them were following me.
[160:58.62]That is not many.
[160:59.64]You're fine.
[161:00.16]There's a lot of them.
[161:01.84]I couldn't even count them all.
[161:03.41]Christ.
[161:04.57]We'll have to gather armed forces from the whole region to defeat them.
[161:10.58]Wait, hold on.
[161:11.86]Does that mean there was like a thousand?
[161:14.09]You don't need to call all the banners of every town.
[161:25.45]To get like a camp of bandits.
[161:27.37]Imagine just them all trotting in like 5,000 men and there's like 14 people here.
[161:44.02]I took a look at their arms and armor.
[161:46.14]They're not a proper army, but they're equipped quite well.
[161:48.29]What about archers?
[161:50.61]Call the banners.
[161:52.63]Yeah, they're positioned well.
[161:54.53]There's a few of them, and they're positioned well.
[161:56.91]If we charge them head-on, they'll probably do us a lot of damage.
[162:00.59]I don't like the sound of that.
[162:02.32]It complicates the situation.
[162:04.90]I'm making it sound like it's a war.
[162:09.78]It's mostly bandits in the camp.
[162:12.06]They're not villagers with pitchforks, but not regular... Wait, that's not true.
[162:14.88]What?
[162:15.34]I don't know more than I expected.
[162:16.66]I have no fear of them.
[162:18.50]But underestimating the enemy can be fatal.
[162:22.80]There's an overgrown, ruined village in the woods where they're dug in.
[162:26.02]That sounds like Privislovitz.
[162:27.84]It used to belong to Sir Divish.
[162:29.30]Actually, that place was pretty big.
[162:31.58]And then imprisoned Divish.
[162:33.02]Yeah.
[162:33.48]It's been left abandoned ever since.
[162:35.46]I was hoping they wouldn't be so organized.
[162:38.00]Earthworks and fortifications...
[162:40.01]That's quite a different matter from writing some rabble out of the woods.
[162:45.84]That's about all I saw, sir.
[162:47.56]I didn't notice anything else.
[162:49.00]That's alright.
[162:50.34]Did you manage any sabotage while you were there, as I asked you?
[162:53.16]Uh, well, so no, sir.
[162:54.44]The game actually sabotaged me.
[162:56.82]You did a good job anyway, and you deserve a reward.
[163:00.52]But now we must get ready to set out as soon as possible and put an end to them.
[163:04.89]I need you to go to Sir Divish in Talmberg and tell him to send Captain Robard and his men to our aid.
[163:10.87]There's not enough of us here in the camp.
[163:12.89]You can rely on me, sir.
[163:14.32]What should I tell him?
[163:15.32]I'm gonna get arrested when I go here.
[163:16.16]Tell Sir Robard to bring all his men, leaving only a minimum guard at the castle.
[163:20.84]And to send a message to Sir Hanush to send his men too.
[163:24.87]Group of bandits mobbed by entire country.
[163:26.35]Is that his weapon?
[163:27.93]Holy shit, that is nice.
[163:29.69]Can I take it?
[163:30.09]He won't even see it.
[163:30.81]That is such a beautiful sword.
[163:58.20]Why can I not steal this?
[164:02.14]Whatever.
[164:05.42]Alright, I'm currently wanted in the town that I'm about to go to.
[164:08.59]So it looks like we're going to have to pay up.
[164:29.30]Foe.
[164:34.11]Foe.
[164:34.47]I love how I'm just... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[164:42.03]You murdered somebody.
[164:43.37]You murder.
[164:43.95]Wait.
[164:44.55]Oh, no.
[164:45.22]God damn it.
[165:01.44]I'm gonna miss the attack.
[165:12.66]Henry's here!
[165:13.78]Oh, everybody loves Henry!
[165:18.10]What is his... Are you pulling my piss off?
[165:25.21]Don't you know who I am?
[165:27.06]You better watch your step, or I'll make things so hot for you, you'll be lucky to get a job slopping out piss pots.
[165:33.37]Aye, right.
[165:34.23]I've gone all weak at the knees.
[165:48.46]What do you lose when you get... Do you actually lose anything by going to jail, or is it just time?
[165:56.81]I can't flee.
[165:57.61]I need to come here to talk to somebody.
[166:03.86]Can I still talk to him?
[166:15.74]I need to get in and just do the quest.
[166:17.74]Have the quest happen.
[166:19.32]That's all that has to happen here.
[166:25.00]He's up here.
[166:29.43]I tripped over a fucking rock.
[166:31.59]Get the fuck... Straight over here.
[166:49.45]Wait, which house is he in?
[166:57.43]Which one?
[167:00.82]Is he in this one?
[167:01.96]He's up here, right?
[167:03.08]Where?
[167:03.34]Which one?
[167:03.94]Which door?
[167:04.62]Right in here?
[167:05.52]Where is he?
[167:05.84]Where is he?
[167:13.79]Hey, hey, hey.
[167:14.63]Wait, wait, wait.
[167:17.01]Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up.
[167:25.98]Got you, you scum.
[167:28.19]And now you'll pay for the murder you committed.
[167:30.87]Next floor.
[167:31.31]Personally, I'd rather string you up.
[167:33.67]But I'm... You in jail.
[167:37.27]Just give me a little bit of time.
[167:38.33]Okay, here we go.
[167:41.27]Out the door.
[167:41.95]Don't move.
[167:43.89]Don't move a muscle.
[167:47.17]What's going on?
[167:47.59]Got you, you scum.
[167:50.27]Personally...
[168:03.14]Where is he?
[168:03.54]Ow!
[168:06.60]He just clipped me through the wall.
[168:14.89]There he is.
[168:15.87]Hey!
[168:16.69]Hey!
[168:18.63]Excuse me!
[168:21.00]No, don't run away.
[168:25.32]I have to hide.
[168:30.24]Don't run from me.
[168:30.92]I need to talk to you.
[168:41.67]He's so fast.
[168:44.47]Oh my God.
[168:45.21]Why are you this fast?
[168:52.86]He's running.
[168:53.28]Okay, this is perfect.
[168:54.20]He's running out of the castle.
[168:56.46]Good?
[168:59.65]Go just get out so then we can finally have a conversation.
[169:07.31]I just gotta get away.
[169:08.15]There he is.
[169:08.45]Why is he running so far away?
[169:15.48]Okay.
[169:16.86]All I need to do now is I need to kill the guard behind me.
[169:26.18]Stop locking onto him.
[169:31.12]Tackle him.
[169:33.90]I'm gonna lose him in the grass.
[169:34.90]Ah, this is so irritating.
[169:44.30]Like, honest to god, one fucking guy follows you and he's just glued to your back.
[169:52.50]He's just glued to my back.
[169:56.65]I don't want to lose him.
[169:58.19]Okay, now I have to fucking, like, this shit is so annoying.
[170:00.90]Like, one fucking guy follows me out.
[170:02.44]You're dead.
[170:04.20]Why do I not have a weapon equipped?
[170:09.92]Give me a fucking break.
[170:13.86]Take the weapon out.
[170:15.28]Why won't you take out the weapon?
[170:16.66]Why is my... Take out the fucking weapon!
[170:20.48]Take out the weapon!
[170:21.79]No!
[170:22.43]What are you doing?! !
[170:26.39]Why is this game like this?
[170:27.76]I couldn't swing.
[170:35.64]It wasn't already out.
[170:36.49]I could not swing the sword.
[170:44.25]I had nothing in my hands.
[170:59.52]Well, how come when I was swinging I couldn't swing even when I was not crouching?
[171:02.70]What a pain in the ass.
[171:05.76]Alright, I want to show you something.
[171:09.50]So, I had the weapon out.
[171:11.62]No, I don't have any weapon equipped again.
[171:13.78]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[171:14.58]I remember, I had to unequip all my weapons because the game was uncompletably broken until I had to go back and really like, I like threw all my gear on the ground.
[171:24.74]That's why I didn't have a fucking weapon in my hand.
[171:29.44]But let's forget that, though!
[171:30.48]Alright, so look.
[171:36.73]I'm crouching right now.
[171:38.25]R1.
[171:39.23]Crouching.
[171:40.43]I'm crouched!
[171:40.95]Crouch!
[171:41.35]R2.
[171:42.77]Huh?
[171:43.73]Excuse me.
[171:44.09]He's gonna bury my face in shit.
[172:13.65]Serve your jail time.
[172:15.91]We're gonna go serve jail time now.
[172:18.00]That would have worked too.
[172:19.20]That's the one terrible part.
[172:20.94]The one guard that follows me outside, like a mile outside the castle, who is glued to your back.
[172:40.47]I have to do this fucking shit again.
[172:55.65]Christ all fucking mighty.
[173:11.12]Did you try telling me you are a secret mission?
[173:12.60]Yeah, it didn't matter.
[173:15.18]Pay for the horse, kill the guard.
[173:19.61]What's going on here?
[173:20.17]Give me my horse.
[173:31.01]No, I can't go that way.
[173:31.79]I can't jump over this fence.
[173:42.63]You can barely catch an old man.
[173:56.93]I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go... No, no.
[173:58.47]I should just serve the jail time first.
[174:00.63]Right?
[174:01.15]Shouldn't I do that?
[174:03.69]I probably should just go serve the jail time now.
[174:05.70]Go... Go... Where was it?
[174:07.40]Where was... I don't even know where I need to go.
[174:10.44]Was it... Which town am I wanted in that I need to go to?
[174:18.83]It was Thalmberg, right?
[174:22.01]Let's go get... Let's go get arrested and go sit in jail.
[174:44.00]I would love to serve jail time.
[174:48.06]I agree.
[174:48.48]I'm a terrible fucking person.
[174:52.63]You want it in all the cities.
[175:00.58]You can't complete the game unless you serve the time.
[175:16.78]It's only a week, don't worry.
[175:17.94]We'll be fine.
[175:18.45]Make sure you don't hit tab.
[175:39.95]They really do make you sit here.
[175:46.60]Don't do the crime if you won't eat the slime This is exciting
[176:24.88]I wish there was a jail minigame you could play while you do this.
[176:28.62]I can't, like, click around and pop some bubbles or something?
[176:38.32]Alright.
[176:38.92]I've committed the time.
[176:40.07]I've committed the crime.
[176:41.39]Thank you.
[176:41.79]Bye.
[176:42.15]Now let's go back.
[176:52.93]Okay, I've served my time in jail.
[176:55.59]I can't travel.
[176:56.33]I'm too overloaded, apparently.
[176:59.44]How?
[177:02.24]Why am I overloaded?
[177:06.70]I lost stats or something?
[177:13.95]I'm 35.
[177:14.29]I gotta lose some stuff here.
[177:15.91]I don't need two of these.
[177:22.61]I can probably get away with this.
[177:24.13]Yeah.
[177:32.31]Let's go.
[177:40.62]I'm not going to punch somebody and end up in jail.
[177:42.12]I'm not doing it.
[177:50.52]Now I need the better horse to make up for the lost stats.
[178:00.48]Alright, let's go do the mission again.
[178:02.38]I wanna like... I don't even know.
[178:10.22]Howdy doody.
[178:26.84]I'm ready.
[178:27.36]Let's scout the place again.
[178:33.32]Ah, thank god.
[178:33.94]Alright, tell me what to do.
[178:47.20]Free soup, right?
[178:48.10]I'm one of the people that live here and work here.
[178:59.02]Let's try to get through this fast.
[179:00.12]Because we already did it.
[179:05.56]I don't even have the decency to turn around and talk to me.
[179:14.47]I tried to count them.
[179:17.01]There's a lot of them.
[179:18.77]We don't get to rewind.
[179:23.45]They're in overgrown ruins.
[179:25.31]We don't get to redo.
[179:26.91]It's mostly bandits.
[179:30.11]Yeah, they're positioned well.
[179:33.20]That's it.
[179:33.60]Alright.
[179:33.84]Be quick.
[179:34.70]Alright, back to Talberg.
[179:36.70]Thank you.
[179:37.02]See you soon.
[180:00.06]If I get arrested here again, I'm going to be very, very angry.
[180:05.44]Peasants don't deserve eye contact.
[180:18.99]Foe.
[180:22.37]Arrest this man.
[180:23.27]Alright, looking forward to it.
[180:33.42]I'm gonna sleep in the bed first.
[180:34.52]Because I want the game to save here.
[180:41.21]I didn't sabotage.
[180:42.03]Where's my bed?
[180:51.03]Open.
[180:53.83]Sit.
[180:54.65]Sleep for ten minutes.
[180:59.75]Just take a nap.
[181:12.89]Is this game based on Monty Python and we just don't know it yet?
[181:17.98]There we are.
[181:24.22]Now let's... I thought I was stuck in the house again.
[181:29.84]I was about to be... livid.
[181:41.39]Damn.
[181:42.27]Move!
[181:42.65]Move it or lose it!
[181:46.19]Which one is he in?
[181:46.79]This one?
[181:47.81]No, he's in the next one, right?
[181:53.59]No, you're on the same... You're in the place that he usually is.
[181:56.82]I think he's outside.
[182:00.14]Where the fuck did he go?
[182:11.11]He's moving around.
[182:13.06]I'm tracking his movements.
[182:23.04]Ah, there you are.
[182:26.10]Callie, talk.
[182:28.74]He's running through the fields.
[182:33.14]Sir Radzig sent me with an important message.
[182:35.38]He asked for reinforcements.
[182:37.22]He needs more men?
[182:38.78]What's going on?
[182:39.64]There is an absolute... It's serious.
[182:44.96]Sir Radzig wants to mount an assault on them, but he doesn't have enough men.
[182:48.43]No, I don't want to tell you the whole story.
[182:52.09]Thanks, Grandpa.
[183:15.59]I can't wait to steamroll this.
[183:16.97]We need everybody we can.
[183:18.29]Don't you understand?
[183:18.81]There are 14 guys there.
[183:45.12]Should we leave?
[183:45.60]I have to get ready first.
[183:47.60]I'm ready.
[183:50.32]I want to make sure I have items.
[183:58.95]Because if this is like a big battle, I need to be ready.
[184:10.55]I've got to sell stuff.
[184:11.91]I've got to be prepared for this.
[184:15.90]We need to go... What do I have for, like... The horse has a ton of shit, too.
[184:20.20]Alright, we need to make this happen.
[184:23.28]Uh, here's the combat arena.
[184:26.54]Is there a... I don't think there's, like, a blacksmith or anything here.
[184:29.44]I mean, what about down here?
[184:33.95]Have I ever gone over here?
[184:34.75]I don't think I've ever been in this direction before.
[184:52.95]There's got to be some trading people down here, right?
[185:00.72]What's going on with this person?
[185:05.22]Why is there a dead villager on the ground?
[185:06.74]Okay.
[185:11.34]I don't want to get involved.
[185:19.43]Anything?
[185:20.65]Somebody selling stuff?
[185:22.01]Lodgings?
[185:25.45]There's probably a traitor here, but... I guess I have to go somewhere else.
[185:33.60]I think you shot her.
[185:34.36]No, I didn't.
[185:34.74]I didn't shoot anybody.
[185:41.10]Is there a blacksmith in Talberg, or do I have to go to, like, Užit's or something?
[185:51.34]There has to be somebody here.
[185:52.28]Right?
[185:57.88]I don't see any armorsmith or anything.
[186:09.24]Ratte.
[186:09.64]I'm going to go all the way back to Ratte.
[186:16.75]Northwest of Talenberg.
[186:18.11]What, like Ravina?
[186:21.61]There's nothing here, I don't think.
[186:24.71]That's a long way to go.
[186:25.83]I mean, Scallots, right?
[186:29.55]Scallops has somebody, don't they?
[186:35.11]Shit.
[186:38.63]What over here?
[186:45.10]There's a barber here.
[186:46.70]There's a blacksmith here.
[186:50.82]Don't have to go that far.
[186:52.94]I'm not wanted here, right?
[186:58.10]No, people don't like me there.
[187:03.59]Skeletons just burnt to the ground.
[187:05.55]We're just gonna go back to Ratte.
[187:09.17]Temporarily.
[187:10.55]Let's go.
[187:16.64]Because there's a couple other things I want to do here.
[187:22.26]Probably going to- I'm probably going here for no reason.
[187:30.64]At least we get to watch the fun walking animation, though.
[187:39.65]Is the audio gone?
[187:40.57]It shouldn't be.
[187:47.37]Ignore.
[187:47.71]I don't want to talk to that guy.
[187:53.13]I had a happy face here.
[187:54.11]People like me here, right?
[187:59.14]Good day.
[188:04.59]Alright.
[188:06.23]Sell.
[188:06.79]I want to buy save potions.
[188:08.99]I want to get like actual regular potions.
[188:14.63]Let's dump a bunch of the stuff that I have here.
[188:16.52]Even though it's stolen, some of it is.
[188:18.04]Let's see what this guy wants to do.
[188:25.72]Trade.
[188:28.60]Alright.
[188:31.24]Let me go to the horse.
[188:33.04]Let me pull all the shit from the horse.
[188:38.67]This is not stolen, not stolen, not stolen.
[188:41.71]That's a lot of stuff.
[188:50.49]Go to the armorer.
[188:56.75]It's stolen, but it's not stolen anymore.
[189:00.52]Talk.
[189:00.82]No, don't steal.
[189:01.78]Talk.
[189:06.31]So, alright, here we go.
[189:07.73]So, let's add the axe.
[189:09.92]I'm not going to use these.
[189:10.74]I'm not going to use a shield.
[189:15.02]I'm not going to use a mace.
[189:20.80]I have a really good sword.
[189:26.16]Get enough for the best horse.
[189:30.30]I feel like I should hold on to this.
[189:39.05]I should keep a blunt weapon.
[189:43.12]Maybe I will.
[189:46.92]Yeah, I'll keep the Morningstar.
[189:52.87]But that's 157.
[189:54.01]I'll hold the shield.
[189:57.57]Okay, wait.
[190:02.15]What's going on here?
[190:02.77]Okay, basket.
[190:04.30]Haggle.
[190:09.35]Let's have a word about the price.
[190:13.61]Price.
[190:14.87]I'm going to sneeze at his mouth.
[190:17.49]Is this enough?
[190:19.81]That sounds pretty interesting.
[190:21.19]A little less and I'll be satisfied.
[190:26.49]I'll go for that.
[190:32.70]What is this?
[190:33.08]Sharpening wheel?
[190:38.79]Position angle pressure pedal.
[190:41.09]What?
[190:43.33]If you want to maintain bladed weapons, you can save your repair kit and hone it yourself on a grindstone, which you can find at every smithy.
[190:49.65]Just approach the grindstone, start the process, and select from the list which weapon you want to hone.
[190:54.75]The weapon must be honed along the whole length of the blade.
[190:57.63]You select which part using R. Okay.
[191:09.04]Um... Nope!
[191:17.92]Nope!
[191:21.82]Don't need to do it.
[191:24.73]It's been fun.
[191:29.39]Now let's go to the armorer.
[191:38.97]How are you?
[191:39.37]Do I have any armor on me that I can give you?
[191:46.90]Alright.
[191:47.36]What do we got?
[191:51.18]Nothing.
[191:51.48]I have to get her off the horse.
[191:59.71]Look at all this stuff.
[192:05.11]It's so heavy!
[192:09.26]That might be more complicated than honing an actual sword.
[192:14.07]So, we got... Add to basket.
[192:16.25]Chainmail.
[192:18.77]Uh, the... Human helmet.
[192:21.21]Yeah.
[192:22.59]Punches, gloves.
[192:23.79]What do I... Kettle hat.
[192:24.56]What do I got for a hat now?
[192:31.06]What do I got for a hat now?
[192:36.70]Get rid of this fucking thing.
[192:37.52]It's worse.
[192:40.41]And the old cumin helmet.
[192:43.45]Two-piece kettle hat.
[192:44.59]What's worse?
[192:45.71]Skull cap.
[192:47.71]Where's that old cumin helmet?
[192:50.03]There it is.
[192:58.26]Selling the shitty vambraces.
[192:59.66]What do I have for vambracers?
[193:01.24]I'll sell them these two.
[193:04.26]Two-piece kettle hat.
[193:05.08]Get rid of it.
[193:08.15]What do I got if I get rid of the leather gloves?
[193:10.33]Mail coif.
[193:11.95]This one's 12.
[193:12.43]What do I have right now?
[193:16.16]I have like a different one, right?
[193:22.70]12.
[193:22.72]100.
[193:22.74]This one is 12.
[193:24.80]100.
[193:24.86]They're both good.
[193:26.25]I'll just get rid of it.
[193:27.67]Get the money.
[193:28.09]Get rid of the collar.
[193:31.41]Get rid of the dumb noble shoes.
[193:38.15]Mmm, what do I do?
[193:40.32]Riding Blue's Riveted Gloves.
[193:43.04]Give him these ones.
[193:47.64]Get rid of this, because I have this.
[193:49.94]Uh-huh.
[193:52.06]I'm gonna repair this, because it's better than what I have on, right?
[193:58.18]Yeah, I have Chainmail.
[194:02.44]Sell him the Chainmail.
[194:04.87]And then repair this.
[194:10.17]Looks good.
[194:14.15]Seal the deal.
[194:16.07]I'd like to discuss the prop.
[194:17.79]Sure.
[194:18.19]Ooh, baby.
[194:21.85]550.
[194:22.59]Satisfied?
[194:23.15]A nice sum.
[194:26.59]Just lower your demands a little and we'll agree.
[194:32.16]Alright.
[194:33.60]And now?
[194:34.59]Aw.
[194:34.71]$520.
[194:34.73]That's a good sum.

[197:53.02]Could put on the ring.
[197:56.63]Get more charisma.
[198:00.75]No.
[198:00.97]Let's go trade the food and get potions.
[198:06.83]And the question is...
[198:09.19]Where do I buy potions?
[198:15.37]Sell.
[198:20.89]I have a lot of junk.
[198:23.49]These are all rotten.
[198:31.14]Take all my gross salami.
[198:35.64]That's fine.
[198:36.22]I don't even care.
[198:36.96]I don't need to haggle.
[198:39.53]Gotta go to the apothecary.
[198:44.32]Mr. Potion Man, where are you?
[198:48.14]Why?

[199:16.57]Do I want... Do I want a weapon?
[199:19.79]I feel like I... Is the weapon I have, like, one of the best weapons?
[199:27.80]I feel like I should sell it.
[199:29.58]Do something.
[199:30.10]I don't know.
[199:31.54]The thing I have is really good, I think.
[199:36.32]Let's wash ourselves and get a haircut.
[199:41.13]Where's the barber?
[199:48.35]Okay.
[199:48.85]I would like a haircut.
[199:55.52]What kind of shirt?
[200:00.46]It's a scarf.
[200:05.31]This is dumb.
[200:06.31]I look like a moron in this, right?
[200:08.05]That's good.
[200:08.87]That's a 1.4K!

[200:43.76]Scarf.
[200:44.28]Is there anything in the upper... You don't have anything else, do you?
[200:48.75]Check the basket.
[200:49.37]Close the door.
[200:51.23]It's alright.
[200:51.73]I just need, like, a $5 t-shirt.
[200:54.07]To not look like a moron.
[200:55.01]Alright.
[201:04.96]I've completed my look.
[201:07.66]Let's go to the potion vendor.
[201:10.70]Which he is... Right here.
[201:15.40]Still overburdened somehow.
[201:22.39]Hey!
[201:24.69]I'm not myself.
[201:29.15]Oh, get on with you.
[201:31.32]You have a good strong frame that can take a beating, so be a man.
[201:35.44]Why is that where you go to?

[202:06.00]Alright, but it'll cost you.
[202:11.40]Come on, I just gave you money.
[202:13.70]I gave you $50.
[202:14.00]I'm alright with giving you another $50.
[202:19.53]Satisfied?
[202:22.19]You won't convince me with that.
[202:27.53]Agreed.
[202:29.17]Now listen up.
[202:34.39]I've never met this guy?
[202:37.39]Have I never met this guy?
[202:39.33]Did I just get swindled and given him some money?
[202:41.19]Alright, what we got?
[202:43.59]We have... Skills Alchemy.

[202:52.03]What do I do?
[203:06.18]Okay.

[203:51.13]Chamomile.
[203:52.51]What is a healing potion?
[203:55.03]Digestion potion?
[203:56.61]Is there a potion where you don't have to go to jail anymore?
[203:58.79]You know what I'm saying?
[204:07.22]After five minutes, your health is renewed to the maximum and your hangover is cured.
[204:12.51]Yeah, where's the jailbreak potion?
[204:16.59]Within one minute, we'll cure... So there's that.
[204:21.59]Nighthawk.
[204:21.95]There's a lot of shit in this game.
[204:24.42]Oh, recipe for a potion!
[204:26.02]How much is this?
[204:27.32]Oh, no thank you.
[204:31.86]Uh, these are 33.
[204:33.34]Buy like three of them.
[204:38.58]What's the save game potion?
[204:45.22]Where's that?
[204:46.06]Can I not buy that here?
[204:46.90]There it is.

[204:59.19]Yeah, it's the save game one.
[205:06.87]Spirits is just a good vitality potion Buy a couple of these Okay, we got some healing potions we have some save potions and I have a couple of like good you're not gonna take a lot of damage potions Let's have a word about the price well we can try it Whoa That's a lot of money
[205:37.18]That's a lot.
[205:42.96]Is this worth it?
[205:49.62]That's a huge amount of money.
[205:50.98]That's like 30% of my entire health pool.
[206:09.60]I don't know.
[206:10.28]I'm going to take the only one I need.
[206:13.10]I don't need healing potions.
[206:14.08]I already have a few of them.
[206:16.54]I need the schnapps though.
[206:17.74]These are so fucking expensive.
[206:25.62]Let's get two of them.
[206:27.60]And like one of these.
[206:35.42]Let's have a word about the price.
[206:38.51]Well, that's like 30% of my entire portfolio.
[206:41.81]You can brew the schnapps for almost nothing.
[206:45.99]How do I do alchemy?
[206:50.70]Just craft them?
[206:51.26]Hold on.
[206:52.64]Do I have to do something specific to do alchemy?
[206:54.62]I just learned it, but how do I do it?
[206:56.56]Let me look at this.
[207:04.31]For instance, if I go to player...
[207:08.22]How do I brew potions?
[207:14.44]Like alchemy, how do I level this up?
[207:20.63]Go in the back?
[207:24.43]Maybe use like a little apothecary back here?
[207:40.87]Alchemy is a useful skill that transforms herbs and other ingredients into potions and remedies.
[208:01.34]In order to brew those, you need a knowledge of alchemy, a recipe, an alchemist's bench, and the ingredients.
[208:07.71]Okay.
[208:36.52]Save your schnapps is nettle and belladonna.
[208:44.91]Prepare wine, two handfuls of belladonna, and one nettle.
[208:49.51]Boil the nettles for two turns, grind the belladonna, drop in the belladonna, and boil for one more turn.
[209:00.68]I don't have any of these things.
[209:04.02]But I can do this, I can press the button.
[209:05.70]I can make the guy in the truck blow his horn.
[209:09.27]Sandglass too, watch.
[209:11.69]Oh, this is fun.
[209:19.37]Do it!
[209:20.82]Do it!
[209:21.34]Nice, we got him to do it, he actually pulled it!
[209:23.60]Alright, I need belladonna and... What the hell was it?
[209:29.54]Nettle and belladonna.
[209:31.00]And wine, right?
[209:34.45]Prepare wine, belladonna, and nettle.
[209:42.68]I need the... Why can't I just go... It's clearly... Clearly this is just a part of the apothecary.
[209:50.44]Why do I have to leave and go all the way around?
[209:51.86]Hello.
[210:01.63]Hello.
[210:05.44]Let's talk trade.
[210:06.40]I need nettle.
[210:10.96]Oh, there.
[210:11.28]Alright, we got belladonna.
[210:12.44]How much is belladonna?
[210:14.32]I need two, so I can only... He only has five, so we'll do four.
[210:19.90]And then I need nettle.
[210:21.40]There's one, so I need two nettle.
[210:27.69]And then I need wine.
[210:31.65]And I could also use some garlic sauce, too.
[210:38.62]Does he sell wine, or is the wine already there?
[210:40.24]Okay, check the basket.
[210:46.44]That's cheap as shit.
[210:47.48]I don't even care.
[210:51.58]I'm not gonna haggle the guy for four dollars.
[210:56.11]The wine's just at the bench.
[210:57.29]Okay.
[210:58.11]Easy enough.
[211:01.99]Can't climb.
[211:04.83]Alright, start alchemy.
[211:08.66]Alright, I'm gonna fuck this up, so.
[211:13.07]Prepare wine, two handfuls of belladonna, and one nettle.
[211:17.61]Boil the nettle for two turns.
[211:20.61]Grind the belladonna.
[211:23.09]Drop in the belladonna and boil for one more turn.
[211:26.93]So we boil the nettle for two turns, grind up belladonna, and then drop in belladonna and boil one more.
[211:35.31]Nettle two turns.
[211:43.18]Okay, there's wine.
[211:47.14]Take the wine.
[211:56.05]And then we put in the nettle.
[211:58.01]We boil the nettle for two turns.
[211:59.79]Alright, belladonna.
[212:17.40]We grind up the belladonna.
[212:27.47]Okay.
[212:34.23]Put that down.
[212:38.29]Put it down.
[212:40.61]Put it down.
[212:44.83]Hold on a second.
[212:45.39]Wait, I can't... Any fucking seasoned chef prepares his ingredients beforehand.
[212:56.36]I couldn't just chop that up and leave it?
[212:57.62]I have to... Oh my lord, really?
[213:01.52]So, nettle.
[213:10.41]No, that's fine.
[213:14.15]Two nettles.
[213:19.85]Boil that shit for two turns.
[213:23.77]Here we go.
[213:25.27]Okay, here it comes.
[213:25.95]Ready?
[213:26.53]Is it boiling?
[213:28.23]Okay, turn!
[213:40.18]Oh!
[213:40.82]Again!
[213:45.06]Turn number two.
[213:45.62]Alright, take it out.
[214:01.46]Dump it in.
[214:01.90]And then we boil again for one more turn.
[214:07.74]Alright, boil.
[214:18.62]There it goes.
[214:24.48]Wait, what?
[214:24.98]Hold on.
[214:29.81]Is the water not boiling yet?
[214:30.95]I don't understand.
[214:35.97]The water wasn't boiling.
[214:46.25]So you, wait, you actually have to sit here and just let it, and boil the water.
[214:49.91]And now the fucking water's boiling, it's still gonna work, it's gonna be fine!
[214:52.37]No, it's not.
[214:55.05]I, alright, that, I did not understand that that's what was happening.
[214:58.53]We can try it again.
[214:59.71]Boil for two turns.
[215:03.66]The, it, okay.
[215:05.58]Well, alright.
[215:07.98]Can I, I was gonna reset it.
[215:08.86]Alright, let's reset.
[215:11.34]And, like, how was I supposed to know that that was exactly what was gonna happen?
[215:17.12]Perfect immersion.
[215:17.88]Yeah, like burnt dinner.
[215:19.34]I could do with a bite for me.
[215:22.80]So it was two net... I don't have two.
[215:25.52]I need two belladonna and one nettle, right?
[215:34.33]Alright, so nettle.
[215:36.47]I gotta be quick about this.
[215:44.08]I can't take it out.
[215:44.88]Why?
[215:45.00]Why?
[215:47.11]I have to do wine first.
[215:53.87]So that needs to be boiling.
[215:56.59]It's two nettle, one belladonna.
[216:01.56]Okay, so boil... I need to grind two belladonna and boil one nettle for two turns.
[216:09.46]So I do have to prepare this.
[216:10.60]I'm starting to get hungry.
[216:23.05]So I'm just going to leave this here.
[216:23.99]Just grind it up.
[216:34.96]Port de Razzdig.
[216:37.10]Alright, and just put it in the dish.
[216:40.22]You don't grind the nettle.
[216:42.18]So let's boil the water now.
[216:43.98]Boil it, because the nettle just goes in here.
[216:45.80]Alright, here we go.
[216:49.02]Boil the water, and then two turns, and then we dump this in.
[216:54.78]I would consider that boiling.
[216:56.34]I'll have to get something to eat.
[216:57.60]I'm starting to get hungry.
[216:59.62]So Nettle goes in there for two turns while it's boiling and then this dumps in for one turn.
[217:06.25]Alright, I'm ready.
[217:07.55]Nettle.
[217:10.93]Nettle.
[217:15.91]Throw it in there.
[217:19.75]Sandglass.
[217:22.29]Bellows.
[217:29.43]Okay, one more turn.
[217:34.19]Bellows.
[217:34.53]Alright, dump it in.
[217:49.71]Last turn.
[217:50.11]Might have been a little too long.
[217:55.30]Okay, done.
[217:59.57]How do I take it out?
[218:01.25]How do I take it out?
[218:01.75]How do I take it out?
[218:02.29]How do I take it out of the cauldron?
[218:05.47]No, how do I take it out?
[218:06.45]How do I take it out?
[218:09.19]How do I reach my hand in there?
[218:11.33]Still!
[218:12.71]What?
[218:12.97]How do I take it out?
[218:16.91]Oil?
[218:17.41]Spirits?
[218:19.07]A file!
[218:20.21]God damn it, you actually have to fill the file.
[218:32.83]I did it.
[218:41.99]Hooray!
[218:42.49]Well that was fun.
[218:46.23]I'll be buying my potions from now on.
[218:50.88]Let's see, did it work?
[218:54.68]Where did it be listed under food?
[218:56.84]There it is.
[218:58.40]Wait, where is it?
[218:59.76]It worked.
[219:03.02]That was fun.
[219:12.68]You are a sweet genius.
[219:16.10]Oh, damn it.
[219:16.96]Why?
[219:17.08]Well, how am I trespassing?
[219:18.58]I'm the fucking source!
[219:19.54]I'm the guy's apprentice!
[219:21.80]How do I have no business here?
[219:23.24]I'm the fucking apprentice!
[219:33.38]Why am I not allowed in here?
[219:35.38]Why am I trespassing?
[219:36.90]I have an idea.
[219:40.76]I do.
[219:41.00]So, let's do this.
[219:58.19]I'm trespassing, I'm trespassing, I'm trespassing.
[220:00.20]I'm sorry, I don't mean to trespass.
[220:02.40]I don't mean to.
[220:03.14]Why am I being punched now?
[220:15.01]Why am I not allowed in here?
[220:16.91]It's the fucking apothecary!
[220:21.83]Opening and closing hours?
[220:22.85]Why is it fucking closed?
[220:24.50]It's daylight!
[220:26.26]The door is open!
[220:29.26]The door is wide open.
[220:33.02]Oh my fucking god.
[220:34.40]Just take like 20 bucks and fuck your apothecary.
[220:37.68]I'll take my business elsewhere.
[220:41.18]Oh, shut the fuck up.
[220:45.84]Give me a break.
[220:49.62]I want to just shoot an arrow in this guy's head.
[220:51.67]I'm ready.
[221:00.29]Let's go do the mission.
[221:05.04]Uh, it's up here.
[221:07.30]I'm gonna go all the way back to... Wait, actually, I think I still have shit on my character.
[221:12.50]I want to dump into the... I need to eat, too.
[221:16.41]Alright, let's go to armor.
[221:17.59]130... Move to the horse.
[221:24.09]Weapons.
[221:24.81]I need to move this shit to the horse, this to the horse.
[221:32.42]I mean, I just have so many of these.
[221:33.90]Equip these.
[221:39.14]Piercing... I'll hold on to them.
[221:41.00]Just have them.
[221:43.65]Okay.
[221:44.51]I'm ready.
[221:46.81]My nourishment's at 44.
[221:49.01]I'm gonna just go... I'm gonna go eat somebody's random food.
[221:51.75]Actually, I'll just eat these.
[221:53.57]I have them.
[221:53.93]Might as well use them.
[221:59.51]Alright, let's do it.
[222:02.29]Moving up.
[222:05.20]We just have to go all the way up here again.
[222:08.94]To, uh... Where was that dude?
[222:13.10]The guy that I have to talk to to... Talk to Sir Davush.
[222:25.99]Uh...
[222:30.57]I mean, you already talked to Sir Davos.
[222:32.07]Where was he?
[222:32.49]Where the hell is Davos?
[222:40.16]What town is he in?
[222:43.98]Why is it not on the map?
[222:44.78]Davos.
[222:53.62]Davos.
[222:56.54]Not right here.
[223:06.14]Alright, let's do it!
[223:09.24]To Menchistry, but no man, this game is just massive!
[223:12.02]How am I supposed to remember every location that's not marked on the map?
[223:19.94]There's like 12 towns to remember.
[223:29.65]I'm gonna sleep and then do it in the morning.
[223:32.27]Or should I do it at night?
[223:41.65]I need you to answer if you see the chat is delayed.
[223:43.45]The chat is always delayed.
[223:47.23]From when I say something to when you see it, it's about 10 seconds.
[223:53.60]Like, for instance, if I'm going to snap my fingers and you're going to say snap.
[224:05.60]10 seconds.
[224:06.82]Almost exactly 10 seconds, actually.
[224:10.69]Alrighty.
[224:11.49]Where is he?
[224:12.99]Where's Mr. Talberg?
[224:14.66]Where's Mr. Berg?
[224:17.08]He's in here.
[224:17.56]I have to pee again so bad.
[224:20.22]Alright, let's just go to talk to Talberg.
[224:27.27]Let's just go to the bed.
[224:29.47]I'm gonna sleep first, too.
[224:32.39]Am I going out of the castle or in the castle?
[224:34.49]I'm going in.
[224:40.10]Let's sleep.
[224:41.54]And then we'll talk to Talberg.
[224:48.16]Eat some prepared food.
[224:49.76]Hopefully there's food on here somewhere.
[224:51.44]Let's do that now.
[224:54.64]Anybody got food?
[224:56.46]You got food in here?
[225:00.28]No, you don't.
[225:01.44]Useless.
[225:06.01]Absolutely useless.
[225:10.26]Food?
[225:11.74]Somebody's got something in here.
[225:13.96]Mm, smells good in here.
[225:35.67]And we're good.
[225:39.86]Time for bed.
[225:44.33]What are you looking at, horse?
[225:48.75]I eat my own hair.
[225:53.21]Okay, good night.
[225:55.12]See you in the morning.
[226:01.08]For our big raid.
[226:09.92]So after this, this is probably going to be the end of the stream today.
[226:14.98]And probably the end of Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[226:19.52]Sneeze.
[226:23.39]I tried to stop it from happening and there was no stopping it.
[226:33.35]We're going to do some more stuff this week.
[226:35.45]Game is saved.
[226:36.08]Good, good, good.
[226:38.94]Sneeze again.
[226:48.12]That hurt.
[226:51.32]Oh, yeah, no, no, we're definitely doing the battle.
[226:53.36]We're not gonna not do the battle, we're doing it absolute.
[226:58.51]I'm gonna sneeze again.
[227:00.15]Jesus.
[227:03.49]Give me a break, man.
[227:15.10]It's trying so hard to happen.
[227:20.82]Ah, it won't happen.
[227:25.04]Oh, this is the worst!
[227:32.66]I'm okay.
[227:38.05]Where is, where's Davos?
[227:42.73]Davos?
[227:44.97]My lord.
[227:52.89]Thanks.
[227:54.07]How are you?
[227:54.73]No, the devil is the guy with the goatee.
[227:56.21]No, not the goatee.
[227:57.73]Found him.
[227:58.15]Hand over the trophies.
[227:59.69]Show me.
[228:18.92]Oh.
[228:18.98]Training.
[228:19.16]Sword.
[228:19.32]Slightly advanced.
[228:19.96]Master.
[228:20.26]100 bucks.
[228:20.52]Let's do it.
[228:22.96]Let's learn a new technique.
[228:25.34]Ooh.
[228:25.44]Free.
[228:25.56]Free.
[228:48.36]What level is my sword?
[228:53.98]Warfare.
[228:55.82]Rusty Edge.
[228:58.02]This one sucks.
[228:59.28]The less your stamina, the greater damage you cause.
[229:02.34]Satis.
[229:02.72]When you draw an opponent's blood, it gives you a plus one strength bonus.
[229:07.25]Um... I'd probably say Furious.
[229:16.75]Yeah.
[229:18.78]I mean, this one maybe.
[229:19.64]Either sadist or furious.
[229:22.97]Sadist probably would happen more often.
[229:27.77]Yeah.
[229:29.19]Skills, combat.
[229:32.07]Sword.
[229:32.43]Apparently, level 10 I can do more.
[229:36.89]I gotta remember some of this shit, man.
[229:38.37]This is short sword, long sword.
[229:39.69]That's bang, bang, bang.
[229:42.82]Top right, bottom left.
[229:46.82]bang bang bang okay why was he on the ground alright um where is this guy you just buy the beginner training okay that's cool is he not in this castle right now is he somewhere else
[230:16.04]Or is he just walking around?
[230:24.36]Snap!
[230:35.51]He's in this castle, but asleep.
[230:37.11]It's late.
[230:37.73]Where's this guy at?
[230:42.22]He told me to come back.
[230:44.56]She sleeps in here.
[230:48.36]This is his quarters, right?
[230:53.54]Or at least it was.
[230:54.32]Oh, come on, man.
[231:03.48]Do I just have to stand around?
[231:09.22]Um...
[231:17.13]The last time this happened, he kind of just walked up the stairs eventually.
[231:23.78]Where does this path take him?
[231:24.82]Maybe he's at the other camp?
[231:29.72]Um... Hmm.
[231:39.43]Let's take one peek out here.
[231:46.43]Maybe he's just walking around out here.
[231:56.00]Maybe I'll try the other camp.
[232:02.40]Back here.
[232:06.68]He's with Radzig.
[232:12.21]I don't have a quest marker anymore.
[232:14.35]It's not showing up anymore.
[232:19.04]Try it.
[232:24.92]Look at the quest log.
[232:25.92]Let's see in a sec.
[232:37.13]Um... When you're ready for battle, talk to Sir Davish.
[232:42.95]Divish.
[232:46.43]It doesn't really say, like, where he's gonna be.
[233:01.38]I have a little bit of funny views behind me.
[233:02.70]This is for Davos.
[233:05.12]Yeah, I need to find Davos.
[233:15.47]Did you disable the main objective on your map?
[233:17.81]I don't think I did that.
[233:24.87]I don't even know how that's possible to do.
[233:29.86]Now see, like... See, now I got like these on the map.
[233:35.46]Maybe... I have A now.
[233:47.38]I have one single A. And it's this one.
[234:00.87]Maybe that?
[234:03.19]Where does that put me now?
[234:04.63]Does that put anything on the map?
[234:08.61]Did I scout the camp?
[234:09.57]Yeah, I did already.
[234:10.25]Um... Uh... Yeah, like, I didn't do the optional stuff, but I went back to...
[234:32.73]Whatever his name is.
[234:33.67]Ratshit.
[234:34.15]What's the guy's name?
[234:34.75]Because I should be here.
[234:38.39]I should be here.
[234:39.43]I'll just go back to Talenberg.
[234:53.48]Let me just take a...
[234:57.62]I'm just like going back and forth between these two towns.
[235:00.99]Go back to the old save.
[235:02.21]Go to the camp at Miro.
[235:04.73]Why just wouldn't there be a marker on my minimap right now?
[235:09.67]When I left Talonburg, he was like, come back and see me when you're ready.
[235:12.89]And he's just not here.
[235:15.25]Why would come back and see me mean come back and see me not here at a different place?
[235:19.56]He said to come back here.
[235:28.51]The last thing I was told was, come back to me when you're ready here.
[235:31.49]And he was just upstairs.
[235:39.92]If he's not up here, I'm just going to go to the camp and see if he's just standing there.
[235:42.46]No, that's not him.
[235:48.00]He was sleeping?
[235:48.80]No, this is not the right... It's up top.
[235:54.39]Alright, are you here?
[236:00.04]This is Stephanie's room.
[236:06.66]Is he in his special quarters?
[236:08.46]Come on.
[236:09.22]Be here.
[236:09.50]Now you're here.
[236:10.82]Jesus Christ.
[236:11.22]I'm ready.
[236:11.53]May God be with you in battle.
[236:26.27]Let's do the big battle with our 5,000 people.
[236:29.44]He was asleep when I showed up at 5 a.m.
[236:31.82]I was running around at like 10 o'clock in the morning.
[236:33.86]He wasn't in any of the beds.
[236:37.62]I'm glad to see you, Captain Robart.
[236:39.90]I hope Henry's explained everything to you.
[236:41.73]Yeah, he did.
[236:43.53]But I find it hard to believe.
[236:45.68]Who could possibly put together such a significant military force?
[236:49.70]A significant military force.
[236:51.77]We'll just have to find out.
[236:52.93]But I don't think we will until after a battle.
[236:55.47]If we don't deal with them now, who knows what they'll be capable of in a week or two.
[236:59.41]I agree entirely, my lord.
[237:01.19]What's the plan?
[237:02.23]Sprinted.
[237:03.31]Swinging wildly.
[237:05.32]Now we'll have to advance cautiously.
[237:07.94]Look at how many men I have.
[237:09.66]So I can decide which side to lead the attack from.
[237:12.46]Sir, that's a big responsibility.
[237:14.34]I don't think I should...
[237:15.50]I asked you a question, boy.
[237:17.36]You've been there and seen everything, so speak up.
[237:19.78]There are three ways to get in.
[237:21.73]Directly along the straight path to the camp, the long way round through the woods and over an old weir, or by a narrow bridge over a deep ditch.
[237:29.81]Let's start with the direct route.
[237:31.39]That sounds like the easiest approach.
[237:32.69]Direct.
[237:32.97]Let's go right in the front door.
[237:33.85]How does it look there?
[237:35.25]That path leads round their battlements.
[237:37.19]It's fortified and patrolled.
[237:39.21]The chances are they'd shower us with arrows on the way.
[237:41.91]It's a good thing you're here.
[237:42.79]You never learned the master strokes?
[237:44.18]Yeah, I do.
[237:45.18]I have the master strokes.
[237:46.86]I know them.
[237:48.12]I don't like the idea of marching such a long way over rough ground, but...
[237:51.74]I went back and did all did the master technique where you parry I thought so what about the last approach over the bridge it's a bit narrow for my liking it's narrow alright but once we get over we can quickly occupy the best ground for a battle we only have to take down a few arches
[238:14.50]The battleground sounds inviting, but that bridge and the archers, it's not an easy decision.
[238:20.54]Each option has its pros and cons.
[238:23.75]But which will we do?
[238:25.85]And you'll be suitably rewarded for your efforts.
[238:28.73]From what you say, the route over the bridge is the best option.
[238:31.73]If we're fast, we'll have the advantage.
[238:34.09]With the help of God, we'll win this day.
[238:38.10]Alright, are you ready for the climax of the Kingdom Come streams?
[238:42.57]Because this is it.
[238:43.31]This is it?
[238:43.83]This is the entire army?
[238:45.91]Of all of Bohemia?
[238:48.29]It's ten guys.
[238:51.93]That's massive.
[239:10.39]Charge!
[239:11.23]So long as you take the left flank, we'll attack you two places at once!
[239:15.95]Point out for the archers!
[239:18.01]Shields!
[239:19.78]A.K.A.
[239:20.40]Jeremy hides behind everybody and uses them as shields.
[239:25.80]There's so many of them!
[239:29.42]Oh, a large-scale battle like I've wanted!
[239:36.12]I'm a sadist!
[239:39.64]What?
[239:40.02]Why did he do that?
[239:47.62]Why would... I just got stabbed in the back.
[239:55.21]Men!
[239:56.95]Keep going!
[239:58.21]That guy's mask is on wrong.
[240:00.35]Alright, now what?
[240:09.35]This is... this is LARPing.
[240:12.79]This looks and feels like a LARPing event.
[240:16.17]Here we go, time to LARP!
[240:24.38]Good work, men!
[240:29.20]You don't even lock on.
[240:48.78]We're just decimating them.
[240:49.82]They can't even function.
[240:51.38]I can't wait to run by and just seagull the hell out of all this.
[240:55.60]I should be doing that now.
[240:56.98]Fuck this mission.
[240:58.76]Money is all I care about.
[240:59.84]Where's your money?
[241:02.45]Didn't have any money.
[241:03.35]Fuck.
[241:06.73]Oh, I thought the whole army was gone.
[241:08.17]Alright, where's the bad guy?
[241:21.60]Still going.
[241:22.74]Move to the cart.
[241:27.24]Who takes money to a battlefield?
[241:28.84]I don't know.
[241:30.36]Maybe they forgot they had it.
[241:38.17]This is where you go to the renaissance fair and you see the reenactors.
[241:43.49]Okay, I gotta take care of those guys with the bows.
[241:47.92]That's my job.
[241:58.70]I'm doing a good job.
[242:00.92]Taking care of the battlements.
[242:02.52]Get the fuck out of the way.
[242:04.44]Oh my god, get out of the fucking way, you stupid body.
[242:12.26]Just back him up.
[242:19.99]Yeah, they're just shitty archers.
[242:21.63]They're not even good at fighting.
[242:30.02]Yeah, all they do is use bows.
[242:31.44]They're not even good fighters like me.
[242:39.60]I'm gonna lose.
[242:40.80]Because I'm being an asshole.
[242:43.22]I'm stuck.
[242:44.24]I'm stuck on somebody.
[242:46.42]I'm stuck.
[242:55.01]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[243:05.70]I couldn't fucking move.
[243:07.58]I literally had to go do the joke where I, like, I had to go do the stupid joke.
[243:12.58]This whole game's playing itself right now, and I had to do the thing where I'd run up the wrong direction and just swing wildly.
[243:21.51]Nothing matters.
[243:22.55]Who cares?
[243:23.07]This is what you're supposed to do.
[243:46.23]Now they're running.
[243:46.79]This is like... How are we not hitting each other?
[243:52.75]You have to kill the archers?
[243:56.94]Well, the archers are zoning out when we get far enough away.
[244:07.68]That guy has a mustache on his helmet.
[244:15.24]I kind of want to see if I can hit my own people.
[244:16.72]Yeah, I can.
[244:17.32]I hit him right in the back of the head.
[244:18.86]I just won.
[244:27.76]Oh, deal with those archers.
[244:31.79]Deal with those archers.
[244:36.29]They've been dealt with.
[244:42.35]They took care of themselves.
[244:43.95]We're fine.
[244:48.24]Alright, we're good.
[244:50.08]Anybody want any soup?
[244:55.17]I gotta get the mustache helmet.
[244:56.31]Holy shit, you're right.
[244:57.03]Where is it?
[244:57.83]Where's the guy with the mustache?
[244:59.65]He was the commander.
[245:00.23]He was right here?
[245:00.61]There it is.
[245:05.25]Got it.
[245:08.40]This is too heavy for me.
[245:09.74]That's alright, I'm gonna take it.
[245:20.29]Bandages.
[245:21.35]How am I doing on health?
[245:22.77]I'm fine.
[245:28.49]Anything else?
[245:29.11]Apples.
[245:29.49]I mean, these are good.
[245:31.52]See?
[245:33.56]I told you, people.
[245:34.14]Somebody bought five dollars.
[245:41.74]Deal with the archers.
[245:42.46]Objective failed.
[245:44.44]Wait.
[245:47.90]They ran out here.
[245:48.74]They ran that way.
[245:50.46]Was I supposed to chase them?
[245:55.99]I didn't deal with the archers.
[246:01.33]Here's more.
[246:10.10]Reached a new level in strength.
[246:25.07]Hands up!
[246:26.45]Stop walking onto the same guy!
[246:48.77]Well, that guy had a cool move.
[246:56.64]Alright, almost, almost.
[247:02.87]What happened?
[247:03.59]Oh, the archers that I didn't deal with.
[247:12.72]Where am I?
[247:13.34]How you doing?
[247:16.08]How are you?
[247:19.16]What are you gonna do next?
[247:26.28]Got hit by a... I got hit by an archer.
[247:30.52]Open the door.
[247:31.00]Oh, wait, hold on.
[247:35.57]No, the archers up top didn't deal with the archers.
[247:37.97]And now they're causing a huge problem.
[247:54.57]Love the rings.
[248:01.19]Wait, wait a second.
[248:10.84]Hold on, do people have to stay alive?
[248:12.56]They didn't tell me that.
[248:19.17]No, I don't want it.
[248:22.77]These guys are dressed the same.
[248:36.24]This is fucking so stupid.
[248:38.99]I love it.
[248:48.61]Oh my god.
[248:49.43]We gotta go kill the archers.
[248:57.88]I'm gonna take care of the archers this time.
[248:59.52]Where are they even going?
[249:02.60]They're all running into the hole.
[249:05.29]I gotta get the mustache again.
[249:07.29]It's important.
[249:19.59]Okay.
[249:20.33]Got the commander.
[249:21.15]There he is.
[249:22.15]Give me the helmet.
[249:23.17]No, that's not the right helmet, is it?
[249:28.76]What the fuck is that?
[249:29.78]No.
[249:30.10]I need the mustache.
[249:32.77]No, where's the... God damn it.
[249:36.03]No, I gotta... I gotta just beat the mission.
[249:37.69]Build the archers.
[249:49.69]They just ran out here.
[249:52.93]Like the...
[250:03.65]This is stupid.
[250:04.73]Why is nobody out here with me?
[250:06.51]Why do I have to do this by myself?
[250:14.19]Why is this archer like a... Why is he a master swordsman?
[250:24.20]Fuck you!
[250:26.34]Deal with those archers!
[250:29.32]Where are they?
[250:30.26]I don't see any more archers.
[250:36.17]Dealt with.
[250:56.66]Take down those archers, quickly!
[251:06.96]Yeah, really?
[251:08.76]Yeah, this is great.
[251:11.64]This is great.
[251:13.28]Great.
[251:14.62]Great.
[251:17.01]This is just great.
[251:21.23]Walk up the stairs, please.
[251:36.92]We can't even fight up here.
[251:45.20]This is a bad place to be fighting.
[251:47.92]Of course.
[251:56.64]Who else is shooting?
[251:57.56]Is there another archer up here?
[252:04.39]I did it.
[252:04.87]Hooray.
[252:08.59]Ring.
[252:10.83]I don't even... I don't want to take that much stuff.
[252:12.21]I just need to win.
[252:18.65]Fight through the charge.
[252:19.47]This time, don't... Don't attack and kill somebody that's on my own team.
[252:29.58]I can't save here?
[252:31.02]Can't save in combat.
[252:32.52]That sucks.
[252:34.54]Alright, here we go.
[252:49.18]Don't get in my way!
[252:50.22]Oh shit.
[253:05.39]Why do you have infinite health?
[253:10.94]Do it again.
[253:14.64]This guy's gonna fireman's axe.
[253:39.17]Reached a new level of agility, at least.
[253:51.42]Okay.
[253:53.06]I'm just... What am I getting?
[253:53.94]I'm getting hit by archers.
[254:01.21]I need to, like, heal.
[254:03.01]Who the fuck is that guy?
[254:06.11]I'm gonna heal.
[254:10.11]I can't.
[254:13.47]When does this stop?
[254:23.47]Stab him!
[254:25.37]He can't block from all directions.
[254:37.31]Can someone please kill this guy?
[254:42.65]Okay.
[254:43.63]Not in combat, right?
[254:44.62]No, are we?
[254:50.98]What the fuck is going on?
[254:53.20]I need to heal.
[254:57.06]Like, I have to shoot these guys.
[255:22.03]What they're coming from up there I need to heal I need to bandage and heal This is just game over man Where are my bandages I can't bandage in combat
[255:42.90]How am I supposed to do this?
[255:45.26]How do I get out of combat?
[255:52.74]I'm gonna die again here.
[255:54.70]Like... Just don't take damage.
[255:58.90]That took... I've lost the battle.
[256:12.40]Okay.
[256:27.89]Alright, so if I avoid getting hit and everybody dies, I lose.
[256:30.79]If I get hit too many times, I die.
[256:32.85]And just lose anyways.
[256:34.45]So the archers have to die.
[256:36.06]Like, I have to just kill them now.
[256:37.38]I mean... Just don't take any damage.
[256:42.10]Okay.
[256:54.02]You have to be good.
[256:55.56]Explain to me how you're good in this.
[256:58.98]This is like chivalry with 30 people playing at the same time.
[257:02.97]There's no rhyme or reason to anything that's happening right now.
[257:07.17]Remember when you played chivalry?
[257:09.45]And you did like those fucking free-for-all arenas?
[257:12.30]And it was just a total fucking mess?
[257:19.20]There's no rhyme or reason to anything right now.
[257:39.08]Alright, now watch, take care of those archers.
[257:46.70]Well, there's one guy left.
[257:52.38]There's so many of those archers.
[257:54.58]How come he's not yelling at me to take care of the archers yet?
[257:56.47]Oh good, this is perfect, because now they're gonna come out here.
[257:58.71]Oh shit!
[257:59.41]God damn it!
[258:01.75]Alright, deal with the archers.
[258:03.51]Don't let them pass!
[258:04.41]Just don't let them pass!
[258:05.25]Why do I have to be the gatekeeper?! !
[258:12.87]Why do I have to fight them all out here?
[258:15.81]This seems completely unfair.
[258:17.25]I don't even know where they're running.
[258:26.92]One of them actually ran in here.
[258:30.04]I'm gonna get hit by an arrow because I have to run up here.
[258:46.04]I don't want to just take unnecessary damage having to run up there.
[258:50.32]Okay, he's coming down.
[258:51.76]I hit him.
[258:55.03]Keep going all the way down.
[258:59.71]It's alright.
[259:00.59]He's a moron.
[259:01.51]He'll end up down here in a sec.
[259:02.41]I need one more.
[259:14.63]Oh my god.
[259:20.76]Now I got stuck on the other side.
[259:22.90]I got... Calm.
[259:25.48]Be calm.
[259:40.01]He's not even shooting at me.
[259:42.38]This guy doesn't even care that I exist.
[259:44.44]He's gonna hit me.
[259:49.08]Alright.
[259:49.72]Kill the archers now.
[259:51.24]That's the only thing I'm focusing on.
[259:52.46]Only the archers.
[260:02.19]Can I save it right here?
[260:03.61]No.
[260:09.10]Alright.
[260:09.62]Forget about all the brainless idiots over here.
[260:11.88]Here are the archers.
[260:14.30]Just pick them off.
[260:19.08]Guy, how did you get behind us?
[260:30.22]Give me a fucking break.
[260:32.47]Give me a break.
[260:35.53]Seriously, just stop.
[260:36.63]Just get down here.
[260:37.51]Oh my god.
[260:43.95]Jump down and punch me.
[260:49.69]He's not coming down.
[260:50.51]Yeah, there he is.
[260:54.87]Come on down.
[260:59.51]Why?
[261:08.14]Okay, please.
[261:08.84]Is he dead?
[261:10.20]He's dead, right?
[261:10.78]He's dead.
[261:11.20]Okay, no more archers to deal with.
[261:13.64]Just random shitties.
[261:39.93]Why are you running away, man?
[261:41.73]We need people to fight.
[261:48.78]Last one.
[261:58.99]Fight through the church.
[261:59.99]This guy's still alive.
[262:03.33]Kill him.
[262:03.69]Alright, here they are.
[262:08.33]Another batch.
[262:22.23]Don't die don't die Again Come on swing
[262:48.22]Dead.
[262:49.68]Just get behind them and swing wildly.
[262:51.00]Doesn't even matter.
[262:51.62]That didn't even work.
[263:07.89]Run away!
[263:08.29]Goodbye!
[263:08.79]Thank you!
[263:09.11]Okay, time to fight.
[263:10.89]Let's go.
[263:12.79]What happened?
[263:13.91]Are we gonna get through?
[263:18.05]Alright, we got through.
[263:22.97]This is what we've been waiting for.
[263:27.65]Into the breach.
[263:32.92]Tactical retreat.
[263:33.64]They outnumbered us, by the way.
[263:35.04]Stand your ground, you dogs!
[263:43.93]Drive them back!
[263:48.64]Do I get a chance to heal?
[263:55.51]Is the game safe here?
[263:56.25]I tried before and yet here I am.
[264:10.68]But who the hell are you?
[264:13.20]What are we reading here?
[264:17.13]You don't remember me?
[264:18.09]I remember you!
[264:19.33]Are we in darkness?
[264:22.95]Where's my fucking sword?
[264:26.59]What the fuck you on about?
[264:27.57]What so- hang on!
[264:28.47]You're the- fuck me!
[264:29.55]I thought we left you to the crows!
[264:37.66]Tough little fucker, eh?
[264:43.29]What did you do with my sword?
[264:45.31]Judging by our last encounter, I'd say you made a big mistake coming here.
[264:50.63]Where's my fucking sword?
[264:52.31]But then again, maybe you've had some practice.
[264:53.85]Hope so, because last time was too easy.
[265:02.38]And the fight begins.
[265:04.66]Kill the bandit commander in the steeple.
[265:07.38]Hold on.
[265:07.94]What?
[265:12.49]Just stay right there for a minute!
[265:15.79]I can't heal?
[265:16.35]I can't save?
[265:16.99]I can't save the game here?
[265:25.11]Hey, wait a second!
[265:27.49]That's the easiest thing I've ever done!
[266:04.56]You guys told me this was gonna be really hard.
[266:19.77]Everyone told me this was gonna be like impossible.
[266:24.09]It's not over yet, you scum.
[266:26.17]Now where's my sword?
[266:27.13]You over-leveled him.
[266:28.33]What?
[266:28.47]Talk, you bastard!
[266:31.91]I'll see you in hell.
[266:43.19]Tell me, do you hear me?
[266:45.19]Tell me what you've done with it!
[266:51.80]I'll try spinning.
[266:52.50]That's a cool trick.
[266:57.83]So I killed the hardest boss so far in two hits.
[267:01.43]But one of his cronies outside took like 15 to 20 hits.
[267:04.15]Huh?
[267:04.51]What did he tell you?
[267:21.41]He had no helmet.
[267:22.41]I guess.
[267:22.61]I guess I hit him in the face three times in a row.
[267:24.42]Do I get to claim this castle as my own?
[267:52.04]I guess a sword in the face is pretty deadly, you're right.
[267:57.42]He pushes a little too hard and he goes down.
[268:23.27]Now, put it all behind you.
[268:26.59]A decent Christian shouldn't dwell on such horrors.
[268:31.63]I beg to differ, sir.
[268:34.93]I never want to forget this.
[268:38.35]He's going to be gone.
[268:38.91]The time has come for those whore sons to pay for what they did to us.
[268:43.27]You're right, my boy.
[268:44.89]But first, we all need some rest.
[268:47.39]I don't like that haircut.
[268:49.03]We'll meet later in the upper castle in Ratte and then decide what to do next.
[268:53.31]Do I get some money for this?
[269:22.38]And?
[269:23.28]Okay.
[269:23.64]It's like, huh?
[269:24.42]Is that the end of the game?
[269:27.94]I was going to say put on like rock music.
[269:30.00]I didn't have it ready.
[269:30.94]I was going to put on like a typical ending credits theme for a TV show.
[269:42.18]Our next part of our plan.
[269:45.51]We're gonna conquer all of Bohemia now that these rascals are out.
[269:52.35]Oh, thank you.
[269:54.33]I almost just swung at that guy.
[269:55.19]Questions and answers now.
[269:55.81]We got more to do.
[270:19.37]I've got a lot of tasks now, it seems.
[270:22.05]But, unfortunately, that's where I'm going to end the stream today.
[270:28.33]That's going to be it.
[270:28.89]The first major boss major thing.
[270:33.22]There's like three times more store to do.
[270:36.88]The game is very large and there's a lot to do in the game.
[270:40.60]But let's just riot.
[270:42.18]What do you mean riot?
[270:44.39]So because this is the last you're going to see of this, we're going to go on a town rampage.
[270:52.79]So the game has been saved.
[270:55.62]I'm going to go on a rampage now.
[270:58.16]We're going to hold ourselves inside of a house and just swing until we kill everybody that comes in the door.
[271:07.63]Everyone loves me here.
[271:09.21]What a disaster this will be.
[271:11.03]I'm going to try to take as much stuff as I can.
[271:14.35]I'm going to steal the best weapon in the game and then kill the guy with it.
[271:17.37]And then we'll just go on rampage.
[271:18.57]Let's see, what do we got?
[271:20.41]Knight's hunting sword.
[271:22.57]Decorated hunting sword.
[271:23.71]Decorated noble's sword.
[271:25.03]Noble's hunting sword.
[271:25.89]Or any of these... Master Huntsman's sword.
[271:34.32]What's the best weapon in the whole game?
[271:36.70]That's on the table here.
[271:40.98]Let's just ask him.
[271:44.19]Alright, what do you got?
[271:51.15]Um... Herod's sword.
[271:58.98]It's 1.5k.
[272:00.04]And 75 damage.
[272:01.80]Where is that on the table?
[272:03.48]Herod's sword.
[272:06.74]I don't see it on the table.
[272:08.14]Is it over here?
[272:08.64]There it is.
[272:10.85]Herod's sword.
[272:11.53]There's like the best sword this guy has.
[272:15.77]Mace.
[272:16.03]Let's do Mace.
[272:22.05]Save the game?
[272:23.57]Uh, the game already saved, I think, right?
[272:27.86]When I finished that last cutscene and came in here.
[272:32.38]Let's see.
[272:34.58]Do the runt.
[272:40.39]Uh, let me make... The game did save, right?
[272:52.44]I have no skill with maces.
[272:53.44]I won't even be able to pick the thing up.
[272:58.36]I didn't really pay attention if the game saved or not.
[273:00.66]I don't want to save with a potion.
[273:01.68]That would be a waste.
[273:02.58]Where's my bedroom?
[273:08.18]I was just there.
[273:08.78]It's back here.
[273:19.71]Bed.
[273:21.72]Nope.
[273:22.76]Other way.
[273:25.36]Use the god mode.
[273:26.12]No, we're gonna go until I lose.
[273:29.96]And then that's gonna be for today.
[273:31.81]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[273:47.38]Sit.
[273:48.02]Sleep.
[273:49.76]What about the sword?
[273:50.28]Oh, I'm gonna get it.
[273:50.80]Don't worry.
[273:52.61]I'm gonna steal it and then kill a guy with it.
[274:01.08]Streaming six days in a row?
[274:02.46]Yeah.
[274:03.26]Well, I wanted to make up for the fact that I'd missed an entire week of streams.
[274:07.52]Because I was all over the place, um... Helping out my mother and everything, so... I did want to go long for a good week straight.
[274:18.46]We'll be back to normal after this week.
[274:20.80]Maybe we're gonna go Thursday and Friday.
[274:25.34]But anyways, let's do it.
[274:27.26]Thank you for watching.
[274:28.16]Let's see how long I can last.
[274:29.12]Let's see if I can get to six stars.
[274:31.28]I wonder if I can do it.
[274:33.47]We'll know when the army shows up.
[274:45.29]Learn how to ride a horse.
[274:49.30]Alright, here it is.
[274:49.82]Herod's sword.
[274:50.60]Yes, you do.
[275:00.72]Okay, now... Surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender.
[275:04.60]Yeah, just pay it.
[275:05.78]Oh, what now?

[277:02.93]Hold on.
[277:13.35]Oh no, oh god, no!
[277:24.10]What's this guy doing?
[277:26.18]I couldn't even fucking do anything.
[277:30.63]I was just locked in there and I couldn't block.
[277:38.24]I got the two stars.
[277:41.90]Only two stars, really?
[278:03.85]Why would that not kill you?
[278:08.32]Am I shooting you with, like, nerf arrows?
[278:16.88]Can I not do this?
[278:26.45]What the?
[278:26.95]Oh, come on.
[278:28.97]She just winked at him.
[278:35.52]She like winked at him and said like, I'm gonna go right now.
[278:48.68]I was hoping, I wanted her to get hit by the arrow.
[278:55.49]By the way, speaking of arrows, I can't even hurt anybody with my arrows.
[278:58.89]Time to just like sneak up and choke somebody up.
[279:10.25]Let's go and, like, murder, like, somebody's entire, like... Let's go murder somebody's entire existence.
[279:18.06]I'm gonna wait till this person shows up and kill them in their own house.
[279:25.98]I wanna wait till somebody's asleep.
[279:27.68]And just... Just stab them.
[279:47.68]Nothing here.
[279:48.14]You have cabbage in your house.
[279:51.33]Wow, your place sucks.
[280:10.12]Where is it?

[280:30.04]Fucking lockpicking.
[280:36.70]Somebody help!
[280:41.53]Yeah.
[280:42.59]I mean, I hear you, but... She's just kind of being annoying right now.
[280:55.81]Ahhhh!
[281:20.03]That was all the piercing arrows I had Why can I not I really I can't choke a guy out ten levels into the game I fell down the hill
[281:49.11]That's one of the NPCs.
[281:51.33]That's like one of the quest NPCs.
[281:52.95]Alright, I'm done.
[281:57.16]Lost to a peasant.
[282:20.43]I can't believe a fucking random peasant just stopped me from choking him out.
[282:24.40]Okay, here we go.
[282:34.23]Lady in the kitchen.
[282:36.05]Close the door, so nobody sees it.
[282:58.58]Pick up body, drop body.
[282:59.96]I don't understand.
[283:01.64]What?
[283:02.92]You there!
[283:03.85]Stop!
[283:05.07]Surrender!
[283:06.23]You've committed a violation.
[283:08.25]You're under arrest.
[283:16.27]I'm warning you.
[283:17.40]Keep yourself up.
[283:23.88]Why can I not kill this lady?
[283:25.04]I won't repeat it again.
[283:31.69]Why wouldn't you stop me?
[283:34.73]Let's see if I can take a guard on One-on-one a guard
[284:10.48]Okay.
[284:13.55]That was- okay, he's done.
[284:18.57]Alright, how many people can I get in here?
[284:23.82]How many people can I get in here and kill?
[284:26.98]Hey!
[284:29.74]Come in here.
[284:33.28]Hey!
[284:39.63]Hey!
[284:41.47]You!
[284:41.99]Don't move a muscle!
[284:43.59]Surrender!
[284:44.51]You'll have to answer for your lawbreak.
[284:47.93]Oh, I will?
[284:48.45]I will, huh?
[284:49.47]Okay.
[284:52.25]I'll have to answer to my lawbreaking.
[284:59.58]I'm making my... Mm-hmm.
[285:13.45]I'm standing right here.
[285:15.01]What do you mean you can't hide from me?
[285:17.57]Don't move a finger.
[285:39.67]Why can they not see me in here?
[285:42.35]Um... Oh no, I got a bad feeling about this.
[286:09.51]I'm gonna go out the window, aren't I?
[286:14.49]Eventually I'm going out this window.
[286:15.69]They're just taking turns pushing me.
[286:20.69]This is just bullying.
[286:21.87]We're gonna try to break this game.
[286:32.84]Guy pulled out a bow and arrow.
[286:35.50]Bad move.
[286:36.18]He's gonna hit his own buddy.
[286:41.54]There's more guards coming in.
[286:46.94]What's the matter?
[286:47.74]He's getting hurt.
[286:59.02]How many people can we fit in here?
[287:01.04]Yeah, he's got hit in the stomach by his own buddy.
[287:07.09]I'll have you.
[287:08.01]I'll have you.
[287:10.50]Eventually, somebody's going to accidentally kill somebody here.
[287:20.18]Oh, god damn it.
[287:23.08]I'm in trouble now.
[287:23.88]It's over.
[287:25.98]That's it.
[287:26.38]Ah!
[287:38.36]That guy's shooting me point blank.
[287:41.70]This is not fair.
[287:42.64]Look at this guy on the right.
[287:44.13]He's just aiming his bow and arrow at me point blank.
[287:46.31]Bring it on.
[287:47.13]He must be here.
[288:10.31]Oh, that's funny.
[288:14.66]I'm just fucking around now.
[288:22.10]I want better arrows.
[288:23.48]I wish I had a mark.
[288:24.48]You know what?
[288:26.16]2020 hindsight, I wish I did archery.
[288:28.81]Because that would have been funny.
[288:31.23]Funny.
[288:31.59]There's got to be a place where I can hole up and just break the whole game, right?
[288:39.08]Like in here or something.
[288:41.84]Just cause the whole game to fuck up.
[288:44.56]Yeah, I'm gonna use this as my... Yeah, I think I can fuck the whole game up if I do this.
[288:51.82]I was in there.
[288:52.30]I had it.
[288:52.86]Because they're not gonna be able to get in here.
[288:59.80]Try this again.
[289:05.01]I got right... I got behind too.
[289:06.29]That was a mistake to leave.
[289:18.17]Damn it.
[289:20.77]Install the Shrek mod.
[289:22.03]Let me close the door first.
[289:31.88]How did I get up there last time?
[289:36.32]Console commands?
[289:37.06]Let's just get in here like this.
[289:40.14]Just aim out the window.
[289:51.06]Do they even know I'm doing this?
[289:58.10]Come on, I don't have any other chances.
[289:59.46]One more chance.
[290:12.80]They don't know where it's coming from.
[290:14.60]He's looking in the sky.
[290:16.30]There they come.
[290:20.19]He must have fired from here.
[290:23.07]I've got you, you dog.
[290:24.23]You stop right where you are.
[290:27.13]Here we go.
[290:28.97]We did it.
[290:30.25]Where could he have vanished to?
[290:32.15]I'm warning you.
[290:33.15]Give yourself up.
[290:35.19]Just get them all in here.
[290:36.03]Get the whole town in here.
[290:36.77]You son of a bitch.
[290:39.71]Surrender.
[290:41.05]You'll have to answer for your law breaking.
[290:43.13]I'm telling you.
[290:44.03]Surrender.
[290:48.29]a second.
[290:49.95]What?
[290:53.11]Why did I instantly die?
[290:54.95]I did one little spin and it hit me in the chin and I fucking died.
[291:04.76]Wait, I don't believe that for a second.
[291:07.66]That was bullshit.
[291:13.57]Perfect.
[291:14.09]Got it.
[291:14.69]Yes.
[291:15.15]Thank God.
[291:15.67]I actually got it.
[291:18.05]This is where the fun begins.
[291:21.35]I just have to annoy somebody.
[291:32.24]Somebody has to hear this and investigate it.
[291:40.10]Because they can't get over here.
[291:45.34]I have to scare somebody.
[291:46.28]Somebody has to come down the stairs.
[291:55.24]I don't want to risk losing my spot here.
[292:01.80]I have to wait till somebody comes downstairs.
[292:11.22]Come on.
[292:14.10]Am I out of arrows?
[292:15.84]No.
[292:18.76]What's going on?
[292:19.36]I can't shoot them.
[292:20.46]Stand up, man.
[292:25.63]um what hunting arrow I only I don't have like any arrows left better hunting arrow there we go okay well that's weird I can't use the web I can't use it now come on man really it's a lady
[293:04.96]Alright, go tell on me.
[293:05.58]Here we go.
[293:07.44]Nice!
[293:07.80]Alright, I got it.
[293:10.04]Back in the correct spot.
[293:10.94]Here they come.
[293:11.42]Somebody... Somebody... What was that?
[293:12.60]Oh, they're looking for me.
[293:24.15]I can't use any weapons while I'm standing here, though.
[293:27.43]Oh, goddammit.
[293:28.11]Come on.
[293:28.61]No, look in here!
[293:29.29]Look in here!
[293:33.47]I'm in here!
[293:38.47]Good.
[293:38.89]I don't think anybody has enough reach to do this.
[293:43.71]What do we do here?
[293:44.71]Why is that guy bleeding?
[294:04.23]This guy's bleeding.
[294:05.09]His head is bleeding.
[294:06.39]That's it.
[294:07.71]You're dead.
[294:09.12]Oh, shit.
[294:09.78]They're getting their phone.
[294:12.04]Oh, my God.
[294:13.02]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[294:14.54]Bring it on.
[294:16.98]They figured it out that they couldn't come over here, so now they're blaming their errors, which I would say that's pretty smart.
[294:22.26]You'll get what for.
[294:23.33]Mm-hmm.
[294:24.95]They figured it out, and that's unbelievable.
[294:29.33]You call that combat?
[294:36.75]Is that the best you can do?
[294:38.35]It's a firing squad now.
[294:46.32]Come here, lily liver.
[294:51.02]You can't have gotten far.
[294:53.67]I slaughter you.
[294:59.65]Bring it on.
[295:01.61]This is fucking stupid.
[295:04.19]I'll find you, you cur.
[295:06.41]You can't hide from me.
[295:08.67]No, no, no.
[295:12.19]Why are we still using our arrows?
[295:14.57]It's not smart.
[295:16.22]This is not smart for us to be doing this this close quarters.
[295:19.82]I'll find you, you cur.
[295:22.02]You can't hide from me.
[295:24.72]Jesus Christ.
[295:31.84]Why are they using their arrows?
[295:34.69]I don't understand why they have taken... They're not... What if I just crouch?
[295:42.87]Alright, get me back on the... Back up.
[295:50.19]Get me back up here.
[295:57.48]Fuck, that hurt.
[296:01.74]What?!
[296:10.09]Why can he do that, but I can't do that to him?
[296:18.75]This is absolutely moronic.
[296:26.43]That's it.
[296:29.83]They don't care anymore.
[296:40.17]Okay.
[296:42.05]Battle 1.
[296:42.41]What do you have for a bow?
[296:45.25]Alright, now we heal up and we do it again.
[296:49.47]Except in a different spot.
[296:51.09]Until I die and then the stream's over.
[296:58.92]Let's do bandage.
[297:03.34]Alright, we're okay.
[297:07.82]Put the weapon away.
[297:11.16]I thought there was a guy on the roof right there.
[297:15.61]He's somewhere.
[297:16.19]I don't know where he is.
[297:21.99]He has to be here somewhere.
[297:22.93]The game's a little borked here.
[297:41.16]Any more?
[297:41.72]Can I just shoot arrows over there?
[297:43.77]They don't know where I am.
[297:46.57]That didn't hit him.
[297:48.61]Now he's taking out his bow.
[298:10.67]I just have to stop moving.
[298:11.53]No.
[298:11.69]Civilian!
[298:12.01]Damn it!
[298:12.23]Alright, that's it.
[298:44.18]you guys doing?
[298:49.60]Oh, bloody hell.
[299:00.12]Get.
[299:00.90]Get.
[299:02.00]Get away.
[299:02.48]That's good quality.
[299:04.53]Game of the year.
[299:06.03]Well, I am deliberately fucking with the game, so.
[299:08.61]Alright, that's it.
[299:13.15]That's Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[299:17.77]Hope you enjoyed it.
[299:19.71]We will not be playing Kingdom Come Deliverance tomorrow.
[299:22.14]We're going to go back to PlayStation 1.
[299:23.14]We've got a lot of stuff to do for it.
[299:26.82]So, thank you for joining me on this off-schedule livestream.
[299:31.18]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[299:32.36]Probably... I want to... I like going early.
[299:37.26]recently starting between like five and seven rather than seven plus so I would assume we're gonna start tomorrow around the four to five pm mark again kingdom come deliverance gets a stamp of approval uh with one caveat here they uh
[300:03.73]I would probably say wait until they patch all the crippling game-breaking bugs.
[300:11.89]Because there are quite a few of them.
[300:15.01]So I would say wait until this game is fully functional.
[300:20.86]Because some things are just unforgivable.
[300:27.38]There ain't gonna be a patch.
[300:33.87]This game's a half-done?
[300:34.73]No, I... It does enough to justify playing it.
[300:41.43]It's fun to pick a class, be like a little shit.
[300:45.79]Mods will probably make it better, that's true.
[300:49.03]But... Remember, it is $60.
[300:52.67]So that is something to take into consideration, too.
[300:57.37]If you're trying to figure out your game budget over the next month or two,
[301:03.08]Maybe this will go on sale over the summer.
[301:06.74]And maybe by that point, they maybe will have patched a lot of the major issues.
[301:11.06]But if you can deal with the big major problems that are in the game, there is a game here.
[301:15.36]There is a fun, interesting game here.
[301:22.04]But, see you guys tomorrow.
[301:23.04]Let's do the credits.
[301:24.04]Thank you everybody for subscribing.

[304:26.74]Bitwise tonight we had... Let's go back here.
[304:35.00]Hey, RufusPlays, thanks for the 30 cents.
[304:36.76]Thank you for the EU stream.
[304:38.71]You're very welcome.
[304:40.43]I try to do it sometimes when I'm awake and up and I don't have any errands or anything to do.
[304:44.29]I try to do them.
[304:46.95]Thank you Brainwashed for the two bucks.
[304:52.92]Thank you KillGannon6 for the one dollar.
[304:54.44]Hey Jeremy, I just watched your best of 2017 video and it was great.
[304:58.04]Thank you for being cool and funny and I love you son.
[305:02.34]Thank you KillGannon.
[305:03.16]Thank HolyMack for his fantastic work on the second channel.
[305:10.82]He does a very very good job.
[305:13.04]Thank you KillGannon though.
[305:13.84]Thank you WildHaBuddy for the one dollar.
[305:17.54]I had a dream I was streaming a Monster Hunter game, and had a few hundred viewers, and was really happy, and I looked at chat and everyone was just saying, just go.
[305:29.61]I was really happy, and then I saw just go, and then I became unhappy.
[305:35.37]Thank you, Mild, my buddy.
[305:38.95]Uh, Nock, thank you, Nock, for the one dollar, welcome back, Nock.
[305:42.01]Just wanted to say thank you for the EU stream, thanks, dude.
[305:47.52]I try.
[305:49.88]It's hard to do EU streams when you're... I don't really work that well during the day.
[305:55.71]And when I say work, I'm talking about just me as a human functioning.
[306:00.45]I do much better.
[306:01.59]I fare in much higher regard around this time.
[306:10.74]Waking up at, like, 10, 11 o'clock, like, not waking up, but, like, waking up at, like, 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning and getting to streaming at, like, 10, 11, 12 is usually not... I'm not, like, that energetic.
[306:24.15]I'm groggy.
[306:28.45]But I do like to try from time to time.
[306:31.13]I'm a night owl, as they say.
[306:34.92]But thank you.
[306:35.32]Thank you, Demilkmaster, for the one dollar.
[306:37.04]A dollar gets the caller.
[306:38.64]Garfield's caller, that is.
[306:39.76]Play Garfield card.
[306:40.74]Fourth message that he has sent about this.
[306:46.19]Brainwash, thanks for the one dollar.
[306:47.71]Jerma.
[306:48.51]A germalist.
[306:51.17]Isn't it supposed to be journalist, but a journal, like me?
[306:55.37]Thanks, dude.
[306:56.65]Uncle Frank's butter from his chest.
[307:00.83]Thanks for the $1.
[307:02.37]Gozu Boru, thanks for the $5.
[307:03.63]Hey, Jerma, just want to say thank you.
[307:04.95]I've been watching you since 2013, and you've always managed to make me laugh every time.
[307:09.31]You've helped me out so many times, you have no idea.
[307:11.00]You're truly a blessing in disguise, and I do mean that from the bottom of my heart.
[307:15.18]Also, you don't need to tell us that you appreciate us, because we already know.
[307:19.82]Much love and hope.
[307:23.46]Thanks for $5, first of all.
[307:27.86]Look, if I never told you guys that I appreciated what you do for me, and that you guys are here, every once in a while we talk about it.
[307:37.69]I just don't want you to forget.
[307:42.25]Once every month or two, I like to ring the dinner bell, and everyone gets around, and we just kind of talk about it.
[307:51.39]I appreciate that.
[307:52.01]Thank you.
[307:54.75]Much love to you.
[307:56.54]Corvid Moon, thanks for the $3.65.
[307:57.98]Jerma985 is an exceptionally expansive streamer with multiple jokes and chat interactions to encounter.
[308:05.86]I agree.
[308:07.40]Reptilian God, thanks for the $5.
[308:08.46]Hey, Jerma, the last couple months I've been pretty depressed over a breakup.
[308:12.03]Some days it was almost impossible to get out of bed, but your streams gave me something to look forward to during the day and helped me get through the weeks.
[308:19.11]I'm doing good now and have a new girlfriend and I'm very happy.
[308:21.45]Keep up the good work.
[308:23.58]That's great.
[308:25.09]Thank you, Reptilian God, for the $5.
[308:28.43]I'm glad you got over it.
[308:29.49]You got a new girlfriend.
[308:33.65]Sometimes it just happens.
[308:36.82]But it's not the end of the world.
[308:38.50]Anything that you think is the end of the world usually isn't.
[308:41.24]It's just some things are harder than others.
[308:44.02]I'm very glad that you got a new girlfriend, though.
[308:46.00]Hope you're very happy.
[308:46.90]It seems like you are.
[308:50.42]Just move forward.
[308:52.87]That's all you can do.
[308:55.83]Happy for you, man.
[308:59.33]Marvash Magali, thanks for the $1.
[309:01.45]Timmy Turner made a secret wish 50 years ago to stop everyone from aging so he can keep Wanda and Cosmo forever.
[309:08.48]He's 60 years old.
[309:09.60]You can spoil the fairly odd parents.
[309:11.16]I just did.
[309:11.62]Is that real?
[309:20.16]Did that actually happen?
[309:21.52]That's canon?
[309:22.86]In that universe?
[309:32.08]Yes, it's real.
[309:37.42]Why would there be that much deep Benjamin Button lore in the Fairly Oddparents?
[309:47.09]What is...
[309:49.42]Is this the Fairly Oddparents or a Christopher Nolan movie?
[309:52.84]What?
[309:55.00]Thank you, Styx.
[309:55.78]Welcome back, Styx.
[309:56.45]Renegade for the $1.
[309:57.39]He actually did get a girlfriend when he was like 20.
[309:59.77]Tootie, Vicky's sister, and he married her.
[310:01.77]Why do you guys know all this shit?
[310:06.75]Moo means moo.
[310:07.49]Thanks for the $1.
[310:08.31]Yeah, they may be like Santa, except it's a lot harder to murder the fairies.
[310:15.42]I guess you're right.
[310:17.14]You're right.
[310:18.33]Cosmo getting pregnant is also real.
[310:20.87]That's weird.
[310:25.47]Son of Jenova, thanks for the one dollar.
[310:26.63]I agree Cosmo was useless.
[310:28.07]I hated him as a kid.
[310:29.13]Swift rage.
[310:30.48]Though I hated Timmy too because of his annoying high-pitched voice.
[310:34.78]I'll try it.
[310:42.26]I'll get it.
[310:48.41]I'll try, I'm gonna get this.
[310:52.55]I can't do it.
[310:54.15]Thank you, MegaAgro, for the $15.
[310:56.61]Hey, Jerma, do you accept PayPal donations besides bits?
[311:00.90]Already answered it!
[311:01.88]Ethereum, cryptocurrency, if you understand how it works, and you have a basic understanding of that whole space.
[311:12.63]We talked about this before, but that's the only other thing I accept besides bits and subs.
[311:16.88]Bits, subs, and if you're, like, into cryptocurrency, and you get it, I take Ethereum.
[311:21.55]That's it.
[311:23.85]Thank you, though.
[311:27.79]Uh... Flubbergut, thanks for the $1.
[311:29.27]Dear Mr. Gerber, Jerry Jermerson, have you already decided on the next game you're gonna be streaming?
[311:33.56]If not, I highly recommend Far Cry 1, as it's the cheesiest FPS game I've ever played.
[311:37.28]It's definitely one you would enjoy.
[311:42.33]Never played Far Cry 1.
[311:44.15]I started at Far Cry 3.
[311:45.47]Oh, no, no, I think I started at Far Cry 4.
[311:51.88]I went three sequels in.
[311:58.36]But it's alright.
[311:59.73]I started at A New Hope.
[312:02.05]That's fine.
[312:03.23]Everybody started at A New Hope.
[312:05.89]You had to watch 3, 4, and 5.
[312:07.77]And then you go back and play 1, 2, and 3.
[312:10.67]That's fine.
[312:11.21]I'm not upset about that.
[312:15.81]Thank you, Son of Jenova, again for the $1.
[312:17.54]I agree that you should play Far Cry 1.
[312:19.86]Donkey did a video on that game and it's one of my favorites.
[312:24.50]Cool.
[312:25.76]I'll check if it's really that funny and that interesting.
[312:28.07]Maybe I'll check it out.
[312:31.44]Uncle Frank's... I'm just gonna say it.
[312:34.30]Uncle Frank's nipple butter.
[312:35.96]There you go.
[312:37.23]Number 145.
[312:38.05]One bit.
[312:39.31]One bit times 145.
[312:41.73]Thanks a lot, dude.
[312:43.97]$1.45.
[312:44.03]Number 15 is what they say.
[312:45.21]That's a lot of numbers.
[312:46.01]Thank you.
[312:47.25]Flubbergut, thanks for the $1.
[312:48.49]Things.
[312:49.68]One, would you consider playing Far Cry 1 in one of your streams?
[312:52.30]What's with the Far Cry 1?
[312:55.66]You aren't... Of course I'm gonna play Far Cry 1 now.
[313:01.26]Oh, it's Flubbogut again.
[313:07.49]I'd love to see it.
[313:08.01]Can you give a shout out to my boy Charlie who's watching you?
[313:10.17]Sure.
[313:10.43]Flubbogut, your friend Charlie.
[313:12.83]Shout out.
[313:14.01]Got it.
[313:16.80]I will give Far Cry 1 a look if it's that fun.
[313:20.72]Not dead mod, Kyle.
[313:21.54]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[313:22.50]Today's vegetable is radish.
[313:26.00]They are very good.
[313:26.74]I highly recommend you eat them.
[313:29.46]And you guys said there was no magic in this game.
[313:30.68]Oh, Kingdom Come Deliverance doesn't have any dragons or fairies or fireballs.
[313:33.61]This is levitation.
[313:34.23]That's in the game.
[313:56.99]Uh, thank you Tell Naga for the $4.
[313:58.71]Hey, hey, hey, Jeremiah, you always shorten my name, but I love you anyways.
[314:02.20]Have fun with Oblivion 2.
[314:05.00]Do I?
[314:08.02]Oh, yeah, no, I do.
[314:08.62]I just call you Tell.
[314:10.44]I do that to a lot of people, though.
[314:12.48]I usually cut people's names in half.
[314:16.16]Right?
[314:16.58]Like, for instance... There's at least, like, a dozen people here that I just call by... Tell.
[314:22.14]God.
[314:22.68]Moo.
[314:27.10]I say somebody's name wrong every, like, I say, like, for instance, E-Wart, Warty, Twerkwart.
[314:32.19]I have never pronounced that name correctly.
[314:34.27]And I usually just say E-Wart or E-Wart, Twerky, Warkwart.
[314:37.43]Every time.
[314:37.73]I cut people in half.
[314:43.49]But thank you, though, dude.
[314:45.50]Thank you also to MooMeansMoo again for the $1.
[314:49.72]Thank you, Moo.
[314:51.11]Figured now would be a good time to mention it, but I made a song for you to pee to.
[314:56.05]To go with the pee scream.
[314:57.19]I can't really post a link here since it'll get blocked, but it's on the Reddit if you want to take a listen.
[315:01.81]I will listen to it right after the stream.
[315:04.05]Absolutely.
[315:04.69]Thank you, Moo.
[315:06.77]God O. Thanks for the $4.
[315:08.67]What up, Jerma?
[315:09.21]Long time fan.
[315:09.79]Keep doing what you're doing.
[315:11.87]Appreciate it, God.
[315:12.81]Thank you.
[315:14.63]Flubba again.
[315:15.43]Thank you, Flubba, for the one dollar.
[315:17.01]And you say, last thing before I get off for the night, not sure if you saw the whining of my other two cheers, but I really want you to play Far Cry 1 in one of your streams.
[315:27.56]Love you, Jeremy boy.
[315:30.58]Now, when's your birthday?
[315:32.49]Whenever Flubba's birthday is, that's when I'm going to play Far Cry 1.
[315:36.15]That's it.
[315:36.43]I'm going to play it.
[315:37.79]It's going to be happy birthday to Flubba Gunn.
[315:41.89]Uh, Ass Nemesis.
[315:44.15]I don't, again, we're talking about names.
[315:45.72]I'm just going to call you Ass Man.
[315:46.80]Uh, Ass Man seal season since.
[315:51.88]Hi, Jermis R. for the Seek Bam.

[316:39.01]Because I have a mess.
[316:42.09]Hey, there he is!
[316:43.37]Thanks for the one dollar.
[316:44.76]I assume you're going to take an hour break.

[317:03.43]That's a long time.
[317:05.51]That is at least three years ago.
[317:19.40]Because, I mean, I haven't really done any TF2 stuff for at least a few years.
[317:25.08]But it's a great game.
[317:28.23]I hope some people are still enjoying it.
[317:30.33]It is one of the best.
[317:32.27]Thank you for the $10, though, dude.
[317:35.17]NotDeadModKyle thanks with 25 cents.
[317:36.85]Did you know the first french fries weren't actually cooked in France, they were cooked in Greece?
[317:41.05]All food comes from Greece.
[317:43.41]Every food you've ever eaten has its origins in Greece.
[317:46.67]Think about it.
