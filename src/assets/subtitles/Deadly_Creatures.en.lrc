[00:25.49]Right, right, right.
[00:26.15]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:27.53]I can't fucking make a joke on Twitter.
[00:32.59]Not allowed to make a joke on Twitter.
[00:34.34]That's what that was about.
[00:35.28]I mean, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:41.14]Season premiere.
[00:44.76]I am not going to eat a shoe.
[00:46.80]Like, at this point, the shoe thing is... That's like a channel joke at this point.
[00:52.74]That's a channel meme at this point.
[00:55.12]It doesn't mean anything.
[00:57.46]I'm not actually going to do that.
[00:59.39]If you think I'm actually going to do that, then come on.
[01:03.02]He lied again.
[01:03.68]I didn't lie about anything.
[01:06.26]We make jokes on this comedy stream!
[01:13.03]That's unfunny.
[01:13.93]Unfunny Riot.
[01:14.67]Riot, we trusted you.
[01:17.65]Just what?
[01:18.21]Hold on.
[01:19.61]Comrad Castro, thanks for the five.
[01:21.71]Community subs, appreciate it.
[01:27.38]You make a statement about fucking Sans in Smash Bros.
[01:37.98]One day I'm going to unsub from you.
[01:42.14]Jeff, one day I'm going to unsub from you.
[01:46.68]God damn it.
[01:50.08]Oh, God.
[01:51.70]Can we please get over this?
[01:53.23]Guys, as a community, can we... Alright, hold on.
[01:56.31]Can we please... Can we get over this as a community, please?
[02:03.99]Why is it so big?
[02:06.42]I look like I look professional right now.
[02:09.30]That shouldn't be happening.
[02:12.42]Nice hair.
[02:15.53]I can't get a haircut.
[02:19.79]I was actually thinking about this.
[02:21.13]I was thinking about going and I was going to have Kim do this for me.
[02:27.42]Oh shit, I moved that the wrong way.
[02:30.60]Can we get over this shit though?
[02:32.46]Please.
[02:32.62]Please.
[02:37.35]Yes, I'm still in the old place.
[02:39.77]But I got news for you.
[02:41.21]Every place in Vegas, whether it's an apartment, a house, or a condo, is the same house.
[02:48.28]They only make like three different places out here.
[02:56.86]When eventually I'm in a new place, you're going to be like, oh shit, that looks... I'm not even going to tell you when I move.
[03:02.33]You'll have to figure it out.
[03:06.10]Squeegee?
[03:06.70]Why are people saying squeegee?
[03:11.48]I know there's a delay.
[03:12.54]There should be.
[03:14.04]Because we're about to play the Wii.
[03:16.32]We had a pre-stream chat vote.
[03:18.44]It shouldn't be delayed.
[03:19.24]Hold on.
[03:24.02]Let me do this.
[03:26.30]It's going to look a little different for the first few minutes.
[03:29.97]It's delayed.
[03:30.71]You look sleepy?
[03:31.45]It's because I am.
[03:34.01]I got like a fucking weird neck.
[03:37.04]There's an extreme delay.
[03:40.42]Shoo, shoo, shoo.
[03:42.16]We gotta... Get it off!
[03:49.86]Is that what you want?
[03:52.92]Can we get over this, please?
[03:54.82]Can we get over this shit, please?
[03:57.42]If you think I'm gonna eat this, you're out of your fucking mind.
[04:07.32]Yeah, can I take a bite and will you guys get over this?
[04:12.62]If I take a bite of this, will you get over it?
[04:42.62]It's not as bad as I thought it was going to be.
[04:45.06]It tastes kind of like shit though.
[04:46.84]Wait a minute.
[04:47.26]No, I didn't step in shit.
[04:50.65]Relax.
[04:50.99]It was a joke.
[04:51.53]Okay, I'll take another bite of this shoe.
[05:00.64]This fucking shoe.
[05:02.74]I can't believe I'm...
[05:15.82]Eat the bottom.
[05:16.70]I'm not going to eat the bottom of the shoe.
[05:19.60]I'm going to do it the way that I want to do it, not the way that you want me to do it.
[05:34.75]You can't eat a whole shoe in five seconds.
[05:37.51]Holy shit, guys.
[05:40.51]Put it back on.
[05:51.65]I can't put it on.
[05:53.63]Not yet.
[05:54.19]I can't put it on.
[05:58.38]How about... Let me try over here.

[06:05.90]You don't wear socks.
[06:16.31]Fucking sans.
[06:23.55]He should never have been in the game.
[06:24.81]He's not even a Nintendo character.
[06:32.79]If Sans is in Smash Bros.
[06:34.41]now, then Scrooge McDuck better be next week.
[06:41.20]And I ain't need any more shoes for the new characters.
[06:53.05]Strong teeth?

[10:20.70]I can't, I can't.
[10:22.08]Okay, it's like when you order the Big Mac and you have to open your mouth really wide to take a bite, the first bite.
[10:29.24]The first bite of the Big Mac is always the worst one.
[10:52.69]I know this is what it tasted like.
[10:56.55]You're a freak.
[11:00.63]This is kind of weird, isn't it?
[11:03.47]This is real weird.
[11:05.89]This might be the weirdest thing I've done on stream ever.
[11:08.40]I've done a lot of fucking weird things.
[11:10.66]This is pretty odd, huh?
[11:12.88]Pretty odd.
[11:16.86]I'm gonna put it on.
[11:22.73]non-branded by the way I'm not go okay let me I'm gonna let's be let's be really clear here this is real close to being up okay I'm not going to like go like that okay that's this is real close nope this is real close
[11:49.50]To being weird.
[11:51.04]Like, really fucking weird.
[11:54.44]Oh, by the way, this stream can't be pre-recorded, can it?
[11:58.58]I'm gonna go put it on.
[12:05.36]I'm gonna put this shoe on, and I'm gonna walk around the room.
[12:08.56]Hold on, give me a second, give me a second.
[12:16.36]Those of you that don't think this is a real shoe.
[12:18.63]By the way, those of you scientists in the chat, a shoe could be classified as anything that protects your feet from the weather.
[12:25.39]Okay?
[12:25.53]Be right back.
[13:40.09]I gotta get this back on.
[13:41.03]It was on before.

[13:47.35]Hold on.
[13:53.88]Let me... Hold on.
[13:54.68]Let me move the camera so it's in a good spot.
[14:16.72]It's going to be the most fucked up image you're going to see all week.
[14:21.92]And it's already, it's only Monday.
[14:24.14]All right, let's put this back on.
[14:29.84]Let me just get my shoe back on.
[14:46.19]This is a cheap shoe.
[14:50.19]This is a cheap shoe.
[14:51.21]Imagine getting this shit in the fucking mail.
[15:04.48]Shoes.
[15:04.82]Oh, I got these new shoes.
[15:06.12]Oh, I lied, dude.
[15:06.98]They're supposed to be wicked comfortable.
[15:10.32]And it says this out of the box.
[15:14.07]You'd be so fucking mad.
[15:16.03]You'd be like, hold on, dude, how much were these?
[15:18.35]$220.
[15:18.45]What is it made out of?
[15:21.92]All right, goodbye.
[15:22.52]I'll be right back.
[15:23.60]I gotta clean this.
[15:24.26]I gotta clean my shoe up.
[15:25.10]Be right back.
[18:14.41]We're going to delete that one.
[18:15.41]What do we mean first time viewer?
[18:20.72]First time viewer.
[18:22.04]Oh, fucking God.
[18:24.28]Come on.
[18:24.82]I haven't started.
[18:29.87]What is first time viewer?
[18:38.41]Hold on.
[18:38.93]Wait, wait, wait.
[18:39.51]Let me see.
[18:40.63]Please watch.
[18:41.21]This is fucked up.
[18:43.35]What?
[18:43.51]Why is this fucked up?
[18:50.55]Oh, no.
[18:50.99]No.
[18:55.65]No.
[18:57.15]No.
[19:07.72]Wait, this isn't even what just happened.
[19:09.22]This is Ikaruga.
[19:12.85]What?
[19:16.43]What the fuck is this?
[19:18.51]Oh, no.
[19:18.91]I'm telling you, I can't... Oh, God.
[19:25.54]Who's this?
[19:26.36]Oh, no.
[19:30.96]Fuck, man.
[19:32.57]God damn it.
[19:43.34]I didn't mean to do that.
[19:44.72]It's in the same spot as this.
[19:48.34]Yeah, yeah, I know, I got it.
[19:51.56]Alright.
[19:56.01]I can assume this is like somebody with an incredibly realistic, totally, a reaction that makes perfect sense of the stupid fucking thing that I do on this stream sometimes.
[20:05.09]Let me see.
[20:10.80]This is probably gonna be an actual reaction that like a normal person would probably have.
[20:14.36]Let's see.
[20:20.85]So it looks like Deal or No Deal isn't really working.
[20:24.55]What the fuck is this?
[20:25.23]Who's this?
[20:44.81]I'm having it on for the next.
[20:47.94]This is it.
[20:49.84]All right, I'm gonna switch it to whatever fucking game that is.
[21:00.91]Why does he sound like that?
[21:02.21]So it looks like deal or no deal.
[21:15.30]why do I sound like he's right he's right he's got plenty of points look all right okay I just ate a shoe on camera if somebody finds the stream and they don't know what the the oh that's a perfectly normal reaction to have
[21:42.52]you're probably going to show me a clip tomorrow of somebody that found the stream today and there he is eating a shoe and like screaming okay well let's go to the next stream because I don't want to I'm not going to be here for this one why is he doing this hey by the way we're going to play the wii today
[22:13.12]Share the shoe clip.
[22:15.45]All that does is benefit me.
[22:17.51]You understand?
[22:19.03]That just brings me benefit.
[22:22.89]Maybe not socially.
[22:24.11]Maybe not socially.
[22:27.91]And Twitch TV sends and views sends numbers of how many clicks a video has received.
[22:34.66]Yeah.
[22:36.16]Doesn't help me out in any situation where I've got to meet some of these people at TwitchCon and say hello.
[22:45.63]Big bits, did we?
[22:47.07]Oh shit, hold on.
[22:52.91]Oh my god, I've been live for like almost 30 minutes.
[22:55.55]That's wicked funny, though.
[23:00.69]That's unbelievable.
[23:01.43]Oh my fucking god.
[23:04.03]Holy shit, so much money came in and I didn't even- I wasn't even looking at it.
[23:11.63]Wicked.
[23:12.07]I- Yes, I'm from a different part of the world than you.
[23:17.06]I say... I have different cadences.
[23:24.07]Anyways, Phylactery Lich.
[23:25.89]$50 from Phylactery.
[23:26.63]Huge fucking money.
[23:27.41]Ridiculous.
[23:28.57]You actually did it.
[23:29.19]It was worth the wait.
[23:29.99]Glad you're back.
[23:31.29]Good to be back.
[23:33.27]Good to be back.
[23:33.59]And we're going to talk about being back.
[23:34.73]We're going to talk about a few things.
[23:35.77]We're going to go over a new... That's right.
[23:38.32]A new... A new way I'm going to do the stream.
[23:42.66]I'm going to do it.
[23:43.88]What is he talking about here?
[23:44.70]What's that mean?
[23:45.20]Just hold on tight.
[23:47.50]You'll find out.
[23:49.46]Thanks for the 5,000 bits, dude.
[23:51.34]Seriously.
[23:51.82]It's a lot of money.
[23:52.98]Some of you guys have given stupid amounts of money.
[23:56.13]Today.
[23:58.61]And always.
[23:59.25]So, thanks.
[24:01.83]We also had 10,000 bits from GermaLiedAboutHalfLifeAlex.
[24:11.35]Hold on a second here.
[24:13.78]If this... Hold on a second here.
[24:17.21]Why do I have to be so much... Look, I get it, okay?
[24:19.84]I don't want to even look at these.
[24:23.60]There, that's better.
[24:28.54]Listen.
[24:31.88]All VR... VR will return.
[24:35.61]I just have to get a little bit stronger up here.
[24:38.01]And I have to get a little more less tight.
[24:40.75]I've actually been feeling a little better.
[24:42.69]But there's a reason for that, I think.
[24:44.09]And I've gone over it a few times.
[24:46.72]It's part of the reason why we're going to change the streams.
[24:49.24]This is an important stream.
[24:50.02]You don't want to miss this one.
[24:50.78]Stay tuned.
[24:51.18]Don't go anywhere.
[24:56.03]What is wrong with me?
[24:57.13]Why am I like this?
[24:58.29]That person's right.
[24:59.01]Why is he acting like this?
[24:59.83]I don't know.
[25:00.55]What the fuck am I doing?
[25:03.19]I'm excited.
[25:03.99]I'm very excited about a lot of things.
[25:05.91]But you're going to have to... I'm sorry.
[25:07.08]You're going to have to delete that account in probably like a couple months.
[25:10.02]That's the way it is.
[25:10.88]That's not going to make any sense in about one to two months.
[25:13.55]But thanks for the hundred bucks.
[25:15.23]Jerma lied about Half-Life Alyx.
[25:16.91]That's your name and that's your comment.
[25:20.66]Thank you.
[25:22.34]Thanks for the hundred fucking dollars.
[25:25.62]A great Canadian had $15.
[25:26.58]It's just, it's still a lot of money.
[25:29.32]Does that mean if I don't wash my socks for a few weeks, I can use them as shoes?
[25:34.08]No, because that doesn't protect you from the weather.
[25:36.18]Socks can get wet.
[25:37.40]Socks can, you can step on like a fucking rock and go like, ow, and like hurt your foot.
[25:41.36]That's not accurate.
[25:47.22]11M1 gave $100 in bits.
[25:51.83]10,000 bits.
[25:53.91]They say best joke of 2020.
[25:55.71]We'll see.
[25:59.15]We'll see.
[26:01.67]There might be some competition down the road here.
[26:04.59]Or worst joke.
[26:05.19]Oh, no, that was best joke.
[26:06.23]Right.
[26:06.47]Oh, sorry.
[26:06.91]Yeah, of course it was.
[26:08.43]Best joke of 2020.
[26:09.61]Thank you.
[26:10.81]Thanks for the $100.
[26:14.82]Freddie Dredd gave 200 fucking dollars.
[26:16.79]We get like thousands of dollars from Freddie Dredd.
[26:21.57]Thanks a lot, Freddie.
[26:22.49]It's fucking, that's insane.
[26:24.41]That's 200 fucking dollars instantly.
[26:26.57]Just like that.
[26:27.43]Dropped into my Twitch bank account.
[26:29.87]Thank you.
[26:30.41]It's insane.
[26:31.45]Thank you.
[26:31.97]It's fucking a ton of money.
[26:34.76]No message either.
[26:35.62]Filactory, another $50.
[26:36.62]Oh my God.
[26:37.10]What?
[26:37.36]All right.
[26:42.73]That's a lot of money.
[26:44.33]That's a lot of money.
[26:47.27]Another $50.
[26:47.77]Dude, that dude was so upset that your stream had more viewers than him.
[26:52.01]I don't think that's accurate.
[26:53.43]I don't think that's accurate.
[26:56.27]We don't want to put words in other streamers' mouths.
[26:57.97]We don't want to do that.
[26:58.67]And that's not what we do here.
[27:00.09]I don't think that's necessarily accurate.
[27:01.35]I don't think that's accurate.
[27:02.41]Okay, sorry.
[27:02.93]Don't worry.
[27:03.37]There's no problem here.
[27:08.16]Thanks for the $50.
[27:10.73]Comrade Castro, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[27:14.53]You're looking good today, Jeremy.
[27:15.63]I hope you're enjoying your time in quarantine.
[27:17.17]Keep up your streams.
[27:18.12]Love you.
[27:20.24]Thanks a lot, Castro.
[27:23.04]We're doing our best, right?
[27:25.32]Everybody's trying to do their best during this whole scenario, so I hope you are as well.
[27:30.69]And then we had five community subs from Yellow Jello Fellow.
[27:34.63]That's five subs.
[27:40.54]That's a lot of money.
[27:41.88]That just came in.
[27:43.64]Oh, right, okay.
[27:44.60]Now, let's talk about some things.
[27:46.38]Okay, here we go.
[27:47.22]You ready?
[27:48.51]I have to give you a... I'm not going to say the thing.
[27:51.13]I'm going to say just, hey, let's talk about something.
[27:53.01]I'm not going to say, I have... That's 10 subs from Snarbosis and 10 subs from Nondescript Civilian.
[28:00.57]Thank you guys, both of you.
[28:04.90]Thanks for the fucking 20 subs back-to-back.
[28:08.17]Well, I am back, and we should be back to kind of normal here, but what's normal?
[28:12.65]This is the new stream schedule.
[28:14.73]This is what's going to happen.
[28:16.14]I've noticed over the last six months or so, because if you don't know, let's just go over very quickly TLDR.
[28:22.96]I have an issue with my rib cage in my spine.
[28:27.54]I have some problem.
[28:28.68]We don't know if it's costochondritis, if I have arthritis.
[28:31.56]We don't exactly know exactly what's causing it, but we do have an idea, right?
[28:36.33]I've noticed over the last couple weeks of not really streaming that much, right?
[28:41.44]So I've been moving around, Kim and I have been packing boxes, we've been moving, and I feel a little looser.
[28:49.26]And we did some streams that were shorter, that were like three or four hours last week and the week before that.
[28:56.21]And
[28:58.24]I'm a little looser.
[28:59.94]And I think what I'm coming to the conclusion of, and this is what I've had discussions with this very thing, is how do you say this word?
[29:08.27]Sedientary?
[29:11.65]The word where you sit down for a long time.
[29:14.11]What's it called?
[29:17.79]Phonetically.
[29:18.25]I'm stupid.
[29:18.83]Phonetically.
[29:19.27]Sedentary.
[29:22.27]Sedentary?
[29:22.95]Sedentary.
[29:23.99]Sedentary.
[29:29.75]Sedentary.
[29:33.73]So when I sit here sedentary for more than four, five, six plus hours, it hurts a lot.
[29:42.93]And I've noticed that the shorter streams, it doesn't hurt as much.
[29:48.87]It's easier when I move around.
[29:50.05]I can stay moving.
[29:50.91]I can stay mobile.
[29:52.35]So here's what I've decided to do.
[29:58.33]Wait, alright, I'm streaming.
[29:59.17]I forgot.
[29:59.89]Um, here's what I've decided to do.
[30:02.41]What's gonna happen here is instead of six to eight hour streams, three or four days a week, I'm gonna pull it back to like four to six hour streams, four to five days a week.
[30:20.68]So there's going to be short, and I've said this before, like, hey, I'm going to do shorter streams, but more, we're going to pull back times and stream more often.
[30:29.53]Because doing like four to six hours and then being able to get up and move around and I don't have to sit still for a very long time, it helps a lot.
[30:40.66]And I've been noticing a very, very huge difference only because I haven't been streaming.
[30:44.94]And the streams I've been doing have been short.
[30:47.44]So I'm going to keep that up.
[30:48.42]I'm going to see if it helps.
[30:49.14]I'm going to see if it works.
[30:51.37]So yeah, you can expect instead of like three, seven to eight hour plus streams, you'll get like four or five, like four to six hours.
[31:01.71]Starting now, starting until I decide I want to change it or do something else.
[31:05.15]It was also the idea that it was also the idea that I would stream potentially twice a day.
[31:15.87]So.
[31:17.86]Instead of a four to six hour stream five days a week, maybe I do like two to three hours.
[31:24.06]Take like a 30, 40 plus minute break and come back in an hour, get some food and come back and do like another two or three hours.
[31:32.17]I just have to move around.
[31:33.29]I have to.
[31:34.47]There's also the idea of maybe get a standing desk.
[31:37.63]But the reason why I don't want to do two streams in a day is because... I like... I burn up quickly.
[31:43.97]I know that a lot of you guys understand.
[31:45.05]You guys get that.
[31:45.63]And a lot of you guys know that by now.
[31:48.63]So some of these streams were very high energy.
[31:51.22]And after like three, four plus hours, like... It's like a... What's a good analogy to describe?
[31:57.98]Like something that like lights up real quick and then it's gone.
[32:02.19]So if I were to do a funnel...
[32:06.27]Fireworks.
[32:07.05]Okay.
[32:07.26]Yeah.
[32:07.96]No, but I don't want to say that.
[32:10.46]That's like a cheesy analogy.
[32:13.32]I'm a firework.
[32:14.78]Oh, no, you're not.
[32:17.00]You eat potato chips on the fucking couch all day.
[32:19.92]Like, relax.
[32:23.10]But if I stream like three or four hours and then I go take like a two-hour break, I might just like lose all my energy and that'll be it.
[32:34.13]You're a sneeze.
[32:36.74]Yeah, it comes out real quick and really strong.
[32:42.86]And it's, no, but it's like, it feels like kind of good for a second.
[32:48.22]And then you don't, after like three or four, you're like, I want this to be over.
[32:53.36]But that doesn't make any sense because everyone around you doesn't want to be around you.
[32:57.30]You guys want to be around me?
[32:58.74]You know what I'm saying?
[32:59.50]I don't think that works.
[33:02.62]Who's the sneeze in this scenario?
[33:04.36]Don't drop anything.
[33:06.52]you're in no okay anyways I'm going to change the schedule we're not changing oh I'm going to do monday tuesday wednesday thursday or thursday friday saturday sunday monday no the days are going to be just kind of whenever they will be brief like no more than that like four times five times in a row maybe four times three times a day off and then one day uh two days I don't know up rocks yeah
[33:36.48]yeah he's still going to be late guaranteed absolutely probably every day okay are you ready so today we're gonna do we're gonna start this deadly creatures this was voted on by pre-stream chat oh and I'll give you I can give you this week right now are you ready for this week's schedule today nothing tomorrow wednesday thursday friday and maybe saturday
[34:05.78]There you go.
[34:06.94]I just gave it to you.
[34:07.66]Do you like when I do eye contact?
[34:10.64]Do you like when I look at you?
[34:11.52]Because right now I'm giving you eye contact right now.
[34:15.84]Like this is eye contact.
[34:17.62]But this is me looking into the webcam.
[34:20.52]Which one do you like more?
[34:21.19]Because like I'm reading your text.
[34:22.69]That's eye contact to the screen for your text.
[34:28.85]Webcam like this.
[34:31.75]Like that, like addressing you directly.
[34:36.18]I'll give you three spots.
[34:38.04]Right here.
[34:40.00]Right here.
[34:40.30]You know what you can always tell when someone's not looking at you directly in the eyes?
[34:44.44]When somebody's not doing eye contact, but they're like pretending to, right?
[34:48.06]Where instead of like this, like this.
[34:53.85]I do that all the time.
[34:55.99]I do that.
[34:56.45]I do that shit all the time.
[35:01.05]You look over like right over there, like right where their eye could be.
[35:06.41]It's hard.
[35:09.13]I'm not bad with eye contact, but it's hard for me to do it for a long period in a row.
[35:14.96]Like this, if I'm talking to somebody like this and we're having a conversation, I have to be looking around and like, oh, yeah.
[35:23.63]So I can't believe it.
[35:24.51]Yeah, it's unbelievable.
[35:25.67]I can't do it.
[35:26.93]I just get- I get- I get, like, bored of looking at somebody's eyes.
[35:29.65]I have to, like, look all over the room.
[35:31.55]There could be a crack in the wall right there.
[35:32.99]I just saw it.
[35:33.43]Should get that fixed.
[35:35.57]Oh, sorry.
[35:35.97]Let me look in your eyes and tell you that.
[35:38.31]That's ADHD.
[35:39.33]Yeah, probably.
[35:40.33]Yeah, definitely.
[35:41.93]Alright.
[35:42.49]I'm gonna get the fuck out of here.
[35:43.75]And we're gonna play.
[35:44.37]Because why do I need a face cam?
[35:46.35]That's unnecessary.
[35:47.15]Why can I- oh.
[35:48.67]Maybe you have a cracked lip?
[35:51.11]Do I?
[35:54.14]Another 50 fucking dollars just came in.
[35:56.20]You guys are nuts!
[35:58.48]50 more fucking dollars!
[36:00.22]Holy shit, thank you.
[36:03.39]Do I need chapstick?
[36:04.21]Do I?
[36:05.29]Uh, this is by Sigmatic.
[36:06.37]Thank you, Sigmatic.
[36:09.63]For the 50 fucking dollars.
[36:13.61]Come back, come back, come back.
[36:18.65]There once was a streamer from Peru whose chat wanted him to eat a shoe.
[36:23.63]He looked up at his cam, shook his head and said, damn, as it seemed that the joke had come true.
[36:30.29]That's pretty good.
[36:37.73]All right, now I gotta, I gotta hold on.
[36:39.45]I gotta... That's pretty fucking good.
[36:48.23]This is Deadly Creatures.
[36:49.09]This is voted on.
[36:49.67]This is for the Wii.
[36:50.25]This is a game where you play as mean, scary bugs like tarantulas and scorpions and bees and shit.
[36:57.20]And apparently, it's very good.
[37:00.06]I have heard this is a cult classic Nintendo Wiimote game.
[37:04.10]It's supposed to be very good and very fun.
[37:07.75]We're gonna play.
[37:12.91]Here we go.
[37:16.16]Make sure you don't put a hole through your monitor.
[37:18.64]That would be bad.
[37:20.32]Why is there always a vase?
[37:24.44]I can't... What do you got a vase that close in the living room for?
[37:28.08]Does anybody have a house that has that?
[37:32.73]Where there's just a gigantic pillar with a vase on it?
[37:37.17]Like right next to the couch?
[37:38.47]Or like right next to the coffee table?
[37:42.95]That's... Yes, people do that.
[37:45.09]That's aesthetic.
[37:49.69]Vase.
[37:50.99]Vase, vase, vase.
[37:52.83]I have an accent.
[37:55.13]I'm from the city of Boston.
[37:57.73]I talk like this.
[38:05.21]Deadly creatures.
[38:07.54]Rated R. Let's do adventure.
[38:12.72]Empty.
[38:14.80]Are you sure you want to create save one?
[38:17.60]I'm pretty sure I do.
[38:22.01]Chapter 1, Scavengers.
[38:24.34]New.
[38:25.12]Leaf crickets and grubs.
[38:29.80]This is gonna be fucked up.
[38:31.92]Play easy.
[38:33.28]Play normal.
[38:33.88]Play deadly.
[38:35.74]Uh... We don't really... Oops.
[38:39.94]What the fuck do we have to prove?
[38:41.74]I'm just gonna play on normal.
[38:44.67]Deadly.
[38:45.05]I'm not doing... Why would I do that?
[38:50.47]Do deadly or don't play.
[38:54.02]Let me turn this up a little.
[38:58.30]Greed can poison a man's soul.
[39:01.21]Turn him into something he ain't.
[39:02.51]This is Billy Bob Thornton.
[39:03.85]Make him deadly.
[39:06.37]Even more deadly than the vermin that run underfoot out here.
[39:12.56]I wouldn't say I got my revenge.
[39:14.90]Didn't have much part in that.
[39:16.26]Playing deadly creatures on normal.
[39:17.56]That old gas station seen us last day.
[39:21.01]Well, that was a good thing.
[39:22.91]Faulty gas... Turn the game up.
[39:24.59]Hold on.
[39:26.53]No matter what the news said.
[39:29.81]The cops found a stash of gold coins with Spanish writing on them.
[39:33.93]Why is it so quiet?
[39:34.51]I'm not one to go believing in cursed treasure.
[39:37.22]I think it was just my bad choices and bad instincts that got me this time.
[39:42.12]Same as always.
[39:43.96]Same as always.
[39:44.88]And George Struggs?
[39:46.70]The cops ask him what happened right before he- How much do you think Billy Bob Thorne charges an hour?
[39:50.81]He kept mumbling something about deadly creatures.
[39:55.82]There we go.
[39:56.46]Is that better?
[39:57.08]There we go.
[39:58.98]Now you can hear it.
[40:02.58]Alright, I need this back.
[40:12.95]Now I can see.
[40:14.19]We're ignoring the lore.
[40:15.25]I mean, I'm not really ignoring the lore as much.
[40:18.73]That was just Billy Bob Thornton just saying a bunch of words.
[40:22.73]This is all I heard from that.
[40:24.39]We had all sorts of trouble when we saw the law and then we saw this thing and that was the day that... I didn't hear anything, it was words.
[40:36.29]Oh shit, it's a... Scorpion versus spider.
[40:50.62]Who wins?
[40:54.05]Definitely the scorpion.
[40:56.03]Why is this screen all the way up there?
[41:05.97]Oh shit, what did I do?
[41:07.36]Here we go.
[41:13.26]Sick.
[41:13.52]Alright, so I play as the spider.
[41:15.70]Okay, this is a- Okay, strike.
[41:22.05]Press the A button to strike.
[41:24.41]There's a locust right here.
[41:26.14]Got him.
[41:27.94]I'm ready to turn the brightness up.
[41:29.06]This is a little dark.
[41:29.66]Hold on.
[41:30.18]Wait.
[41:32.92]Okay, that's pretty good.
[41:35.38]Do we have to fight the humans?
[41:37.14]Press down on the control pad to reset the camera behind you.
[41:40.72]Useful.
[41:41.83]It's not dark for us, is it?
[41:43.23]No?
[41:43.53]Okay.
[41:44.25]Maybe it's supposed to be like this.
[41:51.38]This is pretty cool, alright.
[41:52.46]Do I just eat everything?
[41:54.05]Is this a game about eating stuff?
[41:58.61]Info window is 1 out of 450.
[42:03.72]A skull icon appears in the upper left.
[42:05.64]When new info is available, press the minus button at any time to view the information window.
[42:10.28]Press left or right on the control pad to scroll through the messages.
[42:14.50]Grubs can be found hidden throughout the world.
[42:16.44]Approach a grub to feed on it and regain a small amount of health.
[42:19.64]As you collect more grubs, you will unlock concept art galleries.
[42:24.71]Which can be... You lost me.
[42:28.25]You lost me.
[42:29.49]It's not like, oh, you get a health upgrade or you get that max damage.
[42:31.85]No, I don't.
[42:32.57]You lost me.
[42:32.99]I mean, that's cool, but I stopped reading after that just because I don't... I mean, that's pretty cool.
[42:41.69]Alright, I'll get rid of this.
[42:44.23]It's concept art.
[42:44.95]I know, it's cool, but I thought it was going to do something to the game.
[42:47.69]Somebody just gave 50 fucking subs.
[42:52.80]50.
[42:53.94]50 community subs.
[42:56.38]That was Fatal Finale.
[42:59.20]Fatal Finale.
[43:02.54]Fatal Finale.
[43:05.18]Fatal Finale.
[43:09.31]Ooh, our first enemy.
[43:12.23]Beetle.
[43:14.98]Oh, shit.
[43:17.00]Holy fuck.
[43:19.14]What is it?
[43:19.44]Oh, it's a stag beetle.
[43:20.47]Really?
[43:21.41]Alright, let's go.
[43:22.07]Oh, fuck.
[43:23.17]Alright.
[43:23.41]Is there a lock-on?
[43:39.94]Holy shit!
[43:41.22]Hold on, spiders throw fucking haymakers?
[43:44.79]What?
[43:50.99]Wow, okay.
[43:53.33]Wait, there's grumps.
[43:54.55]Should I get these?
[43:55.11]Okay, get them.
[44:05.73]Might as well.
[44:06.47]We'll see some concept art.
[44:09.16]You can climb on the walls, too?
[44:11.70]Oh, man.
[44:12.78]That's definitely the secret power of the spider.
[44:20.01]Yeah, that's definitely the spider's secret power.
[44:23.75]Is to be able to just appear in your peripheral vision.
[44:28.13]And have you go... That's a spider right there in my peripheral.
[44:32.10]That's a spider right there in my... I knew it!
[44:33.88]And it's right fucking next to me.
[44:38.06]Yep, that's their power.
[44:42.48]It's not really a secret, Jeremy.
[44:44.58]You didn't say Jeremy, I just- I said Jeremy.
[44:48.23]Oh, press Z to jump!
[44:51.19]Is this a jump?
[44:53.85]What the fuck?
[44:57.65]Wow, okay.
[44:58.63]Another five subs from Chris Bok.
[45:02.60]Thank you, Chris Bok, for the five community subs.
[45:09.06]Do you actually have to eat, like, fight people?
[45:14.56]Oh, fuck.
[45:15.22]Okay.
[45:16.36]Wait.
[45:16.84]Oh.
[45:18.38]That was just a loading zone.
[45:19.58]Should I jump over this?
[45:22.94]Wait, there's a beetle down there.
[45:25.36]Can I do a falling R1?
[45:30.00]Red... Another $50.
[45:31.72]Holy shit.
[45:36.08]Red Planet of Mars gave $50 fucking dollars.
[45:39.40]Another $50.
[45:42.72]For the chat's sanity, say the line and sing the tune, you know the one.
[45:47.72]I did.
[45:49.69]Get up.
[45:50.21]Shake the Wiimote to get up quickly after being hit.
[45:52.37]Oh.
[45:55.81]Alright, this is fucking actually pretty fun.
[45:57.97]Is there a lock-on?
[46:07.97]Oh my god.
[46:11.43]Jesus Christ.
[46:15.03]That's 69 subs from phylactery dollar signs.
[46:24.72]69 community subs.
[46:27.24]This is fucking into the thousands of dollars right now.
[46:31.30]Holy shit, guys.
[46:32.14]Thank you.
[46:33.02]That's insane.
[46:33.58]This is actually fucking crazy.
[46:36.85]Thanks for the fucking almost 100 subs, dude.
[46:40.91]And you're collectively like 15,000 total probably more dollars you've given the stream.
[46:47.92]Maybe even like 20 grand at this point.
[46:50.16]It's insane.
[46:57.65]Do I have to stalk anybody?
[47:06.57]Oh man.
[47:09.52]Boss fight.
[47:10.12]This is the tutorial boss.
[47:11.06]Has to be.
[47:12.92]Holy shit, it is.
[47:15.19]Oh, what do I do?
[47:16.13]What do I do?
[47:16.41]What do I do?
[47:16.75]What do I do?
[47:17.75]How do you fight a spider?
[47:19.21]I mean a... Oh, fight his tail.
[47:25.69]Wait.
[47:30.57]Oh, it's... Jesus.
[47:33.42]Alright, do it again.
[47:34.00]Is there a dodge?
[47:34.98]Dodge?
[47:37.90]Jesus.
[47:38.34]Is there a block or anything?
[47:39.32]How do I get up there?
[47:39.88]I gotta crawl up.
[47:42.32]I gotta jump up.
[47:47.51]Ah!
[47:47.93]How do I do this?
[47:49.03]How do I do this?
[47:49.55]Equip a shield.
[47:54.57]He's blocking his tail.
[47:58.45]Walk on the wall?
[47:59.98]I can't.
[48:08.11]Oh.
[48:08.97]Dodge the rattlesnake's strikes by jumping out of the way after it hisses.
[48:12.45]So Z is dodge.
[48:15.47]There it is.
[48:17.85]I thought Z was jump.
[48:20.92]Here we go.
[48:26.04]He's bat-rolling.
[48:29.34]Dodge!
[48:32.48]Alright.
[48:32.92]Probably one more?
[48:47.14]Put your tail down.
[48:53.24]Darn it.
[48:56.32]Dumb idiot fucking moron, idiot snake.
[49:01.90]Oh shit.
[49:04.39]One more to the right.
[49:08.55]I don't think you can kill the snake, no.
[49:09.71]Look at those eyes.
[49:16.61]Aren't tarantulas poisonous?
[49:21.12]If you get bit by a tarantula, doesn't it kill you?
[49:24.24]What kind of tarantula am I?
[49:30.42]Some are.
[49:32.78]Did I miss something?
[49:39.73]No, no, if you get bit by a tarantula, you turn into stone, right?
[49:42.97]You, like, turn into a rock person.
[49:46.09]But that's Medusa.
[49:48.01]Um... What happens to you?
[49:57.24]Complete adventure goals as you progress through the game to earn points.
[49:59.92]Only one adventure goal is active at a time.
[50:01.90]It's a quest?
[50:03.82]You are actually correct.
[50:04.80]Yeah.
[50:11.36]So what's the goal right now?
[50:12.82]You can also hunt and kill enemies to complete predator goals and earn points.
[50:17.09]As you earn points, you will automatically unlock upgrades and new combat moves for your character.
[50:21.45]Your current adventure goal and the predator goals for the current chapter are listed on the adventure status page with the plus button to view the pause menu and select adventure status.
[50:34.74]Okay.
[50:37.18]Predator goals.
[50:38.56]We have beetles.
[50:40.05]Oh, there's a wolf spider.
[50:42.53]No current goals.
[50:43.87]An ex-combat upgrade, so you have 150 points.
[50:46.11]Okay.
[50:47.13]I don't have any goals.
[50:48.71]No adventure goals.
[50:51.21]Okay.
[50:51.41]I need full health here.
[51:00.02]Why is his voice like that?
[51:02.26]Stop!
[51:03.92]What the hell was that?
[51:04.70]Fight him!
[51:05.58]Fight him!
[51:06.04]Bite his leg!
[51:14.47]Crack the scorpion.
[51:21.09]What the fuck?
[51:23.77]Who crashed their motorcycle?
[51:31.45]Whose web is this?
[51:32.10]This is not my web.
[51:36.36]Can I get over this?
[51:42.46]How do I get out of here?
[51:51.12]There we go.
[51:54.40]Oh, shit.
[51:54.80]Alright.
[51:55.18]Jump strike.
[51:56.48]Press the... Oh, they actually fight each other, too.
[51:58.39]It's another spider.
[51:59.03]I actually don't like that.
[51:59.89]I hate that.
[52:01.83]I don't like that.
[52:02.39]Okay, I... You... Okay, I'm being dead serious here.
[52:06.45]A tarantula... You could have ten tarantulas crawl all over my face and crawl in my mouth and shit, and I wouldn't even care.
[52:12.17]But just a regular wolf spider, like house spider?
[52:14.77]They scare the fucking shit out of me.
[52:17.02]I hate... I don't like them.
[52:19.67]I don't know what it is.
[52:21.23]They're weirder somehow.
[52:25.04]I don't like that thing.
[52:25.70]I don't like that.
[52:26.46]I would let my character crawl in my mouth.
[52:29.28]I would not let that touch me.
[52:30.36]I would run away from that.
[52:32.80]I hate it.
[52:33.14]I don't like it.
[52:36.61]I don't like it.
[52:37.05]It's trying to kill me.
[52:41.67]They block too.
[52:44.15]How do you jump and attack like this?
[52:52.54]Ah, fuck.
[52:54.02]It's the legs, probably.
[52:55.10]What was that tooltip?
[52:56.36]It was to jump and... Ow, I just bumped you.
[53:10.99]This is the Dark Souls of bugs, kind of.
[53:17.28]Oh, it was Z and then A, right?
[53:20.34]Yeah, it was.
[53:21.38]Oh, shit!
[53:22.12]That's how you get them to stop, uh, blocking?
[53:26.28]Alright, that's it, right?
[53:32.85]You lost a roach wheel.
[53:35.63]Move unlocked.
[53:36.31]Spin attack.
[53:37.53]Swing the Wiimote left or right to launch a spin attack.
[53:46.26]That's so cool.
[53:48.40]It's not roach wheel.
[53:51.91]Thank you, TranScout, for the 5,000.
[53:53.81]You guys are just dropping 50 fucking dollars a shitload of times.
[53:59.49]Another 5,000 bits.
[54:05.41]Tarantula in mouth on stream or riot.
[54:08.57]I probably could.
[54:09.87]I would be fine.
[54:12.48]If you had, like, a doctor and, like, two, like, zoologists tell me that if this bit me inside my mouth, I'd be fine.
[54:20.62]I would let it happen.
[54:21.18]I'd be like, that's fine.
[54:22.46]I would do it.
[54:27.77]I would let a tarantula crawl in my mouth.
[54:29.05]I would.
[54:30.23]But why would you do that?
[54:31.09]That's, like, stupid and dangerous and there's a scorpion.
[54:33.69]Scorpions get the shit out of me, too.
[54:40.91]And the worst part about scorpions is out here.
[54:43.81]Out here in Vegas.
[54:46.05]It's not the big ones.
[54:47.19]The big ones are not a problem.
[54:49.01]They're not... They may be scary looking, but they're not really the big ones out here.
[54:53.09]It's the bark scorpions that are the problem.
[54:54.99]They're tiny.
[54:56.27]They're like an inch and a half long.
[54:58.21]Maybe an inch long.
[54:59.25]They're flat.
[55:00.37]And they're fucking poisonous.
[55:04.37]And they're everywhere.
[55:05.65]They're like these orange little flat scorpions.
[55:08.58]And they're fucking poisonous.
[55:11.41]Bark scorpions.
[55:14.15]Thank you to... Somebody that's on... Thank you on fire for the 10 community subs.
[55:24.06]Thank you... Why can I... I can't say this.
[55:28.18]I don't know why.
[55:30.68]Thanks for the 10 subs, though.
[55:35.21]That's tits.
[55:36.03]Tits on fire.
[55:36.73]There you go.
[55:37.53]Thanks for the 10 subs.
[55:39.44]Hold the 2 button to bring up the hint arrow.
[55:41.62]The hint arrow always points towards the location of your current adventure goal.
[55:44.30]That's awesome.
[55:47.12]I mean, like, seriously, what a fucking good game this is so far.
[55:49.74]I'm liking it.
[55:55.64]Oop.
[55:57.48]What do you think you're gonna do here?
[56:00.40]Get spin attacked, motherfucker.
[56:04.89]Dead?
[56:08.29]Alright, we're good.
[56:10.91]The idea of it being an insect fighting world is so cool.
[56:14.01]It is pretty cool.
[56:21.64]Nice.
[56:24.00]I'm assuming I get new combos too eventually here.
[56:26.43]That's pretty cool.
[56:32.34]This plays pretty well, too.
[56:33.96]It's actually, the combat's kind of fun.
[56:37.02]It's very, very basic, but it's very simple, it's very good.
[56:41.40]This is what bugs do when you're not looking.
[56:45.04]Yes, actually, it kind of is.
[56:47.52]This is what bugs do when you're not looking.
[56:52.07]I think we've talked about this before, but bugs are just in a constant, constant state of war.
[56:56.83]Always.
[57:00.07]Like bugs are living in like World War II times a million every day.
[57:12.23]And, let's think about World War II, how many countries were involved, how many people were involved.
[57:18.50]Like, imagine in the bug world we're talking about, not like 20, 30, 40 different countries, we're talking about maybe 6 to 7 million different species all fighting at the same time.
[57:32.17]So it's like 20 million countries all fighting together at the same time, like 50 million times the conflict in World War II.
[57:41.16]Just every day.
[57:41.76]In your fucking backyard, you don't even know it.
[57:43.66]Just under the soil this shit's happening.
[57:58.13]Ooh, secret.
[58:00.13]Constant conflict.
[58:01.23]Yeah.
[58:02.65]It is.
[58:03.07]That is a bug's life.
[58:04.93]That movie that they made, A Bug's Life, where they, like, drink coffee and, like, go to the fucking grocery store?
[58:09.83]No, no, no, no, no.
[58:10.97]That movie would be accurate if it was just, like, fighting and swords and screaming and shit.
[58:17.09]Where is this guy?
[58:20.32]Up here?
[58:26.40]Is that gonna get, like, in the tree trunk?
[58:31.35]Ants.
[58:32.47]A bug's life.
[58:39.69]How do I get in here?
[58:40.69]Can I climb it?
[58:46.55]No, underneath.
[58:49.11]Wait, hold on.
[58:50.55]I gotta get, like, in.
[58:51.31]There we go.
[58:52.03]Alright, we're in.
[58:55.81]What about Bee Movie?
[58:56.33]Bee Movie.
[58:58.70]Yeah, B-movie's not accurate either.
[59:00.24]They're in a constant state of war with other, like, hives and wasps and shit.
[59:05.52]They don't drive around in cars.
[59:06.66]Alright, up, roll, okay, gotta keep going up.
[59:17.59]Look, pull the one button and point the Wii remote at the screen.
[59:22.09]Oh, that's gonna be annoying, but okay.
[59:25.09]Where is he?
[59:26.86]Is he gonna be like up on a mountain somewhere?
[59:28.64]He's gonna be at the top of a cliff.
[59:31.60]I guarantee it.
[59:32.28]He's gonna zoom in on him.
[59:34.48]What if he was behind me?
[59:39.42]Where is this motherfucker?
[59:47.50]If I was a bug, what bug would you want to be?
[59:50.28]Um... That's very easy.
[59:56.09]Um, what's the shit that when you lift up a rock, there's a bunch of them.
[59:59.21]They're like the silver ones.
[60:01.26]Like if you, if you were going to like in your garage and you lift up like an old mat that's on the ground and there's like, yeah, like the silverfish.
[60:11.63]Yep.
[60:13.09]Like if you go in your backyard and it like rained last week, and you lift up like the damp rock and there's like just a hundred silverfish, that's what I would want to be.
[60:20.03]Because they're safe and they're protected.
[60:22.49]And they just exist under there.
[60:24.75]You want to be one of the bugs that just exists.
[60:33.15]People go, oh man, I would want to be a scorpion.
[60:35.91]I'd want to be a spider.
[60:36.95]I would be a praying mantis.
[60:40.11]Really?
[60:40.31]Really?
[60:44.37]No, you don't.
[60:48.99]What am I supposed to be looking at here?
[60:50.13]Over there?
[60:51.05]Is that him?
[60:53.91]Roly-polies or silverfish?
[60:55.38]Is he down?
[60:59.06]Where is this guy?
[61:00.66]He's definitely down here.
[61:02.44]Yep.
[61:04.46]I hate those things.
[61:07.17]I hate those things.
[61:08.53]I hate them.
[61:10.81]Oh, I don't like the way they move.
[61:12.01]I don't like the way they walk.
[61:19.12]Oh, I don't like the way they fucking wiggle their legs.
[61:25.80]And they have velociraptor noises, too.
[61:28.06]I... Why do you have to make them so fucked up?
[61:37.86]Ow.
[61:40.40]Oh, he's kicking my ass.
[61:41.38]Alright, give him a haymaker.
[61:47.43]Good.
[61:49.49]This game needs a sequel or a remaster.
[61:51.21]Who made this game?
[61:53.81]What company actually made this?
[61:54.85]This is pretty cool.
[61:56.75]This is a really great idea.
[61:58.53]I wish they had, like, a hundred million more dollars.
[62:01.11]Was it THQ?
[62:01.79]That doesn't surprise me.
[62:02.91]THQ made a bunch of awesome, cool, like, interesting games.
[62:07.09]Why is it always the companies?
[62:08.31]Why is it the company that makes, like, the cool shit that has to be the one that gets liquidated?
[62:11.13]You know what I'm saying?
[62:13.56]Like, what the fuck is up with that?
[62:25.69]Oh, I can shoot a web?
[62:28.03]Point at the screen with the Wiimote, hold the C button, and aim.
[62:31.87]Release the C button to fire a web shot.
[62:38.68]What the fuck?
[62:39.80]That's so cool.
[62:40.48]Hold on, I gotta get him.
[62:41.34]Alright, I'm gonna die if I don't.
[62:48.89]Did I get him?
[62:49.73]He dodged it.
[62:50.87]Oh, I can't.
[62:51.21]Alright, I'm gonna have to try that on somebody else.
[62:55.23]It really makes you feel like a spider.
[62:57.15]Yes, it does.
[62:57.61]Alright, we good?
[63:07.10]That's good.
[63:07.52]Alright, what am I gonna... Spider-Man PS4.
[63:13.33]Like, THQ had so many cool random games.
[63:18.00]Like, why couldn't they get, like, $500 million in funding?
[63:25.54]We gotta go this way.
[63:33.83]I came from this way?
[63:34.73]The arrow's pointing over here.
[63:36.85]They didn't sell well to the companies?
[63:40.41]Yeah, but I want them to be doing well, so it should be doing well!
[63:44.91]Right?
[63:47.67]What did that just say?
[63:51.22]What did that just say?
[63:51.80]Something about upgrading health?
[63:57.82]Earwigs eat silverfish.
[63:59.08]I want to be an earwig then.
[64:04.64]I don't know.
[64:04.92]I'm not paying attention.
[64:05.73]Well, pay attention!
[64:07.39]Will this help?
[64:11.65]Will that... Will this help you pay attention?
[64:13.85]I don't want to be... I don't like the way this is.
[64:20.27]Pay attention to me.
[64:28.09]Yeah, see, we're like checking the game out together.
[64:34.14]Give me attention.
[64:34.86]Give me attention.
[64:37.00]Fuck.
[64:40.52]No!
[64:41.06]Is this what it's like?
[64:57.67]Get out of the way!
[64:58.28]Holy shit, he just stabbed me.
[65:01.60]I'm gonna die.
[65:03.80]Why are they on the same team?
[65:05.20]Why am I going for the... Why would I go for the fucking cricket?
[65:12.97]Fuck!
[65:15.03]Why does this motherfucker get boxing gloves?
[65:20.28]Back up.
[65:43.54]Ooh!
[65:44.36]Two hits.
[65:44.78]Alright, just get two.
[65:51.24]Just get two.
[65:51.60]Don't get greedy.
[65:52.20]There's no reason to be greedy.
[66:06.69]There it is.
[66:07.57]Nice.
[66:09.05]Wait, QTEs are in this game.
[66:14.78]Alright, what?
[66:28.62]You're delayed?
[66:29.20]Wait, I think I play as the scorpion.
[66:31.52]Huge delay.
[66:32.40]I'm playing as the scorpion now.
[66:38.90]Oh fuck, sorry.
[66:42.82]I play as the scorpion now.
[66:46.63]It is a massive delay.
[66:47.59]I didn't realize it.
[66:48.19]I had to switch it back.
[66:49.53]Holy shit, okay.
[66:51.49]Do I get like a stab?
[66:56.44]That's cool.
[66:56.90]What about the side?
[66:57.60]What about sideways?
[66:59.76]No, I only have one move.
[67:02.12]Stab and claw.
[67:04.74]It's still delayed.
[67:05.46]It's still desynced?
[67:08.71]What the fuck?
[67:11.05]Alright, what's happening for, like, ready?
[67:16.26]Does a bip happen first or after?
[67:17.91]Ready?
[67:18.11]Bop!
[67:23.47]It's fine.
[67:23.93]There's one guy.
[67:24.57]Oh, so there's liars in here.
[67:28.65]Okay.
[67:32.05]Find a way out of the underground.
[67:33.21]Alright, you got it.
[67:33.71]Stop pretending that's a bad test.
[67:42.95]Press the A button to strike with your pincers.
[67:45.59]Strain together.
[67:46.29]You'd be on the screen for more than a second, man.
[67:47.91]Ooh, the Scorpion is a three-hit combo.
[67:53.77]One, two, three.
[67:56.45]One, two, three, four.
[67:59.29]Four-hit combo.
[68:00.31]Are you fucking fogging serious?
[68:04.49]Trying to fucking relate to you guys.
[68:13.39]Swing down for a stab.
[68:23.79]I fucking hate wolf spiders.
[68:26.27]I seriously do.
[68:43.31]You can block!
[68:44.11]You can block as a scorpion.
[68:52.31]Where?
[68:54.25]Oh, he's HUGE!
[68:55.51]I fucking hate- I don't like this.
[68:58.66]Don't hurt me!
[69:19.61]Right in his fucking head.
[69:20.85]Right in his fucking skull.
[69:21.99]Is he alive?
[69:22.33]No?
[69:22.71]Okay.
[69:31.99]They don't sound like that!
[69:38.01]Why do they have to sound like that?
[69:41.23]Is it a one-hit kill?
[69:41.95]No, it's not.
[69:42.87]C. What does C do?
[69:45.99]C?
[69:49.83]Oh, it's an intimidation.
[69:53.97]I have a taunt as the scorpion.
[70:02.34]Well, you don't fucking fear me.
[70:04.06]Oh man, I'm all talked.
[70:17.09]Tail whip.
[70:19.43]deal with.
[70:21.18]Nice.
[70:21.42]Alright, scorpions are, I think, a little cooler, but you can't jump and just float.
[70:25.82]Scorpions are the most feared insect.
[70:31.62]Uh, no, that's the praying mantis.
[70:36.04]Dash?
[70:38.12]Holy shit, that's terrifying.
[70:46.91]Rangmanta sucks.
[70:49.33]Talking about pound for pound.
[70:51.15]The... Pound for pound, the most deadly and the most powerful pound for pound, inch by inch species on Earth.
[71:04.67]They're like... Hold on, I don't want to fix my hair.
[71:10.53]I just did anyways.
[71:13.48]They can't even hurt people.
[71:15.85]Praying Mantis is, alright, I'll give you this.
[71:18.41]Frog is fucking way stronger.
[71:20.41]Frog, like, eats Praying Mantis.
[71:22.39]Frog, okay.
[71:23.81]Frog eats Praying Mantis.
[71:26.01]Alright, Tiger eat Frog.
[71:28.03]Fine, I'll give you that.
[71:28.86]Frog eat Praying Mantis.
[71:30.86]Praying Mantis eat Scorpion.
[71:32.22]Scorpion eat Spider.
[71:33.34]Spider eat Mosquito.
[71:35.18]Mosquito eat you.
[71:38.26]It's a cycle of life, guys.
[71:46.62]How do I move?
[71:56.68]It's very dark.
[71:58.25]Where am I going?
[71:59.27]It wants me to go this way, but how do I get over there?
[72:05.93]Oh, alright.
[72:10.75]What do we eat?
[72:12.73]Fruits and vegetables.
[72:14.15]And sometimes hamburgers.
[72:18.03]And then vegetables eat water.
[72:20.49]And dirt.
[72:25.96]Ass.
[72:26.30]What?
[72:31.60]Uh-oh.
[72:33.24]I thought that was a big, like, white spider or something.
[72:36.62]And I was about to fucking shit my pants.
[72:39.44]That was a person's body.
[72:40.46]That's a dead... That's a body.
[72:41.78]That's a hand.
[72:42.68]That's kind of fucked up.
[72:48.70]Got greedy.
[72:51.69]Well, it's doing the thing that they do on walls.
[72:53.61]I feel like they're above me right now, like in real life.
[73:04.76]Ooh, that's a double.
[73:22.23]Don't look behind.
[73:26.13]It's when they go up.
[73:26.99]I feel like when they go away from the screen and out off of, like, stage left and stage right, that they're going to be on my walls.
[73:34.31]You know, they come up from here and then all of a sudden there's one right there.
[73:38.57]Ugh.
[73:38.69]There's one under your neck.
[73:42.52]Is there?
[73:45.14]Dude, what the fuck?
[73:46.88]Spider.
[73:47.46]Ooh.
[73:48.02]Dude.
[73:50.82]Grub?
[73:52.24]What the hell was that?
[73:54.92]Oh shit!
[73:56.60]Was that a silverfish?
[73:57.72]Am I dead?
[73:59.46]Was that a silverfish?
[74:02.42]He was just existing.
[74:04.12]I told you I wanted to be in one- oh.
[74:07.18]That's too bad.
[74:07.96]That's too bad.
[74:13.75]What the hell is- Am I in like a person's rib cage?
[74:23.46]Holy shit, there's a dead body down here.
[74:26.56]Oh!
[74:26.94]It's me!
[74:28.00]It's me from the past!
[74:37.37]Fuck.
[74:41.45]Fuck!
[74:41.77]He's... He can go through my block.
[74:49.73]When an enemy is weak enough, grab it with C!
[74:53.98]Oh!
[74:56.68]Ooh, that was right in his head.
[74:59.24]That was directly in his head.
[75:01.96]Enter the correct gestures with the Wiimote and nunchuck when prompted to end the battle with a deadly finishing move.
[75:08.41]You can also perform a finishing move for gaining a small amount of health.
[75:20.72]Oh!
[75:25.03]Whoa.
[75:26.19]So we found out who wins.
[75:29.41]You gave him the stone cold stunner.
[75:34.41]Oh.
[75:36.00]That stunner to Shane McMahon, though, in like 2000.
[75:38.04]Oh, it's the best stunner ever.
[75:40.84]Best stunner ever.
[75:42.52]Stunner to Shane.
[75:44.10]You know what I'm talking about.
[75:46.18]Un-fucking-believable.
[75:47.12]It's like the most fluid, most unbelievable thing I've ever seen in my life.
[75:52.88]And he, like, spits the water.
[75:54.20]It's like, ba-boom!
[75:55.38]And it's like he springboarded up.
[75:56.92]Oh, Shane McMahon did the best stunts.
[75:59.52]That was in Stone Cold Steve Austin's book, by the way.
[76:02.25]He said Shane McMahon was the one that did the best stunts.
[76:08.19]Show it.
[76:10.43]Fine.
[76:16.14]We'll go over it.
[76:22.32]Is this the one?
[76:26.18]nope somebody I'm trying to find it it's like the best stun ever I'm gonna write best stun somebody got it no it's not no no no not shane mcmahon didn't have white hair this is the one this is the best let's go over this
[76:53.30]Right now.
[76:53.62]Whatever.
[76:54.36]We'll put this on pause.
[76:55.54]It's all good.
[76:56.20]This game's fucking fun.
[76:56.90]We're gonna keep playing.
[76:57.48]Don't worry.
[77:01.44]God, it just... It's so satisfying when it's just like... I thought he was pretending.
[77:08.96]What?
[77:10.65]Why would I ever pretend on something so important?
[77:14.19]This man is capable of anything.
[77:16.41]Steve Blackman is the one who ran over Stone Cold Steve Austin.
[77:25.97]Oh, that wasn't even any good.
[77:27.23]Uh-oh, wait a minute.
[77:28.71]Look at that.
[77:32.43]What?
[77:32.75]Oh.
[77:32.87]At a juice bar.
[77:36.59]Oh.
[77:47.86]That was the best one ever.
[77:57.13]Here it is.
[77:57.65]It's the second one.
[77:58.79]No, no, no, no, no.
[78:02.72]Oh, it's this one.
[78:03.32]It's the second one.
[78:04.02]This one right here.
[78:28.03]and the lead back you can tell look at this he wasn't ready for it stop stop what's the stone called steve uh okay see his knees are supposed to be hitting the ground at the same time and they are not steve uh what's this guy's name steve
[78:50.08]Wasn't correct.
[78:50.84]Check out the knee placement and the spring.
[78:53.39]Look at the knee placement here.
[78:54.69]You've got an incredible fucking, incredible, absolute, symmetrical, 90 degree knee angle.
[79:01.65]Boom!
[79:02.73]Then he pushes his hands up, springboards up.
[79:04.61]I know this shit.
[79:05.45]Trust me, it's the best done ever.
[79:09.83]Check it out again.
[79:11.16]Another good exhibit here.
[79:12.38]Check the knees.
[79:13.78]Bingo, right there.
[79:15.52]Wham!
[79:16.42]Launches himself up.
[79:17.22]This is at 0.25% speed.
[79:29.79]Now that just reminded me of one time.
[79:31.98]So back in the day, some of you may have heard this story.
[79:34.84]I might be telling it again, but we're going to show it.
[79:37.76]Me and MLC Stealth were in a Skype call, I believe.
[79:41.55]We were just talking.
[79:42.19]We were hanging out.
[79:42.67]We used to do Skype calls all the time.
[79:44.99]And we would watch wrestling clips.
[79:47.64]and at the time I had a machinima partner manager somebody that was a machinima partner person that you know if you have had a problem with youtube hit me up uh let me like the contacts and like that right so the way that skype was worked out it was you know had the names of whoever was somebody that you were you know you had their username and then the little chat window well I accidentally uh linked to my machinima partner manager
[80:13.32]Instead of MLC Stealth, Stone Cold stuns the entire McMahon family.
[80:18.20]By the way, I didn't speak to this person for probably seven or eight months before I sent them this link.
[80:23.18]And it was kind of weird, but whatever.
[80:27.49]I was like, oh, sorry, I just said delete.
[80:35.45]Imagine getting this shit from like one of your partners you haven't heard from in like a fucking year.
[80:49.40]So you got a busy night ahead of you?
[80:52.34]Thank you.
[80:54.30]Hey.
[80:58.46]Don't leave.
[81:00.18]I wanted to show you something.
[81:03.29]That right there.
[81:15.86]I'm a chairman of the WWE!
[81:17.00]Well, Mitch certainly felt it.
[81:18.30]You know what?
[81:18.60]He should open up a can of whole lads.
[81:23.24]He stuns the entire family.
[81:24.04]Oh, there he is.
[81:26.78]He's going to get a springboard again.
[81:27.71]Hey, you might have heard that one.
[81:45.55]The best one, the best one's coming up.
[81:52.11]When he stuns, when he stuns, he stuns them all.
[81:58.15]Maybe you don't understand that I'm Stephanie McMahon.
[82:06.72]No, I do understand.
[82:07.77]I was just going to conduct an interview and ask you a few questions.
[82:11.61]You look lovely tonight.
[82:13.95]What fragrance are you wearing?
[82:21.57]Do you have an answer?
[82:22.71]It's perfume.
[82:27.04]He's going to just stutter.
[82:30.12]I get it.
[82:33.38]Imagine being in minute number three.
[82:35.56]Imagine being in minute number three as the machinima partner manager.
[82:42.13]Alright, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[82:45.47]Hey, man, I'm out here running through your dad and your brother.
[82:48.03]Couple of stunners.
[82:48.81]Booyah!
[82:51.85]It's like three and a half, four minutes of this.
[82:56.76]Maybe you'd like to give old Stone Cold a kiss.
[83:05.49]That was bang!
[83:08.39]Where'd it go?
[83:08.99]Where'd it go?
[83:09.37]Where'd it go?
[83:12.95]What happened to my stream?
[83:13.99]Where's my fucking stream?
[83:17.31]Oh, there it is.
[83:35.97]Oh, that was a good fall.
[83:40.61]That was a good trap fall.
[83:43.54]See the symmetry.
[83:47.52]By the way, it's not over.
[84:00.67]All right, just wait.
[84:02.35]This one is fucking, look at this, right?
[84:10.93]By the way, this like kills you, apparently.
[84:18.02]When you get stunned.
[84:19.10]Oh man, I'm unconscious for like 12 straight minutes.
[84:23.38]If you were unconscious for like 15 straight minutes, like that's bad.
[84:29.99]They're all just like dead.
[84:34.70]Poor little Stephanie is a precious piece of trash.
[84:41.07]Where is it?
[84:43.77]CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, a classy woman, Linda McMahon.
[84:52.16]And I forgot to say, thank you.
[85:08.22]Look at this shit.
[85:10.91]This is like the best.
[85:15.29]Just watch the balls.
[85:18.30]Neither one was prepared either.
[85:22.76]Let's take a look at the symmetry on this one.
[85:55.52]okay so let's just very briefly go over the fact that yes this is the link that I sent
[86:05.17]To my partner manager at the time.
[86:06.67]And I hadn't spoken to him in about a year.
[86:10.51]Why?
[86:10.75]Why are you sending this to me, man?
[86:12.45]What the fuck are you doing?
[86:14.37]Hey, man.
[86:15.19]Check out... Check out Stone Cold Stuns the entire fucking McMahon family.
[86:19.35]What do you think about that?
[86:20.21]Isn't that cool, man?
[86:24.81]God.
[86:25.19]Alright, let's keep going.
[86:33.32]Back to the Scorpion game.
[86:39.19]You're out of business now.
[86:53.50]Yep.
[86:53.74]Plus two.
[87:00.16]Thanks for sharing, Dad.
[87:01.08]You're welcome, son.
[87:10.95]Did somebody give enough of 50 fucking dollars?
[87:18.87]Is that actually me though?
[87:25.74]Fuck, it is.
[87:28.74]Scorpions eat these!
[87:31.42]Why do scorpions eat these?
[87:33.28]I thought scorpions ate, like, fucking human meat.
[87:36.37]From all the scary stories and shit, they eat, like, fucking birds and humans and stuff, don't they?
[87:41.43]And, like, animals.
[87:44.00]Phylactery Lich, another 50 fucking dollars.
[87:47.13]Holy shit, wrestling was fucking crazy.
[87:49.47]Show the Vince walk.
[87:52.91]The Vince walk is just one step away from the thing that I do.
[87:58.05]Except the thing that I do is, if you want to know some heavy lore here, that is actually Clayman from the Neverhood.
[88:08.36]That walk is Clayman from the Neverhood.
[88:11.46]That's where it comes from.
[88:12.34]That's what I'm imitating.
[88:12.98]There you go.
[88:19.69]But thanks for the fucking 5,000 bits, dude.
[88:22.65]That's a lot of money.
[88:26.00]You keep giving huge money.
[88:28.48]Show the walk.
[88:30.06]Update the wiki.
[88:31.48]Someone will get it.
[88:33.42]Someone will get that.
[88:36.10]I got my hands full.
[88:37.96]I'd say shoot, okay?
[88:41.39]What the fuck?
[88:42.69]I can't.
[88:49.04]Is there another tarantula?
[88:56.64]That was terrifying.
[89:01.93]Wait, that was this stream?
[89:03.15]Yeah.
[89:03.75]It was like an hour ago.
[89:04.59]Alright, let's go.
[89:09.95]He dodged it.
[89:10.59]Eh, I still got him.
[89:16.49]What are you, Ghiazio, Ghiazio, Ghiazio, Ghiazio, Ghiazio, Ghiazio.
[89:20.68]Get it.
[89:25.92]Fuck.
[89:26.41]Come on.
[89:28.75]Get it.
[89:37.32]Oh, that's the thumbnail.
[89:38.42]Oh.
[90:03.99]Fuck.
[90:06.13]Don't worry, it'll be updated in like two minutes.
[90:12.16]Shit.
[90:27.27]Why does this keep happening?
[90:28.21]Because I keep opening up the YouTube videos in the middle of these streams.
[90:33.70]This is a scary music.
[90:42.38]This is a real reaction, so I'm not like putting this on for the camera.
[90:45.00]Of course I am.
[90:45.81]Of course I am.
[90:47.59]But you know, but that actually, when they're in their webs and shit.
[90:57.67]Three at a time.
[91:05.90]Block, block, block, block, block, block, block.
[91:17.42]Fuck.
[91:18.79]Fuck!
[91:20.37]Oh, you dick!
[91:22.91]Where'd he go?
[91:25.41]Oh shit, he's just ricocheting.
[91:29.15]Please, Germo, please!
[91:31.87]What do you want?! !
[91:36.09]What?
[91:36.39]Please!
[91:36.95]Please!
[91:37.51]Please!
[91:38.33]Please!
[91:39.11]Please!
[91:39.87]Please!
[91:40.31]What the f- AHHHHH!
[92:04.85]I don't like this thing.
[92:06.23]What the fuck is this?
[92:11.93]Why is this possible?
[92:15.35]What the fuck?
[92:16.69]Hold on a second.
[92:18.07]This is important.
[92:18.84]What the fuck is this?
[92:23.36]Have we gone too far?
[92:24.62]Probably.
[92:25.06]Yeah, I mean, how did you do this?
[92:31.02]Seriously, how did you do this?
[92:46.49]Not that.
[92:47.03]This is OBS.
[93:11.56]No, I... I want to...
[93:20.83]Reddit streamer.
[93:22.73]That's a Reddit video.
[93:25.03]Hold on.
[93:25.57]We got a link to just the actual video.
[93:30.46]How do I just get to that, right?
[93:32.78]Isn't there a way I can do that?
[93:38.42]It has audio.
[93:39.56]I know.
[93:40.16]I'll get this.
[93:41.76]No, that's how Reddit works.
[93:43.04]I have to actually just physically go to the page.
[93:47.79]Hold on.
[93:57.79]Oh, hold on, I gotta open up, I can't, I forgot, I can't use... I forgot, I can't use Mozilla.
[94:06.33]Ah, fuck, I gotta turn the microwave off.
[94:09.72]This is important, though.
[94:14.30]Hold on.
[94:18.44]Okay, now let me get this over here.
[94:20.65]There's audio, too, apparently.
[94:34.04]Why is the Reddit player so bad?
[94:35.54]This is like the worst thing ever.
[94:37.30]This is like the worst thing ever.
[94:52.97]Why can't I fucking capture this?
[94:57.11]What the fuck is going on here?
[95:06.65]I can't even capture the fucking window.
[95:10.75]Somebody got it?
[95:12.43]There we go.
[95:13.49]Thank you.
[95:15.07]Thank you.
[95:21.30]This stuff just doesn't even fucking work either.
[95:23.30]I have never been a quitter.
[95:27.84]I fucking hate this.
[95:44.41]Why?
[95:44.71]Alright, something's wrong with my OBS.
[95:46.39]I can't, like, pull this in.
[95:47.33]I'm just gonna have to do it like this.
[95:56.06]It's, like, fucked up.
[96:01.02]You're a quitter.
[96:01.98]I mean, I'm just at the mercy of trying to get my window to capture, and I can't.
[96:05.64]It won't capture.
[96:09.98]Okay, there we go.
[96:13.30]So you took the picture of me.
[96:18.27]That's the picture.
[96:19.17]I have never been a quitter.
[96:22.55]To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
[96:30.02]But as president, I must put the interests of America first.
[96:37.22]America needs a full-time president and a full-time Congress.
[96:43.72]particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad, to continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the President and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home.
[97:13.87]Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
[97:20.66]Vice President Ford will be sworn in as president at that hour in this office.
[97:52.87]Okay.
[97:54.11]Um... Okay.
[98:02.00]What the fuck is all- What is this?
[98:04.08]Is it- What?!
[98:18.96]What technology is this?! !
[98:21.87]what technology is this this is it this is too much this is too much technology we got to go back to writing on paper and we got to go back to sending mail in the mail
[99:02.76]I got a feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night, that tonight's gonna be a good night, that tonight's
[99:53.52]Okay, that was interesting That was interesting um
[100:08.90]Fuck we're doomed.
[100:11.01]As like a whole society.
[100:12.97]Aren't we?
[100:15.08]Shit.
[100:20.94]Like, holy shit.
[100:23.94]You can have a picture and say anything you want, and it can look kind of real.
[100:28.23]What happens in five years when it looks very real?
[100:31.31]And it's like, you can tell anybody anything.
[100:33.95]You can make anyone say anything.
[100:34.89]You can make any picture.
[100:36.47]The picture of me with my girlfriend at, like, Disneyland.
[100:39.75]Can't be used for me to say anything you want.
[100:46.12]Read the top comment on German resigned.
[100:59.22]Why?
[100:59.42]100% if Jerma saw this, he would go on a five-minute rant about how fucking scary technology is today.
[101:07.04]Because you can do shit like this.
[101:08.04]And he would be right.
[101:08.68]This is terrifying.
[101:10.60]Yeah.
[101:11.06]I think anybody that sees themselves in a photo they took three or four plus years ago doing a resigning President Nixon presidency speech, it's a little unnerving, I think.
[101:28.05]With the future of our children.
[101:32.57]He's doing- Alright, I'm not doing it anymore.
[101:34.27]I'm not doing it.
[101:34.91]Okay.
[101:45.35]We're playing a fun game over here, don't you think?
[101:47.19]Hold on, let me switch over my audio.
[101:55.75]To the speech.
[101:56.41]I already did the speech.
[102:01.23]Resign or riot?
[102:04.29]Resign?
[102:05.39]Hey, dude, fucking resign already.
[102:07.62]Or riot.
[102:10.80]Jesus.
[102:11.98]Okay, let's go.
[102:17.40]I wonder, what other creatures do you get to play as?
[102:20.11]Do those things hatch?
[102:25.11]I hope not.
[102:33.63]Stop being a streamer.
[102:35.79]I'm gonna keep streaming!
[102:38.83]Four times a week!
[102:46.57]How do I get up?
[102:47.17]I'm supposed to go up.
[102:51.71]Up this thing?
[102:52.21]I guess I could go this way?
[102:56.36]Oh, wait a minute, hold on.
[103:00.48]No, I can't go up and around.
[103:03.63]This is the wrong way.
[103:05.55]Wrong way.
[103:08.53]And I am resigning the presidency of the United States of America.
[103:14.89]And I will- It's just so fucked up.
[103:17.25]The eyes like- Like they go fucking all over the place.
[103:20.21]Here we go.
[103:31.89]Oh, they don't do that, do they?
[103:38.26]Is that a black widow?
[103:41.86]That's a black widow, isn't it?
[103:43.80]Or it's a faux widow.
[103:46.88]How do I save him?
[103:47.56]I can't save him!
[103:48.70]How am I supposed to save him?
[103:50.66]I can't.
[103:51.22]He's just... He's getting eaten.
[103:53.24]I can't help him.
[104:00.93]Holy shit, they can attack.
[104:08.63]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[104:16.02]Block, block, block, block, block.
[104:18.22]Oh, they go through the block?
[104:19.10]Are you kidding me?
[104:28.17]Get out of here.
[104:28.85]Get rid of that shit.
[104:32.05]Oh!
[104:33.50]Oh, he dodged!
[104:59.93]There it is.
[105:00.87]There it is.
[105:01.37]Fuck, I was just walking by!
[105:07.73]I was just walking by.
[105:12.89]I'm so useless.
[105:15.64]We go up?
[105:16.42]In?
[105:27.10]The wasps.
[105:27.94]The worst.
[105:32.13]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till he lands.
[105:33.83]Wait till he lands, okay.
[105:36.15]Recycling, uh, content that people really liked.
[105:38.57]Okay, wait till he- here he comes, here he comes.
[105:48.71]Ooh, up in smoke.
[105:51.42]Yeah, you know the one.
[105:54.72]Somebody said it looks like I'm cut off.
[105:56.72]No, I'm just bad at streaming.
[106:00.00]I learned how to stream like four to five years ago and I learned one way to do it and I have not changed it ever since.
[106:06.71]I only know one way to stream and it's like 2013 way to stream.
[106:11.93]I've not made any progress.
[106:14.56]In regards to like quality.
[106:15.80]It's just there.
[106:17.32]Just from like 2014.
[106:29.41]It shows, King.
[106:34.91]He's a classic streamer.
[106:41.74]1080's still fine.
[106:43.66]Uh-oh, Scorpion versus Scorpion.
[106:49.89]What kind of Scorpion is that?
[106:50.83]What kind of Scorpion am I?
[106:56.75]Oh, shit.
[106:58.07]Mirror match.
[107:02.65]Are we, like, emperor scorpions?
[107:05.41]I think we are.
[107:05.89]Ooh, shit, I got it.
[107:07.94]Tail whip.
[107:13.24]Tail whip.
[107:24.64]Come on, get... Yes!
[107:39.49]Ooh, how do I kill one of... Nice.
[107:45.62]Got it.
[107:48.86]Do I eat... Do I... We... They eat each other?
[107:50.64]Dig.
[107:56.02]You can now uncover passages and hollows in certain places.
[107:59.39]I can dig.
[108:03.99]Why's it not working?
[108:15.78]At the crummy walls.
[108:17.08]Yeah, okay.
[108:17.72]Oh.
[108:20.25]I didn't know that they... That was just me just trying to hang out under the rock.
[108:23.49]Why does it always have to be me?
[108:27.89]Oh, right, because I said that's the kind of animal I was.
[108:30.59]What kind of animal would I actually be, guys?
[108:32.14]What do you think?
[108:35.48]If you were to say... What kind of animal or bug?
[108:39.58]A rat?
[108:39.90]That's an easy answer, though.
[108:46.32]A penis.
[108:56.23]Got any more?
[109:05.59]Comedy 100.
[109:11.02]Holy shit, I just exploded his head.
[109:13.42]Was that his head that flew behind me?
[109:17.42]I just like chopped his head off.
[109:19.08]It was like an axe.
[109:25.79]I wonder if we see that... ...snake again.
[109:29.61]Ah, something here.
[109:33.35]You'd be a hyena or a squirrel.
[109:36.59]Eh.
[109:38.94]I can see the hyena part.
[109:39.96]Yeah, that makes sense.
[109:44.70]A weasel.
[109:46.74]But I'd be a cool weasel, though.
[109:48.42]Right?
[109:52.68]I wanna be like an animal weasel.
[109:54.44]Not like a Disney cartoon weasel.
[109:58.46]You know what I mean?
[110:06.85]Oh, now we're getting dark.
[110:18.47]Look at all these dead bugs.
[110:23.74]Oh, it's going to be a frog, isn't it?
[110:25.80]It's going to be a frog, isn't it?
[110:28.10]It's going to be a frog.
[110:31.94]I told you.
[110:32.78]The predator of all... It's going to be frog, then scorpion.
[110:38.76]This is a big area.
[110:39.58]Full health.
[110:54.19]Am I digging?
[110:54.81]It looked like I could- I told you it was gonna be a- it's a lizard.
[111:08.68]Holy shit.
[111:15.92]What kind of lizard is this?
[111:18.72]Oh, man.
[111:25.15]Escape from the Gila monster.
[111:27.37]Oh, wow.
[111:28.05]It's like a... It's like a monitor lizard.
[111:33.15]How do I... Where do I just get out?
[111:34.37]Attack him?
[111:40.09]Where do I go?
[111:40.53]How do I get out?
[111:44.49]Stab him in the... Stab him in the big fatty... Oh, no.
[111:47.44]Do not do that.
[111:48.14]Run away.
[111:50.38]Just get the hell out of here.
[111:53.00]Up there?
[111:56.96]Cut the tail, cut the tail.
[111:59.03]I'm just trying to get the fuck out of here.
[112:03.81]CLIMB IT!
[112:05.47]CLIMB!
[112:11.94]I think he- he does- he lost me.
[112:23.00]DIG!
[112:26.93]Alright, dig.
[112:30.10]Do I dig?
[112:31.44]Dig!
[112:35.46]Dig!
[112:38.66]Oh, I get it!
[112:39.16]I know what he wants me to do.
[112:40.92]He's gonna way too much.
[112:41.66]He's gonna way, way too much.
[112:42.66]I get it.
[112:44.89]He's gonna crash through this.
[113:00.59]All right, one more.
[113:01.25]Okay, get it.
[113:15.92]Fuck, that hurt.
[113:17.66]It may be better to flee than, I know what I'm doing.
[113:44.59]How much is left?
[113:45.93]Oh, fuck!
[113:48.73]There's another one.
[113:51.76]Where is it?
[114:14.40]This guy sucks.
[114:15.82]SHUT UP!
[114:21.72]I just did an Adam Sandler at them.
[114:24.24]Shut up!
[114:26.18]Whatever.
[114:26.60]He's almost got fucking Academy Award and all you guys hated him.
[114:39.45]It's right here.
[114:40.73]Fine, fine, fine, fine.
[114:41.93]It's literally right here.
[114:42.77]Literally.
[114:44.49]It's literally here.
[114:45.79]Okay?
[114:53.25]Okay.
[114:53.84]Dig out all the junk.
[114:58.80]You have to resign now.
[115:00.02]I'm not resigning anything.
[115:01.46]Alright, go.
[115:10.66]I know what I have to do.
[115:11.38]I know he's gonna get... We're gonna watch him get eaten again.
[115:18.65]I really like this concept though, where the bosses are just like a snake, a lizard.
[115:25.33]Probably gonna be like a frog.
[115:27.78]This is probably gonna be a frog, right?
[115:29.62]It has to be.
[115:34.18]Alright, let's go, okay?
[115:45.59]What the fuck was that?
[116:01.19]Why is this not working?
[116:08.12]Okay, this... Hello?
[116:12.00]Excuse me?
[116:13.32]What the fuck are you doing?
[116:26.60]You guys are watching in real time.
[116:29.78]You're watching in real time me shake this fucking thing.
[116:46.05]Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.
[117:02.48]I can't wait for Resident Evil 4 Wii.
[117:05.06]Me either, dude.
[117:07.00]You're gonna see this.
[117:14.57]The bug game's too hard.
[117:15.65]No, it's just like... Evidence on the screen.
[117:31.52]It's not Z. Z blocks.
[117:33.36]Do you understand?
[117:46.67]You gotta be like... Okay, I get it.
[117:52.53]MonkaS, he's losing it.
[117:53.72]Oh, sorry.
[117:55.34]Okay, yes.
[117:56.86]Sorry about that.
[118:01.35]When are you gonna play Resident Evil 3?
[118:03.21]Well, um, people could vote on Resident Evil 3.
[118:06.13]And they didn't pick it, as they said.
[118:07.55]Hey, actually, we got a lot of people here right now.
[118:09.45]I've heard.
[118:09.89]Remember, I'm a huge fan of Resident Evil 2.
[118:12.06]Huge fan.
[118:14.28]I heard that Resident Evil 3 is like half the length of Resident Evil 2.
[118:18.88]And it's not very good.
[118:20.38]Except I'm just telling what I heard.
[118:24.47]Alright, I'm not gonna fuck this up.
[118:34.09]Here we go.
[118:38.33]Got it.
[118:39.75]Alright, alright.
[118:56.21]Why is it working this time?
[118:57.11]Am I stupid or something?
[118:58.37]Fuck.
[118:59.93]Wait till next time.
[119:02.73]What am I... I don't understand what I'm doing different.
[119:17.26]How'd I stop digging?
[119:27.71]There's one more here.
[119:32.63]I thought I could... He just double tapped me.
[119:34.97]Fine.
[119:35.31]Fuck you.
[119:40.63]This is it?
[119:44.88]Oh, he almost got me.
[119:46.72]Nice work.
[119:51.44]Nice work, you.
[119:52.94]Hey.
[119:53.60]Nice work, you.
[119:56.88]Thanks.
[120:00.17]This is a 10-minute game.
[120:01.87]Oh, yeah, but, so, um... Going back to the spider now.
[120:05.61]So, Resident Evil 3 is not that great, huh?
[120:15.09]I'm still gonna play it, though.
[120:16.13]I mean, what, am I not gonna play it?
[120:17.99]Remember, I can jump now.
[120:28.86]When did we find a human?
[120:41.70]What the hell is this?
[120:42.38]This is like a patch.
[120:47.34]A briar patch.
[120:48.16]Uh-oh.
[120:51.76]A regular lizard.
[120:53.82]Bees!
[120:56.06]Oh my god!
[120:59.64]What are those?
[121:02.12]Mites?
[121:04.52]Holy shit, they just disintegrated that lizard.
[121:07.18]Try to avoid the mites.
[121:18.55]What do I do?
[121:18.93]Get off me!
[121:29.70]I could just, like, feel those on me.
[121:39.68]Can I jump over them?
[121:49.06]This is kind of a scary game.
[122:00.34]Kinda.
[122:01.16]Wait.
[122:01.62]Watch it.
[122:04.77]Do they have a pattern?
[122:06.99]Which is... Avoid them?
[122:08.81]Jump over them?
[122:12.93]I think I have to just... I have to go through them?
[122:15.71]Underneath them?
[122:16.85]Can I make it if I run now?
[122:18.03]Nope.
[122:23.15]I think you just have to get through them.
[122:25.41]They'll just suck your blood.
[122:26.28]Okay, they're like a... They're like a laser.
[122:36.45]You just have to avoid it.
[122:51.50]Irma has mites.
[122:53.42]It's the very opposite of a laser.
[122:54.88]No, I'm talking about like in a game where it's just like... You have to go through, you have to run through before you get hit by the laser.
[123:06.59]Figured maybe you could knock him down.
[123:20.98]They're running away.
[123:22.10]Oh, the mites.
[123:22.76]The mites are going after me.
[123:32.05]Fuck.
[123:32.29]I got too many.
[123:33.25]There's too many around me.
[123:35.51]I gotta run away.
[123:44.16]Duh.
[123:52.97]One more?
[123:55.39]Why's my stream 720p?
[123:56.08]Um, there's a few reasons for that.
[123:59.76]Uh, 1080p actually, uh, in my opinion, this is my opinion, is that I don't think it's worth streaming.
[124:07.42]Because it takes a lot more bandwidth, it takes a lot more resources, and 1080p doesn't really even look any good until about 8,000 to 10,000k up.
[124:16.97]So Twitch really only allows 6,000 up to pretty much anybody to stream to the platform.
[124:23.90]So a 1080p stream at 6,000 up, I mean, you're talking about a 1080 footage really needs like 10,000 up.
[124:31.78]Like, look, good.
[124:32.90]At least 8 to 10.
[124:33.48]That's why I don't do it.
[124:40.65]now you can do like eight like some people do 900p like 870 880 I could do that but I got a 1080 maybe in the future we'll see we'll see where's this other spider that's apparently alive just talking yeah I'm talking bit rate like 4 000 up like different like a 6 000 bit rate where does this want me to go
[125:11.38]What the fuck just happened?
[125:14.13]Did I just, like, skip a major part of the level?
[125:18.15]Oh, it's these things.
[125:19.01]It's the other spider I don't like.
[125:20.33]The other, like, weird spiders.
[125:22.61]They're black widows.
[125:24.55]Yep, I hate these.
[125:27.53]Look, I know it's cool.
[125:28.59]I know, like, yeah, you got a tattoo of a black widow.
[125:30.68]I know, like, yes, but... No, I don't like them.
[125:51.42]I'm gonna die.
[125:58.69]Find the Widow's Cathedral.
[126:01.81]Hold the B button to build up your venom, and then swing the Wiimote down to deliver a venom pounce.
[126:07.66]It's a dot.
[126:10.08]Whoa!
[126:12.26]Okay, that's fucking awesome.
[126:16.00]That's so cool.
[126:16.94]Alright, let me give him these grubs.
[126:19.72]It's the cathedral.
[126:21.36]We gotta go find the cathedral.
[126:25.58]They have organized religion.
[126:27.24]Alright, any... There's another grub over here.
[126:31.62]Okay, this way.
[126:42.35]And then... Jerma has a McChicken tattoo.
[126:47.37]That would be a pretty cool one.
[126:50.80]I'm talking, like, in the wrapper.
[126:52.46]Like, the solid wrapper wrapped McChicken sandwich.
[126:58.90]That sounds pretty good.
[126:59.59]That would be cool.
[127:10.53]Running away?
[127:10.95]I want to try the venom pounce on somebody.
[127:19.99]Remember, do you eat the wrapper?
[127:25.13]Shit, you're bringing back some weird, like, memories when I was younger.
[127:28.80]What was the bubble gum that you chewed the wrapper?
[127:33.54]I remember there was a gum that, like, people chewed with the wrapper on.
[127:39.70]What was it?
[127:43.19]I swear to God, this was a thing.
[127:46.17]It was like a... I think I was lied to when I was a kid.
[127:52.85]It was like, oh yeah, you eat it with the wrapper on.
[127:54.77]You chew it with the wrapper on.
[127:55.63]And I would chew the gum with the wrapper on this one specific brand for some reason.
[127:59.57]There was a reason for it.
[128:03.33]And I remember it was weird.
[128:04.39]And it was just like, this doesn't feel right.
[128:06.62]I shouldn't be doing it like this.
[128:07.56]But I did it.
[128:07.96]And eventually you take the mushed up wrapper out of your mouth.
[128:15.28]Why did I do that?
[128:16.52]Did anybody else do that?
[128:18.52]Any of you?
[128:19.66]For any reason?
[128:24.20]Starburst.
[128:25.26]No, I'm not talking about unwrap it.
[128:26.58]I'm talking about in the wrapper, it goes in your mouth and you chew it with the wrapper on.
[128:30.85]And like break the wrapper down with your teeth chewing it.
[128:37.23]It was Stride?
[128:37.93]It was, seriously, it was Trident.
[128:40.91]Trident.
[128:41.39]It was Trident.
[128:41.99]It was Trident.
[128:42.68]Was it Trident?
[128:45.32]Maybe it was Trident.
[128:46.92]Oh!
[128:49.10]I did it first, so no, you can't do it.
[128:50.84]Ban everybody that says it.
[128:54.99]Let him fight!
[128:57.96]Alright, I'm gonna- I'm gonna- I'm gonna- I'm gonna poison one of them.
[129:06.88]Oh shit, it's Ornstein, it's not!
[129:18.23]Oh!
[129:20.15]I can do that too, dickhead.
[129:33.80]Oh!
[129:37.39]I missed.
[129:39.45]I missed again.
[129:39.83]Oh, it's okay, he died.
[129:41.67]Because I poisoned him.
[129:50.09]Aim for smog.
[129:52.45]Oh!
[129:53.25]Snake!
[129:55.79]What a fucking callback.
[129:57.88]What a callback, Freecher!
[130:01.30]Nice.
[130:09.36]And then it's when he grabs a snake.
[130:11.84]Like a... I don't know, like a... Like an orangutan grabs a snake, right?
[130:17.12]And then like an eagle gets the orangutan.
[130:19.32]And then... You guys know what I was trying to say.
[130:34.64]Do the walk?
[130:35.20]All right.
[130:46.96]That's a Family Guy joke?
[130:49.92]Look, okay, when Family Guy has, like, 28 seasons of show, and the whole point of Family Guy is they come up with, like, 600 random references an episode.
[131:02.33]You're talking about 600 times 30 episodes a season.
[131:08.18]So, 30 times 28...
[131:11.74]There's like, there's like 25 million.
[131:14.68]There's like, there's probably like 55,000 family guy references over the years.
[131:23.72]Oh, wait, we got, we got a fog window here.
[131:34.67]Got it.
[131:36.01]Freeze him.
[131:36.29]Nice.
[131:38.19]Nice.
[131:42.33]Alright, back it up.
[131:43.29]Again, poison.
[131:48.12]Nice.
[131:49.24]This one was fucking pretty good.
[131:51.16]That was an instant kill.
[131:53.15]Eat the shoe.
[131:54.41]You're a little late.
[131:56.39]Oh.
[131:57.75]Never mind.
[132:11.24]When are we going to get another muffled... When are we going to get another muffled $60,000 line from Billy Bob Thornton that just goes... It's coming up soon.
[132:28.22]Why are there so many of these?
[132:41.73]cell phone wait that's that might not be synced up that's not going to be synced up because the delay that's not going to be synced up correctly
[133:10.25]What was it?
[133:10.89]Oh, um, oh.
[133:17.06]Oh, oh, oh!
[133:18.10]I wanted to bring this up on stream!
[133:20.54]So, I've got every service that you call, right?
[133:25.06]Let me get away from the fucking loud beep thing.
[133:28.12]Is there a reason why every time you call any service that's ever existed, the first thing that happens is the, please listen carefully, as our menu options have changed.
[133:39.33]And it's like that for like seven to eight straight years.
[133:42.65]Why do they say that every time?
[133:45.41]Are they so terrified that you're not going to listen to the fucking menu?
[133:50.62]That, oh, okay, the menu options have changed.
[133:53.42]I better listen now.
[133:54.62]That's the tactic, right?
[133:55.44]That's the strategy?
[133:57.97]Because if you call, like for instance, if I were to call like a utility company or like a cable company or something, it says that every fucking time.
[134:06.75]And it's that same exact thing every fucking, the menu doesn't change.
[134:10.15]It's just that every single time.
[134:11.39]It's for old people, right?
[134:17.20]I used to work telecom and we did that.
[134:18.70]So you never changed your options.
[134:23.32]That's a Seinfeld joke.
[134:24.56]Well, guess what?
[134:25.84]Like, Cox Cable has had that since Seinfeld was on the air.
[134:29.60]Do you understand?
[134:30.46]That's my point.
[134:31.34]It still works.
[134:43.53]Back it up.
[134:43.87]Dude, that's an epic Kramer moment.
[134:50.09]Fuck, I thought I could get a big one.
[134:57.85]And I was gonna make a tweet.
[134:59.79]I didn't, though, because, like, I'm lazy and I don't fucking use social media ever because something's wrong with me.
[135:04.43]Uh, I was gonna make a tweet.
[135:05.59]That was a phone.
[135:06.87]And, you know, like the, oh, name a better duo tweets, right?
[135:10.26]It was gonna be, it was gonna be a phone picture that said, please listen carefully.
[135:14.76]And then, like, another phone as our menu options have changed.
[135:18.88]And it's gonna be like, holy shit, that's a pretty good, like, comedy tweet.
[135:23.10]Like, name a, name, name me a better duo, alright?
[135:25.18]Yeah.
[135:28.72]Thank God you didn't do that.
[135:29.74]Why?
[135:33.84]Why?
[135:34.14]What's wrong with that?
[135:34.64]That's, like, funny.
[135:35.62]That's, like, name me.
[135:36.48]Oh, name me.
[135:36.88]I better do it.
[135:37.30]Like, please listen carefully.
[135:38.74]As our menu options have changed.
[135:43.01]That would have been shared around, like, some circles, right?
[135:46.55]That was a new animal.
[135:51.55]That's Boomer here.
[135:52.69]I didn't do it.
[135:53.79]I was just... You guys act like I did this.
[135:56.41]I should do it anyways.
[135:59.39]My aunt would find that funny.
[136:01.55]Yeah, I'm trying to work on some new demographics here.
[136:10.46]You know, we can only ride the, like, scare every new viewer away.
[136:16.26]And have people open the stream and go, I hate this guy.
[136:20.15]Demographic, you know, I gotta branch out to, like, aunts.
[136:28.29]You just split a phrase.
[136:30.03]What?
[136:32.43]Yeah, but it's namely a better duo because everyone knows what that is and everyone's like, gets it.
[136:36.39]You get it.
[136:36.91]Your aunt does.
[136:37.83]Your aunt gets comedy.
[136:39.81]Your aunt is a... understands comedians.
[136:42.77]What just flew by the fucking screen?
[136:45.23]Did I not get that?
[136:53.46]Double strike combos.
[136:55.70]What, I can do a move list?
[137:07.75]Who's that?
[137:12.83]No, no, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna go, like, flood some stream.
[137:17.77]Because you guys are, like, fucking, like, pranking somebody or something.
[137:20.77]Don't do that shit.
[137:26.69]What do you mean?
[137:27.09]It's me.
[137:30.14]What?
[137:42.68]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[137:55.54]Yeah, you can't, you can't be doing, alright, no, you can't, you actually can't be doing that, you can't, like, be streaming, like, movies and shit, and then, like, be naked.
[138:02.88]Uh, so that stream's probably gonna go away pretty quickly.
[138:05.01]Um, yeah, that's probably not, that's probably not gonna last very long.
[138:10.11]Um, it's probably, I would assume that's probably not gonna last a whole lot longer.
[138:14.45]Uh, okay.
[138:25.89]That's all I have to say about that.
[138:27.13]I have nothing else to say besides streaming movies on Twitch is not allowed.
[138:31.73]Unless you use their feature.
[138:34.35]The Twitch watches together feature, if you have it.
[138:39.54]Which that stream does not have.
[138:40.86]Okay, yeah, let's go.
[138:51.20]Ooh, spikes!
[138:52.58]How do I jump?
[138:54.73]Go around?
[138:58.60]I like the crunching noises.
[139:01.66]It's a nice added effect.
[139:05.55]Please listen carefully, as our menu options have changed.
[139:07.91]Name me a better duo.
[139:09.01]Like, oh, I was on the phone the other day and I heard that.
[139:21.94]That's not even realistic.
[139:24.22]Don't all bugs have like a terminal velocity of like 600 million miles per hour or something?
[139:30.55]Like you can't, if you drop like an ant like off a building, it's like just lands normally, right?
[139:36.83]Isn't that, isn't that accurate?
[139:40.91]Like they can't, they literally can't like die if they fall off like a high thing or something.
[139:48.54]No, that's true.
[139:50.33]Tarantulas do not.
[139:51.21]They die from being, oh.
[139:54.38]Oh, yeah.
[139:55.24]Today I learned tarantulas are not ants.
[139:58.16]Right.
[139:59.02]Okay.
[140:00.06]Good to know.
[140:02.48]Only a third of what you said was accurate.
[140:07.38]Do I need to be accurate?
[140:08.46]I got one of those.
[140:21.52]He's so strong.
[140:25.40]He hates links.
[140:26.22]No, I don't hate links.
[140:27.67]I just hate clicking them.
[140:30.59]Alright, hold on.
[140:32.81]This is like the, that part in, I'm not gonna say, I gotta stop saying the word Dark Souls.
[140:42.74]Alright, one of you, one of you is getting poisoned.
[140:45.22]Right now.
[140:53.79]I know!
[140:54.13]You still alive?
[141:01.11]No.
[141:03.02]The Great Hollow, yes.
[141:05.74]Bug's livestream is gone.
[141:06.90]Can we get an F in chat?
[141:09.58]What did you think was- What did you think was gonna happen?
[141:15.36]Guys.
[141:16.54]If you- If you take a bowling ball, and you hold it over your foot,
[141:23.57]and you let it go over your foot on purpose and smash your foot and break every bone in your foot are you really going to be surprised that you did that?
[141:31.90]like that's the equivalent of oh man like this is ah really hope nothing happens here I'm gonna let this go over my foot oh my foot's broken how did this happen why did this happen to me
[141:53.71]Stop talking over the movie.
[141:57.25]What am I doing?
[141:58.07]The movie's not even on my stream.
[141:59.97]I'm just fucking up my own stream.
[142:10.26]I've nothing to do with somebody streaming a fucking movie.
[142:13.62]What am I supposed to do?
[142:15.74]Like, hey, Twitch, there's a guy streaming a fucking full movie over here with my face on it.
[142:20.34]What am I supposed to say?
[142:25.77]Stop r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r
[142:49.57]You're going to get in fucking trouble.
[142:51.51]It's against the terms of service.
[142:53.05]Don't do it.
[142:54.37]Unless you have the Amazon Presents.
[142:57.13]Watch movies together.
[142:58.72]Which you don't have.
[142:59.82]So you can't do it.
[143:02.32]I'm telling.
[143:02.74]Okay, I'm going to fall off again.
[143:16.63]How do I get around this?
[143:23.44]Kind of hurting my head.
[143:25.82]How did I do this last time?
[143:28.87]Ooh, shit.
[143:29.39]Okay.
[143:29.53]Alright, now don't jump.
[143:34.05]Stay on here.
[143:36.41]All the way around.
[143:36.99]Don't jump.
[143:39.33]Nice.
[143:39.59]Okay, keep going.
[143:45.98]Shit, do I... Do I jump over there?
[143:58.29]How do I get over there?
[143:59.33]Should I jump?
[144:00.55]I'm, like, scared to jump.
[144:01.73]If I jump, I'll fall off.
[144:03.71]Oh, right here.
[144:04.33]Okay, right.
[144:07.23]Then I have to jump from here to there.
[144:10.78]That seemed like it shouldn't have happened.
[144:12.18]That seemed like that was the wrong idea, but apparently it worked.
[144:22.20]I...
[144:28.97]This is fucked up.
[144:30.43]Um... Can I jump this?
[144:39.93]No?
[144:40.21]Okay.
[144:43.71]This is trippy.
[144:45.98]Because we're upside down, and then we're not upside down, and then we're right side up, and then we're sideways, and then we're not sideways.
[144:55.05]And now we're going this way, and now we're not going this way.
[144:58.43]And then I gotta go down here.
[144:59.95]This guy sucks.
[145:05.50]What do you want me to do for you?
[145:10.42]Does this guy ever stop talking?
[145:15.70]What's wrong with you?
[145:19.99]Oh, Bitcoin is up.
[145:23.13]I guess.
[145:34.43]Gimme that, come here!
[145:35.29]I'm gonna ban everyone.
[145:39.49]I can't ban everyone.
[145:49.14]Somebody got it.
[145:50.92]Somebody got it, somebody got it, somebody got it, somebody got it, somebody got it!
[145:55.20]The Mean Machine.
[145:57.00]Gave 10 bucks first of all, but somebody got it.
[145:59.34]This is it.
[146:00.67]For the record, you're thinking of Cineburst gum.
[146:04.52]They marketed themselves as an extreme gum for hip kids in the 80s and early 90s and used a fast-dissolving material for their wrappers.
[146:12.22]It was safe to digest, but was more of a safety precaution for dumb kids than intended feature.
[146:19.41]Yep, I remember.
[146:20.75]This led to a popular urban legend that chewing it with the wrapper on enhanced the flavor crystals, but they never intended for you to actually chew the wrapper.
[146:30.83]That's, you got it.
[146:34.00]Cineburst gum!
[146:34.96]Yep, because they put crystals and it was wrapped up and you chewed through the wrapper and shit.
[146:41.38]Wow, thank you.
[146:45.91]Thank- seriously, that was gonna drive me nuts.
[146:48.91]That was gonna drive me nuts.
[146:50.57]Wow.
[146:51.33]All right, nice.
[146:51.87]Cineburst, right, because it- crystals.
[146:55.83]Boss fight.
[146:56.25]Uh-oh.
[147:03.47]They're coming!
[147:03.81]They're getting in!
[147:04.35]They're coming in! They're coming in! They're coming in! They're coming in! They're coming in!
[147:24.72]QTE fail? I tried it, you watched it in real time.
[147:31.80]What the fuck am I playing?
[147:34.05]This is called Deadly Creatures.
[147:36.00]Nintendo.
[147:36.82]We.
[147:37.14]Alright, let's try this again.
[147:42.44]Thankfully it's right here.
[147:43.24]Let me go look at the dry eyes.
[147:45.46]I feel like I haven't blanked very much.
[147:52.13]Blinked?
[147:56.65]Oh, there's a big one right there.
[148:02.69]Oh, I hate this.
[148:03.77]They're coming faster.
[148:05.57]This actually is fucking with my head.
[148:17.36]It actually fucking... Go!
[148:25.89]What does the red one do?
[148:43.48]Double strike combo.
[148:46.20]Oh, the move list.
[148:47.14]Right, right, right.
[148:51.05]Go for it.
[148:53.15]I just got fucking poisoned.
[148:56.09]How do I stop getting poisoned?
[148:57.07]Is there a way I can get it off?
[149:03.28]Fuck off.
[149:16.03]Alright, watch it.
[149:18.01]Eat him.
[149:20.61]Gotcha.
[149:28.79]New ability, Web Jump.
[149:30.09]You can now fire a line and instantly web jump two patches of spiderweb silk.
[149:36.67]I'm close enough to do a web jump patch.
[149:40.23]C and then aim.
[149:42.45]Oh, that's pretty sick.
[149:48.43]Use web jump to find a way out of the brambles.
[149:53.86]So right over there, and we let it go.
[149:59.14]Wow.
[149:59.90]The spider has way more interesting moves than the scorpion does, that's for sure.
[150:04.42]Scorpion.
[150:05.68]Scorpion.
[150:06.22]Why does it sound like I'm overpronouncing that?
[150:08.06]Scorpion.
[150:10.00]Yeah, it's a scorpion.
[150:10.78]It's a scorpion.
[150:12.76]Scorpion.
[150:13.82]It's a scorpion.
[150:14.56]Yeah.
[150:15.41]I got it.
[150:18.48]Okay, now another one.
[150:26.11]Right there.
[150:37.26]Too far away.
[150:37.94]Shit.
[150:39.70]Is there another one that I don't see?
[150:40.70]How long can a canned soda last?
[150:43.74]I don't know.
[150:44.06]Look at the expiration date, dude.
[150:46.30]Why are you asking me?
[150:47.12]I don't know.
[150:56.41]Can I not reach this?
[150:58.93]Oh, okay.
[150:59.21]Yeah, I can.
[151:10.10]One of these is longer than the other.
[151:11.26]I think it's this one.
[151:15.92]There we go.
[151:20.34]Bug's life or riot.
[151:21.30]You want me to put on a bug's life and get my Twitch channel suspended?
[151:25.98]Because I was already gone for, like, six straight days.
[151:31.74]You'd like me to add another, like, four or five days to that?
[151:35.06]I just got back.
[151:36.12]I just got back.
[151:40.82]Are you losing it?
[151:46.21]Use the watch thing.
[151:50.17]Okay.
[151:51.03]Is A Bug's Life on the Amazon Prime watch together list?
[151:56.58]Is it?
[151:58.82]Is it on there?
[152:09.92]God damn it.
[152:11.14]Is it on there?
[152:23.11]I don't want to watch a fucking bug's life.
[152:26.12]That's gonna take the place of a stream.
[152:27.66]You know that, right?
[152:30.19]That's gonna be exhausting to me.
[152:38.27]That's going to be exhausting.
[152:39.81]I know, it's like, dude, you're just watching a movie in a chair.
[152:42.97]But man, I don't want to do that.
[152:45.87]Like, I could think of anything else I could possibly do with my time.
[152:49.30]And watching a bug's life is absolutely not anything, one of them.
[152:54.78]Everyone's saying, you're lazy, lazy.
[152:57.22]No, I just, I don't want to watch a bug's life.
[153:00.16]But I will if it's on there.
[153:06.81]Why?
[153:08.12]Why?
[153:08.94]Why would I do that?
[153:10.26]Why would I need to say that I would do that?
[153:12.18]That's so meaningless.
[153:13.68]That's so pointless.
[153:23.07]It's not.
[153:23.79]Can you imagine showing up to that one?
[153:30.17]Your aunt's not gonna like that one.
[153:37.00]Wait, why wouldn't your aunt like that?
[153:41.64]Watch Hereditary.
[153:42.56]I've already seen Hereditary.
[153:43.80]It's fucking nuts.
[153:46.16]The movie's fucked up.
[153:56.12]My aunt loves A Bug's Life.
[153:58.69]Oh, well, that's cool.
[153:59.39]Maybe we'll watch it.
[154:04.43]Bounty hunters were still coming after both of them, so they buried the gold out here somewhere.
[154:09.99]It's still in a lockbox that they stole from the Confederates.
[154:14.78]His brother found it later that day, maybe that night, so the Moons gave him a proper burial close by.
[154:20.56]Well, proper as you can get for a deserter now, Lord.
[154:29.68]Jeremy, what is this?
[154:30.49]Yeah!
[155:02.28]Just, it's...
[155:34.14]What do you mean, host?
[155:35.66]Host, what?
[155:38.03]Wrong side.
[155:39.03]No, I was pointing to the left corner.
[155:42.89]Alright, excuse me, I've got to listen to Philly Pop Thornton get $50,000 for a fucking vowel.
[156:03.11]Host of Bugs the...
[156:05.20]No.
[156:07.54]No.
[156:08.72]No.
[156:09.96]We're doing this.
[156:11.49]No.
[156:12.69]I am... No.
[156:15.61]If you want to go get your channel fucking compromised, invite all of me.
[156:20.37]Don't do it.
[156:20.91]Alright.
[156:27.84]I feel like I just went in a whole circle.
[156:29.24]Did I?
[156:32.32]There we are.
[156:37.68]See, this is the thing about all the people that are saying, dude, fucking, you should do, we'll do like the Amazon watch party thing together.
[156:44.57]And those people are going to come to the stream and they're going to watch for 10 minutes and they're going to fucking leave.
[156:54.14]They're going to be gone.
[156:55.58]They'll be gone in less than 10 minutes, less than 15 minutes.
[156:59.78]And then we're, we're holding the fucking, we're holding the earth up.
[157:06.21]That's absolutely true.
[157:08.07]Snake.
[157:16.81]It is pulled him out.
[157:17.61]Did Billy Bob Thornton just pull a snake out with his bare hands?
[157:22.99]A rattlesnake?
[157:34.98]We made it to the Citadel.
[157:38.47]Would you expect anything less?
[157:44.64]The Citadel.
[157:48.12]Alright.
[157:48.88]Over-under here.
[157:50.02]What's the over-under that we're gonna get, like, uh... In the background.
[158:03.77]What's the- what's the over-under?
[158:09.17]50-50, you think?
[158:27.52]No.
[158:29.07]Well, we haven't made it to the Citadel yet, so... That's not accurate.
[158:43.63]What am I talking about?
[158:46.91]Do I actually have to explain that?
[158:58.82]Fuck.
[159:06.32]Right in his head!
[159:07.20]Right in his head!
[159:20.09]Dead?
[159:27.00]It was another one.
[159:33.11]Alright, alright, can we stop giving the Terms of Service Breaker attention at the moment?
[159:40.44]Can we refrain from having this stream be a stream that is directly connected to a stream that is breaking terms of service as we speak right now?
[159:50.61]It's...
[160:08.79]He's draining you.
[160:10.61]All right.
[160:10.95]I'm gonna put the foot down here.
[160:14.81]Stop.
[160:16.03]Stop it.
[160:17.99]Stop it.
[160:19.23]Stop it.
[160:20.94]Stop it.
[160:21.40]I'm like the fucking principal that comes out during recess.
[160:29.98]Okay, kids.
[160:31.44]It's time to come in for recess.
[160:33.68]Yes.
[160:35.19]Oh, none of them are listening at all.
[160:37.31]No one's listening to me.
[160:38.57]Come on, kids.
[160:40.51]Research is over.
[160:41.75]Back to school.
[160:42.77]And there's like a full kickball game still going on.
[160:45.95]And it takes like 30 fucking minutes for all those kids to come back.
[160:52.18]Yeah, I have no control at this point.
[160:59.33]You guys are gonna go play your fucking game of kickball until, until like, until like seven or eight adults come up.
[161:06.38]And all of us in chorus.
[161:08.48]Okay, kids, come on, that's enough!
[161:11.50]Alright, last at bat, last at bat, then bring it in, okay?
[161:18.84]Alright, that, no, no.
[161:19.88]Alright, we'll just let him do it for like another minute or two.
[161:25.47]How many adults is it gonna take to get you guys to come back?
[161:29.98]What do I need to dig?
[161:32.64]What do I dig?
[161:33.94]What do I dig?
[161:35.06]Where do I even dig?
[161:36.06]Why is nobody helping me?
[161:37.34]Why is nobody helping me?
[161:56.68]Oh.
[161:58.49]Found it.
[162:07.07]Uh-oh.
[162:08.83]It's a hornet versus a tarantula.
[162:12.14]New enemy.
[162:14.18]Super hornet.
[162:20.40]Those things are terrifying.
[162:24.66]That's a tarantula wasp?
[162:25.82]I should be okay then, because I'm a scorpion.
[162:50.99]Okay, bye.
[162:52.19]Just gotta watch out when he swings down like that, okay?
[163:00.44]Got it.
[163:00.84]Right in the fucking head.
[163:08.02]Parry?
[163:08.40]There is no parry.
[163:10.22]Oh, this is bad.
[163:13.52]Am I finally gonna get to the surface?
[163:15.36]Invade the Tarantula Hawk's cactus hive.
[163:19.34]That's a terrible idea.
[163:28.72]Use Deadeye.
[163:29.44]Really?
[163:36.63]This far- this far after 2016.
[163:38.33]I'm gonna say that still.
[163:41.71]Come on.
[163:50.80]Really?
[163:52.80]I'm so high right now.
[163:54.18]And I love how some of you guys just decide to tell me that every stream.
[164:00.95]What is happening?
[164:01.89]Oh, it's spitting at me.
[164:04.67]Dude, I'm fucking wicked high, Guillermo.
[164:11.08]Alright.
[164:11.98]Burrow strike.
[164:13.44]Quickly burrow down into soilless sand by turning the Wii Remote upside down and swing the Wii Remote upwards to burrow strike.
[164:32.50]Hold on, do I... Is this working?
[164:48.97]Oh, you have to be on sand.
[164:50.21]I get it.
[164:50.65]Have to be on dirt.
[164:56.57]This game's pretty awesome, actually.
[164:58.01]I really like this game.
[165:00.24]No, that was not a pretend voice.
[165:01.42]I know it sounded like it, but it's not.
[165:13.88]Tarantula Hawk Cave.
[165:22.50]Happy birthday, man.
[165:23.40]It's not my birthday.
[165:38.77]Time to fuck up those wasps.
[165:48.51]I don't... Why do you guys... You guys just love, like, chaos.
[165:56.26]You love just carnage.
[165:59.64]You love just chaos.
[166:03.66]Rats?
[166:04.50]No.
[166:05.10]Big lizard.
[166:09.52]I could... Holy shit, I'm huge.
[166:15.72]Okay.
[166:22.41]The dodge and then... He does a big dash like his big brother does.
[166:46.93]Yes!
[166:47.45]What?
[166:53.61]Oh, come on.
[166:54.77]This is bad.
[166:55.47]I'm gonna lose.
[167:05.23]Holy shit, that was lucky.
[167:06.13]Is he dead?
[167:08.87]Almost.
[167:10.79]Kill.
[167:11.29]Kill.
[167:12.17]Kill.
[167:29.26]That was fucking horrible.
[167:32.56]I like pulled his neck.
[167:34.21]Oh, there's another one.
[167:52.38]He was right behind me!
[168:03.25]Shit.

[168:13.66]Yeah, I gotta look it up.

[168:49.01]Uh... What do you think I have that's valuable here?
[168:56.45]Oh, let me think of the most valuable thing that I own.
[169:01.31]The Dreamcast.
[169:03.33]Uh, the 3DO.
[169:10.15]But, uh, why would the Pawn Stars guys want an old 3DO?
[169:20.77]I don't have, like, an old Civil War musket to bring in.
[169:24.55]I don't have anything, like, old and valuable.
[169:32.84]Alright, let's kill this lizard.
[169:46.72]Alright, what's this new move that people are screaming in my ear for, screaming at me for?
[169:50.78]Okay, move list.
[169:56.81]Double jab, yeah.
[169:58.55]Interest mass.
[170:00.09]Stick.
[170:01.09]Block.
[170:02.03]Dash.
[170:02.75]Tail whip, yeah.
[170:04.25]Uproot, yeah.
[170:05.79]The claw.
[170:09.75]Yeah, we've been doing that.
[170:11.52]Scorpio.
[170:14.77]AA.
[170:16.01]Thrash.
[170:17.31]Okay.
[170:18.61]Dig.
[170:20.08]I've been doing it.
[170:24.02]Shit, I've been doing that.
[170:35.37]I've been doing it.
[170:39.01]Oh, fuck.
[170:39.31]We have to fight the ranch or the hawk again.
[170:43.50]So you're telling me that nature decided to make a hard counter for the tarantula.
[170:48.31]Seems kind of strange.
[171:17.64]Dead, dead, dead, dead.
[171:29.64]Invade the nest.
[171:36.64]Dude, nature is fucked.
[171:41.64]You missed a wink?
[171:44.64]Oh by the way, what do I have that's valuable? Nothing.
[171:49.53]They don't want me on that show.
[171:50.53]What the hell do they want me on that show for?
[171:58.32]Just ban the word wink?
[171:59.92]Yeah, probably.
[172:00.70]Just do it.
[172:02.26]Yeah, you should probably do it.
[172:03.16]Like, an hour or two.
[172:07.06]Chibi Robo.
[172:08.02]No, Gacha Force is more expensive than Chibi Robo.
[172:10.32]Gacha Force is a lot more expensive than Chibi Robo.
[172:13.93]Which, by the way, nobody trusts that, by the way.
[172:15.41]In the pre-stream chat, we were trying to figure out what I would do today.
[172:19.34]And, unanimously, I think, like, only four people voted for it.
[172:22.90]Out of, like, five or six hundred votes.
[172:26.22]You didn't buy Chibi-Robo.
[172:28.79]Oh, I didn't.
[172:30.31]I didn't.
[172:33.17]I didn't buy Chibi-Robo.
[172:34.51]I don't own Chibi-Robo.
[172:37.77]You don't own that game.
[172:39.32]Um...
[172:45.59]But, um... What the fuck is this?
[172:53.49]What's, um... What's in here?
[172:59.20]What is that?
[173:01.90]Interesting.
[173:02.62]It looks like... Uh... This looks like a GameCube disc.
[173:11.64]And it's... It says Chibi Robo on it.
[173:16.71]I don't own this, though.
[173:17.47]I don't own that game.
[173:28.41]Alright, whatever.
[173:28.99]You get it.
[173:29.31]You get it.
[173:35.34]Thing's fuckin'- Thing's pretty valuable!
[173:41.04]I'm- That was a fake!
[173:42.48]I faked you out!
[173:43.18]I'm not gonna do that with Chibi-Robo.
[173:48.00]I just kind of did!
[173:49.18]No, I didn't.
[173:50.16]I would never throw it.
[173:51.08]Are you serious?
[173:52.52]That's a commodity.
[173:55.94]We rented it for a blockbuster.
[173:59.94]It probably wasn't even available at that blockbuster.
[174:04.40]Gacha Force is expensive.
[174:05.50]Gacha Force is really hard to find with a box and original manual.
[174:10.74]That shit's like three or four hundred dollars.
[174:13.58]If you just get the disc gachaforce, that shit's like, uh, it's not, it's not cheap.
[174:20.50]And it's just the dumb disc.
[174:22.68]Not even the fucking manual.
[174:25.55]I sold mine for $400 last year.
[174:27.55]Well, you made some, you made bank.
[174:29.65]That game's worth a lot of money.
[174:30.95]That might be the most, besides Cube of War.
[174:34.15]Cube of War and Gachafors are the two, I think, most expensive games you can find on the GameCube.
[174:39.89]Somebody's gonna be like, Actually!
[174:42.17]I know, I know.
[174:42.89]Which one?
[174:43.49]It's like, Cube of War is like $600.
[174:46.55]Cube of War is like $500 or $600.
[174:51.89]That's a lot of fucking money for a GameCube game.
[174:59.52]Here we go.
[175:04.94]Wait, did somebody say $600 is not a lot of money for a GameCube game?
[175:08.73]What do you consider a lot of money?
[175:10.01]Got it.
[175:21.47]Oh, he's dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy.
[175:26.91]Break his neck again.
[175:32.01]Use it.
[175:38.43]I wish you would stop pretending to own a chibi robot.
[175:47.69]Bad angle.
[175:51.09]Bad angle.
[175:54.61]Like the bad angle.
[176:10.25]Gah!
[176:10.73]I dodged... I'm trying to go that way!
[176:15.69]You fucking idiot!
[176:40.72]One more?
[176:41.04]Or is that it?
[176:45.52]Woo!
[176:49.41]Prove you own chibi robot.
[176:50.77]Put it in the Wii.
[176:52.77]I'm in the middle of something right now.
[176:54.35]If you can't- I'm not sure you can tell, but I'm in the middle of something.
[177:01.94]Go inside the eye.
[177:03.84]Show the receipt.
[177:07.87]Sure, okay guys, yeah, what do you- no, I'm not gonna give you that.
[177:15.66]I'm up?
[177:21.78]I'm on this ceiling.
[177:24.20]He doesn't have it.
[177:24.96]Are you guys drunk?
[177:43.54]Tell me your credit card security number to tell me.
[177:53.89]You know, there's... There was this idea that I had.
[177:57.45]You guys remember the Christmas stream, right?
[178:00.89]Where I was like, hey, I'm gonna give you guys like 500 bucks to just buy random shit and I'll just cover it, whatever.
[178:06.38]Like, I'll just pay for it, right?
[178:09.25]There was this, like, theory that it was, like, I don't think I could have ever done it.
[178:14.13]Where you guys, like, have to use, like, I would just, it would be terrible.
[178:19.63]And it wouldn't work out at all.
[178:21.21]And the idea got thrown in the trash can immediately when it popped in my head.
[178:25.14]But, like, if I bought, like, a fucking Visa gift card and just, like, showed it.
[178:31.22]And just, like, see what somebody bought.
[178:34.40]But that's a, that's a fucking, that's not gonna work out.
[178:41.88]Like, it's not gonna work out.
[178:46.18]Like, what would happen?
[178:47.88]What would actually happen?
[178:49.85]You know what I mean?
[178:50.69]Have, like, the statement over here on one monitor.
[178:54.07]And be like, one, two, three, there's a number.
[178:56.45]And just, like, capture the window of the statement.
[179:00.13]And refresh it every five seconds.
[179:03.63]And then I think, okay, that's like, that would never work.
[179:06.79]Because people would just buy a bunch of fucked up shit.
[179:10.68]And it would come leading back to me.
[179:13.54]So- No!
[179:13.88]What was that for?
[179:26.57]Oh, can I- Am I gonna move this rock?
[179:38.61]Oh, damn.
[179:39.19]Alright.
[179:41.87]Let's go.
[179:42.57]Frog!
[179:42.77]Nope.
[179:43.31]Thought it was a frog.
[179:44.71]I got excited.
[179:58.79]Burrow strike.
[179:59.43]Yeah, I know burrow strike.
[180:00.49]I know burrow strike.
[180:01.47]I know this shit already.
[180:11.00]You guys are fucked.
[180:20.60]Your chat is lewd.
[180:22.64]I'm trying to make them better.
[180:26.70]You guys can be better.
[180:28.44]I'm trying to make you guys better.
[180:29.72]Get this off me.
[180:30.50]You can't.
[180:44.27]Is he burying a body?
[180:45.37]No, wait, they're digging for gold?
[180:47.09]Ow, my finger!
[180:47.49]Get the fuck off me!
[180:48.23]That hurt my fingernail.
[181:13.58]You have to kill them.
[181:14.92]Whoa, hold on.
[181:16.42]Hey, man, is this valuable?
[181:17.91]No, it's quartz.
[181:19.95]Well, that's some kind of crystal, right?
[181:21.83]You know, like all them shopping networks on TV.
[181:24.95]Get digging.

[184:38.79]That's one of the best movies ever made.
[184:40.09]So, I mean, that sounds good.

[184:52.80]Not true.

[184:54.20]No, it's not.
[184:54.76]Holy shit.

[187:00.01]I'm going to step over Rotten Tomatoes.
[187:02.40]I'm going to the Library of Congress.
[187:10.36]Who framed Roger Rabbit is so good that they put it into the Library of Congress.
[187:19.49]They only do that for movies that are considered to be pieces that must be fucking preserved.
[187:25.69]Forever.
[187:26.07]They must be.
[187:28.35]This isn't like Cars 2.
[187:29.51]Like, this isn't Pineapple Express.
[187:45.61]I'm sorry.
[187:46.99]I'm going to have to overstep you here.
[187:56.74]What do you mean I hated Cars 2?
[187:58.56]Wait, hold on.
[188:00.67]Library of Congress.
[188:03.61]Cars 2.
[188:04.07]SHIT!
[188:41.47]All right, whatever it's point still stands cars to I mean cars is a multi billion dollar Multilingual multinational franchise that has seen hundreds of billions of views in the movie theaters It makes sense that that would be in the Library of Congress.
[188:59.76]It's a multi Localized it's been seen in 500 countries Okay, it makes all right.
[189:06.74]Yes Okay, are the minions in there?

[189:20.01]No, they're not.
[189:21.05]No, the Minions movie is not in the Library of Congress.
[189:24.41]Um, apparently it doesn't classify.
[189:26.62]The Minions don't get to be there.
[189:36.44]There's literally porn in the Library of Congress.
[189:40.39]Yeah, what's the problem there?
[189:43.82]If an asteroid hits Earth, and like six million years in the future, aliens land, and they find the Library of Congress archive.
[189:51.92]I mean, we want to show them what we got, I guess.
[190:05.45]Wait, then our...
[190:10.21]I mean let's be realistic don't you think they would be curious remember an asteroid hit earth and we've been dead for 5 000 years don't you think they'd like to know how we like procreated for all they know we could like link up tubes on our heads and like they don't know why would they know
[190:40.85]We've been dis- we've been ex- distinct- we've been extinct for 5,000 years!

[192:57.17]My voice, like, was, like, trailing off a little too long.
[193:00.91]Yeah, that was terrible.
[193:01.91]That was really, really, really bad.
[193:03.31]Remember, get in front of it.
[193:05.01]Like, if I, like... People can't clip that now and go, wow, holy shitty, sounds fucking, like, stupid here.

[195:32.11]Now hold on a minute.
[195:33.41]Now hold on a minute.

[197:13.62]Look at me!
[197:15.94]This is Pickle Rick.
[197:21.73]Some of you guys, man.
[197:22.69]It's like that old thing, like, uh, like, oh, you do funny?
[197:49.75]Tell me a joke!
[197:51.47]Okay, Dad.
[197:52.25]Oh, yeah, I heard you're quite the funny guy.
[197:55.71]I heard you stream on Twitch and you fucking do funny stuff.
[197:58.02]Why don't you tell me a joke right now, son?
[198:01.52]Um, okay, Mr. Stevenson.
[198:04.30]Um, I would, um, I can't.
[198:09.72]I thought you were supposed to be fucking funny, kid.
[198:12.78]You know, when I was younger, I told all kinds of funny jokes.
[198:16.13]How about this one?
[198:22.38]Like, oh, you're a clown?
[198:23.22]Make me laugh!
[198:28.73]I ripped off Louis C.K.?
[198:31.33]Oh.
[198:33.65]He's very, he's got a very good point, let me tell you, I guess.
[198:38.03]I guess, I don't know.
[198:48.64]What, what's going on here?
[198:52.71]Ohhhhh!
[198:54.01]That was another bad one!
[198:56.85]That one was not intentional.
[198:58.71]That one was just bad.
[199:00.99]That one was way worse.
[199:03.17]But it was not even really intentional.
[199:09.94]God.
[199:12.10]Oh, here comes Billy Bob Thornton to say this and that and this.
[199:15.54]And there and there, I'll take two million.
[199:20.42]That was a Seinfeld noise?
[199:32.55]If he doesn't say a joke soon, I'm gonna leave.
[199:35.47]Nice to- Good to see you.
[199:39.27]Oh, look at all these jumps.
[199:47.84]No, no.
[199:48.88]I'm not going to click on illegal streams.
[199:52.54]No.
[199:53.18]I'm sorry.
[199:54.82]You guys do whatever the fuck you want in your own chair.
[199:57.08]I'm not doing it.
[199:58.99]I'm not clicking on a Terms of Service, like, Cars 2 stream.
[200:02.85]Okay?
[200:03.93]No, I'm not going to do it.
[200:06.20]Because then if I do it, then it gives precedence for you to do it.
[200:10.68]And then we all get in trouble.
[200:13.80]Don't look at that zip.
[200:38.45]You guys are fucking crazy.
[200:43.48]Oh, that was a one-hit kill.
[200:46.34]Stealth Pounce.
[200:51.30]And then press A. Okay, let's try it.
[200:57.91]Holy shit.
[200:58.87]That is like Hunter in Left 4 Dead range.
[201:10.01]For me, your existence alone is funny.
[201:12.07]With a smile.
[201:12.63]What was that supposed to mean?
[201:21.40]What is that supposed to mean?
[201:27.55]Your life is a joke.
[201:34.34]When did we release all the rude viewers?
[201:38.68]Did they all come out at the same time?
[201:40.82]What time is it?
[201:52.23]They're always here.
[202:02.22]Dude, that's the best move in the whole game.
[202:10.80]Who's hitting me?
[202:14.26]Rude.
[202:15.32]He thinks this is rude?

[203:24.75]I can't get in this.
[203:27.75]It wants me to go, like, up here.
[203:30.01]But- uh, what?
[203:37.61]Ah, okay.
[203:48.54]Good.
[203:51.18]The game's level design is actually kind of good.
[203:55.27]It's interesting.
[203:55.99]A game like this could be really, really fucking confusing.
[204:01.83]And... It's not.
[204:05.03]The arrow helps if you need it.
[204:06.77]Which I do.
[204:09.67]A game you can go upside down...
[204:13.35]I appreciate the fact that there's a little arrow.
[204:15.94]Just, it's so easy.
[204:17.90]It's such a simple little tool.
[204:20.22]It's perfect.
[204:21.62]Happy birthday.
[204:22.36]Go fuck yourself.
[204:23.12]What are you talking about?
[204:29.83]Arrow's cheating.
[204:32.41]It's rude.
[204:33.01]All these rude viewers today.
[204:34.61]Why is it being so rude?
[204:38.07]What the heck is going on in here?
[204:43.11]The heck are you doing?
[204:47.80]It's my birthday today.
[204:49.24]You can't be rude to me on my birthday.
[204:50.82]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[204:53.54]I don't want to restart this whole fucking area.
[205:02.77]Now I know what's going on.
[205:04.69]I know what's going on.
[205:06.51]This is because I didn't watch the Bugs Life stream and I told you guys to stop watching it.
[205:10.50]Now I get it.
[205:11.84]That's what happened.
[205:15.10]That's where all this comes from.
[205:20.04]Oh my god, there's two of them.
[205:20.98]AHHHHH!
[205:49.35]Cops!
[205:49.91]Cops!

[207:41.86]Say happy birthday to me.
[207:44.34]Happy birthday in a couple months.
[207:49.63]First time we've seen this.
[207:59.78]Look, that's all the progress.

[208:03.00]We got all the way up here.
[208:12.52]German, watch classic wrestling.
[208:14.90]Doesn't that WWE network or the WWE app or whatever allow you to watch... ...full episodes of Raw from like 2002 and stuff?

[208:28.29]I could have guessed.
[208:30.17]I could have guessed.
[208:30.65]Where the fuck am I going?
[208:46.06]Don't fall, don't fall, don't fall.

[209:38.30]I beat Ikaruga.
[209:43.48]I beat Ikaruga on stream, actually.
[209:46.64]Okay, I beat Ikaruga on stream with a little bit of help.
[209:51.24]I... I beat Ikaruga on stream by cheating on some of the levels.
[209:55.26]On all the levels.
[209:56.81]I cheated on Ikaruga on the normal difficulty.
[210:03.15]Okay.
[210:17.32]Finally, we're gonna...

[211:18.94]Got it.
[211:19.52]Journey to the Citadel Cactus.

[212:09.89]Holy sh- I hit the fucking cricket.
[212:16.71]Are you serious?
[212:17.71]I did all that to hit the cricket that was next to him?
[212:21.33]Whoa, good move.
[212:28.58]He's dazed.
[212:28.94]Get him!
[212:42.58]Got him.
[212:49.99]Play Viva Pinata.
[212:50.87]I don't think you want me to do that.
[212:56.68]Feed, feed, feed.
[213:04.57]No, I'm not going to play Viva Pinata.
[213:09.89]Got him in the air.
[213:11.67]Shoot again.
[213:15.14]Oh.

[213:23.00]You're just saying that because you know how I feel about Mario Kart.
[213:28.66]Can you feed him?
[213:32.41]Alright, this is like a big long corridor.
[213:35.25]Climb up.
[213:35.63]Alright, up there.
[213:50.31]Right there.
[213:53.52]And then... Where's the next one?
[214:02.40]Right there?
[214:02.88]Oh, I'm upside down.
[214:05.51]No, what?
[214:06.29]What just happened?
[214:15.31]Could I really just fall on my back?
[214:18.94]Or flat on my back?
[214:22.06]How far away was that?
[214:31.55]WWE Network stream.
[214:39.32]Oh, that's pretty far.
[214:58.01]Watch WWE?
[214:59.31]No, I'm not gonna watch WWE right now.
[215:02.71]I'm trying to play the spider game.
[215:04.27]End of the stream, boys?
[215:08.58]Uh, not quite.

[215:11.02]Not quite.
[215:13.30]Not quite.
[215:16.52]Not quite.
[215:26.55]Dude, I like Rey Mysterio.
[215:27.79]Rey Mysterio is fucking awesome.
[215:32.99]Alright, I'm gonna go this way.
[215:34.77]When is Hulk?
[215:36.13]Uh, so, because of the coronavirus, Amazon is not shipping a lot of stuff.
[215:44.25]Or it's delayed.
[215:46.03]Like, prime two-day shipping doesn't really exist.
[215:49.87]So, it's kind of just...
[215:53.35]It's going to come when it comes.
[215:54.99]It's going to get here when it gets... It will get here when it gets here.
[215:57.77]You said you would buy it a month ago.
[215:58.95]I know.
[216:01.47]I know.
[216:05.23]He's lying?
[216:06.14]No, I'm not.
[216:08.10]Go to Hulk Ultimate Destruction on the GameCube right now on Amazon and find one.
[216:12.96]The shipping dates are within the next couple weeks.
[216:18.56]Things are coming faster than you think.
[216:19.80]It's just giving out a date just in case.
[216:21.50]Well, okay.
[216:21.92]There we go.
[216:25.69]I don't lie about everything, guys.
[216:26.95]Just most stuff.
[216:31.40]30 webcams!
[216:32.16]That's also impossible, too.
[216:34.06]Because, also due to the coronavirus, webcams are in very short supply right now.
[216:40.68]And so they're either completely out of stock, or they're $200 for one.
[216:50.18]That's also another unfortunate thing.
[216:57.23]Why is the game... Why is this game $77?
[216:58.80]Why is the game $77?
[216:59.88]Wait, why is... What do you mean?
[217:05.68]Microphones too.
[217:06.88]Yeah, but it makes sense though.
[217:09.54]It makes sense because tons of people are working from home and conferencing from home and people are communicating over, you know, the social distancing.
[217:20.24]So it makes sense as to why the webcams wouldn't be really something that's very, very readily available right now.
[217:30.36]Uh, but, yeah, we just, we have to figure that out whenever those come back into stock.
[217:34.67]Maybe we can see how things are and get them done.
[217:39.63]Alright, I gotta, okay, I'm, like, upside down.
[217:41.39]Let me see what the hell I'm doing.
[217:44.73]Play Viscera.
[217:48.15]Hold on.
[217:48.85]Let me just, let me just get through this part first.
[217:53.45]I think I've done, like, every level in Viscera cleanup, haven't I?
[218:02.53]No.
[218:03.45]Play House Flipper.
[218:04.15]Well, when they add something new, I'll play it.
[218:07.27]House Flipper has been the same game since Garden Flipper.
[218:10.57]I played that.
[218:17.82]They did.
[218:18.20]When?
[218:19.40]What did they add?
[218:19.90]What is it?
[218:20.56]What is it?
[218:23.42]They added space.
[218:26.92]Wait, are we talking about Visper Cleanup or are we talking about House Flipper?
[218:28.90]House Flipper.
[218:40.58]I can see anything.
[218:42.41]Oh, I'm going right away.
[218:43.87]How's both?
[218:44.39]Alright, we saw this.
[218:47.93]We can't skip it, though.
[218:48.76]You got the map?
[218:49.66]Help me up.
[219:04.02]These guys.
[219:06.02]What's this?
[219:08.08]Alright.
[219:11.81]Somebody's watching another movie on Twitch with my likeness on it.
[219:21.07]Explain the plot.
[219:21.85]You're a fucking mean bug.
[219:25.07]See?
[219:25.57]I didn't even do that.
[219:26.19]He did that on his own.
[219:26.97]Alright, let's go.
[219:32.73]This part was hard, and I got killed.
[219:34.87]I fell off the fucking thing.
[219:36.73]Getting to the top of the cactus.
[219:39.03]And only then can I stop this stream.
[219:45.35]Bug wars.
[219:46.07]24 hours straight?
[219:58.57]No, it's not gonna take that long.
[219:59.95]Just can't fall off the edge.
[220:04.70]I want a spill joke.
[220:05.69]I can't do spill jokes.
[220:07.91]Not that they were on purpose anyways, but like a spill joke is bad.
[220:10.83]I have spilled shit on this desk.
[220:13.15]When I first put this desk together, those of you that remember, I spilled an entire fucking 16 ounce thing of coffee on it.
[220:20.01]Like the third or fourth day that I got it.
[220:22.37]And it was infuriating.
[220:24.03]The stream was delayed by like an hour and a half.
[220:26.52]And I was so fucking angry on stream.
[220:28.32]Some of you guys might remember it.
[220:31.11]Yeah.
[220:31.63]But I don't wanna... I don't wanna... I don't wanna... I like this desk!
[220:34.95]I don't wanna just rule it with, like, a soda!
[220:37.23]Or, like, a coffee!
[220:38.67]When was that?
[220:39.11]Like, a year and a half ago.
[220:41.93]I don't remember anything.
[220:43.01]Yes, you do.
[220:44.33]You remember.
[220:49.64]What?
[220:50.76]No, jump on him!
[220:53.30]Finally, I got him!
[220:54.66]Feed!
[220:56.16]Why didn't I just try to feed on him?
[220:58.26]Feed!
[221:01.14]A and then what he's... That didn't work.
[221:09.83]Alright.
[221:10.71]This is where I fell off.
[221:11.47]When are you going to watch the March 12th episode of Raw?
[221:21.05]What?
[221:21.89]I don't even... I don't... Guy!
[221:23.76]You did...
[221:30.94]Okay.
[221:33.40]I don't watch Brawl.
[221:34.90]I don't watch wrestling anymore.
[221:38.57]The last time that I actually saw- the last time I watched wrestling was Hell in a Cell.
[221:42.23]It was like a few years ago.
[221:45.11]And I remember watching and going, well, this is not- this is like really not good.
[221:49.79]Every event, they took- they tried to like break a table like four times.
[221:54.93]And it, like, didn't work.
[221:56.37]I think that, like, they was like, here comes the table!
[221:58.49]And, like, they couldn't get somebody to break through the table.
[222:00.43]I remember being like, whoa, this is... They, like, can't do that now.
[222:04.77]Why... Just watch WrestleMania 17.
[222:08.50]I don't even know what one are they on.
[222:11.66]30?
[222:13.36]What WrestleMania are they on right now?
[222:22.70]I didn't eat him?
[222:27.06]Around 30.
[222:27.28]36.
[222:27.34]Okay.
[222:28.02]Alright, here we go.
[222:30.60]Let's go.
[222:42.87]I'm not closing it.
[222:45.55]What the fuck?
[222:48.09]Hey!
[222:54.50]Hey!
[222:54.74]Hey!
[222:59.99]Okay, now we gotta go this way.
[223:05.26]Did I do it again?
[223:05.72]Did I do the same thing I did last time again?
[223:22.95]Just go up here.
[223:45.47]Starting to hurt my head.
[223:49.47]Starting to... This area in particular is starting to make me sick.
[224:01.52]Alright.
[224:02.56]Up.
[224:03.10]Up.
[224:03.56]Over there.
[224:03.92]Okay.
[224:06.34]I made it.
[224:08.56]Stop squishing your face.
[224:09.44]Well, I have to.
[224:10.07]Otherwise I'll throw up.
[224:18.05]I'm sure you guys would like that.
[224:19.11]There we go.
[224:22.02]Saved.
[224:26.98]Alright, so what's the deal here?
[224:28.14]I wonder how many of you... Okay, I've reached the lizard.
[224:35.79]I did it!
[224:40.57]Well, there's a trap.
[224:51.84]It's just two.
[224:52.36]It's not bad.
[224:52.78]I did this before.
[224:55.04]I'm going for a pounce.
[224:59.09]No, I'm not.
[225:00.23]That was dumb.
[225:03.39]Just don't get hit.
[225:24.21]Feed!
[225:24.55]Feed!
[225:24.85]Feed!
[225:25.13]Feed!
[225:25.41]Feed!
[225:26.25]How come it only works, like, some of the time?
[225:27.57]I don't get it.
[225:31.67]It's like Double Dragon, just keep doing the kick.
[225:34.17]What the fuck?
[225:44.05]There's more?
[225:56.52]How many more do I have to kill?
[226:02.94]Oh!
[226:03.10]I don't know why I'm even trying to do that.
[226:08.76]There's gonna be a huge one that falls after this, I guarantee it.
[226:30.56]Alright, that was stupid.
[226:31.55]That was really dumb.
[226:38.17]Alright, get up.
[226:38.63]I can't die here.
[226:39.97]Shit, he dodged it.
[226:59.22]Got it.
[227:00.22]Feed!
[227:11.29]Crawl upside down.
[227:12.45]You can now crawl upside down.
[227:14.25]Couldn't I do that already?
[227:17.09]Into the octopus canyon?
[227:21.47]Why do I have to go in the octopus canyon?
[227:33.47]We want a spill joke.
[227:37.95]What the fuck are you talking about?
[227:40.11]Alright, you know the last time I played Viceroy?
[227:46.07]People were, like, doing resident sleepers and shit.
[227:50.01]You guys gotta come to, like, a consensus.
[227:55.46]You guys gotta come to a... And even if you do, remember, I've got the ultimate veto.
[228:00.64]This thing.
[228:02.02]I stamped that down.
[228:04.38]I'm the guy with the ultimate veto.
[228:08.09]We'll see what I want to play, right?
[228:10.73]Ultimate veto.
[228:11.93]Stamp.
[228:12.19]What does that say?
[228:14.39]Veto.
[228:16.29]Capital is red.
[228:17.57]All red letters in a big red box.
[228:20.13]V-E-T-O.
[228:25.49]O-T-T-O.
[228:29.45]You're quick.
[228:29.98]I'll give you it.
[228:42.94]Extreme paint brawl.
[228:44.46]That game doesn't even run.
[228:47.02]That game notoriously is known for a game that doesn't run.
[228:58.49]Smash Bros.
[228:59.09]Brawl.
[228:59.45]Now that's a new one. ...
[229:15.30]Okay, here we go.
[229:16.86]Here we go.
[229:17.46]Everybody, everybody just yell out your favorite game.
[229:21.44]Alright, let's go.
[229:22.09]I'll do it too.
[229:58.03]Play math game?
[229:58.93]I don't know.
[230:04.90]Play math game.
[230:07.02]I questioned my own comment.
[230:08.50]This is cool looking.
[230:09.70]Octopus cavern.
[230:13.80]Cool math games.
[230:14.68]We already did that.
[230:15.40]A horned lizard!
[230:29.93]Oh, I can't jump on him.
[230:30.91]He hurts.
[230:48.38]I don't want to hurt the Horned Lizard.
[230:49.46]He's kind of... I like Horned Lizards.
[230:50.80]They're cool.
[230:51.82]Wait, he called an AT.
[231:00.68]Is this a fight that would really happen in nature?
[231:02.98]Would a tarantula fight a fucking horned lizard?
[231:04.70]That seems kind of... Oh, they spit blood out of their eyes!
[231:13.24]I remember that shit.
[231:15.13]They spit blood out of their fucking eyes, don't they?
[231:18.95]Yeah!
[231:19.81]Yup.
[231:20.49]I remember this thing.
[231:21.13]This is the blood spouting eye... lizard.
[231:25.73]I think that actually has another name.
[231:30.93]Oh, he's in the spikes!
[231:38.68]Got him.
[231:39.34]Chat is ignorant.
[231:41.30]What, because they didn't know that lizard shoots blood out of its eye?
[231:50.19]Check the spider moves?
[231:51.49]Let's check them.
[231:56.79]Jump, strike, swipe, overthrow.
[231:59.03]That's when you like lift him up.
[232:02.21]Jump strike, we do that.
[232:03.95]Spin attack, I do that.
[232:05.37]Web shot, I do that.
[232:06.55]Venom pounce, that's hard to do.
[232:07.94]It takes too long.
[232:08.78]Double strike, yep, and then you buzzsaw.
[232:15.12]So A, then hold A, and then shake left and right.
[232:17.68]Okay.
[232:20.24]Stealth pounce.
[232:21.70]Speed.
[232:22.02]Let's try buzzsaw.
[232:35.09]I don't think I'm doing that right.
[232:42.09]Can spiders shoot blood out of their eyes?
[232:43.59]I don't think so.
[232:45.39]I don't think they can.
[232:51.16]No more spiders, too.
[233:00.72]Okay!
[233:13.07]That's the new thing now.
[233:13.91]When I'm about to, like, end the stream, when the stream's coming to a close.
[233:18.62]Okay!
[233:20.38]And that's how you guys know.
[233:21.50]Ah!
[233:21.66]Here we go.
[233:22.28]It comes again.
[233:26.79]I'm not- I'm no longer gonna be like, Alright, so this is kinda cool.
[233:32.02]Hmm, so we got... Uh, where do I go now?
[233:37.12]I think... Okay.
[233:40.58]Um, I... Yeah, I... It's, uh... Hold on just a second here.
[233:53.47]That's my favorite bug!
[233:54.25]That's the praying mantis!
[233:55.79]We'll see once and for all who fucking can win.
[233:58.21]We'll see.
[233:58.77]Remember I told you it was frog, then praying mantis?
[234:09.58]Watch out.
[234:10.72]Fuck.
[234:13.31]Alright.
[234:13.85]He got me one hit.
[234:22.89]Got him.
[234:23.97]It's a good fight.
[234:24.55]I thought I pressed C. Shit.
[234:33.76]Fuck.
[234:43.15]Fuck, he's fucking hard.
[234:44.92]Praying Mantis is so strong in the fucking real world, in games and stuff, I guess.
[235:03.15]He almost- it was close.
[235:05.73]It was pretty close.
[235:09.98]You can now chop your pinchers.
[235:18.18]It's a Super Monkey Ball waiting room.
[235:20.02]You're gonna be waiting a long time!
[235:25.67]How old are you now?
[235:27.81]How old are you?
[235:28.65]Oh, by the extreme caps and screaming at the streamer, I've got to assume that you're under the age of fucking 16.
[235:36.82]So, let's find out.
[235:39.04]Let's just write no caps to the streamer.
[235:41.56]Let's see.
[235:42.20]I'm curious.
[235:43.40]Let's find out.
[235:44.82]I'm 35.

[237:04.41]Oh, I was angry.
[237:05.89]Let me be like this.
[237:08.73]All right.
[237:09.21]So, uh...

[237:17.57]Oh, yeah?
[237:18.17]Can you?
[237:18.53]Because what I'm doing here is I'm building a fucking energy.
[237:21.79]And I'm just gonna fucking... It's gonna be a god... It's gonna be a spirit bomb that comes out of me.
[237:27.41]You don't want to punch me when I'm in my closed position.

[240:44.30]You still haven't played Beautiful Joe.
[240:48.04]No, I haven't.
[240:49.44]This game is fun though.
[240:50.78]I like this one.
[240:57.97]What's wrong with having a Fortnite game?
[241:01.87]What?
[241:03.70]I can't understand you.
[241:05.42]I can't even understand you.
[241:06.72]Say that again.
[241:07.24]I can't understand what you're saying.
[241:11.86]Oh.
[241:14.86]Oh, okay.
[241:19.34]Speak up, Sonny.
[241:20.24]All right.
[241:23.21]Here's the deal.
[241:24.91]So we're going to continue with our new plan here of four to five-ish hours.
[241:33.77]Four or five days a week.
[241:34.55]I'm going to start it today.
[241:37.35]I'm going to call it here.
[241:39.05]We're going to give it a try.
[241:42.49]You have to stay longer.
[241:43.29]I'm not done bullying you.
[241:44.91]And that person for 30 minutes.
[241:48.85]What if I have showers a day?
[241:50.39]That would be fucked up.
[241:53.61]Alright.
[241:54.95]So on... We're going to do... So today... We're going to do Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, probably Saturday.
[242:01.94]We're going to do nothing tomorrow.
[242:03.26]And we're going to do four days in a row.
[242:05.32]So we're going to try this.
[242:06.84]We're going to try like four or five hour streams, four or five days a week.
[242:13.66]Am I going to do Animal Crossing?
[242:15.58]Yeah, it's just that's been the one thing that we can do that's at the other place reliably.
[242:22.34]So it's not here.
[242:25.90]It's for three streams per day.
[242:31.77]That'd be a lot.
[242:33.93]But, uh, we're gonna give it a try.
[242:35.26]This game's really cool.
[242:38.86]This game's really cool.
[242:42.42]December this week.
[242:43.22]We'll see.
[242:44.06]I don't know about that.
[242:46.60]I'm gonna O-T-T-O that one.
[242:49.71]Uh, anyways.
[242:53.51]Uh... We got plenty of things to play.
[242:59.55]Just a question of what we want to play next.
[243:03.04]I still want to play Resident Evil 3.
[243:05.76]Maybe Hulk Ultimate Destruction actually will come in.
[243:08.64]And it won't be the shipping date that it actually has.
[243:13.13]We'll see.
[243:14.59]There's also No More Heroes.
[243:15.67]There's also... I do have The Beautiful Joes.
[243:19.11]I do have Saw for Xbox 360, which don't ask me why I own that game, but I do.
[243:33.56]Please play that.
[243:39.70]And then, yeah, Community Content Night exists as well.
[243:44.72]But we'll see.
[243:46.36]I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[243:47.46]We're going to try this new schedule out.
[243:48.97]I'm going to give it a go.
[243:52.55]Thanks for sticking around.
[243:54.79]There were a lot of fucking people here today.
[244:05.12]Where's the shoe?
[244:06.40]Go watch the beginning of the stream.
[244:08.86]I promise you that there is a shoe somewhere in that first little while.
[244:14.38]You'll see it.
[244:16.50]Do I eat it?
[244:17.30]That's something you're going to have to find out on your own.
[244:21.76]Take one more bite.
[244:23.44]It's gone.
[244:24.30]I can't.
[244:26.08]Alright, I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[244:26.94]We're going to move to the bits and subs and all that good stuff.
[244:32.34]It was a lot of fucking money today.
[244:35.34]A lot.
[244:38.62]I will donate $50 if you watch WWE right now.
[244:41.47]I'd rather you spend that $50 on yourself, not on me.
[244:43.87]Because I'm not going to watch WWE.
[244:48.39]Use that and buy yourself a WWE subscription.
[244:54.68]Buy yourself a WWE subscription, sir.
[244:57.38]For like six months.
[245:01.12]But anyways, let's go back to earlier.
[245:08.99]To LM man, 500 bits from LM man.
[245:11.49]Jerma, you are a coward for not eating a shoe.
[245:13.82]Hey, sure did have to eat.
[245:16.60]Hey, sure had to eat those words, didn't you?
[245:20.58]Like I did.
[245:21.10]Hey, Wembley TTV, thanks for the 250 boopers, chads.
[245:26.56]Rise up.
[245:27.10]I don't even know what that means, but I said it.
[245:28.88]Hey, Devakitty, thanks for the 250 for sale.
[245:32.08]Streamer's shoes never eaten.
[245:38.17]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250.
[245:39.15]Hey, I don't want to seem weird, but you look good today.
[245:41.57]Also, the shoe bit was stupid.
[245:48.26]Good.
[245:54.16]Thank you, though.
[245:55.58]LMman500Bits, I apologize, Jerma.
[245:57.79]I was too rash.
[245:59.15]You were a brave, wild man for eating a shoe.
[246:01.11]Something that chat will never do, for we are true cowards.
[246:12.08]Some of you may have eaten a shoe before, I don't know.
[246:15.58]This is gonna be so many fucked up images from that, I can already tell.
[246:24.09]You don't know anything.
[246:33.86]Uh, mad, thanks for the five dollars.
[246:35.90]Haha, funny shoe eater streamer.
[246:37.84]Has sensitive baby feet, has to wear sugar shoes like an oompa loompa.
[246:42.58]Very stinky streamer, haha, stream joke.
[246:45.31]Poopoo peepee, put it on Reddit, get his toes.
[246:48.45]For real, good luck on house hunting.
[246:52.47]I can't, man.
[246:55.07]You guys, alright.
[246:57.43]You guys dialed it up a little bit here.
[246:59.56]You dialed up like the crack...
[247:07.60]Some words shouldn't be spoken.
[247:09.22]I had to turn the stream off because somebody said he pooh-poohs out of his eyes and shit.
[247:15.57]Like, I... I... You were gone for a week.
[247:23.29]Is this the pent-up energy of everybody that just is gonna scream at me?
[247:43.36]You just shouldn't have read that comment.
[247:45.20]That's like asking a bee not to produce honey.
[247:49.80]It's all they do.
[247:50.67]They don't do anything else.
[247:51.57]All I do is read your comments that say crazy fucking shit.
[247:55.39]I have to.
[248:07.32]Anyways, let's keep going.
[248:09.14]Hey Jason, thanks for the $2.50.
[248:12.18]Jason, thank you.
[248:12.84]No, that just means I'm staying loose.
[248:25.88]The looser that I stay, the better that I feel.
[248:29.10]That's kind of the reasoning for pulling streams back, but adding stream days.
[248:34.32]So I can stream essentially the same amount of time, but spread out for less time per stream.
[248:40.89]Because I can stay loose easier that way.
[248:43.29]That's the idea.
[248:44.73]See if it works.
[248:47.97]But thank you JZZB for the thousand bits.
[248:52.41]Sorry you had to eat that shoe.
[248:53.51]It was probably really gross and sugary.
[248:57.38]Isn't that bad?
[248:58.84]It actually was pretty good.
[249:00.66]I didn't hate it.
[249:01.24]Click the link.
[249:01.86]Click the link.
[249:02.40]Click the link.
[249:02.94]Click the link.
[249:03.48]Click the link.
[249:03.98]Full moon crack.
[249:05.08]Full moon crack.
[249:06.10]Full moon crack.
[249:08.38]Oh, God.
[249:08.92]Got the hair down perfectly.
[249:23.93]Oh, Jesus.
[249:24.55]Jesus.
[249:32.76]You know why it was a crack stream today?
[249:36.22]Because I probably should have saved the eat the shoe for the end of the stream.
[249:44.20]Because eating the shoe in the very beginning was like, oh, whoa, we're going to fucking a million right now.
[249:52.15]It got everybody too excited.
[250:00.96]up too early so I riled everybody up and then it's like all right let's play this spider game yeah you can't you like can't go play like the spider game after you eat a fucking shoe on camera I that's my mistake we're kindergarten children
[250:36.22]movies stop saying that all right you're freaking me out stop stop all right stop stop linking people streaming movies here like you're gonna get us all in trouble
[250:59.66]Alright, give me a little bit of slack here.
[251:02.94]Like, half the time that I looked over during this stream, it was somebody linking an illegal movie stream.
[251:16.91]Four times the illegality.
[251:19.19]It wasn't that often.
[251:20.31]Oh, it was.
[251:20.96]It was.
[251:22.28]It was every ten seconds.
[251:23.96]I'm embellishing, but whatever.
[251:25.38]It was every, like, four minutes.
[251:27.92]It was every ten seconds.
[251:34.63]Officially endorsed.
[251:35.89]No!
[251:39.76]Oh my fucking god.
[251:40.82]That person's gonna get banned.
[251:42.10]You're gonna get banned for life.
[251:43.64]Just saying.
[251:44.32]Just wanted to let you know.
[251:45.02]If you do that, you're gonna get banned for life.
[251:46.40]They're gonna ban you for life.
[251:48.34]They're gonna ban you for life.
[251:49.78]And then you're never gonna be able to come back.
[252:01.74]Alright, alright, moving on, moving on, moving on.
[252:09.00]SNK, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[252:14.00]Goddamnit.
[252:16.00]Thanks for the 10 subs SNK, I really appreciate it.
[252:21.00]Lonely animator, thanks for the 1000 bits.
[252:23.00]Is this turning into another The Thing money stream again?
[252:28.92]There was a lot today. There was a lot today.
[252:32.92]Staff is here? Good! Good! I hope they're here! I hope they're here!
[252:37.92]It was THEM! It was these guys! These people right here. I didn't do anything.
[252:42.92]I have been saying since the stream started: no, don't do that, it's not okay. It was them! It was all them, I didn't do anything.
[252:50.92]Why- why are you cuffing me? I didn't do anything. What? Hey!
[252:56.92]He's snitching. I'm-
[253:03.03]But I didn't- no! I was very adamant saying: don't do this shit.
[253:08.13]It's not all right.
[253:09.39]And that's what I said.
[253:10.19]I made my statement and I made sure that I said it to you and all of you.
[253:13.69]You told you what was going to happen.
[253:15.31]I told you it was going to happen.
[253:16.55]This is like when your mother told you, wear a fucking helmet on your bike.
[253:19.85]If you fall down on your bike, you're going to get hurt.
[253:21.97]And you fell down.
[253:22.65]You didn't have shin pads on.
[253:23.73]You scraped up your whole fucking knee and you came home crying.
[253:26.74]Wear your shin pads.
[253:29.10]I told you.
[253:35.90]Anyways, uh, Goikee gave a shitload of money that I missed.
[253:41.14]Uh, it was 5,000 bits, $50.
[253:42.70]50 bucks, I missed it.
[253:47.51]Is this the guy who beat a shoe on stream with E-A-T in brackets?
[253:54.73]The House Flipper update is real.
[253:55.89]All right.
[253:59.99]Because you ate a shoe.
[254:02.29]I ate a fucking shoe.
[254:04.90]It turned everybody up to a million.
[254:12.04]I ate a shoe on stream and it made people start streaming movies.
[254:15.92]Do you understand how fucked up that is?
[254:27.93]Alright.
[254:28.91]Let's keep going.
[254:35.42]There's so much ripple effect.
[254:38.25]This guy's eating a fucking shoe.
[254:39.97]He's eating a shoe on stream.
[254:41.15]Holy fuck.
[254:42.47]Oh, fuck.
[254:42.83]I gotta... I gotta lash out somewhere.
[254:45.55]Oh, I'm far.
[254:46.96]He just ate a whole shoe.
[254:48.36]All right.
[254:49.62]Let's stream movies.
[254:56.51]Scream.
[254:56.81]I gotta scream at him.
[254:57.77]Scream in his face.
[255:02.73]I gotta lash out at him.
[255:04.18]I gotta lash out.
[255:04.76]No, fuck the scorpion game.
[255:05.88]No, no, no, fuck this guy.
[255:10.92]Where's the other shoe?
[255:12.31]You're wondering.
[255:14.37]I didn't have to eat two shoes.
[255:16.29]Because Sans is a fucking Mii costume.
[255:20.32]That was part of the rule.
[255:21.60]That was part of the game.
[255:43.70]Why do you even... Twitch chat is... Twitch staff is... Were you here for the shoe eating?
[255:50.56]Hey Windar, thanks for the $5.
[256:01.13]Hey German, loving the content.
[256:02.51]That shoe looked like shit.
[256:05.07]I just want to say, fuck you, but in the nicest way possible.
[256:11.33]The fuck is going on today?
[256:12.95]I'm doing it right now.
[256:14.89]I can't stop.
[256:37.85]Dragon, bro.
[256:40.37]I ain't ever taken more than like five days off ever again.
[256:46.22]It's like there's a clog in the drain.
[256:48.92]And then you, like, there's so much water pressure behind this clog.
[256:52.50]Well, it's like, the clog's been there for six or seven days.
[256:55.57]Like, when I undo the clog, I just get sprayed in the face with water.
[256:59.45]Like, the water just sprays everywhere.
[257:00.85]It's just, it's flushed.
[257:09.66]This is a germa-torture stream.
[257:11.52]No, I think it's fucking- I think it's- Oh, shit, I can't- I'm gonna say the thing.
[257:16.48]No, I think it's funny, but- Ah, yeah, I think it's funny, right?
[257:23.48]The thing that everybody fucking says.
[257:26.38]Oh, no, no, no, this person, you don't think that's funny at all.
[257:28.16]You're actually annoyed by that.
[257:30.20]No, I mean, I think it's funny, but you really shouldn't be doing that.
[257:34.06]Oh, fuck.
[257:45.26]He's melting down.
[257:51.12]Frack.
[257:56.83]What?
[257:57.03]What happened?
[257:58.09]It's not even Mei?
[257:59.41]What's wrong with Mei?
[258:00.59]What?
[258:01.03]Who's he talking to?
[258:01.67]What's going on?
[258:02.83]You guys are freaking me out.
[258:07.58]Watch WWE and then ban me for life.
[258:11.32]Fine.
[258:12.66]Write that name down.
[258:16.06]I will watch my favorite old moments from WWE at some point soon.
[258:21.02]And then we're going to ban that person for life.
[258:30.62]Uh, Shark.
[258:31.86]Sharko Supreme.
[258:32.90]Thanks for the 1500 bits.
[258:36.01]$15.
[258:36.03]Simpsons hit and run broke his fucking spine.
[258:42.31]No, it's too long in a chair.
[258:45.65]Ugh.
[258:49.44]I was having problems way before Simpsons Hit and Run.
[258:52.06]Was I?
[258:54.40]Where was... Was Simpsons Hit and Run in Vegas?
[258:58.14]Simpsons Hit and Run was in Vegas.
[259:00.16]Yeah, I was having... Yeah, it was.
[259:02.06]I was having problems before that.
[259:04.42]Yeah.
[259:05.13]No.
[259:05.65]I was having problems before I moved to Vegas.
[259:07.73]That's when it started.
[259:12.77]But... Unfortunately, there's gonna have to be no more of those.
[259:18.20]There's going to have to be no more of those 10 plus hour streams.
[259:22.66]So we can put in the history books.
[259:25.51]The longest stream ever is going to be that Lord of the Rings, the Two Towers stream.
[259:32.99]It's going to be 13 and a half hours.
[259:35.62]That's going to be the number one most streamed time ever in one stream.
[259:39.84]It's never going to get past.
[259:42.10]I don't think that'll ever happen.
[259:47.41]Hey, Gooberry Juice, thanks for the $7.50.
[259:48.93]Hey, ShoeChewer985, I'm still amazed you actually did the shoe bit.
[259:53.73]I'm also so sorry we missed your birthday last Wednesday.
[259:57.53]Nonetheless, happy birthday.
[259:59.07]Hopefully you can keep making amazing streams like this one.
[260:01.05]Love you, dude.
[260:01.55]Where's this birthday thing coming from?
[260:03.26]What's the birthday thing?
[260:09.18]I feel like I'm on a different planet today.
[260:20.88]Okay, I... You're just, you're fucking gonna be gone.
[260:26.72]Like, that's just not... What the fuck do you want me to say to that?
[260:31.39]That's wicked fucked up.
[260:35.01]What's the correct response to that image?
[260:40.98]What should I say there?
[260:42.06]Ooh, cool.
[260:44.20]Nice.
[260:45.72]Ooh...
[260:49.64]I'm into that.
[260:51.60]No.
[260:53.48]Can I stop?
[260:56.68]Thank you goo berry juice for the 420.
[260:58.28]They say nice.
[260:59.14]Nice.
[261:03.88]Thank you tits on fire for the 10 subs.
[261:05.70]We got it earlier, I think.
[261:07.52]Lonely animator again.
[261:09.08]No, no, that's why it's pop up twice.
[261:11.55]Looks like another The Thing money stream to me.
[261:13.27]No, no, this is different.
[261:16.98]Yeah.
[261:17.94]No, this is the same.
[261:19.92]No, it's not.
[261:20.76]The first one was $10,000.
[261:22.38]Lonely Animator gave $10,000.
[261:23.36]No, no, $1,000 and then $1,500.
[261:24.54]Okay, I don't know why they popped up strangely.
[261:29.92]Thanks for the $15.
[261:31.36]Looks like it is another The Thing money stream.
[261:35.03]Sometimes you guys just smoke crack and give me $5,000.
[261:38.59]That does happen.
[261:46.23]And it's fucking crazy.
[261:53.41]The thing stream was god tier.
[261:56.13]That game was so hard.
[261:59.49]Fuck that game, man.
[262:00.91]Those bosses and shit.
[262:02.49]I mean, I loved that game in like a jokey kind of way.
[262:06.66]But some of those bosses were so stupid.
[262:08.94]It was just so bad.
[262:11.92]I loved it for the wrong reasons.
[262:18.72]The thing face, yeah, that did happen there, too.
[262:27.32]Thanks for playing this, I don't have to.
[262:28.56]You're welcome.
[262:30.60]Autumn Dragons, thanks for the $2.50.
[262:31.94]Hey, German, glad to have you back.
[262:33.46]Tarantulas are normally very docile, even in the wild, and rely shooting out the irritating hairs they have instead.
[262:41.81]They aren't exactly great animals for petting, but they're still very shy and cute.
[262:46.39]Don't you all agree, chat?
[262:48.49]Yeah, I would let a tarantula crawl in my mouth.
[262:49.95]I already said it.
[262:51.25]Yeah.
[262:56.36]That wouldn't bother me.
[262:59.96]Now, if you put me in the same room with a general small house spider, I refuse to go in the room until somebody else takes care of it.
[263:09.31]It's funny how that works, really.
[263:12.27]Uh, thank you, Afro Mancer, for the 1500 bits.
[263:16.91]Cheers to you, Jerma.
[263:17.73]Thank you for the years of laughter and for easily being the best streamer on Twitch.
[263:20.93]I appreciate that.
[263:21.81]Thank you.
[263:22.85]You deserve it.
[263:23.82]Your pal, Ethan.
[263:25.42]Thank you.
[263:30.70]Thanks for the 1,500 bits and thanks for the incredibly kind message.
[263:33.14]I appreciate it.
[263:35.52]Large27x, thanks for the 1,000 bits.
[263:38.77]Jerma, do the funny.
[263:41.47]After you read that, I assume you did the funny, so thanks.
[263:50.85]We talked about this earlier.
[263:52.07]I don't even know what that means.
[263:57.93]I'm gonna do something funny.
[263:59.93]Oh, okay.
[264:01.19]How?
[264:01.97]What do I do?
[264:03.75]How do I do that?
[264:05.15]What buttons do I press?
[264:07.65]How do I press the right button to make the funny thing happen?
[264:18.24]Say the line.
[264:20.62]Um... Ratch?
[264:30.01]Where's a Ratch?
[264:30.69]Did it work?
[264:38.29]It works every time.
[264:41.07]Hey Topac, thanks for the $2.50.
[264:42.09]I hope you're staying safe during these times.
[264:43.75]I was quite intrigued with the products you had on your Amazon Marketplace the other day.
[264:47.08]Glad you're providing means for some people to stay indoors.
[264:50.02]What?
[264:58.83]What?
[264:59.25]Okay.
[265:01.53]Why does that exist?
[265:02.27]I don't even know what that... Okay, thanks for the $2.50.
[265:12.20]Uh, Shibir... Shibir... Shibir... Shibir... I think I said that right, hopefully.
[265:19.74]Thanks for the free box.
[265:21.92]Here's to you, clown.
[265:23.32]Known about you since Rat Movie, but only really started watching on and off since the Sam and Max streams.
[265:28.41]Just started going through the archive recently because of this COVID lockdown.
[265:31.93]And your brand of insanity has helped me keep me sane during these trying times.
[265:35.83]Anyway, here's a few chocolate coins from a newish loyal viewer.
[265:39.61]Hope you and everyone stay safe.
[265:41.09]You as well.
[265:43.99]And that goes for all of you.
[265:49.51]Thank you for 300 bits and welcome to, um, maybe being a regular viewer, maybe.
[265:55.67]Glad to have you.
[266:01.11]Gooberry Juice, thanks for the $3.16 3.16.
[266:05.36]Show the Vince Walker.
[266:07.08]Is there a GIF?
[266:08.34]Everybody's seen the Vince Walker, so I can't at this point.
[266:20.56]I feel like the Vince walk is... We've all seen the GIF so many times that you don't even need to click an image.
[266:28.57]You just... It's up there.
[266:30.33]There it is.
[266:31.03]I see it.
[266:31.83]I showed it.
[266:33.53]Like, I showed it already.
[266:35.01]You know what I mean?
[266:36.09]Like, you thought it, so you saw it.
[266:37.83]Because everyone's seen it a million times.
[266:42.26]I don't know what this is.
[266:51.29]You guys can't automatically assume that just because something says the word Germa on it that I know what it is.
[266:57.89]Judging by the, like, 400 Redbubble merchandise pieces that are on there.
[267:12.70]Gnarly, thanks to the 250, when will Glue Man stun the entire Albertson family?
[267:16.34]Heh heh heh.
[267:20.87]Maybe someday soon.
[267:23.51]Large27x, thanks for the thousand bits.
[267:25.47]Do the walk.
[267:26.09]I believe I did when you asked me to.
[267:30.49]SirK9, thanks for the 250.
[267:31.79]Still in Spider Londo Mega Lull.
[267:35.38]The game's good.
[267:36.44]The game's good.
[267:39.36]SirK9 again, thanks for the 250.
[267:41.90]Also, I'm fucking appalled that you didn't instantly put Whoppers into the trash tier on the candy tier list.
[267:47.26]They're literally the equivalent of chocolate-coated chalk balls.
[267:51.43]Um, they're okay.
[267:54.71]I like that crunchy, gritty kind of texture to them sometimes.
[267:58.64]It depends on if you feel like it.
[267:59.54]They're okay.
[268:02.06]I wouldn't order them.
[268:03.44]But if they were in a candy dish and I was awkwardly talking to some friends or something that I haven't seen in a long time, I would just keep eating them to make it so I had something for my mouth to do besides talk.
[268:14.71]So I could just listen forever.
[268:16.87]And I'm eating your entire fucking bowl of chocolate to make sure that I can't really speak.
[268:23.51]And I can nod and be like, mm, mm, like, like very, very clearly.
[268:26.44]Like, mm, mm, mm-hmm.
[268:27.88]Yeah, I mean, you know, I'm, you see, mm-hmm, I'm eating.
[268:33.38]That whole bowl will be gone.
[268:37.99]Uh, OG Don, uh, OG John Dude, thanks for the 500 bits.
[268:41.65]Love you, Jerma.
[268:42.23]Glad to see you having a good time.
[268:43.32]I am always having a good time.
[268:49.41]Eh, that's not exactly, that's the line.
[268:51.55]Maybe like 98.9% of the time.
[268:56.19]Sometimes I don't have fun in a video game, and I get angry at it for a minute.
[269:02.83]That's only like 1%.
[269:04.84]No, that's like 0.2%.
[269:06.02]And 98.5%.
[269:09.48]Yeah, that's right.
[269:13.56]Although I did yell at somebody today and called him a 16-year-old, didn't I?
[269:16.74]I did that today.
[269:19.79]But I wasn't mad though, that was me trying to make like a- like a- like a- like an edgy joke.
[269:24.17]Right?
[269:25.95]It's 17.
[269:31.01]It was 17.
[269:32.14]And it was me.
[269:34.04]And I am 17.
[269:36.52]He's so edgy.
[269:44.14]Today was a wild one.
[269:45.36]Today was a wild fucking stream.
[269:49.92]You're a fucking bully.
[269:51.94]No, we already went over it.
[269:53.20]Okay, if you're like holding a bunch of groceries, and you take the time to like peer over and like scream at me while I drive by and be like, stupid idiot, and you drop like the milk out of your grocery bag, that's not my fault.
[270:12.87]Wait, does that make any sense for this context?
[270:14.35]No, no, no, no, no, no, that doesn't make sense.
[270:17.13]Does it?
[270:17.47]No.
[270:19.40]If you have bagged groceries and you're like fucking screaming at me, you stupid dumb idiot guy.
[270:23.60]I walk by you on the street and you drop all your groceries.
[270:26.45]No, no.
[270:27.05]Yeah, that makes sense.
[270:28.47]I didn't do that.
[270:30.59]No, I turned.
[270:31.07]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[270:32.61]I got it.
[270:32.89]I got it.
[270:33.09]I got it.
[270:33.71]Just wait.
[270:34.83]We're walking down the street.
[270:36.12]You're coming towards me and I'm coming towards you.
[270:38.08]You have groceries.
[270:38.86]I don't.
[270:40.17]So, I've got a camera in front of me, and I'm FaceTiming my grandmother or something.
[270:46.23]And all of a sudden, when we walk by, you just go, Shut up, stupid idiot!
[270:50.81]You stupid, dumb, fucking moron!
[270:53.39]And I go, I'm like, what the fuck was that?
[270:55.52]And I turn, and I'm like, hold on a second, Grandma.
[270:57.44]Hey!
[270:58.26]And you turn startled, and you drop all your groceries.
[271:00.86]Oh, yeah!
[271:04.14]Oh, what did you just do to me?
[271:06.02]You asshole!
[271:08.20]Is this real?
[271:09.10]That works, right?
[271:12.28]That would not be my fault.
[271:14.47]No, it wouldn't.
[271:15.21]No, I would be responding to you.
[271:17.15]I'd be like, hey, what did you say?
[271:18.29]And you'd be like, what, you didn't think I was going to respond back?
[271:23.38]Long story short, double bag.
[271:28.81]Don't carry more than you can fucking hold.
[271:30.89]Don't be, uh, don't be one of those, don't be one of those fucking people.
[271:34.68]I have to take it all in in one trip from the car.
[271:37.62]I've got to do, like, a full clothing rack on my right arm and an entire suit rack on my left arm.
[271:44.18]And then I walk in.
[271:45.16]It's turning into, like, a stand-up routine.
[271:46.78]All right, let's go.
[271:47.45]I'm done.
[271:47.79]Thank you, Tara Alacrin, for the $2.50.
[271:56.94]Jeremy, I just saw the clips from the beginning of the stream.
[271:58.70]If I did that on stage, at an open mic.
[272:01.40]Remember when we were gonna do that?
[272:03.10]That's still on the table, by the way.
[272:06.06]Is for me to stream me at an open mic night.
[272:09.29]And just try to do, like, comedy.
[272:17.13]And just do shit like that.
[272:19.14]And see what happens.
[272:20.46]He's gonna bomb so fucking hard.
[272:27.23]You'll see it live if it happens.
[272:33.09]Please don't do it.
[272:39.00]Why?
[272:39.96]What's the concern?
[272:42.58]Should I get introduced as the funniest man in the world?
[272:45.68]That's a good idea.
[272:48.56]Now introducing... Jeremy, the funniest man in the world, Elbertson.
[272:54.57]Ha ha ha!
[272:59.72]Automatically, people would be so mad.
[273:02.98]Like, shut the fuck up.
[273:04.46]Like, that's so funny.
[273:07.64]Okay.
[273:08.60]Go on.
[273:09.40]Do your fucking thing.
[273:19.43]Anyways.
[273:20.93]We had five community subs from Fwinch.
[273:24.23]What do you say we show the community subs right now on stream?
[273:29.02]and the regular subs and the subs from today all the subs all of them I'm gonna show them all right now thanks again guys as always let's no no no no no no excuse me that was going real fast holy shit how many subs today
[273:58.98]Okay, that... Okay.
[274:00.62]Um... That's four... There was like 450 subs today.
[274:05.58]Holy shit.
[274:10.08]This is in three and a half... Four and a half hours.
[274:14.32]You guys spoil the fuck out of me.
[274:17.88]I gotta eat more shoes.
[274:27.15]Thanks a lot, though.
[274:31.74]Really appreciate it.
[274:35.04]And right here at the end, Wingman1.
[274:37.74]Five community subs.
[274:38.56]Thanks, Wingman.
[274:41.11]Thank you.
[274:48.39]And Wingman won.
[274:50.25]Gave five dollars earlier as well.
[274:52.01]When I was in summer camp in 2010, I felt something crawling on my face in the middle of the night.
[274:56.46]I picked it up and tossed it over the bunk.
[274:58.94]I still don't know what it was.
[275:00.90]Well the terrifying thing about what you're saying here is it was big enough for you to grab with your hand.
[275:07.45]If it was big enough for you to hold in your hand and throw, that's terrifying.
[275:24.64]I think everyone's had a scenario like that play out potentially in their life.
[275:28.16]Where you just don't know what it was, and it could be anything.
[275:31.43]And then you just never know, and never knowing is awful.
[275:34.91]Because what the hell was it?
[275:36.33]And could it be possible that that could happen again?
[275:44.06]It actually happens not super frequently, but not infrequently enough where you don't realize it's happening.
[275:50.15]How many times do you feel just something like touch your arm or like your leg or something when you're lying down in bed?
[275:54.93]And it's just like rip, toss, throw as fucking hard as I can in that in left direction.
[276:01.62]And you just have no idea and you'll never know.
[276:05.64]It could have been a piece of hair and you'll never know.
[276:15.98]An anonymous cheerer, thanks for $5, 500 bits, just 500 bits.
[276:20.00]Dropping them right here, thank you.
[276:21.58]Reaper, thanks for $2.50.
[276:22.40]Hey, since the Rumble is until September because of COVID-19, can we maybe get a sneak peek event advertising the Rumble?
[276:29.47]It's been too long since we've seen our friends from the ring.
[276:34.99]Um, yeah.
[276:36.61]Yeah.
[276:40.96]The plan is...
[276:43.97]This is the plan.
[276:45.67]A rumble and a few matches will happen in September before the marathon.
[276:53.52]But probably going to do a small card of kind of pre-matches with no rumbles.
[277:10.95]So instead of having the big main event being the 30-person Rumble and it's like an hour, we'll just do some matches with some new characters.
[277:20.04]And the Rumble will be in September.
[277:21.46]So maybe like a few weeks leading up to the Rumble, we'll do that.
[277:28.18]Or maybe we won't.
[277:29.12]And maybe I'll just save everything and just have a huge event because that Rumble is going to be for charity.
[277:35.21]That's going to be a charity stream.
[277:36.31]For those of you that don't know,
[277:42.33]All the money that's going to come through that stream is going to be directly given to Sherry.
[277:46.49]There's going to be a direct link.
[277:50.15]It'll be tracked.
[277:51.41]It'll be easy.
[277:54.49]We'll have all that set up.
[277:55.87]So it's just completely just transparent and there it is and open.
[278:02.16]So it might be better to have it all be one big, you know, three, four, five hour event rather than one small one.
[278:07.58]That would be much better, I think.
[278:15.64]We'll see.
[278:15.86]But that's the plan.
[278:23.12]Still scheduled for September.
[278:24.40]Not sure what we want to do before it.
[278:27.64]Hey, Demonic Cucumber, thanks for 250.
[278:28.98]I haven't given any bits in a while because I've missed a lot of streams from my new sleep schedule.
[278:33.35]Didn't really know what to say when I did.
[278:36.17]Thank you for all the entertainment and being an actual inspiration.
[278:38.31]Sorry that chat got kind of rowdy today, but I did like this game a lot, and you're only halfway through it.
[278:45.06]I'd love to see you play the other chapters another day.
[278:47.86]Lots of German love to you.
[278:52.36]I thought chat was alright until they started streaming their favorite video games at me, and, um, please click on the guy that's streaming seven movies at the same time and get your channel banned.
[279:05.33]That's when I had to draw the line.
[279:07.03]That's where I had to draw the line.
[279:08.27]You told us to.
[279:09.95]No, I... I was reacting to... I was pretending to be you.
[279:16.76]That's why I was doing like the, oh, hey, let's do this.
[279:20.96]He still isn't banned.
[279:21.98]That's fucking crazy.
[279:22.88]I don't know how that's possible.
[279:31.11]I love a Mari RPG.
[279:42.75]What the fuck?
[279:44.28]What the fuck?
[279:47.18]No!
[279:53.25]Anyways.
[279:54.99]Thank you, TransScout, for the 500 bits.
[279:56.55]Jeremiah, I struggle with eye contact, too.
[279:58.99]It was oddly comforting to hear that my favorite streamer is also not great at constant eye contact.
[280:03.73]Thanks for the weird brain representation.
[280:06.03]Also, don't forget about the tarantula mouth stream.
[280:08.77]I will.
[280:12.25]I'm just all over the place.
[280:14.08]The thing is, I talk out in so many different directions that nobody fucking cares or knows or notices.
[280:22.73]Like, I go, bang, over here, eye contact, bang, at the wall, bang, looking at my phone, bang, in your eyes again.
[280:27.20]Over here, what's that?
[280:28.22]There's a light over there.
[280:29.16]My eyes are that way.
[280:30.06]I'm talking with my hands.
[280:30.84]My hands are moving and flashing my palms up.
[280:34.16]Over that way, right in your eyes, eye contact again, right?
[280:36.27]Like, I'm just so all over the place that people are just like, oh, that's what he does.
[280:40.15]So that's good.
[280:46.22]He's got laser eyes.
[280:47.24]Hey Wolfgang, thanks for the 500 bits.
[280:49.68]I donated $10 since you didn't watch WWE on stream.
[280:57.09]Wait, what?
[280:58.29]I did though.
[281:04.79]Oop, laser eyes.
[281:08.98]rtx 420 69 ti great name I say it every time 250 term a while back you said you wanted a pet reptile of some kind have your feelings changed do you have an update for us
[281:21.87]I was looking around for something that would be something I really want to take care of, but the move has been a lot more complicated because of all the coronavirus stuff.
[281:33.28]So it hasn't really been a simple process to kind of move and get everything done and situated and that's it.
[281:40.58]So that's kind of been put on the back burner for a while until things sort of settle down.
[281:51.20]And decide if that's something that I actually really want to do.
[281:53.51]I do, though.
[281:57.97]What was that pinball that was Odama?
[282:01.57]Odama.
[282:03.47]Dubski dude, thanks for 250.
[282:05.97]German, just wanted to recommend you a game called Rain World.
[282:08.33]It's really difficult and has beautiful pixel art visuals.
[282:11.37]Plays a little like Jump King.
[282:12.45]I think you'd love it.
[282:13.07]Just don't play it for only one hour and then ditch it for boomer games like Viva Piñata.
[282:16.86]Haha, but we know you'd never do that.
[282:18.58]Haha, you know what I mean.
[282:19.70]Haha, where's my rain train boys at?
[282:22.56]Choo choo.
[282:29.05]Hold on a second here.
[282:32.01]You want to talk about the bully?
[282:33.59]I was bullied into playing Rain World.
[282:36.97]Remember I was doing something else and it was just like this constant spam of play Rain World?
[282:41.33]That wasn't my choice.
[282:44.11]I did that because people were screaming at me.
[282:47.39]I didn't go, hey guys, today we're going to play Rain World.
[282:51.30]I was doing something else and it was just a sea of rain train crew members.
[282:59.74]That wasn't my first choice.
[283:02.08]And I played it and I thought it was interesting.
[283:03.70]I thought it was cool.
[283:04.43]And I just stamped a fucking veto on it.
[283:08.03]Oh god damn it.
[283:12.29]This thing is always gonna fall down.
[283:14.51]This thing will fall down every single time.
[283:17.22]I have to like... I'm gonna like drill this to the top of the monitor.
[283:29.33]O-T-T-O.
[283:30.13]He's breaking everything.
[283:31.25]It's a Wii sensor bar.
[283:32.21]You can use two candles.
[283:33.19]It'll do the same thing.
[283:35.19]True?
[283:35.51]That's actually true.
[283:36.21]Actually, no, that's true.
[283:37.07]True.
[283:37.33]That's actually... Wow.
[283:39.28]No, he's right.
[283:39.86]He's right.
[283:40.44]He's right.
[283:41.00]He's actually right.
[283:41.74]L-U-L.
[283:42.58]That's correct.
[283:43.32]Actually correct.
[283:45.10]I know.
[283:45.50]I know.
[283:48.14]Hey, Razzle.
[283:48.76]Thanks for the $2.50.
[283:49.28]It's my birthday tomorrow.
[283:50.38]It's my birthday tomorrow.
[283:51.18]It's my birthday tomorrow.
[283:51.98]It's my birthday tomorrow.
[283:53.33]It's my birthday tomorrow.
[283:54.23]It's my birthday tomorrow.
[283:55.13]Okay, happy birthday.
[283:59.09]Razzle250 again, can I cast a curse on you?
[284:02.05]I'm not gonna read this out loud.
[284:03.68]No, don't do that.
[284:05.08]Somebody remove it.
[284:06.94]I don't want any curses.
[284:09.91]No more curses.
[284:10.45]I'm not gonna read that out loud.
[284:11.43]I don't know what the fuck that is.
[284:13.90]No curses.
[284:14.70]Somebody de-curse me?
[284:16.28]Can somebody... There's got to be somebody in here.
[284:18.02]There's 3,200 people watching right fucking now.
[284:20.50]One of you.
[284:21.52]One of you has to be kind of into this shit.
[284:23.77]Right?
[284:24.03]Like, one of you is going to be into this shit.
[284:25.65]Like, the whole cursing and, like, witchcraft.
[284:28.57]Just take it off now.
[284:29.33]Take it off.
[284:29.63]I know one of you does.
[284:30.71]Seriously, please.
[284:31.27]I know you will.
[284:32.19]Somebody's going to listen to this and be like...
[284:34.25]Oh, actually, I am into that.
[284:35.51]That's like, I'm into like kind of the energies and like the earth and spells and shit.
[284:40.84]Just do it.
[284:41.54]Please take, remove the curses from me.
[284:43.42]There's like six of them on me right now.
[284:45.10]And like people keep doing them to me.
[284:47.58]Take them off.
[284:48.29]Just take them off.
[284:48.91]Take them off.
[284:51.31]Take the curse off.
[284:52.71]Somebody in this chat is going to do it.
[284:54.49]I'm going to be so happy when you do.
[285:01.32]All I can do is make your penis smaller.
[285:05.96]Don't!
[285:06.60]Don't do that either!
[285:08.07]Don't do that one!
[285:09.23]If I wake up tomorrow, and it's- I will be so mad!
[285:13.49]Don't do that!
[285:14.93]Use a different one!
[285:16.47]Use- Okay, no, no!
[285:17.89]Use, like, every time I, like, eat a tomato, I fucking cry or something.
[285:21.43]I'd rather have that, please!
[285:23.06]No!
[285:23.52]No!
[285:23.86]Alright, I gotta go.
[285:24.62]Hey, Wingman, thanks for the five subs, we already got you.
[285:32.56]Don't curse me.
[285:33.65]Everyone's gonna do the small penis curse to me.
[285:38.27]It's gonna be gone tomorrow.
[285:52.32]Can you fucking imagine like in the mirror in your house and you're doing like an incantation to make a streamer on the internet's penis smaller?
[286:04.54]Can you imagine doing that and like going to sleep in your bed?
[286:17.35]That was a good day.
[286:19.47]I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.
[286:22.85]Alright, so half of you are going to do it.
[286:24.25]Half of you make sure you do the one that makes it bigger.
[286:27.56]Okay.
[286:27.82]I'm going to address you directly now.
[286:31.70]I'm going to address you directly.
[286:36.68]Um, it's... It's been like a week.
[286:45.70]And I've only streamed like three or four times in the last like 16 days or something.
[286:52.51]we're shaking off the cobwebs a little bit here we're getting back into the swing of things and sometimes a streamer hasn't been streaming for a while and he says things like half of you do a curse on me to make my penis smaller and half of you do one to make it bigger sometimes that happens when you haven't streamed in a while and I just want to apologize um for uh the sort of uh under construction that we have here you know what I mean
[287:22.17]I apologize.
[287:25.37]The balance must remain.
[287:29.83]Why would you want some people to do it smaller?
[287:32.01]No, I don't.
[287:32.83]Did I?
[287:33.67]No.
[287:34.91]No, I was saying, like, if that's gonna happen, then I need you guys to do the other.
[287:39.68]Just take them off.
[287:40.52]Alright, I'm done.
[287:41.44]Goodbye.
[287:42.32]See you tomorrow.
[287:42.82]No, I'm not even streaming tomorrow.
[287:44.00]I'm streaming on Wednesday.
[287:44.78]Alright, it's been a while.
[287:46.12]I forgot how to stream.
[287:47.68]We're not even done with bits.
[287:52.09]This is not even the right screen.
[287:55.65]The music's not even playing.
[287:56.84]Yes, it is.
[287:59.80]Hey, Kooskoos, thanks for the $2.50.
[288:00.96]Hi, you're my first livestream.
[288:02.22]I've been watching you since TF2.
[288:03.48]You're the reason I have a Twitch account.
[288:05.64]This is even better than the second channel on YouTube.
[288:08.23]Hey, thanks.
[288:09.41]I think they both work very good together.
[288:10.83]I think they both work hand-in-hand.
[288:12.21]It's like chocolate and peanut butter.
[288:14.43]Combine them together.
[288:15.48]Mmm.
[288:16.46]Only eat the eggs though, or the trees.
[288:19.04]You're getting ripped off.
[288:20.44]Regular Reese's suck.
[288:21.84]Get the trees or get the eggs because you don't- you get way more chocolate cream.
[288:25.90]You don't get that like gross ridge bullshit.
[288:35.27]But thank you.
[288:37.89]Hey Skunkos!
[288:38.89]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[288:40.07]Also love from Boston.
[288:41.23]It's nice to watch your streams being holed up in my room.
[288:45.25]Stay safe.
[288:49.35]He's so cracked it's not even funny.
[288:52.49]What, you guys never had Reese's eggs?
[288:54.35]Or Reese's trees before?
[288:57.20]The holiday ones.
[288:59.04]The regular Reese's have the ridge of chocolate and then the center is peanut butter.
[289:04.42]You guys have never had a Reese's tree before?
[289:06.14]Or a Reese's egg?
[289:07.98]What?
[289:08.10]I'm...
[289:15.49]No, no, you've never had a Reese's Tree.
[289:18.69]For Christmas.
[289:21.59]Like the holiday ones.
[289:22.45]For Easter and eggs and... How come every time I say something that sounds so normal, everyone looks at me like I've got fucking 12 heads?
[289:34.89]The eggs and Christmas trees slaps.
[289:36.63]Yeah, I know.
[289:37.27]I'm... I'm... what?
[289:46.42]You aren't normal.
[289:49.34]I'm very normal.
[289:52.02]I was about to turn the webcam on and be like, would somebody normal do this?
[289:54.88]And I was going to put my fingers in my eyes and scream and shit.
[290:03.13]Hey, Red Ranger, thanks for the 1400 bits.
[290:04.89]Hope all is well with you.
[290:06.43]I highly recommend pet reptiles.
[290:09.65]I have worked with them for a few years now, and they can be amazing to keep.
[290:12.57]Good luck with the move.
[290:15.79]Yeah, bearded dragons are awesome.
[290:18.55]They're super fun.
[290:19.51]They're really chill.
[290:21.97]Or a crested gecko was another one.
[290:25.79]It just seemed like you can just kind of hang out with them.
[290:30.05]Give them a bunch of cool stuff for them to hang out with in their tank or whatever.
[290:37.58]This is a Clint's reptile shill.
[290:39.64]Yes, I've seen every single one of his videos.
[290:42.58]You don't think I would be a consumer of Clint's reptiles?
[290:49.91]Crested Gecko is a 4.6 out of 5.
[290:51.01]That's from Clint.
[290:51.53]My bits are a decursing spell, by the way.
[290:59.95]Thank you.
[291:00.31]Thank you.
[291:18.88]Hey, Eggscramble, thanks for the 500 bits.
[291:20.18]Hey, Trevor, great stream.
[291:21.24]I was very cozy drinking coffee listening to you.
[291:23.82]It made me happy.
[291:24.52]Love you in chat.
[291:25.44]Sleep well tonight, guys.
[291:27.70]Hey, that's a... That's a wicked nice... Just really good, nice comment.
[291:32.79]To everybody.
[291:37.13]Your penis is... Oh!
[291:38.71]Stop!
[291:39.09]Why didn't I even read it?
[291:47.75]I started to.
[291:48.95]I just saw the P word and I had to start reading it.
[291:59.60]It came true.
[292:00.82]I would never tell you guys if it came true.
[292:05.25]What am I, what do we start the stream on Wednesday?
[292:07.07]Hey guys, uh, penis shrink.
[292:10.11]Just in case anybody wanted to know.
[292:12.49]It worked.
[292:14.61]I'm not going to open the stream with that.
[292:22.99]Hey Wolfgang, thanks for 500 bits.
[292:25.33]Now I have to explain myself.
[292:26.97]I was going to donate $50, but you didn't watch Classic WWE later on in the stream.
[292:34.34]So I had to donate only $10.
[292:36.48]If you watch Classic Attitude Era WWE for a stream, I would be very happy.
[292:41.56]I plan on it.
[292:43.82]I plan on watching... Well, maybe not whole episodes of Raw.
[292:48.36]I don't think I can do that.
[292:49.95]But some of my favorite moments.
[292:51.91]Some of the best stuns.
[292:56.31]Like, for instance, I can give you a moment right now.
[292:58.42]One of my favorite moments of WWE, WWF is what it was back when I was watching.
[293:04.32]I'll give you top two, top five.
[293:06.08]No, it's probably top ten moment.
[293:08.38]Ken Shamrock being in an iron cage and Chris Jericho walking around taunting Ken Shamrock.
[293:14.66]And by the way, Ken Shamrock was an animal person back in the old WWE.
[293:19.51]He didn't like talk.
[293:20.77]He just screamed and was like stronger than 500 people at the same time.
[293:24.71]During this bit, Ken Shamrock grabs both his hands onto the bars, these iron bars, and Hulk pulls the fucking cage open.
[293:36.27]I forget how he gets in the cage, but Chris Jericho, like, trapped him in the cage or something.
[293:40.80]And he gets out.
[293:41.72]He screams and bends the iron bars to get out like fucking Superman and attacks Chris Jericho and, like, beats him up.
[293:48.30]It's hysterical.
[293:58.65]Don't forget to ban me before it.
[294:00.73]Why do people want to get banned?
[294:07.16]Is this like the hot dog bear thing where it didn't actually happen?
[294:09.70]No, no, no.
[294:10.10]This actually happened.
[294:12.36]He's in this weird, like, rascally wabbit cage that Elmer Fudd would make for Bugs Bunny.
[294:20.32]And he just pulls the bars open and gets out.
[294:22.87]It happens.
[294:26.53]It happens.
[294:29.45]But we'll do that at some point.
[294:30.57]Thank you, Stripes Beast for the 300 bits.
[294:35.38]I don't want to read this.
[294:37.28]I can't remove the curse for myself.
[294:39.40]That's not how it works.
[294:40.10]I don't know anything about witchcraft.
[294:42.92]Me saying that out loud is the equivalent of me being the fucking idiot that reads the inside of the Necronomicon.
[294:50.29]I'm not going to do that.
[294:50.93]I don't know anything about this.
[294:56.97]For all I know, that could be a shrinking solution.
[295:02.66]You don't know how curses work, do you?
[295:04.74]No, I don't.
[295:05.62]Why would I know how curses work?
[295:08.77]I went to school for radio, and I stream video games.
[295:13.51]Why would I know how curses work?
[295:18.61]I went to, like, film and radio school.
[295:21.62]They didn't teach, uh, there was no, sorry guys, there was no defense against the dark arts at the school I went to.
[295:36.92]You say them all the time.
[295:40.91]Hey, BS.
[295:44.37]All you had to do was read it.
[295:46.13]No.
[295:54.98]Minus two.
[295:55.98]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[295:58.86]Thank you, BS, for the five dollars.
[296:00.34]Hey, German, it's my birthday tomorrow as well.
[296:01.92]Gonna be weird in lockdown times.
[296:03.36]Thanks for keeping us all a little more sane.
[296:06.62]Thank you.
[296:07.96]Take care of yourself.
[296:14.28]It's supposed to get... Supposed to get kind of wild here over the next couple weeks in the States.
[296:21.42]Please take care of yourselves, guys.
[296:22.78]For real.
[296:24.49]Trans Scout, thanks for 300 bits, plus two and minus two actually correlate to penis size.
[296:29.90]And I'm saying it again.
[296:35.06]no that doesn't you know how up that is do you understand like you you you imagining this stuff all of you in chat right now is freaking me out it's just next level odd and I did this it's my fault and now I know what all you were thinking when you see all this I know exactly what you're thinking
[297:02.89]And you need to stop thinking that.
[297:04.25]Because we're done with that.
[297:08.21]It's all my fault.
[297:09.85]It is.
[297:10.61]Hey, Evil Zoe, thanks for the 300 bits.
[297:12.20]Babe, it's time for your dick shrinking.
[297:18.64]I'm not reading any more of these.
[297:20.20]Untold Sewage, thanks for the $5.
[297:22.22]German, can you do your best impression of the pallbearer?
[297:24.19]Stay safe.
[297:25.83]Oh, yes.
[297:28.25]The Undertaker.
[297:30.11]he will destroy you thanks for the 500 bits uh goo berry juice thanks for the 250.
[297:49.07]Jerma, my dad is God.
[297:51.21]I can make a potion to make you immune to all curses.
[297:53.99]Champion of Pog and Jerma's Super Frog.
[297:56.92]Turn up the heat.
[297:57.88]Make sure to say feet.
[297:59.36]Say when the dwarf begins to wink, his penis, it shall shrink.
[298:03.32]Eat the candied shoe and from thine eyes shall stream poo.
[298:06.72]Hope that helps once again.
[298:07.93]I'm glad you're back.
[298:09.95]No, that didn't help at all.
[298:12.51]You just took lighter fluid and poured it on the fire.
[298:16.77]I'm still cursed.
[298:22.83]And that's it.
[298:24.51]I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[298:27.81]This is the worst crack chat yet.
[298:30.09]And it's weird because it's like feeding into me.
[298:32.75]Like the crack chat is just feeding into me and I'm getting like cracked out.
[298:38.95]I'm getting cracked the fuck out now too.
[298:41.81]The last like couple of hours it's been like I've been like kind of getting cracked out.
[298:49.04]All right.
[298:49.74]I'll see you guys Wednesday.
[298:51.10]Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and probably Saturday as well.
[298:54.27]We'll try these three to six, like four to six, four to five hour streams for a while and see how we do.
[299:02.57]Keith King Crimson, thanks for the $2.50.
[299:04.39]That's a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure reference.
[299:07.70]I'm freezing.
[299:09.48]I just froze.
[299:10.62]I think the cam's not on.
[299:11.80]To lift the spider's curse, simply recite a Bible verse.
[299:14.76]Sure.
[299:15.92]How about, um,
[299:21.51]This is a weird thing to Google.
[299:22.81]Bible verse about lifting curses.
[299:33.80]Okay, here we go.
[299:36.26]Oh, we've got the... There's Leviticus.
[299:41.85]There's a Leviticus.
[299:43.65]Leviticus?
[299:44.41]That's where that's from.
[299:45.07]Leviticus.
[299:46.05]I say that all the time.
[299:55.35]Okay, breaking curses.
[300:02.43]Uh... Psalms 144, 1?
[300:04.03]How does that break it?
[300:05.17]Did it work?
[300:19.88]I'm just gonna curse him again.
[300:20.96]Like, there's no cool town, period?
[300:25.34]Ah, I got my curse removed.
[300:26.36]You can just do it again.
[300:27.08]There's gotta be, like, a curse, like, immunity or something for a while, right?
[300:31.77]Just hit him again.
[300:32.33]I don't know.
[300:35.03]Check your face.
[300:44.78]See you guys on Wednesday.
[300:45.78]Good night.
[300:47.62]Take care.
[300:48.20]See you soon.
[300:49.48]And goodbye.
[301:37.37]Thank you.
