[01:03.18]I think your hand has to be over here.
[01:06.70]Yeah, you gotta be over here.
[01:10.31]Now that's tangling it up.
[01:13.77]Hey!
[01:14.27]Oh, hi guys!
[01:14.87]I didn't even see you there.
[01:15.69]I didn't even smell you there.
[01:16.53]Hey guys, how you doing?
[01:18.05]Hey guys.
[01:19.78]For the last time.
[01:20.88]For the last time.
[01:22.26]Ever.
[01:24.24]For the last time ever.
[01:25.16]For the last time ever in the year 2017.
[01:26.68]This is Alex's final stream here.
[01:31.28]So, everybody says good one.
[01:33.48]Yeah, well, if I could turn down for what?
[01:35.40]Turn down forever.
[01:36.60]You know what I mean?
[01:41.03]Alright, let's do that.
[01:42.01]That's like an explanation joke.
[01:43.95]There's an explanation joke here.
[01:46.23]So, let me go to the scene.
[01:49.05]let's go to the scene of the crime so you can uh oh hold on I don't know what that was but uh so we were laughing about he wanted me to tweet because we were talking about turn down we were saying turn down forever would be like a fun just like tweet because people would be like what the fuck does that mean turn down for what like turn down forever turn the fucking music down don't ever turn it on again
[02:08.56]And then it got, like, weird.
[02:09.90]Because I was like, I don't want to do that.
[02:11.86]Because I don't know if that's, like... That's, like, kind of, like, not... It was also 5 o'clock in the morning.
[02:16.38]Yeah, but, like, if you guys just got a tweet from me saying, Turn down for what?
[02:20.24]Turn down forever.
[02:22.34]It'd be like... What the fuck are you talking about?
[02:24.94]Like... What does that mean, Jeremy?
[02:28.93]But, anyways... Tonight's going to be the last local co-op stream.
[02:34.77]Etalyx is leaving after today.
[02:36.25]We'll not...
[02:37.15]Not technically.
[02:37.95]Not technically.
[02:38.91]But kind of technically.
[02:40.51]Kind of.
[02:41.25]Actually.
[02:42.29]This is the last stream he's going to be on.
[02:44.93]He's not coming back.
[02:46.25]You know, so might as well get your jokes out now.
[02:48.63]Because he ain't coming back.
[02:51.90]Everybody say hi and bye to Etalyx tonight.
[02:53.92]See you later.
[02:54.78]We got a few hours before you need to start crying.
[02:57.60]I already got over my crying, so it's okay.
[03:01.80]You're going to leave his body in my house?
[03:06.65]Alex is not going to die.
[03:08.53]Cheers to the last stream.
[03:10.19]No, we don't redo jokes here.
[03:11.97]It's not a joke.
[03:12.99]You just said it.
[03:14.85]You just said cheers.
[03:16.11]You said the cheers to that.
[03:17.11]No, I didn't.
[03:17.53]I said cheers to the last stream.
[03:20.33]That's not the joke.
[03:21.31]That's just a phrase that people do when they crack open a can of Shake Hard Count to Ten and open slowly down east unfiltered.
[03:29.02]You want to try it at the same time?
[03:30.83]Do what?
[03:31.50]It's supposed to be good.
[03:32.80]This is Down East Winter Blend.
[03:34.22]If you have Down East, I recommend it.
[03:38.78]And that is not as good as I thought it was going to be.
[03:41.92]Anyways, so, we got the Nintendo Switch.
[03:45.73]He's got the watermelon version of Nintendo Switch.
[03:47.81]That means it's the good one.
[03:48.71]And we're going to play a bunch of fucking games.
[03:50.25]Local co-op games you can only play on Switch.
[03:52.35]Is that true?
[03:55.42]For a lot of these, yeah.
[03:56.44]Okay, let's make sure, like, some of that is correct.
[03:58.40]Some of that is definitely correct.
[03:59.78]But you certainly can only play with the Nintendo Switch patented, not a Wiimote controller, only on the Nintendo Switch.
[04:05.26]By the way, I don't like these.
[04:07.88]Here's my concern, okay?
[04:10.46]I don't like, my hands are too big, you know what I'm saying?
[04:13.12]I'm playing on, like, fucking, like, an ice cream sandwich.
[04:15.21]Like, this is bullshit.
[04:16.07]Like, I don't like it.
[04:17.59]Like, look at this.
[04:18.63]Am I supposed to enjoy this?
[04:20.49]That's not fun.
[04:22.03]That's fucking bullshit.
[04:23.71]It's when you pop the kickstand out and you go... And you get both of them.
[04:28.47]And once you just hand it over and that's what the convenience factor is for.
[04:31.83]That's what the selling point of the Switch is.
[04:33.27]So glad you're leaving tonight.
[04:35.26]Let's go.
[04:35.52]We're going to start with Snipperclips.
[04:37.22]It's supposed to be a fun puzzle game that you play with your friend in the basement.
[04:40.28]Like where he is.
[04:41.28]Yeah.
[04:41.58]Open it up.
[04:42.96]Get it open.
[04:43.74]Because I don't want anyone to see the secrets of what Legos we have.
[04:45.80]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[04:46.82]Give me your controller.
[04:48.21]You need two?
[04:48.67]Yeah, I need that.
[04:50.16]Why do you need them both?
[04:50.88]Oh, because I'm... Should you give me the red one then?
[04:53.27]Hold on.
[04:55.07]We're still setting things up here.
[04:56.57]I'm going to be player one.
[04:57.17]We're not even fucking ready.
[04:58.53]I'm going to be player one.
[04:59.57]Okay.
[05:01.77]And then you're... You're going to be player two.
[05:05.72]There you go.
[05:06.08]They can't hear that yet.
[05:07.70]Maybe they can.
[05:09.44]Doesn't matter.
[05:10.60]So now I get the green one.
[05:12.30]So are you ready to open it?
[05:13.56]We're starting with... We're going to play Snipperclips.
[05:15.72]Snipperclips.
[05:17.20]You have to work together.
[05:18.10]It's a puzzle game.
[05:19.62]You have to like make yourself big and small and tiny and large and whatever.
[05:25.06]There we go.
[05:26.98]We can see it.
[05:27.50]When playing with the Joy-Con controller, do we recommend using Joy-Con straps?
[05:30.86]What does that mean?
[05:32.14]It means there's a plastic extender that also has a strap you can put around your wrist to prevent you from, you know, breaking mom's big screen TV.
[05:39.66]Play Odyssey?
[05:40.28]No, this is a local co-op.
[05:41.21]Why don't we play Mario?
[05:43.24]Alright, how long are we going to do this for?
[05:45.00]Because I kind of only want to do this for five minutes.
[05:48.12]It was your idea.
[05:55.81]That is true.
[05:56.35]Okay, press any button.
[05:58.31]So this is called Snipperclips Get It Together.
[06:01.79]Two players.
[06:03.19]This is going to confuse me because you're the... I don't... Okay.
[06:08.11]Just hold it like this.
[06:09.15]So if you guys ever played, what does this remind me of?
[06:11.03]No.
[06:12.17]Is the audio working?
[06:13.47]Yeah.
[06:13.57]Can you hear it?
[06:15.05]I can't, but can they?
[06:18.68]Yeah.
[06:19.80]Oh.
[06:21.24]Please hold your ice cream sandwich like shown.
[06:23.96]OK.
[06:24.46]Fix the guys.
[06:25.78]We get a cute little.
[06:26.64]This is really loud.
[06:31.35]There we go.
[06:31.83]No, that's better.
[06:32.77]That's a little better.
[06:36.81]I like this game.
[06:37.43]I want to do this for 50 minutes.
[06:39.71]Are we doing like a plus minute joke right now?
[06:41.71]Does it start at five and then it just go up to 50 and then back down?
[06:44.41]It doesn't need to.
[06:44.91]Alright, we need to pay attention.
[06:45.89]Use the eyeball to move to your character to fill in the shape and then hold still.
[06:49.86]We're making a butt.
[06:52.44]Perfect.
[06:53.36]First try.
[06:53.78]Perfect.
[06:54.78]It's too quiet.
[06:55.86]Hey, is it?
[06:58.27]Okay, that's a little better.
[06:59.97]You can crouch or you can tiptoe.
[07:01.43]So you can raise your head high or low so you can fill the spots in.
[07:05.29]I'll get this one.
[07:06.79]No, no, get out of here.
[07:08.73]Alright, you want to like start that like dumb shit joke?
[07:13.36]No, I'm trying to like figure out the controls, okay?
[07:16.84]You came over to my space, get out.
[07:18.48]It's like the room where you shared with your little brother.
[07:20.86]You just ruined the whole thing.
[07:23.40]press I need to read this press and hold y to perform yourself press it again I missed the whole tutorial okay that's the cut where the two characters overlap so you have to so you have to get over here so you have to cut me so you cut me alright now I gotta come over cut you
[07:47.05]Like this.
[07:47.57]What was it, B?
[07:49.87]Got it.
[07:50.65]They're all turned sideways when you're holding the controller like this.
[07:52.93]And they're two Js, just like us.
[07:54.49]Jeremy and Jeraux.
[07:56.64]Perfect.
[07:58.56]Hold to reform each character.
[08:01.94]You, like, hold your breath and pop.
[08:03.78]Press S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S.
[08:07.39]Shoulder left and shoulder right.
[08:08.85]Come on.
[08:09.39]What do you call yourself, a gamer?
[08:10.83]Shoulder left and sho- who the fuck has ever called it that?
[08:13.71]I just did.
[08:14.73]Alright, rotate.
[08:15.53]So that's how you rotate.
[08:16.34]So which- so you gotta go like that.
[08:17.68]Which one do you want?
[08:18.54]You want that one?
[08:19.12]Make sure it's like perfect though.
[08:22.38]And then now... I want 100% completion on this game.
[08:24.36]That's fine.
[08:24.82]I want all the achievements.
[08:29.77]Press B to jump to get the pencil eraser.
[08:32.97]Aw, teamwork!
[08:33.73]That's a co-op stream right there.
[08:37.34]You should've been a little harder than that.
[08:38.87]You should've been a little harder than that.
[08:41.39]I think if we watched the instant replay, the high five went further towards this side than the other.
[08:46.17]By pressing the- what is that?
[08:47.59]Battery?
[08:48.11]Press the battery button in the main menu?
[08:49.43]What's the fuckin' battery?
[08:51.03]Ah, I got you.
[08:51.54]That was a fuckin' cheers for that.
[08:52.62]The joke well is dry.
[08:57.52]Alright, we're gonna do VPB?
[09:01.52]This is the third co-op stream.
[09:03.54]There's nothing left in the tank here.
[09:07.80]Hey, we've exacerbated every joke that's possible with two guys in a room together.
[09:12.47]Alright, let's do one.
[09:14.05]You can do two to four players.
[09:15.20]That's kind of insane.
[09:17.61]Well, we're obviously going to do the pizza Doritos party.
[09:21.05]Thank you, Alezzo Janova, for the $5.
[09:24.49]Are you making Etalyx sit on a compact chair so you look taller?
[09:30.09]I want everyone to see the chair that I'm sitting on.
[09:31.72]No, no, no.
[09:32.50]Go watch the first stream.
[09:33.68]You got to see a back-to-back doctor's office measurement, and you could see how fucking tall I am.
[09:37.74]Regardless of height, I would like to see the hospitality that has been shown to me whilst here.
[09:43.20]Plenty of fucking hospitality.
[09:44.36]What are you talking about?
[09:47.27]What?
[09:47.43]What's wrong with that?
[09:49.37]What?
[09:49.55]Hold on.
[09:51.39]What?
[09:51.93]That's a fucking good chair.
[09:53.57]This is what I've had to sit on every single co-op stream.
[09:56.41]Well, look at what I have to sit on.
[09:57.65]Like, give me a break.
[09:58.49]What's wrong?
[09:59.01]You have such a better chair than I do?
[10:00.93]Going camping with Jerma.
[10:03.27]Look, I have like a fucking office chair.
[10:05.21]It's like a shitty office chair.
[10:06.39]Look, you have such a big problem.
[10:09.23]I got that thing on sale at a yard sale.
[10:10.95]Like, it's comfortable.
[10:12.09]It's nice.
[10:12.47]I would rather be sitting in that chair, actually.
[10:14.43]The dining room chair I normally stream in is more comfortable than this one.
[10:17.23]I would rather be sitting in that chair.
[10:18.89]Just didn't offer it to me.
[10:19.83]And it offers off the table now.
[10:21.88]Too late.
[10:22.14]You already sat back down.
[10:25.12]Go stream a camping trip?
[10:28.06]Why would I ever fucking do that?
[10:30.20]Alright, so let's go.
[10:30.90]The number of plays, do we have to pair it?
[10:32.38]We have to... Two.
[10:33.19]Okay.
[10:34.17]That was the tutorial.
[10:34.93]Now we're starting, like, the game.
[10:36.15]Now we're starting the actual game.
[10:37.65]Noisy Notebook.
[10:39.03]Also, probably switch the screen back on.
[10:42.63]Guy doesn't even stream.
[10:44.07]I'm not used to streaming with two people.
[10:46.31]Guy doesn't even remember how to stream.
[10:47.89]It's been like a few days.
[10:48.85]I just don't, I just, when there's two people in the room, I like forget, I don't even know what I'm doing.
[10:53.17]I forget this even like.
[10:53.87]Alright, we have like a bunch of options here.
[10:55.97]Alright, let's do balloon burster.
[10:59.67]So we're going to burst balloons.
[11:03.50]I'm not a good streamer.
[11:05.14]I know.
[11:05.42]Alright, so we're going to pop the balloons.
[11:09.88]So far, so good.
[11:10.48]That's not how you do it.
[11:12.88]So I'm gonna assume... Alright, if we just squeeze them between the butt cheeks, maybe.
[11:15.66]What about, like, can you turn, you can turn... Hold on.
[11:17.95]Oh, okay, wait, wait, wait, watch this.
[11:19.69]I'm gonna turn you into a knife.
[11:21.13]Watch this, ready?
[11:21.65]So, like, tilt a little bit so I can make you, like, a knife.
[11:27.27]There you go.
[11:29.54]Now you're just gonna jump and, like, stab that way.
[11:31.00]Well, I do have a pointy bit.
[11:33.14]Perfect.
[11:34.06]There we go.
[11:34.80]Okay, now reform it.
[11:35.78]Oh, that was so funny.
[11:36.66]Reform it and, like, here, cut me.
[11:38.02]Okay.
[11:39.24]Cut me, like... Hang on, I need... There needs to be, like, a sharper edge.
[11:42.65]Like, yeah, like that.
[11:44.21]I'm gonna make you into a sickle.
[11:46.67]Yeah.
[11:47.43]So cut it.
[11:50.18]So now, I'm gonna stand on you, and I'm gonna dig it.
[11:53.52]I'm gonna dig this fucking toenail.
[11:55.80]Here we go.
[11:56.36]There you go!
[12:01.63]Beautiful.
[12:02.27]Beautiful.
[12:02.75]Come up here.
[12:04.27]Just keep me as the sickle.
[12:05.61]Now you, you jump.
[12:12.42]Ready?
[12:13.18]One.
[12:13.42]Ready?
[12:13.92]One, two.
[12:14.84]I don't got it.
[12:15.48]Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[12:17.04]There's like a little handle.
[12:18.70]I can just grab it with my grabber.
[12:20.39]Grab the grabber with the handle.
[12:21.79]Yeah.
[12:24.19]Beautiful.
[12:24.57]Alright.
[12:25.41]Now that we got it down here, what do we do?
[12:27.07]You have to cut it.
[12:28.09]Let me give you like a... You're not going to be able to get it that way.
[12:31.37]I think I am.
[12:32.09]It's just as pointy.
[12:33.01]I'll have to crouch, though.
[12:34.40]Here.
[12:36.46]Mm-mm.
[12:36.80]Not going to happen.
[12:37.88]You're not sharp enough.
[12:39.76]I don't think it's sharp enough.
[12:40.76]Okay, what do you want?
[12:41.60]Hang on, I can hold it.
[12:43.72]Transfer?
[12:44.30]There comes the sickle.
[12:46.56]I trapped it.
[12:48.48]Great work.
[12:50.12]Great work.
[12:50.74]We did it.
[12:52.18]We're doing an educational stream.
[12:53.90]This is actually a video game stream.
[12:56.04]You haven't seen one of these in like six days.
[12:59.20]How do we go?
[13:01.67]Oh, okay.
[13:02.25]Yeah.
[13:03.47]Once out of every three streams, you gotta play a video game.
[13:07.20]So do we just, like, beat... Apparently the game is a little bit loud, according to moderators who are trying to get your attention.
[13:15.30]He's up, he's down, he's up, he's down.
[13:16.77]Like, where's the right place?
[13:17.77]Alright, let's go with the hamster ball.
[13:19.93]Let's do the hamster.
[13:21.29]Baseball one.
[13:22.69]Basketball one.
[13:23.27]But that's probably the funnest one.
[13:24.13]Let's do the hamster helper.
[13:25.59]Hamster helper.
[13:28.21]Why am I playing a game with a friend?
[13:31.95]Just to show you guys that he does have friends.
[13:33.79]Just to prove to you.
[13:34.51]So how do we get in?
[13:35.15]Can we go in?
[13:36.30]We got like an eraser button.
[13:38.24]I think we have to like go.
[13:39.26]Oh, I have to be aiming this way, right?
[13:42.42]Okay, well there's the hamster.
[13:43.36]And we want to get the hamster to go into the right.
[13:46.16]Okay.
[13:47.32]Okay, so then you... You see the hamster comes down.
[13:50.97]He's running as fast as he possibly can.
[13:52.74]I think one of us has to turn into a bridge.
[13:55.22]Alright, you turn me into a bridge.
[13:57.72]I'm the red one.
[13:58.72]No, I'm going to turn you into a ramp.
[14:01.04]Right, so... I can't go over you, so I have to cut down here.
[14:05.60]Alright, you stand up.
[14:10.54]Alright.
[14:11.14]Now I can like... Now you should be like... Now maybe I can tip.
[14:14.64]Cut me.
[14:15.56]Cut me like... Cut me like right... What?
[14:17.71]Cut me right... You went too far.
[14:19.19]Come over here.
[14:20.23]Which way do you want me to orient?
[14:21.25]I want you... I want to be like... We want to like grab him with mittens.
[14:23.95]Like this?
[14:24.99]No.
[14:25.19]You got to go lower.
[14:28.51]Like... I'm as low as I can go.
[14:30.95]Now go up.
[14:33.05]Do it again.
[14:34.13]Come up.
[14:34.53]Do it.
[14:34.67]Alright.
[14:35.55]We're going to grab this guy with mittens.
[14:36.57]We're going to...
[14:38.38]Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[14:40.20]Oh, got another one.
[14:41.18]It's okay, we got infinite hamsters here.
[14:42.58]Because there's plenty of hamsters.
[14:44.44]So I'm going to roll them to you, and you're going to have to go off the ramp.
[14:46.90]Okay.
[14:49.72]This is actually working!
[14:54.33]Great work.
[14:55.03]Great work.
[14:57.95]Wait, do it again?
[14:58.61]Oh, no, no, no.
[14:59.43]Wait, we're done.
[15:00.03]Oh, this is so cute.
[15:06.49]It's two down, two check.
[15:07.75]This game is actually pretty fun to play with your dad.
[15:09.83]You know what I mean?
[15:10.72]You can play this with your son or your dad.
[15:13.24]He plays with a guy who looks like your dad.
[15:14.64]Alright, let's go.
[15:18.14]Which one do you want?
[15:19.16]Let's do... Make the cut.
[15:20.22]Make the cut.
[15:23.95]Dynamic Tension.
[15:26.17]You want this game, but it's only for the Nintendo Switch.
[15:28.67]So this one we have to make this shape.
[15:31.24]Wait, which one are we making?
[15:32.08]The bottom shape?
[15:33.68]I think we want the bottom shape.
[15:35.02]Let's find out what happens when we hit the pencil.
[15:38.95]I think it takes a snapshot.
[15:40.29]No, it resets it.
[15:42.85]So you gotta come over here.
[15:44.69]Come to my right, and you gotta cut me right on the edge there.
[15:47.99]Oh, we have to fill up that.
[15:49.89]Are you sure?
[15:50.43]Cut it.
[15:51.51]Okay, now, wait, wait, wait.
[15:55.37]I think we just keep cutting it into that shape.
[15:57.76]Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.
[15:59.08]We can get it.
[15:59.54]That's how we do it.
[16:00.62]We don't need you.
[16:01.60]You don't need to be cut.
[16:02.42]What?
[16:03.40]Hold on, we don't really need to cut the purple.
[16:05.40]Look, let me just, ah, I almost, whatever.
[16:08.18]Next.
[16:08.56]Oh, I thought we were supposed to fit inside of there.
[16:10.76]No.
[16:11.22]We made a little bunny rabbit tree.
[16:13.12]That was a bad one.
[16:13.78]I thought we were supposed to fit inside there.
[16:15.61]No.
[16:16.01]Let's do one of the fun looking ones.
[16:17.11]That one was really easy.
[16:18.23]Baseball.
[16:20.41]I'm stupid.
[16:20.99]What are you?
[16:22.81]The tutorial taught us that we're supposed to fill shapes.
[16:25.43]That's true.
[16:26.29]That was the tutorial.
[16:27.29]Slam dunk.
[16:27.67]I thought this was the baseball one.
[16:31.00]Oh, you have to hit the ball into the hoop.
[16:33.94]So I'll stand here.
[16:35.02]What do you do when the baseball is stuck in the corner, though?
[16:38.37]So I'll be the tee.
[16:39.93]Okay.
[16:40.39]So you move out of the way.
[16:41.23]Hang on, we can just roll it into the hoop.
[16:43.43]Oh, yeah, we can.
[16:44.05]Alright, so ready?
[16:44.59]On the count of three, we're going to move.
[16:45.79]Ready?
[16:45.97]One, two, three, go.
[16:48.10]You didn't decide to move.
[16:53.18]I don't think this is what you're supposed to do.
[16:55.32]Yes, it is.
[16:56.18]Is it?
[16:56.66]Baseball.
[16:57.78]It's going to get higher, right?
[16:58.76]This whole game is going to get harder in about 15 seconds.
[17:04.35]Cute little game.
[17:04.97]Basketball?
[17:05.47]Yeah, why is it a baseball?
[17:06.71]Was that the baseball one or the basketball one?
[17:08.43]That was baseball.
[17:09.17]Look, that's a baseball.
[17:10.41]So, wait, there's a basketball.
[17:11.67]That was definitely baseball-ing.
[17:13.27]Alright, let's do basketball-ing.
[17:14.83]Alley-oop.
[17:15.31]So, we're gonna have to, like, pass to one another.
[17:16.93]That's okay.
[17:18.05]I'll bump it up.
[17:20.77]Ready, go.
[17:21.01]This is the Snipperclip speed run.
[17:23.04]So, yeah, you hit it to me.
[17:24.20]I can't, like... So, you're gonna angle it like this.
[17:26.22]You're gonna have to help me here.
[17:29.52]Cut me into something that can reach in there, like a little pin that you would hit the reset button.
[17:34.48]Okay.
[17:36.76]You can do it with that hook.
[17:39.62]Alright, watch out.
[17:42.06]Alright, so you have to bounce it off your head into the hook.
[17:44.90]Because I have to stay here.
[17:46.24]Alright, you stay there and go.
[17:47.38]Hold on, I got it.
[17:51.53]Double dribble!
[17:53.17]You almost got it.
[17:55.96]There it is.
[17:57.36]Nothing but net.
[17:58.98]A plus.
[18:01.36]Stupid idiot.
[18:05.64]Why am I an idiot?
[18:07.06]We just won.
[18:08.28]That was a complete game.
[18:10.98]Hey, thank you.
[18:11.94]Oh, we missed some bits here.
[18:12.77]Hold on.
[18:13.71]We can play.
[18:14.85]How many levels are there?
[18:15.51]Liberta, thanks for the bits.
[18:17.45]And Trita, thanks for the $1.
[18:18.59]How is Etalyx so beautiful?
[18:21.06]We've discussed this before.
[18:22.85]He's alright.
[18:23.37]We haven't come up to a concrete conclusion other than good genes.
[18:26.29]He's like, he's alright.
[18:28.03]He's alright.
[18:28.59]Don't inflate egos here.
[18:30.79]I'm alright.
[18:31.71]He's alright.
[18:32.57]Everybody's alright.
[18:33.29]Plus one.
[18:33.59]Alright.
[18:33.91]Plus one.
[18:34.29]Everybody's alright.
[18:35.61]We don't talk about how handsome he is on my stream.
[18:38.41]He's alright.
[18:38.89]I'm alright.
[18:39.33]You're alright.
[18:39.85]Anyways, thank you.
[18:42.38]Thank you, Backbiter for the $1.
[18:44.08]Switch chairs.
[18:44.92]No.
[18:46.02]It was his fault.
[18:48.60]Kill Gannon, thanks for the $1.
[18:50.44]I came to Twitch looking for local co-op gameplay and by God, I found it.
[18:54.08]That's what I'd say if it was 1999.
[18:56.00]What?
[18:56.42]Whoa.
[18:56.76]Did they have co-op games in 1999?
[19:00.57]There was no super clips back in... There was no sports clips back in... There was no super cuts back in 1999.
[19:08.89]You couldn't get a fucking haircut anywhere in the world.
[19:12.01]Thank you, Abnormality, for the $5.
[19:14.97]Well, does Etalyx live with you now?
[19:16.45]Heck yeah.
[19:17.35]You can be like bros like every day, man.
[19:19.73]Like all the time.
[19:20.51]Nice.
[19:20.81]Cheers to that.
[19:21.39]Let's do the monkey.
[19:22.71]I do.
[19:24.78]I got a one-way ticket.
[19:26.46]He's never leaving.
[19:27.98]There was no round trip.
[19:29.92]Mario Party when?
[19:30.78]I don't know.
[19:32.18]This is the crane game.
[19:34.44]We got a monkey crane.
[19:38.09]You got to pick me up.
[19:39.51]So let's turn you.
[19:40.05]Let's make you easier to get.
[19:40.89]So come here.
[19:41.79]Alright.
[19:43.05]We want me to be like a mushroom, like wider at the top, thinner at the bottom.
[19:46.52]Crouch.
[19:47.58]Hang on.
[19:47.88]Thinner.
[19:49.06]No, wider at the top.
[19:49.94]You're about to cut the top off.
[19:51.58]Don't you want to be the other way?
[19:52.86]I'm going to a different hairdresser after this.
[19:55.16]Look, trust me.
[19:57.00]There we go.
[19:57.58]Go down.
[19:58.22]No, I want to go down.
[19:59.56]Just go like this.
[20:00.47]I want to be taller so that when I come... I'll give you $5,000 if this doesn't work.
[20:04.47]Go.
[20:04.61]What do you want?
[20:05.33]Down.
[20:13.95]Spin it around.
[20:14.45]All the way.
[20:18.29]Like that.
[20:19.33]Let him grab you.
[20:19.81]Come here.
[20:23.38]You don't move out of the way.
[20:27.37]Excuse me.
[20:28.09]Excuse me.
[20:29.07]Excuse me.
[20:30.55]Excuse me.
[20:31.23]What?
[20:32.37]That was intentional grounding.
[20:34.25]No, that's not how it works.
[20:35.13]What?
[20:35.82]That was intentional grounding.
[20:37.30]I mean, as far as I know, I'm rich now.
[20:39.52]Intentional grounding.
[20:40.26]That's like a penalty, like a flag came up on the field.
[20:43.14]Like that would have been funny, but like that's that's intentional grounding again.
[20:46.21]It didn't work again This is intentional grounding again.
[20:48.37]You like fucked it up You know how like the you have to be facing that in the claw machine though.
[20:53.01]It always picks it up It starts to carry it towards the drop off and then it falls every single time intentional grounding You're intentionally grounding the football right?
[21:04.42]Okay, the game broke is what happened you have to stand on the dropper the game fucking broke is what happened is what you don't understand I
[21:12.77]struggling to duplicate the successes of the past right now.
[21:16.69]He doesn't understand the controls.
[21:19.25]I do understand the controls, but this game is made for fucking children.
[21:24.73]Come on, keep going.
[21:25.75]Alright, now you just want to be on the drop.
[21:27.55]Look, I'm going to help you out here.
[21:28.99]I'm going to help you out.
[21:30.07]Okay.
[21:31.13]There you go.
[21:34.81]You did that.
[21:35.25]That was all you that time.
[21:38.07]Okay, here we go.
[21:41.27]I'm not touching a single button.
[21:48.06]We did it.
[21:49.00]Kept my $5,000.
[21:49.64]Now, uh, I'll be expecting that paypal.
[21:54.00]That was for that play.
[21:54.96]After... No, you got a penalty, so you threw it in the trash.
[21:59.00]You don't come back from cheating.
[22:00.41]All the bits go to me now?
[22:01.57]No, you don't come back from cheating.
[22:02.59]You don't come back from cheating to, like, expect to be treated fairly for the rest of the game.
[22:07.11]You can't, like, you can't punch somebody in the face in boxing with brass knuckles on under your gloves and then be like, well, no, hold on, I took them off.
[22:13.35]I can still do the rest of the fight.
[22:14.61]Uh-uh.
[22:14.85]You're disqualified.
[22:18.11]What are we doing?
[22:19.47]5,000 bucks.
[22:19.83]Alright, we gotta get the fly into the bug zapper and kill the fly.
[22:25.47]Easy.
[22:26.37]Turn me into a net.
[22:29.83]It can take you a few minutes.
[22:31.21]Yeah, because you're diagonal right now.
[22:32.86]It'd be way easier if you were in a straight orientation.
[22:35.52]Just like up and down.
[22:36.76]Turn me into a net.
[22:37.52]Like that.
[22:37.94]OK, you went the wrong way.
[22:38.92]No, no, no.
[22:39.98]Pick one.
[22:40.40]Just pick a direction.
[22:41.48]Alright, turn me into a net.
[22:44.88]Where are you going?
[22:45.48]You just wait.
[22:46.28]Just be calm.
[22:50.40]Oh, wrong way.
[22:51.36]Blow up for me, please.
[22:53.32]Something happened.
[22:53.74]Did you do something wrong?
[22:54.32]I can't really turn you into a net with the same size.
[22:57.56]Like, there's not going to be a hollow middle.
[22:59.50]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[23:01.16]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[23:01.70]Stay like this.
[23:02.28]Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
[23:03.48]No, you stay.
[23:04.24]Watch.
[23:04.62]Watch this.
[23:04.98]Just trust me.
[23:05.44]Trust me, trust me, trust me.
[23:06.59]I'll give you $5,000 if you listen to me.
[23:12.85]How about that?
[23:13.29]I have to cut you into a smaller piece so then you can cut me.
[23:18.51]I don't need your help.
[23:19.79]I have to cut you into a smaller piece then you cut me in the middle.
[23:27.25]Now let him go.
[23:27.87]Why did you have to rock the boat?
[23:29.57]Just let him go.
[23:31.51]Now he's going to swing down.
[23:37.66]He launched a fly to the left, so you have to flip it around on him, jump up, and then he... I thought he just said... There we go.
[23:47.65]I won that one.
[23:48.29]That was all me.
[23:50.95]If I had cut you small... You did.
[23:52.97]I am tiny.
[23:53.61]But you could have cut me in the middle and I could have actually trapped him.
[23:57.31]There you go.
[23:58.55]That's not what I meant.
[23:59.33]We already won.
[24:00.01]Listen, no use crying over me winning the game.
[24:02.97]There's only one more level here before the new one.
[24:08.01]You want us to go up here so you can see more of the actual game?
[24:11.19]That makes more sense.
[24:13.23]We'll go, like, up here.
[24:18.19]That's better.
[24:18.57]So now you guys see that it doesn't block your guys' view.
[24:21.08]Alright, so this one is... This one is a fill the shape.
[24:25.50]Yeah.
[24:27.00]So we have to do some strategic cutting here.
[24:29.54]So you have to cut just like there.
[24:32.80]And you have to cut me on the top.
[24:35.99]You have to flip around.
[24:37.09]Yeah, but I don't want to cut you.
[24:38.03]I'm going to cut you deep here.
[24:40.39]You already have.
[24:40.97]See what I'm talking about?
[24:43.88]You already cut me in half.
[24:45.16]Say it like that.
[24:47.22]And I'll come back.
[24:49.04]Wait, come back down again?
[24:50.16]Let me get this little bit.
[24:50.92]It just needs to be flat.
[24:51.74]I mean, I need just like a little bit off the top.
[24:54.66]No, you're going to be very crooked.
[24:56.20]It's going to be crooked.
[24:57.38]Hold on.
[24:58.02]Right there.
[24:58.66]What are we building a bridge?
[25:00.20]You're going to be fine.
[25:01.74]Doesn't need to be like exact.
[25:04.57]Now it's exact.
[25:05.39]Alright.
[25:07.88]Bingo presto.
[25:09.45]You took a little too much off the top.
[25:11.57]Look over there.
[25:13.73]Tilt it down a little.
[25:17.47]That was very specific, but there it is.
[25:19.49]We won.
[25:19.69]Good work.
[25:20.49]No, great work.
[25:22.83]We made a bird.
[25:29.76]There's one more.
[25:31.34]One more.
[25:31.96]And then we unlock the mystery levels.
[25:34.14]We actually did.
[25:34.80]This is a new one.
[25:35.62]Star Stages are special.
[25:36.60]In the first one of each world, the exit option lets you skip.
[25:38.86]This is just the first world.
[25:40.71]There's probably like 500 puzzles in this game.
[25:42.59]Yeah.
[25:43.03]There's probably more than that.
[25:43.79]There's probably like 1,000 puzzles.
[25:44.91]I think I read somewhere on IGN they gave this game 5,000 puzzles out of 10.
[25:48.99]Like an 8 out of 10?
[25:51.97]No.
[25:52.29]5,000 puzzles out of 10,000 puzzles.
[25:55.06]I get it.
[25:55.42]So I'm tilting.
[25:56.16]So we have a bunch of clones.
[25:57.72]So you tilt this way.
[26:01.59]Okay, so now like I'm gonna oh yeah, we are make them we are mimicking them So yeah, I have to like transfer this to you.
[26:08.88]So can you like?
[26:10.54]Alright Now we just needed to go down in the middle, right?
[26:13.88]We do but it might be hard to do that I don't think we can do that from straight down We have to try it like we have to tip this over to like one of us Do you want to be responsible this with me?
[26:23.23]Because you control the one on the bottom, right?
[26:25.37]Do we have to snip each other too?
[26:27.21]Can we just, can we?
[26:28.79]Mm-hmm.
[26:29.21]We can.
[26:29.75]And excuse me.
[26:31.05]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[26:32.43]Excuse me.
[26:33.29]That's too big.
[26:33.93]Hang on, let's each.
[26:34.63]Like that.
[26:35.49]No, watch.
[26:35.79]No, no, no.
[26:36.03]I gotta get rid of this.
[26:36.61]I gotta get rid of that.
[26:37.33]There you go.
[26:37.75]Dip it in.
[26:38.51]Just dump it in.
[26:39.25]Wait.
[26:40.06]Come a little more to the left.
[26:44.06]Dump it in.
[26:44.72]I don't wanna go too fast.
[26:46.04]Nice.
[26:50.18]It's fucking cool.
[26:51.76]Oh, there's more.
[26:52.60]Oh, there's more.
[26:53.26]Look, they even throw us under the bus and we still got it.
[26:58.77]Can you come over here?
[26:59.35]Can I rotate around fast enough?
[27:00.85]Can you come cut me?
[27:03.75]Cut the top right portion of me off.
[27:08.01]Can you crouch a little?
[27:09.60]Got it.
[27:09.74]Nice.
[27:10.08]Perfect.
[27:10.28]There we go.
[27:10.98]Now roll it over.
[27:12.40]Roll it over to you.
[27:13.74]Just like pinball.
[27:16.60]I wanted to catch it.
[27:17.56]Sorry, we're good.
[27:17.94]We got another...
[27:19.84]Three strikes and that's all of our lives.
[27:21.60]Three strikes.
[27:22.98]See, this is what I was trying to do.
[27:26.78]Sorry.
[27:30.19]Okay, it's coming to you.
[27:30.85]Okay, it's coming to you.
[27:31.53]Coming to you.
[27:34.89]Okay, now you just tilt all the way.
[27:39.74]Drop it in there.
[27:40.44]There we go.
[27:41.78]Alright, watch out for another surprise one.
[27:44.32]The children.
[27:46.13]Alright, no, we're gonna do the same thing.
[27:47.49]There was another one.
[27:48.13]You're gonna have to cut me again.
[27:52.39]Wait, actually, can we steamroll this?
[27:55.89]I think we can.
[27:56.59]You have to, like... There it is.
[27:58.97]Careful.
[27:59.35]I can wedge it down there.
[28:00.19]Alright, now, hit the wedge.
[28:01.65]I feel like I'm playing pinball right now.
[28:04.32]Alright, you gotta tilt a little so I don't tip it off.
[28:06.04]No, no, the other way.
[28:08.51]There's no way you're going to get that.
[28:11.95]Stay like there.
[28:12.45]Can I come right there?
[28:15.69]There's a little bit off the top.
[28:17.29]Okay.
[28:18.76]A little bit more.
[28:21.12]Now you should be able to get that over here.
[28:23.14]You've got to dip down a little bit more.
[28:24.60]There it is.
[28:28.10]There you go.
[28:30.97]Oh no!
[28:33.53]Too much power.
[28:36.17]This is the one.
[28:37.21]A little fast, a little furious.
[28:41.05]It's a little like a factory assembly line we've got going on here.
[28:45.12]There it is.
[28:47.76]Alright.
[28:48.22]Nice and easy.
[28:48.70]Roll it in.
[28:49.30]Upside down?
[28:49.86]That's okay.
[28:50.56]Too strong.
[28:50.98]A little heavy handed.
[28:51.66]It's okay.
[28:52.92]A little heavy handed.
[28:53.80]Great work.
[28:55.10]Great job.
[28:56.74]That should be the... I'm going to assume it's three.
[28:58.15]I'm going to assume it's three.
[29:00.11]Okay.
[29:00.37]That's the star.
[29:01.01]That's like the boss puzzle.
[29:02.33]Mm-hmm.
[29:03.90]And then, there were more.
[29:07.48]Alright, so what did we say?
[29:08.58]We clear this board?
[29:10.29]Clear this board, and then we'll move on to another game.
[29:12.45]We got like 40 games, by the way, to go through tonight.
[29:15.55]It's like 40 what?
[29:16.85]44 games?
[29:18.55]We have 44 Switch games.
[29:21.13]Yeah, I had to like, empty my bank account.
[29:23.92]Yeah, he had to pay for all of it.
[29:26.68]I didn't pay for one cent, not my Switch.
[29:32.74]Why do I always have to be, like, the bad guy?
[29:35.48]I'm not even the bad guy.
[29:36.74]You kind of do, just, like, have to be the bad guy.
[29:38.62]I'm not even the bad guy, though.
[29:40.90]Alright, hold on.
[29:42.24]The switch, the entire switch library.
[29:44.92]Alright, so, you need to cut, like, a square block.
[29:47.93]I'll do it.
[29:50.35]It's very, it's gonna be really easy for you if you, wait, no, it's not.
[29:53.35]That might be a little too much.
[29:54.11]Good, okay, same thing.
[29:57.65]Wait, can I, I don't think I can even do that to you now.
[30:01.09]All you have to do, you have to use the like flat end.
[30:05.06]Careful.
[30:05.68]A little more, a little closer.
[30:09.46]Alright, I asked for like a two, I'm getting a four.
[30:15.22]I'm like sticking out through the lines right there.
[30:17.50]Yeah, but I'm using like a weird shape.
[30:21.35]It's a lot easier when you have like a full thing to do it to.
[30:26.92]Just wait.
[30:27.38]Why am I like the winky face one?
[30:30.14]My thumbs are hitting each other.
[30:31.26]Alright, but I'm like the... Oh, there he's like, that's the one.
[30:34.22]Alright, come on, come on.
[30:36.24]Go, go, go, go.
[30:37.72]Why is people writing random numbers?
[30:39.34]I don't know.
[30:41.20]I don't understand.
[30:41.90]Why are you guys writing random fucking numbers?
[30:46.49]782?
[30:46.51]780?
[30:46.71]They're trying to go up the list of all the Nvidia cards that have come out.
[30:50.47]No, they're counting to a thousand.
[30:51.87]They're counting to a thousand.
[30:54.82]Why are you doing that?
[30:56.28]Why are you counting to 1,000?
[30:59.20]Who told you to do this?
[31:02.20]We are counting.
[31:03.12]OK, come over here.
[31:05.58]I think we can get it.
[31:10.54]See, it says dog reading a newspaper.
[31:12.08]It's a fat dog reading a newspaper.
[31:13.92]It's a beanbag dog reading the newspaper.
[31:16.07]And he's eating alphabet soup.
[31:17.95]Alright, let's go.
[31:20.29]Oh, you can push the button at the end of each one and get a special noise?
[31:24.09]I bet these are like the harder versions of each of the ones we just did.
[31:26.75]Pretty much.
[31:29.27]So after this, there's going to be something very special.
[31:32.06]You know what it is, right?
[31:33.56]I kind of, I already forgot.
[31:35.06]But we're going to change the scene.
[31:37.24]You're not going to know until it's time.
[31:38.84]You are not going to want to miss what's coming up next.
[31:40.80]It's like a bowling ball instead of a basketball.
[31:42.94]So it's a little heavier.
[31:44.84]Maybe you, alright, you might, no, no, no.
[31:46.08]You're going to, yeah, you have to walk on me and get it in.
[31:50.62]Okay, so let's create a little dip.
[31:57.56]That wasn't how we do it.
[31:58.36]They might be too small.
[32:00.78]That's gonna be too small.
[32:02.92]Hang on.
[32:03.48]Hold on.
[32:05.94]I don't want to walk on you yet.
[32:07.30]I'm ready to just, like, stay and hold still.
[32:09.20]What are you trying to do to me?
[32:10.28]I want to, like, cut a little bit.
[32:13.97]Oh, just let him count to a thousand.
[32:15.99]Alright.
[32:17.63]Alright.
[32:18.37]You come stay on top of me.
[32:19.95]I stand on top of you.
[32:20.63]Yeah.
[32:22.94]I see, so now you want me to, you want me to, like, carry it.
[32:25.73]There, you carry the ball.
[32:27.27]Okay.
[32:27.57]Careful, you're falling over.
[32:28.63]Right, we're gonna take the jump.
[32:29.79]One, two, three, go.
[32:32.13]Oh.
[32:32.91]It's okay.
[32:33.19]Wait, wait, wait.
[32:33.93]Stay there.
[32:34.79]One more, one more go.
[32:39.81]The jump was a little, the jump was a little weird for me.
[32:42.19]Wait, you're the only time I'm on top of you.
[32:43.63]I didn't mean to, I didn't.
[32:46.19]It's okay.
[32:47.27]I can't, I'm so small.
[32:48.65]I can't do that.
[32:52.05]Why the fuck are they counting to a thousand?
[32:54.69]I don't understand.
[32:57.03]Alright, wait, closer, closer.
[32:59.29]This is gonna, okay though, you're the dad and I'm the son.
[33:01.15]I'm holding you up to get a basket.
[33:02.83]Yeah, you're on my shoulders right now.
[33:04.25]Thanks, daddy.
[33:04.89]I'm gonna get it in.
[33:06.94]Yeah, I did it.
[33:07.96]And you like scream yay and everybody screams yay to give me some positive reinforcement.
[33:11.84]Yeah, why did I dump a bowling ball onto your head though?
[33:14.32]I don't know.
[33:16.74]It's gone too far.
[33:20.03]We're almost at the boss.
[33:22.17]We don't get all the experience points, though.
[33:24.47]Pencil sharpener.
[33:26.77]Yay!
[33:27.66]Yay.
[33:28.22]Yay.
[33:28.70]Yay.
[33:29.58]Oh, no, they're doing... Yeah, thanks, guys.
[33:31.54]Yay.
[33:32.10]Yay for me.
[33:32.58]Yay for him.
[33:33.92]He scored the bowling ball.
[33:35.64]So we're going to get on the Switch controller.
[33:38.64]Or the Fun Dip stick.
[33:40.94]I do like Fun Dip.
[33:42.16]Turn me into something that can poke the pencil eraser.
[33:46.96]Alright, so now what do we have to do?
[33:48.40]We have to carry the pencil all the way over to the pencil sharpener.
[33:51.71]Alright, so you get over here.
[33:53.07]You be like the... Like, hold on.
[33:57.31]I thought that was a wall.
[33:58.33]Okay.
[33:58.67]Alright, I need to turn you into like a shape that is capable of carrying the pencil.
[34:03.08]Yes, we need to work together to carry this pencil over here.
[34:05.68]And then we have to sharpen it.
[34:06.84]Mm-hmm.
[34:09.75]You just make me a little cylinder.
[34:11.25]You are a pencil carrier now.
[34:12.63]I'm just a jar.
[34:13.43]I'm a desk jar.
[34:15.45]Perfect.
[34:15.83]We're going to do the Snoopy dishes thing.
[34:17.86]You ever think of Snoopy dishes?
[34:19.02]That NES game?
[34:19.70]Now we're stuck.
[34:22.40]I love these faces so much.
[34:32.95]Are you intentionally trying to ruin this?
[34:34.63]No, I'm giving you like an elevator.
[34:36.05]Where do I have to do this?
[34:37.43]You just have to dump it in.
[34:38.71]Are you sure?
[34:39.11]Push it over.
[34:42.01]Sharpen that pencil.
[34:43.71]We have to tip it up.
[34:49.44]Keep pushing buttons until it works.
[34:51.26]Sharpen it.
[34:52.86]Good job.
[34:53.30]You did it.
[34:53.82]We did it.
[34:54.16]That one was pretty good.
[34:55.70]That one was pretty fun.
[34:59.02]They're almost done.
[34:59.90]I don't know how you haven't gotten to the end yet.
[35:03.83]Alright, guys.
[35:05.01]New challenge.
[35:05.99]One million.
[35:10.69]We're gonna play hide and seek.
[35:11.93]I'm gonna close my eyes and count to a million.
[35:14.59]You all go hide somewhere throughout the house.
[35:17.63]How many days is a million seconds?
[35:18.51]I'll get you soon.
[35:19.53]No, hold on a minute.
[35:21.58]How many days is one million seconds?
[35:29.99]That's 11 and a half days.
[35:32.01]If you guys sat here and counted to a million, you'd be sitting here for 11 and a half days.
[35:37.10]That'd be funny, but it's not gonna happen.
[35:41.58]Not gonna happen.
[35:43.72]It's not possible to do that.
[35:45.40]Etalyx is gonna be gone by the time you guys finish this.
[35:48.14]Yeah, that's what I said.
[35:49.38]We're gonna play hide and seek.
[35:50.88]I'll count to a million.
[35:52.50]We got lots of shit to do tonight.
[35:53.95]I'll come find you all when I'm done.
[35:55.33]Do you think we have anything better to do?
[35:58.05]What?
[36:00.18]Come on, give yourself some credit.
[36:01.76]Come on.
[36:03.90]You have nothing better to do than count to a million in this chat.
[36:06.81]I don't think so.
[36:08.09]One of you guys is like a fucking scientific researcher.
[36:11.26]You know what?
[36:12.00]Potentially 500 of you are like teachers.
[36:14.53]That's giving way too much.
[36:15.67]Alright, let's break down the chat here.
[36:16.89]There are over 2,600 people here right now, right?
[36:19.31]Yeah.
[36:20.49]I'm going to say half have not completed school.
[36:24.68]600 are probably doctors, I would say.
[36:26.26]500 are probably in medical school right now.
[36:29.30]So 500 are in medical school, 600 doctors.
[36:32.16]Of those 600 doctors, 300 are probably neurosurgeons.
[36:35.14]Of the 300 neurosurgeons, 10 of them have probably won neurosurgery awards.
[36:38.85]That gets us to 1,100.
[36:39.93]I would say... I'd say, yeah, maybe one garbage collector.
[36:43.29]You know, maybe like two garbage collectors.
[36:45.05]Maybe like 50 vets.
[36:46.55]Probably 50 vets.
[36:47.73]I'm gonna say like 400 teachers.
[36:50.87]And of the last like 600, we got like maybe like 200 hedge fund managers.
[36:55.48]And... Probably like two of you work at Twitch.
[36:57.58]Maybe like a priest.
[36:59.00]Anybody in here a priest?
[37:01.32]How many priests?
[37:02.64]One priest?
[37:03.20]How many choir members?
[37:05.12]Well, it has to be... There's six dozen people in a choir, so there's a priest and a choir.
[37:09.20]So there's like 150 people.
[37:11.24]And to round it all out, the... How many are we missing?
[37:14.29]Every president that's ever lived is also probably in here right now.
[37:17.45]The ghost.
[37:17.87]I mean, that would make sense, to me at least.
[37:21.07]Alright, let's get some gumballs.
[37:25.97]You're a wizard.
[37:27.47]Come on.
[37:30.04]It's getting a little outrageous there.
[37:31.38]Alright, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[37:33.34]I don't know how many times I have to tell you to stop before you.
[37:35.62]Alright, fine.
[37:36.02]I'll just pop you up.
[37:41.36]Okay, you actually killed me.
[37:44.96]You slow burned that until my character had a visible, audible, awful death and then had to respawn.
[37:51.79]Okay, what do we need to actually do?
[37:55.66]They got to 1,000.
[37:56.28]Alright, they did it.
[37:57.44]We have to free the firefly.
[38:00.10]Put the firefly into this bug zapper.
[38:02.70]It's going to open the Twizzler, and then we got to put all the little presents.
[38:07.24]Turn me into this.
[38:07.82]Turn me into that.
[38:09.78]Alright.
[38:12.80]Is it easier for me to tell you or visualize?
[38:15.62]Turn me into this.
[38:17.34]Like that.
[38:18.96]Pop out, pop out.
[38:20.08]I didn't even do that.
[38:21.10]I want to do that.
[38:22.68]That's fine.
[38:24.16]That's good enough.
[38:27.32]I'm gonna get down here like Mr. Potato Head, and I'm gonna press the button.
[38:29.98]Alright, so that opens it, so now you gotta get that in there.
[38:33.28]Alright, but we keep pushing them.
[38:36.02]So I can push you like this, I can shove you, and that works.
[38:38.79]There we go.
[38:39.05]Congratulations.
[38:39.81]Alright, so now that it's free, we have to get it back into the bucket.
[38:41.91]Now that it's free, come back over here, and I'm gonna give you a snip, and you're gonna collect it.
[38:45.91]Alright, by the way, are you gonna say that again?
[38:47.81]Just, I'm gonna, so you, okay, cut.
[38:49.23]A snip.
[38:50.31]Oh, really?
[38:50.91]So cut, cut me here.
[38:52.35]I'll clip you.
[38:53.81]You have to use the official terms.
[38:55.31]Snip.
[38:55.75]That was in the contract.
[38:56.91]This is snipper clips.
[38:59.05]This is not clipper snips.
[39:01.16]It's snipper clips.
[39:02.28]You give me a snip, I give you a clip.
[39:04.16]That was in the terms of the contract.
[39:06.48]Stop doing that.
[39:07.66]No, you fucking buddy.
[39:11.24]You fucking buddy.
[39:13.49]Now he's out of reach.
[39:15.31]You made me a fucking hockey stick.
[39:17.37]Just wait.
[39:21.05]I got a turn.
[39:21.81]He's right there.
[39:22.75]He's right there.
[39:23.31]Up, up, up.
[39:23.81]Get me up.
[39:24.19]You jump.
[39:24.97]Get me up.
[39:26.07]Get me up.
[39:26.83]You almost got him.
[39:27.77]Got him.
[39:28.45]Alright.
[39:28.83]Now push him over there.
[39:29.77]See?
[39:30.01]I knew what was going on the whole time.
[39:32.32]Come on.
[39:32.62]Jump up.
[39:33.18]Let him go.
[39:35.02]Let him be free.
[39:35.60]He's going to fly up.
[39:36.30]Alright.
[39:36.50]We have to do the thing where you're trying to get a bug out of a cup.
[39:38.52]Alright.
[39:38.84]So come over here.
[39:41.34]There we go.
[39:42.10]He's just sliding on up.
[39:44.25]Okay.
[39:44.57]Now I'm going to slowly...
[39:46.89]Move him this way.
[39:47.61]Mm-hmm.
[39:48.85]And by that point, the bug... Jump up.
[39:51.10]Okay, here we go.
[39:52.60]Don't do that!
[39:53.56]Oh my god, what are you fucking thinking?
[39:55.62]Just what?
[39:57.74]Did he do it?
[39:58.14]He's intentionally doing this.
[39:59.80]To try to, like, make, like, a point of the stream where, like, he's fucking it out.
[40:03.61]I'm gonna get angry!
[40:04.83]And I'm gonna start to say bad words.
[40:08.70]What can I say?
[40:09.24]I mean, I have single-handedly won at least 7 out of 10 of these.
[40:14.74]That's fine.
[40:15.56]Give me the AI Clipper and see how good he does.
[40:17.64]I wonder how good he does.
[40:19.06]Can you even do it?
[40:20.80]No, because you have to control both Clippers.
[40:22.98]Alright, we got one more.
[40:24.08]This is the final.
[40:24.82]No, we got two more.
[40:25.32]Two more.
[40:25.56]We got a mountain.
[40:26.04]Two more than the final boss.
[40:27.36]Mountain time.
[40:32.72]This gets better the more you drink of it, I think.
[40:35.48]This tastes like a fake Christmas tree.
[40:38.66]yeah it does but I'm not sure in a good way that's okay because it's gluten-free everything's gluten-free nowadays don't you know that's like that's like the buzzword now
[40:48.41]Gluten-free is like saying you have zero trans fat now.
[40:51.57]Nobody has trans fats anymore.
[40:52.91]Yeah, except trans fat's bad for everyone.
[40:54.59]But nobody has, like, people still advertise zero grams trans fat.
[40:58.47]Like, motherfucker, nobody has it anymore.
[41:00.54]It's been 10 years since somebody has had trans fat in a fucking bag of potato chips.
[41:05.72]Why are you still putting it on the front of your fucking card?
[41:08.76]Stop sending me Christmas cards.
[41:10.34]I don't want them.
[41:11.20]I get like a fucking dozen of them every year and I look at them and I'm like, I don't fucking care.
[41:14.84]Oh, you took a picture with you and your dog.
[41:16.66]I don't fucking want those.
[41:18.96]Send me money!
[41:26.98]We did it!
[41:36.23]We did.
[41:37.19]That we did.
[41:39.73]So the next game, we're gonna move on from Sasa.
[41:42.31]There was only one level left.
[41:43.99]What, there was?
[41:44.51]Yeah, there was only one level left in this world.
[41:46.77]Like, let's at least finish the last level.
[41:49.39]Finish this.
[41:55.08]You know what I'm saying?
[41:57.14]I'm fucking, you know, just kidding around.
[41:58.38]Alright.
[42:00.38]Ready for the box.
[42:01.12]This is the boss level.
[42:02.00]This is the box level.
[42:02.76]Here we go.
[42:03.70]Not the boss level.
[42:04.86]I got one egg.
[42:05.50]We got to pass the egg.
[42:06.42]We got to pass the egg.
[42:06.99]Oh, this is going to be hard.
[42:08.03]Blue has to go to your side.
[42:09.85]So you're going to turn right a little.
[42:13.29]Yeah, but we... And then go right.
[42:16.77]We're definitely going to have to snip and clip.
[42:18.85]Do you understand?
[42:19.33]I don't think we're going to have to do that.
[42:21.95]Because watch, if you go fast... So just go fucking wicked fast right now.
[42:26.47]Go, go!
[42:27.09]Fast!
[42:27.51]Faster than that.
[42:27.99]Come on!
[42:30.93]Both our children died.
[42:31.96]They're both dead.
[42:34.82]Yeah, it's okay.
[42:36.44]Let's think about this.
[42:36.98]Let's create them both into like bowls.
[42:44.52]alright that's a that's a deep that's a that's not a ball that's as much as that is like a banana you can't eat off of a banana you don't use a banana you don't put like a sandwich it's gonna give you more centrifugal force when you're throwing the oh come on just for you have to just listen alright you've done a lot will you listen can you listen to me alright it's his turn it's my turn I have been like
[43:05.72]You know when you're little and you give your little brother the fake controller?
[43:09.72]Yeah, stand up.
[43:10.14]That's what's been happening this whole stream, and it's time to give little brother the big controller.
[43:13.04]It's time to give the little brother the controller.
[43:14.32]Okay, so here's what's going to happen.
[43:15.44]You ready?
[43:16.16]No, go down.
[43:17.33]You go down.
[43:18.45]You stay right there.
[43:22.95]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[43:23.99]Re-remake yourself?
[43:24.87]Mm-hmm.
[43:25.67]Go down.
[43:26.45]Mm-hmm.
[43:27.11]It's time for little Timmy to have the idea, alright?
[43:29.25]Mm-hmm.
[43:34.13]Okay, what I would like for you to do is come over to me.
[43:36.83]Okay.
[43:38.11]I'm there.
[43:39.39]Crouch down.
[43:41.98]And I would like you to... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[43:48.76]Mm-hmm.
[43:49.80]Cut it.
[43:51.64]That's how you make a fucking proper bowl.
[43:53.50]Okay.
[43:54.16]You understand?
[43:54.66]I understand.
[43:55.13]Okay.
[43:56.05]I understand.
[43:57.33]Now, make yourself... Again, remake yourself.
[44:01.67]All the way?
[44:02.37]Yes, all the way.
[44:03.27]Okay.
[44:04.30]Now, I would like for you... I am vertical.
[44:07.50]Which way do you want?
[44:08.89]Hold on, hold on.
[44:09.47]Let me think about this for a second.
[44:10.39]Because I want you to... Because I need to do the same thing to you.
[44:12.99]Because if I cut... I'm going to turn you into a square.
[44:17.17]I need you to be like this, too.
[44:20.98]Okay.
[44:22.34]How do you propose we do that?
[44:23.78]We don't.
[44:24.34]But, like, this is how you make a bowl.
[44:25.56]But what do you want me to do?
[44:28.59]Go down.
[44:32.64]Actually, kind of a fucking good thing here.
[44:34.72]Cut a little bit off the top side.
[44:36.02]No, no, no, no.
[44:36.42]So I don't have this, like, unibrow on top of my own.
[44:38.52]No, but that'll keep the egg from, like, bouncing up.
[44:40.40]It's too big to, like, fit in between the... I agree.
[44:43.52]I agree.
[44:43.84]The banks are too big to fail.
[44:45.06]So what would happen is, like, once you fucking close those banks down and make sure that, like, oh, the bankers, yeah, bail us out, government.
[44:51.54]Shouldn't be doing that.
[44:52.34]Close the banks.
[44:53.30]Get rid of the IRS.
[44:54.49]Get rid of the goddamn fiat system.
[44:56.35]We're going all crypto.
[44:57.41]You know what I'm saying?
[45:00.17]2009 jokes.
[45:00.57]Alright, let's go.
[45:04.54]What do you... Okay, just cut my unibrow.
[45:08.20]I love how, like, it's already, like, weird.
[45:09.93]Alright, let's go, uh... I can't, like, clip your unibrow.
[45:14.85]I can take off one of your eyebrows.
[45:16.33]Okay, that's better than nothing.
[45:19.91]2009.
[45:22.16]Okay, I can get the other side.
[45:25.18]I'm just gonna hold still and close my eyes.
[45:27.20]You hold still and close your eyes when, like, there's an idiot with scissors near you.
[45:33.03]Okay, so now we should be okay.
[45:38.09]Clip sideways.
[45:39.41]Oh, we can just do one at a time.
[45:40.87]I need a little bit of room, please.
[45:44.85]Dunk it in.
[45:48.31]Now come up.
[45:50.47]Tilt.
[45:56.43]I need a little more shaved.
[46:00.95]Why can't I just go like this?
[46:03.21]Alright, go.
[46:08.49]Alright.
[46:08.75]Progress.
[46:09.37]Just easy.
[46:10.13]Careful.
[46:14.99]Come on.
[46:15.63]Come on.
[46:16.92]Just roll it in.
[46:17.88]Roll it in.
[46:20.16]Now we just gotta go the other way.
[46:21.34]My turn.
[46:21.52]We don't have to do two at once.
[46:23.92]Start it off immediately.
[46:29.66]What are you doing?
[46:31.10]You're hitting the button again.
[46:32.82]Hitting the toggle buttons.
[46:33.96]Come on, rotate around.
[46:41.26]I already did.
[46:42.46]I did.
[46:45.61]Give it in there.
[46:46.17]Two.
[46:47.45]It's alright.
[46:47.91]This is exactly what I wanted.
[46:49.71]The fat end sticks out.
[46:52.15]So you can hand it to me.
[46:53.41]This is just like when you look at a fucking... It's like they draw it up in the manual.
[46:57.18]No, not in the manual.
[46:58.00]This is a zit commercial.
[46:59.32]This is like, you know, they show the close-up of the pore, and there's all the gunk there, and there's like the bulbous head that pops out.
[47:05.58]That's exactly what I was envisioning.
[47:06.98]Trypophobia alert.
[47:08.22]So here we go.
[47:08.96]Pop.
[47:09.72]See?
[47:09.88]We popped a zit.
[47:10.88]That's alright.
[47:11.36]That's alright.
[47:11.74]We gave a warning.
[47:13.48]What is trypophobia?
[47:14.99]You've never heard of trypophobia.
[47:16.47]What is trypophobia?
[47:16.97]Does that mean you're afraid to go on vacation?
[47:18.97]What the fuck is that?
[47:20.29]Trypophobia.
[47:21.17]Trypophobia.
[47:21.99]What is it?
[47:24.30]It's like, uh... It's hard to explain, actually.
[47:29.10]Okay, so you know like the video of like the mama frogs that have like a bunch of tadpoles and they come out of little pores on their back?
[47:37.35]It's people who can watch stuff like that, and then they have an irrational aversion to seeing those little pores get squished.
[47:48.47]You never heard of that before?
[47:49.57]No.
[47:49.75]I don't know what you're talking about.
[47:52.01]You're going to have to repeat everything I say.
[47:54.63]See, they know what I'm talking about.
[47:59.09]Forget about your... That was close.
[48:02.73]It made a head with an actual face, and now it's going to break.
[48:06.77]We had it right the first time.
[48:07.65]If you didn't have such fucking vacation phobia, we'd be fine.
[48:10.30]What?
[48:11.64]Alright.
[48:12.08]Go fast.
[48:12.48]Go.
[48:12.78]Fast, fast, fast.
[48:14.10]Yeah.
[48:14.80]That's not how it works.
[48:15.77]But it's got to be quick.
[48:16.43]I'm just going to skip you altogether.
[48:17.51]Watch this.
[48:22.27]I'm cutting you.
[48:22.73]It just fits too perfectly.
[48:24.07]Yeah, it does.
[48:25.39]Oh, good.
[48:26.49]That was a nice adjustment to the already working plan.
[48:30.19]It wasn't a working plan.
[48:31.04]To make me really smooth.
[48:33.00]Why are you doing that?
[48:33.74]Wait for me to turn.
[48:34.58]You're going to wait for me to tilt?
[48:38.94]What are you doing?
[48:39.56]I'm going to roll it off the top.
[48:40.82]What do you mean roll it off the top?
[48:42.08]It's not going to work.
[48:43.31]Come on, do it a little faster.
[48:44.89]It's not going to work.
[48:46.87]You cut me the wrong way.
[48:48.87]Reform yourself.
[48:51.24]This is the one you're supposed to be doing the whole thing of.
[48:53.30]What do you... How do you want me to stand?
[48:54.94]Like this?
[48:55.52]We'll just get you like this.
[48:57.08]Hold on, how about this?
[48:59.28]Okay, like that.
[48:59.80]Because now we can make a... Like that.
[49:03.47]And you can... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[49:04.67]Easy.
[49:05.33]Alright, come forward.
[49:08.83]Almost.
[49:11.35]Getting there.
[49:11.71]Getting there.
[49:14.31]It's too much of a cup.
[49:15.47]Like, cut the little sharp end off me.
[49:17.99]Okay.
[49:18.71]There.
[49:20.11]Now come down.
[49:22.53]I did not be a fucking fork, first of all.
[49:25.57]There we go, there we go.
[49:26.29]Wow, it worked.
[49:27.01]Okay, just roll it off the top.
[49:29.03]That's not, I can't, it's not a roller coaster.
[49:31.39]Roll it off, okay.
[49:32.99]There, there we go.
[49:34.03]There it is.
[49:34.59]Now just easily, that's not gonna work.
[49:36.69]You have to reform.
[49:37.87]It's not gonna work.
[49:39.25]It worked.
[49:39.53]I'm out.
[49:43.65]My shape sucks.
[49:45.85]Now we have to do that again.
[49:47.00]We're not done with the boss.
[49:50.03]Is there an undo button?
[49:52.19]There is an undo button.
[49:53.01]But we already got it.
[49:53.97]So you're fine.
[49:54.39]This is going to be way easier than the other ones.
[49:56.20]Undo that.
[49:58.40]Okay.
[49:59.86]Just go.
[50:00.66]Go.
[50:00.98]Tip it over here.
[50:02.60]We're almost like done with this game.
[50:03.74]We're almost moving on to the next one.
[50:04.78]We're almost moving on.
[50:09.44]How are you gonna get that over there?
[50:11.92]Yay!
[50:14.00]That's what I wanted.
[50:15.30]And he's got a, it's a baby.
[50:16.52]Look, he's got a bib on.
[50:17.74]He's got a bib.
[50:18.58]That's a little owl.
[50:19.52]It's a hooty owl.
[50:20.34]No, that's a baby saying yay in the tie chair, and that's a bib on.
[50:23.98]It's a professional owl with a bow tie.
[50:26.16]Oh boy, do you not know your fucking children.
[50:29.44]Like, you don't know what your, you don't know what your children look like.
[50:33.13]You ever had a child before?
[50:35.16]Three.
[50:36.16]So you know exactly what they look like!
[50:37.90]I got three... Uh... Eggs.
[50:42.65]Smashed.
[50:43.57]Uh, you wanna try that one again?
[50:48.65]How old is your oldest?
[50:49.65]My oldest what?
[50:52.67]Your oldest child.
[50:55.69]Uh... Well...

[51:31.70]Now you dip it over here.
[51:32.42]I'm trying to get some momentum, okay?
[51:35.39]That's what I'm trying to do.
[51:42.03]This is the last level, guys.
[51:43.91]It's almost done.
[51:44.99]There.
[51:45.41]That was the one.
[51:48.07]There it is.
[51:48.43]Boom.
[51:49.73]Now you gotta go the other way somehow.
[51:52.13]I will.
[51:52.45]Roll it down.
[51:55.43]Now I can get it.
[51:56.05]I can do it again.
[51:57.27]I'll get it.
[51:57.73]I'm gonna do it like a pinball machine.
[51:58.91]Ready?
[51:59.07]Watch this.
[52:00.28]My oldest child is nine years old.
[52:02.84]Pay attention to the game.
[52:04.36]I am.
[52:04.50]What do you want me to do?
[52:05.22]You just had an opportunity.
[52:07.66]You lost it.
[52:08.04]I'm passing it back.
[52:09.10]You know, you gotta pass it back.
[52:10.58]Look what I'm doing!
[52:11.40]Look!
[52:12.14]That was as good as I could do it.
[52:13.23]I was playing it so well, and you blew it.
[52:15.15]That was as good as I could do it.
[52:17.05]Because I'm going to get it to roll, and then watch this.
[52:18.81]Bingo.
[52:19.79]Schpanko.
[52:20.83]Now I have to cut you, because you're not in the right spot.
[52:23.57]So you go down like that.
[52:25.83]Okay.
[52:26.45]A little bit more.
[52:28.44]A little more.
[52:30.94]Now I gotta do this.
[52:33.95]Alright, we did it.
[52:35.01]Game over.
[52:35.35]We win.
[52:35.61]I think there's one more.
[52:37.11]Alright, there's one more.
[52:38.89]But we could probably... Just try it like this.
[52:41.13]That was a little extreme.
[52:49.28]Oops.
[52:50.62]A little extreme.
[52:56.40]I can just skip you, I think.
[52:58.36]You can kind of skip me.
[52:59.80]Okay, I'm going to play cool.
[53:02.16]Well, I wasn't ready.
[53:02.94]Do it again.
[53:08.88]Come on, skip me.
[53:10.64]I need the right movement here.
[53:15.21]Got it!
[53:15.91]Just on the wrong side.
[53:16.93]Come on, here you go.
[53:22.32]I feel like we're making a pasta.
[53:24.18]We're making an egg.
[53:24.95]We're just like flipping it in the skillet right now.
[53:27.77]Just put it down.
[53:29.71]Put it down, Daleks.
[53:30.69]Put it down.
[53:31.19]Making the pasta.
[53:32.13]Skipped.
[53:32.83]Alright, now.
[53:33.61]What do you want?
[53:34.05]How do you want me to roll?
[53:34.73]I don't know.
[53:36.05]I think I just used flat.
[53:37.29]Flatten out here.
[53:39.79]Now you should be able to.
[53:40.67]What?
[53:41.11]Oh, it hit the button.
[53:41.59]Why did you press the fucking button?
[53:43.69]You gave me so much shit for that.
[53:45.81]And then...
[53:49.98]We're almost done.
[53:51.44]I can taste it and then we're gonna play another game Just take it slow.
[53:56.28]Okay, just take it slow.
[53:57.26]You're kind of you're kind of rushing things a little bit Slow slow it down done next
[54:17.61]You might be able just to roll.
[54:19.23]You're pressing the button again.
[54:20.65]Gotta step away from the button.
[54:22.21]You have to turn down forever.
[54:24.15]You have to turn down for what?
[54:26.80]You have to turn down forever.
[54:27.98]There it is.
[54:30.38]Okay.
[54:30.92]A little more.
[54:33.22]You gotta go hard and then flip it up.
[54:34.88]I don't want to do that.
[54:38.69]Too hard.
[54:39.37]Done.
[54:39.77]Okay.
[54:40.45]We beat it.
[54:41.07]Done.
[54:41.77]We beat it.
[54:42.29]Time to move on to the next game.
[54:44.22]It is.
[54:44.70]But we, like, we completed a sizable chunk.
[54:47.76]This game's fun.
[54:48.32]This is a good game.
[54:48.78]It is a fun game.
[54:49.60]Is this, like, if you had, like, you and your dad, or, like, you and your son, like, you've got three.
[54:54.32]You and your dad.
[54:55.30]Because it's, like, if you and your dad want to play a game, or you and your son, or you and your little brother, or you and your brother, you and your sister, or you and your little brother, you know, whatever.
[55:03.32]This is a great game to check out.
[55:05.47]This is called Super Cuts.
[55:08.53]A Snip in Heaven by... What's the developer's name?
[55:12.07]I think Konami.
[55:12.73]This was the last game they made before they went to slots.
[55:14.65]This is Konami.
[55:15.61]It's named by Konami.
[55:18.28]And it is on sale for... How much is it on sale for?
[55:23.42]How much is the game?
[55:24.98]I want it at the casino.
[55:26.88]You can only get this game at the casino.
[55:30.64]I just want to see what the next level looked like.
[55:33.90]It's very clearly too difficult for us to comprehend.
[55:36.10]We're going to move on to the next game.
[55:38.12]The next game is... You'll see in a minute.
[55:46.01]Let's move this.
[55:47.15]That's my job.
[55:47.65]You're on camera.
[55:48.45]We're not off screen.
[55:50.71]You have to change the game.
[55:51.80]I have to change the game.
[55:52.76]That's my job.
[55:53.98]You told me when to stop.
[55:56.22]I'm going to mute because I forget what the game is.
[56:11.25]Yeah.
[56:12.03]Alright.
[56:12.39]Well, if you have a problem with that, you can go home.
[56:14.92]You know, if that's how you're going to talk to me on my stream, then, you know, whatever.
[56:19.12]Anyways, we're going to go.
[56:19.88]We're going to play the next game.
[56:23.54]Select it!
[56:28.39]Game was pretty fun to watch.
[56:31.13]Here it comes!
[56:33.49]By Harmonious!
[56:36.73]Fabled developers of I think one game.
[56:42.11]Oh no.
[56:42.43]Don't do that again.
[56:43.84]Don't, fuck it, that's a party foul part two.
[56:49.00]Of course it's Putty Pals.
[56:52.28]Oh boy.
[56:54.00]Putty Pals.
[56:54.50]I'm just gonna wipe it on your carpet.
[56:56.68]Good, do it.
[56:58.00]My carpet is a giant napkin.
[57:01.27]Press any button to continue, Putty Pals.
[57:04.17]I told you we have 45 games.
[57:07.21]This is gonna be a like 68 hour stream.
[57:10.31]They can count to a million then.
[57:11.59]Easily.
[57:12.11]Don't... They would just... They got done with that shit like five minutes ago.
[57:16.51]Alright, let's go.
[57:17.83]No, we're not nexting.
[57:18.85]No, give it a rest.
[57:19.49]We're not doing that.
[57:20.13]Yeah, this is a serious game.
[57:21.57]We're gonna play this as long as we just played the last game.
[57:23.80]Give it a rest.
[57:24.38]We're not nexting in this one.
[57:25.26]Give it a rest.
[57:26.58]Alright, ready up.
[57:27.44]Give it a rest, guys.
[57:28.66]Ready up.
[57:29.34]I did.
[57:31.28]See?
[57:31.60]New game.
[57:32.06]Haven't played this ever before.
[57:33.48]Next, next.
[57:34.14]This game is fucking stupid.
[57:35.27]Give it a rest, guys.
[57:44.88]Seems loud, but that's okay.
[57:46.06]Is it loud?
[57:48.86]Turn it down a little bit.
[57:51.24]Guys, give it a rest, alright?
[57:55.43]So Putty Pals is a game where you and your friend... You and your pal.
[57:58.63]You and your pal, for more instance.
[58:00.98]You work together, you throw yourself into walls, you... I believe the guy that designed Doom and... The game?
[58:08.30]Oh.
[58:08.86]No, the guy that designed Doom and... John Carmack?
[58:12.12]John... Yeah.
[58:14.46]Hey, hold my hand.
[58:16.06]What are the buttons?
[58:16.86]Wait, wait, wait.
[58:17.22]Come hold my hand.
[58:17.96]Move, jump.
[58:19.20]This is just teaching instead of jumping.
[58:20.10]I'm green, by the way.
[58:21.01]Yeah, I'm blue.
[58:22.27]Alright.
[58:23.59]Come hold my hand.
[58:24.88]No, not until the tutorial tells us how to do it.
[58:27.00]No, come hold my hand.
[58:27.74]Am I giving you the finger?
[58:32.94]It's a thumbs up!
[58:33.96]Alright, so we're looking for Putty Pals!
[58:35.92]Alright, jump.
[58:37.75]How do we go through?
[58:38.63]Let go of me.
[58:40.89]How do you jump in this game?
[58:42.35]It's just A. What are you doing?
[58:46.05]That's not... Hit A. Yeah, got it!
[58:50.73]Hooray!
[58:51.57]You have to get the green ones.
[58:54.91]This game is running very badly.
[58:57.07]Okay, I got the staff.
[58:59.00]Let fucking go of me.
[59:00.94]No more...
[59:04.56]If you had just held onto my hand, you wouldn't have fallen into the lava.
[59:07.64]See?
[59:08.70]I just saved your life.
[59:09.90]I am not happy with you doing this, by the way.
[59:13.86]Look what happens when you let go.
[59:15.66]You fall in the lava.
[59:16.54]Alright, you can't step on the blue one.
[59:18.88]Catch me.
[59:19.72]No.
[59:20.72]Good job, you did it.
[59:21.62]Alright, so I gotta get the blue.
[59:25.48]Green.
[59:25.90]Alright, you died, so I have to go back.
[59:29.63]Hold my hand.
[59:30.31]Come here.
[59:33.46]That was like a Dario moment.
[59:35.84]How do I hold your hand?
[59:37.16]It's B. Okay, come here.
[59:40.08]Don't let me fall.
[59:40.92]Alright, we gotta like swing each other.
[59:43.40]Alright, you ready?
[59:45.43]Come here.
[59:46.67]Hang on, hang on.
[59:47.39]I don't need you.
[59:48.27]I don't need any of this.
[59:51.87]How about we, if the game hasn't, we don't need to do that.
[59:53.83]Just jump.
[59:54.17]This is still the tutorial.
[59:55.44]Just jump from, just collect your green... ...trunchberry and let's go.
[60:00.22]Trunchberry?
[60:01.18]Your trunchberry.
[60:03.30]What is a trunchberry?
[60:04.53]This is like the Zumbinis.
[60:05.83]Alright, I can go through... You can go, no, you have to go to the bottom.
[60:11.41]Let go of my fucking hand.
[60:13.67]So I can fall through that.
[60:15.02]No, wait, can I?
[60:15.72]Yes.
[60:16.46]Shit.
[60:16.94]How do I get up there?
[60:17.44]You gotta get yours.
[60:18.34]Trampoline.
[60:19.30]Hold on.
[60:20.28]Hold hands.
[60:20.98]No, you turn into a trampoline.
[60:23.76]See?
[60:25.00]What is that sound effect from?
[60:26.24]Is that Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo?
[60:28.78]They fucking probably stole it.
[60:29.98]That's Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo.
[60:31.98]And look, give it a rest, okay?
[60:33.06]Because this game was probably made by like one guy.
[60:35.60]Give it a rest.
[60:36.60]Hold my hand.
[60:38.44]Swing me.
[60:39.80]No, just stand still.
[60:40.74]Just stand still.
[60:42.84]I'm swinging.
[60:45.54]You are like swinging from my dick right now.
[60:47.76]Like this does not look good.
[60:49.22]I don't like how that looked.
[60:50.24]That did not look good.
[60:51.74]This is not one of those games.
[60:54.20]How do I like throw you?
[60:54.70]How do I get up there?
[60:55.59]Oh, you gotta trampoline.
[60:56.17]Oh, you're gonna trampoline me.

[61:01.58]Who cares?
[61:02.24]Alright, get over there.
[61:04.19]Now I can follow you up.
[61:06.05]Drag me over.
[61:07.31]Ah, beautiful.
[61:07.97]Putty pals!
[61:08.73]This is a good teamwork game.
[61:10.25]And there's a Super Meat Boy.
[61:11.11]Oh, you have to actually aim it.
[61:13.57]It's a whole jump button down.

[61:19.70]Nice, good catch.
[61:20.50]Alright, merge.
[61:25.77]Okay, so now I get to grab you.

[62:14.29]It's too much.
[62:15.21]Give it a rest.
[62:17.16]I have to get you up there.
[62:18.62]Help, please.
[62:21.89]Give it a rest.
[62:25.63]It really is just too much.
[62:27.48]Oh, I forgot to get my special Crunch Berry.

[62:30.52]You're going to get that one?
[62:31.62]Alright, volcano destroy.
[62:37.99]I hope the boss is enough.

[62:59.00]Alright, here we go.
[63:00.54]Yeah, go ahead.
[63:04.26]Putty pals!
[63:05.32]Putty pals!
[63:05.74]Alright, what does this mean?
[63:10.42]Apparently that hurts.
[63:14.34]We both have to be honest.
[63:16.34]I don't understand.
[63:19.86]What's going on?
[63:22.15]Come back over.
[63:22.83]I don't know.
[63:23.95]Let me just stand on your head.
[63:27.65]Are you pressing that button?
[63:29.65]Yeah, it's the one that holds hands.
[63:32.77]See?
[63:33.07]Why is it saying to go back?
[63:34.09]Alright, get off.
[63:36.32]Slingshot.

[63:46.71]So joyous.
[63:48.93]It's fucking... I'm not leaving this game yet.
[63:52.62]No, we're not done with this game.
[63:53.98]This is an actual video game here.
[63:59.48]Look at the world.
[64:00.08]It's a big overworld here.
[64:02.00]Alright, we gotta beat level 1 too.
[64:04.54]Then we'll move on to the next one.
[64:05.34]Does that sound good?
[64:07.99]Seconds ago.
[64:10.13]Literally seconds ago.
[64:11.27]I just bit my lip and it was a stupid idea.
[64:14.28]Anybody, you guys, anybody else do that?
[64:16.31]No.
[64:16.69]You're the only one.
[64:17.71]I, like, bite my lip down here and, like, it's just like, ah, fuck!
[64:21.12]No, I have to bounce off you.
[64:23.10]Easy.
[64:28.24]Alright, throw as fast as we can.
[64:29.70]Like, I'm done with this game.
[64:31.48]So, let's go.
[64:32.40]You just said, I'm not done with this game.
[64:34.27]But, like, this is a game that you would want to play with your fucking brother, your sister, your dad, you know, either one.
[64:38.67]So, I... You gotta wait for me.
[64:40.09]You just have to get both.
[64:41.07]You have to jump.
[64:41.81]It's a blue... So, here, just springboard.
[64:44.38]Look, watch.
[64:44.78]Ready?
[64:45.00]Watch.
[64:46.74]You're pushing the wrong button.
[64:47.70]You have to jump.
[64:48.68]Jump off of me twice.
[64:50.12]I gotta get the green floating in the air.
[64:51.80]Yes, you do.
[64:52.02]So you jump and get the green, land on me, get the green, land over there.
[64:54.58]So you forget the jump button.
[64:56.04]What is the jump button?
[64:57.30]The jump button is A. I was pushing A. You obviously weren't.
[65:00.60]There was a delay.
[65:02.06]You can do that.
[65:02.58]I jumped as far as I possibly could.
[65:04.16]Yeah, that's better.
[65:09.20]I gotta do the fucking Earthworm Jim game.
[65:10.86]You actually have to help me.
[65:15.96]Nice job.
[65:18.62]Alright, go.
[65:19.10]This game's only on the Switch, by the way.
[65:23.80]Is it?
[65:24.14]Yeah, I think it is.
[65:25.92]Now we're going the wrong way.
[65:26.84]Try again.
[65:28.42]Only on the Switch.
[65:29.38]I need more steam.
[65:32.65]You have to wait for the steam.
[65:36.13]Just wait.
[65:36.71]Go.
[65:37.31]Why?
[65:37.67]What was wrong with that?
[65:41.85]You have to wait for the steam to boost you up.
[65:56.08]I don't fucking even need you.
[65:57.02]Alright, go.
[65:59.04]You have to go.
[66:01.87]You have to help me!
[66:02.73]The steam doesn't go that far!
[66:04.39]Look, I'm up here.

[68:47.16]The whole thing.

[69:20.99]No.
[69:23.51]Level, uh, the second level's too long.
[69:25.93]Is this the second level?
[69:27.21]Oh, I guess it is.
[69:28.59]I think we're almost at the end, you impatient gamer.
[69:31.23]Come back here and get this blue.
[69:32.39]You gotta get the green!
[69:40.00]Share the enthusiasm of your putty pal, okay?

[70:23.23]It's kind of warm in here.
[70:24.51]Hey!
[70:24.69]It is, turn this off.
[70:26.11]It is a little bit warm in here.
[70:27.92]It's gotten hot in here because we put the AC on.
[70:31.24]Put the AC on a little bit too high.
[70:32.98]Hey, what do you say we change that game?
[70:37.78]Tell me, you don't want to 100% complete all these Switch games?
[70:40.60]Now we're going to play the real game that everyone's going to can't wait to watch because it's fucking stupid.
[70:45.08]I was trying to figure out what you were talking about, but then I remember.
[70:47.22]Sweat check.
[70:54.75]That's a shadow.
[70:55.43]I got a little.
[70:56.13]That's a shadow.
[70:57.47]I got about that much.
[71:02.55]Look, it's hot in here, and like, we're playing the Switch.
[71:05.20]Sometimes when you play the game, like, it takes a lot out of you.
[71:09.64]Is this one?
[71:11.33]No.
[71:12.33]That one.
[71:12.57]This one?
[71:13.07]That one.
[71:13.57]Okay.
[71:14.19]Alright, you guys ready?
[71:14.87]I gotta change the fucking YouTube title.
[71:18.26]Gotta change, like, the metadata.
[71:22.61]This one's the real game.
[71:24.53]The reason why you're all here.
[71:26.59]Is this even on Twitch?
[71:27.51]Hey, hey, read what it says.
[71:29.27]Hang on, hang on.
[71:29.91]Don't switch the scene yet, okay?
[71:32.23]I can't... Listen.
[71:34.08]This is not on Twitch.
[71:35.40]They already know what it is.
[71:36.76]No, they don't.
[71:38.14]Alright, don't switch the scene yet.
[71:39.40]I'm not going to switch the scene, but I have to change the title of the game to this name, but I... That's not the name.
[71:48.19]Where is it?
[71:50.39]Type it in differently.
[71:54.83]I already did it.
[71:55.29]Wait, wait, wait.
[71:56.39]That's not it.
[71:59.31]I kind of just want to... I think I'm just going to pick that.
[72:02.07]It's not on here.
[72:06.18]It's not on here.
[72:07.22]Even if I do it this way.
[72:14.84]Technical difficulties will be with you shortly.
[72:18.02]Yeah, this shit ain't even on Twitch.
[72:22.76]It's gonna get warmer in here in a second.
[72:24.68]It is, actually.
[72:25.16]We should, like, open a fucking window.
[72:31.36]Alright.
[72:31.70]So, you want me to change the scene?
[72:34.47]When do you want me to change it?
[72:35.89]Right now.
[72:38.43]Be mindful of your surroundings and other players while playing.
[72:40.45]So don't, like, break everything.
[72:42.85]Oh, God.
[72:44.75]Hey.
[72:54.33]We're not going to be able to do this.
[72:55.99]It's going to be a little difficult.
[72:58.44]We have to stand really... Okay, let's explain something here first.
[73:02.22]There's not a lot of room.
[73:03.62]Look, we have to explain something here before you do say anything.
[73:06.20]Right now, we have split the audio.
[73:09.10]The audio is split going into this, right?
[73:11.16]Yeah, this is as much room as we have.
[73:12.74]We both have headphones plugged into this because we have to split the audio so we're not echoing.
[73:17.11]They can't be speakers, you know, because otherwise you'd hear the game twice.
[73:20.01]So, we have to stand like... Yeah, we have to be able to hear the game.
[73:24.93]And play the game.
[73:25.73]We're connected at the hip right now by like a ball and chain.
[73:29.20]And we're wearing like the same color shirt.
[73:30.92]Who cares?
[73:32.28]We're part of the Ninja Turtles.
[73:34.64]Alright, you fly up.
[73:36.26]Do you have a fly?
[73:37.24]Is my fly up?
[73:38.26]I don't got a fly.
[73:38.84]We're good.
[73:40.58]Alright, here we go.
[73:42.45]This is not going to work.
[73:43.81]At all.
[73:43.99]I'm going to have to like back all the way.
[73:46.09]Maybe you can play some of these games like sitting down though.
[73:48.97]Also, you... What?
[73:52.13]We have to be like back here.
[73:55.69]To start, we need two players.
[73:57.54]Do we need two players?
[73:58.64]Grab a Joy-Con.
[73:59.90]Okay, how about I... Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[74:01.02]I got an idea.
[74:01.48]I got an idea.
[74:02.28]I got an idea.
[74:03.50]Wait.
[74:03.76]Hold on.
[74:04.64]That's me.
[74:05.16]Bear with me for a second.
[74:06.10]Hold on.
[74:06.66]I'm on the right side.
[74:08.36]The towel looks like... Make... Dance for me.
[74:10.97]No, don't dance.
[74:11.49]Don't do it.
[74:11.81]Don't do it.
[74:12.09]Don't, don't, don't, don't.
[74:12.79]Don't do it.
[74:13.19]Don't.
[74:13.49]Please don't.
[74:13.99]I'm just doing what he's doing.
[74:15.13]Don't dance.
[74:15.51]Everyone will make fun of us.
[74:17.34]See, I had to do what he did to get the okay.
[74:20.34]What was the fucking... You were the left player.
[74:23.01]Hold on, we need to do this.
[74:25.97]I'm not doing it yet.
[74:34.65]Oh, we're like split cam?
[74:35.61]We're going to do the split cam, right?
[74:38.14]What side of the screen am I on?
[74:41.16]I'm supposed to be on your side and you're supposed to be on my side.
[74:44.84]We can switch controllers.
[74:45.78]I'm already over here.
[74:49.33]I'm going to mirror the camera.
[74:51.41]So if I go like this.
[74:53.05]You have to do what she's doing on the screen right now.
[74:55.55]OK, well, hold on.
[75:01.17]Also, the volume seems really quiet.
[75:03.56]So probably turn that up.
[75:04.52]It does.
[75:04.70]Try shaking your Joy-Con.
[75:06.62]So hold on.
[75:06.96]Shake your Joy-Con.
[75:07.74]So she's using her right hand.
[75:09.46]Don't bump the mic.
[75:11.98]So I got to go like this.
[75:13.20]Here.
[75:16.00]Is that good?
[75:16.62]I just turned up like 10 decibels.
[75:17.90]Alright, well, get back on your camera.
[75:21.54]Try shaking your joycon.
[75:22.78]Alright, so here we go.
[75:24.16]Ready?
[75:24.38]So I, this is me.
[75:28.86]Do what she does.
[75:29.66]That might be too loud.
[75:31.04]Now it's way too loud.
[75:31.76]One, two.
[75:32.07]What are we doing?
[75:34.77]What are we doing?
[75:35.19]What are we doing?
[75:35.99]One.
[75:36.09]Something's going to fall.
[75:39.50]Quick draw.
[75:40.04]Quick draw.
[75:40.80]Quick draw.
[75:41.28]Check out this video to see how to play this game.
[75:43.18]How do we play?
[75:43.56]Alright, we gotta watch the tutorial first.
[75:45.08]Alright, let's see how to play.
[75:46.37]I'm gonna kick your ass in this, by the way.
[75:56.01]Okay.
[75:56.15]We're gonna, like, ram into each other's hands.
[75:58.15]Steady.
[75:59.99]Steady.
[76:00.47]We don't have to do what they do.
[76:01.85]It's just a tutorial.
[76:03.63]Fire!
[76:05.33]ZL.
[76:05.45]You have to hit the trigger.
[76:06.43]Which one is ZL?
[76:07.21]The trigger.
[76:07.77]This one.
[76:09.18]Okay.
[76:09.46]So I have to do this?
[76:11.70]I guess that's CL, right?
[76:14.48]Okay, so let's back it up a little bit.
[76:17.05]This tutorial is longer than the game.
[76:18.81]Alright, quick draw.
[76:19.69]Here we go.
[76:20.27]So I'm L, you're... I gotta... We are so attached.
[76:25.45]Wait.
[76:28.01]Here we go.
[76:31.71]Is this happening?
[76:35.83]Is this the game?
[76:36.35]Oh, you have to ready up.
[76:40.07]So good starters are ready up.
[76:41.91]They didn't mention that in the tutorial.
[76:43.37]Alright, look each other in the eye.
[76:44.73]I'm not doing that, because that's... Vise each other.
[76:51.94]Are we about to say it on balance?
[76:54.60]Ready... Steady...
[77:05.67]I think I died.
[77:12.44]Nice work.
[77:13.96].408.
[77:14.20]No, that was the difference of .0.
[77:16.84]I got you right in the thigh, right in the central artery.
[77:20.48]I hit you in the face.
[77:21.53]I shot you in the face.
[77:22.57]If I could live, if it went through my mouth, I'd be alright.
[77:24.77]But if I got you in the central leg artery, you'd be dead in about 10 minutes.
[77:27.69]Play again.
[77:28.61]Let's play again.
[77:29.51]Let's go again.
[77:31.17]This time try to be faster.
[77:32.49]This time stand back to back and then turn and fire.
[77:35.79]Alright, you have to turn, we both have to turn towards the computer.
[77:39.33]Okay.
[77:39.51]Okay, ready?
[77:39.99]Alright, ready?
[77:48.34]So when do we step forward?
[77:52.48]Look each other in the eye.
[77:54.80]That's not possible.
[77:57.57]Ready.
[77:59.55]Steady.
[78:04.53]Wait, hold on.
[78:05.12]I thought we were supposed to take like a step.
[78:06.50]Ready, set, fire.
[78:08.06]Try to be faster next time.
[78:09.34]I thought we were supposed to take like a step forward and then like turn around.
[78:12.78]Try to be faster next time.
[78:14.31]I thought we were supposed to take a step forward.
[78:16.15]Like we take a step forward and then boom.
[78:20.09]Right in the face.
[78:23.49]That one missed me completely.
[78:24.57]It's like, oh, whoopsie daisy.
[78:26.39]I don't know where, who cares?
[78:28.66]Oh my God.
[78:29.58]It definitely said back to back.
[78:31.54]It said back to back and then you're gonna take like a step and turn around.
[78:33.70]I thought it was gonna, do it again.
[78:37.48]Quick draw.
[78:38.22]Okay, this time I'm gonna get it in .2 fucking seconds.
[78:44.44]Ready for this?
[78:44.84].2 seconds.

[79:23.63]This is why you have the wrist strap.
[79:24.95]That was a fault?
[79:28.00]I frisbeed that directly into my computer.
[79:30.70]Alright.
[79:31.36]I'm not going to do that again.
[79:33.98]Facing down.
[79:35.00]Straight down.
[79:36.16]How much is a watermelon controller?
[79:37.96]Like $5?
[79:39.08]Steady.
[79:45.09]Fire!
[79:46.59]It got me again.
[79:48.43]He's trying to, okay, if this was a football game, you would have had a false start like twice in that game.
[79:53.38]I'd be like 40 yards behind.
[79:54.50]Point two.
[80:01.86]How we doing?
[80:02.62]Got any damage?
[80:03.20]How we doing?
[80:04.06]I got carpets.
[80:04.86]Any structural damage?
[80:05.96]Any structural problems?
[80:07.42]Alright, you win in this one.
[80:08.80]Except for the one time.
[80:09.66]One more time.
[80:10.58]No, we already moved on.
[80:12.76]Hey, he's actually scared I'll do it again.
[80:14.64]We already moved on.
[80:15.28]He wants to do another one.
[80:17.66]Whatever, I had like 45 minutes of Snipperclips superiority.
[80:21.28]Alright, this one's Zen.
[80:23.86]This one better not involve sitting down.
[80:25.32]Does this one involve throwing?
[80:27.01]It does.
[80:27.23]Oh no, I don't want to do this one.
[80:30.80]I don't think I want to do this one.
[80:32.50]We don't have enough room for this.
[80:33.60]We don't have straps.
[80:34.94]They want us to stretch all the way side to side.
[80:37.65]But we just proved why this is not a good idea.
[80:40.95]How are they going to know which, how, like... Alright, so I have to go this way then.
[80:47.09]What?
[80:48.27]You have to balance it.
[80:49.36]Stop!
[80:50.78]Oh.
[80:51.80]How do they know you're not just going to go like this?
[80:53.16]Zen.
[80:55.98]Okay, here we go.
[81:05.10]Face each other and take a pose.
[81:09.55]What are we doing?
[81:10.51]Change pose.
[81:11.13]I don't understand what he wants to do.
[81:15.17]Shake it.
[81:17.03]Face each other.
[81:17.63]If you insist.
[81:19.55]If you insist.
[81:22.09]Face each other and take a pose.
[81:24.27]That one's worse.
[81:25.41]Which one needs the controller?
[81:26.23]Which one's the controller?
[81:27.19]Is it up high?
[81:27.89]It's this one.
[81:28.89]So just hold it like this.
[81:29.65]Are we about to fusion?
[81:31.73]So you just go like this.
[81:34.03]Face each other and take a pose.
[81:37.17]I can't even touch my toes.
[81:38.32]I'm ready.
[81:39.28]Start.
[81:49.12]You're not even doing it right.
[81:50.58]You're just holding it forward.
[81:53.62]You're just holding it forward.
[81:57.41]I was just, like, showing the camera.
[81:58.85]Yeah, you're just holding it up towards the camera.
[82:01.55]Also, it clearly says, look each other in the eye.
[82:04.81]What is this replay?
[82:05.75]Is this a polygraph?
[82:07.25]Did I lie to you?
[82:10.03]Alright, new game.
[82:11.43]This game's stupid.
[82:14.51]The more red pepper icons you see, the more intense the gameplay will be.
[82:19.12]About to get a little spicier.
[82:20.54]I can't believe I fucking frisbee'd this into my computer.
[82:23.86]On the first game, too.
[82:24.74]On the first fucking game.
[82:25.87]The first one.
[82:26.87]Wait.
[82:27.91]Wait, I don't want to do this again.
[82:29.05]I picked the next one.
[82:30.71]Skip it.
[82:31.11]Are they showing us the tutorial again?
[82:34.21]Yeah, they are.
[82:34.89]Game select.
[82:35.27]Get us out of this fucking shithole.
[82:38.49]Samurai training.
[82:39.45]Alright, God.
[82:40.65]We can do this with two hands.
[82:41.63]Clearly, I'm the one on the left.
[82:44.00]Ready?
[82:44.48]You're the one on the left.
[82:46.08]Start.
[82:46.46]I'm, like, stepping on candy.
[82:47.76]What?
[82:50.21]Oh, boy.
[82:51.41]So you have to catch the... Switch.
[82:55.27]So I have to come down and you have to... Start.
[82:59.36]It's lightsaber versus lightsaber.
[83:00.70]You catch the...
[83:02.89]I get it.
[83:03.85]Okay, so you have to catch the blade or I have to catch the blade.
[83:07.13]Don't hit me in the head with my own switch controller.
[83:09.39]I'm going to do like the shit we... Stop throwing the switch controller.
[83:12.46]I'm not going to throw it directly into your face.
[83:15.58]Yeah, no, like right here on the small of my head.
[83:17.66]You're going to hit it right in the nose.
[83:18.68]Hold your Joy-Con in one hand and bring your hands together to catch the sword.
[83:21.52]I know.
[83:21.66]I have to catch the sword.
[83:22.84]Alright, so you hold it like this.
[83:25.29]They're both holding it like a... Whatever.
[83:27.35]Okay.
[83:29.47]We really need the wrist straps for these.
[83:31.33]It's alright, so who goes first?
[83:33.35]Left swings first.
[83:34.60]So I'll swing first.
[83:35.60]Ready?
[83:36.08]Okay.
[83:42.08]Start.
[83:42.62]I'm going right now.
[83:43.14]I need to do it right now.
[83:46.02]Swing from top to bottom.
[83:47.80]I didn't even do it.
[83:49.06]What?
[83:50.09]I timed that perfectly!
[83:52.65]Come on, that was cheating right there.
[83:56.47]Right!
[83:56.69]I caught the first one, clearly.
[83:59.90]You have to do a do-over.
[84:02.32]Guy doesn't even know how to use a Kendo stick.
[84:07.76]Why do I feel like this is... That was almost too close to call.
[84:10.76]Why do I feel like this is a thousand times worse than the Wii Remote?
[84:16.48]For this game?
[84:17.12]This is just like detecting extreme motion.
[84:19.82]So does an iPhone 4.
[84:20.52]Give it a rest, Nintendo.
[84:27.01]Hey, Nintendo didn't make this game.
[84:29.18]Left swings first.
[84:30.52]Again?
[84:31.28]Ready?
[84:31.78]I'm going to tell you exactly when, for real.
[84:33.76]For real?
[84:34.26]No fucking around.
[84:34.84]I'm going to tell you exactly when I'm going to swing first.
[84:36.28]Just see if it catches it.
[84:37.11]Yeah.
[84:37.31]Okay, ready?
[84:38.03]Give me a countdown, Mike.
[84:39.53]Okay, ready?

[84:46.62]One, two, three.
[84:52.24]No, I heard the fucking, the countdown started fucking me.
[84:55.28]I started the countdown, and it counted down to my brain, and like, it fucked me up.
[84:58.12]Do it again.
[84:59.20]One more time.
[85:01.51]Like, it was actually counting down, running out of time.
[85:03.63]And if I didn't do it at the right moment, I'd be in a class.
[85:06.89]Try it again.
[85:07.29]Okay.
[85:07.57]But it might be me, though.
[85:08.43]No, it's you again.

[92:53.42]Be sure to move your arms as you run in place.
[92:55.38]You guys have been training for fucking like 10 years to run a race and you decide that's more important?
[93:00.52]What are we gonna do with this?
[93:01.53]Alright, let's go.
[93:03.17]Run hard and raise your joy cones when you feel it vibrate.

[94:17.31]So you just have to punch.
[94:20.95]Don't punch me in the face for real though.
[94:23.07]We have to stay really close.
[94:24.85]We have to stay attached.
[94:26.29]With the umbilical cord.
[94:27.85]Like theater punching.
[94:29.39]Off to the side.
[94:32.01]So hook.

[96:13.47]Winner by unanimous decision.
[96:15.91]Yeah, by fucking two points.
[96:17.11]Blue!
[96:17.47]You won by two points.
[96:18.87]No, I don't want to play again.
[96:20.32]You pushed the button.
[96:22.64]I'm getting tired.
[96:23.60]We still got like over half the stream left.
[96:25.42]We got like 60 other games to play.
[96:27.24]Yes, we have like over half of the stream remaining.
[96:29.02]Oh well.
[96:34.18]Next.
[96:34.38]Alright.
[96:35.16]Now that you're warmed up.
[96:36.06]Did you push the button?
[96:37.86]What?
[96:38.33]What's it doing?
[96:42.15]Let's unlock all of the games.
[96:44.19]I like it.
[96:45.35]There are a lot of games.
[96:49.20]There's a fair number.
[96:50.90]We're going to be here for a while.
[96:52.40]Open that fucking window because it is hot in here.
[96:55.25]You can now play team battle.
[96:57.71]Join the right or left team and challenge your friends.
[97:03.22]I'm gonna shave now.
[97:03.94]Everyone say shave.
[97:04.60]You can now play Shuffle.
[97:06.54]When you're not sure what game to play, why not pick one at random?
[97:10.40]Have fun playing.
[97:11.82]Thank you.
[97:17.38]I can't grow a beard.
[97:19.62]I look like a scarecrow.
[97:20.84]Telephone.
[97:21.56]We'll do telephone first.
[97:23.02]Treasure Trust.
[97:24.67]We'll do Treasure Trust and then we're gonna do shave.
[97:27.07]And then we're gonna do telephone.
[97:33.68]A helicopter out here?
[97:34.69]Three, two, one, start!
[97:37.05]Careful!
[97:38.23]What is going on?
[97:40.27]I don't know.
[97:40.69]There are noises coming from outside.
[97:43.43]What do I do?
[97:44.31]Uh, we have to move the treasure chest.
[97:47.47]Alright.
[97:49.28]So move around the treasure chest, you told.
[97:51.00]Yes.
[97:51.66]I guess you want to lock?
[97:54.14]How's it here?
[97:55.22]That tutorial... I think we have to spin it around.
[98:01.72]Done.
[98:02.02]Okay, good.
[98:02.72]No more trap.
[98:03.45]So, we just have to spin around to find the entry point?
[98:07.03]Find the entrance?
[98:07.79]We have to unroll all the chain from that thing.
[98:10.49]Oh, okay.
[98:11.45]Sounds easy.
[98:14.69]We have to look at that.
[98:19.39]I got this, dude.
[98:20.89]You know how many times I fucking undone the twine on breath?
[98:30.97]It's a real pain in the ass sometimes.
[98:32.97]If you do it enough times, you've figured out the correct way to go real fucking quick.
[98:37.37]Wow, I did not even do them close.
[98:40.67]I've eaten a lot of bread in my life.
[98:42.35]Which side?
[98:43.01]This one again.
[98:43.97]This one again.
[98:49.01]Again!
[98:49.27]I'll do it again.
[98:52.01]Hold your Joy-Con sideways.

[99:39.63]You gotta bet a random generation.
[99:41.35]Do it again.
[99:45.37]You gotta bet a random generated number.
[99:51.27]Captain, hold your Joy-Con sideways and press a button.
[99:54.78]Check this.
[99:55.16]I had it the wrong way.
[99:56.42]I had it the wrong way.
[99:58.84]Not this time.

[100:44.86]Got no way to cut your losses.
[100:45.60]Fucking piece of shit game.
[100:47.74]Terrible fucking console.
[100:49.08]One good game on it.
[100:50.85]Hey, look, I made a Mario game and it was a 10 out of 10.
[100:53.49]Oh, yeah, another Mario game.
[100:55.27]Fucking terrible shit console.
[100:56.64]Put it in the fucking landfill where... Hello?
[101:08.02]Alright.
[101:10.90]I'm just kidding.
[101:11.35]It's a great console.
[101:11.85]I'm going to be pretty good at this game.
[101:12.87]It's a good console.
[101:18.01]Time.
[101:19.01]Share it with an electric.
[101:19.71]I'll be better than you at this.
[101:21.95]That was a you don't have to shave joke.
[101:29.05]Shave.
[101:32.91]Shaving contest.
[101:35.35]You should be on the right.
[101:37.37]The first player to shave off their entire beard wins.
[101:41.16]Press a button and get ready.
[101:42.80]Alright.
[101:48.44]This seems like incorrect.
[101:49.98]Yeah, this is not working.
[101:52.97]Move your Joy-Con gently along your face.
[101:54.77]It's not my face.
[101:55.63]This was my hair.
[101:56.45]I was going up to my hair.
[101:59.61]They made this technology fucking 10 years ago.
[102:02.06]Hold on.
[102:07.72]Face each other.
[102:08.40]Apparently fucking I'm ready.
[102:09.42]3, 2, 1, start.
[102:28.25]God damn it.
[102:30.85]Your fucking family will think this is real funny.
[102:34.21]When Aunt Edna, like, shaves out her, like, mustache and beard.
[102:37.35]Time.
[102:39.99]Ah, feels great.
[102:47.59]Actually, it did go down to my ass.
[102:57.15]I hope somebody's keeping track of how many more times I've won.
[102:59.65]It doesn't matter.
[103:00.48]You own this.
[103:01.02]This is your system.
[103:02.42]All I did was break your controller.
[103:04.04]Baseball.
[103:06.76]I hope someone is keeping a tally at home.
[103:09.36]It's not about winning.
[103:10.96]It's about being a non-licensed baseball team with no logo on your hat.
[103:14.43]Hey, they're wearing rings just like us.
[103:17.61]Yeah, this is brilliant stuff.
[103:19.91]Everybody wants to know.
[103:23.85]Alright, we'll do milk next, okay?
[103:25.98]We have plenty of time.
[103:30.82]Alright.
[103:32.20]Easy enough.
[103:32.78]Just Wii Sports Baseball.
[103:34.00]This is Wii Sports Baseball, but not as good.
[103:36.26]This is Wii Sports Baseball where you need to use like 80% of your imagination for the game to work.
[103:47.67]Well, I'll try not to break your monitor if you try not to break my controller.
[103:50.86]How about that?
[103:51.34]It's alright.
[103:56.99]It's the final inning and neither team has scored.
[103:59.94]Pitcher and batter face each other.
[104:01.66]Be mindful of your surroundings and stand far enough apart so you're not bumping into anything or hurting each other.
[104:06.12]I'm just ready to get, like, cold co-opted right in the mouth.
[104:12.76]Top of the ninth.
[104:13.96]The zero to zero.
[104:16.16]You have to hit the small one for the changeup and the big one for the fastball.
[104:20.77]Okay.
[104:24.05]Do something.
[104:24.83]Okay.
[104:27.97]Oh, I didn't know we were playing.
[104:29.25]You just have to use your imagination.
[104:31.05]This is not even a game.
[104:32.17]You've got to use your spatial sensitivity.
[104:34.62]This is literally just imagine you're playing a video game with a screen on.
[104:38.28]With sound effects.
[104:39.92]Alright.
[104:40.78]You ready?
[104:41.08]You're going to need the other headphone for this.
[104:43.32]That's fine.
[104:43.88]OK.
[104:46.88]What a hit.
[104:48.08]Double.
[104:48.94]Double.
[104:50.06]Oh, cool.
[104:51.08]That's right.
[104:52.58]Next.
[104:53.12]Oh, nice double.
[104:53.96]Next.
[104:58.82]That was a slow ball.
[104:59.80]That was like a... That was a... What do you call the... What's a changeup?
[105:03.80]No.
[105:04.24]But what do you call the... Ethos.
[105:05.74]Ethos.
[105:07.84]You can handle this one.
[105:09.78]Foul.
[105:10.82]I got it.
[105:12.48]What a hit!
[105:20.41]Double!
[105:21.23]Double!
[105:22.51]One point.
[105:23.43]Count them.
[105:24.25]I hate this.
[105:25.89]Keep going.
[105:26.77]This is not even a fucking fun party game.
[105:29.77]Crushed it!
[105:33.29]This is not $40.
[105:33.71]You get a home run.
[105:39.92]Better up.
[105:43.64]Don't go out the window, dude.
[105:44.60]I'm still pitching?
[105:45.22]Alright, he's coming in hot.
[105:47.14]Crushed it!
[105:47.44]Home run!
[105:56.86]So right now you're pretending, you actually are pretending way more than me.
[106:01.94]So you get more points.
[106:03.60]Like you're having like fun pretending to be playing baseball.
[106:06.77]I gotta pretend to play baseball.
[106:07.93]Okay, here we go.
[106:13.43]See, my imagination is stronger than yours.
[106:16.07]I think so, here we go.
[106:17.03]Fly ball!
[106:26.39]Still up four to zero on top of the ninth.
[106:29.75]We'll wait on this one.
[106:30.63]This one's going to be real fucking slow.
[106:34.36]It was.
[106:34.64]Oh.
[106:37.75]You have two pull-runs?
[106:39.23]Two doubles?
[106:40.13]Look, I'll take it!
[106:41.21]Imagine if you didn't have a facecam, this would be the fucking lamest stream I've ever done.
[106:43.63]Okay, my turn.
[106:43.99]Pull it up.
[106:44.33]Hit!
[106:44.51]There it goes!
[107:11.39]Strike.
[107:12.17]Change up.
[107:13.37]Yeah, sorry.
[107:14.09]Watch the strings.
[107:14.59]Yeah, that's fine.
[107:15.25]You're not wearing a fucking cord python on your neck.
[107:17.60]Let's move this and move that.
[107:19.92]I have to wear, like, this music video snake on my fucking shoulders.
[107:23.42]Alright, let's go.
[107:28.18]Crushed it.
[107:31.13]Off the wall.
[107:33.03]Ripple.
[107:33.81]Blue team scores.
[107:34.95]What?
[107:36.43]What?
[107:42.47]Why are you batting?
[107:44.41]Why are we... Fly ball!
[107:49.25]One out.
[107:49.97]No comebacks.
[107:50.75]Better luck?
[107:51.73]No walk-off homers.
[107:53.25]Stunned pretend video game.
[107:57.89]Straight!
[107:59.25]Fastball!
[108:06.68]Fly ball!
[108:10.31]World Series.
[108:11.43]Ready to bring it home.
[108:13.35]Nothing can quell my hatred for this game.
[108:16.43]One more, team.
[108:17.51]Come on, Reds.
[108:18.25]Just listen to the sound and move your arm.
[108:20.98]Oh, God.
[108:21.40]I fucking don't get it.
[108:23.66]Crushed it.
[108:25.80]Double.
[108:26.80]Luton scores again.
[108:34.15]Better up.
[108:34.99]That sound outside is fucking with me.
[108:39.28]I don't think I've ever played a game that was this bad.
[108:42.90]This is the worst game I've ever played.
[108:45.44]In my entire life.
[108:46.00]In my whole life.
[108:46.50]This is worse than Evil Within 2.
[109:05.73]keys on the rack, opening the case, putting in the case, shutting the case, locking it.
[109:11.31]Yeah, how about I imaginary like, let me like throw an imaginary like... Oh, drinking after a loss?
[109:16.92]Yeah, that sounds about right.
[109:21.32]We're doing milk and we're leaving this terrible fucking $40 game where you pretend to play a video game.
[109:29.09]No, we got baby, do baby.
[109:30.27]We're doing baby right now.
[109:31.35]This could make up for everything.
[109:36.72]You gotta be kidding me.
[109:37.92]Wait, do you have to actually pick up the whole Switch?
[109:40.36]Oh, no.
[109:41.74]Oh, no.
[109:43.38]This might need to be a full-screen game.
[109:46.43]This is scary.
[109:46.91]Do you have to pick up the baby?
[109:48.21]Well, you're gonna drop the baby.
[109:49.67]There you go.
[109:50.01]Don't drop the baby.
[109:51.27]Don't drop... This is the... Who made this game?
[109:54.09]I don't know.
[109:54.45]Why would you even have a chance for somebody to drop their fucking whole console on the ground?
[109:59.66]That's not cool.
[110:02.64]They're giving people a chance to drop the entire system on the ground.
[110:05.98]There's no, like, wrist holder for the entire Switch.
[110:12.41]Really.
[110:12.77]Just pull it out.
[110:17.19]Okay, but to be clear, there is not another Switch waiting in the wings for this baby.
[110:22.47]There's not another.
[110:23.41]Let's pull the baby out.
[110:24.71]This is really my Switch.
[110:25.77]This is real life.
[110:26.41]This is real life.
[110:27.24]This is a real Switch.
[110:29.76]Don't drop the fucking baby.
[110:31.24]God.
[110:37.21]Alright, here it comes.
[110:40.30]There's the baby.
[110:41.98]Can you even see it?
[110:48.24]So what do you do?
[110:48.88]I don't know.
[110:50.56]According to the picture, you hold it like this.
[110:53.22]Okay.
[110:57.59]This is so stupid!
[110:59.15]This is so stupid.
[110:59.93]This is stupid!
[111:02.95]Gently rock the baby to sleep.
[111:05.10]Don't drop the fucking console, Dan.
[111:07.06]Alright, three, two, one.
[111:13.62]Can you hear what... Shut up, Timmy.
[111:20.23]It's the third night this week.
[111:22.67]That's not how you parent.
[111:24.39]I'll show you parenting skills.
[111:26.13]I'll show you parenting skills in just a minute.
[111:28.49]It's okay.
[111:29.55]I know mama said you can't have any more food.
[111:31.63]This is fucking weird.
[111:32.95]Shut up.
[111:35.21]Timmy, please.
[111:40.56]He's going through dimensions.
[111:42.96]Timmy, please.
[111:44.86]Just love daddy.
[111:45.78]That's all I ever wanted from you.
[111:47.84]Stop screaming at the baby.
[111:48.92]You're screaming at the baby right now.
[111:51.34]Lower your voice.
[111:52.62]Shh, lower your voice.
[111:56.03]No, Timmy.
[111:58.33]You were almost asleep.
[112:07.08]Timmy, you're making daddy sweaty.
[112:14.23]What's up?
[112:17.23]Give me this fucking baby.
[112:18.59]Watch this.
[112:40.12]That's, ladies and gentlemen, how you put a baby to sleep.
[112:45.64]Gotta put the baby to bed.
[112:46.74]Can't just hold it up like Simba.
[112:50.62]You just dangled him out over in front of everybody.
[113:01.00]Ladies and gentlemen, that's how you put a baby to sleep.
[113:04.22]Put a baby to sleep on the table.
[113:05.44]That's how you put a baby to sleep.
[113:06.22]You gotta put the baby to sleep on the table.
[113:07.92]Can they even see?
[113:14.88]I can't even see it.
[113:15.64]I can't see it.
[113:17.40]He's asleep.
[113:22.45]It's so blown out.
[113:23.41]I wanna make sure people can see.
[113:25.69]Put it on the table.
[113:42.45]Too bad.
[113:44.27]Too bad.
[113:45.65]You scared the baby.
[113:48.47]Too bad.
[113:50.43]You scared the baby.
[113:58.55]Okay, so that was fucking fun.
[114:02.01]One, two, Mario Odyssey Switch.
[114:05.66]That's good.
[114:08.38]Put it back in there.
[114:10.66]I want the baby to love me too.
[114:12.32]No, no, no.
[114:12.60]Don't fucking do this shit again.
[114:13.62]I'm gonna sit down.
[114:16.70]I want the baby to love me.
[114:17.81]Cradle the Nintendo Switch console like you're holding a baby.
[114:21.89]I did.
[114:22.05]Let me drop it so people can actually see.
[114:25.15]It's really hot in here.
[114:26.89]Then set it down on a flat surface.
[114:29.44]Make it so they can see it.
[114:31.08]Pull it over here.
[114:49.91]How are you supposed to... How do you have a baby?
[114:52.25]You just gotta make it happen, man.
[114:54.43]Hold on.
[114:56.35]Timmy?
[114:59.53]Timmy.
[115:01.25]Come on.
[115:02.45]Come on, kiddo.
[115:05.94]I mean, I could take it from you and win.
[115:08.02]Hold on.
[115:14.34]He's thinking about it.
[115:15.87]He's getting tired.
[115:17.55]He's starting to tuck around a little bit.
[115:20.07]More arms, less body.
[115:30.81]Learning to be a dad.
[115:31.85]Okay, now put him down.
[115:32.96]He's asleep.
[115:33.26]Put him down.
[115:40.75]It took you 65 seconds.
[115:42.12]It took me 65 seconds.
[115:44.08]To get him to go to bed.
[115:45.30]Yep.
[115:45.64]Gentleness, A. Rhythm, F. Set down was a C. Set down was a gentle C. Alright.
[115:50.90]Let's do milk and let's move on.
[115:53.48]Unless we see another one we have to do.
[115:54.83]Turn the brightness back up.
[115:55.85]I will.
[115:57.87]Don't worry.
[115:58.39]I will.
[116:02.85]It's the fucking dumbest game.
[116:04.43]He's still crying.
[116:05.35]He's still crying.
[116:06.51]You just, like, put him in there and, like, sucked him into another dimension.
[116:08.96]Alright.
[116:10.04]So now... We're good.
[116:16.84]Okay.
[116:17.54]Back to it.
[116:18.02]Sword... No, I don't want to... Where's my controller?
[116:21.10]Which one was mine?
[116:22.60]That one.
[116:22.92]Alright, let's do wizard.
[116:25.10]Hang on.
[116:27.22]Three, two, one.
[116:28.54]Are you taking your shirt off?
[116:29.58]Wizard!
[116:37.55]Be mindful of your surroundings and stand far enough apart so you don't bump into anything or each other.
[117:06.80]Spin your Joy-Con to charge your wand.
[117:09.36]You go like this.
[117:14.60]When you hear the cue, thrust your wands at each other.
[117:19.23]Three, two, one, wizard!
[117:22.79]React to an opponent's thrust to counter-attack.
[117:29.31]You're over-thrusting, you're over-thrusting!
[117:38.25]This is a Kamehameha game.
[117:39.65]You're on your way to becoming a true wizard.
[117:46.69]Oh, I thought this was a tutorial.
[117:48.51]No, that was me kicking your ass, OK?
[117:53.00]OK, we'll do it again.
[117:55.12]Alright, we're locating too much time for 1, 2, 3, Switch.
[117:59.40]I mean, but if that's what the people want to see, then that's what the people want to see.
[118:02.18]Alright, what do the people want to see?
[118:03.10]You want to see 1, 2, 3, Switch?
[118:03.98]Or do you want to see something else?
[118:04.92]Because we've got like another 142 games.
[118:08.38]At least.
[118:10.56]Wizards!
[118:11.58]Milk, milk, milk.
[118:15.06]We will do milk before we turn this up.
[118:17.12]Be mindful of your surroundings and stand far enough apart so you don't bump into anything or each other.
[118:24.05]Spin your Joy-Con to charge your wand.
[118:26.35]Do we ever have to do this again?
[118:27.31]I need to get chapstick.
[118:28.61]My lips are too dry.
[118:31.85]When you hear the cue, thrust your wands at each other.
[118:37.39]So this is the last something.
[118:44.13]Are you just doing this?
[118:48.23]Be honest.
[118:48.87]Are you just doing this?
[118:50.31]You're up here and I was like, this is my stick right here.
[118:54.67]And I was like, wing, wing, wing.
[119:04.54]No sword fight, that's dumb.
[119:08.02]You gotta learn it by the box art.
[119:16.98]You just, like, read the book cover.
[119:19.52]Okay.
[119:20.02]We'll do the clown one.
[119:22.84]We'll do the clown one.
[119:35.05]Late spin.
[119:37.92]Okay, honest to God, hold on.
[119:41.04]That looks like if Shibby 2142 had clown makeup on and was making a clown.
[119:47.38]Doesn't that look like Shibby?
[119:48.58]Yes, it does.
[119:49.78]Like, if Shibby wanted to be a clown, he could, like, he could pull that off if he, like, really wanted to do that.
[119:58.40]It, like, really kind of does.
[119:59.60]What was, like, Goofy's...
[120:02.13]friend's brother's in-law's name?
[120:05.31]I don't know.
[120:05.83]What?
[120:06.33]Goofy's friend's brother-in-law's name?
[120:08.45]Like in the Goofy movie.
[120:10.24]Bluto?
[120:10.72]The bigger Bluto.
[120:12.32]Bluto.
[120:13.80]That's what the guy on the left looks like.
[120:15.02]Looks like Bluto.
[120:16.46]Be mindful of your surroundings.
[120:18.02]Alright, so we've got to be careful here.
[120:19.18]Spin.
[120:19.68]Spin the plate.
[120:21.84]Pete.
[120:22.67]Pete.
[120:23.19]Bluto.
[120:23.77]PJ.
[120:24.25]No, not PJ.
[120:25.51]Pete the cat.
[120:26.75]Pete the cat and Bluto the pirate.
[120:39.85]When your plate is spinning steadily, trace a circle.
[120:42.29]Spinning plates is great, but winning is better.
[120:46.87]When your plate is spinning steadily, stop moving your stick.
[120:49.77]I don't understand.
[120:51.69]I don't understand what the fuck even happened.
[120:53.47]Coming back.
[120:54.23]What the fuck, Shibby?
[120:55.19]Professional clown.
[120:56.25]I don't... None of that made any sense.
[120:58.84]Next.
[121:02.39]No copy dance.
[121:03.29]Milk.
[121:04.01]Milk.
[121:04.87]Milk.
[121:05.24]Milk.
[121:06.00]Not like Horatio Sanz.
[121:08.18]Like, go.
[121:08.94]Wait, go to runway.
[121:10.68]No, don't do that.
[121:11.32]It's five chilies.
[121:12.16]No, don't do that.
[121:12.92]Go, Eric.
[121:13.80]No dance off.
[121:15.28]I don't know what to do.
[121:16.83]I hate to gorilla.
[121:17.51]I don't know what this is.
[121:18.93]Do gorilla.
[121:19.97]It's just called gorilla.
[121:21.07]It's just gorilla.
[121:21.69]You just have, it's just gorilla.
[121:22.95]You're just gorilla.
[121:23.75]But it's a banana.
[121:43.83]This is just a proof of concept technology game.
[121:54.00]It is, yeah.
[122:13.48]But who cares?
[122:14.14]Gyroscope's been around for, like, 15 years.
[122:17.66]Make another WarioWare game.
[122:20.22]Holy shit.
[122:21.82]It's been, like, a decade.
[122:23.36]He's right.
[122:23.80]The last one was awful.
[122:24.56]Hold your Joy-Con and match the rhythm with both hands.
[122:28.17]Move your arms in the air like a gorilla.
[122:29.89]Move your arms in the air like a gorilla.
[122:32.13]Move your arms in the air like a gorilla.
[122:36.51]Hold your Joy-Con and match the... Whatever.
[122:40.15]Try making some gorilla noises.
[122:42.51]Hoo-hoo-hoo-ha-ha.
[122:53.61]Don't do it.
[122:56.39]Don't do that.
[122:57.35]Stop doing that.
[123:00.95]I gave it a kiss.
[123:06.35]Come on.
[123:06.69]I don't want to do this.
[123:07.55]It's like you put the... I didn't hear that one.
[123:10.55]You were talking.
[123:11.31]I couldn't hear that one.
[123:12.23]You guys made fun of me for being like... I couldn't hear that one.
[123:20.58]without hitting your chest.
[123:22.52]This is seriously, this is one of those games that you like, people that own like one game on a console, they fucking play, they play one game, they buy a fucking Wii for Wii Sports and they don't play anything else.
[123:32.46]They invite like four friends over and have like glasses of wine and play this stupid fucking gorilla game and they think it's hilarious.
[123:37.87]They think it's really fun and funny.
[123:41.22]You bring all your friends over and you share like a bottle of wine and you play the fucking gorilla game.
[123:45.34]Like, who the fuck does that?
[123:46.93]Tilt your Joy-Con and it will vibrate.
[123:48.63]Not us!
[123:51.01]Use the vibrations to try and figure out how many balls are in the box.
[123:59.03]Once you think you know the answer, pick a number.
[124:02.19]What is this?
[124:03.73]You don't know the answer?
[124:05.17]And set your Joy-Con down.
[124:09.84]That's the clown, by the way.
[124:11.10]That is the clown.
[124:11.72]That is the clown.
[124:12.30]That's the clown actor.
[124:16.27]What is it?
[124:16.71]Okay, so you do this.
[124:19.01]How many balls are inside of the Switch controller?
[124:21.57]Okay.
[124:22.19]That's it.
[124:22.51]Ball count.
[124:24.21]I picked the most boring-looking one on purpose.
[124:26.03]Oh, another, like, audio-only imagination game.
[124:28.21]Cool.
[124:29.43]Can't wait to fucking buy a system for this.
[124:32.22]Slowly tilt your Joy-Con left and right to feel the balls rolling around inside.
[124:39.57]Really?
[124:40.78]How many balls are inside the box?
[124:43.96]Use your control stick to guess how many balls are inside the box.
[124:51.37]Set your Joy-Con down once you've made your guess.
[125:09.53]Copyed my answer.
[125:10.15]Use your control stick to get... All set.
[125:15.35]You both got it wrong, so we'll call it a draw.
[125:18.34]Too bad.
[125:20.26]Ball count.
[125:21.26]I had to know what it was.
[125:22.80]Milk.
[125:23.86]Safecrack could be fun, but not fun to watch.
[125:26.34]Safecrack is definitely not fun to watch.
[125:28.58]Milk.
[125:28.78]How do you pick it?
[125:31.76]Today.
[125:34.02]Clown again.
[125:34.46]Alright, this is what everybody wants to see.
[125:35.98]This is what you stayed here for.
[125:37.49]This is why over 3,000 of you fucking stayed here.
[125:40.11]Yeah.
[125:40.85]To watch us milk a pretend cow.
[125:43.02]That's... I can't wait.
[125:46.69]Oh, we don't have the, I don't have the extenders.
[125:49.95]You're gonna have to push the buttons with your, with your, you're gonna like play an instrument.
[125:54.33]Okay, you gotta push the triggers with like your Two Fingers.
[125:57.47]Because I don't have the little button.
[126:00.24]That's alright, I can work with this.
[126:02.04]I'm sure you can do it with two hands.
[126:04.82]I'll do it with two hands.
[126:07.62]Milk!
[126:10.44]Okay.
[126:11.88]Got it.
[126:17.02]So we go face each other and get ready.
[126:21.78]Hold your Joy-Con and press the SL and SR button.
[126:25.98]Ready?
[126:27.97]Here we go.
[126:28.97]Milk!
[126:31.97]Look at your hands as you milk.
[126:38.45]How are you getting so much milk out of there?
[126:41.57]Something like Country Boy, City Boy doing a little bit better at the milk game.
[126:47.43]Why is there so much milk?
[126:49.60]Because I've done this a lot of fucking times.
[126:53.50]I'm essentially an expert at this.
[127:00.74]There was like four times as much milk on your side.
[127:04.17]How?
[127:07.87]I was pushing both of the buttons.
[127:09.39]There was nothing else in this game.
[127:11.19]Just push the two shoulder buttons.
[127:12.69]It's not about pushing the buttons, Etalyx.
[127:15.00]It's how rhythmic you're pressing the buttons and how much you're... Shut up.
[127:21.98]Let's not talk about that because that's going to get me in trouble.
[127:25.83]Why do you want to do this again?
[127:27.43]You really want to do this again?
[127:28.27]I don't understand the secret of the game.
[127:30.43]Okay.
[127:32.41]This is more of a knowledge and less of a rematch.
[127:34.63]You're, like, sliding.
[127:35.71]It's about sliding.
[127:37.45]You're sliding down and you're pressing.
[127:39.79]You gotta ease into it.
[127:41.55]I'm doing the same thing as you.
[127:49.71]And yours just... Look at you.
[127:54.19]It's like it's giving me tutorials.
[127:55.81]We'll get it if it uses that one.
[127:57.87]Obviously, it's not a skill player.
[128:03.54]It's only 20 cups.
[128:05.16]I think I might have won that one.
[128:15.21]Left win.
[128:16.88]Thanks for your help.
[128:17.66]Oh, whatever.
[128:18.38]I figured it out at the end.
[128:19.56]I figured it out at the end.
[128:20.56]Alright, the trick is you don't do both of them at the same time.
[128:22.70]You do the top one, and then the other one when the controller rumbles.
[128:29.46]See?
[128:29.58]You see how much I sped up at the end there?
[128:31.39]Whatever.
[128:31.93]So thanks for watching 1-2 for Switch.
[128:33.09]Thanks for watching 1-2 Switch.
[128:34.89]Wait, you know what?
[128:36.49]Might as well do...
[128:44.40]Soda Shake, the same game we've been playing the entire night.
[128:48.11]Yeah, but you do like, you pass it back and forth, see?
[128:49.91]It's a little more in control.
[128:51.87]So it's like you don't want to be the last person to get it.
[128:53.63]It's hot potato.
[128:54.90]It's just hot potato.
[128:56.94]I'm so uncomfortable.
[128:59.24]Why?
[129:00.92]We're milking cows.
[129:10.92]Cover your ears, everyone.
[129:12.10]Cover your ears.
[129:13.02]They might explode.
[129:13.80]No, cover, like, watch.
[129:15.34]Cover your face.
[129:16.49]Got it.
[129:16.85]I got that one.
[129:17.67]That one's won.
[129:18.03]Maybe that's on the left.
[129:21.25]No one has ever celebrated like that.
[129:23.53]Ever.
[129:25.15]It's just yours.
[129:26.87]So you shake it and you pass it.
[129:55.66]Cheers to that.
[129:57.22]I was looking.
[129:58.30]What's the point of this?
[129:59.88]Let's see what the point is.
[130:00.80]Alright, that was one, two, three, switch, everybody.
[130:08.15]Cheers.
[130:08.99]You want to go grab something?
[130:10.55]Probably time to go grab something.
[130:12.07]Go grab it.
[130:12.75]Are you ready to move on to a new game?
[130:15.93]Yeah.
[130:16.27]Alright, well, let's switch that over first, and then I'll go get something.
[130:18.63]Alright, let's just look.
[130:19.61]Give me the control.
[130:20.57]Hold on a second.
[130:21.39]Let's put it like the B.R.B.
[130:22.33]Scream at the B.R.B.
[130:24.54]Is this a double BRB?
[130:25.68]This is a one BRB.
[130:27.60]I'm going to change the game.
[130:28.79]Alright.
[130:29.21]But I have to change the game.
[130:30.33]And you are going to get us a bottle of champagne.
[130:32.23]We'll be right back in like two minutes.
[131:38.46]Alright, so this next one that we're going to play, let's move this down.
[131:43.16]Sorry.
[131:43.48]Hello.
[131:43.70]Hi.
[131:44.02]Hi, everybody.
[131:46.58]This needs to be moved.
[131:50.32]This is not necessarily a co-op game.
[131:52.14]We're going to explain this one in a minute.
[131:54.62]This one is a little different.
[131:56.78]Hold on.
[131:57.06]Let's delete this one.
[132:01.21]Sorry about that loud noise.
[132:04.07]Let's go ahead and reset this thing.
[132:09.07]How this game works... is we have... No, no more two cams.
[132:17.68]It's... Alex is coming back in like two minutes.
[132:19.88]So this game is... is a 30 minute game.
[132:23.19]There is literally 30 minutes to beat this whole game.
[132:26.51]We have to beat the whole game in 30 minutes.
[132:28.49]It's a... it's not a 99 cent Steam game, it's in fact a 50... like $15 game on Switch.
[132:34.73]So, when he comes back... Actually, I'll just start it.
[132:38.03]Fuck him.
[132:39.65]This is not the right controller.
[132:41.57]Or is it?
[132:47.21]Actually, might need him.
[132:49.54]Because I don't know how this works.
[132:50.56]I guess it is this one.
[132:56.20]This is a Resident Evil 1 clone.
[132:59.22]So, this could go either way.
[133:01.62]We have to beat this game in 30 minutes.
[133:06.08]Let's go to options first.
[133:10.00]What the fuck is going on here?
[133:15.64]Why can I not select this game?
[133:20.08]Where's Start?
[133:23.26]I actually need an adult.
[133:24.62]I need him here.
[133:28.12]Where's Start?
[133:36.69]Is it both controllers?
[133:39.81]What?
[133:50.58]Oh.
[133:52.28]Okay.
[133:53.70]I thought it was like... Okay, it's not two-player.
[133:55.16]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[133:56.42]What is CRT effects?
[133:57.86]We definitely don't want it.
[133:58.68]I don't want rumble features.
[133:59.58]Get the fuck out of here.
[134:01.31]Kind of brighten this up a little.
[134:02.83]Sound effects are maybe a little loud.
[134:06.56]That sounds good.
[134:09.05]Okay, let's go back.
[134:10.41]So, you know what?
[134:11.69]I'm going to wait.
[134:12.19]Let's wait for Etalyx.
[134:12.79]He's going to be here.
[134:13.79]We're going to switch off every five minutes.
[134:15.77]That's how this is going to work.
[134:16.61]Every five minutes, we're going to switch controllers.
[134:18.65]We're going to switch hands.
[134:19.53]And we're going to beat this whole game in 30 minutes.
[134:22.25]How's the hair?
[134:23.05]Terrible?
[134:23.79]Probably is.
[134:25.07]This looks real bad.
[134:27.73]We have to complain about our hair every stream.
[134:29.71]Don't you know how that works?
[134:32.99]Long P. He's actually going to get two more drinks for both of us.
[134:37.72]Oh, I can do bits.
[134:38.64]What the fuck am I talking about?
[134:40.30]I missed like a dozen of them.
[134:44.46]More than that.
[134:45.88]Holy shit.
[134:46.71]I missed a lot of bits.
[134:49.11]Thank you to Sir Feline for the $1.
[134:54.25]I'm still waiting on that rat painting.
[134:56.05]You better not disappoint me, Jeremy.
[134:58.18]Well, I'm not going to do a rat painting.
[135:02.03]Thank you, though.
[135:02.99]Much appreciated.
[135:04.71]Sam, thanks for the $4.
[135:06.24]Guess who's getting hopefully the last surgery on their leg in less than two weeks?
[135:12.10]Well, hopefully it goes well.
[135:13.22]Because that sucks.
[135:15.18]Any type of surgery and type of fucking medical problems is not fun.
[135:19.06]Hopefully it goes well for you, Sam.
[135:20.74]Anyways, I want to thank you and your community for helping me through this year.
[135:23.59]It would have been so much harder without you all.
[135:26.91]Well, Sam, thank you for being here as well, Sam.
[135:30.53]Thank you for being a trusted moderator on this channel for a long time now.
[135:35.51]Hopefully this is the last surgery you get on your leg.
[135:41.88]Everybody give your love and power to Sam.
[135:45.50]Because that's not a fun process.
[135:48.76]Absolutely not.
[135:50.48]But take care, Sam.
[135:53.14]We all are rooting for you.
[135:56.50]Also, thank you to Mr. Kang for the $1.
[136:00.08]T-Lot BB for the $1 as well.
[136:01.98]Where's the McDonald's coffee?
[136:02.97]I don't drink McDonald's coffee.
[136:03.91]What?
[136:05.29]And Trita, thanks for the $1.
[136:06.07]Yeah, but really, how is Italic so much more handsome than Jerma?
[136:16.58]I'm gonna let that one slide.
[136:19.80]Because he's a fucking guest.
[136:22.36]Thank you, entry, though.
[136:23.86]Sam, again, thanks for the 240.
[136:25.92]On a more serious note, I told my mom I was going to make a bike out of spaghetti.
[136:30.21]You should have seen her face when I rode straight pasta.
[136:33.95]Oh, lord.
[136:37.33]Alright, so who's knocking on the door?
[136:40.11]Why are you knocking?
[136:42.35]What do you mean your hands are full?
[136:46.61]What are you carrying in here?
[136:47.43]Like a fucking piano?
[136:48.39]What the hell are you doing?
[136:55.48]Okay, I guess he's got his fucking hands full of drinks.
[136:58.12]Alright, we're gonna change the title here.
[137:05.08]God, what the fuck are you thinking?
[137:07.44]You're a madman.
[137:09.36]Alright, this game is called Vaccine.
[137:11.04]Let's change it.
[137:11.92]Vaccine.
[137:12.66]That's it, right?
[137:15.10]This game is not a game.
[137:17.12]Yes, it is.
[137:21.03]Let's get that.
[137:24.25]I will catch up with the bits later.
[137:25.83]Thank you, everybody, for all your very, very, very generous fucking donations.
[137:29.17]Thank you, guys.
[137:30.90]Much appreciated, always.
[137:31.82]Alright, let's go back to vaccine.
[137:34.46]Here we go.
[137:38.39]It begins again.
[137:40.63]So I told them that this is a 30 minute game, and we have 30 minutes to beat it, and we've got 30 minutes, and I'm going to start, and we're going to switch off every five minutes.
[137:46.34]Switch off every five minutes?
[137:47.56]This is a local co-op game.
[137:48.58]Have you played this game before?
[137:50.58]No, this game's only on the Switch.
[137:52.04]Oh, yeah.
[137:52.66]Right.
[137:52.86]We're playing exclusive.
[137:54.44]This is exclusive on the Switch, local co-op, so we have to switch off every five minutes.
[137:58.61]I'm ready to go.
[138:00.59]Okay, here we go.
[138:01.69]New game.
[138:03.58]Hang on, I might, hang on.
[138:04.59]You might need to do this first.
[138:06.11]You might need to start first.
[138:08.29]Hang on, can you, uh, switch scene for a second?
[138:10.21]Switch scene for a second, we got it.
[138:14.56]Hey, look, remember that game we just played?
[138:16.64]With the soda and the champagne?
[138:19.25]What'd you do?
[138:19.55]I was just making sure that it was set up to be, like, one controller instead of two.
[138:23.55]Oh.
[138:24.11]Is that what the problem was?
[138:25.75]No.
[138:26.35]There was no problem.
[138:27.15]So, go... No, no, no.
[138:28.74]It's CR.
[138:29.02]I turned that off.
[138:29.66]I turned that off.
[138:30.50]Rumble feat.
[138:31.10]Well, you want Rumble, though.
[138:32.12]No, you don't.
[138:32.56]Rumble is the dumbest invention ever.
[138:33.96]It's a stupid feedback feature, biofeedback, that never made it anywhere.
[138:36.98]You turned it on.
[138:37.48]That's fine.
[138:38.36]New game.
[138:40.12]Alright.
[138:40.38]So, we gotta look at the skills here.
[138:41.98]Hold on.
[138:42.18]This is important.
[138:43.52]Do you want to begin?
[138:44.31]Age, 32.
[138:45.97]Fucking awesome age.
[138:47.23]Height, 1 meter, 82 centimeters.
[138:49.63]I think that's 5'8".
[138:50.11]What's 75 kilograms?
[138:55.32]This is all like metric nonsense.
[138:57.26]That's like 150.
[138:59.16]Cockroach.
[139:00.04]I mean, like... Let's be real.
[139:02.26]I kind of am a fucking cockroach.
[139:04.44]Determination.
[139:05.14]Stamina.
[139:05.54]Health.
[139:06.40]I think that's pretty good.
[139:08.14]That's me.
[139:08.74]Selected.
[139:09.75]Vaccine.
[139:11.25]It actually does the Resident Evil say the name of the title of the game.
[139:15.57]Well, this is a fucking homage.
[139:17.35]Vaccine.
[139:18.67]Alright, so how this works, you'll see.
[139:21.03]Your friend got infected again.
[139:22.77]Despite all your efforts.
[139:23.41]Happens all the time.
[139:24.63]Find the vaccine in 30 minutes.
[139:26.62]Or else.
[139:27.74]We'll find the vaccine.
[139:29.60]They die.
[139:29.82]30 minutes.
[139:30.06]Start the clock now.
[139:34.64]You might... He's shaking her up.
[139:40.26]We only have 30 minutes.
[139:41.20]You're suffering.
[139:42.68]I better hurry.
[139:43.44]Alright.
[139:44.86]The controls are really bizarre here.
[139:48.10]There's a watch on the ground.
[139:49.04]It's a Rolex.
[139:49.72]I'm picking it up.
[139:51.18]He picked up the knife.
[139:52.50]I put it in the menu.
[139:56.38]Combat knife.
[139:57.30]Okay.
[139:58.43]Equipped.
[139:59.55]Press A to stab.
[140:02.53]So you hold up the hands and then press A. Okay.
[140:05.09]Alright.
[140:05.73]So we can find the vaccine.
[140:06.91]We got a note.
[140:07.47]There's probably like some information here.
[140:08.67]That's a pencil, not a vaccine.
[140:10.85]I think I see Damon walking by in front of us.
[140:12.49]That rat.
[140:13.39]If I see him again, he's the reason.
[140:16.65]Got it.
[140:16.95]Just get out of this room.
[140:19.75]You've already burnt a full minute.
[140:21.71]It's a grandfather clock.
[140:22.89]It's very unnerving.
[140:23.67]Stop playing this like a pawn.
[140:24.73]There's probably something in the window.
[140:25.73]This is not a point-and-click adventure game.
[140:27.19]This is a fucking... It's too dark.
[140:28.71]I don't see anything.
[140:30.93]Gotta go outside.
[140:31.77]Can't wait till I get the controller in five minutes.
[140:33.18]You got one experience points for doing that.
[140:34.74]Go.
[140:34.84]There's probably something in here.
[140:38.70]What is this?
[140:39.12]Is this a... That's a wall.
[140:40.68]That's a weird, like, backstage entrance.
[140:42.68]Come on, go.
[140:45.87]Fire?
[140:46.49]There's a fire, there's a candlestick, someone's playing Puyo Puyo.
[140:50.71]Sarah's playing Puyo Puyo.
[140:54.08]I hope you win, Sarah.
[140:56.38]Go, go, go, go.
[140:57.68]I'm trying.
[140:58.86]This is going a lot faster than I thought it was going to be.
[141:01.70]I can't see anything in here, but I found a proximity mine.
[141:04.28]Alright, you know what to do with that.
[141:05.41]You need to use that on the zone.
[141:06.45]I'm going to set it somewhere you're going to forget where it is.
[141:09.27]I drank that the wrong way.
[141:10.31]Hang on, there's something on the ground over here.
[141:11.89]Is it gone?
[141:13.88]I don't know.
[141:14.46]Let's find out if I can bend over carefully and pick it up.
[141:17.38]You picked up a gun.
[141:18.26]I don't want to hurt my back.
[141:19.64]You got a clip.
[141:20.28]So I have to bend over very carefully.
[141:21.94]Keep an eye on where you are.
[141:22.64]Keep an eye on your surroundings because we're going to get lost.
[141:27.07]How big is this house?
[141:28.23]What a good experience for opening doors.
[141:29.75]It can't be that big because you only get 20.
[141:31.51]Can I change the camera?
[141:33.35]No, it's Resident Evil 1, 2, 3.
[141:35.25]Green crystal.
[141:37.69]Green crystal.
[141:38.39]Grab that.
[141:39.71]Tell me what to do.
[141:40.29]This is my fight place.
[141:41.71]Yeah, well, I can't wait until you hand that shit off.
[141:45.87]You picked up a chewing gum, thank you for that assistance.
[141:48.67]Probably gonna be able to rig some kind of MacGyver trap with a chewing gum.
[141:54.63]There's gotta be something like in the bed sheets.
[141:58.57]I wanna sleep.
[142:00.60]I wanna go to sleep right now playing.
[142:04.74]There's another shiny on the ground.
[142:08.40]You'll see.
[142:09.02]Just wait until you get the controller, okay?
[142:10.74]I know.
[142:11.12]You picked up a gold key.
[142:12.20]That seems really important.
[142:13.12]I know how to play Resident Evil.
[142:14.50]I was a big fan of Resident Evil 2.
[142:16.60]Leon Kennedy?
[142:18.36]Remember the guy you would go in the store in the very beginning?
[142:20.90]Who are you?
[142:21.98]And what are you doing here?
[142:23.10]The doorknob is broken.
[142:25.14]Find the doorknob and you can go through the secret door.
[142:27.87]Now, it's harder to keep track of where you are when they change the camera angle on you.
[142:32.79]Every single...
[142:35.23]Game music is way too loud.
[142:36.89]Turn the game music down.
[142:40.37]Options.
[142:42.27]Music.
[142:43.26]Turn it down to... Excuse me, I just sneezed.
[142:47.04]Turn it down.
[142:48.84]That's good.
[142:49.40]Right there.
[142:49.78]Is that good?
[142:50.40]Better?
[142:52.88]That works.
[142:57.18]Alright, you got like two minutes to figure this out before you go to me.
[143:02.72]She's gonna die.
[143:05.81]You don't do something about this.
[143:08.15]What am I... Give me a hint.
[143:09.45]I don't have any hints for you.
[143:11.53]Just explore.
[143:12.47]You have a gold key.
[143:13.83]I do have a gold key.
[143:14.63]Go back where you came from.
[143:18.68]I hear something.
[143:20.18]Something in this... It's a fireplace.
[143:22.50]I bet there's something in the fire.
[143:24.52]I would assume.
[143:35.12]Help me out here.
[143:36.24]You're going the right way.
[143:37.24]I don't need to help you.
[143:39.74]Chewing gum?
[143:40.84]Clip?
[143:41.58]I think you're going the right way now.
[143:43.44]Another... Why do we have so many proximity mines?
[143:45.65]Are there, like, things to... Don't.
[143:48.33]Watch out.
[143:49.29]It's a zombie, right?
[143:50.07]26 minutes.
[143:50.93]We have one life.
[143:51.95]Is that a zombie?
[143:52.97]Yes, it is.
[143:53.39]You have a knife, some chewing gum, and a first aid kit.
[143:57.11]Can you, like... What did you just do?
[144:00.42]You just put a proximity mine down.
[144:04.28]You can't walk by this room.
[144:05.54]But how big of a berth do I have to give it?
[144:09.68]Apparently, apparently... Come on, proximity mine!
[144:13.77]I think you have to step on it.
[144:15.91]Okay, that's one proximity mine gone.
[144:20.17]Now you have to stab this... It's gonna happen, just wait.
[144:29.19]He's right there.
[144:32.38]He stopped.
[144:32.68]Are you serious?
[144:33.96]He's standing on the mine.
[144:35.42]He can see the mine.
[144:36.97]Thank you.
[144:38.69]Thank you.
[144:39.13]This is fucking stupid.
[144:41.35]You have 47 seconds before I get the controller.
[144:45.85]No sound effect necessary for that explosion.
[144:47.81]There's no sounds for that explosion.
[144:49.89]No.
[144:50.57]No sound effect.
[144:52.09]We don't get sound effects here.
[144:53.97]Only the footsteps.
[144:55.94]You're going to walk on your own mind.
[144:57.40]I'm going to forget about that and walk over it.
[144:59.52]I put it in the corner, though, at least, so... Yeah, at least.
[145:01.80]There's another... Another one?
[145:03.08]Okay, I have to get the knife.
[145:04.02]I have the knife.
[145:05.02]Oh, just walk by.
[145:07.48]You don't have to kill everything, I don't think.
[145:10.12]Why would you have to kill everything?
[145:12.39]Another... Just barely got by that.
[145:18.91]Nice job.
[145:20.95]Nice work.
[145:22.53]Can they open doors?
[145:23.11]Are they smart?
[145:25.23]I guess doors don't even close.
[145:27.05]They stay open.
[145:29.02]You're not going to pick up the stuff on the ground?
[145:30.20]There's not enough time.
[145:31.10]My turn.
[145:37.53]No pausing.
[145:38.39]I paused so we can switch.
[145:40.35]No pause.
[145:41.17]Oh, sorry.
[145:41.65]Alright.
[145:42.87]What are the buttons?
[145:44.31]Exactly.
[145:45.61]Good luck.
[145:47.35]I've played Resident Evil 4.
[145:48.02]I know what the fuck I'm doing.
[145:49.22]Good luck.
[145:49.82]Alright.
[145:52.42]Is it?
[145:52.70]Yeah.
[145:53.08]And then A. You're about to be surrounded on two sides?
[145:56.10]It's alright.
[145:56.52]I'll get around it.
[146:03.05]How do you open doors?
[146:03.81]A?
[146:03.97]Mm-hmm.
[146:10.58]Okay.
[146:11.18]24 minutes left to figure out the... Good.
[146:17.46]I was supposed to see this guy!
[146:20.26]Oh my fucking god.
[146:21.92]Less than 30 seconds after I give him the controller.
[146:24.59]Do you see how dark this is?
[146:26.25]Do you even see this guy?
[146:27.45]This, like, fucking team... Keep going!
[146:30.81]How dead are we right now?
[146:32.01]I don't fucking know.
[146:32.79]We have 24 minutes to beat the game.
[146:39.90]Lollipops?
[146:40.68]They're selling lollipops.
[146:42.06]Good.
[146:43.20]It's another guy.
[146:43.82]A copy of a famous Greek statue.
[146:46.40]Which one?
[146:47.68]This guy or that guy?
[146:51.71]I'm so interested in this Greek statue.
[146:58.90]Hand over the controller.
[147:00.58]Oh, you can sprint?
[147:01.38]You didn't tell me you could sprint?
[147:02.32]I didn't know you could sprint.
[147:04.04]What is this?
[147:04.98]You are about to be eaten by a lizard man.
[147:08.10]There's a lizard man on the ground.
[147:09.48]He's hitting you.
[147:10.12]Where's the inventory?
[147:12.74]Alright, first aid.
[147:13.84]You're dead.
[147:16.49]You died.
[147:18.51]You see what you've done?
[147:19.17]You see how much better I did in my five minutes?
[147:22.37]Yeah, you dropped two proximity mines and walked around one zombie.
[147:25.73]I killed a zombie.
[147:26.51]Can you say the same?
[147:30.89]Zero out of ten.
[147:34.57]Next one.
[147:35.19]Go ahead.
[147:36.07]Get ready.
[147:36.75]I was assured that that was at least... Don't call me a cockroach.
[147:39.83]...a 30-minute joke.
[147:41.43]That's not a 30-minute joke.
[147:42.51]That game was just... That game was an eight-minute experience.
[147:47.90]Alright.
[147:51.08]Sorry.
[147:51.30]Alright.
[147:51.94]This is a good one.
[147:53.28]So... Sorry.
[147:56.26]My bad.
[147:57.68]So, of course, it's getting to the point where we're at the end of the year, right?
[148:02.57]It's December.
[148:03.85]So December is where you get to see some of the... Obviously, you start talking about the video games that are...
[148:09.71]some of the best in their field, right?
[148:10.95]It's like games of the year, right?
[148:13.47]And this one, in particular, is on that list.
[148:17.72]It released for the Switch this year, and it's a very, very, very great game, I think.
[148:23.34]It deserves to be on the list at any point in time.
[148:25.78]So if you go ahead and open that up, we'll show you what it is.
[148:30.63]It's a classic, and I think no matter how many times they remake this game,
[148:35.34]Yeah, I mean, it's game of the year.
[148:37.76]It's the game of the fucking year.
[148:39.02]Released on Switch again this year.
[148:42.83]It's a funny story how, you know, they release the game every fucking year.
[148:46.61]And the game came out like nine years ago.
[148:48.95]But for some reason, they keep... It's the game of the year, though.
[148:52.13]It's the game of the fucking year.
[148:54.60]You have to go through a lot of confirmation stages, I guess.
[149:00.47]It released this year.
[149:01.39]Oh, what's this?
[149:02.83]2D Boy.
[149:04.23]2D Boy.
[149:04.63]This game... What's this game?
[149:06.09]How many fucking confirmation?
[149:07.73]Give it to me.
[149:08.50]Give me this fucking thing.
[149:09.98]Hold on.
[149:10.42]It's coming.
[149:12.52]Why is this one the left one?
[149:15.44]I can't burn any more dead air.
[149:19.10]Oh my god.
[149:22.89]How does it know you're pointing at the screen?
[149:24.49]I'm left-handed now.
[149:26.55]Why am I left-handed?
[149:31.03]Oh my god, what's the confirm button?
[149:34.04]Here it comes.
[149:35.34]Presents?
[149:36.48]Hey, World of Goo!
[149:39.42]That would have been so much funnier if it happened right when I said it.
[149:42.19]Yeah, the game of the year.
[149:43.93]Game of the year, came out on Switch this year.
[149:46.47]Came out on iPad like last year.
[149:48.75]Came out on Steam three years ago.
[149:50.37]Came out on the PS4 two years ago.
[149:52.93]Came out on Xbox 360 eight years ago.
[149:54.95]Came out on Xbox One like a year and a half ago.
[149:57.91]Came out on fucking iMac ten years ago.
[150:00.41]They released a game every single year.
[150:02.05]And it's been a game of the year.
[150:03.49]Game of the year.
[150:03.91]No, it says game of the year.
[150:06.53]It says game of the year on the store page.
[150:10.73]Are we gonna play this game?
[150:11.75]Can they make another game?
[150:13.60]Honestly, World of Goo was a great game, but like... Does it have to be on every single fucking system ever every year?
[150:24.09]No, this game is great.
[150:28.19]It's a great game, but like the joke here is like, do they have to re-release this game fucking like nine times?
[150:33.75]This game came out like fucking 12 years ago.
[150:38.89]They did.
[150:39.27]Little Inferno and Human Resources Machine.
[150:41.29]Well, what?
[150:41.85]Come on!
[150:42.97]You gotta put this on every system ever made?
[150:49.35]But this one has motion controls.
[150:53.97]Why not?
[150:56.18]I don't know.
[150:56.58]Why not put everything on the Switch?
[151:00.22]It's too loud.
[151:00.82]Everything's too loud out here.
[151:03.46]I've actually never heard of this game.
[151:05.04]Well, this game's for you, because it's very good.
[151:08.63]It's very good.
[151:09.27]It was very good.
[151:10.19]It was very good when it came out in, what, 2007.
[151:13.11]Yeah, it was like a launch game with the Wii.
[151:17.03]Like the original Wii.
[151:18.21]This game came out for the original Wii.
[151:20.07]They've gone through like three Nintendo systems with this game.
[151:25.02]It like has to be on every new Nintendo system.
[151:27.72]Every single one.
[151:28.54]Is this on DS?
[151:30.20]It better be.
[151:30.62]Probably.
[151:31.02]Hold on, let me see.
[151:31.60]It's on iPad.
[151:32.32]It's on iOS.
[151:33.14]It's on every platform that's ever been made.
[151:36.31]If this is on DS, then this just proves everything.
[151:38.99]Is World of Goo on DS?
[151:45.22]That'd not be.
[151:50.36]No, it's not.
[151:52.32]Is it on PSVR?
[151:55.18]Alright, we did our joke, good.
[151:58.16]Move on to the next game.
[151:59.71]You were actually playing.
[152:01.15]I was actually playing.
[152:02.01]It's a great game.
[152:03.37]It's a pretty good game.
[152:04.37]It's game of the year.
[152:06.62]Can't wait for Skyrim to come out again.
[152:08.34]Yeah, let's go ahead and load that one up.
[152:11.98]What would you rather do?
[152:14.53]No, God, no.
[152:15.89]Not yet.
[152:17.21]I'm going to need like two more drinks to do that one.
[152:20.75]Okay.
[152:21.93]You might say that about this game after we get started.
[152:24.58]Probably.
[152:27.42]Good game, bad joke.
[152:31.31]It would have been good except they maybe orient both controllers for the game before we started.
[152:36.21]No, World of Goo is a fucking fun game.
[152:38.87]Windows feature update.
[152:40.31]Remind me later tonight, please.
[152:41.55]Get the fuck out of here.
[152:42.67]No, no, no.
[152:43.37]How about just... Remind me in three days.
[152:46.29]Alright, it's time to introduce our next game.
[152:49.00]It's a co-op classic.
[152:50.56]What do I click here, dude?
[152:53.33]uh pick a time restart not restart now snooze snooze remind me in three days snooze option right do like pick a time no it says snooze options remind me in three days snooze snooze if my computer turns off right now I swear to fucking god okay
[153:08.02]This next one is a classic.
[153:10.00]Actually, I've never played it.
[153:10.78]It's a co-op classic.
[153:11.38]It's a co-op classic.
[153:12.36]It's pretty much what you think of when you think a game that two people can play together requires teamwork, it requires coordination, it requires friendship most of all.
[153:21.69]Especially two friends who can come together despite their differences.
[153:28.09]This is fucking terrible.
[153:30.41]Where is it?
[153:33.50]Zero viewers playing this game.
[153:34.82]I wonder why.
[153:37.67]We're going to be playing, of course, the game called Troll and I. So I have to... I got to be the troll, right?
[153:45.04]So this essentially is The Last Guardian, except somebody plays Trico.
[153:50.25]This is pretty much how it works.
[153:51.23]Trico.
[153:52.77]Trico.
[153:53.29]It's Trico.
[153:53.99]Trico.
[153:55.59]Trico.
[153:55.99]Trico.
[153:56.64]No, it's Trico.
[153:57.58]Trico!
[153:57.86]Alright, just do it normal.
[153:59.52]Difficulty normal.
[154:00.66]I don't think we have an option.
[154:02.12]Oh, there we go.
[154:03.48]You do.
[154:03.80]Select it.
[154:04.88]Easy?
[154:05.16]Normal?
[154:05.64]Normal.
[154:05.98]Normal.
[154:06.42]Everything normal.
[154:07.06]Always normal.
[154:08.30]Never hard.
[154:08.82]Never easy.
[154:11.73]Link looks really depressed.
[154:13.93]How do I join the game?
[154:15.21]I think you're... That's a good question.
[154:20.53]Are we trying to skip this?
[154:21.85]I mean, you kind of can.
[154:22.84]That's Agent 47's voice.
[154:32.08]Niko, how are you?
[154:34.26]Oh, he let go of me here.
[154:35.74]He's ready to go bowling.
[154:36.76]It's good to see you still have that fiery determination, my friend.
[154:40.77]Come on, bowling joke.
[154:42.31]2004.
[154:42.99]Niko, this is why I called you here.
[154:46.57]2004.
[154:46.59]2006.
[154:47.47]Joseph Stalin dies.
[154:49.81]2006.
[154:50.57]No, no.
[154:51.37]Beneath that.
[154:52.81]You skipped it.
[154:53.89]I'm glad you did.
[154:55.29]Five years later, guys.
[154:56.71]We're moving fast.
[155:00.86]Alright, give me one of those Joy-Cons.
[155:02.24]Wow, second cutscene after the first one.
[155:03.98]Give me one of those Joy-Cons, please.
[155:05.46]Fours.
[155:07.62]Nice PSA game.
[155:08.84]Third cutscene.
[155:09.52]Alright, so how do... You don't get to play.
[155:10.62]I don't get to play.
[155:11.54]No, you're the... You are the troll.
[155:13.54]Alright.
[155:14.18]Hang on.
[155:16.48]Leave co-op.
[155:18.98]I gotta find you first.
[155:19.86]You're like... Did you pick two-player?
[155:22.82]I don't think there was an option to it.
[155:23.98]So why did it say leave co-op?
[155:28.21]It's a crafting game.
[155:29.39]It's a crafting game.
[155:30.63]Oh, no.
[155:31.13]Am I getting, like, resources right now?
[155:33.31]When the boar icon appears on the map, there are boars nearby.
[155:36.07]Oh, no.
[155:36.93]I have three sticks.
[155:40.83]Just get to the part where I can play the troll.
[155:42.57]I'm working on it.
[155:43.67]This is like a 4 out of 10 right now.
[155:45.52]Once I'm the troll, this is going to be like an 8.5 out of 10 when I get control of the troll.
[155:51.34]I'm just going to throw it out there.
[155:52.24]I'm going to warn you.
[155:55.49]I took too long.
[155:56.51]What?
[155:57.01]Start again, Otto.
[156:01.49]A boar.
[156:02.15]This smells like his bottom?
[156:04.09]Smells like boar.
[156:04.93]I thought you said smells like bottom.
[156:07.21]I gotta follow the tracks on the ground.
[156:08.96]You're gonna think you're gonna follow boar tracks.
[156:10.40]I'm gonna think I'm following a boar, but it's really you eating a boar.
[156:12.94]It's me.
[156:13.92]It's fine.
[156:17.38]You got eyesight there.
[156:18.92]Here, little boar.
[156:21.29]You're like smelling his shit that he shit on the ground.
[156:23.21]Am I going the wrong way?
[156:24.51]No, see, look at the mini-map.
[156:25.71]Watch the mini-map.
[156:27.44]It's a very clear as day radar blip on the map.
[156:30.98]What's the point of looking at the visuals?
[156:32.38]I'm on the right track anyway.
[156:33.64]That's for sure.
[156:34.46]Okay.
[156:35.22]There you are.
[156:35.74]Watch out for the anomaly.
[156:36.98]Watch out for the anomaly.
[156:39.34]Oh, no, no, no.
[156:40.34]You have to pick that up.
[156:41.90]That's bullshit.
[156:42.92]You gotta like smell that.
[156:43.80]Oh, it's stinky.
[156:44.77]Mm-hmm.
[156:47.73]Press A and then press B. Where are you?
[156:52.22]It's that way now.
[156:54.04]See?
[156:54.34]This is not good.
[156:56.78]You can sprint.
[156:57.66]Oh, I'm chasing him.
[156:59.42]That's him.
[157:00.28]Can you throw your spear?
[157:01.52]Hold on.
[157:02.18]He can hear me if I sprint.
[157:03.96]This is important.
[157:05.44]This is the important part of the game.
[157:09.49]I can hear him.
[157:11.35]You hear that?
[157:18.45]I know how much you hate this.
[157:20.96]Just get to the troll part and this will become at least a 7 out of 10.
[157:25.32]Throw the spear right in the head.
[157:26.26]Oh, it's moving.
[157:27.16]Just throw it directly.
[157:28.04]Oh, so even within two is a great game.
[157:29.96]Come on.
[157:30.70]I got him.
[157:31.12]No, you missed, actually.
[157:31.82]You missed completely.
[157:32.54]No, I didn't.
[157:33.04]Yeah, you did.
[157:33.90]That went, like, right in front of him.
[157:34.84]See, it's right there.
[157:35.32]You missed him.
[157:40.91]Boron Luke.
[157:43.41]Getting closer.
[157:44.65]Just get him right in his asshole.
[157:46.67]He sees you.
[157:47.25]He sees you.
[157:49.74]I got him!
[157:51.23]See?
[157:52.01]That was a direct hit!
[157:55.13]Don't sit here and tell me I'm missing when I'm clearly... Look.
[157:58.31]Well, he made an audio cue that time.
[157:59.95]It clearly was you hit him.
[158:02.59]You have to play for 20 minutes to get to co-op?
[158:06.04]That's it.
[158:07.62]A little.
[158:08.12]You taught me well, father.
[158:09.46]You taught me well.
[158:10.08]Just one more to go.
[158:10.86]I have to hunt more than one boar.
[158:15.22]You are more than just food, fine boar.
[158:17.59]This is not...
[158:20.28]This is not what he envisioned when he told me to buy this game.
[158:27.47]Hang on.
[158:28.55]Is it really 20 minutes?
[158:29.65]Because we're already like 10 minutes in.
[158:32.09]We skipped the cutscene.
[158:33.27]You have to get to the troll.
[158:34.41]You have to.
[158:35.29]That's the whole point.
[158:36.09]That's the entire point of the game.
[158:40.03]Entertain them while I play.
[158:42.59]What do you want me to say?
[158:44.29]Read some bits.
[158:45.55]That's a good idea.
[158:47.51]Good idea.
[158:50.01]Thanks for the idea.
[158:50.87]I'm on the right track.
[158:52.21]That's for sure.
[158:52.91]Hey!
[158:54.37]Come on, little boy.
[158:55.83]My family needs you.
[158:57.18]Hey!
[158:58.46]What have we got here?
[158:59.70]I'm not going to read the one about the handsome stuff because he's here now.
[159:03.82]Do you smell that?
[159:05.28]Smell what?
[159:10.44]That's your own breath blowing back into your face.
[159:14.06]Alright, so Sean, not Conray, thanks for the $1.
[159:17.30]Will we see Sean Saboteur in Jerma Rumble 2018?
[159:20.68]No.
[159:21.78]Why would we?
[159:22.26]That was a dumb character.
[159:24.54]Thank you to Great Head, or Greater Head, for the bits.
[159:27.46]These two quarters belong to Etalyx.
[159:29.96]Yes.
[159:31.10]So generous.
[159:31.88]I'll do you one up.
[159:32.72]Write that down.
[159:33.86]How about a diamond?
[159:36.52]That's for you.
[159:37.06]One more hit should do it.
[159:38.00]That's for you, buddy.
[159:39.04]Don't put it down my shirt.
[159:39.94]That's a diamond for you.
[159:42.54]Hey, My Uranium, thanks for the $1.
[159:45.92]Sparkier Hat, thanks for the $1.
[159:47.74]Dear Jerma985, thank you for being such a positive person and entertaining people rather than, rather it be through videos or live streams.
[159:55.63]Good luck on your future projects and good luck to everyone in chat.
[159:57.87]Well, thank you, Sparkier Hat.
[159:59.13]That's a really positive message to have.
[160:02.37]Thank you, appreciate that.
[160:06.48]What?
[160:08.08]Why was that funny?
[160:10.39]Oh, y'all, you're stuck forever.
[160:11.93]Okay, now I know why it's funny.
[160:13.39]Now I know why you're laughing.
[160:14.41]Because you literally can't move.
[160:15.87]Moving around like this makes too much noise.
[160:17.93]You get the fuck out of this.
[160:19.21]Because I... You get... Just, like, aggro the bear.
[160:25.26]Aggro the boar and let him kill you.
[160:29.64]What the fuck did you do, man?
[160:30.80]Like, how did you get in this one spot?
[160:33.20]How did you get there?
[160:35.32]It just happened, man.
[160:37.58]Hey, Red Ranger, what's up, dude?
[160:38.66]Thanks for the 10 bucks, Red Ranger.
[160:42.03]If you guys want to know something funny, here's a little tidbit of information that I'll tell you about.
[160:47.44]You fucking idiot.
[160:50.08]Go ahead, do it.
[160:50.82]Do it.
[160:50.94]No, wait.
[160:51.34]I got it.
[160:51.90]Okay.
[160:52.26]I was going to say, you dug this grave.
[160:53.48]You dug this grave.
[160:54.10]You dig us out.
[160:54.64]Saved.
[160:55.92]So you can attest this.
[160:57.30]You were here.
[160:58.02]Your family needs you.
[161:00.04]So I did a meetup at TwitchCon, right?
[161:02.88]So TwitchCon.
[161:04.08]TwitchCon.
[161:04.84]Meetup at TwitchCon.
[161:05.84]Hey, I'm out here.
[161:06.80]Jerma985.
[161:07.54]Here I am at TwitchCon.
[161:11.71]Red Ranger was the only person that showed up.
[161:17.72]At my, like, Twitter meetup for TwitchCon.
[161:20.69]What was the only... Yes, but like... There was one other person.
[161:25.33]There was two people that showed up to my, like, Twitter meetup.
[161:30.05]And it was fucking... Red Ranger, thanks for coming to my meetup.
[161:33.85]And thanks for the 10 bucks as well.
[161:35.77]Hopefully you had some good food.
[161:36.92]What was that?
[161:37.58]Time to play.
[161:38.08]Time to play.
[161:40.34]Give me the control.
[161:41.52]Time to play.
[161:45.36]You're over there.
[161:46.12]I gotta run across the sky for you.
[161:50.41]Mother...
[161:51.68]It's mom.
[161:52.16]It's me.
[161:52.44]I'm your mom.
[161:53.36]The troll is the mother.
[161:54.84]But, no.
[161:55.26]Thank you, Red Ranger, for the ten bucks.
[161:57.21]I think you're going to get some QTEs here.
[161:58.65]Hopefully you don't fail me.
[162:00.77]I can't see.
[162:01.37]I might dreadlock through my eyes.
[162:02.75]Oh, Otto.
[162:03.77]Whoops.
[162:04.03]I feel like you're going to get, like, your head's going to get crushed.
[162:15.30]Here come the QTEs.
[162:17.72]Easy, so far.
[162:18.56]Don't fail them!
[162:19.36]I thought you failed that one.
[162:24.28]It's the same button.
[162:28.64]So far, it has been the same button.
[162:31.11]B. B. I'll keep reading bits while you play this terrible, boring shit game.
[162:38.61]But thank you, Red Ranger.
[162:39.47]Thanks a lot, man, for the ten bucks.
[162:41.71]Forest Ornament.
[162:42.93]Thanks for the one doll.
[162:51.48]What did you do?
[162:52.12]Did you fuck up the QTE?
[162:54.88]Did you not press B at the right time?
[162:57.46]What do you want from me?
[162:58.58]What do you want from me?
[162:59.31]Perfection?
[162:59.91]You're supposed to be getting us to the fucking co-op part of the game.
[163:04.95]It's okay, I got a checkpoint.
[163:05.83]I got a checkpoint.
[163:09.27]Thank you, Forest Ornament.
[163:13.80]11-day stream incoming.
[163:14.78]Not true.
[163:15.46]Thank you.
[163:16.92]Ghost of Muliz, thanks for the five bucks.
[163:19.49]Hey Jeremy, your stream title says friend.
[163:22.09]Fiend instead of friend.
[163:23.29]I'm not sure you realize this.
[163:25.40]Also accurate.
[163:28.18]Switch a fiend in me.
[163:29.26]What do you mean?
[163:30.88]You don't think that is accurate?
[163:32.88]Switch a fiend in me.
[163:35.08]I am a fiend.
[163:35.70]You're kind of a fiend.
[163:38.98]Anyways, thank you though.
[163:39.97]Thanks a lot.
[163:41.81]Also, thank you, Leferl.
[163:43.01]Thank you, Fator, over the bits as well.
[163:45.66]Gnostic, thanks for the $1.
[163:46.48]I'm in disbelief right now.
[163:50.30]How many?
[163:51.88]There's so many.
[163:52.98]You're literally the only person that keeps me on Twitch.
[163:54.82]Thank you for doing what you do and making me laugh through the last week.
[163:59.49]Thank you Gnostic.
[163:59.89]We're gonna need some more bits here.
[164:01.45]Because I am still pushing B. I think I just finished.
[164:04.35]Are you done?
[164:05.59]Thank you Gnostic though.
[164:06.35]That's really nice of you to say.
[164:08.23]Do I get to play now?
[164:09.85]Hold on, I want to watch this one because it could be... I need immediate feedback.
[164:13.06]Give me, give me!
[164:16.56]There's the troll.
[164:22.94]Don't skip this cutscene.
[164:24.60]It's time to do Trigo.
[164:26.22]Oh, wait, give me... Wait, wait, wait.
[164:35.95]Give me the controller, man!
[164:37.93]I need the other controller for that!
[164:40.09]It's supposed to be Koa.
[164:52.52]You died.
[164:56.12]Where was I supposed to go?
[165:00.89]Where was I supposed to go?
[165:03.75]There was nowhere to go.
[165:04.83]There actually wasn't, like, anywhere to go.
[165:08.80]Oh my god.
[165:09.46]That's fucking funny.
[165:12.86]Don't do it again.
[165:13.86]I'm not trying.
[165:14.76]This is not intentional.
[165:17.27]Look, I'm playing Steve Aoki right now, okay?
[165:24.36]I'm Steve Aoki's Neon Dream.
[165:28.24]This game is $30.
[165:28.78]This game, I think it was $30 or more.
[165:31.24]It was $30.
[165:31.68]Alright, my turn.
[165:34.02]Here it comes.
[165:36.83]Wait, that's not me.
[165:37.35]That's not you.
[165:40.55]Oh, you got it on your side.
[165:41.37]Okay.
[165:42.85]What is that monster?
[165:44.29]Look at the dinosaur trog.
[165:50.81]I'm gonna wipe my fucking mouth!
[165:53.27]Ah, it's his stick.
[165:55.82]Let me take his stick.
[165:58.20]Better than the spear on my back.
[165:59.72]That was not even sharp.
[166:02.04]The spear is sharp.
[166:03.56]Alright.
[166:05.28]You can have this.
[166:06.28]You control the movement on that one and I'll control the camera and the buttons on this one.
[166:11.31]No, you hold it the other way.
[166:12.27]Like this.
[166:12.85]This is still supposed to be just me, but you control the one side and I'll control the other.
[166:16.07]How do I move?
[166:18.12]They can't see my other hand.
[166:19.74]Move the camera.
[166:22.84]Just put your right hand up.
[166:25.61]Act like you're playing.
[166:26.91]Here's what we're going to do.
[166:29.83]Ready?
[166:30.31]You come over here.
[166:31.93]Move to the left a little.
[166:32.57]I'm going to be off screen.
[166:35.26]Make this a little bit easier.
[166:36.34]Why are you going to be off screen?
[166:40.14]I'm the streamer now.
[166:41.84]You do this, ready?
[166:44.24]Hey, it's me, Jerma.
[166:45.72]No, just hold on.
[166:47.20]What, implying that I'm, like, a drunk?
[166:48.58]What are you talking about?
[166:49.74]Well, guys, like, uh, is there any more?
[166:52.40]No, no, don't, don't, no, no, no, no, no.
[166:55.72]Just let me, can we do this fucking stupid job?
[166:57.55]There's not enough!
[166:58.53]Just, wait, ready?
[166:59.95]Alright, so put, make sure your left arm is not seen.
[167:04.75]Okay, so here's your other hand.
[167:07.49]Like, right here.
[167:08.31]Now, open the inventory.
[167:09.37]Okay, go ahead, what's it?
[167:10.75]Alright, that works.
[167:14.82]What are we looking for?
[167:15.72]We're looking for the boar meat, which is one to the left.
[167:21.30]Don't work.
[167:21.88]One to the left.
[167:22.55]There you go.
[167:23.89]And then we replenish our health.
[167:25.27]Oh, don't push me.
[167:25.91]Okay.
[167:28.19]Now push X to enter crafting mode.
[167:30.61]Okay.
[167:31.57]Alright.
[167:31.99]We're, of course, crafting.
[167:33.01]We need a metal tip spear.
[167:35.59]What does it want me to do?
[167:36.81]Navigate to the jawbone club.
[167:38.07]Okay.
[167:38.17]You're going to hit left over here.
[167:42.49]Oh, it's one too far.
[167:46.86]Wait, maybe not.
[167:48.66]Keep going.
[167:52.56]You just look like a fucking idiot.
[167:55.32]There it is.
[167:55.90]There it is, alright.
[167:56.56]Press the button.
[167:57.12]Okay, yeah, I'll just get out of the way.
[168:01.04]I'm like really itchy.
[168:03.16]Put your hand up!
[168:03.96]Sorry, sorry.
[168:04.60]Hold on, there we go.
[168:05.52]I'm just like really like itchy.
[168:07.52]Go on, play.
[168:11.00]Alright.
[168:14.29]You're like got an itch on your chest!
[168:15.73]Yeah, I do.
[168:18.16]My nose, like, I think there's something in my nose.
[168:22.90]No, it's in the nose.
[168:24.39]It's in my left nostril.
[168:26.07]You can't even see me!
[168:35.11]Alright, can we move?
[168:36.11]There's like a boar up there.
[168:36.99]I can't fucking even see, dude.
[168:38.25]Alright, see the red dot?
[168:45.45]We're moving forward.
[168:47.68]Alright, come to stop.
[168:48.60]Stop, stop, stop, stop!
[168:49.62]Hold the left trigger.
[168:54.76]We don't have any more.
[169:00.15]How do I?
[169:00.83]Move!
[169:02.75]That's a different hand!
[169:04.19]Alright, we need more like... How do I use... Oh, there we go.
[169:10.74]Run up to him.
[169:15.46]Done.
[169:16.12]Easy.
[169:17.83]Vile creatures.
[169:20.51]Can I fucking play yet or what?
[169:23.42]Go to the checkpoint.
[169:25.34]Okay.
[169:27.24]Vile creatures.
[169:29.08]Is that a Dark Souls reference?
[169:30.52]I don't know.
[169:31.84]You're looking backwards.
[169:32.74]You did something.
[169:35.46]Keep going.
[169:36.57]Can I take this back now or are we still doing this joke?
[169:38.75]We're still doing this.
[169:41.87]Other way.
[169:42.67]Oh, oh.
[169:46.94]Okay.
[169:47.60]Cloud berries, of course.
[169:49.14]Classic.
[169:53.03]Why are you talking to your other hand?
[169:57.51]Let's go get some more spears.
[170:00.15]It looks fairly convincing, actually.
[170:02.39]Okay.
[170:06.06]Checkpoint is this direction.
[170:09.48]Wait, we're here.
[170:10.48]Take this.
[170:10.74]No, no, no.
[170:10.98]Put this hand down.
[170:16.46]Like, hold the other one up.
[170:17.40]Yeah.
[170:26.34]Like, hmm.
[170:27.64]What's happening here?
[170:29.66]I was doing, like, the I'm doing something.
[170:31.72]Like, I'm thinking.
[170:37.90]Press... What is that button?
[170:41.84]What button does it tell?
[170:42.89]Minus?
[170:43.91]I don't know why the fuck we're still doing this.
[170:47.42]Increase Otto's voice range by 10.
[170:50.20]Bought it.
[170:53.45]We're almost there.
[170:55.09]We're almost there.
[170:56.81]Hurry up and think of another funny joke.
[171:00.03]I only got so many to think of.
[171:01.43]This is supposed to be co-op.
[171:04.05]This is supposed to be co-op.
[171:06.71]There were two people here?
[171:07.55]I know.
[171:08.31]Fucking got you.
[171:15.84]Well, enjoy this game.
[171:16.72]It was $30.
[171:18.20]Hang on.
[171:18.46]I found the clearly marked climb zone.
[171:20.76]Let's get to this last spot.
[171:22.48]If we don't play the game, we're going to move on to the next one.
[171:30.78]Don't worry.
[171:31.16]We still have plenty more.
[171:32.74]There are a lot more.
[171:34.96]Nice co-op game.
[171:35.73]I know.
[171:36.99]There's plenty more.
[171:38.11]Okay.
[171:49.81]You like that flick shot?
[171:50.75]I'm about to go to scene two.
[171:52.37]Nope.
[171:54.28]I'm about to, like, switch this.
[171:59.02]Listen, just... Give me a second, okay?
[172:02.70]You have literally 30 seconds before I change the game.
[172:06.34]Hold on.
[172:06.77]Yeah, there's a way out up there.
[172:09.47]It leads to the troll.
[172:10.49]Yeah.
[172:12.29]So get up there.
[172:13.11]Leads to the troll.
[172:13.83]Who's that?
[172:14.75]Who's there?
[172:15.17]I'm going to say that this is not, I didn't mean switch this like the game, but I mean like the console, but I guess you could take it that way.
[172:20.57]Yeah.
[172:22.64]Alright.
[172:22.92]Do a climbing segment.
[172:23.68]When you get up here.
[172:24.36]Guess what button I have to push.
[172:26.08]I can do this.
[172:27.76]Actually, no button.
[172:28.78]No button is required.
[172:29.84]Interesting.
[172:36.47]You left for 10 minutes and they still don't have the troll.
[172:38.45]Well, that means you left the stream, which means it must be pretty fucking boring.
[172:44.57]God damn it.
[172:46.77]I knew this game was going to be a failure.
[172:48.43]I thought it was going to be an absolute jam.
[172:50.57]I knew it was.
[172:51.80]Alright, come on.
[172:52.32]Last cutscene before the co-op starts.
[172:55.32]Where is he?
[172:57.14]Look, the troll is going to come and save you.
[172:58.34]You're going to get overwhelmed.
[172:59.98]Did the explosion make these?
[173:01.20]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[173:01.82]Look where they come.
[173:04.23]Do I have to, like, fight all of them?
[173:05.77]Yeah, but the troll is gonna come and save you, and then I get to troll.
[173:09.77]So go up and just fight them all.
[173:10.75]Kick all their asses.
[173:11.29]Just xxxxxxx.
[173:15.67]Don't even throw- just xxxxxxx.
[173:20.67]Okay yyy. There's one. That's all you have to do.
[173:31.79]but is there a sword on the ground it doesn't matter you're gonna get a troll you're gonna get a giant sword by 25 seconds here he comes no it is the boss you get overwhelmed and then I come save you that's how every Disney movie works just watch
[173:47.33]I know.
[173:47.59]I'm overwhelmed.
[173:48.87]I don't know what to do.
[173:50.03]There's too many of them.
[173:51.37]This is like the bad Zelda.
[173:54.35]Thank you.
[173:54.93]I will take that for fucking 200 points.
[173:57.29]If I was on Jeopardy, I would win.
[173:58.71]I can't even see.
[174:00.09]I got it.
[174:00.55]It's so dark.
[174:02.69]Where are all these rocks coming from?
[174:05.40]I smashed it.
[174:06.04]The troll hit it.
[174:06.84]Why is it daytime again?
[174:09.48]It was daytime the whole time.
[174:10.28]Here we go.
[174:10.62]Hold on.
[174:11.60]We're not done.
[174:13.44]I'm clearly right in front of you.
[174:17.53]We're not friends yet.
[174:18.77]We gotta make friends first.
[174:20.25]We gotta be sure you're not gonna kill me first.
[174:22.05]I'm not.
[174:23.19]I wouldn't do that.
[174:24.34]But I'm not convinced yet because you haven't expressed your friendship by extending your arm.
[174:28.78]Sorry, he just looks like fucking Gizmo from the Gremlins.
[174:31.67]I tripped.
[174:33.22]Now you're gonna be right on my back.
[174:37.55]How dare you.
[174:41.01]We've lost like 300 viewers since coming to this stupid game.
[174:44.23]That's how dedicated we are.
[174:45.80]This is dedication.
[174:46.84]We have to see this.
[174:47.64]This is 30 fucking dollars.
[174:49.36]We don't do this for the numbers.
[174:51.48]This is not for the view count.
[174:52.54]This is for the co-op.
[174:54.36]We need to see this through.
[175:01.36]You just saved me.
[175:03.11]You saved me.
[175:04.05]Stop hitting start.
[175:04.79]It's not going to help.
[175:06.71]You saved me.
[175:09.45]It doesn't matter how many buttons you press.
[175:11.44]You might as well hand me one of those.
[175:12.94]You saved me from those monsters.
[175:14.56]I better not be the guy.
[175:15.36]I don't want to be the guy who's born.
[175:16.68]Why?
[175:25.54]That was a little effort.
[175:28.56]This way.
[175:29.00]Come with me.
[175:29.57]I expended all my effort on 1-2-Switch.
[175:33.45]That really was a lot of effort for 1-2-3-Switch.
[175:35.39]I'm, like, tired now.
[175:39.25]Is it title screen or the end credits?
[175:41.53]Troll and I. Title screen or end credits.
[175:44.51]I don't know which.
[175:49.51]Here we go.
[175:51.98]Lost another 100 people.
[175:57.07]Just give us a chance.
[175:58.11]We're going to move on.
[175:59.05]Just give us a chance.
[175:59.73]Don't leave yet.
[176:02.62]Jerma.
[176:03.30]Groveling for viewers.
[176:04.64]I know that you fucking hate this, but come on, this is $30.
[176:09.35]Give us a chance.
[176:10.47]This is an expensive joke.
[176:11.59]Give us a chance.
[176:12.15]We're dropping people like flies.
[176:13.81]Give us a fucking, give us a chance.
[176:15.37]Give us one chance.
[176:17.19]If it's not the funniest thing you've ever seen in your life, then you can go ahead and, it's not, wait, it's not, let's set the bar way too high.
[176:22.78]If it's not a mildly amusing stream.
[176:24.74]Okay, let's get this one.
[176:25.62]Okay, good, here we go.
[176:28.56]And that one.
[176:29.78]And this one.
[176:30.52]Alright, it's my turn.
[176:31.80]Where are they coming from?
[176:33.34]Where am I?
[176:34.04]It's just us.
[176:36.06]Where are you?
[176:38.04]We're both you.
[176:38.62]How are we both the troll?
[176:42.44]I can turn the camera.
[176:43.30]It's just like being the guy, except bigger.
[176:48.44]Where's the co-op?
[176:49.46]I don't know.
[176:49.88]Hit start.
[176:51.08]Is there like a Steam refund?
[176:53.14]Hit start.
[176:55.14]Why does it say leave co-op?
[176:56.54]Leave co-op.
[176:59.98]Hit it.
[177:00.90]You can't go down.
[177:02.42]You can't go down to that.
[177:04.26]Abandon ship.
[177:07.67]Sometimes you gotta abandon ship.
[177:10.03]Cut your losses.
[177:12.41]It was $30.
[177:12.85]Cut your losses.
[177:14.09]We're cutting our fucking losses here.
[177:17.39]We got to the troll.
[177:18.67]You shot the troll.
[177:19.51]They told us that we had to play 20 minutes.
[177:21.43]Saw a guy smash his face into a rock.
[177:23.73]That was a couple funny jokes.
[177:25.33]That was pretty funny.
[177:28.91]I feel bad for now
[177:32.31]should alright so now we hi I think we have to we have to bounce back I mean that's not that that's just the bounce this is not bouncing back that is bouncing back it's not yeah it is because it's got the same it's got the same stick as the other one bouncing back remember the other one when it was like when it was like 3200 viewers alright go ahead go ahead click it doing it for the numbers yeah fine click it like this is good I can't wait to bounce back on this one we're gonna bounce back
[178:00.95]No one's going to want to watch it.
[178:01.75]We're going to lose more people.
[178:07.09]I mean, the highlight of the whole night was the baby.
[178:08.93]I gotta say.
[178:09.51]I don't know.
[178:10.92]I don't know if I agree with that.
[178:11.90]Harmonix made this?
[178:15.28]They did?
[178:15.86]That's weird.
[178:16.96]This is not Rock Band.
[178:22.21]I'm not even going to read what you said out loud because I'm not going to tell you because he'll do it.
[178:25.77]Somebody said the D word.
[178:26.66]I'm not going to say it out loud.
[178:28.06]Because he'll do it.
[178:29.32]The D word?
[178:31.30]Yeah.
[178:32.54]I'm leaving this shitty stream.
[178:33.82]Don't!
[178:34.42]Just wait!
[178:35.18]Just wait until you see our Saturday morning kids cartoon game that we have.
[178:39.36]Listen, Harmonix is reputable.
[178:40.97]I told you we shouldn't have done this one, Ned.
[178:42.43]We should have waited.
[178:44.15]There was a couple other options.
[178:46.15]We shouldn't have done this.
[178:47.99]Shouldn't have done this.
[178:49.91]This guy's name is Wubwub.
[178:51.09]This is a sports game.
[178:54.97]It features standing up and calibration.
[178:57.39]Okay, but local wireless play.
[178:59.06]No, it's play, right?
[179:00.20]Yeah, it's play.
[179:01.68]One wacky ball.
[179:02.56]We've got wacky ball, net ball, double golf, and buddy ball.
[179:06.78]Okay, we're going to do wacky bat.
[179:08.94]We are going to do wacky bat.
[179:25.10]How do I join the fucking game?
[179:28.74]Oh, there we go.
[179:32.94]Should I even change the screen title or are we going to be here for five minutes?
[179:36.27]You know what I mean?
[179:37.19]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[179:37.91]Where are you?
[179:38.39]At some point.
[179:40.49]Boy, did I not.
[179:42.05]Did I open this?
[179:43.01]You did.
[179:43.41]This is mine.
[179:44.09]That's yours.
[179:47.11]I didn't hear the loud fucking noise.
[179:48.65]Alright.
[179:49.77]I'm sorry.
[179:50.05]Hang on.
[179:52.24]What are you doing?
[179:53.00]You didn't join the game.
[179:54.48]I pressed the two L and R buttons.
[180:01.78]I didn't touch anything.
[180:02.82]You pressed a bunch of buttons.
[180:06.56]Maybe do local multiplayer.
[180:07.87]That's what we're doing.
[180:09.93]He keeps mashing buttons.
[180:15.01]Just fucking play it.
[180:16.49]What?
[180:17.21]Just play it?
[180:17.97]No, just quit.
[180:21.75]No one's dabbing on this string.
[180:23.51]I fucking refuse it.
[180:28.61]He'll do it.
[180:29.75]He's not on the stream right now.
[180:31.34]Why do you think I'll do it?
[180:32.20]No, I know you'll do it.
[180:33.10]Alright, join.
[180:34.04]Push the join button.
[180:37.90]It's the button that's highlighted.
[180:39.07]He'll fucking do it.
[180:39.99]He's not, there's no way.
[180:41.25]He's not even gonna be like even, I'm not gonna even give him a chance.
[180:44.87]He's had like a few drinks, like no fucking way.
[180:46.99]None of the million is gonna let him do this.
[180:48.55]I need at least one more before I dab on stream.
[180:51.63]Okay, we got a confirmation.
[180:53.01]I need at least to finish, if I finish this one and move on to the next one, maybe.
[180:59.16]No, don't you fucking dare.
[181:01.40]I make no promises.
[181:02.42]If you dab on stream, then I'm gonna make you leave.
[181:05.18]I will be like, get out of this room.
[181:09.72]Get the best medal you can by hitting every pitch.
[181:11.87]Press.
[181:15.21]That's not fun.
[181:16.09]To build your streak, never miss.
[181:19.09]Move between lanes.
[181:20.15]Wacky bat.
[181:21.31]Wacky bat.
[181:22.19]Okay, let's just go.
[181:23.35]How are you doing that?
[181:27.93]Are you on the bottom?
[181:28.97]I'm on the bottom.
[181:29.73]I'm red.
[181:33.32]That's you.
[181:34.48]You have to be lower.
[181:36.40]I don't know how to get off of you.
[181:45.56]I want a reminder that you wanted this game.
[181:51.82]I want a reminder that you wanted this game.
[181:57.65]That's all I want.
[182:00.97]Perfect.
[182:02.03]Sometimes you strike out.
[182:04.87]Sometimes you swing and you miss, and sometimes you hit a home run.
[182:08.17]Wacky Sports is not the best game.
[182:10.37]It's a harmonics rhythm game.
[182:15.60]I'm still having fun.
[182:16.82]No, change the game.
[182:18.78]We lost.
[182:19.42]We're losing right now.
[182:37.68]We are losing.
[182:39.50]If you want to know what losing looks like, it's what is going on with these viewers on the stream.
[182:44.94]They're gone.
[182:45.48]We have a subconscious streamer in here.
[182:48.19]If I see 500 people leave a stream, then something's not going right.
[182:51.93]Those guys don't know what a good stream is.
[182:56.16]Listen.
[182:57.18]Whatever.
[182:57.86]Alright, last- Let's be real.
[182:59.28]Alright?
[182:59.58]Hang on.
[183:01.30]Let's be real.
[183:01.60]You're going too close.
[183:02.40]Those 500, we're not gonna give any money to this stream anyway.
[183:05.68]What the fuck?
[183:08.08]Wait, hey.
[183:09.40]Let's fucking correct the record here.
[183:11.14]Alright, now you get a dab.
[183:19.66]Now you get a- Did I get- Did I-
[183:29.12]Stop fucking doing this.
[183:31.38]Alright, well, you picked the game.
[183:34.74]Go to the right.
[183:36.18]To the right.
[183:37.78]Right here.
[183:39.13]The real game?
[183:39.87]No, this one.
[183:40.85]That's the real game.
[183:42.21]That's the real game.
[183:43.21]This one over here.
[183:43.87]That one.
[183:44.71]Oh, no.
[183:45.35]I have to have, like, a tablet for this.
[183:48.57]Oh, well, then we'll do this one.
[183:50.99]No, that one.
[183:51.93]That one's not going to go well.
[183:53.41]This one.
[183:54.15]This one.
[183:54.95]Are you sure?
[183:55.39]Yes.
[183:56.44]Like, okay, you know what that entails?
[183:59.04]Yes.
[183:59.74]Can I be on the stream again?
[184:00.66]Are you promising that you're not going to dab?
[184:02.96]Yeah, I need to take a pee break.
[184:04.24]You need to take a pee break?
[184:05.79]Mm-hmm.
[184:05.97]So if you're going to take a pee break, then why don't we just... I can wait until after this.
[184:09.79]Okay, that's fine.
[184:10.47]Okay, go.
[184:16.49]Okay, here we go.
[184:17.01]Tetris.
[184:18.23]Well, you know what it is.
[184:20.35]You know what it is.
[184:21.07]It's Puyo Puyo Tetris.
[184:22.25]But it's competitive.
[184:24.36]Puyo Puyo Tetris.
[184:29.15]Why are you laughing about this?
[184:30.71]Because we're playing... Oh, we've been failing?
[184:34.51]We've been losing 500 viewers?
[184:37.09]Let's play a surefire hit.
[184:38.89]Puyo Puyo Tetris.
[184:40.76]That'll bring them back.
[184:41.78]Just watch the fucking view count go over.
[184:43.66]Like 500 viewers.
[184:44.40]They'll come right back once they see we're playing Puyo Puyo Tetris.
[184:48.08]Just fucking wait till 10,000 people come back to the stream.

[191:10.20]There's no hot.
[191:11.00]It's medium or... I'm gonna be spicy.
[191:13.48]Fine, I'll be... I'll be... Fine.
[191:16.18]Spicy is one level harder than the last that we just played.
[191:21.31]And you're going to see the difference.
[191:24.73]Alright, so swap game mode is both... Together.
[191:27.45]Move us to... They can see.

[192:14.08]Okay, we're fine.
[192:17.51]Everything's gonna be fine.
[192:22.55]No, it's not, because Puyo Puyo is like too, this is too fast.
[192:28.97]Whoops.
[192:37.64]Just like Kinect 4.
[192:38.46]Oh, you just ruined everything.
[192:39.50]So badly.
[192:40.04]Squish me, please.
[192:41.74]Squish me, squish me, squish me.
[192:45.30]Thank you.
[192:45.74]Alright, this is where it gets serious.
[192:51.19]Oh!
[192:55.93]God damn it!
[193:24.26]I gotta get a chain here.
[193:25.36]Bad, so bad.

[193:31.68]No!
[193:34.37]Come on, come on.
[193:39.83]Just like fucking old grandma used to do.
[193:42.43]Got it.
[194:09.05]No!
[194:09.63]Double chain, baby.
[194:13.67]I'm dead, I'm dead.
[194:15.69]Spicy's too hot!
[194:19.57]That's right, you gotta win two in a row though.
[194:21.42]You gotta win two in a row.
[194:23.06]I get another chance.
[194:24.54]I get another chance at redemption.
[194:25.80]It's the best out of three battles here, okay?
[194:28.22]Best of three.
[194:35.66]Greens, greens.
[194:36.46]Get these fucking greens out of here.
[195:02.55]Are you kidding me?
[195:03.01]Already?
[195:03.41]Do you have what it takes?
[195:05.09]Already.
[195:05.53]That's bullshit.
[195:06.58]Already.
[195:08.46]Do you have what it takes?
[195:09.58]Apparently not.
[195:15.75]Do you have what it takes?
[195:31.83]It's fine, I can handle that easily.
[195:37.30]Deny that shit, get that out of here.
[195:43.26]I freaked out, I freaked it out.
[195:53.15]I don't, bank it.
[195:54.47]How do you pull it out of hold?
[195:55.89]Same button, but you have to do at least one.
[196:03.21]at least one other block.
[196:08.49]This is just like concentration, we're not even speaking.
[196:19.74]Just like, I'm gonna win.
[196:27.36]You just wait.
[196:31.00]I'm gonna win.
[196:31.68]You better not.
[196:34.80]Eventually.
[196:36.13]So where's your... I got a double chain.
[196:37.43]What the fuck is going on here?
[196:38.31]Coming.
[196:39.39]You gotta wait.
[196:44.13]I don't wanna wait.
[196:45.25]I want the immediate gratification.
[196:47.05]This is bad.
[196:53.76]Oh no.
[196:54.90]I messed it all up.
[196:57.45]Goodbye!
[197:01.06]Spicy's too hot.
[197:07.06]Whoops, I missed that one.
[197:08.14]It's okay.
[197:13.71]I got that one back.
[197:15.81]I can't play on Spicy under this condition, alright?
[197:18.35]Now we both play it.
[197:19.13]Now we play the same thing, but both on medium.
[197:25.80]Hey, wasn't that fun?
[197:26.98]Pull your Tetris.
[197:33.04]Move on to the next one.
[197:33.84]I got to pee.
[197:35.07]Alright, go pee.
[197:37.07]You go to the bathroom.
[197:38.31]We'll get the next one set.
[197:39.37]I'm going to read some bits.
[197:41.11]The next one is that the screen, you know, we're not muted, but you know, don't matter.
[197:47.71]Yeah, we're doing the real game.
[197:49.30]Bring another one of these for me.
[197:50.06]Are we doing the real game?
[197:51.72]No, we're not doing the real game.
[197:53.00]Are you doing the... Which game?
[197:54.57]The fucking Butterfly... Yeah, fine.
[197:56.43]Hold on.
[197:57.05]Is there a game you can do?
[198:44.09]This is not a joke.
[198:45.21]He's actually showing me how to use the controllers.
[198:47.67]So, bear with us for one moment.
[198:56.04]Okay, that's fine.
[198:56.84]Yeah, I'm ready.
[198:58.46]I'm going to regret it.
[198:59.28]That's fine.
[199:00.92]Okay, see you in a minute.
[199:02.60]Hey, see you later.
[199:03.64]Say bye to them.
[199:04.10]Be right back.
[199:24.79]The game's already here.
[199:28.01]What?
[199:30.77]The game is already here?
[199:38.27]What's going on?
[199:47.31]Didn't even tell me how to play!
[200:01.03]Alright, I guess we're going... Wow!
[200:11.97]This is a Switch game, yes it is.
[200:13.27]It was like... Okay, you know when you walk by like an arcade cabinet, and you put a coin in, and then you press the start button, that's it.
[200:24.08]How much was this game?
[200:29.08]I feel bad for, like, putting these in his library.
[200:34.28]Like, this is gonna be in Etalyx' Switch library for the rest of his life.
[200:40.13]We're only doing this till he gets back, because he went to go get, like, a drink.
[200:42.59]Are you back?
[200:52.07]Hello?
[200:54.41]There's nobody in that door.
[200:58.95]Okay, that's enough of this one.
[201:00.97]Personal ranking got D.
[201:03.68]47,000.
[201:12.10]I got a fucking itchy nose after this one.
[201:15.00]Well, alright.
[201:15.79]There's that one.
[201:18.59]That one was really bad.
[201:19.73]That one was fucking terrible.
[201:23.35]What did I just do?
[201:25.95]We got at least a handful of real games left that are fucking gonna be fun.
[201:29.86]Okay?
[201:30.86]Like, for real.
[201:33.88]Fun games.
[201:36.26]And guess what?

[201:48.07]You want me to do it?
[201:50.55]Fine.
[201:51.71]You're gonna get a fucking dab on stream.
[201:52.83]Here it comes.
[201:57.11]Kidding me.
[201:58.09]Not gonna fucking happen.
[202:00.33]It's fucking serious.
[202:02.85]Not in a fucking thousand years.
[202:06.06]Let me read some bits before he gets back.
[202:07.30]And then we're gonna play the actual video game of the... No, no, no, no.

[203:25.53]He knows he's a good boy.
[203:26.89]He's not going to do it.

[203:40.22]That's not what happened.
[203:43.46]I did not dab and I did not salute anybody.
[203:47.71]I went like this.
[203:50.11]Like that.
[203:53.13]Don't you talk shit.
[203:54.63]Get that shit out of here.
[203:56.95]But thank you for the $5.
[203:59.20]Uh, Vodkar, thanks for the one dollar.
[204:00.94]Happy birthday.
[204:01.52]It's not my birthday.
[204:07.02]We all know he just opened the door.
[204:07.98]What?
[204:10.09]You done yet?
[204:10.57]Kind of.
[204:13.37]That's not a dab!
[204:14.49]That was like a fucking power move from Power Rangers.
[204:17.91]Did you dab?
[204:18.85]I went like this.
[204:20.91]That's like a fucking power move from like 1995 Power Rangers, right?
[204:25.07]That's not a fucking dab.
[204:26.75]Dabbing is stupid.
[204:28.39]Dabbing is dumb.
[204:29.23]You're talking about when they like, when they land, like after they do a flip, they land, they go like that?
[204:34.86]Exactly.
[204:36.26]See?
[204:37.16]You guys don't even fucking know Power Rangers 1996.
[204:39.58]Some of you might.
[204:40.54]Well, there's like 700 doctors here.
[204:43.64]Alright, we're going to play a game that people may have been waiting for.
[204:50.35]And you know which one to do.
[204:52.11]The real one.
[204:53.31]Oh, we're playing a video game.
[204:54.27]We're playing a real video game now.
[204:55.81]Give me a little bit more space.
[204:59.51]My nose, did you do something in here?
[205:01.98]Like, did you like spray something in here?
[205:03.58]In your nose?
[205:04.42]No, did you spray something in the air?
[205:06.18]No.
[205:07.10]I have like an itchy fucking nose.
[205:08.34]Alright, do what you gotta do.
[205:09.64]You were saying I had something in my nose.
[205:11.08]Shut the fuck up about this shitty meme.
[205:14.45]What meme?
[205:15.39]I'm trying to stop it.
[205:16.33]Are you doing a meme?
[205:17.53]No, I'm trying to stop the fucking dab meme.
[205:19.49]I'm trying to stop it.
[205:22.81]Got an ingrown hair on my nose, too.
[205:24.47]I'm sure you probably fucking already noticed.
[205:26.05]Thanks a lot, guys.
[205:26.67]Thanks for making me feel self-conscious.
[205:29.14]Are we doing the real video game?
[205:30.30]Yes.
[205:31.40]We're doing the real video game.
[205:34.08]This one I'm actually personally excited about.
[205:36.12]Because I've been wanting to play it for real.
[205:40.19]for a long time.
[205:41.25]He's been, he wants me, he's been wanting me to play this game for a long time.
[205:43.41]For real.
[205:44.13]For real.
[205:44.79]Because I... Angry elf.
[205:47.03]Angry elf.
[205:50.11]And if any game makes you angry... What did he call me?
[205:52.81]What did he say?
[205:53.79]What was it?
[205:54.15]What did he say?
[205:54.97]Yeah, I was an angry what?

[206:16.34]No, it's Overcooked.
[206:18.06]We're going to actually play Overcooked.
[206:21.18]Where's a good place for the camera?
[206:26.70]No, what are you... Get the fuck out of here.
[206:29.15]What are you doing?
[206:30.75]Right there.
[206:32.05]I had it in the perfect spot.
[206:33.83]I'm talking about on the OBS.
[206:35.63]I had it in a good spot.
[206:40.87]It was actually in a great spot until you moved it.
[206:46.90]Why is every game loud?
[206:47.86]Because no developer understands.
[206:49.72]Too much.
[206:51.22]Right there.
[206:52.32]What do you mean too much?
[206:55.54]That's fine.
[206:55.94]You don't want to be more than 50% of the fucking volume of the whole screen.
[207:00.88]Overcut.
[207:03.17]Let's play Overcut.
[207:03.79]I've never played this game before.
[207:04.73]He has.
[207:05.11]He's going to teach me how to play it.
[207:06.53]Where is the least information on the screen?
[207:09.03]Where should the webcam be?
[207:09.81]That's what I'm trying to ask you.
[207:11.59]Uh...
[207:14.14]We'll find out.
[207:16.32]We're going to start a new game.
[207:18.72]This game is about having fun with your friends and messing up and fucking up.
[207:22.78]Why is this not correct here?
[207:26.41]It's like the aspect ratio is not... Well, delete your current campaign progress.
[207:29.89]I want you to know that for you, I am deleting everything that I've done up until now in this game, so I need your solemn promise that this is going to be more than a five-minute experience.
[207:43.63]Sure.
[207:46.72]You heard it?
[207:47.76]I heard it?
[207:49.48]More than five.
[207:49.98]Of course it would be more than five minutes.
[207:58.11]Over.
[208:00.09]Unlike some other games that might feature troll-like creatures, this game has co-op from the beginning of the game.
[208:07.41]Where are you going?
[208:08.38]What are you doing?
[208:10.92]What the fuck are you doing?
[208:12.92]It's good.
[208:13.28]Let's go.
[208:13.60]Let's go.
[208:16.97]So what's the premise of this game?
[208:19.15]You cook food.
[208:20.47]You cook food.
[208:21.05]You got it.
[208:21.35]Okay, I'm joining.
[208:22.09]You cook food in a team.
[208:23.77]Okay.
[208:25.49]And it takes exquisite and above average, I would say, competence in the kitchen.
[208:33.67]Right.
[208:35.27]Needs a little bit of coordination, a little bit of teamwork.
[208:38.08]Okay.
[208:38.22]A little bit of multitasking.
[208:40.62]Sure.
[208:42.54]This will not switch off of Puyo Puyo Tetris.
[208:46.58]Please switch off of Puyo Puyo Tetris.
[208:49.74]Overcooked.
[208:50.86]No, not Overwatch.
[208:52.18]We're not playing Overwatch.
[208:54.18]Overcooked.
[208:58.90]It won't do it.
[208:59.64]So, whatever.
[209:02.66]Let's go.
[209:05.16]Who do you want to be?
[209:07.94]Are you going to be the cat guy?
[209:08.96]I'm going to be the reindeer.
[209:11.46]You should be the raccoon.
[209:14.98]No, I want to be the reindeer.
[209:15.80]No, you'll be the raccoon.
[209:17.28]I'm not going to be that.
[209:17.84]I'm going to be... He has, like, bonus abilities.
[209:19.95]The reindeer.
[209:20.89]He has, like, better abilities.
[209:22.07]I don't care.
[209:22.39]I'm going to be the reindeer.
[209:25.03]It's Christmas.
[209:25.55]This is a fucking... Hey, by the way, get a handshake.
[209:28.40]Happy holidays.
[209:29.02]Merry Christmas.
[209:35.88]What are these Muppet moves?
[209:36.90]I don't know what these moves.
[209:37.88]I'm just gonna tell you.
[209:38.62]We're gonna do the tutorial first.
[209:39.96]Alright, good.
[209:40.74]So how do you turn the link?
[209:42.12]It's like a 30 second tutorial.
[209:43.32]Alright, we're gonna play this one for like at least 12 minutes.
[209:47.06]This is like... This is... We're gonna play it longer than 12 minutes.
[209:51.27]Maybe.
[209:53.65]We're gonna play this game far longer than 12 minutes.
[209:56.23]Because... Uh, hey, Jacket, if you're here.
[209:58.09]There's not really many other games after this.
[210:02.01]Jacket, if you're here, or Sam, try to change the name of the game to Overcooked.
[210:05.60]Excuse me.
[210:08.66]Oh, that's Burger King.
[210:10.64]No, what's his name?
[210:11.44]Mayor McCheese.
[210:12.02]No, he's an onion.
[210:12.86]That's Mayor McCheese.
[210:13.74]He's an onion.
[210:14.80]Remember, he had a jail at the McDonald's.
[210:16.46]The world is ending.
[210:17.48]There's a giant meatball creature that's destroying the world as we know it.
[210:23.00]And the only way to stop the apocalypse is to feed him enough food that he goes away.
[210:32.39]The game might be low.
[210:34.23]It's not.
[210:34.45]Alright.
[210:35.05]Here you go.
[210:35.97]We have a minute and 40 seconds.
[210:36.87]Pick up and green it.
[210:37.33]How do you pick stuff up?
[210:38.50]Alright.
[210:38.88]So you're going to use this button to pick up and drop.
[210:41.82]Okay.
[210:42.54]And then the top button to interact.
[210:46.18]So you got tomatoes?
[210:46.94]Alright, so we're trying to make, at the top left corner, we're trying to make a salad.
[210:51.66]Okay, so I got a plate for you.
[210:52.94]Alright, so put that on the plate.
[210:54.92]I chopped up the lettuce.
[210:56.16]Yep.
[210:57.10]Now take that over to the meatball.
[210:59.10]Feed him.
[210:59.75]He gets $6 for a tip.
[211:01.17]Alright, now I'm going to make another salad.
[211:02.89]Salad.
[211:05.27]Plate.
[211:09.09]It's the end of the world.
[211:09.93]There's a minute and 30 seconds to eat.
[211:11.89]No, that's just lettuce.
[211:12.93]Nobody wants a lettuce salad.
[211:14.77]Thank you.
[211:16.01]Hurry up.
[211:16.31]I need ingredients.
[211:16.99]Okay, we got... I'm gonna give you more than one.
[211:20.17]Two tomatoes.
[211:20.59]I only need a lettuce for this salad.
[211:23.05]Two lettuces.
[211:25.58]Plate.
[211:27.50]This is an end of the world scenario.
[211:29.44]Put it down.
[211:29.92]I'm trying.
[211:30.58]Take it.
[211:30.96]Tomato.
[211:31.52]Turn it in.
[211:32.28]Just lettuce.
[211:32.68]Okay, got it.
[211:33.06]Another plate.
[211:36.36]This is lettuce and tomato.
[211:40.20]Got it.
[211:40.82]Got it.
[211:41.32]Good.
[211:43.52]56 seconds left till the end of the world.
[211:44.72]This is just lettuce, right?
[211:45.70]Just lettuce.
[211:46.48]I have no lettuce whatsoever.
[211:47.66]No, I'm just going to feed him raw tomatoes.
[211:48.92]Hold on, wait.
[211:51.16]You're going to make the meatball very unhappy.
[211:54.69]Lettuce and tomato?
[211:55.25]Alright, well, you get the lettuce.
[211:57.89]I don't have any lettuce.
[211:58.77]I'll get you in a second.
[212:00.85]This is contingent on you being an amazing supplier of food.
[212:07.37]Lettuce, tomato.
[212:08.05]Who's who?
[212:08.51]I'm on the left.
[212:09.39]I'm on the right.
[212:11.10]I am the raccoon.
[212:12.84]I'm the reindeer.
[212:14.63]That doesn't look like a reindeer from here.
[212:16.01]It's a reindeer.
[212:16.47]Alright, let us tomato.
[212:17.37]If you say so.
[212:18.43]Again, let us tomato.
[212:22.91]Okay, I got you.
[212:23.51]You gotta chop these up.
[212:24.75]We've only got 172 points.
[212:26.13]That's like nothing.
[212:27.65]How many does it take to win?
[212:31.75]You hear the music getting faster?
[212:33.51]Take the plate.
[212:34.81]Take the plate!
[212:35.45]Five seconds.
[212:37.19]And one tomato.
[212:39.41]It's no good.
[212:40.61]You lost.
[212:41.75]Wasn't enough points.
[212:42.61]You lost the tutorial.
[212:44.01]Can we actually lose the tutorial?
[212:45.17]How can you lose the tutorial?
[212:47.05]We expect you to be a little bit better at gaming than that.
[212:50.03]We did a lot of food.
[212:51.75]Before we played this, I was told that you beat certain games on stream that people might consider difficult.
[212:56.21]And now I'm not sure.
[213:02.04]Time for a head of lettuce in between two buns.
[213:03.78]Yeah.
[213:04.72]He's gonna get it.
[213:08.14]Okay, so where do we go?
[213:09.58]How do we play the actual game?
[213:11.60]Maybe McCheese has a dog that watches TV.
[213:13.32]Cool.
[213:15.81]Intro Onion House.
[213:18.15]Okay, so this is the actual game.
[213:20.33]Okay.
[213:21.59]I'm ready.
[213:22.99]Stop skipping lore.
[213:25.73]L and R?
[213:26.51]You want the lore of this game, you need to go to the digital database online.
[213:29.68]Top 10 stream fails.
[213:30.92]What?
[213:31.58]We just did it.
[213:32.12]What are you talking about?
[213:35.71]I think Bungie has a repository of all the lore for this game.
[213:39.88]Online.
[213:41.76]Etalyx didn't dab, so I'm leaving.
[213:45.84]Why'd you read that out loud?
[213:48.55]Why are you cutting me off the stream?
[213:50.05]You don't do it.
[213:51.53]Look, I'll only do it.
[213:53.23]I'll only do it for enough money.
[213:55.73]Stop with the money joke.
[213:57.83]How do I play this game?
[213:59.85]Fucking money.
[214:01.41]How do you make a soup?
[214:02.89]How many people are there?
[214:04.53]I don't know.
[214:05.13]How many people are there?
[214:07.98]There's 24, 23.
[214:08.46]Alright, if it gets back up to 3,000 before the end of the stream.
[214:11.72]It's like 1 o'clock in the morning.
[214:13.26]That's not going to happen.
[214:14.92]If it gets back up to 3,000 before the end of the stream.
[214:18.10]I'll dab on shrimp.
[214:18.94]Oh, my fucking God.
[214:20.30]I hope we drop shrimp viewers.
[214:22.58]Alright, let's go.
[214:24.13]How do you make a soup?
[214:26.05]How do you make a soup?
[214:27.86]How to make basic soup.
[214:28.94]Look, you take the onions, three of them.
[214:30.50]Chop it up, put it in the broth.
[214:31.40]Chop them up, put them in the broth.
[214:32.90]And there's the soup.
[214:33.46]Put them in the cup.
[214:34.20]Okay, I'm ready.
[214:35.63]Are you?
[214:36.55]Uh, no.
[214:36.95]You go to the other side.
[214:37.65]Okay.
[214:38.49]Onion.
[214:39.75]That's a fire extinguisher.
[214:40.73]Okay, what do I do with this?
[214:43.05]Oops.
[214:43.29]Okay, onion.
[214:44.17]Put that back.
[214:45.27]What's this?
[214:45.89]Plate?
[214:46.23]That's an onion.
[214:46.77]Onion.
[214:47.53]Yeah.
[214:47.93]Where's the knife?
[214:48.41]You go to the other side.
[214:49.31]Okay.
[214:50.45]Pick up the onion.
[214:51.01]Alright, pick up the knife.
[214:53.01]Onion.
[214:54.81]Knife?
[214:55.45]You have more than I have to drink.
[214:56.77]Okay, got it.
[214:57.55]And then what do you press?
[214:58.32]Put the button to, like, chop it.
[214:59.74]Okay, got it.
[215:00.42]And then put it back on the middle.
[215:02.06]Or you can take it all the way in.
[215:03.20]Alright, I will chop the onions.
[215:04.74]Yeah, you chop the onions.
[215:07.50]Actually, you do the other thing.
[215:08.40]I'll chop the onions.
[215:09.16]What?
[215:10.32]You go do this.
[215:10.94]How many do you have in here?
[215:11.72]What do you do?
[215:12.08]I got three.
[215:12.42]It's ready.
[215:12.74]You just gotta let it cook.
[215:14.78]See the progress bar?
[215:16.04]You a gamer?
[215:16.48]Do I have to press X?
[215:17.78]Just let it cook.
[215:18.72]So what am I supposed to do now?
[215:19.60]Give me some onions.
[215:20.99]I don't have any jobs.
[215:22.02]Stop swearing.
[215:22.68]We're in the kitchen here.
[215:23.54]This is a work environment, and I expect professionalism.
[215:28.07]Soup's ready, right?
[215:31.37]There's one.
[215:33.17]Alright, what are you doing?
[215:33.95]What are you just standing there for?
[215:35.96]Oh, that's it?
[215:36.92]That's what it takes to make one full soup?
[215:38.66]We're making onion soup.
[215:39.82]Three onions.
[215:40.44]Give me another onion.
[215:41.74]Dirty plate's got to be washed up in the sink.
[215:43.42]Alright, who's going to do that?
[215:44.60]Are you going to do that?
[215:45.18]I'll get it.
[215:45.46]I'll get it.
[215:45.86]Give me it.
[215:46.08]Alright, I'm going to put them in the sink.
[215:47.64]We need another onion, though.
[215:49.16]Okay, what onions?
[215:50.34]You've only got two onions in the onion soup.
[215:52.62]Get it together, sous chef.
[215:53.88]I'm going to just load this place with onions.
[215:55.66]Alright, well, you can do that.
[215:59.39]That food doesn't go, like, rotten, right?
[216:01.87]Give me the plate.
[216:03.67]Plate.
[216:05.65]Come get it.
[216:06.07]It's not done.
[216:10.25]It's not done.
[216:11.15]It's not done.
[216:12.19]It will be done in five... I'm about to learn more charisma in The Sims.
[216:16.12]Alright, got it.
[216:16.54]Alright, I got three more onions.
[216:19.44]Put it in the plate.
[216:20.54]The plate's right there.
[216:22.04]Wait, hold on.
[216:22.82]Look, it highlights the table you're looking at.
[216:24.56]I know, but I... My aunt plays this game smoother than you.
[216:28.66]Yeah, your aunt is...
[216:30.69]Don't say anything bad about my ants!
[216:32.34]I was about to say something bad about you.
[216:33.70]I was about to say something real bad about your rant.
[216:35.50]Alright, go on.
[216:37.16]Come on.
[216:38.04]Wash the hands.
[216:39.44]Dishes.
[216:40.10]Look, I'm doing the dishes.
[216:41.88]You take care of your business.
[216:42.94]I'll take care of mine.
[216:43.69]Got it.
[216:45.75]Take it.
[216:46.95]Why are these not fucking chopped?
[216:48.59]I gotta cut those, okay?
[216:49.85]Why are they not chopped?
[216:50.87]Alright, fine.
[216:52.09]I'll get one.
[216:52.77]Get the one to the left.
[216:53.99]You can boost with, like, the bottom button.
[216:57.03]Thanks for telling me.
[216:57.61]Appreciate it.
[216:58.71]No, don't put the plate in there.
[216:59.71]I know.
[217:00.75]This is a loaf of bread.
[217:01.97]This isn't onions.
[217:02.91]Those are a bunch of onions.
[217:04.77]Put it in there.
[217:05.59]Stop boosting around.
[217:07.03]Is there a problem to boost?
[217:08.55]Give me some more onions.
[217:09.76]Oh, God.
[217:11.48]This is the easiest level in the game.
[217:12.84]That's fine.
[217:13.54]I'll get it right.
[217:13.94]You haven't seen nothing yet.
[217:18.48]There you go.
[217:19.88]Eggs over easy.
[217:20.58]Fucking nose is so itchy.
[217:23.54]Give me the plate.
[217:24.36]Give me this.
[217:26.57]Eggs over easy.
[217:27.91]Does it have to be?
[217:28.73]I need a third one.
[217:30.21]Three?
[217:30.61]Here you go.
[217:35.57]So what if you just do two?
[217:37.39]Then you're not going to have a full onion soup.
[217:39.37]You're going to be shorting the customers, and they are going to complain.
[217:42.64]Look at this gamer over here.
[217:44.40]Double timing.
[217:45.56]They already have three.
[217:47.04]Get that third one ready.
[217:49.78]I'll get this.
[217:50.10]Switch, switch, switch.
[217:52.64]There's only 15 seconds left.
[217:53.54]Wait, wait, wait.
[217:53.90]Where'd it go?
[217:56.36]Dirty plate.
[218:00.40]Someone's gotta clean that.
[218:02.14]Oh, you have to actually clean it.
[218:03.16]I didn't know that.
[218:05.22]It's not here.
[218:06.68]Soup!
[218:12.43]Three stars.
[218:13.25]We did fine.
[218:13.89]Three stars.
[218:14.19]We did fine.

[222:37.18]How about this?
[222:38.24]You do the tomato shit, I'll do the onion shit.

[223:08.66]Gordon Ramsay's ultimate kitchen.
[223:10.86]Two stars.
[223:11.26]You got two stars.

[223:55.10]Did you say ass crinkle?
[223:58.03]Just go to the next level, please.
[224:00.17]Wait, you don't want to three star that one?

[229:04.56]He started it with like the, we're playing like a fun like Troll and I and we lost like 300 viewers.
[229:12.93]Wow, 10% of the viewers are gone.
[229:15.77]Better switch games quick before the rest of them leave.
[229:18.83]Hey, I lost $200 with this shit.
[229:21.71]That's a lot of money.
[229:23.97]I paid 200- I bought all these- I bought $200 worth of these fucking games.
[229:29.18]Not this one.
[229:30.30]Not this one!
[229:31.26]This is yours!
[229:31.80]Not this, this one's mine.
[229:33.08]I bought the Switch.
[229:33.84]You know how much that was to bring to the stream?
[229:35.52]$300.
[229:36.66]That is- this is his Switch.
[229:40.09]Yeah, this is my Switch, so don't act like I didn't invest in this stream.
[229:42.65]But don't feel like I didn't- don't feel like I- you know what I mean?
[229:44.99]I don't feel bad about the fucking money I dropped on this shitty stream.
[229:53.44]We're gonna play the rest of the games on 1-2-Switch.
[229:55.08]Bring that viewer count up.
[229:56.39]Dab.
[229:56.73]Just dab.
[229:57.05]Do it now.
[229:57.65]This is your only chance.
[229:58.63]This is my only chance?
[229:59.71]Literally, you only... Do it now.
[230:01.27]Do it now.
[230:01.55]Go.
[230:02.39]What am I dabbing for?
[230:03.53]You're dabbing for... To get the viewers?
[230:04.95]It's the only way to fix the stream.
[230:06.23]Do it.
[230:06.53]Go.
[230:06.59]To get the viewers?
[230:07.29]In 3... 2... 1... Ready?

[230:35.62]Alright, in three.
[230:39.69]How much money does that get?
[230:40.89]He's not going to get it.
[230:41.55]You didn't get it.
[230:42.01]It didn't get on stream.
[230:42.95]I did.
[230:43.71]No, you didn't.
[230:44.43]I did.
[230:44.65]It did not get on stream.
[230:45.39]I did get on stream.

[230:47.01]It did not get on stream.
[230:47.99]I got on stream.
[230:48.71]Tell me it did.
[230:50.35]Tell me, Chad.
[230:50.85]Nobody saw that.
[230:51.39]Did it get on stream?
[230:54.63]It's not going to fucking happen.
[230:55.67]Did it happen?
[230:56.71]I'm like scared you're going to actually like really get it done though.
[230:59.41]I think I did.
[231:00.75]No, you didn't.
[231:01.19]Yeah, I did.
[231:01.81]No, I was, I made sure of it.
[231:03.59]No, you didn't see.
[231:11.76]It's going to stay like this for like 10 minutes.
[231:15.22]They didn't see it.
[231:16.70]No, they didn't.
[231:17.52]Oh God.
[231:18.08]I'm so glad they didn't fucking see it.
[231:21.53]Okay, the joke is over.
[231:24.27]It's time to move on.
[231:25.77]Don't do it.
[231:27.61]We're going to play Overcooked.
[231:29.73]The stream eyeballed and he had fucking... You fucking piece of shit.
[231:55.11]I ain't fucking doing that.
[231:56.17]So, like, I don't care.
[232:04.24]Well, I'm unfollowing.
[232:07.58]No, I didn't.
[232:08.14]Don't.
[232:08.45]Wait.
[232:08.73]Hold on.
[232:09.17]Excuse me.
[232:09.93]Don't unfollow me.
[232:12.68]I didn't do that.
[232:14.02]He did that.
[232:14.84]I was trying desperately to make it so he wouldn't do it.
[232:17.05]It's okay, though.
[232:17.63]We're going to get the viewers back.
[232:18.79]I was trying to correct it.
[232:19.89]We're getting the viewers back.
[232:20.87]I'm sorry that that happened.
[232:22.11]I'm sorry.
[232:22.57]It annoys you.
[232:23.99]I'm sorry.
[232:24.77]That's what it took to get the viewers back.
[232:26.27]I tried to stop it.
[232:28.15]Whatever it takes.
[232:29.09]I'm sorry.
[232:34.14]Okay, let's go.
[232:36.84]It happened on my stream.
[232:38.94]But, like, okay, look.
[232:41.17]Okay, if you want to use bullshit, you want to use that excuse?
[232:45.15]Horseshit.
[232:45.84]Okay, so if you watch like, okay, let's say you're watching CNN, right?
[232:50.82]Or like NBC, Fox News, don't care what you watch.
[232:54.54]They cut to an anchor, right?
[232:56.72]I'm the anchor?
[232:57.80]You be the fucking anchor, okay?
[232:58.78]I'm the anchor?
[232:59.26]You're the anchor.
[233:00.62]So they cut to the fucking anchor.
[233:02.36]That's the anchor on the fucking camera.
[233:04.22]Oh, we got breaking news.
[233:05.47]Donald Trump pissed his pants.
[233:07.03]Okay, like that person's going to report on that.
[233:10.59]NBC cannot be responsible for the fucking naked guy that runs behind the camera.
[233:17.39]What are you supposed to do?
[233:18.63]You fucking censor it.
[233:20.37]You better be on that.
[233:21.11]No, you pull it back to the anchors.
[233:23.34]No, you pull it back to the fucking anchors and you're like, oh, sorry about that.
[233:27.48]They can't be held responsible.
[233:28.54]Some fucking naked guy ran behind the anchor.
[233:30.32]What are you going to do?
[233:32.16]You gotta have the crew ready.
[233:33.10]You can't fucking protect it.
[233:34.74]Oh, fine.
[233:35.48]Okay, fine.
[233:36.63]You go ahead and do it.
[233:37.53]Go ahead and do it.
[233:38.21]Go ahead and do a fucking anchor spot right now.
[233:40.23]Let's see how well you can deal with this.
[233:42.09]Go ahead and do it.
[233:43.29]Anchor spot.
[233:45.29]Back to you, Tom.
[233:54.36]Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the 1am news where we're reporting on a local streamer who has gone insane and left his own stream.
[234:02.58]You're not going to fucking change that.
[234:04.04]It's not going to happen.
[234:07.33]Local streamer has gone angry on his own stream and has given up the position of the lead anchor spot to his co-host, Etalyx.
[234:13.86]Etalyx bringing you such fun games as the Nintendo Switch, which is not a game, it is a console, but on that Switch, it's overcooked.
[234:20.24]You didn't prevent me from being naked on stream.
[234:22.64]You weren't naked.
[234:23.46]But, like, you didn't prevent, like, what are you supposed to do?
[234:26.29]I can't prevent you from doing that.
[234:27.45]Were you naked?
[234:27.77]It's a live cast.
[234:28.65]Was there a nipple?
[234:29.71]I was just clearly fucking naked.
[234:31.59]Was there a nipple?
[234:32.31]I was just naked.
[234:33.97]You put your clothes back on already?
[234:35.19]Yes, very quickly.
[234:36.29]It was quick.
[234:38.39]Move out of the way.
[234:39.51]No, this is my spot now.
[234:41.37]I didn't back to you.
[234:43.55]You backed to me.
[234:44.67]You don't get to just come back on.
[234:46.24]We're playing Overcooked.
[234:47.08]Get out of the fucking way.
[234:48.02]Get out of that goddamn way before I have a fucking meltdown.
[234:50.26]I'm sitting right here.
[234:51.94]Oh, you can control what somebody does on a live camera.
[234:54.54]No, you can't.
[234:56.24]Go look up, like, broadcaster gets fucking, like, fucked with on camera.
[235:01.72]I don't think that's a quote that people can search.
[235:06.44]Do you want to make a basic cheeseburger?
[235:08.22]Or do you want to talk about dabbing some more?
[235:13.12]Because you know what?
[235:13.76]I was one and done.
[235:14.50]I did it.
[235:14.88]I got it over with.
[235:15.57]Move out of the way.
[235:16.23]This is my spot now.
[235:17.39]This is not the spot.
[235:20.43]I will pick up this fucking chair and move it.
[235:22.49]I dare you.
[235:23.05]I'll get naked on this fucking stream and move this chair.
[235:28.53]So I know you guys can't tell, but he's like over there.
[235:31.53]I can't even see the screen.
[235:32.77]That's how I felt the entire stream.
[235:35.91]I have not lost my mind.
[235:37.33]I actually have a direct line of sight on the screen so I can actually play efficiently.
[235:40.71]I'm trying to prove that you cannot be held responsible for a random patron that decides to take his pants off on fucking camera while you're doing a piece on the news.
[235:52.40]If I did, you'd all be blinded.
[235:57.32]Will you please just move over so I can play the game?
[236:01.37]Why are people saying I'm insane?
[236:02.73]He's the insane one.
[236:05.53]No, I just did what the people wanted.
[236:06.93]Move out of the fucking way.
[236:09.87]Hey, look, I'm not the one.
[236:10.85]Do you want to play Overcooked?
[236:12.35]I am not the one.
[236:13.37]I didn't invite him to my house.
[236:14.57]He just walked in.
[236:15.35]I'm not the one who gave you the camping chair to play video games in for four hours on three separate streams.
[236:22.82]You know how comfortable that chair is?
[236:25.32]Since it's low to the ground, I have to look up to see the screen.
[236:28.68]That's a Stetson, okay?
[236:30.38]That's a Stetson.
[236:32.25]Stetson's arm doesn't even stay on here.
[236:34.29]That's a Stetson.
[236:35.19]You ever sit in a Stetson before?
[236:36.29]They're the most comfortable fucking chairs you've ever sat in.
[236:38.05]Well, I just sat in this chair for like 12 hours total over the last weekend.
[236:41.62]Yeah, go ahead, sit in another, sit in a cheap knockoff camping chair and then sit in a Stetson and you tell me how you feel.
[236:50.06]Unbelievable.
[236:55.13]It's probably overcooked.
[236:58.03]Tiny chair so Jerma's tall.
[237:00.21]We already did this.
[237:00.91]I already stood back to back with you.

[238:30.83]There's four skillets.
[238:31.85]Only one patty, okay.
[238:32.55]And then burgers.
[238:33.53]There's four skillets.
[238:34.27]And then a bun, and then a bun, and then a bun.
[238:35.48]Watch out.
[238:36.74]How do I flip?
[238:37.16]Do I flip it?
[238:38.30]No, you don't flip it.
[238:39.26]Did you even read the instructions?
[238:40.56]I don't fucking know.
[238:42.52]All I know is I'm supposed to be Ernie.
[238:43.76]Alright, so we got the bottom of the plate.
[238:46.14]We need lettuce, tomato, and grilled onions.
[238:48.87]No, we don't.
[238:49.69]I just said that because I'm kind of hungry.
[238:51.01]Grilled onions?
[238:52.09]No, no, we don't need... Just patty.
[238:53.19]Okay, patty.
[238:53.69]That's not even in this video game.
[238:55.21]Okay, we got a burger here.
[238:56.95]I'll be the cook.
[238:57.57]You get them out here, okay?
[238:58.77]Oh, you're the cook.
[238:59.41]Okay.
[238:59.88]I'll be the chef.
[239:00.46]Put the burgers on the grill.
[239:03.36]Yeah, I need two here.
[239:04.04]I'm going to the patty.
[239:06.91]Okay, now we need lettuce, tomato.
[239:09.29]Couple of buns here.
[239:09.85]Okay, this next one's lettuce only.
[239:15.77]Lettuce, tomato, lettuce, tomato.
[239:17.05]You're giving me way too many of these.
[239:18.15]You can come over here and help.
[239:20.15]I am in the process of cooking.
[239:22.89]You're not doing it.
[239:23.43]You're just standing there watching them cook.
[239:25.63]Oh, yeah?
[239:26.21]Am I?
[239:26.47]Because look at this.
[239:27.19]I need lettuce.
[239:30.37]I got tomato on that patty.
[239:32.81]On the bottom one, it's ready to go.
[239:34.07]Bottom one's ready to go.
[239:34.76]Top one, I need lettuce, tomato.
[239:36.26]Look, I can't do everything here.
[239:37.42]You're just standing there watching burgers cook.
[239:39.70]That's why there's a system.
[239:42.26]Fine, I'll wash the fucking dishes.
[239:45.65]Oh, no I won't.
[239:46.61]You just pushed me out of the way while I'm trying to put some tomato on here.
[239:49.61]Alright, go take like a bun and put it on all the things.
[239:53.53]Okay, I need some buns.
[239:54.45]Buns, get buns.
[239:55.03]Yeah, you put some...
[240:02.90]I got one patty here.
[240:04.24]Put some buns on those things.
[240:06.24]Put some buns on them.
[240:07.54]Get out of my way.
[240:08.16]Where are the buns?
[240:09.20]Stop hitting me.
[240:10.34]You have to take care of the buns.
[240:11.34]You're on that side.
[240:12.66]All the plates are stacked up here.
[240:16.61]You just pushed me out of the way again.
[240:18.11]This is not an efficient kitchen.
[240:20.79]Learn your place, sous chef.
[240:23.15]Give me one bun.
[240:23.69]One bun.
[240:24.03]You can put the patty on there without the bun.
[240:28.91]Didn't you know?
[240:29.45]That's it.
[240:30.94]That's it.
[240:31.68]Just let us.
[240:32.40]Are you going to stand there and re-chat, or are you going to play the game?
[240:35.38]Go get some patties.
[240:36.00]Interaction is important with a fucking stream.
[240:37.54]Go get some patties.
[240:38.26]Cut them up.
[240:38.62]There's two cutting boards here.
[240:39.72]I can't use both of them at the same time.
[240:41.12]Interaction is important with a live stream.
[240:42.53]Sorry, man.
[240:43.31]I've got to interact with my audience.
[240:45.33]Interaction ain't keeping the viewers here.
[240:47.85]Well, that's because it's fucking 1 o'clock in the morning, and it's a late night crowd.
[240:50.83]Look at the late night crowd here.
[240:52.61]Keep telling yourself that, because you don't dab on stream.
[240:55.69]Yeah, good thing you did.
[240:56.61]And now you're gonna like it tomorrow morning.
[240:57.89]You're gonna be like, wow, I dabbed on stream.
[240:59.35]What a mistake.
[241:00.03]Alright, I got... We need tomato?
[241:05.56]What do you need?
[241:06.24]I need one tomato.
[241:06.88]There's a patty ready to go right there.
[241:09.70]Turn to the head.
[241:10.48]I got this one here.
[241:11.14]Don't act like you're a professional.
[241:13.54]This is the first time you've ever played this level.
[241:16.39]Bun?
[241:17.17]Need lettuce here, please?
[241:19.45]We have a lettuce.
[241:20.59]You know what?
[241:21.03]The lettuce is there for anyone to grab.
[241:23.01]Anybody could get it.
[241:23.81]But you are the cutter, I'm the cooker.
[241:25.75]Oh, I'm the cutter so you can just stand there and watch.
[241:27.75]Watch this.
[241:29.68]You want to do something?
[241:30.78]Yeah, I'm going to cut the tomato because you won't even do it.
[241:34.64]Well, you know what goes on a cheeseburger?
[241:37.86]Meat.
[241:38.14]It has to be cooked.
[241:40.36]So step one, cook the meat.
[241:41.90]I lost viewers at night.
[241:43.80]We're just talking comedy here, guys.
[241:45.84]It's not a big deal.
[241:48.81]Why would this go on here?
[241:49.75]Oh, maybe you need a skillet to cook the burger in, professional overcooked player.
[241:53.35]Yeah, so somebody ate tilapia here.
[241:55.76]I made some fucking nice seared tilapia with flour and some salt and pepper.
[241:59.60]It was fucking delicious.
[242:00.80]Didn't hear you complaining then, did I?
[242:08.14]That was wrong.
[242:09.80]You just turned in the wrong order.
[242:11.62]Why was that wrong?
[242:13.48]Maybe read the instructions while the timer runs out.
[242:15.84]Nine seconds, only 170 points.
[242:16.96]I don't think that's going to be a three star.
[242:19.98]What happened to my hair?
[242:22.82]I'm getting flustered.
[242:24.95]Let me fix it.
[242:30.01]Two stars.
[242:30.95]That's nothing.
[242:31.99]I got three stars on my other save before I delete it.
[242:37.34]You didn't put a burger on the patty.
[242:39.72]You just gave them buns with lettuce.
[242:43.38]It's like a McDonald's burger.
[242:44.70]Why do I look like I belong in an 80s sitcom?
[242:46.62]Ban that guy forever.
[242:50.58]100 years.
[242:55.34]Mo means Mo.
[242:55.96]Thank you for the bit.
[243:01.89]Don't overstep my bit bounds, please.
[243:04.21]Don't overstep my bit bounds.
[243:07.64]I wouldn't lean over and overstep your bit bounds on your stream.
[243:11.04]I can't read what it says.
[243:12.00]Can't read what it says.
[243:16.24]Also, hold on, hold on.
[243:22.17]What?
[243:23.73]You just found that.
[243:25.07]It's been in my ear.
[243:26.45]Like for two hours.
[243:27.43]What do you mean it's been in your ear?
[243:28.79]It's been in my ear for like two hours.
[243:30.47]How has this been in your ear?
[243:32.23]I put this down your shirt.
[243:33.73]It was up here for like two hours.
[243:42.35]We're going to have to clean that up later.
[243:44.25]Oh, you want to clean something up?
[243:46.49]Clean this!
[243:47.17]Oh, what is this?
[243:48.35]What is this?
[243:49.51]What is violence?
[243:50.20]You know, what do you mean?
[243:50.82]What is violence?
[243:53.86]He's stabbing the mouth.
[243:54.76]I'm going to draw on you.
[243:56.06]I'm going to draw a mustache on you.
[243:57.82]Come on, let's go.
[244:01.20]Stop.
[244:02.85]Let's go.
[244:08.55]I don't want to be this character.
[244:09.43]I'm a different character.
[244:10.27]You picked the character.
[244:20.04]Alright, be ready.
[244:21.86]It's a soup, three onions.
[244:24.90]You... Everything's pretty far away.
[244:28.39]We're gonna need multiple people here.
[244:29.85]I didn't even know where the cutting board was.
[244:32.71]Pick a job.
[244:33.89]Which side do you want to be on?
[244:35.19]Alright, I got a stew going here.
[244:36.13]I got... Get three tomatoes.
[244:41.33]Well, let's be on top of this one, for real.
[244:42.91]No fucking around.
[244:45.26]On top of it.
[244:51.78]We need, uh, three mushrooms.
[244:52.70]I was told we weren't being on top of it.
[244:59.52]We are.
[245:02.53]Where's the... There it is.
[245:03.15]Okay, we got three tomatoes here.
[245:05.81]Ready to be gone.
[245:08.73]Plate.
[245:09.57]We got those, we got those, uh, mushrooms.
[245:13.37]Another three mushrooms.
[245:14.91]I'll take care of this.
[245:15.39]You get those.
[245:19.69]Any dirty plates?
[245:20.41]Dirty plates.
[245:20.87]Got them.
[245:24.55]I'll get that.
[245:25.05]I'll get that.
[245:25.35]You take care of that.
[245:28.03]I said I would fucking handle that.
[245:29.65]You said, I'll take care of this.
[245:30.87]You take care of that.
[245:31.89]That was oddly unspecific.
[245:33.33]I was going to handle that.
[245:35.01]Three more mushrooms.
[245:38.52]Got two more plates coming up.
[245:42.08]We need three tomatoes.
[245:43.96]Come chop one.
[245:45.12]You got it, sir.
[245:47.58]That's the attitude I want to hear for the rest of the stream.
[245:49.82]No.
[245:52.78]What are going up?
[245:54.96]Put the tomatoes in.
[245:56.58]I gotta wash the dishes.
[245:58.62]You're right there.
[245:59.15]Yeah, but I gotta go get more onions.
[246:01.57]Onions, onions, onions, onions.
[246:02.67]Quick, quick, quick, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[246:03.91]Why don't you just stop standing there and, like, help?
[246:06.83]This has been pretty good so far, actually.
[246:11.18]This has been real fucking good.
[246:12.44]Alright, which, why are you going that way?
[246:13.94]I don't, I fucked up.
[246:14.74]It's alright.
[246:15.04]I need another onion.
[246:20.20]You don't have to mash the button.
[246:21.10]You just have to hit it one time.
[246:22.08]What do you mean, one time?
[246:23.68]I got it!
[246:24.04]Just calm down.
[246:24.66]Three more units.
[246:25.75]Three, three, three, three, three.
[246:26.69]I'll get this one.
[246:27.11]If you don't mash the button, you just hit it one time.
[246:31.47]I don't... I need to do it to help my brain.
[246:37.73]I gotta wash this dish.
[246:40.59]I feel like it goes faster when you mash.
[246:42.45]It does not go faster when you mash.
[246:44.07]Don't fucking talk back to me.
[246:46.90]We are way past that.
[246:47.98]140?
[246:48.72]We're good.
[246:52.79]No shit.
[246:57.61]Way past the talking backstage now.
[247:00.79]Three mushrooms.
[247:02.11]I got it.
[247:11.46]One soup coming out.
[247:13.46]And we need three more tomatoes.
[247:19.38]Efficiency.
[247:20.40]This is exactly what I wanted.
[247:21.52]Efficiency.
[247:22.12]Oh, so this is exactly what I wanted.
[247:28.79]Three mushrooms.
[247:29.59]Are these done?
[247:30.13]Yes, they are.
[247:30.53]Alright, there's three tomatoes.
[247:35.59]Good.
[247:35.91]I'm going to wash another plate.
[247:38.07]That's right.
[247:38.94]Come on.
[247:39.46]This is perfect.
[247:40.06]We're going fine.
[247:40.88]Mushrooms.
[247:42.10]Look, I'm doing tomatoes right now because that's the next order.
[247:44.66]Drop a mushroom down here.
[247:45.42]Bingo.
[247:48.12]I'll get this first one, I'm gonna put it in.
[247:49.34]Grab the tomatoes.
[247:52.62]Bingo, tomato soup.
[247:54.72]Water up.
[247:56.41]We can get one more tomato.
[247:57.51]I'll get this one.
[247:58.67]I got it.
[248:01.23]Three more walnuts, come on.
[248:03.43]Go the other way.
[248:03.97]Go right, right, you go right.
[248:05.19]You.
[248:08.64]Can't switch it up at the very end of the level.
[248:10.68]Get that one.
[248:14.83]See?
[248:15.39]See, you don't know what you're doing over there.
[248:17.05]That was my job for the whole time that we were playing this level.
[248:20.39]You were trying to take my job out from under me?
[248:22.41]That's three stars.
[248:28.17]That is three stars.
[248:37.60]Scream or strip?
[248:38.66]When did I scream?
[248:40.24]Did I scream?
[248:41.80]No, but I did.
[248:43.16]Oh, you screamed.
[248:43.82]Okay.
[248:52.63]Stop hitting the mic.
[248:53.43]People are getting irritated.
[248:55.85]Don't.
[248:57.77]I apologize for him.
[249:00.68]Are you going to pick a different character?
[249:01.76]Do you want to be her again?
[249:04.22]What are you doing?
[249:06.62]Don't you mess with my switch control.
[249:10.44]Press A. You screamed, I'm naked.
[249:14.23]Yeah, back there.
[249:15.91]I was pretending to be a character.
[249:17.43]It's called acting.
[249:23.63]Does Johnny Depp, is Johnny Depp actually a fucking pirate?
[249:27.16]You know what I'm saying?
[249:27.98]Like, what the fuck?

[249:42.73]Um... Why is everything shaking?
[249:48.32]Seems to be a bit of a rift.
[249:49.60]Something's going on here.
[249:50.38]Okay.
[249:50.88]Is this thing cooking?
[249:51.38]Alright, you give me... You put the plates on the... Put the plates on the buns.

[250:03.03]You're still struggling.
[250:03.85]Oh, sorry.
[250:04.11]There's a fucking earthquake going on.
[250:05.79]You've got... Well... A few things beeping here and there.
[250:15.68]That is a skillet.
[250:16.86]It requires a plate.
[250:18.54]We don't have any plates.
[250:23.22]This guy just wants lettuce.
[250:24.93]Get some lettuce.
[250:25.67]We got three patties here.
[250:26.41]You're gonna have to take that.
[250:30.55]Oh, shit.

[250:44.83]One patty.
[250:45.27]Alright, patty on.
[250:47.49]Put the dirty dishes in.
[250:51.27]Doing the dirty- Don't you swear at me in my kitchen.
[250:54.05]Why did I swear at you?
[250:55.37]Just lettuce, right?
[250:57.83]Uh, one patty up.
[251:00.29]This guy just wants a patty, we're good.
[251:01.61]We need lettuce.
[251:02.21]Lettuce.

[251:13.94]Just a regular burger.
[251:14.71]I need three patties over here.

[251:33.74]You just threw a patty on the ground.
[251:34.94]Yeah, I threw it on the ground.
[251:35.82]Who cares?
[251:36.39]Nobody's gonna know.
[251:37.21]You know, it is like McDonald's.
[251:40.57]You dropped something else on the ground, too.
[251:42.79]Apparently.
[251:43.27]Hey, look.
[251:44.09]Skeletons are not where they're supposed to go.
[251:45.57]That's all I'm saying.
[251:47.91]Yeah, how are they not?
[251:52.11]Got a plate?
[251:53.51]Put it on there.
[251:56.08]Where's the patty?
[251:57.86]Come on.
[251:58.54]I got a burger with patty.
[251:59.66]That's it.
[252:00.92]We need tomato lettuce.
[252:03.46]No, don't push me off.
[252:07.21]Burger.

[252:12.84]Alright, we need lettuce and tomato.
[252:13.72]Why don't you put the plate down, maybe cut some lettuce while you're down there.
[252:16.94]I'm gonna come over here, I'm gonna drop the dirty plates.
[252:18.58]There you go.
[252:19.02]I'm gonna put the bun.
[252:23.13]Get the other dirty plates.
[252:24.61]Get it in there.
[252:26.13]There you go.
[252:27.41]I got it.
[252:27.87]You need a bun over here.
[252:28.93]Bingo.
[252:29.47]Right there.
[252:30.77]It's just cooked?
[252:31.73]It's cooked.
[252:33.39]Ready to go.
[252:34.92]Okay, we need lettuce, uh, one meat, uh, apple.
[252:38.04]Uh, lettuce, less lettuce, uh... We need, uh, we need more burger patties, too.
[252:42.20]Got it.
[252:43.68]Got lettuce right here.

[252:45.70]Got no cheeseburgers.
[252:46.76]This one is lettuce, and that's it, right?
[252:49.27]That's good.
[252:50.03]We got dirty dishes.
[252:51.59]Dirty dishes!
[252:52.51]Toss it over there for you, boss.
[252:53.63]We got a bun.
[252:54.15]We got a bun over here for you.
[252:55.15]Take that bun.
[252:55.67]I don't want the bun.
[252:56.83]Toss me a fucking patty.
[252:58.03]I can't.
[253:02.14]See?
[253:04.00]Why don't you help me cut some up?
[253:05.50]We only got 25 seconds.
[253:07.18]We got enough time for like two burgers.
[253:08.88]Oops.
[253:10.34]Can't cook it.
[253:11.12]Put the empties back on their skillet.
[253:15.10]That's a bun.
[253:16.93]I'm trying to... Get the bun on the burger.
[253:18.97]Get the bun on the burger patty.
[253:22.01]Let's just get this one done.
[253:22.79]We need lettuce, tomato.
[253:25.45]Five seconds.
[253:25.89]202.
[253:31.19]That's got to be a winning combination.
[253:33.31]I hope so.
[253:35.06]Three stars.
[253:36.60]Three stars.
[253:37.18]See?
[253:37.38]I thought we were playing a game.
[253:38.30]Jerma knows.
[253:40.45]I know it hurts.
[253:43.21]Etalyx is a better chef than Jerma.
[253:48.21]Who rocked the baby better?
[253:51.57]Hey, we both put it to sleep.
[253:53.11]First try, though.
[253:54.17]Took you like ten minutes.
[253:55.27]It took me two tries.
[253:56.61]Who is a better parent?
[253:58.99]Who won in baseball?
[254:01.19]It doesn't matter.
[254:02.33]That game was fucking terrible.
[254:05.32]I played like a bad game before I even got back downstairs with the drink and was done with it.
[254:10.12]Who's an owl?
[254:15.10]I'm the better dad that's elementary.
[254:17.06]Who dabbed?
[254:20.74]That should be like your negative.
[254:22.94]That should be a negative connotation.
[254:25.14]Who dabbed?
[254:25.68]That should be like, what is this?
[254:27.55]It's like you're getting ready to move on.
[254:30.47]Okay, great.
[254:33.65]At least you can skip it.
[254:39.68]Speaking of, I'm fucking hungry.
[254:41.42]Are you hungry?
[254:41.88]You getting hungry?
[254:42.88]Are you hungry?
[254:44.48]Do we need to take a beer IB sneak snack?
[254:47.08]No, not yet.
[254:47.58]We got a little time.
[254:48.68]We got like an hour.
[254:49.18]I do have to pee though.
[254:54.61]And the BRB sneak snake.
[254:55.62]Alright, BRB like sneak pee.
[254:57.88]We're back.
[254:59.09]BRB.
[255:00.67]Go pee.
[255:00.87]And then we move on to level 2-1.
[255:02.41]And then we're going to play another game and then go pee.
[255:04.38]Just go pee.
[258:48.38]okay so because it is getting late it is getting over to be like 1 30 in the morning we're probably gonna do like another one or two levels of overcooked and probably call it there we're going for like at that point it'd be like probably four and a half five hours or so but uh thank you moomins move for the five dollars
[259:16.30]Bless you, Jerma.
[259:16.90]The last five to ten minutes have made my evening so much better.
[259:19.96]Also, I wanted to say that I was re-watching the live rumble, and I genuinely appreciate how dedicated you are to entertaining us.
[259:25.72]Please keep doing what you're doing.
[259:26.64]Love you.
[259:27.36]Oh, Moo, thank you.
[259:29.90]You can expect, hopefully, in the next, like... Hopefully soon here.
[259:35.13]There's been a lot of talk, I know.
[259:37.53]But there is... There's a lot of... stuff going on.
[259:44.70]Essentially like just look for there's gonna be a relaunch of my main channel and it's gonna happen next year So like January February is where the main channel is gonna relaunch Those are promises, but they are real The main channel will be back with regular content
[260:05.72]Define regular.
[260:06.58]Regular.
[260:09.13]Don't, actually.
[260:10.75]Don't.
[260:13.18]Sometimes.
[260:13.52]No, but that's a true statement.
[260:16.82]Here's what's going to happen.
[260:17.54]I'll give you guys the game plan here.
[260:19.91]Etalyx is going to get like a drink.
[260:21.15]I'll tell you about the game plan.
[260:24.21]He's gone.
[260:26.61]The game plan is there is going to be a Patreon.
[260:30.93]And the Patreon is only going to be for budget stuff.
[260:35.49]I'm not going to get any of that money.
[260:37.27]I'm going to launch a Patreon in January.
[260:41.68]And there's going to be a video on the main channel.
[260:43.63]It's going to be like we're going to make it.
[260:44.97]Hopefully it's funny.
[260:46.35]No, that's at least all I can hope.
[260:48.47]There'll be a main channel video probably like the first or second week of January, hopefully.
[260:54.01]And we're doing a Patreon.
[260:56.52]I've talked about this before, but I guess we can elaborate.
[261:01.04]Patreon money, like I said just five seconds ago, is only going to be for video budgets.
[261:08.50]So no Warner Brothers, no Machinima.
[261:10.80]Like that fell through.
[261:11.60]It's not going to work.
[261:13.02]We kind of, it just didn't work.
[261:15.91]I wanted something and they wanted something and I, it just didn't work.
[261:19.57]So it's not going to happen.
[261:21.39]Anyways, I decided that it was a better idea to just do a Patreon and every cent of that money is going to go into a project.
[261:31.75]That's it.
[261:32.19]That's all there is.
[261:32.77]And there's like probably four or five projects I want to do a year.
[261:35.88]That are going to be fairly large and take a lot of money and... Let's hope it works out.
[261:42.82]I'm going to try.
[261:45.29]Probably for the best... I mean... Anytime you work with a fucking company, it's hard anyways.
[261:50.71]It doesn't matter what the... It doesn't matter what it is.
[261:55.03]Where's the separate Patreon for giving you money?
[261:57.56]You're already doing it.
[261:59.38]You guys have already been doing it.
[262:00.98]There is no separate Patreon for me.
[262:05.23]If you want to contribute to the video projects, you can do that separately on the Patreon.
[262:12.36]You don't like the money that I get from Twitch streams like this is money that I will keep.
[262:17.70]It's money that I'm going to use.
[262:18.70]It's money that I use as like as quote income, right?
[262:21.50]Like whatever you want to call it.
[262:23.77]Patreon money does not go to me.
[262:26.14]That's for hiring camera crews.
[262:28.72]That's for hiring sets.
[262:30.36]That's for renting out a warehouse.
[262:31.64]That's not going to go to anybody.
[262:33.87]It's not like, you know, those scenarios where people make like Kickstarter projects and they give themselves like a fucking $40,000 salary.
[262:41.23]No, like I'm not going to take a fucking salary.
[262:44.71]I want to make videos.
[262:47.04]Did I get a five?
[262:49.42]Just you wait and see.
[262:51.12]Just you wait and see like another couple of weeks and we'll see what happens with that.
[262:56.04]No, not Jerma.
[262:56.68]The next video is... I'm going to give you a hint.

[266:14.64]What I want you to do is we're going to restart this level and you're going to make meat patties because we have to cook meat.
[266:22.38]I don't need your stupid lettuce and tomato.
[266:26.37]Are you sure about that?
[266:27.45]Because there was just a lettuce right there.
[266:28.81]You see the first, but you need burgers.
[266:30.51]You have to have burgers first.
[266:31.69]Go, restart.

[268:53.02]Look at that.
[268:53.46]We need burger patties.
[268:54.74]Alright, I'll throw one too.
[268:58.80]See?

[269:05.57]You said you wanted a burger patty.
[269:07.39]Yeah, I want a burger patty, not a loaf of meat.

[269:48.00]We need lettuce, meat.
[269:48.98]Just take the tomatoes off.
[269:51.92]Gotta chop the meat first.

[269:58.23]He just died twice in a row.
[270:03.81]I've definitely had more than you tonight.
[270:07.42]It's not about drinking, it's about like just coordination.

[270:46.93]Sorry.
[270:47.31]This is a hostile work environment.
[270:48.85]I get pushed onto a moving freeway.
[270:59.05]Somewhere Gordon Ramsay's having a nightmare.
[271:02.53]Probably.
[271:05.12]Gordon Ramsay doesn't have anything on my kitchen.
[271:09.50]He's a good chef.
[271:09.96]Alright, last one.
[271:12.04]This is it.
[271:14.34]Two more.

[271:22.40]True, but like... Okay.
[271:24.26]I'm going to yellow you some more.

[271:39.13]Are they rats?
[271:40.03]How do you stomp on them?
[271:43.03]It gave me like a stomp on the rat option.
[271:44.71]Switch sides.
[271:47.72]No, you go to the middle.
[271:51.23]Got it.
[271:52.11]I'll get the plate.
[271:53.71]You take care of the soup.
[271:55.27]I'll get this shit going.
[271:59.75]I got it.
[272:02.03]It's pretty dumb, but whatever.

[272:07.29]Where's the soup?
[272:07.71]Alright, we need onions.

[272:46.70]Get out of here.
[272:49.70]No!
[272:50.34]There goes the tomato!
[272:52.52]How'd you let that happen?
[272:54.51]You let that fucking happen.
[272:55.45]Listen, listen, we're fine.
[272:57.09]We're still keeping up with the orders.
[272:58.23]I got three more rounds of tomatoes.
[272:59.59]I just need a plate.
[273:00.72]We need clean plates.
[273:02.24]What do you think I'm doing?
[273:03.22]They're taking all the tomatoes.
[273:05.50]They're taking all the tomatoes one by one.
[273:09.32]You're supposed to be on top of that.
[273:10.62]You're supposed to be on top.
[273:11.80]I was cleaning the dishes, actually.
[273:13.16]Cut the tomatoes.
[273:15.40]Cut the tomatoes.
[273:16.20]Get out of the fucking... Cut the tomatoes.

[273:25.90]Come on.
[273:26.22]Listen, they're taking the cut tomatoes away.
[273:28.52]Get the tomatoes in the pot, quick.
[273:34.00]God.
[273:34.78]Fucking damn it.
[273:35.54]Alright.
[273:37.19]I'll do the dishes.
[273:37.77]You take care of the fucking rats.
[273:40.91]Look, we got two dishes already.
[273:42.27]We're good.
[273:42.77]Do I live by Middleborough?
[273:44.33]No, I don't.
[273:45.65]I do not live by Middleborough.
[273:47.61]I know where Middleborough is, but I don't live by it.
[273:50.21]Unfortunately.
[273:51.82]Why is it unfortunately?
[273:53.52]Not unfortunately.
[273:54.22]It's like such a nice place.
[273:56.56]Are we, are we putting them over here?
[273:58.55]Yeah, cook.
[274:00.51]Cause I gotta run all the way back around to get like more.
[274:03.29]I need, I need uh, mushrooms.
[274:05.47]No, you need mushrooms.
[274:10.78]We need like a lot of mushrooms actually, you're right.
[274:19.37]What are you getting so upset about?
[274:21.55]You gotta get that shit.
[274:23.25]I got it.
[274:24.03]I turned it in even.
[274:25.47]More mushrooms.
[274:28.07]We've got too many mushrooms now.
[274:29.47]No, we don't.
[274:29.95]Look at the last order.
[274:31.45]Yeah, that's the last order.
[274:32.33]We need tomatoes first.
[274:33.37]Stop that fucking rat.
[274:34.13]Why are we doing the last order instead of the ones that are about to get canceled?
[274:36.73]Tomatoes.
[274:37.15]Pay attention.
[274:37.53]Tomatoes.
[274:39.15]Get those onions.
[274:41.99]Those are mushrooms, first of all.
[274:44.00]Clean those plates.

[275:02.89]Onions?
[275:03.31]Oh, wait.
[275:03.85]We're not getting onions for two more orders.
[275:05.59]Mushroom.
[275:06.41]Why is the onion order shaking?
[275:08.39]Because it means it's about to get canceled.
[275:11.63]There is a pot with only one tomato in it.
[275:15.13]You're trying to turn it in right now.
[275:16.77]You're going to leave it on the burner.
[275:18.83]There's only eight seconds.
[275:20.34]Get me a tomato.
[275:21.86]Get me a tomato.

[286:11.49]We haven't done safe crack yet.
[286:13.21]We've not done safe crack.
[286:18.93]Yeah, I know.
[286:22.06]Like this?
[286:24.94]This is the worst game.
[286:25.62]This is the worst game I've ever played.
[286:28.37]It is.
[286:28.59]That's not true.
[286:29.75]Is it?
[286:30.73]Is it worse than Troll and I?
[286:32.49]Yeah.
[286:33.17]You didn't play that.
[286:34.05]I did.
[286:34.33]But Troll and I was a game.
[286:36.23]This is just imagination.
[286:38.89]Actually, you know what?
[286:39.43]This is not the worst game I've ever played.
[286:40.96]This can't be the worst game you've ever played.
[286:43.04]I said that about a lot of games, though.
[286:47.08]What's the real worst game?
[286:48.76]What's your least favorite Fast and Furious?
[286:49.94]This is worse than Vaccine.
[286:51.12]What's your least... No, Vaccine was better.
[286:53.85]It was a game.
[286:54.63]Better?
[286:55.21]What's your least favorite?
[286:56.39]Hold your Joy-Con vertically.
[286:57.99]Fast food.
[286:58.93]Fast food?
[287:00.33]Like restaurant or genre?
[287:01.61]It feels a bit different there.
[287:02.83]What's your least favorite fast food?
[287:04.15]Like restaurant?
[287:04.71]Yes.
[287:05.17]I mean, after last night, Burger King.
[287:41.93]Fucking piece of shit.
[287:42.91]Do it again.
[287:49.09]Burger King is dry and nasty.
[287:50.65]Burger King doesn't suck.
[287:52.38]Kind of sucks.
[287:53.88]Look, Burger King is the most delicious fast food, but it's the most disgusting.
[287:58.80]Wendy's, BK, McDonald's.
[288:01.76]Is that the order?
[288:02.66]That's the order.
[288:03.58]Wendy's, I would agree, is better.
[288:05.65]Wendy's is better.
[288:06.85]Wendy's is the best fast food that there is.
[288:10.39]Define fast food, though.
[288:11.67]Actually, Burger King is actually as bad as McDonald's.
[288:14.25]McDonald's has Big Mac.
[288:15.03]The only good thing we had at Burger King were the macaroni hot Cheetos.
[288:20.02]Excuse me.
[288:20.80]Yes, there was.
[288:22.85]That was really good.
[288:24.13]Everything else sucked.
[288:25.09]I didn't say Burger King is the most delicious.
[288:27.32]Did I say that?
[288:28.22]You said Wendy's, Burger King, McDonald's.
[288:29.98]But did I just say Burger King is the most delicious fast food?
[288:32.16]Did I say that?
[288:33.02]I don't know.
[288:33.86]Do you remember that?
[288:34.48]I don't remember that.
[288:35.12]No, no.
[288:36.89]Hardee's.
[288:37.35]No, the best fucking cheeseburger.
[288:38.33]Hardee's is pretty good.
[288:39.21]Don't hit me.
[288:42.13]Are we doing this again?
[288:43.31]Yes.
[288:43.79]I'm fucking winning this time.
[288:46.97]Chick-fil-a is good?
[288:47.83]Chick-fil-a is fucking delicious.
[288:49.31]Yeah.
[288:50.01]Wendy's is delicious.
[288:52.75]A&W is like dead.
[288:54.51]Taco Bell is like, doesn't even count.
[288:56.33]Taco Bell is like a guilty pleasure.
[288:59.17]80% filler.
[289:00.21]But it's good.
[289:01.61]Doritos Locos Crunch.
[289:04.37]That's all I'm saying.
[289:09.53]Where is it?
[289:12.43]How do you do that?
[289:29.79]Where is it?
[289:33.85]Done.
[289:34.25]Oh, I had it right twice in a row.
[289:37.46]Nice work.
[289:38.36]Twice in a row.
[289:39.38]I was sitting there.

[289:43.22]Nintendo.
[289:44.08]Nintendo.
[289:44.88]How the fuck am I supposed to do that?
[289:47.31]I'm getting naked.
[289:48.11]Fucking dumb thing.
[289:54.55]Oh, fuck you.
[289:56.63]Fucking stupid game.
[289:58.55]The imagination game.
[289:59.99]No, we're going back.
[290:04.81]Doing this again.
[290:05.45]Nope, we're going to the next one.
[290:06.81]I won twice in a row.
[290:08.13]Sneaky dice.
[290:08.43]Sneaky fucking sneaky dice.
[290:10.05]Oh, what a fucking $40 great game.
[290:13.77]Sneaky dice.
[290:14.73]I'm breaking something in here.
[290:17.09]And flip it over to roll your dice.
[290:20.01]That's the board you couldn't punch through.
[290:22.03]Oh yeah?
[290:22.65]Couldn't punch through it.
[290:23.68]Hang on, wrap your hand in the towel.
[290:26.42]Wrap your hand in the towel.
[290:28.52]Like more.
[290:29.84]Gonna need more layers.
[290:31.70]Like Trident.
[290:32.62]Don't hold it in front of your face.
[290:37.31]It's like really far in front of my face.
[290:39.07]I have to keep my arms extended.
[290:46.51]Are you gonna do it or not?
[290:49.98]I was trying to make a joke, but I wasn't close enough.
[290:53.58]Here we go.
[290:54.04]One.
[290:56.83]Two.
[290:57.97]Three.
[290:58.51]That's how you do it.
[291:01.62]If that was your face, that would hurt.
[291:03.62]I don't think you can break.
[291:05.74]Don't.
[291:06.24]Don't.
[291:07.26]Don't do that.
[291:08.36]I need this.
[291:09.62]I need this.
[291:10.30]Alright, hold it up.
[291:12.84]Hold it.
[291:13.40]Hold it.
[291:17.38]I needed this.
[291:18.37]I just wanted to see if you could break.
[291:24.87]Hold this up.
[291:27.30]This is like way harder to chop.
[291:30.52]You gotta hold it steady.
[291:32.70]This is twice as hard as it was before.
[291:34.60]Alright, close your eyes.
[291:35.65]Look this way and close your eyes.
[291:36.51]You're not gonna break it though.
[291:37.25]I'm gonna break it.
[291:37.83]Close your eyes and look this way.
[291:38.91]Ready?
[291:39.55]Three, two.
[291:42.75]Hold it.
[291:43.39]Oh.
[291:44.73]I went to fucking karate.
[291:45.83]I know, I saw Kill Bill volume fucking two.
[291:47.80]Like this.
[291:58.14]One.
[292:01.78]Two.
[292:02.14]I'm nervous.
[292:03.00]Are you gonna do it or not?
[292:07.50]No, no, listen, listen, listen.
[292:08.84]Are you gonna do it or not?
[292:10.66]I'm not weak.
[292:15.47]Something else.
[292:16.17]Sure, I will.
[292:17.21]Are you still in the breaking?
[292:18.37]Oh no, not my painting.
[292:20.57]This is my painting.
[292:21.77]Hold this up.
[292:22.53]No.
[292:22.89]I'll show you how strong I am.
[292:24.39]This is Garfield.
[292:25.18]Why don't you hold it up?
[292:26.22]I painted this.
[292:27.12]Why don't you hold this up, buddy?
[292:28.48]I painted this.
[292:30.20]I made this.
[292:31.00]Ready?
[292:31.32]Hold it up.
[292:33.68]I made that.
[292:35.60]Hold this one up.
[292:37.50]How about this one?
[292:38.40]This is okay.
[292:39.14]Well, that's fine.
[292:40.26]Alright.
[292:40.66]Ready?
[292:40.98]That's fine.
[292:41.32]Alright.
[292:42.94]I'm going to go through this.
[292:43.91]You better hold it tight.
[292:44.65]Holding it tight.
[292:45.61]Go this way so the fucking viewers can see.
[292:48.29]Alright.
[292:49.45]Ready?
[292:49.89]Yeah.
[292:50.51]This is solid canvas, by the way.
[292:52.43]This is solid fucking canvas.
[292:53.97]Hurry up.
[292:55.17]One, two, three.
[292:58.78]Hold it up.
[292:59.14]Hold it.
[292:59.96]One, two, three.
[293:05.36]Three.
[293:12.67]Hold it up, hold it up.
[293:13.49]I'm gonna fucking do it.
[293:14.59]Ready?
[293:16.97]This is solid canvas.
[293:20.39]One.
[293:20.61]Hang on, hold on.
[293:21.43]I got it.
[293:22.57]Hold it tight.
[293:23.12]I got it.
[293:24.10]You're not holding it tight.
[293:24.88]Yes, I am.
[293:25.48]One.
[293:25.58]Two.
[293:32.42]I mean, it's broken.
[293:34.26]You're not getting through that.
[293:35.34]Yes, I am.
[293:36.32]Look at it.
[293:37.48]It's broken.
[293:38.10]No, you don't punch it like a normal person.
[293:39.66]You've got to go quick like a jab.
[293:40.82]Ready?
[293:41.16]I think you dislocated my shoulder.
[293:48.47]One.
[293:49.05]It's like there's no resistance.
[293:51.91]Two.
[293:52.93]You broke the plywood.
[293:54.51]And three.
[294:04.54]You got like sprayed.
[294:06.18]I got like splintered.
[294:08.40]I just got splintered.
[294:09.80]You got like sprayed with canvas.
[294:13.14]Look, it's broken, okay?
[294:14.02]Alright, it's done.
[294:14.64]It's done.
[294:14.94]It's over.
[294:15.33]It's broken.
[294:16.47]It's done.
[294:19.63]Okay.
[294:20.56]I got equal and opposite reaction from that.
[294:23.08]Why did this not... This is like real canvas.
[294:26.74]Alright, you do it.
[294:27.76]I can't do it.
[294:28.60]Alright, one, two, three.
[294:30.01]Got it.
[294:30.65]Do you want me to do it?
[294:31.73]No, I don't.
[294:32.67]I'll do it.
[294:33.57]Stop hurting.
[294:35.85]Look at his face, he's fine.
[294:39.91]He's alright.
[294:41.49]Look at the face, he's fine.
[294:44.15]Just don't try that at home.
[294:44.97]Don't do that in front of your friends and think you're funny.
[294:46.39]You're not, it's not funny.
[294:48.49]That was a solid canvas.
[294:55.37]No ads, no bullshit.
[294:56.45]I don't do ads on my stream.
[294:57.47]What are you talking about?
[295:00.76]Alright, anyways.
[295:02.58]What is sneaky dice?
[295:04.48]Should we play sneaky dice?
[295:05.60]You should play sneaky dice.
[295:06.34]This is it.
[295:07.26]This is the end of the stream.
[295:10.40]Look, I don't want to punch.
[295:11.78]I'm not going to punch as hard as I fucking can through a goddamn canvas because I will kill him.
[295:17.31]I'm not going to kill you on stream.
[295:18.75]Shake your Joy-Con and flip it over to roll your dice.
[295:22.39]Hold on, you need to scoot over.
[295:23.75]Scoot over this way.
[295:24.87]Over where?
[295:26.81]I can't- I'm not going to punch through fucking canvas and kill my friend!
[295:30.95]What are you guys, out of your minds?
[295:33.77]What?
[295:38.88]Get over here.
[295:40.50]Alright, I won.
[295:42.60]Turn it.
[295:42.86]I did!
[295:52.52]Thinking.
[295:53.34]Okay.
[295:56.41]Bubbles.
[295:58.39]16.
[295:58.45]How do you... This is just a random game.
[296:01.87]One, two, switch, don't buy it.
[296:03.33]Buy fucking Zelda or Mario Odyssey.
[296:04.99]Don't fucking... Don't fuck up on Christmas this year, guys.
[296:07.29]Thinking, ready, not sure who I want to win.
[296:10.68]Don't fuck up on Christmas this year.
[296:12.30]Max score, 99 to 8.
[296:15.34]Why is Snake Eyes 99?
[296:16.32]I don't know.
[296:19.02]This guy.
[296:20.10]This game's $40.
[296:20.68]Don't buy this.
[296:21.50]Buy Breath of the Wild.
[296:22.55]Buy Mario Odyssey.
[296:23.89]Mario Odyssey is like a 10 out of 10.
[296:25.81]It's a fantastic fucking game.
[296:28.69]Don't buy this game.
[296:29.53]It's a 10 out of 10.
[296:30.19]Raise your flag.
[296:30.79]This game is not good.
[296:32.73]Mario Odyssey is the best game I've ever played.
[296:41.12]Why do you keep doing that?
[296:41.88]You keep turning it over to your face.
[296:43.80]It's because I want people to hear me.
[296:45.34]I want people to understand.
[296:46.67]Why are they dressed as Donald Duck?
[296:48.55]I don't understand.
[296:49.67]Are they supposed to be Donald Duck?
[296:53.03]Are we playing?
[296:54.13]Am I even in this game?
[297:09.98]I'm not even playing this game.
[297:13.99]I'm not even in the game.
[297:16.15]Is that us on the iPad?
[297:18.15]No, there's no camera.
[297:19.03]Alright, redo.
[297:21.45]Redo.
[297:21.97]No, no redo.
[297:22.77]That was a tutorial.
[297:28.21]Alright, this is the last game.
[297:29.17]This is it.
[297:29.75]Then we're going to end the stream.
[297:30.81]No, we're not.
[297:31.23]There's more games in here.
[297:33.62]Let's do more games.
[297:34.68]What do you mean more games?
[297:35.90]There's more.
[297:36.54]There's like one that we do sword fighting.
[297:38.78]You want to play fucking sword fighting?
[297:40.54]I do.
[297:40.82]Of course he does.
[297:41.70]You're like fucking belligerent.
[297:43.32]Alright.
[297:44.22]I'm doing it.
[297:56.40]You were like pulling... I didn't touch that that time.
[297:59.14]I'll have you know.
[298:01.31]Look each other in the eye and nose.
[298:03.63]Down.
[298:05.77]Up.
[298:07.67]Right.
[298:09.30]Right.
[298:11.06]Up.
[298:11.48]Up.
[298:12.38]Down.
[298:14.00]Left.
[298:27.16]There's no game here.
[298:28.42]Who won?
[298:28.72]Tell me who- Is that what you were looking for?
[298:52.56]Nine to nine.
[298:53.26]It was a tie.
[298:54.16]Game select.
[298:54.74]Give us that.
[298:55.14]It was a tie.
[298:56.28]Alright.
[298:56.62]We got soda shake.
[298:57.30]We're at a shave.
[298:58.76]Joy con reaction.
[299:00.02]Don't fucking care.
[299:01.20]Baby.
[299:01.78]No, we're not doing baby.
[299:02.61]Fake draw.
[299:03.85]Baseball eating contest.
[299:07.11]Eating contest.
[299:08.03]Go ahead and start it.
[299:08.79]Eating contest.
[299:09.95]You both suck.
[299:10.63]How are we supposed to know what we're supposed to do?
[299:12.33]Why is this a Target commercial?
[299:15.73]They're all Target commercials.
[299:16.90]Alright.
[299:17.50]So it's facing this way.
[299:18.22]There's an IR motion camera.
[299:23.33]Eat it.
[299:25.59]Once you've found the right position, try to keep your hand and head as still as possible.
[299:32.30]Go!
[299:32.60]Is there a camera here?
[299:55.17]$5 foot long subway.
[299:56.45]Do it.
[299:58.19]Do it.
[299:58.55]So I can see your face.
[300:01.83]Like I was brushing his teeth.
[300:02.97]Alright, here we go.
[300:04.99]Hold the right Joy-Con with the IR motion camera close to you.
[300:07.73]The controllers will be updated.
[300:10.09]Gotta download a fucking controller update?
[300:12.13]It's gotta be able to see us.
[300:15.06]through the IR.
[300:18.10]He wants to know, are you chewing?
[300:19.58]Are you closing your teeth?
[300:21.34]We've got a fairly large update here.
[300:25.81]Where's the camera?
[300:26.87]Why is this downloading a controller update right now?
[300:29.59]Where's the camera?
[300:30.25]I don't see a camera.
[300:30.73]It's gotta be right here.
[300:31.63]Where?
[300:32.17]Right here.
[300:33.05]Where?
[300:33.25]I also, like... There's no camera.
[300:35.27]Hold on.
[300:37.12]Well, there's one on mine.
[300:38.90]I'm going to make a real talk confession.
[300:42.22]I put this in my mouth.
[300:44.82]No, don't touch it.
[300:45.38]I put it in my mouth.
[300:46.00]I don't care.
[300:46.60]Whatever.
[300:48.34]How do you have a camera and this one doesn't?
[300:50.26]Because this is the one we're playing with.
[300:51.48]We're going to be playing with this one.
[300:52.64]That's why I've got to download the update to make sure this mini game works.
[300:56.10]So that thing's been spying on us the whole time.
[301:01.30]Maybe.
[301:02.68]No, I got one too.
[301:03.62]I got an update.
[301:04.12]Where's mine?
[301:05.71]Why is it doing it individually?
[301:07.30]Why not just download the controller update as a whole?
[301:10.38]But I don't have a camera.
[301:12.14]So what is my update doing?
[301:13.28]I don't know.
[301:15.72]You're downloading hot dog technology.
[301:22.50]Okay.
[301:23.32]The left Joy-Con won't be used.
[301:25.53]The left Joy-Con, you have the left Joy-Con.
[301:27.61]So that is a camera.
[301:28.33]Keep your hand and head still.
[301:34.67]Look, I'm doing as still as I can, honestly.
[301:41.62]I can't.
[301:45.50]No, that's like too embarrassing.
[301:58.09]That's it.
[301:58.81]Your turn.
[302:01.45]Your turn.
[302:04.92]Alright, I ate seven and a half sandwiches.
[302:06.96]You got seven and a half sandwiches?
[302:08.44]Here you go.
[302:09.04]Okay.
[302:09.42]Your turn.
[302:10.18]You better do it.
[302:10.80]Hold on.
[302:11.58]I did it, you better do it.
[302:12.48]Wait a second.
[302:14.70]Don't you, don't you, don't chicken out on me.
[302:17.92]Chicken, what do you mean chicken?
[302:18.75]What is it?
[302:19.07]Are we like, what are we doing here?
[302:21.01]You're eating a bunch of sandwiches, five dollar foot long.
[302:25.07]Hold on.
[302:27.17]Hurry up.
[302:27.53]Seven and a half.
[302:28.93]You didn't play again.
[302:29.75]It's just me.
[302:33.25]There you go.
[302:34.02]Is it better?
[302:41.94]You just make sure it's there.
[302:46.95]If it's Joy-Con, wipe off the Joy-Con.
[302:48.85]What are you doing?
[302:51.19]What are you doing?
[302:51.71]What are you doing?
[302:52.19]What are you doing?
[302:52.75]What are you transforming?
[302:56.94]What the fuck are you doing?
[302:58.10]Put me back up.
[303:02.79]Put me back on the right side.
[303:05.64]You're fucking being a dingus right now.
[303:07.72]Get me back upside down.
[303:09.38]Right side up.
[303:10.30]Hold the right Joy-Con with the IR motion camera close to your mouth.
[303:18.58]Now hold that position.
[303:20.00]Get it?
[303:20.30]It's coming up right now.
[303:21.16]Three, two, one.
[303:21.76]Come on.
[303:22.56]One.
[303:23.12]What are you?
[303:24.81]Move it a bit farther away from your mouth.
[303:29.65]No, you can't do it for real.
[303:33.24]That's it.
[303:39.98]Not hungry?
[303:41.23]Not hungry?
[303:42.17]You fucked it all up.
[303:43.41]You've just been dicking around the whole time.
[303:46.15]You didn't even do it.
[303:46.79]You got three and a half.
[303:49.29]I got twice as many.
[303:50.17]Go to the next game.
[303:51.51]You're fucking being a wanker right now.
[303:54.41]A wanker?
[303:56.13]You're being a real fucking wanker right now.
[304:00.41]I think chat would disagree.
[304:02.84]Alright, a filter is... This guy's on his own stream.
[304:06.26]He won't even eat Subway sandwiches.
[304:09.97]Get us out of this.
[304:10.61]You're the one with the controller.
[304:12.27]Take it.
[304:17.83]What's the last one we didn't do?
[304:19.75]Sword fight.
[304:21.30]We didn't do sword fight.
[304:22.22]Copy dance runway.
[304:23.48]Air guitar dance off.
[304:25.04]Do runway.
[304:25.58]Just do runway and get it over with.
[304:27.20]We have to stand up.
[304:28.40]Okay, that's fine.
[304:30.66]No, we don't.
[304:32.56]Alright, we're going to do... Alright, we're going to do sword fight, then we're going to do... No, no, no.
[304:40.44]We're going to do sword fight, then we're going to do runway, then we're going to do air guitar.
[304:43.89]We're going to end on air guitar.
[304:45.11]I'm not doing dance-off, but we'll end on air guitar.
[304:48.65]Three.
[304:49.31]It's like two o'clock in the morning.
[304:51.15]Three minigames.
[304:53.79]Sword fight first.
[304:54.90]Alright, let's sword fight.
[304:55.82]We already did baby like an hour and 45 minutes ago.
[305:05.80]Is this gonna be an audio cue game like we've already played?
[305:16.43]Why are they dressed like Superman?
[305:18.39]I'm not gonna go for 24 hours, are you fucking mental, mate?
[305:25.95]24 hours.
[305:26.37]Did he cut his head off?
[305:27.29]Oh, no, he didn't.
[305:27.83]Sword fight.
[305:29.05]Switch stream.
[305:29.71]We're going to 100% complete Breath of the Wild.
[305:32.61]Switch is not even a good system.
[305:35.73]Get a fucking PS4 for your birthday.
[305:38.15]Don't get this.
[305:39.47]We've got to stand up.
[305:40.99]Do the split screen.
[305:43.05]No, that's too much work right now.
[305:44.67]How did you do it?
[305:45.27]Why didn't you just make a new scene earlier?
[305:46.97]Because it was too much work.
[305:49.38]To attack, release the ZL and ZR button and swing.
[305:53.14]Look, you got, like... If you like Zelda, get a Switch.
[305:57.42]If you like Mario, get a Switch.
[305:59.20]If you like Gears of War, get an Xbox.
[306:02.84]If you like Bloodborne, get a PS4.
[306:03.96]They've got Stardew Valley.
[306:04.90]They've got, like... It's PC and Stardew.
[306:07.79]They've got the other game.
[306:08.49]Yeah, but why would you want to play it on that?
[306:13.57]Nose.
[306:23.20]What?
[306:24.06]I win.
[306:49.53]Get the switch.
[306:51.71]Mario Odyssey is a great game.
[306:56.43]Zelda is apparently pretty fun.
[307:02.64]This is the worst one.
[307:03.76]Alright, you want to play copy dance?
[307:05.58]Did I?
[307:05.80]No, I said runway every time.
[307:06.96]Runway, runway, okay, runway.
[307:08.14]You have to stand up for runway.
[307:13.54]Give me some more room up top.
[307:17.70]Look at these very fashionable people.
[307:24.75]Two, three, four.
[307:27.19]Oh, Garfield.
[307:28.77]You didn't deserve that.
[307:33.13]Garfield sucks.
[307:34.39]Alright, let's get up.
[307:35.61]Get up.
[307:37.88]Oh, watch it.
[307:39.84]What is this?
[307:40.20]Why is this here?
[307:48.92]I don't think this is going to go well for me.
[307:52.37]I didn't even see what we're doing.
[307:59.15]Sway those hips and walk your heart out.
[308:01.49]Sway.
[308:02.23]No, please don't do this.
[308:04.03]Just like just do it.
[308:04.93]You're going to get us in a lot of trouble.
[308:08.63]Stand across from each other.
[308:09.93]There's a chair in the way.
[308:10.79]Put your hands on your hips and face me.
[308:14.33]I thought it said look away from each other.
[308:16.39]Look each other in the eye.
[308:17.39]It says look each other in the eye.
[308:19.07]Step back.
[308:19.47]Take a step back.
[308:20.39]One, two, three, four.
[308:21.41]One, two, three, four.
[308:22.83]Stop.
[308:24.84]Turn around.
[308:25.48]Three, two, one, go.
[308:26.76]One, two, three, four.
[308:29.86]What are we doing?
[308:31.02]What the fuck are we doing?
[308:32.10]I don't understand.
[308:33.32]Get center stage and face the crowd.
[308:35.19]Center stage.
[308:38.11]All together now.
[308:40.01]Ho.
[308:42.19]Ho.
[308:43.43]This is not the crowd.
[308:44.65]This is a fake crowd.
[308:45.73]This is like the.
[308:49.34]Let's see how you did.
[308:50.40]One, two, three, four, five.
[308:54.67]That's like you on a sobriety test right now.
[309:00.54]Looking good at the bottom.
[309:02.18]Looking good with 540 points.
[309:04.10]Look at that posing.
[309:05.76]Look at that posing.
[309:08.30]Sir, you're going to have to get in the fucking police car.
[309:10.99]I won.
[309:12.41]645 points, a C and a D. Apparently you won in poses somehow, but I'm not sure that you did.
[309:20.78]You're not even trying anymore.
[309:21.98]You've given up on your own stream.
[309:23.44]What?
[309:24.26]There's one more game.
[309:25.10]I don't know.
[309:27.54]It's a video game.
[309:28.80]It's a fake audience.
[309:29.76]Alright, air guitar.
[309:32.37]I'm going to kick the shit out of you on this one.
[309:34.75]Just watch.
[309:38.89]Which one do you?
[309:39.41]Do you hold the hand in the strummer?
[309:41.05]You strum with this one.
[309:42.80]Stand front and back.
[309:45.74]Let's see.
[309:47.88]Hey, you ready for the most embarrassing, fucking cringey part of the whole stream?
[309:50.61]Here it comes.
[309:51.05]Are you sure it wasn't the last game?
[309:52.27]No, it's gonna be this one.
[309:54.09]I don't know, these guys look pretty cool.
[309:57.91]Especially the guy in leather shorts.
[310:00.10]No, they don't.
[310:01.30]They don't look cool.
[310:02.20]I need some leather shorts.
[310:03.16]Don't encourage them.
[310:06.52]And boots.
[310:07.30]6520, that's how much I got in Bitcoin.
[310:09.83]How far are we falling?
[310:16.79]Thought we could make it one whole stream without a Bitcoin joke.
[310:20.03]Almost made it, guys.
[310:22.09]We almost made it.
[310:23.07]Here we go.
[310:23.57]He's ready.
[310:23.97]Look who's ready first.
[310:26.80]Let's rock.
[310:28.84]One, two, three, come on.
[310:48.86]Is there something that you do in this game Sports game on the switch.
[311:12.16]This is by far the fucking worst game on switch.
[311:14.74]I
[311:18.69]I won.
[311:20.81]I won.
[311:21.19]I won.
[311:24.41]It should be.
[311:25.69]How did I lose?
[311:26.61]I lost by 100 points.
[311:29.19]I had a better performance.
[311:30.41]You had a better rhythm?
[311:32.29]I have no imagination.
[311:33.69]No, that's not true.
[311:35.43]This game is just like move the gyroscope like five inches to do every game.
[311:40.83]Alright, game select.
[311:41.83]Let's end up with dance off.
[311:43.97]Go.
[311:44.11]This is the hardest one.
[311:44.93]Go.
[311:45.05]Do it.
[311:45.17]You're not even gonna participate.
[311:46.21]Do it.
[311:46.33]Yes, I am.
[311:46.71]Do it.
[311:46.93]Go.
[311:47.19]It's just gonna be me.
[311:48.23]Go.
[311:48.77]Go.
[311:49.01]Dance off.
[311:49.55]Let's do it.
[311:50.45]Dance off.
[311:50.87]End the stream here.
[311:51.47]Dance off.
[311:51.77]This is the end of the stream.
[311:55.27]You have to actually play this one.
[311:56.39]That's fine.
[311:56.69]I will.
[312:00.01]Let's go.
[312:01.17]Dance off.
[312:01.53]One, two, three, four.
[312:03.25]Dance.
[312:04.16]God.
[312:08.34]I haven't had enough of this.
[312:09.62]Stop.
[312:27.07]I feel it.
[312:28.11]I can't really hear it, but I feel it.
[312:29.87]What do we have to do?
[312:31.85]We have to just, like, move to the beat.
[312:33.80]We're gonna have to, like, face each other.
[312:38.62]I don't... I just want to make clear, I don't want to do this.
[312:41.76]One, two.
[312:43.62]One, two, three, four.
[312:45.34]Dance!
[312:47.06]Is there, like, a... Is there instructions, or did you just say dance?
[312:50.95]I got the fucking rhythm here.
[312:52.59]I kicked it as shit.
[312:53.71]What?!
[312:53.83]One, two.
[313:06.46]One, two, three, four, dance!
[313:10.99]Get the fuck away from me.
[313:13.29]This is fucking... I can't hear anything now.
[313:15.59]He took my headphones off.
[313:17.01]That's it.
[313:25.02]That was awesome.
[313:25.58]I only got 2,000 points.
[313:26.78]Because you were going like this.
[313:30.19]Yeah.
[313:31.23]You're just doing this.
[313:33.41]I was keeping the fucking beat.
[313:34.78]I was keeping the beat like this.
[313:39.00]You were like spinning around like an airplane.
[313:41.04]I think I got it.
[313:45.24]I got it like definitely.
[313:50.39]I think I got ripped off on this.
[313:54.79]I don't believe those results.
[313:56.17]5,000 point difference.
[314:01.25]It was about like, bing, bing, bing, bing.
[314:03.08]We were just doing this.
[314:04.80]I was going like this.
[314:05.52]I was doing fucking jets from the fucking West Side Story.
[314:10.15]Not fair.
[314:11.73]No, what do you mean we're doing?
[314:14.15]What else is there to do?
[314:15.33]Have we done everything?
[314:16.83]We've done everything, except for this one.
[314:19.39]Joy-Con rotation.
[314:21.11]This is not one you want to end on.
[314:23.03]No, that was the one we ended on.
[314:24.45]Why'd you click A?
[314:27.37]You pressed A. Now they can see the fucking secrets!
[314:29.81]There's no secrets left!
[314:31.33]Yes, there is.
[314:34.38]Here.
[314:34.80]Here are the two secrets.
[314:35.84]Those are the two secrets.
[314:37.98]Too late, though.
[314:38.74]It's too late, though.
[314:40.46]We didn't have to go to those.
[314:41.90]Sit down on the chair and say your goodbyes.
[314:49.08]Anyways.
[314:51.82]You must destroy the disk.
[314:59.39]It's all digital.
[314:59.89]I got a clue.
[315:00.79]I got a clue.
[315:09.22]No, they can't see.
[315:09.99]It was a launch trailer for Beat Sports.
[315:12.41]Anyways, thank you guys.
[315:15.85]Thank you guys for putting up with the stream.
[315:18.69]How long has it been?
[315:19.87]Three days.
[315:20.31]Five and a half hours almost?
[315:23.77]More like three days.
[315:25.10]Oh, yeah.
[315:25.56]Three full days.
[315:27.58]Back on Friday.
[315:28.80]No, he's not going to be here on Friday.
[315:30.02]He's going to be gone.
[315:31.36]Back on Thursday.
[315:32.16]He's not going to be here on Thursday either.
[315:33.76]He's not going to be here.
[315:35.18]We're back on Thursday for Jackbox Party Pack.
[315:37.30]That's not going to happen.
[315:38.30]On the Nintendo Switch.
[315:40.10]He's not going to be here.
[315:41.32]And we're going to finish Overcooked.
[315:46.45]You know, he's like, promises.
[315:49.48]We're going to do World 2 of Snipperclips.
[315:51.14]We're going to finish the next two levels of Putty Pals.
[315:53.46]It's going to be a repeat of this stream.
[315:55.56]We're going to do Troll and I and figure out how to do the co-op.
[315:57.30]We're going to play Puyo Puyo Tetris against each other.
[316:00.13]Hey, can we get a farewell dab?
[316:02.69]Don't.
[316:03.15]I'm fucking holding his hands down.
[316:05.07]Don't do it.
[316:05.65]Wait, you only need one hand for a dab.
[316:07.37]How many hands do you need for a dab?
[316:08.57]One?
[316:12.68]I saw.
[316:12.96]He moved this hand.
[316:13.98]He was going to do it.
[316:16.14]Alright, he's good.
[316:17.58]I'll do a dab before.
[316:18.60]Let me see.
[316:23.00]Let me look in the recent events.
[316:25.48]If there's enough bits in the recent events, I'll do a dab.
[316:30.87]Hang on.
[316:31.93]Move on.
[316:34.37]Hang on.
[316:36.11]But say goodbye because this is the last stream he's probably going to be on, potentially.
[316:39.69]What are you doing?
[316:43.17]Why are you searching for dab on, like, Google Images?
[316:49.07]There's seven dabs here.
[316:50.25]You're looking for... Looking for dab bits.
[316:55.96]There are no dab bits.
[316:56.88]It's not going to happen.
[316:57.94]There's already dab bits.
[317:02.34]100 bits into the dab fun.
[317:03.50]Someone slapped some massive bits for a dab.
[317:06.90]100 bits for the dab?
[317:07.60]You already did it.
[317:10.89]He's taking over my console.
[317:12.31]He took over my console.
[317:16.21]No, you don't get any money for any dabs.
[317:18.35]200 bits for the dab on crazy dab man?
[317:21.39]We're going to fucking mute in the stream.
[317:24.07]Don't give any money.
[317:25.75]Don't fucking do it.
[317:26.97]That's how we're going to end the stream.
[317:30.13]Don't give $100.
[317:31.41]Don't do it.
[317:31.94]We're both going to dab to end the stream.
[317:34.04]Do not give any money to the stream right now.
[317:36.90]I fucking demand it.
[317:37.96]I command it.
[317:38.76]We're both going to do it to end the stream together.
[317:40.96]We're going to do it the same arm, the same direction, right?
[317:44.61]No.
[317:45.35]This person's name is Jeremy Harrington of Boston.
[317:50.71]Hey, what the fuck?
[317:52.35]Alright, we both gotta do it.
[317:53.41]Don't fucking do it.
[317:54.35]I don't care if it happens.
[317:55.07]I'm not doing it.
[317:55.49]Together.
[317:55.87]It's gotta be an in-sync dab.
[317:58.25]Thank you, peel, peel, peeling for the ten bucks.
[318:01.83]How does this work?
[318:02.49]Am I doing it right?
[318:03.35]I'm not sure.
[318:04.51]Maybe.
[318:06.11]Moo means moo.
[318:06.67]Thanks for sorry for causing trouble, Jerma boy.
[318:08.32]All jokes...
[318:12.06]Fucking don't do it.
[318:13.41]No.
[318:13.61]I see lots of commands.
[318:14.97]I don't care.
[318:15.37]You're not getting a dab.
[318:16.33]You're gonna do it with me.
[318:17.29]We're both gonna do it.
[318:18.93]In the stream.
[318:20.59]We're both gonna do it too in the stream.
[318:22.33]Regardless of bits.
[318:24.80]No bits required.
[318:25.98]Nope.
[318:26.38]Nope.
[318:26.68]I'm not doing it.
[318:27.44]I'm not dabbing.
[318:28.30]But if you have bits.
[318:29.46]I'm 32.
[318:30.66]I'm not gonna dab at 32.
[318:32.04]Hey, listen.
[318:34.43]Who cares?
[318:35.05]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, no dabs, no dabs, not gonna happen.
[318:38.44]Like, who cares, right?
[318:41.16]It makes the people happy.
[318:44.94]You gonna do it with me, or am I gonna do it by myself?
[318:47.08]These are your two options.
[318:48.10]Either I do it by myself, or you're gonna do it with me.
[318:50.18]It's your stream.
[319:00.79]Why are you pressuring me to dab?
[319:06.52]Because I'm a man of the people.
[319:09.04]Dab is fucking... Can I do it really slow?
[319:13.16]No.
[319:13.60]We need to both do it really fast.
[319:15.44]Can I do it in like... You have to bury your face into your elbow.
[319:18.71]Oh, fuck me.
[319:19.69]No, can I just do it like... Can I just go like this?
[319:21.93]We're both going to do one, two, three, and then we're both going to do it really fast.
[319:26.85]Like, it's going to... The faster, the better.
[319:28.25]You've ripped the band-aid off.
[319:29.77]God, no.
[319:30.97]No.
[319:31.31]I refuse.
[319:31.88]I refuse.
[319:32.34]I refuse.
[319:36.21]Yeah, you can go ahead.
[319:36.73]You go ahead and do it.
[319:37.61]I refuse.
[319:37.85]Alright, I'm going to count down.
[319:39.95]I'm going to count down.
[319:41.20]3, 2, 1, go.
[319:41.64]And then we're both going to do it.
[320:01.71]I can see the door.
[320:04.20]I can see the door.
[320:05.44]I'll dab with the fucking vacuum.
[320:06.88]Is that alright?
[320:07.40]No, you gotta do it just normally.
[320:08.88]Sit in your chair.
[320:09.48]I'm doing a vacuum dab or I'm not doing a dab at all.
[320:11.36]Do you understand?
[320:11.90]Sit in the chair.
[320:12.56]You're gonna do a normal one.
[320:13.26]I'm doing a vacuum dab or I'm not doing a dab at all.
[320:17.55]You understand?
[320:18.65]Don't try to joke this.
[320:19.81]Just do it... Don't try to joke this.
[320:22.29]Don't try to joke this.
[320:23.39]Just put this down.
[320:24.93]This is a $375 vacuum.
[320:25.71]Dice it.
[320:26.43]I'm not... I'm not gonna put it down harshly.
[320:38.25]Turn around.

[320:47.77]We're going to do it right arm.
[320:49.08]Start like this.
[320:49.94]Start like this.
[320:50.56]And we're going to do it right arm in.
[320:51.84]Okay.
[320:52.38]Alright.
[320:52.66]Ready?
[320:53.40]Alright.
[320:53.70]We're going to do left arm up.
[320:55.46]Left arm up.
[320:55.98]Make sure there's no rain coming in the window.
[320:57.88]Make sure there's no rain coming in the window.
[320:59.20]You know what I mean?
[320:59.74]I did.
[321:00.18]There's no rain.
[321:01.00]Right arm in.
[321:01.95]Left arm out.
[321:02.71]Right arm in.
[321:04.01]Left arm like this.
[321:05.25]Like that.
[321:05.51]Okay.
[321:05.73]Okay.
[321:07.75]Okay, you ready?
[321:08.93]You're not gonna do it.
[321:10.63]Right arm out, left arm in.
[321:12.19]Swear to me.
[321:13.83]I swear that I fucking am agreeing to rock it out.

[321:24.22]Ready?
[321:24.94]3, 2, 1, go.
[321:31.02]He didn't do it.
[321:33.20]Give me all your bits.
[321:35.81]Not him.
[321:36.35]He doesn't deserve him.
[321:38.31]I'm not gonna let him turn the stream off until he does it.
[321:41.71]He can't mute.
[321:43.09]We gotta mute the stream.
[321:45.65]No, he didn't set up hotkeys for the stream.
[321:47.97]Because I'm terrible.
[321:49.23]He didn't set up hotkeys, so he can't mute until I let him click the button.
[321:52.19]Alright, I'm gonna come back.
[321:53.48]I'm gonna come back.
[321:55.84]Come back.
[321:56.38]Here we are.

[322:12.98]Alright, fine, I'll dab.

[322:19.02]That's good.
[322:22.72]There we go.
[322:23.97]That's better.
[322:24.59]Dab down the street.
[322:48.56]Now it's time for you to die I'm not giving it to the death.
[323:04.50]It's not gonna
[323:08.21]Stop being a wanker.
[323:09.29]I'm not fucking dabbing.
[323:10.57]Stop being a wanker.
[323:11.32]Oh my fucking god.
[323:12.42]Fine.
[323:12.78]Ready?
[323:13.44]Oh, there it is.
[323:14.10]Oh, he dabbed.
[323:14.92]Alright, let me get out of here.
[323:16.32]Goodbye.
[323:16.68]Let me get in the fucking stream.
[323:19.93]Oh my god.
[323:23.97]There we go.
[323:24.69]There it is.
[323:25.41]It's over.
[323:25.87]It's done.
[323:26.35]It's over.
[323:28.11]Hey, listen here, kids.
[323:29.41]Peer pressure works.
[323:30.93]Peer pressure works.
[323:31.79]It's done.
[323:32.28]It's done.
[323:32.82]It's over.
[323:33.26]It's done.
[323:33.94]Just fucking pretend I didn't do it.
[323:35.30]I had to do it.
[323:36.20]I had to.
[323:37.18]There.
[323:37.76]See?
[323:38.42]Oh, no.
[323:38.72]He fucking wiped the sweat off his brow.
[323:40.46]That's all I did.
[323:41.22]He did it.
[323:41.66]Oh, my God.
[323:42.08]I'm fucking so pissed that I did that.
[323:43.74]He did it.
[323:47.62]Don't fucking ever dab.
[323:49.64]Don't do it.
[323:50.30]It's not fucking cool.
[323:51.64]It's a shitty dance.
[323:52.93]It's a fucking meme dance.
[323:54.81]It's like the fucking Bernie.
[323:56.33]It's like the stanky leg.
[323:57.87]It's gonna die.
[323:58.97]Oh, get the fuck out of here with this dab shit.
[324:02.07]Look, and I did like a, I didn't even, no, nothing, nothing.
[324:04.07]Fucking goddammit.
[324:16.90]30-year-old dab loser.
[324:22.73]God damn it.
[324:24.41]I fucking didn't want to do that.
[324:26.33]I did not want... Whatever.
[324:29.53]I'm so... I'm so embarrassed that I did that.
[324:34.26]One more dab.
[324:35.16]Abso-fucking-lutely not.
[324:38.82]I am so embarrassed and ashamed that that had to happen.
[324:42.22]But he would not let me fucking leave unless I did it.
[324:44.78]No, that had to happen.
[324:46.14]He would not let me fucking leave.
[324:47.24]I can't just do it by myself.
[324:48.38]What kind of friend would you be?
[324:49.54]A 30-year-old dabs his reputation into dust.
[324:54.27]What kind of way I can't leave without just being the only one to do it?
[324:57.87]Alright.
[324:58.23]Good night, everybody.
[324:58.85]Thanks for watching.
[324:59.53]Hope you appreciate the dabs.
[325:06.32]Let's do some bits here.
[325:09.13]I'm not dabbing.
[325:10.13]Let's do some bits.
[325:11.87]I would rather donate $500 to charity than dab again.
[325:15.20]Let me read the bits.
[325:15.98]You want to read some bits?
[325:16.68]Yeah, I want to read the bits.
[325:19.20]Okay.
[325:19.32]Let me get over there.
[325:20.36]You want to get over there?
[325:22.22]Alright.
[325:23.10]We'll start from right here.
[325:28.71]We already got this guy.
[325:33.81]Peel appealing.
[325:34.61]Thank you for $10 in bits.
[325:36.25]How does this work?
[325:37.23]You're doing it right.
[325:39.30]Thank you for 200 bits.
[325:40.98]Let me sit down.
[325:41.86]I'm gonna go pee.
[325:42.29]I'll be right back.
[325:43.03]He's going to pee.
[325:43.53]I'm gonna read some bits.
[325:44.49]Thank you for the 200 bits.

[325:52.16]I will take those bits.
[325:53.90]Feitoro, thank you for the hundred bits.
[325:55.91]Peaceful Haley.
[325:57.37]Jordan, this is going to be hard to say.
[325:59.07]Back when you were playing Demon's Souls, I donated and told you to dab.
[326:03.19]I'm the culprit behind the dab on streaming.
[326:06.19]And I apologize, but I will say something to boost your ego.
[326:09.15]You are not... Jordan, you are handsome.
[326:12.66]You're welcome.
[326:13.50]Sorry for the trouble.
[326:14.62]Thank you for peaceful Haley.
[326:16.62]Uh, Kuma, the robot.
[326:19.04]Every time they sit, I think he's yelling.
[326:21.26]I think he is yelling in the other room about dabbing right now.
[326:25.08]Thank you, Kuma, for the bits.
[326:27.10]Hey, Divny!
[326:28.26]This goes into the Daleks dab fund.
[326:30.48]I'm gonna put it in the pocket.
[326:33.06]He is yelling in the other room about dabbing.
[326:36.84]Oh, I hear muffled yelling coming from the other rooms.
[326:45.30]There is stomping going on.
[326:48.22]I hear stomping and yelling right now.
[326:51.95]I know it's probably too far away for you guys to hear, but Edgemont, thank you for the 50 bucks and bits.
[326:57.07]That was a $50 joke.
[326:58.51]Thank you for the $50 bits.
[327:01.94]Screaming into a... I can't bring the cam.
[327:03.98]Okay, the cam is stuck here.
[327:06.80]The cam is stuck here.
[327:09.66]Stix Renegade, thank you for the 100 bits.
[327:11.50]Reverse the curse.
[327:13.80]Moo means moo.
[327:14.50]Thank you for the $5.
[327:16.14]Bless you, Jerma.
[327:17.40]He's blessed.
[327:17.94]He's stomping around, but he's blessed.
[327:21.26]ACDC, and again, moo.
[327:23.54]Thank you once again.
[327:26.22]Abnormality, your dedication is appreciated.
[327:29.73]Hey, Abnormality.
[327:30.77]I remember meeting you in real life.
[327:33.09]Good to see you again.
[327:34.15]Thank you for the $5.
[327:36.29]Here he comes again.
[327:36.97]Did you get it out of your system?
[327:41.85]That's me.
[327:46.08]Alright, where we at?
[327:48.00]MrZombieJesus and Trita DZGin and RedWalrus, thank you for the 100 bits.
[327:54.98]There's a lot.
[327:57.32]Moo and Bang and Drosophilia and Vodkar and Yezzles and BoringBoring, thank you guys.

[328:08.01]Dab on me, says MegaDragon.
[328:10.07]Thank you for the 1-0.
[328:10.59]I already dabbed on him.
[328:12.79]We both fucking did.
[328:13.67]He got dabbed on.
[328:14.69]Never doing that ever again.
[328:16.57]If I didn't have the peer pressure of another person in the room, you'd never see that.
[328:20.23]Plus, alcohol was involved.
[328:22.43]It was.
[328:23.07]Can you move over there so I can take the goddamn pilot seat?
[328:25.69]This is a really more comfortable chair than I've been sitting in the whole time.
[328:29.01]It's not true.
[328:29.39]That's a fucking Stetson.
[328:30.29]Don't fucking give it a rest, okay?
[328:33.58]BenQ.
[328:34.75]Bing.
[328:35.23]Thank you for the $200.
[328:35.95]BenQ.
[328:37.41]Bing.
[328:38.23]Thank you, Shrivel.
[328:39.71]Thank you, Mr. Dr. Helix.
[328:40.89]Abnormality is the one who ran into us at TwitchCon.
[328:43.19]I believe gave us the physical planets.
[328:46.91]Oh, yeah.
[328:47.59]Nice, man.
[328:48.73]If I remember correctly.
[328:50.67]I got a fucking physical emote planets from him.
[328:53.21]It was an engineering project.
[328:54.53]It was really cool.
[328:56.17]Thank you, Abnormality.
[328:59.06]Thanks for the bits, guys.
[329:00.74]Thank you to Boy314, TheUnravelingVodcar, and BangAgain.
[329:05.45]We'll go over there so we can do our goodbyes.
[329:08.05]No, you sit over there, and I'll sit over here.
[329:09.65]No, I refuse.
[329:12.15]Look, this is my captain's chair.
[329:13.95]I'm the captain.
[329:16.43]I'm the captain.
[329:17.07]This is my captain's chair.
[329:19.68]Hey, guys.
[329:20.00]If we were at your house, you could be in your captain's chair.
[329:22.52]Sweet.
[329:28.41]Thanks for hanging out, guys.
[329:29.63]Thank you.
[329:31.31]Etalyx is gone.
[329:32.13]This is the last stream he'll probably be on.
[329:33.89]I hope you enjoyed the local... Yeah, he's not coming back.
[329:38.18]Probably.
[329:39.94]Thank you, Etalyx.
[329:41.74]It's been a lot of fun, actually.
[329:43.38]It's been an absolute blast.
[329:45.18]Maybe he'll come back soon.
[329:46.86]Dabbed and demoted.
[329:49.88]Old champ, thanks for the 500 bits.
[329:51.66]I love you, too.
[329:53.77]32-year-old man throws tantrum on stream.
[329:55.53]Well, that's every stream.
[329:57.05]There's no difference there.
[330:00.21]What changed between... Like, that's what happens on a regular stream, isn't it?
[330:04.48]But good night, everybody.
[330:06.34]Thank you, everybody.
[330:06.90]Goodbye, Etalyx.
[330:09.10]It's been a pleasure.
[330:10.08]Thank you for hanging out on these local co-op streams.
[330:12.64]Thank you for abusing my Switch, throwing it, breaking it.
[330:15.62]I'll buy you a new controller.
[330:17.00]Don't worry.
[330:17.46]It's a fucking cheap third-party one.
[330:22.05]It's a joke.
[330:22.65]I'm kidding.
[330:23.99]These Joy-Cons are $80.
[330:26.53]What a fucking rip-off.
[330:27.98]For two.
[330:28.64]For goddamn Mario.

[330:43.52]It's been a pleasure.
[330:44.57]There might not be a stream on Thursday or Friday because he's still going to be here and we might want to do some stuff in Boston.
[330:53.83]If there's not a stream on Thursday, then there'll be a stream on Sunday or something.
[330:57.95]I'll let you know on Twitter.
[331:00.81]There might not be a stream on Thursday or Friday, but you'll figure that out.

[331:37.60]But if not, then I'll let you know.
[331:38.96]We might be doing something.
[331:40.28]Because he's only going to be here for like another couple days.
[331:41.88]So we want to hang out.
[331:44.47]And he can continue to fucking ruin my streams.
[331:48.10]You know what I mean?
[331:48.78]Like, whoa.
[331:50.64]That was intense.
[331:51.92]The last, like, three streams.
[331:54.88]I've set a precedent that I don't think can match very easily.
[331:59.24]Raising the bar.
[332:00.08]Make sure you go watch his fucking stream.
[332:01.43]He streams every fucking, what?
[332:03.29]What's your schedule?
[332:05.35]Almost yours, but slightly different.
[332:07.05]What is it?
[332:08.61]What is it?
[332:09.41]What's your schedule?
[332:11.14]Tuesday yeah Friday and Saturday and he is guaranteed one dab per stream like he dabs he that's how that says like goodbye He dabs on stream as a goodbye.
[332:20.56]So that's like kind of what he does.

[332:45.25]Mr. Zombie Jesus, thank you for the fucking bits.
[332:50.27]It's hard to catch up with these because when we play on console, we don't have access to the audio, so we can't hear the cues.

[332:59.26]But thank you regardless if you gave any money.
