[00:06.25]Rats.
[00:07.17]We're rats.
[00:08.59]We're the rats.
[00:10.81]We pray at night.
[00:11.91]We stalk at night.
[00:13.39]We're the rats.
[00:15.97]I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules.
[00:20.44]Let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into.
[00:26.50]So sue me for being thorough.
[00:28.24]I want to know that you know what the plan is.
[00:30.62]Look, seriously, mate.
[00:32.40]How many artifacts do we need to steal before you trust me with these jobs?
[00:36.15]Well, I just want to make sure you know what's happening.
[00:38.33]We've got to get the treasure.
[00:39.57]We've got to get out of there.
[00:41.07]And we also have to... And we must get it.
[00:45.29]That's the most important thing.
[00:46.63]So be on your A-game.
[00:47.77]We go now.
[00:50.31]I get to drive the car today because it's my birthday.
[00:52.75]No, don't let him get in the car.
[00:54.41]Please, don't let him.
[00:55.33]Come on, it's my birthday.
[00:56.53]He's driving, whatever.
[00:57.50]Bloody hell.
[00:58.50]Oi, more importantly, since when did we have a rat problem?
[01:01.96]We don't.
[01:02.78]Get in.
[01:04.90]Let's go.
[01:05.46]Speed it up.
[01:06.70]Yeah, that's the speed I'm looking for.
[01:08.87]That's the type of fastness I want.
[01:13.21]I don't even know where you're going at this point.
[01:14.73]We've been driving all night.
[01:15.73]It's my birthday.
[01:17.49]Hey, you... You're just... You're running over a guy right now.
[01:21.77]Are you fucking serious?
[01:25.97]Remind me next time we do this.
[01:27.43]I'll get my nan to drive.
[01:33.76]Um, excuse me, sir.
[01:34.78]I got you over to dancing.
[01:35.86]It's actually $10 to dance in this building.
[01:38.52]You're gonna have to go...
[01:41.13]Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, may I have the attention of the class.
[01:45.13]My name is Dick Dastardly Richard, and I'm here to take the treasure chest that's in the back room.
[01:50.83]Go get it, boys.
[01:52.04]I'll follow you in.
[01:53.66]And let me tell you something, clerk.
[01:55.56]If you so as move a muscle, I'll make sure you stay buried in that ground there.
[02:01.42]Alright, let's go.
[02:08.58]Alright, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[02:10.32]Is the treasure in there?
[02:11.29]Is it in there?
[02:12.23]Yep, it's all here.
[02:14.01]Oh, yes!
[02:15.37]Now that's what I like to hear.
[02:17.07]And now we are invincible!
[02:19.27]Not so fast!
[02:21.53]You stand before Gerard, guardian of the treasure chest of the Mayan temple.
[02:26.96]And I will make sure to gr- Hey!
[02:29.68]Oh, fuck this.
[02:30.44]I'm off.
[02:30.76]Hey, what?
[02:32.26]What are you doing?
[02:36.81]Day at night, we stalk at night.
[02:38.85]We're the rats.
[02:40.31]Alright, yeah, that's cool.
[02:41.53]Yeah, I like rats.
[02:42.47]Nothing bad with rats.
[02:43.85]But let me tell you something.
[02:45.45]Over my dead body are you getting this treasure.
[02:47.83]Rats, rats, rats, rats, rats, rats.
[02:51.59]Look at that flock of birds over there.
[02:54.03]That reminds me of my favorite movie, The Movie.
[02:57.64]And that's your favorite movie too, right?
[03:00.04]Yo, my favorite movie is Frozen.
[03:01.94]I like Elsa and Anna.
[03:03.26]Okay, now I kill you.
[03:08.12]Wow, that's a great pick choice for favorite in this movie.
[03:11.66]I wonder if I have to think that now.
[03:14.32]Now I get to be the giant rat.
[03:15.98]Cool, surprise!
[03:18.36]So you're trying to tell me that inside of this building right here there is a giant rat, among other things, from the giant Pickles.
[03:24.48]Did he say Pickles?
[03:25.73]Or am I putting that in there by myself?
[03:27.51]Whatever, Sergeant Pickles is going to go in here and check it out.
[03:29.99]We're going to make sure everything's okay.
[03:31.69]And give me some candy corn, too.
[03:33.27]That's a weird request, I know, but just get it.
[03:35.53]You guys are gonna drop it and we're gonna be in big trouble.
[03:38.04]So quit messing around.
[03:39.22]I hear somebody coming.
[03:39.88]Somebody put it down, put it down.
[03:41.68]Hey, get in.
[03:44.04]Hello, sir.
[03:44.50]Welcome to the Rat Cafe.
[03:45.96]There's no rats here.
[03:47.54]It's just, uh, hamburgers.
[03:49.42]Ah, that would be real nice if that were true.
[03:52.30]Except it isn't.
[03:53.74]You're a rat, aren't ya?
[03:56.66]No, no, why would that happen?
[03:58.06]That's not us.
[03:58.80]We're just people.
[04:00.64]Man, I'm gonna be taking you in.
[04:02.76]And wouldn't it be funny if this were real?
[04:05.04]I'm just kidding.
[04:06.18]Be careful, though.
[04:06.88]There's apparently a giant rat around.
[04:09.14]You have a good day, officer.
[04:13.76]So, you figure anything out in there?
[04:15.94]Nah, he's clean.
[04:16.90]Let's back to the drawing board.
[04:19.52]Well, that's great.
[04:20.46]I don't know how to draw, so you're gonna have to do the drawing.
[04:34.38]Sergeant Scritchy-Scratch of the Cat Police reporting in.
[04:38.12]You are now relieved of your duty.
[04:39.78]Absolutely, Sergeant.
[04:40.73]You've got it.
[04:41.35]Absolutely.
[04:41.75]We'll be taking off now.
[04:42.97]Thank you for your continued work.
[04:44.63]Thank you.
[04:45.21]Your duty will not go unnoticed.
[04:48.93]What's that on you?
[04:50.15]What?
[04:50.81]Are you wearing a rat on your shoulder?
[04:52.59]Why would I be wearing... What the fuck?
[04:54.60]Let me just...
[04:56.50]Boss, we got big problems.
[04:57.78]The cat police are here.
[04:59.02]Are you kidding me right now, cat police?
[05:01.06]Get us the fuck out of here.
[05:02.72]Drive the car.
[05:03.68]Get us out.
[05:04.44]Let's speed it up.
[05:05.38]We're getting the fuck out of here.
[05:07.54]Come on, gentlemen.
[05:09.78]It's the cat police.
[05:15.38]Good job, cat police.
[05:16.58]You did it again.
[05:17.30]You saved the world.
[05:18.88]And that's what we do as cat police.
[05:21.28]We make the world a better...
