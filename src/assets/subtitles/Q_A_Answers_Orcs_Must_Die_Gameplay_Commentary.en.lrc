[00:01.93]Hey, what's going on guys?
[00:03.31]Jerma here with the answers portion of the Q&A video.
[00:07.47]Thanks everybody so much for all the questions you guys left.
[00:10.79]There was a lot of them and a lot of them were inappropriate.
[00:14.59]I knew I was going to get that, so I don't care.
[00:17.57]Whatever.
[00:18.67]So how this is going to work, I'm gonna answer probably five or six questions, because realistically I can't get to all the questions, can't get to all 500 of them right now.
[00:30.40]So gonna break them down, throw them over some gameplay, 15 minutes at a time, playing Orcs Must Die, five starring a level called Hard Climb.
[00:40.40]And I do it pretty weirdly.
[00:41.68]I'm a weird bastard, you guys know that.
[00:44.10]So, like I was telling you before, the way it's going to work is I pick the top questions that I think are the most relevant, the best ones, or the ones that aren't asked all the time.
[00:53.29]Because I did a Q&A video before, guys.
[00:55.69]If you have never seen that video, it's about 40 minutes long.
[00:59.11]So go watch that video.
[01:00.59]It answers a lot of the common questions I got before, especially the ones that have to do with Team Fortress.
[01:07.05]They're all in my previous Q&A video.
[01:09.15]Go check it out.
[01:10.27]Go look for it in my channel.
[01:11.61]Just type Q&A into the search bar.
[01:14.08]You'll get all the Team Fortress 2 related questions.
[01:17.56]The first question that I want to cover, guys, is one that was asked a lot.
[01:21.76]I've actually been asked this a lot of times.
[01:24.02]A lot of people have asked me this question in the course of my YouTube career.
[01:28.69]And that question is, are you ever going to get into competitive gaming?
[01:33.97]So the answer to that question, guys, is no.
[01:36.33]Probably not.
[01:37.51]Just because any time I take something really, really seriously in a video game, whether that be competitive or trading or something, if I get really, really into it and I really have to spend a lot of time working on my skills, it just doesn't become fun anymore.
[01:50.85]I just don't have the fun that I used to have if I was going to do competitive.
[01:54.33]Because for the most part, guys, I play games for fun.
[01:57.66]When I get online or I log on to Steam, I'm looking to have a fun time.
[02:01.02]I'm not really looking to, you know, dominate some other team or something like that or really get really good at something.
[02:06.02]I just like, it's stress relief.
[02:07.90]It really is stress relief for me, guys.
[02:09.64]When I hop onto a game, it's just fun.
[02:12.23]And I know I top score a lot of games.
[02:14.03]You'll see me with high scores and stuff like that.
[02:15.99]But that really is just because I've been playing games for so long.
[02:20.10]I've been playing video games since I was probably six or seven years old.
[02:24.22]And that was back in the mid-80s.
[02:26.20]That was like 1987 when I first played my first game.
[02:30.04]So that's why I have the reflexes I do and stuff like that.
[02:32.92]So don't think that I'm some kind of gaming god because there are a lot of people that are much better than I am.
[02:38.29]the next question I want to get to is also one that was asked a lot of times and not even in my q and a video people have asked me this in private messages I want to cover this one because it'll stop a lot of you guys from asking it the question is Jerma are you a brony
[02:56.51]Now, before I get into this, guys, I just, I don't know what this is.
[03:02.49]I know the show.
[03:03.95]I know the show.
[03:04.59]I know there's a show that exists called My Little Pony.
[03:07.31]When I was a little kid, my older sister used to watch My Little Pony back in the, like, late 80s.
[03:13.06]So I know the show exists.
[03:14.60]I know they brought it back.
[03:15.52]It's like a revival of an old show, old toy collection.
[03:18.74]But I don't know what a brony is.
[03:21.18]Is that somebody that, like, really likes the show and you, like, you can't, I don't know.
[03:25.30]I don't know.
[03:27.56]So moving on to the next question.
[03:30.22]This is from a guy called Source Neon and he asks, Dear Jerma, do you take this channel seriously and do you plan on expanding this?
[03:39.53]And this is a great question because yes, I do take this channel very, very seriously.
[03:44.63]If you watch my older videos, if you watch any of my newer videos, you see that I have a really high quality of standards for myself.
[03:51.13]So I really try to keep myself at as high quality as I possibly can and I take it very seriously.
[03:56.52]And the next question added to this one is, am I gonna expand this channel?
[04:00.86]That is also yes.
[04:02.92]If you've watched my last month of videos, you'll see that there's a little more variety in here now.
[04:07.86]I wanna try and make this channel a real gaming channel.
[04:11.36]I don't want it to become a strictly Team Fortress 2 channel.
[04:14.72]Because I love video games, guys.
[04:17.00]I love playing video games, so I want to try and cover a lot of games.
[04:20.71]Not a million games, like every single game that comes out, it's not going to be a video on the channel.
[04:24.85]But yes, I want to expand this channel into a more diverse gaming crowd, rather than just Team Fortress 2.
[04:31.05]I did a video on this before, explaining that I want to get into Diablo 3, I want to get into Counter-Strike, I want to get into maybe even some of the other games that are coming out.
[04:38.98]But yeah, I want to expand this channel a lot.
[04:41.52]And I want to be a real gaming channel.
[04:43.70]So, yeah.
[04:44.46]Hope you guys enjoy that.
[04:46.25]The next one up is from Jester Drezel or Drezel.
[04:49.73]Sorry if I'm saying your name wrong.
[04:51.37]Dear Jerma, can you do a facecam while you are playing games?
[04:55.23]If you do, that will be the best thing ever.
[04:58.34]The answer to that one is yeah.
[05:00.46]I'll put a facecam on one of my videos, or a few of my videos.
[05:03.52]Sometimes on my livestream, if you come to my livestream, I have a facecam in the corner, so you get to see my live reactions and stuff like that.
[05:10.36]But yeah, I will do a facecam video, maybe somewhere down the future, in the line.
[05:14.44]You know, why not?
[05:16.26]Next up, this is a really good one.
[05:17.68]I'm glad somebody asked this, because it lets me explain myself and why I'm such a weirdo.
[05:22.39]So, how did you get into doing impersonations and funny voices?
[05:26.84]A.K.A.
[05:27.26]Grandpa and stuff like that.
[05:29.18]So, how I got into doing this, guys.
[05:31.76]Especially Grandpa.
[05:32.56]We'll start with Grandpa.
[05:34.06]So, Grandpa is a character that I created.
[05:36.95]I didn't even really create the character.
[05:38.63]Let me be honest with you.
[05:40.25]My grandmother, my grandmother, not my grandfather, my grandmother used to live here in my house with me, with my family, my mother, my brother, my sister, all of us, my brother, we all lived in the same house.
[05:51.26]Every Sunday, my grandmother would invite all of her friends over.
[05:55.48]She'd invite all of her old bridge friends over, and they would play a game called bridge.
[06:00.61]They would play a card game.
[06:02.61]And I was a little kid.
[06:03.59]I would be sitting down playing games or watching TV in the living room where they were having their bridge game.
[06:09.07]So the whole time I would be sitting there playing these games and subliminally in my brain over and over again, I'd hear things like this.
[06:17.78]Hey, give me the two of hearts.
[06:20.00]No, I said you give me the two of hearts.
[06:22.46]What are you talking about?
[06:25.33]Listen to me, you stupid idiot.
[06:27.39]You took the two of hearts out of the fucking deck, and you stole it.
[06:30.95]And this would go on all night.
[06:33.22]And this would happen every single Sunday.
[06:36.22]So I guess it was just burned in my brain when I was a little kid, listening to this old conversations going on back and forth between like ten different old people.
[06:46.46]That's kind of how I figured out that voice, I guess.
[06:49.39]And secondly, how did I get into doing it?
[06:51.03]Why did I start doing it?
[06:52.05]It was because I used to do online voice acting.
[06:55.47]I used to do flash animation voice acting.
[06:58.12]And I'm starting to slowly, slowly get back into it.
[07:02.62]It's hard to get back into it, though, because I've had a lot of strange medical problems over my life.
[07:07.36]And it's hard to do voices now for a long period of time, but...
[07:10.71]I'm getting back into it sort of, I guess you could say now.
[07:14.41]But yeah, I used to do online flash cartoons.
[07:16.69]And maybe one day I'll show you one of them.
[07:18.65]Maybe.
[07:19.29]We'll see.
[07:20.92]Next up we have a question from Grim Sharon.
[07:24.26]And he or she asks, For a gamer on a budget, I would like to know what kind of PC I should get.
[07:31.29]Custom or should I get a laptop at a major store?
[07:34.13]Remember, budget.
[07:36.29]I like this question a lot because I love computers, and I love talking about computers, and I love talking to people about what they should buy for a computer.
[07:44.43]To answer your question, the best idea when buying a computer, especially for gaming, and if you don't have a whole lot of money, guys, is make sure you get a desktop.
[07:54.62]Desktops are a lot cheaper than laptops for gaming because the laptop parts are just more expensive.
[08:01.00]If you were to buy a computer, a laptop, for, let's say, $1,200,
[08:05.80]you would probably be able to get a desktop with the same amount of power for six or seven hundred bucks.
[08:12.63]Your second part of your question asks if you should buy something at a retail store, and I would probably advise against doing that.
[08:19.89]I know a lot of people got their computers and they're fine, they run games fine, whatever, from a big box store or a retail store, but you have to remember, if you don't know a whole lot about computers, there's really only like two or three computers in that whole store that are even going to have dedicated graphics cards, which is the most important thing when you're going to buy a gaming PC,
[08:39.42]is it has to have a dedicated graphics card.
[08:42.38]See, when you go into those big box stores and you look at all those laptops and all those desktops, for the most part, they're going to have something called onboard graphics, which means if you load up a current generation or future generation game on a PC, it might not even turn on.
[08:59.21]And that's unfortunate because a lot of people just go into those stores thinking, oh, this has a good processor, it's got a lot of RAM, that's cool.
[09:05.66]You need a dedicated GPU.
[09:08.88]my recommendation is to buy from one of the online retailers my favorite is digital storm it's where I got my computers I highly recommend them you pretty much build your own pc there you build everything put all the parts in it you can pick the cheap parts you can pick the cheaper nicer you know it doesn't matter you can pick whatever you want
[09:25.54]They build it, they ship it out to you, and it comes right to your doorstep.
[09:29.00]You can also go to cyberpowerpc.com.
[09:31.74]There's a couple other places.
[09:32.98]There's a lot, actually.
[09:34.00]There's probably at least four or five different online retailers for PCs.
[09:38.78]Another one is if you just go to Newegg, just go to newegg.com and then go to PCs, desktops, and just find one there.
[09:45.31]There's a lot of good deals on Newegg.
[09:47.31]I recommend doing that, but make sure you get a dedicated graphics card inside of your computer or you will be very unhappy.
[09:54.83]Moving right along here, I got this question a bunch of times as well, and I'll answer it because I can talk about it for a minute or two here.
[10:01.68]What games are you excited for?
[10:04.60]I've talked about this before.
[10:06.22]Earlier in this video, I actually said Diablo 3, Counter-Strike Go, but really, guys, the number one game I'm excited for right now is Grand Theft Auto V.
[10:16.21]Holy crap.
[10:17.89]That game is going to be so good.
[10:19.79]If Grand Theft Auto 4 is any indication on how good Grand Theft Auto 5 is going to be, then yeah, it's going to be a permanent no-brainer selection for me.
[10:29.36]I am such a GTA fanboy.
[10:30.86]I love that series so much.
[10:33.06]So definitely expect some Grand Theft Auto 5 content on this channel.
[10:37.93]I'm going to bring it to you hard, guys, because when that game comes out, I'm going to lose my mind.
[10:43.17]Another question here is from a guy named MrAston1995 and he asks me, are you going to try and design a new weapon on the Steam Workshop for Team Fortress 2?
[10:56.06]And the answer to that is no, I am not.
[10:58.96]I am horrible at art and design.
[11:01.72]You really need to know how to model.
[11:03.58]Submitting something to the Steam Workshop kinda has a prerequisite that you need to know what you're doing in art.
[11:10.32]And as a lot of you have seen and a lot of you can tell, I am a terrible art student.
[11:15.32]I can draw stick figures.
[11:16.58]I think that's pretty much all I'm capable of.
[11:19.68]So no, even though I have ideas, I have some ideas that would probably work for the Steam Workshop.
[11:25.50]I just don't have the artistic ability to make those dreams a reality.
[11:30.29]So no.
[11:32.11]This question was asked quite a few times as well.
[11:34.33]This one asks me, how long have you lived in Boston?
[11:37.69]And the answer is, my entire life.
[11:40.27]I have lived, I don't live in downtown Boston, I live in a suburb of Boston.
[11:45.35]I live probably 15, 20 minutes outside the city.
[11:48.28]And I've lived here for 26 years.
[11:50.44]I've never lived in a different spot.
[11:52.36]The only real exception to that is when I went to college.
[11:55.40]I lived in Vermont for college.
[11:57.64]So for four years, so I guess you could say I've lived in Boston for 22 years.
[12:03.81]Because I had four years in college, so I moved back here.
[12:07.31]So yeah, 22 years I've lived in Boston.
[12:10.23]The final question I'm going to get to in this particular video is by a guy named Kuzka.
[12:16.08]And he or she asks, And he says in parentheses, I know the feeling.
[12:20.05]Well...
[12:25.23]When I can't sleep other than playing video games, what I like to do is I like to go to twitch.tv and I like to watch live streams.
[12:32.98]I love watching live streams of people play video games, especially people that play strange video games or strange play styles.
[12:41.14]One thing I will tell you is I am a huge speedrunning fan.
[12:45.96]If you don't know what speedrunning is, speedrunning is when you take a game, like let's say Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time or Mega Man or something like that,
[12:55.64]and you play the game completely, you beat the whole entire game as fast as you possibly can, making no mistakes, no screw-ups, because you want the fastest time in the world.
[13:09.49]Some of these guys are unbelievable at this stuff.
[13:12.95]It's crazy some of the tricks, some of the crazy glitches they pull off.
[13:16.98]It's awesome.
[13:18.24]And a lot of these guys do it live.
[13:20.32]If you go to speedrunslive.com,
[13:23.06]You can see certain streams on who's doing certain runs, and if they're doing races with each other, some guys race each other.
[13:29.73]Like, okay, we're going to play Mega Man X, and the first person to beat the game wins.
[13:34.59]And you can watch in real time these guys going for crazy goals, and to me, that's just really, really good entertainment.
[13:41.30]And that's what I typically will do if I can't sleep.
[13:43.94]I will just load up one of these streams and just watch it, because it's really fun.
[13:48.18]You know, I'll throw in one more question just because I feel like it.
[13:50.99]I got this a lot, too, and I really want to reiterate this to you guys.
[13:54.33]This question is, Jerma, are you ever going to livestream again?
[13:57.35]What happened to your weekly livestreams?
[13:59.27]What the heck's going on?
[14:01.13]And I will answer this right now for you guys.
[14:03.39]I just got really, really busy.
[14:05.19]I really am sorry, guys, but the livestream is not dead.
[14:08.89]I'm just going to start doing it when I have the time.
[14:11.19]I'm really sorry.
[14:12.59]I've just gotten really busy with stuff with MethodGaming.
[14:15.75]I'm now a machinima director.
[14:17.51]So stuff is kind of really piling on top of me and I'm really trying to keep free time for myself too.
[14:22.97]But the live stream will return, I promise you guys.
[14:26.38]Don't worry.
[14:27.42]The gameplay is going to go on for an extra 20 or 30 seconds or so.
[14:30.88]I five-starved the level, so if you want to stick around and watch that, by all means, stick around.
[14:35.10]Thanks, everybody, for all your questions.
[14:37.38]I really do appreciate it.
[14:38.86]For the next Q&A video, I will put another Q&A session up, so you can ask your questions in that video.
[14:44.92]Probably won't be for another few weeks or something like that, but I will put a separate video up for you to ask your questions.
[14:50.80]So thank you so much for watching.
[14:52.62]I really do appreciate it, and I will see you guys next time.
[14:55.64]Take care, everybody.
