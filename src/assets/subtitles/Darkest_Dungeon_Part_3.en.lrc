[00:08.99]Darkest Dungeon, baby.
[00:11.97]You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial, gazing proudly from its stoic perch above the moor.
[00:22.20]I lived all my years in that ancient, rumor-shadowed manor.
[00:26.86]We're going back to Darkest Dungeon.
[00:29.06]Decadence and luxury.
[00:32.12]And yet I began to tire of conventional extravagance.
[00:38.32]Alright, chilling for a bit in a dungeon.
[00:42.18]Dark as dust.
[00:46.66]Give me a minute.
[00:47.72]Let me just, first of all, just say... First of all, here's your apology.
[00:54.22]We're going to turn this off.
[01:00.60]I thought I was going to really like Evil Within 2.
[01:02.22]I really did.
[01:04.08]I didn't like anything about that game.
[01:05.62]Nothing about it.
[01:06.26]Nothing.
[01:06.54]Not one quality of that game that I enjoy.
[01:08.98]Not one.
[01:11.80]I can't tell you one thing I liked about The Evil Within 2.
[01:15.01]I can't do it.
[01:21.69]No.
[01:24.07]Sorry.
[01:32.08]Did I use the walkie-talkie correctly?
[01:35.46]Don't look at that webcam.
[01:36.54]You're giving me anxiety.
[01:40.06]Alright, give me a second.
[01:40.76]Hold on.
[01:41.00]Let me move this down here.
[01:48.42]Old man can't play games.
[01:49.50]That's not the case.
[01:52.19]We just played all of Demon's Souls.
[01:54.19]We just played... I just beat Cuphead in fucking five hours.
[01:57.15]That's not the case.
[01:58.47]The game was a slow, boring, fucking slog mess of a game.
[02:01.27]That's what it was.
[02:02.35]In my opinion.
[02:05.35]Somebody just got shot on the screen.
[02:18.94]Only five hours.
[02:22.64]Fucking evil within two.
[02:23.84]Evil within one.
[02:25.92]Should have fucking seen that coming.
[02:27.72]Honest to God.
[02:32.20]Should have seen it coming.
[02:41.77]And, like, we're talking about AAA releases.
[02:44.15]Don't think I just don't like AAA releases if you don't know what I'm talking about.
[02:47.98]Within three days, two big AAA release games come out, and I love one of them.
[02:51.56]Shadow of War is fucking fantastic.
[02:53.62]It's so much fun.
[02:54.74]It's so much fun.
[02:58.48]It's not a AAA thing for me.
[03:06.55]But remember, these are all opinions.
[03:08.11]Opinions are like eyebrows.
[03:10.65]Everybody's got two of them.
[03:13.33]I'm allowed to have an opinion and a conflicting one, too, potentially.
[03:15.79]Like, everyone's got at least two opinions.
[03:17.17]We all have eyebrows.
[03:19.13]Everyone's allowed to talk the way that they want.
[03:22.83]If you like that game, I'm glad you do.
[03:24.61]I really hope you like it, and I hope you enjoy it.
[03:26.21]I really do.
[03:29.65]But I didn't.
[03:34.81]I like Shadow of War because it's easy.
[03:36.25]I like Shadow of War because it's fun!
[03:42.64]Alright, I forgot to go pee.
[03:43.92]I'm going to pee.
[03:44.34]We'll come back and I'll stream for like another half an hour, hour, something like that.
[03:49.52]Hope you enjoyed The Evil Within 2.
[03:52.60]And if you do enjoy it, I'm glad because you got your $60 worth.
[03:58.32]I really hope you liked it.
[04:00.92]Be right back.
[04:03.90]My shiny forehead.
[04:04.76]You don't like my shiny forehead?
[04:10.66]Be right back.
[06:13.56]Don't blame the car for the driver?
[06:17.14]This is the question that I had to ask earlier.
[06:22.52]This is like a games discussion.
[06:25.14]A video game industry discussion.
[06:29.90]What makes The Evil Within 2 more than a 6 out of 10?
[06:36.05]What is it?
[06:36.53]What's there?
[06:37.57]That hasn't been done before a thousand times.
[06:39.83]Way better.
[06:42.54]Everything that was in that game was just done somewhere else way better.
[06:45.48]Why is it a 9?
[06:46.96]Why is it a 9 out of 10?
[06:47.86]Is it the graphics?
[07:04.45]That's not like a fucking 9 out of 10 game.
[07:09.87]It's okay.
[07:10.28]The game's off.
[07:10.94]Calm down.
[07:11.44]But...
[07:16.40]I'm gonna bring up, I'm gonna bring up, I'm gonna bring up a person.
[07:20.74]And they made a video, and it's still real.
[07:23.36]It's still like, fucking years later, like two or three years later, it's just, it's still true.
[07:29.43]Star's video about, about every single game has to be an 8 out of 10.
[07:35.85]It's still true.
[07:36.99]It's been true for a fucking while.
[07:38.85]And like, I just, by fucking radar beams into the fucking screen, see it.
[07:43.35]And I'm just like, this game's a fucking 8 or 9 out of 10.
[07:48.64]Alright, I guess.
[07:50.79]It's just like a random like, oh, walk through open world.
[07:54.47]Go there.
[07:55.77]Collect that item that's on the ground.
[07:58.55]Shoot that enemy over there.
[08:00.11]Here's a cutscene.
[08:02.03]Nothing happened.
[08:03.91]I didn't get... Did you see... Okay, let's be honest.
[08:05.81]Be honest.
[08:06.17]Be fucking really honest with me.
[08:08.23]Be dead serious with me.
[08:10.68]Did I get scared or like nervous at any part of the game of Evil Within 2?
[08:17.26]Like the game and not the... I'm not talking about like getting frustrated by mechanics.
[08:22.18]It was just nothing there.
[08:23.48]It was just like cut scenes.
[08:24.64]I was like watching a fucking shitty horror movie.
[08:28.98]I might be really opinionated about this, but that's just the way it is.
[08:33.70]It's just like, holy shit.
[08:38.69]I was scared of badmouthing it.
[08:42.72]Alright, but let's move on.
[08:44.24]I've said my piece.
[08:49.96]I've said my piece, but I don't have to say it anymore.
[08:53.38]If you like it, I'm glad you do.
[08:56.20]Okay, let's do a medium dungeon.
[08:58.20]Do I have any level 4s or 5s yet?
[09:01.61]No.
[09:03.55]Okay, let's go with stress level.
[09:07.99]Okay, so we've got bird Jerma can go.
[09:10.85]Real Jerma can go.
[09:15.80]Hey, Tiffany Italic.
[09:17.40]All these names.
[09:18.68]Let's go on an Embark here.
[09:26.69]It's level three.
[09:27.49]Let's go... Trying to remember everything.
[09:31.17]Let's just do this one.
[09:32.07]This is short.
[09:34.27]Just get back in the swing of things here.
[09:38.34]Bird Jerma.
[09:40.86]Who has low strats?
[09:42.38]This team might not be the greatest, but it's kind of all we have to work with.
[09:46.02]Anybody with level 3s?
[09:51.54]I don't have one random dude that's level 3 that can come.
[09:56.68]I mean, it's dangerous to bring somebody like this to a level 3 mission.
[10:05.25]I might not be able to do this.
[10:06.17]I might have to just throw people into a...
[10:09.75]Kind of fucked myself here.
[10:14.25]Should we bring, like, a level one?
[10:20.51]Am I running any mods?
[10:21.43]No, this is just the DLC.
[10:23.13]The game and the DLC.
[10:26.48]No, this is fine.
[10:27.06]Let's just put you in the right spots, people.
[10:34.88]I don't have a tank.
[10:42.13]Not smart, but I kind of don't.
[10:45.18]Let's just do it.
[10:46.02]Why not?
[10:46.40]Who cares?
[10:49.48]Who cares?
[10:50.34]20% protection.
[10:56.06]What do you have for healing?
[11:03.67]Plus 30% healing skills.
[11:11.26]That's great.
[11:16.83]Plus 25% damage.
[11:18.63]I kind of want to give that to you.
[11:21.97]Alright.
[11:22.81]Everybody can have two, but I got it.
[11:24.39]It's been so long since I've really sat down and played this.
[11:27.86]Back to here.
[11:32.16]What the fuck are you going?
[11:33.06]Come on.
[11:36.38]Max HP death.
[11:37.44]Let's just do max HP.
[11:46.03]Speed and... That's fine.
[11:51.79]Okay, let's go.
[11:56.31]I think everyone sees horror and thinks it's a haunted house while forgetting the survival horror genre.
[12:00.33]Look, I am not arguing that the game's not survival horror.
[12:03.74]It's just not a good survival horror game.
[12:07.66]Just because you get like low ammo and die quickly doesn't make it good.
[12:12.00]That just makes it annoying.
[12:16.91]I am not arguing that the game is not a horror game versus survival horror.
[12:21.82]Yeah.
[12:23.60]But it didn't do anything worth even talking about.
[12:31.70]Both of you get on Discord and argue.
[12:33.46]You want to do that?
[12:34.72]You want to have a fucking podcast right now?
[12:40.43]If Etalyx wants to come on and do a podcast about survival horror, I'll do it right now.
[12:49.35]This is fine.
[12:50.03]Give me two keys.
[12:52.15]No.
[12:53.63]Give me two shovels.
[12:56.71]Let's go.
[13:01.60]Just admit that I don't enjoy it because I was bad at it.
[13:06.50]Sure, there you go.
[13:07.76]I was bad at it, I guess.
[13:10.70]I guess.
[13:11.26]Corruption has soaked the soil, sapping all good life from these groves.
[13:15.34]Let us burn out this evil...
[13:19.59]I'm ready to lose.
[13:20.32]Alright, let me just do this.
[13:25.58]This is... You get finale buffed.
[13:28.00]I don't actually want to do that, though.
[13:29.30]This is forward three.
[13:31.61]Shit, I didn't think this through.
[13:34.11]You need to be, like, back here.
[13:38.19]Oh, fuck it.
[13:38.59]Who cares?
[13:42.50]Do it, do it, do it.
[13:44.72]No, no, no, no.
[13:45.67]I don't want this to be like a shit-talking stream.
[13:49.03]I'd rather just chill for like a little while and just play a couple of rounds.
[13:51.37]A brawl is surely brewing.
[13:58.11]Speaking of brawls... Can't really... Can't really do anything about you.
[14:11.08]Can't back out now.
[14:12.16]We'll do it again.
[14:12.68]We'll do it some other time.
[14:16.54]Why is Dead Space Bone the king of survival horror?
[14:18.52]You know, that's a pretty good point.
[14:26.68]You're gonna die on the next turn, so why would I even try?
[14:29.16]Let's buff you.
[14:42.31]What's with the dodges?
[14:53.98]Team Jerva.
[14:54.90]They don't have to be on any team.
[14:58.00]I think it's like a taste thing.
[15:00.36]And my tastes recently are not like the... Every game has to be every genre.
[15:07.85]Which is the problem I have with a lot of AAA games now.
[15:11.74]Let's go...
[15:23.31]It's not a taste thing.
[15:24.17]It's a hair loss taste.
[15:26.51]The thing is, that stream was pretty fun.
[15:29.47]Like, for the first, like, two hours.
[15:41.96]Slime smack.
[15:44.96]Move the face cam.
[15:45.86]Oh, you can't see, like, the health.
[15:47.24]Oh, I'll do this.
[15:52.30]I'll be like an icon.
[15:55.50]I'll be one of the runs down here.
[16:00.92]There.
[16:01.54]There you go.
[16:04.64]Just stab him, crit.
[16:05.90]These guys have so much health.
[16:17.27]The funniest thing was this hair in your mouth.
[16:22.37]How do we get down there?
[16:23.39]I don't know.
[16:30.55]I'm gonna put it like up here.
[16:32.97]Makes more sense.
[16:37.46]I don't even need a face cam anymore.
[16:40.20]Face cam doesn't even need to be here.
[16:43.10]Oh no, you're selfish.
[16:58.14]VOD-ception.
[16:58.94]People watching the VOD are going to be so freaked out when they realize you're actually cam on down in that tiny box.
[17:09.21]Let's keep going.
[17:11.69]What is this one?
[17:12.03]Explore rooms?
[17:13.65]Kill all people in room.
[17:14.97]Got it.
[17:15.31]So I have to explore pretty much everything.
[17:19.99]Put my character's face... Here.
[17:21.85]We'll do this.
[17:25.62]Can I spin this the other way?
[17:46.83]Kind of, right?
[17:56.40]Okay, here we go.
[17:58.90]Forward!
[17:59.32]The match is struck.
[18:05.93]A blazing star is born.
[18:12.31]Oh, fuck on.
[18:21.35]It's not gonna work anymore.
[18:31.42]No, it ain't going to work.
[18:37.78]Oh, well.
[18:43.30]Bopping up and down.
[18:46.17]I'll get it.
[18:48.01]Great is the weapon that cuts on its own.
[18:53.75]You mother fucker!
[18:54.83]No, not going to work.
[19:00.89]That was so loud.
[19:02.00]Alright, I'm taking off the face cam.
[19:06.32]We don't need the face cam anymore.
[19:08.24]Is this the new Snapchat filter?
[19:18.60]Let's put it over the icons.
[19:20.68]No, we can't do that.
[19:25.44]Yeah, if you were sticking around just to check out that Evil Within 2 and you don't really want to watch Darkest Dungeon, I am very much aware.
[19:34.28]So, don't feel bad or anything.
[19:35.74]Thanks for coming.
[19:36.24]Thanks for sticking around.
[19:39.21]Video game, The Industry.
[19:40.45]Let's talk about video games, The Industry.
[19:49.25]With Jerma985.
[19:55.20]You want to see my forehead?
[19:56.20]Oh, what do you got for Blight?
[20:04.51]I do have like a much higher percent chance to hit with it.
[20:08.03]Why not?
[20:08.29]Let's go for it.
[20:10.95]There it is.
[20:11.38]Okay, so he's gonna... He has 102 fucking health.
[20:13.72]Jesus.
[20:15.72]Well, I don't want you to do much damage.
[20:17.54]That'd be not good.
[20:21.36]Should you get Darkest Dungeon?
[20:22.84]The answer to that question is absolutely yes.
[20:25.59]If you like turn-based kind of RPG games.
[20:29.53]It's just fun.
[20:30.29]It's very unfair later from my understanding, but it's still a lot of fun.
[20:35.65]It's very, very, very cool.
[20:39.33]Well, I can't do anything from there.
[20:42.52]This guy can kill me.
[20:47.75]Oh my god, come on.
[20:49.77]Just trying to hit the other guy behind him.
[20:54.57]He's gonna go crazy.
[21:01.30]Four crit!
[21:01.84]That's great!
[21:06.08]He lost a whole squad to stress alone.
[21:14.40]What's his stun at?
[21:16.10]Too high.
[21:18.72]I might just be able to keep hitting him with it.
[21:22.85]Stack it up.
[21:23.27]Come on.
[21:24.23]No!
[21:27.95]Man, I have like a 40% chance to miss that.
[21:37.33]Adding to the Steam wishlist.
[21:40.47]Oh, if this game goes on sale for less than like 10 bucks, it's a steal.
[21:50.52]Yeah, you can get your entire run ruined by just awful RNG.
[21:55.34]But... It's not that terrible.
[22:02.08]I mean, it can be a pain in the ass, but not to a point where you hate the game.
[22:08.42]Steal this game!
[22:11.52]Yeah, make sure you steal it!
[22:14.92]Don't do that.
[22:15.66]Support the developers, buy it on Steam.
[22:22.50]It's a mindless grind?
[22:23.70]I mean, it could be.
[22:29.10]I haven't gotten past, like, obviously, like, the midpoint of some of these areas.
[22:35.03]Gotta go download a car.
[22:46.62]Just you wait.
[22:51.88]That might not be as weird as you think it is eventually here.
[22:55.14]You might be able to download a whole fucking Jeep.
[23:01.27]I was hoping for Shadow of War tonight.
[23:02.83]In 2020 hindsight, I kind of wish I played it too.
[23:10.80]I'm there with you.
[23:11.74]I kind of wish I was playing that tonight too.
[23:20.55]Did this guy die?
[23:24.27]Jesus.
[23:26.81]No, don't kill him.
[23:28.47]What does he have for health?
[23:29.51]He's fine.
[23:32.31]Dead.
[23:35.17]Why did I choose Darkest Dungeon over shadow of war?
[23:36.99]Because...
[23:39.27]I can play, like, a couple of rounds of Darkest Dungeon and then kind of go to bed.
[23:43.23]Because I really wasn't feeling that well tonight either.
[23:46.59]I had a lot of problems, like, with fucking Colitis.
[23:50.16]It was really, really obnoxious.
[23:53.32]But... Playing Shadow of War, you have to kind of commit to do it for a little while.
[24:01.42]And I only wanted to stream for, like, another 30 or 40 minutes.
[24:04.96]So after this, I might actually call it quits after this one or the next one.
[24:10.65]Is it still worth it if you bought it full price?
[24:12.81]Yeah, I think so.
[24:13.93]Remember, don't touch that thing.
[24:20.51]Don't burn that thing.
[24:31.94]For some reason, my brain thought this was a medium mission, so I bought so much random shit.
[24:41.52]Yeah, yeah, yeah get out of here deed to the family house No, just do it go back a little Free stuff
[25:11.50]This should still hit.
[25:12.90]Yes, it will.
[25:15.50]I'm using the HD texture pack for Shadow of War.
[25:18.72]I actually don't know.
[25:20.75]That's a good question.
[25:22.21]I don't know.
[25:24.13]Is that something I have to enable, or is that just enabled by default if you can handle it?
[25:37.54]I tried to buy a house and got outbid.
[25:39.84]What do I do?
[25:42.71]Well, it depends on how much you want that house.
[25:46.10]How badly do you want that house?
[25:48.06]Because then you have to bid a little bit more money.
[25:56.58]You have to download it.
[25:57.42]It's a DLC.
[25:59.20]Oh, okay.
[26:02.68]Maybe.
[26:03.86]I'm not sure if I can handle streaming it.
[26:06.76]And running an Ultra HD texture pack.
[26:11.39]Maybe, we'll see.
[26:11.87]Well, I need to... This thing is worth... This thing's fucking worthless.
[26:20.62]But so is, like, a lot of the food and shit that I have.
[26:23.76]My brain thought this was a medium mission for no reason.
[26:26.09]Uh, just get rid of this.
[26:31.29]So much blood.
[26:36.09]Well, turns out having two shuffles was not a terrible idea.
[26:40.83]It's a buyer's market for houses?
[26:45.69]Is it?
[26:47.14]That's interesting.
[26:52.48]That's interesting!
[27:03.21]I will say, like I've said this before a thousand times, the actor that is this guy in the background, why has he not been in more things?
[27:11.43]Don't you feel like this guy would have gotten a lot more work after this because everyone loves this guy?
[27:23.08]Does the leper suck?
[27:24.06]Nope.
[27:24.32]Leper is the best character in the game.
[27:28.56]He is the best character in the whole game.
[27:31.74]Oh, come on.
[27:34.00]Oh, shit, he had 95% move resistance.
[27:36.20]That was fucking stupid of me.
[27:44.95]No, he's gonna die.
[27:46.45]They both should, actually.
[27:53.36]Nice miss.
[27:58.88]Nice work, team.
[28:01.68]Leper's the worst character in the game.
[28:02.92]I know, that's like the general consensus, right?
[28:04.64]It's like, Leper sucks.
[28:08.52]Okay.
[28:12.43]He might be just doing it for a hobby.
[28:14.87]Yeah, that's very commendable.
[28:21.83]You'll die from that bleed, so I'll just finale you.
[28:28.61]using purge well this is kind of look this is kind of just like an I'm trying to like do just something to end the stream I'm not like kind of I'm like kind of exhausted right now for literally talking about the evil within two for like four hours it's pretty much what we did
[28:50.37]The keys.
[28:54.37]I don't need this shit.
[29:01.71]Or this.
[29:02.35]I don't even care.
[29:03.01]Get rid of it.
[29:03.41]I'll pick one more room anyways.
[29:07.11]Yeah, it's the last room.
[29:17.68]Yeah, if you just trickle it in, I did not like the Evil Within 2 at all.
[29:23.44]I could have clicked that trap, but I didn't.
[29:25.88]It's alright.
[29:35.51]Saying that the game sucks is very subjective, so I can't say that.
[29:41.13]I can't tell you that.
[29:43.75]That's a decision you're going to have to make on your own, you know?
[29:46.84]These guys resist everything.
[29:57.94]See, I'm awful at this game, and I like it.
[29:59.79]Hey, be nice.
[30:08.01]No!
[30:08.07]I wanted to kill him before they did that.
[30:21.95]Just get the guy in front.
[30:28.38]How's Otto?
[30:28.98]Otto's doing fantastic.
[30:30.82]He's upstairs in bed.
[30:36.24]I can't really do anything with this guy.
[30:37.38]Just pray that it hits.
[30:38.68]It definitely won't.
[30:39.42]But, you know, I can still pray.
[30:40.69]Well, it did work.
[30:42.05]Now that person dies.
[30:46.23]Drag that down.
[30:48.43]Go back to card thief.
[30:50.35]Card thief?
[30:52.34]You want some more complaints?
[30:54.12]I mean, we're on a roll here tonight.
[30:58.50]Card Crawl was one of my favorite games.
[31:02.20]Oh, fuck me.
[31:04.54]Card Crawl was one of my favorite games to come out.
[31:06.41]It was a great little fun time waster.
[31:09.19]And Card Thief I thought was really not good.
[31:17.93]It was kind of just all over the place.
[31:22.58]If you played the sequel thing.
[31:26.94]The one time purge was good, I didn't use it.
[31:29.20]Well, it's because after this fight, the stream is ending.
[31:33.21]So, that's why.
[31:35.55]I kind of just like clicking buttons at this point.
[31:37.79]I'm just tired.
[31:38.47]Why don't you use it?
[31:45.75]Do it!
[31:46.49]Clear this one.
[31:47.07]I got it.
[31:50.89]You'll say Card Thief is bad, but not evil within two.
[31:53.37]I didn't... I'm fucking exhausted.
[32:01.67]I'm just gonna open up this chest and fucking just put it all under my bed.
[32:07.85]Can I stun this fucking guy?
[32:09.13]No, of course not.
[32:11.68]I'm gonna be here forever.
[32:14.48]I'm gonna be here forever.
[32:15.68]This is never gonna end.
[32:17.14]They're gonna keep spawning more people.
[32:22.07]The eternal ectoplasm fight.
[32:27.17]This fight's never going to end.
[32:28.57]I'm going to lose.
[32:30.35]So the stream will never end because I'm never going to win or never lose this fight.
[32:38.34]Epic boss battle.
[32:39.94]Here comes a 24 hour fucking stream.
[32:48.12]Just give it to him.
[32:49.08]Who cares?
[32:52.47]Eternal stream.
[32:55.39]Eternal.
[32:56.77]That never ends.
[33:05.18]I'll never make it.
[33:08.16]Alright.
[33:08.62]Can you just kill them?
[33:10.14]Get rid of both.
[33:11.06]Come on.
[33:11.28]You couldn't have crit there.
[33:13.15]Couldn't have done that for me.
[33:14.35]You couldn't have done that for me.
[33:23.17]Do a Rick and Morty impression?
[33:24.38]I think I did that the other night and everybody hated it.
[33:28.14]Nobody liked it.
[33:28.72]I thought it was bad.
[33:29.60]Even if you didn't like the game, I still appreciate your dedication to at least try it and understand why you didn't like it.
[33:44.88]Thanks for the stream and hope your colitis gets better.
[33:46.56]Well, thank god fucking damn it.
[33:47.83]Here comes another one.
[33:49.45]Well, thanks, dude.
[33:52.74]I hope I make these type of things abundantly clear.
[33:55.55]If I don't, then I want to make sure I do.
[33:56.97]I... I don't want you to think that I think that your opinion is wrong if you like the evil within too.
[34:10.22]I just don't.
[34:10.62]Alright.
[34:12.80]Die!
[34:17.93]God damn it.
[34:18.73]Alright.
[34:19.01]Now, please, just kill this guy now.
[34:21.42]Get rid of him now so I can go to bed.
[34:24.04]God, I can go to bed.
[34:26.86]That's good.
[34:27.22]Thanks for saying that, but I think your opinion is wrong.
[34:29.08]Well, I think... I'm not going to say anything.
[34:39.67]Get rid of this dumb thing.
[34:40.81]There's another battle room?
[34:43.89]Are you serious?
[34:46.54]What the fuck?
[34:47.36]There's too many battle rooms.
[34:51.78]And I got diseased.
[34:58.58]Oh my god.
[35:01.87]What the hell?
[35:04.81]I just wanted this to be easy.
[35:06.43]I wanted it to be easy.
[35:10.53]Stun percent chance.
[35:11.85]Ay yi yi.
[35:15.71]Well, let's hope they hit.
[35:17.29]Am I going to play Destiny 2?
[35:31.22]I didn't play Destiny 1.
[35:32.74]It wasn't necessarily something I really cared about.
[35:38.37]Destiny.
[35:41.93]Lash of the tail.
[35:42.93]I'm going to get stressed out and they're all going to die.
[35:45.71]He's almost there.
[35:46.39]Yeah, guardrails are really easy to kill.
[35:53.49]That's at least good.
[35:54.24]They don't have very much health.
[36:04.24]It's your destiny to never play that game.
[36:15.75]Yeah.
[36:47.47]Now he'll die from the bleed.
[36:48.59]They're both going to die from the blight, so this is fine.
[36:57.05]None of this matters.
[36:58.21]Just throw it.
[36:59.92]Just throw the grenade.
[37:00.84]They're all dead anyways.
[37:07.60]The story sucks, the gameplay is grinding, and my asshole is falling apart.
[37:10.82]Well, that doesn't sound good.
[37:11.84]We're going to get rid of the...
[37:17.55]Just put this on like you.
[37:21.44]Take that.
[37:22.20]And then this is only 375, so who cares.
[37:26.14]Um... 1200.
[37:27.44]Yeah, fucking who cares.
[37:31.06]375 is nothing.
[37:32.62]Alright, let's eat the rest of the food.
[37:33.84]And get this over with here.
[37:40.66]Get on in.
[37:46.07]This is the easiest one of the whole entire dungeon.
[37:50.11]Like, uh, what?
[37:55.39]This is by far the easiest one.
[38:01.75]Am I ever going to change the sub sounds again?
[38:03.43]You know, that's a very good question.
[38:08.08]Why did I bring a plague doctor here, by the way?
[38:10.24]What a dummy.
[38:19.42]The answer is, I'm gonna say yes.
[38:20.96]I hope it's yes.
[38:23.84]I gotta figure out, I haven't really thought of what I want it to be.
[38:26.76]Like, what do I, what would I want it to be?
[38:30.98]Something quick.
[38:31.58]That doesn't take away from, like, what's going on on the screen.
[38:34.48]I don't know.
[38:41.80]Make it the wire head laugh?
[38:43.08]I could.
[38:44.40]There's a lot of random things I could make it, I guess.
[38:47.27]Go back to Orson Welles.
[38:54.04]That would be a trip.
[38:59.18]No chest in here, so I don't even need the key.
[39:00.74]You've been playing Mario... replaying Mario RPG.
[39:06.54]I'm having a blast.
[39:07.18]Mario RPG is fucking fantastic.
[39:11.42]That game is awesome.
[39:14.14]That was so before its time.
[39:16.92]And unfortunately, that was one of the last games to release for Super Nintendo, right?
[39:21.34]So, I didn't really get that much attention, I don't think.
[39:28.26]Like, the fake isometric 3D.
[39:30.94]My game was very good.
[39:36.92]Bring back the French champagne.
[39:40.06]I'd have to go find someone else he said that was, like, fucked up.
[39:48.59]Oh, we're gonna play Mario Odyssey.
[39:49.55]Mario Odyssey looks insane.
[39:54.35]It looks so good.
[39:56.19]Like, it looks too good.
[39:59.26]You know what I'm saying?
[40:01.63]Mario Odyssey looks like they made that game over like 12 years.
[40:06.79]It looks so good.
[40:09.42]I don't even have a Switch.
[40:17.28]I have to go buy a Switch to play that game.
[40:19.01]That's why I would own it.
[40:25.92]Looks like a good updated Mario 64.
[40:27.40]I mean, that's a really good thing, considering that I think they've been trying for years to replicate that same feeling from Mario 64, and they kind of had it in some of the other games.
[40:40.15]Mario Galaxy was really good for its time, you know, when it came up with the Wii.
[40:44.09]It was really, really great.
[40:48.87]This is taking a lot longer than I thought it was going to take.
[40:54.61]Can I please just, like, throw this at you and have this die?
[40:57.63]No.
[40:59.47]Come on.
[41:00.37]Whack him.
[41:06.39]Just have Ben pay for the Switch.
[41:08.32]Yeah, you know what?
[41:09.24]That's true.
[41:11.08]He's given enough money for me to buy, like, three Switches in the last, like, 30 days.
[41:25.07]A hat in time also looks really great.
[41:29.25]Hypo worked on that game, if you guys don't know.
[41:32.34]It's got like a legendary.
[41:33.44]Okay.
[41:33.88]Well, cool.
[41:34.50]Thanks for the legendary.
[41:36.04]Let's go.
[41:36.74]Very nice.
[42:00.73]Will you play The Evil Within 2 on stream?
[42:04.90]I'm so sad that that, like, just... It started off fun, we were having a good time, and then once it became painfully obvious that we were just going from house to house, listening to cutscenes, and trying not to die by the random, unkillable enemies, it was just like, it just, like, burnt a hole for me.
[42:28.71]That's not the game I was expecting.
[42:30.91]At all.
[42:33.71]Oh well.
[42:35.58]Hey, you can't win them all.
[42:38.06]Sometimes you need to lose.
[42:43.38]Strict activities.
[42:45.58]Alright, guys.
[42:47.52]Just wanted to chill and just relax and wind down and play a round of that.
[42:52.33]So, I will see you guys again...
[42:56.65]either Sunday or Monday.
[42:57.99]I have not decided.
[42:58.81]I wanted to do like a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday thing, but might actually just do Sunday.
[43:04.91]It's possible I could go Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[43:08.82]We'll see.
[43:09.12]And yes, I'm going to go over the bits.
[43:15.94]I'll make sure to go over them.
[43:20.57]There's a lot of options.
[43:22.41]You'll see something.
[43:23.57]I promise.
[43:26.48]But before we go, I want to... Let's just switch this over here.
[43:34.89]That's the end of this stream.
[43:39.35]Sir Feline, thanks for the $5.
[43:40.13]Sir, I need a $5 joke as soon as possible.
[43:43.54]Lives depend on it.
[43:44.70]Are you about to fall off a cliff?
[43:47.56]Are you holding your mouse with one hand and scrolling over the chat?
[43:52.33]Alright, fuck, okay.
[43:53.64]If you like, if you like doing like a cliffhanger situation, then fine, let's go for it.
[43:59.74]Um... Let me think here.
[44:05.87]Um... Uh-oh.
[44:08.87]Uh-oh.
[44:09.17]Uh-oh!
[44:17.48]I think I'm too tired.
[44:18.80]Uh... Quick!
[44:20.70]He's panicking.
[44:21.94]Quick, say something the Anoli audience will fuckin' eat up.
[44:27.10]Uh... Ruh... RAT MOVIE!
[44:32.02]Remember RAT MOVIE 2?
[44:39.33]Google's funniest one-line joke.
[44:43.47]Oh shit, he's already dead.
[44:45.09]He already fell off the cliff.
[44:46.78]That took too long.
[44:48.64]He just, like, slipped and was like, Jabba, what the fuuuuuck?
[44:54.82]And landed in the water.
[44:57.80]He already fell.
[44:59.08]Well, thank you, Sir Feline.
[44:59.91]Thanks for the five dollars.
[45:03.47]Thank you, Radio Vidya, for the one buck.
[45:05.05]If you don't like TEW2's pacing, don't go watch Blade Runner.
[45:12.12]Also, are you going to play Wolfenstein 2?
[45:14.80]Maybe.
[45:16.24]We'll cross that bridge when it's starting to come out.
[45:19.42]When does it come out?
[45:20.00]Soon?
[45:22.80]Dan with Wings, thanks for 10 bucks.
[45:25.58]Send me back into the fight.
[45:27.38]Also, your opinion of TEW2 is just objectively right.
[45:35.57]Well, if you agree with me, then, well, first of all, thanks, Dan.
[45:38.71]And Dan, you're also, yeah, where are you?
[45:41.25]There you are.
[45:42.90]You are the leper.
[45:44.52]You will forever be the leper.
[45:49.52]Uh, but yes.
[45:50.04]I don't know.
[45:51.74]It just soured on me real quick.
[45:54.10]And it started out so well.
[45:56.48]I just fucking ate a goddamn Sour Patch Kid after like two hours.
[46:03.11]But anyways, thank you, dude.
[46:04.81]Sir Feline, thanks for the ten bucks.
[46:06.03]Next Crusader named Denzer.
[46:07.77]And I'll do that right now.
[46:08.59]Why not here?
[46:09.05]Let's just go get one.
[46:13.69]shit how about this there we go this is this is father alright back to what we were doing thank you uh sir feeling again with the 10 bucks
[46:41.21]Also, thank you to Upward Fern again.
[46:42.69]I should try Valiant Hearts.
[46:44.95]Looks like the art style is pretty similar.
[46:47.19]I've seen it before.
[46:47.81]It's an older game, right?
[46:49.89]That's from at least four or five years ago, right?
[46:52.44]Maybe.
[46:53.64]Thanks, dude.
[46:58.14]Please stop playing Discount Last of Us.
[47:00.16]Also, turn on an air conditioner.
[47:01.50]You look like a roasted pig.
[47:03.16]Thank you, Hen Hen.
[47:04.92]Come on, man.
[47:07.83]What the hell?
[47:09.17]This is not nice.
[47:15.16]Uh, Stix.
[47:16.46]Stix gave five bucks also.
[47:20.18]Cherry is the worst fruit snack flavor in fucking history.
[47:22.98]Stop filling half of my Lifesaver gummies bags with cherry, you shitty candy manufacturers.
[47:27.63]Who are you talking to?
[47:29.91]Is there like a Twitch stream right now of fucking Jolly Ranchers?
[47:34.38]Like, is Haribo streaming right now?
[47:36.06]And you're like, oh fuck, I was in the wrong chat.
[47:44.72]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[47:46.70]Coolcat, thanks for the $5.
[47:47.66]Make sure you buy upgrades.
[47:52.53]If you don't, you're going to shit your pants and probably give up.
[47:54.37]Well, I didn't shit my pants, but I gave up.
[47:56.17]That's for sure.
[47:57.13]Thank you, though.
[48:00.57]And I think that's it.
[48:04.22]Thanks, everybody.
[48:06.00]I'll catch you guys on Sunday or Monday.
[48:09.02]Tentatively.
[48:11.32]We'll get back into it.
[48:13.48]Thanks for bearing with me tonight.
[48:14.66]I started late.
[48:15.38]Didn't feel great.
[48:16.42]And then obviously like an hour or two went by and started to like not really want to play that game.
[48:22.33]No one to hold them.
[48:22.90]No one to fold them.
[48:24.34]Take care, everybody.
[48:25.14]I'll see you on Sunday or Monday.
[48:26.88]Have a good night.

[49:35.77]you
[50:10.60]you
[51:42.79]Do you understand the point?
[51:44.07]Nothing matters.
[51:45.85]I can't... I was trying to do something else and it just blew it.
[51:50.50]I was trying to... You know what?
[51:51.74]Don't even worry about it.
[51:52.44]Oh, wait.
[51:55.10]Those are Angela's hands.
[51:58.72]She was here playing funny games.
[52:01.83]Good night, guys.
