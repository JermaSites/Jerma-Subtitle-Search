[00:24.63]Hello, everyone.
[00:25.51]This is the official podcast, the four typical boys here this week, Jackson, Andrew, Charlie and Kaya, where we've got a guest on this official couch this week, Jerma.
[00:35.71]How are you going, man?
[00:36.84]I'm doing good.
[00:37.54]I'm not a typical boy.
[00:38.82]I'm the fifth boy, right?
[00:40.70]You're a man among boys.
[00:42.73]Am I a man?
[00:43.65]Am I old man here?
[00:45.43]You're probably in the same age bracket we all are.
[00:47.47]I don't think we're geriatrics patients yet.
[00:49.23]Okay.
[00:50.81]Well, I would consider myself that.
[00:53.53]Uh, 26.
[00:54.47]Oh!
[00:54.93]Oh, yeah.
[00:55.33]We got some ties running around.
[00:56.98]And that is a lie.
[00:58.20]I'm 32.
[00:58.32]Oh.
[00:58.62]Oh.
[01:00.26]Alright, you win.
[01:03.60]Yeah, 32.
[01:04.68]You got us.
[01:06.16]Grandpa, could you speak up a little bit?
[01:07.42]I couldn't hear you.
[01:09.95]Yeah, I'm not that old yet.
[01:11.55]No, you're still young and spry.
[01:13.61]I want to get right into something that I really wanted to talk about as quickly as possible.
[01:17.39]Are you an actual fan of wrestling?
[01:18.91]I know you've pretty much revolutionized wrestling with the Jerma Rumble and even inspired, some would say, the better alternative, which is the Sodden Super Slam Smackdown.
[01:27.58]But are you yourself an actual fan of wrestling?
[01:30.74]Oh, yeah.
[01:31.28]Huge.
[01:32.20]I mean, well, hold on a second.
[01:33.54]Are we talking before 2000 or after 2000?
[01:36.10]No, Attitude Era.
[01:37.75]I don't consider anything after Attitude Era even wrestling.
[01:40.47]There's a very strong, clear definition between those two.
[01:43.99]Yeah, because nowadays you've got, like, first name, last name, guy in a Speedo versus first name, last name, guy in a Speedo.
[01:49.29]I don't like it.
[01:49.79]No, it's very boring.
[01:52.15]Back when, like, Mankind was, like, eating people and shit, like, oh, yeah, I'm all for it.
[01:56.33]I used to love wrestling.
[01:57.99]God mankind McFucking Foley also the host of the robot Wars.
[02:02.30]What a versatile talent Oh, not not even just a robot Wars.
[02:06.10]He was three fucking wrestlers in WWF He was cactus Jack dude love you remember this shit He played like five different men wrestling each other.
[02:15.54]It was great.
[02:16.48]I think he's the only guy to do that Yeah, he was like he was basically the nutty professor of the wrestling ring.
[02:21.32]I totally forgot about that
[02:23.30]He'd run on stage and call someone out as Dude Love and then run back, quickly change and come back as Cactus Jack.
[02:29.35]What did Dude Love say about me?
[02:30.65]How dare he?
[02:32.75]If I ever met him in person in the same room at the same time, I'd tell him what I think.
[02:38.28]God, I wish I was that talented.
[02:40.70]I wish wrestling was still that way, man.
[02:42.44]That shit was so fun to watch.
[02:44.70]Those guys used to hurt each other, too.
[02:45.93]It used to be for real.
[02:47.95]The joke was always, oh, wrestling's fake.
[02:50.15]But it wasn't.
[02:51.37]Those guys were actually jumping off buildings.
[02:53.76]Those guys would do it.
[02:56.26]Well, technically, the hell in a cell is a building, isn't it?
[02:58.91]Yeah, to an extent.
[03:00.09]To clarify, Jackson.
[03:01.75]It's like four stories tall.
[03:03.41]It is really fucking up there, right?
[03:05.19]No, it's super up there.
[03:06.11]Clarify, did anyone die?
[03:07.55]Was this suicide?
[03:08.67]What's happening here?
[03:09.45]No, no.
[03:09.81]Remember when Mick Foley got thrown off the top of the hell of the cell?
[03:12.28]Broke both of his kidneys?
[03:14.22]Through the always Spanish announcer table?
[03:17.94]Wait, can you break kidneys?
[03:21.96]It doesn't sound like something can break.
[03:23.26]There's not a goddamn thing in mankind's body that hasn't been broken at least once.
[03:27.28]And that was actually a big part of his biography, where he just went down his list of injuries, and I think he named every single body part he owned.
[03:34.87]But to clarify, Jackson, because I don't know if you guys had anything comparable in Australia, the premise of the wrestling matches was fake, like, oh, I blew up this man's car and fucked his wife and he's mad at me now.
[03:45.95]Like, obviously you didn't blow up his car.
[03:47.49]He may have fucked his wife, but you didn't blow up a car.
[03:50.09]And the moves were choreographed, but they did actually fucking hurt themselves and really put their body through the slammer.
[03:57.15]So why even act then?
[03:58.40]Why not just fucking do the proper shit?
[04:01.40]Beatrix, man, it's fun.
[04:02.70]It creates a fun story, you get to root for some people, you get to be on people's sides, it's a lot of fun.
[04:06.98]Kai and I went down the Chikara wrestling rabbit hole, and it was really enjoyable, like even unironically to a certain degree.
[04:14.07]There's some wacky shit, not just like the WWE, like WWF.
[04:19.57]There are some indie organizations that still do the crazy shit.
[04:23.13]Isn't that the one that sees pandas and shit?
[04:26.37]Used to be ECW, but ECW.
[04:29.90]Yeah, the WWF was before WWE.
[04:32.62]That one's dead right now.
[04:33.72]I think the main ones are... I think Chikara's on the come up and then King of Poseidon's staff or something.
[04:41.38]Something like that, I don't remember.
[04:43.75]Yeah, it's all gods fighting each other.
[04:45.73]I would absolutely watch that.
[04:47.15]I got confused because there is another WWF, which is the Worldwide Fund for Nature, and that says, like, animals and shit.
[04:54.75]They sued the WWF.
[04:56.97]The World Wildlife Foundation sued the WWF, and that's why they had to change to WWE.
[05:03.63]Yeah, like 25 years later, they were like, oh, you know what?
[05:06.53]You've been doing this whole WWF thing, World Wrestling Federation, for like 30 fucking years.
[05:11.28]You can't do that anymore.
[05:12.74]We're the World Wildlife Foundation.
[05:15.38]Really?
[05:15.66]They got strong-armed by a panda foundation, basically.
[05:20.53]Yeah, but Vince McMahon got his revenge when Mankind McFoley wrestled a panda.
[05:27.23]I was about to say, you say that as a joke, and yet that sounds completely believable for early 2000s WWE.
[05:32.98]It very well may have happened, I don't know.
[05:35.00]There's few things mankind hasn't wrestled.
[05:38.51]Including himself.
[05:40.15]Yeah.
[05:42.39]Isn't he like the commissioner now or something?
[05:43.95]He's doing like some weird, I'm like the guy that makes the matches now, right?
[05:47.79]I don't think so.
[05:48.71]I think he's... I don't know.
[05:50.51]If he's not dead, then I'm surprised, but he's probably doing something.
[05:53.85]If we're talking about the continuing careers of old wrestlers, though, I know that Kane is making a big splash in politics.
[06:00.36]If you guys haven't caught up with that.
[06:01.44]Yeah, he's trying to be the mayor of his hometown.
[06:04.14]He's trying to do a Jesse the Body Ventura.
[06:06.12]Yeah, but his branding is all based on his wrestler persona, though.
[06:09.90]It's all like, there'll be hell to pay when I'm mayor and shit like that.
[06:13.11]It's really funny.
[06:14.71]It's really great.
[06:15.81]Press conferences?
[06:17.35]Yeah.
[06:17.55]Before a press conference, the lights go down, and he just, like, does the fucking smash, and the fire goes up, and he gets to the podium.
[06:23.10]In the back, you hear, "'Buck on, it's Kane!
[06:25.44]He's running for mayor!
[06:26.50]Buck on!"
[06:27.12]"'Oh, my God, he's broken in half!'
[06:30.28]"'He's broken the Senate in half!'
[06:33.39]He's actually broken a podium in half.
[06:36.85]I think he's shit-faced.
[06:39.37]Based on preliminary polls, though, Kane is actually in the lead last I heard.
[06:43.27]Oh, really?
[06:43.63]That's awesome.
[06:45.39]Yeah, he's coming out on top right now.
[06:49.01]Fuck the whole thing up.
[06:49.85]You know what I mean?
[06:50.81]I hope Kane becomes president of the world.
[06:54.03]He'll have to fight Dwayne The Rock Johnson for that prestigious crown belt, excuse me.
[06:59.56]Didn't Donald Trump get his start in WWE?
[07:03.08]Yeah, they were gonna shave his head.
[07:04.56]It was either him or Vince McMahon were gonna have to shave their head if somebody lost a match or something.
[07:09.94]Yeah, and Vince lost.
[07:11.50]Yes, of course.
[07:12.41]Yeah, because Vince is just the fucking whipping boy.
[07:15.31]They didn't do it themselves.
[07:16.29]They each picked like a champion, but I forgot who they picked.
[07:19.81]Oh my lord.
[07:21.09]You said champion and it immediately reminded me of Rikishi.
[07:23.72]You guys remember his stink face move?
[07:25.81]Yep, of course.
[07:27.35]You remember when they tried to make him hip and edgy for the kids and he joined Scotty Too Hotty and who was the other one?
[07:34.56]And he did fucking like 90s hip hop dance moves.
[07:38.28]No, I don't remember that.
[07:38.98]I just remember one of the first things on pay-per-view that my parents ever paid for and let me watch was one of the WWE events.
[07:46.07]And I don't remember who it was.
[07:47.47]I think it was Stone Cold and Vince McMahon got into a feud.
[07:49.91]And then somebody ended up having to lick, or not lick, kiss Rikishi's asshole while he was stink-facing them.
[07:58.20]I was never the same boy.
[07:59.52]Is that spotting in their face?
[08:02.36]Yeah, so the stink face was, he would get them into one of the turnbuckles and he'd just start rubbing his ass cheeks on their face.
[08:11.65]Now, Jackson, what you don't realize, what you might not know off the top of your head, is Rikishi was like a 400-pound man.
[08:16.23]So this was a legitimate tactic.
[08:19.30]Cellulite.
[08:20.56]Cellulite everywhere.
[08:21.36]It was disgusting.
[08:22.78]it was a loaded cannon for sure so Jeremy you might remember when he joined uh who was the other guy it was scotty too hottie and some other like funky guys yeah yeah and they were like funky fresh 90s dance boy no no no no no no no no no they had like uh frosted tips yeah they they looked like they were straight out of a 90s boy band and they wore like Dr. seuss hats and baggy pants and and one of their special moves was he'd just get on the ground and start doing the worm and that was it
[08:51.96]It was so great.
[08:52.54]Like, oh, cool.
[08:53.54]You did the worm and then you did like an elbow drop.
[08:55.34]You could have just done the elbow drop.
[08:57.42]You don't need to do the fucking worm.
[08:58.86]Yeah, he had like a 20 minute long dance where he'd hop on one foot and the crowd would go apeshit and their opponent would just lay on the ground waiting for it to end.
[09:07.02]That's so good.
[09:07.58]Sounds like Ric Flair.
[09:09.12]That is so funny.
[09:09.60]The attitude error is so crazy because we went from can you pick up and scoop slam Andre the Giant to put your face in this fat guy's asshole.
[09:21.68]That was the challenge.
[09:25.03]That's why it was so good.
[09:26.13]They don't do that anymore.
[09:26.97]No man's asshole is putting another man's asshole's face.
[09:30.23]They don't escalate like they used to.
[09:31.73]Why did they stop?
[09:34.70]Well, probably because of, I don't know, changing taste.
[09:37.70]I guess people just lost their appetite for asshole and face, maybe?
[09:40.70]Yeah, they stopped doing Pornhub searches and they started doing, like, random first name, last name guy, like I said before.
[09:47.10]Yeah.
[09:47.66]I think a lot of it is, Jeremy, you can confirm, isn't it just because people also were getting hurt left and right?
[09:53.44]Like, from doing this shit and from copying it?
[09:56.30]Yeah, I mean, there was a lot of injuries that happened both on and off, right?
[10:00.90]Like, they banned the pile driver, right?
[10:03.20]Yeah, yeah.
[10:04.72]They banned the pile driver and hitting people in the head with chairs.
[10:09.61]The powerbomb, too, got really, really... I hate to use it.
[10:13.15]Nerfed?
[10:13.47]I hate to use that word.
[10:15.57]People have been hitting each other with chairs for far longer than wrestling exists.
[10:21.61]I know.
[10:22.09]That's the day wrestling died.
[10:23.73]The sad thing is that the WWE is now trying to, like, family sanitize all their old shit, too.
[10:28.77]If you go back and watch old classic matches, whenever someone's about to get hit in the head, they jump cut it so it doesn't happen.
[10:34.75]I saw that.
[10:35.51]It's fucking despicable.
[10:36.59]It's fucking terrible.
[10:37.65]I hate it.
[10:38.33]God.
[10:39.14]I went to Hell in a Cell when I was in Boston.
[10:41.49]Really?
[10:42.03]This is last year, yeah.
[10:43.27]Wow.
[10:43.49]And I remember, you think about it, right?
[10:44.65]Like, oh, hell in a cell.
[10:46.21]I want demons and fucking spooky ghosts.
[10:48.91]I mean, they want ghosts.
[10:51.24]You know what I mean, though.
[10:51.96]They were just like, you wanted crazy shit to happen.
[10:53.74]You wanted people to go through spikes.
[10:55.82]I mean, what am I, am I describing wrestling or what am I describing here?
[10:59.12]Warzone, I guess.
[10:59.96]Saw?
[11:01.36]Saw 3D?
[11:02.06]Yeah.
[11:04.04]By the way, did that movie suck, the new Saw?
[11:06.43]Yeah, it was pretty bad.
[11:08.36]Oh, a big time.
[11:09.02]It was pretty bad.
[11:09.92]They brought Saw back to life?
[11:12.55]No, it was it turns out spoiler alert for that turd by the way No at the end it turns out that everything was just a flashback.
[11:21.86]He's still dead Just like the first fucking movie He was still alive, but yeah, yeah, I mean the so so cancer jigsaw was still around in this movie It was still the one with you know, the super old jigsaw.
[11:36.98]Oh
[11:37.38]you were led to believe that he was not at all around technically it was just a flashback to cancer jigsaw still up and ticking yeah but it was a piece of regardless it was stupid speaking of like cutting the when they get hit in the head remember when isis started doing that and I hated it when I toned down the violence and all of a sudden they just skipped the beheadings and they just started right to the end hey watch this video I must
[12:04.80]I must have missed that arc in the WWE lore.
[12:08.87]I don't remember that one.
[12:10.83]I guess the YouTube adpocalypse hit ISIS pretty hard.
[12:14.88]Not the adpocalypse, no.
[12:16.64]Oh, come on.
[12:18.52]You guys did not have that morbid curiosity like a little schoolboy on a Christmas morning running...
[12:26.33]under the tree to check out life leak the newest drop from isis the newest video to see who they beheaded this week and then all of a sudden one day they stopped showing the actual beheading and they did did you write a complaint
[12:42.37]I can't see shit like that.
[12:43.29]Let me tell you, man.
[12:43.87]Like, if any time I ever watched any of those, like, fucked up videos back in the day, it just makes you feel bad for the rest of the year.
[12:51.80]Like, every day after that is like, oh, this sucks.
[12:54.76]They did it for you, then.
[12:55.80]It's PG now.
[12:57.28]Kinda.
[12:58.26]It's family friendly.
[12:58.78]I hope you're a happy gem.
[12:59.86]No, I'm not happy.
[13:00.90]I'm not happy about YouTube.
[13:01.98]YouTube sucks now.
[13:03.18]Wait, hold on.
[13:04.46]You guys, this is going on YouTube, right?
[13:06.38]Yeah.
[13:07.04]Don't worry.
[13:07.56]We've said plenty about YouTube.
[13:08.94]Okay, yeah.
[13:09.88]YouTube sucks asshole now.
[13:11.72]Speaking of that, you know who I'd love to have put in Rikishi's asshole?
[13:14.40]All of YouTube.
[13:15.94]Can we do like a YouTube versus Hulk Hogan where Hulk Hogan leg drops him and then they have to put their asshole in YouTube's face?
[13:21.86]So what you're saying is the next YouTube Rewind is going to be 30 uninterrupted minutes of Rikishi's asshole.
[13:27.06]I hope so.
[13:28.00]That's all we need.
[13:29.08]I'd come back.
[13:32.10]You've won me over with this.
[13:33.72]But anyways, my train of thought went completely off rail there.
[13:37.08]But I went to Hell in a Cell in Boston.
[13:39.64]And somebody mentioned that they toned it down a lot.
[13:44.83]And it was to a point where there's like a character now that comes up and gives people hugs.
[13:51.05]It's like, Hell in a Cell, fucking blood, metal, right?
[13:55.07]I mean, they don't really play metal, but, like, you're giving people hugs and throwing candy to the audience and shit, like, what happened?
[14:02.96]What the fuck?
[14:03.96]It's Halloween.
[14:05.42]And there was no, there was a lot of screw-ups, like, people were trying to get thrown through tables, and the tables, the collapsible, broken-in-the-middle-already tables weren't breaking.
[14:16.08]So there was embarrassing like, oh, I throw you on the table.
[14:19.00]It didn't break.
[14:19.92]Oh, shit.
[14:20.36]Let's try that again.
[14:21.14]It didn't break again.
[14:22.00]Let's hug instead.
[14:22.66]Oh, let's just hug.
[14:25.32]One of my friends fell asleep.
[14:26.58]One of my friends was shit-faced.
[14:28.68]And we went there as like a group of I think like 12 people, I think.
[14:33.16]We were all wearing baby cane masks.
[14:35.44]If you don't know what a baby cane mask is, it's really simply...
[14:39.49]It's a mask that is too small for your face.
[14:42.81]You know like those little human face masks?
[14:44.77]They're white.
[14:47.53]You paint it as a cane and you make it so it barely fits on your face and you turn it into baby cane.
[14:51.43]It's perfect.
[14:52.43]So we're all in baby cane masks because he was asleep the entire time.
[14:55.90]From the Jabra matches in the very beginning to the very end because it was so awful.
[15:00.79]They didn't put enough hugs throughout their hug breaks.
[15:05.07]Apparently not, but that's... People liked wrestling because it wasn't real.
[15:10.41]It wasn't supposed to be taken seriously.
[15:12.99]It was superheroes.
[15:13.79]It was cartoon characters fighting each other.
[15:16.54]It wasn't supposed to be a sports simulation, which is what they want it to be now, apparently.
[15:20.72]I don't know why.
[15:22.46]They just lost what made it fun, I think is the big thing.
[15:25.94]Mhm.
[15:27.09]Yeah.
[15:27.83]They're trying to push too hard to family-friendly without realizing that the kids are gonna watch the unfamily-friendly shit anyway.
[15:34.07]So you just lose the adults.
[15:35.65]So is it ads?
[15:36.09]Is the reason ads?
[15:37.41]Like sponsors and stuff?
[15:38.51]That if you're shoving someone's face in an anus, it loses like your Gillette sponsorship or something like that?
[15:44.57]Is that what's happening?
[15:45.33]Well, I would love to have my face shoved into someone's ass if they were wearing Beta brand dress pant yoga pants.

[16:50.49]Are you enjoying streaming far more than you've ever enjoyed YouTube?
[16:54.53]Um, I think there's two answers there.
[16:57.26]Probably yes and no.
[16:59.47]Because I think with live broadcasting is, you know, it's a double story.
[17:06.98]Switching to live, I came from the whole YouTube crowd where heavy editing.
[17:12.86]Editing everything.
[17:13.66]I want the perfect joke.
[17:14.78]I want the perfect placement.
[17:16.08]I want that sound to be right there.
[17:17.70]Is that sound not in the right place?
[17:19.16]No, fucking delete it.
[17:21.19]You can't do that live.
[17:23.13]And a lot of people will come to a stream and be like, oh, alright, I'm going to watch Jerma stream.
[17:28.07]Alright, hold on, this is gonna be like six hours?
[17:31.05]Alright, um, when's like the cool shit gonna happen?
[17:35.08]The transitioning an audience that has been watching, you know, five or six minute highlight videos to, hey, now sit here for six hours and maybe something fucking cool will happen, can be difficult, you know?
[17:47.00]It's a different type of demand on their attention span, which I guess translates into a different kind of audience.
[17:53.51]Yeah, it does.
[17:55.57]But also, what I've been trying to do lately is, instead of just pure video game streams, try to do other stuff that is maybe not on the platform.
[18:07.42]I recently did a polygraph on stream.
[18:10.56]I got a guy to come and give me a polygraph.
[18:13.23]To prove, of course, that I'm the most transparent person on the internet.
[18:18.69]We had a lot of questions.
[18:19.81]The number one question that was asked was, do you eat ass?
[18:23.30]And obviously, that was a no.
[18:25.42]I don't.
[18:26.00]And that was true.
[18:27.33]Wait.
[18:28.23]Well, that just makes it look bad.
[18:29.35]Oh, so it's confirmed.
[18:30.47]No.
[18:30.63]Why don't you eat us?
[18:31.51]It was confirmed not true.
[18:34.21]What do you got?
[18:34.89]Am I in a room?
[18:35.51]You're confusing the fuck out of me right now.
[18:37.15]Am I in a room full of ass eaters?
[18:38.12]Tell me.
[18:38.58]Do you eat us?
[18:39.52]No.
[18:40.62]What do you mean room full of ass eaters?
[18:43.36]I don't know.
[18:44.38]You seem to be pretty upset by that one.
[18:45.64]Am I in a room full of asses?
[18:47.22]Do you know how upset Rakeshi would be if he could hear you right now?
[18:51.29]Do you know how upset Kai is?
[18:52.61]He was just talking about huffable asses.
[18:56.17]Obviously he's going to be an ass eater.
[18:58.57]I know, right?
[19:00.47]Dude, it's a special treat.
[19:01.55]I don't know what your problem is.
[19:03.73]Transitioning to live, but also not so live.
[19:10.31]Maybe some scripted stuff and maybe some audience interacting stuff.
[19:15.79]It's hard to try to find the medium.
[19:18.00]But I would say, at least for company-wise, the reason why I kind of moved away from YouTube was they started just running the site into the ground and they started to employ these weird policies where all of a sudden now you might not be able to say a bad word on your videos.
[19:36.22]No, we're going to copyright claim everything.
[19:38.24]You're going to get content ID claimed because who fucking cares?
[19:41.37]Somebody will figure it out.
[19:42.25]I just didn't like the direction that they were going, so I decided to... Do you think Twitch is going in that direction now?
[19:48.17]I've noticed they've made a few, like, fast-flowing decisions.
[19:51.13]Yeah, Twitch is... Yeah, it's just they have a terms of service that they don't really enforce 100%.
[19:59.04]So they kind of have, like, oh, we have this terms of service.
[20:01.22]Please follow it.
[20:02.20]Did you break those rules?
[20:04.13]Who are you?
[20:05.39]Okay, well, then maybe you'll get this punishment.
[20:07.70]Maybe you'll get that punishment.
[20:08.74]I think that across the board, these platforms... There's a lot of favoritism.
[20:14.32]I would agree with that.
[20:16.54]But it's like that on YouTube as well.
[20:17.90]There's all kinds of...
[20:22.24]I would say gray areas that these terms of services don't, they need to be completely and totally absolute.
[20:32.50]You can't have wiggle room with the terms of service.
[20:35.10]And that's why I wanted to move away from YouTube.
[20:36.84]And don't get me wrong, Twitch is unbelievable.
[20:39.96]They do so much to try to help out their partners and their affiliates.
[20:44.05]They try way more than Google does in the sense of trying to make their partners and creators happy.
[20:52.03]So with that regard, I would say they're miles ahead.
[20:55.33]Are you being paid by them?
[20:57.26]By Twitch?
[20:58.54]Yes.
[20:59.54]I mean, well, I get paid through subscriptions from the Twitch.
[21:02.34]So no, technically.
[21:04.33]I've just never heard anybody speak so favorably of them.
[21:07.75]Well, I actually, I've echoed that same thing.
[21:09.93]The main problem I have personally with Twitch is the selective enforcement of their rules.
[21:13.96]Like, there is pretty blatant favoritism, especially when it's a very good-looking, big-titted female.
[21:21.26]And it's hard to deny that.
[21:23.08]But like Jermis said, this isn't just a Twitch problem, it's more of an internet, social media site problem.
[21:27.60]Yeah, I think it's more, because look at Twitter, it's the same thing.
[21:30.08]Like, you know, some people... Yeah, exactly.
[21:31.74]It's not just a Twitch, a YouTube, a... Well, yeah.
[21:35.67]Bungle, what's Bungle?
[21:37.81]I'm going to look that up right now.
[21:39.31]Yeah, what is Bungle, Jeremy?
[21:40.93]Did I make that up?
[21:41.59]Did I make up a website?
[21:43.65]It's a site for ass-eaters.
[21:44.95]How do you know that?
[21:45.88]It's Rikishi's ass-eating website.
[21:48.42]I made that up.
[21:49.16]That's not a real site.
[21:49.86]Just forget I said Bungle.
[21:50.92]Okay, Bungle's apparently like a creepy fucking bear from like a children's television show.
[21:56.10]So that guy, yeah, he has favoritism.
[21:58.36]Yeah, that guy's got favoritism on Twitch.
[22:00.81]He can like stream himself naked.
[22:02.23]Look at him.
[22:03.57]Wow, that is creepy.
[22:05.03]Hassan probably jerks off to him.
[22:09.22]That meme will never get old.
[22:10.40]I don't think it's necessarily a certain website problem.
[22:14.48]I think it's just kind of a internet culture problem.
[22:18.02]Yeah, yeah.
[22:19.56]Where there's not clear rules for anything.
[22:22.19]And I guess that's kind of by design, but at the same time, it can hurt a lot of people.
[22:28.72]It just makes it intimidating because you never know what's going to happen to, let's say, if you're not in that bracket of Twitch's favorite, you don't know what kind of punishment you're going to get if you break the same rule that somebody else did.
[22:39.71]You might get permanently banned.
[22:41.03]They might not even get banned.
[22:42.83]So it just kind of creates a witch hunting atmosphere.
[22:46.04]Like, why are you guys doing this?
[22:47.46]What's going on over there?
[22:49.42]And a lot of it can be... And now look, I'm coming at you here as a Twitch partner.
[22:55.14]You know what I mean?
[22:56.38]But a lot of it can be...
[22:58.79]I don't know, maybe growing pains from Amazon.
[23:00.61]They did just get bought like a couple of years ago.
[23:02.81]That deal wasn't even, what, three or four years old?
[23:05.69]You know, it's funny, though.
[23:07.01]You mentioned that.
[23:07.56]I think Amazon, once they bought it, only brought in good changes for the most part.
[23:11.56]No, no.
[23:12.36]That's what I'm saying.
[23:14.26]Twitch in general is, you know, the whole Twitch Prime thing was a huge fucking deal.
[23:19.10]That's a massive deal.
[23:20.66]That's a big one, yeah.
[23:23.08]That's what I mean when I'm talking about things that they're doing right.
[23:25.07]They're doing a lot of things right.
[23:27.70]The whole Amazon acquisition has done nothing, but at least in an obvious monetary sense, it's been wildly different than what it was a couple of years ago before they added the Amazon Prime.
[23:43.66]Oh yeah, big time.
[23:45.60]So Jerma, you're pretty transitioning hard to Twitch this whole discussion.
[23:50.00]What was really beneficial to you to kind of migrate your audience over?
[23:53.61]Because you, I'm assuming, were really concentrated on YouTube, but now you also seem to get a lot of viewers on Twitch and a big chunk of that audience watching.
[24:02.33]What helped you get to moving over there?
[24:04.83]Yeah, what was your strategy?
[24:08.09]I think the strategy was kind of just not to have one.
[24:11.33]Because I think, honestly, people don't want to be told what to do.
[24:16.71]You know what I mean?
[24:17.51]If you tell somebody, hey, by the way, I'm moving over to Twitch.
[24:20.39]You better fucking go there.
[24:21.27]You better go there right now.
[24:22.69]The clock's ticking.
[24:24.44]I ain't doing anything ever again on YouTube.
[24:26.14]Go fuck yourself.
[24:28.30]I think that just simply by saying, hey, this is... Because I never really... This is kind of embarrassing for me to admit.
[24:35.48]But I never really...
[24:38.74]wanted to abandon my Voldemort channel.
[24:42.86]I say Voldemort channel as in, I mean, I'm not a Harry Potter fan club, as in the channel that cannot be named.
[24:49.19]It's the main channel.
[24:49.83]I named it.
[24:50.25]Hopefully I don't die by my Voldemort channel.
[24:52.45]I never wanted to... The intention was never to abandon that channel.
[24:55.45]The intention was I wanted to bring...
[24:59.24]better quality production and better quality stuff to that platform.
[25:03.72]And it was becoming increasingly difficult to do that with, you know, there was at the end of the day, right?
[25:11.46]Like if you're going to spend a month or two on a video full time and YouTube's like, oh, by the way, we may have cut all ad revenue by like 48%.
[25:20.76]It's just like, whoa, I can't really do that full time anymore.
[25:25.41]You know, it's not possible.
[25:28.17]So then you throw around the idea of like Patreon, what about should I transition to Twitch and try to do like some more live stuff?
[25:34.09]I think it was more a natural, hey, this is kind of what I feel like doing and I also want to do bigger projects as well.
[25:41.15]And I mean, I've done a few, I would say bigger projects that aren't just Twitch game streaming.
[25:48.24]I mean, having actors come in and do random things and try to make more production stuff.
[25:53.94]There's plans.
[25:55.22]I mean, I'm moving across the country.
[25:57.42]to try to make some of this stuff a reality.
[26:00.04]Are you going to California?
[26:01.93]Because trying to convince somebody to give me a polygraph test in Boston is like impossible.
[26:07.09]But going to like Los Angeles or Las Vegas is much easier to come across that kind of thing.
[26:13.31]Because all the scam artists are out there.
[26:15.97]Yeah, not admissible in court, by the way.
[26:18.23]But it was more natural than it was, I think, not forcing people to make a decision.
[26:23.80]and telling them that this is my plan and being real not trying to cut corners and say well hey there'll be a video next week bros it it must have been like nerve-wracking for you though when you made that transition because if you completely cut off your youtube channel there would have been that kind of middle area where you weren't making any revenue right yeah but at the end of the day I don't give a fuck about like making money I never did and it's
[26:51.78]If I lose, you know, a bunch of money a month because I did something that made me happier, that's what I'm going to do.
[26:59.73]I think a lot of, we're in this weird kind of, I hate to say, internet points culture where everyone kind of feels like they have to, like people are attributing happiness with like view counts and retweets and shit.
[27:16.14]And I think that that's going down a weird path because a lot of people, especially the younger generation, all these fucking kids, they're seeing like, oh, this guy's a streamer and he's got a fucking bunch of viewers and that's what I'm going to do.
[27:32.26]And you just got to be careful because happiness at the end of the day is very, very, it doesn't, what makes me happy doesn't make you happy, right?
[27:42.53]Could be completely different.
[27:44.51]So just trying to find that middle ground where we're not kind of telling people, hey, you have to do this, you have to do that, you have to come watch my fucking Twitch stream.
[27:53.29]I need a bunch of money.
[27:54.69]Don't you know?
[27:55.09]Like, go get paid more than a doctor for playing Minecraft.
[27:59.48]I think that that's kind of, we need to be, like, careful there.
[28:03.62]And money seems to be a lot of the drive.
[28:06.50]That's kind of the point I'm getting at.
[28:07.94]For a lot of people that start internet stuff, they do it in the pursuit of that clout, as the children like to refer to it as.
[28:15.90]What I'd like to know, though, Jerma, when you did the real-life wrestling showdown in WrestleMania, the real-life Jerma Rumble, if you were to do that again, where would that go?
[28:24.57]Because that seems like some content that couldn't exist on Twitch unless you really somehow pulled out all the stops.
[28:30.37]It would be live.
[28:31.51]You know, for some reason, that didn't even... Well, that was an easy solution.
[28:35.41]But it's not, though.
[28:36.49]You know what I mean?
[28:37.16]Like, that video was like a two-day shoot.
[28:44.16]And it wasn't as simple as, hey, just turn it on.
[28:46.14]Who fucking cares?
[28:46.94]It would be a lot more moving parts.
[28:50.32]So I would want to do it live.
[28:51.62]Something that realistically could be done, though.
[28:53.86]Yeah.
[28:54.38]For some reason to me, it made it seem impossible.
[28:56.95]I was like, there's no one could ever do this.
[28:59.51]But video on demand content doesn't have to disappear.
[29:01.79]You know, it's just like I said before, when we first started having this conversation, me doing what makes me happy is what I'm going to do.
[29:10.60]And I'm not going to force myself.
[29:13.52]to, you know, jump into Gary's mod every day.
[29:16.78]I'm not going to do that.
[29:17.42]I think a lot of people that do do that for the monetary gain do get burnt out pretty quickly as well.
[29:21.89]It doesn't sound like you've... I stream three days a week.
[29:24.57]I only stream three days a week.
[29:26.03]You know, I don't want to get to that stage because once you get to that stage, you get fucking miserable.
[29:31.74]You become like an insufferable fucking person if you do the same goddamn thing every day and you start to hate what you're doing.
[29:38.26]I never want to get there.
[29:39.36]I've told my audience a thousand times, if I'm not liking what I'm doing, I ain't going to do it anymore.
[29:45.73]So that's why transitioning, I guess to wrap the whole thing from that conversation earlier, transitioning to Twitch was part of that.
[29:53.95]You know, I like this, I want to do this, and if I don't do this, then I might not be doing this anymore.
[29:59.81]I think you've definitely got the right mindset in approaching the things.
[30:04.38]How sad would you guys really be if YouTube went down forever?
[30:09.68]Are there actually any videos you guys would give a fuck about on that level?
[30:13.49]Are you talking about, like, on a level of, like, uh... In general.
[30:16.87]Just, I don't know, some random Skynet apocalypse text on YouTube.
[30:20.57]It's lost forever, it's not coming back.
[30:22.56]Is there anything you would actually be sad about?
[30:24.60]Besides your own channels, I mean.
[30:27.02]Oh, yeah.
[30:27.66]Tell his whole life would go down the drain.
[30:29.90]I wouldn't have a creative outlet.
[30:32.08]I'd never be able to watch the Iowa hog-calling competition ever again.
[30:35.66]It's the best video on the whole site, so.
[30:37.91]I mean, that would be terrible.
[30:38.99]I would hold a funeral for that video.
[30:40.59]I guess if you're talking about it from an outside perspective, Kaya, I do feel like a lot of people would miss a lot of things because there isn't another, like, backed-up platform.
[30:49.49]Archive.org is, it's ass.
[30:51.59]It backs up, like, five videos a year, it feels like.
[30:54.54]There's really just nowhere else you can watch those things, so when they're gone off YouTube, they're fucking gone.
[30:58.76]And that's a big point.
[30:59.26]That's how I feel now.
[31:00.42]Yeah.
[31:00.96]I mean, recently I've been... You know me, Charlie.
[31:03.60]I love watching these obscure lunatics on YouTube.
[31:06.90]And now I've just... Every time I come across a channel, I immediately download all of their videos because I know they're going to be gone tomorrow.
[31:14.64]And I'm always... Do you have like a server up and running?
[31:17.36]You should share some of your treasure finds with us.
[31:20.84]Hold on, wait, wait.
[31:21.48]There are people that you watch that all their videos get deleted a day after they get uploaded?
[31:27.29]How do they keep uploading videos?
[31:29.43]I think we all need to relax.
[31:31.34]I think we're getting too heated over this.
[31:32.74]This is getting too much.
[31:33.82]Like, we should maybe take a nap on a bed featuring Brooklinen sheets.
[31:38.64]My Brooklinen sheets are the best.
[31:40.74]They're the most comfortable sheets I've ever slept on.
[31:42.64]That's it.
[31:43.30]Hands down, they're the greatest.
[31:45.90]Brooklinen sheets come in a versatile array of colors and patterns.
[31:51.17]You can mix and match them.
[31:53.15]I can't speak to compliment any decor.
[31:55.93]Brooklinen sheets were named the winner of the... Jerma, what category do you think they won in good housekeeping?
[32:05.32]Cleanest.
[32:05.98]Best of online betting.
[32:07.26]That's right, Jerma.
[32:08.94]There's no unnecessary markups, no fees.
[32:12.20]Most betting is marked up as much as 300% when you're not shopping Brooklinen.
[32:17.03]That is disgusting.
[32:18.87]Tell them about it, Jackson.
[32:22.04]Tell them why it's disgusting.
[32:23.25]Tell them how to get... No, tell them how to get Brooklinen.
[32:27.15]You can get Brooklinen by going to brooklinen.com.

[32:51.50]I like Brooklinen.
[32:52.89]Jeremiah, let's bring up some even realer shit.
[32:55.58]I'm being told by some of the finest reporters in the business that you too are a man who struggles with height.
[33:00.68]Is that true?
[33:02.70]Yeah.
[33:05.41]Alright, next question.
[33:06.73]Let's go.
[33:07.47]Anything else?
[33:08.97]Yeah, I hate it.
[33:10.03]Where are you on the small, average small, average small, come on.
[33:17.16]I'm right smack dab in that average US female height.
[33:20.34]I'm at 5'6".
[33:23.22]I'm 5'7 and like a quarter.
[33:26.79]I'm like just under 5'8".
[33:29.79]I like to say 5'8 with shoes and that's like bullshit.
[33:32.79]But you know what?
[33:33.41]It's not.
[33:35.30]God, we need to start getting middle schoolers on here or something so I'm finally taller than somebody.
[33:39.02]Jesus Christ.
[33:39.48]You must be tiny.
[33:39.82]But that's not even that small.
[33:41.36]Like, alright, let me tell you something.
[33:43.68]Like, 5'6", 5'7", 5'8".
[33:44.62]I mean, it's smaller.
[33:48.25]But we're not talking about, like, Smurfs.
[33:50.61]Like, I get a lot of shit for that.
[33:53.01]Sounds like you're trying to convince yourself.
[33:54.99]Oh, I am.
[33:55.63]Absolutely.
[33:57.51]Don't worry.
[33:57.93]I do the same thing every day too, Jerma.
[33:59.71]Don't worry.
[34:00.07]I'm in the mirror all the time.
[34:01.63]I'm not grotesque.
[34:02.91]I'm not freakishly small.
[34:04.15]Vladimir Putin is 5'7".
[34:07.69]Zac Efron is 5'7".
[34:11.40]As a smaller person, we all memorize all the Hollywood actors that are smaller than us.
[34:15.82]Daniel Radcliffe is 5'5".
[34:19.02]I don't know how Putin fit in there.
[34:20.80]I memorize all the dictators that are smaller than me.
[34:24.24]How big is Kim Jong-un?
[34:26.36]According to their folklore, he's like eight feet tall.
[34:29.20]How tall do you think the guy that plays Jon Snow is on Game of Thrones?
[34:31.83]Please be 5'5".
[34:32.79]He is 5'6".
[34:34.43]Oh, baby!
[34:35.61]They make him look like he's 6'4 on that show.
[34:38.55]Yeah, they do.
[34:39.61]They'd be even hotter, though, if they were tall.
[34:42.55]Oh, Tom Cruise is notoriously small.
[34:46.03]I just remembered that.
[34:47.36]To the point where he purposely films in his films, he uses certain angles to look taller.
[34:53.70]You guys know Seth Green is 5'3"?
[34:56.04]What?
[34:56.69]Yes.
[34:57.51]No.
[34:58.11]Seth Green is 5'3".
[34:59.33]Memorize every Hollywood actor that's shorter than you, don't you understand?
[35:02.15]Uh, Tyrion Lannister.
[35:04.85]Peter Dinklage?
[35:05.41]Yeah, that one.
[35:08.35]I don't like using the Peter Dinklage angle there, because... You only use it when it's convenient for you, hey?
[35:15.75]No, you pick up the people that are smaller than you, but aren't classified as, you know, tiny, right?
[35:22.64]Midgets?
[35:23.40]Oh.
[35:24.12]Yeah, dwarves.
[35:25.74]People are going to watch this and they're going to go, I'm going to get so much shit for this.
[35:30.66]We talk about being short all the time.
[35:32.36]Kevin Hart, the ones that I can always string off are Kevin Hart, Zac Efron, obviously.
[35:37.23]Tom Cruise and Daniel Radcliffe are my four go-tos because you don't expect that.
[35:40.81]Well, Kevin Hart.
[35:41.43]No, I was about to say everyone knows Kevin Hart's tiny.
[35:44.53]Add Kit Harington to your list because Jon Snow is 5'6".
[35:47.61]I didn't know that, so that's definitely going on my list.
[35:49.37]Tom or Tom, whatever it is, York, the lead of Radiohead is 5'6".
[35:53.23]Oh, no one remembers Tom York now.
[35:54.97]Yeah, why would you say that?
[35:56.23]Why does Joseph Stalin have his own IMDB page?
[36:00.06]Does he?
[36:00.90]Hold on, what?
[36:02.22]He started his own propaganda, I guess it counts.
[36:04.46]What the fuck?
[36:05.18]Why would he have an IMDB page?
[36:06.74]Why has he acted in Man of Steel?
[36:10.01]Must be different.
[36:11.79]Well, yeah, it must be so different.
[36:13.31]IMDB's bullshit.
[36:14.63]I went to high school with a kid that told everybody that he was in a bunch of movies and we all believed him because he had an IMDB page.
[36:20.17]But he lied.
[36:21.83]He wasn't in any of these movies.
[36:23.89]And then he moved to a different state before we could confront him about it.
[36:26.97]That motherfucker.
[36:29.25]He came home from school.
[36:30.95]He went, Mom, they're on to me.
[36:32.83]We gotta get out of here.
[36:34.01]He knew he was moving.
[36:35.13]So he's like, fuck it.
[36:35.79]I'm gonna fuck with all these people.
[36:37.31]And we all thought he was some famous Hollywood actor.
[36:40.55]So you're telling me... Imagine how many fucking blowjobs he got.
[36:43.25]You're telling me you got pulled into the actual Max Keeble's big move story?
[36:47.26]Yeah.
[36:47.64]Oh, yeah.
[36:48.61]Oh, God.
[36:49.95]I'm sorry to hear that.
[36:50.87]That's a travesty that doesn't befall many men.
[36:53.36]It was so cool.
[36:54.28]It was like, holy shit, man, this guy made it.
[36:56.58]And then he moved.
[36:57.92]And then we found out the movies came out that he said he was in, and he wasn't in them.
[37:01.66]At all.
[37:02.78]Maybe he moved to Hollywood to be in those movies.
[37:05.27]Charlie did the same thing to us.
[37:07.11]He was all like, I'm gonna be a mockingbird, look out for me and shit.
[37:11.67]Charlie said, and I quote, the day it happened, guys, look for me, I'm the main fucking character in the new Hunger Games.
[37:17.84]It's insane, they're going with a man now, fuck Katniss.
[37:21.08]Watch, watch, I'll be on every poster, every trailer, I'm gonna be on Conan O'Brien talking about the movie, and then you know what happened, Jerma?
[37:27.21]Charlie, tell Jerma what happened.
[37:28.67]I saw the video.
[37:30.95]Oh, he's caught up then.
[37:32.15]Oh, I caught up.
[37:33.21]Yeah, you were the guy waving your hand, right?
[37:36.72]Yeah, I'm still in there, but not in the same glory that I once was.
[37:39.82]Trying so desperately to get on camera.
[37:42.01]They had to cut him.
[37:42.77]It was a whole Me Too thing.
[37:44.19]Charlie was found out to be molesting gay children.
[37:47.40]It was a whole big spiel.
[37:49.66]Oh, damn.
[37:50.20]I actually was extremely excited about that, though, in all honesty.
[37:54.01]I told Kaya, like, the day of that I found out, and then Andrew not long after, and then... Oh, yeah.
[37:59.81]Didn't you skip school and have your mom drive you to the audition?
[38:03.19]How long ago was that?
[38:04.95]It was four years ago, because I would have been a sophomore in college.
[38:08.64]So you're just telling the story now?
[38:10.00]Well, it never seemed appropriate.
[38:13.58]I mentioned it on an earlier podcast with an actual famous actor, and people kept asking about it.
[38:19.80]But, Kaya, you're close.
[38:21.28]I skipped two weeks of school.
[38:23.65]I got kicked out of a class because of it, and my dad drove me.
[38:29.15]Jesus Christ.
[38:29.99]Did you drive there every day or did you stay in an hotel?
[38:32.71]What did you do?
[38:34.09]Wow, I didn't know it was two weeks.
[38:37.05]Did you enjoy like a 16-hour day for like $40?
[38:39.59]Oh my god, I wish it was $40.
[38:42.48]If I saw more than three pennies, it would have been a miracle.
[38:45.10]You didn't get paid?
[38:46.78]No.
[38:47.32]Well, I mean, kind of.
[38:49.04]I just kind of consider it money that went right into the gas tank because it didn't even cover the gas cost.
[38:55.04]Did they at least like give you amenities?
[38:56.40]Like did they feed you?
[38:57.88]yeah no I think it was overall I'd say it was a cool experience I did two shoots the but I don't have any cool stories from the second one the other one was we just stood out in like freezing cold weather and they dumped water on us for the opening scene of the movie there's really nothing fun about that at all that sounds like they're torturing people yeah there was a risk of hypothermia because they used a lot of old actors and actresses so they just told them to wait in the tent and they had the younger people double up on their on their spots
[39:25.63]Ooh.
[39:26.79]Then Quentin Tarantino came in and choked you and spat on you.
[39:31.09]That's the crazy thing about acting and about, you know, being in movies and being extras.
[39:36.17]Oh my god, you don't, like, have any rights.
[39:38.71]No, not at all.
[39:39.39]They get you on that set and they're like, okay, I want you to stand there and you're gonna get, like, shot by fucking paintballs for the next six hours.
[39:45.31]And then after we do that, we'll be warmed up and start shooting.
[39:50.01]then Adam Sandler's going to come out and go like, and you're going to laugh.
[39:53.04]Oh, Jerma, you just reminded me of my favorite on-set brutality story I found out about recently.
[39:58.38]I'm sure you guys know the movie Billy Madison, yeah?
[40:01.76]Everyone knows him?
[40:02.44]Oh, yeah.
[40:03.14]Love it.
[40:03.54]Classic.
[40:04.02]So the fucking scene, I found this out recently, where Billy Madison is playing dodgeball with the little kids, apparently that's 100% real.
[40:12.49]Adam Sandler was made up kid.
[40:13.81]Yeah, he would just peg little kids in the face with dodgeballs Start crying and shit when the cameras are like such a fun job Adam Sandler has the dream job He just throws dodgeballs at kids and goes on vacations.
[40:26.75]Can't believe the parents were okay with this.
[40:28.61]Yeah, hit my son.
[40:29.51]He's a little shit.
[40:31.19]I Jump on like the Adam Sandler to hate bandwagon, but like but really though
[40:36.52]He's getting people to pay him to make movies.
[40:39.64]And, like, the movies he makes are not even remotely good.
[40:43.98]Wasn't there an interview where he said that he doesn't give a shit about the movies?
[40:47.76]He just likes to go on vacations with his friends?
[40:49.58]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:50.26]He goes on vacations with his group of friends.
[40:51.96]That's why they're all the same actors in the movies.
[40:54.67]It's like a tax break or something.
[40:56.51]Also, the movies aren't good, but they make a dickload of money, though.
[41:00.23]Do they?
[41:01.07]They're not good, but, oh, yeah, they make a ton of money.
[41:02.97]They're always a commercial success.
[41:05.27]How?
[41:07.02]Who's seeing these movies?
[41:09.69]I used to be a huge Adam Sandler fan, and I'm not going to see the pixels.
[41:14.19]Well, it's because they've always got big publishers behind them, so there's a lot of marketing and stuff.
[41:18.73]And people, like the general audience, just don't care, really.
[41:21.42]I mean, Adam Sandler movies are very safe at the end of the day, even though, if you think about it, they're terrible at the end of the day.
[41:27.40]It hits all the right quotas to get in a big audience.
[41:30.30]I can't believe he's 71.
[41:32.36]What?
[41:32.62]What?
[41:33.48]What?
[41:33.98]What?
[41:35.34]No, he's not.
[41:36.14]Oh, okay.
[41:38.06]Jesus Christ.
[41:39.98]Yeah, okay, Mr. 32.
[41:40.70]You know, Hollywood actors, you gotta make them older, too, when you're old.
[41:42.98]I thought he was like 60 in Billy Madison or something.
[41:48.48]He's like 45 in that movie.
[41:50.34]Stop doing movies because his hip gave out.
[41:53.97]Oh, God.
[41:54.79]Speaking of hips giving out and really old actors, Dollar Shave Club will help you looking youthful.

[43:21.75]How do you not shave?
[43:22.41]You don't even do like your neck or your eyebrows or anything?
[43:24.85]Oh, well, no.
[43:26.37]When he says shave, I assume he meant shave it all off.
[43:29.85]Oh, hang on.
[43:30.61]We're talking to the bone.
[43:32.95]Hang on.
[43:33.63]Let Andrew the metrosexual talk for a moment.
[43:35.96]You shave your eyebrows?
[43:37.86]Not my eyebrows.
[43:38.50]No, I don't shave them off.
[43:40.62]I don't shave them off.
[43:41.44]I trim the hair around them so they look nicer.
[43:44.02]I don't get rid of them.
[43:45.26]You gotta pluck, man.
[43:46.04]You gotta pluck the middle.
[43:46.78]Yeah, exactly.
[43:47.72]Yeah, you don't want a unibrow.
[43:48.78]You don't want to be a fucking caveman at the grocery store.
[43:51.78]You want to pluck them.
[43:53.18]Yeah.
[43:54.52]Hell, sometimes if I'm lazy, I'll just run a razor blade through there once and that works too.
[44:01.20]My current girlfriend, this is a quick little story about eyebrow shaving.
[44:06.95]She's really into makeup and design and stuff.
[44:10.01]And when we first started seeing each other, she's really into makeup and stuff.
[44:12.77]And I used to shave my middle of my brow.
[44:17.04]And when we first started seeing each other, she's like, oh, hey, just by the way, you look ridiculous because you're shaving way too much of your eyebrow.
[44:23.60]I guess I was shaving like a half inch to the right.
[44:26.06]I looked ridiculous, apparently.
[44:29.46]Shaving the middle of my eyebrow too far to the right.
[44:32.05]I was deleting half my eyebrow, apparently.
[44:34.39]Imagine how long you had been doing that for.
[44:36.41]Imagine all those times that someone saw and didn't correct you or anything.
[44:40.53]Absolute decades.
[44:41.51]Imagine how many job interviews you were turned down, how many friends you didn't make all because of those eyebrows.
[44:46.55]You know what?
[44:46.91]And I can think, I can count on one hand the amount of times that I've talked to people and they looked at me and they're just like, fuck this guy.
[44:53.01]It's been at least like three or four times.
[44:54.29]Now I know.
[44:55.97]Maybe that's why you look like Quasimodo, because you're all like some... Yeah, really.
[45:01.05]Why do I look like Quasimodo?
[45:02.30]I can't figure it out.
[45:04.10]I got a big brow bone, too.
[45:06.23]Like, it's not good.
[45:07.11]I got, like, a large brow bone.
[45:10.61]So you're a Cro-Magnon man, you would say?
[45:12.81]Yeah, I got, like, a fucking banana chin.
[45:14.29]Like, me with a shaved face.
[45:15.63]You don't want to see me.
[45:16.19]Wait, wait, wait.
[45:16.61]Banana chin?
[45:17.45]I got a banana chin.
[45:18.41]I got a big brow.
[45:19.43]What the fuck is that?
[45:21.51]It's a chin that looks like a banana.
[45:24.36]It's a Chad chin actually, Andrew.
[45:26.97]Jesus, yeah, you're a total Chad.
[45:28.73]I just looked you up.
[45:30.03]Now I get it.
[45:30.67]Oh, shut the fuck up and get out of here.
[45:32.27]Wait, what?
[45:33.55]That was just flexing on us.
[45:34.73]Oh, I have a chiseled jawline.
[45:36.05]Okay, the first image was...
[45:39.45]Yeah, you look like Flash.
[45:42.73]Type in Jerma in the Google images and look at that first image.
[45:45.81]I'm like a fucking murderer.
[45:47.51]Shut up, man.
[45:48.01]I just did.
[45:48.56]I put it in the chat.
[45:49.46]You look like the guy who shoves people into lockers.
[45:51.88]Really?
[45:52.30]We just talked about how I'm 5'7".
[45:54.54]That's not even physically possible.
[45:56.00]I didn't even live in the same state as you, and yet I bet you were on my high school football team.
[46:01.28]Maybe as, like, the fucking running back.
[46:03.96]Maybe as, like, the bench warmer.
[46:04.82]Maybe you stole a few of my girlfriends.
[46:06.32]You could have taken all of them.
[46:07.60]Jesus.
[46:07.96]Yeah, maybe I'm, like, Adam Sandler's fucking water boy.
[46:10.99]There is a picture of you apparently covered in shaving cream, though.
[46:14.43]What?
[46:15.03]Called the egg.
[46:16.47]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[46:17.47]That's the egg.
[46:18.11]Oh.
[46:18.75]That's not me.
[46:19.45]That's a different person.
[46:20.67]Oh.
[46:22.66]Fair enough.
[46:23.58]Yeah, you're right.
[46:24.20]Okay, that makes sense.
[46:25.04]How fucking dare you insult our guest like that?
[46:26.94]Dude, you ever look up your name online and just look at it and go like, holy shit, what the fuck is wrong with me?
[46:33.66]Every single day for hours.
[46:38.68]I guess sometimes I have that fear of any future employer is gonna be not happy.
[46:44.29]Yeah, I know, right?
[46:46.31]Well, that's why you gotta get an investment in cryptocurrency so you don't have to worry about future employers.
[46:51.33]So I can piss away my investments today instead, and kill myself before the future arrives.
[46:56.49]Jesus Christ!
[47:00.32]Well, you brought up cryptos now, so you've piqued my interest.
[47:02.58]Are you actually in cryptos?
[47:03.92]Oh, dude, I don't know if you want to start this conversation.
[47:07.99]How much have you lost?
[47:09.27]I only bring it up because Andrew and I have been in it for, what, almost two years now.
[47:12.49]Excuse me.
[47:12.99]Excuse me.
[47:13.23]I don't lose.
[47:14.95]I don't lose.
[47:15.45]How much have you lost?
[47:16.23]Like 10 grand.
[47:17.00]I'm just behind on winning 10 grand is all.
[47:21.06]No, no, no.
[47:22.98]I got interested in Bitcoin in like 2011.
[47:28.66]But, but, I never like mined it, never bought it.
[47:32.90]I thought it was cool.
[47:34.36]But then you, oh, this is a coin that people use to buy drugs on the dark net.
[47:39.99]Oh, I don't know if I'm so keen on getting that right now.
[47:43.57]But I thought the technology was really cool.
[47:45.75]And then obviously like years later, like 2014, 15, 16, it was like, oh, this is a real thing.
[47:50.79]I love the idea of distributed ledger.
[47:54.80]I'm super, super into it.
[47:57.08]Have you bought some now?
[47:58.53]Have you got a little wallet?
[48:00.87]Yeah, I dabble.
[48:03.65]I like to say interested, not invested.
[48:06.97]Just a little bit of spending money here and there.
[48:09.59]Interested, not invested.
[48:11.07]Yeah, yeah.
[48:12.21]How many SIA coins have you interested in?
[48:14.18]I was interested in SIA...
[48:18.48]A year or two ago.
[48:19.19]Holy shit.
[48:20.41]The guy who owned the Silk Road is still in prison and he's serving a life sentence.
[48:24.61]Hey, you know, see, he just got listed on Binance.
[48:26.53]Did he really?
[48:26.93]What was the Silk Road thing again?
[48:29.32]That was where a lot of people used cryptocurrencies for the drugs and stuff.
[48:32.50]Right, right.
[48:33.88]Life sentence for what?
[48:35.42]He sold pot.
[48:36.34]Who gives a fuck?
[48:37.33]It wasn't just pot, was it?
[48:38.87]No, it was a... It had a whole... Yeah, there was a lot of fucked up shit on Silk Road.
[48:43.55]Yeah, they had a lot more than just... It wasn't just like weed.
[48:47.21]Your website's not doing too great when the first line of Wikipedia is Silk Road was an online black market and dark net.
[48:53.95]Yeah.
[48:54.53]It was just weed.
[48:56.76]They can't prove otherwise.
[48:57.90]We only sold banned hentai.
[49:00.22]God.
[49:04.60]I like the whole idea of a peer-to-peer kind of cash system where there's no central authority, decentralized.
[49:11.48]It hits all the notes for me, I think.
[49:15.68]I feel that.
[49:16.64]Andrew and I have been in there for a while.
[49:17.84]He's the one that opened my eyes to it, and now I have a whole bunch of shit that I've just been squatting on for the last year and a half or however long it's been.
[49:24.81]No, yeah, it's good stuff.
[49:26.51]I feel kind of bad because I mean I got in at a good time but then a bit later I was like you know what I want to get more in and then ever since then it just has not moved so I'm kind of like oh come on like you just watch it and sit on it but nothing's happening so I'm just kind of like what taking out a third mortgage yeah oh it's riding on this one baby it's dangerous though man because like there's like 2 000 of these Pokemons and you want to you want them all you want every Pokémon in the whole crypto Pokémon universe
[49:54.77]it can get addictive I mean uh most most uh modern just financial traders don't even fucking bother with stocks anymore they just swap cryptos left and right well it's just so volatile it's so much more fun yeah pump and dump it's like a game almost yeah it's gamification of currency I mean pump and dumps are a huge thing now there's companies where they just go hey give us all your money we'll just like put it in a coin that's really volatile wait an hour and then give you the return and that's it
[50:19.01]Yeah, remember when one of those shut down and people were considering killing themselves.
[50:23.34]BitConnect.
[50:23.94]Oh god, BitConnect.
[50:24.90]BitConnect.
[50:25.60]Bit fucking Connect, aka how I lost my life.
[50:27.94]That was fucking delicious to read.
[50:29.44]I loved it.
[50:30.78]Oh my god, the men on there.
[50:33.10]I lost my family savings.
[50:34.84]Carlos Machos will live forever.
[50:37.08]I mean, in a way, they deserve it because they're like, I took out all my savings and a mortgage.
[50:41.79]I made my wife quit her job and sell her jewelry so I could put all of it into this.
[50:46.13]It's like, well, what the fuck did you expect?
[50:47.99]It's like the rule number one of investing.
[50:50.75]Yeah, never invest what you can't afford to lose.
[50:53.05]And they decided to invest everything.
[50:54.75]That's the whole interested, not invested, right?
[50:57.58]You can put some money into something if you know, oh, this is just...
[51:02.20]You know, whatever happens, happens.
[51:03.72]And I'm not going to dump my fucking... I'm not going to get equity out of my house to put it into, like, Ethereum.
[51:09.81]Like, I'm not going to do that.
[51:12.01]Well, you should.
[51:13.01]Yeah, that would have been a smart call.
[51:14.95]Not right now.
[51:15.57]I'm not sure that's a good idea right this second.
[51:18.70]Some guy did that a long time ago.
[51:21.96]When I first got into it, I read a story from a guy who sold his house for, I think it was $300,000.
[51:27.94]He paid off his house or something.
[51:30.78]He sold it, put every single cent into Ethereum, and Ethereum blew up.
[51:36.94]So that man is living the high life.
[51:39.20]He even did an update.
[51:41.00]See, fucking idiots hear stories like that, though, when they think it's gonna happen for everybody.
[51:45.55]I know.
[51:45.89]I feel so bad about that shit.
[51:47.85]It's sad.
[51:49.07]I feel so bad about that shit, because I didn't get it when it was the huge craze where it's like, Bitcoin's $10, like, none of that shit.
[51:55.35]But when I got in, I just could have put so much more in and still had a significant return today, but whatever.
[52:02.38]Ugh, I hate thinking about that shit.
[52:03.50]It's just not going to happen.
[52:04.12]It's still, at the end of the day, it's a gamble.
[52:05.78]It's no different than saying, I knew this college kid.
[52:08.94]He quit school.
[52:09.86]He dropped out of school.
[52:10.84]He joined this hockey team, and now he's a billionaire playing for the big leagues.
[52:15.86]Yeah, it's probably not going to happen for everybody, though.
[52:18.04]So everybody should not drop out of school, just like with Bill Gates and the other guy.
[52:22.29]Think about this, right, too.
[52:24.57]If you were one of those people that mined BTC back like six and seven years ago,
[52:31.07]And you... Oh, whatever.
[52:32.31]This is just like a funny fucking internet money.
[52:34.85]And then that computer is lost and you had like 3,000 BTC.
[52:39.78]I don't want to be that guy.
[52:41.16]Yeah.
[52:42.34]I'd rather miss the boat than be the guy that is like searching through the dump right now for his hard drive that has 1,000 BTC on it.
[52:48.37]You guys think maybe like there's ever maybe this if this ever happened like let's say a child Pornographer his hard drive crashes.
[52:56.73]He doesn't know if he should bring it to the service to have it restored He has Bitcoin on it and incriminating evidence.
[53:02.83]What does he do?
[53:05.99]No, I mean in this position would you bring that hard drive to the repair service I
[53:16.50]What kind of BTC are we talking about here?
[53:18.60]I guess more than... I don't know.
[53:20.06]Let's say a million dollars.
[53:21.00]Why don't you take that gamble?
[53:22.70]A million dollars in Bitcoin.
[53:24.87]That's such a hard question.
[53:25.81]And he has to have it repaired.
[53:27.85]You could bribe the repairman.
[53:29.53]That's exactly what I was thinking.
[53:30.63]It depends on where you take it.
[53:32.91]If it's enough BTC, you could definitely bribe the repair guy.
[53:35.76]But then, if I was a repair guy, I'd go, okay, so you're a kiddy fucker and you're rich.
[53:39.38]Okay.
[53:40.28]I'm gonna blackmail you out of every fucking penny and your underpants.
[53:46.48]I'd, uh, I mean, I'd just find an underground repairman.
[53:49.28]I guarantee you there's computer repair people who do this shady shit.
[53:53.73]Yeah.
[53:55.23]I guarantee you there'd be someone in that dark net who's like, I know how to do it, and also I like little boys.
[54:00.41]Like, we'd be the best friends.
[54:02.67]I'll take the porn as payments, please.
[54:05.21]Yeah, keep the Bitcoin.
[54:06.56]I just want the porn.
[54:10.03]Get that guy in the fucking, get that guy in the clink.
[54:11.87]You know what I mean?
[54:12.65]Like, I don't know.
[54:14.17]You got a million dollars in BTC, get him in the clink.
[54:17.53]Fuck Bitcoin.
[54:19.45]We hear these stories about how computing is expensive.
[54:23.31]How Bitcoin mining is burning through all of these graphics cards and shooting up the prices and shit.
[54:28.74]But how do you get 58 terabytes of child porn?
[54:32.26]You guys hear about that story?
[54:34.02]The pedophile who was arrested?
[54:36.06]No, no, no, no, no Jared Fogle had like five terabytes.
[54:38.90]This guy had 58 or something understand like why would you ever You know, I've got an idea, you know, I'm like a fucking sick fuck Let me just hold on to like 70 computers worth of pot child porn
[54:56.21]What the fuck?
[54:57.17]It's mind-boggling.
[54:58.47]Get in the goddamn clink.
[55:00.71]Get in the fucking clink where you belong, you know what I mean?
[55:02.53]He's got to catch them all.
[55:03.47]He's got to get them all.
[55:04.40]He's got to have the biggest collection.
[55:05.72]He's got to be the best.
[55:06.64]Where do you even store that?
[55:07.68]Somebody, please.
[55:08.30]Okay, you know what?
[55:09.06]I'm sure we have dedicated fans.
[55:10.92]Somebody please do the math about how many CDs that is.
[55:14.26]It has to be like an Olympic pool of Blu-rays.
[55:17.35]How do you store that shit?
[55:18.49]You'd be storing them on hard drives, surely.
[55:20.15]Yeah, I know, but I just want to know what's in CDs.
[55:23.59]I don't even get that fucking idea for like regular pornography.
[55:26.49]I get bored of a porn picture like two seconds after looking at it.
[55:29.65]Why would I want to keep 58 terabytes of it?
[55:33.48]You know what?
[55:34.38]It might be native 4K image.
[55:37.26]Maybe he makes like a slideshow and just has them cycle through it and it's random and he's surprised every time.
[55:43.58]Yeah, it's called a big house.
[55:44.84]That's what it's called.
[55:47.98]He just sits in a room with monitors like the guy from Matrix.
[55:52.06]The jail architect.
[55:54.27]The police enter his room and he turns around in his chair.
[55:56.83]I knew you would come.
[55:59.47]He's already got his hands behind his back.
[56:01.13]Would you believe me when I said this has happened six times before?
[56:06.03]I know every move you're about to make.
[56:08.04]You're thinking about arresting me.
[56:11.08]They're slamming his head into the car.
[56:12.60]This is all inevitable.
[56:13.76]This is causality.
[56:14.88]I would hope the guard would eat that key.
[56:18.26]You know, like they do back in the old, like, Tom and Jerry cartoons, like, you know, like, hey, you got, like, 58 terabytes, you fucking weirdo.
[56:24.64]And then he turns around and just, like, eats the fucking king in front of him.
[56:29.23]And that guy dies because, like, you can't eat brass, so he's gonna rip through your intestines.
[56:32.53]Like, that was a stupid idea.
[56:33.59]Why'd you do that?
[56:35.03]It's a statement.
[56:35.61]It's a power stance.
[56:38.72]What's amazing to me, though, is how much porn do you think exists on the internet?
[56:43.72]Just on the surface internet, how much porn do you think exists?
[56:46.23]Because a terabyte, I think, no one quite grasps how much information is stored on 58 terabytes worth of anything.
[56:54.77]I think that's more than all of the porn on the entire surface web.
[56:58.08]Half the internet.
[56:58.80]I know.
[56:59.82]Absolutely not.
[57:00.84]Not even close.
[57:01.64]Yeah, absolutely not.
[57:02.94]Charlie, think about it this way.
[57:04.18]A standard 10 minute video can be upwards of like 15 gigabytes.
[57:10.06]According to psychology today.
[57:13.49]Yeah, and they want the highest quality children that they can get.
[57:16.31]It's absolutely not 58 terabytes, though.
[57:20.83]Absolutely not.
[57:21.87]Way more.
[57:22.61]Well, I don't know about that.
[57:23.87]I think you're really underestimating how large a terabyte is, because a normal video... The porn is always described as being, like, the highest amount of information on the internet.
[57:34.62]According to this article, 58...
[57:37.42]58 terabytes are 7.5 million digital photographs or 29,000 hours of video.
[57:44.81]And I looked it up, 29,000 hours is roughly 3.3 years that this man could sit straight in front of a monitor and watch porn.
[57:52.70]Maybe that was his plan.
[57:54.40]Alright, I got my IV hooked up.
[57:55.92]My eyes are welded open.
[57:57.24]Let's get this started.
[57:59.34]Welded open.
[58:01.08]It's very, very painful and complicated.
[58:02.48]Get that key on a string and put it in front of his cell.
[58:05.48]And do the fucking prank video with the dollar bill where they pull the fucking dollar bill away from the person that comes over and tries to grab it.
[58:12.30]Get that shit on camera.
[58:13.46]Then fucking eat it in front of him.
[58:15.40]Put him in a saw game.
[58:16.74]You really want to eat this key.
[58:18.68]Yeah, that key's gotta get eaten by somebody.
[58:20.08]I'm super into eating the key, I don't know why.
[58:21.38]That's why, Kaya, you mentioned that.
[58:22.79]That's why I fucking hate horror movies like that.
[58:24.65]Because you have, like, the jigsaw killer, and he's like, you cheated on your husband.
[58:28.65]You're an evil, terrible person.
[58:30.13]I put you in this game that'll rip you in half.
[58:32.03]It's like, what about these people?
[58:34.05]Come on.
[58:35.13]Honestly, that's such a good point.
[58:36.53]That's the worst human you could find, you stupid fuck.
[58:40.02]You have cancer.
[58:40.70]You want to find people who don't appreciate life.
[58:43.40]The best you could do is a guy who just had a drunken one-night stand.
[58:47.40]Fuck you, Jigsaw.
[58:48.74]Come on.
[58:49.08]Jigsaw definitely had 58 gigabytes of porn.
[58:52.55]Jigsaw's like 75 years old.
[58:53.55]He doesn't know how to use the internet.
[58:54.53]He's like a grandfather.
[58:55.43]Yeah.
[58:56.43]He finds the guy smoking like fucking crack on the sidewalk and he's like, you're a bad guy.
[59:00.77]Get over here.
[59:01.87]It's just really conservative.
[59:03.99]You cheated on your wife.
[59:05.99]She was home making you dinner.
[59:08.53]You're a bad man.
[59:09.86]Your baby didn't get bees.
[59:11.46]What if the whole secret plot of the Jigsaw series is that because Jigsaw's so old, he's just a super conservative old man.
[59:16.74]So like Jigsaw 10, it's like a married gay couple.
[59:19.82]You have committed sin against God.
[59:22.12]This is not allowed.
[59:25.12]I wonder if they're gonna get past the new Saw, because they rebooted it and it fucking flopped a little hard.
[59:29.74]I'm curious to see if they'll even bother.
[59:31.31]That was a reboot?
[59:33.01]Yeah, it was a soft reboot.
[59:35.01]Yeah, that movie was supposed to be like resetting the franchise for sequels.
[59:39.21]Because it's like, here's his new protege.
[59:41.61]Saw's just like Jason or like Freddy.
[59:43.67]It's the same damn thing.
[59:44.69]It's just a different bad guy swallowing a key in front of the guy that's downloading Falcon.
[59:48.89]You really like this idea.
[59:51.51]I think Jerma's version of hell is he's stuck in a box and he has no way out, but he sees it, but he knows he can't get it.
[59:57.53]No, no, I'm the goddamn, I'm the demon swallowing the key.
[60:00.96]I think Jerma's got 58 terabytes of key porn or some shit.
[60:05.78]58 terabytes of men dangling for ways to get out of their predicament.
[60:13.57]I think about that kind of stuff a lot too, though.
[60:15.87]Just torturing these people.
[60:17.95]Sometimes it's like, when I lie in bed... Wait, wait, hold on a second.
[60:22.21]Jeremiah, have you met Kaya?
[60:25.06]Just today, actually.
[60:27.68]No, these kind of people, you know, it brings peace to my mind.
[60:33.17]Oh, actually, Jerma, I'll have you know, when I first met Kaya, one of the first things I got to know about him is he used to be like kind of an old Avenger, if you could call him that, where he would send like really hard viruses to like people that tried to talk to underage people on the internet.
[60:51.14]He'd pose as a girl or something.
[60:52.76]That's how you made him for the first time.
[60:55.07]That makes you sound like a pedophile.
[60:56.31]He came over and fixed this computer later.
[60:59.99]You know, I hit him up one time.
[61:02.64]Have I not told the story on the podcast?
[61:04.42]No, we talked about it.
[61:05.12]I'm just filling in Jerma.
[61:06.06]He had an ASL in his AIM profile that I was checking out.
[61:10.50]Basically, yeah.
[61:11.94]Yeah, and then he just sent them a virus that fucking destroyed their computer.
[61:15.09]That was what he did.
[61:15.89]It's just like his hobby.
[61:17.75]He has this very strong sense of justice.
[61:20.91]So instead of swallowing a key, he's blowing up computers.
[61:23.33]So there you go.
[61:24.49]You get it, huh?
[61:25.97]Yeah, I guess he's on the same page.
[61:28.65]Before we forget to toss it over to the Patreon questions, though, we should do that because you've been a highly anticipated guest within the official podcast community.
[61:35.90]So they've got some real zingers for you, Jerma.
[61:39.92]I'm ready.
[61:40.26]What do we have for Jackson?
[61:41.30]Go ahead, Charlie.
[61:42.00]Go ahead, Charlie.
[61:42.68]Yeah, go ahead, Charlie.
[61:43.48]You sounded ready to do it.
[61:45.58]Well, I did not like the Patreon.
[61:47.30]Pull your weight.
[61:48.52]Oh.
[61:48.98]Oh.
[61:49.08]Oh, I guess I'll have to take over again.
[61:50.82]It's the usual.
[61:52.38]Jerma, this is a good question from... I lost the name.
[61:55.78]I can't find it.
[61:56.58]Where did it go?
[61:57.21]Here it is.
[61:59.57]Oh, God.
[62:00.27]My page fucking refreshed when I opened it.
[62:02.01]Hang on.
[62:03.21]Give me a second.
[62:05.64]Okay, I found it.
[62:06.24]It's from Brady Dean.
[62:08.70]Do you enjoy putting time and effort into large-scale projects like the live-action Jerma Rumble, or do you prefer smaller jokes that you can throw around together such as your magic tricks and PC doctor streams?
[62:20.38]Oh, I think both.
[62:21.82]I think they serve a different purpose.
[62:23.32]So the larger-scale projects are very planned, whereas something like me getting a bunch of children's magic kits is just for fun.
[62:34.68]And I think both of them serve their purpose.
[62:36.56]I think it just depends on what I feel like doing at the time.
[62:40.40]Because sometimes these random ideas, the last one, for instance, the polygraph stream, right?
[62:48.58]That was just a spur of the moment, hey, I'm doing this now.
[62:52.65]Somebody called me like a liar, and I was like, I'm not a fucking liar.
[62:56.07]Oh, you know what?
[62:56.61]I'll prove it, right?
[62:57.81]And then that kind of chat interaction leading into an idea,
[63:03.16]is as fun as, hey, I'm going to plan for like three weeks to make some project.
[63:08.42]So I think they both serve their own purpose.
[63:10.78]Would you say that they're both as equally fulfilling to create?
[63:14.36]Definitely, yeah.
[63:16.51]One is more on the fly, and the other one is kind of production, in a sense.
[63:22.77]So do you have any upcoming large productions that you're thinking about?
[63:26.71]Yes.
[63:28.54]Two.
[63:29.22]Please.
[63:34.37]This is why I'm moving.
[63:36.21]Give us the scoop, Gemma.
[63:37.51]Give us the scoop.
[63:38.07]This is why I'm moving to Vegas.
[63:38.73]He's got this jail cell and this key, and he's going to film.
[63:41.18]Eat that fucking key!
[63:46.64]This is why I'm moving to Vegas.
[63:48.74]I am moving to Las Vegas in like two months.
[63:51.62]You're becoming a gambling addict.
[63:53.19]I can't control it.
[63:55.93]I can't stop playing Roulette 22 Red, and I do it every time, and I think I'm going to win a million dollars, and I just lose it.
[64:02.09]Man, roulette is so much fun.
[64:03.59]What's your favorite gambling game?
[64:07.58]Hold on a second here.
[64:10.20]The easiest to win, the lowest house edge at the casino, what is it?
[64:15.28]Blackjack.
[64:17.53]That's not true.
[64:18.97]Oh, no, wait, it's craps.
[64:20.31]It's a certain bit in craps.
[64:22.17]It's actually... That Chinese game.
[64:23.41]It's actually Baccarat.
[64:25.16]Really?
[64:26.18]Baccarat is... Look, you can reverse the house edge with Blackjack, but straight up, Baccarat is a coin toss.
[64:34.99]It is one of the lowest house edge games at a whole casino.
[64:38.01]I love it.
[64:38.50]You know, I've never actually played Baccarat because there's only one casino in Tampa.
[64:42.70]It's the Hard Rock and they don't have it probably for that very reason.
[64:46.10]Yeah, it's not easy to scam people.
[64:48.22]It's a very low house edge game.
[64:51.81]I just love roulette.
[64:52.55]Roulette's fun.
[64:53.21]No, it is, for sure.
[64:54.07]I love all the fucking gambling games.
[64:56.45]I think roulette is the most intricately designed casino game ever, because you would think that it's like you could always bid red or black and it's 50-50, but then they got those fucking zeros, which aren't a color.
[65:06.45]It's brilliant how well engineered that game is to never be in your favor.
[65:09.49]No, you haven't seen that Chinese, I think it's Chinese gambling, I forget the name of it, but where they put the two big dice in this jar and it shakes it around.
[65:18.85]oh yeah it's the big bubble and it jumbles yeah yeah yeah that's so much that's so cool but yeah but people do oh put a hundred dollars on black they think it's 50 50 it's not yeah it's not one of the most fucking simply roulette is just so well designed to always not be in your favor it's great but roulette it's a slow game though so that's why it's fun to play
[65:42.96]Because it takes a while for every game to start, and you go, oh, I'm going to put like five bucks on one.
[65:47.72]Like, okay.
[65:49.38]Like, five minutes later, you get to play again.
[65:52.18]Takes a while for you to lose all your money.
[65:54.15]Yeah.
[65:55.15]I love Baccarat, though.
[65:55.87]It's my favorite game at the casino.
[65:58.53]So, what are you going to Vegas for before we get off that subject?
[66:01.47]The two big projects?
[66:02.71]Because I can't stop my gambling addiction.
[66:05.61]No.
[66:07.05]The two, they're one of which, you know, whatever.
[66:11.35]Fuck it.
[66:11.61]Who cares?
[66:13.42]So I killed Santa Claus on stream.
[66:16.80]It was one of the things I did.
[66:18.55]I accidentally did it.
[66:20.81]This is all off the record, as we are aware.
[66:24.17]But one of the big... Wait, what?
[66:26.79]I may have accidentally killed somebody on my stream in December.
[66:32.08]And there'll be a trial.
[66:35.46]In Vegas.
[66:36.82]Yep.
[66:37.58]They're going to gamble your sentence.
[66:39.04]But that's why I'm... Okay, so, like, obviously, this is sort of, you know, I've been holding on to this for a while, but doing a trial in a real courtroom with a bunch of actors...
[66:52.95]is really fucking hard to do around here.
[66:56.53]So me and a guy that produces a lot of, he's like a superhero.
[67:01.31]One of the guys that I work with that helps me out with pretty much every project.
[67:05.69]He is, he's been trying for the last like four and a half, five months to get us into a courtroom.
[67:15.52]And you wouldn't believe how fucking hard that is to do around here in like Massachusetts.
[67:18.84]Are you talking about dick or something?
[67:21.88]He's been trying to do the same thing.
[67:23.08]He's trying to record a certain court transcript as a comedy skit.
[67:28.09]Sounds really familiar.
[67:28.95]You two should hook up.
[67:30.43]I don't know.
[67:31.11]Sneak into a courtroom together.
[67:32.51]You have a common goal.
[67:34.67]Well, I wanted to be there legally.
[67:36.85]I wanted to be there legally.
[67:38.40]There's going to be a big beautiful door on that courthouse.
[67:42.54]You know what I mean?
[67:44.66]A whole production.
[67:45.42]Yep.
[67:47.10]Is that going to be a live show or is that going to be created?
[67:50.21]And the chat is the jury.
[67:53.23]Oh, that's cool.
[67:54.45]That's really cool.
[67:57.11]That's the purpose of moving to Las Vegas.
[68:00.54]So it'll be like a Twitch does courtroom.
[68:03.38]Twitch decides a man's life.
[68:05.14]The chat is going to be in the jury booth and all the cameras will be in their perspective.
[68:10.62]That's so cool.
[68:11.16]Let's scratch this up so we're stealing the idea.
[68:13.54]Yeah, we're doing it right now.
[68:15.64]You better move to Vegas because it's tough.
[68:18.32]I'm going live.
[68:19.00]Let's do it.
[68:19.90]We've been denied.
[68:21.10]But that's what I mean when I talk about content and moving and changing direction.
[68:26.27]It's really hard to convince somebody to, hey, we want to do a live skit in your courthouse.
[68:36.71]No, that's not going to happen.
[68:38.61]No, get the fuck out of here.
[68:39.65]What are you talking about?
[68:40.31]What's Twitch?
[68:42.63]Out on the West Coast?
[68:44.11]It's way easier to get this shit done.
[68:47.23]And over the last few months.
[68:49.11]Yeah, from like actual productions and films and stuff.
[68:51.34]That makes sense.
[68:52.14]Yeah, and paying for places and stuff like that.
[68:54.80]That was another thing.
[68:55.46]Oh, you can open a Patreon.
[68:57.42]I've fought against that idea for a long time.
[69:00.52]And there might be in the future something like that, but it depends.
[69:04.60]But that's one of the big things coming up.
[69:06.90]And the other thing is I'm going to do an ASMR stream.
[69:10.80]And you know what?
[69:11.98]Again, fuck it.
[69:13.01]This is exclusive to the official podcast, okay?
[69:17.05]Oh!
[69:17.35]That's fucking perfect.
[69:18.21]This is a first.
[69:19.53]It is a first.
[69:20.65]I'm gonna do an ASMR stream and you know how like typical like twitch.tv ASMR streams you got like the fucking binaural ear microphone?
[69:27.24]Alright, I'm gonna get one of those.
[69:29.66]Yeah, like the weird fucking creepy where like people kiss the ears and shit.
[69:34.18]Well, I'm gonna get one of those and there's gonna be a lot of weird shit that I do and one of them is I'm gonna hire a high school marching band to come in and play in my room while they go around and that's like part of the ASMR.
[69:47.27]It sounds like you have so much fun with this shit.
[69:49.91]But that's what it is, you know what I mean?
[69:53.11]Like, I told you, if I don't stay interested, I can't do it.
[69:57.17]If I'm not having fun, I fucking refuse to do it, so I better be having fun.
[70:02.40]You sound like the Willy Wonka of some bizarre shit.
[70:06.38]Hey, if you like the wall, it's schnoshberry, I promise.
[70:11.17]It's great, man.
[70:12.11]That's fucking awesome.
[70:12.93]Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[70:14.29]I appreciate you sharing that here.
[70:15.81]I really like both those ideas, especially the fucking courtroom role, and I think that's really creative.
[70:20.52]Yeah, and they get to decide, right?
[70:22.36]They'll decide if I'm guilty or innocent with evidence that's put out in front of the courtroom.
[70:30.01]Is there going to be long-lasting effects?
[70:32.09]Are you actually going to spend a week in jail or something?
[70:35.89]Well, there is something very specific.
[70:39.51]It's very specific.
[70:41.48]And I cannot necessarily share.
[70:43.08]Yeah, let's leave some secrets for the stream.
[70:46.20]Absolutely.
[70:46.66]But that's what I'm working on, and that's what's causing a lot of the ideas to move.
[70:55.25]Because it is frustrating.
[70:56.75]I don't know where you guys... One of you guys mentioned you were in Australia.
[71:01.13]Where are the rest of you guys from?
[71:04.09]I'm in Tampa, as is Andrew.
[71:05.81]And then I'm in Australia, and Kier is in Germany.
[71:11.84]But trying to get shit done is hard, unless you're in an area that caters to that kind of stuff.
[71:19.63]Mm-hmm.
[71:20.37]And I hate being that guy that promises big ideas.
[71:24.05]Oh, I'm going to do this crazy shit.
[71:25.41]It's going to be so much fun.
[71:26.45]Stay tuned.
[71:28.21]I mean, people don't move to California for the weather, scenery, or crowding or any of that shit.
[71:34.51]They move there because the scene's there.
[71:36.36]And that's why I like Vegas more than I like L.A.
[71:38.86]because Vegas is an hour plane drive to L.A.
[71:44.72]It's 50% cheaper than where I live now.
[71:48.85]And plus I can, my crippling gambling addiction, I can feed it.
[71:54.61]I hope you got a place like actually on the strip.
[71:56.87]It's in the casino.
[71:57.93]Oh god.
[71:58.51]Oh my god.
[71:59.71]I would die.
[72:00.47]You'd be out of money for your courtroom.
[72:02.81]Yeah, I would lose it all.
[72:05.41]Gotta go somewhere not downtown.
[72:07.05]I'll be one of those like statistics.
[72:11.79]Guy gets murdered on the strip.
[72:16.39]Alright, we can do another one.
[72:18.47]So, Jerma, this is from Skinness Pinnis.
[72:21.91]I mean, I'm assuming Skinny Penis.
[72:24.53]And he also wants to extend it to everyone, but I'd love to hear Jerma's answer to it.
[72:28.67]Do you have any strange habits that your audience would find interesting or even shocking to know about?
[72:36.74]Yeah, I'm a hair twirler.
[72:39.48]Like what kind of hair?
[72:41.02]Like my... Yeah, I reach down there and I fucking twirl.
[72:45.16]No.
[72:47.42]off stream and when I'm just kind of hanging out I pick up pieces of my hair and spin it around and just snap it snap it like you pull it out because I used to do that I kind of just spin it around and snap yeah well yeah it's just scratching your hair isn't it I mean essentially yeah I scratch my head that's my weird habit yeah sometimes I sneeze it's really bizarre only sometimes though
[73:14.92]I don't think I have any weird habits that people would be shocked to learn.
[73:17.90]Do you, Andrew?
[73:19.64]Um... No.
[73:23.78]I mean, like, I'm in the same place with Jerma with the hair thing.
[73:26.70]I have a bunch of single, like, just long black hairs that grow on my arms, and sometimes I just pluck them as a habit.
[73:34.89]It feels so good, though, doesn't it?
[73:36.61]God it's amazing when you like when you get those stubborn ones that keep slipping through your fingers, and then you finally get it Yes, so fucking great.
[73:43.67]I look forward to what I lie down in my bed, and I'm just like hey Kim Kim's my girlfriend I'm like Kim come over here, and she's like alright I'm gonna get the tweezers, and I lie down and I'm not a hairy man on my chest But something about her plucking the hairs out of my chest is just like yeah do that.
[73:58.10]It's great It feels good.
[74:00.46]It really does.
[74:01.14]It's gratifying Yeah
[74:04.80]What?
[74:05.10]Yeah.
[74:05.85]What is wrong with you two?
[74:07.53]Oh, it's great.
[74:08.41]No, it's nice.
[74:09.17]Gratifying.
[74:09.91]Yeah.
[74:10.33]No, I can understand it feeling good, but gratifying, like it's some kind of approval to your entire existence as a man.
[74:16.51]It's kind of weird.
[74:17.69]The only reason I'm alive.
[74:20.61]How about you, Vol?
[74:21.13]It keeps me living.
[74:23.99]Um, I struggle a lot with drinking water sometimes, like it'll go down the wrong hole and then I'll spurt up water everywhere.
[74:31.13]It's not really a habit.
[74:33.95]Like a baby?
[74:34.87]I can't drink.
[74:38.00]But the habit is that I always quote the line from Airplane, I've got a drinking problem and I'll do that no matter where I am or who I'm with, I'll always just mutter it to myself.
[74:49.96]I remember you said that on an episode.
[74:51.52]That's right.
[74:52.02]I think we did get this question once, the four of us.
[74:54.68]I didn't remember it.
[74:55.56]It's found to happen in 71 episodes.
[74:57.56]What a classic movie, by the way.
[74:59.96]It's a great movie.
[75:00.56]Such a good movie.
[75:01.66]Leslie Nielsen is one of my favorite actors.
[75:05.11]If you're listening, Leslie, you're welcome to come on the podcast.
[75:08.29]He's dead.
[75:08.93]Rest in peace.
[75:09.61]That's not going to stop Nielsen.
[75:11.37]That's true.
[75:12.21]Let her rip.
[75:13.17]How about you, Kaya?
[75:16.53]I just always need something to fiddle in my hand.
[75:19.08]Be it a pen or anything, really.
[75:22.34]I just can't keep my hands just still on the table.
[75:25.50]I'm like a little autistic child.
[75:29.29]I'm also super fidgety.
[75:30.49]I always reach for whatever's around and I just start playing with it.
[75:33.97]But I always choose, like, I typically aim for, like, the worst possible thing to twirl around and, like, flick and shit.
[75:38.68]Like, I have an SD card that I constantly just demolish just to keep my hands busy.
[75:44.14]A really expensive fidgeting thing.
[75:46.74]It's a really old one.
[75:47.81]I mean, I actually broke it from fidgeting, but it's also really old, so it's not a huge loss.
[75:52.29]I'm like, I drink a lot of coffee and half of the reason why is to have something in my hand.
[76:00.64]I have to have a drink in my hand.
[76:02.14]Have to.
[76:02.94]I can get behind that.
[76:05.04]Can't you have an empty, like, bottle or something in your hand?
[76:08.84]So that you don't have to drink it?
[76:11.24]No, I mean, this is mostly in public.
[76:15.12]If I'm out, like, talking to people, out doing something, I have to have, like, a drink in my hand, usually.
[76:19.66]Yeah.
[76:20.68]You think you look cool?
[76:21.82]No, I just, I'm wild.
[76:23.44]My hands just go everywhere, so I have to just, like, fucking keep them in the same place.
[76:27.90]I have ADHD, I'm all over the place, so... Needs to be there.
[76:32.58]Fair enough.
[76:33.50]Do we have any other Patreon questions?
[76:35.04]Yeah, uh, this is a quick and easy one.
[76:36.87]This is from Soph.
[76:38.99]Uh, out of all of your wacky and original characters and personas, who is your favorite and why?
[76:44.31]Give us like a top three.
[76:46.05]Uh, probably the egg is probably my favorite.
[76:50.15]Just because what a stupid shit character that is.
[76:52.85]It's just a guy that's an egg, that's it.
[76:56.16]There's nothing else there.
[76:58.24]Is there a character behind that?
[76:59.46]No.
[77:00.10]There's no deep Jerma lore to the egg?
[77:01.84]There's no lore, he's just an egg, that's it.
[77:05.02]Uh, Glue Man, uh, you know, the real answer is Glue Man.
[77:08.82]Because he was just a, he was a joke.
[77:10.22]Is he just glue?
[77:11.96]Well, he's like, he's a superhero that doesn't have any superpowers, he just can't really die.
[77:17.12]But he was like, I made a t-shirt with him on it that he's probably my favorite just shit character.
[77:24.16]I think probably in the entire universe of characters.
[77:26.88]Mr. Sneakman is also probably up there just because he doesn't even, there's no reason for him to exist in the first place.
[77:34.45]I said in a GTA video like three years ago, hey, it's me, Mr. Sneakman.
[77:40.65]And I got hit by a fucking car.
[77:43.78]That's it.
[77:44.48]That's it.
[77:45.34]There was no other backstory and then I made him his own person.
[77:48.92]And I think that people like latched on to that and thought it was fun that he was his own character and now he's my favorite stupid worthless fucking character I've ever made.
[77:58.97]But if I... Is there any... Glue Man is the real answer there for you.
[78:03.18]Is there any characters you've made that you would consider useful?
[78:05.63]Because I'm noticing a common theme where they all do nothing.
[78:08.71]Well, uh... Demon Lord Zaraxos is one of the leaders of the sick circle of hell.
[78:16.04]He's pretty useful.
[78:17.83]That's pretty cool, I guess.
[78:19.25]He sounds strong.
[78:20.01]He's pretty strong.
[78:20.69]So are there any that do your taxes or get you groceries?
[78:25.33]There is the apple.
[78:27.67]He's a fruit, so he's very healthy.
[78:29.03]I'm noticing a lot of your characters are just, this is what I just ate.
[78:32.53]Let's make it a character.
[78:34.67]Glue.
[78:35.59]I just ate glue.
[78:38.43]What's their character?
[78:39.45]Oh, they're that.
[78:41.15]All my characters, just pretty much take yourself back to the first grade.
[78:44.99]And think of things that you thought were, well, I'm going to eat this.
[78:50.24]That sounds good to me.
[78:51.02]I like that.
[78:52.23]I can't wait for fingernails, man, to be coming soon.
[78:56.71]Stay tuned.
[78:57.25]Thanks for the idea.
[78:58.93]Super ladle boy and his sidekick bowl man.
[79:03.73]Registered.
[79:05.63]We trademarked that idea.
[79:08.05]Yeah, now that you put it on the podcast, our ideas, we'll be taking that court thing too.
[79:13.71]We've taken Glue Man now.
[79:15.47]Take it all.
[79:16.42]And egg.
[79:17.80]You can keep apple though.
[79:18.70]Yeah, fuck apple.
[79:20.54]The apple was just some fat guy that we found.
[79:23.07]So it doesn't matter.
[79:23.65]Does he get really mad?
[79:25.05]You're just like, hey, Apple.
[79:26.05]He's like, I'm Derek.
[79:27.57]No, I don't.
[79:28.57]I met him like three times in my life.
[79:30.86]He's like a friend of a friend that didn't really didn't want to be part of the video.
[79:34.54]But he was kind of like a fat guy.
[79:35.94]So we were like, yeah, you're like kind of a fat guy.
[79:37.42]You want to be the Apple?
[79:38.18]And he's like, fine.
[79:41.18]That's it.
[79:43.12]Now that's one hell of an origin story.
[79:44.76]That's great.
[79:46.42]We're going to wrap up here now because I've got to get going.
[79:48.60]So, Jerma, do you have any last minute things to say or plug?
