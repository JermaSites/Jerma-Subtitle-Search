[00:05.92]Oh my god, look at all these cars!
[00:09.08]And they're all the same car!
[00:10.14]They're all the exact same car.
[00:13.57]I want the red one.
[00:14.85]See you later.
[00:19.61]Dude, some dealership just like made out like a bandit.
[00:22.67]Oh, those poor lady's legs!
[00:24.15]They really all are the same car.
[00:26.29]Hey look, everybody has like a Saturn.
[00:27.89]Oh, you just made me run her over.
[00:31.12]We don't have airships.
[00:32.48]Oh, that's not in Lost in the Dam?
[00:34.76]That's not in Lost in the Dam.
[00:36.26]Oh no, we're in helicopters.
[00:39.10]No, no, I've just dropped mine off so you can get some RPGs.
[00:41.26]Come to the helicopter.
[00:42.32]I don't know how to land this.
[00:43.22]I've got all my guns on this thing.
[00:44.76]I've got a crash on mine.
[00:47.03]That would suck.
[00:48.07]Landa, can you land anywhere on the construction site?
[00:50.27]There should be an open spot, like on the roof somewhere.
[00:52.97]Mine's on the ground.
[00:55.04]Dallas, can you land up here?
[00:57.68]Just watching him struggle to land this.
[01:02.14]Why do I feel like he's about to land them?
[01:03.50]Oh, God.
[01:04.69]Oh, he's going to crash into it.
[01:05.63]You're going to crash into his.
[01:08.24]Oh, you crashed on my helicopter, you fool.
[01:10.78]Etalyx, you suck.
[01:11.92]I'm still alive.
[01:12.65]There's a one place I didn't want you to land.
[01:14.73]Wait, it's still... I'm alive.
[01:19.15]you know he took off all the blades no I don't mind you but you still has a laser break yeah you still has blades can you yeah but can you get out of here without crashing it see try and move this up to the top oh this is a disaster what have you done and see what happens oh god oh this is not oh Jesus oh alright oh you idiot
[01:49.65]There's no way they will get us.
[01:52.17]It's impossible.
[01:52.87]The cops are climbing, though.
[01:54.47]Are they climbing up top?
[01:55.75]Yeah.
[01:56.11]Just get ready to shoot when he gets the air back up a little bit.
[01:59.63]Careful now.
[02:00.72]I'm climbing the ladder.
[02:01.94]Wait, yeah, that's Etalyx climbing the ladder.
[02:04.18]Oh, wait, what?
[02:05.62]That's not a police officer climbing.
[02:07.08]That's Etalyx.
[02:08.72]Oh, no!
[02:09.24]You knocked me off the ladder!
[02:11.03]What did you just do?
[02:11.87]I'm alive!
[02:13.17]I'm alive!
[02:16.31]Wow, I can't believe I landed on stealth's body and it cushioned my fall.
[02:21.47]This is scary.
[02:23.80]We may or may not have choppers coming after us.
[02:27.58]What the heck?
[02:30.60]Some of these guys are just walking around in circles.
[02:36.48]Uh-oh.
[02:36.88]Uh-oh.
[02:38.34]What have I done?
[02:40.20]What'd you do?
[02:40.52]Oh!
[02:41.43]Oh!
[02:43.35]Oh, no!
[02:45.93]Don't fall down the hole.
[02:48.21]What just happened there?
[02:49.35]You're drunk.
[02:54.02]You dropped like a bomb behind me and it flew me down the hole!
[02:57.10]Oh no!
[03:01.78]What?
[03:05.04]What?
[03:06.54]I don't... All I heard was, oops, that's not good, and all of a sudden I fly, my body falls into the freaking hole.
[03:14.24]It went down the tube?
[03:16.60]Yeah, I rolled, like, I was like a piece of, like, hair going down a bathroom sink.
[03:23.01]These are the crappiest cars you guys could possibly find, aren't they?
[03:27.43]We are regular people.
[03:29.01]We don't have, like, $700,000 nitro cars.
[03:32.21]This is, like, something I could buy on Craigslist.
[03:38.14]Oh, and Stealth's back here with his freaking mic.
[03:40.18]I found a nice car.
[03:43.58]He's got, like, a new Ford Red.
[03:44.90]Are we starting now?
[03:46.32]No, no, hold on.
[03:46.88]Wait, we gotta get the rules down here.
[03:47.99]Hold on.
[03:48.27]Alright.
[03:49.79]So, if you break the rule... I've already been in a collision with MLC_St3alth.
[03:54.73]I'm gonna have to file with my insurance.
[03:57.25]Because he bumped my car.
[03:59.84]What, just now?
[04:00.66]Yeah, he just bumped my car, so I'm gonna... I need you to step out, please, and give me your license and registration number.
[04:08.58]so I can write it down on my notepad.
[04:10.86]Alright.
[04:13.14]Wait, look!
[04:14.88]You just ran into my car.
[04:16.69]I was tired of you.
[04:20.15]Hey, that's against the law.
[04:21.69]You bumped into my car.
[04:22.65]Look, you dented the front.
[04:23.95]I can't even use this car now.
[04:24.85]I'm not happy.
[04:25.49]Game of Descent just blew up our radio.
[04:28.43]Okay, let's go.
[04:30.65]Everybody get in the car.
[04:34.29]Oh, you alright?
[04:35.59]Oh my gosh.
[04:38.87]Oh, I now have a star.
[04:41.17]That lasted a long time.
[04:44.27]Okay, I'm done.
[04:46.23]Then we all lose.
[04:50.01]Well, one star turned into three.
[04:51.76]This escalated quickly.
[04:52.70]I don't even know what kind of lane this road is.
[04:54.76]Here we go.
[04:55.56]It's time to obey the rules of the road, starting now.
[04:59.70]We are now law-abiding citizens.
[05:01.56]Is there like a speed limit button?
[05:05.59]That guy just passed us.
[05:11.63]What is this?
[05:13.28]What was that all about?
[05:14.02]You're supposed to pull to the right.
[05:16.96]Oh, excuse me.
[05:24.54]My right blinker is on.
[05:25.60]I'm going to be taking a right hand turn here.
[05:27.07]I broke your right tail light by accident.
[05:29.23]Oh crap, I'm taking a right.
[05:30.63]Hey, look at this guy.
[05:31.77]Look at him.
[05:32.71]Hey, you need to calm down, buddy.
[05:36.27]This is a robbery.
[05:37.23]What is this guy doing?
[05:38.22]What?
[05:52.23]Oh no, they're swarming us!
[05:53.81]This is a state operation, what's happening?
[05:57.11]I was a witness to the crime, I'm gonna pull over.
[05:59.12]I may have three stars by accident.
[06:01.58]You have three stars?
[06:02.70]Oh, they're gonna pull you out, Boo.
[06:03.70]Oh, this cop is right next to me, he's gonna pull me out.
[06:05.38]Go!
[06:05.62]Not my problem.
[06:06.52]I'm still obeying the rules, not my problem.
[06:09.78]Drive, but drive safely.
[06:10.88]He's in my car.
[06:12.66]He's in my car.
[06:13.80]This guy's passing, oh, what is he doing?
[06:16.52]It's a red light.
[06:17.90]Oh, Boo's in your car.
[06:21.72]Red light!
[06:22.12]The cops just rammed us.
[06:24.40]You have to get them away from you.
[06:26.42]Yeah, but it's a red light, Boo.
[06:27.90]I don't think we can go yet.
[06:28.88]Hang on.
[06:29.29]No, it's green.
[06:29.87]It's green.
[06:30.35]It's green.
[06:30.97]It's green.
[06:32.09]Okay, it's green.
[06:34.85]Get out of here.
[06:36.07]Oh, no!
[06:36.61]I did it again!
[06:37.63]Oh, my... They're just being so bossy.
[06:41.21]They're just pushing us everywhere.
[06:43.11]I'm going to be taking a left-hander here.
[06:45.71]I'm going to be taking fire on my vehicle.
[06:51.90]Oh my god!
[06:52.30]Look how scratched it is!
[06:54.37]Oh no!
[06:55.17]It's the cop, man.
[06:58.07]He's like pulling up alongside.
[07:03.38]It's green though!
[07:05.08]It's green!
[07:05.84]Oh no!
[07:09.50]Oh no, this is a one-way!
[07:10.56]This is a one-way back up!
[07:12.10]Oh, you know what's not right?
[07:13.80]They're pushing us sideways, I can't... I can't do this, Boo.
[07:19.43]They're just ramming us non-stop.
[07:22.13]They're being so aggressive.
[07:24.75]I'm just trying to be an innocent bystander driving safely, and this cop is pulling up and pulling out a shotgun in my face!
