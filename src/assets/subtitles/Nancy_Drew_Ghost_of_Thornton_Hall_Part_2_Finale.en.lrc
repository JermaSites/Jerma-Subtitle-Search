[ve:61.1.100]

[00:50.48]Good afternoon.
[00:51.76]How are we?
[00:55.54]You probably noticed the title of this stream.
[00:59.24]The observing eye would be able to see it.
[01:01.28]Yeah.
[01:04.04]I told you that I was going to finish Nancy Drew within seven to 10 business days of the last time I played it.
[01:14.39]And that's exactly what happened.
[01:18.03]The package went around in a circle around the Earth three or four times.
[01:24.57]It showed up on your front door.
[01:26.16]With a bunch of dirt all over it.
[01:28.68]Kicked in.
[01:30.02]Smushed.
[01:31.18]You picked it up.
[01:31.66]You shook it a little.
[01:33.40]It just sounded like a bunch of broken glass in there.
[01:36.94]But it made it.
[01:37.76]It's here.
[01:38.52]Here it is.
[01:49.24]so uh we're gonna do it then we're gonna play some wow well here's the thing I need to see how long this takes to beat this I I only have like an hour left I might have more than that um I'm gonna I'm gonna use a guide if I get too stuck I don't even I who cares it's been a month I don't remember anything I have a full inventory of items I don't even know what they do
[02:13.20]So let's beat it together.
[02:14.52]We're just going to beat this together.
[02:15.50]We're going to get through the last 45 minutes.
[02:17.32]If there's a puzzle I just don't want to do, then we're just going to... I'll just ask you for answers or I'll look it over at a guide.
[02:23.05]I don't know who gives a shit.
[02:27.05]Just watch a Let's Play app.
[02:28.29]Alright, let me... Let's get the ads out of the way.
[02:35.39]And I'll be back.
[02:36.49]I'm going to grab my stuff and make sure I'm ready.
[02:39.88]I'll be back in a few minutes.
[02:44.43]Here they come.
[06:13.82]alright I have sat back down but I think there's still about 30 seconds left good
[06:40.04]Yeah, I drank a soda.
[06:42.74]It is bubbling.
[06:44.06]I just, it's crazy.
[06:58.51]Okay.
[06:59.89]We're good.
[07:02.03]I sat back down.
[07:04.85]Rerolls are off for an hour, so that's good.
[07:07.82]Cool.
[07:10.51]I drank a soda and it's just coming up on me here.
[07:13.15]It's... It's inside of... It's like I keep having to... Gas keeps coming out.
[07:20.63]Not this top way.
[07:22.10]Not the other way.
[07:24.60]I could have just said burp.
[07:26.10]But whatever.
[07:27.24]You know me.
[07:27.74]I can't fucking just tell you anything directly.
[07:30.52]Alright, so Nancy Drew.
[07:31.78]I don't remember anything at all.
[07:33.56]Zero.
[07:35.18]We're just going to see how it goes.
[07:36.20]If I get... I'm going to need help.
[07:40.47]You can't just stop watching a TV show after let's say season one and there's 10 episodes in the season.
[07:49.79]If you watch seven episodes and then just don't watch it for a month, I kind of feel like you need a recap.
[07:58.26]So let's go.
[08:04.46]I don't remember anything.
[08:06.46]I don't even know which save file is correct.
[08:10.75]This one is called Chops.
[08:12.69]I don't know which one is which.
[08:14.67]Does anybody remember?
[08:16.07]I think it's this one, right?
[08:22.45]Not the second one.
[08:23.29]Not the second one.
[08:24.83]Okay, so it's this one.
[08:27.15]I've got so much shit in my inventory.
[08:30.90]Look at all these missions.
[08:31.98]Look at all these quests I have.
[08:38.66]Alright, what did I do?
[08:39.86]Did I find Jessalyn?
[08:41.76]I did not.
[08:43.94]Did I find a way to enter the room at the end of the hall?
[08:46.76]Yeah, good luck remembering that from Episode 7.
[08:48.79]I got the phone- Wait, I got the phone password?
[08:54.35]What is it?
[08:54.65]Okay, I don't know.
[08:59.49]Anyone remember the password?
[09:03.33]Complete the epitaph hunt Jessalyn and Addison were working on.
[09:07.79]I guess I did that too.
[09:08.67]Find a way to unlock the door in the tunnels.
[09:16.37]Did I do that?
[09:18.97]Check out the odd dirt floor from Canberra's picture library.
[09:23.28]Did I do that?
[09:29.58]This one?
[09:30.80]Okay, I don't think I did that.
[09:34.08]Still have to do that.
[09:34.94]Alright.
[09:35.16]So I got to do that.
[09:36.82]Barrels from the camera.
[09:38.32]I saw that already.
[09:39.08]Okay.
[09:41.96]Still have to do that.
[09:43.93]Column from the library.
[09:45.73]I think I did that already, didn't I?
[09:47.67]It was this thing, right?
[09:49.83]Still have to do that.
[09:50.79]I guess not.
[09:52.53]I think that's it.
[09:54.43]Follow the instructions on the flower note.
[09:56.75]Haven't done that.
[09:58.41]Flower note.
[09:59.11]I have a flower right here.
[10:06.85]Flower note.
[10:07.69]Oh God.
[10:09.33]Flower is a joy when it thrives, a burden when death arrives.
[10:13.11]Gather your dried petals where immortality resides.
[10:17.81]Place a flower where she stands.
[10:22.04]Before the stone turns to dust, she will tell you what she can away and back to earn her trust.
[10:30.06]This is a flower.
[10:33.73]okay so where's that is that I'm in okay this is where the barrel is right it has to be right right has to be right barrels in here right oh wait oh my god what is that I have a picture of this can you zoom in what do I do with that
[11:03.32]Alright, something has to depress that.
[11:05.76]Do I have anything to depress it?
[11:14.07]Hmm.
[11:15.51]I don't think I have whatever it is yet.
[11:18.41]Wait, I have a larger inventory.
[11:19.81]Okay, well, where's the barrel?
[11:24.82]Is the barrel in here too?
[11:25.62]I don't think there's a barrel in here.
[11:29.98]I already did this.
[11:30.62]I got made fun of for that a lot.
[11:43.71]Okay, wait, wait, wait, what did it say?
[11:47.35]Place a flower where she stands.
[11:51.09]It's not the statue, right?
[11:52.23]I mean that this thing is a statue here.
[11:56.40]Place a flower where she stands.
[12:01.41]No?
[12:03.61]Okay, I just did it.
[12:04.35]I got it.
[12:04.59]I got it.
[12:04.79]What do I do?
[12:05.27]What do I do?
[12:21.70]I want to get in front of the statue.
[12:23.52]What the hell are you doing?
[12:24.38]What happened?
[12:28.15]What happened?
[12:31.87]Is it quiet?
[12:32.47]Hold on, I can turn it up.
[12:33.25]There you go.
[12:37.73]Uh, so what does that even do?
[12:38.69]I got just so much shit to do.
[12:53.44]Find a flower.
[12:54.26]I just gave the, I just put a rose here.
[13:00.28]Can't check that off yet.
[13:02.40]Okay, what are the instructions?
[13:05.04]Place a flower where she stands before the stone turns to dust.
[13:10.64]She will tell you what she can.
[13:13.54]Wait.
[13:22.26]She's not saying anything.
[13:33.54]Leave and come back, maybe?
[13:42.24]That didn't do anything.
[13:44.87]Use here.
[13:49.39]Before the stone turns to dust.
[13:56.57]Should I, um... Should I just open up the guide and type in control F flower?
[14:06.35]You know, I'm whatever I don't.
[14:08.15]I'm I'm ready to do that.
[14:10.47]That's cheating.
[14:11.23]Whatever I didn't cheat for the first seven episodes.
[14:19.96]She stands before the stone.
[14:21.90]It's like a one of the staircases.
[14:29.88]I can't seem to interact with anything.
[14:33.14]She will tell you what to do.
[14:46.19]You can't just skip an episode?
[14:52.32]Well, maybe I have to do something else.
[14:56.96]Hold on.
[14:58.20]Check the graves, maybe?
[15:04.61]Church the property for a dried flower.
[15:06.95]I just got it!
[15:07.65]I just handed it to her!
[15:16.82]Am I softlocked?
[15:17.46]Did the game break?
[15:23.61]I need to go get more flowers?
[15:25.23]Alright, well, whatever.
[15:34.47]Sounds like Addison and Jessalyn dropped something.
[15:36.74]See if you can locate it.
[15:41.38]I already got it, okay.
[15:42.93]Find the window mentioned in the recording.
[15:44.83]Did I do that?
[15:46.53]Okay, I already found the window.
[15:48.31]I think it was that stained glass in there, right?
[15:51.17]Follow up on the images that were spliced into the movie.
[15:55.99]I haven't seen the episode in a month!
[15:59.53]Find the location that was spliced into the film.
[16:01.61]What film?
[16:15.07]if we were in here- oh my god what do I do?
[16:26.58]am I alright?
[16:34.39]oh shit
[16:44.71]Okay.
[16:45.77]That was weird.
[16:50.83]If I could stack enough things together, I could climb up to that wallpaper.
[16:54.84]Isn't this like some Angry Birds shit?
[16:55.98]I don't want to do this.
[16:56.76]How many items do I have?
[17:21.27]Nancy, you're not going to be able to stand on this.
[17:22.85]Are you kidding me?
[17:32.20]Okay, that's not going to... Wait, hold on.
[17:36.53]I made it.
[17:37.03]I'm right there.
[17:39.30]Okay, that was kind of easy.
[17:42.14]That was really easy.
[17:48.20]I didn't need the guide for that one.
[17:49.44]We're good.
[17:54.26]That was a baby puzzle?
[17:57.67]Okay, how come they're that easy sometimes?
[17:59.27]But before I had to find out the positive and negative neutrons.
[18:04.17]That one was impossible.
[18:08.28]Oh my God, what happened?
[18:09.72]Two handles pull out the box to which the star belongs.
[18:16.44]I can't read that fast.
[18:20.89]No, I can't read that fast.
[18:22.97]The handles pull out the box, the middle is... Whoa, that was close.
[18:30.66]Okay, apparently we're fine.
[18:33.02]Two handles pull out the box to which the star belongs.
[18:39.30]From the middle, it shines, rising above them all.
[18:46.02]What the fuck does that mean?
[18:49.18]Two handles pull out the box.
[18:50.74]Okay, so there's going to be a box.
[18:51.82]I have to pull out two handles.
[18:55.41]And then take a picture of this.
[19:02.37]Oh, I can do it with my phone, right?
[19:07.70]Get the fuck out of the... Put this down.
[19:11.24]Oh my God.
[19:26.76]Okay, I got it.
[19:28.06]Whatever that means.
[19:30.84]Okay, what else is in here?
[19:41.24]It's kind of dark.
[19:41.70]I can't really see.
[19:44.98]I don't think I can do anything else in here.
[19:50.43]Haven't done that.
[19:51.41]Haven't done that.
[19:52.25]Okay, figure out the importance.
[19:53.45]Still have to do that.
[19:54.59]How to open the coffins.
[19:55.65]Still have to do that.
[19:56.79]Find the grave.
[19:57.25]Check.
[19:57.79]Oh, I found Ethel's grave.
[19:59.89]Did that.
[20:00.89]Oh, shit.
[20:01.76]This was part of the movie.
[20:02.92]Okay.
[20:03.94]Check.
[20:04.50]Wait, what was that?
[20:04.96]I didn't even see what it was.
[20:05.70]Find a way to what?
[20:07.44]Haven't done that.
[20:08.74]Follow the instructions.
[20:10.36]Check out the column.
[20:11.10]Alright.
[20:12.00]Check out the barrels.
[20:13.68]Dirt floor.
[20:15.43]Alright.
[20:16.51]We're going pretty well here.
[20:18.11]Alright.
[20:18.33]So I think I got everything.
[20:20.29]I got this new sketch and I got a picture.
[20:23.17]That's good.
[20:24.69]I'll use the ghost meter.
[20:25.55]That's not a bad idea.
[20:31.42]Whoa.
[20:31.82]What do I do about that?
[20:34.64]It's super ghosty in here right now.
[20:36.38]What do I do?
[20:44.65]Okay, well, whatever.
[20:45.69]I think I did everything I can do.
[20:51.12]Wait.
[20:52.26]What's this?
[20:52.64]Does this matter?
[20:59.06]Okay.
[21:06.34]I'm just getting out of here.
[21:10.12]Ooh, what's that?
[21:12.66]There's like a weird puzzle there.
[21:18.08]Pull the levers on the side of the box, right?
[21:22.60]Do I have anything I can put here?
[21:29.89]It's a calculator.
[21:30.67]I definitely can put something there later.
[21:40.29]That's pretty good Dark Souls music.
[21:41.87]It kind of is Dark Souls music, isn't it?
[21:43.23]Alright, what does it want me to do here?
[21:49.17]Right?
[21:49.37]It's like, oh, stand here and look at this.
[21:51.93]But why?
[21:56.88]The window?
[22:01.84]Nancy of the Boreal Valley.
[22:09.09]I could talk to this guy again.
[22:10.63]This guy was kind of a dick though, wasn't he?
[22:12.57]What's up?
[22:14.45]How did you and Jessalyn meet?
[22:16.39]I saw her one day and thought...
[22:18.83]This is the girl I'm gonna marry.
[22:21.15]And then I threw a rock at her face.
[22:24.61]Like, metaphorically?
[22:26.60]No, I was just a kid.
[22:28.90]I had a very limited game book.
[22:31.90]She still has a little scar.
[22:34.36]You can see it when she smiles.
[22:37.40]I'll never live that down.
[22:39.48]I imagine things improved from there?
[22:41.90]We became best friends.
[22:44.04]Then we grew up and became what we are.
[22:47.89]Or were.
[22:49.97]Or.
[22:50.09]Okay.
[22:52.11]Uh.
[22:53.31]So you and Jessalyn must have dated for quite some time.
[22:56.31]I thought I turned the notes.
[22:57.87]Can you tell me anything about these?
[22:59.80]Really?
[23:00.76]We both dated other people, but nothing worked out.
[23:04.44]One day Clara had enough and sat us down and said, everyone knows you're going to get married.
[23:10.20]Go to it already.
[23:11.95]Jess was mortified.
[23:14.55]I took her out to the coast and thought I always cheered her up.
[23:17.56]We talked through the night and by the time the sun came up, it just stopped sounding so silly.
[23:26.84]Aren't you worried that your parents won't approve of Lexi?
[23:30.18]Not after all they've done.
[23:32.18]It's time for them to start worrying about my approval because I am done looking for theirs.
[23:38.99]I better get going later.
[23:49.03]Okay, here's this.
[23:51.85]First of its kind across the bottom.
[23:53.79]Should I take a picture?
[24:05.34]I'm never going to look at these.
[24:07.66]Am I even going to open that?
[24:08.52]Okay, well, I did it.
[24:13.56]Open the coffin.
[24:14.10]Still have to do that.
[24:19.19]That's not the column?
[24:25.27]What?
[24:31.19]The location of the line drawing... Wait, what?
[24:34.43]How is this not the column?
[24:38.79]Oh my god, okay.
[24:45.78]Does that have all these drawings?
[24:52.72]Got to find a way to enter the room.
[24:55.00]Okay.
[24:55.32]I still haven't found Jessalyn yet.
[24:57.20]Okay.
[24:59.56]So, uh, I got to... Wait, I have a snake plate.
[25:02.64]How do I look at this?
[25:05.50]Is that where that went, maybe?
[25:06.47]Hold on.
[25:07.21]I got to go back to that area.
[25:13.41]Can this go here?
[25:14.07]Oh, what?
[25:16.65]Come on.
[25:19.47]Wait, can that go in the crypt?
[25:22.57]I might be able to go in the crypt.
[25:26.51]You got anything for me yet or no?
[25:41.77]Snake plate.
[25:42.27]Ready?
[25:44.49]Where is it?
[25:49.54]What's that thing?
[25:50.02]Okay, snake plate.
[25:52.63]Whoa!
[25:53.31]Alright, what do I do?
[25:59.01]Oh, it's one of these.
[25:59.87]I'm very bad at these.
[26:01.29]Oh, shit.
[26:12.20]Alright, nobody look.
[26:17.00]Start, like, here?
[26:21.10]and then like that and then like that boom bingo boom can I rotate them?
[26:39.31]that was the saddest boom I think I've ever heard oh yeah boom
[26:50.51]Where does this one go then?
[26:52.43]Hold on.
[27:01.07]Where does this one go?
[27:01.85]Do they all have to be placed?
[27:10.30]Is this one bait?
[27:11.54]You can't why didn't tell me I could turn them so I had it right the whole fucking time.
[27:19.95]I thought the whole point was this is like is it maybe it's hard because you can't turn them.
[27:47.88]Here I got it.
[27:49.24]Now what?
[27:58.06]What the hell?
[28:00.55]Haven't done that.
[28:02.35]Haven't done that.
[28:03.65]Still have to do that.
[28:04.67]Haven't done that.
[28:05.57]You tell me this is wrong?
[28:06.59]It was wrong!
[28:22.60]What was wrong with it?
[28:24.50]What?
[28:26.20]Check the camera?
[28:37.90]I don't understand what I did wrong.
[28:47.63]Yeah, this is it.
[28:48.53]It's right here.
[28:49.11]It's I don't I just I literally just did it.
[28:58.06]It was perfect.
[28:59.72]Hold on.
[29:00.82]I don't remember.
[29:01.28]I don't even remember.
[29:02.02]I don't remember what the last I don't remember what I just did.
[29:25.31]Somebody tell me what I'm doing wrong here.
[29:28.91]Oh.
[29:30.41]Wait.
[29:32.69]No.
[29:37.09]I'm confused.
[29:41.90]It's not that either?
[29:46.06]Wrong coffin, baby.
[29:54.50]Alright, I'm taking a picture of this.
[29:58.84]Bird?
[30:04.31]It's writing under the picture.
[30:11.53]First of all, let me... Yep.
[30:18.42]Did that.
[30:23.18]Can't pull this off.
[30:25.97]Are they other notes?
[30:27.93]Oh, maybe that's it.
[30:38.03]Wait.
[30:39.21]What the fuck is going on here?
[30:51.58]Hmm.
[31:01.22]I don't understand this.
[31:02.58]There's a pattern on each of the puzzle pieces.
[31:10.59]Why is this one here?
[31:12.45]Okay, this one's bird.
[31:20.24]Star plate, bird plate.
[31:21.94]Okay, so wait, I have to... Let me hold on.
[31:25.64]I have to go on the right coffin then.
[31:27.36]Let me pull all the plates off.
[31:39.30]Okay, I have the bird plate and I have the star plate.
[31:41.56]So this is the star plate.
[31:44.58]So what was the hint on the bird plate, for instance?
[31:52.85]First of its kind.
[31:53.61]Oh, alright.
[31:54.87]Okay, okay, okay.
[31:55.39]Hold on.
[31:56.97]What did this one say?
[31:58.67]Two handles pull out the box to which the star belongs.
[32:02.45]From the middle, it shines.
[32:04.55]Alright, the middle one.
[32:06.87]One of these two?
[32:11.28]Two arms?
[32:12.40]Okay, so it has two arms.
[32:13.94]It's this one here.
[32:18.53]Okay.
[32:19.43]Bingo.
[32:19.75]Let's go.
[32:21.91]Uh, I just have to copy this now.
[32:27.71]Big, big.
[32:34.14]Okay, and then... Uh, little, little square.
[32:46.67]And then flip it.
[32:50.37]Bingo.
[32:52.84]That's done.
[32:55.02]Alright, what about the bird?
[32:58.54]Bird plate.
[32:59.26]Did I get a message with the bird?
[33:00.77]I don't think I took a picture of the bird.
[33:02.23]I don't remember.
[33:02.69]It was a month ago.
[33:28.31]I don't think that was right.
[33:32.40]I think you have to do them all.
[33:34.50]And then it'll unlock whatever it is.
[33:36.64]But do I press the button now?
[33:37.64]Do I have to put something in the middle of the puzzle?
[33:47.01]I don't think so.
[33:47.97]I don't get it.
[33:51.63]It's definitely this one.
[33:52.51]The middle and the two handles.
[33:54.29]And in the middle.
[33:55.33]It's that one.
[33:57.13]That star plate is wrong.
[34:02.06]Read the riddle again.
[34:11.32]Two handles pull out the box to which the star belongs, okay?
[34:15.25]From the middle it shines, rising above them all.
[34:20.03]It's not this one, is it?
[34:29.87]Let's watch it be this one.
[34:31.85]From the middle.
[34:34.43]Give me this shit back.
[34:47.42]What kind of fucking goofball makes this?
[34:52.00]I mean, I get it, man.
[34:53.04]All this to like, all this to hide your cryptocurrency wallet.
[34:55.58]I get it.
[34:55.92]But like, I mean, it's hard for you to even get this.
[35:04.82]I did it!
[35:05.12]So what do I do?
[35:17.21]Is that it?
[35:30.15]What do I have to put a hat on him?
[35:32.03]What was that for?
[35:35.94]Oh.
[35:36.70]Okay, I have a locket now.
[35:41.26]So what about this one?
[35:42.56]I have the snake.
[35:43.60]So the snake one was... What did it say?
[35:50.31]First of its kind, across the bottom.
[35:53.51]First of its kind, across the bottom.
[35:56.61]Is this one.
[35:58.23]That's the snake plate.
[36:03.02]Oh, shit.
[36:05.06]OK.
[36:11.41]People are going to get make fun of me for these, but that's I don't care.
[36:13.99]It's I'll do it eventually.
[36:40.12]Is that not it?
[36:44.88]It's all the way across?
[36:46.34]How is it?
[36:47.06]No, I should've took a picture of it.
[36:48.46]I forgot it.
[36:48.94]Give me that.
[36:54.18]First of its kind across the bottom.
[36:57.44]Like that?
[37:01.30]First of its kind across the bottom.
[37:08.82]I mean, these are all unique.
[37:11.76]This one is unique.
[37:12.46]This one's unique.
[37:13.10]This one's unique.
[37:13.80]They're all unique to each other.
[37:14.60]It's not like there's one that's different than the other ones.
[37:18.18]The first shape.
[37:21.04]Is it?
[37:21.38]I don't know.
[37:22.90]This one probably, like, this one's made of different material.
[37:26.76]Whatever.
[37:27.06]I gotta do that again.
[37:27.81]I forgot everything about it.
[37:30.45]I actually just, I don't even know how to do it now.
[37:31.89]I forgot everything.
[37:43.77]Bingo.
[37:44.09]Alright, nice.
[37:45.51]What's that?
[37:46.89]Paperclip?
[37:50.45]Got the key.
[37:52.91]Boom.
[37:54.91]Key to where?
[37:57.59]Alright, I got another one to do.
[37:58.53]I got the bird.
[37:59.43]I don't know anything about the bird though.
[38:02.35]This is what happens when you don't write shit down seven episodes ago.
[38:06.19]I don't know.
[38:06.59]I don't know where this bird picture even is, but I wrote it down.
[38:10.28]And I didn't take a picture of it.
[38:24.38]Buried with the precious half piece of key.
[38:26.92]Yeah.
[38:29.24]Just guess for the bird.
[38:30.26]This is not going to happen.
[38:33.03]Might be in the journal.
[38:34.29]Oh, it actually might be.
[38:38.51]I found a message written on the wall in the ruins.
[38:40.59]The name Burgar was spelled out in stained glass.
[38:43.13]I found a reel of film in the recordings.
[38:44.67]I found a camera.
[38:47.33]Looking for bird.
[38:48.19]Birds?
[38:49.51]I found a bird.
[38:50.31]I looked at a bird.
[38:57.65]Snake image.
[38:58.41]Found a message.
[39:01.17]Yeah.
[39:01.61]A reel of film.
[39:09.03]If I track down the locations where the tracks were recorded... I could use the key, right?
[39:15.56]The key is to open the door.
[39:17.18]Isn't that the door I've been trying to get into this whole time?
[39:24.02]I didn't ever find the bird clue.
[39:28.91]Okay, the crypt is done.
[39:33.35]I did the snake.
[39:35.27]I did the... coffins.
[39:36.19]Okay, that's the bird.
[39:36.95]That's the star.
[39:37.95]Okay... Oh, look, I'm getting kind of close.
[39:42.61]Let me see if this works on the door in the house.
[40:09.12]because if it works on the door then that's um and that will be great actually uh oh going up I just got the room just got bigger
[40:42.07]I got the key.
[40:49.94]Uh, I... There is a thing outside.
[41:03.03]Hold on.
[41:04.01]I need to go take a picture of it, don't I?
[41:05.89]Did I take a picture of it?
[41:07.21]I think I already did.
[41:13.23]I didn't.
[41:13.67]Alright.
[41:14.03]It's the place where the house is.
[41:15.81]This is a minefield.
[41:20.75]I know, honestly.
[41:24.03]Usually she leaves notes.
[41:25.01]Oh.
[41:26.65]We are secrets.
[41:27.85]We are lies.
[41:29.05]Through the walls, fix your eyes.
[41:31.77]Up the tunnels you must seek.
[41:33.38]The hidden ways he does sneak.
[41:35.72]Make haste, doomed girl.
[41:37.88]Do not delay.
[41:38.94]Something, something, something, or he'll get away.
[41:43.27]something something something okay we are lies fix your eyes you must seek he does sneak don't delay he'll get away through the walls fix your eyes
[42:05.99]Ghost Thornton Hall.
[42:07.67]Uh, good luck.
[42:08.87]Nancy, here's some of my old paperwork from when I was looking into Charlotte myself.
[42:12.25]I know you're going to be looking for Jessalyn during the day, but night is the best time to investigate the family.
[42:17.35]That's when the spirits get restless.
[42:22.69]I am not reading all that.
[42:23.52]Alright, let me go back and take a look at that thing.
[42:28.26]Yeah, real eyes, real eyes, real eyes.
[42:36.32]I think that was a stream title like six years ago.
[42:41.54]Okay.
[42:42.74]So there is a picture of that thing here.
[42:53.67]Right there.
[42:55.45]So what, what are you?
[42:58.29]I don't get it though.
[43:02.66]Why would that be here?
[43:04.00]Should I get a zoom in on it?
[43:15.23]I don't think that helps me at all.
[43:17.57]We did this puzzle already.
[43:18.69]I did this one already?
[43:28.87]We did that.
[43:29.72]What did I get for it?
[43:31.36]And why does it want me to do it again?
[43:35.74]It was the plus minus thing?
[43:38.74]Yeah, but in the house here, there's...
[43:42.21]that I just unlock the door and is, oh, hey, you're going to do that.
[43:45.31]What do you mean find something that explains this?
[44:01.56]Throw the tiles at it?
[44:02.54]Do I have any other items?
[44:08.38]You chose the wrong save file.
[44:12.99]Okay, well.
[44:18.01]Follow the directions in the note and try to discover who is sneaking around.
[44:26.45]Through the walls.
[44:28.27]Is there like a way I could go through a wall?
[44:29.75]I don't know.
[44:43.89]Should I just control F?
[44:47.43]What do you guys think?
[44:49.09]Control F spy?
[44:55.68]No.
[44:56.28]I saw one no.
[44:57.20]I saw two yeses.
[44:58.06]I don't know.
[44:58.48]That's split.
[45:13.48]No, no.
[45:14.08]Alright.
[45:15.14]If I have too much trouble, I will, but I think I'm doing fine.
[45:26.55]I've actually made a lot of progress in 30, 40 minutes.
[45:32.35]Isn't there a hole in the wall somewhere?
[45:35.53]There's a wall I was looking at and there's a big hole in it.
[45:37.73]I think it was in the house.
[45:45.99]Let me talk to this guy.
[45:46.63]Hold on.
[45:46.81]Do you have anything new?
[45:47.93]Got a lot of dialogue to go over.
[45:52.13]What?
[46:13.49]I already did this.
[46:14.82]Okay, please, please, please never let this fall into the wrong hands.
[46:25.59]If you find this and do not know what it is, please, I'm begging you to put it back and hide it well.
[46:31.17]If you know who I am, then this will help you understand what I did.
[46:35.24]Arrange the color pairs.
[46:37.08]orange and blue numbers along the sides indicate how many of that color are in the corresponding row or column this is important two squares of the same color can't be directly next to each other use the xx to mark pairs you know contain neither color this will I already did this did Clara get along with Charlotte and harper when I had so much trouble with that they all got along famously until the night of the fire
[47:06.23]Wrong save.
[47:06.65]Okay.
[47:06.89]You said you were researching the family.
[47:08.63]Why?
[47:36.26]I might have to do that again, honestly.
[47:37.94]I don't know.
[47:38.28]Maybe you're not.
[47:38.74]Maybe you're right.
[48:04.52]What happened to Charlotte and Harper's parents?
[48:06.86]I want some more clues.
[48:07.70]Someone's going to hand me a piece of paper that tells me what to do with that door.
[48:11.44]Bad blood brings bad luck.
[48:17.00]I saw the ghost.
[48:18.54]You did?
[48:20.00]You don't look near as bad as most who see her.
[48:25.28]That's nice to know, but she terrified me.
[48:28.64]She terrifies everybody.
[48:34.53]I swear, Harper was there.
[48:36.17]I told you.
[48:38.69]Life don't play by the rules here.
[48:41.71]Anyways, if she was, she ain't now.
[48:45.35]What did you mean about the family being split in two?
[48:48.51]You wouldn't know by looking around here.
[48:50.95]Seeing the state we're in.
[48:52.43]But we're loaded.
[48:53.89]What's that have to do with anything?
[48:55.75]The Thornton family bought his money with blood.
[48:59.57]And not always our own.
[49:01.61]And you think one part of the family have more to do with this than the other?
[49:05.45]I don't speak ill of the dead.
[49:07.51]Especially not when they're staring up at the soles of my boots.
[49:11.84]Look around.
[49:13.32]You'll see.
[49:16.82]Can I listen to more recordings?
[49:19.14]Sure.
[49:25.82]When did the factory accident happen?
[49:28.30]That was more than a hundred years ago, and we still can't move on.
[49:32.62]That's why this house still stands, I think.
[49:35.24]Until we Fortins decide who we're gonna be, we're stuck on this island.
[49:41.09]You should see it on a summer day when the ocean and the sky are sharing the same blue, and the grass is bright.
[49:47.71]But here it is, gray and dark, under all the misery we've heaped upon it.
[49:55.12]Um, you don't seem like a bad guy.
[49:56.46]Can you tell me why you ended up in jail?
[49:57.90]You don't seem like a bad guy.
[49:59.84]Can you tell me why you ended up in jail?
[50:02.46]You really want to know?
[50:04.47]I do.
[50:05.27]Then listen.
[50:06.95]I don't care if you believe me, but keep this to yourself.
[50:10.71]Okay.
[50:11.73]I wasn't close to the company then.
[50:13.61]Still ain't, but I heard through a friend of the guy down the way.
[50:18.20]You know how it goes.
[50:19.74]I heard that our processing plant in town was up to its old tricks.
[50:23.88]Hiring people who couldn't afford to quit and treating them beyond bad.
[50:29.19]Locking them in to meet quotas and such.
[50:31.99]I asked Clara.
[50:33.65]She denied, naturally.
[50:35.58]But it made her so mad I asked.
[50:38.52]I had to go check it out myself.
[50:40.77]I went in the middle of the night, and right away I saw it was true.
[50:45.29]The exit was padlocked, right in plain view of the world, and no one cared.
[50:50.77]I broke in, that's true.
[50:52.71]I was furious.
[50:54.09]I broke one of the big machines, that's true too.
[50:56.77]So there it is.
[50:58.34]I stood up, and boy did I get knocked down.
[51:01.96]You must be pretty mad at Clara.
[51:04.08]You don't even know the half of it.
[51:08.63]Okay.
[51:09.61]Well, we got everything I think I could get out of this guy.
[51:15.51]I still need to figure out what is going on with this.
[51:18.65]Well, I don't even know what I just did.
[51:22.25]What the fuck just happened?
[51:24.72]Flower sketch.
[51:31.56]What?
[51:32.90]Okay, so, but, hold on.
[51:35.04]Is the clue here?
[51:39.63]This plaque honors those who found their final rest beyond the family ground, including one across from the bottom and two down.
[51:50.64]Where she stands.
[51:58.89]What's the flower note?
[52:03.14]She said what she can away and back from the left side.
[52:06.82]It tells you the coffin.
[52:07.48]Use here.
[52:07.74]Is that the left most coffin?
[52:40.24]Oh, shit.
[52:40.68]No, we're not taking a break yet.
[52:42.64]I'll snooze it.
[52:44.48]Uh, before the... Is it the leftmost coffin?
[52:56.15]I'll try... Okay, well, now that I have... Do I have the plate for that, though?
[53:00.95]I don't have the flower plate.
[53:03.55]So where do I get the flower plate from?
[53:05.03]You snooze, you lose.
[53:12.04]You have to place a flower.
[53:12.92]I already did.
[53:13.40]I had a rose and it went... And she apparently took it.
[53:19.21]Okay, what about the tiles?
[53:25.00]Hold on.
[53:25.98]Bird design.
[53:26.72]Find a way to use the flower design.
[53:51.91]I'm just gonna- I don't have the plate.
[53:53.89]I need a flower plate.
[54:00.35]I have the bird- I didn't get the bird clue.
[54:17.82]I need to go to that dirt patch.
[54:25.90]Where's the dirt patch?
[54:30.17]Should go to go to Jessalyn's grave.
[54:33.35]Where is Jessalyn's grave?
[54:36.85]Charlotte.
[54:40.57]They're, uh... Whoa!
[54:48.55]What?
[54:49.99]Okay, purple.
[54:51.44]Oh, shit.
[54:52.18]Hold on.
[55:02.26]So, it's purple, green, blue, teal.
[55:06.59]What do I have to do with that, though?
[55:12.31]What does that mean?
[55:21.96]Beauregard Thornton.
[55:31.61]I don't get it.
[55:32.31]I don't get it.
[55:45.52]At least I know the solution to it, but I don't know where it goes.
[55:50.24]What have I not seen on the camera?
[55:53.22]That's done.
[55:53.76]Okay, apparently I did the flower.
[55:55.22]No, that's done.
[56:01.81]Can't do that yet.
[56:03.23]Unlock the door in the tunnels.
[56:04.91]Can't check that off yet.
[56:06.31]No, then I used the key already for the door.
[56:09.37]Check out the barrels from the ca- okay.
[56:10.99]Can't check that off yet.
[56:11.99]Where are these barrels?
[56:15.68]Where the hell is this?
[56:16.44]Down in the mines or something?
[56:18.38]Like, where is that?
[56:20.86]How do I get down there?
[56:21.66]Didn't it collapse?
[56:25.54]I thought that tunnel collapsed.
[56:33.07]In the basement?
[56:33.97]Wait.
[56:38.77]Wait a minute.
[56:42.01]Wait a minute!
[57:01.59]Where are those barrels?
[57:11.20]Barrels.
[57:11.74]Got it.
[57:12.88]What did that do?
[57:18.34]Oh shit.
[57:27.47]Sounds like someone's out there.
[57:29.27]I should take a look.
[57:32.05]I know it was him.
[57:33.34]He dropped a giant key.
[57:50.16]Oh, hold on.
[57:50.92]Whoops, let me drop my bumbling iron key on the ground.
[57:53.80]That weighs probably a full pound.
[57:57.35]Antique key.
[58:00.24]Alright, so I did that.
[58:04.00]See what Wade was up to near Charlotte's bedroom.
[58:06.94]That's done.
[58:07.46]Okay, he dropped a key.
[58:09.07]I'm going to need to find something that will explain this.
[58:19.59]Okay, where does that key go?
[58:22.87]Did that.
[58:23.35]Got the barrels.
[58:24.89]Can't check that off yet.
[58:26.01]I didn't do any of the dirt floor.
[58:28.03]Unlock the door in the tunnels.
[58:29.23]Haven't done that.
[58:31.03]How do I unlock?
[58:37.69]Well, I got an iron key now.
[58:48.66]So where's this door in the tunnels?
[58:50.96]Right here.
[58:52.52]No, what?
[59:02.15]I'm snoozing it again.
[59:03.17]I'm not leaving yet.
[59:05.71]I know I'm supposed to take a break every hour, but we're good.
[59:08.54]I am super engrossed right now.
[59:10.12]I feel like I'm on a roll.
[59:19.44]Alright, here we go.
[59:20.57]Down into the tunnel.
[59:22.11]This is it.
[59:22.51]This is the big one right here.
[59:24.45]Shit.
[59:34.95]I need one.
[59:35.37]I need a number.
[59:41.75]Damn it.
[59:48.65]So what is that for then?
[59:49.63]Are there any of the locked doors I haven't found yet?
[59:54.04]I don't think so.
[60:06.57]Just want to check and make sure I didn't miss anything.
[60:09.66]Right down this way.
[60:10.86]I don't think so.
[60:14.42]No.
[60:17.22]Hmm.
[60:19.32]Alright, well, I... Guys, that was not a ghost.
[60:31.53]That was just a really, really weird piece of mist and steam.
[60:35.63]There's no ghosts here.
[60:38.90]Either that or the edible just kicked in.
[60:40.38]I don't know.
[60:52.08]Alright.
[60:53.38]I need... What else do I... Let me take a look at the tasks here.
[60:57.34]Can't check that off yet.
[60:58.49]Find where to use the flower.
[60:59.97]Directions in the note.
[61:01.15]Okay, I found the person sneaking around.
[61:02.37]I got the key.
[61:05.01]Importance of the name Beauregard.
[61:06.71]Dirt floor from the camera picture.
[61:09.39]Unlock the tunnel.
[61:12.65]Enter the room at the end of the hall.
[61:15.93]So I got to find the importance of the name.
[61:20.58]So somebody will know that, right?
[61:21.70]Maybe I'll talk to some people.
[61:24.36]Isn't there somebody in here?
[61:30.78]Do you know anything about Beauregard?
[61:32.26]Alright, I won't tell anybody.
[61:32.92]Are you the one writing the notes?
[61:55.30]Are you the one writing the notes I keep finding?
[61:58.44]What answer do you want me to say?
[61:59.70]Are you looking for a yes or a no?
[62:01.27]Or the, ah, the in-between one?
[62:03.11]Just the truth.
[62:06.37]Oh, now that I can't help you with.

[62:32.84]After the only family member everyone can agree on has gone missing?
[62:36.82]Is that what you're asking?

[70:27.94]Look at me down here.
[70:29.35]And she's up there.
[70:30.81]I try not to hate her, but I can't help it.
[70:34.31]I'd better get going.
[70:35.19]Is that it?
[70:35.81]Goodbye.
[70:38.57]Can't stay away.
[70:39.64]Okay, well, there's no new info.
[70:44.60]Whatever.
[70:45.20]I'd better get going.
[70:46.68]Goodbye.
[70:54.50]Alright, I gotta find this dirt floor.
[70:56.20]What does a dirt floor look like?
[70:59.14]Alright, what?
[71:05.56]Didn't I?
[71:05.98]Did I do this already?
[71:07.23]I thought I already did this.
[71:09.89]There's a big dirt mound somewhere.
[71:12.05]And then... That photo.
[71:18.11]Where's this big dirt mound?
[71:31.89]I'm not in here, right?
[71:40.07]Here's that movie again.
[71:40.95]Okay, that was just... Huh?
[71:45.97]Okay, well, that was scary.
[71:46.75]The fuck was that?
[72:03.06]There's a mutant from Fallout.
[72:05.35]What was that?
[72:13.35]What actually was that?
[72:14.69]That wasn't a rat.
[72:15.71]That was not a rat.
[72:16.51]Okay, whatever.
[72:24.46]Where is this dirt?
[72:25.50]I do not care if she's an adult.
[72:27.80]She's my daughter.
[72:29.28]I should listen.
[72:30.53]She's not a runaway.
[72:31.59]She'd never do that to us.
[72:35.15]No, no, no.
[72:36.29]It's not cold feet.
[72:39.17]It's not running away.
[72:40.77]Someone took her.
[72:43.87]She is in danger out there.
[72:46.08]Do something.
[72:47.42]She sounds pretty upset.
[72:51.82]Does this mean anything to you?
[72:53.58]Alright, not to be rude, but you don't look so great right now.
[72:56.49]What?
[73:23.06]Colton thinks he was forced into the relationship with Jessalyn.
[73:26.34]Harper really was down there.
[73:27.64]I'm not making things up.
[73:29.58]I saw Charlotte.
[73:31.06]Wade said that you're the reason he went to jail.
[73:33.32]Can you tell me anything about your father?
[73:35.40]These are all incredibly personal questions that I think that you would need to know somebody for at least a couple of years before you asked.
[73:42.91]Right?
[73:43.05]These are all heavy hitting questions.
[73:49.65]Uh, why don't we start with this?
[73:52.39]Harper really was down there.
[73:54.24]I'm not making things up.
[73:55.88]What do you want from me?
[73:57.70]Nothing.
[73:58.12]I want the fucking truth.
[74:00.92]Then no more games now, OK?
[74:03.41]I'm telling the truth.
[74:05.25]Nancy, enough.
[74:06.85]Just go away.
[74:08.07]No, come on.
[74:09.23]Not now.
[74:10.15]Oh, please give me a break.
[74:14.46]You're all such weirdos.
[74:18.12]That was the question that was that threw everything off?
[74:21.16]Now I'm not going to get any clues.
[74:26.35]See, look, I left the room and came back.
[74:28.13]Oh, come on.
[74:28.69]Your AI is at least somewhat brainless.
[74:35.49]Try it again.
[74:37.21]One, two, three, four, five.
[74:42.07]Hey, it's a new day.
[74:45.05]Okay, so not to... I saw Charlotte as well.
[74:49.03]Okay.
[74:49.20]What's the correct thing to keep this going?
[75:14.42]Tell me a little bit about Harper.
[75:15.16]It seems like you two really didn't get along.
[75:17.80]Maybe this one?
[75:18.18]Can you tell me a little about Harper?
[75:19.98]It seems like you two really didn't get along.
[75:22.76]She blamed me for what happened to Charlotte.
[75:24.46]Okay, we're getting somewhere.
[75:25.36]Blamed you?
[75:26.12]On some level, she was convinced it was me.
[75:29.90]I let it go at first.
[75:31.65]She was just torn to shreds about the whole thing.
[75:35.33]But the more time went by, the more disturbed she got.
[75:39.55]She was obsessed with the idea that I had stolen part of Charlotte's locket.
[75:44.61]What kind of locket?
[75:46.23]I never figured out what she was talking about.
[75:49.35]One night, she followed me out onto the widow's walk.
[75:53.56]Hmm...
[76:09.30]Can you tell me anything about your father that might be relevant?
[76:12.86]Why would you ask me about my father?
[76:16.02]Stone unturned, pursue all angles.
[76:18.88]I don't believe you.
[76:20.44]Fine.
[76:21.48]I never knew who my daddy was.
[76:23.42]Happy to hear me say that?
[76:24.98]I promise I didn't know.
[76:26.92]Whatever.
[76:27.82]It doesn't matter.
[76:29.84]Why didn't your mother ever tell you?
[76:32.05]I think one day she was going to tell me.
[76:35.13]But she didn't live to get the chance.
[76:40.46]Colton thinks he was forced into the relationship with Jessalyn.
[76:43.50]You have anything to do with that?
[76:44.28]Forced?
[76:45.31]Please.
[76:46.57]Jessie's a gem.
[76:48.05]Any man be lucky to get the time of day from her.
[76:50.52]Don't tell a soul about this.
[76:52.48]But Colton, he's got problems.
[76:55.31]Nothing big, so don't go jumping to conclusions.
[76:58.55]But his parents told me right away he's always struggled a little.
[77:02.97]He's a smart boy, but these fits of paranoia take hold of him now and again.
[77:07.73]So this is a Twitter conversation?
[77:10.41]He was dating your daughter.
[77:11.83]A mother always worries.
[77:14.31]I'm not saying Colton is crazy.
[77:16.58]I'm saying give him some space.
[77:18.94]He's had his troubles.
[77:25.07]Okay.
[77:27.22]So... We're gonna save that one for last because it's not gonna go well.
[77:32.19]No.
[77:33.23]Wade is the reason Wade went to jail.
[77:35.63]He said you were the one who pressed charges.
[77:38.40]Well, isn't he the chatterbox when it suits him?
[77:41.68]Is that true?
[77:42.84]Yeah, it is.
[77:44.26]What he doesn't get, what no one gets, is that I meant well.
[77:48.37]No matter how he explained it to you, he broke the law.
[77:51.53]He broke into the factory, he damaged thousands of dollars of equipment, and scared the workers half to death.
[77:57.59]I didn't think he'd go to jail, though.
[77:59.88]And he knows that.
[78:01.34]What did you think would happen?
[78:03.22]I thought community service.
[78:05.30]An officer to keep him away from his crooked friends so he would finally straighten up.
[78:10.32]I planned on dropping the charges, but once the ball got rolling, I lost control of it.
[78:15.49]Wade ended up sitting across from a judge who wanted to make an example.
[78:19.59]And that was that.
[78:21.05]Wade has wanted his revenge ever since.
[78:23.89]I even... It's stupid.
[78:26.53]I even suspected him of taking Jessalyn to get back at me.
[78:29.50]But he'd never do something like that.
[78:31.98]I mean, I don't think.
[78:35.34]Here, take this picture of crumpled up drawings of a giraffe, a rhinoceros, a T-Rex, and a baby bottle, and head up to my room and try to figure it out.
[78:51.20]Not to be rude, but you don't look so great right now.
[78:54.64]Headache.
[78:55.82]I think it's the stress.
[78:57.56]Since I got here, I have been feeling really strange.
[79:02.53]I've been holding on to this for 25 years.
[79:04.51]Never knew what the hell it was for.
[79:08.55]Maybe it has something to do with the giraffe, rhinoceros, T-Rex, and baby bottle-shaped indents on the door.
[79:15.33]I don't know, heck, if I could figure it out.
[79:18.17]Darling, you take it and you see what you can do.
[79:22.68]I'd better get going see you later hon that gave us no new info I mean it got maybe a little bit of info I just got an achievement for looking at ghosts did I see a ghost right here can't check haven't can't check still haven't still haven't done that alright we gotta find this place to
[79:53.51]I already did that.
[79:54.67]Ooh.
[79:58.29]What does this even mean?
[79:59.13]Do I get a clue for doing this?
[80:02.24]What is the point of doing this?
[80:03.04]There has to be a reason to do this.
[80:22.23]Alright, I'm now going to do my impression of every single one of you motherfuckers that says you like tea, but you're full of shit.
[80:43.40]I think that's enough of that.
[80:50.81]I need to add some tea first.
[80:54.69]Alright.
[80:55.27]Is there a reason to do?
[80:56.01]Is this just a fun little thing to do?
[80:57.35]There has to be.
[80:58.45]Wait, wait, wait.
[81:03.23]I don't know.
[81:03.77]Maybe eventually.
[81:04.85]I don't.
[81:05.31]Everyone.
[81:05.63]These games are also weirdly connected.
[81:09.00]I need to go outside because I need to find this dirt patch.
[81:14.94]Dirt is outside.
[81:16.02]That's step one.
[81:20.15]Where is this patch of dirt?
[81:26.82]This kind of grass.
[81:32.36]It's a foggy grass.
[81:38.44]This is kind of dirt, kind of.
[81:43.05]This to me, in the cemetery here, this is where the most dirt would be.
[81:46.99]By the way, what were you?
[81:48.23]I just caught, I saw you.
[81:53.03]Clara told me that she never intended for you to go to jail.
[81:57.69]Don't believe that.
[81:59.67]Why not?
[82:00.67]Because it ain't true.
[82:02.84]She used to come visit just to laugh at me through the glass.
[82:07.16]That was the price.
[82:07.88]Maybe in the basement?
[82:08.84]See you later.
[82:12.96]Later.
[82:13.29]Yeah, I'd imagine it'd be here somewhere.
[82:18.81]Doesn't seem like, what is it?
[82:20.27]It's not, it doesn't look like this kind of ground though.
[82:25.13]it's brown dirt brown dirt with green and it looks kind of rocky this is not this is green grass it's not brown dirt that one just moved
[82:57.72]I'm kind of stuck.
[82:59.28]I don't really know.
[82:59.86]Like, what is this locket for?
[83:07.13]Dirt floor.
[83:11.64]Dirt floor in the basement of the house?
[83:24.49]This mansion or the creepy house?
[83:27.97]Let me talk to this guy again.
[83:41.67]Clara mentioned you had some paranoia issues in the past.
[83:45.47]Is that true?
[83:46.73]Happiness has never come easy to me.
[83:49.26]I've had to fight for it.
[83:51.25]That involves seeing a psychiatrist for a bit when I was a kid.
[83:54.45]Clara knows why I went, but still won't let it go.
[83:59.03]Do you know much about Harper?
[84:00.96]I heard she's in some psych hospital or something, but that's all I know.
[84:05.56]I saw her around once in a while when I was a kid, but I don't remember much.
[84:09.44]Did Jessalyn ever say anything about her?
[84:11.74]Just that she seemed scared of her.
[84:13.98]Maybe they had a past, but I don't know.
[84:17.48]Oh, shit, the game is quiet.
[84:18.78]I turned it down.
[84:20.82]Thank you.
[84:46.60]No, it actually is quiet.
[84:47.71]I turned it down.
[84:50.79]Okay.
[84:52.31]Do you know anything about Clara's past?
[84:55.35]No.
[84:56.69]It's funny you ask.
[84:58.33]Why is that?
[84:59.65]I could tell Jess had something to tell me about Clara.
[85:02.89]She'd get so close and just stop dead.
[85:06.57]She never told you anything?
[85:09.06]I know Clara's mom died when she was young.
[85:11.72]And she ended up living with her cousin's family.
[85:14.28]But that's it.
[85:18.01]This is where it was before I went BRB.
[85:21.97]Goodbye.
[85:22.63]No new info from you.
[85:28.72]That was scary.
[85:31.76]Alright, is it in here?
[85:35.14]This looks kind of dirty.
[85:38.63]It's dirty in here, but there's no... I don't know.
[85:51.52]It's down here.
[85:52.50]There's no mound of dirt or anything.
[86:02.02]Is it going to jump on my face?
[86:07.62]You don't go down here and not have it go... Like a... What are the things from Aliens?
[86:31.55]Yeah, I don't... It could be like here.
[86:35.68]But I can't do anything here.
[86:36.90]I did that already.
[86:39.70]It looks like it could be here, but it's not.
[86:48.00]Shit.
[86:56.73]Check under the porch?
[86:59.85]I can't really go under here.
[87:12.21]Back in the basement of the ruins.
[87:23.42]It doesn't look like I can't do anything here.
[87:25.06]I can't go down here.
[87:42.49]no no no I don't think so I think I did everything I can in here
[88:08.08]Yeah, I can't.
[88:08.84]For some reason, I can't go in here.
[88:10.22]There's no way to jump in it or climb.
[88:12.22]I think it collapsed, right?
[88:17.40]I need to go to the basement.
[88:28.11]You have a photo of the coffin.
[88:42.30]Do I have a photo of the coffin?
[88:49.39]Go drink from the fountain?
[88:56.97]To me, this looks like it could be the ground, but there's nothing here to do.
[89:05.74]Hold on, wait.
[89:10.68]Wait.
[89:12.04]Mound.
[89:16.70]This is my gravestone.
[89:17.98]Is there really no mound here?
[89:42.10]Come on.
[89:44.04]What?
[89:55.55]I got another achievement.
[89:56.49]They said something about looking at my own grave.
[90:03.25]Alright.
[90:03.57]Well, there's something else I do here.
[90:06.97]Lock it.
[90:12.49]is this like a frosty the snowman scenario where I bring the rose I bring your locket I bring your hat and then you come to life check the crypt again bird plate bird sketch
[90:42.77]I don't see any birds here.
[90:47.61]Give the locket to Harper.
[90:50.79]Middle first one.
[90:57.94]Is this right?
[91:17.68]Oh, I didn't even see that down there.
[91:19.24]Okay, well.
[91:24.85]Holy shit, it's this one!
[91:25.69]4 3 3 3 2 3 4 3 2 0 3 2 1 2 0 4 4 1 3 3 2 3 2 4 4 0 3 2 4 2 4 2 3 4.
[91:29.49]Cool.
[91:47.26]That's done.
[91:48.75]Alright.
[91:50.37]Maybe this helps with the door?
[91:52.93]Do I have to put these on the thing?
[91:58.35]Flower.
[91:58.91]Okay.
[92:00.41]One of these is the flower.
[92:02.39]And I have the info here.
[92:09.24]Flower is a joy when it's burned and gathered your dry petals.
[92:13.20]Place a flower where she stands before the stone turns to dust.
[92:16.94]Will tell you what she can away and back.
[92:21.49]If you like, look at her back.
[92:30.93]Is something behind the statue?
[92:37.29]Or am I going to stall enough time for one person to write the one that it is in the chat?
[92:46.82]And I'll just say, oh, but wait a minute.
[92:51.04]I think I've maybe got it.
[93:03.05]Wait a second.
[93:03.49]There is, this could be interesting.
[93:05.70]Hold on.
[93:08.13]Is there a bird here?
[93:13.45]Does this mean anything?
[93:23.13]Can I just tear this up and throw it away?
[93:32.47]I guess I have any idea how many times I've done that.
[93:37.58]It's been at least a dozen times.
[93:38.90]OK, so look at the statue.
[93:51.91]I can't go.
[93:52.65]I can't like look at this back of the statue.
[93:58.36]What a cheater.
[93:58.90]OK, I've done that maybe 12 times in 1200 streams, OK?
[94:10.44]The fountain looks like Arthas from Warcraft 3.
[94:12.76]Alright.
[94:24.53]Maybe a little.
[94:29.98]Yeah, that's a sorta.
[94:31.18]That's a sorta moment.
[94:32.44]Alright.
[94:34.82]I got these numbers.
[94:36.26]Maybe I can put them in that thing.
[94:37.44]I'm going to try to do that.
[94:38.30]And then I'm going to give the locket to Harper.
[94:39.70]And then I'm going to
[94:42.73]I'm gonna freak out.
[94:50.00]You gotta go up your ass to the left.
[94:51.36]Alright, let me try that.
[94:54.98]No, I'm saying going to give the locket and then putting the numbers thing in the thing.

[95:08.23]Wrong way.
[95:19.18]Okay, so... What?
[95:21.85]I don't want to do this.
[95:26.81]I'm not doing this again?
[95:27.71]I'm not doing this one again.
[95:34.24]I am just going to cheat on this one.
[95:37.14]I am cheating.
[95:37.84]Let's be totally transparent.
[95:40.42]I am 100% going to cheat and complete this puzzle without doing it.
[95:46.47]There you go.
[95:47.45]I've just told you what I'm going to do.
[95:53.50]why give me this now dude I'm not doing this this one even has okay turn your computer off vaude watchers no cheating you're you're way you gotta bring Holly back for this bring Holly back well here's the thing here's the problem uh I

[96:44.23]I don't like these.
[96:45.89]I don't want to do these.
[96:47.03]I don't like them, okay?
[96:49.74]This is like math problem dog shit where I got to introduce this and you can change that.
[96:54.82]Connect that one to that one.
[96:56.24]I have to have an engineering degree.
[96:57.87]I don't have an engineering degree.
[96:59.23]I've told you guys that, but I've lied.
[97:04.80]Alright, let me, I will get, let's do it with the help of this.
[97:08.12]I will really try to do this.
[97:09.98]I got to remember what the actual goal is.
[97:13.58]Let's thank God we got the note.
[97:17.70]Bro, you are crashing out over Nancy Drew.
[97:19.98]I am perfectly cool and collected right now.
[97:24.76]This game was made for kids and their parents to help them write stuff down.
[97:29.04]This is a game for parents to play the game with their children.
[97:35.33]And it's for adults too.
[97:36.69]It's for teenagers.
[97:37.61]It's for everybody.
[97:38.31]E for everybody.
[97:39.25]It's not E for seven-year-olds.
[97:41.01]It's E for everyone.
[97:44.25]Well, how do I do it?
[97:46.13]Okay.
[97:46.89]Arrange the color parts orange and blue numbers along the sides.
[97:49.72]Indicate how many of that color are in the corresponding row or column.
[97:52.92]Right?
[97:53.20]Exactly.
[97:53.66]Okay.
[97:56.78]Two squares of the same color can't be directly next to each other.
[98:04.99]Let's just go for it.
[98:06.69]Whatever, fuck it.
[98:18.66]Okay.
[98:37.52]Just think of it like Picross.
[98:38.96]Here's the thing.
[98:39.56]Picross is fun and Picross is good.
[98:43.31]This is not fun.
[98:47.25]If this was Picross, I would be so excited about it.
[98:56.50]How am I supposed to do this row?
[99:07.75]okay three of these and then two and then this four
[99:37.17]And then this one is, there's a three, one, two, three.
[99:40.29]And then this one is three, three or three.
[99:48.56]Oh fuck.
[100:09.68]It's too many.
[100:10.38]3, 2.
[100:12.72]Ugh.
[100:16.22]Go by columns is easier.
[100:21.81]I could go by.
[100:22.37]Yeah, I could go by columns.
[100:23.41]You're right.
[100:26.85]If I were to go by.
[100:31.84]I. Okay.
[100:32.66]Why does.
[100:33.36]Nancy Drew games do this shit every time.
[100:36.26]This puzzle.
[100:39.11]They pick the one puzzle that just sucks and they put it in the game like eight times.
[100:55.96]There are no reds in this row.
[100:58.79]The four should be easier.
[101:07.25]Four and four.
[101:15.17]Okay.
[101:21.81]This is also four and four.
[101:22.87]Okay.
[101:45.47]The same colors cannot touch.
[101:46.89]Right.
[101:51.16]Cross out all of column two.
[101:52.66]Are you serious?
[102:05.33]Don't let them touch each other.
[102:06.35]Okay.
[102:09.15]Bottom right.
[102:09.95]We're going to do this together.
[102:11.51]Bottom right is what?
[102:14.64]faking it I'm yeah I'm everyone's giving me answers in the chat room okay because that can only have one red that's right okay so that makes sense I'll do the zero three row alright so this one here wait this one's done block this out
[102:43.65]Is that right?
[102:44.23]That's right.
[102:46.97]It's not cheating if we tell him.
[102:48.37]That's correct.
[102:52.13]Okay, but I don't think I can do that now.
[102:56.88]Bottom right is the same as top left.
[103:00.48]Like that?
[103:04.94]You said top left.
[103:09.91]Wait, what did you say?
[103:10.71]Bottom right is the same as top... So this is wrong.
[103:18.88]Is that person wrong?
[103:23.34]That's one guy.
[103:23.92]Okay.
[103:24.28]One guy.
[103:24.70]Okay.
[103:28.06]Okay.
[103:28.30]See, right now, here's the thing about you viewing this stream.
[103:31.12]That one guy can slump down in his chair and go, oh, shit.
[103:34.72]Oh, my God.
[103:35.28]That was how many people are here?
[103:36.27]Fucking 10,000.
[103:36.75]20.
[103:36.77]How many people?
[103:38.63]Whoa.
[103:39.23]Okay.
[103:39.93]It's not me on camera.
[103:43.11]I have to sit here and get ridiculed for this.
[103:48.23]Block out the horizontal in... Block out the horizontals.
[103:52.43]And then this one's blue.
[103:56.13]I think we're cooking here.
[103:57.17]Yep.
[104:03.46]That's what Twitch streaming is.
[104:06.28]It's a humiliation ritual.
[104:09.10]Alright.
[104:14.02]I don't want to screw this up.
[104:18.30]So looking over a chat, should I glance over another half an inch or so to the solution of the puzzle?
[104:25.03]Or should I stick with what you guys are doing?
[104:26.81]I'll let you guys beat it.
[104:27.59]Alright.
[104:36.71]To be fair, I did this and you guys helped.
[104:40.37]I, I, you do it.
[104:44.09]I wonder if I can do it from here without, without cheating.
[104:50.03]Alright, so there can only be one more in this row.
[104:52.45]So it has to be... No, that's not right.
[104:55.57]Because they can't touch.
[104:56.23]Wait, no.
[105:09.18]Is this one wrong?
[105:14.36]Okay, no, that's correct, right?
[105:15.86]So then I'm actually going to try to do this without actually cheating.
[105:21.84]Three and then four.
[105:24.06]So four.
[105:32.71]Got it.
[105:34.21]Okay.
[105:38.89]Three and then two.
[105:40.68]Oh shit.
[105:44.64]It has to be negative.
[105:59.36]I'm fucking it up.
[106:00.14]I'm messing everything up.
[106:14.73]It's actually kinda close.
[106:23.99]This is really close.
[106:24.73]I just have to change a few of these.
[106:25.87]Hold on.
[106:26.29]Two, three reds.
[106:32.19]Okay, hold on.
[106:35.33]Whoa, I did it.
[106:36.51]I actually didn't even cheat.
[106:37.55]I cheated a little bit.
[106:39.67]I cheated the first five seconds.
[106:40.75]I actually did it.
[106:52.83]Nice, okay.
[106:53.91]That wasn't even that bad.
[106:57.15]What's in here?
[107:03.14]Bunch of clocks.
[107:04.36]Oh, no.
[107:06.46]No, no, no, not today.
[107:09.30]Not today.
[107:10.02]Not after the bong rip I did.
[107:12.28]No, no, no, not after the bong rip I just did.
[107:15.36]No!
[107:22.45]Oh, great.
[107:24.59]It's like my worst nightmare.
[107:27.69]Oh, I have a key.
[107:30.77]No, I don't.
[107:43.80]Oh, OK.
[107:53.89]And what is that for?
[107:54.69]I can't... Why can I not turn them?
[107:58.71]Hold on.
[108:23.76]Trying to do a song.
[108:24.82]Uh, I can't do this yet.
[108:25.52]That's fine.
[108:28.82]Camera?
[108:29.16]Uh, well.
[108:31.52]Okay, hold on.
[108:32.14]What was the... the picture?
[108:35.31]Purple, green, blue, teal.
[108:36.23]Purple, green...
[108:53.17]Purple, green, blue.
[108:56.61]Wait, what?
[109:02.80]Purple, green, blue.
[109:04.74]Can they go through each other?
[109:05.78]Purple, green, blue, teal.
[109:09.25]Purple, green, blue, purple.
[109:15.93]What?
[109:25.32]Can you go diagonal?
[109:26.20]Purple, green.
[109:29.14]Blue, teal.
[109:33.90]Purple, green.
[109:35.26]Purple, purple, green.
[109:38.74]Blue, teal.
[109:42.18]Blue, teal.
[109:44.54]Purple, green.
[109:45.80]No, you stupid idiot.
[109:47.12]I pressed it.
[109:47.68]Fuck.
[109:50.59]Purple, green.
[109:54.72]blue, purple, green, blue, teal, purple, green, blue, teal, purple, green, purple, green, purple, green, purple, green, purple, green, blue, teal.
[110:14.49]What am I?
[110:14.77]What's the goal?
[110:17.03]Purple, green, blue.
[110:18.01]Am I supposed to do them all?
[110:18.95]Or just wait, what do I have to do?
[110:27.42]Have to get to the top, right?
[110:28.30]Top right, top right.
[110:34.92]Goal is to... Top right.
[110:39.18]Oh, fuck.
[110:40.20]Okay, well, I... Wait, come back.
[110:42.98]Okay.
[110:44.96]Purple.
[110:46.94]Should I work backwards?
[110:51.48]Purple, green.
[110:54.92]Purple...
[110:58.55]I can't walk.
[110:59.07]I can't do it backwards.
[111:02.13]So this has to end here.
[111:03.16]I have to end up here.
[111:07.34]Here and here is where I have to end up.
[111:10.44]So either this section.
[111:12.18]Alright.
[111:12.54]I got it.
[111:12.94]I got it.
[111:13.16]I got it.
[111:13.98]I'll get there.
[111:28.20]Purple.
[111:35.18]Sometimes I click and it doesn't do it.
[111:36.96]It's fucking sloppy.
[111:38.16]I have to be really slow.
[111:46.97]Wait, I can go through two of them though.
[111:49.35]You can't go in reverse.
[111:51.85]Unfortunately.
[111:52.39]Okay.
[111:55.55]Let me sit correctly.
[112:03.49]green blue teal shit there's too many colors on the fucking screen I had I got over here before alright you can so you can go through too I did I guess I just figured that out right now
[112:35.73]Was that easy?
[112:36.47]It was that simple?
[112:41.25]I thought I was gonna have to go around everywhere.
[112:43.43]What?
[112:49.94]All the other tiles are just bait.
[112:51.50]Are you serious?
[112:57.07]The passages are no longer safe.
[112:59.39]It becomes necessary to hide them.
[113:02.18]Unlock the clocks and strike 12 on all five together.
[113:13.54]Passages are no longer safe.
[113:14.86]It becomes necessary to hide them.
[113:17.23]Unlock the clocks.
[113:18.37]Have all the clocks strike 12.
[113:20.55]All five together.
[113:21.43]Okay.
[113:26.27]Masquerade ball.
[113:28.12]Charlotte Thornton.
[113:29.16]Sunday at 7 p.m.
[113:30.60]Okay.
[113:32.30]Menu.
[113:33.08]This is gonna... Does this mean anything?
[113:36.44]I don't know, but there's a nice key.
[113:38.36]Okay, I'll take it.
[113:41.04]Sounds good.
[113:43.30]Okay.
[113:52.92]Oh, yeah.
[113:56.61]A bunch of exes.
[113:59.57]I'm worried about her.
[114:01.01]She seemed to always be so close to slipping off the edge and doing something completely crazy.
[114:07.28]Now it's getting worse than ever.
[114:09.48]I wish there was something I could do to help her, but I think it might be too late for that.
[114:15.25]I'm close to finding a way to keep myself safe in the short term.
[114:18.69]My room is locked down and I'm working on getting all of my papers somewhere safe.
[114:25.84]Hopefully this is all in my head.
[114:27.30]It might be some of that good old Thornton family paranoia, but that's never been a problem before.
[114:37.57]I should sometimes, but in case I don't, Franklin's memorial opens the first door.
[114:44.68]Each of the four edges are equal to the plaque's first and seventh numbers side by side.
[114:51.14]Okay.
[114:53.02]Somebody remember this.
[114:59.42]Alright, he did that.
[115:00.14]Put it down.
[115:05.53]Why are you reading like this?
[115:06.77]Because I'm far away from the screen and it's cursive.
[115:16.98]Paintings.
[115:22.20]Take a picture of that.
[115:24.88]Take a picture of that.
[115:42.19]Hey, come here, you.
[115:44.21]Come up here.
[115:45.55]Come over here.
[115:47.61]He's looking at me.
[115:49.57]Hey, come on.
[115:51.17]You wanna come over here?
[115:52.93]What's that?
[115:57.15]Little mini cups?
[116:10.58]I guess I can't do anything with this.
[116:20.35]Alright, clocks.
[116:23.09]Can I do it?
[116:23.55]Can I change the times?
[116:25.04]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[116:26.50]Hold on a second.
[116:28.14]They all have to be midnight.
[116:50.25]I don't know if this is how it's going to work, but let's just see what happens.
[116:53.23]Because if they're all... If I turn them all at the same time, I'll be able to see where they end up.
[116:58.13]Shit, I went by it.
[117:03.37]What's that laughing sound from old Super Nintendo RPGs?
[117:16.84]Alright, they're all going to be... Alright, they're all 12.
[117:19.50]Pull it.
[117:27.81]OK, this one.
[117:30.64]Is.
[117:30.84]4 hours.
[117:32.20]5 hours.
[117:32.60]6 hours.
[117:35.60]7 hours.
[117:36.00]Ada wait, do I have to do something?
[117:54.67]do I have to stop them all on I don't get what's going on here um but it says stop them all on midnight that I don't
[118:21.90]I thought they were going to go a certain amount of hours and then stop.
[118:24.47]But they just go forever.
[118:25.31]Okay.
[118:35.49]I don't... I understand what I'm supposed to do.
[118:39.88]I just... The mechanics of what the fuck is going on, it doesn't make any sense.
[118:52.26]Okay.
[118:58.66]Because I could just put them all and stop them all at midnight.
[119:01.42]Is that what it wants me to stop them at midnight?
[119:12.96]So I have to set them so they'll always cross at midnight together and then press the button like...
[119:20.28]Alright, but this is kind of annoying though.
[119:21.32]Watch this.
[119:22.10]Look at the second clock.
[119:22.74]I'm going to try to stop the minute hand on midnight.
[119:27.72]Look at that bullshit.
[119:29.92]Watch this.
[119:30.36]Ready?
[119:31.38]Midnight.
[119:36.89]Alright.
[119:38.05]So.
[119:41.11]I have to do these like one by one.
[119:42.69]Do these match speeds?
[119:43.57]Some of them match speeds.
[119:48.19]Why did that stop?
[119:48.81]I didn't touch it.
[120:06.01]uh alright so some of these have to be set let's just see what happens when this one gets to midnight forget about the fastest one I want to see when it gets to midnight I I wanted to stop it not what this game sucks okay
[120:34.00]So, let's just say it's midnight here.
[120:35.68]Okay, that's... I gotta move this.
[120:45.52]I... I guess... Well, why does it keep doing that?
[120:50.97]I'm not pressing that a second time.
[120:52.27]Sometimes it just stops.
[120:59.29]I want to see these two line up.
[121:11.39]It stops when they hit midnight.
[121:13.52]Any of them?
[121:27.36]Okay.
[121:30.87]But...
[121:39.04]This needs to be set back three to like, uh... This shit's gonna drive me fucking insane.
[121:54.79]Like that for this one?
[121:57.21]But then this one's off now.
[122:02.47]How can they be puzzles where draw a line from the top left to the top right, and it's just the tiles there, and then, oh, set every clock to hit midnight at the same time?
[122:15.94]I feel bad for your teachers, grown-up.
[122:17.22]I was in school 20 fucking five years ago, okay?
[122:21.39]We did our times tables 30 years ago, guys.
[122:34.48]It's just trial and error.
[122:35.58]It definitely isn't.
[122:36.45]It's like you have to set them all.
[122:40.39]To all one of some of them, but it's just that I've got to count how long it takes to go around.
[122:55.68]If I set them all to midnight, I guess I could see.
[122:57.70]Alright, we have to do trial and error here.
[123:00.76]They're all going to be midnight and I'm going to see where they all are.
[123:04.11]I got it.
[123:04.45]I got it.
[123:04.81]I got it.
[123:05.03]I got it.
[123:05.33]I got everyone.
[123:07.21]Watch this.
[123:07.77]Ready?
[123:07.93]Boom.
[123:11.29]When this ends, then we can just go back and adjust them from there.
[123:17.33]I got it.
[123:17.57]It's already solved.
[123:19.88]And I'm going to get up anyways and spread and move around.
[123:22.08]I'm going to go scream into
[123:40.01]Okay, so the first one to finish always is going to be the second one.
[123:43.54]So where is everything else?
[123:45.92]Okay.
[123:47.56]So, I need to send this one is at six o'clock.
[123:53.60]If it started at midnight, that means it needs to start at six o'clock.
[124:00.59]Because then it'll go around and get to midnight, right?
[124:07.12]This one ended at 3.
[124:08.22]So that would mean... I would need to make this one... So this one stays.
[124:17.70]That one stays.
[124:18.42]This one's 3.
[124:20.48]I need to set this to... 11.
[124:21.80]No, no, no.
[124:26.99]Not 11.
[124:27.17]9?
[124:27.21]No.
[124:27.33]Yes.
[124:27.41]Yes.
[124:39.13]6 is fine.
[124:39.75]9.
[124:40.65]This is it right here.
[124:44.94]I got it.
[124:45.44]I did it.
[124:45.86]Oh shit, this ad's gonna play right now.
[124:47.80]Ads are playing right now.
[124:48.58]Oh shit, I forgot.
[124:49.22]Alright, I'll be right back.
[125:20.86]Somebody said it really was like a TV show, like a television show.
[125:38.15]Alright, I'll be right back.
[125:39.85]Alright, whatever.
[125:40.89]Fuck.
[125:42.17]I set them to happen automatically.
[125:44.03]I'll be back.
[126:09.59]Thank you.
[127:24.99]Thank you.
[128:06.36]Letting Otto up.
[128:08.14]Otto wants to go outside.
[128:10.75]Another two minutes or so.
[128:13.47]Sorry about that.
[128:14.15]I'm glad I actually caught that.
[128:22.46]You panicked as if a wild boar was chasing you.
[128:32.48]Well, I told you guys.
[128:33.80]I want to make sure you know they're coming and they don't just appear out of nowhere.
[128:37.77]And that was about to happen.
[128:39.97]If I didn't scream that, that would have just happened.
[128:42.25]So, I think I got it.
[128:43.47]At least I gave the warning.
[128:44.41]Alright, I'll be back in like two minutes.
[130:07.49]Thank you.
[131:26.33]Thank you.
[132:48.73]Thank you.
[133:19.92]Okay.
[133:21.56]Sorry about that.
[133:23.54]I'll tell you, I was looking to go do some stuff.
[133:28.43]Alright.
[133:28.65]So, ready?
[133:29.13]What the hell was I doing?
[133:31.53]I was doing this.
[133:34.99]So, it was 6 o'clock.
[133:39.15]Turn the volume back up.
[133:42.15]Good.
[133:42.47]Alright.
[133:44.79]Cool.
[133:47.59]So...
[133:52.21]6 o'clock turns into midnight.
[133:53.85]Midnight turns into midnight.
[133:56.35]9 will turn into midnight.
[133:57.33]6 will turn into midnight.
[134:01.48]And then I believe this was... I forget which one this was.
[134:03.84]Was this also a 9?
[134:06.91]Let's find out.
[134:31.46]Um, I think we got it.
[134:33.46]Gonna be close.
[134:41.75]Oh, shit.
[134:42.45]Yes!
[134:46.99]I did it.
[134:47.37]I didn't even need to cheat.
[134:48.19]I didn't even need anybody's help.
[134:50.07]By the way, I saw people putting solutions in the chat and they were wrong.
[134:53.77]They were just messing with me.
[134:57.57]Somebody said one of these was like 11 or 10, 10, 11.
[134:59.51]Oh, yeah?
[135:00.37]Guys, got the wrong solution.
[135:05.84]Alright, what is it?
[135:16.22]Okay.
[135:16.36]It's been a long time since I've done that, right?
[135:23.83]Huh?
[135:30.75]Who dares come to the all-powerful land of Oz?
[135:35.13]Dorothy and... And me, the scarecrow.
[135:37.57]And me, the tin man.
[135:39.81]And I didn't even do different voices.
[135:44.20]Don't make me the bad guy here.
[135:46.60]We agreed on this.
[135:49.48]You said she was no good for him.
[135:51.50]You said that, not me.
[135:56.78]Then take care of it.
[135:58.32]He's not my son yet.
[136:00.26]And if you don't take care of this, he never will be.
[136:03.70]And you know what that means.
[136:07.28]And this is where I just, I start going like, Yes, it is I. It is I. Thornton.
[136:14.23]Thornton.
[136:14.91]Thornton.
[136:15.57]Whatever.
[136:16.19]What's the name of the family?
[136:19.58]It's me.
[136:20.24]Beauregard Thornton.
[136:23.15]You ought to deposit $10,000 into my checking account at this account number.
[136:28.69]And then this was a bad, I couldn't even, I, you know what?
[136:31.45]I'm still a little annoyed.
[136:33.27]I can't even do this one.
[136:38.09]That was started to go somewhere.
[136:39.37]And then I just like, I, I was, I was a little annoyed at the clock still.
[136:43.51]That just, I knew where it wanted to go, but my brain was just like, you know what?
[136:46.88]I don't even want to do this one.
[136:52.42]Yeah, that was a, uh... That was gnarly.
[136:55.16]That was a gnarly one.
[136:56.92]Ow.
[137:02.24]You know... Ow!
[137:03.02]Fuck, that hurt my ears.
[137:08.21]How loud was that?
[137:11.63]You cracking beers?
[137:15.83]I'm drinking... Yeah, I'm drinking a Coors Light right now, guys.
[137:24.06]That wasn't loud at all?
[137:27.02]Well, it was loud for me.
[137:28.00]What the f- That was horrible.
[137:30.26]Okay.
[137:31.76]Uh, just pretend like this- the last 30 to 45 seconds just didn't happen.
[137:36.15]Uh, it started out as a- as a little bit I was doing, and then... Uh, then it just kind of fell apart.
[137:42.07]But anyways.
[137:44.31]Check.
[137:46.63]Still have to do that.
[137:47.89]That's done.
[137:49.78]Did that.
[137:50.82]Got that.
[137:51.56]Did that.
[137:52.20]Got that.
[137:53.12]Can't check that off yet.
[137:54.88]That's done.
[137:55.46]Did that.
[137:57.22]Still have to do that.
[137:57.94]Still the dirt floor.
[138:00.30]Can't check that off yet.
[138:01.78]Did that.
[138:02.36]Got that.
[138:03.38]Haven't done that.
[138:04.10]Alright, but I think this, we're getting close to beating the game here.
[138:08.14]And I missed all that, by the way.
[138:09.42]Okay.
[138:20.39]You drinking acid?
[138:23.43]OK.
[138:26.36]They get an item for this.
[138:27.14]I guess I could go talk to her now.
[138:37.79]He wants to play wow so bad.
[138:39.37]I mean, it's kind of true, but no, I'm good.
[138:59.00]Whoa.
[139:02.49]Nancy.
[139:03.23]I know everything.
[139:05.19]I couldn't help but overhear what you were talking about.
[139:08.17]Oh, you couldn't?
[139:09.59]I find eavesdropping to be rather rude.
[139:12.73]Forget what you heard and consider the subject closed.
[139:21.34]Uh... That was about Colton, right?
[139:23.96]You don't have the context and aren't invited into this conversation.
[139:28.34]Oh, OK, I'll do that right now.
[139:30.58]I'll just leave the room and come back.
[139:31.88]I reset you.
[139:38.76]Not now.
[139:40.46]Can't do that right now.
[139:47.00]234.
[139:51.64]Leave me be.
[139:52.32]Hmm.
[139:57.95]One, two, three, four, five.
[140:03.30]Nancy.
[140:05.44]Are you okay?
[140:06.70]You look a little pale.
[140:08.50]It's getting a little hard to breathe in here.
[140:10.38]I'd better get going.
[140:13.64]Bye.
[140:17.81]There's still a couple of... So, okay.
[140:20.11]I went in the room.
[140:20.93]I leave dropped.
[140:22.97]I have this... I did the key for the...
[140:28.08]I have this locket.
[140:28.84]I have this note.
[140:29.92]I already did this.
[140:30.58]Find the secret in Franklin's memorial.
[140:39.31]Use the flower.
[140:40.15]Check out the odd dirt floor.
[140:41.81]Where is this?
[140:45.55]Something might be buried where the picture was taken.
[140:47.67]Yeah, no shit.
[140:52.91]Find the missing numbered stone.
[141:01.62]Charlotte's notebook.
[141:06.13]I don't even remember what the hell that is or where that is.
[141:09.91]Was that in Charlotte's room?
[141:24.52]Okay.
[141:26.08]What do I do with this?
[141:31.38]I should some... I should remember... Franklin's Memorial opens the first door.
[141:41.90]Where's Franklin's Memorial?
[141:47.12]Would you ever do an IRL, Nancy Drewstream?
[141:53.74]Uh, you're saying like an escape room.
[141:55.10]Um... I wanted to do...
[142:01.44]Wait.
[142:01.64]Okay.
[142:05.18]That was weird.
[142:11.91]I'm going back outside.
[142:16.13]Somebody just said that it's in the tunnels in the house.
[142:20.81]Okay, but this is the tunnels.
[142:23.44]So how do I get there from here?
[142:24.92]Do I have to go up and look up or something?
[142:28.84]Hmm.
[142:35.20]I don't see anything that would get me out of here.
[142:39.92]Speak.
[142:40.67]Oh, the locket.
[142:47.64]Clara said you had a troubled childhood.
[142:49.94]Is that true?
[142:51.05]Troubled?
[142:52.07]No, I was an angel.
[142:54.83]And I must have been quite the genius charmer, too.
[142:58.25]Because one day they shipped me off.
[143:01.09]Straight to the most elite private boarding school on the East Coast.
[143:05.61]At least that's what I believed was happening until we were creeping up the long and whirly black driveway and I caught my first glimpse of the bars on the windows.
[143:16.00]I became the first Thornton to be admitted to the Millicent P. Krauthammer Sanitarium for criminally insane girls and women of good social standing.
[143:25.81]I'm one of the few girls to actually graduate from that program.
[143:29.58]I got got a little diploma that says Harper's no longer a danger to herself or others and everything.
[143:36.66]And just yesterday, the Alumni Association sent me one of them dried macaroni pictures inviting me to speak at a function.
[143:45.57]But as you can see, I am otherwise engaged.
[143:51.62]Clara came to live with you after her mom died.
[143:55.14]Just hand me the note Yeah, we was a regular Tom and Huck to start.
[144:03.95]Where do you live when you're not here?
[144:06.51]Wouldn't you like to know?
[144:08.17]And wouldn't I like to know?
[144:12.11]Why did your family send you away?
[144:14.37]Why don't you ask your beloved Clara?
[144:17.69]I really upset Clara, thanks to you.
[144:20.31]Did she cry?
[144:21.13]And if she And if she did, was it one stoic little tear like she was going for one of them movie awards?
[144:27.53]Or was it a big, snuffly, ugly cry?
[144:30.00]Oh, she's an ugly cry.
[144:31.46]I hate to bring that to the table, but it is the truth.
[144:34.66]You made me upset a woman whose daughter is missing.
[144:37.28]Oh, she's a big girl now.
[144:39.14]The truth shouldn't upset her.
[144:41.10]Don't look at me like that.
[144:43.22]I'm bored down here and she's done worse to me.
[144:48.10]no items I don't think I can hand the locket can I here take here take it I don't want this alright what what is this right what is this for
[145:20.75]And what is that?
[145:21.41]I took a picture of this before.
[145:22.69]I need a I need a number to get in here.
[145:26.98]Where am I gonna- I need a number.
[145:29.94]There's apparently a number somewhere.
[145:36.02]A button.
[145:41.30]I'm gonna call somebody.
[145:42.07]What's up?
[145:50.70]I'd better get going.
[145:51.70]Okay, you don't have any help?
[145:52.92]Alright, later.
[145:59.48]Buried where the picture is, probably.
[146:01.24]Hi, Nancy!
[146:09.09]I just saw a ghost.
[146:11.51]So what are we talking?
[146:12.59]Puppet?
[146:13.39]Mirror tricks?
[146:14.79]No.
[146:15.33]Listen, don't tell anyone else this.
[146:17.85]Stupid ringtone.
[146:18.55]I have no idea what that mound is.
[146:41.43]Apparently people are saying it's under the porch.
[146:43.63]To get to the porch, I need to go through here.
[146:44.95]To get through here I need the number button.
[146:47.19]That doesn't sound like the Nancy I know.
[147:02.40]I know.
[147:02.80]I just need to clear my head.
[147:05.57]There is always a scientific explanation.
[147:07.57]People saying is the walkthrough.
[147:08.77]Ned, you've got to tell her to come home.
[147:12.19]Still got to work on that whisper, Bess.
[147:14.75]Nancy, you're really scaring me.
[147:17.00]Come home.
[147:18.38]I will, just as soon as I can.
[147:28.26]See you later.
[147:28.80]Take care.
[147:31.05]That's a lot of things to ask.
[147:42.94]What is this?
[147:45.10]Charlotte's cryptic obsession with Jackson was indeed grave.
[147:52.70]Was she in search of something lost or lost in the search itself?
[147:55.31]Yeah, yeah.
[147:56.33]Who was this Jackson?
[147:57.51]They say dead men tell no tales.
[147:59.57]That isn't true now, is it?
[148:00.59]That phrase itself came from a man who is now dead and still telling tales and letting his thoughts go traveling through humanity like hitchhikers patiently waiting to get the next town.
[148:12.02]Okay.
[148:15.46]Alright.
[148:18.58]Give me something to dig with or a button.
[148:28.61]Anything?
[148:28.97]And like, what is this?
[148:32.89]Did I do this already?
[148:48.64]Nothing here.
[148:56.49]Whatever this contraption is... Okay, I have to find a way to get this bird.
[149:06.43]I missed a bird clue.
[149:08.82]So we gotta go figure out that.
[149:09.84]That's important.
[149:10.62]I should probably know that by now, right?
[149:16.54]That bird clue... Did I look at the painting?
[149:23.96]I think I did already, right?
[149:31.00]There's definitely enough info to... I mean, I might even just trial buy area the damn thing.
[149:34.79]Honestly.
[149:48.32]Okay.
[149:58.76]flower sketch place flower where she stands before the stone turns to dust she will tell you what she can away and back to earn her trust I don't have the plate this shit doesn't make any sense
[150:34.60]Yeah, I'm talking about the flower one.
[150:40.40]I don't get it.
[150:44.83]I'm so close.
[150:45.57]I have literally four little things left to do.
[150:47.51]There's maybe an hour left in Nancy Drew.
[150:55.53]I thought I had maybe an hour or two.
[151:06.16]Check the picture.
[151:06.90]That's there.
[151:13.74]That's there.
[151:14.66]I think I already did all these besides that dirt one.
[151:29.77]I got no pictures of any of any flowers.
[151:32.98]Is this a flower?
[151:42.01]No, I don't have... I got no clues for the flower.
[151:44.83]I don't have a flower plate.
[151:53.72]Flower sketch, maybe?
[151:56.76]Can you tell me anything about this, please?
[152:04.77]I'm finishing the game today.
[152:05.83]Yeah, that's not... I'm not... Guys, if I stop playing this, there's no way I'm coming back to finish it.
[152:14.86]This must be the plaque Charlotte mentioned in her notes.
[152:37.02]What?
[152:37.14]Wait a minute.
[152:37.88]Can I get a number here?
[153:02.93]I can't just grip this with two hands and shake it violently back and forth to open it.
[153:26.04]I don't know.
[153:29.75]That's done.
[153:31.24]Okay, apparently I figured out the secret of Franklin's Memorial.
[153:33.82]I don't even know what I did.
[153:36.98]I need to find a way to use the flower.
[153:40.54]Check the odd dirt floor, which you can't even get there.
[153:44.10]Find a way to unlock... Where's the telephone?
[153:47.77]I'm ripping a button off the telephone.
[154:01.57]Is there a phone in here?
[154:14.24]Because I have to get... I have to find the button.
[154:18.22]It's some kind of a numbered button.
[154:27.41]I have no idea where it is.
[154:31.47]Mom, 1867, right.
[154:32.97]M, 1867, right?
[154:38.72]The phone picture says where.
[154:55.82]Opens the first door.
[154:59.10]Where is, where is this though?
[155:02.29]Each of the four edges use equal to... But what is this?
[155:06.03]This is... What am I even looking at here?
[155:19.43]Was it the plaque?
[155:21.03]Basement door.
[155:29.05]What the...
[155:52.98]But I can't do this without the button.
[155:55.42]Where's the button?
[155:59.57]I gotta get to the dirt.
[156:00.65]Well, to get to the dirt, I need to get the button.
[156:02.17]To get to the button, I need to... What is going on here?
[156:09.39]This is the only thing I haven't seen.
[156:12.80]And apparently this is under the porch, which is in here.
[156:25.65]What's going on here?
[156:42.20]Check the wine bottles?
[156:44.02]Where are those wine bottles?
[156:47.84]The dirt is not behind the door.
[156:50.92]The flower puzzle links it all, but I don't have the flower plate.
[156:57.06]fucking granny likes get the gum to plug up the sink and then you drain the sink you get the key the key goes into the fucking toaster oven the toaster oven goes and gets the toast pops up and then when you get the toast you go down to the fucking basement in the basement it's a toast shaped door where are those wine bottles
[157:33.51]Solve the grave puzzle?
[157:34.61]I think I already did.
[157:35.43]What do I do?
[157:45.12]All th- okay, all four of these are locked behind something that I don't have.
[157:51.28]It's gonna turn out that there was one pe- like board on the ground that I have to blow the dust off and it's like, oh there's this- there it is!
[158:03.55]Go to the wine bottles in the basement.
[158:05.99]Isn't this basement here?
[158:06.81]Where are they?
[158:07.15]Oh my God.
[158:22.59]OK, go wine bottles.
[158:27.41]There's nothing here.
[158:38.55]The note.
[158:43.32]1867 flower.
[158:44.34]Place a flower before the stone turns dust.
[158:46.08]She will tell you what she can away and back earn her trust.
[159:04.57]Remember, you have free will.
[159:05.75]Remember that.
[159:08.57]Yeah, the free will to just run and put a shoulder into that door and knock it down because it's made out of plywood.
[159:20.50]Like, Nancy, you can't go find a battering ram to just knock the door down.
[159:24.30]It's made out... You could probably just put your head through it.
[159:26.39]I already did this.
[159:39.37]No, that's not right.
[159:50.38]That game just... Oh, that's bad.
[159:54.18]That's actually bad.
[159:54.96]Game just crashed and I didn't... That game has not been saved in like an hour and a half.
[159:57.63]That's it.
[159:57.97]Game over.
[160:02.11]That's bad.
[160:04.31]That's like really bad.
[160:07.35]Holy shit, it's back.
[160:09.45]Oh my God, please.
[160:13.82]Oh.
[160:21.86]OK.
[160:22.12]OK, my computer just kind of hard locked and.
[160:24.56]It looked like it looked like it minimized the game and I couldn't do anything.
[160:31.70]That was actually terrifying.
[160:33.64]Oh my goodness, I was about to be so sad.
[160:37.36]What is this?
[160:37.72]What the fuck?
[160:38.08]Wait, where am I?
[160:42.06]You've got to be kidding me.
[160:44.54]Are you fucking kidding me?
[160:49.51]There's a little sliver that I could go through?
[160:56.53]Are you serious?
[161:00.35]I... How... I've been here before?
[161:07.81]Wait, but I can't even get in here.
[161:09.25]Wait, I have been here before.
[161:10.99]How do I dig?
[161:11.81]I need a shovel.
[161:12.63]Okay, find a shovel.
[161:14.01]Okay, so I need to get a digging tool.
[161:31.86]But where do I get a shovel?
[161:33.12]Find dynamite.
[161:43.41]In the workshop?
[161:47.21]Wait, did I pick the shovel up before?
[161:49.25]It's been a month, but why did it not save?
[161:51.52]Hold on, was it actually the second save file is the one I should have used?
[161:58.60]Wait a minute.
[161:59.54]I think I did.
[162:00.36]Wait, I did.
[162:00.82]I think I did that.
[162:02.82]Did I do that?
[162:07.80]So you mean to tell me the reason why I've been running around like an asshole this whole time is because I already did that and in my brain it was already done.
[162:14.97]So I just... I told you that hours ago.
[162:19.95]Oh my God.
[162:23.83]Okay, well, let me go get... Hold on a second.
[162:26.59]Let's go up here.
[162:27.77]Hold on.
[162:31.71]Let's quickly go this way.
[162:35.59]Uh-huh.
[162:36.58]Where's that, uh, where's that shovel?
[162:38.24]Isn't it, like, right here?
[162:40.66]Where is it?
[162:46.12]Wasn't it right here?
[162:54.86]Guys, give me a hand here.
[162:56.26]Where was the shovel?
[162:57.26]It was, like, right here.
[163:03.96]Is there a shovel just on the ground?
[163:09.00]No, the nails were there.
[163:10.86]Oh, so where is the shovel?
[163:19.84]Is there no shovel just hanging out here?
[163:27.15]Oh my...
[163:34.40]What'd I get?
[163:34.78]Two fucking rat meat?
[163:36.92]How are you... That shit was... That is not a shovel.
[163:40.67]That's a spade.
[163:41.41]That's a... Whatever.
[163:44.25]How would I ever... This is a... That's scary.
[163:46.37]But this... What is this?
[163:47.15]A hidden object game?
[163:48.05]I could complain.
[163:48.75]I don't want to complain.
[163:50.86]That's the shovel I needed to go get?
[163:52.60]Oh my god.
[163:54.84]That's so goofy.
[163:56.00]Whatever.
[163:56.50]I got it.
[163:56.90]And now the game... I'm going to beat the game right now.
[163:59.14]Game over.
[164:04.05]That's so stupid.
[164:05.27]Hey, I wonder what's in here.
[164:12.08]OK, I was going to say no way.
[164:17.22]Uh huh.
[164:18.02]What is Ethel's tombstone?
[164:33.22]Do I have that?
[164:42.44]Where's Ethel's tombstone?
[164:44.92]Oh, I wrote it down.
[164:50.54]It's in the camera.
[164:50.94]Yep, it's in the camera.
[164:51.80]Was that it?
[164:52.08]No.
[165:16.68]Was it the first one?
[165:18.96]Isn't this Boregard's tombstone?
[165:23.37]I think this is Boregard.
[165:29.01]It's the big gray slab.
[165:30.73]Is it in the journal?
[165:51.65]I don't know.
[165:53.35]I gotta go back and look at it.
[165:56.08]At least I know what's going on here now.
[165:57.76]We're close.
[165:58.58]So close.
[166:02.50]Someone just put it in chat.
[166:03.84]Is that correct?
[166:07.32]Is he drunk?
[166:09.53]Guys, this is my... I've had one fucking...
[166:15.69]Bush light right?
[166:22.98]What so I had one Bush light and I can't.
[166:26.51]You get what's wrong?
[166:31.09]Alright, let me see.
[166:32.45]I'm just gonna go look at the grave and I have to do it.
[166:35.84]Can't just have you guys do everything.
[166:45.21]Nice.
[166:45.49]Hey, another Nancy Drew game down.
[166:50.00]Until the next one, right?
[167:03.91]You're 5'8", 130 pounds.
[167:04.47]I'm not 130 pounds.
[167:04.83]You idiot.
[167:05.17]It's this one here, right?
[167:21.09]Hi there.
[167:21.99]No, I don't care about you.
[167:23.93]You did it, probably.
[167:25.59]So, just... I'll see you later.
[167:28.05]Can I listen to more recordings?
[167:30.35]Sure.
[167:37.59]Goodbye.
[167:38.57]Bye.
[167:38.85]Alright, we're looking for Ethel?
[167:44.20]Where's Ethel?
[167:49.30]One of these up here.
[167:51.78]Me.
[167:52.02]54.
[167:55.30]No.
[167:56.76]Where's Ethel?
[168:03.05]Roger.
[168:03.49]No.
[168:03.55]113, 1933.
[168:05.31]Thank you.
[168:30.52]so fast I've got the I've got the scoop I know where it is that's the wrong door ow alright one would you say one reset the whole thing
[168:58.14]1-13, it was 1933.
[168:58.38]1-13, 1933.
[168:58.44]1... 13... 1993.
[168:58.50]Uh-oh.
[169:28.71]So.
[169:59.77]1, 13, 1990, 1933.
[170:09.00]Okay.
[170:09.14]Was it 1933?
[170:25.06]113.
[170:25.10]There it is.
[170:26.12]Got it.
[170:28.86]Bingo.
[170:31.14]Yes!
[170:33.86]Now where does this plate go?
[170:35.01]I think that deserves a nice sip of bush light.
[170:42.09]It's hard not to.
[170:42.63]You have to get more sleep.
[170:51.95]I know.
[170:53.51]I've been feeling a little groggy since I've been here.
[170:56.94]We're here for you.
[170:57.90]Thanks.
[170:58.60]I'd better go.
[170:59.28]I'll talk to you two later.
[171:00.88]Okay.
[171:04.64]This is the end of the game for sure.
[171:07.66]Can't check that off yet.
[171:08.88]Check.
[171:10.80]Did that.
[171:11.84]There are literally three missions left and they're all going to be right now.
[171:14.58]Alright, here we go.
[171:27.14]Hello.
[171:28.90]Is it true Harper was committed?
[171:31.38]What?
[171:32.34]No.
[171:32.98]She went to a boarding school.
[171:34.70]It was compulsory, but it wasn't an asylum.
[171:37.47]Although she was very theatrical about the whole affair.
[171:41.09]Where did you hear that?
[171:42.87]From Harper.
[171:44.33]If Harper is actually here, stay away from her.
[171:48.27]I know all the family secrets.
[171:49.63]That was the achievement I just got.
[171:51.57]See you later.
[171:52.60]Take care.
[171:59.40]Now he's going to figure out which is the right coffin.
[172:02.29]And we've solved the mystery.
[172:04.63]The Thornton Family Bullyguards.
[172:09.69]Whatever their names are.
[172:11.44]I said it backwards.
[172:12.24]Whatever.
[172:18.62]Save the game.
[172:26.15]Got it.
[172:26.63]Okay.
[172:27.99]So, I have the plate now.
[172:33.26]Use here.
[172:33.98]I mean, it's that bird one.
[172:40.60]She will tell you what she can away and back.
[172:45.10]Away and back.
[172:48.64]That one is the bird one.
[172:56.56]Away.
[172:58.20]Back.
[173:04.94]Back.
[173:10.12]It's on here.
[173:17.35]OK, easy.
[173:30.14]That's the easiest one.
[173:30.74]Finally!
[173:31.96]Let's close this up.
[173:33.68]Alright, let's get that door open.
[173:34.86]It's time.
[173:35.28]This was in the basement, right?
[174:06.00]All those iPad games finally paid off.
[174:09.91]Not really.
[174:13.81]You don't have to challenge yourself with iPad games anymore.
[174:17.93]You can just spend like $4 and get the bomb that blows up the whole screen and gives you like 10,000 points.
[174:28.24]Okay.
[174:30.04]Now this note.
[174:32.59]Where is it?
[174:40.70]Franklin's Memorial opens the first door.
[174:42.84]Each of the four edges used are equal to the plaque's first and seventh numbers side by side.
[174:52.37]First and one, two, three, four, five.
[174:56.79]So what is it?
[174:57.45]Oh boy, what is it asking?
[175:03.49]What is it asking?
[175:10.71]The first number was a one and the seventh number was an eight.
[175:16.44]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[175:23.29]Like that?
[175:24.69]What?
[175:41.92]Is it addition?
[175:42.54]Like 1 and 2 is 3.
[175:43.14]3, 4 is 5.
[175:47.31]5 and 4 is 9.
[175:47.59]9 and 8 is... I don't know.
[176:06.40]One, two, three.
[176:07.66]Well, what direction is up and down though?
[176:09.38]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[176:15.58]Each of the four.
[176:16.14]Okay.
[176:16.60]Each of the four edges equal to the plaques first and seventh numbers side by side.
[176:27.36]Nine.
[176:27.70]So each side has to equal nine.
[176:36.64]Or each side equals 18.
[176:37.74]Okay.
[176:43.19]Corners equal 18.
[176:44.21]18 side by side, not added.
[176:48.47]So top and bottom row.
[176:58.89]Okay, so... This is... So 25 and then...
[177:07.66]I don't know.
[177:10.48]Is that six?
[177:14.34]At 18.
[177:16.60]24 because this one's 25. 912
[177:35.95]Okay.
[178:05.61]That's the corners add up to 18.
[178:10.45]Now what?
[178:14.69]It's like reverse Sudoku.
[178:20.50]That's one guy.
[178:21.24]It's each edge.
[178:22.36]That's what I was thinking.
[178:24.84]Oops.
[178:27.14]Jesus Christ.
[178:27.82]What?
[178:33.68]Each column needs to equal 18.
[178:35.42]Top row added together.
[178:36.52]Vertical row equals 18.
[178:37.34]So each... So everything... Hold on.
[178:44.78]We're cooked?
[178:46.38]I'm not cooked.
[178:47.44]I'm underdone right now.
[178:49.80]I'm pretty raw.
[178:51.88]Each corner has to add to 18.
[179:00.34]you're overthinking it.
[179:01.18]Let me just read this because I'm reading like five people's notes.
[179:03.50]Okay, each of the four edges, this is an edge, this is an edge there, this the edges not corners are equal to the plaques first and seventh numbers side by side.
[179:23.98]So that's so each edge needs to be 18.
[179:26.88]I had it right the first time.
[179:28.56]Okay.
[179:33.03]So this is 15, 16.
[179:33.43]But this would be 18.
[179:34.51]That's 18.
[179:36.09]Then.
[179:36.29]That's 13, 14.
[179:36.47]13.
[179:36.49]Need 5 over here though.
[179:37.23]7, 8, 9, 10 until 13.
[180:03.63]I gotta move some shit around.
[180:05.94]That's 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
[180:06.86]Okay.
[180:07.40]This is 9, 10.
[180:07.84]Oh, hold on.
[180:08.46]9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
[180:08.84]Shit.
[180:09.64]I can't swap these, can I?
[180:18.59]Am I allowed to do that?
[180:38.04]Because didn't it say they have to be in the same spot?
[180:39.78]No, okay.
[180:40.20]I can move them.
[180:40.64]Alright, so there we go.
[180:41.92]So then, now what's the problem here?
[180:43.26]This is 10, 18... Oh, fuck.
[180:48.90]Hold on.
[180:49.31]This is way too high.
[181:02.79]What do you need to do?
[181:03.53]Each edge has to be 18.
[181:04.42]Okay.
[181:10.39]That's seven.
[181:11.03]18.
[181:14.33]Now is this this?
[181:15.69]Did I fuck it up?
[181:16.75]That's still 18.
[181:18.81]That's 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[181:19.23]OK, so what's the problem?
[181:20.53]I need to move these.
[181:42.75]Start from the top.
[181:43.35]Wouldn't it be 17 and not 18 here?
[181:46.29]Do 8, 9, and then 1.
[181:47.01]Okay.
[181:54.04]Then I go... That'd be 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.
[181:55.08]I need the 3.
[182:00.16]Okay.
[182:20.31]First and 8th number have to be 1 and 8.
[182:21.99]That's what I thought too.
[182:25.21]So do I have to?
[182:25.89]Swap the 5 and the 3.
[182:43.71]18, that's 18.
[182:44.55]This is now 5, 6, 7, 15.
[182:51.12]I'm pretty, I am pretty close.
[182:53.46]Stop reading chat.
[182:54.26]We're confusing you.
[182:58.24]I am going to have to get up and move around.
[183:02.56]I'm going to warn you this time that there is an ad break coming and I'm going to get up.
[183:08.89]I'm not going to have it fucking scream in your face this time.
[183:18.60]5, 9, 10, 17, 18, 18.
[183:23.42]Shit.
[183:27.00]He's going to take a game fax break.
[183:34.55]Yeah.
[183:36.45]Oh, I'm going to come back and be like, you know what?
[183:43.07]I thought about it.
[183:48.34]I could definitely get this if I wasn't being so neurotic for no reason.
[183:53.87]Every time somebody tells me to swap a number, I do it.
[183:57.89]So I've just messed the whole thing up.
[184:01.71]The one and the two could be swapped.
[184:06.08]You could write anything.
[184:07.54]You could literally write anything and I'll do it.
[184:10.08]Because I think that you're the one guy that knows how to do it.
[184:12.28]Alright, I'll be right back.
[184:16.90]Actually, I am going to
[184:19.59]Yeah, I'll be right back.
[184:22.23]Have I really been doing this for three hours?
[184:26.05]Alright.
[184:26.31]See you in a minute.
[187:06.20]so
[187:57.34]How we doing?
[187:58.58]Welcome back.
[187:58.98]I grabbed a handful of pumpkin seeds.
[188:06.09]So, excuse me for a moment.
[188:18.58]Okay, let's go.
[188:28.00]Eating like a squirrel?
[188:37.94]Do you live in a health food store?
[188:40.99]Yeah, um, the health food store.
[188:42.21]Has, um, rooibos tea, bush lights, and pumpkin seeds.
[188:47.47]That's all I have.
[188:50.98]I mean, do you really need anything else?
[188:57.91]OK, did somebody in chat?
[188:58.73]I should have left this up so you guys could figure out where I was going.
[189:09.24]The top row is right.
[189:14.46]I'm going to wait.
[189:14.90]This is a 9.
[189:15.76]OK, yeah, that's correct.
[189:19.79]Swap the 9 and the 4.
[189:24.59]No, you're full of shit.
[189:35.01]9 and 10 are in the right position.
[189:48.05]Yeah.
[189:49.29]I mean, I don't know how this one changes.

[191:18.23]I like this.
[191:19.93]Swap the... 5 and the 9?
[191:23.43]Nah, that's not happening.
[191:27.05]I can tell some of these are full of shit.
[191:35.67]Swap the 1 and the 6.

[192:57.75]No, it would be this one.
[193:07.39]Cheating, cheating, cheat, cheat.
[193:09.17]Everybody, let's fucking chant it.
[193:11.29]Cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat.
[193:15.81]Somebody in here.
[193:20.00]Yes?
[193:20.88]You're safe!
[193:21.64]I don't... know who you are.
[193:25.71]Nancy, Wade hired me to help find you.
[193:28.76]Really?
[193:29.94]Wade?
[193:30.72]Yeah, he seemed really worried.
[193:33.34]Oh, man.
[193:34.76]Our family's just a hot mess.
[193:36.28]Doesn't seem like in much distress right now.
[193:37.64]What is wrong with us?
[193:38.78]Nancy, you can't tell anyone you've seen me.
[193:43.35]No one.
[193:44.49]So you did run away.
[193:46.55]No, I can't say what happened.
[193:49.35]And you can't either.
[193:50.83]I can't agree to that.
[193:52.49]I came here to find you.
[193:54.39]Good for you, but I came down here not to be found.
[193:58.71]That's funny.
[193:59.25]She definitely heard me out there.
[194:02.73]Is it the two or the three?
[194:05.07]No, no, no.
[194:05.59]It's not the four.
[194:06.75]I don't know.
[194:09.59]I don't understand.
[194:10.53]She probably thinks I'm a fucking idiot.
[194:18.21]Alright, let me help you or tell me what's happening or I'll tell everyone everything.
[194:22.71]Are we going to go with the blackmail route?
[194:25.27]Tell me everything or I'll tell everybody.
[194:33.75]It would be nice.
[194:34.29]Okay, I'll be nice.
[194:36.09]Let me help you.
[194:37.53]Fine.
[194:38.59]You haven't left me much of a choice.
[194:41.94]You were hiding out in the tunnels because you and Harper are working together?
[194:45.36]Why?
[194:46.56]I didn't come here intending anything more than a good scare.
[194:50.54]Harper found out I was coming and snuck up on me.
[194:54.28]She almost died.
[194:55.85]I had to give her a paper bag for the breathing to calm her down.
[195:01.05]Ha!
[195:06.84]You shouldn't be proud of that.
[195:08.10]Oh, grow up.
[195:09.88]You didn't die.
[195:11.38]I'd been told my whole life that Harper was crazy.
[195:14.26]What a coincidence.
[195:15.70]Me too.
[195:18.68]Ignore her for a second.
[195:19.99]I said Harley Quinn.
[195:21.19]Secrets don't make friends.
[195:23.64]Look, she's not as nuts as she seems.
[195:26.04]That, as they say, is debatable, my dear lamb.
[195:31.21]Stop it.
[195:32.19]She needs to know.
[195:33.78]Leave if you don't want to listen, but it needs to be said.
[195:36.76]I'm sorry, Jessalyn.
[195:39.04]I'll go.
[195:39.84]The night of the fire, Harper was there.
[195:42.82]My whole life, my mother's kept me away from Harper.
[195:45.55]Said it was for my own good.
[195:47.89]I came here looking for Charlotte's ghost.
[195:50.75]But instead, Harper found me.
[195:52.77]She told me that my mother was responsible for Charlotte's death.
[195:56.39]And I stayed to listen.
[195:58.19]I didn't laugh.
[196:00.05]I didn't run away.
[196:00.97]I stayed and listened to every word.
[196:03.85]Because my mother, because she's so cold.
[196:09.20]You know what this is?
[196:21.32]What can I do?
[196:21.72]What can I do to help?
[196:23.24]We've been doing this Harper's way.
[196:25.54]But we're running out of time.
[196:27.14]I need you to get the necklace from my mother's briefcase.
[196:30.29]I'll get Harper to distract her.
[196:32.13]Why?
[196:32.75]What's so special about it?
[196:34.75]Charlotte told Harper to open the locket if anything ever happened to her.
[196:38.71]But if we don't open it the right way, it'll destroy what's inside.
[196:43.14]Here.
[196:43.96]This will help you open the briefcase.
[196:45.97]What is this like bomb defusal kit?
[196:48.19]Oh, I thought it was this.
[196:49.67]She was giving this to me.
[196:50.55]I was going to say, why am I getting this?
[196:54.08]Oh, God.
[196:59.80]If Belle Boyd was a Confederate spy, then turn on two and five.
[197:05.33]If not, then turn on one and six.
[197:07.63]If Charlotte's masquerade ball was on October, oh boy, we had to have paid a lot of attention.
[197:16.44]Okay.
[197:18.46]My mother knows about the locket.
[197:20.92]That's why she never lets the necklace out of her sight.
[197:22.90]It's all in here, isn't it?
[197:23.84]You need to find a way to get it.
[197:25.42]I already have it.
[197:35.41]I own it.
[197:36.05]I have the locket.
[197:40.27]Do you know that Colton is here?
[197:42.69]I don't have time for that right now.
[197:44.81]Please go find the necklace and bring it to me.
[197:49.72]Sorry to bring it up, but were you aware that Colton's seeing someone else?
[197:54.62]I'm not all that surprised, to be perfectly honest.
[197:57.50]You're not?
[197:58.69]No.
[197:59.45]The whole thing was mainly my mother's idea.
[198:02.93]Okay.
[198:04.25]What made you trust Harper?
[198:06.35]I wished I could explain.
[198:07.65]I've been asking myself the same thing.
[198:10.86]My mother had us convinced that Harper was dangerous.
[198:14.62]I think my mother's been putting this whole family under her thumb.
[198:18.36]Me included.
[198:19.77]Eight hours of Nancy Drew?
[198:20.75]To keep us from finding whatever it was Charlotte was about to do.
[198:26.26]Yeah, but this game is six to ten hours.
[198:29.62]Five hours for speedrun, and then like 12 hours for completionist, and seven to eight for casual playthrough.
[198:38.45]We did just fine.
[198:42.33]Alright.
[198:43.23]See you later.
[198:44.00]Let's go open the thing.
[198:44.86]It was nice to meet you.
[198:52.91]And, uh, hold on.
[198:53.77]This was... I at least know that one of these is in here, right?
[198:56.85]Are we serving fried chicken, right?
[198:58.55]What are... If Jessalyn is serving fried chicken at her wedding... It's in here.
[199:06.88]Da-da-da-da-da-da-da... Your groomsmen, no beards, piercings... Uh, no wedding DJ...
[199:16.86]menu uh cucumber tea sandwiches caramelized onions quail eggs chilled strawberries uh no fried chicken so why not fried chicken and cheesy shrimp okay so this is a turn on 14. turn on 14. this is wrong too so this is wrong and this is wrong
[199:47.94]And then Masquerade Ball was... Where was that?
[199:54.79]I wish I could pick it up.
[199:57.08]I didn't take a picture of it.
[200:01.38]Where was that?
[200:02.06]It was the... It was a little card and I looked at it.
[200:16.04]Yes.
[200:17.54]See you later.
[200:18.52]Take care.
[200:19.08]I thought you were going to distract her.
[200:24.49]That's done.
[200:26.23]Did that.
[200:27.63]That's done.
[200:29.09]That's done.
[200:30.63]Haven't done that.
[200:31.99]Can't check that off yet.
[200:35.13]Wait, isn't... Is this it?
[200:39.41]Isn't this the right... Isn't this it?
[200:40.58]Do I just have to talk to her again?
[200:56.35]I don't get it.
[201:01.10]Save it?
[201:01.26]Okay.
[201:01.60]Yeah, Etalyx and I were gonna play WoW.
[201:19.52]Uh, I was just gonna quest for a little while.
[201:21.62]I even told him I was like, hey, I'm probably gonna be a couple hours.
[201:23.48]I'm doing some stuff.
[201:25.04]And then I was gonna quest for like an hour or two alone.
[201:29.03]In like three and a half hours.
[201:37.33]Do you know about Lexi?
[201:39.54]Colton and I were never in love.
[201:41.62]We were in a mess.
[201:43.60]He loved Lexi.
[201:44.62]Oh, absolutely.
[201:45.12]I'm playing a while today.
[201:45.86]He goes back to her.
[201:47.20]But this is double feature.
[201:49.18]Goodbye.
[201:50.14]Bye.
[201:51.56]I gotta level up.
[201:52.20]I gotta get to level 19.
[201:53.28]I get to at least to level 18, 19.
[201:54.48]I gotta level up at least once.
[201:56.73]Okay, find the necklace.
[202:06.23]Sneak into the parlor.
[202:09.14]Am I gonna... Do I have to put my face in the eye thing again?
[202:11.96]Oh, God.
[202:21.88]Please save it.
[202:22.58]I'm saving.
[202:22.94]I'm saving.
[202:27.93]Alright.
[202:29.53]What is going on here?
[202:36.82]Consult the sheet of paper.
[202:37.82]Yeah.
[202:38.06]Alright.
[202:38.36]But how do we get her to leave?
[202:52.89]I don't understand.
[202:53.61]Like, she's supposed to distract her.
[202:55.65]When are you going to do that?
[202:58.18]She didn't tell me when.
[203:01.34]Where was that place where you could go through the eyes?
[203:02.74]Silver, where was it?
[203:21.81]It was upstairs, wasn't it?
[203:27.95]I just don't remember if it's blending together at this point.
[203:34.07]There it is.
[203:35.77]Okay.
[203:37.45]Here we go.
[203:39.98]That's all it took.
[204:06.30]What are you doing?
[204:10.82]What the fuck are you doing?
[204:11.90]I'm trying to help.
[204:23.26]Okay.
[204:23.42]It's time.
[204:29.46]Into the desk.
[204:33.10]Into that briefcase.
[204:34.06]Let's go.
[204:34.96]Alright, the right combination.
[204:36.74]How do I... Press the... I...
[204:56.44]okay if hold on let me get the ones I know so we're not serving fried chicken turn okay turn on 14. that one's on if harper caused a major injuries at the funeral then turn she she did not right
[205:27.55]13.
[205:33.52]Those beeps are loud.
[205:34.34]Uh, sorry about that.
[205:41.18]50.
[205:41.22]I thought it was at 54.
[205:42.32]Was it like 45?
[205:42.66]45, right?
[205:43.59]Wait, wait.
[205:46.85]It was 54.
[205:47.23]Why am I thinking it's 45?
[205:57.56]Turn on 10, which is up here.
[206:07.34]Okay.
[206:07.44]If Cornelia, I don't know this one.
[206:12.64]I feel like it was on 31st.
[206:14.06]I think I remember that three and seven.
[206:28.31]Hellboy was a... Five... One and six.
[206:37.91]That's not a number.
[206:39.85]How do I test it?
[206:47.88]What the fuck?
[206:54.52]Yo, you gotta go fast.
[207:00.26]Alright, it was... Shit, I don't remember.
[207:01.74]2 and 5.
[207:01.86]2, 5.
[207:01.90]On the 31st, 3 and 7.
[207:02.46]1 and 4.
[207:02.98]Turn on 6.
[207:30.95]That's not correct.
[207:38.74]Turn on 10.
[207:39.06]Turn on 14.
[207:44.12]Here.
[207:44.44]13.
[207:45.36]Got it.
[207:47.28]Done.
[207:47.61]Open.
[207:51.81]Open.
[207:52.03]How do I open it?
[208:01.07]It's wrong.
[208:09.70]Do you have to make, is it, wait, is it not as a digits or is it?
[208:12.52]Oh God.
[208:13.06]Hold on.
[208:17.83]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[208:20.83]I guess I don't have information on two or three of these.
[208:24.73]It's F J.
[208:36.51]Got it.
[208:43.70]This must be what Jessalyn was looking for.
[208:49.23]Cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat.
[208:56.87]Got the necklace.
[208:58.17]Anything else in here?
[209:04.64]I gotta get out of... I gotta leave.
[209:06.16]Get out.
[209:06.98]Get out of the room.
[209:07.70]Leave.
[209:15.45]I'm asleep.
[209:15.87]I didn't do anything.
[209:28.65]I got the necklace.
[209:30.11]Let's go.
[209:32.33]Here it is.
[209:34.87]Ah, just one second.
[209:36.41]Hold on here.
[209:37.15]Are we talking about any payment?
[209:41.43]I found the necklace.
[209:44.97]Good.
[209:46.51]Wait, shoot.
[209:47.83]It's missing a front piece.
[209:49.65]I need you to find it as fast as you can.
[209:52.01]It triggers the opening mechanism.
[209:53.97]This necklace was used by spies in the Civil War.
[209:57.14]If you open it without the missing piece, it shreds the message inside.
[210:01.34]I found the locket.
[210:02.94]Here.
[210:06.51]I can't open it.
[210:07.93]I'm going to need your help.
[210:10.07]This looks like it matches one of the notes I found.
[210:12.45]Oy.
[210:12.79]Mom.
[210:12.99]1867.
[210:13.01]Right.
[210:13.19]Um... Mom?
[210:17.21]Mrette?
[210:34.83]Meh... was it just mom's name?
[210:36.73]We have to find an 1867 tombstone.
[210:47.82]Well, that would make sense.
[210:57.16]Yeah, Mariana.
[211:02.34]Yeah, I remember Mariana.
[211:03.56]That makes sense.
[211:04.04]That would be M... A... R... I... A... N... Is it two N's?
[211:28.47]Two N's or one N?
[211:33.58]Mariana.
[211:37.35]Open.
[211:45.19]That didn't work.
[211:49.15]How do I clear it?
[211:50.93]It was two ends?
[211:55.11]Dude, you're high on Mariana right now.
[212:02.75]How do I reset it?
[212:06.85]M, A, R, bum, bum, bum, air, I, N, N, A. Got it.
[212:22.63]Okay.
[212:23.11]Now, oh shit.
[212:25.37]Now what?
[212:28.65]That's part one of apparently three.
[212:30.38]1867.
[212:34.18]Right.
[212:42.13]It's 18... Somebody that... Who died in 1867?
[212:44.19]The two other tombstones?
[213:07.97]A lot of people, probably.
[213:09.50]Yeah, but I mean, in this specific case...
[213:15.76]Who is it?
[213:16.52]I'm just gonna fucking look at the guide.
[213:19.74]I don't give a shit.
[213:31.87]Cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat.
[213:33.49]Okay, if I leave and come back, will this actually... I think I have to solve it right now.
[213:39.59]I can't leave.
[213:40.07]I actually cannot get out of this screen.
[213:49.48]I can't get out of the screen.
[213:54.14]It's going to be right.
[213:55.33]The Wright brothers.
[213:59.27]I can't even look at my phone.
[214:05.63]There's no W though.
[214:13.89]Thornton.
[214:18.61]Yellow note?
[214:20.68]Oh, I didn't even know I had this.
[214:27.48]Miriam?
[214:30.94]Harriet.
[214:32.46]Okay, who died 1867?
[214:32.96]1867.
[214:32.98]1887. 1866?
[214:56.59]Why can I not find anybody on this list?
[214:58.15]Hyrium.
[214:58.35]Oh, they were born in 1867.
[215:02.82]Okay.
[215:02.98]Hyrium.
[215:03.14]H... I... R... I... A...
[215:21.58]Was it Hyrium or Hyrium?
[215:25.66]Alright.
[215:27.26]And then the last clue is right.
[215:37.19]Oh, I want everyone to, I want to put it in slow mode and put it in emote only mode because they got it so wrong.
[215:45.96]They need to put chat into a timeout after that one.
[215:48.80]Look at how they were all just yelling at me.
[215:50.35]They're all talking so much shit.
[215:51.27]Miriam?
[215:53.27]Oh, what an idiot.
[215:54.29]He's so dumb.
[215:57.39]Miriam, you fucking idiot.
[216:01.19]Alright, I'll write.
[216:12.45]What if it just means this one?
[216:15.26]There we go.
[216:18.28]E M E L I N E. Emmeline?
[216:26.86]E M E L R E
[216:45.34]Clear it.
[216:45.80]Clear it.
[216:46.04]Clear it.
[216:46.28]Clear it.
[216:54.24]E... Okay, so it's E-M-E.
[216:56.18]So, boom, boom, boom.
[217:02.79]E-M-E-L-I-L-I-N-E.
[217:16.80]That's it.
[217:17.88]Here you go.
[217:19.94]What's it say?
[217:20.68]I can't.
[217:22.26]I'm going to go see her myself.
[217:25.48]I win.
[217:29.50]Can't check that off.
[217:30.56]Check.
[217:31.94]Check.
[217:33.20]Can't check that.
[217:33.88]Did that.
[217:35.30]That's done.
[217:35.84]Alright.
[217:36.34]So discover the secret of the locket's contents.
[217:39.39]Still have to do that.
[217:40.71]What the hell?
[217:45.69]If I can get this working, it should light up the tunnel.
[217:50.43]Oh, if Jessalyn confronts Clara, things could get dangerous fast.
[217:54.94]Clara can't be trusted.
[217:56.48]Harper needs to know the truth.
[217:57.86]Align the notches to the outside levers, then lock the levers according to the following.
[218:08.40]The motor won't work unless we find a way to move that ball bearing down into the shaft.
[218:49.13]Let's go.
[218:49.47]Oh, oops.
[218:57.46]Wait, what?
[219:01.82]Where does it have to go?
[219:03.14]In here?
[219:03.52]How do I open this back up?
[219:18.52]I had it.
[219:21.17]How would I get it back up, though?
[219:35.00]I fucked up.
[219:35.68]Hold on.
[219:36.42]I'm so confused.
[219:37.04]What the fuck's going on?
[219:40.12]How can I move this back up?
[219:41.38]It just put me back up here.
[219:50.29]How did I do this before?
[219:51.17]I went like down and then right.
[219:55.66]I don't remember how I did this.
[220:02.34]There we go.
[220:07.30]Alright, so then what, what, uh, what?
[220:10.26]I'm confused.
[220:10.94]What happened here?
[220:11.54]Because you come up, I can't...
[220:22.33]Wait, and then go backwards?
[220:31.94]Go up, go up, but yeah, but... How do I get this to move back up again?
[221:25.12]Okay, this is working.
[221:28.09]That's done.
[221:29.37]Can't check that off yet.
[221:31.03]Now that should turn the light on here, right?
[221:36.59]What is that for?
[221:43.25]Save.
[221:43.49]Yep.
[221:48.26]More of these symbols.
[221:49.16]I keep seeing these.
[221:52.30]I've seen two of those already.
[221:55.27]Take a picture of this.
[221:56.09]It's going to be some stupid bullshit.
[221:57.53]You know it is.
[222:01.49]Go back and take a picture of the other one too.
[222:11.89]There was one on the way back.
[222:17.82]I turn around.
[222:20.28]Where is it?
[222:21.32]There it is.
[222:27.36]What?!
[222:28.28]Oh my god, just delete everything.
[222:32.28]Okay.
[222:43.88]Where does this lead?
[222:46.90]Up through here?
[222:50.06]And now what?
[222:56.55]The secrets of the locket.
[222:57.70]There was another one that I missed?
[223:03.38]But what was it?
[223:05.62]What symbol was it?
[223:13.00]Was it clover?
[223:15.38]Butterfly?
[223:15.78]So now what?
[223:25.58]Discover the secret of the locket's contents.
[223:27.46]I guess it's just to talk to people.
[223:34.83]Cemetery, maybe?
[223:35.53]Talk to, um... Where's, where's, uh, Harper?
[223:41.69]Is it nobody here to talk to me?
[223:42.65]Did I call somebody on the phone?
[223:59.20]Nancy, what's happening?
[224:09.33]You know what?
[224:09.99]Goodbye.
[224:10.45]See ya.
[224:11.91]I was going to talk to the guy over here.
[224:28.99]Where is everybody?
[224:34.07]Do I actually have to call somebody on the phone?
[224:35.99]Is that what it is?
[224:38.18]Look, I'll call you back.
[224:43.48]Nancy, what's happening?
[224:45.16]OK, I found I found her.
[224:47.38]I found Jessalyn.
[224:50.00]Hello, that's good news.
[224:53.42]Hooray, she's alive.
[224:55.05]You gotta mention that up front.
[224:57.39]What happened?
[224:58.69]Harper snuck up on her the night she disappeared.
[225:01.71]I knew it.
[225:02.99]No, wait.
[225:03.81]It's not what you think.
[225:05.57]At least, maybe not.
[225:07.27]Harper has always been convinced that Charlotte's death wasn't accidental.
[225:11.35]That Clara was behind it.
[225:13.35]She's been trying to get to Jessalyn for years.
[225:15.95]But Clara had convinced Jessalyn Harper was crazy.
[225:19.45]Which probably wasn't hard.
[225:21.32]When Jessalyn finally heard what Harper had to say, I think part of her knew it might be true.
[225:27.14]even considered that it might be true.
[225:29.48]Yeah, if someone said that about my mom, I'd roll my eyes.
[225:34.36]Do you think it might be true?
[225:36.22]I don't know.
[225:37.26]Jessalyn doesn't seem like she'd be willing to let so many people worry about her unless there was some truth to it.
[225:43.05]Why not just go to the police?
[225:44.83]Charlotte's death was ruled accidental.
[225:47.61]Harper needed Jessalyn's help to gather evidence from Clara or no one would believe her.
[225:52.45]Goodbye.
[225:53.43]Talk to you later.
[225:54.79]What was the last Nancy Drew game I finished?
[226:01.64]Oh, sorry, sorry.
[226:02.60]We finished.
[226:04.58]30 to 40% of the puzzles were done by the chat, so.
[226:15.38]OK.
[226:15.46]Where's the big reveal?
[226:28.17]Did everybody just leave?
[226:44.56]Do I have to hide in the painting?
[226:47.04]What about the porch?
[226:48.80]Is he just not sitting on the porch?
[226:54.12]Okay, well he's here.
[226:54.68]I think it's time I tell you about that thing I forgot.
[226:57.84]The night of the fire.
[226:59.94]I was there.
[227:01.04]I found Charlotte leaving the crypt.
[227:03.76]She was really upset.
[227:05.29]I must have said something to her because she came over to me.
[227:08.63]I could tell she wanted to say something.
[227:11.39]But it was like someone took her voice.
[227:13.49]She gave me this big hug and ran off.
[227:16.15]And she gave me this.
[227:17.47]I think she wants me to give this to you.
[227:20.57]What am I going to do with an unfrosted Pop-Tart?
[227:25.27]You found that in the couch.
[227:27.65]Whose skin is this?
[227:33.14]Dig behind the next symbol in the sequence.
[227:39.61]I wish I had known what to do that night.
[227:42.41]I wish I could have saved her.
[227:43.91]You were just a kid.
[227:45.67]Yeah, and I acted like a kid and ran away.
[227:47.94]And I hid.
[227:49.70]I closed my eyes and wished with all my might that someone would make everything alright again.
[227:55.04]I never told anyone this.
[227:57.42]But I think I saw someone else there.
[228:00.12]The fire wasn't an accident.
[228:02.04]And now, I'm afraid whoever did it took Jess.
[228:07.05]I'd better get going.
[228:08.56]Bye.
[228:09.86]Here it is.
[228:10.38]The giraffe, the rhinoceros, the T-Rex, the baby bottle.
[228:14.07]So let's take a look.
[228:47.04]Whose skull was that?
[228:50.51]I'm just going to dig behind all of them.
[228:51.81]I'm just going to brute force it.
[229:03.99]I don't care.
[229:06.90]What the fuck?
[229:09.62]No!
[229:10.82]Oh, we're fine.
[229:11.54]Alright.
[229:13.48]What about that one?
[229:19.67]Okay.
[229:20.85]What about this one?
[229:24.19]No, not that one.
[229:27.90]What about this one?
[229:32.86]Found it.
[229:33.26]Oh no.
[229:33.92]Okay.
[229:53.08]Align the notches to the outside levers.
[229:57.62]Then lock the levers according to the following.
[230:03.83]What do you mean levers?
[230:08.95]Can I move them?
[230:15.55]Oh shit.
[230:17.71]They need to match up with
[230:22.54]It is a combination slide puzzle.
[230:25.77]And this is not good for me.
[230:29.09]This is not good for me.
[230:58.33]Um, does that make, does that work?
[231:28.60]Or on the bottom.
[231:40.51]Shit, I can't.
[231:41.77]I gotta get them in the right spot first.
[231:44.59]Hold on.
[232:42.61]I hate this.
[232:45.29]Slide puzzles are literally the bane of my entire existence.
[232:47.79]I hate them more than anything.
[232:49.33]More than everything.
[232:57.66]The world's shittiest puzzles are slide puzzles.
[233:00.86]It's just a way to torture humans.
[233:02.60]It was made to torture humanity.
[233:04.44]That's why they were made.
[233:12.78]I think I have to get rid of this one.
[233:22.43]Do it one side at a time.
[233:23.91]That's what I'm trying to do, but I just, my brain cannot do the slide puzzle dog shit.
[233:29.55]I fucking hate it.
[233:31.63]Okay.
[233:34.21]And they're in everything too.
[233:35.45]They put them in everything.
[233:39.65]Do we not have any more puzzles besides slide puzzles?
[233:42.77]They're in every fucking puzzle game.
[233:56.25]This one's right... I think the one with the three over here.
[233:59.65]I believe not even that.
[234:13.42]You're doing it wrong.
[234:15.70]Yeah, I'm about to watch the YouTube video of this at the end of this game.
[234:31.14]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[234:41.01]It's like telling me how to do it.
[234:55.19]Hold on.
[234:59.55]I fucking hate these!
[235:01.75]Dude, next Nancy Jerome I'm gonna play, I'm gonna look up, like, a review and see, does it have a slide puzzle in it?
[235:07.86]Because if it does, I'm skipping that one.
[235:09.56]There's 80 of these.
[235:17.86]Alright, I'm walking in.
[235:18.76]Everybody, I'm not looking at chat.
[235:19.80]I'm just going to get it done.
[235:20.80]We'll see you in about 10 minutes.
[235:22.75]Here we go.
[236:55.23]These things suck.
[236:56.55]Fucking asshole.
[237:08.99]I gotta get this one up here.
[237:10.36]If I get this one up there, then I'm good.
[237:19.36]But what a pain in the absolute balls.
[237:21.64]What a pain in the dick this is.
[237:30.91]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[237:33.32]This one has to go left.
[237:56.46]If I look over at chat, I see people say four of the six of the three of the eight.
[238:00.46]And I cannot even comprehend what you're saying.
[238:03.55]You're fucking my whole brain up.
[238:12.04]Okay.
[238:14.10]Lock it in.
[238:53.78]It's so close.
[238:55.62]It's so close.
[238:57.26]I'm almost there.
[238:59.78]But... I think... Do I have to move the top row now?
[239:06.82]I feel like I don't have to.
[239:10.78]Do I have to move the top row?
[239:17.65]I just hate it.
[239:23.84]I could probably solve, like... I could probably fucking... I don't know.
[239:28.08]I could probably solve... ...the science experiment.
[239:33.28]But that is in parentheses.
[239:36.95]I'd have to get this done before we do another fucking stretch ad break.
[239:40.73]And that's in five minutes, by the way.
[239:43.31]I gotta get this done in five minutes.
[239:51.27]Alright, I gotta look at the screen.
[239:53.15]Alright, here we go.
[239:53.86]Nobody talk.
[240:37.17]Got it.
[240:40.49]Hello?
[240:40.77]Hello?
[240:44.25]What's going on?
[240:45.37]Why did I... I didn't win?
[240:58.80]What?
[240:59.10]There's no... this... this doesn't fit anywhere else.
[241:07.79]Align the notches to the outside levers, then lock the levers according to the following.
[241:11.51]Whoa.
[241:12.27]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[241:14.93]I got to do this in a certain order.
[241:20.85]That's just mean.
[241:21.73]What?
[241:35.94]Okay.
[241:37.90]And lock the levers according to the following.
[241:39.86]So... 1, 3, 4, 5... Huh?
[241:40.94]1... 3... 4... 5?
[241:41.04]Then... What?
[241:41.64]These symbols are all, like, identical!
[242:08.15]It's just like brain melting.
[242:09.59]Okay, then these, between these two... Like the two fishes... Between the two fishes, it's... 1, 2, 4, 5, 7.
[242:17.82]1, 2, 4, 5, 7.
[242:18.86]And then this fish is swimming at each other.
[242:24.02]It's 1, 2, 3, 5, 7.
[242:39.40]That doesn't exist.
[242:41.46]This doesn't exist.
[242:47.38]Between these two, what?
[242:49.88]Fish right, fish left.
[242:51.62]Fish right.
[242:53.36]Fish left, what?
[243:00.56]Is it the bottom?
[243:11.11]Upside down fishes.
[243:13.49]I have one minute to fix this before I gotta take a break.
[243:18.40]Right to left bottom.
[243:23.44]Left to right, you mean.
[243:25.74]Boom, boom.
[243:26.18]Okay, I got it.
[243:27.58]One, two, three, five, seven.
[243:30.16]One, two, three, five, seven.
[243:34.20]And then left, left is one, three, four.
[243:37.26]But how do I know?
[243:41.33]Okay, one, three, four, one, three, four, five.
[243:44.93]One, three, four, five.
[243:48.46]Got it.
[243:48.72]Alright, let's go.
[243:56.28]And ladies and gentlemen, we will find out what that is, what's inside of here when we come back from this commercial break.
[244:03.93]Join us.
[244:06.25]Stay tuned for more.
[244:08.05]Onjerma sucks dick at every puzzle game he plays, and a bunch of people make fun of him for it.
[244:14.22]See you right after the break.
[244:20.44]I'll be right back.
[245:21.30]Thank you.
[247:38.05]Thank you.
[248:14.89]Welcome back.
[248:17.51]That'd be such an interesting name for a television show.
[248:24.37]Pumpkin seeds are good.
[248:26.26]Recommend them.
[248:27.30]Roasted salted pumpkin seeds are pretty good.
[248:31.20]They're kind of like a sunflower seeds 2.0.
[248:34.06]They're very good.
[248:40.30]Also confirm with me here.
[248:42.39]There should not have been a single pre-roll the entire broadcast.
[248:48.27]Not one.
[248:50.78]Is that confirmed?
[248:55.24]Maybe in the very, very, very beginning when the stream first turned on.
[249:00.10]But there shouldn't have been any at all.
[249:01.98]Like 0.0.
[249:09.25]Only the very, very beginning.
[249:10.15]Yeah.
[249:16.12]I got one midstream join?
[249:17.40]That should be impossible, actually.
[249:26.19]Very beginning, yeah.
[249:28.13]Okay, well.
[249:30.53]Alright, cool.
[249:36.00]Let's finish this up.
[249:38.83]What's in the safe?
[249:39.67]Let's find out.
[249:40.19]You guys ready?
[249:41.89]I'm at home.
[249:53.75]uh I Charlotte Ann Thornton a resident of the county of chatham state of Georgia do hereby declare this to be a codicil to my last will and testament dated April 16 1968 or what is it a change said last will is the following many
[250:17.54]I revoke Section A of my will pertaining to the distribution of my estate.
[250:22.40]I give, devise, and bequeath to Clara Olivia Thornton, a resident of the County of Chatham, State of Georgia, 100% of my estate, property, and effects.
[250:34.02]In place of this revoked provision, I substitute the following.
[250:38.40]I give, devise, and bequeath to Harper Shelby Thornton, a resident of the County of Chatham,
[250:46.24]State of Georgia.
[250:47.66]100% of my estate, property, and effects.
[250:49.70]In all the respects, I confirm my will dated April 16th.
[250:54.14]So this is a big freaking deal.
[250:59.91]The will was changed.
[251:03.73]Wait, what?
[251:05.09]I can't get out of here?
[251:06.03]Oh, God.
[251:22.12]Nancy, help.
[251:24.16]What's the matter?
[251:25.60]It's Harper.
[251:26.72]She's in bad shape.
[251:27.72]I can't carry her.
[251:31.45]I bet we could build something to get her out.
[251:33.39]There's no time to help.
[251:34.55]Alright, let's build something.
[251:36.05]I bet we could build something to get her out.
[251:42.51]Save the game.
[251:43.99]We're going to use this piece of shit to carry somebody out of here?
[251:47.53]Hmm.
[251:48.95]Hmm.
[251:50.09]Hmm.
[251:51.35]Hmm.
[251:55.02]Um, what?
[252:02.00]Okay, I didn't even know I just got that.
[252:05.74]This is not going to take anybody anywhere.
[252:07.29]Is that it?
[252:21.69]I gotta find all these wheels.
[252:23.31]Oh my god.
[252:36.21]Is another wheel somewhere?
[252:37.47]Thanks, I'll get her out.
[252:44.59]Oh, I gotta Nancy.
[252:45.54]My mother's upstairs.
[252:47.10]She's in the bedroom.
[252:48.68]It's too dangerous to ask you to help.
[252:51.78]You decide upstairs in the room.
[252:55.56]I don't care if it's dangerous.
[252:57.16]I will get her out.
[253:00.68]Oh my god, this is loud!
[253:02.04]Holy shit!
[253:02.94]What the fuck was that?
[253:04.02]Okay.
[253:05.26]What?
[253:32.56]Oh, we jump out the window?
[253:33.50]Open the painting.
[253:35.07]Wait, we were able to use the clocks?
[253:38.01]Alright.
[253:38.59]Hold on, stop, stop, stop.
[253:39.53]This one is, which one was this one?
[253:41.03]What?
[253:41.23]I can't change them.
[254:02.69]I can't change these.
[254:03.41]No, I can't change it.
[254:04.13]Oh, hold on.
[254:04.55]6.
[254:04.61]Um... What was it again?
[254:05.43]6.
[254:05.45]It was 12, 6?
[254:06.01]I don't remember.
[254:06.75]12.
[254:06.77]This one was 12, right?
[254:08.07]This one was...
[254:30.68]This one right into here?
[254:32.00]No, no, this one was 6.
[254:37.40]6, 12.
[254:37.48]This one was... It was a 3 and a 9, right?
[254:43.33]Oh, no.
[254:43.51]It was 2, 9.
[254:43.81]This one was 6, too.
[254:53.53]Okay.
[254:53.67]Okay.
[255:13.89]What?
[255:14.71]Uh-oh.
[255:16.87]It's different.
[255:18.75]I think that... Wait, are they different now?
[255:19.96]Oh, shit.
[255:27.52]Wait, is this the one where people were spamming the other one?
[255:29.70]They were spamming a different solution.
[255:33.58]I didn't even pay attention.
[255:34.36]I just assumed it was going to be done.
[255:35.34]Uh-oh.
[255:50.08]Somebody said it was like 10, 10, 10.
[255:50.70]Hold on.
[256:00.55]I could have just looked.
[256:01.95]Oh my God.
[256:02.59]I just, I'm freaking out.
[256:05.35]What is this one at?
[256:05.85]This one is, alright, that one was 10.
[256:08.46]This one, I set this one to 10.
[256:13.06]So this one was, okay, that actually was set to 10 and it was midnight.
[256:21.10]10.
[256:21.12]I don't, I gotta, I have to see them from, I have to see them from midnight.
[256:25.80]I don't know.
[256:27.54]I literally wasn't even looking.
[256:36.53]No, go the other way.
[256:37.27]Alright, I just need to see where the other ones land.
[256:58.52]So this is on one...
[257:03.49]He's giggling maniacally.
[257:05.73]This is on 1245.
[257:06.35]So it needs to be... What the fuck?
[257:07.83]It is 1245.
[257:08.63]That means it needs to be at 1120?
[257:09.55]1115?
[257:09.57]1140? 1140?
[257:30.34]Oh, 1115.
[257:30.52]Yeah, 1115.
[257:30.72]This one was on 10.
[257:31.20]What the hell is this one at?
[257:33.46]This one is 110.
[257:33.98]110 minus an hour and 10 minutes would be, you got to do 11, 10, 50, 1050.
[258:00.28]$10.50.
[258:00.30]This one is $1.35.
[258:01.12]So that would be $12.00.
[258:01.94]$12.05.
[258:01.96]No, $10.05. $10.55.
[258:24.75]I fucking lost it.
[258:26.25]It's 10... 10 what?
[258:28.38]10... You guys are saying so much shit, it's fucking up my brain.
[258:30.34]1050, right?
[258:34.50]No, it's 1055.
[258:41.76]And then this one is... 910.
[258:42.50]So it needs to be... Fuck, what is this one?
[258:48.95]This is three hours.
[258:52.73]Um...
[259:03.27]Eight.
[259:10.16]Eight what?
[259:10.60]Eight, uh, eight.
[259:16.36]I forgot what it was.
[259:17.23]I forgot what it actually was before.
[259:18.67]I just changed it.
[259:32.41]850.
[259:33.45]830?
[259:33.47]840.
[259:33.55]It's 850.
[259:34.59]Okay, this one's fucked up.
[259:36.35]This one has to be 955, right?
[259:41.53]One of these has to be 955.
[259:42.21]This one's wrong, right?
[259:47.70]Is this one right?
[259:48.24]Wrong?
[259:48.88]Wrong, right?
[259:51.54]This one's right.
[259:52.28]Wrong?
[259:53.74]Middle one is 1050.
[259:54.18]Okay, I had it wrong.
[259:59.13]1050.
[259:59.15]There it is.
[259:59.61]Okay.
[259:59.77]Is everything good?
[260:00.73]12, 950, 11, 1050, 11.
[260:01.63]What?
[260:01.77]The last one is wrong.
[260:02.50]What does this one have to be?
[260:03.50]This is currently at 855.
[260:05.66]It needs to be 955.
[260:06.16]We're good?
[260:30.21]1055?
[260:30.41]Third is 10... Now you guys are confusing each other.
[260:39.47]You guys are confusing each other now and me.
[260:43.21]We don't even remember what it was.
[260:45.05]Just send it.
[260:45.55]I'm going.
[260:54.11]Oh, fuck.
[260:59.51]Why are there five... Why are there five clocks on the mantle?
[261:07.28]Well, you see... It's because... Alright, it was 10... This one was 10.50?
[261:22.56]My stomach hurts.
[261:24.14]This is 10.50.
[261:34.93]$11.50 for this one.
[261:36.01]No, was it $10.50 or $11.50?
[261:37.11]I think it's $11... Is it $10.50?
[261:37.61]It's $11.15.
[261:37.79]No, $11.50.
[261:37.89]I think it was $10.50 before.
[261:38.41]This one was... This one's $10.50? $10.50?
[262:05.01]No, this one's not.
[262:05.63]It's 11.
[262:05.83]It's 11, like... I don't remember what it was.
[262:10.31]I should have taken a picture of it.
[262:11.37]1130, 930, 1065.
[262:13.19]That's not even a real number, dude.
[262:19.33]1115 on this one?
[262:36.07]Oh my God.
[262:36.81]I don't fucking care anymore.
[262:49.89]Get the fuck out of here.
[262:52.68]I'm done with this game.
[262:54.34]I'm done with this game.
[262:56.74]I'm done with this shit.
[263:01.01]People are just putting the solution in the chat and I'm trying them.
[263:05.46]And you know, I'm open to my own.
[263:07.60]I'm Googling my own answer here.
[263:08.68]Is this good?
[263:15.15]11, 10 o'clock here.
[263:37.73]Fuck an epilogue who gives a shit about the epilogue What The same incorrect
[264:29.09]Oh, I'm having a good time.
[264:32.04]Oh my God, my throat hurts.
[264:58.89]That's it.
[264:59.21]I win.
[265:02.25]You piece of fucking shit.
[265:03.95]What are you talking about?
[265:06.63]What are you talking about?
[265:14.06]11, 10, 11, 30, 11.
[265:15.40]No, that's not correct.
[265:18.74]You messed the last one up again.
[265:20.54]What the fuck?
[265:25.54]11.
[265:25.56]9.
[265:25.66]That's what I did.
[265:27.28]11.
[265:27.30]9.
[265:27.32]30.
[265:27.34]This is 11 o'clock.
[265:27.92]11 o'clock.
[265:28.50]9.
[265:28.52]30.
[265:28.54]9 o'clock.
[265:28.86]This is 9.
[265:29.18]30.
[265:29.20]10.
[265:29.22]30.
[265:30.84]There you go.
[265:31.22]10.
[265:31.24]30.
[265:31.56]It's 10 o'clock.
[265:32.10]10.
[265:32.12]30.
[265:33.21]Wonderful.
[265:33.59]Okay.
[265:33.73]Then it's 10. 10.
[265:58.32]10 o'clock.
[265:59.60]Bingo.
[266:00.58]Great.
[266:02.00]Then 8 o'clock.
[266:10.13]This is it.
[266:12.15]This is it.
[266:13.23]Is it 7.55?
[266:17.99]Because everybody's wrong.
[266:19.57]And so is the cheating, by the way.
[266:30.84]This is correct, right?
[266:32.47]But it's eight!
[266:34.13]Send it like this?
[266:34.87]Okay, are we sending- am I sending it like this?
[266:58.01]What?

[266:59.53]It was 8 o'clock.
[267:00.43]Is it 7?
[267:01.05]Is it 8.05?
[267:02.47]8 o'clock stopped at the same place too.
[267:07.31]It's 8.05.
[267:10.18]This is fucking bullshit.
[267:11.60]7.55.
[267:11.62]11.
[267:11.64]9.30. 11.
[267:29.51]They're all waiting for me outside.
[267:33.57]Oh, God.
[267:34.15]Okay, that's 9.30, 10.30.
[267:34.91]We're doing fine, everybody.
[267:37.57]How you doing?
[267:40.67]You guys doing good?
[267:41.08]You guys having fun?
[267:41.62]This one's 10.
[267:43.42]10 o'clock.
[267:43.74]And then it's 7.55.
[267:44.10]Okay, here's 7 o'clock. 7.55.
[268:00.96]No, no.
[268:01.46]If I do 805 and it's wrong, I'm going to eat my fucking mouse.
[268:06.39]It's 805.
[268:06.93]Okay.
[268:13.04]What the fuck?
[268:14.20]Do it.
[268:30.37]Guys, what is happening right now?
[268:34.27]Why are these wrong?
[268:41.70]These were correct before.
[268:44.48]It was just this one that... We all saw that happen in real time.
[268:51.24]I don't know what's going on.
[268:52.48]You said 1030.
[268:52.90]Okay, I'm fucking turning chat off.
[268:56.83]I'm just doing it.
[269:02.14]How does this make any sense?
[269:08.99]One of my... Modchat, Modchat, Modchat. 1150...
[269:23.33]Alright.
[269:24.79]Mods, write out the solution for me in full, plain English.
[269:30.95]That's what I just did.
[269:31.98]Not the mod chat.
[269:34.16]I'm talking to chat now.
[269:35.84]The one that they're spamming, I just did it.
[269:43.22]This is insane, right?
[269:44.64]Am I going crazy?
[269:45.18]First clock, 1150.
[269:45.78]This is 11 o'clock.
[269:52.32]This is 1150.
[269:55.54]That's the first clock.
[269:56.45]The first clock is correct.
[269:57.39]And I want everyone... I want the whole church here to say, Amen.
[270:02.07]Okay?
[270:02.85]First clock.
[270:03.85]Amen.
[270:06.86]Second clock.
[270:07.26]1135.
[270:07.28]11 o'clock.
[270:07.52]1130.
[270:07.54]1135. 1135.
[270:18.82]Can I get an amen, please?
[270:19.46]For the second clock.
[270:20.14]Third clock.
[270:20.40]1145.
[270:20.42]This is 1145.
[270:20.60]Can I get an amen?
[270:20.98]For the third clock.
[270:47.27]Okay, fourth clock is 1140.
[270:50.05]Shit's just fallen.
[270:55.85]This is 11 o'clock.
[270:57.97]This is 1140.
[271:00.36]Can I please get an amen on the fourth clock?
[271:08.92]Okay, the fifth clock, this is 1120.
[271:15.75]11 here is 11 20. we get an amen on the fifth clock okay that's it everybody thank you uh let's say a final amen let's go ahead and send it there it is thank god I'm getting you out of here just let me stay
[271:45.30]Thank you mods, I appreciate it.
[271:50.78]So there must be a half a dozen solutions to that puzzle then.
[271:55.75]Because some of you guys were right and then sometimes they were wrong because it was, I don't know.
[272:00.55]Oh my God.
[272:08.52]Did I make it?
[272:09.30]Dear Ned, I was able to pull Clara out of the fire just in time.
[272:14.16]We rushed out the front door before the stairs collapsed.
[272:17.34]Imagine my relief when I saw that Jessalyn and Harper had made it out safely as well.
[272:22.97]Clara finally told Jessalyn the truth, and about how sure she was that she'd be pushed out of the family entirely when she discovered Charlotte had changed her will.
[272:32.58]How jealous and powerless she felt the night she lit the match.
[272:35.87]And how badly she wanted to scare Charlotte.
[272:38.55]How quickly the fire got out of control.
[272:41.09]And how heartbroken she was at Charlotte's death.
[272:44.33]She would have given anything to take that night back.
[272:46.51]Hey, that was good.
[272:47.09]That was fun.
[272:47.49]Jessalyn later said that was the first time she saw the real Clara.
[272:51.59]Who wasn't a cold-blooded killer.
[272:53.79]Just a woman so dedicated to hiding from her past.
[272:57.33]She lost herself.
[273:00.04]The fire department traced the source of the blaze back to the 14 furnace in the basement and insisted we all visit the hospital for exposure to toxic fumes.
[273:09.09]The doctor I saw explained that carbon monoxide from Harper's furnace may be the cause of some of the unexplained things I saw around the house.
[273:17.53]Apparently, many of the ghosts in Victorian-era fiction may have been inspired by the effects of exposure to carbon monoxide from faulty heaters.
[273:26.66]It was a gas leak?
[273:27.36]Wasn't I seeing the ghost outside?
[273:28.64]I'm really hoping things work out for those two.
[273:57.26]How would I see the ghost outside of a... No, it was never outside.
[274:00.10]Harper disappeared shortly after the fire.
[274:17.02]It was no gas leak.
[274:18.56]Nancy is just fried.
[274:39.10]Jocelyn loved the idea and considered it the first meaningful step toward building a company and a family that would have made Charlotte proud.
[274:46.62]If you ever find yourself visiting Black Rock Island, the creepiest thing you're likely to encounter is Harper enjoying a good Black Rock Mountain.
[274:54.01]We're about to go there in about five to ten minutes.
[274:57.55]And maybe those trees, but it's not their fault they look like that.
[275:01.93]As for me, I'm looking forward to good old non-haunted river heights.
[275:06.37]Can't wait to see you.
[275:08.07]Love, Nancy.
[275:12.82]Wait, okay, I have a final quiz.
[275:16.04]Who was the founding couple of the Thornton family?
[275:19.24]That would be Beauregard Thornton and Emmeline Wright.
[275:24.92]Thank you.
[275:25.30]Uh, there's apparently awards.
[275:36.25]That was a really harsh correct sound.
[275:44.03]You know your way around teacup.
[275:48.08]For leaving no ghost unturned.
[275:49.66]We saw the ghost at every place that I could see it.
[275:55.60]I guess I could have made something in the... That cotton gin?
[276:02.49]I knew I heard all the secrets.
[276:05.31]I died, I guess, enough times to get a gravestone.
[276:11.05]Key spinner?
[276:11.43]Key spinner?
[276:13.25]Everybody lived.
[276:13.97]I got the everybody lived.
[276:17.13]No spoilers for you, heroic one.
[276:21.85]But here's the thing.
[276:22.41]They don't know that I have a guide in the second monitor.
[276:24.81]They can't track that.
[276:25.53]Do you know what I mean?
[276:29.12]I have a chat room full of people giving me answers and in the game facts that are possible to look at.
[276:37.18]So I think I should return this one.
[276:42.11]Looking at ghosts, okay.
[276:45.57]Wait, the very end of the game, the last thing is a trophy?
[276:49.84]So I couldn't 100% the game?
[276:51.78]What time is it?
[277:04.00]Oh.
[277:04.12]I don't know.
[277:11.20]Am I getting my phone getting hacked?
[277:13.56]That's it.
[277:13.96]What the fuck?
[277:33.20]You don't hang up.
[277:34.18]You don't hang up on the fucking.
[277:35.83]You don't hang up on Jigsaw.
[277:37.37]Yeah, you don't hang up on Saw.
[277:45.42]Scammers.
[277:46.00]Yeah, it was a scammer.
[277:47.34]Guys, don't even tell me that that person was not going to go tell me to buy $500 worth of iPhone gift cards.
[278:01.85]I'm not going to go buy $500 worth of Apple Pay.
[278:04.31]Alright, well that was fun.
[278:10.15]There you go.
[278:12.14]I finally finished the game that everybody wanted me to finish.
[278:20.34]Oh, that's so stupid.
[278:21.16]I love it.
[278:31.20]Okay, so now... We're going to play some World of Warcraft.
[278:37.45]I feel like leveling a little bit.
[278:42.33]I want to get to at least level 18.
[278:45.99]But two claps.

[282:53.05]What?
[283:20.47]That's Nancy Drew and the Silent Spy.
[283:33.58]Okay, did they make a hundred Nancy Drew games in the same like five year period?
[283:39.24]And there's a vault somewhere that they just release them and they can continue to release them for the next like 500 years?
[283:51.91]There are 34 Nancy Drew games on Wikipedia.
[283:56.43]They made two a year for years.
[284:00.37]You know what?
[284:00.73]That's cool.

[285:00.13]Did you have fun?
[285:00.77]I did, yeah.
[285:01.67]Those games are always fun.
[285:03.23]Those games are fun because they're
[285:07.68]Sometimes they're kind of annoying to play, but they have really interesting, weird stuff going on.
[285:11.25]There's funny things that happen.
[285:13.79]It's fun.
[285:16.33]It's cute.
[285:17.01]It's Nancy Drew.
[285:17.93]It's a fun, cute, mystery experience.
[285:23.94]It's fine.
[285:25.72]It's a cozy game.
[285:26.86]That's all it needs to be.
[285:31.86]Yes, if I say a game was cute, that usually means I think it was like a 6.
[285:37.57]But that was definitely like a 7.
[285:39.31]That was like a 7.4.
[285:39.93]7.2.
[285:40.03]It's cozy.
[285:43.75]What's wrong with it?
[285:44.29]Nothing wrong with it.
