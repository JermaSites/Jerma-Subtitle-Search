[ve:60.16.100]

[00:16.33]How come I can't put it on here?
[00:26.58]What the fuck?
[00:30.00]What the fuck?
[00:33.34]Oh, hold on.
[00:34.40]I think I got it.
[00:44.80]There we go, alright.
[00:45.26]Alright, let's do a bread tier list.
[00:54.73]Look up the ending?
[00:57.29]I don't- true endings- I don't need true ending.
[01:06.64]That'd have to be true ending.
[01:12.93]Alright, let's get it.
[01:14.53]Red tier list.
[01:20.31]My windows always get so fucked up.
[01:24.39]Okay.
[01:41.96]So this is a very important tier list for a lot of you, I think.
[01:46.94]Um, I can see it better.
[01:48.52]Alright, I'm gonna, I'm quitting this.
[01:49.76]We don't need to be in here anymore.
[01:50.62]This is, that game was really cool.
[01:51.70]It was really, like, just a chill game.
[01:53.26]I liked it a lot.
[01:55.28]Alright, bread tier list, I'm ready.
[02:04.08]Put on Olive Garden music for this?
[02:06.34]Actually, kind of a fucking good idea.
[02:18.56]There's a lot on this list.
[02:22.64]Alright, right there.
[02:23.64]That's where it is.
[02:24.52]Alright, let's make it a little bigger.
[02:26.22]Alright, you guys ready?
[02:32.52]The quintessential bread tier list.
[02:38.38]Sourdough's number one?
[02:39.32]What the fuck?
[02:43.42]Oh my god, no it's not.
[02:45.00]I want that person timed out.
[02:47.04]I actually want you timed out.
[02:51.61]Can we make this IRL?
[02:55.91]I need music though, you're right.
[03:01.51]Uh, Olive Garden music?
[03:13.03]Olive Garden theme song.
[03:14.47]Club remix?
[03:16.05]There's a club remix.
[03:18.51]Why is there a club remix of this?
[03:34.25]Is this Olive Garden?
[03:35.27]I don't think this is even the Olive Garden.
[03:43.70]Okay, here we go.
[03:48.83]Bagel.
[03:50.85]That's a straight up A.
[03:53.73]Bagel can be used as a sandwich topping.
[03:55.99]It can be used as a breakfast, as a lunch, as a dinner.
[03:59.71]You can do bagels and lox.
[04:00.89]You can do bagels, eggs, and cheese.
[04:02.59]You can do bagel, tuna, sandwich.
[04:04.64]Versatility.
[04:07.76]Hawaiian roll.
[04:09.30]S. Hawaiian roll.
[04:10.82]S.
[04:11.54]100%.
[04:12.06]No fighting me on that one.
[04:13.70]Hawaiian rolls are S. S.
[04:21.64]If you buy a bag of Hawaiian rolls, you better be ready for that bag to be gone within a day.
[04:28.35]Within one day.
[04:33.71]They don't last long.
[04:35.45]You will never take a bag of Hawaiian rolls and turn it like this and go, is that mold?
[04:42.37]I don't know, there's like eight, there's like, how many slices are in here?
[04:45.09]One, two, three, four, five.
[04:46.03]I think that's mold.
[04:46.81]Nope, never gonna happen.
[04:47.99]It's gone every time.
[04:50.03]Oatmeal bread.
[04:51.07]Yeah.
[04:52.01]Hmm.
[04:52.39]Okay.
[04:53.39]Rye bread, uh, it's a D. Unless it's with a Reuben sandwich and then it becomes a B. Brioche?
[05:01.58]A. Bagels are better.
[05:09.30]A whole wheat bread?
[05:10.10]I guess it's an F. I fucking hate wheat bread.
[05:11.90]It sucks.
[05:13.81]I feel- I know.
[05:14.97]I- Anytime anybody says, hey, whiter wheat.
[05:19.32]I go, bro, white every time.
[05:21.04]Like, I don't like wheat bread.
[05:22.08]I just don't.
[05:23.16]It just makes it taste different.
[05:24.70]It tastes... Bread, to me, is texture and a little bit of flavor.
[05:28.67]Whole wheat bread changes, like, the flavor of a sandwich.
[05:32.59]Sure, I don't care.
[05:33.39]Call me whatever you want.
[05:35.09]Banana bread, this is very close to S. I'm not sure if I want to put this in S. I'm going to put it in A. It depends.
[05:40.65]There's really shitty banana bread, and there's really great banana bread.
[05:44.26]There's banana breads that are dog shit.
[05:46.99]But if you get a moist, a dense, moist banana bread, wow, that's absolute A+.
[05:54.84]Cornbread is also the same.
[05:56.40]There's a lot of really shitty cornbread.
[05:59.80]Dry cornbread.
[06:01.42]But if you get the real good stuff, this might level up.
[06:06.04]Maybe.
[06:06.83]Depends.
[06:07.89]I think so.
[06:10.35]Cinnamon bread, F.
[06:13.00]I'm sorry, I just don't like it.
[06:14.50]I am not a fan of cinnamon.
[06:18.82]You all know that.
[06:20.38]Everybody knows that at this point.
[06:21.60]This channel has been... This channel started with me hating cinnamon.
[06:25.53]I don't really like cinnamon as a condiment, as a seasoning.
[06:28.41]I'm not a fan.
[06:29.41]I actually don't think it belongs... These actually probably both don't belong in F. But... Are people saying quackity?
[06:39.07]What do you mean quackity?
[06:39.97]What?
[06:41.41]Oh, they gifted subs.
[06:44.09]What's up, Quackity?
[06:46.77]Anyways, we're doing good takes here.
[06:51.66]Croissants.
[06:53.06]Croissants are an S for flavor, but an F for practicality.
[06:58.44]Eating a croissant, you have to vacuum your shirt.
[07:01.98]What is this song?
[07:02.82]This is not Olive Garden.
[07:14.17]Yeah, when you eat croissants, they're delicious.
[07:19.10]But you literally have to vacuum it closed afterwards.
[07:22.02]So hold on, I'll put it in the right spot.
[07:24.26]I need some restaurant music.
[07:25.77]Here we go.
[07:26.15]There we go.
[07:30.37]That's more Olive Garden.
[07:34.04]Okay.
[07:35.34]Croissant is F for malleability, mandibleability, whatever it's called.
[07:42.79]We're talking flavor only.
[07:44.47]And I have like a tray underneath that I can catch the croissant crumbles.
[07:48.55]I'm going to give it an A. Biscuits.
[07:55.24]Some biscuits, they're dry as fuck a lot of times, but you know what?
[07:57.58]I'm going to have to, people are going to be mad about this, but I'm going to give it a B.
[08:03.06]I already know where this is going.
[08:04.42]So I need to do this now.
[08:05.96]Let's get this out of the way.
[08:07.78]Because people are going to be mad.
[08:09.96]English muffins are horrible.
[08:13.06]English muffins just have a bad taste.
[08:14.64]I don't like it.
[08:17.06]I don't really... I really don't like English muffins.
[08:23.05]English muffins to me taste like somebody made a bagel biscuit.
[08:27.55]Like a biscuit.
[08:28.79]And they put a droplet of artificial bread flavoring on it.
[08:33.45]It's, I don't know, I don't like the taste.
[08:34.75]It tastes like baby powder.
[08:38.07]Like when I bite into an English muffin, it's like baby powder.
[08:40.45]Okay, a McDonald's like sausage egg McMuffin.
[08:47.96]Yeah, I'd eat it.
[08:49.26]That brings it up to like here.
[08:51.28]But I really don't like English muffins.
[08:53.40]I'm sorry, I just don't.
[08:56.94]I don't, what is it?
[08:57.88]What is yeast bread?
[08:58.78]What is that?
[08:59.09]Yeast bread?
[09:00.29]Yeast bread?
[09:02.80]Isn't that just bread?
[09:03.52]I kind of don't really know what that is.
[09:05.32]So I'm gonna... What is it?
[09:08.64]Just bread?
[09:11.40]Bagels are failed donuts.
[09:12.62]They're vile creations.
[09:15.96]A bagel is amazing.
[09:16.74]A bagel is versatile.
[09:22.12]I'm just gonna... I don't know where to put this, so... Potato bread!
[09:25.22]Yes.
[09:28.13]Potato bread is everything I like about white bread, but it's not just default shitty white bread.
[09:32.76]Right?
[09:33.26]But I like default shitty white bread.
[09:36.96]I don't think it's better than Hawaiian roll, but I think potato bread is like... It's like if you want white bread, potato bread is like the cool version.
[09:45.18]I love potato bread.
[09:45.88]It's fantastic.
[09:50.66]Not only does this have cinnamon in it, it has gross raisins too.
[09:54.27]This is going down here.
[09:57.92]Cinnamon raisin bread.
[09:58.84]No, I'm just not into it.
[10:02.42]Where's white bread?
[10:03.08]Let's do it.
[10:05.30]White bread is like a... Like a B. No, white bread's like a C. I probably would rather eat white bread than oatmeal bread, though.
[10:16.86]Because what even... What is oatmeal bread?
[10:20.36]I don't like cinnamons.
[10:21.74]I don't like cinnamons like raisin shit.
[10:23.62]I don't like that.
[10:27.37]Flatbread is, it's alright.
[10:29.67]It's good for, like, little sandwich rolls and everything.
[10:32.17]Tortilla.
[10:33.27]Flour tortilla.
[10:34.91]Is corn tortilla on here?
[10:36.74]Well, that wouldn't be bread, would it?
[10:37.70]Okay, but this is S. I love tortilla.
[10:43.42]A good flour tortilla?
[10:47.22]Cook it on the stove?
[10:49.32]Oh yeah.
[10:50.73]Hell yeah, absolutely.
[10:52.15]So good.
[10:53.41]So good.
[10:54.95]Sourdough.
[10:57.55]Oh, sourdough is, you know, it's, I would say it's like kind of reminds me of, um, like biting into something that like, eh.
[11:09.07]You know why I don't like sourdough bread?
[11:13.27]Here's why.
[11:20.29]That's why.
[11:23.71]Every piece of sourdough I've ever had goes like that.
[11:28.57]Oh!
[11:29.79]Oh, sourdough!
[11:30.67]Oh my god, so fresh!
[11:31.55]Mmm!
[11:37.78]Mmm!
[11:39.30]I can feel it in my mouth.
[11:40.38]I have to bite down hard.
[11:41.68]No.
[11:46.46]The sourdough flavor is up here.
[11:51.65]I'm willing to forgive sourdough for being tough and chewy.
[12:00.97]+2, it still fucks, though.
[12:05.37]Why are you fucking bread?
[12:06.43]What are you talking about?
[12:10.57]I'd say it's... I'm gonna just give it a B. I think it tastes good.
[12:13.80]It's better than white bread.
[12:17.32]Garlic bread!
[12:18.28]Oh, garlic bread.
[12:20.24]Garlic bread's... But that's, to me, my answer, though.
[12:22.08]Do I really think garlic bread's better than, like, banana bread?
[12:29.11]Okay, is garlic bread better than cornbread?
[12:32.35]don't think so I I mean I love garlic bread but what I was is it better than like a good moist banana bread probably not or a good bagel like a fresh bagel god if you get a fresh bagel from like a bagel factory one of those like bagel factories uh restaurants where they make the bagels there and they're fresh and you get it hot right in the morning I think it's better I do
[13:00.80]French bread is in the same category as croissant.
[13:03.22]It's another bread that when you take a bite out of it, you need like a little dirt devil to vacuum your like crotch.
[13:08.56]Because it just gets everywhere, but it's fucking unbelievable.
[13:11.41]I think it's better than croissant.
[13:12.29]I think it's better than brioche too.
[13:15.69]French bread just like is garlic bread, just with stuff on it.
[13:18.11]So what is it?
[13:19.13]Does it really matter where it goes?
[13:28.50]Whole grain bread is at the very bottom.
[13:34.88]I would rather eat cinnamon raisin bread off the ground than eat a piece of whole grain bread.
[13:48.67]It's awful.
[13:50.70]I know.
[13:51.38]Oh, you're like, you have like a 10-year-old's palate.
[13:54.64]Whole grain bread sucks, and everybody knows it.
[13:58.02]You don't bite into whole, like all like the weird like nuts and shit.
[14:00.56]I don't like the plastic tasting things.
[14:04.04]It's like the big chunks of like grains and like little like seeds on it.
[14:08.43]It's like, it's like bird food to me.
[14:11.89]It's like bird seed all over it.
[14:13.37]I don't like it.
[14:13.75]It's got bird seed all over it.
[14:15.11]I don't like whole grain bread.
[14:15.97]I think it's bad.
[14:21.12]Pretzel bread is, uh, is... Up here.
[14:23.58]S. In fact, pretzel bread's better than Hawaiian rolls.
[14:27.14]I might come back to that in a minute.
[14:30.37]I might come back to this in just a moment.
[14:34.85]But I... Pretzel bread could be the best thing in the world.
[14:37.63]Bread-wise, I think.
[14:38.39]Yep.
[14:42.97]We'll see.
[14:43.69]I can change it if I need to.
[14:46.97]What?
[14:48.12]Okay, potato bread is not a 10-year-old palate.
[14:52.26]That's, like, pretty sophisticated.
[14:53.39]Hawaiian rolls?
[14:54.13]That's a sophisticated palette.
[14:58.23]Pita bread's pretty good.
[14:59.75]I think it's like a B. I love, uh, gyros.
[15:07.29]Pita bread's usually pretty fantastic.
[15:09.77]This with hummus is fantastic.
[15:13.12]I don't think I would put it up here, though.
[15:19.96]I mean, breadsticks are fine, but
[15:23.27]they're fine I like breadsticks I don't think they're better than like a croissant actually yeah I probably okay do I would I rather have a breadstick or a pita bread probably breadstick I might have to re-evaluate this in a minute in a little bit here we'll see alright this is the bread from Outback we know what that's going up here somewhere
[15:48.39]Okay, pumpernickel bread and croissants are the exact same in my brain.
[15:53.75]I need to be in the mood to eat a croissant.
[15:58.43]I don't just like, oh, you know what?
[15:59.42]Yeah, I'll have a croissant today.
[16:01.00]That's a reason why I get it, why I eat it.
[16:02.76]Pumpernickel is like, I have to have a reason to eat it.
[16:10.66]I don't go to the store and go, like, oh, yeah, yeah, where's the pumpernickel bread?
[16:14.63]No, I usually get, like, potato bread, or let's take a white bread, or even a wheat bread sometimes.
[16:19.51]Is it bread from Outback?
[16:23.63]Yeah, it is good.
[16:24.41]That's why it's an A. It's up an A tier.
[16:26.11]What are you talking about?
[16:28.64]Outback bread is white bread painted brown.
[16:33.44]Is it really?
[16:36.86]No, it's not.
[16:39.16]What is the bread from Outback?
[16:41.22]It's not pumpernickel?
[16:49.64]What is the bread at Outback?
[16:56.53]What is the bread at Outback made out of?
[16:59.33]Honey and molasses wheat bread roll.
[17:15.63]But no, wheat bread sucks!
[17:17.47]Wait, that's a honey and molasses.
[17:19.81]Honey and molasses wheat bread roll.
[17:22.03]Not just generic ass wheat bread.
[17:25.09]No, they're both going down here.
[17:26.09]Fuck them both.
[17:28.01]Fuck them both, who cares.
[17:30.25]Anon is up at A, high A. To me, Anon is like a pita bread, but, uh, like, evolved.
[17:38.38]Pita bread's like the Squirtle.
[17:40.22]And naan is like the... Squirrelmo.
[17:43.22]Whatever his name is.
[17:44.18]Whatever.
[17:45.50]Naan is just that kind of off-grid of pita bread.
[17:49.62]I don't think it's better than garlic bread.
[17:50.60]It actually might be.
[17:53.43]Maybe.
[17:55.53]Pumpernickel.
[17:56.15]I like pumpernickel.
[17:56.87]Why is it down here?
[17:59.17]It's definitely like up here.
[18:00.27]It'd be.
[18:01.63]Zucchini bread?
[18:02.49]I don't know.
[18:03.15]That's some TikTok shit.
[18:03.99]I don't want it.
[18:06.26]Butter bread and butter bread.
[18:15.72]What are these?
[18:16.27]I don't think I've had these before.
[18:27.33]I don't think I've eaten butter bread.
[18:28.65]I don't think I've had it.
[18:30.84]Where would I have eaten this?
[18:34.67]My grandmother makes zucchini bread, dude.
[18:36.38]That's not TikTok shit.
[18:45.45]I don't know, it's zucchini bread?
[18:48.79]The Chick-fil-A minis are butter bread.
[18:51.90]I don't, I don't, I can't think about, I can't remember what it, like, tastes like.
[18:55.37]What it is like, right?
[18:56.59]Alright, let me make sure this is correct.
[18:59.73]Pretzel bread, yep.
[19:00.85]Wine roll, this is tough.
[19:02.53]Yeah, this is right.
[19:03.73]I think my S tier is right.
[19:11.28]A good fresh French roll, though.
[19:13.12]God.
[19:14.34]Damn it, it's good.
[19:15.44]Um...
[19:17.71]I'm trying to think of, like, biting into, like, a moist, delicious, just savory, just aromatic piece of banana bread.
[19:25.91]You know what I mean?
[19:26.43]The kind of bread where you can go like this with the bread, squish it, and you let go, and it does not come back to form factor.
[19:33.03]It's squished.
[19:34.49]It's fucking squished.
[19:45.48]I changed my mind.
[19:54.21]No.
[19:58.07]Cornbread or flour tortilla.
[20:04.50]I feel like brioche is just better than most of these.
[20:06.84]Somehow.
[20:07.50]Right?
[20:08.02]But I don't know.
[20:11.72]I love bagels so much.
[20:14.54]I could eat bagels breakfast lunch.
[20:16.59]Why can't I say the K in breakfast?
[20:18.47]I could eat a bagel breakfast lunch and dinner and be happy about it.
[20:28.87]Here's the exact same tier list from a year and a half ago that you did.
[20:32.93]What?
[20:33.17]Are you serious?
[20:42.61]I did this already?
[20:53.54]This is my list?
[20:55.04]I did this already?
[20:56.42]So what does it look like?
[20:58.74]Oh, someone's got a screenshot.
[20:59.64]Here we go.
[21:00.30]Wait, hold on.
[21:00.96]I need to compare.
[21:03.28]Let's compare it.
[21:04.78]It's pretty fucking close, guys.
[21:06.62]It's pretty close.
[21:08.00]It's pretty close.
[21:11.70]It's close, man.
[21:13.26]Hold on.
[21:14.96]If I were to stop this right now, right?
[21:20.78]Let's overlay it.
[21:32.46]Yo, this is pretty much the same.
[21:34.22]This is pretty good.
[21:35.04]What is... What's not up here?
[21:39.78]Croissant is up at S now?
[21:47.94]Potato bread, potato bread.
[21:49.22]Pretzel bread, pretzel bread.
[21:50.66]Croissant.
[21:52.22]I must have had a shitty croissant.
[21:53.43]I must have had a shitty croissant.
[21:56.51]You know, at some point over the last two years, I probably bit into a croissant and went...
[22:02.28]got pissed I'm some that's probably that's that is what happened banana bread yeah I must have had a really moist banana bread biscuit biscuits whoa it took a took a nosedive here pita bread took a dive nan flatbread took a dive cornbread evolved white bread kind of jumped up oatmeal bread
[22:27.49]Okay, but yeah, but remember, all these things that are in D, I was afraid to piss off like the bread Andes in chat, right?
[22:34.89]So I couldn't make them F. Where's garlic bread on this?
[22:41.56]Wow, garlic bread was a fucking C. I stand by my list.
[22:47.50]You did this exact same list already.
[22:50.66]I'm kind of curious.
[22:52.70]What are some of the... I did a fast food one.
[22:55.79]Are my tastes kind of the same?
[23:03.08]You were wearing the same shirt.
[23:08.10]I was?
[23:08.48]No, I wasn't.
[23:16.30]You just did the fast food.
[23:17.04]What's another one that I've done?
[23:19.78]What's some of the popular ones?
[23:20.64]It's like candy, soda, chips and stuff, right?
[23:25.08]What's one that I haven't done?
[23:26.82]In a while that I have done to see if I... Because I don't remember.
[23:28.83]I don't remember anything.
[23:29.71]Cheeses...
[23:32.56]Baby food?
[23:39.12]You did fruits before?
[23:40.02]Pumpkin bread?
[23:43.22]I don't like it.
[23:46.30]You did the same grin.
[23:48.76]You didn't do cookie run characters yet.
[23:59.83]Alright, so should I- what's another one?
[24:01.19]This is done.
[24:01.91]I'm happy with this.
[24:08.10]Should I do, like, soda?
[24:09.54]Candy?
[24:10.04]Is there a good candy one?
[24:11.20]I've been eating a shitload of candy lately.
[24:13.67]Should I do a candy or something?
[24:16.17]What do you think?
[24:17.71]I've been eating a lot of candy.
[24:19.03]I've been really into candy lately.
[24:22.92]Do alcohol?
[24:24.64]I could do that.
[24:25.02]I don't even need a tier list.
[24:26.08]Vodka, S. Everything else, fucking, like, F. Besides, like, whiskey, like, an A. Beer, F. Wine, like, A. There you go.
[24:37.73]Is there a good candy one?
[24:39.33]You did candy in 2020.
[24:42.79]Okay, so it's been about two years.
[24:44.13]I don't remember what I did.
[24:45.09]So, is there a good candy one?
[24:51.26]Give me a good candy one.
[24:58.12]TF2 unusual hats.
[24:59.13]I don't even know.
[25:00.13]Guys, I've seen like three unusual hats my whole life.
[25:04.93]Have you eaten much candy since then?
[25:06.21]Yeah, I think so.
[25:07.29]There's a candy tier list right here.
[25:10.21]Let's check it out.
[25:12.73]Vodka?
[25:13.13]Yeah, because vodka goes with almost everything.
[25:15.93]That's the only reason why.
[25:18.66]I like whiskey too, but vodka is easier to drink.
[25:22.64]I don't really drink that much hard alcohol.
[25:24.26]Usually it's just wine or champagne or something, right?
[25:28.19]Okay, candy.
[25:31.36]Oh, let me put it on.
[25:35.64]Okay.
[25:41.39]Okay.
[25:41.65]How long is this?
[25:42.19]Is it going to take like an hour?
[25:43.01]This is going to take like a fucking hour, isn't it?
[25:57.56]Uh, this doesn't feel complete.
[26:01.36]Is this complete?
[26:01.86]What do you guys think?
[26:05.86]Is there more on here that should be on here?
[26:09.78]No, this looks pretty complete.
[26:10.72]Is this the same one that I did?
[26:12.74]I think this looks kind of complete.
[26:16.08]What's it missing?
[26:24.99]Looks pretty good.
[26:27.17]Looks good.
[26:28.93]Okay.
[26:30.13]Let's start with the easy stuff that I know.
[26:37.25]Greasy's PCs are an A. Although eating more than like... What's touching my leg?
[26:43.37]Honestly, God, there was like a fucking thing on my leg.
[26:45.34]What was that?
[26:45.80]Oh, okay.
[26:56.61]Okay, Reese's Pieces are pretty good.
[26:58.93]I would say they're A. I would say Twizzlers are D or F. D is fine, we can use it as F. Twizzlers are gross.
[27:07.15]There's only one kind of Twizzler I like, and it's the ones where you peel the Twizzlers.
[27:13.06]Those are pretty good.
[27:14.42]Bazooka Gum, if you can find one that isn't as hard as a rock, I'd say that's a pretty solid B.
[27:24.36]A hundred grand.
[27:25.28]I remember the commercials where they'd say, what would you do with a hundred grand?
[27:28.12]Oh, I'd eat it.
[27:28.92]So that gets a B for like funny commercial.
[27:30.90]No, it doesn't.
[27:34.28]Let's just get this out of the way.
[27:36.46]Reese's is the best candy.
[27:37.90]Reese's are the best candy.
[27:41.68]There's no, I don't, honestly, I don't think there's any argument to be made.
[27:43.98]There really isn't.
[27:49.38]No, I don't, there is no argument to make.
[27:53.50]It's the best candy.
[27:54.60]It's the best chocolate candy.
[27:56.98]You know what else?
[27:58.43]I'm gonna give Reese's a little bit of credit here.
[28:01.03]They also haven't changed shit.
[28:04.45]There's been no new recipe for Reese's.
[28:06.25]It's the same goddamn shit it was like 50 years ago.
[28:10.45]Think about it.
[28:11.23]Think about the things that you think about that go like, oh man, remember back in the 90s when like it tasted better and they used like fucking whatever?
[28:17.92]It's the same.
[28:20.94]This has not changed in like fucking 40 years.
[28:25.63]Sour Patch Kids.
[28:29.23]Nah, I don't like these.
[28:31.75]I like eating like one or two of them.
[28:35.75]I like them, but I only want like two.
[28:42.40]I really only want like two.
[28:46.58]I'll keep it in B for now.
[28:48.58]I know they're good.
[28:49.28]I like them, but I just don't want to eat like a whole bag.
[28:53.84]Bubble tape is A. If you can find it.
[28:59.06]It's amazing.
[29:00.12]Although it does have like the weird like baby powder shit on it.
[29:10.15]I'll keep it here for now.
[29:11.11]I love it though.
[29:14.17]Uh, sweet tarts.
[29:15.27]Are these the, yep, those are S. Absolutely 100%.
[29:19.55]Sweet tarts are so delicious.
[29:20.81]They're so yummy.
[29:24.10]I can eat a sweet tart and it's the same exact thing.
[29:26.80]Sweet tarts are Sour Patch Kids, but good.
[29:31.56]Sweet tarts are like sour candy, Sour Patch Kids.
[29:35.44]They're just like a better version in my brain than a Sour Patch Kid.
[29:44.06]I just feel that way.
[29:45.72]Fun Dip is also kind of... I can only do it once or twice.
[29:49.02]It's good, but I don't know.
[29:49.72]I'll keep it a B for now.
[29:52.50]Um...
[29:54.66]Mike and Ike's... I don't... There's just no reason to eat them.
[30:01.51]Original Tootsie Rolls.
[30:02.51]These are... Eh, they're not... I don't know.
[30:05.25]They're kind of just... Heath Bar is like a C or a B, but if it's part of ice cream, it's S. Like, Heath Bar Crunch Ice Cream, S+.
[30:19.56]I'd say it's probably...
[30:23.47]I'm gonna give it a high B. I like it.
[30:27.01]Warheads, again, I just like sweet tarts better.
[30:29.33]I don't know.
[30:30.14]They're good, but you only eat one.
[30:31.88]After you eat more than one, it's like you're gonna fucking... I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
[30:34.10]I'll put it at C. Kit Kats are up high.
[30:41.42]Number around A. I'll fix it.
[30:44.24]Andy's Mints, S. S+.
[30:45.70]Tried and true for like 500 years.
[30:54.64]I may have changed my opinion on this I don't remember what I gave this like two or three years ago but Andy's mints have been tried and true delicious perfect it's a perfect serving size you only need like one of them one or two just one or two that's it and it's completely satisfying it's a perfect combination of chocolate mint it's perfect it's s
[31:17.87]In fact, now that I know what's right next to Sweet Tarts here, this is A. This is only for the most prestigious candy.
[31:24.83]And Andes are up there.
[31:25.61]As, as, probably, you know what?
[31:27.69]No.
[31:28.19]How dare you?
[31:28.91]Even... Get your, get your hand away from there!
[31:34.64]How dare you?
[31:36.90]I like just reached, I just got like slapped by like mom going to get like the food.
[31:42.66]Okay.
[31:44.01]Three Musketeers.
[31:45.13]I'm going to shock a lot of you with this one.
[31:46.61]This is a high A. The fluffy, the fluffy nougat in the middle.
[31:52.57]Oh, it's so good.
[31:55.35]It's so fluffy and so like just puffy and fluffy.
[31:58.82]It's so yummy.
[32:00.60]It's so good.
[32:01.60]I love it.
[32:02.02]A plus.
[32:05.30]It's literally air.
[32:09.74]What are these?
[32:10.12]Are these, are these, what are these?
[32:14.23]Gummies?
[32:15.69]What are those?
[32:19.03]These are Swedish fish?
[32:19.81]They are Swedish fish, aren't they?
[32:21.67]F. I don't get this.
[32:26.53]I don't think I ever will.
[32:28.18]I don't understand why people like these.
[32:32.08]I really don't like them at all.
[32:35.12]They're just kind of slimy and chewy.
[32:38.76]I don't get it.
[32:40.30]I honestly just don't get it.
[32:44.51]I know, that's the worst take I've had.
[32:47.41]But man, these are just not good.
[32:48.59]This is not good.
[32:52.59]Mm-mm.
[32:54.13]They're fruity.
[32:55.55]Yeah, but I would rather just have gummy bears.
[32:58.35]Are the Haribo gummy bears on here?
[33:00.09]Because they're just a way better version of these.
[33:02.94]Like a hundred times better.
[33:04.30]I mean like one hundred times better.
[33:05.86]It's like the same thing.
[33:10.72]In my head.
[33:15.12]Are they on?
[33:15.56]There they are.
[33:16.04]Yeah.
[33:16.42]Yeah.
[33:16.88]Haribo gummy bears are... Wait, are these the big ones?
[33:18.84]I'm gonna take these as just, like, the little ones.
[33:21.70]These are perfect.
[33:24.92]Yeah, these are, like, A. These are great.
[33:29.72]Yeah.
[33:30.46]Swedish fish, you chew... You chew them up, and then after, like, 10 to 20 minutes, you realize that you have this, like... Like, weird, like, red, like, cement paste that's aligning all of your gums.
[33:43.19]And it's, like...
[33:46.88]No, I don't know.
[33:47.70]I don't like it.
[33:48.14]I don't think there's any list that you'll ever see that has peeps higher than an F4D.
[33:59.13]If somebody genuinely had peeps up here, I'm a little concerned.
[34:03.71]I think I'm concerned about them.
[34:05.74]I don't think anybody puts these up here.
[34:07.76]I could see how people could put them like here, but an S?
[34:11.42]I mean, I don't know what you're talking about.
[34:13.34]How would that be possible?
[34:17.78]No.
[34:17.96]I don't think anybody puts them up there.
[34:21.96]Peeps are A. Yeah, but not S. If you put Peeps in S tier.
[34:24.37]I don't know about that.
[34:26.37]Dots F. Okay, all you Swedish fish andies.
[34:32.41]What's the difference between dots and fish besides the squished mold that is the fish mold for the candy?
[34:41.59]What's the difference?
[34:45.50]Explain.
[34:48.33]You all say dots are the worst candy.
[34:49.87]Everybody knows dots is the worst candy.
[34:52.21]But Swedish fish are just like flattened out dots.
[34:57.37]Huh?
[35:02.23]Shape is important.
[35:04.39]Do you like dinosaur chicken nuggets more than regular chicken nuggets?
[35:10.60]What are you talking about?
[35:19.64]These also suck.
[35:20.56]It just takes forever.
[35:22.62]I don't like the appeal.
[35:23.34]They're better than Peeps.
[35:25.10]No, they're not.
[35:25.80]Actually, I'd rather eat a Peep.
[35:27.60]It's just no.
[35:30.56]Who is going to spit this shit out and eat it later?
[35:34.36]Do you rinse it under the sink?
[35:37.84]After you suck on this thing for like three hours, do you spit it out and like rinse it under the sink and put it in like a bag?
[35:43.68]I don't know.
[35:48.48]Twix.
[35:49.08]That's going up here.
[35:53.01]I've had Twix before that were really, like, pillowy and delicious.
[35:57.35]But I have to be honest, I've had Twix before that were kind of stale.
[36:01.85]They, like, it's just something's off.
[36:03.37]You know what I mean?
[36:04.63]Something's off.
[36:06.85]I've had that experience a few times.
[36:14.20]Razzlers?
[36:14.78]Holy shit.
[36:15.36]I just, like, I remember these being good.
[36:16.74]Sweet Tarts.
[36:17.12]They're on the same level.
[36:21.75]This is the candy necklace?
[36:22.65]That's up there, too.
[36:23.37]Pretty like a high B. York peppermint patties?
[36:26.77]That's up there, too.
[36:28.13]These are phenomenal.
[36:29.81]It's that perfect, like, ice.
[36:31.42]Okay, I think of a commercial.
[36:33.58]When you bite into a York peppermint patty, and it's like... I hear that.
[36:38.20]I hear, like, a... And I think of, like, snow being around me.
[36:42.66]It's perfect.
[36:46.73]Airheads are alright.
[36:48.03]They're...
[36:51.40]I don't know if I'd put airheads... Maybe I'd put them, like, here.
[36:57.90]I don't think I would rather... I'd rather have a Kit Kat than an airhead.
[37:01.45]I'm way more chocolate-oriented than I am, like, sweet, fruit, sugary kind of oriented.
[37:08.71]Look at this list.
[37:10.89]With the exception of, like, sweet tarts, like, most of my stuff up here is, like, chocolate mint.
[37:15.63]Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate.
[37:17.47]It's alright.
[37:18.81]It's alright.
[37:19.63]I like it.
[37:21.85]Why is this even on here?
[37:22.61]I don't even know what a Baby Ruth tastes like.
[37:28.41]I just noticed a shitload of peanuts, so I don't think I've had it.
[37:34.78]Lifesavers are pretty good.
[37:37.90]I actually, it's not on here, I don't think, but I prefer the, like, mint, spearmint Lifesavers over the fruity ones.
[37:44.63]Can I pretend that these are the mint ones?
[37:47.55]You know what I'm talking about?
[37:48.19]The little individually packaged spearmint ones.
[37:53.44]Oh, those are amazing.
[37:55.12]Those are so good.
[37:57.80]The mint ones are better.
[37:58.46]Okay, I'm just going to pretend these are the mint ones.
[38:05.20]This is, okay, this is that candy that's in that group of candy that's at every gas station.
[38:11.45]That's in the bags and it's like just all the weird oddity like circus shit.
[38:17.39]Right?
[38:19.87]The gas station has this one row of just weird bag candies.
[38:25.94]And I'm not a big fan.
[38:30.14]Circus peanuts.
[38:31.64]Yeah, circus peanuts are okay.
[38:33.76]I actually kind of like eating one.
[38:36.34]And going like, yeah, I remember that's what that is.
[38:38.03]And then I never eat another one ever again.
[38:42.91]I don't think they don't belong down here.
[38:49.20]Hmm, okay.
[38:54.04]Just general Hershey's bar.
[38:57.16]I mean, it's part of one of my favorite desserts ever, which is s'mores.
[39:01.53]But by itself, I mean, there's other things I would rather have.
[39:09.47]A Hershey bar is fine.
[39:12.15]It's fine.
[39:13.65]But if you have KitKat available that's on the same rack, I'm gonna get KitKat.
[39:19.27]If you have three Musketeers and Hershey's right next to each other, I'm never going to take the Hershey bar, ever.
[39:27.40]But if you were like, hey man, do you want some chocolate?
[39:30.32]I got Hershey's.
[39:30.88]I'd be like, yeah, sure, that's fine.
[39:32.56]Sounds good.
[39:34.91]That sounds fine.
[39:37.25]But I don't think, it's probably C.
[39:41.66]Um, hot tamales.
[39:43.12]This is like the hot cinnamon candy.
[39:46.94]I'd actually probably rather eat this than candy corn.
[39:51.27]Cinnamon, like, can't, no thanks.
[39:52.85]Uh-uh.
[40:01.38]S'mores are the only place Hershey's are good.
[40:04.06]Yeah.
[40:05.66]I mean, you're right, but it's one of the reasons why it's so good, right?
[40:09.06]What are these?
[40:11.25]Are these nerds?
[40:13.37]S. Nerds are S. And again, another reason why, you're probably seeing a pattern up here.
[40:23.22]The nerds formula has never changed.
[40:26.04]It's the same formula it's been since like 1900.
[40:30.68]Since like 1830 or whatever, when these were invented, they have never changed.
[40:34.54]They've been exactly the same.
[40:36.52]And they're really good.
[40:38.72]They're gross.
[40:41.07]I like them.
[40:41.77]I think they're good.
[40:45.13]Ring pop is fine.
[40:46.23]I probably put it over here.
[40:49.71]It's just like a lollipop, whatever.
[40:51.39]It's a lollipop that's shaped in an interesting way.
[40:55.71]They're okay.
[40:57.65]Fireball.
[40:58.11]Again, gross cinnamon candy.
[41:00.99]That's like just hot cinnamon fireball kind of... No, thank you.
[41:08.02]Milky Way is just Three Musketeer, but way worse.
[41:13.05]But it's not that bad.
[41:14.95]It's good.
[41:16.73]It's just not... It doesn't even come close to me.
[41:19.81]Doesn't even come close.
[41:24.01]Three Musketeers are just kind of like a whipped up, kind of fluffy version, and it's way better.
[41:31.14]Hmm.
[41:34.90]Is Pocky...
[41:36.66]Is that Pocky?
[41:38.13]No, these are candy cigarettes.
[41:43.29]Okay, these are gross.
[41:44.33]These are actually really gross.
[41:45.77]Have you ever eaten a candy cigarette?
[41:49.39]It kind of reminds me of, like, what plaster would taste like.
[41:55.88]I think it... No, no thanks.
[42:03.99]Pixie Stix?
[42:04.91]These are alright.
[42:06.87]I'm going to put Pixie Stix next to Fun Dip because they're literally the exact same thing.
[42:10.81]There is no difference besides a stick that you lick.
[42:14.47]Nothing else is different.
[42:16.05]I already did, though.
[42:16.55]Some of these are going to be hard to place.
[42:24.32]I would say Starburst is S, but I don't know.
[42:27.02]They kind of fell off for me.
[42:28.00]They kind of fell way down.
[42:31.48]Yeah, they fell way down for me.
[42:33.92]know why something about it something I think something about it it's not really I don't really care uh smiters are great I actually really enjoy these is it a though it's probably b these are the same to me
[42:55.80]I would put Smarties, Candy Necklace, and Pez right next to each other.
[43:00.54]They're in the same genre of video game kind of candy.
[43:05.06]You know what I mean?
[43:05.54]They're in the same exact genre.
[43:08.80]Where's Pez?
[43:09.36]There it is.
[43:13.72]I think Pez is probably the best.
[43:16.47]But to me, they're in the same flavor profile.
[43:19.29]They're the same movie genre.
[43:23.24]Like, this is Jason, this is Freddy, and this is, like, Michael Myers.
[43:27.04]You know what I mean?
[43:27.66]It's like... I'm getting the same thing out of it.
[43:33.83]Nestle Crunch.
[43:34.51]I feel like it's been a while.
[43:38.75]But I do remember eating it.
[43:40.66]I'm thinking it was good.
[43:42.72]I think Crackle might be better.
[43:45.32]Is Crackle on here?
[43:46.46]Can I pretend this is Crackle?
[43:49.82]I think Crackle actually might be better.
[44:00.13]What the fuck is Crackle?
[44:01.99]Crackle!
[44:02.31]Is it the red wrapper?
[44:04.45]I think Crackle is better.
[44:05.73]But I think this is still good.
[44:06.83]I don't think it's better than KitKat, but it's close.
[44:11.32]No, it's not.
[44:13.00]Actually, you know what it is?
[44:13.68]No, it is.
[44:14.26]Actually, it is.
[44:15.16]I think it is.
[44:17.72]Alright, like cookie dough bites.
[44:19.17]I don't think I've ever eaten these.
[44:21.09]Fruit Gushers.
[44:24.91]Is this like a candy...
[44:29.66]Are Gushers candy or are they fruit snack?
[44:32.12]Right?
[44:32.32]Is that kind of a difference, isn't there?
[44:35.93]I don't like think Gushers are candy.
[44:41.13]I like them a lot, though.
[44:45.12]I don't like that you open the bag and you go take one out and, like, you get the, like, the, like, streamer wall.
[44:54.71]You know what I mean?
[44:55.35]With all, like, the hexagons that are, like, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[44:57.89]You get, like, the, like, hexagon streamer wall when you pull it out.
[45:02.67]Um, it's all connected and shit.
[45:06.74]I'd like to eat one at a time.
[45:11.90]But they're good.
[45:18.06]I'd rather have a gummy bear, but I actually do like these.
[45:20.36]I think they're good.
[45:21.76]I know that's a gross take for a lot of people.
[45:23.18]They really don't like that.
[45:25.52]People think Gushers are gross.
[45:28.22]When was the last time you had them?
[45:32.67]Lemonheads are horrible, aren't they?
[45:37.27]But they're good.
[45:38.07]They're like, they're here.
[45:39.27]It's like, this is like the same thing in my brain.
[45:45.06]Any candy where you put it in your mouth and you go like,
[45:50.15]It's like the same thing.
[45:51.32]They're the same movie.
[45:53.12]It's the same genre.
[45:55.62]It fits in the same spot.
[46:00.09]I think they're okay.
[46:00.97]They're chewy, aren't they?
[46:03.99]These are the ones where they're yellow, and then when you suck all the juice off them, they turn into white, chewy little balls, right?
[46:15.73]I got it right.
[46:17.47]After you suck on them for a little while, they turn into these little tiny white squishy, chewy things.
[46:23.40]Soft outside, hard inside.
[46:24.82]Oh, I had it backwards.
[46:27.20]I haven't had these in a while, but I do remember thinking they were pretty good.
[46:31.26]Bob Stoppers.
[46:31.82]I haven't really had them.
[46:33.91]Tootsie Pops are like Hershey bars.
[46:36.01]They're fine.
[46:37.33]I would rather have something else.
[46:41.15]Where are Tootsie Rolls?
[46:43.15]Did I put them up here?
[46:45.35]I mean, they're like... These are better than Tootsie Rolls because they're Tootsie Pops, so there's like a... There's more complex flavors going on, but I still would rather have something else.
[47:00.38]Jolly Ranchers.
[47:00.97]These are up here.
[47:03.03]I'd say somewhere in A. Gummy Bears are a little... Well, that depends.
[47:06.99]What do you want out of your candy experience?
[47:09.28]Do you want to just eat something and have it disappear and like, that's it?
[47:11.94]That was delicious.
[47:12.62]Move on to the next thing.
[47:13.96]Or do you want a little bit longer lasting experience?
[47:16.96]Do you want to eat something that's going to last you more than one second, 10 seconds?
[47:22.36]These are the same to me.
[47:23.86]This is just like extended delayed release tablets.
[47:27.58]These are like, let's go right now.
[47:30.46]Yeah, this is extended release tablets of the same thing.
[47:33.76]So I like them both.
[47:35.17]It depends on how I feel.
[47:39.11]We got, uh, Blo-Pop, which are way better than Tootsie Pops.
[47:44.81]I can tell you I have not had one in a long time.
[47:51.08]But I do remember them being phenomenal.
[47:52.86]Been a while.
[47:54.76]Probably better than Gushers.
[47:58.16]Charleston Chew.
[48:01.22]What a legend.
[48:04.00]Uh, where's, where's, speaking of Charleston Chew, where the hell is it?
[48:07.40]Because that's up here.
[48:09.20]Where's Charleston Chew?
[48:12.42]Nope.
[48:14.46]I already know what this is.
[48:15.18]It's like the gross coconut thing.
[48:19.22]Dum Dums?
[48:21.24]I'd rather have a Dum Dum than a Blow Pop.
[48:23.40]They're just easier.
[48:25.44]Quicker.
[48:29.82]Yeah, Charleston Chews are incredible.
[48:31.58]In the freezer.
[48:32.52]They have to be from the freezer, though.
[48:33.54]They have to be.
[48:35.25]If a Charleston Chew is in the freezer, it's here.
[48:38.91]Somewhere in this area.
[48:40.03]I don't know exactly where, but it's here.
[48:41.21]Lifesavers are not that high.
[48:45.11]This is going to need some re-combobulating here.
[48:49.01]Uh, Snickers are tried and true.
[48:51.51]It's kind of exactly what you're looking for.
[48:54.08]Test of time.
[48:54.82]Been around for like 100 years.
[48:56.84]They've never changed it.
[48:58.80]It's always just always good.
[49:03.15]Yeah, just always good.
[49:04.79]Especially the little ones.
[49:06.47]Oh my god, I just like fell down.
[49:12.23]The little Snickers, the little individual little squares, I think are better than the bars.
[49:18.53]Because they make sure that in the little squares, it's the exact ratio of everything you want.
[49:24.82]It's a perfect singular bite of candy.
[49:30.32]The bar of Snickers could, it's kind of, you never know what's going to be in there.
[49:33.68]You don't know what the ratio's like.
[49:35.52]The little ones, oh yeah, you know exactly what you're getting in there, absolutely.
[49:40.27]They're up here.
[49:45.79]Thinking about making a change here.
[49:47.13]We'll see.
[49:49.25]M&M's, they're alright.
[49:51.43]They're fine, but this is just, if they're regular M&M's, then like, whatever.
[49:54.47]Peanut butter M&M's are up here.
[50:02.28]Regular M&Ms, they're reliable.
[50:08.88]Okay, the chocolate inside of an M&M is better than the chocolate in the Hershey's.
[50:15.39]Like this, you just get like an upgraded experience with the candy on the outside.
[50:21.01]Once you get in there, the chocolate's better.
[50:23.03]It's a better chocolate.
[50:23.93]It tastes better.
[50:26.21]M&Ms minis are S tier.
[50:27.81]Oh, you better believe it.
[50:29.17]You better believe it.
[50:34.08]I think this is probably around here.
[50:38.79]Again, these fit in the same category.
[50:40.37]Like, do I want the Reese's flavor or do I want the M&M's flavor?
[50:44.85]One's not better than the other for me.
[50:48.38]Razzlers, get out of here.
[50:49.22]You don't belong up there.
[50:52.08]Bubble tape doesn't either.
[50:58.37]Skittles are like, they fell off.
[51:01.29]Just like Starburst did.
[51:02.59]They're actually in the same place for me.
[51:06.54]It's just... They kind of fell off for me.
[51:10.64]I'm not a big fan anymore.
[51:13.44]They're almost like too sugary.
[51:15.92]I know that like I have literally pure sugar up here, right?
[51:19.66]But something about Skittles, they're almost like too sweet.
[51:22.64]It's like too sugary.
[51:24.90]I don't know why.
[51:25.46]Something about it.
[51:27.41]I guess you could say this is the exact same thing, but even these taste different than this.
[51:32.85]It's like a different kind of sweetness.
[51:37.55]I think these are the same, so I'm going to put them here.
[51:41.45]Lifesavers, I'm going to... Where are Lifesavers?
[51:46.67]If they're in A, it's a mistake.
[51:49.83]Where are they?
[51:50.13]Where are they?
[51:53.85]Didn't I put other Lifesavers up here?
[51:57.24]Where'd they go?
[51:58.25]Bottom of A?
[51:59.05]Oh, right, okay.
[52:01.01]Uh, wait, we're pretending that these are mint.
[52:03.23]Right?
[52:05.23]These are like the spearmint ones?
[52:06.07]That's what we're pretending.
[52:09.13]Um... These are tropical ones.
[52:12.27]The tropical ones are actually pretty good.
[52:17.57]I would put them somewhere here.
[52:19.06]They're okay.
[52:20.64]I would... They're good.
[52:22.90]Hershey's Kisses are better than Hershey's.
[52:24.56]Again, it's like... It's kind of weird.
[52:28.05]Because the chocolate in a Hershey's Kiss tastes better than a Hershey bar.
[52:32.65]I don't know why or how.
[52:35.18]I don't get it.
[52:37.88]And it's way better somehow.
[52:39.22]It is way better.
[52:41.58]Why?
[52:43.66]Why is that?
[52:48.86]I can't give you a reason why.
[52:51.74]You just said shape doesn't matter.
[52:55.17]No, I told you that these are the same thing, just different shapes.
[52:58.15]I also think they're gross.
[52:59.51]I don't think these are gross.
[53:01.52]I think these are... I think this chocolate's good.
[53:05.32]I think chocolate's good.
[53:06.20]I think these are gross.
[53:08.02]Yeah, they can be different shapes as long as I think they taste good.
[53:10.18]That's fine.
[53:14.32]They belong right here, right in the middle.
[53:17.49]Probably overfunded.
[53:18.31]Bazooka... What is bazooka... What is this doing up here?
[53:25.61]Yeah, it's called you chew up the gum for five seconds, read the comic book and spit it out.
[53:29.87]Why was this up here?
[53:35.07]But that was, those comic books, those comics were fire.
[53:39.92]How cool was that?
[53:41.68]A tiny little comic with like three or four, five panels.
[53:44.72]That's fucking awesome.
[53:46.18]What a cool thing.
[53:49.38]That was really, the wrapper was a comic book.
[53:51.94]Um, excuse me.
[53:53.66]I was wrong.
[53:56.10]Pop rocks are fun for a second where you're like, oh yeah, remember these?
[53:59.17]And you do it and you go, okay, I won't eat these for like another three or four years.
[54:03.87]They're alright.
[54:07.75]You can't put... Okay.
[54:08.95]Some people are going to put this in S. How do you put something in S that you know you're not going to eat?
[54:16.51]More than like once every two or three decades.
[54:22.75]You know what I mean?
[54:23.85]Sure, they're really cool.
[54:25.85]It's a crazy experience.
[54:26.97]Like it's, wow, look at the pop rocks.
[54:28.63]And it's, oh my God, crunch, crunch.
[54:30.93]But if I'm only going to do this like once every fucking five years, why can I put it up here?
[54:35.52]Like I said, why, why would I put it up there?
[54:38.26]It's, it's cool, but it's not, I, I have eaten these.
[54:46.58]I mean, I ate like five of these literally yesterday.
[54:49.69]So that's why they're up here.
[54:54.55]This is a funny experience to have, but I don't think it's a great candy to eat all the time.
[54:58.34]These are the wax bottles.
[55:03.14]Again, same deal.
[55:05.56]You're going to remember that the wax bottles exist.
[55:08.42]You're going to go, oh, dude.
[55:10.95]Oh, my God.
[55:13.09]Whoa, oh, yeah, dude, remember?
[55:14.75]Do you remember that?
[55:16.80]And then you go, both gonna go, okay, we're not doing that for another decade.
[55:20.58]We're not doing that again.
[55:22.00]We're not doing that ever again.
[55:23.12]Like, we're gonna do it once, and then forget it exists for like another five years, till we remember to do it again.
[55:28.41]They belong in the same place.
[55:32.79]And they're somehow better than Starburst and Skittles.
[55:35.65]But that experience is cooler than, yeah.
[55:37.45]Yep, I think so.
[55:42.06]Almond Joy, mm-mm.
[55:46.89]I really don't, I really don't like these.
[55:51.03]I don't like them.
[55:53.14]I think they're better, these are probably better than, yeah, than all this fucking dog shit.
[56:00.08]You know it's tough to, like, do these?
[56:02.56]Somebody said earlier, like, you're ruining sponsorship opportunities.
[56:08.50]If, like, Twizzlers, for any reason, ever, and I'm not saying this is ever going to happen, but if any of these companies were ever like, hey, man, we should, you want to, like, work together?
[56:17.63]All they have to do, wow, these are all dog shit.
[56:24.53]These are dog shit.
[56:25.79]You know what I mean?
[56:27.32]Like, I gotta be careful.
[56:28.38]These are not... Waited to my palate for a moment.
[56:38.13]They're all one company, don't worry.
[56:39.76]That's true.
[56:42.76]True, true.
[56:44.76]That's true.
[56:45.22]Alright, Laffy Taffy is actually, holy shit, this is the pink Laffy Taffy?
[56:50.68]I'm trying to remember what it tastes like.
[56:54.70]It's like a creamy, weird, like, strawberry fake flavoring.
[56:58.94]And it's delicious, isn't it?
[57:00.82]It's, like, fantastic.
[57:04.38]I, like, know what this tastes like.
[57:10.73]Let me... Yeah.
[57:12.63]Hold on.
[57:12.87]I'm getting it.
[57:16.21]Okay.
[57:18.51]Yep.
[57:19.64]Oh, yeah.
[57:22.36]Oh, yeah.
[57:23.02]That's probably... Oh, that's up here.
[57:25.52]I think so.
[57:27.44]Yeah.
[57:29.38]These are really good.
[57:30.28]I just haven't had one in a while.
[57:32.54]Where's... Like, just saltwater taffy.
[57:35.24]That belongs up here in Nassau.
[57:39.33]These things are fine.
[57:40.59]You eat the paper half the time.
[57:41.72]Whatever.
[57:42.10]No.
[57:43.42]Any candy where you go like this?
[57:46.66]No, it's fine.
[57:47.76]But I don't want it all the time.
[57:54.46]Jelly beans?
[57:57.66]I mean, toasted marshmallow jelly beans are up here.
[58:01.51]But the fact that they kept popcorn in for this long...
[58:06.45]I mean, you go down here.
[58:08.79]Just the fact that these people have put popcorn still in here this many years later.
[58:15.92]What are you thinking?
[58:19.86]Like, what are you thinking?
[58:20.76]Popcorn's the best flavor.
[58:23.10]What are you thinking?
[58:28.29]Popcorn's the best flavor.
[58:29.49]What drugs have seeped into you?
[58:34.74]Popcorn is not the best flavor.
[58:36.62]Popcorn tastes like fucking eggs.
[58:40.14]The popcorn jelly bean tastes like eggs.
[58:43.80]No.
[58:44.80]I'm going to die on this hill.
[58:49.02]Toasted marshmallow is way up here.
[58:51.48]And watermelon.
[58:52.16]So you know what?
[58:55.67]Besides like the egg flavored one.
[58:59.11]I would probably enjoy this more than fondue.
[59:01.11]Or lemon heads.
[59:02.37]I think it's a solid beef.
[59:05.67]Toasted marshmallow one sucks ass.
[59:14.71]That's like literally the only reason to get it.
[59:19.19]That's why you buy the jelly beans.
[59:23.35]What are you on about?
[59:24.93]What are you talking about?
[59:25.93]I can't believe somebody's saying that right now.
[59:28.28]That's crazy to me.
[59:30.70]Whoppers kind of taste like acid.
[59:33.63]Uh, the Whoppers are good, but they taste like they're fucking, something's wrong, like something was wrong in the production.
[59:44.70]But, they do have a, they have a very interesting flavor.
[59:48.66]And if you're really into it, there's been times where I've looked at the Whoppers, kind of at the movie theater counter or whatever, and been like, you know what?
[59:55.18]Let's go.
[59:56.78]Let's do it.
[59:58.06]Let's get it.
[59:59.13]Let's go for it.
[60:02.63]And I'm like, oh yeah, these are fine.
[60:04.47]But they do, they kind of have that weird, like, acidic fucking taste.
[60:08.85]Like, there's something, like, there was way too much of some ingredient that you wanted to remove.
[60:13.67]But I, I think that they're fine.
[60:15.43]I would, I think they're solid.
[60:17.66]Hmm.
[60:18.82]But, are they, they're, mm, they're C. I see.
[60:22.70]In fact, like, these are, like, gimmick fucking things.
[60:24.74]They should be down here.
[60:29.58]They're fine, they taste fine, but they're gimmicks.
[60:31.23]This is a gimmick.
[60:34.75]Who's going to be able to do this at the office?
[60:36.65]You know what I mean?
[60:38.36]This is a gimmick.
[60:39.24]You can't do that at the office.
[60:46.48]Like, these down here.
[60:48.46]One, two, three, four, five.
[60:49.96]You can't do these at the office.
[60:53.52]The guy next door, in the office next door, you're going to do pop rocks?
[60:57.86]And you look over, you peek over the side, and he's like... You can't do that at the office.
[61:11.48]Why not?
[61:15.38]It's not for adults, I know.
[61:17.28]But I'm just saying, you can't do that.
[61:19.29]At the office?
[61:23.81]We already know where Skittles are.
[61:24.77]We're gonna put them both here.
[61:27.37]Milk Duds.
[61:30.29]Oh, Milk Duds are bad.
[61:35.39]But why are these in the same space?
[61:36.85]Why are these occupying the same part of my brain?
[61:42.59]They're like chewy and kind of hard, right?
[61:45.19]Oh, I know Milk Duds.
[61:46.47]Milk Duds are the ones that are unbelievably delicious.
[61:49.59]The chocolate, the like candy chocolate coating on the outside is fucking so good.
[61:52.78]It's like chewy and oh, it's so yummy.
[61:55.18]And then you spit it out when it gets like the weird like gum under the desk consistency.
[62:02.08]Right.
[62:02.34]Okay.
[62:04.66]I mean, these are like A plus in flavor.
[62:07.98]But when they get to that point, they go all the way down here.
[62:11.02]I think I'd probably rather have a Whopper.
[62:12.68]The flavor is phenomenal, though.
[62:13.66]It really is.
[62:14.02]The flavor is phenomenal.
[62:16.72]Okay.
[62:24.37]What are these dots?
[62:25.25]These are the cousin of dots.
[62:28.77]What are these called?
[62:29.25]Like dinkels or something?
[62:30.09]What are these called?
[62:30.75]What are these?
[62:35.34]Gumdrops.
[62:36.76]Oh, mm-mm.
[62:38.34]No, they're like weird dots.
[62:40.38]They're in the same place for me.
[62:45.93]Okay, hold on.
[62:46.51]Is it right?
[62:48.23]I see Andy's Nerds.
[62:50.25]Three Musketeers.
[62:51.99]York Pep and Patty Snickers.
[62:54.69]Farts.
[62:55.87]I'm going to move this.
[62:58.16]I'm going to move this.
[63:03.27]Yeah, I think, wait, yeah.
[63:05.26]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[63:07.04]Let's move this a little bit here.
[63:08.06]Remember, these are mint.
[63:10.26]These are mint.
[63:14.26]This is, I remember this being so good.
[63:15.40]These are, this is fine.
[63:17.40]Milky Way, yeah, that's fine.
[63:19.52]Put this up a little higher.
[63:20.22]Way higher, actually.
[63:22.16]Actually, you know what?
[63:23.00]Fuck that.
[63:25.28]Oh, fuck that, yeah.
[63:26.04]I'd rather have a Heath Bar.
[63:28.46]Maybe not more than a gummy bear.
[63:30.91]Maybe not... Stupid.
[63:32.75]Fucking idiot.
[63:34.55]Idiot.
[63:35.55]Oh yeah, yeah.
[63:39.73]I think that's fine.
[63:44.56]I still think he's an alien for putting Pocky in trash tier.
[63:47.72]Actually, Pocky would be up here for me now.
[63:49.78]I've had a few flavors that I actually really liked.
[63:51.40]There's like a mint chocolate Pocky that is up here.
[63:58.10]I don't really like any of the other ones.
[63:59.94]Here's my old list.
[64:00.90]Okay.
[64:05.47]Haki was on there twice.
[64:06.51]Alright.
[64:08.61]Let's get my old list.
[64:09.79]I think I'm happy with this one.
[64:15.87]What do we got?
[64:16.25]Alright.
[64:24.23]What's going on here?
[64:26.95]Who puts Mr. Goodbar in S tier?
[64:31.10]Why is Mr. Goodbar in S tier?
[64:35.90]Mr. Goodbar?
[64:39.87]What the fuck am I talking about?
[64:41.77]Why is Mr. Goodbar on here twice?
[64:45.55]It's on here two times.
[64:50.58]I don't get it.
[64:55.19]You were pretending it was something else.
[64:56.51]Does anyone remember what it was supposed to be?
[64:58.19]Why would you ever put Mr. Goodbar in S tier?
[65:03.71]It's good, but not S tier.
[65:09.03]Oh, this is an absolutely brainless take.
[65:14.73]Gummy bears are in D. Cadbury eggs are in D. M&Ms are in F. What am I talking about?
[65:25.83]Guys, what am I on about?
[65:29.44]Okay, is Swedish Fish down at F... It better be.
[65:33.60]Sweet Tarts?
[65:35.54]Alright, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[65:36.62]Let's rank this down a little.
[65:41.15]Yeah, alright.
[65:41.63]Sweet Tarts are fine.
[65:42.63]Trolley is in trashed here.
[65:54.51]And I would put it there again.
[65:56.46]I would put it down here again.
[65:59.62]Everyone talking about how I have like a palette of a 10-year-old, and yet I'm getting all this flack for trolly gummy worms being down in like D. Why?
[66:12.73]Excuse me?
[66:16.15]Gummy worms?
[66:19.17]No.
[66:19.37]No.
[66:20.81]Trolley is S. No, it's not.
[66:22.62]It's a gummy worm.
[66:23.12]Gummy worms are like fucking F. They're like D. I don't like them.
[66:27.54]They're down here with like Swedish fucking fish.
[66:32.12]Wait.
[66:32.44]Hold on.
[66:34.08]I'll be fair.
[66:38.50]I'll be fair.
[66:39.28]Relax.
[66:40.34]Relax.
[66:40.70]I'll be fair.
[66:43.26]I've never had a trolley before ever in my life.
[66:46.32]It's just gummy worms are for kids.
[66:47.71]I just didn't ever.
[66:48.53]I never bought them.
[66:54.51]Eat a trolley on stream.
[66:58.21]Gummy worms were like, oh, ew.
[67:01.01]He's got a worm in his mouth.
[67:02.72]That's for children.
[67:04.72]But I never bought them.
[67:10.37]Everything that I have besides Nerds is an adult beverage of candies, okay?
[67:16.24]It's an adult beverage of candies.
[67:17.86]Reese's is like the whiskey.
[67:19.92]No, Reese's is like the whiskey.
[67:22.46]Andy's is like the peppermint schnapps.
[67:26.82]Three Musketeers is like a really good fucking wine.
[67:29.66]York Peppermint Patty.
[67:31.32]These are like adult beverages.
[67:36.74]A Snickers bar.
[67:37.72]Oh.
[67:39.08]That's like, these are like aged to perfection.
[67:43.50]Everyone making fun of my 10-year-old palette and saying, where's Trolley?
[67:47.78]Where's the gummy worms?
[67:50.50]Bubble tape.
[67:52.58]It's six feet of bubble gum.
[67:54.23]For adults, not kids.
[67:56.47]I remember the commercial.
[67:58.31]Six feet of bubble gum.
[67:59.53]For you, not kids.
[68:03.67]I saw it a million times.
[68:04.61]It was on TV all the time.
[68:08.31]You're already in mine?
[68:08.99]Okay, I've never had a trolley.
[68:09.85]I'll eat a trolley on stream.
[68:12.21]And I'll change my opinion if it's good.
[68:14.55]Gummy worms are for men.
[68:18.45]What?
[68:19.13]It's not for men?
[68:20.45]No, it's not?
[68:21.75]How is a gummy worm for men?
[68:33.82]It's a man-sized gummy worm.
[68:37.75]Gummy worms are for men.
[68:39.97]Why are you putting gummy worms in the same category as like a fucking like brisket sandwich?
[68:51.84]Executives eat Trolley.

[71:28.30]Okay, how about this?
[71:30.84]No, that's... I don't think I can get that by tomorrow.
[71:34.19]Should I go up against my own bullshit and eat all the things that are in C&D?
[71:40.18]Should we do a Face Your Bullshit stream?
[71:44.24]Where I eat all these things that I have in a bad category and tell you how I really feel?
[71:52.79]And you have to eat them in a suit.
[72:01.17]Toblerone is S+.
[72:02.03]It can't even fit on this list.
[72:04.57]Toblerone is like stratosphere.
[72:07.44]It's the best candy in the world, but it's just not on here.
[72:09.16]It's not fair.
[72:10.22]It's not fair for Toblerone to be on here.
[72:11.76]Alright, how about this?
[72:13.82]Okay, this is what we're gonna do.
[72:17.14]We're gonna do a Face the Bullshit stream.
[72:19.43]Can I do it tomorrow?
[72:22.33]What's tomorrow?
[72:26.71]Okay, can you give me a day to prepare?
[72:32.75]I want to make sure I can get a bunch of these.
[72:34.96]I'll do a Face the Bullshit stream.
[72:39.32]Give me a day or two to prepare this.

[72:52.77]I don't think I can get it by tomorrow.
[72:56.47]I'll wear a suit and it'll be called Face the Bullshit stream.

[73:11.25]I'm gonna go through these and figure out all the things that I fucking said that were gross.
[73:18.17]You're gonna buy every single candy at the store in a suit.
[73:24.60]Do they make little versions of this shit?
[73:26.34]I don't wanna, like, eat one and then, like, not want it.
[73:31.26]You need a popcorn jelly bean.
[73:32.70]Ah, fuck.
[73:35.10]You can get 95% of these at like Walmart or a gas station?
[73:37.88]Okay.
[73:40.58]Alright, alright.
[73:43.81]We'll make this work.
[73:48.94]So, tomorrow, I'm going to scour the world for all these things that I said that I hate, or think are gross, or think I'm so high and mighty on, and I will give you my real honest opinions on them.
[74:00.45]I will not fuck around.
[74:03.61]And I'm going to do it in a soup.
[74:05.87]It's going to be like a fucking telephone on the desk.

[74:18.79]All I ask is that you don't fuck around.
[74:20.57]Alright, I'll pull up all... I'll figure it out.
[74:27.85]But yeah, we'll open up... If you have any recommendations, by the way, we have the recommended channel in Discord.
[74:34.72]Maybe I can work with the mods.
[74:38.60]We'll get a good list of a bunch of stuff.
[74:42.08]This is going to be the worst stream of the year.
[74:55.91]What if he pukes?
[74:56.89]What if I puke on camera?
[74:58.41]Can I puke?
[75:02.51]Yeah, it's going to be called Face the Bullshit.
[75:06.50]In a top hat.
[75:08.24]With candles.
[75:10.98]Alright, let me just make sure I can even get all this gross stuff.

[75:55.92]I'll do them all!
[75:56.76]All my tier lists!
[75:57.72]Maybe besides the fast food ones, because that, I don't want to, like... Alright, here's what I don't want to do.
[76:01.82]I don't want to, like, buy a bunch of food and, like, waste a bunch of food.
[76:04.99]Right?
[76:06.27]That'll be for, like, a different day, maybe.
[76:08.61]We're talking, like, shelf-stable stuff.
[76:10.65]Because even if I don't like it, I can, like, roll it up and, like, eat it over the course of, like, a year.
[76:14.81]So... I'm not going to buy, like, fucking 30 pieces of fast food and take 10 bites of everything and then throw it all away.
[76:21.95]I'm not going to do that.
[76:22.97]So...

[79:43.13]But what if I don't like it?
[79:43.95]I'm gonna have to like eat like gross cereal?
[79:49.56]I mean, I'm going to eat all this stuff because it's going to be... I don't want to just waste a bunch of food.
[79:54.30]So if I buy, for instance, what is down here at the very bottom?
[80:00.74]Like multi-grain Cheerios.
[80:03.06]Oh, I don't want to eat those, but I... I don't want to eat multi-grain Cheerios.
[80:16.18]Could you donate it?
[80:18.06]Okay, if I don't get through everything, then yeah.
[80:23.88]But, I mean, I'm gonna be opening most of this stuff.
[80:26.14]I'm gonna have to eat it.
[80:29.16]So, if I can track down the Sour Patch Kids cereal, I'm gonna have to open the bag and eat it.
[80:37.67]I can't, like, I'm not gonna... I'm gonna have to eventually, over the course of like a year, eat that Sour Patch Kids cereal.
[80:47.25]They're a single serving box.
