[01:06.79]So if you're wondering This is just gonna be a little maybe like an hour like less than an hour maybe like something like an hour or two maybe Off schedule random hold on let me explain what's going on here Everyone I'm sure you notice what's happening.
[01:25.87]You probably notice the screen Your chat is blowing up with all kinds of shit.
[01:29.96]Hold on a second.
[01:30.60]Oh
[01:33.43]It's literally just a snake of emotes.
[01:39.44]It's just like a PogChamp snake.
[01:52.37]Alright, give me a second, hold on.
[02:00.15]Just gonna play a little Redeemer.
[02:03.19]Actually, I was looking forward to this game a couple weeks ago.
[02:05.01]Apparently, it's kind of fun, but not that special.
[02:10.45]So, let's wait.
[02:11.59]Let me wait until... I made a tweet.
[02:12.95]Give me a second.
[02:19.46]I love the PogChamp emote snake.
[02:24.72]EU-friendly stream?
[02:25.56]Unfortunately, it's only gonna be, like, 45 minutes.
[02:31.25]I will explain.
[02:33.69]Just wait till the Twitter folks come on in.
[02:35.73]Does it cost money?
[02:42.09]I don't think it costs money to do this.
[02:48.03]Explain it.
[02:48.93]EXPLAIN IT.
[02:49.69]Alright, now we're gonna explain.
[02:59.46]Let me move this out of the way so you can see it.
[03:03.87]This is where you get your explanation.
[03:05.17]Hold on.
[03:09.57]Hold on.
[03:10.71]Put this down.
[03:12.11]Pull this over.
[03:15.19]Get this shit over there.
[03:16.38]Alright, so.
[03:18.42]What you're looking at here...
[03:21.53]Well, what you're looking at here is the main menu to Redeemer, but... So, Twitch is testing a feature, as I'm sure you see.
[03:30.24]I guess my channel is one of the channels that were picked to try it.
[03:34.60]This is a new emote feature on the channel that they're trying to do.
[03:39.52]And as you can see, you can do emotes now without having to put them in the chat, it seems.
[03:46.24]I don't know anything about it.
[03:47.32]All I know is that it's just like on the side.
[03:49.14]There's no fucking moderation on it at all.
[03:51.52]You can just like, they're just testing it.
[03:56.98]It's getting in the way of messages.
[04:02.68]You can still do it in chat, but I don't think there's a way for me to like calm it down.
[04:11.41]But somehow one of my emotes has made it up there.
[04:17.37]I'm going for 10,000 PogChamps.
[04:19.75]There was like a random guy there.
[04:23.45]This emote cookie clicker.
[04:24.99]I hope you guys are enjoying it.
[04:28.40]How are you supposed to do Jupiters?
[04:29.76]Good luck.
[04:32.64]But in the meantime, we're just going to play a little Redeemer.
[04:36.48]It's exactly like Instagram.
[04:40.22]I guess nobody, I guess there's no limit to what you can even do.
[04:45.14]I have no idea.
[04:45.96]It's supposed to be my 1,000th morning of peace.
[04:49.80]I guess I need to reset that counter.
[04:53.56]Oh, dude's going against Master Chief.
[04:59.72]Oh, God.
[05:00.14]Wait a minute.
[05:00.54]Nightbot.
[05:02.06]Hold on.
[05:02.52]Nightbot is banning people.
[05:04.42]Wait a second.
[05:06.16]It's supposed to be unreachable by him.
[05:09.73]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[05:11.04]Nightbot is banning people in the chat.
[05:13.14]Oh, God.
[05:13.38]Stop spamming emotes.
[05:15.50]Nightbot, Nightbot's, like, coming in.
[05:19.78]You can't use it on mobile?
[05:35.38]That's so funny to me.
[05:36.52]I guess if you spam, you can... Hey, come on, guys.
[05:39.16]If you spam, you're gonna get fucking timed out.
[05:45.06]Give me this fucking Doritos.
[05:49.22]Stop spamming emotes automated by Nightbot.
[05:52.88]That makes... I haven't paid attention.
[05:55.01]This guy's picking up a fucking log, apparently.
[05:56.89]... ... ...
[06:05.97]At 600, still no ban.
[06:09.23]Feels good, man.
[06:11.51]I clicked Fog Channel a thousand times.
[06:20.46]Eventually, I think, I'm going to assume, I don't know if there's a way for me to change it.
[06:24.69]To like make it so you can only do like one or like one a minute or something?
[06:28.95]I don't know.
[06:33.15]I'm on 1,300 Jerma faces now.
[06:35.07]That's so funny.
[06:40.69]So I guess what they're trying to do is this is just like a testing this.
[06:45.60]I'm going to assume that they want to try to take like emotes, make like emotes, like put them over on the right side so the chat, you can actually see chat.
[06:53.72]I don't know.
[06:58.49]But this is Redeemer.
[07:01.25]I don't know much about it.
[07:02.33]Press X to punch an enemy and wide it.
[07:04.30]Why are we... Wait a minute.
[07:05.12]Why are we doing fucking dumbass Xbox controls?
[07:13.78]So chat's gonna be full of emotes.
[07:15.16]No, this is... They're just testing this.
[07:16.54]This is just... This is an experiment.
[07:19.16]This experiment's only gonna last, like, less than an hour.
[07:26.02]Actually, it's kind of fun to kick people and beat the shit out of them.
[07:28.66]Alright, I like it so far.
[07:33.31]I have a crosshair?
[07:34.37]I get guns in this game?
[07:35.41]Is that what I understand here?
[07:40.45]Alright, well you can fall off.
[07:44.53]A is dodge roll.
[07:45.79]Alright, cool.
[07:50.33]Oh, there goes my AC.
[07:55.07]Over 1,000.
[07:55.86]This is ADHD friendly.
[07:58.26]I can't stop clicking.
[08:02.00]The best part is just the PogChamps, man.
[08:03.66]It really is.
[08:04.10]It's like... Just zero mile.
[08:12.15]Let me turn this off.
[08:12.73]Let me turn this, like, down.
[08:13.77]Oh, okay.
[08:18.23]My AC is right next to my fucking window.
[08:19.81]Like, what a dumb place to put that.
[08:24.45]So here's the funny thing, like, some people are just getting timed out by Nightbot.
[08:28.45]So I guess, like, some of the rules still apply.
[08:32.57]Rules still apply, apparently.
[08:35.34]So if you spam emotes, you are gonna get, like, banned.
[08:43.36]Twitch is gonna look at this, because they're, like, collecting data.
[08:46.74]So they're gonna look at this shit, and they're gonna be like, oh, stealth kill.
[08:52.38]Alright, well I just like pressed on his head and it killed him.
[08:54.93]Can I pick this up?
[08:56.87]You can.
[08:57.23]Holy shit, that's cool.
[08:59.99]They're gonna see like, oh wow, looks like this guy wrote PogChamp 985 times.
[09:08.63]Not if you're a mod.
[09:12.90]You know what?
[09:14.08]The developers forgot what it was like just to be able to hit people with a fucking stick.
[09:17.16]You know what I mean?
[09:19.06]Check your surroundings.
[09:21.64]Oh, there we go.
[09:27.03]Okay.
[09:27.89]That was easy.
[09:29.07]Okay, that guy already... That guy saw me.
[09:31.39]And he decided to turn around anyways.
[09:32.63]So the weapon's gonna break.
[09:36.89]Can't time out a mod for spamming selfies.
[09:39.45]Wait, does it actually pop up on the... I don't understand.
[09:42.37]I'm so confused.
[09:48.03]Can I teleport around?
[09:52.51]I like the dodge roll, though.
[09:55.51]2,000 strong.
[09:56.65]Again, if you're just joining us, Twitch is... We're testing a feature for Twitch that's not available yet.
[10:03.83]We'll be in Twitch Guinea pigs right now.
[10:08.61]I saw one next.
[10:13.84]Performing an environment kill.
[10:16.38]I can burn this guy's face?
[10:18.30]No, kind of.
[10:23.68]Nothing like a never-ending stream of fog champ I'm just playing might and magic again.
[10:33.22]It's picking up shit in the environment and throwing it So this stream is only gonna be like like 45 minutes, we're just testing a feature This isn't a real stream the real stream is tomorrow I'm not even watching the game.
[10:51.45]I'm just watching the emotes.
[10:52.79]Oh
[10:59.41]Laugh at my ass off.
[11:00.25]What the fuck is happening?
[11:01.53]Alright, so they light up when they're about to swing which is you get a real Batman vibe get is there a block Can I like catch people and I can I pull the tree trunk out?
[11:14.67]Well, that must be an environment kill Yeah, it's just a fake stream, sorry guys
[11:23.23]I do see how this feature could be fairly interesting, though.
[11:25.63]Ow.
[11:25.69]What the fuck?
[11:28.13]The stream could be... Like, the feature could be cool.
[11:32.47]If... If... Can I turn this off?
[11:35.94]No, I have to turn it off.
[11:40.34]I have to be the one to turn it off.
[11:44.62]Replenish your vitality by killing... Alright, so you get health by killing people.
[11:49.20]Easy enough.
[11:50.41]I want to have environment kill somebody on this.
[11:54.55]Can I do it again?
[11:54.99]I guess I can't do it again.
[11:57.04]Alright.
[12:04.04]At least it's emote spam.
[12:05.26]2200.
[12:06.07]I'm gonna go now.
[12:11.99]I gotta get used to that one.
[12:17.68]Oh my god.
[12:18.04]That was an overhead punch that time.
[12:21.51]You sprained your wrist doing this?
[12:24.51]Well, I'm sorry.
[12:25.53]Turn it off.
[12:26.65]No, we have to... We gotta keep it on for a little while.
[12:29.48]And it looks like PogChamp is the number one right now.
[12:34.96]What about, like... What about my emotes?
[12:37.18]Can you get, like, my emotes up there?
[12:40.32]You know what I mean?
[12:40.74]Get, like, some Jerm of Fears up there.
[12:45.99]Let's see.
[12:46.33]Let's get some other emotes up there.
[12:47.93]Get some variety.
[12:48.91]Try and build something.
[12:50.74]You guys have to build like a monster.
[12:52.00]I can't.
[12:59.99]No, that's fine.
[13:00.95]Let's kick him in the face a few times.
[13:02.19]I want another weapon.
[13:05.17]There we go.
[13:05.74]Why is it only Jerm of Mars is available?
[13:11.02]You guys can't do anything else?
[13:12.22]One.
[13:12.30]What the fuck?
[13:21.43]I guess you still have to be subbed, huh?
[13:23.85]That makes sense, I guess.
[13:29.13]Nightbot timed out this guy for, like, three minutes.
[13:32.60]Stop spamming emotes.
[13:36.62]How did you guys do the other emotes?
[13:39.00]I think it, like, picks up.
[13:41.23]I'm pretty sure it picks up what people are doing in the chat, and it's trending emotes.
[13:46.53]So the more you guys spam PogChamp, the more like, we're not gonna get any other, let's get some other emotes up on the fucking shelf.
[14:01.46]He ducked it, really, come on.
[14:06.05]5,000 later, I don't think the system works.
[14:10.02]Yeah, okay, everybody, let's just do something here.
[14:13.16]Everybody stop clicking the PogChamp button.
[14:15.48]And, like, just dump, like, dump, like, a dozen, just dump a ton of fucking jermaMoons in the chat.
[14:22.06]Just everybody start doing it.
[14:23.04]Just start fucking spamming jermaMoon.
[14:31.38]Okay, that was cool.
[14:34.12]Spam.
[14:37.03]Wait, does it not work?
[14:40.25]Do none of my emotes work anymore?
[14:45.95]Oh, there we go.
[14:46.49]There it is.
[14:47.05]There it is.
[14:47.31]See it?
[14:48.21]Now it's like up on the menu.
[14:49.31]See, it's like shaking around.
[14:52.23]There it is.
[14:52.59]Alright, spam it.
[14:54.30]Spam fucking Jerma moons.
[14:58.74]Yeah, we got it.
[14:59.30]But we're learning.
[14:59.86]We're learning how it works.
[15:04.10]You can hit from a dodge roll.
[15:05.34]Okay.
[15:08.19]Guy has a gun.
[15:08.75]Give me the gun.
[15:09.47]Alright, I have a gun now.
[15:14.03]Alright, this game's kind- This game's kind of cool.
[15:20.10]Oh, by the way, I apologize to all the people that are actually getting banned.
[15:23.70]For no reason.
[15:25.02]We will take a look at that after the stream and make sure you're not, like, banned.
[15:33.17]Kick him off the edge.
[15:33.99]Make it fun.
[15:37.98]No!
[15:39.12]Oh sh- What is it?
[15:40.64]Oh god damn it.
[15:41.58]I don't even know.
[15:42.54]What does it even save?
[15:43.90]I fell off the fucking cliff.
[15:44.76]Can I get back up?
[15:48.58]Oh, great.
[15:49.55]This is it.
[15:50.03]I'm gonna fall down and I'm gonna have to reload it.
[15:55.61]No.
[16:00.19]Restart.
[16:00.93]Do not restart the level.
[16:03.77]This is- Okay, this is not- This is not the level restarting.
[16:06.66]It's the checkpoint.
[16:13.55]Oh wait, I'm actually playing a game.
[16:15.17]I'm playing a game just for the sake of playing a game to test the feature.
[16:25.61]Take that, subbies.
[16:26.69]Alright, let's beat the bag out of these guys.
[16:38.63]So essentially they made like a Batman Ark of Asylum game.
[16:42.61]That's a little bit harder to do parries with guns.
[16:46.12]And it's top down.
[16:49.70]Oh, I've seen PogChamps again.
[16:53.78]Get some more things on the board.
[16:55.82]What about like... Alright, so I got a question.
[16:59.28]If you're not subbed to the channel...
[17:02.56]Can you still do the emote that's there?
[17:04.64]Like, can you put jermaMoon in the chat?
[17:07.08]Can you throw that up there if you are not subbed?
[17:14.02]Or does that not work?
[17:17.00]Yes, yes, only 10 times.
[17:19.84]Alright, well now the frog's up there.
[17:26.25]We're just moving from emote to emote to spam.
[17:32.64]Fucking frog.
[17:34.48]Now what's the next one going to be?
[17:35.76]What are we going to move on to after this?
[17:42.27]I could see how this game could be fun for somebody that loves to go real fast.
[17:47.27]Nope.
[17:48.83]Unwelcome guests.
[17:53.33]Glossary has been updated.
[17:55.71]Is that another perk?
[17:59.98]Is there like stealth in this game?
[18:01.22]Or do you just go running to smash people?
[18:03.08]I'm just gonna stay with that theory.
[18:04.54]Oh, we got a chat getting on board.
[18:09.92]Another emote to train up the right side.
[18:15.52]Our time has come.
[18:16.88]It's time for that.
[18:18.43]Oh, God.
[18:22.77]Super frog let's play.
[18:29.33]How is that guy not paying attention?
[18:30.75]I don't know.
[18:34.61]Guns are pretty powerful though.
[18:39.25]Guns are really powerful.
[18:41.72]But I'm gonna have to take the hammer.
[18:43.66]Hammer's more important.
[18:46.24]What is this?
[18:46.64]I don't know.
[18:49.38]Now we get the orc?
[18:54.40]That's so stupid.
[18:58.67]I want to hit him with... Did he just break my sledgehammer?
[19:01.15]Are you serious?
[19:03.31]Here we go.
[19:04.39]Maybe it was a throwing sledgehammer.
[19:06.09]I'm going to sneeze.
[19:07.35]Oh, no, wait.
[19:08.13]This is a good thing.
[19:08.66]This is a good sneeze.
[19:09.26]Come on, sneeze.
[19:10.04]I know what emote's going to come up if I sneeze.
[19:13.16]Fuck, come on.
[19:15.62]Sneeze, so we can get the sneeze emote that everybody uses.
[19:18.38]It's not going to happen.
[19:20.27]I started talking, so I don't have to sneeze anymore.
[19:31.14]I can't sneeze.
[19:32.38]I'm trying.
[19:32.82]See, these guys are like armored.
[19:41.58]Execute an enemy with a red skull.
[19:44.24]That's cool.
[19:46.84]Get behind him.
[19:47.34]Buried in his head.
[19:49.22]I love how execution was just throw guy.
[19:51.68]Cool.
[19:54.59]What is chat?
[19:56.97]Again, I will try to say it.
[19:59.09]It's gonna be hard to keep up because there's a lot of random people trickling in.
[20:03.11]We're just doing a quick, like, 45-minute stream to test a new feature on Twitch.
[20:10.13]This isn't a real stream.
[20:12.61]Don't worry.
[20:13.23]It's a fake one.
[20:15.55]Streamer is a liar.
[20:17.79]Oh, shit.
[20:23.36]Right in the head.
[20:24.38]Got him.
[20:28.14]A quick 24-hour stream.
[20:32.85]Actually, you know what?
[20:33.47]While I got you guys here, we can decide what we're going to do tomorrow.
[20:37.07]Because there's a few options.
[20:40.85]There's two things that I want to do.
[20:42.12]One requested thing.
[20:45.02]And then one thing that I thought would be fun to do.
[20:47.42]Although, I don't know how much patience I'm going to have with it, so... We will see how much patience I have.
[20:59.79]God damn it.
[21:00.61]These big guys break his fucking neck.
[21:02.27]I just ripped his throat out.
[21:03.39]Okay, that works too.
[21:06.41]Ow.
[21:11.91]No, I don't want to just dive around like a dickhead.
[21:16.15]What the fuck is he doing?
[21:16.93]Alright, pretty good suplex.
[21:22.65]Nice.
[21:22.85]Wow, look at the Minecraft emote.
[21:35.26]PC build.
[21:36.94]I still do need to do that.
[21:38.84]God damn it.
[21:39.48]I keep forgetting.
[21:40.41]There's so many things that I want to do.
[21:42.97]I'm going to burn this guy's face.
[21:44.03]Come on over here.
[21:46.33]That's an easy kill.
[21:49.51]These guys you got to dodge and then queue up.
[21:51.15]No.
[21:51.61]Queue up with a big one.
[21:54.55]Like that.
[21:55.15]And then break his fucking neck.
[21:59.86]Cool.
[22:01.02]Easy.
[22:03.62]Not enough rats.
[22:06.15]You gotta do more rats, guys.
[22:07.92]Come on.
[22:08.14]Can I pick the table up?
[22:09.42]No.
[22:13.34]Just do the super fucking kick.
[22:16.63]Don't do anything else.
[22:24.84]What?
[22:25.84]Falcon punch didn't do anything?
[22:31.28]What's the point of the emote thing?
[22:32.34]I think it's a way for, eventually, when Twitch is done with the experiments, I think it's going to be a way for Twitch to... lessen the emote spam in chats, I think?
[22:44.43]That's my understanding of the situation.
[22:50.68]So then, if an emote's up that a lot of people are using, it'll be, oh, wow, cool, I'm just going to use this now.
[22:55.52]I don't have to write it in chat, like, chat.
[23:01.29]Unless I did something wrong which in that case like I'm gonna like I'm gonna talk to like the guy at Twitch And he's gonna be like hey dude like you really like fucked up And I'll be like oh, sorry Maybe you're not supposed to be able to spam it this much I'm gonna laugh so hard if the guy at Twitch is just like hey, dude.
[23:26.01]What the fuck are you doing?
[23:29.35]You were supposed to put it on like a different timer.
[23:32.75]Not that I could see, though.
[23:33.53]It didn't look like there was anything I could click on to make that happen.
[23:39.29]There's a lot of people here.
[23:40.21]Alright.
[23:42.49]I got to burn this guy's face.
[23:43.35]Come here.
[23:48.15]Another big guy?
[23:48.86]What?
[23:50.32]I should be parrying.
[23:51.08]I don't know why I'm not.
[23:53.74]It's the right time.
[23:54.30]You got to do this, right?
[23:55.60]Nope.
[23:56.12]I had it wrong.
[23:58.06]Right when that red circle pops up like that.
[24:08.62]There we go.
[24:09.91]Back to PogChamps.
[24:12.55]I like it.
[24:14.53]Give me the gun.
[24:16.77]Gun, best weapon.
[24:21.24]I'm going to die here if I'm not careful.
[24:26.18]Nice.
[24:26.56]The monk from Diablo 3.
[24:27.56]That's the monk's move.
[24:29.28]In fact, this is just the monk from Diablo 3, except it's not Diablo 3.
[24:32.54]Why am I just coming to this realization right now?
[24:35.60]Was that one move the thing that made me realize this was Diablo 3?
[24:44.42]Diablo 3 with guns.
[24:48.27]Do some nays.
[24:55.08]Can I burn people?
[24:55.68]Throw them in the fire?
[24:58.22]Not really.
[25:02.78]Come on, block that shit.
[25:08.34]Watch it.
[25:08.70]Alright, give him the double uppercut.
[25:13.88]Good.
[25:18.32]Ow.
[25:20.02]What's with this super early stream?
[25:22.11]You mean this non-stream?
[25:24.69]I really should put, like, fake stream in the title, shouldn't I?
[25:29.35]Bad guy?
[25:29.85]Good guy?
[25:32.18]Good guy.
[25:35.98]How do you choose an emote that isn't one of the six?
[25:38.94]It keeps track of what people are doing in the chat.
[25:43.30]So if you write, like, Kappa in the chat, if enough people do it, it's called, like, trending emotes.
[25:49.95]It'll pop up up there for you to click easily.
[25:56.76]I guess we're going in here.
[25:59.14]No shelter.
[26:02.08]Glossary has been updated.
[26:03.14]Okay, we're kind of just moving from room to... Um, alright.
[26:06.22]Alright, so, so far, let me give you my thoughts on Redeemer.
[26:17.02]Eh.
[26:19.22]I mean, it's cool.
[26:21.78]I feel like they sold me on all the shit that was cool in this game, and then now it's just this for like another ten hours.
[26:28.22]Is there anything else in the game that's like... He's gonna shoot him in the face, isn't he?
[26:32.67]Yep.
[26:35.49]I mean, you know, it's fun, but... It's always like anything else, right?
[26:48.45]I can see the appeal if... Okay, look.
[26:50.27]I can see the appeal if they're... I feel like they got all the cards on the table too quickly.
[26:59.55]I feel like I should be playing like this an hour into the game, like two hours into the game.
[27:05.21]Anybody have this game?
[27:05.99]Is this just what it is?
[27:07.49]Is there any more stuff to do?
[27:09.65]Or do you just throw a chariot guy, shoot a gun until empty, and then punch a guy in the face?
[27:19.98]Gameplay-wise, it's fun.
[27:27.38]Nobody cares about the fucking game.
[27:28.88]We're focusing on our emotes.
[27:33.62]I know, what was I thinking bringing up?
[27:35.06]What was I thinking bringing up the video game?
[27:36.91]Am I crazy?
[27:41.05]This is an emote stream and nothing more.
[27:50.64]Let's at least get to a boss.
[27:56.05]I could have gotten here a little bit earlier.
[27:58.28]Alright, new weapon?
[27:58.88]Is it like a bat?
[28:01.68]What is this?
[28:02.02]It's like a baton.
[28:02.74]Alright, it's the exact same thing that everyone else is using.
[28:05.72]It's the same thing I've been using, except it doesn't have electricity on the end.
[28:08.34]Oh, it's a shotgun.
[28:13.08]Alright.
[28:15.98]Stream the emoji movie.
[28:18.95]No.
[28:19.19]I'm not gonna stream the fucking emoji movie, guys.
[28:25.39]uh I'm gonna get down there somehow down open well that was kind of alright we've got we've gotten more interesting what's left any more shotguns I just want to can I only have a shotgun that's what I want I just want a shotgun
[28:54.71]I just want to use the guns.
[28:55.57]The guns are the best part.
[29:01.56]This game feels like something else.
[29:04.28]And I can't put my hand on it.
[29:08.53]Stream Pac-Man.
[29:10.69]Well, I bought this on Steam because I was thinking, you know, that looks kind of fun.
[29:14.05]Maybe I could... I'm going to die.
[29:15.24]Holy shit.
[29:20.21]I need to heal.
[29:21.19]So I don't get healed if I kill people with melee.
[29:23.95]Uh, with range.
[29:24.57]Is that what I'm understanding here?
[29:25.67]Yeah, it's like Hotline Miami.
[29:28.43]Yeah, I can see that.
[29:29.96]Uh, yeah.
[29:31.14]I bought this on Steam.
[29:32.50]I thought, that looks kind of cool.
[29:33.78]Maybe it'd be like a fun thing to play.
[29:37.60]You know, it's whatever.
[29:39.93]It's alright.
[29:42.57]I don't have anything particularly bad to say about this game.
[29:44.75]I don't really have anything particularly good to say either, though.
[29:48.39]Well, you know what?
[29:48.91]I can say this.
[29:50.19]It's a video game.
[29:51.55]It's a game.
[29:52.11]This is a video game we're playing.
[30:02.30]I gotta start killing people with melee.
[30:03.44]I'm gonna die.
[30:09.97]What the fuck are these emotes?
[30:13.93]Alright, should I stop explaining it?
[30:15.87]Because how many people do you think are going to come in that are just going to be like, what the fuck is this?
[30:19.33]Did this guy, like, hack Twitch?
[30:24.71]Arena has been unlocked.
[30:25.93]Alright, well, I unlocked the arena.
[30:27.05]Alright, I've got to, like, drain their blood.
[30:32.19]That's how you win.
[30:33.79]I could have melee Sua.
[30:36.51]Like, Sua.
[30:37.31]Suaplexed!
[30:39.51]A Suaplexed?
[30:44.02]My brain has been, like, fried lately.
[30:45.68]Yeah, this just in.
[30:50.68]Welcome to the stream, guys.
[30:51.56]You guys just tuning in right now.
[30:53.86]I pressed a couple of buttons, and yet, yonkey, there we are.
[30:57.89]Took me, like, 20 minutes to get this thing set up.
[30:59.67]I'm worried about this wicked streamer.
[31:10.37]Get on the screen, man.
[31:14.45]I'm gonna die.
[31:15.43]Fuck.
[31:20.14]That was lucky.
[31:22.26]This guy with the gun's gotta go, man.
[31:23.92]Oh my god!
[31:24.92]Oh, fucking god damn it!
[31:33.32]Fucking swanky.
[31:36.24]Where are we?
[31:40.80]Well, I guess the gun works just as good on you as it does on them.
[31:49.49]What a fail.
[31:50.19]Fucking Twitch fail streamer.
[31:54.78]How many times have you guys come to a stream of mine and been like, Fail!
[31:58.42]Now, let me just clean this up.
[32:11.05]And you.
[32:12.15]Just got fucking thunderclapped.
[32:19.13]These guys have the guns.
[32:20.23]Like, fuck off.
[32:25.11]I didn't even mean to do that to this guy.
[32:26.67]And it still happened.
[32:30.70]Alright, give me a gun.
[32:32.40]Kick that door down, because who cares?
[32:33.68]Like, fuck the door.
[32:34.32]Alright, this is where I was before.
[32:37.28]This guy with the shotgun, like, ruined everything.
[32:41.20]Because, like, the camera decided to show me the guy's, like, neck getting cut off.
[32:44.36]I don't even, like, I don't care.
[32:51.83]Alright.
[32:53.55]Keep it moving.
[33:00.67]One more shot.
[33:01.87]Okay.
[33:03.81]God damn it.
[33:05.01]God damn it.
[33:05.57]God damn it.
[33:06.01]God damn it.
[33:06.91]Quick guy with a knife.
[33:10.22]God damn it.
[33:11.44]Fuck the shotgun.
[33:12.34]God damn it.
[33:15.18]Fucking Jesus.
[33:16.22]Come on.
[33:21.02]Does it pull emotes from multiple streams?
[33:22.74]No, it does not.
[33:26.40]Wait, it's broken?
[33:27.66]You guys broke it already?
[33:28.82]Hold on, you guys broke the feature already.
[33:39.49]How did you guys break it?
[33:41.19]Don't get me in trouble.
[33:42.99]I'm gonna get in big trouble with like big boy Twitch.
[33:47.41]What happened like they just like each person was spamming FailFish four thousand times and you fucking corrupted our files on the site I'm gonna get banned
[34:09.48]4K, boys.
[34:12.13]Okay, let me look over and see.
[34:13.15]Let me see what's the most important thing.
[34:16.29]I see cheese, a rat, a frog, the laughing guy, that laughing fucking Viagra commercial guy, and the dancing anime lady.
[34:28.30]Alright, sounds about right.
[34:44.75]Seven-handed fist.
[34:46.23]The monk.
[34:47.49]Alright, fucking... Fuck the guns!
[34:49.55]The guns do way too much damage in this game to me.
[34:54.34]And they don't heal you.
[34:56.18]Fuck that.
[34:58.62]And... Do they heal?
[35:03.18]Was that not happening before?
[35:09.76]Here's the same people that fucking killed me before.
[35:13.87]God damn it.
[35:27.19]God damn it, man.
[35:28.59]Get the fuck away from me.
[35:33.17]I'm so dead.
[35:36.59]The gun dropped over here.
[35:37.39]Just get it.
[35:41.30]Give me a fucking break.
[35:45.50]Give me the knife.
[35:48.46]Next, next, next.
[35:49.86]No, there ain't gonna be no next.
[35:51.22]The next is I have to turn off the fucking feature.
[35:54.26]And I have to turn the stream off.
[35:55.34]This is a quickie.
[35:55.92]This is just a little quickie, guys.
[35:57.60]It's not a real stream.
[35:58.42]I told you we did a stream yesterday.
[36:00.05]We've been streaming.
[36:00.85]Alright, first cutscene of the game.
[36:06.87]...what they're looking for.
[36:08.67]But otherwise, I'm alright.
[36:12.77]Do I get a shout-out at 25,000 PogChamps?
[36:19.33]How, like, honestly, how many, you hit 10, you did PogChamps, you did, you did PogChamp 10,000 times, dude.
[36:28.02]You guys are gonna, like, break my channel.
[36:29.84]My channel's gonna fucking break.
[36:40.73]Yeah, I only like shot 10k PogChamps through this guy's fucking channel.
[36:44.71]I'm gonna be lucky if my stream turns on tomorrow.
[36:49.63]I'm really at 25,000.
[36:50.71]You guys are just playing cookie clicker over there.
[36:59.22]That's so stupid.
[37:01.78]Here they come.
[37:09.79]It's just, somebody hit the emote jackpot.
[37:20.17]You guys are gonna have to get automated PogChamps.
[37:22.85]You guys are gonna have to upgrade your twitch.tv menu.
[37:26.21]So you end up with like, it's gonna give you plus one PogChamp every .2 seconds.
[37:31.73]Just like an idle game.
[37:40.25]Fucking love it man.
[37:41.03]That's so stupid and it's even funnier that people are getting banned People in chat are just getting banned because of this shit There is no way to currently get rid of it Sorry to disappoint let's spike somebody just for the sake of the joke
[38:09.84]The way to get rid of it is I have to turn the feature off.
[38:11.98]It's an experimental feature.
[38:14.18]It's going to get turned off very shortly here.
[38:16.80]How are you supposed to beat this game?
[38:21.58]When people are this dangerous.
[38:25.76]Oh, nice, a torch.
[38:32.67]Can I burn his face off?
[38:33.75]No, I just shot him in the head.
[38:34.69]Okay, whatever.
[38:39.97]Uh, Magical Mystery Goo.
[38:41.11]Don't want it.
[38:44.57]Although I do like this.
[38:48.37]Go down.
[38:48.91]Uh, we're in kind of a maze.
[38:54.33]You got here late?
[38:55.07]What's the feature?
[38:57.68]It's the emote.
[38:58.86]It's the emote spam feature.
[39:00.42]Uh, where the hell have I not been?
[39:06.24]Top left?
[39:06.88]Top left?
[39:09.43]Please mods.
[39:10.11]Oh, there is no moderation right now.
[39:12.95]Alright, we're cool.
[39:15.31]We got a Warhammer 40,000 hero.
[39:18.21]This is just, this is the guy, this is the leader of the Tau army.
[39:26.98]I'm gonna die.
[39:28.30]I'm actually, he's actually gonna burn me to death.
[39:36.84]How are you supposed to fight this guy?
[39:46.01]Oh, god damn it.
[39:46.81]Alright, he's like, he needs to reload.
[39:48.98]Then you go shoot him right in the face.
[39:53.10]Well, I'm out.
[39:56.40]Should I just burn him?
[39:57.26]No, why would you, you can't, you can't, this is just like Pokémon, man, it's not gonna work.
[40:03.98]And just like Pokémon, like, you rip off fucking Charizard's helmet and you step on his head.
[40:09.73]And his brains shoot out.
[40:15.05]Quick spawn of Cyclops.
[40:20.59]Hey, it worked.
[40:22.81]I see Kappas now.
[40:23.93]That's good.
[40:24.63]I like to see Kappas.
[40:28.00]I'm going to die down here.
[40:29.76]I'm going to die down here.
[40:32.32]You can't move fast in water.
[40:34.56]Nope.
[40:34.88]Apparently not.
[40:36.56]Apparently not.
[40:39.50]Please, Jerma, say my name.
[40:40.30]Battlezone 2016.
[40:40.70]Got you.
[40:47.38]Jerma knows about Warhammer 40k, are you serious?
[40:51.43]Those games were incredible.
[40:53.85]Before they ruined them.
[40:57.27]Yep, he's gonna be one of those guys.
[41:00.17]Sorry.
[41:01.67]Sorry, I'm one of those turds that hates Dawn of War 2.
[41:06.79]Sorry guys, I'm one of those buzz kills.
[41:14.18]Sorry, I have to be one of those buzz kills.
[41:20.56]Were you guys saying something?
[41:21.66]I can't tell.
[41:22.54]Are you guys collectively trying to say... You guys are like a dog right now.
[41:25.88]You know that?
[41:28.28]You guys are like a dog.
[41:30.20]No one's even chatting.
[41:31.08]I'm looking over here and I'm just seeing excitement, smelliness, happiness, and anger.
[41:38.17]I just gotta look over and see all the PogChamps.
[41:39.93]You guys are excited.
[41:40.81]You guys are like a big, giant, 5,000-headed dog.
[41:46.60]Dawn of War 2 is garbage.
[41:47.58]I agree.
[41:48.60]Dawn of War 2 wasn't garbage.
[41:49.82]They just... I didn't like it.
[41:52.89]Doesn't mean it's a bad game.
[41:53.65]It just wasn't for me.
[41:56.37]The original Dawn of War, with the expansions on it, is one of the most fun RTSs I've ever played.
[42:03.42]In fact, I would say it's probably the best RTS I've ever played.
[42:07.16]Something about going into those fights with the Necron...
[42:11.10]Oh man, with that Necron hero.
[42:12.96]The Tau is my favorite, but it was just so much fun.
[42:15.00]The moving castle.
[42:16.16]You had a gigantic moving Ziggurat as a unit.
[42:19.26]Your base was a unit.
[42:20.52]It was crazy.
[42:25.69]Wowie.
[42:30.67]Just kill him.
[42:31.19]I'm wasting that.
[42:33.59]Don't waste that.
[42:34.63]He's alive.
[42:39.80]Nice spread on that shotgun, by the way.
[42:42.68]I'm gonna fucking die again.
[42:43.66]I'm stuck in a goddamn corner.
[42:47.54]Do not kill me.
[42:49.92]Don't kill me or I'm gonna complain about your game.
[42:55.09]Okay, that's the red is that.
[42:56.03]Like, who cares?
[42:58.01]Don't kill me or I'm gonna complain about the game.
[42:59.51]Alright, go for it, dude.
[43:01.93]I don't care.
[43:07.74]What's this wowee thing in chat?
[43:15.19]In line of sight, this guy.
[43:17.22]Kind of.
[43:19.48]Chalkin's the best, by far.
[43:23.38]I'm not seeing any new emotes.
[43:26.84]All I see are the same ones that I've seen before.
[43:30.21]Come on, guys.
[43:31.03]What is this?
[43:32.87]I see the same emotes.
[43:33.93]Get some new ones up there.
[43:44.14]Can't give me the same old song and dance here, man.
[43:49.73]I've got a feeling I'm about to get to a boss.
[43:51.75]This looks like a boss area.
[43:54.27]Although I could be wrong.
[43:57.91]What the hell am I doing?
[44:02.61]I can't move.
[44:04.03]I was just sitting there in the civilian pose.
[44:05.99]And now we have to fight another fucking Tau soldier.
[44:09.67]That was dumb.
[44:17.18]No, don't.
[44:19.76]Don't.
[44:23.26]Got it.
[44:32.31]Stop his head.
[44:32.81]There we go.
[44:38.85]What else is even going on in this game?
[44:43.49]Alright, okay.
[44:44.13]On a scale of one...
[44:47.69]I gotta look over at the chat here.
[44:48.81]So, let's get some nays and yays in the chat, please.
[44:51.59]So we can see what people actually think.
[44:54.78]Anybody interested in this game?
[44:56.28]At all?
[44:59.70]I wanna see that fly up.
[45:00.68]I'm curious.
[45:08.96]Nay, nay.
[45:09.60]No, I mean like the emote.
[45:10.62]The emote yay or nay.
[45:13.49]No, don't say yay or nay.
[45:14.99]Like, give me the emote yay or nay.
[45:18.12]I wanna see the- we're doing emote!
[45:20.00]You guys are only supposed to talk in emotes.
[45:22.79]That's how this works today.
[45:26.01]Oh shit, I think you guys actually did break it.
[45:29.33]There we go, there we go, okay.
[45:32.15]Is anyone having any fun?
[45:33.77]There's not even enough yays.
[45:35.49]There's not even enough yeses to let it come up on the screen.
[45:51.28]Don't talk to me unless you're an emote.
[45:55.32]So many fucking... Dude, what is this, like... What's that dumb game that you eat the dots?
[46:01.87]What's the game where you walk around as a giant, like, fucking goofy planet and you shit out dots?
[46:06.23]And you eat people?
[46:07.57]Something EO?
[46:10.08]Agario.
[46:11.78]Somebody... One of you guys really, really is huge in Agario right now.
[46:15.24]Because you're shitting out lots of stuff.
[46:27.24]What a feature, man.
[46:30.08]With a little work, this could be a really good feature, I think.
[46:36.58]I'm certain of that.
[46:43.63]I can't wait, because after this stream at some point later this week, I have to get in a call with Twitch fucking programmers and shit.
[46:54.20]And they're gonna tell me that, like, PogChamp was done, like, 455,000 times.
[46:59.88]How am I supposed to respond to that?
[47:01.84]What do I say to that?
[47:04.16]Uh, yeah, we're just going over some of the data here.
[47:06.20]So, PogChamp was done 2.7 million times.
[47:10.48]How is that possible, Jeremy?
[47:11.85]I'm gonna be like, I don't know.
[47:14.59]You guys wanted me to test it.
[47:15.81]What do you want me to do?
[47:16.97]We tested it.
[47:21.90]Not enough fog chat.
[47:23.02]Alright, we got yay Okay, here's here's what's gonna happen here guys I'm gonna leave this up to you you get this is Twitch plays emote story You guys remember those fucking stupid things where it was like an eyeball it was like an eyeball meant like I and then like like like uh I'm trying to think of like what the hell they called where would show symbols and like the symbol was a word and it made a sentence and
[47:46.96]Like something like tea.
[47:48.92]Like it was like, instead of like the letter T, it was like an iced tea.
[47:52.00]And you had to say the word like, I love that tea.
[47:55.45]And it was, you put together, it was fucking, you know what I'm talking about?
[47:57.83]Does anyone know what I'm trying to say here?
[48:02.47]Egyptian language?
[48:04.11]No.
[48:05.29]What do you, no, listen.
[48:06.93]What is it called?
[48:10.35]People like emote language and people write like the emotes that are supposed to be certain letters and words and you're supposed to decipher what I'm trying to say.
[48:17.05]A rebus puzzle.
[48:20.35]Is that what it is?
[48:21.05]A rebus.
[48:22.99]Alright, so I want to see a fucking general rebus puzzle over here.
[48:29.69]I'm looking over at it right now.
[48:30.87]I don't see a word here.
[48:35.91]Give me a rebus puzzle over here.
[48:39.53]And by the end of this stream, there had better be a good one.
[48:43.05]Good luck.
[48:47.43]I look forward to what you guys come up with.
[48:52.15]As I fucking rocket through a shotgun.
[48:55.09]Wait, is it a Re- What is a Rebus?
[48:57.31]Are you guys making that word up?
[48:59.27]I need to look this up on my phone.
[49:00.41]Give me a second.
[49:05.72]Isn't like Rebus like a T?
[49:11.33]No, that's correct.
[49:12.25]Yeah, it is.
[49:12.67]It's a Rebus.
[49:17.50]You guys give me a Rebus puzzle.
[49:24.46]Googling tactics.
[49:31.08]That was a pretty good political joke.
[49:33.46]Reins Rebus.
[49:34.64]Rebus Rebus.
[49:37.44]Rebus Rebus.
[49:41.01]Hey, remember that guy that used to work at the White House, Rebus Prebus?
[49:45.03]Yeah, he was really good, fucker.
[49:46.59]He was good, wasn't he?
[49:55.64]Rebus Prebus.
[50:01.37]Okay, I see a rat.
[50:02.45]No, it's not.
[50:03.59]You guys are doing too many PogChamps.
[50:04.97]You gotta bring up some new emotes.
[50:06.93]Somebody has to take charge of this.
[50:12.01]How are you supposed to win?
[50:13.43]How are you supposed to fucking win this game?
[50:16.91]Everyone has guns.
[50:17.43]How are you supposed to beat it?
[50:24.69]Everybody has the same guns as you.
[50:25.73]It's not fair.
[50:26.15]These are all players.
[50:26.85]Alright, just replace gun with gun and keep moving.
[50:44.41]I can't get over fucking Rebus Prebus.
[50:48.35]Also, another thing.
[50:49.03]This is important.
[50:49.67]Now that I think of that, I mean, that guy's name is like fucking weird, right?
[50:53.32]So, what is the chocolate?
[50:56.22]I want you guys to spell it out phonetically, by the way.
[50:59.74]We may have talked about this before, but I want to make sure I get this point gone across completely.
[51:04.24]The chocolate with the peanut butter in the middle.
[51:06.18]Do it phonetically.
[51:08.93]Write it out phonetically.
[51:12.13]It's less than an R.
[51:22.34]Okay.
[51:23.12]Yep.
[51:24.88]Okay.
[51:25.56]Okay.
[51:26.14]I'm seeing it.
[51:26.74]I'm seeing the correct way to say it.
[51:30.62]Jesus fucking Christ.
[51:33.64]Look at this.
[51:34.24]I'm being hunted down by never-ending impossible enemies.
[51:39.75]Alright, so good.
[51:40.65]I'm glad that most of you guys understand.
[51:42.57]It's Reese's.
[51:44.27]It's not Reese's.
[51:46.44]Reese's no, it's Reese's and what are the things called that are the mini ones that are like M&Ms?
[51:53.65]They are small circular.
[51:54.85]What are they really they're what?
[51:58.01]Those are Reese's Pieces, they're not Reese's Pieces those are Reese's Pieces Sorry, if you disagree with that, I'm sorry, but that's just not that's just not the way it is They fucking Reese's Pieces
[52:16.40]Not Reese's Pieces, not Reese's Pieces.
[52:19.42]Reese's Pieces.
[52:21.13]Reese's Priebus Pieces.
[52:23.87]Reince Priebus' Reese's Pieces.
[52:28.09]Wait, do I have to fight these guys?
[52:29.51]Of course I do.
[52:30.05]It's a fucking game where you fight people.
[52:41.27]Holy shit, a lot of guys.
[52:47.16]Let's do that.
[52:50.40]Oh, I knew I was gonna get grabbed.
[52:52.98]Thank God I got it right.
[52:53.98]Oh, I'm telling you, it's... It's not Reese's Pieces.
[53:00.33]I've heard people say that.
[53:01.11]It's like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[53:02.03]Reese's Pieces?
[53:05.57]That's like you tried to say the word, but then you got, like, timid.
[53:07.93]Oh, can I have some Reese's Pieces, please?
[53:11.27]Pieces?
[53:12.27]No, it's Reese's Pieces!
[53:17.16]And you gotta say it with fucking anger.
[53:21.03]And very loudly.
[53:23.49]Naughty, can I get a, uh, actually, I'm at the movie theater, uh, coming here to see Finding Nemo 2.
[53:28.53]Nice.
[53:29.07]Uh, can I get some, uh, Reese's Pieces, please?
[53:31.97]They'll, you have to know what the fuck, they didn't need, the purpose, the guy at the counter needs to know what you're talking about.
[53:36.70]He's not, he's gonna get confused if you start to say, like, Reese's Pieces.
[53:39.62]He's gonna be like, what the fuck did you just tell me?
[53:42.36]The guy works at a movie theater.
[53:43.34]He knows his crandy.
[53:47.34]Oh, god damn it.
[53:50.66]And I'm stuck here.
[53:51.30]This is going to be the end of the stream if I die.
[53:55.46]Is that a can of Coke?
[53:57.59]It is.
[53:57.81]Nice.
[54:04.19]Oh, god.
[54:04.55]I'm stuck in the corner.
[54:05.63]This is not good.
[54:10.24]He knows his crandy.
[54:13.80]Alright, good.
[54:14.16]Give me that.
[54:14.86]Fill that up.
[54:16.80]You're telling me that in a cut- in one of those fucking melee cutscenes you can die?
[54:22.25]You don't have invulnerability frames when you're in a melee cutscene?
[54:26.51]What kind of video game did you make?
[54:29.23]I just got burnt alive while I did a predetermined animation.
[54:39.65]Thank God we're here, otherwise I would have turned off the stream.
[54:47.95]Everyone, like, wants to talk about candy and, like, saying candy correctly.
[54:57.71]It's rhesus.
[54:58.90]They pronounce it in the commercials, rhesus.
[55:01.64]And when was the last time you guys listened to a commercial?
[55:03.96]You're gonna listen to, like, Tiger Woods sell you Gillette fucking razor blades?
[55:09.64]You're gonna listen to that shit?
[55:11.06]You're gonna listen to the predetermined marketing dog shit?
[55:14.62]No, you guys are better than that.
[55:20.54]You're gonna have, like, Matthew McConaughey sell you a car?
[55:24.36]No, you're gonna go buy a car that you want, that you like.
[55:26.72]I'm not gonna get, like, some celebrity to tell you what to do.
[55:30.76]Or what to buy.
[55:31.48]Did I, like, get in a different game mode?
[55:49.32]Is that what the game's trying to tell me?
[55:55.83]Break his neck.
[55:58.80]I'm getting too political.
[56:01.26]Okay, I'm looking over at the emote thing, and you guys didn't even try.
[56:05.78]All I see is just PogChamp is still lit up.
[56:08.16]You guys were supposed to give me a rebies-prebies puzzle.
[56:12.06]And nobody did it.
[56:14.79]I do not do any cutscene here.
[56:20.21]If you go into one of those animations, I'm gonna die.
[56:22.17]So do not do that.
[56:27.07]And I did it anyways, because I'm an idiot.
[56:34.21]Now, don't do that.
[56:35.99]That'd be a big mistake.
[56:36.97]Alright, do it now.
[56:47.35]Really?
[56:50.23]This new feature is hell.
[56:58.64]You guys have to collectively spam the emote that you want to put in the tray.
[57:05.11]You guys have to collectively figure out what you want to say and then get it up on the menu.
[57:09.93]You don't just keep doing PogChamp.
[57:20.43]I want to be able to read the sentence.
[57:26.53]Oh, this guy is real fucking annoying, I will tell you that.
[57:36.35]Better, uh... B-T-T-V?
[57:39.93]B-T-T-V emotes don't work?
[57:41.77]Well, that's because B-T-T-V emotes.
[57:44.28]Uh, B-T-T-V.
[57:45.34]B-T... You guys know what I'm trying to say, okay?
[57:50.90]You know what I'm trying to say.
[57:52.40]I'm trying.
[57:53.08]I'm trying.
[58:04.26]BDDBB.
[58:06.03]Yeah, BDDBB.
[58:11.09]Reese's BCs, BTDV Reese's.
[58:15.43]Oh, yeah, yeah, you guys are fucking awesome.
[58:17.85]You guys crack me up.
[58:26.43]So, who has the most right now?
[58:27.73]What do you guys think?
[58:31.05]Anybody in the chat have, like, more than 50,000 PogChamps at this point?
[58:35.57]And how much trouble do you think you're going to get me in with Twitch?
[58:38.83]What do you think?
[58:41.75]Kind of a dumb gun.
[58:45.69]And I can't even... I'm just fucking dead.
[58:52.04]Alright, what do we got?
[58:52.76]How long has it been?
[58:53.32]It's been about an hour.
[58:54.28]Alright, I'm going to go one more life.
[58:58.16]I'm going to go one more life.
[59:00.72]And I'm going to wrap it up.
[59:05.15]You can't get in trouble for testing him.
[59:06.51]I know, I'm just kidding.
[59:08.39]Just messing around.
[59:09.05]We're gonna go with one more life.
[59:14.49]Well, that just made this way easier.
[59:17.41]Just make sure nobody sees you.
[59:18.49]This isn't even a stealth game.
[59:23.64]Oh, what?
[59:24.32]He just whipped around.
[59:25.06]That was bullshit.
[59:32.14]Dumb guy with a gun.
[59:37.12]Back to one-life commentaries, just like the old days, right?
[59:39.94]Just like the good old days.
[59:40.96]Okay, this... I'm dead.
[59:51.71]Like, this is like, seriously, this game... This isn't even on, like, the hard difficulty.
[59:55.93]It's just ringing around the rosy with guys with fucking machine guns that kill you in fucking three hits.
[60:00.47]Holy shit, man.
[60:07.30]What did I just do?
[60:07.74]I stabbed a guy in the chest.
[60:14.39]Okay, somehow we survived that.
[60:15.61]I don't know how.
[60:19.97]Before we go, though, I am going to give you guys a couple of options.
[60:23.48]Let's do what you think you want to see.
[60:28.68]He's dead.
[60:29.94]Okay.
[60:32.18]I was hoping I was going to get to the first boss.
[60:36.36]But I'm not even sure that's going to be possible.
[60:37.90]I don't even know if there are bosses in this game.
[60:46.65]Really?
[60:46.89]Come on.
[60:48.39]Don't do another firefighter game.
[60:54.43]Where else do I need to go?
[60:55.23]Up here?
[60:57.57]No, no, no, no, no.
[60:58.89]So it was him that did this.
[61:00.03]This guy burnt the whole fucking building down.
[61:03.48]And now we gotta, like, mosey on through this.
[61:06.52]And pick up random shit and throw it at him.
[61:09.51]Until we hopefully kill him and not burn.
[61:18.39]Oh, god damn it.
[61:24.01]Alright, hold on.
[61:24.62]Wait, wait, wait.
[61:25.48]We have replaced an emote.
[61:26.92]Let me see what this Rebus puzzle is doing.
[61:30.88]I thought he had the thing on his head.
[61:41.95]No, no, no, no.
[61:42.59]We're not doing the Minecraft shit.
[61:45.13]We're not doing the Minecraft channel shit.
[61:47.51]We're spamming emotes.
[61:49.17]If you don't get any nice emotes to say, don't say anything at all.
[61:53.25]He's blocking this.
[62:00.28]Thank God.

[66:02.82]Take him out.
[66:03.66]Take him out.
[66:15.83]Oh, it was a tranquilizer.
[66:17.64]I thought that was a silenced pistol.
[66:25.77]I just wish my life revolved around something more than Berkut.
[66:30.59]Alright.
[66:31.47]Let's see.
[66:32.23]Of course, we got a Minecraft emote over there on the right.
[66:35.53]I realized it could have been me.
[66:38.52]Part man, part toaster.
[66:40.76]We were like twins once, both raised on the streets, enjoying the simple pleasures of life like fights and... Hundreds of thousands of emotes.
[66:52.76]BadStreamer plays easy games.
[66:54.38]This game's not easy.
[66:57.78]Alright, so... Anime... Smelly anime love... Smelly anime love... Cool.
[67:10.88]Yeah, Minecraft.

[67:25.29]That sucks.
[67:28.35]Where is my Revis puzzle?
[67:37.54]You figured it out.
[67:39.40]Hey, I figured it out.
[67:45.33]That's the right answer.
[67:49.53]Now, do I play as this guy now?
[67:56.37]Okay, so I could just come out of my cell at any point.
[67:58.25]Alright, I'm supposed to be ending this.
[68:00.92]Okay, hold on.
[68:01.46]Wait, wait, wait.
[68:02.90]Dismember a mutant.
[68:06.94]You can rip elbows off.
[68:07.96]No.
[68:13.91]Alright.
[68:14.83]So, hold on.
[68:16.59]Let me just... I ain't playing this game anymore for now.
[68:21.87]Let me just go ahead and do this.
[68:22.94]I want to give you guys a poll for tomorrow.
[68:24.42]Because this stream, this was just an impromptu stream test of the upcoming potential new Twitch feature.
[68:32.02]I was asked to give it a go.
[68:34.44]So I did.
[68:35.51]I was only going to stream for like maybe an hour.
[68:38.05]And that's what we did.
[68:39.79]So hopefully you enjoyed testing this.
[68:41.81]I don't know what they're going to do with it.
[68:43.27]All I know is that here it is to try.
[68:46.43]Before we go though, here's what we're going to do tomorrow.
[68:49.45]Tomorrow night, regular scheduled time, not like a random impromptu stream.
[68:55.00]Let's get a straw poll up.
[68:57.46]So I can either start, let's see which, Red Faction Guerrilla.
[69:08.41]I've seen people have been asking me to play that game.
[69:12.57]I've seen it requested a few different times now.
[69:14.99]I think I spelled Gorilla wrong, but who even cares?
[69:18.15]Or I can start Gothic.
[69:22.38]There are like five different Gothic games, and I could go through and fucking play them all.
[69:28.82]Those Gothic games are old.
[69:30.62]Some of them are fairly new, but we would start from the very beginning.
[69:33.38]We would do like a Gothic week.
[69:37.30]So here we go.
[69:40.50]Start gothic or red faction gorilla.
[69:42.58]This is what we're gonna.
[69:43.38]Do this.
[69:43.60]We're gonna do tomorrow Great Bowl It is thank you so much for participating guys very much appreciated It's been a little wild, but you know it is what it is.

[70:40.23]Okay, finally.
[70:40.91]Jesus, I had to do that like fucking 15 times.
[70:42.85]Alright, so please vote on that.
[70:46.63]We're either going to start Gothic or we're going to do some Red Faction Guerrilla.
[70:52.76]It's probably going to be close as I see already so far people are... If one game isn't voted, is it going to be played eventually?
[70:59.43]Yes.
[71:01.07]This is just like what you want because obviously playing Gothic and starting Gothic is going to be...
[71:06.67]That's... I want to give time to each game.
[71:10.17]So... And, you know, who knows?
[71:11.75]Maybe after, like, Gothic 1 or Gothic 2, we could do Red Faction in between, like, Gothic 3.
[71:17.78]But... Those Gothic games, there's a lot of potential for them to be very fun.
[71:22.92]So... Man, I spelled Gorilla wrong.
[71:25.34]There's a fucking, like... I don't even know what the... Whatever.
[71:27.50]Don't even matter.
[71:29.52]I have never played Gothic, and I have never played Red Faction Gorilla.
[71:32.36]Either one.
[71:34.39]So, vote on that poll.
[71:36.41]Keep it clean.
[71:38.25]And before I go, thank you so much to DaKingInTheNorth.
[71:42.16]DaKingInTheNorth for the 10 bucks.
[71:45.02]Love the stream.
[71:45.66]Thank you.
[71:46.40]Keep doing what you're doing.
[71:47.16]Well, thanks a lot, man.
[71:47.92]Appreciate the money, obviously.
[71:50.08]That's a lot of money.
[71:51.93]Like, even if you give 10 bucks, like, some people have been, like, subscribed to this channel for, like, fucking, like, three years.
[72:00.05]That's a lot of fucking money.
[72:01.01]That's a lot of commitment.
[72:02.01]So, like, that's incredibly... I'm incredibly thankful for that.
[72:06.21]Uh, BuddhaBist, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[72:07.97]So, Dawn of War, Soulstorm, stream tomorrow.
[72:10.03]No.
[72:11.34]No, I used to... I lost a lot of time to that game, though.
[72:13.78]I have, like, hundreds of hours in those games over the course of, like, my college life.
[72:18.96]Uh, GoodGuyTY, thank you for the $8.
[72:21.46]Oh, sorry, $3.
[72:22.72]RadioVidya, thanks for the $5.
[72:25.00]You hit 5,000 frogs, GoodGuyTY.
[72:29.15]Well, I'm glad.
[72:33.99]I'm a big boy now, RadioVidya?
[72:35.75]Well, thank you.
[72:37.71]Sometimes I like to be a big boy.
[72:38.91]WeezWix, thanks for the $6.
[72:41.17]jermaSun, is what they say.
[72:43.26]No GermaSuns, no GermaPlanets?
[72:45.00]Besides the moon, we just have like Minecraft and anime girls?
[72:48.73]What's going on here?
[72:51.06]I just realized that.
[72:52.94]Robo Gandalf, thanks for the $5.
[72:55.48]Put in super... You know what would be cool?
[72:57.30]If we put in really super spammable emotes.
[73:00.93]There's going to be moderation on this.
[73:02.49]I'm going to assume once it's finally put through...
[73:05.58]then the same rules are probably going to apply to moderation for actual emote moderation.
[73:11.72]So you can't just spam it.
[73:12.92]Maybe you can do it five times in a minute or something, I would assume, once it's finally in.
[73:16.86]I can't even tell you.
[73:17.62]I have no idea.
[73:19.76]GutsGetter, thanks for the $10.
[73:23.32]I missed that from last night.
[73:24.34]I don't know if you're here or not, but thank you.
[73:26.26]So, let that poll run.
[73:27.72]I appreciate everybody testing this impromptu stream.
[73:32.48]See you guys tomorrow at the regular time.
[73:35.08]This is going to be turned off in about like 10 minutes.
[73:39.22]So, get your fucking champs in there.
[73:41.56]Get your hearts in there.
[73:44.26]Because it's turning off in about 10 minutes.
[73:46.91]So, goodbye guys.
[73:48.03]Good afternoon.
[73:48.81]Thanks for sticking around.
[73:50.07]And I will see you guys tomorrow.
[73:51.19]Have a nice day.
[73:53.49]Goodbye.
