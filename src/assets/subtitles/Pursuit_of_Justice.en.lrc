[01:24.63]Hey, hi guys.
[01:27.76]Hope you're having a good Saturday afternoon.
[01:33.08]Hi, my name is Jeremy.
[01:36.10]Sometimes we play video wake-ups here.
[01:41.92]And that's what we're going to do.
[01:43.86]Something's wrong with me tonight.
[01:46.98]Something's not right.
[01:49.82]Something's not right with me.
[01:52.20]No, we're gonna play The Pursuit of Justice.
[01:54.82]I got it to work.
[01:56.02]I got my Windows 98 virtual machine to work.
[01:59.69]So, let's hope this actually does what it's supposed to do.
[02:04.49]Nervous streamer.
[02:05.27]No, I don't know.
[02:05.81]I'm, like, tired or something.
[02:10.60]This actually was pretty exhausting to get this to work.
[02:12.80]I'm exhausted.
[02:14.42]Give me a break, guys.
[02:15.40]Go on.
[02:17.90]Yeah, this is a Windows 98 virtual machine.
[02:20.96]And in it, we're gonna play the Pursuit of Justice.
[02:22.66]It's an FMV crime lawyer game.
[02:25.24]I have no fucking idea.
[02:27.86]I just bought it from Amazon because I thought it looked funny.
[02:31.85]This could be a terrible stream.
[02:32.91]It could be a great stream.
[02:34.69]You have to roll the dice when you come here.
[02:38.55]You have to stop downloading Injustice for that?
[02:40.39]How is Injustice 2?
[02:41.27]Is it fun?
[02:43.01]Or is it like, eh?
[02:46.33]What happened to Yakuza?
[02:48.53]Um... I want my internal capture card to work before I play Yakuza again.
[02:54.26]Because I did go back and watch some of the VOD and, like, the audio sync issues with my Elgato... Like, they are enough for me to be fucking annoyed.
[03:01.90]So... That's gonna get fixed this weekend.
[03:05.08]We're gonna go back strong to that probably on Tuesday.
[03:08.37]And, uh, you know...
[03:12.63]We'll get back to square one with that.
[03:15.77]You know.
[03:20.78]Oh, hey!
[03:24.64]Oh, hey!
[03:28.16]Why am I so big?
[03:28.98]Alright, let's go.
[03:30.94]This game might just fucking break.
[03:33.21]And I'm not prepared for that.
[03:35.99]Yes, I am.
[03:36.51]I'm always prepared.
[03:37.73]I'm prepared for anything.
[03:40.47]So let's move over here.
[03:41.61]Hey, look at that.
[03:43.42]Windows 98.
[03:44.18]I hope this works, because if it doesn't, then I'm gonna be in a lot of trouble.
[03:53.09]Hopefully there's no nudity in this game.
[03:56.29]There could be.
[03:58.21]You're literally never prepared.
[03:59.99]Yes I am, come on.
[04:00.77]You know how hard it is to prepare this shit?
[04:03.55]I didn't just open up a fucking box from GameStop and press play.
[04:07.07]I had to go install a computer inside of my computer.
[04:11.49]That's not just like opening a fucking box.
[04:13.01]That's not just opening a fucking box, okay?
[04:15.74]I didn't go get a key and open a crate.
[04:18.74]I had to install a computer in my computer.
[04:22.16]And you know how fucking hard that is?
[04:25.94]You know how much nudity is in this game?
[04:27.47]Alright, let's go.
[04:28.09]Alright, here we go.
[04:31.55]Double-clicking, you know, like say your fucking prayers Hopefully you can hear it too.
[04:37.53]There we go.
[04:38.43]Here it comes Here we go.
[04:40.53]The pursuit of justice Why is there a red outline?
[04:59.45]Okay, ladies and gentlemen, it works perfectly fine.
[05:09.66]Oh my god.
[05:11.48]Okay.
[05:13.04]This is a dog.
[05:15.18]Special delivery.
[05:16.32]Sign here, please.
[05:18.90]I already put my name in here.
[05:23.13]I wrote my name already.
[05:24.81]I skipped everything.
[05:26.11]I didn't see that, though.
[05:27.43]That's not good.
[05:31.00]Okay.
[05:32.82]So.
[05:34.06]Case selection.
[05:37.18]I guess we pick a certain case we want to work on.
[05:40.08]Is the Sunset Boulevard Deuce, the Gatsby Diamond Jewelry Theft, or the Rat Tattoo Murder?
[05:50.17]Well, I think I know which one you guys are going to want me to do.
[05:54.34]If I'm going to be honest.
[05:57.22]Why would I even do a poll?
[06:01.48]Alright, let's preview this one.
[06:03.86]When a pool hall challenge turns from a game of nine ball to a dangerous skirmish between two rival Chinese gangs, young Tommy Woo loses his life.
[06:11.53]Innocent victim or calculated target, it's you against the defense in a high-profile case, fresh out of today's headlines.
[06:18.37]Murder weapon, motive, passionate testimony, it's all there and it's time for the District Attorney to make a stand.
[06:22.51]Alright, let's hope this works.
[06:26.06]Because if it doesn't, I'm gonna be very, very upset.
[06:31.91]Oh well.
[06:32.99]Here we go.
[06:33.89]Rat tattoo murder.
[06:36.23]Play.
[06:38.53]Wait, not play, not play.
[06:40.03]Well first we have to like fucking sacrifice somebody.
[06:43.09]To make sure this works.
[06:45.92]Alright, they've been sacrificed.
[06:50.30]Oh yeah.
[06:51.52]You're him.
[06:52.64]It was you who sent my brother up the river.
[06:58.89]Did I already lose?
[07:08.07]Everybody's a fucking malfunctioning android.
[07:10.75]What do I have to do?
[07:11.73]Have to go to the deputy's office?
[07:37.52]I don't understand.
[07:38.28]Uh, I guess I have to like... Like if nothing happens in here.
[07:45.79]Okay, cool.
[07:46.29]What is this?
[07:48.61]Lawyer's Lounge.
[07:50.67]Okay.
[07:53.13]Should I watch the TV?
[07:58.08]You kids have got to stop the violence.
[08:03.15]You young people have got to stop all the killing.
[08:08.13]Tell me.
[08:08.41]Show me.
[08:08.61]What am I supposed to do?
[08:14.83]I don't get this.
[08:18.18]Is this like one of those Pac-Man tables?
[08:21.64]All rise!
[08:24.64]It's time now to play
[08:29.52]The audio is certainly trying its best.
[08:34.48]Yeah, uh, choose a point value.
[08:36.36]The higher the number, the tougher the question.
[08:37.81]What the fuck is going on?
[08:44.13]Alright, just get me out of here.
[08:46.27]Like, I need to go, like, fucking... Where's, like, the rat tattoo murderer?
[08:54.36]Alright, go back.
[08:56.51]Yeah, why was he a cartoonist?
[08:57.69]Okay, District Attorney, here we go.
[08:59.64]Frank Jarrett.
[09:00.92]Let's see how much- here we go.
[09:02.62]Whoa!
[09:21.84]Suspect's name is Michael Fong.
[09:25.32]He's a member of a Chu Sing.
[09:27.00]That's a Chinese gang.
[09:30.30]A group of kids, mostly ABCs, American-born Chinese.
[09:33.56]Wait a minute!
[09:36.78]I know that actor!
[09:37.98]They were pretty much minding their own business on the night of January 24th.
[09:40.74]Hold on, what?
[09:42.28]Until three members of the Chu Sing come in.
[09:46.21]one of the guys playing pool is a member of the resident gang the spring street boys and he's got a few it's a little shorter than the rest of his buddies and a 25 automatic so he shows the two sings and they decide to honor his request that they leave there was a security guard posted at the door but from what I understand he's got his nose in the racing form all the wireless is going on and uh he's got headphones on so he's completely oblivious
[10:12.98]An hour and a half later, there's six Chu Sings that come barging in, and Michael Fong is the point man, the ringleader.
[10:20.57]Oh, Jesus!
[10:21.25]Only this time, he had one purpose in mind.
[10:23.37]To get Tommy Woo.
[10:24.95]This is, like, pretty good.
[10:25.93]While hell breaks loose, Tommy gets stomped because he's down on the floor.
[10:32.19]Whoa!
[10:33.59]Stop it!
[10:35.05]The bullet in the head makes sure he never gets up.
[10:44.81]Anyway, that's what this one is all about.
[10:47.23]So, uh, get to work.
[10:50.17]Yeah, that was, like, better acting.
[10:51.45]Like, 30 years ago, there was better acting in full motion games.
[10:54.41]That's something to be said, right?
[10:55.39]Alright, we got four days until the trial.
[10:59.05]I don't know who we're supposed to be, uh... Who are we supposed to... What are we supposed to be doing?
[11:08.52]Chief Deputy D.A.
[11:10.06]Gerb.
[11:12.44]Okay.
[11:14.27]I can live in this place.
[11:15.36]Is it me?
[11:18.08]That's supposed to be me talking.
[11:20.28]Okay, I got a phone call.
[11:21.30]Who is it?
[11:32.59]Pick it up.
[11:33.33]Hello.
[11:34.25]Four days is ridiculous.
[11:36.81]I just got threatened, by the way.
[12:07.17]Okay.
[12:07.51]So I just got threatened.
[12:09.63]Let's go to my new supercomputer.
[12:11.55]Yeah, tell me what to do here.
[12:13.75]But you can always show up early if you think you're ready.
[12:27.69]First thing is the main menu, which shows you the different functions.
[12:31.07]Why is this skipping?
[12:32.61]The most important thing is the case constructor.
[12:35.33]Why is this skipping like it's on a fucking record player?
[12:38.96]This is where you organize your case for trial.
[12:41.76]As you go around checking out all the evidence and testimony, you take a digital picture of the stuff that looks relevant.
[12:48.18]And it shows up here in your toolbox.
[12:49.77]Go to trial?
[12:50.35]I have no evidence.
[12:53.57]Anything that can be used as evidence, you can photograph with a digital camera.
[12:58.21]If the camera's there and doesn't work, it's because your toolbar is full.
[13:02.38]Hardcore mode trial now?
[13:05.84]The first one... Okay.
[13:08.10]Fine.
[13:10.24]Going to trial.
[13:10.88]Well, if you really think you're prepared enough, go ahead.
[13:19.18]Yeah, I'm ready.
[13:20.50]I'm ready to go to trial.
[13:21.98]I just got hired.
[13:24.84]All rise.
[13:27.58]The Honorable Judge Lawrence Adams presiding.
[13:34.35]Okay.
[13:37.41]Your Honor, I don't have any fucking evidence.
[13:40.35]I don't even know.
[13:40.95]I just got hired.
[13:41.71]I just got off the subway to my desk.
[13:44.57]Ladies and gentlemen, court is now in session.
[13:50.93]I literally haven't even opened up the wax seal.
[14:10.85]The defendant is charged with first degree murder.
[14:14.79]The evidence will show he is guilty.
[14:17.87]Please insert CD2?
[14:25.54]What?
[14:26.38]Do I even have CD2?
[14:30.20]I don't think I do.
[14:30.96]Okay, I do.
[14:31.34]Hold on, I'm going to insert the second disk.
[14:33.40]Hold on a minute, guys.
[14:34.28]I'm going to insert disk 2 to object to the murder.
[14:37.10]Hold on.
[14:42.17]Where is it?
[14:43.45]Here it is.
[14:50.11]That's so funny.
[14:50.97]Alright, this is disk two.
[14:54.09]Way to really take me out of the game, Pursuit of Justice.
[14:57.91]Alright, insert CD two, The Rat Tattoo Murder.
[15:01.41]Okay.
[15:04.60]Okay, you gotta wait for windows to understand.
[15:06.84]There we go.
[15:09.28]Alright, witnesses.
[15:10.86]I don't have any witnesses, I don't think.
[15:14.26]I have no witnesses.
[15:15.53]I can't even, like, click that.
[15:17.27]Just give up.
[15:18.43]I just spit everywhere.
[15:20.07]Like, give up.
[15:22.93]We brought all these people to trial.
[15:25.97]Everybody get over here for me to say, by the way, I'm done.
[15:28.52]I got nothing.
[15:31.12]Revolving law.
[15:32.82]Examining witnesses.
[15:33.62]Okay.
[15:38.08]Okay, case constructor.
[15:40.13]Got this guy's beat up face.
[15:41.25]I have literally nothing.
[15:44.29]Okay, let's go back.
[15:51.36]Okay.
[15:53.40]How do I get out of here?
[16:01.52]I don't have anything.
[16:06.50]How do I leave?
[16:11.29]At least one witness of the case can't proceed.
[16:14.17]Okay, part of the screen is cut off?
[16:19.09]No, hold on, I'll fix that.
[16:23.42]Don't worry, I'll fix that.
[16:27.68]I'm trapped in the courtroom.
[16:30.42]I have to insert, like, oh, that was, like, my, like, hold on, move this.
[16:34.38]Okay, relevant law, relevant codes.
[16:43.29]Okay, that's fine.
[16:43.95]Like, how do I get out of this?
[16:44.90]Okay, I guess I got out.
[16:50.58]Witnesses.
[16:51.04]I don't know.
[16:51.34]Okay, well, uh, alright.
[16:53.06]Uh, I... At this time, Your Honor, the people rest.
[17:02.38]I missed y'all.
[17:02.82]Let me just insert disk three.
[17:04.58]Hold on, give me one sec.
[17:06.68]Let me just insert disk three.
[17:17.51]Here he comes.
[17:18.07]Oh my God.
[17:24.39]Alright, what do you have to say?
[17:31.64]Your Honor, I would like to make a motion to dismiss this case due to the insufficiency of the evidence.
[17:37.79]Ocean Granite, Mr. Blaine.
[17:39.83]Counselor, if you aren't going to do your homework, stay out of my courtroom.
[17:45.11]Case dismissed.
[17:46.91]Holy shit, does that guy have a face?
[17:51.94]Alright, case dismissed.
[17:52.90]I got 0%.
[17:53.18]Oh my fucking god.
[17:57.38]Hold on.
[18:06.31]Do you remember this shit back in the day, you had to like change discs?
[18:10.53]I had to put a new disk in just for them to tell me I failed the game.
[18:13.53]We actually, I want to actually see, like I want to try to do something.
[18:25.53]Don't worry about losing that case.
[18:28.35]Oh, you lost one.
[18:29.55]Big deal.
[18:30.61]You know, you didn't expect to retire undefeated, did you?
[18:34.79]So don't think about it.
[18:36.09]Just go back to your office and get to work.
[18:43.11]Oh no.
[18:43.39]What the fuck is happening?
[19:00.76]What the fuck was that?
[19:02.78]Get to work.
[19:08.52]I think the whole computer, I think my entire computer crashed.
[19:14.11]Yeah, yeah, it did.
[19:15.99]Hold on.
[19:16.45]Let me just reset the machine.
[19:22.23]Just give me a second.
[19:24.55]Yeah, Windows was not shut down properly.
[19:26.57]I know.
[19:28.13]I know.
[19:31.96]Yeah, I understand.
[19:32.94]Just give me a minute for Windows to properly reinstall itself.
[19:40.56]I think Windows 98 got fucked up.
[19:45.15]No, there it goes.
[19:45.81]Okay.
[19:47.97]By the way, my password here is BumBum, if anyone was curious.
[19:55.04]Let's do it again.
[19:57.30]Why did I want to play this game so much?
[19:58.79]I didn't know.
[19:59.27]This is just like, this is display doctor.
[20:00.85]This is like, welcome to my shitty 98 computer.
[20:09.83]Your new computer uses Windows 98.
[20:11.25]No, this is a virtual machine.
[20:16.17]Virtual machine is that I'm running this on my new computer.
[20:20.19]It's a goofed operating system.
[20:22.17]It's not real.
[20:23.32]Well, it is real, but it's not real.
[20:24.46]It's a goof operating system.
[20:28.48]Alright, here we go.
[20:29.42]I'm gonna try this again.
[20:31.60]Play real life games.

[20:47.47]Alright, we're gonna do the Sunset Boulevard Deuce.
[20:55.00]Yeah.

[23:24.14]I got a pool cue shoved up his ass.
[23:26.01]Okay, yeah, I get you.
[23:27.17]Four days until the trial.
[23:30.38]Can we talk to him again?
[23:31.14]Let's see what he says this time.
[23:38.70]Okay, well, he doesn't care.
[23:42.98]Uh... I got a new message.
[23:50.25]What's the message?
[23:50.83]Oh, wait.
[23:54.57]No, no, no, no.
[23:55.13]Don't go back to this guy's office.
[23:56.33]I don't want to talk to this guy again.
[23:59.28]Okay, let me go to my office we go to the wall library I
[24:26.59]Wait, we gotta get a person in here.
[24:29.19]We'll get somebody else to like go like... Let's see.
[24:34.49]Can I sit down next to him?
[24:41.25]No, this guy's just a freeze frame.
[24:47.85]Keep going into his office, maybe he'll confess the... Detective 2, I forgot.
[24:55.84]I can live in this place.
[24:56.94]I don't understand why that's supposed to be me.
[25:00.00]Yeah, I know how to, I know.
[25:02.85]Let's actually listen to the rundown.
[25:04.37]You might have gotten a little rusty on that since you've been away.
[25:07.05]Why don't I just give you a little recap on how it works?
[25:09.09]I want to actually learn how to do this.
[25:11.73]The clock lets you know how much time you have before you have to go to trial.
[25:15.76]But you can always show up early if you think you're ready.
[25:19.08]First thing is the main menu, which shows you the different functions.
[25:24.10]The most important thing is the case constructor.
[25:30.82]This is where you organize your case for trial.
[25:33.62]As you go around checking out all the evidence and testimony, you take a digital picture of the stuff that looks relevant.
[25:39.96]And it shows up here in your toolbar.
[25:44.94]Anything that can be used as evidence, you can photograph with a digital camera.
[25:49.54]If the camera's there and doesn't work, it's because your toolbar is full.
[25:53.27]For each case, you have to prove two things.
[25:56.93]The first one is the identity.
[26:01.89]You have to show that the defendant is the person who committed the crime.
[26:09.83]All evidence and testimony that links the defendant to the crime scene should go here.
[26:15.32]The second is the criminal charge.
[26:17.72]You have to prove that each element of the charge against the defendant actually took place.
[26:22.45]Motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.
[26:24.42]Okay.
[26:26.66]Easy.
[26:30.21]So you click and you drag your evidence, testimony, and tests from the toolbar into the appropriate place like this.
[26:39.85]You can use the same piece of evidence more than once.
[26:43.07]You can clear anything you decide you don't want anymore by highlighting it and hitting clear.
[26:47.89]Cool.
[26:48.57]Got it.
[26:53.00]Legal by map.
[26:55.54]DA building, police station, crime scene, crime lab.
[26:59.26]Let's go to the coroner's office first.
[27:00.54]Fucking Bill Nye.
[27:05.74]Alright.
[27:06.12]Is this guy on the floor dead?
[27:06.99]This is the dead guy, right?
[27:08.33]Me talking again?
[27:09.39]Okay.
[27:09.69]Let's examine the body.
[27:11.37]Let's take some photos.
[27:26.68]I guess you hear about the Chinese kid from the bar cause of death in layman's terms is a bullet through the brain Okay, there's a number of contusions and abrasions including the strangulation marks on the throat, but he was alive I Guess you hear about the Chinese kid from the shit like I Guess you hear about the Chinese kid from how do I how?
[27:51.01]Alright, case constructor.
[27:53.77]So here we got, we have nothing.
[27:55.65]Okay.
[28:00.74]No, I don't want to hear this guy's dumb, shitty, corny intro again.
[28:03.38]Here we go.
[28:03.66]Alright, let's take a look over here.
[28:08.86]Scan it.
[28:09.24]Okay, evidence bag 125.
[28:10.68]Watch.
[28:12.16]M. Fong's watch.
[28:12.94]Corpse of Tommy Woo.
[28:14.08]Scan it.
[28:18.34]Got it.
[28:18.98]In my brain.
[28:19.72]Alright.
[28:19.96]Legal notebook.
[28:20.58]Case.
[28:21.38]Constructor.
[28:22.70]We got a watch.
[28:24.02]Yeah.
[28:25.06]Case for identity.
[28:27.18]We got a watch here.
[28:29.00]That's somebody's fucking watch.
[28:33.31]Okay.
[28:34.07]We're going strong.
[28:39.51]Let's go to trial with the watch.
[28:40.97]That's it.
[28:46.33]All I have is a watch.
[28:48.47]What did you bring to the evidence table, Mr. Detective?
[28:51.75]Ah, I got this guy's watch.
[28:54.03]I don't know if it means anything, but it's a nice watch.
[28:59.41]Mistrial.
[29:01.52]What about over here?
[29:04.08]They took his brain out?
[29:04.98]Why'd they take his brain out?
[29:06.00]That jar there contains the part of the brain called the cerebral cortex.
[29:11.00]That's the part of the brain that controls higher cognitive functions such as
[29:15.22]You're putting things in an ordered sequence.
[29:17.68]Okay.
[29:22.16]Who cares?
[29:23.28]Why do I need to know that?
[29:25.14]Is it the guy's balls?
[29:25.90]In that jar are some human eyes from a guy who died in ex- I thought that was the guy's balls.
[29:33.19]Is that the spleen?
[29:34.67]That jar contains two kidneys from a... Okay, I was wrong.
[29:37.89]And there is their... That's the stomach.
[29:41.37]You know, that jar has part of the brain called... Yeah, I was wrong every time.
[29:45.43]Okay.
[29:50.84]Uh... This looks like the case file.
[29:54.26]Let's open that up.
[29:57.15]House bar, homicide, wound to the head, entry point is center of forehead, exit point of crown, bullet fragment lodged in the skull, there's a contusion at the right thigh, right, I'll get a knife, right thigh, raisin, last raisin on the neck, one out of 16, there's 16 cuts on his neck, that's one of, that's one of them, along with swelling and two fractured ribs.
[30:17.59]Okay.
[30:20.59]Right, wait, there was more there.
[30:21.47]What else we got?
[30:27.01]There it is, let's scan that.
[30:33.06]That's what happens when you fail biology.
[30:36.72]Alright, let's scan this too.
[30:43.52]I love how we're just scanning this shit.
[30:45.88]I'm gonna come to trial with a bunch of nonsense.
[30:51.54]Sam Iverson, coroner.
[30:52.82]Alright, let's go.
[30:53.98]I got some evidence.
[30:57.65]I guess you're here about the Chinese kid.
[30:59.82]Yeah, okay.
[31:04.02]Alright, I got that done.
[31:09.15]I just took a bunch of, like, fucked up images.
[31:11.45]Legal notebook, let's go to the map.
[31:15.04]Uh, let's go case constructor.
[31:16.12]We're gonna make an identity here.
[31:18.30]Autopsy photos, case for identity.
[31:21.02]Let's get this up here.
[31:22.04]I mean, this is head and his thigh.
[31:24.52]Well, case for criminal act.
[31:25.52]I mean, like, killing of a human being.
[31:28.54]We got his head contuted.
[31:30.42]He's got a head contusion.
[31:31.69]And, uh, he did it because he stole the guy's fucking watch.
[31:34.77]He stole his watch, so he gave him a thigh and brain contusion.
[31:38.53]And then he killed him.
[31:39.43]So we're gonna put this over here.
[31:42.23]Uh, that means he's dead.
[31:45.29]So there you go.
[31:46.05]That's it with the intent to kill.
[31:47.11]He's dead.
[31:49.03]I think that's a pretty good case so far.
[31:51.55]Let's head over to the crime scene.
[31:55.62]Okay.
[31:58.14]I don't think I can do anything here.
[32:06.04]I cannot do anything here.
[32:09.19]Let's look at that notebook again.
[32:10.95]Let's question somebody at the police station.
[32:14.84]Oh, did we go to the jail too?
[32:17.37]Hey, how you doing, counselor?
[32:19.37]You got your work cut, I'll work you on this one.
[32:22.13]Do us a favor and get this kid off the streets, huh?

[32:27.06]Oh my god.
[32:31.66]Okay.
[32:32.00]Okay, evidence, records, and interrogation.
[32:35.68]We're gonna go to the interrogation room.
[32:39.33]See if we can figure out what's going on here.
[32:44.85]We have a suspect in here, right?
[32:46.51]Get in there.
[32:48.99]You got your work out for you.
[32:55.91]So we have to watch the interrogation tapes.
[32:58.90]Detective Gonzalez, Alien Brody.
[33:03.66]Let's take a look at a witness tape.
[33:06.68]Mr. Son.
[33:08.79]Can you tell me where you were at the time of the shooting?
[33:10.79]Let's see what Harold and Kumar have to say.
[33:12.37]I went outside for a smoke around that time, so I didn't really see anything.
[33:17.57]I ran back inside when I heard a shot, and that's when I found Tommy on the floor.
[33:23.21]Part of his head blown off.
[33:25.73]From what I understand, there was a pretty nasty fight going on before the shooting.
[33:30.77]You didn't hear any of that?
[33:32.55]No.
[33:33.71]I got suspenders.
[33:34.43]That's how you know I'm a detective.
[33:35.59]But it don't matter anyway.
[33:37.17]Oh, yeah?
[33:38.77]He's gonna smash his head into the fucking table.
[33:40.45]He's gonna grab his head and smash it into the table, just like an old, like, 1980s cop.
[33:45.02]Scan that, by the way.
[33:45.66]I'm gonna go into court with like, oh, by the way, I scanned with my fucking x-ray glasses the TV screen.

[41:51.40]I seen a microphone on the yard yesterday.
[41:54.34]Fuck.
[41:54.62]I don't know what made me think maybe I got something to turn him around.
[41:57.75]I can't even hear what he's saying.
[41:59.57]Some prior knowledge.
[42:01.03]Know what I'm talking about?
[42:02.23]What?
[42:03.85]Like six months ago, I heard the word on the street that some white child was moving through the hood.
[42:09.99]And something like that, it's best to go right to the runner that's got the hook up.
[42:15.23]It's a landline phone.
[42:17.13]Now, we had a bad deal with, it's a bad deal, it's a busy deal with the Tongs, but they was using gangs up front to choose things mostly.
[42:26.13]The Japanese was easier to understand.
[42:28.01]Oh, thanks for the info.
[42:29.25]Neither do I. So go find... This guy's going to be my mole?
[42:32.31]That's what I'm getting out of this?
[42:51.72]I didn't get any of that.
[42:52.73]I didn't get a fucking word.
[42:54.17]All I know is that he said he's gonna be my mole for me.
[42:58.73]Let's make sure we scan that!
[43:09.64]Get that over here somewhere.
[43:10.92]Alright.

[43:22.02]Where's the evidence?
[43:22.84]Uh-oh.
[43:27.54]I'm about to get, like, attacked in the office.
[43:28.98]What are you talking about?
[43:34.95]I'm not supposed to be here.
[43:41.77]You got a lineup for me yet?
[43:44.39]Sorry if you heard different, counselor, but there's no lineup scheduled.
[43:51.00]Okay.
[43:52.21]Well, at least I scanned that guy.

[44:01.68]Police station.
[44:04.14]Crime scene.
[44:04.62]Let's go back to the crime scene.
[44:05.92]I feel like I can scan something here.
[44:07.40]You know what I mean?
[44:09.97]There's something here that I can do.
[44:11.58]I definitely can scan something.
[44:14.12]Why would this exist?
[44:14.82]For no reason.
[44:16.38]It's gonna be like one of those hidden object games.
[44:19.00]It's gonna be like a bloody knife over here somewhere that I'm not seeing.
[44:21.50]Shit.
[44:26.33]I don't know.
[44:29.67]Okay.
[44:33.03]Uh, test order form.
[44:33.87]I don't know what this does.
[44:36.67]Fingerprint analysis.
[44:39.45]Submit that to the lab.
[44:41.77]Pick up results in two hours at the lab.
[44:43.94]Tool mark identification.
[44:45.82]Submit that to the lab too.
[44:48.60]Two hours.
[44:49.04]Alright, we got some good evidence here.
[44:50.84]Let's see if we can get some more legal advice.
[44:57.85]Have I supported each aspect of the charge against the defendant?
[45:03.17]I wouldn't say so, no.
[45:05.16]So bored do I need to order more tests for trial I Love that Can you imagine Sonic the Hedgehog coming in with like a detective cap on and like a suit sitting cross-legged?
[45:17.94]You know with like a leg up on the end with like a fucking he's got like a pen and paper and a clipboard I Could see them doing that.
[45:24.81]They've made so many stupid shit Sonic games that make no fucking sense He turned into a goddamn werewolf
[45:31.28]I mean, is it against the realm of possibility that Sonic Team would make him like a shitty detective?
[45:35.00]Like, it's probably gonna happen.
[45:36.52]Mark my words.
[45:38.96]Do I need more evidence for trial?
[45:40.70]Alright, let's go.
[45:44.72]Alright, let's go to the map.
[45:49.06]And let's take a look at the, uh... Uh... Go back to the crime lab.
[45:56.60]There she is.
[45:57.10]She's gonna go...
[46:00.19]By the way, she's eating a sandwich.
[46:02.02]How unsanitary.
[46:02.78]You're gonna fuck it all up.
[46:12.30]This lady is like Poki the pig.
[46:14.20]What's this?
[46:14.54]Fingerprint.
[46:15.32]Watch the finger- Watch fingerprint!
[46:16.64]What you're looking for when making a fingerprint match are pattern similarities.
[46:21.29]There are three patterns to look for.
[46:23.55]Arches, loops, and whorls.
[46:26.17]Narrow down your options by looking at the basic type of print.
[46:29.05]Ah, this looks pretty close here.
[46:29.99]What are the dominant patterns?
[46:31.79]Then you can get more specific and count and identify the ridges.
[46:35.49]Go ahead and take a shot.
[46:36.77]Try and make the match.
[46:37.99]This looks like- This looks pretty close to me here.
[46:40.14]Doesn't it?
[46:42.02]It's this one right here.
[46:44.86]There it is.
[46:45.70]That's a loop print.
[46:46.60]The index finger of Tommy Woo's right hand.
[46:48.60]That's Tommy Woo.
[46:49.41]He had the knife in his hand.
[46:50.57]Scan that.
[46:53.15]Hey, scan the thing.
[46:54.39]Scan the scan of the fingerprint scan that's on the computer.
[46:58.35]Okay.
[47:01.76]back here let's take a look at the uh the victim's thigh let's see if we can identify a tool here tools such as hammers screwdrivers drills and crowbars can be linked to marks left on door molding safes and window sashes we look on minute but corresponding imperfections engraved on the tools through manufacturing or use this method is also used when linking an implement to impressions found on a body
[47:27.11]Huh.
[47:27.85]I mean, this kind of looks like... Is it the horseshoe, or is it the wine glass?
[47:32.48]Or is it, like, the Gatorade bottle?
[47:34.80]What do you think he did?
[47:35.36]Did he think he smashed it with a Gatorade bottle?
[47:39.28]No, this is definitely not the Gatorade bottle.
[47:41.24]Um... I'm gonna say it's this one.
[47:45.07]Is it this one or this one?
[47:51.22]You got it.
[47:52.30]Mark on Tommy's leg is consistent with the boot that Michael Fong was wearing when he was arrested.
[47:58.98]Alright, let's open up the notebook.
[48:04.13]Let's get these scans in there.
[48:07.81]Case for identity.
[48:08.63]We've got some scans now.
[48:12.04]Yep.
[48:15.18]Case for identity.
[48:15.76]Case for murder.
[48:17.42]Case for criminal act.
[48:18.20]We got fingerprints now.
[48:21.20]And it was premeditated.
[48:23.08]And like with the intent to kill, he like fucking stomped on his thigh.
[48:25.93]I think that's pretty good.
[48:30.69]Okay, good.
[48:31.43]DA building.
[48:34.15]Jail.
[48:35.31]Let's go back to the coroner's office for a second.
[48:36.81]Got one day.
[48:42.31]I guess you're here about the Chinese.
[48:44.13]No, just stay here.
[48:45.47]Let him talk.
[48:46.07]I guess you're here about the Chinese kid from the bar.
[48:49.13]Cause of death in layman's terms.
[48:51.05]I got a lot of phone messages.
[48:53.77]There's a number of contusions and abrasions including the strangulation marks on the throat.
[48:58.91]But he was alive when the shooting occurred.
[49:05.05]Scan him.
[49:05.81]I can't scan him.
[49:06.57]Alright, let's go back.
[49:07.90]I gotta go to my phone.
[49:12.31]I'm going to go get up.
[49:17.93]Why is this called the rat tattoo, by the way?
[49:25.16]Yeah, that's not a strangulation.
[49:27.72]That is somebody who, like, stabbed him.
[49:30.16]I need to go listen to my phone.
[49:32.12]Let's see what the messages are.
[49:39.97]Make sure we don't miss anything.
[49:42.51]There we go.

[59:17.71]Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Tommy Woo was a pretty person with thoughts, dreams, and ideals.
[59:24.89]This is me talking.
[59:26.07]Here's Sonic the Hedgehog.
[59:29.03]Walking around.
[59:29.67]When Tommy was murdered in cold blood by the defendant, Michael Fong.
[59:35.68]You will hear in the testimony of Cindy Lee Chen how the defendant came into Hal's bar with a group of Chu Sing gang members and headed straight for Tommy Woo.
[59:45.21]You will hear how Tommy was choked with a steel cable and dragged to the floor.
[59:51.65]The defendant is charged with first-degree murder.
[59:54.19]The evidence will show he is guilty of this charge.
[59:56.98]Walking back and forth, like moving his hands around.
[59:58.84]Oh, god damn it.
[60:05.17]I can't wait to put the third disk in.
[60:16.05]By the way, what does this have to do with rats?
[60:19.86]Did I miss that?
[60:20.56]Did I miss the entire rat tattoo arc of the whole stream?
[60:26.40]I had to have.
[60:27.68]There was probably like a whole huge story about the rat tattoo.
[60:30.40]Alright, here we go.

[63:17.22]Miss Chen, independent of anything you have witnessed between the date of the shooting and today, do you see the person in the court that took the gun?
[63:22.65]No, because that's the same thing.
[63:25.55]The lineup you participated in made you more confident that the defendant was the person in the court that took the gun and shot Tommy Woo, didn't it?
[63:32.77]The lineup you participated in made you more confident that the defendant was the person in court that took the gun and shot Tommy Woo, didn't it?

[64:23.08]I lose son.
[64:23.78]Bring him up here.
[64:24.29]At this time, the people call Mr. Son to the stand.

[64:39.41]Mr. Sun, when did you first realize that the defendant intended to kill Tommy Woo?

[66:57.28]We're finished.
[66:58.22]We got him dead to rights.
[67:00.74]I'm done with this witness.
[67:02.57]No more questions, Your Honor.
[67:04.97]We already got him dead, right?
[67:05.87]Mr. Blaine?
[67:08.68]I have no questions at this time, Your Honor.
[67:10.96]The guy doesn't even have... He's just wearing frames.
[67:12.98]You may step down.
[67:14.10]He's wearing frames.
[67:17.81]Let's call the last witness.

[67:19.75]The people call Sam Iverson to the stand.
[67:24.20]Please state your name and quality.

[67:25.66]There's a creepy Bill Nye wannabe.
[67:27.14]My name is Sam Iverson.
[67:29.02]I am a coroner.
[67:30.72]I have an expertise in the area of forensic pathology.
[67:36.27]Nice.
[67:38.45]Is it true?
[67:39.35]Are you a fucking creep?
[67:41.57]Yes, I am a creep.
[67:42.73]I am a fucking creep.
[67:44.01]Okay.
[67:45.49]Mr. Iverson, are these photographs typical of gang-related murders?
[67:50.74]Mr. Iverson, would these photographs...
[67:54.95]Tell me about these photographs.
[67:56.79]Mr. Iverson, can you tell me about these photographs?
[68:01.35]Those are pictures I took of the deceased.
[68:04.29]Oh, no.
[68:09.01]I moved to suppress these photographs.
[68:10.98]They're being offered by the prosecutor just to inflame the passions of the jury.
[68:14.96]No.
[68:16.22]Dismiss that.
[68:17.26]Counselors, please approach the bench.
[68:20.64]What?
[68:23.16]What the fuck is this?
[68:25.80]What's your legal response?
[68:27.48]What are you talking about?
[68:28.52]I'm not trying to shock jock the fucking jury.
[68:30.68]What are you talking about?
[68:32.86]Oh no, I don't know this shit.
[68:34.36]Evidence code section 210?
[68:35.30]How the fuck am I supposed to know this?
[68:43.33]I don't want to read any legal documents.
[68:51.41]It's two, right?
[68:54.84]It's gotta be two.
[68:59.67]Literally need to be a lawyer.
[69:01.34]Yeah, it's two.
[69:04.40]Photographs which have been authenticated as accurate were admitted as evidence when relevant.
[69:10.12]Excuse me.
[69:10.42]According to People V. Bowley, the photograph should be admitted because they are relevant and authenticated as accurate.
[69:18.83]Come on.
[69:20.33]Counselor, the two photographs will not be admitted.
[69:23.49]What?!
[69:25.71]What the fuck?! !
[69:27.96]Why?
[69:28.36]Oh, my God.
[69:39.29]Mr. Iverson, Mr. Iverson, did you take this photograph during your autopsy of Tommy?
[69:43.69]I'm not getting destroyed.
[69:46.49]Yes, it's a picture I took of the contusion on the victim's left thigh, which was badly bruised.
[69:52.73]Yeah, badly bruised, huh?
[69:55.11]That's right.
[69:58.05]No more questions, your honor.
[70:03.03]Mr. Blaine?
[70:04.07]This guy never asks questions.
[70:06.05]I have no questions at this time.
[70:07.47]I just like make a smug look on my face with my frames on.
[70:10.42]You may step down.
[70:11.36]And I'm just here for like a background character to look and laugh at the player when they do a bad thing.
[70:17.60]That's it.
[70:19.42]Legal notebook.
[70:21.06]We got our case here.
[70:22.06]Our case is here.
[70:24.72]We're ready to go.
[70:26.79]I rest my case.
[70:28.69]At this time, your honor, the people rest.
[70:32.05]God, we had to put the fucking third disk in for the goddamn... They did this for, like, suspense purposes.
[70:43.60]You know that, right?
[70:44.18]It's like, oh, I wonder... Did I win?
[70:48.74]Did I beat the game?
[70:51.58]I gotta put the third disk in?
[70:57.94]Alright, let's try it.
[70:59.58]I'm going to go pee regardless and come back after this, regardless of what the fucking verdict is.
[71:04.38]This is just like the O.J.
[71:05.30]Simpson trial where everybody had their TVs on.
[71:09.72]Just like the O.J.
[71:10.36]Simpson trial, there's like 1,800.
[71:11.30]There's like 1,900 TVs on right now.
[71:14.06]Here we go.
[71:16.22]Your Honor, I would like to make a motion to dismiss this case due to the insufficiency of the evidence.
[71:22.01]No.
[71:22.31]Motion granted, Mr. Blaine.
[71:24.43]Counselor, if you aren't going to do your homework...
[71:30.51]I got fucking 0%.
[71:31.91]How?
[71:39.56]You're not even going to give me like 1% on this case?
[71:44.04]Really?
[71:44.54]Like that's... That's a goddamn shame.
[71:47.00]Oh god.
[71:49.80]Fucking break.
[71:54.03]All that guy did was make faces.
[71:55.45]He didn't even... That guy didn't present any evidence.
[72:01.62]I love the guy that has no evidence.
[72:04.10]Don't worry.
[72:05.24]Shut up.
[72:10.48]Sometimes this happens when you have a weak case.
[72:13.31]All you can do is climb back and the horse will throw you.
[72:20.95]I can't even do the other ones.
[72:24.15]What the fuck?

[75:22.36]Why would you not want me to know that you gave a hundred dollars with your Ultra Kappa?
[75:30.61]I got $100 for peeing.
[75:33.80]Well, thank you.
[75:36.32]Thank you for your $100, Rampaging Scrub.

[76:02.57]But, really, thank you so much for the hundred bucks.
[76:04.61]Even though I, uh, I found out.
[76:07.69]Uh, thank you also to the Gaming Pug for three bucks.

[77:52.43]This is a Windows 98 stream.
[77:54.37]Uh, program files.

[79:00.27]Maybe that's what it has to be.
[79:02.89]Hold on a minute.
[79:03.41]What happens if I do that?
[79:05.35]It might be like on the second disk.
[79:09.14]Let's try that.
[79:10.10]I'm curious.
[79:11.46]We're going to put like disk two in.
[79:15.97]We're going to put in disk two and see if I can open the second thing.
[79:27.70]I'm curious about that.
[79:28.46]I wonder if that happens.
[79:30.60]That made a lot of fucking awful noise.
[79:32.10]I don't know why.

[88:51.50]I'm done with those tests, you...
[88:55.59]Alright, we're good.
[88:56.13]Let's take a look.
[88:57.43]Look at all this info.
[88:58.05]Look, we only had two last time.
[88:59.39]Fingerprint knife.
[89:02.16]Uh, it's this one right here.
[89:04.50]Yep.
[89:05.56]Nope.
[89:05.96]Try again.
[89:09.08]Uh.
[89:12.64]Oh, it isn't that one.
[89:13.32]Which one is it?
[89:14.36]This one?
[89:17.28]It's so pixelated, I can't even fucking tell.
[89:20.16]It's this one.
[89:22.48]You spotted it.
[89:23.40]That's a loop print.
[89:24.28]The index finger of Michael Fong's right hand.
[89:26.92]There it is.
[89:31.06]Okay.
[89:32.30]Scan that.
[89:36.26]Let's get the gun too.
[89:39.05]Uh, there it is.
[89:39.67]Where is it?
[89:40.61]Right here.
[89:43.03]Right?
[89:44.77]Yep.
[89:45.80]That's the match.
[89:46.82]The right index fingerprint of Michael Fong.
[89:49.46]He definitely had his hands on that gun.
[89:51.70]Yes, he did.
[89:52.04]You should know that Tommy Woof's fingerprints were all over that gun too, which I guess follows since it was his weapon.
[89:57.79]Is that Dan?
[90:02.21]Is there a penalty for just clicking until you get it right?
[90:04.19]I hope not.
[90:07.43]Marking pen?
[90:08.27]This is somebody else's fingerprint.
[90:13.87]That's the one.
[90:14.86]That's an arch print.
[90:15.74]The middle finger of Michael Fong's right hand.
[90:18.02]We're going in here with so much evidence this time, guys.
[90:23.43]There's no way we're going to lose it.
[90:26.75]Hairs and fibers are frequently found at the scene of a crime.
[90:30.55]Even one strand of hair yields a wealth of information.
[90:33.81]Factors such as color, structure, pigmentation are taken into account.
[90:38.39]Still, the best I can do is to say that a sample is consistent with another example because there is no known way to positively link a strand of hair to a particular individual.
[90:48.06]But it can help you narrow down your field of suspects.
[90:51.04]So give it a try.
[90:52.32]Which example do you think best matches the sample?
[90:54.63]This one right here.
[90:56.99]Good eye, Counselor.
[90:58.80]That's a strand of Michael Fong hair.
[91:00.32]You better start counting your days, Fong.
[91:01.38]You can see by the structural similarities of the two strands that the sample which was found caught on Fong's gold chain is consistent with the exemplar that Fong provided.
[91:09.90]Scan it.
[91:12.26]I'm coming.
[91:12.66]Look, I'm gonna have a fucking... Oh.
[91:15.28]Counselor, ready or not, you're due in court ASAP.
[91:17.70]Wait, what are you talking about?
[91:18.64]I'm looking forward to hearing that justice was done.
[91:20.80]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[91:22.51]What?
[91:23.87]What are you talking about?
[91:28.22]I had so much more time last time.
[91:30.69]What?
[91:32.01]Oh my god.
[91:32.95]Okay.
[91:34.87]Fingerprints.
[91:35.93]Fingerprint.
[91:37.21]Marking pen.
[91:38.71]Hair and fiber ID.
[91:41.53]You gotta be shitting me.
[91:44.71]I spent three days in the lab?
[91:46.39]I spent longer than that.
[91:49.66]Oh, come on.
[91:50.46]This is fucking terrible.
[91:52.86]Gun, gun.
[91:53.44]Where's his neck?
[92:11.88]I don't understand like what the fuck happened Wrong fingerprint on the pen get this pen out of here clear it Premeditated

[93:03.44]I don't even know.
[93:04.14]I didn't have enough time to think about this.
[93:08.30]This is nothing I have pre-meditation.
[93:18.63]Let's just go to fucking trial.
[93:19.71]I don't even care.
[93:21.49]Let's go.
[93:25.71]We're done.
[93:26.79]How do I get out of here?
[93:29.01]Oh, I need to have something there.
[93:30.47]Here, premeditated.
[93:31.37]Like, you were in the fucking parking lot for a minute.
[93:33.04]Okay, there's your fucking ring.
[93:42.30]There's your hair.
[93:46.87]How do I get out of here?
[93:50.13]I don't even care.
[93:53.45]Let's go.
[93:59.95]I lost audio.
[94:04.31]There's no audio anymore.
[94:05.51]The audio's gone.
[94:07.89]We have to go by our instinct now to see if we can win.
[94:17.07]What if I insert disk 3?
[94:19.49]Will I win?
[94:24.66]I gotta go back and turn on the audio.
[94:28.40]What happened?
[94:31.95]He sat there and smiled for a minute.
[94:41.47]I didn't already lose, did I?
[94:48.15]No.
[94:48.63]I had enough evidence to put somebody on the stand.
[94:51.35]Don't I?
[94:51.59]Hopefully we get the audio back.
[94:59.59]I'm so hungry right now.
[95:01.32]It's fucking crazy.
[95:02.30]Okay, witnesses.
[95:15.01]Sound.
[95:23.29]Where's my... This audio is just gone.
[95:27.22]We don't have it.
[95:32.54]What's going on?
[95:37.83]Nobody came up to the stand.
[95:50.52]I don't even have any questions for her.
[96:01.08]I wish I could hear what anybody was saying.
[96:02.50]This is fucking stupid.
[96:04.26]I think he has a question.
[96:07.32]We're not gonna even be able to hear what it is.
[96:12.66]You want me to voice act this?
[96:14.08]It's gonna be hard.
[96:18.26]Objection.
[96:18.94]Oh yeah, something went wrong.
[96:20.42]Something for sure.
[96:21.08]Look at this smug motherfucker.
[96:24.82]Yeah, you ran out of video RAM, didn't ya?
[96:32.21]God.
[96:34.69]What do you have to say for yourself?
[96:35.85]Anything?
[96:40.16]I wasn't talking to anyone.
[96:41.30]Alright, let's get Michael Gonzalez up there.
[96:54.93]What the fuck?
[96:55.51]I can't do anything.
[96:56.43]Alright, let's talk about the knife.
[96:59.33]Let's talk about the rat tattoo.
[97:05.66]Do you recognize the tattoo in this photograph?
[97:08.72]Yeah.
[97:15.61]What?
[97:17.37]He just blinked a bunch of times and that was it.
[97:21.03]Okay, thanks for answering my question.
[97:27.16]Uh... Based on your expertise as a gang investigator, do you have any opinions on that?
[97:36.18]No, he's just going to blink at me.
[97:39.10]This guy communicates through blinking.
[97:40.40]I don't know what that means.
[97:42.32]Okay.
[97:45.37]Good.
[97:49.53]Okay, I just got an objection.
[97:50.59]Objection, your honor.
[97:51.95]We changed the white balance in the video camera.
[97:54.55]Something went wrong here and you can't say that.
[97:56.41]You can't say it's gang related.
[97:58.36]How dare you say those words.
[98:01.34]Fuck you.
[98:02.32]Fuck you.
[98:04.22]Fuck you too.
[98:08.25]I'm gonna... Here I am gonna... Oh my god.
[98:15.03]I'm not putting the third disk in.
[98:17.89]I'm not gonna do it.
[98:21.13]Nope.
[98:22.53]I'm not putting the... Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[98:26.58]Which one of these is it?
[98:32.38]I didn't lose yet.
[98:36.00]Okay, those of you guys that are lawyers, which one of these is it?
[98:41.38]Trying to outdo the Skate 3 stream.
[98:43.62]No, I wanted to play that.
[98:44.38]I'm having a good time.
[98:50.85]It's 3?
[98:54.95]I need a lawyer to tell me what it is.
[98:56.55]2.
[99:00.33]Go for the biggest.
[99:00.95]Go for the longest, most high-winded one.
[99:10.07]One.
[99:10.55]One.
[99:10.71]We're going with one.
[99:14.13]Okay.
[99:14.75]Hmm.
[99:16.52]Hmm.
[99:19.76]Hmm.
[99:22.60]Hmm.
[99:25.48]Hmm.
[99:27.46]Hmm.
[99:39.96]Hmm.
[99:42.78]Hmm.
[99:46.76]Mr. Striker, you know I'm going to allow that to be prosecuted into the case.
[99:54.45]Fuck!
[100:04.19]I think we got it right.
[100:08.57]Yeah Yeah, I mean that is one of the things you would We would put it forward if the knife was relevant It's I can't voice act this because it's it freezes every two seconds
[100:28.11]And the water next to me is a little warm.
[100:30.07]I would have appreciated a little bit colder of a temperature.
[100:36.58]But, you know, I'm not going to be complaining about that very much.
[100:40.04]I just want to let you know that I have a... It's not possible.
[100:47.41]There's nothing I can do about this.
[100:50.95]Oh, and they got Bernie Sanders sitting there contemplating the case.
[100:54.73]I wonder if this was a murder.
[100:57.39]Because if it was, I hope they go to trial and I will be on the jury for that one.
[101:02.61]I promise you.
[101:06.45]I don't know what's happening.
[101:09.21]This guy's very long-windedly talking about this.
[101:16.87]You guys wish you could know what was going on?
[101:25.54]I think I win.
[101:28.76]Did I win?
[101:30.10]I don't know.
[101:30.44]Alright, well, let's talk about the knife now.
[101:33.62]Detective Gonzalez, please tell the court what you know about butterfly knives.
[101:36.18]Are they used in gang conflicts?
[101:38.96]Can you tell when this butterfly knife was booked into evidence?
[101:43.64]Hmm.
[102:04.54]Yes, I was booked into evidence not that long ago, probably.
[102:19.35]Okay, I'm done with you.
[102:35.28]Any more witnesses for you, my friend?
[102:39.56]Okay, you're free to go.
[102:40.62]Thanks for coming over.
[102:46.38]We got one more.
[102:47.03]We got Christina Travers.
[102:50.93]I would restart this, but I feel like we have a pretty strong case right now.
[102:58.59]Christina Travers, please get up to the stand there.
[103:07.26]She came in too fast.
[103:09.74]She came in way too fast.
[103:11.22]I don't even know what she said.
[103:13.88]Who knows?
[103:14.92]Alright, we got a lot of things to say here.
[103:16.18]Fingerprint gun.
[103:19.56]Isn't the fact that the defendant wiped his fingerprints off on the murder weapon an indication of his guilt?
[103:23.08]No, that's objection.
[103:24.04]That's leading.
[103:25.92]Did you attempt a fingerprint identification on the weapon found at the crime scene?
[103:29.06]I like that one.
[103:32.02]What were the conditions under which the fingerprint identification was performed?
[103:52.66]Why does everybody give me the death stare?
[103:54.80]Objection.
[104:00.89]I don't like this very much.
[104:02.89]You watch it.
[104:04.13]You do one more mistake like that and I'm going to end the game.
[104:08.33]What the fuck did I do?
[104:09.13]I don't even understand what I did.
[104:14.35]Here.
[104:16.51]Did you attempt a fingerprint identification?
[104:19.95]I did.
[104:21.59]And I also identified that I have fucking clown hair.
[104:27.45]Yes, I do have clown hair.
[104:29.31]Oh, thank you for saying that, me.
[104:32.01]I love this.
[104:35.84]How does this fingerprint analysis damage the defendant's self?
[104:38.94]I sound like I'm shit-faced right now.
[104:42.80]Did you concur with your fingerprint analysis on the defendant's butterfly knife?
[104:51.00]RIP Yakuza 0, that's not true.
[104:53.12]I'm just waiting till I have the internal capture card.
[104:58.38]Yeah, they're listening to me talk, that's right.
[105:03.50]I'm gonna go with 2, or 3.
[105:07.90]It's either 3 or 2.
[105:11.34]I'm gonna say 3.
[105:17.87]Did you perform a fingerprint analysis?
[105:23.93]It's like not loading the next video clip after this.
[105:27.27]Like the whole game is broken, but I think that's gonna... Yes, I did.
[105:29.53]Okay.
[105:32.45]Hair and fiber ID gold chain.
[105:40.04]Please describe the analysis, please.
[105:42.96]Well, let's just pretend that she did.
[105:46.26]She just said, yes, I did twice.
[105:47.52]Okay, whatever.
[105:55.19]I don't even know what this means.
[106:02.65]No, we're going to get another objection and I'm going to get fucking thrown out of court.
[106:06.91]Don't throw me out of court.
[106:08.49]Don't do it.
[106:09.41]Don't like call me up and be like a fucking mean parent and be like an upset parent with me.
[106:14.78]I told you not to do that.
[106:16.30]Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[106:17.66]I think I got it.
[106:18.26]I think I'm good.
[106:19.74]Yeah, I'm good.
[106:27.28]Why was the defendant holding this marking pen?
[106:31.42]She just says yes.
[106:36.54]She just says yes.
[106:37.36]Yes, I did.
[106:38.04]She's going to say yes, I did again.
[106:39.26]Yes, I did.
[106:41.68]And that's it.
[106:42.84]Okay, bye.
[106:43.58]Thanks for playing.
[106:47.05]Wait a minute.
[106:47.37]We got a fucking issue here.
[106:53.29]Oh my god.
[106:53.91]I wish I could hear anything.
[106:57.83]We got one more witness.
[106:59.15]It's Sam Iverson.
[107:03.47]This is RIP.
[107:05.65]I'm so hungry.
[107:06.64]It's going to drive me crazy.
[107:08.96]That stupid fucking pizza guy.
[107:10.86]This guy eating the pizza right here.
[107:16.64]Autopsy of the head.
[107:21.43]Tell me about these photographs.
[107:24.67]Look at how fucking happy he is.
[107:26.27]Yeah, they're really gruesome, aren't they?
[107:28.38]I love this one in particular.
[107:34.50]Now they get grossed out, and this is where I have to let them see it in court.
[107:37.26]Bernie Sanders is pissed about it.
[107:41.21]All these extras that made like 40 bucks stay in here for like 12 hours.
[107:44.77]I've done that before.
[107:45.51]It sucks.
[107:47.19]Okay, which one is it?
[107:49.61]I have to tell him why this is allowed.
[107:53.29]Which one is it?
[107:58.37]I got this wrong last time.
[108:02.15]This is the wrong one.
[108:03.17]It's one of these two.
[108:08.55]Relevant evidence means evidence including evidence relevant to the credibility of the witness having any tendency and reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact that is consequence the determined data.
[108:17.05]This is the most wordy mouthful shitty lawyer answer.
[108:22.15]So it's probably two.
[108:27.27]This one is the, this said three words in four sentences.
[108:32.39]So this is probably the correct answer.
[108:47.10]Call the lawyer and ask him.
[108:48.28]I am the lawyer.
[108:52.30]He's gonna let me keep it, right?
[108:54.36]I have no idea if we're gonna be able to tell by the look on this guy's face.
[108:57.34]If he smiles, it means we didn't get it.
[109:00.65]No, it means we didn't get it.
[109:02.13]We didn't get it.
[109:06.05]He did the condescending whistle.
[109:07.81]We didn't get it.
[109:16.31]Tell me about hair.
[109:17.35]Oh, shit!
[109:20.78]Tell me about hair.
[109:22.84]Oh, you see.
[109:23.46]Hair.
[109:26.91]He just, like, burped.
[109:27.71]Oh, my God.
[109:32.11]What's going on?
[109:32.71]I was trying... If I could hear what they're saying.
[109:38.44]He doesn't have any hair.
[109:46.28]This guy's an expert in hair.
[109:49.85]That's such a mean jab.
[109:51.57]Hey buddy, I know you're fucking bald, but hey, tell me about hair.
[109:55.91]You seem to be such an expert.
[109:57.59]What happened?
[109:59.79]I'm getting sternly talked to, I think.
[110:04.84]Did you collect this hair sample?
[110:06.08]How does this hair incriminate the defendant?
[110:10.54]Ugh.
[110:15.23]It's probably three.
[110:16.35]I don't even fucking know.
[110:17.79]I'm about to like go eat food.
[110:22.21]That's not two.
[110:23.73]Two is just so easy.
[110:25.33]Two is, it's probably, it's three.
[110:29.15]Two is just a simple question.
[110:30.57]Did you collect this hair?
[110:31.91]Yes, I did.
[110:36.74]Ask him about hair.
[110:38.62]Can we have a recess?
[110:39.60]No, I can't do that.
[110:41.22]Three is leading.
[110:42.00]Alright, whatever.
[110:47.97]Okay, hopefully that worked.
[110:53.24]Tell me about hair.
[110:54.00]Alright, finish with a witness.
[110:55.72]Let's put in disk three and fucking lose.
[110:57.69]Can't wait.
[111:04.80]Here we go, guys.
[111:06.14]Uh, you have any questions?
[111:07.08]No, you don't.
[111:08.30]I have no questions for the witness.
[111:10.88]So let's, okay, let's end the fucking trial and let me lose.
[111:14.69]Uh, there's no more witnesses.
[111:15.63]I can't, like, I didn't know that it was going to take five fucking seconds.
[111:21.11]And we're going to get zero percent again.
[111:22.49]That's, that's fantastic.
[111:27.08]Yeah, it's a rat movie three.
[111:28.60]Okay.
[111:28.90]Okay.
[111:37.20]I know I'm going to lose, but I better not get 1%.
[111:39.22]And here we go.
[111:53.04]Let me put a whole disk in for you to tell me I lose.
[111:54.72]That's good.
[111:57.86]What is he saying?
[111:59.52]Oh, let's dismiss the case.
[112:02.02]I'm going to dismiss the case.
[112:03.10]Yes, we are.
[112:03.68]There's no evidence.
[112:04.40]Yeah, I got you.
[112:07.02]Get fucked.
[112:08.90]Oh, you lose.
[112:11.47]It's gonna be 0% again.
[112:24.61]I just wanna... I just want... Just save this.
[112:33.13]Maybe I can like...
[112:40.36]If I knew that it was gonna take that long to scan evidence... We did better the first time.
[112:46.09]Alright, I might just go eat food.
[112:47.83]I'm gonna die.
[112:48.37]I haven't eaten anything like all day.
[112:50.99]Alright, so here's what we're gonna do.
[112:57.61]Tomorrow's stream... No, I'm not done yet.
[113:01.45]We're not done with this.
[113:07.14]Come on, give me another case.
[113:10.39]fucker I don't know why I can't do these why would the third one be available alright uh so tomorrow's stream is gonna be long I'm gonna start probably a little earlier tomorrow and go for like five hours tomorrow because this was a short stream I'm only like about two hours so I want to go for like five-ish hours tomorrow and like everything just crashed again
[113:37.93]Real life games.
[113:39.78]They're so good.
[113:41.48]Now things are all fucking up.
[113:44.76]I'll probably start tomorrow at like six instead of seven.
[113:48.58]Like five-ish, six-ish.
[113:52.57]And we will do a lot of things tomorrow.
[113:57.15]There's a couple of things I want to do in particular.
[114:01.87]Eat ass tomorrow.
[114:02.80]What?
[114:04.74]Well, I hope you enjoyed, uh, The Pursuit of Justice.
[114:07.64]It was a... Yeah, I liked that game.
[114:12.61]If I could only beat it.
[114:15.63]If I could only beat that game.
[114:16.75]That was a fun game, though.
[114:19.01]The Neverhood?
[114:19.57]I would love to stream The Neverhood.
[114:21.29]It's gonna be really hard, though.
[114:24.37]Although I do have this, like, Windows 98 shit.
[114:26.47]Just need to do some more nuances to it.
[114:31.02]It was terrible.
[114:32.04]The game was terrible.
[114:34.74]Well, how was I supposed to know?
[114:36.76]You know, sometimes we need to find out if a fucking Pursuit of Justice game is any good.
[114:40.62]It was a good game.
[114:42.10]That game came out like fucking 20 years ago.
[114:46.99]Armikrog, I beat Armikrog on stream.
[114:49.61]The same day it came out.
[114:53.80]Anyways, guys, yeah, we'll do a long stream tomorrow.
[114:56.60]Because for me to change what I'm doing right now, it's going to require me to turn the stream off.
[115:05.63]Because I have to change sources and change audio input delay and stuff.
[115:09.41]So I can't really do that.
[115:11.13]And I'm starving.
[115:12.41]So we'll go long tomorrow.
[115:13.83]We'll go for about four or five hours plus tomorrow and see where we are.
[115:17.98]But thanks, everybody, for watching.
[115:19.80]Hopefully you enjoyed it.
[115:21.65]And I'll see you guys soon.
[115:23.13]Take care, everybody, of course.
[115:25.53]And have a good rest of your night.
[115:27.63]And have a good night.
[115:29.32]And goodbye.
[115:30.26]And see you later.
[115:31.72]Night, guys.

[117:01.86]It's the baby of the brass section.
[117:04.00]It wasn't around for 200 years or more after
[117:13.32]It's basically a long coiled up tube.
[117:17.16]Now, I could tell you the length of this tuber.
[117:18.90]It's about 18 feet.
[117:20.67]But I have three tubers, and they're all different lengths.
