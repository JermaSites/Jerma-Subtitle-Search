[00:41.53]Hey, what's up?
[00:43.57]What's going on, everybody?
[00:44.41]How you doing?
[00:46.71]I'm a little tired.
[00:47.39]I'm, like, just kind of tired.
[00:50.71]I got, um... I didn't get very much sleep last night, so I'm, like, really, really just, like, fucking sleepy, you know what I mean?
[00:57.32]I wasn't, like, feeling that well either, so... Just, like, I'm gonna be, like... So that's gonna be a high-energy stream tonight, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:11.73]You're already up for fucking high energy.
[01:14.08]Sleepy?
[01:14.60]Don't think so.
[01:15.76]I haven't slept in fucking six days.
[01:17.24]You know what that's like?
[01:18.42]I'm seeing colors and shit.
[01:26.21]Give me a second.
[01:26.69]By the way, I had a full night's sleep.
[01:31.71]Don't worry, I'm fine.
[01:32.79]See ya.
[02:44.79]Alright, let me just make this tweet.
[02:48.05]And we can get all along with our lives here.
[02:49.97]We're gonna play Yakuza 0 tonight.
[02:52.13]We're gonna start Yakuza 0.
[02:55.37]I don't know very much about Yakuza.
[02:56.97]I only know that it seems fun.
[02:59.15]Look, this might be a one and done.
[03:00.59]We might just try this for tonight and see if it's any fun.
[03:02.57]I might play this on Thursday and Friday.
[03:04.69]I don't know.
[03:05.03]It really depends on how much fun I have.
[03:07.87]I've heard it's fairly slow to start.
[03:10.77]So, you know, we're going to have to give it a little bit.
[03:13.59]We're going to have to give it like an hour or so.
[03:16.64]I've heard it really picks up after the first hour.
[03:18.66]I have never played a Yakuza game in my life.
[03:22.96]Not one time.
[03:24.18]So this is an experience that I'm going to share with all of you.
[03:26.86]Let me just make my Twitter.com.
[03:39.93]That's a pretty good tweet.
[03:41.39]ikuzazerowe Trying some new stream settings by the way, so hopefully the stream can hold up So we're doing this is like also a test
[04:05.33]Let's turn this off.
[04:07.17]Come on over here.
[04:08.37]Hey, come on over to the Yakuza stream.
[04:10.81]There we go.
[04:11.17]There's Yakuza.
[04:13.45]Hopefully everything's all set.
[04:18.33]Character movement's a little weird.
[04:19.31]Eh, whatever.
[04:20.53]We're gonna give it a try.
[04:24.29]So, here we go.
[04:27.40]I don't want to waste any time here.
[04:29.02]Because I know that there's a lot of cutscenes.
[04:31.48]It's a cutscene-heavy game.
[04:33.16]So if you didn't sign up to watch a fucking movie... Well, I'm here at the kiosk and I'm handing you your ticket now.
[04:40.41]Here it is.
[04:42.17]One ticket to see Yakuza 0.
[04:44.63]There it is.
[04:44.97]That'll be $17.
[04:47.26]By the way, you need to be 17 or older to watch this game.
[04:50.58]And it's 17 years old.
[04:52.00]I want to do it on the exact day.
[04:56.94]Here we go.
[04:58.76]New game.
[04:59.40]We're going to just do it on normal.
[05:01.29]No bullshit.
[05:02.87]Enjoy the movie, everyone.
[05:03.79]Please be quiet.
[05:06.19]Quiet yourselves.
[05:07.35]Because here comes the opening cutscene to Yakuza 0.
[05:11.25]How do you mute the streamer?
[05:12.27]You don't.
[05:12.79]I'm in charge here.
[05:16.15]No talking during the movie.
[05:28.80]Damn.
[05:28.96]Fuck.
[06:00.58]Hold on.
[06:02.76]I can't fucking talk right now.
[06:06.12]Hello?
[06:08.46]Yeah, I can't talk to you right now.
[06:12.22]I'm watching a fucking movie.
[06:13.42]Don't you know never to call somebody during a movie?
[06:17.82]A guy just got kicked in the face.
[06:20.98]Don't ever fucking come...
[06:25.06]You guys like that one?
[06:37.11]See?
[06:37.31]He's got his phone.
[06:37.89]He picked up his phone.
[06:40.65]That wasn't a phone.
[06:41.29]That was a wallet.
[06:43.19]That looked like a big phone case.
[06:44.52]There could be a phone in there.
[06:45.48]Check it.
[06:45.88]Shut up!
[06:46.06]Why am I talking?
[07:02.43]If I want to turn the game up, I can do that.
[07:04.71]The game's a little quiet.
[07:07.31]How about now?
[07:10.39]Probably better.
[07:12.11]Hopefully better.
[07:12.73]I haven't been watching any of this, by the way.
[07:29.83]Something about a pizza?
[07:31.50]What did he say?
[07:32.68]Oh you touched the wrong guy.
[08:04.60]And by the way, you owe me an apology.
[08:06.72]And easy on those french fries and the ketchup.
[08:08.68]You got it all over your face.
[08:09.88]Okay, fuck it.
[08:17.31]He needs to learn some manners at McDonald's.
[08:20.21]I'm sorry.
[08:40.12]You hope I hate this?
[08:41.02]Why do you hope I hate this?
[08:45.02]Oh, by the way, I can't hear any notifications.
[08:49.10]So I'm going to have to be checking that periodically.
[08:50.72]I'll be looking over at it.
[08:52.81]I cannot hear my desktop audio.
[08:54.51]I have my headphones plugged into my screen.
[08:57.35]There's a whole bunch of reasons why.
[08:58.53]And I'm going to get in, like, Hugh Hefner's limo.
[09:00.55]And we're going to talk about, like, the loan shark.
[09:03.76]Why is this guy not moving his mouth?
[09:06.92]Wait, what?
[09:10.10]Are we talking telepathy?
[09:13.43]Telepathy.
[09:14.53]We're reading each other's minds.
[09:17.83]Thank you.
[09:33.51]Actually kind of cool.
[09:36.87]No unnecessary mouth movements.
[09:39.49]Or facial expressions.
[09:40.41]It's better this way.
[09:41.25]I can read and watch.
[09:42.29]It's like a living comic book.
[09:45.23]That's cool.
[10:00.59]Well, this is like the first time I've ever worked with you.
[10:03.48]Ha, Tottogi.
[10:08.58]Thank you very much.
[10:13.80]Heh, but I can't help it if you end up being a fool.
[10:17.58]I haven't paid any attention.
[10:18.60]I'm so sorry.
[10:19.12]I've been reading chat.
[10:20.74]Somebody give me like a two sentence like what the beginning of Yakuza 0 is.
[10:24.53]Well,
[10:28.98]I'm not disinterested yet.
[10:30.04]I'm okay.
[10:30.78]They're committing crimes.
[10:35.29]Okay.
[10:35.73]Two sentences.
[10:36.37]Stop talking and read the title.
[10:37.47]What?
[10:58.92]I got the whole story now.
[11:01.72]I got the whole story.
[11:25.25]I told you the beginning of this game is fairly slow, I've heard, but it ramps up big time real soon.
[11:31.03]Trust me.
[11:33.17]I was told by a very reliable source that this game really ramps up after the first 40 minutes.
[11:38.68]Give it a second.
[11:39.30]We've got plenty of time.
[11:40.36]It's a Thursday night.
[11:42.06]Go get a drink.
[11:43.40]Go get a sandwich.
[11:52.23]It's Thursday.
[11:53.97]What are you talking about?
[11:54.91]Alright.
[12:21.78]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Yakuza 0.
[12:25.72]Alright, we got another cutscene.
[12:26.84]This one's a little more lewd than the last one was.
[12:30.58]Takaya Kuroda.
[12:35.94]These are the characters.
[12:39.97]No, this is just the opening credits.
[12:41.93]We're skipping the opening credits because, like, I don't... I don't care.
[12:45.19]Like, whatever.
[12:46.75]Hopefully that wasn't anything important.
[12:47.99]That was literally the opening cutscene.
[12:49.77]That was the opening intro to a TV show.
[12:52.08]Who even watches those?
[12:53.40]Unless it's Game of Thrones.
[12:55.18]You don't watch the opening intro every time.
[12:58.62]You skip it.
[13:02.72]Do you watch, like, the home improvement intro every time?
[13:05.34]No, why would you do that?
[13:13.86]Alright, I got mine.
[13:14.76]That's 724106.
[13:15.44]Remember that.
[13:16.12]It's an important codec number.
[13:24.83]May as well have a look around and see if I can find him again.
[13:27.05]Let's go meet this guy.
[13:28.41]Find Nishikiyami.
[13:31.17]I think I said that name very wrong.
[13:33.75]It's okay.
[13:34.13]You're just Moses people.
[13:35.15]It's fine.
[13:39.41]Yakuza Moses.
[13:41.34]First joke of the evening.
[13:42.12]That was a fucking 7 out of 10.
[13:43.64]Get this man.
[13:44.32]Hey, thank you.
[13:44.98]Apples are good.
[13:46.40]The newest late shift update looks pretty good.
[13:52.07]Late shift.
[14:11.95]Alright, so this is where I learn, I guess, how to beat people up.
[14:14.95]Roch, ready?
[14:18.89]What do you want?
[14:20.21]This ain't a show.
[14:21.59]Hey, why don't you learn how to press square, square, square, square?
[14:24.11]Uh-oh, holy shit, guys, that means... That means we're the tutorial enemies.
[14:31.13]He's gonna learn how to press triangle XXX on us. ...
[14:44.45]Uh-oh, don't you lecture us.
[14:49.77]Here we go.
[14:50.93]Street hooligans.
[14:56.02]Press square repeatedly to perform a rush combo.
[15:01.36]Yeah, the fucking tutorial XXXX enemies.
[15:09.47]I'm sure I'll learn more of these as time goes on.
[15:14.86]Okay, knockdown with a finishing blow.
[15:17.19]Uh, press triangle during a circle as I... Fucking Jesus, man.
[15:21.67]Press triangle during a square combo attack to perform a finishing blow.
[15:24.15]Yeah, yeah, it's just like... I feel ya, okay.
[15:31.57]The health gauge.
[15:33.51]The yellow gauge on the top left indicates your health.
[15:36.57]The game will end if the yellow part is fully depleted.
[15:39.24]So keep an eye on your health at all times.
[15:41.24]That's not yellow, that's orange.
[15:42.90]If the gauge flashes red, it means you're in very bad shape and should replenish your health immediately.
[15:47.11]Use a recovery item.
[15:48.53]Eat something at an eatery.
[15:51.56]Okay.
[15:52.18]First, circle near an enemy to grab them.
[15:54.52]If an enemy is guarding to block your attacks, grab them and then attack to deal damage.
[15:57.86]Okay.
[16:00.64]So, uh, circle to grab.
[16:04.42]Beat the shit out of his mouth.
[16:06.70]That works.
[16:08.24]You can do like a heavy punch.
[16:11.42]Cool.
[16:15.27]Okay, that would kill someone.
[16:16.99]That would absolutely kill somebody.
[16:19.17]The training's not complete, time to wipe the smirks off your opponent's faces.
[16:22.05]If you get hit, you can strike back right away using anything.
[16:25.55]This is called a resolute counter.
[16:27.99]You can gain money by knocking down or defeating enemies depending on how you do it.
[16:31.25]You might get a bonus too, so try a range of different moves.
[16:36.11]Okay, I'll try a range of different moves.
[16:37.85]How about just grab guy by shirt and punch in face till they die?
[16:41.95]Alright, that guy got punched so hard his fucking head smashed against the wall.
[16:45.90]That was awesome.
[16:52.85]No, he got out.
[16:53.77]Fuck, I didn't get that.
[16:55.43]Damn it.
[16:56.57]Okay.
[17:02.95]He's done?
[17:03.35]Their health is in the lower right, it seems.
[17:08.09]That's cool.
[17:10.22]So is this like a beat-em-up?
[17:13.19]This feels very much like a beat-em-up.
[17:14.33]I wonder if it is.
[17:15.71]I know nothing about this series, by the way.
[17:19.60]One last punch.
[17:20.30]Get a fucking close-up of this.
[17:21.56]Hey, this is your friend over here?
[17:24.08]Watch me kill your fucking friend.
[17:27.12]And then I'm gonna kill you.
[17:31.63]I got $195,000 for that?
[17:32.29]Nice.
[17:32.45]You can do insane combos?
[17:36.95]That's, yeah, I can't wait.
[17:41.98]As usual, you don't have any mercy.
[17:45.90]Nishiki.
[17:46.62]I thought you'd been waiting for a long time.
[17:52.48]So this is like the first Akira Nishikiyama of the... I didn't read it.
[17:57.35]It's the other way around.
[17:59.19]You've been wasting your time like this because you don't have much time.
[18:01.55]You're fighting to waste your time.
[18:03.87]You can go to the health center quietly.
[18:06.27]You're a kid, aren't you?
[18:10.03]You make me laugh, that's why I'm gonna kill you last.
[18:13.90]Wait, was that one of the guys that beat up?
[18:17.00]Oh no, that was the guy saved.
[18:20.16]Huh?
[18:39.19]Oh, shit.
[18:39.65]Watch what you say here, man.
[18:40.53]You don't want to turn into a tutorial enemy.
[18:43.19]What did he say?
[18:45.33]I think he said something about press triangle three times.
[18:48.65]Nah, he didn't.
[18:49.35]He's not a tutorial enemy.
[18:50.45]It's okay.
[18:50.87]He doesn't have any info on how to press square.
[18:52.97]The other guys did.
[19:03.34]Cool.
[19:04.99]How does the stream look?
[19:06.63]I made some... I dropped this preset again.
[19:09.63]Because I'm streaming from a PS4.
[19:12.25]So hopefully it looks clean and crisp.
[19:15.23]I wonder how crispy it looks right now.
[19:16.77]Does it look really crispy on Source?
[19:18.39]Looks like shit.
[19:31.87]It's about as crisp as onions.
[19:39.24]So I guess if I stream from console, I can drop the preset again.
[19:42.90]I can't do this if I stream a regular game though, because this is on the slow preset for X.264.
[19:56.47]So I gotta buy new clothes?
[19:58.67]Is this game open world?
[20:00.83]I think it is, right?
[20:02.93]Eventually, right?
[20:03.59]This guy wants me to get a $500,000 suit.
[20:18.43]I could do 1080, 60.
[20:18.75]Yeah, I might.
[20:23.25]The thing with 1080, though, well, like, while I talk over this cutscene, it's okay.
[20:27.35]There's text.
[20:27.81]You can read it if you want.
[20:30.63]1080, 60 is very hard for people to actually watch.
[20:34.93]That cigarette is not in his mouth.
[20:37.55]That cigarette was in, like, the top part of his nose.
[20:41.25]He was smoking the cigarette.
[20:42.05]He's smoking the cigarette out of his nose.
[20:43.23]He's talking.
[20:43.89]What?
[20:44.17]What?
[20:45.65]What was that?
[20:48.79]Uh, 1080 60 is nearly impossible for, like, half of Twitch's, uh, demographics to even watch.
[20:58.38]I'm not even sure I could do 1080 60.
[21:00.02]Like, I could watch it.
[21:04.70]Nah, this is 60 FPS 720.
[21:06.84]I don't know if I'd ever want to do 1080.
[21:08.60]Like, this is pushing it.
[21:09.62]720 60.
[21:14.88]I'm gonna go drinking.
[21:15.96]I'm gonna go to Pink Street.
[21:37.79]People can still choose to watch at 720.
[21:40.35]Can they?
[21:41.45]I thought you could drop the bitrate on your end, but you couldn't drop the resolution.
[21:45.63]Oh, okay, we get to play.
[21:47.55]I don't think I was supposed to do that.
[21:50.23]I don't think I was supposed to practice my shoulder tackle.
[21:52.29]Well, get out of the fuck... Why are these people all swarming me?
[21:54.49]Get away from me!
[21:56.96]This is just a... This is an extended cutscene.
[21:59.06]I have to hold right trigger.
[22:06.38]I hate these.
[22:08.16]Why can't I control the guy that I'm supposed to be following and just run?
[22:12.72]Looks pretty cool though.
[22:14.36]The game looks nice.
[22:15.26]Smoking is bad for you!
[22:18.10]Sorry, what were you saying?
[22:37.43]I just want to show off the city.
[22:38.49]Stream at 1.44?
[22:38.93]No.
[22:39.05]You can make it at 1.44 if you really wanted to.
[22:43.35]You're talking comedy?
[22:44.43]Yeah.
[22:44.75]It was some pretty decent comedy there.
[22:46.05]Yeah.
[23:03.68]Alright, where is this place?
[23:04.84]Come on, let's go.
[23:05.60]Like, run.
[23:07.94]I want to try to make you run by me running.
[23:10.04]Will he follow me?
[23:11.79]Okay, he will.
[23:12.51]Are we supposed to go down here?
[23:14.97]I'm making him go faster by running forward.
[23:18.89]And there's no punching.
[23:19.73]I can't randomly punch.
[23:23.82]There's no random punching.
[23:29.36]Where did he go?
[23:29.92]Okay, we're done.
[23:30.66]We did it.
[23:34.99]He's following you, following him.
[23:36.69]Okay, well now we got rid of all voice.
[23:44.51]Now there's a fight going on.
[23:46.41]Two drunk businessmen.
[23:52.27]That's your problem, bro.
[23:54.45]You got a problem with important business.
[23:58.67]Hey, old man, quit talking to those them.
[24:00.53]We're not done here.
[24:01.49]Who's the old man, you snot-nosed little shit?
[24:05.19]Who's the snot?
[24:06.03]Whatever you said.
[24:06.93]Ow!
[24:09.61]Oh, now you've done it.
[24:15.60]Yeah?
[24:16.22]Come on, Grandpa, take your best shot.
[24:17.96]I will.
[24:21.70]Screw it.
[24:22.10]They're completely wasted.
[24:23.58]It's not worth the trouble.
[24:24.40]Let's take a different road.
[24:25.84]No need.
[24:26.26]I've got a faster way to fix this.
[24:27.82]Oh, yeah.
[24:28.84]I just need to sober them up a bit with my fists.
[24:33.91]What?
[24:37.13]Hold on.
[24:37.49]Wait.
[24:38.33]Is this a cutscene or do I have to do this?
[24:43.21]Am I going to get a prompt to punch these guys in the face?
[24:45.51]What?
[24:47.18]What?
[24:48.98]What are you blabbing about?
[24:50.48]Stay out of this!
[24:52.02]Yeah, butt out, you butthead!
[24:53.60]Oh no, you're both fucked!
[24:56.74]I love how this is like a real... Oh, by the way... Oh, come on, that was a joke right there.
[25:02.90]The three blue glowing bars on the top left are called the heat gauge.
[25:07.04]The heat gauge starts at first bar, and as your attacks at enemies, the gauge fills up, shifting to the second and third bar.
[25:12.29]At each level, your speed increases.
[25:13.59]Some moves require a certain level of heat, so you build up like an EX meter, essentially, right?
[25:17.77]Okay.
[25:18.15]Once the heat gauge gets to second or third bar, Kiyu's body begins to glow with a blue aura.
[25:22.19]This is called heat mode, and it singles that you can use a special heat action.
[25:25.11]Right.
[25:27.17]Come here, you motherfucker!
[25:29.51]Oh, goddammit. ...
[25:36.98]So I get to do a... Damn it!
[25:40.36]Can I put him in the trash can?
[25:41.30]Can I press, then... Okay, so... Be more loud, please?
[25:52.36]Well, that was very important to be, like, that loud.
[26:00.35]Holy shit, that was awesome.
[26:03.46]The training is now complete.
[26:04.26]That completes the blah blah blah heat gauge and special moves for the two drunkards who need some sobriety beat into them.
[26:10.10]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26:11.00]Alright, well, you take a fighting stance with R1.
[26:12.92]Okay.
[26:17.32]Okay, you hold R1 and you can just kind of... That's cool.
[26:23.53]And L locks onto an enemy.
[26:29.89]Uh, what?
[26:41.84]R1 and L to lock on.
[26:43.06]I mean, I'm locking on to this guy.
[26:56.76]This lady's clapping.
[26:59.38]Why are you clapping at this?
[27:02.79]I think you wouldn't want to be a clapping person here.
[27:13.72]I'll let go of that one.
[27:14.74]Okay.
[27:15.62]I get it.
[27:21.42]Why am I getting clappers right now?
[27:30.41]Did I... What?
[27:30.87]I beat them up so much that they now aren't drunk anymore?
[27:38.55]I remember watching music videos at that bar, then we got to talking about which idols we liked.
[27:43.15]And then some smartass started making fun of poor, sweet Shoko-chan, and then... Oh, my head's throbbing.
[27:47.48]I can't remember past that.
[27:50.32]Okay.
[27:53.52]You okay, mister?
[27:54.26]I'll walk you to the train.
[27:55.72]Oh, thank you.
[27:57.06]Thank you, son.
[27:59.82]That's not how alcohol works.
[28:01.32]Well, that would be how alcohol works if they lost, like, all their blood.
[28:07.39]Let's go drink.
[28:11.99]Completing certain challenges will earn you CP completion points.
[28:14.32]You can view them from the pause menu.
[28:16.44]Under completion, list some of the things that will probably happen on their own as you play the game, but others require more deliberate effort.
[28:21.48]Visit temples or shrines to access the CP exchange menu.
[28:25.28]You can spend CP to earn special blessings, ranging from being able to sprint for longer distances to earning more cash from fights.
[28:31.00]They're a big help, so take a look.
[28:33.81]Okay.
[28:34.61]I believe that's what that is.
[28:37.77]We walked four feet and got another cutscene.
[28:44.75]Shit, it's Revolver Ocelot.
[28:52.48]Okay.
[28:54.86]Just helped you guys work out some alcohol.
[28:56.50]Yeah, that's the point.
[28:58.06]That's the problem.
[28:59.02]You want to talk alcohol, you're taking one swig from a vintage bottle and tossing the rest.
[29:03.77]Going from the look of you, you're a Japanese Mafia, yeah?
[29:06.93]Something like that.
[29:07.53]I thought you're not supposed to talk about it if you're in the Mafia.
[29:10.13]Seems like you're pretty confident in a fight of real dynamite, boy.
[29:12.60]That's an odd compliment.
[29:15.70]Calling me a boy.
[29:16.42]Haha, don't get me ruffled now, kid.
[29:19.52]Compared to me, you're practically a toddler.
[29:21.10]Why am I doing this?
[29:21.92]I should be doing this in different voices, right?
[29:24.40]What's the holdup, man?
[29:27.64]This guy's a drunk.
[29:28.43]Fuck him.
[29:28.81]Too much booze is bad for you, Grandpa.
[29:30.75]Get out of my life.
[29:33.27]Hold up.
[29:33.65]Wait.
[29:34.19]I got one piece of advice for you.
[29:36.40]And I've got a friend waiting for me.
[29:37.80]If you've got something to say, make it quick.
[29:40.04]Ho ho ho.
[29:40.84]Out for a night with your main dog.
[29:42.54]Me and the boys used to really wreck it back when I was your age.
[29:45.61]This is like what an android would be programmed to say.
[29:49.33]With like a marketing team behind him.
[29:50.85]Like Sprint's marketing team made this up.
[29:55.25]But if you spend all your money playing around, you'll never get stronger.
[29:58.46]You've got to invest yourself.
[30:00.54]Like a gym membership.
[30:01.88]No.
[30:02.52]That's no better than spending it on booze.
[30:03.72]I'm talking about investing in yourself literally.
[30:07.27]What's that even mean?
[30:08.31]Glad you asked, my boy.
[30:10.17]Here's a special lecture just for you.
[30:13.91]Abilities are now available.
[30:16.83]Oh, damn.
[30:19.63]Boost health.
[30:20.81]I didn't know there was like a skill tree in this game.
[30:27.35]Throw your entire body behind a vicious kick.
[30:30.11]Triangle when running.
[30:32.31]Mighty knee.
[30:34.87]Health boost, health boost.
[30:39.26]Power surge.
[30:39.96]White tiger spirit.
[30:42.68]I mean, I guess... Might as well just get the kick, right?
[30:46.35]Can I even afford anything?
[30:49.23]I guess I can't.
[30:49.85]400,000.
[30:49.87]30,000.
[30:49.89]400,000.
[30:49.91]I can just almost afford this.
[30:51.09]But I guess we're going to do this.
[30:54.07]Because it's cheap.
[30:54.53]And get it.
[30:54.83]Cool.
[31:10.65]Uh, I guess that's the one I need to do to, like, learn how to do this.
[31:14.73]And this one will be next, whenever that is.
[31:17.22]Okay, uh... Alright.
[31:27.76]Keep pouring money into yourself.
[31:34.19]Bet you're glad you stopped and listened.
[31:35.45]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo, yo, yo, I'm coming, okay.
[31:43.99]This game is really good.
[31:45.37]That's what I've heard.
[31:46.57]I've heard it just starts very slowly.
[31:48.49]But obviously we're going to start from the beginning.
[31:50.55]Alright, let's go.
[31:53.80]Obviously we're going to start this from the beginning.
[32:00.18]So he'll follow me, right?
[32:01.08]So just run up here.
[32:03.13]And he'll... Yeah, there we go.
[32:04.69]I'm not going to follow him anymore.
[32:06.19]We're going to sprint by him.
[32:15.16]Is that the drunk guy again?
[32:17.86]Or multiple drunks?
[32:19.85]This town's crazy.
[32:29.69]They come in for booze and women and they get... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:33.76]Why did you start waxing your bikini?
[32:35.98]Not that you're wrong.
[32:37.00]I mean, everyone needs to wax their bikini.
[32:39.08]You impressed?
[32:39.84]Yeah, I am.
[32:41.22]You're removing lots of unwanted hair.
[32:43.76]Oh, look, two ladies.
[32:45.02]Mm-hmm.
[32:46.80]I've been ringing your pager, but you never call me back.
[32:52.12]When are you coming back to the club?
[33:00.46]Never.
[33:01.22]Really?
[33:15.72]What happened to the typewriter voices?
[33:21.14]Yeah, they kind of just replaced them, like, randomly, huh?
[33:25.95]Pick a card, any card.
[33:29.29]Is this your card?
[33:31.63]Yes, it was!
[33:32.27]Good.
[33:33.51]Hey, Gummy Monk, thanks for the five dollars.
[33:41.79]I'm getting the impression that this game is not for you.
[33:43.83]Well, I don't even know yet.
[33:45.13]We haven't been able to play it.
[33:47.54]I mean, it's gonna take, uh... It's gonna take, like, an hour or two for me to figure that out.
[33:52.98]Once we get into the game, then we'll find that out.
[33:54.82]It's gonna take us a little while, though.
[34:10.92]Those guys look like Yakuza to me.
[34:14.04]I hear like a bunch of loud static.
[34:17.66]That's why, when I drink with my brothers, I take a lot of girls with me.
[34:23.68]That's how they pay me.
[34:25.56]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:26.56]Once the cutscenes are over, that's when the game really opens up.
[34:28.85]I can imagine.
[34:29.57]I'm ready.
[34:30.17]No.
[34:30.33]That might be it.
[34:38.33]There's also on- what is the online in this game?
[34:40.61]Alright, good.
[34:48.24]Now we get to play the game.
[34:50.96]No we don't.
[34:57.32]This is a fucking empty bar, this is depressing.
[34:59.54]Hey, you wanna come with me and just drink alone in this bar together?
[35:03.70]In this weird house bar?
[35:07.01]No cutscenes?
[35:07.95]Just pretend it's a late shift?
[35:09.45]No.
[35:09.57]Just bear with me.
[35:10.43]Trust me.
[35:12.96]The game will get good.
[35:16.48]Just wait.
[35:16.92]We have to get past the drinking cutscenes.
[35:38.04]I hate fruit, thanks for the seven dolls.
[35:39.88]I don't mean to beat a dead horse here.
[35:43.26]You wrote something else.
[35:45.05]I'm not going to read that.
[35:47.21]But I can't get over how the main character looks like me if I was Asian.
[35:52.93]The main character is a pretty handsome guy, so I mean, I'll take it.
[35:58.60]It'll get good just like Horizon did.
[36:01.98]Wait.
[36:05.34]Yeah, but Horizon, like, sucks.
[36:07.06]No, wait, I can't say that.
[36:08.40]I can't say that.
[36:08.94]Do people like that?
[36:09.98]Wait, do people like that game?
[36:17.26]Did people like that game, right?
[36:21.33]Alright, we're gonna do karaoke.
[36:30.31]No, we're gonna play chess.
[36:32.15]Karaoke is a rhythm game where you press buttons shown on the screen in time with a song.
[36:35.49]Simply press the indicated button when the cursor reaches it.
[36:37.49]What?
[36:39.13]Press the correct buttons at the right time.
[36:40.45]The better your timing, the more points you get.
[36:43.17]We're gonna wait.
[36:43.55]We're gonna sing?
[36:44.16]Are we gonna sit here and sing to each other?
[36:47.20]When someone else sings, you can support them with interjections.
[36:51.34]You can choose either simple or lively interjections.
[36:53.94]Simple interjections offer easier inputs, but you won't get more than 90 points.
[36:59.67]What?
[37:00.67]Tambourine?
[37:03.23]What the fuck is this game?
[37:04.49]Okay, click.
[37:08.05]Sing along, tambourine.
[37:09.41]Uh, which one are we gonna do?
[37:17.98]Oh, we're gonna do this one.
[37:23.23]Okay, you guys ready to play Yakuza?
[37:32.86]We're doing a slow jam, and I have one audience member.
[37:36.61]It's my friend and the bartender.
[37:40.49]Oh my god When do I get to fucking fight people?
[38:00.83]Does this game even have, like, fighting?
[38:02.54]Do you drive cars in this game, or do you just sing?
[38:05.32]Is this a character?
[38:06.00]Wait, there's two more people there.
[38:08.98]I love you.
[38:11.06]I love you.
[38:12.20]I love you.
[38:15.68]I love you.
[38:32.53]Look at how fast I can press this!
[38:34.83]Shit.
[38:36.97]I don't even have a microphone anymore.
[38:41.19]This turned into a music video.
[38:48.26]Lookit, this is a music video, it's not karaoke anymore.
[39:02.59]See the one for the fast song?
[39:05.90]Alright, let's do the fast song.
[39:09.36]You do AFK for five minutes and you come back to this.
[39:18.93]He's just crying at a bar, what happened?
[39:22.85]What happened there?
[39:24.48]Did I make any money?
[39:30.37]Score is... 90.
[39:33.93]Great, good, bad mistake.
[39:35.49]90 points.
[39:37.41]Alright.
[39:39.17]I got a 90+.
[39:40.13]Entertain yourself 10 times.
[39:44.05]Should I do the other one?
[39:45.61]No.
[39:47.21]I'm not doing the other one.
[39:50.14]We're gonna move on.
[39:54.16]That was so good.
[39:56.60]Thanks, man.
[39:58.10]I appreciate that.
[40:00.68]No, I'm not doing the other one.
[40:01.88]Like, you want me to lose more viewers?
[40:03.58]Like, I'll do the other one.
[40:04.70]Like, and lose like 500 more people.
[40:07.19]Oh my god, fine, I'll do the other ones.
[40:11.25]I guess the people that stuck around for this deserve me to deserve the other one, right?
[40:18.24]Stop skipping the dialogue.
[40:19.42]I'm sorry!
[40:21.94]Game viewers.
[40:24.30]That's half the game.
[40:29.97]Okay, let's entertain ourselves again.
[40:33.45]No, I don't think we can.
[40:34.51]Okay, we're gone.
[40:37.49]I can't go back in, but I want to sing.
[40:39.55]Alright, where are we going?
[40:42.50]We're obviously going this way.
[40:46.38]Come on.
[40:48.02]I ain't waiting around for you.
[40:49.34]We're skipping this.
[40:51.76]You are jogging over here and we're going to finish this dumb walk escort mission.
[40:56.54]Come on.
[40:58.79]Hey, don't be in such a hurry.
[41:00.25]Huh?
[41:00.33]What is it?
[41:00.73]You're not eating at all.
[41:24.26]Did we, like, live together?
[41:25.14]What's happening right now?
[41:28.38]This is a story game?
[41:30.42]We're not skipping this game.
[41:31.49]Why would you tell me to skip?
[41:32.97]We just got to a part that was, like, cool.
[41:34.63]They smoke a lot of cigarettes.
[41:36.21]They shouldn't be smoking that much cigarettes, is it?
[41:48.48]cutscene in the game.
[41:49.97]Look, for those of you that are just joining us, I was told that this is gonna take like an hour, and then we get to do fun shit.
[41:58.87]That guy's the same, pretty much the same age as me.
[42:00.75]No, he's the age, that's right.
[42:02.15]I love that this person wrote, skip the cutscenes, I wanna see murder.
[42:12.47]I just calmed down a little.
[42:14.43]I calmed down a little bit here.
[42:15.97]It's not all about murder.
[42:17.35]It's about like watching the cutscenes and getting to know the characters.
[42:23.17]I calmed down, man.
[42:29.63]It's not just about fucking murdering people like GTA style.
[42:34.63]I want to see what's happening.
[42:38.10]Is that the drunk guy?
[42:38.80]Restart the game and do the other song from karaoke.
[42:41.48]Hey, Captain Magic, thanks for the bits.
[42:45.17]I'm not gonna restart the game.
[42:58.99]I get the impression that it's a pretty distorted space, but Kurihara-san's body is... I bet Jericho watches porn for the story.
[43:02.17]I bet Jerma watches porn for the story.
[43:06.78]Why are you talking about porn?
[43:07.96]We're not talking about pornography on my livestream guys.
[43:15.21]Absolutely not.
[43:24.23]Thanks for the $5, Crip World.
[43:26.91]You ever play Shenmue?
[43:28.71]Game series is considered the spiritual successor to it.
[43:31.53]There's a lot to do, including karaoke, bowling, managing businesses, not to mention wacky side stories with NPCs.
[43:38.06]I did play Shenmue.
[43:39.64]I loved Shenmue.
[43:41.24]On the green cash system.
[43:50.38]How about transitioned out of that to the... Alright, here we go.
[43:54.40]This is where you get your first mission.
[43:57.19]Yeah.
[44:00.27]I can determine when we're not in the tutorial anymore when I get to punch my first pedestrian in the face.
[44:07.38]That's how I figure if I'm still in the tutorial or not, right?
[44:11.66]Walk outside and haymaker a pedestrian.
[44:14.34]That's how you know in an open world game that you're ready to play. ...
[44:25.75]the inferior American version next mission perfect karaoke
[44:36.63]This guy's been on a power trip the whole time.
[44:39.29]Either way, I've got no choice but to call them back, right?
[44:41.43]I gotta call her back.
[45:06.78]I guess not.
[45:08.96]Alright, you go.
[45:09.48]Let's see if I can get some device.
[45:12.24]Thanks.
[45:13.80]Alright, here we go.
[45:15.34]Time to play Yakuza 0.
[45:16.48]It only took us 45 minutes.
[45:21.44]Can I spell eye cup?
[45:23.46]I sure can.
[45:25.62]I piss all the time.
[45:26.98]I pee every day in the toilet.
[45:29.76]There you go.
[45:30.22]Is that what you wanted?
[45:34.14]I've got to call the Dojima family HQ.
[45:36.02]There should be a pay phone around here.
[45:37.91]Here we go, guys.
[45:39.65]Uh, guy on his fucking cell phone over there.
[45:41.91]First pedestrian.
[45:51.97]Game sucks.
[45:53.71]Alright, let's go.
[45:58.09]Check.
[45:59.65]Better call the family office.
[46:00.75]We haven't got to go to the pay phone now.
[46:11.29]It's a guy that I just bumped into.
[46:13.61]Does he find me?
[46:17.90]Oh, God.
[46:18.86]Coming down to the office right away.
[46:24.29]There's three lieutenants waiting for me.
[46:27.23]Got it.
[46:27.45]I'm gonna start to paraphrase.
[46:28.49]Here's what I'm gonna do.
[46:29.67]I'm gonna start to paraphrase these whole conversations for you guys.
[46:34.44]So, instead of a sentence, I'm gonna say, like, one.
[46:37.52]Like, one word.
[46:39.84]Take a taxi.
[46:41.54]Go to the Dojima family HQ.
[46:42.78]No, you don't take a taxi.
[46:44.18]Get on a bike.
[46:45.54]Take something.
[46:46.12]Steal something.
[46:48.14]Commit some kind of crime.
[46:49.18]I have to walk there?
[46:55.61]Why would I walk there?
[46:56.65]I can't just, like, steal a car?
[46:57.93]Ugh.
[47:03.59]Where's their taxi?
[47:08.32]They ran into an invisible wall.
[47:10.76]I have to take a taxi.
[47:13.98]Okay.
[47:17.42]Wait, what?
[47:20.46]What's going on?
[47:22.10]Hooligans?
[47:22.70]Am I the hooligan?
[47:24.84]I think I'm the hooligan here.
[47:31.48]I'm pretty sure I'm the bad guy in this situation.
[47:33.72]They just saw me, like, knock a guy on the ground.
[47:35.72]Oh, that was a double nice.
[47:42.87]Is that it?
[47:45.69]That's it.
[47:46.17]Nope, this guy's gonna get up and he's done.
[47:51.05]Hey, how dare you, like, push that couple on the ground?
[47:56.34]Who's the guy that used to grab people's faces and their head, like, brains would explode?
[48:01.01]Uh, Fullmetal Alchemist, Scar, right?
[48:06.68]Alright, I just beat these guys all up to get like, they all have stomach aches, good.
[48:14.59]Alright, where's the taxi?
[48:16.97]Taxi?
[48:20.33]Taxi!
[48:21.11]Do I have to like call a taxi or what?
[48:22.99]Do I have to find a taxi?
[48:31.47]Have I already gotten fucking lost?
[48:33.33]There's only two places to go.
[48:38.41]That's not a taxi.
[48:39.21]It's like a green car.
[48:43.05]I need to grab a cab.
[48:49.92]Where's a taxi?
[48:54.10]These are the same guys I just beat up.
[48:56.04]They want to do it again?
[48:59.12]I just kicked the shit out of these guys.
[49:02.17]They were just crying, and now they got back up.
[49:04.15]Oh, no, actually, let's fight him again.
[49:06.35]That went so well last time.
[49:13.54]Like, really?
[49:18.70]Oh, by the way, make sure you don't carry a million dollars on you, Jacob.
[49:22.84]I have three million.
[49:28.59]Can I stomp these guys on the ground?
[49:31.47]No.
[49:35.29]Looks like we're just going down here.
[49:41.88]What?
[49:43.96]Holy shit, there's actual... there's realism in this game.
[49:52.96]I was trying to bump into this person and have them go like... And you guys would... I would have saw... so many people would have laughed in the chat too.
[49:59.47]Alright, where's the taxi?
[50:03.89]Why am I walking so slowly?
[50:07.10]I can't even run in the street and get hit by a fucking car?
[50:09.46]Come on!
[50:11.26]What kind of game is this where I can't get hurt?
[50:13.68]I can't like go walk in the fucking street and get hit by a bus.
[50:17.58]What is this?
[50:19.24]Wow.
[50:20.92]No, what?
[50:25.30]Okay, fine.
[50:28.78]You're telling me I can't just get plowed?
[50:33.24]Whatever.
[50:36.12]Maybe it's not GTA.
[50:39.21]I know, I just compare everything to GTA, because GTA is like the greatest fucking video game series ever.
[50:48.91]Sorry.
[50:50.53]I'm so sorry.
[50:51.29]I'm sorry.
[50:51.85]That was annoying.
[50:52.57]Alright.
[50:59.88]Here we go.
[51:00.32]We're at the Dejima family.
[51:05.43]Not a sandbox game, bro.
[51:08.40]That's alright.
[51:11.14]I've heard that this game is very fun once you get into it.
[51:14.32]And we're going to get into it.
[51:16.94]The night is young, guys.
[51:17.96]It's only 7.45.
[51:19.32]The night is young.
[51:22.87]The guy with the purple jacket is definitely the bad guy here.
[51:26.65]Yep.
[51:29.47]Definitely fucking Asian Elvis is definitely the bad guy in this situation.
[51:32.71]I guarantee it.
[51:36.16]But hold up, wait, which one of these is Elvis?
[51:39.16]There's like two Asian Elvises.
[51:45.36]What happened?
[51:46.52]Lieutenant of the Tajima family, Patriarch of the... I couldn't even read that.
[51:49.14]I'm sorry, Kuzeno-aniki.
[51:50.52]I don't know why I called you here.
[51:53.94]Do you understand?
[52:04.65]Okay, these are all like the families.
[52:07.77]I gotta be careful here.
[52:17.06]So much for getting in some golf today.
[52:21.03]Alright, let's read this name quick.
[52:22.15]Lieutenant of the Tajima Family Patriarch of the Taihei Association.
[52:26.70]I got a call from Kanekashi, who asked you to take the money.
[52:32.72]Kanekashi?
[52:33.10]It's the president of Togo Bridget.
[52:34.34]That guy.
[52:34.58]You're the one who killed Katakibu, right?
[52:36.66]Yeah, I whacked that guy.
[52:38.14]But he said it wasn't his fault, so he ran away right away.
[52:44.14]It's only about 300,000 yen worth of money.
[52:57.56]300 bucks?
[53:02.56]Shit.
[53:03.34]So do I pick, like, a loyalty here?
[53:04.82]It's definitely gonna be twitch.tv Asian Elvis.
[53:09.73]You guys know that that's the guy I'm choosing.
[53:12.07]Wait a minute.
[53:12.69]I'm... Don't worry about it.
[53:15.65]Even if you cut him off, he's still a piece of shit.
[53:33.16]How did you get a full Jupiter?
[53:37.10]What the fuck?
[53:40.89]Everybody just calm down.
[53:42.79]Everyone relax.
[53:43.63]This is not a next situation.
[53:45.45]This guy's the most intimidating to me.
[53:55.36]I don't like this guy.
[54:01.55]Watch it be like you fight three guys in a room.
[54:03.83]It's just these three guys.
[54:08.32]So I accidentally killed somebody I wasn't supposed to kill.
[54:10.54]Don't be a dumb shit.
[54:11.64]Hmm.
[54:25.30]That guy hasn't said anything.
[54:31.59]That probably hurt his shin.
[54:33.47]And right now he's pretending it didn't hurt, but it did.
[54:35.33]You can tell he has a burning fucking pain in his shin.
[54:38.53]He's just like, fuck, I'm like a super, super important Yakuza mob boss.
[54:43.04]If I show that that hurt, I'm gonna be licking to think I'm a little wuss.
[54:46.44]Oh, it hurts so much.
[54:47.74]Why did you choose that place?
[54:54.21]Yeah.
[54:57.77]How many times have you guys done that?
[55:00.58]You've, like, really hurt your shin or, like, your arm or your toe or something, really stubbed your toe, and someone's like, you alright?
[55:04.62]And you're like, yeah, I'm good.
[55:05.94]And inside, like, inside your brain, you're like, fucking, this is the most intense pain I've ever had.
[55:10.32]If they know this, then it's gonna justify them saying, are you okay?
[55:14.80]And I'm gonna have to tell them I'm not okay.
[55:17.02]I've done that all the fucking time.
[55:24.18]Do I have notifications off?
[55:27.64]I shouldn't.
[55:29.12]They're not showing up on stream.
[55:30.88]I can't hear the notifications.
[55:32.38]They should still pop up on stream.
[55:33.64]I just can't hear them because I don't have them plugged into my head.
[55:36.41]Because I'm playing on the console right now.
[55:39.09]Unfortunately.
[55:39.65]Yes.
[55:47.34]Should you make popcorn or dinner?
[55:49.27]Make dinner.
[55:51.43]Oh, Kiryu.
[56:05.95]Maybe it's something to do with the beach treatment from the council.
[56:08.15]I'm not sure why it's not coming up.
[56:09.65]Oh, let's see here.
[56:10.95]It should be popping up.
[56:14.88]Should be, at least.
[56:15.74]Hmm, let's see.
[56:17.08]Has nothing popped up on the screen, the entire screen?
[56:18.80]Looks like it's connected.
[56:35.86]I'm not sure why.
[56:38.22]Oh my god, just play the goddamn game.
[56:40.88]That's what I'm doing.
[56:42.99]This is the game.
[56:44.31]At least for now.
[56:52.93]At least for now.
[56:54.95]Just go grab a katana.
[57:01.95]I'm sure they're in the game.
[57:05.21]Alright, that's it.
[57:05.63]Let's go.
[57:06.41]Cool.
[57:07.73]He's going to look at me sternly.
[57:08.67]He's going to wave to his henchman.
[57:10.07]He's going to say, yeah, just, well, don't pick up the snake on the table.
[57:13.99]There's a coiled up snake there.
[57:15.16]I was going to make sure you guys know that that's there.
[57:18.14]Don't fucking touch me.
[57:21.68]I'm like just filling in the blanks right now, guys.
[57:23.64]I'm sorry.
[57:24.68]Nice fucking pin.
[57:25.64]I like that pin.
[57:29.62]I like that.
[57:29.94]I like that.
[57:30.60]You know, I like a nice suit.
[57:32.06]If you guys would, you know that.
[57:33.94]I love a nice suit with like a nice pin on it.
[57:35.84]They went from pre-rendered cutscene to back into a non-pre-rendered cutscene.
[57:58.38]I didn't even get it.
[57:59.58]That's true.
[58:00.08]Shit.
[58:27.53]God damn it.
[58:28.13]I tried.
[58:29.35]God, being slick.
[58:31.41]Yeah, pretty much.
[58:32.09]Broadcaster, are you okay?
[58:34.70]I'm okay.
[58:56.13]This guy kind of has a PR voice, by the way.
[59:02.05]He's like, yeah.
[59:04.09]Yeah.
[59:05.69]He's one of the things I agree.
[59:08.57]What would you live as a new team against one hell of a prize for a trouble, you know what I mean?
[59:15.10]You know what I'm saying?
[59:17.14]Prize?
[59:17.52]Yeah.
[59:18.90]Yeah.
[59:26.33]patience everybody have patience
[59:39.24]Play sport?
[59:39.98]I'm not fucking playing sport.
[59:41.68]I already played it.
[59:42.38]We have zero patience now.
[59:45.13]Make a joke or we're gonna riot.
[60:03.29]No, we're not.
[60:04.03]No, no, no.
[60:11.00]He did say, quotes, playing, in quotes, spore.
[60:13.50]Hey, thank you, Mitchell256, for the 20 bucks.
[60:14.64]This is like five consecutive hours of watching the Hanzo Genji short on repeat. ...
[60:32.32]I don't think these guys are brothers.
[60:35.24]I don't think these guys are... Are these guys... Is this like brothers?
[60:38.12]Maybe they are.
[60:38.50]Are they like father and son?
[60:39.42]I have no idea.
[60:39.82]Thank you, Mitchell, for the $2.56.
[60:41.66]What?
[60:41.82]No, his name is Mitchell256 and he gave $20.
[60:42.73]He didn't give $2.56.
[60:43.23]Thanks for the $2.56.
[60:43.63]Thanks for the $2.56.
[61:09.44]Alright.
[61:10.74]Now let's turn on the fucking stereo and do karaoke.
[61:19.81]Alright.
[61:20.39]Whatever the next cutscene is, I think I'm going to have to skip it.
[61:22.77]Alright.
[61:22.97]We're in an in-game cutscene.
[61:23.87]That's okay.
[61:24.13]Here we go.
[61:26.81]It's going to be like, I'm going to get a text message from fucking, what's the guy's name?
[61:31.06]Alec?
[61:32.28]Alec, the guy that wants to go bowling?
[61:33.50]What's his name?
[61:33.86]The cousin.
[61:36.94]Derek, what's his name?
[61:37.78]What's the guy's name that wants to always go bowling?
[61:40.22]Not that guy.
[61:41.28]Stop showing me that guy.
[61:43.92]Not Nico.
[61:44.76]What's the other guy's name?
[61:45.66]Roman.
[61:46.06]There it is.
[61:48.99]Hey.
[61:51.89]Not this guy again.
[61:56.52]Did I say Derek?
[61:59.12]Yeah, and the old guy from last night.
[62:01.47]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[62:04.07]And I found this guy, too.
[62:06.07]He's going to teach you how to do different moves.
[62:08.31]I teach you how to put points into your fucking body.
[62:12.37]And this guy is going to teach you how to do things.
[62:14.91]That's the correct question.
[62:22.90]Ask them.
[62:23.14]They're really angry.
[62:24.18]Really angry people.
[62:25.20]Time to fight.
[62:27.83]Alright Gramps, is this the kid?
[62:29.75]Is this the same two guys, three guys that were in the alleyway before?
[62:38.32]Interesting outfits.
[62:44.28]Okay, so they're asking for money.
[62:50.34]Obviously I'm going to kick the shit out of these guys.
[62:53.26]I'm just gonna beat them up and he's gonna teach me something new.
[62:58.61]Can you take this guy in a fight?
[62:59.65]Sure.
[62:59.77]You think he'd beat you?
[63:01.59]No, I don't know.
[63:02.43]What are you trying to say?
[63:03.13]Don't bait me into this conversation.
[63:04.51]Don't take... Don't bait the streamer into doing something stupid that he doesn't want to do.
[63:11.44]Okay.
[63:15.26]I'll pay you the money.
[63:16.56]Alright, let's go.
[63:18.68]I feel terrible.
[63:19.24]This guy just doesn't feel well.
[63:20.90]That's the same guy talking.
[63:27.94]I love how this guy says no and yes.
[63:35.65]Come on.
[63:41.63]Come on.
[63:43.57]Come on.
[63:45.02]Fight.
[63:45.54]Alright.
[63:46.24]Sure.
[63:48.85]Me and this random old guy.
[63:50.07]This guy's definitely like a master boxer.
[63:51.79]Look at him.
[63:52.29]Okay, cool.
[63:54.57]I don't even get to fight.
[63:56.41]That's not good.
[64:01.49]Nice.
[64:02.66]Alright, teach me those moves.
[64:04.94]That's rad.
[64:05.72]Is that me just daydreaming about how I wish I could do that?
[64:21.96]What?
[64:22.22]Yeah, I was just daydreaming about how cool that was.
[64:37.13]I did say this was going to be a movie in the very beginning.
[64:46.60]I tried to warn you guys.
[64:53.41]Okay, apparently, I heard the word murder parade.
[64:57.07]There we go, we get time to fight.
[64:58.95]Just grab punch in face.
[65:00.82]You can switch to rush style by pressing left on the feedback.
[65:04.66]Okay, no.
[65:06.12]One advantage of the rush style is you can evade with a series of quick steps by pressing X repeatedly.
[65:10.91]You can combo for three of them together.
[65:13.79]Just to avoid any attacks and bite them out when they're taking damage.
[65:25.02]It's just like Dark Souls.
[65:26.44]Come on, punch me.
[65:38.31]Cool.
[65:38.99]I like this mode.
[65:40.89]Use rush-style moves to crush Bruno and show him who's boss.
[65:44.37]Using rush-style, you can stun enemies by hitting them a certain number of times.
[65:48.47]Stunned enemies will knock them down without fail, so square attacks are effective against those that are hard not to drown.
[65:55.55]Yeah, that's like a dart break.
[66:06.32]Okay.
[66:21.12]I thought he was supposed to get Stunned.
[66:41.51]Is that the Stun they're talking about?
[66:42.77]Okay, there we go.
[67:00.02]use the uber uh can I do the uber usually it's it's circle right that's just like a big kick uh that's cool that's cool alright is that is that are we done with the tutorial what family are you guys from

[67:30.92]We're bankers.
[67:33.00]I gotta go meet with your boss, the president.
[67:35.52]Figured he'd be at the office at this hour.
[67:36.90]Oh, I see.
[67:37.84]That's the building on Taihei Boulevard East, right?
[67:42.15]I'll take care of the televised, okay?
[67:44.23]Yeah, fine.
[67:45.05]Deal's a deal, Bruno.
[67:45.77]Here, I'll have to cover the difference.
[67:46.77]That's how it works.
[67:47.81]Yeah, that's definitely what I'll tell you.
[67:49.87]Yeah, okay.
[67:50.41]Better get moving.
[67:50.93]Come on, Bruno.
[67:51.38]Pick it up.

[68:17.40]I'm sorry, guys.
[68:18.90]I just skipped a little bit.
[68:24.65]This guy can teach me a lot about fighting.
[68:27.03]Okay.
[68:28.37]In the parking lot.
[68:31.45]Okay, so this guy's in the parking lot.
[68:34.63]This guy hangs out and just drinks and like levels you up.
[68:38.17]And there's a guy at a bank.
[68:42.00]Okay, like I know this is gonna be fun.
[68:45.18]I can't wait.
[68:49.76]This guy wants me to box for a living and, like, he wants to make money on me.
[68:52.46]That's fine.
[68:53.39]There's a karaoke bar right there, everybody.
[69:02.73]Okay.
[69:03.78]Okay.

[69:38.24]No, I have to stop and catch my- I can run more than this guy.
[69:41.44]How sad is that?
[69:42.68]This guy's like a mastermind Yakuza assassin.
[69:46.26]He can sprint down an alley, and then he has to catch his breath.
[69:49.14]I can run, like, a mile like that.
[69:51.40]I could run a full sprint mile.
[69:55.98]This guy can't even do it around a fucking corner.
[70:01.29]Get ready first.
[70:02.07]No, go in the building.
[70:02.95]Like, what do you mean, go get ready?
[70:08.98]I want to get through this as fast as possible.
[70:11.96]I'm ready.
[70:13.74]Oh, maybe I wasn't ready.
[70:14.78]These guys all have like weapons.
[70:19.48]What are you doing here, punk?
[70:22.76]It's like the same guy.
[70:26.96]That guy's really big.
[70:40.18]Okay, no interest in speaking with me.

[70:56.41]Let's go into our dodge stance.
[70:58.71]And here we go.
[70:59.55]Back it up.
[71:16.68]Take that guy's ass.
[71:17.54]Let's grab this motherfucker and smash his head into the wall.
[71:26.40]And break his neck.
[71:28.27]Can I pick up his weapon?
[71:29.57]I hope so.
[71:31.33]Oh, yeah, I can.
[71:32.19]This guy's fucking so done.

[71:40.85]Oh!
[71:41.01]Oh!
[71:45.10]Okay, that was awesome.
[71:51.80]I'm bringing this work- oh yeah, I'm bringing this pipe up with me for sure.
[71:57.46]You guys didn't think I was ready?
[72:01.06]I dropped it, look.
[72:03.34]Pretty sick- wait, this guy's got a fucking tuna can!
[72:05.98]No, not a tuna can, a trash can!
[72:08.52]What, they were just waiting for me?
[72:10.88]Oh shit, I am not ready for this.
[72:22.39]That guy just fucking messed up so bad.
[72:24.59]I wish they could punch each other, that would be amazing.
[72:42.22]Nice.
[72:42.68]Okay, this is fun.
[72:43.66]I'm having fun.
[72:45.92]Shit.
[72:46.22]Okay, easy.
[73:02.69]Chicken of the sea.
[73:03.65]Yeah, that guy had a giant chicken of the sea.
[73:09.23]No, I was going to say air tank.
[73:11.96]That guy had a sick air tank.
[73:15.22]Scuba diving.
[73:19.08]You can do heat moves in rush style, right?
[73:21.78]Oh, he's got a gun.
[73:22.46]Do I get guns in this game?
[73:30.80]You just shoot its back.
[73:55.21]Well, I just had to walk at this guy and he didn't even care.
[73:58.21]The audio is desynced?
[74:00.15]God damn it, really?
[74:01.19]It must have gone out of sync.
[74:02.91]Yeah, I have... There's not much I can do about it at this point.
[74:09.96]Unfortunately.
[74:10.54]Because I had to... I'll tell the story in a second.
[74:20.82]Kuzeno.
[74:22.39]Aniki.
[74:26.01]Oh no, it was you.
[74:28.75]It was you.
[74:32.89]They're gonna put me in the hospital.
[74:40.73]This is not my internal guard, I had to get the Elgato out of the box.
[74:53.43]And then I wake up in the hospital.
[74:56.65]That guy in the red suit before, he's gonna be like, oh man, you got fucked up.
[75:01.67]Oh no, not another lecture.
[75:03.17]I'm gonna give my boy a lecture.
[75:05.31]That means we're in for like a 10 minute cutscene.
[75:11.41]Ah, shit.
[75:32.64]Here, these are my favorite.
[75:34.62]These are my favorite baseball cards.
[75:46.81]Buckle up, everybody.
[75:57.97]He just goes under the desk.
[76:00.17]I like it over here.
[76:03.86]No bullshit.
[76:04.62]He just wants to have a talk.
[76:05.60]Okay.
[76:07.57]You and that guy, you're orphans.
[76:09.11]You grew up in this orphanage.
[76:11.21]Huh?
[76:12.83]There's no shame in you.
[76:13.77]It's rare that you're an orphan and you're a Yakuza too.
[76:16.09]Still, that's cruel.
[76:18.07]What are you talking about?
[76:19.69]He takes these kids and he owns them for life.
[76:23.24]He's like human shields.
[76:24.80]He's fucked up.
[76:26.18]You're giving your life for this guy?
[76:27.30]What's the point here?
[76:34.15]Dude, spy on him for me.
[76:37.67]Huh?
[76:38.57]Told you about the empty lot.
[76:39.55]He's there.
[76:40.01]Go check him out.
[76:42.05]I need you to get one piece of information.
[76:43.77]He's sitting on this.
[76:46.46]Yeah, get it out of him somehow.
[76:48.76]He's never going to talk to you.
[76:53.10]25,000 people in that clan.
[76:54.26]There's a lot of people there.
[76:57.30]I'll give you a bunch of fucking money.
[76:58.88]And I'll give you the guy that murdered your friend.
[77:01.81]I'm trying to condense this stuff.
[77:04.44]Wait, do I have to make a choice?
[77:24.98]I think I have to make a decision.
[77:26.14]This thing made me say the plot all wrong.
[77:49.23]Jerma couldn't stand in line for 5 minutes?
[77:51.75]Well, we've been standing in line for an hour and 20 minutes.
[77:54.36]Come on, this is not 5 minutes of cutscenes.
[77:57.90]I've been streaming for an hour and 20 minutes.
[78:01.88]This ain't no 5 minute line at Wendy's.
[78:04.74]Come on.
[78:05.55]Give me a little bit of slack.
[78:19.72]Yeah, this is the capture card out of my closet.
[78:21.92]So this is going to be like audio issues with it, unfortunately.
[78:24.52]I'm sorry.
[78:26.92]That's my beeper.
[78:32.46]That's not a number I recognize.
[78:33.62]Who is it?
[78:34.98]That's not even like an actual number.
[78:36.74]There's no letters.
[78:38.30]X71?
[78:40.96]9348.
[78:41.00]That's like a... That's a Mega Man prototype.
[78:42.74]That's not a phone number.
[78:45.54]That's some fucking Dr. Wily shit.
[78:56.36]Look at this.
[78:58.10]Look at this.
[78:59.92]This fantastic, wonderful, wonderful gameplay we have here.
[79:03.81]Go find another payphone.
[79:09.71]Go on.
[79:12.51]Let me just play a video.
[79:14.68]Let me do a million yen vending machine.
[79:17.72]I want to do this.
[79:20.51]Insert a million dollars to make your dream come true.
[79:23.85]I'm doing it.
[79:25.30]I said my dreams are going to come true.
[79:27.36]A million dollars.
[79:35.02]It gave me one business card.
[79:38.94]What?
[79:45.71]Can I craft that into something?
[79:47.65]What did I get?
[79:48.27]There it is.
[79:55.27]Okay, well it's a- wait, it's a weapon?
[79:58.57]Why do I have that as a weapon?
[80:00.17]I'm gonna steal business cards as a weapon.
[80:06.90]Oh my god, that's so dumb.
[80:08.54]I love it.
[80:10.08]Okay.
[80:13.40]Here comes another cutscene.
[80:27.11]Well, thank you, Shan-Man, for the greetings from Australia.
[80:30.07]I hope Australia is good this time.
[80:32.45]I hope it's good weather.
[80:36.72]And I'm glad to make you laugh.
[80:39.28]If there's anything more I can do, at least I can do that.
[80:43.84]This guy's gonna give us some advice.
[80:57.19]Makes sense.
[80:58.27]This bright green, cartoon, Blue's Clues telephone.
[81:01.80]Yeah, make sure Steve finds the pencil that's hidden in plain sight on the right of the table.
[81:12.10]I'm trying here, guys, with this comment.
[81:13.53]I'm trying.
[81:16.88]I'm trying.
[81:18.16]I have a karaoke.
[81:30.79]This fight coming up is sick.
[81:31.91]Alright, nice.
[81:32.41]Better head to the Kazama family office.
[81:33.73]What is that going and doing office stuff?
[81:40.60]Do you ever do it?
[81:41.08]Can I eventually get like on a car or like a motorcycle or something?
[81:48.52]You know what, let's get... Oh, wait.
[81:51.80]Delinquents.
[81:54.40]That's funny.
[81:57.95]Just delinquents.
[81:58.81]Don't worry, everybody.
[82:01.09]Let's crack some skulls.
[82:16.14]I guess I can.
[82:18.52]Wait, I can pick up this... Wow.
[82:21.78]Okay.
[82:23.58]They're actually scared of this shit.
[82:29.96]What am I doing?
[82:33.07]That was awesome.
[82:39.67]I thought that guy's brain exploded.
[82:48.72]What the fuck?
[82:49.16]Is this fighting?
[82:49.96]What the hell?
[82:50.40]You came here for cutscenes.
[82:52.52]I'm so sorry.
[82:53.94]Safe point.
[82:54.56]Oh, whatever.
[82:57.22]Just, I gotta go through this as fast as I can.
[83:01.71]But first, hold on.
[83:06.63]I can go in here.
[83:10.73]Can I go in here?
[83:13.40]I can.
[83:14.48]What is this?
[83:14.86]Is this like a convenience store?
[83:20.32]This is a cramped little spot.
[83:29.78]What is this?
[83:30.26]Is this just like a food store?
[83:31.52]It's like TVs everywhere.
[83:35.46]Are the TVs in a bunch of random, odd places that TVs shouldn't be?
[83:39.74]That's weird.
[83:43.04]Alright, what do you have?
[83:48.09]Well, I don't have any money.
[83:50.69]Cheaper price.
[83:51.55]What does this do?
[83:54.15]Charges up to... Let me get a couple of these.
[84:00.28]This is like a healing drink, right?
[84:03.28]Whatever.
[84:03.54]There's nothing here.
[84:17.72]That's all I can do.
[84:19.78]Buy a tuna can.
[84:24.63]I have 400,000?
[84:25.03]Yeah.
[84:25.47]Well, whatever.
[84:29.81]That's 400 bucks.
[84:30.47]That's not a whole lot of money.
[84:35.05]I'm gonna go.
[84:36.05]Let's keep the story going.
[84:37.46]I can't run in the street.
[84:39.26]Should I take the taxi?
[84:43.44]Okay.
[84:47.30]That's so annoying.
[84:48.49]I can't wait to upgrade that.
[84:49.59]That's the first thing I'm going to upgrade.
[84:51.13]Can I do that right now?
[84:59.33]Fuck.
[85:00.68]I don't know what that did.
[85:02.82]Alright, here's another cutscene, guys.
[85:09.04]Karaoke?
[85:12.41]That looks pretty good.
[85:13.07]Is that a piece of watermelon on top of meat?
[85:20.84]I think somebody's doing coke.
[85:24.67]Nope.
[85:25.33]Guy not doing coke off the table.
[85:26.99]He's eating noodles.
[85:28.27]Oh, this guy.
[85:35.53]Look at this coke this guy's doing.
[85:36.70]See?
[85:38.70]Yes?
[86:04.67]Captain of the Kazama family, a Dojima family subsidiary.
[86:07.35]Like, they have really long names.
[86:11.12]You can't put an abbreviation there?
[86:14.18]Something cool?
[86:14.76]Like, super...
[86:22.91]Califragilisticexpialidocious.
[86:25.51]Scum.
[86:25.87]So my name would be... Alright, sounds a little bit random.
[86:28.14]What'd I do?
[86:28.56]Okay, we're good.
[86:29.06]I see.
[86:52.64]Believe me that's short, some rulers in the middle ages had titles that were over a page long.
[86:56.00]Back to the empty lot.
[87:17.01]Alright, I'm gonna pee.
[87:17.99]I'll be right back.
[87:18.69]I'm gonna, like, pee and, like, enjoy this cutscene.
[87:20.73]I'm gonna, like, put text here.
[87:22.67]I'm just gonna say, like, enjoy the cutscene.
[87:24.29]That's what I'm listening to.
[87:25.77]You say you're sleeping on the land where all the politicians are.
[87:30.63]You must be hungry to sell that land.
[87:32.53]That's right.
[87:34.43]But in that, there's only one grain of rice that you can't get.
[87:48.05]That's one of them.
[87:50.89]Yeah.
[87:52.69]That's a recent one.
[87:53.41]I'll be right back.
[87:54.17]It's in the middle of the redevelopment site.
[87:56.20]As long as I don't get it, I won't be able to sell the surrounding land.
[88:02.06]So that's what happened.
[88:15.54]By the way, haven't you got that land yet?
[88:17.94]It seems that the owner is missing.
[88:20.98]If he comes out now, it will be worth 1 billion yen.
[88:25.40]1 billion yen?
[88:25.82]Only one grain of land?
[88:28.26]Yes.
[88:30.22]If you spend one grain of land, the redevelopment itself will be reversed.
[88:37.00]But the Dojima group has already invested more than 1 billion yen in the development of the surrounding area.
[88:45.57]Even if it's 100 million, I can't withdraw it now.
[88:50.11]Kuze said that Kazama-no-Oyasu-san has the necessary information to obtain that land.
[88:56.85]What information does Kazama-no-Oyasu-san have?
[89:00.73]No, I don't know.
[89:01.47]It's my first time hearing it.
[89:05.53]But it must be related to the owner of the land that has disappeared, right?
[89:14.41]No matter what you do, you're trying to get Kiryu to find out the truth from your father, right?
[89:24.28]Yeah.
[89:24.50]That's why I killed everyone.
[89:27.78]Do you guys understand the situation now?
[89:30.36]Kiryu, of course, and Kazama's father are the same.
[89:33.26]Kiryu killed the enemy, so the father of the adventurer will be punished.
[89:37.25]On top of that,
[89:44.87]If Kuze gets hold of one of the shells and becomes a young leader, he will definitely kick my father out of the group.
[89:53.98]Kick him out of the group?
[89:57.90]Don't tell me... There's even a Haman from the Dojima group?
[90:03.42]Yeah.
[90:03.58]Since my father is also in the office, I can't do anything right now.
[90:10.41]That old man is... Haman?
[90:15.08]I don't have to tell you the history of the destroyed Gokudo.
[90:18.12]There aren't many people who can endure the humiliation of the underworld once they've climbed up to the top.
[90:24.20]It's not uncommon for a suicide homeless to have the name of a former Gokudo engraved on it.
[90:29.71]B-But Kiryu actually didn't kill anyone.
[90:31.21]Even if you doubt this guy, you won't be able to destroy him, right?
[90:44.14]Without any doubt, we need to suppress the real culprit.
[90:47.02]That's right.
[90:50.14]But... Kuze can't do anything as long as he's holding the real culprit.
[90:54.12]The opponent is the leader of the Dojima group.
[90:57.89]In this world, it's unforgivable to get caught up in anything.
[91:02.01]But if we keep this up, Kiryu will be put in jail!
[91:05.09]If we give Kuze a chance, Kazama's father will be in a worse position.
[91:15.35]Are you fucking serious?
[91:19.69]This is still going?
[91:24.69]Wait, hold on.
[91:26.34]Wow.
[91:27.28]This is still fucking going.
[91:28.78]Okay, that's pretty remarkable.
[91:31.90]Okay.
[91:44.64]Nearly done.
[91:46.64]Alright, so give it a long and short of it.
[91:48.24]Hold on, hold on.
[91:48.98]Anything interesting?
[91:52.34]Welcome back to the movie.
[91:53.46]How's the movie going?
[91:54.06]Okay, the Yakuza might die.
[92:01.79]I'm going to leave the Yakuza.
[92:06.85]Alright, so I'm leaving the Yakuza pretty much, and I'm going to get killed for it.
[92:14.81]Yakuza is about as story-heavy as a game can get.
[92:17.11]I have no idea why he thought it was his kind of game.
[92:21.26]I think he might be Yakuza.
[92:27.58]Professional streamer, please.
[92:29.26]I'm back.
[92:29.68]What are you talking about?
[92:32.56]I got the sake, and I've been a Yakuza for three years.
[92:39.14]There's no way I can get away with it.
[92:41.72]This is terrible.
[92:44.66]I like beating people up and I like running around and shit.
[92:47.58]Let me beat some more people up.
[92:58.22]I don't care.
[93:00.46]I'm just gonna suck him up and drink him.
[93:03.68]I don't even care.
[93:05.07]You guys ever, like, think like that?
[93:07.67]Like, I just... This is, like, a nice, good drink that I fucking made.
[93:11.19]Fly lands and ruins the drink.
[93:13.17]Just suck the fucking fly up and swallow it.
[93:14.83]Just be a fucking man about it.
[93:16.43]You know what I mean?
[93:18.35]Stop it, Kiryu.
[93:27.11]I'm interested in the game.
[93:28.27]I think it's like a fun game.
[93:30.39]This might be a little bloated.
[93:31.91]Ah, my shin!
[93:54.03]Oh, I don't want him to know how bad my shit hurts right now.
[93:58.31]Did I do that already?
[93:59.13]I did that already, like fucking 20 minutes ago.
[94:01.75]Sorry.
[94:02.03]Sorry, guys.
[94:02.47]Jesus.
[94:02.69]Forgive me, Mr. Kazumaki.
[94:24.75]How long until the immortal redneck scream starts?

[96:09.38]Let's go on a date.
[96:13.71]You play Late Shift, which is literally a movie, and you're complaining about cutscenes.
[96:17.27]But the thing about Late Shift is that the point of the game was for you to choose which cutscene you wanted to watch.
[96:24.54]How do I get a choice in which cutscene I watch in Yakuza?
[96:29.87]Right here?
[96:31.75]Alright, let's go on a date.
[96:39.45]Let's go on a date with ourselves.

[103:12.98]He's in really awkward shape.
[103:14.04]He's not easy to get.
[103:19.81]I sucked up the fly and I spit it back out.
[103:21.29]I'm not a man.
[103:23.45]I'm not a real man.
[103:24.55]I spit him back out.
[103:25.79]I tried.

[103:35.32]That's money right there.
[103:44.82]Let's go I did it first try don't even matter.
[103:48.90]I already beat the game Rename it to claw stream So when do we get to the game?
[104:07.05]I love that I'm making all these jokes and talking all this shit about how this is a movie stream.
[104:11.25]And the next PlayStation 4 game I want to stream is Until Dawn.
[104:16.01]That is like a full movie stream.
[104:19.43]Let's just continue the story.
[104:20.53]Whatever.
[104:22.86]This is the game.
[104:33.86]Movie night.
[104:36.40]Yeah, this is just a- we're doing movie night part one.
[104:42.55]Until Dawn is much better.
[104:47.79]Until Dawn is gonna be fun.
[104:49.63]Because we're gonna get to choose.
[104:50.55]I think we're gonna- here we go.
[104:55.63]We got a major gameplay situation here.
[105:01.18]You like the stream title?
[105:02.04]It's pretty creative.
[105:02.74]Thanks.
[105:04.45]I literally wrote the name of the game.
[105:07.11]That's it.
[105:07.51]I can choose in late shift.
[105:18.92]We already got all the endings in late shift.
[105:20.40]Why don't we do it again?
[105:33.20]Why, Oya-san?
[105:35.22]Our path will be decided by ourselves.
[105:38.26]The truth that we were raised by humans is another story.
[105:44.71]You're a zennin now.
[105:45.71]You're a Yakuza too, aren't you?
[106:02.41]Hey, thank you, Never Trust Purple for the 10 bucks.
[106:04.47]You just spent 85% of your total funds to buy a limited-use weapon that probably does 2 damage.
[106:09.75]Slick Yakuza.
[106:14.26]Thank you, Purple.
[106:16.20]Thank you also to Tub Tucker and Premium Pillow.

[107:11.40]Where is it?
[107:11.98]Purple, you just gave $100.
[107:13.92]And it didn't even pop up.
[107:14.88]Something's wrong with my stream labs.
[107:29.94]Because I do not see this.
[107:34.92]Anyways, Purple.
[107:37.40]Thank you for the hundred dollars.
[107:40.92]For the funniest fuck on the internet, you honestly deserve a primetime TV slot where you make literally anything funny.

[109:03.46]I'm surprised I'm still here.
[109:05.68]Let alone the 1,700 people that are here right now.

[109:31.90]I gotta take down the boss and I have to be the leader of the Yakuza.
[109:35.08]I thought that guy had a camera on his belt.
[109:36.50]It was just a giant belt buckle.
[109:46.38]Oh, he did the lean in whisper thing.
[109:48.96]Like every bad guy movie.
[109:51.58]I think I did drink the fly.
[109:54.10]I don't see him anymore.
[109:56.18]Oh, there he is.
[109:57.59]There he is.
[110:04.01]He's drinking around him.
[110:15.41]This isn't a game for you.
[110:17.51]It's alright, though.
[110:18.51]This is okay.
[110:19.07]This game's not... I'm not upset about this game.

[110:35.33]Whatever.
[110:35.63]It's okay.
[110:45.68]No, not every stream has to be, like, funny.
[110:51.64]There's gotta be some streams where we just sit down and talk and have fun, and what's funny and what's not funny.
[111:01.75]Like, chat complain stream.
[111:03.95]Yeah, see, like, the other night, I was the complain streamer.
[111:09.03]You don't seem to be enjoying yourself.
[111:10.29]I'm not.
[111:11.09]I'm enjoying myself.
[111:12.99]If you... Oh, you've... You should see when I don't enjoy myself on a stream.
[111:21.14]You'll know.
[111:22.48]You can tell if I'm not having fun. ...
[111:38.16]Do I like this game?
[111:39.90]I don't know.
[111:41.66]I need some more time with it to know.
[111:43.46]Skate 3.
[111:44.06]Complain stream phase 2.

[112:45.00]This is where it happens.
[112:45.66]This is the big ticket.
[112:48.26]Did I just age?
[112:49.44]Oh, I thought that was me.
[112:50.48]I thought that was fucking my character there.
[112:55.92]I thought the whole game was a flashback until right now.
[113:13.43]The big ticket to the next movie.
[113:19.53]Sorry you can't donate anything.
[113:24.87]I just spent all my money on college with my internet love account.
[113:27.63]Ashbringer, you had never expected to spend any money.
[113:32.56]There's a shitload of people in this room.
[113:34.26]This is where it's about to get real interesting.
[113:35.82]What are you going to do with your brother?
[113:44.30]Oh, God.
[113:46.03]Here comes the fall room of men.
[113:50.33]Let me pick up the couch and swing it around.
[113:59.99]Uh-oh.
[114:00.41]Kuzeno-aniki!
[114:12.97]Come on, bring it on.
[114:13.89]Let's go.

[114:23.77]He's testing me.
[114:25.49]This is a test.
[114:35.12]He wants me to be the new lieutenant.
[114:36.82]I have to beat up a room full of lieutenants before I can be the new lieutenant.
[114:43.96]There you go.
[114:52.53]Now get surrounded, boys.
[115:00.63]This is it.
[115:02.39]I'm gonna go rush mode and I'm gonna smash on square.
[115:06.76]Here we go, a room full of men.
[115:12.39]The whole Dojima family.
[115:14.89]The cousins, the uncles, the aunts.
[115:17.33]Every sibling is here.
[115:19.49]I knew I was going to be able to pick up a fucking couch.
[115:26.16]Even the stepson, the stepdaughter.
[115:29.08]They didn't expect they were going to hit with a fucking couch.
[115:31.26]Come on, let me make my shitty stream joke.
[115:37.64]Can I pick the table up, please?
[115:38.74]Let me pick the table up.
[115:44.29]God damn it.
[115:45.17]Get out of here like the fucking one drunk uncle fucking calm down Oh shit that was cool.
[115:58.52]Oh my god is this Dead Rising?
[116:00.24]He looks like zombies.
[116:06.09]Holy shit that was fast
[116:16.71]I'm gonna phase.
[116:19.13]Nice.
[116:22.45]Holy shit.
[116:27.47]Let's do this one.
[116:28.67]Put the Dark Souls around for a little bit.
[116:38.64]Oh, I can't fix it up in this mode, huh?
[117:02.57]Only two guys left.
[117:04.05]What is this?
[117:05.35]Throw the fucking Bible at him.
[117:09.69]You're about to get fucking Bible'd.
[117:16.15]Anything else?
[117:18.05]I gotta do a cool finishing move, right?
[117:19.63]I gotta end this.
[117:21.43]I gotta end this.
[117:22.79]Like, really?
[117:24.45]Love of bread?
[117:24.95]I think that guy died.
[117:29.11]I'm pretty sure he's dead.
[117:31.40]No, I'm not.
[117:37.56]Get the TV?
[117:37.96]No.
[117:41.38]Swords?
[117:41.76]No.
[117:51.28]Yeah, I have to kill a guy with that.
[117:52.64]That's important.
[117:53.70]Oh, just fucking throw the couch at him.
[117:56.90]He's dead.
[117:58.66]Oh, God, you killed everybody.
[118:00.42]Okay, I gotta stop fucking around.
[118:03.23]I need that stick.
[118:13.77]That guy's got a baseball bat.
[118:16.35]Holy shit.
[118:26.06]Is there like a stomp I can do on the ground?
[118:31.07]Shit, that hurt.
[118:46.23]Ow.
[118:48.42]That was fun.
[118:49.98]Alright, who's next?
[118:53.68]Another guy gonna run in?
[118:55.18]Nope.
[118:55.90]Nope, I gotta keep running.
[118:59.04]Pick up the laundry detergent.
[119:00.40]Okay.
[119:11.32]Uh, why would you try to protect your face with glass?
[119:15.36]Why would you do that?
[119:18.57]That seems very, very not intelligent.
[119:21.67]Oh no, he's gonna punch me in the face.
[119:22.91]I've got to put a glass plate in front of my face.
[119:25.31]This is like a floss, I gotta be careful.
[119:41.71]Let's break this guy's fucking neck.
[119:45.67]There you go.
[119:55.59]Get couched!
[119:58.69]Uh, I need to... I want to end this with, like, throwing a piece of paper at him.
[120:02.18]This guy has to get fucking humiliated.
[120:03.84]Hold on.
[120:05.10]Plant?
[120:05.44]No.
[120:08.61]Get the couch out of the way.
[120:09.47]Well, that's not what I wanted, but it's okay.
[120:13.61]Alright, whatever.
[120:25.78]Is the game audio out of sync, or am I out of sync?
[120:37.09]Really?
[120:37.47]Just holding the couch.
[120:41.11]Okay.
[120:41.51]Well, that's fine.
[120:47.23]What?
[120:48.53]What?
[120:48.93]What?
[120:53.97]Okay.
[120:54.21]Well, this guy is the equivalent of a Mario Womp guy.
[120:57.76]Whatever they are.
[120:58.56]What are those things called?
[120:59.96]The Womp people.
[121:03.32]We just have to bait it out and just dodge.
[121:14.70]Let's just do this over and over again, that's fine.
[121:23.81]Oh fu- really?
[121:24.83]Is this guy gonna kill me?
[121:27.13]This stationary guy with the couch is gonna kill me.
[121:36.44]Why is this- I'll be back.
[121:39.74]You stay right there, couch guy.
[121:42.70]That's fine.
[121:57.41]Oh, I do have a healing item, don't I?
[122:02.30]Hey, there we go.
[122:07.20]Do it!
[122:14.30]Eat the box of nails.
[122:16.20]No, fine.
[122:16.80]You want to be double couch guy?
[122:20.12]Fine.
[122:21.75]I can do this.
[122:25.00]Eat the business cards?
[122:25.80]Oh, I could, yeah, I could.
[122:26.44]Oh, wait a minute.
[122:26.92]Good idea.
[122:27.61]Hold on.
[122:27.83]Let's see if I can... Let me see what this does first.
[122:32.25]Okay, I just, like, gave him another counter to play with.
[122:35.99]How do I equip this weapon?
[122:39.31]Here we go.
[122:39.63]Business cards.
[122:43.88]How do I throw them?
[122:48.08]I have 30 of them.
[122:48.54]I don't think I can throw these.
[122:56.23]Okay, he's dead.
[122:57.73]That took much longer than I thought it was gonna take.
[123:03.98]He's back again.
[123:05.00]Oh, it's one card, 30 durability.
[123:14.36]Oh, shit.
[123:21.23]That's the guy with the little bar stool.
[123:24.43]You're not helping, dude.
[123:26.55]You're just making yourself look like a dumbass.
[123:35.70]Oh!
[123:38.04]Did I just stuff that in his mouth?
[123:41.20]That was pretty radical, I'm not gonna lie.
[123:49.68]Oh, he's still alive.
[123:51.34]Did not belong.
[123:58.18]Why does this guy get a special cutscene?
[123:59.58]No, just to open another door.
[124:00.70]I like that.
[124:01.20]That's awesome.
[124:05.47]Oh, come on.
[124:06.07]Give me the whole table.
[124:08.43]Somebody please come in here.
[124:13.02]No, I want the table.
[124:14.57]I want to set this table up and suplex somebody through it.
[124:18.27]There we go.
[124:18.61]It's this fucking guy again!
[124:26.12]Seriously, come on!
[124:27.48]Give me a break!
[124:31.36]Don't you have- has this guy ever watched a horror movie?
[124:41.95]Wait, oh my god, I gotta burn this guy's face.
[124:44.47]This definitely burned the guy's face on the skull.
[124:48.03]It has to be.
[124:51.81]I can't wait to take this guy away.
[124:52.71]I gotta burn the shit out of this guy's face.
[124:53.95]Come here.
[125:05.50]Burn his face on the skull.
[125:16.16]You know, whatever.
[125:24.66]Heat move with the box of nails?
[125:26.89]Where's the box of nails?
[125:27.81]Alright, I'm gonna heat move with this.
[125:41.06]Oh, god damn it.
[125:44.87]The stove has to be on.
[125:50.10]Alright, I'll take it.
[126:01.04]How do you do the heat move with this, the rush mode?
[126:04.34]I can't figure it out.
[126:16.11]Walk from the other side.
[126:19.83]Climb through the window.
[126:24.20]Oh, it's an upgrade.
[126:25.16]Okay.
[126:25.74]I get you.
[126:34.06]Oh, these guys have Pissin' in the bathroom.
[126:35.64]This is perfect.
[126:36.92]Make sure you zip up first, boys.
[126:51.81]into the stall with you.
[126:57.49]Now, this game just got, like, exceptionally more fun.
[127:00.47]Do the sink.
[127:13.18]Do something with the sink.
[127:15.77]Oh, here we go.
[127:18.08]Nope.
[127:18.56]Just stomp on his face.
[127:20.08]That works.
[127:32.57]I like the fast punching in this stuff.
[127:45.35]It's me again!
[127:46.13]This time I have a knife!
[128:02.11]Oh, shit.
[128:09.90]Damn it, I can't do the EX move to him.
[128:11.20]Come here, you fucking asshole.
[128:24.77]Drop the knife.
[128:29.06]Really?
[128:29.44]Drop the fucking knife!
[128:32.88]Oh god, I'm dead!
[128:34.48]He stabbed me right in the gut!
[128:36.71]Wait a minute, wait a minute, I have a fucking healing serum, right?
[128:38.93]Yeah.
[128:52.90]Oh boy.
[129:00.85]Get me out of the corner, please.
[129:04.11]Drink this too.
[129:04.71]Alright, stay down.
[129:22.24]Oh, there's piss in there too.
[129:37.60]Oh, this guy's fucked.
[129:40.06]If that guy comes back, I'm gonna be so mad.
[129:46.91]I'm going to be furious if that guy comes back.
[129:57.57]I'm gonna take this.
[130:08.14]Why not?
[130:11.04]Please let me have the couch in the cutscene.
[130:17.83]He's going to land on a passing truck full of feathers.
[130:19.71]I thought that was him.
[130:27.56]Well, he's a boss.
[130:28.54]Kazama's head...
[130:38.80]I scouted a good kid.
[130:39.82]When I was still boxing, I wanted to meet you or become a promoter.
[130:48.77]I'm coming.
[130:49.35]Spit it out before you lose your mouth.
[130:54.76]One of the things I want to do is... The kid got on my nerves.
[131:06.91]I did get stabbed.
[131:07.75]Took a lot of health too.
[131:10.80]Well, this is the first boss.
[131:16.36]Yep.
[131:20.78]I'm going to have to switch to boxing mode.
[131:23.05]Do you hear me?
[131:23.61]I hear the boxer.
[131:24.29]Yeah.
[131:32.09]That's pretty built for a 78-year-old man.
[131:35.05]I thought he was gonna pull a mask off.
[131:44.75]Alright, we're gonna go to boxing mode.
[131:47.74]Boxing mode, here we go.
[131:51.28]Tojima Family Lieutenant, Tojo Clan.
[132:04.32]Let's do it.
[132:12.97]I lose.
[132:13.41]This guy's got fire hands!
[132:18.35]Hold on a minute.
[132:18.93]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[132:20.29]I wasn't ready for this.
[132:21.13]I wasn't trained.
[132:21.81]That, like, drunk guy with the white hair didn't teach you any more moves.
[132:26.01]Oh, fuck.
[132:26.61]Alright, we're good.
[132:45.98]What the fuck is with this thing getting dropped?
[132:56.33]Now move the camera.
[133:10.79]I'm gonna fucking die.
[133:12.39]Do I have any more drugs?
[133:13.87]Wait, I'm pulling out a weapon.
[133:15.88]I'm gonna fucking cheat here.
[133:16.84]I don't have any more drugs left.
[133:24.96]Am I supposed to win this?
[133:27.84]I don't think I'm supposed to beat this guy.
[133:29.25]I don't think I'm supposed to win.
[133:39.28]Maybe I am.
[133:40.44]Like, can we just throw business cards at him?
[133:41.92]Fuck.
[133:48.92]We're gonna die.
[133:54.09]We're gonna die right here.
[134:04.41]Okay, I can't lose.
[134:06.83]I'm gonna lose.
[134:13.36]Not if we do this like a fucking wuss.
[134:17.18]At least I can like break some of his expensive stuff.
[134:30.56]You gotta fight him in this mode, for sure.
[134:33.38]I just didn't learn any of the new moves.
[134:53.19]I wish I could do something with this.
[135:02.37]Invest in yourself.
[135:05.35]Uh... We're gonna try again.
[135:08.22]I have no upgrades.
[135:14.84]What the fuck?
[135:48.58]I can upgrade into Medius?
[135:50.42]Why the fuck didn't I know that?
[136:16.14]On the ground.
[136:17.80]Stop his face.
[136:22.16]Invest in yourself.
[136:30.65]On the ground.
[136:33.43]Alright, one more of those.
[136:40.72]Stop his face.
[136:49.13]Shit!
[136:49.63]No!
[136:50.37]No, I got greedy!
[136:51.21]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[137:12.86]I was not ready for that.
[137:15.18]I was so not prepared for that one.
[137:26.38]Don't ever forget the face stomp.
[137:29.16]It's important.
[137:41.87]Face!
[137:53.58]Face!
[137:53.96]Nope!
[137:56.42]Face!
[138:00.61]Nope!
[138:24.52]On the ground, you fucking asshole!
[138:48.16]No, you do it!
[139:04.01]No, shit!
[139:11.05]I'm so dead.
[139:11.66]I'm gonna lose.
[139:12.60]I'm gonna fucking lose.
[139:14.76]I'm dead.
[139:15.12]I lost.
[139:15.92]Oh my fucking god.
[139:18.54]What the fuck?
[139:28.13]No, like what the fuck?
[139:30.99]Why was this game two hours of cutscenes and then an extremely hard boss fight?
[139:36.31]Is anybody fucking- What the fuck?
[139:40.27]This is- What the fuck is this shit?
[139:42.43]Alright, hold on.
[139:53.62]Oh, I think I want this.
[140:02.56]I like the rush mode.
[140:04.04]I gotta spend money on the rush mode.
[140:05.30]I do.
[140:09.60]I need a heat.
[140:11.88]Where's like a heat mode thing?
[140:13.95]Oh, I want this.
[140:25.86]This stream just got so much more entertaining.
[140:31.62]I'm doing this.
[140:32.10]And then hold triangle.
[140:37.58]Okay.
[140:43.99]Frighten the enemy.
[140:46.41]Interesting.
[140:52.81]Can I do anything else?
[140:53.45]I can do this.
[140:55.31]Intimidate the enemy.
[140:59.40]Heat wave one.
[141:01.78]I can't do this yet.
[141:12.75]Is there anything else I can get that's not listed here?
[141:16.01]What about the other one?
[141:21.47]Flying Kick.
[141:22.86]Boost Health.
[141:26.64]Evasive Weaving.
[141:27.68]Where do you see that?
[141:35.75]Improve quick step.
[141:36.93]Where's evasive weaving?
[141:41.13]Oh, here.
[141:44.35]Weave away from enemy during a rush combo.
[141:47.03]Okay, they're going to, like, hold and press X during... Okay.
[141:53.50]Interesting.
[141:59.22]Can I do anything else?
[142:00.34]Nope.
[142:00.80]Maximum health.
[142:01.38]I'll boost maximum health.
[142:06.67]Okay, now like should I fight?
[142:07.93]Now I can fight this guy because I actually upgraded my character.
[142:10.24]Alright, now I have upgrades, but let me see what these things did.
[142:17.74]So when you're on the ground, s-s-square-l.
[142:20.38]Square-l.
[142:22.54]Okay.
[142:23.84]And this is you punch and then hold that.
[142:28.73]Rush combo, okay.
[142:31.19]And then I hold this and press X during the attack, alright.
[142:34.45]I'm gonna have to like learn how to use this shit.
[142:37.73]I'm going to die 3% slower.
[142:39.13]Alright, hold on.
[142:42.15]Look at how much more damage I'm doing too.
[142:47.13]I'm going to destroy this guy.
[142:48.68]Alright, X. Oh, ow.
[143:08.87]Is that the charge punch?
[143:10.37]Probably shouldn't be trying to figure this out in a boss fight.
[143:16.49]I think that was good.
[143:21.75]This boss is actually so hard for the first boss in the game.
[143:24.73]What you meant to say is this boss is so hard for the first actual enemy in the fucking game.
[143:29.40]Not like three random thugs that like die in two hits.
[143:33.16]They did not prepare me for this.
[143:35.40]At all.
[143:58.93]Watch out.
[144:06.31]Do your big combo thing.
[144:15.60]How come that, why is that move not working?
[144:20.40]Step on his head!
[144:48.29]Head stomp.
[144:49.42]Alright, I should get it this time.
[144:57.44]Nooo!
[144:58.78]Agh!
[144:59.78]Woah, what the fuck was that?
[145:13.46]What the hell was that?
[145:14.40]He just, like, glitched back up.
[145:21.18]Why is he... Fuck.
[145:36.98]Oh my god.
[145:40.28]How come he's not getting, like, staggered?
[145:42.22]I'm gonna lose again.
[145:52.52]I'm not prepared for this guy.
[145:53.92]I really am not.
[146:18.23]If I lose here again, I'm gonna throw up on camera.
[146:26.02]I'm like just getting so greedy, just get the fuck out of the way.
[146:28.51]And get a combo.
[146:33.71]WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!
[146:36.01]WHAT WAS THAT SHIT?!
[146:38.27]I'm so angry right now.
[146:44.78]THEY'RE GONNA LOSE!
[146:50.77]GET ME IN!
[146:58.44]This game gets so hard.
[147:00.00]It was a bunch of talking.
[147:01.58]It was a bunch of talking and then like a Dark Souls boss No, I don't want to fight any more people Phase two
[147:28.30]Now 21 minutes of cutscenes.
[147:39.27]Who the fuck is this?
[147:47.54]Oh, this is the real boss.
[147:50.74]Okay.
[147:50.94]Oh, this is Mr. Jojima.
[147:58.10]This is the actual, like, leader of the whole thing.
[148:01.31]They're going to kill that guy, aren't they?
[148:03.05]Kazama's bowl is so far away.
[148:08.17]But, Father!
[148:08.53]This is the kid that the leader picked up!
[148:12.35]Kiryu Kazama!
[148:31.12]Hmm.
[148:31.64]I hear you wasted a guy.
[148:34.26]I did?
[148:34.48]You sound like a fucking idiot.
[148:49.28]Watch out for that fly.
[148:51.00]I swear I'm not going to kill you.
[148:54.94]However, as much as you doubt me, I can't cause you any trouble.
[149:00.45]So please... make me your enemy.
[149:06.11]Don't say such a nice thing, you bastard!
[149:07.99]I'll... I'll get rid of him!
[149:11.11]Boom.
[149:11.25]He's going to get shot in the face.
[149:12.21]I won't cause trouble to my father anymore.
[149:14.99]You...
[149:20.99]So it looks like that was the real Elvis.
[149:26.47]I told you I picked the right one.
[149:49.11]Saying a lot of officious for me.
[149:50.77]He's gonna do like some line like that.
[150:17.01]Here, this board right here?
[150:18.67]Break it, and you can stay in the clan.
[150:27.61]Oh, no.
[150:30.87]No.
[150:31.07]Come on, brother.
[150:35.87]You know the rules of the Kusei sword world, don't you?
[150:40.40]It's your brother's favorite, Keiji Ue.
[150:50.40]Show us what you want to do.
[150:56.24]Not gonna lie, the character models are good.
[150:57.78]The game looks good.
[151:05.70]Accountability shit.
[151:17.47]Is he gonna cut his hand off?
[151:19.45]Oh.
[151:20.57]That's just a pinky.
[151:21.43]You don't even need it to turn doorknobs.
[151:26.85]You're fine.
[151:27.99]What do you even do with a pinky anyways?
[151:29.27]That's not even that bad.
[151:31.47]I thought they were gonna make him- I thought they were gonna kill him or something.
[151:46.68]It's so they can't hold weapons.
[151:48.42]Oh.
[151:51.37]Now he can't play guitar.
[151:58.80]Now he can't... Now he'll never play the fucking trumpet.
[152:02.48]His favorite instrument.
[152:03.44]Kiryu Kazuma.
[152:11.25]Thank you very much, Kiryu.
[152:30.71]You don't need a pinky for the trumpet?
[152:32.75]Yeah, you do.
[152:33.73]It's the one that goes like the very end.
[152:37.16]The last one is three knobs.
[152:39.50]Your thumb rests underneath.
[152:42.96]Your thumb is on the hole, the air hole thing on the right, the left, whatever.
[152:49.02]Your index finger, ring finger, and middle finger are on the buttons.
[152:53.58]And then the pinky finger is on the fourth button.
[153:01.20]It's on three nubs.
[153:07.23]The pinky goes on one of those three nubs.
[153:10.73]Your pinky goes on the little hook, yeah, and then you pull it back and forth.
[153:13.83]And it goes like... It's a fucking... Your pinky, it's very important.
[153:19.42]That's a French horn.
[153:20.38]They're all the same.
[153:24.91]Have any of you guys ever seen one where all the horns are the same?
[153:27.53]I want to- Alright, fine.
[153:29.21]Here we go.
[153:30.00]You guys think that you're so smart.
[153:31.94]You wanna try to decipher a fucking horn?
[153:34.36]Fine.
[153:37.12]Here.
[153:39.10]This is important to me.
[153:40.32]I don't give a shit about this game right now.
[153:42.40]This is more important.
[153:43.78]We're gonna do something, guys.
[153:45.20]I wanna know if you guys think you can, like, decipher what, like, horn is what horn.
[153:48.86]Like, please.
[153:52.36]Give me a second.
[153:53.70]I need to get my... I don't really think they know about horns.
[154:00.30]All the horns sound the fucking exact same.
[154:01.68]Okay.
[154:01.84]Okay, so you tell me what the hell this is.
[154:05.00]What is this?
[154:05.48]No, I don't need a website.
[154:09.64]Hold on.
[154:22.94]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[154:23.90]Everyone thinks they're so smart.
[154:26.95]Yeah, what horn is this?
[154:28.15]Can anybody even hear this?
[154:31.61]I don't think anybody can even hear this noise.
[154:36.21]No, they can't.
[154:38.05]Why can't nobody hear this?
[154:39.69]Kiryu, because of your indecision, it has become difficult to get a hold of that land.
[154:52.70]Why can my desktop sound?
[154:54.14]Alright, did that work?
[154:55.22]Okay, here we go.
[154:56.06]So, you try and tell me, everyone thinks they're so smart.
[155:03.49]What is this?
[155:05.85]What is this?
[155:31.48]Yeah, what is- what kind of- What kind of horn is that?
[155:35.44]Oh!
[155:47.03]Oh, everyone, hello!
[155:48.03]Trombone, huh?
[155:49.07]Everyone's saying trombone.
[155:50.25]Sorry, guys.
[155:51.35]That was a French horn, not a trombone.
[155:53.95]Sorry!
[155:57.09]You lose.
[155:59.21]What about this one?
[156:00.15]Everyone's so smart.
[156:02.64]What horn is this?
[156:11.33]Hold on.
[156:13.75]You guys are so fucking smart, huh?
[156:18.69]Don't guess on that one.
[156:19.63]Hold on.
[156:19.95]Don't guess.
[156:22.28]Don't fucking guess on that one.
[156:27.98]Yeah.
[156:32.27]There you go.
[156:32.73]What about this one?
[156:33.91]My name is Tachibana.
[156:36.99]I can tell you what this one was without even needing to know.
[156:39.71]Without even hearing it for five seconds.
[156:41.37]The situation you're in right now is the same as any other situation.
[156:45.78]I... This is the modern tenor trombone.
[156:48.18]I've been waiting for this for a long time.
[156:51.08]Alright, the joke's over.
[156:55.11]We're done.
[156:57.89]I'm going back to plugging in my headphones on this other thing.
[157:00.33]Would you like to listen?
[157:03.66]You guys didn't even fucking know.
[157:06.05]Nobody even knew.
[157:06.71]The point is I got the first one everyone said trombone and it was... I thought that was a fucking crash error on the screen.
[157:20.40]I thought it was warning me that like the game crashed.
[157:30.66]Hey, thank you, Minz, for the $6.58 drum corpse stream.
[157:36.90]I don't know what drum corpse is.
[157:39.24]Thank you, though.
[157:41.69]Premium pillow, thanks for the bits.
[157:42.81]I'm trying to read the game's fucking story and you're playing a damn horn.
[157:47.35]But you can read.
[157:48.17]You can just mute the stream while the trombones are in the background.
[157:54.96]Do the side quests?
[157:55.74]We'll do some side quests.
[157:56.64]Alright.
[157:57.14]Also, Premium Pillow also gave $31.51.
[157:59.54]They said good job a few minutes ago.
[158:03.23]Thank you, Premium Pillow.
[158:04.15]That's $31.51.
[158:05.11]Thanks for the bits.
[158:09.63]Thanks.
[158:10.61]Alright.
[158:14.35]Earned through minigames, zero.
[158:15.41]Earned through business, zero.
[158:16.47]Earned through battle, 8.2 million.
[158:19.27]And a little bit of a bonus.
[158:20.76]Cool.
[158:22.68]Sure, let's save the data.
[158:27.08]Holy shit.
[158:32.08]Okay, my throat just fucking caved in for a second.
[158:35.98]You're telling me that if I died, or if I exited the game or something, that's three hours of time that I wouldn't have saved?
[158:43.29]I would never play this game again.
[158:45.93]Holy shit.
[158:46.65]Okay.
[158:54.59]That would have been so depressing.
[159:01.34]It's alright, we got another cutscene.
[159:02.92]Everybody chill out.
[159:09.01]It's alright.
[159:10.23]I'll go do karaoke again.
[159:11.15]We'll do some side quests.
[159:12.49]And then we'll see where we're at.
[159:15.67]Local shitty streamer never saves the game.
[159:21.12]I thought it was like an autosave.
[159:22.24]We're in like 2017.
[159:22.76]This game doesn't have an autosave?
[159:28.24]And finish your tattoo.
[159:29.74]That's not even filled in.
[159:31.01]What the hell?
[159:46.99]You remember pogs, but not shaving.
[159:48.78]Oh, gross.
[159:49.00]Meat is murder.
[160:00.59]I'm sorry.
[160:04.37]The chat is going to fucking lose its mind now because I just said that.
[160:09.83]I'm not a vegetarian or anything.
[160:11.97]That was a fucking dumb joke.
[160:15.76]Don't everybody freak the fuck out.
[160:17.38]My clothes...
[160:23.75]I knew it.
[160:24.17]God damn it.
[160:24.51]I had fucking chicken.
[160:25.49]I had like chicken earlier today.
[160:26.77]I ate like fucking turkey, chicken, mashed potatoes, gravy, asparagus.
[160:52.93]Crab cakes.
[160:54.75]Crab rangoons.
[160:57.51]A strawberry banana smoothie.
[161:00.37]A six ounce hamburger.
[161:02.93]And a side of bacon.
[161:05.87]Like an hour and a half ago.
[161:08.64]While I was away.
[161:09.40]It's Thanksgiving.
[161:16.49]Yeah, when I was BRB peeing on stream, I just dragged it all across the table into my mouth as fast as I could.
[161:23.95]Even half of it's on the floor.
[161:25.89]I'm gonna give you a little bit of an opinion here.
[161:29.93]If you wear your napkin like that, you're a dickhead.
[161:33.71]What, is that a napkin or is that part of a shirt?
[161:35.29]I don't know.
[161:36.23]I didn't pay attention.
[161:37.69]Is that one of those napkin bibs?
[161:39.91]I think that actually might be a shirt.
[161:47.27]Tojo?
[161:49.19]Wait, what happened?
[161:51.21]Okay, it wasn't that.
[161:52.28]I thought he was wearing one of those fluffy pirate shirts for a second.
[161:55.34]What are you talking about?
[161:57.74]It's a sunflower.
[162:08.98]They're talking about sunflowers now.
[162:14.10]Anybody care about this?
[162:14.94]Somebody does.
[162:16.18]That's why I'm letting it go.
[162:17.02]We're getting introduced to a new character in Yakuza.
[162:21.24]Might as well sit here for 20 minutes and listen to this.
[162:39.58]I followed Kazama-san, my father, and entered the world of Gokudo.
[162:46.67]And now, I'm the victim of murder.
[162:49.15]Because of that, Kazama-san is also in danger of murder.
[162:55.90]That's enough.
[162:56.54]Now I understand why you investigated me.
[162:59.46]I can't hear these videos.
[163:02.86]I'm trying to listen to these videos.
[163:05.76]I can't even hear them.
[163:18.74]This is called Funny Tuba Song.
[163:20.24]This is Tuba Funny.
[163:21.48]The name of this video is Tuba Funny.
[163:24.70]This is funny.
[163:25.34]Shut the fuck up.
[163:27.18]I'm watching the movie.
[163:31.08]What?
[163:46.39]It's pretty funny.
[163:47.39]This is my first Yakuza game.
[163:49.65]I think it's fun.
[164:06.58]Hahaha, so funny.
[164:08.87]I just noticed I'm still in this bathrobe.
[164:12.43]Oh, can we talk about this for a second?
[164:15.59]Like, I fucking, when I go to hotels, and you're in a hotel room, and it's a beautiful room, whatever, huge, they all have huge windows.
[164:23.14]Can I get a hotel that doesn't have a gigantic wall that's a window?
[164:28.25]Because I walk around naked.
[164:29.41]I'm a nude walker.
[164:30.65]I get out of the shower.
[164:31.45]I comb my hair.
[164:32.17]And I'm naked.
[164:33.14]And I walk around.
[164:33.76]You can't do... People can just look into your fucking hotel room and just see everything.
[164:40.20]All of it.
[164:41.34]Because anytime... You're usually staying downtown or wherever.
[164:44.22]People can just fucking look at you.
[164:45.38]And those curtains.
[164:47.19]Little curtains.
[164:47.89]They pull across.
[164:48.87]Oh, yeah.
[164:49.31]Nobody can see through those.
[164:51.67]Some creepy motherfucker will have binoculars going right through the line of the curtain.
[164:57.27]Where's my small window in a hotel room?
[164:59.65]Just a little one, like one of those little slide up ones.
[165:01.71]I don't want a whole wall as a window.
[165:05.31]There's too much.
[165:16.45]If you have it, you might as well flaunt it.
[165:20.89]Alright, let's do some side stuff.
[165:25.08]Close the curtains.
[165:25.58]Those curtains aren't that thick.
[165:28.10]Alright, let's save it.
[165:32.86]And let's do some side missions.
[165:48.75]That's the definition of a first world problem.
[165:52.66]Yeah, but like, you know, the, like, this day and age, who knows?
[165:54.74]People have, like, fucking cell phone cameras.
[165:56.84]Who knows if somebody's gonna snap a photo of me?
[165:59.44]You know, like, I'm, like, sitting there, like, itching my head, looking out the window, like, I got one arm on one side, I'm, like, really wriggly standing in front of the window, like, right in front of the window.
[166:07.93]Everyone's got a fucking iPhone.
[166:09.43]Somebody zooms in and takes a picture of my penis.
[166:11.51]And all of a sudden, like, I get tweeted at Jerma985, hey, like, nice junk, in quotes, and then I'm ruined.
[166:22.71]What can I do?
[166:32.11]Practice your battings?
[166:33.17]There's batting cages?
[166:34.09]Okay, that's awesome.
[166:34.79]I need to do that.
[166:35.65]Yeah.
[166:37.48]No more.
[166:37.80]I want to do the batting cages.
[166:38.62]I'm going to take a left.
[166:42.26]Is that a challenge?
[166:44.08]Why are you so worried?
[166:45.10]Ruined.
[166:47.97]No, we're not gonna... There's nothing to do with... It doesn't have to do with how endowed I am.
[166:52.46]Guys.
[166:53.76]That's not what I'm talking about.
[166:54.72]That's not what we're... That's not the conversation.
[166:56.26]That's a 17 plus stream.
[166:58.10]We're not doing a 17 plus stream.
[167:00.56]Oh, quick.
[167:01.16]Get in the fucking porno library.
[167:02.53]Really?
[167:07.33]The men in black.
[167:08.37]Uh-oh.
[167:10.79]Tommy Lee Jones and fucking Will Smith are gonna show up.
[167:21.21]Give me this.
[167:25.35]Killed that guy twice, that's how bad he died.
[167:29.39]Look at this kid, he can just cheer you on.
[167:46.36]Spammed old titles of Jerma videos.
[167:48.50]I thought that was just the Albus guy for a second.
[167:51.69]There's a guy that enjoys the same clothes as him.
[168:04.84]He's crazy strong.
[168:07.68]How these guys are in the way?
[168:10.10]I just want to go to the batting cages.
[168:12.96]Get away from me.
[168:13.76]Oh, here we go.
[168:24.51]I'm really good at baseball.
[168:31.95]I'm so happy this is in the game.
[168:34.99]How much does it cost?
[168:37.85]300 bucks.
[168:40.86]Intermediate course.
[168:42.34]No, no, no.
[168:43.76]We're going right to the fastest fast pitch.
[168:48.24]When I go to the cages, I don't go to the little slow pitch one.
[168:50.84]I go to the fastest one available and I fucking kill it.
[168:55.26]That one's 5 million yen.
[168:56.50]Okay, never mind.
[169:01.24]Gold rush?
[169:01.90]No, no, no, no.
[169:07.88]Advance course.
[169:08.52]There we go.
[169:15.67]I get to the batting cages and I just hit him out of the park.
[169:17.89]I don't even know how to play it.
[169:21.67]I'm gonna hit every ball in the fucking... I'm gonna hit every single ball correctly.
[169:35.13]Told ya.
[169:39.66]I wanna do it again.
[169:44.02]Again.
[169:48.60]Am I gonna play Knack 2?
[169:50.85]Uh... No.
[169:54.55]Why would I play Knack 2 when I would never play Knack 1?
[170:06.24]Goddammit.
[170:10.16]Goddammit.
[170:15.03]Home run.
[170:35.52]Alright, I got it.
[170:40.73]Failing at this ba- Guys, this is not real baseball.
[170:43.53]See me in the actual batting cages.

[170:53.63]Like, I'll show you guys.
[170:54.63]I'll be in a cage somewhere and I'll be fucking crushing it.
[171:02.63]And everybody can be like, oh wow, he really wasn't kidding.
[171:04.51]He really is like, unbelievable at baseball.
[171:07.71]See me in the cages, guys.
[171:08.99]This is not a real game.
[171:10.29]This is like, press X when the ball comes over here.
[171:22.77]You'll see a Twitter video on you.
[171:24.09]I'm gonna hit like five home runs in a row.
[171:29.69]I'll be in a cage somewhere.
[171:39.84]Oh, what?
[171:40.39]That was a home run.
[171:41.35]What?
[171:45.81]Why are they saying three outs?
[171:52.83]Let's go to the fucking easy one.
[171:54.14]I need to hit the targets.
[172:05.12]At least I'm entertaining myself.
[172:18.85]This is nothing like baseball.
[172:20.29]This is such a, like, a not true to... This is just nothing like baseball at all.
[172:25.03]Stop moving the cursor when I hit the ball?
[172:37.41]I can't help it.
[172:37.91]I'm, like, using my left thumb.
[172:39.51]Just wait till the video comes out of me hitting a fucking, like, 700-foot home run.
[172:55.97]I love how easy is like harder I'm only doing this just to get the 10 out of 10 I'm gonna just hit the ball
[173:35.39]68 miles per hour.
[173:36.11]Give me a break.
[173:47.62]Those balls are coming in so slow.
[173:55.65]Just like... Like what the fuck?
[174:02.30]That's not fun.
[174:03.91]That's not even fun.
[174:05.59]I wish you could punch pedestrians.
[174:06.95]I would punch this guy in the face for fucking looking at me like this.
[174:12.33]See, look.
[174:12.63]He's like Twitch chat.
[174:13.37]He's like chatting.

[174:40.80]Okay, let's go to the convenience store.
[174:47.94]I'm not making fun of you.
[174:48.80]You're making observations.
[174:54.17]Confessing to wanting to assault his viewer base.
[174:56.61]No!
[174:57.01]That was the persona fix- See?
[174:58.73]Stop saying that!
[175:01.81]See?
[175:02.01]You guys are still talking about it.
[175:05.33]That was a personification of a metaphor.
[175:16.01]Quality bait.
[175:17.97]You can go fishing in this game?
[175:23.37]I want to buy a bunch of those healing potions.

[184:49.65]No, I'm like, I was fucking around.
[184:50.95]I was like trying to like curve the ball extremely.
[184:55.13]Now watch, I'm going to kick this girl's ass.
[184:59.77]Here we go.
[185:02.39]I'm gonna fucking destroy this now.
[185:14.41]Yeah, we don't need a cutscene for this.
[185:16.32]Skip it.
[185:33.67]Easy.
[185:34.89]This is an easy spear.
[185:39.21]Go for it.
[185:47.04]Where are you at now, chat?
[185:48.46]Pick up the spare, easily.
[185:50.53]Wait, excuse me, chat.
[185:51.71]Something happened there.
[185:53.09]Somebody did something.
[185:54.43]And look at how impressed she looks.
[186:07.54]She's not going to pick up.
[186:08.12]I'm going to win.
[186:14.64]It's a French horn.
[186:16.96]She's bowling in heels.
[186:17.98]Is she really?
[186:22.83]Yes, she is.
[186:23.37]Why are you bowling in heels?
[186:29.35]She got a strike.
[186:29.95]Oh, phew.
[186:42.29]What's that local streamer who gets a fucking strike on camera?
[186:44.45]I'm about to turn the webcam on and fucking just hold up the middle fingers.
[186:58.52]You're too aggressive.
[187:11.52]Local?
[187:12.16]Yeah, local.
[187:23.95]Dude, Jerma, I said two minutes ago, like, you can't be good at this game.
[187:27.65]No, that's not what I'm saying.
[187:28.68]That's not what I was saying.
[187:31.24]I'm just saying it's real hard to be somebody like me that's real damn good at all this.
[187:37.42]No, no, no, no, no, no, I did it too much.
[187:41.12]I was about to just completely make, like, a dumb joke.
[187:45.72]I went a little too hard there.
[187:47.29]But here's what I was trying to say.
[187:48.37]I was trying to say that, like, let's just fucking get a spare again.
[187:55.41]I said this is just, like, a dumb little minigame.
[187:58.32]And look what happens.
[187:58.94]You guys got in my head again, and we left one fucking, like, stupid pen.
[188:10.29]It's alright.
[188:10.65]She's fucking... She's so stupid.
[188:12.46]She's not gonna get this.
[188:13.20]This is gonna do too much spin.
[188:14.24]It's gonna go overboard.
[188:15.56]We're good.
[188:16.70]That's the one middle finger.
[188:28.99]I'll get a strike right here.
[188:33.57]Last time I went bowling, I got four strikes in a row.
[188:36.31]That's what I got.
[188:40.26]Never done that before in my life.
[188:41.18]I did that, like, two months ago.
[188:43.80]I won.
[188:45.88]So what do I get for winning?
[188:51.01]That's it, nothing.
[188:56.07]Is that just so I can, like, pretend to have a friend?
[189:00.61]Okay, well, that's fine.
[189:13.79]You just get minus 500 yen.
[189:15.33]Apparently.
[189:17.35]Alright.
[189:17.59]What do we want to go next?
[189:19.77]I don't like the side stuff.
[189:22.57]Soba noodles.
[189:23.41]Burger shop.
[189:25.35]Bar.
[189:31.32]Pool and darts.
[189:33.68]Where's karaoke?
[189:39.38]Pop arcade.
[189:40.96]Mahjong.
[189:43.12]Where's they are?
[189:45.10]Oh, it's right now.
[189:45.80]I'm getting in a taxi.
[189:48.02]Let's go in a taxi cab.
[189:49.06]I ain't gonna do this shit.
[189:53.20]I love how this is a taxi look.
[189:59.95]2,000 people watching karaoke.
[190:04.05]Hey, I did like beat a boss though.
[190:06.99]Come on, give me a little bit of credit.
[190:08.49]I did beat a boss.
[190:13.91]Right to the karaoke bar.
[190:14.85]I'm going to nail it.
[190:16.93]And then from there... We want to go... Really?
[190:25.34]Whatever.
[190:29.18]Pancakes or waffles?
[190:30.66]Neither.
[190:31.64]Neither.
[190:31.94]I don't like pancakes or waffles.
[190:41.39]I do like Eggo waffles, though, but I don't think that counts.
[190:44.23]People would be very upset if I said that I liked Eggo waffles more than, like, real waffles.
[190:50.39]No, I don't like cakey shit.
[190:51.74]I don't like cake.
[190:52.88]I don't like pancakes.
[190:55.40]It's too... too much... too heavy for the morning.
[190:59.52]Too heavy, guys.
[191:04.30]They don't taste bad.
[191:05.14]It's not that I don't like them, but they're just too heavy for the morning for me.
[191:10.40]No, I don't want to fight these guys.
[191:12.42]What's with the random Final Fantasy encounters in this game, by the way?
[191:28.85]Can you go away now, please?
[191:30.95]Please go away.
[191:35.23]I'm blocking you.
[191:37.55]That's how you get money to upgrade?
[191:38.69]Yeah, that's true.
[191:40.61]Actually, I can upgrade right now, can't I?
[191:43.74]After we do the karaoke bar.
[191:46.48]Wait, this is not the karaoke bar.
[191:51.70]This is not the karaoke bar.
[191:52.94]I have to meet girls to then watch them on video?
[192:01.31]What?
[192:03.31]Well, we can't go in there, guys.
[192:04.47]We have to meet women first.
[192:15.29]We need to find them to watch their pornos.
[192:20.99]Let's get out of the fucking way.
[192:31.50]Alright.
[192:32.98]Hopefully the, uh, karaoke machines do it.
[192:38.32]Sing solo.
[192:42.54]What song?
[192:43.21]Is it only two songs, or are there more than two?
[192:46.23]It looks like there's a lot.
[193:03.66]Lively interjections.
[193:06.02]Here we go.
[193:11.76]That's not even me.
[193:15.00]Do I have a date now?
[193:16.12]I have no idea what's going on.
[193:30.71]There's nobody singing.
[193:33.01]Is this with the bartender?
[193:36.45]Who is singing this song?
[193:39.84]Oh, okay, okay.
[193:53.69]oh my god I'm just being annoying I'm ruining the song
[194:24.92]What's the over-under?
[194:25.92]A time period where somebody at this bar would turn around and scream, shut the fuck up to this guy.
[194:47.04]Oh fuck I'm missing!
[194:49.24]I don't even think that's the main character.
[194:54.07]Look at this bottom part.
[195:14.71]I got a 90 for that.
[195:15.89]Karaoke king.
[195:16.91]Now get out.
[195:18.13]Wait a minute, I think I have a new girlfriend.
[195:46.09]Aren't you quite the same?
[195:46.83]The customer's like, you brighten up my day.
[195:48.49]Thanks for ruining my whole set.
[195:52.76]Come sing at our bar again.
[195:53.56]You got it.
[195:55.08]You mean like right now?
[195:58.22]How about right now?
[196:08.23]Erotic video time.
[196:16.21]Uh... What should I do?
[196:22.21]Judgment?
[196:26.53]Judgment?
[196:27.27]Should I sing with judgment or should I do lively interjections?
[196:34.42]Why does everybody want this song so much?
[196:41.76]I'm gonna sing it apparently.
[196:51.73]I'm just going to nail all these songs and this girl will talk to me, right?
[196:59.17]Here we go.
[197:00.74]Yeah!
[197:01.30]Yeah!
[197:28.89]My fucking control is broken.
[197:39.64]My X is like not working.
[197:42.29]What a terrible excuse.
[197:59.89]This is way more interesting than the other ones.
[198:11.42]They actually got a music video.
[198:16.92]Okay.
[198:17.16]So I won.
[198:30.53]Turn the in-game sound up.
[198:31.79]90.
[198:31.83]93.
[198:31.89]Okay.
[198:33.15]One more?
[198:35.23]Okay, one more.
[198:44.47]I'm going to interject on this next one.
[198:56.78]Sing them all.
[199:00.93]We're going to do x3 sign lively interjections.
[199:03.45]We'll do simple interjections.
[199:05.89]Simple.
[199:08.27]We don't have to freak out.
[199:12.53]Oi!
[199:13.37]Oi!
[199:14.11]Oi!
[199:15.03]It's just clapping and ois.

[199:21.92]Pua!
[199:22.40]Pua!
[199:29.63]Who let this guy in with a tambourine, by the way?
[199:31.77]Oh yeah, a guy with a fucking tambourine.
[199:38.94]Come on in.
[199:41.88]This would be a lot less awkward if the guy was actually standing up there with a mic in his hand.
[199:59.14]She's gonna like think I'm cool, right?
[200:00.48]I hope so.
[200:01.20]Nobody can clap that fast.
[200:08.44]Holy shit.
[200:12.74]That was so fast.
[200:40.16]That was a clap machine.
[200:41.42]That was not a human being.
[200:42.68]Oh my goodness.
[200:49.27]No, that wasn't that great.
[200:51.15]Nice junk.
[200:52.79]Alright, come on.
[200:55.57]Hey, that was really nice.
[200:56.35]Oh, god damn it.
[200:57.07]Whatever.
[200:58.67]Can I talk to this person?
[201:08.33]Let's drink some fucking oolong tea and a beer.
[201:11.47]Whiskey, let's get some pickles in there, some fried chicken.
[201:19.56]Mm-hmm.
[201:21.80]Nice.
[201:22.18]Do it again.
[201:25.00]One more round.
[201:29.20]I can't.
[201:31.18]Alright, now should I do it drunk?
[201:37.75]Should I do karaoke drunk?
[201:38.69]Does that change anything?
[201:39.39]Alright, let's go to the bar.
[201:46.01]Let's go to, like, the club.
[201:55.11]What the fuck?
[201:55.99]Okay, um... This is the erotic video place.
[202:03.12]Bar with pool and darts.
[202:09.82]Let's go to the other bar.
[202:12.72]Yeah, let's go up here.
[202:15.32]Look for side quests.
[202:19.24]They're kind of just random little spots.
[202:21.64]Should I just go down here and look for a side quest?
[202:24.78]This is a side area.
[202:29.89]I hear something down here.
[202:32.19]Yep, side quest.
[202:33.11]Intervene.
[202:43.51]Fight the goons.
[202:44.71]I think I just punched the guy I was supposed to help.
[202:59.52]Yeah, I blasted the guy that I was supposed to help, I think.
[203:01.62]Ruby plate.
[203:08.54]Okay.
[203:11.93]Just send this to the... Send the... I don't care.
[203:15.84]Alright, nice side quest.
[203:18.74]Alright, I'm gonna... Let's see.
[203:24.08]Right here.
[203:26.10]Let's go to this little restaurant for a second.
[203:32.37]No, fuck the restaurant.
[203:33.89]No, no men in black either.
[203:36.22]Oh, come on.
[203:38.10]This guy's lung capacity is that of like a small pig.
[203:41.32]Oh my god.
[204:03.47]Why a pig?
[204:03.99]I don't know.
[204:05.63]Small pigs are little.
[204:06.71]They're easy to think about.
[204:10.59]Let's go to the other bar.
[204:13.29]Wait.
[204:13.71]Hello?
[204:14.05]Excuse me?
[204:15.43]Hello?
[204:17.61]Nobody talks to you in this game?
[204:20.13]Apparently not.
[204:22.17]Can't go in that way.
[204:24.23]Here it is.
[204:24.57]Let's do it.
[204:28.97]Easy to think about.
[204:32.37]Well, I'm sorry about that.
[204:33.49]It's a little more than a third.
[204:34.43]$15 is like 70 or 80%.
[204:56.16]Maybe two thirds.
[204:57.76]Maybe.
[204:58.18]Yeah.
[204:58.64]Yeah.
[204:59.22]Thanks, Jabba Sneeze.
[204:59.90]Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[205:01.32]Uh, Zoodies, thanks for the $10, should sing along the words that are on the screen no fucking way.
[205:07.18]Not a chance.
[205:10.13]I'm not gonna sing along on, but no.
[205:13.03]Who are you?
[205:16.09]I play pool with the random staff.
[205:17.73]$800 a game, sure.
[205:19.65]I love how...
[205:26.37]What are you talking about, NAMF?
[205:29.17]A third of $20 is not $15.
[205:31.37]It's like $6.
[205:33.95]It's like $7.
[205:35.65]It's like $6.5.
[205:37.63]What are you guys talking about?
[206:00.66]What are you talking about?
[206:02.64]This is some very awkward eye contact.
[206:04.44]I just gave him 500,000 yen.
[206:19.00]Hopefully this works.
[206:19.96]I have to select easy.
[206:20.60]I promise.
[206:30.27]What did I do?
[206:33.77]I don't know what I did.
[206:38.22]Yeah, I know how to play pool.
[206:42.92]I know how to play pool.
[206:51.26]That's fine.
[206:56.81]I'm gonna get 3.6 million.
[207:04.18]Get to the erotic vids already.
[207:06.16]Jesus.
[207:08.56]The patience on that guy.
[207:20.45]Alright.
[207:23.37]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[207:24.33]I should not have bet that much money when it's like Wii style.
[207:26.65]This is bringing back to Wii.
[207:31.97]This got way more elaborate.
[207:33.80]Is this... Seriously, is this game just these elaborate minigames?
[207:39.48]Alright, what do I need to do?
[207:40.82]What does it want me to do?
[207:41.44]8-ball.
[207:43.13]Corner pocket.
[207:47.75]I don't really know what it wants me to do here.
[208:07.26]That scared the shit out of me.
[208:19.85]Hit it!
[208:20.71]What is going on?
[208:25.17]What the fuck?

[208:29.51]Oh my fucking god.
[208:37.39]Why?
[208:38.75]What?
[208:47.20]Wrong ball.
[208:48.54]Why did that?
[208:49.14]Look at that.
[208:49.54]Perfect fucking shot.
[208:51.91]I'm so good at this.
[208:59.53]I just got the red ball in.
[209:01.69]What are you talking about?
[209:05.89]Red one everybody just says red ball dumbass red ball red ball dumbass I don't understand.

[209:41.22]This is not easy.
[209:44.94]Next stage.
[210:25.85]Shit!
[210:26.87]No!
[210:28.49]That's it, I'm outta here.
[210:46.26]Ah!

[210:56.72]We're fine.
[211:02.78]We're fine.
[211:04.11]There's Yakuza... Ah, I lost a lot.
[211:05.71]Yeah, it's alright.
[211:15.49]Well, there's Yakuza, everybody.
[211:17.91]Thank you for watching.
[211:21.53]I'm actually... I'm gonna do a poll.
[211:23.51]Literally right now.
[211:25.82]Literally right now.
[211:28.34]Here's what we're going to do.
[211:32.70]If you'd like to stick around for a moment.
[211:36.25]Got to do a poll.
[211:37.79]Because I'm curious.
[211:39.91]From what you've seen so far.
[211:41.33]Do you want me to continue to play Yakuza 0?
[211:48.55]Here are your choices.
[211:51.25]This is what we'll be doing on Thursday by the way.
[211:53.09]Because there's a couple options here.
[212:07.74]Here you go.
[212:14.50]And when I put the list here, this is not fair.
[212:21.00]I know it's going to win.
[212:23.16]I just want to know how many people really want to see that.
[212:27.86]So here you go.
[212:30.52]Like, by the way, FMV games are, like, full motion video, like, stupid shitty video, like, in real life dumb, like, Windows 98 games.
[212:43.01]I know it's gonna win.
[212:43.91]Like, I'm nearly, I'm almost certain of that.
[212:50.13]But, okay, I just lost connection to chat.
[212:55.56]Can you guys see what I'm writing here?
[212:58.67]Apparently I lost connection to chat.
[213:00.13]Maybe you... Okay, there we go.
[213:02.34]Like, do you want... What do you want to do on Thursday?
[213:05.30]Because I'm open to play this some more.
[213:09.54]I'm open to play this.
[213:10.34]I'm open to play Until Dawn.
[213:11.44]Or I'm open to do a couple of full motion video games that I have.
[213:17.33]I'm saving the game.
[213:17.97]Don't worry.
[213:18.65]I will save the game.
[213:26.40]And wow, I'm surprised that Yakuza is winning.
[213:33.88]By a lot, actually.
[213:36.36]Until Dawn might need an entire week.
[213:39.27]Maybe.
[213:41.07]Well, if you guys really want, if you guys want like a batting cage stream, like we can do this again on Thursday.
[213:44.63]Is this like Dino week?
[213:53.23]No.
[213:59.80]Yakuza is a fun game.
[214:01.02]And I am enjoying Yakuza.
[214:04.00]But I just was curious.
[214:05.14]I think we're like into the game now, right?
[214:08.50]We'll see.
[214:13.55]Maybe we could start with this on Thursday.
[214:19.23]Maybe we'll start with Until Dawn is not winning.
[214:22.61]Maybe we'll start with some FMV games and then move on to Yakuza.
[214:26.07]Or maybe I'll do FMV games on Friday.
[214:27.99]I don't know.
[214:36.56]Right at the part where it opens up.
