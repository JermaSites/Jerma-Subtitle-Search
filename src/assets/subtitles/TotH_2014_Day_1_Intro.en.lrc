[ve:61.1.100]

[00:06.41]What's up everybody?
[00:07.63]We're finally live.
[00:09.78]Chat all riled up.
[00:11.46]We're ready to go.
[00:12.14]It's tip of the hats.
[00:14.21]Part two, the second rendition.
[00:16.67]Welcome.
[00:17.17]Thank you so much.
[00:17.95]3,000 people already.
[00:19.50]My god, nerds.
[00:20.58]I love you.
[00:21.82]I am Seabear and it's my pleasure to be kicking this off here with
[00:25.97]like 27 of my best friends here in Mumble.
[00:29.47]I don't want to do the casting introduction of every single one of them, so I guess we'll just sort of pass the baton around.
[00:36.10]For this first hour, we're going to watch a couple young men you might have heard of from their YouTube channel.
[00:42.88]Mr. Star, also known as Ruin, and then Jerma.
[00:46.52]They're going to be pubbing, looks like, Upward.
[00:49.39]My eyes don't deceive me, and that's going to be pretty awesome.
[00:52.42]I have a little bet out with Star.
[00:54.06]We'll talk about that in a little bit.
[00:55.20]But let's let the other casters here with me introduce themselves.
[00:58.65]Let's start.
[00:59.23]Let's just go alphabetically here.
[01:01.33]Mr. Admirable, and then we'll just go through the list.
[01:03.76]So, Big Admirable, how's it going, buddy?
[01:07.11]Oh man, I've been preparing myself mentally all day for this.
[01:11.19]You know, it's the token European here.
[01:13.56]A lot of weight rests on my shoulders.
[01:15.10]We're going to have some NA versus EU show matches over the next two days.
[01:19.63]And I think I really have to deliver for Europe, you know.
[01:24.71]But... You're not playing, are you?
[01:28.64]No, no.
[01:29.92]I'm horribly bad at this game.
[01:30.98]I don't really compete anymore.
[01:32.06]I play a little bit of Highlander, but... I'll leave that to the pros, man.
[01:37.43]We just have a really good cast.
[01:39.32]And that's coming up next.
[01:40.44]That's in like 58 minutes.
[01:43.17]That's our first sort of event.
[01:45.11]And that's going to be a couple hours of good old Highlander action.
[01:47.59]Sure, that will be fun.
[01:49.58]Also, we have the Blutham boy, Mr. Bloodsire.
[01:51.56]What's going on?
[01:52.61]Hey, what's up?
[01:53.91]Not much is going on.
[01:54.87]I'm very happy to be here for this awesome, awesome event.
[01:58.48]you know last year was a huge success uh we're kicking it off the second tip of the hats and it's just a great cause and it's a great event I'm happy that uh Sean bud and lang chuck chuck whiskey all those guys were able to get together again this time we're bigger uh I don't know if I want to say better but I'll say better we're bigger and better and I'm excited to be a part of it it's gonna be it's gonna be a good two days it's like the good bad like we're bad in the bone this year we're gonna need some money we're bad
[02:23.28]Well, the stream looks awesome.
[02:25.23]I gotta say the HUD looks sweet that you are watching at the bottom.
[02:29.05]For you guys who don't know, you guys and girls, Lang and TruckTruck are together in, I guess, TruckTruck's house in upstate New York doing the double-headed presentation.
[02:40.33]I think actually that Mabla is there, your favorite guy there, Justin.
[02:44.96]Mabla is there.
[02:45.78]helping out, so maybe a three-headed casting monster, presenting monster, streaming monster, so big shout out to them, especially to Lang for traveling for the event.
[02:56.45]But now let's get to the players who are currently dominating.
[02:59.63]How do I ever introduce
[03:02.08]Men such as these, so famous, I should get their autographs.
[03:06.16]Star is market gardening for cancer right now, or to defeat cancer, I should say.
[03:11.29]He's not on cancer's side.
[03:12.61]Every time he gets a Market Gardener kill, I'm donating $1.
[03:15.29]So if someone's going to have to help me keep track of that, I don't know.
[03:18.13]It's not going so well right now.
[03:19.74]You have zero right now, I want to say, which is good because I just got into the server.
[03:22.72]There is one.
[03:23.48]He was AFK.
[03:26.06]I'll do 50 cents for that.
[03:27.28]That counts, though, because you can miss.
[03:29.99]Oh, that's a kill, man.
[03:31.23]You can change the rules after the bet.
[03:34.24]That's a dollar.
[03:35.20]Yeah, you're right.
[03:36.58]I was planning on donating quite a bit, so I think that's fine.
[03:39.65]I'm just worried because Star's the best, so you never know.
[03:42.01]He might go crazy, get like 600 of them.
[03:45.32]But when everyone on the server wants you dead, it gets a little bit harder.
[03:49.53]Yeah, we were talking about that.
[03:50.49]When Stabby Stabby comes in for his pub session, you know, he's a spy.
[03:54.67]He's gonna be running around and navigating the old, you know, 11 Pyros on the other team just looking for him.
[04:00.60]11 good Pyros, like they know how to play and stuff, this would be pretty awesome.
[04:03.85]And then last but not least, also in the server we have Jerma, whose mic is always down, so you'll be hearing his clicking in the background, which is absolutely fine.
[04:13.46]I will fix that.
[04:15.02]That's cool.
[04:15.60]If it was me, you'd hear me, like, breathing horribly into the microphone, like, like all amped up and flat.
[04:24.37]Oh, shh.
[04:24.55]I didn't think you'd know.
[04:26.45]Hi.
[04:26.73]I'm watching the StarCamp.
[04:28.61]M2.
[04:29.50]Gotta keep track, so I don't know if... I guess it's my job.
[04:32.19]Or Star, you can... I'll trust that you... I'll keep a tally.
[04:36.28]I'll, like, etch it into my skin every time I get one.
[04:39.70]And for you guys, I haven't said anything about this yet.
[04:43.26]If you have any information, if you want any information on what's happening today and when, tipofthehats.org.
[04:49.99]Also, if you feel like being awesome, tipofthehats.com will redirect you to the website that says everything about everything as far as what's going on today and tomorrow.
[04:58.84]This is a two-day event.
[05:00.30]We have all sorts of awesome plans and events scheduled.
[05:04.95]So go there.
[05:06.46]Also, easy to donate, I'm told.
[05:09.47]At the top of that screen, at tipofthehats.com, the stream is embedded, and then there's a donation link.
[05:15.31]Pretty straightforward.
[05:16.16]I will be doing that after this hour ends, donating a certain amount of money based on how good Star is.
[05:21.92]At least $1 so far.
[05:22.62]We got one.
[05:23.89]Yeah, it's the AFK.
[05:26.37]You don't seem impressed.
[05:27.47]It was a really good one.
[05:29.39]Isn't this your favorite map, though?
[05:30.43]Because you like to do all the crazy jumps on the slopes.
[05:33.84]Dude, it is.
[05:35.60]It's the best map in the video game, but it's just not going well.
[05:40.19]I kind of want to throw Jerma into this competition here, because it's like, why would I only let Star?
[05:44.57]That's not fair.
[05:45.11]You want me to try to market garden somebody?
[05:47.52]No, you're playing the Demoman, so maybe we do some kind of caber shenanigans or something.
[05:55.13]I don't know.
[05:56.05]I'll go for it.
[05:56.87]But yeah, if you're going to give me to market garden somebody, I think I've only done like two in my life.
[06:02.08]Yeah.
[06:02.76]Ozzy is in there going absolutely crazy with Ubisoft.
[06:06.18]Of course Ozzy, one of the helpers here in the pub.
[06:09.25]I'm not sure, this is our actual tip of the hats pub as well I want to say.
[06:12.65]So a lot of these people are friends of the community, maybe some randoms, but I see some familiar names.
[06:19.70]Maybe I should begin the donation arms race here Seabear.
[06:22.70]If you're going to give one dollar for every time Star gets a Market Garden kill, I could give two for every time Juma gets one.
[06:29.69]You're going to want to give like 50.
[06:31.62]You know, if Jerma gets a Market Gardener kill, like an actual crit, I'll donate 100.
[06:38.40]Okay.
[06:39.27]Wow.
[06:40.09]Wow.
[06:40.69]There we go.
[06:42.31]Okay.
[06:42.45]We'll do that.
[06:43.05]Jermacom.
[06:43.71]Jermacom.
[06:44.39]I need shit proof.
[06:46.20]Like this has to be recorded as well.
[06:48.02]Like from your perspective so we can get our referees to like look at him.
[06:51.40]Like, oh yeah, that was a crit.
[06:54.05]Yeah.
[06:55.03]Alright.
[06:55.57]Now you just gave me so much incentive to do this.
[07:00.13]That's good.
[07:01.06]He's got the right loadout for it, I gotta say.
[07:03.64]That's going to be pretty awesome.
[07:04.74]I think we should all try to match it there, but I'll... Jerm, if you get one too... I'm not big money star, because I'm also donating for him, but I'll throw a 50 in there.
[07:13.31]You get it?
[07:13.91]Oh, man.
[07:14.53]Rigic crits a 150, and Abravol's is basically made of money.
[07:18.17]He's the bank.
[07:18.79]So he has to get one for 100.
[07:21.24]One for 150, and then I guess 152, because you're... I'm in for 100.
[07:29.75]Let's do it.
[07:30.45]I might starve.
[07:31.87]If he gets one before I do as well, I think I'm just done.
[07:34.92]We're just going to set it up right now.
[07:37.18]It has to be in non-manufactured.
[07:40.26]I don't want to see some guy just stop in there and you jump in.
[07:43.35]We don't need you saying, oh, blue team, line up for me real quick.
[07:46.95]I've got to say, this is the best chance to get one here.
[07:49.41]You're switched to defense.
[07:53.34]Map switching.
[07:54.42]Oh, the map is actually switching.
[07:56.44]Everything is against us.
[07:58.98]Bloodsire, you're the analyst of the bunch.
[08:01.80]What is the best map in TF2 for market gardening?
[08:07.29]If you had to pick one.
[08:08.58]DM mod?
[08:11.06]No, I don't know.
[08:11.98]I would imagine Upward would have been pretty good because you have a lot of people coming in one direction towards you.
[08:16.22]um you know things slope up so if you're on defense like you said you can just jump at them but we're going to um borneo borneo borneo it's the first moment of this uh this caster I actually don't know what's like this map this map is played in highlander I think it was just recently played like two weeks ago in plat well I guess all the divisions
[08:37.32]They made a lot of weird, weird changes to it.
[08:39.72]I remember they did it a long time ago, like three or four seasons back.
[08:43.84]Yeah, it's a pretty map.
[08:45.05]I'll give it that.
[08:46.57]Nice tile set.
[08:48.21]Looking around, looks like a lot of corridors, some open areas.
[08:51.87]I think, Jeremy, you got a chance here.
[08:53.09]$250 at least for a single Market Gardener, which would raise our total donation to almost $11,000.
[08:59.42]$10,500 already donated.
[09:03.58]You guys and gals are awesome.
[09:05.93]What?
[09:06.01]I want to say that's one-fourth somewhere in that area of what we raised all of last year.
[09:12.82]Ten grand already.
[09:14.50]Ten grand already.
[09:15.36]You guys are the best.
[09:17.16]That's crazy, yeah.
[09:18.41]It is crazy.
[09:19.29]And to think, $250 is riding on you being able to play a game.
[09:23.75]I don't think you can do it.
[09:24.94]I don't think you can play a game.
[09:26.12]I'm going to do it.
[09:26.94]I'm going to do it.
[09:28.06]And for I think there's information about the charity on the site while we're in warm-up or setup time here I'll drop a little information I was hoping we'd get somebody from the one-step camp on to talk somebody we do have somebody coming over here and
[09:43.45]Alex from Ryan Follows.
[09:44.99]Yeah, okay, that's awesome.
[09:46.34]So the One Step Camp is a Midwest-based, but I think they're stretching out because they've gotten so much money raised in the last couple years, that send kids with cancer and leukemia to summer camp.
[10:01.10]And it's not like a research and prevention site or site of charity, but it's basically to help the kids that already have the inflection disease, help them feel normal.
[10:13.16]And I've worked with them and gone to a couple of the events in Chicago, which is where they're based out of.
[10:18.37]And I got to say, it's an awesome cause.
[10:20.30]No, you're lagging.
[10:21.44]Sorry.
[10:22.28]It's fine.
[10:23.44]I am also lagging.
[10:26.11]So yeah, it's a great cause.
[10:28.47]I'll get some exact numbers here.
[10:30.07]That's one, so that's $1.
[10:31.55]$2 out of the old wallet here.
[10:34.12]I'll get some more information about where exactly the money is going to, but unlike these huge charities, basically 99% of all the money donated goes straight to the cause, so it's a great cause.
[10:45.55]Justin did it!
[10:48.19]What the man?!
[10:48.45]!
[10:49.47]I missed it too.
[10:51.91]There's proof.
[10:52.77]There's legit proof that it happened.
[10:54.65]I was watching it.
[10:55.57]I was clicking through and I just saw it happen.
[10:57.80]I was on strictly Jerma cam and I have to, uh, I have to buy for that.
[11:00.66]That is legit.
[11:02.00]That was a nice kill.
[11:03.78]Hold on, let me blow the cobwebs out of my wallet.
[11:05.77]Oh, I just opened the stream and it's like just after we got it.
[11:08.85]I missed it.
[11:09.43]So I'm gonna, I'm gonna need the referee on that.
[11:11.39]No, it's legit.
[11:13.60]Well, once we're done playing here, I'll donate the hundred.
[11:18.24]I got 50, so that's 250.
[11:21.66]Jerma doing his part.
[11:23.14]I don't even believe it.
[11:27.83]My only question is, was there some cahoots with the enemy player?
[11:33.81]Was it like that person watching the stream?
[11:35.51]It's like, well, I'm just going to stand here.
[11:37.23]I see the guy coming out there.
[11:38.50]I saw some life.
[11:39.66]I saw some movement.
[11:40.42]There was movement in me.
[11:42.80]There was movement there.
[11:43.94]Yeah, he had a keyboard.
[11:44.98]He definitely had his fingers around the keys.
[11:48.49]What it must feel like to be that guy, though.
[11:51.96]I'm so sorry.
[11:53.90]Hey, it must be pretty good.
[11:54.89]You just were the reason why 250 bucks just got donated.
[12:00.02]We should do another pool of $25 each if someone kills Star with the Wrangler.
[12:06.26]What's the one that you hate the most?
[12:07.85]Is it the mini-century gun thing?
[12:10.13]Oh, don't make that a vote.
[12:11.67]You owe $3.
[12:12.89]$3.
[12:13.43]I'm going to wait to do my donation until after this nonsense is over since we do have another 50 minutes of fun here.
[12:22.72]You probably flipped.
[12:24.12]Oh, there's $4.
[12:24.78]Oh, another one.
[12:25.84]Oh my goodness.
[12:26.56]This is the map of pain for my wallet.
[12:30.89]That sniper just totally wrecked me right there.
[12:34.31]You're getting ready to jump and you just...
[12:37.28]got dealt with.
[12:38.98]I should probably switch to the, uh, the jumper.
[12:42.95]You're only going for the Murphy Gardner because it was awesome.
[12:47.49]So if I get another one, does that mean another $250?
[12:49.56]Yes!
[12:50.26]Well, for admirable, I think it's going to go $100.
[12:52.70]What?!
[12:54.64]Pretty sure that's what he said.
[12:58.53]You'll have to contact my lawyer if you want to get that money out of my cool dead ass.
[13:01.83]Was it last tip of the hat where you did the twir thing?
[13:04.82]That didn't count, I saw it.
[13:08.14]I think all of my kills have been on the same guy.
[13:12.01]You guys should be on the opposite team and do like a mid-air shovel attack thing.
[13:17.51]There's the Mini-Sentry.
[13:19.42]You're just making it harder on me.
[13:21.00]I feel like I'm embarrassing myself with these rocket jump attempts.
[13:26.02]How many people are in the stream right now?
[13:28.06]We have 4,500 people watching you do the best.
[13:31.06]Can I interject for a moment, friends?
[13:32.90]Yeah, go ahead.
[13:34.06]Muselk, I don't know if you guys announced this already, just donated $790.
[13:36.35]That is the product of his Market Gardener, his community Market Gardener video project that he's been doing for the last week.
[13:42.95]Nice.
[13:43.74]We're going to debut that on the stream at some point either today or tomorrow.
[13:48.02]Roger that, Ghost Rider.
[13:50.28]Very cool.
[13:50.64]I was actually just about to mention that.
[13:52.04]And that is really cool.
[13:54.32]$790.
[13:54.74]It's a large donation.
[13:56.06]Thank you.
[13:57.00]Oh, Ozzy.
[13:57.75]Ozzy is the savior.
[13:59.93]Yeah, which puts our total donation total, without us giving our $250, it's just scrolling right now.
[14:06.44]Viridian, $30.
[14:07.92]Clannanana, $50.
[14:09.88]A big Anonymous with a $5.
[14:11.83]Unbelievable.
[14:12.53]That's over $11,000.
[14:14.33]We're trending towards...
[14:16.03]twelve thousand right now which is awesome actually we're basically there so things are looking great here tip of the hats to let's break our record from last year I want to get an exact number on what that was I want to say 46 but that might be completely wrong I think it was 35 000. it was only I thought it was more it was 35 36 issues somewhere around there oh okay only only well that's that's enough I'll take that to the bank
[14:43.69]I'm pretty confident that number's going down this year.
[14:48.17]I'm not sure who you were just on right there, but that was, like, totally embarrassing.
[14:52.80]We've got to the part of the map where it's just, like, a tunnel.
[14:56.82]I'm not going to market guard someone in the tunnel.
[14:58.76]I got out of the tunnel, and there's many sentries.
[15:01.89]I just tried to, like, jump up in that little corridor at the top, and I, like, missed the jump, like, four times.
[15:08.95]I've seen Shamba do that.
[15:12.48]Shamba's the best.
[15:14.59]Coming up next is Highlander at the top of the next hour.
[15:17.89]I believe that's 1 o'clock Eastern or noon if you live in civilized world.
[15:23.12]And that's going to be admirable and salamancer.
[15:26.29]My buddy Sal and my other buddy admirable casting that bad boy.
[15:29.91]And that is going to be, do we know the teams are admirable?
[15:32.21]Yeah man, it's going to be a high pander represented in Europe.
[15:36.26]That's Hildreth's team.
[15:37.74]They won the EFTL season last time around, I believe.
[15:42.87]Maybe I just got that totally wrong.
[15:44.14]But they're going to be playing against Electric Temptations, a team who've signed up
[15:49.27]to ETFTL's most recent season with Highlander to defend American Honor and seem to be sucking out at the minute.
[15:54.80]So they're here.
[15:55.26]They're going to be playing on a New York server and maybe they can actually demonstrate how good they are against these EU teams.
[16:00.70]You know, it's the EU-NA rivalry.
[16:02.00]It's going to be big.
[16:03.51]I know that the sixes thing has gone basically whoever's playing on the home server.
[16:08.30]I think that we've had one team win on the laggier side of it in 6v6.
[16:14.13]How has the Highlander gone over the years?
[16:15.99]Has there been a team that's been better or a side or a country, I guess, that's been better?
[16:23.02]Or a continent, I should say?
[16:25.26]I think generally, even though the Europeans hate it, New York ends up as the server because the variance of pings across the great continent of North America that you inhabit is too big, so usually the North American teams get that advantage and then the Europeans bitch about it afterwards when they lose.
[16:42.79]That's generally the run of things.
[16:45.07]I've just got a message from Gettawhale here as well.
[16:47.10]He says that Electric Temptation are not going to be the North American side.
[16:50.14]The players are to be announced.
[16:52.00]So definitely going to be an easy win for Europe here.
[16:54.95]We're going to roll you guys.
[16:57.89]There's another.
[16:59.98]Charity.
[17:01.26]Money.
[17:03.88]Scream charity at Braveheart when you kill somebody.
[17:07.11]I think we need a cash register sign or something.
[17:10.26]No, I'm throwing so hard.
[17:12.38]The thing is, I never play this map, so I'm just kind of wandering around aimlessly.
[17:19.13]I've turned around like three times and been going the wrong direction.
[17:22.68]Oh yeah, that's... Have I ever played this game?
[17:24.92]What is this?
[17:26.96]Don't worry, man.
[17:27.66]That's why I'm not playing in anything.
[17:30.20]I'll just run around, like, not knowing how to get my spawns.
[17:32.03]Seagrave has no idea what he's looking at.
[17:33.25]Dude, I have no idea.
[17:34.03]We were, Justin and, er, Bloodsire and I were talking about it yesterday.
[17:36.77]We do a little warm-up, because we're playing in the randomizer later, and I don't want to be completely terrible.
[17:40.90]And Star's actually getting an uber right now.
[17:43.48]Look at this.
[17:43.85]I'm not going to do anything with it.
[17:45.61]You got that one guy, though.
[17:47.90]You did what, watching the spy just chase that guy around?
[17:52.08]We're talking about how many different things I'm going to see that I don't know, and then I'm going to say something like, what's that?
[17:57.59]And then everyone in chat is going to make fun of me for being dumb.
[18:01.41]It happened ten minutes in.
[18:03.24]I just didn't know the map.
[18:05.42]The tree.
[18:06.48]This tree hitbox, man.
[18:08.16]Nothing is working with me.
[18:09.98]I actually had the pleasure of playing this map.
[18:11.63]I rang for a Highlander team on this map, but I had no idea where I was either, so I feel your pain.
[18:21.48]Are you getting arrested?
[18:23.40]It's not me.
[18:25.12]What?
[18:25.55]It's the sound of the police.
[18:28.43]You're still being me, but it's not me.
[18:32.32]I'm coming to arrest him off his boat.
[18:34.20]Or whatever.
[18:35.66]Oh, that was a stab.
[18:40.33]Star, you're making a real dog's dinner of this attempt to kill this sniper even with the fully charged.
[18:44.61]What the hell is going on?
[18:45.61]He's going under ceilings and stuff.
[18:47.36]He's cheating.
[18:47.74]There he goes.
[18:48.78]There we go.
[18:49.98]He just barely missed it.
[18:51.58]I saw that, Lar.
[18:52.82]I saw that.
[18:53.34]Oh, he gets air shot at.
[18:56.35]Look at all the people showing up to kill me.
[18:59.63]Yeah, but if you're going to die, Zero let you die in style.
[19:02.41]That was awesome.
[19:04.33]That's true.
[19:04.65]That's a nice shot.
[19:06.99]I'll tell you who died in style, that guy who let Jerma market garden him for 250 bucks.
[19:13.60]I wasn't joking about that donations arms race either, you know last year whenever Shipwizard got involved there was a lot of high rollers around that loved to break out those wallets man.
[19:23.63]um update while we've been blathering on and that star has been failing we've gotten another thousand dollars basically we're up to twelve seven out of five hundred I hit someone he cratered no he didn't crater does it count questionable no you gotta get the crit I gotta see it was a crit but I gotta see it on the kill feed because I'm looking at chat
[19:44.44]Chat, if you guys have questions for our panel, Star, Jerma, Admirable, Bloodsire, me, go ahead and ask them.
[19:56.10]Anyone?
[19:57.14]About anything?
[19:57.82]Go ahead.
[19:58.49]I know that chat's trending a little awesome so far today.
[20:02.17]5, or no, that's 6.
[20:04.86]6 or 5.
[20:05.68]That's a thing you can do basically the whole time.
[20:07.18]You may not be able to get to everybody, as you see there's quite a few people here, but we'll do our best, especially in the DJ Wheat, mini-wheat section.
[20:13.73]I'm looking to you, Chet, to help me.
[20:16.25]Questions for DJ Wheat and his kid?
[20:17.91]Mostly DJ Wheat.
[20:18.61]I don't know how, like, mid-mini-wheat's like 8, but I mean, I'm sure he'll be eloquent enough to answer some questions.
[20:27.74]That is an adorable little wheat.
[20:32.04]Apparently El Churro, also in chat, now we have no way of making this guy donate other than shaming him publicly, but apparently that guy said 500 for Jerma if he got the Market Gardener kill.
[20:43.97]So I don't know if I can confirm or deny that would put that over one of the most expensive single kills in the history of TF2.
[20:50.38]Oh my god, that would have been so cool, but unfortunately it wasn't.
[20:55.61]So I don't know if El Churro or whatever...
[21:01.72]A lot of troll questions.
[21:02.83]They want to know about your nipples, Jerma.
[21:06.05]Caused a nipple twister?
[21:07.37]I think that's different.
[21:08.91]That's normal.
[21:09.43]That's a pretty normal day in the questions.
[21:15.20]You're just going to not tell us?
[21:17.42]Yeah, how are they?
[21:19.40]They're okay.
[21:20.24]They're alright.
[21:22.05]No, don't burn me out.
[21:24.79]Someone that I can't read their name, the one opening Star Wars, your favorite video that you've ever made.
[21:30.75]favorite video I actually answered something similar to that in the AMA I was doing on the reddits before this it's not exactly my favorite it's not like the best but I feel like my Far Cry 3 video that I made was like the beginning of an era so I always look at that one and I was like oh I really like that one while we have a little bit of downtime I want to give a shout out
[21:58.63]to Azel, who fronted the $400 so we could have that merch raffle with the mechanical keyboards.
[22:04.71]And also Twitch John, of course, who donated those 20 Twitch t-shirts, which are kind of a high commodity.
[22:10.26]Yeah, those are awesome.
[22:11.46]Thanks to those guys, Azel and John, for doing that for us.
[22:15.63]My question about the shirts are, is it all one color?
[22:18.03]Because I've only seen the Twitch shirt in the Twitch gray.
[22:21.65]I have one in the Twitch gray.
[22:24.02]Oh, you have one, huh?
[22:25.86]Yeah.
[22:26.89]Twitch John sent you a full computer and he didn't send you a t-shirt because he sent me one.
[22:32.16]Nah, I got the computer, I didn't get the t-shirt.
[22:35.90]He probably gave this guy enough, jeez.
[22:40.21]I don't know about the coloring.
[22:41.51]That would be cool if they were multiple colors, but it would also be cool if they're not.
[22:44.31]Yeah, they're awesome shirts.
[22:45.98]Whenever I wear the t-shirt out in public, people always come up to me and ask me about, hey, you know Twitch?
[22:50.10]Like, you know, the people in the know.
[22:53.17]People always, where are they coming up to you?
[22:55.87]Oh my god, Angel's heating me up.
[22:57.85]You know, if I'm out in public, or I get it a lot when I go to speech tournaments around a speech coach here, and one of the other kids will come up.
[23:05.14]Just a slightly younger generation.
[23:06.84]Seven?
[23:08.02]Seven dollars.
[23:09.34]I thought there'd be more stars.
[23:11.28]I didn't think so.
[23:12.58]That's why I said like a dollar.
[23:14.27]What a cheapo.
[23:16.23]I love how I went medic.
[23:17.33]I went medic with zero seconds left.
[23:19.59]That was a good idea.
[23:20.45]It's a team player.
[23:21.51]Overtime, man.
[23:23.88]Nope, nope.
[23:24.92]Gone.
[23:27.83]You know, I have faith.
[23:28.59]Offense, I'm gonna get 16 in my first life before I even take one point of damage.
[23:35.08]It includes self-damage from Rocket Jump.
[23:38.15]Big Sizer in the chat modding.
[23:41.57]He wants to know what your opinion on Brown Sugar is, Star.
[23:44.76]He actually asked that.
[23:46.61]I don't doubt that he did, because he spent, I don't know, an hour sending me pictures of brown sugar the other day.
[23:52.94]Just, like, indifferent.
[23:54.92]I heard it's 98% sugar.
[23:57.06]Oh, he sent me all the facts about it, all the statistics, like, health, nutrients, everything.
[24:02.61]I'm, like, well-informed on brown sugar right now.
[24:06.53]Samzi, S-A-E-M-Z-I, Admirable, wants to tell you that he'll give $10 to the cause if you give him a shout-out.
[24:16.31]I'd like to shout out Samzy Derulo.
[24:19.74]That's his full name.
[24:21.26]President Jason Derulo.
[24:22.22]Shout out to Samzy.
[24:23.72]Get your wallet out, buddy.
[24:25.13]You need your money now.
[24:26.17]That was so good, you might have to give more than ten.
[24:29.11]Just throwing it out there, Samzy.
[24:33.16]Timo Support.
[24:35.14]apparently said, I'm not kidding, I WILL, all caps for WILL, donate $1,000 if Star shows his face.
[24:44.13]Now, we've had Star on various functions where he's shown his face.
[24:48.80]If I link you to a video of Star's face, will you still give $1,000 Teemo support?
[24:53.34]There are various functions.
[24:55.14]Or does this have to be some kind of live thing, full screen of Star's face?
[24:59.49]Because I don't know if we can do that.
[25:01.11]$1,000 is all I'll do for you, pretty much anything.
[25:02.61]I'll do a song and dance for you.
[25:06.77]Oh, we're in a bad spot here, pesky.
[25:15.39]This is like the most intense TF2 ever.
[25:17.76]The team you're not on is really good.
[25:21.00]Yeah.
[25:21.92]They don't want me dead.
[25:24.24]Well, both teams are great.
[25:25.88]Both teams are fantastic.
[25:27.13]Everyone's good.
[25:28.49]It's a little better than the pub that Bloodsire and I were in last night that was like half Russian.
[25:34.15]Like, in an American server, didn't know what was going on.
[25:36.44]That was really bizarre.
[25:37.56]It was like bots, but not... Yeah, this guy wants to get in shape so it's not terrible on the randomizer, so he picks a server.
[25:42.83]It's like a Russian server.
[25:43.87]Everyone's got like 300 ping, and they're all robots just standing still.
[25:47.54]What's wrong with you?
[25:48.91]I don't know.
[25:50.25]Oh, 8.
[25:52.03]That's an 8.
[25:53.65]You wanted to get in shape?
[25:56.92]By the way, I gotta say, it's really bad form if you're in chat saying something like, well, I'm gonna donate this amount of money if something happens.
[26:05.87]Just, unless you actually mean it's gonna happen.
[26:08.29]Because that's a fun thing that we can enjoy bringing up as a little drama, a little strife to the show.
[26:14.18]So if you're just, you know, joshing, pulling someone's leg, you're raising money for charity, so.
[26:24.45]I'm raising money for liars.
[26:27.73]It's like Star, people want you to do some bizarre things for money.
[26:31.04]I wouldn't doubt it.
[26:33.34]I've done weirder.
[26:33.97]I wonder how much Teemo support would throw in if he didn't shirt off.
[26:41.66]Shirt off with Jerma.
[26:43.55]With both shirts off.
[26:45.77]Wait, what?
[26:48.15]All I heard was, I was trying to pay attention to be a medic, and I heard, shirts off with Jerma.
[26:54.78]That sounds like a bad workout video.
[26:59.29]Do like 8 minutes on Starz YouTube, how to get fit while flying TFC.
[27:04.26]The skyboxes on this map are so weird, I just... Yeah, I was watching that, it was weird.
[27:13.55]We also crossed over 13-3, so I will message Sean and Lang and ask them exactly what the total was.
[27:21.72]I'm guessing it was probably about 36.
[27:24.24]I thought it was more.
[27:25.69]Maybe with the extra raffle things at the end, it was more.
[27:31.51]But 36, so we're almost a third of the way there.
[27:34.54]Actually, over a third of the way there.
[27:35.48]I can do some math.
[27:36.74]And that's awesome, guys.
[27:37.60]Thank you so much.
[27:38.40]I don't think we're past the first hour of the stream, so that's amazing.
[27:43.25]Now we're a half hour in, like exactly, so yeah, this is pretty amazing.
[27:47.41]You guys are the best, keep it coming.
[27:50.88]Yeah, like a little bit of perspective, I was picking WhiskerBiscuit's brain before we went live, and I was like, how much money did we have in the bank last year before we even went live?
[27:59.15]It was like two grand, and this time we had 9k at least before we even went live, so we're already ahead of the curve.
[28:06.06]It's exciting.
[28:07.33]We have to throw in our big chunk of money for the Market Gardener kill heard around the world.
[28:12.47]Let's talk about that a little bit, because last year it was sort of up in the air.
[28:16.20]Sean and company had this great idea, this great cause for charity, and no one really knew how the community was going to react and how much they were going to open up their wallets.
[28:25.13]And throughout the day, throughout the first day, it was really humbling and it was awesome to see you guys, the community, such an awesome community, just
[28:33.94]be able to be so generous and to give so much, and like Sieber said earlier on when we opened up, for a great cause, you're doing it again.
[28:41.87]And as a player who's been in this game for, I don't know, seven, eight years now since beta, it's really cool to see that I've put myself in a game with a community that's so awesome.
[28:52.47]So you guys are the greatest, and I'm so happy.
[28:56.49]I love you too, Sivir.
[28:58.21]I'm Bloodsire.
[29:01.51]Freudian slip, sorry.
[29:03.74]You'll love me more tomorrow.
[29:04.58]I love Sivir also.
[29:06.85]Yeah, I think there was a lot of drama within that circle of people and things that were happening last year.
[29:14.10]Tip of the Hat's one.
[29:14.76]And then it sort of just through the raw energy of humans turned into this awesome event.
[29:19.94]And then, of course, the resources given by our awesome community.
[29:23.57]We get some flack sometimes for things that are said and done in our community.
[29:27.99]But when we all put our minds together, we're capable of pretty awesome things for the size of our community, really going above and beyond.
[29:35.40]This year's already been a success in the first, what, 40 minutes?
[29:40.54]Nine.
[29:41.43]Eight minutes, and I'm about to give all of my money to charity.
[29:45.69]Air shot!
[29:46.15]Going for a 20 kill streak.
[29:47.49]How much money do I get for Market Gardener kills?
[29:50.44]Oh, man.
[29:52.06]Is that Mabla?
[29:54.04]It is.
[29:54.30]It is the melee.
[29:55.22]Mabla, you're like one of the best players in the game, so... I'd be pretty careful.
[29:58.84]He's a Market Gardener shark, man.
[30:00.21]I've been watching him.
[30:00.95]He's gotten at least, like, eight, so...
[30:03.73]Mabla, I don't wanna, like you asked me, I just want to raise money for charity, so I might just be alright with it, but... How about, how about if you, if you hit a double air shot, Mabla, and I'm only gonna watch you from here on out, if you hit a double air shot, a true double air shot, I'll donate another hundred dollars.
[30:21.92]Okay.
[30:22.04]That is a big ask, but Mabla's really good at this game, so... I have no ammo.
[30:26.29]I'm going for the 20 streaker.
[30:28.15]I'm at like 10.
[30:29.72]I'm going for the two-streaker.
[30:31.06]I'm at one.
[30:33.33]I have no ammo.
[30:35.33]Oh, ammo.
[30:37.97]And if you're on the red team, Mablo's on the blue team right now.
[30:40.32]Or male, I should say.
[30:41.52]Maybe he's friggin' Bloodscythe over here.
[30:45.15]Please jump at this guy.
[30:46.13]I want to see a legit double air shot.
[30:48.35]I don't want to see him pop a heavy up and, you know, skip shot him and put off the ground.
[30:54.09]You know, I did a cast the other night that Milo was a part of, and I hadn't seen his name in a while, and I fell into my old ways, and I was pronouncing that three as a B. And I didn't care for a while.
[31:02.98]It's a B. Yes.
[31:05.72]There are a list of people doing the Ulfie Duo slash MGE mod tournament, which is happening, I think, later today.
[31:13.65]Maybe tomorrow as well.
[31:14.61]I'm not sure exactly when those are.
[31:15.89]Tipofthehats.com is our official schedule.
[31:19.58]Oh my god, a heavy's gonna do it.
[31:22.50]Oh.
[31:24.07]I'm sorry, that was close.
[31:26.22]You go for a 20-streaker and get taken out by the Bop Heavy?
[31:29.90]That's no way to go down.
[31:32.23]Damn.
[31:33.41]We gotta defend this.
[31:36.93]It's all about defense.
[31:40.92]B. Aggressive.
[31:42.38]B. B. Aggressive.
[31:45.17]Of course, what doesn't help me is the fact that we have Mila and Mala in Mumble, and that's very confusing.
[31:52.08]That's true.
[31:56.07]Oh, no, it's over.
[31:57.05]14.
[31:57.45]Well, I'm looking for this double from Maela.
[32:02.52]We have crits on in this pub.
[32:04.14]This pub is awesome.
[32:05.22]I love this pub.
[32:07.32]Oh, I killed Jerma.
[32:10.14]Oh, hey, Jerma's here.
[32:11.18]How are you, Jerma?
[32:12.07]Oh, hi, Maela.
[32:13.53]So, Maela, you are in Kurt's house right now, yeah?
[32:17.51]I am two feet away from Lang.
[32:21.40]Two feet away from Lang.
[32:22.04]That's almost too close.
[32:25.18]What is Ground Zero like over there?
[32:27.96]Were they hectic all day this morning getting ready, or was it pretty chill?
[32:32.01]It was a mix of hectic.
[32:35.49]It was more hectic trying to get my setup in.
[32:37.91]They've been ready, prepared.
[32:40.54]Your setup doesn't work at your own house.
[32:42.98]No, it doesn't work at my house.
[32:51.63]Okay, so...
[32:53.83]Alright, so here's the deal, and I'm sorry, Mala.
[32:57.84]Regular Mala, not Mela.
[32:59.22]I didn't know, I saw you were in here, but I didn't know what the deal was, no one told me.
[33:02.56]But Mala, um, you are here, yeah?
[33:05.24]Yeah, I'm here.
[33:06.10]Hello, Mala.
[33:07.03]Mala is awesome, and she actually worked this summer.
[33:10.55]I'm not sure if it's work or some kind of time donation.
[33:13.07]She's a nurse, and she helped out at one of the One Step actual physical camps this summer, is that right?
[33:18.58]Yep, in Wisconsin.
[33:19.98]That is awesome.
[33:20.92]I, um...
[33:22.44]Would love to know all about that.
[33:24.16]I actually talked to you on Steam a couple times about it and how great of an experience it was.
[33:28.61]So I don't know how to get into it here.
[33:31.45]How did you get involved in the One Step thing?
[33:33.47]Is it just sort of a Midwestern thing?
[33:35.60]You saw a sign up or something?
[33:37.20]Yeah, I was actually looking at the website and I saw that they needed help with medical staff.
[33:42.33]So I applied and I was able to volunteer there for about five days.
[33:47.17]Tell our viewers what it's like.
[33:49.12]None of them have ever probably seen a picture or anything about the set up.
[33:52.66]Is it just kind of a traditional summer camp or what's the deal?
[33:56.11]It is on actually a college campus right on a lake and it is beautiful.
[34:01.55]Yeah.
[34:03.20]So tell us, I don't know, I want to know sort of what exactly the money is going to.
[34:12.23]You send a kid to camp.
[34:13.95]What is that kid experience?
[34:15.88]What is it like there?
[34:17.04]Well, I think the most important part is the kid is just able to be a kid.
[34:20.87]I mean, they don't have to worry about their medical treatments and tests and pills.
[34:25.67]During camp, we bring all of their pills and treatment to their activities instead of them having to leave their activities to do the medical things.
[34:34.34]They don't have to go to the hospital.
[34:36.18]All of the doctors are actually there on staff.
[34:39.21]They can see them, write antibiotics.
[34:41.45]They can get their chemo treatments while they're at camp, which is really fantastic.
[34:47.60]I know that I saw a picture, Mala, one time.
[34:52.09]Was it you or somebody?
[34:54.09]Had the kids made a sign that said, thank you, Tip of the Hats, or something, something, Tip of the Hats.
[35:00.44]I swear I saw that.
[35:02.24]Didn't I?
[35:02.44]Yeah, yeah.
[35:03.42]That was for me.
[35:04.23]I talked to my little group of kids, and I told them all about Tip of the Hats, and they were really excited.
[35:09.99]So they wanted to make a sign for Tip of the Hats, and so they worked on their little art project, and it was really great.
[35:16.87]Where is that picture?
[35:17.85]I feel like we should have that everywhere.
[35:19.39]I can upload it really quick.
[35:21.99]You can definitely upload it real quick, and then we'll hopefully get it on the site or something.
[35:25.56]Because, yeah, I saw that, and I thought that was awesome.
[35:27.28]They put a big smile on my face.
[35:29.95]By the way, chat, you are proving my theory correct on every front.
[35:34.56]I'm very disappointed to know you, chat.
[35:38.60]And Star, I gotta say, they want you to sing Wrecking Ball.
[35:41.18]Yeah, I've been looking over occasionally and noticing that.
[35:45.37]Sorry to let you guys down, I don't think it's gonna happen.
[35:48.47]What if we got a duet between you and Jerma?
[35:52.14]I don't know.
[35:53.82]I think it's even less likely to happen.
[35:58.51]It might just be a Christmas miracle.
[36:00.75]When singing occurs on this stream, nothing good happens from it.
[36:05.26]A whole new world.
[36:09.39]Go for it, man.
[36:11.35]I'll do it.
[36:11.89]That was disastrous.
[36:13.07]Let's not do that again.
[36:15.14]I'll sing.
[36:15.56]I'll sing.
[36:16.36]I'll sing for money.
[36:17.50]I'm not afraid.
[36:18.46]I don't know.
[36:18.84]Wrecking Ball, though, I'd sing it.
[36:21.32]We need to frame it right, though.
[36:22.32]It needs to be like Star coming in with a Kritz Krieg, singing Wrecking Ball, wrecking the place.
[36:26.73]You know, it's got to be beautiful visually as well.
[36:29.43]I bet Star's a really good singer, too.
[36:31.18]He's just really good at it.
[36:32.97]What is going on right now?
[36:35.25]You're just a multi-talented guy.
[36:37.10]This is like a real live action fanfic taking place right now.
[36:41.56]Even when he talks, it sounds like he's singing, you know?
[36:43.79]He's just got such a melodic voice, you know?
[36:46.83]Star, uh... Will you sing the whole chorus of Wrecking Ball to your heart's content?
[36:55.26]You gotta, like, project it.
[36:58.61]For 500 bucks.
[36:59.73]To the donation.
[37:00.58]You would donate $500.
[37:02.14]I will donate $500 if you sing the chorus of Wrecking Ball.
[37:07.05]You have to give it your all, though.
[37:08.89]No, like, I came in like a wrecking ball.
[37:12.04]I don't even know the words.
[37:13.72]I mean, like, if we're going to do this, if I'm going to pull it off, I'd like to reschedule to, like, tomorrow.
[37:22.51]No, that is totally okay.
[37:24.98]You're going to practice all night?
[37:26.69]I'm going to practice and we're going to build up the hype.
[37:29.32]I'm going to make a trailer.
[37:31.19]Like this is a big production.
[37:34.78]Alright.
[37:36.13]Real quick, we have a $100 donation from Sea Green Max.
[37:41.63]And he did leave a comment, and I would love to see that comment.
[37:44.52]Oh, it's a pending approval.
[37:45.94]So I actually have the tracker open, guys.
[37:47.60]So I'll try to get to some of your more generous donations.
[37:51.89]A $150 donation from Josh.

[38:20.35]We have a $5 donation, Justin, from GirlGamerAA.
[38:24.31]Hey!
[38:25.66]We're branching out.
[38:26.82]We are a multi-gender organization now.
[38:29.96]Should be.
[38:30.88]Yeah.
[38:33.53]So, Molly, are you hanging out with us the rest of the day, or what?
[38:36.25]Is it just, like, the first little bit?
[38:38.78]The whole day?
[38:41.44]You're happy now that you said that.
[38:43.30]Oh, jeez.
[38:44.31]Yeah.
[38:46.33]Are you playing any of it for guys who don't know?
[38:47.92]Maul is a competitive or used to be competitive medic.
[38:52.31]Pretty good.
[38:53.13]Are you going to be playing anything?
[38:54.75]Are you?
[38:55.37]I wasn't planning on it, but I can.
[38:56.52]You should do a randomizer thing with us tonight.
[38:58.04]That's fun.
[38:58.30]Alright, alright.
[39:00.07]Everybody in the server is officially better than me still.
[39:02.79]Great.
[39:04.62]I think it's about time to call quits on the market gardening.
[39:08.14]Yeah, we are at Badlands now.
[39:10.32]Yeah, you can't really do it on Badlands last.
[39:12.87]Okay, if you want to end it, that's fine.
[39:14.83]I'll still keep it out there until the end of this hour.
[39:16.99]What was your official number?
[39:18.75]Nine.
[39:19.88]A very high amount.
[39:21.38]That's pretty good.
[39:22.08]Well, that's nine bucks.
[39:30.53]That was quick.
[39:31.89]Two team shuffling here.
[39:33.27]Looks like one red team too good, too strong.
[39:37.06]None of my classes have hats anymore.
[39:43.33]They gave them all away.
[39:44.57]Gave all your hats away?
[39:45.43]Like, every character I go on to play, like, oh, I'm gonna play demo now.
[39:47.96]I have to, like, reset my hats.
[39:49.44]Now I know, like, what it's like for everyone else playing this game.
[39:52.19]You're just always messing with your hats.
[39:53.95]I think it's funny, how many people are waiting to join on the top left of my screen?
[39:57.40]I'm sure it's on the thing.
[40:00.78]People waiting for the reserved spots?
[40:02.83]It's pretty awesome.
[40:03.41]Come with me.
[40:05.47]Okay, let's go.
[40:06.47]That's you.
[40:07.19]This is you right here.
[40:08.43]No, that is me.
[40:09.10]That's me.
[40:10.06]That's the spot behind you.
[40:13.06]You guys are the best dancing players I've ever seen.
[40:15.79]You got it.
[40:19.82]I see a bunch of people bringing up the wrecking ball thing, so let's make a clarification statement.
[40:38.11]I will be donating $500 to the charity tomorrow.
[40:42.23]when Star tomorrow at some point sings Wrecking Ball in a giant production.
[40:48.02]A giant production, what does that mean?
[40:50.56]Yeah, those are his words.
[40:52.00]I don't know what you can actually do to make it a giant production.
[40:56.69]Like, I don't know.
[40:57.23]Like, if I do it, what are you expecting?
[40:58.47]Like, oh, there wasn't, like, women and dancing and ballerinas.
[41:02.13]Yeah, you'd need, like, lasers and sound effects and... Lasers?
[41:07.08]There's gotta be, like, at least ten laser beams, like, going all over the place.
[41:10.85]Well, Lang and TruckTruck and Mabwa is going to get on the lasers.
[41:16.88]See, Vera, I've hit so many single air shots and then come so close to the double.
[41:21.62]I've not been watching.
[41:22.46]I want to see it, so I'm glad you haven't done any.
[41:24.47]I'm sure you'll get it.
[41:25.25]Just hang it on Spire, man.
[41:27.43]There's so many rocket jumper soldiers that every time... You should join the other team.
[41:31.67]Your team is ruining.
[41:34.96]But I'm the only soldier.
[41:35.88]There's no rocket jumper this time.
[41:37.70]That's true.
[41:38.58]I'll go on the other team and jump at you.
[41:41.14]okay we have some staging but I cant some collusion is this collusion
[41:50.66]I think it's actually okay to just lie and just tell them you hit a double air shot.
[41:54.29]You know, really sell it, though.
[41:56.47]I mean, it's for a good cause, man.
[42:00.12]How hard can you fake a double air shot, you know?
[42:02.94]I'm sure it's not the last time... Yeah, I'm sure it's not the last time I'm going to donate anyway, so... I mean, either way, the money's coming out, but it might be...
[42:11.96]Might be fun to see mob.
[42:12.94]A double air shot in a pub, that's pretty impressive.
[42:16.18]I'm surprised you haven't gone to the direct hit, to be completely honest.
[42:19.63]But if I hit someone, they're just gonna die instantly.
[42:21.69]I get your hosta, but if you find a heavy... You double air shot a heavy!
[42:27.30]That's like bonus.
[42:29.34]I guess I would probably decrypt, yeah.
[42:31.10]He has to be buffed.
[42:33.38]You can't pop a heavy up.
[42:36.29]Reliably.
[42:37.71]What is that?
[42:38.67]I just read in Twitch chat.
[42:39.76]15k broken.
[42:41.03]Uh-oh.
[42:44.54]15K broken already, and they're not even through the first hour.
[42:47.59]That is awesome.
[42:48.61]Almost 6,000 people on the stream watching, so awesome.
[42:52.15]Thank you for watching Star and company play a pub.
[42:56.36]The Highlander match is coming up in, what, about 20 minutes, 15, 20 minutes, something around there, and that's going to be the first of our, I don't want to say true events, because everything is an event today and tomorrow, but that's going to be North America versus the European...
[43:11.44]Union, and that should be fun.
[43:13.18]Admirable always gets really into these matches, because Europe is very important to him and their ability to play TF2.
[43:20.97]So, we'll see.
[43:21.71]I don't know, I'm feeling NA.
[43:22.57]It's not anymore, man.
[43:24.60]You know, last time, it was after North America came to Europe and conquered Atlan, but now, you know, we've really set the record straight, so I don't care anymore, man.
[43:32.65]I'm just gonna be like, yeah, whatever.
[43:33.79]Americans, roll my eyes.
[43:36.17]You guys can play TF2.
[43:39.15]Well, I mean, we can.
[43:40.25]Like, we're allowed.
[43:44.03]It's not very well, is what I'm saying, you know?
[43:46.75]Oh man, I thought that was going to be at my blood, that mid.
[43:49.19]It's not over yet, but... There's no one to... I need to switch teams, but there's no teams to switch.
[43:55.62]There's... Everyone is dying.
[44:00.05]Yeah, they're not going to have, like, an 11 versus 12 thing.
[44:06.12]Because everyone wants to play.
[44:07.34]Um...
[44:09.41]Yeah, that is going to be... That's actually two hours.
[44:11.21]I'm not sure where my guy Salomancer is.
[44:13.07]He was supposed to, I thought, be here for the beginning part.
[44:16.08]If worse comes to worse... You're going to step up?
[44:19.54]We got lots of people here.
[44:20.90]Yeah, I might.
[44:21.78]I might.
[44:22.38]Yeah, no, I just love Sal.
[44:25.01]You don't love me?
[44:26.29]I love you.
[44:26.79]I thought we had something.
[44:28.83]You're getting the crit spot on you.
[44:30.02]How are you supposed to double air shot a guy with crits?
[44:32.00]I don't know.
[44:33.20]Situations are just not for me right now.
[44:37.01]Oh, you're getting dunked on.
[44:38.38]You're gonna get dunked on.
[44:40.32]Is that you?
[44:40.58]Yeah.
[44:40.74]Oh, shit.
[44:43.52]You and your, like, endless pocket medic just got dunked on.
[44:48.13]Did, like, what, 30 damage total?
[44:49.41]What if I give the Reserve Shooter four shots?
[44:51.08]That's what I want to know.
[44:52.16]Yeah, I had that on last night.
[44:54.74]Not that long ago.
[45:01.41]Oh, this guy's in the infinite glitch.
[45:05.84]are you gonna get dunked on?
[45:10.20]Is that what just happened?
[45:12.57]Oh my god!
[45:15.57]The truck truck!
[45:15.91]Oh my goodness!
[45:18.74]My god!
[45:19.40]The flank of all flanks!
[45:22.38]I'm so glad that's like a truck truck.
[45:27.69]Well that is now the Jerm, I don't think truck trucks have ever gotten nine of them.
[45:31.03]What was that, five?
[45:31.81]You got a 5k with the friggin' boxes?
[45:38.73]With a maniacal laugh, which is required if you're going to do this.
[45:42.50]We have a $150 donation from Dr. Mike Hunt.
[45:49.12]Thank you, Dr. Mike.
[45:50.38]I like the separation in the words there.
[45:53.43]Oh, get dunked!
[45:54.53]You want to get dunked?
[45:56.13]He goes so fast.
[45:56.81]I thought I got him.
[45:57.85]Too fast, too quick.
[45:59.84]He almost got dunked.
[46:01.24]And I would love to read your comments, guys.
[46:02.96]I'm not sure if those comments are showing up on stream or not, but it is pending approval when I look at them, so we appreciate it, Dr. Mike, but whatever you wrote in your comment, I'm sure it was awesome.
[46:14.74]and hilarious like your name is.
[46:17.20]I was scrolling through the donation page yesterday and by far my favorite was Dr. Redundant MD who donated like 50 bucks or something like that.
[46:25.76]I thought that was really clever.
[46:27.60]Yeah, um, we haven't had to say this guy's name yet.
[46:30.20]I kind of want to be the first one to do it.
[46:33.08]But, um, because it's like the best name ever.
[46:37.41]Um, we have a popular trader who donated a bunch of the unusual hats which are being raffled off.
[46:43.10]And, uh, he goes by the name of, uh, Too Much Anal.
[46:46.94]That's actually his name.
[46:47.86]So, I'm not, it's not just me being stupid.
[46:50.37]That's just his name.
[46:51.35]So, he's donated a lot of resources.
[46:54.07]Not just money.
[46:54.75]I think he's donated a lot of money, too.
[46:56.58]Um, so...
[46:57.28]I'm going to call him TooMuchA.
[46:59.84]You're my guy.
[47:00.49]Thank you so much.
[47:01.15]Your name is hilarious.
[47:03.23]You guys are awesome, man.
[47:04.80]I'm looking down at the stream just seeing the names pop up every 10, 20, 30 seconds.
[47:11.15]Another donation will come in.
[47:14.02]It's just, you guys are awesome.
[47:15.22]Like, what is it, almost $16,000 now?
[47:18.13]Yeah, we're at $15,565 with a $20,000 goal.
[47:22.07]We only need $4,434 left.
[47:23.76]So, you guys are great.
[47:26.66]Like Seabird said, we're halfway now.
[47:28.90]We're just about halfway to what we made last year.
[47:31.37]So, yeah, definitely.
[47:33.21]You guys keep it coming.
[47:35.60]Yeah, we don't have a set goal in mind, at least that we've vocalized or that I've heard from the boys.
[47:41.47]Four million.
[47:42.55]I'm guessing they don't want to just stop at breaking last year.
[47:45.12]Four million, let's do it.
[47:46.24]Let's crush awesome games done quick.
[47:48.80]Show those nerds what's up.
[47:49.89]No, I think that breaking the record would be great, but I think that we can do even better than that.
[47:56.78]Oh, get dunked.
[47:58.08]Star onto Mabwa.
[48:01.10]But sorry, every time you kill him, it takes his chances of a double away, which hurts charity, so you're being kind of a bad guy right now.
[48:06.95]Brad Pitt donated $100.
[48:08.46]Thank you, Brad Pitt.
[48:10.60]Thank you.
[48:11.18]Say hi to Angelina for me.
[48:17.21]I'm going to try to figure out what the comment thing is, because if someone's donating $150, they should get their silly comment read.
[48:24.25]You know what would be worth mentioning?
[48:25.47]I understand there's also a tip of the hats hat.
[48:29.88]That's right.
[48:30.90]It's in the community workshop.
[48:32.76]You can see it if you go onto the Twitch page.
[48:34.99]You're already there.
[48:35.51]You're watching the stream down below.
[48:36.55]There's a link.
[48:37.53]And that's something everybody can do.
[48:38.49]You don't have to donate.
[48:39.11]All you have to do is log into Steam and hit that like button.
[48:41.78]I'm not even sure what's going to happen with the hat.
[48:43.54]If it's going to be monetized or something.
[48:45.68]But I'm sure that is the end goal.
[48:47.42]But everybody, just go in there right now and show your support by upvoting that hat like that bad boy.
[48:54.16]Yeah, basically to get that hat into TF2, we need it to be upvoted.
[48:58.32]We need it to be favorited.
[48:59.48]So make sure you go to that page.
[49:01.26]Like Admiral just said, like it and favorite it.
[49:03.77]Hopefully we get that bad boy in the actual game.
[49:08.35]Are you just going to start repeating these silly European phrases like, Troy, again, Bloodtire will be cheeky plays all day?
[49:14.88]Yeah, don't start that.
[49:16.14]I won't be repeating Biff at all.
[49:18.08]Try a Seabird might.
[49:19.46]Biff is not European.
[49:20.48]That's awesome.
[49:21.50]Yeah, it will.
[49:25.05]That comes back to me.
[49:27.42]We have a $15 donation from $5 for the kids.
[49:33.01]I don't know why I think that's funny.
[49:36.15]That's funny.
[49:36.43]That's kind of funny.
[49:37.47]Mildly humorous.
[49:40.66]Let's do an extra 10.
[49:41.96]Thank you, $5.
[49:44.48]Okay, dumb.
[49:45.83]Oh my god.
[49:47.65]I'm one of those.
[49:51.38]Going big sentry.
[49:53.12]Protecting the last point.
[49:55.06]I'd like to see you try to get it.
[49:57.23]Oh, which... Blue?
[49:59.55]Yeah, blue.
[50:02.99]Better hurry up, he's there with you.
[50:06.30]Oh, wanna see you try and get it.
[50:11.91]Yeah, it's alright.
[50:14.39]Yeah, whatever.
[50:15.33]What a big sentry.
[50:16.33]Held off the backup, though.
[50:17.69]I was too busy looking at chat.
[50:21.16]I didn't even know you were down here.
[50:23.13]You came down there to fight me.
[50:25.17]What do you mean you don't know I was there?
[50:26.27]He said I was there, too.
[50:28.05]Yeah, well, I was too busy looking or something.
[50:32.30]We have a $100 donation from TMA.
[50:36.33]Thank you, TMA.
[50:37.17]A lot of big donations get the $100.
[50:41.01]That is awesome.
[50:42.91]Hopefully that helped me cover the Mark Gardner fund here.

[51:40.28]The ground is shaking!
[51:40.82]The
[51:41.37]I don't know, just, it's places.
[51:48.00]I think I've gotten, like, nine air shot kills in this event.
[51:52.02]Just none of them, none of them double.
[51:54.03]Yeah, the double, I gotta see the double though.
[51:56.17]There's even one, I knew it was gonna happen, there was a demo with the charge in charge, and I thought, and I pinned him up against a wall, I'm like, oh, here it is, it's happening, and then he had like 50 health.
[52:06.06]I have not been watching it, so you could have been like, oh, I got the double!
[52:09.69]You know, I thought I am strictly on melee cam right now to make sure... Oh, you really?
[52:12.83]Yeah.
[52:14.23]You got his name right.
[52:15.76]Did I?
[52:16.38]It's always like 50-50 when I go to say his name, so I really never know.
[52:21.53]The three throws you off, you know?
[52:25.48]Oh, melee!
[52:25.74]I don't know what it counted.
[52:27.10]gift shot or something.
[52:28.32]That's pretty strong.
[52:29.64]So now I can actually read donations.
[52:31.43]I know a lot of the donation comments are just Steam IDs.
[52:34.23]I believe that is the way that you enter yourself into the raffles, which I haven't said yet.
[52:39.09]I think that's correct.
[52:39.99]Do you guys know if that's right?
[52:41.98]You should know.
[52:44.22]Where's Sean Budvin this whole time?
[52:45.62]I feel like he's a guy.
[52:47.74]He's doing his thing, you know?
[52:50.20]Alright, alright.
[52:51.01]I can respect that.
[52:53.97]Can I have a Steam ID?
[52:54.73]Okay.
[52:56.33]Whatever you want in the comment, those would be Steam ID.
[52:57.97]Sorry, I said anything.
[52:59.37]Yeah, no, if you go to the... Camera on me, camera on me, camera on me, camera on me!
[53:02.30]If you go to the donation page, there's like a complete menu where you get to fill out multiple boxes.
[53:06.83]There's donation amount, comment, filter amount, what you want to be entered into, all those different things.
[53:12.72]People were even typing in chat trying to ruin it.
[53:18.03]Yeah, Bloodtire, if you go to that donations page as well, there's a beautifully voice-overed video there, narrated video by WhiskerBiscuit, man, that is just, like, syrupy.
[53:29.37]Just put me at ease with parting with my money.
[53:31.91]Check it out.
[53:32.69]It's true, it's definitely true.
[53:34.21]It's a great and useful tool.
[53:35.79]If you're wondering about how to donate, maybe a little anxious about getting it right, definitely check out the video by Whisker.
[53:41.78]He did a good job walking you through it.
[53:47.27]I am... Lang gave me a login and password so I can see the comments.
[53:52.32]My password is actually the most ridiculous thing anyone's ever come up with.
[53:55.98]I thought you were going to say the password.
[53:58.09]I could say it's 50 characters and it's nonsense, like exclamation points and equal signs and periods and capitals and numbers.
[54:08.24]It's pretty good.
[54:08.98]Yeah, did that help you?
[54:11.12]You got it?
[54:11.72]Yeah, I figured it out.
[54:12.42]You get a better chance of winning Donald Trump's billion dollar bracket than guessing this.
[54:19.44]Is that a challenge?
[54:24.28]Damn it.
[54:27.75]And this will not work.
[54:35.52]Sorry, Lane.
[54:37.20]20 bucks if Starajarma pulls off a taunt kill.
[54:39.65]I feel like I woulda.
[54:41.35]Guys, I tried.
[54:44.73]I could probably get someone with the Huntsman.
[54:47.16]I think I'm gonna do that.
[54:49.28]I'll go for some guitar smashes.
[54:57.25]I think I'm gonna pull it off.
[55:00.56]Oh, you think so?
[55:01.60]Yeah, I think I'm gonna pull it off.
[55:02.50]You think you're gonna pull it off?
[55:05.12]I think I'm gonna pull it off before you pull it off.
[55:06.63]Are we gonna stop this again?
[55:08.95]We can't, like, do this again.
[55:10.25]Whoever loses has to give $100 to charity.
[55:14.67]I think you missed the Jerma Market Gardener situation.
[55:19.70]I bet you a hundred bucks to start with that.
[55:26.62]I thought I would donate a hundred dollars if Jerma got a Market Gardener kill.
[55:29.37]He did it.
[55:30.59]He did?
[55:30.97]He did.
[55:31.87]See?
[55:32.17]As surprised as I am.
[55:33.67]He did it within like five minutes.
[55:36.65]So you're saying you shot the ground with a rocket and went airborne?
[55:41.64]Yeah.
[55:42.10]Is this your first time?
[55:44.18]No, I've done it before.
[55:45.47]This kawaii person, very kawaii.
[55:56.28]We're incognito here, we're undercover.
[55:58.86]Oh, this is way better, Wayne.
[56:00.21]Nice.
[56:03.89]I don't think this taunt kill counts, but I got one.
[56:08.44]I don't think it counts.
[56:15.32]Okay, so now I can read your comments.
[56:17.54]I'm obviously not going to read your nonsense, like this guy who donated 69 with the, you know, the triple name that's inappropriate like eight times.
[56:26.03]Way to go, buddy.
[56:27.13]We'll take your 69 cents.
[56:29.90]This is...
[56:33.27]Okay, we actually need to wrap this up as we get ready to go to Highlander next.
[56:39.08]I don't know where Sal is.
[56:40.93]If he's here, I hope he's here.
[56:42.35]I see him.
[56:45.35]He's here.
[56:45.84]Okay, good.
[56:46.50]My guy Sal is here.
[56:47.50]I've not spoken to Sal in forever.
[56:49.32]So sad.
[56:50.12]I miss him.
[56:51.38]Unfortunately, this is where we're going to end this pub session.
[56:53.99]There's plenty to come, which I guess we're going to do is cut to a little break music and such.
[56:59.01]Maybe we'll stay in the pub, but we're not going to be talking while we get people ready to go.
[57:03.80]It is going to be admirable and Sal casting NA versus EU Highlander, and that is going to be for the next two hours.
[57:11.10]And then I probably will be dipping out for those two hours since Highlander doesn't agree with me.
[57:15.95]Makes me gassy.
[57:17.13]unfortunately but we will I think I'll be back at some point here hopefully uh so thanks everybody great start we're already over halfway there I want to say or close to halfway there if you want to do the math and we'll see you in a little bit for highlander EU versus na
