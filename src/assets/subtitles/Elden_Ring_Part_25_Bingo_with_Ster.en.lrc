[00:08.14]No, they're saying Ster live.
[00:10.26]Say what do they think Ster live?
[00:12.41]Yeah.
[00:13.93]Hey, I'm live too.
[00:16.61]What do you say about that?
[00:19.13]Jerma live.
[00:21.45]Hi everybody.
[00:25.13]We have something very, very special today.
[00:26.89]I did.
[00:27.37]I don't know intro.
[00:28.33]I didn't have an intro screen Ster had an intro though.
[00:30.29]It's fine.
[00:31.63]No, I didn't.
[00:32.50]Oh you didn't know I just right before you came back.
[00:39.59]Alright, so do you want to, how do you want to explain this?
[00:42.41]Let's go over what's going on today.
[00:44.19]Okay.
[00:44.89]Hi, everybody.
[00:45.45]How are you?
[00:46.45]Good to see you again.
[00:47.03]Hi.
[00:48.84]Hi.
[00:49.74]So today, we are going to do Elden Ring Bingo Night.
[00:56.26]Now, what is Elden Ring Bingo Night, Ster?
[00:58.16]Do you have any idea what that is?
[01:00.38]I have a couple of ideas.
[01:03.42]As I understand it, and as you will all understand it soon, is that we're going to be competing to get bingo on a bingo board.
[01:10.30]Competing various actions in and out of Elden Ring.
[01:17.91]Well, don't say out of Elden Ring.
[01:19.13]What do you mean out of Elden Ring?
[01:21.17]I mean like... What do you mean out of Elden Ring?
[01:26.16]Right?
[01:26.70]Doesn't that like... Yeah, the real world does exist.
[01:29.12]That's true.
[01:30.60]So I'd like to not forget that.
[01:32.06]You know, disassociation is an issue these days.
[01:34.94]Okay, so here's how this is going to work.
[01:39.15]We have a bingo board that we are going to show.
[01:43.09]There are, start correct me if I'm wrong, there are about 50 squares across two games that we are going to play.
[01:52.32]So how is this going to work?
[01:54.02]You see on the screen right now there's just a naked character.
[01:57.32]That's fine.
[01:57.98]We are both level 110.
[02:00.83]We have access to the DLC already.
[02:04.23]So we already have access to the DLC.
[02:06.79]Very important on top of that, we get to choose
[02:11.20]We ain't even getting started yet.
[02:13.10]We're going to spend about 30 minutes.
[02:14.42]We're working with our communities to make sure that we get the exact items that we want because we can only choose five.
[02:21.72]We have five slots.
[02:23.36]You can go and you can take from there if you want.
[02:25.26]Basically, we're skipping the whole gathering item start at the start of a new run.
[02:31.68]So we have a couple of graces already on the map.
[02:34.12]We're going to be able to start with weapons and then it's more about completing the bingo board than, you know,
[02:40.47]coming out of the gate at level one.
[02:42.25]Get a little bit more into the... into the Elden Ring so we can go to more places.
[02:46.73]Right.
[02:47.09]So, very important, we only get to choose five items.
[02:50.99]That includes talismans.
[02:52.97]That includes, uh, weapons.
[02:55.27]That includes armor.
[02:56.72]That also includes spells.
[02:58.58]So, over the course of the next 20-30 minutes in our own communities, we're going to try to figure out the best possible combination.
[03:04.36]You know, I might just do four of a full, like, havel set.
[03:08.04]And, like, a dagger.
[03:09.98]or who knows but we have to really be very careful about this because I know you we've went back and forth about not being too try hard but I don't know how that's gonna play out I really don't know because I don't want to lose every single square so well yeah the the goal is that when we we're not like souls speed runners no we need an advantage to actually be able to kill a boss so uh you know if we uh we run out of here like soul level one we're gonna be here all week
[03:40.74]Somebody said it sounds like you're in the ceiling.
[03:42.26]Wait, what?
[03:42.72]Why?
[03:42.94]Why?
[03:44.96]It sounds like you're coming through fine for me.
[03:47.06]Do they mean you?
[03:51.38]No.
[03:51.54]Ster live?
[03:52.14]You live?
[03:53.86]Yeah.
[03:54.52]I'm alive.
[03:55.07]I'm here.
[03:55.39]Alright.
[03:56.75]Are you ready, Ster, to spend the next 20 to 30 minutes getting your shit together?
[04:07.09]Yes.
[04:07.33]Okay.
[04:10.45]See you in 20 minutes.
[04:12.11]Okay.
[04:14.13]Okay, you just tell me when you're done.
[04:15.27]Okay.
[04:17.37]Because nice guys finish last.
[04:19.47]But he's supposed to be fucking muted and he's not.
[04:22.14]Okay.
[04:23.14]Very, very, very important.
[04:26.22]Let's go ahead and take a look at... Why can't I move my guy?
[04:34.20]What the fuck happened?
[04:42.68]Hey, there we go.
[04:43.96]Okay.
[04:44.94]So we have access to... By the way, we didn't say this, but every weapon is plus 25 or plus 10.
[04:50.56]So here we go.
[04:52.73]Access to everything.
[04:53.85]I don't know what I want to do.
[04:57.03]I don't know what to do.
[04:59.31]Because I'm not very good at video games.
[05:00.95]Snur is really good at games.
[05:02.87]I don't know what I should be picking here.
[05:07.03]Do Blasphemous Blade?
[05:07.95]I... We kind of had a gentleman's agreement that we weren't going to be fucking, like, do the, like, the really try-hard shit.
[05:16.35]Alright, is Blasphemous Blade a gentleman's agreement?
[05:18.85]What do you think?
[05:27.51]You should take the St. Trina's Torch.
[05:29.38]No.
[05:32.44]Okay, here's what I was thinking.
[05:33.68]This is what I wanted to do, I think.
[05:35.84]I'm thinking.
[05:36.72]Tell me if this is stupid.
[05:38.90]Madness build.
[05:40.64]The Madness Talisman, because it's a huge pain in the ass to go get.
[05:43.30]Wouldn't have to go get it.
[05:44.88]Madness Talisman with, like, the Laser Eye spell.
[05:49.67]That's two slots.
[05:53.19]Is that stupid?
[05:53.91]That's really stupid.
[05:54.95]Very stupid.
[05:55.61]Really?
[05:55.85]Okay.
[06:00.25]I need armor, too.
[06:06.83]Oh, wait, there's no, oh, wait, no, we can't, we don't have any armor.
[06:10.94]There's no, I don't think we have access to any armor.
[06:13.52]Okay, alright, that actually makes this really easy, but I need to go get fucking armor somewhere.
[06:17.66]Where can I get armor?
[06:19.60]Oh, we are so fucking screwed.
[06:23.30]It's gonna have to be a naked run.
[06:24.24]We have to go get armor.
[06:26.69]Alright, talismans counts as well.
[06:30.80]We're gonna run this twice, by the way, so even if I fuck up right now, it's okay.
[06:34.42]I think I'm going for it.
[06:35.24]I'm going Madness.
[06:36.68]And by the way, don't be a stream hopper until, you know, don't, come on.
[06:40.28]Come on, quit.
[06:40.72]Don't do that.
[06:42.16]Alright, I think we're going Madness with the Madness Talisman.
[06:45.68]What is Madness?
[06:46.44]Is it just Faith?
[06:50.40]I think it's just Faith.
[06:52.38]Yeah, Frenzied Burst is the, like, pew!
[06:55.56]Pew!
[06:57.42]I don't think I want any other moves from Madness.
[07:09.21]Bandits only works on other players.
[07:11.27]Yeah, but I remember this spell being crazy.
[07:14.76]You're going to have a really bad time.
[07:20.98]Yeah, what about like this?
[07:26.12]This thing here.
[07:26.72]Should I just take the machine gun?
[07:29.38]Oh, he's talking.
[07:30.06]He's talking to me.
[07:32.16]Hey, yeah, what was that?
[07:33.54]I left a lot of spells in the inventory.
[07:35.16]You just put him in the stash by accident.
[07:38.35]Yeah, no, that's fine.
[07:39.85]Yeah, wink.
[07:40.79]Good luck.
[07:41.49]Wait, before you go anywhere, I've got something important to tell you.
[07:44.37]There's no armor in this inventory.
[07:48.01]Oh, yeah, because I thought we were going to find armor.
[07:50.79]Okay, no, that's fine.
[07:51.86]Just making sure that that was what our intention was.
[07:54.32]I know we talked about you could choose an armor, but I think that it was too late.
[08:00.18]Uh, I'm either going to get rolled or, uh, no, I'm not.
[08:04.58]We know what, we know what the possible squares are.
[08:07.20]It's going to be, it's going to be fucking evenly matched.
[08:12.18]Just find some armor.
[08:14.09]Okay.
[08:14.61]There, there's so many places in the game that have a full armor set on the ground.
[08:19.91]Think about it.
[08:21.27]I don't remember anything about that guy.
[08:23.07]Think, think you've got 20 minutes.
[08:24.69]Think about it.
[08:25.63]Okay.
[08:25.91]Okay.
[08:26.13]Okay.
[08:26.33]Okay.
[08:26.55]Alright.
[08:29.76]I don't know where any armor is.
[08:33.87]Alright, mute.
[08:34.29]You're not supposed to be listening to me right now.
[08:36.33]You're... You... Why did... Why did that have, like, eight syllables?
[08:45.84]Okay.
[08:48.12]Should I do...
[08:53.20]repeating crossbow and then I think I need like a parry shield or something okay I'm gonna get destroyed alright talismans are really important I'm taking this one this is one of my items I don't care it's just a free 20 physical damage negation I'm taking it that's my first item it's just like why would you not take that literally the best talisman in the whole game
[09:26.00]I don't think I'm also going to take this one, too.
[09:28.22]No, that's already two out of five.
[09:32.28]What about, no, let me do weapons first.
[09:34.26]Shit.
[09:35.62]It's so funny because me and Sturf talked for like the last week about this.
[09:39.17]Every time we talk, we say, hey, dude, did you pick what you were going to do yet?
[09:42.41]We both go, no, I have no idea.
[09:57.73]Alright, I think I know what I want to do for a weapon.
[10:01.84]I've got to pick at least one decent weapon in case the whole thing falls apart.
[10:05.54]So, if I'm going to do madness and that laser spell.
[10:09.04]Madness and the laser spell?
[10:11.18]Then that means I'm going faith.
[10:13.38]If I'm going faith, that means I should do faith dex to get the extra casting speed.
[10:18.06]Okay, that makes sense to me.
[10:19.34]Faith, dex.
[10:20.50]What's a good faith dex weapon?
[10:28.75]Just go on Reddit and find the most optimal build possible.
[10:32.27]Just fucking do it.
[10:41.20]I've made that decision.
[10:42.66]Even if it sucks, I don't even care.
[10:44.04]Who cares?
[10:44.40]It's just for fun anyways.
[10:46.66]Alright, here we go.
[10:47.36]Where is it?
[10:48.98]It's a talisman, right?
[10:51.22]What slot is it in?
[10:51.94]It's over here.
[10:54.83]Oh, weapon arts also count as a slot too.
[10:59.50]Now we're going to keep it easy.
[11:04.28]We're going.
[11:07.21]Done.
[11:10.39]Alright, what about like the the flame of frenzy where you just go like?
[11:16.12]Is that terrible?
[11:28.94]Not really.
[11:29.42]It's kind of meh.
[11:30.02]It's good for... It's good for posture damage.
[11:35.04]Okay, so that's... I... That... This is... Shit, I can only pick one more item!
[11:50.03]And I... I need the... The... Like, the Frenzy Seal.
[11:52.75]Alright, where are the seals?
[11:57.25]I think I ran by them already.
[12:03.39]Where's the seals?
[12:09.91]Are they just not here?
[12:13.21]Oh, it's technically ranged.
[12:14.56]Okay.
[12:14.70]Alright.
[12:16.14]Frenzied Flame Seal.
[12:20.16]Okay.
[12:20.78]So there... Let me see.
[12:21.68]How many items do I have now?
[12:26.49]That's one.
[12:28.55]Two.
[12:31.33]And then put the spells on the bar.
[12:38.19]These don't count.
[12:39.31]These don't count.
[12:39.79]They're just here, but they don't count.
[12:41.03]Where is it?
[12:42.99]Three.
[12:46.18]Four.
[12:47.26]I can pick one more item.
[12:49.62]Shit.
[12:50.04]What do I take?
[12:50.52]This is the worst build ever?
[12:53.92]What?
[12:54.14]No, it's not.
[12:55.04]Flame of Frenzy is fucking sick.
[12:58.48]I need a weapon.
[12:59.06]Alright, alright, alright.
[12:59.86]What weapon do I take?
[13:00.84]It has to be something that can scale off of faith.
[13:05.92]Maybe the lightsaber sword?
[13:10.56]One-handed.
[13:10.92]Oh shit, it does have to be one-handed.
[13:13.31]The lightsaber sword might not be bad.
[13:16.45]Oh wait, the madness spear!
[13:17.49]That's right, that's a good idea.
[13:18.51]Yeah!
[13:19.45]Yeah!
[13:21.23]I'm getting fucking hyped up.
[13:36.90]where is it so many weapons in this game oh it's here where is it where is it no no no there it is alright so this is faith decks I've got my build I'm ready
[14:03.76]This is my build.
[14:05.28]What do I need for... Okay, I need... This just scales off of faith and dex.
[14:10.13]I need 16 strength, 20 dex, 18 faith.
[14:20.71]Okay.
[14:22.91]We gotta... We gotta say 50.
[14:25.03]There's no way I can... I need mine, too.
[14:27.30]Oh, shit.
[14:27.82]Do I have enough points?
[14:29.00]We start at level 110.
[14:37.98]Alright, there's the 16 strength.
[14:38.86]I'm going to say 30 endurance.
[14:44.04]30 mind.
[14:44.47]20, 40.
[14:44.51]I still have some points to put in.
[14:50.97]What points in dex do you think?
[14:52.95]25 endurance?
[14:53.45]No, I need the extra stamina.
[14:54.67]Guys, I don't have any... I have no armor.
[14:56.93]I'm going to be so screwed.
[15:02.64]too much endurance you don't have any armor yeah but I will have armor alright 25 endurance fine alright what is he doing don't tell me but but I'll keep it in mind 25 mind what do you think 50 faith 50 faith 30 50 faith 29 decks 25 25 28 uh I think this is good
[15:32.94]Less mind.
[15:33.86]But I'm going to be casting a bunch of spells.
[15:35.22]Okay.
[15:50.39]You're going to do no spell damage?
[15:51.93]Why not?
[15:53.65]You need more?
[15:54.55]Well, I mean, I'm only 110.
[15:55.73]We can level up.
[15:56.73]That's fine.
[15:58.23]Guys, there's no rule against leveling up.
[16:00.94]We just started at 110.
[16:02.04]We're absolutely going to level up.
[16:03.60]This is like 30 or 40 levels before the recommended DLC level.
[16:06.96]We'll be fine.
[16:07.36]You can find armor pretty quickly.
[16:13.35]What are the rules?
[16:14.73]Here are the rules.
[16:16.34]We both start at 110.
[16:18.20]We have to pick five items.
[16:20.00]And that's every talisman in the game.
[16:21.50]That's every weapon in the game.
[16:22.60]And that is every spell in the game.
[16:25.34]We have to choose five.
[16:26.71]I could pick five weapons if I really wanted to.
[16:28.55]I'm not going to do that.
[16:29.73]This build is bad.
[16:31.53]It's going to be hard.
[16:32.11]It's going to be fun.
[16:32.71]I don't know.
[16:33.19]It doesn't matter.
[16:34.33]With this, with Vikespear, I'll be alright.
[16:37.90]Can you respec?
[16:38.56]We can respec as many times as we want.
[16:41.21]We have a bingo board.
[16:43.11]We have to get bingo.
[16:44.77]We both are going to be able to claim squares.
[16:46.51]If somebody claims a square, you cannot claim that square.
[16:50.70]So if I claim, let's say, just for the sake of telling you what is possible, let's just say...
[16:57.47]Kill, uh, Malenia, or whatever is a square.
[17:01.47]If Ster does that before I do, I cannot do that.
[17:07.24]That is off limits.
[17:08.32]I cannot claim it.
[17:09.26]I can try to block them, like tic-tac-toe style.
[17:12.32]Uh, I got this idea from the, if you guys saw Fast 50, that Ludwig, uh, the speedrunning thing that Ludwig put on.
[17:20.55]They did this.
[17:22.09]Except, I mean, ours, the one we have here is really kind of fucked up.
[17:26.00]It's kind of more like jokey and more for fun.
[17:28.22]But I actually got, um, with StarZeroChris, I got a lot of advice from, uh, from StarZeroChris.
[17:34.73]And it was like, oh, shit, thanks for, like, helping out.
[17:37.59]Uh he gave some good resources and let us know kind of what we shouldn't maybe shouldn't be doing but uh it was it was pretty cool.
[17:43.59]They do this by the way. Uh- bingo brawlers. I'll make sure- I'm gonna get- I'm gonna get their Twitch channels uh when we're done with this and like shout them all out and stuff because it's really really awesome.
[17:52.59]If you think this is cool there are two clowns doing this right now.
[17:56.59]I assure you that the bingo brawlers do this all the time and they do all kinds of cool shit so I want to make sure I get their channels linked and everything.
[18:07.10]Alright, so that's kind of how it works.
[18:08.88]We're not showing the board yet because we can't spoil that because it's very important.
[18:12.18]We do like a 3, 2, 1 countdown and go.
[18:14.16]Start from the same place.
[18:15.50]What's important right now is this build.
[18:20.31]Ow, my arm!
[18:21.37]Are you alright?
[18:23.21]I'm like surrounded by fucking wires.
[18:25.37]That just hurt my fucking elbow.
[18:28.11]Alright.
[18:32.17]I think this is alright because if I get... I can get dex to 50.
[18:38.12]You know, I don't need more than 50 Viger.
[18:39.96]I don't need more than 25 Miner.
[18:41.40]I might need a little bit more Endurance, but this is a good starter.
[18:43.24]I think this is fine.
[18:43.88]16 strength to be able to use Vike in one hand.
[18:57.88]Is he freaking out as much as I am?
[19:00.40]He's gonna have like rivers of blood and it's gonna be a disaster.
[19:06.07]Alright, we can respect as many times as we want.
[19:07.79]I'm doing this.
[19:08.77]I can respect a thousand times.
[19:13.75]I don't know.
[19:14.19]Oh wait, we have to like, I have to make my character's face.
[19:29.54]This is more important than the items, honestly.
[19:58.97]Does anybody make a normal FromSoftware character?
[20:02.23]Does anybody?
[20:15.74]Well, I'm going to be Madness, so I have like the Madness eyes, right?
[20:34.23]I think that's alright.
[20:35.09]No, no, no, no.
[21:09.57]I want to try to like pull his whole face in.
[21:39.94]Hold on, I need to take the hair off.
[22:00.46]I gotta like it like this, honestly.
[22:16.81]Beautiful, piercing blue eyes.
[22:18.57]That's a good one.
[23:00.38]Hold on.
[23:21.09]I want to do this.
[23:24.85]Yep.
[23:25.55]Much better.
[23:48.90]Hold on, I gotta make the guy in the front of the warheads.
[23:51.38]Hold on a second.
[23:51.82]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[23:54.46]This is the guy in the warheads package.
[23:57.74]It's like, holy shit, so much madness!
[24:00.03]Oh, it's so sour!
[24:01.63]Madness flavor.
[24:04.79]Perfect.
[24:07.25]It's yellow, right?
[24:15.62]It's kind of like that, isn't it?
[24:17.48]It's kind of like that.
[24:20.48]Or is it like this?
[24:27.53]I think it's this one.
[24:32.93]14?
[24:32.95]You think it's 14?
[24:33.53]Yeah, it's definitely 14.
[24:34.51]I don't know.
[24:39.76]This one feels more like animated somehow.
[24:44.20]It's white?
[24:46.76]The warhead dude's hair is white?
[24:49.02]No, it's not.
[25:02.82]Oh my god.
[25:03.56]Is that good enough?
[25:06.41]No, it's definitely blonde.
[25:07.69]I've seen it.
[25:13.97]Yeah, it's like this.
[25:14.97]And I'm going to do that other one.
[25:17.51]Yeah, it's this one.
[25:18.37]This is okay.
[25:18.81]We're good.
[25:19.29]We're good.
[25:19.55]We're good.
[25:20.01]This is it.
[25:20.31]This is it.
[25:20.57]Alright, I'm done.
[25:23.21]I think I'm done.
[25:27.08]Yep.
[25:29.40]Okay.
[25:32.48]Good.
[25:38.97]Dude, I have the sourest... I've got the sourest talisman.
[25:41.82]Okay.
[25:42.90]Let me just, like, go practice.
[25:44.84]I just want to, like, just swing the sword and shit.
[25:47.04]Because he has white hair.
[25:51.82]It's fine.
[25:53.46]Alright.
[25:53.80]What is the moveset on this thing like?
[25:55.08]It's fucking loud.
[25:57.56]I got to turn that down.
[26:04.33]Okay.
[26:04.69]That's better.
[26:05.07]Okay.
[26:06.49]Okay.
[26:07.90]So it's like a big spear.
[26:09.91]Doesn't have a crazy, uh... It does.
[26:11.85]This is so loud still.
[26:14.75]Hold on a second.
[26:19.35]Why is it so loud?
[26:22.71]Okay.
[26:25.69]Alright, it's actually pretty good.
[26:29.71]It's slow though.
[26:35.76]That's pretty slow.
[26:43.75]Holy shit, dude!
[26:44.91]Snap into a Slim Jim!
[26:48.34]That's a different company, but you understand the idea.
[26:56.26]Okay.
[27:01.37]I think I'm ready.
[27:02.57]I think I'm ready.
[27:07.19]Should we do the reveal?
[27:08.03]Should we do the reveal with Ster?
[27:10.17]By the way, we don't... Five items is just what we can pick at the beginning.
[27:13.83]If you find something, you're free to do whatever the hell you want with it.
[27:17.31]You are completely free for it.
[27:19.08]You can do anything you want.
[27:20.38]But just this beginning, we have to pick these items.
[27:23.12]I think we're good.
[27:27.68]The Erdtree Seal is better than the Frenzy Flame Seal.
[27:33.20]Is it?
[27:33.96]For boosting Frenzy Flame incantations?
[27:41.76]Yes.
[27:43.64]Is that true?
[27:47.44]Why is the Frenzy Flame Seal in the game?
[27:51.12]It scales better.
[27:52.02]The boost is meaningless.
[28:01.86]Only at very high faith.
[28:07.67]You look kind of like the sniper from Team Fortress.
[28:13.46]This scales with everything.
[28:15.14]Alright.
[28:15.38]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28:16.16]That's right.
[28:16.42]That's right.
[28:16.82]That's good call.
[28:17.30]Good call.
[28:19.68]Urge reseal is what I'm going to use.
[28:20.95]That's true.
[28:23.75]Because I'm not putting points into, like, strength and int and... Wait, are you fucking with me?
[28:34.03]Are you fucking with me?
[28:38.69]Check the scale.
[28:39.21]I got 242 versus...
[28:45.22]243.
[28:45.32]It's one point.
[28:49.78]It's only one point.
[28:53.27]God Slayer is better.
[28:54.25]259.
[28:54.27]I can't.
[28:56.69]This is illegal.
[29:02.99]257 is Godslayer.
[29:04.39]243, 250.
[29:05.83]Yeah, but wouldn't this be... What is the Frenzy Flame?
[29:11.44]Is it 10%?
[29:11.80]Because wouldn't 10% of 240 something be like higher?
[29:16.34]260 or something?
[29:17.70]Godslayer is optimum.
[29:18.96]The Frenzy Flame passive is better.
[29:22.58]Yeah.
[29:23.08]I'm going to keep the Frenzy Flame.
[29:24.10]I've made my decision.
[29:24.94]I'm going to tell Ster.
[29:25.76]I'm ready to go.
[29:26.34]Okay.
[29:29.78]Hello there.
[29:30.20]Hi-ya!
[29:32.75]Uh, are you ready to talk about what you have chosen?
[29:37.42]Yes.
[29:38.04]Okay.
[29:38.38]Pretty much just finished.
[29:39.40]I just finished too.
[29:40.56]Yeah.
[29:40.82]Okay.
[29:41.22]Okay.
[29:41.86]Alright.
[29:42.20]Do you want to tell me first about your character?
[29:45.74]Sure.
[29:47.48]Uh, so I decided to go with, uh, the, uh, logo, uh, packaging of the, uh, Warheads, uh, candy brand.
[29:57.52]I'm doing a Frenzy Flame build.
[30:00.24]I have the Frenzy Flame.
[30:02.62]I have the Frenzy Flame seal and I have the, uh, Frenzy Flame explosion out of your eyes.
[30:08.82]I also have Vike's spear and I got that 20% damage talisman.
[30:15.78]I was not listening what I was opening up your stream to look at your character and it all flew over my head and I have a freeze frame of your face where you seem very excited about the character okay but can you see what I have uh yeah yeah yeah people saying turn you up I can't turn you up any higher than you already are um
[30:45.05]Really?
[30:45.35]Am I really that quiet?
[30:46.50]I don't know why you're this quiet.
[30:48.62]At least I'm... It's alright, though.
[30:50.52]Guys, but... It's not alright.
[30:52.22]It's not alright.
[30:52.78]Turn me up.
[30:53.42]You're a 200% on Discord.
[30:59.41]Okay, what if I do this?
[31:02.52]Okay.
[31:03.54]Uh, so here's very important for, very important, very important, very important, very important.
[31:07.23]I've said that like a thousand times.
[31:09.03]So one thing that we, yeah, see, I've got, I got Vikespear.
[31:13.61]Take a look at that.
[31:14.71]Yeah.
[31:14.93]You think they're going to beat this guy?
[31:17.87]Oh, what's that?
[31:18.33]Excuse me.
[31:19.79]Uh, dink.
[31:21.67]Oh, what's that?
[31:22.13]Excuse me.
[31:27.21]That's very powerful.
[31:28.09]You have rivers of blood, don't you?
[31:31.39]I go over what I'm doing.
[31:32.41]What are you doing?
[31:35.87]As we talked about, I have the Radon's Lion Greatbow.
[31:40.43]Right.
[31:41.51]I got the arrows, which I counted as a thing.
[31:44.43]I've got the Scorpion Stinger's dagger.
[31:50.44]Oh, for the rot build up.
[31:52.08]Okay.
[31:53.12]And then I've got Shard of Alexander and lowers FP of skills.
[31:57.84]Okay.
[32:00.42]Okay.
[32:01.72]I like your hair by the way yeah I made I made the warheads uh kid whatever it is I did not remember to respect my stats though I gotta do that I did okay you let me know when you're ready for us to reveal the bingo board and and get this started okay I'll be like like 10 seconds okay
[32:25.70]Maybe like 20 seconds.
[32:27.10]In 20 seconds, you're going to be ready to reveal the board.
[32:28.76]And then remember, we... The whole point is... It's 25 spots on this board.
[32:37.19]We're doing this twice.
[32:38.87]25 spots on the board.
[32:40.63]Whoever claims a space, the other person cannot claim that space.
[32:45.85]It is done.
[32:48.19]Yes.
[32:48.79]We're only doing... We're in the middle of the same thing, and he beats me to it, I'm a loser.
[32:52.90]Exactly.
[32:53.24]Exactly.
[32:54.82]And we're not doing any weird bingo stuff where it's like, oh, it's like the four corners.
[32:58.04]No, no, no, no.
[32:58.88]It's just five in a row, horizontal, diagonal, or vertical.
[33:09.44]Why did you finally turn into the Ghostbusters librarian?
[33:12.85]Why am I quiet?
[33:15.15]I don't know.
[33:16.81]But all I know is we got one.
[33:19.72]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[33:20.80]I really want to hear this out.
[33:22.68]Because usually, shut up.
[33:23.94]See, this is what I mean.
[33:25.52]I'm usually talking to people in Discord, and then they talk over me, and it's like I'm not even there because I'm so quiet.
[33:30.02]But you have me turned up, but have I never sounded quiet to you before relative to your other things?
[33:34.95]No, you sound okay to me, by the way.
[33:36.77]Oh, I didn't pay attention to a single thing you said for the Frenzy Flame build.
[33:40.41]You just said you weren't even paying attention to me.
[33:42.15]Okay, so do you have like a separate audio channel on your OBS for your Discord?
[33:47.11]I think you are fine.
[33:49.51]I want to be better.
[33:51.29]Okay, just sing the ABCs.
[33:55.91]A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P. You are almost peaking the microphone on my OBS.
[34:03.58]You're fine.
[34:06.34]Okay.
[34:06.74]The Ster is quiet.
[34:08.44]So, shall we reveal the bingo board?
[34:13.71]Are you ready?
[34:14.43]I'm ready.
[34:15.74]I'm ready to reveal the board.
[34:18.13]Okay.
[34:18.73]Revealing the board right now.
[34:20.41]Okay, pulling the curtain down.
[34:22.07]Okay, so here are all the things that we have to do.
[34:25.51]Okay, we haven't really looked at what order these things are in yet.
[34:31.75]So, like, you know, hardcore Souls things like kill a boss blindfolded or fart into a lighter while screaming for the Frenzied Flame.
[34:42.46]It's really anything.
[34:45.63]It could be anything.
[34:46.59]It could be anything.
[34:47.25]By the way, we both have a secret slime action.
[34:51.86]True.
[34:52.32]We do have the secret slime action.
[34:54.48]Do you want to just read across all of them?
[34:56.26]Why?
[34:56.54]Okay.
[34:57.12]Why don't we reveal these and talk?
[34:58.38]Alright.
[34:58.64]So kill a boss.
[34:59.45]You read the top row.
[35:00.47]I'll read the next row.
[35:01.57]We'll split it up.
[35:02.63]Kill a boss blindfolded is very self-explanatory.
[35:05.39]You just have to, you can't, you have to have something covering your eyes while you fight a boss.
[35:08.97]Any boss in the game doesn't matter what it is.
[35:11.52]Fart into a lighter while screaming for the Frenzied Flame.
[35:15.35]I think that's also pretty self-explanatory.
[35:17.15]You fart into a lighter while you scream for the Frenzied Flame.
[35:20.41]It's pretty simple.
[35:22.73]Neither one of us is doing that and it's gonna come down to that spot probably for something and it's gonna be a fucking disaster.
[35:28.54]Cross one million runes held.
[35:32.34]This means you just have to hold a million runes at some point.
[35:37.36]I think we're less likely to do that than fart into a lighter.
[35:40.93]I think you seriously underestimate how good I am at this game and what I'm going to be going for.
[35:45.86]Okay.
[35:48.44]I don't have a plan.
[35:49.22]Apparently you have a plan.
[35:50.42]I have one plan and I'm not going to tell you what it is yet.
[35:54.65]Okay.
[35:56.03]Okay, kill a pot with pots.
[35:58.28]That means that the pots in the DLC, the people in the jars, well, it could be any of those, right?
[36:04.87]Any pot that is a pot enemy.
[36:07.05]Any pot.
[36:07.73]As long as you kill a pot enemy with pot items, you can have that.
[36:19.26]She just brought a couple lighters.
[36:22.80]The secret slime action, which we- It's so funny, I love how Holly is assuming I'm just doing this one.
[36:28.65]She's like, oh, I got two different lighters for you.
[36:32.39]If I'm feeling in the mood, I have to run to the kitchen and grab one.
[36:35.96]No, that's just on there for a fucking joke.
[36:37.94]No one's doing it.
[36:38.76]Okay.
[36:40.38]Secret slime action, we both have told.
[36:42.62]By the way, there's mods and there are people there.
[36:45.64]We got a committee watching right now to keep track of all this shit.
[36:50.30]So secret slime action, I have told this committee something that I think Stirr is going to do over the course of this bingo run.
[36:57.71]If he does it, then it's like alert, alert.
[37:00.95]Stirr did the thing.
[37:01.79]I get that spot.
[37:03.43]Exactly the same
[37:05.37]on Ster's end so if I do whatever Ster told the committee if I do it then he gets to take that space yep you can go and take the next role get the wandering nobles to plus 10 and they they must last hit a boss I still don't know where these guys are uh but that one pretty self-explanatory um I think getting them to plus 10 in general is going to be a whole ordeal
[37:30.65]uh solve opponent's painting that's right so so how you find paintings in the game it's paintings of locations we took screenshots ahead of time we both have one we haven't looked at them yet of a certain area in the game and then you have to go in that area and like match the painting uh kill ancient dragon man with a dragon I don't know any any way you want to do that
[37:54.85]he's my favorite character in the game by the way ancient dragon man is is awesome uh best dressed at one hour 15 minute voted by panel of judges uh which Jerma by the way I want to throw it in now he paid them to pick him so like when he wins it was a collusion I'm just telling you right I don't have any clothes yet and I don't know where any good armor even is so I'm gonna look like so I don't know uh yeah and then die to market pretty pretty makes sense
[38:23.19]Find an illusory wall.
[38:24.05]This one's easy.
[38:24.65]You just got to find one.
[38:25.53]There's a lot in the game.
[38:27.05]Take a screenshot of any enemy and edit your face onto them.
[38:31.35]Again.
[38:35.59]Kill the first boss in Binding of Isaac.
[38:39.55]I mean, I just killed the first boss in The Binding of Isaac.
[38:41.31]Doesn't sound too difficult, I don't think.
[38:43.46]Kill two Everjail bosses.
[38:44.70]We all know what those are.
[38:46.32]Imbibe St.
[38:47.06]Trina's Nectar 10 times.
[38:48.42]You have to die 10 times there to St.
[38:50.58]Trina.
[38:51.90]Defeat any DLC remembrance boss without rolling.
[38:54.81]This is literally impossible.
[38:55.77]I don't think any of us are going to do this.
[38:58.01]I'm going to do that one.
[38:59.25]I have a plan.
[39:00.43]Equip four talismans.
[39:01.83]I'm cheating.
[39:02.67]I already got two.
[39:03.91]Oh, fuck.
[39:04.67]You already have two.
[39:06.09]I didn't know it was on this board.
[39:07.71]Oh, shit.
[39:08.53]Okay.
[39:09.39]get through the laser zone untouched you guys know the laser zone which is the the running path you have to do to get to where St. Trina is with the boats where they have a whole bunch of laser snake ball things yeah like storming normandy you have to get through that and you can't be hit by one and we are we had the gentleman's agreement that you cannot use a shield either you just cannot take any damage through that run
[39:36.29]uh kill lord of Frenzied Flame uh again we do have a bunch of uh waypoints already so we have the mansion so you don't have to go through the whole like uh chaos mist walking stroll area you just have to get to the mansion kill the Frenzied Flame die 20 times you gonna gonna get that one I have a I have a plan very early looking at this uh
[40:03.79]Maybe.
[40:04.27]Okay.
[40:05.65]Kill any DLC dungeon boss with no emotion.
[40:09.76]That means no happiness, no sadness, no rage, no like, oh, what the, what the, what the heck, man?
[40:16.56]Like, no, no, no, no.
[40:17.18]You just have to sit there without, you have to be stone-faced.
[40:19.39]You just sit there without a single fucking emotion at all.
[40:22.97]Yep.
[40:23.43]Told him that's my normal stream, so I got that one.
[40:26.65]Kill a Furnace Golem.
[40:27.53]That's just a huge pain in the ass, but it's very doable.
[40:30.53]You just have to be patient.
[40:32.74]Most Crunchies at one hour.
[40:34.08]These are the runes.
[40:36.28]The Rune Crunchies.
[40:37.54]Now, it's not how many times you've taken them.
[40:39.52]It's just how many you have in your inventory by amount of runes they are.
[40:43.28]So, like, Shadow Realm runes.
[40:45.68]What are they even called?
[40:46.38]I think they're called Crunchies.
[40:51.18]What are they called?
[40:52.62]Runes of... What are they even called?
[40:54.84]I don't remember.
[40:56.20]I've been calling them crunchies for like 10 years.
[40:57.83]I don't even know.
[40:58.83]Skadootree runes.
[41:00.19]Yeah.
[41:01.15]Kill three Tibia Mariners.
[41:02.67]This could be any of them, anywhere in the game.
[41:04.53]And then obtain five remembrances.
[41:07.42]So I am going to be the color of red and you are going to be... Are we counting remembrances as crunchies?
[41:14.77]I mean, I feel like... No, we are not.
[41:17.03]Okay.
[41:17.59]So you can use your remembrance crunchies.
[41:19.91]Only the like actual crunchies, not remembrance.
[41:23.96]Okay.
[41:25.14]Okay.
[41:26.38]So with that being said, are we ready to begin this Elden Ring bingo playthrough?
[41:34.82]Um... Are we ready?
[41:38.26]Let me think.
[41:39.60]I think we're ready.
[41:40.26]Okay.
[41:41.89]If we are ready... The thing that's important is we're not going to have the bingo up all the time.
[41:47.53]We don't know... We're not going to be in direct communication of what we're doing.
[41:51.25]So if I'm in the middle of something and he has beaten it, we might screw each other over, but...
[41:56.23]Yeah, well, I plan on showing it and looking at it every, you know, at least every 10 to 15 minutes.
[42:01.51]And we have people monitoring it right now to keep us, you know, honest.
[42:06.59]So, yeah.
[42:07.74]Okay.
[42:08.24]I think we could do with like a countdown.
[42:10.64]Would you like to do a countdown?
[42:13.80]Um, sure.
[42:14.68]I've got a timer on mine, so let me hide the bingo real quick.
[42:19.76]Okay, hide the bingo.
[42:21.94]Three?
[42:22.26]Yeah, let's do five.
[42:24.09]Three, two, one.
[42:26.13]Okay, mute.
[42:28.17]Mute.
[42:37.70]I can't, I can't play the game.
[42:40.74]What the fuck?
[42:41.22]Hey, my game doesn't work.
[42:44.10]Why am I player two?
[42:51.59]This is fucking a disaster.
[42:52.97]I think I have to abandon this.
[42:54.23]I have to abandon it.
[42:54.85]What?
[42:55.03]I have to abandon this one.
[43:01.13]Oh my fucking God.
[43:01.95]What?
[43:02.23]I am actually fucking pissed right now.
[43:03.57]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[43:07.52]I was so ready to get this fucking square, and I think I crashed my computer.
[43:15.48]Oh, it's because I have a PlayStation 5 controller, and it's like, we don't know what that controller is.
[43:20.56]Oh my God, I'm going to lose.
[43:24.04]I got to get out.
[43:24.44]I got to get out of this.
[43:25.38]I got to get out of this.
[43:26.35]Oh my God, thank you so much.
[43:28.15]Xbox controller.
[43:33.05]Is he doing this?
[43:33.71]Is he doing this one right now?
[43:41.26]I have to fucking pivot.
[43:42.48]I have to pivot.
[43:42.96]I gotta pivot right now.
[43:47.26]I gotta pivot.
[43:47.70]I have to pivot.
[43:48.10]I have to pivot.
[43:48.52]I have to pivot.
[43:50.13]I gotta pivot.
[43:50.53]I gotta pivot.
[43:56.29]I couldn't use the keyboard either.
[43:58.78]For some reason, I had to like... I'm just gonna go data market right now.
[44:11.22]Shit!
[44:12.12]I... Quick, get the lighter!
[44:16.10]Wait, wait, where is... Where is this?
[44:18.88]Where's Die to Margit?
[44:19.88]Okay, I... I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[44:29.73]God damn it!
[44:35.95]God damn it!
[44:37.61]I was playing as the second player!
[44:45.36]You couldn't even beat a basement one boss?
[44:47.98]No, I was going to be able to do it.
[44:49.38]It would.
[44:49.66]Oh, hold on.
[44:51.18]I actually need that.
[44:53.54]Alright.
[44:54.08]Where am I going?
[44:56.62]I'm so rattled right now.
[45:04.07]I know what I'm going to do here.
[45:05.45]Okay, I can pivot.
[45:06.07]I can pivot.
[45:06.47]I can pivot big time.
[45:07.23]Get this out of my way.
[45:09.71]Get this down.
[45:10.05]Get this down.
[45:10.65]Get this down.
[45:11.97]I got like shit surrounding me.
[45:13.55]Okay.
[45:15.63]We're good.
[45:16.17]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[45:17.13]I know what I'm doing.
[45:18.65]I know what I'm doing.
[45:28.61]Why am I even doing that?
[45:29.55]I don't care about that.
[45:33.94]Okay.
[45:34.80]Okay, here's the... No, don't die here.
[45:37.30]Don't die here.
[45:46.52]It's too much pressure.
[45:52.96]Okay.
[45:53.60]I'm going to die to Margit 20 fucking times.
[45:57.47]Is that going to take too long?
[46:01.05]What?
[46:01.43]He did it?
[46:01.81]Okay.
[46:02.41]He just beat the first boss in Binding of Isaac.
[46:05.33]I'm way ahead of him.
[46:12.83]Okay.
[46:13.87]If I die to... Skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.
[46:16.32]Come on, come on, kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me.
[46:28.31]Good, good, good.
[46:29.31]Come on, come on, come on.
[46:30.79]Jump off the cliff.
[46:31.51]No, no, I have to die to Margit.
[46:33.20]Margit has to kill me, not jump off the cliff.
[46:41.06]Okay, I'm gonna... How much damage do I do to Margit?
[46:45.06]Okay, this is gonna be... Where's my mouse?
[46:58.29]Alright, claiming die to Margit right now.
[47:02.01]And now... I'm gonna claim another fucking square.
[47:06.12]Just you wait.
[47:06.88]Check this shit out.
[47:17.71]Blindfold.
[47:20.45]Where's blindfold?
[47:21.25]Top left.
[47:22.22]I can get it right now.
[47:22.86]Okay, here we go.
[47:23.32]I just have to press triangle.
[47:40.31]I don't know where he is.
[47:49.55]Where is he?
[47:50.17]I don't know how I'm locked onto him.
[47:56.54]Shit, I gotta... I think this is a potion, I think.
[48:08.80]Oh, I hit him.
[48:11.80]I hit him, I hit him, I hit him.
[48:14.58]Where did... Okay.
[48:16.60]I hear noises still.
[48:19.07]Oh, he's at 50%.
[48:19.65]He's at 50%.
[48:20.13]50%.
[48:20.31]I think I'm killing him.
[48:29.71]Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.
[48:41.16]Did I get him?
[48:45.48]I got him.
[48:45.78]I got him.
[48:46.02]I got him.
[48:46.30]I got him.
[48:47.30]I got him.
[48:47.56]I got him.
[48:47.84]I got him.
[48:48.30]I win.
[48:53.33]Okay, now... Where does that put me here?
[48:55.18]Okay, I could go down here.
[49:00.50]Okay.
[49:00.72]How many times have I died?
[49:27.17]I think that's two.
[49:29.21]I think that's two.
[49:33.89]That's two.
[49:36.59]I got two squares.
[49:37.37]He doesn't fucking got shit.
[49:42.01]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[49:43.38]Okay.
[49:44.48]I think, am I good?
[49:45.06]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[49:46.86]I think I'm good.
[49:48.52]That's, this is three.
[49:54.38]Get the lighter ready.
[49:56.38]Um...
[49:59.28]Where are the boys?
[50:00.35]I think I know where they are.
[50:03.13]I think I know where the boys are.
[50:12.45]Defeat DLC boss without rolling.
[50:13.93]I'm going to be so screwed there.
[50:16.81]I got to get to Santorino.
[50:19.45]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[50:20.88]But then I need... Okay, I have one remembrance right now.
[50:24.28]Don't stream hop.
[50:26.40]Okay, I know what I'm doing.
[50:30.98]Alright, to get down to Santrina, you need to go... I think it's through here.
[50:36.05]Alright, I'm on my way.
[50:38.27]I'm on my way.
[50:38.67]I'm in DLC right now.
[50:50.31]Also, what about... I gotta get some more, like, items.
[50:53.64]Shut the fuck up.
[50:54.30]I got this right now.
[51:00.77]Where's Furnace Golem?
[51:01.63]To the bottom.
[51:14.45]Alright, everybody pray for me.
[51:34.81]That was such an absolute dog shit fucking RNG and everybody here knows it.
[51:44.00]What the fuck?
[51:44.66]I know how to play!
[52:06.48]Yeah, we don't have any skidoo fragments.
[52:09.18]We'd have to go get them.
[52:10.96]I think I know where some are.
[52:20.62]It's a bad spot to fight him.
[52:45.17]Thank goodness.
[53:02.62]That's not gonna hit me, right?
[53:09.12]Get off of this ledge!
[53:23.39]Get away from the ledge!
[53:29.75]This is going to screw me so bad and everybody knows it.
[53:32.97]You know how these work.
[53:45.79]I jumped!
[53:46.09]I double jumped and it didn't work!
[53:50.01]Alright, so calm down.
[53:50.67]It's fine.
[54:08.44]Thank you.
[54:40.54]Hey, what the?
[54:46.88]This ledge is so fucking annoying.
[55:03.26]Alright, just one more time.
[55:18.08]And this square is mine.
[55:36.93]I just noticed something.
[55:37.63]He just got... Okay, I gotta calm down.
[55:45.40]I gotta pivot right now.
[55:50.84]I picked the longest possible thing to do.
[55:54.21]I picked the absolute longest thing you could possibly do.
[56:00.78]But I have to see it through now.
[56:05.88]This is the longest thing I could have possibly done.
[56:27.74]He's going to get bingo.
[56:29.16]I know what I have to do.
[56:43.37]Boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[56:44.65]Don't freak out.
[56:54.76]Use the charge attack.
[57:00.52]Oh, I had no stamina left.
[57:05.83]I'm telling you, The Binding of Isaac thing just completely screwed me.
[57:08.79]It completely screwed me so bad.
[57:13.75]Whoever got that middle square was going to have such an advantage in this first round.
[57:24.63]Don't worry.
[57:26.67]Guys, everyone thinks it's going to be over.
[57:28.47]It's not over.
[57:38.70]Uh, to be able to do St. Trina, if you're able to get there, you have to kill the Putrid Knight.
[57:44.66]Ster is not willing to be able to do that.
[57:46.66]It's his least favorite boss in the whole game.
[57:48.87]It's going to take him an hour and a half to do that.
[57:50.43]I'll beat that in fucking five tries.
[58:04.74]Get off the fucking horse!
[58:19.02]That's it?
[58:28.41]I'm glad that I did that.
[58:29.89]Because, yeah, I did a whole... Oh, shit.
[58:31.85]I just, like, fucked up.
[58:32.71]I just fucked something up.
[58:34.97]No, I didn't.
[58:35.21]I'm good.
[58:40.38]Okay.
[58:42.34]I gotta go now.
[58:48.06]I gotta get down to Santrina right now.
[58:49.74]What is this still doing on?
[58:53.22]Why'd you just pick all these random squares?
[58:54.64]I don't know, dude, I freaked out.
[58:56.69]I absolutely just freaked the fuck out.
[58:58.01]I lost The Binding of Isaac thing and then I was like, I'm gonna go die to Margit and then I fucked up.
[59:02.13]I saw- then I saw the- the golem and I was like, I have to kill the golem and it took me like fucking 15 minutes.
[59:07.23]Okay, I know what he's doing.
[59:08.81]I'm gonna- I gotta go now.
[59:11.33]Alright, St.
[59:11.81]Trina.
[59:12.11]St- How do I get down there?
[59:14.55]I think it's like... You gotta get down to the coast.
[59:22.24]Let me go get a fragment first because this is going to be hard.
[59:29.82]Those every jail but bosses are going to be easier.
[59:31.58]Yeah, but he might be doing it right now.
[59:33.18]You know what?
[59:36.04]Yeah, wait, wait, wait.
[59:36.86]I might be able to snipe him.
[59:38.46]I might be able to snipe it.
[59:47.05]I think I have to just get down to Santrina.
[59:50.21]Oh my god, he's gonna win right now.
[59:52.78]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[59:54.28]He's already going to win.
[59:57.20]The Binding of Isaac thing just completely screwed me.
[59:59.44]I should have just killed Margit and went down to Santrina.
[60:02.07]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[60:07.49]I think I lose.
[60:09.11]I have to block him.
[60:10.05]I know, but I don't know how to get down to Santrina.
[60:12.23]How do I get down to Santrina?
[60:17.51]It's been like three weeks as I played this game.
[60:22.73]I think you have to go through here.
[60:29.95]It's here, I think.
[60:30.69]OK, yeah, I think I know where to go.
[60:35.13]You need to get the lighter.
[60:39.49]How did he already take a screenshot and edit it onto somebody already?
[60:43.78]I should have done that too.
[60:47.44]Hey, don't worry.
[60:47.96]I'll get him on the next one.
[60:49.00]I'll get him on the next one.
[60:49.72]Don't worry.
[60:50.08]We're going to do this at least a few times.
[60:51.18]I'm going to get him on the next one.
[60:57.78]I... Seriously, he hates Putrid Knight.
[61:01.70]Putrid Knight is a boss I can handle.
[61:03.12]I'll be fucking fine.
[61:04.02]I just have to remember how to get down there.
[61:08.62]I'm pretty sure you just have to... It's around here.
[61:10.68]I don't know where to go.
[61:13.91]Is the board going to change?
[61:14.65]Yes.
[61:16.24]This is round one of at least two or three, at least.
[61:20.96]You got to stick to a single plan.
[61:23.23]Yeah, my plan was kill the first boss in Binding of Isaac and then kill two Evergeil bosses.
[61:28.35]We were going to do the same row.
[61:30.09]We had the exact same idea.
[61:35.55]I don't have any fragments right now.
[61:37.73]Are there any on the way?
[61:50.84]I think you can go this way, right?
[61:54.08]Like here?
[61:55.26]Is that the way through?
[61:55.98]I just don't remember.
[62:11.53]All the Miquella crosses have fragments?
[62:12.97]That's true.
[62:20.92]You gotta get to Mesmers.
[62:23.38]To get to Santrina?
[62:24.30]No, that's not how I did it when I played through on stream, is it?
[62:27.30]Alright, I gotta focus up because I have no idea how to get down there.
[62:35.37]So.
[62:37.59]Rushing a different line is faster.
[62:40.23]I don't think so.
[62:40.93]I have to block him.
[62:41.79]I have to block him here.
[62:43.05]But does he know how to get down to Santrina?
[62:44.93]Maybe he doesn't know either.
[62:49.44]I always thought that you like have to go this way, like through here.
[62:52.40]I actually think that is correct.
[62:55.54]Let me see if I'm wrong.
[62:57.00]I think that's correct.
[63:05.15]Although trying to beat a putrid knight with no fragments is going to be pretty hard, I think.
[63:23.69]Hey, just just gotta get good.
[63:25.67]Gotta be good.
[63:29.69]You have to break the seal.
[63:31.01]Oh, that's right.
[63:34.27]So wait, Rolana has to be dead.
[63:41.31]Oh.
[63:44.67]No, wait, that's not true.
[63:51.39]Yeah, you can get there from here, can't you?
[63:52.71]Am I insane?
[64:05.08]It's down here, right?
[64:06.36]Let me clear this so I can take a look.
[64:07.58]I want armor, so if these guys drop anything, I'm just putting it on.
[64:40.94]Can't rush either.
[64:41.74]I can't rush.
[64:48.16]And I have to absolutely game the fuck up when we get down there, by the way.
[64:55.16]Okay, I think I can just go straight through here, right?
[65:01.66]I'm pretty sure... How you doing over there?
[65:04.90]I can't fucking... You sweating a little bit?
[65:06.34]A little bit sweaty?
[65:13.44]Yeah, I... Okay, dude, my controllers didn't work in Binding of Isaac.
[65:16.76]You got that.
[65:17.68]And then I just went... I was like, I'm gonna go die to Margit.
[65:20.18]My keyboard didn't work in it either.
[65:22.04]I was trying to keyboard and that wasn't working.
[65:25.32]so you know you just gotta I am actually not I I could be a lot more unhappy right now but this is I don't think you're gonna beat this I think I'm gonna be fine here I think you're gonna get stuck I think you're gonna get stuck on future night and you're gonna be really upset about it you're gonna get really mad I don't think I'm going to I don't think so alright I need to get
[65:54.99]Where is it?
[65:56.25]You know what this reminds me of, actually?
[65:58.15]I hadn't mentioned this.
[66:00.79]I'm like just riding the horse around doing quests.
[66:03.09]I actually started like, okay, I have this like really stupid new hobby.
[66:08.03]Sure.
[66:08.91]Like it's embarrassing.
[66:10.91]You have a new hobby?
[66:12.37]Yeah.
[66:13.81]Very cool.
[66:14.78]I've been doing horseback riding once a week.
[66:18.46]Are you serious?
[66:20.24]Yeah, it's like fucking, it's lame.
[66:21.60]It's kind of stupid.
[66:23.17]What do you mean lame?
[66:23.81]Why isn't lame?
[66:25.21]I'm lame.
[66:31.65]Guys, that's not lame, but that's cool.
[66:35.45]The Knights used to do that.
[66:38.01]What is it?
[66:39.86]My secret slime action.
[66:42.40]What's your secret slime action?
[66:44.24]You said my hobby wasn't lame.
[66:54.67]You motherfucker.
[66:58.13]Go ahead and take it.
[66:59.45]Go ahead and take it.
[67:00.77]Okay.
[67:03.39]You can confirm with the mods.
[67:04.85]The plan was... It went exactly to plan.
[67:08.91]Mine was you were going to talk about PoE at least once.
[67:14.26]Oh, man.
[67:14.62]That was... That was more likely than one might think.
[67:21.18]I know.
[67:22.88]Alright.
[67:23.10]How do I...
[67:24.55]Fuck!
[67:26.00]I can't tell you what I'm doing right now because, like, it's a spoiler.
[67:29.06]Wait a minute.
[67:31.14]Where is this thing?
[67:33.68]Well, here's... I have the self-awareness to know that I'm the annoying POE guy and I feel bad about it when I bring it up.
[67:42.17]So...
[67:45.76]Uh, well, hey, may the best Elden Ring player win.
[67:50.00]Yeah, good luck.
[67:50.80]On the first of at least a few of these.
[67:52.60]This is the warm-up round.
[67:56.00]Can you slime yourself now?
[67:58.95]Oh, what the fuck?
[67:59.75]It's everywhere.
[68:00.83]I can't believe it.
[68:02.07]Can you go get the gruel out?
[68:09.89]Somebody said you're cooked.
[68:11.91]I know I'm cooked.
[68:13.83]He beat me in The Binding of Isaac.
[68:15.27]We had the same exact idea.
[68:16.75]Uh, did you... I had to reset like five times.
[68:22.15]What do you mean reset?
[68:24.21]Like in Binding of Isaac, I just kept walking into dead rooms and I realized you should pick Azazel.
[68:29.74]And then I found the boss in like two rooms.
[68:34.06]Uh... Hey, uh... Hey, so... Hey, gentlemen's... Gentlemen's handshake on this.
[68:39.20]Gentlemen's handshake.
[68:42.19]Where I know there's a way to get down to Santrina without having to get to Messmer's castle, but you need to break the spell.
[68:49.57]You have to have gotten to near the hippo to break the spell as you walk up to the castle.
[68:54.66]I don't know any other way.
[68:56.04]I feel I think I know another way.
[68:59.92]Okay, well, if you know another way, I don't know another way.
[69:02.94]I swear to God there's another way.
[69:08.94]That's cool.
[69:10.22]That's cool if you find one.
[69:14.46]I'm gonna beat you to this.
[69:15.82]Trust me on it.
[69:20.14]I don't believe you.
[69:21.36]I'll find it.
[69:22.80]Do you want to go back into your hole?
[69:24.33]No, hey, hey, good luck.
[69:25.81]Hey, good luck.
[69:26.49]Good luck with the next fucking beating the hippo, beating Rolana, beating all this shit.
[69:30.37]I'm gonna, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna kick, I'm gonna kick your butt.
[69:33.87]Well, well, hey there, mister.
[69:35.12]I'm gonna blast your bum bum.
[69:36.44]Alright, I'm muted.
[69:44.52]He doesn't know shit.
[69:45.42]I just need to get down there.
[69:46.76]I know there's another way down there.
[69:48.28]I know it.
[69:53.67]Let me take a better look down here.
[69:54.89]Because if I can get down there and put on some gear, I should be fucking fine.
[70:12.48]I have seen...
[70:15.83]Where is it?
[70:16.35]Maybe this way.
[70:20.42]You have to break that seal no matter what.
[70:22.70]That's... I don't... I think you... Oh, fuck.
[70:25.78]I think that's right.
[70:30.71]Wait a minute.
[70:35.96]Ster is a painting.
[70:37.62]Fuck this.
[70:38.30]He's gonna have- he's gonna go through all the way through Rulana and all this bullshit.
[70:41.24]I'm going the fucking next row up.
[70:42.96]I'm gonna make sure I'm the best dressed motherfucker here.
[70:44.86]I'm gonna go kill ancient dragon man.
[70:46.48]I'm gonna- what's it- where's this painting?
[70:47.76]I have this painting right here.
[70:50.66]Ster's painting... is a joke.
[70:54.79]It's a troll post, okay?
[70:57.07]Um, thank you.
[70:58.19]What?
[71:06.49]Where even is this?
[71:12.96]Where is this?
[71:17.80]Hold on, wait a second.
[71:19.20]Wait a second.
[71:20.36]Yep.
[71:21.68]I think I know exactly where this is.
[71:22.94]He didn't even give a shit.
[71:23.70]He didn't even try on this.
[71:25.21]He didn't even try.
[71:26.11]And you know how I know?
[71:27.75]Yep, I know exactly where this is.
[71:29.97]Because he told me, like, 10 minutes, 20 minutes before the stream started, I was like, hey, did you do your painting?
[71:35.83]And he was like, oh, fuck, I didn't.
[71:44.33]It's definitely right fucking here.
[71:59.06]Is this it?
[72:05.70]Is this it?
[72:06.16]No.
[72:06.58]Where is this?
[72:15.30]I have an idea.
[72:16.92]Hey, he's going to give me one of these.
[72:18.54]Check this out.
[72:35.53]Where is that?
[72:42.37]Where is that?
[72:48.25]I think that's actually right.
[72:49.17]I think it is right here.
[72:54.63]Is it right here?
[72:56.36]What cave is that?
[73:00.92]I think it's literally right here.
[73:06.23]Is it like right here?
[73:08.63]No.
[73:10.53]That's a cheating Charlie.
[73:12.34]Sending me a fucking picture like that is a cheating Charlie.
[73:16.92]Nope, this is gravel.
[73:20.49]Where's that gravel?
[73:24.49]There's no stairs.
[73:34.74]It has to be something close to one of the Graces.
[73:38.66]Sorry.
[73:39.98]We can work on it.
[73:40.56]We can work on it.
[73:41.56]I'm going to go for... Because he's got a long road ahead of him here.
[73:44.26]I'm going to make sure I got a good close.
[73:47.50]Ancient Dragon Man is... Alright.
[73:50.31]Wait, wait, wait.
[73:50.91]The Nobles.
[73:51.55]I think I know where they are.
[73:52.43]And I'll go kill Godrick or something.
[73:57.93]The Nobles are... I need to get them to plus 10.
[74:04.23]What if they just killed the boss?
[74:10.67]Four talismans.
[74:12.53]What about the bottom here?
[74:13.63]Okay, hold on.
[74:14.17]Okay, I think I know what I'm going to do.
[74:19.43]Kill any DLC dungeon boss without any emotion.
[74:22.55]Got it.
[74:39.95]I think it's going to take him like an hour to get to Reno.
[74:43.43]I have an opportunity here.
[74:48.58]I have a huge opportunity to get this done.
[74:52.80]Okay.
[74:53.92]DLC dungeon boss.
[74:55.54]Where's the first dungeon here?
[74:58.65]Is it Ons?
[75:06.41]I have to stop panicking.
[75:07.99]Just look at the map.
[75:10.07]Where's the first dungeon?
[75:12.95]Because this doesn't count.
[75:13.79]This is a mausoleum.
[75:15.15]We already said that it has to be a dungeon, boss.
[75:18.41]First dungeon.
[75:22.77]I'm going to get this fragment because, look, he's either going to beat Future Knight in an hour or not, right?
[75:40.80]Do Ancient Dragon Man get two squares at once?
[75:44.62]I just don't even know where any of this shit is.
[75:47.28]I have like a vague understanding of where stuff is, but... I don't, I don't at all.
[75:52.93]Let me get this fragment, because let me at least get one skidoo fragment.
[75:57.03]This is easy, it's just right here.
[76:02.15]Ancient Dragon Man is on the way to Saint Trino.
[76:04.70]Yeah, but I don't know like the secret special way to... I still, you still have to break the charm.
[76:22.29]I also need to pick up a bunch of runes, because he's not gonna do any of that, guaranteed.
[76:37.60]Okay.
[76:56.93]Ooh, good.
[76:57.49]Nice.
[77:03.52]honestly looking for armor okay there's a skidoo tree fragment he's gonna get to St. Trina and win now he's not
[77:24.38]Guys, me and Styr had like an hour and a half long conversation during when the DLC was.
[77:30.23]Everybody's playing it.
[77:31.35]He told me that that Putrid Knight boss is the worst.
[77:33.85]He's hated it.
[77:34.35]It's the worst boss he said he's ever played in his life.
[77:36.47]He said that I hated it every second of it.
[77:37.93]He said it wasn't fun and he hated it.
[77:39.74]He's not going to beat it.
[77:41.76]He's got a lot of pressure to beat it fast.
[77:49.20]OK, so I got that fragment.
[77:50.85]Now let me go.
[77:54.63]This way.
[77:56.03]Yeah.
[77:56.75]Towards Belorat.
[77:57.69]I think it's over here.
[77:58.27]Okay.
[78:12.94]Let me skidoo level up.
[78:20.91]Yeah, I need one more fragment and I'm good.
[78:23.65]Okay.
[78:24.49]I think there's a dungeon boss down here.
[78:31.19]And then the mariners.
[78:32.93]I know there's a mariner in... I don't fucking know where any mariners are.
[78:38.48]I just know that there's a couple in the old world.
[78:42.82]What is up here?
[78:43.36]Anything good?
[78:43.78]Anything worth getting?
[78:58.24]Hey, when's the mac and cheese stream?
[78:59.60]Uh, dude, that was like four months ago.
[79:01.10]I could kill NPCs for their drip.
[79:11.84]Where am I going?
[79:12.46]Yeah, I know about the NPC kills.
[79:22.67]But I need to get on the path to victory here.
[79:29.41]And that path to victory is... There's a dungeon boss here.
[79:31.60]I'm going to just get through it.
[79:35.48]Ancient Dragon Man is... I just... I don't know where the secret way to get to St. Trina is.
[79:39.70]And I think he's doing the long way.
[79:44.99]Mausoleum boss has good drip.
[79:47.99]That's true, but I... Am I... Okay.
[79:50.19]Okay.
[79:52.31]No, I gotta stick to something.
[79:54.43]I gotta stick to something.
[79:55.65]This is what happened.
[79:57.23]I lost my Binding of Isaac bullshit, and then I just started picking random squares to do.
[80:02.15]We gotta stay with a plan.
[80:22.24]You should get the hat.
[80:25.13]That's true.
[80:25.97]Let me go through here.
[80:28.85]Five remembrances.
[80:29.83]That's... I have margots.
[80:31.89]I could go run to get godrics.
[80:38.56]I have to change some equipment shit here.
[80:40.14]Because I'm not used to being there.
[80:42.56]There we go.
[80:47.69]There's a dungeon here somewhere.
[80:51.52]Is it here?
[80:52.06]I think it's right here.
[80:57.46]Margit doesn't have one?
[80:58.55]Oh fuck yeah, it's Godrick.
[81:01.41]Maybe I could beat the lion.
[81:02.47]If I get a chest piece, I'll go for the lion.
[81:15.24]What about Rinala's Remembrance?
[81:17.24]I'm not sure that one counts.
[81:26.90]Line doesn't have a chest piece.
[81:28.66]No, I'm saying if I get a chest piece, then I'll go try to do line.
[81:38.85]OK, yeah, here it is.
[81:46.07]Here's the thing, though.
[81:49.11]If I kill this boss.
[81:52.41]He's going to probably just go kill five Mariners.
[81:58.41]Do the mausoleum boss?
[81:59.83]Well, we made a gentleman's agreement that it has to be a dungeon boss.
[82:10.81]Okay.
[82:10.95]Let's do it.
[82:18.41]You gotta take them for the team and fart into a lighter?
[82:21.37]Dude, uh... What's the win condition of me farting into a lighter?
[82:26.34]There is no win condition.
[82:27.58]He took the whole middle row.
[82:31.39]You just want to see me fart into a lighter, which is fine.
[82:34.39]I think this is off.
[82:50.69]How much time do we have, by the way?
[82:53.03]When did we start?
[82:53.97]How much time do I have for the crunchies?
[82:55.11]Because I have to go get some.
[83:04.40]40 minutes have passed.
[83:07.70]There's like a hero's rune somewhere.
[83:11.04]Fuck.
[83:16.22]I'm so bad at this.
[83:22.31]There's like a lord's rune in the old world I could just go get.
[83:25.03]It's like 50,000.
[83:26.01]Where the fuck is it?
[83:28.11]Down in Lyndell somewhere.
[83:38.20]Ah, fuck.
[83:39.44]Fuck, I'm in trouble.
[83:40.86]I'm in trouble.
[83:41.24]I think I lose this first one.
[83:42.86]Don't worry, we got the warm-up one done.
[83:44.24]I ain't gonna make the same mistake on the next few.
[84:05.32]It's a full armor set here.
[84:12.79]I just got to get... I have to start putting pressure on him.
[84:16.09]Right?
[84:16.55]Because right now he's like, oh, la-di-da, I'm going to make my way to St.
[84:19.73]Trina.
[84:20.05]I'm going to make Calvary Lana.
[84:21.51]Turbo socks.
[84:23.35]Turbo socks.
[84:24.05]And that's fine.
[84:24.87]But once he sees that I've got like three spaces down here and he's like, oh, shit, he might have to abandon what he's doing.
[84:37.18]Was best dressed at one hour and 15.
[84:39.30]Okay.
[84:42.24]I got to start getting squares.
[84:54.76]Once the pressure starts mounting where he's like, oh shit, okay, I know what he's doing.
[84:58.43]I might be able to pull him away from Santrina.
[85:26.79]Alright, I gotta stop talking to you guys.
[85:28.33]I'm gonna lock in now.
[85:38.20]I gotta focus up.
[86:05.73]There actually are a couple items in here I probably should get.
[86:07.85]Where are they?
[86:08.35]I love watching stirs POV right now.
[86:20.39]Don't.
[86:21.89]Don't you dare.
[86:27.09]Ster's probably sitting there eating grapes.
[86:29.61]He's probably leaning back in his chair.
[86:31.35]He's probably yawned already three times.
[86:34.21]I should have made my secret slime action yawn.
[86:36.21]Because if he yawned, it's like he's already bored.
[86:41.41]He's already beating me.
[86:42.37]He probably would have yawned.
[86:43.17]I could have won.
[86:43.63]Okay.
[86:49.71]Let's go down.
[86:51.89]I want the items, right?
[87:00.61]I don't think so.
[87:01.79]I just have to get to the fucking America statue.
[87:14.10]It.
[87:14.20]Alright, I think this armored here.
[87:27.90]Wait a minute.
[87:29.42]Donnie Potts.
[87:31.91]No, that's not even... I can't even win with that anyways.
[87:37.07]Isn't there... I know there's something up here.
[87:38.93]Okay, focus up.
[87:48.54]Don't do the same thing I just did last time.
[87:52.56]You gotta hurry.
[87:53.12]Hurry!
[87:53.52]I'm hurry!
[87:53.96]I'm going as fast as I can!
[87:55.02]Stop it!
[87:56.00]Stop freaking me out!
[87:56.72]Don't say hurry!
[88:00.65]What do you mean hurry?
[88:23.71]Okay, this is where it all fell apart right here.
[88:31.94]No.
[88:39.56]Okay, isn't there shit to get over here?
[88:41.42]There's a way you can go around, alright?
[89:00.79]I can't fuck around, I gotta go.
[89:27.72]Oh, my God.
[90:09.61]Come on!
[90:40.06]Oh!
[91:00.24]Come on!
[91:34.78]so so so
[92:09.74]Fuck!
[92:10.98]That first fucking try, I locked in and I... If you just get caught up, one, two...
[92:37.46]so so
[93:05.92]Okay I did it, I did it, I'm good.
[93:36.47]That's another fucking player is here.
[93:40.75]Okay, okay, good, good, good, good, good.
[93:49.27]Okay, I need to go.
[93:50.37]I need mariners.
[93:53.40]I need mariners.
[93:54.00]I need mariners.
[93:54.80]Wait, I need mariners.
[93:55.74]I need to be a mariner.
[93:56.46]Mariner, mariner.
[93:57.64]To be a mariner.
[93:59.32]To be a mariner.
[93:59.80]Is that up here somewhere?
[94:01.42]Is it to be a mariner here?
[94:08.46]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[94:09.28]I should probably get something from here.
[94:10.32]Isn't there... Can I... Isn't there, like, a secret to go?
[94:25.03]Is there a secret here?
[94:26.73]Oh, no.
[94:27.13]Fuck it.
[94:27.41]I gotta get out of here.
[94:28.05]Okay.
[94:30.03]Where... It's down here, I think.
[94:31.60]I think the Mariner's down here.
[94:35.16]I think.
[94:36.24]I don't know.
[94:37.82]I don't know.
[94:38.80]It's not here.
[94:40.68]Up here.
[94:41.08]Up here.
[94:41.32]It's right here.
[94:41.82]Right there.
[94:42.12]Right there.
[94:42.36]Right there.
[94:42.86]Shh.
[94:43.28]Don't fucking tell any... Don't tell Stuart what's going on.
[94:52.87]Okay.
[94:53.21]So I'll have... I could... I'm not in a bad spot.
[94:56.09]Right now, Stuart just probably went... Bro, what the... What the fuck?
[95:00.52]He probably freaked out.
[95:03.84]Okay.
[95:08.56]Do remembrances so he can't stop you.
[95:11.07]He still needs to kill those bosses too.
[95:13.03]Don't forget.
[95:14.61]We both don't have any at this point.
[95:17.81]Binding of Isaac?
[95:19.69]The sludge boss in Binding of Isaac is not a remembrance.
[95:25.94]I need crunchies.
[95:26.58]Yep.
[95:27.06]Let me get the mariner first.
[95:36.58]I fell asleep on stream.
[95:45.83]I do need to get crunchies.
[95:47.01]Okay, there is like a lord's ruin in Lyndell.
[95:53.91]I think I remember where it is.
[95:55.49]Where the fuck am I?
[96:00.21]I'm at like Stormhill right now.
[96:12.49]Get the drip from the mausoleum.
[96:14.19]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[96:15.25]We have what?
[96:16.21]How much time do I have before we have to do the drip?
[96:19.15]Not that it matters because nobody can even win with it anyways.
[96:21.60]Actually, I might.
[96:22.46]I might be able to do that.
[96:23.98]I can solve his shithead painting.
[96:38.97]Let me just get this.
[96:40.29]I know I'll like I want it later.
[96:46.17]I suppose I have no choice then.
[96:54.39]Is this what graces you are an individual for?
[97:15.76]I mean, come on, man.
[97:16.96]I got the fucking best armor in the game now.
[97:18.34]Don't tell him.
[97:18.98]Don't say a goddamn word.
[97:22.83]Wait.
[97:28.99]Keep the helmet off.
[97:30.45]And take the pants off, too.
[97:31.17]Take the gloves off.
[97:37.62]I don't have time for this shit.
[97:38.66]I gotta go now.
[97:41.40]Don't nobody tell him anything.
[97:48.34]I'm sorry, was that really loud in your ears?
[97:49.96]I'm really sorry about getting really excited there.
[98:13.75]Get off me!
[98:14.75]Get away from me!
[98:20.74]Putting that on too.
[98:32.91]You kidding me?
[98:33.41]Look at how awesome that is.
[98:35.13]If I get one of their hats, it's going on instead.
[98:37.91]Wait a minute.
[98:41.90]Oh, that looks like shit.
[98:49.40]I gotta put the cape on?
[98:51.42]Guys, don't worry.
[98:51.98]Don't worry.
[98:52.22]I got time.
[98:52.68]I have like 20 minutes.
[98:54.37]What's important right now is to kill Tibium Ernie.
[99:04.23]Sturges beat Messmer.
[99:05.84]I would be shocked if that were the case.
[99:09.34]How much time until, uh, until the Committee of Judges?
[99:22.47]Bottom doesn't matter without crunchies.
[99:27.27]I gotta go find like Bok.
[99:29.30]Bok is down in Limgrave.
[99:30.84]Let me do this first.
[99:47.53]Alter the cape.
[99:58.25]Well, I need to talk to Bok.
[100:07.23]Alright, this should be easy.
[100:08.13]There's one in Laernia.
[100:12.59]There's one in the DLC, too.
[100:36.07]Okay.
[101:09.97]I think I know where this is.
[101:11.77]Watch this.
[101:13.19]Don't give this secret away.
[101:14.41]Please don't.
[101:14.91]Because this is... I've checked this out.
[101:21.81]I'm pretty sure if you kill the avatar down here, it's... Where is he?
[101:29.00]He's like down here.
[101:29.90]He's like down the main...
[101:35.53]Where the fuck am I going?
[101:37.09]Fuck.
[101:39.07]You kill the avatar and he drops like a fucking 100,000 rune or something.
[101:47.12]How do I get down there from here?
[101:50.00]That's good.
[101:50.36]That's a good start.
[101:50.88]Good start.
[102:04.73]30 seconds until drip?
[102:12.87]30 seconds till crunchy check.
[102:14.73]Wait, crunchy's now.
[102:25.75]How many- I wasn't even fucking doing this!
[102:28.53]How many crunchies do I have?
[102:32.61]12,500 plus 3,800?
[102:33.91]Did I lose?
[102:45.64]How many crunchies do you have?
[102:49.25]Do you- do you have like a shitload of crunchies that I don't know about?
[102:56.42]Is he listening?
[102:58.04]It's not.
[102:58.78]Oh, hey.
[103:00.14]How many crunches do you have?
[103:00.88]Give me one second.
[103:01.62]I got like boss music going.
[103:02.84]What do you mean boss music?
[103:04.04]Why do you have boss music playing?
[103:07.10]Because, hold on, crunches.
[103:12.18]I have two.
[103:13.96]Okay, you got, yeah, that's, what are they?
[103:18.06]Oh, we're going to go by value?
[103:19.34]It's by value.
[103:21.62]Okay, I've got total 13,000.
[103:26.89]yes let's go how many do you have 16 something thousand man I was on my way to try and go find some I just couldn't remember where like uh some stuff was oh oh boy this is getting a little interesting congrats on your crunchy victory
[103:47.22]I thought you had me beat right there, too.
[103:48.58]I really did.
[103:50.02]Because I only have two as well.
[103:52.13]By the way, you would have just one.
[103:54.99]I tried to, for like the last five minutes, tried to find crunchies.
[103:58.11]Dude, this is so ridiculous.
[104:01.35]Right when they were like, hey, it's one hour.
[104:05.45]Ten seconds before that I picked up a fucking level nine ruin down in Lyndell.
[104:10.80]That was just, I would have lost.
[104:14.16]You would have had it clutched.
[104:16.45]How do you feel so far?
[104:17.09]How do I feel?
[104:19.53]Stop talking.
[104:20.43]Wait, are you like doing something right now?
[104:23.85]Of course I'm playing the game right now, yeah.
[104:25.91]Well, you must have a halftime check.
[104:28.23]Halftime check?
[104:30.15]What is that?
[104:30.65]Oh, you want to pause?
[104:32.44]Yeah, let's have a halftime check.
[104:33.34]How do you feel?
[104:35.96]Let me pause my timer.
[104:38.48]Let me get a real legit pause going on in here.
[104:41.70]And let me just teleport to a Grace real quick so I'm not... No, I'm going to crouch.
[104:45.54]I'm going to put the football down and crouch.
[104:47.58]How am I feeling right now?
[104:48.90]I feel like you're under a lot of pressure to go...
[104:52.85]Sniff Trina's toes ten times.
[104:56.23]Dude, you are going to... I'm not going to tell you what you're doing right now, but what I'm doing, I am desperately trying to snipe you.
[105:07.23]To snipe me?
[105:08.02]Yep.
[105:12.58]To, like... I mean, you can very clearly see the two routes we're both taking right now.
[105:19.42]Yes.
[105:20.14]Right.
[105:21.34]Um...
[105:25.02]Oh, hey, by the way, this is important to know too.
[105:28.88]This is a very important thing.
[105:31.28]If there is no bingo possible,
[105:35.10]that's okay it's just whoever has more squares at the end we have to we have to call it at a certain point so if there's no more possible bingo then what we have to say is okay one hour from now this is it so whoever has more squares an hour from uh like impossible bingo but we're not there yet there's still there's still plenty of things we're only doing a two hour per bingo
[105:59.61]No, I'm just saying if bingo becomes impossible, but there's still squares to take, we put like a 30 minute timer on it.
[106:06.93]Okay.
[106:07.89]And then whoever has more squares wins.
[106:10.49]Yeah, no, I, uh, we, we were, I, I lost, I died like 10 times in the Yoda dungeon.
[106:17.88]It was very embarrassing.
[106:19.08]Were you trying, you were trying to snipe me?
[106:21.30]I ran to the end to Yoda and then tried to use the stake of Marika to die 20 times.
[106:26.47]And it puts you in the beginning of the dungeon.
[106:30.56]I died like five times in there too.
[106:32.53]I thought you were just gonna style on me so bad there.
[106:36.96]yeah same same okay but you know as it turns out uh radon's great bow is not a good weapon no it's not it is it is most certainly not a good weapon I can also tell you uh the two flame of frenzy spells I've used once on a dog uh so it's going great over here is really good vikes that's the only reason why I'm doing anything right now
[107:01.89]I'm having to use this dagger on everybody.
[107:03.67]Like, I rotted Yoda, and it was still like, I can't wait for 10 minutes for this to kill him.
[107:13.80]Okay.
[107:14.82]Okay.
[107:15.22]Okay.
[107:16.70]Okay.
[107:18.50]I think we can go back to it.
[107:22.25]Okay.
[107:22.57]You ready?
[107:23.53]Are you having fun?
[107:24.81]This is fun.
[107:25.69]I like this a lot.
[107:26.63]It's a lot more stressful than you would have thought to, like, fart into a lighter and stuff.
[107:32.08]yeah I had a panic moment when but it's alright is that I like this I tried to solve your painting by the way if you could because take a look take a look at my stream I turned you for the brightness all the way it didn't really help I still don't know where the this is
[108:02.60]Yeah, I mean, if you could find it.
[108:04.38]It's not undoable.
[108:06.67]It is definitely not undoable, but the amount of caves that exist in this game that look like that, there's like 30.
[108:12.65]I don't know.
[108:13.89]I think if you just put on your detective goggles, you could find this thing.
[108:17.87]Do you think so?
[108:19.36]Yeah.
[108:22.00]I don't know.
[108:22.50]I have no idea.
[108:23.70]It could be in the base game for all I know.
[108:25.42]I don't know.
[108:25.96]Do you want a hint?
[108:32.80]uh if you'd like to I mean I'll take a hint if you want one yeah I don't think you need a hint for mine mine's my you should be able to find mine I'm gonna give you a hint I'm just gonna say dogs dogs dogs dogs dogs oh okay alright okay I'm feeling it I'm feeling it
[108:56.66]you um you ready to get back into it ready to get back into it we have a uh we have a fit check coming up in about 15 minutes or so we do uh with uh we'll be yelled at when it's a fit check yeah alright uh good luck talk to you soon dg alright there's another mariner here okay I'm muted where's the other mariner right here it's either no it's right no no no no no no where's the other mariner here
[109:26.06]One, two... It's not in the big open space.
[109:31.18]It's not in the big open space.
[109:41.96]I just... It's definitely not... This is all that, like, Ronnie shit.
[109:46.59]It's not up there.
[109:50.45]Maybe right here?
[109:53.09]It's possible that it's up right there.
[109:56.54]Move the bingo screen?
[109:57.38]Oh shit.
[110:09.08]There's no water down here.
[110:10.62]Let me see.
[110:11.66]Let me just take a good look.
[110:14.62]If I just get, I just gotta get in the zone and look at it.
[110:16.20]It's been a while.
[110:23.78]It's not in the big lake.
[110:34.55]Is the one in Caelid?
[110:35.60]No, it's... Where's the last mariner in the base game?
[110:40.98]Up here.
[110:41.34]The last mariner is up here and it's like one of these... It's like all this big skeleton dudes, right?
[111:03.11]I think it's that, I think it's that up there.
[111:04.71]I think it's five.
[111:05.29]I think he's just sitting in like a fucking pool.
[111:21.22]And the last one, this one in the snow field.
[111:23.28]This one... Wait, what is, what are these items?
[111:30.37]This might be good for a fit check.
[111:38.15]Give me the item, please.
[111:43.57]Why don't you have any eyebrows?
[111:45.89]It's like 120 degrees here every day.
[111:48.70]And I try to get out the sun.
[111:51.36]And it turns my eyebrows like blonde.
[111:53.48]So, there you go.
[111:54.68]That's why.
[112:06.06]Okay.
[112:07.82]Where's five?
[112:10.83]No, it's not here.
[112:11.73]I don't want that Grace either.
[112:14.01]I don't care.
[112:14.97]A pyramid?
[112:15.43]Yeah.
[112:15.71]Let me try.
[112:16.07]Let me see if I'm right.
[112:22.72]Is there one in Altus?
[112:25.16]In like the water in Altus?
[112:26.14]I think that's what the Dung Eater is.
[112:54.92]I think I'm right.
[112:55.66]Am I wrong?
[113:01.79]Shit, I think I'm wrong.
[113:13.88]I think I'm wrong.
[113:15.80]This is- It's wrong?
[113:18.12]How am I wrong?
[113:23.12]That's not big enough for a mariner.
[113:32.04]He's not just like floating around in here, is he?
[113:34.02]Because that's technically a swamp.
[113:46.47]It's either, okay, it's either the one that I just turned around from or it's the one I'm going to right now.
[113:52.48]And then the last one, I think I know where it is.
[113:54.60]It's, it is one at, in the snow fields.
[114:12.39]Oh fuck, okay, okay, okay.
[114:51.92]Don't disappear, don't disappear.
[114:53.16]Kill him, kill him, kill him.
[114:55.40]Oh my God, I'm fucking mad!
[114:57.10]Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[115:06.47]What?
[115:07.31]What, he got three?
[115:08.21]When did he get three?
[115:09.31]What?
[115:10.79]No, fuck!
[115:12.73]Oh, this is a disaster.
[115:15.35]This is a disaster.
[115:20.66]He got the third one?
[115:21.70]When?
[115:22.02]He's sniping.
[115:25.90]He's sniping me.
[115:27.19]When did he get the third one?
[115:30.15]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[115:30.95]I gotta pivot.
[115:31.41]I gotta pivot.
[115:31.87]Where do I go?
[115:45.42]St.
[115:45.60]Trina's gonna take forever.
[115:55.72]I could just fuck up his whole row here and just try to kill him.
[115:59.75]How many times have I died?
[116:05.79]No!
[116:07.19]What?
[116:09.40]How does he... What are you talking about?
[116:14.00]Are there three people playing under Ster's account?
[116:20.00]It's not over.
[116:20.68]It's not over.
[116:29.36]I might go get the lighter.
[116:33.66]I might fart and do a lighter.
[116:35.78]I might fart and do a lighter.
[116:36.72]I gotta get to Santorino.
[116:41.50]Neither one of us, I think, wants to do Santorino.
[116:45.94]Shit.
[116:46.32]Okay.
[116:55.38]He can't take the right row.
[116:58.93]He might just go for it right now though.
[117:07.65]It's gonna take a fucking long time for him to do that.
[117:20.42]I gotta get the nobles to plus 10.
[117:22.26]Don't tell him.
[117:22.86]I think I know where they are.
[117:25.40]How am I gonna get the nobles to plus 10?
[117:29.32]I gotta, I gotta win best rest.
[117:31.70]I gotta find out his, where his painting is.
[117:33.14]I think I, wait, okay.
[117:34.50]Dogs, dogs, dogs.
[117:35.56]It's like the first, it's the first cave.
[117:38.72]I'll find it.
[117:43.74]He's already got four talismans on too?
[117:45.64]Who, what is happening?
[117:48.86]Um.
[117:54.94]The rest of those in that row are hard though.
[117:58.86]I could go try to kill Frenzy Flamelord right now.
[118:01.37]It's going to be so hard, but I could try it.
[118:11.46]I think it's right there.
[118:12.32]Is it two?
[118:13.02]It might be two right now.
[118:17.80]Everything that he needs to do takes a long ass time.
[118:40.60]I know what to do.
[118:42.12]We're going, we're going for, don't, don't tell us, don't say, don't, don't fucking stream hop.
[118:46.35]You know exactly what we're doing.
[119:10.16]Heart snipe incoming.
[119:14.68]With the cape on?
[119:16.72]I don't have buck.
[119:42.64]Don't pick these up, just go man!
[120:30.26]It doesn't matter.
[120:38.85]I got a shitload of armor.
[120:40.07]I'm fine.
[121:17.76]It's going to be important later.
[121:20.16]If anybody's stream hopping right now, I'm going to be pissed.
[121:27.16]Because this is a sealed deal right now.
[121:31.97]Sealed deal.
[121:33.29]Do not stream hop.
[121:34.95]I will be furious with you.
[121:50.59]This is a D... This is... This is... We can't do this!
[121:55.05]It's a DLC Remembrance boss without rolling.
[121:58.09]Not a regular one!
[121:59.12]It's okay.
[122:05.58]Drip check!
[122:06.46]Drip check!
[122:09.18]Just tell him, hold on a second.
[122:11.26]Uh, what's your drip looking like?
[122:16.96]I can't hear anything.
[122:21.32]Tell him I'm busy.
[122:21.85]Tell him I'm busy.
[122:22.67]Tell him I'm busy.
[122:23.45]I can't... No, he doesn't win.
[122:37.70]I see what he's doing.
[122:38.54]Oh, so you get to keep playing and I don't.
[122:40.30]So when I was in a little fight earlier and I... No, no, no.
[122:43.34]Okay, I'm stuck.
[122:44.40]I'm stuck.
[122:44.90]Okay, I'm stuck.
[122:45.64]Drip check.
[122:53.48]No fucking way, dude.
[122:56.72]No way.
[122:59.22]Are you serious?
[123:05.79]Pretty good drip, I think.
[123:14.99]Alright, so.
[123:16.17]We are wearing the same armor.
[123:18.09]What?
[123:18.31]What do you mean?
[123:19.27]We are both wearing the identical armor set.
[123:21.91]We're wearing the same armor?
[123:24.31]We're both wearing the exact same armor.
[123:27.44]What?
[123:28.26]And then your shield kind of matches it and my bow kind of matches it.
[123:37.43]okay well so what do we do about this uh drip check uh in another 40 or something you want to you want to postpone drip check and do drip check too in like in like three minutes yeah I want I want the run back I'm putting the timer back on because you're in a fight we both wore the same dress to the club that's that's wild
[124:02.72]Why did you even go there?
[124:04.72]What were you doing there?
[124:05.74]Because I was killing mariners and that was like the... I was... I just walked by the shack and I was like, okay, that guy's in there.
[124:12.40]So I was like, I'll just fucking kill him for it.
[124:15.76]You just kill people?
[124:17.46]That was the first mariner I went to and I didn't have this Grace.
[124:22.91]The only Grace we had was like here and I just ran around and over here and... True.
[124:29.68]Someone's got to change.
[124:30.94]Okay, drip check in another 30 minutes, maybe?
[124:35.81]I guess so.
[124:37.55]How did you get all this shit in like 30 seconds, by the way?
[124:40.03]I can't believe it.
[124:41.99]You got four talismans.
[124:43.32]You died 20 times.
[124:44.26]You got three mariners.
[124:45.58]This all happened in like 15 seconds.
[124:48.33]Oh, because I had already died so many times in the Yoda dungeon.
[124:52.23]Unintentionally.
[124:53.05]Oh, shit.
[124:54.63]That's right.
[124:55.85]And I had accidentally earlier stumbled across one of the easier mariners.
[125:02.67]Like, I was looking for the crunchies near the first mariner.
[125:05.59]That's the easiest.
[125:06.77]And I couldn't find the crunchies, so I killed the mariner.
[125:10.26]And then after that, I saw you.
[125:11.56]Obviously, you were going for him.
[125:12.78]So I went to block.
[125:16.19]Dude, how the hell are we going to defeat any DLC Remembrance boss without rolling?
[125:24.10]I mean, I think I have an idea, but... I guess?
[125:28.08]I'm going to go do it.
[125:29.66]You're going to do it?
[125:30.22]That's on my to-do list.
[125:32.30]I mean, maybe I shouldn't have told you, but that shit's on my to-do list.
[125:34.81]I mean, I figured by you getting four talismans and dying 20 times, this row is now up for grabs.
[125:39.87]St. Trina is a huge pain in the ass.
[125:41.59]We're both avoiding it, even though you could win with it.
[125:44.57]Well, what if you kill St.
[125:45.73]Trina without rolling?
[125:47.69]I mean, that's... I mean... Futurant Knight, you mean?
[125:51.76]That's not gonna... It's gonna be really hard.
[125:55.82]Well, what if... Well, what if you decided to do this playthrough with, like, the worst weapon ever?
[126:02.60]The Redanbo?
[126:03.84]Yeah.
[126:05.64]That's true.
[126:06.63]So, I... We seem to have a plan, both of us here.
[126:10.67]Yep.
[126:12.08]When's the fit check?
[126:12.82]We are at about an hour and 20.
[126:15.88]Let's say... At the moment.
[126:18.08]Maybe like another 30 minutes?
[126:21.98]Can we get 40?
[126:23.94]We do at two hours?
[126:27.36]Yeah, that works.
[126:28.94]Okay.
[126:29.12]Alright.
[126:31.40]Best of luck.
[126:32.24]See you later.
[126:35.71]I cannot believe you both didn't say fucking on and on.
[126:37.39]Alright, well, I'm going to get the remembrance here.
[126:39.51]I think...
[126:41.76]Okay, let me just get this real quick.
[126:45.29]I need to start.
[126:47.03]Okay, I got to go get the nobles.
[126:49.19]I got to go.
[126:49.69]I got to solve this painting.
[126:50.51]I think this is still so loud.
[126:52.35]I don't even know how.
[126:56.47]I have to win best press.
[127:07.49]I could also just say screw it and just make my way to Trina now.
[127:14.59]And he's going to be doing all this bullshit.
[127:17.13]I have an idea.
[127:17.51]Okay.
[127:17.93]Okay.
[127:18.07]Okay.
[127:18.97]Hold on a second.
[127:26.28]I'm going to go try Drillana so hard.
[127:28.66]It's like my least favorite boss in the game.
[127:30.60]I know there's another way down there though.
[127:39.46]I could try to kill the Frenzy Clan boss, but not with one Skidoo Frag.
[127:45.04]Why did you take two incantations if you're not going to use them ever?
[127:48.01]Uh, well, because I thought I was going to use them and then everything got really hard and I got really panicked.
[127:53.37]And, uh, it just didn't work out.
[127:55.21]It's just unfortunate.
[128:01.71]I have a Remembrance now.
[128:03.85]So that's one out of five.
[128:15.13]okay so getting through that laser zone blocks him too okay I gotta I gotta get down there it's time it's time just to make the trek I know there's a way down there and I it's like maybe like here but you know you gotta you have to break the spell first is there there's a way there has to be a way to get like up here and then go around right
[128:46.14]It's definitely like right here.
[128:49.08]It has to be.
[128:54.27]Or like here.
[128:56.15]Or here.
[128:58.81]Let's go for it.
[128:59.73]Let me try to sneak my way through here.
[129:06.33]Can you move the cam for a rune check?
[129:09.65]Yeah, I got 20,000 right now.
[129:18.84]Alright, these are the few locations where I think it is.
[129:30.63]Take my time.
[129:31.25]As long as I can get over there and do the laser zone, he's screwed.
[129:41.86]So let's, it's either here, here, or here.
[129:45.59]Those are the things I'm going to go look for.
[129:46.98]He can have fun killing fucking Rolanda all he wants.
[129:50.14]Not me.
[129:59.98]What happens if one of you is able to get a bingo?
[130:02.80]Then the game is over and we refresh.
[130:05.06]We have a whole nother board to do with stuff, all completely unique things.
[130:11.45]This is just one board.
[130:12.31]We have about 50 things that we put down.
[130:13.97]So this is just board one of two.
[130:16.99]So, oh, there we go.
[130:18.83]Yeah.
[130:25.24]Let's get through this.
[130:26.66]Don't rush.
[130:28.08]He's probably going to be rushing.
[130:29.52]That's fine.
[130:41.60]Okay.
[130:43.06]Is it over here?
[131:02.82]It's like the longest I've ever fallen in this whole- in any FromSoftware game.
[131:06.22]I fell for like 15 seconds straight.
[131:34.25]I feel like it is right here.
[131:35.63]And then you just get up here and you can come down.
[131:39.53]I think that's accurate.
[131:41.79]One thing at a time.
[131:42.55]I'm going to go to one.
[131:50.68]And then I got to remember that you go all the way down that like waterfall.
[131:53.82]I just got to make it down.
[131:55.00]I have to get through that shit.
[131:58.72]I got to build up some confidence here.
[132:01.26]Like Ster was saying, it's so nerve-wracking.
[132:03.72]Everything is so nerve-wracking right now.
[132:05.85]I feel like my blood pressure is like times 10 than it normally is.
[132:17.37]I was down here before.
[132:19.31]What did I miss?
[132:23.18]Up here maybe?
[132:36.64]Don't you dare
[133:25.62]Because this is the way you go to get... Okay.
[133:37.73]So this goes to Ancient Dragon Man.
[133:41.93]I could put the pressure on him.
[133:46.54]With a dragon.
[133:47.40]I don't have a dragon.
[133:57.90]I need a dragon spell.
[134:10.47]Let me go to where I was going to go.
[134:11.63]Ancient dragon men is that way.
[134:31.57]I'm about to- I'm about to put pressure on him so bad.
[134:34.34]I know the story!
[134:50.06]I know the story!
[134:59.26]What the fuck is on the ground, dude?
[135:03.43]What happened to the ground?
[135:07.29]Bingo.
[135:10.09]And it's kill ancient, real ancient, it's kill ancient dragon man with the dragon.
[135:14.68]Can I equip this?
[135:15.22]I need 20 strength.
[135:22.14]I can do it in two hands though, can't I?
[135:23.30]Can I do it in two hands?
[135:30.75]shit I need 20 strength ah is it thy way
[136:32.60]Yeah, you can respect as many times as you want.
[136:39.41]Okay.
[136:42.81]He's fucking dead.
[137:00.65]You cannot two-hand the dragon head.
[137:09.61]I have no idea what he's doing right now, but all I know is that I'm going to put the pressure up big time and I got to find like a Barf Drinker helmet or something stupid.
[137:18.84]I need a new outfit in like, what, 20 minutes?
[137:24.82]I think I know where his painting is.
[137:40.14]upgrade the dragon.
[137:43.99]I just have to kill him with it.
[137:45.39]I don't have to do every point of damage with it.
[137:47.37]He just needs to be killed with it.
[137:51.86]Just kill ancient dragon man with a dragon.
[137:54.38]He needs to be killed with it.
[137:56.04]All of his health doesn't need to be removed.
[138:00.06]I just got to get him to one more hit and just fucking spray fire in his face.
[138:08.53]OK, I need to see the map.
[138:10.53]Yeah, OK, go go go go go go go go go go go.
[138:36.60]What's going on?
[138:37.02]Oh, right.
[138:40.76]It's Igor.
[138:42.10]Whatever Igor's name is.
[138:51.04]I don't need to talk to Igor.
[138:53.82]But I'm gonna because I like him.
[138:55.46]Nice.
[138:55.56]Coolest character in the game.

[140:55.99]Shit, everything I have is too heavy.
[140:56.95]I think I'll be fine.
[141:05.54]Can I drop down there?
[141:06.26]I don't think so.
[141:17.23]Okay.
[141:18.71]No!
[141:21.64]Shit!
[141:21.88]Ugh!

[146:51.44]With the arm?
[146:53.10]Oh, that's huge.
[146:53.94]I just need something better for the helmet and better for the chest.
[147:01.36]Alright, I gotta find something here.
[147:03.53]How much time do I have for the drip?
[147:09.65]Okay.

[149:00.82]It'll do for now.
[149:15.16]Oh, it'll do for now.
[149:26.17]Does Kenneth Haight have any clothing?
[149:28.57]I can't kill Kenneth Haight.
[149:30.41]That's just like a sin.
[149:31.83]You can't do that.
[149:32.59]No way.
[149:38.17]No, I don't want Dee's armor.
[149:39.71]No, no, no, no.
[149:40.31]I know he's over there too.
[149:41.07]I think I'm going to go for like a windmill.
[149:46.94]One of those.
[149:47.58]Hold on.
[150:01.17]Can't you get their drip?
[150:36.08]Not worth it.
[150:39.12]You could go kill Igon for his drip.
[150:41.76]No, no, I can't do that either.
[150:55.46]Dude, this is just the set that we both have.
[150:57.42]The only difference is I now have a dumb hat on.
[151:03.13]Like, I'm gonna fucking lose.
[151:12.53]All I did is put a birthday hat on.
[151:14.29]That's not gonna help me.
[151:15.18]I gotta think.
[151:19.68]I think I gotta go around Lyndell.
[151:22.04]There's a bunch of goofy shit in Lyndell.
[151:33.72]yeah I could kill yep that's I'm thinking I could kill more god wait these guys got some pretty sick drip too if I get that helmet it would be great
[152:08.41]Good start.
[152:10.29]Not a, really not a bad start, especially with the dragon on my arm.
[152:20.99]It doesn't match.
[152:21.59]That's okay.
[152:24.76]What else is here?
[152:25.30]Oh, it's just a ruin arc.
[152:26.68]Uh, alright.
[152:27.58]No, I want to go up.
[152:28.46]Let's kill Morgott.
[152:30.16]Because Morgott has like the, the cape.
[152:37.46]You look goofy.
[152:38.74]It's okay.
[152:44.00]That's pretty... Okay, I'm sorry.
[152:45.47]Uh... It just... I mean, it looks like this character just doesn't take the helmet off even when he goes to sleep in his pajamas.
[153:01.25]I can sell that.
[153:16.87]And this is my dragon stuffed animal.
[153:20.42]I think I already won.
[153:31.21]Okay.
[153:38.12]Actually, you know what?
[153:38.90]I can level up.
[153:40.73]I can level up fast.
[153:45.79]Not that it matters.
[153:51.13]We gotta, yeah.
[153:52.32]Let me spend these birds.
[153:54.96]These guys have cool drip too.
[154:04.37]Give me something cool.
[154:05.25]Okay, there's a couple more of these knights down here.
[154:13.53]If I can get maybe their gloves or their boots or maybe their chest piece.
[154:26.88]Okay.
[154:35.43]Well, that's not what I wanted, but that's still fine.
[154:42.03]Shit.
[154:44.66]Damn it.
[155:00.51]Put Cam on the top, right?
[155:02.89]Uh, isn't there some stuff in here?
[155:03.93]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[155:04.65]I'll do it in a second.
[155:05.87]Press for time right now.
[155:06.61]Wait a minute.
[155:09.37]Is this better with the hat?
[155:11.33]I think this is that dude's hat, right?
[155:14.16]Ooh, boy.
[155:20.10]There is no way he wins.
[155:21.62]Not a fucking chance.
[155:23.18]I'm sorry, guys.
[155:24.62]Not a single chance that he wins.
[155:30.70]I look kingly.
[155:31.66]I look regal.
[155:32.40]I look awesome.
[155:34.87]Not a chance.
[155:35.51]Look at how much I match the vikespear with the shoulder pads and the dragon arm.
[155:42.07]It's over.
[155:42.85]It is over, over, over.
[155:48.99]No, I don't... I think it's this.
[155:55.92]Perfect.
[155:56.96]Oh, it's perfect in every way.
[156:04.83]That looks awesome.
[156:07.89]Yup.
[156:14.64]Even better if I get these legs.
[156:36.08]It's okay.
[156:38.56]I'll take anything I can get at this point.
[156:46.32]It matches the stones on the back.
[157:03.42]Don't lose it here.
[157:04.24]Come on.
[157:09.32]Just kill them.
[157:23.49]Ooh, wait a minute.
[157:25.05]Let's check that.
[157:25.83]Hold on.
[157:30.97]It's kind of goofy, but I don't hate it.
[157:33.87]I don't know.
[157:34.37]I think the other one's better.
[157:37.63]It's kind of like a chef.
[157:41.17]It matches though.
[157:42.05]This is going to be a really tough decision because we could go with kind of chef with.
[157:57.12]It matches the helmet better.
[157:59.50]But the red gems match everything else.
[158:01.08]I think it's perfect.
[158:10.60]Okay.
[158:11.50]In the meantime... In the meantime, I need... I think I know where it is.
[158:23.00]I think I'm locking this in.
[158:28.43]In the meantime, where I'm going... I'm red, by the way, if you don't know.
[158:32.67]I'm going to go to the nobles and secretly, silently, quietly...
[158:43.59]Okay, is it?
[158:45.41]He said dogs.
[158:46.85]To me, that's literally like right here.
[158:48.85]It's like the first dungeon in the game.
[158:51.93]It's either right here or right here.
[158:56.37]I think it's the one that Patches is in.
[158:58.99]Isn't Patches in that one?
[158:59.98]It's either one or the other, and I'm going to go for it.
[159:15.90]Let me just check this one.
[159:17.62]I'll know very quickly if it is.
[159:30.18]I don't think it's this one.
[159:31.74]But, I mean, why not just check, right?
[159:34.12]Is this going to kill me?
[159:40.06]I don't think it's not that one.
[159:42.16]This is one of those Smithing Stone dungeons.
[159:43.56]It's not that one.
[159:45.40]Okay, that's good info.
[159:51.86]There's spit everywhere.
[159:56.50]Um... It's literally right here somewhere.
[160:21.28]Out there.
[160:21.72]Right here somewhere.
[160:38.93]Is this it?
[160:39.35]Is this it?
[160:39.65]This might be it right now.
[160:40.81]I think this is it.
[160:44.44]Is this the one with the wolves?
[160:50.18]You never should have given me that hint.
[160:54.80]It's not it.
[160:55.12]It's not the right one.
[160:55.77]It's not it.
[161:01.81]It's not it.
[161:04.31]Nope.
[161:04.55]This is wrong.
[161:14.74]Shit.
[161:17.90]Where is this other one at?
[161:21.91]There's one on the beach.
[161:24.35]Where on the beach?
[161:29.73]Like down there.
[161:30.33]Okay.
[161:33.17]Down here?
[161:51.93]Oh, this is where the merchant is.
[161:53.31]I don't think there's anything down here.
[161:59.34]It's not that one.
[162:00.24]Is it like in here?
[162:08.31]No.
[162:08.55]What about like in here?
[162:27.56]It's one of the, ah, it's one of these.
[162:31.87]Okay, hold on.
[162:33.29]I wish I could... Just like, it's so funny when you go back to play this game and you're like, oh, the base game.
[162:39.85]It's like, oh, where's the first dungeon of the game?
[162:44.13]It's like, right.
[162:45.95]I found all the other ones, but the one I have to find...
[162:59.58]It's like in it's in there.
[163:01.56]It's right there.
[163:04.08]It's right there.
[163:04.64]It's right there.
[163:05.10]It's right there.
[163:05.50]It's right there.
[163:05.86]It's right there.
[163:06.24]It's right there.
[163:06.62]It's right there.
[163:23.64]Is it?
[163:23.98]It's not right here.
[163:25.90]Oh shit.
[163:33.30]Is there one here?
[163:34.10]Is this it?
[163:52.18]I don't think this is the right one.
[163:56.08]How far down did he go?
[164:04.07]I can't tell.
[164:04.69]It's too dark.
[164:10.71]Remember, this is a painting.
[164:11.71]I gotta be in the right... I gotta be standing in the right spot.
[164:13.53]I think that's it right there.
[164:24.08]That's pretty damn close.
[164:26.60]Is that it?
[164:28.80]Where's the torch?
[164:52.68]I don't know if this is the right spot.
[165:01.00]I think it's a little bit further down.
[165:14.55]There are dogs in here.
[165:32.97]I think it's this right here.
[165:40.79]Well, there's a dog in the way, but you know what I mean?
[165:42.29]I think this is it.
[165:43.64]Let's check it.
[165:52.30]I don't... Is this... Is this... This isn't the right spot, dude.
[165:58.71]It's back down?
[165:59.83]How is this so difficult?
[166:19.71]Get the fuck away from me!
[166:21.00]Alright, right here?
[166:43.11]This is it.
[166:45.61]This is it.
[166:46.17]This is it.
[166:46.67]This is it.
[166:51.67]This is it right here.
[166:54.36]Yep.
[166:54.64]See the big rock on the right?
[166:57.46]Turn up your gamma.
[166:58.68]Okay, yeah, that's a good idea.
[167:28.48]There's like a big boulder behind him.
[167:34.11]Is that correct?
[167:43.61]Yeah, that's it right there.
[167:44.66]That's a bingo right now.
[167:46.02]That's literally, no, not a bingo, but you know what I mean?
[167:47.82]That's it right there.
[167:51.96]See the rock on the right?
[167:54.10]I'm claiming that square.
[168:01.71]Uh-oh.
[168:03.59]Uh-oh!
[168:10.25]Uh-oh.
[168:27.06]Alright, where are the boys?
[168:29.14]This is a big deal because I might win the drip contest.
[168:33.05]And if I win the drip contest, then we just got to get the boys to plus 10.
[168:35.25]What do you mean, uh-oh?
[168:52.10]What I mean by uh-oh is I mean, uh-oh, somebody might... Wow, that's not it.
[168:56.20]Somebody might win.
[168:59.86]Like, uh-oh, somebody's getting close.
[169:05.27]It's drip check time?
[169:06.05]Alright, where... I need to go and it's probably here.
[169:15.31]Drip check?
[169:16.53]Is it time for drip check?
[169:22.32]I wanted to see where I am.
[169:26.98]Drip check.
[169:29.46]okay drip check drip check hey uh hey drip check I found your painting by the way took me a while to get in the right spot but I found it hey uh Jerma hey Jerma drip check I am I'm aware and I've got some pretty good shit right now
[169:56.13]OK.
[169:57.53]So.
[169:59.05]Hey Jerma.
[170:01.09]Drip check.
[170:01.67]Alright.
[170:03.75]It's time.
[170:05.13]Yeah.
[170:06.84]By the time you responded, I could have killed four bosses.
[170:10.66]What do you got?
[170:13.02]I got the full hobo fit.
[170:17.02]I'm walking down the runway and I look homeless, but this actually cost thousands and thousands of dollars for me to look this homeless.
[170:25.82]Okay.
[170:28.84]Well, here's what I got.
[170:31.34]I get some good lighting.
[170:32.18]Let's make it daytime.
[170:34.56]Everything matches.
[170:35.50]The jewels, the gems match each other.
[170:41.44]The jewels, the gems?
[170:43.14]All my stuff matches.
[170:44.00]I got a beautiful gown on.
[170:46.32]I've got the dragon on the arm.
[170:48.14]That's a close one.
[170:53.04]Take a look at that.
[170:55.81]it's a close one I I mean I I look uh completely like I crawled out of the trash uh so I don't I don't really know who's gonna win this this is really up to anyone's interpretation let's see if the votes are in okay so how we're gonna this is by committee and yeah I don't know yours doesn't match what do you mean doesn't match
[171:23.22]There's a random, like, Haligtree guy helm.
[171:25.66]No, that's fucking sick.
[171:27.96]That doesn't match.
[171:28.96]Yes, it does.
[171:30.25]I'm in, like, a weird lighting.
[171:34.19]Okay, well, I'm fully immersed in the cave that my character lives in.
[171:39.49]Oh, yeah, let me go to Lyndell, where I belong.
[171:40.97]Alright, how do we do this?
[171:48.52]Because we... Do you want to... If we...
[171:52.14]Everybody that is in that channel, just give them a vote.
[171:57.03]Alright.
[171:57.23]We were doing this by committee.
[172:00.37]That's much better lighting.
[172:01.89]Are you kidding me?
[172:06.88]I think...
[172:08.59]I- I look regal, I look ready to go, everything.
[172:11.17]Like, look at the red on the vikespear and the red on the jewels.
[172:15.12]Gold from the halic tree helm.
[172:17.12]Into- well, it's the bird tree helm.
[172:19.84]The- there's browns inside of this intricate design that match the dragon's head.
[172:28.27]The boots are a light brown.
[172:30.67]You get the contrast with- Hey, hey, bruh, bruh.
[172:32.33]Bruh, you're in a fucking plain blue t-shirt.
[172:39.56]What do you got on?
[172:41.18]I don't know.
[172:41.54]I got, like, a sweater.
[172:42.78]I mean, it's more than one color.
[172:49.02]Alright.
[172:49.52]It's nothing, like, special, but... The committee?
[172:51.60]Should we talk about who the committee is?
[172:53.92]People are going to think it's biased.
[172:58.26]It's all of Jerma's mods.
[173:04.16]that's not true there is one person on my team and that's my wife and then it is uh wait one two three four five wait one yeah six people one is on my team what was your idea of combining the percentages with chats we could do it like that too
[173:27.43]Uh, yeah, if we do a slash poll, then I was going to say add up both numbers from our chats to, like, dissuade bias.
[173:35.27]Okay, so what do we got?
[173:37.77]I mean, well, before you do that, are we waiting for their vote?
[173:42.19]Or are we accepting the chat additive vote?
[173:45.87]So chat, should chat be another vote?
[173:48.33]Chat should be part of the committee.
[173:50.21]Oh, they get one.
[173:51.15]So chat should be one.
[173:53.11]Okay, slash poll.
[173:54.85]Setting it up on my channel.
[173:57.78]It's going to be, for me, a three minute poll.
[174:04.34]I'm looking over here right now and I'm seeing some very, very large discussions.
[174:09.12]There's a lot of deliberation going on.
[174:10.42]It's not like, oh, Jerma wins.
[174:11.48]I like him.
[174:13.26]There's deliberation going on.
[174:14.54]Wait, let me read from the mod Discord.
[174:19.87]Can we just pick Jerma already and get it over with?
[174:22.21]I have to go use the jet ski he got me.
[174:30.42]Fucking terrifying.
[174:33.84]I like jet skis.
[174:37.87]I've taken on this new hobby.
[174:39.17]It's pretty lame, though.
[174:41.11]Oh, yeah.
[174:41.65]I go jet ski riding once a week.
[174:43.35]You manipulated your friend being nice to you.
[174:50.44]Yeah.
[174:51.46]Alright.
[174:51.68]So what was the poll for me over here?
[174:53.76]86 to 14% for you.
[174:57.32]I'm sorry, dude.
[174:58.16]You're like, what are you...
[175:01.21]My chat is also voting you.
[175:03.57]Are they?
[175:03.91]Yeah, it's 66 to 34.
[175:06.32]No.
[175:09.60]But I have the full Igon set and everybody loves Igon.
[175:14.78]Curse you, Bill!
[175:17.57]Did you kill Igon?
[175:19.19]Yeah.
[175:20.63]Yeah.
[175:24.16]Okay, so what are we doing here?
[175:26.86]What are the mods saying?
[175:29.06]So we just call chat's vote one for this way?
[175:36.11]So chat has voted for me.
[175:44.94]I believed the horse riding for a sec, sad face.
[175:48.00]They're not even talking about the drip check anymore.
[175:51.28]They're just feeling betrayed.
[175:52.84]Okay, VRJosh is voting for you.
[175:56.97]You've got one from VRJosh.
[175:58.33]It's two to one right now.
[176:02.31]I think we just give you the square.
[176:03.59]You're winning.
[176:08.53]What else we got?
[176:09.77]We still need a few more votes.
[176:13.03]Where did you even get the Moog-like set, Farmer?
[176:17.20]Wouldn't you like to know?
[176:19.30]Did you go to Moog World?
[176:20.34]Uh, no.
[176:21.95]This is... Are you looking at my stream?
[176:25.26]I was.
[176:25.66]I had to close everything.
[176:26.64]I don't know.
[176:27.22]For some reason, my computer was upset.
[176:29.38]If you go inside of where the original Roundtable Hold is, this is the Albrecht robe.
[176:37.11]You get like the Albrecht hat.
[176:39.45]It's like his full set.
[176:42.07]And to confirm for me.
[176:45.51]Wait, I would have voted for Jerma if not for the hand puppet.
[176:50.37]Oh.
[176:50.87]This completes the look though.
[176:52.01]This is like I'm a dragon.
[176:53.33]I'm like for the Ur tree and I'm a friend of Godrick.
[176:57.22]Me and Godrick hang out.
[176:58.24]We smoke weed.
[176:59.50]This is like what this is.
[177:01.18]This is the timepiece.
[177:02.84]Come on.
[177:10.84]Alright.
[177:11.16]Okay.
[177:11.26]What if it was a torch?
[177:12.12]No, that's worse.
[177:13.07]I was going to say, where's your painting from?
[177:17.14]my painting yeah it's the if you go to you have to go I was gonna go kill dragon man and go down there you just have to get down to the finger place that is just right it's like right next to the Grace the finger the little like finger ruins right here yeah that's that's so far what a waste of time that's not
[177:43.95]You just go.
[177:44.93]Because I didn't kill Dragon Man.
[177:46.54]There was no reason for me to kill Dragon Man at all.
[177:49.70]Yeah, but if you wanted to kill Dragon, if you kill Dragon Man, just ran.
[177:53.00]Dragon Man is not that hard.
[177:53.99]Just kill Dragon Man.
[177:54.81]Just run over here and just run to here and then just ride by everything and you can go right there.
[177:59.47]Yeah, and I would have had to find the correct cliff.
[178:02.09]I gave you a fucking hint.
[178:03.53]Is that better or worse than I took a zero-lumination screenshot inside of a random cave?
[178:08.89]But I told you dog, and that's a dead giveaway because there's dogs right there.
[178:13.44]Yeah, but I don't... I gotta find out where... I don't know where the dog dungeon is.
[178:18.32]I had to find it.
[178:18.96]I was running around for like 20 minutes looking for it.
[178:21.91]It's the first dungeon in the game.
[178:25.32]You gotta know where the dog dungeon is.
[178:27.74]I know, like, where it is, but there's, like, four in that area.
[178:30.87]I just didn't know exactly which one it was.
[178:32.35]I went into all three of them, except for the one that I need to go into.
[178:35.05]Okay, that's better.
[178:36.07]That makes me feel better that you had to do some... Ster gave you... You gave me that hint on your own.
[178:43.78]By the way, I made sure in my screenshot that you could see the fingers in the corner.
[178:49.64]The fingers in the corner.
[178:50.76]The fingers are in the corner.
[178:52.26]It's like little fingers in the corner.
[178:53.54]It's like, ooh, what's that?
[178:56.06]Want me to show my... I can show my... In a minute, I will.
[179:04.68]I believe I just won the drip check.
[179:08.72]With a 100 to 1 vote.
[179:09.90]Looks like 100 people voted for me.
[179:14.57]We're doing 100%, so 100 voted for me and 1 voted for you.
[179:16.11]Jerma.
[179:16.27]Jerma.
[179:23.28]you deserve it I think you look really cute in that outfit and I didn't mean to bash your basic blue shirt you wear it well I admit defeat so things just got very interesting because do you just go for St. Trina getting plus 10 nobles sucks absolute that's gonna be a huge pain in the ass
[179:53.62]yeah it is I don't I don't know which one of these is a worse thing to do the you have to basically go to where St. Trina's thing is to even get plus like I don't know where you're getting the plus 10 from I mean you just need the glove award I mean we have the it's like dungeons and stuff to go get it I just need to find it
[180:17.56]Or do I want to... I'm calling for a game restart.
[180:20.80]I don't know why my computer is being real, real, real sussy.
[180:25.05]A game restart?
[180:26.15]Like you just need to... I need to return to desktop real quick.
[180:30.35]That's alright.
[180:30.91]I mean, we're not like in multiplayer.
[180:31.85]We can just pause for a minute.
[180:41.27]We can just chill.
[180:43.11]You can do your restart.
[180:47.27]I really thought I was going to lose in the first 30 minutes.
[180:51.97]I was certain of it.
[180:53.84]I was so sad.
[180:54.26]I was telling my chat that I'm going to line all of these up for St.
[180:58.58]Trina and then just not do it.
[181:01.34]Then he's going to panic and worry about it.
[181:03.12]I was hoping you would go try and do it to block and then I just was going to do other things.
[181:07.58]I I I just saw it was one when after The Binding of Isaac thing where I like fucking freaked out.
[181:13.58]I want to go kill the furnace Gollum, which was stupid.
[181:16.36]It took me like 15 minutes.
[181:18.57]Yeah, and then I noticed you had four and at that point I was like it's over.
[181:24.75]He's going to beat me and I started like you said I started panicking.
[181:26.99]I started freaking out.
[181:29.25]And then that's when I what did I do next?
[181:33.38]Honestly, the thing that actually saved the whole run for me was the most crunchies at one hour.
[181:40.57]The fact that we both had two.
[181:42.91]We both had like less than 20k.
[181:45.53]I just happened to pick one up in Lyndell like 20 seconds before we had to do the count.
[181:51.65]Man, I just, if I remembered where the graveyard was, I would have had like six.
[181:57.08]But I couldn't remember the starting area graveyard location.
[182:02.42]Oh man.
[182:05.58]Cool.
[182:06.70]Cool.
[182:08.82]Yeah, so here's the situation.
[182:11.90]You got a situation?
[182:13.88]What happens if neither of us do our two remaining squares?
[182:20.88]Like what if we just like it?
[182:22.22]What if it's going to take like so long?
[182:24.54]So are we just both running these down or what?
[182:27.60]Are you making a gentleman's bet?
[182:29.02]A gentleman's kind of promise that we don't do these two?
[182:33.22]I'm asking if like, I don't know what's on the table here.
[182:35.52]Or are you making a gentleman's bet to tell me not to do one of these so you're going to do it instead?
[182:41.36]And just kind of... It's going to be like an LOL moment.
[182:44.74]Well, I'm saying our remaining bingos are relatively difficult.
[182:52.19]And I don't... Like, when are you going to get a plus 10 Wandering Nobles?
[182:56.09]Don't try me.
[182:57.93]Okay.
[182:58.47]Alright.
[182:59.25]That's the answer I'm looking for.
[183:00.59]If you're going to say don't try me, then I guess I'm going to...
[183:05.90]Well, okay.
[183:06.86]What else?
[183:07.56]Oh, God.
[183:08.26]Well, maybe I'll do that now, too.
[183:11.68]What?
[183:11.86]Sprint to Trina?
[183:13.62]I could do that.
[183:14.54]I might run there and block you.
[183:16.40]When are you going to get a plus 10 nobles?
[183:19.74]I'm not.
[183:23.32]Let's be clear.
[183:24.48]I'm not.
[183:25.84]I don't know where the nobles are.
[183:27.32]I don't know where the plus 10 upgrades are.
[183:30.00]I'm not going to do it.
[183:30.90]So what is effectively happening right now is...
[183:36.11]We're both going to say, okay, dude, let's get going.
[183:38.85]And we're both going to freak out and desperately try to finish our bingos.
[183:43.68]Yeah.
[183:45.64]Okay.
[183:46.36]You ready?
[183:47.60]Are you good?
[183:49.30]I mean, I guess I'm ready.
[183:50.70]Okay.
[183:53.93]Good luck to you.
[183:54.55]Remember, you got to die to St. Trina 10 times.
[184:02.44]That too.
[184:03.06]Even if I beat Putrid Knight, I'm going to be in the queue.
[184:07.80]It is so far to get there.
[184:11.97]Okay.
[184:12.39]Well, hold on a second though.
[184:13.53]If you're going to make your way to St.
[184:16.67]Trina, you are going to be able to try the laser zone, which is a square.
[184:22.29]If you beat Putrid Knight with, I mean, you have two rows here.
[184:28.09]I only have one possible bingo.
[184:31.30]You're saying that I could do your, I could do the whole row on the bottom before you get a plus 10 noble.
[184:38.96]I honestly, man, I don't know because I don't even, I don't know what any of these glove wards are.
[184:43.08]I'm going to have to do like a bunch of dungeons.
[184:44.82]I'm going to have to go dungeon to dungeon.
[184:47.54]I'm going to have to kill the Frenzied Flame.
[184:49.94]You'd have to kill, you have to kill like two of like the harder DLC bosses.
[184:54.69]And you have to, by the way, one of them, you can't roll.
[184:57.43]What is your plan with that, by the way?
[185:00.11]I have the waypoint in front of Alana.
[185:03.46]And if I get a shield, I think I could do it.
[185:07.94]Alright.
[185:08.90]Are you all recalibrated?
[185:12.66]Yeah.
[185:13.26]Alright.
[185:13.58]Well, this is coming down here to the wire.
[185:14.82]Let's do it.
[185:16.28]Alright, dude.
[185:16.82]Good luck.
[185:19.07]See you later.
[185:20.51]No.
[185:20.85]Wait, wait.
[185:21.71]What's up?
[185:21.95]Love you.
[185:22.25]Awww.
[185:38.84]Awww.
[185:40.24]I gotta play.
[185:44.20]Say it back?
[185:45.58]Nah.
[185:55.73]Alright, okay.
[185:56.55]I think it's harder.
[185:58.59]Let's do it.
[186:00.37]Hey, can you mute already?
[186:02.11]Oh, what?
[186:02.73]I'm not muted in user reviews.
[186:04.91]Yeah, I know you're not saying it back.
[186:06.65]I know.
[186:06.99]I've been waiting for that shit my whole life.
[186:20.50]Okay.
[186:22.02]Let's go.
[186:30.94]Alright, let's go.
[186:31.64]Uh, glove wart.
[186:35.25]I already got him at plus one.
[186:37.95]I just have to do a dungeon in every zone.
[186:40.03]It'll be fine.
[186:40.73]It'll be easy.
[186:43.37]I have to... Hold on.
[186:44.05]This game is loud as hell.
[186:49.98]Hey, when was the last time you guys... I don't know why this popped in recently.
[186:54.50]When was the last time you guys have heard anybody do the phrase?
[186:59.20]Chica wow wow.
[187:02.34]That used to happen like every fucking 15 minutes everywhere.
[187:06.48]Like I have not heard that in probably 15 years.
[187:12.93]No one does that.
[187:13.55]Like it used to be that was like the funny thing to do.
[187:16.13]That was the hilarious joke that everybody did.
[187:18.13]I've not heard that in 15 years.
[187:20.89]It was a terrible joke.
[187:21.77]I'm glad it's gone.
[187:25.91]That only ever happened on Family Guy.
[187:38.14]Alright, I have... I have what is effectively the easier route.
[187:42.38]So I can't just be a dickhead and mess this all up.
[187:49.34]But I do have to find Glovewort.
[187:51.13]I need Glovewort 2.
[187:51.97]This is still 1.
[188:06.15]That, by the way, they have to, oh, by the way.
[188:08.17]Oh, that would have been sick for the drip contest.
[188:16.70]I make that sound every time you turn on your camera.
[188:18.86]Can we time that person out for like, let's just 60 years.
[188:22.00]That sounds good to me.
[188:29.01]I could go get the bell bearings, but that would honestly require me to know where the bell bearings are.
[188:33.83]And I do not know.
[188:37.65]Now, sure, I could find them.
[188:40.47]I have an idea of where they would be, but I need, I think it's the grave glove wart bells.
[188:45.75]But honest to goodness, I think it's probably just easier for me to go to some of these dungeons that have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and just do it.
[188:56.96]Okay, there it is.
[188:57.46]There it is.
[188:57.74]I'm out.
[188:58.02]I'm out.
[188:58.30]I'm out.
[188:58.75]I'm out.
[188:59.29]I'm done already.
[189:00.81]I just got it.
[189:02.07]Okay.
[189:03.67]I need another dungeon that's like a level two dungeon.
[189:14.26]You know, just kill me.
[189:15.32]Just get me out of here.
[189:18.22]Where's the dark sign?
[189:19.48]Look at how many crunchies I have now.
[189:26.36]Good info, OK?
[189:29.12]Where's the dark sign?
[189:30.94]There it is.
[189:31.20]Alright, I have the nobles now.
[189:38.57]I need to OK, I need.
[189:40.83]Alright, first of all, I need to go find.
[189:48.53]Where is she?
[189:49.43]She's like.
[189:52.71]She's like up here.
[189:55.57]I don't remember where she is.
[189:57.93]She's in like, she's in a shack.
[190:00.99]She's like sitting down in a shack.
[190:02.99]But I did already kill Godrick.
[190:06.06]Wait a minute.
[190:06.44]Am I softlocked?
[190:21.08]I think it's right there.
[190:22.16]I actually don't know.
[190:24.04]See, I got a lot of shit to do.
[190:25.54]I have a lot of shit I have to do here.
[190:27.12]I think it's that one.
[190:29.24]I think it's four.
[190:33.54]She might just be there now, right?
[190:34.88]Hold on.
[190:35.12]Let me just see if she's there.
[190:38.22]Check.
[190:44.00]I don't think she's here, though.
[190:47.96]Ah, welcome to the round table.
[190:52.65]Remember, I'm your senior.
[190:55.59]And as a senior, what I say goes, mate.
[191:00.75]She's here.
[191:01.33]Okay, we're good.
[191:01.97]Okay.
[191:02.11]Alright, what have I got now?
[191:23.01]Okay, it is... Grave Glovewort.
[191:28.90]I need... I'm gonna eat my crunchies.
[191:30.82]Okay.
[191:43.81]I need two.
[191:48.03]Do I have... I don't... Can you even... You might be able to buy them from the twin maidens over here.
[192:06.65]No, I think you need to actually get the...
[192:12.50]Okay, that's fine.
[192:13.38]I have no idea where they are, but I just have to go to a couple of dungeons.
[192:17.66]So that's a dungeon one.
[192:18.84]Where's like another dungeon that would have them?
[192:23.97]Maybe the one I was in before.
[192:25.01]I need to mark these that I was in them already.
[192:28.37]Because these are going to have level one.
[192:31.75]Maybe like in Caelid somewhere.
[192:37.64]Down here.
[192:41.31]Dude, I don't know where any of these dungeons are that would have these things.
[192:45.93]The hernia.
[192:54.96]There's one here, but that's... This is a Smithing Stone cave.
[193:00.11]That is a Smithing Stone cave.
[193:08.31]I think there's one like here.
[193:10.77]Right?
[193:12.43]Somewhere over there.
[193:13.40]Let's just go for it.
[193:14.46]I know there's one over there somewhere.
[193:15.48]I'll find one.
[193:20.44]Alright, what boss do I want them to kill?
[193:37.48]I feel like not Rennala.
[193:40.76]I don't think it's Rennala.
[193:41.74]I fucked up so bad.
[193:42.78]I should have had him kill Godrick or Margit.
[193:45.02]I freaked out in the beginning.
[193:53.46]You didn't buy the bell?
[193:54.36]Yeah, it's alright.
[193:54.98]I can get it later.
[194:00.89]Does it have to be a Remembrance boss?
[194:03.49]I think that's fair.
[194:06.39]I think that's fair.
[194:15.12]No, Soldier of Godrick is off limits.
[194:17.19]We cannot do anything with Soldier of Godrick.
[194:19.63]We already made that gentleman's rule.
[194:27.14]Okay, is there one?
[194:28.78]There's one right here.
[194:29.60]There's like a mausoleum down here or something, right?
[194:40.58]Is there something down here?
[194:48.25]There isn't anything down here, is there?
[194:52.43]Am I crazy?
[195:03.61]Shit.
[195:09.21]OK, well there's not one in there.
[195:10.69]I thought there was one right in the middle of the Lake Lake area.
[195:14.95]OK, what about down here?
[195:25.08]I have not played the base game in so long.
[195:31.44]At least four or five days.
[195:44.54]OK, wait, I think this one here.
[195:48.40]But right here.
[195:53.33]Wait, this is.
[195:53.97]It's like it's a crank, isn't it?
[195:56.97]I think this is a crank.
[196:07.38]OK.
[196:16.44]Shit.
[196:18.90]I don't know where any dungeons are.
[196:20.16]I kind of have to be here though.
[196:27.63]See, there's got to be like one like here or something, right?
[196:31.15]Like under this bridge or something or down.
[196:33.22]I just have to go look.
[196:34.22]I have to look.
[196:35.22]I have to just go look around.
[196:46.60]Uh, yeah, I could go down into like CO, CO free or whatever it is.
[196:50.42]Or Nokron.
[196:52.48]That's another thing.
[196:53.08]I gotta remember how to get down there too.
[196:54.24]I feel like there's one down here.
[196:59.47]Let me get this Grace.
[197:14.27]Is looking it up not allowed?
[197:16.65]I would say that's not allowed.
[197:17.63]Because I think part of the difficulty for me right now is not so much I have to kill a boss or anything, is just finding a bunch, just going to where these dungeons are.
[197:35.80]And it's like, are you talking about like July of 2022?
[197:43.53]Now, I've played through the game since then, but there's so much stuff in the game that's hard to remember where everything even is.
[197:50.88]And without kind of, you know, oh, what's in that corner?
[197:53.06]What's it?
[197:53.34]We're against time right now.
[198:16.43]Alright, leave me alone.
[198:17.15]I'm far enough away.
[198:21.91]OK.
[198:23.07]Maybe like down in here.
[198:24.71]This is where one of these memory stone things is.
[198:31.45]No.
[198:34.39]Not sure.
[198:44.23]You just kind of have to run along every single like wall.
[198:53.17]I know this one down in Redan's area, but I have to kill Redan, which I don't really want to.
[198:56.77]I mean, I guess I could.
[198:57.55]Is there one this one back here, isn't there?
[199:09.44]That is this one right here, right?
[199:14.51]Shit.
[199:26.50]Shit.
[199:29.56]I don't know where anything is.
[199:30.84]I can get a plus 9 and a plus 10 from the DLC.
[199:50.96]I just don't know.
[199:51.50]It's one of those things where if you know, you know where they are.
[199:59.65]If you don't, you may as well just be like kind of exploring the game and looking for them again for the first time.
[200:09.25]Is this like, okay, what about under the bridge over here?
[200:20.95]Just look it up on your phone.
[200:23.86]The DLC dungeons have all kinds of levels of them.
[200:26.58]That's true.
[200:28.28]That is really true.
[200:29.44]The fuck?
[201:01.03]I think I might actually have to go.
[201:02.21]I think DLC dungeons where it's at.
[201:04.67]I think I'm going to have to do that and just kind of play through it and get some stuff.
[201:08.01]Because I don't, guys, I don't know.
[201:11.84]I don't know where any of this shit is.
[201:14.30]Okay.
[201:15.88]I know there's a dungeon.
[201:21.26]Isn't there one right here?
[201:22.90]No, it's this one.
[201:23.80]I already did it.
[201:24.80]I picked up a couple of things.
[201:31.08]I kind of ran through it.
[201:33.28]Is there shit in the dragon pit?
[201:34.26]There might be shit in the dragon pit.
[201:43.24]Yeah, in the DLC, there's a ton of them down on the coast.
[201:48.73]But is there some here too?
[201:49.95]There probably is a few in here.
[201:51.11]Maybe there's not because it's not like a technically like a cemetery.
[201:56.15]Yeah, it's not.
[201:58.47]I don't think it's going to work out.
[201:59.65]Yep.
[202:01.89]Because this is not like a cemetery.
[202:04.03]It's like a dragon pit.
[202:05.53]But hold on.
[202:05.83]What is... No.
[202:08.19]These are smithing stones.
[202:14.64]Okay.
[202:15.40]I'm going to go down here.
[202:19.82]Because there's all those things down here.
[202:21.17]But I need like +2, three, four, five, six...
[202:29.31]Okay, to get there, you got to go like down here, I think.
[202:34.14]I think that's correct.
[202:38.94]Because you go in here, right?
[202:44.89]Fuck, I don't remember.
[202:45.65]I think that's accurate.
[202:49.89]Like around here?
[202:50.64]I don't know.
[203:00.45]There's not much time left, Jerma.
[203:02.27]I have as much time for him to go kill putrid... Oh, okay.
[203:07.16]It's him.
[203:07.64]Yeah, I could go to the... Like, wait a minute.
[203:16.77]Let me try this one thing.
[203:17.71]Let me try one thing.
[203:23.11]Alright, I got to lock in and I'm not going to look at chat for a little bit because I need to pay attention.
[203:27.01]So let's go.
[203:28.59]I would not need my map.
[203:30.05]I need my map.
[203:30.71]I need my map, but I can't get it because I'm surrounded by things.
[203:39.51]Is that guy still banned for 60 years?
[203:44.78]Well, 60 goldfish years.
[203:48.02]Which is.
[203:51.94]Longer.
[203:56.89]Alright, get away from me.
[203:57.51]I need to look.
[204:00.27]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[204:01.43]Okay.
[204:02.41]I need to like... Down... Too many things to do!
[204:08.86]Dude, I know.
[204:16.52]I'm trying to like just follow one path.
[204:30.23]Do I get down there?
[204:36.89]I feel like it's you have to go through the castle.
[204:40.30]It's like here, isn't it?
[204:45.86]As you go down and then that's the I think this is the right waterfall to go down.
[204:52.88]It was a perfect Jupiter.
[205:04.68]Don't do that.
[205:16.61]Now it's in it.
[205:18.71]This ain't it.
[205:21.86]I think I have to go through castle lenses and then turn and go down.
[205:35.73]It's funny too, because being under pressure to find something immediately when it's like, wait a minute.
[205:41.02]How do you do that?
[205:43.00]I haven't done that in a while.
[205:44.00]Where do I go?
[205:44.58]It's like, oh shit.
[205:48.20]Okay.
[205:50.92]I feel like you have to go up here and it's like over this way.
[205:54.90]You jump like down from Castellensis somehow.
[206:04.30]This, I could probably try down here.
[206:05.89]You should play Warframe.
[206:16.22]How are you guys doing perfect Jupiters?
[206:26.36]The one thing I remember about the DLC, playing through it, is there is one extraordinarily specific way to go anywhere.
[206:34.83]And I do not remember where that way is.
[206:39.66]So we're just going to have to try to go through Castle Lensis, and I'm just going to say, fuck it, whatever, let's see if I can do it.
[207:04.33]Is that the big dragon wing?
[207:05.59]Yeah, I don't even I don't know how to get to the dragon wing.
[207:07.51]I'm not I can't even get that far.
[207:08.67]I feel like it's just like an area to the out like in castle lenses where you can go down like the waterfall.
[207:26.66]I remember beating Rolana.
[207:28.75]And that was the member I was like, oh, look, it goes down.
[207:30.99]It goes down.
[207:31.79]It was like, yeah, it does go down.
[207:34.01]That was after Rolana.
[207:35.11]I feel like it's in here somewhere.
[207:37.81]Because this will get me some plus eights and plus nines.
[207:45.99]You know, give me this, Grace.
[207:50.54]Why am I so blurry?
[207:52.18]Oh, my camera is a piece of shit and I don't care about making another one.
[207:56.74]Yeah, is it?
[207:57.60]There's the.
[207:58.90]OK, hold on.
[208:02.89]I'm gonna die if I drop here.
[208:03.87]This death.
[208:09.91]We're good, OK?
[208:13.40]This right?
[208:26.29]It's not shit.
[208:29.53]Who's even in here?
[208:33.46]Oh shit, that's actually.
[208:35.86]I'll put it on.
[208:36.56]Why not?
[208:45.51]I don't know where to go.
[209:11.81]oh right right right right right you after you kill right okay after you kill the dragon man it's not just like the end of the dungeon it's like oh hey by the way keep going and here's the next uh it's not like teleport to the entrance right oh my god right I am so annoyed about that okay let's go
[209:42.22]Well, giving Ster plenty of time to go kill Putridite.
[209:48.40]For all I know, Ster is saying the same shit going.
[209:50.54]I don't know where the fuck to go.
[209:51.30]I don't know where I'm going.
[209:52.66]I lost.
[209:52.96]I don't know where I'm going.
[209:53.90]It's over.
[209:55.60]He's probably saying the same stuff.
[210:00.02]Oh my god.
[210:01.34]Don't kill me.
[210:01.94]I don't want to start over this thing again.
[210:03.24]Please don't.
[210:07.63]Time to bring out the lighter.
[210:13.43]That was just put there.
[210:14.35]I remember being like, hey, Ster, how do you feel about one of the squares being fart into a lighter while screaming for the Frenzied Flame?
[210:23.52]And he laughed for a second, and he just is like, none of us are doing that.
[210:28.42]I was like, yeah, but what if it came down to winning?
[210:32.18]And he's like, okay, true.
[210:36.89]If that was the last square left...
[210:45.34]right okay yeah yep yep yep yep that's how you get down here and then you can get to the coast and then you can go around okay right it's so funny because just processing information me and Ster just talked about how from my from my um screenshot he would have had to just do this or there's another way to get down there if he would have killed Rellana
[211:12.26]OK, let's go.
[211:13.98]I need a dungeon.
[211:15.16]I need.
[211:16.32]That's right there.
[211:18.53]That's kind of cool.
[211:19.03]Alright, let's go.
[211:27.53]I'm not fighting any of this.
[211:32.36]It should have been the center square.
[211:33.92]OK, we just didn't run by.
[211:38.18]I'm not fighting this.
[211:45.12]No intercept Ster.
[211:48.76]Part of me almost like wants to, but I feel like I'm close to being able to get what I need.
[212:16.56]Okay, yep.
[212:17.10]Then I can go around here.
[212:18.76]Yes, yes, yes.
[212:23.32]In a time long past.
[212:26.64]Bael!
[212:28.88]The gates of Sessaron have been closed for eons.
[212:32.83]And you shall not open them now.
[212:35.29]Edath!
[212:37.41]Warrior, picture you on the frog.
[212:39.19]It would be the fool and you'll come.
[212:44.79]I'll- I'll take your position into consideration.
[212:59.41]Best fucking game ever!
[213:22.38]There it is.
[213:23.52]There it is.
[213:25.97]There it is.
[213:26.57]Let's go.
[213:27.59]Everybody say let's go in the chat.
[213:28.75]Everyone will get wicked hyped up for us.
[213:33.49]Yeah.
[213:34.31]Yeah.
[213:34.87]Let's go.
[213:35.65]Let's hear it.
[213:36.40]Yeah.
[213:36.70]Say it.
[213:38.30]Don't fucking say it.
[213:39.00]Time everybody out that says that.
[213:47.99]Alright.
[213:52.18]He has to go, like, unlock Messmer's castle.
[213:55.86]Ster probably has no hair left.
[213:58.22]It's probably all clumped out of pieces where he's ripped out of his head.
[214:03.96]I think I've got- I can just sit here and just, like, tell dumb, shitty jokes to you guys.
[214:07.72]This is fuckin' way better.
[214:12.34]Ster is bright red, screaming at the fuckin' hippo, just like... It's probably awful over there.
[214:24.42]Alright.
[214:25.96]Uh, the Grace is like here.
[214:33.09]There are tears just streaming down his face.
[214:37.35]I should have, I should have, I should have said that I should have done the nobles.
[214:40.47]I can't even talk.
[214:44.37]Yeah.
[214:44.87]I'm, I'm, I'm in a way better position.
[214:57.82]This is Cope.
[214:58.66]Yeah, I know.
[215:01.64]Alright.
[215:04.02]How does one get down from here now?
[215:07.16]Let's figure it out.
[215:08.54]I just gotta go collect a bunch of shit.
[215:14.03]And then I gotta find like a dungeon in Liurnia.
[215:18.03]And then I have to kill, I don't know, what boss should I kill?
[215:21.09]Rinala?
[215:21.59]Rinala might be hard.
[215:27.33]Book book.
[215:32.83]I'm kind of just like playing the game right now.
[215:38.00]There we go.
[215:43.02]Wait.
[215:49.64]Shit.
[215:56.35]How the fuck do I get down here?
[216:01.71]Over there?
[216:08.50]You need to go 10 times faster, dude.
[216:10.30]I know, but it's... This is the worst one for me to pick.
[216:13.66]Oh, hey, Jeremy.
[216:16.20]Hey, hey.
[216:17.30]Please go do the thing where you have to explore the entire world.
[216:23.64]I should have just farted into the lighter at the very beginning.
[216:26.42]I thought about it too.
[216:27.16]I was like, you know what?
[216:27.76]Fuck it.
[216:28.18]Who cares?
[216:28.64]Do I really care?
[216:29.62]Oh man, I can't believe how he's gross.
[216:31.88]I don't care.
[216:32.40]I don't give a shit what you think about me, okay?
[216:37.34]Why did I not just fart into the lighter?
[216:40.97]I would have had such an advantage.
[216:42.07]I would have killed Margaret with a blindfold on.
[216:44.05]I would have then grinded for runes.
[216:46.19]He would have freaked out.
[216:50.93]Don't ever fucking do that.
[216:51.79]Don't try this at home.
[216:52.99]You're professional idiots.
[216:58.12]You're retired anyways.
[217:04.06]Wow, dude, you're retired and he just like... He's like being like... He's like being weird on stream.
[217:09.42]I don't like him anymore.
[217:10.61]Here it is, right here.
[217:15.93]Alright, start the collecting.
[217:18.27]Great.
[217:20.19]Grave Glove Ward.
[217:21.41]We can get them to plus 10.
[217:23.97]Good.
[217:24.21]Okay.
[217:53.85]Alright, it's time.
[217:55.62]I'm pivoting right now.
[217:57.00]Are there plus eights and plus nines down here?
[217:59.02]Or am I about to have ADHD and just turn around and do something else?
[218:09.42]There's like a plus eight, a plus nine, a plus nine.
[218:11.78]I think there is.
[218:12.34]And then I just got to go to like Altus.
[218:17.61]Lock in, man.
[218:18.67]Lock in.
[218:19.35]Stop being so comfortable.
[218:20.31]Ster is... Ster probably has music playing right now.
[218:23.87]Like... He's locked in and he's just fucking grinding for runes and shit.
[218:31.28]And I'm sitting there going, hey, maybe I should have farted into the lighter.
[218:34.50]Oops, I fell off the cliff.
[218:36.04]Like, I... Lock in.
[218:37.66]Lock in right now.
[218:38.84]You're not doing it yet.
[218:39.62]You haven't locked in yet.
[218:40.56]Do it now.
[218:41.78]Lock in right now or I'm going to be very upset.
[218:47.13]I already have one of those.
[218:53.18]Ster's got like fucking techno music blasting like.
[218:55.98]He probably already killed the frenzy flame and he just forgot to fucking mark it.
[219:01.79]I think there's one up there.
[219:16.70]There's one behind me.
[219:17.38]Alright, what is this one?
[219:27.71]Okay, Grave Glove Ward 9.
[219:29.85]Almost.
[219:30.25]We're getting there.
[219:31.13]We're not there yet, but we're getting there.
[219:32.47]Is this one 8?
[219:33.43]Oh, whoops.
[219:53.15]He only has probably like two Skadoo fragments as well.
[219:59.50]Putridite's going to be such a pain in the ass.
[220:03.30]Okay, I need eight.
[220:05.60]Okay, I have too many of these.
[220:11.82]I'm sorry.
[220:12.34]Is this one eight over here?
[220:19.68]Somebody do the math on that because that I don't understand what just happened.
[220:24.24]It's like 15 feet in the air.
[220:35.19]What the- what?
[220:46.04]We've been going for four hours, by the way.
[220:48.16]We have a whole nother board.
[221:05.94]By the way, I just looked over at the second board.
[221:07.98]I haven't seen it in a while.
[221:11.38]Kill the first boss in Binding of Isaac is still on it.
[221:14.69]I think we should take that off.
[221:21.94]Okay, there's one, there's a couple here.
[221:35.29]Get away from me.
[221:36.83]Why are these things hostile?
[221:37.67]Okay, I gotta go up that way and around.
[221:45.05]I think there's an aide over there.
[221:53.81]You guys are probably feeding so much shit to him right now.
[221:55.91]Being like, dude, he is not even close.
[221:57.43]You got plenty of time.
[221:59.97]And you'd be annoyingly right.
[222:07.64]Is there, like, a way down here?
[222:17.01]I gotta go with the pivot.
[222:20.25]Okay, I need... Where in Altus is shit?
[222:24.89]Like, probably right here.
[222:26.89]Right here.
[222:27.59]I gotta pivot.
[222:28.16]I have to.
[222:28.66]I have to.
[222:29.12]This is... I have nine and a ten.
[222:41.06]You know, I also thought about making a pre-recorded video where, like, I have a little corner webcam and press, like, a play the video button.
[222:47.48]And I lean back and go, for the Frenzied Flame!
[222:50.36]And I edit in, like, a huge fireball coming out of my ass.
[222:56.50]I was so close to doing it, but I was like, nah, never mind.
[222:59.30]We're not doing that.
[223:00.02]Alright, I think this one right here.
[223:09.86]This is going to kill me.
[223:11.02]It's going to kill me.
[223:12.55]Oh my how did that not kill me and me falling down like a little a couple of steps did.
[223:21.78]Is there not one down here?
[223:24.40]No way.
[223:43.52]How is there not one?
[223:45.09]I don't remember anything of the base game.
[224:02.75]Here?
[224:05.31]Here?
[224:08.07]Here?
[224:08.43]I don't know.
[224:18.69]I could also go to... Yeah, I could go underground.
[224:21.55]Seofra might be the play, actually.
[224:23.77]Alright, if I don't run into a dungeon in the next three minutes, I'm just going to Seofra.
[224:30.97]Alright, is it here?
[224:43.58]There's a Grace here.
[225:12.73]Where is a dungeon in this whole game?
[225:42.00]Yeah, bro, look for the pointing statues.
[225:47.36]It's so annoying how true that is.
[225:49.30]Just because I don't know.
[225:55.18]Oh, fuck you.
[225:56.30]Come on.
[226:04.77]We should pull over and ask for directions.
[226:09.34]There's like six million square footage of yardage in this game.
[226:18.89]I don't know.
[226:19.47]I don't know what any of these are.
[226:20.43]I never would have remembered anyways because I was fucking screaming on stream when I beat them.
[226:46.76]How is then?
[226:47.38]There is one right here.
[226:49.08]Where is it?
[226:52.06]He's gonna win.
[226:57.72]He's gonna win.
[226:58.88]I have to go to see Ofra.
[227:00.26]It's the only way.
[227:00.86]It's the only way.
[227:06.65]I'll be running around like an asshole for the next 30 minutes.
[227:12.90]The little lava spots are dungeons, but those are Smithing Stone dungeons for the most part.
[227:18.74]I need the cemetery kind of mausoleum type dungeons.
[227:29.92]You can still win.
[227:31.09]I know I can.
[227:32.23]I need six or I need seven grave glove wards.
[227:37.09]I need a two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[227:41.07]Oh my God, it's gonna take fucking forever.
[227:43.98]I effectively need to play through the entire game.
[227:47.38]I have to play through the entire game of Elden Ring.
[227:51.71]Or know where the bell bearings are.
[227:53.49]And that's not going to happen.
[227:54.43]I don't know where the fuck those are.
[227:55.33]Alright.
[228:02.41]Let me... Do I have a map?
[228:04.33]Seofra is down here.
[228:05.80]Is Seofra from here down or is it from Limgrave down?
[228:19.21]I think you can get there from here too.
[228:20.53]There's one in the Limgrave.
[228:30.64]There's one here too.
[228:31.46]I thought this was going to be easy.
[228:37.12]Well, if you know where things are, it's easy.
[228:54.73]What even is this over here?
[229:01.21]Chat knows everything?
[229:02.53]I am avoiding looking at a lot of chat messages because I don't want to be... Look, I have to do this on my own.
[229:08.41]I can't be like, hey guys, where's glove bell bearing one, glove bell bearing two and three?
[229:13.02]No, that's cheating.
[229:15.80]I'm trying to avoid a lot of messages.
[229:17.86]I'm just going for it.
[229:18.70]I'm just trying to do it.
[229:22.92]I gotta do it with my own brain.
[229:28.42]What does this take you?
[229:32.91]No, where does this take you?
[229:41.89]Weirdly opened by itself.
[229:46.25]This is the Ainsel River.
[229:58.04]I think there is a bunch down here though.
[230:00.36]I just have to be down here.
[230:01.44]Should have did this at the very beginning.
[230:04.22]The hell was I thinking?
[230:16.13]Ster is powering up.
[230:24.11]What does that mean?
[230:27.48]Okay.
[230:32.54]Oh, this ain't right either.
[230:38.34]He already gave me the Grace.
[230:44.75]Ster doesn't know that he gave me the Grace.
[230:46.49]Ster doesn't know that he gave me the Grace.
[230:49.81]Time to win.
[230:50.61]Time to win.
[230:51.39]Time to win.
[230:51.93]Just explore this whole zone.
[231:12.35]Where's the Glove Ward?
[231:13.13]There's no Glove Ward in here!
[231:28.50]Star just did the fart.
[231:30.00]No, he did not.
[231:47.65]There's no glove ward here.
[231:48.78]Dude, where is the glove ward?
[232:07.26]He farted on stream.
[232:09.17]I don't care if Ster farted.
[232:10.73]He didn't fart and scream for the Frenzied Flame.
[232:16.71]OK, I guess maybe just I don't know.
[232:26.67]He was thinking it.
[232:33.50]How is it possible that I have not come across one?
[232:36.02]I swear they will.
[232:37.52]I remember avoiding them because there were so many of them.
[232:40.64]I don't see any anymore.
[232:43.96]Some mushrooms.
[232:56.15]It's a bunch of leaves.
[232:59.27]It's a bunch of leaves.
[233:15.41]I don't remember a single glove ward being down here, actually.
[233:22.56]I need that one.
[233:23.62]Okay, we have a +2 now.
[233:33.84]Wait, was that the right one?
[233:37.28]Get away from me.
[233:38.82]This is Ghost Glovewort.
[233:40.06]This ain't even the right stuff.
[233:42.16]This is the wrong one.
[233:43.16]This is the wrong one.
[233:47.94]They're going to all be Ghost Glovewort.
[233:51.98]I have to go into a dungeon.
[233:54.99]But I don't know where any of them are.
[234:02.99]Son of a gun.
[234:05.83]Son of a gun.
[234:24.83]How are you so bad?
[234:27.40]Bro, I haven't played through the base game in probably- since you were- in probably in fucking diapers, okay?
[234:40.07]That's like assuming you are four.
[234:43.39]Uh... I- I'm assuming that you are four years- five years old, I guess?
[234:49.32]I don't know what you- what you're doing here, but- It's Ghost Love War 2, you guys screwed me over!
[235:05.72]Oh shit, I want to like look at Ster stream so bad because I don't know if he's struggling or not.
[235:10.26]I am struggling.
[235:16.62]These are, this is ghost lovewort.
[235:18.64]I have to, I have to just.
[235:28.31]I need to find a dungeon.
[235:32.75]This is a dungeon here, but it's a Smithing Stone dungeon.
[235:34.99]It's not the right one.
[235:36.87]I'm gonna have to walk.
[235:37.81]I'm gonna have to walk around the perimeter.
[235:41.51]Over and over again.
[235:42.41]Dude, I have no idea.
[235:46.41]I have to do it though.
[235:47.75]What the hell else am I gonna do?
[235:51.85]Good luck, man.
[235:53.43]Okay, I'm... I'm... Let's go.
[236:08.24]Why don't you just Google it?
[236:09.80]If I just Google it, then I just win.
[236:13.08]The whole point of me needing to do this was so Ster could spend like the next hour going down to St.
[236:17.55]Trina and kill Future Knight.
[236:21.27]Alright, lock in.
[236:55.67]I have nine and ten.
[236:56.67]I have one.
[236:57.41]I just need the little shitty ones in between.
[237:02.11]Which is just... God, go f... Oh my goodness.
[237:06.05]They're not... That wasn't what I wanted. ...
[238:08.29]Are there no dungeons down here?
[238:09.78]I swear there's one over here.
[238:17.76]I know where one is in the Weeping Peninsula.
[238:21.19]But I... What the heck?
[238:26.07]I don't know where anything is.
[238:35.12]Should've just went to St.
[238:35.92]Trina to try to kill Putrid Knight before Ster because I can do that.
[238:41.73]Instead of looking at a map upside down on a road trip.
[238:48.59]While mom and dad are trying to figure out where the hell to go.
[238:52.50]And nobody knows where to go.
[238:56.14]I don't know where to go.
[239:00.00]All I remember from these dungeons is they're like little tiny doors embedded into the walls.
[239:08.78]And I can't even look at my map because a dog was chasing me an hour ago.
[239:33.68]Thank you.
[240:03.03]I'm just going to go straight.
[240:05.33]There's got to be one.
[240:06.64]Eventually.
[240:07.32]This is not it.
[240:12.56]Why is the cam so greasy?
[240:13.72]I don't know.
[240:14.80]I was eating chips and rubbed my fingers all over it.
[240:33.76]But like in here.
[240:39.13]Up here maybe?
[240:39.85]Can you imagine being on a road trip?
[240:50.45]And... It's just every 10 to 20 seconds... Mom or dad just goes... I have no idea where the fuck I'm going.
[241:00.74]How am I supposed to know there's roads everywhere?
[241:03.58]There's roads in every state.
[241:05.54]There's 25 different highways.
[241:07.64]How am I supposed to know how to get to Idaho from here?
[241:12.37]I don't know.
[241:12.89]Dad, we're driving south.
[241:22.81]We're on the southern highway.
[241:24.73]How do you even know that?
[241:28.62]There's no way you would possibly know.
[241:31.32]Just shut up.
[241:31.90]It's really quiet back there.
[241:34.59]Where am I going?
[241:35.93]No, wrong way.
[241:37.67]I need to go, like, down there.
[241:43.59]I'm pretty sure the last sign said you were heading towards California.
[241:48.17]California?
[241:48.77]I don't even know what that is.
[241:51.10]I haven't been to California in a couple years when I went there a while ago.
[241:55.54]I don't know where it is on a map.
[241:58.90]Last time I went to California was, like, probably a few years ago.
[242:01.12]I don't know where that is.
[242:13.16]Alright, this guy, I feel like I'm close to one right now.
[242:15.28]This is definitely one right here somewhere.
[242:19.04]What is sticking out of my head?
[242:21.39]No, I need to look at my map.
[242:22.53]Don't die here to the regular enemies.
[242:27.17]I was just talking to chat.
[242:29.65]I'm just so lost.
[242:43.76]Alright, lock in.
[242:44.54]I'm not looking at chat for 20 minutes.
[242:45.80]Let's go.
[242:56.04]Just follow the fucking breadcrumbs, you idiot.
[244:07.69]Is there not one over here?
[244:08.71]Shit!
[244:42.93]This is so funny.
[244:43.59]I feel like it's hard to just not stumble upon these things.
[244:46.04]That's what I'm saying.
[244:47.60]I've been like walking against walls for 20 minutes.
[244:52.32]How have I not come across one single dungeon?
[244:59.37]Son of a gun.
[245:09.06]You already found one?
[245:10.06]I found one!
[245:11.38]But it has Glovewort 1 and 2 in it.
[245:13.20]I need 3 and 4, so I need to do a dungeon in Laurnia.
[245:17.96]I need 2, 3, 4.
[245:18.50]Yeah, this is a Smithing Stone dungeon, is not it?
[245:27.78]They're like hidden.
[245:36.18]Right here?
[245:39.39]There has to be one right there.
[245:41.15]If there isn't, then I'm going to be very upset.
[245:46.13]Alright.
[245:46.49]I don't have a Grace.
[245:48.45]Okay.
[245:48.75]Walk back up the hill.
[245:50.63]Around here.
[245:52.47]That way.
[245:53.63]So I need to up the hill.
[245:55.03]Five.
[245:57.29]Is he like at attempt number five versus future knight?
[246:06.82]Jerm is pointing at a map and guessing.
[246:08.44]That's kind of what I have to do right now.
[246:12.06]My hair is all messed up.
[246:18.43]My hair is all messed up.
[246:19.83]I'm sweaty.
[246:21.65]I'm annoyed.
[246:22.41]Okay.
[246:26.05]Why can I not see?
[246:29.85]What is going on?
[246:31.27]Stop it!
[246:33.39]Where is my mouse?
[246:34.21]What is going on?
[246:37.95]Okay.
[246:38.89]That has to be a dungeon there.
[246:40.15]And then I need... Like, 2, 3, 4... I have 9, 10.
[246:46.42]Straight towards 3.
[246:46.98]Go.
[246:47.42]Alright, if I tell you guys what percentage... Like, 0 to 100 is Ster... To completing his goal... What would you say it is?
[247:00.29]Like, 0 to 100...
[247:09.96]That's a lot of different numbers.
[247:16.84]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[247:18.32]Stop talking to chat.
[247:19.98]Where am I going?
[247:21.24]Four, okay.
[247:36.16]Wait, wait, wait.
[247:36.98]I just got pinged.
[247:37.68]We just got pinged.
[247:42.95]Me and Stirbolts just got pinged.
[247:46.91]You guys want to have a truce?
[247:49.62]Jerma can Google if Ster is allowed to get a new weapon.
[247:55.56]Okay, that tells me that Ster's not having a good time.
[248:02.17]That's so fucking funny.
[248:04.03]Oh, I gotta talk to him for a second.
[248:06.27]We just gotta talk for a second.
[248:11.35]Uh, hey!
[248:12.24]Hey there!
[248:12.62]Hello!
[248:12.96]Hey!
[248:13.20]Hey!
[248:13.40]Hey!
[248:13.64]Hey!
[248:13.88]Hey!
[248:36.97]A rake, a rake situation.
[248:39.60]A rake situa- What do you mean no deal?
[248:43.50]What do you mean no deal?
[248:44.36]Well, I don't even know what the deal was.
[248:45.34]I thought that's why you're messaging me.
[248:48.83]Okay, we got pinged.
[248:53.01]We got, you see the ping?
[248:54.13]We got pinged.
[249:00.68]It seems like we're both having a... I'm doing fine.
[249:03.44]I'm doing great.
[249:05.10]I'm actually so good.
[249:06.80]I heard that you were having a little bit of trouble, but to make it a little bit easier for you, because it's going very well for me.
[249:16.33]So I'm pretty close.
[249:17.84]I mean, on my side, everything is like, man, I couldn't be doing better.
[249:22.88]Yeah, so what was the idea for a for a some kind of a truce or something?
[249:28.69]I wasn't bad.
[249:29.13]I wasn't just my volume to talk to you while fighting him.
[249:36.33]So I heard that I heard down the grapevine that you want to be able to Google.
[249:41.54]That is no, I don't.
[249:42.90]I don't need to Google anything.
[249:45.78]I heard that you're totally lost.
[249:49.24]You have stream hoppers in there talking a bunch of crap.
[249:51.78]How's it going for you?
[249:53.16]What's the real deal?
[249:54.47]Tell me the truth.
[249:54.87]The real deal is I think I've got this soon.
[249:59.71]Is there a reason why I can't kill these fucking skeletons?
[250:02.17]I've hit them like 10 times on the ground.
[250:05.58]It knows that you're evil and evil characters can't kill skeletons.
[250:13.64]Why won't these die?
[250:16.39]Oh, it's the right, right, right, right.
[250:17.47]I forgot.
[250:17.77]I forgot.
[250:18.07]Okay.
[250:18.95]Alright.
[250:19.21]So on a scale of 1 to 10, how fucked up are you being right now?
[250:25.35]I'm not ready to like say that I'm getting fucked up.
[250:29.42]Okay.
[250:30.18]I think I'm hitting like a second wind.
[250:32.28]You're hitting a second wind right now?
[250:34.20]Yeah.
[250:34.54]That's funny you said that because I've right now am also hitting a second wind right this very second.
[250:43.74]I actually was moments away from farting into the lighter.
[250:48.81]I think, yeah, it's going to be, you know, you know what I mean?
[250:52.09]Okay, so there is no new rule.
[250:55.54]We're continuing.
[250:59.02]Okay, no deal.
[251:01.88]No deal.
[251:04.36]But if there were a deal.
[251:05.94]If there were a deal, you'd have to come up with whatever that deal is very quickly.
[251:10.60]If there was a deal, what weapon is like really good at fighting putrid knight specifically?
[251:18.51]Um.
[251:21.51]Anything fast?
[251:28.49]Pretty much anything fast, I would say.
[251:30.76]Yeah, but like let's say.
[251:36.26]What are we saying?
[251:42.63]How fast?
[251:44.23]How fast do I need to know?
[251:47.39]Um.
[251:50.46]Okay, I'm going to tell you, if we allow a Google, I'm going to win in 10 minutes.
[251:59.50]If I'm allowed to Google, I will win in 10 minutes if I'm allowed to Google.
[252:04.11]I will win in an hour if I don't switch weapons, so I'll take those odds.
[252:09.41]Dude, are you serious?
[252:13.91]Okay.
[252:15.82]Dude, why do I laugh like a fucking air horn now?
[252:19.04]What happened to me?
[252:20.66]Alright.
[252:21.98]No deal?
[252:24.88]I slammed the button down.
[252:25.74]No deal.
[252:26.76]No deal.
[252:27.28]Okay.
[252:27.66]Good luck.
[252:29.02]Good luck.
[252:31.14]This is going to suck.
[252:33.70]I may be at the plus three right now, but... Alright, how funny would it be if I were to go down there and kill a future knight right now?
[252:42.03]Because I definitely can with this weapon.
[252:45.29]I OK, what if you now hear me out?
[252:48.44]What if there's a scenario where I have everything I need and if he's still there?
[252:51.96]I go try to snipe future night.
[252:56.50]Would that be super BM?
[252:57.80]I think that would be huge BM.
[253:01.91]OK, let me pay attention because he could just lock it in and do it.
[253:06.61]OK.
[253:14.77]Is there an illusory wall in here?
[253:15.99]There probably is.
[253:16.53]I think I got everything in here.
[253:20.35]Did I pull, like, a lever or something?
[253:26.10]But... You should kill Putrid Knight with the nobles.
[253:39.39]Oh, that is diabolical.
[253:47.98]I, but I don't know, that could be, it's not a, it's not a great wall.
[253:51.69]Get me out of here.
[253:55.39]I'm into that, but I need to have a Grace right in front of a boss I guaranteed can kill in one try.
[254:02.47]So if he starts to actually do well, then I can, you know, like, fuck it.
[254:09.83]I can just run away.
[254:27.15]OK.
[254:27.23]This will get me to probably plus 3 or plus 4.
[254:30.84]Then I need a 5, 6, 7, which is probably like Lyndell, Altus, Consecrated Snowfields.
[254:37.48]Make sure I'm not running by any.
[254:38.52]It's the only reason why I'm fucking here.
[254:45.21]There's one.
[254:45.57]Alright, that's a plus three.
[254:47.83]I already have one of those.
[254:54.38]Nice.
[254:55.42]Hell yeah.
[254:57.08]Alright, I have plus four now.
[255:01.74]Now I need four, five, six.
[255:02.70]Alright.
[255:13.75]That's a big deal.
[255:15.17]I'm so glad I ended up coming down here.
[255:16.63]Okay.
[255:24.98]5, 6, 7.
[255:25.72]5, 6, 7.
[255:27.88]That's like mid-game.
[255:28.84]That's mid-game.
[255:29.84]That's Altus.
[255:37.03]I gotta find one in Altus or Gelmer somewhere.
[255:44.47]Dude, I got an illusory wall?
[255:45.47]Well, I can't steal it from him.
[255:46.39]He already... He already claimed it.
[255:51.35]Okay.
[255:54.49]Where is there a dungeon here?
[255:57.78]I'm just gonna just around this perimeter here.
[256:02.96]Just go around this perimeter.
[256:15.32]Yeah, Caelid as well.
[256:19.29]It's actually probably, you know, Caelid is definitely, although I have nothing uncovered in Caelid.
[256:27.41]But man, oh man, I just don't remember anything about Caelid.
[256:30.98]This is Smithing Stone's.
[256:34.10]I know there's like one here or here or here or even here or... I mean, is that a Smithing Stone one or is it just on the map to go find it?
[256:42.58]I don't know.
[256:43.12]I have no idea.
[256:44.87]I think I just have to go stumble around Kalid for a little bit.
[256:46.97]He's got time.
[256:47.83]He has a lot more time than he thinks he does.
[257:01.68]Here, I'm just going to go like this.
[257:04.34]We have to run here anyways.
[257:09.38]Do Redan's boss area.
[257:11.04]Yeah, but then I have to go kill Redan and I have to do all that bullshit.
[257:17.03]Killing Redan is just, it's not like, I mean, my character's leveled up, but I don't think I can do it.
[257:35.77]This has been fun though.
[257:38.33]This has actually been really fun.
[257:41.09]Redan would be pretty easy for your level.
[257:43.64]Yeah, let me just see if I can get in one of these.
[257:48.08]If I don't find one in the next five minutes, I'll go kill Redan and I'll go to that.
[257:52.22]I know where that one is.
[257:53.04]It's right in front of the boss.
[257:54.34]I guess it's just right there.
[258:00.56]We have a whole nother board that is completely unique.
[258:05.97]So there is another board that's unique.
[258:11.80]Alright, where are we going here?
[258:12.86]I would like a Grace here.
[258:19.57]That would be wonderful.
[258:37.88]Fuck.
[258:38.52]How do I get over there?
[258:39.16]Because I want to look- I want to go down here.
[258:48.37]Down here?
[258:50.25]Okay, yep, yep, yep, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I got it.
[258:53.05]I got to hug this whole wall.
[259:00.26]If I die, I'm going to be pissed.
[259:04.13]Okay, over here.
[259:06.17]No, that's where I started.
[259:07.29]Okay, I'm gonna hug this wall.
[259:18.22]So I need five, six, seven.
[259:21.68]And then I think I'm gonna go up to the consecrated snowfields.
[259:31.39]Oh fuck yeah.
[259:33.37]Thank goodness.
[259:46.70]Verdana's already dead.
[259:47.64]I don't really care about fighting anything.
[259:56.52]Also keep in mind that I still have to, they still have to kill a boss.
[260:01.87]Which, that might be harder than I'm anticipating.
[260:07.38]Think about that.
[260:10.10]Glovewort 4.
[260:14.86]Even a boss like Rinala still might be annoying.
[260:19.68]She might just kill them. ...
[260:33.87]And I already killed Godrick, so I can't do that.
[260:37.92]Level 3?
[260:39.04]Really?
[260:39.32]There's got to be a 5 in here.
[260:42.10]Okay.
[261:10.33]No more in here.
[261:22.81]What about down?
[261:23.71]There's a down.
[261:24.15]There's a down.
[261:24.53]There's a down.
[261:24.89]There's a down.
[261:25.25]There's a down.
[261:35.28]Hold on.
[261:40.89]I need five, five, six, seven.
[261:45.45]Oh shit, that's not good, but this is five.
[261:50.09]It's not five.
[261:56.53]What the hell?
[261:57.11]Oh.
[262:03.02]Ster is crying right now.
[262:06.16]I ain't even close, so don't worry.
[262:13.55]It wasn't even any fives down here.
[262:16.63]What about in the boss room?
[262:22.77]It probably is Lyndell.
[262:27.95]Any in the boss room?
[262:30.23]These things sucked.
[262:30.91]I remember these.
[262:41.35]Holy shit, that hurt.
[262:57.00]Jesus so
[263:30.95]Alright, turn around.
[263:31.53]He did it?
[263:34.07]No.
[263:34.63]Okay, this is the ashes.
[263:36.94]Okay, now I'm going to ride it up now rather than go down.
[263:44.40]Why are you playing the game?
[263:45.40]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[263:46.34]I just wanted to kill someone.
[263:52.90]Okay, it might have been a five up instead of going down the elevator.
[264:12.55]Like if I just instead of not going up the elevator, I'm just going to go this way.
[264:17.21]Did I already look over here?
[264:18.11]Did I get everything?
[264:20.54]Shit, it was only three and fours in here.
[264:25.20]There was three and four, that's it.
[264:35.94]Ster's turning into the Joker.
[264:47.21]Ugh!
[264:48.89]Five, six, seven.
[264:50.60]It's consecrated snow field, and Lyndell, or...
[264:55.70]I don't, I don't know.
[265:03.83]Kaleid is low level.
[265:05.37]It's... I was in Altus already and I turned around like an idiot.
[265:14.08]If only I knew where any of this shit was.
[265:21.19]What about Weeping Peninsula?
[265:22.35]No, not quite.
[265:24.89]5, 6, 7 is up here.
[265:32.07]This is a shack.
[265:36.92]Maybe here somewhere?
[265:39.00]Here?
[265:39.32]I think there might be one right here.
[265:42.94]I think that's accurate.
[265:49.80]Ster has cartoon steam going- coming out of his ears.
[266:01.08]Dude, I- you mean I- I'm not running through all the Haligtree Town?
[266:06.38]Aramazoola's over here though.
[266:15.69]I feel like there's one here or here.
[266:18.41]No, there's that one there, but that's the Smithing Stone dungeon.
[266:22.53]I'm just going to go look over here, like in this area, like under here and around here.
[266:28.13]Like here-ish.
[266:30.14]I got to go.
[266:30.84]Let's go.
[266:31.16]Go, go, go.
[266:31.70]Just go into the capital right now.
[266:32.86]Hurry up.
[266:33.18]Go, go.
[266:33.64]What are you doing?
[266:34.10]Stop.
[266:34.36]Go.
[266:41.38]This deer is losing his mind.
[266:45.57]I mean, he can come propose a-a new deal.
[266:47.71]Okay.
[267:03.88]I just have to- I just have to go.
[267:05.16]You just do it for the boys?
[267:20.72]If I can get 5-6, I'm pretty certain Consecrated Snowfield has 7-8.
[267:24.56]Just have to find 5-6 and I'm good.
[267:37.63]Ster is starting hate threads about me.
[267:42.35]Why?
[267:44.15]Mogless run?
[267:45.55]It is.
[267:54.96]Okay.
[267:57.12]Right there.
[267:59.50]That's going to be one.
[268:02.89]Right there.
[268:07.35]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[268:09.11]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[268:29.25]That's- do you fall through this?
[268:31.31]That wasn't just a shallow pool?
[268:32.63]Um... Um... Goodness.
[268:46.18]Um...
[268:58.27]That's a crystal dungeon.
[268:59.28]There's no glove ward in there.
[269:00.36]There's definitely one over here.
[269:04.35]I think we're both going crazy.
[269:17.29]why is right ester right now going like man I know where all the glove ward is I know where everything is it's so easy I know where all these dungeons are I played the game I know where California is I know where Idaho is he wants to swap so bad with me I told you he hates putrid knight he thinks it's the worst boss we talked a lot he was like man that boss was really hard for me like it sucked and I was like it was really difficult oh this he's he's probably not happy right now
[269:49.78]He's blasting music and turned off ray tracing.
[269:58.86]I need music too.
[269:59.56]I need like fucking heavy metal or something.
[270:00.93]Give me something good.
[270:01.57]We're coming out of the crunch time.
[270:02.51]He's going to beat it?
[270:03.51]No, he is not.
[270:04.51]I'm going to do this.
[270:05.03]I'm going to lock in.
[270:05.69]I need heavy metal.
[270:07.01]I need something that's like... That's not heavy metal.
[270:10.95]That's something completely different.
[270:12.57]I need something good.
[270:13.67]I need something heavy metal.
[270:14.71]Doom OST?
[270:26.68]Give me something good here.
[270:28.41]Alright.
[270:34.58]I'll go Doom.
[270:56.74]When the shadows first lengthened, one stood.
[271:04.32]He chose the path of perpetual torment.
[271:07.62]It's going to be fucking loud.
[271:09.52]Hold on.
[271:10.20]In his ravenous hatred, he found no peace.
[271:14.38]And with boiling blood, he scoured the Umbral Plains, seeking vengeance against the Dark Lords who had wronged him.
[271:39.61]Oh shit.
[271:40.65]Dad.
[271:41.99]Dad put on the Doom Slayer music.
[271:48.31]Dad, where are we going?
[271:49.97]I'm gonna find California if it doesn't fucking kill me first.
[272:03.27]Fuck the map!
[272:52.98]I don't need graces.
[273:58.66]Why?
[273:58.96]Where's my map?
[274:00.60]Okay, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[274:01.64]Right here, right here, right here.
[274:10.41]There has to be one over here, right?
[275:07.78]Don't touch that!
[275:22.79]Let's fucking go.
[275:24.41]I got it.
[275:24.91]I got it in the bag now.
[275:31.02]I need seven, eight.
[276:00.15]7-8, 7-8, 7-8, 7-8, 7-8, 7-8, 7-8, 7-8.
[276:01.25]What?
[276:01.83]Oh, sorry.
[276:07.17]Consecrated Snowfield is 7-8.
[276:08.91]Where am I going?
[276:09.49]What happened?
[276:10.57]No, we're good.
[276:10.89]That's fine.
[276:11.15]That's fine.
[276:11.45]Good, good, good, good.
[276:12.00]Who cares?
[276:12.32]Fuck it.
[276:12.70]I'm good.
[276:14.12]There's no glove ward here.
[276:17.84]I need 7-8.
[276:19.20]7-8 is going to be Consecrated Snowfield.
[276:21.40]A dungeon in Consecrated Snowfield.
[276:23.02]Let's go.
[276:24.09]Come on, man.
[276:24.97]Come on.
[276:27.74]Alright, get me out of here.
[276:28.48]Go out, out, out, out, out, out.
[276:29.64]Now, now, now, now.
[276:30.52]Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out.
[276:33.34]I still have to get to a boss.
[276:44.63]Why is this taking me so long to do this?
[276:48.53]What is happening?
[276:49.49]Just do it.
[276:51.49]That was the longest possible thing I could have done.
[277:06.24]Okay, there's a dungeon here, but that's a crystal cave.
[277:09.32]I need something.
[277:10.38]I need a dungeon up here.
[277:12.24]I need a dungeon in here.
[277:13.76]I need a dungeon.
[277:14.42]Maybe like... I don't fucking know, dude.
[277:16.64]We're just gonna run across there.
[277:41.50]Wait a minute.
[277:41.88]Wait a minute.
[277:42.24]Wait a minute.
[277:42.60]Wait a minute.
[277:42.92]Wait a minute.
[277:43.26]Wait a minute.
[277:43.56]Is that 7-8?
[277:44.02]Is that 8?
[277:44.55]That's 8-9, I think.
[277:46.33]I think that's 8-9 in there, guys.
[277:49.95]What the hell?
[277:50.35]What's going on?
[277:56.50]I can't see shit.
[278:08.11]How do I get down?
[278:27.16]I think that there's a bell bearing in there, but I think it's 8-9.
[278:31.21]I don't think it's 7-8.
[278:38.93]Oh my god, don't die.
[278:59.79]What the fuck is happening to my character right now?
[279:02.67]What the hell happened?
[279:11.90]That scared the shit out of me.
[279:28.45]I don't know what one this is.
[279:29.63]I don't know what one this is.
[279:33.46]I have to go for it.
[279:35.66]This is smithing stones.
[279:39.92]No, this ain't it.
[279:41.04]This ain't it.
[279:41.46]This ain't it.
[279:41.86]Go back up, up, up, up, up, up, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, up.
[279:44.76]Go back, go back, go back, go back.
[279:48.73]It's like up here.
[279:49.77]I gotta just run across this.
[279:51.01]There's gonna be one here somewhere, right?
[279:52.87]Or like here.
[279:54.77]I'm so fucking close.
[280:09.30]Now that I know where the wall is.
[280:14.69]Just go on the edge.
[280:16.63]That's the plan.
[280:25.07]Why is this so stressful?
[280:26.80]It's wicked stressful!
[280:27.88]Because I need only two more Glove Wars and then I have to get to like... I have to get to Rinala.
[280:35.28]That's not hard to do, but I have to beat Rinala and they have to kill Rinala.
[280:41.83]Okay, okay, I gotta pay attention.
[281:01.50]Oh, Ronaldo's already dead!
[281:02.72]Shit!
[281:04.26]I- Okay, I can- Redan.
[281:06.78]Oh my god, Redan's gonna kill the boys so easily.
[281:15.87]Redan's going to kill the boys in one hit.
[281:17.91]Redan is dead too.
[281:20.16]Morgott?
[281:21.26]It's Morgott.
[281:22.78]I got to kill Morgott with the boys.
[281:25.02]At plus 10.
[281:25.38]I don't know where the hell I'm going.
[281:28.86]Where am I going?
[281:29.26]Where am I?
[281:36.52]It's too smoky.
[281:43.02]It's way too smoky.
[282:01.02]Okay, where?
[282:01.86]Everything is too smoky.
[282:03.09]I can't see.
[282:09.91]Give me my map back.
[282:11.09]What is even aggroed to me?
[282:11.89]Nothing.
[282:12.25]There's nothing aggroed to me.
[282:16.67]There's nothing aggroed.
[282:18.15]Why?
[282:19.95]Cut this out.
[282:21.59]Oh my god.
[282:41.67]No, that's a nine.
[282:42.63]I don't need that.
[282:43.57]I need eight and seven.
[282:53.19]I need seven, eight.
[282:55.13]Ah!
[283:19.95]We're good.
[283:22.29]Thoughts on mushrooms on pizza?
[283:24.67]Mushrooms on pizza are alright.
[283:25.87]This is way louder for me than it is for you.
[283:28.25]Mushrooms on pizza are good.
[283:29.59]I think that, to a certain extent, they add a little bit of flavor.
[283:32.82]They're a little too gummy, though.
[283:34.34]Nah, get them off.
[283:35.18]Wait, isn't this the shit where you have to jump
[283:55.83]Damn it.
[284:00.28]I need an eight.
[284:01.16]I need a seven and an eight.
[284:02.30]And this is a done deal.
[284:05.16]And then I just got to run to Morgott or even Godfrey.
[284:07.60]I could kill.
[284:08.34]Well, no, that's not remembrance.
[284:09.42]That's right.
[284:16.21]What the fuck are you doing in here?
[284:17.91]Get out of the tunnel.
[284:18.87]You're blocking the entrance.
[284:20.81]Oh my God, dude.
[284:22.15]Give me a break.
[284:24.83]Get out of the way.
[284:30.79]Alright, you jump down where?
[284:32.29]Like right here, right here.
[284:33.06]Tempered by the fires of hell, his iron will remains steadfast through the passage that preys upon the weak.
[285:03.84]Wait, what?
[285:05.40]Where am I?
[285:06.91]Did I just get a... What?
[285:09.55]Did I fall past the statue of America?
[285:43.34]How do I get out of here?
[285:44.22]There.
[285:46.90]Okay.
[285:47.10]There it is.
[285:47.36]There it is.
[285:47.70]There.
[285:47.82]Good, good, good.
[285:48.20]I got it.
[285:48.46]I got it.
[285:48.66]I got it.
[285:48.84]I'm good.
[285:51.36]Okay.
[285:52.54]Get away from me.
[285:55.44]Please be seven or eight.
[285:58.22]Oh my god.
[285:59.08]This is bad.
[285:59.74]This is actually a disaster.
[286:01.56]This is a total disaster.
[286:02.54]This is a disaster.
[286:04.41]This is a disaster.
[286:21.16]Where else can I get a seven?
[286:23.58]There's an eight in here for sure.
[286:25.42]Let me get the eight.
[286:27.74]I'm gonna slow it down a little because the more you panic, the more it causes a problem.
[286:35.37]Let me just kill everything.
[286:36.39]I mean, Ster is probably... He probably took a smoke break.
[286:41.20]Ster probably started smoking cigarettes right now.
[286:44.10]You know what I mean?
[286:44.88]I think I'm alright.
[286:50.48]Okay, so where do I go from here?
[286:52.28]Isn't it just straight ahead?
[286:54.50]Oh, is it that way?
[287:08.39]I need to get the eight and then I can go to... I don't know.
[287:11.14]I need one seven.
[287:20.97]This is going to be so close.
[287:24.01]I have every single one I need besides seven after this dungeon.
[287:46.94]Get away from me.
[287:50.34]How are you still alive?
[287:53.62]Okay, okay, okay.
[287:54.48]There's none in here.
[288:04.78]What the fuck?
[288:07.08]Oh my god.
[288:13.35]I have to get the 8 that's in here.
[288:20.77]I have to pee so bad too.
[288:23.15]I have to- I'm gonna pee my pants.
[288:32.16]You need motivational music?
[288:36.44]I just need to- I- I- This is the invisible bridge place.
[288:59.09]Yeah, I don't have any rainbow stones.
[289:02.19]OK, so then from here I go this way.
[289:06.56]You go like that.
[289:07.50]There's a bunch of shitheads in here.
[289:12.54]OK, then.
[289:18.31]Oh my God, you little shit.
[289:24.11]Get out of my way.
[289:25.53]Actually mad.
[289:27.21]Alright, now what?
[289:30.59]It's not right there.
[289:33.41]Is it there?
[289:34.55]Like that way?
[289:35.79]No, it's like right there.
[289:36.99]I don't know.
[289:43.95]It looks like I can go over there.
[289:47.29]Line up with it.
[289:54.54]Bro, what the fuck?
[289:55.90]He's standing right there.
[289:57.32]Ster's gonna win.
[290:11.23]I got to get the fuck out of here.
[290:13.19]I got to get the fuck out of here.
[290:14.89]I got to get out of here.
[290:15.49]I have to get the fuck out of here.
[290:26.48]I can't even ride this.
[290:27.66]I don't have the grand lift of Dectus or whatever the hell the thing is.
[290:30.66]I can't even leave.
[290:31.48]I can't leave this area.
[290:38.27]Oh, thank God.
[290:39.72]But, but, but where's, but I need a seven and eight.
[290:44.28]Where do I get this?
[290:47.62]Up here and then this way?
[290:49.18]I don't think I can even get over here.
[290:50.26]I don't have the Grand Lift.
[290:52.87]I have to, I have to kill Morgott to get the Grand Lift.
[290:54.77]And Morgott was the guy I was going to kill with the... Go to the mountains?
[290:59.33]I, I can't.
[291:10.56]Okay.
[291:11.12]If I can just run.
[291:11.94]I don't know where- I know there are some down here.
[291:29.70]Are there- I swear to god there's like a few in here.
[291:34.26]Am I insane?
[291:37.97]I need a Glovewart 7 and 8.
[291:39.79]And it's going to drive me insane.
[291:44.02]Because I can't get over here.
[291:45.64]I got to turn the music off.
[291:47.18]It hurts my brain.
[291:50.82]Where the hell is a plus 8 Grave Glovewart?
[291:56.07]It has to be in the snowfield somewhere.
[291:58.93]Or late, late Lyndell.
[292:01.81]But there's nothing even in Lyndell.
[292:03.47]There's no dungeon in Lyndell.
[292:08.65]The 7 and 8's in the DLC.
[292:12.75]Yeah, but where?
[292:14.77]Like, was there a 7 and 8 down here, maybe?
[292:17.51]Because I got a couple of... I got an 8.
[292:21.27]No, I got a 9 and a 10 down here.
[292:26.59]What is underneath?
[292:27.41]What do we have underneath?
[292:34.86]Because this Ainsel River is down here.
[292:37.08]I have Ainsel River.
[292:38.10]I can maybe just run to here.
[292:40.48]I know there's a 1.
[292:41.26]I think there's a 9 here somewhere.
[292:44.10]I'm going to just run around here.
[292:50.86]The sewers too.
[292:51.90]Honestly, I don't even know how to get to the sewers.
[292:53.78]That's going to be a huge pain in the ass.
[292:55.34]I have no idea where the hell to go.
[292:57.52]Alright.
[292:57.90]Let me just try to get down here.
[293:01.61]Can we turn this back up?
[293:05.33]Nine minutes of ads, bro?
[293:06.79]What the hell are you talking about?
[293:07.89]I don't run ads.
[293:10.93]What crack are you smoking?
[293:16.99]There's also the scenario where you get the final bell.
[293:23.68]I don't remember if it's in
[293:28.06]You gotta kill the Godskin Duo.
[293:31.48]It's Godskin Duo.
[293:34.60]I would need to make sleep pots.
[293:36.48]I don't know where the hell I'm going.
[293:47.43]I gotta kill these things so I can look them up.
[293:55.69]Okay.
[293:58.90]I feel so bad for Ster Ster has probably been fighting putrid night for the last 45 straight minutes last hour.
[294:05.31]Alright, where I think this is correct.
[294:09.53]Just go this way and then to the left.
[294:12.11]Come on, come on, come on baby.
[294:25.08]That wasn't correct.
[294:34.14]Oh my god.
[294:36.00]Damn it, dude.
[294:37.02]I'm so fucked up right now.
[294:38.44]I don't even know how to get to the Lake of Rat from here.
[294:42.12]I have no idea how to go anywhere.
[294:50.51]You're missing three.
[294:51.31]Check your inventory.
[294:56.93]Two, so, okay.
[294:58.41]Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[295:04.47]No, I'm not missing.
[295:05.17]I just need seven and eight.
[295:08.01]Those are so specific, though.
[295:09.47]They're so late game, but not too late specific.
[295:14.72]What's the fastest way to get into the Lake of Rat?
[295:16.82]I think there's an eight in here.
[295:18.06]I think I just gotta go this way.
[295:28.21]I'm kicking my feet right now, because I'm just- everything's so- everything's going so wrong!
[295:32.86]Ster just took his pants off?
[295:36.86]Oh shit, are we gonna get a frenzy flame?
[295:41.66]I'm sorry, I'm sorry, that was fucked up.
[295:43.99]That was fu- Alright, lock in, lock in, lock in.
[295:49.13]I'm fine, I'm fine.
[295:50.39]Everybody can relax, everything's going just fine.
[296:01.59]Just make it through this.
[296:03.79]I haven't... guys... I haven't been to the Lake of Rat in three years.
[296:09.57]This game is hard.
[296:12.54]I don't know where anything is.
[296:23.74]Oh, fuck you.
[296:41.29]You gotta go to the mountaintops?
[296:42.77]Yeah, but I have to kill Morgott to get to the mountaintops.
[296:45.35]I don't have the- I don't have the lift.
[296:47.83]You need the grand lift of... rolled.
[296:51.07]You need the grand lift of fucking rolled gold pretzels.
[296:59.91]I don't have it.
[297:08.67]Okay, down here.
[297:09.41]Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.
[297:18.61]Okay.
[297:19.89]Now.
[297:22.62]Is there any over here?
[297:34.80]No.
[297:35.94]So I do have to go up and all the way around.
[297:43.35]Why are you throwing?
[297:45.35]I'm trying to get to the Lake of Rat.
[297:47.15]I know the Lake of Rat has at least a plus eight.
[297:50.39]I know it.
[297:51.29]I'm certain of it.
[297:51.93]I know it in my heart.
[297:57.36]Ster's voice is quivering.
[298:05.84]Where do I go from here?
[298:06.50]Okay, in here.
[298:09.84]Let's go.
[298:10.30]Got it.
[298:10.68]Got it.
[298:11.08]Good.
[298:11.70]Come on.
[298:21.41]Sir is crying.
[298:22.29]His hands are at his face and he's crying right now.
[298:26.69]Okay.
[298:28.16]Come on.
[298:30.52]Let's get one back here.
[298:34.95]Sometimes they put them back here.
[298:36.23]No.
[298:37.95]Sometimes they're right there.
[298:38.93]What is this Ghost Glove Ward 1 nonsense?
[298:50.60]Okay, where does this go?
[298:58.86]You're shitting me.
[299:17.67]I wish they could just... Oh my god, there's a million people here and I can't look at the map!
[299:22.61]I don't know if this is the right way!
[299:25.53]I don't know if that's the right way.
[299:26.83]There's 200 people coming after me.
[299:28.05]I don't think it's... I don't think it is.
[299:43.76]Give me that glove ward.
[299:44.62]Where the fuck is it?
[300:06.18]There's no glove ward here.
[300:13.94]Mountaintops are the only way.
[300:17.21]No, no way.
[300:18.01]I had to have put like one.
[300:21.13]I know there's one in here.
[300:25.27]Just kill more God, dude.
[300:26.27]You have to.
[300:26.73]Why do I hate?
[300:35.80]You're probably right.
[300:46.89]Shit.
[300:54.73]Oh, I don't know.
[300:55.45]I think Stuart's going to do it.
[300:56.41]It's just it's such a specific... There's like four in the whole game on the ground.
[301:00.44]I need to get to that fucking Lake of Rat.
[301:04.16]It's that way.
[301:04.68]That's the way I was going to go.
[301:15.78]Bear, Missoula, I... I run around the whole game.
[301:28.55]I feel bad for Ster, but at least Ster doesn't have to run around the entire video game of Elden Ring with literally just crossing my eyes looking for places to find a Glovewort.
[301:38.30]I don't even know how to get into the Lake of Rat.
[301:51.42]Oh my god, dude.
[301:56.29]There's one Grave Glovewart 7 on a cliff over here.
[301:59.99]There's four in the whole fucking game.
[302:01.75]Okay, I'm getting mad now.
[302:03.37]I can't even leave.
[302:16.06]Alright, I'm gonna- I gotta go kill Morgott.
[302:23.11]No, I don't.
[302:23.82]Seven, eight... Where are these fucking things?
[302:32.50]Ster almost just won.
[302:33.68]Ster's gonna win.
[302:34.90]I'm just telling you.
[302:35.76]Is he, he, okay.
[302:36.96]He can do the repetition and learn the boss.
[302:39.72]I'm like, where is a, where is a fucking dungeon in this 700 hour video game with a, with a plus eight glove award?
[302:54.44]Shit.
[302:57.98]Are there any in Faramazoola?
[303:03.73]The sewers might be the only option.
[303:06.93]I gotta remember how to get to the sewers.
[303:14.60]I can't buy them without the bell.
[303:18.94]Alright, the sewers of Lyndell.
[303:21.71]It's like next to the dragon's foot.
[303:26.33]But then where the f- Where are they down there?
[303:28.59]It's like deep, deep down there.
[303:30.65]It's such a maze down there.
[303:33.35]Oh, I think it's over.
[303:34.21]I think Ster is going to take it.
[303:38.32]It is an unbelievable maze in the sewer.
[303:44.42]There's like two dungeons down there and I don't... I have no idea how to even get down there.
[303:52.83]I don't think... I'm trying to think of where... It's the place where the lightning people are throwing shit at you.
[304:01.61]I just don't remember.
[304:04.54]Without having fucking Google open to look at every single thing to know.
[304:07.94]I think it's over there.
[304:09.30]Is it going to kill me if I do this?
[304:21.39]Yeah, I missed it.
[304:26.84]It's like down there, but I don't know.
[304:28.44]This is the only Grace I have.
[304:33.22]Fair in Missoula has the bell.
[304:34.18]I think the Fair in Missoula bell is for the regular smithing stones.
[304:43.83]Oh my god, this place is so confusing.
[304:45.25]I should have just went for Santerino.
[304:50.29]I should have went for Santerino.
[305:03.97]Because I have to go kind of backwards and then this is the... No, where am I going here?
[305:09.45]I don't think I can get down here from here.
[305:14.63]Unless can I... There's a guy right behind me.
[305:18.23]I'm dead.
[305:19.93]Holy shit.
[305:21.56]How am I still alive?
[305:25.02]Okay, hold on.
[305:27.02]Don't freak out yet.
[305:29.28]Where am I?
[305:43.58]Uh... Is it over here?
[305:49.35]Don't... Nobody heard anything.
[306:00.37]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[306:01.13]I think it's over here.
[306:02.86]There's a spot like... Fuck, I don't... But that's not the right sewer.
[306:09.88]I feel like I am so close right now, but I just don't know.
[306:12.06]I have no idea.
[306:14.48]There it is.
[306:14.78]There it is.
[306:15.06]There it is.
[306:15.34]There it is.
[306:15.60]I got it.
[306:15.84]I got it.
[306:16.04]I got it.
[306:16.22]Everyone calm down.
[306:17.08]Relax.
[306:18.49]It's not over yet.
[306:19.13]I thought this was going to be way longer.
[306:29.84]This is it?
[306:31.10]Okay.
[306:34.64]Alright.
[306:34.86]Shh.
[306:39.22]Use a rune arc?
[306:39.92]I don't know.
[306:40.40]I don't have anything.
[306:44.34]Just get down here.
[306:46.00]And then I need to just get the Grace and run in a direction and get to a dungeon.
[306:51.01]And then it's Morgott is my goal.
[307:01.68]Get away from me.
[307:02.26]Get away from me.
[307:02.74]Get away from me.
[307:03.30]Just give me a Grace.
[307:14.69]Okay, this is scary because the Grace is... Where is it?
[307:20.05]The Grace is like over there and I need to get it.
[307:22.96]Don't kill me.
[307:23.36]Please don't kill me.
[307:23.90]Please don't kill me.
[307:24.42]Please don't kill me.
[307:24.96]Please don't kill me.
[307:26.68]Please don't kill me.
[307:27.24]Please don't kill me.
[307:30.46]Okay, I'm good.
[307:31.16]I'm good.
[307:31.48]We're good.
[307:37.92]I just have to get to one of those dungeons.
[307:40.16]I know there's like two down here.
[307:43.91]Just gonna pick a direction.
[307:44.87]I feel like this is correct.
[307:58.15]I could be wrong.
[307:58.89]I don't know.
[308:02.73]Oh fuck.
[308:08.00]Oh my god.
[308:14.00]Oh, God.
[308:14.58]I don't, I don't know.
[308:34.14]Shadow Bolt!
[308:42.53]Is there anything even here?
[308:45.01]What the fuck is the point of this?
[308:50.89]This is just a shortcut.
[308:52.05]Okay.
[309:04.66]You can drop down here.
[309:05.50]Can I survive this?
[309:07.46]I don't know where to go.
[309:13.66]I don't know where to go from here.
[309:23.36]I need a seven and an eight.
[309:34.18]Let's make it happen.
[309:35.08]Bingo.
[309:35.48]Come on.
[309:35.92]Let's go.
[309:38.80]And then I'm just going to sprint to Morgott.
[309:44.44]This is intense.
[309:45.16]This is fun.
[309:51.43]Dude, no wonder the bingo brawlers do this shit.
[309:53.43]It's awesome.
[309:55.17]This is like intense.
[309:58.60]Come on, give me one.
[309:59.94]Where are they?
[310:09.85]Pick it up.
[310:10.71]Who cares about that?
[310:11.65]Okay.
[310:13.95]Come on, where are they?
[310:29.15]What the fuck is happening?
[310:31.07]What?
[310:35.31]What just happened?
[310:37.53]Why did I have to... Why did I go all the way... What the fuck is going on?
[310:45.24]You need to fucking lock in, man?
[310:46.38]I'm confused what just happened.
[310:57.13]Wait, what?
[310:57.77]What's going on?
[310:58.87]Wait.
[311:00.59]Wait, down?
[311:01.15]I have to go down the elevator?
[311:04.71]Why am I getting so confused right now?
[311:12.18]What?
[311:14.28]Wait, what's going on?
[311:15.64]I haven't done this dungeon in three years.
[311:22.37]Oh my goodness, what is happening?
[311:24.15]Okay, okay, um...
[311:28.83]I still see no Glove Ward, which is a big problem.
[311:33.01]This is a huge problem.
[311:48.32]Where's the- where is it?
[311:59.32]There ain't no Glovewort in this.
[312:01.60]Glovewort 6?
[312:10.67]Ghost Glovewort 6.
[312:11.73]Is it over?
[312:15.25]It's over.
[312:29.46]Well, congratulations.
[312:30.66]You did it.
[312:33.25]Turns out, trying to find... What do you mean it's not?
[312:36.33]Are you guys lying?
[312:36.99]Are they lying?
[312:38.47]I have to die to... Oh, yeah.
[312:42.13]But I did beat the boss.
[312:43.47]Okay, well, it turns out... Yeah, it turns out trying to find a ghost grave, glove board seven and eight.
[312:49.81]There's like four in the entire game.
[312:51.78]It's like it was the most painful experience of my whole life.
[312:54.62]Oh, I have two eights.
[312:55.80]Do you need them?
[312:57.04]Where did you even get them?
[312:58.90]Uh, I got him off two of the boats in the blue flower area.
[313:01.92]Grave Glove Ward 9.
[313:02.89]9?
[313:03.01]Dude, I have 8 and 9.
[313:06.61]Are you serious?
[313:07.27]I need 7 and 8.
[313:07.97]Okay.
[313:08.97]Okay, I have 8.
[313:10.37]I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10.
[313:17.04]Dude, running around the entire video game without anything uncovered, trying to find this shit is like, oh my god, what a horrible experience.
[313:25.11]There's, okay, there's eight right there.
[313:26.63]Hold on, I still got time.
[313:27.75]I have time to do this.
[313:28.85]Oh god, you're talking my fucking ear off.
[313:32.65]I need a seven.
[313:35.76]Is there a seven in here?
[313:39.94]He needs to die.
[313:41.00]Is that a seven?
[313:41.58]If this is a seven, I have a chance.
[313:45.92]Ugh.
[313:50.66]Well, then it's whoever wrote the comedy Drink the Nectar 10 times challenge.
[313:57.48]That takes like 10 minutes.
[314:00.64]I think you won.
[314:01.90]I think you won.
[314:02.84]I don't think there's any sevens in here.
[314:07.13]Where the fuck are there sevens?
[314:10.25]I swear to God, I looked everywhere.
[314:13.25]Grave Glovewort 7.
[314:19.66]They don't exist!
[314:30.72]Farum Azula has the Bell Bearing for 7, 8, 9.
[314:32.58]Is that... Is that... That's a Smithing Stone, isn't it?
[314:42.23]Damn it.
[314:43.75]Dang it.
[314:44.71]Alright, I'm looking up where is Grave Glovewart 7.
[314:47.43]Just like one on the ground.
[314:50.80]Uh, I thought we had an agreement.
[314:53.88]I'm guaranteed to lose.
[314:55.94]I don't think you are.
[314:56.82]I don't think you realize how long this takes.
[315:01.00]Okay, I won't.
[315:01.60]I won't.
[315:02.08]Well, I need a seven and who knows where the hell I can even find one.
[315:05.54]I think if you looked it up, you would do it in like twice, twice as fast as I can sniff her six more times.
[315:20.73]I think I'm throwing in the towel.
[315:24.09]Official?
[315:25.36]Yeah, it's just... I don't want to go look for a fucking dungeon in a random corner of the map somewhere.
[315:30.90]Because I... Okay, so the consecrated snowfield?
[315:37.43]That...
[315:40.14]That Grace... Getting over to the mountaintops, you need the thing, and I think they're all over here.
[315:47.73]Every grave Glovewart 7 is, like, in this brain hemisphere right here.
[315:52.05]I was saying, who decided to write this, get the Wandering Nobles to plus 10?
[315:58.71]I don't know.
[315:59.23]I figured it was, like... I was telling my cat how hard you fought for that to be a square.
[316:06.04]should have just been the wandering nobles get a last hit on on a DLC boss yeah well you know what it should have just been kill putrid knight well you got it get the lighter get the light I thought but I was telling me you were getting the lighter earlier I was thinking about it you're the Frenzied Flame character
[316:27.33]Volcano Manor cat it's just I when you're under okay when you're under that kind of pressure to go find the right catacombs to find the grave glove warts catacombs it's it's like you find the right I don't I don't know I don't know I haven't played this I don't I don't even I've played this game once no gg that's fun
[316:51.17]I had a good time.
[316:52.35]I think there was some pretty intense.
[316:53.61]That was pretty intense.
[316:55.27]That took longer than I thought, but it's because it took me an hour and like 30 minutes to beat Putrid Knight with a character.
[317:00.76]Alright.
[317:02.34]Well, just know.
[317:03.48]I killed one enemy like this whole run with the bow.
[317:07.66]What did you actually use to kill him?
[317:10.08]The scorpion dagger.
[317:15.59]Oh, okay.
[317:16.67]That makes sense.
[317:20.19]what was really happening Miyazaki needs to fix his game more like more like lag night you know what I mean you know what I mean dude yeah I honestly 2020 hindsight I should have just went to Santorino but never underestimate needing to know where things are
[317:49.86]that's like the the worst part of this was was like I don't know what any of that is and then it's like okay a good refresher I mean are you ready to do bingo too bingo too you mean like right now yeah do you need a nap uh let's take it let's take a few minutes do you know that I'm still not done sniffing her
[318:15.93]I'm still sniffing.
[318:18.25]Doing the same joke every single time.
[318:21.86]I don't necessarily think I want to do a 10 hour stream tonight though.
[318:27.84]Yeah.
[318:28.38]No, I don't.
[318:31.69]I didn't think this was going to take four hours.
[318:33.71]It really should have been an hour and a half shorter and then we'd be fine.
[318:40.33]It's a lot.
[318:40.99]It's a lot trying to figure out.
[318:42.29]That was fun though.
[318:43.04]That was awesome.
[318:44.86]This was the warm-up, man.
[318:49.22]I need to, like, eat food.
[318:51.64]Okay, so do you want to come back... Another day?
[318:55.64]Next, like, day or two.
[318:56.26]I think it would have to be Wednesday for me.
[319:00.27]I can do a Wednesday stream.
[319:01.25]Okay.
[319:03.75]Then do you want to...
[319:06.94]Let's prepare a... If it does go quick, I would want to have a third bingo ready.
[319:12.94]Just in case.
[319:13.41]Yeah, we'll... Like a different mix.
[319:15.05]We'll make another one.
[319:16.03]Or something else.
[319:16.93]Yeah.
[319:17.69]That was a lot of fun.
[319:18.77]I enjoyed that a lot.
[319:20.07]Me too.
[319:20.89]It was good.
[319:22.15]Did you even try to get through the laser zone?
[319:23.53]Or were you just... I'm just going right through.
[319:25.63]That was so hard.
[319:27.78]Dude, it was hard to get through without dying.
[319:30.64]Let alone...
[319:33.69]Try it sometime.
[319:34.45]You know what?
[319:34.89]Put it on the next bingo.
[319:37.64]I'm curious how many attempts it would really take one of us to get through no hit.
[319:44.04]I don't think I'd be able to do any.
[319:46.50]Some of these I don't think I'd ever be able to do.
[319:51.43]You killed Margit Blindfolded.
[319:54.89]I did.
[319:55.25]I actually don't even... That's pretty hype.
[319:56.79]Yeah, that's pretty hype.
[320:01.69]Alright, so see you Wednesday.
[320:02.99]Do it again.
[320:04.03]Yeah.
[320:08.11]Same time, same place, but also at a different time because it's Wednesday, which is technically not the same time, and the Earth has kept going.
[320:19.67]Spinning, spinning, just spinning.
[320:23.57]Damn it.
[320:24.01]If I only had a little bit more game knowledge, oh, I would have found a seven.
[320:27.66]It's okay.
[320:31.90]I know you really did.
[320:34.54]You really did.
[320:35.36]You have no idea how much time I had.
[320:37.98]But dude, even trying to find like a grave glove for four is like.
[320:42.78]But like where?
[320:46.34]Do you know how hard I was gaming?
[320:49.54]I know you.
[320:50.56]No, no, no.
[320:51.10]Do you know like you can tell you've been gaming hard when your your shorts you're wearing are more like a speedo.
[320:57.17]People I was hearing that you took your clothes off.
[320:59.61]I was like, I'll believe it.
[321:01.34]I was hearing that you were definitely farting into a lighter and screaming for the Frenzied Flame.
[321:07.74]I'm getting a lot of misinfo here.
[321:12.48]Oh, well, GG, dude.
[321:13.56]That was fun.
[321:14.94]GG.
[321:15.56]We'll see you Wednesday.
[321:17.08]Take care.
[321:17.76]And we'll go from there.
[321:22.28]Okay.
[321:23.88]We're not going to reveal what the other bingo board is because it's all different.
[321:27.62]So we don't want anyone to see it.
[321:31.98]So I'll say goodbye and say goodbye to.
[321:36.10]Bye bye.
[321:36.94]Oh, and also.
[321:41.96]Bye.
[321:42.76]Alright.
[321:45.28]Well, that was our first attempt at a Elden Ring bingo.
[321:50.53]Just saw it.
[321:54.13]I that actually was pretty intense.
[321:56.57]That was intense.
[321:57.49]A lot of complaining, but about where things are.
[322:06.17]But yeah, big shout out to StarZeroChris, Captain Domo, and obviously Lil Aggie.
[322:13.50]I watched on the couch them do this at Fast 50.
[322:18.76]And it was really cool.
[322:20.32]I was like, holy shit, that's really fun.
[322:22.64]And seems like an intense kind of battle.
[322:25.66]So big shout out, obviously, to the Bingo Brawlers.
[322:29.43]They do this a lot.
[322:31.11]This is something that they're going to be doing.
[322:32.89]So definitely follow those people.
[322:36.04]You absolutely should.
[322:39.78]And on Wednesday, I'll bring it up again.
[322:41.82]But yeah, I actually got some help from Chris specifically.
[322:44.42]Because I was just like, how do you guys even attempt to do that?
[322:55.37]What was my secret slime action?
[322:57.43]Mine was, Ster talks about PoE more than once.
[323:01.71]And apparently he didn't do it.
[323:06.08]And mine was... Encourage my friend.
[323:10.30]Okay.
[323:15.33]Encourage my friend.
[323:20.05]That's horse shit.
[323:24.15]But yeah, we'll do the next one on Wednesday.
[323:27.35]And maybe we can blow through two of them.
[323:32.46]I almost want to like watch back Ster stream and see just like how much he struggled during some of this.
[323:40.47]I, alright, but that's a, that's a good warmup though, because once I didn't do The Binding of Isaac thing in the middle, it was like die to bargain and I'll blindfold myself and then I'll kill the Furnace Golem.
[323:55.46]It's just, I was all over the place, but it was fun.
[324:04.61]What a way to end it too.
[324:08.15]You give Ster the really hard gamer thing.
[324:11.45]And Ster's a gamer.
[324:13.10]Really difficult.
[324:13.84]Like incredibly difficult challenge that he has to do.
[324:17.42]And that's going to be hard for him.
[324:19.78]And you give me the directions one.
[324:23.97]It was going to be very hard for me.
[324:27.08]I would have beat Putridite faster than I did that.
[324:30.46]And I 100% guarantee it.
[324:32.98]We both had a hard challenge at the end.
[324:36.38]Directions and gamer challenge.
[324:40.05]Oh boy, I was never going to win the direction one.
[324:46.69]Put the lighter in the middle next time.
[324:48.61]I will make sure to put the one in the middle.
[324:50.63]Something that... I can't believe my keyboard fucked up.
[324:57.65]Alright, I'll see you guys in a few days.
[324:59.37]Or what is it?
[324:59.73]Today's Monday?
[325:01.33]Yeah, two days, whatever.
[325:03.07]See you guys soon.
[325:03.63]Take care.
[325:04.03]Thanks for watching.
[325:06.36]Yeah.
[325:06.84]Oh, and the CDawg charity event was a lot of fun.
[325:09.56]If you didn't know, if you didn't see it, I was in it.
[325:13.98]I did some stuff.
[325:16.50]And I got a cool item.
[325:17.96]I got the Dark and Darker poster.
[325:21.33]CDawg is an amazing person.
[325:23.65]Really cool to see that pass over $500,000.
[325:24.93]Awesome, awesome, awesome.
[325:28.89]It was really funny because I was so adamant about... I don't know if you could hear me, but at one point during the stream when it was... Oh, one of the punishments is CDawg has to wear a diaper.
[325:37.90]And I was... I didn't write that one.
[325:40.48]That one was not me.
[325:41.88]I did the Freddy Fish one and a few others and working on some other stuff.
[325:46.36]Just like throwing spaghetti at the wall for that stream.
[325:50.12]But...
[325:51.59]I did not say, hey, man, there definitely should be a diaper in that.
[325:55.13]Yeah, definitely put Sue Dogg wear a diaper.
[325:58.21]And when I went on stage at one point, I took one of the balls because I was up there trying to get there because we had a little crane game up there.
[326:06.07]And I was doing the crane game and we got one of the balls eventually.
[326:09.42]I think Ludwig got it.
[326:10.74]And I started chanting, diaper, diaper, diaper.
[326:14.64]I think I chanted it a few times.
[326:16.34]I think it was Conor Eats Pants leaned over at one point.
[326:18.62]It was like,
[326:20.00]hey man um if you don't want people to think that you made the diaper one maybe you shouldn't chant uh diaper diaper diaper and I was like you know what that's uh that that's uh that's true that's absolutely true like maybe you shouldn't be chanting diaper diaper diaper if you want to tell prove to people you're not the one that did that are we not a good idea oh
[326:51.95]Yeah, the wizard.
[326:54.17]I was blessed by a wizard.
[327:01.21]That was a good Connor impression?
[327:02.48]Oh, was it?
[327:03.08]I was just kind of talking.
[327:15.05]Oh, wait a minute.
[327:18.43]My main YouTube channel...
[327:21.82]My, wait, my main YouTube channel is 40,000 subs away from a million subs?
[327:31.11]Really?
[327:33.07]The actual main, just, Jerma985 channel.
[327:37.00]How is that still, how is it possible that that's getting subs?
[327:40.42]I don't think that channel's even monetized.
[327:44.98]Dude, 40k subs to a million!
