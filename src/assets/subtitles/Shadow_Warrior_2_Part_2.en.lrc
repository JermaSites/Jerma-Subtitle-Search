[01:19.88]Hey, what is happening?
[01:27.86]Yeah, we're starting a little early.
[01:28.86]Well, not, I don't know.
[01:30.32]We'll see what happens.
[01:32.86]I want to try to get like at least like 30 to 40 minutes early.
[01:37.74]Considering obviously the fact that we're still dealing with problems with the internet.
[01:43.78]That wonderful thing called data traveling between computer to computer.
[01:53.12]Let me in.
[01:54.19]It's me, Data.
[01:56.23]Sorry.
[01:57.11]I can't let you in, Data.
[01:58.31]Not right now.
[02:04.51]That's kind of what's been happening.
[02:07.83]This stream is going to crash.
[02:09.83]I'm going to make a very formal announcement when most people are here.
[02:15.58]Don't worry.
[02:16.46]The stream is going to go down.
[02:17.46]Absolutely.
[02:18.40]Absolutely.
[02:20.65]I'm surprised you still have a voice after yelling on the phone.
[02:24.21]Oh, man.
[02:25.91]I was red in the face.
[02:28.47]You know when you're really mad at something?
[02:31.13]I'm going to wait until I tell this story because it's a very existential, internal-looking story.
[02:40.54]Everyone does this, but I'll wait for more people to show up.
[02:48.04]But I'm going to grab a drink.
[02:48.98]I'll be right back.
[02:50.39]And then we can get started.
[04:47.18]Alright.
[04:48.84]Let me get a hold of... What's Star doing?
[04:51.00]Does he want to play this?
[05:00.45]Log into Battle.net and just send him a message, see what he's doing.
[05:09.03]Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[05:30.45]In the meantime, let's get out of that.
[05:44.10]I guess I can just put the game on the screen.
[05:45.62]There it is.
[05:46.48]I don't know.
[05:48.14]I think Twitch Alerts is messed up.
[05:49.50]I haven't seen.
[05:50.98]Somebody just subscribed and I didn't see it.
[05:52.56]Yeah, my Twitch Alerts keeps reloading itself.
[06:00.22]That's weird.
[06:04.82]Well, whatever.
[06:05.44]I just saw that Walmart customer service is subscribed.
[06:08.40]I hope Walmart's customer service is better than Comcast's.
[06:15.19]Because Comcast really ain't so good.
[06:21.29]Already 12%.
[06:21.61]Holy shit, yeah, it really is already 12%.
[06:28.23]How long is this game?
[06:28.97]Is this like a six-hour campaign?
[06:37.64]Who knows?
[06:38.00]I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
[06:42.80]We're just gonna chill.
[06:43.46]We're waiting for Star.
[06:45.10]I think he's finishing up a competitive Overwatch game.
[06:54.37]Yeah, resubs aren't coming through.
[06:58.58]Twitch alert seems to be screwed up, but I just saw Skippy squeeze.
[07:02.41]Skippy squeeze in the chat.
[07:04.41]Thanks for four months, dude.
[07:13.03]Why are resubs?
[07:17.71]Resubs are not showing up, but new subs are, apparently.
[07:24.45]I don't know.
[07:27.30]Comcast.
[07:28.51]Eat it up.
[07:37.29]Well, I was assured that... Alright, I was on the phone.
[07:42.68]Let's go over the story real quick.
[07:45.02]So the second that I hung up, I say hang up, you can't really hang up a stream, you stop streaming.
[07:52.23]Stopped streaming, I grabbed my phone, and like, I couldn't dial the Comcast customer service number fast enough.
[08:00.03]I screwed it up like four times.
[08:01.79]It was like, 1-800-I-8-3, shit!
[08:03.07]Go, dilly dilly dilly, 1-800-3, goddammit!
[08:09.60]I fucked it up like three times.
[08:10.64]I was so mad.
[08:12.67]Jerma!
[08:13.60]Jerma!
[08:13.86]It was seriously like I was infuriated.
[08:15.94]Jerma!
[08:16.88]Jerma!
[08:17.68]You're talking about a red face.
[08:18.84]Jerma!
[08:19.38]Bright red.
[08:20.70]Jerma!
[08:21.30]Hold on.
[08:21.64]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:22.38]I'm telling a story.
[08:23.66]What's up?
[08:25.10]I was telling the Comcast red face story.
[08:28.34]Oh, what's up?
[08:29.43]Hey.
[08:29.95]How are you?
[08:30.37]Jerma.
[08:30.89]What's up?
[08:32.67]How are things?
[08:34.19]Good.
[08:34.74]Things are pretty good.
[08:35.80]Things are good?
[08:36.24]That's good.
[08:38.40]I got in the laundry machine.
[08:40.38]You got in the laundry machine?
[08:42.02]You told me to.
[08:44.36]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[08:45.76]Well, the dryer.
[08:46.44]You gotta, like, tumble around a little and get some nice hot air blowing on you.
[08:49.72]Do you want to hear a funny internet dying story from me to maybe cheer you up a little bit?
[08:54.75]Sure.
[08:55.63]The other night, it was pretty funny.
[08:57.11]I was playing through Doom again on the Nightmare difficulty.
[09:00.43]I wanted to go to bed.
[09:01.37]It was getting late, but I was so close to the final boss.
[09:04.15]So I kept playing, and I stuck through it.
[09:05.96]It was like 1 a.m.
[09:07.60]I get to the final boss.
[09:08.56]It does the jump down and roar, like, it's time to fight.
[09:11.36]My internet cut out.
[09:13.80]I'm never going to beat it on Nightmare mode now because my internet was out for like 30 minutes.
[09:19.20]Is Twitch alerts broken for you?
[09:21.66]It's acting very weird today.
[09:23.07]Yeah, because I don't... It keeps refreshing, like, follows and weird stuff.
[09:27.09]Yeah, I can't see anything anyone's doing.
[09:28.57]So, sorry, guys.
[09:29.61]If you're, like, subscribing or whatever, I can't see it.
[09:32.75]Thank you, though.
[09:37.15]Anyways, yeah.
[09:38.89]I'm going to mute and tell the rest of my red face story, if you don't mind.
[09:42.66]Okay.
[09:44.00]Okay.
[09:44.44]I'm in the game.
[09:45.22]I'm just kind of hanging out.
[09:46.44]So, get prepared.
[09:50.48]Alright, so anyways, I was on the phone.
[09:53.72]I called up Comcast, screwed it up three times.
[09:56.30]Just like, I can't even fucking do the number right.
[09:59.61]Like, got somebody on the line.
[10:01.07]Immediately, somebody.
[10:01.91]The thing with Comcast business, they answer fucking immediately.
[10:06.63]You get, it's not like wait on hold for like 20 minutes.
[10:09.41]Somebody talks to you within like 30 seconds of you calling that number.
[10:13.13]So I was, you know how most people have a bathroom?
[10:17.54]And inside the bathroom, I have like a huge mirror.
[10:20.50]You guys all have like big mirrors, right, in your bathrooms?
[10:23.60]Because you want to make sure you don't look like fat that day.
[10:25.96]It goes all the way down to your waist.
[10:27.96]Well, I was, like, naked.
[10:29.47]And I had, like, blotches all over my chest.
[10:32.51]My face was wicked red.
[10:34.10]I had, like, these... I was, like, breaking out in hives.
[10:37.94]So, not only did I strip naked before I called this person, I was bright red.
[10:42.64]And, like, I'm sitting there and she's going through the, like, script, you know?
[10:46.92]Like, hi, hello there, valued Comcast customer.
[10:49.82]How can I help you today?
[10:51.00]How are you?
[10:51.54]How you doing?
[10:52.67]And I was just like, you know, I'm okay, thanks for asking.
[10:57.57]I was just waiting for my opportunity.
[10:59.77]And she's like, oh, well, what seems to be the problem?
[11:03.20]You know it you know when you get really mad when you're fucking furious.
[11:06.22]It's so hard to talk It's so hard to like it's so hard to even make any words come out of your mouth you sit there And you're like yeah, and I just want to say I'm just not I'm really not that happy right now and I couldn't even figure out what I was gonna say cuz I was so mad and She's just like oh well hold on let's let's let's think so let's talk about this for a second What what is going on here?
[11:27.32]What's what is the problem?
[11:29.25]Upload speed at 9 p.m.
[11:32.01]Goes down it drops it just drops, and I'm really unsatisfied like I couldn't be I was like a child And eventually like I calmed down a little like the splotches on my chest got went away But I have so much trouble when I get really mad to like express myself especially like when I'm off camera like obviously when you like I'm on camera right like Fucking guy Comcast you suck.
[11:55.37]Oh, I'm so mad right now that camera turns off and
[11:58.93]And I'm just like, motherfucker, fucking, who do I have to strangle?
[12:03.90]I get so mad at shit like that, dude.
[12:06.16]Like, who am I going to fucking scream at?
[12:08.52]Who am I going to scream at?
[12:10.14]And then I grab like a fucking two liter bottle of coke and I just start slamming it.
[12:14.19]Give me the sugar, give me the fucking, give it to me.
[12:18.11]You know, it's like, oh, I get so, this has been driving me crazy.
[12:23.09]If I could, I can't even tell you how fucking mad this is making me.
[12:28.67]I get those red splotches when I ask.
[12:33.02]Oh, that one came through.
[12:33.94]Well, thanks, Coltergeist.
[12:38.54]Boston Hulk.
[12:42.64]But I feel so bad sometimes, man.
[12:45.38]Look, when you call up Comcast...
[12:48.29]That person... That person's just doing their job.
[12:52.33]They're like a support person.
[12:53.83]That's not... That person's not responsible.
[12:56.21]They're not like... That's not their job to make your internet work.
[13:00.74]They have to listen to the crazy people like me call and scream.
[13:04.22]So I try to like... I don't like to get mad at like customer support agents because they... It's not their fault.
[13:10.50]They didn't do this to you.
[13:12.86]The fucking shitty infrastructure did.
[13:16.89]So I try to be like, yeah, okay, alright, and I become very civil.
[13:23.90]But, yeah.
[13:26.98]With that being said, they are coming to fix the node in my neighborhood.
[13:32.85]I have no fucking idea what that means.
[13:35.59]I just know that there's like, I've heard that terminology before, that sometimes your neighborhood or street node or hub can be messed up and somebody has to fix it.
[13:47.49]That story was really boring.
[13:50.73]Why?
[13:50.91]I told you... Why are you listening to my story?
[13:53.16]Because I'm not doing anything.
[13:54.86]I'm waiting for you.
[13:56.88]You're fucking pretty boring.
[13:58.02]How does that sound?
[13:59.32]I am.
[13:59.66]I'm extraordinarily boring.
[14:01.20]You're pretty boring every day.
[14:02.56]I am.
[14:03.50]I streamed for probably two hours today, and I probably said like three sentences.
[14:09.19]That sounds fun.
[14:11.31]No, it wasn't.
[14:11.87]It was awful for everyone involved.
[14:16.74]I'm gonna say all-time top five, like, worst streams.
[14:22.68]What?
[14:23.50]Why?
[14:23.86]I aim for a new one every day.
[14:26.64]Tomorrow will be top five again.
[14:30.09]Alright, well, are you ready to play this video game?
[14:33.51]Uh, yeah.
[14:34.19]If you invite me.
[14:34.75]Okay, let me invite you.
[14:43.23]invite only.
[14:44.16]I think I have to be in the game, right?
[14:47.10]I believe.
[14:50.30]But long story short, I have no idea if they're going to fix it or not.
[14:55.22]I was told that somebody was coming to the node in the neighborhood today or Monday.
[15:00.31]So we're absolutely going to crash.
[15:01.87]The stream's going to go down abso-fucking-lutely in the next two hours.
[15:04.59]Absolutely.
[15:04.97]I just don't know when.
[15:09.43]Have you ever thought about
[15:13.78]Um, taking me up on my offer?
[15:17.36]Coming to stream at your house?
[15:19.02]Yeah.
[15:21.70]I mean, I could.
[15:22.84]If you have an important stream... How far are you in sorcery?
[15:25.56]Do you beat sorcery?
[15:27.99]My plans got all screwed up because of this whole thing.
[15:33.15]Sorcery was supposed to be done by now.
[15:35.99]It just spawned me in front of a raptor.
[15:39.85]What the fuck is this?
[15:41.97]Why am I not in a town?
[15:45.84]Why have I spawned right here?
[15:47.28]Probably because that's where you disconnected and it just resumed you.
[15:50.50]Oh, that's probably what it is.
[15:53.56]Can I get an evite?
[15:56.27]Hold on a second.
[15:57.35]I'm gonna have to... I got like... I got a naga fighting me.
[16:02.31]I have like the headcrabs fighting me.
[16:03.71]You're gonna have to wait a second.
[16:05.79]Press escape and it will pause the game.
[16:08.09]Oh my god.
[16:09.81]Oh, I didn't know... You liar!
[16:12.28]You're a liar!
[16:14.81]You fucking liar!
[16:16.86]I don't know, I'm guessing.
[16:18.06]Do you fucking... I just died!
[16:19.56]I pause the game and I hear like, ah!
[16:25.00]Ah!
[16:26.08]Ah!
[16:26.86]Star one, Jerma zero.
[16:28.99]Wow, that's bullshit.
[16:34.33]You know what?
[16:35.35]Can I have like a... Okay.
[16:36.61]It doesn't pause the game.
[16:37.59]Friends list.
[16:40.58]Why doesn't it just show who's online?
[16:44.33]Wait.
[16:47.09]Okay, they were just stupid.
[16:47.95]They were just idiots for that second.
[16:49.09]They're just idiots.
[16:50.21]They're just dummies.
[16:55.21]Um... Get pranked.
[16:56.07]Um...
[17:09.28]Hey, okay.
[17:10.75]This thing can't even smell me.
[17:12.63]Did someone say sleepover?
[17:13.99]Come sleep over.
[17:15.43]Let's have a sleepover.
[17:22.01]Sleepover.
[17:24.09]Just two friends and a sleepover party.
[17:25.53]Oh, you know what we have downstairs?
[17:26.81]Ashley wanted me to tell you.
[17:28.05]What?
[17:28.39]We have that, like, that media room they built down there.
[17:30.85]It's, like, done.
[17:31.65]It has a pool table.
[17:32.59]Really?
[17:33.41]It has, you know, a whole bar and everything, but it has a Pac-Man arcade machine in the corner for no fucking reason.
[17:38.77]Alright, well, you got me a Pac-Man.
[17:40.71]I didn't care about anything else you said, so yes.
[17:45.37]Let's fight this raptor.
[17:46.55]Dude, this is on two-player difficulty right now.
[17:48.55]Where are you?
[17:50.88]I'm hitting it.
[17:53.28]What the fuck?
[17:59.20]Okay, you know when people in any game with a console, they can do kill in the console?
[18:05.24]He just did that.
[18:07.44]That fucking headcrab raptor enemy just did slash kill in the console.
[18:11.98]Did you even see what happened to me?
[18:13.20]Or can you not see me again?
[18:18.66]I can't see you.
[18:20.99]I'm not near you now.
[18:22.73]Where did you go?
[18:23.31]I'm near you.
[18:26.49]I'm behind you.
[18:28.41]Right next to you now.
[18:29.39]Can you not see me?
[18:30.04]Oh, no.
[18:30.22]I can't see you.
[18:30.92]Is it already going to happen?
[18:31.92]Is it already happening?
[18:34.42]I don't know.
[18:34.86]No way.
[18:35.32]It's too early for my internet to go down.
[18:37.20]Hey, can we do a hold T and teleport back to town or something?
[18:41.20]I think we can.
[18:42.61]I didn't see if it fixes itself.
[18:47.61]I mean, my frames aren't dropping, so...
[18:51.67]Can you see me moving around and doing stuff?
[18:53.43]Yes, I'm following you around right behind you.
[18:55.23]What the fuck is going on here?
[18:56.51]Can we teleport to town?
[18:58.41]Yeah, just hold T. Yes.
[19:07.05]Hopefully you show up here.
[19:08.71]I'm already here.
[19:10.01]Oh, God.
[19:15.35]Well...
[19:16.84]That's interesting.
[19:18.36]So, Jerma, how about that, like, top five worst streams?
[19:22.08]I see you're in the top left.
[19:25.92]You're, like, in the game, but I just can't see you in, like... Hey, you're a ghost.
[19:32.91]Keep hitting shit.
[19:33.67]Come in here.
[19:34.49]Come in the Wank Cave and just stop breaking shit.
[19:38.07]Go break the drum set.
[19:40.25]Oh, look at this ghost!
[19:41.57]You're a fucking specter!
[19:45.51]Alright, I'm gonna have to find you.
[19:46.97]I have to find you.
[19:47.65]I have to follow you around and find you.
[19:53.17]This is like scary.
[19:55.31]It is like a haunted house.
[19:59.48]Oh, watch out for the stools.
[20:02.40]That's so scary.
[20:03.96]Apparently those swords have ammo.
[20:12.87]Oh no, what ghost is gonna show up down these stairs?
[20:17.48]This is so dumb.
[20:19.84]This is so funny.
[20:24.78]Okay, well, uh... Should you just invite me?
[20:30.32]We could try that.
[20:32.20]I don't... Let's try that.
[20:35.31]Give me the walkthrough.
[20:37.02]Just in the friends list menu.
[20:40.06]Yeah.
[20:40.24]Just go to my name and invite me.
[20:41.88]I'm just going to leave.
[20:42.83]I have to resume here.
[20:45.55]Yeah, just go into the game and do multiplayer.
[20:48.09]Check the box that says invite only.
[20:50.39]And then invite me.
[20:54.54]Alright, now I can see subscriptions.
[20:55.70]That was weird.
[20:56.14]So, Pren, thanks for three months.
[20:57.94]Wait, what?
[20:59.32]Fucking...
[21:01.33]Thank you, Sly161 for seven months.
[21:03.41]Thank you, BurntPieWizard, Luigi888994, Coultergeist, EpicMemes, and RickBilly.
[21:09.72]RickBilly, hi.
[21:11.84]I have an issue.
[21:12.74]What's your issue?
[21:14.68]I accidentally deleted my save file yesterday.
[21:17.04]What?
[21:17.36]And I have to do a tutorial before I can invite you.
[21:20.27]Well, then just hold the lemon.
[21:21.96]I'm speedrunning it.
[21:22.92]You talk to your stream.
[21:24.32]I'm going to do the speedrun of this tutorial.
[21:26.74]Why did you delete your save file?
[21:28.50]It was an accident, dude.
[21:30.07]Worst stream.
[21:30.95]Top five worst streams.
[21:32.53]Okay, I'm going to try right now to find how to delete this.
[21:35.61]I don't think I could if I tried.
[21:37.77]I accidentally clicked new game and it overwritten my last one.
[21:40.87]It was a lot of mistakes.
[21:42.79]Do you understand that I'm just, like, not good at streaming?
[21:45.87]Like, I'm not an entertaining or, like, good streamer.
[21:48.91]Uh-huh.
[21:52.91]Yeah.
[21:53.99]Yeah.
[21:54.61]And?
[21:55.91]Like, that's what happened.
[21:59.71]And?
[21:59.91]Dude, if I invite you to this game, we're going to have to do the Neon mission again.
[22:03.45]No, no.
[22:04.37]Because I haven't done that yet.
[22:05.81]I'm just going to invite you again.
[22:09.22]I'm not gonna sit around for the Neon mission to go through.
[22:12.18]I have to comfort him?
[22:22.07]Game sucks.
[22:24.75]It does not!
[22:25.83]It does not suck!
[22:28.13]This game's like fun.
[22:29.33]I'm an idiot.
[22:30.45]You're not giving it a chance.
[22:31.63]It's the game's fault.
[22:35.15]We haven't given this game the chance it deserves.
[22:41.10]My character is actually still level 5 from playing with you.
[22:44.02]I have the shotgun.
[22:44.86]I have all this stuff I have all the things from completing this tutorial But I technically don't have any like a character that's done the tutorial.
[22:52.37]That's okay.
[22:52.99]Well, just I'm gonna invite you that's I guess there's some weird bug in the game with It can just like remove you kind of invisible
[23:07.17]Is there people telling you that?
[23:09.17]No, I'm just assuming that because this is the second time it's happened.
[23:13.32]I'm assuming it's going to happen again.
[23:15.08]Well, then we'll have to deal with it.
[23:17.06]Because I don't want to sit around while you do the tutorial again.
[23:20.48]I'm like almost done with it.
[23:21.86]Yeah, but you have to do like the first mission too.
[23:25.88]You want to do that first mission again?
[23:28.92]I won't take that long either if we skip everything.
[23:31.88]Yeah, but it's probably going to happen to you too.
[23:38.05]I gotta hear him sing again.
[23:41.15]You gotta hear him say all those swear words again.
[23:42.83]Do you want that?
[23:44.07]I'm skipping.
[23:47.75]It's teaching... I missed all this tutorial before.
[23:50.09]Like, I have to do this, Jerm.
[23:51.18]I don't know how to play this.
[23:53.38]Can I, like, steal money from his register?
[23:56.20]Why are they all in weird places?
[23:57.86]Why is this guy over here?
[24:05.96]Alright, well, then, we're gonna chill...
[24:10.58]Play sorcery until he's done.
[24:12.20]He's going to be done very quickly.
[24:21.65]Well, I'm just going to go kill stuff then.
[24:24.45]No, you can't do it without me.
[24:26.33]You're going to invite me to your game.
[24:30.27]Am I though?
[24:32.97]What is happening right now?
[24:38.30]You can just come to this game right now, but you don't want to do that because you're afraid it'll happen again.
[24:41.62]But then I'm going to be invisible.
[24:43.20]Okay, but my point that I'm trying to make to you, I'm trying to make it real clear now, I'm going to be joining your game if you invite me, so it doesn't matter what I do over here.
[24:52.83]You understand?
[24:55.09]I actually completely understand.
[24:57.17]Okay, good.
[24:58.05]I just want to finish the tutorial, so I have...
[25:01.91]I'm like right at the end of it.
[25:03.75]Just let me do it.
[25:05.29]Just let me do it.
[25:06.17]I'm telling you, I'm going to join your game and it's going to happen.
[25:08.01]Like I'm going to be invisible for you.
[25:09.77]At some point.
[25:11.75]No.
[25:12.37]My internet works.
[25:14.44]I don't even have to pay like $130.
[25:15.50]But I don't think that's what's doing it.
[25:20.86]My internet's working fine right now.
[25:22.16]I cheated and got a skill point for completing the tutorial again.
[25:28.76]Okay.
[25:29.18]You're going to invite me?
[25:30.30]I'm done.
[25:34.26]So you're coming over here?
[25:35.68]Yeah.
[25:38.26]Okay.
[25:38.42]Because otherwise we're going to have to do the first two missions again.
[25:42.38]I already invited you.
[25:44.55]I already invited you.
[25:52.53]Something happened with you.
[25:53.35]I don't know what it was.
[25:53.97]Something changed with you.
[25:55.76]You used to be so much more fun, now you're just, like, cynical and mean and... Is everything alright?
[26:04.51]No.
[26:07.84]Hey, you know, you can talk to me, you know.
[26:10.22]On camera, in front of, like, you know, thousands of people.
[26:16.26]None of them like me.
[26:17.33]Did you get that?
[26:21.12]What?
[26:21.36]No, I'm barely paying attention.
[26:22.83]Can you see me?
[26:23.67]I can see you.
[26:24.85]Oh my goodness.
[26:25.61]Let's go graveyard.
[26:26.53]Let's teleport to the nether.
[26:28.47]Are you just telling me that to be nice?
[26:30.45]What?
[26:31.39]That you can see me?
[26:32.69]I can absolutely see you.
[26:34.31]You just did a jump.
[26:35.07]You're spinning around.
[26:35.91]How would I be following you right now with my eyes?
[26:37.45]How many fingers?
[26:38.28]How many fingers?
[26:39.18]One.
[26:39.66]One big finger that shoots the shotgun.
[26:43.42]Alright, so do we... was it M or was it I?
[26:47.22]I don't know.
[26:47.68]Yeah, alright, continue.
[26:50.92]Go to your... hit I, go to missions, click on the one that we were just doing.
[26:54.00]It's gonna teleport you right into like a naked guy.
[26:56.34]That means... that's how you know you're there.
[26:57.80]Wait, what?
[27:00.56]There's no naked guys on missions.
[27:02.90]I don't even have a mission.
[27:03.92]There are plenty of naked guys.
[27:05.00]Can you just teleport to me?
[27:06.20]I don't know.
[27:14.72]Apparently.
[27:15.22]Yeah, you are.
[27:20.40]Why did I spawn here?
[27:21.50]Well, do we have any grenades?
[27:25.51]I bet you that's like an upgrade.
[27:29.91]Therma.
[27:33.61]Too many people on the roof.
[27:34.67]Too many people on the roof.
[27:38.46]I thought we killed these already.
[27:40.72]We didn't.
[27:41.12]We had to teleport away.
[27:43.22]We had to come back.
[27:43.80]They respawned.
[27:44.66]I think it's procedurally generated.
[27:46.76]You know that word.
[27:49.87]It's perspirating generation.
[27:53.73]I think you're right.
[27:54.29]I gotta use my chakra.
[28:00.40]Nice.
[28:00.66]He's frozen.
[28:01.18]Hold on.
[28:02.38]I'm using my chakra.
[28:12.52]there oh he exploded cool cool cool epic epic epic we have to collect stuff unrefined uh black rain okay whatever that means okay I know we need to get it okay alright so look at the map let's collect some stuff okay
[28:44.00]Okay.
[28:44.48]Okay.
[28:45.74]Okay.
[28:46.30]Okay.
[28:47.42]Okay.
[28:48.64]Okay.
[28:49.24]Open this box.
[28:49.98]Okay.
[28:52.84]Okay.
[28:53.64]You are like a man of few words today, huh?
[28:57.14]Okay.
[28:57.50]I had a bad day.
[29:00.70]It's all Ashley's fault.
[29:01.80]I had a bad day.
[29:03.54]You found it downstairs.
[29:05.40]When you woke up and you turned it around because you had a bad day.
[29:14.05]Oh, you had a bad day.
[29:20.80]You should be a pop superstar.
[29:23.20]Really?
[29:23.52]You think so?
[29:23.94]Do I have a chance?
[29:26.52]This is not where we're going.
[29:27.95]Well, I see the key.
[29:28.79]There's like a key somewhere in here.
[29:29.89]What does that key mean?
[29:30.99]Oh, there it is.
[29:32.59]Key to the gate.
[29:33.13]What?
[29:34.21]Dude.
[29:51.60]Ooh, shotgun.
[29:53.28]I don't like the skip.
[29:56.13]Alright, fine.
[29:58.25]We can skip it separately.
[29:59.97]I'm just saying, I'm sick of it.
[30:01.37]I just want it to be known that I'm going to be the complainer.
[30:04.18]If you guys want to go to the non-complain stream, go watch
[30:09.09]Go watch me because they can hear you.
[30:12.51]It's gonna be the complain stream on both streams because you are on both of them.
[30:15.95]I'll mute every time I want to complain.
[30:17.57]Now you just sound like you have bad internet.
[30:22.94]Don't jinx me.
[30:24.44]We just started.
[30:26.64]Dude, why'd you kill me?
[30:29.22]What did I do?
[30:32.30]I don't know.
[30:33.14]These are the Mega Man enemies.
[30:34.66]You gotta wait until they show their face and then shoot them.
[30:40.85]Okay.
[30:41.39]Okay.
[30:41.73]Serious gamer time.
[30:45.13]Serious passionate gamer time.
[30:47.71]Did you get any of that stuff?
[30:48.43]Give me that cheat.
[30:55.24]Thank you, Sharuko and Jake Paul, for your subscriptions.
[30:59.16]Great.
[30:59.30]I have a skill point.
[31:00.30]Also, thanks to Renix for your eight months.
[31:02.95]Set up a GoFundMe for getting Google Fiber.
[31:05.91]Google Fiber, I think, is only in three states or something, isn't it?
[31:12.07]I would love to have something like that, though.
[31:15.19]Reliable internet.
[31:16.57]Who would have thought, right?
[31:18.71]Thanks a lot to BurntPieWizardPren.
[31:21.17]I think I got the rest of you guys, but thanks for your support.
[31:22.93]Oh, I can open it.
[31:23.53]Oh, no, I can't.
[31:24.87]I need you.
[31:25.91]I have the key.
[31:28.37]And you didn't want to get that key in that room.
[31:32.15]I couldn't pick it up.
[31:33.53]It's your job to do, like, everything important.
[31:35.69]Why did you just sing-song that to me?
[31:38.35]What?
[31:38.85]I couldn't pick it up.
[31:41.64]Don't give me that sing-song routine.
[31:43.80]What?
[31:44.60]Well, you said that.
[31:45.86]I couldn't pick it up.
[31:48.42]That's how you just said that.
[31:51.30]Don't sing-song me.
[31:54.82]I apologize if I sing-songed you.
[31:57.14]I didn't mean to.
[31:57.98]I don't appreciate being sing-songed, okay?
[32:03.44]We still have to get unrefined rain.
[32:13.24]Really?
[32:15.22]Okay, what is it?
[32:15.72]Are we taking other bows?
[32:22.57]Oh, you missed completely.
[32:23.61]How did you miss that easily?
[32:25.67]Shush.
[32:27.43]It was really hard.
[32:31.43]That guy's still alive.
[32:33.55]That wasn't a headshot?
[32:34.27]Are you kidding me?
[32:35.39]It's 20 megahertz, whatever.
[32:36.93]What's the thing?
[32:37.35]20 hertz.
[32:37.51]What?
[32:42.03]Oh, what the fuck?
[32:43.43]20 hertz.
[32:44.85]20 click rate.
[32:46.19]Tick rate.
[32:48.15]What?
[32:49.81]You know what I'm saying?
[32:50.67]You know the joke I'm making?
[32:52.27]Your stream is a bunch of Overwatch viewers.
[32:53.97]I actually didn't know what you were talking about until you said the actual thing, which is tick rate.
[32:57.95]Because no one has said anything about tick rate in a very long time.
[33:03.67]What the fuck is with this 20 megahertz?
[33:10.95]I'm so sick of these 20 megahertz.
[33:15.11]I'm so... I need help.
[33:18.33]20 clickbait.
[33:22.71]Like, half these guys aren't moving.
[33:26.63]Not moving?
[33:27.13]I don't have any ammo for that shit.
[33:31.83]What?
[33:33.78]Why are these things... These things... These things aren't getting hurt much.
[33:42.39]Will you die?
[33:43.03]Why can I not?
[33:43.59]Okay, I need your help.
[33:45.71]This is like a super elite one of those dumb circle enemies.
[33:48.65]I don't know where you went.
[33:49.49]I'm right here.
[33:51.55]I was wondering.
[33:52.27]This thing has like a million health.
[33:58.33]It's dead.
[33:58.97]I did it.
[33:59.53]I'm your savior.
[34:00.37]You owe me now.
[34:01.95]You see that shot?
[34:03.44]That's one for the ages.
[34:05.86]I thought you were talking about... I'm sorry to go back in time that far.
[34:08.18]I thought you were talking about monitor refresh rates.
[34:11.57]Yeah, the Ting Ray.
[34:13.73]Yeah.
[34:14.29]Right?
[34:14.47]The Bing Ray.
[34:15.71]The Tang.
[34:16.78]You don't like Tang?
[34:24.24]Gotta be honest, I don't like fighting floating balls.
[34:28.26]Nah, I don't like it either.
[34:30.00]Wow.
[34:30.20]I don't like it either.
[34:30.78]This guy stopped complaining about everything.
[34:38.41]My sensitivity still doesn't feel correct.
[34:40.83]I'm gonna have to change it again.
[34:41.89]I think you have to do something over at this marker thing.
[34:51.32]Okay, it's a lift.
[34:53.98]It's a lift into a green ball.
[34:56.32]Not that.
[35:00.10]The thing with the 26 meters over it is probably about the same for you.
[35:04.30]Yeah, I see.
[35:12.26]Alright.
[35:13.26]I think we got it.
[35:15.39]Why do I feel like this is going to turn into clunky Borderlands?
[35:26.56]Okay, what is your complaint per hour do you think?
[35:30.12]What do you think it's gonna be?
[35:32.36]Streams?
[35:33.06]What's the over-under on his complaints per hour?
[35:35.40]I think it's gonna be like 30.
[35:37.52]What did I tell you?
[35:38.48]No one likes me.
[35:41.66]Clunky Borderlands.
[35:43.14]I don't like this.
[35:43.98]Any viewership shocks me.
[35:46.45]Damn.
[35:49.09]Clunky Borderlands.
[35:50.91]I'm telling you, there's like three guys with view bots.
[35:57.40]We've got to get rid of this stuff so we can teleport safely.
[36:09.77]I wish we had chi grenades.
[36:10.97]Alright, are we like... Are we going to keep just getting things spawned on us?
[36:19.14]How does this work?
[36:22.02]I think we did it.
[36:27.66]Make sure you don't miss anything.
[36:28.62]There's plenty of Chi upgrades.
[36:35.51]Oh, I just got the Atari.
[36:36.29]Do you see that?
[36:36.69]I picked up the Atari.
[36:38.55]Proud of you.
[36:38.95]Alright, we can just hold T. Really?
[36:43.55]Yeah, we just need to turn off that machine or something.
[36:47.40]Why don't we just teleport to the machine next time?
[36:50.86]Do we have those kind of powers?
[36:53.54]Apparently we do.
[36:54.30]We just teleport anywhere we want.
[36:56.14]Maybe.
[36:58.51]Thanks a lot, Gunjoy, for your eight months.
[37:00.78]I may say nine.
[37:02.68]And Shrivel for seven.
[37:03.56]Shrivel, what's with the numbers?
[37:04.58]Nine, seven?
[37:06.92]Thank you.
[37:07.38]Shuriko and Jake P. Hall for your subscriptions.
[37:09.55]Thanks a lot, guys.
[37:13.12]We're turning a quest in.
[37:15.57]You act like this is so exciting, like, wait for me.
[37:18.97]What about them?
[37:20.47]Give him the crude!
[37:23.30]20 megahertz ting rate.
[37:26.04]Let's just say you could fit what's left of them into a decorative vase.
[37:28.82]Will you just...
[37:31.55]Okay, first I thought that was him doing that.
[37:33.01]Like, his mouth was moving a little and that was the voice coming out.
[37:36.18]Does Jorma know about the dash?
[37:37.76]If he told me there was a dash, he must know.
[37:40.38]Can we please skip this?
[37:41.82]Yeah, I just did.
[37:43.54]That guy's ugly.
[37:44.36]I don't want to talk to ugly people.
[37:48.04]We get a spell now, I think.
[37:50.56]A possibility for a spell.
[37:54.13]You find that's what's funny to you?
[37:55.67]Only his arm was moving.
[37:56.48]What?
[37:56.66]That's really funny.
[37:57.36]He was making a fine adjustment.
[37:59.92]He needed to make an adjustment.
[38:02.68]Alright, let's go.
[38:23.79]We're really doing a, like, you're a black guy joke?
[38:27.67]I don't know.
[38:30.09]Is there, like, a lot of racism in the Shadow Man universe?
[38:35.31]Just when it started to get deep, you closed it out, because you don't want to see the truth.
[38:40.52]No, you told me to skip every single part of dialog, and now all of a sudden you want to sit there and listen?
[38:45.94]It started to get political, and... Hey, what was the number one rule?
[38:51.24]Don't talk about politics.
[38:57.62]Alright, we just got like a new weapon.
[39:01.64]Did we?
[39:01.96]I didn't know this was such a racially charged game.
[39:10.97]Wait, what?
[39:12.87]It is.
[39:15.18]One day you'll understand that.
[39:19.56]Political.
[39:22.22]Yeah, what are you talking about?
[39:25.10]What is that new weapon we just got?
[39:27.08]Oh, it's an Amulet.
[39:29.20]I get it.
[39:34.09]I got the Deckard Cane!
[39:36.19]Nice!
[39:38.05]Did you get a Deckard Cane too?
[39:39.05]I don't know what you're talking about.
[39:46.02]I'm gonna augment the shit out of my Deckard Cane.
[39:55.78]57.7 DPS, the Revolver.
[39:57.62]How many bolts does this have?
[40:11.68]Hello?
[40:11.80]I'm looking at my menu.
[40:14.28]Life Drain.
[40:14.88]I like these little blades.
[40:20.37]Okay.
[40:26.12]But I wait for Jerma.
[40:29.68]This is like a game of looking at the menu and checking out your upgrades and stuff.
[40:33.07]Like, will you chill?
[40:33.97]You don't have to go that, like, super fast.
[40:41.17]Fucking slow down and smell the roses for once.
[40:46.72]Alright, I'm ready.
[40:50.31]Alright, we have to go search Smith's grandfather's house for ancient smithing scrolls, but that's a tongue twister Search Smith's grandfather's house for ancient smithing scrolls say that ten times fast No, this is a Warcraft quest again.
[41:07.90]I Want you to say that ten times faster, I'm not what was it and I know what it was I can't see it God
[41:23.97]What would I promise to the country if I was going to become president?
[41:26.95]Free candy.
[41:29.31]No more candy being sold for money.
[41:31.93]Free candy everywhere, no matter where.
[41:33.57]Dude, Halloween coming soon?
[41:34.85]Candy is super discount.
[41:36.85]And isn't it more after Halloween?
[41:39.99]You can get like three giant bags for like a dollar.
[41:42.83]I don't care.
[41:43.29]Walk into like the grocery store.
[41:44.61]Walk into a convenience store.
[41:46.79]Oh, that like king size Reese's.
[41:48.29]I'm going to just take it.
[41:49.25]I'm taking it.
[41:50.35]That's it.
[41:50.69]I don't have to even look at anybody.
[41:51.67]I can just walk in and take it.
[41:52.87]Free candy.
[41:55.12]Forever.
[41:57.16]Some of my opponents want to talk about, like, free candy initiative.
[41:59.68]Where are we going to get the money for that?
[42:04.72]There's plenty of loopholes we can close to make the free candy initiative take place.
[42:11.12]We're missing so much shit.
[42:13.22]You know that, right?
[42:14.26]What do you mean?
[42:15.24]Like, you didn't even pick up the two free monies.
[42:16.98]The free candy that was just on the ground.
[42:18.32]You didn't even take it.
[42:18.90]They were two Reese's, king size.
[42:20.05]You didn't even pick it up.
[42:20.87]I just don't need it.
[42:23.51]I'm wealthy.
[42:28.13]Even more fucking free kingside races.
[42:32.89]I'm following you and it's a mistake.
[42:36.13]There's stuff I want.
[42:37.05]I want to pick stuff up.
[42:40.54]You don't want to, like, play this game.
[42:43.26]I don't, like... No, I just want to... I want to sprint to the enemies.
[42:47.24]I do want to play the game.
[42:49.70]That's the game.
[42:51.92]No, it's not.
[42:52.59]It's anything you want it to be.
[42:53.89]I'm fighting Bugwai over here and I need help.
[42:56.59]Yeah, and I'm fighting spiders.
[42:57.77]Because you wanted to, like, sprint forward fast.
[43:02.69]How did you end up all the way over here?
[43:03.99]We missed so much stuff.
[43:06.49]This is the same level we were just on.
[43:09.89]Tell me we missed stuff.
[43:12.09]If you thought you were missing stuff, you shouldn't have left the level already.
[43:15.01]Look at all the treasure chests that were everywhere.
[43:18.58]You're insufferable.
[43:20.80]I think you're the one that's insufferable here.
[43:26.46]Where'd you go?
[43:26.96]I'm right fucking next to you.
[43:31.91]Thank god.
[43:36.79]Wow, my FPS is not enjoying something here.
[43:39.49]Get him over by the fireworks.
[43:47.00]Oh, he's not dead.
[43:48.16]Too bad.
[43:51.84]I don't know why that spider's funny to me.
[44:01.46]Block, block, block.
[44:05.95]There, I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I wanna, like, parry this guy.
[44:10.63]He wasn't even attacking me.
[44:13.35]Yeah, because you're not doing any DPS.
[44:15.09]Dude, if there was DPS charts... Dude, if there was FPS charts, it's probably very low right now.
[44:23.06]My FPS is fine.
[44:25.74]Why?
[44:25.98]I don't know, like... What, you haven't dropped?
[44:32.75]You have an FPS?
[44:34.19]Everything seems... Everything seems bad.
[44:40.51]I love how you're keeping your quota of complaints per hour, and that was your complaint.
[44:47.92]Everything seems bad.
[44:50.84]That's a great guy.
[44:52.24]You didn't even complain about anything.
[44:55.10]That wasn't even a complaint, that was just you stating, like, everything.
[44:57.06]I'm looking at my chat to see if anyone else can, like, see what I'm seeing, or if it looks normal to them, because it's suddenly, this... I think it's, like, the rain.
[45:04.94]Oh yeah, fuck the rain, too.
[45:06.41]I don't like this rain.
[45:13.09]Shotgun's just, like, the best.
[45:15.67]Really just is the best.
[45:17.41]Can't compete with the shotgun.
[45:18.49]I don't know what I just cast.
[45:24.68]We have, like, skill points to put in, too.
[45:27.60]You want to stand around and do that for, like, 35 minutes?
[45:34.78]I don't even think... I have no... I don't have any responses to... Where's, like, Atalix?
[45:38.64]Can I play with Atalix?
[45:40.96]Where's, like, he doing right now?
[45:42.86]Where's, like, he doing right now?
[45:44.95]Like, where's he?
[45:47.61]Can we... Can I switch you out for, like, a gamer's descent?
[45:52.41]Probably.
[46:07.29]I can't go much lower than this.
[46:10.11]Lower than what?
[46:14.22]I'm playing at 20 ting rate.
[46:17.50]Are you?
[46:22.10]Yeah.
[46:22.40]20 megahertz ting rate.
[46:24.64]That's not good, man.
[46:30.31]Come here, you pussies!
[46:34.37]What?
[46:35.57]Who?
[46:36.97]We gotta find the key.
[46:39.07]No.
[46:40.79]Looks like it's back this way.
[46:43.17]Wow, if you hadn't, like, skipped this whole area, maybe we'd have it already.
[46:48.48]No, I'm gonna stay positive.
[46:50.30]I'm not gonna let you drag me down into despair.
[46:53.96]Into the gamer's descent.
[46:59.20]Call back.
[47:01.40]Uh, apparently we have to be careful up here.
[47:03.64]There's all kinds of fucking... There's all KINDS of 20 ting rates.
[47:15.57]Dude, I shot... through his arm.
[47:21.73]Whoa!
[47:23.17]Graphics!
[47:24.81]Dude, this is all procedurally generated.
[47:26.33]Remember when we were just here, like, 10 minutes ago?
[47:34.89]Come on.
[47:42.43]Dash.
[47:49.68]I'm gonna be the tank.
[47:51.52]Heal's on me.
[47:52.02]Are you?
[47:52.80]Heal's on me.
[47:56.99]I'm gonna be the guy who left clicks and just walks out of me.
[48:00.17]Whirlwind.
[48:07.32]Alright, I'm gonna burn all my cooldowns.
[48:10.54]I'm burning every cooldown.
[48:13.56]There it is.
[48:17.17]Good job, Jeremy.
[48:19.59]Good job.
[48:26.60]Amongst all the chat, why are they playing this game?
[48:31.36]That guy's complaining.
[48:33.86]Yeah, but he's feeding off of your complaining.
[48:36.32]I don't think it's not.
[48:38.66]You're conditioning people to want to complain about this game.
[48:41.88]What's wrong with this game?
[48:44.48]Nothing.
[48:45.63]Except for the ugly graphics.
[48:48.09]Everything else was fun.
[48:51.27]I'm, like, very hurt.
[48:52.27]I wish I had... Yeah, I got bullets now.
[49:01.60]Oh, that guy's dead.
[49:02.36]Cool.
[49:06.26]I've got the key.
[49:12.20]I've got the key.
[49:12.98]Alright, let's see.
[49:13.46]Let's go, uh... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[49:14.36]Let me... VCX.
[49:17.38]I want to look at these skills.
[49:22.45]I just wanted to go to the frickin' key party.
[49:34.23]So what is V?
[49:35.31]Is that like invisibility or something?
[49:38.11]Yeah.
[49:40.91]I don't know what X is.
[49:43.14]Apparently I just got one.
[49:50.88]Where's this gate?
[49:51.68]Oh, it's all the way down there.
[49:53.02]I went the wrong way.
[49:53.60]I think we have to go around.
[50:01.39]There's supposed to be better loot.
[50:04.65]Where's my stout shako?
[50:06.62]Not stout, the shako.
[50:10.34]You know what I meant.
[50:11.46]I do know what you mean.
[50:15.08]Turtle.
[50:17.28]Turtles can't move that fast.
[50:18.92]What, turtle?
[50:20.97]Oh, that's not a turtle.
[50:23.49]Oh, turtle.
[50:28.11]Why are these not hitting him?
[50:30.33]Okay, arrows don't hurt this guy.
[50:32.70]Confirmed.
[50:42.40]Alright, that's like a force push.
[50:45.34]What is X?
[50:51.18]I don't know.
[50:51.74]I don't know.
[50:52.66]I don't know.
[50:53.48]I'm not sure actually.
[50:54.40]I don't know.
[50:55.28]You press it and you like power up.
[50:56.70]Alright, let's go.
[51:02.46]Open.
[51:02.86]Let's go.
[51:06.90]Retrieve the ancient smithing instructions.
[51:10.81]From Mr. Smith.
[51:17.16]Ooh, that was a crit.
[51:23.21]Watch out, these guys are vulnerable to electric- Bring him over here.
[51:29.67]What the hell?
[51:33.59]You didn't drag him over here, you didn't do the fucking quarters.
[51:39.36]Watch out, they're- they're vulnerable.
[51:41.62]Watch out, they're vulnerable!
[51:45.05]I don't have ammo for anything.
[51:46.73]Axe!
[51:48.19]I don't have enough mana.
[51:50.71]When does moving knight with stars start?
[52:06.23]I just missed so many fucking times.
[52:09.31]And a guy right next to me, he was like moving in such a way that his legs were, ah, yi, yi, embarrassing.
[52:15.75]Well, we're doing it live, you know, that's what it means.
[52:18.96]Yeah.
[52:19.46]Come on, parry.
[52:30.16]Watch out, I'm gonna spin in circles and throwing up.
[52:37.08]Force push!
[52:39.82]He jumped at you.
[52:40.78]That was not a push.
[52:44.98]Ow!
[52:45.18]He just caught... He just... He just got me.
[52:52.58]I gotta get rid of the chainsaw.
[52:53.42]The chainsaw sucks.
[52:55.96]No!
[52:58.46]I don't get the point of the chainsaw.
[53:00.91]I feel like it's supposed to do something, but it just makes you stand near enemies longer.
[53:05.88]force pull look like?
[53:14.04]Is there even a death penalty here?
[53:17.55]You lose karma?
[53:18.61]I don't know what that is.
[53:19.81]And you lose money.
[53:25.07]Turns out parrying is good.
[53:38.19]Is it?
[53:38.91]Yeah.
[53:40.36]Are you lying to me?
[53:41.40]I'm not lying to you.
[53:42.14]I feel like I'm being lied to.
[53:52.54]I promise that you aren't.
[54:01.15]Ooh, look at that stuff.
[54:04.17]All of the- I'm just saying, all of the trailers for this game
[54:08.52]made it seem like you didn't just dash around and... I don't know, it looked like a different experience.
[54:16.20]That's the complaint for this minute.
[54:19.12]Things seem much slower and more meaningful.
[54:21.58]Much slower?
[54:23.06]Things seem a little slow.
[54:27.51]Like you didn't have to just spam left click on an enemy like 40 times.
[54:31.19]It seemed like when you hit them with a sword, like whoa they get cut in half like dynamically.
[54:37.37]I mean, we're still fairly early, man.
[54:39.77]It's not like, you know, we got time.
[54:45.27]I just, I need to think of my next complaint.
[54:50.05]Your quota for complaints is, you know, you got some more complaining to do.
[54:54.92]I do.
[55:14.86]Oh, that's this big guy.
[55:16.61]He's real big.
[55:17.79]He's an elite torso.
[55:19.59]Is there anyone that should have ammo?
[55:30.06]From behind.
[55:30.72]Look at that.
[55:31.10]Look at all that damage.
[55:32.24]Damage numbers.
[55:34.02]I'm going to sting him.
[55:42.17]Shit.
[55:43.23]I'm doing the full charge.
[55:44.97]Doing the full charge!
[55:49.48]I think it did something.
[55:50.40]I'm not sure.
[55:51.40]Ooh, another headshot!
[55:54.08]Ooh, three in a row!
[55:55.90]Make it four in a row!
[55:56.96]Ooh, I completely botched that.
[56:04.09]No, zoom in.
[56:06.09]Now keep him distracted.
[56:07.93]Perfect.
[56:09.07]He's like, not hitting me at all.
[56:12.80]He's just spinning around.
[56:15.88]Yeah, I'm ditching the chainsaw.
[56:16.94]Chainsaw sucks.
[56:18.68]It probably doesn't suck, but I just don't have anything in it.
[56:25.74]Goddamn sticky keys.
[56:26.80]Thank you, FrigidSword, RedCrisp55, SurtrSchwarth.
[56:33.00]Thank you guys for subscribing.
[56:33.93]And thank you, Zumu Adelisk, for five months.
[56:38.37]I bought people.
[56:39.03]Thank you.
[56:39.89]Hi.
[56:40.93]Welcome, guys.
[56:46.54]Uh, we got a lot of money now.
[56:50.58]Lot of cash.
[56:51.60]We're about to get a little bit more.
[56:53.76]Because there's paper money here.
[56:55.48]On top of the rough.
[56:58.75]Dude, everyone in my chat is just complaining.
[57:00.25]I can't deal with this toxicity.
[57:07.60]More money.
[57:16.87]Watch out.
[57:17.69]Raptor.
[57:23.76]Trying to, like, jump.
[57:25.72]Alright, time to put the bow down.
[57:30.62]Oh, boy.
[57:31.02]Die!
[57:36.34]That's a lot of things in a pile.
[57:41.51]Oh, I... Whoa!
[57:42.41]Where... Oh, that's what that does.
[57:44.89]I just spiked that guy.
[57:47.66]Oh, okay, that's cool.
[57:49.72]That's what X does.
[57:52.18]You have to be close to him or something?
[57:54.04]You have to be within at least somewhat melee range.
[57:57.74]That was pretty close.
[58:03.10]It's not doing anything.
[58:04.26]I don't think you can do it to the big guys.
[58:07.78]Big guys are immune to it, I believe.
[58:11.35]You're just guessing.
[58:12.15]You're just talking on your ass.
[58:13.27]I don't know.
[58:13.93]I'm just trying to figure it out.
[58:19.63]Mmm, yummy!
[58:22.60]Cast Jig?
[58:25.84]I wish.
[58:27.28]If this game had a jig in it, it'd be great.
[58:34.22]Um... So we still have to go get this thing.
[58:41.05]These guys won't stop complaining.
[58:43.85]Who?
[58:45.19]Everyone.
[58:46.97]I'm just trying to have, like, a nice, like, positive gamer stream.
[58:53.37]A nice, positive gamer stream?
[58:55.69]Yeah.
[58:56.87]Have you ever had one of those?
[58:57.87]Well, he just blew up.
[59:09.42]What does the force push do again?
[59:11.26]I think it just does a big shield in front of you.
[59:15.28]I think it pulls things, actually.
[59:17.18]I believe so.
[59:20.86]It stuns them briefly.
[59:21.82]I don't know.
[59:22.32]Hey, Jerma.
[59:23.44]Yeah?
[59:42.40]There's a book up here that I can't grab.
[59:44.98]Well, I'll grab it.
[59:46.54]Did you see that in the new Dark Souls expansion?
[59:49.18]They're having, like, 3v3, supposedly, PvP, like, arenas.
[59:53.96]I heard very, very slightly about that.
[59:56.22]We can teleport.
[59:58.13]We got what we needed.
[60:01.47]I wasn't too interested in playing the DLC when it came out, but that looked pretty cool.
[60:06.43]Is it actually going to be, like, a ranked kind of rating system?
[60:09.72]I don't know if there's a rating system or anything associated with it, but it's just like... You know it's Dark Souls, and they had a trailer, and it's not very well explained yet?
[60:18.03]Yeah.
[60:18.75]But it seemed like an easy way to find a lot of people to fight with all at once.
[60:24.01]Yeah, I'll be playing it, for sure.
[60:29.74]I never even did the one or two secret areas.
[60:32.50]Oh no, I did one of them.
[60:34.64]Yeah, it's tough to do Nameless King, otherwise you're a coward.
[60:41.81]Okay.
[60:43.90]Divert here.
[60:48.14]Force slash.
[60:53.40]I'll do it.
[60:55.14]Whoa, what the fuck is this thing?
[60:57.14]This thing doesn't fit at all.
[61:00.99]It's like a fire extinguisher.
[61:04.33]Okay, I'm gonna upgrade this thing.
[61:06.57]I want this thing.
[61:09.74]Doesn't that just seem like it doesn't... Devolt?
[61:11.32]It's like a... It's a nail gun.
[61:13.72]Okay.
[61:13.86]Let me look at this.
[61:14.70]Let's help, like, build, like, a base for this guy.
[61:18.43]Oh, wow.
[61:18.91]Let's... Where is that thing?
[61:21.31]The Devolt.
[61:24.01]Misrate.
[61:25.49]Clip reload time.
[61:27.05]No.
[61:29.38]HP.
[61:34.66]Life drain?
[61:38.73]Too many things.
[61:41.51]Predictile splits into pieces.
[61:43.39]Each piece deals partial damage.
[61:46.89]99% miss rate.
[61:48.07]What the fuck does that mean?
[61:50.43]I don't know if I want to do that.
[61:55.09]Electrocute effect.
[61:56.49]Yeah, I'll make it electricity.
[62:02.75]Dude, do I want to be a wizard?
[62:03.77]I could be a wizard.
[62:12.01]Can I be a wizard?
[62:14.17]I mean, I know it's accuracy, but... 99?
[62:17.10]That means that you have a 1% chance to hit?
[62:20.66]Or is that... Am I crazy?
[62:28.86]Shoot faster?
[62:30.72]I think I like that, yeah.
[62:31.46]Alright, let me get rid of... The chainsaw.
[62:40.63]I don't want this thing anymore.
[62:43.84]I'm redoing my hotbar.
[62:46.48]Beer.
[62:47.62]Beer.
[62:48.26]Beer.
[62:52.48]Thanks a lot, Mr. Sandman.
[62:54.61]7337.
[62:55.43]Thank you to Jorgen Hi-Fi.
[62:58.49]And Frigid Sword.
[62:59.67]And Red Chris 55.
[63:01.83]And Sutorous Wrath.
[63:02.97]I already got Sutorous Wrath.
[63:05.51]Thanks, guys.
[63:06.29]Welcome to the subscription.
[63:07.47]Welcome to the subscription.
[63:08.43]Thank you, ItGoff, for six months.
[63:10.27]It's not the size of the frog in the fight.
[63:11.87]It's how slippery.
[63:12.67]That's correct.
[63:16.70]Alright, let's do a deck of cane.
[63:31.13]Throw an arrow.
[63:35.07]Shotgun has nothing in it.
[63:35.87]Hold on.
[63:46.20]Damage?
[63:57.43]Damage?
[63:57.87]Yeah, I just want pure damage on this thing.
[63:59.89]Damage radius too, that's good.
[64:10.52]Toxic.
[64:13.48]Toxic.
[64:13.80]Toxic.
[64:15.86]Fire.
[64:16.24]Let's do fire.
[64:28.00]I probably have better ones to put in here now.
[64:34.75]No.
[64:37.79]Extra damage.
[64:43.95]What was in there before I actually...
[64:46.56]I think these are the ones that were in there before.
[64:55.42]Ammo save chance.
[64:57.49]That means when I shoot, I can get a, uh... Hmm.
[65:03.47]Like, there's an 8% chance that it'll just give me the arrow that I just shot?
[65:08.91]Cool.
[65:14.09]Uh...
[65:20.02]Oh, screw it.
[65:24.09]I think this is what was there before.
[65:27.73]Now we gotta make sure I take a look at my super blades.
[65:31.09]No, these are all good.
[65:44.96]Alright.
[65:46.18]Are you ready?
[65:52.02]I think he's buying something.
[65:53.90]Yeah, I am ready.
[65:54.70]Yeah, yeah, sure.
[65:55.79]Okay, let's go.
[65:56.75]Let's do this.
[65:57.27]You ready?
[65:58.51]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[65:59.83]Hold on.
[66:00.49]Where is that thing?
[66:06.47]Huh, okay.
[66:08.92]Let's go.
[66:09.62]Cool.
[66:12.62]We can do other things, I think.
[66:15.00]Other things?
[66:17.46]Oh, no.
[66:18.12]I think you just go there and shoot stuff.
[66:25.20]Hey, thanks, Sonos.
[66:26.96]Soneos, bah.

[66:49.71]I did augment my weapons, dude.
[66:52.03]I'm a killing machine now.
[66:53.61]I'm a killing machine.
[66:57.29]Did you put your skill points in?
[66:58.73]Yes.
[67:01.87]Will you just let me experience the game?
[67:04.53]No.
[67:05.52]This game was $400.
[67:06.30]That's true.
[67:10.34]Imagine that.
[67:12.00]This guy on the bridge.
[67:12.96]Fucking light him up.
[67:17.26]Dead.
[67:20.46]Dead.
[67:22.04]No, he's not.
[67:22.62]He's like, hooray, you didn't kill.
[67:24.06]I split into three.
[67:26.79]Oh, this thing is awesome.
[67:32.97]I like this thing a lot.
[67:44.91]I love how he's standing still.
[67:46.77]I was doing skill points.
[67:48.40]The guy complaining about, we gotta go, is standing still in the menu.
[67:51.86]In the fight.
[67:53.56]Unbelievable.
[67:54.16]What fight?
[67:56.89]I don't see a fight happening.
[67:59.47]Do you see a fight happening?
[68:00.63]Yeah, I do.
[68:11.47]Jerma, really, do you dash ever?
[68:13.79]There's like no cooldown on it.
[68:15.25]I'm dashing every second.
[68:16.73]That's why I'm always so far ahead of you.
[68:19.51]I was dashing every second right there.
[68:21.36]Like while you were yelling at me.
[68:22.52]Guys in my chat, guys in my chat, has Jerma been dashing?
[68:28.60]I was dashing the entire time you were just talking.
[68:32.75]Guys in my chat.
[68:34.87]You should be asking the people in my chat, the people that are seeing my screen.
[68:38.09]Then why are we so far behind me?

[69:38.69]Oh, just to prove me wrong.
[69:40.01]You didn't even start talking.
[69:42.35]Oh my god.
[69:43.13]I'm replacing you next time.
[69:50.13]I'm gonna play this with, like, Burgah Boy.
[69:59.16]Do your Overwatch teammates fucking hate you as much as I do?
[70:01.68]I wonder.
[70:02.42]I have no friends in Overwatch.
[70:11.45]Watch out, watch out, watch out!
[70:21.55]Give me the bow and arrow for this one.
[70:23.57]Nope, no ammo.
[70:29.01]Dormo will find this place eventually.
[70:30.66]I'm dead.
[70:46.33]We're gonna find the missing dojo kid.
[70:49.63]Yeah, we do.
[70:52.11]What is moving around downstairs?
[70:53.33]Are those the dojo kids?
[70:56.92]Yep.
[71:00.78]How do we get into the dojo?

[71:24.37]Free stuff!
[71:32.53]Did you find a way inside?
[71:35.42]I've been fighting them for at least two minutes.
[71:39.04]How did you get in there?
[71:41.34]I followed the diet lines on the map and jumped in a hole.
[71:44.36]Oh, there's a hole?
[71:49.02]Oh, there's a hole.
[71:53.28]I didn't tell you to prove a point, okay?
[71:56.72]I died.
[71:57.24]Why didn't you talk to him?
[72:04.71]I can't.
[72:05.41]I need you.
[72:13.35]Follow the breadcrumbs.
[72:14.31]Yeah, I did.
[72:14.99]I didn't know there was a hole to jump in.
[72:18.90]I think we have a boss out here.
[72:20.22]I see the big skull.
[72:23.78]Follow the breadcrumbs.
[72:30.83]Enemies!
[72:34.55]Shoot at the gas cans.
[72:38.05]Don't tell me what to do.
[72:40.30]What's with the fireworks?
[72:44.12]That was cool.
[72:46.45]Those are cool fireboppers.
[72:48.45]Fireboppers?
[72:50.39]That was a pretty nice firebopper.
[72:58.37]Uh-oh.
[72:59.26]Are those the dojo boys over there?
[73:00.54]I think they have, like, four heads.
[73:02.68]You went the wrong way.
[73:04.74]No, I didn't.
[73:08.42]Radcrumbs fall this way, man.
[73:10.42]Well, now they do.
[73:15.41]Shoot him in the head while he's stuck.
[73:17.97]That's a good strat.
[73:18.97]Are you gonna be a wizard?
[73:21.49]Yeah, I'm a caster.
[73:27.28]That was a little bit of damage.
[73:45.83]Exploded more booger babies came out.
[73:48.65]I'm actually starting to like the chainsaw weapon But I do have a chainsaw sword.
[73:53.57]Yeah, I put all the best ones I had in it Why Perry Jeff
[74:11.43]Don't parry him.
[74:12.17]He doesn't like it when you do that.
[74:14.41]Oh, he's gonna have to deal with it.
[74:16.04]He's currently covered in Nickelodeon Gak.
[74:18.94]So what is he gonna have to say?
[74:23.44]He got slimed.
[74:26.04]Yeah, I'm sliming them all.
[74:27.39]Oh, wait, this dude, the secret slime action.
[74:29.11]He just did it.
[74:29.65]It was open your mouth.
[74:30.89]Are you serious?
[74:33.19]Nice.
[74:33.71]Got him.
[74:34.13]The secret slime action.
[74:40.00]Weren't they bringing back, uh, the Lost Temple or whatever?
[74:42.64]Dude, I used to love it when Danny Tamberelli used to fucking, like, oh, the secret slime action is touching your nose.
[74:48.79]And he would, like, touch his nose, and they're like, oh, it's Slime Noob!
[74:52.23]I don't remember this at all.
[74:54.73]Let's figure it out.
[74:57.67]What's the, what's the current secret slime action?
[75:00.25]Alright, we got, guys, guys, we're gonna have a secret slime action, okay?
[75:04.34]Secret slime action.
[75:05.51]We can't know what it is.
[75:07.65]You can mute and when I do it, you can slime me.
[75:10.41]It's just going to be complaining about something.
[75:12.07]Okay, guys.
[75:13.45]The secret slime action is going... Here we go.
[75:16.74]His secret slime action is complaining about me not dashing.
[75:23.50]Okay, you have your secret slime action.
[75:25.95]You have one as well.
[75:26.89]I do.
[75:27.19]Alright.
[75:29.14]Are we ready to go?
[75:29.81]Yeah.
[75:31.17]Let's move.
[75:31.75]Where's the boss?
[75:33.63]I don't know, but I can't wait to fight him.
[75:36.25]I think he's down here.
[75:40.67]Yeah, we gotta go down.
[75:47.50]Um... It's a pretty big cave.
[75:49.08]I'm coming.
[75:58.84]Oh, watch out for the roly-polies.
[76:01.18]Oh, watch out!
[76:02.90]This is a bad place to fight these guys.
[76:05.64]These guys are vulnerable to ice, dude.
[76:07.58]That's why I'm using my ice gun.
[76:12.55]Ice gun has no ammo.
[76:14.93]Uh-oh.
[76:15.83]My game's starting to lag a lot.
[76:19.23]Because something's on fire, I guess.
[76:21.73]Can I lock these guys up?
[76:23.80]No.
[76:26.07]What?
[76:26.91]I have my graphics turning down so low.
[76:30.84]I thought that was you.
[76:32.48]I was like, what the hell?
[76:33.42]I was like, why are you a different character?
[76:36.66]Uh, we're in deep shit down here, man.
[76:41.89]I agree.
[76:47.91]This is too many.
[76:52.84]Oh, that was a good shot.
[76:53.69]Ooh, that was another good shot.
[76:55.85]What the fuck is happening?
[76:58.63]I dash forward, try and stab something with my turn around.
[77:02.65]Get me up on the fucking ledge!
[77:04.25]Holy shit, I can't believe I got up.
[77:07.88]They're everywhere.
[77:09.02]This shit everywhere.
[77:11.70]Gee.
[77:14.50]Alright, it might be time to go balls in.
[77:26.66]Dude, we're going balls in.
[77:28.12]Yep, we went balls in.
[77:31.32]Might not have been the greatest of ideas.
[77:35.40]Give me that health pack and then we're going balls in!
[77:40.54]I'm gonna die.
[77:42.10]Just stay behind the tank.
[77:44.94]You're not a tank.
[77:45.82]You're balls in.
[77:46.80]Do you understand how much balls are in right now?
[77:50.25]A bunch of balls.
[77:51.15]They're all in.
[77:51.85]I'm dead.
[77:56.71]I'm starting to understand.
[77:57.73]I was killing things though.
[78:04.76]Yeah, yourself.
[78:06.38]I was fine.
[78:12.04]Do you have V-Sync on?
[78:14.59]I don't know.
[78:16.23]I don't think so.
[78:18.07]I'll check though.
[78:18.91]I actually probably do.
[78:24.21]Let me see.
[78:25.01]I've been told I'm an idiot.
[78:27.24]I have full screen, triple buffering.
[78:32.73]No, I don't.
[78:33.16]It's off.
[78:37.09]I'm at 120 hertz refresh rate.
[78:42.36]1920 by 1080.
[78:43.26]No triple buffering.
[78:44.16]No HDR.
[78:45.80]I've turned everything off and everything is low for me.
[78:48.04]I lag in that room over there.
[78:50.06]Really?
[78:51.00]Pretty bad.
[78:52.30]Your graphics card is like three times better than mine.
[78:54.42]That's weird.
[78:55.62]Yeah.
[78:56.08]Maybe that's the problem.
[78:57.02]Are you streaming in 60?
[78:59.86]50.
[79:00.34]Oh, me too.
[79:01.10]I don't know.
[79:01.36]That's weird.
[79:04.09]Alright, where do we have to go?
[79:05.35]That way.
[79:05.57]We have to kill the guard over here that we ran away from.
[79:07.91]Okay.
[79:14.34]Oh, there he is.
[79:17.28]Superior... This guy's name is The Guard.
[79:20.56]Yeah, that's why I said we have to kill The Guard.
[79:23.26]Oh, I thought you were talking about, like, oh, the guard that's, like, there's a guard here.
[79:27.49]Not like Zogard is the boss.
[79:29.49]No, we have to kill Valkar.
[79:30.81]Okay.
[79:31.89]Well, first we have to kill his fucking... Freak shows.
[79:36.03]Wow, he hurts.
[79:40.35]Yeah, I have a 780.
[79:41.11]I don't have, like, anything.
[79:41.91]It's like three or four years old now.
[79:46.53]Damn, these guys hurt so much.
[79:49.93]Dude, we are playing on weighing it out.
[79:52.16]We are.
[80:00.09]Lang it out.
[80:00.73]I don't think I seriously think it's like enemies being on fire.
[80:04.29]I can't look at it's really odd Cuz now that this guy's on fire It really sucks in here Surprise I used to die Yeah, what what
[80:26.99]Did I just do?
[80:28.11]What?
[80:29.43]Wait, what?
[80:36.38]Seriously?
[80:36.84]The boss is just floating around up there.
[80:43.02]Could he stop?
[80:44.10]Oh, this water is... Please, the water is freaking me out.
[80:46.44]I can't look at it.
[80:49.27]How do I go up?
[80:50.77]You have to just glitch it out.
[80:52.97]Where is he going?
[80:53.53]He's just breaking pots.
[80:56.81]I'm sorry.
[80:57.33]I'm just breaking stuff over here.
[80:58.77]I'm going to jump around.
[81:01.35]What's that?
[81:02.94]I just saw a mouse.
[81:06.82]Oh, there you are.
[81:07.58]He's alone in this room.
[81:14.66]There's nothing else in here.
[81:15.40]I don't know how to get up.
[81:18.05]Just do the, uh, do a double jump, dash, dash, double jump, dash, spam, dash.
[81:22.50]Dash, don't, okay, smash, smash, smash, smash, bash, smash, I'm out.
[81:28.18]I'm kind of fucking this guy up right now.
[81:33.15]Boom, get him.
[81:33.69]Nice.
[81:34.57]Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[81:37.63]You know, I mean, I will solo this boss.
[81:39.31]There you are.
[81:46.66]Oh, you just brought, like, a shitty with you, too.
[81:48.44]Dude, I mob pulled.
[81:51.36]I pulled.
[81:51.92]You pulled too many mobs.
[81:56.75]I mean, sometimes when I stab things, my game freezes.
[82:01.65]But that's okay.
[82:02.56]I'm not even going to complain about it.
[82:03.90]This guy has a hole in his stomach.
[82:10.13]Look at the giant cannonball holes in this guy's body.
[82:14.93]It's gone now.
[82:16.65]Oh no, now it's there.
[82:19.24]He was covered up with poison so I couldn't see it for a second.
[82:25.26]Okay, he just fell apart.
[82:28.16]His body couldn't handle it.
[82:31.04]That was fucking funny.
[82:34.48]My god, sticky keys!
[82:36.99]Alright, we're gonna go this way.
[82:39.47]Wait, hold on.
[82:40.01]I'm gonna beep again.
[82:40.63]You're gonna beep again?
[82:42.89]Turn off sticky keys.
[82:51.69]Got it.
[82:52.27]It won't happen again.
[82:53.23]Alright, let's go.
[82:54.52]It happened again.
[82:55.24]I turned it off.
[82:56.64]It's back on again.
[83:04.30]Waiting for you.
[83:07.80]AHHHHH!
[83:08.82]What the hell are you doing?
[83:13.36]I don't know.
[83:13.96]Why are you screaming?
[83:16.74]What was that?
[83:18.54]I don't know.
[83:19.02]I'm not there.
[83:25.09]What was that?
[83:29.61]I don't know.
[83:30.15]You're gonna have to be more specific.
[83:43.51]This is the worst stream ever.
[83:50.55]My windows said one sentence to me as loud a volume as Shadow Warrior when you first open it.
[83:56.19]Why?
[83:56.43]I don't know.
[83:58.13]I turned off sticky keys and it like yelled at me.
[84:02.16]That's weird.
[84:03.32]That's very odd.
[84:05.34]Sticky keys.
[84:06.06]When I clicked apply to turn off sticky keys my computer froze for a while.
[84:16.38]That just gave me an instant headache.
[84:17.40]Got my proton pack.
[84:33.03]Hold on, I'm coming.
[84:33.77]I'm coming.
[84:42.21]Get him!
[84:44.07]What is going on?
[84:45.57]Fire!
[84:45.97]These guys shoot guns.
[84:51.66]I had to reload every one of my guns right there.
[84:55.92]I think maybe it's because I don't pick things up and you do, but I never have ammo.
[84:58.90]That's what I'm saying, you gotta pick stuff up, man.
[85:03.75]That is not what you're saying.
[85:06.12]You wanted to skip everything so fast.
[85:07.58]I just got a grenade thrown at me.
[85:09.96]You know what?
[85:10.40]Fuck this.
[85:12.66]We're going in.
[85:14.20]Ham deep.
[85:16.10]Ham deep.
[85:17.02]Yeah.
[85:17.52]You get a fucking Christmas ham, you dunk it in honey, stick it in the oven, 400 degrees, 22 minutes.
[85:25.34]That's what it means.
[85:28.42]Nice.
[85:31.44]Cool.
[85:31.72]Is this game in alpha?
[85:32.92]Can you stop complaining?
[85:36.35]Ooh, what's this?
[85:41.31]Big guy.
[85:41.95]Superior Serpentoth.
[85:54.11]Grimoire, can you give me some ammo?
[85:56.41]I don't think I can do that.
[85:59.11]I don't think that's possible.
[86:05.35]Could you give me some ammo?
[86:06.93]Can you drop ammo?
[86:07.59]I don't think you can.
[86:10.43]Please?
[86:10.75]I don't think you can drop ammo, dude.
[86:15.33]Come on, dude.
[86:15.95]Give me something.
[86:16.85]You can't ask me to do things that I don't think are physically possible.
[86:20.00]If they are, I'll do it.
[86:22.74]Just drop some.
[86:25.52]Alright, I'll try.
[86:25.96]Wait, okay.
[86:32.32]I remembered the button.
[86:35.25]Wait, he dropped something.
[86:35.93]Thank you.
[86:37.01]Yeah, I dropped that ammo for you.
[86:40.55]Why are we fighting these?
[86:41.40]I don't know, because they're big and they're gonna follow us around, probably?
[86:47.36]I was just wondering if there was a deeper reason.
[86:49.36]Did I miss that shit?
[86:51.58]I'm gonna die.
[86:55.37]Chee!
[86:58.89]Could you give ammo to him, please?
[87:09.10]And... whirlwind!
[87:11.70]Can you please kill an enemy?
[87:18.14]I am.
[87:20.01]Thank you.
[87:21.21]That always catches me off guard.
[87:23.11]I love it.
[87:24.71]What?
[87:25.99]Nothing.
[87:26.35]It's the thing with me and my chat.
[87:29.19]Oh, your chat.
[87:29.87]You're having a little bit of fun time with your chat?
[87:31.76]Mm-hmm.
[87:38.99]Can you help me?
[87:40.15]I shot that guy like five times in the head.
[87:43.41]By the way, I took all the ammo.
[87:45.00]Good luck.
[87:47.28]Who's this?
[87:49.00]What?
[87:49.14]This is like an NPC.
[87:52.62]What?
[87:53.50]Where did he go?
[87:57.02]What the hell?
[87:58.32]Okay.
[87:59.08]There's multiple guys.
[88:01.12]Wait, don't hurt them.
[88:01.92]They're just waiters.
[88:06.01]You got my fucking order wrong for the last time.
[88:11.02]I wanted oyster crackers in my fucking honeydew donut.
[88:15.91]That is just an unreasonable ask.
[88:20.75]Did you drop any ammo?
[88:25.41]I think so, I got it all.
[88:28.17]Dammit.
[88:30.19]Alright, let's go.
[88:35.21]How have I not done the slime action yet?
[88:38.97]How have I not done your slime action yet?
[88:43.19]I don't know.
[88:45.74]Whoa.
[88:47.60]Didn't we just kill everybody down here?
[88:49.12]We have to save the dojo, people.
[88:57.30]Too many... Wow, the whole room is coming after me.
[89:00.06]Yeah.
[89:00.77]There's a lot of guys here for some reason.
[89:06.35]Another hole in the guy's chest.
[89:08.29]Seriously, every time I press X, nothing happens.
[89:11.11]And I'm blaming you.
[89:12.29]Yeah, I'm going to say X needs to be upgraded before it can hurt anybody that's like more than 30 pounds.
[89:17.72]I didn't even have spikes come up.
[89:23.10]Okay, it happened to the waiter.
[89:25.40]It did it to one guy.
[89:26.22]It did it to the fucking waiter.
[89:29.48]Yeah, you must have to upgrade it because it doesn't work on anybody that's like a big enemy.
[89:34.26]Half of these guys are just like ladies though.
[89:36.10]What the hell are you talking about?
[89:39.30]These are like huge guys with sledge hammers.
[89:41.88]No, there was a bunch of ladies I tried to do it to.
[89:46.45]Maybe I have more than one point in it?
[89:49.13]That's not a good place to be is stuffed in that corner.
[89:53.05]Shit, waiter.
[89:56.65]He just tried to fake me out so bad.
[90:00.19]Can I not?
[90:00.67]Can I parry the guy?
[90:03.95]What is going on over here?
[90:08.38]Did you die?
[90:09.60]Yeah, I got destroyed by the fucking... What do they call him?
[90:14.56]The Maitre D?
[90:15.28]What's the guy?
[90:16.43]The captain?
[90:17.77]What is Maitre D?
[90:18.55]What is that?
[90:18.97]I don't know what you're trying to say to me.
[90:24.19]Who's the guy like the king waiter?
[90:25.87]The guy that like runs all the waiters?
[90:28.72]A chef?
[90:29.62]Master chef?
[90:31.00]No, not the chef.
[90:35.05]The guy that's responsible for the whole wait team.
[90:40.65]The menagerie?
[90:41.47]No.
[90:41.73]That's okay.
[90:44.87]I'm going to go with menagerie.
[90:51.11]Actually, I think it's the mostest with the hostest.
[90:53.97]20 ting rate, fucking click rate, fucking slime rate.
[90:57.09]Somebody just, like, said that.
[90:58.25]That was fucking funny.
[90:59.69]Oh, fucking 20 ting slime rate.
[91:03.48]I'm dead again.
[91:08.04]I'm too busy laughing at, like, chat.
[91:12.64]Alright, I'm coming up there and I'm whirlwinding.
[91:21.34]Uh, you're probably gonna die if you do that.
[91:30.19]What is this, a valedictorian?
[91:40.48]Yeah, if I do the spin move with the chainsaw, it's just suicide.
[91:43.98]Because you get stuck on people.
[91:47.06]I did it by accident, okay guys?
[91:48.88]I did it by accident.
[91:53.62]He went for the kick and he's got me.
[92:05.88]Alright, nice.
[92:08.06]Nice.
[92:09.04]Alright, nice.
[92:09.60]Alright, let this guy out of the box.
[92:12.72]He'll give us like a cool reward.
[92:17.84]Why is this guy not moving?
[92:20.25]He's standing in a really weird position.
[92:21.99]We have to go back to the mountain and talk to the Matron D. Alright.
[92:48.16]Nice.
[92:50.91]Third died.

[94:54.49]But you weren't getting far enough in front of me.
[94:57.67]For you to be like, why are you not here?
[94:59.91]I slowed down a bit for you.
[95:04.44]I'm buying the rocket launcher.
[95:06.60]Grenade launcher.
[95:09.10]Okay.
[95:09.50]It's mine.
[95:12.42]Grenades?
[95:12.84]I don't have enough money.
[95:14.53]Yeah, I do.
[95:14.97]What?
[95:17.69]Oh, there's arms?
[95:18.25]I don't know.
[95:20.85]Hold on a second.
[95:21.29]Let me look at that.
[95:26.97]Weapons.
[95:29.96]One trick pony.
[95:31.64]Sorry, what does it have in it?
[95:32.64]Shit.
[95:35.41]Damage converted to fire, plus 30%.
[95:37.41]I should probably put fire in here then, huh?
[95:41.90]Burn effect vulnerability?
[95:43.04]Let's do that.
[95:47.48]And let's also do... I'm learning things.
[95:55.83]Crit chance.
[95:58.75]New secret slime action.
[96:13.58]I don't like this one.
[96:17.22]I'm going to put this one in.
[96:18.26]Extra damage is fire and burn effect.
[96:22.34]Why not, right?
[96:26.18]Alright.
[96:31.02]Oh, and you add that to... I'm learning.
[96:34.58]learning I'm learning I'm learning I'm learning I'm learning I've also have um in your skills go to bullet pouch increase the maximum amount of carried bullets and ammo collector yeah I was I was just gonna be sword guy anyway so okay make sure I have that equipped I do have that equipped
[97:08.70]I need to buy arrows.
[97:12.75]I didn't have any arrows last time for some reason.
[97:16.35]That's pretty cool.
[97:16.99]I'm just gonna fill up completely.
[97:22.47]Hey, ask this guy what he's selling.
[97:25.47]Hmm?
[97:27.57]This guy?
[97:29.10]Yeah, ask him what he's selling.
[97:30.34]I just did.
[97:31.96]Alright, we got two... What do we have to do?
[97:33.52]Oh, we have two markers.
[97:34.36]Which one do you want to do?
[97:37.12]We don't have a quest right now.
[97:43.55]Actually, I'm going to reload all these weapons and go buy the ammo again!
[97:45.89]So I'm maximum.
[97:50.87]Complete maximum.
[97:56.88]I had too many things in my inventory, so I sold everything.
[98:00.00]Because you know what we were doing?
[98:00.98]We were picking up chipped gems.
[98:02.90]And when we do the next level, we're going to get flawless gems.
[98:05.84]So all that shit didn't matter.
[98:10.51]Should I buy that chainsaw gun?
[98:12.07]The chainsaw is just the chainsaw Jerma has, I think.
[98:16.02]Chainsaw gun?
[98:17.46]I bought the grenade launcher.
[98:19.08]The warsaw, that's just what you have.
[98:21.06]I have the pre-order chainsaw.
[98:24.18]It's pretty much the same thing.
[98:27.06]But better, I think.
[98:39.98]Oh, you got to transmute all those.
[98:42.24]I'm ready.
[98:42.64]Yeah.
[98:44.50]Cool.
[98:44.98]I got a new special ability.
[98:50.49]Nice.
[98:52.59]I would show you how cool this thing is, but I don't want to waste any ammo because it only has 26 shots.
[98:56.11]Let's go to do a mission then.
[98:57.87]Okay, there's two markers.
[98:58.71]Which one do you want to do?
[98:59.54]Straight to the right or left to the left?
[99:01.76]I'm following you.
[99:03.16]My game is lagging in town.
[99:06.16]It's not here.
[99:06.64]Apparently it's up.
[99:10.62]I'm not so sure.
[99:12.65]So, we're too dumb.
[99:13.61]We're going to go to the other one.
[99:19.26]I think that might just be a side mission.
[99:22.64]I don't know.
[99:23.06]This might be a side mission.
[99:25.02]You're a side mission.
[99:29.02]Any news about our friends?
[99:31.24]Word on the street is everything they got has already been sold off.
[99:35.18]Shit.
[99:37.40]Oh, energy pouch.
[99:40.26]Did he just give you an energy pouch?
[99:44.00]What is this guy selling?
[99:48.02]Now that's a peacock.
[99:49.61]I want the peacock.
[99:52.03]Direct damage to co-op player as heal.
[99:55.53]19%.
[99:55.81]What the hell does that mean?
[99:59.71]Oh, I want that one, too.
[100:02.05]And I want that one.
[100:02.67]That one's... Holy shit.
[100:04.28]So, what, you can shoot me and it'll hit me?
[100:05.76]Or vice versa?
[100:08.16]That's kind of cool.
[100:12.90]Yeah.
[100:14.24]You have a permanent slime weapon, by the way.
[100:16.87]Yeah, I know.
[100:17.41]So do I.
[100:22.47]Thank you, designated drop.
[100:24.23]Thanks for the subscription.
[100:25.45]See, that's like a flawless gem right there.
[100:29.15]Flawless.
[100:32.13]And we're going to put that in our anime weapon.
[100:38.05]Anime weapon?
[100:39.61]Are you talking about the big thing that you have?
[100:42.66]No.
[100:42.80]The large weapon?
[100:43.98]I'm talking about this.
[100:47.90]I found this on the last mission.
[100:49.20]I don't think you did.
[100:51.39]No, I didn't.
[100:51.85]I don't have two.
[100:52.29]Anime.
[100:52.85]I don't have two lawnmower blades.
[100:54.11]Where'd you get those?
[100:57.51]Those are not anime weapons.
[100:58.65]Those are lawnmower blades.
[101:00.83]Please get it right.
[101:02.58]Okay.
[101:02.72]Alright, let's go.
[101:07.80]We are going to locate the fence called Saito.
[101:11.62]Find out what he knows about the Smith's Grandfather Scrolls.
[101:14.70]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[101:15.88]Yeah.
[101:16.04]Can we take both of the... We're already gone.
[101:17.98]You've left already?
[101:19.07]Yeah.
[101:19.31]Okay.
[101:22.28]Because it sent us that same area twice.
[101:24.08]I was wondering if we could take two missions at once and kind of Warcraft this and have a quest log.
[101:28.58]Probably.
[101:29.42]Probably.
[101:30.86]But I think that was the first time we've had more than one quest in that town.
[101:36.38]So, I don't know.
[101:38.78]We're also getting dangerously close to No Man's Land.
[101:43.21]And No Man's Land, if you don't know what it means, is my internet turning off.
[101:46.89]So we're very dangerously close.
[101:48.85]It's almost 8 o'clock.
[101:52.70]You know, for all the complaining I've done, and for how insufferable of a human being I am, I am having fun.
[102:00.70]This game's fun.
[102:01.90]It's actually, like, pretty fun.
[102:05.53]It has a Borderlands feel to it, but I don't... I feel like it's more... Borderlands didn't have enough character progression.
[102:11.89]And this, like, with all the gems and weapons and stuff, I like it a lot more.
[102:15.91]Yeah.
[102:16.25]That was my major complaint with Borderlands.
[102:18.94]Yeah, now that we're back to Neo-Tokyo.
[102:22.02]I've got full ammo and everything.
[102:26.99]My game runs like trash, though.
[102:28.61]Did somebody just give like a thousand bits?
[102:32.59]How did that... How come it didn't pop up?
[102:34.76]I just saw that in the chat.
[102:35.56]Who was that?
[102:36.20]Because somebody just gave like a thousand bits and it didn't show up.
[102:39.98]I just caught that with my eye.
[102:43.35]Yeah, MajorMahur598 with 1,000 bits.
[102:46.56]Thanks, dude.
[102:47.50]That didn't pop up for me.
[102:49.32]I'm kind of annoyed that I didn't get to see that.
[102:52.14]Thanks, dude.
[102:53.90]And thank you, Jonathan Squirtle and PurpleSuzume for your subscriptions.
[102:58.75]And if you're giving bits and I haven't seen them, I'm really sorry.
[103:00.97]They're not showing up in Twitch alerts.
[103:02.95]But thanks, nonetheless, guys.
[103:07.17]Alright, let's do it.
[103:21.18]Yeah.
[103:21.80]Twitch alerts is all messed up, I guess.
[103:26.92]I want to be one of those girls.
[103:29.65]Oh, I... Okay.
[103:31.37]So you're going to be sword guy?
[103:33.27]Yeah.
[103:33.89]Alright, then I'm going to be shoot guy.
[103:41.41]Well, I can shoot my sword, so... But your upgrades are going into your sword.
[103:47.10]Yeah.
[103:48.14]Can I keep these things still?
[103:49.32]No.
[103:53.53]Oh, wrong one.
[103:55.49]Too many things over here.
[103:56.19]Alright, I'm going for it.
[103:58.47]Let's see what happens.
[104:03.31]Alright, okay.
[104:05.77]Did that seriously take that long to detonate?
[104:07.39]Alright, if you don't direct shot with this thing, it takes like a full five to six seconds for it to blow up.
[104:15.38]I don't believe you.
[104:17.32]It just happened.
[104:18.76]I don't believe you.
[104:19.96]You don't have to believe me.
[104:24.98]Okay, I'm going to do a full charge chainsaw butt blast.
[104:28.62]A full charge butt blast?
[104:30.12]Really?
[104:30.44]Let's see what happens there.
[104:34.11]I missed.
[104:37.07]Well... It's got a huge delay before I butt blast.
[104:40.55]It's a Sonic boom.
[104:43.55]Sonic boom.
[104:46.05]Sonic boom.
[104:47.33]Sonic boom.
[104:48.15]I actually know how much damage it is because I have numbers turned off.
[104:54.43]Why are your numbers turning?
[104:55.62]These are the worst things.
[104:57.30]No, I didn't want numbers.
[104:59.86]These enemies are the absolute worst.
[105:03.44]Wow, you actually did... I think you spiked it.
[105:06.64]What?
[105:08.00]Did I?
[105:08.20]No, I didn't.
[105:08.96]I think so.
[105:11.47]No, you can't spike these dudes.
[105:14.29]Looks like one of them got spiked.
[105:15.47]I don't know.
[105:17.87]I just tried it on this guy and it didn't work.
[105:22.73]Spike.
[105:26.27]Sonic, boom.
[105:28.51]Yoga, flame.
[105:29.43]Yoga, yoga, fire.
[105:31.04]Yoga, yoga, flame.
[105:34.42]Yoga, fire.
[105:35.42]Yoga, fire.
[105:37.00]You're hilarious.
[105:38.28]Thanks, man.
[105:39.88]NP, NP.
[105:40.96]Oh, wait, don't move.
[105:42.96]Wait, no, no, no, don't hit him, don't hit him.
[105:47.48]I can't fucking believe it.
[105:51.69]Did you miss too?
[105:53.41]I have a headache now.
[105:54.93]I just gave myself a fucking massive headache.
[106:09.34]My wrist twitched for a second.
[106:13.82]you're what no no listen because you oh I gotta explain myself to the people watching my stream I was about to shoot and then he's like don't shoot this guy don't shoot knife I freaked out no no you would argue that's my excuse that's my excuse that's okay that's my excuse there's my excuse for you is it a valid one probably not but it's an excuse nonetheless
[106:35.91]You made fun of me earlier, but the excuse you should be using, that I would have used, is that the arrows actually aren't perfectly accurate.
[106:43.68]No, no, no, no.
[106:46.34]No, this was real bad.
[106:47.82]This was real bad.
[106:54.46]This was unforgivably bad.
[106:56.12]Is it dead?
[107:06.07]There.
[107:06.61]Oh, okay.
[107:08.35]Sometimes they do that thing where they fall down.
[107:09.75]And they get back up.
[107:14.60]I hate this place.
[107:17.76]Why is there so much shit on our mini-map, by the way?
[107:20.46]It's just money and... This is what I was talking about.
[107:23.48]We need to collect all the random shit.
[107:25.12]It's like items and stuff.
[107:28.89]There's too much.
[107:29.77]3,000 gold.
[107:30.13]That was 3,000 gold twice.
[107:34.24]Twice?
[107:34.76]Twice.
[107:35.80]Twice?
[107:36.60]Twice.
[107:38.94]Somebody's asking, can you do a random co-op and what's the max players?
[107:41.25]I believe the max players is four and I think it's just drop in, drop out.
[107:45.13]Am I correct in that, Star?
[107:46.41]I believe I am.
[107:48.23]I don't know about joining other people, but it is four players as far as I know.
[107:59.69]I'm going to take out the big gun.
[108:00.76]I'm going to use it.
[108:01.26]I just bought the damn thing.
[108:02.10]It was like 100,000 gold.
[108:05.68]Uh, excuse me, it's not gold.
[108:07.82]It's Cybercoin.
[108:10.22]Is it actually Cybercoin?
[108:11.82]No, it's Dogecoin.
[108:13.74]I believed you for a second.
[108:17.65]I thought it really was Dogecoin.
[108:23.63]Alright, we're going to talk to Agent Smith.
[108:26.67]Where?
[108:27.39]I'll just teleport you.
[108:29.37]Hey, you Saito.
[108:31.09]Who wants to know?
[108:33.62]Alright, use the password obtained from Saito.
[108:35.22]Find the guy who bought the scrolls.
[108:37.92]You got it.
[108:42.89]Cool front flip, man.
[108:43.79]Wang coin.
[108:44.73]This is kind of cool looking.
[108:45.33]Where is he?
[108:46.21]What are you doing?
[108:48.69]Um...
[109:04.21]What am I doing?
[109:05.03]I don't know.
[109:05.29]What are you doing?
[109:07.11]I'm at, like, the next area.
[109:11.32]Oh.
[109:13.68]I mean... What were you just doing?
[109:18.42]Uh, hello?
[109:19.20]Okay.
[109:21.28]Hi.
[109:23.70]Good to see you again.
[109:24.64]Chest!
[109:37.37]Another chest.
[109:37.79]Mine.
[109:39.79]Is that a chest?
[109:40.59]Yes, it is.
[109:40.93]Why didn't it open?
[109:42.61]I didn't even see what it was.
[109:43.45]You got it.
[109:44.23]No, you didn't.
[109:44.91]Where are you?
[109:45.55]Get over here.
[109:47.15]See ya!
[109:47.41]Chest.
[109:47.55]Look at that.
[110:01.60]I think our chests opening is actually a separate... Is it?
[110:05.97]What's that?
[110:06.23]I don't even know what it is, but I'm taking it.
[110:10.07]I'm not picking up any of these mods that aren't like... You can sell them.
[110:16.13]God dear.
[110:16.81]I don't care.
[110:17.36]I don't want them.
[110:17.84]Hold on, there's money over on the couch.
[110:20.10]Oh my god, there's money over on the couch.
[110:22.34]There's money in the banana stand.
[110:25.28]What is that?
[110:25.74]Come on, it's a good funny reference to a show we've all seen.
[110:33.23]What are we doing here?
[110:34.45]Gonna talk to the guy over there.
[110:35.65]But there's money in the banana stand, so I gotta take it.
[110:38.51]Oh, jeez.
[110:39.09]Alright, we're gonna... We already felt like a boss fight with this dude.
[110:44.09]I believe you have something that belongs to a friend of mine.
[110:46.93]Everything here used to belong to someone else.
[110:50.07]It's the same guy that we talked to.
[110:51.82]Oh, shit.
[110:52.58]What about my ass?
[110:53.76]I don't remember Fedora guy ever, so no.
[110:57.28]Quite the contrary.
[110:58.40]It is you who would belong to my ass.
[111:01.11]Okay, are we skipping?
[111:02.19]Okay, we're gonna fight this guy.
[111:04.07]Three, two, one, fight!
[111:09.29]This guy's a chump.
[111:11.10]Please tell me I can spike him.
[111:30.59]One of the guys was standing still like in the default pose shooting at me.
[111:33.95]I don't know.
[111:36.01]When we skipped that, the guy did like a bicycle kick and booted me across the map.
[111:42.84]It was the easiest mini-boss ever.
[111:44.18]Isn't this on hard mode?
[111:47.28]It's on full wang dick wang joke mode.
[111:51.72]Oh, that's a good joke mode.
[111:52.40]That's the whole mission.
[111:53.78]We're done.
[111:56.88]Alright, let's teleport back to Wang Dang.
[111:58.56]Wang Cave.
[111:59.05]What is it called?
[112:02.40]Wang Cave.
[112:02.94]There it is.
[112:07.08]We have to go back to the maitre d'.
[112:10.08]I'm looking up what that word is.
[112:11.82]What is that?
[112:13.10]What is a maitre d'?
[112:20.81]I'm pretty sure that's what it is.
[112:23.91]Maitre d'.
[112:33.96]I don't know.
[112:35.08]I'm spelling it wrong.
[112:35.92]It definitely has a big spelling.
[112:38.58]It's a big word.
[112:45.84]Okay.
[112:47.64]Okay, it tried to correct my spelling to Metro Ride.
[112:51.76]No, that's fucking... Come on!
[112:53.97]I didn't want to shoot.
[112:54.73]I was all tabed.
[113:01.28]It's pronounced Martyrdom, not what?
[113:04.08]Oh yeah, Martyrdy.
[113:05.70]Skip.
[113:05.82]Energy pouch.
[113:06.12]Maximum amount of carried energetic ammo.
[113:09.86]Thanks, man.
[113:10.18]I'll put that to good use.
[113:29.32]I'll put that to good use.
[113:31.06]Melee damage plus 30%.
[113:32.12]Alright, let's take a look at some of this shit.
[113:35.86]Max ammo.
[113:36.88]Max to the fuck out.
[113:39.66]That's what we're talking about.
[113:42.64]30% we're talking about right now.
[113:44.24]Ooh, ooh, 30%.
[113:44.88]Ooh, ooh, 30%.
[113:45.20]Ooh, ooh, 30%.
[113:45.80]Ooh, ooh.
[113:46.65]What?
[113:46.91]I want to look at...
[113:56.43]I want my bow and arrow to be super duper cool.
[114:00.00]Chilling effect?
[114:00.92]Yeah.
[114:03.94]Chance to freeze?
[114:04.98]Chilling effect?
[114:06.30]Yeah.
[114:10.42]Damage converted to elemental?
[114:15.82]I want this to be the freeze bow.
[114:20.05]The freeze bow, you say?
[114:21.95]Yes.
[114:25.95]Damage converted to ice.
[114:29.25]Chilly Spirit.
[114:29.91]Chilling effect 32.
[114:32.30]An extra... Look at this.
[114:33.14]Chilling vulnerability plus 72%.
[114:36.66]Baby.
[114:38.50]I think I'm ready.
[114:39.18]Plus I have a skill point.
[114:41.61]Oh my god.
[114:42.41]This guy has skill points.
[114:44.71]Chill Bow.
[114:47.31]Chill Bow Baggins.
[114:57.13]Wait, what?
[114:59.13]Hey, speaking of chilly, speaking of chill, thanks, ChiliRose13, for your 12-month subscription.
[115:08.83]I summoned him with his 12-month.
[115:10.83]I just got a girthier whip.
[115:12.39]Thanks a lot, dude.
[115:12.95]That's a full year.
[115:15.34]Thank you for your continued subscription support, whatever you want to call it.
[115:19.48]Thanks a lot, man.
[115:20.74]Much love.
[115:22.10]Yes, I'm ready.
[115:23.22]Ready, Freddy?
[115:24.36]So we need to go...
[115:27.11]We have to do the other quest, apparently.
[115:28.49]It's gonna take us to the same place.
[115:29.90]Absolutely.
[115:30.54]Like you were saying.
[115:31.86]Someone told me how to spell that word, but they said if they went in your chat, they would die.
[115:35.58]If they went in my chat, they would die?
[115:38.54]Yeah.
[115:39.72]What does that mean?
[115:40.18]I don't know.
[115:42.04]You said it.
[115:42.41]If you went in my chat, you would die.
[115:46.27]You mean the freedom chat?
[115:49.15]Uh, you mean like the... We don't ban people for writing, like, rats in this chat?
[115:56.67]The freedom chat.
[115:58.37]Can we go do a mission?
[116:02.07]We need to get up into this guy's house.
[116:04.83]Can you figure out how to get in there?
[116:07.78]I haven't been getting any of these bread trails that you've been getting.
[116:10.78]We just have to go up.
[116:11.66]There's a quest up there.
[116:13.90]How do we get up there?
[116:18.66]Is it like a staircase we can climb?
[116:24.89]Oh, did you find it?
[116:26.59]Yeah.
[116:27.39]Okay, I'm currently stuck.
[116:31.41]Dude, you're getting slimed again.
[116:35.31]Come around to the front of the building.
[116:37.05]Front door?
[116:38.33]The front door, and then you go up the stairs inside the building.
[116:44.28]Try this one.
[116:47.18]Okay, well, yeah, the stairs are in the back fucking laundry room.
[116:50.38]Cool.
[116:51.18]Oh, dude, TSM!
[116:53.04]Where?
[116:55.14]Wow.
[116:57.92]Actually kind of does look like it.
[117:00.84]Talk to her.
[117:01.72]I dare you to skip it.
[117:04.40]Talk to her and skip it.
[117:07.64]I need you to figure out what that little shit was working on.
[117:11.16]Hammer shot.
[117:15.08]Ooh, we get some stuff.
[117:18.42]Enjoying your vacation, Mr. Wayne?
[117:20.62]She has two quests.
[117:23.93]Arcane Mastery.
[117:25.05]Oh, I like that one.
[117:26.97]My mage is an Arcane Mage in World of Warcraft.
[117:30.30]850 eye level, by the way.
[117:31.98]Damn.
[117:32.36]Okay.
[117:32.62]So, we can go...
[117:42.58]Yeah.
[117:43.72]Do you want to do the side mission?
[117:44.94]One of those is the side mission.
[117:46.08]One of those is the main mission.
[117:47.02]You want to do the main story mission?
[117:48.08]I just want to fight things.
[117:49.47]Main.
[117:49.63]Let's hit them.
[117:50.09]Let's help them.
[117:51.13]Let's do both.
[117:53.43]Thanks a lot, SoDirty.
[117:55.39]Thanks for the subscription.
[117:56.17]Welcome, dude.
[117:56.67]Thanks so much, man.
[117:58.91]What happened to my paladin?
[118:03.67]They did a bunch of changes to Rett that I didn't like.
[118:06.49]Well, let's put it this way.
[118:07.65]They buffed Rett to a point where they made it really boring.
[118:11.15]Because Rett used to have an interesting combination of moves you could do.
[118:17.02]Now, they buffed Rett paladin to a point where one of the moves I used to do is just obsolete, so it's just off my buff.
[118:25.44]Brags about eye level and doesn't even play fire.
[118:29.42]Yeah, fucking fire, man.
[118:31.50]Arcane's where it's at.
[118:32.74]You want to just fall in with the crowd.
[118:34.28]You're supposed to play fire mage and he's mad.
[118:36.32]You want to fall in with the crowd and play fire, like the thing that's the best?
[118:39.89]No, you play arcane, which is like shitty, but not so shitty that it's frost.
[118:45.55]There.
[118:46.97]I feel bad for all the frost mages that dumped all the artifact power into their weapons.
[118:51.79]You know what I'm saying?
[118:56.54]Like, totally, eh?
[118:58.84]You're missing the chests.
[119:04.42]That chest was terrible.
[119:06.82]What's that?
[119:07.12]Fortune cookie.
[119:07.58]What is this?
[119:10.43]When I was young, I thought that money was the most important thing in life.
[119:13.39]Now that I am old, I know that it is.
[119:15.93]Oscar Wilde.
[119:19.05]Oh my god, there better be an Orson Welles quote.
[119:21.01]I'm just gonna play the game.
[119:22.51]Jerma's not gonna play the game.
[119:23.93]There better be an... Where?
[119:25.39]Hi, okay.
[119:26.75]Hi.
[119:27.44]I teleported to the ceiling.
[119:30.00]I don't know how that happened.
[119:33.24]I don't know how... Okay.
[119:34.70]I'm fighting.
[119:35.34]Fight!
[119:41.33]What is happening?
[119:42.03]I don't know.
[119:47.92]Wisdom.
[119:55.06]Oh man, that resisted toxin.
[119:58.79]They're dying really fast.
[120:00.15]Because I do 30% bonus damage.
[120:01.81]Oh, so you're still muted.
[120:05.79]I'm still muted?
[120:07.19]Yeah.
[120:07.73]Oh, really?
[120:08.63]So did you hear everything I was just saying?
[120:10.55]No.
[120:11.53]Oh, okay.
[120:12.03]Well, I was just talking about warcraft.
[120:14.78]You probably heard that then.
[120:18.24]No, you were muted after you finished talking about it.
[120:25.11]Ooh, nice shot.
[120:28.11]Oh, wow.
[120:28.63]Huge guy.
[120:30.33]Very big guy.
[120:33.47]That didn't hit him.
[120:34.79]Ow.
[120:35.95]He's the biggest target in the game so far.
[120:41.56]He's not doing that much damage.
[120:43.22]I missed him, too.
[120:47.34]Doesn't really hurt him either.
[120:50.30]He doesn't really have a head, does he?
[120:55.55]Clear out all the shitties before we deal with the big guy.
[121:04.69]I'm doing it!
[121:06.96]How many more shitties are there?
[121:17.52]What?
[121:19.46]I didn't chain zap him at all.
[121:22.67]Zap him.
[121:23.91]Cast zap.
[121:27.03]Dead?
[121:27.39]Dead?
[121:27.61]Dead?
[121:27.95]Just big guy?
[121:28.85]Dead?
[121:29.19]Dead?
[121:29.67]I think we just have big guy.
[121:33.29]Aww.
[121:34.79]Now we have to fight not big guy.
[121:37.45]Aww.
[121:40.19]Aww.
[121:43.43]Oh, not these things.
[121:44.35]These are the worst.
[121:45.83]I know.
[121:47.17]Thankfully, I can actually kill them pretty quickly with this thing.
[121:50.69]These ones aren't, like, super-powered.
[121:52.41]No, they're not.
[121:52.81]There's one more.
[121:57.04]It's, like, hiding behind him.
[121:58.20]Oh, it's scanning us.
[122:00.60]Watch out.
[122:00.98]It just knows where we are now.
[122:02.58]This thing actually hurts him pretty bad.
[122:06.20]Ooh, DPS.
[122:10.54]Look at the meter.
[122:12.75]Look at that meter.
[122:13.35]We're talking like 120 damage a second.
[122:18.89]Back step.
[122:19.51]Oh, make a bad reference to a different game.
[122:22.97]Back step.
[122:23.91]Get another back step.
[122:24.93]750% speed.
[122:25.60]Oh, another... Okay, Orson Welles.
[122:29.30]Come on.
[122:32.14]I can resist everything except... Oh, it's Oscar Wilde again.
[122:35.80]Wow.
[122:36.06]Oscar Wilde?
[122:36.94]What's with the RNG here?
[122:37.92]What's with the fucking... I want better quotes.
[122:41.15]All I get is Oscar Wilde?
[122:44.82]Uh, no thanks.
[122:45.66]I want more people.
[122:46.52]I had a sneeze.
[122:56.13]Did you mute for your stream?
[122:57.95]Are you muted on your stream?
[123:00.29]What?
[123:00.91]Did you mute for your stream?
[123:02.51]No.
[123:03.23]Wow.
[123:03.41]You're gonna make us all suffer.
[123:06.25]Yeah.
[123:08.13]I thought it'd be funny.
[123:10.13]Yeah, please buff the quotes.
[123:13.91]I'm missing anything.
[123:15.11]There's a lot of stuff over here that we didn't get.
[123:17.29]Let me make sure we get it all.
[123:20.09]There's also stuff up here that we didn't get.
[123:21.69]Mm-hmm.
[123:25.18]Aye, aye, aye.
[123:28.42]Where's that chest?
[123:30.00]It's right there.
[123:33.36]Oh, those are grenades, I believe.
[123:34.83]Cool.
[123:36.23]Wow.
[123:36.47]Come on, come on.
[123:36.97]Not Oscar Wilde.
[123:41.39]I just become immeasurably better.
[123:43.47]Me read first.
[123:44.55]Sure, you read yours.
[123:47.21]Mine was a quote from Orson Welles, too.
[123:49.05]No, it wasn't.
[123:49.67]So, never mind.
[123:51.03]Don't you dare fucking play me like that.
[123:56.09]There's gonna be an Orson Welles quote.
[123:57.57]I guarantee it.
[123:59.50]Pick up every fortune cookie, because I have to know if it's in the game.
[124:04.40]Why would that be in the game?
[124:05.88]Because Orson Welles was like a champion of the arts.
[124:08.98]Of course he would be in here.
[124:14.49]He was an arts champion.
[124:16.45]Jerma, where are we going?
[124:17.81]I'm getting the chests.
[124:19.45]Oh, fortune cookie.
[124:20.09]Fortune cookie.
[124:21.00]Serious?
[124:21.92]Get to the choppa.
[124:23.76]Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[124:31.88]Oh, come on.
[124:33.74]Come on.
[124:35.08]What's your fortune?
[124:36.28]No.
[124:37.81]Wang's out for Harambe.
[124:41.75]Who said that?
[124:44.49]What public... What figure said that?
[124:49.25]Oh, this game's really funny.
[124:51.31]This game's hilarious.
[124:53.07]Where's the... This is supposed to be like inspirational quotes.
[124:58.82]Not like a Harambe reference.
[125:04.42]Okay.
[125:05.78]Let's go.
[125:06.18]We have to get over there.
[125:14.09]dash dash dash wangs out for harambe Thomas jefferson uh now it would be funny if they actually wrote that but I thought I just died I don't think it would be funny if they wrote the Thomas jefferson parts and it would be at least be like I would I would tolerate it I'd be like okay okay I guess
[125:46.86]I actually don't really like this.
[125:48.92]Whoa.
[125:51.82]This thing is kind of crazy.
[125:54.62]What is this thing?
[125:55.25]It's like a pulse mega shotgun?
[125:58.83]What happened?
[126:01.11]I think you got knocked off the map because you're standing still.
[126:04.99]I was trying to figure out what weapon this was.
[126:12.39]It's like a pulse shotgun?
[126:13.59]Like, what?
[126:13.89]I know, what?
[126:19.55]Watch out for Katana.
[126:23.12]We have to make a reference every, like, 30 seconds.
[126:25.54]Come on, you know how these streams work?
[126:28.44]Reference to what?
[126:29.64]Katana, we're fighting Katana from Mortal Kombat.
[126:31.98]Oh, Katana.
[126:32.62]God, make a fucking reference already.
[126:34.92]Um, um... Your reference meter is, like, really low right now.
[126:40.08]Get to the chopper.
[126:41.56]No, you already used that one.
[126:44.34]Um...
[126:46.45]No address hill.
[126:47.35]Got it.
[126:48.37]Yeah.
[126:48.91]Well, come on.
[126:49.31]Hurry up.
[126:50.67]I'm making up references everywhere.
[126:51.89]This map looks like if Tron was poorly designed.
[126:54.31]No.
[126:55.35]Sorry.
[126:55.83]You can't recycle old references.
[126:59.02]There was already a Tron reference?
[127:00.76]Yeah, like yesterday.
[127:04.02]Why?
[127:04.28]We were talking about how the game looked yesterday.
[127:07.76]You're recycling references.
[127:11.31]Why are you talking to me still?
[127:14.69]You're supposed to be here.
[127:17.32]I'm fighting the choppers.
[127:20.57]There's choppers over here?
[127:24.63]There's choppers.
[127:35.07]We're getting dangerously close.
[127:38.63]It's gonna happen.
[127:39.99]What time is it?
[127:42.24]8.15?
[127:43.22]Yeah, guys.
[127:44.58]The countdown is imminent at this point.
[127:46.60]So let's hurry up and finish this goddamn mission.
[127:48.68]Let's try to get this mission done before the internet goes down.
[127:53.23]I'm following you because I have no idea where we're supposed to be going.
[127:55.95]I don't have breadcrumbs.
[127:57.53]I don't have breadcrumbs either.
[127:59.23]Maybe they took them away from us because they heard us talking about how we're hardcore veterans.
[128:04.61]Of the gaming franchise.
[128:06.78]I'm gonna assume it's this way, because there's a lot of colors this way.
[128:10.36]Well, there's ammo right there.
[128:12.22]No, it's down here.
[128:14.88]It's down this way.
[128:17.22]Where I am, currently.
[128:23.32]I don't know why I'm trying to shoot that thing.
[128:25.21]With a bow and arrow.
[128:27.07]But I was.
[128:29.35]How'd you get over here?
[128:30.97]Bridge.
[128:32.97]Go to the bridge.
[128:34.79]bridge.
[128:36.19]A bridge?
[128:38.47]A fringe?
[128:41.79]You don't see the big bridge over here?
[128:43.00]Look.
[128:44.92]Oh, you went the other way.
[128:47.58]I went very far away.
[128:48.54]Oh, this is pretty much the exact same area that I was looking at, though.
[128:53.54]Wait, no, I hate the spinny.
[128:57.34]I never want to spin, ever.
[128:59.93]Ooh.
[129:01.75]Ooh.
[129:05.23]I like the water droplets on the screen.
[129:06.65]It really adds to my immersion.
[129:08.89]I like it a lot.
[129:09.59]I don't know.
[129:12.00]That's not a complaint.
[129:13.02]God, this weapon is so awesome.
[129:14.28]It's just so easy just to hold the button on people.
[129:22.20]Excellent.
[129:25.89]So much stuff on the ground.
[129:27.09]I gotta refill my chi.
[129:31.57]Lame.
[129:35.22]What's the deal with these things?
[129:38.00]Someone explain the things to me.
[129:39.48]It's supposed to be like checkpoints.
[129:41.06]It has to be a checkpoint.
[129:41.94]Why is it in a box?
[129:43.50]I don't know, because they're trying to ship it to you.
[129:49.20]Alright, this might be a lot of big guys.
[129:54.21]Big guys.
[129:58.41]Wow, that hurt a lot.
[129:59.67]That just did like 500 fucking damage.
[130:01.25]I'm saving that.
[130:01.97]I just went straight through that guy.
[130:05.49]I can do the X to these guys.
[130:08.77]Shoot them in the head while they're up there.
[130:09.93]This thing is never reloaded.
[130:11.50]I don't know why I don't reload it when I need to.
[130:13.62]I'm so dumb.
[130:27.41]Dude, I'm gaming.
[130:28.01]I'm gaming.
[130:28.43]I'm gaming.
[130:28.89]Give me the grenade launcher.
[130:32.97]Screw this.
[130:37.28]I thought they were going to be led this way.
[130:39.96]Ooh, explosions.
[130:44.11]Come on.
[130:48.37]Chain!
[130:50.85]I can't remember what upgrades I had on this weapon.
[130:52.49]I just want to be a chainsaw man for life.
[131:02.20]Fire vulnerable.
[131:03.28]Well, that's why I'm going to shoot you with ice.
[131:09.30]I don't get it.
[131:09.90]Yeah.
[131:10.84]Yeah.
[131:11.16]Alright, keep them off me.
[131:18.97]I gotta do something.
[131:21.09]What do you mean keep them off you?
[131:21.97]They're all dead.
[131:23.17]Why are you always doing things?
[131:24.43]My sensitivity just feels so low.
[131:35.81]Oh wait, what?
[131:37.64]Hey, DP152578.
[131:39.22]Is this the weapon you were talking about?
[131:41.34]Thank you for subscribing.
[131:42.24]And Jarek O'Brien Orbian.
[131:45.47]The mighty Ozone for three months.
[131:47.05]Thank you.
[131:47.59]Where did I get a sexual weapon that you don't even know about?
[131:50.59]What weapon?
[131:53.03]No, that's the thing I was talking about.
[131:55.69]Rocket launcher.
[131:56.41]Super shotgun launcher thing.
[131:58.59]Yeah, it's shotguns.
[132:00.71]It's a shotgun.
[132:02.30]It acts and feels like a shotgun.
[132:03.64]That doesn't shoot like a rocket to me.
[132:05.68]First one up there wins.
[132:07.14]What?
[132:07.58]I win.
[132:11.36]This thing?
[132:11.74]You're not even funny.
[132:18.18]I mean, it's kind of a rocket.
[132:19.60]It's a super rocket super launcher.
[132:21.96]Yeah, that's a shotgun.
[132:23.06]Don't talk anymore.
[132:24.12]Look at what it looks like.
[132:24.98]It's a shotgun.
[132:26.99]Hey, remember when we just did a quest up in this room?
[132:31.73]I do.
[132:32.58]But hey, more experience.
[132:39.86]I'm going to full charge this.
[132:41.28]Sensitivity feels much better.
[132:44.42]I didn't do it.
[132:44.96]I went through everybody.
[132:52.49]I'm going to try to chi them.
[132:55.69]Hello.
[132:56.67]Get chi'd.
[132:59.38]Dude, I have a new Wanglopedia entry.
[133:02.42]What is it?
[133:07.24]Can you not headshot them when they're up there like that?
[133:08.66]Alright, I'm distracting them.
[133:15.82]Cause problems, I'm distracting.
[133:18.23]Distracting what?
[133:19.23]The big guy.
[133:19.53]I have two guys chasing me.
[133:30.34]You guys remind me of something.
[133:31.28]What the hell do these things look like?
[133:32.40]The guys with the blades.
[133:34.62]The Shredder guys.
[133:37.34]They remind me of Shredder a little bit.
[133:38.90]So I don't know.
[133:40.41]I just want to make sure every once in a while I use that ability to no effect.
[133:51.83]What, the X one?
[133:53.17]Yeah.
[133:53.87]I may try to fit one of those in here for this fight.
[133:56.51]I'm telling you, it's only the small guys.
[133:58.93]It has to be upgraded, I would assume.
[134:02.11]Now, there's three chests in here.
[134:03.87]Make sure you get them.
[134:07.67]I just got the dog and cat upgrade.
[134:08.93]Nice.
[134:10.23]Oh my god, I want the dog and cat.
[134:11.51]Why does Jerma get all the good stuff?
[134:13.21]Dog and cat upgrade.
[134:16.00]You wish.
[134:17.34]I want the, like, graphical performance upgrade.
[134:20.59]It's called... I don't know.
[134:25.11]The guy from Soul Calibur?
[134:26.25]Actually, that might be who I think it looks like.
[134:27.93]Uh... What's that guy's name?
[134:31.41]What's his name?
[134:32.07]The big, the slasher guy?
[134:33.23]The weird slasher dude?
[134:35.85]Balrog.
[134:37.05]Yeah.
[134:37.77]So you're the Soul Calibur guy.
[134:38.85]How come you didn't know that?
[134:43.81]I hate that guy.
[134:46.44]Alright, we gotta go over here.
[134:47.24]What if we have to kill that boss again?
[134:48.54]That'd be kind of funny.
[134:52.76]I wouldn't laugh.
[134:53.44]Fortune cookie.
[134:56.01]See if you get a funny meme reference.
[135:00.33]Or see if it's a Nobel Prize winner.
[135:02.91]No, I actually learned a lot from that, and I think I'm going to utilize that in my life, and I don't want to share it with you.
[135:07.19]It was really good.
[135:08.08]Alright, fine.
[135:09.74]I'm not going to share my next fortune cookie with you.
[135:13.56]I hope it's the same one.
[135:21.79]I don't know.
[135:22.25]Whatever.
[135:23.95]Henry Miller.
[135:24.71]Okay.
[135:25.59]Where's the stuff we need?
[135:26.99]Oh, I don't keep any of that here.
[135:28.79]First place they'd look.
[135:29.91]What are you talking about?
[135:31.11]Under the bed.
[135:32.69]First place they'd look.
[135:33.85]Next to the bookcase.
[135:36.71]You didn't even get the chest.
[135:37.85]I already got it.
[135:39.91]You're really slow.
[135:40.57]There's a thing you have to get over here.
[135:45.17]That's not a speed run.
[135:46.87]It's not.
[135:48.48]You're boring everyone to death, Jarmo.
[135:50.70]You're boring everyone to death with your- like, you think you're so slick.
[135:59.11]I got news for you.
[136:00.05]You're not slick.
[136:02.81]Yeah.
[136:03.33]Name's not- not slick.
[136:04.87]Fucking Slick Rick over here thinks he's slick.
[136:06.75]Nope.
[136:07.67]Sorry, dude.
[136:08.21]You tried.
[136:10.09]And you failed.
[136:14.04]Please stop.
[136:19.21]We gotta go to the TV station.
[136:24.26]I've always wanted to be on TV.
[136:36.98]What the hell?
[136:39.74]Did he just shoot me with a rocket?
[136:43.05]He was standing still and both rockets went right by him.
[136:52.46]Oh my goodness!
[136:53.68]Oh my goodness!
[136:54.46]I'm dead.
[136:55.18]There was nowhere for me to go.
[136:58.46]I was like stuck in the middle of them.
[137:01.72]Lord.
[137:06.69]Invisible bullshit.
[137:07.75]Yeah, why don't you guys... Why does the chainsaw sometimes not chainsaw things?
[137:20.95]don't understand my lord too many too many people I bet there's a chainsaw meter I don't know about like some sort of meter you know there's always meters in games I think it's original there probably is I don't look at does it have something on the bottom don't talk to me Jerma
[137:48.36]You don't even use a chainsaw.
[137:49.38]How would I take your advice?
[137:54.89]Stop being so negative.
[137:55.83]You're just doing negative Nancy all the time.
[138:08.16]I'm gonna never use the spin mood with the chainsaw.
[138:11.12]I told myself that many years ago when I was a young ninja.

[138:47.93]A year ago?
[138:52.08]Oh, did I do the spin move and am I dead?
[138:53.64]Salvo, stop doing it then.
[138:57.40]I didn't mean to.
[138:58.14]Sometimes you just press left and it... Get some range.
[139:01.26]Get some range.
[139:05.32]Did it, did it, did it, did it, did it.
[139:13.20]I honestly just wish I just wish I just wish nothing but the illest on this man Can't miss that can't mess that up Darren yeah, that was like a least a year ago.

[139:44.13]Come on, Darren.
[139:48.69]Yeah, we kind of need to get the hell out of here.
[139:50.01]We have to get inside the TV station.
[139:54.96]Come on, let's go.
[139:55.92]It's not a speedrun or anything, but let's go.
[139:58.32]There's a lot of stuff on the ground.
[139:59.40]I wish there was a vacuum in this game.
[140:01.54]There is an upgrade to pick up things further away from you.
[140:05.22]I know, but I want like a...
[140:08.73]Oh, I know.
[140:09.25]That's what I want too.
[140:10.41]Like, right in my mouth.
[140:20.37]TV station.
[140:24.54]Right in my mouth.
[140:26.70]You stopped?
[140:31.34]Unnecessary.
[140:34.16]They all know you want it.
[140:35.69]Oh my god.
[140:40.93]I told you this yesterday, but you're like on a real, like, you're on like a real, like, sex joke thing.
[140:46.35]Oh my god.
[140:48.10]There's like a million balls.
[140:51.42]Your rockets, they're all clumped up.
[140:56.48]All of my weapons do 30% less damage.
[140:57.74]Why?
[140:57.84]Because I have 30% more melee damage.
[141:04.55]Shoot these bastards.
[141:06.51]Oh, I mean, we probably can just go.
[141:08.49]We can probably just go in.
[141:09.91]We don't need to do this.
[141:18.98]There's a big connector.
[141:20.08]Connector.
[141:20.62]There's a connector, man.
[141:22.72]Guy that has connections.
[141:27.02]Dude, I wouldn't fuck with this guy.
[141:27.98]He's got connections.
[141:34.58]That was an unnecessary roll.
[141:38.78]Or was it?
[141:39.26]It was.
[141:40.08]It's a giant ball.
[141:42.26]You gotta kill the connection.
[141:51.58]What is that weird weapon you're shooting?
[141:53.19]It's like... It's called a machine gun.
[141:56.13]We're shooting, like, blue laser beams.
[142:02.08]We're still going?
[142:02.74]We are still going.
[142:04.28]We're still going.
[142:05.42]Stream hasn't even, like, Comcast is going to look at tonight and be like, well, you don't actually have any problems.
[142:10.84]And then it's going to go down again, and then you're going to have to try and, like, reprove from the very beginning that you have problems.
[142:16.21]Well, I mean, they did say that somebody was going out tonight.
[142:19.87]Tonight?
[142:20.67]Well, yeah, like today, this morning.
[142:24.09]Somebody was gonna go, quote, check the node in my neighborhood tonight.
[142:27.89]Maybe they did.
[142:28.43]You could check my node anytime, you know what I'm saying?
[142:30.51]Well, no, no, no, not necessarily.
[142:31.57]It's 8.30.
[142:32.37]Like, it's... I don't know.
[142:35.98]If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen within the next, like, 40 minutes.
[142:38.06]Well, didn't you have one stream night where it, like, went and didn't crash for, like, 8 hours?
[142:43.24]Long time or something?
[142:44.54]No.
[142:45.20]I mean, I started at, like, 5, I think, one night.
[142:48.66]And I was able to go for, like, 5 hours to, like, 8 or 9.
[142:50.46]Oh.
[142:52.62]But, I don't know.
[142:53.18]We'll see.
[142:54.98]Let's find out.
[142:55.50]Alright, we have to kill everybody in here.
[142:59.24]Everybody in here needs to be six feet under.
[143:05.50]Where's my bow?
[143:06.13]Do I have any arrows left?
[143:11.27]Okay, I finally hit him.
[143:15.29]I'm just kind of walking around, reloading my weapons.
[143:19.85]Stay on it.
[143:21.13]Keep it up.
[143:22.80]I'm doing it.
[143:23.22]This thing takes so long to reload.
[143:26.76]My word.
[143:28.66]My word.
[143:29.90]My word.
[143:33.87]Was that my Donald Trump impression?
[143:35.79]It kind of was, but it wasn't.
[143:37.19]I made up for it.
[143:48.82]I made up for it.
[143:49.34]Don't worry, guys.
[143:56.33]Dude, there's so many things to pick up.
[143:58.51]There is.
[144:03.13]Look out!
[144:03.49]This guy's being healed by an unknown source!
[144:15.03]This guy has a little blow.
[144:19.18]Yeah, these guys aren't too strong, are they?
[144:21.88]How is this guy on fire?
[144:26.29]He was just on fire when we got up here.
[144:28.57]We'll never know.
[144:29.55]Wow, that guy had a lot of LED blood.
[144:32.23]That was a lot of that stuff.
[144:36.83]I think we did it.
[144:38.37]Talk to Zing.
[144:41.13]He's up higher?
[144:44.69]What?
[144:45.94]I don't know.
[144:47.32]Go up here?
[144:50.13]Probably like an elevator at the bottom?
[144:51.79]No?
[144:54.23]It says he's even higher up from here.
[144:55.49]I don't know why I expected an elevator door down there.
[145:04.70]Why are you singing to me?
[145:06.46]Huh?
[145:08.60]Huh?
[145:11.16]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[145:12.86]Oh, follow me.
[145:14.17]Follow me.
[145:15.80]No, don't follow me.
[145:16.64]Like, go the other way.
[145:17.30]Like, you'll see.
[145:18.36]Look.
[145:19.14]Turn right.
[145:19.42]There.
[145:20.24]To right.
[145:20.78]Turn right.
[145:22.30]See?
[145:23.66]I found the stairs.
[145:26.39]Wow, you're so slow.
[145:31.39]Shit, now I have to really go all the way around, don't I?
[145:38.15]Run, run, run, run, run.
[145:38.87]Oh my god.
[145:39.77]This guy's awesome.
[145:41.73]I like these enemies now.
[145:43.23]They're the fucking ball world takerovers from Doctor Who.
[145:48.23]Spoilers, I haven't seen that show.
[145:49.31]Spoilers, spoilers, spoilers, spoilers, spoilers, spoilers.
[145:51.81]I really haven't seen that show.
[145:53.01]Uh, don't listen ten seconds ago, everyone.
[145:58.50]Wait.
[145:59.68]The ball is... This is like the one ball that controls all the other balls?
[146:04.74]Let's see what he has to say.
[146:28.07]How much more do you want?
[146:29.79]None.
[146:30.13]I've never wanted any.
[146:30.97]I just wanted to see what he wanted to say.
[146:34.75]We don't kill this guy.
[146:37.57]Head to the spot marked by Zing.
[146:39.15]Okay, we gotta go out.
[146:43.53]We just climbed all the way up here.
[146:47.06]Yeah, we have to climb all the way down and do what he wants us to do.
[146:52.68]There's no fall damage.
[146:53.60]You don't have to worry about that.
[147:08.08]Where are you going?
[147:09.28]Where are you going?
[147:12.44]Proving how much faster than you are.
[147:15.50]Everyone in my chat is just like, oh my god, Ster is a god-tier gamer.
[147:19.04]He's so much better than Jerma.
[147:20.80]Hold on, wait.
[147:22.12]Was it in that fucking room we just were in?
[147:24.75]No, you have to go outside.
[147:27.43]How did you get out there so much faster than I did?
[147:30.91]That's what I'm saying.
[147:31.89]I don't understand.
[147:33.13]How is that even possible?
[147:35.63]You didn't even... You know...
[147:37.73]How did you get here this fast?
[147:39.99]Like, I followed the breadcrumb trail, like I was always told to do, and it took me around East Shitville.
[147:45.93]Don't follow the breadcrumb trail, you shitty.
[147:47.95]You were telling me to follow the bloodcrumb trail.
[147:57.33]Okay, let's not.
[147:59.09]Let's not.
[147:59.65]Okay, let's not.
[148:00.29]Fine.
[148:13.15]Oh, cool moves.
[148:16.41]There's so many balls.
[148:17.67]Yeah, this was not a good idea to come up this quick.
[148:21.46]Just drop all your missiles, whatever you have.
[148:24.32]Now they're connected.
[148:26.56]That's great.
[148:30.40]And now I'm seeing frame problems.
[148:33.90]Finally.
[148:36.10]I'm not alone.
[148:36.82]Oh yeah, these things are like glitching around a little bit too.
[148:47.27]I like using this thing with the balls, it's the best.
[148:49.01]I don't need a machine gun, it's just, you don't have to like, aim, you know, you don't have to worry about them flying around or anything.
[148:56.94]Wow, I'm at like 20 FPS, that's not cool.
[149:10.17]What are these grenades, though?
[149:19.41]The frames.
[149:21.49]The frames.
[149:23.91]This is one little idiot.
[149:28.90]What?
[149:31.20]Die.
[149:31.68]What the?
[149:35.50]You gotta wait until they stop and do that scan move.
[149:37.75]We have to fight them inside neon clouds to begin with.
[149:41.71]Like, stay still.
[149:44.99]We got some new skills.
[149:48.80]Did we?
[149:50.68]I didn't.
[149:53.78]Retrieve a bunch of notebooks.
[149:55.09]We have two more notebooks to get, but put your skill point in.
[149:57.61]I don't have a skill point.
[150:01.61]I do.
[150:03.11]Oh, there's a big dude, big dude, big dude.
[150:05.41]You can handle it.
[150:15.54]I mean, I appreciate help.
[150:21.33]You're fine.
[150:21.63]Yeah, you're fine.
[150:25.07]You got him.
[150:25.37]He's not that big.
[150:31.75]They're asking me if that's all I've got.
[150:33.87]But I have a friend.
[150:34.75]He's just not showing up.
[150:37.16]I'm right behind you.
[150:37.90]I'm shooting.
[150:38.48]I got plenty of damage on this guy now.
[150:43.88]Wow, she slowly dodged that.
[150:47.94]Please seem like I can get her.
[150:48.94]No, I can't.
[150:49.44]Of course not.
[150:51.08]Of course not.
[150:55.47]Oh, there's the peacock.
[150:57.63]That's the healing thing.
[151:00.01]Didn't even need to spend like $100,000, $200,000 for that.
[151:03.07]For what?
[151:06.79]I got like the peacock healing thing.
[151:09.13]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[151:11.59]What the hell is that?
[151:13.31]Something is just shooting the hell out of me.
[151:20.50]Oh, dude, look at the DPS charts.
[151:24.02]I know, look at them.
[151:27.46]Look at them.
[151:29.02]They must be rolling in DPS.
[151:34.54]Hello, ladies.
[151:36.70]Oh, who talks to you?
[151:38.97]Duh.
[151:46.45]Duh.
[151:47.83]My name's Duh.
[151:54.76]Triple shot.
[151:55.90]Nice.
[151:56.34]Hooray.
[152:01.12]Check your Skada.
[152:05.45]Yeah, check your Skada, man.
[152:06.63]What does it say?
[152:10.27]Eye of the what?
[152:11.95]Check your Skada.
[152:17.10]I bet you can't make this jump, and I bet you I can.
[152:19.20]Make what jump?
[152:25.02]Okay.
[152:31.58]That's fucking easy.
[152:32.54]You really don't have that much confidence that I'll make that?
[152:36.58]It looks harder than it once did.
[152:38.79]That was just like a standard sprint jump.
[152:49.27]Check my Tinder.
[152:53.00]You guys are vulnerable to fire.
[152:54.02]If you got it, you use it.
[152:55.78]I don't.
[152:56.18]Why am I even doing this?
[153:08.95]Doing what?
[153:13.24]What's the issue?
[153:15.48]I'm... using guns.
[153:18.98]I sh... I can't... I can't.
[153:22.96]Can we check the Scotto on that one?
[153:30.75]Mighty.
[153:31.13]There's these fucking balls!
[153:34.55]Yeah, they are like the worst enemy.
[153:39.80]I just want to go back to, like, Japan.
[153:42.78]We will after this quest.
[153:46.62]Like, this isn't... Yeah, like, what do you think we are right now?
[153:48.86]Where are we?
[153:49.24]I don't know.

[154:20.58]Like, they try and, like, make a story.
[154:22.72]It's, like, honestly.
[154:23.94]Oh, didn't get this one.
[154:31.17]Alright, I've got... Alright.

[155:28.43]They just ran so fast.
[155:34.54]Where's my rocket launcher?
[155:36.10]I know, that's what I'm looking for too.
[155:37.32]Give it to me, give it to me.
[155:39.90]No, actually this is good too.

[155:53.60]Warframe.
[155:56.24]A little bit, yeah.
[155:57.12]It really does.

[156:33.88]The sprinter.
[156:34.64]Look at that chi.
[156:39.74]Maybe you should have ran ahead.
[156:42.96]I'm at the spot where we need to be.
[156:45.90]Just come down here.
[156:46.68]We just have to kill the things attached to the wires.
[156:52.63]Superior dolls.
[156:54.57]I might have brought the katanas down here.
[157:00.53]I might have.
[157:02.37]Yeah, you think you did.
[157:09.33]This one elite scorpion...

[157:26.13]Alright, I think we're good.
[157:28.59]Is this framerate really bad for anyone else?
[157:32.33]It's bad for me.
[157:33.38]It's bad for everyone.
[157:34.34]It's bad for Jerma.
[157:36.52]The game does not seem optimized.
[157:38.04]That wasn't too terrible.
[157:41.68]It's been worse for me, but yeah.
[157:44.11]Alright, we're done.
[157:45.01]Soul of package, dude.

[158:42.45]I don't like Larry.
[158:43.67]Who knows?
[158:45.27]I'm not going to count my chickens before they hatch, but... He has no nipples.
[158:51.55]We're getting to 9 p.m.
[158:52.73]Eastern, so... Lorag is ready to rip the cord out.
[158:56.93]We'll see when he does it.
[159:01.81]Can I turn this in, or are you going to... Are you doing something?
[159:05.33]I'll do it.
[159:07.54]Okie dokie.
[159:19.84]Oh, you can actually pick what you want here.
[159:21.82]Hammer shot?
[159:23.88]Or the Geno?
[159:25.44]I don't have an option.
[159:28.24]I do.
[159:31.83]I already have a grenade launcher.
[159:34.39]Definitely automatic shotgun.
[159:35.31]Are you kidding me?
[159:38.41]Oh, because I just get what you pick.
[159:40.15]Well, hope you like automatic shotguns.
[159:42.89]Uh, if it's not a sword, it doesn't matter.
[159:49.08]You're gonna like this one.
[159:50.96]Take a look at what you can get for this.
[159:52.58]Star loves to go fast.
[159:56.82]What?
[159:57.69]It's a new skill point you can put in to move faster.
[160:04.09]Where?
[160:06.48]When we complete this mission, you're going to get a new card.
[160:08.58]You're lying to me.
[160:09.26]I'm not.
[160:09.74]I promise.
[160:22.92]Ammo.
[160:24.66]Alright.
[160:28.20]Hammer shot.
[160:33.01]I wouldn't want to increase its speed because you want it
[160:37.39]Well, your movement speed, I mean.
[160:38.65]I think it's like a straight up movement speed.
[160:39.65]No, I'm talking about something else.
[160:40.57]If I just save my points for that, then whatever.
[160:51.37]Ooh, fire rate.
[160:53.36]I like that.
[160:59.02]Do I have anything better now to put in this?
[161:02.65]Oh yeah, that one's great.
[161:03.91]Soul of Ice.
[161:05.63]Was that one already in there?
[161:06.51]I don't think so.
[161:30.76]Miss rate.
[161:34.59]Reload.
[161:42.06]Dude, you lame.
[161:42.94]Ammo usage.
[161:45.98]Actually, double packs?
[161:48.91]Oh, hell yeah.
[161:55.77]Critical damage bonus.
[161:56.81]I want that one again.
[162:09.23]Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.
[162:12.41]I don't like that one.

[162:39.63]Yeah, dude.
[162:40.49]What is it, dude?
[162:40.93]Alright, the monsoon.
[162:45.77]Dude, you do not want the monsoon.
[162:52.02]486 damage.
[162:53.30]My god.
[162:54.14]Yeah, I'm sure it's going to shoot two at the same time.
[162:57.44]That's going to be insane.
[162:58.12]I'm going to get it right up to somebody's face and do that.
[162:59.98]Dude, you don't want that, dude.
[163:01.28]I do.
[163:02.10]Stop.

[164:00.43]All ammo.
[164:03.89]Oh, hooray.
[164:08.27]I bet you this AR-53 is really good.
[164:12.48]Probably.
[164:17.55]Improves the properties of fire upgrades, I think.
[164:24.19]I'm buying that.
[164:29.65]Do I have enough?
[164:30.11]Can I do anything with that at the moment?
[164:31.86]No, I'm going to stop putting points in this and get fire gems and be fire dude.
[164:41.20]Cool.
[164:42.30]But what if the enemy is immune to fire?
[164:43.98]Then you're going to have to deal with them.
[164:47.78]You ready?
[164:50.38]Seepage problem.
[164:52.24]Search the wilderness for the source of the mysterious black ooze.
[164:57.94]Come over to Gem Seller Guy, because he does sell some pretty super gem cells.
[165:01.60]Super gems?
[165:05.88]Okie dokie.
[165:14.77]What are you selling?
[165:17.15]Chilling... Wow, those are crazy.
[165:19.73]Yeah.
[165:21.25]She drained this one.
[165:23.43]Chilling effect plus 43.
[165:24.21]27% damage converted to ice.
[165:29.47]Oh, he sells skills, too.
[165:30.39]I didn't even know that.
[165:31.61]Yeah, the little thing there.
[165:33.17]I think they all do.
[165:38.22]Though, if you're doing ice, I would highly suggest, if you're doing ice weapons, get Chili Core, because, my God, these are new.
[165:44.88]Plasma Cutters.
[165:47.41]I have like no money now.
[165:48.93]Did you look at these?
[165:49.87]Plasma cutters?
[165:50.51]I have $13,000.
[165:50.89]So in short, I don't even worry about it.
[165:53.22]Okie dokie.
[165:53.82]You ready to go?
[165:55.90]One more thing.
[165:56.26]Oh, and by the way, I want it now.
[166:22.52]Isaac's plasma cutters.
[166:24.94]Okay, I'm ready.
[166:29.49]Starting this story mission will mark a point of no return.
[166:33.29]Uh-oh.
[166:34.23]Should we do the point of no return or any unfinished side missions?
[166:37.29]Dude, I'm ready.
[166:38.81]We're done.
[166:39.55]Point of no return.
[166:43.47]Why does it keep showing this guy driving the same car?
[166:47.46]It's just a guy driving a car.
[166:49.98]What's wrong with driving cars?
[166:51.38]It just feels like, alright, is there anything else you can put here?
[166:53.84]Like a demon or a big guy with a big face?
[166:55.90]No, it's a guy driving a car.
[167:01.62]No rewinds.
[167:03.68]It's true.
[167:04.88]No rewinds.
[167:07.88]Mine's a guy with a selfie stick.
[167:18.27]Game literally over in five hours.
[167:21.60]How much percentage do we have done?
[167:22.74]Can you even look?
[167:25.14]I don't know.
[167:27.64]Yeah, we were here before.
[167:28.40]I remember because this is where the fucking aspect of the cheetah was.
[167:31.64]Yep.
[167:35.84]Investigate the outer gates.
[167:38.48]Investigate the cheetahs.
[167:42.24]Is that a wailing soul?
[167:43.50]Oh, okay.
[167:43.80]There's the gatekeeper.
[167:47.34]He's vulnerable to a lot of stuff, but he's in electric resistance.
[167:49.92]Okay, this has like heavy rock music.
[167:56.00]You know that this is like a big deal right now.
[168:00.77]Hold on a second.
[168:01.33]Hold on.
[168:01.57]Keep him busy.
[168:03.01]What?
[168:03.29]What?
[168:08.65]That didn't even turn it up.
[168:09.47]I was trying to turn up the music.
[168:14.78]What the hell?
[168:15.86]What is he vulnerable to?
[168:17.48]I can't read him because there's so many dudes around.
[168:19.42]He's vulnerable to... Hold on.
[168:21.40]I think he's electric vulnerable.
[168:27.67]You said he was... Wait, let me see.
[168:29.93]Okay, he's fire vulnerable, fire vulnerable.
[168:32.39]Fire.
[168:32.63]It's so hard.
[168:33.19]It pops on the screen for two seconds.
[168:35.24]I'm dead.
[168:47.79]Oh my God.
[168:48.99]He's on the bridge over here.
[168:52.63]There we go.
[168:53.51]I'm going to need you to start playing.
[168:55.67]That bridge has every single enemy on it.
[169:04.70]Oh, my game's lagging so bad.
[169:07.08]Why are they all over you?
[169:11.68]Oh my God.
[169:19.71]It just comes out of nowhere.
[169:27.87]Why are they all over here?
[169:30.56]Get off the fucking bridge!
[169:39.44]Get pumped the fuck up!
[169:47.89]Okay, I gotta turn this top.
[169:53.98]Alright, we're good.
[169:54.44]Don't worry.
[169:55.44]No, check the Skada, by the way.
[169:57.26]Check the Skada.
[170:02.48]I'm about to get a lot of damage.
[170:03.60]I don't know what you're talking about.
[170:07.04]Watch out.
[170:07.34]Here's the Gatekeeper.
[170:08.56]He's back.
[170:11.38]Holy shit.
[170:11.90]I just did a lot of damage to him.
[170:14.62]Oh, boy.
[170:16.44]You want to check that Skada?
[170:17.48]You can check it now if you like.
[170:18.60]This guy's taking a hell of a lot of damage.
[170:27.55]Is he?
[170:28.29]Yeah.
[170:28.91]Is he?
[170:29.95]Yes, he was.
[170:30.45]Pick up the key, pick up the key, pick up the key, pick up the key, pick up the key, pick up the key, pick up the key, pick up the key, pick up the key, pick up the key.
[170:38.47]I'm trying to help.
[170:39.81]You're just being a butthead.
[170:48.51]Five second downtime?
[170:49.41]That's a 50 DKP minus.
[170:52.62]No, not my dragon killer points.
[170:54.14]I need those.
[170:57.23]Alright, let's go get the gate.
[171:03.94]Wait.
[171:06.52]Okay.
[171:06.68]Do I have to go through the spider cave?
[171:08.54]Are you kidding me?
[171:10.68]Whoa, that is cool, actually.
[171:11.82]This is actually kind of cool.
[171:15.19]The spider kingdom.
[171:17.53]We've been here before.
[171:26.57]Going for like a huge air shot Didn't get it I like the grenade launcher.
[171:37.89]It's fun to use Everything here is fire vulnerable to so you should be slamming.
[171:44.56]I am I am slamming Physical resist you can't even hurt these guys
[171:58.31]I've seen a lot of physical resist, actually.
[172:02.21]I mean, most of my weapon is, like, poison.
[172:06.22]Oh, really?
[172:06.74]That's cool.
[172:08.66]Okay, huge guy.
[172:09.40]That's a big guy.
[172:10.20]That is a huge guy.
[172:10.80]This guy's an ice vulnerable.
[172:16.28]Vulnerable to ice.
[172:18.53]If I could actually hit the fucking guy.
[172:20.25]You know what?
[172:21.03]Fine.
[172:23.79]You're giving me too much rock music, and I can't concentrate.
[172:32.15]Oh my god.
[172:33.87]I did not expect the jump at me.
[172:45.76]Dead.
[172:53.64]That's a lot of health.
[172:54.26]Dead.
[172:54.62]He died.
[172:57.89]He died.
[172:59.95]If only I knew the jump.
[173:08.55]Checkpoint.
[173:15.72]I wanted to pick up stuff, but you're so impatient.
[173:25.40]Money.
[173:26.06]Make sure you don't miss it.
[173:35.07]Old ancient tomb with money.
[173:42.66]tell us how quickly that was just skipped not even a chance alright we have dudes here oh what's wrong I bet you I can get these yeah I can thank god I can actually use that move
[174:14.57]Is this guy vulnerable?
[174:15.19]Nothing.
[174:17.09]He's just a large dude.
[174:19.23]Just a huge guy.
[174:20.27]Okay.
[174:20.61]I think we can handle that.
[174:38.16]No vulnerabilities.
[174:39.98]Interesting, huh?
[174:41.02]Interesting.
[174:47.20]You think we're gonna beat this game, like, right now?
[174:49.20]Uh, I think there's endgame to it as well.
[174:53.58]Where you keep getting, like, Diablo items and shit.
[174:57.38]Also, you've been on, like, two different maps.
[175:00.57]I'd be really shocked if we beat this game.
[175:03.07]I mean, we were, like, 12% through the game after the first mission.
[175:08.55]I see we're in, like, the demon zone right now.
[175:10.29]I feel like the demon zone is one of the, like, at least halfway zones.
[175:16.80]I don't think we will ever beat this team.
[175:19.60]I don't believe in us.
[175:21.96]We haven't had any issues so far.
[175:24.74]How can you not believe in us as a team?
[175:26.08]I love that.
[175:33.52]Remember when we used to be a team?
[175:35.20]We used to be a good team in games.
[175:39.10]And what happened?
[175:41.50]You tell me.
[175:42.18]What happened?
[175:44.32]Hey, I'm the one that asked you to play Shadow Warrior.
[175:46.46]I'm always the one that asks you to play games now.
[175:49.32]Dispute it?
[175:50.36]Dispute it?
[175:50.84]I will.
[175:51.28]You want me to dispute it?
[175:52.02]Jerma Sunday on my stream?
[175:53.40]Hey, come on my stream on Sundays.
[175:57.83]That was because I wanted to be a good team.
[175:59.33]Hey, want to play Dungeons & Dragons?
[176:01.39]Hey, you want to get obsessed with Overwatch?
[176:05.41]And that's what you do every fucking day?
[176:08.97]That's what happened.
[176:11.66]Playing this with you right now.
[176:13.70]Yeah, because you're getting irritated at Overwatch.
[176:17.54]The last couple of days.
[176:20.74]I wanted to play a lot of Overwatch.
[176:22.08]The last couple of days you were really upset at Overwatch.
[176:25.73]Okay.
[176:29.31]I remember the old star.
[176:32.25]Who remembers the old star?
[176:33.89]I do.
[176:35.53]Whatever happened to late night live commentary?
[176:40.12]So I'm doing the stream tomorrow night where I just, it'd be cool to hang out on a stream and like watch old videos.
[176:44.86]That's like, sounds like a fun idea and talk about it afterwards maybe.
[176:48.65]I tweeted about that.
[176:49.79]Most of the tweets were very mad at me.
[176:52.49]Wait, what do you mean watch old videos?
[176:55.41]It's just on stream, like watch them together.
[176:57.13]So you have like, it's like a movie night.
[176:59.96]Is this like a sniper after?
[177:03.78]Listen carefully for the dropped Skype call sound.
[177:09.39]Good conversation.
[177:10.59]Fucking loser.
[177:14.53]Oh, man.

[177:47.82]I've, uh, I've always, everything out of my mouth, every single thing I say is a sarcastic comment.
[177:56.89]It's, oh, sarcasm.
[177:58.71]Every fucking sentence is sarcasm.
[178:04.39]This is what happens, you just stop liking me.
[178:05.89]You wonder why fucking Burgah Boy doesn't like you.
[178:09.61]No, I know why he doesn't like me.
[178:12.16]But you, you've changed.
[178:15.58]Can't you just chill and hang out?
[178:17.44]That's a huge fucking enemy.
[178:20.50]I hope that thing doesn't come alive.
[178:25.96]Oh, this is like the first boss of the game.
[178:27.90]I think we're almost done with it.
[178:29.26]We're almost done.
[178:32.96]Right in the head.
[178:33.40]Headshots.
[178:33.73]Watch out for the aliens.
[178:44.74]Elite Belly.
[178:45.90]I like the name.
[178:52.98]Oh, I hit the bell.
[178:53.80]I hit the bell again.
[178:55.46]Oh, get it, belly.
[178:57.20]This guy doesn't really know what he's doing right now.
[178:58.88]Perkaboy versus Star, please.
[179:00.33]Whatever, he almost killed us all in this card.
[179:02.43]Please return here with all haste.
[179:24.78]That's really cool looking.
[179:27.20]I wish this thing came alive.
[179:29.26]Based on the dialog, it sounded like he was the final boss of the last game.
[179:37.04]Was he?
[179:38.24]That's what it sounded like.
[179:40.41]Thanks a lot, ZamWim.
[179:40.99]He said I defeated him last time by blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
[179:44.25]Thanks for the sub, ZamWim.
[179:45.57]Welcome, dude.
[179:45.95]That probably means last game.
[179:50.31]Is that really what it means?
[179:55.21]We'll find out.
[179:59.06]Is that the one boss from the first game?
[180:01.70]Was it?
[180:07.28]What's the lore between Burke of Fire and Star?
[180:13.13]Alright, big trouble in Calamity.
[180:18.55]I feel like... I feel like we're in Reach the Town.
[180:23.61]I don't know.
[180:24.15]This was like an automatic teleport.
[180:25.33]I didn't do this, by the way.
[180:27.11]Yeah.
[180:29.79]There's big trouble here.
[180:31.44]It's the first vehicle we've seen in a long time.
[180:38.18]Come on.
[180:38.44]Did you get that chest?
[180:40.14]Yeah.
[180:45.21]Alright.
[180:45.75]Reach the top.
[180:47.09]Reach the town on top of Dragon Mountain.
[180:55.82]Big mech guy.
[180:57.88]Shoot him!
[181:00.76]This auto shot is awesome.
[181:03.94]It's just he can't even do anything.
[181:06.96]Now he can because I have to reload.
[181:14.38]Oh, you guys talking about a horror game?
[181:16.24]I want to play a horror game for October.
[181:19.76]Are there any good ones?

[181:24.96]He sent a bargain to come on like the game's almost over Cuz I would love to play one layers of fear was actually really fun repeat the game was really weird We did not be still a guy over here
[181:48.29]I gotta get rid of that.
[181:49.91]Just keep switching to it.
[181:51.19]Get rid of it.
[181:51.85]Just get rid of it.
[181:52.55]Just get rid of it.
[181:55.43]Alright.
[181:59.24]Get rid of it, man.
[182:01.76]Oh, I'm stuck on a rock.
[182:02.54]I'm like actually stuck right now.
[182:07.84]Get off the rock.

[182:27.44]Whoa, boss.
[182:28.36]Final boss.
[182:31.08]This has to be the final boss, right?
[182:32.46]It has to be.
[182:32.98]Toxic resist.
[182:34.62]I don't have any fucking ammo.
[182:35.91]Play Bloodborne?
[182:36.55]It's one of my favorite games.
[182:55.94]Game sucks.
[182:56.60]Game sucks.
[182:57.24]Game sucks.
[182:57.68]How dare you even pretend to make that joke.
[183:01.64]Retract it.
[183:03.32]Game sucks.
[183:03.76]Game sucks.
[183:04.16]Game sucks.
[183:04.66]Game sucks.
[183:05.12]Game sucks.
[183:05.60]Game sucks.
[183:06.02]No one buy it.
[183:06.62]If you're on the fence about it, don't buy it.
[183:11.14]Well, I can't argue with him.
[183:15.28]Jerma agrees.
[183:18.44]No, I meant to say won't argue with him.
[183:22.72]Can't argue with him.
[183:23.44]It's true.
[183:23.87]Game sucks.
[183:26.49]New weapon, I think.
[183:30.30]I love how there's just one random guy that's always still around.
[183:34.78]After the big fight.
[183:40.72]One sec.
[183:48.03]Arrows for my arrow weapon.
[184:00.76]Boom!
[184:01.62]Boom!
[184:02.96]How come there aren't damage stats?
[184:07.76]Like, honestly.
[184:09.63]How come what?
[184:12.05]Where's the Scotter?
[184:14.03]I don't know.
[184:17.37]Everything's better.
[184:18.21]With the damage stats.
[184:36.93]I skewered him.
[184:39.74]Weird to me how, like, one pack of enemies, each enemy in that pack has different resistances.
[184:49.29]That is true.
[184:51.37]It's like Diablo II would be, oh, here's a pack of, like, lightning immunes.
[184:55.23]What does the purple do?
[184:58.20]Don't even know what that does Souls games are very hard to stream purple.
[185:03.13]I mean I've streamed all Dark Souls 3 and I beat the whole game Besides the like hidden area It's not that I'm against streaming it It's just it's one of those games where you have to concentrate You can't just like dick around.
[185:16.67]Otherwise, you'll just die over and over again So it can be hard to like keep up with chat and stuff Yeah, yeah, yeah
[185:28.48]Another group of dudes on fire down there You know what we're going bombs away can we can we This thing have a beam on him, it's like weird it's like detached for some reason Come here you
[186:03.16]Do you even try and use that sniper?
[186:11.70]Not yet, no.
[186:12.44]There's nothing in it.
[186:13.04]I want to be able to augment it.
[186:22.99]Can we stop fighting balls?
[186:25.17]They just run away.
[186:26.27]They don't do anything.
[186:28.80]This is Warframe and Victivern combined into one game.
[186:33.56]Because Victor Vran had the four enemy types.
[186:36.62]Yeah.
[186:37.42]But it was a fun game.
[186:39.30]It was a really fun game.
[186:41.88]And the actual enemies and shooting and all that just reminds me of Warframe.
[186:54.25]I need a bigger clip size of this thing.
[186:58.22]Yeah, you need a fucking bigger dick size.
[186:59.90]Because one of my things augmented takes the clip down.
[187:04.25]but it should be shooting faster.
[187:05.45]I don't know.
[187:06.41]I don't know if I like it.
[187:08.23]Got him with that one.
[187:10.47]No comeback.
[187:12.31]What comeback?
[187:14.81]Are you making fun of me?
[187:16.63]Hope not.
[187:17.69]Yeah.
[187:17.99]They're like here.
[187:18.86]The enemies are here at our hometown.
[187:28.58]Oh, it's one of those games.
[187:29.84]This guy did it.
[187:31.88]Kill him.
[187:34.00]It was him.
[187:34.54]Look at all these bodies.
[187:39.62]Oh, no, it's definitely Master Smith.
[187:42.14]Master Smith definitely, like, dropped a grenade and ran.
[187:47.29]And Victor Vran.
[187:50.87]Fucking Victor Vran.
[187:55.71]Okay, did we know that there was this, like, spider cavern underneath our town?
[188:00.33]Hidden in, like, the fridge locker?
[188:02.65]Oh, yeah.
[188:03.06]By the way, if you go down in, like, the freezer, just keep going.
[188:05.68]There's a giant undead cavern filled with fucking monsters and balls.
[188:11.18]Monsters and balls?
[188:12.22]Hey, while you're down there, can you give me a couple of frozen patties?
[188:17.15]We need those.
[188:18.65]Get some lettuce, too.
[188:24.43]We can buy somebody from somewhere here?
[188:26.89]We can buy somebody?
[188:28.84]Look at the money bag.
[188:31.70]What?
[188:32.68]There's a money bag right here.
[188:33.80]Somebody is selling something above us.
[188:35.90]Is that like the town or is that somebody in this cavern?
[188:38.88]I don't see what you're talking about.
[188:40.35]But I am strictly opposed to buying someone.
[188:49.15]Money bags.
[188:56.24]Hercules!
[189:01.42]Keep this guy distracted.
[189:05.94]Just kill him.
[189:09.75]Have you found any fortune cookies yet?
[189:13.57]Any fortune cookies that you have?
[189:16.11]Can I have some?
[189:17.35]I don't care about the fortune.
[189:22.89]Where are we?
[189:24.07]I thought we lived here.
[189:25.03]Why don't I know this?
[189:27.32]Why can I not get this?
[189:28.04]Oh, there we go.
[189:28.58]See, this is what I was talking about.
[189:32.50]I guess this is a guy that's still selling things.
[189:38.29]Oh, yeah.
[189:38.79]Oh, it says, find Master Smith and speak with him.
[189:42.87]That's probably Master Smith.
[189:44.49]What is with all these caverns all over the place?
[189:46.90]Around our town?
[189:49.76]Wait, we, like... Wait, this is where he was.
[189:52.98]This is his, like... I remember the Molten Coal reference.
[189:57.30]Wow, you really remember this area?
[189:58.76]Wow, you have such a great memory.
[189:59.75]Yeah, thanks, man.
[190:00.59]I like to see myself as an elephant.
[190:04.25]Never forget.
[190:07.18]This way.
[190:08.28]Oh, we can buy things from you.
[190:10.99]Master Smith is over.
[190:11.95]Oh, hold on.
[190:12.59]I found him.
[190:13.79]He's currently... I don't know.
[190:17.39]I can't... Oh, no.
[190:18.15]I was spending.
[190:20.27]We have to watch.
[190:22.73]No.
[190:22.99]He was sitting down.
[190:26.88]Thanks a lot, Jobby.
[190:28.72]Jobby and Princess... Prince Shenanigans.
[190:31.36]Prince Shenanigans.
[190:32.40]Thanks, you two, for the sub.
[190:33.46]Welcome.
[190:35.82]Take the train to Stormwind.
[190:40.39]She killed him?
[190:42.23]Told you it was you.
[190:43.19]I didn't kill him.
[190:45.01]She did.
[190:46.57]But she's in your head.
[190:48.62]She's in your head too.
[190:50.24]We both had to kill him.
[190:51.48]We both killed him.
[190:53.84]Yeah.
[190:55.56]I got all I need to know.
[191:00.37]Alright, there's a cure in his library.
[191:03.40]Careful what?
[191:04.04]Dying?
[191:05.18]I don't know.
[191:06.02]He's in his library.
[191:07.90]It just looks like someone stabbed him.
[191:10.66]Why don't you guys just... Why don't you guys listen?
[191:14.54]Never listen.
[191:15.16]Alright, here's the magic vial.
[191:24.00]Remember that fetch quest you were talking about?
[191:26.52]Yeah.
[191:27.00]I just did it.
[191:28.69]Congrats.
[191:31.04]There you go.
[191:31.50]Drink the mana potion.
[191:33.44]This is an auspicious moment.
[191:36.72]Dude, did someone like oil him up?
[191:38.86]It's raining.
[191:39.60]You're not that shiny from like rain.
[191:42.40]Someone oiled him up.
[191:44.68]Until you can find a way to administer it to Kamiko's body.
[191:48.17]It will heal her.
[191:49.29]Oh, I see he's dead.
[191:49.95]Then you will need a Chi Bender to reverse the soul-binding...
[191:59.61]Your soul will discorporate and become a wish adrift into ether.
[192:02.86]I don't think you'd like it.
[192:04.30]Oh you mean like I
[192:18.84]Check the main square.
[192:19.82]Please let me talk.
[192:21.78]I wanna be a mom, huh?
[192:24.89]Hate her.
[192:25.31]I hope she dies.
[192:26.01]We're so close.
[192:27.79]We're so close to Leia becoming Diablo.
[192:31.29]Whoa!
[192:33.83]Are we fighting legs?
[192:35.07]That's her.
[192:35.55]That's the girl.
[192:36.03]Oh, right in the forehead.
[192:49.45]Five in a row!
[192:51.45]Five in a row!
[192:54.07]Shit, she blocked it.
[192:58.57]I don't like her.
[193:00.45]Corrupted Kamiko.
[193:06.87]Oh, you wanna know why it's attacking me?
[193:08.17]Why?
[193:08.91]Because I have the higher threat level.
[193:10.39]Because I'm doing more damage.
[193:11.91]I highly doubt that considering that I've gotten so many headshots.
[193:15.24]You don't even know.
[193:24.32]Run away, run away, time for the grenades.
[193:29.97]God damn it, I'm like not good at not getting hit by her.
[193:32.05]You have to jump rope that shit.
[193:36.31]I'm glad that had no bullets.
[193:49.25]Oh, come on.
[193:49.95]I wanted to get the ammo.
[193:55.52]Don't worry, I'm back completely alive with all my ammo.
[193:57.84]I'm fine.
[194:00.86]What is this?
[194:01.30]Necropolis?
[194:02.70]The death penalty does not seem to be very unforgiving.
[194:06.18]Dude, she's immune to powers.
[194:21.43]Don't use any powers.
[194:22.49]Shoot rockets at her, man.
[194:23.49]They do seem to do the most.
[194:28.31]Actually, grenades are better for this, probably.
[194:31.31]Oh, yeah, for sure.
[194:35.87]Oh, that's like some cool portal in the corner.
[194:38.15]I'd recommend you go use the portal.
[194:41.15]That portal?
[194:41.77]Go walk through that portal.
[194:43.46]No, I want to kill the boss.
[194:45.16]Go walk through the portal, trust me.
[194:47.60]You want me to trust you?
[194:48.86]That's the worst thing I could do.
[194:50.60]It'll help us kill the boss faster.
[194:54.18]You appear above our head and you get a takedown attack.
[194:55.64]Oh, here come the enemies.
[194:58.17]Fire immune, ice vulnerable.
[194:59.59]Do you have any ice?
[195:00.13]Yeah.
[195:00.23]Do you have any ice shit?
[195:13.72]This guy's fire vulnerable, isn't he?
[195:17.14]Oh, toxic vulnerable.
[195:18.06]That's right up my alley.
[195:20.08]That's right in my wheelhouse.
[195:32.67]That thing is really annoying.
[195:33.99]I hate having to walk with that.
[195:42.10]God, I'm just walking.
[195:42.86]You wouldn't have to if you just went inside the portal.
[195:45.04]I'm locked.
[195:46.28]I cannot fucking move.
[195:47.40]Holy shit, that was bad.
[195:58.90]Shadow Fury?
[196:01.88]I haven't seen you in so long.
[196:05.11]Okay, I'm like psycho right now.
[196:08.85]Do something about it.
[196:12.39]It's hard to even see.
[196:19.50]We haven't even unlocked all of our basic abilities.
[196:22.32]I thought the game was almost over.
[196:24.08]No, I...
[196:30.19]We have all of our basic abilities.
[196:33.79]Apparently not.
[196:35.29]Hold the line.
[196:40.51]We didn't have, like, ruin the textures on the sky ability.
[196:48.93]Fire the rockets, please.
[196:55.16]He's taking a lot of hits.
[196:57.12]Too many.
[196:57.54]I don't like it.
[196:59.71]I want to supercharge.
[197:08.01]I went right through her legs.
[197:09.23]Stupid jump rope.
[197:10.13]Who wants a jump rope?
[197:11.27]I don't want a jump rope.
[197:24.28]Get rid of the jump rope.
[197:26.62]I'm getting ready.
[197:36.49]Ooh, right in the butt.
[197:41.02]Get rid of the jump rope.
[197:44.84]I really jumped over that.
[197:45.78]I promise.
[197:49.06]Doubt it, doubt it, doubt it.
[197:57.92]Yoink.
[198:02.00]She's so close.
[198:03.48]Don't let her get to phase three.
[198:04.62]Don't let her do the thing where she brings the idiots out.
[198:07.90]Monsters.
[198:10.00]The thing where she stands around and does ballerina poses?
[198:13.37]Yes, yes, that thing.
[198:14.63]Uh-oh, uh-oh, pose.
[198:25.09]She's so close.
[198:35.90]Oh, dropping on you.
[198:36.76]You didn't hit her.
[198:42.53]What?
[198:47.63]Killing blow.
[198:48.21]Killing blow is me.
[198:49.07]I did it.

[202:18.67]They can hear you.
[202:22.77]Hello.
[202:23.35]Who is this lady?
[202:24.05]Is it me you're looking for?
[202:27.03]Get to the lifeboats.
[202:28.03]The stream is sinking.
[202:29.97]Oh, uh, hello.
[202:33.48]Hold tight.
[202:33.88]Hold the shields up.
[202:35.18]Just shut up.
[202:35.78]I'm not saying anything.
[202:36.76]I'm reading my chat.
[202:37.84]Who's talking now?
[202:38.44]Crafting is now... Roll credits.
[202:39.60]Game's over.
[203:05.46]We just unlocked crafting, game's over.
[203:09.60]That was the last cutscene.
[203:11.56]That's for like, playing through it on nightmare mode.
[203:19.07]Yes.
[203:22.72]So how do you get to that menu?
[203:28.70]What menu?
[203:29.61]The crafting menu?
[203:31.87]I was not paying any attention.
[203:34.49]I didn't even notice that we unlocked crafting.
[203:37.01]The one thing that we should have paid attention to that we shouldn't have skipped, we just skipped.
[203:43.32]This is the credits song, guys.
[203:48.06]There is one thing I will need in order to perform the soul joining ritual.
[203:52.61]And that is ancestral chi.
[203:55.23]Ancestral chi.
[203:55.89]Got it.
[203:56.09]Let's get it.
[203:56.39]I'll just pick some up.
[203:59.50]Oh, I'm dropping frames now.
[204:04.38]Dropping a lot of frames.
[204:10.05]Springchester?
[204:11.89]Cool.
[204:12.95]Oh, a real rocket launcher.
[204:14.13]That's a real one.
[204:16.19]That's a real one.
[204:18.76]You alright?
[204:20.80]Hello.
[204:21.02]Hello.
[204:28.87]You know, you're not as stupid as they say.
[204:32.25]She's not going to tell us anything.
[204:34.47]Oh, she'll never tell us anything.
[204:36.47]But she carries something of his wherever she goes.
[204:38.54]I've dropped 2,300 frames.
[204:40.78]Why does she have his?
[204:41.94]He gave it to her to mark her as his favorite.
[204:45.10]It bears his chop, and as far as I can tell, she never parts with it.
[204:48.46]Yeah, defend the modem.
[204:49.02]Somebody get me like a new firewall.
[204:50.38]So this is also a grenade launcher?
[205:15.05]Just go to ChurchStream.
[205:16.17]He's like a way more friendly guy.
[205:18.27]That's not true.
[205:20.62]That is not true.
[205:25.88]Your friendliness is at like a 4% level.
[205:29.58]Why don't you like me?
[205:30.86]Wow.
[205:35.33]That was very whiny.
[205:36.69]It's kind of meant to be.
[205:41.48]Fire upgrades applied to weapons.
[205:43.04]Hell yeah.
[205:44.60]Let's deck something out in fire.
[205:48.63]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[205:50.17]Is that a ability that I constantly use?
[205:53.21]What that is?
[205:56.71]No.
[205:57.51]What's charge shot?
[206:05.46]Powered weapon shot.
[206:08.46]Damage converted to fire.
[206:09.68]What?
[206:11.08]Extra damage is fire.
[206:21.55]Let's turn this into a fire bow.
[206:24.25]What do you say?
[206:30.56]Wait, no!
[206:32.46]What did you do?
[206:36.46]I wanted to use one of my gems.
[206:37.88]I pressed the trash can button on it.
[206:39.46]I just threw it out.
[206:41.84]It was a cool one too.
[206:42.68]It was like, oh, you could drop your weapon as a turret.
[206:44.78]I was like, oh, if I'm using swords, I could just do trash can.
[206:52.13]Trash can.
[206:56.01]Yep.
[206:56.23]I have a lot of good ice things, but I want to do fire.
[207:24.69]What else do I got?
[207:28.49]Oh, stream stay.
[207:31.17]Looks stable.
[207:31.93]It is, but every time I look over at OBS, it gives me a red light and then a yellow light and then a red light.
[207:39.38]And then a yellow light and then a red light.
[207:44.86]Well, here's the thing, right?
[207:46.73]This was the time when it absolutely happens.
[207:49.51]It's trying to happen, but it won't happen.
[207:53.13]You know what I mean?
[207:53.71]Like, it's trying so desperately to, like, drop my stream.
[207:58.02]But it's like, no!
[207:59.34]Not so fast!
[208:01.24]So maybe they did fix something, because this would have dropped.
[208:04.30]I don't know.
[208:10.33]This says fire, right?
[208:18.15]Extra damage is fire.
[208:20.01]Yeah.
[208:21.99]Alright, we, uh...
[208:24.32]toxic.
[208:24.74]I mean, everything doesn't have to be fire.
[208:27.38]But most of them have to be fire.
[208:36.76]Comcast will make you look really dumb.
[208:38.29]Alright, I got money.
[208:44.49]I got cash to spend.
[208:48.05]Oh.
[208:49.23]Alright, confirmed.
[208:49.99]Karma is a bitch.
[208:51.95]Oh, confirmed.
[208:58.04]This is Comcast.
[208:58.92]Stop resisting and end the stream.
[209:01.69]Oh, no.
[209:04.47]Oh, boy.
[209:12.79]Thank you, Ofas.
[209:13.59]Someone modded a song you made into a Dark Souls 2 thing.
[209:16.69]Hold on.
[209:16.99]What is this?
[209:22.35]I wish the bits were coming up.
[209:23.33]I'm sorry if people have been giving them.
[209:24.93]I haven't been able to see them on my...
[209:29.45]my dashboard here on Twitch Alerts.
[209:32.50]Oh, it's called Streamlabs now?
[209:33.90]Fucking idiot.
[209:34.92]Well, whatever.
[209:36.99]Just give in.
[209:38.21]No, I will never give in.
[209:40.97]I will never give in to this.
[209:45.20]I think we're going to take like three quests here.
[209:47.72]If it isn't the poster child for Prozac, we are supposed to be allies.
[209:53.45]We are supposed to be allies.
[209:56.25]It doesn't look like that would be his voice.
[209:58.63]No, it doesn't.
[209:59.61]We are supposed to be allies.
[210:03.85]Let's go.
[210:04.33]Before your stream crashes, can we kill one more monster?
[210:07.13]Alright, let's kill one more monster because it looks like it's really struggling.
[210:11.63]Oh, no.
[210:12.21]Did you run out of adult dice?
[210:15.09]I'll do it.
[210:16.61]Alright, I'll do it.
[210:17.67]Let's go.
[210:21.83]Find the Ancestral Chief.
[210:23.99]How many monsters do you think we can kill before my stream goes down?
[210:26.57]All of them.
[210:28.33]You think so?
[210:30.57]I think it'll pass.
[210:31.59]Oh, see ya.
[210:32.83]Did it really?
[210:36.17]No, the Shadow Warrior crashed.
[210:39.96]Shadow Warrior 2 crashed on me.
[210:42.58]Like, hard crashed.
[210:45.29]Wow.
[210:46.71]See?
[210:47.27]They know the stream's not gonna go down, so they're like, fuck them.
[210:49.97]We'll rip the game from underneath, just like, the rug underneath them.
[210:59.55]And now, like, I'm dropping a bunch of frames.
[211:01.33]Dude, this is a fucking nightmare.
[211:04.15]Games crashing, frames dropping, this is fantastic.
[211:07.27]I mean, you could stop streaming if you want.
[211:12.25]I kind of don't want to stop.
[211:14.93]For one reason.
[211:15.57]The game's fun.
[211:17.15]That's my reason.
[211:19.18]Not just that, but I... It's like really starting to die now.
[211:27.00]I want to see if this like, if it dies.
[211:30.15]It's trying to die, but it won't.
[211:31.97]I want to see what happens here.
[211:34.73]Well, invite me and we'll keep playing.
[211:39.49]Yeah.
[211:41.45]Hey, we're 33.
[211:42.15]Hey, game's over.
[211:43.77]See?
[211:44.39]I told you.
[211:48.31]We're at 33%.
[211:48.61]Just roll those credits, man.
[211:54.31]What?
[211:55.59]That we have, we're 33% through the game.
[211:58.59]How many hours have we played?
[212:00.10]Four.
[212:04.08]That's pretty reasonable.
[212:05.32]That's very reasonable, yeah.
[212:06.76]I think there is some form of, like, endgame-ish repeatable stuff, but I have no idea.
[212:13.81]I wouldn't quote me on literally anything, literally.
[212:21.77]Don't quote me on that.
[212:26.76]Invite me!
[212:27.94]I'm loading into the game, hold on.
[212:28.96]Invite me!
[212:35.62]Chat, give your energy to defeat Comcast.
[212:38.97]Comcast, take me instead.
[212:40.83]Take me instead.
[212:49.35]That guy just got like struck by lightning.
[212:52.36]Yeah, like his life wasn't even enough to stop it.
[212:55.28]Oh god.
[212:58.50]Oh no.
[213:03.46]Don't even fucking tell me.
[213:06.70]So, here's a funny story for you.
[213:09.38]Apparently, everything we just did didn't get saved.
[213:12.30]Somehow.
[213:13.22]We have to kill the lady again.
[213:16.74]Don't ask me why.
[213:18.88]Right?
[213:19.36]Well, if you join my game, I still have to do the tutorial.
[213:27.97]Game progress 2%.
[213:31.27]You know how when they make multiplayer games and you, like, join on someone and you, like, don't get any story progress?
[213:35.84]So, like, my enjoyment of this game is based on whether or not you're online to play with.
[213:40.60]It seriously says... Level 11, 3 hours and 30 minutes played, 2% game progress.
[213:49.72]Oh, that's so funny.
[214:02.62]I have to be online and playing for you to enjoy the game.
[214:06.12]Yeah.
[214:06.64]Or you have to play for four hours.
[214:08.66]If you finish, yeah, pretty much, or just speedrun through it, you can probably do it a little bit faster.
[214:12.57]God.
[214:13.15]But still.
[214:14.37]Wait, what?
[214:17.37]Thank you, Captain Schneider, for eight months.
[214:20.27]Ah, yes.
[214:21.23]Thanks, man.
[214:25.92]Man.
[214:27.30]And now we're dropping even more frames.
[214:31.04]Oh, this could be the end.
[214:31.87]Well, we're pretty far back.
[214:37.11]We are very far back.
[214:40.43]I don't want to turn off the stream, though.
[214:41.37]I say we dash past everything.
[214:42.59]Just, yeah, run past everything.
[214:43.69]I don't want to turn the stream... I want the stream to go off.
[214:46.17]I'm not turning off the stream until it turns off.
[214:48.29]Because I want to see exactly what happens here.
[214:50.13]Wait.
[214:50.41]Are we going to, like, double level up because of this?
[214:53.08]I don't know.
[214:53.94]Like, when we kill the boss, it's going to be like, oh, here's, like, your... We're running Mephisto right now.
[214:58.14]Holy...
[214:59.46]Dude, look at how far behind this is.
[215:01.50]Why did it not save?
[215:02.52]We did so many dialog options.
[215:04.02]We got inside.
[215:04.88]I remember this.
[215:06.03]You didn't think I was going to be able to do this, and I got stuck in the rock.
[215:08.67]I'm stuck in the rocks again.
[215:10.63]This is really horrible.
[215:11.87]We're so far back.
[215:12.61]Why?
[215:12.91]Found a fortune cookie, though.
[215:16.59]Why are we that far back?
[215:17.61]We're doing Mephisto runs, deal with it.
[215:20.21]I'm so annoyed.
[215:21.47]Oh, and we have to do this thing at the end.
[215:25.29]This is so lame.
[215:25.91]Did I see that guy just do like an aerial?
[215:47.75]That guy just did like a cartwheel in front of me.
[215:53.25]Oh by the way, I hope all those guys we just ran by all run over here.
[215:58.21]I would love that.
[215:59.75]That would be hilarious.
[216:01.82]It's like 300 enemies like run at us.
[216:08.92]This was like an hour and a half ago.
[216:13.86]Oh boy.
[216:18.79]I'm just really confused.
[216:19.59]Of all the times to bring us back to, why here?
[216:22.31]I don't know.
[216:22.73]Why did the game not autosave like every single other time it did?
[216:26.59]I'm not even sure you can manually even save in this game.
[216:31.55]No rewind.
[216:33.97]I didn't mean to rewind here.
[216:37.40]Really?
[216:37.66]You're going to go back on your word and rewind?
[216:44.43]Do we have any of the other items we picked up?
[216:47.39]Or is it straight up like we're back at it?
[216:50.17]We still have everything.
[216:53.27]I guess, yeah.
[216:54.14]I upgraded that Press Z ability.
[216:56.44]I upgraded that.
[216:58.28]We aren't even supposed to have that at this point because we haven't done the boss yet.
[217:01.58]As far as I know.
[217:02.38]That's so weird.
[217:03.16]That's what I'm saying.
[217:05.26]We're going to level up from beating the boss a second time.
[217:09.01]And get all those skill points and everything that drop.
[217:10.91]Okay.
[217:11.81]Well, whatever.
[217:16.75]Microsoft PowerPoint stream.
[217:22.00]Oh boy, it's so many frames.
[217:23.78]Oh, we're done.
[217:24.40]It's done.
[217:25.58]Toast.
[217:26.78]It's zapped.
[217:27.42]It's gone.
[217:28.44]It's zapped.
[217:30.02]I'm at zero up right now.
[217:32.62]It's done.
[217:34.04]We done died today.
[217:36.02]It's over.
[217:36.58]We done died today.
[217:37.92]We done died today, you bitches.
[217:42.58]Well, that's all she wrote.
[217:47.62]That's too bad.
[217:48.76]It's too bad that you're in and it's still working enough to be playing the game with me, though.
[217:52.41]I know, right?
[217:53.23]Because otherwise, I wouldn't be able to play this game.
[217:58.77]What time is it?
[218:00.57]9.45 is when it went down.
[218:09.52]That's it.
[218:11.56]What is stopping you from doing streams earlier in the day?
[218:14.24]Just inconvenient, or...
[218:16.90]No, I just... I don't know.
[218:18.18]I have most of my energy at night.
[218:20.82]I'm much more high energy at night than I am in the morning or during the afternoon.
[218:27.29]I'm a child of the moon, Star.
[218:29.58]I understand.
[218:32.86]But, yeah.
[218:34.62]I'm gonna just end the stream.
[218:35.78]Hold on, give me a second.
[218:36.84]We still have to go through the spider cave.
[218:38.93]I know, but let me just turn this off so we don't leave the game.
[218:41.99]You know what I mean?
[218:42.43]Because my internet's dying right now.
[218:43.89]I'm gonna only use as much as I can.
[218:45.57]If you can hear me on my stream, goodnight.
[218:48.15]Sorry.
[218:49.43]I'm gonna say my goodbyes if anyone can even hear me.
[218:52.52]Thanks for coming.
[218:53.14]If you can hear me, goodnight.
[218:54.70]Thanks for all the subs, all the bits.
[218:56.08]I'm gonna sneeze.
[218:57.28]Thanks a lot, guys.
[218:58.30]If you want to continue watching, Star is still technically streaming.
[219:01.60]So...
[219:03.42]Have a good rest of your night, guys.
[219:04.42]I'll see you guys on Monday.
[219:05.32]I'm going to stream Monday just to test to see if it works.
[219:07.99]If you can fucking even hear me, I hope you can.
[219:10.39]But good night, guys.
[219:12.01]Have a good one.
[219:12.89]Much love.
[219:13.93]Take it easy.
