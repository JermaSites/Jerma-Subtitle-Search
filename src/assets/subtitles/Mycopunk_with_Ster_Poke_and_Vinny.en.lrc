[ve:61.1.100]

[00:04.71]Oh, I am back and I am calling.
[00:07.05]See if we get people into the call.
[00:23.40]I'm the only one here.
[00:27.27]I'm the only person here.
[00:29.59]Nobody wants to talk to me.
[00:31.91]I don't know.
[00:32.63]I have no friends anymore.
[00:33.75]Nobody wants to speak to me.
[00:35.75]Hi, Jerm.
[00:36.51]Oh, hey, what's up, dude?
[00:41.32]Hey.
[00:41.54]Hold on.
[00:41.82]I had a salad and I was getting some onions.
[00:43.92]I had some raw onions.
[00:45.37]Hey, what's up, dude?
[00:50.41]Hi.
[00:52.78]Hi.
[00:53.14]Did you enjoy He Is Coming?
[00:55.10]I did.
[00:55.42]The game's awesome.
[00:57.50]That's awesome.
[00:57.98]I'm glad you liked it.
[00:58.96]It's got a very addictive... How long did you play it for?
[01:01.37]like an hour maybe like 45 minutes yeah yeah I think that's like enough time to kind of like figure out what makes it cool I don't know how like long term the game is in terms of like you know like how many hours can you get out of it but it's really good yeah it's kind of got that somebody called it night rain it actually kind of does feel like a weird night rain where this is a there's a boss at the end there's a night the day happens and you have to fight the boss
[01:29.79]I never even considered that, but you're not wrong.
[01:32.65]Man.
[01:34.61]How's Vegas?
[01:36.10]How's it going over there?
[01:36.88]How's the weather?
[01:37.82]Taught.
[01:38.82]Very hot.
[01:41.38]Alright.
[01:42.70]Yeah.
[01:42.82]Kind of what I expected, Jerma.
[01:46.55]It's so funny that when you live... Okay, here's the thing.
[01:48.63]When you live in a place that has extreme weather, it is the easiest thing to just...
[01:55.25]have a talking point on you know what I mean like like you said like hey how's it going over there hey let me tell you hot as hell and you go whoa like how hot is it I'm like 110 degrees the other day and you're like no way it's crazy see yeah it's like the and then we could in like a week from now we could have the same conversation oh yeah absolutely and it would still hit just as hard because you will forget how awful 110 degrees is until I bring it up again oh
[02:25.09]There's genuinely, I know like weather is the easiest topic, but I was going to say like, at least over there, it's not too humid, right?
[02:33.36]Like you don't get humidity.
[02:34.36]You just get dry heat.
[02:35.80]Yeah.
[02:36.10]It's dry that, Hey, by the way, that is part two of every single Vegas weather conversation is, Hey, it's a dry heat though.
[02:44.67]So, you know, when you know it's humid, there's no humidity.
[02:48.80]So a hundred kind of feels more like 85, 90 where you are.
[02:53.78]Yeah, yeah.
[02:54.36]You gambling over there?
[02:56.14]Yeah.
[02:59.07]It's like an oblivion conversation.
[03:01.73]It is.
[03:03.33]You can have the most top level oblivion conversations as a resident of an extreme weather state.
[03:11.34]That's funny.
[03:11.84]It's true.
[03:12.67]Yeah.
[03:13.77]You know, for New York, it's like kind of, it is all over the place.
[03:17.35]We had like a 45 minute monsoon like last week.
[03:20.86]Oh my God.
[03:21.32]And then it just, it just went away.
[03:23.14]But I mean, you lived East coast, you get it.
[03:25.18]Yeah.
[03:25.38]There is one very interesting thing.
[03:27.36]I'm going to show you this image of this foot with tongues on it that they constructed in New York city.
[03:32.59]Okay.
[03:34.57]And, um, I just want to get your opinion on it because I found it in real life.
[03:40.48]Okay.
[03:40.93]and uh here I'll show you so so this is like you know this is what's going on how big is this construction it's about 10 feet it's 10 feet tall okay let me see yeah let's get our assessment I'll put it on stream give me a second it's replacing that image that's funny
[04:12.01]Okay, that's not what it is, guys.
[04:14.55]Hold on.
[04:16.45]Oh.
[04:17.50]Yeah, you got to show the whole thing.
[04:20.24]Yeah, the whole thing has to be shown.
[04:21.66]Alright, so this is a foot with a bunch of tongues and mouths all over it.
[04:26.65]Okay.
[04:27.77]Yeah.
[04:29.13]So, you know, it's like one of those things where, oh, what's going on in New York City?
[04:32.53]I don't know.
[04:32.97]Tongues?
[04:34.72]Okay, why does this look oddly just kind of on its own in a random place?
[04:40.26]Like, where is this?
[04:41.54]So it's on the High Line.
[04:44.33]Do you know what that is?
[04:45.45]No, I don't.
[04:46.99]So that's something, if you're ever in town again, that's pretty much a number one recommendation.
[04:52.38]It was an old elevated railway that they turned into a park.
[04:56.83]Oh.
[04:57.28]a mile and a half on the west side of New York and you just walk and there's like it's really nice there's you know like plants there's trees and then there's also weird art installations that jump scare you that's cool so I I ran into it's awesome I love it there but it's um I ran into that and there's a foot pedal like a bike and if you pedal it'll squirt water out the top of it
[05:21.01]So that's real, yeah.
[05:23.43]Honestly, I'll take that over, you know, every like gray, black and white, you know, McCafe that's now everywhere.
[05:30.10]No, no.
[05:30.79]Yeah, no.
[05:32.13]Bring back the fun shit.
[05:34.09]Do you remember Rock and Roll McDonald's?
[05:35.75]Did you ever have one of those?
[05:38.32]Like at a physical location that was a Rock and Roll McDonald's?
[05:41.52]Yeah, did you ever have one?
[05:42.70]No.
[05:44.38]And we had one on Staten Island.
[05:46.45]It was just, and it turned into the gray McDonald's.
[05:49.55]That's so annoying.
[05:50.69]I talked about this last night, right at the end of my stream, but I want to get your opinion on this too.
[05:55.82]So Ronald McDonald.
[05:58.86]Yeah.
[05:59.18]The timeline shifted when the world started to kind of go crazy and go to shit.
[06:05.05]What was the last time Ronald McDonald had a TV commercial where he was like fun and having fun?
[06:09.30]They got rid of him in like 2014, 2015.
[06:11.52]Yeah.
[06:12.48]Yeah.
[06:13.22]We're on the non-Ronald McDonald timeline.
[06:16.16]You're right.
[06:17.36]You're right.
[06:17.89]What does the timeline look like?
[06:19.87]Because then Harambe and Bowie.
[06:21.77]Yeah.
[06:22.31]Yeah, and then other things, too.
[06:23.59]Yeah, of course.
[06:24.45]No, I think that's an interesting thing.
[06:28.16]And then the microplastics.
[06:29.84]Yeah.
[06:30.32]Like, that happened, too.
[06:31.56]Shit.
[06:32.12]You're right.
[06:33.48]It was because of the clown scare in 2016.
[06:37.73]There was a clown scare.
[06:38.77]Did you know that was on Staten Island, too?
[06:40.75]but like Ronald McDonald oh so there was some scary clowns were around so Ronald McDonald the staple of the staple of American culture we have to get rid of a staple of americana because there was a scary clown in 2016. Ronald McDonald's been around since 1972. that's our culture
[07:02.48]He's actually around a little longer, and he was a... Have you ever seen the first Ronald?
[07:07.45]Oh, yeah.
[07:08.68]Yeah, he's kind of scary.
[07:10.58]His magical tray of burgers that appear every time he puts his fingers down.
[07:15.96]Yeah.
[07:16.91]Yeah, no, he was frightening.
[07:20.23]So they made him cool, and then other clowns got frightening, and they were like, let's get rid of him.
[07:25.32]It's like, what sense does that make?
[07:26.90]You know, the clown community is suffering, and you need good representatives of the clown community, and they had one, and then they were like, no, no, no, no.
[07:35.04]No, no, no.
[07:36.12]So now it's just scary clowns.
[07:38.08]By the way, I heard clowns are coming back.
[07:40.82]A lot of you guys that are younger in the chat, do you think clowns are cool?
[07:46.69]I think some people might think clowns are sexy.
[07:51.98]Okay, whatever.
[07:53.18]Who cares?
[07:54.17]You think clowns are cool?
[07:55.61]I put that into you think clowns cool category.
[07:58.91]Yeah, I think that's one for clowns are cool.
[08:01.42]That'd be plus one in that category, regardless of...
[08:04.99]So yeah, my chat loves clowns.
[08:07.35]Yeah.
[08:08.05]So where's Ronald?
[08:09.78]Clowns are cool.
[08:10.90]Clowns.
[08:11.32]People say clowns are sexy.
[08:13.23]We could have such a cool Ronald.
[08:14.97]Here's one thing.
[08:15.83]Don't bring him back and make him cool, though.
[08:18.52]He better be.
[08:20.16]Why am I acting like they're going to do this?
[08:21.93]I'm just saying if they did do it, bring him back in his old glory.
[08:27.84]I want that jumpsuit.
[08:29.00]I want those big shoes.
[08:30.22]I want him to have a big smile on his face.
[08:31.91]Don't make him cool.
[08:33.29]Don't give him a TikTok account.
[08:34.57]Don't make his reappearance be him doing like a reel with Grimace.
[08:40.34]Oh, my God.
[08:40.76]I would puke.
[08:42.17]Oh, yeah.
[08:42.89]No, I know.
[08:43.33]We don't need Zoom or Grimace.
[08:45.45]no we already had that I remember people drinking the milkshakes and the pretending was like they were getting like I know puke and purple stuff was coming out of their faces I made uh if you remember correctly and I'm kind of sorry I did this but I made a grimace room in our I think the first House Flipper tournament that was the big meme at the time it was so dumb I forgot about that yeah I tried to yeah
[09:09.67]Actually, while we're waiting for Ster, I will show you something in just a second.
[09:14.69]I'm going to grab it.
[09:16.30]I found a Ronald McDonald.
[09:17.52]Did you know he's still kind of around randomly?
[09:19.82]Yeah, I've heard in Asia that he's still there, right?
[09:23.78]In your state, man.
[09:24.81]Your home state, Massachusetts.
[09:27.75]Yeah, I found a Ronald at a rest stop.
[09:31.25]I'll show you.
[09:31.71]Wow.
[09:32.21]Wow.
[09:33.53]just like your ears like perked up I got you I got you I'm going to show you the picture hang on of course leave it to leave it to Boston to leave it to Massachusetts to do this yeah no he's he's around still I found him on the way back from pax um was it pax wait no no I'm sorry it wasn't Massachusetts I lied sorry it uh wait was it yes it was it oh it's not hey Boston's alright it's kind of it's
[09:58.44]It was.
[09:58.86]I'm sorry.
[09:59.30]I got confused.
[10:00.14]I'm an old man here.
[10:02.32]I was.
[10:02.80]So I found... Oh, that is an original Ronald.
[10:09.01]Cool.
[10:09.45]Okay.
[10:10.17]So they have him in a random rest stop in Massachusetts, like near-ish to Boston, like halfway through Boston to Connecticut.
[10:18.73]Cool.
[10:19.22]So yeah, he's there somewhere.
[10:21.08]They just, they just like, they put him in like a little spot and they don't want us to know about him, but you can find him still.
[10:27.14]I mean, I see you here, but is that Ronald on the right?
[10:31.51]Or I see you on the left, but... That's me on the left, right.
[10:37.38]Where are you guys?
[10:40.64]We're waiting for you.
[10:41.44]You're just sitting... Where are you?
[10:44.33]Sorry, I turned my stream on and then left my house.
[10:47.91]Are you, like, IRL streaming?
[10:50.86]Do you have a backpack on?
[10:52.48]Why are you IRL streaming?
[10:55.32]I'm trying to see if I could do this on the steam handheld.
[11:02.07]Oh.
[11:06.11]What do you mean?
[11:06.89]Wait, you're going to stream from it?
[11:08.71]Yeah, I'm on like a bus right now.
[11:11.68]Oh, cool.
[11:12.20]You going to Ronald?
[11:13.02]I'm coming here.
[11:15.22]Let's do it.
[11:15.96]Sir, we were talking about Ronald McDonald.
[11:17.50]Do you have any opinions?
[11:21.95]Stay away from our children.
[11:24.53]See, that's again where you're feeding into the negative clown stereotype when really they're just a bunch of goofy guys.
[11:34.74]Do you know every Ronald McDonald personally?
[11:37.63]Okay, fair point.
[11:39.57]Fair point.
[11:41.22]When there's an infinite amount of Ronald McDonalds, one of them has to be wrong.
[11:48.11]There's not an infinite amount of Ronald McDonalds.
[11:50.74]There is the character.
[11:51.92]Okay, if I dress up in an Elvis costume and I'm like, and I do something wrong, that does not mean that Elvis, the person, you know what I mean?
[12:02.37]We're talking about impersonations.
[12:05.40]The character Ronald McDonald is good.
[12:07.90]But...
[12:09.03]if you leave your kids with Ronald McDonald there is a chance that you left them with the one that is wrong the wrong wrong old wrong old McDonald we're talking about the character we're talking about the character Ronald McDonald oh god I love the way the character was written yeah is to be a charming fun
[12:35.53]Hey, guys, who wants to go play soccer?
[12:39.95]Were you into the whole clown phase the internet had?
[12:44.52]No, we were just talking about that.
[12:45.97]I was very defensive.
[12:48.71]No, no.
[12:50.12]I'm just saying.
[12:50.82]I said no because we were just talking about it.
[12:53.62]Vinny, let him know.
[12:55.64]I'm just saying, you know, we have some clown issues right now, and, like, the Staten Island clowns were a big part of the negative stereotype with the clownage, and, like, you know, of course it's... So when you say we, you're talking about politically within New York City.
[13:09.80]Yeah, yeah, the clowns.
[13:11.20]We're having some clown issues.
[13:12.78]It's a big talking point, yeah.
[13:15.20]No, I'm talking about we actually had clowns, like murder clowns and like horror clowns that were like breaking into people's homes and like, you know, posing with knives.
[13:24.49]But most clowns just want to like go on their way and honk.
[13:28.56]And it's like it feels kind of bad that now every clown has to be like a horror clown.
[13:33.48]Why do clowns wear masks?
[13:35.81]What are they hiding?
[13:37.78]And by masks, you know what I mean.
[13:41.75]Yeah, I guess so.
[13:44.95]Michael Punk?
[13:46.80]Yeah, there's only one clown talking on my stream, and on my stream, gets what I was doing.
[13:53.53]Alright, yeah, Michael Punk, let's go.
[13:56.01]Okay.
[13:57.42]Alright, I'm booting it up.
[13:59.61]Uh, I'm imagining Poke is probably, we got, uh, Poke's probably sleeping, I would imagine.
[14:05.78]Yeah, this is very early Saturday.
[14:07.53]This is early.
[14:10.17]And also it took us a week to decide the time.
[14:14.11]Yeah.
[14:18.98]Life be, uh, kind of unpredictable.
[14:22.23]And then Donkey Kong was like a big factor for like... Is it good?
[14:25.57]You know.
[14:27.15]I love it, Jerma.
[14:28.80]I fucking love it.
[14:29.98]I saw you playing it for a little bit.
[14:31.06]It looked like you were destroying stuff.
[14:33.98]You get really, really into it, and it's just a lot of fun.
[14:37.79]Hold on, I'm changing my pants.
[14:40.43]I didn't need to know that.
[14:42.14]Oh, hey, Vinny, Vinny, Vinny.
[14:43.46]Who's the host?
[14:44.06]Not it.
[14:46.86]I guess I'll host.
[14:47.63]No, Vinny, say not it.
[14:48.47]He's not here.
[14:49.01]Not it.
[14:49.75]Yes, there you go.
[14:51.21]I'm happy to host you little beta pups.
[14:56.36]Yeah, Vinny, not host, not host.
[14:58.77]We did it.
[14:59.74]I almost lost that match.
[15:01.16]You did?
[15:01.48]You know, I almost, I had Jerma help me.
[15:06.73]oh man I like video games I think donkey kong is like Mario Odyssey but with punch and kong and it's really really well done it's just really constantly fun and yeah I really like it the bosses are really easy but the exploration and the collection stuff is fantastic so if you I I don't you don't have a switch too yet right Jerm no not yet I would say
[15:31.89]you know, give it more time unless you really, really want Donkey Kong.
[15:35.51]But like, if you end up getting a Switch 2 in like a year, Donkey Kong is a no brainer.
[15:40.18]So.
[15:40.84]Okay.
[15:41.22]Yeah.
[15:41.90]Yeah.
[15:42.34]It looked fun.
[15:42.92]What you were doing seemed kind of fun.
[15:45.04]Yeah.
[15:49.31]Alright, Ster, how are you doing?
[15:50.71]I'm trying to invite you guys.
[15:51.89]You can keep talking about your fun video games for rich people.
[15:56.62]You know what?
[15:58.72]Jerma played He's Coming today.
[16:00.76]I did, and I was annoyed because I was the third friend that played it after Vinny's recommendation.
[16:08.19]I was hoping I was the first.
[16:10.25]No, yeah, I had played it yesterday.
[16:12.10]You liked it, sir?
[16:14.48]Oh, yeah, I liked it.
[16:15.14]I had seen you play it, I think.
[16:18.63]It's close.
[16:20.37]Okay.
[16:23.78]I thought it was really good.
[16:27.42]I'm not being paid by the coming people, by the way.
[16:29.91]I just really enjoyed it.
[16:33.15]When you guys go to join a lobby, does it ask for a code?
[16:37.24]Let's find out.
[16:40.44]Join.
[16:45.49]Paste lobby code.
[16:47.33]I see.
[16:48.75]Wait.
[16:49.72]I don't know what I just did.
[16:52.20]Hang on one second, guys.
[16:52.98]I'm going to mute for a second.
[16:54.00]Hang on.
[16:57.64]I don't see yours okay there's a paste lobby code that yeah I put the code in Discord
[17:03.94]Where am I supposed to paste this?
[17:05.36]Oh, no.
[17:06.00]Minus one to this game.
[17:07.44]Why?
[17:08.66]My chat knows.
[17:12.01]Oh.
[17:12.19]Hey, my screen is black right now.
[17:13.51]That's... Because video... Because we need to... Can I get everyone... Everyone to agree with me?
[17:19.92]And we need to start a movement.
[17:21.64]And this movement needs to destroy lives.
[17:23.85]And it's that whenever a game... There's like a 50-50 chance if I bind jump to mouse two, it does not... It's like hard-coded to also aim...
[17:34.58]What?
[17:35.69]What do you mean?
[17:36.13]That, like, I changed how to aim.
[17:39.31]Oh, I thought... But they don't expect anyone to do that.
[17:44.74]Okay, that was a weird transition because I thought you were... Because you were mad about the lobby code thing that you were going to talk about.
[17:49.75]Oh, no, no, no.
[17:50.43]All games should have... Streamer mode.
[17:53.35]Like, streamer hidden lobby codes by default.
[17:55.69]And I would agree with you.
[17:56.82]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[17:57.42]But that makes us all look really, like, entitled little assholes.
[18:02.04]Right?
[18:02.46]Like, the streamer community and, like, the video community is probably, like, a tenth of a percent of people actually just playing the game.
[18:09.61]Okay, I revoked the minus one.
[18:10.97]I just bound it wrong.
[18:13.76]It was my fault.
[18:14.50]Okay, there you go.
[18:15.30]But also, these days, like, everyone can stream.
[18:18.00]Like, I think that, you know, like, people are just streaming with their friends.
[18:21.19]So, it's like, they don't need the code hide.
[18:24.35]But, yeah, for us, for us entitled streamers, yeah, it's nice to have that.
[18:30.52]So, um...
[18:33.12]or what you you leaked the first lobby code stalling this whole process I didn't leak anything I didn't leak anything oh I thought you said your chat saw the code no I was talking about jumping oh what oh I'm sorry guys I'm I'm confusing you yeah you're like oh no oh chat saw chat saw it so I'm like okay did you change your pants yet yeah I did it was quick
[19:02.08]Okay, good.
[19:02.86]I did it right in front of my webcam with no underwear.
[19:05.43]But it's fine because the webcam's off, but I trusted it.
[19:09.61]Now that's trust.
[19:11.79]Okay, so where do I put this lobby code?
[19:13.78]I don't see a place.
[19:14.46]It says paste lobby code?
[19:16.32]Yeah, so copy and then click on paste.
[19:18.98]What?
[19:19.65]That is a weird way to do that.
[19:21.47]Yeah, it's really weird.
[19:22.85]It's cool though.
[19:24.43]Okay.
[19:25.77]but actually it does it does show it on screen it does for me yeah um should we back out uh let's see what we can maybe maybe we'll see let's see what kind of trouble we get into um okay well whatever uh so this bruiser scrapper glider I'll choose whoever's available last I took the guy all the way on the left
[19:56.32]So this is like the tank.
[19:59.24]This guy can make... This is like support.
[20:01.04]Instruct a tall pole that allies can grapple to.
[20:07.49]I guess I'll be... I guess the glider is a heal.
[20:10.32]I'll be bruiser or... Yeah, I'll be the tank guy.
[20:16.21]Okay.
[20:16.33]I'll be the yellow frog.
[20:17.43]I like frogs.
[20:18.63]Thanks.
[20:19.79]Okay.
[20:20.73]I'll be the comedy relief.
[20:24.43]Do we get to... Okay, we only have... We have two options for weapons.
[20:27.27]I think that's it.
[20:27.85]Alright, so this is like a shotgun round.
[20:29.06]For now, yeah.
[20:32.28]What just happened?
[20:32.94]Looks like... I don't know.
[20:34.16]That was weird.
[20:37.86]Okay, so this applies fire.
[20:42.63]After these bounce, they do more damage.
[20:46.33]And it's just an SMG.
[20:47.35]Alright, I guess I'm just ready.
[20:51.46]So space... How far is so good?
[20:55.30]Uh, apparently you killed me and it actually might have screwed the whole thing up because now I might be dead permanently.
[21:01.80]Yeah.
[21:03.46]Yeah, I don't... Man, I started that fight and I lost.
[21:09.89]You stood still.
[21:12.85]It was trying to give me the fucking tutorial.
[21:16.70]My game is actually broken.
[21:18.08]Uh... I'll select a mission.
[21:26.06]Repair your broken.
[21:29.38]Ooh.
[21:29.48]Risky.
[21:30.06]I can't even respawn because the tutorial is on the screen!
[21:35.77]Yeah, same.
[21:38.57]You fucked it up.
[21:40.01]I did it.
[21:40.72]I fixed you.
[21:41.30]I so badly wanted just to start shooting you, but I knew what was gonna happen if I did.
[21:45.52]You have to take the head and give it to the pants.
[21:48.89]prepare your broken wait really that's real keys and yeah you when you die you blow up into pants and head let me rebind there's a handy little terminal in the dropbox look sensitivity way down we ain't doing that I hate when this happens I wish they was just doing them all
[22:12.13]Oh, wait, I'm an alien.
[22:13.05]Counter-Strike.
[22:14.13]I used to play Counter-Strike with, like, crazy mouse sensitivity, and then I realized everyone plays it with, like, super low, and now I can only play first-person shooters with really low mouse sensitivity.
[22:25.94]They got a toggle aim, or what the hell?
[22:29.24]Do you fear change?
[22:33.59]I like change sometimes.
[22:36.25]I don't fear it entirely, but if there's anything that doesn't change, it's change.
[22:43.11]That's a cop out.
[22:45.43]I know.
[22:51.54]Sorry, I did like empathy for some reason.
[22:54.88]And what?
[22:57.27]Alright, you guys ready?
[22:59.65]I'm ready.
[23:00.25]Sorry I was late.
[23:02.29]So we can, you can fly?
[23:05.24]We had some good chat.
[23:06.88]Okay, F, I throw up like an energy field, which is a damage deflector.
[23:14.04]F for me, I throw up a pole that you can... Can you guys interact with that pole?
[23:18.91]We'll find out in the game.
[23:20.01]Yeah, I think we can grapple to it.
[23:22.07]Cool.
[23:27.62]Do we have actual ammo?
[23:28.89]I think we do.
[23:29.99]It's not unlimited ammo.
[23:35.16]I was about to just unload this whole clip in your head right before we started the mission.
[23:39.92]So tempting.
[23:41.24]You know he would have been like, what are you doing?
[23:43.95]If there's infinite amount of Jermas, we got the wrong one.
[23:49.57]That's the worst thing you could ever say to a friend.
[23:54.63]That's actually probably the worst thing you could say to anybody.
[23:59.31]That's such a funny thing to say.
[24:00.83]It's not the worst thing to say is that I'm going to unload my gun into your head.
[24:04.38]In the context of Micropunk, the mushroom video game.
[24:09.36]You didn't say in Micropunk.
[24:13.25]Oh, well.
[24:16.57]You were born wrong in Micropunk.
[24:21.54]Okay, don't shoot each other.
[24:25.69]Why are we here?
[24:27.99]We gotta go this way post gifts.
[24:29.92]You can post gifts in the in game chat slash like I have like.
[24:34.28]Like yeah, VRJosh was saying, but it didn't work.
[24:36.68]I tried it.
[24:40.39]Oh my God, that is gonna make me throw up.
[24:42.31]I don't think I want to play this guy.
[24:45.41]I could kill you.
[24:46.23]What happens?
[24:47.25]Oh you OK, you can middle mouse button is to say how cool to cool.
[24:56.56]Clies.
[24:57.90]Clies, look at this.
[25:00.50]Alright, here we go.
[25:03.92]Is my FOV way too high?
[25:06.45]Why do I feel like I'm gonna puke?
[25:12.13]Okay, that's better.
[25:13.69]It's still a little high for me.
[25:15.36]Weird, why?
[25:22.94]Maybe that, okay, I think that's alright.
[25:27.76]I'm going to open this thing.
[25:28.86]Let's go.
[25:30.80]Nice job.
[25:33.29]I'm helpful.
[25:35.53]Is it going to open?
[25:36.71]We got the right Vinny.
[25:39.07]Thanks, man.
[25:42.84]Does this have options to disable screen shake and view bobbing?
[25:46.24]Oh, monsters!
[25:47.80]I had to turn off the head Bob.
[25:49.93]I'm going to get rid of that too.
[25:53.05]Since we're done killing monsters.
[25:57.49]Oh, this came pretty highly recommended.
[26:00.40]So it's like a Deep Rock mixed with Borderlands, I guess.
[26:06.43]Seems kind of fun.
[26:09.98]Yeah.
[26:11.66]Flip that there.
[26:14.83]Flip that there.
[26:21.07]Alright, this is a question for Vinny because I don't know, Ster, you might know what this is.
[26:26.58]Maybe you do.
[26:27.00]This is a question for both of you.
[26:29.67]Do you remember the arcade machine that was the metallic arm sticking out that it was an arm wrestling game?
[26:41.30]uh no I don't remember that no no no wow I mean it sounds vaguely familiar but I I don't I don't really recall were we supposed to go in the hole oh I think we're going I'm in the hole right now I know you're thinking about robo arms I'm I'm anti-clanker there is a sprint button okay I just saw you
[27:05.67]Yeah, like every video game ever invented is since 2006.
[27:08.89]What do you mean?
[27:09.95]There's a sprint button W to move forward.
[27:17.47]What?
[27:17.77]Oh, we know what it is.
[27:20.67]An arm wrestling game.
[27:21.49]You arm wrestled like a silver arm like Terminator.
[27:25.22]You I don't know how the mechanism worked.
[27:27.98]But.
[27:29.41]It, it was, there was a pressurized mechanical arm that you had to arm wrestle and you picked a combatant, right?
[27:38.61]So you pick the first guy's like, oh, I'm like a guy in like a gym shirt and fight me.
[27:43.35]And he's easy.
[27:44.90]But the last, you could pick the last, I think there were like 10 different people to pick.
[27:48.76]One was a wrestler.
[27:49.66]One was, one was a robot.
[27:52.83]And he looked kind of like, he looked kind of like Robocop.
[27:55.77]okay and no this is no it was almost impossible and it hurt to play this I remember you needed to have like three people had to hang on this to actually get it to start to even move but now it sounds cool I don't know that's kind of fun I wonder if they've got got that like a arcade somewhere you know I'm sure they do it was a classic machine I and I want one of these by the way
[28:19.85]There's also, um... Do you know the... There's, like, a strength tester, but you, like, have to squeeze, like, a silver handle?
[28:26.96]Yep.
[28:28.10]Yeah, something like that.
[28:30.00]I know that.
[28:30.82]I don't know the other thing.
[28:31.50]It kind of was, like, a strength tester, but they had some mechanism to make it actually put so much force against you, your arm.
[28:40.23]Oh, that was a love tester.
[28:41.95]Yeah, I guess you're right.
[28:42.79]That's kind of what it was.
[28:43.67]Yeah, it was weird.
[28:45.26]Yeah, I don't know, man.
[28:46.32]I had to...
[28:47.90]I was never really that big on arcades.
[28:50.33]I know that's like blasphemy, being born in the 80s and saying that, but it's kind of true.
[28:55.42]Don't shoot anybody.
[28:57.71]You're supposed to like arcades.
[28:58.43]That's surprising.
[28:59.63]That's surprising, Vinny, considering... Especially with... You talked about, like, Wildwood and stuff.
[29:03.53]Like, what do you do in Wildwood if not go in the arcades 20 years ago before they were all claw machines?
[29:09.14]I do the arcades, but I do the games where you can win tickets so I can end up with a terrible prize.
[29:14.77]That's how I got a Nintendo 64 was purely tickets in Point Pleasant.
[29:19.19]I always thought those were a scam.
[29:21.22]Wow.
[29:23.22]Wait, that wasn't a scam?
[29:25.02]Because isn't it like 300,000 tickets?
[29:27.20]I mean, it is.
[29:29.80]How long did that take you to get that N64?
[29:32.35]I don't know because I was very young and it was like a full family collaboration worth of tickets.
[29:38.39]That was $1,000.
[29:39.69]Yeah, you spend like $2,000 or $3,000 worth of even potentially more to get the $300 unit.
[29:44.42]What do we do about this?
[29:56.61]No, I played some arcade games when I was younger, I did.
[29:59.46]But then, just when you play so many goddamn games, I would rather play the game where you can press the button to get the balls and the cups.
[30:07.83]Like, I can actually get all 50 in that thing.
[30:10.49]And then I win some tickets, and then I buy a cheap keychain.
[30:16.08]The balls and the cups.
[30:17.40]The fun trinkets at the arcade were always cool, but I think they already got you in there.
[30:23.79]Like, here's my hot take about that.
[30:25.07]They already got you in there.
[30:27.63]When I end up going to the prize counter, I shouldn't leave with two mini Tootsie Rolls.
[30:33.32]Do you know what I'm saying?
[30:35.50]That have probably been in the counter for at least three to five years.
[30:40.50]Yeah.
[30:41.65]They had an N64 game in Wildwood called Wetrix on display for, like, a decade.
[30:48.13]And, like, this was, like, well past the N64 era, and it was so expensive, and it was Wetrix.
[30:54.78]Yeah.
[30:55.91]like what do you mean this is the most expensive prize oh man wet tricks yeah it's like a water tetris type game kind of well that's your fault for not selecting uh as your prize the sticky hand that gets covered in dirt within a day oh yeah I've got plenty of those over the years uh Ster funny thing about point pleasant my two first cassettes I ever owned were from point pleasant because I won uh one of those things where you put the money on
[31:24.34]like the you know like a roulette like baby roulette oh yeah and I got nirvana bleach and incesticide those are my two first cassettes and I got them from point pleasant when I was 10. behind the shield so oh god I'm down please assist those are some pretty intense albums for a 10 year old I know I was a little it was a little 10 year old I'm dead
[31:52.04]Okay, well, that difficulty spiked from 2 to 100.
[31:59.04]So my chat's saying get in the shield and throw a grenade.
[32:08.17]Nice.
[32:08.55]Thank you.
[32:13.18]I'll get you, Jerm.
[32:13.76]I'll try.
[32:14.74]I'm getting him.
[32:16.02]Okay, I'll keep distracted then.
[32:19.08]Thank you.
[32:21.15]Shield up.
[32:27.83]where's my health oh god that laser beam just locks right onto you it's kind of crazy no better healing options kill the meatballs well you do regenerate health if you if you hide for a little bit
[32:57.21]Shield up!
[33:05.88]Getting in the drop pod, Deep Rock Galactic style.
[33:12.67]I'm in.
[33:13.77]Can we even kill this thing?
[33:15.29]It's almost dead.
[33:15.65]It looks like it's almost dead.
[33:16.64]We only have like 40 seconds to do it though.
[33:25.15]Hostile is exploding.
[33:27.70]Holy crap.
[33:28.52]Oh my God, that can kill you probably.
[33:35.15]This ship's still counting.
[33:36.39]Why is it still counting down?
[33:38.28]Get in.
[33:39.20]Get in, everybody.
[33:40.50]Get in the pod.
[33:41.44]Do it now.
[33:42.01]Do it now.
[33:43.25]We weren't supposed to kill.
[33:44.19]We were supposed to just get in the pod.
[33:45.59]Oh.
[33:46.39]Well, we didn't get items.
[33:48.39]I'm leveling up my gun.
[33:50.07]Do it now.
[33:50.69]No, no, no.
[33:51.02]Quick.
[33:51.78]Ster.
[33:52.18]We're going to literally lose.
[33:53.86]I'm here.
[33:54.50]He's dead.
[33:55.20]That's Jerma who's dead.
[33:56.40]Oh, okay.
[33:56.62]Let's go then.
[33:57.66]I'm chill.

[35:42.90]They did leave.
[35:43.56]They did leave.
[35:44.06]We'll give him credit for that.
[35:44.94]They did leave.
[35:45.64]They left.

[37:13.22]I unlocked a roll and it literally rolls your camera.
[37:17.90]It rolls the camera?
[37:20.21]Yeah, like a full flip of the screen.

[37:45.53]Hold G for emotes.
[37:49.92]Press purple question mark for more loot.
[37:53.04]I'm going to give the code to Josh so he can join and fill a slot.

[38:54.07]Josh, did you figure out how to post gips?
[39:04.49]Wait, I just... I gotta... Oh, it is...

[39:17.34]That seems kind of... It pulls the first result?
[39:29.62]Huh.
[39:29.72]Nice.
[39:32.46]There it is!
[39:33.14]There's our boy!
[39:35.38]What is he doing?
[39:39.02]I don't know what's happening.
[39:40.20]I don't know what he's doing.
[39:42.04]I don't know what he's doing, but that's our guy right there.
[39:44.88]I don't know what he's doing, but that's our guy right there.
[39:58.72]So how do I, anyone, how do I charge this rifle?
[40:01.04]Does it have to keep shooting it?
[40:02.96]I think when it gets to the end, it'll do a laser.
[40:06.22]I also thought it was going to be a charge rifle.
[40:10.78]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[40:12.70]The stuff I unlocked, chat, do you know how to get any of that?
[40:17.14]Like, I unlocked skins for my character, I think, but I can't figure it out.
[40:22.93]Oh, I think it's under appearances.
[40:24.19]If you go to your gun, and there should be, like, an appearances tab.
[40:28.24]In the gun?
[40:30.32]Oh, there we go.
[40:31.00]Yeah, this costs 25 quarters, whatever it is, to unlock it.
[40:36.81]Okay.
[40:37.85]I want to see what it looks like.
[40:40.97]It's for other characters too, and there's skins for guns.
[40:43.97]Alright.
[40:44.19]How do I close this window?
[40:51.00]I want to see the gun.
[40:55.40]Skins for gun.
[40:57.18]Appearances you didn't unlock a character skin.
[40:58.97]Got it.

[44:03.42]Okay.
[44:03.68]What about the Zabagool?
[44:09.58]I love this feature because you can express so many different things to anybody in the lobby.
[44:14.45]it's a universal language you don't even need to know how to talk yet like babies could play this yeah what is that I typed gift baby because star said babies could play this
[44:41.91]Gorillas, you're just going to leave and you're going to go play Donkey Kong.

[45:13.81]Okay.
[45:14.44]Alright.
[45:15.00]Bugs!
[45:20.50]I can do this and then we can all grapple to it.
[45:23.49]There's the movement deck.
[45:24.95]That's pretty sick.
[45:28.56]Oh, got something.
[45:33.52]We have to kill all enemies.
[45:35.71]We killed 3%.
[45:37.51]Step it up.
[45:40.16]Oh, we got a big one.
[45:41.44]Big lad here in a shield.
[45:42.74]I'm going to throw a grenade into it.
[45:44.89]Grenades up.
[45:45.81]Grenades up.
[45:56.46]Friendly fire, guys.
[45:59.94]Hey, so Ster and Jerma, I have a question.
[46:07.23]Have you heard what... You don't have to name every person in the room before you talk.
[46:13.06]So Ster and Jerma and Josh, listen.
[46:18.49]Growing up, did you ever use the term herb?
[46:21.05]Like if someone was a herb?
[46:24.33]Or was that a New York thing?
[46:26.22]I've never heard that.
[46:27.34]Just someone being like a herb.
[46:30.14]I've never heard it.
[46:31.34]Huh.
[46:31.78]Okay.
[46:32.31]I feel like I've heard it before.
[46:34.33]I've heard it before.
[46:35.55]Okay.
[46:37.91]I don't know if it was used.
[46:38.57]Not a lot of people know that.
[46:40.81]I'm not sure how much it was used.
[46:43.48]Oh, that's kind of cool.
[46:45.22]Here in Staten Island, it was used constantly, especially during the clown incident.
[46:50.68]But no, seriously, it was just a word I heard growing up.
[46:53.12]Oh, the clown incident.
[46:55.41]Yeah.
[46:56.09]I'll not bring up old trauma.
[46:57.99]Oh, that doesn't look so bad.
[47:01.70]I think about those clowns a lot, actually.
[47:03.52]It actually pulled it.
[47:07.17]It pulled the correct thing.
[47:15.98]Oh, I can hold that for a beam.
[47:18.68]That gun's pretty good.
[47:22.79]This is really making me want some Italian sausage.
[47:27.11]I could go for a Sausage and Peppers hero right now.
[47:30.10]Oh, stop it.
[47:30.98]No, don't do that.
[47:31.60]I'm going to end the stream if you do that.
[47:34.70]End the stream.
[47:37.36]That's what an incredible thing to want right now.
[47:40.23]I know.
[47:41.21]Yeah, I love that shit.
[47:42.29]I haven't had one in a while, too.
[47:45.33]It's good to want things.
[47:48.22]Unless those things cause you pain.
[47:54.70]He's landing.
[47:58.10]Is this thing regenerating its limbs?
[48:01.68]It explodes.
[48:02.24]I believe so.
[48:05.02]I don't really know what to do.
[48:13.81]You just got to kill it.
[48:15.57]It's going to explode.
[48:25.72]Yep.
[48:29.35]Josh, you dead?
[48:30.63]Oh, no, no, Josh.
[48:31.37]Sorry.
[48:31.51]Ster, you dead?
[48:32.85]No, we're good.
[48:34.69]You don't have any help, though.
[48:36.00]I'm alive.
[48:45.78]Break it down.
[48:52.05]Someone has to kill these Italian sausages, peppers and onions.
[48:56.98]Oh, man.
[48:58.59]we're all going to get dinner I'm going to have to get that for dinner oh man oh man that sounds so good go to little Italy they got a little Italy in Vegas yeah I know we got some pretty good italian market stuff here you do yeah that's the thing about like Vegas you could just get everything it's not going to be like the kind of stuff you can get but it's okay and I don't know if we probably have talked about this but any good pizza that you found
[49:26.91]not really there's a couple of places that are okay but it's just not it just ain't it just ain't the same here I'm gonna explode same there's also no good pizza around here like how come you can't just make pizza it's the water right
[49:54.87]I watched a video on some dude who was, like, testing that theory, and he basically copied the recipe from Joe's in New York City, and he said that it was, like, really, really close.
[50:07.41]And he used the water from wherever the fuck he was.
[50:09.75]So I think it's more ingredients than specifically water, but I don't know.
[50:14.88]We do have little shrimps in our water.
[50:16.42]Do you know about that?
[50:17.36]I heard about that.
[50:18.10]It's probably the little shrimps, man.
[50:19.34]It just adds that extra flavor or something.
[50:21.59]Yeah, you might be right.
[50:25.08]You guys are lucky.
[50:28.78]Shrimp's kind of a premium.
[50:32.01]Yeah, like New York water drinking, killing shrimps.
[50:37.69]Is that electrical field his?
[50:40.16]Yeah, that's pain.
[50:41.88]I thought that was somebody's shield.
[50:43.96]I think you have to get in there briefly and deal damage and get out kind of thing.
[50:50.45]Unique compromise requesting repair.
[50:54.52]How many shots of blueberry go into the Dunkin' Ice coffee?
[50:57.83]Um... If you're gonna get a medium, I just... whatever they would normally put in it.
[51:02.78]But only do two sugars, though.
[51:04.16]Don't do more than two.
[51:05.72]I don't do... yeah, I do two sugars these days in all my coffee drinks.
[51:10.69]Some people are gonna go wild and do, like, four.
[51:14.15]Too much.
[51:15.38]But you do you.
[51:16.96]Yeah, don't talk to those people.
[51:17.72]I do a medium... I do a medium hot coffee, usually with caramel, and half and half.
[51:22.07]That's, like, my Dunkin' order.
[51:26.05]And whatever the amount of caramel.
[51:29.05]Oh, yeah, there's tons of them.
[51:30.21]They're all over the place.
[51:40.93]It's funny.
[51:41.93]Sometimes I can't tell what is an item on the ground that is good or one of the enemies.
[51:47.47]They all are kind of wobbly.
[51:49.40]Yeah, it's a little hard to figure out.
[51:51.98]I agree.
[51:52.82]Watch out.
[51:53.23]There's a Minecraft enemy.
[51:56.83]Like a besieged creation.
[51:58.75]Oh yeah, that does look like besieged.
[52:01.02]I'm out of ammo.
[52:01.86]I have no more bullets.
[52:04.88]How does one get more bullet?
[52:08.11]Guys, he's immune.
[52:14.81]Some of the readability of what's happening is a little tough.
[52:17.70]I don't know what's going on right now.
[52:22.11]shoot alright do you have to break the whole thing apart and destroy the like the core or something I think that's what you have to do I'm I'm breaking it apart like yeah one thing at a time it seems like it's working it seems like the enemies can just get besieged parts did you play the new one sir uh no I thought about it I didn't play it yeah same
[52:51.43]same yeah yeah it's cool to think about I think about things sometimes yeah I think I don't think I didn't know that was a bomb yeah it looks like they're just like picking up body parts we just gotta be a kill priority here right oh no it's time to go I could have I could have dropped a drop pot I don't know if that matters
[53:20.31]Does it say what it does?
[53:21.79]I... Apparently it's gonna... Yeah, it's how we leave.
[53:29.12]Oh.
[53:29.26]Oh, now... Okay, now we wait.
[53:30.38]Yeah.
[53:31.12]Now we can... We can leave in a minute.
[53:35.63]Probably leveling up these guns though, right?
[53:42.70]Ah.
[53:43.68]I'm getting messed up.
[53:46.21]I feel like this is what... What a machine dreams.
[53:52.29]Yeah.
[53:56.05]But we need to stop them.
[53:57.89]And electric sheep too.
[54:03.90]Oh, it landed like right there.
[54:05.22]Okay.
[54:07.20]It looks like, you know what?
[54:08.82]You know what I think this game is?
[54:10.74]We're white blood cells and we're like fighting viruses.

[67:47.47]Folk, watch this.

[67:50.93]Press E on it.
[67:52.19]You can grapple to it.
[67:53.73]What?
[67:54.73]Pretty sick.
[67:56.86]Oh, I'm spawning monsters.
[68:00.41]This game is fire.
[68:02.43]It's pretty fun.
[68:05.59]We just need to run down this vine.
[68:07.80]The objective is not the monsters.
[68:09.76]Yeah, but we get experience points, don't we?
[68:12.75]I think we get weapon points.
[68:13.59]I'm destroying all the corn pops.
[68:16.85]Bad dude.
[68:25.03]Nice.
[68:26.95]Yeah.
[68:32.98]I lost my car.
[68:33.94]Oh, it's right here.
[68:38.45]Okay, is that 0.10% or is that, that's 10%, right?
[68:46.40]Yeah.
[68:49.74]It's 10%.
[68:54.74]Did you guys get those resources?
[68:56.07]Rare resource on screen or no?
[68:59.14]No, I think that might have been just you.
[69:01.13]Unless we're sharing resources when we get them.
[69:03.39]I don't know.
[69:03.68]Oh, there's a big guy here now.
[69:28.54]Oh, my God.
[69:31.39]Oh, shit.
[69:37.98]I'm clearing the large sack.
[69:41.56]I'm just... Anything that moves, I'm shooting it, honestly.
[69:47.01]I'm moving.
[69:49.02]Well, you better watch out.
[69:56.55]Dude, PTFO.
[69:59.61]What does that mean?
[70:02.64]What does that mean?
[70:03.48]There's a naughty word in there.
[70:05.48]Oh.
[70:06.66]Play the freaking objective.
[70:09.88]Oh, I thought it was like PTO or something.
[70:13.61]No, it's not paid time off.
[70:14.95]It's the opposite.
[70:16.55]Piss the fuck off.
[70:25.41]Fuck.
[70:29.58]Nice work, fellers.
[70:31.34]Woohoo!
[70:34.67]Oh, I have a... You can speak first.
[70:38.99]If you pick up those green orbs, you get extra health.
[70:41.22]They can overstock your health.
[70:42.64]It's really useful.
[70:43.50]Anyway, continue.
[70:44.62]My turn.
[70:46.18]I got the ice cream machine.
[70:49.03]Oh, yeah?
[70:49.95]Did you make something?
[70:50.61]How is it?
[70:51.53]Dude, I'm freaking out over it.
[70:53.41]I can make flurries at home.
[70:56.68]And can you tell the difference?
[70:59.62]No, it tastes better.
[71:00.92]Well, I don't want to be mean to Ronald here because we love this guy, but you know what's in it.
[71:08.49]It's the ingredients you put in.
[71:11.40]And the machine isn't dirty.
[71:13.12]No, it's not.
[71:13.76]It's very clean.
[71:15.20]Oh, mine is.
[71:17.61]I'm telling you, this is going to change the world.
[71:20.88]Yeah, when I first had it, I was just as shocked because all the ice cream makers I've ever had in my life have been absolute garbage.
[71:29.60]It comes out watery and half ice crystals.
[71:33.54]This machine said it makes soft serve, and it's like, you're full of shit.
[71:37.71]No, you cannot do that.
[71:42.18]Well, I got McFlurries at home.
[71:43.44]I'm so tempted.
[71:45.02]I want to make new things.
[71:47.66]Wipe is good.
[71:49.42]You gotta try the Tropical Whip, the Dole Whip.
[71:53.41]The make-believe Dole Whip one.
[71:54.59]It's really good.
[71:56.33]You just freeze pineapples, right?
[71:58.11]You can do that, or you can do... I think it's a chopped up banana, the chopped up pineapple, and then vanilla extract and some of the cream, and it actually makes it... Oh, it's so good.
[72:09.00]Sounds great.
[72:11.67]What do we do with this?
[72:12.53]Oh, we just wait until it works?
[72:15.25]I leveled up.
[72:16.41]I got mats.
[72:18.39]Yeah, it was one of the secondary objectives.
[72:21.72]Oh, nice, nice.
[72:22.58]Yeah, I got to figure out some of that stuff.
[72:29.61]Break the core.
[72:32.88]Gasula stalk?
[72:34.98]Yeah, that's the rare resource I had gotten earlier.
[72:37.14]Oh.
[72:39.30]Oh, I guess everyone can come pick it up.
[72:41.12]That's why you didn't get it.
[72:41.88]Yeah, grab a Gastula stock, everybody.
[72:43.56]Right here.
[72:43.91]Middle click.
[72:44.39]I'm going to middle click.
[72:45.01]Oh, my God.
[72:45.53]There's a diamond.
[72:46.75]There's a gun diamond.
[72:48.31]He comes.
[72:50.17]He does.
[72:53.86]I'm shooting it.
[72:54.52]I'm shooting its guns.
[72:59.25]I'm dead.
[73:03.83]Where's this gear?
[73:05.35]I know I shouldn't care about the gear right now.
[73:06.77]Oh, there we go.
[73:09.19]I think there's a ping.
[73:10.55]I got it.
[73:10.91]I got it.
[73:11.25]I don't know.
[73:13.77]We need to get your pants right and put your pants with your head.
[73:17.13]As long as one person grabs a resource, everyone in the lobby is able to get it from the console and the mission control afterwards.
[73:23.54]Where's his legs?
[73:25.68]It should be a thing on the screen, hopefully.
[73:30.13]Do you get weapon upgrades mid-rate or no?
[73:33.17]Not while you're playing, but then you can upgrade later.
[73:36.73]It's actually a cool system, too.
[73:38.07]It's fun.
[73:38.43]I'll show you.
[73:39.91]When we get into the lobby.
[73:42.06]Labby.
[73:43.06]Don't let him show you.
[73:43.82]He doesn't get it yet.
[73:45.96]I'll show you.
[73:47.74]Yeah, but dude, in that thing, you can do milkshakes too.
[73:50.50]And all you got to do, if you're probably wondering, oh man, like I got to do all this.
[73:55.03]I got to freeze it for a day.
[73:57.67]You don't got, all you got to do is take just store-bought chocolate ice cream, add like a half a cup of milk to it and just put it in, put the milkshake setting on.
[74:07.78]Boom.
[74:09.28]And then all the boys come to your yard.
[74:11.22]I know that song.
[74:15.11]He smiled.
[74:16.15]I think you can use whatever you want, essentially.
[74:31.33]I don't know if that's a good idea or just a bad one.
[74:36.92]I think this is what they were talking about in the Tower of Babel.
[74:43.35]The tower?
[74:44.61]The tower.
[74:45.43]The same one?
[74:47.09]Building too close to God?
[74:48.79]I don't think you're meant to have your own milkshake maker.
[74:55.42]It would be dangerous.
[74:57.24]It is scary.
[74:59.32]I bought years ago a hot dog toaster.
[75:03.18]And it tempted me.
[75:04.96]My hot dog consumption was up like 55%.
[75:08.08]Oh, that's true.
[75:09.84]Yeah, because it looks like I got to justify the purchase.
[75:12.69]Do you eat less hot dogs now, though?
[75:14.09]Because you've had so many.
[75:15.51]Yeah, I stopped using.
[75:16.47]I eat way less now.
[75:17.73]And honestly, I don't even use it anymore.
[75:19.43]Yeah, it balances out.
[75:21.04]It balances out.
[75:22.80]Two of you died.
[75:23.52]Alright, I'm going to be there in a minute.
[75:31.29]I'll get green.
[75:32.11]You gotta get the brownie cookie, the Ben & Jerry's frozen bags of the brownie cookies and mix them in.
[75:36.96]Oh, man.
[75:39.02]I'm gonna gain, like, 10 pounds.
[75:41.59]I have such a sweet tooth, you can't let me right now.
[75:44.29]You could use it.
[75:46.25]No, actually, I... No, I could not.
[75:49.98]I'm back to, like, one... Oh, sweetie, you have to put some meat on those bones.
[75:54.95]Oh, young child.
[75:56.83]Would you like some sweets?
[76:01.72]uh I'm I'm getting up to about 160 now I've that's I gotta slow it down a little to be fair I when I got really sick last year I I lost like 15 pounds I was like 130 132 or something as bad get sick again honestly the shotgun ricochets that's cool what were you you're okay now Jerm I hope so
[76:29.34]Okay.
[76:30.14]Yeah.
[76:30.36]Wait, I'm sorry if it was a bad sickness.
[76:31.80]My bad.
[76:31.98]That's all we can ever hope for.
[76:33.53]No, no, it wasn't.
[76:34.47]A bad sickness?
[76:36.51]It wasn't one of the good ones?
[76:38.56]No, like a cold?
[76:41.32]I don't know what the hell is wrong with me.
[76:42.72]I have politis.
[76:44.89]And I hit like an insane flare up last year.
[76:48.97]Like exactly one year ago today.
[76:52.17]And dude, it fucked me up for like eight months.
[76:55.78]It was awful.
[76:56.34]I kind of remember that actually.
[76:57.56]Like when we were doing our horseman early streams, we kind of like touched on it, but I didn't know.
[77:03.93]Glad you're okay now, generally.
[77:05.45]What's colitis?
[77:07.55]My guts are all fucked up.
[77:10.87]Honestly though, dude, I actually kind of have some digestion stuff too.
[77:17.12]I take a probiotic and I have to be really careful what I eat lately.
[77:21.33]And I'm not.
[77:22.23]He's eating Goblin Glizzies like a motherfucker.
[77:24.42]We're talking about milkshake machines.
[77:25.42]We're talking about ice cream and milkshakes.
[77:27.61]Yeah, Vinny, we are... The temptation is so hard.
[77:33.72]I've been told by doctors and stuff, oh, hey, by the way, what you should do for six to 12 months is go on a low FODMAP diet.
[77:40.96]I'm like, oh, okay, let me look that up.
[77:42.73]It's like, oh, everything that tastes good, everything that gives you any type of gaseous response, anything that has seasoning, you have to eat effectively lettuce and no garlic, no onion, no seasoning.
[77:53.50]It's just like, no.
[77:56.80]And now we come full circle.
[77:59.42]Didn't you talk shit when I said that I wish I could eat pellets?
[78:04.50]Oh yeah, that's right, you also... No, no, I want to eat the garlic.
[78:07.18]I don't want pellets.
[78:08.08]I want to love my garlic.
[78:11.33]I love garlic, yeah.
[78:13.17]Shit.
[78:14.09]Alright.
[78:17.36]Well, you can't.
[78:18.56]I know.
[78:18.84]I've cut back on it a lot, though.
[78:20.50]I really have.
[78:21.19]As much as we're fucking around.
[78:22.37]I have made significant changes.
[78:26.99]drinking a lot less coffee I only drink um one low caffeine coffee drink a day and then I I'm on decaf boys the 40 year old decaf change that happened yeah no it's a you know 40 is a real thing it's not fake so I can't have caffeine in 10 years like seven years not really I would enjoy it while you can I still have my cup of coffee every morning but more than that it's it's a problem but
[78:58.55]Yeah, I think I'll always have that one cup of coffee in the morning, but I used to do... I'd go back to that coffee machine.
[79:06.14]Boom, give me another one.
[79:07.37]Let me say, hey, you know what?
[79:08.11]Give me another one.
[79:09.43]I would have two or three coffees a day.
[79:12.14]At least.
[79:14.23]dude has a coffee maker in his house then he goes over his milkshake maker then he goes to his glizzy maker yeah and he's just on repeat you have to I mean I have to lubricate to get the glizzy down every piece of food has its own maker like every machine it's just like a kitchen of like 40 machines each one with one spec specific thing that it makes you do the line you do it do we herman
[79:37.38]You go to the coffee machine, the machine that makes you the coffee, you drink that, then you go to the ice cream machine, you drink your milkshake, then you go in the next queue, you go to the hot dog machine, and you eat your hot dog, and then you go right into the bathroom machine, and you blow out the toilet bowl.
[79:53.80]That's the routine, man.
[79:55.24]You're the pee maker, you're the poo maker.
[79:57.06]The phrase hot dog machine is a little unholy.
[80:00.61]It was a cheap hot dog machine, too.
[80:02.54]It was really, like, it was, like, 25 bucks.
[80:05.10]And it's just, like, you know what it is?
[80:06.20]It's a toaster with two hot dog-shaped slits on the top.
[80:09.39]That's exactly what I thought it'd be.
[80:10.81]It's exactly that.
[80:11.69]And it has bun, like, spots for the bun, too.
[80:14.84]And, like, my friends would come over and see this thing.
[80:16.76]This is, like, a decade ago.
[80:17.90]And they'd be like, Vin, really?
[80:19.89]I'm like, what?
[80:20.79]They're like, you can just make it.
[80:22.33]Like, you can make it.
[80:23.85]What are you doing?
[80:24.39]You can.
[80:25.53]Like, I don't know.
[80:26.43]See, I'm in a George Foreman grill.
[80:28.54]It replaces that, it makes them better, and you can use it for a million other things.
[80:34.12]Was there any food talk before I joined?
[80:35.74]I hope it's not my fault.
[80:37.99]No, we were talking about McDonald's.
[80:39.53]We talked about Ronald McDonald a lot, yeah.
[80:41.59]Alright, cool.
[80:42.01]Close enough.
[80:44.85]Just making sure.
[80:47.80]I just missed completely, but it's alright.
[80:49.24]Yeah, Poke apologized for making us talk about food.
[80:53.97]Ster, you'd want me to apologize.
[80:55.82]Call me fat every day.
[80:58.10]Damn.
[80:58.60]What the fuck?
[80:59.18]I'm starting to think it's you.
[81:00.26]In the DMs.
[81:04.09]Hey, he doesn't.
[81:04.57]I just made him look weird.
[81:07.02]No, no, I do.
[81:08.04]You can tell him the truth.
[81:09.50]No, no, I do, I do.
[81:10.40]Gotta get the core out of this thing.
[81:13.19]I'm trying to get him to stop eating permanently.
[81:17.06]I've been doing a lot better.
[81:22.61]Do you guys watch Superman?
[81:24.57]No, I keep hearing to go watch it, though.
[81:26.68]Is it good?
[81:27.14]I liked it.
[81:30.28]I thought it was a fun movie.
[81:30.92]You said it's so excited and then your review is like, eh, I liked it.
[81:34.87]Sorry.
[81:35.37]No, but I heard it was really good from some people and then other people were like, it's okay.
[81:40.10]So where do you fall?
[81:40.86]Really good or okay?
[81:41.76]Or is it in between that?
[81:42.58]I think it was a really good movie.
[81:45.47]Oh, shit.
[81:46.78]I think it was very fun.
[81:47.72]It was a good movie.
[81:49.64]The action was really good.
[81:51.18]I like movie.
[81:51.87]Like, you know, sometimes it's nice to just watch a movie.
[81:54.33]You know what I mean?
[81:57.54]Yeah.
[81:57.66]That was so me last night.
[82:01.10]I couldn't sleep.
[82:01.80]I was up at 5 in the morning watching K-Pop Demon Hunters.
[82:05.79]You would.
[82:06.99]Movie.
[82:07.29]You would.
[82:08.70]Who's got the other half of Jerma?
[82:13.03]You guys are nowhere near the objective.
[82:17.32]No.
[82:17.86]Where's the other half of Jerma?
[82:21.57]I don't see it on the... Oh, no.
[82:25.97]I'm gone.
[82:30.96]Somebody said Superman in my eyes was hype moments and aura.
[82:36.47]That's a good description of it.
[82:38.15]Like Siskel and Ebert level review right there.
[82:41.69]Well, you see, I thought that Superman gave me hype moments and aura.
[82:47.45]Yeah, he ate.
[82:48.38]He ate.
[82:49.64]He was farming a lot, for sure.
[82:52.38]I also, I'm going to give him my Blizzy Machine.
[82:55.27]I don't know how to save Jerma.
[82:56.53]If anyone knows where his legs are, please let me know.
[82:58.89]Email me.
[83:00.21]Um, I... Oh, you can order his body.
[83:05.46]You can order it?
[83:06.90]Yeah, I call them in.
[83:08.00]Nice, nice, nice.
[83:12.11]Okay, we got this, we got this.
[83:13.75]You're back.
[83:16.02]Oh, fuck.
[83:17.34]You ordered on Uber Eats?
[83:19.28]Yeah, they just deliver them.
[83:21.81]I referenced that so goddamn much.
[83:24.59]It's everything is like, I'm like, I don't have this.
[83:26.97]It's like, oh, I should, Uber Eats it.
[83:28.56]Dude, I, no, I swear to God, last night I said the same thing.
[83:32.10]You started a thing.
[83:33.04]It's in, you have, that lives rent free, I think, in all of our heads in a good way.
[83:36.61]Yeah, it does.
[83:36.91]It's like the funniest thing I've ever heard.
[83:40.15]I'm glad.
[83:40.67]Thank you.
[83:41.25]Yeah, yeah.
[83:42.69]I can't stop thinking about a Uber Eats to PS5.
[83:45.79]I can't.
[83:46.83]It's like in my head forever.
[83:48.20]It's amazing.
[83:49.00]I wake up thinking about it, dude.
[83:50.18]I'm like, I go, that's funny.
[83:51.98]That's funny.
[83:55.67]Poke, you're naturally very funny.
[83:56.99]You know that?
[83:58.27]Thank you, guys.
[83:59.39]I needed this.
[84:00.61]I just woke up.
[84:02.99]Just stave off the demons.
[84:08.73]The fucking mind sickness.
[84:10.23]I need one a day.
[84:12.71]81%.
[84:14.52]We're doing good.
[84:16.82]I got this.
[84:17.82]All the big growth in the distance there.
[84:22.91]Large gunk.
[84:29.62]What?
[84:29.76]Wait, did I just first try that?
[84:32.04]Maybe.
[84:33.52]Or what?
[84:36.93]Oh, he's got something on him.
[84:43.88]Dude, there's too many things exploding.
[84:47.00]I think we can shoot them in the air.
[84:49.17]Oh, man, am I getting messed up?
[84:50.77]I'm getting mashed.
[84:52.79]What the fuck?
[84:53.46]That way I just get by a nuke.
[84:55.52]It was not a puzzle.
[85:01.65]There's so much going on.
[85:03.53]Yeah, this is crazy.
[85:04.76]We are on, like, a slightly higher difficulty.
[85:07.66]But, yeah, it's nuts.
[85:09.58]just shoot the like this I'm doing damage this yellow gunk right yeah the gunk yeah I'm pretty sure the longer enemies it looks like the longer enemies don't die the more they grow I think that you got it yeah they can use the yellow cores to become other things and use their parts I think
[85:33.09]So what you said in more words.
[85:35.23]Yes.
[85:36.15]No, I didn't get that.
[85:36.79]It was specifically the cores, but you're right.
[85:38.99]I just saw him do it.
[85:40.27]Oh, my God.
[85:40.91]Oh, is it a boss now?
[85:41.92]Oh, shit.
[85:44.08]Throw grenades.
[85:49.89]Oh, my God.
[85:50.95]I can't even see what killed me.
[86:01.02]I'm going to try to get Jerma if I can't.
[86:02.62]Oh!
[86:03.32]Oh, he has missile tentacles!
[86:05.94]Yeah, the missile thing is a one-hit kill, it seems like.
[86:08.24]Yeah, one shot me.
[86:10.86]Alright, I'm... Two of us down.
[86:12.69]I'm gonna try to get you.
[86:14.97]It's funny how you get a view when somebody picks up your head.

[86:22.08]Sturm is back.
[86:22.80]I'll get poke.

[86:28.84]I really like this reviving feature.
[86:31.48]It's very unique.
[86:37.94]Oh, my God.
[86:42.84]Why is it immune to so much stuff?
[86:44.27]Like, I don't know.
[86:45.33]There's there's usually like an immune bot that like beams that.
[86:50.21]We're going to find the immune bot.
[86:51.92]Yeah.
[86:54.86]This guy, I got him.
[87:00.13]My damage is weak.
[87:01.97]Yeah, we need better weapons.
[87:05.40]The dude floating around, he's on the ground.
[87:12.58]Severing.
[87:14.54]Oh, bursting, bursting.
[87:28.22]Big, big, big.
[87:30.45]Yeah, cut his arms off.
[87:33.79]Grenades in those cores do seem to do like damage to every part.
[87:40.91]Oh, he's locked onto me.
[87:42.18]Son of a bitch.
[87:43.94]I'm dead.
[87:44.76]Uh-oh, a lot of shit coming in.
[87:49.43]I'm gonna get you, Vinny.
[87:52.35]Alright, anybody got Vinny's other half?
[87:54.69]His body?

[88:26.66]Yeah.
[88:26.88]I mean, when we all were like, we got each other back when we died.
[88:30.18]It was good.
[88:33.31]I don't think us dying was the good part.
[88:38.29]Get that canister.
[88:38.97]Get that can.
[88:39.43]He's got something.
[88:41.46]Wait.

[89:42.75]Is it for all of us?
[89:45.21]Yeah, we all get in.
[89:58.83]Oh, should have been a ammo.
[90:01.77]Alright, it's here.
[90:02.43]What's it?
[90:03.81]No, it's not.

[90:09.46]Yeah.
[90:15.37]I'm in.
[90:17.19]Give me that.
[90:17.61]It's the wrong side.
[90:18.87]Give me that fucking thing.
[90:21.07]Where's the entrance?
[90:23.00]On the other side.
[90:27.64]Alright, I'm in.
[90:29.26]Nice.
[90:30.41]Wait, I have to go back out.
[90:31.96]No, don't!
[90:33.10]Oh my god, you idiot!

[90:36.90]We just recorded a good run and I was going to use it for my fucking YouTube shi- Whatever, dude.
[90:42.73]I'm sorry.
[90:43.19]Hold on.
[90:43.75]Let's relax.
[90:47.78]I'm annoyed that you did that.
[90:51.00]Man.
[90:57.15]What is that?
[90:59.35]Classic.
[91:02.01]Lethargic.
[91:04.88]I put ice cream machine and it put... That's pretty... Yeah.
[91:10.68]I put ice cream.
[91:14.49]Yeah, hey, by the way, the... That's not ice cream.
[91:18.53]The ninja swirly dude does not come out like that.
[91:21.40]It comes out smooth, firm, and cold.
[91:26.40]And Poke, you can be the one to judge that one, right?
[91:30.53]Yeah, no, I'll make a video.
[91:32.34]Hey, Poke.
[91:33.70]Yeah.
[91:34.44]This console over here, you want to touch this and get your materials when you get a chance.
[91:43.59]Stop talking.
[91:44.25]Why?
[91:44.55]Did I say something gross?
[91:51.72]Swarm launcher requires level two.
[91:54.67]This right here?
[91:56.57]Yeah.
[91:58.47]Get some materials for that.
[92:01.70]Oh yeah.
[92:03.34]Oh my god.
[92:04.06]You just screamed!
[92:04.86]Fuck, what just happened?
[92:05.57]Why am I dead?
[92:06.35]I don't- I didn't know that you could hurt each other in the zone.
[92:09.63]I don't get you, I'm sorry.
[92:10.61]I just was angry about, uh, my- I didn't get a purple, so I was doing the thing right.
[92:15.70]I didn't get a purple, I'm mad.
[92:22.23]Bennett, you're genuine, like, the fuck just happened?
[92:25.55]I just- it happened.
[92:27.01]It came out of nowhere.
[92:29.62]Okay, let's upgrade.
[92:31.91]Ammo capacity increase.
[92:42.50]Upgrade grid enlarged.
[92:48.08]When you upgrade your weapon, it enlarges the grid.
[92:54.25]Yes.
[92:55.87]I see.
[92:56.59]Ooh.
[92:57.42]See what you've done Germany.
[93:00.61]Holy shit.
[93:01.35]I got a legendary.
[93:04.61]But weren't you just complaining you didn't get an epic or something?
[93:07.09]I got this a long time ago.
[93:08.05]I just haven't gone to the menu.
[93:10.70]Some of it you can't unlock until you get more stuff.
[93:14.58]Oh shit.
[93:15.06]This makes the laser shitty though.
[93:22.75]Is that better?
[93:23.29]It might be better.
[93:23.97]Neat.
[93:32.45]Rhombus times three.
[93:34.78]A rare fungus that occasionally grows on enemy shells.
[93:38.42]What about like a different weapon or something?
[93:46.84]This thing's fine.
[93:48.40]He sounds like he's talking to me in Animal Crossing.
[93:57.83]I'm gonna save my materials.
[94:05.43]That's fine.
[94:13.36]Wait, my dude is good at... What is he good at?
[94:20.51]You know, I create that thing.
[94:23.81]Does no one else have a jetpack?
[94:25.05]Am I the only one else with a jetpack?
[94:27.05]I think you have a jetpack.
[94:28.20]By the way, can somebody in the chat help me?
[94:30.86]What is that first ability that I'm not using?
[94:33.74]What is that?
[94:36.21]it's just is it grenade can you not okay press tab and read your abilities uh it's the brain damage I don't it's not uh and it's not listed here that's what I'm that's why I was confused you dumb ass what did you say
[95:10.63]What did you say to me?
[95:11.51]I think my only death so far may have been like Jerma killing me in mission, so it's fair.
[95:18.22]I haven't done any friendly fire kills at all, actually.
[95:20.37]I saved your ass at least two or three times.
[95:27.33]I don't know about that.
[95:28.14]I'm ready.
[95:30.54]I am almost ready.
[95:32.94]You can when you level up, but you have to kind of like buy them with materials.
[95:39.56]Oh, it wasn't like a... In your menu?
[95:41.62]I got an option.
[95:43.34]Like pick one.
[95:45.08]Oh yeah, then you can buy the other one later.
[95:46.92]So you get like one, I think, for free at an upgrade.
[95:50.11]That is not the product I was looking for.
[95:52.55]Hold reload to convert all power stacks into overflow ammo.
[96:01.76]You know, I'm just going to unlock this.
[96:04.48]This seems interesting.
[96:05.60]Do this one?
[96:06.36]What is this one?
[96:14.93]That's a funny one.
[96:18.31]Looking at pictures of yourself.
[96:27.48]OK, I'll be right back.
[96:28.39]You can start whenever I'll be right back.
[96:32.41]What's this problem?
[96:38.26]My chat told me to do that.
[96:39.56]I just listened.
[96:40.44]What's your problem?
[96:44.73]Is it pouring over here?
[96:48.55]Are you ready?
[96:49.03]I'm going to pull you to the ship.
[96:52.42]I'm ready, yeah.
[97:05.13]Am I dead?
[97:07.73]I don't know.
[97:08.17]Is he?
[97:08.83]No, he's not, right?
[97:09.63]You're not allowed on the mission now.
[97:11.26]What?
[97:13.15]No, he's going to come with us, right?
[97:15.63]No, I'm here.
[97:20.07]I'm under the ship.
[97:22.30]I'm here.
[97:24.50]Hey, there we go.
[97:33.53]Gear locked.
[97:36.45]That's fine with me.
[97:42.83]Alright.
[97:43.67]Activate barrel repository.
[97:48.23]What the fuck was that?
[97:55.04]Ow.
[97:58.89]Oh, you do take fall damage.
[98:03.35]Yeah.
[98:05.27]I was thinking we were immune because we were Michael Punk.
[98:09.46]What the heck?
[98:10.94]Michael Punk?
[98:12.41]Like, yeah, Daft Punk's brother.
[98:21.28]Look at how huge that thing is.
[98:23.58]Hey, Polk, have you played He Is Coming?
[98:26.79]No.
[98:29.69]This is the game.
[98:33.91]It's great.
[98:35.90]I saw Vinny link it to Ster, right?
[98:40.05]yeah and then Ster played it and then Jerma played it and now it's like a mind virus where you just have to ask everyone if they played he is coming should I guys this is really far away you should get in the car oh that's right four and summon car wait can it come through the ceiling yes yo don't call me yes this is this is really far hold four and summon car
[99:16.62]This is pretty far.
[99:18.26]Sick.
[99:22.39]So my car got stuck.
[99:37.86]Sort barrels.
[99:43.30]Alright, we have to roll barrels into their respective holes.
[99:48.18]Wait, if you touch them, they blow up.
[99:51.25]Where are the holes?
[99:54.59]How do you roll it?
[99:57.27]What are these question marks over here?
[99:58.75]There's a bunch of question marks.
[100:00.81]It says self-destruct.
[100:06.02]Are you still that far away?
[100:11.16]Yeah, it was really far.
[100:17.50]Okay.
[100:20.17]Okay, you almost killed me.
[100:22.09]I didn't even come close to you.
[100:24.96]You hit the barrel.
[100:26.16]These barrels explode.
[100:28.38]They are the objective.
[100:29.14]You drove your car through it.
[100:31.23]Why are you lying?
[100:32.17]I didn't.
[100:34.49]No, go ahead.
[100:36.42]I was just getting out of the car.
[100:37.90]I wasn't trying to kill anybody.
[100:40.52]Yeah, but you lied and you said that you didn't.
[100:43.78]I don't know how to move it.
[100:45.10]I think we have to punch it.
[100:46.88]Oh, God.
[100:48.53]Yeah, it blows up.
[100:50.17]Oh, it might have been you, Poke.
[100:51.65]Alright, so where's the place we have to deposit over here?
[100:54.13]Activates challenge leaves.
[100:55.72]Oh, that's what that was?
[100:56.88]I can carry it.
[101:00.04]Oh, my God.
[101:00.76]What do we do with this?
[101:03.69]We have to roll it all the way to the symbols, I think.
[101:07.86]And we have to go revive Vinny, who never showed up.
[101:12.08]I activated a challenge and then immediately died.
[101:14.60]It was fun.
[101:17.26]Objective failed.
[101:18.16]Oh, it's right there.
[101:20.23]I don't know where my car is.
[101:25.85]Alright.
[101:31.06]Wait, green.
[101:31.72]Do I have to match green to green?
[101:36.44]Thank you.
[101:41.47]Yep.
[101:42.15]Alright, one's going in.
[101:44.93]Okay, just need the fuel one.
[101:54.65]Watch out, it's going to explode next to your poke.
[102:04.58]Uh, I'll get the other barrel.
[102:06.08]Oh, my ping and melee are the same button.
[102:14.47]I think I self-destructed a barrel.
[102:16.43]Why is that an option?
[102:17.95]Do we know why?
[102:19.81]I think you have to go to the handle and hit carry.
[102:25.20]Okay, I got this one.
[102:25.98]Someone's going to get an achievement getting this in one go, right?
[102:46.88]I just threw a grenade at a plant because I thought it was an enemy.
[102:51.01]Get away from this.
[102:51.61]I believe if the cores are exposed, even on the really big enemies, if you punch them, they just instantly die.
[102:57.26]Get in there.
[103:00.28]Alright, I got it.
[103:02.17]Well, thank God I did it because I just died.
[103:05.65]Wait, wait, did you get in the grinder?
[103:07.97]There were enemies attacking me, but I think I got double killed by the grinder and the enemy.
[103:13.24]I got you.
[103:15.60]We need another one?
[103:22.03]I'll get it.
[103:31.07]Oh!
[103:46.62]Wait, so chat, I upgraded my gun to have this thing.
[103:52.75]What is happening?
[103:53.43]No barrel?
[103:58.18]I have a barrel.
[103:59.24]Oh, you have it.
[104:02.35]Oh, I have to.
[104:03.17]Okay, I have to throw the grenade first and then I can get power from them.
[104:10.22]I think.
[104:12.51]hold reload I've been it's not really doing anything is that do we stick it in the grinder you put it in the green grinder well then you're going in the grinder music's good music is pretty good you need more debuffs okay take a sip of my delicious decaf coffee yep yep cargo pod is on its way
[104:45.28]flip the truck yeah I have a wrench now I think we gotta hit this hit the truck with it maybe oh to fix the truck oh
[105:18.64]What the?
[105:19.36]Excuse me.
[105:20.04]You can grapple up here if you want to.
[105:23.00]I put a grapple point kind of amazing that even works, but.
[105:31.51]How much damage you get?
[105:33.01]It turns you.
[105:34.13]Oh boy.
[105:36.25]Yeah.
[105:39.54]You want the tires to be green?
[105:43.22]No, I'll take care of the truck.
[105:45.08]You guys deal with the monsters.
[105:48.16]OK.
[105:48.95]The truck is full.
[105:51.25]I'm accompanying it, that's why.
[105:53.11]Wait, how do you get more ammo in this game?
[106:03.31]I think it's on the ground.
[106:05.19]Just like the random pickups that they drop must be ammo.
[106:21.35]It regens damaging with your other gun.
[106:26.08]You get ammo by using your other weapon.
[106:28.46]Oh, that's interesting.
[106:32.67]Ah.
[106:34.93]Ah, weird.
[106:35.79]Ah.
[106:36.46]Ah.
[106:37.38]Get this guy the fuck out of here.
[106:51.20]There's a bomb coming in.
[107:04.09]Oops.
[107:07.38]Uh-oh.
[107:09.74]Is Dubai Chocolate like the new meme?
[107:12.70]I think so, yeah.
[107:16.69]Correct me if I'm wrong.
[107:17.41]This is the meme, right?
[107:19.13]This is the new meme.
[107:20.03]They say...
[107:21.30]Dubai Chocolate Labubu something.
[107:23.73]Yeah.
[107:24.87]Oh, it's the new Skibidi Riz.
[107:27.49]It's Labubu Dubai Chocolate Chatter is, I think, the new thing.
[107:32.84]I don't know what any of that means.
[107:34.14]I don't know.
[107:34.80]I have no idea where it came from.
[107:36.56]Those words are in the Bible.
[107:39.06]They are.
[107:39.55]I think it's somebody made the name and they got a bunch of laughs from different Twitches and stuff.
[107:46.53]I think that's what it is.
[107:48.02]Dubai Chocolate is...
[107:49.79]We talked about this.
[107:51.73]Yeah, we did.
[107:52.25]I still haven't had it, but I see it every time I'm, like, at a mall, which is weirdly more often than you would expect.
[107:58.40]But, like, multiple stores have Dubai chocolate.
[108:01.04]I'm like, what is this?
[108:01.72]I feel like you see it at farmer's markets and stuff all the time, too.
[108:05.69]Dude, malls get a bad rep.
[108:08.97]I like malls.
[108:10.26]They're fun.
[108:10.92]They're fun to hang in.
[108:11.96]I love malls.
[108:14.46]Yeah, they get a bad rep because they're, like, outdated at this point.
[108:18.19]It's all going to come back around.
[108:19.99]Because you just buy everything on Amazon.
[108:21.83]I think people are getting sick of that.
[108:23.70]Well, now malls have aquariums in them.
[108:29.18]Yeah, people need a third place.
[108:30.56]Did you ever hear about that?
[108:31.32]The third place.
[108:32.25]Yeah, that's true.
[108:34.69]It's absolutely true.
[108:36.13]A third place.
[108:36.81]Work, home, and then the strip club.
[108:40.98]The third space became a lot of online spaces.
[108:44.36]Yeah, seriously.
[108:45.50]Yeah.
[108:47.28]mmos or like just people get like when I was younger in Germany you might relate to this Team Fortress classic was my third space yeah exactly honestly a lot of people would argue that what we're doing right now has become the one a digital third space yeah
[109:07.36]watching movies on Discord yeah the Discord people getting in a group of Discord watching movies um watching streams streaming in general I feel like has taken that over in a lot of ways I have friends that would and you know people like viewers that enjoy my stuff they would watch it together in VR yeah and it's like that's cool if you're enjoying it you can like look at each other in virtual reality like and you know talk about what's going on that's kind of fun
[109:34.55]I will say, I do think for the health and the well-being of us all, I do think that only digital third spaces is bad.
[109:45.61]Yeah, yes, I agree.
[109:46.85]I like real life a lot, so yeah.
[109:52.16]Yeah, sometimes.
[109:54.82]It's just nice to have a place to go where you can hang or just relax.
[109:58.54]I have my spots that I, you know... Even if I'm not there for long, it's just nice to get out of the house for a little bit and go get something to eat or something.
[110:09.46]Yeah.
[110:09.58]Makes you appreciate the computer more.
[110:12.20]It kinda does.
[110:12.74]I need the house just so I can like my computer more.
[110:15.63]Yeah, honestly.
[110:17.15]Remind me why I don't go out.
[110:21.21]I mean, why would you ever go out when you have the ice cream maker at home?
[110:25.00]Oh, he's been poisoned.
[110:44.31]I might die.
[110:46.55]This creature is large.
[110:48.59]He is.
[110:55.50]interesting placement yeah I don't know why I did that you guys with 3D printers I thought they were interesting but I would like to one day you got one I I thought that technology was gonna like be bigger
[111:19.81]It's getting better.
[111:21.00]People are using weird 3D printed materials to make houses now and shit.
[111:25.51]It's already quite good.
[111:27.29]I thought that was going to be the next thing, but then everyone was like, I don't know, talking to my computer and it's saying funny things is the new thing.
[111:34.95]Or like, yeah, yeah, anime girls that can talk propaganda.
[111:41.23]Oh, you can make literally anything you can conceive of?
[111:44.43]What if, like, it spread propaganda, though?
[111:50.98]Pretty much.
[111:53.45]Pretty much.
[111:56.51]Can you 3D print propaganda?
[111:59.06]I don't think... I mean, yeah.
[112:01.54]You could, but you'd have to put it up a bunch of places.
[112:05.99]Yeah.
[112:07.45]No, I've seen, like, people have given me cool 3D printed things, like, at conventions that they've made, and I'm like, oh, that's cool.
[112:15.75]Like, what else do you do with this?
[112:16.87]They're like, no, just this.
[112:18.91]That does seem to be the use case of, like, funny little quirky thing.
[112:23.62]Like, I took a 3D scan of your entire body, and here's a 3D print of it.
[112:28.27]And I'm like, oh, thanks.
[112:31.97]Hey, could I get one of those?
[112:34.54]life size?
[112:35.28]No, I'm sorry.
[112:36.52]Those are very exclusive.
[112:40.74]I'll get you a gray Leno plush.
[112:43.55]Ooh.
[112:46.31]When can you get one of those?
[112:48.59]Oh, I don't know.
[112:51.49]My worst character and the company that I worked with for a while, they were like, we want to make a gray Leno plushie.
[112:58.98]I'm like, that's not going to sell.
[113:02.10]Yeah.
[113:04.63]and and let me guess it is it's doing okay oh yeah it's fine it did well it didn't do like gangbusters but I don't really care it's just some dumb thing that you could put kerosene on and light on fire that sounds dangerous that seems that seems bad for the environment all around I died I'm confused this mission I'll be honest
[113:33.97]I'm just killing things.
[113:34.85]We're just defending.
[113:36.42]And we have, like, turrets we can use.
[113:40.26]Oh, I need help.
[113:42.41]I think we got multiple people dead.
[113:43.37]Oh, I died.
[113:43.99]Ster, it's just you.
[113:45.74]Ster, if he dies, it's all over.
[113:47.94]Okay, well... Ster, please live.
[113:58.47]Official Fartbutt in my chat says, Gray Leno is your dumbest bit, and it's not particularly high bar.
[114:03.82]Thank you, Official Fartbutt.
[114:05.18]I appreciate your input.
[114:08.09]I can't spectate.
[114:10.87]Yeah.
[114:12.44]Ooh.
[114:13.02]I put Tarkov, and I put the Burnt Peanut.
[114:14.74]That's crazy.
[114:17.56]I don't know.
[114:18.03]There's so many on the side of my screen, I didn't notice any of them.
[114:20.53]I'm locked in.
[114:21.87]Why did I spawn down here?
[114:23.41]Where the hell am I?
[114:26.01]But Summit 1G.
[114:28.40]That's funny.
[114:35.20]Yes, you got me back.
[114:36.00]Nice.
[114:41.11]Why am I this far away?
[114:42.55]I don't know.
[114:54.36]I'm dead again.
[114:55.51]Oh, I'm alive.
[114:58.49]I tried jumping in one of those turrets, and it just got me killed.
[115:01.18]I'm going to try to get you, Vinny.
[115:03.16]Sorry about that.
[115:10.41]Okay, where's your... There it is.
[115:11.49]Poke, are you alive?
[115:17.88]Yeah.
[115:18.42]Okay, good.
[115:24.74]There's some gaming going on over here.
[115:27.54]Sounds like it.
[115:28.84]Wasn't me.
[115:33.31]Break that core.
[115:38.26]His core is exposed.
[115:40.06]Hit that Michael Punk.
[115:41.96]Michael.
[115:43.62]No.
[115:45.65]Die.
[115:47.97]Me and Michael.
[115:50.61]Solid as they come.
[115:58.78]No, please.
[116:04.26]I need health.
[116:17.10]So many fucking enemies on screen right now.
[116:20.42]Do we get stats at the end?
[116:21.58]Is this a real game?
[116:24.33]Yeah, they show you some stats, I think.
[116:28.19]Pod's coming in in one minute.
[116:36.60]Oh!
[116:40.78]Little janky, that.
[116:49.71]Did I hit myself with my own poison?
[116:56.12]You may have.
[117:03.29]I'm doing work down here.
[117:04.65]Damn, I'm gonna have to save all that shield.
[117:19.63]He's immune.
[117:20.63]Where's the immunity bot?
[117:21.53]There it is.
[117:21.87]I wanna use the turrets.
[117:28.38]I'm dead!
[117:34.73]I'm running for you.
[117:36.81]Whoa, there's a lot of enemies over here.
[117:38.49]Holy shit.
[117:39.47]The drop pod is very dangerous.
[117:41.57]Be very careful coming back to it.
[117:45.94]50 seconds.
[117:48.38]I got him.
[117:53.79]Oh, clutch.
[117:55.63]I'm in.
[117:57.59]Oh yeah, that's... I keep thinking they're a resource.
[118:01.49]Oh, it's glitching through the fucking wall.
[118:06.49]Should I launch it?
[118:08.17]I think we're ready to launch.
[118:10.33]Whoa, fellas.
[118:12.51]Wait, I left something down there.
[118:18.00]I don't want points.
[118:20.34]Did you do it again?
[118:29.53]Okay, no.
[118:30.13]I was going to say, did you fucking do it again?
[118:32.41]Oh, level four, yeah.
[118:35.19]That was a big one.
[118:37.81]That was a real big one.
[118:45.09]Okay, then.
[118:47.93]Oh, it just shows damage and... Oh, it's one of these.
[118:49.90]It's like GoldenEye.
[118:51.20]I got three deaths.
[118:52.08]Wow, I'm very proud of myself.
[118:53.14]Oh, fuck, you got ignited.
[118:53.94]What happened?
[118:56.12]You got ignited four times.
[118:58.42]Double lasso wrangler upgrade.
[119:02.49]I'm not a wrangler, though.
[119:06.55]Show me the logs.
[119:09.40]Let me inspect your logs.
[119:14.14]I didn't get one of these resources?
[119:16.59]What the hell?
[119:20.09]I think we have to go on specific missions for said logs.
[119:23.20]Resources.
[119:24.48]Yeah.
[119:28.92]That is true.
[119:32.15]They're at the unction getting turnt.
[119:35.29]Was that words?
[119:36.71]Oh, right, unction.
[119:38.14]That's right, yeah.
[119:42.81]I could level up now.
[119:50.32]Yeah, I bet you could.
[119:53.04]Yes, I bet you have.
[119:55.42]What's that from?
[119:56.02]What movie is that from?
[119:59.79]Minions.
[120:00.95]No, not Minions.
[120:02.03]He goes, yes, I'll bet you have.
[120:04.65]And then he shoots.
[120:07.51]Minions.
[120:10.28]Minions 2.
[120:10.92]1977 film.
[120:13.72]Close.
[120:18.55]I don't know.
[120:20.67]Star Wars Han Solo.
[120:22.29]Fuck, I was going to say Under the Table shoots him.
[120:24.83]That's insane.
[120:26.88]McClunky, yeah.
[120:28.16]I'm so annoyed.
[120:29.00]I thought it was so wrong that I didn't even want to say it.
[120:32.78]It's annoying.
[120:34.17]Yeah.
[120:40.64]Didn't they re-edit that scene like five different times?
[120:44.72]About three times, yeah.
[120:45.77]There's a DVD release or a Blu-ray release where they edited it again where they shoot at the same time.
[120:54.64]Because George Lucas was like, alright, I guess that'll fix it.
[121:01.39]Oh.
[121:10.37]I need green wrenches.
[121:13.54]I need the green stuff too.
[121:15.40]I need green.
[121:16.40]Let's get green.
[121:17.74]Let's get green.
[121:20.94]We need that green shit.
[121:26.51]All my grenades need green.
[121:34.00]That's what make it better.
[121:39.36]Also, if you didn't notice in the storage, you get those tokens that guarantee the things you pick up are for you.
[121:50.00]What does that mean?
[121:53.36]You can get upgrade drops for the characters you're not playing.
[121:57.36]Oh, I see.
[121:58.54]I got double resources for my next mission.
[122:01.87]Oh my.
[122:02.25]Wait, how did you do that?
[122:04.21]Bootleg replicator.
[122:06.97]Why Ster mad?
[122:08.73]Because he got double.
[122:10.09]I didn't get double.
[122:11.25]What did you do with that?
[122:12.53]I want to see how you did that.
[122:13.99]It was in storage.
[122:14.51]I had my last item.
[122:15.62]It was in storage?
[122:20.84]Ooh.
[122:24.27]I'm turning that one on.
[122:31.80]Alright.
[122:36.11]Is this a green mission?
[122:39.02]yeah everyone understood the shot first thing it's like it's immoral or what because heroes should always be shot oh no heroes should always be good I don't know why I thought that person was saying here should be shot first I read that wrong
[123:04.73]it's like well the point of Han Solo is that he's supposed to be like a rogue who grows into a you know nicer guy later right and like grito was sent by jabba so you know it's part of his character still a hero he just has to become one can we get a gift for each one of these so we understand what you're talking about what is what is that my funky
[123:36.53]Whoa.
[123:38.79]I'm in my car.
[123:39.41]I'm driving to objective.
[123:46.56]Jerma died already.
[123:49.02]The fuck?
[123:56.19]Just saying.
[123:57.76]That's going on your record in your post stream stats.
[124:00.70]I don't care.
[124:02.08]See if I care.
[124:04.13]Sounds like he cares.
[124:06.00]It sounds like he cares.
[124:09.30]Where's this?
[124:09.88]How do you know what your secondary objective is?
[124:12.88]Uh, you just find him.
[124:16.01]I think that was like that thing you died in last round as a secondary objective.
[124:19.87]I see.
[124:21.39]You kind of gotta explore.
[124:25.04]Did you do the same thing that I did?
[124:26.44]I grabbed the bomb and I threw it at myself.
[124:29.64]No, I drove to it, got out of it, and the car rolled back and killed me.
[124:36.23]You can't trust cars.
[124:37.17]Evil they do.
[124:45.98]The cars do look really cool though.
[124:47.46]They're pretty sick looking.
[124:49.60]Yeah.
[124:51.53]They get stuck on shit pretty easily though.
[124:54.97]Yeah.
[124:57.59]Oh no.
[125:01.84]That's what we do.
[125:03.38]That's what that's what I do.
[125:06.74]So I think you cut through the door at that?
[125:21.42]Wait, really?
[125:21.78]I think you can cut through the door.
[125:24.23]I'll protect you.
[125:35.44]What is the purple question mark?
[125:38.31]Jerma pro tech oh that might be a secondary objective actually I think it is blow these up you've always got flashlights if you lose your way destroy the oh destroy the fungus yeah eat some and then again come on it's time to suck you know
[126:09.09]Don't trail off during that.
[126:11.02]Say it for real.
[126:12.92]Finish it.
[126:13.44]Yeah, if you're going to start that song, you better have the power to finish it.
[126:20.64]Come on, it's time to suck down the milkshake.
[126:24.79]Eat your arms and then again.
[126:28.58]Come on, it's time to go be the Mario!
[126:34.79]Ooh, that's a big resource.
[126:37.48]Some crazy flying machine just one-shot me.
[126:43.82]I'll get you.
[126:46.19]Oh my god, that is a crazy flying machine.
[126:57.44]What, did we die?
[126:58.54]I got you.
[126:59.94]Oh, near my screen.
[127:05.91]This looks like... This enemy looks like... You know the beer helmet?
[127:10.64]Yeah.
[127:11.72]Yeah.
[127:13.30]You'll see if you... You'll notice it.
[127:15.98]Yeah.
[127:16.56]The idea of those things is fun.
[127:17.65]It was before we killed it.
[127:18.93]Yeah, beer drinkers get this.
[127:22.11]Any beer fans?
[127:24.54]Hey!
[127:26.41]are we talking we're talking what kind of beer are we talking about a bush light or something else whatever they got a fenway do they make a bush hard yeah I think I don't know
[127:49.45]I saw a guy last night at the grocery store pushing around a full-sized cart, empty, asking every single employee, hey, hey, so you got the, you got Mike's?
[128:01.63]And the guy's like, what?
[128:03.57]He's like, yeah, the hard, the Mike's hard stuff.
[128:07.11]And I saw him walking around for 20 minutes with his empty cart and he never found it.
[128:11.56]He didn't find it?
[128:12.44]That's a shame.
[128:13.70]Yeah.
[128:14.68]Poor guy.
[128:15.44]Hey, you got the Mike's hard stuff?
[128:20.57]Whatever would he end up drinking now?
[128:23.27]I know.
[128:25.65]I don't think he ever got it because it was like closing time.
[128:27.96]Alright, we gotta find the power unit in here.
[128:38.93]Some say he's still searching for Mike's hard stuff to this day.
[128:42.19]Yeah.
[128:43.72]But if someone walks up to you and says, do you got Mike's?
[128:46.96]I wouldn't know.
[128:47.74]Like, I would say, do you want a microphone?
[128:49.16]What are you talking about?
[128:50.02]Yeah, same, honestly.
[128:50.96]It's not that popular of a thing.
[128:55.61]Just a little thing to flip, guys.
[128:57.01]I feel like those drinks... He was asking in the meat section as well, so... Those drinks are not popular, yeah.
[129:05.12]They really just kind of aren't anymore, are they?
[129:07.69]Not that, but you know what's popular is, like, ale.
[129:11.57]Like, flavored ale has become more popular.
[129:16.54]Flavored ale.
[129:17.78]Flavored ale and, like, hard seltzer.
[129:19.64]That became a big one.
[129:20.68]I remember, like, going to friends' parties last summer, and it was just, like, seltzer and ale.
[129:25.61]White Claw kind of took over the whole world in that regard.
[129:29.23]Yeah, White Claw, and there was another one, too.
[129:31.13]I forget what it was.
[129:31.91]Do you remember Smirnoff Ice?
[129:34.42]I drank that, yeah.
[129:35.14]That stuff was the weirdest.
[129:35.74]That was, like, some of my first drinking ever.
[129:37.84]Yeah, that was the weirdest liquid ever.
[129:39.42]It was... It's like an opaque, white, icy liquid, and it tasted...
[129:46.22]Nothing else on Earth tastes like that.
[129:47.93]Guys, I think we have to line these up, but I can't do them.
[129:50.29]I don't know.
[129:52.99]I can't, like, do both.
[129:54.09]I think we all have to hold it down at the same time.
[129:56.16]Go press hold E on one of them.
[129:58.54]Yeah.
[129:58.66]Damn, that was rough.
[130:01.30]Do you remember Bud Ice?
[130:03.80]Did we all do it?
[130:05.77]Yeah.
[130:06.01]I remember Bud Ice.
[130:07.69]It was terrible, but that was the first, like, alcohol I ever got drunk off.
[130:12.64]But didn't they do, like, Bud Lime and all that?
[130:15.91]Bud Light Lime.
[130:16.73]Yeah, that was another one.
[130:17.59]It was awful.
[130:18.85]It was really bad.
[130:20.07]Really bad.
[130:23.02]You know what?
[130:23.58]I'm speaking of weird combinations that brands do.
[130:27.24]You've ever had the Coca-Cola coffee?
[130:30.74]I tried a sip and I was like, okay, but then I was good after the sip.
[130:36.01]You guys just talking about food because Pokes here?
[130:38.29]No, man.
[130:39.49]I'm chilling.
[130:40.30]He's just chilling.
[130:41.82]I'm having a great time.
[130:47.70]We're talking about beer.
[130:48.28]I don't drink beer.
[130:50.30]Yeah, the Coke coffee is, like you said, Vinny, you take one sip and you go, oh, okay, that's the most amount of liquid I need to have of this.
[130:57.70]And that goes for the whole human race.
[131:00.55]Hey, Poke, this is you.
[131:02.25]Yeah, it was fine for like a sip.
[131:03.71]And then I was like, I don't need to know more about this.
[131:07.40]I don't need to explore this taste further.
[131:11.21]Yeah, you don't really care about having that flavor more.
[131:14.23]And they made, like, millions of bottles of that.
[131:16.78]One sip liquid.
[131:21.24]Can we just keep shooting this?
[131:22.14]Why is he laughing at us?
[131:27.35]What happened?
[131:27.79]He's, he's, Sterf thinks something's real funny right now.
[131:34.48]Where are we bringing this thing?
[131:42.26]Back to the drop pod.
[131:46.32]Oh, oh, oh.
[131:49.87]We have to roll it.
[131:50.63]Oh, wait, do we need two people to do it at the same time?
[131:54.61]Oh, God, we gotta... Oh!
[131:59.84]I tried.
[132:04.65]This thing can't be destroyed, right?
[132:10.59]Okay.
[132:12.56]Are you the resident roller?
[132:14.39]We have two people can be on it.
[132:18.63]Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.
[132:24.69]Back up, back up, what you wanna do now?
[132:31.26]Oh, it's stuck.
[132:33.64]Uh-oh.
[132:45.45]We're not very good at this.
[132:47.48]Uh, it's tough.
[132:48.98]The rolling is the hardest part of the game.
[132:51.70]No, the waiting is the hardest part.
[132:55.17]Waiting is the hardest part.
[132:58.91]No, Tom Petty, that's a timely reference, right?
[133:02.51]Everybody sucks.
[133:03.40]Everybody fucks.
[133:04.86]Whatever he says.
[133:06.68]Wait, Tom Petty says that?
[133:08.34]No, that's disturbed.
[133:13.40]What is that?
[133:13.94]What are the lyrics to that song?
[133:16.04]It's like, everybody sucks.
[133:17.90]Yeah.
[133:21.07]It's like, I don't give a fuck.
[133:22.45]Everybody sucks.
[133:24.39]Is it Chocolate Starfish?
[133:26.13]Chocolate Starfish and the hot dog flavored water.
[133:28.50]That really captured the mood of the time.
[133:32.88]The DBZ era.
[133:36.31]That was the DBZ era, man.
[133:38.27]what made that the dbz era was that like when it was like like all the edits on youtube or not youtube but limewire if you ever wanted to look up a song on youtube it was the like dbz amv yeah every time
[133:56.85]That's funny.
[133:58.33]I'm such a big Chrono Trigger fan that I should be a Dragon Ball Z fan.
[134:02.28]But when it was on Toonami, I didn't get it.
[134:05.02]And I was just like, I don't know.
[134:06.42]I like Ren and Stimpy.
[134:07.95]So I just never got into it.
[134:09.75]But I love the animation.
[134:11.57]Toriyama's stuff is amazing.
[134:15.50]You guys had Dragon Ball Z on TV, right?
[134:17.48]Yeah.
[134:18.64]Dude, did it do that thing for you where it's like... It's like right before... Goku does like a...
[134:26.50]What's it called?
[134:27.46]The bomb?
[134:28.66]Spirit bomb.
[134:29.22]They charge us for four episodes?
[134:30.42]Spirit bombs for four episodes.
[134:32.23]Right before it happens, they go back to season one the next day.
[134:37.29]Did they ever do that to you?
[134:40.52]Not that I recall, but probably.
[134:42.50]They did to me.
[134:44.42]The next day, I'm so excited.
[134:45.36]Oh, my God.
[134:45.84]Goku's going to do it today.
[134:47.26]Go home 8 p.m.
[134:48.90]Not back to season one.
[134:49.91]That's so funny.
[134:51.67]That's true.
[134:53.94]Yeah.
[134:55.66]Goku never do it.
[134:57.98]I'm sorry, guys.
[134:59.19]I for some reason, I ended up sliding down that hill so fast that I brought it to the drop pod.
[135:05.61]I think it's going to leave without you guys.
[135:07.64]Oh, shit.
[135:08.16]That's the drop pod.
[135:09.32]Oh, shit.

[136:01.70]Why do I only have six of these?
[136:03.54]Oh, he's mad.
[136:05.56]Why do I not have any resources here in the thing?
[136:09.45]Where's my premium loot that I was supposed to get?
[136:11.93]Yeah.

[136:26.34]Wait, we get less if we don't make it to the ship?
[136:30.17]Oh.
[136:30.85]Probably.
[136:31.79]Double loot is only for white currency.
[136:43.85]That's kind of good, but I don't want to use it.
[136:47.37]Have you ever seen that video of the Hitman assassin reacting to Hitman?
[136:54.12]I think I remember that.
[136:55.51]I feel like we talked about it.
[136:56.93]Didn't we talk about this?
[136:57.83]Okay, we did.

[137:09.41]Yeah, I got shooters.
[137:10.83]We did a shot a while ago.
[137:12.64]I know snipers.

[138:19.53]I'll be back in two minutes.

[139:30.98]There's like millions of songs, man.
[139:34.19]And if I pick one, then all the other ones get mad.
[139:37.01]If you could isolate all those millions into one song, what would it be?
[139:44.05]I know it will be the Aquabats or the LazyTown theme, but other than that, what else would it be?
[139:49.76]I genuinely was trying to think of the LazyTown theme.
[139:53.41]I was like, was Spartacus?
[139:54.51]What is the name of that show?
[139:56.49]You were really going to do that?
[139:57.81]I genuinely was thinking the whole time.
[140:00.44]That's weird, Ster.
[140:02.00]Of all of the songs, all the millions of songs, we're both thinking about LazyTown?
[140:06.37]And I don't even ever think about that shit, ever.

[154:21.23]Big mouth.
[154:22.67]No.
[154:24.16]It's a movie.
[154:26.18]Wait a little.
[154:26.88]Hold on, wait.
[154:31.61]There's a dog on this laptop.
[154:33.61]We have to bring this laptop back to the shuttle.
[154:35.90]My chat just got it.
[154:44.39]Am I checked out at two?
[154:45.41]Jaws?
[154:46.11]That's right.
[154:47.01]Diddy gets one point.
[154:48.45]It is the 50th anniversary of Jaws.
[154:50.39]It is.
[154:53.16]That's Jaws.
[154:54.30]Me next.
[154:59.21]I also got two of those Yukos, whatever.
[155:01.77]I'll throw them on any of these enemies.
[155:04.27]Yeah, I did, and I got two.
[155:06.08]We all get two now, I think.
[155:07.22]We share.
[155:10.20]Can you guys guess this movie?
[155:12.69]Cars.
[155:14.15]Cars that are furious.
[155:15.85]Nope.
[155:21.36]Old Yeller.
[155:22.66]I don't know.
[155:23.06]Is it a car?
[155:24.00]Can we get another one?
[155:29.73]Okay, I think we're ready to drop a pod here, yeah?
[155:36.50]Yeah.
[155:37.44]Is it a cat driving a car?
[155:39.88]Garfield?
[155:40.08]Garfield?
[155:42.98]You're thinking too hard.
[155:49.02]Drive?
[155:51.33]Yeah.
[155:52.63]Oh.
[155:53.01]Baby Driver.
[155:53.57]Starring Ryan Gosling?
[155:54.77]No, just Drive.
[155:56.03]What the heck is this?
[156:00.57]Oh, is it locked as the drop short?
[156:02.94]I thought it would be easy.
[156:05.18]I feel like all the easy ones, like Alien, we're thinking, like you said, way too deeply on it.
[156:10.24]Yeah, yeah.
[156:13.69]Which one is this?
[156:15.07]I will participate after this.
[156:17.62]What the fuck is that?
[156:22.51]It follows.
[156:27.18]That is actually a scene from the movie.
[156:30.93]Is that Incredibles?
[156:37.08]It's a cloudy with a chance of meatballs is what I typed in, and that's the top gift.
[156:41.50]Yeah, no, but you're doing it wrong.
[156:42.98]What you should do is clouds?
[156:45.59]A question mark?
[156:46.77]That's too much.
[156:47.79]That's too much.
[156:49.51]Oh, come on.
[156:50.23]You don't want to play the game correctly.
[156:52.83]I did already, and you guys all got it wrong with my picture of an alien.
[157:00.20]Oh, wait, it's leaving.
[157:01.56]Yeah, we got to get in.
[157:03.75]I was looking for the yukas.
[157:06.29]I got two at least.
[157:08.25]I think we got quite a bit.
[157:11.42]You guys, you got to get in here, man.
[157:13.02]No, I'm not going to make it.
[157:18.69]Keep it up and I'll take you out.
[157:19.75]Why did I do that?
[157:20.19]Am I the only one that made it?
[157:21.20]Do we lose loot?
[157:21.76]Do I lose loot?
[157:22.20]What the fuck?
[157:24.94]Do I lose loot for dying?
[157:25.46]No, I don't think you lose loot.
[157:26.50]I don't think you lose loot.
[157:27.33]I think it's okay as long as one person makes it.
[157:29.41]I think.
[157:31.79]I'm sorry.
[157:32.75]It was a knee-jerk reaction to throw a grenade in.
[157:35.51]I'm sorry.
[157:36.43]I was trying to lasso you guys.
[157:40.82]I kept targeting other stuff.
[157:48.03]Okay, then.
[157:49.74]Okay.
[157:52.66]Oh, I got a ton of stuff.

[161:22.56]Um, pencil, eraser, eraser head.

[162:34.70]Yep.
[162:36.42]Okay.
[162:37.46]Here, I got one.

[162:47.49]What's mine?
[162:48.39]You ready?
[162:50.65]Oh, Oppenheimer.
[162:51.77]Yeah.
[162:53.86]Okay, alright.

[163:46.46]Man.
[163:47.12]Oh, fuck.

[163:50.13]Oh, man.
[163:50.93]Because he just did.
[163:54.61]No, I'm just going to move on.
[163:56.55]Okay, how about this show right here?
[164:02.76]Oh, this one's good.
[164:04.00]This one's good.
[164:06.37]What the fuck?
[164:09.79]Season three.
[164:11.49]No, no, no.
[164:11.99]How about season four?
[164:15.17]Running skeleton?
[164:16.23]Wait, what?
[164:17.47]He already got it.
[164:19.01]Oh, what did he say?
[164:19.79]What was it?
[164:20.53]The walking dead.
[164:21.65]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[164:28.74]Yeah, we kind of are playing roulette with some of these gifts.
[164:32.19]Here, I'm going to mash the keyboard again.
[164:35.75]What the hell is that?
[164:39.64]At least he's powering up, I think.
[164:41.56]I don't know.
[164:46.89]I've never even, like, seen a movie, so this is hard for me.
[164:50.42]I gotta level this gun up.
[164:52.12]Yeah, I just... I just spammed my shit and it looks like a CD key.
[164:57.80]I forgot that even... Remember CD keys?
[165:01.53]Yeah.
[165:02.35]I do.
[165:04.61]You know, it's funny.
[165:05.27]I had my Warcraft 3, the original, and I couldn't find the CD key.
[165:10.38]I couldn't find the case.
[165:12.40]So I had to buy another one.
[165:14.58]And that was it.
[165:15.08]That's just gone after that.
[165:16.52]Yeah.
[165:17.81]damn yeah the internet before the internet and there was no oh I'll just maybe go get another one you had to if you lost your cd key if you didn't write it down or have it somewhere you didn't the game was gone yep also no backups before we were even a born Jerm back in like the early 80s
[165:43.05]The CD keys were actually like the instruction book had like a puzzle.
[165:46.46]Like Monkey Island had like a little decoder to make sure you weren't pirating it.
[165:51.00]There'd be like little puzzles and you'd have to like answer questions that only the instruction booklet could answer.
[165:57.65]This is very, very weird.
[165:59.19]That's weird.
[166:00.57]Yeah.
[166:05.98]Space Quest did that too, I guess.
[166:08.94]What's that?
[166:12.33]Sir, what'd you say?
[166:13.70]nothing I said somebody in my chat said space quest did something like that sounds about right sounds wrong born wrong why are you gonna keep reminding me not you I'm just it's like a scent like a phrase
[166:38.54]You guys guessed this game?
[166:42.68]It's a common phrase.
[166:47.98]Close.
[166:49.63]Starcraft.
[166:50.79]Yes.
[166:53.89]Yeah, why would that have been Minecraft?
[166:55.07]What the hell am I talking about?
[166:57.51]But you really thought so?
[166:58.73]I just saw the craft at the bottom, and I really wanted to win the round, so I just blurted out the first thing that was in my mind.
[167:04.50]Yeah, you should lose points for guessing wrong.
[167:06.42]We need to change the rules.
[167:13.54]What the heck is this?
[167:17.24]I could have got in the car, but I don't care.
[167:25.84]I've seen some explosions.
[167:26.92]Oh, you gotta get the Bob Euchre trees.
[167:32.49]Connect the power cable.
[167:33.75]Where are they going?
[167:34.79]Oh, to where?
[167:35.55]Oh, I see it.
[167:37.78]It's way...
[167:40.54]that way for this one.
[167:42.78]Oh, you can ride these things like your Tony Hawk.
[167:46.78]What the hell?
[167:47.51]That is his super power.
[167:48.53]That's mental.
[167:51.41]What the heck?
[167:52.91]This is an increase the difficulty on this one.
[167:56.82]Heads up.
[167:57.98]Warning.
[167:58.62]Warning.
[167:59.38]Warning.
[168:00.04]Alert.
[168:01.79]Intruder alert.
[168:03.19]Intruder alert.
[168:05.27]Die, mortal.
[168:23.01]I hate how he's got his little protective field here.
[168:26.43]Yeah, that stuff's annoying.
[168:29.96]You gotta get in there.
[168:30.74]Oh, that was weird.
[168:31.88]I gotta punch more.
[168:32.50]Punching is better than I thought it was.
[168:36.20]It's pretty good.
[168:41.19]I like this mechanic, but I don't know where we're bringing this.
[168:44.33]Oh, I see, I see.
[168:47.30]Let's just make a fun state.
[168:49.72]Dude, we can make our own Tony Hawk.
[168:56.91]Oh, I guess they're right there.
[168:59.29]Wait, there's two power cables.
[169:00.68]Should I bring the other one somewhere?
[169:02.26]The other one goes this way.
[169:06.90]So where are we taking this one, Vinay?
[169:09.19]I see it.
[169:09.93]When you hold on to it, it'll show you the destination.
[169:12.63]It's up there, believe it or not.
[169:14.63]Oh, weird.
[169:16.39]I don't believe it.
[169:16.99]I'm going to try something.
[169:20.52]Let me get up here.
[169:21.58]There's a jump pad right over there.
[169:24.22]Yeah, it's right up here, guys.
[169:25.90]I'll tag it.
[169:26.98]I'm going the other way to the blue one.
[169:31.41]I'm going to Ster.
[169:34.15]I like how we just split up into our own clicks.
[169:37.68]Those who get it and those who don't.
[169:41.62]This is the better click right here.
[169:43.48]Yeah, they're so close to getting it.
[169:46.12]Too far.
[169:50.71]Is it because this monkey can't connect up there?
[169:55.00]No, it's being blocked.
[169:58.46]I'm testing it back home.
[170:00.18]It's a nice ride, sir.
[170:02.27]Ours is way smoother than theirs.
[170:03.73]Maybe all the way around?
[170:04.97]Oh, my God.
[170:05.85]You took it all the way up there.
[170:09.46]And ours is cheaper to ride.
[170:12.44]But ours is more fun.
[170:14.53]We're having fun.
[170:15.55]And it goes up.
[170:16.21]Yeah, it goes up.
[170:18.21]Look at that, Jerm.
[170:19.05]Oh, man, we got it.
[170:20.80]Yeah, ours is way more fun.
[170:23.01]I haven't ridden it at all yet.
[170:24.61]Ster wants efficiency.
[170:25.83]He doesn't want fun.
[170:29.96]Classic.
[170:31.32]We did ours first.
[170:34.44]Yeah, how do we... Oh, yeah, we did do ours first.
[170:36.93]They've been doing it longer than us, too.
[170:39.03]Yeah, but because we made it more fun.
[170:40.57]We took our time with it.
[170:42.09]Well, Vinny did.
[170:42.78]I watched and I clapped.
[170:45.88]The support was nice.
[170:47.58]Jerma, it's really fun.
[170:48.64]It's really fun if you go on it.
[170:51.80]Dude.
[170:52.02]Whoa!
[170:54.74]Right?
[170:56.30]Now this is right.
[170:57.04]Did you just brake?
[170:58.18]Holy shit.
[170:59.09]We even have turning.
[171:00.27]We have multiple tracks that connect over to each other's.
[171:06.96]Yeah, why is our objective the same thing again?
[171:09.96]Or do we need to go to another one?
[171:11.58]They're not in the wrong slot, are they?
[171:14.33]No.
[171:14.93]No.
[171:17.99]Do we have to turn the computers on?
[171:19.21]No.
[171:20.52]Oh yeah, there's a big switch.
[171:21.82]It's like a comedic mouse trap.
[171:24.00]It wasn't letting me touch it.
[171:26.55]But maybe I was too early.
[171:27.91]Connected to more things.
[171:30.92]Is there more things?
[171:32.14]More?
[171:34.84]Oh crap.
[171:36.31]We gotta pick it up again.
[171:36.85]Yeah, there is more things.
[171:50.56]Yeah, this thing is gone.
[172:04.81]Yeah, see Vinny, you build it and then I test how fun it is.
[172:07.27]It's a very important job.
[172:09.81]You're not wrong.
[172:11.98]That was a fun one.
[172:12.86]I liked how it slid down and wrapped around the pole a little.
[172:15.44]Yeah, it's kind of cool, right?
[172:16.50]We got a big scary guy behind us.
[172:21.72]Whoa.
[172:22.88]Whoa.
[172:24.35]We doubled.
[172:27.27]You're beating us, man.
[172:28.45]I'm getting smushed.
[172:31.50]Here, you throw a short one.
[172:35.96]I'm grabbing it, throwing it.
[172:39.83]What if you throw multiple?
[172:41.81]I said throw a short one.
[172:43.19]I think we both just max distanced.
[172:50.77]Somebody said I'm like the duck that talks in Tom and Jerry.
[172:55.15]Who's that?
[172:58.17]Is it duck?
[173:00.85]I like ducks.
[173:02.52]That's about a cat and a mouse.
[173:06.72]Wait, is that the one?
[173:07.80]Is that the one that talks like this?
[173:09.66]And he's like, oh, I'm very, very sorry.
[173:12.87]It's that one, right?
[173:16.77]Oh, no.
[173:17.67]Oh, boy.
[173:18.93]Oh, that one.
[173:20.43]You guys ever see that guy on Instagram who yells Poo Poo Spray or no?
[173:24.18]No.
[173:25.86]Is he famous for that?
[173:27.12]Like what is the deal?
[173:29.25]He just goes in like public bathrooms and yells Poo Poo Spray.
[173:33.77]Como dice Poo Poo Spray?
[173:36.22]Like really loud.
[173:38.02]Like an ogre.
[173:39.76]Oh.

[175:35.56]Oh, right.
[175:36.72]I think, Ster, you're already up there, aren't you?
[175:38.46]Yep.
[175:46.16]pop it oh no they're spawning enemies on us so many enemies too many can we get a healer in the squad
[176:10.40]There actually is a healer.
[176:11.66]I think Poke can heal.
[176:12.98]Is there?
[176:13.26]Wait, what?
[176:13.56]I think there is, yeah.
[176:14.98]Yeah, Poke, get your F button.
[176:16.37]I thought that was damage.
[176:19.77]I think you have healing missiles or something.
[176:21.98]I saw it on the screen.
[176:23.96]Oh my god, everyone group up.
[176:27.49]Oh god, shit.
[176:30.51]Who needs healing right now?
[176:32.72]You can see health on the left side of the screen.
[176:34.08]Oh, it is like floating around.
[176:39.08]Sir, I'm going to put F on you.
[176:43.99]Oh, it healed.
[176:45.85]I'm dead again.
[176:46.47]Fuck.
[176:49.08]Apparently we did have a healer.
[177:00.31]Kill.
[177:01.09]No, don't kill me.
[177:03.79]Oh my God.
[177:04.62]I'm so glad I jumped over that.
[177:08.34]Jeez.
[177:11.64]How many of us are dead?
[177:17.28]Just me?
[177:18.68]I'm getting you.
[177:20.81]I'll try to just clear out some enemies a little bit.
[177:25.07]Oh my God, I have no bullets.
[177:34.02]I see the body here.
[177:39.92]I'm going to throw it over to you, Vinny.
[177:45.81]Oh, that would have been so cool.
[177:46.61]They just missed each other.
[177:47.67]Oh, God.
[177:48.25]That would have been sick.
[177:54.82]I'm almost dead, too.
[177:58.82]Don't do it.
[177:59.76]I'm dead.
[178:06.09]There's a lot of bullshit over here.
[178:09.30]Yeah.

[179:32.67]That's good, though.
[179:33.59]What's good is good.
[179:35.33]It's delicious.
[179:36.09]If only we could 3D print them.
[179:39.78]Dude, what is going on with this guy's arms?
[179:42.26]He's glowing with nuclear arms.
[179:48.27]Where is his core?
[179:55.58]Okay, next one complete.
[180:00.73]What the fuck?
[180:06.19]Use each decommissioner's control terminal to align its disk with the satellite.
[180:15.28]I'm aligning.
[180:22.74]I need cover while I'm aligning.
[180:26.51]I'm dead.
[180:26.93]I'm dead.
[180:27.51]I got it though.
[180:30.39]Wicked.
[180:33.55]I'm trying to get rid of all these immunity bots.
[180:36.68]Yeah, these bots are really annoying.
[180:46.22]Remember, if you guys see my towers that I can construct, you can grapple onto them.
[180:51.93]They give you a huge speed boost.
[180:54.77]Yeah, they're really helpful.
[180:56.57]Really good.
[180:59.10]I'm going to come get you, Vinny.
[181:01.18]I'm alright.
[181:02.68]It's Poked.
[181:03.38]It's you.
[181:05.59]You wouldn't give us that cat.
[181:09.10]Yeah, I put explode.
[181:10.74]Oh no!
[181:12.12]Yeah, I know, I don't know, it freaked me out.
[181:16.37]Your guy's is lying.
[181:19.57]Uh, I don't know about this.
[181:20.93]It's like an Among Us task.
[181:25.70]With the fucking satellite alignment.
[181:30.95]Amogus?
[181:34.68]It's weird to think I've never played Amogus with you, Poe.
[181:37.21]I hated Amogus.
[181:43.53]Just such a huge game for so long.
[181:46.32]I'm terrible at lying.
[181:47.92]Yeah, I was so bad at it, dude.
[181:49.80]Constantly.
[181:50.54]I died first every round.
[181:52.72]I had like one good round ever.
[181:56.75]Really?
[181:57.63]I played it like once ever with you in VR, Vinny.
[182:01.65]And it was such a fucking funny, like, you try to stab me, and that clip just always, always comes back.
[182:10.24]It's amazing.
[182:12.49]Can we do VR soon?
[182:13.77]It was a fun time.
[182:15.31]I want to do VR.
[182:16.11]I just have been so lazy about it.
[182:18.01]But yeah, I want to do VR.
[182:19.42]Get the Beyond 2.
[182:21.56]I saw that.
[182:22.22]It might make it fun for you, you know what I mean?
[182:24.52]Yeah.
[182:27.35]Yeah, I've had the index for five years.
[182:28.87]It's good still, but I'm curious to see how far.
[182:32.72]Yeah.
[182:34.08]Like, compared to the new stuff, it's nice.
[182:35.62]Like, the lightness.
[182:36.78]Poke, let me get a heal.
[182:38.15]Oh.
[182:38.55]You got it?
[182:39.83]I died.
[182:41.13]I'll get you.
[182:43.43]Oh, my God.
[182:44.59]What even?
[182:45.04]I have double full health, and what if some bomb killed me?
[182:53.43]There's a new thing, a Beyond 2 VR.
[182:57.17]Yeah.
[182:58.33]there was a beyond one yeah their first one the beyond two looks nice like a lot of changes like moving the eyes apart and it's been a while since I've played any VR it's been probably at least two years or so have we evolved past a look into the mirror and look at how funny you are is that still no that's still that last night no now it's just look how sexy you are okay
[183:28.93]No one laughs anymore in VR, they just... True.
[183:32.41]Just look at themselves, yeah.
[183:34.28]Yeah.
[183:36.86]Dremma dead again?
[183:37.76]No, I'm fine.
[183:38.22]Oh, no.
[183:42.07]Yeah, so poke.
[183:43.21]Grab this.
[183:44.77]Oh, okay, cool.
[183:45.41]You got it.
[183:46.46]Alright, cool.
[183:46.76]Don't do it.
[183:47.68]It's a trick poke.
[183:52.58]Not down.
[184:00.69]Attempt to grab this.
[184:01.79]Got it.
[184:13.26]Dude, he's sucking it up.
[184:14.63]One of these fucking bastards.
[184:17.71]Dang it.
[184:29.03]Reload.
[184:35.23]Reload.
[184:36.21]Reload.
[184:36.77]Reload.
[184:37.55]Reload.
[184:38.01]Don't do it.
[184:38.49]Don't reload.
[184:39.23]It's a trick.
[184:40.16]Reload.
[184:41.10]Reload.
[184:41.56]Reload.
[184:41.98]I don't know what that's from.
[184:45.32]Is this not where I got to put it?
[184:46.44]I think it is.
[184:51.27]You have to turn the house of the dead, apparently, according to my chat.
[184:55.32]I didn't technically.
[184:56.26]I just read the chat message, but I like, you know, I feel good.
[184:59.26]Great job playing it.
[185:01.10]Oh, I thought this was an end of the You Did It cutscene and we were flying around riding on a thing.
[185:08.21]You've just been riding this whole time.
[185:12.63]Jerma always gets to ride.
[185:14.22]And he's dead.
[185:15.38]I died because I... You know what?
[185:19.72]You put it on hard mode.
[185:23.05]We mostly did okay, I think.
[185:27.15]Yeah, except for one person.
[185:29.12]Somebody said, hey, it looks like you wanted them to come and mop up, boys.
[185:42.96]Oh.
[185:47.10]I know what that's a reference to.
[185:48.38]I can't.
[185:50.97]I can't.
[185:51.77]Give me.
[185:54.65]Mopping?
[185:55.63]No!
[185:56.04]You can't heal yourself as this character?
[185:58.07]Okay, cool.
[185:59.45]Oh, okay.
[186:02.03]Oh, that was not a health pickup.
[186:06.30]Oh, Poke, where is your... Oh!
[186:11.60]I'm getting destroyed.
[186:13.46]Oh!
[186:21.51]Oh, me and Poke are dead.
[186:22.37]What is that?
[186:22.96]What is that?
[186:29.32]Is everyone dead?
[186:30.06]I think it's... Yes.
[186:33.33]I'm gonna leave without you.
[186:37.29]I would never.
[186:37.79]Thanks.
[186:39.63]Oh, thanks!
[186:40.65]Oh my god, he didn't leave me.
[186:42.06]Oh shit.
[186:51.83]I didn't expect to live.
[186:53.31]Thanks.
[186:54.39]I'm in the pod.
[186:57.78]Wait.
[187:01.69]Shield's crazy.
[187:02.37]Shield's not holding up.
[187:03.55]Yeah, that's the best part about this character.
[187:06.25]I'm dead.
[187:07.19]What?
[187:07.67]What?
[187:08.42]Should we go without you or what?
[187:10.16]I'll get him.
[187:10.54]Alright, you go get him.
[187:11.74]I'll keep the ship safe.
[187:13.38]Drive down the wire.
[187:14.48]It's too much ship.
[187:19.71]How do we poke?
[187:20.19]I got his head.
[187:25.22]Bring it inside.
[187:25.66]Just bring it inside.
[187:27.22]Oh wait, is he alive?
[187:28.04]Yeah.
[187:30.91]Oh!
[187:35.90]Oh, somebody got some shit in here.
[187:36.96]Oh, my God.
[187:37.20]It's in the ship.
[187:38.10]We're good.
[187:38.42]Alright.
[187:38.64]I'm in.
[187:39.86]We did it.
[187:41.47]Level five.
[187:43.97]Wow.
[187:45.23]Wow.
[187:46.69]Let me just say, wow.
[187:53.94]Shoot.
[187:54.80]Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.
[187:57.96]Wow.
[187:59.02]Okay, then.
[188:00.82]Well, that just happened.
[188:03.24]That's my favorite kind of dialog.
[188:04.82]I don't have to see that screen.
[188:11.55]Epic dialog.
[188:12.59]Collected one resource.
[188:14.71]Yeah.
[188:17.78]Boy, mate, you fucking got a problem.
[188:19.84]Gotta get this leveled up.
[188:23.26]Be sure to collect the resources on your guns when you level them up, by the way.
[188:26.95]You'll see it at the top.
[188:28.49]It's like kind of weird.
[188:29.47]I don't know why they did that, but...
[188:31.58]What do you mean?
[188:33.00]Why did they do that?
[188:35.32]When you go to inspect a gun on the top there, if it's glowing, you can claim a resource.
[188:44.27]Oh, what?
[188:45.41]Yeah, it's kind of strange.
[188:47.02]It's like a battle pass.
[188:49.40]Battle pass, baby, please.
[188:56.96]Man, I need more green.
[189:03.44]Bullets, shark.
[189:08.23]Infinity burn, wow man, infinity burn.
[189:10.40]What the fuck?
[189:17.62]You can't have two elements on at the same time.
[189:30.00]Guys, I might have to bounce in a bit.
[189:32.72]How's it looking for everybody else?
[189:36.19]I'm hungry.
[189:37.01]Let's go.
[189:38.17]I'm here as long as I'm required.
[189:43.25]What was your answer, Poke?
[189:45.48]I'm hungry, so I'm down for whatever.
[189:48.04]Okay.
[189:50.16]How about you, Jerm?
[189:51.52]I was going to do... Oh, hey, the perfect transition.
[189:56.06]The Monster Rancher.
[189:57.37]I got to give some info for you guys.
[190:00.17]okay info big important info when you make your monster you we've decided through some trial and error last night that you are going to make your monster not go past two years old that gives you 24 months to train one of your three monsters
[190:21.13]okay uh some monsters get better stats the older they get but if that ends up happening to you kind of tough luck hope you pull something better chat how long did I train my monster for probably not it takes about I'd say at least one to three hours to train two years
[190:44.64]I've never played this game before what if we don't end up having enough time in life to to get our monster trained up that high exactly still be okay it will still be fine because he will not forgive you offline uh we can make sure that you get him trained up we'll get him trained up offline okay okay because I have three monsters I got them yep but I I also have pushed one of them so hard that I think he's gonna die in like another year
[191:12.80]Is this a PS2 game?
[191:15.29]Where do I get my monster?
[191:16.85]On a USB?
[191:18.03]Steam.
[191:18.75]They remastered it and they ported it to Steam.
[191:22.52]So the four of you at some point before the 28th.
[191:26.64]It's going to take you like an hour or two per monster.
[191:29.64]So you can do fast forward mode and you can skip a lot of stuff.
[191:34.57]You should let your chats help you because the game is so complicated.
[191:38.50]The game is kind of...
[191:41.04]training and stat priorities and people are going to be like you have to do this you have to do that just do whatever you want it doesn't matter question I saw the you go first I it's just weird that he said let your chat help you but don't listen to him and do whatever you want well okay but you can do whatever you want but if people are going to be helpful if you don't want people backseating your whole gameplay then you could just be like everyone shut up for a minute hashtag Jerma partner yeah
[192:10.63]So what does the music have to do with the game?
[192:12.72]I was watching your stream for a second and you were looking up music.
[192:16.24]Is your monster based on music?
[192:17.78]It is.
[192:18.18]The original Monster Rancher 2 and Monster Rancher 1, I think Monster Rancher 3, there was a system in place where you could put any CD or DVD in the world and it would make a unique seed based on the data of the CD.
[192:34.67]So if you put, let's go for instance, Big Mama's House 2.
[192:40.44]into your PS2 when it was to generate a monster you'd get a monster that was unique to big mama's house too and it would be that same monster it doesn't matter if I brought big mama's house too over to my friend's house to watch and we put it in his Monster Rancher it'd be the same monster well that's actually crazy yeah and that's old tech that's from like almost 30 years ago
[193:02.86]But in the remake, in the remaster, you can't do that because obviously there's no discs.
[193:08.70]So the database...
[193:10.98]was ported over.
[193:12.14]So all the songs that were in there and they added a bunch of stuff.
[193:15.57]It's not a comprehensive list of every song ever made.
[193:19.27]And there's been at least some popular things that I was looking up last night.
[193:22.54]I think people tell me you ran into this problem too, where you couldn't find some stuff, but just pick whatever.
[193:29.26]The goal is for you to pick your top three favorite songs, your favorite songs.
[193:35.03]What are they?
[193:36.33]And are they in the database?
[193:37.80]And if they are, you have to use that monster.
[193:40.95]Yes, be tied to one of your favorite songs.
[193:45.71]So I found, like, I did, you know, like, backups, and it worked, but I had to, like, also do CDs, like, or albums.
[193:53.68]I just figured, okay, well, I can't find some of my specific songs, but the albums were there.
[193:59.37]So is that okay?
[194:00.79]Yeah, albums are fine.
[194:02.14]There's artist and there's title, and you can search by album.
[194:06.94]Do they have LazyTown?
[194:09.41]You're going to have to find that out.
[194:10.75]I don't know.
[194:11.86]Do we have a hard time on what time it's going to start on that day?
[194:15.49]No, it's going to be pretty flexible.
[194:16.89]This is not a big deal.
[194:18.14]This is just like probably five or six of us doing this.
[194:20.22]It's just kind of to fuck around.
[194:22.53]So whenever anybody has the most flexible time just to get people together to do it, the tournament's not going to take long.
[194:28.22]um it's probably we're gonna do three brackets where you're gonna pick one of your monsters and nobody is gonna know what everyone else's monster you know who else picked what so let's say okay here we are I'm picking my monster my monster butt chug uh I'll pick him and I'll put him into the tournament I I don't tell you guys that I'm doing that until you see that it's butt chug in the tournament okay and we're gonna do this three times
[194:55.17]Training, for you guys that don't know about training, if you go to Legend Cup, and I do recommend that you actually do this.
[195:04.04]Legendcup.com is a huge Monster Rancher 1 and 2 resource.
[195:10.43]There's training guides and data sheets, and I will link you guys this sheet.
[195:16.90]of what you should be buying and what you should be training because otherwise I'm going to dominate the whole tournament.
[195:21.33]I will beat everybody in one hit.
[195:23.75]Which is fine.
[195:24.25]That's cool.
[195:24.89]Sounds good for me.
[195:26.33]But there is like a good way to train your monsters and there's like a bad way to train your monsters.
[195:35.45]Somebody said this is a shitty flex.
[195:36.35]What's a bad way?
[195:37.76]Okay, if you just train, train, train and never rest and never give any of the nut oil or mint leaves, you're going to kill the monster.
[195:46.63]The monster is going to die.
[195:47.55]You overwork them.
[195:48.30]You overwork them.
[195:49.04]Their stats aren't as good and the monsters can die and they're gone permanently.
[195:53.40]So if you bring them into it, by the way, there is a reason to, you're going to have a bunch of money and a bunch of stuff unlocked.
[196:00.98]You can fight in tournaments for money.
[196:03.24]But there's another reason why you should fight in the tournament sometimes, especially if your monster likes fighting.
[196:09.20]You will get stat bonuses for doing that.
[196:11.55]You get stats for fighting and winning tournaments.
[196:15.78]By the way, Errantries, there's something besides just like the drills.
[196:20.76]You're just spoiling the whole game.
[196:22.11]That's how you learn moves, yeah.
[196:23.19]That's where you learn moves.
[196:24.73]That's why I'm just saying let your chats just like help you because the game is like a complicated, goofy mess.
[196:30.16]But it is one of the most fun games ever.
[196:32.64]So if you just feel like playing it, I just recommend playing it if you feel like doing that because you're going to have an unlocked save that is everything and it makes the game...
[196:41.51]I'm not going to say trivial, but the game is actually really hard.
[196:44.60]And monsters die, people get sad, your chat's going to get really, really attached.
[196:49.58]Just beware of that.
[196:53.53]You're losing a dude.
[196:54.17]Monster Retro 2, right?
[196:55.19]Not 1?
[196:56.85]It's 2 and 1 together.
[196:57.88]Monster Retro 1 and 2 DX on Steam.
[197:01.00]Yeah, and if you read the fine print of the rules, Jerma's allowed to train for three years instead of two.
[197:07.19]No, everybody, you can train up to two years.
[197:09.65]He needs this.
[197:10.37]You need to utilize nut oil and mint leaves.
[197:12.86]It will help you a lot.
[197:14.00]Make sure you follow the training regimen.
[197:16.54]Stats?
[197:17.56]That's up to you.
[197:18.66]There's a lot of reasons why you'd want to build a certain character certain ways.
[197:21.33]Or you could just say, who cares?
[197:22.27]I'm just going to do all...
[197:24.07]skill points and that's it and it'll be a laugh out loud moment on the stream we're just doing this for fun who gives a like just have fun with it alright oh you can dope as well you can't do drugs there is like drugs in the game that you can um use and those are allowed but you will kill the monster if you're not careful okay I'm gonna give my monster fent
[197:52.03]That was a fucking word salad, but the game is like really complicated.
[197:57.28]What are you guys?
[198:02.48]I'm going to go out to do research.
[198:05.07]It will take you one to two hours per monster to actually get to two years.
[198:09.41]So keep that in mind.
[198:12.91]And if we don't get to two years, we could cheat.
[198:14.92]Then we'll just like dope up your characters so they can.
[198:18.36]It'll be alright.
[198:18.90]Alright.
[198:22.10]there is a fast forward in the menu too it's you can blow through a lot of stuff but just do it do it however you want but it was fun I will do it I will do whatever I want yeah I'm concerned I'm concerned about Ster he's I feel like he's gonna that's why I'm taking it seriously I don't think I'm gonna take it I saw a bit of you playing you're taking this very very like definitely more than anyone else will
[198:53.36]I actually was thinking about maybe I shouldn't play in it, and I'm like, whoever wins the tournament has to go through the gauntlet of my monsters.
[199:00.48]Okay, so you're not going to play, but we have to play nine hours.
[199:05.15]I talked about that too.
[199:06.53]I talked about that too.
[199:07.79]Yeah, I heard.
[199:10.78]I don't know that I'm doing three monsters, man.
[199:13.26]I said it was one to two hours per monster.
[199:15.36]That's at total three to six hours of you needing to play.
[199:18.69]That's a lot, but it's alright.
[199:21.31]We played this for three or four hours.
[199:25.71]yeah per monster and you have to go to the training when when each of us died you know I was taking notes while you were talking alright but it was a good place you guys I'm making the dubai monster oh he got a geo dude and he leveled up intelligence what is wrong with him
