[00:02.09]This game is called Path to Die.
[00:03.95]It has two Steam reviews.
[00:05.61]It came out last week.
[00:07.75]I might be running into another... Oh, no.
[00:14.40]No, no, no.
[00:15.66]Once every three or four months, there's like a bad stream.
[00:18.54]Oh, hope not.
[00:21.54]The stream goblin shows up and he's like, yes, today's the day that I'm going to make the stream suck.
[00:29.18]And he, like, grabs me from, like, the back and pulls me back.
[00:33.82]Rips my neck forward.
[00:41.26]Oh, I see.
[00:41.84]You wanted to play.
[00:43.36]Oh, Space Channel 5.
[00:44.80]You loved the second one.
[00:50.93]And he fucking throws his hands out and casts, like, a bunch of magic spells at me.
[01:00.47]Or sneeze, whatever you want.
[01:04.11]Alright.
[01:05.05]Let's try this one.
[01:05.76]It's called Path to Die.
[01:07.02]It's like a top-down Hotline Miami-esque samurai game.
[01:11.72]You control it with the right stick.
[01:12.86]I don't know.
[01:13.54]It might be great.
[01:14.68]It might be a little hidden gem.
[01:16.34]It might not even be worth playing.
[01:18.07]But we're going to try.
[01:19.41]Welcome to the stream, everybody.
[01:20.61]Thanks for joining me.
[01:34.57]We may have found a great game.
[01:36.39]I'm okay with that.
[01:37.67]It looks pretty good.
[01:41.24]Let me just change this.
[01:42.24]Delay on that anymore.
[01:46.94]Same with this.
[01:47.56]Thank you for your patience, guys.
[01:48.58]I don't plan on shit like this happening, but sometimes it does.
[01:57.43]Here we go.
[02:03.58]Let's make sure the options... Oh, this is not plugged in.
[02:07.44]Yeah, I got a gamepad plugged in.
[02:09.96]I came prepared for this one.
[02:16.47]Sound... Let's see.
[02:18.45]Turn it up a little.
[02:21.65]Effects, graphics?
[02:25.37]Oh no, ambience.
[02:34.36]This looks familiar.
[02:35.18]It came out last week.
[02:42.77]So maybe it looks a little familiar.
[02:48.75]I am interested.
[02:49.35]I'm just going to make sure this is loud enough for me.
[02:52.49]Okay, that's better.
[02:55.13]New game.
[02:55.43]Here we go.
[03:06.36]So this is a game where it's a... Let's just experience it together.
[03:25.34]Brother, the clan is under attack.
[03:26.36]They are killing everybody.
[03:28.62]Bring your family to the backyard.
[03:29.90]Hurry, I will keep it clear.
[03:37.93]Brother, they killed her.
[03:38.67]I couldn't save her.
[03:39.41]Now I'm dying too.
[03:40.45]You must save my daughter at least.
[03:41.95]Please.
[03:43.28]Dad, no.
[03:45.60]This takes place in... I don't know.
[03:50.12]Monsters, you want to kill my uncle?
[03:51.50]Go away.
[03:53.28]But sir, no exceptions.
[03:55.11]No!
[03:57.77]She would probably be running.
[04:02.58]If I keep following this path, I will die.
[04:04.32]Fighting against the clan Nagano by myself is something only a madman would do.
[04:10.38]I could run away, live my life, and die in bed as an old man.
[04:13.21]But if I'm going to die either way, I prefer to die with the blood in my hands.
[04:15.99]I'll make them pay for what they did.
[04:22.20]Good morning, sir.
[04:23.12]Currently the entrance tax is 50 mon.
[04:26.26]Are you alone?
[04:27.42]The others went to grab something to eat.
[04:29.48]You're really unlucky, then.
[04:31.52]With this heat and the blazing sun, I think I am lucky waiting for them here in the shade.
[04:36.61]I say you are unlucky because now you have to fight me alone, young man.
[04:40.63]What?
[04:40.83]Why?
[04:41.17]Who are you?
[04:42.35]My name is Katsu Akabashi.
[04:44.91]Akabashi?
[04:45.65]You're from that clan.
[04:46.99]But they said there were no survivors.
[04:49.00]Your clan is going to pay for that mistake.
[04:50.70]Prepare yourself.
[04:53.15]Use the left stick to move around.
[04:54.29]You can hold right trigger to run, but this will consume stamina.
[04:58.35]If you tap, your character will dodge to the selected direction, avoiding damage except enemy arrows.
[05:04.42]Okay.
[05:07.10]Press A to interact with the environment.
[05:08.60]This will allow you to open doors or pick up objects.
[05:12.94]HUD shows you the amount of health.
[05:15.10]Bleed is the Amber part.
[05:17.48]Stamina is the white ring.
[05:18.60]Katana sharpness is the white blade and arrows you have.
[05:26.65]Alright, so... Red Circle is just health.
[05:30.60]Amber is the bleed.
[05:32.80]Stamina is the white ring, and then Katana Sharpness is the blade.
[05:37.58]Bleed limits the maximum amount of health you can have and increases in a small proportion with damage received.
[05:45.97]Okay.
[05:46.85]So, that's just max health for bleed.
[05:49.57]Katana Sharpness affects how much damage your attacks inflict, being halved with no sharpness.
[05:55.33]Okay, so I'm not going to keep that up.
[05:57.05]By pressing right bumper, you can lock on to enemies in combat.
[05:59.45]You can change the target by pressing left stick.
[06:02.77]The katana is your main weapon and is used with the right stick.
[06:05.31]By pressing it, you will unsheath or sheath your katana.
[06:09.98]With the sword sheath, you can draw and attack at the same time, only for left and right attacks.
[06:13.82]Okay.
[06:14.68]I'm going to have to try this.
[06:19.88]With a semicircle from left to right, you'll make a horizontal attack in that direction.
[06:23.28]So you go like bang bang.
[06:28.53]With one from right to left, you do the same, opposite direction, so bang bang.
[06:33.21]With a forward movement, you'll make thrust, which cannot be stopped by guarding, but it doesn't inflict too much damage.
[06:39.35]Moving the stick back and forth, make a vertical cut that will break the enemy guard or inflict great damage.
[06:44.80]The vertical cut can be charged when you see a flash, until you see a flash.
[06:49.78]Upon release, it will inflict double damage.
[06:51.46]You can also pivot with left stick.
[06:54.76]The 360 degree slash will help you create space if you see yourself surrounded and will damage all the enemies around you.
[07:00.57]Moving the stick towards the lower left corner and making a semicircle, the character rotates on itself with a sword.
[07:07.11]So you go down and all the way around.
[07:09.98]Okay.
[07:13.92]Extended, what?
[07:16.16]All attacks consume stamina, so be careful not to exhaust yourself in front of the enemy.
[07:19.46]Also, the enemy attacks have similar properties, so try to avoid guarding against a thrust.
[07:23.98]How do you guard?
[07:25.42]The yummy is the bow you will use throughout the adventure.
[07:28.61]It can be very powerful.
[07:31.61]I can hear it.
[07:32.59]But the amount of arrows is limited, so use them wisely.
[07:34.95]I'm still here!
[07:37.61]To equip the bow, hold left bumper.
[07:40.52]You can aim with the left stick to tighten it and to move the right stick.
[07:46.71]Okay.
[07:47.53]Hold left bumper.
[07:48.15]You can aim with left stick to tighten it more.
[07:50.93]Move the right stick back and let go to shoot.
[07:53.26]Okay.
[07:53.50]I'm going to just play around.
[07:57.70]Release left bumper to put away the bow.
[07:59.72]Patterns are the same with keyboard and mouse.
[08:02.70]I always recommended that I use a controller for this.
[08:07.46]A good defense can be decisive in any fight by holding left trigger.
[08:10.87]You'll start defending enemy attacks.
[08:13.23]You can continue moving with the left stick and you can choose the direction to look to with the right stick.
[08:18.34]This will also help.
[08:19.20]This will also make you lock onto the closest enemy in that direction.
[08:25.81]While defending, your stamina will not recover as fast in their case.
[08:28.00]It's blocking.
[08:29.48]If your stamina runs out, your defense will break.
[08:31.90]Remember that arrows or thrusts cannot be stopped by defending, and that blocking vertical cuts will drain a massive amount of stamina.
[08:37.98]Don't worry if you can't remember all the attack patterns.
[08:39.76]You can read it all again in the weapons section of your inventory.
[08:42.64]Okay.
[08:44.38]You need it.
[08:45.20]Now it's time to fight.
[08:45.96]Remember, draw your katana.
[08:53.00]What was lock on?
[08:54.20]Right bumper.
[08:54.58]Okay, here we go.
[09:03.08]Oh, fuck.
[09:10.64]I don't have any arrows.
[09:24.13]Come here.
[09:26.41]Fuck.
[09:26.89]Come on, thrash him!
[09:29.63]Oh yeah, I can dodge too.
[09:30.53]There's like a dodge roll.
[09:32.09]How good is it?
[09:37.39]How much health does he have?
[09:38.03]Okay, he's dead.
[09:38.93]Rest in peace, young man.
[09:41.01]The goblin's behind me.
[09:42.01]Stop.
[09:44.33]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[09:45.39]Rest in peace, young man.
[09:48.93]This is actually kind of fun.
[09:49.96]It's not bad.
[09:56.78]There's no turning back now.
[09:57.96]Alright, I can run.
[10:02.28]As you can see on your left, there are different types of items in the game that represent it as packages.
[10:07.08]Red packages are food and recover health.
[10:10.08]Green ones contain drinks to increase maximum stamina temporarily.
[10:13.48]And finally, purple contains bandages to heal bleeding and recover maximum health or wet stones to sharpen your katana.
[10:22.75]So there's bandages for bleeding and wet stones to sharpen katana.
[10:27.31]Not all objects will have the same effect and some will be more effective than others.
[10:30.01]Also, you'll find packs of arrows for your bow or keys that allow you to open new areas.
[10:35.48]Get that mouse off the screen.
[10:37.61]The number of packages you can carry is limited to 5 for each item and 15 for the arrows.
[10:41.87]Use them wisely.
[10:43.42]Navigate with the D-pad through your inventory.
[10:44.98]Press X to use the selected object.
[10:49.17]Did I mute the music?
[10:50.25]No, I didn't.
[10:53.68]You can also see a small table with a brush, ink, and paper on it.
[10:57.60]This is a save point, and there are many more throughout your adventure.
[11:01.15]It is very important that every time you see one, save your progress on it, or you could lose your valuable time since there are no checkpoints in the game.
[11:08.81]Be careful.
[11:09.53]God damn it.
[11:13.96]That's right, no checkpoints.
[11:18.34]Why don't you play Mario Tennis after this?
[11:20.32]Shut the fuck up!
[11:23.76]I got this.
[11:29.54]Okay, three.
[11:30.08]This is fine.
[11:30.78]Everything's fine.
[11:31.36]Everything's gonna be fine.
[11:32.72]Get out of here.
[11:34.10]Get out of my room.
[11:41.32]Is it, did I save it?
[11:44.88]I did, okay.
[11:48.26]Alright, so we got, okay, we have, that's healing.
[11:54.44]Okay, how much bleeding do I have?
[11:56.30]And then a whetstone.
[11:59.26]Okay, so this is health.
[12:01.99]This is, okay, bandage.
[12:03.41]Let's just have the health.
[12:04.31]I'm alright, I'm alright on health.
[12:05.79]How do I run?
[12:06.71]There it is.
[12:11.47]Oh, fuck.
[12:12.53]I'm almost dead.
[12:16.41]How do you change targets again?
[12:17.45]I'm dead.
[12:20.45]Because I can have a save point.
[12:27.15]Okay, that's how you change target.
[12:32.13]Oh, fuck.
[12:33.11]Oh, fuck.
[12:33.53]Target.
[12:34.87]What?
[12:36.20]I'm dead.
[12:40.80]How do you change targets?
[12:41.90]Did I miss?
[12:42.26]Let me... Hey, Lake Drinker, thanks for the five community subs.
[12:51.70]Thank you, Lake Drinker.
[12:52.73]For real.
[12:54.05]What happened?
[12:54.39]Yeah, there was... Am I missing something here?
[13:00.11]Alright, let me go back, hold on.
[13:05.22]Weapons.
[13:10.56]How do I change target again?
[13:12.54]That's semicircle, 360 degree slash.
[13:20.38]What's a movement tutorial?
[13:22.84]Play the Hotline Miami OST.
[13:34.70]Alright, maybe I should stealth this guy.
[13:42.06]Okay, click left stick.
[13:46.20]Shit.
[13:46.70]Oh my god, this is insane.
[13:49.36]I don't even have my weapon up.
[13:56.09]I'm dead.
[14:07.34]I got cut in half.
[14:22.29]Okay, take out the weapon.
[14:23.27]Alright, just one.
[14:25.80]Just get one at a time.
[14:26.68]No.
[14:27.38]No, no, no, no, no.
[14:27.96]What are you doing?
[14:30.76]I'm already almost dead.
[14:37.88]Watch that stamina.
[14:42.65]Oh, fuck.
[14:51.70]Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[14:59.02]Okay, good, we're good.
[14:59.86]Okay, I killed somebody.
[15:11.09]Where's the other guy that was over here?
[15:12.41]I'm gonna go left.
[15:15.47]Let's see.
[15:17.29]Let's try left.
[15:26.01]Item?
[15:27.19]What the hell did I just do?
[15:28.29]No, that's not- Fuck, I just took something.
[15:34.13]Why are you turning around?
[15:35.11]What the fuck are you doing?
[15:50.38]Right through the middle.
[15:51.12]Alright.
[15:54.64]That's the stamina boost thing.
[16:02.42]Alright, easy.
[16:03.07]I don't want to die here.
[16:04.07]He's got arrows!
[16:11.31]What do you got?
[16:12.15]Okay.
[16:13.11]A whetstone.
[16:13.87]I'm good on sharpness.
[16:17.36]The game has no soundtrack.
[16:18.20]I need to sing.
[16:22.13]Oh, the game probably has music, I'm just in the little first area.
[16:27.18]What's this?
[16:28.18]That's a person!
[16:28.98]Okay, I thought it was an item.
[16:43.04]Watch my stamina.
[16:45.44]Sing the hamster song.
[16:46.44]I'm not gonna sing the fucking hamster song right now.
[16:49.54]Why would I sing the hamster song?
[16:54.48]God damn it.
[16:56.08]I'm not going to sing the hamster song.
[16:58.79]Oh, alright.
[16:59.29]I'm getting better.
[16:59.79]Game crashed.
[17:22.91]No.
[17:24.35]No, no.
[17:26.49]Oh, it's okay.
[17:28.11]It's okay.
[17:32.78]My whole computer is locking up.
[17:35.28]Oh, boy.
[17:35.78]This is bad.
[17:37.32]I can't even access... Yeah.
[17:44.16]Yeah, my whole... I'm locking up hard.
[17:50.18]Everything's going to be fine.
[17:53.70]Everything's going to be just fine.
[17:56.79]Pretty relaxed.
[18:00.15]Let's open it again.
[18:01.55]I'm not going to get angry.
[18:03.25]I'm not going to get upset about any of this at all.
[18:08.95]We're just going to try again.
[18:10.01]And that's all you can do, right?
[18:12.71]That's it.
[18:13.47]Everything's fine.
[18:14.27]I'm happy.
[18:20.12]Can you see this on the screen?
[18:21.14]Yes, you can.
[18:21.66]OK, we've got the gamepad.
[18:38.04]End of happiness?
[18:38.80]No, I'm fine.
[18:39.32]I'm fine.
[18:39.72]I'm fine.
[18:42.01]2019 resolution.
[18:42.45]I wanted to calm down.
[18:43.29]Right?
[18:55.15]I wonder... Oh no, I got two.
[18:58.35]It's like three hits to kill somebody.
[19:12.22]Okay, you gotta string it together.
[19:15.08]Send me energy.
[19:15.94]I'm okay.
[19:16.68]Don't worry.
[19:17.34]I just... If I say it enough times in a row, it's gonna be true, right?
[19:25.43]Where's this?
[19:25.87]This is cool.
[19:42.49]The guy with the arrows is gonna piss me off.
[19:46.81]I gotta string it together.
[19:47.61]One, two, three.
[19:48.19]I don't even know where I am.
[19:53.62]I'm dead.
[19:56.33]I gotta pull this guy back.
[20:02.70]Are you gonna follow me or what?
[20:06.14]Wait, what?
[20:09.38]I missed.
[20:13.72]Where's the other one?
[20:14.38]Didn't I pick... There's no heal... There's a healing potion right here.
[20:25.18]There's one guy.
[20:26.46]Alright.
[20:32.23]Cut him in half.
[20:34.67]Not bad.
[20:35.13]I'm doing just fine.
[20:36.09]I just gotta get the mechanics down and I can keep going.
[20:37.87]I have no stamina.
[20:55.50]Alright, where am I at on the map?
[20:57.19]Over here.
[20:57.51]So I'm gonna ask, why am I playing this?
[21:00.55]Well, um... I had issues with Space Channel 5.
[21:07.10]And... It's alright.
[21:14.12]I'm gonna save the game over here.
[21:21.41]Wait, can I not?
[21:22.66]Once I pass it, there's a point of no return?
[21:25.28]So what's up here?
[21:30.72]Oh, come on!
[21:33.18]Is there really just nothing up here?
[21:39.79]No, there's got to be something here.
[21:43.23]No checkpoints.
[21:44.29]Yeah, but I mean, there's got to be something, though.
[21:45.99]See if I can get him in one hit.
[21:49.20]Go, go, go, go!
[21:50.10]Get out of the fucking way!
[22:17.76]Somebody said he's so sad.
[22:22.77]No, I'm fine, it's okay.
[22:28.61]Kill the goblin.
[22:29.81]I can't, he's invisible.
[22:42.88]Wait, can I like,
[22:46.89]I wonder if there's a way... Come here.
[22:50.15]Just walk into this.
[22:54.39]Is he dumb enough?
[22:57.51]Kind of.
[22:57.79]Alright, good.
[23:06.87]Mouse is not hidden?
[23:07.79]I got it.
[23:08.03]Alright, let me try going up here again.
[23:12.81]Where did you come from?
[23:14.65]This person wasn't here before.
[23:15.89]Yeah, they were.
[23:23.10]Gotta... No, this is a fun idea.
[23:30.30]It is.
[23:30.54]I can't block arrows.
[23:37.84]Alright, this is the guy that gave me the trouble before.
[23:52.96]I still have a heal, right?
[24:03.97]This guy knows what he's doing.
[24:04.75]I don't like fighting this dude.
[24:09.38]Shit.
[24:11.34]I'm going for it.
[24:26.09]Okay.
[24:32.10]Do you think we really watch you for gameplay?
[24:35.42]Come on, give me a break.
[24:37.48]I'm trying.
[24:43.44]I'm trying here!
[24:44.38]There's nothing up here.
[24:51.42]He's about to cry.
[24:58.44]What if I just turned on the webcam and tears were streaming down my face?
[25:02.90]What would you guys actually do?
[25:05.84]I was hysterical.
[25:10.30]I'M SORRY GUYS I'M DETROYING IT I'M SORRY Like it is fucking streaming down my face.
[25:22.93]I'd feel sorry but also kind of amused.
[25:32.05]Alright, I gotta get this guy.
[25:38.73]Okay.
[25:43.21]I would think it's a bit... Okay, I gotta heal again.
[25:55.56]Watch that stamina.
[26:00.78]Back it up!
[26:03.75]Look, let me just get through this first area, and then I'll put on, like, the fucking Yoshi's Story theme song.
[26:17.51]Don't stab.
[26:26.08]You wanna do that shit to me?
[26:26.90]Fine.
[26:30.66]Alright.
[26:31.54]I made it.
[26:35.83]Let me grab the other items.
[26:41.85]Can you take their weapons?
[26:44.07]I don't think you can.
[26:46.07]Anything else down here?
[26:50.41]There's even more.
[26:53.21]No checkpoints either.
[26:56.93]Dude, this game is brutal, man.
[27:00.63]The door is locked, you need a key.
[27:02.15]Of course.
[27:09.45]They just don't make them like, they don't make them brutal like this anymore.
[27:14.15]No checkpoints?
[27:14.97]You gotta find the fucking key?
[27:16.85]Ugh.
[27:20.00]I wish Mario was like this.
[27:30.74]Alright, this is the only, okay so, for future reference, if I die again, I only have to go left.
[27:39.93]Did I get them both?
[27:40.57]I think I did.
[27:41.71]Shit.
[27:42.15]I don't want them both.
[27:42.69]At least I have a heal.
[27:45.97]Ah, fuck.
[27:54.50]Just one at a time.
[27:59.76]Stop pulling aggro before the tank!
[28:04.53]I'm sorry, I can't help it.
[28:12.32]Fuck, he hit me.
[28:16.70]Give me a fucking break.
[28:17.69]Heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.
[28:20.61]Seriously?
[28:28.05]Key has to be right up here, then.
[28:29.23]That's only to... First time I've cleared this area.
[28:31.07]Alright, we're gonna play Mad Libs, okay?
[28:38.42]Once you're done in an area, you really get a sense of
[28:50.44]No, it's not Brep.
[28:54.97]Why would you even... Why would that even be... Okay.
[28:59.07]My sharpness is going down, though.
[29:08.43]Retitle the stream to Jerva's Unrelenting Sadness.
[29:19.78]Shit!
[29:20.42]Come on, there's only one guy here.
[29:27.23]Nice!
[29:28.21]Key?
[29:29.13]No.
[29:29.77]Health.
[29:30.19]Wait, you have more.
[29:31.39]What else is here?
[29:31.87]That's the tea for the stamina.
[29:39.33]Bandage for bleeding.
[29:45.93]You've unlocked a piece of the map.
[29:47.33]Press select to see the new zone.
[29:50.83]Is there a save point?
[29:52.23]I know there's no checkpoints, but there's... Ooh, yes.
[30:04.68]Okay, we're good.
[30:08.96]Well, I didn't even see that guy.
[30:15.33]Can I do something with the cat?
[30:21.39]I wonder if there's, like, skill points.
[30:29.90]Shit, I got hit.
[30:34.72]I need a whetstone or something.
[30:37.92]This is for... This is for bleeding.
[30:42.64]I gotta use it.
[30:45.01]Right?
[30:46.55]Yep.
[30:47.37]I'm an idiot.
[30:49.79]This is for... What is this for?
[30:52.85]Special T?
[31:06.10]Blocked it.
[31:06.88]What an asshole.
[31:09.66]That was a good move.
[31:10.36]That was a good move, and I just could have showed up.
[31:17.52]Come here, let me just poke him.
[31:21.08]Well, I'm almost dead.
[31:26.11]What stone?
[31:27.63]No, just a rock.
[31:35.02]Oh no.
[31:44.24]I need to sharpen my blade.
[31:45.56]It took one or two hits to kill these guys before.
[31:47.42]I don't have any arrows either.
[31:51.40]Oh boy.
[31:54.24]I need to sharpen my blade.
[32:17.15]It's alright.
[32:18.81]Now I'm going to do this in the right order.
[32:25.37]What is that?
[32:25.67]I can go into buildings?
[32:27.88]What is this?
[32:31.54]What the hell?
[32:32.30]Is this a store?
[32:37.20]This is a store.
[32:38.88]This must be the inn.
[32:39.60]I need information so I should try to be friendly and ask one of the locals.
[32:50.27]Hello?
[32:51.01]Can I talk to the... Well, there's only one local.
[32:53.41]No, there's two.
[32:53.85]How do you talk?
[32:59.23]Well, I just ate... That's not a local I can talk to.
[33:03.44]Do I just eat something?
[33:05.46]No.
[33:05.56]Can I talk to you?
[33:18.43]Uh...
[33:22.25]Maybe sit down?
[33:27.13]Well, there's a whetstone, finally.
[33:28.95]This game is called Path to Die.
[33:32.06]And I don't hate it.
[33:37.16]Okay, let's just be clear about that.
[33:41.31]Wait, what?
[33:51.57]Can I sit?
[33:51.99]I can sit at these tables?
[33:59.07]Well, I'm gonna load the game because I, uh... I just fucked it all up.
[34:05.83]Uh... Is it the bath?
[34:14.09]Oh, I can't get in the bath.
[34:19.89]Or whatever that is.
[34:22.57]There's a giant dog pee pad.
[34:24.06]Can I steal?
[34:38.21]Um... Unless there's a way... Maybe it's a button I'm not pressing to interact?
[34:46.75]What about this person?
[34:49.36]Oh.
[34:50.86]I'm stupid.
[34:51.54]Hell, do you mind if I sit here?
[34:53.46]Can't you see I'm not in the mood?
[34:54.60]Don't be like that.
[34:55.19]Just want to talk a little bit while we drink.
[34:56.59]Let me treat you some sake.
[34:59.57]Deal.
[35:00.55]So I saw a large building to the east on my way here.
[35:02.69]Do you know what it's for?
[35:04.83]That is the private gardens of Hotaru Nagano, one of the sons of the feudal lord.
[35:12.49]Really?
[35:13.49]Is there some way to meet this person?
[35:15.77]That's not possible.
[35:16.41]He is an eccentric man who rarely leaves his house inside of the gardens.
[35:20.18]Even for most of us who work there, it would be difficult.
[35:24.18]So you work there.
[35:25.32]Could you let me in the next time?
[35:27.82]What, do you want to get us killed?
[35:28.74]Listen, you don't know these people.
[35:30.54]They don't like outsiders and they are ruthless.
[35:32.33]A lot of people came to this village because they lost their homes in the war and came here seeking protection.
[35:37.98]And we have it, but they treat us like dogs.
[35:40.39]We work all day for them and they barely give us enough food to survive.
[35:43.53]Particularly the captain of the guard is really rotten.
[35:47.91]They even arrested my daughter for confronting him.
[35:50.21]She's just a kid.
[35:51.77]I don't even know if I will see her again.
[35:53.65]I'm not going to do anything that could harm her.
[35:55.55]We shouldn't have come here in the first place.
[35:59.09]Webcam turns on.
[36:00.79]Tears going down his face.
[36:04.13]Just like me.
[36:08.15]Hey, Uncle, training again?
[36:09.28]Why do you practice so much every day?
[36:10.84]Why?
[36:11.12]Someone has to protect the clan from our enemies.
[36:14.08]Then you protect me and Daddy and Mommy?
[36:16.86]Of course, that's my job as a samurai.
[36:22.36]What if I take your daughter back?
[36:25.07]What, are you serious?
[36:26.35]I will take your daughter back if you accept to help me.
[36:29.23]What do you want with the Nagano clan so badly that you are willing to risk your life for it?
[36:36.48]For a quarter of a second, I thought that said vegetables, but it's vengeance.
[36:41.77]That's a huge one.
[36:43.43]That's the biggest one we've seen all night.
[36:48.85]Very well, if you take Yuki back, I will help you, but if you get caught, I don't know you.
[36:53.04]That's fine.
[36:53.62]Where could they have taken your daughter?
[36:59.72]Everyone's getting timed up.
[37:01.43]You're all getting destroyed by Nightbot.
[37:04.05]There's a rectangular building in the center of the village.
[37:06.01]They use it as a headquarters as well as training.
[37:08.05]Should be there.
[37:09.67]Rectangle building in the center of the village.
[37:12.85]Just whatever happens, don't let them hurt her.
[37:14.71]Understood.
[37:15.41]I'll be waiting for you here in the room upstairs.
[37:17.88]Thank you.
[37:26.86]Do I get a better weapon or something?
[37:30.68]It's almost like spamming characters gets you timed out.
[37:34.39]How was I supposed to... Is this out there waiting for me?
[37:39.01]Okay.
[37:45.28]So we need to go in the middle of the village.
[37:46.84]There's a rectangle building right in the center.
[37:56.85]Dude, it's all about getting them before they can pull their sword out.
[38:04.33]I think I'm gonna have to whetstone here.
[38:09.95]Yeah.
[38:16.59]Somebody has a bow.
[38:21.84]This guy's shooting a lot faster than the other ones were.
[38:23.70]Okay, is this the building here?
[38:31.28]Are we in the middle?
[38:33.94]I think I'm right in the middle.
[38:37.62]Yeah?
[38:39.52]Stop right there.
[38:40.30]This property is off limits.
[38:41.50]State your business.
[38:42.24]I didn't come here to talk.
[38:45.35]Parry yourselves.
[38:47.47]What the?
[39:04.33]Oh my god, there's somebody right back there.
[39:06.75]Oh my god, no.
[39:08.47]Alright, we're fine.
[39:15.91]Shit.
[39:34.91]What'd he drop?
[39:37.50]I'm gonna need arrows, finally.
[39:40.66]Hey, a pick!
[39:42.54]Thank you for the five community subs.
[39:46.96]Anything else in this room?
[39:47.72]Thank you, a pick.
[39:49.82]What is this?
[39:51.20]More arrows?
[39:52.96]I feel like I'm gonna need these.
[39:56.59]And is that a save point?
[39:57.67]It is.
[39:57.81]Do I have any healing?
[40:09.06]Did I miss something?
[40:09.94]Make sure I don't miss any health potions.
[40:11.48]That's a big one.
[40:16.21]Is this a boss fight?
[40:17.75]I feel like this is a boss.
[40:28.13]So you're the bastard who's been killing my men.
[40:29.63]What in the world would you come this far for?
[40:31.45]Is it the stupid girl?
[40:32.77]I've come for the girl and your head.
[40:35.93]You're really full of hate.
[40:37.05]Have I tortured you before?
[40:38.35]I am Katsu Akabashi.
[40:41.35]I will avenge my clan, starting with you.
[40:46.19]I hope you are ready to pay for your life.
[40:49.67]I dare you.
[40:59.33]Whoa, he's quick.
[41:02.19]Whoa, that's not how you do it!
[41:04.51]What's the- how do you do it?
[41:11.17]Back it up.
[41:11.59]Oh no, oh no, I'm dead.
[41:23.16]Oh no, oh no.
[41:28.86]Let me actually use this health potion.
[41:34.51]Alright, so it's left bumper, and then back on the right stick.
[41:57.44]I don't know.
[41:58.54]I don't know if I want to do that.
[42:00.48]I'm dead.
[42:01.84]I'm not going to use the bow and arrow.
[42:39.69]Walk.
[42:47.22]Okay, watch out for the girl.
[42:55.48]Can the girl die?
[43:18.29]Alright, give me that healing.
[43:19.15]Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[43:25.45]That wasn't a health potion?
[43:26.51]I don't think, I think dodging is the way to go.
[43:47.16]What happened?
[43:47.64]Where am I?
[43:48.12]What?
[44:03.21]You won't get away with this.
[44:04.47]Oh, enjoy your well-deserved pain.
[44:12.12]Are you alright?
[44:12.96]How do you know my name?
[44:14.14]Your father told me.
[44:15.14]Come on, I'll explain it on the car ride.
[44:17.80]Close your eyes until we get there.
[44:19.62]You don't need to see this.
[44:27.85]Am I carrying her?
[44:36.47]Alright, don't leave anything.
[44:40.96]Nice.
[44:47.50]You put her in your pocket.
[44:53.89]Save game.
[44:55.33]Yes, please.
[44:56.11]I at least got to get to the first boss.
[45:09.55]I missed the dun dun.
[45:10.85]That was the first boss.
[45:12.05]It didn't have a health bar.
[45:12.77]It doesn't count.
[45:19.72]So we gotta go back to the bar.
[45:20.92]I was supposed to be nice to the locals.
[45:28.06]Yeah, the ones in the bar.
[45:44.19]Daddy!
[45:46.61]Oh, thank goodness.
[45:47.17]You're okay.
[45:47.63]I did my part.
[45:48.25]Now it's your turn.
[45:49.95]I know.
[45:50.35]Take the key on the table.
[45:51.29]It'll open the garden's gate.
[45:52.77]Now you can get in there whenever you want, but to get to Hotaru, you need another key to his house.
[45:58.57]I'll find a way.
[45:59.31]You should hide.
[46:00.30]When they find out what happened, they will come for you.
[46:03.54]Don't worry.
[46:03.96]I'm done with this place.
[46:04.76]I don't know where to go, but somewhere far away.
[46:06.38]Good luck.
[46:06.74]Maybe we'll see you another day.
[46:08.40]I don't think I'm going to make this place out alive.
[46:11.68]I will make it easy for them.
[46:14.04]Are you sure you want to give up your life for revenge?
[46:16.20]The last thing my brother asked me was to protect his daughter and his place.
[46:19.38]Yet in the end, she died protecting me instead.
[46:22.10]It is laughable.
[46:23.08]A little girl saving a samurai?
[46:24.77]There's only one way to repay them and regain my honor as samurai.
[46:28.81]I will avenge them, even if it's the last thing that I do.
[46:33.77]I understand.
[46:34.69]I won't say anything more.
[46:35.49]Just be careful.
[46:36.11]Farewell.
[46:36.47]Goodbye.
[46:36.91]Thank you, sir, for everything.
[46:37.93]Bye-bye.
[46:39.69]You're welcome.
[46:42.07]I'll be taking this, too.
[46:49.49]Alright.
[46:50.21]Find a boss with a health bar.
[46:51.65]And... wait.
[46:55.39]Alright, I had to pick it up.
[46:56.49]They didn't just hand it to me.
[47:00.97]Alright, so this key opens which door again?
[47:03.31]The garden door?
[47:04.21]The one all the way to the right?
[47:07.70]Like this one, right?
[47:15.46]They literally said it's on the table.
[47:19.04]Did they?
[47:25.34]Did they say that?
[47:26.36]I don't remember.
[47:36.75]They said it was on the house.
[47:38.37]Like on the roof?
[47:42.53]What?
[47:44.36]What the heck?
[47:45.84]Oh my god.
[47:53.02]Alright, don't die here.
[47:54.02]We're about to progress for the first time.
[47:56.26]We're about to actually progress a video game forward for the first time in two hours this stream.
[48:01.50]Aren't you guys excited?
[48:16.52]You use the key to unlock it.
[48:18.20]You've unlocked a piece of the map.
[48:19.66]Let's see.
[48:20.52]This place is huge.
[48:22.88]Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
[48:24.66]You only really need two or three dots there.
[48:29.64]After so many months, I finally have a chance to begin fulfilling my revenge.
[48:33.35]I need to find my way into the inner residence.
[48:35.25]Maybe I can find some supplies around that I can use apart from the keys to the inner buildings.
[48:39.39]And the guards will not hesitate to kill me at sight after all what happened, so I should be prepared to fight at any moment.
[48:47.85]Uh, was that?
[48:48.37]Yeah, it sure did just open up.
[48:50.89]This is huge.
[48:51.63]Yeah.
[48:52.87]It is huge.
[48:54.11]God.
[48:54.41]I'll take three hits on you.
[49:13.14]Don't do it.
[49:13.54]Don't do it.
[49:13.90]Don't do it.
[49:14.20]I'll do it.
[49:17.85]Oh, you fucking gonna just dance all around me.
[49:25.16]Message deleted.
[49:26.04]Message deleted.
[49:26.98]Message deleted.
[49:27.84]Message deleted.
[49:29.88]PictoPix waiting room.
[49:31.32]PictoPix waiting room, resident sleeper.
[49:33.30]PictoPix waiting room.
[49:43.26]God damn it.
[49:56.80]I'm not going to fuck it up this time.
[49:58.88]Yes, I am.
[49:59.48]Just restart.
[49:59.98]Kill me.
[50:01.85]No, I can get him in like one hit.
[50:36.71]I prefer PictoPix waiting room.
[50:39.43]Where is PictoPix?
[50:42.88]I will end this stream with PictoPix, I promise.
[50:44.78]I don't know.
[50:56.41]I can't do it.
[50:56.91]I don't have anything to sharpen.
[51:07.59]Okay, hold on.
[51:17.70]Finally, okay.
[51:18.70]I actually bought my parents' PictoPix because of you and they really like it.
[51:21.60]They're like 80.
[51:23.00]Your parents are not 80 years old.
[51:24.78]That would make you like 48.
[51:25.76]That would make you like 52 years old.
[51:29.53]Maybe you are.
[51:30.47]Then I'm just being an asshole and... I don't think your parents are 80 though.
[51:37.57]Parents of 80.
[51:38.23]That's fine.
[51:50.42]I'm glad you got your parents that game, because it's a very good game.
[51:55.50]It is so fun!
[51:58.21]I need a whetstone.
[52:08.48]Let's give it a try.
[52:11.22]Actually, not that bad.
[52:12.12]I can be a coward and just hit back.
[52:17.59]How much damage is that doing, though?
[52:18.67]I don't think it's doing very much.
[52:19.73]Actually, yeah, it is.
[52:20.27]Pretty good strat.
[52:29.35]I thought you were going to do Space Channel 5 based on your tweet.
[52:31.41]I actually thought we should change that tweet.
[52:36.16]Yeah, I need to change that tweet.
[52:38.39]Damn it.
[52:43.55]Save the game?
[52:44.25]I will.
[52:49.63]Let me get into the middle here.
[52:59.28]Can I go through the bushes here?
[53:02.80]No.
[53:06.91]Oops.
[53:08.23]Oops.
[53:08.75]Oops.
[53:09.31]Oops.
[53:09.85]Oops.
[53:16.53]Oops.
[53:23.68]Oh, fuck.
[53:29.12]What am I doing?
[53:29.72]What have I done?
[53:41.93]Okay, I'm fine.
[53:48.30]Shit, it's just like the entire zone is here!
[53:58.60]Ah!
[54:14.44]God damn it.
[54:17.84]Could've played that better.
[54:27.16]Yeah.
[54:28.14]I know.
[54:28.46]I know.
[54:44.44]Die.
[54:49.44]No whetstone.
[54:53.76]Can I save it now?
[54:54.88]I am.
[54:55.18]I have no health.
[54:58.00]I still love you, though.
[55:09.41]Nah, you guys are great.
[55:10.25]Thank you.
[55:12.82]No, even when I have, look at, look at, even when I have all these problems.
[55:17.17]And all this shit hits the fan on some streams.
[55:20.07]Look at this, there's 3,000 fucking people here.
[55:22.69]Seriously.
[55:35.58]Back up, back up, back up.
[55:36.90]Oh my, did I just get a headshot?
[55:41.32]We're here just to make fun of you.
[55:46.30]I've got to get through this area.
[55:53.32]There's a resident.
[55:54.04]It's alright.
[55:54.84]If you think the game's boring, that's alright.
[55:59.89]There'll be another one.
[56:01.65]Don't worry.
[56:02.03]There'll be another one.
[56:03.27]There'll be another stream.
[56:04.75]You'll see it again.
[56:05.93]It'll happen.
[56:11.42]I can't stint still.
[56:13.12]I gotta go after the guy with the bow first.
[56:17.39]Uh, I'd like you to target that guy.
[56:22.47]Now let's pull up the bow.
[56:27.02]PictoPic stream confirmed.
[56:28.60]Yeah, I told you I'm gonna do it.
[56:32.20]You have a bow too?
[56:32.94]What?
[56:34.02]I didn't even see you.
[56:42.56]Fucking swing at him.
[56:44.10]Whoa!
[56:46.63]Swing!
[56:47.21]Whoa!
[57:19.95]I got him.
[57:27.50]No, stop!
[57:28.20]Just hit him!
[57:28.64]He's got a bow!
[57:29.66]He's got a bow.
[57:30.40]You don't have to be concerned about the guy with the bow.
[57:32.42]Just go swing at him.
[57:40.66]Okay.
[57:42.69]Is this the streamer who died to bow guy?
[57:45.41]Yeah, it is.
[58:06.21]I need a shoppin' stone and I can't find one.
[58:14.98]Why doesn't that not fire?
[58:18.78]Um, video game.
[58:19.74]I'd like to fire a bow.
[58:20.68]Where am I?
[58:21.42]What's wrong with me?
[58:23.44]What am I stuck on?
[58:24.67]Did I... Oh, I put the... I... I... I... I... No, I wasn't stuck.
[58:31.29]I was queued up in a big slash.
[58:34.13]Had the bow put down.
[58:35.27]It's a...
[58:48.38]No, I don't need anything right now.
[58:50.00]I need a whetstone.
[58:50.62]That's actually important.
[58:59.11]Why did you put that away?
[59:01.99]I had an opportunity to make this right.
[59:09.27]Hold the... Hold left bumper up and then...
[59:18.17]Hold left bumper, down, up.
[59:23.43]Down.
[59:25.03]Why you guys doing that?
[59:39.52]I'm crying.
[59:53.72]Why did somebody just give $50?
[60:01.79]$50?
[60:01.81]50 bucks?
[60:07.21]For the technical difficulty stream?
[60:11.28]Thank you so much, regardless.
[60:15.50]Jerma, I heard you're feeling a bit under the weather the other day, so I figured I'd splurge a little to help you pay for your doctor's visit.
[60:20.06]Here's $5.
[60:21.10]You added too many zeros.
[60:30.42]But thank you.
[60:33.73]I really appreciate it.
[60:34.61]That's a lot of fucking money.
[60:36.73]I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
[60:43.29]Nobody said Jerm is running out of ideas.
[60:46.80]No, just the ideas that I chose to do today.
[60:48.88]Yeah, it didn't work out.
[60:51.62]I got plenty of ideas.
[60:52.52]Don't worry about that.
[61:02.23]I wish I didn't have a migraine.
[61:04.03]Cause that- Oh god.
[61:09.40]That was a big one.
[61:10.62]That was a big vroom.
[61:12.20]That was the biggest one we've had in a long time.
[61:18.04]That's gotta be, like, top five vrooms.
[61:24.91]Has to be.
[61:27.17]Uh, anyway, somebody just gave more money.
[61:32.04]Thank you, Juno Upsetto, for the five dollars.
[61:34.74]I mean... Fifty dollars.
[61:39.38]Fifty bucks back to back.
[61:40.66]Don't cry, Jeremy.
[61:41.46]Wipe your tears with these fifty dollars.
[61:44.02]Love you.
[61:48.91]Well, thank you guys for the insane amount of money.
[61:52.39]I gotta go save.
[61:57.63]But what I was gonna say is that... Oh, no.
[62:05.75]Let me get to the save point.
[62:12.53]I gotta kill this person first.
[62:17.21]I have to.
[62:17.55]What the hell am I doing?
[62:33.00]Okay.
[62:35.80]You have so much health!
[62:37.16]No, my weapon is broken!
[62:38.68]I had a broken fucking weapon!
[62:47.39]Ah!
[62:53.35]Okay.
[62:54.87]Uh, something-and-rother gave $50 too.
[62:59.20]Thank you for 50 bucks, something-and-rother.
[63:01.12]And you say, uh, oh no, my apple juice money.
[63:03.58]Do you remember Pluto?
[63:06.33]That's $150 from three different people.
[63:07.97]Thank you guys so much.
[63:08.69]And then five community subs from Magellan.
[63:13.73]Thank you so much, guys.
[63:15.79]And then there's $100 now.
[63:17.01]McCronda just gave $100.
[63:27.46]They say, Hey Jeremy, my allowance got bumped to $5 this week.
[63:31.50]I'm giving you $1 from it.
[63:33.16]Hope it helps, though it's not much.
[63:39.60]You guys really gotta check, you always make sure when you're checking out you have the right thing selected.
[63:46.70]But I do appreciate it nonetheless, you guys, that's a shitload of money.
[63:54.27]People are going bankrupt to make streamer happy.
[63:58.49]No, it's not a competition.
[64:01.71]To, you know, give money.
[64:05.47]That's a fucking lot, thank you guys.
[64:09.29]Such an absolute insane amount of money.
[64:12.05]That was the best $100 joke.
[64:13.99]Did I save it?
[64:14.63]I don't even remember.
[64:15.17]I'm going to go do it just in case.
[64:16.03]10 community subs from Bebraham.
[64:25.56]10 coming in.
[64:30.64]You guys, it's too much.
[64:32.58]Thank you, all of you.
[64:34.22]Oh, what is that?
[64:35.76]Is that one?
[64:36.15]That's all.
[64:36.49]Okay, that's just StreamLabs catching up.
[64:40.60]Jesus.
[64:43.02]But what I was gonna say is, this was supposed to be VR, but I've had awful fucking headaches the last couple of days, so I just couldn't get in that thing today, this week.
[64:57.53]So that's why I had to think of something else to do in the meantime.
[65:01.39]And Space Channel 5 has been around for a while.
[65:08.13]And I figured we'd try it, but you know, sometimes it just doesn't work.
[65:11.99]And that's all there is to it.
[65:12.73]And I'm gonna die.
[65:20.44]Let me clutch this right now.
[65:22.22]No, I'm not.
[65:25.56]How do I do the big spin?
[65:26.22]No, I'm dead.
[65:32.73]Smashly gave $50.
[65:34.53]Use this money to put a hit on the rumor.
[65:39.35]That's an insane amount of money.
[65:40.47]Thank you, guys.
[65:42.93]You guys are too generous to me.
[65:52.56]What's the name of the game?
[65:53.14]This game is called A Path to Die.
[65:59.04]And it really is not... It's not bad.
[66:01.39]It's not.
[66:02.59]It's interesting.
[66:05.87]I wouldn't be in it right now if I didn't think so.
[66:14.99]Somebody will get this and they'll beat it in like fucking 40 minutes and YouTube it.
[66:19.67]And it'll be like, holy shit, that guy beat this game in like 25 minutes.
[66:25.35]I just put the... Okay, that guy... These are the ones that cause so much trouble.
[66:34.12]Fuck.
[66:35.18]Alright, I gotta pee.
[66:49.88]I gotta pee.
[66:51.47]And when I get back after, let me try this another couple times.
[66:53.67]Okay, let me try this another two times to get, like, another save point.
[66:57.19]And then I'm gonna throw the towel in and play PictoPix for, like, three hours.
[67:03.31]That's probably what's gonna happen.
[67:07.10]More bits.
[67:08.10]What are you guys doing?
[67:16.45]Uh, Nateykins, thank you for the 50 bucks.
[67:22.41]Here's 5 cents, Germo.
[67:27.17]You guys, you guys have lost your minds today.
[67:32.32]Thank you.
[67:36.48]You guys are fucking way too generous.
[67:45.48]I need healing.
[67:47.04]That's the problem.
[67:50.80]No.
[67:51.28]Give me the bow.
[67:57.47]Okay.
[68:00.07]That's a nice dodge.
[68:00.79]I have six arrows.
[68:01.51]Let me get a full charge.
[68:03.41]Kill him one hit.
[68:06.47]That's close.
[68:12.10]He actually just Yoda'd that thing.
[68:21.59]Now I really am almost dead.
[68:32.10]Oops.
[68:36.60]Buy him an island.
[68:38.20]What am I gonna do with an island?
[68:46.30]Stream from the island.
[68:47.95]Hold competitions.
[68:51.91]This is gonna get real ugly if I do not get a sharpening stone.
[69:04.40]Survive on a desert island stream.
[69:08.48]Did I actually just miss?
[69:09.84]How embarrassing.
[69:13.34]That's an embarrassment.
[69:21.45]Aw, this is bad.
[69:28.35]Aw.
[69:29.77]Shameful display.
[69:36.55]Alright, last attempt, then I'm gonna go take a piss and we're gonna come back.
[69:40.36]And I'm gonna- and I'm gonna delete the VOD.
[69:42.52]No, I'm just kidding.
[69:54.09]How am I supposed to... Alright, here's my one gripe that I have with the game.
[69:59.68]So there's a mechanic where the weapon dulls.
[70:05.16]So you could be walking around with a useless weapon, but are there any other weapons to use?
[70:09.52]Because what happens if I don't find a whetstone here?
[70:18.17]I just lose.
[70:22.20]I have to hit the people two or three times as many times.
[70:37.27]Zero sharpness is 50% less damage.
[70:42.39]That sucks.
[70:54.67]I wouldn't call it a soft lock, I would just, I mean, it's hard to handle.
[71:00.41]I don't, I don't know, block?
[71:01.83]She went through that?
[71:07.77]Oh man, alright.
[71:08.61]Am I playing anything else?
[71:11.52]Yeah, I'm gonna just play PictoPicto, we're just gonna chill.
[71:18.74]It's a thrust, yeah, I have to like dodge the thrust.
[71:22.81]Because I really am just screwed.
[71:25.11]I need health.
[71:25.81]I need... My weapon is dull.
[71:27.79]I need to shoot that person with arrows.
[71:40.15]That's so much easier.
[71:40.83]Because I don't think they can block it.
[71:42.49]Oh my god.
[71:49.40]She can dodge it though.
[71:51.18]Very easily.
[71:52.12]And here comes the whole zone.
[71:54.24]Alright, I'll be right back.
[72:12.87]We're gonna reboot.
[72:13.87]We're gonna reboot the stream here.
[72:15.73]I'm just gonna come back and we're gonna play PictoPix and
[72:19.54]I'm gonna Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind this game.
[72:24.22]And then... No, that was fine.
[72:26.78]That game was interesting.
[72:30.35]Uh, that's another $50 from Communist Taco.
[72:35.23]Just came in right now, or a minute ago.
[72:38.07]Thank you, thank you, thank you for the fucking crazy amount of money.
[72:40.89]Hey, Jeremy, use this to buy the PS2 version of Space Channel 5.
[72:43.41]Uh-huh.
[72:50.58]I don't think it's 50 bucks.
[72:53.53]And I'm not sure I want to do that.
[72:57.95]But I'll be right back.
[72:58.95]Let me just grab some water.
[73:00.87]And we're going to hop into PictoPix.
[73:04.79]And we're just going to relax.
[73:05.75]I'm just going to be an old band for like three or four hours.
[73:12.14]Be right back.
