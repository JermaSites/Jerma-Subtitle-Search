[ve:60.16.100]

[00:30.69]What is happening?
[00:31.87]How are you?
[00:32.77]What is up?
[00:38.30]Do I have a treat for you tonight?
[00:47.52]So a very long time ago... I mentioned... That one day... One day... I would probably stream Chrono Trigger.
[01:00.74]Which is one of my favorite video games of all time.
[01:07.81]I have not played it in about 10 years.
[01:11.71]We talked about it two or three days ago.
[01:15.32]And it really just kind of got me like, let's do it.
[01:30.05]I would say over the years, you've probably heard me talk about this is probably top three, top five of all time.
[01:37.77]I think it comfortably sits at like four or five ever.
[01:43.67]Mario RPG is probably.
[01:45.13]Do you think Mario?
[01:49.87]I think it's probably lower.
[01:52.77]Mario RPG is probably like six.
[01:55.43]Chrono Trigger is probably like five or four.
[01:58.07]They're right next to each other, though.
[02:02.61]Actually finish this.
[02:03.37]Don't pull a sorcery.
[02:05.70]We are going to do this.
[02:08.76]For the next two or three days.
[02:11.64]I am here and I'm in it.
[02:14.20]We're going to see the ending credits.
[02:20.71]I'm not.
[02:21.17]This is not going to be Infinity Nikki.
[02:22.59]I'm not going to play this for like an hour and be like, yeah, see you like a fucking six months.
[02:28.93]But let's get the pre-rolls out of the way.
[02:31.63]Ads are going to play.
[02:32.65]I will be back and we're going to start with, ladies and gentlemen, one of my favorite games ever.
[02:44.88]Ladies and germs.
[02:51.60]Alright, ads are going to start.
[02:52.56]I'll be right back in about three or four minutes.
[02:55.38]Let's go.
[02:55.74]I'm going to set some ground rules too for all, you know, people that are coming in here.
[03:00.53]I'm going to set some ground rules for this game.
[03:01.87]Alright, be right back.
[03:05.33]Ads will start right now.
[07:15.63]Alright, seems like we are good.
[07:18.95]Welcome back.
[07:22.21]Are you guys ready?
[07:22.71]So here the ground rules.
[07:24.75]Here's how it's going to go.
[07:27.51]This is my favorite game in the top five conversation.
[07:33.98]If you if you if you don't really like this game.
[07:38.42]I don't give a shit, OK?
[07:41.14]That's the ground rules.
[07:43.56]Those are the ground rules today.
[07:47.13]If anybody has anything negative to say about this game... You're gonna catch a permanent ban.
[07:52.29]Forever.
[07:53.79]FOREVER.
[07:54.64]And it doesn't matter what the appeal is.
[07:57.22]You could say, oh, hey, man, I was just messing around.
[07:59.00]I think Chrono Trigger's kind of cool.
[08:00.86]You're gonna get a reply that says, I don't care.
[08:05.01]It stays.
[08:16.70]And here's the thing.
[08:18.32]I'm mainly fucking around.
[08:20.80]But there is no way that anybody's going to say this about this game.
[08:30.12]This is the Leonardo da Vinci of video games.
[08:34.90]So, don't worry.
[08:37.31]But actually, you know, all jokes aside, let's talk about this.
[08:40.49]I've wanted to for a long time show this game.
[08:43.11]There are probably people here that have never seen it.
[08:45.96]Probably not very many considering it.
[08:47.90]A lot of people here already have seen this game or played it themselves.
[08:51.69]But hey, if you've never seen it before.
[08:54.85]Please ask chat to not spam Vinny.
[08:57.11]Wait, why?
[08:58.01]Why were you spamming Vinny?
[09:02.88]Leave Vinny alone.
[09:03.90]What?
[09:06.40]Somebody already tried getting me into this game.
[09:09.26]Vinny loves this game.
[09:11.19]Well, I mean, do you need any more evidence for why Vinny is one of the most based individual?
[09:17.87]Ever?
[09:18.73]Hey.
[09:22.16]Yeah, no, people don't spam Vinny because I'm playing that.
[09:25.70]This is, hey, leave Vinny alone.
[09:27.68]Vinny loves the frog.
[09:31.34]Hey, who do you think my favorite character is too?
[09:36.29]Hey, don't spoil it though.
[09:37.49]There's people here that may have never even seen it.
[09:41.29]I got two favorite characters.
[09:42.42]Actually, three.
[09:49.02]You'll have to find out.
[09:50.06]We're gonna chill play through.
[09:51.20]There's a lot of things that can happen in this game and I... I don't remember a lot.
[09:56.14]I remember very broad strokes.
[09:57.60]It's been about 10 years.
[09:58.48]Maybe like 8 years since I played it last.
[10:02.39]And I usually played the Super Nintendo version.
[10:06.23]So there are cutscenes... I've seen the cutscenes before, but it's cool that they're in this... they're in this version.
[10:13.57]Can we complain about your play style?
[10:16.64]yeah I mean that's fine I mean you're still you're still gonna get permanently banned but you can still complain about it alright hold on let me just like retract it I think people are gonna be afraid to talk today uh no you're good I'm just this is what we're doing for the next couple of days so hey if you want to chill that's what we're going to do there's not going to be like uh fart in my ass simulator today okay
[10:51.54]And by the way, when was the last time I even played that game?
[10:55.02]I haven't played fart in my ass simulator in probably like three years.
[11:01.75]He's clip farming.
[11:03.73]You can't clip farm on the intro to a stream.
[11:07.27]It's grayed out.
[11:08.83]It's literally grayed out.
[11:09.59]You can't.
[11:09.87]Alright, you guys ready?
[11:15.59]I'm ready to go.
[11:18.61]There it is.
[11:19.15]Oh my God, it's been so long.
[11:20.55]Chrono Trigger.
[11:26.72]sound effect by the way the music in this game is is as high as you can possibly get it's pretty much a full 10 out of 10. uh every single scene has a sound as a the OST is is the best in history alright let's go I'm gonna do again I'm not gonna do the new updated graphics because I actually don't like it oh whoopsie daisy hold on go back
[11:57.73]And you know what?
[11:58.23]Let's watch this too.
[12:18.86]Should I let the intro play?
[12:20.45]It's got a lot of spoilers in it, but like, does it really matter?
[12:23.19]Should we let the intro?
[12:23.83]What do you think?
[12:24.29]Intro?
[12:35.80]I'm actually really happy to do this.
[12:37.37]I'm so excited about this.
[12:46.57]There's only spoilers if you understand them.
[12:52.93]Ah, this game is gonna be sick.
[12:58.17]Oh, that's the X move!
[12:59.15]I know that move.
[13:06.06]I'm not too smart.
[13:07.10]I won't be spoiled.
[13:10.56]This actually is one of the RPGs that does one of my favorite types of RPG, which is there's no random battles.
[13:20.83]Random battles suck.
[13:22.37]I hate them.
[13:23.21]I've always hated them.
[13:24.63]You have to actually touch an enemy.
[13:26.93]You have to actually go near them to actually fight.
[13:30.33]So if it's got random battles, I don't really like it.
[13:37.70]Yeah, some of you might be noticing, this is Akira Toriyama.
[13:42.97]That's one of the best moves in the whole game, by the way.
[13:47.75]Alright, let's pull out.
[13:48.65]Let's pull out.
[13:49.07]Pull out.
[13:49.35]I don't want to see anymore.
[13:54.32]I'm ready.
[13:54.78]I needed to hype myself up a little bit.
[13:58.63]Actually, I did this the other day with Holly sitting next to me and she ripped, she ripped her head over.
[14:03.81]She was like, what?
[14:05.51]She's like, you don't deserve the ox at the party.
[14:07.21]I'm like, what, what?
[14:08.89]She's like, you, you, we were listening to like a song and I ripped the cord out like within like 15 seconds, 20 seconds left.
[14:19.43]Alright, let's go.
[14:20.73]New game.
[14:22.80]Yeah, there's not a whole lot of buttons.
[14:26.46]And why is... I'm using an Xbox controller, so okay.
[14:28.86]Yep.
[14:29.54]All that's good.
[14:31.89]I want original graphics.
[14:34.31]We do not want the new graphics.
[14:35.85]It just blurs the pixels.
[14:37.85]And I think it looks like shit.
[14:40.03]I want original Super Nintendo graphics, and I want the active battle mode, because I want to be able to be on my feet and be quick.
[14:50.61]Here we go.
[14:52.61]That's a boomer take.
[14:54.57]That's fine.
[14:57.13]Is this a DS?
[14:58.17]This is the Steam version.
[14:59.43]And I know somebody just puked.
[15:01.41]Let's go.
[15:03.21]I keep all their names exactly the same.
[15:05.42]I'm not, we don't like headcanon these characters as different people.
[15:09.86]That's Chrono.
[15:11.02]That is Chrono.
[15:12.32]That's not like Billy.
[15:15.10]No, that's Chrono.
[15:33.60]Yeah.
[15:37.52]This is gonna be awesome.
[15:38.56]I'm so excited for this.
[15:39.40]It's been a long time since I've played it.
[15:41.64]I might actually start crying at some of these parts.
[15:44.74]And I'm not even kidding, by the way.
[15:46.09]Real men cry to Chrono Trigger.
[15:48.59]Hey, go ahead.
[15:49.19]Put that in your fucking Tinder bio, by the way.
[15:51.13]Real men cry to Chrono Trigger.
[15:56.23]Crono?
[15:56.41]Crono?
[15:57.63]Crono, are you still sleeping?
[15:59.95]Come on, sleepyhead, it's time to get up.
[16:11.41]Dear me, I'd forgotten how beautiful Lynn's bell sounds.
[16:17.95]You must have been so excited about the Millennial Fair that you couldn't sleep last night, could you?
[16:24.16]Well, you better not let that giddiness get you into any trouble.
[16:26.59]I want you to behave yourself today.
[16:33.77]Come on now, out of bed with you.
[16:40.50]Alright.
[16:43.84]And yes, that is a cat, and the cat is your friend.
[16:53.45]Can't go back to bed.
[16:56.81]It's about time, by the way, you're about to go see.
[17:04.40]Oh dear, what was her name?
[17:05.42]That young, adventurous friend of yours?
[17:08.84]Luca.
[17:10.50]We're keeping it Luca.
[17:11.20]Have you played this before?
[17:17.26]Oh, yes, I have.
[17:19.66]Yes, yes, yes.
[17:20.32]This is one of my favorite games ever made.
[17:24.79]That's right, Luca.
[17:25.73]You're going to stop by and see her new invention at the fair, aren't you?
[17:30.01]Well, run along then.
[17:30.77]Be back before dinner.
[17:37.04]First party member.
[17:39.42]A house cat.
[17:42.88]You can build up a ton of crit with a house cat, and it gives synergy with frog later.
[17:47.48]I don't think it's the best character in the game, but it's one of the best.
[17:55.49]I love this little cat.
[17:56.27]It's the best little cat.
[17:57.33]Okay, cool.
[17:59.21]Oh, I almost forgot.
[17:59.83]Here's your allowance, dear.
[18:01.19]Have fun at the fair.
[18:03.63]You obtain 200 G. You can forget to do that.
[18:07.75]I'm glad I didn't.
[18:08.31]Okay, back before dinner.
[18:10.79]I'm going to go to the fair.
[18:11.45]We're going to have fun at the fair.
[18:15.63]Music's a little loud.
[18:16.49]I'm going to let that one slide.
[18:20.76]But going forward, that's a permanent ban.
[18:27.24]So here's the fair up here.
[18:31.18]Is the music actually a little too loud?
[18:33.00]Should I turn it down a little bit?
[18:40.40]Is it alright?
[18:41.26]Maybe like a tad?
[18:42.44]Alright, let's do like a tad.
[18:46.83]How's that?
[18:48.21]Better?
[18:53.53]I'm not going right to the fair.
[18:58.98]You got any stuff in your house?
[18:59.68]Forget Some people have stuff in their house
[19:29.37]Exposition talk, my beloved.
[19:34.91]The neighbor, okay.
[19:36.95]We can just go right to the fair, but I like kind of... I'm taking it in for a minute.
[19:43.31]Welcome, welcome.
[19:43.85]Make yourself at home.
[19:44.53]I suppose you won't be staying long, though.
[19:46.76]Oh, I hope my shift ends soon.
[19:48.06]I want to go to the fair, too.
[19:55.24]Say, can you spare ten gold to buy me a drink?
[19:58.46]Yeah.
[19:59.83]Thanks.
[20:00.11]Let me play you a song in return.
[20:01.64]What does she play?
[20:05.94]Ooh.
[20:15.97]That's a good one.
[20:23.27]That's a good one.
[20:27.66]Lodging is 10 gold.
[20:28.54]Would you like to stay for the night?
[20:29.96]Uh, no.
[20:30.44]I got full health.
[20:35.95]How does she make those sounds on the piano?
[20:38.89]That's true.
[20:39.29]Alright, we're supposed to go to the fair.
[20:41.87]We're going to be home before dinner.
[20:42.71]Let's go.
[20:43.01]We're going to the fair.
[20:45.67]This song's a banger, by the way.
[20:51.03]Alright, we gotta make money here.
[20:52.21]Alright, so... Let's get some tickets.
[21:17.34]I hear Luca and her father have put together another crazy invention.
[21:19.95]I just hope it doesn't blow up again like the last one.
[21:23.47]Yeah, it is Gambo.
[21:28.63]Come one, come all to the Tent of Horrors.
[21:30.33]Spend your silver points here.
[21:31.59]Put your bravery to the test.
[21:33.52]Let me check how many points you have.
[21:35.02]Zero.
[21:36.12]Well, this is as good a place as any to spend them.
[21:40.02]Alright, I need some points.
[21:44.20]Because this is a test of strength machine.
[21:45.76]Yep.
[21:48.26]Line up with the bell and press the button when you're ready.
[21:50.64]Judge your distance carefully, then press A once more.
[21:52.72]Fuck.
[22:02.25]And go.
[22:03.75]One- Oh, that's right.
[22:04.77]You have to do this a lot.
[22:10.66]I'll do it ten times.
[22:12.22]And then we're gonna go bad on the race.
[22:20.67]This is just like Stardew Valley.
[22:23.71]I would imagine that Stardew probably took a lot of inspiration from the old SNES RPGs, judging by the way it looks right off the bat.
[22:32.92]I would say this, what, Secret of Mana is another one that was, had that exact kind of style back in the day.
[22:37.82]Alright, what do I have, seven points?
[22:41.55]Alright, how much do I have?
[22:53.16]Okay, I can buy potion, uh, status ailments, shelter.
[22:58.00]Um, I'm gonna get a couple of these.
[23:01.43]I feel like it's probably not a bad idea to get a few of these.
[23:07.97]What do I have for stuff?
[23:14.86]Wooden sword.
[23:15.94]I got nothing.
[23:22.09]Ooh, padded vest.
[23:26.30]I'll get the vest.
[23:36.74]Dude, I don't think I've ever bought this.
[23:38.90]Like, that's 15 times I've played this game.
[23:45.35]I don't think I've ever purchased this.
[23:50.19]This is Lean Square.
[23:51.37]Legend has it that people who hear Lean's Bell live happily ever after.
[23:54.33]I'll take a look.
[24:00.14]Oh, shit.
[24:00.36]Okay, I need... I want some money.
[24:01.34]Two voices, Andy!
[24:18.84]Alright, I'm gonna make a bet.
[24:19.92]Oh, the alien one.
[24:20.58]Cat.
[24:20.70]Alien.
[24:20.82]Night.
[24:49.92]Alright, let's do it.
[24:51.90]The last race was Green Ambler.
[24:53.58]Alright, let's guess the next one.
[24:58.48]The cat.
[25:05.20]Did I do it?
[25:13.86]Come on, cat.
[25:14.22]Let's go.
[25:15.89]Come on.
[25:20.48]no oh hold on hold on it's not over no I'm doing cat again did you block them see when I was younger I used to do the I used to do the race too yeah okay cat alright let's do the thing I did when I was like 14 ready
[26:00.94]yes I think you get some points for it yeah I did it nice job okay you were right I put 20 silver points oh my god alright let's do it again uh I'm gonna say yeah the the knight steel runner
[26:32.47]I think you can get a crazy item if you actually... I think I got it again.
[26:36.73]Uh, I think you get a crazy item if you have, like, 500 points.
[26:39.39]I don't remember.
[26:42.71]Also, this is not on an emulator or anything, so I have no save states, so we gotta be... Oh, shit.
[26:51.87]So, whatever decisions I make are decisions I have to live with.
[26:58.21]So, this is on Steam, this is not on an emulator.
[27:05.95]Alright, same person.
[27:07.15]Steal the knight.
[27:15.28]This blue guy just wins every race.
[27:18.82]Is the Steam version good?
[27:21.90]I don't know the answer to that question.
[27:24.62]I really don't.
[27:25.74]I know that the Steam version is a port of the DS version, which is a port of a different version, which is a PlayStation version.
[27:33.34]I don't know.
[27:37.97]I had to do a couple of little tweaks to make this run a little better.
[27:40.57]Because it ran kind of like shit before I had to force some stuff with the NVIDIA GPU launcher.
[27:45.31]Alright, what do I got here?
[27:50.39]Alright.
[27:51.49]Spend your silver points here.
[27:52.63]Put your bravery to the test.
[27:54.23]I have 29 silver points.
[27:59.18]Oh, I love this one.
[28:00.40]Alright.
[28:01.34]This guy is kind of scary.
[28:04.00]And let me see if I can get his voice before you hear it.
[28:13.61]Kind of close.
[28:24.11]How many silver points would you like to spend?
[28:26.97]Ten.
[28:32.44]I'm Biggs.
[28:34.32]I'm Wedge.
[28:36.16]I'm Piet.
[28:39.82]Oh shit, I already don't know anything.
[28:44.27]Which one is P... I don't know.
[28:46.09]I have no idea.
[28:52.67]Oh shit, it's right in the middle.
[28:53.59]I got it.
[28:55.22]Oh, you got me!
[28:57.38]It's a Puyozo doll.
[28:58.60]It'll spruce up your room.
[28:59.84]Cool.
[29:02.24]Nice.
[29:02.52]Alright, we have to get 40... This is gonna be like a 100-hour playthrough, by the way.
[29:09.49]I want more points.
[29:16.00]Those runners are busy racing, so they won't answer you if you talk to them.
[29:18.54]You should be thankful things are so peaceful now.
[29:40.73]Oh, who's that?
[30:04.27]Yum.
[30:04.59]You feel refreshed.
[30:06.61]Oh, fuck.
[30:07.37]Right.
[30:07.65]I forgot about that.
[30:09.31]Oops.
[30:10.41]I actually just fucked up the playthrough.
[30:16.74]My dear old wife.
[30:17.86]That's not a joke, by the way.
[30:19.78]People go, what are you talking about?
[30:20.80]Just wait.
[30:21.42]I fucked up the whole playthrough.
[30:23.44]My dear old wife made that lunch for me.
[30:25.44]Always the highlight of my day.
[30:26.62]Gives me that extra oomph when I'm starting to feel worn down.
[30:31.20]No, I gotta live with it.
[30:32.44]I have to live with it.
[30:47.20]Yeah, my kitty ran away.
[30:48.56]Alright, we're gonna get the cat.
[31:03.07]Where'd the cat go?
[31:08.78]Oh no, that's the other cat.
[31:20.82]I think you have to be very, very careful.
[31:39.17]See, we're doing a good deed.
[31:40.07]You brought my kitty.
[31:45.47]Thank you.
[31:45.91]I did it.
[31:51.02]Oh, this is the button mash, right?
[31:52.16]Alright, drinking contest.
[31:53.12]Step right up.
[31:53.54]Press A as fast as you can.
[31:55.06]I'm gonna nail this.
[31:57.27]Ready?
[32:06.21]There's not even any room.
[32:07.15]I drank them all.
[32:12.13]Five silver points?
[32:13.01]Wait, I can just do this like a hundred times.
[32:27.40]Okay, so 5, 10.
[32:27.98]I need 40.
[32:34.90]How fast do you actually have to even press this?
[32:36.58]I was pressing it way too fast.
[32:39.81]Can you even hear this?
[32:41.01]I'm doing it a tenth of the speed I was just doing it.
[32:54.32]On the SNES you have to mash it.
[32:57.05]I remember it being a lot harder on the original version.
[33:02.07]Didn't you throw your controller at the TV when you played this for the first time?
[33:07.71]No?
[33:09.88]Did I throw this at the TV?
[33:11.92]I don't think I did.
[33:15.84]I think you're thinking of the Metal Gear Solid torture sequence.
[33:21.25]Because that one actually like hurt your arm and it was almost impossible.
[33:28.86]I remember friends of mine back in the day would get to that point and they knew that I was a fucking weirdo that could mash buttons really fast.
[33:35.03]And then they'd be like, hey, can you come over and mash so I can beat that sequence?
[33:53.56]The rapid fire controllers, yeah.
[33:55.78]You could flick the button, the turbo, and it would just go... Metal Gear Solid 2 mashing was hell.
[34:09.66]Old mashing was so... It really was.
[34:12.68]That's why they could sell the controllers to do it for you.
[34:15.42]Alright, how many points do I have at least?
[34:22.09]I wanted 40.
[34:27.08]Cool.
[34:28.26]Oh, can't you dance?
[34:31.42]Prehistoric dance.
[34:32.59]Entrancing, isn't it?
[34:36.39]Catch a rhythm, huh?
[34:37.05]You can dance along with A, B, R, B, L, B. Okay.
[34:57.21]it was weird to see chrono emote because he's very much silent protagonist the whole game so seeing him do this is weird oh prehistoric rhythm I was worn out from running around but watching this dance gives me energy
[35:31.59]How many silver?
[35:32.37]Okay, 64 silver points.
[35:36.19]No, I want to go spend them.
[35:43.53]Go straight ahead if you want to try your hand against Luca's bipedal robot battler, Gato.
[35:48.65]You can win silver points if you beat him.
[35:50.07]Oh yeah, that's right.
[35:50.55]There's like a tutorial.
[35:53.23]Got a great song too.
[35:55.57]They call me Gato.
[35:56.35]I have metal joints.
[35:57.09]If you can beat me up, you're in 15 points.
[36:00.70]Here comes one of the best songs in the game, by the way.
[36:16.87]So the bottom bar is the speed.
[36:19.05]So when that fills, I get to do something.
[36:21.45]This is real time, so there is no... you wait for anybody to do something.
[36:25.81]If you are faster, you actually get to do more attacks.
[36:39.12]I was gonna say, is he gonna kill me?
[36:47.98]Oh no, I have lost.
[36:48.74]It seems you have won.
[36:49.48]Here are your 15 points.
[36:51.22]That wasn't that fun.
[36:55.78]Ding!
[37:04.12]His lunch is back!
[37:16.08]Okay.
[37:16.98]I have 79 points.
[37:18.00]Should I do the- I'm gonna do the 40 one.
[37:20.11]What is the 40 one?
[37:30.14]Eat it twice?
[37:33.40]That's a raid from Limealicious.
[37:35.20]Thanks, Lime.
[37:37.06]Welcome, everybody.
[37:39.81]We're doing Chrono Trigger.
[37:41.96]It is a completely blind playthrough, but it's not because this is one of my favorite games ever made.
[37:48.86]So it is a new, blind, 10-year-old kind of playthrough.
[37:56.81]Yeah, welcome.
[37:58.15]Welcome to the stream.
[37:59.15]We just started, so you're just in time.
[38:01.43]Okay, 40 points.
[38:10.63]This is a nostalgia run.
[38:11.93]It actually is going to be a huge nostalgia run because, like I said, after 10 years, your brain sort of just writes over the information.
[38:20.39]So I'm down.
[38:22.89]Alright.
[38:23.09]40.
[38:23.73]This is a big one.
[38:26.99]Mimic what you see.
[38:28.07]Oh, shit.
[38:28.51]I have to actually pay attention.
[38:29.80]And there's no save state either.
[38:33.22]Alright.
[38:33.48]This is Super Nintendo.
[38:36.56]Wait, is this
[38:40.26]Hold on, is that Super Nintendo controls or is that my Xbox controls?
[38:47.98]Because X is not in the right spot.
[38:52.06]It's Xbox?
[38:52.60]Okay.
[38:53.82]So X is left arm.
[38:56.10]A is right arm.
[38:56.84]So that's right, left, laugh, surprise.
[39:01.51]Left, right, laugh, surprise.
[39:04.19]Left, right, laugh, surprise.
[39:09.14]Wait, his left or my left?
[39:16.92]What the fuck?
[39:17.56]That was completely incorrect.
[39:18.90]That's not the right one.
[39:21.98]What?
[39:22.24]I don't think it's for Xbox.
[39:31.04]Because I just pressed the button to laugh and it raised the left arm.
[39:34.50]It is SNES.
[39:38.04]Shit.
[39:41.16]Do I have enough points to do it?
[39:42.12]Let me get one more point.
[39:59.30]Shit.
[39:59.52]Okay, I got 40 now.
[40:14.65]Okay, so all I have to do is I have to swap.
[40:18.44]Oh man, this is going to be kind of weird.
[40:19.70]There's an actual save file, though.
[40:26.22]I think the save point is, there's a cutscene that's up there, and I think you kind of just have to do it afterwards, right?
[40:35.95]Whatever, I'll do it.
[40:36.53]I've got to lock in.
[40:38.68]Okay.
[40:39.14]X is left arm.
[40:40.98]A is right arm.
[40:43.04]I think it's... Hold on a second.
[40:47.08]No, no.
[40:47.46]This is... This is correct.
[40:52.02]Alright.
[40:52.66]I got it this time.
[40:53.80]Left, right, laugh, surprise.
[40:56.08]Left, right, laugh, surprise.
[40:57.46]Left, right, laugh, surprise.
[40:58.72]Left, right, laugh, surprise.
[41:00.50]Left, right, laugh, surprise.
[41:50.70]Yes!
[42:01.11]Did I lose?
[42:04.19]I pressed it.
[42:04.69]I pressed it.
[42:05.13]I pressed it.
[42:05.53]I swear to God, I pressed it.
[42:06.39]I mashed it.
[42:07.85]What?
[42:09.15]No, it wasn't too slow.
[42:10.19]I did it immediately.
[42:11.90]By the way, that was like a surprise 10 times in a row.
[42:16.32]Fuck, I need more points.
[42:18.66]What?
[42:18.92]I did it perfectly.
[42:20.16]I crushed it.
[42:24.32]The last one was like the same frame, so it didn't count.
[42:27.98]Fuck!
[42:29.32]No!
[42:30.44]I need 80 points!
[42:31.64]I'm just doing this 40 times.
[42:35.46]You ever think you'd watch a playthrough of Chrono Trigger in 2025?
[42:37.68]They've got an hour at the lean fair.
[42:42.30]Hey, that's just how I do it, okay?
[42:45.85]That's just how I do.
[42:53.13]Hey, that's just how I do.
[42:54.53]Yeah, that's what I do.
[43:11.39]Can I have like a new phrase this year?
[43:13.13]That's what I do.
[43:21.13]No, no, that's not going to work.
[43:26.29]It's gonna work.
[43:28.17]I'm gonna make it work.
[43:36.44]That's what I do.
[43:37.42]Sorry, no, your 2025 phrase is... Oh!
[43:43.73]Ooh!
[43:45.23]That sucks that that's correct.
[43:55.43]Alright, how many do I have?
[43:56.07]20?
[43:56.09]I think I'm just going right to 80.
[44:02.96]What's the best way to get?
[44:03.68]Okay, the best way to get points is to just mash.
[44:07.88]What do I have?
[44:12.92]20?
[44:12.94]21?
[44:14.40]I'm gonna just chug for 10 straight minutes.
[44:17.87]Yeah, I know, I'm avoiding the cutscene.
[44:21.25]Trust me, it's important.
[44:22.39]I need 100% completion.
[44:38.85]What is the 80.1?
[44:39.27]I don't remember.
[44:43.67]Gato's best for points?
[44:45.35]I feel like it's this because by the time it's 15 for Gato.
[44:48.63]And this is 5 every like 10 seconds?
[44:54.60]Why are you min-maxing the tutorial area?
[44:59.42]It's just what I do.
[45:15.37]It's, hey, it's, I like that.
[45:16.99]So he said, it's what I -2.
[45:19.04]Alright, let's just, oh, hold on.
[45:32.55]This pie looks delicious.
[45:33.73]Oh, well, nothing could happen, Jay.
[45:34.87]Somebody just erratically walked in.
[45:36.89]Oh!
[45:40.99]Ow!
[45:44.83]I'm so sorry, are you okay?
[45:47.53]The bell!
[45:48.95]Guys!
[45:49.53]Guys!
[45:50.05]Guys, the bell!
[45:50.69]Remember what that girl said?
[45:52.13]The little girl?
[45:53.37]Guys!
[45:53.67]Uh-oh, my pendant.
[46:06.08]Oh, thank goodness, my pendant.
[46:07.34]I know it doesn't look like much, but it has a lot of sentimental value.
[46:11.63]May I have it back?
[46:12.87]No.
[46:14.59]Mine.
[46:16.89]You didn't talk to her first?
[46:19.75]I really am fucking up that whole scene, aren't I?
[46:23.12]Whatever.
[46:23.64]It's a nostalgia playthrough.
[46:24.76]Who gives a shit?
[46:26.80]Oh, by the way, was that a game complaint?
[46:28.50]Permanently banned that person.
[46:30.98]You must live in this town.
[46:31.84]I came to see the fair.
[46:33.22]Awfully boring wandering around alone, though, isn't it?
[46:36.12]Why don't we walk around together for a while?
[46:37.70]Wouldn't that be great?
[46:44.50]Yahoo!
[46:45.08]This'll be fun!
[46:48.22]Oh, I never told you my name, did I?
[46:50.12]It's, uh, um... Marle.
[47:03.43]And you're... Crono!
[47:05.83]What a nice name!
[47:07.23]Well, pleased to meet you, Crono.
[47:08.67]Come on, let's enjoy the fair.
[47:09.93]I have to ask everybody a question.
[47:15.00]Is naming your son Crono in real life?
[47:21.42]Is that, is that, uh, is that cringe?
[47:25.38]That'd be probably really cringe, right?
[47:35.31]New party member.
[47:35.97]Okay.
[47:37.67]Does she chug?
[47:39.51]I think she might.
[47:40.03]Hold on.
[47:45.31]Oh, wait.
[47:46.05]Actually, I think she's disgusted by this.
[47:48.63]I think I'm doing everything wrong.
[47:54.35]Not bad.
[47:55.05]Five silver points.
[47:57.80]You're awfully competitive, aren't you, Chrono?
[48:00.66]Yeah, did you see what I did?
[48:01.74]I got a cat.
[48:02.68]I brought this cat back for this little girl.
[48:04.14]Did you know that I did that?
[48:05.76]You brought back my kitty.
[48:07.08]Thank you!
[48:09.54]You're so sweet.
[48:10.22]Yeah.
[48:11.27]What else did I do?
[48:12.63]I ate an old guy's lunch that his wife made for him.
[48:16.84]And I laughed about it, but we don't have to talk about that.
[48:33.63]Oh no, Chrono's about to die.
[48:35.27]Chrono's gonna die at the fair.
[48:37.45]Is that even possible?
[48:42.17]Oh shit.
[48:43.27]Oh shit, hold on.
[48:44.17]It's okay, Marle's got it.
[48:55.70]This is a cooked ending?
[48:57.74]No, Marle's got it.
[48:58.68]Marle's good.
[49:01.82]I thought you heal after doing this.
[49:04.16]I didn't know you didn't heal you.
[49:05.46]Crit.
[49:08.76]Yeah.
[49:16.62]Isn't it pronounced Marley?
[49:30.90]Uh, I've always said Marl.
[49:31.94]I'm seeing a lot of nos.
[49:37.35]I'm seeing a couple of yeses, though.
[49:38.59]Okay, I need to eat something.
[49:47.58]How many points do I have now?
[49:57.10]Alright, 66 points.
[49:58.92]I'm gonna try it again, and if I fuck it up again, I'm just gonna move on.
[50:12.19]Don't fuck it up.
[50:13.35]I'm not gonna mess it up.
[50:14.93]Left, right, laugh, surprise.
[50:16.95]Left, right, laugh, surprise.
[51:01.38]What the fuck?
[51:06.44]Dude, okay.
[51:07.50]Let me just tell you something.
[51:09.29]The inputs weren't registering.
[51:11.45]I had to press it like three times on a couple of those.
[51:13.67]Did you see what happened?
[51:14.45]It was like... That was really... I think that... I don't know the communication between this.
[51:19.94]You saw that happen.
[51:22.50]Like, I... I actually had to press it two to three times at least on a few of those.
[51:30.87]It's the fucking port.
[51:32.13]It's the port.
[51:32.73]It's the port problem.
[51:35.39]That input was fucked up.
[51:36.91]And I wish I had a hand camera so you could see it.
[51:47.57]Like, go back and watch that and you see that it's like... Like, I was like, why the fuck is it not registering?
[51:53.11]And I ended up just mashing it.
[51:54.17]And then it finally did.
[51:54.95]It registered twice.
[51:56.69]What a bunch of fucking dog shit.
[52:05.71]Okay.
[52:05.81]I need the health.
[52:06.27]I don't care, I already did it.
[52:07.31]Oh wait, she's here.
[52:08.77]You're such a pig, Crono.
[52:38.83]I don't even care.
[52:39.51]What do you even get for doing this?
[52:46.99]What do you get for the 80 points?
[52:48.33]I'm telling you, I need to do it on the keyboard.
[52:57.85]Preparation is still underway.
[52:58.75]Enjoy yourself in the square for a little while.
[53:00.47]How do you... Actually, I should probably buy some stuff.
[53:08.74]A hundred and... Oh, LucasDevice is all set up now.
[53:15.34]Just go straight to the back of the square.
[53:16.46]This is Lean Square.
[53:20.18]Legend has it that people who hear Lean's bell live happily ever after.
[53:22.78]Ah, I'm having a great time with you, Chrono.
[53:26.02]Alright, let's go.
[53:36.15]Just a minute, I want to get some candy.
[53:46.23]Don't move during this!
[53:53.20]Yeah, if you actually move around, then you failed it.
[54:00.01]I remember that.
[54:01.39]If you get impatient and walk away, she goes, Hey!
[54:11.87]Step right up.
[54:13.55]Any with the time and courage are first ever hypodimensional.
[54:17.24]This transpotter is the invention of- Why can't I talk?
[54:22.84]Simply hop up here.
[54:25.99]And you'll be teleported here.
[54:28.83]This fantastic machine is the masterwork of my beautiful and brilliant daughter, Luca.
[54:41.30]What does teleport mean?
[54:44.00]This contraption is supposed to transport objects in the blink of an eye.
[54:49.70]Luca invented this thing?
[54:50.64]I wonder what will go wrong this time.
[54:54.68]Give it a try, kid!
[54:55.61]Oh, it's you, Crono!
[54:59.45]Crono!
[55:00.91]I was wondering when you'd show up.
[55:02.65]No one wants to try my telepod.
[55:04.77]Would you be so kind?
[55:07.53]Well, this would be fun.
[55:08.27]I'll watch while you try it out.
[55:12.77]Just hop onto the left pod.
[55:20.95]System activated.
[55:21.63]Initiating energy transfer.
[55:29.70]Whoa, it worked.
[55:33.28]Ooh, amazing.
[55:34.54]Whoa.
[55:37.46]Wow.
[55:40.47]How was it?
[55:40.77]Wanna try again?
[55:41.29]Do it again.
[55:49.53]Nice, it worked.
[55:56.87]You're forever changed.
[56:03.22]It's alright, isn't it, Chrono?
[56:04.18]Just wait right here.
[56:06.86]Don't run off on me.
[56:17.00]Hee hee.
[56:17.26]Okay, I'll be right back.
[56:18.12]No way, I'm not afraid.
[56:18.90]Okay, everyone, let's give her a great big hand when she teleports from the platform.
[56:25.66]System activated.
[56:46.66]Initiating energy transfer.
[56:50.88]Oh.
[56:58.57]What's happening?
[56:59.71]My pendant, it's... Oh, shit.
[57:05.07]Huh?
[57:14.74]She just got obliterated into a million pieces.
[57:32.77]Look out, she's not reappearing.
[57:36.74]Well, alright, as you can see, the girl has vanished before your very eyes!
[57:41.74]Show's over, folks, move along now.
[57:53.18]The way she disappeared, that couldn't have been the telepod.
[57:56.86]The way that rift appeared, and the way her pendant seemed to be reacting to it, something else must have caused it.
[58:02.24]Human-cyborg relations.
[58:03.28]I fucking see 3PS in my head.
[58:08.20]Well, what are we supposed to do now?
[58:09.42]Is there any way we can help her?
[58:10.38]That girl's face was so familiar.
[58:14.10]I know I've seen her somewhere.
[58:23.87]Send me.
[58:26.56]Crono?
[58:28.66]Oh, you're going after her.
[58:29.92]What a fine lad.
[58:33.00]It's the only way.
[58:33.92]I don't know where that hole leads, but we've got no other choice.
[58:36.06]Let's just hope it opens up again.
[58:38.92]Well, it's worth a shot.
[58:40.98]That pendant seems to be the key, so hang on to it, Crono.
[58:43.15]Embrace yourself!
[58:46.37]Just deactivated.
[58:50.77]Initiating energy transfer.
[58:53.56]Boost the power output.
[58:55.78]Roger.
[58:58.99]More!
[59:00.13]I need more power!
[59:01.33]More!
[59:05.45]There, I think we did it.
[59:08.47]More!
[59:14.48]Good luck, Chrono.
[59:15.20]I'll follow you as soon as I figure out what went wrong.
[59:23.64]Oh, dude, this is so trippy.
[59:25.12]Is this a double homicide?
[59:36.51]Alright, where am I?
[59:46.39]What the heck?
[59:47.19]Oh!
[59:49.92]Monsters.
[59:54.17]I gotta fight my way out of this one!
[60:11.76]This is a documentary.
[60:13.80]Alright, here we go.
[60:21.31]I love that sound effect, by the way.
[60:24.94]They use it all the time in this game.
[60:26.22]It's great.
[60:40.99]I still have a wooden sword.
[60:42.01]Ooh.
[60:53.53]I learned Cyclone.
[60:54.59]That move is so goaded for the first, like, hour of the game, it's unbelievable.
[61:02.56]Potion.
[61:03.00]Good.
[61:03.48]How much health do I have?
[61:04.14]I'm good.
[61:05.28]Uh, I'm coming up on the first break.
[61:10.92]I think that's a good place to do it.
[61:13.84]Power Glove.
[61:14.78]Ooh.
[61:20.66]Alright, I lose one speed, but I get... Yeah, that's definitely worth it.
[61:28.05]Fucking catchphrase.
[61:29.03]I gotta... I'm not saying that ever again.
[61:33.86]One combat in one hour.
[61:35.40]I'll just take it right now.
[61:42.30]Hey, we just started.
[61:43.22]Why don't you go make yourself something nice.
[61:46.93]Go get a little coffee or a tea or a popcorn or something.
[61:51.63]We're here.
[61:52.11]We're here for the long haul.
[61:54.13]These are my favorite games of all time.
[61:55.65]And we're going to enjoy it all freaking... Sorry, I said a little bit of a bad word there.
[62:04.13]All night.
[62:04.67]I'll be right back.
[62:12.44]Enjoy the waterfall.
[62:18.33]Ads will play in about 25 seconds.
[62:19.82]Here we go.
[66:14.24]Welcome back.
[66:16.66]Just sat down.
[66:17.36]Perfect timing.
[66:17.86]Alright, so for just... Let's get a little bit of... Let's do a quick recap.
[66:24.96]I'm kidding.
[66:25.42]We're not doing that.
[66:25.98]Don't worry.
[66:27.20]Okay.
[66:40.23]Power Glove already showing itself.
[66:44.52]Yeah, I like active battles because sometimes you can even do, if you have a ton of speed, you can do sometimes up to even two or three attacks sometimes before the other enemy does anything.
[67:01.22]And I do have Cyclone, that's right.
[67:09.41]What's with these inputs?
[67:10.21]Sometimes... Okay.
[67:12.47]The inputs are weird.
[67:13.17]I just tried to go past that gold screen like four times.
[67:23.14]You ever played Final Fantasy VII?
[67:24.46]I have played Final Fantasy VII by watching other people play it.
[67:30.34]This is the Steam version.
[67:33.19]What the fuck?
[67:34.75]Guys, what the fuck?
[67:38.09]Where...
[67:41.54]Where's my house?
[67:42.24]A Millennial Fair?
[67:54.74]Here?
[67:54.96]Have you been in your cups?
[67:57.88]Our kingdom is only 600 years old!
[68:00.20]King Guardia the 21st still reigns!
[68:02.68]Last I checked.
[68:09.65]I scarce remember the days before the war against the Fiendlord began.
[68:12.81]The months turned to years.
[68:15.25]When will it all end?
[68:33.16]I want... this.
[69:00.42]Imagine telling a soldier, hey, don't forget to shoot your gun.
[69:08.02]I mean, it's true.
[69:08.80]I'm going to sell this.
[69:09.84]I don't need it.
[69:14.61]I'll go.
[69:15.99]I'll do defense.
[69:16.55]It's a pretty massive increase.
[69:31.13]I got five potions, I'm fine.
[69:35.37]Soundtrack is really good.
[69:36.89]The soundtrack is probably the best part of this whole game.
[69:39.23]It's funny, Holly and I were talking about this an hour ago before the stream started.
[69:46.17]A lot of what you remember in old games is the music first.
[69:51.15]And then everything else is built, kind of generated from the music.
[70:00.10]A soundtrack is probably the most important part.
[70:05.44]It's up there in like the first two to three slots of any video game.
[70:09.39]If you've got an unbelievable soundtrack, you have an unforgettable game.
[70:21.23]Oh, praise be.
[70:22.05]They found Queen Lean wandering up in the canyon.
[70:25.61]She'd been missing for so long, I'd feared the worst.
[70:29.23]She must be back at the castle by now, getting some much-needed rest.
[70:34.68]There he is.
[70:41.28]You an outsider, too?
[70:42.20]My name's Toma.
[70:44.10]I'm an explorer.
[70:45.56]And if you can spare ten gold to buy this round, I'll be a storyteller, too.
[70:50.68]What do you say?
[70:53.48]Yes.
[70:55.22]Another mug.
[70:59.32]Cheers, friend.
[71:01.24]Well, then, a promise is a promise.
[71:02.66]It's about the missing queen.
[71:05.09]Lean in.
[71:05.35]Listen up.
[71:06.69]My travels have taken me to the cathedral in the Western Wood.
[71:09.53]There's something pretty peculiar about that place.
[71:12.49]It's only a hunch, but... I beg your pardon.
[71:15.66]They found Queen Lean in the canyon?
[71:18.40]Oh.
[71:19.92]It seems my suspicions were misplaced.
[71:22.86]Huh?
[71:24.14]Who is this bro?
[71:25.60]What's he do with this guy?
[71:28.30]Yeah, I was always certain something foul was afoot at the Cathedral to the West.
[71:32.84]Maybe you should go there.
[71:34.33]Fair.
[71:39.39]Have you gone mad?
[71:40.37]It is no time for mirth and mummery.
[71:47.30]Of course.
[71:47.60]Then might you show the good grace to stop wandering about pestering folk with moronic questions.
[72:21.60]This box has been handed down for generations.
[72:37.83]Should you somehow manage to open it, you are welcome to the contents.
[72:42.70]Mysterious force seals it shut.
[72:44.74]There's so many secrets in this game and I'm going to miss two thirds of them.
[72:50.62]Guaranteed.
[72:52.92]What was that?
[73:08.42]Welcome.
[73:09.68]Oh, I thought it's just going to open the thing.
[73:16.07]I got full health.
[73:17.93]We talked to Toma.
[73:41.92]I'm Banter, the village blacksmith, and forging this bell at the king's behest, as a symbol of his love of Queen Leend.
[73:49.50]The queen's vanishing act had me wondering if all this work would be for naught.
[73:53.66]After all, what's the bell without the queen, eh?
[73:56.76]It seems they found her in the canyon up north.
[73:59.22]She's back at the castle now, and I'm back to work.
[74:06.65]My husband wants a daughter, both clever and fair.
[74:11.71]OK.
[74:22.86]I don't have any money so.
[74:24.82]OK.
[74:29.88]I love the overworld in this game.
[74:32.20]So here's the cathedral.
[74:33.22]And then this is, I believe, yeah, the Zenon Bridge.
[74:39.81]It is broken.
[74:43.35]Can't go here.
[74:50.25]What version of this?
[74:56.96]This is the Steam version.
[74:59.62]And I'm sorry that you just threw up in your mouth.
[75:02.56]Okay, so we go to Guardia Forest.
[75:04.12]We could go up.
[75:05.22]I... I don't remember.
[75:07.42]I think this... I should come... I come back here with... um... later.
[75:19.81]Oh great Lord and Master, deliver your judgment upon the weak and undeserving.
[75:25.64]Yeah, don't spoil anything.
[75:26.48]I don't want to see spoilers.
[75:27.40]Permanent bans.
[75:29.64]Remember, permanent means forever.
[75:31.74]That we might reclaim the future of ourselves in your name.
[75:34.94]Oh, how delicious, I mean, delightful looking you are.
[75:41.26]We pray for the peace of our world.
[75:43.24]We are ever so devout.
[75:45.48]Ha ha ha!
[75:54.95]Why not say a prayer for yourselves?
[75:56.63]So funny.
[76:14.24]That was a Dark Souls chuckle?
[76:15.58]Alright, I think I have enough.
[76:17.68]I'm going for it.
[76:21.33]I love this song.
[76:23.48]Turn it up?
[76:24.50]I'm turnin' it up.
[76:30.40]Blastin' it.
[76:38.75]Alright, Cyclone.
[76:51.38]Does this have the bonus material?
[76:53.08]I believe it has the DS stuff in it.
[76:54.64]74 gold.
[76:54.80]That's kind of a lot.
[77:21.86]Strength capsule?
[77:22.72]What is that?
[77:23.08]I didn't pick that up when I was like fucking 12.
[77:33.24]Permanently raises your strength by one.
[77:35.07]I'm gonna save this.
[77:36.55]I don't know who to give this to.
[77:41.11]Oh, tabs.
[77:41.85]They're called tabs.
[77:46.74]oh shit so they've renamed a couple things in the remaster it was called a tab they changed a lot has changed what the heck okay uh I need a save point I'm surprised I haven't seen one yet oh wait
[78:18.27]My favorite part about this game is this is one of the first RPGs to have all the party members that you can have.
[78:25.57]I'm not going to spoil it, but they work together and you have moves that can only happen between certain party members.
[78:32.94]Sometimes it's two, sometimes it's three.
[78:36.54]It's really cool.
[78:43.16]Those are spoilers.
[78:44.08]Geez.
[78:44.46]No, they're not.
[78:46.10]It's a game mechanic.
[78:51.72]Can you please beatbox the meow mix theme?
[78:55.38]No, that encourages that behavior, uh, later.
[78:58.20]So, no, I'm sorry.
[78:59.10]As fun as that sounds.
[79:04.66]As fun as that does sound.
[79:18.70]I want chicken, I want liver.
[79:23.70]Meow mix, meow mix, please deliver.
[79:28.45]I want chicken, I want liver.
[79:36.31]What a stupid song.
[79:40.13]Why do we pretend like our animals that give a shit about any of this?
[79:44.38]Oh, it's like the cat is singing.
[79:45.60]I like chicken and liver and I like salmon.
[79:48.72]No, the cat's just going to eat it.
[79:56.22]The enemy dropped a shelter.
[79:58.40]Ooh, cool.
[80:00.90]Free stuff.
[80:04.90]Oops.
[80:11.59]That's bad.
[80:13.19]I gotta heal.
[80:22.15]I love that animation too, that dring, dring.
[80:25.79]Give me a crit.
[80:29.23]Stop going into battles?
[80:36.94]I need that EXP.
[80:37.72]I want to level up.
[80:39.72]And I want the money.
[80:56.14]And I'm going, I want to look at everything.
[80:58.27]I'm in a nostalgia trip right now.
[80:59.95]Okay, I think that's it here.
[81:09.88]Do you play the Mario RPG remake?
[81:11.44]I did.
[81:11.96]I loved it.
[81:13.56]I loved it.
[81:14.10]I loved it.
[81:14.54]I loved it.
[81:14.96]I loved it.
[81:15.36]There's one thing I didn't really love.
[81:19.38]And it's the moves.
[81:20.92]Those super combo moves that they added.
[81:23.82]Made the game way too easy.
[81:26.57]But I loved it.
[81:28.63]I loved it.
[81:29.13]Now here we go.
[81:44.30]Hey, there we go.
[81:52.50]Certified hater?
[81:53.27]No.
[81:56.69]Uh, best music in the game, potentially.
[81:59.81]Not yet, but you'll hear it soon.
[82:03.73]Oh, who goes there?
[82:04.47]I've not seen your face before, and those outlandish clothes wouldn't be one of the Fiendlord's agents, would we?
[82:13.72]Fat chance.
[82:14.26]Look at him.
[82:14.98]That boy's not built to lift a sword, let alone serve in the Fiend Lord's army.
[82:19.32]I suppose you're right.
[82:20.42]Now run along, boy, before we're forced to lock you up in the tower.
[82:24.52]Stop that at once!
[82:26.61]Queen Leen!
[82:31.87]That man is my friend, and you will treat him as such.
[82:36.65]But, Your Majesty, there's something strange about him.
[82:44.59]Yeah, sorry, they didn't translate this like nowadays.
[82:48.41]Do you think they're gonna have to do that in like 20 years?
[83:16.06]I envy you to be favored by the Queen.
[83:23.73]What else is there?
[83:24.29]I can do some other stuff here, can't I?
[83:27.77]I'm afraid he has no aura, my liege!
[83:32.45]The dining hall is below.
[83:35.89]The master of kitchens has a foul temper.
[83:37.61]I stay out of his way unless you fancy a tongue lashing.
[83:41.65]What?
[83:48.12]This dining hall is for the members of the knighthood, but you're welcome at our tables.
[83:51.64]Eat your fill before you go.
[83:55.45]I'm dying.
[83:56.39]I'm dying of hunger.
[84:02.41]Your meal is ready.
[84:03.09]Ooh, delicious finally.
[84:06.89]Ham, cheese, potatoes, onions.
[84:11.99]The master of kitchens has earned his post.
[84:13.65]His cooking is worthy of at least three stars.
[84:18.69]The theme lord's troops had better watch out for us.
[84:23.57]Oh yeah, this guy down here.
[84:27.52]So you and Her Majesty the Queen are acquainted?
[84:29.40]The kitchen is a battlefield in its own right.
[84:35.22]True.
[84:40.19]Have you come to season my broth with your lack of culinary expertise?
[84:43.83]How do you have no place in my kitchen?
[84:48.19]Oh, what in the name of all that is good is this ice cream that Her Majesty so wishes to prepare?
[85:04.58]Ice cream.
[85:09.19]That was Adam Sandler?
[85:21.84]Oh, Commander, beg pardons, it's not quite ready.
[85:25.46]Yeah, had to be ready soon.
[85:28.92]My men and I risk our lives in this war.
[85:31.20]Is it so much to ask that you keep us fed?
[85:33.42]Quickly now!
[85:37.11]Enough of your self-righteous ranting.
[85:39.13]You knights aren't the only ones putting your lives on the line for this kingdom.
[85:44.46]Oh, I think I've lost my appetite.
[85:47.18]And I'll stumble from meat-braised and coward to see that my men are fed.
[85:57.65]Go find someone else to command.
[85:59.25]I don't need you telling me how to do my job.
[86:07.99]Our new commander is working hard to fill Sir Cyrus's shoes.
[86:12.48]It's tough.
[86:15.34]A commander's a good man.
[86:17.02]Master of kitchens, but rubs him the wrong way.
[86:24.58]I... Alright, I didn't... Whatever.
[86:28.91]I'm just reading it.
[86:29.79]I'm not doing... I was just joking.
[86:35.51]Mild men are Dark Souls character voices.
[86:42.65]The knight's quarters are below.
[86:48.51]The music is so loud.
[86:49.77]Yeah, well, I told you I was turning it up.
[86:52.33]That's what I do.
[86:53.87]Ooh.
[86:55.07]Now I have to retire that forever.
[87:01.27]Xenin Bridge is our last line of defense.
[87:03.81]It must hold, even should it mean our lives.
[87:06.11]You're the queen's friend, are you not?
[87:09.79]Talk to the maid if you need rest.
[87:14.49]Would you like to rest?
[87:15.43]Yes.
[87:26.53]I think I'm good.
[87:29.13]Alright.
[87:31.01]Kinggardia the 24th sits in audience within.
[87:50.26]I am to understand that you played some role in helping to rescue my lady wife.
[87:54.89]I owe you a debt of gratitude.
[87:57.69]But you know what befell Lean?
[88:00.49]She's been acting rather oddly since her return.
[88:03.97]And she seems to have lost the coral hairpin that she always wore.
[88:07.37]She always treasured that thing so.
[88:10.11]Forgive me.
[88:11.01]You must be tired.
[88:11.97]Please rest in the Knight's quarters down the stairs to the left.
[88:14.83]I'll speak to the Commander.
[88:29.69]Alright, this is actually kind of a loud alternative.
[88:35.54]It's a long chair.
[88:36.40]Yeah, it is.
[88:36.72]Queen's chambers are above.
[88:37.76]She has granted you permission to pass.
[89:08.83]Isn't there an item up here?
[89:17.12]100 gold?
[89:17.48]Did I just steal that?
[89:19.88]Is that bad?
[89:24.52]Mysterious force seals it shut.
[89:34.05]Hmm.
[89:36.55]What do you want?
[89:37.09]Get gone from here.
[89:45.47]Just between you and I, the Chancellor has been acting strangely these days.
[89:49.19]I've spied him sneaking out of the castle time and time again.
[89:55.54]The only thing that I've noticed out of the ordinary as of late is that the sluggish creature has not been around.
[90:00.56]They say a curse turned him into a frog, but I question the truth of that.
[90:05.12]No doubt he's been one of the Fiend Lord spies all along.
[90:13.59]People think the Chancellor's behavior is strange, but I don't find it troubling at all.
[90:17.71]The Chancellor is a man of strong faith.
[90:19.23]That's why he goes to Monolia Cathedral every day to pray.
[90:22.91]More free shit.
[90:27.30]Oooh, fuck!
[90:29.04]Stop doing that!
[90:29.80]That's way better.
[90:43.74]Alright, I'm good.
[90:44.40]Let's progress the story.
[90:46.34]2025 is definitely the year of the ooh.
[90:58.29]Yeah, but did I do this before?
[90:59.95]Is this a new thing since I came back to streaming more regularly?
[91:03.63]Is that what I do now?
[91:04.83]That's just, oh yeah, that's just what I do.
[91:07.42]Do I even need to say that?
[91:13.55]I know there's a fucking mouse on the screen.
[91:15.11]I got it.
[91:15.51]The Majesty awaits.
[91:37.45]It's been over 10 years since Her Majesty first came to this castle, but she's scarce aged a day.
[91:43.13]In fact, she looks even younger now than she did before her disappearance.
[91:49.82]An ether.
[91:50.74]I think that's mana.
[91:51.22]You're the one who saved our queen?
[91:56.70]I'd expected one a bit more dashing.
[92:02.10]Oh, there you are.
[92:04.91]Please leave us.
[92:05.89]I need to have words with this man in private.
[92:09.93]As you wish, your majesty.
[92:18.34]Come near, don't be shy.
[92:19.42]Hehe.
[92:25.80]Fooled you, didn't I, Crono?
[92:30.90]It's me.
[92:32.38]But everyone keeps calling me lean for some reason.
[92:40.03]I'm glad you came.
[92:42.93]We were only together for that short time at the fair, but somehow I knew you'd come for me.
[92:55.19]Thank you, Chrono.
[92:59.23]What's happening?
[93:06.44]I feel like I'm being torn apart!
[93:09.76]Help me!
[93:10.30]Chrono!
[93:10.88]I can't!
[93:12.36]Ah!
[93:12.74]Oh my god, this is not, like, funny.
[93:13.72]This is scary.
[93:14.56]I'm dying.
[93:15.61]Help me.
[93:16.07]I've ruined it.
[93:16.51]Uh-oh.
[93:28.78]Now, I didn't do anything, though.
[93:31.60]I didn't do anything.
[93:32.58]How do... What do I do now?
[93:35.18]Uh-oh.
[93:39.72]Oh no.
[93:42.26]That was like the worst rendition of that scene.
[93:49.23]That couldn't have gone any worse, I don't think.
[93:50.85]I really don't think it could have gone any worse.
[93:54.55]Her Majesty's dismissed you already?
[93:57.99]You didn't engage in any untoward behavior, did you?
[94:02.54]What?
[94:03.20]Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[94:06.10]Of course not.
[94:08.28]I just hope that's the case.
[94:12.66]A great number of things change as the years go by.
[94:16.24]But if there is one thing that we will ever be the same, it's women and their insufferable love of gossip.
[94:30.19]I'm not going to tell them.
[94:31.05]Yeah, why wouldn't I say something?
[94:32.33]Because I think they're going to be mad at me.
[94:39.03]That guy's just had it.
[94:40.95]That guy's just had it.
[94:42.97]Oh no!
[94:47.02]You're okay.
[94:47.94]Did you find the girl?
[94:50.92]She what?
[94:52.24]She disappeared.
[94:56.24]Just as I thought then.
[94:57.02]I knew I recognized her from somewhere.
[95:06.52]We seem to be in Guardia, but it looks like a lot older than the Guardia we're from.
[95:12.64]They must have mistaken that girl for her ancestor.
[95:16.35]After all, that girl was our Princess Nadia.
[95:19.85]What the fuu- Marl, that is, Princess Nadia, is a descendant of Queen Lean.
[95:42.45]Queen Leen was kidnapped, and someone was supposed to have gone and saved her.
[95:46.51]But now history's been changed.
[95:55.22]Mara looks so much like the queen that they probably called off their search when she appeared.
[95:59.94]But if the real queen is killed... That's it.
[96:05.44]For all of them.
[96:11.75]Marle will never have existed.
[96:13.63]But there might still be enough time.
[96:15.37]If we can save the Queen, history as we know it should remain unchanged.
[96:21.51]We gotta stop it, Marty.
[96:24.49]Something must happen to the Queen in this era if she isn't rescued.
[96:28.51]And if something happens to her, her descendant Princess Nadia will never come into being.
[96:33.50]We have to find the real Queen.
[96:34.64]And Luca has joined your party.
[96:43.27]Queen's chambers are above.
[96:44.33]She granted permission to... Oh, I said that already.
[96:46.45]Sorry.
[96:52.85]Okay, now we gotta find her.
[96:56.26]So... If you remember... What, uh... What Toma said...
[97:11.65]Do you know about how long this gameplay is?
[97:14.99]Um, it's not crazy long, but it's at least, it's at least like 15 to 30 hours.
[97:21.56]It's probably like, yeah, it's probably like 20 hours.
[97:24.92]On a playthrough like this where I'm just really casually going through and just talking and stuff, probably like 30.
[97:31.76]Optional stuff, yeah.
[97:35.89]Um, I'm going to give Luca some stuff.
[97:41.32]Luka has one of the best weapons.
[97:42.38]The gun is so good.
[97:48.52]Reveals HP of enemies or more speed.
[97:51.00]I'll keep that on for now.
[97:58.63]Now we got two members of our party.
[98:07.58]Luka doesn't have any tech.
[98:09.68]Not yet, at least.
[98:15.04]I hated Luca as a kid.
[98:16.39]I don't know why I disliked her so much.
[98:17.67]Why?
[98:17.89]I wonder why.
[98:18.29]I always thought she was cool.
[98:22.03]She was kind of like the engineer, like brilliant scientist.
[98:26.07]I like the gun too.
[98:28.96]I thought the gun made a cool sound when I was younger.
[98:30.76]120 G.
[98:43.62]And then probably Mr. Satan.
[98:44.78]I don't even know that guy.
[98:48.10]I just know that one line.
[99:10.46]Ooh, flamethrower.
[99:11.18]Okay.
[99:12.46]So Luca just learned flamethrower, and now we have dual-tech flame whirl.
[99:16.47]Be paying attention.
[99:18.05]Let's do fire whirl.
[99:28.03]I want to see it.
[99:28.75]Come on, hit them all.
[99:38.00]I can't get them all.
[99:42.38]Nice.
[99:42.62]This is gonna be a lot of damage.
[99:45.69]Oof!
[99:58.51]I do need to buy some stuff.
[100:02.71]Chrono's taking a lot of damage.
[100:06.46]I got eight.
[100:06.96]Let me get to like a thousand gold.
[100:10.94]You played Chrono Trigger before?
[100:13.35]Yes.
[100:15.89]Never on stream, but I have played it.
[100:18.05]Many, many times.
[100:24.51]But again, the hard drive has been completely rewritten.
[100:27.47]Every five to ten years when I play this game, it's like playing it all over again for the first time.
[100:41.05]The one thing that I remember, which was really weird and really specific, and I'm going to need help with it.
[100:45.95]Some of those optional crazy items, and there's no spoiler on this, but you know the one I'm talking about, the shell.
[100:54.70]That is, isn't that really specific to find that and get it?
[100:57.86]So I'm probably going to need some help.
[101:04.76]Yes, that shell.
[101:10.21]Jeremy, this is my first stream.
[101:13.01]Ever?
[101:15.25]We got a first timer in here.
[101:16.77]And you know what we do for every new first timer?
[101:18.67]We sing their name and we throw them a little party.
[101:22.58]So... Uh, let me get the music going.
[101:26.60]First timer!
[101:28.34]What the fuck?
[101:31.66]Okay.
[101:32.08]Hey, Radical!
[101:37.60]Welcome to the stream.
[101:38.60]Welcome to the stream.
[101:39.44]We like to have fun.
[101:40.40]We welcome to the stream and welcome to the stream and happy birthday when it's your birthday.
[101:44.20]Happy birthday when it's your birthday in a few years.
[101:47.94]Welcome.
[102:02.47]Oh, that one hurt.
[102:04.33]That like hurt my, that my bones hurt after that.
[102:15.51]I meant to say every year, but I said a few years.
[102:17.69]Not even here anymore.
[102:25.71]Being nice hurts your bones?
[102:27.63]No, singing a fucking terrible song that makes me look like an idiot.
[102:33.33]I want 800.
[102:39.02]That's too much.
[102:45.73]It was good.
[102:46.17]It wasn't terrible.
[102:47.65]It was good.
[102:48.05]You don't need the song for that.
[102:52.29]That's true.
[103:00.34]I think defense is more important.
[103:06.94]This is my last stream ever.
[103:08.54]Oh man.
[103:24.81]I think we're good.
[103:28.89]Sell this junk.
[103:36.88]Five potions.
[103:37.66]How many, uh, ether is... This thing is crazy expensive.
[103:41.84]Okay.
[103:52.34]I'm gonna get a couple more.
[103:53.24]You can never have too many of those, honestly.
[104:01.83]And one of these, too.
[104:03.61]They're expensive, but I want it.
[104:06.41]Gotta be prepared.
[104:07.05]Best game ever made?
[104:11.40]That's right.
[104:12.82]That's actually correct.
[104:22.70]Can we get a let's freaking go?
[104:23.94]I'm only allowed to do one cringe thing a month.
[104:29.94]I think this stream has already done four, so... I think I've got everything situated for the next few months.
[104:42.43]You're probably done for life?
[104:43.89]No, not for life.
[104:52.17]Let's say a prayer.
[104:54.77]What did you find?
[104:57.67]A hairpin?
[104:58.27]Hey, this is Guardia's royal crest.
[105:02.75]Cyclone.
[105:25.34]I'm gonna need to... yeah.
[105:29.58]Oh shit.
[105:31.48]That was annoying.
[105:33.82]I can't use the analog.
[105:34.66]That's dead, right?
[105:47.91]Ah, let's do Flame Whirl.
[105:50.03]Good.
[105:50.45]When they bunch up like that, it's awesome because you get three in a row.
[105:59.87]I didn't get it.
[106:00.69]I thought the indicator was on the other one too.
[106:02.23]Holy shit, that was a lot.
[106:12.26]Sounds like you're in a chair under a lot of blankets.
[106:14.18]Well, one of those things is true.
[106:15.20]There we go.
[106:32.35]320.
[106:32.37]Chrono leveled up.
[106:36.73]I wasn't expecting that.
[106:39.19]Uh-oh.
[106:41.43]There.
[106:45.86]Yes!
[106:47.90]Uh... Lower your guard and you allow the enemy in.
[106:55.76]You've come to save the queen.
[106:58.16]The fiend's lair lies within, it would seem.
[107:00.92]Will you accompany me?
[107:04.79]You know, I can't stand frogs.
[107:06.61]Wait, wait!
[107:06.81]You don't seem like a bad frog.
[107:08.05]I mean, person.
[107:09.29]I mean... What should we do, Chrono?
[107:35.57]Go with the frog.
[107:38.65]Alright, I guess I'll just have to get over my aversions to slimy, moist-skinned creatures.
[107:46.69]What's your name?
[107:49.27]Frog.
[107:50.28]We don't change that.
[108:01.60]This song in Chrono Cross is awesome, too.
[108:08.40]Frog will suffice.
[108:09.18]Look at the big muscly arm, I love that.
[108:15.39]Alright, nice to meet you, Frog.
[108:18.83]And you as well.
[108:19.63]This room must conceal a hidden passage.
[108:22.29]Let us search every corner.
[108:25.99]I'm gonna drop the accent in probably like 30 minutes, by the way.
[108:28.89]Around like 10 o'clock tonight, I'm gonna be reading it like a book.
[108:33.67]So...
[108:39.24]Is Chrono Cross actually good?
[108:40.62]Uh... Let's just say... It's very good.
[108:57.29]But it's kind of a mess.
[109:00.15]It is a wonderful game, but it's kind of a mess.
[109:10.98]it's yeah it's definitely a mess but it's a very very cool beautiful wonderful mess alright now we gotta actually we gotta play now good song alert I don't know if I would play chrono cross on stream
[109:41.42]That game is kind of, it's very long, it's a little, it's very long-winded.
[109:46.24]Big crit.
[110:03.53]Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[110:14.31]Um, let me heal.
[110:15.67]Alright, should I start giving the strength tablet?
[110:20.51]What do I want them to do?
[110:21.29]Because this ma- oh, sorry.
[110:24.01]There's magic tabs, there's strength tabs, there's speed tabs, right?
[110:27.22]You kind of need to pick somebody to permanently give this to.
[110:39.93]Use everything on yourself.
[110:44.10]Yeah.
[110:46.32]I mean that's... any of the characters can be swapped out.
[110:49.71]Well, let's not say that yet.
[110:55.93]What's with the disguises?
[110:58.80]Hurry up and change.
[111:00.28]No need to be walking around like humans in here.
[111:06.64]It's almost time for my shift.
[111:08.64]I hate pretending to be human.
[111:10.54]It's so smelly and repulsive.
[111:12.70]It's demeaning.
[111:18.90]Those ones we ate last time weren't so bad.
[111:21.02]And those two soldiers we just caught look plump and juicy.
[111:29.67]Sakura's a genius.
[111:31.05]His plan to imprison the Chancellor and take on his role worked like magic.
[111:35.95]Now the queen's ours and the castle's in an uproar.
[111:38.41]This is rich.
[111:39.89]Alright, I think I'll pay my respects to the fiend lord statue before my shift starts.
[111:48.76]That was you that said that.
[111:49.88]That's how you probably thought before you walked out.
[112:09.50]Did you by chance come to save Queen Leen?
[112:11.68]Oh, you did!
[112:12.30]That's good to know!
[112:13.12]Oh, you came to rescue me?
[112:26.35]How kind of you, but I assure you there's no need.
[112:29.75]The master of this place, Yakra, is so very kind.
[112:32.94]I've decided to stay here.
[112:34.30]Please make yourselves at home, too.
[112:39.38]Oh, how good of you to come.
[112:40.82]I'm sure Yakura will be pleased.
[112:42.96]Please, pass the time in here with us until he has a chance to come and greet you properly.
[112:54.38]F?
[112:56.89]Oh, great Magus.
[112:58.09]Magus the Great.
[112:59.59]Your eyes are brighter than the stars.
[113:01.23]You're flowing here like waves atop the sea.
[113:04.90]Ooh Okay, that's two good items
[113:35.68]Well, great Magus.
[113:36.50]Magus the Great.
[113:37.38]Your eyes are brighter than the stars.
[113:39.04]You're flowing here like waves atop the sea.
[113:41.32]And they're not fighting me in here.
[113:51.31]Come join us in singing your funeral judge.
[113:55.85]Oh, shit.
[113:59.07]I gotta get all the people in the front here.
[114:02.38]Come on, Luca.
[114:03.04]Speed it up.
[114:13.21]Oh, you love to see it.
[114:18.45]I love when Frog does a crit.
[114:19.77]Does the backflip.
[114:22.44]Do you get anything for doing this?
[114:41.64]How does it feel knowing that they're gonna sing Imagine Dragons at your funeral?
[114:44.63]I mean, that would be... That'd be... I mean, that'd be kind of funny.
[114:55.94]They're only gonna do that if I say to do that as a joke.
[115:03.28]But I'm not gonna put that in my funeral will.
[115:13.83]I can't think of something I would rather not do than that.
[115:21.72]Speed Belt.
[115:24.46]I think Luka needs this.
[115:31.99]I'll keep the Power Glove on Chrono.
[115:37.77]Give Luka the Speed Belt.
[115:40.29]Give Frog the Guardian Bangle.
[115:45.58]Yeah, I'm okay with that.
[115:53.07]I love the Power Glove.
[115:53.95]Yeah, it's good.
[115:59.95]Would you want to play Monster Mash at your funeral?
[116:05.40]Um, let's not talk about what I would play at my funeral.
[116:08.74]That's not for a while, guys.
[116:16.12]How we doing on health?
[116:22.53]We're doing fine.
[116:30.00]Don't be in such a hurry to leave.
[116:31.40]Please take the time to enjoy yourselves with us.
[116:37.95]I love that sound.
[116:43.93]Grit.
[116:53.04]The boss fights in this game are so fun too.
[117:02.72]That's a pretty good dipping sauce recommendation.
[117:05.52]Uh, sweet and sour, mild buffalo, hot honey, honey in general.
[117:10.37]Something like that.
[117:17.54]Depends on the food.
[117:20.54]I'd say that was, that'd be chicken for me.
[117:33.92]What would you play at your birth?
[117:36.26]I don't know.
[117:41.38]I don't know.
[117:42.32]Whatever that is.
[117:44.92]Ave Maria.
[118:08.27]Now, that would be at my funeral, but it would be me singing it on a video screen.
[118:13.93]And now, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming to the funeral.
[118:16.95]We have a special presentation from the man himself.
[118:20.72]And it's me.
[118:21.38]It's a video of me saying, hey, everybody, thank you for coming.
[118:24.96]I want to have a rendition of this song.
[118:27.56]Please sing along if you know the lyrics.
[118:30.73]And I just start going... Ave Maria
[118:39.47]I don't know the rest of the words.
[118:48.78]XP.
[118:57.18]Do you know what is Peter Griffin?
[119:04.82]No.
[119:06.08]I don't want people to get up and leave my own funeral.
[119:09.36]It's not a stream.
[119:11.54]If I say something stupid, you guys can just turn this off and come back tomorrow.
[119:14.50]But like, I don't want people to get up and leave to be like, wow, this sucks.
[119:17.58]Let's get out of here.
[119:26.20]That'd be really fucked up, but whatever.
[119:29.98]Ooh, Slurp Slash.
[119:32.96]Ooh, fuck you!
[119:34.46]I hate that I do this now!
[119:36.98]I'm genuinely upset about this.
[119:38.50]I'm not kidding.
[119:39.18]Free shit.
[119:52.69]Maiden suit?
[120:04.48]That's good.
[120:10.51]She's got, does she have higher defense than Frog?
[120:12.67]Not quite.
[120:16.41]You definitely did it before, you're just aware of it now.
[120:20.67]Really?
[120:23.74]Ooh, what is that?
[120:25.06]Hey, there's humans in here!
[120:30.76]Try and steal our bromide, will you?
[120:36.46]This is bromide.
[120:39.85]That is highly corrosive, reactive, and toxic.
[120:44.17]What?
[120:44.85]That may as well have been nuclear waste.
[121:05.59]It's only for, like, ten of you.
[121:07.69]Nobody fucking- is it gonna be that- like, maybe five of you are gonna know what that is.
[121:12.89]That's my favorite part about streaming, by the way, is- is when, like, six of you know what that is.
[121:21.73]Yes, that's Niall Redd, but it's not a Niall Redd video.
[121:30.30]It's the nuclear engineer guy.
[121:31.92]Yes, it is.
[121:32.64]One of my favorite videos.
[121:43.72]I actually love that guy's videos.
[121:48.34]He just kind of like tears apart everything.
[121:50.05]He's just like, nah, that would never work.
[121:51.97]No.
[121:53.37]It's like, so what would happen if there was a nuclear?
[121:55.43]Nah, that just wouldn't happen.
[121:56.33]There would never be an explosion like that ever.
[121:58.41]Stupid.
[122:03.71]I'm going to get up and take a break.
[122:08.87]That's not how I would have done it.
[122:11.65]I love that channel, it's just funny.
[122:19.49]No, I like Niall Redd's videos too.
[122:23.08]This is like a reaction to one of Niall Redd's videos.
[122:40.89]Alright, I'll be right back.
[122:41.63]I'll see you in a minute.
[122:47.02]Is it this video?
[122:47.94]It's probably that one, yeah.
[122:52.04]Great content.
[122:52.72]I actually love those channels.
[122:55.83]We'll talk about it when I get back.
[122:56.75]Ads are going to start here.
[124:08.60]Thank you.
[127:12.55]Hello.
[127:15.47]Welcome back.
[127:18.57]Yeah, uh, Niall Redd's videos.
[127:21.45]I love watching them.
[127:23.92]It's great.
[127:24.26]It has such great wind down content.
[127:26.56]It's just like I'll be lying around, just laying down, just end of the day.
[127:30.82]Just teach me about chemicals.
[127:32.48]I just want to know.
[127:33.70]Just teach me about reactive fucking proteins and sulfuric acid and...
[127:46.27]I just love the- I love experiments.
[127:51.33]Are you gonna have your heirs battle or solve puzzles?
[128:00.24]Wait, what?
[128:02.44]We already talked about that, didn't we?
[128:05.56]Are you gonna have your heirs battle or solve puzzles to get your inheritance at your funeral?
[128:09.03]Um...
[128:14.03]Yeah, depending on how many children, uh, that I have.
[128:18.45]Which could be up to a dozen, by the way.
[128:21.31]Uh, I'm gonna make sure that they- all 12 of them are gonna get a piece of a key.
[128:26.04]They all have to have the key.
[128:28.48]The- all 12 pieces will- will solve the full riddle.
[128:32.16]And it's the only way anybody's getting shit.
[128:36.23]However many kids I have, let's say it's one, let's say it's, well, it's one, then I'm gonna break it up and just make them do a scavenger hunt.
[128:42.25]If it's two, three, four, the four of you little shits are gonna get a piece of a key, and on your 25th birthday, you little fucking rotten little bastards, on your 25th birthday,
[128:57.45]It splits up, and then you solve the puzzle, and then it unlocks 25% flat across for all four of you.
[129:04.57]But you have to come together, you have to work together, and you have to fucking be good to each other.
[129:08.15]Let's go.
[129:15.39]Oh, and by the way, if it's proven that you were not good to each other, it gets incinerated.
[129:33.12]25% of one dollar.
[129:39.17]Okay, let's go.
[129:44.87]Why do you just want to watch the world burn?
[129:46.41]I think I can press a button here, can't I?
[129:52.96]Dude, that was a tricky puzzle.
[129:59.14]Somewhere within this complex, there's a shrine to the Fiend Lord.
[130:01.88]Heard this treasure to be found there as well.
[130:04.40]I found it.
[130:07.30]You're humans?
[130:09.39]They've hidden the queen in the back.
[130:10.69]Please rescue her.
[130:11.67]Oh, these are actually humans.
[130:12.79]Hey, this is not the first time we're in the chat.
[130:16.59]Let's sing.
[130:19.39]No, that's a 30-day cooldown on that.
[130:24.33]Another capsule.
[130:25.03]Cool.
[130:39.49]Oh, whoa!
[130:41.95]Changed it up a little there.
[130:43.50]I think I got everything.
[130:52.44]Might as well get the experience.
[131:05.91]51 damage now.
[131:06.89]Nice.
[131:07.21]That's a lot.
[131:10.23]I forgot if they're in... They have a ranged weapon, but if they're in melee range, they will not shoot.
[131:23.50]Perfect.
[131:27.06]Let's heal up a little.
[131:31.18]And nine potions left.
[131:32.10]I think that's fine.
[131:36.82]Five?
[131:37.84]I'm actually kind of running out.
[131:40.96]Let's not fight these.
[131:43.44]There we go.
[131:48.98]If you had a teeny clone of yourself, would you feel bad about Torch?
[131:58.69]If you're going to go for that, you're going to go for a new one.
[132:28.52]I feel like I've been asked that question like once a month for the last like three years.
[132:33.05]I want that chest.
[132:56.82]Hold on, I want to go...
[133:03.56]I love how you can avoid shit.
[133:04.88]It's so wonderful.
[133:17.74]Should I fight this to get the experience?
[133:21.90]What do you think?
[133:24.45]Yeah, I'll kill them all in one hit.
[133:30.15]Perfect.
[133:32.67]Dammit, thought I was gonna get... sorry.
[133:41.56]Miss?
[133:44.40]Oh.
[133:45.48]What is going on here?
[133:47.44]That's good money.
[134:05.14]Alright.
[134:06.90]Let me use... Let me use one of the shelters because shelter does both mana and... Yeah, okay.
[134:24.37]Kind of need the mana.
[134:25.21]I think a boss is coming up here too.
[134:39.10]Old Jerma would never have dodged the question of what they would play at his funeral.
[134:42.89]I just told you.
[134:43.39]I just told you Ave Maria and it's me singing it and everyone leaves.
[134:53.19]I answered that in extreme detail.
[135:06.30]I don't need to do that.
[135:11.55]Actually, these guys kind of hurt.
[135:24.74]Will we be invited?
[135:25.80]Uh, invited to the funeral?
[135:29.59]I mean, when I get put up in like a glass case, you can come to that.
[135:38.33]But no, you're not coming to the funeral.
[136:02.10]Is that better than the one I just got?
[136:06.78]Uh-huh.
[136:09.50]Two more damage.
[136:15.02]Yeah, you can come to that.
[136:15.88]That's going to be for like three hours on some random Saturday or something.
[136:20.61]And that's it.
[136:20.99]I think that opened up here, right?
[136:45.44]Yep, there it is.
[136:46.86]If you're that determined to get through, by all means.
[136:50.08]That's kind of funny.
[136:57.66]Oh my god.
[136:59.56]Really?
[137:00.34]Can't get off freedom here?
[137:10.46]Is this post cinder block?
[137:11.89]Yes.
[137:13.15]Yes.
[137:16.02]Okay, it's just going to be an arms... Okay, what if it's just a suit of mine?
[137:27.53]A headless man.
[137:28.67]Yeah, it's going to be a headless man in a suit.
[137:30.29]It's going to look like a mannequin from Walmart.
[137:41.89]Okay.
[137:46.16]Will you be in a Spider-Man costume?
[137:48.90]No.
[137:49.90]No, no, I don't want to fight everybody.
[137:51.14]I want to get through.
[137:52.24]I think I have to do it.
[138:00.73]Actually, no, let's do Slurp.
[138:02.49]This is a heal, right?
[138:20.91]Not even a Dillard's mannequin?
[138:24.09]No.
[138:25.61]No, it wouldn't be.
[138:32.77]Can you project your face up into the sky?
[138:46.64]Okay, so we project up like a bat signal type thing.
[138:51.02]And then the thing that I'm in like kind of starts to move up like going vertical.
[138:58.95]So this like glass chamber that my body is in with like the head gone.
[139:03.27]And then like a cape just like falls down below but like up from my back.
[139:09.01]And it's like, holy shit, what?
[139:11.08]And it starts playing like...
[139:18.08]and then the case opens and I'm on wires and I just like fly out like my body kind of like flies out through the aisle like down the aisle with the cape out the front door.
[139:41.81]Is everybody crying?
[139:46.74]This would be, like, a really sad moment.
[139:49.78]But it's my last adventure.
[139:51.92]One last, like, adventure to go do something.
[139:59.42]Okay.
[140:11.03]I need to heal.
[140:25.93]I got plenty of MP.
[140:26.59]Yeah, I'm good.
[140:27.35]I'm good.
[140:27.79]I'm ready.
[140:37.01]Who's your favorite Star Wars character?
[140:38.35]I'm sorry if somebody's already asked this.
[140:39.97]Don't yell at me.
[140:40.89]You said you were also going to fake your own flatline in front of your family.
[140:49.16]Alright.
[140:50.62]We got a game going on here.
[140:51.72]Let's pay attention to it for a minute.
[140:54.08]What are the items?
[140:54.96]How did you get in here?
[140:56.36]Frog!
[141:26.95]Oh, he's doing the yawning, yawning, yawning, yawning, yawning, yawning.
[141:29.33]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[141:55.59]The Chancellor transformed into Yakra.
[142:03.82]That's gonna hurt.
[142:16.49]Come on, somebody get up there.
[142:20.63]Uh, Fire Whirl.
[142:22.85]And Slurp to Chrono.
[142:34.54]He looks like a skin tag?
[142:36.88]Oh!
[142:40.60]That might kill.
[142:42.81]Oof!
[142:43.77]Okay.
[142:49.75]I gotta kill him quick.
[142:56.22]Potion on Frog.
[142:57.50]And then Slurp on Luca.
[143:01.38]And then attack.
[143:04.68]We're good.
[143:06.90]He's shooting pimples?
[143:19.09]Again?
[143:19.49]Okay.
[143:43.20]Big crit.
[143:44.44]Massive crit.
[143:45.32]Wow.
[143:45.82]I need to slurp.
[143:52.09]No, don't do that two times in a row.
[143:53.65]What the fuck?
[144:19.78]Ah, Chrono is out of MP.
[144:24.98]Shit.
[144:27.14]Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.
[144:37.15]Uhhh... Should I use the Aether?
[144:39.79]I'm using it.
[144:41.01]On... Oh fuck, he's dead.
[144:43.55]Give it a frog.
[144:58.38]Yes!
[145:05.30]Yeah, with active battles, I prefer the active battles because it makes you have to fucking go for it.
[145:14.12]It's harder, but there's a scenario where you can actually do more moves and it really keeps up the pace.
[145:21.22]I like it.
[145:28.14]Thank you, frog!
[145:28.98]I knew you'd come to rescue me!
[145:35.59]His majesty awaits most anxiously.
[145:37.71]We should return to the castle.
[145:39.97]Also, the active battles, one of the things in JRPGs that I don't, um, I usually kind of sit there for too long and go, hmm, um, what should I do?
[145:48.46]Do I heal you?
[145:50.00]And then, I like it active.
[145:52.50]Like, this shit is, you gotta go.
[145:57.54]That's true.
[145:58.80]It's kind of like chess.
[146:04.78]I feel like I make better decisions with active.
[146:12.19]I sit there and overthink for too long.
[146:18.15]I thank you, Crono and Luca, for all your aid.
[146:23.51]And I as well.
[146:24.11]Please accompany us to the castle.
[146:25.41]You will be most welcome guests.
[146:33.27]Active feels a little more dramatic.
[146:36.23]Yeah, I see both ways there.
[146:38.59]I mean, sometimes you really just want to, like, hang out and you don't really want the pressure of having to make decisions quickly, but I think it makes for, at least on stream, too, it might be, like, kind of a little more hectic, so it might be fun.
[146:52.04]Oh, my thanks.
[146:52.94]That monster stuffed me in there like a sack of coin.
[146:55.38]Oh, your majesty.
[147:00.12]I am undamaged, as you can see.
[147:06.68]a mid Ether.
[147:07.38]I kind of like both turn-based and ATB depending on my mood.
[147:14.33]Yeah, the only thing is I gotta stick with it because I don't think you can change it.
[147:23.31]I think it's per playthrough.
[147:27.82]That is to be on our way.
[147:33.49]You can in the settings?
[147:35.45]Oh, that's good to know.
[147:36.43]So if I kind of just want to relax, I can just, uh, I can turn it off.
[147:39.25]It's cool for now, though.
[147:43.36]You cannot know how worried, how I was so worried, Lynn.
[147:49.34]Yakra, that vile beast, impersonating me and kidnapping the queen.
[147:54.28]We must institute a stricter criminal justice system in this kingdom to ensure such fiends never threaten the royal family's safety ever again.
[148:16.40]Frog!
[148:16.60]Hmm...
[148:51.89]Okay, this and Kiss from a Rose are like the two best songs I ever made.
[148:59.94]Okay.
[149:01.82]You have my deepest gratitude, Lord Crono, but I wonder who then was that girl we found in the canyon?
[149:11.45]I am forever in your debt.
[149:13.01]Who knows what would have to happen to me if you had not come a little later?
[149:15.89]If you came later, what would have happened?
[149:18.59]By the way, what became of the girl who was mistaken for me?
[149:22.33]I forgot all about Princess Nadia!
[149:24.83]Corona, where did the princess disappear?
[149:26.31]She may be there now.
[149:34.65]She's back.
[149:35.84]She's back.
[149:46.60]I didn't know a frog could be so brave.
[149:53.43]Oh, wrong side.
[149:53.85]What other RPGs do you like?
[149:54.55]I like Mario RPG.
[149:55.19]This.
[150:21.35]I would lie to you and say Secret of Mana, but I rented that once at Blockbuster and loved the music, loved everything about it, and never played it ever again, but I'm gonna just pretend like I like it.
[150:32.54]Um...
[150:43.37]I really actually did like the new Final Fantasy.
[150:47.21]I thought it was really cinematic, really fun.
[150:49.69]The music was great.
[150:50.97]It was great.
[150:52.23]I never finished it though.
[150:52.97]16, yeah.
[151:01.68]What happened?
[151:06.36]Princess Nadia.
[151:08.52]Crono.
[151:11.21]It was awful.
[151:11.87]I was so afraid.
[151:12.81]I couldn't see or feel anything, but I knew I was someplace cold.
[151:17.67]I wonder if that's what it's like to die.
[151:21.35]Your Highness, I... You came to help me too?
[151:25.51]Wait, Your Highness?
[151:27.49]Uh-oh.
[151:31.83]I guess you guys figured me out, huh?
[151:35.23]Sorry, Crono.
[151:35.77]I didn't mean to trick you.
[151:36.63]And there's the sad music.
[151:42.04]My name is really Nadia.
[151:44.12]My father's King Guardia 33.
[151:45.92]I just wanted to go to the fair and have fun like everybody else.
[151:51.39]But if you'd known who I really was, you wouldn't have shown me around the fair, would you?
[151:56.67]Yeah, I would have.
[152:00.07]Why not?
[152:02.62]Oh, Crono, that's why I like you.
[152:05.84]The real queen's safe, right?
[152:07.66]Let's go home.
[152:21.77]I love Marle's walk.
[152:24.07]She's got a great walk.
[152:25.09]Let's go.
[152:43.76]Frog.
[152:48.21]It was my presence here that endangered the queen.
[152:50.31]I can remain at this castle no more.
[153:01.52]Oh, that was bad.
[153:02.28]Hopefully the music still allowed anyone to hear that.
[153:04.94]Why did they even try to do that?
[153:06.22]Indeed, your resemblance to the queen is like... It was like Chewbacca.
[153:16.68]Maybe frogs aren't so bad after all.
[153:29.54]Maybe not.
[153:35.47]I think I got everything in here right.
[153:51.74]Somebody said would I ever play Chrono Cross though?
[153:55.66]I don't think so.
[153:56.52]At least on stream.
[154:10.56]Better than what she has on.
[154:16.99]So she's a healer I think too, right?
[154:20.19]Grog's a healer, she's a healer.
[154:22.09]She doesn't have any magic yet, really?
[154:44.77]I played Cross for two minutes and gave up because of the awful battle system.
[154:49.04]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[154:49.66]It's a mess.
[154:51.56]The story is a mess.
[154:53.00]The gameplay is a mess.
[154:54.06]Guys, if you don't know Chrono Cross, there are 40 playable characters in that game.
[155:02.42]40 party members you can potentially get.
[155:05.66]And it's so convoluted to pick up half of them.
[155:09.98]It is a total mess.
[155:12.68]Ooh, windspot.
[155:16.31]And like five of them are cool.
[155:20.19]I'd say like 15 of them are cool.
[155:23.09]20 of them are cool.
[155:29.81]I think they all have a reason to be interesting, but I agree that this is kind of just too much.
[155:36.39]That's why I like this better.
[155:37.35]This is a condensed... The game is... It's beginning, middle, end, 20 hours, 30 hours, and you're done.
[155:46.71]But Chrono Cross is just like, what the fuck do I need to do to get this character?
[155:51.35]Oh, by the way, if you don't do this right now, this very specific thing at this exact moment in the game, you have literally this screen or two to do it.
[156:02.40]You're never seeing this character ever again.
[156:06.26]So if you don't care about that, then a casual playthrough will just be fun.
[156:13.39]but it is kind of a mess.
[156:21.16]The music though, I think the soundtrack for Chrono Cross might be as good if not better than this one.
[156:27.92]It has some unbelievable tracks.
[156:35.79]They're both tied, but Toronto Cross does, I think, just edge it out very, very, very quick.
[156:42.60]Just a hair.
[156:46.92]Let me turn it down.
[156:57.85]Okay, so now we gotta try to go back to our time, but how?
[157:04.41]Who's here?
[157:17.51]I think I got everything here.
[157:26.27]It's funny that a lot of people's favorite games are RPGs, but they only play other games.
[157:31.99]I get what you're saying, yeah.
[157:34.13]I would consider this to be one of my favorite games of all time, but I don't really play that many RPGs.
[157:38.97]Really at all.
[157:41.20]It's kind of just this one.
[157:54.34]Well, turn-based RPGs.
[157:55.42]I guess that's more accurate.
[158:02.67]How could I forget Earthbound?
[158:03.59]Earthbound is wonderful.
[158:04.99]Maybe I'll play Earthbound one day.
[158:06.71]It's another great one to do.
[158:22.77]So how do we get home?
[158:25.00]Well, your highness, we... Please call me Marl.
[158:30.22]Well then, Marl, observe.
[158:35.19]Whoa.
[158:36.93]Looka, you're amazing.
[158:44.09]Sorry, I should be more humble in front of, uh... Enough already.
[158:48.06]I'm a princess, but what's that mean?
[158:49.62]I can't do anything special.
[158:53.08]Well, if you say so.
[159:01.70]Anyway, I call these distortions gates.
[159:04.56]They're basically portals to the same location in a different time.
[159:09.43]Gates are unstable.
[159:10.69]That's why they appear and disappear all the time.
[159:12.77]So I use the principle behind my telepod device to create this gate key.
[159:19.35]It's what's locking the gate in place.
[159:23.36]Why did this gate suddenly appear in the first place?
[159:27.18]Either the telepod had something to do with it, or something else made it.
[159:33.21]This is starting to sound complicated.
[159:34.45]Why don't we head back to our own time for now?
[159:38.53]Alright.
[159:38.93]We're coming.
[159:42.51]Let's go.
[159:49.76]Here we are.
[159:58.43]We made it.
[159:59.09]See you soon.
[160:29.93]Well, ready to escort me home.
[160:31.65]Let's go.
[160:39.14]Yeah, and everything worked out and now the game... We did it.
[160:43.50]It was a lot of fun.
[160:45.96]And... Yeah, that's kind of the end of the game.
[160:48.70]That's Chrono Trigger.
[160:49.66]It's... It's about going back and saving the princess.
[161:00.94]Go talk to mom.
[161:03.52]Oh, come look at my cat.
[161:04.66]Perhaps it's just my imagination.
[161:37.82]Oh, there's the thing.
[161:50.35]Don't you do something with this later.
[161:52.09]Am I crazy?
[161:53.65]Am I making that up?
[162:05.72]What do you mean later?
[162:06.35]I thought the game was over.
[162:08.01]Oh, I mean like the next Chrono Trigger 2.
[162:10.29]Uh, I definitely need this.
[162:37.48]another one of these another one of these yeah I need like a few of those how many of these do I own?
[162:55.30]five?
[162:55.64]a thousand for a mid-ether, why are those so expensive?
[163:11.42]I need more than that.
[163:18.12]I don't think I can even buy more than that.
[163:28.27]Oh, that was weird.
[163:29.01]It was just my controller being annoying.
[163:32.43]Uh, let's get to 10.
[163:42.63]Alright, now... Ribbon.
[163:47.77]Let's get the... That's cool.
[163:51.32]When did I get this?
[163:51.88]I don't remember even picking this up.
[163:59.34]Look at what's all down here.
[164:10.05]This is what the other continent is.
[164:14.36]Yeah, you can kind of just go wherever you want.
[164:21.17]The mayor's house.
[164:25.33]I run this town and I'm so rich I don't know what to do with it all.
[164:29.71]Give you ten gold if you spin around three times and cluck like a chicken.
[164:33.01]Fine.
[164:39.74]That was great.
[164:41.06]Here you go.
[164:41.56]Ten gold.
[164:42.14]Don't spend it all in one place.
[164:48.64]Dad loves money more than he loves me.
[164:50.24]Oh, man.
[164:55.04]I hate my dad more than anyone in the whole world.
[164:57.34]You're calling me a sellout?
[165:05.18]The children are slipping away from us.
[165:06.64]It's so painful to see.
[165:19.64]Everybody says daddy's greedy.
[165:21.10]That's not true, is it?
[165:22.24]Got some good shit up here.
[165:25.96]I'm not gonna be mad about that, right?
[165:51.31]I always found this so funny in RPGs, you can just go in people's houses and just open their fridge.
[165:56.99]You could do that in real life too.
[166:14.99]Yeah, but that's illegal.
[166:17.93]You can't do that.
[166:18.65]I want to get that chest back there.
[166:31.14]Friends let you open their fridge.
[166:34.32]Um, what's it from Herbian Enthusiasm?
[166:37.98]Oh, liquids are okay.
[166:39.36]Liquids are okay.
[166:43.64]Some monsters can coexist with humans.
[166:45.26]Take that piano player, for instance.
[166:54.51]I'm the piano man.
[166:55.55]What do you want me to play?
[166:57.01]Play me something upbeat.
[167:04.31]Start trashing the place.
[167:11.35]Damn.
[167:18.21]Holy shit.
[167:19.39]He's gone.
[167:19.87]Everyone's off to that festival.
[167:25.44]Bunch of lazy socks.
[167:28.36]I'm the piano man.
[167:31.77]Let's... something sad.
[167:43.56]I got some spiced jerky, but I've been saving it for a special occasion.
[167:46.42]I might let some go for, say, 9900 gold.
[167:52.24]Oh, I think this is like a weird item.
[167:59.80]I think I need this for something.
[168:03.10]Figures.
[168:08.05]It's more than I have.
[168:13.43]Professional vibe killer.
[168:14.99]I can take the ferry.
[168:22.58]I want to ride the ferry.
[168:23.52]Get that off the screen.
[168:28.60]I take the ferry every chance I get.
[168:29.92]A one-way ticket is 10 gold.
[168:33.18]Nope.
[168:44.86]We're good out here Dr. Luca Hmm, reducing the form factor of a bipedal robot without compromising balance is tougher than I thought I'll chrono hurry up and escort the princess back to the castle
[169:12.53]I always loved this thing when I was younger.
[169:13.83]I had no idea what this was, but it looked... I just wanted to touch it.
[169:18.54]I wanted to be... I wanted to stand inside of this.
[169:20.22]Or be, like, near it.
[169:21.38]Damn, Luca, you got a big house.
[169:39.09]Luca and Tabin are always off tinkering on their latest inventions.
[169:44.98]I bought you this apple with what we earned today.
[169:46.96]Oh, you're so thoughtful.
[169:53.08]What a giga chap.
[169:57.16]Takes care of, takes care of his woman.
[170:12.30]Apple delivery.
[170:16.80]First of all, thank you.
[170:31.91]Appreciate that.
[170:43.57]Uh, favorite PlayStation 1 game is... Oh, this is going to sound crazy.
[170:51.70]But, okay.
[170:52.82]Rapper the Rapper.
[170:54.48]Rapper the Rapper.
[170:57.54]Uh, Heart of Darkness.
[171:03.12]Um... No, not Crash.
[171:10.52]I've got to really think about it.
[171:14.29]Probably maybe Resident Evil.
[171:15.87]Resident Evil 1 is like a great... that era in a nutshell.
[171:22.54]Mega Man Legends is up there too.
[171:23.84]Yeah, that's great as well.
[171:28.42]Tony Hawk.
[171:29.38]I would say Tony Hawk 2, which was... Dreamcast?
[171:37.32]PlayStation 2?
[171:44.50]I want to get levels here.
[171:45.46]What about Pepsi Man?
[171:53.26]Pepsi Man was pretty cool.
[171:54.26]I want to see what this does.
[171:58.33]This is a combo skill.
[172:04.51]That's a great heal.
[172:06.09]Alright, I gotta remember that.
[172:08.31]Kingdom Hearts.
[172:15.66]Kingdom Hearts was PS2 though.
[172:18.46]We're talking PS1.
[172:20.26]Uh, Twisted Metal.
[172:22.60]That's definitely up there.
[172:23.88]The original Twisted Metal.
[172:26.82]Metal Gear Solid, the original is up there, yeah.
[172:36.64]Wait.
[172:38.58]Make sure I get everything.
[172:39.32]I don't want to miss any items.
[172:48.48]One of these again.
[172:49.04]You're just jealous of Crash Bandicoot?
[172:59.45]Well, Crash Bandicoot is.
[173:00.59]I mean, it's good.
[173:06.03]It's good.
[173:09.72]Kingsfield 1 and 2.
[173:10.60]I have to play the Kingsfield games, honestly.
[173:18.69]I feel like there's an appreciation to have for them now.
[173:22.92]Princess Nadia.
[173:26.04]Are you alright?
[173:27.28]Where on Earth have you been?
[173:28.32]We'd heard you were abducted.
[173:30.26]We had soldiers coming through the entire kingdom for you.
[173:35.65]You back there.
[173:36.69]You're the one, are you?
[173:37.79]Thought you'd kidnap the princess?
[173:41.01]No, no, Crono.
[173:43.01]Oh, seize him.
[173:43.79]Seize the filthy terrorist.
[173:45.23]He deceived our princess and plotted to overthrow the crown.
[173:49.36]No, no, no, no, that's... Get him!
[173:52.03]I remember that, um... We need to have way higher security now.
[174:02.25]After what we did.
[174:04.58]Consequences.
[174:06.38]Stop this right now!
[174:07.56]Yes!
[174:11.24]What are you fools doing?
[174:13.72]But Her Highness the Princess said...
[174:17.47]It doesn't matter what she said.
[174:19.03]Seize him!
[174:21.69]Crota!
[174:29.48]Great song.
[174:39.03]I, your chancellor, shall serve as prosecutor.
[174:44.75]I, Pierre, represent the defense.
[174:51.78]Members of the court, I will now bring forth the defendant Crono, who is charged with the abduction of Princess Nadia.
[175:05.90]What shall be his fate?
[175:07.30]To burn at the stake, or perhaps to feel the tickler, or hang upside down?
[175:11.44]Or shall we employ the guillotine?
[175:19.12]The choice is yours, good jurors.
[175:21.08]Now let us begin.
[175:27.45]We shall first hear the testimony of the defense.
[175:33.19]Crono was charged with premeditated abduction of royalty.
[175:35.95]The question is, how could he be guilty of a crime that never occurred?
[175:43.08]The prosecution would have you believe that the defendant kidnapped the princess.
[175:47.32]However, the truth is quite to the contrary.
[175:50.98]Not only was there meeting a coincidence, but it was the princess herself who asked Crono if she could join him.
[176:00.62]Is that true?
[176:01.26]Who was responsible for initiating contact?
[176:05.37]It was me.
[176:05.99]I fucked up.
[176:08.17]I ran into her.
[176:08.77]I was supposed to let her run into you.
[176:12.91]I did it.
[176:14.05]I have to be truthful.
[176:17.91]Just lie?
[176:18.53]If she spoke first.
[176:24.27]Just blame Marle?
[176:25.75]No, I have to be truthful.
[176:32.40]I did.
[176:34.92]Indeed, the defendant deliberately approached the princess pretending it was an accident.
[176:44.62]Yep.
[176:45.74]Ow.
[176:50.44]Having subdued the princess, the defendant then coerced her into visiting Luca's little sideshow.
[176:56.11]There were countless witnesses to this.
[176:58.93]Shortly thereafter, both the princess and the defendant vanished.
[177:02.09]If that is not criminal abduction, I don't know what is.
[177:08.53]Several other acts have also been brought to my attention that call the defendant's character into question.
[177:15.66]Objection.
[177:16.26]This cannot possibly have any relevance to the case.
[177:21.29]Care to respond, Chancellor?
[177:24.95]Perrault's character is at the very core of this case, Your Honor.
[177:27.75]This evidence will show that his testimony cannot be trusted.
[177:31.93]Very well.
[177:32.93]We have nothing to hide.
[177:36.03]I would like to call the witness who can vouch for the defendant's good character.
[177:45.73]Stealer.
[177:46.75]Yeah.
[177:48.33]That man brought me my kitty.
[177:51.79]Thank you, mister.
[177:55.68]How about that?
[177:56.90]The man before you is a fine, upstanding youth.
[178:00.20]He deserves to be honored, not put on trial.
[178:04.57]Phew.
[178:05.59]Looks like they're buying it.
[178:10.77]Have you ever stolen anything?
[178:14.43]Uh...
[178:16.52]I have.
[178:18.22]See, he admits it.
[178:19.38]This man clearly lacks morals.
[178:30.39]That's him.
[178:31.51]That's the thief who ate my lunch.
[178:33.93]Right off the table.
[178:36.11]My dear wife worked all morning to make that meal for me.
[178:41.55]And he ate it twice!
[178:43.77]She had to bring it to me again!
[178:45.27]This guy sucks!
[178:54.24]Stealing from a helpless, hard-working citizen who only wished to enjoy the fair.
[178:59.44]How could anyone sympathize with such a ruffian?
[179:04.68]The real issue here is motive.
[179:06.32]Was there any motive for this good youth to kidnap Princess Nadia?
[179:10.40]No, there was none.
[179:14.18]Pardon me, but I believe the motive was quite clear.
[179:16.70]Greed.
[179:18.32]If fortune did tempt you, did it not?
[179:20.91]Fuck.
[179:23.05]It's because I didn't check on her first.
[179:24.65]I went right for the pendant.
[179:32.59]But no, that's not true.
[179:35.23]Are you sure you weren't in the least bit tempted?
[179:37.93]Alright, maybe just a little bit.
[179:42.44]Nothing more, Your Honor.
[179:43.34]The prosecution rests.
[179:48.46]Fuck, why did I just lie again?
[179:49.78]I had to be truthful.
[179:52.88]Okay, when you bump into her, if you don't check on her first, if you go to the pendant first... Look, they're gonna fry me anyways, guys, okay?
[180:02.31]I'm getting the chair for this.
[180:06.23]Members of the jury, is it time for a verdict?
[180:08.19]If you believe the defendant guilty, stand to the left.
[180:10.82]Innocent, to the right.
[180:16.78]Guilty.
[180:23.50]Guilty.
[180:30.88]Not guilty.
[180:37.64]Guilty.
[180:45.11]Not guilty.
[180:49.11]I love the realistic depictions of people in the crowd, it's great.
[180:53.03]Guilty.
[180:59.76]Not guilty.
[181:04.75]That's it.
[181:06.37]Order in the court.
[181:07.86]Order!
[181:08.30]I don't think I would have to hear a verdict from a junior minister.
[181:16.82]The defendant has been found guilty as charged.
[181:18.70]He is to be placed in solitary confinement for a period of three days, after which he will be executed for his crime.
[181:29.55]Take him away!
[181:34.57]Stop!
[181:36.03]Princess Nadia!
[181:41.35]That's quite enough, young lady.
[181:44.23]But father... All I asked was for you to remain at the castle and behave like a princess.
[181:50.63]What's done is done.
[181:51.81]Even royalty must obey the laws of the land.
[181:55.53]Leave the rest up to the Chancellor and forget about your little escapade in town.
[182:01.77]We are through here.
[182:06.96]This man is a seditionist who meant to overthrow our kingdom, and we will find out what happens to him.
[182:36.59]After we come back from a break.
[182:38.03]Because I want to get up and pee.
[182:40.24]And we have an ad break.
[182:43.64]So we'll find out what happens.
[182:45.80]Just everyone stand here for three minutes.
[182:47.72]I'll be right back.
[182:55.92]I think Otto wants to, I think, go out too.
[182:57.69]So I'll take care of Otto as well.
[182:59.67]Did you go outside?
[183:01.61]Yeah, he did.
[183:01.87]Alright.
[183:03.75]See you in a minute.
[188:57.64]Hello?
[188:59.74]Want to make a tea?
[189:02.45]Haven't had one tonight.
[189:04.29]I'm sorry I left you with this very dramatic, intense music.
[189:07.29]I just realized.
[189:08.07]This is the type of music loop that Polk would put in House Flipper.
[189:26.23]Okay, are we good?
[189:28.27]I already see the conclusion of this act here.
[189:30.51]Getting thrown in jail.
[189:38.12]You ever think that there's 12,000 people that know you're in the bathroom?
[189:42.52]Eh, not really.
[189:43.80]I don't really think too much about it.
[189:52.29]Okay, let's go.
[189:57.08]He's been found guilty by trial.
[189:58.68]I trust him to your care.
[190:00.94]Can't wait to just bop this guy in the back of the head and just immediately escape.
[190:07.44]Oh, he just did that to me.
[190:09.58]So this is the monster who abducted the princess?
[190:13.32]His execution is three days hence.
[190:16.88]See that he is still here to attend it?
[190:20.68]Yes, sir.
[190:22.57]Guards.
[190:27.03]Take the prisoner away.
[190:38.84]Fuck.
[190:39.22]I'm glad they left a save point.
[190:48.59]I don't think I have any equipment, do I?
[190:54.89]No.
[190:56.09]I get all my shit still, don't worry.
[191:05.13]Your hair could grow out to be like Rapunzel's?
[191:09.83]No.
[191:10.79]I don't think so.
[191:11.81]Hey, at least they give me a coffee.
[191:12.83]That's nice of them.
[191:19.98]Dude, this jail cell is not even that bad.
[191:21.36]You get free healing?
[191:26.55]Pipe down.
[191:31.07]Pipe down, you.
[191:35.25]Oh, how many times do I have to tell that filthy?
[191:37.97]If he won't quiet down, I'll quiet him down.
[191:40.19]Open the door.
[191:48.66]Ow.
[191:53.14]Eh.
[191:53.98]That's what you get for not doing what you're told.
[192:02.70]Where do you think you're going?
[192:06.29]Oh, why does he have a sword?
[192:08.65]And why is his sword better than both of our swords?
[192:22.23]We got this standard-issue shit.
[192:23.79]He's got this, like, bronze blade.
[192:37.45]Alright.
[192:39.85]Mm-hmm.
[192:46.21]Okay.
[192:47.21]I want to get in there.
[192:52.77]You got to get the free coffee.
[192:54.85]It's free health.
[193:06.07]Shit.
[193:08.82]How do I get it to go all the way?
[193:09.68]Hmm.
[193:35.68]I think you open this from somewhere else.
[193:40.07]Wouldn't a bronze blade suck?
[193:43.52]Maybe.
[193:46.40]Yeah, I don't think I can get it through here.
[193:48.22]Alright, there's like little weird guys.
[193:58.29]Gotta wait.
[193:58.69]Got ya.
[194:12.14]Why are you so judgmental?
[194:15.43]Sorry you had to read that one chat.
[194:17.33]I don't think I even saw it.
[194:18.13]Whatever it was.
[194:20.81]You got it quick.
[194:24.01]Let's go top left.
[194:31.53]Oh, not you, other chatters.
[194:33.23]Oh, okay.
[194:34.89]Oh, no.
[194:35.69]He didn't make it.
[194:41.76]I wasn't here in time.
[194:43.28]What the fuck?
[194:54.37]Oh, shit.
[194:54.61]See, that's what I mean.
[195:04.80]Attacking two times like that?
[195:07.54]I think that can still happen on the wait mode, but
[195:11.94]I'm going to pretend I can't.
[195:17.78]Shit.
[195:23.74]Bro is playing a turn-based game.
[195:25.64]LOL.
[195:26.36]Why did you just LOL?
[195:35.08]LOL?
[195:35.76]For what?
[195:41.64]Let me go down first.
[195:42.38]I think I got everything in there.
[195:49.27]I'll go down.
[196:03.08]Hello?
[196:05.72]I think I didn't even try.
[196:17.19]Ooh, yeah.
[196:19.43]Ooh, whatever.
[196:20.49]A mid potion.
[196:28.92]Mid potion.
[196:29.52]I think that's all I can do, right?
[196:40.26]Oh, it's mid.
[196:40.84]Uh-oh.
[196:47.69]So you're the ones gone and slipped to sell, eh?
[196:52.85]Oh shit.
[197:00.62]That always sounds so lame when they miss.
[197:11.64]Come on.
[197:14.28]Good.
[197:17.37]They don't pay me enough for this shit.
[197:26.94]You playing on easy?
[197:28.12]There is no difficulty.
[197:30.70]Actually, one would tell you I'm playing on the hard mode.
[197:44.46]There he is.
[197:55.39]Every game is hard mode with you?
[197:56.73]Uh, some games are harder than others.
[198:09.44]I beat Millenia on stream.
[198:14.38]Like... I mean, I used Tish, but... We like to just... We'll just rewrite history and just pretend like I didn't do it.
[198:28.37]Okay, I think... I gotta go the- I'm gonna go the other way.
[198:38.65]I wanna get that cell.
[198:40.05]How do I get it?
[198:45.47]Up here?
[198:45.79]Do I get in here later?
[199:06.42]You gotta climb from another room.
[199:13.78]Hold the back of that other cell.
[199:14.85]I wonder if you just have to keep progressing.
[199:24.70]Yeah, the lever doesn't open it all the way.
[199:36.80]Game is 30 years old.
[199:38.00]Ooh, thanks.
[199:51.94]Oh yeah, definitely.
[199:52.60]Okay.
[199:53.06]So I go up this way.
[199:54.30]Shit.
[199:56.08]I got caught.
[199:58.55]These guys are easy.
[199:59.15]It's fine.
[200:17.33]I want to make sure I don't miss anything this way.
[200:23.40]Damn it.
[200:24.54]I'm playing with one hand.
[200:26.20]Sorry.
[200:28.02]I'm drinking a nice peppermint tea in the other one.
[200:49.72]Yeah.
[200:50.52]Alright, here we go.
[200:52.00]Oh no.
[200:52.34]You're gonna save this guy.
[200:58.84]Help me, please.
[201:00.60]Free him from the guillotine.
[201:01.90]Yes.
[201:10.34]Thank you.
[201:10.68]That was close.
[201:12.10]I'm Fritz.
[201:13.48]My father runs the market in Truce.
[201:15.66]Stop by if you're ever in the area.
[201:18.89]New friend.
[201:22.77]If I could just get in there and just... What the fuck is wrong with people?
[201:34.60]Think about this for a second.
[201:37.14]We used to put people into shit like this and slam it closed and be like, yeah!
[201:43.16]Fucking put spikes through his eyes.
[201:48.31]That's so fucked up.
[201:53.02]Oh, I have an idea.
[201:54.30]What we're going to do is we're going to put you inside of this bronze bowl and light it on, burn it from the bottom and boil you inside of it.
[202:11.59]It's like insane.
[202:13.41]Imagine being in one of those things.
[202:14.91]Imagine being in the Iron Maiden.
[202:17.03]Like, what do you even think for your last thought?
[202:21.68]Like, oh, shit.
[202:24.15]Here it comes.
[202:38.39]Come on, show yourself.
[202:43.03]Open.
[202:56.68]I imagine you probably didn't die right away either.
[202:58.46]You probably just sat there with just these massive holes in you.
[203:15.65]The Iron Maiden wasn't real?
[203:21.31]Did we just make up a bunch of crazy shit that they did to scare us from ever doing it again?
[203:26.50]You see what they did is they would hold you upside down and they would carve your face off and they would tear your skin off and then they would dip you in fucking... They would dip you in like Dairy Queen dip.
[203:39.02]And not the cherry one, not the good one.
[203:40.98]The gross one.
[203:41.63]Ooh.
[203:53.67]The bronze bowl was real.
[203:54.89]Is there any way to get out of here?
[204:11.10]Iron Maiden wasn't real, but there were way worse torture methods that were.
[204:18.61]Imagine that as like your job.
[204:22.48]Your job is to come up with the most creatively awful ways to torture people.
[204:30.60]I mean, first of all, what I would do is I would make sure that their eyes were bent.
[204:39.87]Oh, here we go.
[204:40.37]Did this kill me?
[204:48.63]No, okay.
[205:04.42]There we go.
[205:06.67]Shelter.
[205:14.07]Nice.
[205:19.76]1500 gold.
[205:20.44]Holy shit, that's a lot.
[205:25.32]Um, yeah.
[205:27.54]Excuse me.
[205:29.41]Silver sword.
[205:38.36]I don't think I can even open this from here.
[205:55.24]Pitch black room with rats which just bite you?
[206:02.37]The man who invented the brazen bull died via that method.
[206:05.33]They used his own invention against him.
[206:11.00]That's just diabolical.
[206:13.36]You sit there going like, why?
[206:14.70]Why did I make it so fucked up?
[206:25.69]I at least should have added cup holders in here.
[206:35.47]Rats weren't real.
[206:40.19]Creator of the guillotine was killed by the guillotine.
[206:42.05]Yeah, that's so... I haven't saved the game either, so I gotta actually be careful.
[206:53.41]There he is!
[207:03.50]The guillotine was made to be as humane as possible.
[207:11.24]That's so fucked up.
[207:18.56]I mean, if you think about it, back then it wasn't like, oh, we have this mixture of chemicals we can use, or we're going to give you this or give you that, or we're going to kill you like this.
[207:30.96]I guess back in the day, that really probably was.
[207:34.18]Just remove your head from your shoulders instantly.
[207:59.62]Somebody help!
[208:09.40]Luca to the rescue.
[208:11.02]Oh no, I came to rescue you.
[208:14.07]Oh, looks like you didn't need my help after all.
[208:15.73]Oh well.
[208:17.55]Well, we better not stick around too long.
[208:19.07]Let's go.
[208:24.05]He's unconscious.
[208:24.89]Need a mid-potion.
[208:28.23]Actually, five of them.
[208:31.55]This guy has been carrying a lot of shit.
[208:35.36]A classified document has been left lying on the floor.
[208:37.98]Would you like to read it?
[208:40.32]Dragon Tank Design Specifications.
[208:42.16]Attention Warden of the Guardia Castle Prisons.
[208:45.46]The head of the tank is equipped with the capacity to repair damage done to the body, an ingenious Marvel of engineering.
[208:52.69]The head has also been enhanced with a shield to prevent damage by lightning and fire, leaving it vulnerable only to attacks with weapons such as swords and pistols.
[209:02.47]What's wrong, Otto?
[209:02.83]What's the matter, do you need something?
[209:06.73]In short, your tank should be effectively invincible, provided no crazed lunatic gets the bright idea to run up and try to hack away with its sword.
[209:13.80]Do you need something?
[209:18.58]Yeah, do you need something?
[209:20.44]You might be kinda hungry.
[209:21.10]You should run outside.
[209:24.04]Let me take a quick BRB.
[209:28.30]Let me take care of Mr. Otto.
[209:29.36]I'm not gonna run ads or anything, I'm just gonna- I'll be back in like two minutes.
[209:35.44]What are you, eating some?
[209:38.06]Let's go.
[212:26.62]Why do you use the Otto voice when you talk to Otto?
[212:28.44]He probably thinks you're mocking the way he talks.
[212:30.48]I'm just one of those people that a dog is just... A dog is this.
[212:37.18]It doesn't matter.
[212:40.76]A cat is this.
[212:42.84]But a dog is this.
[212:44.48]And yeah, I'm one of those fucking weirdos that does that.
[212:57.13]uh this is a boss coming up and if we had the head heals the body I remember the difficulty of the game doesn't really ramp up till probably like a little bit after this silly dog voice and slutty cat voice
[213:31.08]That's funny.
[213:32.26]Okay, I think we're good.
[213:34.60]I could use a shelter, but I think I'm fine.
[213:38.72]Let's do it.
[213:49.32]What was that?
[213:50.12]The dragon tank.
[214:01.56]Just making sure the music's in the right spot, because it's going to be a banger.
[214:11.12]Let's go!
[214:20.83]Now we're going to have... Bruno's going to hit the head, and Luca's going to attack the wheels.
[214:26.79]Good start.
[214:40.49]Ooh, that actually hurts a lot.
[214:49.37]Let's give mid potion to... yeah.
[214:54.24]Good.
[214:54.52]200, holy shit, that's a much... I thought it was 100.
[215:08.17]Maybe we should go for that.
[215:08.75]Maybe we should go for the wheels first.
[215:10.60]Now Chrono Attack head, Luka go for wheels, because then he can't do the charge anymore.
[215:16.38]Gonna heal Luka.
[215:21.65]Uh-oh.
[215:26.25]He's dead?
[215:27.27]Nope.
[215:34.56]Thank goodness.
[215:39.53]Cut that wheel off.
[215:47.98]I didn't really do that much to the head at all.
[215:55.91]You know, just focus the wheel, focus the wheel.
[216:12.36]Focus the head, focus the head, focus the head, focus the head.
[216:20.96]Shit, I didn't wanna do that.
[216:26.92]I gotta fix that, I gotta stay in my lane.
[216:34.48]There we go, okay.
[216:37.57]Do that a couple more times.
[216:44.73]I want you to give a potion to Chrono, and then I need you to do Cyclone again to the head.
[216:49.77]Let's go.
[216:52.85]Shit.
[216:59.35]I just have to keep the pressure up.
[217:06.77]I need a crit is what I need.
[217:09.77]I think Luke's dead.
[217:13.35]Yep.
[217:20.85]Okay, so I gotta focus the head first.
[217:25.84]I can bring her back.
[217:41.59]Come on, do it!
[217:46.19]Yes!
[217:46.43]Alright, we're good.
[217:47.37]Alright, now focus head.
[217:59.16]I need a crit.
[218:00.48]I have not seen a single crit.
[218:05.36]Yes!
[218:05.70]Alright, no more heals.
[218:11.93]Is it gonna hurt?
[218:14.87]Is the head resistant to fire?
[218:19.61]No, we're good.
[218:20.13]Alright, don't get cocky here.
[218:22.75]I need to heal.
[218:32.20]Crit.
[218:33.30]Yes!
[218:37.28]Oh, all the doubters!
[218:39.52]He's gonna die to the dragon tank.
[218:42.62]Really?
[218:46.38]I think we just gotta unload.
[219:02.29]Oh, don't.
[219:02.81]Uh-oh.
[219:03.71]This is actually going to fall apart here if I don't heal Chrono right now.
[219:11.13]Okay, I'm fine.
[219:16.15]Let's do Fire World.
[219:21.16]GG.
[219:33.41]Alright, that could have been bad.
[219:57.41]Classic Looney Tunes routine.
[220:05.08]Don't fool yourselves into thinking you'll get away with this.
[220:21.61]They're escaping!
[220:22.27]We've got no choice, we have to try to plow through.
[220:26.09]Get the fuck out of my way.
[220:33.99]They're escaping!
[220:36.72]stop that right now princess nadia that man is my friend and you will treat him as such but your highness I bet 52k and I only got 3k from that wow there wasn't very many people that didn't believe or that yeah you refuse to obey my orders
[221:07.32]No, forgive me, my lady.
[221:09.94]Hold it right there.
[221:17.60]The Super Nintendo.
[221:19.96]Motion up and down.
[221:21.94]Tween.
[221:22.86]Fast.
[221:24.06]I'm angry.
[221:25.26]Get on your knees.
[221:26.14]His Grace King Guardia 33 comes before you.
[221:34.55]Father.
[221:37.29]Silence, Nadia.
[221:38.41]Your duties come before your whims.
[221:41.18]You're a princess before all else.
[221:44.68]No, I'm not.
[221:45.26]I'm a person first and a princess second.
[221:49.48]All these little excursions of yours outside the castle seem to be having a bad influence on you.
[221:54.96]It's not influence, it's common sense.
[221:58.24]Nadia.
[222:00.49]I can't live in this stupid castle anymore.
[222:02.35]I'm leaving.
[222:06.39]Princess Nadia.
[222:09.69]Come on, Chrono.
[222:10.69]Let's get out of here.
[222:14.83]Don't just stand there after them.
[222:22.22]Oh, Nadia.
[222:26.32]Alright, don't lose him.
[222:33.36]There's nowhere left to run.
[222:36.49]Come along quietly.
[222:37.41]Let's get out of here.
[222:46.59]A gate!
[222:59.66]Come on, let's use it.
[223:01.74]Come on, we have no idea where it'll take us.
[223:03.32]We might not even be able to get back.
[223:07.16]Who cares?
[223:07.72]Anywhere is better than here.
[223:12.87]Princess Anadia.
[223:19.92]This is totally irrational, you know.
[223:21.38]Let's go.
[223:26.96]Does this... Okay, is this the... Well, let's not spoil it.
[223:30.73]Forget where this one is.
[223:36.95]They disappeared?
[223:38.15]Holy shit.
[223:41.87]My streamer is cooked?
[223:42.71]You're talking about me?
[223:46.16]Oh, it is this place.
[223:50.00]Favorite character alert.
[223:59.02]There's no way the Chancellor can get us here.
[224:02.33]But where are we?
[224:06.69]The civilization here seems pretty advanced.
[224:10.01]It almost looks like we're in another world.
[224:26.09]Oh.
[224:27.17]Hey.
[224:28.13]Bros.
[224:29.63]Bros, where are we?
[224:36.95]got any cash?
[224:48.07]is this stuff real?
[224:50.63]never seen money like this before oh well I have some good stuff for you this is expensive
[225:06.68]Oh, this is the money sink.
[225:07.79]Alright, I'm gonna get... Yeah, I'm gonna get three of them.
[225:13.27]Three of these.
[225:18.13]I got plenty of potions.
[225:31.64]Nothing better than the power glove yet.
[225:42.55]She was kind of lacking on damage in a way, so... Okay.
[225:59.09]Everybody's good.
[226:01.61]There goes all of my money.
[226:13.31]Maybe I should hold on to one of these because the other party members.
[226:18.23]Why is your thumbnail Marvel Rivals?
[226:23.43]What?
[226:37.87]It was that last week?
[226:43.49]If I just keep saving up money, someday it'll come in handy.
[226:46.03]That's what I tell myself anyway.
[226:47.29]There should still be some food at Eris Dome to the northeast.
[226:55.97]You can get through Site 16 alive.
[226:58.80]Inspectors that haunt the place can't be harmed by weapons like guns or blades.
[227:05.82]Bruce?
[227:07.08]Never heard of a dome by that name.
[227:08.52]This is Trandome.
[227:13.31]Looking for food, you won't find any here.
[227:17.01]Kingdom?
[227:17.87]Chancellor?
[227:18.43]Has the hunger driven you mad?
[227:22.88]This is an Enertron.
[227:24.78]You get a full night's sleep in a few seconds, but it won't do a thing for your hunger.
[227:31.28]Rest in the Enertron.
[227:36.22]HP and MP restored.
[227:37.30]And you're still just as hungry as before.
[227:45.14]That's so sad.
[227:52.12]Imagine getting like the vitality of whole rest.
[227:57.31]But it's just can't.
[227:58.65]There's no food.
[228:09.24]Banger dome.
[228:09.90]That's where I just was.
[228:10.70]Yeah.
[228:17.46]Beyond the Ruins.
[228:20.78]This area is really cool though.
[228:22.36]This is probably one of the coolest areas in the game.
[228:30.39]Like the screaming re from the... I love this place.
[228:35.95]It's so chunky and like crusty and ugly.
[229:00.08]Boost attack slash defense cannot control where... Oh, that's right.
[229:03.54]You can't... I can't tell them to do anything.
[229:07.25]They just go crazy.
[229:10.21]It's good, but it's really not great.
[229:12.73]I'll put it on Chrono, though.
[229:17.56]Just auto attack damage, yeah.
[229:19.84]On Chrono would be fine.
[229:20.60]Maybe on Luka.
[229:21.20]Let's try it.
[230:09.63]do you think do you think Ster is in this game um I would say I don't know luca I could see Ster being luca I could also see Ster being chrono
[230:41.60]What about me?
[230:43.50]This is my stream.
[230:44.76]You didn't even ask about me?
[230:45.80]Holy shit, that's a lot of damage.
[230:49.74]Frog.
[231:17.69]I could see that.
[231:31.78]Could be another character.
[231:33.56]It could be Robo.
[231:34.84]Robo's cool.
[231:36.42]I mean, that's one of my favorite characters in the game.
[231:39.52]There's a few others.
[231:42.10]I actually, I... I'm going to change up the party this time.
[231:45.72]Once I get everybody.
[231:53.67]You're the Chancellor.
[231:55.89]Oh yeah, because I did the voice where I went like this, and he's kind of small.
[232:05.64]Any character that has one of these personalities, it's me.
[232:10.54]What an awesome... I wish I lived in that period.
[232:13.92]I would be that guy.
[232:16.16]I would talk like that too.
[232:19.76]Walk around with a cane with a big gem inside of it or something.
[232:24.91]That'd be amazing.
[232:33.76]You said this last week.
[232:34.94]Yeah, but now I'm thinking even more about it.
[232:39.32]The time period?
[232:40.19]No, the time, the game, the time period.
[232:45.65]Another one of these.
[233:12.44]I already have one of these things.
[233:16.57]Usual party is usually Robo, Frog, I don't know, Robo, Frog, Magus.
[233:38.57]I kind of want to do... I'd like to do... What's her name?
[233:44.67]I don't want to do too many spoilers because, obviously.
[233:48.23]Did you spoil?
[233:51.91]No, you don't know what I'm talking about.
[233:56.61]Isla, yeah, that's the other one.
[233:58.95]I don't even know who that guy is.
[234:06.07]And by the way...
[234:08.23]It's not even possible.
[234:09.09]Unless you do the crazy specific shit to do it.
[234:14.72]It's not even possible.
[234:26.94]Not using Isla, I feel bad for you.
[234:34.41]Isla's really cool.
[234:36.01]I think I'll use Isla this time.
[235:01.39]He's got a lot of combos.
[235:03.83]Marle has a lot of great combos with Frog too, doesn't she?
[235:09.61]You kind of can't go wrong.
[235:11.05]There's a lot of interesting combinations.
[235:20.48]Slurp Kiss, yeah.
[235:30.99]We're almost at the part of the game that's going to make me probably get angry.
[235:36.30]Like, oh, you know what I'm talking about.
[235:37.62]Don't spoil it, but you know the one.
[235:39.96]And it kind of takes you out of the game in a really cool way.
[235:42.98]And I always forget about the sequence coming up here and it always makes me laugh and I always love it.
[235:54.29]I'm going to use magic on these guys.
[236:05.03]He's in Berserk mode.
[236:22.38]I would do Earthbound, yeah.
[236:23.29]We talked about it earlier.
[236:24.07]I would definitely do it eventually.
[236:32.16]I'm trying to get you for your 500 subs curls.
[236:35.04]What was your exercise gaining regimen?
[236:41.06]I ate cans of tuna fish like a cat.
[236:43.10]I just ate it out of the can.
[236:46.26]I would do a routine and then I would eat a can of tuna fish.
[237:03.99]Just right out of the can.
[237:06.57]No bullshit.
[237:07.21]No, no, that's one of the protein I wanted.
[237:09.25]I wanted the good fat and I wanted the protein.
[237:10.81]I love the clap.
[237:12.50]I also did.
[237:13.90]It was a lot of eggs.
[237:36.01]It's really hard for me to put weight on, though.
[237:38.37]It's one of the most difficult things in the world.
[237:42.09]I will try desperately to gain weight.
[237:44.15]It just won't happen.
[237:46.29]I could eat two or three thousand calories a day and I just burn it.
[237:48.68]My body just burns it.
[237:55.84]So... I started doing... I started eating... uh... tahini?
[238:07.24]I would take a spoonful of it.
[238:08.94]I would take a good spoonful of it before bed.
[238:21.14]Only a spoonful?
[238:21.76]Yeah, just straight tahini, oh yeah.
[238:25.46]It's one of the highest dense calorie foods in the world.
[238:29.15]I think one or two tablespoons of tahini, it's like 300 calories.
[238:32.97]It's a lot.
[238:38.38]Similar to peanut butter.
[238:39.90]I liked it a little better than peanut butter because peanut butter is kind of hard to eat.
[238:45.38]A full tablespoon of peanut butter is like... It's like sticky mush.
[238:52.92]Tahini was very easy for me to eat.
[238:58.18]I ate a lot of peanut butter as well, though.
[238:59.52]Let's do peanut butter banana smoothies, peanut butter chocolate smoothies with protein powder in it.
[239:08.57]Everybody's different, though.
[239:10.53]And... I wouldn't say that everything I was doing is something you probably should emulate.
[239:20.54]Because everybody's bodies are so different.
[239:22.44]Obviously, talking to a nutritionist or your doctor, too, would help.
[239:30.52]Yeah, I would do one to two tablespoons of tahini.
[239:33.08]I'd eat a lot of tuna fish.
[239:35.20]Tons of eggs.
[239:37.54]I would just do, I'd make 12 hard-boiled eggs.
[239:40.60]And that would, I would just eat them out of the jar.
[239:43.96]Stick them in the fridge.
[239:45.21]They were good for like three or four days.
[239:47.99]I would eat three or four of them a day in the morning.
[240:04.55]Don't get Mercury poisoning.
[240:05.75]I mean, I don't do this anymore.
[240:08.59]And I was okay.
[240:11.14]When I say I was eating a lot of tuna.
[240:13.66]I was eating a lot of tuna, but I wasn't eating like three, four, five cans a day.
[240:17.36]This was... Did I miss a grape?
[240:24.06]No, I got it.
[240:28.45]Greek yogurt.
[240:29.15]Yeah.
[240:31.17]I also, uh, Huel was really good too.
[240:33.15]At least not for, I mean, I didn't, this didn't exist back then.
[240:39.18]But I would probably imagine stuff like that's pretty good now.
[240:45.24]He's a Huel streamer.
[240:46.36]Oh yeah, I did move my mic away.
[240:49.38]Has there already been another hour?
[240:53.61]Damn.
[240:55.29]It's been four hours.
[240:56.31]I'm just kind of vibing.
[240:57.39]This is, I'm having a good time.
[241:07.37]engorging donuts I would say if you're trying to gain clean quality weight I don't think I don't think working out and then eating donuts is the is the way you should do it the reason why I like tuna fish is because it was it was a very highly packed with good fat and tons of protein now yeah Mercury Mercury Mercury Mercury you're gonna die of Mercury if you eat tuna fish I no just don't eat fucking 100 of them
[241:39.60]Salmon, too.
[241:40.12]Salmon's really great for that.
[241:46.15]The Christian Bale pre-filming Bateman diet.
[241:48.81]Tuna's gross?
[241:56.25]Well, then I would say you shouldn't eat it if you're trying to add some more protein into your life.
[242:10.18]Is there soy in Huel?
[242:11.92]Uh, no.
[242:14.68]I believe it is pea protein and tapioca.
[242:17.84]That's where it gets most of the density from.
[242:19.66]I will give you a full Huel ad when I get back.
[242:30.40]The PEA, PEA, you all know what I said.
[242:35.53]You little rascals.
[242:40.98]sardines too I love sardines that's a great sardines is a superfood sardines you could probably live off of them they have everything we'll talk about it in a minute uh back in uh like four minutes five minutes see you in a few minutes ads are gonna play right now see if you
[243:07.28]so so
[243:44.62]so so
[244:17.26]so so
[244:54.55]so so
[245:27.29]so so
[246:04.51]so so
[246:37.09]Thank you.
[247:14.83]How are you doing?
[247:21.50]Would you just chill?
[247:38.69]We're talking about how you only play with one.
[247:42.09]And oh, you're gonna say and I see what you're saying.
[247:55.80]Okay, so we're doing this.
[248:02.69]This is Erisdome.
[248:20.42]Who are you?
[248:24.80]Julia, why have you... Where have you come from?
[248:28.66]We just came from the other side of the ruins to the west.
[248:32.34]What did you say?
[248:32.88]Hey, we've got people who crossed the ruins.
[248:36.43]Are you serious?
[248:41.53]So there are people strong enough to fight those mutants.
[248:49.67]Dad is going to be back with some food soon.
[248:51.25]I don't know.
[248:57.17]My husband left for the food storage facility down below.
[248:59.39]We haven't seen him since.
[249:01.37]Protodome and an old abandoned factory site lie to the east.
[249:08.78]We can't get near them, though.
[249:10.12]Places are filled with robots running berserk.
[249:14.63]Pardon me, I didn't even tell you my name.
[249:16.27]I'm Dome, a descendant of the former director of this information center in the days when it was still one.
[249:22.47]This Dome substructure holds a supercomputer and a food storage facility.
[249:28.04]The robot guards are still active and will not let us through.
[249:32.12]Ironic, is it not?
[249:33.78]We starve right atop our own stores of food.
[249:43.97]You could reach the continent to the south through the sewers, but I wouldn't advise it.
[249:47.29]That's where Death Peak sits, the source of all this devastation.
[249:52.50]And besides, even someone as strong as you would never stand a chance against the mutants that live down in those sewers.
[250:03.25]As an old man living in a dome he built near Death Peak said he wanted to monitor it and talk about crackpots.
[250:20.61]Still hungry.
[250:25.59]Yes, I have money.
[250:26.73]I think I have everything I need from here.
[250:51.68]These people... Okay, so let's talk about Heal.
[250:55.70]So... It's very good.
[250:59.57]It definitely helped me the last... I want to say six months.
[251:06.67]But it is... It's a massive calorie bomb.
[251:09.49]It's like 400 calories in a bottle. ...
[251:26.48]But it's good, though.
[251:27.42]It's not... doesn't seem like there's very much junk in it.
[251:30.04]Well, there's no way of knowing what'll happen unless we try, right?
[251:47.52]Hmm.
[251:48.42]Nice to see such spirited young people for a change.
[251:52.16]Yeah, it's a total meal- full meal replacement, yeah.
[251:56.33]Is there anything else I can do up here first?
[251:58.05]I think there is.
[252:26.11]Fuel is expensive.
[252:28.61]Yeah, if you look at it through the lens of... It's a meal.
[252:35.59]Not necessarily like a drink.
[252:41.72]Outsiders better report to Crawley.
[252:48.22]I don't want to go in here just yet.
[252:53.82]Yeah, I guess I'll go down.
[252:57.97]And...
[253:16.87]Should I drink protein shakes before or after working out?
[253:20.44]You know, the book is kind of out on that, I think.
[253:24.46]I think most people would say after.
[253:28.02]There's like pre-workout and post-workout.
[253:30.68]I haven't been in the game for a long time.
[253:32.37]It's been a long time since I've been in that game.
[253:42.41]Usually it's after.
[253:45.10]Yeah, some people, somebody said, some people say it doesn't even matter.
[253:47.48]I usually did it, I did it after.
[253:53.99]Okay, this door needs a password.
[253:58.75]This is the door lock.
[254:03.93]Gotta clear out the fucking rats.
[254:13.77]Looks like we're officially moving into the late night crew here.
[254:18.03]Welcome to the late night crew.
[254:23.79]That's my favorite bug.
[254:26.03]Uh, bunny.
[254:30.50]It appears to be a decorative statue.
[254:32.02]A note is attached to it.
[254:33.98]Warning, anyone approaching the food stocks is subject to attack.
[254:47.54]Did you get comfortable?
[254:53.90]Oh my god, I forgot.
[254:55.86]Oh, that's not good.
[254:56.54]When did I just save?
[254:57.18]How long has it been since I saved?
[255:04.92]What is that?
[255:08.10]Tomorrow?
[255:08.74]Let's smash this thing.
[255:10.89]Oh no.
[255:13.45]I'm not ready for this.
[255:16.89]Chrono still has the Berserker thing on.
[255:18.49]Alright, focus the right one.
[255:24.10]Can I do the Hypno Wave thing or no?
[255:29.54]Just kill it.
[255:37.49]Nice drop, Colonel.
[255:42.43]Oof, that hurts.
[255:48.21]That's like a third of his whole health pool.
[255:49.69]Aw, give him some- he needs aura.
[255:56.45]He's dead!
[255:57.49]Oh my god, he's just spamming!
[256:12.95]Okay, I, I need more heals.
[256:14.39]Alright, I'm just gonna have... Marle's gonna heal.
[256:16.99]Okay, now we focus.
[256:19.97]Good.
[256:48.78]Shouldn't be, be too bad.
[256:49.32]This is not necessarily a hard boss.
[256:51.58]It's just... Uh-oh.
[256:54.87]Kill it.
[256:58.19]That's like a countdown on the screen.
[257:01.49]Everybody needs to be at full health, I think.
[257:05.07]Oh, fucking hurry up and do it before he does it.
[257:06.91]Oh my god.
[257:07.41]Oh god.
[257:22.42]Oh, it's revives the pods.
[257:23.70]I thought it was going to do an explosion.
[257:25.08]There we go again.
[257:28.74]Yeah, this is this was not that scary.
[257:35.28]Just looks scary.
[257:48.61]When I was younger.
[257:50.89]I remember.
[257:55.39]I remember being being so scared of everything in this game.
[258:02.95]There's a couple items I need to get down here.
[258:10.60]Is there not one?
[258:11.16]I thought there was an item.
[258:18.14]Oh, we're good.
[258:18.66]I'm just... Okay.
[258:20.48]This is what I do.
[258:31.70]Yuck, Something reeks.
[258:38.93]Everything's completely rotten.
[258:40.43]The refrigeration must have failed.
[258:45.05]Sad.
[258:46.63]Chrono, look.
[258:48.71]He's not breathing.
[258:49.71]Must have died down here.
[258:52.56]There's somethings something in his hand.
[258:53.54]What do you suppose this is?
[258:58.82]Looks like some kind of seed.
[259:00.02]A seed?
[259:03.73]Could it even grow in a place like this?
[259:10.45]A note is written on a soiled scrap of paper.
[259:13.87]That rat is more than just a statue.
[259:15.85]It knows the secret of this dome.
[259:17.98]Catch it.
[259:24.15]How we doing doing on health?
[259:24.97]I think we're fine.
[259:31.49]It's all spoiled.
[259:38.95]There, that must be the rat.
[259:39.87]It might run away.
[259:42.27]Run after it and press A to catch it.
[259:46.62]I got it you little shit.
[259:49.26]I got it.
[259:50.40]Squeak.
[259:50.84]I give up.
[259:51.34]I'll tell you everything.
[259:52.84]Press A, Y, and then B to activate the switch once you hear the sound.
[259:55.96]Squeak.
[259:58.14]I forgot it already.
[259:58.78]What is it?
[259:59.18]A, Y, B?
[260:16.08]There we go.
[260:18.54]Monsters!
[260:45.55]47 damage, killed one of the rats and lit up my spring.
[261:12.37]Yeah, it's funny this.
[261:14.33]There's some stuff in this game that was really eerie.
[261:19.84]I don't know how much we'll see of it.
[261:22.22]I'll try to show some of the cool stuff.
[261:24.92]But some of the later boss designs are just wild.
[261:28.60]It's a very wacky game.
[261:35.08]Ready to fight any of these, I don't think.
[261:42.64]Feel my mouth on your neck.
[261:47.04]That's loud.
[262:00.19]What's the what?
[262:00.65]Okay, what is considered the best Final Fantasy for the Super Nintendo?
[262:06.08]Six?
[262:07.96]Five?
[262:11.53]I've never played Six.
[262:12.75]I don't think I've ever gotten through any of it.
[262:15.07]I remember really, really early on trying it.
[262:32.42]This must be the supercomputer.
[262:35.88]Good, it's still operational.
[262:36.90]If we run a search on temporal distortions, we might just find our gate.
[262:49.98]East of here.
[262:57.81]All the way over there.
[263:07.89]Protodome.
[263:10.48]Leave it to Luka who'd have thought this machine could tell us something like that.
[263:15.59]Say, what does this button do?
[263:18.94]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[263:20.22]Now we're all dead.
[263:21.30]1999 AD.
[263:21.42]Visual record of the day of Lavos.
[264:00.01]Everything is destroyed.
[264:09.85]Yeah, that was a scary scene.
[264:12.94]What was that?
[264:15.52]Lavos, is that what destroyed the world?
[264:18.48]Then this really is our future.
[264:19.72]No, it can't be.
[264:21.63]I won't believe it.
[264:24.55]This...
[264:28.16]This can't be the way the world ends.
[264:35.76]Chrono.
[264:37.86]Hey, that's right, we can change it, right?
[264:39.18]We can change history, just like Chrono did when he saved me.
[264:41.56]We have to.
[264:43.77]Right, Luca?
[264:44.29]Right?
[264:52.49]Yeah, I guess so.
[264:54.95]And fortunately, we've got gates that will let us move through time.
[264:59.79]what do you say Chrono?
[265:02.54]ah I'm just gonna load up the box season one of Breaking Bad it's gonna take that long anyways to go through it all and then One Piece and then Naruto and then JoJo's Bizarre Adventure let's do it let's save the world
[265:33.37]Back to our own time and see if we can find any more information about Lavos.
[265:39.22]Next stop, Protodome.
[265:43.36]We're gonna save the world.
[265:45.62]Just you wait.
[265:48.92]Yeah, so world gets destroyed.
[265:50.32]What year is it in this year?
[265:53.94]20... Like 2100?
[265:54.54]2200? 2300.
[266:05.55]It's a very loud sound, but I want to equip items.
[266:14.74]Shit.
[266:16.84]I love how it kills the person that moves and it's always one of them.
[266:40.53]Can you find Luigi in your chat?
[266:57.56]He's like, where's Waldo?
[267:02.52]Is somebody just being Luigi here?
[267:10.94]Shit, I didn't want to touch him.
[267:12.00]There he is.
[267:12.30]I found him.
[267:18.49]There he is.
[267:39.03]I'm trying to remember when... I think it's... I don't remember and I'm not going to even talk about it because I really don't remember.
[268:01.80]The Berserker ring is cool, but not right now.
[268:16.77]Allure.
[268:17.97]Confused.
[268:22.22]Actually... I might as well just do this now.
[268:30.68]It's a good late night healthy snack.
[268:33.99]It depends on.
[268:37.81]Eating anything really that late late is not great.
[268:40.25]I mean, I do it almost every night, but you know, I think everybody does.
[268:43.88]I like peanuts.
[268:51.21]Peanuts with the shell.
[268:52.95]You see that kind of tangible.
[268:56.64]You know, a thing you do with your hands.
[268:58.74]Although that's kind of a mess, so what a terrible thing to do in bed.
[269:02.12]I don't know where you're eating these.
[269:07.56]He likes foraging.
[269:14.07]I like popcorn, too.
[269:16.39]I like hummus.
[269:20.23]Roasted, yeah.
[269:21.95]Eating a bunch of shells in bed.
[269:23.37]Just dumping them all over your bed, all over you.
[269:27.70]That would be a nightmare.
[269:29.28]You would never get it all up.
[269:31.70]And what did you discover?
[269:34.82]This is our future.
[269:37.76]Hmm.
[269:40.76]Who cares?
[269:41.54]Where's the food?
[269:42.36]Yeah, honestly, I'd say the same thing.
[269:47.13]I'd be like, yeah, but who gives a shit?
[269:52.99]This was the only thing left.
[269:55.61]A seed.
[269:58.69]You don't know how long that Ener-Tron will hold out.
[270:02.39]That seed might be your only hope.
[270:07.03]How scary.
[270:11.11]Imagine a single seed is the only food that you have left.
[270:15.48]That thing, you need to, that thing better grow up.
[270:20.00]Having to like patient zero for all food is that seed.
[270:28.68]Anyway, just try to stay alive.
[270:29.98]Don't give up.
[270:30.60]We won't either.
[270:35.74]You're a strange bunch.
[270:37.80]You're different from us somehow.
[270:40.88]You mean because we haven't lost hope?
[270:43.02]Hope is a word I haven't heard in a long time.
[270:49.04]It does have a comforting ring to it, though.
[270:52.88]I don't know what kind of seed this is, but I'll do my best to grow it.
[271:00.46]What's that?
[271:00.94]This may just be the thing we needed.
[271:06.11]You're off to Protodome, then.
[271:07.33]You need to pass through Site 32.
[271:09.61]Take me with you.
[271:13.89]Take this with you.
[271:16.17]It's the key to a jet bike parked at the Site 32 ruins.
[271:19.93]I used to ride it when I was young.
[271:22.27]Hopefully it still works.
[271:25.89]They got even more powerful robots in that dome.
[271:29.04]They've overrun the place.
[271:31.18]Take care.
[271:33.26]Don't give up hope.
[271:34.04]You can reach the continent to the south through the sewers, but I wouldn't advise it.
[271:42.96]That's where Death Peak sits, the source of all this devastation.
[271:47.23]And besides, even someone as strong as you would never stand a chance against the mutants that live down there.
[271:52.31]I know.
[272:05.17]Edible seed tier list.
[272:07.23]Sunflower, S. Pumpkin seed, A. And that, my list is done.
[272:19.98]Poison sumac seed?
[272:21.38]Why are you eating poison?
[272:25.21]You're not eating poison sumac, are you?
[272:36.23]I could get down to the south from there.
[272:37.63]I feel like there's items and stuff there.
[272:40.11]Let me... Let's do this first because this is... This is a really fun part of the game and I'm really excited to do it.
[272:52.43]Here we go.
[273:15.38]Hold it right there.
[273:21.12]Oh.
[273:22.92]Bro.
[273:25.61]Thanks for the intro, boys.
[273:28.53]Bro.
[273:30.71]You lowlifes can call me Johnny.
[273:32.41]I'm the leader of this punk.
[273:35.25]Now listen up.
[273:36.79]The ruined highway up ahead is the only road you got.
[273:40.83]If you want to reach the other side, then you're going to have to ride in a race against me, that is.
[273:45.67]I'll let you use the jet bikes, because that's the kind of guy that I am.
[273:51.91]Don't sweat it, and don't you dare chicken out, babe.
[273:56.24]So what are you, you want to?
[273:59.04]You shiny axles know how to ride?
[274:09.53]Alright, here we go.
[274:12.33]It's now Mario Kart.
[274:13.52]I think, yeah, I got a boost.
[274:27.41]I can do a boost in a second here.
[274:35.26]Just wait until the very end and use the boost.
[274:37.26]That's the technique.
[274:39.14]Such a shit technique, but it's going to work every time.
[274:46.78]And... I just knocked him over.
[274:48.66]Did I win?
[274:49.72]I won.
[274:58.90]I did it.
[275:03.33]I love the pixel art for Chrono.
[275:04.99]It's so funny.
[275:13.29]You beat me.
[275:13.87]I don't get it.
[275:16.14]Well, you can challenge me anytime.
[275:18.20]We'll ride the wind, babe.
[275:19.50]I don't get it.
[275:26.02]I want.
[275:26.30]I think you can do a high score.
[275:32.74]I'm curious.
[275:42.71]If you beat, okay, somebody correct me.
[275:44.35]Some of you lore, um, Chrono Trigger heads.
[275:49.26]If I beat him five times, do I get an item or something?
[276:04.23]I need a high score.
[276:11.55]I still... I don't think I beat him.
[276:15.74]I actually think he won.
[276:16.50]Okay, cool.
[276:34.14]Well, I have to ride back now.
[276:38.12]Whoa!
[276:40.12]Wait, you can just... you can walk across this?
[276:42.78]I don't think I've ever even done this before.
[276:45.53]10 wins and you get the bike?
[277:43.76]What a joke.
[277:44.36]That's the best you can do.
[277:45.00]You can walk your way across.
[277:46.24]I already did it.
[277:50.61]Shit.
[277:52.21]Alright, I'm not gonna mess around anymore.
[277:54.49]I'm just gonna go.
[278:00.51]I need 1,500 points.
[278:06.10]I definitely gotta... Yeah.
[278:06.82]Yeah.
[278:32.60]You probably get it by bumping into him over and over again, I imagine.
[278:39.08]Where he bumps into your back.
[278:40.23]Alright, let's keep going.
[278:48.51]Mm-mm-mm-mm.
[279:03.09]I want to go down the sewers too.
[279:10.43]Derelict factory.
[279:12.72]How much longer will the stream be tonight?
[279:14.78]Um, like another hour or two.
[279:23.44]Jesus.
[279:33.04]Don't these guys only take damage from magic?
[279:40.27]Oh, okay.
[279:44.39]It's one of those.
[279:48.25]I think this is where we're going to do something cool.
[280:01.21]Hmm, not yet.
[280:02.45]I think we come back.
[280:04.17]Rotodome.
[280:18.76]Make this one quick.
[280:32.44]Still alive?
[280:33.10]Damn.
[280:33.48]Look at the log book from the walkable section.
[280:47.22]I'll bang a U-turn and go grab it.
[281:06.03]What's my Taco Bell order?
[281:07.09]That would be two cheesy gordita crunches and one Doritos Locos taco.
[281:13.16]Or one cheesy gordita crunch and two to three Doritos Locos tacos.
[281:23.53]And those are at S tier.
[281:25.03]It's the only thing at Taco Bell that's at S. Everything else is at C or lower.
[281:39.26]No nachos?
[281:41.30]No?
[281:42.38]I just do the... that's it?
[281:45.98]Mmm, actually the quesadilla is good there too.
[281:57.57]Cheese, quesadilla, and ketchup.
[281:59.49]It's good shit.
[282:10.59]Who's this?
[282:19.44]What's this thing?
[282:20.12]It's in bad shape, but it looks like a humanoid robot.
[282:24.83]Incredible.
[282:32.33]This is a top five song in the game, or at least top ten.
[282:38.06]But fix it?
[282:39.18]What if it attacks us like the other ones?
[282:40.74]Damn.
[282:41.22]Look, you really feel for them, don't you?
[282:44.26]Better get to work.
[283:07.26]The door won't budge.
[283:12.71]Robo's got an awesome sound effect too when he talks.
[283:15.23]It's that like... I'm going to give it some juice.
[283:19.86]Let's go.
[283:36.26]That manner of address would potentially cause offense.
[283:38.67]I am incapable of offensive speech.
[284:04.12]Well, some of us don't like it when people are so formal all the time.
[284:06.74]Isn't that right, Marl?
[284:09.79]Hehe.
[284:11.99]Understood, Luca.
[284:12.77]Alright, so what's your name?
[284:15.67]Name?
[284:19.78]Perhaps you're referring to my serial number.
[284:22.74]My serial number is R66Y.
[284:24.06]R66Y, cool.
[284:31.74]Cool.
[284:32.02]What are you talking about?
[284:32.68]That won't do at all.
[284:34.88]Come on, Chrono.
[284:35.46]Let's give him a better name.
[284:38.30]Robo.
[284:45.46]I named him Robbie.
[284:46.71]No.
[284:52.01]Name him Otto.
[284:54.93]No.
[284:55.11]The character's names are their names.
[285:02.74]That's perfect.
[285:04.42]Your new name is Robo, okay?
[285:07.67]My name is Robo.
[285:10.25]Data storage complete.
[285:13.09]Hey Robo, there's something I was hoping you could... Oh, there's Dora.
[285:17.88]What happened here?
[285:21.24]This dome contained many humans and others like me.
[285:27.51]Oh dear, this is kind of hard to say, but I think something awful happened while you were out.
[285:32.91]I don't think anyone else is left.
[285:38.66]I see.
[285:41.32]What about yourself?
[285:44.00]We came through a gate, a time warp from the year 1000.
[285:49.57]We learned there was a gate here when we went to Ariston.
[285:53.19]And then we found you when we came looking for the gate.
[285:55.03]But the door to the inner chamber is sealed shut, so it looks like we're out of luck.
[286:06.81]The dome's power has been shut off completely.
[286:08.70]The factory to the north contains an emergency power generator for this dome.
[286:14.82]I can bypass security and activate it.
[286:17.62]Shall we go there?
[286:20.70]You'd do that for us?
[286:22.72]Tomorrow I can stay.
[286:23.32]Who will stay behind?
[286:24.12]I'm going to say Luca, because I want the heal.
[286:26.62]I'll handle things here.
[286:53.48]New party member.
[286:55.66]Oh, doesn't... Brobo has heals too, doesn't he?
[287:00.82]Oh, laser spin is such a cool move.
[287:02.48]I love that move.
[287:03.18]It's great.
[287:10.67]Okay, I will... Let me go get this log.
[287:24.13]Robo's little pixel art is so cute, I love it.
[287:27.98]He's the coolest looking thing.
[287:36.88]Jesus.
[287:37.32]Don't worry, we're gonna laser spin.
[287:48.91]Oh, he doesn't have it.
[287:49.53]Is it a combo?
[288:04.80]Robo reminds me of a Furby.
[288:06.40]I can see it.
[288:34.09]Probably need to earn more TP.
[288:35.51]I've got experience with this, so it's cool.
[288:40.87]Aura Beam.
[288:41.87]There we go.
[289:04.43]Alright, where is this?
[289:06.27]There's like a book here, right?
[289:07.37]Okay, down there.
[289:17.05]Oh, shit.
[289:17.61]This is bad.
[289:18.07]I don't think I... Uh-oh.
[289:21.27]I don't think I can kill these.
[289:22.63]Does this count as magic?
[289:25.57]Oh, thank god.
[289:27.71]Does rocket punch count as magic?
[289:34.03]No.
[289:38.10]I'm so glad that Wind Slash is technically magic.
[289:41.06]Otherwise, I'm just dead.
[289:58.00]There it is.
[290:00.12]Supersonic Spin.
[290:02.93]alright race recorder what does that do remember his bike race score ah now you can I get it
[290:38.40]This game was so unnerving as a kid with all the doom, like the inevitable end of the world.
[290:42.78]Yeah, it was... I think this is probably the first time when I was younger that I really thought about, huh?
[290:50.63]Wait, so the world gets destroyed in 1999.
[290:53.73]That means there's nothing left.
[290:59.15]Well, that's awful.
[291:02.13]I feel like we should maybe not want that to happen.
[291:11.89]Y2K.
[291:12.15]Yeah, I was a teenager during Y2K.
[291:14.35]Everybody thought the whole world was going to end.
[291:23.82]Everybody made jokes about it.
[291:24.88]It was kind of like, oh, yeah, I mean, like, you know, could be.
[291:28.93]Nah, it's not going to happen.
[291:30.31]It's going to be fine.
[291:30.87]But do you remember, what was it the world was going to end?
[291:34.31]It was like the Mayan calendar, right?
[291:36.91]What was it?
[291:38.07]And it was like, I'll tell you, that day, that day in 2012, I remember sitting there.
[291:44.34]There was exact times that people were saying online and shit.
[291:48.34]And I'm like, I definitely felt a certain way.
[291:51.02]I was like, oh, fuck, what if it happens right now?
[291:53.44]Oh, it's like, it's like 1130 in the morning and that's when everybody said it was gonna happen.
[291:56.54]What if it happens?
[291:57.48]Oh, fuck.
[291:57.98]We're all dead.
[291:58.84]Oh, we're all gonna die.
[291:59.97]Okay.
[292:00.75]Oh.
[292:03.19]Weren't you like 20?
[292:03.97]Yeah, but I was way older than 20.
[292:14.92]I don't know.
[292:15.52]Like, everybody knew it wasn't gonna happen, but I still, it was just like, this is kind of fucking weird.
[292:19.98]What if it does?
[292:31.67]Can you please do your rendition of that strutting that ass guy?
[292:36.07]No, that just comes out randomly.
[292:38.09]I can't... I can't decide when that actually happens or not.
[292:41.67]Good move.
[292:59.91]I looked up exact time zones for the exact moment it was going to happen.
[293:03.03]Yeah, it was weird.
[293:06.51]It was genuinely creepy.
[293:07.72]It was genuinely... I don't know.
[293:10.26]I felt a certain way about it.
[293:31.17]What would you do if the world was gonna end in a week?
[293:33.15]And I knew?
[293:35.29]I would probably... I don't know.
[293:41.64]What can you even do in a week?
[293:44.54]That's the thing, right?
[293:53.83]I would probably just spend it with, you know, just be like, hey, who like of my friends and family, especially my family.
[294:01.47]Let's get together.
[294:09.45]Have like a let's do whatever we want.
[294:11.50]Let's have as much fun as possible.
[294:13.48]End of the world.
[294:14.08]I would definitely spend it with family for sure.
[294:26.48]Why are these guys so resistant to magic?
[294:43.64]What about Red Alert?
[294:53.83]You promised.
[294:56.94]um just I don't know I mean that requires four people I remember one of these being kind of tough especially when I was younger you have an end of the world stream but just pretend like it's gonna end
[295:22.47]Alright guys, yeah, of course, at 10 o'clock, the world ends at 10 o'clock tonight.
[295:28.71]It's an end of the world party.
[295:38.70]I should go in these.
[295:52.38]I don't know if I'd be innovating on anything like that.
[296:09.45]Remember this being a lot of battles.
[296:13.13]It's good because we want the experience anyways.
[296:26.41]Nice.
[296:28.64]He does a lot of damage.
[296:33.58]Do I have any extra... I kind of want him to get the glove.
[296:41.99]His defense is so insane already.
[297:09.34]If I know Jerma, he's not doing some whack shit.
[297:11.71]Wait, what?
[297:14.21]What do you mean?
[297:18.17]That's good too.
[297:23.34]That's not even for Robo.
[297:24.64]Who's that for?
[297:37.46]You don't think that's a whack thing to say?
[297:49.53]All systems down.
[297:50.55]Defense lasers deactivated.
[297:53.67]Great.
[297:54.87]Try to catch them all.
[298:07.28]I want to do Supersonic Beam.
[298:21.61]Wacky Wednesdays tomorrow?
[298:22.79]Alright, let's do Supersonic Spin.
[298:32.80]Three.
[298:47.70]tomorrow tomorrow's plan we're doing motortown start and then after a few hours of motortown we will continue our Chrono Trigger playthrough
[299:21.41]Why is the game so easy?
[299:24.68]I don't think it's a particularly difficult game.
[299:26.52]I also kind of know what to do in every scenario as well.
[299:36.81]If I remember, there are some things here later that get very challenging that I'm going to have to actually really pay attention to.
[299:51.03]I'm more so doing this because it's Nostalgia Thursdays.
[299:54.71]Nostalgia Tuesdays.
[299:56.85]That's for Luka.
[300:07.39]Optional endgame stuff is super hard.
[300:09.67]I remember the... Without spoilers, the kind of training guy.
[300:17.22]Having the multiple levels, multiple difficulties.
[300:19.36]I remember the last one was pretty hard.
[300:27.24]Specio, yeah.
[300:28.22]That's who I'm thinking of.
[300:36.52]Uh, I just wasn't looking at what you said.
[300:40.10]Zabby door lock system operational.
[300:42.08]Please enter passcode.
[300:43.94]Oh, fuck.
[300:44.26]What is the passcode?
[300:47.72]I don't know.
[300:48.08]I gotta get it.
[300:52.59]Oh, X-A-B-Y.
[300:53.61]That's right.
[300:54.11]Yeah.
[301:03.56]You probably get it here.
[301:04.66]Xavi.
[301:05.12]Okay, go back down.
[301:42.53]Any advice when something terrible happens?
[301:44.29]A cargo total today.
[301:45.35]That sucks.
[301:45.91]I'm sorry to hear that.
[301:48.41]I'll tell you.
[301:51.31]You just have to remember that.
[301:54.62]You have to hope that life is a gigantic set of scales.
[301:59.88]And when a lot of bad shit happens in a row.
[302:03.30]That hopefully means that some good things will happen in a row later.
[302:11.75]And... Hey, if you walked away from that... You walked away from that.
[302:19.22]I don't know how bad you're talking about, but hopefully not too, too bad.
[302:23.93]Uh, I'm gonna take probably my last break here.
[302:42.60]times right now yeah probably last break and then we'll finish up this get out of the uh this area I'll be right back I'll continue that thought will continue when I sit back down
[308:30.33]Yeah, we'll get to the end of this sequence and then probably call it there.
[308:36.29]What I was saying was... Yeah, life is kind of a bunch of... a balance of bad and good things.
[308:44.40]But unfortunately, in a lot of situations, you have to put your thumb on the scale.
[308:49.46]Which kind of sucks.
[308:51.64]But, it's the truth.
[308:58.58]Sometimes the life is very imbalanced.
[309:00.98]And you gotta do what you can to just put an extra weight on the good side.
[309:07.06]And it's fucking hard.
[309:09.36]Not on the bad side.
[309:10.28]Alright.
[309:21.19]Did I do it?
[309:25.67]Go Alexis from Operation, please enter passcode.
[309:31.12]How come I can't touch?
[309:32.10]I can't do it.
[309:33.79]Huh?
[309:34.27]I can fix him.
[309:35.27]No, instead I can make him worse.
[309:39.17]Okay, ding dong.
[309:59.13]OK, X, A, B, what the hell?
[310:11.11]Why is it?
[310:15.51]Are you sure I don't need to like have somebody tell it to me first?
[310:17.79]I think you actually have to find it.
[310:21.89]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[310:24.80]That made a sound.
[310:25.90]Why'd that make a sound?
[310:33.81]Huh?
[310:35.00]That's me pressing A, by the way.
[310:44.71]Okay.
[310:46.79]That was not X, A, B, Y. That was A, B, Y, X.
[310:56.20]Fucking Xbox, piece of fucking shit.
[310:59.86]Xbox fucking sucks, dude.
[311:02.46]Console's a fucking crock of shit.
[311:06.22]Alright, I gotta lock in.
[311:13.95]I think this is actually kind of an annoying boss.
[311:20.21]Emergency.
[311:20.71]The security system has gone haywire.
[311:22.53]We must escape immediately.
[311:28.17]Hurry before it's too late!
[311:44.28]Nice job, Robo.
[311:56.28]I can't use the elevator?
[311:57.24]Oh man.
[311:58.92]How lazy am I?
[312:09.80]Why did I touch this?
[312:16.76]Using the elevators in an emergency.
[312:18.40]Yeah, that's probably the worst thing I could do.
[312:38.40]These things are so annoying.
[312:49.52]Is there a quick way to kill these?
[312:52.54]Or is it just a pain in the ass?
[313:00.07]Oh, so what's this I hear about?
[313:01.39]They're talking about the 30th anniversary for this game or something.
[313:07.64]Those of you that are big fans of this series.
[313:13.90]It just passed.
[313:18.34]Yeah, they ain't releasing shit is what somebody said.
[313:27.92]For those of you that don't know.
[313:30.55]Chrono Trigger comes out and is... Everybody loves it.
[313:34.49]It's a great game.
[313:35.97]People say, oh my god, I can't... What an unbelievable game.
[313:39.59]The technology at the time and the storytelling at the time.
[313:42.97]It was really cool.
[313:46.46]They made Chrono Cross, which was kind of a massive flop.
[313:54.68]When I say kind of, I mean it was.
[314:02.33]They then decide they're going to make a game called Chrono Break.
[314:08.00]And then that game gets canceled.
[314:09.92]And the trademark actually runs out on it.
[314:14.99]Ten years later.
[314:20.27]Chrono canceled, yeah.
[314:26.12]Wait, these are my friends.
[314:30.08]R64Y, R67Y, R69Y.
[314:32.70]It is good to see you again.
[314:39.58]What are you doing?
[314:41.66]You are defective.
[314:43.46]You are not one of us.
[314:46.48]Pardon?
[314:46.84]I am malfunctioning?
[314:54.01]Affirmative.
[314:59.10]Crona, they're tearing him apart.
[315:27.71]They hate him because he is kind.
[315:31.82]Please stop, please.
[315:40.38]We're just kind of watching this.
[316:10.12]Robo, no!
[316:12.12]Nah, we shall eliminate the intruders.
[316:16.67]You cocky boxes of bolts if you're not getting away with this.
[316:24.46]Alright, let's do... Focus on the top left here.
[316:50.70]Heal.
[316:55.42]Massive payout if you throw.
[317:00.78]I don't... Anything could happen here.
[317:03.30]It's easy to lose in these games.
[317:07.59]I don't get a heal off or they string together a few.
[317:09.89]I know you got to pay attention.
[317:19.07]Oh no, they're dead.
[317:19.67]It would be insane to have bitten against what I was doing.
[317:36.36]It was 99% yes.
[317:38.56]So if I throw right here and you win, then you're going to owe me big time.
[318:12.73]Do I have any revives?
[318:13.63]Nah, we're good.
[318:20.02]Just wanted to make it a nail-biter for the people that are spending their points.
[318:34.94]Now we're good.
[318:46.57]That's it.
[318:47.67]That's a GG.
[318:48.33]Alright, but they threw him down the trash compactor.
[318:59.98]Let's see if he got stuck.
[319:03.70]I don't know.
[319:08.31]What do we do?
[319:08.81]He's in terrible shape.
[319:09.79]Alright, let's take him back to the Luca.
[319:30.44]Can you fix me?
[319:33.63]Shh, don't talk.
[319:36.83]You are trying to change the world.
[319:42.29]I don't know how far we'll get, but that's the plan.
[319:45.68]Anyway, Robo, what do you want to do after I finish repairing you?
[319:50.30]What do I want to do?
[319:52.50]Yeah, I mean, you were stuck here all this time.
[319:56.16]There must be a lot of things you want to do, right?
[320:00.99]No one has ever asked me that before, Luca.
[320:12.43]Good morning.
[320:14.61]Robo, thank goodness you're alright.
[320:17.18]Luca, you're incredible.
[320:19.74]Well, let's hope I never have to do that again.
[320:24.12]Luca, I have arrived at an answer to your question.
[320:27.16]I want to go with you.
[320:30.33]And let's go.
[320:30.73]The gate's right through there.
[320:32.19]Here we go.
[321:03.15]Wait, where are we now?
[321:07.63]Where are we?
[321:26.60]Ah, more drifters!
[321:30.76]Drifters, where are we?
[321:33.67]It is not a question of where, my friend, so much as when.
[321:38.66]This is the end of time.
[321:42.26]Travelers lost in time's flow turn up here much like driftwood on a beach.
[321:47.54]Might I ask where you are from?
[321:52.19]We're from 1000 A.D.
[321:54.87]I come from the year 2380.
[321:58.91]Which means it would be safest if one of us stayed here.
[322:25.00]Testicular torsion?
[322:28.44]Here alone?
[322:29.18]One of us must remain.
[322:31.10]Will it be, Crona?
[322:58.12]This is where it gets hot.
[323:07.14]I cannot leave Chrono.
[323:08.43]Chrono is a mandatory party member.
[323:10.59]For now.
[323:37.72]I think it's going to be these three for now.
[323:45.98]Pull.
[323:46.22]We need to pull.
[323:48.40]Let's wait for a pull when I get some more permanent party members.
[323:55.39]Although this might be a mistake because Luka is very good.
[324:01.01]But just the constant heals.
[324:03.65]They're just so much.
[324:04.89]They can heal so much.
[324:09.50]okay well that is the way of things if you decide to switch party members you can do so via the main menu whenever you wish I love when old games used to do this we're in the end of time this is this really weird place it's really like kind of oh what is this remember go into the main menu and press the x button if you wish to switch members
[324:33.43]How do we get back to our own time?
[324:36.83]Once you've been through a gate, you can use it to return here whenever you wish.
[324:44.03]Step back in the light and press A. Once more, press A. But beware the gate connected to that bucket.
[324:50.76]Okay.
[324:59.25]For all the people that said that the game is a little too easy,
[325:04.83]Let's go ahead and do a couple things here.
[325:13.21]Let's use the bucket.
[325:15.41]Hey.
[325:20.80]You needn't be in such a rush.
[325:23.02]Before you have... Go look at that door.
[325:32.34]What are you looking at?
[325:33.72]Me?
[325:33.94]I'm Spekiel, the master of war.
[325:36.10]I watch all kinds of battles from here.
[325:39.30]How do I look?
[325:42.05]You look pretty weak.
[325:44.07]Oh, I see.
[325:44.65]Well, how I look depends on how strong you are.
[325:47.69]If you're strong, I look strong.
[325:49.05]If you're weak, well, I look weak.
[325:53.15]Hmm?
[325:54.74]Oh, you've got it in you, don't you?
[325:56.02]That must be why the old guy let you through.
[325:59.03]A long, long time before you were born, there was a kingdom where magic flourished.
[326:03.23]Everyone there could use it.
[326:06.27]But the people abused their powers and ended up destroying the place.
[326:09.00]And after that, there wasn't much anyone left who could use magic.
[326:11.64]Well, except a fiends, of course.
[326:15.10]But you have it here.
[326:15.92]You have that inner strength, I mean.
[326:17.78]Magic needs power of the heart, and that's where it flows from.
[326:21.91]There's four types of magic.
[326:22.97]Fire, water, light, and shadow.
[326:25.27]Not everyone's got the same type.
[326:28.25]You with the punk hairdo, you've got light.
[326:31.91]Hey, the gal with the ponytail has the power of water.
[326:35.25]Hey, what's with this big clunky thing?
[326:36.95]Sorry, buddy.
[326:38.15]You aren't alive.
[326:39.97]You've got great inner strength, for what it's worth.
[326:41.77]It's just you're descended from any ancient magic users.
[326:45.42]I don't have any idea.
[326:46.50]You can't cast any spells.
[326:47.46]I don't know.
[326:48.91]Your laser weapons and whatnot should suffice so they can inflict shadow damage.
[326:53.21]Kind of like shadow magic.
[326:56.91]By the way, it's not just magic.
[326:58.47]Everything is made up of those four elements.
[327:02.04]Alright, starting from the door, circle clockwise along the walls of my room three times and say, I want to use magic over and over in your head.
[327:08.92]Don't lose track now.
[327:09.76]Three times.
[327:10.30]Don't want you turning yourselves into butter.
[327:14.90]I want to use magic.
[327:17.61]I want to use magic.
[327:18.51]I want to use magic.
[327:19.45]I want to use magic.
[327:20.90]Did I do it?
[327:22.80]What?
[327:59.16]Teach me this shit.
[328:00.02]What the fuck?
[328:06.40]Okay.
[328:07.18]Well done.
[328:08.95]Ipso facto minimo magico.
[328:15.31]Chrono, learn to use magic.
[328:18.81]Oh, yeah.
[328:22.01]Marl, learn to use magic.
[328:26.48]Robo cannot learn magic.
[328:29.63]so all four to five with magic and would you like to try it out alright let's go alright gotta win she's dead
[328:58.49]my god 150. uh I don't think I can beat him yet maybe I can see if I can still do it no way I'm dead
[329:31.10]And Gigi came over.
[329:34.92]Yeah, I win.
[329:37.30]Are you making any new friends you're bringing to see me, you hear?
[329:39.86]I like you guys.
[329:42.72]And also, if you happen to have any slugs, if you happen to see some of the slug.
[329:48.97]Hey.
[329:58.45]Well, well, it seems I was right.
[330:00.33]People who lived long ago all enjoyed such powers, you know.
[330:04.19]Yes, long, long ago.
[330:05.35]Well, I know you must be eager to finish this thing you seem so intent on doing.
[330:09.63]But why not first pay a visit to your own era?
[330:13.26]Haste makes waste, as they say.
[330:14.50]And you'll find that even truer here.
[330:17.84]Come and see me whenever you have the need.
[330:19.98]Think of me as your guide on time's road.
[330:30.45]What's this bucket do?
[330:33.17]I know what it does, but you don't.
[330:34.45]Go to the Day of Lavos.
[331:04.07]Chrono Trigger is one of the games that did something very interesting.
[331:10.53]And not very many other games did this at the time.
[331:13.87]This is the end of the game.
[331:15.75]This is the actual end of the game.
[331:18.26]And it can be ended here.
[331:23.62]This is truly the last boss of the game.
[331:33.52]1999 AD.
[331:34.10]Date confirmed.
[331:34.82]The time is 1.24.
[331:35.76]This is the precise moment.
[331:45.63]Well, it can't actually because you can't beat Lavos at this level.
[331:49.83]Well... But... You could.
[331:54.67]If you just leveled up a shitload... And just... You could probably do it.
[332:02.29]That's...
[332:05.28]There it is Corona, what do we do?
[332:11.28]Let's go!
[332:13.38]Hey, hype's in the chat
[332:42.61]I'm gonna die in one hit.
[332:59.51]Ice is pretty good, isn't it?
[333:04.93]I remember this is a long fight, too.
[333:08.61]You gotta kind of... You gotta last a while.
[333:14.18]And there might be some more that you don't know.
[333:16.82]And that's fine.
[333:21.69]No, dude, I'm fine.
[333:22.83]We're good.
[333:23.27]I'm gonna beat the game right now.
[333:55.67]Kill it!
[333:59.91]Oh, it's because he's using the strength of the dragon tank, that's right.
[334:07.77]He's gonna pull out something crazy here.
[334:09.35]Not if I kill him before he does that.
[334:12.67]1 to 26 odds.
[334:37.85]Come on, come on!
[334:42.19]It actually would be kind of cool if I get to do... I've never... I've always been too scared to do this.
[335:08.66]What a cool final boss.
[335:11.87]Yeah, just wait, just wait.
[335:15.35]Yeah, it is really cool.
[335:17.29]But just wait.
[335:25.68]Supersonic spin, let's go.
[335:31.86]It can be done, it just takes a while.
[335:49.40]How much HP does Lavos have?
[335:50.56]Like 5,000? 10,000?
[336:02.89]10,000 in 1999, 30,000 in... oh damn.
[336:36.79]Uh oh.
[336:54.00]I'm doing it.
[336:54.92]I'm going for it.
[336:55.98]I'm going to try.
[337:08.27]This is not going to work anymore.
[337:23.17]Although I think it's still alright.
[337:28.00]It is technically a boss rush.
[337:44.96]Six damage?
[337:46.02]Oh, that's bad.
[338:02.45]Okay, no longer counterattack.
[338:31.16]72.
[338:31.22]I mean, it's got... I'm kind of dead.
[338:43.77]We're through... That's boss 3 out of, like, 15 or, like, 20.
[338:46.99]Okay.
[339:01.02]He has one HP.
[339:05.89]See if I can get another cycle though.
[339:38.36]nope see you later and this part always scared the shit out of me when I was younger when you die in Chrono Trigger oh you'll see
[340:16.20]yeah this this means the world ends yeah it does truth direct impact on on truth calm yourself give me a full status update every continent on Earth is being destroyed by fucking bombs or whatever they are
[340:41.13]poor Taurus Medina they've all been destroyed no director we've got incoming evacuate to the shelter dome director sir you have to come with us there's enough time get moving yes sir Lavos
[341:14.08]in the end the future refused to change and it just screams at you
[341:53.00]Hey.
[341:54.98]But there's still time to fix it.
[341:59.24]Imagine seeing that at 10.
[342:06.41]That's definitely one of those full gulp moments when you're 11.
[342:13.97]Oh, let's watch this, actually.
[342:15.11]This is the Toriyama cutscene.
[342:19.39]Might be a little spoilery, but just know that.
[342:31.29]We've already seen a third of it already, so... But there is shit in here that you're not going to want to see if you have never seen this game before.
[342:38.01]And it's pretty good.
[342:45.65]The coolest part about this game is that you can... Well, you'll see.
[343:03.60]I feel like I've said that a few times tonight.
[343:07.94]Robo Smash!
[344:05.99]Holy shit.
[344:07.07]Goosebumps.
[344:14.89]I love that part.
[344:47.85]That's the epoch.
[344:52.37]There are other cutscenes in the game.
[344:53.83]I'm surprised we haven't seen any yet.
[344:57.95]I think the second half of the game, the tail end is a lot of them.
[345:10.78]That's a perfect place to stop for today though.
[345:21.05]That has been the first part of Chrono Trigger.
[345:27.63]I would imagine there'll be probably three or four parts of this.
[345:30.79]Maybe more.
[345:31.61]This is a lovely little game.
[345:44.41]And we've only seen... You know what?
[345:47.18]Let's not get spoiled.
[345:54.64]There is extra content.
[345:55.82]I'll try to do it.
[345:56.64]I don't really know where it is though.
[345:58.84]You guys can help me though.
[345:59.61]Those of you that played it before.
[346:00.55]We'll do part two tomorrow.
[346:06.05]I'll start with that.
[346:08.27]I want to play that Motor Town game.
[346:09.92]I feel like that'd be fun for a couple hours.
[346:13.68]And then transition to this to do some more like chill late night streaming.
[346:27.69]Yeah, we'll start at the same time, probably around like 4 or 5.
[346:30.65]5 p.m.
[346:31.03]seems like a good start to get into the nighttime.
[346:38.62]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[346:41.00]5 o'clock.
[346:43.26]Be there or don't.
[346:44.08]It's up to you.
[346:50.98]I want to see real quick, though, extras.
[346:56.46]Ah, you have to beat the game to unlock all this stuff.
[346:58.50]Okay.
[347:03.52]There are multiple endings.
[347:06.54]So, you know.
[347:09.85]I think there's multiple ways to get to the end.
[347:11.61]I don't know if there's multiple actual endings or not.
[347:25.13]That's going to be it for tonight.
[347:36.40]And I will see you guys very soon.
[347:38.70]We already saw the one ending.
[347:43.39]Yeah.
[347:50.21]Arc one complete.
[347:51.27]I wonder how much is actually.
[347:54.88]Because we're still missing quite a few characters, so... I think we're really only about 20% through the game.
[348:14.89]I need to hear the credit song.
[348:16.85]Oh, sorry about that.
[348:26.78]That was fun.
[348:29.10]Yeah, I figured it was going to be just hanging out and playing it.
[348:31.98]I just thought, you know what?
[348:32.66]I've talked about this game for so long.
[348:34.98]I've spent half a decade telling you guys that I like that game.
[348:40.52]And that, oh, maybe one day, maybe one day.
[348:42.16]I just said, you know what?
[348:43.14]Fuck it.
[348:43.46]I'm just doing it.
[348:53.07]On an 18 and a half hour playthrough, you're about three hours in.
[348:55.62]Yeah, that makes sense then.
[349:02.26]I'm going to say it's going to take five streams.
[349:05.94]That are all four to five hours long.
[349:09.43]To get through it.
[349:22.94]Another reason why I wanted to do it is because it's a really easy game to just kind of play, to just go to.
[349:31.31]So if I start with something that's, oh, I'm going to do this today for a few hours, we can just go to this after that until it's done.
[349:49.22]It's easy in terms of JRPGs.
[349:50.56]There's no grinding.
[349:52.50]No, not that I remember.
[349:53.36]I don't think there is very much grinding at all.
[349:57.38]If any, really, honestly.
[349:58.48]Alright guys, see you tomorrow.
[350:05.38]Have a good rest of your night.
[350:07.22]Good night, good morning, good afternoon, wherever you are.
[350:09.80]See you guys soon.
[351:00.15]I just have to... This is a funny comment.
[351:02.51]Somebody said, ban anybody under 30 for these Super Nintendo streams.
[351:16.61]How would you even do that?
[351:18.47]That's so stupid.
[351:22.36]No, don't you understand?
[351:24.34]We want the zoomers to consume this content.
[351:29.22]We don't want to gatekeep this content.
[351:30.62]We want them to consume it.
[351:38.31]ID check at the door.
[351:50.25]Just saw that pop up.
[351:51.17]I was like, it made me giggle for a second.
[351:53.35]Alright.
[351:54.53]See you guys later.
[352:22.04]I'm going to chime in one more time.
[352:24.82]This game has been re-released so many times that it's possible that you also, if you're a Zoomer, you've probably played it.
[352:30.75]It's like Skyrim.
[352:34.33]This has been re-released like eight times over the last 25 years.
[352:37.79]Alright.
[352:41.68]Now I'll see you tomorrow.
