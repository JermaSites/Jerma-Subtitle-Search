[00:01.54]Okay, so I had to... Something's wrong with my ethernet ports.
[00:05.20]But, alright, we're good.
[00:10.55]We're here.
[00:15.45]Okay, let me ask you a question.
[00:17.49]Do you... Alright, do you think... And by the way, I'm not even late.
[00:20.35]I'm not even late.
[00:20.83]It's supposed to be between 10 and 11 AM, and I was early.
[00:23.59]Good thing I was fucking early, huh?
[00:26.58]Because the stream was supposed to start between 10 and 11.
[00:29.58]Oh boy, good thing I turned it on at like 9.40.
[00:31.32]Not happy.
[00:38.18]Not happy.
[00:38.68]Alright.
[00:42.37]Technically not late.
[00:43.87]Yeah, we're going to play this game.
[00:46.37]In the process, I was getting ready.
[00:48.93]I've wanted to play this since it kind of came out.
[00:52.71]All guys back up.
[00:53.57]I'm not playing it.
[00:54.27]No.
[00:54.53]No.
[00:55.96]No, I'm over it.
[00:57.41]I'm over it.
[00:57.81]We're playing Barn Finders.
[01:04.45]I'm over it.
[01:05.09]I'm playing Barn Finders instead.
[01:12.09]And plus, I have the Twitter open.
[01:14.05]I can see that the servers are still down.
[01:16.81]No.
[01:20.89]I'm back.
[01:28.14]Let's see.
[01:29.38]I'm going to check to see if the... Good thing I started fucking early.
[01:34.14]Good thing the stream started like 30 minutes early.
[01:42.81]What does it say?
[01:44.38]We're aware of issues affecting matchmaking right now.
[01:46.56]We're working on a fix.
[01:47.36]It's not ready.
[01:47.98]We're going to play Barnfinders until it is.
[01:57.38]I don't even need to do an intro.
[01:58.48]I don't want... Let's go.
[01:59.46]We're going to play Barn Finders.
[02:03.06]Are you ready?
[02:05.40]No, Drew?
[02:05.92]No, I couldn't do it.
[02:06.60]I was going to... Oh, I couldn't do it.
[02:08.76]I was about to open it.
[02:09.70]I double clicked it.
[02:10.46]And I was like, I don't want to fucking play this game.
[02:11.90]I don't want to do this.
[02:14.92]Who do I want to be?
[02:16.44]I promise this game is going to be interesting.
[02:17.86]You're going to love this one.
[02:18.80]I promise.
[02:19.22]Okay, let me... See if this works.
[02:28.41]Hello?
[02:29.95]Okay.

[05:08.29]This is... It's auctions and buying and stuff.
[05:11.53]You have to find like hidden treasures in... What's the name of that game where they yell at each other and they buy storage units?
[05:18.77]And like they go through like old dirty diapers and somebody finds an old ring that's worth like $60.

[09:31.95]A naughty stag for a friend.
[09:34.35]Hello, barn finders.
[09:35.23]Can you help an old friend?
[09:36.85]So, I heard there's still a naughty stag at the old red barn.
[09:40.21]Maybe you could find it there for you.
[09:42.29]There's money in it if you do.
[09:45.42]Find the old stag at the red barn.
[09:47.92]Alright, let's go to barn hub.
[09:54.14]Travel by... Wait, you drive cars in this game?
[09:56.30]It's automatic plus one letter grade.
[09:59.00]We need to go to the red barn.
[10:01.59]Oh, I only have 30 bucks.
[10:06.27]Travel to Red Barn.
[10:09.47]Can I pick up the brick?
[10:13.11]I can't pick up a fucking brick.
[10:14.16]Are you kidding me?
[10:15.24]I would have given this game a full letter grade.
[10:16.68]Alright, let's go.
[10:19.34]So how do I get there?
[10:20.08]Michelle, wait.
[10:23.24]Open your shop?
[10:27.38]Spam emails are cool.
[10:28.52]Check them out.
[10:28.90]Alright, how do I drive the car?
[10:37.27]How did you get over here?
[10:38.03]What?
[10:41.97]How did he get over there?
[10:42.65]Alright, store items.
[10:46.39]Store quest items.
[10:47.31]Alright, I gotta go to Red Barn.
[10:48.69]Do I have a map?
[10:51.76]How am I supposed to find Red Barn?
[10:55.64]Is this the only Red Barn in town?
[10:57.58]I have to go to the computer?
[11:04.67]I didn't have enough money.
[11:11.33]Item cap.
[11:12.35]Barn hub.
[11:14.33]Red barn.
[11:15.27]Travel.
[11:15.95]One gas.
[11:16.71]How do I get gas?
[11:22.53]Can I buy gas?
[11:28.01]Gas, gas, gas, gas.
[11:30.23]Auto parts?
[11:30.85]This looks incredibly elaborate.
[11:38.10]Gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas.
[11:41.55]Call mom.
[11:43.57]Where do you get gas?
[11:47.59]Antiques.
[11:51.53]Play Death Ray.
[11:53.57]TV.
[11:55.98]Buy gas on the computer.
[11:57.66]No you don't.
[11:59.62]Where's the gas?
[12:02.34]Gas is on the map?
[12:09.39]Yeah, I don't have any gas.
[12:11.55]This is probably a stray gas can.
[12:15.05]Is this it?
[12:24.82]I just need a can of gas.
[12:28.86]Recycle all your trash and buy gas.
[12:30.68]Wait a minute.
[12:32.04]Ah, look at that.
[12:34.25]I got one gas.
[12:37.19]Nice.
[12:37.65]Okay, cool.
[12:38.39]Now we can go.
[12:44.33]Alright, I'm ready.
[12:51.70]Remove motion blur?
[12:52.78]It shouldn't be on.
[12:53.46]I don't think there's an option to remove it.
[13:00.86]Resolution, full screen.
[13:02.22]Yeah, texture quality, GPU memory, 700 million, whatever it is.
[13:06.70]Oh, motion blur.
[13:07.50]Okay, grain.
[13:08.28]Get that off too.
[13:12.19]Everything else is okay.
[13:15.49]Alright, let's go.
[13:19.97]Alright, red barn.
[13:20.97]We got one gas.
[13:24.17]It's just a cutscene to drive the car.
[13:25.55]That's hard.
[13:31.30]You gotta give me control of the car.
[13:37.96]Use resources to fix broken items.
[13:41.50]Turn off V-Sync?
[13:53.74]You would die on the way to the red barn if they let you drive.
[13:56.64]Okay.
[13:58.62]Maybe.
[14:01.68]Alright, tutorial.
[14:02.98]As a barn finder, your job is to find requested items.
[14:05.57]Look for other valuable items you can sell them in your shop.
[14:08.13]Search for additional items and secrets.
[14:12.37]Alright, let's find a secret.
[14:13.39]Definitely one right here.
[14:18.47]Wait, it's probably stuff under things, right?
[14:23.00]Crash!
[14:25.46]Oh, that famous red barn.
[14:26.50]Let's explore.
[14:27.18]Oh.
[14:30.48]Open it up.
[14:30.86]Do I have a flashlight?
[14:33.96]Cigarettes!
[14:34.40]That's worth at least ten bucks.
[14:39.86]Wow, I actually kind of like this game.
[14:44.10]You just make money by recycling stuff and clean up a house.
[14:51.73]Look at chat.
[14:52.27]You're blind.
[14:53.03]What, what, what, what, what?
[15:03.01]Sorry for interrupting your plans, Jerma.
[15:05.03]Oh, now I feel like a dick.
[15:15.57]I feel like an asshole now.
[15:25.49]Oh, no, no.
[15:27.75]Was I like a whiny streamer?
[15:29.65]Shit.
[15:32.57]No, I wasn't.
[15:33.23]No, I wasn't.
[15:33.87]You didn't hear it.
[15:34.41]I was off camera when I was gone.
[15:36.69]That's a fake account?
[15:38.91]That's not even a real account.
[15:42.63]What?
[15:46.55]No, I wasn't on camera.
[15:48.31]No, you didn't hear anything.
[15:50.78]Oh, this is worth $70!
[15:51.68]Ooh, $70!
[15:51.86]Roll to zoom in and zoom out.
[16:03.76]Alright, let's mark that for transport.
[16:06.38]Wait, study it.
[16:09.16]Why do I study it?
[16:09.86]Transport it.
[16:10.45]Press T to transport.
[16:11.81]Transport it.
[16:13.09]Pick up in 3... 2...
[16:18.18]Oh, okay.
[16:18.62]He just takes it.
[16:21.16]Can I transport this stuff?
[16:30.50]I'm debated by people.
[16:31.98]No, it's real.
[16:32.92]I don't have a key.
[16:41.14]Wait, it is...
[17:05.11]Let's go, let's go, let's go, right?
[17:13.15]Let's go.
[17:13.51]Let's back up.
[17:24.88]Is it working?
[17:25.36]Herman, no.
[17:31.47]Don't, no.
[17:32.19]Don't do that.
[17:42.53]No, it's for real.
[17:43.35]It has to be.
[17:45.59]Looking for a game to capture.
[17:47.36]Okay, here we go.
[17:53.00]Was it right?
[17:53.82]I'm just going.
[17:54.58]I'm going.
[17:54.86]Let's go.
[17:55.24]Let's go.
[17:55.53]This is it.
[17:55.87]Let's go.
[17:56.21]Let's go.
[17:56.55]It's real.
[17:56.95]It's real.
[17:57.23]It's real.
[17:57.55]It's real.
[17:57.85]It's real.
[18:35.52]What happened?
[18:38.34]That is real though, isn't it?
[18:39.58]It's not a... You're so gullible.
[18:46.22]Wait, hold on.
[18:57.17]Hold on a minute.
[18:58.39]You fucking really just got me with this shit?
[19:02.65]This person didn't tweet that.
[19:06.97]You linked me to fake, a fake account.
[19:10.67]Of this person.
[19:12.21]That's supposed to be, like, that, that's not, that's not okay.
[19:21.40]I was so ready.
[19:23.74]I was like, this is the real, okay, and I, oh my god.
[19:27.26]And you even did, like, the little, oh, like, hey, at GermanNA5, sorry about that, like, hoot.
[19:32.83]Oh, come on, man.
[19:33.79]That's just my ego getting in the way.
[19:39.26]Like, oh, the Fall Guys guy, like, hit me up.
[19:41.04]He must have seen my stream was one of the top streams for Fall Guys.
[19:44.92]He must have came in and said, hey, man.
[19:59.07]What the fuck?
[20:00.87]Alright, we're playing AI.
[20:02.17]I just, I was in the middle of doing that.
[20:04.77]I was in the middle of doing something else.
[20:08.19]This is a fake person.
[20:09.53]Wait, is it?
[20:11.15]No, it's a real person.
[20:13.73]How did you even do, wait, Fall Guys Owl.
[20:17.80]What's the real person's name?
[20:21.76]You, you, this is, that's not alright.
[20:26.26]I'm playing AI Dungeon.
[20:28.93]God dammit, why did I- I got absolutely- I got absolutely baited there.
[20:34.53]That's the worst one in a long time.
[20:37.49]I was in the middle of playing something else.
[20:40.03]Oh boy, oh boy.
[20:41.73]Okay, here we go.
[20:42.77]AI dungeon is what we're doing for now.
[20:44.34]I- what am I- I fucked it all up.
[20:50.50]Send me like-
[20:52.57]Alright, like, you may as well say that, like, if I send you two Bitcoin, you'll send me four.
[20:58.31]Like, seriously, like, I just, I thought that was real.
[21:00.43]I clicked on it.
[21:01.07]I'm like, oh, this is real.
[21:02.47]I trusted.
[21:11.27]I'm ready.
[21:14.87]I prepared myself for this shit.
[21:30.52]Alright, what we got?
[21:42.99]What should I pick?
[21:43.61]This is not even a real person.
[21:46.68]Stop tweeting at me, this guy.
[21:48.66]This is a fake account.
[21:49.66]He's probably gonna get his account removed.
[21:56.11]Yeah, LOL, sorry.
[21:57.43]Alright, well, have fun with, like, your account.
[22:00.05]What do you want me to know?
[22:02.71]He apologized.
[22:03.43]It's a real account.
[22:04.07]It's not a real account!
[22:08.66]I can't fucking believe it.
[22:09.98]I cannot believe it.
[22:10.88]I am so... Words cannot even describe how just upset I am right now.
[22:17.18]I can't even tell you.
[22:20.99]I didn't even save that last game, too.
[22:22.85]And now I'm going to be so turned off on that one.
[22:25.29]Alright, let's do fantasy.
[22:26.92]Select a character.
[22:30.70]What's it going to do?
[22:31.24]What's it going to get warmed up?
[22:37.38]I can't.

[23:02.65]Alright, here we go.
[23:04.27]Didn't you guys say that- Is it text-to-speech?
[23:23.35]Only for premium, oh.
[23:25.91]You are Garfield, a wizard living in the kingdom of Larian.
[23:30.34]You have a staff and a spell book.
[23:32.62]You finish your long journey and finally arrive at the ruin you've been looking for.
[23:37.70]You've come here searching for a mystical spell book of great power called the Book of Essence.
[23:42.95]You look around and see nothing.
[23:44.41]Yet something tells you the book is close by.
[23:46.45]You look down and notice a small rat.
[23:50.58]Suddenly the rat changes into a human and starts laughing at you.
[23:56.46]Do.
[23:57.84]Why does it say do?
[24:10.01]Why are you laughing?
[24:13.26]Why is the rat laughing?
[24:14.78]Why are they laughing?
[24:22.93]Why are you laughing?
[24:25.90]Right, do I need to put it in quotes?
[24:29.88]Don't ask questions.
[24:31.50]Ask why are you laughing, right?
[24:34.97]Say why are you laughing, right?
[24:38.69]Do I need that in quotes?
[24:46.92]Oh, you can't see.
[24:56.36]You.

[25:02.04]Okay, so that works, right?
[25:08.85]You say, why are you laughing?
[25:10.87]The man suddenly turns around and blasts you with a bolt of pure energy.
[25:14.91]You fall to the ground in pain and see the book on the other side of the room.
[25:21.08]Okay.
[25:22.42]You.
[25:23.20]What do you do?
[25:25.74]Grab at my pearls.
[25:28.31]I don't know why.
[25:31.69]I don't know what that means.
[25:34.37]You grab at your pearls.
[25:36.29]You can't find your pearl necklace.
[25:38.35]Then you feel something sharp prick your finger.
[25:40.81]It's your necklace!
[25:41.85]And the pearls are back to normal.
[25:47.16]They must have been deleted from it.
[25:50.24]How much is pearls?
[25:58.06]Okay.
[26:00.54]Attack.
[26:02.15]Attack the rat.
[26:04.63]Attack the rat man.
[26:10.11]You attack the rat man.
[26:11.15]You grab a rock from the ground and hurl it at the man.
[26:13.64]The rock flies straight at the man who is too stunned to move out of the way.
[26:19.84]Throw another rock at his head.
[26:29.14]You throw another rock at his head.
[26:31.28]The man turns around just in time to avoid the rock.
[26:34.20]He sees another rock on the ground and picks it up, preparing to throw it.
[26:38.56]You grab another rock and throw it at the man.
[26:42.27]Dodge the rock.
[26:47.73]This guy has spells.
[26:48.65]Why does he need to do this shit?
[26:50.97]Dodge the rock.
[26:56.51]You dodge the rock.
[26:57.65]The rock lands next to the rat man.
[26:59.93]Suddenly, the rat man leaps at you and bites your throat.
[27:03.87]You fall to the ground, gasping for air.
[27:08.36]Grab rock and smash his head.
[27:17.82]You grab a rock and smash his head.
[27:20.43]You grab a rock and hurl it at the rat man.
[27:22.21]The rock lands on his head again.
[27:29.51]Okay, wasn't he on top of me?
[27:32.03]You grab a rock and hurl at the man.
[27:33.39]The rock lands on his head, killing him.
[27:35.73]Your head starts to throb.
[27:37.77]Suddenly, you fall down on the ground and fall unconscious.
[27:41.37]Say, is there anyone out here who can help me?
[27:53.44]You threw it in the air and it fell back on his head.
[28:02.91]You say, is there anyone out here who can help me?
[28:05.43]Your mouth tastes horrible.
[28:06.78]Your mouth tastes horrible.
[28:10.48]You're lying on the ground.
[28:11.40]You look up and see a human standing above you.
[28:13.20]He grabs your hand.
[28:15.96]Say, thank you.
[28:18.98]No, uh... I'm in bad shape.
[28:25.07]I'm in bad shape.
[28:30.81]Slap his hand away?
[28:33.14]I'm in bad shape.
[28:34.34]Don't worry.
[28:35.12]We'll get you help.
[28:36.56]Suddenly, you feel the worst pain of your life in your stomach.
[28:39.90]You fall on the ground and start to lose consciousness.
[28:44.78]Say, I ate raw eggs earlier.
[28:53.84]Can you bring me to someone who can help?
[29:04.72]You're having organ failure?
[29:09.38]I ate raw eggs earlier.
[29:11.15]Can you bring me to someone who can help me?
[29:13.55]He starts dragging you on the ground towards the nearest village.
[29:17.15]You look up at him and see that his eyes are completely black.
[29:20.57]The man is not a man.
[29:21.57]He is a monster.
[29:32.34]What kind of monster are you?
[29:37.77]I'm a man.
[29:39.05]What kind of monster are you?
[29:41.51]You continue to get dragged on the ground.
[29:43.17]Suddenly, you fall asleep.
[29:45.93]Your eyes flutter open and you see the sun.
[29:50.94]Wait, so I just completely, totally misjudged this guy?
[29:56.90]Am I hallucinating?
[29:58.06]What's going on here?
[29:58.88]Alright.
[30:00.50]You flutter your eyes open and you see the sun.
[30:02.38]Okay.
[30:04.46]Stare into the sun.
[30:12.43]You stare into the sun.
[30:14.15]You suddenly feel much better.
[30:16.23]You are in so much pain.
[30:17.55]You just want to lay down and die.
[30:19.45]You look up at the sky and see a beautiful girl in a red dress.
[30:25.44]Stare at sun until it hurts.
[30:29.70]No, until... Stare at sun and continue staring directly into sun.
[30:41.74]Did I spell that right?
[30:49.00]You continue staring directly into the sun.
[30:51.24]The beautiful girl reaches her hand.
[30:53.38]Suddenly you feel a blast of heat on your face.
[30:55.84]You scream in pain.
[31:00.17]Wait, is this from looking at the sun?
[31:04.81]You start screaming in pain and fall to the ground.
[31:07.19]How many times?
[31:07.71]I'm just on the ground.
[31:09.29]Alright, get up.
[31:14.52]You look around and see the man dragging you.
[31:16.25]You ask him what he is doing, but he just ignores you.
[31:18.31]You feel like you're going to die.
[31:22.07]What do you do?
[31:22.55]I stand up.
[31:31.90]You stand up.
[31:33.16]The man continues dragging you towards the village.
[31:35.23]Suddenly you notice a hole in your stomach.
[31:41.36]You fall down and pass out.
[31:44.04]Your face becomes increasingly numb as you lose consciousness.
[31:53.95]Do you have any water?
[31:56.57]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[31:59.33]Excuse me.
[31:59.69]Do you have any Gatorade?
[32:00.55]How do you spell Gatorade?
[32:08.92]Like that, right?
[32:16.64]Do you have any Gatorade?
[32:18.88]He stops dragging you and looks at you.
[32:20.96]I don't have time for your foolishness.
[32:26.01]Say, do you have any water?
[32:37.50]How about Powerade?
[32:40.00]He walks over to a nearby tap and takes a drink from it.
[32:43.52]Can I have some water?
[32:45.90]He pauses and thinks for a moment.
[32:48.41]I'll ask my wife if she has any.
[32:52.09]Where is your wife?
[32:59.55]Oh shit.
[33:04.97]Oh no.
[33:05.89]Where is your wife?
[33:08.07]He starts dragging you again.
[33:09.45]Suddenly you feel a sharp pain in your back.
[33:11.16]You continue screaming as the man drags you into the village.
[33:13.52]I'm getting my fucking ass kicked.
[33:19.52]Give me water.
[33:23.28]Scum.
[33:29.63]You say, give me water, scum.
[33:31.69]He looks over his shoulder at you.
[33:33.59]Shut up, or I'll give you something to really scream about.
[33:37.13]He continues dragging you.
[33:39.20]You finally reach the edge of the village.
[33:47.94]Hmm.
[33:49.12]What do you do?
[33:53.86]Cry.
[33:55.39]Start crying.
[34:03.81]You start crying.
[34:05.39]You're not sure what is happening, but you're dying and all your dreams are gone.
[34:08.41]The man stops dragging you and shouts something in another language.
[34:12.12]Suddenly, a woman appears out of the crowd.
[34:17.16]Please help me.
[34:18.34]I am dying.
[34:28.13]You say, please help me, I'm dying.
[34:29.45]She turns and leaves.
[34:32.06]You're left there to die.
[34:37.06]In the end.
[34:48.51]I spell... Resurrect as a phoenix.
[34:55.64]You resurrect as a phoenix.
[34:57.12]You become a phoenix and spread your glorious ashes to the wind.
[35:01.24]What?
[35:07.67]Who dares?
[35:11.31]Not.
[35:11.93]Who dares not?
[35:12.69]How do you talk like in fucking old tongue?
[35:15.48]Who dares not give

[35:36.74]I got this now.
[35:37.36]I might as well use it.
[35:39.48]Who dares not give aid to thou in need?
[35:44.39]There is no answer.
[35:45.17]You feel a great sense of loss.
[35:47.01]You've lost all of your powers, as well as your ability to fly.
[35:50.01]You are now immortal again, although with a lot less pain.
[35:56.36]Oh, man.
[35:56.92]That's not good.
[35:57.70]Okay.
[35:58.98]Uh... Ask where... Say, where am I?
[36:08.12]I want to know what the village is.
[36:16.96]You say, where am I?
[36:17.70]You stand on a beach.
[36:18.48]There's no one in sight.
[36:19.32]Suddenly, you feel a cold wind blowing.
[36:20.82]You look up to see a storm storm.
[36:22.60]Go surfing.
[36:25.33]Go surfing.
[36:32.73]You walk out into the waves.
[36:34.11]They are gentle at first, but soon they become much bigger than you could have imagined.

[37:32.42]You walk into the bar and see that it's filled with tourists.
[37:35.15]Right.
[37:36.35]You order a drink and you notice there's no bartender.
[37:38.65]There are several round tables in the bar, each with its own bartender.
[37:46.65]Okay.
[37:48.79]Walk up to bartender and present annoying coupon.
[38:05.28]You walk up to the bartender and present an annoying coupon.
[38:08.08]The bartender looks at you like you're an idiot.
[38:10.64]You explain that the drink is on the house.
[38:13.30]He says that only happens if you buy a round of drinks for the entire table.
[38:19.37]Buy a round of drinks for the entire table.
[38:28.52]Now I'm going to get my free drink.
[38:32.46]You walk up to the bartender and give him your drink coupon.

[39:05.55]Do you have anything fruity without gin?
[39:21.56]You say, I want a vodka drink, but I don't really feel like vodka.
[39:24.02]Do you have anything like fruity that doesn't have any gin in it?
[39:26.60]Bartender pours you a drink and says, here's your drink.
[39:29.76]But don't you dare tell anyone that this is on the house.

[40:12.29]I got this drink for free.
[40:13.55]The bartender grabs you and says, you can't just give this away for free.
[40:16.95]Where do you come from?

[40:47.45]Like Los Angeles, you know what I mean?
[40:58.37]You say, I come from Los Angeles.
[41:00.99]He shakes his head and he walks away.
[41:03.53]You get a tap on the shoulder and turn around.
[41:05.83]It's the bartender.
[41:12.64]Uh, okay, hold on.
[41:15.94]Look behind me.
[41:23.55]Nothing personal.
[41:25.07]Where the hell did you get this drink from for free?
[41:26.87]From the bartender.
[41:52.00]Smash, drink on his head.
[41:55.68]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[41:56.58]We're going to befriend this guy.
[41:59.60]Put all the blame on the bartender.
[42:03.61]I got it from the bartender for free.
[42:07.49]I got it from the bartender.
[42:15.39]I got it from the bartender.
[42:16.47]He stares at you and doesn't reply.
[42:17.63]He keeps on walking.
[42:18.65]You feel very scared and start trembling.
[42:20.52]He continues walking towards the exit.
[42:24.16]Say, don't let the door hit you.
[42:36.84]Turns around, looks at you, and laughs.
[42:39.00]He begins to let go of the door, but then it slams into you and throws you on the ground.
[42:44.02]Ow, my shoulder!
[42:48.20]Wait, was I behind him?
[42:49.93]Was I walking out with him?
[42:51.11]Did I just... Did that thing just happen where somebody holds the door for you, and it's a heavy door, and you don't realize it, and they let go right when you get kind of too close, and the door fucking crushes you, and you're like, oh, fuck!
[43:05.73]That happens all the time to me.
[43:09.84]And it almost breaks your hand, and you try to pretend like it doesn't hurt.
[43:13.15]You're like, oh, ow.
[43:14.89]Oh, thanks, man.
[43:16.67]Ow, my shoulder.
[43:21.59]Okay, how about... It throws you into the ground.
[43:27.96]Say, be more careful.
[43:38.61]You say, be more careful.
[43:39.55]The door closes and the angry man disappears.
[43:41.53]You stand up and see that you're in a kitchen.
[43:44.25]You walk around and notice that there are several exit doors, all leading into other rooms in the house.
[43:54.80]Uh, find the bartender.
[44:00.14]Find the bear-tender.
[44:01.46]Shit.
[44:09.70]You find the bear tender.
[44:10.96]You walk into a room with a big man in it.
[44:12.77]You try to speak, but he grabs you by the shirt collar.
[44:16.13]Who the hell are you?
[44:16.99]Oh.
[44:22.22]I'm the boss.
[44:24.94]Get your hands off me.
[44:35.50]He doesn't respond, he just continues to stare at you.
[44:37.62]You notice there are several people watching you from the corners of your eyes.
[44:41.87]Let me go, you're hurting me.
[44:46.92]Alright, fuck it.
[44:48.26]Grab him.
[44:50.14]By the shirt.
[44:51.60]Like he's doing to me.
[45:00.00]You grab him by the shirt, you pull him closer to you, and he pushes you away and runs away.
[45:03.72]You don't chase him, you turn around to the kitchen.
[45:12.46]Chase him!
[45:16.55]No, I ain't gonna get, like, beat up four times.
[45:20.11]You chase him.
[45:20.77]You look behind the kitchen and see that he's gone.
[45:22.45]You walk back to the living room.
[45:24.29]You continue looking for him, but he's gone.
[45:26.27]Suddenly, you feel your phone vibrating in your pocket.
[45:34.39]Alright, answer the phone or add some story in where I see him hiding behind the couch.
[45:44.53]Tell him to answer the phone.
[45:51.57]Hand the phone to the man and have him answer it.
[46:04.08]Hand the phone to the man.
[46:06.70]Have him answer it.
[46:10.78]He's gone.
[46:12.26]Find the man and have him answer the phone.
[46:23.61]You find the man and have him answer the phone.
[46:25.55]You look for the man, but you don't see him.
[46:28.80]Suddenly your phone stops vibrating.
[46:30.50]You wonder where he is.
[46:31.42]Then you get a notification.
[46:33.12]Someone just messaged you.
[46:38.76]Look at the message.
[46:45.71]You look at the message.
[46:46.33]It's a message from a girl.
[46:48.17]She says that she saw your video.
[46:50.15]She also says that the video went viral and you have over 300,000 views in one hour.

[49:51.93]The iPhone 5 sucks.
[49:52.85]I hope you got a new phone.
[49:54.37]No, I still have the same phone.
[49:56.49]You stop talking.
[49:57.34]There's no response for a while.
[49:58.82]Are you still there?
[50:01.16]Yeah, I'm here.
[50:02.76]Okay, so here's what happened.
[50:12.39]So I didn't reply.
[50:14.67]Because, alright, I'm kind of done with this conversation.
[50:17.21]I don't really care that much about this conversation.
[50:19.84]And I got the, are you still there?
[50:21.80]How, I don't know, how much time passed?
[50:27.30]Like, shit.
[50:28.52]If I don't say, yes, I'm still here, then I'm an asshole, right?
[50:32.39]I'm that, like, what a dick.
[50:33.49]You're not gonna reply?
[50:34.31]Um, yeah, I'm here.
[50:37.19]Now I've committed to the conversation.
[50:41.89]How are your 15 kids?
[50:46.41]I don't know.
[50:46.85]Like, what do you even talk about?
[50:53.59]You say, how are your 15 kids?
[50:55.81]They're fine, you?
[50:57.45]Oh, it's the hardest job I've ever had.
[50:59.29]Right, you don't respond for a while.
[51:05.94]So, do you know where the nearest hospital is?
[51:12.04]Who is saying that, though?
[51:14.00]Am I saying that to her, or is she saying that to me?
[51:16.70]I think that's her saying that to me.
[51:19.99]Is this the 16th kid?
[51:25.12]Is this for the 16th kid?
[51:34.23]You say, is this for the 16th kid?
[51:36.25]Ha, yeah.
[51:38.13]There's a long pause and you can hear her heavy breathing.
[51:42.01]I need to go.
[51:47.53]I love you.
[51:50.73]You don't respond.
[51:58.11]Oh my goodness.
[52:02.60]Wait a second.
[52:03.36]Wait a second.
[52:04.10]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[52:04.90]Hold on, folks.
[52:07.54]From last year?
[52:08.70]What do you mean from... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[52:21.20]Hold on.
[52:22.60]Your phone rings and I stopped.
[52:25.06]I didn't answer it.
[52:26.36]I wanted somebody else to answer the phone for me.
[52:29.61]You look at a message and it's from a girl who says, I saw your video.
[52:33.41]Do you remember me?
[52:34.01]Yeah, I remember you.
[52:35.79]I think from last year.
[52:36.85]Yeah, do you remember last year?
[52:40.42]Yeah, I remember.
[52:41.26]Oh boy.
[52:46.60]This is not good.
[52:47.56]Um...
[52:50.37]What the fuck?
[52:51.32]This is- it's my kid.
[52:56.82]How- you don't- we don't know that.
[53:16.06]You say, am I the father?
[53:17.10]There's another long pause before she responds.
[53:19.18]Yeah, you're the father.
[53:22.31]I can't be with you.
[53:23.73]There's a third pause before you respond.
[53:25.49]I...
[53:47.40]I'm not just gonna hang up.
[53:48.70]That's fucked up.
[53:49.80]Uh... Can their name be... Gary?
[54:04.53]No.
[54:04.83]Can their name be... Fruit Snacks?
[54:18.00]Can their name be fruit snacks?
[54:20.32]What?
[54:21.32]Their name can be fruit snacks.
[54:23.57]I don't know if that's allowed.
[54:26.07]Fine.
[54:34.27]This is not...
[54:42.55]Uh, I can't wait to see little fruit snacks.
[54:59.48]You say, I can't wait to see little fruit snacks.
[55:03.60]I love you.
[55:04.78]There's a pause.
[55:06.32]Bye.
[55:07.60]You send the message and put your phone down.
[55:10.39]A few minutes later, you get a message.
[55:12.07]It's from her.
[55:12.71]Hello?
[55:21.00]You say hello.
[55:22.10]I'm pregnant.
[55:23.74]You don't respond.
[55:24.34]It's with twins.
[55:27.39]We need to meet up.
[55:29.47]You don't respond.
[55:50.73]Can the other one be named Fruit Snacks, too?
[55:53.38]There's a pause.
[55:55.26]Fine.
[55:58.14]You stand up and walk out the door.
[55:59.68]The woman walks in as you're getting in your car.
[56:01.72]Thanks for doing that.
[56:02.98]It means a lot.
[56:08.20]Okay, go meet.
[56:11.38]Go meet.
[56:13.86]Go meet her.
[56:15.53]Or go meet... Go meet my pregnant girlfriend?
[56:19.77]What should I write?
[56:23.48]Go meet Kate.
[56:33.38]You go meet Kate.
[56:33.96]You walk into the cafe.
[56:35.08]Hey, you're here.
[56:35.66]I was waiting for you.
[56:36.68]Yeah, I got your message.
[56:37.60]What's this about?
[56:41.54]I press enter, right?
[56:42.30]You need help?
[56:54.00]Yeah, it's a pretty big deal.
[56:54.90]It involves you and some of your friends.
[57:20.73]Where are the kids?
[57:26.05]I'm a wizard.
[57:30.85]Say, where are the kids?
[57:31.69]They're over there.
[57:32.85]You nod and head to your friends.
[57:35.29]You walk into the cafe and see a group of kids sitting in a corner.
[57:37.95]They look alike.
[57:40.15]But you can tell they're different people.
[57:43.85]Wait, what do you mean they look... Wait, what?
[57:59.12]Wait, these kids are my friends?
[58:02.16]Wait, I don't understand what's happening.
[58:07.01]What do you mean they look alike but they're different people?
[58:10.85]What?
[58:11.21]Hi, kids.
[58:19.75]What's going on?
[58:31.87]You say, hi kids, they turn to look at you.
[58:33.41]Hey, we're waiting for Kate.
[58:35.74]Nod and wait for Kate to arrive.
[58:37.04]You're the one that took my picture, right?
[58:45.36]But who's saying, who's telling me this?
[58:54.67]Um.
[58:57.14]Say, no, I, I, no, I, I did not take a, any, no, I didn't, just no.
[59:04.83]I didn't take a picture of Kate?
[59:09.49]Say, no, yeah, I am.
[59:11.29]I'm going to help you, but I need you to do something for me.
[59:14.88]What?
[59:18.32]Never talk to or contact me ever again.
[59:20.42]Can you do that?
[59:22.94]Yeah, of course.
[59:23.94]Good, now say hi to the kids.
[59:30.77]Wait, hold on.
[59:31.23]Are all 15, 16 of these kids my kids?
[59:35.95]And they're my friends?
[59:41.29]How?
[59:50.22]Um, okay.
[59:52.36]Never talk to me again.
[59:53.06]Can I do that?
[59:53.56]Yeah, okay.
[59:54.32]Go say hi to the kids.
[59:58.53]Go to the kids.
[60:01.18]Go over to the kids.
[60:04.40]And what, say hello?
[60:08.06]You walk over to the kids and give a little wave.
[60:09.95]Hi, kids!
[60:12.85]Hi!
[60:16.67]Um... Make sure you... I don't know, what should I say?
[60:23.46]Make sure you try to do good in school and do good in school.
[60:32.20]I don't know.
[60:34.56]This is making me, like, sad.
[60:43.14]One more thing.
[60:43.48]Make sure you do good in school.
[60:44.78]Okay, one more thing.
[60:45.46]Don't tell your parents about any of this.
[60:46.92]If you do, I can't help you.
[60:48.06]Oh, great.
[60:48.56]That's all.
[60:50.44]Don't tell... I... It's me.
[60:58.87]Don't tell your parents that you're gonna do good in school?
[61:05.35]Go back to Kate.
[61:14.54]You walk over to Kate, who's already sitting down.
[61:16.12]So.
[61:16.94]Ah, there she is.
[61:17.54]The man gets up and the two of you head out the door.
[61:21.24]What?
[61:24.64]Who is this?
[61:25.28]You say, who is this?
[61:31.38]She's a good friend.
[61:32.69]Just don't expect her to be your typical escort.
[61:46.26]Wait.
[61:47.90]You shake your head and continue walking.
[61:49.52]How much is it going to cost?
[61:54.08]Wait.
[62:01.38]Just fucking sprint out of the bar.
[62:05.33]You sprint out of the bar and run down the street.
[62:07.33]SETTLE DOWN THERE!
[62:08.73]You skid to a halt and find yourself in front of the police station.
[62:25.27]Sit on the sidewalk.
[62:39.40]You slump against the building and fall into the sidewalk.
[62:41.30]You sit and think about what to do.
[62:42.56]Suddenly your phone rings.
[62:43.34]You fall out of your pocket and see that it's Claire's number.
[62:45.62]Hmm.
[62:52.80]Oh no.
[62:53.73]Answer the phone.
[62:58.47]Hey, it's me!
[63:00.27]Claire, is everything okay?
[63:01.17]Did something happen?
[63:11.60]Everything's fine.
[63:18.84]I just wanted to see how you are.
[63:19.96]I'm fine, thanks.
[63:20.54]I'm just having lunch with some friends.
[63:21.92]It looks like I might be here a while.
[63:34.77]How are you doing?
[63:45.06]You say, how are you doing?
[63:45.88]I'm fine.
[63:46.22]Just wanted to see how you're doing.
[63:47.12]Do you want me to meet up later?
[63:48.34]That'd be good.
[63:48.98]Okay.
[63:53.91]Yeah, I have magical powers.
[63:58.91]Heat the phone?
[63:59.55]Heat the phone.
[64:14.81]You eat the phone.
[64:15.65]You put the phone back in your pocket and go eat your food.
[64:22.80]Okay, go to Claire's.
[64:29.24]Am I just in these big magician robes with a magician's hat on?
[64:33.04]Like a wizard hat?
[64:36.66]Weren't we supposed to be in medieval times?
[64:38.63]What's going on?
[64:46.60]You go to Claire's.
[64:47.12]You get in your car and you drive over to Claire's house.
[64:49.06]You pull into the driveway and kill the engine.
[64:51.31]You sit there in the silence for a moment before grabbing the package of cigarettes and pulling one out.
[65:02.49]Smoke all the cigarettes.
[65:04.67]Smoke all of them.
[65:07.73]At one time.
[65:08.89]Smoke all of them at once.
[65:16.06]You pull out your lighter and light the cigarette.
[65:17.52]As you take your first drag, you notice a man watching you.
[65:19.57]He's average height and weight and is wearing a dark blue shirt.
[65:31.26]Roll down the window.
[65:38.96]You roll down the window.
[65:39.82]You stick your head out of the window and motion the man to come over.
[65:41.77]He nods and walks over.
[65:44.12]What can I do for you, sir?
[65:45.62]I'm looking for Claire.
[65:50.43]I'm here to see her.
[65:52.13]Who are you?
[65:54.49]I'm her boyfriend.
[65:56.43]Well, you can't just show up at my house like this.
[65:58.47]Can I see some identification?
[66:02.50]Okay, show him my Chuck E. Cheese membership card.
[66:23.14]Show him my Chuck E. Cheese Platinum membership card.
[66:36.43]You show him your Chuck E. Cheese Platinum membership card.
[66:38.91]He looks at you and turns it over.
[66:41.27]I see you're a member of Platinum.
[66:43.51]But I don't see that you have any other special privileges.
[66:47.01]I have the only card.
[66:58.33]Show him my Dave and Buster's membership card.
[67:16.62]Show him your Dave and Buster's membership card.
[67:18.30]He looks at it and turns it over.
[67:19.98]I see that you're a member of Dave and Buster's, but I don't see that you have any other special privileges.
[67:28.07]Show him my VIP.
[67:38.44]My VIP Costco card.
[67:44.89]My VIP Costco card.
[67:47.51]My VIP Blockbuster card.
[68:00.38]No, no, no, no, no.
[68:01.34]Show him my... Yeah.
[68:03.10]You show him your VIP Blockbuster card.
[68:15.01]I see you're a member of the VIP Blockbuster card, but I don't see that you have any other special privileges.
[68:20.35]They don't matter.
[68:35.75]Show him my American Express Metal Millionaire card.
[68:53.24]Let me see.
[68:54.36]I see that you're a member of the American Express Metal Millionaire.
[68:58.12]I don't see that you have any other special preference.
[69:00.74]Show him my boating license.
[69:13.26]I sure remember the voting license, but it doesn't matter to me.
[69:16.72]God damn it, man.
[69:29.15]Okay.
[69:36.50]I sure remember the 3% back rewards, but I don't see that you have any other special privileges.
[69:47.00]I didn't even say that.
[69:49.26]Show him my special privileges.
[69:53.34]No, show him my skeleton key.
[70:03.47]I see you're a member of the access card, but I don't see that you have any other special privileges.
[70:09.77]I'm just going to write on a piece of paper special privileges and then hand it to him.
[70:27.35]Thank you, Jesus.
[70:57.75]A man leads you through a foyer into a living room.
[70:59.77]There's a leather chair and a table in the middle of the room with a beautiful vase on the table.
[71:08.24]Turn vase upside down.
[71:15.88]Or... Wait.
[71:25.04]You turn the vase upside down.
[71:26.24]The vase shatters to pieces as you hear a click from the end table next to the leather chair.
[71:30.80]You see a pistol with a silencer on it.
[71:32.96]What?
[71:33.92]Grab the gun.
[71:37.59]I found the secret hidden, like, gun compartment?
[71:44.25]You grab the gun, hold it in your hand, and point it at the man.
[71:46.01]Who the hell are you?
[71:51.25]What the hell are you doing?
[71:54.96]My name is Lewis.
[71:55.58]I'm a cop.
[71:56.04]This is my apartment and these are some of my firearms.
[71:57.94]Put the gun down.
[72:03.42]Okay.
[72:07.36]Put the gun down.
[72:08.16]Why do you have a gun?
[72:08.96]People I work for are very organized.
[72:11.10]They're great at getting what they want and they always get it.
[72:20.15]Why do I have to ask?
[72:22.49]What am I, in school?
[72:26.75]Can I use the bathroom?
[72:28.29]Sure, it's just down the hall and to the left.
[72:30.87]You walk into the hallway and look at your reflection in the mirror.
[72:33.63]You are a skinny kid with no facial hair or muscle tone.
[72:37.90]Wait, why am I a skinny kid?
[72:39.88]Oh, fuck, this still says I'm playing the other game, doesn't it?
[72:53.94]Shit, hold on.
[72:55.31]Wait, hunting for treasure chests.
[72:56.75]That's real.
[72:59.67]I can stay.
[73:00.05]Okay, you flex in the mirror.
[73:09.69]You flex your bicep.
[73:10.67]You notice the gun in your hands.
[73:13.49]We need to talk about what the gun is talking to me.
[73:20.40]Put it down.
[73:28.11]You put it down.
[73:28.75]It's sort of private.
[73:29.59]I'm sure it is, but the more people who know what's going on, the safer it is.
[73:31.85]It's not that big of a deal.
[73:33.33]Why is a gun talking to me?
[73:37.10]Shoot the mirror.
[73:42.38]You fire the gun and the mirror shatters.
[73:44.24]You stare at your reflection and go into the bathroom.
[73:46.86]You stare at yourself in the mirror for a while.
[73:48.24]What are you doing in there?
[73:49.10]What the heck?
[73:52.35]What are you doing in there?
[73:59.48]Shoot in the toilet.
[74:08.40]You put the gun under the toilet and pull the trigger.
[74:11.43]What?
[74:14.11]Like in the toilet bowl in the water?
[74:19.59]What was that?
[74:21.11]It was nothing.
[74:22.51]You don't seem very convincing.
[74:25.47]Well, I'm not.
[74:42.20]You wash your face with the toilet water and flush it.
[74:45.07]Don't do that!
[74:46.89]Why not?
[74:48.15]Because some of us can still use a mirror, are you crazy?
[75:03.86]What else?
[75:04.70]There's gotta be more after that.
[75:08.74]You're not gonna give me anything?
[75:16.28]It's just easier.
[75:17.26]I don't care if it's easy.
[75:18.56]I like looking at myself in the mirror.
[75:20.90]Well, you're not my type anyways.
[75:22.12]What?
[75:49.16]Okay, leave.
[75:51.48]Leave.
[75:52.00]Leave.
[75:52.92]Leave.
[75:53.56]Exit.
[75:57.03]Okay.
[75:57.39]Alright.
[75:57.77]Okay.
[75:58.13]Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright.

[76:58.97]How much do we have?
[77:00.43]About $7,000.
[77:01.33]I don't see any masks or guns.
[77:04.88]We don't need them.
[77:06.48]Oh, why not?
[77:08.06]Because the tellers are too busy panicking to notice anything.
[77:11.04]Do we have a get out of jail free card?
[77:14.12]No.
[77:15.22]And what the hell is the point?
[77:16.84]Because this really isn't that serious.
[77:19.46]When you got nothing but time, I'm sure you'll explain it all.
[77:32.64]Take all the money and s- Give it to everyone in the store!
[77:46.79]Spend it on candy.
[77:54.96]Take all the money and give it to everyone in the store.
[77:56.40]That's a really stupid idea.
[77:58.28]Why?
[77:58.54]Because the robbers will get caught and we'll get fired.
[78:08.06]Ask him if the Joker put him up to it?
[78:21.49]Where's the Joker?
[78:25.01]Been missing a lot by not using the Dragon AI model.
[78:29.32]Is that in this website?
[78:32.68]Where's the Joker?
[78:33.78]What happened?
[78:34.90]We had a small disagreement and he left.
[78:36.64]Who is this guy?
[78:38.01]Dude, dragon AI.
[78:39.13]You have to pay premium for it.

[78:55.14]It's worth it.
[78:55.98]We'll do it again.
[78:59.82]Is Fall Guys ready to play yet?
[79:11.68]Don't tell me yes it is if it's not.

[79:24.01]Hold on.
