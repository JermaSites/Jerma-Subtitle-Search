[00:17.77]He's got an arrow.
[00:20.90]He's got bow and arrow.
[00:24.42]He's trying to shoot me.
[00:26.16]He's trying to kill... I was just going to say hi to this guy.
[00:34.00]I'm coming up to a turn here soon.
[00:38.23]So we will eventually find each other sometime in the near future.

[00:48.21]I'm jumping.
[00:48.79]I'm jumping.
[00:50.29]Oh, yeah.
[00:50.73]Let's not kill each other immediately so we don't have to do this again.
[00:54.44]Oh, no.
[00:54.94]Why did you do this?
[00:59.16]Wait, I have five seconds for someone to revive me.
[01:01.16]How do I revive you?
[01:04.25]I don't know how to revive you.
[01:06.19]Hold on, I'll go get meat.
[01:07.11]I'll be back.
[01:08.29]What?
[01:09.13]There's a guy with meat over here.
[01:10.21]I'll just take it from him.
[01:12.39]Hey, there's somebody in desperate need of meat over here.
[01:15.73]Please, you have to help us.
[01:17.19]I can, like, rotate the camera and watch.
[01:18.89]Come on, come over here, quick.
[01:21.07]Follow me.
[01:22.91]Look, see?
[01:23.54]There's somebody in trouble.
[01:25.00]Where are you?
[01:25.80]Where's your body?
[01:26.80]I'm, like, right ahead of you.
[01:28.24]He's walking past me, though.
[01:29.74]Look, come here.
[01:30.80]Please help us.
[01:32.30]He's coming.
[01:33.02]He's coming.
[01:34.28]Please.
[01:35.23]He needs help.
[01:36.63]He needs someone to revive him.
[01:37.85]What if he just, like, figures out what happened?
[01:41.03]There he goes.
[01:41.59]You, like, lured him to my corpse and then slaughtered him.
[01:45.63]It's my meat.
[01:47.43]Get out of here.
[01:48.39]Are you serious?
[01:50.02]Are you kidding me right now?
[01:51.14]This guy killed me.
[01:52.34]Yeah.
[01:56.58]And he's gonna get all my stuff.
[01:57.94]Hang on, I'm coming.
[02:00.16]What'd he kill you with?
[02:02.31]Uh, axe.
[02:03.53]There's two guys.
[02:05.13]Is it two?
[02:07.77]No, it's just one.
[02:08.37]You were glitched.
[02:09.71]I'm coming up behind him, Jerma!
[02:11.09]I'm coming up behind him!
[02:11.83]Revenge!
[02:13.75]I got him!
[02:14.57]I killed him!
[02:15.53]Revenge is sweet!
[02:16.93]There's so many wood piles and stones in there.
[02:19.81]No, was it five wood for a rope?
[02:25.24]What the?
[02:25.64]Maybe it's a couple other, maybe it's more than one stone.
[02:29.96]That's definitely more than one stone.
[02:31.12]It's probably, like, two or three stone.
[02:38.53]How do you make, like, the little cages?
[02:42.63]You know, like, you saw those, like, wooden cages that you can imprison people?
[02:46.31]Maybe it's, like, 20 wood or something.
[02:48.63]Probably.
[02:49.21]It's just made of sticks.
[02:54.76]How do you make rope?
[02:57.29]Why am I, like, can I not figure this out?
[03:00.27]I saw it before.
[03:03.23]Arrows, bolas, fu- Whoa!
[03:04.74]Whoa!
[03:05.14]Whoa!
[03:06.10]What was that?
[03:07.12]What was that?
[03:07.94]What was what?
[03:08.78]Somebody just, like, threw something at me.
[03:10.52]I- Someone just whizzed right by- Oh!
[03:12.32]I'm- I'm- I'm- Somebody's got me!
[03:13.80]Somebody's got me!
[03:16.09]Is that you?
[03:17.93]Oh, you!
[03:20.65]You're coming with me!
[03:21.75]Dude, I thought- Dude, you- I thought we were going to-
[03:25.50]attack and it's just you being an idiot.
[03:29.00]I'm taking you back to show my family my new capture.
[03:32.89]Please let me go.
[03:33.41]That's so funny how you're just like dragging along the ground.
[03:36.59]Dude, you seriously scared the ever living hell out of me.
[03:40.23]I got you in my cave.
[03:41.81]This is my teepee where we cook prisoners.
[03:45.35]You can, like, crawl?
[03:47.63]Get me out of here!
[03:49.11]Get me out of here!
[03:49.69]How do I, like, free you?
[03:50.81]It says you don't trust me.
[03:54.73]You let go.
[03:55.77]You, like, let go of the rope.
[03:57.49]And then, like, I think I can, like, yeah, I can get out if I'm doing it right now.
[04:01.57]I don't see anyone yet.
[04:03.02]I don't see anybody yet either.
[04:04.06]You gotta cross the river.
[04:05.28]Okay, you with the bow, like, strung and ready.
[04:11.10]Just doing a little bit of prep work.
[04:13.93]If you hit somebody from this far away, I would be so impressed.
[04:17.15]Yeah, that's like a million dollar shot.
[04:18.73]If there was one guy over there, like, fishing, and you... I would say take the shot, just to see.
[04:24.02]Just to see if I can get him?
[04:25.34]Yeah.
[04:26.26]There's nobody there.
[04:27.64]I don't even see your name tag.
[04:30.51]I'm, like, right above it.
[04:31.99]There's a guy here.
[04:32.43]Wait, there's a guy here?
[04:33.25]There's a guy there?
[04:33.79]Yep.
[04:33.89]Where is he?
[04:37.14]Unless your name tag disappeared.
[04:38.55]Are you there?
[04:39.59]I'm crouching with a bow and arrow right now.
[04:41.51]But are you in the camp?
[04:42.95]I'm like at the camp.
[04:43.87]I'm not in the camp.
[04:44.27]There's a guy in the camp.
[04:45.33]There's a guy in the camp?
[04:46.65]Yeah, there's a guy in the camp.
[04:48.03]Where is he?
[04:48.61]I'm hiding underwater right now.
[04:49.83]I don't know.
[04:51.13]Is he... Are you sure that's not me crouching around?
[04:53.83]Are you next to the fire?
[04:55.48]No.
[04:56.16]Well, there was a guy next to the fireplace.
[04:58.42]Standing next to the fireplace.
[04:59.60]Alright, I'm getting closer.
[05:00.86]I see you now, but I didn't... There was another guy.
[05:03.83]Oh, wow.
[05:04.43]Yeah, yeah, yeah, he is.
[05:05.21]He's inside the hut.
[05:05.83]He's inside the hut right now.
[05:08.23]What are we going to do?
[05:09.27]I don't know.
[05:09.53]What do we do?
[05:11.85]Do I take the shot?
[05:13.42]Yeah, take the shot.
[05:14.50]Take the shot?
[05:15.18]Take the shot.
[05:15.88]Take the shot.
[05:18.06]I think I hit him.
[05:19.68]Did I hit him?
[05:20.30]Follow it up.
[05:22.86]No.
[05:26.87]What?
[05:29.27]Did I get him now?
[05:31.52]Am I hitting this guy with arrows or what is going on here?
[05:34.51]I see the arrow like floating by the tree.
[05:40.85]I got him.
[05:43.19]He just like point blank shot him with an arrow.
[05:47.75]Now what?
[05:49.98]I don't know.
[05:50.38]We take his stuff.
[05:51.40]I just brought him back to life.
[05:53.53]Why, Jerva, why?
[05:54.79]I don't know.
[05:55.49]It was fun.
[05:56.91]How did- Oh!
[05:57.99]Oh, it's the berries!
[05:59.89]The thing that we mined in the cave!
[06:01.55]Oh!
[06:02.28]They let you revive?
[06:03.70]Yes, they let you revive.
[06:04.68]Don't die!
[06:05.36]Don't die!
[06:05.98]We can't bring you back!
[06:06.76]Oh, shit.
[06:06.92]Now I gotta kill him.
[06:07.38]I gotta get rid of him again.
[06:08.16]I don't want him coming back.
[06:10.68]Because then he'll like know what happened.
[06:13.71]He like came back and then you killed him again!
[06:15.95]Uh...
[06:17.46]What the hell is that?
[06:18.34]Is that lava?
[06:19.70]Oh!
[06:20.42]Oh, Jerma!
[06:21.74]Oh, no!
[06:22.52]Oh, no!
[06:25.58]There's lava down here.
[06:27.92]Did you just die?
[06:29.10]Can you come, like, pillage my body?
[06:30.54]I can just see... Can you find a way down here and take my stuff?
[06:35.90]And then heal me?
[06:36.52]There's a giant cave over here, too.
[06:39.76]Oh, my gosh.
[06:40.64]You just fell in.
[06:41.12]Sounds like a looney tune.
[06:41.86]It's like...
[06:43.55]Is there any way for you to get down there?
[06:45.31]We're going.
[06:45.99]We're going down.
[06:46.57]What do you mean you're going down?
[06:48.09]We're coming down.
[06:49.09]I don't think I can revive you, though.
[06:51.37]Where are you coming down?
[06:53.05]Hi, Jerma.
[06:54.47]I'm stuck.
[06:56.77]Oh, you're up there.
[06:57.67]If you try to make this jump, you're dead.
[07:01.63]I'm dead.
[07:02.47]I'm stuck, though.
[07:03.99]I jumped down this rock.
[07:06.07]Try to make it down here.
[07:06.93]Can you slide down here?
[07:09.71]Hang on.
[07:10.55]There's like a gap, though.
[07:13.00]Yeah, you can mind the gap.
[07:14.30]You can jump.
[07:14.98]Mind the gap, he says.
[07:17.17]Oh dear.
[07:17.61]Alright, you ready for this jump?
[07:19.15]You ready for this sweet jump?
[07:24.29]Oh no!
[07:25.09]I died too!
[07:26.11]We did it!
[07:28.91]Stopping land is so much good fun!
[07:44.66]Thank you.
