[04:06.66]Hey, the funniest part about this... If we light on fire, we're never gonna get out in time.
[04:11.37]We're gonna not suddenly walk through the door.
[04:16.22]Oh, things on fire, might as well, like, walk, like, very slowly.
[04:18.98]Oh!
[04:20.14]Oh, that stopped us more than I thought it would.

[05:49.41]There's another one coming.
[05:51.11]There's another one.

[06:02.99]Slow down.
[06:03.79]Slow down so they can catch up.
[06:06.09]Slow down a little bit.
[06:07.39]Let's all line up.
[06:07.97]Let's all line up.
[06:08.95]Line up, and they're gonna go off at the same time.
[06:10.49]This is gonna be epic.
[06:12.03]Okay, go.
[06:14.54]Alright, here we go.
[06:16.02]Oh my god!
[06:18.72]Make sure you hit the jump.
[06:20.61]Alright, here we go.
[06:21.21]Jerma seems to be in the lead.
[06:23.19]I'll shoot his tires so he's not moving.
[06:25.37]Dodge the cops.
[06:26.57]Dodge the cops.
[06:27.77]There's so many.
[06:29.60]I think we lost Boo.
[06:32.52]Okay.
[06:34.20]Jump out.
[06:37.08]Parachute.
[06:37.76]Did my car just hit somebody?
[06:39.32]No.
[06:40.60]Oh, no.
[06:41.20]Oh, my God.
[06:44.66]I could just see him coming straight at us.
