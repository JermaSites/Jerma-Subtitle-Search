[00:01.77]Alright, now we're going to move on.
[00:05.21]We're going to play Cook Serve Delicious 2.
[00:12.49]For the remainder of our chill-out stream.
[00:22.57]Let's go ahead and close this and open it up.
[00:25.81]That's a thing?
[00:26.37]Yeah, it is a thing, apparently.
[00:38.19]They're making a third.
[00:39.39]Are they really making a third?
[00:44.57]How do you make this game three times?
[00:50.00]Do you add?
[00:50.70]What do you add to it?
[00:58.36]More recipes?
[01:00.46]No, Xbox Game Bar.
[01:03.16]Xbox Game Bar.
[01:03.84]I don't want to take a fucking screenshot.
[01:10.15]You know what I think the weirdest thing in the world is?
[01:12.65]Why... Why is Xbox trying to tell me I can take a screenshot with their Xbox game thing?
[01:20.08]It's like, you just hit print screen.
[01:24.36]And just paste it, like, why?
[01:30.08]Hey, in case you know it, you can take a screenshot of this game, I know.
[01:33.17]I know, it's a button on my keyboard.
[01:35.39]That has been a function for 30 fucking years.
[01:39.90]What?
[01:45.35]This song is kind of bopping, I'll tell you though.
[01:50.35]Let me change the game.
[01:56.41]Cook, Serve, Delicious 2.
[01:58.41]Is this better than the first one?
[02:07.87]No, no, yes, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes, no, no, no.
[02:10.67]Hm.
[02:12.63]Hm.
[02:13.65]We'll find out.
[02:15.70]Start game.
[02:16.24]Here we go.
[02:17.16]Uh, local saves.
[02:18.12]Cloud saves.
[02:18.84]I don't have any saves.
[02:22.00]Local save.
[02:23.30]New slave, new slave slot.
[02:24.94]New save slot.
[02:26.56]I can't fucking talk.
[02:27.82]New save slot.
[02:33.06]It began like any other morning at Sherry's Soda Tower.
[02:38.69]You rode the elevator up to your platinum star restaurant.
[02:40.67]Cook served delicious and reflected warmly upon your culinary brilliance and magical powers.
[02:46.05]Life was good.
[02:47.89]Without warning, police surrounded Sherry Soda Tower.
[02:50.49]It seemed company executives were siphoning funds from the corporation, while at the same time incurring a staggering amount of debt, which drained the accounts of the tower and all the businesses inside.
[03:00.28]Everything was put up for federal auction.
[03:02.92]Cook served delicious was no more.
[03:08.75]Angry but determined to rebuild, you purchased a modest commercial space on the 52nd floor of the Terrigan Tower, the largest skyscraper in the city, packed with thousands of ravenous tenants.
[03:21.97]It is here that you will start a brand new cook-serve delicious restaurant.
[03:26.63]Build it back to its former glory.
[03:28.31]Work in other restaurants to rebuild your finances and expand your culinary knowledge.
[03:32.13]And cement your legacy as the best chef in the world.
[03:34.75]Good luck.
[03:35.13]I already am.
[03:35.63]That's what happened in Cook Serve Delicious 1.
[03:37.99]I became the best chef in the world.
[03:41.81]So I already know what I'm doing.
[03:43.97]I already know kind of how to do this.
[03:46.31]But... Oh, no, no, no.
[03:48.45]I don't need to click this.
[03:49.63]I already know how to do this stuff.
[03:54.50]But let's, you know what?
[03:55.62]Let's just do it.
[03:56.24]This is a relaxed stream.
[03:59.56]You're out of practice.
[04:00.20]That's true.
[04:02.40]Yeah, there's the prep stations to your left.
[04:05.44]Where orders appear as customers arrive.
[04:06.88]Enough talk.
[04:07.64]Enough talking.
[04:08.22]Let's cook.
[04:09.38]Select your order by clicking the order on the left or by pressing 1 on your keyboard.
[04:12.62]Alright, 1.
[04:14.66]Whole in one nachos.
[04:16.95]There's the ingredients.
[04:17.83]Yep.
[04:18.89]QSJB.
[04:19.43]QSJB.
[04:23.31]Use the recipe on the bottom of the screen to place the correct ingredients ordered by the customer.
[04:27.14]Alright, so we got queso cream beans.
[04:30.12]So that is queso cream beans.
[04:33.28]I did it in half a second.
[04:36.50]And that's it.
[04:38.72]Press enter.
[04:40.70]Done.
[04:41.71]That's making more complex stuff.
[04:42.85]I'm making a hamburger.
[04:44.85]Place the ingredient and begin to cook.
[04:46.11]M is for meat patty.
[04:49.25]Two patties.
[04:50.25]Oh, those look good.
[04:53.05]Those look good.
[04:53.73]That looks good.
[04:54.33]Alright, let's go.
[04:58.64]The meat is cooking.
[04:59.34]The white timer indicates how long this food has left to cook.
[05:02.80]Once it turns blue, the food is ready to be prepped again.
[05:04.92]Okay.
[05:06.36]So I just wait for it to turn blue.
[05:08.16]Blue.
[05:08.96]Select the order once it turns blue.
[05:11.47]Don't prep it too early or the order will be raw.
[05:15.91]Okay.
[05:16.45]So let's prep it.
[05:18.26]This food has a greater number of ingredients that spans two pages.
[05:22.20]Oh, don't make me do two pages.
[05:23.40]Ingredients have color boxes to the left of them to easily show what page they are on.
[05:29.24]Oh, okay.
[05:34.52]So you press space.
[05:36.61]Press space, click the green space button, or scroll the mouse wheel, or press space.
[05:42.89]Okay.
[05:44.09]Good.
[05:44.89]So this person just wants two meat patties and a regular bun.
[05:49.80]And a regular bun.
[05:52.58]Alright.
[05:54.44]Done.
[05:55.41]Alright, guys, I gotta go.
[05:56.45]I'm gonna make one of these right now.
[05:57.67]I'm outta here.
[05:59.29]The bun looks wet.
[06:00.37]No, that's good.
[06:00.91]You want a little drizzle of fucking oil on it.
[06:04.15]Alright, so that's it.
[06:04.81]Press space, press enter.
[06:05.71]That's good.
[06:06.09]Done.
[06:06.99]And depending on how well you did, you'll get either I'm in chat or I'm scared of something.
[06:11.79]MonkaS.
[06:12.37]Or you'll get, like, react harder.
[06:14.19]Whichever one is better.
[06:19.32]Yep.
[06:21.11]Perfect average or bad rating.
[06:22.27]Always strive for a perfect rating.
[06:27.09]Yeah.
[06:28.41]I'm ready.
[06:31.01]Oh, wait, there's holding stations in this one.
[06:36.55]Holding stations are the key to making things much easier for you when a huge amount of customers walk through the door.
[06:42.26]In fact, if you don't utilize them, the game can become quite difficult and sometimes impossible.
[06:48.29]Try accepting the order on the left.
[06:49.67]You'll notice you cannot select this food.
[06:52.38]It has a red HS icon, meaning that it must be prepared in a holding station before you can serve it.
[06:58.12]Let's do that now.
[07:01.94]Okay.
[07:03.82]Select holding station one by clicking it or by pressing the button combination.
[07:07.24]In this case, hold down tab and press one.
[07:09.54]Tab one.
[07:12.90]Oh, Jesus.
[07:15.26]Select the pretzel and follow the recipe.
[07:16.80]The recipe will be completely random each time you make food in the holding station, so pay close attention to make sure it's done perfectly.
[07:23.84]Select a food to prep.
[07:26.03]Each page has a different category of food.
[07:27.97]Holding station required foods, holding station operational, optional foods, and side dishes.
[07:36.13]Okay, so holding station, pretzel.
[07:41.13]We just want a Jerma pretzel.
[07:43.13]Follow the recipe.
[07:44.03]Just Jerma pretzels.
[07:48.73]Get it in the oven.
[07:51.21]Just like the hamburger, we must wait until the food is finished cooking before we can select it again.
[07:55.83]Holding stations are fully automated.
[07:57.83]Once the food is finished cooking, it will... What did you fucking just say?
[08:00.75]I have to restart the whole game.
[08:02.29]Pretzel's now in the holding station and ready to serve.
[08:04.15]Try selecting the pretzel in the prep station.
[08:08.38]Okay.
[08:09.48]I got four in there.
[08:14.82]Oh.
[08:15.86]So that is ready.
[08:21.09]Oh.
[08:21.67]That's much better than the first game.
[08:24.91]You actually get to put stuff and queue stuff up and have it made already.
[08:31.52]Now we're talking.
[08:33.63]Alright, one serving has been deducted from the holding station.
[08:35.51]You still have three more left to serve to anyone coming in wanting pretzels.
[08:39.30]The food's going to decrease in freshness as the day progresses.
[08:41.30]Once the clock runs out next to the serving number, food must be thrown away.
[08:47.19]Certain things stay fresher longer.
[08:49.43]All holding station orders must be cooked perfectly or they cannot be served.
[08:53.09]Try serving these next three orders.
[08:58.80]Dang.
[09:01.81]See how fast you can serve customers with holding stations?
[09:03.85]They're great.
[09:05.49]You've learned the very basics of the game.
[09:07.05]However, there are still items such as side dishes, chores, drinks, and holding station operational foods that you can learn in the extra tutorials.
[09:13.42]So you should absolutely check those out when you can.
[09:16.42]If you're ready to cook, hop into Max Wiener's.
[09:19.60]I heard they're looking for a good chef.
[09:20.72]Or spend your money over in the food catalog and start building your own menu and cook-serve delicious too.
[09:24.68]Good luck from Mr. Risotto.
[09:26.20]Alright.
[09:29.53]I think I got it.
[09:31.92]Optional foods, side dishes.
[09:33.72]You know, I need to do these.
[09:35.39]It's one minute.
[09:39.61]Holding station optional foods are orders that can either be prepared in a prep station or made ahead of time in a holding station.
[09:44.75]Okay.
[09:48.54]So let's make chicken nugget basket.
[09:50.48]I like these too.
[09:54.14]Place the nuggets.
[09:55.18]Dunk and cook.
[09:57.38]Okay, dunk.
[09:57.88]Is that it?
[10:02.58]Are they cooking?
[10:04.28]Yeah, they are.
[10:06.86]They can be served when finished.
[10:07.84]Serve the order once it's ready.
[10:08.89]Done.
[10:12.95]Alright.
[10:13.51]Cool.
[10:13.67]Ugh, I just want like a bunch of chicken nuggets and hamburgers and shit right now.
[10:20.01]So you can make food beforehand.
[10:21.03]Select holding station 1, then turn the page to the holding station optional foods, and then select chicken nuggets.
[10:26.26]Okay.
[10:26.44]Okay.
[10:28.29]Select a food to prep.
[10:29.32]There are no HS required foods on your menu.
[10:32.44]Okay, here's nuggets.
[10:35.76]So let's just make them.
[10:36.78]So dunk them.
[10:38.64]How many should I make?
[10:40.20]Four.
[10:40.52]Okay.
[10:49.67]Nuggets are almost done.
[10:52.53]Now you have six nuggets.
[10:55.07]Everybody could smell them, so they ran in.
[10:59.65]This is great for pre-rush hour moments when you feel you might have an influx of customers.
[11:02.60]Try serving all the customers that come in.
[11:04.08]I'll do it as fast as I fucking can.
[11:05.30]Here we go, ready?
[11:11.42]Nice.
[11:14.41]Beware, optional foods take up space that might be better used for side dishes or more holding station required foods.
[11:20.65]It'll be up to you to find that perfect balance.
[11:22.33]I'm gonna fucking lose in the first level.
[11:31.99]Everybody's sprinted in.
[11:33.72]This is side dishes.
[11:34.82]This meter will- I'm training!
[11:57.15]This meter will drain as you make more and more perfect foods, and your buzz increases.
[12:00.99]Okay, so I have two seconds.
[12:03.31]To increase cost per patients, we must make side dishes.
[12:05.67]Select holding station one, turn the page to the side dishes, and prepare.
[12:09.38]Okay.
[12:10.56]Side dishes.
[12:12.92]So we make a side salad.
[12:15.66]With lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, croutons, and cucumbers.
[12:20.09]Lettuce.
[12:21.83]That salad sucks.
[12:24.73]This is a terrible salad.
[12:26.49]It's just like iceberg lettuce and like a bunch of shaved... No, I wouldn't eat this.
[12:31.01]And then ATRU.
[12:35.53]Good.
[12:39.08]I got five of these.
[12:41.76]So every unique side dish in your holding station adds 15 seconds to the patience meter.
[12:49.18]Don't act like you eat vegetables.
[12:50.26]I eat vegetables all the damn time.
[12:53.02]You don't look like you eat vegetables.
[12:58.47]I don't act like you eat vegetables.
[13:03.43]For some reason, a lot of you guys think I eat Captain Crunch and hamburger meat.
[13:10.20]No, I eat lots of stuff.
[13:19.70]I drink pineapple juice.
[13:25.13]And McChickens, yeah.
[13:26.25]I got a steady diet of McChickens, Captain Crunch, whole milk, and chicken nuggets.
[13:34.73]No, I am a fucking adult.
[13:37.41]I'm 33 years old.
[13:39.59]I have salads.
[13:41.65]I have good sources of protein.
[13:45.22]Why am I explaining this?
[13:48.48]You guys already know all this.
[13:49.78]One person said I eat Captain Crunch every day and it freaked me out.
[13:54.83]Order a salad right now.
[13:57.58]No, I don't want a salad right now.
[13:59.32]So, I had a salad fucking, like, yesterday.
[14:02.88]Alright, let me pay attention to the game.
[14:08.34]Every unique side dish in your holding station has 15 seconds.
[14:11.44]Okay, you can have up to three unique sides on your menu, which can give you a possible 45 extra seconds of patience.
[14:18.37]This is huge when you have a large influx of customers.
[14:21.96]And we'll always order a random available side dish with their meal, which also increases your income.
[14:25.52]Okay, so you have to have, like, a variety.
[14:28.38]Have at least one side dish in your holding station, as it's an easy way to prevent walkouts and bad orders.
[14:34.00]You want me to do a taste test on spring?
[14:36.09]You can blindfold me.
[14:37.53]You can put a bowl of Captain Crunch with Crunch Berries, and then put a salad on the other side.
[14:43.21]And I'll tell you, I'll taste test.
[14:46.31]With a blindfold on.
[14:51.66]Alright, I'm ready.
[14:54.76]Drinks and delicious.
[14:58.98]Uh, drinks, like I just like, uh, uh, uh, uh, each drink item has a set number of customers it can be served to.
[15:05.27]I think I'm ready.
[15:06.25]Buzz, cool moves, keyboard users can fully remap their keys for holding stations.
[15:11.57]In key options.
[15:13.17]I should check out the options menu, okay.
[15:16.23]Practice chores.
[15:17.09]No, no, no, I don't need to practice chores.
[15:19.01]I have to drink out of the toilet.
[15:22.95]FS.
[15:24.09]Enter.
[15:25.34]Two is load the dishes.
[15:28.10]Begin washing the dishes.
[15:29.18]Wait with the green light.
[15:32.52]Release.
[15:33.18]Unload.
[15:34.22]Sanitize.
[15:34.81]Go.
[15:36.03]Oh, I don't like... Wait, what's going on?
[15:39.47]Why is there a guy with a gun?
[15:40.45]What?
[15:43.09]What?
[15:52.51]Okay, there's a fire?
[15:54.65]Hold on, extinguish!
[15:58.46]There's a fire in the kitchen.
[16:00.60]We can't even, we can't use this.

[17:10.48]This is an all-new campaign where you can run your cook, serve, delicious restaurant, or work in other restaurants across the tower.
[17:17.62]Nailed perfect orders.
[17:19.86]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

[17:21.98]Gain enough yum points, you'll level up.

[17:25.88]Be the best chef in the tower.
[17:26.73]Good luck.
[17:34.44]Standard shift.
[17:36.82]This all looks good.
[17:39.65]I want one of these right now.
[17:43.35]I love this stuff so much.
[17:46.41]Did I tell you that a hot pretzel is probably the best snack you could ever eat?
[17:52.16]A big Bavarian pretzel is just... I'm going to have to get one.
[18:01.28]Okay, if I have a meeting later, and I have like a big Bavarian pretzel, is that not okay?
[18:08.14]Or should I just drink water?
[18:17.25]That's bad?
[18:19.09]What if I order like two big Bavarian pretzels and like mustard and shit and just eat it?
[18:23.97]And talk wicked fucking loud while I'm chewing.
[18:28.06]Alright, let's go.
[18:29.80]Standard shift.

[20:42.29]Oh, fuck.
[20:42.65]Oh, fuck.
[20:43.01]Oh, fuck.
[20:43.39]Oh, fuck.
[20:43.79]There's too many hot dogs.
[20:45.89]This is supposed to be a relaxing stream.
[20:50.88]Five.
[20:51.90]Hey, you want ketchup and mustard?
[20:52.88]Get out.
[20:53.86]Get the fuck out of my restaurant.
[20:56.90]What just happened?
[20:58.16]What just happened?
[20:58.92]They just deleted.
[21:00.33]Why did they delete?
[21:02.47]Why did they delete?
[21:04.19]What?
[21:11.80]What do you want?
[21:12.86]Open the ice basin and fill it.
[21:17.13]What?
[21:18.61]Alright, hurry up!
[21:21.07]What do you want?
[21:21.69]Pretzel bun, mustard... P... No!
[21:24.05]Z!
[21:24.89]Z and then M!
[21:27.09]Get out!
[21:29.19]Duh!
[21:29.82]You want pretzel bun, Z, and then ketchup and mustard.
[21:35.56]You want... Shift... Tab 4... No!
[21:40.12]Tab 3... Tab 3... 4.
[21:44.24]Tab 3... 4.
[21:46.26]I don't like this new... I don't like this one.
[21:48.44]Premium Bun... P... Onions... Why the fuck is it N onions?
[21:56.00]Why would you not make O onions?
[21:59.92]No.
[22:00.36]Shift... This is incorrect.
[22:04.86]Q... S...
[22:11.76]What?
[22:12.56]Am I deleting these?
[22:13.74]I am.
[22:14.24]Okay, so if you do it twice, you delete them.
[22:19.43]L, C, S. I need to... I'm going out of business.
[22:29.27]Pretzel.
[22:29.81]I need... Okay.
[22:31.58]Why is B pretzel?
[22:33.66]I'm going to remap this whole thing.
[22:37.33]Who's the insane person that decided that B was going to be pretzel and not P?
[22:42.87]Who's the insane person that said N was going to be onions and not O?
[22:53.23]Use a controller.
[22:54.95]Well, that's what I did last time.
[22:55.85]Wasn't it a disaster?
[22:56.67]Hold on.
[23:01.40]Just plug in.
[23:02.14]Really?
[23:02.40]Is it better?
[23:07.53]Relax.
[23:14.04]Do not use a controller.
[23:15.66]Oh god.
[23:16.76]I don't know what to think.
[23:20.76]Hold on.
[23:24.31]It's better, it's better, it's better.
[23:27.11]Hold on, let me... I just plugged it in.
[23:31.45]I might have to restart it.
[23:32.77]Yeah, I'm quitting.
[23:34.07]I quit.
[23:38.19]Why not?
[23:38.81]Let's go.
[23:39.13]There we go.
[23:43.88]Okay.
[23:45.76]Max Wieners.
[23:49.44]Let's try this.
[23:55.54]You used to learn the keyboard without looking at it.
[23:57.56]I can't.
[23:57.86]That's literally impossible.
[23:59.78]I've been using computers for 25 years and I don't know how to use the keys without looking at it.
[24:03.50]It's not going to happen.
[24:04.10]It's impossible.
[24:04.66]It'll never happen again.
[24:05.38]I'm sorry.
[24:08.15]This is a thousand times easier, by the way.
[24:10.91]Let's do pretzels.
[24:12.93]Wait to hold it.
[24:13.53]Okay.
[24:15.64]We want Jerma pretzel.
[24:18.30]Okay.
[24:18.64]Cook it up.
[24:20.88]How do I do the second tab?
[24:27.18]Okay.
[24:29.50]Wiener.
[24:35.69]Is it B or something?
[24:43.50]Alright, got pretzels ready.
[24:44.44]Alright, what do you want?
[24:46.28]Premium bun?
[24:46.98]You want a premium bun.
[24:49.36]And you want... That's it.
[24:50.28]Nothing else.
[24:50.66]Get out of here.
[24:52.28]Nobody want a corn dog.
[24:53.00]You don't want any corn dogs.
[24:54.02]You want everything on this.
[24:54.84]This is a premium bun.
[24:56.38]And then we got everything.
[24:58.08]We've got everything.
[25:00.69]Cheese, ketchup, onions.
[25:05.27]Get out.
[25:06.69]Nobody wants a pretzel yet.
[25:09.20]Oh, I have to... Okay, I get it.
[25:13.48]Anybody else want anything?
[25:14.28]How do I... Okay, you.
[25:15.48]Go.
[25:19.10]How do I select another station with the controller?
[25:22.05]You want everything.
[25:25.61]You want... No.
[25:26.77]You want queso, jalapeños, beans.
[25:35.15]How do I select a fucking station?
[25:36.66]Oh god, it's just right on the D-pad!
[25:39.32]Okay, let's do, uh, corndogs.
[25:48.78]Let's put a fucking bunch of them in there.
[25:51.18]Close it up, let's go.
[25:51.78]Alright, what do you want?
[25:54.38]Oh, this is bad.
[26:01.41]You want...
[26:04.27]pretzels.
[26:04.59]I got a few of them left, right?
[26:08.37]Alright, here we go.
[26:10.81]No, you want mustard on it.
[26:11.67]Mustard is X. What the fuck do you want?
[26:14.45]You want... Mustard is X. What do you want?
[26:17.98]You want... Mustard is X. What do you want?
[26:21.18]You want... Oh, fuck.
[26:22.30]Oh my god, they're burning!
[26:23.58]Okay, regular bun.
[26:25.86]And then everything else.
[26:27.38]Oh my god, this is so confusing.
[26:35.06]What did I do wrong?
[26:37.80]Hold F trigger and... What's wrong with this thing?
[26:49.91]Didn't I just do this?
[26:50.59]I think I'm gonna rage quit this game, by the way.
[27:03.61]I don't think I want to play this.
[27:07.39]This is so much more hectic than the first game.
[27:09.99]By, like, a thousand times.
[27:16.73]This isn't Cook to Serve Delicious 2, this is Cook Serve Delicious Harder.
[27:27.28]And then... No, no, no, no, no, I went the wrong button.
[27:38.26]No, you gotta prep the shit.
[27:39.52]It's just... I'm so not used to doing that.
[27:42.69]I... I don't like to hold and left trigger... Give me the fucking keyboard.
[27:49.17]No, that's not gonna work.
[27:52.67]Y. Okay, then left trigger Y. Left trigger Y, left trigger X. Holding, and then go, and... And a pretzel?
[28:06.54]Get rid of the rats.
[28:10.66]He's not relaxing.
[28:18.61]I've really not.
[28:20.77]What?
[28:21.05]What happened?
[28:27.41]Oh.
[28:29.53]Ketchup.
[28:32.79]What?
[28:33.21]What happened?
[28:34.47]I thought I had pretzels here.
[28:35.35]What the fuck?
[28:44.65]It's too much for me.
[28:47.25]Did I already have pre- do they have- are these ones Jerma?
[28:50.83]I don't know.
[28:51.37]Are they Jerma?
[28:52.09]Don't press Y again.
[31:08.57]Passive aggressive.
[31:14.57]That's not passive aggressive.
[31:16.09]Yeah, I can't.
[31:21.01]My brain sucks.
[31:22.35]I can't play this one.
[31:23.91]It's cool.
[31:24.45]I wish I could.
[31:25.35]I can't.
[31:25.95]I know I can't.
[31:26.74]I know I can't.
[31:27.22]You have to admit when you can't do something.
[31:30.58]You know what I mean?
[31:31.32]I'm admitting I can't do it.
[31:35.10]Do the casual mode?
[31:35.80]I don't know.
[31:36.26]I can't do it.
[31:36.86]I can't do it.
[31:37.60]I can't do it.
[31:54.41]You can do it.
[31:55.41]I can't do it.
[32:01.30]If you wanted to see Cook Serve Delicious 2, I was like, oh yeah, I can't wait.
[32:04.88]I just know I'm not going to like it.
[32:06.59]I'm certain of it.
[32:08.31]I like the first one.
[32:10.25]I can tell you.
[32:10.89]I guarantee I'm not going to like it.
[32:13.81]Even if I lower the difficulty, I'm just telling you.
