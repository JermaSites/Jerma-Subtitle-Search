[ve:61.1.100]

[00:21.60]Hey, what's up?
[00:23.22]When are you going to play Captain Crunch's Crunching Adventure?
[00:35.85]As soon as fucking humanly possible.
[00:40.12]As soon as humanly possible.
[00:42.04]Are you going to try...
[00:55.92]I have the disk for it.
[00:56.76]You have the disk for it?
[00:58.09]Oh my god.
[01:00.05]Might need to source that disk.
[01:05.01]Yeah, okay, so last night, here's the deal.
[01:09.63]Played Robocop for a long time.
[01:15.09]And didn't get to Chrono Trigger, so we're going to do Chrono Trigger all day.
[01:18.51]Maybe like six hours?
[01:22.39]Maybe five?
[01:24.70]Something like that.
[01:28.70]Let's get the pre-rolls out of the way or get the pre-rolls turned off.
[01:35.23]Let's see if ads start playing here in about 10 seconds.
[01:37.59]I'm going to continue to get ready.
[01:39.97]I'm going to make a T. And we are at Frog's Ark.
[01:47.47]Got that?
[01:50.06]Alright.
[01:50.98]Let's see if the ads start.
[01:51.80]Hopefully they do.
[01:57.47]I'm here for Frog.
[02:01.87]Frog's one of the best characters in the game.
[02:03.75]That's a good character to be here for.
[02:13.37]Yeah, Isla's going to be a permanent member of the team.
[02:16.07]Don't worry.
[02:18.19]I'm excited though.
[02:18.81]I want to play this.
[02:19.37]I'm into it.
[02:21.51]I love this game.
[02:23.71]And then I think tomorrow... Tomorrow is...
[02:28.69]bar any technical mishaps I think tomorrow Ster and I are gonna do the Dark Souls 3 fuck face stream with the uh with that mod the seamless co-op mod maybe randomizer it's gonna be a shit show so
[02:54.70]If for some reason there's technical problems, we'll figure it out.
[02:58.22]Move it to a different day, maybe.
[02:59.30]But tomorrow is the plan, so... I don't know exactly what time.
[03:11.78]What's this title?
[03:13.98]What's wrong with the title?
[03:17.47]It's...
[03:18.84]This is the Chrono... Okay, the original title was... It's the Chrono Triggerathon.
[03:24.38]One sub does nothing.
[03:27.26]Absolutely nothing.
[03:28.71]No time increases.
[03:29.81]And I was like, wait, I don't think I want people to think that, like, a sub is gonna do something, so I took it out.
[03:39.05]He's proud of his title.
[03:40.61]I'm very proud of that title.
[03:43.47]I spent a lot of time on it.
[03:46.09]I sat there and I giggled.
[03:47.57]I sat there and I was like, wait,
[03:50.24]Wait, what if I said that?
[03:54.40]If movie night happens, you better play the room.
[03:58.91]Is the room public domain?
[04:00.45]I don't think the room is public domain.
[04:01.73]You're going to play that new Sims clone.
[04:08.17]Oh yeah, in Inzoy, whatever it's called.
[04:14.37]I might check it out.
[04:15.25]It depends if it's any good, maybe.
[04:22.83]Brog's Ark is sick is terrible English.
[04:26.65]No, it's not.
[04:27.95]That's Brog's Ark is sick.
[04:31.90]You gotta read it with the right inflection.
[04:36.64]Berserkers are new soulslike.
[04:37.78]There's no apostrophe.
[04:51.55]You ever seen Junior?
[04:53.65]The movie Junior?
[04:54.63]I mean, maybe a long time ago.
[05:02.60]Now today is chrono.
[05:11.77]Tomorrow is going to be a big Dark Souls day.
[05:19.96]Oh, ads aren't even playing.
[05:20.90]Well, it says they are.
[05:21.88]It's okay.
[05:24.88]And then I want to do another Ichio Horror Night.
[05:30.95]Maybe this end of this weekend or something.
[05:33.05]There's going to be a period here over the next few days where I probably won't stream for a little bit.
[05:37.81]I'm probably not going to stream for maybe a few days in a row at some point here soon.
[05:47.68]Got some stuff to do.
[05:54.74]Retired again.
[05:55.52]A few days without streams.
[06:01.35]Oh, it's over.
[06:04.00]But, uh, there's gonna be some things on this channel.
[06:07.42]I'm looking forward to a new, uh, some new starting soon stuff.
[06:11.76]Talked about it yesterday, but I'm gonna try to get some work on that soon.
[06:15.75]Because I want there to be, like, something to do here while we, you know, get the ads out of the way and start up everything and get situated.
[06:25.33]I want there to be, like, just something interesting to look at or... And on the BRBs.
[06:30.19]Just, just something.
[06:33.83]It's not anything crazy.
[06:38.19]Will you finish Chrono tonight?
[06:40.77]I don't think... See you later.
[06:42.27]For those of you that aren't getting the ads.
[06:49.43]I probably won't finish it tonight.
[06:50.53]I have to imagine it's probably... I think I'm at the halfway point right now.
[07:05.61]So if I stream for another like maybe four to six hours tonight.
[07:10.70]I'll probably get pretty close.
[07:15.14]We'll see.
[07:15.44]I don't know.
[07:15.82]I'm just down for whatever.
[07:19.66]It's what I do.
[07:24.70]jacket games like marbles while you're gone yeah the idea is that during some of these ad breaks and some of the starting soon stuff because it'll take about five to ten minutes to get the stream started that there'll be something to do that's what I wanted to do some channel point stuff with still working on that still trying to figure out how I can get that to work uh I have had to talk to Twitch about this the thing I want to do I need to like tweak it a little because it's
[07:51.40]I guess classified as technically gambling.
[07:58.70]So I need to make sure I either tweak it enough where it's not or I don't know.
[08:04.71]It's been... I've had to go back and forth a few times.
[08:19.71]Yeah, guys, I've gotten a few different comments from Twitch about it, and I have no idea.
[08:29.65]But I would have to classify all of my streams going forward if I did this thing as this is a casino stream now.
[08:39.59]And I'm just like, I don't really want to do that.
[08:42.44]I don't think I want to do that.
[08:46.12]So it is what it is.
[08:47.82]I'll have to figure it out.
[08:58.26]That's bad?
[08:59.46]Yeah, well, it's just, it kind of puts you in like the 18 plus category and like real money casino category, which I don't really want to be in 24-7.
[09:10.45]I don't really want to be, have my channel in there 24-7.
[09:18.58]Nice planets.
[09:19.16]Hey, thanks.
[09:19.64]Appreciate it.
[09:27.50]You're already 18 plus with that potty mouth.
[09:31.26]Yeah, but there's a difference between being a potty mouth and saying there is real money casino gambling happening right now, all day, every day on this stream.
[09:43.70]I think there's a difference.
[09:52.57]And I guess Twitch is classifying the thing that I want to do as that.
[09:57.43]So I need to figure out how to kind of change it to make it a little different.
[10:03.05]But I'm working on it.
[10:04.59]I'm working on it.
[10:05.35]Hey, every time I go and ask you about playing Sly Cooper or what you think about it, you start reading a different comment.
[10:14.00]Uh... Win big.
[10:15.96]Wait, what?
[10:16.52]Win big?
[10:18.26]What did I win?
[10:21.11]Uh, you could do a pachinko machine.
[10:22.23]Yeah, maybe that's possible.
[10:28.74]There's a lot of things you could actually do.
[10:31.98]But I need to make sure it makes sense.
[10:33.80]Because I want it to be fun and I want to be cool.
[10:42.91]Alright, you guys ready?
[10:43.47]I think we're good.
[10:50.43]The bingo rollerball.
[10:53.74]Oh, yeah.
[10:54.66]No, there's plenty of things to do.
[10:57.94]Alright, where we left off, let's come back over here.
[11:01.94]Thanks for hanging out today.
[11:03.30]Okay.
[11:03.92]Thanks for spending some time here.
[11:05.46]Okay.
[11:08.38]Okay.
[11:10.86]Maybe we will beat Chrono today.
[11:12.16]It's possible.
[11:15.63]All things are on the table, potentially.
[11:19.17]Let's get that volume up.
[11:20.07]Come on, man.
[11:22.39]Zero chance.
[11:28.25]I doubt we do, but that, I mean, we're, I want to just play.
[11:38.56]I was trying to play Chrono today and it bricked my laptop.
[11:43.14]Bro.
[11:45.82]You good?
[11:49.64]Bro, you good?
[11:50.22]Alright, let's do it.
[11:55.15]This is where you fight the Fiend Lord.
[11:57.69]Is already in here, but I want to save it.
[12:03.65]I like this crew like the group were good.
[12:05.66]He he.
[12:17.21]Robo, don't waste your energy.
[12:21.67]I'm only going to disassemble you anyway.
[12:27.18]Did I get... The last thing I did, did I get any items?
[12:29.74]I don't know if I got items.
[12:39.54]Super Sonic Spin.
[12:50.34]Two, three.
[12:52.83]Oh, only three.
[12:57.17]Sound effects are kind of loud.
[12:58.11]Turn him down.
[13:06.91]It's the tinnitus castle.
[13:12.04]One guy.
[13:16.35]Big Crip by Frog.
[13:17.35]He's in the title.
[13:18.09]He's even in the title of the stream.
[13:20.27]Let's go.
[13:24.21]Let's go!
[13:26.11]Oh, I'm so... I'm ready.
[13:29.03]Wait.
[13:40.64]I actually don't have very much stuff.
[13:45.12]Uh, I have...
[13:47.62]I have ethers, though.
[13:48.42]I think I'll be alright.
[13:52.11]Frog, you're safe.
[13:56.81]That will not do at all.
[13:58.07]Uh, can we get a robo spin, please?
[14:12.57]Heal?
[14:14.33]What?
[14:18.88]You gonna play The Sims 2?
[14:21.10]Maybe someday.
[14:22.74]Oops.
[14:34.27]What?
[14:36.47]Absorb magic damage or something?
[14:46.18]That'll do it.
[14:49.44]Don't heal the enemy.
[14:53.86]Just trying to get shit done.
[15:06.33]Chronos, this is where you've been hiding since the fair.
[15:10.36]You had me worried.
[15:14.76]It's what he does.
[15:15.48]You've been very naughty.
[15:16.48]I think you'll have to die.
[15:17.44]I'm going to cyclone up here.
[15:38.46]Let's kill everybody.
[15:39.26]Maybe.
[15:50.79]What are the baby noises?
[15:57.25]Who's hearing baby noises?
[16:12.12]I need potions bad, actually.
[16:16.13]I might have to leave and go buy some.
[16:20.47]First boss?
[16:26.07]The magician Flea, I presume?
[16:27.85]Steel's empty.
[16:42.06]How come my stream titles are so short?
[16:45.06]That's a long title.
[16:47.02]That was not Flea.
[16:48.08]Where's the true one?
[16:50.58]Hee hee hee, I am here, right here!
[16:52.30]And the bat the whole time.
[16:55.78]Did you guys even think that was gonna happen?
[16:57.18]Did you see that?
[17:02.12]Greetings, little green one.
[17:04.72]Who is this person?
[17:08.17]Ah, she is a powerful magician.
[17:09.61]Do not lower your guard.
[17:10.91]Flea is not the mere woman she seems.
[17:14.55]Yes, yes, I'm a man after all, right?
[17:16.45]Pout.
[17:18.83]But his exterior is clearly that of a female.
[17:21.67]Tee hee hee, man or woman, it's all the same.
[17:23.53]Power is beauty, and I'm deliciously strong.
[17:26.07]Poor little froggy, you must be lonely now that Cyrus is gone.
[17:30.30]And if he turned into something so hideous, how dreadful.
[17:36.24]Since you've brought your new friends over to play... Let me show... uh oh.
[17:40.79]Actually, I need to heal.
[17:41.71]Am I gonna be able to do this?
[17:49.50]I need MP.
[17:53.34]Uh, mid-ether?
[17:57.07]Shit, actually, everybody needs it.
[18:04.21]I wasn't ready.
[18:09.79]Wind Waltz.
[18:15.52]Uh, that's not good.
[18:16.16]Hold on.
[18:18.51]Uh, where is it?
[18:19.15]This one.
[18:21.45]Alright, now let's do it.
[18:24.91]Uh, how about sword scream?
[18:34.16]Oh shit, he's asleep.
[18:37.56]Uh, let's do cyclone sweep.
[18:39.12]Nope, supersonic spin.
[18:47.29]That was only 100 damage.
[18:49.75]Do the robo spin off camera please.
[19:10.43]Good.
[19:11.41]Damn.
[19:12.97]That hurt a lot.
[19:18.70]Oh, triple attack.
[19:19.60]Watch this.
[19:23.01]Thousand.
[19:24.33]Oof.
[19:25.53]Uh-oh.
[19:31.73]Uh, did it blind anybody?
[19:32.63]Let's do triple attack again.
[19:45.44]Oh.
[19:52.11]Oh shit, he's freaking out.
[19:56.58]Cure that.
[19:57.20]Alright, now do it.
[20:10.55]Chrono Laugh is literally XD.
[20:13.32]It does kind of look like that, doesn't it?
[20:21.27]Look, please, magic.
[20:25.64]Yeah, that hurt.
[20:29.22]Good.
[20:30.26]See if I can end it right here.
[20:33.54]That's it.
[20:34.94]That's gotta be it.
[20:36.85]That's not it.
[20:39.45]I got way too confident.
[20:50.28]I have to leave and get potions too, I think.
[20:56.91]Damn it.
[21:02.52]He's fine.
[21:03.12]No, he's not.
[21:20.64]Uh, don't die.
[21:21.80]Shit.
[21:32.04]Don't die.
[21:34.16]The effects are crazy.
[21:35.44]I love these old effects.
[21:36.40]I love the sounds, too.
[21:37.90]Everything sounds so cool.
[21:43.26]You're gonna get a Switch, too?
[21:46.82]I don't know.
[21:47.42]Maybe.
[21:47.76]I don't know.
[21:49.23]What would I play on it?
[22:01.09]What's your favorite sound effect from the game?
[22:03.76]It's probably the one that goes... You know the one.
[22:12.28]It's like...
[22:23.87]Oh, this is actually really bad.
[22:28.39]This is very bad.
[22:29.71]Uh, Robo's dead.
[22:40.88]This is harder than I thought it was gonna be.
[22:42.52]Uh, I have to end it right now.
[22:50.74]I'm going for it.
[22:51.34]I don't care if it's a mistake.
[22:54.06]Do it!
[22:58.84]700 damage.
[22:59.32]Yes!
[22:59.78]We're good.
[23:03.50]Thank goodness.
[23:07.43]But I'm so beautiful, Lord Magus.
[23:15.69]We did it.
[23:18.05]Magic capsule.
[23:26.09]That was actually kind of tricky.
[23:28.29]Um... I need items bad.
[23:32.94]Like, really bad.
[23:44.62]But maybe I can just do this one more thing. ...
[23:59.09]Yes, I want your treasure.
[24:01.63]Hey, but first play with us, please.
[24:06.57]Magic, right?
[24:12.75]Laser.
[24:23.30]That's a quad.
[24:25.54]Quad.
[24:28.93]Yeah, I laughed in the shower this morning, um, over RoboCop, by the way.
[24:35.71]I thought of the computer just getting thrown over that person's head.
[24:46.00]Oh, shit.
[24:47.20]I have to go all the way back.
[24:50.42]That's not too far, right?
[24:54.86]I have to, okay, avoid everything if I can, because I don't want to aggro anything.
[25:08.24]there we go okay market I need to buy a bunch of shit I got so much money I'll buy 20 of these I'll buy like 50 of these
[25:37.80]have a massive supply of these uh it's good to have these good to have a few of these good to have a couple of these now I'm happy did I just get a uh what did I just get bronze helm no way there's so much better that I can give him
[26:09.32]what about the hero's badge boost critical hit rate of the massive moon okay I put that on silver earring is kind of insane he's doing retail therapy where's the most HP power glove maybe
[26:38.84]Get some gear at the dino times?
[26:40.20]That's actually not a bad idea.
[26:48.85]If I have any trouble, I'll go back and get it.
[26:54.49]That crit bonus is insane.
[27:04.86]Yeah, if it causes me any more issues, then I'll just go get some better stuff.
[27:11.81]We're gonna get a Bloodborne 10th Anniversary stream?
[27:15.50]I'll consider it.
[27:17.30]I would consider it.
[27:19.70]Yeah, it's been 10 years.
[27:23.18]That's an insane thought.
[27:24.34]10 years.
[27:41.54]Oh my god, just kill it.
[27:42.52]14?
[27:44.96]What about Night Rain?
[28:01.53]Yeah, Night Rain for sure.
[28:04.37]What the fuck?
[28:12.10]This is the hardest minigame.
[28:14.89]There's nothing I can do.
[28:18.41]Isn't it going to take so long for them to all do it?
[28:22.85]What the fuck?
[28:24.43]Stop it!
[28:35.02]There we go.
[28:38.06]Boom!
[28:39.28]Boom!
[28:47.85]Damn it, I have to do this all over again.
[28:56.11]Okay.
[29:02.89]Now let's go.
[29:17.88]kick his ass no wait everybody relax I do have a boss down alright so I went to the right side so let's go left side
[29:54.93]should have sang it
[30:29.00]Big crit.
[30:40.69]Oh, that's right.
[30:41.11]Laser is shadow.
[30:42.75]Let's do normal.
[30:50.32]Regular, normal punches.
[31:07.25]How much more game is there?
[31:08.19]Yeah, it's about half left.
[31:11.77]I'd say after I do this castle, I think I'm exactly at the halfway point of the game, I think.
[31:22.36]Please help us escape from this eternal suffering.
[31:33.43]Cyclops.
[31:43.95]Who's cooler, Robo or Robocop?
[31:48.81]That's not fair.
[31:50.25]That's actually not fair.
[31:52.77]They're both cool.
[31:54.33]They're both sick.
[32:00.40]In different ways.
[32:02.74]How would a name like Slash...
[32:29.53]that's a that's a pretty crazy name I think that just means you just you just slash people yeah the guy that just like cuts people up just give him a name about cutting things up I must admit I've not I've not even dreamed you would find the courage to come here cyrus not been with you last time your fate would have been the same as all the others but I'm sure you'd have a fit right in with those skeletal servants of mine
[33:01.01]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[33:03.30]What are you doing?
[33:06.26]What?
[33:13.88]880 damage.
[33:15.99]Just do that, like, five times.
[33:20.01]That's why I love these three together, because this move is so ridiculous.
[33:25.95]Alright, let's hold back on it now.
[33:32.19]What about lightning?
[33:33.95]It's alright.
[33:35.41]880?
[33:35.53]Oh, that's good.
[33:37.67]Trigger.
[33:43.43]I was thinking of the guy last night.
[34:08.25]Alright, heal around.
[34:09.55]You have to play Indiana Jones.
[34:34.18]Alright, I will play Indiana Jones for one hour.
[34:39.34]It'll be one full hour.
[34:40.70]I need to start getting, like, nutrient paste.
[34:55.95]And I need to, like, get my medical problem fixed so I can fucking scream, like, all day.
[35:15.04]It's good to have something restraining you from tapping into your full potential.
[35:48.37]What about water?
[35:49.03]I didn't even see how much damage it did.
[35:52.18]It was zero?
[35:59.50]Oof.
[36:02.47]Let's get a triple.
[36:08.19]Tank it.
[36:08.55]Doesn't matter.
[36:09.83]Dead.
[36:10.89]Dead.
[36:12.55]Dead.
[36:14.46]Do it again.
[36:15.38]Doesn't matter.
[36:16.62]Do it again.
[36:20.16]And... Come on, Robo.
[36:24.27]And... Dead, dead!
[36:29.59]Do it again.
[36:30.49]I don't care.
[36:34.50]Do it again.
[36:35.82]And... Dead, dead!
[36:38.06]Uh-oh.
[36:42.92]That's bad.
[36:45.35]Ooh!
[36:47.37]Ooh!
[36:47.55]Ooh!
[36:49.38]I got way too confident.
[36:54.34]I got way too confident.
[36:58.62]I need a potion.
[37:01.22]Give it to... I don't know.
[37:02.86]Damn, he's got a lot of health.
[37:13.36]How much health does he have?
[37:19.84]Yeah, dead!
[37:22.16]That's gotta be it.
[37:25.30]Oh my god.
[37:26.22]Good, that's fine.
[37:28.50]Is that fine?
[37:31.74]It's not fine.
[37:37.24]This is not fine.
[37:51.07]This is not fine.
[37:56.79]No!
[38:03.24]Kill him!
[38:04.86]Yes!
[38:05.58]Oh, that's not a yes.
[38:10.80]Oh my god, he's kicking the shit out of me.
[38:13.83]I didn't take this seriously and he's kicking the shit out of me.
[38:16.01]Uh, I have to heal.
[38:26.34]Come on Frog, you have to stay alive.
[38:28.66]Heal Chrono.
[38:30.00]And then Chrono needs to heal himself.
[38:32.44]And then we need a group heal.
[38:45.17]Okay, it's alright.
[38:47.13]Get Robo up.
[38:52.07]And then potion on Robo.
[38:55.32]Now we triple tech kill him.
[39:01.52]Triple tech.
[39:04.47]Who doesn't have fucking mana?
[39:05.53]Somebody doesn't have mana.
[39:06.73]Start.
[39:12.70]Hey, crisis averted.
[39:13.54]Let's go.
[39:23.27]Save point, for real?
[39:25.53]That was actually the slasher, cool.
[39:54.34]That was probably the hardest one, like the actual, besides the dinosaur one.
[39:59.15]Okay, frog needs to level up.
[40:04.09]He's only level 18.
[40:06.41]Alright, so that's two down.
[40:15.53]Time to stretch and drink some water.
[40:19.81]Not for a little while.
[40:21.55]Still like about 20, 30 minutes.
[40:24.53]Long time VOD watcher, first time streamer.
[40:28.85]Hey, what's up?
[40:30.21]You're actually right.
[40:30.87]This is the first time chatting.
[40:37.96]How you doing?
[40:38.42]Welcome.
[40:45.19]Oh, it's a fake one.
[40:52.96]Yeah, I just want to play the bass on this song, don't you?
[40:55.55]Don't you just want to just sit there and just on the bass?
[41:10.22]I just imagine doing the thing where you're kind of like rocking back and forth, looking side to side really fast, opening your mouth a little bit, going like, while you slap, slap, slap.
[41:27.13]And you're in that base stance.
[41:32.89]It's a really wide stance and you're looking side to side.
[41:35.58]I'll do it on camera tomorrow.
[41:46.24]Oh, just kill them.
[41:47.26]Stack is fine.
[42:01.77]You're gonna turn the cam on just to do a base stance?
[42:03.81]No, I'm gonna show you what I'm talking about.
[42:05.37]Yeah, I'll just get a fake guitar and I'll just show you.
[42:35.58]Are you afraid of disappearing one day because you haven't been on camera for so long?
[42:40.15]I was on camera last week.
[42:43.73]We did the horror night.
[42:44.59]I was on camera.
[42:49.43]Just not going to happen every time now.
[42:50.98]It's going to be a special occasion.
[43:07.30]Hey, honestly, you've been streaming a little too much, buddy.
[43:09.14]You're going to need you to tone it down.
[43:15.08]I'm just, hey, I'm just broadcasting.
[43:28.23]Heel.
[43:38.53]Alright, this is not a laser spin.
[43:40.00]I wish I had some more... ...melee moves.
[43:46.00]I can't hit you with this melee?
[43:49.10]Talking about.
[43:59.08]Wind Slash is magic?
[44:02.00]No, it is not.
[44:15.53]Annihilation Zone.
[44:20.47]I feel like this is one of those songs you learn if you're a big fan of this game.
[44:31.56]This is the kind of song that you learn first on bass.
[44:36.16]Like, you know what, man?
[44:36.94]I'm going to learn bass.
[44:38.08]I'm going to learn that Chrono Trigger battle theme.
[44:41.93]I feel like it's only a couple notes, right?
[44:45.87]And you sit there and you... And when you finally get it, you go like... And you just keep doing it over and over again until you get it.
[44:59.18]This is a noob trap.
[45:05.36]What do you mean it's a noob trap?
[45:08.20]Doon doon doon.
[45:09.25]Doon doon doon doon doon doon doon.
[45:11.41]Doon doon doon doon doon doon doon.
[45:13.63]Doon doon doon doon doon doon.
[45:21.29]mist robe.
[45:22.85]Noob trap.
[45:27.21]Defense 54?
[45:27.73]That's insane!
[45:31.69]Is that not insane?
[45:34.83]That's more defense than
[45:53.64]Speed and attack.
[45:56.90]Ah, I lose the magic, but who cares?
[45:58.44]It's much better.
[46:00.24]Slasher.
[46:05.25]Is it time to take the power glove off?
[46:07.81]Or will somebody freak out if I do that?
[46:09.77]Maybe more speed.
[46:12.79]Do I give Karnal the headband?
[46:17.47]I'm not losing that much damage.
[46:19.99]Only 2 damage?
[46:30.99]Someone just asked, when was the last time you had barbecue?
[46:33.29]And I read it as burlesque.
[46:35.41]Anyway, when was the last time you saw burlesque?
[46:39.94]Uh, last time that I had barbecue.
[46:41.14]I'm going to keep this.
[46:46.39]I'm doing speed.
[46:48.01]Yeah.
[46:49.67]I want to be fast.
[46:52.71]Uh, let's heal.
[47:04.44]That looks good.
[47:04.84]Because we're fighting this guy now.
[47:06.42]Alright, don't die.
[47:12.24]So you've made it.
[47:14.29]Flash!
[47:15.83]Flee!
[47:18.53]Pardon, Ozzy.
[47:19.19]They cannot help you anymore.
[47:21.57]You fly-eating, tongue-flicking... Oz... Ozzy's in a pickle.
[47:28.88]Will not escape us.
[47:35.60]Actually, it sends fortress.
[47:40.72]You guys want to rage Dark Souls?
[47:42.31]Dude, I should play Dark Souls more to get enraged.
[47:53.73]Drop it.
[47:59.23]Dark Mail.
[48:05.74]Oh, damn.
[48:06.46]Alright, who should have that?
[48:10.26]Robo.
[48:13.26]Yeah, let's have Robo be super defense.
[48:20.02]Give the titanium vest frog.
[48:25.76]You beat Dark Souls, right?
[48:26.89]Yeah, on stream.
[48:29.59]It's an important distinction.
[48:31.91]Man, not bad.
[48:32.57]How's this?
[48:48.73]Ah, I get it.
[48:49.17]Get it.
[48:53.44]What?
[48:53.72]Impossible.
[48:59.67]Deathclaw.
[49:03.03]Deathclaw, Deathclaw.
[49:04.11]Oh, it's a robo.
[49:11.74]Oh, he learned Heal.
[49:49.64]I love that show.
[49:57.08]I've seen that show a million times.
[50:12.13]Kill it with magic.
[50:25.08]Would you even perform your mouth music live?
[50:29.36]No.
[50:31.00]Although there's been... There's things that I think would be funny to do.
[50:36.95]I can't jump over it.
[50:37.73]It's not like Donkey Kong. ...
[50:54.71]just made my night first it was base now it's death clock did you just say I'm sweating wait why he's sweating watch out no I forgot what the heck
[51:33.85]That was me yesterday when he was mentioning birds.
[51:36.73]There's a lot of cool birds.
[51:51.40]Lapis.
[51:56.28]Mid-Ether.
[51:59.54]Actually, can I do a shelter here?
[52:05.61]I'm glad I did that for no reason.
[52:06.73]Nice job.
[52:14.44]How many lizards can you name?
[52:15.54]Uh, the blood.
[52:19.38]The eye blood shooting horned lizard.
[52:26.08]No!
[52:28.27]Drop me again.
[52:30.81]Drop me again.
[52:38.45]Good.
[52:41.47]Barrier spear.
[52:47.14]Barrier spear?
[52:55.59]That's huge.
[52:56.15]200 HP to all members?
[53:08.12]Where's Barrier Spear?
[53:09.40]Oh, there it is.
[53:11.96]Ah, cool.
[53:12.38]I already have eight unused capsules because I get the rocket launcher and I have two shots with the rocket launcher and I get it a third of the way through the game.
[53:26.65]And then I shoot the final boss with the rocket launcher and miss both shots.
[53:32.01]That's why.
[53:40.46]fight these six damage this is not Resident Evil same philosophy though I just don't know I hate using them because I know my theory and this I'm changing this theory is I don't know when I'm gonna use it and I it's a very powerful thing and I don't know the best place to use it so I don't ever use it
[54:08.19]I'm changing that philosophy though.
[54:10.17]Did you do that same joke two years ago?
[54:11.47]And it hit just as hard.
[54:14.70]Shit.
[54:23.82]We're using assets?
[54:37.45]Hey, but I'm the same engine.
[54:46.20]Those assets are in this engine.
[54:48.98]And they can be used whenever they need to be.
[54:58.55]Ah, shit.
[54:58.87]I thought it was right side.
[55:03.05]Nice.
[55:03.37]First try.
[55:08.88]Oh my god.
[55:09.60]I'm so good at picking it the first try.
[55:21.13]Oh, come on.
[55:23.83]First try again, watch this.
[55:29.37]Mm-mm-mm.
[55:30.07]Mm-mm-mm.
[55:40.32]People are complaining about used assets on an SNES?
[55:43.74]I think they're talking about my assets.
[55:49.95]It sounds weird to say that.
[55:51.79]Keelbeam.
[56:07.70]Oh no!
[56:09.18]But impossible!
[56:17.58]Can I avoid you?
[56:19.50]No.
[56:30.46]Oh my god, they're just exploding!
[56:52.04]Strike him with lightning.
[57:01.27]Oh, yeah.
[57:04.15]Oh, just do it again, whatever.
[57:24.93]Did you play Chrono Trigger?
[57:26.85]Heard that game's kind of good.
[57:37.48]What am I swinging at?
[57:39.58]Did I just attack myself?
[57:42.62]No, wait, alright.
[57:54.72]What are games like Chrono Trigger?
[57:58.68]Final Fantasy... Final Fantasy VI.
[58:01.88]Final Fantasy V. Final Fantasy VII.
[58:09.83]Final Fantasy... The Crystal Series.
[58:16.99]Dragon Quest.
[58:27.29]Call of Duty?
[58:27.87]Imagine Call of Duty made a turn-based game.
[58:36.19]That'd be so crazy.
[58:41.53]You are exploding down there.
[58:43.05]Why would you hit me up here?
[58:46.62]Bad programming.
[58:48.04]Bad code.
[58:49.88]The code is just like, it just doesn't hold up these days.
[58:52.88]You know what I mean?
[58:53.66]Just bad code.
[59:08.49]This game actually is one of the cleanest games, probably, that came out in the era.
[59:20.32]This game is clean.
[59:38.88]That just did way more damage than I thought that was going to do.
[59:43.19]764?
[59:59.64]I like Capcom.
[60:00.40]Don't say that about Capcom.
[60:11.59]Coming up on the first break.
[60:29.58]Get up and move around this.
[60:30.84]This is going to be a like 3 minutes.
[60:40.77]Break time.
[60:42.69]You literally hate Capcom.
[60:44.17]I love the Resident Evil games.
[60:45.53]It's some of my favorite games ever.
[60:51.53]Come on, everybody stand up.
[60:53.79]Everybody stand up.
[60:55.09]Come on and put your hands up.
[60:56.66]Come on and stand up.
[60:58.22]Everybody just stand up.
[61:03.40]I forgot about that.
[61:09.27]You're a big Capcom hater?
[61:10.49]I am not a Capcom hater.
[61:12.02]I just hated one thing that they did.
[61:16.66]And I don't know, I was having a bad day that day.
[61:19.20]I don't know.
[61:19.56]Sometimes you wake up on the wrong side of the bed and you just... you just like got annoyed.
[61:30.75]Put on some other music too.
[61:34.33]As you're going to start in about 15 seconds or so, get up.
[61:37.16]I'll be back.
[61:40.39]You need to move around.
[61:42.03]You're back.
[62:10.93]You played the game for two seconds and screamed, fuck Capcom.
[62:14.07]I think you were still on the menu.
[62:17.84]Yeah, well, before I get cut off, I was doing the video settings.
[62:21.56]I was going through and changing some stuff and getting it to capture better and it was locked at like 70 or 80 FOV and I was so mad about it.
[62:29.48]I was mad about it.
[62:32.78]I liked doing 90 FOV.
[62:36.71]It was the FOV, yeah.
[62:38.69]I was doing my video settings.
[62:42.07]and it got me very upset.
[66:22.53]What's that?
[66:22.91]How'd you like that fade?
[66:24.82]You like that manual fade?
[66:32.22]OK, what was that?
[66:34.00]What's going on here?
[66:34.64]What am I doing?
[66:40.29]That was a nice juicy fade, it was.
[66:46.23]Oh man, I got a sandwich.
[66:49.30]Who cares?
[66:49.84]Let's go.
[66:51.38]I don't have it right now, but I will.
[66:53.48]I need a heal.
[67:01.80]This game is way too hard.
[67:03.16]I think the tuning is a little off.
[67:09.57]Wait, Robo has a group heal.
[67:16.79]Wow.
[67:19.01]Oh, and it is scrumdiddlyumptious.
[67:23.39]That is a scrumdiddlyumptious heal, it's so good.
[67:38.79]You underestimate our unhealthy interest in every detail about your life.
[67:49.02]Go take a bath.
[68:03.07]Favorite color?
[68:05.69]What's my favorite color?
[68:10.80]It varies.
[68:14.28]My favorite color for real?
[68:15.64]Okay, if I want to lie... Frog Launcher?
[68:24.73]Ah, cool.
[68:27.05]My favorite color is probably... I would say it's blue.
[68:32.37]But it's not.
[68:35.11]It's usually, I would say, teal, but that's not even accurate either.
[68:40.43]My favorite color is probably red.
[68:45.60]Like a deep, bright, vibrant red.
[68:51.06]Especially with HDR.
[69:10.42]Deep and vibrant.
[69:11.30]Yes.
[69:15.41]Red HDR 4K VR.
[69:18.85]Yeah.
[69:20.83]What's your favorite primate?
[69:22.23]Orangutan.
[69:25.94]Or probably chimpanzee.
[69:28.44]They're just so funny.
[69:31.72]You know what?
[69:32.46]I want to make a video game one day.
[69:35.46]And it's just going to be called like Orangutan.
[69:37.88]Orangutan.
[69:42.34]And it's just like, you're just an orangutan in the jungle.
[69:45.42]And it's like a Dark Souls game.
[69:47.07]Like, fuck me.
[69:48.65]Fuck you, I want that game.
[69:51.09]I want to fucking play an orangutan in the jungle Dark Souls game.
[70:05.93]Orangutans are peaceful, though.
[70:07.95]Exactly, so it could be about...
[70:10.86]I don't know.
[70:11.54]I wanted to put, like, animals.
[70:14.14]Or, like, a bunch of chimpanzees or something.
[70:17.65]They made that game a long time ago.
[70:19.29]This is back, like, four or five years ago.
[70:22.27]It was called, like, Humanity.
[70:24.57]And you played as, like, early humans, kind of like apes.
[70:28.51]No, that's not what I wanted.
[70:30.85]I just want it to play as, like, a screaming chimpanzee.
[70:34.59]And, like, grow rocks and stuff.
[70:36.87]And... why do we not get that?
[70:40.71]What was it called?
[70:41.49]Ancestors.
[70:43.93]Not humanity.
[70:47.35]Do you know what I'm saying, though?
[70:58.50]Oh, these things at the bottom.
[71:05.87]You would love pets, monkeys on the DS.
[71:08.53]Really?
[71:23.98]I think we're severely being... we're being... a disservice is being done to the gaming community.
[71:30.48]by not having a... like a four-person co-op chimpanzee game where you just have to like survive out there.
[71:41.32]And there's like lions and fucking rhinos and tigers and monsters and shit.
[71:46.96]It's like the four of you just gotta live.
[71:52.48]And the graphics are good.
[71:53.56]It's kind of got good graphics.
[72:05.70]There's a Mario Party chimpanzee game.
[72:07.63]I don't want to play the Mario Party one.
[72:10.07]I want to play the one where there's permadeath.
[72:22.80]Just get Left 4 Dead 2 with mods?
[72:26.90]No, it has to be built from the ground up on Unreal 5.
[72:36.54]You missed the Tekken Season 2 Dev Talk yesterday.
[72:38.72]What'd they do?
[72:39.16]Anything new?
[72:40.40]Uh-oh, you got nothing else, do you?
[72:49.29]What's in the box?
[72:55.10]Speed Belt.
[72:57.58]um that's pretty good it's maximum speed guys that means maxed out speed the double star means maxed out frog is slow
[73:25.63]Yeah, I played it already.
[73:28.23]The game fucking took too long.
[73:32.54]It took too long.
[73:33.66]I don't want to be a person.
[73:35.42]I don't want to be half like an ape.
[73:38.54]No, I just want to be a chimpanzee.
[73:45.24]I don't want to make sticks.
[73:46.50]I don't want to make fire.
[73:47.68]I don't want to communicate.
[73:49.82]No, I just want to have a button that's on the controller that's like cycles through like five to ten different chimpanzee screams.
[73:58.76]And there is no voice chat.
[74:01.34]There is one or two emotes.
[74:03.20]There's a point.
[74:05.04]There's a arms in the air scared and like a happy.
[74:10.87]No voice chat.
[74:12.19]And you play with three or four people and you have to just fucking live.
[74:15.16]I think we're good.
[74:28.05]Oh, let me heal.
[74:40.66]Wait, it might actually be.
[74:46.90]You could do that in Toontown.
[74:48.36]No, not the thing I'm describing.
[74:49.68]You could probably do a Gmod RP server.
[74:58.67]With Kryken and Charborg.
[75:00.07]Okay.
[75:06.95]one day I will open up the notebook and I will just like try to find people to do these things like hey I have this idea for this thing I want to do it um and I want the the chimpanzees to have like punches and this should be friendly fire
[75:35.09]And I want like the main avenue of fighting to be punch, single left or right handed punch.
[75:41.22]It's left bumper or right bumper.
[75:43.50]And then you can pick up various rocks.
[75:46.66]There's like big fucking rocks you can pick up and just throw at stuff and you can hit your own friends in the head with them.
[76:02.47]Roblox does that?
[76:05.63]It does?
[76:21.40]I'm so glad you're just the idea guy.
[76:24.26]You, are you trying to tell me that a fleshed out... You, that would be the biggest fucking game on Steam for like two months.
[76:34.57]You just don't see the vision and that's fine.
[76:36.95]That's alright.
[76:37.41]You just don't see the vision.
[76:39.87]You'll, you'll download it like a few months later when all your friends are playing it.
[76:46.15]Hey, did you get this?
[76:47.01]Dude, this game just came out on Steam.
[76:48.27]What the fuck?
[76:48.75]Did you see this?
[76:50.43]Yeah, it's called...
[76:55.43]Chimpanzee Odyssey.
[77:00.91]And it's fucking crazy, dude!
[77:03.37]And then you're gonna get FOMO and you're gonna play with your friends and you're gonna be mad that you even thought this was a bad idea in the first place.
[77:18.29]You stole that.
[77:19.27]That's already... Ancestors.
[77:20.96]The Humankind Odyssey?
[77:25.70]name it humanity did I steal it no you don't see the vision one day I'll one day I'm just gonna release something and you guys gonna be like oh
[77:57.64]Gorilla Tag is the top VR game for years now.
[78:01.64]But I'm wrong, right?
[78:03.36]I know you didn't say that, but that's a bad idea, right?
[78:17.15]You gotta see the vision.
[78:19.45]Once you see the vision, you'll understand.
[78:28.10]The second that you see one of your friends try to carry a rock up a tree, and drop it and accidentally crush your other friend's head that was standing underneath him that he wasn't even- didn't even know was there... There's your positive review you're gonna write me on Steam.
[79:06.59]I was thinking of a bong-related roguelike where different strains and different kinds of bongs give you powers.
[79:21.98]What?
[79:22.30]You're gonna +2 that guy?
[79:30.07]You want that game?
[79:31.11]The bong roguelike you think is a better idea than... Apes.
[79:39.32]A frontier to never forget.
[79:41.68]I would play Smoke the Spire, yes.
[79:52.86]Are you sure you don't want to play... The Chimpanzee?
[80:00.22]chronicles get out of here oh if you make this and you make like 100 million dollars like you I you need to get in contact with me magic scarf
[80:30.21]I got two of these.
[80:39.64]We'll have a reaction time minigame of picking lice out of the other... Yeah, and eating them.
[80:51.50]See, you get it.
[80:52.44]You get it.
[80:53.02]And now you see the vision.
[80:56.06]Took you a little while, but you get it.
[81:01.63]Oh fuck, I'm out of ether.
[81:03.50]I got 12.
[81:05.82]I think I'm alright.
[81:26.26]Will there be any poop throwing?
[81:28.62]No.
[81:29.88]Because that will give us an M rating and I don't want that.
[81:41.10]That's no sale then?
[81:42.44]That's a refund.
[81:46.64]Okay, I guess, but then it would be an M rating and we would have to seriously negotiate our terms then.
[82:03.70]you have to bring that to the whiteboard I'm a whiteboard guy I get up there and I just start drawing shit I start writing things and start I got a notebook I've got I got a notebook with like fucking 100 page shit in it and I bring it on the whiteboard you have to bring that to the whiteboard
[82:32.16]Also, your time is nigh.
[82:46.21]Dude, hey, Polly and I, we were whiteboarding.
[82:52.45]Is this... this upcoming House Flipper thing gonna be lit as, uh, you could say?
[83:00.66]Uh, Lord Magus should have finished summoning Lavos by now.
[83:08.44]I won't be defeated by you, I won't.
[83:10.02]No attack can pierce my barrier.
[83:11.58]I'm invincible!
[83:17.10]Ice block.
[83:20.46]Uh... Wait, what the fuck is this?
[83:23.34]What does that do?
[83:25.52]I can't hurt him.
[83:28.32]What are you aiming at, you imbecile?
[83:33.45]Oh shit, I can't... Ha ha ha ha, missed me!
[83:54.17]Where do you think you're aiming?
[83:55.45]It's a scripted fight.
[84:07.88]You never played Poopslinger on Steam?
[84:09.90]It's a very family-friendly game.
[84:12.36]If you say so.
[84:13.00]See you later, Ozzy.
[84:16.52]Fucking dweeb.
[84:19.74]Oh!
[84:27.07]I love that sound.
[84:27.81]That's a great one too.
[84:28.43]Oh fuck.
[84:29.47]You guys better get ready.
[84:35.77]It's about to get.
[84:59.09]What's a cool word I can use?
[85:09.91]Did you save?
[85:13.59]Gnarly?
[85:14.03]Should we bet on the next boss?
[85:16.63]Um, I would say so because it's... It's a major one, so... At least I think it is.
[85:27.96]Crazy?
[85:33.66]Let me make sure I'm good.
[85:34.88]I got six mid potions.
[85:36.68]That might not be enough.
[85:39.90]Should I go for it or should I be a coward and go buy more potions?
[85:44.04]I don't think six is enough, but I have a bunch of group heals now.
[85:46.68]I'm going for it.
[85:48.00]Let's not be a coward.
[86:01.52]Don't aggro.
[86:05.83]I'm turning this one up by the way so this is gonna be kind of loud just to let you know
[86:31.83]Cast open the gates that lie betwixt heaven and Earth.
[86:40.33]In exchange for the life of this world.
[86:42.37]Kind of loud this morning.
[87:12.65]Alright.
[87:43.14]Magus.
[87:49.76]Magus.
[87:54.28]Oh, that frog of so many days ago.
[87:56.02]How have you fared since we last met?
[88:00.70]Well enough.
[88:01.28]I owe you my gratitude.
[88:02.34]This form has been a blessing in disguise.
[88:04.38]Without it, there are things I'd never have obtained.
[88:14.65]Ah, the Master Moon.
[88:16.68]Then you've come from here.
[88:17.56]Let us hope no others interfere this time.
[88:28.22]Again, the bitter black winds begin to howl.
[88:31.68]Very well.
[88:35.75]Come if it is death you seek.
[88:50.50]Absorbs everything but fire.
[88:52.08]Uh-oh.
[88:55.89]Yeowch!
[89:08.63]Hell geyser?
[89:09.47]Ooh!
[89:21.67]Uh, I need to do... I need heal.
[89:27.28]Let's do a big heal.
[89:29.84]Absorbs everything but fire right now.
[89:31.68]Do I have any fire moves?
[89:33.10]No, I don't have Luka.
[89:36.45]Let's do another heal.
[89:40.59]And then... Let's do some just sprayed up damage.
[89:45.42]Cleave.
[89:51.03]That was not great.
[89:52.95]Absorbs everything but light.
[89:54.65]That's... Ow!
[89:59.42]Okay, lightning?
[90:03.62]There we go, there we go, there we go, there we go, there we go!
[90:09.73]Absorbs everything but shadow?
[90:10.83]Okay, we're gonna change to a rebel.
[90:34.09]That's good.
[90:37.09]That's fine.
[90:37.49]Stay on shadow.
[90:44.69]Ow.
[90:46.45]I think I'm just going to do regular attack with Chrono.
[90:51.07]Try to get a crit.
[90:59.14]Robo is so slow.
[91:11.75]Everything but water.
[91:12.47]That's bad.
[91:16.59]That's bad.
[91:20.67]He's going to do it again.
[91:22.80]Oh, no, that's not good.
[91:24.94]Chrono's dead.
[91:30.48]No, he's not.
[91:31.32]What is he absorbing right now?
[91:41.67]What's it absorbing right now?
[91:42.51]Is it light?
[91:47.92]There we go.
[91:52.62]Okay, I can't do anything.
[91:53.56]I have to change it.
[92:01.33]It'll hurt him pretty badly with this, right?
[92:03.81]Hurt him with the Master Moon?
[92:04.70]Yep.
[92:05.26]I forgot.
[92:15.63]Hmm.
[92:17.73]Oh, his magic damage, uh, his magic!
[92:20.35]Did you see that?
[92:22.91]Uh, Roboche is going to be heal duty.
[92:33.01]Big crit.
[92:36.25]Okay, we need lightning.
[92:45.66]That's fine, that's fine, that's alright.
[92:47.98]Uh, frog's gonna heal now.
[93:01.17]I'm gonna hold, because I want to see what he does.
[93:10.74]Uh, lightning?
[93:13.08]And then frog heals.
[93:23.80]don't do it I gotta okay I gotta stagger this out because it's gonna kill people now uh that's bad actually so lucky
[93:46.97]have to do it.
[93:48.43]Is he weak too?
[93:49.21]Lightning?
[93:58.06]Still, who needs, somebody needs mana.
[94:00.20]No, actually everyone's alright.
[94:03.85]I think it's still shadow.
[94:06.77]We need, alright, I'm just going to heal Chrono and then see what happens.
[94:10.95]Still shadow, yeah.
[94:24.62]I'm gonna wait.
[94:35.32]Okay, that's fine.
[94:41.30]Hey, I know it's a boss fight, but are you gonna play WoW again?
[94:45.78]Standing up in the middle of the movie during the culminating part.
[94:49.90]The biggest fucking scene in the whole movie, standing up and asking if we're gonna go watch another movie after this.
[95:03.11]It's like we're in the middle of Infinity War and like here's the fucking shit's happening on the screen, like all the Avengers are there and you stand up and you just look at everybody standing and you go, um... Anybody know when Happy Guild War 2 comes out?
[95:19.30]Uh, what's he immune to?
[95:29.18]All he's seen is Marvel movies.
[95:32.30]I don't watch very many movies.
[95:34.94]Dark matter?
[95:36.80]What the fuck?
[95:39.44]This is gonna kill everybody?
[95:43.62]That's a lot of fucking damage.
[96:00.49]Oh, okay.
[96:02.49]Everything hurts him now.
[96:03.19]Go.
[96:05.43]Dude, fucking unload.
[96:08.08]Check this out.
[96:09.64]Unload.
[96:10.32]Triple attack.
[96:11.86]Dead, dead.
[96:13.26]I have my voice cracked, but who cares.
[96:16.04]Oh.
[96:18.18]Again.
[96:18.44]Do it again.
[96:28.22]Oh, he's doing this thing again.
[96:36.64]I'm not going to be greedy, I'm just going to heal the pole.
[96:51.77]Roblox needs mana.
[97:01.45]Okay.
[97:03.29]Guard is down.
[97:03.99]Go to the... I'm just doing it again.
[97:05.33]Fuck it.
[97:06.35]This is gritty.
[97:16.40]Uh, just... Yeah, top everybody off.
[97:24.54]I need ether.
[97:25.16]That's good.
[97:26.76]And let's do a big crit.
[97:30.56]Nice.
[97:45.08]Um... Let's... Do something!
[97:54.83]I'm gonna do the sphere.
[97:57.13]Barrier sphere on... ...Frog.
[98:01.64]And then, uh, let's just do Lapis right now.
[98:07.34]Now we're good.
[98:08.24]Okay, everyone's good?
[98:11.10]Smush him.
[98:37.97]Um... Just heal beam.
[98:47.39]That's a good tech I can do, guys.
[98:48.71]Maybe cleave.
[98:56.62]Should be double damage, right?
[99:00.54]That's good.
[99:01.89]Yes!
[99:02.13]Yes!
[99:12.78]Got it.
[99:27.88]Your skill with the Master Mune is that great already?
[99:34.95]Large-scale energy reaction detected.
[99:38.73]Could it be Lavos?
[99:42.89]No, he mustn't awaken from his slumber yet.
[99:46.87]Awaken?
[99:47.67]I do not understand.
[99:49.09]According to the records, Lavos was created here, at this precise moment.
[99:54.21]You fools.
[99:55.67]I but summoned him.
[99:56.69]He has dwelt within the Earth for eons, absorbing the land's energy and growing ever stronger.
[100:03.31]It appears my data was incorrect.
[100:07.26]What is this energy in the air?
[100:10.23]I am detecting the emergence of a gate of theoretically improbable proportions.
[100:16.10]You... If you had not interfered... An enormous gravity sink is forming.
[100:23.58]Whoa.
[100:35.65]Whoa.
[100:52.64]Crono?
[100:54.99]Crono?
[100:58.11]Crono, are you still sleeping?
[101:03.81]Honey, you'll be late for work.
[101:06.95]If you were me, I'd forgotten how beautiful Leen's bells sound.
[101:14.88]Crono?
[101:16.26]We can't keep asking my father for help.
[101:18.20]We need to hold down a job.
[101:23.52]Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Crono Cron
[101:57.55]Big frog present?
[101:59.19]For Isla eat?
[102:01.87]Perished the thought.
[102:03.73]But what of the pale-faced man in the cape?
[102:05.37]Was he not with us?
[102:08.19]No, only find you cape one more tasty.
[102:12.30]Oh no, she didn't eat him.
[102:14.10]She's asking if Magus is more flavorful.
[102:19.18]So he has fled.
[102:19.86]The records were incorrect.
[102:24.02]But if Magus did not create Lavos, then in what era did it originate?
[102:32.09]You no worry now.
[102:32.91]You rest.
[102:33.51]Hurt bad.
[102:50.95]Okay, now.
[102:52.25]I'm busy.
[102:53.39]I find Laruba Village.
[102:55.33]Find village, fight reptiles together.
[102:57.10]Big fight, last fight.
[102:58.48]Beat all reptiles, or reptiles beat us all.
[103:02.40]Kino!
[103:04.82]What wrong?
[103:05.48]Chrono, rest.
[103:06.10]You be quiet.
[103:08.42]Northward, fire, burn, big burn.
[103:25.17]Hold on.
[103:30.47]You come see me.
[103:31.21]What you have?
[103:32.55]Bang, petal, horn, feather.
[103:33.63]Give me six.
[103:34.69]Three each, two kind.
[103:35.61]I give you a good strong thing.
[103:36.88]What you give me?
[103:39.54]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[103:46.14]What else you give me?
[103:49.34]Um, how many, what do I need to give him?
[103:56.79]He got petals.
[103:58.59]Now he needs... Two of everything?
[104:03.87]Three of everything.
[104:04.57]Shit.
[104:11.37]Okay, trade for dreamstone gun.
[104:13.35]Oh no.
[104:15.01]But that's cool.
[104:17.75]Okay, give me three each, two kind.
[104:21.78]Petal.
[104:23.34]And horn.
[104:25.90]Dreamstone Bow.
[104:27.62]Uh, no.
[104:32.58]How about Fang and Horn?
[104:38.93]Trade for the Primeval Blade?
[104:41.39]Yeah?
[104:45.14]That sounds amazing.
[104:52.64]Holy shit.
[104:54.68]That's kind of disgusting.
[105:00.11]Yeah, that was Luka and Marle weapons.
[105:03.13]I'm probably not going to use Luka and Marle in my playthrough.
[105:08.11]I'm trending on a Frog, Isla, and Chrono.
[105:20.65]That's my theory.
[105:27.82]Or a different combination with frog.
[105:31.02]I want frog in the party always.
[105:33.30]He's a permanent member.
[105:34.02]Okay, magma hand.
[105:43.78]Okay, petal and feather is magma hand.
[105:47.98]Fang, feather, ruby vest.
[105:50.04]Okay, I need to... I just gotta farm for this stuff.
[105:51.82]Is there a save point here somewhere?
[106:05.03]Red star in sky.
[106:06.13]See even daytime.
[106:13.04]Oh, that's right.
[106:13.54]I don't know why I forgot I'm on a world map in, um...
[106:17.57]Forward to the past.
[106:18.33]Alright, the woods, right?
[106:26.63]The woods are causing a problem.
[106:27.83]Wait, was it up here?
[106:29.43]I think it's over here.
[106:29.99]Okay.
[106:37.68]Reptiles take Kino.
[106:39.52]Reptiles kill all trashed-off reptiles.
[106:41.54]What do now?
[106:42.14]Reptiles follow Isla.

[109:38.61]You gonna play more RoboCop?
[109:49.84]Not tonight.
[109:51.00]Not today.
[109:55.94]I got a feather.
[109:56.44]I have three of those now.
[110:16.97]Snuck by nice.
[110:21.93]Yeah, not tonight.
[110:23.35]But definitely on the table for another day.
[110:27.41]There's just a couple things planned this week.
[110:35.13]And I don't know how much Dark Souls 3 Ster and I are going to play.
[110:37.79]We'll do it at least one day.
[110:40.59]Maybe we get really into that.
[110:41.98]I'm not sure.
[110:43.40]Really depends.
[110:50.83]That will be likely tomorrow.
[110:52.41]Dark Souls 1 also has seamless co-op mod in the works.
[111:08.61]That would be crazy too.
[111:11.19]That is new.
[111:16.52]When can you add Otto to the party?
[111:46.44]I think pretty soon here, coming up in the next 10 to 15 minutes, I think.
[111:51.55]Hey.
[111:52.61]Frog level up.
[111:53.61]No!
[111:54.99]Frog needs to level up.
[112:17.62]Yeah.
[112:17.74]I haven't done it, but I've definitely thought about it.
[112:24.54]There's Dactyl.
[112:27.78]Croto!
[112:47.42]No, Tyranno Laird, danger!
[112:50.14]You no come, maybe all die!
[113:05.06]Let us be on our way, Crono.
[113:05.90]I'd have good friend.
[113:07.06]Let us proceed to the Tyranno lair.
[113:30.62]Looks like I just got tased.
[113:34.98]Okay.
[113:39.82]This is the, uh... What do we got for Groot?
[113:42.05]I think she needs tech.
[113:44.91]I need to bring Isla to Specio as well.
[113:47.79]Because I don't think... She doesn't have any magic, but... Ooh!
[113:56.47]Ooh!
[114:29.01]It's so funny that the third pterodactyl just doesn't have anybody on it because it's like, who did you pick?
[114:32.97]They don't know.
[114:34.71]Let's go.
[114:35.17]Okay, I do want to go back to the end of time.
[115:00.82]Where is the... it's up here, right?
[115:03.84]Like in the canyon?
[115:07.80]No, where is it?
[115:08.92]Forget it.
[115:09.56]I think it's down here.
[115:17.37]Mystic Mountains, right?
[115:18.79]Yeah, okay.
[115:32.80]Brown Dillo Kick.
[115:37.95]Yeah, she's got some of the hardest hitting physical attack in the game.
[116:04.08]Coming up on a break soon.
[116:05.30]Um, I think in about 5-10 minutes.
[116:10.93]Petalhorn.
[116:12.73]Lightning II.
[116:15.07]Slurp Kiss Dual Tech.
[116:17.53]Bubble Burst.
[116:20.30]Slurp Kiss.
[116:47.27]Yeah, I don't think she knows magic, but I want to bring her here.
[116:53.42]Oh, he's stronger looking now.
[116:56.73]Specio, bro.
[116:56.97]I could try to beat him again here.
[117:33.95]Specchio, bro, you gotta fucking settle down, dude.
[117:36.69]What does he say?
[117:43.91]Oh, he's talking about frog.
[117:46.03]Alright, everybody's good.
[118:04.74]Should I try to beat Specchio right now?
[118:09.30]I got lightning too.
[118:14.16]Can Isla hurt Specchio?
[118:15.30]I don't think Isla can hurt Specchio.
[118:27.14]Holy shit, she's dead.
[118:37.15]That move is so good, by the way.
[118:38.85]It's so ridiculous.
[118:43.92]Maybe they can both just do it.
[118:45.00]I need better heal.
[118:48.50]Nah, I think I'm still too weak.
[118:52.58]It's gonna be all Chrono, effectively.
[119:09.69]Uh, I'll just have her die.
[119:10.77]She's not gonna be able to do very much.
[119:17.35]Oh, never mind.
[119:18.87]Yeah, I don't want to waste potions and stuff right now.
[119:29.05]He's a little too strong.
[119:36.57]Yeah, this is a practice room.
[119:38.87]It's a practice room that keeps getting harder, and every time you beat Specchio, you get something for beating him.
[119:48.12]Alright, back to Tyranno Lair.
[120:05.48]Every time he changes forms, you get a new reward.
[120:07.64]Yeah.
[120:16.66]I'm going to be getting up here in about a minute or so.
[120:19.14]I'm just going to get to where we need to be.
[120:20.46]Actually, you know what?
[120:22.75]I'm going to make... Let me make some petals and stuff.
[120:25.89]It's going to kill everybody.
[120:33.49]That's so loud.
[120:34.15]I'm going to turn that down.
[120:42.70]Alright, give me some stuff.
[120:43.48]Horn.
[120:45.29]Only 96 of these guys?
[120:57.50]Petal.
[121:13.68]Alright, I'll be back.
[121:18.35]I will BRB.
[121:19.88]See you in about three, four minutes.
[122:24.83]Alright, let's do this.
[122:51.83]This person said, sorry, I just popped up.
[122:54.53]My sister recommended this stream to me, but I've been here five times and all five times has been on a BRB.
[123:00.28]You've checked once an hour.
[123:04.36]You've checked once an hour at the exact point of one hour.
[123:08.02]That's actually pretty funny.
[123:18.32]Well, it's on BRB.
[123:19.20]Maybe I'll check back in an hour.
[123:22.89]Alright, I'll be right back.
[123:55.12]Alright, let's do this.
[125:06.05]Alright, let's do this.
[126:25.70]Thanks for watching!
[127:48.76]I'm back.
[127:49.81]Made a tea, sorry.
[128:17.19]I made a tea.
[128:22.17]The music's driving me crazy.
[128:23.71]I'm sorry.
[128:27.55]What, are you gonna stream with Squeaks?
[128:39.10]Hey.
[128:40.92]Squeaks and I got big plans.
[128:42.24]Squeaks and I got big plans.
[128:48.50]And I coached him on his Insane Aquarium gameplay.
[128:56.15]I sent a message in his chat saying, hey, you should do it like this.
[129:03.99]So therefore I coached him.
[129:12.68]Do you slide in your socks?
[129:14.58]Like running around and sliding around?
[129:17.36]That's incredibly dangerous.
[129:18.30]You're gonna bump your head.
[129:22.66]Don't do that.
[129:23.17]Hey, no messing around in the house.
[129:28.95]Not gonna think it's so funny when you bump your head and have to go to the fucking... You have to get staples of stitches in your head.
[129:35.31]That's happened to me before, by the way.
[129:38.29]Have I ever told that story?
[129:40.99]Me and my brother were playing, um, like, martial arts.
[129:47.92]Uh, like pretend martial arts.
[129:52.98]And my brother had a friend or two over for a sleepover, and I had like a friend, I think it was just one or two people over.
[130:00.11]And we were jumping around on the bed, and we were playing fucking, oh, like, kick, attack, block!
[130:06.33]And my brother accidentally kicked, for real, a little too hard, and he was a little too close.
[130:11.37]And I flew back, and I flew off the bed, and I smashed my head onto the edge of the door of a fireplace.
[130:22.54]Uh, back of my head, it exploded open.
[130:26.71]It's funny because, uh, my brother was doing the thing where
[130:33.03]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't start crying.
[130:36.03]We're gonna get in trouble.
[130:37.65]So they were trying to make me laugh.
[130:39.40]I fell off, boom, smashed my head.
[130:41.82]And he was like, oh, hey, making faces and shit, and sticking his tongue out.
[130:48.26]We used to watch this movie.
[130:49.51]You guys ever see Police Academy?
[130:52.37]There's a scene in Police Academy where Bobcat Goldthwait's watch dies, because he was in the pool or something, and he's like, oh look, Mickey!
[130:59.84]He's dead!
[131:01.20]Is he like a Mickey Mouse watch or something?
[131:02.94]Um, and I was like, ha ha ha ha, that's so funny!
[131:07.55]I was laughing at them doing this.
[131:11.27]And, uh, I put my hand up while we were laughing, like, oh, yeah, shh, shh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't, mom and dad are gonna come downstairs, don't do that.
[131:19.33]So, they didn't want to hear me crying.
[131:21.91]So I put my hand on my head, because it hurt, and I took a look at it, and I put it right into the front of my, line of sight of my face, and my hand was covered in blood.
[131:32.28]Covered in blood.
[131:34.08]It was, I was like, I, I, it was like, it was like finger painting.
[131:36.32]It was like my hand was covered in blood.
[131:39.56]And that's when I screamed.
[131:42.20]And then it was, it was over at that point.
[131:44.08]I had to get five staples in the back of my head.
[131:51.47]That explains a lot.
[131:54.09]Oh, please.
[131:56.79]You're a s- I snitched?
[132:00.05]Well, the back of my head was caved in.
[132:01.89]I wouldn't mean I snitched on him.
[132:05.45]I was, I was bleeding.
[132:06.67]I have a cracked skull.
[132:11.33]A tattletale.
[132:13.39]Shut up.
[132:17.88]Back of my skull was fucking smashed in.
[132:20.58]Yeah, sorry, I screamed.
[132:22.32]Yeah, my mother had to take me to the fucking emergency room, but I had to get a bunch of staples in my head.
[132:35.21]And I remember when the staples were going in.
[132:38.60]I was in, like, I was kind of in shock.
[132:41.67]And it was actually like this.
[132:45.09]I was laying on this table and the doctor was like, with a staple gun, was like, And each one I would go, I would just laugh.
[132:56.41]And he's like, now settle down.
[132:57.71]Stop that.
[132:58.29]Settle down and sit down.
[133:06.84]Fucking Frankenstein.
[133:14.63]Did your mother take you to Home Depot?
[133:17.31]No, it was a doctor.
[133:18.53]It wasn't a back alley doctor.
[133:21.69]It was a real doctor.
[133:22.73]It was a hardware store.
[133:26.09]This was a real doctor's office.
[133:29.42]Why have you never told us this story?
[133:30.76]Hey, I'm in my broadcast arc.
[133:33.84]This is the I don't give a shit arc.
[133:35.20]I'll tell you all the fucked up things that have happened to me.
[133:47.86]He was a mafia doctor?
[133:49.32]How old was I?
[133:53.19]I was, I don't know, I was young.
[133:55.27]I was probably like 10, 11 maybe at the time.
[133:59.85]When did Police Academy 2 come out?
[134:02.39]That movie.
[134:03.57]The one I'm talking about with Bobcat Goldthwait and he's like, oh Mickey!
[134:09.81]Oh, I just realized that this music's just been going.
[134:17.38]Severely injuring a sibling is a universal experience.
[134:20.20]Yeah.
[134:23.83]Oh yeah.
[134:27.65]Yeah, it was surgical staples.
[134:29.05]You guys, what do you guys don't know anything about medicine?
[134:35.37]Me and my brother used to fuck around so much, though.
[134:37.31]It was... It was kind of a disaster.
[134:40.33]I told you, I used to get in a bunch of hockey equipment and, like, he would just kind of, like, beat the shit out of me.
[134:45.86]We would just see, like, how much I could take.
[134:47.54]I used to get in full hockey equipment with, like, pads and, like, shoulder pads and, like, a goalie outfit.
[134:59.28]And we would see just how much he could beat the shit out of me with me taking it.
[135:13.37]There was one time when my brother was into sports, and I kind of was too a little bit early on.
[135:20.03]But hold on, let me lower this.
[135:22.37]But he used to be like, oh, hey, sit down and catch.
[135:26.27]I want to throw like pitch.
[135:27.35]I want to pitch to you.
[135:29.53]And I'm like, okay.
[135:31.53]And I would get into the hockey equipment because I was so bad at it that like he would just throw baseballs at me and like hit me in the face and stuff.
[135:39.56]And I had like the shield on and everything.
[135:41.99]So he literally was throwing baseballs as hard as he could at me, and I was just kind of his catcher.
[135:46.95]We did that like a few times.
[135:59.79]The mask makes it less bad.
[136:01.29]Yeah, I mean, I had like, that's the, I had a real equipment on.
[136:04.70]I didn't put on like a... I was protected, don't worry.
[136:10.70]It was fun, yeah.
[136:11.68]I don't care.
[136:12.12]It was... I... I... Hey.
[136:16.92]I've... I've had... I've had... I've been hit in the face with a shovel.
[136:20.31]I've been... I've like fallen off of fucking roofs.
[136:26.03]I've been like fucked up a few times.
[136:28.07]I feel like that happens to everybody though.
[136:29.37]Don't you kind of get like fucked up when you're younger?
[136:41.61]I feel like there's a certain percentage of us that had these childhoods where... Yeah, I, uh... Yeah, I got hit in the face with a frying pan.
[136:49.02]What are you talking about?
[136:49.76]That didn't happen to you?
[136:53.14]Wait, you didn't drop a bowling ball on your foot and break it?
[136:56.00]Oh.
[136:56.96]You didn't?
[137:07.18]Never broken a bone.
[137:08.46]I've only broken one bone and it was my collarbone and I did it when I was like three.
[137:13.66]I fell forward on a chair and I shattered it.
[137:18.56]Looney Tunes childhood?
[137:19.96]I think that's just the 90s childhood.
[137:21.98]90s childhood was just Looney Tunes childhood.
[137:34.99]I remember we used to throw fucking, like, the crab apples at each other.
[137:39.93]We would have crab apple fights.
[137:43.09]We would just pick them up, they would kind of, they would fall off the ground in the, in the, uh, over the seasons.
[137:48.51]And it's just like, oh, we're gonna like throw these at each other.
[137:50.41]And they kind of hurt, it was like getting hit with like a paintball.
[138:03.95]Me and my buddy used to wait for his parents to go out so we could jump off the roof of his two-story house.
[138:09.13]We'd do it for hours.
[138:11.49]Yeah, Leather Jacket understands what's going on.
[138:19.66]I'm not saying that's how you should live your lifestyle.
[138:21.52]I'm just saying that I... I feel like, uh... I feel like when I was younger, I feel like I was getting hurt all the time.
[138:34.22]How come this- what's going on with my screen?
[138:35.96]There we go.
[138:49.35]Remember, we're Gen Z. We have helicopter parents.
[138:51.89]The most injury I've ever had was biting my lip.
[138:57.16]No, there's gotta be more, right?
[138:59.77]No, there's gotta be more.
[139:01.05]You have to have had something.
[139:02.06]Like, you didn't- Like, you didn't- Wait, none of you kids fell off a roof?
[139:19.79]I kinda wanna see a poll.
[139:21.05]There's a lot of 25 to 35 year olds here.
[139:22.89]Let's see a poll.
[139:29.01]Did you have a serious injury?
[139:30.91]I don't even word this.
[139:32.75]I don't even know how you word this.
[139:40.03]I remember getting like a trash can thrown at me.
[140:00.31]Did you ever get a loony... Okay, that's a good way to put it.
[140:03.03]Did you ever get a Looney Tunes injury as a kid?
[140:14.36]We used to take turns... Hold on, what's this person saying?
[140:16.60]We used to take turns putting ourselves in cardboard boxes and then our friends would beat the shit out of us.
[140:22.65]Yeah, that counts.
[140:24.13]I think that counts.
[140:31.91]Alright, we need to go to the lair.
[140:35.08]Reptite lair.
[140:38.02]Should I get some of the gear?
[140:38.88]Let me get some of the gear.
[140:40.66]Yeah, I feel like most people have had something like that happen before.
[140:52.39]You guys ever, like, stepped on a rake and did the sideshow Bob where it hits you in the face or anything?
[140:56.51]That actually happened to me once in real life and I couldn't believe it.
[140:59.09]I couldn't believe it.
[140:59.87]I was like, there's no way that this actually is real.
[141:02.61]It actually hurt me.
[141:03.46]I got hit in the face.
[141:06.38]It almost fucking shit.
[141:07.30]It almost broke my nose.
[141:09.16]That shit actually happened in real life.
[141:11.28]I'm not kidding.
[141:19.28]Hold on.
[141:19.76]I'm very curious about this.
[141:28.08]You ever get a Looney Tune injury?
[141:29.36]Okay, it seems like most people have.
[141:31.10]This is almost 75%.
[141:32.40]You guys are fine.
[141:34.06]See?
[141:35.32]You guys are fine.
[141:43.63]You guys are fine.
[141:44.65]I need... I have plenty of petals.
[141:51.21]I need fangs.
[141:55.11]Didn't I get... Okay.
[141:55.71]Okay.
[141:59.60]I can get something now.
[142:00.90]What should I get?
[142:01.66]Alright, let's do Feather and Petal.
[142:17.89]Magma Hand.
[142:18.67]That's for Robo.
[142:19.71]I'm gonna say no.
[142:26.13]What about Feather and Horn?
[142:30.19]I think I want the vest.
[142:31.37]Stone helm.
[142:33.89]No, let's get the actual chest piece and give it to somebody.
[142:36.47]Feather and fang.
[142:41.70]Okay, there we go.
[142:43.70]Ruby vest, yes.
[142:46.64]Now who should get that?
[142:54.47]So are you messed up?
[142:55.45]Are you messed up if you didn't get a traumatic injury as a child?
[142:59.39]No, I don't think so.
[143:01.61]I think you're fine.
[143:12.10]Oh, Isla already has a Ruby Vest on.
[143:19.67]Halves fired.
[143:20.39]I feel like I'm going to need that here.
[143:21.41]Give it a chrono.
[143:36.10]I got two ruby vests on, that should be good.
[143:42.39]I love how everybody now is sharing their traumatic Looney Tunes, I, like, broke my arm, uh, chat messages.
[143:57.00]I just look over and I just see all these things that have happened to you.
[144:02.00]Bonding together.
[144:19.52]Holy shit, that's loud.
[144:22.40]I can't listen to that.
[144:23.55]Hold on a second.
[144:24.29]Alright, uh... I can't really turn it down because the music will turn down and that's just not happening, you know?
[144:37.56]Running down and sliding down a dirt hill into a chain link fence.
[144:43.78]I was sledding and smashed the back of my head on the telephone pole.
[144:46.16]It made my nose bleed.
[144:47.18]I was perfectly fine.
[144:49.98]I'm just reading the mod chat right now.
[144:52.60]Is this the wrong lair?
[144:55.30]Oh, it is rare.
[144:58.43]Rare.
[145:00.49]It's the wrong one.
[145:01.15]It's the Tyranno lair.
[145:07.51]Whoa, that looks to be it.
[145:13.58]Ah this is a good song too.
[145:14.48]Lightning too will kill everything.
[145:47.27]It didn't?
[145:47.73]What?
[145:52.18]Oh, defense is lowered.
[145:58.09]Damn.
[146:13.98]Laughing so hard, I'm imagining somebody coming into the stream right now and seeing this fucked up chat.
[146:20.10]Yeah, like why are they all talking about when, like, when they were hurt as children?
[146:23.24]These things scared me when I was younger.
[146:49.61]I don't think they would think that.
[146:51.98]Nah.
[146:53.56]Nah, you're right.
[146:54.62]Nah.
[146:58.24]I need more TP.
[147:02.78]I need TP.
[147:15.44]Want to bring it here?
[147:16.02]No?
[147:33.93]I also stuck a marble up my nose and had to go to the ER to get it out.
[147:38.43]How many marble up the nose cases do you think ERs get every day?
[147:42.26]Do you think it's more than one?
[147:53.14]And do you think that at some point, here comes the one for the day?
[147:56.80]At least five a week?
[148:04.95]Less than they used to, probably.
[148:10.04]It's two kids per day in the US?
[148:32.87]We're about to have a feast, and you're about to be the roast beast.
[148:35.95]A human!
[148:39.13]A human!
[148:39.87]A human!
[148:40.87]It's the apes!
[148:42.40]No, it can't be the apes from the critically acclaimed chimpanzee.
[148:48.06]The odyssey of the apes.
[149:08.02]Planet of the Odyssey of the Apes.
[149:17.11]Did we use the knuckle smasher butt scooters in gym class?
[149:19.83]Yeah.
[149:20.67]The little yellow ones.
[149:25.21]And for some reason, the gym teachers at the time thought that, hey, you know what's a good idea?
[149:31.57]Let's go ahead and make a game where we put all the kids.
[149:36.45]We give everyone one of these.
[149:38.68]So every single kid got to sit on one.
[149:42.04]Start at one end of the gym and another group of you start at the other end of the gym and go as fast as you possibly can, crossing each other's paths back and forth.
[149:55.83]Whoever goes fastest and makes a lap back and forth wins.
[150:08.40]Do you think they secretly sat there and were just like, oh man, this is going to be chaos.
[150:15.30]Can't open it.
[150:20.44]Isla.
[150:21.02]Kino, move back.
[150:21.84]Isla, save Kino.
[150:32.31]Oh my god.
[150:34.91]She actually got in.
[150:35.83]Hmm.
[150:40.91]Kino, sorry.
[150:41.73]All Kino's fault.
[150:45.77]It okay.
[150:46.27]Kino take all Garuba person.
[150:48.41]Run.
[150:50.37]What Isla do?
[150:51.89]Strong.
[150:52.39]Live.
[150:52.69]Weak.
[150:52.95]Die.
[150:53.27]Isla go.
[150:53.77]Be strong.
[150:55.77]Kino go too.
[150:57.72]Kino no come.
[150:58.44]Isla die.
[150:59.00]Kino no Ayoka chief.
[151:03.46]Isla.
[151:15.17]Ooh That works
[151:45.61]Nice job.
[151:46.39]You strong, Kino weak.
[151:47.60]Kino jealous.
[152:23.11]Eye potion.
[152:23.69]Uh-oh.
[152:28.65]It was a trap all along.
[152:30.21]Actually, this is kind of bad.
[152:31.49]I want to play the game under the parachute.
[152:40.03]Oh, that's right.
[152:40.79]I forgot about the parachute thing.
[152:44.56]Where it's like, oh yeah, just trap people under there.
[152:47.46]Trap them under there.
[152:55.02]That thing was so much fun.
[153:04.27]What do they do in gym class now?
[153:05.75]It's been 30 years since I've been there.
[153:14.18]Is it just running?
[153:14.88]Do you just run?
[153:17.10]Is it the same shit?
[153:21.66]Dodgeball?
[153:22.24]Dodgeball's fun.
[153:29.25]ipads they do not give you an iPad at gym class your is not what I give you an iPad it's very similar gym teachers play music really loud though I would imagine some of those games are still around
[153:59.46]Lightning rod goes hard.
[154:00.56]Who is it?
[154:00.94]Is it Isla?
[154:08.90]Now it's frog.
[154:09.84]Oh, lightning tube and aerial strike.
[154:12.09]Damn.
[154:16.91]Giant balloon ball thing.
[154:23.25]I don't remember very much.
[154:24.11]I'm trying to remember what I actually...
[154:28.51]I remember the parachute.
[154:29.27]I remember the scooters.
[154:31.05]I remember pickleball.
[154:31.99]Pickleball was huge.
[154:45.37]Pickleball is just tennis for people that can't play it.
[154:52.37]And honestly, good.
[154:53.75]It's more fun.
[154:55.89]If you don't care about tennis, it's way more fun.
[155:11.20]Did you get an effing pickleball?
[155:14.10]No, but I remember I tried to run the mile really, really fast because I wanted to impress everybody and I ended up puking behind a tree and they had put me in a wheelchair.
[155:23.45]Ooh, thunder what?
[155:24.23]Did I just get... Thunder chomp.
[155:38.24]Cool.
[155:42.75]yeah we used to do this thing where it was what the the fitness test it was the you could do this one and pass or you could do the I think was called the presidential version and be one of the best and I was like oh man I want to try to get that it was the reaching you reach it on the box they put the box and you sit with the box you put your hands out
[156:09.96]Uh, there was like a pull-up, I think you had a certain amount of pull-ups, certain amount of push-ups got you like to the presidential leaderboard.
[156:17.22]And one of them I believe was to do the mile.
[156:19.04]I think it was in under 10 minutes or 11 minutes.
[156:23.85]No, I think it was even like eight minutes.
[156:25.35]It was something actually pretty, pretty vigorous.
[156:29.31]Um, and I did it.
[156:31.25]I sprinted.
[156:33.07]I was that weirdo that was just like, I'm going to run this and just try to do it quick.
[156:40.37]And I ended up, I did it way too much, I did it way too fast.
[156:43.91]And I ended up puking behind a tree.
[156:45.71]And they had to put me in a wheelchair.
[156:47.81]And I got like wheeled around.
[156:49.17]And everyone was like looking at you through the hallways like, what happened?
[156:53.18]What, was it alright?
[156:54.06]What's going on?
[156:55.08]It's like, it's like Moses parting the fucking sea.
[156:59.00]I was, I'm in a wheelchair and I'm just rolling down and just people are just parting and like, I'm just being presented.
[157:08.21]Everyone's just partying, looking, partying, look, look, look, oh my god.
[157:23.28]He's delusional.
[157:25.78]No, I'm just, I'm saying it's like that's, it was people just looking at you.
[157:29.32]How many times have you, I know a lot of people have been in that scenario.
[157:38.30]Liar, you had a ball problem.
[157:39.36]That's why you couldn't finish it.
[157:40.26]You told the story before.
[157:43.96]That was a different... That was a different story.
[157:48.69]This happened over... That's a different year.
[157:50.69]And I twisted my ball sack and like... I had like a testicle fucking ball twist and...
[158:07.97]Alright, hold on, I gotta pay attention.
[158:21.60]You're a liar.
[158:24.96]I wonder how I told the story before.
[158:26.38]No, I don't think it was that.
[158:36.10]I don't think it was that serious.
[158:48.28]Stop talking about your balls, please.
[158:49.72]There's only one bingo square left.
[158:55.66]No, I ran the mile and I puked.
[158:57.99]Did it have something to do with my balls?
[158:59.17]I think that was a different day.
[159:00.59]That was a different story.
[159:04.51]I don't know.
[159:05.41]We can run the tape on it.
[159:09.51]Okay, I remember I did the mile, I puked behind a tree, and I had to get wheeled around in a wheelchair.
[159:16.01]It could have been the same day.
[159:17.59]But that's what I remember.
[159:35.62]Okay, I got some new stuff.
[159:41.00]The Triceratoper.
[159:43.67]I'm going to give that to Isla.
[159:48.69]Stonehelm.
[159:58.18]I want the fire defense, I think, though, still.
[160:02.54]Give it to Frog.
[160:04.12]Frog already has one on.
[160:06.74]I think this boss coming up is fire.
[160:27.21]How about for a change, you tell us a story of you doing something nice for your balls.
[160:30.89]Sure.
[160:33.79]Uh, yesterday, I took a bath.
[160:36.71]I took a... I did a little bit of a me day.
[160:44.62]What?
[160:47.32]What?
[160:47.56]What happened?
[160:50.22]Alright, fine.
[160:50.64]That's it.
[160:50.92]That's all you need to know.
[160:54.22]Fine.
[160:54.42]That's it.
[160:55.20]That's it.
[160:59.84]I want to try this new move.
[161:02.69]Let's do... Is it a lightning rod?
[161:11.49]Oh, who has no mana?
[161:13.05]Oh, Crono needs mana.
[161:16.19]What?
[161:18.36]Crono needs mana.
[161:22.62]How about Slurp Kiss?
[161:31.26]I love that move.
[161:34.74]Alright, Lightning Rod.
[161:46.59]That's pretty amazing.
[161:55.46]It's an ugly Charmander.
[162:02.37]Would you stop being so mean to fucking our favorite characters in the game?
[162:11.45]What about Thunder Chomp?
[162:16.03]Oh, you strike her with lightning and she bites him.
[162:19.24]Cool.
[162:38.39]Favorite video game character of all time?
[162:44.44]I don't know.
[162:52.60]It's not Sonic.
[163:04.91]Pac-Man.
[163:05.37]Pac-Man is cool, yeah.
[163:12.16]What did you spit at me?
[163:17.32]Uh, I think my favorite... would probably be... I'd have to think about it.
[163:32.11]Probably somebody from an old game, though.
[163:35.76]Although I think the spy from Team Fortress might be one of the coolest, most funny, interesting characters.
[163:42.28]It might be the spy.
[163:43.68]Or the heavy.
[163:44.86]It actually might be the heavy.
[164:00.67]I have opened the door.
[164:07.64]Can we hear more about that me day?
[164:10.87]Yes, alright, so wait a minute.
[164:12.41]Everybody relax.
[164:13.69]We have to fight this guy.
[164:23.27]Alright, don't do don't die.
[164:37.25]Looking for Azala?
[164:38.97]She's just through here.
[164:40.29]Oh, thanks for letting me through.
[164:46.01]What a nice guy.
[164:58.92]Unnatural selection.
[165:13.48]Jeez.
[165:14.62]Hold it!
[165:15.70]When I said she's through here, I meant you've got to get through me first.
[165:18.48]What do you think I was flexing my muscles and looking all intimidating for?
[165:21.28]Let's get that lightning rod.
[165:30.30]I'm gonna kill this guy very, very easily.
[165:38.17]We are a destructive team.
[165:50.08]What about Drill Kick?
[165:52.96]Nice.
[165:53.44]Okay, we need Lightning again.
[165:55.32]Lightning Rod, then Drill Kick.
[165:57.94]That's what I'm thinking.
[166:22.72]I have a cat attack.
[166:52.33]Oof.
[166:57.15]Alright, we have Slurpkus.
[167:21.50]It's pretty easy.
[167:25.91]I need a big physical... I'm going to do X-Strike.
[167:27.43]I need a big physical attacker.
[167:30.87]I missed that move.
[167:31.95]I really do.
[167:35.52]The triple with Robo, it does so much damage.
[167:37.98]It's like 800 or 900 damage.
[167:55.32]Alright, lightning again?
[167:59.12]Oh shit, hold on.
[168:01.88]Wrong person!
[168:08.73]Lightning rod.
[168:19.31]Electric shock!
[168:26.23]Uh, don't get too cocky here, because I can lose.
[168:33.42]Would it be funny if you lost?
[168:49.29]Haha, think about it, haha.
[168:55.36]What the heck?
[168:58.45]What?
[168:58.87]I mean, what?
[168:59.23]I love how she kinda looks annoyed.
[169:06.64]Like, what is this?
[169:07.34]Damn.
[169:26.88]There's no way I'd lose this.
[169:31.44]It's just not gonna happen.
[169:34.67]I'm gonna do Lightning Rod.
[169:37.05]Oh yeah!
[169:53.88]That's a lot of flashes.
[170:04.77]Level up, level up.
[170:08.92]Alright, that was just a little warm up.
[170:11.66]I believe the next fight is pretty, pretty rough.
[170:15.84]I remember.
[170:21.95]I have... I think I'm alright.
[170:28.23]I have a few mid potions.
[170:29.73]I've got ethers.
[170:30.89]We got the slurp kiss.
[170:32.17]We'll be fine.
[170:36.05]I haven't really seen a game over the whole game, so... I'm good for it.
[171:03.09]big.
[171:05.57]Eyeless crit is one of my favorite in the games besides frog.
[171:07.49]It just does this huge off the top rope just giant swing double axe antelope.

[173:52.92]No, no Robocop tonight.
[173:56.82]I want to get pretty far in Chrono Trigger because I'm imagining I'll get pretty close.
[174:04.58]I'm at more than halfway through the game.
[174:06.34]No.
[174:18.04]shit do you like this game or did you lose a bet bro that's rage bait that's gotta be rage bait
[174:59.60]Did you learn a new word?
[175:00.72]That comment may as well be nuclear waste.

[177:01.96]Does nobody do any tech moves when you do auto battle?
[177:05.10]He's gonna kill us.
[177:31.49]Now, Isla, strike!
[177:32.87]You should turn it off for easy battles.
[177:38.21]That's actually not a bad idea.
[177:39.54]Okay, that's stupid.
[177:46.62]I'm reloading the save.
[177:51.45]This is precious stuff that I'm going to be getting rid of.
[177:53.29]That's not fair.
[178:02.30]I didn't want to exit the whole game.
[178:03.78]I wanted to just quit to the menu.

[179:20.11]So there's going to be a big boss battle through this door.
[179:23.10]And I'm going to take a break before we do it.
[179:30.85]At last, the final confrontation.
[179:33.43]It was but a matter of time.
[179:35.75]Will it be we reptites who inherit the Earth, or you soft-skinned apes?
[179:43.06]Strong live, weak die.

[190:15.22]Good luck harming me.
[190:16.78]We're going to try to get rid of the Izala first.
[190:23.64]That was 3D.
[190:41.42]I hurt a lot.
[190:42.32]Holy shit.
[190:42.88]Okay, I gotta do lightning rod on him.
[190:48.14]Lightning rod on you.
[190:50.71]No, on you.
[190:59.91]Oof.
[191:04.83]Uh, we need you to slurp.
[191:06.35]I need you to slurp.

[191:14.13]He's dead.
[191:14.69]I need you to slurp.
[191:23.66]That move sucks.
[191:27.12]He's dead again.
[191:30.92]X-Strike.
[191:45.59]I need to lock in.
[191:46.41]Yeah, I know.
[191:47.61]I got it.
[191:47.87]I got it.
[191:51.39]Imagine doubting when I've not lost a single fight, like two thirds of the way through the whole game.
[192:10.88]What does that do?
[192:11.60]Is it do status effect?
[192:19.16]How he's asleep, shit.
[192:20.88]Where's that shit that I have?
[192:26.38]Sorry.
[192:38.57]Why does the boss look like he's streaming with a webcam on?
[192:41.15]Well, he's dead.
[192:50.07]Alright, this guy is hardy.
[192:58.91]Is it lightning or is it... Okay, I think it's lightning.
[193:05.82]Okay, lower defense storing power.
[193:12.88]There we go.
[193:13.42]Alright, now we need to do...

[195:10.22]Uh, Thunder Chomp.
[195:12.36]And then, uh, Lick Yourself.
[195:28.05]Let's do... X-Strike is so good.
[195:32.11]And then Lightning Rod is good, too.
[195:41.81]Alright, this is it.
[195:42.85]Make sure I'm at full health.
[195:58.90]That should be good.
[196:00.36]Yeah, fine, I think.
[196:05.10]Who's up licking?
[196:06.67]Oh, he said something.
[196:08.73]What about water?
[196:09.43]Just water.
[196:10.81]Standard water.
[196:26.00]900 damage!
[196:26.95]That was almost a thousand damage!
[196:30.57]That was disgusting.
[196:31.55]Shit, who needs mana?
[196:36.60]Frog.
[196:53.37]I love that frog's scared face, it's funny.
[196:59.11]Oh, hold on.
[196:59.65]It does a lot of damage if you don't have it though.
[197:15.60]Alright, I need MP.
[197:27.60]lightning rod and drill kick.
[197:34.58]Look at that lightning one again.
[197:50.09]That thing is so good.
[198:06.11]Why do we have points?
[198:07.23]What do we do with them?
[198:09.07]I'm working on it.
[198:10.03]I'm working on a system.
[198:22.03]No, you're not.
[198:22.51]Yes I am.
[198:22.95]I'm working on a system.
[198:36.87]That does so much damage.
[198:38.13]I think I'll kill him right now.
[198:45.52]I'll do lightning rod right here.
[198:47.48]That should do it.
[198:48.26]Lightning moves are so good.
[199:02.10]Excellent.
[199:03.92]I did it.
[199:04.20]Level up.
[199:08.02]Level up.
[199:09.22]Level up.
[199:15.92]Do you know how much I lose believers points?
[199:20.63]How could you even bet against me now?
[199:24.01]No, it can't be.
[199:25.79]Could the heavens truly have sided with the apes?
[199:30.12]listen primates and let it be known for all time we reptites fought proudly to the bitter end I don't know what the fuck was that oh my god stop first a great fiery stone will crash to the Earth its flames will soon spread to scorch every corner of the land
[199:59.57]So 65 million years ago
[200:28.92]Lavos crashes into the Earth.
[200:33.24]Wipes the fucking place out.
[200:35.76]Causes an age of ice age.
[200:43.52]And then sits there.
[200:52.51]I la people word la mean fire, vos mean big.
[200:58.05]Big fire.

[201:56.27]See you later.
[202:14.68]This fucker crash lands.
[202:24.66]Kills everything.
[202:27.24]Lavos was not spawned by Magus.
[202:29.32]It fell from the heavens and so long ago.
[202:39.56]Lavos huge.
[202:40.52]I don't know fight that.
[202:45.70]Oh no, we go place Lavos Fall.
[202:53.25]Left to its own devices, the creature will burrow deep into the Earth.
[202:57.01]Best defeat it now.
[203:05.98]The ruins.
[203:13.30]Just a smoldering crater.
[203:21.35]Where is it?
[203:24.03]Is it in the crater?
[203:30.99]Save, bro.
[203:32.09]Save.
[203:32.52]I can't.
[203:33.12]I can't, dude.
[203:39.44]I want to save.
[203:47.70]There we go.
[203:48.22]Okay, now let's go.
[203:54.16]A gate?
[204:00.46]Lavos vast, deep under Earth now.
[204:06.36]Might Lavos be the source of these?
[204:07.84]That one in Magus's keep was immense.
[204:13.85]What wrong, Crono?
[204:14.79]Want fight Lavos?
[204:15.63]Go here?
[204:16.11]No?
[204:29.19]Yeah, Laos, big fire.
[204:37.87]Where have we come?
[204:38.59]I don't know where this place.
[204:52.64]It's destroyed.
[205:15.06]Skyway.
[205:38.36]Where the hell are we?
[205:44.22]Enhassa.
[205:44.66]12,000 BC.
[205:55.36]This is the magic kingdom of Zeal, where dreams can be made reality.
[205:58.98]But nothing in this world comes free.
[206:02.09]There is always a price to be paid.
[206:12.79]Welcome to Inhasa, Zeal's city of dreams.
[206:15.55]We seek enlightenment within the bliss of sleep.
[206:18.89]Hmm, you are not of us, are you?
[206:27.44]You are most unusual visitors.
[206:29.88]Am I waking, or is this but a continuation of my dream?
[206:34.36]Regardless of that, I welcome you to Zeal.
[206:36.04]Her Majesty Queen Zeal rules this magic kingdom.
[206:39.41]She's without peer in beauty or grace.
[206:44.70]We owe our prosperity to Her Majesty the Queen.
[206:47.76]After the king died, she encouraged the development of our kingdom's magical prowess, which has led to the great advancements.
[207:03.03]Everything is so advanced.
[207:07.17]The queen has sealed away the great elemental weapons and armors forged with the power of the sun in the shrine to the north.
[207:14.56]You can see its entrance on the northern continent, and no one is allowed inside it now.
[207:31.25]The door to the northern shrine is sealed by a powerful force even we, the enlightened ones, lack the means to open.
[207:39.30]Come to do business.
[207:41.90]Uh, yeah.
[207:43.69]Come to do business.
[207:52.57]These are way too expensive.
[207:53.87]I hate buying these.
[208:06.04]These are so expensive, my god!
[208:13.86]Can you please install Bonzi Buddy?
[208:15.12]Is that good enough for you?
[208:18.58]He seems like a sullen lad.
[208:20.38]What wrong?
[208:20.72]That animal for eat taste good?
[208:45.40]I actually have never had Isla in the party like this
[209:14.49]I love her commentary.
[209:18.47]You get kind of the exposition through their reactions to things, and it's just... It's just kind of like, oh, I love kill.
[209:25.24]Eat that cat.
[209:28.66]It's like, yeah, that's funny.
[209:33.48]This is a font of recovery.
[209:35.63]Rest your wearied mind and body within, traveler.
[209:41.85]Nice.
[209:45.88]I wonder what's within the Northern Shrine.
[209:47.62]My Delta key to unlock its shield is held at the palace, but entry there is strictly forbidden.
[209:52.64]Alright, you get the idea.
[209:55.93]You get the idea.
[209:56.73]Whoa.
[209:59.47]Whoa.
[210:02.17]You get the idea.
[210:02.83]Something fucked up is going on.
[210:10.18]Something's not right here
[210:38.95]I don't know.
[210:39.75]You bring a Bostonian here.
[210:41.25]He'll figure this out.
[210:41.93]He'll know something's fucked up here.
[210:45.01]Where's the new... I want to get the new character.
[210:46.42]The fucking Boston guy.
[210:47.52]Just give him a wrench.
[210:49.08]He'll figure it out.
[210:52.02]I am Doreen.
[210:53.20]Seek the hidden path and open up the doors of knowledge each in turn.
[211:00.95]Your cousin from Boston.
[211:04.21]Oh, it's Sam Adams.
[211:05.31]I'm a fucking logger.
[211:06.13]You know what I mean?
[211:06.71]I'm a freaking logger.
[211:20.54]We've teleported.
[211:33.35]The whole world is destroyed.
[211:35.65]Yet the city in the sky is here.
[211:48.30]No joke, I never finished this game, but you streaming it made me pick it back up again.
[211:51.52]I'm so hooked.
[211:54.16]It's a great game.
[211:57.16]It's just fun to kind of travel around and see.
[211:59.85]Kind of like a story-based, turn-based RPG back in the day.
[212:05.03]It's very good.
[212:05.69]I like it a lot.
[212:06.83]Blackbird.
[212:08.33]Ajar.
[212:10.26]What is she doing?
[212:16.22]This is the magic city of Qajar.
[212:18.35]We perform research in the magical arts to help further Her Majesty's plans to develop... Can I cut?
[212:24.51]Can I try that again?
[212:25.09]Yeah, well, it's... I don't like how it's written.
[212:30.37]How many?
[212:30.65]Take another one?
[212:32.13]Yeah.
[212:32.39]You still rolling?
[212:33.51]Okay.
[212:35.00]It's just I don't like the way it's written.
[212:36.86]Can I do... Instead of we perform, can I do that... Can I say that performing research?
[212:40.82]Okay.
[212:42.90]Okay.
[212:44.22]That's not too bad, right?
[212:44.92]They can just, in the localization, they can change it.
[212:46.88]Alright, you rolling on two?
[212:49.36]Yep.
[212:50.58]Three, two.
[212:52.09]Performing research in the magical arts to help further Her Majesty's plans to deliver our kingdom even greater glory is the plan.
[212:58.29]Is that one art?
[213:00.65]Alright.
[213:03.67]Yeah, we'll seal that one.
[213:04.89]Lock that one in.
[213:10.86]Your power differs from ours.
[213:18.53]It's difficult to describe, but in you I sense a strange kindness.
[213:30.11]cut everyone go home this sucks no no in ancient times people crafted wondrous weapons in armor by combining shards of a rainbow colored shell with the sun stone's power now only the guru of life knows the art of crafting such things and even if others did the queen has ordered us to abandon use of the sun's power
[213:54.70]Ah, such beauteous contentment there is in a newly blossomed bud!
[213:59.41]Would that I could be a flower!
[214:01.21]Haunted recovery, yeah.
[214:08.24]Magical books.
[214:13.44]Ugh.
[214:45.41]I have platinum armor too but I need her majesty's permission to sell it oh boy what tempest must rage in young lord Janice's head his only friend other than his sister is that cat that follows him around
[215:08.51]Okay, I get the idea.
[215:08.93]Ooh, magical.
[215:09.27]Too bad, eh?
[215:35.90]I heard a strange prophet has come to the palace.
[215:38.44]I do not know the details, but I heard he has powers most uncanny.
[215:45.57]Water summons wind.
[215:47.37]Wind makes fire dance.
[215:52.26]Guru once told me that the Sun Stone once held all the nearly infinite energy of the Sun.
[215:56.92]Over time, the energy was slowly depleted and it turned into the Lightless Moon Stone.
[216:03.71]Oh shit, is that a... let me see Oh, Vinny has a new emote?
[216:06.05]That's cool
[216:35.27]What?
[216:37.05]That's cool.
[216:40.14]I can get some cool emotes!
[216:42.86]That's a cool emote.
[216:51.09]How is it that we came to have the powers we do?
[216:53.69]Why do some possess the gift while others lack it?
[216:56.29]It is a conundrum.
[217:01.97]The structure you can see deep beneath the waves below is the Ocean Palace, a symbol of our Queen's greatness.
[217:06.69]The palace is the beacon of light which will guide us a brighter future.
[217:11.14]All praise the great and wondrous Queen Zeal.
[217:17.16]The construction of the Ocean Palace has fallen behind schedule.
[217:20.18]An everlasting palace beneath the waves.
[217:22.52]It'll be a sight to see when it's finished.
[217:28.69]Behold, that out the window is the great Blackbird, built by Balthazar, the Guru of Reason.
[217:35.61]To see it soar across the sky, you'd think it alive.
[217:37.87]The Guru is a genius.
[217:47.51]You want me to do anything?
[217:49.85]No, no, you're good.
[217:50.41]You can just chill.
[217:52.01]Okay, I mean, I could fucking hit somebody.
[217:54.05]I could punch somebody.
[217:54.83]I could hit somebody with a fucking wrench.
[217:56.71]No, you're good.
[217:57.79]You can just chill.
[217:58.37]You don't have to say anything else.
[218:00.13]Okay, you just let me know whenever you need me.
[218:04.75]The Blackbird.
[218:07.77]You have, like, five cool emotes.
[218:10.48]No.
[218:11.26]No!
[218:11.80]I need some cool emotes.
[218:14.26]I'm working on it.
[218:16.33]We're gonna get some subscriber value soon, okay?
[218:20.92]I won't just have, like, bald coin.
[218:23.80]And, like, a sour face.
[218:25.32]And, like, a fucking dab emote.
[218:27.58]I have a dab emote.
[218:28.64]Remember when dabbing was in six or seven, eight years ago?
[218:34.04]I have a dab emote.
[218:40.64]All these emotes are, like, relics of the past.
[218:47.01]I like bald coin, though.
[218:48.15]Bald kind's cool.
[218:51.63]Why are you here?
[218:53.61]All is well within the Blackbird, I presume?
[219:00.85]She is fully operational, Lord Dalton.
[219:04.26]Of course she is, you blundering idiot.
[219:07.10]Were she not, we'd all be in trouble.
[219:10.38]You?
[219:11.50]What are you doing there?
[219:14.52]Hmm.
[219:15.30]Those clothes...
[219:17.61]You must be the ones the Prophet said would come to interfere.
[219:20.45]I think I shall watch for the time being and see how he plays his hand.
[219:28.41]Not that I suspect he'll tip his cards so easily.
[219:30.63]Never dreamed a thing so big could fly, hey?
[219:53.12]Go in the cave.
[219:57.28]Can we get a dump truck emote?
[220:00.96]That might be kind of funny.
[220:09.19]But, eh.
[220:15.62]Zeal Palace.
[220:21.45]This is the Queen's Palace, in the center of the Magic Kingdom of Zeal.
[220:26.03]Which is to say, this is the center of the universe.
[220:35.65]The source of our energy rests deep below the sea.
[220:38.01]Once its exact location was determined, we began constructing the Ocean Palace there.
[220:46.47]I think I know what's going on.
[220:48.37]I think I know exactly what's going on here.
[220:52.54]Oh, itchy.
[220:53.94]Could you scratch my back?
[220:57.10]Oh, wonderful.
[220:59.36]Oh, right there.
[221:00.64]You got it.
[221:04.21]Thank you.
[221:06.79]You discovered the news scratching spot.
[221:13.39]How mean.
[221:13.87]Ginkle, why not?
[221:25.93]They say that Gaspar, the guru of time, continues his work on some deserted island.
[221:31.71]He strives to make a time egg or some such nonsense, but no one has seen him in years.
[221:41.03]Oh, this way leads to the mammoth machine chamber.
[221:46.11]Oh, I'm so tired.
[221:50.63]The Prophet's aura is clouded with hatred and sorrow.
[221:53.67]If he does not free himself of these emotions, he'll destroy himself and those he loves along with him.
[222:03.82]Beyond lies the Mammon Machine chamber.
[222:05.56]You can feel the glorious energy of lava surging from it.
[222:11.78]The Mammon Machine?
[222:12.48]You came to see it?
[222:15.22]I did.
[222:16.78]I thought as much.
[222:17.74]Can you feel the flow of the mighty Lavos's power?
[222:20.92]Oh, it brings tears to my eyes.
[222:30.53]This is the font of Zeal's power, the Mammon Machine.
[222:33.96]It draws and magnifies the limitless power of Lavos.
[222:39.39]If the Mammon Machine is moved to the Ocean Palace, we can extract even more energy from Lavos.
[222:45.50]The dream of eternal life will be made possible.
[222:50.83]O Almighty Queen, our kingdom will reign for all eternity.
[223:01.37]Three gurus constructed the Mammon machine from a reddish stone that had been kept in the royal treasury for generations.
[223:08.72]The guru of life, Melchior, was in charge of the plans and conducted a great deal of research on the nature of Lavos.
[223:15.69]But now, well, I'm sure you know the rest.
[223:18.99]We know that guy.
[223:22.19]Operating the Mammon Machine requires magic powerful enough to regulate the energy of machine extracts.
[223:27.96]Excepting the gurus, Lady Shala is the only one with such power.
[223:38.77]Thank God we gave up solar power for the power of Lavos.
[223:42.77]Melchior, the Guru of Life, opposed the Queen's plans and disappeared shortly thereafter.
[223:47.50]It pains me to consider some conspiracy may be at work, but it is terribly suspicious.
[223:56.89]When the man and machine was finished, the queen became a different person almost overnight, a much colder one.
[224:03.18]Just between us, I heard that any who oppose her majesty, and not just the earthbound ones, vanish, and are never heard from again.
[224:11.20]Damn.
[224:22.13]This is kind of messed up.
[224:26.35]Yeah, she likes to dream.
[224:27.19]I like the wind better than dreams.
[224:59.94]What the fuck, dude?
[225:04.14]What is this time shit?
[225:07.87]This way leads to the queen's audience chamber.
[225:13.74]Listen to me.
[225:15.41]The Earth is alive, and always has been.
[225:18.13]She changes slowly, so you never see it.
[225:20.07]From flat lands into mountains, from mountains into seas, a way may someday open even to the Forbidden Shrine in the north, or to the Sun Temple, but it could take years.
[225:41.70]Her Majesty said she had business at the Ocean Palace.
[225:44.56]None may pass until her return.
[225:48.95]Remember these things?
[225:51.83]Some messed up stuff going on.
[225:53.15]This way will take you to the bedchamber.
[226:10.85]Lady Sharla's pendant was made from the same red stone as the Mammon machine.
[226:14.91]When she prays to the device, the pendant glows with an unearthly light.
[226:27.50]Sharla!
[226:29.48]Oh, Janice, you've returned.
[226:30.52]Is something wrong?
[226:31.06]The black winds...
[226:40.92]You feel the foreboding, too?
[226:43.08]Don't worry, it will be alright.
[226:45.74]Here, keep this close.
[226:48.64]What is it?
[226:50.50]It's an amulet containing my prayers.
[226:52.14]If something should happen, it will keep you safe.
[226:56.60]I wish that I could remain with you always, but Mother has other plans.
[227:01.71]That's not our mother.
[227:03.17]She looks like her, but she's not the same inside.
[227:09.91]Even still, forgive me, Janus.
[227:13.43]Pardon your highness.
[227:14.25]The queen requests your immediate presence at the Ocean Palace.
[227:24.46]Very well.
[227:27.10]Well then, Janus, I must be on my way.
[227:31.62]Oh, who might you be?
[227:34.92]Forgive me, my lady, but we must hurry.
[227:36.44]If we're late, I fear I'll be... Well, you know the queen.
[227:40.93]Of course, my apologies.
[227:49.33]Don't waste your time.
[227:50.89]Alphador only likes me.
[227:58.76]Alphador.
[228:01.78]So many of you guys just whipped open a notebook and wrote that down for a cat name.
[228:08.24]And as a tattoo.
[228:18.35]Let's go to the palace.
[228:21.13]The Ocean Palace.
[228:27.65]Got a lot of exposition here.
[228:29.03]Where is it down here?
[228:40.66]When's the next break?
[228:45.82]Uh, like 15 minutes?
[228:49.86]12 minutes?
[228:59.65]Yep.
[229:02.05]I might grab a little sandwich, too.
[229:05.35]Might eat something.
[229:06.11]Uh, let's go.
[229:06.61]How do I get down there?
[229:11.78]How do I get down there?
[229:25.62]Times it right now it is out.
[229:26.66]8 o'clock or so 811 A12.
[229:30.52]Yeah, sandwiches are my favorite food on Earth.
[229:38.99]They're just so easy everything.
[229:48.40]You didn't talk to the boy.
[229:49.50]Wait what?
[229:58.32]Yeah, I did.
[229:58.90]He said, Alphador only talked to me.
[230:01.79]Oh, shit.
[230:04.27]You're right.
[230:09.08]Yep, you're right.
[230:16.74]It's your go-to sandwich sauce.
[230:19.93]I'm a enjoyer of my controller unplugging itself for no reason.
[230:27.71]I was doing this last night too.
[230:37.47]I do like mayo.
[230:38.49]I like... Oh, I saw somebody got... I got a link to me.
[230:43.48]Somebody got my Five Guys order and they said it sucked.
[230:48.82]They said it was mid.
[230:49.72]I was like, what?
[230:52.63]Who?
[230:52.89]How?
[231:03.91]It's a great sandwich.
[231:04.93]It's a great burger.
[231:11.41]Needs more sauce.
[231:14.71]Ask for a little extra.
[231:17.95]You can put mayo on it too and it's just as good.
[231:24.60]I do jalapeños, one patty, cheese, grilled onions, and A1 steak sauce.
[231:37.09]Or I do just lettuce, tomato, mayo.
[231:39.95]Go away.
[231:40.45]I'm glad I came all the way back here for you to do that.
[231:45.79]Go away.
[231:46.25]Okay.
[231:52.32]That sounds like shit.
[231:55.06]You get the tang of the A1.
[231:56.64]You get the tartness of the onions.
[231:59.84]You get the heat.
[232:01.00]The gentle heat from the jalapeños.
[232:03.26]The cheese melts into the bun.
[232:10.68]A1 tastes like shit.
[232:12.58]I only like A1 on this burger.
[232:15.14]Go into the throne room.
[232:16.04]I thought, isn't it blocked?
[232:24.29]I don't like A1 on a steak.
[232:25.83]I only like it on a burger.
[232:27.93]Which is weird.
[232:30.95]True, true, true.
[232:32.09]Oh, true, true.
[232:33.15]Look at all these trues.
[232:33.89]True, true, true.
[232:35.53]That's the most trues I've ever seen.
[232:36.69]Damn.
[232:37.55]True, true, true, true, true.
[232:38.85]Holy shit.
[232:39.53]Nice.
[232:39.79]Thanks, guys.
[232:48.27]Based, based, based.

[233:08.36]I appreciate it.
[233:14.43]We got, oh, the pendant.
[233:16.73]Strange, why no move?
[233:19.03]A mere door binds us hand, foot, and tongue.
[233:29.12]Your pendant, it looks identical to Lady Sharla's.
[233:32.52]I heard that when Lady Sharla communes with the Mammon Machine, her pendant glows with a strange light.
[233:37.91]Let's go.
[233:46.46]hey bro I'm a huge fan just want to see if you have any like advice uh because you're smart and stuff yeah dude I I mean like yeah dude it's now charged we have a charged pendant
[234:09.26]You know there's an ending exclusive to this moment between getting the pendant and charging it up.
[234:15.87]I've heard about this, but I've never done it.
[234:31.42]You just charged up your pendant.
[234:33.30]I did.
[234:42.23]I'll go.
[234:43.44]No, be scared, Crono.
[234:46.02]What trial awaits us next?
[234:54.56]Who are you?
[234:55.86]How did you get in here?
[234:59.57]Your Majesty, these are the bringers of disaster of whom I spoke.
[235:05.51]Indeed, they and the gurus alike.
[235:07.85]How dare you outlandish attempt to oppose me?
[235:12.20]Got him?
[235:12.52]The Ion Sphere halves HP.
[235:13.70]Light me the pot.
[235:45.24]Copies lightning tech.
[235:46.68]Oh, wait.
[235:47.62]I should do fire.
[235:48.17]I should do fire.
[235:49.77]Physical attack.
[235:50.53]That's fine.
[236:01.80]Is he dead?
[236:02.50]This dude is dead?
[236:18.81]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[236:22.38]Hold on.
[236:23.00]He's dead.
[236:26.00]I'm getting fucking destroyed.
[236:31.42]Wait a second.
[236:33.20]We need... I need... I am gonna die.
[236:37.66]Do you have any lapis?
[236:41.67]I need a high potion.
[236:45.39]Had to use it.
[236:51.93]What the fuck?
[236:57.03]You're fucking nuts!
[237:00.64]Whoa!
[237:01.60]Oh, it's because he's doing half HP.
[237:06.56]I gotta get this off of physical right now.
[237:19.31]That's fine, whatever.
[237:20.37]Alright, now I need a big heal.
[237:24.91]GG.
[237:26.53]Oh, she's alive!
[237:28.47]She's alive, okay.
[237:40.04]Okay.
[237:42.10]Any more high potions?
[237:42.90]Um... I'm in trouble.
[237:53.43]I wish I had a... Alright, I lost.
[237:55.11]I don't even know where I saved the game.
[238:00.05]Oh, I scripted.
[238:05.47]Fuck.
[238:06.45]You'd probably get something if you beat it.
[238:13.22]I fear not.
[238:13.90]I won't kill you.
[238:14.68]Not immediately, that is.
[238:16.69]I'll allow you to sample every type of pain and fear imaginable first, but by the time we're through, you'll be begging us to end your suffering.
[238:24.45]Ah, what a delicious diversion.
[238:37.91]Idiots.
[238:39.07]What will you do, Shao?
[238:41.82]Join me, and together we can destroy the Sith.
[239:07.40]Hmm...
[239:38.21]So you came through here...
[240:05.51]Now, Sharla, once I throw them in, you will seal the portal shut.
[240:10.79]No, you can't make me!
[240:13.29]You will obey me.
[240:14.93]Their lives are at stake.
[240:15.81]I... very well.
[240:16.13]Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[240:44.18]Please forgive me.
[240:52.72]Back to the dinosaur world.
[240:54.02]He spared our lives, true enough, but something is amiss.
[241:02.06]They take Lavos power.
[241:03.26]Lavos get weak?
[241:05.68]The emblem upon the door that pendant opened, had you not seen it in other ages before?
[241:11.57]Coming up on a break here.
[241:13.75]But we can bring it to the future.
[241:16.27]A curious crest is engraved here and a mysterious force seals it shut.
[241:34.72]Seems like our only hope.
[241:37.26]Which we will find out after I go get a sandwich.
[241:44.94]I'm going to eat half a sandwich in three minutes.
[244:13.75]Alright, I just sat back down for a second.
[244:15.47]I know the ads are playing, but somebody said that I'll sub after watching this Minecraft movie.
[244:20.53]It looks pretty good.
[244:22.12]But the movie, the commercial of the movie.
[244:33.84]I got a ham.
[244:34.55]I got a ham sandwich.
[244:37.25]Black Forest ham.
[244:38.03]A little bit of mustard.
[244:41.61]White wheat bread.
[244:44.54]Lettuce?
[244:56.05]Any radishes?
[244:56.71]Nah.
[244:56.99]Alright, somebody explain to me, what is black forest ham?
[245:05.82]I mean, it's ham, right?
[245:06.72]But what... I don't get it.
[245:11.59]Explain it to me in detail so I can eat and read what you're saying.
[245:26.70]It's from the Black Forest of Germany?
[245:30.92]What?
[245:32.95]Really?
[245:33.55]It's Jerma ham.
[245:34.43]It means it's from the Black Forest of Germany.
[245:35.83]Oh.
[245:40.01]Dry curing and cold smoking.
[245:42.85]Sounds great.
[245:53.77]Black Forest Cake?
[245:56.68]Huh.
[245:56.88]Yeah, there's cheese on it.
[246:24.43]somebody's got the whole thing salted and seasoned with garlic coriander pepper juniper berries and other spices after curing for two to three weeks the salt is removed and the ham aged an additional two weeks it is then cold smoked using local conifers and sawdust oh I don't want this anymore
[246:55.95]no hey that sawdust tastes great black forest ham it's my favorite I gotta get away from this I can't eat let me get away from this music because it's just looping
[247:32.61]Alright, we know where we gotta go.
[247:33.53]Where are the dactyls?
[247:40.86]Do I get the... I don't want to spoil it, but the cool thing.
[247:52.57]That's soon, right?
[248:22.59]Mm-mm-mm.
[248:23.69]Soon, but not now.
[248:36.51]You ever think about how short this game actually is?
[248:39.77]Um... I mean, for Super Nintendo standards, it's pretty long, I think, for the SNES.
[248:57.60]30 hours.
[248:58.30]That's pretty good for the time period.
[249:04.67]I think it doesn't really overstay its welcome.
[249:06.43]It's exactly what it needs to be.
[249:07.67]Now you want a longer game, you want to go get Chrono Cross.
[249:24.60]That one's about 50.
[249:26.78]Or more.
[249:28.13]It's like 50 or 60, isn't it?
[249:29.37]Ain't nobody going to play that one.
[249:40.59]Then there's all the radical dreamers.
[249:42.52]There's a lot going on.
[249:59.73]I feel like he'd say something, wouldn't he?
[250:08.46]Stop talking with your mouth full.
[250:10.38]I went to the dentist today, guys.
[250:12.58]I didn't want to tell you.
[250:37.28]Hey, what was that sandwich again?
[250:38.20]I was zoned out and want to try it.
[250:40.81]Everyone's gonna hate my fucking sandwich.
[250:43.51]Everyone's gonna hate my order.
[250:56.40]Where's that door?
[250:57.10]I think it's on the other side.
[251:04.12]Food mode!
[251:04.64]This is perfect!
[251:07.71]No, slow down!
[251:08.45]I didn't even take a bite!
[251:10.15]Okay, food mode.
[251:33.75]Let's see if me doing nothing is better than me playing.
[251:42.82]Not really.
[252:09.09]No!
[252:16.49]I'm trying to eat away from the microphone so people don't get disgusted by me.
[252:28.05]I can't even... Wait, I couldn't... That's not...
[252:34.54]What?! !
[252:43.98]Chrono Trigger, more like Boring-O Trigger.
[253:01.47]I've been banning that guy for like THREE WEEKS!
[253:22.65]I'm sorry.
[253:23.05]I got a little carried away.
[253:27.05]What I meant to say was... You can have your opinion of this video game, that's fine.
[253:31.39]I appreciate the opinion.
[253:33.39]But uh... Nah.
[253:56.20]don't speak with your mouth full you I'm spitting sawdust on everybody
[254:12.18]When was the last time you heard somebody scream?
[254:14.46]Well, nobody does that.
[254:16.66]That's a trope.
[254:18.36]I don't think... Imagine being that mad that you scream at somebody with your mouth full like that.
[254:24.23]That just doesn't... And nobody... No human does that.
[254:31.15]Yeah, that's the kind of king... That's king behavior.
[254:33.92]That is... Somebody said tyrant.
[254:34.90]That is a tyrant evil king.
[254:52.54]Where's this door?
[254:54.03]Down?
[255:05.41]Come on.
[255:07.10]Come on.
[255:08.82]Come on.
[255:11.82]Come on.
[255:12.38]There's one back here.
[255:14.12]I know it.
[255:15.94]I knew it.
[255:29.49]Fake gamer alert?
[255:34.15]I'm not, never mind.
[255:35.73]I'm not going to do it again.
[255:52.02]Whoa.
[255:54.80]Ah.
[255:55.86]Fire.
[255:57.38]Fire.
[256:23.59]There it is!
[256:27.82]Wait.
[256:28.06]I can't even get over there.
[256:41.02]Brown noise?
[256:49.94]Could you recreate that?
[256:50.94]I don't think I can.
[257:08.16]I have to get the bridge up.
[257:10.59]I'm sorry.
[257:16.05]I swear some of you weirdos probably put shit like this on to sleep.
[257:23.13]Turn it on.
[257:25.11]What do I have to do?
[257:33.66]It's X-A-B-W-Z-A-B-Y.
[257:40.84]X-Y-B.
[257:45.91]I actually am going to go crazy.
[257:47.13]I have to turn this way down.
[257:52.61]You can hear it in my room.
[257:53.49]Where's my remote control?
[257:55.55]Where's my remote control?
[257:57.09]Where's my remote control?
[258:01.69]It sounds like there's a spaceship hovering over my fucking place.
[258:05.66]Where is the... Where's the remote?
[258:07.86]Oh no, it's in the couch.
[258:09.94]The remote's in the couch.
[258:14.45]It got swallowed by the couch.
[258:40.47]I have to mute.
[258:41.07]Hold on.
[258:52.92]Okay.
[258:54.30]Ah.
[258:55.70]Oh, that's much better.
[258:56.70]Oh, I feel so much better.
[259:01.48]Okay.

[260:30.15]Why?
[260:30.37]Yeah, but it got louder.
[260:31.49]That's weird.
[260:52.04]I got it.

[263:54.71]As long as I'm careful about it.
[263:57.13]Don't do anything stupid and end up, like, choking.
[263:59.17]Don't fucking do that.
[264:00.89]Don't do that.
[264:11.01]I'm a professional e-clown.
[264:12.97]What I do... is what I do.
[264:15.39]Should not be attempted or recreated at home.
[264:20.97]Make sure I have to say that.
[264:27.61]Alright, let's give.
[264:31.73]Golden earring.
[264:32.67]627.
[264:34.05]That's kind of amazing.
[264:36.14]I got something else too.
[264:39.08]The robe.
[264:41.38]Whoa.
[264:43.96]Dang.
[264:45.88]Tons of magic defense too.
[264:53.35]Why do you cover your ass legally?
[265:04.98]Your couch is probably covered in A1 right now.
[265:07.53]You know, I don't put A1 on a Black Forest ham sandwich.
[265:22.90]Sewer?
[265:23.82]Is there one in the sewer?
[265:41.37]There was a bridge here.
[265:42.68]I saw it, I swear.
[265:44.08]What?
[265:47.54]It got up and walked away?
[265:49.66]Don't you lie to me.
[265:50.50]There's nothing here at all.
[265:53.54]But it's true.
[265:56.86]Someone's coming.
[265:57.58]Let's scram.
[266:14.05]This bad place.
[266:14.85]Be careful.
[266:21.89]Cat.
[266:25.44]What'd you do?
[266:26.02]I don't think I'm supposed to be down here right now.
[266:37.29]I think there's like extra stuff.
[266:39.67]But let me see.
[266:42.26]The diary here, the final entry reads as follows.
[266:44.98]I'm through.
[266:45.44]I can't take any more of this.
[266:46.55]The fishmen attack if I make even the slightest noise.
[266:49.03]If I knew things would be like this, I'd have taken the guillotine any day of the week.
[266:55.03]Think I'll go out with a good loud scream.
[266:57.09]See how the soggy freaks like that.
[266:58.85]Damn.
[267:09.66]I don't touch anything.
[267:20.05]I just want to touch the cheese.
[267:22.77]I want to see what happens.
[267:25.26]What's Otto's favorite vegetable?
[267:26.30]Carrots.
[267:27.82]An easy one.
[267:44.03]How would you leave a lasting impression if you were in the guillotine?
[267:46.25]Uh, I would hold a note as long as I could.
[267:59.41]I'm talking even when my head comes off.
[268:00.27]Like I would go eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[268:35.51]You'd run around like a chicken?
[268:36.91]Well, if I'm in a guillotine, I'm not moving around.
[268:43.27]Did I miss something here?
[269:15.38]I want to hear the scream that I did.
[269:36.44]Any plans for my birthday this year?
[269:39.64]No, not that one.
[269:40.20]The other one.
[269:41.72]The one where I went like...
[269:49.41]I don't think this is correct.
[269:54.59]I'll do this later.
[269:55.21]I want to do the... I want to progress a little more.
[270:00.75]Joker left.
[270:01.44]Let me see.
[270:09.68]There's a spaceship hovering over my fucking place.
[270:13.30]Where is the... Where's the remote?
[270:15.51]Oh no, it's in the couch.
[270:17.59]The remote's in the couch.
[270:36.69]I think it's funny.
[270:48.28]Alright, I need to go to... I need to open the other thing down here.
[270:53.27]is it down here?
[271:04.94]boulder toss?
[271:06.22]falcon strike?
[271:07.16]what was that?
[271:12.10]you should subscribe to yourself so you get content like that
[271:23.33]Is that how you laughed when you were getting your head stapled?
[271:26.31]No.
[271:26.57]I mean, actually, maybe.
[271:29.18]Yeah, actually.
[271:30.28]Actually, yeah.
[271:33.00]Now that you mention it, yeah.
[271:59.75]I still have my baby teeth?
[272:01.39]Um, no.
[272:01.71]Alright, I gotta get down.
[272:03.85]Gotta get down.
[272:29.72]I'm excited for the Dark Souls 3 stuff tomorrow.
[272:33.64]Wait, how do I get out of here?
[272:44.79]It's this way.
[272:55.49]Yep, we're doing seamless co-op.
[272:59.30]And I think it's also a randomizer as well.
[273:02.16]So it's gonna be a shitshow.
[273:12.57]Nice.
[273:13.67]Good sneaking.
[273:46.99]Alright, banger dome.
[273:49.15]There's one in here.
[273:50.35]There's one inside of here.
[273:53.51]Oh my goodness.
[274:08.12]A luring top.
[274:12.30]Workman's wallet.
[274:25.12]Turns EXP into G. What?
[274:30.73]That's an alluring top.
[274:35.65]Ooh, success rate of charm.
[274:41.07]It's a gold farming item?
[274:42.09]Ooh, cool.
[274:42.45]Okay.
[274:42.63]Okay.
[274:55.79]I don't really need it right now.
[274:57.77]But that's cool to have.
[274:58.57]Alright, this is definitely where I need to be.
[275:10.74]Absolutely.
[275:13.77]Any cash?
[275:14.35]Yes.
[275:19.73]I got plenty of mid potions.
[275:22.77]Yeah, I got plenty.
[275:23.25]I got everything.
[275:23.85]I'm good.
[275:38.85]their golden stud a magic capsule golden stud so maybe it is in the sewers reduces mp consumption by 75 percent so you just never run a man ever
[276:08.68]It's actually crazy.
[276:13.26]Okay, so... Where is it?
[276:16.46]Maybe I should go talk to Belkir.
[276:22.72]Oh, that's right.
[276:23.08]The black boxes.
[276:29.22]Where is the right place?
[276:35.22]Go back in the sewer.
[276:44.44]It actually is the sewers.
[276:48.18]Oh shit.
[276:52.73]Shit.
[277:01.11]Did you believe in the tooth fairy as a kid?
[277:02.43]I did.
[277:17.95]I also believed in Santa.
[277:20.47]I believed in pretty much everything.
[277:23.36]That you could believe in.
[277:33.48]I did get my wisdom teeth removed.
[277:35.22]They're no longer there.
[277:36.08]That was a long time ago.
[277:42.48]That was when I was like.
[277:44.88]19 or something.
[277:46.80]Like 19 or 20.
[278:11.01]Alright.
[278:13.59]Go back down to the sewer.
[278:40.58]I got some good items though.
[278:41.44]Apparently I missed a hidden path.
[279:09.32]Kill.
[279:10.14]Is there a hidden path here?
[279:19.14]Because I went down this one.
[279:43.56]That turns that on.
[279:49.16]You're so loud.
[279:49.76]Turn your microphone down.
[279:54.74]What?
[279:55.34]Do you go from here and go down?
[280:02.12]Hey, there it is.
[280:15.19]We're good.
[280:21.01]Looks like you just have to press this switch and the bridge will extend across.
[280:23.89]Ribbit.
[280:24.21]So, switch it on already.
[280:31.58]I can't reach it.
[280:33.84]And you call yourself a frog, Ribbit.
[280:37.00]Someone's coming.
[280:37.80]Let's scram.
[280:54.28]That seems kind of good.
[280:57.32]Yes, yes we will!
[281:19.66]Play the sound that I did earlier I love how he just walks off, that's funny
[281:49.95]Boulder Toss, that's a new move.
[281:59.69]Damn, that's pretty strong for one solo move.
[282:15.85]That was easy.
[282:30.51]Spill the screen with lightning.
[282:31.89]Everybody dead?
[282:38.82]Yep.
[282:39.54]You could farm gold down here too.
[282:48.90]I could.
[282:49.28]I got a lot of money though.
[282:50.92]I haven't really spent very much.
[282:51.90]I should probably save it for a little while.
[283:02.53]Thunder Blade.
[283:07.41]Not as good as what I have right now.
[283:09.94]Still cool.
[283:17.16]Shortcut.
[283:18.94]Nice.
[283:27.38]Death Peak.
[283:30.04]Keeper's Dome.
[283:31.45]That's it, right?
[283:38.71]The pendant begins to glow.
[284:08.49]Hmm?
[284:12.81]You who have opened the door, I am Balthazar, the Guru of Reason, and formerly of the Kingdom of Zeal.
[284:19.67]I was cast into this era by a great disaster which befell our land.
[284:23.97]Much to my surprise, I have learned that the creature Lavos was not a product of our age, far from it.
[284:30.01]It seems that the being fell from the sky in a bygone age, pouring deep into the planet's core.
[284:35.83]There he began to feed upon its energy, growing ever stronger.
[284:45.32]Lavos' form was revealed briefly when he was summoned forth by a mighty wizard by the name of Magus in the year 600.
[284:51.17]In the year 1999, Lavos emerged to claim the surface.
[284:57.97]Now he has taken the place I've named Death Peak as his throne or nest, as it may well be.
[285:05.98]His miniature spawn now flow from the mountaintop, an avalanche of death.
[285:13.21]Lavos is a parasite, a parasite of gargantuan proportions whose host is the planet itself.
[285:19.19]Trapped here, I endeavor to continue my study and observation of Lavos, but I believe the end draws near.
[285:30.16]Maintaining one's sanity is an endeavor in and of itself in an age such as this, an endeavor I fear I may be futile.
[285:37.83]But before my end is here and my mind is lost forever, I have decided to leave these records of my knowledge behind, along with my greatest invention.
[285:52.02]Ever did I long to return home and toil endlessly in search of a way.
[285:56.08]But as I neared the completion of my research, so did I near the end of my days.
[286:01.33]I've grown old and frail, and so I leave it in your hands.
[286:05.59]You, who have opened the way.
[286:08.46]Take hold the reins of time, and let all the people of this planet's past and future join as one.
[286:13.86]Then, only then, you just may be able to stop Lavos.
[286:20.57]Let's gooo, everybody get pogged up!
[286:53.13]There it is.
[286:59.48]This must be it.
[287:00.96]The wings of time.
[287:04.04]Oh, what this thing?
[287:18.32]How do I use it?
[287:19.32]I must ponder its use.
[287:36.83]Ah, yes.
[287:59.86]That is correct.
[288:04.18]Oh, I know how to do it.
[288:37.05]get in wait do we get the song?
[288:51.27]End of time, cataclysm, present, middle ages, antiquity, or prehistory.
[289:39.62]Let's go!
[289:41.42]What is this?
[289:43.61]This is great!
[289:44.33]Fast, fast!
[289:46.47]The Epoch is capable of this?
[289:47.81]I love that.
[289:58.22]Hey!
[290:05.46]Ah, yeah, now we go.
[290:06.86]Now we go.
[290:35.41]Alright, I'm using them.
[290:37.65]It's time.
[290:41.69]I know that we're going to have Isla.
[290:44.43]I know we're going to have Chrono.
[290:45.29]I know we're going to have Frog.
[290:51.00]Strength on Isla.
[290:52.62]Magic on Frog.
[290:53.72]I think I'm going to go all in on Magic for Frog.
[291:12.78]Because he will be effectively the healer.
[291:17.30]All in on Chrono.
[291:19.78]I don't know.
[291:20.72]I don't know.
[291:23.30]Maybe I'll give strength to Chrono.
[291:28.95]Split magic on them.
[291:35.43]Everything on Chrono is good.
[291:45.83]Alright.
[291:50.36]I'm afraid to use the rest.
[291:51.26]What about speed?
[291:52.84]I think I'm going to give speed to Isla.
[291:55.14]Or maybe speed to Frog?
[292:03.82]Frog's magic is crap overall.
[292:05.32]He has some really good heals though, doesn't he?
[292:09.84]Speed caps at 15.
[292:19.38]I'll give it to Frog then.
[292:21.72]This team sucks.
[292:25.59]Well, it's not necessarily my team.
[292:27.47]Do you want Chrono fast?
[292:31.15]I'll give one to Chrono.
[292:33.15]This might not be my team.
[292:36.87]Possible.
[292:49.54]Strategizing over the baby game.
[292:51.46]You can farm speed tabs later anyways.
[293:01.13]I'll give it to Frog.
[293:06.03]He needs it.
[293:06.31]Look at showing my bias.
[293:18.00]I used him.
[293:23.56]It's over.
[293:26.38]Chrono's magic is really good.
[293:28.52]But I don't know how much... I don't know.
[293:30.60]You know, I don't know.
[293:31.22]Alright, let's do this bit.
[293:35.35]And then after this, this is probably going to be... I'll take one more break and then we'll play out this section and then probably end the stream.
[293:50.07]Isla cannot learn magic, unfortunately.
[293:54.58]I can't learn it.
[294:08.10]Sealed.
[294:12.40]Really, it's sealed.
[294:42.77]This is Algedi, the village of the earthbound.
[294:48.74]We earthbound ones were banished from Zeal because we are possessed of no magical talents.
[295:00.90]You want some goods?
[295:02.76]Whoa.
[295:03.92]Zenmato.
[295:07.26]17 grand.
[295:07.92]This is better than the Massamune.
[295:30.22]that's all my money it's all gone I gotta sell some damage one and a half times to magical beings damn okay she's got a good look at her defense it's insane
[296:09.10]I think I want this for the magic.
[296:11.32]It's just a piece of crap.
[296:12.04]I'll just sell it.
[296:14.56]Bandit's bow.
[296:15.33]I'm not going to be using Marl.
[296:18.89]Not using Robo right now.
[296:19.87]Not using this.
[296:24.65]Not using this.
[296:28.41]Not using this.
[296:40.17]This is worth a lot.
[296:41.71]Oh, I got some money though.
[296:42.53]It's okay.
[296:44.49]Radiant plate.
[296:46.23]Yep.
[296:47.35]I'll take... I want two of these.
[296:50.76]Shit, I need to sell everything.
[296:52.08]I want a bunch of those.
[296:56.82]I'll sell the mist robes.
[296:58.94]I'm not going to use them.
[297:04.80]Iron suit.
[297:05.24]Get rid of it.
[297:05.96]Titanium vest.
[297:07.06]Get rid of it.
[297:10.10]Titanium Vest, get rid of it.
[297:11.70]Bronze Armor, get rid of it.
[297:14.66]Stone Helm, get rid of it.
[297:16.96]Golden Helm, get rid of it.
[297:18.64]Iron Helm, dump, dump.
[297:23.94]This is 10 grand, the full heal.
[297:33.09]Alright, I got one radiant plate.
[297:35.57]I want another one.
[297:37.37]And then I want two radiant helms.
[297:39.38]We are good to go.
[297:49.26]There's no way I'm dying now.
[297:51.87]I saved that money for so long.
[297:53.15]Might as well use it.
[298:00.87]Alright, she's good.
[298:07.51]What's up with the ominous empty space for another party member?
[298:12.78]Ominous, isn't it?
[298:16.00]Many inhabitants of this land were taken to build the Ocean Palace and none were ever seen again.
[298:29.60]The Queen has installed the Mammon Machine in the Ocean Palace in an attempt to absorb Lavos's energy.
[298:34.31]But is there not peril in such a thing?
[298:37.57]The Guru of Life said as much, but it only led her to imprison him upon the Mountain of Woe.
[298:42.15]There is little we can do.
[298:47.01]The Guru of Life said that young Lord Janus possessed power within him exceeding even that of Lady Shala.
[298:52.96]But then the Queen lost her mind.
[298:55.76]That young Lord grew to hate that power and all the suffering it causes Lady Shala.
[299:01.33]Now he hides it, denies it, and shuts it from his thoughts.
[299:15.73]When will Lady Shala come and play with us?
[299:18.31]The three gurus and Lady Shala are near the only ones who do not treat us as inferior.
[299:34.61]The mud beast den is dangerous.
[299:36.39]You shouldn't play around here.
[299:42.25]Would you like to rest?
[299:43.62]Sure.
[299:53.23]Not since Lavos, unfortunately.
[299:58.27]Break the seal.
[300:19.15]Guru of life voiced opposition to the queen's plan, and so he was banished to the Mountain of Woe.
[300:22.89]Yep, Mountain of Woe.
[300:24.99]This tunnel connects to a mud beast den, and beyond the mouth of the den lies the great chain that anchors the Mountain of Woe to the Earth.
[300:34.14]We're going to hit our last break of the evening and go from there.
[300:41.24]Give that to Isla.
[300:44.25]You know what?
[300:44.59]Give it to Crono.
[300:46.39]No, give it to Isla.
[301:01.12]Last break.
[301:02.88]We will play out this section here and then I will call it and we'll see you tomorrow for Dark Souls 3.
[301:07.34]That's going to play in about 30 seconds.
[301:13.45]I will be right back.
[306:20.57]Hello.
[306:29.26]Okay, so I've got confirmation.
[306:32.17]We're going to try to do the Dark Souls 3 seamless co-op stuff.
[306:38.05]Tomorrow around like 1.30, 2 Pacific.
[306:39.69]Around like 2-ish.
[306:53.90]Just talk to the, uh... talk to the boss, you know?
[307:02.97]Cool purple sword.
[307:11.45]That move is really good.
[307:23.60]Were you on your phone?
[307:24.32]Yeah, I was on my phone.
[307:25.00]I was just checking.
[307:25.94]Checking to see, like, the scores of the game.
[307:27.38]I gotta see what my team's doing.
[307:44.17]What team?
[307:44.91]Um, you know, the... The...
[307:53.60]Boston um Boston boogers you know we got a pretty good team this year that's some good pics yeah they did
[308:28.42]More like Rono trigger because the game sucks.
[308:34.52]You took the whole BRB to make that one up.
[308:45.82]Which I get it.
[308:46.58]I get it.
[308:47.41]He's trying to come up with, you know, something crazy.
[308:51.03]Funny.
[308:53.53]You're not getting through here.
[308:55.63]Oh shit.
[308:56.01]Oh my god.
[308:56.39]This is a boss fight.
[308:59.76]I was not ready for this.
[309:07.34]The little guy.
[309:12.08]OK.
[309:12.46]Uh, water on the red one.
[309:14.60]God leave him alone.
[309:18.62]Jeez.
[309:33.13]Jeez!
[309:33.47]That was dead.
[309:46.04]That's actually a lot better with the magic points now.
[310:09.09]Not bad.
[310:12.13]Shit, he's dead again.
[310:12.95]No!
[310:13.97]Thanks.
[310:15.02]He's attacking twice.
[310:43.62]There we go.
[310:44.18]Big damage, good.
[311:15.14]How long are you asleep for?
[311:18.02]Until you get attacked or is it like a few turns or something?
[311:20.43]I wonder if it's not worth even using the... you know, items on it.
[311:44.01]Oh, you little rascals.
[311:55.32]Still not dead.
[312:03.50]I usually sleep until I get attacked too.
[312:13.91]Oh, that's funny.
[312:21.04]Oh, I die!
[312:22.02]Die!
[312:38.72]No, don't heal.
[312:39.48]Alright, kill the little weirdo back there.
[313:11.01]Alright, the blue one has to be getting pretty close, right?
[313:16.26]How'd you do that?
[313:16.78]Double it up.
[313:46.84]Those of us that are waiting to sleep, can you do a lullaby?
[313:48.96]Uh, yeah, sure.
[313:56.80]I was going to just scream into the microphone.
[314:00.48]But I can't do that right now.
[314:01.80]That would be so awful.
[314:11.06]If it wasn't this late, I may have done that.
[314:13.77]Maybe.
[314:13.95]Maybe.
[314:29.91]This will do a lot, I think.
[314:30.95]I'm looking for 1,000.
[314:33.07]1,000 damage.
[314:33.31]Game stinks.
[314:33.61]Let's do that.
[315:02.02]Again.
[315:02.28]Gonna do the lightning thunder chomp on the little guy.
[315:20.37]Who does Isla have a triple technique with?
[315:26.64]Does Isla have any triple techniques?
[315:28.20]Everybody has one, right?
[315:37.73]Is it Luka and Maro?
[315:41.46]Robo and Chrono.
[315:42.62]Robo, Chrono, and Kylo.
[315:49.41]Stop healing them.
[316:07.58]What about sunflowers?
[316:08.20]Are you going to grow some this year?
[316:09.06]Yeah, actually, we have a lot of stuff this year.
[316:12.16]I'm going to do sunflowers.
[316:16.40]The seeds are alright here.
[316:17.80]I can take a look and see what's over there.
[316:24.21]Alright, that's dead.
[316:30.55]Yes.
[316:40.51]What is this guy weak to?
[316:42.97]Just regular attacks?
[316:52.72]Spam healer.
[316:57.75]Stop spamming!
[317:27.57]There we go.
[317:28.67]Okay.
[317:30.79]That guy was annoying.
[317:34.19]Need new techniques?
[317:40.11]I think so.
[317:42.29]You going?
[317:42.83]Get up there.
[318:00.49]I think this is where... I'm gonna call it here.
[318:04.23]It's a good place to start.
[318:16.50]This is... we're getting to about the last third of the game.
[318:21.12]There is still a ton of content to do.
[318:23.04]Some of the harder, more challenging things are actually coming up in the next third of the game.
[318:29.85]There's a lot of side content that I want to do.
[318:35.94]So we'll do it again.
[318:39.56]Raze.
[318:40.18]I think that's a resurrect.
[319:05.37]There we go.
[319:07.93]We're locked and loaded, ready to go for when we play it again.
[319:11.53]I don't know how long Steri and I are going to do Dark Souls 3 tomorrow, but I'm sure we're going to do it for probably at least 3 to 5 hours.
[319:18.06]It's going to be a crazy day.
[319:20.78]Starting around 2 o'clock Pacific, 1.30ish, probably 2.
[319:23.82]We're going to have technical problems, you know we will.
[319:30.61]Yeah.
[319:33.23]That is it for tonight.
[319:34.03]Thanks everybody.
[319:36.39]Credits are there.
[319:37.63]Thanks for subbing.
[319:38.30]Appreciate it.
[319:39.46]Thanks for hanging out.
[319:40.32]Thanks for participating.
[319:48.91]Wanted to get some more Chrono Trigger under the belt.
[320:05.59]You gonna go play Robocop?
[320:06.67]It's a good game.
[320:07.31]You should play it.
[320:22.36]I am gonna get a little bit of sleep.
[320:25.78]Wake up and probably get... Yeah, I think tomorrow's gonna be a lot of fun.
[320:32.94]Today was fun too.
[320:35.23]See you soon.
[320:35.91]Take care of yourselves.
[320:36.65]Call your mother.
[320:37.21]You know the drill.
[320:37.99]This is, I'm doing the pilot thing again.
[320:41.11]Okay.
[320:41.31]So see you tomorrow.
[320:42.44]Okay.
[320:43.72]Take care.
