[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.79]Good afternoon.
[00:03.06]What's up?
[00:07.34]We are playing a video game today.
[00:09.18]We're playing Scribblenauts today.
[00:13.60]Yep, I know, a ton of people just freaked out.
[00:16.67]This is some of your favorite, some of your guys' favorite video game.
[00:22.75]I know that for a fact.
[00:27.39]You know, it's been plenty of people over the last few years that have said, dude, please.
[00:34.61]Scribblenauts is so much fun.
[00:36.30]You would love it.
[00:37.98]Play it.
[00:38.52]Do it.
[00:39.60]Play it, motherfucker.
[00:40.70]Play the fucking game I want you to play.
[00:42.58]And I'm like, alright, maybe.
[00:49.24]And today we're gonna play it.
[00:50.79]We had some voting.
[00:51.95]I'm very early, yes.
[00:53.51]I was up early today.
[00:56.38]So I just was like, you know what?
[00:57.46]I'm ready.
[00:58.02]I'm ready to go.
[00:58.64]Let's go.
[01:00.86]Just start like an hour or two from now, but I decided to pull it back.
[01:05.28]He was up at 5 a.m.
[01:06.96]Yeah.
[01:08.88]I was up at 5 o'clock in the morning reading my favorite newspaper.
[01:14.11]Pre-stream chat.
[01:19.83]You guys know that I use pre-stream chat as my morning coffee routine?
[01:26.16]You guys are way funnier than Garfield, and you're way more interesting than Dilbert.
[01:33.44]Plus, like, the crazy shit, you can't say half the crazy shit you guys say.
[01:38.18]I'm like... Foxtrot.
[01:41.12]Garfield rules.
[01:57.53]I mean, I don't hate Garfield, but I just... Pre-stream chat is more interesting.
[02:07.69]Okay, would you rather watch Garfield eat a lasagna or watch 400 people yell at each other over the game that we're going to play today?
[02:16.33]I just sit here and I'm like, oh, this is gonna be good.
[02:27.84]Revolt.
[02:28.45]Revolt.
[02:32.89]Can you write the debt out?
[02:34.61]I don't know what you mean.
[02:39.01]It's our amusement.
[02:40.83]He's using us for his amusement.
[02:49.79]We're gonna play Scribblenauts.
[02:50.71]I actually have played... I played... I don't think I've ever played Scribblenauts.
[02:55.60]I played the other one.
[02:57.68]The DS.
[02:59.22]Like 10 years ago.
[03:00.26]15 years ago.
[03:03.08]What came out on DS?
[03:05.76]Brawn to Life.
[03:06.54]I think that's the one that I played.
[03:14.30]But I guess you draw characters and they come to life in this game?
[03:20.44]I actually almost made the title of this stream drawing to life or like drawing drawn to life.
[03:25.80]I almost said that.
[03:33.27]It's a different game.
[03:35.59]No, not draw my life.
[03:39.55]I did one of those as grandpa.
[03:42.01]Does that video still exist?
[03:46.27]Did I delete it?
[03:53.58]I think it still exists.
[03:54.57]I don't think I've deleted that one.
[03:56.95]It's still up?
[03:57.65]Yeah, I think it is still up.
[04:00.99]Peaceful Hayley, thanks for the five community subs.
[04:03.51]Thank you, Hayley.
[04:06.31]Five subs.
[04:13.98]Pog Hayley, Pog Hayley.
[04:17.88]Watch it, it's awful.
[04:21.29]Deleted on stream.
[04:22.33]Is it that bad?
[04:23.15]I don't remember it.
[04:23.85]Now, we're playing Scribblenauts.
[04:27.26]This does not embarrass me from my old videos today.
[04:31.34]Will you ever come to Brazil?
[04:33.62]Um, probably not.
[04:36.24]I've never left North America in my life.
[04:43.26]I'm probably never going to leave North America.
[04:45.42]You know, I want to go to Japan.
[04:47.62]Man, I sure would love to go to Tokyo.
[04:49.76]Oh, England sounds so cool.
[04:51.14]I want to go to Ireland.
[04:53.42]No, I'm just too... I don't want to go anywhere.
[04:59.69]Who doesn't want to go to Japan?
[05:02.13]Or Tokyo?
[05:02.69]Really?
[05:04.99]It's an incredibly interesting place.
[05:10.51]You don't need to like...
[05:12.17]Japanese cartoons to want to go to an incredibly, incredibly rich cultural, incredible historical area.
[05:31.20]Shut up, you're a weeb.
[05:33.08]You know what?
[05:35.63]Just for that comment, just for that comment, I'm watching One Punch Man Season 2 starting tonight.
[05:40.53]Just for that comment.
[05:41.75]For that comment alone, I'm gonna start Episode 1 tonight.
[05:49.36]And I know that it sucks.
[05:51.92]I know that it's way worse than Season 1, but look what you did.
[05:54.90]Look what you've done.
[06:00.02]Everybody says, oh, it's a new, it's a different animation studio.
[06:02.44]It sucks.
[06:04.12]Too bad.
[06:04.96]I'm gonna watch it now.
[06:08.70]Sorry, Jerma, you're going to Brazil.
[06:10.40]Wait, what?
[06:16.37]Sorry.
[06:17.79]Sorry, dude, but you're going.
[06:23.75]What?
[06:24.37]That's like scary.
[06:26.47]What you just said was scary.
[06:27.85]Okay.
[06:32.78]Time to play the game.
[06:35.04]No, it's time to do the pre-live.
[06:40.16]No, what would this be called?
[06:43.68]The hanging out before the cast.
[06:47.36]This is the pre-stream.
[06:49.84]Which again, I have to make this really clear.
[06:51.62]A lot of you guys... Pre-stream is essentially the Jerma Congress.
[06:57.62]I saw that meme and it's real.
[07:01.84]How many people are in Congress?
[07:02.86]200?
[07:02.88]300?
[07:04.90]It's 400-something, right?
[07:05.92]Like 500?
[07:06.12]435?
[07:06.14]Okay.
[07:06.30]There are like 410 people in pre-stream chat.
[07:26.00]that decide a ton of things.
[07:28.59]So, I mean, if you want to be part of the Jerma Congress, you've got a lot of sway in that, like, you know, two, three, four hours before a stream happens.
[07:45.53]Pre-stream chat ending waiting room.
[07:49.61]Pre-stream chat holds too much power.
[07:54.31]Impeach this guy.
[07:58.02]Call the house speaker.
[08:00.22]Who would the house speaker of pre-stream chat be?
[08:02.23]Now that's a whole can of worms I'm not going to get into.
[08:05.21]Do you want to start a fight?
[08:08.33]That's how you just started one.
[08:15.39]Do not.
[08:18.74]Let end stream chat decide something for once.
[08:24.81]You know?
[08:25.09]Damn.
[08:28.05]That is true.
[08:29.09]That is absolutely, positively accurate.
[08:32.69]And I'll tell you why.
[08:33.39]Pre-stream chat is here and ready for the stream.
[08:38.71]And they're here sometimes two, three, four hours before I even start.
[08:42.89]Right?
[08:44.39]Post-stream chat stuck around the whole time.
[08:48.45]And they were here to the end.
[08:51.59]They were dedicated.
[08:53.87]Hmm.
[08:54.39]That means they deserve to be rewarded.
[09:00.19]Okay.
[09:04.89]Post stream chat today.
[09:06.03]Going to decide the next stream.
[09:09.51]There you go.
[09:11.67]Watch this.
[09:12.19]It's like the highest view count I've ever had today.
[09:15.09]I'm staying.
[09:15.75]He's playing Sly Cooper tomorrow.
[09:22.13]Not streaming tomorrow.
[09:23.81]But, you know.
[09:26.03]It's like 40,000 concurrent viewers here.
[09:28.55]Oh, I'm going to tell him.
[09:29.99]He's going to play Immortal Redneck.
[09:36.72]Alright, let's go.
[09:37.18]Is this capping or what?
[09:45.32]Got nice music, but where's the cap?
[09:48.94]Where's my capture?
[09:50.85]Dog Yelp just gave five community subs.
[09:52.53]Thank you, Dog Yelp.
[09:56.29]Thanks a lot.
[09:58.06]You guys ready to get started?
[09:59.24]You guys ready to get started?
[10:01.54]Hey, are you guys ready to get started?
[10:05.36]Immortal Redneck was a good stream.
[10:06.68]It was a really good game, too.
[10:10.28]It was very good.
[10:10.92]It was really fun.
[10:11.44]There was like two that came out bad.
[10:12.92]There was Immortal Redneck and then there was, um... What was the one that I played?
[10:17.83]City of something?
[10:20.73]City of something.
[10:25.49]It's like City of Egypt or something.
[10:28.07]With like the same game, but kind of different.
[10:30.01]City of Brass.
[10:30.95]Oh, that was it.
[10:31.35]Okay.
[10:35.30]Stop stalling.
[10:38.04]I'm not stalling.
[10:38.86]I'm about to start.
[10:50.17]Huge bits.
[10:51.83]Oh, that's a lot.
[10:52.91]That's a lot.
[10:55.11]I forgot to update my rules.
[10:56.49]Alright, we're gonna slowly pan this out.
[10:58.21]This is somebody's birthday.
[10:59.33]Hold on, it's somebody's birthday today.
[11:00.53]I have... It's somebody's little brother's birthday, okay?
[11:06.78]And excuse me, it's somebody's birthday!
[11:10.94]Or little sibling, sorry.
[11:12.22]I don't know why I said little brother.
[11:13.64]Little sibling's birthday today.
[11:15.02]Hey, crows.
[11:19.04]Q Rose crows happy birthday We're talking about your birthday crows Have a good one That's from sparkly pantsuit sparkly pantsuit I'm gonna make that very very very quick We need to all say happy birthday
[11:43.10]That's huge bits.
[11:44.02]That's an insane amount of money.
[11:46.44]I will reiterate again.
[11:48.78]I'm probably going to turn bits off.
[11:55.68]It's too much money to give me.
[12:00.65]But thank you nonetheless and happy birthday to crows.
[12:03.57]Only time.
[12:05.23]I didn't update the rules.
[12:07.51]I forgot.
[12:07.91]I was going to do that earlier this morning.
[12:11.60]You're gonna ban your own income.
[12:13.24]No, I'm not banning my own income.
[12:15.06]They say he really loves your streams and we often watch together.
[12:22.34]Well, happy birthday.
[12:23.18]Thank you.
[12:26.68]Thank you so much.
[12:27.27]Alright, everyone.
[12:29.83]I'm starting.
[12:30.47]Oh, it's voice acting!
[12:31.75]Reba!
[12:32.03]Reba!
[12:36.21]You might not believe this, but Grandpa Edgar used to be the world's greatest adventurer.
[12:41.33]Grandma Julie would beg to differ.
[12:43.93]She was also an adventurer.
[12:46.58]Edgar would often brush away vines or open doors thought to be undisturbed for generations, only to find Julie was already there, having lunch.
[12:56.92]They competed like this on adventure after adventure.
[13:03.89]On one adventure,
[13:05.27]Julie beat Edgar to the top of a long lost pyramid.
[13:08.04]I'm kidding, man.
[13:09.02]Relax.
[13:10.10]This is like the first kid's book.
[13:11.68]I haven't even played part of the game.
[13:15.17]The two of them semi-retired to start a family.
[13:18.57]And they continued starting that family until they had 42 children.
[13:23.50]Alright, settle down.
[13:25.84]One day, Mom and Dad gave Maxwell and me two amazing gifts.
[13:31.08]The first was a magic wand that let you travel anywhere in the world.
[13:36.43]The second was the most amazing notebook.
[13:39.93]This notebook let you write any word in it.
[13:43.19]And poof, the word would come to life.
[13:54.83]Our parents were worried about us turning out to these spoiled little brats, so they sent us out to face the challenges of the outside world.
[14:04.37]On the road to the city, we ran into an old man who said he was hungry.
[14:11.41]Maxwell made something to give him, but he played a nasty trick.
[14:17.78]The apple was rotten, while the old man spat it out as soon as he tasted it and was very, very angry.
[14:25.21]As he cast some sort of magic, he called us spoiled little kids and then disappeared.
[14:32.59]Didn't seem like anything had happened.
[14:34.93]But when Maxwell turned to continue down the road, I couldn't follow him.
[14:39.09]The old man had put a curse on me that was turning me to stone.
[14:42.28]What?
[14:43.24]We didn't know what to do.
[14:44.94]Luckily, our brother Edwin's farm was nearby.
[14:48.94]Oh boy, you should have seen how angry Edwin was.
[14:51.94]He couldn't believe what we did to the old man and said we probably deserved what we got.
[14:58.02]Lucky for us, Edwin knew about starites.
[15:02.74]Starites are magical objects born out of the happiness of others.
[15:07.88]When you do enough things to make others happy, you will find starite.
[15:14.02]Just write money in there.
[15:14.96]Just fuck up the whole economy.
[15:16.18]Just inflate all currency.
[15:17.14]Just write like five trillion dollars in cash on there.
[15:51.98]It said, didn't you... Important question.
[15:54.14]Didn't you admit multiple times you're an awful speller?
[15:56.19]This game requires spelling.
[15:57.67]Well, that's what I have you guys here for.
[15:59.65]To help me.
[16:02.43]Why is my screen all messed up?
[16:06.45]Game crash?
[16:11.74]Game crash?
[16:16.32]Um... Ow.
[16:21.56]Ow.
[16:24.19]I can't even close the game.
[16:25.11]I can't.
[16:29.17]No, I did something.
[16:30.51]I can't close the game.
[16:31.71]I have to open up the task manager?
[16:35.76]Scribble32 is not responding.
[16:40.94]Oh, okay.
[16:45.66]Well, let's open it back up.
[16:51.70]This is Scribblenauts Unlimited, by the way.
[16:54.36]Those of you that think I'm playing on the standard version for the Nintendo DS, nope.
[17:01.86]Nope.
[17:06.97]Get a bunch of not-safe-for-work mods.
[17:10.39]Um, you want me to take, like, a two-week vacation from Twitch?
[17:16.53]Skip.
[17:19.71]Okay, here we go.
[17:20.93]This is fine.
[17:23.20]There's Farmer Dan.
[17:24.72]Farmer Dan wants, walk to the farmer.
[17:27.05]Okay.
[17:33.07]He's doing it.
[17:33.59]Okay.
[17:34.99]Hi.
[17:36.47]What can I do for you?
[17:37.35]Click on Edwin.
[17:39.09]The basics.
[17:39.69]Earn a star right by helping Edwin with his award winning pig.
[17:42.98]Okay.
[17:45.28]Okay.
[17:50.81]Turn the runt of the litter into an award-winning pig.
[17:53.49]Write an object to help Maxwell scrub the pig.
[17:57.31]Use the notepad.
[17:58.17]Type something to clean the pig.
[18:01.82]Uh... Bathtub.
[18:19.92]So.
[18:23.51]Oh, this is cool.
[18:24.53]Okay.
[18:25.33]Here, take it.
[18:27.51]Oh, I'm Maxwell.
[18:29.17]And then now use the object to clean the pig.
[18:31.39]Clean the pig!
[18:33.62]Click the progress bar for the current hint.
[18:40.96]Click Matt.
[18:41.42]Remove this object.
[18:42.34]Okay.
[18:45.76]Drag it to the trash can.
[18:49.18]Pig looks great.
[18:49.90]Now use an adjective to increase the pig's size.
[18:53.51]Okay, an adjective.
[18:56.75]I have an adjective to increase the pig's size.
[19:01.92]Gargantuan.
[19:04.64]Got it.
[19:06.16]Help the pig win the talent competition.
[19:08.08]Use an adjective and a noun to create wings large enough to carry the pig.
[19:14.66]Big wings, okay.
[19:18.90]Inns are unlocked over time.
[19:23.82]I need wings large enough to help me fly.
[19:25.63]Well, I have to use it.
[19:34.19]Oh, okay.
[19:34.81]Here we go.
[19:37.25]Create object.
[19:38.59]I need wings large.
[19:39.35]How about big wings?
[19:44.52]The magic backpack stores objects for later.
[19:46.88]Throw the wings in the backpack and wait for the judges to arrive.
[19:57.47]Just big wings.
[19:59.67]Very uncreative.
[20:01.23]What is this tutorial?
[20:02.15]I don't know how to play.
[20:05.41]Take the wings from the magic backpack.
[20:09.14]And then put them on the pig and then watch pigs fly.
[20:11.86]Is that Sims?
[20:13.62]What did I just do?
[20:14.92]The Sims, right?
[20:27.55]That's the movies, right?
[20:28.42]The movies.
[20:28.78]You got it.
[20:34.64]He's about to crack him over the head.
[20:36.64]Oh, okay.
[20:37.08]We're good.
[20:38.64]Oh, I got a star bright.
[20:47.93]You completed the basics.
[20:49.31]Welcome to Scribblenauts.
[20:54.80]Okay, earn shards by helping people.
[20:56.50]Ten shards will form a starrite.
[20:58.34]Use starrite vision to find shards.
[21:01.35]You guys can help me with that later, I don't care.
[21:04.93]Click golden objects for hints.
[21:06.33]Okay, so he needs something else.
[21:07.81]Help the sprout grow.
[21:11.40]Alright, let's go.
[21:12.30]Okay, help the sprout grow.
[21:13.60]Water.
[21:13.90]No.
[21:17.28]Manure.
[21:17.68]How do you spell manure?
[21:20.76]Manure?
[21:20.94]Manure?
[21:28.29]Oh my god, I was gonna kill this guy.
[21:29.40]What happened?
[21:31.54]What happened?
[21:32.60]I did it.
[21:32.88]Okay.
[21:33.10]Put that in your backpack.
[21:37.56]The plant scared away the other shard opportunity.
[21:40.24]Reset the level to return... I got the bad ending?
[21:49.35]So wait, that thing kills the town?
[21:51.11]I have to reset the level.
[21:55.62]what hold on what happened while the notepad what did I do I failed it well I typed in manure while the notepad can create many things of vulgarity copyrighted material and proper nouns are not allowed so you tell me I can't write like captain America in there and he shows up on screen
[22:19.83]Well, that's too bad.
[22:20.89]I can't write in the mask from Goosebumps.
[22:24.79]Oh, no.
[22:26.23]You don't have every single word.
[22:27.67]What about this?
[22:28.29]Okay, I'm going to go for this.
[22:31.63]Create object.
[22:32.33]Make the sprout grow.
[22:34.18]Write an object.
[22:36.24]Watering can.
[22:39.92]Done.
[22:41.40]Okay.
[22:42.48]Now.

[22:55.29]What do you need?
[22:56.62]My kitty is stuck on the top of the tree.
[22:58.16]Get it from me.
[22:58.64]Okay.
[22:58.90]Put this in my backpack.

[95:34.34]If I type the word boat and put it in the water, isn't that boring Barry?
[95:38.99]You guys gotta pick a side.
[95:46.21]Huge boat.
[95:54.57]Air propelled.

[96:53.78]Capital City Firehouse.
[97:00.25]He left trash everywhere.
[97:01.51]Well, that's just the nature of this game.
[97:08.63]I need to look the part to become a firehouse dog.
[97:11.03]Okay.
[97:12.83]How about

[97:58.45]Wait, what?
[98:04.11]Here, take this.
[98:07.20]Can't put that on.
[98:11.58]Fireman's hat.
[98:12.34]Alright, how about a hat?
[98:17.79]Here.
[98:19.33]Yes!
[98:20.49]There he goes!
[98:23.85]Oh!
[98:27.11]Turn a station wagon into a fire engine.
[98:33.97]That was so cute.
[98:36.65]Okay, all the fire engines are busy.
[98:38.17]This car needs to become a fire truck.
[98:39.79]Start by painting the car.
[98:47.03]Alright.
[98:47.39]We're going to paint what?
[98:48.68]Red?
[98:49.48]Red?
[98:58.00]Blood.
[99:01.46]Blood.
[99:03.88]How about ketchup?
[99:06.48]Is that- That's- I mean, that's technically red.
[99:23.10]Keyed- Keyed car.
[99:35.70]Blood.
[99:36.32]You can't do blood.
[99:40.82]Use the ketchup on the car.
[99:43.12]Can I do that?
[99:52.53]Oh, shit.
[99:53.22]It didn't work.
[100:04.32]I mean, that's easy.
[100:05.44]It's just red.
[100:06.20]Car needs to be heard.
[100:09.54]Give the DJ something loud to hook up to the car.
[100:14.51]Um... Sure.
[100:23.93]Fire alarm.
[100:24.55]That's a school bell.
[100:29.90]Fireman's almost ready to head out.
[100:31.12]Give him a tool that will help get the job done.
[100:41.42]It's an axe or it's a fire extinguisher.
[100:45.84]It's a boring streak.
[100:48.02]Yeah, but like, you have to do it.
[100:50.28]I can't paint the car with blood.
[100:52.30]Okay.
[101:04.36]Give me a firefighting tool.
[101:12.30]It's a bottle of water?
[101:17.22]That'll do it.
[101:17.80]How about a hose?
[101:25.89]Oh, I attached it to his eye.
[101:28.70]Oh shit.
[101:29.28]Here, now take another one.
[101:30.62]I just like blocked both of his eyes.
[101:45.98]Bye.
[101:49.90]Oh, no, there's a traffic jam.
[101:51.14]Help get over this traffic.
[102:05.03]Crusted.
[102:06.63]I just turned it into, like, toast.
[102:09.73]Hold on.
[102:10.13]Wait, wait, wait.
[102:15.20]Let me think about this creatively.
[102:18.24]I could just put a fan here.
[102:19.67]Put the balloons on there.
[102:21.67]I could... Okay, yeah.
[102:24.07]We're gonna do the balloon strategy.
[102:27.84]Do a catapult.
[102:28.70]Hold on.
[102:29.04]How about a...
[102:48.42]Don't hit me!
[102:51.92]Holy shit, did I get the... I did it, alright, alright, alright, right, right.
[103:00.65]Angry gorilla, works.
[103:05.03]Cool, alright, who's next?
[103:10.27]Help me test all the alarms.
[103:13.35]Test the alarms.
[103:16.61]Okay.
[103:17.67]Empty.
[103:17.83]Give me that.
[103:23.76]Here.
[103:26.68]Test the alarms.
[103:27.72]Okay.
[103:28.56]Sure.
[103:28.80]There's an alarm right there.
[103:29.94]Let's burn that.
[103:33.49]Fire.
[103:33.81]Okay.
[103:35.75]How about this?
[103:36.27]Burning.
[103:43.55]Let's test the fire alarm.
[103:49.75]Oh, wait.
[103:53.16]I can't get up there?
[103:54.00]Why not?
[103:54.46]Play sound.
[103:57.50]Hey, turn.
[103:58.36]Give me that.
[104:07.10]I want to climb this.
[104:16.35]That's cheating.
[104:20.97]Fire alarm on this floor is functional.
[104:22.93]Oh, is it?
[104:26.91]The wing's too big to go up there?
[104:28.17]I just took off all my clothes.
[104:34.78]Give me these back.
[104:40.46]Why can't I just climb this?
[104:44.56]Oh.
[104:46.71]Alright, uh, test that.
[104:51.22]What do you guys need?
[104:52.82]You snore so loudly I can't sleep.
[104:57.45]Okay.
[104:59.53]Uh... Did that work?
[105:18.96]It didn't work.
[105:24.34]Hey, will you put that?
[105:25.06]No, take it off, take it off, take it off!
[105:26.09]I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[105:34.47]Muzzle didn't work.
[105:35.73]Okay, how about, um... A... I'm not gonna do pillow.
[105:45.64]Make him... Death.
[105:48.27]No!
[105:54.09]Earplugs.
[105:54.89]Yeah, but that's so... Alright.
[105:56.43]Earplugs works.
[105:59.33]Sew... Sew his mouth shut.
[106:03.83]I think you underestimate the things you can do in Scribblenauts.
[106:18.70]What?
[106:30.18]Did he just start... Oh, he fell asleep!
[106:37.42]No, he didn't.
[106:37.90]What's going on?
[106:44.27]Why is he thinking of sheep so much?
[106:46.69]He fell asleep because I gave him the pillow, so he didn't even care.
[106:49.17]Oh, okay.
[106:50.21]What do you need?
[106:52.31]I can't find my helmet anywhere.
[106:58.07]Here, I got it.
[107:09.73]Did I just put a diaper in your makeup cabinet?
[107:14.77]That's a surprise for later.
[107:16.09]Uh...
[107:32.03]Wait, is her lock the one that burnt?
[107:42.81]Oh, sorry.
[107:44.57]Ma'am, I'm gonna need that back.
[108:02.65]Ooh, this is a big one.
[108:04.41]Help the survivors defend against the zombie invasion.
[108:09.53]Okay.
[108:10.55]Did they put on new clothes?
[108:26.30]The city has been overrun by zombies.
[108:28.06]Each of the survivors needs some help.
[108:29.82]Start by helping the doctor treat the fireman's wounds.
[108:32.38]I got it.
[108:35.28]Medicine.
[108:36.98]What's wrong with him?
[108:38.56]He's sick.
[108:48.97]What's wrong with him, though?
[108:51.33]Pills.
[108:55.44]Pills.
[108:57.10]Pill.
[108:57.44]Here, take this pill.
[108:58.68]Why do you have to get on top of it?
[109:04.04]What the fuck was that?
[109:08.76]This is the gamer's dream.
[109:10.24]Give her something to help fend off the horde.
[109:13.98]Oh, it's a gamer's dream.
[109:14.96]Alright.
[109:15.26]Where do I get down?
[109:18.94]Alright, here.
[109:38.20]What do you need?
[109:47.48]I know, I get it.
[109:48.60]Alright, it's a gamer's dream.
[109:50.53]It's not a gamer's dream.
[109:51.59]Nobody wants to actually be in a zombie apocalypse.
[109:53.45]That would suck.
[109:54.59]You would die in 10 minutes.
[109:58.08]Oh man, I got a plan.
[109:59.08]I would go to the grocery store and I would bring like an axe and I'd be fucking killing zombies.
[110:03.64]No, you'd get bit.
[110:04.36]You would take a swing at a zombie and you'd hit it in like the fucking shin.
[110:07.64]And the thing would grab you and two more would grab you and you'd get bit in the neck and you're dead instantly.
[110:17.73]Like here, how about a katana?
[110:22.05]Yeah, of course, a katana.
[110:37.48]What do you need?
[110:37.86]Yeah, you know why it's a dull katana?
[110:43.57]Cause- Cause you bought it from- You bought it from like fucking QVC.
[110:48.45]It's- It's not- It's a display.
[110:57.09]I'm so scared, make me feel better.
[111:05.38]You're now happy.
[111:06.71]Happy orphan.
[111:09.37]Apparently.
[111:10.23]No, no, no.
[111:10.61]Scared doesn't mean... You could be scared and happy, right?
[111:16.32]Not scared.
[111:22.48]Zombie.
[111:23.68]Zombie orphan.
[111:40.34]Well, if you were a zombie, you wouldn't be scared of them anymore.
[111:43.44]Because you would just be one.
[111:48.16]Alright, let's go.
[111:59.39]You locked in here?
[112:00.49]Okay.
[112:01.33]Alright, let's go.
[112:02.77]Pills.
[112:05.99]Take it?
[112:06.62]Go ahead.
[112:09.05]Next.
[112:11.07]Gamer.
[112:12.26]What are the fantasies that gamers have in zombie apocalypses?
[112:18.22]Sawed-off shotgun.
[112:32.20]Yeah!
[112:36.21]Calm her down.
[112:36.87]Okay.
[112:37.99]Uh, teddy bear.
[112:39.74]Teddy bear.
[112:42.96]A teddy.
[112:45.74]That worked.
[112:49.12]For drugs.
[112:49.80]No.
[112:50.42]The soldier is convinced that a few simple objects can be combined to make a fighting machine.
[112:54.68]Place three objects inside the box to make a mech.
[113:01.52]Okay.
[113:02.56]Okay.
[113:12.76]Microwave.
[113:15.64]And... Toaster.
[113:24.73]And... Coffee maker.
[113:33.43]With your powers combined... You will make... A kitchen appliance monster.
[113:44.05]What are you doing?
[113:47.80]That's not a mech.
[113:50.50]You... What?
[113:53.54]You said three objects.
[114:00.17]You doing it?
[114:00.57]I could use anything made of metal or something sticky.
[114:05.19]Oh.
[114:05.85]Well, and a glue.
[114:06.67]Any time I had to put the glue in there, too.
[114:12.96]Um...
[114:21.51]Can't put, like, just cheese sauce in there?
[114:33.50]Why does the cheese sauce have health?
[114:37.64]Alright, microwave, toaster, and slime.
[114:48.73]Ooh.
[114:53.31]You added something sticky that can be used to join the parts together.
[114:57.01]Alright.
[115:00.31]Let's go.
[115:00.67]I need a weapon.
[115:13.22]Um, a...
[115:26.15]Code.
[115:27.63]Laser.
[115:28.92]Um... O-nail.
[115:32.92]Flamethrower.
[115:34.42]A drill.
[115:35.46]A dentist drill.
[115:37.26]A nail clipper.
[115:38.73]A spear.
[115:40.07]Yeah.
[115:44.23]Here it comes!
[115:57.65]This is the final ingredient.
[116:04.94]Read the prompt.
[116:08.84]There's three objects inside the box to make a mech.
[116:12.99]It's on the soldier.
[116:23.96]Most electronic devices need a similar power so- oh come on.
[116:28.86]Here, we can outlet.
[116:31.78]There you go.
[116:33.88]Come on, I can't just put an outlet in there.
[116:36.72]Why?
[116:37.10]How about a gasoline?
[116:44.55]There it is.
[116:49.33]It's not what I put in there.
[116:53.60]Distract these zombies while the other survivors escape.
[116:55.84]Hop in the mech when you're ready to begin.
[117:00.91]Distract the zombies while the others escape.
[117:04.12]Okay.
[117:07.32]Get in the robot.
[117:08.18]Hold on.
[117:08.54]Not yet.
[117:23.01]I want like a bunch of warrior clowns.
[117:28.37]Tasty, tasty clowns.
[117:41.08]No, no, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out of that.
[117:43.14]Get out of that.
[117:43.70]That's for me, not for you.
[117:44.62]Alright.
[117:49.12]This is another tasty clown.
[117:51.94]Okay.
[117:59.45]This one's gonna be a delicious clown.
[118:07.28]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[118:08.72]Don't think so.
[118:09.27]Where are you going?
[118:10.87]Oh, my God.
[118:11.29]They're running away because of the zombies.
[118:12.37]What the fuck?
[118:28.84]Oh, you're getting over there.
[118:30.40]Fire!
[118:44.35]Just, he's bait.
[118:46.51]He's a zombie now, that's so funny.
[119:03.54]Now what?
[119:04.42]Fire missiles at the zombies while everyone escapes.
[119:08.22]That's what I'm doing.
[119:15.29]Alright, got it.
[119:36.17]Wait, make an explosive clown?
[119:47.20]Alright, we're good.
[119:49.06]Is he gonna go inside?
[119:50.32]Explosive clown fetish?
[120:00.69]What the hell are you talking about?
[120:11.51]Succulent clown.
[120:16.28]Watch out, you're gonna be taken away.
[120:24.60]Oh man, we have more area.
[120:26.46]How about castle?
[120:27.58]How about go piss?
[120:28.44]That sounds like a good idea.
[120:29.28]I'll be right back. ...
[120:40.15]Thank you.
[121:19.87]you
[122:13.97]you
[123:22.92]Okay, time.
[123:32.45]Time.
[123:33.03]How long have I been gone for?
[123:35.31]How long have I been gone for?
[123:40.79]Give me an exact how long I've been actually gone for.
[123:46.54]Two minutes and what?
[123:48.44]Two minutes and 11 seconds.
[123:49.40]Okay.
[123:52.42]I was peeing the almost entire time I was gone.
[123:58.17]Took me about five or six seconds to leave the room and about five or six seconds to come back into the room.
[124:05.87]That was the longest pee I've ever done in my entire life.
[124:10.32]That was insane.
[124:11.78]I don't understand.
[124:13.06]That makes no sense.
[124:16.59]How is that possible?
[124:17.55]Did you wash your hands?
[124:20.33]Yes, I did.
[124:20.85]You didn't wash your hands.
[124:23.95]Of course I did.
[124:24.76]I did.
[124:26.80]I did.
[124:29.04]Yes, I did.
[124:29.64]I washed my hands every time.
[124:36.95]I don't- that was the- that was- it was actually fucked up.
[124:39.43]Like, I'm actually concerned about that.
[124:40.63]I just peed for like fucking a full two minutes.
[124:43.59]Let's go to the forest.
[124:47.21]Welcome to Meta Forest.
[124:51.21]Ooh, there's another Scribblenauts guy.
[125:01.46]Hungry Mosquito.
[125:06.73]Loaded hungry mosquito.
[125:10.39]Alright, what do you want?
[125:13.54]Help the scout earn his merit badge.

[186:20.06]What just happened?
[186:27.60]What?
[186:32.69]Doesn't have any wheels.
[186:42.73]Help the street performer develop his career as a rock star.
[186:51.07]Should have done electric chair.
[186:55.11]Oh, fucking God.
[186:57.07]No one even said that in chat.
[186:58.17]I just pretended that they did.
[187:01.23]He wants to be a rock star.
[187:02.28]First needs a better instrument to help him rock.
[187:03.92]Okay.
[187:06.56]Yeah, that sucks, dude.
[187:24.13]I was kind of hoping that... Wait!
[187:26.60]Hold on a minute.
[187:29.34]Like a musically talented animal.
[187:31.36]How about, um... A talented... A talented chimpanzee?
[187:46.59]And we're gonna give him a guitar.
[187:56.91]This instrument is awesome, but my band would sound a lot better with additional members.
[188:04.67]Alright, well, hold on.
[188:05.19]So, I need more members.
[188:06.89]Talented chimpanzee.
[188:14.59]How about a musical gorilla?
[188:17.68]Okay.
[188:21.16]Is he a lead singer?
[188:23.72]Now it's what I call a band.
[188:24.62]What we need now is equipment to put on a real show.
[188:29.36]What happened to my character?
[188:30.48]Why does he look like this?
[188:34.05]Lights.
[188:44.35]Is he going to hold it up like a lighter?
[188:45.45]He's going to hold it up like a... People do their phones now, right?
[188:48.65]Stage.
[189:04.16]Alright, here we go!
[189:04.82]Let's start the party!
[189:05.72]You know how horrifying this would be?
[189:21.04]If the street performer on the subway had a gorilla and a chimpanzee just walking around.
[189:28.89]That'd be... Oh my god, that'd be horrifying.
[189:34.62]I don't care how well-trained a gorilla is.
[189:36.54]I don't care how friendly, in quotes, a gorilla is.
[189:39.49]It takes a tenth of a second for them to not like the logo on your shirt or something.
[189:45.63]And boom!
[189:46.49]Your head is smashed into a thousand pieces.
[189:52.20]Nope.
[189:53.00]I don't care how well-trained they are.
[189:54.42]That's scary.
[190:05.39]That was a Joe Rogan- That was a Joe Rogan bit?
[190:10.37]Pull that shit up, Jamie.
[190:12.55]Wait, did he say that before?
[190:24.12]He's getting closer and closer to dying.
[190:25.64]Alright, what about back here?
[190:32.59]Sewer?
[190:35.23]Run off.
[190:35.59]Yeah, let's go to the sewer.
[190:43.46]Well.
[190:47.51]Okay, what do we got?
[190:49.89]The other fish keep making fun of me.
[190:51.45]Help me scare them away.
[191:12.79]A gun photo.
[191:18.75]No, picture of a... Picture or gun.
[191:21.69]Oh.
[191:22.27]How about just gun picture?
[191:35.18]Oh, picture.
[191:36.06]Here.
[191:39.28]I'll give it to him.
[191:57.24]You can't do gun, guys.
[192:00.67]Gun and knife don't work.
[192:01.79]You need to make him, like, big.
[192:04.11]Inflated.
[192:04.61]Like, huge.
[192:10.19]Wait, he's gonna fly up.
[192:11.49]Okay, he's dead.
[192:16.48]I'm ready for a new school to move in.
[192:19.70]Ooh, create.
[192:20.36]Copy.
[192:22.36]Copy.
[192:25.64]Go on in!
[192:27.24]Yeah!
[192:27.78]What's wrong with you?
[192:34.45]Blowing large goldfish.
[192:50.63]I've always lived down here and don't know what I look like.
[192:54.09]Attack!
[192:56.91]I'm not dead!
[192:58.98]We need to give him a mirror.
[193:17.25]What did...
[193:23.29]Wait, did I just, like, tell him that beauty is on the inside in a weird metaphorical way?
[193:34.55]Oh.
[193:36.51]Alright.
[193:38.31]He's scared.
[193:39.31]Oh, well.
[193:40.75]Wait, let's go.
[193:45.84]You're too slow.
[193:50.48]I'm sorry, but it's fine.
[193:52.10]You can be slow if you want.
[193:55.19]Make him fast.
[194:04.94]That's not very fast.
[194:13.91]Speedy.
[194:31.10]I can't even fit down the hallway.
[194:36.93]Alright, let's go.
[194:47.07]You and I are friends.
[194:47.79]What is this even here?
[194:55.48]Oh, there's a guy down here.
[195:02.52]Be a bro and help me break free.
[195:10.99]Be a bro.
[195:11.77]There.
[195:16.27]Oh, he was a criminal!
[195:17.19]He was a criminal!
[195:17.85]Oh, he was a criminal.
[195:20.19]I was supposed to, like, kill him.
[195:23.97]Is that what it wanted me to do?
[195:32.86]Why was... Did I not get the star for that?
[195:34.86]It was... Hell, we break free, and it was like, you broke the criminal free.
[195:37.58]Did the game want me to, like... Why is there a cage down here?
[195:45.29]Was he, like, a murderer or something?
[195:46.53]I don't get it.
[195:46.93]That was my brother.
[195:55.82]What am I talking about?
[195:58.46]He was my brother.
[195:59.18]I don't know.
[195:59.54]There's a cage down here and he's throwing it.
[196:01.54]It's like, oh, you'll let the criminal free.
[196:03.36]I don't know.
[196:04.20]He might have killed 10 people.
[196:05.46]I don't know.
[196:08.28]Oh, that was fun.
[196:08.77]Let's go.
[196:09.13]Can I take him with me?
[196:17.89]Wait.
[196:20.99]Fill the cage with something.
[196:22.71]I'm not putting him in the cage.
[196:24.15]I know a ton of you guys are going to be like, oh, hey, put him.
[196:26.25]No way.
[196:27.28]Not in a million years.
[196:35.44]Save the lobsters.
[196:36.37]Fool the fishermen by filling their trap with something else to eat.
[196:52.78]Some are just sponges.
[197:22.03]Is it because it was electric?
[197:29.00]Yeah, put the... Put the electric... Fucking huge, like 10,000 watt device down here with me.
[197:38.33]But, wait, didn't we talk about this already when that not happened?
[197:43.78]I told you guys, listen, for those that weren't here like a year ago, me and chat got into a big fight.
[197:50.02]Because I said, hey, like if you drop a fucking toaster plugged in into the ocean, like will it shock the, what happens?
[197:59.94]Everyone's like, you're crazy, no, no, no.
[198:02.18]Would it shock the whole thing?
[198:08.04]It was Hitman, yeah.
[198:11.89]Okay, let's do something bigger than that.
[198:15.14]The whole ocean.
[198:15.96]No.
[198:16.76]Okay, what if you were... Hold on.
[198:18.00]But what if you were standing like a hundred feet away of where it was dropped in?
[198:26.55]No, you asked... Wait, I am totally... I'm totally just like gaslighting you guys on this.
[198:32.63]I asked if I dropped my iPhone in the bathtub if I was in it, if it would kill me.
[198:41.80]Oh, right, right, right, right.
[198:42.74]Okay.
[198:45.64]Lightning hits the ocean all the time.
[198:46.82]Alright, but what if you were in... Don't they tell you to get out of the water during a storm?
[198:51.72]I thought that was a big deal.
[198:53.73]They do say that.
[198:56.21]Yeah, they do.
[199:09.76]What's taller than the ocean?
[199:12.88]That's in case lighting hits you.
[199:16.62]He's alive!
[199:17.08]Alright, put something edible in here.
[199:36.32]Can't move this?
[199:43.52]Did I say light?
[199:52.99]Holdable?
[199:56.33]Put an edible diaper in there.
[200:00.19]Pick up.
[200:00.59]There we go.
[200:01.61]Okay.
[200:07.81]So this is... It's in there.
[200:17.99]Oh shit, he did.
[200:19.21]Wait, he's already, like, toxic.
[200:26.36]Alright, what do you want me to do?
[200:33.11]No, don't, it's a do not put, something else.
[200:35.75]I just did the thing that they were trying to do.
[200:51.77]They're going to pull that up and they're going to be like... Remove the waste.
[201:05.64]There must be a better way to dispose of this.
[201:26.28]Oh, no.
[201:29.14]Edible vegan.
[201:31.27]Edible vegan rich.
[201:32.77]Edible vegan... Uh-oh.
[201:45.71]Wait, okay, hold on.
[201:55.03]Hungry vegan.
[202:02.35]Vegan, edible, toxic waste.
[202:03.89]Did I spell hungry wrong?
[202:17.40]Wait, it's not hungry?
[202:18.68]Yes, it is.
[202:24.86]Tasty.
[202:30.34]Tasty, edgitarian.
[202:31.58]What did I just do?
[202:36.48]A tasty vegetarian.
[202:40.64]Okay.
[202:55.49]Edible broccoli toxic waste.
[203:07.47]But, um... Hazmat cleaning guy.
[203:16.70]Just blow it up.
[203:20.40]Vegan edible toxic waste, and we have a glowing large vegetarian starving goldfish.
[203:31.13]Vegan edible toxic waste.
[203:34.89]Eh.
[203:36.99]Make it non-toxic.
[203:39.49]Okay.
[203:40.23]Edible.
[203:41.94]Non-toxic.
[203:46.44]What?
[203:52.26]Really?
[203:52.54]So I'll just make the toxic material non-toxic.
[203:56.91]That's it.
[204:00.07]Oh.
[204:05.27]Well, I guess it was that easy.
[204:11.32]Alright, now we got... I want to go to one of the later areas over here.
[204:14.06]Let's go to the fountain.
[204:16.62]Anafora Falls.
[204:19.43]Cat's drunk?
[204:20.07]What are they doing?
[204:33.49]Bring Shoggoth.
[204:35.31]Bring Shoggoth.
[204:36.11]Bring... Can I?
[204:36.65]Can I bring?
[204:39.59]I don't think I can.
[204:42.45]I can't feel the sunlight by the river.
[204:43.81]Create something to help me tan.
[205:03.03]This is his like human skin.
[205:07.43]And his jerky body.
[205:09.83]Oh, come here.
[205:10.41]Give me this.
[205:11.85]I want to take this.
[205:33.96]Whoa, frog!
[205:35.44]Place something in between these logs to help me cross the river.
[205:55.88]Doesn't help.
[206:01.18]How about some logs?
[206:02.34]How about a bridge?
[206:08.13]So, but that's so easy to do, right?
[206:10.57]It's, oh, I made a bridge.
[206:13.35]Wow.
[206:21.04]Turn a businessman into a fisherman.
[206:22.94]Eh, not yet.
[206:25.22]Hey.
[206:27.38]Look what I got, man.
[206:43.98]Natural.

[207:11.71]This person's dead?
[207:12.59]Oh, okay.
[207:19.82]Who resurrects people?
[207:32.52]Hey, what the fuck are you doing?
[207:35.24]No, not all of us.
[207:38.20]He did it to the frog.
[207:42.82]Oh shit, he's actually a Diablo II necromancer.
[207:47.59]Alright, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna... Give me a steak.
[207:59.35]Stab him through the fucking heart.
[208:07.97]Alright, now I release you.
[208:09.07]Whoa!
[208:14.96]I... Whatever.
[208:20.70]Leave me alone.
[208:21.36]Give it to me.
[208:47.58]Cleanse the undead.
[208:50.46]Okay, cleanse.
[208:53.05]No, now I need a priest.
[209:00.37]What the fuck is a priest gonna do?
[209:01.63]No, I need like a paladin.
[209:02.87]Alright, paladin.
[209:06.07]There we go.
[209:06.71]Alright, save me.
[209:10.27]Holy shit.
[209:11.89]Sorry, that's my bad.
[209:12.61]That's my bad.
[209:13.57]That's my bad.
[209:14.01]I spawned a level 1 paladin.
[209:16.79]That- That's what would happen.
[209:18.35]Okay.
[209:20.57]What a shitty character.
[209:21.63]How about Sorcerer?
[209:26.70]Go get it!
[209:27.22]How do I- How are you supposed to- Zamboni?
[209:37.40]What is that?
[209:40.46]They dead?
[209:41.14]Oh, they are dead.
[209:44.42]I'll take the scepter though.
[209:45.74]What?
[209:47.06]What?
[209:55.56]Teaching a businessman how to fish.
[210:05.09]This man dreams of being a fisherman.
[210:06.45]Start by dressing him appropriately.
[210:15.94]Fisherman hat.
[210:19.18]Fibered hat.
[210:20.92]A firm, a fishable hat.
[210:27.95]Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking of.
[210:29.54]Next, he needs to catch some fish.
[210:31.58]Give him an object to reel them in.
[210:44.18]Bass is not biting.
[210:45.28]Place something in the water that it wants.
[210:47.28]It's like cheese, right?
[210:54.78]Nice.
[211:15.54]Oh, it's an even bigger one!
[211:16.42]Time to catch the rainbow halibut.
[211:19.70]It has more colorful taste.
[211:22.62]Ooh, I like eating colorful food.
[211:33.83]Sherbert.
[211:39.76]Good catch.
[211:47.52]Now to catch a fudge megalodon, give the megalodon its dinner.
[211:50.63]No, it's gonna kill it.
[212:09.28]What's a megalodon's favorite dinner?
[212:10.72]It's like, it's like people.
[212:14.45]Or other huge, or how about like blue whale?
[212:17.09]How big are those?
[212:17.89]That's huge, right?
[212:32.15]What's for dinner?
[212:34.03]It's a fudge megalodon.
[212:37.62]Uh, no.
[212:42.20]There.
[212:43.68]Ah.
[212:51.24]Hooray, you did it.
[212:55.50]It's a big dolphin.
[212:57.33]It's definitely rideable too.
[213:27.25]He just, like, went up and, like, nibbled on his grenade, actually.
[213:30.41]Wait, you just turned it into a skeleton?
[213:37.74]What'd you just do?
[213:38.18]You turned something into a skeleton to kill it.
[213:39.82]What was that?
[213:41.56]Help me sail again.
[213:42.54]Oh, okay.
[213:46.14]Uh, here.
[213:47.18]Wha- I- I- What the fuck are you doing?
[213:57.73]She's going after the priest!
[213:59.37]The priest bailed the fuck out of here!
[214:01.65]And got out and was safe!
[214:05.29]She's going after the priest!
[214:09.77]He peeked his head up behind the rock.
[214:11.12]He was like, are they gone yet?
[214:12.92]Oh shit!
[214:17.18]Help me sail again.
[214:31.38]What did I just get?
[214:44.63]I leveled up something.
[214:45.97]Oh, you stole the scepter!
[214:47.89]Wait, did she just take that from you?
[214:49.45]What happened here?
[214:50.03]Okay, help me sail again.
[215:05.47]What am I doing?
[215:07.43]The priest became a holy warrior.
[215:09.17]Oh, okay.
[215:10.60]Alright, let's fix this boat.
[215:14.16]Uh, fix the engine.
[215:17.54]Oh, fuck this.
[215:23.77]Let's use this one.
[215:47.05]Glue broken on boat.
[215:50.63]Glue?
[215:54.09]Okay, well, should I... I gotta get it out of the water.
[216:18.74]Nevermind.
[216:22.28]Look at these all the way alive.
[216:24.74]Balloons?
[216:25.88]Why would a balloon take like a 10,000 pound, 20,000 pound boat out of the water?
[216:38.50]Strong balloon.
[216:48.75]Yeah, okay, I gotta get rid of this thing.
[216:50.53]I hate this thing.
[216:51.69]Alright, come on, pull it up!
[217:05.78]There it is!
[217:07.42]Alright, so what's wrong with it?
[217:08.90]It's got a problem.
[217:14.54]What do we need to do?
[217:15.31]Fix, uh... blue.
[217:19.70]Alright, stick that on there.
[217:20.88]Technically, it... I did it.
[217:34.27]This bird over here is like, holy shit.
[217:36.42]Did you see what was just in the sky?
[217:41.55]Okay, I know it said attack and shot a crossbow at it.
[217:44.91]It was flex seal.
[217:46.13]Yeah, that's pretty, yeah.
[217:49.51]It was flex seal.
[217:51.75]How do I get up there?
[217:55.24]I'm here with flex seal.
[218:02.30]I can even put it over my mouth to make me stop talking.
[218:16.48]Don't kill that bird, let the bird up!
[218:18.64]Why was there a bird in there?
[218:21.46]Why was there a bird inside of the chest?
[218:23.53]I don't even know who that was.
[218:29.57]I'm gonna say this and I don't know if it's real or not, but I'm gonna just think it is.
[218:41.63]You know how there are people who make slime videos?
[218:48.21]I feel like Flex Seal is some of that kind of stuff, like Flex Putty and Flex Seal.
[218:52.55]Do people make videos of them just like scooping it up and smearing it all over a piece of wood or something?
[219:02.07]I would assume, right?
[219:10.64]Holy shit, I love this guy.
[219:14.90]Help me practice my painting.
[219:19.64]Paintbrush.
[219:24.98]Do it.
[219:27.10]Wow, it's beautiful.
[219:32.76]I love it.
[219:33.28]What's going on over here?
[219:41.17]Help me take a picture with this local.
[219:43.81]I want to dance, but I don't have a beat to follow.
[219:46.11]I can solve that very quickly.
[220:03.90]Does that count?
[220:04.40]I'm gonna take a picture.
[220:08.40]You don't have a camera?
[220:09.96]Here, camera.
[220:10.74]Take it.
[220:20.03]Oh, I have the photo.
[220:20.81]Did it work?
[220:29.94]I think it worked.
[220:33.84]Wait, the- the gorilla has something he wants.
[220:36.94]We only allow gorillas in our troop, and you are no gorilla.
[220:42.14]Yet.
[220:53.25]Get these wings off.
[221:26.41]I can't go in the gorilla suit?
[221:33.43]Put it on... Oh shit, I didn't want to do that.
[221:40.59]Take your clothes off.
[221:41.73]I don't have any clothes on.
[221:48.27]We only allow gorillas.
[221:49.07]You are no gorilla.
[221:58.71]Move out of the way!
[222:02.51]Get out of the way!
[222:07.84]Just... blind them?
[222:17.54]No, that didn't work.
[222:21.50]Uh, where is this present?
[222:25.89]No, they're not going to walk up the edge.
[222:27.79]They don't have that kind of pathing.
[222:31.93]I need a gorilla costume.
[222:42.78]Get in.
[222:47.62]No, it didn't... Okay, a monkey suit.
[223:01.77]Why can't I wear it?
[223:02.35]Edit- you have to edit your avatar?
[223:08.09]No.
[223:10.89]Edit your adjectives.
[223:14.28]Suspect small, uh, gor- gorilla-like?
[223:18.30]Gorilla mask?
[223:28.43]No.

[254:44.20]Me or the guy in the game.
[254:46.81]Because I was going to make him a furry iguana.
[254:53.59]I didn't want to just do dog.
[254:54.64]That's too easy.

[258:47.86]That didn't happen in my game.
[258:58.63]They recently banned those ads.
[259:00.63]Did they really?
[259:01.32]On what grounds?
[259:03.36]Why?
[259:16.21]Because of false... Really?
[259:17.41]That actually happened?
[259:27.57]This shit wasn't even in the fucking game.
[259:49.71]Watch out for the spikes.
[259:51.93]Uncreative.
[259:52.87]I already did this one.
[260:07.12]Your character kind of looks like... My character does look like... That's wicked funny, man.
[260:16.60]Give me the gun.
[260:35.49]What the hell are you shooting at?
[260:36.67]Wait!
[260:38.15]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[260:55.99]Open the door!
[261:06.30]What?
[261:07.32]It was destroyed?
[261:08.16]Make it to the time machine to set things right.
[261:12.46]No!
[261:44.61]Fluffy.
[261:46.37]Fuzzy.
[261:47.37]There.
[261:48.05]Now it can't hurt anymore.
[261:50.15]What?
[261:57.05]Oh, I can't.
[261:57.85]Oh, right, right.
[261:58.79]Okay.
[261:58.99]Actually, you can help me here.
[262:07.40]What?
[262:07.54]Like, just like a cart?
[262:23.60]Shrink ray?
[262:33.10]Shrink ray and then suck it up with a vacuum.
[262:35.04]Doesn't work.
[263:06.62]That's not going to start this all over, is it?
[263:11.24]I don't think I should do that.
[263:43.37]It already is a black hole.
[263:44.55]What?
[263:46.36]I... Heal?
[263:48.72]Healing potions.
[264:20.06]A healing suspect.
[264:24.41]Immortal.
[264:25.11]How about that?
[264:25.67]Yeah.
[264:26.43]Unkillable.
[264:32.49]Invincible.
[264:36.21]Oh.
[264:38.51]I don't think immortality works either.
[264:47.59]Nope.
[264:48.21]Sorry.
[264:51.51]This guy's still alive.
[264:52.27]How did I not kill this guy?
[264:56.71]Alright, he seems to be sitting around.
[265:06.54]Key's in the way.
[265:07.18]God damn it.
[265:08.86]It's gonna kill me.
[265:09.38]It's gonna roll over and kill me.
[265:15.26]I need the key though.
[265:27.48]Use?
[265:30.63]Make a new key.
[265:32.87]Okay, how- Shit.
[265:51.11]Come on, really?
[266:12.60]No, it took it over.
[266:14.58]Come on.
[266:15.90]Alright, turn it off and spin it this way.
[266:17.36]Alright, we're good.
[266:28.14]Bye.

[266:37.67]Oh, please.

[268:34.00]The umbrella was fucking me up.
[268:35.78]Oh my god.
[268:36.46]Alright, box!
[268:59.93]Get it!
[269:13.91]I want to be able to match him in firepower.

[270:24.42]Yeah, I've already seen it.
[270:37.05]Spray him with water.
[270:37.87]He's electric.
[270:42.96]There you go.
[270:43.80]Now what are you going to do?
[270:51.36]Well, he's going to be... Whatever.

[271:53.59]Alright, this time we're gonna do this right.
[271:56.64]Uh, wings.
[272:07.56]Here we go.
[272:10.58]Okay.

[272:16.75]A big rod.
[272:23.84]Good.
[272:23.94]Let's go.
[272:24.32]Watch out for the lightning on this roof.
[272:36.66]Good.
[272:38.24]Take it to the time machine.
[272:39.14]Watch out for the strong gusts.
[272:40.58]The spikes are dangerous.
[272:42.79]Or are they?
[272:50.85]Oh, what?
[273:02.37]How did that happen?
[273:13.40]Wait, that's instantly... Holy shit, that sucks.
[273:21.86]What?
[273:30.42]What?
[273:40.86]Why?
[273:41.34]Jeremiah, I'm gonna leave if you keep dying.
[273:55.15]I'm try- Hey, look, I'm trying my absolute hardest.
[274:01.69]I didn't... Those things look like they're gonna move.
[274:04.11]Okay, just take his fucking gun.
[274:15.38]Oh my god, please don't die.
[274:19.94]Please don't die.
[274:20.48]Please don't die.
[274:21.36]What am I doing?
[274:22.45]Click on him.
[274:40.21]Give me that key.
[274:41.19]Are you fucking kidding me?
[274:44.56]Oh!
[275:11.00]Tiny.
[275:27.95]Tiny.
[275:29.38]Tiny.
[275:29.74]There we go.
[275:33.08]Every time.
[275:34.26]Every time.
[275:34.74]It doesn't matter.
[275:35.38]Whatever.
[275:43.11]Okay, so I'm gonna block it with a vent or something.
[276:05.22]I'm gonna cover that up.
[276:09.90]like a tarp on it.
[276:11.06]I don't know, like a pool tarp.
[276:35.90]Thank you.
[277:05.93]Fill it with concrete.
[277:07.99]Can I just run through this?
[277:09.79]Just give me like a missile launcher and I'm just running through.
[277:12.59]That's water in there.
[277:43.48]Okay, let's relax for a second.
[277:45.76]Just a minute.
[277:47.54]Just a second.
[277:54.43]What?
[277:55.79]Can I do this?
[277:56.39]At least I can do this.
[277:58.67]Okay, good.
[278:07.65]Why did...
[278:24.72]Soundproof.
[278:38.71]Write an object.
[278:39.45]No, no, no.
[278:39.79]Go back.
[278:45.16]I can't walk down.
[278:45.88]I think I have to destroy this stuff.
[278:50.08]Otherwise, those don't fall.
[279:07.62]Put on heavy shoes, will that work?
[279:14.08]Take his gun, take his gun, take his gun, take his gun!
[279:32.53]Have you watched the Daedalus Effect stream?
[279:34.13]I streamed the Daedalus Effect stream.
[279:35.93]That was me.
[279:51.72]It was a deep fake.
[279:54.80]I don't want to fuck this up again.
[279:55.90]I got to get out of this stupid prison.
[279:59.71]Again, tiny.
[280:19.66]And what else?
[280:20.46]Shockproof.
[280:44.99]Alright, let's go.
[280:48.13]I need a balloon.
[280:48.81]I need wings.
[280:57.24]I'm going to give wings to you, too.
[280:59.20]Come with me.
[281:00.90]We can do it together.
[281:01.54]And you can be sort of the guy that goes first.
[281:07.23]One wing?
[281:07.69]Alright, come with me.
[281:17.42]Follower?
[281:27.69]Friendly flying, flying friend.
[281:33.25]Let's go.
[281:41.24]Guardian.
[281:44.94]Just rope him?
[282:11.22]He's having fun!
[282:18.99]Oh my god!
[282:19.59]Oh my god!
[282:20.13]Let go!
[282:20.43]Let go!
[282:20.71]Let go!
[282:21.01]Let go!
[282:21.35]Let go!
[282:21.59]This camera's horrible.
[282:22.49]I don't know where... Hold on.
[282:23.45]Let go.
[282:25.37]Stop pulling me that way.
[282:26.45]Stop pulling me that way.
[282:27.53]Let go.
[282:29.62]No, I took off my cool hat.
[282:31.94]No, I took off my cool stuff!
[282:34.32]No, I took off my cool nose!
[282:36.26]No, I took off my cool wings!
[282:38.78]There.
[283:01.26]So, uh... Heavy... Heavy pants.
[283:10.77]Why am I flying?
[283:16.75]Heavy shoes.
[283:26.92]Too small.
[283:27.72]Oh, uh, okay.
[283:46.62]It's not working.
[283:49.67]Get rid of the wing.
[283:54.45]Holy shit.
[283:54.95]Okay, hold on.
[283:56.09]Wait, wait, wait.
[283:56.55]I have an idea.
[283:57.69]What if I put just like a metal platform or something?
[284:00.23]Or like a... What if I just... I'm going to weigh myself down with something.
[284:05.42]I don't know.
[284:05.82]Like a piano.
[284:42.28]I just mini golfed off the piano into the spikes.
[284:58.60]Just make yourself heavy.
[284:59.58]How?
[285:10.83]Metal wings?
[285:15.61]Make yourself really obese.
[285:18.75]Slow and obese?
[285:21.73]Certain size increases.
[285:23.35]See, you can't.
[285:24.04]You're not allowed.
[285:42.20]I know what it is.
[285:42.84]Turn it on.
[285:49.09]What about an anvil?
[285:50.05]I mean, I put a whole house on there and it was blowing it up.
[285:55.45]I think I just have to wait until it's not blowing and then go.
[286:09.60]Use a helmet?
[286:10.16]I don't think that's going to do anything.
[286:25.08]Wait, how did you get that back?
[286:35.57]Make yourself really fast.
[286:36.63]I'm gonna do incredibly fat, incredibly heavy, incredibly fast.
[286:40.36]Cover the spikes so I can't crash into them.
[286:42.94]It all falls.
[286:43.50]It's physics.
[287:05.03]Make an immovable object?
[287:07.26]What's more immovable than a house?
[288:00.24]Is this Jump King?
[288:02.44]It kind of is.
[288:04.06]He's mad at this game.
[288:05.02]No, I'm not.
[288:06.08]Says who?
[288:07.54]I love this.
[288:08.02]Okay.
[288:09.90]I'm going to make an immovable... An immovable... I'm going to make an immovable house.
[288:27.88]It's going past it.
[288:51.72]Holy shit, that scared me.
[289:04.16]Oh, pog.
[289:05.26]Champ.
[289:06.23]Pog.
[289:07.15]Champ.
[289:08.21]Pog.
[289:08.61]I should get that out of the way.
[289:14.33]Time travel.
[289:17.83]Hasn't been destroyed yet.
[289:18.97]Grab it.
[289:25.57]I thought that was going to be way harder.
[289:35.28]Did it.
[289:38.00]I did it.
[289:38.36]Did I go on the roof?
[289:45.04]Streamer, is it going to children's game?
[289:50.62]It's not a children's game.
[289:52.00]It's an E for everyone game.
[290:02.81]That means everyone can enjoy it.
[290:05.53]These watchtowers don't come with a bathroom.
[290:12.68]Put a toilet in there?
[290:13.40]Alright, yeah.
[290:18.84]Did you go in it?
[290:24.00]What about you?
[290:25.44]Help bridge the gap between the princess and me!
[290:40.12]Easy.
[290:41.36]Black, hold them together.
[290:42.63]Easy.
[290:46.95]See?
[290:51.93]Why?
[290:53.63]Why do they always jump off the roof?
[290:56.06]What's wrong with everybody?
[290:58.76]What is wrong with everybody?
[290:59.92]Alright, let's keep going.
[291:03.74]I've been playing this for five hours.
[291:07.41]What the hell?
[291:08.05]Where'd the time go?
[291:10.90]Up in the pond.
[291:18.35]Alligator.
[291:18.75]I love alligators.
[291:30.08]I really gotta go, but it's really gross in there.
[291:49.50]Oh, he means in here.
[291:50.24]Did I just use it?
[291:54.89]Alright, it's really gross in there.
[291:57.79]Let's clean it.
[291:58.59]Uh, mop.
[292:04.92]You alright?
[292:05.26]Oh, there we go.
[292:06.90]Alright, he mopped it.
[292:10.30]You can now play as Maxwell's brother Scratch.
[292:12.68]Don't think I want to.
[292:16.41]Uh-oh.
[292:18.17]Get these woodpeckers away from me.
[292:29.41]Look what's over here.
[292:29.99]A nice, tasty, juicy worm.
[292:46.45]They don't eat worms?
[292:47.61]What do they eat?
[292:58.62]That one held on for so long.
[293:01.18]I need to restart.
[293:02.07]That was horrible.
[293:19.40]Hillbilly.
[293:22.20]Uh, okay.
[293:22.90]You want to abduct the... Give us what we want, and we'll leave you in peace.
[293:26.12]Okay, you definitely want to abduct this guy.
[293:30.12]Let's make it easy.
[293:44.47]Okay, use the bridge.
[293:45.11]Why are you stupid?
[293:50.48]Alright, what is he like?
[293:51.80]How about this?
[293:52.22]How about, um... Hungry Hillbilly.
[294:30.01]Suck him up!
[294:33.54]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[294:52.09]Help Maxwell find aliens.
[294:53.33]Okay.
[295:07.29]Aliens walk among us in disguise.
[295:09.11]The first alien is afraid of bright lights.
[295:10.97]Flashlight.
[295:31.69]Floodlight.
[295:41.48]Uh, fluorescent light.
[295:43.02]Highlight light?
[295:48.64]Twilight fluorescent twilight?
[295:51.17]Okay, I don't think
[296:13.43]Bright light.
[296:13.79]You don't like bright lights.
[296:14.73]What about the sun?
[296:20.97]That's very bright.
[296:25.64]Got him.
[296:28.48]Afraid of loud noises.
[296:39.51]This guy?
[296:42.47]Okay, loud noises.
[296:43.73]Cymbals.
[296:45.89]Let's smash them together.
[296:46.97]There you go.
[296:57.81]Poster.
[296:58.17]Terrified of... What did it say?
[296:59.81]Water?
[297:00.07]Terrified of water.
[297:14.04]You don't want it?
[297:17.08]You're not even a real cat.
[297:19.28]Just... blow you off with a fan.
[297:31.10]Now what?
[297:31.54]Now what?
[297:33.62]Rate of heights.
[297:37.08]It's you.
[297:39.47]I think it's her.
[297:48.38]It's me.
[297:49.00]Bungie?
[298:03.62]No, trampoline, right?
[298:05.82]Could launch him up in the air.
[298:27.26]What did I think was gonna happen?
[298:28.46]Like, really?
[298:29.92]What did I honestly think was gonna happen?
[298:35.81]Alright, let's make this quick.
[298:52.78]I'm trying to get it on her.
[298:55.39]Whatever.
[298:55.71]It's here for you whenever you want it.
[298:57.11]Okay.
[298:58.27]Light.
[299:03.04]Sound.
[299:18.71]Water.
[299:21.71]Nuke.
[299:22.25]I need to complete this.
[299:45.20]What happened?
[299:48.16]What happened?
[299:50.62]Did my shirt... Did my shirt get caught on the edge of the... Did my shirt get caught on the edge of the cabinet and, like, fucking just snap my neck?
[300:01.45]What the fuck?
[300:07.97]The sun with the trampoline?
[300:10.61]The sun's not killing us when it's down here.
[300:17.29]Okay, so you're telling me that the sun being 10 feet away from us is okay, but if I touch the sun, I instantly die.
[300:28.59]Well, get the hell out of here then.
[300:32.22]Oh my god.
[300:33.12]Okay, loud sounds.
[300:34.42]Jesus.
[301:20.64]I can't believe I died from the sun.
[301:25.07]Didn't use nuke, didn't you?
[301:26.27]No, I'm not going to use a nuke.
[301:29.45]Ooh, barbecue?
[301:31.43]Play something to grill on the Barbie.
[301:33.23]Oh, yes.
[301:36.99]I'll take the wings off.
[301:42.34]Okay, what do I need to cook?
[301:43.42]How about a shish kebab?
[301:54.40]Yes!
[302:03.01]I haven't had a bite in weeks.
[302:04.43]Well, look what I got for you.
[302:08.05]It's a shish kebab.
[302:19.98]What are you doing?
[302:21.54]What the fuck are you doing, man?
[302:22.72]Why are you so mad at me?
[302:28.01]You want a shish kebab?
[302:35.54]Raw chicken.
[302:40.48]He's so mad at this frog, he's pissed.
[302:48.39]He eats... He just ate me!
[302:54.56]Don't eat the frog!
[302:57.31]Um, alright.
[302:57.81]I don't know.
[302:58.31]We'll just, like, curse him.
[303:53.28]Glowing toxic alligator.
[303:55.48]I need somebody to kiss.
[303:56.46]A princess?
[304:05.92]Oh.
[304:06.06]I don't know.
[304:08.62]Didn't the princess kiss the frog and it turns into a prince?
[304:23.85]Prince Frog.
[304:35.88]Oh.
[304:38.42]I need to feed this alligator.
[304:44.49]What about just a chicken?
[304:45.77]Just the bird.
[304:46.61]A chicken.
[304:49.55]Not into it.
[305:02.96]What's his problem?
[305:09.27]He's not even aggressive anymore.
[305:10.33]What?
[305:35.90]Oh, maybe it's because I dropped a nuke on him.
[305:37.68]Okay.
[305:40.54]Oh, everything is softlocked because of the nuke.
[305:43.25]Well, these guys are alright.
[305:44.03]These guys didn't get affected.
[305:45.69]I want to be a duckling.
[305:46.65]Okay, how about a duck-like turtle?
[305:56.97]A ducky turtle.
[306:06.47]Oh, fuck it.
[306:06.87]Whatever.
[306:07.13]The place is... I nuked it.
[306:10.99]What about Ruins of Ellipsis?
[306:25.84]Ducky's my favorite.
[306:27.58]Oh, shit.
[306:28.02]I still have radioactivity on me.
[306:37.06]Clean.
[306:38.92]I'll be glowing still, that's fine.
[306:41.06]Clean, lowing.
[306:44.87]Clean.
[306:45.31]Just clean.
[306:49.65]There.
[306:50.75]Okay.
[306:52.81]This carnivorous plant may hold the cure for many diseases, but I can't get it to bloom.
[306:57.80]Blood.
[306:58.80]Right?
[307:01.90]Here it is.
[307:08.73]It's a hungry carnivorous plant.
[307:10.29]We need to put, um, like, fertilize it.
[307:16.88]Pick it up.
[307:17.58]Fertilize it.
[307:22.04]Not what I had in mind.
[307:25.66]Bugs in there.
[307:27.44]Ant.
[307:35.60]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[307:38.18]I got it under control.
[307:38.94]I got it.
[307:52.19]Huge ant hill.
[307:53.57]Our leader has died.
[307:54.45]Create a new leader suitable for us.
[307:57.52]Oh, sure.
[308:18.82]What's he eating?
[308:26.92]Our leader's died!
[308:27.58]Create a new leader!
[308:28.30]Um, the huge, cosmic, obese, kingly ant is not... Queen!
[308:35.06]Oh, you're right.
[308:36.00]That's true.
[308:43.17]Queenly, obese, cosmic, huge, ant leader.
[308:52.29]Laser.
[309:01.42]Outfit your party of brave adventurers for a legendary journey.
[309:04.54]Wait, what about the bird with the hair?
[309:09.60]Uh, no.
[309:10.02]What about you?
[309:11.06]I'm so plain.
[309:11.68]Add an adjective to me so I can fit in.
[309:13.41]Here we have hair.
[309:15.57]Green.
[309:17.89]Parakeet tropical.
[309:20.14]Okay.
[309:21.12]Hmm.
[309:48.62]I didn't do anything.
[309:51.96]You just put barbecue sauce on me.
[309:55.26]Oh, right, right, right.
[309:56.20]Sorry, man.
[309:56.68]Man, sorry about that, man.
[309:57.70]Hold on, man.
[309:58.92]I got you.
[309:59.28]Hold on, sir.
[310:01.35]Sorry about that, my friend.
[310:02.45]I'll take care of that just really quick.
[310:03.85]Hold on.
[310:05.41]I'll just take care of that real quick.
[310:07.35]Let's have a cheesy, man.
[310:09.05]Cheesy, man.
[310:10.35]Hey, cheesy.
[310:13.34]No, no, no, no.
[310:14.10]That one's dumb too.
[310:14.80]I don't want that one.
[310:15.65]That one's stupid too.
[310:18.07]How about Gravity Bird?
[310:28.86]Gravity Bird.
[310:47.89]It's going up there and it's gonna go directly into this bird's nostrils and puke is gonna go over on this side of the screen.
[311:07.80]What a lovely bird!
[311:08.78]Hey!
[311:23.14]Wait, he's like, you made me ugly.
[311:24.76]Just give me something to help me study these chimps.
[311:36.58]There, video camera.
[311:43.26]Crystal huge rib cage.
[311:46.66]Oh wait, he's kicking his, oh no.
[311:54.24]I'm ugly and no one can be pretty.
[311:59.32]Only him though, why?
[312:29.00]Oh, I can't give him the slingshot.
[312:44.69]The ultimate.
[312:46.17]The ultimate.
[312:49.19]Not even real anymore.
[312:50.09]VR?
[313:01.03]Mango tree.
[313:08.10]Still missing some.
[313:08.76]Oh, down here.
[313:13.78]Well, sorry to hear that.
[313:22.14]How about this one?
[313:23.88]Outfit the party.
[313:32.77]Prepare the adventurers for an epic quest.
[313:34.29]Provide the warrior with a weapon.
[313:37.30]All good?
[314:14.23]Eat Ray.
[314:23.44]Uh, a spare cannon.
[314:26.22]Cannon.
[314:36.11]I thought that was gonna rock his head back.
[314:48.58]There.
[314:50.40]A whip!
[314:54.16]What about you?
[314:54.70]A weapon he can use from a distance.
[315:00.99]Maybe a bow and arrow?
[315:03.35]No.
[315:04.31]No way!
[315:07.77]This magician wants to do something magical.
[315:09.78]A weapon that channels magical ability.
[315:20.49]The Cleric's role is to support the team, give her something to heal the party members.
[315:51.98]That's disgusting.
[315:53.20]Fine, here you go.
[316:22.96]Nice.
[316:25.61]Nice shooting.
[316:26.33]Nice microphoning.
[316:36.55]Is there something I could have done there to stop them?
[316:42.11]Oh, no.
[316:42.97]She's going to revive.
[316:48.66]Did I give them these?
[316:59.43]Oh, cool.
[317:01.72]Very cool.
[317:02.18]Very nice.
[317:02.56]Uh-huh.
[317:05.36]You know, I was the manager of the team, so... I think I deserve a couple of these.
[317:20.73]Yeah.
[317:21.15]Four gold coins dropped.
[317:23.29]I'm gonna take four and a half, and you're gonna split the other half evenly between the four of you.
[317:31.82]And then you're gonna get ready, and you're gonna fucking go on another adventure, and we're gonna do it all over again.
[317:40.89]I'm an asshole.
[317:50.80]You get one fourth of one coin.
[317:52.96]I'll be taking that one.
[318:02.71]He's a communist?
[318:04.77]When did I say that?
[318:08.51]I just said, I told you to go in there and then I took four and a half coins.
[318:23.15]Help me find the crystal bones of- I know- I know where they are!
[318:25.89]I know where they are!
[318:44.11]Capitalist, not communist.
[318:45.81]Oh.
[318:53.13]I'm so glad that didn't hit me right in the fucking head.
[318:54.93]Alright, here we go.
[319:15.98]I got you juicy baby back ribs.
[319:26.48]There's more?
[319:27.16]Oh.
[319:32.62]Found one.
[319:34.58]Put this dude back together again.
[319:40.63]Take it.
[319:43.33]Capitalists in chat.
[319:51.49]Guys, I told you about how much money I lost on Beyond Meat.
[319:56.78]Is that something that you would hear from a communist?
[320:06.51]Break this down!
[320:17.60]I saved the bunny.
[320:18.46]Okay, now we need to... He's a fake communist.
[320:23.08]What does that even mean?
[320:29.42]Investing in fake meat.
[320:31.26]No, I told the story already.
[320:32.74]I was like, the thing's valued at like five times Microsoft.
[320:36.28]Like, there's no fucking way.
[320:37.96]Absolutely not a chance in hell that this stays at this insane price.
[320:42.33]No fucking way.
[320:47.37]And it did.
[320:47.95]And it went higher.
[320:48.69]Way higher.
[320:49.11]And I was like, well, this is stupid.
[320:51.87]Wait, these are the bones.
[321:06.83]Oh, up here.
[321:13.51]I have to dismount.
[321:18.35]You scared?
[321:19.31]Oh, you were scared that whole time?
[321:20.85]What is it?
[321:21.83]Are you okay?
[321:22.23]Are you alright?
[321:25.31]Take off the glasses.
[321:26.91]Take off the... Hey, it's okay.
[321:30.36]It's alright.
[321:38.60]I need wings.
[321:43.82]Yeah, this is also, this is like two or three years ago.
[321:59.89]Help him.
[322:02.39]I'll help him, Doran.
[322:09.74]There's more bones.
[322:10.54]Are you kidding me?
[322:15.12]Oh, no, there's not.
[322:15.68]Alright, there we go.
[322:18.52]I did it.
[322:20.16]That's it.
[322:20.66]Oh, there's one more thing that I didn't do.
[322:23.00]Well.
[322:23.20]I remember I went to biz, made a bunch of awful investments, and never looked back.
[322:36.55]Though that didn't happen.
[322:38.91]I did- Look.
[322:42.21]Look.
[322:43.39]We have to understand.
[322:44.23]Oh, and by the way, by the way, all of the haters and all the people that were making fun of the crypto stuff, oh, he's got an Ethereum account!
[323:03.42]He's called BTC!
[323:04.32]It's dead!
[323:07.71]Have you looked at it today?
[323:09.29]Did you look at it yesterday?
[323:13.00]Well, isn't that interesting?
[323:16.56]It's almost back to all time high.
[323:20.87]I was told that it was dead in the water.
[323:29.76]And look at me now.
[323:30.66]I sold it at like a 60% loss because I'm terrified.
[323:36.99]Because after it went down to like $3,000, I was like, alright, well, it's gone.
[323:41.17]I'm going to sell.
[323:47.73]But that doesn't exclude the principle that I knew it was going to be a thing.
[323:51.07]I knew it was going to happen, but I needed some of that cash.
[323:54.36]I needed a cash flow at that moment.
[323:57.30]I didn't want to sell them, but I needed the cash because that was when I was moving here.
[324:00.06]I was moving to Vegas and I was like, you know, I could use, I could use, I could use like a few thousand dollars right now.
[324:05.43]Don't worry.
[324:15.55]Because I made it all back with this last run.
[324:38.18]What are you talking about?
[324:40.65]Oh, this person has no idea.
[324:42.31]Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, BTC.
[324:44.65]Like three years ago, I talked about how I was like really into it and I was getting involved.
[324:47.75]I might not have been around for like three or three years ago.
[324:51.43]Like four years ago almost.
[324:58.22]Let's go to the new zone.
[325:05.68]Alright, let's do one more.
[325:07.74]I want to go to Pirate Cove.
[325:08.80]Bitcoin's not even a currency.
[325:14.61]Well, I can't think of something worse to say to an internet group of technologically sound individuals than what you just said out loud.
[325:23.64]There's a bunch of people here.
[325:26.80]You essentially just told everybody all of your politics, how you believe in everything, and then you just started a war.
[325:31.64]You just started a chat war.
[325:47.01]I need a tool from my trade to finally settle this argument.
[326:10.88]Ew, what's going on down here?
[326:12.32]Something terrible has happened to the crew who helped break the curse.
[326:28.02]Okay.
[326:29.40]Crew has become cursed.
[326:30.36]Give each crew... Otto?
[326:31.66]What are you doing, Otto?
[326:34.82]Hold on.
[326:35.34]Let me go.
[326:36.08]I gotta go pee, too.
[326:36.72]Let me get Otto.
[326:39.24]And go pee.
[326:39.48]I think he wants to come in.
[326:42.58]You wanna come in?
[326:43.96]Alright, one sec.
[328:32.91]Okay.
[329:20.84]Slug's outdated.
[329:21.58]Dupe overrated.
[329:23.78]Long have I waited.
[329:24.50]Otto has invaded.
[329:25.86]Oh.
[329:31.25]Hi, Otto.
[329:33.05]He has invaded, actually.
[329:34.03]He's in the room right now.
[329:37.29]Sleeping on his bed.
[329:38.01]Uh, there we go.
[329:50.59]Show auto for minus a hundred million off the dead, right?
[329:57.89]Uh... I hope the webcam's not even, like, plugged in.
[330:04.13]I plugged in my controller for yesterday.
[330:07.75]It's a deal.
[330:08.39]Oh, shit.
[330:08.91]Hold on.
[330:09.17]Let me think about that.
[330:14.93]Give the warrior of our group a medieval weapon.
[330:18.77]Cadillacs.
[330:24.13]Okay.
[330:25.53]Give.
[330:27.05]First curse has been broken.
[330:28.07]The next crew member loved his facial hair, but now he's almost bald.
[330:31.09]Okay, beard.
[330:34.72]Long beard.
[330:35.50]Okay.
[331:04.31]Uh, I guess regular beard?
[331:06.57]Okay, what?
[331:11.93]TikTok, TikTok, deals running out.
[331:14.39]Alright, 100 million.
[331:16.82]100 million, right?
[331:20.60]100 million off the dead.
[331:21.48]Let's go.
[331:24.73]Oh, my webcam is plugged in.
[331:26.09]He lied about that.
[331:26.93]I didn't.
[331:27.83]Yes, you did.
[331:28.92]I may have.
[331:31.52]Otto?
[331:34.71]Otto?
[331:34.83]Otto?
[332:05.08]Show him now.
[332:05.70]I am.
[332:08.08]My webcam's like... This webcam was last used on Halloween.
[332:17.79]Instead of all the Halloween settings.
[332:30.48]This looks like shit.
[332:31.58]Why does this look so terrible?
[332:42.97]video game whatever I I look like I'm a six sepia tone there is no auto there is auto hold on there is auto
[333:14.38]scam.
[333:14.90]No, I'm just getting him in the right spot.
[333:16.61]I don't want to just rip him up here.
[333:18.33]He's fragile.
[333:19.21]You don't want to just like, oh, here's my dog.
[333:20.80]Okay, come here.
[333:23.96]Let's go.
[333:49.56]I'm... No, I'm not... This is not the dog yet.
[333:51.67]Hold on.
[333:51.87]Okay.
[334:03.34]Don't...
[334:21.00]That's a hundred million, by the way.
[334:23.47]That's a hundred million, by the way.
[334:29.07]He's my special boy.
[334:36.02]Favorite thing in the- favorite person in the world.
[334:38.20]And yes, he is a person.
[334:41.22]He's my little person!
[334:42.26]Okay, you can go.
[334:45.10]Okay.
[334:48.24]Alright, the camera sucks.
[334:50.45]In a really shitty place.
[334:51.15]Let's just pretend I was up here this whole time.
[334:53.37]Yes.
[334:58.47]Get a haircut.
[335:05.04]Delayed?
[335:07.32]Oh, why was it delayed?
[335:08.18]That's weird.
[335:13.18]Shave that hundred million off, please.
[335:20.71]Alright, let's finish this up.
[335:28.63]What's the next task?
[335:29.38]The Wisp needs a mirror.
[335:34.88]Mirror.
[335:35.44]Mirror for the Wisp.
[335:41.38]Desynced footage does not count.
[335:42.97]Yes, it does.
[335:43.75]Teach the brainless crew member.
[335:52.76]Professor.
[335:53.16]You're so scared.
[335:57.01]Something about Polly.
[336:00.19]Reunite me with Polly.
[336:01.95]Parakeet.
[336:05.57]There he is.
[336:16.12]De-synced footage is 50% what it's worth?
[336:18.90]What are you talking about, man?
[336:27.42]That is not true.
[336:29.70]That's unbelievable.
[336:30.88]That was not in the contract.
[336:32.27]That was not in the verbal contract.
[336:33.55]It was just show auto on cam.
[336:35.77]It didn't say it had to be the right sync.
[336:37.79]It didn't say it had to have the right audio settings.
[336:39.93]It was just show auto on cam.
[336:41.26]That's $100 million shaved off the debt.
[336:42.50]Thank you very much.
[336:43.20]I'll take the $100 million shaved off the debt, please.
[336:56.94]Oh, let's do the final areas.
[336:58.40]75?
[337:00.42]No, 100 million.
[337:02.06]That's what we agreed on.
[337:03.34]Here come the final areas.
[337:17.91]Speaking of Otto, I actually need to feed him.
[337:21.39]That's why he came over here in the first place.
[337:25.91]And it's been about six hours.
[337:28.45]I think it's time for me to go.
[337:29.71]I also need to feed myself, too.
[337:37.29]Feed Otto on stream.
[337:42.56]No, no.
[337:43.28]I'm not bringing all this food up here.
[337:45.06]Enable links, tiny man.
[337:47.96]Did you guys abuse it?
[337:54.14]Yeah, that's why he was like barking at the door.
[337:56.39]He's like, excuse me.
[337:57.23]Like, it's time, man.
[337:59.67]Get down here and feed me.
[338:06.03]That's a good place to stop.
[338:08.10]That was a lot of fun.
[338:11.76]Maybe I'll keep this in the bag for random days.
[338:17.22]It's pretty fun.
[338:17.60]It was just fun to chill and do this.
[338:26.01]A billion if I show Otto feeding him on stream?
[338:31.15]No way.
[338:33.24]One billion.
[338:37.52]That's a major amount.
[338:42.16]We're seeing that's a deal.
[338:44.68]Okay, do I have to do it right now?
[338:47.61]Or can I open the next stream with that?
[338:58.38]Instead of my starting soon screen, I will have a camera set up where it auto is eating stream starting soon screen.
[339:06.04]You know what words I was just trying to say.
[339:14.43]It's now or never.
[339:15.51]No, I'm not doing it now.
[339:18.65]Do it now, I'm fucking dying to see it.
[339:21.49]I'll do more auto content, I promise.
[339:31.17]Let's delay him so he can't feed.
[339:32.89]No!
[339:33.35]What, are you crazy?
[339:35.37]There is no delay.
[339:36.35]It's over.
[339:36.75]I'll see you guys on... Let's see.
[339:46.10]Tuesday?
[339:46.72]Tuesday or Wednesday?
[339:47.52]Probably Wednesday.
[339:48.04]Yeah, we'll go Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[339:55.80]We'll go at least Wednesday, Thursday, Friday in this coming week.
[340:08.17]I have some things to do.
[340:10.61]I have some decisions to make.
[340:13.45]I have to talk to my doctor.
[340:15.09]Told you earlier.
[340:16.98]Some of you may have not been around.
[340:19.70]But I have to start setting up some of these procedures.
[340:25.48]I'm going to get trigger point injections into my back.
[340:29.66]I've had injections before in my butt.
[340:34.88]It did a little bit, didn't do a whole lot, but they're actually going to do it into the trigger points this time.
[340:42.05]Those of you that don't know, I've had this lingering, annoying medical problem for the last couple of years.
[340:50.99]My back and chest hurt all the time.
[340:52.71]It never goes away.
[340:53.49]It never gets any worse.
[340:56.53]I get tight sometimes if I sit down or stand for too long.
[341:00.43]But,
[341:02.09]The solution, I've been through the absolute ringer when it comes to exams and procedures and everything.
[341:08.24]I have two discs in my spine that are dark, which is signaling some type of at least mild start of degeneration.
[341:21.68]I also have a hernia in my esophagus.
[341:24.51]Hiatal hernia.
[341:25.91]Not that big, but it may be causing some of the chest problems.
[341:29.37]They think I might just be getting comboed.
[341:34.94]Gonna do trigger point injections.
[341:36.16]My back muscles are always painful, so we're gonna see if that works.
[341:38.58]If that helps, then I might not have to do any much else.
[341:45.55]Yeah, the part where your esophagus connects to your stomach.
[341:49.31]That's where my hernia is.
[341:50.33]It's called a hiatal hernia.
[341:52.84]If your dad had something similar, the injections helped.
[341:58.38]I hope so, because honestly, it's the back that's... I could deal with that upper kind of abdominal, mid, center of my chest pain.
[342:07.43]It's not that big of a deal.
[342:09.67]But, man, the, like, spine and back pain.
[342:15.09]It's sometimes.
[342:16.07]It's debilitating sometimes, I'll be honest.
[342:20.61]Sometimes, like, it'll get so tight that, you know, it kind of drives you crazy, right?
[342:30.58]Especially if I do a lot of activity, and that's why, remember after the green screen stream, I... I did a lot of activity, and then turned into dog shit.
[342:41.98]So the idea is to go get these injections, go get the trigger point injections, and go manage kind of that spinal problem, and that won't happen anymore.
[342:54.98]I can kind of live my life normally without having this just constant sort of tight, just aggravating pain right through the center of my back into my chest.
[343:09.78]But I'm good now.
[343:10.50]A lot of people are saying, take care of yourself.
[343:12.26]Do what you need to do.
[343:14.04]I already have.
[343:17.13]Guys, I used to stream for like seven to eight hours every time I turn the stream on.
[343:22.68]I would say I would at least be here for six to eight hours, seven to nine hours sometimes.
[343:27.74]I don't do that anymore.
[343:28.76]I just don't.
[343:31.50]So I've already made those changes.
[343:32.90]12 hour Simpsons stream.
[343:41.49]Sometimes they go longer than that.
[343:45.48]But this kind of, every two or three hours, get up and take a break, stretch, get some water, come back.
[343:52.78]Five, six hours goes by, and it's like, alright, I'm going to get up.
[343:57.94]So it's been working pretty well, I think.
[343:59.28]Because I can tell you right now, absolutely sitting for another two hours would not be good.
[344:06.23]It would be very bad.
[344:11.43]So sometimes I am going to cross that length, though, right?
[344:13.59]Like, seven hours, maybe like seven and a half.
[344:16.47]I think I streamed for like seven hours yesterday or something, right?
[344:22.71]Sometimes it's going to happen.
[344:24.70]But it's not going to be the norm anymore.
[344:30.96]But that was very, very stalling.
[344:32.66]He's stalling to end the stream, right?
[344:35.94]I am.
[344:37.04]But for a lot, some people might not know that that's kind of going on.
[344:42.98]There's a lot of new people here over the last couple of years.
[344:45.66]Especially the last six months.
[344:48.62]So, some of you newer viewers that may have just kind of started watching over the last year.
[344:52.55]Not sure if you've known some of you do, some of you don't.
[344:56.81]So, talk about it sometimes just to keep everybody up to date.
[345:01.19]But that's going to be it.
[345:02.61]I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[345:03.47]Thanks for all the subs, everybody.
[345:06.68]And there was some huge donations too.
[345:08.92]Thank you guys, seriously.
[345:09.50]Seriously.
[345:15.32]Next week will be interesting because there's a lot of highly recommended games that are probably going to happen.
[345:21.69]Probably going to play Sly Cooper.
[345:22.95]People have been waiting for that one.
[345:37.03]I'm playing the PS3 remastered one.
[345:39.65]That's okay, right?
[345:45.54]They didn't mess it up somehow in the remaster?
[345:48.58]Good?
[345:48.82]Okay.
[345:52.00]Thanksgiving Family Guy joke incoming.
[345:55.36]Well.
[345:56.84]No, I'm not even going to say anything.
[345:57.99]Because the reason why I was like two or three minutes late.
[346:01.67]I was here.
[346:02.03]I was here for like an hour or two before the stream.
[346:04.73]I was on the phone.
[346:06.19]I was on a call with my manager.
[346:07.65]To talk about a very specific stream.
[346:10.45]That we're starting to work on right now.
[346:14.79]So.
[346:18.05]That's why I was just like, I gotta fucking go.
[346:19.73]I gotta call my manager.
[346:26.98]Baseball.
[346:27.42]Baseball already is happening in 2021.
[346:28.98]I have talked to my manager about...
[346:42.87]so many projects over the 2020 that couldn't happen in 2020 that we wanted to do in 2020 so obviously because of covid so once covid is under control this there's so many things that are just back to back to back to back to back that I've already either done or almost done that 2021 should be it's ridiculous in regards to streams that I've wanted to do for a long time
[347:12.59]It's never gonna happen.
[347:13.34]I want you to remember that because just like the carnival, some of these things that I decide I want to do, I'm doing them no matter what.
[347:23.06]The one I'm talking about is happening no matter what.
[347:31.15]It's going to happen.
[347:32.33]Baseball especially.
[347:35.01]But when?
[347:35.49]I'll tell you when it happened.
[347:38.58]I'll let you know beforehand.
[347:39.76]Don't worry.
[347:41.89]What if society collapses?
[347:43.32]It's not... Look, I'm gonna do these streams before... The sides are not gonna collapse.
[347:46.78]Alright, I gotta... I have to feed Otto.
[347:52.01]Alright, yeah, yeah.
[347:52.43]People are like, go, go, go.
[347:53.43]Alright.
[347:54.53]I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[347:55.43]Take care of yourselves.
[347:56.15]Have a great rest of your night.
[347:57.09]Goodbye.
[347:57.97]Take care.
[347:58.71]Thanks for watching.
[347:59.33]That was Scribblenauts with Gerber985.
[348:43.93]Oh, God.
[348:45.15]Oh my God.
[348:45.75]Oh my God.
[348:46.15]Hold on.
[348:50.59]End of the stream chat picks the next stream.
[348:54.51]We did.
[348:54.97]That did happen.
[348:56.43]I did say that.
[348:58.37]Right.
[348:59.17]Okay.
[348:59.93]What is it?
[349:01.45]You guys stuck around for long?
[349:02.93]Son of a people, like, left.
[349:05.13]Alright.
[349:06.29]What's going on on the next stream?
[349:08.03]You wanna get a little poll going?
[349:09.99]Okay, let's do it.
[349:10.85]I like this getting up to walk out of the room.
[349:16.86]Alright, here comes the poll.
[349:22.16]Alright, seeing, uh... Signal Simulator.
[349:25.50]I'm not gonna play TF2.
[349:27.40]That's vetoed.
[349:35.56]No TF2, I don't, no, no TF2.
[349:41.91]Alright, Signal Sim.
[349:44.71]Sly Cooper.
[349:46.59]Let's get this right.
[349:47.75]This is for the next time I turn the stream on, by the way.
[349:50.73]You have the power here.
[349:52.37]Signal Sim, Sly Cooper.
[349:57.17]Hmm.
[349:59.19]Six grueling hours of Scribblenauts for this moment.
[350:05.51]Sometimes I feel like I have you guys, like, tied down to, like, an electric-ing chair.
[350:09.05]Uh, I just saw, okay, I saw Yakuza.
[350:17.73]Yaku, which, what Yaku, which one?
[350:23.65]I played Yakuza 0 for, like, a few hours.
[350:26.82]I already played, so you want me to go back to Yakuza 0?
[350:34.78]Or the new one?
[350:43.99]Go back.
[350:45.91]Yes, go back, go back, go back, go back.
[350:47.51]I'm begging you for Nancy Drew.
[350:48.92]Fine, it's going on the list.
[350:50.88]Alright, I'm just going to write like Yakuza question mark.
[350:56.22]Yakuza.
[350:59.06]The guy was begging me for what?
[351:00.02]Oh yeah, Nancy Drew.
[351:03.39]Or, let's see, a House Flipper DLC.
[351:05.55]Okay.
[351:13.92]Alright, we have a lot of categories here.
[351:15.90]We have a lot of nominees here.
[351:24.21]Not Doki Doki.
[351:25.47]You had your only chance to pick Doki Doki.
[351:28.49]And you guys didn't pick it.
[351:29.87]You dropped the ball on it.
[351:32.49]Slime Rancher.
[351:33.33]Okay, Slime Rancher is going on here.
[351:38.45]Alright, okay, alright, alright.
[351:39.77]This is enough.
[351:40.23]This is enough.
[351:41.33]We got one, two, three, four, five, six.
[351:43.22]By the way, we're not doing... We're not doing any elimination.
[351:46.52]No, okay, we'll do one... Okay, we'll do two elimination rounds.
[351:49.50]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[351:51.24]Two elimination rounds.
[351:52.22]Here's the first poll.
[352:01.69]Go for it.
[352:03.81]Let's see.
[352:11.83]Right off the bat, we have... Okay.
[352:16.13]I can't say any words.
[352:16.93]I can't mention anything.
[352:20.62]If I mention any of these, they will instantly get 100 votes.
[352:25.86]Even if I say that this X game is dog shit, it'll be clicked 100 times.
[352:38.06]Alright, okay.
[352:39.20]We have some eliminations.
[352:40.02]We're going to eliminate two things per round, by the way.
[352:42.78]That's how this works.
[352:45.04]The lowest two, based on vote, not on percentage, on vote count, are gone.
[352:58.84]Alright, I'm closing the first round in five, in ten seconds.
[353:02.51]Ten seconds.
[353:03.05]Closing the poll.
[353:03.71]Ten seconds.
[353:04.93]Ten.
[353:06.17]Nine.
[353:07.33]Eight.
[353:08.39]Seven.
[353:09.47]Six.
[353:09.73]Five.
[353:11.91]Four.
[353:12.87]Three.
[353:13.89]Two.
[353:15.01]One.
[353:16.07]Zero.
[353:16.37]That's it.
[353:17.73]What's lowest?
[353:18.73]Slime Rancher and Signal Sim.
[353:22.90]No, no, no, no, no.
[353:24.62]Slime Rancher and Yakuza?
[353:26.68]No, Slime Rancher and...
[353:29.13]There's still so many votes coming in.
[353:32.27]There's so many votes coming in.
[353:34.51]Hold on.
[353:34.77]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[353:37.79]I don't have to take a screenshot.
[353:38.53]I should have taken a screenshot.
[353:39.87]Alright.
[353:40.51]Here we go.
[353:40.81]I'm going to take a screenshot in 10 seconds.
[353:41.75]Alright.
[353:41.95]10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[353:42.15]That's it.
[353:44.32]Screenshot.
[354:02.39]That's it.
[354:05.85]What do we got?
[354:08.01]Okay.
[354:09.77]When I said that, here it is.
[354:13.20]The two that are getting eliminated are Slime Rancher and Signal Simulator.
[354:20.56]Those are eliminated from the running of next stream.
[354:27.09]The second round.
[354:29.19]He's coming in.
[354:29.67]Give me a sec.
[354:32.15]Round two.
[354:33.19]Another two will be eliminated this round.
[354:37.14]So, we still have Sly Cooper still on there.
[354:41.04]We still have Yakuza, whatever one, which I will decide.
[354:46.78]We still have Nancy Drew.
[354:51.67]Why the fuck is this still on here?
[354:54.97]How did this get more than 10 votes?
[354:57.27]And House Flipper DLC.
[355:03.55]Okay.
[355:04.25]Yakuza, Sly Cooper, Nancy Drew, or House Flipper DLC.
[355:07.15]Here we go.
[355:07.53]Same deal.
[355:09.81]I'm gonna take a screenshot.
[355:15.43]Please vote.
[355:22.73]Ooh.
[355:23.01]Ooh.
[355:27.51]Right off the bat, doesn't look good.
[355:31.79]Doesn't look good.
[355:39.04]This is gonna be tight because, I mean, one of those... We've got almost a tie between two of them, at least.
[355:55.74]Okay, I mean, it's getting to be a little more clear.
[355:58.72]I'm gonna do this one more time and then count to ten and take a screenshot.
[356:09.01]Ten.
[356:10.15]Nine.
[356:11.31]Eight.
[356:12.53]Seven.
[356:13.63]Six.
[356:14.81]Five.
[356:16.05]Four.
[356:16.99]Three.
[356:18.03]Two.
[356:19.11]One.
[356:19.71]That's it.
[356:20.47]It's done.
[356:23.45]Nancy Drew and Sly Cooper have been eliminated.
[356:29.47]It is now down to Yakuza or House Flipper DLC.
[356:39.16]Here we go.
[356:40.52]Final round.
[356:44.02]House Flipper DLC or Yakuza.
[356:50.42]Yakuza something.
[356:52.53]Here it comes.
[357:06.31]I feel like this is going to be very, very, very close.
[357:11.41]It's going to be extraordinarily close.
[357:13.05]Because you've got the House Flipper enthusiasts that... Oh, House Flipper, of course.
[357:18.21]I love that game.
[357:18.79]You love that game.
[357:19.79]But then you've got the Contrarians that are saying, I don't want... No more House Flipper.
[357:23.31]Like, we haven't seen Yakuza.
[357:25.02]Like, give us something different, right?
[357:26.24]Like, you've played House Flipper a thousand times.
[357:28.26]Let's play something else.
[357:29.02]I feel like it's going to be very close.
[357:37.88]Or not.
[357:39.02]Never mind.
[357:51.01]This is almost ready to call now.
[358:01.09]Somebody just wrote, I'm not going to that stream.
[358:06.64]Come on, dude.
[358:07.94]We're trying to be democratic about it.
[358:10.60]I'm trying to be democratic about this.
[358:13.38]I ain't going to that one.
[358:18.07]We'll go to the next one.
[358:19.93]Sly Cooper is going to be like after that.
[358:24.23]I'm giving this 10.
[358:25.11]Do I even need to give 10 seconds?
[358:27.51]It's going to take a Christmas miracle for Yakuza to pull this off.
[358:30.46]Down by 200 votes.
[358:31.44]That's it.
[358:32.08]That's it.
[358:46.49]I will be playing the House Flipper DLC on Wednesday.
[358:51.89]And then on Thursday, I will be playing Sly Cooper PlayStation 3 Remastered.
[358:58.45]And then on Friday... Hey.
[359:01.97]Hey, guys.
[359:03.31]Want to see how democracy works on this channel?
[359:06.87]Playing Yakuza on Friday.
[359:07.87]There's your schedule for the week.
[359:20.45]I'm not going to that one.
[359:22.29]Well, then there's no pleasing you.
[359:27.97]I'm not going to that one.
[359:28.97]I'm not going to that one.
[359:29.91]I'm not going to that one.
[359:30.85]I wanted Slime Rancher.
[359:32.49]Well, I'll play Slime Rancher eventually.
[359:34.63]Come on, Gwyn.
[359:42.79]It was Nancy Drew that I wanted.
[359:44.17]Well, I wanted Neopets.
[359:47.77]Okay, here, listen.
[359:50.05]If you want me to play Neopets so bad, but you know that stream is gonna be me, just, just like, I'm gonna buy a Neopet, and it's gonna, I'm gonna like, feed it like three times, I'm gonna throw a ball at it, and then all of you, all of you Neopets, enthusiasts, are going to tell me, ah, can we do something else?
[360:10.11]This sucks.
[360:10.93]We're just looking at a website the whole time.
[360:12.69]This is boring.
[360:14.01]Dude, Gerber, this stream sucks.
[360:18.42]And I'm going to be like, steam is going to come out of my ears.
[360:29.63]That's exactly what we want.
[360:30.80]Alright, I'll see you for House Flipper on Wednesday.
[360:41.41]And then I'll play Yakuza as well this coming week.
[360:44.59]Alright, now I actually have to leave now because Otto is like staring at me like, dude, what the fuck are you doing?
[360:49.23]You're just talking.
[360:50.33]You're just talking into this bright screen.
[360:53.36]Animals must think we're insane, by the way.
[360:55.10]Think about that.
[360:57.08]We sit in front of this bright screen that just makes loud noises at us.
[361:03.45]What the hell?
[361:04.11]Why are they, what are they doing?
[361:09.28]Alright, I'll see you guys Wednesday.
[361:10.08]I gotta go.
[361:11.12]Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
[361:12.18]Have a great rest of your weekend.
[361:13.98]Still one more Sunday left, right?
[361:16.76]Take care, guys.
[361:17.24]See you soon.
