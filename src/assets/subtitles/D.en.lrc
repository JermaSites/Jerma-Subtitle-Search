[00:00.91]I'm going to mute this for a second because this could be really loud.
[00:05.27]Hold on.
[00:06.53]Hold on there.
[00:08.20]I need to change the... Is this even on Twitch?
[00:14.08]I would assume probably not.
[00:16.80]I can't even write this because it thinks I'm trying to say Dota.
[00:23.13]There's no way.
[00:24.13]It's the letter D.
[00:28.68]That's it.
[00:29.08]It's just the letter D. So what do I do about this?
[00:34.84]I can't make it just the letter D. I'm not sure what to do.
[00:45.81]I'm going to put it as like the... Hold on.
[00:48.81]Let me do this.
[00:51.29]It's not dog phobia.
[00:52.29]It's just D. It's not here.
[00:54.87]I'm just going to have to keep it as...
[01:00.75]We're not playing a video game right now.
[01:09.77]Let me open it up.
[01:13.33]Here it comes.
[01:14.63]Hopefully it's not loud.
[01:15.53]It is!
[01:17.03]But you can't hear it.
[01:17.89]Only I can.
[01:19.27]So we're good.
[01:19.81]Here it is.
[01:25.43]D. The game.
[01:31.87]I don't know.
[01:32.63]We might be out of this one in 25 seconds.
[01:37.10]I don't know.
[01:38.04]Jesus Christ!
[01:41.94]A mass murder.
[01:45.64]I can't even read this.
[01:46.36]Give me a second.
[01:50.85]There we go.
[01:51.51]Now I can see.
[01:52.13]From downtown Los Angeles.
[01:53.47]D.
[01:58.53]I'm sorry.
[02:00.09]That's too- I can't do it.
[02:01.29]D!
[02:01.57]Who's dead?
[02:09.03]The criminal is one Richard Harris.
[02:12.15]And there he is.
[02:18.01]He used a- He used a motion tween to be able to take out three people.
[02:30.30]who is director of the hospital, I've been reading, has suddenly transformed into a mass murderer.
[02:38.53]Rector has seized a large number of hostages and barricaded himself into the hospital.
[02:44.27]Is this a scary game?
[02:45.27]The police cannot reach him, so they send in me.
[02:50.20]They send in Uma Thurman.
[02:51.94]Well, actually, his daughter, Laura, hears the news at school in San Francisco.
[03:01.36]Immediately she holds the microphone next to the car engine and steps on the gas.
[03:07.35]It has made her father reach into the scene of her tragedy.
[03:10.01]Did she get in?
[03:10.61]Am I supposed to be hearing noises?
[03:11.75]Yeah, good thing we all got Sonic.
[03:12.87]Alright, how do I get out of this?
[03:14.33]Can we play the game?
[03:15.17]I understand this is the game.
[03:36.04]Jesus Christ.
[03:39.72]There.
[03:40.30]That's better.
[03:45.75]There we go.
[03:46.39]There it is.
[03:47.67]Turn it down.
[03:48.29]We're good.
[03:51.21]D. You guys thought I was making it up.
[03:55.35]D. I don't have... It's just... This is it.
[04:04.23]We just watched a trailer for the whole game.
[04:06.17]That's what that was.
[04:07.13]We didn't even need to do that.
[04:07.89]Here's the actual opening cutscene to this fucking game.
[04:15.46]It's a Resident Evil 1 cutscene too.
[04:17.60]That's the quality we're talking.
[04:22.46]Los Angeles National Hospital.
[04:32.48]I'm going to need a walkthrough for this one.
[04:34.18]Oh, you mean I'm going to need to walk out of this one.
[04:41.88]I don't know if this is a third person game.
[04:43.32]This is a first person game.
[04:44.44]I don't think there's dialog in this game.
[04:52.78]This is going to be gasps and finger pointing.
[05:07.84]Taking our sweet time walking through this hospital.
[05:18.94]Stretching this out as far as we can.
[05:25.73]Where are the police?
[05:26.95]Didn't it say the police were outside and he has hostages and he's a murderer.
[05:32.31]So the police are going to send in the only one that can possibly solve this criminal...
[05:41.69]Huh?
[05:44.51]Behold!
[05:46.61]The iPad photo booth!
[05:49.73]You see how funny your chin just looked?
[05:54.22]Touch me!
[06:04.96]Oh my lord, okay.
[06:08.36]This is the game.
[06:09.92]Is it?
[06:10.96]How-
[06:15.63]Oh, it actually is the game.
[06:17.17]I actually have to move left and right with the keyboard.
[06:20.71]Oh boy.
[06:21.53]Okay.
[06:29.20]I can walk this way.
[06:31.20]It's just mist, but ugly.
[06:34.78]Although this is kind of scary though.
[06:36.24]Something could like jump out and grab us.
[06:40.56]You gotta give D at least one minute, guys.
[06:47.27]See?
[06:47.95]Laura.
[06:50.58]Laura.
[06:54.94]Laura.
[06:56.22]Bueller.
[06:57.84]Laura.
[07:00.96]This is your father.
[07:05.33]Laura.
[07:05.97]Hey, listen to me.
[07:07.35]That was a very agitated Laura.
[07:08.99]Go back.
[07:11.09]You must not cross over to this side.
[07:16.36]I love that I love that passive-aggressive Laura.
[07:21.79]It was perfect.
[07:23.47]She wouldn't answer him.
[07:27.55]So it's like hey Go back
[07:43.89]This world is not for you, Laura.
[07:46.51]We're not leaving now.
[07:50.97]I don't think there's any game.
[07:51.83]I think we just have to walk around and look at stuff.
[07:57.97]There's no inventory.
[08:00.33]There's no buttons.
[08:01.09]It's just walk in different directions and have a guy yell your name.
[08:05.97]I have to finish this game.
[08:07.51]I don't know if that's going to happen.
[08:11.56]Let's have a drink.
[08:14.43]Laura.
[08:16.39]Laura.
[08:17.93]Don't put your mouth on the spigot.
[08:20.55]You know your mother doesn't like that.
[08:31.46]It's a puzzle game?
[08:33.62]Is it a puzzle game?
[08:35.88]Well, let's solve the puzzle.
[08:42.68]Well, well, there's very clearly a dangerous situation right over there.
[08:48.48]Uh, the wall of spikes.
[08:51.34]Hmm.
[08:52.66]Hmm.
[08:53.32]Uh-oh, a hand.
[09:00.37]Is it dad again?
[09:15.09]He just, like, fed me like a fish.
[09:16.71]Okay.
[09:20.56]Has it been a minute yet?
[09:21.44]No, I'm not ready yet.
[09:24.02]I'm not ready to call it quits.
[09:25.22]We have to... Come on, guys.
[09:27.98]You gotta give me at least a minute here.
[09:33.77]You gotta give me at least a minute in Clyde Barker's Laura.
[09:45.72]No one walks like this.
[09:49.98]It's stomping on her heels.
[09:56.58]It's very eerie.
[09:57.66]I will give it that.
[10:11.87]Yeah, okay.
[10:14.07]Make sure you're careful in here.
[10:21.28]So wait, so there's two people got pushed in there and then somebody slammed the door closed.
[10:26.93]Well, that's a place I don't want to be.
[10:29.87]What's behind door number two?
[10:32.23]Is there a door number three?
[10:34.39]No, there's only a one and two.
[10:37.07]I just spun all the way around.
[10:40.74]Yeah, this must be a hospital.
[10:44.20]How is this a hospital?
[10:54.42]This game actually got a sequel.
[10:55.76]What is it called?
[10:56.48]D-minus?
[10:58.74]D-plus?
[11:00.67]D-two?
[11:09.88]Uh... There's gotta be something here.
[11:14.58]There's a key.
[11:16.78]Grab the key, watch out for the monster.
[11:22.03]Mm-hmm.
[11:23.45]Well... E. Yeah, this equals a D. E. It is called D2.
[11:38.84]It's called D2.
[11:39.66]E. Alright, well, at least I have a key now.
[11:56.58]D2.
[12:00.05]Well, good thing I didn't buy that one.
[12:03.17]I just own the original.
[12:05.51]It's a cult classic.
[12:11.51]So here's the deal.
[12:12.49]I'm going to go down the stairs.
[12:14.73]And, you know, it's going to be... The wall is going to Indiana Jones me.
[12:22.59]And I'm going to have to make a decision.
[12:32.31]They really are pushing that whole Resident Evil vibe thing where you walk very slowly.
[12:37.37]Right?
[12:39.51]I mean, like... I guess we're gonna go over here.
[12:42.15]Yeah, we have to run from the ball.
[12:45.47]We already saw it.
[12:46.13]We already saw, like, some of the scares.
[12:53.40]Only real gamers play.
[12:54.66]D2 is the third game.
[12:55.98]Enemy Zero is the second game.
[12:59.22]So they go from...
[13:01.14]want D to zero to two.
[13:04.30]Somebody should probably tell them that that's retroactively.
[13:09.72]It's not how it works.
[13:12.50]Fun fact, the third game is actually called Spy Kids 3D, but it came out two years before the first Spy Kids movie.
[13:20.26]D2 has guns?
[13:26.58]Alright, can you walk a little faster?
[13:29.55]I understand, like, atmosphere, but there's no way you would be moving this slow.
[13:37.17]Oh god, what is that?
[13:38.11]It's a golden beetle.
[13:44.53]Quick, break it!
[13:45.21]Get some Titanite!
[13:47.31]Make it worth it!
[14:01.83]Oh no, we're eating dinner and we're playing reverse circus music.
[14:09.37]Bugs are gonna crawl out of her mouth.
[14:10.73]D!
[14:17.13]D for deetle, beetle, beetles.
[14:27.60]Alright, let's open the door now.
[14:31.28]D for dinner.
[14:37.50]Of course every door is locked.
[14:40.14]Every single one.
[14:43.31]And it takes 25 seconds to go from yard 1 to yard 3.
[14:50.07]And now we're back at square 1.
[14:52.55]So what the hell was the point of me getting that key?
[14:55.53]How do I even open my inventory?
[15:01.83]That just scared the shit out of me.
[15:04.27]The you left the menu sound scared the fuck out of me.
[15:19.08]Press F button a minute.
[15:23.70]So what is the key for?
[15:25.34]It's gotta be the... The door in here.
[15:29.22]I definitely go over and unlock it, and then I have to quickly get through the door.
[15:33.08]Right?
[15:34.19]If I was a game designer, I would be... That was what I would do.
[15:43.41]Just look.
[15:44.75]That's... No, shit.
[15:49.73]What the hell am I supposed to do?
[15:55.48]You really want me to beat the game because there's a huge twist as to why it's called D. The spike room.
[16:07.95]Wasn't that the spike room?
[16:09.25]Am I missing something completely?
[16:10.61]Is there a key to open this door?
[16:16.04]I don't know.
[16:19.72]Bob Barker is undead.
[16:24.79]This is why interactive movies never caught on.
[16:30.42]It's next to the barrel.
[16:32.30]So it's not like in here.
[16:42.31]Alright.
[16:42.53]We're going to get this like another.
[16:43.73]I'm going to try like one more attempt.
[16:44.97]We're going to get this like one more minute.
[16:47.21]And then we're going to next.
[16:48.29]We're going to get out of here.
[16:53.80]Read the Wikipedia page if I got time.
[16:55.26]Alright, so down at the... I thought this was the spike room.
[16:59.26]Am I crazy?
[17:08.68]Can we just have a pee break instead?
[17:10.24]Actually, that's a good, you know, yes.
[17:12.76]We will have a pee break after I open up the spike door and everyone screams.
[17:30.05]go left now hold on I want to look at the spigot everyone's like screaming no no no the problem with that is everything's so slow that I'm losing track now hold on there's the spike wall
[17:58.39]So we walk by the spikes.
[18:01.20]Uh-oh.
[18:06.84]Did I just die?
[18:13.00]No, apparently not.
[18:18.82]Dad stopped him.
[18:24.41]No, hold on.
[18:24.79]I gotta reload it.
[18:26.23]Don't walk over here, please.
[18:27.33]I need to reload this thing.
[18:33.38]Should I not?
[18:34.72]You're just gonna have to run, right?
[18:36.54]Just run.
[18:36.96]I would be able to get by that.
[18:39.73]I would just dive.
[18:41.37]Just sprint and dive.
[18:53.78]No, it's not gonna let me do it.
[18:56.90]D for dive, that's right.
[18:58.26]Okay, well we can't go that way.
[19:04.46]The game doesn't want us to do that.
[19:08.80]I can't press the new buttons.
[19:14.81]Alright, this is where Dad reached out and like... tried to grab my face.
[19:21.81]Uh...
[19:26.96]Last ditch effort.
[19:27.88]I'm going up the stairs again.
[19:29.98]Last time and then we're going to get out of here.
[19:35.91]Did I pay?
[19:36.35]I did pay for this game.
[19:37.23]It's old.
[19:38.05]It's just old.
[19:38.49]There's no skip.
[19:41.45]There's no I've already seen this cutscene five times.
[19:47.57]Alright.
[19:48.01]We're going to go in.
[19:49.67]Somebody just said to go touch the dresser.
[19:53.38]That's what we're going to do.
[19:56.36]This has been so fucking boring.
[19:58.10]I'm so- I'm sorry!
[19:59.72]I need to see what I- What if like a spike went through my face there?
[20:02.66]That would have been so spooky Halloween stream.
[20:04.96]You know what I mean?
[20:07.42]Look, we're just gonna tune our guitar real quick.
[20:09.20]We'll be fine.
[20:14.11]Okay, um... What am I supposed to do with this?
[20:24.97]Double and two?
[20:28.44]There's nothing in two.
[20:34.99]What about one?
[20:37.73]There's a photo in one.
[20:43.19]Cool.
[20:56.13]D is the fourth letter of the alphabet.
[20:57.79]Let's get it.
[21:01.49]No, there's just like a samurai sword imprint.
[21:03.67]It's already been taken.
[21:07.07]Well, what's in five?
[21:08.49]There's gonna be like a gun in five.
[21:10.66]Or a snake.
[21:12.56]Nothing.
[21:16.16]What does the paper do?
[21:17.06]Why?
[21:17.40]The paper didn't do anything.
[21:22.42]D is for drawer.
[21:24.61]Jeezer drawer.
[21:25.49]Okay.
[21:27.35]Okay.
[21:29.09]That was fun.
[21:34.76]That was D the game.
[21:37.68]That was D the game.
[21:41.77]So I'm going to use the bathroom real quick.
[21:43.35]I'm going to pee.
[21:44.97]We'll go right back to this.
[21:46.63]I'll see you guys in like one minute.
[21:47.89]Take a pee break.
