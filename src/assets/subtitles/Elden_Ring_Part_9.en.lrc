[ve:60.16.100]

[00:06.40]Hey, how are you?
[00:08.66]How's it going?
[00:09.18]How have you been?
[00:13.58]It's been a little while since we've last seen each other's faces.
[00:20.13]I'm here.
[00:20.49]I'm good.
[00:23.35]Well, relatively good.
[00:26.63]Relatively good.
[00:31.87]Did I just send a tweet and reply to somebody?
[00:37.37]I hope not.
[00:37.97]Did I, in my speed, reply to somebody on my timeline to say that I was streaming?
[00:46.88]That'd be so fucked up.
[00:49.94]Ah, we're good.
[00:51.46]Yes, hello, you haven't seen me in over a week.
[00:53.32]There's a few reasons for that.
[00:56.24]One, if you didn't catch the streamer rewards, I was there.
[00:59.14]It was a really good time.
[01:03.31]Got to meet and network Andy with a bunch of people.
[01:06.87]Some people that I have already met and already knew, but some people I had never met before, and that was the first time I ever really said hello.
[01:15.52]It's a very, very good time.
[01:20.24]This guy that won two awards.
[01:22.94]Yeah, I... I guess... Hey, you know what?
[01:26.32]I guess so.
[01:27.30]I guess that... I guess I am... I am that person, aren't I?
[01:31.63]It's time to flex a little, okay?
[01:35.96]2022, no more like humble.
[01:37.14]No, I'm putting on a fucking muscle shirt and I'm flexing now.
[01:41.04]See what I'm talking about?
[01:52.66]I'm not ready.
[01:53.76]I'm not ready yet.
[01:54.42]Hold on.
[01:58.23]No, in all seriousness, there's a really, really tough category in both categories.
[02:03.13]It was a really great time.
[02:06.23]It was just really fun to be there.
[02:08.75]Anybody could have won those two categories.
[02:11.99]Seriously.
[02:14.31]And they're all cool people.
[02:15.75]That meant pretty much all of them besides the ones that weren't there.
[02:18.23]You need to explain Peppa Pig.
[02:24.52]They handed out coloring books, so I started coloring.
[02:29.88]I didn't bring a Peppa Pig coloring book to the Streamer Awards.
[02:34.62]They handed them out.
[02:40.37]Why am I good at public speaking?
[02:43.81]I don't know.
[02:44.45]Okay.
[02:47.49]You want to know how to actually public speak?
[02:51.17]You just have to pretend that everybody in the audience is your friend.
[02:54.75]And they're all there.
[02:56.93]You're just hanging out with your friends.
[02:59.78]That's one of the best ways to do it.
[03:02.52]You just literally pretend that everybody in the audience is like, oh yeah, I'm talking to like, I'm talking to Burger Boy.
[03:06.88]Yeah, he's just, it's all Burger Boys.
[03:11.42]It's just, it's just a audience full of Burger Boy.
[03:15.08]Which I would definitely not recommend.
[03:17.70]I would definitely, I would probably not attend that event.
[03:21.04]I would, I would hope that event would be like streamed so I could watch from a distance.
[03:25.00]I would not want to go to that event.
[03:30.36]But no, honest to God, I don't know.
[03:32.42]I don't think I'm really that good at public speaking.
[03:36.22]Just have something that you think you really want to say and just say it.
[03:39.40]And confidently say the things that you want to say, I guess.
[03:44.90]I was kind of nervous.
[03:46.34]It's kind of nerve wracking.
[03:48.75]You know, going up there and... There's just a sea of people that you know are... These people are... There's a lot of people in this audience right now.
[03:57.51]And a lot of them... Are, like, big streamers and people from the press.
[04:02.10]And it's like, I don't want to, like... I don't want to have, like, a booger come out of my nose and go into my mouth.
[04:06.94]In the middle of that, like, speech.
[04:08.84]Because then that's it.
[04:11.00]The second that a stray booger goes out in the mouth, and I go, it's like, okay, it's time to quit.
[04:19.05]So, like, every time, before public speaking, I mean, maybe I'm a weirdo, I always, like, make sure there's nothing in my nose.
[04:27.32]I always make sure my teeth are okay, there's no, like, boogers in my nose, because, I don't know, man, it's possible.
[04:34.39]Even if it's a 0.01% chance.
[04:38.58]That will be your legacy.
[04:40.33]Eating a booger accidentally on camera during a speech.
[04:48.95]You're taking notes.
[04:53.38]What?
[04:55.04]No, I'm just fucking kidding.
[04:56.72]I'm like, God, relax.
[05:04.10]I do that before coming on here too.
[05:06.41]You guys don't think that I make sure that I look clean?
[05:12.72]Anyways, I've been so, so ready to play Elden Ring.
[05:15.90]You have no idea.
[05:17.50]I'm going to tell you just how accurate that statement is.
[05:21.89]So I've been, last week I've had digestive problems.
[05:25.95]Those of you that don't know, I got diagnosed with like colitis and then proctitis and they thought it was Crohn's originally, right?
[05:32.53]Like I've had IBD bullshit for the last like 15, 20 years almost.
[05:37.27]I got a flare up.
[05:38.73]I don't know why.
[05:39.49]Sometimes every, maybe once every like
[05:42.39]Maybe once, twice a year it ends up happening.
[05:45.03]Stomach.
[05:45.45]Well, it's not really stomach.
[05:46.35]I don't want to pretend like it's a stomach thing.
[05:49.43]I have problems with my digestive tract.
[05:52.33]So, how long are we going tonight?
[05:55.53]As long as I can without needing to run away.
[05:59.41]I think I should be good.
[06:01.01]If I need to take a break somewhere in a few hours, I'll do kind of like we did last time, which is actually a pretty good idea.
[06:07.99]But,
[06:09.17]I have also, in the meantime, because if you see where we are right now, I have not moved on this character.
[06:16.10]I've probably played through Limgrave like eight times.
[06:21.33]Because I just want to play so bad.
[06:23.64]I have seen every last detail of Limgrave.
[06:28.24]Every one.
[06:29.32]I could tell you if you opened up just a naked map of Limgrave.
[06:33.96]Nothing there.
[06:35.18]I could tell you where every Grace is.
[06:36.54]I could tell you where every dungeon is.
[06:38.01]I could tell you where every NPC is.
[06:42.35]I just wanted to play so bad.
[06:43.41]So I was like, I don't want to see too much, though.
[06:45.33]But I guess I'll make a new character and go through Limgrave again.
[06:48.41]It's like, Jesus, man.
[06:50.37]I'm just glad to see something that's not like the Tree Sentinel.
[06:53.16]You know what I mean?
[06:54.46]You need to prove it.
[06:55.12]I don't have to prove anything.
[06:56.86]No.
[06:57.12]Because then, like, I'll miss something and people will be mad.
[06:59.34]All right.
[06:59.68]Anyways, here's what we're doing.
[07:01.08]You remember this guy?
[07:03.19]Baby Rattle?
[07:05.73]You need to play with me strong.
[07:10.66]I'm not going to play with me strong.
[07:13.14]No.
[07:15.95]No audio?
[07:16.77]Fuck.
[07:17.27]There you go.
[07:20.95]How come the character's a furry?
[07:22.07]The character's not... It's like a furry statue mask.
[07:24.93]Fine.
[07:25.25]I'll give you that.
[07:29.33]You promised me strong.
[07:30.69]I did not promise anything.
[07:33.49]We laughed about a scenario where... Because me strong is supposed to be just a naked guy with a club.
[07:40.14]And I want to try to just put every single point in strength and get the huge club and just be a caveman running around.
[07:46.22]And everyone was like, oh, that's really funny.
[07:49.83]And it's like, well, what if you were inebriated?
[07:53.41]I guess that makes it funnier that I'm just this guy with no health and like 80 strength.
[07:58.27]And try to kill the bosses in like four hits.
[08:01.39]And die.
[08:04.80]Imagine like a fucking caveman just running around.
[08:08.27]That's like the thing that people need to be concerned about.
[08:12.35]Oh, tarnished.
[08:14.53]It's just a naked guy with a club.
[08:15.98]All right.
[08:22.01]thing me mad yeah all right so I have to remember kind of what what I did last and what I remember is I remember I was in I was I was I was in a state of a little bit of delirious I remember you guys were like it was like hour number 12 or something and I was exhausted and I could I couldn't even like read and you guys are like oh keep going keep going and I was like all right fine I'll keep going and I killed a boss
[08:50.08]And then I... It was like, no, keep running up the tree!
[08:52.66]And I, like, ran up the tree and I killed another boss.
[08:55.88]Well, I didn't.
[08:56.42]The Mimic tier did.
[08:57.91]Then they nerfed it.
[08:59.01]So, that's not happening anymore.
[09:02.91]Ludwig wants to play Fortnite with you?
[09:07.19]We're doing a thing in a week or so.
[09:10.93]You want to see my games that I might be picking for this little event?
[09:18.15]I wonder what I might be.
[09:19.47]Wait, is Ludwig picking Fortnite?
[09:27.26]That's not one of the games Ludwig is doing, right?
[09:29.96]It's not Fortnite.
[09:32.84]Oh, God.
[09:33.72]Okay, well, I got a few picks myself.
[09:38.61]Okay, so I... That'll be interesting, though.
[09:42.54]Alright, I need to figure out.
[09:44.04]It's been a while.
[09:45.18]Okay, so my entire experience so far, the last, like, nine days has been this area.
[09:51.60]And maybe, like, a little bit of here.
[09:54.16]But I kind of, like, have a ton of time that I, like, my hard drive got overwritten because all I know is Limgrave.
[10:03.83]Everything else got deleted.
[10:05.57]So I believe the last thing that I did...
[10:09.81]I killed Morgoth, and then I, like, turned the stream off.
[10:12.34]So let's just, let me just, let me just go here, right?
[10:16.74]Yeah, I couldn't get into the Erd tree.
[10:19.20]And then that lady sat down, and she was like, oh, we can get in there eventually, I guess, if you go here, right?
[10:25.49]Oh, wait, no, no, no, it was marked.
[10:27.73]Okay, so this is where I need to go, but is that where I'm going to go?
[10:34.65]This is a Limgrave expert.
[10:36.43]I would say so.
[10:38.68]So this is where I have to go.
[10:39.86]But is that where necessarily I'm going?
[10:42.68]What is this?
[10:43.84]The rolled route.
[10:45.06]I'm going to be very honest.
[10:48.56]There was a bunch of shit in this capital that I did not see.
[10:51.32]And I really want to see it.
[10:52.70]I'm level 98.
[10:53.44]Oh.
[10:53.62]Do I have any crunchies?
[11:00.17]Oh shit.
[11:00.67]I have this.
[11:04.19]Oh, wait.
[11:05.69]I did just, like, fucking turn the stream off, didn't I?
[11:09.06]I did.
[11:11.34]I didn't even go back to the round table.
[11:14.48]Okay.
[11:19.86]Go explore the capital?
[11:20.74]Yeah, I was going to go do that first.
[11:23.12]This is also going to be a long one.
[11:28.09]And I'll tell you why, because I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to stream tomorrow.
[11:32.08]The idea was to stream tomorrow, do like more Elden Ring, because I'm an Elden Ring streamer.
[11:36.84]It's the only thing I play.
[11:39.50]So, you know, you go to the volcano.
[11:43.95]Okay.
[11:45.79]So I might, we might do a super stream today, at least like eight to ten hours.
[11:50.45]I want to play Elden Ring, you know what I mean?
[11:52.53]Like, I don't, I am, my body is going to have to take a back seat here.
[11:58.35]I want to play Elden Ring, and I want to play it on stream.
[12:01.69]So if I have to diarrhea... TMI... Why did I just say that?
[12:10.37]It's been like nine days since I've streamed.
[12:11.91]I forgot, like, I can't say everything on stream.
[12:16.56]I forgot, like, sometimes I forget that, like, there's a camera on me.
[12:19.36]And there's, like, a bunch of people here.
[12:20.62]But you know what I mean?
[12:21.26]Like, if I have to go and get, like, a drink... If I have to, like, go, like, take a quick BRB... Then maybe I will.
[12:26.94]Whatever.
[12:27.32]Who cares?
[12:29.18]I'm gonna be fine.
[12:30.66]What did he just say?
[12:31.90]Oh shit.
[12:32.28]Oh!
[12:32.40]We got something to talk about here.
[13:00.70]They buffed the fuck out of Sorcery.
[13:04.71]Sorcery got a massive buff.
[13:07.26]Almost every spell.
[13:09.54]So if you don't know, patch 1.03 came out.
[13:12.20]They nerfed a few things.
[13:13.26]By the way, this is not one of the things that they nerfed.
[13:18.28]I saw a lot of people that were very upset about this.
[13:21.71]Where is it?
[13:23.05]Where is it?
[13:24.63]Come on.
[13:25.37]I know everyone's going to revile back when they see it on screen.
[13:28.85]They didn't nerf the moon veil.
[13:30.09]The moon veil is still great, isn't it?
[13:33.01]They did nerf the Mimic tier.
[13:35.67]And a few other things, right?
[13:36.77]A few other, like, combos.
[13:39.49]Spell combos or whatever.
[13:41.15]But Sorcery got a big buff.
[13:42.81]Almost every spell got its mana reduced and some of its damage increased.
[13:47.39]So maybe we have to lean into Sorcery.
[13:53.54]Wait, Moonville got a stealth nerf.
[13:55.42]Really?
[13:57.98]Really?
[13:58.68]What is it?
[14:00.08]What's the stealth nerf?
[14:03.35]Alright, let's get into this.
[14:04.93]I don't want to overwhelm myself with a bunch of bullshit.
[14:07.47]I'm using the baby rattle.
[14:10.45]I'm almost at plus 10 baby rattle, which is max.
[14:15.44]I'm here for... Whoa, that was weird.
[14:17.22]Alright, we're definitely going to have to get the boys up.
[14:19.14]Because I definitely want to utilize them a little more.
[14:23.92]Okay.
[14:26.46]Because if the mimic tier is not going to be a thing anymore...
[14:30.66]If this got nerfed, which I put all of my shit into, and it's not that good anymore, then we're gonna have, we gotta pivot here.
[14:37.08]We're gonna have to get the boys up.
[14:43.65]The Mimicatier is still good.
[14:45.01]Well, it's a different currency, so it's fine.
[14:52.03]Alright, so what's new?
[15:03.66]Oh yeah, this guy over here.
[15:10.70]Oh yeah, that guy died.
[15:12.66]Somber miner's bell bearing.
[15:14.22]When did I get this?
[15:20.07]Oh, I can buy somber smithing stones up to four.
[15:24.79]That's a big deal.
[15:26.29]And I can buy this glove ward as well.
[15:30.56]Very cool.
[15:30.94]Alright, let's just go.
[15:32.02]Let's just go.
[15:32.48]Let's go.
[15:32.76]Mimic's still good.
[15:33.64]I'm pleased to know that Rodan was nerfed.
[15:40.92]What did they do to Rodan?
[15:43.20]Oh, talk to the finger reader, yeah.
[15:47.32]Why does he look like he had his head hanging out of a car window in the wind?
[15:52.98]I don't know, dude.
[16:05.30]The Urge Tree has spurned you.
[16:08.02]What do you mean?
[16:10.31]They went into standby mode?
[16:30.81]But thousands, if not tens of thousands of moons must first pass.
[16:39.26]No matter for me.
[16:41.60]But you, how will you ever manage the weight?
[16:47.16]My, oh.
[16:49.40]You know what I never understand about these grand overarching video games and stuff?
[16:53.73]It's always the most powerful deities, the most powerful beings, the most intelligent god sage-like beings apparently don't fucking know that there's a door in front of the Erd Tree.
[17:08.87]How can you fuck that?
[17:09.87]How do you fuck that up so badly?
[17:13.09]This all-knowing entity that converses with the greater will doesn't know that there is a thing in front of the Erd Tree.
[17:20.69]You think that you would have known that already?
[17:22.78]Like 10,000 years ago?
[17:29.96]Oh, what a turn of events!
[17:31.50]I can't believe you can't get through the front door!
[17:34.34]Let me spend 10,000 years up here trying to figure out how to get you in the front door.
[17:42.21]I want to burn the... Oh, that's right!
[17:46.37]She sat down, right?
[17:47.27]And she's like, oh, I want to burn the tree or something.
[17:49.65]It's been a while.
[17:57.46]That's his magical sword.
[18:02.82]Regal Omen Barn.
[18:08.50]That's it.
[18:09.20]Int and Faith.
[18:10.48]Aye.
[18:12.22]Int and Faith.
[18:13.30]B for both?
[18:18.84]This sword is arcane in dex.
[18:20.08]I can't use it.
[18:22.94]I need Int.
[18:25.20]That's a CSGO knife.
[18:29.39]Yeah, this is a usable item, but... Oh, is it... How... Is it any good?
[18:35.62]I'm not getting the good scaling, right?
[18:36.84]Because I don't have any, uh... Faith?
[18:41.26]CS go knife.
[18:45.05]I don't know.
[18:45.75]I don't think... All the usable items are...
[18:49.79]like they have some utility but it's more of a look at this cool okay this is the kind of item that you you do pvp with and you just use it to be different and people go whoa wow you're using that's a cool thing to use I mean I'm gonna r1 you four times you're dead but that was cool what you did there that was a nice I know I haven't seen anybody use that yet so I I'm just gonna get the runes
[19:17.08]This is really cool though.
[19:18.66]This makes me want to make a like Dex Arcane character.
[19:26.77]I do that.
[19:27.23]Stop shitting on me.
[19:28.39]I do it too.
[19:28.97]I'm just saying that we know what we're doing.
[19:33.19]I want to burn the impenetrable thorns I want to burn the tree
[19:54.76]This thing's just like stuck in standby mode So why didn't you guys figure this out before I got here?
[20:02.28]I've been walking around the whole world
[20:27.28]They're not trying to help you.
[20:29.95]I don't know who's good and who's evil in these games.
[20:32.67]Wait, we're talking about...
[20:55.81]All right, this would be amazing.
[20:58.03]Now, I hope you hear a toilet flush.
[21:00.71]Like in the background.
[21:01.62]And then the fingers start moving.
[21:04.22]I'm back.
[21:05.38]For my 10,000 years of confession of the greater will.
[21:11.02]Okay, how do I burn it?
[21:12.10]You're a dog barking in the background.
[21:15.54]Like a Zoom call.
[21:38.70]There are like 30 endings in this game, okay?
[21:42.28]I couldn't get in the front door.
[21:43.44]Fingers are pissed about it, and I'm gonna burn the tree down.
[21:48.99]I guess.
[21:50.59]So we're gonna crush that thing.
[21:53.75]Interesting though.
[21:59.87]Okay, um, how many souls am I going to get for this?
[22:05.29]100,000.
[22:05.31]30.
[22:05.35]That guy was not very strong, apparently.
[22:17.48]Alright, uh, well, how does my character look?
[22:21.92]Maybe more into mind, endurance?
[22:24.08]I got 50 intelligence.
[22:27.16]25 Dex.
[22:28.88]40 Vigor.
[22:30.18]I don't know.
[22:31.16]Endurance, maybe?
[22:34.92]Maybe some more mana?
[22:39.07]I have 15 Endurance, Omega Lull?
[22:41.39]Yeah.
[22:43.83]Yeah.
[22:44.69]I mean, yeah.
[22:46.73]That's pretty bad.
[22:47.51]That's, like, really bad.
[22:52.94]Yeah.
[22:53.52]I mean, that's, like, really bad, isn't it?
[22:59.20]Okay.
[23:00.24]I am ready to move.
[23:01.46]I'm in a position where I think I'm good.
[23:04.00]I'm ready to move.
[23:04.64]Sorry that took a little longer, but I needed to kind of figure out what the hell was going on and where I was.
[23:09.08]And I mean, the last time I played it was like 10 days ago.
[23:12.76]Unless you're talking about Limgrave.
[23:14.07]All right.
[23:15.39]I remember here.
[23:17.97]Here.
[23:20.77]There was a place to go down and there was a big dragon hand.
[23:23.61]And I remember saying to you guys, I want to do that when I come back.
[23:27.34]So here we are.
[23:32.85]Alright.
[23:36.73]Let me head down here.
[23:37.95]I think this is where I need to be.
[23:41.37]No, where is it?
[23:45.21]I gotta get this stuff burnt back into memory of where I am.
[23:50.98]Is it not this one?
[23:54.74]Oh, this is right?
[23:55.28]Is it right?
[23:56.68]I thought it was.
[23:59.02]Oh my god, I thought that was a fucking enemy.
[24:00.68]I was like, what?
[24:01.80]Do I have to fight that thing?
[24:03.47]Uh, I think I'm gonna go down.
[24:07.21]Let's see.
[24:08.25]It's really hard to navigate the capital.
[24:10.19]Um, I thought I kind of knew what I was doing.
[24:13.19]But it's just been a while.
[24:14.78]I'll check down here.
[24:26.52]Oh shit, wait, okay, hold on.
[24:27.85]I see an item over there.
[24:33.20]I got Wicked Bag Glare on my screen right now.
[24:35.44]It's fucking me up.
[24:47.19]These guys suck.
[25:04.82]this is the best side everyone that we were talking a lot of shit about the baby rattle but it's very good are the awards on the shelf they are not I actually actually forgot him but it's okay community jake is on the case I'm gonna get him there I had him
[25:35.92]I had him, and then two or three cocktails later, I didn't.
[25:45.68]Oh, that's right.
[25:46.21]I climbed up this.
[25:48.31]Shit.
[25:48.51]Alright.
[25:48.99]Easy, easy, easy.
[25:50.83]So, if I go... Can I go down from here?
[25:52.19]Is this the right way?
[25:56.47]I don't think so.
[25:57.37]What about the other side?
[26:02.97]Is this where I wanted to go?
[26:04.37]This has to be, right?
[26:09.38]I think that's where I needed to go.
[26:11.10]Yeah, because there was a big arm on the ground and it was cool looking.
[26:13.86]Okay, let's go.
[26:14.44]Look at this fucking glare on the screen.
[26:26.69]Is he supposed to be hiding?
[26:35.55]What the fuck?
[26:36.93]Should I go down here?
[26:37.61]Alright, I'm going down here.
[26:38.91]We're gonna fight in this thing.
[26:41.13]I got this... I got this glare that I gotta take care of.
[26:43.45]Give me one second.
[26:45.67]It's a... It's a... This room is glaring.
[26:57.70]Better?
[27:02.64]I think that's better.
[27:03.60]Yeah.
[27:08.34]Uh, there we go.
[27:12.18]Address losing the awards.
[27:13.38]I didn't lose them.
[27:14.32]They just were put in a box and then I left the box.
[27:18.41]And I forgot to take the box.
[27:20.63]So, we're good.
[27:21.81]We're good.
[27:22.21]Community Jake is on the case and he has confirmed that I got him.
[27:26.27]We're good.
[27:26.65]We're good.
[27:26.99]We're fine.
[27:29.91]Alright.
[27:30.43]I'm... Let's go.
[27:32.43]Fuck it.
[27:32.65]I'm going down.
[27:37.03]Wait, you don't come down?
[27:39.97]Oh, that's not what I would- that's not what I anticipated.
[27:44.49]We're fine.
[27:44.89]Climb!
[27:53.23]You do melt them down?
[27:54.37]Oh, I didn't melt them down.
[27:58.94]They're not- I wouldn't want to melt them down.
[28:00.78]They're not made out of a material that would be safe to do that.
[28:04.67]I feel like I wouldn't want to breathe the air in the room that I did that in.
[28:09.37]Alright, where's he at?
[28:10.17]Can he fire up here?
[28:17.97]Fuck, he can fire up here.
[28:19.51]Alright, whatever.
[28:20.13]Stop!
[28:34.13]Oh, they made Comet better.
[28:36.41]I don't know why it sounded like that.
[28:38.40]It sounded like a weird, like, talk show host.
[28:39.94]Like a radio host.
[28:50.76]Why am I doing it like this, by the way?
[28:52.96]Just go down there and fucking attack him.
[28:54.90]Go!
[28:55.18]I don't have any mana.
[29:07.29]Alright, that was so simple.
[29:08.55]I don't know why I made that way too complicated.
[29:15.84]Alright, so there's nothing down here.
[29:19.02]Maybe he's blocking the path?
[29:20.40]I don't know.
[29:23.00]Intriguing.
[29:23.50]Are you going to use the guide for the remaining quests?
[29:27.93]No, I don't think so.
[29:30.61]Look, this game is so unbelievably ridiculous that... Playing through the game again... Look, I have like four characters that are ready to get out of Limgrave.
[29:41.11]Um... So... Playing the game another two or three times and experiencing more stuff... I kind of want to leave it.
[29:48.64]I kind of want to leave it.
[29:54.06]I'd like to experience more stuff with other characters.
[29:59.47]Okay, so that's... I can't go there, but let's try over here.
[30:07.07]So people that are saying, oh dude, you're gonna go back and do like every single secret boss and secret thing and you're gonna go clear out every... Probably not, no.
[30:14.94]I don't think so.
[30:19.00]I think that's fun to be able to experience it again with another character and just do different stuff that I didn't do.
[30:26.38]That's good.
[30:34.40]He hates Elden Ring.
[30:35.63]I can go up here.
[30:48.84]There are noises coming from over here.
[31:06.38]I get to... Wait, I was already down here, wasn't I?
[31:16.15]Wasn't I already down here?
[31:16.97]There's like one of those killers, the Omen killer people were here.
[31:19.83]Are you going to do a Wretch playthrough?
[31:32.47]I don't know.
[31:34.98]Wretch playthroughs are awesome, but you end up, like, hating the game in the first hour or two, and every time I've ever tried to do Wretch, or whatever they call it in the other games, I go, oh, this is awesome, man, I get to start at base level 10 with everything, that's perfect.
[31:48.81]And then I start playing the game, and I get killed in, like, two hits by something, or I can't hurt something, and I go, this is fucking stupid.
[31:55.25]Why did I ever do this?
[31:56.83]Like, what a dumb thing to do.
[31:58.01]Just pick one of the normal characters, and I, like, flip out.
[32:08.39]I didn't go down here.
[32:16.92]Isn't me strong a wretch?
[32:19.12]Yeah, but that was only because I had to do me strong as a wretch because they start with the fucking club.
[32:23.76]That's a different scenario.
[32:28.54]Alright, let's go this way.
[32:33.55]Wretch is enjoyable in this game.
[32:37.87]Is it?
[32:40.58]I don't think so.
[32:41.20]Fuck you.
[32:48.29]Poison bone dot.
[32:49.13]How come you don't know how to put a suit on?
[32:54.53]I know how to put... Alright, first of all.
[33:00.82]I... Okay, I know how to put a suit on.
[33:05.50]I just don't wear them that often.
[33:08.64]I hate these enemies.
[33:13.12]I have not had a reason to put a suit on in a long time.
[33:16.07]Don't you understand?
[33:16.77]What?
[33:22.09]Why did that happen?
[33:29.88]No!
[33:44.25]Oh my god!
[33:56.24]I actually hate this enemy.
[33:58.96]I'm out of fucking juice.
[34:08.90]Fighting the guys in this hallway is so bad, by the way.
[34:16.01]You can't go anywhere.
[34:16.61]And I need my lantern or starlight or something.
[34:19.79]I can't see anything.
[34:31.75]Yeah, I don't know.
[34:33.75]Hold on.
[34:34.73]Skin's coming out of my mouth.
[34:37.89]I still haven't done anything with those either.
[34:39.15]No?
[34:44.11]No?
[34:51.05]Did I get the lantern?
[34:52.19]I feel like I didn't buy it.
[34:54.76]And every time I don't buy it, you guys remind me to buy it, and I go, nah, it's alright, dude, I got fucking starlight!
[35:00.92]And then I don't put it on, and I'm just walking around in darkness.
[35:09.06]What's your favorite?
[35:09.56]Lunchable or the original?
[35:11.59]I believe it was ham, cheese, and crackers.
[35:13.21]That's it.
[35:15.69]None of this, I don't, all this new bullshit.
[35:19.03]Oh, like pizza in like a fucking tube or whatever the hell it is.
[35:24.54]No.
[35:25.24]Excuse me.
[35:26.34]Ham, cheese, or turkey and cheese.
[35:28.20]The little circles.
[35:29.52]Nothing else.
[35:30.14]Please don't give me any of that.
[35:31.22]Oh, they're like tacos.
[35:33.90]What the fuck are you talking about?
[35:34.96]That's zoomer food?
[35:47.15]I mean, it's food for kids.
[35:49.35]I don't know if it's necessarily zoomer food.
[35:53.23]Zoomer food.
[35:56.82]I mean, I ate that when I was young and I'm not a zoomer.
[36:10.46]Alright, I gotta get back there.
[36:22.77]I am so strong.
[36:25.79]Although, I'm probably going to... That confidence is probably going to disappear very soon.
[36:35.99]Oh, this is where he was.
[36:36.83]Alright, so what... Is there anything else down here?
[36:41.37]What else is down here?
[36:47.18]You're out leveled for this area?
[36:50.22]Yeah.
[36:52.02]But I did a lot of exploring early in the game.
[36:55.08]That's fine though.
[36:55.98]I don't care.
[36:59.24]Level 98.
[36:59.48]99.
[36:59.50]Alright.
[37:00.37]How do I get that?
[37:01.79]How do I get that item?
[37:18.76]Shit, okay, so I don't think I can do anything else down here.
[37:21.70]I'm just gonna go up Unless did I go this yeah, I did no I didn't okay My thoughts in the game so far It's I I don't need I don't really don't even know what to say anymore.
[37:40.42]It's not like nothing compares I
[37:43.32]If you guys found it, like, funny, okay, you know, isn't there, like, still, like, 400 plus thousand concurrent players playing this game right now?
[37:51.58]I think, like, everybody's just been sort of waiting for a game like this for, like, a fucking decade.
[37:59.38]Even Dark Souls 3, right, was, like, good.
[38:01.91]It was cool.
[38:02.69]That was fucking fun.
[38:03.81]But Sekiro was good.
[38:06.41]It was fun.
[38:06.97]It was challenging.
[38:07.69]It was hard.
[38:09.85]I mean, I don't know.
[38:10.89]I feel like I haven't played a game like this in a decade.
[38:13.71]Guilty hood?
[38:19.38]First, put a cloak of olive brown.
[38:27.32]Okay.
[38:27.94]Doesn't really do anything.
[38:28.72]What does it look like?
[38:35.42]That's cool.
[38:36.80]I mean, I need... I want the... What's the intelligence, right?
[38:41.05]Yeah, this one.
[38:43.64]Uh, I mean, the issue, I think, is that so many people have been waiting for, I think, what a lot of people can say.
[38:51.84]Let me say, let me say, I think, let me say, I think like 10 times, more times in a row.
[38:56.42]So, open world games have become sort of a formula, formulamatic,
[39:03.39]thing, right?
[39:04.27]I think this made the open world concept a lot cooler, because it's sort of, it's not the way that normal open world games play.
[39:16.38]You kind of just have to go explore.
[39:17.66]You have to go figure it out on your own.
[39:20.10]And something about that is so overwhelming, but so welcoming at the same time.
[39:25.71]Because nobody is telling me where I have to go and it's like fucking terrifying.
[39:30.03]Because you'll accidentally walk into some place that you might not- maybe it shouldn't be.
[39:35.19]And it's this horrifying but equally like interesting experience.
[39:39.65]Where you kind of did that to yourself.
[39:43.47]Even if you- it's not that different.
[39:45.33]Yes, it is!
[39:47.91]Sorry.
[39:50.35]Sorry, I thought you- I thought you- I thought that we were on Reddit.
[39:52.57]I thought you replied to me on Reddit.
[39:58.17]Okay.
[39:59.07]I'm alright.
[40:00.03]I'm okay.
[40:03.72]I did this.
[40:04.20]I remember this.
[40:08.82]Reddit brain.
[40:10.72]But it... Okay, it's not that different.
[40:13.45]But everything feels like it's in its place.
[40:16.01]Okay.
[40:16.85]Everything feels like it was hand-placed.
[40:20.31]Like, everything does.
[40:21.85]From the starter area to the later areas to walking around, everything feels hand-placed.
[40:26.51]Hand-made.
[40:27.57]Like this was crafted out of fucking clay.
[40:32.94]Everyone's saying Breath of the Wild.
[40:34.56]I haven't played Breath of the Wild yet, so let me experience that and I'll give you my... No, because then people are going to be pissed.
[40:41.36]Alright, that was not... Did I fucking miss anything down here?
[40:43.90]I think I cleared it.
[40:52.35]Play it, play it, play it.
[40:56.75]But what if I play Breath of the Wild and I stream it?
[41:00.11]And I'm sitting there as Mr. Streamer Mode trying to desperately say, Oh, fuck.
[41:06.93]I don't like this.
[41:15.62]And then I'm going to have to be like, It's okay.
[41:19.24]It's pretty good.
[41:20.56]I like it.
[41:22.43]And then they're gonna go, he's lying.
[41:23.39]He hates it.
[41:24.71]And then I'm gonna like stop playing it in two days.
[41:28.11]And I'm gonna lose 50,000 fucking dude.
[41:32.60]That's what I'm scared of.
[41:37.36]I probably would actually really like it.
[41:43.92]What's this?
[41:44.88]Do I have this?
[41:47.68]Oh shit.
[41:48.18]Is this down or up?
[41:49.14]Do I have this?
[41:51.95]Fuck, it's just literally this.
[41:57.26]It's just... I could have climbed up there with my fingernails.
[42:03.34]Why do you think you'll hate it so much?
[42:04.42]No, I really don't think I will.
[42:06.25]I think I would probably love it a lot.
[42:12.07]Alright, I'm... I need to get to that fucking area with the arm.
[42:17.65]I gotta go over there with...
[42:20.86]It's been too long.
[42:21.56]I don't remember.
[42:22.42]I gotta go like that.
[42:24.54]Where's the dragon?
[42:27.10]The dragon has like an arm on the ground.
[42:30.08]So it has to be this way.
[42:31.18]It has to be up in that area over there.
[42:33.53]By the boss.
[42:35.55]Right?
[42:38.17]This dragon has an arm that's on the ground.
[42:39.73]Fuck.
[42:43.85]I don't know where it is.
[42:46.89]Let me go over here.
[42:52.04]Let me go backwards from here.
[42:53.04]It's just like, I can't remember.
[42:54.48]Where are you trying to go?
[42:57.04]I'm trying to, there was a place like kind of down the bottom.
[43:00.00]Where the dragon, like a big long dragon arm is on the ground.
[43:03.36]And I remember looking down there and thinking it was important.
[43:08.15]I feel like it's out here.
[43:13.31]Like this way maybe?
[43:15.75]Should find, top, top, top, top, what?
[43:21.02]Okay, I remember running by... Yep, I ran by this.
[43:26.96]Go down the well.
[43:27.84]There's a site of grace near the main road.
[43:30.81]You need to go down the well.
[43:33.99]Okay, hold on.
[43:38.33]Let me go backwards from here.
[43:39.29]Because I...
[43:41.37]You know the reason why I didn't put this into memory at all is because I actually just sprinted through this whole area to fight the two bosses.
[43:47.20]I'm like deliriously tired.
[43:49.42]So I think I just need to go backwards.
[43:52.41]And just play from here.
[43:53.59]There's a well under the dragon.
[43:57.11]Oh shit, alright.
[43:57.79]How do I get that?
[44:10.31]Sun's out, guns out.
[44:11.75]That's right.
[44:14.72]Okay, I fought Godfrey in this room.
[44:16.60]I remember that.
[44:19.00]And this went around here.
[44:21.76]Let me go down this way.
[44:22.64]There's all these dead finger ladies.
[44:31.88]Don't listen to them about the well.
[44:32.80]They're trolling you.
[44:33.48]I mean, I'll find it.
[44:39.50]Holy grease.
[44:40.06]Okay.
[44:40.34]Times six?
[44:41.04]Jesus.
[44:41.40]Okay, now from here.
[44:45.73]How do I go down from here?
[44:47.03]This is smoke.
[44:54.13]Grace in here.
[44:54.89]What's out here?
[44:59.71]Ah, this is where the roots go.
[45:00.93]This is how I went up the first time.
[45:06.33]Yeah, okay.
[45:07.10]I remember this.
[45:11.07]That led all the way up there.
[45:13.29]So, let me rock down here.
[45:14.22]Did I play the Demon's Souls remake?
[45:17.38]No, because getting a PlayStation 5 is impossible.
[45:21.74]So, I unfortunately have not played it.
[45:25.10]I have absolutely no idea how good it is.
[45:28.87]I'd love to maybe experience it one day.
[45:30.71]Alright, I think I'm close.
[45:39.14]I just don't want to miss anything super important, right?
[45:40.96]Okay, I want that.
[45:46.94]Can I get up there?
[45:50.05]Oh my god, what have I done?
[45:56.03]What happened?
[45:56.63]What?
[45:58.09]Who killed him?
[46:06.04]What?
[46:09.45]Oh, this move is so good.
[46:10.61]This move is so good.
[46:12.19]This baby rattle is fucking unbelievable.
[46:14.39]It really is.
[46:14.93]Look at the damage on it.
[46:18.68]The scaling.
[46:22.00]Oh, I... Oh.
[46:24.90]Wait.
[46:25.96]Have I been here?
[46:28.02]Didn't I... Did I kill that?
[46:30.74]I didn't.
[46:31.10]Alright.
[46:31.46]So this is new.
[46:33.02]This is new.
[46:33.48]This is new info.
[46:34.42]Alright, I got new info.
[46:35.34]I haven't been here yet.
[46:37.55]Let me fight this.
[46:44.80]Please show.
[46:45.36]No.
[46:47.51]Oh, there's seeds over there.
[46:48.39]Alright.
[46:48.85]Nice.
[46:49.05]This is why I didn't want to just run.
[46:50.07]I didn't want to just disappear from here.
[46:56.55]Is it aggro everybody?
[46:57.25]I had to get rid of these guys quick.
[47:06.84]Oh boy.
[47:07.26]Get out of here.
[47:17.77]Shut your fucking party horns up!
[47:27.51]Jesus Christ!
[47:46.82]Stupid idiot!
[47:57.29]Is he healing?
[48:04.22]Why do I feel like he's healing?
[48:05.04]I hit him with a 1500!
[48:38.95]Gargoyle's Halberd.
[48:49.38]C and E scaling.
[48:53.55]Cool.
[48:54.89]Bronze halberd wielded by valiant gargoyle.
[48:57.93]Just like the wielder, the missing parts have been mended with corpse wax, a patchwork of champions.
[49:06.56]Is that unique?
[49:08.74]I don't think that's a unique move.
[49:13.64]Is this the guy that growled at chat and turned purple?
[49:23.04]Yes, it is.
[49:23.52]I fucking can't believe... That's gotta be one of the... I don't even know what to say about that.
[49:32.16]Alright, I definitely have not been here, so we're just gonna keep going whatever way we're going here.
[49:36.02]There it is!
[49:37.27]There it is right there, right?
[49:39.17]Is that what I was looking for?
[49:40.09]That's definitely... Yep, that's definitely what I was looking for.
[49:45.99]I don't even know what category you put that in, but that was the worst of something.
[49:48.93]That was the worst something.
[49:50.37]I don't know what, but it was bad.
[49:51.89]It was very bad.
[49:59.43]Do you ever need another move?
[50:01.93]I don't think so.
[50:03.45]This thing almost got voted off the island, too.
[50:09.27]Yep, this is absolutely where I want to be.
[50:13.49]This is exactly what I was looking for.
[50:14.71]Does it need to go down there?
[50:18.25]There's the hand.
[50:19.19]All right.
[50:31.17]I didn't go over there though.
[50:38.90]That was a survivor reference?
[50:45.84]Where did he go?
[50:47.16]9 golden rune.
[50:49.59]Pretty sick.
[50:51.53]So do we celebrate getting to level 100?
[50:53.23]Because that's going to happen in 10-20 minutes.
[50:59.82]guy's ass by the way like that I fired I kicked that that garbillo's ass can we be you see like those perfect dodges we jump over his sword and shit I don't I don't I don't think I saw enough praise for that one I looked over I saw like a couple of pogs but like I didn't see like a wave of them I thought that was quite impressive
[51:26.23]Alright, yeah, I remember.
[51:27.27]No, I sprinted through here too.
[51:29.17]It's such a fucking blur.
[51:30.67]This is the round table hold, right?
[51:32.57]And I sprinted through here and I was like, wow, what is this?
[51:37.15]This is the round table hold.
[51:38.75]And you guys are like, go to bed, go to bed.
[51:40.35]And I was like, no, I don't need to go to bed.
[51:42.01]I'm just going to keep running.
[51:44.55]Yeah, this is the round table hold.
[51:45.57]This is the round table hold.
[51:49.52]So let me explore this a little bit more.
[51:50.84]Rather than just running through it and picking up random items.
[51:57.56]By my sword.
[51:58.30]Are we, like, all dead or something?
[52:04.30]Because this is where the lady sits.
[52:06.50]Are we dead?
[52:07.44]Like, and this is, we've been dead in the real world or something?
[52:11.08]Because this is the round table hold and there's a bunch of dead people here.
[52:23.51]Nobody's alive in here.
[52:25.81]Yeah, fucking what the heck?
[52:37.69]We're gonna find our body.
[52:41.29]Aren't we?
[52:42.91]Our body's gonna be lying on the fucking ground.
[52:45.17]And the music's gonna kick up.
[52:46.15]The violin's gonna kick in hard.
[52:47.65]And there's gonna be a fucking item on me.
[52:55.85]There's gonna be a single rune fragment.
[53:08.81]Okay, so what is actually going on here?
[53:11.37]Why... This has got, like, kind of Hunter's Dream vibes to it.
[53:16.25]Is that the guy?
[53:19.43]It's a different area.
[53:25.58]Yeah, but how... We're gonna find that guy, and he's gonna be like, Oh, Charnished.
[53:33.62]Seems you found the truth.
[53:35.97]See?
[53:36.11]See?
[53:47.61]Seed bed curse.
[53:58.63]I need one more of those.
[54:04.23]First grown on a body defiled by the dung eater.
[54:15.27]tender pox afflicted with omen horns.
[54:18.37]The dung eater cultivates the seedbed curse on corpses.
[54:22.03]By doing so, he prevents dead souls returning to the erd tree, leaving them forever cursed.
[54:28.15]One of the most loathsome things found in all of the lands between.
[54:31.43]I know... I know where that is.
[55:01.65]Whoa!
[55:02.57]Oh no, damn it, come on!
[55:04.24]Alright, so I'm very curious about something.
[55:14.36]I don't want to teleport yet, but let me just look through this fully, completely.
[55:22.55]Yeah, where's the smith usually?
[55:35.32]Anything else here?
[55:39.02]No.
[55:39.60]Not in here.
[55:40.12]Okay.
[55:41.56]He's so high.
[55:42.54]I'm not.
[55:43.26]I'm fine.
[55:44.04]Alright.
[55:49.02]Wait.
[55:49.22]I don't want to miss anything.
[55:52.56]I know I'm walking around.
[55:53.66]Okay.
[55:53.86]This is where the smith usually is.
[55:54.84]Nope.
[56:01.15]Hmm.
[56:02.01]This is not usually open.
[56:08.98]Okay, alright.
[56:11.88]Alright.
[56:13.73]Outside.
[56:14.31]What about the finger lady room?
[56:22.23]Yep.
[56:22.39]You know, there's no rushing through Elden Ring.
[56:24.63]This is like the best game to come out in the last 60 fucking years, okay?
[56:33.70]You understand how sad you're gonna be if you rush through this?
[56:36.91]And then, like, 20 years from now, you're gonna be like, God, I wish I... I wish I'd slowed down.
[56:45.23]I wish I'd slowed down and, you know, enjoyed life more and paid more attention.
[56:54.38]To the southern side of Limgrave.
[56:57.64]I feel like I didn't explore it completely.
[57:01.25]Chat was really on my case about hurrying for the game.
[57:06.06]Oh, Grandpa, it's okay.
[57:07.34]No, it's not.
[57:10.48]This is closed.
[57:11.04]It's not.
[57:13.43]What's in here?
[57:20.31]Alright, that's where the fingers are.
[57:26.08]Let me guess.
[57:31.11]Coded sword?
[57:33.79]What is that?
[57:34.77]And how badly do I want to look at it?
[57:39.71]Faith, fuck!
[57:40.78]Okay, what?
[57:43.24]Oh my god, this is cool.
[57:48.76]It only, it starts at B faith scaling, by the way.
[57:54.52]Nothing else.
[57:56.31]Hidden sword once granted to the tarnished of the round table by the two fingers.
[58:00.94]A formless cipher comprises its blade, which deals holy damage no shield can repel.
[58:08.03]Champions would gather at the Round Table Hoed in days long past when the Two Fingers were masters of oration, their flesh yet full of vigor.
[58:17.78]And it has the Unblockable Blade spell.
[58:22.54]Holy shit.
[58:33.61]Thanks for the bug wing, FromSoftware.
[58:39.31]Faith gets all the cool shit.
[58:49.10]Okay.
[58:49.64]Like, really?
[58:54.46]That's so fucking awesome.
[59:09.28]Bro, int literally gets everything in this game.
[59:11.34]Not the cool stuff.
[59:12.46]It gets everything except the cool things.
[59:20.39]Look at how cool that is.
[59:21.61]That's cooler than the bug wing.
[59:26.21]I know, that's like such a straw man, right?
[59:30.37]Like, oh yeah, we get the bug wing.
[59:32.57]It's like you also get the baby rattle.
[59:34.31]I guarantee you there's people that have like 50 points in faith that saw this item and they went...
[59:41.46]Fucking god damn it.
[59:42.32]Faith sucks.
[59:45.50]You mean to tell me I could have a solar system flail?
[59:48.32]That does a crazy magic damage?
[59:50.68]Man, these int fucking pieces of shit get the best stuff in the game.
[59:58.74]Alright, so I think I got everything.
[59:59.96]That's cool.
[60:00.63]That's an amazing item.
[60:02.27]I wanna... I don't wanna go that way.
[60:04.61]Because I'm scared to go that way.
[60:06.49]I wanna go out where the arm was.
[60:10.17]What does this scale with?
[60:11.03]This scales with int at dex and at strength, but not really.
[60:15.87]Alright.
[60:16.99]Let's go.
[60:17.43]That was cool.
[60:18.43]This is cool.
[60:20.19]Alright, now that I spent the first hour walking around in a circle and just talking, we can actually do some progress here.
[60:25.53]Which, I killed that fucking gargoyle.
[60:26.83]That's progress.
[60:29.21]Alright, let me get out of here.
[60:35.41]Is there a bonfire here somewhere?
[60:37.36]I feel like there probably is.
[60:40.41]I have to go back and I want to talk to that guy down the hall.
[60:47.37]I always get stuck in the round table hold already.
[60:50.39]Alright, you know what?
[60:50.83]I'm just jumping over the balcony.
[60:56.74]I came in here.
[60:57.34]I remember this.
[60:58.32]But did I explore in here?
[60:59.40]I don't think so.
[61:04.70]Not fully.
[61:08.10]Stop yawning.
[61:08.66]There is!
[61:10.33]Alright, thank goodness.
[61:11.89]What?
[61:12.11]I didn't- I already had it?
[61:21.33]Think not of the kindling.
[61:23.85]I shall see to that.
[61:25.53]All I ask of you is to make the journey to the snowy mountaintops of the giants, far above the clouds.
[61:34.05]So you can burn the Erdtreech, honest.
[61:36.03]I'm asking you to commit a cardinal sin, but it must be done to reach the path beyond.
[61:42.57]Do I have to do that, though?
[61:44.71]Is the path I wish to travel.
[61:47.19]Well, you wish to travel that way, but what if I wish to travel a different way?
[61:54.40]I think we might be at ends here.
[61:57.12]Because, like, oh, this is what I want.
[61:58.88]What about what I want?
[62:00.54]How about this?
[62:03.93]Alright.
[62:06.01]I'll burn the Yard Tree.
[62:08.27]But I want you to give me 50 faith.
[62:09.83]Right now.
[62:11.45]Right now.
[62:12.05]Give it to me.
[62:13.31]And we both get what we want.
[62:22.60]Maidenless.
[62:23.43]I'm not maidenless.
[62:24.75]Look!
[62:27.67]Okay, so now I know where I need to go, so let's do this.
[62:32.43]What's this bonfire called?
[62:34.85]Round Table Hold 2 or something?
[62:36.39]Fortified Manor, first floor.
[62:41.23]Let's go see what's going on here, because... I have a feeling...
[62:51.62]He's by the usk people, which is over here.
[63:05.39]Okay.
[63:06.79]This is where that was.
[63:08.07]So let's see what he has to say.
[63:10.79]No.
[63:12.27]Wait.
[63:15.81]You have felt the curse.
[63:17.79]Hawkins smell it on you.
[63:20.54]Pox, yet tender.
[63:23.30]Apparently my seedbed is ripe and waiting.
[63:26.48]T'was a brief respite, I must say.
[63:29.26]Go and unshackle my corporeal flesh, trapped in the sewer jail below the capital.
[63:38.39]I can kill you, and defile your corpse.
[63:42.25]Then the pox will truly be your own.
[63:52.11]What is it, a key?
[63:57.31]What if he kills me?
[63:58.81]I have to be careful, because what if he kills me?
[64:03.12]Does it fuck a bunch of stuff up?
[64:07.52]Unlock sewer jail door said to lie beneath Lendel, the royal capital.
[64:12.57]So that's down in the sewer.
[64:21.36]Okay.
[64:21.54]I'm gonna go kick this guy's ass.
[64:25.80]There's a well under the dragon's wing.
[64:28.84]I'm gonna kick his ass.
[64:35.75]Yeah, we'll see.
[64:39.31]Oh, you talk a lot of shit from behind that fucking computer screen, don't you?
[64:44.23]Sure.
[64:44.67]Oh, you talk a lot of shit.
[64:46.25]I'm about to see you in fucking real life.
[65:01.60]This guy's a literal shit eater?
[65:03.10]Oh, this is the death route.
[65:17.20]Roger.
[65:17.56]Yeah.
[65:17.86]He's a very close friend.
[65:18.82]He's a very close friend.
[65:20.56]This is like one of my best friends.
[65:22.64]Stop.
[65:46.81]like he's half dead already I can't stomach to watch take well the lesson friend yeah that's how you end up when seduced by those who live in death when grace is so huh it rots people from the inside
[66:07.49]I went to his wedding.
[66:08.17]I was in his wedding.
[66:09.43]So... Hey, okay.
[66:11.37]Fuck.
[66:12.29]You got anything else to say?
[66:13.17]I serve the Golden Order.
[66:15.60]That I might put this crooked land to rights.
[66:19.02]Following only the guidance of the Great Elden Ring.
[66:23.08]Those who live in death fall outside the principles of the Golden Order.
[66:27.58]Their mere existence... No, I was in the wedding party!
[66:30.03]I look blown out right now.
[66:31.87]I think the light's too bright.
[66:32.87]Whatever.
[66:33.73]The vermin must be exterminated.
[66:42.96]What the fuck is going on with this guy?
[66:50.01]Is this two people?
[66:58.22]That's his right arm and his left arm is there.
[67:00.74]That's another person's arm.
[67:09.23]Oh, wait, is this one of those costumes that you can get at the party store where it's like, oh, look, I'm riding on a dinosaur, and it's like my legs are the dinosaur's legs?
[67:20.64]And like I'm like inflatable legs are riding the horse or whatever?
[67:24.74]Are you sure?
[67:26.90]This looks like it's two people.
[67:32.22]Wait, why is it going like this?
[67:37.65]If this was just armor, why are you going like this?
[67:39.63]Why are you covering the face of the armor?
[67:44.45]That's his right arm is holding that.
[67:47.23]That's somebody else going like this.
[67:57.57]No, you guys got it all wrong.
[67:58.53]This is two people.
[67:59.81]This is actually two people.
[68:07.28]Does he have four arms?
[68:13.50]Is that arm one?
[68:15.70]That shoulder is the arm.
[68:19.16]Oh wait, is that shoulder fake?
[68:23.60]Is the armor like posed like this?
[68:28.93]So then why is he holding underneath?
[68:31.48]No, you guys got... This is two people.
[68:32.96]I can't... I can't wait till this guy stands up in, like, another 12 hours.
[68:37.15]And he has, like, four fucking blades.
[68:39.85]Like, General Grievous style.
[68:41.79]And the other... The other head starts talking.
[68:44.77]Thank you.
[68:51.22]Alright, so let me... I guess go to the sewer?
[68:54.24]That's interesting.
[68:54.80]Let's do that right now.
[68:57.92]So, underneath the sewer...
[69:02.44]And he's in a cell.
[69:04.26]So apparently this is under the dragon's wing.
[69:29.24]I'm not done exploring yet.
[69:30.16]Hold on.
[69:31.52]See?
[69:32.12]Exactly.
[69:32.54]This is why you can't just... I'm telling you, this is once in a generation am I going to get to walk up those stairs and get that item for the first time.
[69:38.62]Illusion?
[69:58.97]Those NPCs are friendly.
[70:05.35]And you triple jump.
[70:06.33]You cannot.
[70:06.93]You can double jump on the horse.
[70:07.74]I don't know how to get it.
[70:11.68]Fuck.
[70:17.68]Oh, what is it?
[70:18.34]It's just a... It's alright.
[70:19.78]It's not purple or legendary.
[70:23.94]Those guys had dialogue?
[70:26.22]We didn't hear it.
[70:29.30]Alright.
[70:31.88]I'm gonna say the area that I wanted to go was this way, right?
[70:38.65]That way?
[70:39.11]Yes.
[70:40.47]Progress.
[70:45.43]It's fucking cool, man.
[70:47.53]There it is!
[70:47.99]There it is!
[70:48.35]There it is!
[70:48.67]There it is!
[70:49.01]Finally!
[70:49.55]I found it.
[70:50.05]I found it.
[70:50.39]This game's pretty fucking cool.
[70:52.67]Gonna have to do better than that.
[71:08.10]Lightning is, like, one.
[71:09.80]You don't do it when he puts it up.
[71:11.57]It's a second after.
[71:15.27]It's like, boom, dodge.
[71:17.09]Boom, dodge.
[71:30.30]That was 50,000 souls.
[71:31.68]I don't want to lose those.
[71:37.94]And let's also be able to be a magician here.
[71:41.66]Is the guy that beat Dark Souls 3 on stream?
[71:43.66]Actually, replace that with Sekiro because less people did that.
[71:48.14]Right?
[71:48.48]We have to, like, move it up.
[71:50.35]So, less people beat the last boss in Sekiro than beat the last boss in Dark Souls 3.
[71:54.41]We're going to use that from now on.
[71:55.55]You know what?
[72:01.69]Get you first.
[72:12.19]That's going to take a lot longer.
[72:13.23]You know what?
[72:13.55]Come over here.
[72:19.78]Ooh.
[72:27.14]Oh, that hurts a lot.
[72:30.76]Please don't kill me.
[72:31.40]Please don't kill me.
[72:34.14]Don't do lightning.
[72:34.66]Don't do lightning.
[72:35.06]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[72:44.78]Damn it!
[72:52.94]Stop fucking shooting me with a bow and arrow for a second!
[73:01.55]These guys don't get any hit recovery Diablo 2 reference, but you know what I mean?
[73:06.19]They're like... What was that?
[73:27.04]Okay.
[73:36.40]Jeez.
[73:37.18]Ooh.
[74:02.30]That was so loud, and I'm so glad that I have a noise gate, because holy shit.
[74:11.90]Alright, dude, you know what?
[74:13.24]I've got a fucking- I've got a craft of items.
[74:17.00]This is fucking- This is ridiculous, okay?
[74:21.86]I need to craft some items.
[74:26.39]I'm gonna make some of these, I think.
[74:35.37]Alright, some of these scale.
[74:38.44]Anything scale with intelligence?
[74:41.38]Doesn't look like it.
[74:45.56]Arcane.
[74:46.18]Alright, I'm just going to make... I can make 11 of these.
[74:53.88]I'm just going to make 11 fire things.
[74:57.23]I don't... I guess... I'm going to make some of these...
[75:03.65]Sure.
[75:03.89]I'm gonna make this.
[75:09.24]Impede healing.
[75:10.58]Actually, kind of cool.
[75:11.86]That's kind of cool.
[75:13.04]I think for invasions.
[75:17.00]I heard it.
[75:18.94]Didn't hear anything.
[75:21.86]Fire bombs.
[75:24.60]Alleviates blood loss.
[75:25.67]Okay, I'm gonna make some of these.
[75:26.67]Alleviates frost.
[75:28.77]Look, just make shit.
[75:29.71]What's the point of keeping it forever?
[75:32.19]Just make stuff.
[75:34.16]It's the first time I've been this long in the crafting menu in almost 100 hours in the game.
[75:42.72]Okay.
[75:43.78]Alright.
[75:49.18]I think I've made some stuff.
[75:56.80]Okay, so.
[75:58.26]Now, let's go over here.
[76:09.83]No other items here?
[76:12.83]So creepy.
[76:14.81]This is it right here.
[76:15.93]Yeah, it's gonna be right here.
[76:19.72]Why would you build that?
[76:20.68]Alright, what's going on?
[76:27.14]Gravelstone?
[76:30.67]This is not it?
[76:40.16]Oh, wait.
[76:43.41]It's not it, man.
[76:44.85]It's not it, fam.
[76:45.55]Hold on.
[76:47.01]I feel like I can get up there, but wait.
[76:52.33]Can I make that?
[77:08.61]Good.
[77:11.85]Very good.
[77:16.12]So this is not it.
[77:18.24]Is this not as... So it's under the other wing.
[77:20.98]I did want to come check this out, though.
[77:22.34]Anything else I can do?
[77:22.95]I could go up there.
[77:26.63]Next game.
[77:32.46]No.
[77:33.66]I'm an Elden Ring streamer.
[77:42.71]I've solidified my place as Elden Ring content creator.
[77:49.21]Yeah, I'm not a smite streamer anymore.
[77:50.61]I'm an Elden Ring streamer.
[77:51.79]Alright, well this is not it.
[77:56.51]But... I kind of feel like I can get up here.
[78:05.58]Maybe.
[78:05.88]What about over here?
[78:14.37]No, it doesn't look like it.
[78:15.21]Alright, well I'll go the other way.
[78:19.53]What about Mario Golf?
[78:20.69]Yeah, I did play Mario Golf for about... Two or three hours.
[78:24.55]It was fine.
[78:25.50]It was fine.
[78:27.94]It was fine.
[78:28.56]Okay.
[78:31.20]Those of you that want to get like a big hot take from Mr. Germa to tell us about how much he gave Mario Golf a 7.
[78:38.85]It was fine.
[78:39.43]It was fun.
[78:39.99]It was interesting.
[78:40.69]The game was fun.
[78:45.24]I haven't watched you in 10 years.
[78:46.70]Where's the TF2 content?
[78:49.30]Um, there's 10 years worth of it.
[78:52.32]It's on video on demand right now.
[78:55.92]Don't you guys understand that, like, you have the amount of content for every season of Seinfeld and every season of Friends and every season of Game of Thrones as Team Fortress 2 video content?
[79:10.37]Just go to my Netflix fucking page, whatever.
[79:13.07]Go to my YouTube page.
[79:16.14]There's like 700 days of TF2 videos.
[79:24.28]It's probably way less than that, but you understand.
[79:28.78]Okay, so let me go this way now.
[79:36.77]No, I'm not... Don't get me in trouble.
[79:38.87]I just said it's like a Netflix-esque platform of YouTube content video on demand.
[79:44.59]Alright, I'm going that way.
[79:48.30]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[79:48.84]I'm going this way.
[79:50.70]This is new.
[79:56.88]Oh, fuck.
[80:00.54]Oh, yeah!
[80:07.85]Oh, shit.
[80:08.33]That's two.
[80:12.01]Fuck, your timings.
[80:43.02]Where the f- Fucking what?
[80:56.33]Where can you even fall there?
[80:58.13]That's... I don't even understand where you fall there.
[81:05.69]Oh, goddammit.
[81:06.85]Am I seriously here?
[81:08.16]Whatever.
[81:10.54]Wait, you just... Yeah, but... I don't get it.
[81:13.58]I need to look at that.
[81:19.16]Is the baseball stream definitely happening in March?
[81:21.21]No.
[81:21.31]No.
[81:27.49]The baseball stream, I can tell you right now, is 100% confirmed to be the next stream that is like an event stream.
[81:39.37]Which, I mean, I really wanted it to be in March.
[81:44.28]But it's a lot of moving parts and trying to get all those moving parts to work.
[81:51.26]It's a lot of people to have to get together.
[81:56.78]Uh, but I will stop at nothing for that stream to happen over the next few months.
[82:06.45]Okay, let's get this guy.
[82:07.79]So where did I fall down?
[82:08.81]I didn't even know this.
[82:12.19]Okay, I like knew this.
[82:13.87]I thought there was a railing.
[82:16.63]Where did I even fall?
[82:17.97]I thought, okay, that was weird.
[82:19.69]I thought this was like a railing.
[82:20.89]I almost did it again.
[82:34.45]Oh dude, fucking dungeon down here.
[82:36.01]Oh yeah, there's a fucking dungeon down here.
[82:48.89]Is this safe?
[82:54.68]Oh yeah, absolutely.
[82:56.16]Absolutely, there's definitely something down here.
[83:08.10]Wish I could get on the horse.
[83:16.86]I saw an item and I freaked out and I was like, I need to go get it.
[83:32.33]Alright, so where's this go?
[83:39.67]Nice.
[83:40.05]Actually, I really need these.
[83:44.91]Oh, shit.
[83:45.45]What's over there?
[83:45.87]Alright, I need to... I want to just keep that marked.
[83:54.43]Because there's somebody lying down over there.
[83:56.13]There's an invisible bridge.
[84:02.42]If this is a lie, I'm turning my stream off.
[84:09.77]Did I?
[84:10.93]Confirm it, otherwise it's going off.
[84:15.62]Okay.
[84:21.08]Alright, well, I can't go that way.
[84:22.56]That was cool.
[84:23.20]I just like this.
[84:24.18]Alright, let's go back up.
[84:27.92]I want to go into this Coliseum.
[84:31.18]There are no invisible bridges.
[84:32.62]FromSoftware did it once, and everybody thought it was the worst thing they've ever made.
[84:36.42]So they were like, we should probably not do that again.
[84:43.42]Wrong way.
[84:45.40]Actually, no, this is the right way.
[84:54.22]I remember playing that area in Dark Souls 3.
[84:55.97]Or was it Dark Souls 2?
[84:57.97]I remember.
[84:58.59]It's like the weird crystal area.
[85:01.19]And I did say out loud, this is the worst thing that they've ever made.
[85:04.21]Didn't I?
[85:04.51]Fuck, I say that all the time, though.
[85:08.11]Does that not hold any more weight at all?
[85:11.14]Because I keep saying that.
[85:17.76]This just holds no weight.
[85:20.20]This is the worst thing I think that they've made.
[85:21.52]All right.
[85:22.78]Well, you've said that like 15 times.
[85:25.35]Do you even like this game?
[85:27.47]Do you even like these fucking games?
[85:30.49]This is probably the worst fucking area they've ever made.
[85:32.13]This is the worst boss I think they've ever made.
[85:36.09]Jeremy, there are only two other areas that are in the game.
[85:39.91]Yeah, whatever.
[85:43.59]Talking in third person.
[85:44.47]He's a fucking ego weirdo.
[85:48.63]Alright, pay attention.
[85:50.57]Eat shit!
[86:10.90]It's so good when you get it.
[86:20.37]That was a little cocky, I'll agree.
[86:28.26]Ooh, what do you got?
[86:31.68]Duelist Helm!
[86:32.63]A Duelist Helm!
[86:37.95]What is that?
[86:41.46]Bronze helm decorated with innumerable snakes.
[86:45.38]Worn by gladiators who were driven from the Colosseum.
[86:48.16]The wearer becomes a slightly easier target for foes.
[86:52.84]What?
[86:53.88]You have a bigger hitbox with this on?
[86:58.97]The snake is viewed as a traitor to the Erdtree.
[87:01.75]And the audience delighted in seeing these bronze effigies beaten and battered.
[87:08.97]Snake.
[87:10.49]Tree.
[87:15.15]Is there an apple in this game?
[87:16.03]Are there apples?
[87:24.57]Put it on.
[87:27.13]I mean, I look like a weirdo.
[87:28.35]I don't want to have a bigger hitbox.
[87:40.70]Chris's mind.
[87:41.58]Ooh!
[87:43.78]What am I wearing right now?
[87:45.02]It has... Okay, it's two intellect.
[87:48.62]Do I give a shit about intellect still?
[87:51.25]Because I have so much of it.
[87:52.05]I have like 60 something.
[87:57.43]Does armor even do anything in the game?
[88:00.52]You know, it's funny.
[88:01.12]I've played every single FromSoftware game essentially since like 2010, whatever.
[88:06.31]I still don't know what armor does.
[88:09.81]I just know it has blue numbers and red numbers.
[88:12.51]And the blue number is better, I guess.
[88:16.29]I still don't even know what it does.
[88:19.42]It's just one number is 12 and the other number is like 8.
[88:22.84]So, I guess that reduces it by 8%.
[88:31.59]Is that 5.8% physical damage negation?
[88:40.47]No.
[88:41.31]Do you understand how I don't get it then?
[88:45.55]5.8.
[88:52.29]Those numbers on the right are even more confusing.
[88:58.50]Anyways, let's go.
[89:11.62]Nobody else is here, right?
[89:12.62]It's just this guy.
[89:13.36]Alright, let's go.
[89:13.96]Ready?
[89:20.06]Oh, that day definitely made that better.
[89:22.45]Without a doubt.
[89:33.46]Oh, fuck.
[89:33.86]He got me.
[89:39.83]Oh shit.
[89:41.07]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[89:43.71]I got this in the bag.
[89:44.75]Just fucking don't do an idiot move.
[89:53.70]Choke slam off the top rope.
[89:55.40]Battle hammer.
[89:56.48]Alright, cool.
[89:57.84]Do I even need to look at it?
[89:58.69]Because I'm not going to use it.
[90:05.13]Gladiatorial combat used by duelists who were exiled from the Colosseum.
[90:09.26]Why are they all getting kicked out of the Colosseum?
[90:14.68]These guys have all been booted from the Colosseum.
[90:16.30]What did you do?
[90:18.18]Why?
[90:23.79]They drank.
[90:24.37]They chugged mid-duel.
[90:28.93]Ritual shield talisman.
[90:34.61]they got kicked out of like the pvp raises defense when hp is at maximum okay I feel like that's kind of hard to do though in this game being at 100 hp especially in a boss fight or in mid fight is really hard to be there maximum right like see you're always kind of hanging out around here
[91:02.09]That helps reduce a one-shot kill.
[91:04.42]Yeah, we have to be at full max health.
[91:06.04]Alright, cool.
[91:13.27]So, I'm imagining there's something scary in there.
[91:15.53]Is there a bonfire I can get or something?
[91:20.87]There's gotta be, like, a bonfire right here, right?
[91:32.24]I'm going there.
[91:32.72]Seems wild.
[91:44.83]Dude.
[91:45.83]Can I?
[91:46.21]No, I definitely go.
[91:47.07]I thought I could make that jump.
[91:50.03]No, you cannot.
[91:53.17]Wild.
[91:53.80]That's crazy.
[91:54.68]Nuts.
[91:57.00]That reminds me of like...
[91:59.25]When a game company puts like a YouTuber or like a streamer's quote on their like Steam store page or something.
[92:06.99]Jerma985 says, wild.
[92:09.14]Oh, craziest game.
[92:11.48]Okay.
[92:22.01]Dude, that was intense.
[92:23.29]That doesn't mean, that didn't say the game was good.
[92:28.22]Jerma985 says, that encounter was intense.
[92:32.32]He later went on to give the game a 3 out of 10.
[92:34.92]They don't say that part.
[92:44.91]Ooh, what's going on here?
[92:51.73]This is free fucking free soul, baby.
[93:01.74]I'm so sad.
[93:06.56]I took his shoes.
[93:07.64]That's like so fucked up.
[93:09.97]That's so fucked up.
[93:11.29]Look at the gear I have right now.
[93:14.03]Okay, my outfit is probably worth like fifty to sixty thousand dollars and like I'm gonna take this guy's shoes is like just Regular like Skechers or something.
[93:24.25]What like what do I need this?
[93:27.99]I?
[93:28.07]Have like a hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of stuff on me right now Why would I need to take that guy's just sneakers?
[93:35.50]Why would I need to take his like little loafers?
[93:37.24]That's so that's so awful.
[93:38.58]I
[93:43.17]Yeah, I might need these later.
[93:51.77]What the fuck is that?
[93:52.75]There's tons of items up here.
[93:55.88]Star fist?
[93:59.52]Oh, I got one of these too.
[94:00.78]Is this what I got?
[94:05.81]Oh, it's a faith thing.
[94:07.01]Okay.
[94:10.96]Oh, this is bloodlust.
[94:11.77]Yeah, it's spiked hands.
[94:17.29]I gotta see these.
[94:21.85]I'm like an undersea creature.
[94:29.82]That's cool.
[94:37.42]Alright, those are actually really cool.
[94:39.20]Strength.
[94:40.16]Really?
[94:40.36]I would think it would be... Well, I guess it makes sense.
[94:47.17]So many fucking items.
[94:50.67]Okay.
[94:51.61]That's cool.
[94:55.89]You can be Meta Knight.
[94:56.89]You can become Knuckles.
[95:01.53]Alright, it's time to fight whatever's in here.
[95:03.20]There's absolutely somebody in here.
[95:06.68]There's no way you have a huge coliseum.
[95:09.07]But there's no bonfire, which I'm concerned about.
[95:13.83]And then we'll go into the dragon and we'll go into the sewer.
[95:22.85]No bonfire?
[95:23.65]Is there a statue at least?
[95:26.44]I don't think so.
[95:31.62]Maybe there's a statue.
[95:40.80]I guess I could come down from there, right?
[95:44.80]Wait.
[95:47.58]Hold that thought.
[95:48.12]Can I go up there?
[95:54.42]Lindell is so... I am just so overwhelmed.
[95:57.34]Like, I keep seeing other... I keep getting halfway to my destination and stopping and going the other way.
[96:03.89]This is... Okay, this is... Okay, that's the sanctuary.
[96:05.97]So I can come out there and go this way.
[96:08.81]All right.
[96:13.29]Let's open this door.
[96:20.84]ADHD.
[96:23.14]But, I mean, to be honest, this is like one of the most... There's so many ways to go.
[96:29.02]You could just walk in a direction and then there's like five ways to go.
[96:31.94]And you might go one direction and then give up halfway through because you see something more interesting that's a mile behind you.
[96:41.05]And then you don't ever get anything done.
[96:43.72]It's remarkable that I've gotten here so far.
[96:46.34]Because I just, I'll always go halfway, and then something else gets my attention, and I just go the other way.
[96:50.74]Alright.
[96:54.70]Here we go.
[96:57.45]Oh god, really?
[97:04.47]Where were we going?
[97:05.57]We were going underneath the wing, right, of the dragon.
[97:07.79]Okay, let's go.
[97:14.83]I want to go over there.
[97:18.53]Shit.
[97:18.99]I want to go over there so bad.
[97:20.19]Alright.
[97:23.36]We're going to the wing.
[97:24.14]Let me check and see if there's anything else I didn't get here.
[97:31.62]So I should probably just go like this.
[97:34.56]Right?
[97:34.72]Because if I need to go to the wing... Then it's under here.
[97:50.54]Because the wing would be out this way, right?
[97:56.84]Did you see the wall you have to hit like 35 times?
[97:59.06]Yeah, I heard about it.
[98:00.83]I think that's a bug.
[98:01.63]I don't think that's actually supposed to be in the video game.
[98:06.87]Alright.
[98:08.01]That's where I need to go, right?
[98:15.40]I'm really far away from this fucking thing.
[98:21.43]That's a bug.
[98:23.19]So, I'm way too far away.
[98:24.61]I need to go, like, over here.
[98:28.33]Yeah, I'll go closer.
[98:36.86]If I have to go under the wing, then I need to go way further in here.
[98:39.84]Alright, here we go.
[98:44.16]I gotta go... there.
[98:48.44]Under which wing?
[98:49.30]Under the big wing there?
[98:54.94]Take over there.
[98:55.44]Under here.
[98:57.26]Alright, let's go.
[99:06.51]Wasn't I already over here?
[99:12.10]I was already over here.
[99:22.91]Is it right here?
[99:38.13]Oh, it's right here.
[99:39.19]Alright.
[99:42.85]Okay, let's do it.
[99:44.85]I found it!
[99:57.63]Rune arc?
[100:03.17]Oh, fuck.
[100:03.57]I don't want to open this.
[100:06.69]This is the... I gotta use the key here.
[100:09.29]Is there something to... I... But what if I get killed?
[100:19.24]What if he kills me?
[100:19.94]He said he was gonna... He said he was gonna, like, do weird... He was gonna do something horrible to me.
[100:41.02]There's definitely a bonfire down here.
[100:42.12]Hopefully that's not... I fucking need... Starlight!
[101:10.37]Or just buy the lantern.
[101:11.57]It's like a hundred runes.
[101:17.26]Oh my god, I need it.
[101:19.44]I didn't- I never bought the lantern.
[101:20.56]I didn't buy the binoculars either.
[101:21.84]Okay, I gotta come back.
[101:23.78]I gotta buy a fucking lantern.
[101:28.55]Do I have a torch?
[101:29.25]Dude, how do I not even have the torch?
[101:37.73]How do I not have any of these items?
[101:50.23]There'll be a bonfire down here, right?
[101:51.53]And I can just put on starlight.
[101:59.81]Oh fuck, I don't want to open that.

[105:35.00]What'd I say?
[105:41.49]I didn't even say anything.
[105:42.21]I didn't do anything.
[105:50.65]Oh, I've never been so relieved.
[105:58.12]Okay, I can level up.
[106:06.38]Do I get endurance to 20?
[106:07.54]Is it level 100?
[106:16.19]You had dead air?
[106:18.09]I am dodging for my life here, okay?
[106:20.87]I'm sorry that I'm not, like, I-frame, I-frame, I-frame.
[106:24.53]Dodge, attack, dodge.
[106:26.13]Sorry, I went to Dunkin' Donuts today.
[106:27.21]No, I'm fucking concentrating.
[106:28.91]I can't just, like, tell you about a Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru story.
[106:32.25]Not when I'm doing that.
[106:38.65]Alright, I need... Okay, so let me tell you.
[106:42.52]I was on an airplane recently.
[106:43.86]I can't speak when I play these games.
[106:48.92]I'm doing endurance.
[106:49.66]I feel like it's going to really bite me in the ass if I don't.
[106:54.93]Now, let's take one second.
[106:57.61]Okay, this is... Thank God.
[106:59.81]Underground roadside.
[107:00.97]This motherfucker has the lantern in the first ten minutes of the game, right?
[107:22.01]No, just buy the binoculars too.
[107:23.53]Who cares?
[107:23.99]I don't have any of this stuff.
[107:26.67]Goodbye.
[107:28.84]Who has it?
[107:29.82]It's in Lunera.
[107:30.90]Okay.
[107:39.28]Alright, talk to that guy.
[107:40.22]Alright, wait.
[107:40.65]Where is it?
[107:46.03]I'm so glad they put the NPCs on the map.
[107:51.19]You don't have him on your map.
[107:56.79]You know what?
[107:57.35]Fucking don't care.
[107:58.13]Alright, um, whatever.
[107:59.69]I don't care.
[108:01.35]I don't care.
[108:01.71]Here's what we're gonna do.
[108:03.03]I'm gonna use my spells because I'm a fucking wizard.
[108:05.78]Okay?
[108:07.86]I haven't used... Okay, I treat spells in this game the same way that I treat apps on my iPad.
[108:15.38]If I haven't opened them in over two weeks, I delete them.
[108:19.89]It doesn't matter what was on them.
[108:21.67]So, I have not used Eternal Darkness in two in-game days.
[108:26.51]Two in-game weeks.
[108:28.37]It's getting deleted.
[108:29.09]I'm obviously not going to use it ever again.
[108:31.73]So, where's Starlight?
[108:38.26]Buy a torch, you one-percenter.
[108:47.33]What do you mean?
[108:47.77]Why are you saying that?
[108:50.07]Why are you saying that?
[108:53.01]Why are you calling me a one percenter?
[108:58.58]Do you mean like I have a lot of runes?
[109:01.22]What do you mean?
[109:03.02]It's not... Okay, let's go.
[109:06.46]I... So much shit that I don't even have explored.
[109:11.48]This game is fucking crazy.
[109:16.09]I don't believe this game is real.
[109:18.61]It's like so much.
[109:25.52]Buy a torch.
[109:26.28]I have starlight.
[109:33.28]Huh?
[109:35.58]Starlight's better than a torch.
[109:36.74]It fills the whole room.
[109:37.68]It's better than the torch.
[109:42.66]I mean, I do get, like, kind of pool eyes.
[109:45.22]Like, chlorine eyes, but whatever.
[109:46.86]Is there anything else in this room?
[110:01.76]Alright.
[110:03.16]Get him.
[110:03.72]Wait.
[110:07.04]Okay, let's go.
[110:13.75]He didn't like that.
[110:18.29]Oh, you are not even match for me.
[110:42.80]Oh, my God.
[110:43.80]Oh, I am unstoppable.
[110:59.30]Could be the best weapon art in the game.
[111:01.88]I never would have thought it was Moonville.
[111:07.44]Nope.
[111:08.00]And everyone... Oh, wow.
[111:09.45]So, I watched Blood Soaked Mask.
[111:12.11]Jesus.
[111:13.69]I watched this guy trip on 985, and he, uh, he, he, the Bastard Stars turned out to be, like, one of the better items, especially in PvP.
[111:20.61]You know, I didn't think that they were gonna be that good.
[111:23.67]Turns out, that's a lot of runes.
[111:38.83]What an ego.
[111:43.80]There's a lot of those guys.
[111:45.00]There's like two in that room.
[111:46.06]Alright, so I can go down, but let me see.
[111:47.50]There's another room I can go in, right?
[111:50.54]I'm not quite ready to go down.
[111:54.01]Maybe I am.
[111:57.87]I'll go this way.
[111:59.95]I'm going to go this way.
[112:01.69]Why not?
[112:02.85]Remind me that that exists up there.
[112:07.23]Because I'll forget.
[112:10.90]The boy's on call.
[112:12.22]Yeah, there.
[112:14.30]Did just upgrade them.
[112:22.61]Freezing grease.
[112:27.99]God fucking dammit.
[112:39.18]Thankfully it's not far.
[112:48.88]I did not think it went down that far.
[112:51.81]That goes down in eternity.
[112:53.81]I thought it was maybe 50 feet, maybe tops.
[113:06.56]Okay, so... I thought it was... Yeah, whatever.
[113:10.38]Okay.
[113:27.43]I hear the sprinkles.
[113:28.51]I hear sprinkles, and I want it.
[113:32.16]Oh, hi there.
[113:35.82]Blank him.
[113:40.78]Hey, buffed Comet.
[113:41.62]Comet is so much better.
[113:45.44]Comet is a million times better.
[113:47.51]I would say a hundred million.
[113:49.83]Before, you could only cast it like once or twice.
[113:52.17]You can cast it like four times now.
[113:58.15]Yeah, maybe I need more mine, but you know.
[114:06.14]Where is the sprinkles?
[114:07.06]I hear it.
[114:08.16]Probably below me.
[114:16.92]Get the fuck out of here.
[114:26.46]Red.
[114:27.86]RED!
[114:30.86]This baby rattle does not seem safe for children.
[114:41.69]It's because it's an adult baby rattle.
[114:44.68]It's an adult rattle.
[115:00.56]Why do I have such low mana?
[115:02.82]Because I didn't put many points into mind.
[115:04.48]Because casting was not supposed to be number one for me.
[115:08.96]Now, a lot of people have been very upset with me because I haven't been using my spells that frequently.
[115:15.00]And let me tell you.
[115:16.61]First of all, fuck up.
[115:19.25]Second of all, C1.
[115:21.79]And number three, I wanted to make a character that scaled on intelligence with weapons.
[115:29.43]Fuck up.
[115:40.39]Oh, that was based.
[115:46.82]Because I want a two-handed intelligence weapon.
[115:50.80]I wanted a two-handed intelligence weapon.
[115:53.18]Fucked up.
[115:56.40]Alright, pay attention because I just forgot where I was.
[115:59.48]Wait.
[116:00.88]This is what I'm talking about.
[116:03.41]I can go like three different directions.
[116:07.85]I don't know which one, I don't know which one to do.
[116:10.29]There's so many places to go.
[116:11.79]I feel like I'm in like the McDonald's play place.
[116:16.73]It's just like, do I go down the slide?
[116:18.31]Do I go in the ball pit?
[116:19.25]Do I go and climb through the tunnels up there?
[116:21.61]There's too many choices.
[116:22.82]The McDonald's play pit is the Dark Souls of like kids entertainment, by the way.
[116:29.46]There's shortcuts?
[116:36.58]Don't you guys want to see... Don't you guys want to see Miyazaki make a fucking McDonald's play place?
[116:42.99]God, that would be so cool.
[116:44.15]Can you imagine how crazy that would be?
[116:51.99]I'm telling you, there's a cross promotion there somewhere.
[116:54.24]I think that it's... It could be huge.
[117:02.08]I couldn't get out of this area without a guide.
[117:03.80]Wait, you physically didn't know how to leave?
[117:05.74]Like, you...
[117:07.40]Can you not teleport out?
[117:08.62]Oh.
[117:11.16]Oh, I thought you meant, like, you physically couldn't physically leave.
[117:14.00]Like, you didn't know where to go.
[117:15.42]And you couldn't teleport.
[117:18.00]That's funny.
[117:18.86]If that actually happens.
[117:21.47]Alright, pay attention.
[117:24.17]Um... I came from this way.
[117:28.67]Did I... So you can hear, like... You can hear...
[117:38.51]Fucking kids are just going through these tubes.
[117:44.57]You're just gonna hear, like... Ow!
[117:49.24]Stop!
[117:54.56]Did you hear, like, a slide down here?
[118:03.21]Alright, stop getting overwhelmed and stop being weird.
[118:06.27]Let's go.
[118:07.63]I'm gonna go this way.
[118:08.43]I've chosen to go this way.
[118:11.81]This is the entrance.
[118:13.45]Turn around and go the other way.
[118:17.62]There we go.
[118:18.06]This is the way.
[118:18.66]I'm gonna go this way.
[118:26.12]I'm gonna go over here.
[118:29.20]And I'm gonna head this way.
[118:34.30]And I'm gonna jump down onto this pipe.
[118:36.86]That's what I've decided.
[118:37.82]That's what I've chosen.
[118:38.56]Fucking lobsters down here.
[118:53.41]Oh, that hurt!
[118:53.97]Did I do that wrong?
[119:07.19]Oh, sick!
[119:09.69]You see?
[119:10.10]He would be unnatural at making a play place.
[119:24.48]Or a dog park.
[119:40.25]Oh, shit.
[119:40.79]That's bad.
[119:41.29]What are they doing?
[119:53.30]Run.
[119:57.08]Run.
[119:57.36]My eyeball is itching.
[120:13.80]He's like stuck in his ass.
[120:18.51]Oh, what the fuck did he just spit at me?
[120:21.39]What was that?
[120:22.51]What?
[120:30.89]What the fuck?
[120:36.76]Oh my god.
[120:37.54]I can't even fucking react to it.
[120:45.52]Kill me.
[120:47.47]Stop being so confident, but this is how this has to work.
[121:01.08]Oh my god, just... Fuck you!
[121:14.63]Oh, my friend over there needs to... I don't... Smithing... Just a smithing stump.
[121:25.60]Don't!
[121:26.12]Oh, I'm dead.
[121:27.01]Alright, I got the... I got the smithing stump.
[121:30.97]These guys have a ton of health.
[121:47.28]He died to Lobster's Omega Lull.
[121:52.64]Dead.
[121:58.00]Just don't do any damage, actually.
[122:01.80]What?
[122:02.31]I mean, I got a plus 9 Bastard Stars, man.
[122:05.39]And I got, like, 57 Intelligence.
[122:09.37]I'm doing damage.
[122:10.11]This is just... These guys are hard.
[122:11.15]This is a hard area.
[122:13.57]This is an area that is very, very tricky.
[122:17.19]It's late game.
[122:18.76]Well, mid to late game.
[122:19.72]You know, later game.
[122:22.46]I'm not fighting.
[122:22.92]These guys are just going to fall off and die.
[122:24.22]See who cares.
[122:26.32]Oh, that's bad.
[122:34.77]Okay, right there.
[122:35.51]That's a quick way to do it.
[122:36.51]Don't miss.
[122:38.61]Alright, I'm good.
[122:39.37]He'll die if he lands here.
[122:43.11]Alright, we're good.
[122:44.84]So, where are my souls?
[122:46.78]Wasn't really that many, but you know.
[122:47.88]Alright, I'm just gonna get items and run.
[123:01.64]Really?
[123:01.92]You're gonna... That was bullshit.
[123:04.17]You waited till I... Why are lobsters the hardest enemy in the game?
[123:18.00]That's a lot.
[123:18.64]I got to get all these.
[123:19.46]This is smithing stone seven.
[123:23.97]No way I don't get all these.
[123:25.45]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[123:33.93]Come over here.

[123:52.69]I couldn't do anything!
[123:53.79]I couldn't- I couldn't move!
[123:55.27]I didn't have- I couldn't move!
[123:57.65]What the fuck?
[123:59.19]I want that, whatever it is.
[124:00.39]I actually couldn't move.
[124:03.82]No roll, no.
[124:04.62]I was- I was- the animation wasn't done.
[124:20.87]I don't need- I don't have to climb without that.
[124:22.65]Just fall.
[124:32.08]Alright.
[124:32.44]So... Whatever it is, get it and then I gotta figure out where I am.
[124:37.16]Okay, there's one more.
[124:47.32]Get the fuck away from me!
[124:52.62]He's right behind me.
[124:55.28]Mog's shackle?
[124:59.26]Oh, I can go that way.
[125:02.57]Mog's shackle.
[125:11.41]You can't get in here, right?
[125:14.51]Oh, shit.
[125:15.00]Bonfire.
[125:18.46]Nice.
[125:19.34]Hell yeah.
[125:22.86]Okay, so what did I... He's got something.
[125:26.08]Mog's shackle.
[125:29.61]It was a key.
[125:34.67]Was it a key?
[125:40.84]It wasn't a key?
[125:41.60]Was it a talisman?
[125:44.56]It wasn't a weapon, was it?
[125:56.73]Where is it?
[126:00.38]Am I just stupid and just passed over it?
[126:06.47]There it is.
[126:08.35]Mog check.
[126:08.91]Briefly binds Mog once imprisoned to earth.
[126:16.58]fetish bathes in golden magic shackles were used to bind the accursed people called the omen and these ones were made to keep a particular omen under strictest confinement though faint the shackle still retained vestiges of power enough to trap the once bound mog on earth if only for a short time finds mog wait if I just use this what happens
[126:43.77]Do I- Do I like converse with Mog?
[126:45.75]If I- Can I- Do- Do I- Do I spawn Mog?
[126:51.40]Right here?
[126:51.94]If I use it right here?
[126:53.00]Alright, I gotta go up this way.
[127:03.89]You use it when you fight Mog.
[127:07.43]Who the fuck is Mog?
[127:11.50]Am I supposed to know who that is?
[127:12.48]WAIT!
[127:13.88]I'll get it.
[127:14.42]WAIT!

[128:04.63]You've killed Mog twice.
[128:06.57]What are you talking about?
[128:07.82]I didn't kill anybody.
[128:10.52]Who's Mog?
[128:13.34]I have not killed Mog.

[128:56.85]I've killed like three versions of the other guy.
[129:02.16]I have no idea.
[129:03.92]You haven't killed Mog.

[129:34.16]I tried.
[129:34.60]I tried to dodge it.
[129:35.23]I didn't do it.
[129:35.61]I'm gonna die.
[129:36.93]Relax.

[130:41.19]Aye, me lord.
[130:54.14]Later.
[131:01.20]Wait, I've already... I've already been here.
[131:09.09]Haven't I been over... I already did this.
[131:10.89]Uh... Yeah, I did this already.
[131:24.76]This just goes back up.
[131:27.78]So then I have to go from here.
[131:29.91]Instead of going this way, I go... Yeah, because that's where the elevator is.
[131:33.19]So I can keep going down.
[131:34.07]Okay.
[131:36.55]Okay.
[131:38.89]Didn't I pull the lever?
[131:41.77]Walk by some- I pulled the lever, didn't I?
[131:43.27]I thought I pulled it.
[131:49.53]No?
[131:50.33]What the fuck did I pull then?
[131:52.01]Wrong lever.
[131:53.44]What?
[132:10.15]You guys have a fucking million health.
[132:15.85]Ugh.
[132:18.71]That was a backstab and you all know it.
[132:37.81]Don't get poisoned.
[132:43.08]Alright.
[132:45.30]There was another contraption to pull?
[133:01.73]I knew you were right there.
[133:11.56]Thought I was going over there, didn't you?
[133:15.88]Oh shit, I'm dead.
[133:21.14]I feel like I need to end the flask thing.
[133:23.98]You know what I mean?
[133:24.98]End the sacred tear.
[133:25.72]I feel like I'm not healing as much as I should be.
[133:38.73]1200 damage.
[133:43.30]Ghost glove ward.
[133:44.16]Nice.
[133:46.94]Very nice.
[133:53.40]Always check the ceilings.
[133:54.22]You want a tip for FromSoftware games?
[133:55.78]Every time you go in a corridor, just go like this.
[134:05.10]How did you not kill the other guy?
[134:07.50]Whoa!
[134:18.39]I didn't even get fucking scared.
[134:24.19]I'm not going.
[134:40.28]Let me go over here first.
[134:46.72]He's still in the toilet.
[134:47.68]It'd be weird if I was, wouldn't it?
[134:53.15]Okay, I know I can do this, right?
[134:54.43]Yeah.
[134:58.67]Bring me up.
[135:01.49]Bring me up.
[135:01.93]I want to go up here.
[135:04.89]Bring me up!
[135:05.43]Okay.
[135:13.94]Alright, I think it's just one of these things.
[135:15.64]Okay.
[135:24.95]Oh shit.
[135:26.35]It's Mog.
[135:37.56]That was really dumb.
[135:49.98]Fuck you.
[135:50.46]Let me get it off.
[136:03.86]Get out of here!
[136:40.48]Fucking Mog down.
[136:42.76]Mog down.
[136:46.24]That guy's kind of crazy.
[136:49.43]That's Moggedown.
[136:51.58]Crucible Scale Talisman.
[136:53.20]Holy shit, what is this?
[137:02.02]Raises damage taken from critical hits.
[137:04.87]What?
[137:07.23]Talisman fashioned from a scale that embodies the aspects of various creatures.
[137:11.29]Said to have grown on the human body long ago.
[137:13.41]It's a heart.
[137:15.69]Reduces damage taken from critical hits.
[137:22.30]That's kind of cool.
[137:23.68]Good for PvP, yeah.
[137:28.12]What level are you?
[137:29.54]I'm level 100.
[137:30.30]Exactly.
[137:33.69]You guys talked all this shit about Mog.
[137:34.97]That was not even a problem.
[137:39.97]That's kind of cool.
[137:41.17]It's bad in PvP as well.
[137:52.83]Alright, so now we're gonna keep heading this way.
[137:56.73]That was pretty practical, dude.
[137:58.08]Alright, up here.
[138:07.56]That guy was harder than... Well, actually, that's not true considering I just beat him with the first try.
[138:13.09]That was a really interesting moveset.
[138:17.11]What do you got?
[138:23.92]Didn't think I was in reach.
[138:25.70]Holy shit, man.
[138:26.74]Oh my god.
[138:30.80]Oh my goodness.
[138:31.90]I got two cocky fighting fucking mag.
[138:46.38]What?
[138:48.42]You're on the fucking stairs, bullshit.
[138:56.31]I got plenty of mana, fucking cast it!
[139:08.09]Oh shit!
[139:12.46]Why didn't I cast it the first time?
[139:14.08]How come I didn't cast it the first time?
[139:21.82]I had mana.
[139:26.73]Oh, now I'm all the way over here.
[139:27.77]Whatever.
[139:28.05]I don't have to go fight that other guy.
[139:32.03]Dog shit.
[139:32.95]That was what we like to call in the industry.
[139:35.71]Dog shit.
[139:43.33]I just got mugged.
[139:51.22]No, what happened was...
[139:53.45]That guy, I had an intense battle with his brother or his other teammate.
[139:58.87]He was way stronger than him in every way.
[140:02.42]And then he got the last hit on me.
[140:04.04]Because we happened to have to fight again.
[140:06.46]This guy did not beat me, let's be really honest.
[140:12.23]That's like if I sit there and try to open the jar that's really tight over and over again, and I'm using all my strength, and then you open it and look and see how strong you are.
[140:19.58]No, I did that.
[140:20.70]You just came in and kill-stole my fucking jar.
[140:22.76]That's what happened.
[140:26.73]Why can I not fucking fight this guy?
[140:28.93]Of all the... I fought like 10 of them so far.
[140:53.08]You how do you stay and not get staggered by that Wait
[141:14.41]Fuck you!
[141:15.01]You don't even- That's- Why am I so tilted fighting this guy?
[141:19.24]I've killed 10 of your fucking siblings by now!
[141:21.98]With no problem at all!
[141:24.54]This guy's fucking driving me crazy!
[141:27.08]I've killed like 10 of this person's siblings!
[141:30.12]Without an issue!
[141:31.39]And I'm just getting hit by every fucking one of his goddamn moves!
[141:43.80]What?
[141:44.78]Oh shit, I had the physics thing on.
[141:50.43]Dude, I beat Magic Mog first try and get hit twice.
[141:55.15]Regular ass Mog comes at me and fucking kills me over and over and over again.
[142:04.82]I'm too confident fighting regular Mog.
[142:07.02]I got too much confidence.
[142:09.64]Because Magic Mog was fucking decimated and it was very tough.
[142:14.89]Jesus Christ.
[142:16.59]Come on, man.
[142:19.15]Here we go.
[143:02.63]Why is it not staggering?
[143:03.87]It staggers everybody else.
[143:10.11]My god, you regular ass Mog.
[143:12.25]I swear to god if you kill me again.
[143:18.98]Don't fucking die to regular ass mom!
[143:20.80]Okay, we're good.
[143:27.02]Ooh.
[143:30.54]Omen cleaver?
[143:36.92]It's just strength?
[143:37.98]Like a quality weapon?
[143:41.36]Heavy bladed curved sword of colossal size awarded to Omen as a tool of war.
[143:45.64]This weapon is made to take advantage of brute strength
[143:50.54]It's D scaling with strength, and it requires 19 to put it on.
[143:54.35]That's not brute strength to me.
[143:57.85]Okay.
[144:01.61]Kind of cool, I guess.
[144:06.20]It's cool.
[144:08.68]Oh, that... That swinging pattern is actually really good.
[144:18.27]I don't really like those, though.
[144:20.34]I don't like the slam.
[144:21.12]It's too close.
[144:26.48]That R1 is really good, though.
[144:32.10]Curved Greatswords or Pog.
[144:33.68]They seem like it.
[144:34.26]Okay, well, let's keep going.
[144:39.78]Brave Glove for 9.
[144:41.38]That's probably almost the max, right?
[144:53.83]Is Glovewort 10 the max?
[144:56.77]Just checking.
[144:59.79]I know.
[145:02.89]Wait a minute.
[145:07.65]I haven't been down here.
[145:08.43]It looks like I was down there.
[145:10.35]Wasn't I down here?
[145:11.49]Was I not down here?
[145:12.15]Okay.
[145:20.57]What's over here?
[145:30.89]Wait, why is this open?
[145:31.85]Wait, what?
[145:39.35]What?
[145:40.15]When did I open that?
[145:45.85]Oh, shit.
[145:47.47]That's... Um... First one that I pulled...
[146:03.58]Oh, fuck.
[146:04.32]It's a Mog.
[146:05.82]It's Mog.
[146:06.56]It's a regular Mog.
[146:11.82]Yeah?
[146:12.20]Oh, is that what you're gonna try to do?
[146:13.68]Fucking Mog Jr.
[146:21.23]Dude, fight this guy back here.
[146:22.29]Fight this guy back here.
[146:26.69]Get out of here.
[146:44.46]Okay.
[146:46.14]We just have to fight one more regular ass Mog.
[146:49.68]And that's it.
[146:51.04]And then I can keep progressing.
[146:52.92]It's just one Mog and he's got the sword.
[146:54.92]It's the one that I don't like to fight.
[147:15.96]Got it.
[147:16.86]Good.
[147:22.34]Hey, God.
[147:23.98]Golden rune 11.
[147:24.46]All right.
[147:25.36]The mog room has been defeated.
[147:26.59]Why does it look like I can go back here?
[147:35.91]That looks like I can go back there, right?
[147:37.09]Kind of weird.
[147:42.72]Yeah, man.
[147:43.04]You beat Mog.
[147:43.82]Yeah, I know.
[147:44.46]But... So, that... I... That was the first one that I pulled.
[147:48.62]Because I pulled a lever already.
[147:51.78]So, there's another one.
[147:52.64]Okay.
[147:59.96]So, I need to pull the second lever, which... I guess I'm going to go over here.
[148:11.22]Oh, I went down there already.
[148:12.12]Is there a place I didn't go?
[148:22.96]Uh, this way.
[148:36.68]Uh... Wait.
[148:41.62]I was already here.
[148:42.12]I may have left.
[148:50.18]Um, didn't I... I don't know what kind of fucking bog trickery this is, but... I didn't... Okay, I didn't go this way.
[149:19.88]Wait.
[149:20.84]Wait, what?
[149:24.34]Why is he back?
[149:26.18]I'm not fighting him.
[149:27.22]This is weird.
[149:27.78]What's going on?
[149:37.35]Where's the... He revived.
[149:59.93]Holy shit, he kicked over my fucking head.
[150:07.81]Stun him!
[150:09.37]All right.
[150:22.52]Alright, there's two mogs dead here.
[150:30.98]Am I going to come back and there's going to be a third one?
[150:33.56]What's up there?
[150:45.44]I did this, but is this different now?
[150:54.06]This brings me back up to that room with this guy in it.
[150:56.70]And then... Wait.
[151:01.50]This is different.
[151:10.25]Dude, weren't we doing something?
[151:13.85]You know what I mean?
[151:14.49]Like, we were doing something.
[151:16.81]I'm in this dungeon now.
[151:18.23]What happened?
[151:19.80]How did I even get here?
[151:23.80]I actually don't even know how I got here.
[151:26.06]I was like looking for the dung guy and then all of a sudden I'm in one of these dungeons?
[151:30.89]I don't know how this happened.
[151:31.87]Okay, so this is... I go down this ladder?
[151:56.74]Where does this go?
[152:09.50]Oh, shit!
[152:10.24]There it is.
[152:12.17]But don't get killed.
[152:13.27]Wait.
[152:14.71]Somebody's gonna jump me here.
[152:17.23]Somebody's gonna push me off the edge.
[152:18.29]Okay, so that's to the... Now I can go back to the entrance, right?
[152:27.64]And that should be the... The... That should be it.
[152:31.80]There's a bonfire right there.
[152:34.94]I think.
[152:36.36]I hope this is right.
[152:41.00]Now if I go this way, it should be right here.
[152:42.48]Right?
[152:54.23]Dude, how do I get out of here?
[153:00.21]This is also new.
[153:01.17]You weren't here before, were you?
[153:04.55]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[153:06.18]You going the wrong way?
[153:06.86]Uh, so back this way and then through the other door?
[153:20.10]There's no way out.
[153:23.94]Sorry, you were actually going the right way, was I?
[153:31.90]As long as I can sit at a bonfire, and then it's the door right next to here.
[153:35.06]Okay, this is it right here.
[153:36.31]And there's the bonfire.
[153:37.89]Alright, nice.
[153:38.31]That was kind of weird.
[153:41.87]I have to pee real bad.
[153:43.31]So we're going to walk in here, probably die, and then I'm going to go pee.
[153:52.41]Five golden seeds, really?
[153:56.21]Ten and two is fine.
[154:01.23]I kind of... I'm going to lose all these runes probably, but I want to see what it is.
[154:05.17]Let's find out.
[154:09.96]See if I can do it first try.
[154:10.90]Both headphones going in.
[154:11.80]Let's see if I can get it.
[154:13.86]If this is three mogs, I'm going to be very mad.
[154:22.73]Esgar, Priest of Blood.
[154:25.23]Come right up on me, huh?
[154:28.01]I can do that.
[154:38.44]Yo!
[155:05.50]What are these fucking bugs?
[155:06.38]Get out of here.
[155:06.86]Oi oi oi oi!
[155:40.01]Did I die?
[155:41.03]Oh, he did.
[155:41.81]Okay.
[155:42.15]Let's go.
[155:45.91]Lord of Blood's Exultation.
[155:50.11]That was kind of scary.
[156:07.33]Blood loss in vicinity increases attack power.
[156:13.77]When blood loss occurs in... Okay, I don't understand this.
[156:17.30]What does this mean?
[156:22.28]When blood loss occurs... Does that... Okay, I don't understand this.
[156:25.98]Does that mean if I get blood loss, my attack power goes up?
[156:29.56]Or does that mean if somebody has attack power, blood power, then it goes up if I'm in the area?
[156:35.76]I have to be bled first.
[156:36.84]Like, I have to be bled.
[156:41.32]When bloodlust occurs in the vicinity.
[156:46.74]Any enemy or you.
[156:49.94]Oh, okay.
[156:50.48]That's cool.
[156:52.02]This is really good.
[156:54.50]That was kind of a cool dungeon.
[156:55.90]I guess we did it.
[156:59.60]It's either you or the enemy.
[157:00.62]Okay, cool.
[157:05.22]So... I don't even... We were... Yeah, we went, like, all the way back here.
[157:13.21]Alright, I gotta remember.
[157:15.23]I gotta pee.
[157:16.79]Let's pee.
[157:17.05]I'll be right back.
[157:18.49]Give me, like... I don't know.
[157:20.71]Two minutes?
[157:21.15]Three minutes?
[157:22.41]Maybe?
[157:39.57]Thank you.
[158:40.67]Thank you.
[160:12.34]Thank you.
[161:10.81]so so
[162:40.06]Amen.
[163:27.82]You know something?
[163:29.60]For the first time in a long time, my room is not like 80 degrees.
[163:36.32]It's actually kind of nice in here.
[163:37.72]I wonder what happened.
[163:43.38]Have you played Cuphead?
[163:44.54]I streamed Cuphead and I beat the game.
[163:49.02]That's available to watch as a video on demand.
[163:52.62]I did play it.
[163:53.44]I'm going to play the DLC when it comes out.
[164:01.37]Real fans.
[164:06.41]You beat Cophead?
[164:07.09]Yeah.
[164:07.95]I'm looking forward to the DLC.
[164:11.89]Turn the audio back up.
[164:12.85]Alright, I really needed to pee, apparently.
[164:16.75]That was kind of ridiculous.
[164:20.59]Am I too blown out?
[164:21.27]Maybe.
[164:25.32]Alright.
[164:26.72]So, I need to figure out... How much is to level up?
[164:31.39]I can definitely do it.
[164:36.58]Did I tell you about how I want to do a run?
[164:39.06]Where I don't break any of these for the entire playthrough until like the last third of the game.
[164:45.42]So just save up like 200 of these.
[164:47.56]And then get like a million souls in one minute.
[164:50.23]And then level up like 30 times.
[164:51.35]I feel like that'd be like kind of fun.
[164:54.81]Alright, I need a lot more than that.
[165:04.24]You'll only level up twice.
[165:05.39]Not with this many.
[165:08.09]There are a lot of these in the game.
[165:09.21]There are a ton.
[165:13.65]How's my camera moving?
[165:17.03]How's the mouse moving my camera?
[165:20.06]I need 60 something thousand.
[165:21.72]Maybe one of these will do it.
[165:24.64]Okay.
[165:27.48]I'm still going to go with endurance.
[165:28.68]I feel like that's important.
[165:30.70]Get it to 20.
[165:31.96]Once endurance is 20...
[165:34.93]Then, and only then, will I start putting points into mind.
[165:38.79]And that's pretty much where I'm going to end.
[165:40.07]I'll probably end up doing that till the end.
[165:42.07]Maybe a little bit more intelligence.
[165:47.65]Okay.
[165:49.49]So where the hell was I going?
[165:53.37]It was this little cave here.
[165:54.57]And then there's an elevator that went back up.
[165:59.74]So I want to stay down here.
[166:01.76]Right?
[166:01.94]Okay.
[166:04.92]Is it where the lobsters are?
[166:08.68]Is there another way to go from the lobsters?
[166:10.22]Go to the roadside grace?
[166:20.33]I'm already underground.
[166:25.35]I think it is back up.
[166:26.51]Okay.
[166:34.88]This doesn't count as an underground map, does it?
[166:37.51]Interesting, okay.
[166:40.33]There's a hole in the floor near the grace.
[166:43.59]Well, let me just go up.
[166:57.74]Okay.
[166:59.02]Yeah, so then... This takes me back out of here...
[167:10.68]Which leads out to where all those imps were, right?
[167:23.43]Okay.
[167:25.37]Fuck you?
[167:25.87]What?
[167:26.14]Where am I?
[167:27.32]Oh, right.
[167:27.78]Right, right.
[167:28.14]Okay, okay, okay.
[167:28.72]Okay, now... Um... I can go up.
[167:33.36]Do I want to go up?
[167:35.14]Do I want to climb this?
[167:45.91]Fuck you, Mog 3!
[167:52.01]It's a ballsy move!
[167:55.73]I made it!
[167:56.11]What are you gonna do?
[168:01.08]You can't climb this.
[168:03.92]Good.
[168:04.42]Alright.
[168:08.74]Interesting.
[168:10.13]VERY interesting.
[168:13.97]Is Rest of the Grace nearby?
[168:17.59]Is that the hole you were talking about?
[168:28.55]No.
[168:30.14]They can climb.
[168:31.04]This guy is not climbing this ladder.
[168:33.04]I am assuring you of this.
[168:34.94]This is not a chance in hell.
[168:40.28]This is where I came from.
[168:43.50]Oh, fuck, you're right.
[168:44.64]Okay, well, let's go... Let me go rest at the bonfire and get my bearings here.
[168:48.01]Okay, so... That door is locked.
[169:05.23]Was there another way I could go from here?
[169:07.03]I could go down there again.
[169:10.49]Like the imps were.
[169:11.21]I don't think there's anything else over there.
[169:20.92]I feel like there's probably somewhere... Okay.
[169:22.52]So I gotta get up there.
[169:25.06]How do I get up there?
[169:30.08]I went all the way down.
[169:36.13]All right, so from here, can't really... Really?
[169:50.20]Get out of here.
[170:02.34]Alright, I can go that way.
[170:05.76]Get the fuck out of here.
[170:06.96]There's too many of you.
[170:07.76]We're going to go this way.
[170:11.67]Oh my god, no we're not.
[170:14.01]Are there 200 of you?
[170:16.21]Where are they coming from?
[170:18.41]Why is there like a Minecraft monster spawner right here?
[170:22.79]Fall, fall.
[170:23.43]Go back up the hole in the floor.
[170:24.63]Go back, go back, go back, go back, go back.
[170:25.91]Go back to grace.
[170:26.55]Go back, go back.
[170:27.15]What? What? What?
[170:31.41]Go back! Go back! Go back!
[170:34.35]What?
[170:34.53]Go back! Go back!
[170:35.91]Alright I'm going back.
[170:37.07]Relax
[170:42.27]This is not even the right one.
[170:51.27]You fell for it.
[170:51.27]That was too many people saying "Go back".
[171:02.48]There's a hole in the floor?
[171:03.72]I don't see a hole in the floor.
[171:08.87]Right here?
[171:10.81]Is this a hole in the floor?
[171:19.51]Hole in the floor?
[171:32.29]Hey dude, yo, there's a hole in the floor.
[171:36.30]What hole?
[171:36.86]There's a hole in the floor?
[171:38.98]You need to go north.
[171:45.18]Is there a hole over here?
[171:49.14]Oh, a hole in the floor!
[171:49.90]I found a hole in the floor!
[171:50.70]Oh shit, hole in the floor.
[172:12.46]We did it.
[172:13.70]You guys did do it.
[172:14.32]Thank you.
[172:16.20]I would have just completely glossed over this.
[172:31.84]Were you in one of the boxes?
[172:41.43]If a rat kills me... If a rat kills me, seriously, I have to eat a ghost pepper.
[172:46.73]Like, honest to god.
[173:00.48]What happened to the paper Mario stream uh yeah, I kind of just like didn't do it.
[173:03.78]I just like didn't really feel like it It's so funny because
[173:10.90]Yeah, guys, I'm not gonna be streaming that often anymore.
[173:13.24]Uh, games that are... Games that are more than, like, 30 to 40 hours, I'm definitely not gonna be able to do them.
[173:20.07]I'm not gonna really get into them.
[173:22.31]And I've streamed, like, a hundred fucking hours of Dark... of, uh, Elden Ring.
[173:26.98]So, yeah, I've... Yeah, I get it, but... I'm not as passionate about Paper Mario than I am as Elden Ring, okay?
[173:37.98]I don't have the real passion for Paper Mario.
[173:41.82]I think it's cool.
[173:42.68]I think it looks fun.
[173:45.04]Cool.
[173:52.74]It looks fun.
[173:53.44]Did they make this better?
[174:04.75]Not really.
[174:05.75]Takes way too much mana.
[174:13.32]This is one comet.
[174:14.82]Yeah.
[174:15.50]Why would you ever use that?
[174:16.64]I guess maybe the... Why is it so dark in here?
[174:24.21]Dang, I got Starlight.
[174:32.21]Okay.
[174:37.12]Why do I keep getting points?
[174:45.25]Oh fuck.
[175:16.41]Fuck you.
[175:19.29]Put that shit away.
[175:20.85]The stone sword key.
[175:32.84]Ooh.
[175:41.08]Any more of these I can open?
[175:46.00]Don't believe so.
[175:46.62]Damn, this guy's good.
[175:52.64]Oh, fuck.
[175:53.52]I can't cast this.
[175:54.37]I don't have enough mana.
[175:57.19]Wait.
[175:59.33]Yeah, I do.
[175:59.95]I can eat one of these.
[176:05.07]Use to gradually recover FP.
[176:06.93]Use!
[176:15.31]We're good.
[176:25.69]Oh my god.
[176:26.41]Oh.
[176:27.49]Guys, I had one hit.
[176:32.12]I'm not going to use mana.
[176:35.68]I can't even reach this one.
[176:56.34]There's so many here.
[177:02.68]Not that dangerous, but, I mean... What if I need to run down here?
[177:05.76]Something's gonna chase me down this fucking tunnel.
[177:15.21]Yeah.
[177:25.92]Ugh, what the fuck?
[177:28.04]Not an illusion?
[177:32.08]Okay.
[177:35.86]I'm like unclogging the drain.
[177:39.01]I'm gonna come out and there's gonna be running water in the capital.
[177:52.58]They're gonna be all clapping for me.
[178:03.73]Okay, I can go the other way too.
[178:05.27]What was that?
[178:15.14]Hole right there.
[178:15.78]I don't want to fall through that shit.
[178:26.77]Rainbow arrow?
[178:35.47]Wait.
[178:40.26]Dude, this is so... Where am I?
[178:43.28]I'm just going... I'm not even going to attack these things anymore.
[178:52.66]What's the point?
[179:01.67]Fuck.
[179:08.44]Need to clean up the sewers.
[179:09.64]I hope there's a bonfire or something down here.
[179:16.22]That cast speed on that is so good now.
[179:25.91]Oh god.
[179:32.74]Oh god, I don't like this.
[179:34.90]I don't like this at all.
[179:36.62]I actually don't like this at all.
[179:47.02]I gotta keep Starlight on call here because something's gonna come out here.
[180:06.53]Oh, no, no, no, not one of these guys.
[180:08.61]Not one of these guys.
[180:10.05]Not one of these things.
[180:11.67]What do I do?
[180:12.03]What do I do?
[180:12.38]What do I do?
[180:12.74]Just kill it.
[180:41.22]It's too dark!
[180:53.08]Fuck you, man!
[180:54.48]I don't know how to fight you without a horse!
[180:55.96]Ah!
[181:06.82]Dude, why the fuck are you supposed to fight this guy?
[181:19.37]Ah!
[181:23.29]Shit!
[181:28.36]Oh my god, that guy's so horrible.
[181:33.60]It was like, I do even have the same.
[181:35.24]There aren't even enough frames to attack him before he attacks you again.
[181:38.52]I can't even call the boys.
[181:48.17]I can't call them.
[181:49.67]They're not available.
[181:57.25]I'm like, I don't know how to get down there again.
[181:58.87]It's going to be a nightmare.
[182:09.45]Okay, so wait.
[182:10.18]There's like two ways to go.
[182:13.10]Look that way.
[182:14.80]That guy is almost impossible on foot.
[182:19.52]Alright, there's two ways I could go.
[182:21.24]We're going this way.
[182:24.73]Okay.
[182:42.05]Remember, I baked cookies.
[182:43.14]Oh, that sounds awesome.
[182:43.80]It actually sounds incredible.
[182:46.50]What kind of cookies?
[182:51.98]And by the way, soft or chewy cookies.
[182:54.22]Very important.
[183:00.15]Okay.
[183:08.22]They just put every awful enemy in the game down here.
[183:11.44]Like, these guys are fucking worse too.
[183:21.40]There goes 23 Calvins.
[183:34.49]What the fuck?
[183:35.25]I hate the hands.
[183:38.34]That was a big hand, too.
[183:39.64]That was just a huge hand.
[183:40.98]Do I have to kill that thing?
[183:43.30]Chat.
[183:44.12]Chat.
[183:44.56]Hey, chat.
[183:45.36]Tell me now.
[183:46.10]Do I have to kill that thing?
[183:47.37]Chat.
[183:47.75]Tell me now.
[183:55.13]I'm going that way.
[183:56.63]That guy with the crown, that goes... ...and dashes around and teleports and does like 12 frames of attack animation when you have two frames that you can move.
[184:08.00]I don't want to fight that guy.
[184:09.80]I want to go down there later and kill him.
[184:17.86]Okay.
[184:20.36]Oh, wow.
[184:23.24]Look at that.
[184:45.97]Fucking Starlight, stay on.
[185:00.80]What?!
[185:01.38]Why did he not... That's so confusing to me.
[185:07.25]Who's screaming?
[185:07.95]Somebody's yelling!
[185:10.77]What was that?
[185:14.17]Who's making that noise?
[185:15.55]I don't know, I feel like someone was just mocking me.
[185:33.08]Oh, thank fucking AlphaStyle, I like it.
[185:38.81]Okay, so I'm just gonna go buy a lantern.
[185:40.77]Because I fucking don't want to keep casting this stupid fucking move.
[185:55.10]Is it brighter?
[185:55.80]And by the way, this hand is dying now.
[185:58.32]I hate these enemies.
[186:00.44]It's the worst enemy in the whole game.
[186:04.28]It is the worst enemy in the game.
[186:06.51]I hate them.
[186:07.23]I think it's awful.
[186:08.63]I don't like the design choices around them.
[186:11.35]I think they're too big.
[186:12.59]I think they have too wide of an arc.
[186:14.71]Their damage hitbox is like 250 degrees in front of them.
[186:22.18]They're too fast.
[186:23.08]They have way too much stamina.
[186:24.80]You know what?
[186:25.52]I don't even care.
[186:26.22]It's not going to happen again, is it?
[186:28.40]It is.
[186:37.66]Oh my god, dude.
[186:39.68]Alright, alright.
[186:40.44]Is it gonna kill me?
[186:47.60]Then, you know, if I can, yeah, you know.
[187:07.52]Thank you.
[187:26.97]What's that?
[187:49.02]I'm gonna be alive.
[187:49.79]It's fine.
[187:53.05]Wait, don't get out of the flowers.
[187:56.05]They're blocking the fucking ladder now.
[187:58.74]You can't get out of the fucking way.
[188:00.86]He's got like a million health.
[188:09.81]Oh my, why is he here?
[188:21.47]stagger I can't even hit it I facing the wrong way
[188:45.72]I knew he was gonna do it.
[189:02.03]Alright.
[189:04.29]I'm poisoned, but it's okay.
[189:05.59]I'm just gonna chill for a sec.
[189:10.15]This guy's almost dead.
[189:11.81]Like, actually pretty much dead.
[189:13.03]I need to do one more cast on him.
[189:14.19]Worst enemy in the game, by the way.
[189:19.75]Without a question in my mind Hey, hey!
[189:34.96]You're supposed to be dead!
[189:39.18]Don't get Starlight!
[190:00.94]Jesus, kill it!
[190:02.16]Do... Dude!
[190:04.14]I... You... These enemies are the hardest enemy for me in the game.
[190:08.38]Oh!
[190:08.62]Okay, these are... Whatever, I don't even care.
[190:14.99]This enemy's the bane of my entire existence.
[190:18.03]Use fire?
[190:18.83]I'm not a... I'm not a... I have magical spells.
[190:21.87]I don't have fire spells.
[190:23.61]I guess I could throw a canister at him.
[190:29.60]Okay, we're good.
[190:32.37]Jesus.
[190:35.69]Look, somebody was screaming back here.
[190:43.38]Oh, that's him!
[190:43.98]Let me out.
[190:48.60]Let me out of here.
[190:52.87]Must eat more.
[190:55.45]Defile more.
[190:58.54]everything that matters to you for generations to come.
[191:04.99]I am the Dung Eater, a scourge upon the living.
[191:38.45]Throw some shit at him.
[191:42.39]Kill him.
[191:42.83]Do not kill.
[191:43.79]Don't kill him.
[191:44.65]Do not kill.
[191:45.56]Kill him.
[191:47.52]I am killing this motherfucker.
[191:50.60]This guy told me he was gonna kill me, eat me, defile my corpse.
[191:55.12]This guy's dead.
[191:58.67]Don't.
[192:01.38]I'm going in there, and I'm just gonna fucking start R1-ing as hard as I can.
[192:09.48]Ah!
[192:20.51]I don't know what to do!
[192:25.23]I don't know what to do!
[192:26.13]I don't know what to do.
[192:26.85]This guy's fucking weird.
[192:27.85]I don't like this guy.
[192:34.38]Leave your jail?
[192:35.76]I don't know.
[192:42.68]Should I let this guy out?
[192:43.76]This guy's a sicko.
[192:44.94]Oh, we're being bad.
[192:55.83]This is evil.
[193:04.28]Just to be sure that when they're reborn, they'll be cursed.
[193:11.67]Along with their children.
[193:12.77]I'm about to start R1-ing.
[193:13.99]And their children's children.
[193:17.39]For all time.
[193:19.13]I'm about to start R1-ing right now.
[193:21.37]This guy's a fucking evil maniac.
[193:24.73]I will kill again.
[193:26.21]Just to be sure they'll be cursed.
[193:38.20]Don't kill.
[193:39.26]Kill him.
[193:46.99]I don't wanna live to live!
[193:48.67]He's gonna kill somebody.
[193:50.29]And it's gonna be somebody I like.
[193:53.17]I don't like this guy, okay?
[193:57.63]I don't like this guy.
[194:02.43]But I feel like it's an interesting thing that can happen.
[194:05.29]I don't know.
[194:09.80]I'm very curious what happens if you let this guy live.
[194:12.46]I have no idea.
[194:14.54]But it's terrifying.
[194:23.25]I'm having such a conflict right now.
[194:24.71]Do I want to see the interesting thing play out?
[194:29.79]Or do I want to save potentially the lives of the people at the round table hold?
[194:35.49]Because he's probably going to go there and he's probably going to kill like three people.
[194:44.94]Alright.
[194:51.43]I'm sticking with, we're going with pure evil route.
[194:54.63]Pure evil.
[194:56.73]Let's go.
[195:00.03]I did it.
[195:00.60]Pure evil route.
[195:01.76]I'm very curious what happens.
[195:13.19]You good?
[195:13.39]Evil.
[195:13.49]You can have this prayer book.
[195:14.57]Can you stick around and help me kill this guy that's about to rampage us here?
[195:44.66]Like, we need to stick together.
[195:46.78]Because I let a guy out of... I let this guy out of prison.
[195:49.96]And he's going to come and kill us all.
[195:51.85]So, like, we should all work together.
[196:02.13]What were those incantations?
[196:04.02]Flame for... Increases fire damage.
[196:08.16]Spark flame from... This shit is so cold.
[196:12.38]May the golden...
[196:26.39]Oh, no!
[196:31.05]I'll defile you next.
[196:32.84]Come to the outer moat.
[196:36.88]Wait, I'm getting challenged?
[196:47.49]I'm getting challenged?
[196:48.43]Meet him out at the outer moat?
[196:56.09]Here's the moat.
[196:59.55]Outer wall.
[197:01.23]Outer wall.
[197:03.79]I mean, the moat's right here.
[197:05.41]I'm going to assume it's this one here.
[197:06.37]I'm kind of terrified.
[197:21.70]He's, like, coming to get me.
[197:40.25]Lake below the tree on the map.
[197:43.13]Alright.
[197:46.49]I'm actually terrified right now.
[197:51.68]Below... Yep.
[197:54.08]You should really explore the top left area.
[197:55.92]This is consequences.
[198:04.04]I'm actually scared.
[198:05.24]I don't know what's going to happen here.
[198:25.56]I thought that was him for a second.
[198:26.58]I was like, why is he coming out of the ground?
[198:30.40]I don't want him to kill me.
[198:33.34]No, I'm not.
[198:34.10]I'm going to try as hard as I can to not die.
[198:36.12]He said he was going to defile.
[198:37.76]He's going to curse me and shit.
[198:39.42]I got to kill this guy first try.
[198:40.98]Is he actually going to fight me or is that just bullshit?
[199:04.10]Oh, no.
[199:50.92]I thought that was him for a second.
[199:51.94]Is that him?
[200:10.46]Oh fuck.
[200:10.94]Oh my god.
[200:11.32]I'm off the horse.
[200:11.74]Oh my god.
[200:14.58]Get away from me.
[200:15.42]Bugs.
[200:15.80]I don't want to deal with a fucking bug right now.
[200:33.71]Did he say bless you?
[200:40.96]That's not fair.
[200:41.96]Wait, what?
[200:43.98]Why does he get a friend?
[200:44.96]Can he kill him too?
[200:47.74]Please attack him.
[200:50.36]Bless you.
[200:50.92]Oh my god, he can kill him.
[200:56.02]Come on, crab friend.
[201:00.27]Kill him!
[201:01.83]Kill him!
[201:03.55]Oh shit, don't kill me!
[201:04.91]No!
[201:05.99]I can't get defiled!
[201:12.55]Oh fuck, please!
[201:17.03]Get over here and help me!
[201:17.97]I got him!
[201:30.93]Oh, he's not dead.
[201:31.73]He's fucking dead.
[201:32.61]He's dead?
[201:33.15]Did I beat him?
[201:34.69]Did I get him?
[201:38.95]He was fucking easy.
[201:47.01]Sword of Milos.
[201:57.34]What happened?
[202:00.14]Don't defile me!
[202:00.94]Is he gonna defile me?
[202:09.15]That doesn't count, right?
[202:10.78]That doesn't count?
[202:11.80]Like, if I died in the fight, he's dead, right?
[202:14.26]I'm not gonna get a bad ending?
[202:24.01]He said if he killed me that he was going to defile me and like give me a curse.
[202:35.25]I don't think that happened though, right?
[202:36.67]No, I'm good.
[202:39.64]Alright, so I got Sword of Milos.
[202:48.58]What was that?
[202:54.74]I think it was crazy looking.
[202:55.70]There it is.
[202:58.42]Sword of Milos.
[202:59.42]D and D strength in dex.
[203:03.54]The Greatsword.
[203:04.34]Wow.
[203:08.58]From a giant's backbone.
[203:13.45]Milos was undersized for a giant and was viewed as sullied and terribly grotesque.
[203:21.15]The Scream.
[203:25.63]Oh, that's what he was doing.
[203:28.25]I think it's cool.
[203:39.46]It's cool.
[203:42.24]This is cool.
[203:46.92]Wow.
[203:49.08]There's a three-hit combo for R2.
[203:51.25]That's actually really good.
[204:03.11]over here all right well that was cool so now I'm gonna go I go back to the sewer because that was an invader that wasn't even him back to the round table
[204:36.74]That sword's really cool, though.
[204:37.86]Alright, so what happens now?
[204:39.30]Is there something there?
[204:46.16]You didn't do the shrimp guy quest.
[205:00.65]I didn't.
[205:05.42]He's back.
[205:07.00]So what's the problem?
[205:07.76]What the fuck?
[205:15.17]There you are.
[205:16.61]I kicked the shit out of you.
[205:17.41]I warded off my blessing despite the curse stirring within you.
[205:22.87]No one has succeeded in that before.
[205:25.83]How?
[205:26.87]I thought.
[205:28.82]Then it hit me that you are, in fact, me.
[205:34.32]And I am the dog eater.
[205:38.56]It is my flesh that must receive the blessing.
[205:46.57]Give me your blessing.
[205:48.77]Defile my flesh with the seedbed curse.
[205:52.61]Again and again.
[205:54.07]Until it is done.
[205:56.95]Until a cursed ring coalesces that may one day defile order itself.
[206:02.97]Countless I have killed.
[206:05.43]And countless I have defiled.
[206:07.63]Wait, we're like friends now?
[206:10.77]Hundreds will be reborn cursed.
[206:14.06]And they'll bear thousands of cursed children.
[206:17.82]Who'll bear tens of thousands more.
[206:20.93]A few of those will be born.
[206:22.23]Jeremy Elberton.
[206:23.33]The dung guzzle.
[206:24.43]And they'll kill.
[206:25.93]And defile.
[206:27.89]And bless in my stead.
[206:30.31]The rotten fools.
[206:32.95]My fight was the grandest.
[206:35.69]Most brilliant of them all.
[206:39.36]So... Yeah.
[206:40.46]Uh-huh.
[206:40.88]So... Hold on.
[206:41.32]Where is it?
[206:41.82]I have it.
[206:42.34]I own it.
[206:42.68]Where is it?
[206:43.26]Purse grown on a body defiled by the Dung Eater.
[207:10.41]This is 1 out of 99.
[207:11.29]Okay.
[207:15.06]Oh, it was nice to meet you.
[207:17.74]What is this gigantic patch on my chest?
[207:20.38]I haven't even looked.
[207:25.84]This is like a cardboard shield that you would give to a 10-year-old.
[207:31.38]You go dress up as a knight for Halloween.
[207:33.86]What is that?
[207:35.46]Alright, well anyways, that was kind of cool.
[207:42.52]There's like a bunch in the game that you've totally, permanently missed by now.
[207:46.16]Oh, oh well.
[207:50.52]I did get some more stones.
[207:52.38]I wonder if I got enough to do the staff.
[207:59.94]That was cool.
[208:00.66]That was really nerve-wracking.
[208:02.47]I have to go back to the sewer, though?
[208:05.91]Or should I hold off on that and go actual game progress now?
[208:13.47]Talk to the spirit girl.
[208:16.02]Please take care.
[208:17.42]Okay.
[208:17.88]Huh?
[208:39.08]I feel like I'm really coming to grips with spirit tuning of late.
[208:42.58]Learning.
[208:43.22]I can see how and why immortal essence exists.
[208:47.40]That's a U. I can understand their yearnings.
[208:50.68]What they become drawn to.
[208:52.38]Master Hugh said it himself, actually.
[208:55.52]That I'm no mere apprentice any longer.
[208:58.26]Once again, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.
[209:01.90]Roderika, the certified spirit tuner.
[209:05.24]Hooray!
[209:07.03]You did it.
[209:07.45]Nice job.

[209:43.97]This thing is now the real deal.
[209:47.97]Go talk to Fia.
[209:48.87]It's Fia the hug lady.
[209:57.06]Oh, I see you've had presence of the two fingers.
[210:02.00]Ah, yes.
[210:03.04]Seems you've talked to the two fingers.
[210:09.84]That's progress.
[210:10.34]Unlocated demigods.
[210:10.98]Four?
[210:33.69]Wait.
[210:33.83]Wait.
[210:34.13]Because I did her quest.
[210:35.63]You already did Rani's quest, yep.
[211:04.23]I- okay.
[211:09.49]Hello, final boss of the game.
[211:11.39]It's you.
[211:13.11]I'm gonna do all this work, I'm gonna get all the great runes, and he's gonna be like, oh, tarnished.
[211:17.57]Excellent work.
[211:18.43]He's gonna, like, do, like, the villain walk-on clap.
[211:21.71]And he's gonna stand in front of the fucking Elden tree thing.
[211:25.57]And he's gonna- he's the final boss.
[211:27.63]It's gonna be this guy.
[211:29.75]Like, he's gonna steal my thunder because it was gonna be me.
[211:33.04]And, turns out, turns out, you don't want to fucking be the Elden Lord, because it's horrible, right?
[211:40.49]And he's going to be like, what?
[211:41.71]What's happening to me?
[211:42.73]No!
[211:43.85]And it's going to be like this horrible, horrible thing, and he's going to be like, I'm glad it didn't happen to me.
[211:49.60]That's what I think is going to happen.
[211:53.68]That's my, where this is going for me.
[211:57.97]It's a Disney ending.
[212:02.76]Okay, let me talk to the hug lady, and then I'm going to go that way.
[212:10.29]I'm going to go... I could go this way, or I could go over here.
[212:17.49]Or I didn't explore that much over here either.
[212:21.16]So many places to fucking go.
[212:23.38]I haven't seen any... Look at this road.
[212:24.94]This goes this way.
[212:28.04]So that's interesting.
[212:30.32]Then it's this way.
[212:31.06]Close the guide.
[212:34.26]Please do top left.
[212:37.06]I mean, top left to me, this is like the end of the game, right?
[212:43.59]Oh, go to the Grand Lift of Rold and go set the tree aflame, right?
[212:50.65]That's endgame stuff, I imagine.
[212:54.28]So in the meantime, let me just see what else is over here.
[213:03.74]And let me talk to the hug lady.
[213:09.08]This game's pretty good.
[213:13.14]Where's the hug lady?
[213:13.76]No.
[213:22.83]Okay.
[213:33.34]Do I have any Deathroot?
[213:34.24]This guy... Idiot, why?
[213:51.90]What?
[213:52.12]Let her hug you.
[214:01.30]No.
[214:01.52]Hug to talk to her.
[214:03.40]I don't want to hug her.
[214:08.07]So I can get the fucking Baldi's basic blessing.
[214:12.03]Whatever it is.
[214:12.53]I don't know.
[214:13.49]I don't want it.
[214:15.45]Fine.
[214:16.56]You got a lantern.
[214:26.62]Have you ever seen Starlight Kid?
[214:28.20]May I ask a favor?
[214:29.08]Could you please find the owner of this dagger and return it to them?
[214:50.63]Weathered dagger.
[214:51.41]What was her name?
[214:52.15]Thanks.
[214:52.35]Owner of the dagger.
[214:53.13]Very precious.
[214:54.21]Thanks for telling me anything.
[215:16.52]You know what the most annoying part about this is?
[215:17.98]Instead of her just telling me what the person's name is, she engraved it on the weapon, and, like, I have to read it.
[215:25.54]This belonged to Godric the Brave.
[215:28.94]Okay, yeah, and he resides in Castle Fortnite.
[215:32.07]Like, she just can't tell me that.
[215:34.03]Like, just tell me.
[215:34.85]Why do I have to read the engraving?
[215:37.63]To a certain someone.
[215:42.50]He wishes for the return of his rival owner.
[215:43.98]It was once a special weapon of gold and silver intertwined, but is now worn down and marred.
[215:48.03]Okay, it doesn't say it on it.
[215:51.67]I don't know who this belongs to.
[215:57.93]I thought it said Fortnite Grave.
[216:02.68]Oh, I have this poison.
[216:06.01]Right?
[216:07.21]Small flask from Celevis containing a cloudy tonic.
[216:11.03]It's poison.
[216:11.81]Find Nephile and ensure that she... Didn't we come across this person?
[216:19.03]I feel like I know who that person is.
[216:20.19]But I don't know where they are now.
[216:25.64]That person's dead.
[216:30.44]Okay, they are.
[216:36.09]Wait, it's this person's dagger?
[216:40.09]You- why can't you just walk in the other room?
[216:44.07]Wha- how?
[216:46.25]Why not just- okay, it's like- it's like somebody's car keys.
[216:49.47]I found a pair of car keys, does this belong to anybody?
[216:52.46]Oh shit, yeah, yeah, that's mine.
[216:53.82]Is that for a Subaru?
[216:54.80]Like wha- how come I have to do this?
[216:56.66]Well, what have we here?
[216:59.90]How did you get your hands on that dagger?
[217:03.60]Mine.
[217:04.76]Okay.
[217:04.90]Now what?
[217:05.40]Rest.
[217:33.03]This motherfucker's gone.
[217:33.75]This is gone.
[217:35.69]Okay, so, did you see where he went?
[217:37.35]Okay.
[217:51.66]I feel like I'm missing some context.
[217:53.28]What happened?
[217:53.72]You alright?
[217:54.09]Why are you telling me this?
[218:16.24]That is the context.
[218:16.94]They killed his friend.
[218:18.32]Oh.
[218:18.64]Okay.
[218:18.90]Where's, um... Where's this guy?
[218:20.04]Two fingers?
[218:20.40]Okay.
[218:20.58]Alright.
[218:21.18]Eat this blessing.
[218:22.12]I don't want it on me anymore.
[218:52.16]So now, it's time.
[218:53.88]I have the options now.
[218:59.90]He's still here.
[219:04.93]Is he?
[219:06.79]Oh, he was talking a lot of shit about you.
[219:08.35]Uh-oh.
[219:14.27]No, I like this guy.
[219:15.57]This guy gave me my first weapon.
[219:16.79]Remember he gave me the plus eight rip here?
[219:20.51]I like this guy.
[219:24.23]That's sad.
[219:24.95]He's like one of my favorite NPCs.
[219:27.13]He helped us so early.
[219:28.35]Remember how excited I was to get that weapon?
[219:41.99]Where?
[219:42.19]Okay, so you say he's still here?
[219:43.59]Down here maybe?
[219:53.31]He's saying he's still here.
[219:54.17]Okay.
[220:22.28]Blind one.
[220:25.40]prayer assassins prayer book got faith faith faith faith faith you know I mean the where is he said I can't see the blind blind blind
[220:57.33]What the fuck happened?
[221:00.23]What happened?
[221:02.53]Why is he dead?
[221:04.35]What?
[221:05.34]Finally, it is returned to its rightful place.
[221:09.94]The stolen Hallibrand of the exalted noble.
[221:14.58]And now, I must bid you goodbye as well.
[221:18.83]Though I ask you deliver this message to the round table hold.
[221:23.77]I am Vian.
[221:27.39]Oh, we really fucked up here.
[221:31.45]Disturb not the death of Godwin, the exalted.
[221:35.78]You already killed him.
[221:36.48]We who humbly live in death live in waiting to one day welcome our lord.
[221:45.80]What right does anyone have to object?
[221:49.40]Our lord will rise.
[221:52.46]The lord of the many and the meek.
[222:05.69]Sorry, bro.
[222:10.47]Oh, man.
[222:14.37]Oh, we get to fucking... We get to... We get to... We get to take that drip.
[222:28.90]How good is that armor?
[222:37.52]Where is it?
[222:40.96]Oh my god, it's good.
[222:48.42]It's weird, though.
[222:49.22]I don't like it.
[222:49.72]Still medium load, right?
[222:59.22]Elm depicting entwined twins of gold and silver.
[223:03.64]Excuse me.
[223:05.49]The two known as D are inseparable twins.
[223:08.97]They are of two bodies and two minds, but one single soul.
[223:12.26]Not once do they stand together, and not one word do they speak to one another.
[223:16.18]Perhaps this armor long... Excuse me.
[223:22.15]Everybody said I was wrong.
[223:23.21]Everybody said that that was wrong, that that wasn't two people.
[223:36.91]It isn't two people.
[223:37.73]It is!
[223:42.13]Let's see how it looks.
[223:55.64]Still medium.
[224:02.10]Is that too weird?
[224:02.78]I don't like it.
[224:05.73]Eh, I don't like it.
[224:07.13]Eh, I don't think so.
[224:11.74]Eh, I don't think so.
[224:19.38]Wait.
[224:19.64]It's a little cooler now.
[224:27.20]I'm alright with this.
[224:31.45]That's weird.
[224:32.01]So now that lady's gone.
[224:33.54]Interesting.
[224:34.74]I don't know why he died.
[224:35.72]I don't know what killed him.
[224:45.04]You see what happened over there?
[224:45.98]Silent again.
[224:57.17]The spirits have escaped their confinement.
[225:00.35]Did you have anything to do with it, I wonder?
[225:03.85]Did I do something?
[225:06.27]I didn't do anything.
[225:08.09]And by the way, if anybody asks, me and Dee shop at the same store.
[225:14.57]If anybody asks, I just want to let you know.
[225:23.60]Oh, and by the way, he said he was taking a really long vacation.
[225:33.58]Alright, let's go.
[225:34.53]I want to go here.
[225:39.81]And I want to go here.
[225:44.41]Let's go.
[225:45.43]I'm ready.
[225:47.38]This is where we're going.
[225:48.50]This is what we're doing.
[225:49.80]And I will not hear a single complaint about it.
[225:53.22]I probably need to go on this one, right?
[225:57.66]No, we are very focused on going this way right now.
[226:01.33]We're very focused.
[226:03.21]In fact, we're incredibly focused on going here first.
[226:06.49]And here.
[226:08.59]And then we're going to round it out here.
[226:10.65]We're going to start here.
[226:11.59]We're going to do a little bit of exploration.
[226:19.99]You fucking dung eater.
[226:21.01]You didn't finish the sewer.
[226:25.74]It's fine.
[226:26.48]I'll be fine.
[226:27.94]I'll go back later.
[226:31.14]What is this?
[226:31.52]I gotta go back up.
[226:40.84]The spell that you will get does 21,000 damage.
[226:46.46]Okay.
[226:54.25]Okay.
[226:59.41]Irma only reads every other...
[227:02.92]It only reads every other sentence in the item descriptions.
[227:06.62]I also take every other step up a staircase as well.
[227:12.58]So, I mean, I kind of do that.
[227:25.11]I do every other step.
[227:26.41]I go two steps at a time.
[227:30.25]Alright.
[227:31.08]Who's this?
[227:37.44]Okay, two.
[227:37.80]We gotta go around.
[227:48.18]I gotta get up here.
[227:48.76]Yeah, this is a better one.
[227:55.80]What about downstairs?
[227:56.75]I mean, you can't really do downstairs.
[227:58.79]You'll trip and hurt yourself.
[228:02.53]And... What a stupid thing to say.
[228:10.67]Don't need any of this shit.
[228:19.41]Okay, we're going to two.
[228:21.55]No, we're not because I'm on a cliff.
[228:23.59]How do I get up there?
[228:29.17]I want to go look at this stuff.
[228:31.29]I need to get up here.
[228:32.09]Around here?
[228:42.54]I no longer give a shit about one.
[228:44.89]Because that's going to be like a memory stone.
[228:47.29]I don't care.
[228:48.65]That's going to be like a turtle puzzle with a memory stone in it.
[228:51.53]I don't want that.
[228:52.07]I don't care about that.
[228:57.08]We can go ahead and take that off the list.
[229:01.20]It was four.
[229:01.84]I don't care.
[229:05.78]Yeah, I'm not even using all the memory stone slots in the first place.
[229:11.31]Alright, now that's somewhere that I want to go.
[229:12.97]We'll go in there first.
[229:16.27]This looks like a church.
[229:16.93]Probably a sacred tier.
[229:19.68]Probably.
[229:22.28]Please don't die.
[229:27.18]Definitely.
[229:27.78]Nice.
[229:40.72]Sacred Tear, yeah!
[229:53.09]That's exactly what I wanted.
[229:59.23]I really needed it.
[230:01.85]Mog-related enemy, MonkaS.
[230:07.94]Mog related.
[230:10.18]The extended Mog family.
[230:27.20]What's going on down there?
[230:28.02]Okay.
[230:35.76]Uh, I do, I do want to go here.
[230:38.83]Fuck.
[230:47.11]Basically, any blood enemy is mog-like.
[230:54.88]I guess so.
[230:55.28]What's that?
[231:00.36]What's going on?
[231:05.64]What was that?
[231:06.10]Did you see that?
[231:07.35]That was weird.
[231:09.75]What was that weird like sprinklies?
[231:19.56]What's going on here?
[231:25.54]What was it?
[231:25.90]Did you see?
[231:26.27]You saw that?
[231:27.47]I don't know.
[231:27.79]What was that for?
[231:34.16]It was like a tube of sparklies.
[231:46.82]What's up?
[231:53.26]What's up?
[232:10.28]What's up?
[232:10.70]What's going on here?
[232:17.53]Okay.
[232:26.87]What is going on right now?
[232:33.25]Uh, okay.
[232:36.37]I think I just did something.
[232:41.72]Yeah, I got him.
[232:42.38]I got him.
[232:42.72]I don't know what that was for, necessarily, but... It's... It's... Okay, it's... You have to break the three seals and then the memory... It's gonna... Oh, I might as well just do it.
[233:01.35]Right.
[233:02.27]It's gonna be three seals.
[233:08.70]Okay, what the... What's going on?
[233:22.16]Get out of the tree.
[233:27.34]That's gonna instantly kill me if I'm not careful.
[233:38.99]Wig.
[233:42.59]Alright, so where's the other- There's two more seals probably right around here somewhere.
[233:51.41]There's a bonfire over here.
[233:57.55]Oh shit.
[233:58.01]Give me that.
[233:58.33]Get out.
[234:02.85]Get out.
[234:03.05]Get out.
[234:03.23]Get out.
[234:07.85]Alright.
[234:08.21]We're good.
[234:14.80]Sit down.
[234:15.32]Sit down.
[234:23.01]If I could go straight that way or... Where was the... It was that horse jump thing.
[234:36.88]I think I want to do that.
[234:38.72]That was over here somewhere, right?
[234:46.64]This puzzle is really bad.
[234:52.87]Yeah, this is two out of three.
[234:57.41]Touch three phant... Okay, this is Mirage Riddle.
[235:00.59]Touch three phantom.
[235:04.87]But this is two.
[235:05.25]This is the third one.
[235:10.27]Okay.
[235:11.31]Fix your hair.
[235:13.99]So there's one more, but...
[235:23.87]Me strong will take care of that one.
[235:41.85]Oh, well.
[235:45.07]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[235:47.21]There's another one.
[235:48.95]Should I go up again?
[235:53.74]Jesus.
[235:54.56]Okay, um... Where am I?
[236:02.58]Ah, alright.
[236:04.44]Hold on, there's like a thing over here.
[236:15.75]Ruins or something right here?
[236:22.47]You got a map, you dumbass.
[236:24.31]I know, I know.
[236:25.75]I just wanted to go to the other thing.
[236:27.97]You got a map, you dumbass.
[236:30.37]I know I have a map for it.
[236:32.57]I know.
[236:34.31]Me strong is gonna need some quests to do, okay?
[236:36.65]Me strong is not gonna get very many quests.
[236:39.82]So we're gonna give him some of these things that he would be interested in doing.
[236:52.57]There's one right in front of the tower.
[236:53.83]There's one right here.
[236:57.58]Right in front of it.
[236:58.50]No, right here.
[237:03.71]I already got the tower one.
[237:04.93]I did?
[237:14.20]There's one by the bridge.
[237:15.38]Okay, so that's the one by the crumbling bridge.
[237:17.94]Okay.
[237:19.20]Okay.
[237:19.98]It's over here.
[237:21.44]It's like right here somewhere.
[237:22.84]Alright?
[237:31.01]You got that one.
[237:33.69]You already got that one.
[237:34.77]So... It's not going away.
[237:39.65]Don't worry.
[237:40.49]Don't worry.
[237:45.84]Ooh, all right.
[237:46.64]Let's do this.
[237:47.06]Is this thing hostile?
[237:57.82]I guess.
[238:16.72]There's probably a dungeon here.
[238:18.50]That's pretty cool.
[238:20.70]Alright, looking for a dungeon.
[238:21.94]I'm not going to kill all these things.
[238:28.94]What about this way?
[238:32.56]That was the horror.
[238:33.59]It actually kind of looked like it, yeah.
[238:34.69]Alright, there's that.
[238:38.65]Hold on, let me see if there's anything around the corner.
[238:42.83]I'm a big fan of the dungeons.
[238:43.89]I love them.
[238:47.07]It's in there.
[238:47.49]Okay.
[239:04.43]Alright.
[239:05.81]I don't see anything else.
[239:11.03]Is it blood dogs?
[239:15.60]Oh shit, okay, we're just going for this.
[239:17.08]We're just going for it.
[239:18.22]Alright, let's go for it.
[239:18.98]We're going for it.
[239:19.71]Whatever's in here, let's do it.
[239:30.89]Sanguine Noble?
[239:37.75]Oh wow, you're gonna die very quickly.
[240:02.09]That was not a Mog-type enemy.
[240:14.27]Bloody Helus?
[240:16.71]There's some really cool weapons in this area.
[240:21.01]Arcane and Dex.
[240:23.79]It's a thrusting sword.
[240:24.83]Ooh, that's what he was using.
[240:29.35]Designed to bore into flesh, causing severe blood loss at the wound.
[240:33.82]The extracted blood trickles gracefully down the length of the blade.
[240:40.72]nimbly avoid an attack securing some distance from foes follow up with a strong attack to perform a sudden lunge and press strong attack again do it again this thing's really cool all right this is the only uh rapier that I would actually use in the game this is actually really cool does that have iframes
[241:11.21]Damn.
[241:14.41]That's really cool.
[241:20.18]Alright, so that's Arcane and Dex, which, I mean... Still got Babyrattle, but you know.
[241:26.18]It's good to see the other stuff.
[241:27.62]That's cool.
[241:28.10]That's fun.
[241:33.09]A weapon is being used for speedrunning.
[241:38.79]You know, after I finish this game, I definitely want to check out the speedruns because I'm really curious how you do it.
[241:45.83]Because you can go pretty much anywhere you want in the open world, right?
[241:50.14]You just get on the horse and just go.
[241:52.24]But do they just ride to the final boss somehow?
[241:55.46]There's a lot of warp skips.
[242:01.93]28 minutes currently.
[242:03.73]They use warps and then just run to the final boss.
[242:08.88]I'm so curious, eventually.
[242:10.24]Okay, that was cool.
[242:14.18]I can go this way.
[242:15.03]There's an all-remembrance run.
[242:22.88]That's probably cool, too.
[242:23.84]Alright, so here we go.
[242:24.56]We're on the road.
[242:38.17]Alright, so there was somebody here, right?
[242:40.01]There's a remembrance soul or something, right?
[242:44.40]Isn't that guy talking about it?
[242:45.30]Wow.
[242:53.88]You got a funny story?
[242:54.96]Let me tell you something.
[242:56.82]No.
[242:57.68]I don't.
[242:58.22]Not right now.
[243:01.49]Mount Gelmir.
[243:03.77]Very cool.
[243:07.61]Another one of these.
[243:20.02]What do I have?
[243:20.44]Plus, um... Plus 8.
[243:22.06]I'm imagining this is probably plus 10.
[243:25.54]Plus 15?
[243:26.16]Alright, let's take it in.
[243:29.62]Let's see what we got.
[243:33.30]Damn, this is a whole other area.
[243:34.58]This is an entire another zone, isn't it?
[243:37.74]What the fuck?
[243:42.21]Have you ever attempted a Soul Level 1 run?
[243:44.41]No.
[243:44.53]Oh, I don't have the skill to be able to do that.
[243:47.39]What's it fighting?
[243:58.75]Get a vantage point.
[244:00.92]Hi.
[244:24.81]These guys kind of suck I will help you fight it
[244:48.98]7-7-7.
[244:49.50]Alright, that's dead.
[244:57.98]Okay.
[245:08.60]What's been your favorite boss so far?
[245:11.84]You know, weirdly enough, I complained about him a lot.
[245:15.06]But it's probably Godric.
[245:18.51]You see, he had the most personality, I think.
[245:20.31]He had the best music.
[245:24.75]And the best personality so far.
[245:31.52]Alright, there's that.
[245:37.50]Why do you have the dunce cap on?
[245:38.70]Because it gives me extra intelligence and it doesn't make me look like a weirdo like the other one does.
[245:46.80]Progress.
[245:51.85]I don't have to kill these guys or anything, but... Worth at least looking around.
[246:05.68]Anything else on the edges?
[246:06.91]Always check the edges.
[246:08.57]Might be a dungeon.
[246:09.43]Awesome.
[246:16.29]Rodan lore is pretty cool.
[246:18.43]So, you guys are saying they patched him.
[246:21.83]What happened?
[246:30.33]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[246:33.85]Oh, my God.
[246:34.97]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[246:40.27]Holy shit.
[246:41.51]Why is it five people here?
[246:43.63]Three of them?
[246:53.05]So what did they do?
[246:53.65]He does way less damage now.
[246:56.93]Okay.
[247:06.09]I wonder how much less is way less.
[247:12.74]What was that ladder over here?
[247:16.72]Oh, my souls aren't on the ground, so I can't use that as a marker.
[247:21.76]It's like right here, right?
[247:31.53]Hurry up.
[247:34.49]Allegedly 40% less range on his swings.
[247:37.53]Holy shit.
[247:39.81]That's actually a huge deal.
[247:41.37]That's a big deal.
[247:44.82]If you beat him before the patch, you get bragging rights.
[247:46.90]I mean, I'll be honest.
[247:52.20]I kind of don't care about the bragging rights.
[247:54.68]I fucking hated that fight.
[247:58.06]Like, I almost wish I didn't fight it until post-patch, so I didn't, like, lose two years off of my life.
[248:12.33]He's a cool fight.
[248:13.05]He is a cool fight, but fuck that fight.
[248:22.31]Just wait.
[248:22.95]I, yeah, I know there's, like, another fight later or soon.
[248:27.57]That's like... Good luck.
[248:34.54]But I think I'm in a good... I'm in a good... I'm at level 100, right?
[248:37.68]That's a pretty good place to be.
[248:41.38]But most of the... Somewhere around like 120 to 130, 140 is kind of the end of the video game, in quotes.
[248:48.83]Something like that, right?
[248:57.48]150.
[248:59.82]Wait till 150, 150, 120.
[249:00.98]What's going on?
[249:02.96]Are you hostile?
[249:16.15]What are you doing?
[249:16.79]Stop.
[249:17.23]Don't do that.
[249:20.94]What?
[249:25.00]Okay, I'm sorry.
[249:25.84]It was like lying with your friend.
[249:27.64]I felt bad for that.
[249:29.62]I beat it around 135.
[249:30.39]135.
[249:34.09]I think most people are in like the 110 to 140 range from what I've heard.
[249:46.90]I don't want to go too, too far over level though, right?
[249:58.43]That's why, I mean, there's tons of stuff I could probably do and explore.
[250:01.39]I'm kind of afraid of just leveling up a ton.
[250:12.92]140 to 150 is average for late game.
[250:14.62]Okay, so I'm not concerned about it then.
[250:16.32]Alright, there's a whole other way to go down there.
[250:39.86]Those birds are going to come down, aren't they?
[250:42.40]Yeah, they are.
[250:44.06]Yes, they are.
[250:44.60]I don't even know what they're doing.
[250:49.90]They're like starting a fire, but some guy just rides in a horseback and kills everybody in one swing.
[251:00.98]A couple of smithing stones.
[251:04.32]They're eating each other.
[251:06.99]Oh, what the?
[251:07.85]He's eating.
[251:08.43]He was eating.
[251:09.25]They were eating each other.
[251:11.23]That's terrifying.
[251:18.28]Oh, they are.
[251:19.32]You guys, they're eating each other.
[251:33.60]Did I really just say, hey, guys, look, they're eating each other.
[251:35.84]Guys, they're eating each other.
[251:37.14]You can't see.
[251:37.88]I guess I need to describe that to you for some reason.
[251:41.60]I don't know.
[251:41.96]I don't know why.
[251:52.47]Oh, my God.
[251:53.27]Where did you come from?
[251:58.01]These guys don't climb, right?
[252:01.20]I don't think so.
[252:04.58]I really- No, they don't.
[252:07.34]You climb?
[252:07.84]How come you're swinging around a cat toy?
[252:24.88]No, yeah, sorry.
[252:26.43]Not gonna happen.
[252:28.97]Get on here so I can punch you, like, in the back.
[252:31.25]I'm gonna punch you in the spine as hard as I can.
[252:33.09]Come on.
[252:37.43]Get down here.
[252:38.10]I'm not gonna let you fuck this up for me.
[252:41.12]Get down.
[252:41.54]Alright.
[252:45.80]Just kick him in the fucking head.
[252:57.13]Oh my fucking god.
[252:58.95]You little shi- I'm bouncing off the fucking wall.
[253:05.39]What the fuck?
[253:09.87]How are you still alive?
[253:14.73]Oh.
[253:15.25]My.
[253:16.17]God.
[253:16.73]Dude.
[253:19.38]This is the sloppiest fucking thing.
[253:22.00]How sloppy is this?
[253:33.61]Why can't he not hurt him?
[253:35.75]Oh my fucking god!
[253:40.33]Just run!
[253:47.10]Alright, they all came down.
[253:53.86]Wait, get out of here!
[253:59.05]Push him, push him, push him.
[254:00.79]Push him off.
[254:07.32]Dude, why can I not... He's dead!
[254:20.66]This is the stupidest thing I've ever done.
[254:22.78]So, I'm telling you, I'm serious.
[254:25.77]Let's just go ahead and take care of this now.
[254:27.67]I didn't even want to... I'm just trying to rush so... Okay, I'm fucking actually getting...
[254:49.99]You know what?
[254:50.43]Just eat shit, dude.
[254:52.21]Seriously.
[255:09.70]I got his head.
[255:10.42]Okay.
[255:10.96]Pumpkin head.
[255:12.22]Very cool.
[255:14.06]You can fuck your... You can... Yeah.
[255:16.16]Yeah.
[255:18.73]Go fuck yourself.
[255:20.21]Yeah.
[255:22.49]See you later.
[255:23.01]I'm not putting that up.
[255:31.16]Elden Ring is easy.
[255:32.16]Slide down the ladder?
[255:35.96]What?
[255:41.64]If there's any more clowns up here.
[255:48.69]I could hear those mouth noises.
[255:54.19]Alright, so what was even up here?
[256:04.63]A bow!
[256:05.49]A bow and arrow!
[256:06.81]Hooray!
[256:09.29]Nice!
[256:11.15]A bow made out of string and like... fucking like hamburger meat.
[256:16.53]What was that?
[256:18.83]This thing is made out of... This is a toy.
[256:21.82]Pulley bow.
[256:25.46]Pulley's in springs.
[256:32.28]That's kind of cool, though.
[256:36.24]There's a summoning sign right there.
[256:37.40]That's the best bow?
[256:46.64]Is it actually the best bow in the game?
[256:49.54]I can make this jump, right?
[256:50.86]Yeah.
[256:51.84]I mean, of course I can.
[256:52.64]I fell off it like fucking ten times.
[256:54.14]Alright, let's go.
[257:07.49]Is that an Erd tree?
[257:10.74]Or that used to be an Erd tree or something, right?
[257:12.58]Look at that.
[257:12.96]That shit's burnt.
[257:19.82]That's an urn tree!
[257:20.91]That shit's all burnt!
[257:22.43]Look!
[257:23.59]Look!
[257:30.77]Why are these here?
[257:31.25]How come these stones are here?
[257:37.41]Oh, he's putting stones down.
[258:03.80]Shut up!
[258:17.03]What do we have here?
[258:27.13]What do we have here?
[258:37.45]What is... Will you leave me the fuck alone?
[258:40.23]I don't... He's gonna fall the whole way, I guarantee it.
[258:54.87]He's gonna sit here.
[259:07.75]Aww, damn it.
[259:11.36]I thought it was gonna be like, choom!
[259:19.12]Gelmer Hero's Grave.
[259:20.89]The beast eye quivers, does it?
[259:28.37]God Watchers skip.
[259:29.65]What is this, hard?
[259:31.39]This place is ass.
[259:32.62]No, no, no, not this place.
[259:37.88]You're saying this place is ass?
[259:38.78]We'll find out.
[259:46.06]Good luck with this.
[259:47.16]I think I'm good to go.
[259:48.44]I'm pretty leveled.
[259:49.94]I'm in a good spot.
[259:50.82]I've got a lot of health.
[259:55.16]Whatever it's going to throw my way is... This is really spooky.
[259:58.76]Minecraft.
[260:03.75]Minecraft.
[260:11.47]Yeah, I see it!
[260:13.35]How far does it go?
[260:22.32]Oh, what?!
[260:34.69]It goes that far, okay.
[260:38.66]I hate this stupid shit.
[260:40.93]I fucking hate these things.
[260:44.35]You're gonna need more matcha for this one.
[260:46.13]I hate these.
[260:49.05]It's just the perfect timing.
[260:51.31]I gotta hide in there.
[260:53.03]Or can I just get to some- Let me just get into this little nook over here.
[261:05.40]Where- It didn't hit either one of them.
[261:12.35]Thank you.
[261:24.91]Where's the archer?
[261:25.75]Who's got the bow?
[261:32.88]Oh, shit.
[261:43.30]Stay dead.
[261:47.03]You need to spend these souls now because you ain't getting them back.
[261:51.90]He went all the way up!
[262:26.18]Oh, get out of the way, you fucking tarnished.
[262:44.45]Okay, here we go.
[262:45.40]It stops here and then keeps going.
[263:10.92]Oh, he went in the flame.
[263:11.76]Okay, he's fine.
[263:15.52]It goes all the way down.
[263:16.72]Okay, should I go...
[263:20.86]I go when it goes up here.
[263:21.72]Let's see.
[263:22.58]One.
[263:23.24]Two.
[263:25.22]Three.
[263:26.33]Four.
[263:27.59]Five.
[263:27.93]And then we go now.
[263:30.91]Go back, go back, go back.
[263:31.61]I hesitated a second.
[263:32.38]Go back.
[263:34.82]Going for right there.
[263:53.65]Why do you idiots have to be in every single one of these?
[263:56.41]Alright, then we're going... I'm gonna jump to that.
[263:58.71]This is probably an instant kill if you go in the lava.
[264:03.56]I... Okay, follow it down.
[264:05.64]Maybe?
[264:05.92]Let's see.
[264:10.08]One.
[264:10.20]Two.
[264:11.98]Three.
[264:12.96]Four.
[264:13.95]Five.
[264:14.91]Six.
[264:15.89]Seven.
[264:16.11]Yeah, it's enough time.
[264:22.90]Here we go.
[264:32.67]Ooh, here we are.
[264:33.27]Alright, but wait.
[264:35.03]Is there any more?
[264:37.37]There is.
[264:37.75]Oh, fuck.
[264:44.14]Oh, fuck.
[264:44.56]Oh, fuck.
[264:44.96]Oh, fuck.
[265:00.01]Ah!
[265:01.09]You go so slow!
[265:03.02]Um, what?
[265:07.28]It's gonna keep going!
[265:25.49]Where is it?
[265:27.90]Does it come back?
[265:29.70]I don't know.
[265:30.06]Does it come down here?
[265:30.72]I actually don't know if it comes down here or not.
[265:41.27]Oh my god, it does.
[265:42.31]No, it doesn't.
[265:42.69]Okay, go!
[265:57.60]Oh my god, you fucking assholes!
[266:03.20]That's safe, actually.
[266:31.39]Fuck!
[266:51.09]How the fuck am I gonna do this?
[266:58.65]The door?
[266:59.13]Isn't that a door that needs... That door doesn't open.
[267:03.41]Is it locked by a contraption, right?
[267:04.99]Like all the other doors in every dungeon?
[267:08.75]What?
[267:10.07]What are you talking about?
[267:10.89]There's no lever for this fight?
[267:14.76]Oh, shit.
[267:18.14]Oh, shit.
[267:23.76]There's a statue right here.
[267:25.06]Oh, boy.
[267:25.72]Oh, boy.
[267:26.48]Say goodbye to these souls.
[267:27.36]They're gone.
[267:36.01]Use a dagger with quick step.
[267:37.39]That's actually a pretty good idea.
[267:38.37]Alright, what is it?
[267:40.99]I wonder if I'm leveled enough to kill this pretty easily.
[267:43.70]Let's find out.
[267:44.10]Okay.
[267:46.96]Red.
[267:47.30]It's one of these wolves.
[267:48.36]I can handle it.
[267:48.80]Okay.
[268:07.03]So,
[268:42.92]Oh!
[268:43.08]This game's fucking easy.
[268:49.96]Bloodhound, Knight, Flow?
[268:51.70]That was a lot of souls for that.
[268:59.64]Actually, was it that...
[269:04.00]It's a legendary summon.
[269:09.94]Death root.
[269:10.90]Ooh, okay.
[269:13.67]So, whoa.
[269:14.89]Alright.
[269:16.11]You skipped half the dungeon.
[269:18.01]You need to stop making wolf noises.
[269:22.25]You took a secret route I didn't even know about.
[269:23.85]This dungeon was much longer.
[269:26.01]You missed half the dungeon.
[269:28.27]Now do the dungeon now.
[269:29.37]Keep exploring.
[269:30.15]But I don't... Fuck this place.
[269:36.00]I've never seen somebody run past this entire dungeon before.
[269:39.79]Really?
[269:40.05]I just wanted to get it over with as fast as possible.
[269:43.29]I hate those things.
[269:46.61]Fuck the rest of the whole dungeon.
[269:47.71]None of it actually helps your build at all.
[269:51.31]I'll give it a glance.
[269:53.11]I'll give it a glance.
[270:05.88]That was cool, though.
[270:10.03]I'm doing such an ungodly amount of damage.
[270:12.03]Is this cool armor in here?
[270:20.71]Just skip it.
[270:21.15]The place sucks.
[270:22.88]Eh, whatever.
[270:23.22]Fuck it.
[270:24.68]Me strong will come clean that place up.
[270:27.40]That was cool, though.
[270:32.46]Ooh, there we are.
[270:33.96]That's what I want right there.
[270:38.99]Okay, number four.
[270:43.23]No, everyone thought I was going to do it.
[270:56.29]I'm really curious about this burnt erd tree.
[271:01.29]I'm going to go check that out right now.
[271:04.43]There's a legendary hilarious weapon down there.
[271:09.16]Alright, these are here.
[271:10.38]Why are these here?
[271:13.04]All these little stones.
[271:14.06]What do they do?
[271:14.48]Why are they here?
[271:24.61]It's a summoning thing.
[271:27.19]Read message.
[271:27.91]Hold on.
[271:28.29]Wait, I have to deal with some asshole for a second.
[271:46.35]Bro, you got 800 damage on that.
[271:50.67]Follow the stones.
[271:54.27]What does the message say?
[271:56.35]Rainbow stones lead the way to riches.
[272:02.88]It's gonna be patches.
[272:24.77]Oh my god, I'm slipping off.
[272:29.59]I don't see any more.
[272:30.27]I don't get it.
[272:53.60]Well, if you really are that gullible... Why is he such a dick?
[273:11.30]Then stay away from the volcano manor!
[273:20.15]What's his problem?
[273:25.05]I don't get it.
[273:31.46]Why is Patches such a piece of shit?
[273:34.26]Like, he's not even chaotic evil.
[273:36.62]He's not even chaotic neutral.
[273:38.62]He's just like... I don't even know what you even describe him as.
[273:44.43]He's just annoying.
[273:47.59]You know what I mean?
[273:48.01]Like, oh, where are you on that, like, chart?
[273:51.17]Just annoying.
[273:54.67]Sometimes he's friend, sometimes he's foe.
[273:57.01]But he's not even, like, I guess he just does whatever he wants whenever he feels like it.
[274:02.94]I'm chaotic good.
[274:03.86]Yeah.
[274:04.06]That's what everybody says.
[274:09.30]Nobody wants to be, like, lawful good, right?
[274:11.38]Because that's not cool.
[274:14.54]No, I'm chaotic neutral.
[274:17.42]I do whatever I want.
[274:18.20]I do what I want.
[274:19.48]And sometimes I'm good.
[274:20.78]Sometimes I'm fucking instantly dying with 60,000 health.
[274:23.02]I don't even know where I am.
[274:34.45]No, I'm good.
[274:35.67]Chaotic good is just like, I'm good, but keep an eye on me.
[274:48.94]They're gone forever.
[274:52.96]Oh, no.
[274:56.40]You literally can't get back down there.
[274:58.66]Why not?
[275:06.62]I'll just kick him.
[275:07.70]He can just kick me off again.
[275:14.67]He'll just boot me off again.
[275:18.74]I can't believe you fell for it twice.
[275:20.42]Chaota Good is the second most cringe alignment.
[275:33.14]Lawful Good is the first.
[275:35.26]Why do you say that?
[275:39.19]Why?
[275:39.35]Is it because Lawful Good is like, I'm a good person?
[275:43.01]And I follow all the rules and I'm a good boy?
[275:45.33]And I- Oh, chaotic.
[275:48.25]Evil.
[275:49.13]No, I'm good and I play by all the rules.
[275:51.67]Boy Scout Andy.
[275:55.35]Well, then what's not cringe?
[275:56.85]Okay?
[275:57.27]Which one of them isn't cringe?
[275:59.97]Neutral cringe.
[276:01.31]Pick a side, loser.
[276:03.29]Okay?
[276:05.23]Neutral good.
[276:06.05]You don't do enough.
[276:08.99]Um, okay.
[276:13.85]What else is there?
[276:16.66]True neutral.
[276:25.20]Neutral evil.
[276:26.02]Okay, you do bad shit, but you're not in the bad boys club.
[276:31.05]No.
[276:34.94]You're not, you're not like bad enough to be on the villain team.
[276:37.99]You're just like, they, they like hear about you sometimes.
[276:39.79]Oh, cringe.
[276:50.53]Chaotic evil.
[276:52.03]Oh yeah, you're crazy.
[276:53.13]Cringe.
[276:59.62]Like, there, uh, what, which one, which one do I get to be?
[277:05.89]Chaotic cringe.
[277:09.53]Can I actually not get back down there?
[277:11.19]I don't see the stones anymore.
[277:19.51]Cringe good.
[277:20.66]Cringe evil.
[277:26.84]You know, I feel like I've seen like TikToks of what I would describe as like cringe good and like cringe evil.
[277:33.10]You know what I mean?
[277:36.49]Cringe neutral.
[277:39.65]Chaotic cringe.
[277:44.19]Oh, shit.
[278:06.48]Oh my god, you're gonna kill me and I'm gonna have to run all the way back here.
[278:13.74]Your body is so weird.
[278:15.20]I don't even know when you're swinging and when you're not swinging.
[278:20.48]Oh, fuck you.
[278:35.35]Oh, fuck.
[278:42.43]Swing!
[278:43.25]Why didn't I swing?
[278:44.11]I just jumped.
[278:44.83]Oh my god.
[278:56.41]Chaotic, neutral, evil.
[278:59.35]Yeah, chaotic, neutral, but then in parentheses, evil.
[279:12.74]Scavenger's Curve Sword.
[279:17.65]Yeah, I talked about, yeah, Ball of Yarn, Chef.
[279:19.85]Where's Flamin' Hot Cheetos on that list, right?
[279:24.49]Didn't you see, like, the Joker with, like, a fucking Flamin' Hot Cheeto fingers?
[279:29.69]Like, doing that, like, big smile.
[279:32.27]And he's, like, holding the bag up.
[279:34.61]That's super chaotic evil.
[279:37.21]How have they not done, like, a tie-in with the Joker?
[279:44.85]Like, Flamin' Hot Cheetos, they're crazy like me, right?
[279:47.91]How come they, why have they not done that?
[279:49.23]That feels like they would do that.
[280:01.11]Yeah, make him green.
[280:02.63]Make him a green Flamin' Hot Cheetos.
[280:04.59]And it's like, oh yeah, this is like, it's like the Joker.
[280:08.53]He's like crazy and like spicy and my mouth like hurts and everything.
[280:11.29]It's crazy.
[280:12.29]That's the, oh, the Joker version.
[280:14.25]It's green.
[280:17.89]Don't tell me I'm wrong because like that, I, please.
[280:20.61]Guys, they already do blue Takis, okay?
[280:27.59]They are one step away.
[280:53.72]You didn't think you'd be dealing with some of that was level 100 Sorry
[281:03.60]Not happening today.
[281:18.78]Green Takis.
[281:21.08]Only available at Walmart.
[281:24.44]Eat like the Joker.
[281:37.08]That wasn't- that was a leprechaun?
[281:38.34]Fuck.
[281:46.24]I have to hide whenever I do something stupid.
[281:51.82]Oh, have a St.
[281:53.30]Patrick's Day.
[281:54.42]Yeah, it wouldn't- it would be just like, it would be, uh, whatever.
[282:04.61]Oh, that was that actually like Irish?
[282:08.53]It wasn't, right?
[282:13.61]No, that was the Joker.
[282:16.47]I'm trying to listen to the Joker talk and a leprechaun talk, and they're the same voice in my head.
[282:23.37]Oh, what do you mean?
[282:27.11]Oh, yeah, Batman, it seems that you have been caught into my trap.
[282:34.65]I can't.
[282:35.99]They talk the same.
[282:38.98]No, not Mark Hamill's Joker.
[282:40.68]Do they talk the same?
[282:44.98]Why are you doing Charlie Day?
[282:53.37]Charlie Day would probably be a pretty good Joker.
[282:56.31]He could be.
[283:05.57]Watch out!
[283:10.11]By the way, Takis are fucking disgusting, but let me tell you something.
[283:21.46]I have a confession to make.
[283:23.52]I have been eating off-brand Takis, and I think they're incredible.
[283:32.72]I think Takis are dog shit.
[283:35.64]But the off-brand Takis that are not Takis are amazing to me.
[283:42.17]Trader Joe's makes an unbelievable Takis ripoff, and they're way better.
[283:47.25]Honestly, the Doritos ones.
[283:49.09]The Doritos ones, just a straight-up copy of Takis, I think are better.
[283:54.21]But I'm serious.
[283:55.07]The Trader Joe's ones are the way that they should be.
[284:07.69]That's usually true.
[284:08.87]Yeah, I'm saying, I'm telling you, if you, like, love Takis, first of all, cringe.
[284:14.80]Welcome, dear customer.
[284:17.70]Yes, right this way.
[284:19.68]Right this way.
[284:25.24]I'm about to falling R1 this guy.
[284:31.12]I'm just kidding.
[284:33.82]Welcome, valued customer.
[284:37.83]Come trade in our wandering emporium, please.
[284:42.60]I'm hungry.
[284:44.34]I've been hungry so long.
[284:47.22]Ouch!
[284:48.32]Please.
[284:53.36]Confessor.
[284:54.04]This is what the confessor.
[284:54.92]Oh.
[284:57.04]Man, your inventory is kind of bad, man.
[285:00.68]Only got one stone sword spilling stone key.
[285:03.48]Come on.
[285:05.50]I'll buy this, I guess.
[285:06.36]I don't know if that does.
[285:07.86]Volcano pot and roped volcano pot.
[285:10.20]Cool.
[285:17.12]This area is really cool, actually.
[285:22.46]I really wish I could see anything.
[285:26.58]Is that... I like the scale.
[285:29.40]Very cool.
[285:35.04]going up.
[285:35.58]I'm just looking at the view.
[285:37.56]This game comes out like once a decade a game comes out like this.
[285:41.58]I'm going to take a second and take the binoculars and I'm going to look at the view.
[285:49.31]You know what I wanted to kind of do?
[285:50.33]Okay, if I set up a poll and everybody picked what they thought they were for like the chaotic good, neutral good, neutral evil, right?
[286:00.35]I'm very curious what the makeup of this audience is.
[286:05.44]Aren't you?
[286:05.74]I'm very curious.
[286:17.43]This keeps going.
[286:20.79]Should I do it?
[286:22.69]Maybe I'll do it in a minute.
[286:25.43]Oh, I hate these guys.
[286:27.51]The lightning.
[286:28.43]Wow.
[286:36.18]I didn't think you were fucking with over-leveled Andy.
[286:50.96]Stop saying Andy.
[286:52.36]You did this to me.
[286:53.14]You guys ruined it.
[286:53.98]You ruined me.
[286:54.98]You ruined me.
[286:56.74]I never said this shit.
[286:58.38]Ever.
[287:00.04]This was never a phrase that exited my mouth until like 2019.
[287:04.26]2020.
[287:04.32]You guys were saying it all the time.
[287:09.78]So I was like, oh, that's kind of fun.
[287:11.76]Something Andy.
[287:12.35]That's funny.
[287:12.89]I guess.
[287:13.25]Cool.
[287:16.19]You guys said it so much that I got into it.
[287:20.97]Whoa.
[287:21.39]What does it say?
[287:27.25]The assault on Volcano Manor.
[287:29.72]The squalid, the sick, the blasphemous.
[287:32.14]A wretched, unending war with no glory.
[287:40.14]Ooh, there's one of those.
[287:43.28]I'm gonna go get it.
[287:45.24]Yes, I am.
[287:55.84]If one of these bridges is gonna- something crazy is gonna happen.
[287:57.76]It's gonna fall.
[288:02.42]Ooh.
[288:21.03]Is- is this like a- is this a tortoise versus the hare scenario?
[288:24.86]Or I could just skip the ladder.
[288:28.28]But I feel like this is a tortoise and the hare scenario.
[288:30.90]I'm not going to do it.
[288:47.38]What happened to all your runes?
[288:49.40]Patches kicked me off the cliff and everybody laughed.
[288:52.92]And I, like, threatened to turn my scream off a few times.
[288:57.09]Because it was, like, almost 100,000 souls I lost.
[288:59.15]I calmed down, though.
[289:02.97]Alright, so.
[289:04.31]Yeah, this is tortoise versus the hare.
[289:05.55]That's like, oh, let me go up really fast.
[289:06.97]But if you go up too fast, maybe somebody shoots you out of the air with an arrow.
[289:12.07]There's no way they would put these right next to each other without it being like, I'm lazy and I'm going to skip content.
[289:24.28]This is gonna be the correct path.
[289:37.48]Old grown... I didn't get to read his name.
[289:52.21]Why would you put a ladder there?
[289:55.37]It's the same thing.
[290:00.22]So, wait a minute.
[290:09.65]Is FromSoftware anticipating that you don't have the horse?
[290:14.27]Like, what the fuck?
[290:18.59]Alright, I'm staying.
[290:19.33]I'm getting off the horse.
[290:28.11]All right, he goes click click click click click click click Is this an on horse fight or off horse fight I wonder Oh All right, you just gotta dodge away from it
[291:01.95]Oh shit Still hit me?
[291:29.05]Don't get hit.
[291:29.43]Oh, this is bad.
[291:31.36]This is not that bad.
[291:57.27]Ah, shit!
[291:57.91]He turns around.
[292:06.49]Thought he was gonna go for it.
[292:10.24]Alright.
[292:15.54]Oh, that's bad.
[292:16.04]I'm dead.
[292:35.19]That hurts him a lot, but it takes way too long.
[292:40.68]How many fucking times are you gonna do that move? ...
[293:01.09]He takes damage from that a lot.
[293:03.48]Wow, that's way better than actually attacking this guy.
[293:07.78]Oh, hey!
[293:08.26]Oh!
[293:30.07]Oh shit, too cocky.
[293:34.80]Oh, I'm fucking dead here.
[293:36.80]Oh my god, his fucking moves.
[293:53.47]That is a disgusting amount of damage.
[294:02.83]I think this is an on-horse fight.
[294:04.07]I really do.
[294:04.55]Let's see if I can do it.
[294:10.02]Oh, that's bad.
[294:10.54]I'm dead.
[294:19.40]Ah!
[294:19.56]I thought I had... I thought I had the poison things that I could eat.
[294:36.83]It's alright.
[294:43.49]I'm gonna stay on the horse.
[294:44.17]Yeah, there's no reason to get off the horse.
[294:49.34]You know that you can dodge when on the horse?
[294:50.68]I'm gonna turn purple in just a few fucking minutes.
[295:02.82]Get the fuck outta here, man.
[295:13.18]Yeah, you can stay on the horse.
[295:14.46]It really is.
[295:17.56]This is a non-issue on the horse.
[295:31.39]Oh, please!
[296:03.56]Oh
[296:20.36]Oh, what?
[296:39.49]I thought he was done with his move.
[296:46.24]Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.
[296:52.04]This fucking menu, I swear to God.
[297:06.35]Fucking Mario 64.
[297:22.86]Thank you.
[297:51.50]Thank you.
[298:26.74]Not the move I wanted to do, but it's alright.
[298:47.80]He's dead, he's dead, he's dead.
[298:55.26]cocky little shit I swear to god this is not a problem I'm fine all right that was not bad that wasn't bad hey that was a cool fight I got him oh
[299:21.13]Two... I got two Smithing Stones.
[299:23.77]And then Falling Star Beast Jaw.
[299:26.31]What is that?
[299:33.15]Colossal Weapon?
[299:35.47]Strength, Int, and Dex.
[299:40.18]Hard and shining black fashioned into a weapon.
[299:42.44]With its sharp point, this colossal weapon can skewer foes.
[299:49.96]Wow.
[299:53.41]20k, but 60k gone.
[299:54.79]Yeah.
[300:00.03]Can I do the move?
[300:05.62]Oh.
[300:07.10]This thing is wild looking.
[300:09.38]Damn.
[300:12.48]Alright.
[300:14.20]Very cool.
[300:16.36]Well, maybe a strengthened int build or kind of all over the place.
[300:20.12]Yeah.
[300:20.76]Strengthened int.
[300:23.70]Um, that's cool.
[300:26.16]That matches your stupid hat.
[300:27.62]Yeah, but I can't use it.
[300:28.44]All right.
[300:30.10]So anything else here that I, anything else?
[300:35.15]That was pretty fun.
[300:41.61]There's, I would consider that to be a manor and I would consider that to be volcano fluid in the manor.
[300:48.46]So I'm imagining that's where I need to go.
[300:53.71]Can I just jump from here?
[300:58.59]No way.
[301:00.85]I need to go that way.
[301:05.15]We gotta go down and then around.
[301:06.82]Okay.
[301:06.92]Got it.
[301:09.96]Don't.
[301:10.24]Go right ahead.
[301:10.80]Don't.
[301:11.06]Don't.
[301:11.24]I'm not gonna do it.
[301:13.78]Wait.
[301:14.02]Maybe I will.
[301:16.52]Oh, wow.
[301:17.14]Yeah.
[301:17.48]I am gonna do that.
[301:18.48]This is here for a reason.
[301:19.32]Look.
[301:21.16]Look at that.
[301:23.10]Perfect.
[301:23.72]Very cool.
[301:24.78]VERY cool.
[301:25.70]This is a cool game.
[301:48.06]Alright, so let's turn the corner here.
[301:52.58]Oh, give me that.
[301:53.44]Please.
[301:54.00]I don't want to do anything else until I get this.
[301:56.08]Oh!
[301:56.24]There's an invisible cookie bug right here.
[302:01.43]Don't be an idiot.
[302:18.36]Uh, there's another little erd tree seed.
[302:24.34]There's a pouch menu.
[302:25.36]Yeah, I'm using it for the boys.
[302:26.51]Alright, where is this thing?
[302:33.48]Excuse me, frame rate.
[302:34.32]What's going on here?
[302:59.32]Fine, I'll wait for him.
[303:08.53]He circles right here.
[303:14.59]He circles the rug.
[303:18.79]Fucking Elmer Fudd.
[303:25.36]I gotta pee again.
[303:26.16]Hurry up.
[303:47.86]Ruin through Ash of War.
[303:49.54]Cool.
[303:55.91]Now there's Volcano Mana.
[304:02.89]Alright, there's a scary guy up front.
[304:08.12]Where is the fucking map fragment?
[304:11.00]It's down there.
[304:15.62]I'm getting the map fragment first.
[304:18.29]We're not going in the front door without it.
[304:19.57]I thought I died.
[304:29.55]Why does this particular area run like such ass?
[304:37.08]No, I don't want to fight these.
[304:39.10]Is this a hand zone?
[304:41.22]This is a hand zone.
[304:43.05]I don't want to be... Can I skip this?
[304:45.45]Do I have to be here?
[304:59.35]Okay, I have to be... I'm just... I don't want to piss so much.
[305:03.88]I'll be right back.
[308:38.70]Thank you.
[313:41.03]I am not kidding.
[313:44.07]That was insane.
[313:47.41]I've never had that experience before in my entire life.
[313:50.28]In my entire life.
[313:53.60]I went to go pee.
[313:55.24]I did a full 30 to 40 second full piss.
[313:59.98]I was done.
[314:00.66]That's it.
[314:02.50]Okay.
[314:03.32]Grab a water.
[314:04.56]Come back over here.
[314:07.02]I got the urge to go again.
[314:09.83]I peed a second full time.
[314:11.91]Like a full 10 to 20 seconds.
[314:14.39]Again.
[314:14.57]And then... It happened.
[314:21.32]I went to go sit in here and it was like, I have to go pee again.
[314:27.02]What happened?
[314:31.08]That was three full pisses.
[314:36.05]I am not fucking making this up.
[314:38.95]Do we UTI?
[314:39.91]I don't know.
[314:42.77]I don't think so.
[314:43.55]There was just a lot of volume.
[314:45.83]Like a ton of volume.
[314:48.61]Cranberry juice.
[314:49.41]I love- I drink cranberry juice.
[314:51.23]Not that cocktail bullshit.
[314:53.15]I drink cranberry juice real.
[314:55.59]I don't have a UTI.
[314:57.92]Stop.
[314:58.22]I don't have a UTI.
[315:04.37]Oh, alignment pole.
[315:05.31]Cool.
[315:05.67]Alright, so let's see.
[315:09.06]We've got, uh... I'm very curious.
[315:17.26]Neutral good.
[315:18.86]Chaotic neutral, chaotic good.
[315:20.72]I'm gonna, okay, yeah.
[315:23.26]Bullshit.
[315:26.37]I knew that chaotic good was gonna be up here.
[315:28.37]Hi.
[315:30.62]What is, okay, honestly, what is neutral evil even supposed to mean?
[315:35.19]Right?
[315:37.51]I don't, like, what is neutral evil supposed to be?
[315:39.67]Oh, god damn it.
[315:46.03]I just, like, broke my god damn game.
[315:48.07]Please don't tell me.
[315:48.67]Please, please, please, please, please, please.
[315:50.75]Please!
[315:52.39]Okay, that's better.
[315:58.59]You're just an asshole, but you're not evil.
[316:01.30]Yeah, like, you're just, like, kind of a dick?
[316:06.58]You're an asshole, but you don't know you're an asshole.
[316:11.27]Okay, interestingly enough... Chaotic Good is up there, right?
[316:14.43]Yeah, that's what I would assume.
[316:19.49]All right, so I got this map now.
[316:21.97]Which is... This is crazy that there's even another area, too.
[316:26.14]All right.
[316:28.17]Look at all this shit to do.
[316:29.65]Look at all this, look at all this stuff.
[316:31.07]You can't, no, you can't even do it in one lifetime.
[316:35.50]That's where I died.
[316:36.40]This is where I am now.
[316:37.56]Alright, so.
[316:38.48]Look, there's like shit over here to explore.
[316:40.12]Runes and... Alright.
[316:45.72]Horse in pouch.
[316:49.27]Bro.
[316:49.45]Huh?
[316:51.41]Huh?
[317:10.31]I'm actually kind of surprised that it took me this long to do that.
[317:16.79]I think that's all I need.
[317:17.51]Look at all these ruins too.
[317:18.79]I'm not crushing any of them.
[317:24.27]Alright.
[317:24.53]Finally.
[317:24.95]It only took 80 in-game hours.
[317:28.88]Now let's start the process.
[317:30.24]I went this way.
[317:31.12]I want to go... There's probably a side door.
[317:33.86]Let's do side entrance.
[317:35.10]We're going to do side entrance.
[317:46.56]Probably side entrance.
[317:52.99]I don't even need to fight these guys.
[317:56.59]Fuck them.
[317:58.95]Ooh, yikes.
[318:02.22]No side entrance?
[318:07.86]What's down here?
[318:11.77]This guy is huge!
[318:15.97]Oh, man!
[318:16.59]He's like a giant one of these things!
[318:27.29]Oh, don't... You know what?
[318:28.74]We're gonna go ahead and do this.
[318:40.64]Whoa!
[318:41.82]That was weird!
[318:42.66]He just went so fast!
[318:47.19]All right, that was pretty fun.
[319:09.32]A larval tear, oh.
[319:16.57]Oh, this is the burnt Erd tree.
[319:21.21]This is really interesting.
[319:22.07]I wonder why this is like this.
[319:22.97]What the heck?
[319:27.23]I'm getting immersed.
[319:37.29]One of these guys is down here?
[320:08.93]Oh, fuck you.
[320:13.53]Oh!
[320:17.99]What?
[320:23.93]Don't get cocky, you idiot!
[321:00.42]Fuck you, I hit him.
[321:13.85]What is going on?
[321:15.32]What did he just do?
[321:17.26]Why did he do that?
[321:37.66]Oh, shit!
[321:38.30]My fucking pants!
[321:39.84]I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[321:40.88]I got plenty of health.
[321:52.27]Get out of here.
[321:58.25]I have enough experience fighting those guys.
[321:59.91]That's like the fourth one I've fought.
[322:02.64]Ooh.
[322:06.90]Ledin and... What do those do?
[322:12.88]Eliminates all FP consumption.
[322:22.12]I drink that and can just spam spells?
[322:29.20]Really?
[322:31.47]I kind of feel like I need that.
[322:32.45]That seems unbelievably... That seems... Like game-breaking how good that is.
[322:48.46]That's God tier?
[322:49.34]You can summon any spirit for free.
[322:55.95]Jesus.
[322:58.81]Okay.
[322:59.75]That's cool.
[323:09.61]I think behind the Erd tree.
[323:17.90]Oh, that was pretty cool though.
[323:22.45]I will say I've fought that worm spirit ulcerated tree sap thing like five times though.
[323:30.39]I have lots of experience.
[323:31.61]And where are we going?
[323:32.33]I'm heading this way now.
[323:37.45]I don't know what this is.
[323:43.99]What happened here?
[323:49.01]Is that the manor?
[323:49.79]I think... I would say this is the volcano manor.
[323:57.95]I'm gonna... Yeah.
[323:59.37]I wanna do the manor.
[324:02.55]Saw the front door.
[324:03.35]Yeah, yeah.
[324:04.09]Okay, so I'll go back up.
[324:05.77]I wanna put that on, too.
[324:11.52]The manor's right here.
[324:12.64]Yeah.
[324:14.14]Is it...
[324:20.64]Getting lost is the best part of the game?
[324:22.24]Yeah, no, absolutely it is.
[324:24.48]Oh, this is wrong, but whatever.
[324:26.63]I want to put that flask on.
[324:32.83]Okay, the you don't take damage for one hit is huge, so... I feel like this is going to be insane.
[324:42.11]Very interested.
[324:48.77]It only lasts for 10 seconds.
[324:52.10]So, you drink it and just spam a move.
[324:56.20]Just spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam.
[325:00.20]And then be done with it.
[325:08.47]Lord Reikard.
[325:09.25]If this putrid field of death is what your blasphemy would bring, then I can no longer abide.
[325:15.47]No one can.
[325:16.21]What happened?
[325:24.42]It's this way.
[325:26.98]Where's Bugleberry?
[325:31.48]I'm just going to the front door.
[325:34.82]I actually spies that enemy.
[325:41.20]Where is the front door?
[325:42.64]Am I going the wrong way?
[325:49.04]Up and around, right?
[325:55.29]Yeah, there's a big guy standing in front of the front door.
[325:57.07]I don't remember where that was.
[325:59.53]Wait, is it right there?
[326:04.80]I can't make that jump though, can I?
[326:06.08]Yeah, I remember turning the corner.
[326:17.74]There we go, there it is.
[326:21.65]Alright, volcano manor time.
[326:23.17]Let's go.
[326:30.68]So what's with all this shit?
[326:31.70]Why is everybody hung upside down?
[326:40.59]Um... Oh, it's just a giant!
[326:48.57]Okay, I was like, what is that?
[327:00.12]That's fucking ridiculous.
[327:07.06]Wow.
[327:17.03]Okay, what is happening right now?
[327:21.55]Get out of the fire!
[327:33.27]Alright, alright.
[327:33.97]Can you make my bitrate of my stream go any lower, please?
[327:36.70]Stop.
[327:59.74]These guys are so much easier with magic.
[328:01.37]I can imagine being a strict melee character here.
[328:07.93]It's probably hell.
[328:10.93]And potentially like 5 to 10 levels to go, right?
[328:26.54]Yes, 5 to 10.
[328:27.56]What is the... All right.
[328:31.51]What would you guys say the, like, the soul level of this area is?
[328:34.61]90?
[328:34.63]85?
[328:37.01]90?
[328:37.03]A little bit higher, maybe?
[328:40.30]80?
[328:43.76]80 to 90?
[328:44.34]Okay.
[328:47.36]So, I mean, I'm not... I'm a little over-leveled for this area, but not, like, egregiously.
[328:53.47]We're around 90.
[328:55.45]Okay.
[328:59.18]I thought this was a mountain of fire, but I hardly feel a thing.
[329:02.20]I'll... Then what?
[329:09.30]You're fine, pretty much, level-wise?
[329:16.44]Yeah, it feels that way.
[329:19.34]Back over here.
[329:22.30]Ooh, lots of buds.
[329:36.09]Okay, that's... interesting.
[329:39.83]Alright.
[329:41.13]Let's head in the manor.
[329:44.14]Ooh.
[329:48.72]Oh, this place is cool.
[329:49.58]Looks like Resident Evil.
[329:53.52]Ah!
[329:53.82]Good thing I got Starlight!
[330:03.96]Don't miss the secret wall.
[330:07.74]Well, how are you supposed to miss?
[330:08.96]How are you supposed to not miss a secret wall if it's a secret wall and you don't know where it is?
[330:13.56]I'm probably going to miss it.
[330:26.77]Volcano Manor.
[330:29.87]I like this place a lot.
[330:33.08]This place is cool.
[330:41.81]It's kind of like a creepy vampire version of the round table hold.
[330:50.03]Those are NPCs.
[330:59.17]This is the place with the wall you have to hit 50 times.
[331:04.41]Aren't you precocious?
[331:06.13]We rarely receive visitors to the Volcano Manor without invitation.
[331:10.58]Fascinating.
[331:12.76]And not unlike another guest we had long ago.
[331:15.72]So tarnished.
[331:18.32]Have you ever harbored doubts about the burden of grace and the dogmatic ramblings of the fingers?
[331:24.42]I mean, recently, yeah.
[331:26.82]Why not join the Volcano Manor and fight with us?
[331:31.00]Rise with us against the Erdtree?
[331:34.78]Okay, but... Um... Okay, burn erd tree or don't burn the erd tree.
[331:56.78]It doesn't really fuck anything up.
[332:05.62]I don't like the way he's looking at me.
[332:08.88]Drawing room key.
[332:10.32]I don't like the way he's looking at me, by the way.
[332:12.08]As a new member?
[332:13.09]Intimidating.
[332:13.69]Very intimidating.
[332:14.67]I don't like that he has a very intimidating presence.
[332:37.68]The drawing room is through the hole.
[332:39.96]Use the key I handed you.
[332:43.59]The drawing use the key.
[332:52.75]Alright.
[332:55.86]That way or we can go up.
[332:57.36]Let me go up first.
[333:09.09]Am I going to get attacked here?
[333:10.33]Or are we on the same team?
[333:15.44]Oops.
[333:19.58]Hey!
[333:20.92]Get out of here, dog!
[333:23.00]Get out of here!
[333:23.48]There's a dog up here!
[333:24.53]Wait, what?
[333:27.49]Invaded?
[333:27.95]What?
[333:40.74]You're not even level 100.
[333:48.88]Giza's wheel?
[333:50.05]There's so much wacky shit in this part of the game.
[334:02.28]Where is that?
[334:05.84]D. Blood build up 70.
[334:12.13]70?
[334:12.15]This is probably the best blood item in the game then.
[334:25.30]Spinning wheel.
[334:26.24]Strike the wheel against the ground instead of spinning at top speed.
[334:30.08]Alright, that's pretty cool.
[334:31.04]That's the funniest weapon in the game.
[334:36.89]Those don't break.
[335:02.23]Nice smithing stone.
[335:04.73]Very cool.
[335:05.27]Well, that person... I destroyed them.
[335:07.59]Baby Rattle.
[335:09.59]Second best weapon in the game.
[335:16.19]Anything else that I didn't do?
[335:23.62]Alright, down the hall.
[335:24.88]Wait, I can level up.
[335:26.28]I think.
[335:29.90]Yeah, I can.
[335:35.28]62.
[335:35.30]56.
[335:35.32]This guy's tried two weapons and he thinks it's the best weapon in the game.
[335:47.71]It's up there.
[335:50.17]My eyes are the worst.
[335:54.60]I don't want to use the big one.
[335:55.40]It's like 10,000.
[335:55.68]That should do it.
[336:03.39]102.
[336:10.25]All right, let's go.
[336:24.04]Drawing room key.
[336:24.98]I don't wanna go in there yet.
[336:34.56]That's shut.
[336:40.15]Okay, I gotta go one room at a time.
[336:42.63]This is just wacky rooms probably, right?
[336:47.71]Let's go one room at a time.
[336:48.69]It's gonna be wacky rooms.
[336:57.16]Is there nothing in here?
[337:00.54]There's nothing in this one.
[337:14.09]Check the walls in these rooms.
[337:15.35]I can't swing.
[337:15.98]Hey, I'm new here.
[337:23.96]I'll be back.
[337:34.79]Doom bottle.
[337:43.06]Alright.
[337:43.92]Hi guys!
[337:47.94]A pleasure to meet you, Wavetarnished.
[337:51.74]I am Raya, the Scout.
[337:55.37]Very pleased to welcome you to the Volcano Manor under Lady Tanith's guidance.
[338:02.23]May you tread the path of valor.
[338:09.60]The Path of Valor.
[338:18.42]Letter from Volcano Manor.
[338:20.58]And... A Recusant Finger.
[338:26.75]Attempts invasion of other players' world.
[338:28.57]Oh, this is where you get... Is this permanent?
[338:35.55]And then where's the other thing that he's got?
[338:44.47]Where is it?
[338:47.41]Letter from Volcano Manor.
[338:49.34]A written request from Volcano Manor disclosing the name of a tarnish to be hunted.
[338:54.86]Old Knight Istvan.
[338:57.16]He can be found in Limgrave.
[338:59.29]Find the red mark on your map for the exact location.
[339:12.73]Why is it giving me like hitman assassin missions?
[339:17.23]That's funny.
[339:17.69]What are you doing here?
[339:34.67]Well, I hope you understand what you're saying.
[339:37.91]I thought you were tarnished, bred by virtue.
[339:41.13]Perhaps playing that part led you to your doubts, I wonder.
[339:45.19]But know that the path you walk is blasphemy and leads only to a miserable death.
[339:51.63]Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.
[339:58.13]This blasphemous path leads only to a pitiful death.
[340:02.17]Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on.
[340:07.03]Alright, well, I know you.
[340:10.76]Oh, it's you, is it?
[340:13.44]What's happening?
[340:13.86]Well, nice to see you again.
[340:16.00]So you've been invited as well, I see.
[340:18.36]Then we're comrades in arms henceforth.
[340:21.53]You watch my back, and I'll watch yours.
[340:24.25]Yes.
[340:26.90]Oh.
[340:27.00]Okay, let me tell you man.
[340:49.28]We should just bolt.
[340:50.34]We should get out of here.
[340:51.63]You're starting to believe your own bullshit here.
[340:55.17]You're starting to believe your own bullshit and that's not good?
[341:16.63]Alright, man.
[341:16.93]I feel like I'm on vacation here.
[341:18.64]And this is like a really expensive kind of LARP session with actors and shit, and they have to pretend that I'm
[341:46.78]Honorable warrior and stuff like I don't I definitely don't look like what I look a little bizarre These are all paid actors and I'm here and it's the LARP session LARPing on vacation.

[342:32.94]Come this way!
[342:33.72]And you do, like, a whole routine where they give you, like, a laser cannon or something.
[342:38.30]I swear to God, I think that's happening.
[342:40.98]It's $6,000 for, like, three days.
[342:44.57]It's already open.
[342:45.45]It's $2,000 a night.
[342:50.49]Do you get a lightsaber?
[342:53.91]How do they do that though?
[342:54.91]Like if you were gonna, okay.
[342:58.42]You can't like, nobody can like touch you, right?
[343:01.52]In a lot of these things.
[343:03.06]So if you were gonna like fight Count Dooku, how do you do that?
[343:07.62]With like a LARP with an actor?
[343:09.08]They have to be like, rebel scum, it's time for you to die.
[343:16.12]Hit me.
[343:16.68]It's your turn.
[343:18.30]It's your turn to swing the foam sword at my leg.
[343:22.93]Oh, you got me.
[343:23.99]Oh, and then go.
[343:24.67]How are they going to do this?
[343:29.29]Well, like, here we are.
[343:30.73]I've got my blaster cannon.
[343:32.11]There's the rebel right there.
[343:33.45]And there he is.
[343:35.06]There's the rebel.
[343:36.72]They're two sons, their daughter, and they're in Mickey Mouse t-shirts.
[343:41.24]There they are.
[343:41.72]All right, captain.
[343:44.31]We have to wait for the two-year-old to come up and hit us with a fucking stick.
[343:50.76]Oh, he got us!
[343:52.88]I don't even know how this plays out.
[344:02.00]That's going to be so weird.
[344:05.74]The honorable thing is to fall over while laughing.
[344:08.18]Yeah.
[344:11.68]Okay, this is like a 2.0 version of when, like, a three-year-old has a stick that they say is a magical wand, and they go like this!
[344:19.40]And you go, oh, oh, you got me!
[344:22.69]Ooh!
[344:23.27]And they do this two to three hundred times.
[344:26.01]It never stops.
[344:27.35]Ever.
[344:29.47]Like, you will be in the middle of eating dinner.
[344:32.63]You'll be eating food.
[344:33.65]You have a fork in your hand, and you have, like, eating pasta, and they'll be like... It's like...
[344:42.80]Yeah.
[344:43.54]Ooh.
[344:43.90]And they've run away laughing.
[344:45.08]You have to keep that up.
[344:46.25]Otherwise, it's not a magical stick, is it?
[344:48.87]It's not a magical stick, is it?
[344:50.17]If you don't keep it up.
[344:51.75]So if they do that one time and you don't commit to it, then it's like... What?
[345:00.10]Everything's a lie.
[345:01.18]I thought this was a magical stick.
[345:08.36]So that's gonna be like the 3.0 version of that.
[345:13.29]There's gonna be some- some stormtrooper's gonna be on his lunch break with a fucking sandwich in his hand, sitting outside, with the helmet off, and he's gonna be like... He's gonna look over, he's gonna see, like, the kid in the fucking, like, Han Solo t-shirt.
[345:26.30]He's gonna come up and do that.
[345:27.86]And he's gonna have to be like, Oh!
[345:30.22]Oh, nice job, son!
[345:32.48]Oh, hold on, let me get the helmet back on.
[345:35.37]Destroying property and laughing in the- Look at this place!
[345:38.81]Did you think I'd give a shit?! !
[345:40.96]I'm the strongest person in this room.
[345:43.16]Okay?
[345:44.54]You know why?
[345:45.08]Because I pay $2,000 a night to be here.
[345:48.66]So they have to deal with all of my bullshit.
[345:52.45]Hmm.
[345:53.11]Nah.
[346:01.91]I kind of want to like do it though.
[346:03.57]Right?
[346:04.22]And get really fucking into it.
[346:10.67]I want to like, have them like, we're like in a blaster battle and like go, like, like, like, like that got me and go down and be like, and roll over and like lie on my back and just like lie there.
[346:27.98]Would somebody come over and be like, oh, here, here's, here's like the medicine that we can give like to rebels that I, how, what would even happen?
[346:36.19]Do like dodge rolls and stuff.
[346:37.65]That would be so fucking annoying.
[346:39.89]All the actors would be like, get this fucking clown out of here.
[346:43.05]Like seriously.
[346:44.01]This is shit for like fucking children.
[346:52.68]When are you gonna do it?
[346:53.56]You should stream it.
[346:54.46]I don't think I would be allowed to stream that.
[346:56.48]Are you kidding me?
[347:00.07]2k a night.
[347:01.11]That's fucking crazy.
[347:04.67]Can you imagine if it was, like, they really went crazy with it, and you're in bed in your, like, hotel room, and they, it was, like, at, like, two o'clock in the morning, was like, we have an invasion from, here they come, here come, here come the, here come the, the, the last order, whatever they are, and, like, it's like, oh, shit, you gotta get up and, like, put your clothes on, get, like, your, like, blasters that are on the wall, and, like, oh my god, can we take a shower?
[347:30.47]Hold on, like, somebody turns the water on, like, well, let me take a shower first.
[347:34.53]And like they kinda have to like wait outside, like... They hear the water running, it's like fuck, they're taking a sh- somebody's in the shower.
[347:41.11]We can't like, we have to wait.
[347:48.15]I just don't know how it works.
[347:49.69]I'm very curious how that plays out.
[347:59.57]Don't forget the secret wall, alright, alright, alright.
[348:03.34]They stand there all night.
[348:06.50]Because that's what it is, right?
[348:07.58]It's like a... You are on board.
[348:10.28]An enemy vessel.
[348:11.58]Or something.
[348:12.63]From what I've heard, it's going to be something like that.
[348:21.47]There's secret walls here.
[348:22.55]I'm looking for them right now.
[348:27.76]People said dodge, dodge, dodge.
[348:29.22]I'm looking for the secret walls right now.
[348:39.82]I don't want to see them.
[348:47.19]Alright, I don't care about the secret walls.
[348:51.13]What am I supposed to do here?
[348:56.15]I don't get it.
[348:56.57]What do I do?
[348:57.60]Do I have to go do the quest?
[349:06.54]Just go do the quest.
[349:08.54]You missed the only wall that you didn't do that to.
[349:12.73]Which one are you referring to?
[349:20.47]You need this.
[349:24.14]First room, dumbass.
[349:26.52]I'm trying to find it.
[349:38.39]Dude, this is... I feel like you guys are lying to me.
[349:40.73]This is bait.
[349:41.53]This is horse shit.
[349:45.64]It's fucking impossible.
[349:46.98]It's impossible.
[349:48.64]This does not exist.
[349:50.48]It actually doesn't fucking exist.
[349:51.69]You're lying to me.
[349:57.69]I got it?
[349:58.61]No, I didn't.
[349:59.25]I didn't hear anything.
[350:06.92]Oh, it's a kid.
[350:08.28]This guy doesn't have Starlight on.
[350:09.48]Wait, why are there like slugs in the wall?
[350:42.99]This is kind of cool.
[350:44.33]This is ridiculous.
[350:45.19]I never would have found this if you guys didn't scream at me.
[350:51.10]There's more down here.
[350:52.50]Oh, great.
[350:59.06]Uh...
[351:04.85]Oh, no.
[351:05.19]These guys have way, way... I'm able to kill these guys without a problem now.
[351:13.42]Bloodhound Claws.
[351:16.02]That sounds pretty cool.
[351:19.72]Blood loss, strength, and dex.
[351:22.58]Ooh.
[351:22.80]Ooh.
[351:33.11]Alright, there's a way I could go back there.
[351:34.27]Don't let me forget.
[351:34.84]This is the door.
[351:50.74]Alright.
[352:05.06]What the fuck?
[352:14.48]Oh, shit.
[352:16.90]Oh, fuck.
[352:18.03]OK.
[352:51.07]Whoa.
[352:57.53]Go back.
[352:57.99]Go back.
[352:58.42]Go back.
[352:58.84]Go back.
[352:59.28]Go back.
[353:00.50]Rip content.
[353:01.56]Rip content.
[353:04.36]Go back.
[353:05.06]All right.
[353:05.66]All right.
[353:06.42]All right.
[353:22.41]You literally just told us to have you not forget that.
[353:24.85]I know.
[353:25.15]I'm just fucking kidding.
[353:26.81]I'm just messing around.
[353:39.23]Aww.
[353:44.95]Ugh.
[353:50.85]Do I even... I don't need to fight these things.
[353:53.15]That's the point.
[353:53.79]Invisible wall.
[353:55.16]Whatever the fuck it is.
[353:55.96]Oh, that's bad.
[354:14.83]Craved perfumer car man.
[354:23.51]Do the assassination before you do that, boss.
[354:26.47]I can't open this.
[354:40.00]This is not openable.
[354:45.01]Through the wall.
[354:48.83]What wall?
[354:53.64]Hit the wall 50 times.
[354:57.55]Which one is it?
[355:05.45]I don't care.
[355:06.63]Do I really?
[355:07.33]You think I'm really going to sit here and care about that?
[355:10.37]I'm not doing the 50 hit the wall.
[355:12.38]No, I don't care.
[355:13.20]Alright, so that was that.
[355:19.40]That was pretty cool.
[355:21.36]I am going to
[355:24.97]Um, I want a bonfire here.
[355:27.38]If you're like this, I'm far away.
[355:29.74]50 wall challenge.
[355:33.30]I'm not doing it.
[355:34.52]You can riot all you want.
[355:35.80]It's not happening.
[355:36.50]I'm not going to go hit the wall 50 times.
[355:38.68]We've all seen the gif.
[355:40.08]It's very funny.
[355:41.28]It's very interesting.
[355:42.74]It's a bug.
[355:44.34]And bugs are weird.
[355:45.57]And it's crazy.
[355:47.05]And it's a little kooky.
[355:48.23]I know.
[355:48.69]But I'm not going to do it.
[355:49.53]Alright, there's a bonfire right there.
[355:52.75]Let me go kill this guy.
[355:55.35]Where is he?
[355:59.33]Istvan.
[356:09.74]Keep going that way.
[356:16.18]Let me go do this.
[356:16.90]Why not?
[356:17.64]This is kind of interesting.
[356:18.46]I need to go here.
[356:26.25]Wait.
[356:27.09]This is an NPC, isn't it?
[356:28.25]Am I about to kill an NPC?
[356:49.48]Where is he?
[356:53.14]Oh, it's Isvan!

[357:55.00]He got tapped.
[357:55.68]He got tapped.
[357:58.14]You're evil.
[358:01.90]You're evil.
[358:15.09]Got him.
[358:16.37]Old Knight Istvan defeated.
[358:17.69]Is this just teaching me how to invade people?
[358:24.62]Imagine getting killed by this sus guy.
[358:27.20]Whoa.
[358:33.50]What's all that?
[358:37.52]Damn.
[358:41.90]Corroded metal is reinforced with rock-hard scales, making it highly effective against non-physical attacks.
[358:48.31]This thing's really unbelievable, actually.
[358:50.51]Damn.
[358:57.15]Alright.
[359:00.20]What else do they have?
[359:00.84]This is good, but it's a bit heavy.
[359:16.05]That's pretty good.
[359:16.49]Alright, cool.
[359:18.97]Now, I'm going to go back there.
[359:20.27]Do I just keep turning these quests in?
[359:33.26]You got a 5 o'clock shadow?
[359:34.29]It's more than that.
[359:34.99]I haven't shaved in like a week.
[359:48.92]That Istvan guy sucks.
[359:50.04]I'm going to go watch another streamer.
[359:54.18]You killed him in your playthrough too.
[359:57.19]In fact, you stood on top of a ledge and threw rocks at him.
[360:01.91]You're calling me out.
[360:08.03]So who do I turn this into?
[360:08.95]Alright.
[360:18.86]A recusant, just like you.
[360:21.48]Recusants have particular battle arts, styled to our methods of slaughter.
[360:27.25]Why not add some to your repertoire?
[360:33.91]Very interesting.
[360:38.18]Assassin's Gambit?
[360:40.58]Grants?
[360:45.23]Grants near invisibility and silent footsteps.
[360:49.21]Stormblade.
[360:49.99]This is... no skill.
[360:55.56]Very cool.
[360:56.04]You've come to understand now?
[360:57.84]To take power and make it his own, the recusant must hunt his own kind.
[361:02.42]To raise the flag of revolt against this sanctified pillaging, we recusants must become the most wretched of predators.
[361:09.29]All you can do is laugh.
[361:12.53]all right so you sell those what about you have you killed anybody I always resented these had a pale complexion but that won't be they'll be darkened by grit any more notes any more letters I can pick up what about you have you ever any strange sounds here at the manor yeah there's snakes in the walls beyond the walls like breathing or slithering scales oh it just isn't possible
[361:41.10]OK, so yeah, that's how you find out.
[361:42.82]All right.
[361:48.02]That sounds cool.
[361:48.46]What about the talk to the yeah, the lady over here?
[361:55.67]Did you read the letter left for you?
[361:57.49]That is the task the volcano manor desires you enact.
[362:01.35]You will be compensated once the deed is done.
[362:05.62]Amy.
[362:06.08]If you are loath to hunt your own kin, so be it.
[362:08.88]But you must leave this house at once.
[362:10.66]This is a war against the Erdtree.
[362:12.95]We have no place for the meek, nor the luxury of keeping clean hands.
[362:18.79]Amy, I did it.
[362:19.25]You've completed your tie, I am pleased.
[362:22.47]Now you are a recusant true and a full-fledged member of the Volcano Manor.
[362:28.34]This is your reward, as promised.
[362:36.53]It's faith bullshit.
[362:37.41]Give me more faith.
[362:37.99]Cool faith stuff.
[362:38.95]Throwing it in my face.
[362:40.03]Yeah, it is faith.
[362:41.46]I need 10 faith.
[362:41.94]Why is there a lump of magma?
[363:09.24]Sorceries?
[363:12.50]I need to put a... Guys, I have to put four points in faith.
[363:15.56]That's not happening.
[363:19.54]Or, that's going to cost like 400,000 souls.
[363:22.71]You can put a talisman on to do it.
[363:25.75]Yeah, but I don't want to do that.
[363:27.73]I'll test it out, maybe.
[363:31.31]Okay, so now... Alright, so you're going to give me another task when I reload the area?
[363:37.45]Okay.
[363:44.16]now you are I am pleased looking forward to fighting that guy because you know I am someone please kill him that horrendous serpent preta reichardt
[364:12.25]Here to put the demigods to the sword.
[364:15.55]Why is it like this?
[364:16.23]Then please, kill the great serpent.
[364:20.66]You spoiled it.
[364:21.50]The one that devoured Praetor Reichardt.
[364:26.20]I left the serpent slaying spear in the lord's chamber.
[364:31.45]Worthy tarnished.
[364:34.07]Brandish the spear and run him through the great serpent.
[364:38.97]Alright, so where is it?
[364:41.11]In the Lord's Chamber?
[364:45.07]Have you killed someone?
[364:46.95]I haven't heard an enemy in probably 30 minutes.
[364:48.63]Besides that one guy.
[364:49.81]Someone must kill him.
[364:51.43]Despair him.
[365:10.61]Okay, so a big snake ate this guy.
[365:13.07]And he's now like... In the Lord's chamber is a spear.
[365:20.95]Where's the Lord's chamber?
[365:22.77]How do I get in it?
[365:26.22]Lord's chamber.
[365:27.04]Alright.
[365:30.86]Where's the Lord's chamber?
[365:32.44]Is it this door over here?
[365:39.67]Okay.
[365:40.01]Well, I'm going to imagine... I'm going to imagine here that... I'm going to imagine that that's something that I get after doing all the assassin quests.
[365:53.29]That's a guess.
[365:54.48]What?
[365:54.66]I don't know.
[365:56.08]We're just going to go that way and I'm going to walk on the rooftops.
[366:09.17]It was a letter.
[366:12.55]I'll do it later.
[366:13.91]I want to walk around.
[366:14.93]I want to explore this.
[366:34.24]I don't even think about poisoning me.
[366:49.79]You can't do the boss before the assassinations.
[366:52.87]That's what I figured.
[366:54.09]But, you know, I'm sure there's going to be bonfires all over the place.
[366:56.66]And I can teleport to other bonfires and finish up.
[367:00.84]This area is so cool.
[367:01.70]I want to see it.
[367:14.20]Oh, yo.
[367:21.29]I was way too late on that.
[367:26.21]Shit!
[367:26.31]These guys suck.
[367:36.04]Don't even do it again.
[367:37.26]I almost just got grabbed again.
[367:56.19]No!
[368:01.43]This is such a- I- Fighting this guy off on this ledge sucks, because like, I don't want to fall off the edge.
[368:13.53]No!
[368:23.39]I thought he was gonna move backwards.
[368:24.97]It's a pain in the ass.
[368:33.88]Okay.
[368:46.47]Very cool.
[368:53.67]I could go around the rooftops.
[368:55.61]And you know what?
[368:56.45]That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
[369:05.21]Good.
[369:18.29]Fuck, I'm overwhelmed.
[369:20.13]That way, that way, that way, that way, that way.
[369:22.06]Okay, there's like four ways to go.
[369:25.48]Let's just go.
[369:25.86]I'm going to just walk around the perimeter.
[369:48.00]I think he loves this game.
[369:50.48]I do.
[369:51.10]It's just... It's so good, but it's... No!
[369:54.93]I want that.
[369:55.31]I don't care.
[369:55.57]I'm going down now.
[369:59.89]Who the fuck are you?
[370:00.67]Alright, looks like we're going down.
[370:16.56]Great Omen Killer Cleaver.
[370:21.69]So many weapons.
[370:22.77]How do you even pick one to play with?
[370:24.03]You know what I mean?
[370:29.15]How are you supposed to pick one of these?
[370:30.46]Where is it?
[370:41.83]Oh.
[370:43.87]There it is.
[370:45.07]Blood loss, strengthen decks.
[370:49.07]Hideous horns cause blood loss, adding vibrant colors to the ongoing mayhem.
[370:55.66]Cool.
[370:57.58]Alright, well it looks like we're going to do ground level first.
[370:59.08]Okay.
[371:11.36]You have 58 int.
[371:12.50]Why don't you have any good sorcery?
[371:15.29]Uh, because this character is kind of a little bit of sorcery.
[371:19.77]A little bit.
[371:20.49]Sprinkled in.
[371:21.70]It's mostly int weapon scaling damage.
[371:24.90]I wanted to swing an int weapon.
[371:27.71]Grocery's fine.
[371:29.26]I use it sometimes.
[371:30.16]I have a lot of cool spells.
[371:32.98]Pre-pump or pre-patch.
[371:37.52]I didn't really want to use it too often.
[371:39.92]Like a lot of the spells I was finding were dog shit.
[371:45.95]There's like three moves that I actually like to use.
[371:50.91]So I'm sure there's others.
[372:01.85]Build is fine.
[372:03.09]Yeah, I mean, I... I wanted... Okay, here's the thing.
[372:06.34]When I first played From Software Games, for the most part, my first playthrough is fucking... My god, I'm gonna fucking shit my pants.
[372:18.79]These dogs, seriously.
[372:21.53]Um...
[372:23.62]What was I saying?
[372:24.96]Okay, I usually like to do a melee build.
[372:27.84]Like an 80-90% melee.
[372:29.34]I feel like it helps me learn the game a little better.
[372:34.50]Oh, make no mistake about it.
[372:46.84]I will absolutely... This is cool though.
[372:49.18]I will absolutely make characters that are just 100% Faith or 100% Sorcery.
[372:54.83]And just don't even fucking swing a weapon.
[373:02.45]Okay, what about up here?
[373:10.19]Says I don't fucking use Sorcery.
[373:13.53]I am... Erdtree seal.
[373:15.19]What is that?
[373:15.71]By the way, I don't know why every time I talk about this move, I do like the Boston guy.
[373:20.45]I don't... I'm not understanding why that's happening, but it is for some reason.
[373:30.69]Where is it?
[373:31.19]What did I just get?
[373:33.67]Erdtree seal?
[373:34.59]I still have this mog thing.
[373:45.25]Where is it?
[373:53.83]God damn, man.
[373:54.83]I... I feel like I have, like, a fucking, like, purse full of shit.
[373:59.37]I don't even know where anything is.
[374:01.35]What was it?
[374:03.66]It's a faith weapon?
[374:07.44]But sometimes I seriously feel like I'm looking at, like, a TF2 backpack.
[374:13.03]Like, why do I have four of these?
[374:14.89]I need to, like, consolidate some of this shit.
[374:16.89]Do I really need, like, six of the same weapon?
[374:19.36]Like, honest to God, like, do I need these?
[374:25.80]Alright, you said it's a faith weapon?
[374:35.25]Oh.
[374:40.01]So this is, like, a faith cast thingy.
[374:45.01]See?
[374:45.29]Scaling to start.
[374:46.05]Where did the other one start?
[374:46.87]See?
[374:47.05]Secret wall!
[374:56.50]Always look!
[374:57.08]Don't bother looking for it.
[374:59.36]We, the Chat Chat, don't like it.
[375:07.87]Chat... You guys are calling yourself Chat Chat?
[375:19.72]I actually kind of like that.
[375:22.60]Uh, alright.
[375:23.34]Let's go through here.
[375:26.20]I'm a ma- The rooftop's up there, too.
[375:28.16]Let me see if there's anything over here.
[375:29.16]We can go this way.
[375:33.68]Okay.
[375:54.90]Chit chat with the chat chat.
[375:59.43]Nice Super Mario 64 level name.
[376:03.87]I'm definitely gonna use this.
[376:27.80]Fuck.
[376:39.75]Gravity!
[376:42.65]I'm dead.
[376:43.29]Alright, I made a dumb joke for no reason.
[376:55.05]Now I'm far away.
[376:56.77]Like a fucking idiot.
[377:14.79]Well, I can go on the rooftops.
[377:16.25]Calling it.
[377:17.65]I thought you were dead.
[377:40.95]Dude, wicked chaotic cringe vibes.
[377:50.16]Alright, right there.
[377:51.96]Uh, but hold on just a moment.
[377:56.16]I'm not ready to throw in the towel here.
[378:00.26]I want to see what's up here.
[378:10.06]Oh, MonkaS.
[378:10.52]Whatever, fuck that.
[378:26.41]not really that great um don't die there's a bunch of souls over there
[378:48.25]I mean, but here, I'll be fair, though.
[378:50.73]That move, that's a sorcery move.
[379:00.54]That's a sorcery move.
[379:02.18]That actually scales off of intelligence, so I am casting a spell.
[379:07.27]Don't, please.
[379:09.49]Seriously, I'm...
[379:22.12]Bud, can you slow down?
[379:23.56]Bud, stop doing the same move over and over again without me getting a turn.
[379:43.95]Oh.
[379:48.73]I thought I was gonna be safe opening the door!
[379:55.19]Oh fuck, is that a person?
[379:56.60]I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[380:16.73]We're good.
[380:18.48]Mom said it's my turn to attack.
[380:20.44]Yeah, I mean, that's how it works.
[380:24.99]You go... And then I go... And then you go... See?
[380:30.07]This guy gets it.
[380:54.77]Go play Final Fantasy, kid.
[380:57.93]I mean, actually, what I've heard is a phenomenal fucking game, so... Your insult didn't work.
[381:09.76]Kid...
[381:12.23]Come on, kid.
[381:15.17]I know I gotta get my souls, but there's a thing to do over here, and I know I don't have any mana potions or potions, but I'm still going in.
[381:22.83]Hey.
[381:33.56]Hey.
[381:34.16]Something about, you know, fucking Starlight, kid.
[381:51.26]What's wrong with these guys?
[381:57.38]I thought that was an invader.
[382:11.83]What contraption are these guys in?
[382:15.39]It's terrifying.
[382:24.41]Wait, I... This is... I don't know.
[382:27.58]Progress, I think.
[382:29.70]Let me go back.
[382:38.94]How are you a wizard and you have less mana than my strength and faith build?
[382:44.50]Because you're way over leveled.
[382:46.56]Your soul level is like 150.
[382:56.75]You're over leveled.
[382:57.33]I'm not.
[382:59.41]176 actually.
[383:01.53]Alright.
[383:02.47]Who cares?
[383:02.99]But where's my souls?
[383:03.75]They're right here.
[383:06.15]I'm just going to run in here because these guys are a huge pain in the ass.
[383:10.42]Does that cope?
[383:10.96]Yeah.
[383:12.28]Yeah.
[383:13.80]For all I know, that guy could be still level, like, 50 and really good at the game.
[383:31.15]Don't get caught up in this.
[383:41.95]Alright, what was in here?
[383:42.74]This is a stone sword key.
[383:45.94]Alright, plus one.
[383:55.51]Greatly increases maximum stamina.
[383:57.65]I mean health.
[384:01.87]Wow, that's actually a lot.
[384:05.04]I'll take the stamina one off.
[384:15.89]I'll drink.
[384:23.90]You're gonna kill me.
[384:24.60]That's my cue.
[384:33.24]Ah!
[384:33.76]Ah!
[384:33.88]Ah!
[384:40.98]Alright, where did I want to go?
[384:41.82]I'm just running by this after this.
[384:50.52]These guys are horrible.
[384:58.01]Elden Ring.
[384:59.07]Elden Ring.
[385:00.51]I bought this game and I'm starting to regret it.
[385:02.53]Let me help you here.
[385:07.25]You should...
[385:09.26]You got... Okay, these guys here.
[385:11.71]You got these summoning spirits.
[385:13.63]Use them.
[385:14.47]All the time.
[385:14.95]Whenever you can.
[385:16.39]Don't... Stop saying refund the game.
[385:18.52]Come on.
[385:21.42]You got summoning to help?
[385:23.83]Don't feel like... Okay, let's say you're...
[385:26.63]Let's say you're reliably getting a boss down to like 30% health after using all your flasks.
[385:33.22]Okay, let's say you have like 4, 5, 6 flasks, right?
[385:35.56]You drink, drink.
[385:37.28]You're trying so hard after like 20, 30 attempts.
[385:39.94]You're getting the boss down to like 30%.
[385:41.71]I mean like so he has 70% health remaining.
[385:45.41]What I would advise you to do is don't worry about the boss.
[385:48.83]Forget about the boss.
[385:50.11]Turn around and go here.
[385:55.78]Don't go... I mean, I'm assuming maybe you're here.
[385:57.50]Maybe you're, like, doing this shit here.
[385:58.77]Maybe you're fighting Margit or something, right?
[386:00.91]Turn around and, like, go over here.
[386:02.75]And go fight this stuff.
[386:05.13]Go over here.
[386:06.17]Explore Fort Haight West.
[386:09.09]Check out the Erd Trees.
[386:11.66]Go level up five to ten times.
[386:14.59]And then you'll come back here.
[386:16.05]And after, like, you know, sometimes it takes, like, three or four plus five plus hours, right?
[386:20.49]I wouldn't say grind.
[386:21.71]I don't think grind is the right word.
[386:23.95]I think the right word is... Go play the game.
[386:29.83]And if you're getting stuck on something, there's no reason to continue to suffer.
[386:34.47]Go play.
[386:35.60]Go find a... Go find a dungeon.
[386:38.38]And just go clear it.
[386:39.80]They're much easier than the actual... Alright.
[386:42.44]So, for instance...
[386:44.16]Like, Merc Water Cave is 100 times easier than fighting Margit.
[386:52.85]100 times easier.
[386:59.95]Another thing I'll give you for a tip, because, I mean, I'm an Elden Ring streamer, right?
[387:03.19]I'm an Elden Ring streamer.
[387:04.60]This is what I'm going to give you advice on.
[387:07.85]Another thing you should take into consideration is you need to start to understand.
[387:12.50]Never mind.
[387:13.62]What am I going to say?
[387:15.52]You need to understand iframes.
[387:18.06]So what that means is.
[387:20.26]I feel like I'm making the spy fucking like ambassador video again.
[387:26.75]And like years later, people were like, wow, dude, this is like dog shit advice.
[387:30.85]I hope nobody listened to you.
[387:33.93]Okay, that's right.
[387:38.33]You need to learn iframes.
[387:39.79]What that means is you are completely invincible.
[387:41.57]Your character cannot get hurt even a centimeter of your health.
[387:46.13]Right now.
[387:46.97]Now.
[387:47.77]Now.
[387:48.73]Some people have these swings where you're trying to get hit when you're invincible.
[387:55.27]Don't think about getting away.
[387:56.41]I gotta get away from this guy.
[387:57.41]No.
[387:57.61]You want to get near that guy when he's swinging.
[388:02.75]You want to get hit by the sword when you are invincible.
[388:07.35]Get it?
[388:12.53]It's not about getting away, it's about getting hit when you are invincible.
[388:20.31]Now watch me not do that over and over again, but it's just theory.
[388:29.59]There's a lot, but here's, okay, I know that like, oh man, we're all like, man, we're all FromSoftware buds, we're all FromSoftware fucking chums.
[388:36.75]We, I got like 6,000 hours.
[388:38.45]There's a lot of people that they literally just got this game for the first time.
[388:42.45]And they have never played a FromSoftware game, ever.
[388:46.05]You know, we, how about the new players?
[388:48.39]Okay.
[388:51.14]Don't you guys understand that the more people care about this stuff,
[388:56.33]The more, like, money that comes in, the more that FromSoftware gets to keep making cool stuff like this.
[389:03.73]Think about it, right?
[389:05.41]The more companies will make games like this.
[389:08.90]It won't just be 5,000 markers on a fucking goddamn open-world mini-map that is just, go touch this thing in the world, and that's literally it.
[389:17.82]If we get more shit like this, the more people care about it.
[389:20.32]There's still 500,000 people still playing this.
[389:25.11]Accept these new players.
[389:26.43]They're- they'll- they- let them- and it's gonna be hard, and the game sucks.
[389:31.07]You're gonna be pissed, but you'll get it.
[389:32.91]You'll get it.
[389:34.35]Eventually you will, and you'll feel happy about it.
[389:42.21]Where am I?
[389:42.47]Okay, I got it.
[389:43.39]So now let me go in here.
[389:47.67]Kinda- it kinda changes the design, though, since they can't afford to take as many risks.
[389:53.28]Um, I don't know.
[389:55.24]That's what people have been saying.
[389:57.72]I remember when Dark Souls 3 came out and everybody was like, oh, fuck, here we go.
[390:01.92]Ah, here come the normies.
[390:03.35]They're going to start playing it because it's a popular thing now.
[390:06.63]And that game kicked my fucking ass.
[390:08.13]That was one of the hardest games I ever played.
[390:11.53]And then they made Sekiro and the same thing.
[390:14.37]Oh, God.
[390:16.25]I saw the trailer.
[390:17.22]Here come the normies now.
[390:19.64]It's gonna be ruined.
[390:20.90]Sekiro's gonna be fucking easy.
[390:22.70]It's gonna be the simplest game ever.
[390:24.76]Activision's publishing it.
[390:26.16]It's gonna be... You're gonna have, like, ten extra lives.
[390:29.86]Sekiro was one of the hardest things I've ever done in my whole life.
[390:33.51]That was actually the hardest game I've ever played.
[390:35.81]It was un-fucking-believably difficult.
[390:37.71]It was unbearable.
[390:39.01]Un-bearable at times.
[390:42.23]And then this came out.
[390:44.27]And now, let me, before I say anything.
[390:47.02]Do I think that this game is harder than Sekiro?
[390:49.14]No.
[390:49.98]I don't.
[390:51.14]I think this game is as hard as you want it to be.
[390:56.32]Because of the open world nature of it.
[390:58.16]Because you are allowed to go wherever you want.
[391:02.40]Sekiro will go down for me as probably the... Stop talking!
[391:08.87]Secura will go down.
[391:10.37]That's probably the hardest thing I've ever done.
[391:12.74]Truly.
[391:15.24]But this game is... I would say you can say it's accessible, right?
[391:19.88]But it's only as hard as... It's only as easy as you're going to make it.
[391:23.68]You can... There's no, like, easy mode, right?
[391:27.90]You don't start the game and go, oh, yeah, I'm going to play on normal, casual experience where, you know, you have a good time and the story plays out and...
[391:37.32]No, you have to learn how to make the game easier.
[391:40.47]The game's not going to tell you how to make it easier, but you can.
[391:43.89]And if you need to level up a few more times, then whatever.
[391:47.41]Who cares?
[391:47.81]That's not a big deal.
[391:49.99]If you get enjoyment out of coming here at soul level 60 or 70, damn, that's going to be fucking hard.
[391:55.81]Why are you still talking?
[391:57.66]You're stun-locked.
[392:05.36]Have I been just rambling?
[392:06.82]I'm a streamer.
[392:08.12]I'm literally live streaming right now.
[392:12.29]I'm not supposed to talk?
[392:15.75]I'm literally live streaming right now.
[392:22.04]Fucking starlight kid.
[392:25.48]But do I think this game could be the hardest one?
[392:27.49]It could be.
[392:28.59]I think the bosses so far have been some of the hardest.
[392:32.93]When you fight them at the current level that you're supposed to be in quotes.
[392:38.98]But I think this is...
[392:40.95]This is probably the most enjoyable of the FromSoftware games.
[392:45.14]I truly believe that.
[392:48.94]If you want to play a game that's going to literally beat the ever-living fucking shit out of you without any remorse, it's Sekiro.
[392:59.41]This game can be that, but it doesn't have to be.
[393:05.38]And I know that there's bosses coming up here in the next, like, six to ten hours in the game that people have said, oh my god, I wanted to fucking uninstall the game.
[393:13.98]Right?
[393:15.14]We'll see.
[393:15.48]Dark Souls 2 is the most enjoyable, but you get to decide that depending on how you play these games. ...
[393:34.62]Is Sekiro still more than $60?
[393:36.04]Is it really still full price?
[393:38.62]I mean... But my long-winded point with this was a lot of people were concerned when these games started to become popular.
[393:48.47]And... I mean, pre-patch for Dan should prove to you that that kind of didn't matter.
[393:58.03]And some of the bosses that are in the end of this game that I've heard are un-fucking-bearable.
[394:02.39]So...
[394:04.70]I still think it has the same charm.
[394:06.44]I still think it has the same pull.
[394:09.37]I still think it's a very, very difficult, fun, enjoyable, interesting experience.
[394:19.85]Need more balancing in the game.
[394:23.54]I'm concerned about the spirit summons changing the balance for non-users.
[394:30.41]Yeah, but that is kind of hard mode, isn't it?
[394:34.07]If you don't use a summon, then the game is designed for you to be utilizing that stuff.
[394:42.18]You can make this game as hard or as easy as you want, which is cool.
[394:52.08]Okay, Margit and Godric...
[394:57.03]Back to back?
[394:58.19]After having no experience in the game and having not played a FromSoftware game in a while?
[395:01.54]What is that noise?
[395:04.60]They were really, really, really hard for me.
[395:08.45]They were very hard.
[395:09.39]They were very difficult.
[395:11.89]Um...
[395:15.27]There were summoning signs outside the door in the other FromSoftware games as well.
[395:20.31]You could summon a person to come help you.
[395:22.45]Not just co-op.
[395:24.49]There would be a summoning sign at a lot of bosses in all the other FromSoftware games.
[395:29.53]So that's kind of the same thing, isn't it?
[395:37.24]Market is harder than 90% of the bosses in this game.
[395:41.97]I'm trying to think of who I... Besides Rodan, which Rodan I thought was insane.
[395:46.41]Godric was difficult, but Godric felt fair.
[395:51.89]Who has felt... I mean, Rinala was alright.
[395:56.63]Once you... Okay, Rinala was bad until you figured out, like, kind of the gimmick behind it.
[396:06.08]Summons are way tankier than some players.
[396:10.55]Rycard is pretty hard.
[396:11.49]Well, we're about to find that out probably very soon.
[396:13.19]People unironically say these things and still have stacked bugged buffs in the fucking game and complain about bosses.
[396:24.56]I mean, there's a lot of crazy shit in it.
[396:28.60]But isn't that the point of all these games?
[396:30.98]Is they're unbelievably difficult until they're not?
[396:35.34]I was tearing my fucking hair out playing against Margit.
[396:38.84]And if you put me against Margit right now, I would probably beat him in one or two tries.
[396:44.52]It's just like I don't understand what's happening.
[396:47.56]I keep dying to this.
[396:48.90]This is un-fucking-bearable.
[396:50.06]This game sucks.
[396:50.99]It's too hard.
[396:52.53]I would probably beat him first try.
[396:54.51]Maybe second try.
[396:55.33]Because I just know everything that he does.
[397:01.31]That's quite, yeah, that's quite a comment.
[397:05.06]Your forehead looks sweaty.
[397:06.09]It's because it is.
[397:09.79]Very.
[397:10.84]Very much so.
[397:20.76]I'll wash your faces.
[397:23.58]It's because there's a piece of hair falling down.
[397:25.10]It makes me look, like, greasy.
[397:27.28]There.
[397:27.68]I fixed it.
[397:43.09]But... Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[397:45.49]But let me tell you.
[397:46.15]I... This game has so much content...
[397:51.87]That even, okay.
[397:53.94]What are you using as a weapon?
[397:57.36]What even is this thing?
[397:58.48]Do I get that?
[398:03.22]This game has the same amount of content, I think, as like all the Dark Souls games in the series have together, combined in all their DLC.
[398:11.62]It's a little ridiculous.
[398:15.22]Alright, these travel.
[398:18.09]Where does this go?
[398:22.08]What's your point?
[398:23.68]What do you mean, what's my point?
[398:25.38]I've been making it the whole time!
[398:28.32]Somebody said that they're afraid that this game is too easy, or that with the popularity comes a, uh, the game is gonna be too easy, and some ROM software is gonna keep making games, and they're gonna be simple.
[398:40.96]And my point is that they've proven that that's not the case.
[398:44.82]45 minute explanation.
[398:46.32]It's a goddamn pod... Just title it Podcast About From Software, okay?
[398:51.60]You have pointed ahead.
[399:00.45]That last boss in Sekiro, though.
[399:02.31]Oh, man.
[399:05.17]That was one of the most unbearable experiences.
[399:09.51]I think that took... It took me, like, I think 50 to 60 attempts to beat that guy.
[399:15.27]And it was pain and suffering.
[399:20.21]That was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
[399:25.36]He's easier than Margit.
[399:27.12]No, not a chance in hell.
[399:29.08]Not in a hundred million years.
[399:38.23]You don't have to parry every single move Margit does to you.
[399:44.21]You do with that other one.
[399:45.73]Alright, there's a... Hold on.
[399:53.19]What is up here?
[399:57.06]I had a lot of trouble with the ape.
[399:58.78]Yeah, that was bad too.
[400:10.40]Oh, what's that?
[400:15.33]Some of these bosses are harder than the last boss, this hero.
[400:19.81]I have to imagine, right?
[400:21.15]I'm imagining that's probably the case.
[400:36.06]But also, do I think this game is nearly as good as what everyone's saying?
[400:38.72]No.
[400:40.86]I think Dark Souls 2 is probably better.
[400:42.10]Dark Souls 1 is probably better.
[400:44.02]Mario Sunshine is probably better.
[400:47.30]I think this probably sits at like... I think the Dark Souls Prepare to Die edition on PC I think is a little bit more polished than this game is.
[401:17.96]Alright, I don't wanna go that way yet.
[401:26.85]No, it's go- okay.
[401:28.09]Trying to take my special baby Bloodborne away from the number one spot's gonna be really hard.
[401:39.38]Oh.
[401:44.14]I fought you on that bridge before, I know what you do.
[402:04.82]That one was the lock-on.
[402:19.87]I got it.
[402:28.03]Oh, still got it.
[402:53.15]Panic!
[402:53.45]Stop panicking!
[403:11.33]Stop!
[403:31.54]Oh!
[403:32.16]Sorry.
[404:04.25]shit what the fuck
[404:20.46]Oh, I don't have any mana!
[404:46.29]Damn it!
[404:50.43]My stamina!
[404:53.61]Oh, I had it!
[404:54.39]I just like figured... God damn it!
[404:59.40]I shouldn't have even drank the potion.
[405:00.98]I just was panicking because I was like, fuck.
[405:12.73]It wasn't even greed.
[405:13.67]It was just... Fuck!
[405:15.69]Alright, where was that?
[405:19.61]Oh, damn it!
[405:20.93]I'm so mad.
[405:25.93]Down here.
[405:29.24]Oh, I had it too.
[405:30.56]Oh, I'm so frustrated at myself.
[405:32.20]Why did I even... I shouldn't have even drank it.
[405:34.00]I could have killed it.
[405:42.86]Other bonfire?
[405:43.68]Oh, yeah, the bridge, the bridge.
[405:44.81]Right, right, right.
[405:48.01]Well, I'm kind of fucked here.
[405:55.85]And look, now I'm going to get in my head and I'm going to fucking lose over and over again.
[405:59.11]Shit!
[406:14.31]Alright, which bonfire?
[406:15.17]This one here, right?
[406:24.46]First try... Oh, the church?
[406:30.67]oh you know now you know what really fucked it up it was me doing the weapon art without any mana I just that that was that was the big mistake because if I had known that I didn't have any mana if I'd even looked I wouldn't have done it and I wouldn't have gotten hit that like third time okay all right let's do it
[407:19.96]Dude, please change to your other hand.
[407:22.42]You fucking idiot.
[407:49.37]Thank you for watching.
[408:30.67]Oh, you can do it, too, through that fucking wall.
[408:32.55]All right, stop tilting.
[408:35.41]Just fucking play.
[408:35.93]Come on.
[408:36.09]Come on.
[408:53.93]Fucking stop rolling!
[409:23.93]Oh shit!
[409:28.47]Up!
[409:34.67]Oh, wrong button!
[410:04.60]Fuck!
[410:19.35]Fuck you, the timing on that sucks absolute balls!
[410:52.70]Okay.
[410:58.09]Godskin Stitcher.
[411:01.21]And Noble Presence.
[411:02.53]Woohoo!
[411:08.04]I feel like you made this boss in The Sims.
[411:21.89]Serpents and what?
[411:35.86]Amnion from a womb that bore unintended offspring.
[411:40.40]It will never dry out, remaining damp indefinitely.
[411:42.82]That's kind of disgusting.
[411:49.95]Okay.
[411:56.63]Just like your forehead.
[411:57.53]Shut up.
[411:58.77]Leave me alone.
[412:02.81]That was the McRiddler.
[412:06.17]Alright, what do we got for time?
[412:07.86]Alright, it's getting late.
[412:10.98]I think I'm gonna call it here.
[412:14.98]About seven hours.
[412:17.94]Oh, I got this too.
[412:25.03]Where is it?
[412:28.73]X and strength.
[412:30.37]Oh, it's that thing.
[412:31.43]Okay.
[412:34.13]This is a good time to stop.
[412:37.26]So I am going to tentatively tell you.
[412:40.04]Can't handle a full shift?
[412:47.14]Um, I mean, my Elden Ring streams have been like 10 hours.
[412:50.20]9 to 12, some.
[412:52.53]It's just, I haven't been feeling that great.
[412:55.31]So I kind of don't want to push it more than like 8 plus 9 plus hours, because I know I will.
[413:00.77]So I'm not gonna.
[413:03.28]I've had stomach... You guys know.
[413:05.80]Colitis, proctitis, that shit.
[413:07.34]It's back.
[413:08.58]It's flared up and I'm trying to take care of it.
[413:11.04]I have medicine for it.
[413:11.92]It usually takes like a week or two sometimes to get rid of it.
[413:15.74]To put it back into... I guess you'd call it remission.
[413:20.98]Let me clean some stuff up first.
[413:24.52]Let me see.
[413:27.02]Let me see.
[413:29.66]It's been pretty much tentative if I can stream.
[413:33.10]Sitting here is really not great.
[413:35.98]I really need to go do stuff with my body more than a few times.
[413:42.82]So let me tentatively say that the next stream will be on Tuesday.
[413:48.26]If I get up tomorrow and I'm fine, I might just stream tomorrow.
[413:52.80]Let me tentatively just say Tuesday.
[413:57.93]Um, there's so much more left in the game, I can't wait.
[414:04.16]So, Tuesday, so the 22nd.
[414:08.32]If I'm feeling up to it tomorrow, then maybe, but let's just say Tuesday.
[414:11.54]Same time, around 4.
[414:14.78]Um, yeah, it's annoying, but, you know, sometimes it has to be a thing that's dealt with.
[414:20.12]And it usually is dealt with very quickly.
[414:24.40]Let me level up first, though.
[414:34.95]Alright, endurance is now at 20.
[414:36.23]That is exactly where I wanted it.
[414:38.35]I don't need to do any more than that.
[414:39.63]That's perfect.
[414:42.81]We still have a lot to do here.
[414:44.07]And then there's even more to do here.
[414:53.08]This game is... I just don't even know what to say.
[414:56.38]Is there more up here?
[415:00.30]Yeah, have a great night.
[415:01.02]Thanks for sticking around.
[415:02.05]I know these have been going late.
[415:05.86]I know I start late and they go late.
[415:07.82]So I apologize if it's like 3 o'clock, 2 o'clock in the morning for you right now.
[415:12.96]But we will continue.
[415:13.96]We'll pick it up on Tuesday right from here.
[415:16.46]I'm assuming that I gotta go this way and maybe even this way.
[415:19.30]And then we're probably gonna get towards like the final finale of the game, I would say.
[415:26.48]Another two or three streams maybe, total.
[415:31.16]Are you going to do Cornholio on Tuesday?
[415:33.36]Well, it depends on if I die like 40 times to the same boss.
[415:38.14]I'm going to rest here.
[415:39.34]Call it.
[415:39.64]There's still a ton more left.
[415:43.73]Yeah, there is.
[415:44.35]There's a lot.
[415:46.13]I'm really looking forward to it.
[415:47.07]Probably going to be like four streams.
[415:54.72]That's awesome.
[415:56.00]That means I get to play more.
[416:02.01]But much love to you.
[416:03.65]Thanks for sticking around.
[416:06.41]Keep an eye on the sus.
[416:09.43]Tuesday, tentative.
[416:10.93]Tuesday the 22nd at 4 o'clock Pacific.
[416:14.19]More Elden Ring.
[416:21.66]We are going to be changing it up a little bit soon.
[416:25.70]Ludwig and I are going to be doing a stream together on the 29th.
[416:31.55]should be a fun time it's gonna be kind of mayhem but it'll be fun I'll probably break up elden ring again this week so if I stream elden ring on tuesday then probably you know maybe on wednesday or thursday we'll do something else break it up break it up a little bit go back to ellen ring on the weekend and then the uh stream with me and ludwig
[417:01.72]House Flipper has new DLC?
[417:03.79]Well, I mean, that's... I gotta play it, right?
[417:10.39]Did you do a DOS night?
[417:12.13]You know, that actually is not a bad idea.
[417:16.43]Sounds kind of fun.
[417:18.39]We'll break it up, because I don't want just every single stream to be Elden Ring.
[417:22.24]Because even for me, I gotta break it up too.
[417:33.00]No, it's not until May.
[417:33.82]Oh, okay.
[417:37.76]Avoid the adult DOS games.
[417:39.58]Yeah.
[417:45.37]It's been a week since you played?
[417:46.53]Yeah, but... I mean, the next game... I'm playing Elden Ring for at least another seven or eight hours on Tuesday.
[417:57.24]There'll be plenty more.
[417:59.12]And I have essentially committed to completing the game on stream, so I don't think there's going to be a scenario where that doesn't happen eventually.
[418:07.77]Can we see Otto next time?
[418:20.87]Yeah.
[418:22.65]Yeah, I'll put Otto on camera next time.
[418:27.42]Progress-wise, we kind of explored a lot.
[418:32.37]I got through a little bit of the manor here.
[418:33.85]It's just so easy to sink just days into this game.
[418:42.79]It's just ridiculous.
[418:44.72]All progress is good progress.
[418:45.96]That's right.
[418:48.36]Yeah, new map too.
[418:51.52]I also want to go back out here.
[418:52.62]I want to do the assassination missions.
[418:57.41]And I want to look around the manor a little more.
[419:01.58]I feel like I kind of ran by it.
[419:02.66]Alright, see you guys on Tuesday.
[419:07.38]Keep an eye on Sus.
[419:14.26]Make a to-do list?
[419:15.28]Yeah, I did that a few streams ago.
[419:17.50]And it was way, way... I was way more calculated.
[419:22.79]I knew the three or four areas I was going to go on stream, and I went there.
[419:29.88]So I'll do that.
[419:30.34]All right.
[419:31.78]Good night, guys.
[419:32.51]See you Tuesday.
[419:32.97]Take care of yourselves.
[419:34.17]Bye.
[420:04.09]you
