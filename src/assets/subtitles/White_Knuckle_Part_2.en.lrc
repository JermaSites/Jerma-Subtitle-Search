[00:48.70]How's it going?
[00:53.64]Gonna continue.
[00:57.01]Where I left off with White Knuckle.
[01:02.03]You're just joining us a few days ago.
[01:04.82]I beat Act 2.
[01:09.94]But I fell down when I was getting into the elevator in Act 2.
[01:17.42]I fell down in real life and I maybe moved my hand and I fell down.
[01:23.15]It's like a place where you don't usually die or lose, but you know.
[01:30.06]Well, that's what we're doing today.
[01:32.02]We've got a lot on schedule over these next few days, three or four days.
[01:40.39]And I'm going to tell you all about it if you stay tuned after the ad break.
[01:44.73]Let's get rid of the pre-rolls.
[01:45.85]I'll see you in a few minutes.
[01:46.84]Let's hope it starts.
[01:47.88]Let's go.
[01:48.84]He said, have you tried rose hip tea like I asked, Jeremy?
[02:01.71]Don't be so mean about it.
[02:04.48]I have not.
[02:11.23]What, even 80s disk jockey voice?
[02:15.56]Actually, me and Holly were talking about this.
[02:17.68]I think it was yesterday.
[02:21.53]Of all the things that have, like, think about the last, like, 30, 40, 50 years.
[02:25.81]Think about how much has changed.
[02:27.53]How much TV has changed.
[02:28.88]How much movies have changed.
[02:30.12]Just how many different technology jumps we've seen.
[02:32.28]One thing that has stayed constant for the last hundred years is this guy in commercials.
[02:42.00]Let me tell you.
[02:43.08]Okay, well, we'll talk about it when we get back.
[02:47.63]I'll see you guys in three minutes.
[02:48.57]Ads just started.
[02:49.33]We'll be right back.
[02:50.21]We'll continue that conversation.
[02:55.38]See you in a few minutes.
[05:12.27]Oh, somebody said, why are you typing in the chat?
[05:14.25]You could just talk.
[05:16.19]I mean, I could just talk.
[05:17.47]That's correct.
[05:18.50]I could just talk.
[05:22.26]But I want to participate.
[05:23.20]Sometimes I like to participate in the chat room.
[05:24.90]What's up with that?
[05:27.68]Hey, I'm still at the gym.
[05:30.99]Can you come back later?
[05:34.65]Hey, one more set.
[05:37.41]One more set, dude.
[05:39.35]One more set.
[05:42.04]You can do it.
[05:45.72]Or something, I don't know.
[05:47.84]Alright, welcome back.
[05:48.46]Okay, so anyways, what we were saying.
[05:50.75]Before I was interrupted.
[05:52.35]Well, I wasn't interrupted.
[05:53.15]I knew that was happening and I decided to take, to leave.
[05:55.87]But now that I'm back.
[05:58.21]One thing has stayed constant in the world.
[06:00.99]No matter what happens, it feels like.
[06:03.68]The infomercial voice guy is still here doing stuff.
[06:08.02]And if you act now for only $14.99...
[06:11.26]That has never really gone away.
[06:13.47]So much has changed in the world.
[06:14.93]So much has changed in how we receive communication and television.
[06:19.71]That guy still does that.
[06:26.16]Is the TikTok YouTube voice now?
[06:27.80]No, I don't think it is.
[06:32.55]To me, this is the TikTok voice.
[06:34.37]The TikTok voice is like this.
[06:35.77]Guys, here's what I found out today.
[06:37.98]Listen to me what I did.
[06:39.95]That's... Let me tell you what I found on TikTok.
[06:42.64]No, no, no.
[06:43.76]I'm talking about this one.
[06:45.38]Can you believe it?
[06:46.20]That if you act fast, only $14.99.
[06:49.08]That's not the TikTok voice.
[06:52.45]It's different.
[07:00.82]I hate the TikTok voice.
[07:02.42]+2.
[07:03.32]What?
[07:03.60]What?
[07:10.83]The inflection is impossible for AI.
[07:13.16]Is it though?
[07:15.92]Like, is it actually?
[07:19.46]Is that infomercial guy unreplicatable?
[07:24.31]I feel like it actually kind of might be unreplicatable.
[07:28.35]I feel like AI would sound a little bit weird.
[07:30.33]Instead of, and if you act now, it would be like, and if you act now.
[07:35.84]And if you act now, right?
[07:37.43]It wouldn't sound right.
[07:38.19]It's, and if you act now, I don't think AI can do it.
[07:44.96]And also AI would just have the next sentence start immediately after the first one.
[07:50.53]And if you act now, $14.99 is included.
[07:53.43]It's not going to work.
[07:55.83]AI, I don't think it's going to understand the nuance of being that guy.
[08:09.47]Hey, you have to pick one.
[08:10.57]It hasn't changed in decades and not enough of the training data for AI to learn it?
[08:16.60]Wait, what do you mean?
[08:19.38]Give it like two years?
[08:23.41]What the fuck?
[08:26.49]Dark Souls 2 stream?
[08:27.71]Dude, what the fuck?
[08:36.04]Alright.
[08:36.22]You guys ready?
[08:37.12]I'm ready to do some runs.
[08:41.47]Hey, in practice, we're going to fold at act two, baby.
[08:45.27]Alright, we'll see what happens.
[08:46.71]You guys ready?
[08:50.98]I did play a tiny, tiny bit off stream.
[08:56.27]And it was an absolute catastrophic failure, but I learned a couple of things.
[09:01.67]I did one run off stream, but it was a miserable failure.
[09:08.38]I think I'm going to surprise a lot of people for just how fluid this is going to be.
[09:13.37]How good I'm going to put playing.
[09:17.34]Are you ready?
[09:18.00]Let me warm up.
[09:18.52]I gotta do a warm up run.
[09:23.83]I'm getting close to Ster score.
[09:25.11]I only need like 25 times more points.
[09:31.84]Alright, let's go.
[09:33.20]Let's surprise everybody.
[09:35.75]I gotta remember how to play the game.
[09:46.74]Alright, learning again.
[09:47.86]I got it.
[09:51.83]For those of you that don't know, this is a game about climbing.
[09:58.53]Oh, what the?
[09:59.60]Okay.
[10:00.62]Don't fucking do that.
[10:02.30]That is early.
[10:03.34]We gotta get that out of the way.
[10:13.07]If I eat something, do I have any food?
[10:14.19]No.
[10:17.20]Alright, that one threw me off.
[10:18.52]The fucking windows unplugged my mouse.
[10:20.69]Just blew everything first.
[10:21.87]Like, that doesn't count.
[10:23.01]You know what I mean?
[10:23.63]I got fucked up from that.
[10:25.09]I was in a flow.
[10:32.93]Fluid gamer?
[10:33.65]That's an excuse?
[10:34.33]No, my mouse unplugged in the middle of that!
[10:42.07]Okay, I gotta have a warm-up run.
[10:43.98]You gotta warm up once.
[10:45.48]I'm hopeful, but glad we're not doing any betting, by the way.
[10:58.67]His mouse unplugged again?
[10:59.58]It may have.
[11:01.94]It could have.
[11:06.70]Alright, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[11:10.07]Everybody chill, we're good.
[11:14.94]Bugs?
[11:15.56]Uh, I did get some money off stream.
[11:22.83]I did.
[11:31.68]Alright, now we're getting a little fluid here.
[11:38.49]Now we're getting fluid.
[11:39.27]That's what I'm talking about.
[11:49.86]There we go.
[11:50.98]Now we're fluid.
[12:01.76]He cheated the money to 9999?
[12:07.46]Shut up!
[12:10.31]Uh, no I didn't.
[12:11.75]Somebody said turn on the accessibility settings.
[12:13.59]I did.
[12:14.87]I did.
[12:15.23]They are glowing a lot brighter now, if you're probably noticing.
[12:18.32]Oh, he's in a mood today?
[12:27.93]Stop reading chat, otherwise you're not gonna be able to fucking go fluid.
[12:33.46]This is a no chat day.
[12:36.13]Let me go ahead and tell you what's going on over the next few days.
[12:40.18]Ladies and gentlemen, today, white knuckle, until I don't give a fuck.
[12:46.19]Tomorrow, are you ready for this?
[12:48.99]I hope you're sitting down for this.
[12:51.48]I'd like to formally announce that I got Dracula 3 working.
[12:55.51]Dracula 3 works.
[12:57.47]It was the hardest one to get to work.
[12:59.67]I've been putting it off forever because that game is fucking impossible to run on any system.
[13:04.64]I had to install and reinstall and try.
[13:07.78]Honestly, go look this up.
[13:08.94]You think I'm making this up?
[13:10.25]Go look up Dracula 3 issues.
[13:13.21]There are threads, there are forums of people being like, hey, this doesn't fucking work.
[13:16.98]Can somebody please help me?
[13:18.36]There's like 18 different ways to get this to work on Windows 10 and plus and more.
[13:23.59]I finally got it to work.
[13:25.83]I finally got it to work today.
[13:27.61]So tomorrow, we're going to play Dracula 3.
[13:32.78]And we're going to get the boys together to do some sponsor stuff over the next couple days.
[13:38.17]We're going to play Towerborn.
[13:40.03]I think it's Meester, Poke, and Kryken.
[13:42.89]I'm going to play Towerborn, a sponsored stream.
[13:45.88]We're going to play it again on Wednesday, and also Dracula 3 on Wednesday, too.
[13:50.75]So it's going to be three days in a row.
[13:52.63]Also, this weekend, I am considering.
[13:56.95]I am considering a Bush Light Sunday.
[14:01.10]That's what I'm thinking.
[14:02.14]I'm considering it.
[14:02.92]I haven't locked it in yet.
[14:03.96]It might be next weekend.
[14:05.60]Speaking of things that are happening potentially in a week.
[14:08.52]House Flipper Invitational 3 Round 2.
[14:12.77]I'm trying to get off the ground on the 24th.
[14:16.49]Seems like we got most people are cool with it.
[14:19.84]I'm looking like Round 2 is going to be the 24th.
[14:23.29]So there's a lot going on over the next week plus.
[14:27.23]If you're ready.
[14:29.00]Somebody said, I thought you were going to retire on June 26th.
[14:31.90]I can address that.
[14:33.22]I already did.
[14:33.76]This is all post-retirement.
[14:41.33]That's why, like, nothing fucking matters anymore.
[14:43.09]I can just do whatever.
[14:52.77]I'm running out of shit.
[14:58.46]You took a break?
[15:00.93]Yeah, I told you, this is my kind of who gives a shit arc.
[15:04.13]I'm just going to do whatever the fuck I want.
[15:06.50]It could be anything.
[15:08.20]I don't know.
[15:12.31]It might be Dracula 3.
[15:18.22]I'm just gonna do this until I kinda don't want to anymore, and right now I want to, so... That's all there is to it.
[15:26.55]So you better not piss me off today, okay?
[15:28.19]That's what I'm telling you.
[15:36.19]Hey, break room!
[15:38.15]Did we all bet on the break room?
[15:45.10]I think that was pretty fluid.
[15:46.20]By the way, I got up there real quick.
[15:48.02]50 bucks in bank.
[15:50.76]Why did you have to come back?
[15:53.75]I just felt like it.
[16:03.58]What would you say somebody said something?
[16:08.44]When we're all in retirement homes, they're going to play Jerma clip compilations in the main room to pacify us.
[16:14.46]I... I don't think that's gonna happen.
[16:20.19]Okay.
[16:22.73]I think 20 years from now, you're gonna be like... Who's that fucking guy that we... You're gonna be in a room with a bunch of buddies.
[16:29.08]You'd be like, who was that guy that we used to watch?
[16:32.08]Was that with Jay, I think?
[16:34.63]Like, Johnny or something?
[16:36.39]Like, Joe?
[16:37.53]I don't remember.
[16:39.05]He was kind of a weirdo.
[16:39.89]I don't know.
[16:41.61]Fucking fuck that guy.
[16:42.71]Who cares?
[16:53.19]I don't like this one.
[17:03.60]And we've never done this one.
[17:09.03]And ironically, I will never forget you.
[17:13.56]I would prefer if you just remembered how much fun we had here, you know?
[17:18.04]You don't gotta remember me specifically.
[17:19.28]Remember how you felt.
[17:21.29]How did you feel?
[17:24.63]I am fucked up today.
[17:25.55]Okay, I'm sorry.
[17:26.49]I am a weird today.
[17:30.52]I don't think I want this one.
[17:31.32]It screwed me up last time.
[17:38.13]Would you ever do shuffleboard?
[17:39.65]No.
[17:41.41]I want to see what this one does.
[17:43.45]This is last for 10 minutes.
[17:44.70]I guess it gives you more items.
[17:47.46]That was kind of loud.
[17:50.04]I'm going to turn it down just a tad.
[17:57.29]What's this?
[17:59.47]Can I open this?
[18:02.13]Is this a bomb?
[18:03.83]What is this?
[18:06.88]How do you open it?
[18:12.46]Oh.
[18:13.70]Two stakes.
[18:15.71]How useful.
[18:21.77]I guess those can just appear.
[18:23.35]I'm not buying anything else, although I probably should get that.
[18:26.53]I'm going to clean my inventory up before I go for this.
[18:30.18]This is a mess.
[18:32.47]Not like a messy inventory.
[18:35.79]I got a lot of good stuff, though.
[18:38.34]I think this is going to be an Act 2 W. Alright, let's go.
[18:51.53]Looking good.
[18:58.02]Alright, what we got?
[19:05.34]Oh, you know what?
[19:06.54]Fuck this.
[19:09.44]Let's go.
[19:24.76]Okay.
[19:27.51]I'm definitely way ahead of the slime or whatever it is.
[19:33.58]Oh my god, I freaked out.
[19:34.58]I freaked out.
[19:35.24]I freaked out.
[19:36.06]I freaked out.
[19:38.91]Alright, it was going really well until right there.
[19:41.13]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[19:42.17]Alright, everybody relax.
[19:43.45]Quiet.
[19:53.26]I don't know what's going on here, guys.
[19:56.39]My hands are sweating now.
[19:59.39]Everything was going so well, too.
[20:02.77]I'm alright.
[20:03.29]Just relax.
[20:03.74]I'll get it.
[20:09.72]My hands are sweating, that's why.
[20:13.51]Anybody have a solution to that, by the way?
[20:16.09]Like, what do you do?
[20:16.69]Like, I can't take my hands off the mouse right now.
[20:18.87]I just can't.
[20:19.25]You gotta get in the flow.
[20:30.78]I was actually gonna get gloves, I'm not kidding.
[20:32.74]I was gonna get, like, gamer gloves.
[20:48.60]Okay, go that way.
[20:52.90]There's a mouse with an air conditioning unit in it?
[20:59.16]Wait, is that real?
[21:00.10]I actually kind of want that thing.
[21:04.51]My mouse is wet again.
[21:05.95]Alright, relax.
[21:20.41]Alright, crisis completely averted.
[21:21.97]That's good.
[21:28.15]Definitely want that for later.
[21:30.41]Oh, fuck.
[21:32.96]Alright, where are we off to?
[21:33.74]That way.
[21:37.72]Good.
[21:38.18]Move.
[21:46.31]Okay.
[21:46.73]What do we got?
[21:48.11]What do we got?
[21:49.09]What do we got here?
[21:50.13]Got it.
[21:55.48]Good.
[21:56.06]Keep going.
[22:03.15]I don't like that.
[22:09.24]Come on man, what's going on here?
[22:12.82]Come on man, what the fuck is this?
[22:22.16]Okay, this part sucks, but let's go.
[22:39.18]Gotta whack him.
[22:40.78]Alright, whacked.
[22:47.17]Come on.
[22:47.79]Come on!
[22:49.85]Almost there.
[22:53.64]Don't love what just happened, but it's fine.
[22:57.49]Shit.
[23:03.52]Come on, dude.
[23:04.08]Get off me.
[23:05.72]Come on, get off me!
[23:10.33]Dude, what the fuck was that?
[23:16.50]That's dog shit.
[23:26.37]You can throw shit at them?
[23:28.38]I wanted to save all my stuff for round two.
[23:32.42]That actually might be unironically the worst room in round one.
[23:39.00]I think I would rather do any of the other ones.
[23:41.12]It's alright.
[23:48.07]That's a warm-up.
[23:48.59]We're good.
[23:50.39]We're getting back in the flow.
[23:58.60]Don't pick up every item.
[24:02.48]I mean, I just kind of get grabbed.
[24:04.12]What I should have done is I should have whacked.
[24:06.94]I shouldn't hold on.
[24:08.17]I gotta focus for a second.
[24:10.07]Hold your applause.
[24:10.71]Okay, let me just do this.
[24:37.57]Okay, let's be careful.
[24:39.51]Okay.
[24:43.98]I would love to grab the other side of this.
[24:47.90]Like that.
[24:48.22]There we go.
[24:57.83]Okay, we're good.
[25:01.43]Yeah, I'd rather do the... What's the other stuff that can spawn in World 1?
[25:08.32]No!
[25:10.82]What the hell did I grab?
[25:29.79]That was so lucky, whatever I just did.
[25:46.03]Okay, do I have anything?
[25:48.38]I gotta go this way.
[25:53.68]Don't fall off, please.
[25:54.99]I almost just walked off the edge.
[26:08.36]No!
[26:13.84]I need more items.
[26:33.31]Anything here?
[26:51.32]This is probably a mistake, but whatever.
[26:55.95]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[27:00.61]Okay, we're good.
[27:00.97]Oh!
[27:18.67]Oh!
[27:21.41]Somebody say my grandmother can go faster than this?
[27:25.70]No way, I'm playing actually exceptionally.
[27:48.11]Holy shit.
[27:59.94]Your grandmother can't do that.
[28:02.82]My grandma has raw gamer instinct.
[28:07.20]I don't believe that, but it's fine.
[28:11.23]What did I get stuck on?
[28:16.89]Gold cookie bug?
[28:18.49]Hmm, I'll go this way.
[28:28.92]Oopsie.
[28:35.61]Alright, we're almost to the break.
[28:45.01]Oh, you fool.
[29:00.89]Hey, alright, we made it back to the break room.
[29:02.25]We're good.
[29:02.71]You play a lot of game where you literally just go up.
[29:06.36]It's because I like forward progress.
[29:12.28]Smash 100 roaches?
[29:14.37]What?
[29:15.17]I can't believe I just got that achievement.
[29:20.44]I'm just hoarding money as well.
[29:26.14]Dude, okay, I'm looking over here.
[29:28.91]Is there actually...
[29:30.81]a mouse that has a little fan in the middle that blows air into your palm.
[29:36.90]If there's not, I kind of feel like that could work.
[29:44.60]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[29:47.95]Chris, the damage of your hammer, you can now hammer in pittance with a single swing.
[29:51.63]That's actually massive.
[29:56.92]I don't love this one, but I feel like it helped last time, didn't it?
[30:03.29]The mouse is real.
[30:03.95]It probably sucks as a mouse, but might work for sweaty games like this.
[30:15.09]My grandma was a bowling champion.
[30:17.07]You should do a stream where you and the boys compete against grandmothers.
[30:30.91]That's kind of funny.
[30:32.81]I'll take it.
[30:35.77]You were really slow, but the climbing speed is insane.
[30:43.26]Should I?
[30:48.73]You know what?
[30:50.03]Maybe I should buy some of this stuff.
[30:52.82]No, I can't.
[30:53.72]I can't use any money.
[30:55.68]I will only use money when this gets to 100.
[30:57.52]Alright.
[31:05.07]Let's go.
[31:09.94]The climbing speed is actually insane, but it's going to screw me up.
[31:14.33]You know it will.
[31:14.83]I don't even know if we're doing bets right now, but just be careful.
[31:18.14]That's all I'm telling you.
[31:31.99]um I don't like this I don't love this I don't love this yikes I mean I move so quickly it's actually crazy
[32:01.64]It's kind of fucking me up though.
[32:03.10]It's fucking me up.
[32:04.12]It's very fast, but I'm not having a great time.
[32:06.69]I'll tell you.
[32:15.15]It kind of messes with the flow of how I operate.
[32:18.46]I want that.
[32:30.90]Jesus!
[32:40.06]Oh my god!
[32:40.98]Even though it's messing with my flow, I'm doing a pretty damn good job.
[32:56.50]Okay, uh, gotta get up.
[32:59.52]Uh-oh, wait a minute.
[33:00.22]Remember this last time?
[33:00.97]This screwed me up last time.
[33:04.51]Good.
[33:05.07]We're good.
[33:05.39]We're good.
[33:05.63]We're good.
[33:13.21]Oh, fuck.
[33:14.99]Stop.
[33:15.95]Relax.
[33:21.59]Where do I go?
[33:22.35]Fuck!
[33:22.97]I'm freaking out.
[33:23.66]Stop freaking out.
[33:24.22]Stop freaking out.
[33:25.24]Stop freaking out.
[33:25.94]I gotta get my fucking balls in order.
[33:29.12]There we go.
[33:29.51]Up there.
[33:36.10]Alert.
[33:37.20]Air exchange ventilation cycle delayed.
[33:40.70]Atmospheric pressure may fluctuate unexpectedly.
[33:48.49]Fucking hammer it!
[33:49.45]What are you doing?
[33:50.35]I hit it like seven times!
[34:08.08]Go, come on.
[34:09.24]Almost there.
[34:23.42]Dude!
[34:26.07]What?
[34:26.65]Dude!
[34:28.15]Dude!
[34:39.42]Dude!
[34:42.05]Oh
[34:54.52]I freaked out.
[35:10.57]I couldn't fucking do it.
[35:12.29]Let me close this shit.
[35:18.44]Okay, I'm in it to act two.
[35:24.73]Wait, there was a bedrun if I was even going to make it past Act 1.
[35:28.65]Nobody had any faith today, damn.
[35:30.84]Nobody had any faith.
[35:37.86]This is too stressful.
[35:38.58]You should have a facecam.
[35:40.63]No facecam can exist when there are no clothing on the streamer.
[35:46.65]That's just the way it is.
[35:57.74]It's so hot.
[35:59.70]It is like 105.
[36:00.36]What is it in Vegas right now?
[36:02.52]105, 106 Fahrenheit?
[36:08.75]What's the temperature in the room right now?
[36:11.42]Temperature in this room right now is 78 degrees Fahrenheit in this room that I'm in right now.
[36:22.53]So you have an AC.
[36:25.06]The AC is on.
[36:29.80]is 78 degrees in this room.
[36:34.64]And a lot of times it goes up to about 81, 82, even with an AC.
[36:41.26]You have a broke-ass AC?
[36:43.80]Well, here's the deal.
[36:45.06]Let me explain this to you, because I know this might sound bizarre, but... Especially when you're streaming, if you're in a room, that room usually doesn't... The room I'm in right now does not have a temperature monitor for the AC.
[37:01.38]The AC usually picks up sensor from... Usually it's like a living room or a hallway.
[37:06.10]It's not in this room.
[37:09.09]So...
[37:11.04]It's like 80 degrees in here, but it's like 74 degrees everywhere else in probably the entire place.
[37:26.24]Now, you could have, like, I would have to have a whole other AC unit put in.
[37:31.71]But I'm not doing that.
[37:34.04]logistically I've asked I've had like companies come out here and I've asked them about this and they're like you kind of need to potentially reduct everything and that's not going to happen um so and if there was a sensor in here ac would probably be running 24 7 which it might actually make everywhere else like an icebox besides this room
[38:05.35]And somebody said you could get a window unit.
[38:07.59]That's a good idea.
[38:08.79]The problem is, because this microphone is set up the way it is, if I had an AC unit right here on, it would be like this.
[38:20.73]So guys, I wouldn't... It would be annoying.
[38:26.24]It would be an incredibly loud white noise.
[38:31.74]This has been a problem, by the way.
[38:33.04]I think like every streamer that you probably watch deals with this to some degree.
[38:40.77]Because there really is like, it's a weird logistical way to actually have two separate thermostats in two separate places of your apartment or house or something.
[38:51.87]It's very difficult.
[38:55.67]It's lights plus the PC.
[38:56.98]Yeah, it's just this room gets hotter.
[39:03.43]You need a ductless split.
[39:04.71]It would solve the temp noise and logistic issue.
[39:10.70]I'll ask about that.
[39:15.49]But then I might have to reduct the entire place.
[39:18.28]And that might, depending where the vents are, like that might not, I feel like that's not potentially possible.
[39:23.29]You'd have to like redo everything.
[39:25.67]We got an HVAC guy in chat?
[39:28.13]Fucking hell yeah.
[39:42.26]save after getting the perk?
[39:44.08]Wait, it doesn't save it.
[39:45.46]Oh, shit.
[39:48.63]I did not know that.
[39:51.21]Why did you move to Vegas?
[39:54.36]That's fine.
[39:56.48]We're good.
[40:00.57]Oh, that's good.
[40:02.82]Oh, that would be, what, 230% climbing speed?
[40:05.58]Should I just go crazy?
[40:16.14]That's huge too though.
[40:17.79]I might do the jump.
[40:21.53]I'm doing this one.
[40:27.14]Five bugs.
[40:27.94]I know I said, I told you I said I wasn't going to spend any money until I got to 100.
[40:30.41]I don't care.
[40:34.45]This could be the one.
[40:35.45]This could be a victory.
[40:38.48]I'm going to get, I got to get ready because this part sucks.
[40:40.80]This is act two.
[40:45.78]This is going to be insane.
[40:47.16]Congrats, believer.
[40:49.42]I'm going to give you an opportunity to bet on this because you may have already.
[40:54.61]I don't ever underestimate my ability to blow everything.
[40:57.85]That's what I'm saying.
[41:05.09]Do not underestimate my ability to blow it.
[41:09.61]Alright.
[41:11.72]I'm going to do it.
[41:12.28]I got it.
[41:12.64]I got it.
[41:14.08]Just go.
[41:15.04]Why even stop?
[41:15.82]Just go.
[41:22.82]Why do I already hear the fucking stuff?
[41:26.21]Did you see?
[41:28.07]What was all that?
[41:28.57]What was that about?
[41:29.89]Alright, chill.
[41:33.86]We're good.
[41:34.14]Oh, this is going to be fucking crazy, dude.
[41:38.30]Let's hear this.
[41:39.04]I'm going to make it back through.
[41:41.56]Back through?
[41:52.18]This little shit just blew it.
[41:53.38]Okay, we're good.
[42:06.26]Just because I have super speed doesn't mean just relax.
[42:09.04]Don't go crazy.
[42:11.56]Super speed is great, but just chill, dude.
[42:14.75]Just relax.
[42:31.75]Just chill.
[42:33.17]See, this is what happens when you just chill.
[42:37.46]Relax.
[42:57.28]We got so much time!
[42:58.28]Time!
[43:01.32]We have so much... time!
[43:19.40]Just don't get fucked over by the steam.
[43:25.53]I know a lot of people have Pepe laughing because I can't handle the steam and they're like, just wait till he gets to the steam room.
[43:30.42]Bros, just wait till he gets to the steam room.
[43:50.34]That's the worst room of Act 2.
[43:52.94]And I just did it.
[43:53.86]We had a terrible seed.
[43:56.03]Terrible.
[43:57.01]Terrible seed.
[43:58.71]But we're good.
[43:59.54]Steam room incoming.
[44:00.38]Don't Pepe laugh or I'll fucking ban you.
[44:44.74]Almost there.
[44:56.02]What's wrong with me?
[44:59.39]Why am I going so slow?
[45:00.23]Oh, because of my climbing speed, right?
[45:01.34]Alright, this is it.
[45:58.52]Hold.
[46:22.17]Alright, you wanna show you something?
[46:24.46]I'm here!
[46:25.48]No, wait, there's another one!
[46:26.76]Shh, quiet.
[46:27.42]Hold.
[46:35.58]Hold!
[46:50.06]Announcement.
[46:51.56]The local authority requests immediate reporting of an unusual residence.
[47:20.21]Can I get your head under there?
[47:31.54]Alright, let's go!
[47:32.67]Okay, okay, okay.
[47:33.29]Watch this shit!
[47:34.31]Watch this shit!
[47:36.91]Yeah!
[47:37.65]Watch this shit!
[47:38.31]I'm gonna fucking destroy this.
[47:39.71]Hey, Believers, you just won.
[47:41.73]Guaranteed.
[47:42.46]You know why?
[47:43.10]I fig- I found something out!
[47:45.68]I figured something out!
[47:47.18]Check this shit out!
[47:49.49]I'm gonna fucking destroy this.
[47:52.64]Everybody hold, watch this shit.
[47:54.54]You ready to fucking scream?
[48:02.33]I hope you bet a lot because I'm gonna show you what's about to happen right here.
[48:06.76]He Googled it?
[48:08.40]I didn't Google it.
[48:09.69]I didn't Google it.
[48:10.53]I failed miserably off stream.
[48:14.79]And then I realized something.
[48:17.43]Check this out.
[48:22.80]You ready to see this?
[48:24.66]I didn't Google it.
[48:28.18]Oh my God, I just probably screamed.
[48:32.15]Alright, everyone relax.
[48:33.33]Watch this, come on.
[48:40.72]Oh, it missed.
[48:41.92]Wait, hold on, it missed.
[48:46.85]Whoa!
[48:51.61]Oh, fuck!
[48:52.05]I still have to hit that one!
[49:02.61]Yeah!
[49:03.83]How do I get out of here?
[49:05.79]How do I get out now?
[49:06.55]How do I get out now?
[49:10.94]What do I do?
[49:11.48]How do I get out?
[49:14.74]Is this it?
[49:21.39]I did it!
[49:25.27]I did it!
[49:29.27]What?
[49:30.72]What?
[49:31.90]Oh shit, it ain't over yet.
[49:35.47]Oh shit, it ain't over yet.
[49:42.08]Everybody hold your fucking applause.
[49:47.66]What?
[49:48.45]Okay, everybody fucking quiet for this.
[49:52.39]Oh fuck, okay.
[49:57.04]Everybody fucking relax.
[50:01.75]We're gonna do this slow as shit.
[50:05.95]What do you mean, danger?
[50:35.62]Oh!
[51:28.38]I AM UNSTOPPABLE!
[51:32.12]What do you mean run?
[51:35.11]What?
[51:35.89]WHAT?
[51:36.77]OHHHHH BOY!
[51:38.49]AHHHHH!
[51:49.87]What the fuck dude?
[51:51.75]No fucking way.
[51:53.69]There's no fucking way.
[51:55.35]There's no- fuck this game.
[51:56.83]Okay, fuck this game.
[51:58.54]That is a fuck this game scenario.
[52:03.26]What the fuck is that?
[52:04.96]Are you kidding me, dude?
[52:11.67]Slow and steady.
[52:12.53]I was tr- and then like I heard the te-
[52:18.09]You panicked?
[52:18.87]I- dude, how many times- I gotta go through this elevator, jump, jump back to the elevator, press all the buttons, go back to the elevator, jump over, jump, press the buttons, go back to the elevator!
[52:28.93]Oh, that sucks fucking balls!
[52:37.36]Oh my god, that's so awful.
[52:47.54]I cannot fucking believe it.
[52:50.76]I thought that was it.
[52:51.72]I was like, surely they're not gonna make you do that three different times.
[52:55.83]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[52:59.62]Alright, whatever.
[53:03.85]Well, now I know that.
[53:08.11]Right after I said I am fucking unstoppable.
[53:14.20]Okay, so Act 2 is un-fucking-bearable.
[53:18.00]Let's just make that clear.
[53:29.79]Okay, now that I have the game knowledge that not only do you have to do that so many times and get back to the elevator.
[53:37.68]Oh shit, hold on.
[53:41.16]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[53:51.91]And it starts counting.
[53:53.52]30 seconds goes by pretty damn quick.
[53:57.62]Did you see how far away I was?
[54:00.35]You gotta move.
[54:00.99]The second you press that button, you gotta move.
[54:02.81]What the fuck was that?
[54:03.74]What?
[54:04.42]Oh.
[54:09.69]That shit's mean.
[54:10.89]That's a mean thing to do.
[54:12.07]I will say.
[54:13.57]Mean.
[54:13.71]Mean.
[54:25.23]I gotta get three rebarbs.
[54:26.87]30 seconds is less of a problem?
[54:33.70]Well, I don't know.
[54:34.38]Does the facility explode?
[54:37.39]When I hear you have 30 seconds to do this, and I'm like, wait a minute.
[54:40.11]Is this shit gonna... The elevator's gonna fall.
[54:42.04]It's not the goop that's the problem anymore.
[54:43.50]It's the fucking exploding elevator.
[54:50.44]I'm gonna have to do it.
[54:51.48]I'm gonna have to actually do it.
[54:53.28]Dude, some of those grabs were so difficult too.
[54:56.03]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[55:06.35]I was, I sure, I was like, surely this is it.
[55:26.06]I need items.
[55:28.45]There's a vendor at the elevator.
[55:30.03]Oh, don't you worry.
[55:31.89]I'll be buying three rebarbs.
[55:33.92]Guaranteed.
[55:42.49]Let's go up that way.
[55:58.73]Wait, steam.
[56:01.46]It's right on me!
[56:05.06]Dude, what the fuck?
[56:11.33]Okay, that was fucking comical.
[56:13.42]Alright, I'll agree with you.
[56:15.82]That was pretty comical.
[56:31.27]Fuck.
[56:32.63]Oh, fuck.
[56:35.09]Oh, fuck!
[56:36.65]Okay, I gotta chill.
[56:37.97]I thought I was... I had like a huge adrenaline dump when I pressed that button.
[56:43.32]That's the issue.
[56:44.78]When I got in there after going through all that.
[56:46.89]Press that button.
[56:47.71]No, you have 30 seconds.
[56:49.07]I did an adrenaline dump.
[56:51.89]It dumped.
[56:54.42]And then it was like, wait, no, bro, you gotta turn that fucking adrenaline faucet back on.
[57:11.02]I'm gonna grab that, okay.
[57:13.06]Alright, I'm almost there.
[57:26.94]I need items, dude!
[57:28.22]Oh, my fucking plan just didn't work!
[57:31.85]My crazy plan!
[57:35.87]I was so confident!
[57:38.37]My confidence has been shattered!
[58:01.99]I need a good amount of items.
[58:04.41]We're doing a bunch of rebarbs, you know the deal.
[58:08.86]Oh, come on.
[58:09.56]That's fucking dog shit.
[58:14.85]Dude, stop that dog shit!
[58:17.92]The fucking lip!
[58:33.63]That's such a bad place for that to be.
[58:40.94]Oh, come on, dude.
[58:41.83]Don't you dare.
[58:43.71]That's such a shitty place for that to be.
[59:03.48]Alright, come on.
[59:09.62]I need items.
[59:11.45]Uh, mods, when we get down, when that guy gets down to one minute, make sure, snooze the ads when it gets down to one minute, please.
[59:18.37]I don't have time to take a break right now.
[59:20.01]Two rebarbs, great.
[59:21.70]Perfect.
[59:25.14]One of these, I need like four of those.
[59:28.42]I need a lot of those.
[59:30.78]Uh, give me that too.
[59:32.96]Give me this.
[59:33.71]Give me this.
[59:39.77]Okay.
[59:41.44]I'm going.
[59:41.92]I'm going.
[59:42.46]I'm going.
[59:42.96]Jesus.
[59:53.63]Okay.
[59:54.97]I gotta give myself the best opportunity here.
[59:57.10]Whew.
[60:00.77]I'm going for a fucking dickhead play here and I have to hit it.
[60:05.16]I'm going to hit the first button and then we have to land these two shots.
[60:18.64]Almost just fell to my death.
[60:20.60]Alright, everybody chill.
[60:22.72]I'm slowing it down.
[60:51.63]Why was there no drop on that one?
[60:56.34]But the one I threw before dropped like a fucking stone.
[61:12.30]Is that gonna just go straight?
[61:15.81]If I do it right there, is this gonna land?
[61:20.01]Is that gonna land if I do it right there?
[61:21.59]A bit up a little bit.
[61:59.80]Dude no come on what the fuck I was so slow.
[62:22.72]Oh my god.
[62:23.66]This is impossible ah
[62:28.71]I tried!
[62:29.73]The jump just... I couldn't jump.
[62:32.20]I was... Ster's here right now.
[62:35.86]Ster, what the fuck is up with this section?
[62:38.07]I did the elevator part.
[62:39.21]Elevator breaks again.
[62:40.35]Joe, fix it.
[62:41.15]Elevator breaks again.
[62:41.95]Throwing those rebarbs.
[62:48.84]I... Dude, what the fuck?
[63:07.41]And then I had to change my plan.
[63:08.69]I had an adrenaline dump.
[63:17.04]Complains to his boyfriend when the game does him dirty.
[63:21.23]Oh, I gotta take a break.

[67:18.86]And it's fucking great.
[67:22.18]I love it.
[67:25.73]I love, especially, when you think you beat Act Two like three different fucking times, but then the game decides, no, Patrick, no, you didn't actually.
[67:39.54]You gotta do a bunch of bullshit, Patrick.
[67:45.65]I almost just fell down.
[67:49.37]Okay, let me start over.
[67:52.51]Grab a fucking box.
[68:00.34]That was such a... I'm so fucking defeated.
[68:17.43]Hit the third button first?
[68:20.32]Yeah, I... I guess, because... Yeah, that makes sense.
[68:24.71]I can't believe I have to do more of that stupid shit.
[68:28.73]Oh, that stinks.
[68:32.28]Oh, man.
[68:32.94]And look at how small these jumps are now.
[68:35.08]I had all the cool perks.
[68:37.41]I gotta do the whole fucking thing over again.
[68:39.29]Ugh.
[68:47.23]Oops.
[68:50.50]Hey, you got this, queen.
[68:53.34]Hey, thank you.
[68:59.65]Oh, man.
[69:01.19]I don't even... Guys, it was such a... It was such a traumatizing experience.
[69:05.34]I don't even remember what happens after you press the button in the elevator.
[69:09.89]It's just... It's gone.
[69:11.57]I don't even know what you do.
[69:13.96]I remember climbing.
[69:19.61]I remember climbing.
[69:31.31]He's already repressed it.
[69:34.75]That's fucking hard, man.
[69:36.40]That sucks.
[69:40.26]They do so dirty at the end there.
[70:01.25]Hmm.
[70:04.87]Other way.
[70:09.00]Update how to bro you game at for a living.
[70:12.14]How do you suck?
[70:14.62]Vandalism facility property is strictly prohibited.
[70:18.19]I mean for a living.
[70:23.31]I don't think I, but the last time I gained for a living is when.
[70:27.23]I was going to shoot mania storm tournament in like 2012.
[70:32.99]And that wasn't even for a living.
[70:34.61]I only got that because, like, Ster was good at the game.
[70:54.03]And I'll tell you, a chatter that just said that.
[70:56.27]Let me tell you, man.
[70:57.85]This game does you dirty, okay?
[71:00.12]This game's fucking rough.
[71:18.89]This game needs work.
[71:21.51]No.
[71:22.35]Actually, not really.
[71:24.02]That's the thing.
[71:39.81]I think the book is out if I like the fact that you start over from Act 1 every time.
[71:46.86]I don't know if I'd love it.
[71:49.82]I don't know.
[71:50.36]I don't know how much I love that.
[71:53.31]But it is part of the whole experience.
[72:01.23]You could just cheat.
[72:02.29]Well, then I'm cheating the game then.
[72:06.62]You get a respawn.
[72:08.88]I would like to be able to buy more respawns, right?
[72:11.96]Make it have it cost money.
[72:13.52]So if you're on like a really good runner, you get really confident.
[72:17.47]I would love to be able to buy more discs.
[72:36.65]No, with the bug money, not real money.
[72:54.47]Because then I would really be looking out to get as many bugs as I could get.
[73:03.46]Because bugs are great.
[73:06.70]But you can only really buy one item from a vending machine, right?
[73:10.13]Oh, fuck.
[73:11.47]That's not good.
[73:12.01]Hold on.
[73:26.95]Don't want to lose right here.
[73:46.61]I think he's addicted.
[73:50.02]Could we use more fall jokes?
[73:51.56]You got the ultimate.
[73:52.98]I feel like there's at least three or four times in this stream where you couldn't have asked for a better setup for what happened after the setup.
[74:04.16]It was like textbook funny guy falls on a live stream game.
[74:08.85]Do you know what I mean?
[74:10.29]I don't think I could have asked for it to be better that way, but fuck this game.
[74:19.08]This is really stupid what I'm about to do.
[74:46.27]Wait, did it decay?
[74:48.85]Oh shit, what was it before?
[74:49.93]A 9.5?
[74:50.37]There's been a little decay.
[74:54.50]Guys, there's been a little bit of decay, I think.
[75:08.41]Uh oh.
[75:08.65]Hold on, we'll find out.
[75:10.48]We'll find out what's in this machine.
[75:12.48]There's been a little decay.
[75:18.67]That's amazing, but I have to really just... I have to just... I gotta go so fast.
[75:29.72]Somebody just said, Jesus Christ, I got to Act 3.
[75:31.98]Good luck.
[75:38.23]Well, considering you started that with a Jesus Christ, and then you said good luck after it.
[75:48.05]This is purely an act two streamer.
[75:53.47]That's true.
[75:54.07]Alright, I gotta just go for it.
[75:55.72]Just do it.
[75:58.56]Give me one of these.
[75:59.60]Those things are amazing.
[76:01.38]And give me one of these too.
[76:02.26]I don't care.
[76:02.60]I gotta get... I'm playing to win this time.
[76:04.35]You know what I mean?
[76:05.95]I gotta play to win.
[76:10.19]Alright, move.
[76:10.71]Let's go.
[76:11.12]I only got a few minutes.
[76:21.68]That is not playing to win.
[77:03.21]I'm doing like Al Pacino sounds.
[77:08.16]Hey, that's me, Al Pacino.
[77:11.54]Whoa.
[77:13.23]What do we got going here?
[77:15.01]We've got, oh, wow, we got White Knuckle.
[77:18.24]White Knuckle is my favorite game, I think.
[77:20.42]Wow, whoo.
[77:32.87]It's not Al anymore.
[77:34.74]It's Dunk.
[77:39.44]I forget there was so much product placement in that fucking movie.
[77:52.20]What's my name?
[77:53.68]Dunkachino.
[77:56.14]Say it again.
[77:57.32]Oh, Dunkadunkadunkadunka.
[78:04.75]What the fuck, dude?
[78:16.03]Come on!
[78:19.17]Come on!
[78:22.15]Alert.
[78:22.87]Containment breach in Bio-Research Lab 5.
[78:26.78]Do not approach the lab to proper clearance.
[78:34.38]Alright, we made it.
[78:35.53]Bro, there was a disk on the floor.
[78:38.09]I wasn't even fucking looking.
[78:47.92]I think he's drunk.
[78:51.35]I don't think I could play this game drunk.
[78:53.71]I don't think that would work very well.
[78:57.47]And okay, let me tell you this too.
[78:58.95]Let me tell you something.
[78:59.97]Listen to me.
[79:01.35]The fact that act one to go up after you complete it is that easy compared to how insanely hard act two's difficulty spike post-completing act is.
[79:12.76]That's a huge spike.
[79:14.07]I would expect that in like act six.
[79:20.35]Pressure sealed engaged.
[79:23.23]Door latches all holding.
[79:25.76]Noble
[79:32.21]Okay.
[79:34.10]Let's get the disk.
[79:37.89]Perks.
[79:38.77]What do we got?
[79:43.72]Um... I mean, it's this one.
[79:50.13]It's that one.
[79:50.97]It just is.
[79:58.17]I gotta, I gotta hurry up though.
[80:00.37]Because how many minutes do I have left on my other thing that I have?
[80:13.85]You got way too much in your inventory?
[80:18.96]Chat is so mean.
[80:22.73]Yeah fine, everyone's fine.
[80:25.20]Don't worry.
[80:25.84]The person that said, hey, dude, you suck at this game.
[80:28.85]I don't care.
[80:29.53]You know, that person is stuck in Act 1.
[80:31.57]And they're looking over seeing me at Act 2+.
[80:36.44]And they're like, hey, fuck this guy.
[80:37.94]I can watch this.
[80:38.64]I'm going to make him fucking hate himself.
[80:44.79]I do have so much shit.
[80:47.39]That guy's going to link his progress in the Discord and be like, he's a fucking idiot.
[80:50.94]Look, I already beat the game five times.
[80:56.57]Uh, I have so many items.
[81:00.34]Alright, alright, everybody chill.
[81:03.64]Let's go.
[81:04.04]You ready?
[81:06.34]I have so many items.
[81:07.14]There's no way I don't fucking beat it, right?
[81:08.74]Go.
[81:09.48]Here we go.

[82:10.14]This seed is fucked up.
[82:16.48]Look at how fucked up this seed is!
[82:28.44]I got so many items, we're good.
[82:53.85]Fucking more goopy guys.
[83:03.41]What, was he dead?
[83:04.15]That was almost a disaster.
[83:10.32]I got a goopy guy seed and it's not good.
[83:26.96]No, I got plenty of items.
[83:36.18]I'm good.
[83:46.37]You idiot!
[83:55.41]No, don't.
[83:55.97]I don't need it.

[83:58.86]Put it away.
[83:59.12]I don't need it.
[84:07.69]I don't need it.
[84:09.43]I don't need it.
[84:13.29]I don't need it.
[84:17.46]I definitely don't need it.
[84:18.60]What's going on with the SpongeBob shit today?
[84:22.72]What's up with that?
[84:30.70]Alright, this one, this is, I don't like this level very much, but we can just go for it.
[84:38.09]I know what I gotta do.
[84:43.88]A lot of these things, um... This is gonna be annoying, but let's go.
[84:49.24]Oh, fucking come on.
[84:52.51]How did it not jump?
[84:54.27]I just, it didn't register that I jumped on the edge.
[85:11.13]You can die!
[85:14.46]Is it dead?
[85:15.56]Alright, come on.
[85:16.76]I gotta go.

[85:35.30]Sweaty hands.
[85:51.16]Get away from me!
[85:58.43]Lot of these bugs too.

[86:55.77]Why are there so many of these little shit bugs in this one?
[87:28.02]Fuck that.
[87:31.41]I gotta go.
[87:44.61]Come on, heal, heal, heal, heal, HEAL!
[87:52.90]NO!
[87:53.32]What the fuck?
[87:55.66]You gotta be kidding me.
[87:56.78]Why did it not click?
[88:01.73]Why did it not click?
[88:02.80]I clicked it and I was just barely out of reach.
[88:04.90]Why?
[88:05.10]I felt like it was moving so fucking fast that time.
[88:11.57]Oh, my items are gone.
[88:12.79]Oh, that sucks too.
[88:13.79]Can I say that?
[88:18.08]Should you really lose every single item when you respawn?
[88:27.08]I mean, you only get to restart one time.
[88:40.08]I can't keep my inventory that I had?
[88:41.87]I'm screwed?
[88:53.36]You keep panicking.
[88:54.72]I mean, I really didn't panic there.
[88:56.16]It's just... I didn't grab it.
[88:58.29]I guess I... You gotta move quick, man.
[89:01.03]That thing is right behind me.
[89:04.21]This game is fucking hard, man.
[89:06.42]Like, really fucking hard.

[89:22.92]With like a hundred bugs.
[89:25.55]Oh my fucking god.
[89:49.27]I need more items.
[89:51.41]I did not want to do that.
[89:53.07]Oh my God.
[89:54.27]He's crashing out.
[90:12.04]It's so fucking annoying.

[99:14.12]I don't know where to go.
[99:17.30]No, that's actually really fucked up.
[99:20.27]Can I even play this game if that's gonna happen?
[99:24.93]Like, there was nothing wrong with what I was doing.
[99:26.51]I was moving.
[99:27.17]I was doing just fine.
[99:29.24]That's so fucking sad.
[99:32.30]Like, I... If you run that back, there was no reason why I wouldn't have clicked.
[99:37.78]Take the USB out and plug it back in?
[99:39.38]That's so fucked!
[99:44.61]That's so... I'm so disappointed right now.

[99:54.34]You can probably hear the... You can probably hear me clicking.
[99:57.30]It's literally like... It just... I wouldn't grab anything.
[100:03.25]That's... I actually am fucking furious right now.
[100:06.63]Like, not even kidding.
[100:09.07]You can hear the USB sound disconnected again.
[100:12.08]What the fuck?!
[100:13.02]Are you kidding me?!
[100:15.60]Dude, I'm fucking... I'm...
[100:21.01]What?!
[100:21.37]I want to smash this mouse.
[100:27.40]You have no idea.
[100:29.58]I want to smash this mouse.
[100:33.74]We heard the USB sound.
[100:35.22]I didn't think you could even hear it that time.
[100:37.68]I want to rip this thing in half.
[100:49.08]You can't.
[100:51.12]That sucks.
[100:53.21]Come on, dude.
[100:57.94]Put it in a different port?
[100:59.70]Dude, what the?
[101:03.55]That was going so well.
[101:06.27]Oh, my God.
[101:07.77]You can't be fucking stupid-ass fucking computers.
[101:12.80]Pieces of fucking dog shit.
[101:15.69]Oh, make sure that this bus is on the right bus.
[101:23.10]Dude, you know what?
[101:28.89]Why?
[101:31.61]It doesn't even make any sense, okay?
[101:37.34]Do I have too many USBs plugged in?
[101:39.84]This computer was expensive, okay?
[101:44.61]Yeah, it's like three and a half, four years old.
[101:46.85]This computer was expensive.
[101:48.96]What do you mean I'm out of bus space?
[101:51.56]What the fuck are you talking about?
[101:54.25]Back when I first started using computers, back in like the fucking 90s, dude, I could have 25 USBs plugged in.
[102:01.82]That thing would get hot, but who gives a fuck it would work?
[102:11.89]They don't make them like they used to.
[102:13.07]I can't fucking believe it, man.
[102:19.18]I am so...
[102:22.57]fucking angry but not even at the game right it's like I'm angry at all these peripherals make sure you got this thing fucking plugged into that thing make sure you got this thing fucking plugged in this thing's plugged in that and I I went so hard to I made a bunch of really great last second plays to get up there and make it work I only had I had no items but didn't matter I was good I was doing it
[102:51.27]I was fucking ready.
[102:57.30]Are we gonna pay out or refund?
[103:01.23]I don't know.
[103:03.78]Is that like an act of God?
[103:05.51]Like, do we pay out acts of God?
[103:18.62]Absolutely.
[103:19.66]I don't know.
[103:20.37]I mean, because that was not out of... And the thing is, I was so sad because people here are like, oh, man, he's not going to fucking be an actor.
[103:29.80]And from the naked eye, that looked like I fucking just, oh, my God, he just can't even click the button.
[103:34.69]What an idiot.
[103:36.23]And that person probably left the stream.
[103:38.05]They probably left the stream while I was like, what the fuck?
[103:40.19]Oh, no, I fucking panicked again.
[103:41.90]They're probably like, yeah, this guy sucks.
[103:45.12]They don't even know the hardships.
[103:53.67]Oh, I'm so sad.
[103:57.40]It's alright.
[104:02.46]It's just a game.
[104:03.55]It's just a game.
[104:05.53]It's just a game.
[104:07.35]Even though that was definitely the run and there was so many fucking cool plays.
[104:11.33]Please report any outages.
[104:19.02]You should just refund it.
[104:20.59]That's an act of God, right?
[104:22.72]That's an active god.
[104:24.48]Defund it.
[104:32.13]Yeah, that wasn't that wasn't because I was bad at the game.
[104:35.22]That was purely based on.
[104:36.58]Then active God.
[104:49.36]I am so fucked up right now.
[104:52.16]Because I'm probably... If Act 2 is like this, there is no way I'm going to be in Act 3.
[104:58.77]But that hurts to get there like I just did and have that happen.
[105:06.70]Which means it could happen again.
[105:08.99]Even after I'm switching USB ports.
[105:11.35]I apparently have too many USB things plugged in.
[105:15.15]And it's the microphone, the keyboard...
[105:21.02]A stream deck.
[105:23.41]And the mouse.
[105:26.07]That's apparently too many things on a motherboard that has been built in the last four years.
[105:39.55]A USB mic?
[105:40.63]No, okay.
[105:41.49]The mic is not a USB.
[105:42.50]The mic... I have it plugged into a interface.
[105:48.66]So technically the interface is the USB.
[105:51.59]The mic is an XLR mic.
[106:03.66]I bet your Ster is laughing his ass off.
[106:07.35]We probably got like a Ster belly laugh out of that.
[106:10.77]I can see him.
[106:11.37]I can just hear him.
[106:27.59]Words just cannot... Words cannot describe how sad that is.
[106:34.04]And words are how you communicate with people.
[106:38.52]We're good.
[106:39.52]Do I need a new computer?
[106:53.08]What even is a good computer nowadays?
[106:59.49]Sounds like it.
[107:01.17]Do I really need to get a new computer?
[107:08.85]I'll get back there.
[107:10.65]I'll get back there.
[107:14.70]Holly just gave me her mouse.
[107:17.02]Here is the problem.
[107:18.37]This is a big issue, though.
[107:21.43]Oh, come on.
[107:23.98]I am used to this mouse.
[107:25.94]If I... Think about it.
[107:26.86]If you put a new mouse on now... I don't know.
[107:30.67]I don't know if that's a good idea.
[107:32.07]I'm not used to that grip.
[107:43.90]grandpa it might be a driver issue I haven't maybe I don't know oh okay I will be to be fair though there was a period I think it's this keyboard that's causing a problem I genuinely do because sometimes this keyboard it's oh it's one of those custom lighting keyboards which got the cool lights
[108:08.13]Sometimes that will just flicker and go back to default.
[108:11.52]Which, let me make a complaint on the entire video game peripheral industry.
[108:18.29]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop having RGB lights
[108:27.91]default to just... They're just on and the fucking lights are just on and they're in a wave pattern.
[108:34.20]Stop doing that.
[108:36.22]Stop doing that.
[108:38.03]Stop doing that.
[108:39.57]Stop doing that.
[108:42.19]Because you have to get their software or go in and disable it permanently or turn... Stop doing that.
[108:48.80]Stop it.
[108:54.81]The default should always be a soft white light.
[109:01.22]That should be the default, not green, orange, red, blue, orange, green, blue.
[109:07.17]Look at this.
[109:07.55]Look how beautiful it is.
[109:09.55]Stop fucking doing that.
[109:12.10]A light, gray or white light as the default.
[109:16.48]When I plug my shit in, I don't want a laser light show on my keyboard that I have to go then download software to change that.
[109:23.99]And then you get the software, and it's another piece of fucking software on your computer that loads up its startup.
[109:30.89]I'm just kind of done with it, man.
[109:33.36]Cut the shit.
[109:35.20]What happened to all my money?
[109:36.74]What happened to my money?
[109:39.57]I spent it?
[109:51.15]Where did I spend that money?
[109:53.24]I had 50 bucks.
[110:00.27]Well, I don't really... Yes, I am keeping all these for the... That was so paranoid.
[110:11.56]Oh, man.
[110:15.37]Well, what's the perk?
[110:19.27]RGB keyboards?
[110:22.17]I just, I just don't, I don't know why everybody's decided to have everything be RGB.
[110:26.96]Everything, when you plug it in.
[110:36.18]It's gonna be this one.
[110:39.32]Buy a key, a key cron.
[110:45.52]Is that a key chrome?
[110:47.71]It's a key chrome.
[110:49.98]Alright, let's go.
[110:50.62]I got a good perk here.
[110:52.35]Let's use it.
[111:16.63]A nice mechanical keyboard is customizable?
[111:22.90]That's true, but I want to be the one that decides what that customization is out of the box.
[111:29.37]I don't want some... I don't want some fucking floor mode.
[111:33.29]You know, floor demo mode, which it feels like a lot of them just are out of the box.
[111:37.66]I don't want the fucking, like, Best Buy counter mode.
[111:41.28]Just make... Just turn it off.
[111:42.91]Let me turn it on.
[112:01.99]Oh, we're getting massive goodies right here.
[112:06.07]Um... Good.
[112:07.29]I have so much of this.
[112:30.96]Dude!
[112:45.25]Oh, look at all these goodies.
[112:51.95]Shit, worst area.
[112:54.72]You know what we gotta do?
[112:56.20]I gotta throw one of my fucking sticks.
[113:18.92]Am I good?
[113:27.73]That guy's in such a shit spot.
[113:40.24]Dude, come on, man.
[113:41.89]Not like this.
[113:43.69]Dude, not like this.
[113:44.71]Come on.
[113:54.32]Good.
[113:55.10]Alright, we're good.
[114:05.36]Alright.
[114:06.79]Yay!
[114:07.49]Dun-dun-dun!
[114:12.10]Dun-dun-dun!
[114:13.92]Dun-dun-dun!
[114:28.31]Okay, I got a sick amount of items.
[114:55.24]Hey, you might have a setting turned on that's messing up the mouse.
[114:57.42]Look for the in the settings.
[114:58.38]It's called mouse sensor.
[115:01.99]Censored.
[115:03.83]Censor.
[115:11.78]Give me a great perk.
[115:16.64]That's good.
[115:19.44]That's alright.
[115:22.53]That's kind of incredible, maybe.
[115:31.27]Chris's reach by 50%.
[115:33.17]Do I want that or do I want speed?
[115:37.78]This is like all my money, but I'll do it.
[115:42.17]That could be... That could be how we win.
[116:05.76]I need to do some roach runs.
[116:08.31]Yeah, I do.
[116:15.84]While I can take it, because I need to pee, I'm going to take a break here.
[116:22.25]I'm going to go pee.
[116:24.01]Be right back.
[116:26.32]Ads will be playing as well, so I'll be back in about two or three minutes.
[119:44.17]What's happening?
[119:58.40]What's up?
[120:00.90]OK, is everybody ready to not?
[120:06.79]Oh man, look at all this shit.
[120:08.11]I gotta get to the end.
[120:11.16]Let me take a look.
[120:13.34]Alright.
[120:14.64]These have to all stay.
[120:16.04]You know that.
[120:18.22]I got ropes.
[120:21.01]That should be good.
[120:25.75]I gotta lock the fucking... I don't need this.
[120:29.62]Am I encumbered?
[120:32.06]I don't think so.
[120:34.12]Alright, and the perk that I just got is... What is it again?
[120:39.66]my reach so I can reach so much further okay that's big big big big big okay this is the one I'm gonna go for it this is actually is the one right now um okay let me just get my shit ready let me wipe my hands let me take a sip of my coffee
[121:25.22]Is this pink?
[121:29.89]Is this pink?
[121:35.64]Is it actually pink?
[121:42.58]I can't tell.
[121:43.35]Maybe not?
[121:46.11]No, it is.
[121:46.67]It is.
[121:47.03]Yeah, it is.
[121:48.77]No, it's not.
[121:50.39]Yeah, okay.
[121:53.02]Here we go.
[122:02.70]I'm gonna be quiet for this.
[122:04.43]Good luck.
[122:53.17]That reach is fucking awesome, by the way.
[122:55.14]Alright, good seeds.
[123:00.91]Come on, good seeds.
[123:34.38]Cool down for a sec.
[123:49.38]Cool down for a sec.
[123:55.21]No bugs.
[123:56.07]Massive.
[123:57.61]Absolutely massive.
[124:16.03]What do you- what do you do?
[124:17.58]What do you do?
[124:52.80]Okay, so far so good.
[125:14.64]Hand wipe.
[125:26.53]Another dog shit one back to back, that's alright.
[125:57.70]Chill, come on, come on.
[126:18.45]Whoa, big!
[126:19.11]That's actually fucking huge.
[126:33.28]Any more bugs?
[126:35.14]No.
[126:50.74]Wait, dude.
[126:52.24]Whoa, no, whoa, whoa, no, no!
[126:54.45]What the fuck?
[126:55.49]Oh, man!
[126:56.25]No!
[126:57.27]What the fuck?
[127:01.38]Dude, fucking... Oh... No... No... How was I going slow?
[127:11.95]I was going so... How is this shit right behind me?
[127:17.06]What the fuck, dude?
[127:18.56]What the fuck?
[127:20.61]What do those bugs do?
[127:24.47]Okay, and wha- I don't see a way to go that way.
[127:27.32]Am I fucking crazy or... I could have just jumped, could I have though?
[127:31.00]I don't... I think I would have bumped into that bug.
[127:35.35]I was trying to like go around him.
[127:39.39]I fucking don't know guys.
[127:41.76]That sucks absolute fucking asshole.
[127:46.18]Fucking random ass fucking bugs.
[127:49.03]Oh my god, I'm getting mad.
[128:01.35]What do those bugs do?
[128:03.55]And why is this not in my hand already?
[128:08.83]That was going so well!
[128:11.52]Dude, I was going so f- Why was that shit right behind me?
[128:13.68]I was going f- I was fucking flying!
[128:18.55]You can jump on them like a trampoline?
[128:21.47]Fuck!
[128:23.61]I don't think I would want to even do that, though.
[128:32.63]Like, literally everything.
[128:33.99]There was almost no mistakes that whole time.
[128:39.32]Oh my god.
[128:39.54]Fucking annoying.
[128:50.64]Dude, that was such a clean run, too.
[128:52.44]And the goo was apparently right fucking behind me.
[128:57.11]You gotta be kidding me.
[129:23.17]You were playing it a little safe.
[129:26.44]That one room confuses me because it wants you to go in there, but then do I have to go around with a stake or something?
[129:35.25]Because I felt like I was like, I didn't really understand what I was supposed to do there.
[129:53.77]What the fuck is going on?
[129:54.91]What?
[129:55.17]Oh my god, dude.
[129:57.15]I was stuck in the wall.
[130:10.93]Your hand went inside the tunnel.
[130:21.24]Lighting in corridor B-12 remains at 64% functionality.
[130:28.93]Please report any outages.
[130:40.11]Now this is going to get ugly in a second here.
[130:45.43]This is going to get ugly.
[130:57.66]Come on, dude.
[130:58.86]This is a fucking disaster.
[131:02.18]No, man.
[131:03.02]Get it.
[131:05.32]The shit is already here.
[131:06.56]Did I take something that made this go faster?
[131:08.57]Oh, fuck.
[131:17.87]I gotta go for it.
[131:25.60]I... I was trying to jump on him.
[131:34.56]God damn.
[131:38.51]It did come... How far do you bounce?
[131:43.87]Wait, that's another dog shit seed.
[131:47.97]Getting two of those rooms back... I think those rooms are the hardest room in the game that I've seen so far.
[131:55.12]You have to crawl around like... You have to Spider-Man around the whole fucking level.
[131:59.57]With bugs everywhere.
[132:00.51]That place sucks absolute balls.
[132:04.82]That place is awful.
[132:06.58]I would rather take a hundred steam rooms than that place once.
[132:19.44]I feel like you gotta go too far in that one.
[132:34.21]Well, that run got fucking annihilated.
[132:52.40]You got lied to?
[132:53.10]You can't bounce on those?
[132:54.64]Wait, really?
[132:56.32]No, nobody lied to me, right?
[132:59.69]It's been two hours and no progress?
[133:03.98]Yeah, you get back-to-back fucking War of the Worlds bug room.
[133:09.49]And it sucks.
[133:10.89]You know, I think it takes too long to go through that.
[133:13.58]That's why the goop is catching up to me, because you've got a Spider-Man across the whole fucking level.
[133:20.29]I guess I could jump around, but that's so fucking dangerous.
[133:34.24]I'll fucking eat my ass.
[134:04.43]Okay, give me shit
[134:45.11]Well done.
[134:45.96]Thank you.
[134:49.01]Can I stand on this?
[134:55.89]Yeah.
[135:06.07]Hey, at least I got Act 1 pretty much in the bag.
[135:15.16]I don't really have a problem with Act 1 at all anymore.
[135:37.02]More stuff.
[135:38.02]Whoops.
[135:42.33]Dude, if I get climbing speed, then it's happening.
[135:47.58]Just give me climbing speed again.
[136:01.06]No!
[136:03.82]We're good.
[136:18.47]Cool.
[136:24.29]He's got nice porn acting.
[136:27.22]It's funny, anytime I get serious when I'm like, no, oh my, no.
[136:32.02]People go, wow, dude, he's acting.
[136:35.64]And it does kind of sound like that.
[136:37.07]I will say, you're right.
[136:38.37]It does sound like I'm full of shit.
[136:41.77]I definitely am not.
[136:44.71]I'm fucking sad.
[136:52.40]I have five bucks.
[136:53.64]This is fucking disastrous.
[137:00.27]No.
[137:02.67]Oh, eight minutes is not enough time.
[137:11.76]You just acted that force and it was no different than it was before.
[137:20.25]Well, I'm good at replicating something I said.
[137:26.61]The goop has a catch-up mechanic.
[137:27.79]It will travel faster through areas you've cleared.
[137:31.18]Well, I haven't cleared Act 2 yet, apparently.
[137:32.98]Wait, technically did I?
[137:37.99]Have I technically cleared Act 2?
[137:41.73]Does the game think I cleared it?
[137:43.90]And that's why it's going faster now?
[137:46.50]Alright, let's go.
[137:59.55]Need to utilize that.
[138:12.61]Ah, shit.
[138:12.91]Thought I could get it.
[138:14.81]I am definitely gonna have to go on a- what is this?
[138:19.20]Blblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblbl
[138:54.36]What's this?
[138:56.92]What the fuck is this?
[138:59.93]What's this?
[139:00.59]Danger?
[139:01.05]This is harder than the fucking normal place!
[139:04.40]What do I do?
[139:16.24]This is different.
[139:30.55]Oh my god, what the hell is this new level?
[139:33.62]Oh, fuck.
[139:36.83]No, no, no.
[139:37.97]Ah!
[140:01.15]Holy shit!
[140:04.07]Oh my god, what do I do?
[140:06.05]This is fucked up.
[140:07.24]I don't know.
[140:07.56]I can't even see.
[140:08.36]Okay, dude.
[140:10.80]The bumps on the fucking walls are... That's stupid.
[140:15.02]It's fucking everything up.
[140:16.41]Like, I keep hitting the lip.
[140:20.45]Those little X bumps?
[140:27.18]I bump into them.
[140:29.58]What the hell was that?
[140:34.51]Okay, well, I've never seen that before.
[140:36.35]That was weird.
[140:42.18]You died, by the way?
[140:42.90]Just letting you know.
[140:43.78]Time that person out for 15 weeks.
[140:51.07]I got Act 1 handled?
[140:53.05]Well, when I go into the wall and it's a completely different level with... Dude, that was fucked up!
[141:01.80]It's so dark in there, too.
[141:02.84]You can't see shit.
[141:14.61]Turn off dithering?
[141:21.24]I guess it kind of helps.
[141:48.74]Well, that's good to know that there's more shit to do, I guess.
[142:00.48]I can do that, right?
[142:03.20]Dammit, come on.
[142:04.33]Yeah, well, let's go this way.
[142:15.22]What the fuck?
[142:28.79]There we go.
[142:53.77]We want dithering.
[142:54.99]We want dithering.
[142:58.49]Dude, sorry.
[143:11.39]Notice climate control systems for deep substructure remains within acceptable parameters.
[143:26.69]Running out of room.
[143:34.13]That way.
[143:40.21]We want dithering.
[143:41.63]We want... We want ice cream.
[143:44.64]We want ice cream.
[143:45.82]It's not like you're in the back of the car.
[144:18.95]Can I pull it out?
[144:20.87]Let me pull it out.
[144:21.69]I didn't want to use it.
[144:22.68]Let me pull that out.
[144:25.94]Fuck, I needed that.
[144:27.36]I was, right when I clicked it, I was like, man, I can't wait to use this in Act 2 when it's necessary.
[144:34.52]We don't need it.
[144:35.02]Items are a crutch.
[144:39.93]Come on, dude.
[144:47.38]I need bugs.
[144:51.55]Dude, how did I end up with six dollars?
[145:04.61]I had fifty and I ended up with six bucks?
[145:09.14]How did that happen?
[145:12.00]What a total disaster.
[145:17.03]Okay, where is the- oh, that way.
[145:26.37]I'm gonna fucking scream.
[145:31.37]You can get- you bump the shit out of the wall and it makes you want to fucking scream.
[145:49.50]How do the words go?
[146:12.82]I want a permanent upgrade.
[146:15.55]You know what?
[146:16.05]I'll say this too.
[146:17.23]I haven't really gotten a decent permanent upgrade.
[146:20.47]It's all been just kind of, you have 10 minutes to fucking run as fast as you fucking can.
[146:27.19]I want permanent upgrades.
[146:32.94]It's a sea of 10 minute Andy bullshit.
[146:42.05]50% more reach?
[146:45.41]Yeah, but I messed that all up.
[146:47.70]Because my computer went... That's like living in my head forever now.
[147:04.46]Shit.
[147:08.09]Really?
[147:08.29]Really?
[147:12.78]I gotta go, come on.
[147:19.39]There we go, I got it back.
[147:23.92]Good.
[147:28.13]Oh boy.
[147:56.16]Hey, it's TikTok.
[148:01.74]Did I just call him TikTok?
[148:07.99]I did.
[148:40.46]Gotta utilize the stamina while I have it.
[148:57.39]Unk is losing it.
[149:04.82]I'm not losing it.
[149:05.64]I'm fine.
[149:08.30]I'm not fine!
[149:25.18]What?
[149:32.89]Oh, come on.
[149:36.11]No, dude.
[149:37.14]What the fuck?
[149:38.90]What the hell?
[149:44.23]And now I gotta turn the fucking fan back on.
[149:46.27]Or climb up the whole thing.
[149:47.47]I can do it.
[149:55.04]No, I can't.
[149:55.68]I'm fucked.
[149:56.68]Mr. G, I'm fucked.
[150:06.71]Aye aye aye.
[150:07.93]What a fucking joke.
[150:14.10]What a fucking joke.
[150:17.38]One little fucking mistake.
[150:19.12]You have to start the entire video game over.
[150:22.03]Don't make any fucking mistakes, or the whole video game needs to start over.
[150:29.07]And it wasn't even a mistake, it was just picking the wrong side.
[150:33.92]Which is a mistake, but fuck off!
[150:45.98]Maybe this game's not for you?
[150:48.40]I've done so well.
[150:51.42]But, I don't know.
[150:58.41]I've heard Act 3 is awful.
[151:03.70]I want to at least get to Act 2 so I can say, hey, that game, that's like almost fucking impossible.
[151:08.62]I at least got to the second act.
[151:16.15]Oh, shit.
[151:16.81]I'm fucked up here.
[151:17.47]Let me go.
[151:21.77]Hey, you ever gonna play The Sims 2 again?
[151:28.56]You almost beat Act 2?
[151:30.52]Yeah, I keep almost beating Act 2, but the game then goes, No, hold on a second.
[151:34.55]You're not quite done.
[151:35.39]Oh, okay.
[151:36.39]Am I done after this?
[151:37.09]Yeah, maybe.
[151:38.43]Am I done after this?
[151:39.17]Nope.
[151:39.65]No, you gotta do this part, too.
[151:41.13]Oh, and it sucks.
[151:42.76]Am I done after that?
[151:43.50]Nope.
[151:43.88]No, you gotta go back out to the fucking elevator.
[151:48.09]Can I be done after that?
[151:48.86]No.
[151:49.44]No, absolutely not.
[151:51.06]You beat Act 2?
[151:51.72]No, you did, but you didn't.
[151:52.76]Fuck you.
[151:55.09]Jump out of the elevator again.
[151:58.66]We know how much you fucking love doing that.
[152:15.18]I think he's honest to God pissed off.
[152:22.03]I'm fucking mad at my computer of all things.
[152:40.42]Can I get up there?
[152:51.24]Why can't I go over here?
[152:51.98]This is different.
[152:59.53]Always gotta blame your tools.
[153:08.21]Yeah, kinda.
[153:23.54]Can you please finish this game already?
[153:26.39]Um, this is one of those games that you're supposed to lose like thousands of times potentially, so you're going to strap in here for a little while.
[153:55.92]That's gotta be a record for Act 1, right?
[154:01.61]Alright, this is the one.
[154:07.14]This is gonna be the one.
[154:12.75]I need rebarbs.
[154:14.97]I'm ready to go.
[154:16.21]Somebody said, hey, just lock in or whatever.
[154:22.64]I'll try.
[154:27.21]Think I'm just going I got 200% climbing speed.
[154:29.69]This is a big deal Alright, let's go
[154:58.63]Hey, I'm back.
[154:59.35]Is he mad yet?
[155:01.47]No, I haven't gotten mad in at least like an hour.
[155:08.94]These bugs are stupid.
[155:11.25]They should be deleted from the game.
[155:31.10]Okay, so that was fucking tricky.
[156:00.58]This one's different and it's harder.
[156:04.06]I think they did make Act 1 harder.
[156:08.19]Anybody read the patch notes?
[156:09.81]Was that on the notes?
[156:24.02]Anybody?
[156:24.30]Was that in the notes?
[156:39.85]What the fuck?
[156:41.75]Why did it let go of the other hand?
[156:43.44]Um, hello?
[157:04.87]You need to stop stressing.
[157:06.55]Dude, I got this entire game is stress.
[157:10.94]Ster told me he said hey dude, but.
[157:13.66]What the hell?
[157:17.09]OK, things are not going well right now.
[157:20.13]OK, we're going to have to just take it.
[157:24.78]The climbing speed is fucking this section all up.
[157:28.93]Ster told me this is one of the most stressful games he's ever played ever.
[157:33.69]The whole game is stress.
[157:39.14]The entire video game is stress.
[157:47.07]We're not baking cookies right now, guys.
[157:49.16]What the fuck is going on here?
[158:06.72]Holy shit.
[158:30.11]I want those items.
[158:34.71]We got... Oh, good.
[158:36.66]Good.
[158:37.16]Look at these goodies.
[158:39.74]Okay, let's continue.
[158:43.00]That was very dumb, but we're okay.
[158:48.43]No, bro.
[158:51.86]They're getting stuck on that lip.
[158:52.90]They gotta fix that.
[158:55.00]Fix that shit.
[158:58.29]Getting stuck on that lip is fucking awful.
[159:03.27]Fix that.
[159:04.67]I was so mad about getting stuck on the lip.
[159:18.07]Okay, there's a lip that's right there that you can't walk over like this.
[159:21.27]You just get stuck.
[159:28.72]I fucked up the whole run.
[159:35.19]Climbing speed's not worth it?
[159:37.16]It is, but you just get stuck on everything.
[159:45.13]What's your current McDonald's order?
[159:48.22]Uh... I don't know.
[159:54.15]Chicken nuggets and fucking Frosty?
[159:56.51]I don't know.
[159:57.29]That's the wrong restaurant.
[160:16.35]I mean, Act 1 was going so well until... I don't know.
[160:18.94]Am I just... Is this game just so brutal that I have fucked my brain up trying to beat that... Dude, you know what?
[160:26.03]Fuck computers.
[160:28.75]I probably actually... If we go back in time, we like run the tape back, I probably beat it when I get to that section with my mouse unplugged.
[160:40.01]Security systems compromised.
[160:40.93]Unauthorized access detected in restricted zones.
[160:45.21]I probably beat it at that point.
[160:51.05]Now every stupid little thing that can go wrong is going wrong and it's ruining every run.
[161:05.58]And am I?
[161:06.96]I might be crazy, but I don't think I am.
[161:09.36]I think, is the goo moving faster now that I've cleared this a few times?
[161:13.20]A bunch of times?
[161:14.47]I feel like it is.
[161:16.85]Oh, that was a fucking stupid idea.
[161:20.77]No?
[161:21.31]Why do I feel like it's going so much faster?
[161:24.66]I'm losing my mind.
[161:34.97]Okay.
[161:50.84]Can I not?
[161:51.67]Wait a second.
[161:53.95]Wait, should I just go this way?
[161:56.55]Secret?
[162:10.54]Don't grab a box.
[162:17.64]Brain is overworking.
[162:24.95]This game's just really hard, man.
[162:28.01]It's really hard and it's really unforgiving.
[162:32.42]It's very, I would say it is exceptionally unforgiving.
[162:43.70]Like the Dark Souls of Climbing games?
[162:52.25]It's even more brutal, because you have to start the whole thing over.
[162:57.28]And if you save the game, you don't keep your items.
[163:00.98]You have to go just fucking nude.
[163:04.15]You literally have to do it nude.
[163:06.15]If you have a save file.
[163:12.22]Like, if I die to Margit in Elden Ring, they don't take all of my equipment.
[163:21.57]Hey, you died to Margit.
[163:23.32]All of your items are in the trash.
[163:54.43]Are you comparing this to Elden Ring?
[163:56.96]Somebody else did.
[163:57.70]I was addressing them.
[164:05.72]I don't need them.
[164:23.57]I'm gonna go outside.
[164:25.96]Isn't there a place to go outside?
[164:29.53]Wait, really?
[164:32.90]Do I have to do this?
[164:56.02]OK, break room again.
[164:57.30]We've seen this a million times.
[165:07.92]OK.
[165:12.44]He's not assessing anymore.
[165:14.53]I don't have an opportunity to assess.
[165:23.20]I can't make assessments.
[165:25.42]Is this harder than Isaac?
[165:40.89]I would say yes, but that's kind of hard to make that comparison because they're very different games.
[165:59.62]Do you have an entire column of rebars?
[166:01.75]I... Trust me, I'm gonna need them.
[166:27.21]Trust me, I'm gonna need all these.
[166:28.40]Oh shit.
[166:42.76]The jump speed is screwing me over.
[166:47.63]But I need it.
[166:57.74]Come on.
[167:02.17]Alright, wipe my hands, and let's go.
[167:17.36]Okay, I gotta turn this on, right?
[167:35.68]Hey, almost there.
[167:38.06]Are there stats to see how many times you've died?
[167:42.86]I think the menu is a stat thing.
[168:27.25]I made it to act two.
[168:37.76]Are we everybody getting hyped?
[168:57.00]You guys didn't, some of you did not like that.
[169:03.36]Is there bugs anywhere?
[169:04.39]I need to do just a bug run.
[169:10.32]I'm almost out of money.
[169:11.08]Pressure seal engaged.
[169:13.96]Door latches all holding.
[169:16.48]No leaks detected.
[169:26.83]Something good.
[169:29.49]That's pretty good.
[169:30.20]Roaches love you.
[169:36.57]What does that do?
[169:41.25]Uhm.
[169:44.34]I don't know.
[169:47.92]More money, I think it's gonna be the first one.
[169:53.71]Three more items you're not going to use.
[169:57.02]Hmm.
[169:59.46]Kind of true.
[170:03.59]I kind of feel like I want this one.
[170:10.36]But this one is probably a little more helpful.
[170:15.34]At least as of right now.
[170:16.32]It's for the steam, yeah.
[170:19.55]I'll take it.
[170:24.91]I have so many items.
[170:26.86]There's no reason to do this right now.
[170:42.87]You have any good sourdough recipes?
[170:44.49]Yep.
[170:45.47]What you do is you get to your kitchen counter and you make a list.
[170:52.36]And on that list you write at the very top, this is ingredient number one, a bag of sourdough.
[170:59.49]And you go to the grocery store and you buy it.
[171:01.61]You buy a bag of it and it's delish.
[171:24.28]OK, I've got two.
[171:27.40]Let me clean this up, because this is if I don't do it this time, I'm going to be fucking sad.
[171:36.35]I'm going to say top row teeth right here.
[171:39.70]Will put up here the two rope ones.
[171:44.64]So we're a little so it's not as crazy.
[171:49.95]That looks good.
[171:51.47]Put the food in the bottom right.
[171:53.77]Get that in queue.
[171:56.67]Okay.
[171:57.84]Fuck.
[172:00.14]I gotta pee.
[172:02.44]I'm gonna pee.
[172:02.82]I'll be back.
[172:04.02]I'm gonna run.
[172:05.48]We'll take the break now.
[172:12.57]Hopefully this is the run.
[172:14.13]If it is, then GG.
[172:15.25]If it's not, then it's too bad.
[172:17.44]But you know, it is what it is.
[172:19.42]We're back.
[175:32.39]Alright.
[175:33.88]I'm back.
[175:37.04]I'm back.
[175:37.40]I'm good.
[175:39.22]I had a dark orange piss.
[175:42.58]So I made sure to drink a little bit of water.
[175:43.97]You know, get myself situated.
[175:47.67]And we're good to go.
[175:49.11]Okay.
[175:52.23]What do I have for perks?
[175:57.86]This is all I have right now.
[175:59.30]I don't have extra speed.
[176:00.26]I don't have extra jumps.
[176:01.38]I got nothing.
[176:04.09]I'm just going to play.
[176:05.05]Let's go.
[176:05.67]Warning.
[176:11.82]Severe elevator malfunction detected.
[176:15.00]Avoid elevators until further notice.
[176:18.89]Emergency evacuation route through drainage system has been opened.
[176:34.43]Good seed, no bugs.
[177:04.84]What does it say?
[177:06.10]Who cares?
[177:06.48]No, don't you dare.
[177:35.01]I had to get rid of one of those.
[177:35.97]They were wearing me down.
[177:36.99]Itchy nose.
[178:00.72]Yikes.
[178:05.33]Oh.
[178:05.83]It's the hottest room in the entire room.
[178:14.21]Checking our items.
[178:54.17]Good, I'll take it.
[179:13.94]Okay, look at that steam.
[179:20.73]Get your ass up there!
[179:26.57]Elevator access to sub-level 7 remains operational.
[179:32.41]Proceed with caution.
[179:49.13]Fuck!
[179:49.75]Can I grab it from here?
[179:50.85]Can I grab it from here?
[179:55.42]Yes!
[180:12.99]I just thought, I just, hold on.
[180:15.31]I just saw like somebody in chat and like on their computer going like, yeah, yeah, yeah, fuck you.
[180:20.80]I could just see them and like it freaked me out.
[180:23.46]Reminder, all gate valves must remain sealed until official flood protocol is declared by the local authorities.
[181:15.94]Why can't I grab it?
[181:58.26]No.
[182:15.46]Nooooooo!
[182:28.62]Get me away from you.
[182:32.72]Come on.
[182:44.59]What the fuck just happened?
[182:46.44]What the fuck, dude?
[182:48.86]What?
[182:50.22]My head got wedged.
[182:51.54]Dude, what?
[182:55.50]My head got stuck in the fucking wedge and it shoved me down 100 miles per hour.
[183:02.64]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[183:06.53]No way, dude.
[183:08.07]No way.
[183:10.67]No way.
[183:12.39]That just like shouldn't be possible.
[183:17.18]That's, dude, I was right there.
[183:19.46]Like, God, what the fuck is this game?
[183:24.40]My head was like wedged in and I was like, wait, what?
[183:27.57]So I... Everything was going so well too.
[183:37.89]That's such shit.
[183:43.52]Like that is such shit and we all know it.
[183:46.73]It's such shit.
[183:51.88]Like a little narrow fucking thing for your head to get stuck in.
[184:01.16]And now I got no items.
[184:03.75]And I gotta get...
[184:17.73]We need a motivational talk radio?
[184:20.05]Dude, I don't... Oh, fuck.
[184:24.84]Losing all your items sucks.
[184:26.46]That's terrible.
[184:47.33]Because now, even if I get back there, I don't have anything.
[184:58.35]Do one little thing to get your head stuck in.
[185:01.69]Delete the whole run.
[185:17.45]Oh my fucking god.
[185:18.81]I felt like that was gonna be the one too.
[185:24.12]Oh my fucking god.
[185:35.63]You don't need items, you got this?
[185:38.81]I mean, it's just like, it just takes all the wind out of your sails.
[185:43.00]I was collecting items, I'm getting ready, I want to do this.
[185:47.12]It's all gone.
[185:47.98]But I'm still here.
[185:49.77]I'm still here.
[185:51.21]I still have to do all this after collecting all my bullshit.
[186:01.00]Seeing that empty ass inventory in Act 2 is like, dude, I'm fucking, I should be dead.
[186:19.53]Fuck.
[186:20.13]This is a fucking disaster.
[186:21.98]This is the- Hold on.
[186:23.54]Spawn- Spawn fucking ten bugs.
[186:41.99]You better not fuck with me.
[186:46.47]Do you keep your upgrade after you revive?
[186:48.35]I think you do.
[186:50.23]That would be 10 times worse if you didn't.
[187:01.87]This is not gonna work out.
[187:03.33]I gotta fucking go.
[187:05.95]Oh, this was a mistake.
[187:07.19]It sure was.
[187:07.77]I gotta fucking make it work.
[187:13.78]Okay, no food either.
[187:15.51]Shit!
[187:25.55]Somebody said stop jumping?
[187:26.69]Yeah, that's easier said than done when you fucking have to go up against a clock and you got one way to go and then you jam your fucking head into a wedge!
[187:38.16]This shit's already here, guys.
[187:40.58]What the fu- I'm telling you, this shit's going faster!
[188:03.33]No, dude, I don't.
[188:05.50]I don't like that.
[188:07.26]I don't like that.
[188:10.07]The like launch yourself over the if you if you're near a lip, it just throws you back 100 feet.
[188:16.47]I don't like that.
[188:33.69]Where do I want to go from here?
[188:36.09]Up there?
[188:37.94]Fuck, hold on.
[188:38.64]I'm... Where's the... That way.
[188:43.75]Come on, let go.
[188:45.29]Oh, I'm fucked here.
[188:52.00]Oh, I'm fucked.
[188:53.57]Oh, I'm fucked.
[188:56.03]Oh, I'm fucked.
[189:00.86]Oh, I'm fucked.
[189:01.78]I'm fucked.
[189:02.18]I don't have any food.
[189:03.08]I have no food!
[189:14.55]Get this fucking lip out of the game!
[189:55.89]Getting stuck on shit sucks.
[189:57.96]I'm just saying it.
[189:58.62]Getting stuck sucks.
[190:01.05]If there's a lip to get fucking stuck on, like...
[190:26.30]Bro needs to go bush mode?
[190:27.70]Dude, I don't know what the fuck I gotta do right now.
[190:33.39]I gotta fucking burn my mouse.
[190:36.53]In a fucking, like, seance.
[190:40.68]Because I would have been done with this shit two hours ago.
[191:10.71]Can I make that?
[191:11.69]I don't think so.
[191:14.74]No.
[191:17.70]You gotta go big mode?
[191:19.92]Dude, I need to just get... I just keep getting so fucked over by all the littlest stupidest shit.
[191:28.51]It's like the little tiny dog shit that you can have happen to you.
[191:32.96]Standard operating hours remain suspended.
[191:37.76]So you get in a flow, and then that flow is interrupted because you run into a fucking lip wall.
[191:43.45]And then it's like your timing is all off.
[191:47.82]It makes you want to fucking puke.
[192:14.16]Did you do cheers to you?
[192:15.17]I can't do cheers to you unless I get to a point where I- and I can't even turn it on because there's no place to stop!
[192:44.03]This isn't an online game.
[192:59.99]You can pause it.
[193:01.83]Yeah, but when you're in a flow, you don't want to just pause in the middle of your flow.
[193:10.59]Am I on this?
[193:19.86]You know, fucking whatever.
[193:39.50]I need these.
[193:40.18]Uh, I gotta go back.
[193:48.41]Still weighed down by... Okay.
[193:55.90]You need the positive affirmations guy.
[194:00.44]Just do little fucking things.
[194:01.84]Just keep fucking up every single time I try to play.
[194:05.45]Just little dumb things.
[194:07.03]I will scale the whole mountain.
[194:09.95]And then some little fucking stupid thing happens.
[194:14.17]And then the whole thing's over.
[194:18.02]One stable energy signature is detected in experimental sector.
[194:23.40]All one authorized exploration.
[194:54.74]I got money.
[195:01.63]How we doing?
[195:03.87]I got plenty of these.
[195:04.81]Is this the mad streamer?
[195:16.93]I don't know if I'm mad.
[195:17.83]I'm I would say infuriated.
[195:22.97]It's a little different.
[195:27.97]Shit, these both kind of suck.
[195:51.14]I'll do the stamina might as well.
[195:57.27]Speed is not good, but it's okay.
[196:08.27]Oh well, killed him.
[196:12.03]Can we get some epic parkour music?
[196:13.66]Yeah, sure.
[196:18.05]Let me just get this going.
[196:25.11]I think this is probably the most epic parkour music you could get.
[196:27.59]Let me just put my impossible to put in headphones.
[196:40.43]You know, the ones that have to go around your ear and then stick through and then dig into your fucking ear canal and then they don't even stay in there.
[196:48.18]The technology was so much better.
[196:51.30]before I mice... fucking unplugged.
[196:56.43]Parkour music, let's go!
[196:57.75]Ow!
[197:22.69]Okay.
[197:48.67]Standard operating hours remain suspended.
[197:53.22]All services are on indefinite standby.
[198:02.60]This is fucking with me.
[198:21.55]Fuckin' computers!
[198:33.65]Oh shit!
[198:57.46]Dude, what is this?
[199:00.42]This is not Mario.
[199:05.47]Here we go.
[199:17.52]No, I don't want to do this one.
[199:21.37]This one sucks.
[199:22.51]This part sucks.
[199:24.11]I don't want to do this, Mario.
[199:25.70]This is impossible.
[199:28.73]Okay.
[199:30.05]And three, two, one.
[199:36.94]This is fucking stupid.
[199:39.46]This is stupid.
[199:41.13]This game's too hard.
[199:42.49]I think the game's too hard.
[199:44.01]The game's too hard.
[199:46.25]The game's way too fucking hard.
[199:49.30]This game is too hard.
[200:04.38]The game is a 10 out of 10 hard.
[200:08.71]There's been a little bit of decay of my score.
[200:13.06]Oh, come on.
[200:19.35]Dude, you can't put that over there and have it be like, go over there.
[200:22.35]Fuck, dude.
[200:23.09]I don't know the timings.
[200:25.86]I was in a fucking flow.
[200:28.00]Oh.
[200:38.42]This music is making them angry.
[200:40.66]Why is it making you angry?
[200:42.17]Hey, we got cold bushes in the fridge?
[200:49.54]No, no, no, no.
[200:50.78]I'm not breaking out any bushes for this.
[200:59.22]Yeah, this music's fucked up.
[201:02.14]I'm skipping ahead.
[201:09.61]Alright, here we go.
[201:15.33]Alright, here we go, guys.
[201:16.27]Ready?
[201:16.50]Three, two, one.
[202:10.61]Get out of the fucking way!
[202:40.53]Reminder.
[202:48.29]Emergency evacuation protocols remain disabled.
[202:53.22]Proceed at your own risk.
[203:06.06]Phew!
[203:19.22]Phew!
[203:34.14]Phew!
[203:35.02]I don't fucking want an ad for Overwatch!
[203:40.28]No!
[203:41.48]This is like a licensed song!
[203:45.07]You're fucking me up!
[203:46.39]This is not Overwatch.
[203:47.53]It's a different game.
[203:52.47]I can't turn it off.
[204:03.46]No!
[204:05.70]Hey!
[204:34.57]I don't remember this song being this long.
[204:39.97]Oh, fuck!
[204:41.56]Oh, mama mia!
[204:44.20]Mama mia!
[204:46.70]Wahoo!
[204:58.22]Hey, Luigi!
[204:59.54]Watch this!
[205:02.46]Yeah, oh let's go oh
[205:43.89]Freeze.
[206:10.25]That's good.
[206:11.81]That's.
[206:13.22]Oh, it's gotta be this, right?
[206:14.58]It has to be this.
[206:26.38]You get three cocktails here and the cocktails are like the best item in the whole game.
[206:37.86]Free up some space.
[206:39.54]Because these things are insane.
[206:46.00]Seriously, best item in the whole game.
[206:52.53]I think we might actually get through this with the power of Super Mario.
[206:55.31]Somebody's ResidentSleeper.
[206:58.32]Alright, dude.
[206:59.16]Okay, what do you want me to do?
[207:02.22]Alright, what do you want me to do?
[207:03.60]What do you want me to do to wake you up?
[207:04.82]What do you want me to do?
[207:06.97]Whatever it is, I'm probably going to keep doing this.
[207:11.83]Maybe they're just tired.
[207:16.04]Oh, okay.
[207:17.66]Okay, getting rid of that.
[207:18.80]I have so many rebars.
[207:21.67]I'm ready.
[207:22.75]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[207:25.37]I got good items.
[207:26.68]We're going to use climbing power.
[207:34.49]You guys ready?
[207:35.79]I'm just going to zone out and listen to Super Mario.
[207:42.19]Overhead lighting in training chamber 47 is partially operational.
[207:47.86]Illumination devices recommended.
[208:58.36]What the fuck?
[209:09.73]How do I get up here?
[209:10.33]What the fuck?
[209:10.93]I gotta throw a barb.
[209:22.53]Shit, my pants.
[209:29.31]What's next?
[209:34.44]I don't... Shut the fuck up, please!
[209:43.24]Yeah!
[209:51.13]Oh, please don't kill me.
[209:54.13]Please don't kill me.
[209:58.30]Please don't kill me.
[210:00.50]Holy fuck, that grazed me.
[210:06.01]My hand!
[210:11.48]My hand!
[210:30.46]We should totally play Kirby after this.
[211:12.95]Holy shit, a fucking radio!
[211:15.34]Whatever it is.
[211:22.74]Why can't I go that way?
[211:23.66]I don't care.
[211:43.41]I made you a cake.
[211:45.10]A chocolate cake.
[212:00.29]I don't have jump speed right now.
[212:06.42]Alright, Steris said something yesterday or the day before.
[212:09.89]He said he's actually really good at playing the game.
[212:12.03]He's actually exceptional.
[212:13.10]He's very, very good at it.
[212:14.90]The problem is he plays like somebody is holding a gun to his head.
[212:19.85]And my response to that is this.
[212:22.66]This game is stressful.
[212:24.28]Pressure seal engaged.
[212:27.07]Door latches holding.
[212:35.59]Drive!
[212:36.45]Okay, okay, man, okay!
[212:38.93]Should I go left?
[212:39.97]Left!
[212:40.48]Okay, left, left, left, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[212:42.60]And punch it!
[212:43.56]Okay, punching it, punching it, I think.
[212:45.52]So, what's got you in town?
[212:48.84]I have a disk.
[212:51.79]What does this do?
[212:54.99]What is this disk?
[212:58.55]Todd stuff?
[213:01.30]Todd Journal?
[213:04.48]first day thing have been going a little dual wow hope to just got my position assigned by the sp-17 director exciting stuff looks like I'll be a surveyor in the deep facility from what I understand even research team still has no idea how deep it goes
[213:24.90]Okay.
[213:26.34]Can't believe this place is real.
[213:27.96]When it even had P10.
[213:32.25]Gets disclosed to the new public, whatever.
[213:34.23]Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[213:35.83]Was given a camera by my supervisor and a sector locator to start out with.
[213:41.94]They want me to begin with the superstructure drainage lines.
[213:45.09]From what I gathered, east of the main culverts have been mapped.
[213:48.61]There's a lot of side tunnels.
[213:51.05]Mm-hmm.
[213:51.17]So I'll just take some personal photo I'll be storing here, okay?
[213:56.86]So what is this?
[214:02.20]The fuck is this for?
[214:07.95]Does this show me a secret or something?
[214:14.82]So I can just ride over this.
[214:16.88]Alright, something huge.
[214:23.47]None of these are huge.
[214:28.62]Probably this first one.
[214:41.46]I have the three drinks.
[214:42.66]I'm going to take this.
[214:52.26]Save on this disk and don't buy a new one.
[214:58.17]Why not?
[215:01.28]Don't buy a new one?
[215:07.81]Don't listen to that guy?
[215:11.19]Saves money.
[215:13.30]No, no, get another.
[215:14.05]He's trolling.
[215:15.17]Save twice?
[215:15.71]That strat is only if you're good enough to get to Act 3.
[215:19.11]So I do this one.
[215:20.65]Format this disk.
[215:22.89]This is a save.
[215:27.46]You can buy a new one when you respawn.
[215:28.94]It's so you don't spend money if you win.
[215:31.30]Oh, we ain't doing that.
[215:34.47]So I could get another one.
[215:36.47]So I don't need to buy it right now.
[215:38.89]I could do it after.
[215:41.77]Just in case I might run into an item that I really need.
[215:46.96]Okay.
[215:48.58]Alright, um... Let me get this clean.
[215:55.09]I got a ton of rebars for the... You know what?
[216:01.79]I got a rope rebar.
[216:03.78]I'm ready.
[216:05.02]And I'm gonna fucking freak out.
[216:07.34]And we're gonna get Mario on the line.. Mario, are you there?
[216:14.46]Are you ready to play your music so I can just zone out and win?
[216:20.82]Okie dokie.
[216:22.32]Ah, you heard it right from Mario's mouth himself.
[216:25.29]Here we go.
[216:39.55]Bomb.
[217:08.22]I have any food?
[217:09.08]I need food.
[217:34.97]No, please!
[217:40.72]It's fucking ruining everything!
[217:46.71]I already went to college!
[217:50.13]I don't need this!
[217:53.24]Ooh!
[218:10.12]Not good enough, not good enough, not good enough.
[218:49.68]Come on, Mario!
[219:16.51]That fucking lip!
[219:17.94]Did you see what happens with the lip?
[219:19.19]It sucks!
[219:21.99]Time to drink.
[219:59.89]Watch out for that lip!
[220:04.04]Oh, mama mia!
[220:14.10]I don't give a fuck.
[220:33.14]Dude, this buff is lasting so long!
[220:35.90]It's amazing.
[220:44.46]This one- There's so many bugs!
[220:47.12]There's too many bugs!
[220:52.65]Get away from me!
[220:57.24]No!
[221:06.62]Oh, you piece of shit!
[221:21.09]I don't like this music, it stresses me out!
[221:22.93]When I was a kid, I used to play this game, and it was Mario Land 2 on the Game Boy.
[221:27.72]And I fucking hate this game!
[221:28.98]It used to freak me out, I used to lose at the fucking second level with the boat!
[221:33.50]I hated this game!
[221:34.54]And it's bringing back fucked up memories!
[221:41.48]Come on, go!
[221:49.87]It's all bad!
[221:51.56]No, guys!
[221:52.56]What the fuck?
[221:54.22]Why was it right?
[221:55.26]Dude, come on!
[221:56.62]Oh my god, it's so hard!
[222:01.11]Dude, to like stay that locked in, and I was doing so well, things were going so well, to just miss one little grab.
[222:09.42]It's over!
[222:11.13]Oh, fuck me.
[222:12.81]That music cursed you.
[222:17.46]Oh, I know it was fine.
[222:19.32]It's just like you don't you let go one tenth of a second too early and it's over.
[222:28.73]Fuck.
[222:34.78]The whole thing is over.
[222:40.32]Oh, it sucks and all my items are gone!
[222:42.89]It's just such- it takes the wind out of your sails so fucking hard!
[222:56.53]You know, it's like that- you hold left click, you right- hold right click to let go of- it's just one little- and I was playing that so well.
[223:09.21]It's like your hand gets tired after a while.
[223:13.34]Open the item box?
[223:18.37]Oh fuck.
[223:22.17]These things can go from so normally well to just so, just the whole runs over.
[223:32.13]I played that very well.
[223:38.46]It's just the last second.
[223:40.84]One tiny little, like, oop, you didn't grab that.
[223:43.49]Game over.
[223:46.95]Oh, fuck me.
[223:47.84]Come on, dude.
[223:52.38]It's like, at some point, like, my hand actually locks up and it starts to, like, hurt.
[224:14.20]It's like the lactic acid to my fingers are just kind of like, I can't hold my hand that long.
[224:24.81]And you saw that shit was right up my ass.
[224:26.51]I had no time to stop.
[224:31.94]Honestly, I think the five bugs fucked it.
[224:34.74]I think there was like five or six of those bugs that spawned and I had to deal with them.
[224:54.90]I need items.
[224:55.66]I can't just run through this.
[225:07.13]Oh, would you just fucking stop spawning these?
[225:09.15]They're fucking so lame.

[242:33.95]Off the ledge is safe.
[242:35.53]Don't explore.

[242:45.79]Wow.
[242:46.77]Sleeping pods must be vacated by 0700 hours.
[242:51.59]Dude, I just locked in and I just was following Geno through the woods.
[242:57.04]That's all I was doing.
[242:59.41]He guided me the correct way.
[243:06.80]I have no money.
[243:14.55]What we got for perks?
[243:20.52]What a fucking string of emotions.
[243:22.50]I was so bad 20 minutes ago.
[243:26.19]This game is so this games too hard.
[243:29.27]But it's very good.
[243:30.81]This game is so fun.
[243:32.11]It's just too hard.
[243:33.68]But hey, get good.
[243:41.63]Alright.
[243:44.37]Are there many more bugs?
[243:49.02]So if Act 3 is that much harder than Act 2.
[243:53.33]Boys and girls.
[243:55.83]I'm OK taking the silver medal.
[243:57.87]I don't care.
[243:59.54]I'll take the silver medal.
[244:00.52]Is this a flare gun?
[244:07.43]What is all this?
[244:09.29]Are these bullets?
[244:10.47]Oh, they're flares.
[244:18.13]Hey, don't give up.
[244:20.57]I'm not giving up.
[244:21.33]I'm just saying that I'm happy with... Ever since I got to the end of Act 2 and failed like seven times, there has been... Like, my poops have been bad.
[244:32.39]Do you know what I mean?
[244:35.30]Like, my things have not been going well.
[244:44.93]Yeah, I've been kind of constipated ever since that.
[244:48.11]Now I can finally take a massive fucking dump later.
[244:50.47]It's going to be awesome.
[244:55.98]It's going to be such a healthy fucking dump.
[244:58.46]You have no idea.
[245:01.31]Thanks for sharing.
[245:02.15]Yeah, thanks for listening.
[245:08.54]That's good.
[245:12.03]What the fuck is this thing?
[245:13.43]Why can't I just have this?
[245:15.81]This is all keep, it's a perk and it's 10 bucks?
[245:20.90]That's too expensive.
[245:22.85]10 cookie bugs to keep your items?
[245:36.13]I mean, it's gonna be this.
[245:44.11]Uh, I got a break to take.
[245:45.45]I'm gonna take it.
[245:47.19]Uh, somebody said there should be stuff up here.
[245:49.09]Like bugs?
[245:49.95]Oh, there's items too.
[245:56.66]Uh, nothing up there.
[246:05.41]I hope you know that this is Act 2.
[246:09.21]No, it is not.
[246:09.69]This is Act 3.
[246:15.82]I got a lot of stuff, though.
[246:18.22]What do I not need?
[246:21.82]I'll figure it out when I get back.
[246:26.55]This is Act 2.
[246:30.79]What?
[246:34.34]Act 1 was the thing I just did?
[246:36.10]No, this is 3.
[246:39.23]Alright, beer beat.
[250:47.28]we doing oh man it feels good I wanted to beat that so bad you have no idea alright time to update my score there was a little bit of decay uh when I had my crash out about 45 minutes ago it decayed down to like a 9.1
[251:16.14]And after I just beat that, the goo was at the bridge.
[251:19.61]I really didn't think I made it.
[251:22.47]Tears were about to stream down my face.
[251:27.18]But after getting that, dude, if you go back and watch that, that goo is touching my heels as I'm about to jump.
[251:36.54]But after jumping there and making it and getting over here, it's increased.
[251:40.81]It was a 9.1.
[251:41.33]Now it's a 9.3.
[251:43.71]It went up 0.2 points.
[251:46.03]It's kind of edging over towards 9.4.
[251:47.81]It's where we're currently at right now.
[252:01.51]You feel better after the massive dump?
[252:04.43]Yeah, that added some points.
[252:07.10]I was finally able to go to the bathroom.
[252:08.64]So, yeah, it's a 9.4.
[252:09.63]That's .1.
[252:10.19]Alright, so... I don't have enough money to save it.
[252:23.81]Let me... This inventory is a disaster, dude.
[252:30.26]What the fuck?
[252:30.56]The best part about playing a game like this is now that I did that, that was my goal.
[252:34.76]Now I don't care.
[252:37.02]I could lose in 10 seconds and I'd be like, nice, and I would just do another run for fun.
[252:43.53]I do want to do some bug runs.
[252:48.43]Should I get rid of a brick?
[252:57.08]Okay.
[252:58.00]I don't have enough money to save.
[253:03.81]I don't.
[253:04.59]I have like five.
[253:07.45]High five.
[253:08.31]Unless somebody said I missed a few bugs outside.
[253:11.87]Did you grab the ones upstairs?
[253:14.35]Let me see.
[253:15.30]I don't think there's any up here.
[253:20.12]Is Stirr proud of me?
[253:22.60]Stirr told me that if I beat Act 1, he'd say, like, Vince McMahon.
[253:26.67]Like, hmm.
[253:27.89]If I beat Act 2, Vince McMahon is like, whoa!
[253:31.95]If I beat Act 3, Vince McMahon is like, eyes are open, his feet are backwards, and he's falling over in the chair!
[253:37.38]Where am I on that scale, for sure?
[253:42.97]Load the gun, it's not loaded.
[253:48.80]You fucking liar.
[253:54.24]Why did you lie to me?
[253:57.98]What the fuck you?
[253:59.25]I probably need these.
[254:00.49]Okay, well now I have plenty of weight.
[254:05.21]Why did you fall for that?
[254:06.21]I don't know.
[254:06.69]I feel like people saw how much I fucking crashed out and got through Act 2 that they'd help me.
[254:12.54]Alright, let's see what it is.
[254:13.46]I'm going for it.
[254:14.26]Whatever.
[254:16.27]What is Act 3?
[254:17.39]Oh.
[254:18.77]This is going to be terrible.
[254:23.72]Okay.
[254:26.64]So.
[254:28.13]Interesting.
[254:28.87]At least they light up.
[254:33.19]Oh, it just stays on.
[254:37.18]Let's go.
[254:47.71]Habitation service shaft.
[254:53.74]Guess we're going up.
[255:04.53]Shit.
[255:11.67]Uh-huh.
[255:26.59]What the hell's going on?
[255:29.96]What the fuck?
[255:31.38]What do I do?
[255:32.40]Um, what?
[255:35.80]Is the goo going to kill me?
[255:38.42]Dude, the goo is going to kill me.
[255:39.94]Oh, wait, I can go down.
[255:44.77]No, I don't want to go down.
[255:51.29]I could go this way.
[255:54.78]There's no more goo?
[255:57.52]That's the greatest sentence I think I've heard anybody say this month.
[256:02.96]Um, shit, I kinda fucked up.
[256:06.51]I guess I could go down there.
[256:07.43]Hmm.
[256:16.04]Should I go down?
[256:17.55]I guess I'm gonna go down.
[256:35.79]There's a long... Look at that.
[256:36.73]That can go down really far.
[256:38.51]Maybe you have to kind of go down.
[256:44.38]Am I insane?
[256:45.00]No, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[256:49.42]Uh, okay.
[256:52.60]Alright.
[257:01.61]Teeth.
[257:03.00]Yeah, but what is that...
[257:05.55]What do I do?
[257:07.28]Didn't look like there was a way to go.
[257:19.39]Was there no way to go?
[257:30.14]Is there a way to go in there?
[257:32.34]Stay in the main shaft.
[257:34.26]Like this one?
[257:43.37]Oh, wait a minute.
[257:44.19]Can I go?
[257:44.61]This is not right.
[257:59.93]Um.
[258:02.96]I feel like I have to go down, but people are saying up.
[258:05.70]That's not the main one.
[258:10.05]Was it down there?
[258:11.95]Like in there?
[258:14.25]Look up, you ding-dong.
[258:15.63]I can't get up there.
[258:16.99]There's no way for me to get up there.
[258:18.22]I don't have any... I don't have any fucking... I don't have anything.
[258:22.50]You can get up there.
[258:23.40]I can't get up there.
[258:24.08]I can't do it.
[258:24.60]Look.
[258:27.06]I can't do it.
[258:33.77]Holy fucking moly.
[258:35.47]Okay.
[258:42.75]Reinforcement systems activating.
[258:48.50]Dude, what the fuck?
[258:49.30]I can't do this.
[258:53.71]How am I supposed to do this?
[258:54.89]Alert.
[258:56.13]Air recycling units in residential corridor six require emergency maintenance.
[259:01.80]I'm dead.
[259:02.54]Reduced oxygen flow may occur temporarily.
[259:16.81]Guys, I don't want to blow this.
[259:18.13]I'm trying.
[259:22.12]I wish I had a rebarb or something.
[259:24.32]I threw it.
[259:24.76]I thought I had... Whatever.
[259:30.80]You can grab the yellow part of the wall.
[259:35.01]But still, though.
[259:50.69]So I couldn't.
[259:51.52]OK, I get it.
[259:53.82]I kind of had the right idea.
[259:54.75]How did I do that before?
[260:19.28]Fuck, I can't see.
[260:20.50]Fuck, I can't see.
[260:21.48]Oh, shit.
[260:25.07]This is bad.
[260:25.77]I can't see anything.
[260:27.41]I have to fall.
[260:28.82]I gotta try again.
[260:30.72]Fuck.
[260:32.50]I gotta try again.
[260:34.83]This is such a coward move, but guys, I can't see.
[260:37.37]I can't.
[260:52.99]Okay.
[261:15.21]Shit, shit, shit.
[261:16.59]Can I sit on this?
[261:18.37]If I don't move, I can.
[261:20.35]Okay, I'm gonna go up this way.
[261:23.65]Good.
[261:24.25]Okay, up.
[261:27.74]Okay, let's sit here for a sec.
[261:35.81]What's the best way to go?
[261:37.92]Right here?
[261:38.34]Thank God there's no goop.
[261:42.02]I know, honestly, dude.
[261:43.62]Can I even make that?
[261:46.01]I can't.
[261:46.55]I have to go back this way.
[261:49.91]I gotta go that way.
[261:52.80]Fuck.
[261:54.20]Can I even get over there?
[261:57.05]Can I grab that?
[262:01.24]Okay.
[262:16.34]I think I have to go around and then up.
[262:18.08]Can I go up from here?
[262:18.88]Kind of, but it's risky.
[262:23.17]Fuck, I'll do it.
[262:30.69]That was very stupid, but I'm okay.
[262:37.96]I can jump to that and then hold on.
[262:40.32]Let's assess it.
[262:40.94]Hold on.
[262:42.40]I can stand on that, I think.
[262:44.01]But if I can't stand on that,
[262:47.00]Then I'm going to go.
[262:49.23]Up there.
[262:57.56]You do have a flare gun.
[262:59.64]Maybe I'll... Okay, I'm going to shoot a flare.
[263:14.37]Okay.
[263:14.55]Okay.
[263:20.21]What the fuck was that?
[263:22.16]Huh?
[263:22.26]What?
[263:22.38]What was that?
[263:27.92]Whatever it is, I need to stop for a sec.
[263:30.41]What was that?
[263:38.26]What do I do?
[263:49.61]Okay, I think I need... There's air in here.
[263:56.54]Can I open this?
[263:58.08]Dude, there's a safe spot right here.
[263:59.93]Oh, please don't do that to me.
[264:03.01]Get in.
[264:10.61]Where is he?
[264:16.57]It's on me!
[264:17.16]It's on me!
[264:17.58]It's on me!
[264:18.32]It's on me!
[264:19.32]It's on me!
[264:23.91]What the fuck?
[264:24.71]Get- This doesn't fucking- Ooh!
[264:40.47]They added a mon- No goop, but now there's a monster.
[264:44.28]You gotta be shitting me, guys.
[264:47.29]You gotta be shitting me.
[264:54.70]What's the point of this?
[264:58.48]Oh my fucking god.
[264:59.54]I got a fucking flare with your name on it.
[265:14.78]Piece of shit.
[265:21.10]Sonny, put the light in the hammer spot.
[265:49.46]Fuck you!
[266:01.00]Is he dead?
[266:05.67]What the fuck are you supposed to do if you don't...
[266:34.12]Nice!
[266:34.74]That's gonna make me get me go far.
[266:38.49]Actually kind of helped.
[266:50.86]Let me get a PB, come on.
[267:01.29]Oh fuck.
[267:11.33]There's gotta be a bullet somewhere, right?
[267:15.02]What do I do about it?
[267:16.04]What do I do?
[267:17.96]What do you do if he's on you like this?
[267:31.09]You have to throw bricks?
[267:37.02]Where am I?
[267:41.79]I thought it was like flares only.
[267:43.33]Am I back at?
[267:43.92]Oh, this is act two.
[267:47.86]OK, well that was weird.
[267:48.98]So there's a monster that shows up sometimes you can either.
[267:51.83]Is it just light that gets rid of him?
[268:01.77]You could have stayed in the vents.
[268:03.87]Are you safe from the monster on the vents?
[268:08.05]The darkness hands are from the torch and throw bricks at him.
[268:12.27]Oh, I... I thought the bricks... I mean, to me, the bricks were a little too physical.
[268:18.24]Not, you know, ethereal.
[268:21.91]See what I mean?
[268:23.89]Uh, I got no money.
[268:25.86]And we are back at Act 2, but that's crazy.
[268:30.72]It's a tricky timing, but if you press E at the right time, you can make out with it.
[268:35.37]Alright, well, whatever.
[268:35.87]Let's go.
[268:41.38]You didn't get the box?
[268:42.74]Oh yeah, you're right.
[268:43.90]It's alright.
[268:47.13]So no goop, but scary monster.
[268:51.69]Good to know.
[268:55.66]I'm alright with doing some bug runs though.
[269:12.88]I'm actually getting some stuff.
[269:14.91]I am so fulfilled right now.
[269:16.15]You have no idea.
[269:17.21]I don't even care.
[269:17.75]It was like, oh shit, scary monster.
[269:19.35]I don't even care.
[269:21.29]This is great.
[269:22.12]I'm having so much fun now.
[269:26.10]I tell you, I'm going for the silver medal.
[269:28.82]Who cares about the gold medal?
[269:29.89]I'm going for silver.
[269:30.75]I already got it.
[269:31.91]I was already at the podium.
[269:45.45]Remember how mad I used to get at these bugs?
[269:47.24]Now I'm, like, happy to see them.
[269:49.17]Hey, Jerry!
[269:51.48]Yeah, I'm doing another run.
[269:52.36]Yeah.
[269:54.63]Die!
[270:19.35]It's like seeing the Tree Sentinel on a new run.
[270:21.94]It kind of is.
[270:22.56]That does suck that you can't keep any of your items though.
[270:30.43]Especially if you have to go, okay.
[270:32.78]Having to go through all these acts again.
[270:36.83]I guess if you have a save point, but you'll start at act two or wherever where I just was.
[270:53.73]I do want more bugs.
[270:56.97]We have to go on a strict money run coming up after this.
[271:03.92]Can I just... No, I don't have any jump.
[271:13.41]Your other save... Yeah, I didn't have enough money to do the other save.
[271:20.95]Unfortunately, it was eight cookie bugs.
[271:37.37]Star said if I beat Act 3, I will be his hero.
[271:42.96]I'm imagining that probably means that Act 3 is very hard.
[271:50.53]Oh, perfect.
[271:53.65]Perfect little heap of cookie bugs right there.
[271:59.54]Scream if you see a machine, because all I care about is depositing these.
[272:12.13]Is it border?
[272:12.91]Ah, it's too late.
[272:21.04]It's too late, but it's all good.
[272:30.53]Hey, remember when I was here like an hour ago and I was like, no, my hands!
[272:34.27]My hands hurt!
[272:36.19]No!
[272:37.03]Oh my gosh, my hand hurts!
[272:40.38]Look at how far we've come.
[272:47.57]What am I supposed to do?
[272:48.39]My hand hurts.
[272:50.85]Actually, though, it did.
[272:56.67]I'm not kidding around.
[272:58.37]It did.
[273:02.32]The goo is already here.
[273:03.50]What the heck is happening in this fucking run?
[273:18.79]No!
[273:27.33]You always have more time than you think, it just catches up to you quickly.
[273:30.10]What on Earth is this?
[273:31.34]This is brand- okay, this is new.
[273:33.58]Crazy.
[273:35.00]I'm trying to flower.
[273:37.89]Weird, okay.
[273:39.77]Should I... go this way?
[273:45.55]Holy fuck.
[273:48.16]I like this room way better because that was cool.
[273:53.85]I prefer this over the... Get that lip out of here.
[273:59.55]Get that lip out of here.
[274:13.01]Is the audio lagging?
[274:15.97]It shouldn't be.
[274:27.62]Come on, dude.
[274:41.58]Oh, yeah.
[274:42.66]Oh, yeah.
[274:47.54]Dude, remember when I put on Geno's theme and I made it?
[274:51.57]I do.
[275:01.94]I'll tell you, I had to beat it there.
[275:04.09]I had to beat Act 2 there.
[275:06.27]Because losing... What was that?
[275:08.83]New tech.
[275:12.80]Losing there would have taken a toll.
[275:15.33]It would have.
[275:19.93]That was like putting on cheers to you.
[275:21.06]It would have taken a toll.
[275:31.22]I think one more and we're good.
[275:35.47]You'll never be able to play Super Mario RPG without thinking about this moment.
[275:38.97]I don't know, maybe.
[275:40.04]This is a new room, too.
[275:41.62]Ooh, this is exactly what I wanted.
[275:47.39]Good, okay.
[275:49.29]Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um.
[275:53.66]Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um.
[275:54.56]Over here.
[276:00.60]No!
[276:01.42]We're good.
[276:01.72]What is that?
[276:12.60]Oh!
[276:19.58]Too bad.
[276:21.15]Greed killed the run.
[276:26.77]New unlocks.
[276:28.70]New pipeworks content.
[276:30.88]New silos content.
[276:33.02]Flare gun added to vendor.
[276:34.49]Flares added to vendors.
[276:35.57]Is there a reason to have flares besides for the Act 3?
[276:44.88]Not really.
[276:49.89]You can rocket jump with it.
[276:54.34]How high does it go?
[276:55.90]Does it go really high?
[277:00.32]Jerma, I'm off six honey packs right now.
[277:02.60]Help me.
[277:02.93]I don't know what that is.
[277:04.33]Is that like a drug thing or something?
[277:16.39]You don't want to know?

[278:32.65]I don't see any.
[278:38.16]Looking for bugs.

[281:33.13]Pick this up.
[281:33.67]That's how I do mine runs.
[281:38.78]A lot of people don't know this.
[281:40.64]You can make the jump from here up to here.
[281:43.33]As long as you have a key.
[281:45.69]Whack, whack, whack.
[281:46.67]And you're good to go.
[281:47.61]A lot of people don't know that.

[282:05.43]Update.

[285:55.11]52.
[285:55.49]Wait, what do you?
[285:56.67]What does it say?
[285:58.31]Somebody wants me to do a math problem with it.
[285:59.81]I saw I saw 52.
[286:00.55]Let me scroll.
[286:03.42]Was it 52?
[286:04.00]52 times 13 is that 676?
[286:07.26]Just move the decimal point once and then add.
[286:18.52]We got money.
[286:28.99]Okay.
[286:31.85]Ooh.
[286:47.37]Hey, the Wiki wants to know what your favorite food is well.
[286:50.97]Sure.
[286:52.39]That we Buffalo chicken is up there pretty high.
[286:55.76]If it's not Buffalo chicken, then it would be.
[286:59.86]Probably.
[287:00.36]I love salmon.
[287:03.06]I also love pasta.
[287:05.25]I am a massive fan of like a pesto pasta.
[287:09.73]Buffalo chicken is if it's prepared correctly is one of the best foods on Earth.
[287:13.95]Limited blue cheese, banana cream pie, absolutely.
[287:19.57]A good tuna melt is up there too in like the top 10.
[287:27.63]Yeah, I'd say salmon like a good really high quality cooked perfectly to medium salmon fillet.
[287:36.66]With like some risotto on a better risotto or something.
[287:39.11]Oh boy, that's like there's nothing better than that.
[287:43.23]A good cheesesteak.
[287:46.31]I just even thinking about it made me start to salivate.
[287:49.57]What about aspic?
[287:53.91]Damn that person.
[288:04.91]My bank accounts get a little higher.
[288:07.61]We're at 14.
[288:09.85]Brisket.
[288:10.36]I love brisket.
[288:12.38]The thing about brisket, though, is you can have terrible brisket or really good brisket.
[288:17.06]There's no medium, somewhere in the middle brisket.
[288:20.16]It all sucks or is the best brisket you've ever had.
[288:24.70]It's weird.
[288:26.26]You either do it right or you just don't.
[288:32.47]Um, I love chicken cutlets.
[288:35.65]Chicken parm, um, with some, you know, spaghetti or fettuccine or something or, you know, rigatoni.
[288:42.34]A good chicken parm dinner.
[288:43.78]Not, I mean, I love a chicken parm sandwich, but chicken parmesan.
[288:47.35]Uh, chicken piccata.
[288:49.61]Love it.
[288:50.17]It's one of my favorite foods.
[288:52.08]Uh, chicken marsala.
[288:54.22]I love Italian food.
[288:54.96]I also love Greek food too.
[288:57.83]Okay, let's move.
[289:00.39]My head got stuck on the fucking wedge, remember that?
[289:18.74]Oof.
[289:20.58]Let's play now.
[289:33.91]Come on, I can get it.
[289:41.30]Oof.

[290:09.27]Okay.
[290:16.14]What's this way?
[290:20.95]Egress.
[290:22.07]Egress.
[290:33.00]I go, dude.
[290:40.51]Oh, fuck.
[290:41.78]I get it now.
[290:44.22]Make sure you have enough shit.
[290:47.55]Okay, we're gonna go right there.
[290:49.29]We're gonna go right there.
[290:50.87]I'm gonna put this in my pocket and I'm gonna be ready.
[290:56.12]Good.
[290:58.09]Okay, up here.
[290:58.89]Wait, anything?
[291:04.00]I hear crushers, oh booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[291:37.50]Is that going to be enough?
[291:40.38]Yep.
[291:41.46]Okay.
[291:42.35]So, what is that?
[291:44.53]What is this?
[291:46.99]Just something cool?
[291:47.95]Should I leave this?
[291:48.71]I guess I did it.
[291:50.03]I don't know.
[291:50.62]Okay, cool.
[291:53.40]Is that just another way to go?
[291:54.64]Bro.
[291:59.83]Please.
[292:01.91]Get it together here.
[292:19.74]That climbing speed is crazy.
[292:45.73]Okay, dude, you gotta fucking get it together here.
[292:50.80]Get it together!
[292:51.87]Get it together!
[293:10.82]Get it together.
[293:15.09]We're gonna have to go like this.
[293:20.52]Oh, I think I need help here.
[293:22.58]I do.
[293:24.40]Fuck it, just do it.
[293:26.44]We don't got time to mess around here.
[293:37.04]Alright, we're good.
[293:46.37]Bugs?
[293:54.25]I don't see any.
[293:56.21]Bug?
[293:57.57]I got a diamond bug.
[294:00.96]Oh, dude.
[294:01.98]I don't know, bro.
[294:03.89]Man, don't look down there.
[294:06.93]Bruh.
[294:21.83]Throw the chair down there?
[294:23.27]Oh, that would've been sick.
[294:27.89]Should I listen to you?
[294:30.64]What are these worth?
[294:34.36]Ooh, five?
[294:37.12]Excellent.
[294:40.07]Okay, what have we got?
[294:45.97]Massive.
[294:48.96]Good.
[294:51.68]Could be actually amazing, maybe.
[295:00.14]I don't know how good that is, though.
[295:07.19]I got tons of climbing speed.
[295:11.29]Maybe it should be running speed.
[295:16.00]If this is a bug run, yeah.
[295:18.74]Am I confident that I'll get to another machine though?
[295:21.09]I might throw 10 bucks away.
[295:30.92]I think I'll take this.
[295:38.33]It is what it is.
[295:39.12]What are your thoughts on mint chocolate?
[295:40.56]I think it's great.
[295:46.19]Mint chocolate's awesome, man.
[295:52.34]What about cast iron pans?
[295:57.14]They're cool, I guess.
[296:07.82]Alright, well, I don't really have great items.
[296:15.11]I got a lot of food.
[296:22.36]I'm going to take a break.
[296:23.14]This may be the last break of the day.
[296:26.09]I have completed what I wanted to complete in the game so far.
[296:32.80]I'm at a pretty decent stopping point, I think, after doing that.
[296:36.86]But we'll see.
[296:39.67]I definitely want to do at least this one and maybe one more.
[296:45.55]um but yeah tomorrow the plan tomorrow is we're gonna do a bunch of sponsor stuff we actually have a kind of a cool group of dudes uh me Ster poke and Criken are going to play towerborn for a couple days uh only for two hours per day the next two days but we're also gonna uh I'm gonna play Dracula 3. I got Dracula 3 working
[297:13.48]The plan is to, depends on when they want to start.
[297:15.84]If they want to start early, then maybe we'll do the sponsor first.
[297:18.27]But the plan is to stream for like three or four hours and then do the sponsor for a couple hours and end it with that.
[297:24.40]Or maybe start for an hour or two and then move to Dracula.
[297:26.94]So we'll see.
[297:28.62]I'll be right back.
[302:25.42]Hello.
[302:29.34]Should I change the title?
[302:30.60]I mean, I'm not going to be alive for that much longer, but... I feel like I should change the title to... Don't spoil if I beat Act 2 or not.
[302:48.21]What are my thoughts on Luigi?
[302:50.99]Little fucking green dork.
[302:53.62]Is that what his name is?
[302:58.37]I thought it was green Mario.
[303:07.30]I don't know, guys.
[303:09.59]I am flying right now.
[303:11.49]Holy shit.
[303:17.70]Oh my goodness.
[303:19.54]I'm going too fast.
[303:24.82]Oh, yeah, the green overall Mario.
[303:27.29]Um...
[303:31.13]I'm in school.
[303:39.10]I'm glad I've wasted all that time.
[303:49.17]Holy shit.
[303:53.29]Okay, slow it down.
[303:54.39]Slow.
[303:55.17]Slow.

[303:56.78]Slow down.
[304:07.90]Aye!
[304:22.69]Uh-oh!
[304:23.71]Not looking good!
[304:24.51]They were like three of them stuffed in the same spot.
[304:30.54]That was fucking dog shit.
[304:36.06]There was three smushed in that little spot.
[304:41.01]Why can they even spawn in that spot together?
[304:45.66]Why can they even spawn there?
[304:48.65]Back to back like that?
[304:49.83]Dog shit.
[305:06.23]Hold on.
[305:07.31]Wait a minute.

[305:14.64]Hold on.
[305:24.12]Are you going to take a poll from your pen?
[305:25.60]I don't need to write anything down.
[305:30.62]I don't even know if there's ink in my pen.
[305:38.40]Do two times speed music.
[305:41.04]Well, hold on.
[305:41.76]We got to pick a good one.
[305:45.01]How about Rainbow Road?
[305:49.37]That's good.
[305:50.39]I choose Wix for my business because of its math.
[305:54.16]I don't.
[305:54.66]Okay.
[306:01.17]Alright, here we go.

[308:39.67]What?
[308:42.03]What the fuck are these things popping on me?
[308:51.24]Just... Dude, this fucking climbing speed is driving me fucking nuts.
[309:09.00]Thank you.
[309:11.21]Where am I going from here?

[309:52.03]Come on, come on, come on, come on.

[310:04.17]Why does it sound like I fucking got this on my phone in like 2003?
[310:07.49]It's the N64 one?
[310:26.66]I feel like it's going a long time, too.
[310:28.62]Why is it going so long?
[310:36.54]It's like, dude, I don't fucking think I can take this anymore.
[310:40.43]Oh, we gotta go that way.
[310:42.43]This is a good one.
[310:44.45]This is Mario Huy.
[311:15.71]So many of these bugs are in this one.
[311:17.66]It sucks.
[311:20.40]Uh, last one, right?
[311:36.04]See if I can do it again.
[311:36.70]I got no items.

[313:01.17]It actually kind of sounds like the last hour of this stream.
[313:26.78]Such a lot of gear.
[314:05.80]Alright, last one.
[314:06.50]This is the last one of the night.
[314:08.30]I'm gonna make it a good one.
[314:20.56]Oh, I hit that every time.
[314:31.51]Alright, I look like I'm a baby.

[318:18.97]Wowee, wowee!
[318:57.58]I'm trying to be too fancy, but I'm doing well.
[319:20.91]That was Mini-Me from Austin Powers.
[319:46.99]I'm being too fancy!
[319:48.29]I almost didn't grab that.
[320:00.89]Nice.
[320:11.28]Alright, that's a lot of money.
[320:16.86]Backup's almost 30 bucks?
[320:20.36]Hey, dude, remember the deal to shave your head if you... Wait, do you remember our deal to shave my head if you play Kirby Squeak Squad?

[322:36.85]What's going on?
[322:47.73]Oh no... Oh my god!
[323:00.26]Last one for real.

[326:29.91]Now that guy's going to shave his head.
[326:41.66]What should I put on?
[326:46.74]I'm a woman.
[326:48.96]That woman's going to shave her head.
[327:00.27]Put on Ridge Racer.
[327:02.97]What can I put on?
[327:04.21]Pizza Tower.

[330:46.21]Remember how much I would freak out doing this one?
[330:51.40]That was a piece of cake.
[330:53.22]Think about how far we've come.
[330:56.17]In just two streams.
[330:57.59]Thank you.
[331:01.78]What's in here?
[331:02.96]Dude, there's a bowling alley?

[331:56.21]Oh, I gotta go.
[332:06.47]Reactor cooling failure detected.
[332:09.48]Core temperature rising beyond safe limits.
[332:15.46]Slow down.

[332:34.51]Hello.
[332:41.57]Okay, good.

[333:21.69]Is this the last run?
[333:22.80]Uh, probably.
[333:25.18]What am I doing?
[333:41.60]Who cares about the food?
[333:51.65]Whoa!
[333:56.98]Are the Pizza Tower devs making anything else or did they just make like a five million percent banger and just said, fuck it, we're done?
[334:04.54]I mean, that's kind of, that's kind of Gigachad, right?
[334:12.15]Just show up and just make like one of the coolest, most stylized, wacky, fun, fucking crazy games and just be like, fucking who gives a shit, we're done.
[334:28.71]Don't say Giga, Chad.
[334:38.62]Man, you used to be cool.
[334:41.43]I think I've said that probably five to six thousand times.
[334:47.38]Come on, man.
[334:49.44]You use that word IRL?
[334:52.81]You use the word IRL?
[334:56.71]Bro.
[335:07.69]You know the one we're gonna have to put on.
[335:11.36]Where is it?
[335:13.14]It's the crazy one.
[335:20.73]What's it called?
[335:25.07]Pizza time?
[335:27.88]Is it pizza time never ends?
[335:29.88]Or is it just pizza time?
[335:47.16]Where is it?
[335:47.74]I don't see it on this.
[335:50.29]Oh, there we go.
[335:50.93]It's pizza time.
[335:54.43]Alright, there it is.
[335:56.27]Alright, I'll be ready.
[336:05.05]The rules for this last run here is I cannot stop once.
[336:13.02]I can't stop moving.
[336:13.80]I have to keep going.
[336:15.78]Are you sad?
[336:16.44]No, I'm very content right now.
[336:20.75]I'm just tired because I blew out all of my endorphins and adrenaline and everything, beating Act 2.
[336:26.17]And then I'm coming down now.
[336:32.78]This thing is so good.
[336:36.51]I don't want to buy that.
[336:37.51]What do I got right now?
[336:39.21]Double stamina.
[336:41.81]I think I'm going to do this and drink the whiskey, whatever it is.
[336:48.91]Because I have... I have no whiskey.
[336:54.21]I thought I had one.
[336:55.41]I think that was the last run.
[336:56.44]Well, shit.
[336:57.26]Oops.
[336:58.22]Maybe I'll find one.
[337:14.77]One pitton is fucked up.
[337:17.26]Uh, we're kind of going in with nothing.
[337:21.68]But, it is what it is.
[337:23.22]I'm happy.
[337:24.37]I'm content.
[337:25.75]Act 2 has been completed.
[337:28.47]Did he beat Act 2?
[337:29.53]Oh, you got spoiled.
[337:32.64]Alright, here we go.
[337:33.18]Let's crank it.
[337:34.52]Let's have some fun.
[337:35.34]I'm going to crank it right now.
[337:39.38]I'm turning it up.
[337:41.77]Lower your volume if you don't want to hear it.
[337:44.17]It's going up.
[337:57.77]What's going on on on that's a different song what does he say This guy's on me That's what it is, okay
[338:30.28]Bro!
[338:40.28]Dude, fuck these stupid ass bugs, man!
[339:28.09]Right hand's broken.
[339:28.83]Left hand's broken.
[339:30.45]Left hand is broken, I repeat.
[339:32.22]We're good.
[339:42.02]Why is it still on me?
[340:00.40]Dude, this run sucks!
[340:28.94]The clock is ticking.
[340:30.09]Oh, shit!
[340:34.18]I gotta go!
[341:15.30]Get up there!
[341:17.50]Oh, fuck this dumbass flower.
[341:24.81]Watch that lip.
[341:36.19]I thought there were three people standing there.
[342:27.34]I need food.
[343:53.18]I need food so bad!
[344:19.13]No, the music can't end now.
[344:20.31]Something, something, high energy.
[344:24.48]SOMETHING HIGH ENERGY, NO!
[344:26.51]SOMETHING HIGH ENERGY, PLEASE!
[344:29.35]That was, like, a sad song!
[344:32.68]Yeah!
[344:34.01]Alright, come on!
[345:49.46]Let's go!
[346:09.95]I need that hand back!
[346:11.95]Aye!
[346:22.67]Alright, let's go.
[346:38.98]Almost done.
[346:47.51]Dude, this has gotten harder.
[346:59.75]I haven't beaten it yet.
[347:00.59]Don't show me that.
[347:15.01]What the fuck are you talking about?
[347:19.42]What are you talking about?
[347:21.60]I... What, dude?
[347:25.34]What the hell?
[347:29.57]That drops down?
[347:31.05]Oh, that is stupid.
[347:41.84]That drops down.
[347:43.16]It's like a little... Come on, man.
[347:45.62]That was fucked up.
[347:49.29]That was fucked up.
[347:50.41]I'm not going to lie.
[347:52.63]Goes down.
[347:54.79]Dude, I felt like I was climbing for an eternity there.
[347:59.98]That was like 100 years.
[348:01.38]How long was that level?
[348:04.80]Damn.
[348:06.28]I feel like that lasted so much longer.
[348:11.91]What the hell?
[348:15.22]Well, OK.
[348:17.84]That's the first time I've gone through that section like that, but I guess it goes down.
[348:24.61]You got careless.
[348:28.00]I guess maybe a little.
[348:30.76]Uh, this is another fuckface run.
[348:32.26]Uh... Let's put on, like... I don't... What... What game has, like, piano music?
[348:47.91]I'm talking so smooth and relaxing.
[348:57.94]How about Minecraft Ambience?
[349:17.47]What's that song that goes like... Dun, dun, dun.
[349:22.25]Dun, dun, dun.
[349:25.08]Dun, dun, dun.
[349:27.14]I don't care.
[349:33.67]Okay, let's relax to this one.
[349:49.90]Let's go.
[350:09.49]Dude, I'm in the bunker.
[350:10.55]I'm in the Minecraft bunker and shit's not going well.
[350:15.44]You built all this dude?
[350:16.68]Nice.
[350:17.56]This is a really nice build underground.
[350:24.04]What the fuck dude?
[350:26.36]What was that dude?
[350:28.41]What the fuck was that?
[350:36.64]This game has music that's playing at the same time.
[350:42.57]I just realized that.
[351:00.59]I can't whatever you know the joke
[351:27.18]Should add a Minecraft overlay.
[351:30.93]I can't do all that right now.
[351:42.96]This is a sick Minecraft parkour map, though.
[351:46.82]I should have done it.
[351:49.87]I'm not going to let that win.
[351:50.99]I'm getting it.
[352:11.97]Don't ever give up!
[352:14.05]What's this?
[352:25.74]What the hell is this?
[352:35.21]Uh... Okay.
[352:39.90]I thought it was a secret.
[352:54.58]Okay, now we're going to do a Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga battle music extended until I lose.
[353:02.47]And I'm not allowed to stop once.
[353:04.49]I got like 10 minutes to do this.
[353:06.50]Here we go.
[355:17.16]Get that lip out of here!
[355:18.58]Fuck the lips!
[355:20.39]That's not my run!
[356:11.85]Haha.
[356:15.06]Didn't get to end me.
[356:22.88]I win.
[356:26.45]Alright, I'll see you later.
[356:33.68]Somebody said that legit scared the shit out of me.
[356:41.28]Like, what did you think was happening?
[356:45.31]What did you think was happening at that very moment?
[356:47.50]You woke up my dog?
[356:48.58]Well, turn the volume down.
[356:50.20]Why do you want the volume so loud?
[357:06.54]I unlocked a bunch of this shit and I didn't even know.
[357:09.78]Also, how was that not a record ascent?
[357:18.81]I was screaming up that wall.
[357:25.58]Uh, that was very fun.
[357:27.16]I did what I wanted to do.
[357:28.86]Everything else is just icing on the cake.
[357:32.13]I wonder what they really add.
[357:33.53]Here's what I do wonder.
[357:34.43]This is where it's going to get crazy.
[357:36.88]If they're going to add four or five more acts to the game.
[357:42.45]You're going to really start that over from the very beginning if you die in like act six.
[357:47.69]I feel like that's going to be fucking heinous.
[357:55.02]There's a lot more to act three.
[357:59.83]There's going to be a lot more saves.
[358:03.25]There'll be a lot of saves later on.
[358:05.49]Oh.
[358:06.04]It was great.
[358:06.94]I love it.
[358:08.18]I obviously wouldn't have played it as long as I have for the last couple streams.
[358:13.29]I think it's fantastic.
[358:14.48]It's probably one of the more addicting games I've ever played.
[358:18.60]It's super difficult.
[358:19.78]It's really hard.
[358:20.77]It's so punishing.
[358:24.91]It is so punishing.
[358:30.68]But you still kind of want to do it.
[358:32.56]I like want to play it right now.
[358:34.22]I don't want to stop.
[358:36.02]But it's phenomenal.
[358:37.90]I think it's great.
[358:38.99]I think this is probably game of the year.
[358:40.29]Even if it's not even out yet.
[358:44.73]Fuck those lips and those ledges.
[358:47.65]Fuck the bugs.
[358:48.79]All of them.
[358:51.96]Although, you know what?
[358:53.10]Me and the big bug can chill.
[358:54.68]The big bug with the rebar sticking out.
[358:57.66]He's chill.
[358:58.24]I like him.
[359:06.69]How about one more just for old time's sake?
[359:18.79]Yeah, the game's not even done and I think it's more fun than most games I've played this year.
[359:23.00]There you go.
[359:24.14]As frustrating and teeth grinding as it is to do it, the sense of accomplishment that I had after beating Act 2 was unlike anything else.
[359:33.45]So, it's just... Okay, I will say, if you don't like games like this, you shouldn't get it.
[359:41.00]That's the overstatement of the century.
[359:42.67]Okay.
[359:44.23]Good review.
[359:46.13]Anyways...
[359:47.88]I will say, it can get a little tiring on your hand.
[359:51.42]Especially in some of those segments where you really can't let up.
[359:54.39]But that's the way it is.
[359:55.11]You gotta be a fucking gamer.
[359:56.07]You get a gamer glove.
[359:56.92]I might get one.
[360:26.20]Dude, I can just reach this.
[360:37.39]Bro, why are you still on?
[360:39.79]I'm going, I'm going, I'm leaving.
[360:41.10]When I fall- If I fall once, I'm- Oh, the stream's turning off.
[360:54.91]I'm telling you, it's like the most addicting game of the year.
[361:11.50]Critics are saying it's the most addicting game of the year.
[361:33.50]I really messed this one up, didn't I?
[361:39.58]Really messed this one up.
[361:41.21]I don't think I can make it.
[361:46.51]This is an ad break coming up.
[361:52.94]Alright, I have four minutes to turn off the stream.
[362:05.58]Maybe I'll take one more break, come back and finish this one.
[362:09.06]Should I keep playing or anything?
[362:11.39]I fucking love it.
[362:12.41]I'm having fun, man.
[362:21.04]Alright, one more run.
[362:22.04]This is it.
[362:22.64]I'm going to take this break.
[362:23.46]I'll be right back.
[362:36.84]Sorry, that cut me off.
[362:38.07]I was saying, where do I have to be right now?
[362:39.69]It's like 8 o'clock.
[362:41.17]Whatever, I'm fine.
[362:42.53]What have I got going on right now?
[362:45.72]I'll be right back.
[362:47.52]I'll be live until this run is over, maybe.
[362:50.34]Maybe one more after that.
[362:51.08]We'll see.
[366:07.13]I looked over at my, uh, it's a mod channel over here.
[366:11.80]I see, um, all the mods are saying we got another jacket, B, saying we're never getting out of here.
[366:18.55]We're fucking stuck in this basement forever.
[366:21.67]Uh, no music, just a man and his thoughts.
[366:37.94]Alright, doesn't matter.
[366:39.51]This one's just for fun.
[366:41.87]Alright, let's go.
[366:42.61]Whatever.
[366:42.99]Who cares?
[366:43.41]I already beat it.
[366:44.78]I already beat it.
[366:45.58]Don't, um, just don't tell everybody.
[366:48.68]That was such a cool jump.
[366:49.83]I gotta hit that.
[366:53.65]Watch this.
[366:53.95]Ready?
[366:54.27]One.
[366:56.46]Not happening.
[366:57.10]Just move.
[367:19.64]Come on.
[367:20.87]You ain't gonna see that in a Saturday morning cartoon.
[367:23.30]I got new... Get this whip out of my game.
[367:29.02]I got news for you.
[367:53.02]Where's my record?
[367:58.81]Dude!
[368:00.57]Just grab it.
[368:01.57]The lip's gonna keep screwing you over.
[368:08.06]I just hit my face on that.
[368:10.72]That would have made a ping sound effect.
[368:13.30]That was my teeth.
[368:24.53]37 bucks back in it.
[368:27.35]Let's go.
[368:28.07]I have a lot of food.
[368:36.66]That stinks.
[368:41.71]This one was crazy last time, but... Um, whatever.
[368:48.51]Are you tired?
[368:50.19]I'm kind of hungry, but... I did eat earlier this morning, so I'm alright.
[368:54.70]This is probably going to be the last run.
[369:00.11]Whatever happens at the end of this, whatever this whole thing ends, you know.
[369:05.10]Come on, come down here.
[369:07.98]Just crawl down here for one second.
[369:13.91]Fine, I'll go get you.
[369:24.30]Early this morning.
[369:26.44]Well, I've been live for about 6 hours and 10 minutes.
[369:30.59]I started at like 1.30, 2ish.
[369:33.75]I ate like breakfast around 9, 10.
[369:37.55]So, I mean, yeah, it's been a while.
[369:43.18]Alright, we gotta move.
[369:45.22]I've got the climbing speed, but the goo is going way faster.
[369:56.38]That's not the way to do it.
[370:00.08]Just take a second here.
[370:17.31]Careful.
[370:20.59]Rose!
[370:22.55]Rose!
[370:29.30]I gotta rest my left hand for a sec.
[370:37.31]This is not going well at all.
[370:39.50]I'm not.
[370:43.34]OK, um, what the hell was just going on with?
[370:48.97]Was the fan not spinning or the turned off and then turn that was very weird.
[370:53.12]I'm confused.
[371:00.57]That was the last one.
[371:02.19]Uh, no, that one didn't count.
[371:04.05]That was like such a horseshit way to die.
[371:06.86]It turns on and off.
[371:07.82]Did it do that?
[371:08.84]Is that a new unlock that it's doing that now?
[371:10.74]Because I don't remember it doing that.
[371:20.93]And how come there's not in bright green letters when I start a new run that says that?
[371:28.18]It should say in bright green paint on the ground.
[371:31.87]Hey, this is going to turn off and on now.
[371:35.20]In bright green paint.
[372:20.62]Hello?
[372:29.86]Food?
[372:30.46]None!
[372:31.48]How do I not have food?
[372:37.35]Don't you guys think that's kind of messed up?
[372:41.52]I think that's messed up.
[373:11.23]Hey dude, that's not even a time save.
[373:13.74]Ban that person for an hour.
[373:41.17]Somebody who said that?
[373:43.51]I heard somebody said it.
[373:57.37]I heard it.
[373:57.65]Somebody said it.
[374:10.70]so much money dude I can just I can just feel the win on this one I can feel the w you know what I'm saying
[374:40.69]I got so many items, I can definitely do it.
[374:52.28]I didn't think I was gonna grab it!
[375:05.56]I needed to trust myself.
[375:08.45]And I just didn't.
[375:18.35]Alright, good perk.
[375:19.07]Let's go.
[375:19.69]Something good.
[375:21.80]Don't try to get cute with it.
[375:23.18]I know.
[375:28.42]I think this is probably the best one.
[375:30.73]That's the best perk I think I've seen so far.
[375:33.63]It just works.
[375:39.06]Let me get that bug.
[375:42.64]Let me get a chat check here.
[375:44.02]Do I complain about this perk every time I have it?
[375:46.31]I think the answer is yes.
[375:55.22]I killed it.
[375:59.21]Alright, let's go.
[376:07.21]I do want some food.
[376:10.24]I'll take another one of these and you know what?
[376:12.91]Let's go.
[376:34.98]No, I had it.
[376:36.95]Somebody just said it.
[376:37.79]I'm getting cute with it.
[376:41.67]Stop getting cute with it and just go.
[376:43.62]I got the crazy climbing speed.
[376:44.82]Just do it.
[376:45.72]Don't jump.
[376:46.20]Just climb.
[376:50.53]I had to do that.
[376:52.47]Don't get cute with it.
[376:53.16]Just go.
[377:10.54]I want it.
[377:12.58]You know what?
[377:14.60]Let's go this way.
[377:15.84]Fuck it.
[377:37.87]Pretty good time here.
[377:53.59]Should I do this horseshit again?
[377:56.35]Yeah, why not?
[377:56.79]I'm here.
[378:02.90]Ster is here?
[378:03.48]Is he?
[378:10.81]Tell him to get a load of this.
[378:28.26]You need to... This inventory is a fucking mess, first of all.
[378:47.50]Why is this... It is E. Open.
[379:02.91]Oh, boy.
[379:07.36]And... I wasn't feeling it.
[379:39.12]Um, why can't I... Hello?
[379:41.95]What the hell is going on here?
[379:43.81]What happened?
[379:44.94]Am I upside down?
[379:46.78]I'm so confused.
[379:47.58]Where am I?
[379:51.17]Wait.
[379:51.81]Over there.
[379:53.28]Oh, fuck.
[380:13.55]Oh shit.
[380:16.23]Oh shit.
[380:19.41]I can hear the goo.
[380:24.88]Alright.
[380:34.97]Is there?
[380:35.27]What do you think about that one?
[380:56.83]His hero is here and he is nervous.
[380:59.31]Hey, did everybody tell him the news?
[381:08.71]Tell Ster the news.
[381:11.77]What did I do and what does it completing act 2 get me on the frontier list?
[381:19.68]You said don't spoil it for him, oh.
[381:23.35]Well, oops.
[381:30.58]Huge.
[381:33.15]This one's huge.
[381:35.31]Huge.
[381:44.15]I'm so fast now.
[381:47.15]Look at this.
[381:47.53]What a seed.
[381:48.72]Look at these items.
[381:50.10]Unbelievable seed.
[382:02.64]I thought you didn't... He made an exception to spoil it because I am his hero.
[382:10.49]Alright, Ster, you can request one video game song.
[382:14.34]Because this is the last run, so you can request a video game song of your choosing.
[382:19.91]It has to be from a video game, and it has to be sweet.
[382:26.52]Something cool.
[382:39.77]Save the game, I will.
[382:47.80]It's gotta be from a video game.
[383:05.36]Did he leave?
[383:13.50]I'm saved here, right?
[383:16.06]Cuphead Clip Joint Calamity.
[383:21.75]Okay.
[383:30.98]Clip Joint Calamity.
[383:34.11]Oh, is this the one where it goes?
[383:36.41]A brawl is surely brewing.
[383:38.29]And the two frogs are fighting.
[383:54.36]Alright, this one's for you, Ster.
[383:57.24]Take a look at how much I've improved if you've never seen the stream before.
[384:01.37]Let's crank it.
[384:03.51]Here we go.
[384:05.49]Take a look at this improvement.
[384:16.23]What?
[384:42.15]Fuck these bugs.
[384:54.92]Dude, where... Get the fuck out of here!
[385:12.71]How many bugs are in this joint?
[385:15.97]Too many!
[385:17.83]Oh my god.
[385:19.33]Why would I instinctively crush them?
[385:32.35]Dude, this is a fucking joke!
[385:36.49]That's...
[386:23.62]Nice.
[386:56.77]It's the hardest place.
[387:42.52]I thought my house exploded.
[387:51.12]Sir, I need a new song, please.
[388:03.31]We're close.
[388:08.66]It's got to be from a video game and it's got to be a PogChamp.
[388:11.81]Watch my brows go from this to this.
[388:14.35]This was paused.
[388:15.31]Why did I get an ad there?
[388:29.08]Alien hominid invasion map.
[388:33.39]Okay.
[388:43.93]Alien Harmony Division OST map.
[388:51.34]Okay, let's go.
[388:55.21]Bug bullshit.
[389:09.72]You know what?
[389:12.87]Fuck this.
[389:48.85]This guy had the most fucking tongue bugs on a map.
[389:52.06]Period.
[389:52.56]Ever.
[390:17.92]Oh, that's a new record.
[390:21.55]Am I grabbed?
[390:29.84]Come on, I got a new record.
[390:30.93]You're killing me with this nonsense.
[390:32.83]Grab it, you fucking idiot.
[390:57.07]And why can I not get up there?
[390:59.22]What kind of crap is that?
[391:24.47]Come on, do it.
[391:49.20]Climbing speed is so fucking high.
[392:02.63]Nice.
[392:03.73]Alright, this is it.
[392:04.25]This is for all the marbles here.
[392:05.39]Let me get back to Act 3.
[392:08.68]Alright, it's time for a new song.
[392:15.63]First up, let's talk about AI color themes.
[392:18.07]You can get any combos you want.
[392:20.19]Bold and bright, minimalist and sleek.
[392:22.10]I don't, I don't care.
[392:22.62]I gotta go.
[392:22.88]Or something you didn't even think of.
[392:24.72]Just describe the vibe you want.
[392:26.38]Oh my god, fuck off.
[392:36.24]You are en route to habitation.
[392:37.96]I need a new song.
[392:39.74]This is for all the marbles.
[392:49.39]Bring it home song smell of the game.
[392:51.86]Is this from a video game?
[393:01.55]Bring it home song smell of the game.
[393:04.17]What's it from?
[393:10.82]Smell of the game.
[393:11.84]Is there guilty gear?
[393:29.76]Is this the one?
[393:37.01]Alright, I'm cranking it.
[393:38.83]Alright, this is sufficiently cranked.
[393:43.74]Okay, fuck.
[393:45.24]Let me turn it down.
[393:52.49]Alright, I'm ready.
[393:55.90]Alright.
[394:02.62]I wonder what that will look like.
[394:17.64]Body's bullshit blazing.
[394:23.85]Still my heart is blazing.
[394:24.43]If the world can't kill me, I don't need a new life.
[394:41.43]Warning.
[394:43.43]Class 7 fluid has been detected.
[394:47.42]For the safety of Habitation Yellow, your seal mechanisms must be engaged.
[394:55.52]Please contact your local control room specialist.
[395:00.01]Turn it up.
[395:04.85]One more time.
[395:25.85]Turn it up.
[395:29.42]We already know the smell of the game Remember you are blazing, still your heart is blazing If the world's made you, I don't need a new world After you, soon you will know We already know the smell of the game
[396:15.57]I would have 230% climbing speed
[396:40.01]I even recovered it too.
[396:41.23]Dude, when you grab onto shit, when you're going that fast, it's just like... Oh my god.
[396:50.83]Oh, man.
[396:51.95]That was fucking... You know what?
[396:55.95]I could probably jump with the climbing speed, but then I lost confidence and then I... And that's why I fell the first time, but I've recovered.
[397:03.91]Oh, man.
[397:04.47]That was... That was something.
[397:07.29]That was something.
[397:13.00]That corner sucks if you don't... Ugh.
[397:22.89]Oh, man.
[397:23.71]Honestly, too much climbing speed really just kind of kills you.
[397:37.69]Pre-throw the rebar around those edges?
[397:40.17]Yeah, that edge is just fucking miserable.
[397:45.04]And it was freaking me out because I had one hand gripping on one side and I somehow made it all the way around to the other side and it was just... What does that even look like?
[397:54.70]I felt like I was going to fucking fall because I was stretched so far.
[398:07.24]You could easily save the first button rebar.
[398:09.18]Yeah.
[398:10.08]I think the new strat is hit the first button.
[398:13.67]Get the last two.
[398:15.66]Get a rebar on that section.
[398:21.24]Yeah.
[398:25.12]Hey, that was... Whatever.
[398:26.21]I already beat it.
[398:26.93]I already got to Act 3.
[398:30.99]That just wasn't the one.
[398:31.97]But hey, we can do it one more time.
[398:33.21]So I'm going to play... I'm going to put on a good song for me for the final run.
[398:40.78]And I'm going to put on...
[398:48.82]We gotta have to dig deep for this one.
[398:59.89]That's not the song I'm looking for.
[399:13.70]We're gonna go Neverhood.
[399:19.81]I'm going to go rock and roll.
[399:23.13]Rock and roll Dixie.
[399:58.66]Hey, Clayman!
[400:00.32]Say, knock-knock!
[400:03.25]That line from the fucking movie?
[400:14.38]Okay, play the game now.
[400:28.82]What are we gonna get next?
[400:29.64]This is probably a banger.
[400:35.28]Oh ho ho ho ho!
[400:36.29]Yeah, of course it's this one!
[401:00.07]That's not me making these sounds.
[401:34.76]It's the best part.
[401:57.95]What's up with this?
[402:13.51]We need a ladder.
[402:14.93]This is Terry Scott Taylor, if you don't know.
[402:17.38]Legendary.
[402:19.54]This is a Neverhood soundtrack.
[402:21.62]I'll take this one too.
[402:31.65]I need food, I guess I got nothing, damn.
[402:36.05]I'm kinda screwed here.
[402:41.26]Let's see, where do I go?
[402:50.75]Oh, come on, get away.
[402:56.54]Up this way, I think, yep.
[402:59.54]Uh, yeah, this way, for sure.
[403:09.38]That climb speed is too much.
[403:51.42]Who's got me still, him?
[403:53.72]Oh, I've got him.
[403:57.62]This is fucking funny, Smeezer.
[403:59.87]I like this song.
[404:01.71]Another one of these.
[404:07.49]God darn it.
[404:13.30]...detected infiltration 1, 2, and 3.
[404:15.98]Manual cleaning will be required to restore normal flow.
[404:19.51]Actually, I gotta do it.
[404:22.00]We gotta do it.
[404:25.01]I need a good song here.
[404:28.43]That one for sure.
[404:31.90]Yeah, I love this one.
[404:39.65]Uh oh.
[404:44.30]Uh oh.
[405:02.14]Thank you.
[405:26.10]Who's got me?
[405:33.43]Who's got me?
[405:45.62]Play a little ping pong.
[405:47.46]Play a little ding dong.
[405:51.59]I'm actually glad that happened.
[406:05.08]We need a different song?
[406:20.23]Yeah.
[406:26.74]Oh, yep.
[406:29.92]That's a good one.
[406:31.30]This is a good one to end it on.
[406:32.38]I'll get through this.
[407:41.34]Get up there!
[407:42.34]Alright, round two.
[407:53.76]This is it.
[407:54.92]I got nothing.
[407:56.73]I gotta make a plan here.
[408:00.77]Good song to do it on, for sure.
[408:08.61]I didn't...
[408:18.43]This might not be the song, hold on.
[408:40.29]This is a little too comical.
[408:44.87]No, it's got to be something from Skullmonkeys.
[408:59.18]I already know which one it is.
[409:14.03]It's this one here.
[409:15.48]Alright, crank it.
[409:16.32]Relax, everybody.
[409:17.14]Both headphones are going in.
[409:19.18]I ain't fucking this up.
[409:21.36]I'm getting through this.
[409:35.30]This manual override will be required.
[410:00.07]How did it not get hit by the explosion?
[410:09.50]What the fuck?
[410:10.14]It's not dropping, guys.
[410:11.60]It's not dropping at all.
[410:13.23]What happened?
[410:13.99]That's total shit.
[410:45.02]Drop it.
[411:11.94]That sucks absolute balls, dude!
[411:14.86]I got the momentum and everything.
[411:16.49]That's so fucking stupid.
[411:18.83]Why was there no drop at all?
[411:22.35]Did you guys- Go back and watch the last few times I've been here.
[411:25.86]Standing in the same spot.
[411:27.26]That shit didn't dro- There was no drop on the spears.
[411:31.00]Zero.
[411:35.19]Like, what the fuck is the calculation there?
[411:44.66]I threw it in that same spot last time and it dropped a shitload.
[411:48.11]It was like a Call of Duty fucking sniper round.
[411:50.73]And then I throw it right there and there's almost zero drop.
[412:00.54]Zero.
[412:00.94]And even with the explosion, it doesn't even hit.
[412:07.51]What the hell?
[412:12.71]You could have still made it.
[412:13.63]There's a path to the elevator.
[412:14.81]Dude, that wasn't fair.
[412:24.79]Why don't you do one more?
[412:27.20]I don't know what happened.
[412:29.71]Dude, you throw a rebar from the same spot and it drops like fucking 50 feet.
[412:37.88]That same rebar doesn't move an inch on three throws, even with an explosion.
[412:44.78]There was an explosion on the first one.
[412:48.45]It didn't even touch it.
[412:54.74]What's up with that fucking crap?
[412:59.28]I guess you gotta do five more.
[413:03.55]Like, what the hell?
[413:08.51]Dude, even... Okay, on some of those, there was such an enormous drop off on throwing it.
[413:16.57]That I had to compensate even higher than that.
[413:19.97]What is this?
[413:35.68]And it just goes straight like an arrow.
[414:00.33]This is the one?
[414:02.11]I mean, I already did it.
[414:03.41]This is just extra.
[414:09.46]What the fuck?
[414:14.33]I'm so just flabbergasted by this.
[414:16.95]I am just so disheveled right now.
[414:19.90]I can't believe it.
[414:34.07]I'm done.
[414:34.27]Turn your FOV down when you throw bars.
[414:36.59]What?
[414:44.90]I'm going to do a VOD review.
[414:47.43]I want to see what the hell happened there.
[414:48.83]I'm doing a VOD review.
[414:56.88]No drop off.
[414:57.53]What do I, what do I got the, what's like the thing that has no drop off in Battlefield?
[415:02.15]What the hell was I using?
[415:07.23]No, dude.
[415:11.15]I swear to God.
[415:11.47]I swear to God.
[415:12.65]It was so much more drop off the last time I did exactly the same thing.
[415:17.08]Ster said he would coach me.
[415:25.83]Get Ster in the call.
[415:26.57]Ster, you want to get on the call for a second?
[415:28.48]I mean, my stream's turning off in like 10 minutes.
[415:30.50]I want to hear from you.
[415:40.74]The music messed you up?
[415:43.06]That music was a little too chill.
[415:45.17]That's true.
[415:48.97]Let me make sure everybody can hear him.
[415:51.59]I'm going to need to change the setting.
[415:52.69]Hold on.
[415:53.37]Hello?
[415:55.36]Can people hear you?
[415:59.24]Hello?
[416:00.80]Hold on.
[416:03.94]Hello there.
[416:05.41]Hold on.
[416:07.44]Oh, I can hear all the fans.
[416:09.71]Yeah.
[416:10.52]That your chat can't hear.
[416:12.07]That's a lot.
[416:13.63]Hey, alright.
[416:14.33]So, Ster, you're like a master at this game.
[416:16.82]You know a lot about it.
[416:18.52]Mm-hmm.
[416:19.80]I have to ask you a question about bullet drop-off.
[416:23.40]What is the calculation on bullet drop-off?
[416:26.17]Because I threw two identical javelins, and one of them decided to drop off like I was shooting across the map in Counter-Strike, and the other one went straight like an arrow, and it fucked up the whole run.
[416:42.39]What do you have to say?
[416:43.53]Uh... I don't know what to tell you there.
[416:47.12]It's always the same.
[416:48.94]Just gotta aim it.
[416:51.19]There, champ.
[416:52.01]I've been having trouble with them lately myself.
[416:56.48]Alright, well.
[416:57.64]So how do you think I'm doing so far?
[417:00.87]Um...
[417:03.99]This has been like a very fun.
[417:05.81]What do you mean?
[417:07.67]I beat act two for you.
[417:08.94]This is an incredible social, like psychological experiment to like see and feel your internal panic personified through mouse rotations.
[417:20.95]And how quickly you crumble.
[417:23.77]I didn't crumble.
[417:25.03]Like the last run, you fell, right?
[417:26.90]And you grabbed down onto the rebars down at the bottom.
[417:30.54]You just said fuck it and let go when you had already set up pittance to climb back up moments ago.
[417:37.15]You're just like, ah, whatever.
[417:38.37]And I've seen you.
[417:39.23]You died during the sewers like yesterday.
[417:42.34]And then you respawn and you can press the button to go again.
[417:45.24]And then when you just walk off, you're just, you're still mad.
[417:48.23]You don't take a second to think.
[417:49.81]And you just like, you need a cool down period.
[417:53.86]Someone needs to put you on cool down.
[417:55.48]No, I have to go.
[417:57.12]You have to guess the game.
[417:58.07]You gotta go fast.
[418:00.45]um doing better doing a lot better I'm I'm sad you uh not getting to act three consistently well I've been there I've been there once I thought I heard that through your mic it's like you're in a real factory or something you've been there once I've been there once and I saw the monster and it was pretty crazy
[418:22.27]I want you to beat the monster, man.
[418:23.87]I don't know, dude.
[418:25.25]I think you can beat the monster.
[418:27.47]I'm cool with Act 2.
[418:29.34]Act 2 was crazy, and I beat it.
[418:31.46]And it was like, holy shit, what a crazy game.
[418:35.08]I think Act 3, I might lose all my hair.
[418:39.15]Holly, you should have a remote pauser for this game, like a driving instructor.
[418:43.17]Oh my god, it would help you.
[418:44.51]If you could just be told to stop sometimes...
[418:48.29]Alright, are you watching?
[418:49.85]You want to be there for a second?
[418:51.07]Yeah, but I mean, I'm on delay, and I know if you do screen share, your whole computer will shut down.
[418:54.92]That's true.
[418:57.14]Alright, let me ask you a question about some tips here.
[419:01.55]How do you feel about the lips?
[419:04.44]Some of the lips you get stuck on?
[419:06.20]Kissable lips?
[419:07.52]Well, besides that, I'm talking about how do you feel about the lips that you get stuck on?
[419:13.11]I don't know what we're referring to.
[419:14.09]Like when you hit your head?
[419:15.13]Like this.
[419:18.56]ah there's there's like one specific lip that I do I was getting stuck on for a long time I I feel it okay I just want to make sure hear that chat in the the top of one of the sewer areas the big rooms yep oh yeah okay yeah I know hear that this is the this guy has 27 000 points true
[419:48.23]I mean, I wasn't doubting it was ever an issue.
[419:54.28]What am I proving?
[419:55.10]Yeah, like, you see that?
[419:56.54]It's like, yeah, dude, actually, that's kind of hard.
[419:58.72]I finally had a chance to ask God.
[420:00.79]Is it kind of fucked up how I died?
[420:02.09]Right, God?
[420:03.07]Like, I just... I see some validation here.
[420:08.54]Yeah, what would you ask?
[420:09.44]What should I ask?
[420:10.12]Okay, here's what I want to ask.
[420:12.50]um is there ever a reason to let me get to the break room first um okay so the the bomb the bomb javelin the bomb whatever you want to call it yeah is what is the point of that should am I using those effectively just kind of okay I don't want to deal with this um
[420:37.69]I can't believe it didn't hit the fucking elevator button.
[420:42.60]I'm so glad that I already beat Act 2, because if that was like the last time I had gotten there and I hadn't... Hold on.
[420:50.92]If that was a real attempt, not just like, oh, end of the stream, I'm just kind of doing an attempt because I already got there.
[420:57.93]I think I might have quit streaming forever.
[421:00.45]I may have just turned off the stream and quit forever.
[421:02.51]Wait, wait, wait.
[421:04.30]On which run?
[421:04.86]The last one I just did of that one was if I had not beaten Act 2 yet.
[421:10.96]Okay.
[421:11.68]I would have probably just been like, guys, this is not for me.
[421:14.11]Streaming's just kind of not for me, I guess.
[421:17.13]And that would have been the last stream ever.
[421:21.06]That would be kind of fucked up.
[421:23.52]I don't know why I just did that.
[421:26.50]You do not need to nail them in three times.
[421:29.93]Is my pro tip.
[421:30.99]What do you mean?
[421:32.57]so they'll like they'll slide out slowly if you haven't done it three times but if you don't need to hold on to it for very long um do you have ones you here try it put one in the wall don't nail it okay jump up grab it then jump again like higher you place them so low
[421:55.50]Before it falls out, you can get one jump, but you can do at least one piton.
[421:59.73]Oh, okay.
[422:00.51]So if I hit it once, you're saying that it'll... Yeah, then see how long you can hold it.
[422:07.00]Oh, that changes everything.
[422:11.13]Really?
[422:12.71]Yeah.
[422:13.39]What is that, 14 hours?
[422:16.03]Oh, that's so long.
[422:19.10]That's an eternity.
[422:21.68]Yeah.
[422:22.27]I was under the assumption that it's just like they would all just kind of fall out like that.
[422:27.75]Oh man, OK, cool.
[422:32.44]Alright, um.
[422:34.82]Cool, what else do I want to ask you?
[422:36.76]I mean, when Ster recommends the game, I don't know.
[422:38.48]We get two 7 hour streams.
[422:41.96]I love this game and it's great.
[422:44.53]It's too hard though.
[422:48.03]Well, you're still playing.
[422:49.59]Yeah, I know it's too hard.
[422:51.78]that doesn't mean it's not too hard did the score change was it was a 9.4 on a scale it started at 9.6 the decay got it to a 9.4 I had a little bit of a crash out like an hour or two ago I don't know if you saw before I beat it oh no I I was streaming yeah I had a little a little small crash out I took it down to a 9.1
[423:12.84]I'm gonna have to watch that, though.
[423:14.76]I was actually angry.
[423:17.07]I had a lot of complaints.
[423:19.49]And then I beat Act 2 with literally seconds to spare.
[423:23.44]The goo was touching my heels.
[423:26.88]That was actually the first time how I beat it.
[423:29.47]Oh man, oh man.
[423:30.65]I don't know if I'm cut out for this.
[423:35.01]okay you got it is climbing speed you cannot handle it no but do you see I I do I had 230 climbing speed and I I just if I were you I would not take either of these you cannot handle it little pup what do you mean why not your camera the way you're swinging around and you're it is
[423:58.72]it's a lot man you just need to you need to slow down no you can't dude you can every time I slow down I hear the here comes the goo it's 10 seconds behind me what use the way you swing back and forth six times before you jump is killing you so if you if you move slower you probably would have been fine on the last elevator
[424:24.63]I'm taking that stamina.
[424:27.07]Oh, God, don't.
[424:28.51]What?
[424:30.32]This is just a joke run.
[424:31.58]I told you, I'm fine with getting this over with.
[424:33.20]Are they all joke runs?
[424:34.33]I hear this every time I check in.
[424:35.95]Yeah, because this is just a joke run.
[424:42.52]Okay.
[424:42.70]Okay.
[424:44.79]You find a grub yet?
[424:47.80]I don't know what that means.
[424:50.12]You haven't found a grub yet?
[424:51.92]I don't know what that means.
[424:53.45]Should I take one more break and come back with Ster the Expert?
[424:59.74]Or is it time to go?
[425:01.42]Oh, it's like nine o'clock, dude.
[425:02.63]I got to go.
[425:03.73]Yeah, it's really late.
[425:04.67]It's late.
[425:05.31]Alright.
[425:06.70]How long have I been screaming for?
[425:08.80]Hey, just snooze the ad the last run.
[425:11.72]No saves.
[425:12.12]I will, I will.
[425:13.22]Okay, no saves.
[425:14.35]I don't even want to see you print out a floppy.
[425:16.45]Okay, fine.
[425:17.63]No, no... When they're doing the trapeze, no net.
[425:22.78]Okay, fine.
[425:23.92]You got it.
[425:25.50]And you're going to be here to watch me get this going.
[425:28.63]Alright, let's go.
[425:31.31]If at any point you're feeling scared, just, you know, pause the game.
[425:35.45]um consult the manual alright and that's you yeah also jump grab with left hand jump grab with right hand jump grab with left hand that's correct right that's a good way to do this right yep and sometimes grab with two hands if you have a freak out and you need to just grab anything around you um ideally you don't freak out but sure uh can we get a snooze on that ad
[426:08.88]Alright, I got five minutes to beat this.
[426:11.73]Easy.
[426:12.95]Actually, longer than that.
[426:18.14]What were those jumps?
[426:19.82]I don't know.
[426:20.60]I'm just making... Don't look.
[426:23.53]Don't look.
[426:25.77]A little embarrassed in front of your hero, right?
[426:28.86]Alright, but I want to look back.
[426:30.18]You gave me some criteria.
[426:31.58]You said that you didn't think I was going to get through Act 1.
[426:37.63]You said, hey, dude, there's no way you beat Act 1.
[426:40.03]I thought that you were not going to beat the elevator on Stream 1.
[426:44.55]Okay.
[426:45.88]I'm very surprised you're back with a Stream 2.
[426:49.08]Right, okay.
[426:50.16]Perseverance, you will thrive and survive if you keep at it.
[426:54.52]Do these matter, the notes?
[426:56.72]Uh, no.
[426:57.58]I mean, they matter because it's lore.
[426:58.76]Okay, so the answer is no.
[427:00.73]There's some secrets in here, man.
[427:02.13]I think I found a couple and... Okay, I gotta move.
[427:05.60]I can't just sit here.
[427:07.06]Yeah, that's... Yeah.
[427:12.03]You told me I haven't seen a shitload of stuff in the game.
[427:15.31]You haven't seen a grub.
[427:17.00]The little, like, rat thing.
[427:18.74]I don't think so.
[427:20.08]Have I seen a grub, guys?
[427:21.06]That's insane.
[427:22.11]I don't know what that is.
[427:23.41]Have we seen a grub?
[427:24.33]I heard one earlier.
[427:25.49]Like, in your last run we were playing, you haven't found one.
[427:28.20]It was crazy.
[427:31.43]So next time you're in the, you beat act one and you're before that room behind the giant thing that closes, you can climb up that wall and there's a little secret there.
[427:41.38]Sometimes there's a little grubby.
[427:43.79]Alright.
[427:47.17]Saw one once, but you skipped it.
[427:48.65]Unforgivable.
[427:49.57]You have to save the grubs.
[427:52.47]Does it do anything good for me?
[427:55.40]Yeah.
[427:58.00]No spoilers.
[428:00.58]Okay.
[428:03.17]But yeah, there's a whole huge area after the elevator that you got to in Act 2.
[428:09.35]The lights.
[428:12.05]It seems like there's a lot that... Okay, let me ask you this.
[428:15.29]It changes up a lot there.
[428:16.34]There's, like, there's that elevator, then there's, like, two to three other distinct zones in Act 3.
[428:21.16]Act 3 is pretty varied.
[428:23.42]Do you think that... This is not... Don't look at this part.
[428:33.21]Just don't look.
[428:33.79]Okay.
[428:34.27]Okay, I didn't look again.
[428:35.12]Okay.
[428:35.78]um okay so this room pause pause behind the squasher okay like the opposite wall okay the opposite side of the wall you you go up there there's usually really good items up there behind that behind pretty good change like behind the crusher after it crushes no no turn around from the crusher the back wall that you don't need to go to there's this one back here kind of yeah there could be a grub there it could be a grub he says
[429:02.84]Like back here?
[429:04.53]Yeah.
[429:04.67]Is this a grub?
[429:05.11]I think there's one of those little... Oh, shit.
[429:06.67]That's kind of a sick item.
[429:08.99]Okay, so that's it?
[429:10.60]Yeah.
[429:12.98]Oh, you're getting gooped.
[429:14.92]I can handle it.
[429:15.50]I'm sorry.
[429:16.38]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[429:21.31]You...
[429:27.03]I thought I could crouch underneath that.
[429:35.98]Like, ooh, it's coming.
[429:36.82]I had to go.
[429:39.42]Oh my god.
[429:40.20]Alright, I'll see you later.
[429:41.91]If you're in tomorrow, we're doing our Towerborn sponsored stream.
[429:48.72]And then afterwards, you're going to beat Act 3, right?
[429:54.11]I am happy that I concluded Act 2.
[429:56.31]Here, you like hand me the controller and I'll get you to Act 3.
[429:59.46]And then you can play.

[431:06.55]In two play sessions, beating Act 2 and shooting a flare gun at the monster and screaming and going, holy shit.

[431:16.96]You still get friend points.
[431:18.45]You beat Act 2.
[431:20.01]I said you're my hero if you beat Act 2.
