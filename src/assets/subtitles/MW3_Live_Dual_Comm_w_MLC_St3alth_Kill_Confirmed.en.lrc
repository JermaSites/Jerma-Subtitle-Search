[00:06.95]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.51]Jerma and MLC Stealth here.
[00:12.69]Go ahead and say hello.
[00:14.31]With a Team Force 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:16.95]That's not what this is.
[00:18.07]This is Modern Warfare 3.
[00:21.13]Oh, where is this guy?
[00:22.77]How did I not... What just happened?
[00:23.91]Oh, this is a live commentary, by the way.
[00:25.73]If you couldn't already tell...
[00:27.55]Playing with MLC Stealth.
[00:28.73]He is like the Call of Duty guru.
[00:32.09]So I'm trying to... This is on the PC where I don't know how to aim or shoot.
[00:37.46]You're ten times better than I am.
[00:39.08]So I'm just going to follow you.
[00:40.86]Or am I?
[00:42.90]Have fun getting free deaths.
[00:47.12]Because I'm going to lead you off a cliff.
[00:49.82]Oh, this guy's screwed.
[00:51.74]Oh, P90X, get jacked!
[00:53.90]What?
[00:55.08]Wait, why do I...
[00:57.99]Why am I running Specialist right now?
[01:00.29]I mean, not Specialist.
[01:01.11]So you can get the easy MOAB.
[01:02.35]No, but I'm Support right now.
[01:03.67]I don't want to be Support.
[01:05.49]Oh, well.
[01:06.55]I wanted to have, like, Predator drones drop on people's skulls.
[01:09.13]Oh, there you are.
[01:11.63]Predator drones.
[01:13.07]For those of you that care, I'm using... This is the P90 with... I believe it has range and suppressing on it.
[01:21.17]Suppressor.
[01:23.80]Where did you go?
[01:24.36]Uh, I... towards the enemies to kill them all.
[01:28.05]Watch out for that bogey up in that tower.
[01:30.65]There's nobody really up there.
[01:31.47]Tango 6.
[01:32.39]I made that up.
[01:33.47]Ugh, negative zero sniped me.
[01:35.59]Oh, God.
[01:36.53]Oh, come on.
[01:38.55]What?
[01:38.79]Oh, I got, like, a double kill with a javelin.
[01:41.11]What just even happened?
[01:41.91]How did I not kill him?
[01:42.69]He went... he didn't even hit me.
[01:45.65]He, like, went through me like a damn ghost.
[01:50.10]So, where are you?
[01:51.30]Oh, God, I'm...
[01:53.04]Everyone just saw how terrible I am.
[01:55.18]What do you think of Patrick Swayze?
[01:57.32]I can't believe I didn't kill this guy.
[01:59.54]I gotta see this again.
[02:01.44]I, like, unloaded on this guy, and he just owned me.
[02:06.14]So, wait, what do I think of who?
[02:08.00]Patrick Swayze?
[02:09.44]And Demi Moore.
[02:10.16]Do you think she was good in Ghost?
[02:11.82]I don't know.
[02:12.70]I didn't even see that movie.
[02:14.48]Did you see that movie?
[02:15.46]Oh, God, I have... This is not turning out well for Jerem.
[02:20.52]Oh, that guy just got, like, a triple kill with his akimbo FMGs.
[02:24.36]What a beast.
[02:24.62]He must be really good.
[02:25.38]Alright, that's not gonna happen again.
[02:26.30]He's really good.
[02:27.20]That's not gonna happen again.
[02:32.13]Tango on the roof.
[02:32.97]Come on, man.
[02:33.95]Hit more.
[02:34.35]How many times do I have to hit somebody before I kill him?
[02:36.71]Oh, I am using that same team.
[02:37.71]Never mind.
[02:38.05]Oh, it's double team.
[02:41.49]Up top.
[02:42.01]Up top.
[02:42.53]Negative zero down.
[02:44.07]Flashbang out.
[02:44.75]God, that took so long to kill that guy.
[02:48.22]Bogey's above us on the roof.
[02:49.40]Oh, God.
[02:49.88]Oh, God.
[02:50.40]Oh, God.
[02:50.68]I'm scared.
[02:52.05]No, no.
[02:55.54]Do I have ice?
[02:56.18]I don't know.
[02:58.40]Be careful.
[03:00.88]So for those of you wondering if you don't know who Stealth is, Stealth, go ahead and give a little brief synopsis of who you are.
[03:06.09]Oh, I don't know.
[03:08.57]I play Call of Duty.
[03:10.69]Oh, I'm just some guy.
[03:12.45]I'm five foot ten.
[03:13.79]My favorite color is a combination of blue and red, some call that purple.
[03:19.44]I really like Hot Pockets.
[03:20.70]I think that's a pretty tasty treat.
[03:22.75]And I sometimes upload Call of Duty because I like this game.
[03:25.79]A.K.A.
[03:26.25]you are like a beast at this game and you get like MOABs every 15 seconds.
[03:31.33]I don't know.
[03:33.15]Oh, nice switch right there.
[03:34.55]Yeah, you switched and let him shoot me instead of you.
[03:39.35]I'm up top.
[03:39.66]I don't know what you're talking about.
[03:42.32]Oh my god, how many times do you have to... Thank you for saving my life right there.
[03:47.69]You owe me so many things now.
[03:50.63]I got an advanced UAV.
[03:51.81]You want it?
[03:52.53]Should I do it right now?
[03:53.99]Oh, like now.
[03:54.75]Do it.
[03:55.30]Also, stealth bomber.
[03:56.64]Get inside the building!
[03:57.48]Get inside the building!
[03:59.28]Wait, what?
[04:00.52]I can't get in.
[04:01.12]Did you just lie to me?
[04:03.48]Did that really not just even happen?
[04:05.30]It absolutely just happened.
[04:08.14]I had some, like, Chips Ahoy cookies still in my mouth.
[04:09.92]So, Jerma, who are you?
[04:11.65]Tell, like, my people who you are.
[04:15.15]I'm a crazy dude that tries to shoot people from a thousand miles away with an SMG and doesn't get any luck.
[04:20.53]No, I'm a, uh... I don't know, I do Team Fortress 2 and all kinds of weird, dumb stuff.
[04:26.78]Pretty much, that's who I am.
[04:28.50]So what do you think about Scientology?
[04:31.15]Um, I think it's a religion that was created, and that's pretty much all I really know about it.
[04:38.77]I know Tom Cruise is one.
[04:39.99]I don't know if that's like, oh god.
[04:43.19]He was pretty good on that recent movie.
[04:45.01]Come on!
[04:47.55]Oh, don't worry, I'm only 9 and 11.
[04:49.68]That's a weird combo.
[04:53.48]Yeah, it's better than, uh, like, 1 and 11 on the other team.
[04:59.21]If my hand's red, that's slightly better.
[05:01.75]You know what's tricky, though?
[05:03.33]I have the game volume turned almost all the way down for recording purposes.
[05:07.41]So I'm just like, who's that right in front of me?
[05:11.84]So that is why you did not hear the demon stealth bomber coming to kill us all.
[05:16.06]I can't see anything!
[05:17.70]What just even happened to me?
[05:20.06]I'm lost and forgotten.
[05:22.49]You're lost in translation?
[05:25.01]But yeah, if you're watching this on my channel, his link will be in the description.
[05:28.82]He's a cool dude.
[05:30.04]If you're watching this on my channel, there's going to be a link in my, like, ten videos ago, and you're going to have to, like, search for it.
[05:38.28]I will not make his link easy to find.
[05:40.94]Yeah, make sure it's, like, incredibly difficult.
[05:43.26]Wait, wait, wait.
[05:43.84]Come back here.
[05:44.70]You.
[05:45.54]Turn around.
[05:46.56]I almost just killed myself.
[05:47.32]There's a guy in this room.
[05:48.30]Get him.
[05:49.48]Because I can't.
[05:50.06]I'm too stupid.
[05:51.08]Alright.
[05:52.38]Oh, behind you.
[05:52.88]Behind us too.
[05:53.72]No, I got him.
[05:54.20]Don't worry.
[05:56.60]This game scares the absolute crap out of me.
[05:59.93]It really does.
[06:00.57]Like, this... Did we win?
[06:03.15]Yeah, absolutely.
[06:04.15]Oh, we won.
[06:05.21]Oh, nice.
[06:06.67]Well, there we go.
[06:07.51]Oh, Nick, zero quit out.
[06:08.79]Hey, I went 12 and 12.
[06:10.79]Oh my god.
[06:12.17]Campers won again.
[06:12.97]That's what Phoenix said.
[06:15.43]Dude, look at that jumping shot to end it.
[06:17.19]That was pretty awesome.
