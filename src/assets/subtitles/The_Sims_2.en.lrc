[ve:61.1.100]

[00:55.29]Hello there.
[00:55.77]How are you?
[00:59.13]Sound a little different today.
[01:00.19]I found the music folder.
[01:06.93]The music folder I've had for about three or four years.
[01:10.19]We got BRB music back.
[01:15.27]As well as the BRB screen.
[01:20.68]So there we go.
[01:25.44]Today, I know I'm a little early.
[01:30.96]Yeah, and I know Infinity Nikki and I've got some explaining to do.
[01:36.48]Okay, so listen.
[01:38.38]When I said that I was going to do Nancy Drew seven days after that stream, what I meant was seven to ten business days and no holidays and no Tuesdays.
[01:51.55]So we're actually still pretty much right on track for that stream.
[01:56.86]at the end of this week.
[02:01.46]Also, I'm gonna go back to getting up and stretching every hour.
[02:08.65]And at the same time, that's a good place to run the ads.
[02:11.52]So as of right this stream, this very moment,
[02:15.72]There should never be a pre-roll on this channel ever again.
[02:20.38]Now, it might be fucking annoying.
[02:22.22]I actually might be annoyed by it.
[02:24.54]So, if it's too annoying, I'm just going to go back to doing it only on BRBs only.
[02:30.65]But, we'll see how it goes with this experiment.
[02:35.41]Yeah, as of this stream right now, well, as of the first ad break, I guess that that makes sense.
[02:42.41]Yeah, not right now.
[02:43.39]Not right now.
[02:44.05]I mean like three minutes from now.
[02:45.65]Because remember I told you I was going to extend the starting soon.
[02:48.65]So I got to get it right.
[02:53.26]Pre-roll suck.
[02:53.92]I'll take an... I'll take... Wait, what did you say?
[02:55.88]Hey, can you stream later?
[03:01.96]I'm watching.
[03:02.48]You're getting over it, VOD.
[03:05.78]What?
[03:07.74]I just got a pre-roll.
[03:09.25]When it ended, you said that there would be no more pre-rolls.
[03:14.51]Oops.
[03:14.71]Yeah, we're going to play Sims 2 today.
[03:17.27]I'm going to get my coffee.
[03:22.24]I actually am realizing I should have just had the ads play at the very beginning instead of five minutes of stalling into the ad break.
[03:30.60]So I fucked that up.
[03:32.76]But we're learning here.
[03:35.29]Sims 2 I got it to work finally and yes that title is accurate I I have flown an airplane before and I have gotten The Sims 2 to work on a windows 10 windows 11 pc uh it's harder to get The Sims 2 to work I've done both
[03:57.73]It's really not that hard.
[03:59.93]No.
[04:00.17]Okay.
[04:00.51]It's not hard.
[04:02.69]It's just irritating because anytime you open up a video game, it's like, okay, well you need a patch.
[04:08.19]Alright.
[04:08.51]Where do I get this patch?
[04:09.70]Well, you can't get it anymore.
[04:10.86]So you have to get a third party.
[04:11.98]Okay.
[04:13.02]Oh, also by the way, um, this game cannot utilize memory correctly.
[04:17.16]So you got to get this, like this other patch that lets you utilize memory correctly or your game's going to be fucked.
[04:24.52]Okay.
[04:26.08]Oh, also, you have to get this graphic overhaul mod that like cooks into the game system files or shadows look crazy and there's like a bunch of graphical errors.
[04:39.25]Why does he sound so mad?
[04:40.23]I'm not mad.
[04:43.36]It just is what it is when it comes to PC gaming from like Windows XP.
[04:50.27]I would love a world where we could play these Windows XP, Windows 95, Windows 98 games without a virtual machine, which I've done before and it sucks.
[05:00.87]It's a big pain in the ass.
[05:03.85]Alright, let me go grab my coffee.
[05:06.77]There's going to be ads are going to start here.
[05:09.63]So I'm going to put this on screen here too.
[05:11.55]Does this help?
[05:13.19]If you see that, does that help you?
[05:15.67]Because no content.
[05:16.65]I'm just going to make my coffee.
[05:17.86]I'll be right back.
[05:19.21]Alright, let's get started.
[05:20.84]Are you ready?
[05:21.46]Alright, I'll be right back.
[05:30.24]I definitely have to adjust this, though, because it happens way too late.
[05:36.78]I will adjust it for the next stream.
[05:38.48]Alright, here we go.
[05:39.46]Be right back.
[05:40.25]Coffee.
[08:25.76]Bye.
[09:21.97]Okay, I think this should be ending.
[09:23.85]That was very delayed.
[09:24.87]When I saw that it was happening, it happened at least a minute or two after I thought it was going to happen.
[09:33.12]We'll get it right.
[09:34.02]People are coming back here.
[09:34.88]This should be ending in about five seconds, which should now turn off pre-rolls.
[09:40.18]We back?
[09:42.49]Hey, welcome back.
[09:45.19]Okay, are you guys ready to start?
[09:50.19]So we'll see how this goes in an hour or so.
[09:53.27]I'm going to get up and stretch.
[09:54.91]If I don't fucking feel like doing it, we're just not going to do it.
[09:59.76]Alright, you guys ready for Sims 2?
[10:01.00]It took me ages to get this done.
[10:03.30]So let's just go ahead and do it.
[10:07.00]But yes, Infinity Nikki and Nancy Drew will make an appearance eventually.
[10:13.22]Don't worry.
[10:13.62]Alright, let's go.
[10:20.95]Wait, I need to turn this up.
[10:24.61]Anybody recognize this song?
[10:28.44]Yep.
[10:31.26]Time for time for a nostalgia stream.
[10:35.58]OK.
[10:36.72]Can you see it?
[10:39.96]Come on, please tell me you can see it.
[10:42.62]Yes, OK, thank God.
[10:45.46]Welcome to The Sims 2 Double Deluxe.
[10:51.08]Hopefully this doesn't run like shit.
[10:52.56]It shouldn't, but we'll see.
[10:56.49]Alright, now here's the question.
[10:57.69]Do I start in Pleasant View, Strange Town, or Verona-ville?
[11:04.49]I could just do default.
[11:06.22]Default.
[11:10.22]Strange Town.
[11:11.96]Seeing a lot of Strange Town.
[11:15.94]No, you have to do Strange Town.
[11:17.25]Okay.
[11:17.35]Okay.
[11:19.51]Okay, this is it.
[11:20.27]Truth seekers move to strange town hoping to discover the secrets of the town holds.
[11:24.68]Do aliens live among us?
[11:26.90]Do missing Sims mysteriously appear here?
[11:29.88]In this town, nothing is what it seems.
[11:31.54]Okay, this is if you want me to get abducted.
[11:33.34]Okay.
[11:39.98]Okay.
[11:44.22]Oh, it's just like Nevada.
[11:47.48]There are even aliens here!
[11:48.52]There are aliens in Nevada!
[11:49.74]The fuck was that?
[12:01.88]This feels like a Garry's Mod level.
[12:04.10]What's going on here?
[12:05.56]This doesn't feel right.
[12:07.02]This feels wrong.
[12:08.06]Is this the real game?
[12:12.64]okay looks like your some of your expansion packs have no associated neighborhood each pack needs at least one associated neighborhood okay I I only have one expansion is it should I not see this is this all these spoilers this town is weird just ignore all this ignore all this okay whatever
[12:40.37]Well, I have downtown.
[12:42.16]The only expansion I have is nightlife.
[12:43.80]I have to make a sim first.
[12:50.02]Hold on.
[12:52.00]Is this person's house a pool?
[12:53.76]Your whole house is a pool.
[12:59.18]This is this is a weird neighborhood.
[13:03.89]What house should I even move into?
[13:05.09]Should I build my own?
[13:07.87]I don't know if I want to build my own.
[13:09.07]It's been like 25 years since I played this one, I think.
[13:11.43]Alright, well, let's make a sim.
[13:33.33]Oh, everyone's getting so warm and fuzzy from this one.
[13:38.12]I don't know the name yet.
[13:38.96]I have Groot family.
[13:45.21]Okay.
[13:55.80]Oh, don't click a thousand times.
[13:57.28]That's how you... What am I, stupid?
[13:59.80]I just like... That's how you... This game is very finicky.
[14:04.98]It barely fucking runs.
[14:06.16]I'm not going to be an idiot and just start spamming.
[14:09.61]I'll break the computer.
[14:10.37]Okay.
[14:12.11]So, what do I want?
[14:22.35]Well, I'm going to make, I'm just going to make an adult.
[14:24.61]Should I make one person?
[14:25.91]Okay, every time I play The Sims, I always make like seven people in the house and like three people die.
[14:32.95]Like two people die every time because I just can't keep track of everybody.
[14:36.55]I'm saying one or two.
[14:37.75]I'm saying one.
[14:42.22]No, I'm not making five people.
[14:44.18]Okay, we'll do two.
[14:46.76]Start with one.
[14:47.44]I'll start with two.
[14:50.88]it's gonna be roomies roommates and this is roomie one groot okay okay you can't you can't there's not a whole lot of uh body options it seems but we'll do that one
[15:18.52]okay what do I want for a head I kind of like that one you need to make miku no we're doing original characters we're doing original no miku we're doing roomie one groot and roomie two groot okay two original characters
[15:58.62]This menu is so old, but I love it.
[16:13.36]No.
[16:15.64]Maybe a hat.
[16:22.03]This is important.
[16:22.63]We got to make the face.
[16:23.37]Can I move this out of the way?
[16:32.43]If I can't, it's fine.
[16:38.24]Oh wait, you can make people look kind of weird in this game, can't you?
[16:40.70]Okay, I'm liking it so far.
[17:00.27]You need to change the resolution.
[17:01.59]No, I am not doing shit with that.
[17:05.11]Do you understand how fucking horrible it was to get this to work?
[17:09.17]It is running at 1920 by 1080p.
[17:12.30]It looks good, feels good.
[17:13.94]I'm not pressing any more buttons.
[17:15.18]Alright, we're going to do kind of like a clean...
[17:28.89]put together guy and a sloppy, rude roommate.
[17:34.57]You know, like a not put together guy.
[17:36.17]We're gonna do like the odd couple.
[17:43.43]Looks good so far.
[17:44.17]I think you could guess which one this guy is, right?
[17:48.18]Now you're not supposed to be smiling.
[18:04.10]whoops uh oh uh what do I do about this how do I uh fix this don't tell me to open a menu
[18:41.23]Uh-oh.
[18:42.77]It looks like Agent 47.
[18:45.43]But it is retirement.
[18:49.33]And he plays golf.
[18:53.94]That does kind of look like 47.
[18:55.10]Oh, there we go.
[19:01.08]Okay, that's fine.
[19:24.10]Why can you... Okay, it can't be that ridiculous.
[19:29.03]Okay, that looks fine.
[19:41.11]Definitely the frown.
[19:42.41]Always.
[19:42.73]Like Mr. Magoo.
[19:53.00]Okay.
[20:02.77]What's that comedian that has the fucking puppets?
[20:06.69]And he's got an old guy, and he's like, yeah, all the people in the audience, you're all stupid.
[20:13.17]Who, what, what's his name?
[20:15.13]Jeff Dunham.
[20:15.91]Yeah, this is the Jeff Dunham puppet.
[20:18.27]The old guy.
[20:18.71]Looks like Nixon.
[20:28.39]It does kind of, okay, it's the nose that's doing that.
[20:30.69]Hold on.
[20:35.96]I don't think that really fixed it, but whatever.
[20:37.54]Okay.
[20:46.87]Alright.
[20:47.71]You know he's no nonsense when he's got glasses and a frown.
[20:51.05]I don't know which ones.
[21:01.26]Those first ones seem... Okay, these seem kind of good.
[21:11.61]Or these.
[21:16.01]I'll do those first ones.
[21:16.77]Those ones are fine.
[21:22.35]These are a little too artsy, I think.
[21:23.89]I'll stay with these.
[21:33.12]Am I filling in his eyebrows?
[21:38.84]Okay, perfect.
[21:59.99]Why is he bald?
[22:00.87]I haven't gotten that far yet.
[22:02.09]Give me a minute.
[22:08.05]Okay, the mustache just looks like chocolate milk all over his mouth.
[22:11.67]Because his face is too fucked up to paint it correctly.
[22:14.81]It looks like when a little kid gets a chocolate bar in a movie.
[22:20.63]Yeah, we're not doing Walter White.
[22:22.45]I'm not doing that.
[22:23.23]We're doing whatever this is.
[22:31.98]No, no, no, no, no.
[22:32.90]That's too interesting.
[22:34.83]No.
[22:37.59]That's fine.
[22:47.09]That's pretty close, I think.
[22:54.51]No, no, a little too modern.
[23:01.95]I think this is perfect.
[23:13.40]This person said, stop making my dad.
[23:15.70]Damn.
[23:18.62]Okay.
[23:18.86]Alright.
[23:22.46]The outfit is very important.
[23:26.60]No way.
[23:27.80]No way would this be, this guy would never be caught.
[23:31.84]It's only, like, gray t-shirts.
[23:35.18]Or, like, a suit jacket.
[23:36.76]It's the only thing that this guy wears.
[23:37.92]I could do, like, total full outfits though, right?
[23:49.26]Yeah.
[23:54.09]Okay, I like this.
[23:57.09]By the way, this music.
[23:59.43]I don't remember this being in The Sims 2.
[24:11.74]Oh, here we go.
[24:12.18]Here's an everyday outfit.
[24:15.63]No, no.
[24:16.25]He kind of looks like a sleazeball.
[24:17.63]No, no, no, no, no.
[24:26.35]Okay, I like this.
[24:27.09]I think this is good.
[24:34.48]Is it though?
[24:35.20]I can't.
[24:35.64]Wait, wait, wait.
[24:37.08]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[24:37.72]He's not going to.
[24:38.38]He's going to have to be.
[24:46.11]Alright, should we make him like a backstage stagehand?
[24:54.15]What do you think?
[24:54.59]Should we give the guy the puppeteer outfit?
[25:04.64]dressed like this and friends of mine would call me a fucking puppeteer that's why that's why I'm saying that okay I used to wear the black and black and it would be like dude what puppet show are you about to do and I'm like alright fucking whatever uh I'm gonna keep it because it's just it's just strange enough alright now we need formal outfit absolutely not no no
[25:35.05]Yes, exactly.
[25:38.15]Perfect.
[25:41.53]OK, is this like what you sleep in or will you go to the?
[25:44.95]OK.
[25:46.77]We should give the red speedo.
[25:57.74]I will give him the red speedo.
[26:01.82]He's a pajamas, OK?
[26:07.42]I think that's fine.
[26:09.56]Swimwear, that's fine.
[26:10.82]Maybe he's the red speedo guy, okay?
[26:17.81]He's also the red athletic outfit guy.
[26:25.09]Alright, aspirations.
[26:27.89]Turn-ons and offs.
[26:30.27]Please select your sim's turn-ons and turn-offs.
[26:33.23]Click on each of the boxes above to select a trait.
[26:36.85]Your sim will be more romantically attracted to other Sims who have the traits that you've selected as turn-ons.
[26:43.06]You can do tur- I forgot you could even do this shit.
[26:46.58]Okay, this is supposed to be the no-nonsense.
[26:50.69]Like, the stickler.
[26:54.43]Okay, so we're gonna just grouchy.
[26:56.37]Very serious.
[26:58.75]Um, very neat.
[27:00.37]Every point is neat.
[27:02.67]Uh, let's go there in the middle.
[27:05.13]We're not not lazy at all.
[27:07.51]But not active either.
[27:11.37]OK, what is it when you're not physically active, not lazy?
[27:17.65]Is there a mentally active?
[27:24.57]I think that's fine.
[27:25.39]That's good for this character.
[27:28.63]It's called being a square.
[27:31.59]Alright, turn-ons.
[27:32.33]It's gonna be... These are turn-ons, by the way.
[27:40.89]Alright.
[27:41.85]Vampires?
[27:45.60]Okay.
[27:46.50]Underwear is a turn-on.
[27:52.38]Oh my god.
[27:53.26]Okay.
[27:54.04]Custom hair?
[27:57.67]gray gray hair is a gray shirt is a gray hair glasses okay definitely formal wear and vampires is this this kind of guy that'd be into vampires I think or how about glasses I love what does turn off that's funny
[28:31.61]Oh, let's make custom hair.
[28:33.37]I think that's interesting.
[28:34.29]Okay, what about turn offs?
[28:36.47]If somebody stinks.
[28:42.92]Or they're, well, like...
[28:49.15]Yeah.
[28:50.29]That's a huge, because it's something I don't like.
[28:52.57]I don't like when somebody smells.
[28:55.03]He likes hair and formal wear.
[28:57.97]Okay, that sounds pretty good.
[28:59.72]This name is fucking dog shit and it needs to change immediately.
[29:03.56]I refuse to go any further until this is fixed.
[29:13.52]No.
[29:16.40]Family.
[29:17.91]Romance.
[29:19.57]Definitely knowledge.
[29:22.99]Knowledge or fortune?
[29:27.01]Oh, absolutely.
[29:27.87]Sims with a knowledge aspiration want to know everything there is to know about anything.
[29:31.17]Kind of like know-it-all.
[29:35.37]Okay.
[29:39.62]Alright, that needs to change.
[29:41.16]Oops.
[29:42.20]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[29:43.88]No, no, no.
[29:44.24]What do I do?
[29:49.45]guy sucks imagine wearing black okay the photographer needs to be fired for this by the way because any photographer that's going to take this photo needs to ask the question first dude do you have any other clothes because this is going to look weird a black backdrop with you I guess you want this uh I need to change this we need to edit okay I don't want their last name to be Groot
[30:22.83]I don't know.
[30:25.92]Robert Groot?
[30:30.62]Bob Groot.
[30:31.84]I can't change it.
[30:37.09]Oh, OK, I can.
[30:41.31]OK, now we need to create another sim.
[30:44.47]OK, also adult.
[30:46.51]OK.
[30:56.39]Alright, now we need somebody super outgoing, super funny, super interesting, complete opposite of like, because he's going to be like a bookworm.
[31:07.04]You know what I mean?
[31:09.01]Not this one.
[31:44.16]I like this guy way better already.
[32:09.70]So do you think smaller eyes or bigger eyes?
[32:12.62]Probably a little bit bigger.
[32:14.42]Just a little.
[32:14.86]Look at how happy he is already.
[32:33.29]No, we can't make... We can't make him look crazy.
[32:35.79]Okay, hold on.
[33:03.16]Okay, it's looking... You made him ugly?
[33:06.06]No I didn't!
[33:17.65]The big smile.
[33:47.52]Okay, alright.
[33:53.19]Wait, what about, uh, oh wait, eyebrows.
[33:54.57]Build them in?
[33:58.25]No, no stubble.
[34:01.07]Alright, now we need everyday outfit.
[34:13.62]I don't think anything needs to be changed from here.
[34:15.50]I think this is perfect.
[34:20.06]Okay, does this guy kill the other guy?
[34:24.71]Is that the big twist of this movie?
[34:27.61]Does this guy kill the other guy?
[34:30.05]We expect the other guy to be the mean kind of curmudgeon.
[34:32.61]No, it's going to be this guy kills him.
[34:37.03]Oh, wait a minute.
[34:41.30]I'm liking it.
[34:43.68]Hold on, the blue.
[34:44.50]We got to get different bottoms.
[34:51.24]Yeah, this looks super positive, doesn't it?
[34:55.78]This is the same outfit that the double dream hands guy was wearing, and that guy was fucking positive, okay?
[35:07.61]You just made John Arbuckle?
[35:13.43]I think it's perfect.
[35:15.17]I don't want to do anything else.
[35:16.07]No, I don't want to change anything else.
[35:17.11]We'll do formal.
[35:21.55]That definitely would be in a pinstripe suit and would pull it off.
[35:34.07]This is the type of outfit that... Yeah, it would be this.
[35:38.13]It'd be this.
[35:38.57]I like it.
[35:51.72]Should they both just be, should they both just have red Speedos?
[35:56.26]Yeah.
[36:01.92]Yep.
[36:04.08]Swimwear.
[36:04.62]Imagine being at the same pool party with a guy that was also wearing a red Speedo.
[36:14.09]Imagine wearing a Speedo at all under any circumstance.
[36:19.55]Is I guess another question that I would have.
[36:31.78]I'm not a speedo guy at the beach.
[36:34.22]To be the speedo guy at the beach is the guy that's confident enough to be in a speedo and do cartwheels in the speedo.
[36:40.74]To almost prove.
[36:52.26]prove that like nothing's gonna fall out that's my big concern with the speedo I did absolutely not like this is on this is outrageous to me is it's that simple alright alright well let's go let's go we gotta go personality uh we're gonna say that we want
[37:20.31]Popularity, absolutely.
[37:22.43]Outgoing.
[37:25.43]But really sloppy.
[37:27.40]Outgoing.
[37:29.18]Lazy.
[37:29.76]Playful.
[37:32.70]We don't have enough points.
[37:45.26]Okay, there we go.
[37:47.30]90% outgoing, 90% nice.
[37:49.64]Lazy and sloppy.
[37:50.96]The absolute antithesis to Robert Groot.
[37:59.07]Okay, so what's your name?
[38:08.11]Alright, what if he likes when people smell?
[38:12.37]Because his roommate hates when people smell.
[38:23.79]Something very outgoing.
[38:33.20]Cologne?
[38:33.72]I don't know.
[38:34.28]Fitness?
[38:34.68]Alright, fitness.
[38:35.60]It's so funny.
[38:37.00]He's turned on by fitness, but he's very lazy.
[38:40.10]Glasses?
[38:40.57]Okay.
[38:45.39]No!
[38:47.07]Okay, wait a second.
[38:48.61]Alright, wait a second.
[38:49.11]How about vampires?
[38:51.13]There's already vampires in the game.
[38:56.27]Turn off our glasses.
[38:58.21]Does that mean he's just going to hate his roommate?
[39:08.31]Okay, that's fine with me.
[39:17.98]I don't know.
[39:18.42]What's a good name?
[39:30.83]Andy?
[39:32.15]Don?
[39:38.44]Chaz?
[39:39.58]No.
[39:46.00]Jason?
[39:46.46]I like Jason.
[39:51.18]Jason.
[39:51.58]Okay.
[40:03.48]So, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[40:04.64]So now I have to do... Alright, family relationships.
[40:10.68]So this is the... Okay, roommate.
[40:16.14]They're roommates.
[40:19.20]Hold on, wait, cancel.
[40:21.70]This last name is awful.
[40:28.05]Chud and Chad.
[40:38.04]Um... You need to make them hug.
[40:44.47]I'm... Where... I don't like that guy.
[40:48.87]I'm rooting for the guy on the left now.
[40:50.57]The guy on the left is who I'm rooting for.
[40:51.73]There you go, Grootman.
[41:04.59]This is Bob...
[41:08.03]And I forgot his name already.
[41:09.95]Bob and Andy Grootman.
[41:19.31]I'm ready.
[41:21.67]I think I'm ready to go.
[41:26.32]Let's see how this plays out.
[41:27.98]Are they married?
[41:28.52]No, they have roommates.
[41:29.26]I think I'm ready to go, right?
[41:33.32]Except the family.
[41:35.18]It's a better picture than that.
[41:42.44]same name whatever Grootman is a it's like a okay Grootman is more like like a Discord server you know what I mean it's not necessarily like what your name is just like that's like a server you're in they're in like the Grootman household
[42:10.38]It's a Grootman household.
[42:11.66]It's a Grootman home server.
[42:15.55]Where am I even going to bring these two?
[42:21.17]How much money do I even have?
[42:23.79]All these houses are fucked up, by the way.
[42:25.89]I just want to... I can't afford this place.
[42:32.58]Wait, I can afford this one.
[42:41.54]Should I build my own house?
[42:42.54]Or should we start small?
[42:51.41]I'm seeing a lot of yes.
[42:52.51]Please build your own house.
[42:53.47]Okay.
[42:53.57]Alright.
[42:53.85]Alright.
[42:54.07]Alright.
[42:54.43]We'll get a lot.
[43:12.28]Grootman is the name of their VTuber agency.
[43:14.52]That's true.
[43:17.44]Oh no, they already hate each other.
[43:18.94]I can't believe you decided to move us over here with no house.
[43:22.93]How are we supposed to do anything?
[43:24.25]It's dry.
[43:25.31]It's...
[43:33.54]No, fucking don't give them a house.
[43:34.66]Let them fucking hate each other.
[43:36.20]All they have is their personalities.
[43:38.12]They don't have water.
[43:38.92]They don't have food.
[43:39.58]They don't have a home.
[43:40.13]All they have is their personalities.
[43:41.19]That's all they have right now.
[43:42.17]They're going to hate each other.
[43:43.21]Oh, okay.
[43:43.61]Alright, before the first punch is thrown.
[43:46.73]Let's build them a house.
[43:48.47]I have $15,000.
[43:49.21]Is that enough to build a house?
[44:05.11]This is going to be a very, very easy small house.
[44:08.89]We can expand upon it later.
[44:10.03]It's not about how big the house is.
[44:13.50]It's what you make it.
[44:15.14]Of it.
[44:15.98]It's not the size of the house.
[44:18.72]It's how you make it.
[44:19.78]It's what you make of it.
[44:20.82]I don't fucking know.
[44:21.84]Go read a Hallmark card.
[44:23.02]Okay.
[44:33.17]You can do half walls?
[44:40.48]uh doors and windows let's get probably hard for you to see this but that's okay multi no I need to just like a these icons are very small I give them a grocery store
[45:10.08]Are these automatic?
[45:10.86]That'd be funny if they were automatic.
[45:13.68]They need one twin size bed.
[45:15.26]Hey, let me deal with the comedy.
[45:18.44]Let me deal with the comedy furniture.
[45:19.82]Okay, not you.
[45:20.78]Alright, what if I gave them one window to climb through?
[45:30.85]Is it weird that I feel like I wouldn't even care if this was actually the front door?
[45:39.12]I feel like that's a very secure home.
[45:40.58]I mean, it's a pain in the ass for you to leave, but like... Oh, there we go.
[45:57.57]Solid walnut wood.
[45:58.93]Should we do Nickelodeon style?
[46:02.63]Alright, let's do the Nickelodeon door.
[46:06.24]Do it like right here.
[46:06.84]And then... This is going to be walk-in and this is going to be the kitchen.
[46:21.38]Open concept.
[46:22.14]Kitchen goes up here.
[46:23.66]Leads into the living room, which is right here.
[46:25.22]And then there's going to be a bedroom right there.
[46:26.60]Door to the bedroom right here.
[46:31.10]Open concept.
[46:38.79]Okay.
[46:39.63]I need floors.
[46:45.27]Tile?
[46:45.83]We'll do tile in the kitchen.
[46:46.95]I don't like tile.
[46:48.93]Oh, shut the fuck up.
[46:51.84]I want to hear it.
[47:04.46]Can you get a full refund for stuff?
[47:05.60]Because I think this is ugly.
[47:20.53]No, no, it's a natural stone material.
[47:25.89]I'll live with it for now.
[47:30.83]We'll do wood here.
[47:31.91]What's this one?
[47:37.02]No, I don't like that.
[47:42.26]I don't like that either.
[47:53.04]Where's carpet?
[47:53.60]There's carpet.
[47:54.12]Okay.
[47:59.38]Okay.
[48:02.45]Installing The Sims 2 is not harder than flying an aircraft.
[48:05.43]Have you done both?
[48:07.07]Because I've done both.
[48:10.17]And I'm assuring you that operating an aircraft is easier than installing The Sims 2 and getting it to work.
[48:26.64]It's so funny because I can actually say that.
[48:32.03]I have... Well, I've not flown a real plane.
[48:35.55]I've flown a fake real plane.
[48:38.97]And there were two or three people in that fake real plane that knew more than I did.
[48:43.75]But I still did it.
[48:45.21]And it was easier than installing The Sims 2.
[48:56.05]OK, that's good so far.
[48:58.07]We do need a bathroom.
[48:59.63]I'm going to wait.
[49:00.07]We'll do it a little.
[49:01.02]Hey.
[49:01.14]How about a little addition back here?
[49:05.06]How about a little addition?
[49:07.30]OK.
[49:09.66]Take a look at this.
[49:16.07]How's that?
[49:16.43]Take a look at that.
[49:17.03]Now the house is not just like a perfect square.
[49:20.95]Give ourselves a little addition.
[49:36.90]Go is the bathroom.
[49:40.52]Nice architect Andy.
[49:44.92]That's true.
[49:46.04]Alright, we need tile in the bathroom or yeah.
[49:54.17]Why is this like pre dirty tile?
[50:06.90]it's marble do checkered tile for the kitchen we'll fit we'll get that we'll get it figured out don't worry we're gonna take we'll we'll get it we'll get it situated okay I have nine thousand three hundred dollars I gotta make this last because neither one of them has a job and I don't know we're in this weird strange land oh and that's why it's called that
[50:42.49]Where's the bedroom?
[50:47.00]That's good right there.
[50:49.78]That was the worst noise 2025.
[50:52.98]But don't worry, they'll be finding more.
[51:00.09]Should we give them both tube sock beds?
[51:14.40]Alright, this is some Bert and Ernie shit right here, OK?
[51:16.56]Uh, that's good for now.
[51:30.22]Living room.
[51:32.26]You gotta have a sofa or couch of some kind, right?
[51:41.17]Bigger than that.
[51:42.73]A durable value sofa.
[51:47.88]I like it.
[51:54.44]TV.
[51:56.88]How expensive were TVs back in like 1998?
[51:58.70]Alright, so now this would be like 2006.
[52:03.67]When did The Sims 2 come out?
[52:04.55]Like 2005?
[52:04.69]2006?
[52:04.71]Alright, this is $8,000.
[52:05.11]This is the marquee item in The Sims 2.
[52:11.93]It's the TV.
[52:18.15]I forgot about that.
[52:19.31]That's right.
[52:20.17]This is the most expensive thing I think in the whole game.
[52:23.07]Besides like a hot tub.
[52:31.90]This one's $4,000.
[52:33.14]No.
[52:36.30]First of all, let's get a telephone in the kitchen.
[52:38.06]Right here.
[52:39.28]Right there.
[52:40.56]Because people call you and shit.
[52:43.54]People call you in The Sims 2.
[52:52.28]What?
[52:52.66]Really?
[52:52.97]You can do that?
[52:57.35]You can do every dentist office in America?
[53:03.31]Oh no, this is more like a hospital.
[53:10.12]All the doctor's offices, all the dentists, all the hospitals, they always did this really far away CRT TV.
[53:21.13]prison as well this is a prison TV I wonder if they're gonna like it I'm gonna keep it there for now because I only have seven thousand dollars left tonight I don't care that's so awful
[53:50.64]That's, oh, these walls need to go too.
[53:53.28]I need to get some wallpaper.
[53:54.56]These are, oh.
[53:55.56]It's like a Counter-Strike map.
[53:59.00]It's like a jump map from TF2.
[54:01.51]Like a surf map.
[54:02.99]This has got to change immediately.
[54:11.48]Was it under building?
[54:27.43]Masonry?
[54:35.30]Mm-mm.
[54:36.84]Something that's just kind of... I don't know.
[54:40.36]Like an olive?
[54:45.23]That's more of a... no.
[55:11.79]Can't you hold shift or something?
[55:13.17]There we go.
[55:16.29]Nice funeral home.
[55:18.31]It's a Sims 2, man.
[55:19.75]Like, it's not... This is not an interior design contest.
[55:35.60]Oh, that's so gaudy.
[55:37.66]Okay, good.
[55:57.37]put stucco on the inside of the bathroom yeah stucco goes on the outside how about um whatever blue it's too blue whatever
[56:16.70]What are you trying to make?
[56:17.78]Nothing.
[56:18.84]My design prowess is probably 0.1.
[56:22.48]Okay.
[56:26.11]So they have stuff.
[56:27.41]Guys, I'm going to change everything in like an hour.
[56:31.25]Okay.
[56:32.43]I need appliances.
[56:45.61]Why can I not select appliances?
[56:54.42]There we go.
[56:56.20]I need a fridge.
[56:57.02]I need a stove.
[56:58.10]We're just going to get the default fridge.
[56:59.68]It's fine.
[57:01.72]I'm just going to put the fridge in the bathroom.
[57:03.96]That actually would be pretty sick, but you know, we're going to have to do the normal shit for now.
[57:13.19]Just for now.
[57:16.21]Okay.
[57:22.39]Get some counter space too.
[57:29.17]I got everything.
[57:30.41]I just need to... I need a counter.
[57:32.61]I think that's kind of ugly.
[57:41.02]It does match the fridge, though.
[57:45.25]But I find it to be incredibly ugly.
[58:04.57]I don't care.
[58:06.91]Alright, here we go.
[58:12.27]Okay, we're on Bob Grootman and Jason Grootman.
[58:17.75]Remember, Grootman is the location where they're hanging out.
[58:20.88]Can you admire each other?
[58:36.34]You don't have a toilet?
[58:37.10]It's okay.
[58:39.48]We gotta get the reaction.
[58:45.17]Don't like it?
[58:48.33]Oh, he just wanted for a hug.
[58:51.55]Wait, you wanted for a hug before.
[58:52.63]Wait, uh-oh.
[58:59.13]Uh-oh.
[59:00.55]He just punched him in the face.
[59:02.57]He just assaulted him.
[59:03.65]He just assaulted him.
[59:05.34]Hold on a second.
[59:05.98]I gotta...
[59:19.35]Get out of the corner.
[59:20.21]This is weird.
[59:21.11]Alright, let's order a pizza.
[59:26.66]Hey, let's throw a party.
[59:27.60]No, no, no, no, no.
[59:28.36]Okay, slow down.
[59:30.56]Call.
[59:32.58]Wait, I can call delivery.
[59:36.18]Call a taxi?
[59:37.50]I can call a... Wait, my voice just went crazy.
[59:41.45]I'm not throwing a party yet.
[59:42.69]I have fucking $5,000.
[59:44.01]I'm not spending $1,000 on a party.
[59:49.66]They do need a toilet and a shower though.
[59:51.26]You're right.
[59:51.62]Let me get on that real quick.
[60:03.17]What is it classified as?
[60:10.99]Oh, here it is.
[60:19.07]Oh, there's not even a door to the bathroom.
[60:20.51]There's not a door to the bedroom either.
[60:21.91]Oops.
[60:33.72]I'm going to spend the money here because... Wait, what?
[60:50.42]Okay.
[60:53.44]I want to shower.
[61:03.26]I spend money in the bathroom.
[61:06.06]Okay.
[61:06.16]I need windows.
[61:07.62]This is just stupid.
[61:08.76]I didn't mean to do it, but I'm going to leave it for like a joke for an hour, I guess.
[61:21.34]Okay.
[61:26.57]That's fine.
[61:27.45]That's fine.
[61:27.89]It's fine.
[61:28.15]It's fine.
[61:28.39]They have a place to go to the bathroom.
[61:29.81]They now just need doors to get in.
[61:39.32]Same door for every room in the house.
[61:41.00]This kind of standard default one.
[61:45.86]That's fine.
[61:46.28]Okay.
[61:46.50]So we need... No, not black.
[61:47.46]Okay.
[61:51.54]Okay, that's fine.
[61:56.98]That's good.
[61:57.70]Alright, we are officially... I'm ready to see what happens here.
[62:03.46]And windows and lights.
[62:04.62]I'll do that after I get up and pee.
[62:07.95]And stretch my legs.
[62:09.39]In a few minutes.
[62:13.83]Alright, go to the bathroom.
[62:19.35]What's wrong?
[62:21.83]What's the matter?
[62:23.41]Does he not know how to use the door?
[62:28.50]Do you not know what a door is?
[62:29.74]Wait, what?
[62:31.28]Wait, what's going on?
[62:32.54]Why did that happen?
[62:33.44]Didn't I put a door here?
[62:45.29]What?
[62:51.08]So close the door.
[62:52.06]I don't understand what the problem is.
[62:59.70]Oh, he was admiring the door.
[63:01.29]Oh, I thought he was saying, I can't go in or something.
[63:03.03]I thought he was like, what's going on with the door?
[63:04.19]Minus $500.
[63:10.19]Why is it $500 to use the toilet?
[63:11.77]What was that?
[63:16.67]He had a job in the medicine career.
[63:19.48]Buy a telescope for at least 500 bucks.
[63:22.28]What the fuck just happened?
[63:24.24]Why is there... Why is this... Who put this in?
[63:26.32]Who put this in here?
[63:31.91]What is this?
[63:32.71]It's like burnt fucking food.
[63:34.75]That shit is steaming and burning up into his nostrils.
[63:47.19]You gonna offer any?
[63:47.97]I guess not.
[63:59.11]OK, at least he's eating.
[64:04.63]What are your goals?
[64:05.97]Meet someone new.
[64:07.83]Make a friend.
[64:08.61]Or be a politician, OK?
[64:20.83]Oh, they need a trash barrel.
[64:22.43]That's right.
[64:22.77]They need a trash barrel.
[64:23.45]Uh... I don't know.
[64:26.43]Do that.

[176:18.57]I do have nightlife.
[176:20.93]We just want to make sure they don't die in the first three days.
[176:25.43]I will take them out to the club.
[176:26.55]I promise you.
[176:27.23]Just want this to build up a little bit more.
[176:38.85]Okay, you just puked again.
[176:40.53]Alright, that's fine.
[176:45.71]Have a snack.
[176:46.51]Clean up a little.
[176:48.97]Clean up, clean up.
[176:52.19]Clean the toilet.
[176:55.59]Then take a shower.
[176:58.01]Then... I need something that's fun.
[176:59.87]What's cheap that I can get that's fun?
[177:01.85]Watching the TV, I guess?
[177:06.43]What else is technically fun?
[177:23.18]This one's fun.
[177:25.47]A wabbit head?
[177:29.19]Oh, you can only use that if you're a kid.
[177:36.49]Wait, I can play with a teddy bear?
[177:38.71]Talk through to Jason?
[177:46.97]What?
[177:56.02]Puked again.
[177:56.50]I know, I know, I know.
[178:01.24]We have to... You have to go relax.
[178:04.18]Just go sit on the couch.
[178:15.42]I might get a point for this.
[178:16.24]Good.
[178:28.96]Oh my god, it's gonna be that lady again.
[178:30.34]She won't leave me the fuck alone.
[178:31.36]Why am I... Okay, why am I doing this though?
[178:36.35]Okay, apparently that was really fun.
[178:53.78]I don't know if this is the time to do, uh, Mr. Mr. Cuddles.
[178:59.90]Or whatever this thing is.
[179:00.70]I mean, he apparently thinks it's fun.
[179:29.94]You gonna get that?
[179:31.26]If it's the lady again, I swear I'm calling her over.
[179:34.50]Dude.
[179:36.46]Why does this lady keep... I mean, just invite her over.
[179:39.74]Maybe we can hang out.
[179:40.74]I have work today, right?
[179:48.08]No, I don't.
[179:48.64]Okay, I'm calling her over.
[179:54.11]On a date maybe?
[179:54.83]I don't know.
[179:55.73]Maybe just come over as a friend?
[179:56.99]I should do a double date?
[180:21.35]Oh, yeah.
[180:22.41]Okay.
[180:22.95]I want to take them out.
[180:24.34]Let's go to another house.
[180:27.86]Oh, shit.
[180:28.68]Look, this person's got a whole pool for a house.
[180:30.40]Alright, let's go.
[180:31.16]Let's go hang out.
[180:33.66]We got an off day today.
[180:35.96]Okay, we'll go eat somebody else's food out of their fridge for once.
[180:40.41]Alright, let me save it.
[180:42.55]How do I pull to the neighborhood, right?
[180:46.71]Neighborhood.
[180:55.55]Is this a spa?
[181:13.84]I didn't tell them to go here.
[181:20.36]Oh shit.
[181:21.44]How do I get out of here?
[181:44.50]Oh that's not good.
[181:45.56]How does this work?
[182:32.57]I don't.
[182:34.51]How do I just delete what I just did?
[182:50.20]I don't care they have a roof.
[182:56.28]There she is.
[183:01.10]OK.
[183:06.10]I got the day off today.
[183:06.98]That's a hug.
[183:07.26]We're friends.
[183:07.58]We're good.
[183:07.86]Things... Okay.
[183:08.14]I'm telling a secret about something.
[183:11.70]Alright, come on in.
[183:43.33]Don't use that toilet.
[183:44.37]Oh no, it's clean.
[183:44.93]I cleaned it.
[183:45.53]We're good.
[183:52.19]Alright, no work today and I got all the points I need.
[184:03.70]The whole point is to be social here.
[184:05.06]Come on.
[184:07.97]What was that?
[184:10.42]Toilet broke again.
[184:11.08]Alright.
[184:11.32]No, no, no.
[184:11.58]Play chess, play chess, chess, chess.
[184:13.54]Perfect opportunity.
[184:21.76]Good.
[184:22.08]Okay.
[184:22.44]Good, good, good, good, good, good.
[184:25.20]What is my relationship with?
[184:28.44]That's actually pretty high.
[184:33.12]She clogged the toilet.
[184:47.97]Dude, come on.
[184:59.82]They're kind of hitting it off here, it seems like.
[185:02.94]Never mind.
[185:06.34]What about?
[185:06.88]OK.
[185:08.26]Just turn on the charm.
[185:12.86]Should we try to see maybe you're going to date or something?
[185:19.51]alright it's been one hour I'm gonna get up it's actually funny this actually is this is actually a great way to get my ass up off the seat
[185:45.34]I'm having a great time because these hours are flying by.
[185:56.31]He's lost it.
[185:57.27]Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
[186:01.67]Okay, yeah, it looks like it's... I can... Okay.
[186:05.75]Same here.
[186:06.05]Yeah, Sims is just one of those games that...
[186:09.54]It just doesn't even matter what's happening.
[186:10.86]I thought about this that I'm curious of how people feel about this too.
[186:15.14]Cause like The Sims five and The Sims six.
[186:20.28]The fun part about The Sims is the weird AI that's programmed to do certain things in a ton of a ton of different scenarios.
[186:28.09]I don't know.
[186:28.53]Like, are we going to get like a weird, like new kind of AI Sims?
[186:33.53]I feel like that would be creepy.
[186:42.08]Like, that would be weird.
[186:46.31]I like the fact that they're, like, programmed to puke into the toilet.
[186:50.03]If an AI Sim puked into the toilet, I'd be concerned.
[186:53.15]I'd be like, hey, what's going on?
[186:54.55]Why are you sick?
[186:58.93]Sims 5 is canceled.
[187:03.28]Is it?
[187:08.87]There is no five.
[187:09.87]Well, I'm just saying, like, in the future.
[187:10.99]You know, five, ten years from now.
[187:13.21]I have no idea where they're going to take this franchise, but... It could get really fucking weird, is all I'm saying.
[187:23.59]This poor guy.
[187:24.53]Okay.
[187:24.97]How do we... Can I buy medicine?
[187:43.83]What is he... Alright, it's time to spend some money on a better toilet because this thing is just green.
[187:52.75]Green fumes are going up into his ass.
[187:55.71]That's disgusting.
[187:56.85]That is absolutely revolting.
[188:08.50]I don't think the toilet even flushes.
[188:11.92]It's clogged.
[188:14.74]What are we doing?
[188:17.70]How can three people clog a toilet this badly?
[188:22.00]Alright, you go back to bed.
[188:26.42]Okay, just go to bed.
[188:43.69]Both of you go to sleep right now.
[188:49.42]What is the relationship like?
[188:51.28]It's pretty high.
[188:55.72]Let's share some interests.
[188:57.82]Then let's, I don't know, say like... No, no, it's too early.
[189:09.50]We don't even know.
[189:10.38]We don't even know how the vibe is.
[189:18.73]Somebody said, where's the ads?
[189:20.23]Oh, I forgot to go on a break.
[189:24.59]That's on me.
[189:46.83]You're addicted.
[189:50.21]Alright.
[189:51.11]I think I... Let me see.
[189:52.05]I'll go on break.
[189:52.79]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[189:54.43]Let's keep it to an hour.
[189:55.41]Let's do it.
[189:55.79]Let's actually do it.
[189:56.59]You're right.
[189:57.65]Because I feel like I've done it before.
[190:00.27]I'm like, oh, I'm going to get up and stretch and we'll just maybe put ads where there's no content.
[190:03.35]And then I just don't get up for four hours.
[190:04.77]No, you're right.
[190:05.15]That's true.
[190:05.41]I do that a lot.
[190:11.60]I'll be right back.
[190:13.78]Two or three minutes.
[190:16.04]Ads might play.
[190:17.78]I think they might, maybe.
[190:19.02]If not, then I'll see you in two or three minutes.
[190:20.35]And if the ads are there, then we'll see you in a little bit.
[192:54.08]Thank you.
[193:31.23]you
[194:29.71]Hello.
[194:34.24]It's funny, it seems to be exactly three to four minutes for me to get up, move around a little, and then get a drink or whatever.
[194:43.20]It's like exactly three minutes.
[194:49.05]Welcome back.
[194:49.85]How are you?
[194:59.10]Okay, let's keep going.
[195:01.64]If you're just joining us, the two roommates, both are about to die.
[195:07.57]And I have to do whatever I can to keep them alive.
[195:13.29]Let's see if I can do that.
[195:21.90]Alright, let's do it.
[195:27.91]Did it crash?
[195:28.53]Don't tell me it crashed.
[195:31.59]Nope, we're good.
[195:36.81]Yeah, let's go to the club.
[195:41.57]We're going to go to the club tomorrow.
[195:43.46]No, I have to work.
[195:48.76]I can't go to the club.
[195:49.84]I need to go to work.
[195:50.80]8 p.m.
[196:02.47]I've had this game crash on me after about four hours.
[196:04.89]I'm saving it pretty frequently, so hopefully don't run into any major issues like that.
[196:16.77]Buy a bar.
[196:17.79]I don't need more money than that.
[196:26.28]When's the next day off?
[196:34.44]Alright, we're going to work and make a ton of money.
[196:37.42]And then on Wednesday, we're going to the club.
[196:43.20]Does that sound like a plan to everybody here?
[196:46.82]Just don't go to work?
[196:48.93]Okay, yeah, that's true.
[196:50.43]Yeah, I just want to go.
[196:52.25]Ow.
[196:52.93]You alright?
[196:56.97]Okay, yeah, let's just not go.
[197:00.85]But you need to be healthy.
[197:06.01]So let's... It's 5 a.m.
[197:09.83]Okay, let's have some breakfast.
[197:13.71]I need a food processor.
[197:14.89]They gotta be cheap, right? $2.20?
[197:34.81]Now they can probably make at least some food.
[197:36.33]I want more than toaster pastries.
[197:52.02]The toilet's flooded.
[197:52.80]Get a new one.
[197:54.28]True.
[198:16.52]Watch the cooking channel on TV.
[198:20.80]Yeah.
[198:26.76]All we eat are pop tarts.
[198:38.69]We're going to learn some recipes or something.
[198:53.71]Alright, now let's watch the cooking channel.
[199:04.70]Check the strudel in the toilet.
[199:07.96]Dude.
[199:09.46]Alright, ban that person for real for like a minute.
[199:20.10]I think you actually have to go to the grocery store.
[199:22.18]What?
[199:22.28]Alright, it's time to go somewhere.
[199:27.44]We're taking Jason somewhere.
[199:29.10]You have your day off.
[199:29.88]We're taking Jason to get some food or anything.
[199:33.03]Something.
[199:36.23]You're good.
[199:36.65]Alright, get dressed.
[199:43.56]How do I take him somewhere?
[199:44.62]Call a taxi?
[199:56.83]Uh, multiple Sims.
[199:57.91]We need a big taxi.
[200:04.27]We're gonna go to... What is this?
[200:08.37]Local shopping center.
[200:09.75]Okay, let's go to the shopping center.
[200:14.99]Clothes, food, and entertainment.
[200:17.77]Alright, let's go.
[200:24.40]You should probably put on new clothes.
[200:26.62]I guess you're just not.
[200:27.22]You're going to go in your pajamas.
[200:28.16]Okay, fine.
[200:29.04]He hasn't even fucking gone to the bathroom.
[200:40.57]Your mouse cursor is so big.
[200:41.97]It is huge.
[200:42.41]Alright, we've arrived.
[200:57.52]We look like a weird group of villains from a kid's TV show or something.
[201:02.06]Like, oh no, there goes Mr. Red and Mr. Black!
[201:12.46]What's his problem?
[201:22.11]Oh my goodness, this place is massive!
[201:26.59]Where's he going?
[201:34.91]Get this fresh produce.
[201:36.07]We need to get, okay, we're gonna get bananas.
[201:37.97]We're gonna get meat.
[201:41.11]We're gonna get onions.
[201:42.21]Buy all this shit.
[201:43.33]We have $59 is all we have.
[201:45.35]How do we have, I thought we had 500.
[201:46.31]I just had 500 bucks.
[201:47.65]Was a taxi $500?
[201:49.46]Why are you walking the perimeter like a dog?
[202:15.67]Where is he?
[202:20.87]Where is this?
[202:22.09]Where is Jason?
[202:22.90]Okay, I'm going to buy $16 worth of food.
[202:27.90]Okay, cool.
[202:32.62]Am I going to get some bread?
[202:58.00]Why are you walking this way?
[203:03.57]Dude!
[203:07.47]What is that?
[203:09.07]He's serving old hot dogs that somebody made?
[203:19.21]That's a ton of food!
[203:22.49]Why am I placing it?
[203:25.55]Okay, cool, good job.
[203:40.77]What's the end game on this?
[203:50.98]Why is he being a waiter?
[203:53.88]He doesn't have to do this.
[203:59.34]Why does he work here now?
[204:00.56]So he did?
[204:17.97]Am I putting down like poisonous traps for these idiot Sims to get food poisoning and die?
[204:23.68]That's what it feels like.
[204:24.40]Because this lady's eating it too.
[204:26.40]They're all eating it.
[204:30.92]It must be fine.
[204:43.24]He's been in the bathroom the whole time in his pajamas.
[204:58.60]What a weird guy.
[205:28.56]I didn't have to pay for this.
[205:38.65]What was that all about?
[205:50.88]Oh, he's going to clean up.
[205:52.20]Look at this.
[205:52.84]Hey, that was my weird bot dog burrito.
[206:02.80]And that is nasty.
[206:03.86]I guess I'm cleaning it up.
[206:13.00]I'm throwing it away.
[206:13.74]What am I doing?
[206:27.55]I'm doing the dishes.
[206:42.11]I just turned all the lights on.
[206:43.15]I've already just pissed off somebody on management.
[206:46.81]That just made my computer run really badly.
[207:01.94]Alright, try these clothes on.
[207:05.70]We should chat.
[207:35.02]Hmm.
[207:39.78]Where is he?
[207:48.29]Oh damn.
[207:49.71]Wow.
[208:06.57]Hello?
[208:08.29]No, put it on.
[208:09.49]Why did you take it off?
[208:18.32]Dude had a cape for 5 seconds.
[208:19.82]Alright, where?
[208:29.54]What is going on in here?
[208:30.46]Another bathroom argument, OK.
[208:43.51]Oh, relax.
[208:44.27]That was a quick pee.
[208:56.43]Stop getting into fights.
[208:57.93]Only two people can fit in this bathroom.
[208:59.92]Stop.
[209:02.56]Alright, we got him out.
[209:16.38]What happened to the stores?
[209:19.79]What is going on?
[209:25.17]Is he banned from these stores or something?
[209:26.81]What is his problem?
[209:31.38]Oh, wrong floor, right?
[209:35.98]Okay, so I got some food.
[209:37.06]I can't afford these clothes.
[209:38.72]I have $40.
[209:38.90]Probably can make some friends in here.
[209:51.15]100 bucks?
[209:51.45]I would call a taxi that's gonna spend all of our-
[210:11.25]See a ghost be saved from death.
[210:14.75]The game really wants me to die.
[210:43.29]Alright, I think we got our social charge back up.
[210:47.31]That's good.
[210:48.80]Is there anything fun to do here?
[210:55.14]What is in here?
[210:59.32]What is this?
[210:59.76]Go to the club?
[211:10.84]Yeah, it is club time.
[211:13.96]Alright, how do I leave?
[211:14.78]Is there the go home button?
[211:20.79]Or do you actually have to get into a taxi?
[211:24.99]Alright, let's go.
[211:46.99]Time is it 5 o'clock?
[211:48.95]There's still time.
[211:52.53]Let's go to another lot.
[211:57.69]Go visit that place over here.
[212:00.69]Do I have to do that by taxi?
[212:02.24]I guess so.
[212:14.18]Are we actually about to get a taxi that's going to turn around, just drive 15 feet?
[212:27.09]It's right there.
[212:27.77]I could have just walked.
[212:46.55]Maybe we needed a loading screen.
[212:52.15]Okay.
[212:54.74]This place is a spa?
[212:55.66]This is a gigantic pool.
[212:59.84]This is the biggest pool I think I've ever seen.
[213:01.18]Everybody in, right?
[213:03.96]Get in.
[213:04.24]Limbo!
[213:20.67]No, you don't want to get in?
[213:22.99]Are you sure you don't want to have matching speedos with your roommate?
[213:31.50]There we go.
[213:32.34]Nice.
[213:32.56]Oh my god, my computer.
[213:41.02]This is getting the fun, the social.
[213:45.42]I won't have to worry about these bars for at least two or three days.
[213:49.25]That's good.
[214:01.79]He's going to go grill hot dogs.
[214:03.63]Oh, hell yeah.
[214:04.27]Let's go.
[214:22.22]This didn't cost any money.
[214:24.69]I think I have a cheat code here.
[214:26.25]Hmm.
[214:29.97]It's called get in a taxi when you're hungry.
[214:34.53]Go to the public barbecue and make hot dogs.
[214:36.69]Alright, that's good.
[214:52.93]Look at these two.
[214:53.39]They're perfect.
[215:05.39]Why don't you go and sit in and talk to your friend?
[215:06.83]These people are talking, why are you not talking?
[215:28.93]Dude ate one hot dog and he's not even- he didn't even do anything.
[215:31.86]A Pop-Tart is better than that apparently.
[215:33.88]Okay, they're having fun.
[215:35.76]No, I'm not throwing a drink.
[216:01.33]uh rank The Sims games uh Sims 1 Sims 2 s tier uh Sims 3 a tier Sims 4 b plus
[216:30.09]They're all fun for their own reasons.
[216:33.23]In fact, I think The Sims 4 only goes into like that B plus tier.
[216:37.13]Because these old ones are so, just so weird and goofy and just so much stupid shit can happen in the first game, especially.
[216:51.83]Is there a shower here?
[216:52.61]Can I take a shower?
[216:56.25]Does this count?
[217:02.67]Sims 4 is a little too sandboxy.
[217:11.56]The thing I liked about Sims 4 is I liked when you're sick in The Sims 4 or you have any of those other kind of buffs or debuffs, the game kind of changes a lot around you.
[217:21.53]You get like a different bar.
[217:23.19]Interesting.
[217:24.67]Like when something was awkward, you're awkward for a little bit and you have an awkward meter.
[217:28.29]Interesting.
[217:29.88]Interesting.
[217:31.81]It's a little too easy, man.
[217:39.00]I don't think that you're allowed back here.
[217:52.88]Well, you know I'm really into bugs.
[217:57.38]Bugs I like bug spray.
[218:00.61]No shit, you like bugs too.
[218:03.61]Bugs wearing makeup?
[218:06.27]I've never heard of that.
[218:07.03]That sounds ridiculous, actually.
[218:09.53]That sounds stupid.
[218:11.03]No, I like bugs just the way they are.
[218:12.77]Ridiculous.
[218:16.11]I don't even know if this is his food.
[218:33.48]It's such a cheat code.
[218:34.40]You just get food forever.
[218:35.94]Just keep making hot dogs.
[218:37.00]They're free.
[218:52.43]Are they actually free?
[219:04.82]So I just said, dude, just live here, yeah.
[219:09.56]We go!
[219:10.08]Oh, look at the crab.
[219:40.87]Oh, that's so funny.
[219:54.86]That's so funny that it's free.
[219:58.71]Okay, if I pick up the plate and walk home, does that work?
[220:16.27]How many hot dogs does it take to get full stomach?
[220:27.48]Where are you going?
[220:28.18]What actually are you doing?
[220:37.33]Is he faking eating it?
[221:00.64]Hehehehehehehehe
[221:24.68]These guys just keep sitting down and eating.
[221:28.52]He's going to get sick.
[221:36.68]Oh no, he got minus 500 points because he had to go to the bathroom.
[221:45.98]Oh, he doesn't like using the public restroom.
[221:47.80]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, out, out, out, out, out.
[221:50.36]He hates public restrooms.
[221:51.56]I should have looked.

[222:31.20]I got to settle down.
[222:32.48]I'm going to try to live here.
[222:40.06]There are benches, right?
[222:41.21]Just leave here.
[222:49.25]That's so dumb.
[222:53.36]Just being on permanent vacation.
[222:59.57]I feel like that would, I don't know, I feel like that would kind of suck.
[223:04.39]Sleeping in a lounge chair and eating hot dogs?
[223:07.83]Every day?
[223:09.93]All day?
[223:10.61]Every day?
[223:10.97]I just, I walk around the Speedo and I eat hot dogs and sleep in the lounge chair.
[223:22.94]Like, would we be employees?
[223:29.37]Are we the designated speedo weirdo?
[223:31.41]I mean, he is cleaning.
[223:35.64]He's cleaning up.
[223:55.74]No, no, I can't.
[223:56.92]The party never ends.
[223:59.28]No.
[224:01.44]Hey, Jason.
[224:03.14]Why don't you whip us up a couple of dogs on that grill?
[224:06.61]The party never fucking ends.
[224:08.95]Hey, you guys want drugs?
[224:12.85]You guys want to smoke some weed or something?
[224:19.26]Okay, cool.
[224:20.06]It's all good.
[224:20.61]It's cool, man.
[224:21.15]Do you care if I sit in here?
[224:23.39]Do you care if me and my alien buddy sit in here with you guys?
[224:27.15]It's a little too hot.
[224:29.27]Can you turn the bubbles down?
[224:35.90]I don't like the bubbles.
[224:51.97]Why do you keep getting out?
[224:52.89]There we go.
[224:54.21]Alright, fine, go take a shower.
[225:22.20]Let him sleep, you monster.
[225:26.86]Where's... Where's Robert?
[225:32.25]He's still washing the dishes.
[225:38.39]Alright, we had our party.
[225:41.21]We had our party.
[225:41.91]It's time to go home.
[225:45.56]Sleep, sleep, sleep.
[225:46.48]Wait, is there a bench?
[225:47.20]There might be benches I can sleep in.
[225:59.42]I gotta go to work.
[226:03.72]He's cleaning the public toilets.
[226:06.18]What?
[226:08.88]Was he actually... Was he actually cleaning the toilets?
[226:31.28]Alright, go home.
[226:45.29]Be admired?
[226:54.19]Don't leave him behind!
[227:19.46]Alright, let's go.
[227:20.38]We're good.
[227:33.71]That was the end of an era.
[227:35.09]That's just the beginning of an era.
[227:45.52]Alright, take a shower.
[227:56.14]I'll take care of that in a minute.
[228:04.63]He's going to get run over by a car.
[228:11.94]Alright.
[228:13.78]Wake up and get into bed.
[228:14.58]I can't.
[228:32.07]Wait for the shower.
[228:45.26]This shower sucks.
[228:47.70]I think, has it ever been not water on the ground?
[228:52.41]Every time I take a shower, this thing breaks.
[228:54.89]Every single time.
[228:55.63]Hmm.
[229:02.15]Okay, I got work at 8 p.m.
[229:06.43]Go to bed, get a promotion, come back with some more money.
[229:14.00]Nice and comfortable.
[229:14.80]We're good.
[229:15.18]No, no, no, no, not this, not this, not this.
[229:21.12]No, no, no, no, no.
[229:21.60]It's okay.
[229:22.42]Oh, shit.
[229:31.59]shit this guy's been here three times what is he doing?
[229:40.57]I don't know yeah why does it want me over here?
[229:57.16]Why is it just a camera pointed at this guy's bed?
[230:00.70]I don't understand why he's doing this.
[230:04.12]Ultimate crash out.
[230:06.57]It's because he smells?
[230:12.15]Yeah, so what?
[230:13.77]Everybody smells in this game.
[230:28.60]Why is this video here?
[230:31.18]I'm just being like a giggly Gary today, honestly.
[230:47.09]No, let them.
[230:47.87]They need to sleep.
[230:50.99]No longer a friend.
[230:52.01]That guy.
[230:55.25]That guy sucked anyways.
[230:59.26]Alright, he's got a carpool in an hour.
[231:08.05]Alright, that's enough time for you to take a shower and go to the bathroom.
[231:12.61]Quick, do them both.
[231:13.53]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[231:14.16]Come on, come on, come on.
[231:16.10]Hurry up, please.
[231:18.32]Do not get in that carpool until you take a shower.
[231:21.50]Come on.
[231:33.10]Come on, hurry up.
[231:34.54]It's one hour, right?
[231:35.36]Or two hours?
[231:44.05]Just one?
[231:44.53]Oh, shit.
[231:53.21]That's not bad.
[231:55.91]Okay.
[231:56.31]Actually, I might get promoted.
[231:58.23]Good.
[232:01.81]Now you clean the house and we're going to get some more stuff.
[232:07.43]I mean, this is ridiculous, dude.
[232:08.44]You got to clean this up.
[232:14.88]He's actually using the food processor for the first time ever.
[232:27.75]Why did you do that?
[232:31.98]I made a bowl of marinara sauce?
[232:55.34]This is what I look like when I do this.
[233:12.48]And nobody knows the amount of the amount of us that actually like make food like this.
[233:17.34]Do you have a beer gut?
[233:18.30]Yeah, of course I do.
[233:19.24]Probably.
[233:19.98]Yeah.
[233:22.18]Just make spaghetti and meatballs.
[233:23.69]You were eating toaster pastries.
[233:27.09]Just made a five star meal.
[233:28.39]Why did he make too many hot dogs?
[233:30.45]That's why he learned how to cook.
[233:40.58]It's apparently pretty good.
[233:44.41]It's apparently really good.
[233:54.33]Spaghetti and meatballs, and then they put in quotes, five star meals.
[233:59.70]I've had some pretty damn good spaghetti and meatballs in my life that I would put up there.
[234:06.50]I'm still so hungry.
[234:22.25]Enjoy eating actual trash?
[234:27.35]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[234:28.63]Are some of you saying that spaghetti in meatballs is a trash dinner?
[234:32.49]No.
[234:32.85]What?
[234:33.33]It's like a staple.
[234:38.54]That is a staple.
[234:56.75]Yes, spaghetti is great.
[235:04.95]With any meat sauce is better than meatballs.
[235:07.85]Have like a bolognese.
[235:14.56]I actually like pasta a lot of the times with just olive oil.
[235:18.84]Little bit of Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper.
[235:25.36]I like it like that.
[235:33.83]Garlic, yep, with garlic too.
[235:38.41]Man, just drizzle in a good olive oil, like an EVOO onto a pasta.
[235:43.42]Salt, pepper, you're good.
[235:50.19]What about Alfredo?
[235:52.39]I have to be in the mood for Alfredo.
[235:53.94]I do like it a lot.
[235:55.68]But if you're not ready for it, it's kind of heavy.
[236:05.68]Garlic and onion powder.
[236:06.84]Those are the two most used seasonings in the pantry right now.
[236:13.01]I would say so.
[236:18.41]Oops.
[236:21.12]What the hell did I just do?
[236:23.04]Dropped the mouse.
[236:28.01]My mom makes the best fettuccine alfredo in the world.
[236:32.15]I am going to tell you something that you should do.
[236:35.57]I want you to make sure the next time you eat that, you know, don't make it, don't be so obvious about it.
[236:45.22]But bring up how you had fettuccine alfredo somewhere else.
[236:52.86]And it just doesn't taste like this, you know?
[236:54.48]It just doesn't taste like this.
[236:55.73]It doesn't taste right.
[236:57.41]Like this, this tastes, you know, this just doesn't taste right.
[237:03.03]You're going to make your mother so happy.
[237:05.15]Like, yeah, it's just like this one's like so much smoother and creamier.
[237:08.17]Alright, clean up.
[237:25.52]Then I need something fun.
[237:32.23]Sorry, I don't- I'm not gonna lie to my parents.
[237:34.93]Yeah, okay, you're- you're- Are you lying, or are you creating a scenario?
[237:48.54]It's not a lie, it's creating a scenario.
[238:02.65]My mother's awful at cooking.
[238:03.81]I'm not going to enable that.
[238:07.60]Well, I- okay, this is- the pretext of this is my mother makes the best fettuccine alfredo in the world.
[238:13.74]If you told me my mother's fettuccine alfredo sucks, I wouldn't tell you to- I wouldn't tell you to do that.
[238:25.95]Alright, put it on like cartoons or something, right?
[238:32.61]So put on kids tube is that like more fun and like goofy, right?
[238:46.02]That's way more fun than the other channel We said you're such a horrible dude and they just I don't know there's like three or four sentences I don't know what it said
[239:09.68]Sitting on his ass watching Cartoon Network.
[239:12.00]How typical.
[239:17.48]Nah, I don't do that.
[239:18.94]Cartoon Network used to be 24-7 on the TV.
[239:22.80]This is like 10, 15, 20 years ago, but you would have had to have pride that... Okay, so here's the thing.
[239:30.89]How many of you guys lost your remotes and just didn't give a shit?
[239:34.24]I'll tell you a quick little story.
[239:36.02]Lost the remote and the TV that I was in when I was in college, the TV, it could not be turned off.
[239:41.74]The power button was broken.
[239:43.73]So the power button, this is back in the day when TVs, you actually had to go press the button.
[239:47.81]I know, fucking crazy, right?
[239:49.25]Weird.
[239:50.29]So this television had a button on it that was just depressed in.
[239:55.45]And the only way you could turn this TV on or off was with the remote or by plugging, unplugging and plugging it back in.
[240:01.60]So we, the solution was instead of figuring this out and making this, uh, you know, getting a solution to why we can't turn the TV on and off.
[240:09.52]We decided it was just going to be on Cartoon Network 24-7 until somebody unplugged it from the wall.
[240:15.49]So that's a real story.
[240:17.15]And that's how strong of a network Cartoon Network used to be.
[240:21.89]Cartoon Network went all day with the banger cartoons back like 15-20 years ago.
[240:27.70]And then you got the Adult Swim.
[240:30.72]And that was original Adult Swim.
[240:31.96]That's Aqua Teen Adult Swim.
[240:36.56]Do you hear me here?
[240:45.79]I just forgot he came back from work and I was like, there's a man in my house now reading a paper.
[240:52.68]He didn't get promoted.
[240:53.72]Yeah, that's back when Courage the Cowardly Dog was a base show.
[241:03.90]That's when it was a baseline show.
[241:07.10]Dexter's Lab, baseline show.
[241:18.34]Johnny Bravo, baseline show.
[241:20.76]Cow and Chicken, baseline show.
[241:22.75]Somebody please talk.
[241:24.69]I don't like the tension here.
[241:26.81]This is not good.
[241:40.01]Hold on, I gotta get the machinima angles.
[241:45.59]Hold on.
[242:04.60]I'm trying to get a good shot.
[242:06.92]Alright, I got some money.
[242:08.55]We need something that's fun.
[242:18.91]Because then we're going out to the club.
[242:43.48]How much is a car?
[242:47.10]$950.
[242:47.14]That's it?
[242:49.63]That's nothing.
[242:52.43]I almost can get a car.
[242:53.43]I thought it was going to be like 10 grand.
[242:54.73]I guess some of them are.
[243:17.64]I need to put this on something.
[243:31.04]Table and what do I how do I?
[243:42.24]Well, it's just going to be on the floor or whatever.
[243:54.86]Oh, I need more... Okay.
[244:01.74]So I... No, I actually don't need it yet.
[244:03.25]Thought I needed more friends.
[244:10.57]I'm doing fine on skills.
[244:19.91]You either need to get a job or need to be the social butterfly of all the people that are coming over the house.
[244:31.60]I think that's the game plan.
[244:37.66]Stretch time?
[244:38.86]Not quite yet.
[244:42.20]God damn it.
[244:49.44]logic three max a skill out gain a skill point oh let me do logic then I'm in good shape after work they need a dining table so badly yeah they do they really do these are coffee tables but
[245:18.53]Dining tables are too expensive.
[245:22.29]And these are, these are, these are coffee tables.
[245:23.93]I mean, this technically is a dining table.
[245:27.92]I need chairs.
[245:40.34]Whatever.
[245:44.55]The only sink you have is the bathroom sink.
[245:46.31]Alright, next payday I will put a sink right here.
[245:55.78]They're gonna make Squid Game America?
[246:01.22]Nice.
[246:08.35]Okay, but is Squid Game America just gonna be Squid Game Season 1?
[246:13.75]But the characters are just going to be Americans.
[246:19.65]Right, it's just going to be Squid Game season one, but we're in America this time.
[246:28.87]Yes.
[246:32.23]Doing a Squid Game America is weird because Netflix came out in America, like it came out in America on Netflix.
[246:39.82]It's not like the American version of the hit show from overseas.
[246:44.86]It was on Netflix.
[246:46.04]It was promoted on Netflix.
[246:48.44]It released on Netflix and all the Americans could watch it.
[246:54.64]But it used to be if a show was coming from overseas, it'd be like, oh, and just wait till you see what we do as Americans with The Office.
[247:05.62]You couldn't watch The Office in America unless you had like BBC fucking 3.
[247:10.22]Whatever the network was.
[247:13.83]Eventually you could watch it pretty much anywhere.
[247:15.31]Dude, you're not tapped in right now?
[247:27.08]That's true.
[247:28.16]Good call.
[247:34.51]Get that one point.
[247:36.59]One more point.
[247:40.07]Ignore annoying roommate.
[247:41.63]One more point.
[247:42.31]Ignore.
[247:43.07]Ignore.
[247:43.25]Okay, now we can talk.
[248:15.23]need somebody new the time is work tomorrow okay uh it's time I got 250 bucks we're skipping work and we're going to the club but I have to make this neighborhood a club that's right right
[248:46.99]So, click to add a downtown.
[248:48.91]This dude's gonna no-show a paramedic shift.
[249:00.90]That is pretty, that's pretty bad.
[249:02.98]That's pretty fucked up, but you know.
[249:05.97]We got to go to the club.
[249:07.85]Okay, it's time to make a nightlife destination of strange towns like downtown above.
[249:12.17]Press the play button if you'd like to use the default neighborhood.
[249:16.59]Create custom destination if you'd like to create your own hotspot.
[249:23.23]Build lots.
[249:24.09]No, no.
[249:26.97]We're just going to do downtown.
[249:28.51]Let's do the regular one, right?
[249:34.08]Okay.
[249:35.30]Play?
[249:38.48]Creating downtown.

[249:52.39]Who you got?
[249:54.92]Buffalo Bills, right?
[249:58.74]It's the closest related to Buffalo Chicken Subs, so that's the one I picked.
[250:14.39]Okay, there's all new kinds of Sims to me and even a few spooky surprises.
[250:19.09]Buy your Sims a car and get them cruising on to downtown.
[250:24.40]Okay.
[250:26.60]We need a car.
[250:35.03]This house is bad.
[250:35.65]This is like somebody got halfway into making a monopoly house and they just didn't care anymore.
[250:42.28]how do you not care making a monopoly house it's literally four squares and a roof you can use a taxi well we got downtown available I need to make sure everyone's happy
[251:07.52]They're not happy yet.
[251:08.52]Alright, let's cue this up.
[251:10.34]I got plenty of logic.
[251:11.27]We're fine.

[253:56.23]Do you want to meet me there?
[253:57.09]This food down there, right?
[254:07.84]This is kind of a date.
[254:10.38]I'm really surprised that Bob's the one that got a date first, if that's what's going on here.
[254:19.55]Okay, I'm going to say yes, but I am going to take a break.
[254:25.09]Get up and move around.
[254:28.01]Uh, this time I... Whoa, no, no, no, no.
[254:29.77]Did I hang up on her?
[254:31.35]No, I took too long.
[254:32.85]Shit.
[254:36.23]Uh, we'll... It's okay.
[254:40.33]You fumbled that so bad.
[254:41.45]No, no, we'll see her out.
[254:45.81]We'll see her out.
[254:47.21]You missed that opportunity?
[254:48.13]No, no, no, we'll be fine.
[254:51.07]Please don't burn anything, please.
[255:02.45]Well, why are you not eating the spaghetti?
[255:05.70]Make the spaghetti for both of you.
[255:09.48]You can't just make a bowl of gruel and expect it.
[255:12.48]Oh my god.
[255:12.78]Alright.
[255:13.72]Alright, I'll be back.
[255:16.50]Be back in like three or four minutes.
[255:19.22]Ads are going to play.
[255:20.02]See you guys in a few.
[255:29.46]Ow, fuck my hand.
[256:00.36]I'm not even fucking muted.
[256:02.31]Stop swearing.
[256:03.21]I'm done swearing for the rest of the day.
[259:32.66]Hello.
[259:37.10]So, yeah, back before I would get up.
[259:42.52]I actually feel, like, good.
[259:48.29]The handful of times that I actually do this, I actually force myself to get up.
[259:52.29]Now, obviously, there's the... You know, it's like you're moving your legs around.
[259:57.49]But, dude, I would get up sometimes after, like, not getting up for three or four straight hours.
[260:00.95]And I'd be like...
[260:03.99]So my body was made out of quicksand.
[260:07.43]So.
[260:16.49]What's the stretch routine?
[260:17.37]I get up, I kind of just squat down to the ground and I push my leg.
[260:22.09]I do like leg squats.
[260:24.23]I do like five to 10 of them.
[260:26.71]I just walk around, grab a cup of water, take a sip of something.
[260:37.12]Is that how you stay so goddamn thick?
[260:43.83]We all have our routines.
[260:50.87]Alright, let's go downtown.
[261:01.74]It's good for circulation.
[261:02.70]It is.
[261:06.51]Did you wash your hands?
[261:07.25]Of course I did.
[261:08.59]Alright, let's go.
[261:19.08]Take a taxi to downtown.
[261:22.12]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[261:23.18]We're not doing this today.
[261:24.02]Tell him to leave.
[261:31.71]They're all shit.
[261:32.49]They saw you, dude.
[261:33.91]They saw you in your uniform.
[261:36.89]You might actually have to go.
[261:49.83]Go to work.
[261:52.16]We're going to the club, but it's I can miss work one day.
[261:56.26]I got 250 bucks that's worth at least.
[262:00.32]Two drinks.
[262:03.23]And an appetizer.
[262:14.20]Not going.
[262:22.88]Time stops when you leave your house.
[262:32.08]Oh, wait, make a bowl of soup.
[262:35.24]That's the easiest aspiration you could ever have.
[262:44.72]Aspirations is eating a bowl of cereal.
[262:47.36]It kind of feels like that sometimes.
[262:48.50]Sometimes I'll just wake up and be like, man, the goal today is to get like five grams of fiber in the next hour.
[262:56.35]I get it.
[262:56.63]I feel it.
[263:12.85]Alright, here's the question I have.
[263:15.88]Can he eat this and then stop and then the other guy sits down and eats it?
[263:23.20]Before we go to the club.
[263:28.98]Well, I guess he's just going to make food.
[263:33.21]They both need a full bar anyways.
[263:34.59]It's fine.
[263:42.97]That's fine.
[263:43.35]Is this pre-recorded?
[264:01.97]Uh, it's how, it's whatever you believe.
[264:03.37]Alright, you're good.
[264:24.91]I'm working on it.
[264:31.58]alright eat that food let's go get bladder done and then we're good maybe take a shower alright get out so then we're going we're getting out here it's time to have some fun let's go get a taxi
[264:59.97]This is a pre-recorded stream from 2006.
[265:01.25]The game's been actually running really well.
[265:15.29]There is... It's called the Graphics Rule Maker.
[265:18.78]I think is the actual name of the program.
[265:22.62]The only reason this looks like this is because I have that mod.
[265:31.75]There's like two or three community patches on this and that's the only reason why it looks like this.
[265:43.02]I have this game from EA launcher and it looks like dog shit and not full screen.
[265:47.72]I need that.
[265:50.07]Yeah, there's actually a couple of guides that give all the different resources for it.
[265:54.97]I probably could compile it and just at least like where I was, where I went.
[266:00.88]But definitely the graphics rulemaker is the most important thing if you wanted the game to look and kind of play better.
[266:06.20]Alright, downtown.
[266:14.67]Why didn't you get all the expansions?
[266:16.11]I've actually had this, and this is on the disk.
[266:18.99]I've had the double deluxe disk for years.
[266:22.45]I just never installed it because I got, well, no, I installed it, but then it got to the point where I couldn't play it.
[266:28.27]And you know, when you hit that point where you install something and you realize there's probably like an hour or two of troubleshooting to get something to work and you kind of just go, nah, I just don't, I actually don't care.
[266:39.78]Yeah, it's playing off a disk right now.
[266:42.50]Bro has a disk drive.
[266:44.94]I have an external USB disk drive that I only use once every year or two.
[266:52.14]Yeah, they gave it away for free.
[266:53.69]They would give this game away for free years ago.
[266:56.21]Alright, we're definitely going to go to the club, right?
[267:06.01]Yeah, let's do it.
[267:09.55]Because nobody could get it to run.
[267:21.63]Alright, let's go.
[267:22.11]Come on.
[267:22.45]We're going downtown.
[267:23.35]Get in the car.
[267:26.80]And why are you not dressed for the occasion?
[267:33.68]Somebody said, how do you still have no money?
[267:35.80]Your house looks the same.
[267:37.01]They were just saying, like... They were just calling me all kinds of names, I think.
[267:40.27]They were just saying I'm terrible.
[267:42.07]I don't know, because I'm at a net zero.
[267:45.69]I am spending the exact amount of money for me to keep these two guys alive.
[267:52.76]Alright, let's do it.
[268:06.27]Whoa.
[268:10.05]What, there's like slot machines?
[268:11.37]Oh my god, there's pinball machines.

[268:26.93]Are we going to get a drink?
[268:33.05]What's the problem?
[268:33.67]They're saying the counter is not green enough?
[268:38.48]Why are they behind the bar?
[268:42.44]They're talking shit about the decor.
[268:46.72]Oh, awful.
[268:47.64]Oh, these counters are ugly.
[268:49.52]They need to be green.

[270:27.01]Okay, there's nothing... I don't think anything's going to happen there for you.

[291:37.21]This was a terrible evening.
[291:40.53]This was an awful time.
[291:53.25]Get a telescope?
[291:54.13]I need to make money.
[291:55.11]Alright, we gotta go.
[292:22.88]Come on, Cab's out there.
[292:24.10]Look at him.
[292:26.50]Leaning again.
[292:32.98]That's... You have two days worth of shit?
[292:36.53]What, in his pants?
[292:38.61]No, wait.
[292:39.43]It has been like a full day, hasn't it?
[292:55.25]These people are crazy.
[292:58.99]He's just sitting down.
[293:01.60]What do you want?
[293:02.18]Are you looking for something?
[293:03.22]You want a drink?
[293:11.93]Why am I acting so strange?
[293:13.31]He's gonna get sick again.
[293:53.63]okay get out of here he doesn't want to leave I'm telling you
[294:11.34]Are you taking this to go?
[294:23.50]That was eventful.
[294:38.76]I love old game tech and old game AI technology because the game Sims 2 and Sims 1
[294:49.65]all The Sims have bars and because we're not controlling those Sims they're not being told to go to the bathroom so the longer that I stay somewhere the more the other characters are suffering because they can't reload into a different instance where they get their bars fixed and I cannot change their bars so the longer you stay out somewhere
[295:13.88]It's just total, complete mayhem because everybody else is having the same amount of problems that you are.
[295:21.18]Oh, whoops.
[295:26.18]Okay, okay, don't miss work tomorrow.
[295:29.95]Limitation breeds creativity, yeah.
[295:33.83]It's just so funny to see all the people have to go to the bathroom and the AI has not made them go to the bathroom because I'm not controlling those characters.
[295:44.80]So they just get up and just shit and piss their pants out at like a restaurant.
[295:54.62]Okay, uh, let's hope that you don't die.
[295:56.26]After licking, uh, was it 25 plates clean?
[296:05.43]And they're already fighting?
[296:06.41]Okay.
[296:06.71]Get to bed.
[296:12.81]Take a quick shower.
[296:14.89]Quick shower.
[296:15.69]Let's serve.
[296:18.27]Why can they only still make this bullshit?
[296:21.11]I've seen them make other stuff.
[296:31.82]They make spaghetti on their own, but I can only tell them to make a toaster strudel.
[296:38.92]You need to get food from the grocery store.
[296:41.91]Shit.
[296:44.62]Don't forget that that's in there.
[296:52.42]This is such a shit dinner.
[296:53.66]This is not dinner.
[296:55.42]I need groceries.
[297:04.56]I don't know how many days you could live off of a toaster pastry before you start getting boils on your skin.
[297:10.38]Hmm.
[297:12.98]I don't know.
[297:13.54]How long does that take before you start getting boils?
[297:31.37]That's a post club dinner.
[297:36.73]no no that's no no no no post club dinner is like just to buy as many mcchickens as you possibly can like as many mcchickens that like fit in the bag that's your post club dinner nuggets oh yeah or like oh like 200 nuggets
[298:18.08]Hey, you need to eat.
[298:21.90]Does anybody else think it's funny that I can't lick the plate in my own home?
[298:25.32]I can only do it as a weirdo in public.
[298:28.96]That seems kind of bizarre.
[298:30.75]Alright.
[298:37.33]You don't have to work.
[298:37.97]So just order some things.
[298:40.94]Let's get a grocery delivery.
[298:51.35]It's only dinner plates that he can do that to?
[298:59.24]That was a wild evening.
[299:07.28]You need to cook on the stove.
[299:11.88]50 bucks for groceries?
[299:14.43]It's a $50 delivery cost?
[299:16.35]Hang up.
[299:18.27]Fuck, I need it though.
[299:24.98]We can't just eat toasters, Pop-Tarts, things.
[299:28.94]Whatever.
[299:29.28]They're going to die if I don't.
[299:32.00]I know, I know.
[299:32.60]Alright, I get the delivery.
[299:39.63]I'm going to spend $75 to get 25 bucks worth of groceries.
[299:43.73]Are you kidding me?
[299:49.38]Click on the fridge and say serve meal.
[299:56.02]Do I have to accept the delivery?
[300:01.85]Do not put that down.
[300:08.53]Because they're delivering at 6 a.m.
[300:10.39]Oh, shit.
[300:12.47]Do not walk off this lot.
[300:15.03]We need that.
[300:19.07]Oh, thank goodness.
[300:21.04]Here, tip him.
[300:22.88]Here, tip him.
[300:40.64]Go throw that rotten newspaper in the trash.
[300:49.35]Okay, I know it looks like I'm... Look, I'm going to tip him.
[300:53.25]Oh, I'm going to tip him.
[300:55.49]Oh, he just left.
[300:58.27]That's happened three or four times in a row.
[300:59.67]I'm not doing that on purpose.
[301:06.93]Oh, shit.
[301:07.26]He wants to leave.
[301:10.13]I don't think you can find your own place for $100.
[301:11.77]Do crossword instead.
[301:17.30]Okay, now we have groceries.
[301:20.76]Who has the most cooking?

[301:48.48]Why can't I make anything?

[302:00.98]It's too low level.
[302:02.08]Okay, 8pm is when the carpool is here.

[316:05.79]This is The Sims 2.
[316:07.91]I didn't think that smash meant it's gone forever.
[316:12.07]I thought smash meant he was going to kick it and grab his foot and say like, yo!
[316:17.37]I didn't think he was going to destroy it.
[316:29.86]Smash the bunny.

[327:38.13]Okay, so I can be promoted.
[327:52.56]I just need good bars.
[327:56.75]Sleep for a little longer.
[327:57.51]Let's just speed it up.
[328:04.30]He's going to do whatever he's going to do.
[328:05.28]Okay.
[328:10.73]So his energy is high now.
[328:23.03]Okay.
[328:24.21]How do I remove this?
[328:26.04]Like, how do I just delete this?
[328:27.00]I guess, can I sell it?
[328:37.36]Why?
[328:37.58]Okay, what does that do for me?
[328:38.95]I have 10 of them.
[328:44.25]You don't have a pool yet?
[328:45.49]Because I have $165 and that's $20,000.
[328:54.78]He's almost... He can get up now.
[328:57.86]The goal is to, by the time the carpool shows up at 8pm... Okay, eat a toaster pastry.
[329:05.59]He can do that.
[329:08.03]I remade.
[329:11.61]Let's make a pastry.
[329:12.37]Fulfill those needs.
[329:16.32]I can buy stuff.
[329:19.90]I get 5,900 points.
[329:25.02]The noodle soother.
[329:28.58]It's a mood elevator.
[329:30.01]Okay, is this currency hard to get?
[329:37.62]The money tree.
[329:46.43]As long as one keeps them watered, money does... Wait, I can make money with this one?
[330:00.90]That was expensive.
[330:01.60]Hopefully it was worth it.
[330:09.69]Stomach growling?
[330:10.27]Restock the fridge by ordering groceries.
[330:12.03]Oh shit, hold on.
[330:14.31]Harvest the money?
[330:14.93]That's 40 bucks!
[330:28.68]Alright, have a toaster pastry.
[330:38.94]Get to cooking level two.
[330:41.53]Fuck, we don't have any food.
[330:42.63]Oh my god.
[330:45.41]It's called food.
[330:48.23]Yes, I'll pay the delivery fee.
[330:49.53]Whatever.
[330:53.48]You can sleep.
[331:00.13]That's fine.
[331:08.36]How many times you water it?
[331:09.18]Can I overwater it?
[331:13.06]Is that bad?
[331:13.78]Thank you, I'll take that delivery.
[331:45.55]Don't.
[331:46.51]What are you doing?
[331:47.33]OK, thank you.
[331:52.91]Appreciate it.
[331:56.99]Hey, you want to come in and have some three day old toaster fucking pastries?
[332:02.58]Nah, I wouldn't either.
[332:04.36]How are you doing?
[332:27.41]Get it out of the oven.
[332:31.83]Is there a problem?
[332:37.67]Oh shit, I haven't paid my bill in like three months.
[332:39.23]Okay.
[332:44.33]What happened here?
[332:47.35]Sell a masterpiece.
[333:12.84]Cooking level two.
[333:13.80]Alright.
[333:14.44]Read, study cooking level.
[333:15.62]Get the cooking.
[333:16.12]Come on.
[333:18.02]This is getting ludicrous.
[333:24.27]I'm not in the mood to do that right now.
[333:25.59]Well, we need something fun to do.
[333:37.95]Clean up the trash and then go relax in bed.
[333:46.29]This is how I actually go to the bathroom.
[333:53.74]To me, honestly, to me, the neuter that I am, the better.
[334:16.96]Primal, primal shitting.
[334:20.26]You're too predictable?
[334:25.24]I mean what, because I like to be as close to nature as possible when I'm using the bathroom?
[334:35.84]Now I'm talking about in the privacy of my own home.
[334:46.75]He needs fun.
[334:49.17]Oh, wasn't it fun to play with this thing?
[334:57.47]What's wrong with it?
[335:04.78]Yeah, I put on a puppet show and he loves it.
[335:14.10]And he has fun doing it too.
[335:27.65]Well, you had fun holding it, but... Well, you're the one that put it down there.
[335:39.19]What the hell are you doing?
[335:46.91]It's in use.
[335:47.79]Oh, shit.
[335:48.49]Oh, come on.
[336:10.46]air I don't even care if he's not doing it I just want him to get the fun points oh my stop putting it down in weird places then man
[336:28.77]Oh, because he's... Alright, that is a little weird.
[336:32.07]Okay, yeah, that is very odd.
[336:33.91]That is a very weird thing to do.
[336:36.75]Especially the fact that he doesn't have any clothes on.
[336:39.19]That's right.
[336:39.90]Yeah, this is a little weird.
[336:41.10]Okay, to me, for some reason, he had clothing on.
[336:49.12]I was painting clothes on his body in my brain.
[336:52.12]Like, he wasn't naked in my mind.
[336:53.74]It was like he was just in there.
[337:04.58]Wait a minute, I know you.
[337:05.42]No, I don't.
[337:07.69]Nice to meet you.
[337:08.17]Well, I hate you, apparently.
[337:10.71]I don't like you.
[337:34.12]I remember there was a... This is 10 years ago.
[337:37.66]Sorry if my memory's not going to be perfect.
[337:40.19]Wasn't there a video or a game where like a naked guy's just walking around and I'm like, why is there a naked guy walking around?
[337:47.15]It was like an old... What the hell?
[337:48.33]What game was that?
[337:48.95]He's like walking around.
[337:53.54]It's an open world.
[337:54.00]Is it... It was Lucius.
[338:04.06]I think somebody got it.
[338:04.78]I think it was that.
[338:05.46]Yeah.
[338:09.58]And I think, like... I think, like, Ster... I, like, told Ster, please put clothes on this guy, and he... He, like, put a bunch of fucking fake clothes on him, superimposed on the video.
[338:21.21]I might be misremembering this.
[338:22.29]Okay.
[338:34.30]No, that is correct.
[338:35.04]Okay.
[338:35.84]It's hard.
[338:41.45]I'm telling you, it's hard to remember.
[338:42.55]I've said every word in the English dictionary.
[338:47.43]I've probably... How many words are in the dictionary?
[338:49.37]I've probably said every word 20,000 times over.
[338:52.79]I forget everything.
[338:57.80]Are you waiting for the phone to go to bed?
[338:59.94]There's not a phone booth.
[339:02.88]Get out of here.
[339:10.74]okay this guy's still here oh it's I'm talking to her I need fun I need to get it however I can get it I have to do it like this I have no money to buy anything fun I can just like pretend to I don't even know what I'm doing
[339:34.61]I don't know what the purpose of this is.
[339:36.01]What am I doing this for?
[339:38.79]Am I being funny or am I being helpful?
[339:43.04]What am I supposed to be doing here?
[339:44.58]Oh.
[340:04.04]That guy just stole my money?
[340:05.46]What do you mean he stole my money?
[340:09.78]He took it off the tree?
[340:12.36]You piece of shit.
[340:13.74]Did you really?
[340:34.65]Alright, stop talking with the bear to him while he's in the shower.
[340:44.58]He still wants to do it.
[340:45.62]Okay, the fun's doing fine.
[340:48.96]Get your social up by maybe just asking this guy to leave.
[340:55.02]And then I need to take a shower and then I need to eat something and go to work.
[340:58.00]Alright, that's not going to work.
[341:04.02]Uh...
[341:07.94]He's almost out.
[341:08.46]I only have one hour, two hours.
[341:10.11]Alright, get out of the shower.
[341:20.41]Come on, come on, come on.
[341:22.47]Stop fighting people and take a shower.
[341:24.67]That's a lot of negative bubbles of my character.
[341:42.32]I got work in one hour.
[341:43.70]Get out of my house.
[341:44.38]Whoa, we're going to have to have a... Hey, keep that ambulance running.
[341:54.50]Keep that ambulance running.
[341:55.50]Take him to work.
[341:58.89]Yeah, take him
[342:15.78]He just won?
[342:20.08]No, pick the toilet up and hit him in the head with it.
[342:25.66]Rip that toilet out and just have... And just fucking throw it at him.
[342:34.25]Damn.
[342:37.11]He just beats the shit out of me.
[342:39.23]Sends me to the hospital.
[342:40.91]And then takes a big ass dump in my toilet.
[342:44.81]And doesn't even flush it.
[342:47.19]He didn't even flush it.
[342:47.79]He just left.
[342:49.17]He didn't even wipe his ass.
[342:53.40]Thanks for the help.
[342:53.86]I appreciate the support that you just gave me.
[342:58.32]We were only fighting in the bathroom for an hour and ten minutes.
[343:03.64]That's plenty of time for you to run up behind him with a frying pan.
[343:11.75]okay so he's at work whatever harvest the money tree he needs to sleep or he's going to die so we need to do that first the chiefs will lose what is going on right now is there a big football game going on what that's like the third time somebody's asked me that question what's going on every game
[343:43.40]Oh, the Super Bowl is in February.
[343:45.02]That's right.
[343:46.54]That's true.
[343:53.50]Hey, how are my Chiefs doing?
[343:56.13]How are my Chiefs doing?
[344:12.78]What?
[344:12.94]What?
[344:14.14]Robert's on his way to an emergency, and the ambulance is stuck in an extremely congested area of Sim City surface roads.
[344:21.48]He's got the sirens on, but there isn't enough room for the cars to get out of his way.
[344:25.59]He could drive the ambulance on the sidewalk, or get out- What?
[344:35.05]Or get out and hoof the 25 blocks carrying his medpack.
[344:44.13]What happens if you drive on the sidewalk?
[344:48.80]Robert quickly discovers why most drivers choose not to drive on the sidewalk.
[344:53.63]That's because there are people walking on them.
[344:56.03]After nearly smashing into a man carrying an armful of rubber chickens and coming within an inch of hitting two men carrying a sheet of plate glass, he stopped by the local authorities and summarily, summarily, how do I say this word?
[345:10.43]Lean in.
[345:11.47]Summarily, summarily, what?
[345:13.85]How do I say this word?
[345:15.15]Summarily.
[345:16.51]Summarily?
[345:17.31]Summarily?
[345:19.74]Sumarely.
[345:20.80]Sumarely.
[345:22.88]I know a lot of words.
[345:23.68]I don't know that one.
[345:24.80]Relieved of his duties.
[345:25.66]Robert's been...
[345:49.35]Well, I didn't want to be a doctor anyways.
[345:56.67]See the ghost of Gerard.
[345:58.55]Why are these people... See the ghost of Jo... Why are these people dying?
[346:06.73]How many people are dying in this city?
[346:08.75]Okay.
[346:15.42]Alright.
[346:20.09]You know what?
[346:20.59]That's probably not a bad place to call it soon here.
[346:24.31]Alright, I have a question for all of you.
[346:27.01]We can do a poll.
[346:30.54]Would you like to see the Grootman household continue?
[346:38.48]And by would you like to see the Grootman household continue, would you like to see the Grootman household continue after
[346:49.50]The Infinity Nikki Slay Fit Showcase.
[346:57.90]And then finishing Nancy Drew.
[347:03.41]Both of those things I imagine will take probably an hour.
[347:10.21]I'm having fun.
[347:10.83]This is just fun to play it.
[347:12.69]Yeah, I mean, The Sims goes the same way pretty much every time, but it's always fun.
[347:17.91]Any of these old Sims games are just an old TV show that you know you've seen before, but the jokes still hit.
[347:22.57]Alright, cool.
[347:33.05]So the next time you'll see me live will probably be at some point at the end of this coming week.
[347:40.38]Maybe like Thursday?
[347:43.16]Let's go for Thursday.
[347:46.14]Maybe Wednesday.
[347:48.29]I kind of want to play it.
[347:49.35]I'm like into this right now.
[347:50.63]I don't, I don't know if I want to go more than another three or four days.
[347:56.67]Wednesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[347:58.38]Alright.
[347:58.66]Well, we'll just keep an eye on Sus.
[348:00.72]Wednesday, Thursday.
[348:01.32]Sounds good.
[348:06.96]Oh my God.
[348:07.46]98%.
[348:07.80]That's surprising.
[348:11.52]See you in four months.
[348:17.92]Hey.
[348:19.52]Hey, all of you that have been here for a really long time, remember this one?
[348:23.54]Let me make sure I save this.
[348:33.93]Okay.
[348:43.02]I theoretically should be able to stick it like this.
[348:47.55]Hey, look at that.
[349:02.46]All my assets are back loaded into the scene manager.
[349:06.08]Wow.
[349:11.66]Yeah, that'll be it.
[349:13.33]We'll check back on the Grootman house.
[349:16.11]Is that even their last name?
[349:19.75]Hope you had fun.
[349:21.13]I'm glad I actually got to play it.
[349:22.13]It's been a very long time.
[349:25.13]20 or so years since I've actually played it.
[349:26.73]I played The Sims 1 plenty of times, but The Sims 2 is just a little different.
[349:30.98]It's got a little more crust on it.
[349:32.22]I love it.
[349:34.56]Sims 1 has some crust too, but it's a lot of fun.
[349:49.55]Had fun?
[349:49.91]Good.
[349:51.99]You can play Hylics 2.
[349:54.27]We'll do Hylics 2 on just a chill night.
[349:56.82]Where I'm not really talking that much.
[349:58.30]Just kind of playing.
[350:07.50]Yeah, have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[350:09.79]Have a good night.
[350:11.37]Take care of yourselves.
[350:16.79]And...
[350:18.86]I have some more music here too.
[350:19.92]Oh, so another quick question before I go.
[350:32.23]After the intro of the stream, this should not have been a single pre-roll the entire stream for the five and a half, six hours or so.
[350:40.64]This should not have been one.
[350:44.39]Is that accurate?
[350:54.62]So if we... I guess if that's the case, then I'll keep doing it like this.
[351:06.49]Forces me to get up.
[351:08.27]So I think I'm okay with that.
[351:20.52]been good so far, it seems.
[351:22.03]As long as it's not impeding on any of the things on the stream, then I'm totally okay doing that then.
[351:40.56]Alright.
[351:41.08]Well, take it easy.
[351:42.24]See you later.
[351:43.28]Call your mother.
[351:43.88]Tell your mother that the fettuccine Alfredo, if you're still here, the person in the chat, tell your mother that you love that food.
[351:49.16]Tell your mother that, tell your mother you love what she does, okay?
[351:52.71]You know how happy that's going to make her?
[351:55.59]Knowing that she's feeding, she's feeding her growing boy, okay?
[352:06.11]Take it easy.
[352:12.26]you
[352:47.13]you
