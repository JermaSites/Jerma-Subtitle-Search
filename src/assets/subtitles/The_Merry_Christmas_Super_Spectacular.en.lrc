[04:34.43]Let me make sure.
[04:35.79]What is going on here?
[04:37.23]Hold on.

[04:45.10]Why did that happen?
[04:49.52]I hope that doesn't happen again.
[04:54.87]Alright, let's hope the audio works.
[04:56.31]This was such a pain in the ass to get to work, guys.
[04:58.61]You have no idea.
[05:01.00]This was like fucking ripping teeth out of my skull to get this to work.
[05:06.04]So we're gonna wait just a second.
[05:06.96]We're gonna let people trickle in here.
[05:08.10]And we're gonna get this started.
[05:10.29]Hopefully I can hear it.
[05:11.39]Hopefully you guys can hear it.
[05:14.41]You know what?
[05:14.91]On my phone, this is my iPad.

[06:25.02]No, no, no.
[06:26.46]I can't do that.

[06:51.33]We're going to start with the first one.
[06:53.63]They're in no real particular order.
[06:55.54]I just downloaded a shitload of them.
[06:58.76]Also, by the way, if you don't know from yesterday's stream... if you-
[07:03.87]Pre-recorded!? Oh yeah, is this pre-recorded?
[07:07.00]No, it's not. I- see what I just did there?
[07:10.00]Um, if you're using bits, make sure to add #charity to the uh to your bit message.
[07:18.00]Because... Twitch is just donating like two bucks I think for every certain amount of bits they- they- they're just giving money.
[07:26.00]So, if you're gonna use bits you might as well just add...
[07:32.47]Um, perfectly timed.
[07:36.00]You might as well just add uh #charity to all your bit messages because it's you know for doctors without borders.
[07:42.00]It's gonna- it's for a good cause, so make sure you do that but thank you guys very much for your bits and your subs.
[07:47.00]Let's open up the first one and I hope the audio works.
[07:49.00]And we're in it, we're opening.
[07:50.00]I don't know what this one is. Look at them there's a shitload of them.

[07:59.00]Alright. Can't hear it. Can I hear it?
[08:02.36]Oh, and there might be a really loud noise right now, so... Oh, hold on!
[08:06.67]Okay, cover your ears right now, I swear to God, I'm not kidding.
[08:11.21]Cover your ears.

[21:04.01]I just wanted to see what was going to happen.
[21:05.55]That's all I wanted to do.
[21:12.80]Santa parking simulator.
[21:14.50]Alright.
[21:15.26]We got to get through at least two videos.
[21:18.24]Three levels.
[21:19.36]Apparently, I can't even drive straight.
[21:20.99]That's a failure for sure.
[21:28.49]So many people are saying next.
[21:30.75]No, not yet.
[21:31.93]Not yet.
[21:32.38]We have to give him at least like two minutes each.
[21:36.02]Beer.
[21:37.04]How is this not correct?
[21:40.50]This is better parking than I could do.
[21:44.17]Oh, there we go.
[21:44.75]Beat it.
[21:46.25]Keep going.
[21:53.75]Ah.
[21:56.89]Next.

[22:08.62]Christmas.
[22:09.20]What's this one?
[22:09.72]This one.
[22:10.10]Christmas.
[22:10.70]Alright.
[22:14.04]Christmas.
[22:14.38]I think it looked like a roller coaster.
[22:19.36]Is this the game?
[22:22.44]Oh, shit.
[22:22.92]It's an ad.
[22:23.50]God damn it.
[22:25.74]Christmas Santa Roller Coaster.
[22:31.65]Winter Weather Alert.
[22:33.11]Okay, sure.
[22:39.27]We're all getting in as a family, okay.
[22:44.38]Move the throttle up to start the roller coaster, move the throttle down to stop the roller coaster.
[22:49.28]Speed should be low on sharp turns, okay.
[22:53.62]Where the hell the what?
[22:54.60]Oh, there it is.
[22:55.76]Is that, that's the throttle?
[22:56.76]I don't know, what kind of denomination is that, by the way?
[23:00.51]Like, it's just a, like, it's a pin.
[23:02.45]There's no audio, there's no sound!
[23:08.05]Wait, what?! !
[23:20.43]I can't believe this is a fucking game, man.
[23:44.50]I wanna beat this, I wanna beat this.
[23:46.79]Just take a picture, honey!
[23:48.79]Oh wait, that's camera angle change.
[23:53.20]These people look real bored.
[23:57.94]And look at this!
[23:59.96]These people are from different universes.
[24:02.28]The guy in the middle is a person, the girl in the back is an anime character.
[24:05.46]The person in the front is another cartoon character.
[24:08.37]They're all from different universes.
[24:10.15]They don't fit at all.
[24:11.39]They're not even supposed to be in the same place.
[24:15.16]I fell again.
[24:15.64]Alright, next.
[24:21.84]Christmas 3.
[24:24.05]Christmas 3 is this one.
[24:27.73]Okay, Christmas 3.
[24:30.41]Alright, this one looks pretty good.
[24:32.43]This one looks pretty fun.
[24:35.54]Watch full video ads to unlock cart.
[24:37.94]Nope.
[24:39.94]This is the one we're going to use.
[24:40.94]Play.
[24:51.21]I think this is another parking game.
[24:55.61]Yeah, I think it is.
[24:59.94]Maybe not.
[25:01.86]Make sure I don't accidentally hit the add.
[25:07.50]No, no, there's like other cars on the road.
[25:08.94]What am I supposed to be doing?
[25:15.26]I gotta go here?
[25:16.22]What is here?
[25:16.50]Why is there fireworks here?
[25:17.88]What does that mean?
[25:20.00]Oh, okay.
[25:26.83]No, we can't already say next.
[25:28.19]I need to know what the game is before we say next.
[25:36.91]There are people over here.
[25:37.81]Well, I guess they're happy about that.
[25:43.94]Oh, God.
[25:46.06]Hold on, let me just back it up.
[25:47.30]Hold on, I'm going to back it up.
[25:49.38]I'm stuck here.
[25:53.22]I can't move.
[25:53.72]Yeah, I'm stuck.
[25:55.89]Time's up.
[25:57.35]Yeah, you know what?
[25:58.15]You're right.
[25:59.07]Time is up for your fucking game.
[26:01.37]Next.
[26:03.73]Super Santa.
[26:04.39]Let's see what Super Santa is.
[26:13.50]Tap to continue.
[26:14.50]Oh, we're getting dramatic.
[26:16.80]Game Center... The same song from the other one.
[26:21.71]Christmas gift delivery game.
[26:25.24]Play.
[26:26.56]Oh my god.
[26:29.90]Why are they all the same game?
[26:31.50]Do they have to all be the same game?
[26:35.97]No.
[26:36.25]At least this one has a bigger map.
[26:39.47]Look, that's like a San Andreas map.
[26:44.39]I'm running into a cop car right now.
[26:46.29]I thought this was car select.
[26:49.03]No.
[26:49.71]This is not car select.
[26:50.67]This is just... Santa just sits in the back of the truck.
[27:00.39]Okay.
[27:02.01]Can you read that text?
[27:03.71]Follow the map and reach the distant.
[27:09.88]Oh, God.
[27:13.48]We're just going to back up.
[27:14.56]We're backing up because there's no way I'm going to be able to do this.
[27:19.51]Is that an ice cream truck?
[27:22.58]Hold on a minute.
[27:23.30]I didn't see the ice cream truck.
[27:25.86]Oh, would you fucking please get up there?
[27:29.38]Get up there!
[27:34.81]God, I'm about to next.
[27:35.93]I'm about to do it.
[27:36.77]I'm about to hit next.
[27:38.01]Like, you know what I'm saying?
[27:43.55]Fucking Jesus Christ.
[27:45.11]Hold on.
[27:47.72]Next.
[27:48.54]For sure.
[27:50.98]Alright, here we go.
[27:51.54]This one's called Intimate Fireplace.
[27:56.93]I'm getting so many pop-ups right now.
[27:59.69]No, I don't want push notifications.
[28:01.57]Excuse me.
[28:05.63]I don't get it.
[28:06.07]Okay.
[28:14.27]Okay.
[28:26.95]Okay, that's the whole game.
[28:27.96]Good.
[28:28.24]Okay.
[28:28.52]Well, that was fun.
[28:30.10]That was a fun game to play.

[28:34.48]Intimidate.
[28:35.32]Alright, this one's called Santa vs. Zombies.
[28:41.02]Choose your allegiance.

[28:47.63]Taco, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[28:49.23]I'll get to the bits in a second here.
[28:50.49]I just want to do this one.

[28:56.33]cannon upgrades damage this is like all in this font is freaking me out here uh choose your allegiance remove ads mega pack how do I play the game
[29:16.06]Known to the elves as the Dip.
[29:18.64]Their camp is located at the entrance to a toy mine due to the low aspect, possibly the least defendable position you're ever likely to encounter.
[29:31.07]So I'm the two elves and we're shooting like... What are we shooting?
[29:33.35]Do these guys have shotguns?
[29:39.26]This is not... Those frogs with shotguns.
[29:50.38]No, they have candy cans.
[29:51.18]I don't think they're even guns.
[29:52.01]No, they are guns.
[29:54.03]These people don't even have faces.
[29:59.23]What is that?
[30:07.77]Did you hear the Wilhelm scream?
[30:11.18]Oh shit, the cavalry!
[30:12.14]The fucking cavalry's here!
[30:21.75]and can't even, like... I can't even, man.
[30:27.07]Is that gonna kill us?
[30:28.63]Thank God.
[30:30.00]Double kill.
[30:39.06]We got our first quad kill, guys.
[30:40.36]That's a good thing, right?
[30:45.98]This was pretty fun.
[30:48.40]Turn up the in-game sound.
[30:49.50]I don't even think I can.
[30:55.54]At least these people have a cannon now.
[30:58.98]Fuck it.
[30:59.18]Let's just see what happens.
[31:02.14]It's so hard to aim this up without going so overboard.
[31:06.65]Did I beat it?
[31:08.63]There's one guy left, right?
[31:13.45]Wave one complete.
[31:14.25]Got it.
[31:18.69]No audio.
[31:19.45]Silent.
[31:23.21]Well, don't worry.
[31:25.95]We ain't going to be here for very long.
[31:35.42]We're done.
[31:36.14]We're out.
[31:39.08]New game.

[31:44.00]Santa Xmas.
[31:45.08]I don't know what this one is.
[31:47.78]We'll find out.
[31:52.32]Let's get intimate by this fireplace.
[31:55.86]This one's taking a long time to load, so... Alright.
[32:02.45]Another dancing Santa in a truck.
[32:03.95]That's good to know.
[32:05.37]There's real money involved in this one.
[32:06.73]That guy has really weird body proportions.
[32:18.92]I thought this was the game for a second.
[32:25.19]Shut up!
[32:25.95]Get me out of this ad!
[32:28.93]Ugh!
[32:32.95]I can't even skip this ad either.
[32:34.71]No, I almost just clicked to download now.
[32:41.02]Well, I do not want to download this now.
[32:42.48]I'd like to play this stupid, dumb Santa game.
[32:45.42]If this is a parking game, I swear... Santa Xmas gift delivery, again.
[32:48.82]Except... And he's dancing in the back of the car!
[32:52.33]What the fuck is with this?
[32:56.81]They must be the same people making this shit.
[33:01.49]I'm just, I'm dumping them.
[33:03.67]I'm dumping Santa Claus the first chance I get here.
[33:05.83]Is that a gas station?
[33:12.32]Hold on a second.
[33:15.00]Gas station.
[33:17.24]Gas station.
[33:23.10]Ugh, what?
[33:24.90]Come on.
[33:28.60]You can't put a gas station here and not let us explode it.
[33:35.17]That's- that's fucking... That's terrible.
[33:40.31]And it all... Where does this arrow even want me to go?
[33:47.67]Jesus.
[33:51.89]Oh, that was- yeah, that was so unsatisfying.
[33:58.86]Okay, come get the gifts.
[34:04.77]Look at how tiny his hat is.
[34:08.65]Nice, tight.
[34:09.17]Level up.
[34:13.05]Alright, level up.
[34:14.27]No, no, no, no.
[34:16.01]Next.
[34:18.71]This is Santa Brothers 3.
[34:21.97]It's upside down for me.
[34:25.39]This is, I can't see it.
[34:29.15]I have no idea what's going on.
[34:30.07]I have to turn the iPad around.
[34:31.31]Okay, there we go.
[34:34.63]What is this?
[34:39.88]That is the most terrifying Santa Claus I've ever seen.
[34:42.06]What do I do?
[34:48.00]He's not even part of the game world.
[34:49.33]He's just photoshopped plastered on top.
[34:51.25]That's the jump.
[34:51.75]Alright, let's go.
[35:03.41]Okay, you can stomp on the enemies.
[35:14.74]That Santa avatar is so good.
[35:18.90]I wish the camera wasn't so far to the right.
[35:20.68]I can't comprehend and pay attention to what I'm supposed to look at.
[35:23.38]Oh my lord.
[35:31.97]No, we got over the big pillar.
[35:33.59]That's a good thing.
[35:42.43]No, no, no, no, no.
[35:43.49]I'm still alive.
[35:44.57]No, I'm not.
[35:44.85]I'm dead.
[35:49.13]Okay.
[35:50.21]There's that one.
[35:53.75]You know what we're going to say, right?
[35:57.11]Next.
[36:02.54]Toy Factory.
[36:04.86]Toy Factory.
[36:08.60]This one actually looks like it has a little bit of polish to it.
[36:11.29]Santa's Toy Factory.
[36:13.41]Catch the presents before they hit the floor.
[36:17.15]Swipe up, down to move to the matching wrapping machine.
[36:23.85]Oh, shit.
[36:24.23]This one is very good.
[36:33.30]I get it.
[36:36.54]I think we found the first actual video game.
[36:41.54]I'm gonna get the fucking high score.
[36:46.75]Santa's Toy Factory.
[36:47.71]You guys know where to find it.
[36:48.81]Oh, the app store.
[36:51.33]Try to beat my high score of 10.
[36:54.35]Bet you can't do it.
[36:58.13]I'm gonna... You know what?
[36:58.71]Fuck... I better not see any next here.
[37:00.51]I'm gonna go until I lose.
[37:03.75]Get on that leaderboard, you know what I'm saying?
[37:06.51]Is there any more levels or is it just this?
[37:12.40]I think it's just this.
[37:18.00]Oh, hold on.
[37:19.18]I gotta get to 50.
[37:19.66]If I get to 50, I'll be happy.
[37:28.96]Oh!
[37:33.36]Give me 50.
[37:33.60]How am I supposed to?
[37:40.24]Oh shit!
[37:40.86]No, almost lost.
[37:41.46]Oh.
[37:46.75]No, I fucked it up!
[37:47.61]Next!
[37:47.93]Alright, moving on.
[37:52.51]We have, uh... This next one.
[37:55.75]Made with Unity.
[37:58.63]This one's called Crime Santa.
[38:03.51]Okay, let's... Loading, please, let's go.
[38:16.62]Look at how high this jump is.
[38:18.88]Does this game take place on the fucking moon?
[38:24.55]Oh, there's Santa.
[38:31.80]What do I do?
[38:32.36]Oh, hello, my little friend.
[38:35.92]Are you here to get some presents?
[38:38.22]Uh, I don't know.
[38:39.00]I'm not sure.
[38:39.68]Maybe.
[38:40.79]Sure you are, but I need you to do something for me first.
[38:44.39]My elves need a couple of phones so they can call me from anywhere.
[38:48.01]That person just drove off the road.
[38:49.83]Would you help?
[38:53.07]I can't refuse Santa.
[38:54.25]I'll do it.
[38:54.73]Uh, fuck your elves, Santa.
[38:58.13]There's a helicopter over here.
[39:02.57]Where's my gun?
[39:03.53]Do I have a gun?
[39:07.81]Oh shit, he's fighting back.
[39:08.57]Alright, you guys remember playing Crime Santa on Christmas?
[39:13.19]Wasn't that a great game?
[39:18.13]What the hell is this guy carrying?
[39:20.50]That's a cell phone.
[39:22.52]And like 1200 rounds.
[39:23.26]Okay.
[39:40.09]Hold on a second.
[39:50.35]I'm not done with this yet.
[39:53.41]I'm not done with this yet.
[39:56.67]Uh, put points in.
[39:57.61]Okay, good.
[40:02.54]No next.
[40:03.54]No, we're not doing next on this one yet.
[40:07.66]I see a car.
[40:08.56]Somebody just shot me.
[40:10.80]Who is shooting?
[40:11.36]Why are you shooting me?
[40:15.42]Get in the car.
[40:28.85]I just... I drove into a lamp post and the car exploded.
[40:33.05]Hold on.
[40:33.73]No.
[40:34.53]Not yet.
[40:35.31]Give me a second.

[40:38.46]How do I shut this fucking music up?
[40:43.14]Okay, there we go.
[40:44.74]Couldn't hear myself think.
[40:50.79]I don't have any weapons.
[40:52.81]I need to get at least one gun, you know?
[40:56.85]Gun in the trash can?
[41:00.13]No.

[41:33.36]Gas station.

[67:53.91]What led you to the North Pole?
[67:56.19]Hey, Grandpa, tell me where your leader is.
[67:57.99]Your suit has not taken a darker color.
[68:01.57]The young man ought not to say so.
[68:03.85]According to my records, you have always been a bad boy.
[68:06.25]They're just role-reversing.

[70:31.69]It really is the gorilla's Jeep.
[70:33.15]It's so loud.
[70:33.93]I'm so sorry.
[70:36.27]Ah, fuck.
[70:41.39]I need to run some people over.
[70:42.67]I don't think I even have a mission right now.
[70:45.69]I really don't think I do.
[70:56.80]I can't even run him over.
[70:59.84]Are you shitting me?
[71:00.74]Maybe I gotta go faster.
[71:01.64]Okay, I got him.

[71:42.31]Alright, we have to just drive into the gas station now.
[71:50.47]What the fuck?
[71:51.09]What's with this gas station bullshit?
[71:52.81]None of these gas stations explode.
[71:54.27]I think my car health is up there, by the way.

[73:01.74]It's always a car, right?
[73:14.30]Come on.
[73:15.64]There can't be that many assets in this game.
[73:17.40]No, it's another one of these.
[73:22.52]Do you want to unlock this cart?
[73:24.94]No.

[73:47.77]Look at how, like, loopy this one is.
[73:56.31]This one sucks.
[73:57.12]Never mind.

[75:11.12]Let's go get hit by the dumbbells.
[75:12.54]No, we can't.
[75:13.12]The car doesn't turn very well.

[76:32.48]This one.
[76:40.38]What do I do?
[76:41.08]I don't understand.
[76:44.22]I'm supposed to be shooting these things that come up here.
[76:50.73]Good luck.
[76:55.38]Are they aliens?
[76:56.24]I don't get it.
[76:56.64]They're getting a little closer.
[76:57.80]What are they?
[77:02.91]Can you see?
[77:03.43]I want to see what they are.
[77:04.25]They're like fucked up aliens.
[77:15.70]They're riding tricycles.
[77:17.84]They're aliens on tricycles.
[77:22.45]Santa is in a wheelbarrow.
[77:25.03]And he's shooting aliens that are riding tricycles.
[77:27.97]With a grenade launcher that is shooting plasma bullets.
[77:34.27]Well... Well... Are they Grinches?
[77:40.40]Are they actually... What's the purple?
[77:41.66]There's no purple Grinch.
[77:42.42]What are you talking about?
[77:45.18]I've never seen a purple Grinch before.
[77:50.60]Those are... Oh, they are Grinches.
[77:54.22]You won.
[77:58.45]I do it again.
[77:59.23]No.

[78:01.07]We stop.
[78:01.49]Um... Christmas Puzzle.
[78:24.59]Okay.
[78:25.07]Dressing up the Christmas tree.
[78:29.46]Dress up the Christmas tree.
[78:30.56]This one looks... Pick a character.
[78:34.40]Done.
[78:45.74]Okay.
[78:54.79]Okay, that one also sucks.
[78:56.55]Okay, that's two duds in a row.
[78:58.45]This next one looks promising.
[79:02.83]Choose your character.
[79:03.99]You have to choose between the two trees.
[79:06.75]This next one looks a little promising and I will see.
[79:18.46]Do I grab the sword?
[79:19.22]Am I supposed to do that?
[79:22.86]Green Xmas Hero.
[79:35.91]Okay, come on.
[79:36.75]Let's go.
[79:37.15]I've got all night.
[79:41.07]Okay, that's a Grinch.
[79:46.04]That's a Grinch with a battle axe.
[79:50.84]This is a League of Legends MOBA game.
[79:53.22]Look at the map.
[79:53.66]Take a look at the map.
[79:56.84]Are you shitting me?
[80:05.48]It's just like Dota.
[80:09.00]Are there creeps?
[80:10.52]I think there's creeps.
[80:14.07]Dude, that's not how you do it.
[80:16.29]You don't dive a tower at level 1.
[80:17.95]Wow, what a fucking idiot.
[80:23.24]What a dumbass.
[80:30.20]Dude, look at this.
[80:30.92]Look at this fucking polished ass MOBA.
[80:36.50]Let's get the tower.
[80:37.26]That's my one character weight I leveled up.
[80:42.44]Fire rain deals damage in a radius.
[80:46.38]In a radius.
[80:49.65]Put it, I don't know, put it here?
[80:53.35]No, shit, why is the tower shooting me?
[80:56.93]I thought the tower doesn't shoot you if there's minions there.
[81:01.07]What the fuck is this tower range?
[81:07.72]Is that like a jungle?
[81:09.62]What is that?
[81:10.14]How do I back?
[81:21.07]I can't believe this is a MOBA.
[81:25.05]Surrender at 20, Grinch is fed.
[81:32.38]Alright, I need to do a little experiment here.
[81:34.14]Is he gonna just dive the tower every time?
[81:37.26]Because his AI just doesn't exist.
[81:40.02]I think he will.
[81:41.54]Let's just walk him into the tower.
[81:44.63]Yep.
[81:46.51]Yeah, he's so desperate.
[81:48.61]His AI only knows how to do one thing.
[81:50.27]Attack hero.
[81:52.09]Okay.
[81:52.79]Now there's Christmas dogs now.
[81:54.99]Christmas dogs.
[82:10.54]Shit!
[82:11.58]Shit!
[82:13.68]Heal.
[82:15.76]Shield make your... Shield make your hero immune to damage for X seconds.
[82:22.98]Swift strikes deals damage to all enemies around hero.
[82:27.26]Heal hero for amount of health.
[82:29.10]We'll do that one.
[82:34.13]And then sets ballista that shoots enemies.
[82:38.32]Let's do, um... Make your hero immune.
[82:43.67]I'm not even sure I can do anything else anymore, so whatever.
[82:45.69]There's the heal.
[82:49.85]Is there a jungle?
[82:50.37]I'm gonna go to the jungle.
[82:51.03]I don't think there is a jungle.
[82:56.20]No, there's no jungle, and I'm... There's that one.
[83:00.56]Uh, Christmas AR.
[83:07.08]Christmas AR.
[83:10.22]Christmas may slow down your... Every single one of these has said that.
[83:12.94]That's so funny.
[83:18.44]Christmas AR would like to use the camera.
[83:22.99]Hold on a second.
[83:24.93]Hold on.
[83:25.25]This is going to be good.
[83:26.55]I just hope it's not facing my way because I don't have any pants on.
[83:30.72]Okay.
[83:31.22]Sure.
[83:32.54]Go ahead and use the camera.
[83:35.46]Point to the marker to view... No marker detected.
[83:38.84]Point to the marker to view the AR scene.
[83:41.64]You can find it at christmasar.brainingapps.com What?

[83:56.20]Rotate scene, vertical, horizontal, marker... What?
[84:01.32]Change scene...
[84:04.55]Where's my marker?
[84:05.36]What the fuck?
[84:07.62]Ugh.
[84:13.44]I have to actually print something out.
[84:18.64]Well.
[84:21.04]Never mind.
[84:24.47]Next.

[84:51.26]I don't even care.
[84:51.94]Fucking, just like, gee, I don't even care.
[84:55.63]Age.
[84:55.87]You're not getting my age.
[84:58.23]They won't like to build a profile on me.
[85:00.31]21, dude.
[85:00.63]Forever 21, you know what I'm saying?
[85:04.59]For the love of God.
[85:06.13]Another one of these.
[85:11.67]Okay, I got the enemies.
[85:12.47]Nice.
[85:13.68]Alright, personal stats.

[85:24.74]Alaska.
[85:28.27]More like 31.
[85:31.23]21 XDDD memes.
[85:34.25]Is that a meme?
[85:35.31]I wasn't aware.
[85:35.85]Alright, pick up the passengers and drop them off on their destination.
[85:38.99]Sir, you got it.
[85:43.95]This is a competing button.
[85:44.93]He's sliding over on the other side of the road.
[86:03.53]They don't know what to do if you fall off the edge.
[86:06.71]They didn't design it.
[86:08.07]So you just get an ad.
[86:09.29]I'm gonna try again.
[86:16.84]If it wasn't for this dickhead.
[86:17.78]Get on your side of the road.
[86:18.88]You're on the wrong side.
[86:19.68]Look at this guy.
[86:21.28]He's getting on the wrong side of the road.
[86:23.01]Get the fuck out of here.
[86:27.61]Nobody even driving that car.
[86:37.98]Okay.
[86:38.44]Pick up the passengers.
[86:39.14]We're the passengers.
[86:39.70]Right here.
[86:41.34]Fuck it.
[86:42.08]Run them down.
[86:43.30]You know that's what I was going to do.
[86:47.16]Of course they wouldn't let you do it.
[86:48.72]Why would they?
[86:52.10]Why would they let you run them over in this game?
[86:54.34]They just don't exist.
[86:56.62]Why is there a farm car?
[87:03.34]I'm knocking this guy off the fucking cliff.
[87:05.78]Sayonara, buddy.
[87:08.79]Go to hell.
[87:14.21]He's back on the road.
[87:19.44]Open the doors.
[87:26.00]Farm car.
[87:27.33]Yeah, buckle your seatbelts, ladies and gentlemen.
[87:31.75]They're not even in the car.
[87:33.61]That's so dumb.
[87:35.81]What the fuck is going on?
[87:37.11]He's still inside of me.
[87:49.25]Get me out.
[87:51.65]Dentist.
[87:54.69]Dentist would like to donate.
[87:55.59]No push notifications.
[87:56.49]We'd like to appreciate if you could leave us a review.
[87:58.67]No.
[88:00.71]Hey, Super Mario.
[88:03.75]Let's play.
[88:05.55]Mr. Santa Claus.
[88:07.11]Mrs. Claus.
[88:07.71]Snowman Grinch.
[88:09.53]Elf Scrooge.
[88:10.52]Gingerbread.
[88:11.18]It's going to go with Mr. Claus.
[88:15.42]Oh, God.
[88:18.53]Oh, God.
[88:19.21]Mr. Claus, you got some real... Why do I shake your device?
[88:33.02]What am I supposed to... Do I pull all of his teeth out?
[88:40.24]This is... Oh, God!
[88:42.27]Do I, like, brush his teeth?
[88:52.84]Get the drill!
[88:57.45]You need to rinse.
[88:58.11]Alright, give her a rinse, Santa.
[88:59.23]Very good.
[88:59.71]Very good job.
[89:00.43]Okay, we're done with this one.
[89:07.63]Just pulling Santa's teeth out.
[89:09.17]Great.
[89:10.37]This one, Santa's naked in this one.
[89:11.81]This is going to be good.
[89:16.93]Screwed.
[89:17.57]I don't care.
[89:17.97]Whatever.
[89:21.21]These are your character's stats, objectives, and limit.
[89:24.62]You can earn points by playing mini-games, okay?
[89:28.40]You need to get in shape for the high school reunion tomorrow.
[89:32.82]Scrooge needs to get in shape for the high school reunion.
[89:36.33]Let that sink in for just a second.
[89:41.77]Workout.
[89:42.75]Uh, sure.
[89:56.97]Tomorrow?
[89:57.60]I think you're a little late.
[90:04.42]You can't do this all in one day.
[90:06.10]You can't do this in a day.
[90:08.42]And have a little bit of spaghetti.
[90:15.53]Now, get this.
[90:17.93]Uh, fine.
[90:18.59]Do one of these.
[90:19.45]Yeah, he is like a fat fuck right now.
[90:22.75]You wanna get ready for the prom tomorrow?
[90:26.62]That's how we do it in the gym where I'm from.
[90:28.02]Yeah.
[90:32.30]Bye.
[90:36.42]Santa has a broken, a beat up face.
[90:41.50]Bravo, kids.
[90:42.49]Oh, Santa fell off a roof.
[90:55.29]She said that so happily.
[91:24.25]Rudolph ran into a tree and said- What happened to Rudolph?
[91:28.11]Is Rudolph okay?
[91:30.47]Is Rudolph okay?
[91:35.41]That's not how bones work!
[91:39.39]I gotta stick it with a syringe?
[91:42.93]Jesus Christ!
[91:45.67]This is not how you fix a broken nose!
[91:54.36]What the fuck am I about to do to Santa?
[91:59.60]What?
[92:00.64]What am I doing?
[92:01.42]Oh, my God.
[92:05.50]What the fuck?
[92:10.17]What am I doing here?
[92:16.33]Oh, Jesus God.
[92:17.95]Oh, my God.
[92:24.22]Okay.
[92:25.19]Okay, Santa's... Oh, there's his nose bone.
[92:32.73]We gotta fix it.
[92:36.29]Fix it.
[92:37.97]Fixed.
[92:38.55]Put some A and D ointment on there.
[92:41.12]Yeah, you'll be fine.
[92:42.12]Don't worry, Santa.
[92:46.54]Stick this in there, too.
[92:50.54]Oh, my God.
[92:51.34]Alright, suture him up.
[92:58.03]Set Rudolph right into a tree and set him fro- Hey, deoy!
[93:03.03]Rub it in.
[93:05.05]Alright.
[93:05.93]He should be healed up now.
[93:07.07]Cover him in gauze.
[93:13.17]Alright, we did it.
[93:17.76]Come on, we can move on.
[93:21.14]He's better now.
[93:23.90]So what else is there to do?
[93:27.42]There's more than one level?
[93:31.74]I'm not buying shit.
[93:32.88]Wait, what is it?
[93:37.29]What the hell is going on?
[93:41.69]Please be more careful.
[93:46.18]Do I have to watch an ad before every single surgery or something?
[93:56.79]Beat the whole game.
[93:59.63]Well, this ad is like playing.
[94:02.29]Thank you, Bill Nye for the sub.
[94:03.93]Sort of Stevie.
[94:04.77]Frozen crazy tuna for 10 months.
[94:06.61]Thank you, guys.
[94:07.25]Hold on.
[94:08.55]Level up.
[94:09.47]Alright.
[94:11.59]Level two.
[94:14.27]Santa fell down from the roof and broke his arm.
[94:20.36]I'm fucking, I'm done.
[94:22.26]I'm not doing this shit anymore.
[94:25.56]Alright, fuck that.
[94:28.04]That was a little too creepy for me.
[94:31.43]That was a little too weird.
[94:33.99]Uh, okay.
[94:35.47]What is this one?
[94:41.51]Uh, mommy.
[94:44.09]Why is there boogers coming out of it?
[94:55.87]Why does she have fucking boogers?
[94:59.11]How do I go?
[94:59.97]What do I do?
[95:01.85]What do I do?
[95:05.11]Okay, does anybody get what the fuck I'm supposed to do?
[95:11.05]What is going on?
[95:11.97]What?
[95:14.83]Why?
[95:20.58]Time for pregnancy checkup.
[95:26.62]I don't know, are you looking at a comb or hair?
[95:30.75]Get free, get free.
[95:35.27]What does this have to do with... Okay, just look, wait, look at the thumbnail for that one.
[95:43.81]Look, it's Santa giving an ultrasound to that lady.
[95:49.74]It's that's what that is.
[95:51.63]I don't know if I want.
[95:57.99]Look at fucking how creepy that looks.
[96:01.11]Look at how terrifying that is.
[96:05.15]We are going to do Santa gives mommy an ultrasound.
[96:07.57]We're going to move on from this one and do this one.
[96:12.51]Oh, Santa has a sword.
[96:16.67]Turn on location services.
[96:18.07]Oh yeah, you can get fucked.
[96:20.21]No.
[96:22.33]Not this again.
[96:22.93]Just crash into a wall.
[96:27.97]Alright, Santa has a sword.
[96:34.89]Look at this one.
[96:35.33]This one's like Legend of Zelda.
[96:37.71]It's really loud.
[96:38.61]There's the sword.
[96:48.87]Okay.
[96:55.65]How do I attack?
[96:56.29]Well, that's jump.
[97:02.44]Okay, I obviously can't attack.
[97:05.86]I need to get the sword.
[97:09.39]How many swords are on each level?
[97:20.07]Done.
[97:22.85]Okay, this one is Santa versus I Couldn't Read the Rest.
[97:28.59]Made with Unity.
[97:34.25]Arcade.
[97:40.17]Alfred Rudolph.
[97:42.37]Mr. Cookie.
[97:43.73]Santa.
[97:44.62]Or Mr. Snowman.
[97:48.02]I can't buy them.
[97:49.13]I can only use Elphina, apparently, because the rest cost money.
[97:53.91]Okay, let's go.
[97:54.69]Crossroads.
[97:55.35]Random.
[97:56.35]Sure.
[97:57.53]Select.
[97:58.93]Elphina versus Mr. Snowman.
[98:00.37]Is this a fighting game?
[98:08.70]I think this has to be a Street Fighter game, right?
[98:18.31]It's taking a very long time to load.
[98:24.76]Well, while this loads, I... Again, thank you to Sort of Steamy, Frozen Crazy Tuna for 10 months.
[98:31.20]Ewig X. No, hold on.
[98:35.26]This is the music from the trailer I made.
[98:38.62]From this vineyard.
[98:40.88]This vineyard.
[98:52.82]That's the trick right there.
[99:07.37]That's the move.
[99:07.83]You gotta do B. Come on.
[99:12.17]Got it.
[99:15.47]Snowman has legs.
[99:17.95]Round two.
[99:20.51]Yeah, this snowman should not have big, long legs like that, I agree.
[99:29.74]Come here!
[99:34.20]Oh, my God.
[99:35.06]Come on, that's it, right?
[99:35.96]I win.
[99:36.98]No, I don't win.
[99:38.50]Oh.
[99:46.82]Did you see how many times I pressed B?
[99:48.28]Here comes an ad.
[99:50.46]There's some nudity we're going to skip.
[99:51.90]Alright, we're getting down to the final four here, guys.
[99:57.71]We have Bouncing Santa, Santa Flight, Santa vs. Elf, and Santa Claus.
[100:04.31]Bouncing Santa.
[100:04.95]We're down to the final four.
[100:14.35]Don't care.
[100:17.21]Before we get to the final four, I have not been reading out subs and bits, so I want to catch up.
[100:24.64]Thank you, EwigX for the sub.
[100:26.60]Natini8, Martwain, LordOfNineGag, thanks for the three months.
[100:32.11]CrazyLizard92, thanks for the three months.
[100:35.61]Much appreciated, guys.
[100:36.63]CrazyLizard92, Rewalls, SwordDirty.
[100:39.49]I don't think I got these guys.
[100:43.05]JoeGaza?
[100:43.46]No, I got JoeGaza.
[100:45.72]I got you guys.
[100:47.67]On the bit front, we have bits from Crodon, who says, Frosty has been hit leg day hard.
[100:54.09]The Mightiest of Beards, thanks for the bits.
[100:55.53]Croacher, again, game sucks.
[100:58.27]He wasn't even doing full range of motion.
[101:02.53]Doomshroom, 54, thanks for the bits.
[101:04.43]Sea Bass, thanks for the bits.
[101:07.76]Dirac, thank you for the bits.
[101:09.06]Crodon, again, Crodon gave a lot tonight.
[101:12.02]Gave like a thousand or something earlier too, didn't he?
[101:16.14]The Shadow Boats, thank you for the $10.
[101:18.77]Much appreciated, dude.
[101:21.03]Dane Tech Gadget Guy, thank you for the 500 bits.
[101:23.31]You guys rock.
[101:27.63]Thank you, guys.
[101:29.76]And then Z990TV with 265 says, yo, Merry Christmas.
[101:33.56]Hey, Merry Christmas to you, too.
[101:36.12]Sam, also Sam N, gave $6.65.
[101:40.59]The fact that you decided to stream 41 Christmas mobile games just makes me so happy.
[101:47.03]There were some gems in here, and there's still four left, so there's still plenty of time.
[101:51.82]There were some gems in here for sure.
[101:54.14]My pleasure.
[101:55.60]Let's go.
[101:56.04]Bouncing Santa.
[102:05.76]This is fucking awful.
[102:14.79]What the fuck is... What?
[102:15.81]What the fuck?
[102:16.25]I just did it.
[102:16.59]I did it right.
[102:17.73]Stop.
[102:21.03]Two ads in a row.
[102:26.83]You have to keep him bouncing on the trampoline and collect presents.
[102:34.08]This is taking over my computer right now.
[102:39.42]Do you like this app?
[102:40.52]There's a problem.
[102:42.88]There's a problem.
[102:47.07]I'm an independent developer and don't always catch every bug in the app.
[102:49.83]If you let me know what the issue is, I'll do in my power to correct the issue.
[102:52.67]Thanks for your understanding.
[102:58.63]This is a fun one.
[102:59.91]Let's give the guy a break.
[103:00.97]This is a fun little game.
[103:04.41]Next.
[103:06.79]Santa Flight.
[103:11.64]Santa Flight Simulator.
[103:14.60]These are buttons, but I don't know what they say.
[103:18.86]Game Center is not available.
[103:20.00]I don't know what these buttons do.
[103:24.13]Hopefully that was play.
[103:28.25]Okay.
[103:29.35]Sure.
[103:37.54]That's how you get them to move, okay.
[103:41.26]How do I go in the air?
[103:42.04]How do I go in the fucking air?
[103:49.95]Go in the air!
[103:53.79]How do you go in the air?
[103:55.26]Oh my god, please, get in the air!
[104:07.66]Hold on, hold on, they're moving.
[104:08.78]No, they're not.
[104:11.10]I lied.
[104:11.44]They're just in the ground.
[104:19.79]He lost.
[104:24.95]I need to, I want to get in the air.
[104:34.22]Pull up?
[104:36.10]I don't think I can.
[104:40.94]break his nose.
[104:41.98]Rudolph crashed and Santa broke his nose.
[104:46.46]I'm flying.
[104:52.48]I did it.
[104:53.40]I flew for five seconds.
[104:59.88]Now we're going into the mountain.
[105:04.27]Santa did not do this right.
[105:08.03]Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[105:08.85]Going in the air.
[105:09.97]Maybe getting some takeoff here.
[105:11.21]No, get the fuck... Get out of here.
[105:17.53]Psycho Bear Studios.
[105:19.03]That's a good sign.
[105:24.55]Santa vs. Elf Zombies.
[105:27.27]Weak zombie.
[105:29.05]Health 100, damage 5.
[105:31.02]Tilt to move, tap... This is gyro controls.
[105:36.30]What was it?
[105:36.72]What was shoot...
[105:41.27]I don't know what shoot was.
[105:42.07]I have to tilt my iPad.
[105:47.66]This is so stupid.
[105:56.27]Merry Christmas everybody!
[106:09.33]This is kind of... Grenade.
[106:13.37]Throw a grenade.
[106:14.17]Shoot missiles.
[106:15.41]Heal.
[106:19.13]I'm getting hit.
[106:23.33]I'm dead.
[106:24.16]Would you like to resurrect your Santa with one life?
[106:25.98]I would not, actually.
[106:27.44]I would not want to do that.
[106:29.92]Ladies and gentlemen, we've made it to 41.
[106:32.38]This is the final game.
[106:35.94]This is Santa Claus dot dot dot.
[106:43.03]Let's see what it is.
[106:43.49]Santa Claus the Witch Hunter.
[106:47.71]It seems real far away to press that start.
[106:52.58]Jesus Christ.
[106:55.04]What?
[106:56.84]How do I control it?
[106:58.74]How do I control it?
[107:07.87]I don't understand how you control...
[107:13.64]Is it up and down?
[107:18.10]Okay, it's inverted.
[107:20.18]It's inverted.
[107:20.92]It's inverted.
[107:24.97]We got it.
[107:26.79]Merry Christmas, everybody!
[107:28.25]Happy New Year!
[107:30.99]Wait, there's the lady.
[107:32.51]There's the witch.
[107:36.59]It's just like Star Wars Rogue Squadron.
[107:41.93]Was this the 99 cent game?
[107:43.51]No, alright, here's what we're gonna do.
[107:44.75]Was that a guy on my team?
[107:47.87]Get her!
[107:48.99]Did I just crash?
[107:52.59]I just crashed directly into somebody else.
[107:54.66]She just died too.
[107:57.48]I gotta get this.
[108:00.06]I've gotta get the witch.
[108:01.80]I've gotta get the witch.
[108:04.74]Next!
[108:05.10]Hey, there is no next, by the way, guys.
[108:08.27]This is it.
[108:09.73]There is no more next.
[108:15.54]Jesus.
[108:18.51]I gotta win the first level.
[108:25.43]Where'd she go?
[108:30.69]Is that... Okay, that looks like a power-up.
[108:32.88]No, it's not a power-up.
[108:35.54]Why do I... Okay, for one second of my brain, this was multiplayer and that guy was on my team.
[108:40.66]Something's hitting me from behind.
[108:42.75]Da-ha-ha-ha-ha.
[108:44.61]Easy, Santa.
[108:45.33]Easy, Santa.
[108:54.81]Where did they go?
[108:55.35]This is so sloppy.
[108:57.79]I just can't even tell where the fuck they are.
[108:59.33]There's one right there.
[109:02.41]Line it up.
[109:06.60]She just crashed.
[109:08.00]Into the wall.
[109:09.24]By the... By the... Okay, I'm fucking... Let's just watch for a second.
[109:19.52]Let's just watch these idiots play.
[109:33.71]The never-ending spawning.
[109:36.99]There's no game here.
[109:38.83]They just drive around aimlessly and crash into stuff.
[109:45.84]Let's see.
[109:46.44]Let's see if there's any more Santas.
[109:51.66]That same guy.
[109:54.43]Let me join the battle.
[109:59.13]Ugh.
[110:02.69]Rudolph crashed and broke his nose.
[110:05.59]That was so funny.
[110:08.01]Well, there it is, guys.
[110:10.03]There's your 41 fucking terrible iPad games.
[110:12.95]Here's the deal.
[110:15.37]Which one of these games?
[110:17.11]Are you guys ready?
[110:18.54]Here's the game of the night.
[110:21.32]Which one of these games, the only one, cost money?
[110:26.76]One of these 41 games was $1.
[110:30.00]Which one is it?
[110:31.90]What do you think?
[110:35.85]One dollar.
[110:43.05]I'll give you a minute and we'll see what you guys think.
[110:45.89]The mommy one.
[110:46.66]Mommy.
[110:48.96]That's so creepy.
[110:50.46]I'm so scared to click that again.
[110:54.00]Santa gives mommy an ultrasound.
[110:56.14]The roller coaster one.
[110:57.82]The fireplace.
[110:58.60]No.
[111:01.71]I'll tell you in a second.
[111:02.73]I'll open it.
[111:04.44]I'll open it.
[111:05.20]And then we'll see with the one that was one dollar.
[111:11.56]Surgeon Simulator Christmas one.
[111:16.33]No.
[111:16.87]Alright.
[111:17.15]You guys ready?
[111:18.75]I'm going to open the one that was one fucking dollar.
[111:21.89]You ready?
[111:22.15]Here we go.
[111:38.79]This game was a dollar.
[111:41.39]The only game that cost money was this one.
[111:48.65]Ah, what value!
[111:50.95]Unbelievable!
[111:51.98]Yeah.
[112:08.14]That's the one that was $1.
[112:09.02]Didn't have any ads, that's right.
[112:15.70]Was it worth it?
[112:16.44]I think so.
[112:18.51]Okay, I'm telling you right now, this book is all over my body.
[112:21.77]Like, the amount of times I was laughing at some of these games, I was already getting over being sick.
[112:28.05]I am a mess right now.
[112:31.88]Oh, boy.
[112:34.24]But, uh...
[112:37.03]That's all I had planned for a Christmas stream.
[112:40.47]So, I think that's going to be it.
[112:44.59]I just wanted to do something different and weird and hopefully it was interesting enough.
[112:52.38]I will be back on Tuesday.
[112:58.30]Go play New Vegas.
[112:59.82]No, I got Christmas stuff to get ready for.
[113:02.92]I wanted to get this stream out there.
[113:08.21]Literally missed the whole thing.
[113:09.69]How long was that?
[113:10.29]It was like, what, like two and a half hours?
[113:12.12]Two hours and like 25 minutes?
[113:13.20]That's actually longer than I thought it could have been.
[113:19.18]Make a Christmas movie.
[113:26.32]Yeah, this wasn't that long, but I actually didn't plan on a very, very long stream to begin with, so.
[113:34.72]It felt like an eternity.
[113:36.26]I had fun, though.
[113:42.04]That was worth it for me.
[113:43.90]A lot of these games are fucking just outrageous.
[113:45.52]My favorite... Okay, let's talk about favorites.
[113:48.86]Gonna have to go with... Santa Car Park, the first one.
[113:58.33]And Santa Avengers is probably my... And the third favorite would be Green Xmas.
[114:07.56]Although Santa has a sword was pretty fantastic.
[114:13.43]You make me sick to my stomach.
[114:19.47]Well, thank you, guys.
[114:21.13]Some people just gave fucking a shitload of money.
[114:23.23]Hold on a second.
[114:24.09]Dane Tech.
[114:25.15]First of all, Darren J., thanks for the $3.
[114:28.36]They say charity.
[114:29.08]Thanks for the stream.
[114:30.20]Thanks for sticking around, dude.
[114:30.94]Thanks for the $3.
[114:32.50]Dane Tech with $50.
[114:35.10]Next.
[114:37.28]Wait, what?
[114:39.36]Thank you, Dane Tech, for the 5,000 bits.
[114:41.78]That's a lot of Christmas bits.
[114:46.68]Thank you so much, dude.
[114:50.68]Everybody say hi to Daintek for his extremely large amount of money.
[114:55.70]And there was another large... There was a $100 donation, bit-wise, a couple hours ago, too.
[115:02.09]Wait, what?
[115:03.49]Guys are in the Christmas spirit, apparently.
[115:05.03]You guys rock.
[115:06.65]Will Sarcasm, thank you for the $1,500 Merry Dollar Flight game.
[115:12.36]Yeah, it was the best one.
[115:16.04]Sing us a Christmas song.
[115:21.22]Some of that was, it slayed me.
[115:24.82]I'm going to have a nice rest tonight.
[115:28.10]But doctor recommended.
[115:29.36]Thank you for the 3,000 bits, dude.
[115:31.92]30 bucks.
[115:33.98]Just like that.
[115:34.62]And they say charity.
[115:36.51]Very nice of you.
[115:37.61]Hopefully a large portion of that will be going to Doctors Without Borders.
[115:41.65]So very good of you.
[115:43.75]Very kind of you.
[115:46.19]Batman, thank you for the 760.
[115:47.50]Happy holidays, Jermo.
[115:48.28]Happy holidays to you too, man.
[115:49.78]Thanks for the 760.
[115:52.58]Renegade Coaster for 10 bucks.
[115:54.08]That was an amazing stream.
[115:55.14]Thanks.
[115:55.38]Well, it was... Wait, what?
[115:57.70]It could have gone either way, right?
[115:58.92]Like, some of that shit, like, this whole thing could have been fucking terrible.
[116:04.25]And I mean terrible as in, like, not funny.
[116:06.99]Just not even fun.
[116:09.29]But out of the, like, 40 games that were here, at least, like, 16 to 20 of them were fucking hilarious for me.
[116:16.35]So I think it was a... I enjoyed myself, and that's...
[116:21.32]All I got to say about that.
[116:23.60]It was fun for me.
[116:24.82]Hopefully it was fun for you too.
[116:27.36]But thanks again, man.
[116:29.92]Also, thanks to Will Sarkar.
[116:33.02]What?
[116:35.08]Dane Tech again gave 30 bucks five minutes ago or so.
[116:38.76]Thanks a lot, Dane.
[116:41.73]Dane, you're a fucking madman.
[116:44.89]Pants, Fern and Dad, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[116:46.33]Merry Christmas, happy holidays.
[116:47.31]Thanks for all the streams.

[116:59.76]Merry Christmas.
[117:00.38]Thanks for the content this year.
[117:01.59]Well, thanks for sticking around for the whole year, man.
[117:05.89]And then Magpie with a thousand bits.
[117:07.85]Merry Christmas, Turnbull.
[117:08.69]You're honestly my favorite dude on the internet.
[117:10.21]Oh, that's fucking extremely kind to you.
[117:14.85]You gotta make me cry, Magpie.
[117:16.78]Thanks a lot, dude.
[117:20.63]Man, you guys, is it because it's Christmas time?
[117:25.32]It's Christmas time.
[117:26.04]I'm getting spoiled on Christmas.
[117:28.10]You guys are too much.
[117:31.46]Much love, dudes.
[117:33.58]Thank you for the generous bits and subs and everything.
[117:39.03]And with that, Mellow Master 1080, thanks for the sub.
[117:42.41]Wager, thanks for eight months.
[117:43.37]Blue Kunu for three months.

[117:52.35]Thanks, dude.
[117:54.41]I eat cavemen.
[117:56.95]Heretic anchorite.
[117:58.34]Thanks, man.
[117:59.56]For 11 months.
