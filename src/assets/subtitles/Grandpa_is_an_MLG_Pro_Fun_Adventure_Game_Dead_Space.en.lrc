[00:05.47]Hello there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07.53]Welcome to episode 12 of Grandpa the MLG Pro.
[00:13.54]And a lot of you might be probably wondering, where the hell did I go for the last, like, three weeks?
[00:18.96]And the answer's pretty simple.
[00:21.00]I went on vacation with my family, and I got deported from Rio de Janeiro because I had, like, sex with 28 prostitutes.
[00:30.66]In the same room, by the way.
[00:32.16]Let's not forget that little tidbit.
[00:34.47]So I'm back in the United States of America, and we're going to play Dead Space.
[00:40.96]Now I don't know that much about this game, but I do know two very important things.
[00:45.72]Number one, we're about to fucking crash.
[00:48.01]And number two, this looks like it's gonna be a really fun adventure game.
[00:53.01]Where you solve puzzles, and you fucking talk to people and shit.
[00:57.03]So this is gonna be a real laid-back fun time.
[01:01.12]Okay, let's go solve a mystery, my little mystery friends.
[01:05.86]How come I have a helmet on?
[01:08.09]Why does nobody else have one of these?
[01:10.28]What do I take a fucking Darth Vader?
[01:12.30]This is stupid.
[01:14.18]Look it, nobody else has a goddamn helmet.
[01:16.24]Why do I have the only fucking helmet on?
[01:19.22]Okay, we gotta find the clues to see who just killed Mary J. Stevenson.
[01:26.36]I think I might have found a clue over here.
[01:29.61]And, what?
[01:31.55]Hold on, what do I have to do here?
[01:34.19]Locator.
[01:35.70]Oh, apparently you can see through walls and stuff.
[01:38.45]What the hell is this?
[01:40.27]Okay, let's go in here.
[01:41.29]Let's find the secret.
[01:42.85]To who this... Oh, my God.
[01:47.80]I'm starting to think that this might not be the game I initially thought it was going to be.
[01:52.88]And I... What the fuck is going on?
[01:55.89]What the hell was that?
[01:57.29]What is going on here?
[01:59.63]What's with the alarm?
[02:00.53]Turn the alarm off.
[02:01.35]There's no cause for concern.
[02:03.60]What is this game?
[02:04.98]What is this fucking game?
[02:07.16]What the hell?
[02:08.02]What is fucking going on?
[02:09.98]What is that?
[02:11.40]What is that fucking thing?
[02:13.34]That poor guy.
[02:15.28]Oh, God.
[02:17.60]Okay.
[02:18.53]This is just a cutscene.
[02:20.51]I don't have to play.
[02:21.55]I can turn it off and...
[02:24.02]What?
[02:25.62]Wait, what?
[02:26.84]What are you?
[02:27.82]Oh, are you fucking kidding me?
[02:30.41]I thought this was going to be an adventure game, but no, it turned out to be a goddamn horror game.
[02:35.29]Of course, what the fuck is wrong with me?
[02:37.98]Oh, I got away.
[02:39.10]I actually got away.
[02:41.02]Fuck this game, man.
[02:42.06]Seriously, I... Oh!
[02:45.11]I just shit my pants.
[02:46.55]I actually just shit my fucking pants.
[02:49.01]Oh, this is disgusting.
[02:50.31]Fuck.
[02:51.72]Why would they do that to you?
[02:53.22]Hey, hey.
[02:54.62]Are you alright in here?
[02:55.52]Get out of here.
[02:56.40]I'm fine.
[02:57.22]Why does it smell like shit?
[02:59.20]You must have farted.
[03:00.12]I don't know.
[03:00.50]I gotta get out of here.
[03:01.27]I gotta take a shower.
[03:02.21]What?
[03:02.39]You're not playing that fucking game ever again.
[03:05.85]I tell you that.
