[00:02.61]Hey, what's up?
[00:04.43]Sorry, I'm late.
[00:05.25]I had to come up with a funny title.
[00:09.96]I'm sitting here going, I gotta think of a funny title.
[00:13.30]And I came up with one.
[00:14.68]I came up with one.
[00:15.38]I think it's kind of funny.
[00:23.79]Took you 15 minutes.
[00:24.65]Yeah, I've got to come up with a title.
[00:31.69]I thought it was VRJosh.
[00:34.15]Nah.
[00:35.41]Nah, nah.
[00:36.73]Nah!
[00:41.93]Yeah, it was.
[00:47.14]What the hell is going on right now?
[00:50.94]What is this?
[00:51.38]Why is there a purple box over people's messages?
[00:54.74]What is this?
[01:01.92]First time chat.
[01:05.66]What is this?
[01:06.70]I don't want this.
[01:08.64]How do I delete this?
[01:09.90]Immediately.
[01:10.81]I want to delete this immediately.
[01:13.35]Are the edibles kicking in?
[01:17.11]No, dude.
[01:19.09]Alright, fucking stop.
[01:20.85]Since I turned 37, it's been nothing but weirdo streams.
[01:24.65]I have to stop being weird.
[01:27.63]I'm going to be fucking quiet for the next hour.
[01:36.23]But no, is this a new chat appearance?
[01:40.89]Why do you sound like... You don't sound like the real Jerma.
[01:43.39]Well, it's because I'm a little winded because I was running around the house.
[01:52.02]I was... Okay, you know that you're late for something when you start taking corners in your own place.
[01:58.54]You understand that?
[02:03.13]But I'm taking corners.
[02:09.90]I had to get my tea.
[02:10.66]My tea wasn't even ready.
[02:17.34]Why were you running?
[02:20.58]I'll be fine.
[02:20.94]Just give me a minute.
[02:24.46]You made us weird, Sad.
[02:27.00]What?
[02:32.16]Don't you guys understand that I'm like the...
[02:35.76]You come observe me.
[02:37.62]You don't want to be like me.
[02:38.66]Come observe me.
[02:39.70]Be like, I don't want to be like that guy.
[02:44.04]I'm going to do good in school.
[02:56.49]Observe.
[02:57.07]How are you?
[02:59.77]I'm doing good.
[03:00.23]I'm doing good.
[03:03.09]Sorry we delayed a couple of days, but you know, it happened.
[03:11.16]Actually, we should go over this because it's important.
[03:13.96]So today we're going to stream here.
[03:15.76]Listen.
[03:17.72]We're going to do Splatoon 3.
[03:21.27]And then after that, Breath of the Wild.
[03:27.81]And then on Sunday, we'll take a break from the Switch.
[03:36.00]Why did you delay?
[03:36.75]I don't know.
[03:41.29]I woke up on the wrong side of the bed the last couple days and I was like, nah.
[03:44.67]I had to take care of a few things too.
[03:48.49]Alright, I literally ran around.
[03:52.13]Let me just not be winded for one second.
[03:54.52]Listen to this voice.
[03:55.18]What's going on?
[04:00.12]No, I had to.
[04:01.12]There were some things I had to take care of.
[04:07.86]Yeah, what's going on with my voice?
[04:10.23]I promise you, it was not like this five minutes ago.
[04:16.37]Sorcery Sunday?
[04:17.41]Um... I don't know.
[04:19.95]I want to get away from the Switch for a little bit, though.
[04:28.04]Is it allergy season?
[04:29.26]It actually might be.
[04:31.98]Did you hear?
[04:32.34]I just fake sniffed.
[04:34.00]You just implanted that in my head.
[04:36.28]Did you hear that?
[04:36.90]I hope you did.
[04:40.96]Did that come through?
[04:44.83]I was like, oh, you know, maybe, maybe.
[04:51.73]He's allergic to streaming.
[04:53.51]No.
[04:53.85]Alright, yeah, we're going to play Splatoon 3.
[04:56.91]Let me tweet, though.
[05:00.86]Sounds good.
[05:01.44]Okay.
[05:02.00]Okay.
[05:10.25]Um, I don't really know how to play Splatoon.
[05:15.27]It started with motion controls and I turned that off.
[05:24.34]I did the tutorial and I made my squid.
[05:27.96]Here, look, I'll just show you whatever.
[05:37.13]Apparently, you can make different... Hold on.
[05:40.75]Can you guys hear it?
[05:43.84]There we are.
[05:44.16]I don't know how any of this works.
[05:49.94]This is my character.
[05:56.94]And this is... Are these players?
[06:04.81]Are they?
[06:06.25]They are.
[06:12.90]Okay, how's that?
[06:13.70]Wait, so this is a player right here.
[06:24.07]Why are they NPCs?
[06:33.93]It's not in real time.
[06:35.35]Ah, okay, okay.
[06:36.51]Alright, so where do I go?
[06:42.94]I took off... I don't want to do motion controls.
[06:44.70]I don't want to do it.
[06:50.68]I'll be... Okay, let me be very, very upfront with everybody.
[06:55.02]I installed Splatoon 3 and made this character and then never opened it again.
[07:04.38]God, it's had to have been at least three weeks.
[07:07.24]It's had to have been at least two weeks, at least.
[07:10.03]I don't, I have no idea.
[07:12.29]Alright, go to the menu.
[07:14.15]Lobby?
[07:16.49]Stages?
[07:17.17]Ooh, okay, regular battle.
[07:23.33]Anarchy battle?
[07:25.37]What's Salmon Run?
[07:28.35]Turn on drawings, you coward.
[07:33.97]Story mode?
[07:39.21]Do salmon run.
[07:40.01]Yes, yes, yes.
[07:41.43]How do I do this?
[07:44.84]I should do this right now?
[07:47.46]No, this is definitely hard mode.
[07:49.06]I'm not doing hard mode right now.
[07:53.32]Alright, let's just do lobby.
[07:58.32]How can we look plastic today?
[08:04.18]I mean, I don't feel plastic.
[08:07.75]Welcome to the lobby.
[08:08.43]It's your portal to online battles and where you stash all your gear.
[08:13.13]As you splat forth in online battles, you'll level up and earn cash.
[08:17.77]Why level up and get cash?
[08:19.01]So you can access gear.
[08:22.03]And some battle modes are restricted to players at a higher level.
[08:24.05]Okay.
[08:26.31]Why don't you check out the battle pod?
[08:30.79]Okay.
[08:33.29]Less chat, more splat.
[08:34.29]That's what I mean.
[08:37.70]Oh.
[08:40.22]When you play online, your nickname and player data may be made public.
[08:47.24]Okay.
[08:48.44]Alright, let's vote this way.
[08:53.44]Okay, those are taunts.
[08:57.80]Let me just do a regular fight.
[08:59.36]I'm going to be the literally bottom bragging person, but that's fine.
[09:06.30]Okay.
[09:11.82]Bro, what's your haircut?
[09:13.82]Uh, the haircut is a 37-year-old man that has not been to a hair salon in two and a half months.
[09:19.04]That's it.
[09:21.28]And sometimes shaves.
[09:23.84]Sometimes shaves.
[09:27.76]Alright, let's go.
[09:28.44]Both headphones in.
[09:33.69]Which one is me?
[09:36.30]You!
[09:36.64]That's me!
[09:40.70]What the fuck?
[09:42.20]I don't know how to play.
[09:43.02]I actually don't know how to play.
[09:44.78]Is there a sprint?
[09:48.36]Okay, that's... How do I... How do I, um... How do you do the squid move when you jump in the squidding?
[10:02.37]Oh, yeah!
[10:03.15]First frag!
[10:23.08]Do I have to, like, paint the ground?
[10:28.49]What?
[10:31.03]Wait, you can hide.
[10:31.65]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[10:41.87]There's different weapon loadouts, too.
[10:48.98]What's that?
[10:50.22]Oh, grenade.
[11:11.75]I think I'm doing okay.
[11:12.51]Am I doing good?
[11:13.09]Is that a player?
[11:15.87]Who is that?
[11:16.23]Alright.
[11:17.51]Shoot the... Ink the ground.
[11:18.49]Shoot the ground.
[11:18.89]Shoot the ground.
[11:19.35]Okay.
[11:24.74]Shoot the ground?
[11:25.34]I mean, the whole ground is green.
[11:41.93]What the fuck is this crap?
[11:58.61]What the hell is that?
[11:59.49]Should I pick this up?
[12:04.54]What the fuck was that?
[12:32.48]Is there a healer?
[12:35.91]How do I check the stats?
[12:37.81]Press right stick.
[12:41.69]That was actually kind of fun.
[12:44.21]That was actually pretty fun.
[12:45.61]I enjoyed that.
[12:46.13]That was fun.
[12:50.05]Alright, so we lost.
[12:53.22]What happened?
[13:02.11]That's the first time I've ever played the game.
[13:06.59]So it's only based on what's on the ground, that's it?
[13:13.30]Cool.
[13:15.46]It was basically a 3v4.
[13:16.48]Okay, in that mode.
[13:19.82]Alright, that's what battles are like.
[13:22.25]Did you happen to notice how some of your opponents had cool looking name displays?
[13:26.15]They're called splash tags and they're fully customizable to show off your personality.
[13:30.70]Wait, you haven't even set up a nickname for your splash tag yet?
[13:35.70]You gotta show up in style to your next battle.
[13:40.73]What do you want to call yourself?
[13:43.35]Yeah, we'll see.
[13:45.45]I want it to be a reveal.
[13:46.87]I don't want you guys to see it.
[13:51.09]What should I call myself?
[13:58.77]What's the objective?
[14:20.77]That's so bad.
[14:21.51]It's the worst nickname I've ever seen.
[14:25.53]Is this permanent?
[14:30.93]Is it permanent or?
[14:34.15]Alright, hold on.
[14:37.47]No, okay, okay, that's alright.
[14:41.31]Do you know you can use the Sheldon license you got on shiny new weapons?
[14:46.25]I can't wait till you guys see what I did.
[14:49.88]Ammo Knights, okay.
[14:54.36]Swap.
[14:56.48]Okay, cool.
[14:58.70]So the whole goal with Splatoon is you want to get more paint on the ground.
[15:02.81]Oh, this is cool.
[15:04.15]What's the range on this shit?
[15:05.25]Let me, hold on.
[15:05.85]Let me see something.
[15:07.69]Alright.
[15:07.89]So this is, it's a massive arc.
[15:12.79]So you realistically need to be really close.
[15:19.60]LZ makes you fly around.
[15:21.70]That's also how you get more ink, right?
[15:25.50]Get a new weapon.
[15:28.87]Try the charger.
[15:29.60]Alright, how do I, uh... That's not my name.
[15:35.40]My name's not Splattershot Jr.
[15:37.10]I know a lot of people probably think that.
[15:39.79]How do I buy a new weapon?
[15:43.03]Let's go to the ammo shop, right?
[15:50.98]Grab a bite.
[15:53.27]Hello there.
[15:53.67]Welcome.
[15:54.37]This is your first time here, isn't it?
[15:55.67]How splendid.
[15:56.17]I do hope you become a regular here at the Crab and Go.
[16:00.07]This voice is stunlocking me.
[16:01.81]I can't even think.
[16:03.01]What did it say?
[16:04.18]Crab trap sandwich.
[16:06.02]Okay, so this is probably cost real money or something.
[16:25.31]It's like gumballs too.
[16:26.31]Alright.
[16:26.57]So let me hold on.
[16:29.05]You think it's to try a new weapon?
[16:29.95]Do I have enough money?
[16:30.55]Let me try.
[16:30.87]Let me do another match.
[16:31.87]Let me just get a feel for the game.
[16:35.79]Just regular battle.
[16:36.41]Do story mode?
[16:38.31]I know.
[16:40.57]I will.
[16:40.85]I could all day.
[16:41.79]I said menu, then ammo shop.
[16:50.82]Alright.
[16:51.02]Well, hold on.
[16:53.18]Let me just play one more time.
[17:09.09]bot.
[17:10.97]Should I act like a bot?
[17:11.81]Just walk around like a World of Warcraft NPC?
[17:17.88]Alright, no, no, no, no, no.
[17:18.72]We're playing to win.
[17:33.79]What the hell was that?
[17:34.61]We just got hit by a hammer.
[17:39.45]X is the map.
[17:41.43]Oh shit, alright, cool.
[17:50.55]Going for the gank.
[17:57.51]Got it!
[17:57.65]Get that shit out of here.
[18:32.12]Shit!
[18:35.52]Right stick, right stick.
[18:36.58]What does the right stick do?
[18:40.44]Wait, wait, wait, we got, we got, we got... Right stick.
[18:46.07]Right stick is moving my camera, man.
[18:57.96]Sorry.
[18:59.72]R3.
[19:00.00]That's what I'm... It doesn't do anything!
[19:13.02]Oh, bullshit.
[19:13.84]Press right stick when you have a special.
[19:19.44]Top right is special?
[19:35.85]Alright, right stick, here we go, ready?
[19:53.04]What's that do?
[19:56.48]What does it do?
[20:00.10]Come on, we're doing alright.
[20:01.23]It's a shield.
[20:14.47]We had to have won that one, right?
[20:18.39]Yeah.
[20:21.71]26 point... 40 point... What does that mean?
[20:25.27]We lost by 1%.
[20:25.85]Alright, I want that roller.
[20:30.17]How do I get that?
[20:34.26]I want the huge roller.
[20:36.14]It's a shield, alright.
[20:41.43]Turn motion controls on.
[20:42.41]Um, I would, I will throw up into my shirt if I do that.
[20:52.27]See, let's get it.
[20:53.05]I did fine.
[20:57.46]Alright, so menu.
[21:01.32]Uh, weapons.
[21:03.76]I want the roller.
[21:16.55]Okay.
[21:21.16]Yep.
[21:25.94]I didn't read any of that.
[21:28.78]Alright, you get Sheldon License by battling and leveling up.
[21:33.44]Or even just developing your skills by, alright.
[21:40.77]So I want the roller.
[21:46.51]The splatter shot.
[21:47.43]This is actually locking up my head.
[21:49.53]Okay, so the Tri-Zuko.
[22:16.26]that's what I want I'm gonna destroy people with this thing bling ink or hold zr curling bombs alright
[22:35.50]No, don't buy that!
[22:37.18]I just want to skip the fucking lore.
[22:38.56]Alright, I want this.
[22:47.74]Um... This looks fun.
[22:51.58]You can test it out.
[22:59.65]I feel like I'm playing as a... I feel like I have a dragon greatsword in Dark Souls.
[23:06.47]Yeah, well, this thing's amazing.
[23:14.06]I feel like you can just get killed really easily here, though.
[23:16.60]Alright, what else does it do?
[23:19.42]Oh, you shoot it like a Roomba.
[23:22.08]Oh, alright, so that's... That's... Right bumper.
[23:29.33]What does left bumper do?
[23:30.17]Anything?
[23:30.41]No?
[23:30.47]No?
[23:35.31]I guess, holy shit, this is the strategy, isn't it?
[23:39.51]This is probably the strat.
[23:42.75]That's the strat.
[23:45.51]Whoa.
[23:57.47]It is a dragon grade sword.
[23:59.15]That's how you start every single fight.
[24:06.69]Alright, um... Jump Special?
[24:09.29]And what does this thing do?
[24:13.73]This is just a shield?
[24:14.37]Okay, let me try the other thing too.
[24:20.70]How do I get out of here?
[24:27.22]My game's... My game's bugged.
[24:29.42]My game's bugged.
[24:30.26]I can't leave.
[24:30.80]My game's bugged.
[24:31.36]Okay.
[24:34.30]Uh, let's try this.
[24:38.85]So how does this one work?
[24:42.81]Okay, this definitely needs motion controls.
[24:46.71]Otherwise you end up doing the thing where you play every console FPS where you go like this.
[24:50.77]The target's right there.
[24:51.90]I'd like to shoot that person.
[24:58.62]Not happening.
[24:59.04]It's a cool weapon though.
[25:06.78]I like the grenade better.
[25:13.14]Try out the gyro controls with it?
[25:14.24]Let me see.
[25:14.62]I don't think I can do it right now.
[25:19.89]Can I test anything else?
[25:22.57]Oh, I can.
[25:23.13]What's this thing?
[25:29.37]This thing kind of sucks.
[25:32.76]That range is awful.
[25:41.95]Is this supposed to be like a shotgun?
[25:43.67]Actually, never mind.
[25:44.37]This is cool.
[25:51.20]It's in the other settings.
[25:57.56]Oh, okay.
[25:59.82]Let me try this.
[26:07.65]Bro, no fucking way.
[26:08.91]How does anybody do this?
[26:13.70]I feel like when a 70 year old lady, a 70 year old woman was handed a Wiimote for the first time and she'd never play a game before in her entire life.
[26:24.02]That's how this feels to me.
[26:27.65]How do you turn?
[26:28.71]Oh, no, no, no.
[26:33.81]It's not.
[26:35.25]This is fine, right?
[26:36.69]Up and down vertical is fine, but it's the going side to side and having the right stick too.
[26:44.76]This is no way this is going to happen.
[26:52.06]Actually, hold on a minute.
[27:03.77]Actually.
[27:08.21]So should I be using the right stick at all?
[27:12.64]Press Y to reset.
[27:15.94]Oh.
[27:20.38]But, hold on.
[27:23.20]It's weird.
[27:27.11]Um, let me try the sniper with this.
[27:28.55]I mean, it's way better, but, like, it sucks at the same time.
[27:49.39]It's still weird though.
[27:51.51]It's the side to side motion that's still fucking me up.
[28:03.12]You're the worst sniper ever.
[28:05.54]Change the sensitivity on it.
[28:08.62]I just tried to do it with the OK sensitivity higher.
[28:27.56]I mean, it's better for aiming, but it still makes me want to puke.
[28:35.32]Lower is easier to get used to.
[28:39.22]I changed it.
[28:40.56]That's good.
[28:40.92]Look, sensitivity and motion.
[28:42.48]I did it.
[28:42.98]This was down here.
[28:44.48]I put it up.
[28:45.42]This is the controller sensitivity.
[28:46.68]I don't want that to be high.
[28:47.52]This is where I wanted it.
[28:50.28]I'll try it like this.
[28:51.12]Alright, I'm going to try the sniper.
[28:52.04]I'm going to try it with motion controls.
[28:56.16]No, I like it high.
[29:06.41]Are you on a handheld?
[29:07.25]No.
[29:08.48]But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[29:13.32]If I'm going to be Roller Andy, then why would I even care?
[29:22.54]Let me be, let me go back to, hold on.
[29:24.66]Because this isn't going to be, I don't like this.
[29:26.96]No, no way.
[29:30.56]Yeah.
[29:32.42]I'll try that later.
[29:37.93]This makes way more sense in my brain.
[29:39.53]Let me just get used to the game like this.
[29:40.97]Okay, leave.
[29:51.94]Okay.
[29:57.36]Alright, let me get it.
[29:59.66]So I got a roller.
[30:02.29]I'm ready.
[30:05.53]Roller main?
[30:06.25]Main?
[30:08.99]I mean, yeah.
[30:13.37]Maybe a little.
[30:16.55]Okay, so this is cool.
[30:20.36]Let's go to the lobby.
[30:26.94]Split Joy-Cons are actually better for this game.
[30:29.26]Really?
[30:38.38]What's this?
[30:43.35]Get advice?
[30:44.95]Is it a cat?
[31:04.13]Here we go.
[31:05.13]I'm going to top frag now.
[31:19.27]Motion controls are better.
[31:21.81]Yeah, maybe this is my third game ever on Splatoon.
[31:25.21]I've played as many games in Splatoon as there have been releases of this series.
[31:29.51]So let me get used to the game.
[31:30.73]Let's go.
[31:47.02]This is my job, right?
[32:01.95]Oh, yeah.
[32:02.47]We're going to do dual coats.
[32:03.96]That's right.
[32:32.76]What happened here?
[32:33.28]I gotta make sure we're covered.
[32:47.69]Every little percent counts.
[32:49.17]You've seen it every time we've played.
[32:50.71]Does that mean that somebody died there on my team?
[33:11.23]Sorry, I was tank.
[33:44.43]Come on!
[33:46.03]They wiped us out!
[33:52.92]I have a special, you're right.
[33:53.96]Fuck, I keep forgetting.
[33:58.09]How do I die there?
[33:59.51]What even just happened?
[34:28.05]Out of ink, what?
[34:28.77]That's gonna be the game changer right there.
[34:44.16]Never mind, we lost by a lot.
[34:49.02]Holy shit, we got destroyed.
[34:53.64]Learn how to spawn on your teammates.
[34:56.41]do you do that this was a 3v4 it was that's not fair press x when you respawn I like the the roller oh somebody DC'd alright that makes sense the arrow thing was a teammate jumping to you oh okay
[35:29.87]Rollers are fun.
[35:30.43]You know, I wrote this game off and thought it was dumb.
[35:42.39]That's my mistake.
[35:43.63]For, like, the last five years.
[35:45.35]Splatoon 1 came out.
[35:52.08]I was like, nah.
[35:53.02]Splatoon 2?
[35:53.82]Didn't even know it released.
[35:54.62]Splatoon 3?
[35:59.06]Where have I been all this time?
[36:01.04]What was I doing?
[36:02.08]Oh, it's because I was on the Wii U and that was an unbelievably awful experience.
[36:05.62]Now I remember.
[36:06.80]I wrote the whole series off because the Wii U existed.
[36:09.24]Alright, I'll get this.
[36:15.97]There we go.
[36:20.79]I helped.
[36:22.59]I'll get this corner.
[36:23.11]I'll get this corner.
[36:23.55]You get that one.
[36:31.49]Somebody ulting?
[36:32.01]You're going to be real disappointed when you realize that I was back here cleaning up your mess.
[36:42.19]That felt like an ad.
[36:43.45]That felt like I was on TV doing an ad.
[36:57.26]I got it.
[36:57.72]No, I didn't.
[37:03.85]and then right after.
[37:05.09]Splatoon 3, coming soon.
[37:33.76]Alright, how do I spawn on teammates?
[37:43.18]Is it X?
[37:47.17]Oh shit, okay.
[37:48.71]Like that?
[37:50.41]It worked!
[38:02.29]Why can't I jump up here?
[38:09.54]I just got a fucking pentakill, I think.
[38:42.11]Am I doing alright?
[38:46.75]Oh, wait, there's no way we're losing, right?
[38:55.56]Oh, I got a little bit.
[38:56.36]Mm-hmm.
[39:01.24]Alright, I got it.
[39:03.97]There it is.
[39:13.83]You can jump to anybody at any time?
[39:15.53]Really?
[39:15.81]That's cool.
[39:21.78]I can see your circle.
[39:23.12]What do you mean my circle?
[39:31.30]Let's get it.
[39:34.62]My eyes?
[39:35.04]Can you see my eyes?
[39:39.60]You can also jump back to spawn.
[39:44.63]Oh, yes.
[39:44.97]Alright.
[39:45.21]Wait, wait, wait.
[39:46.11]How does story mode work?
[39:47.55]How do I do this?
[39:50.39]Should I do one more?
[39:51.07]I have to piss so fucking bad.
[39:54.04]I'm sorry.
[39:54.42]It's been like 20 minutes.
[39:55.32]I'll be right back.
[39:56.12]Two seconds.
[41:21.31]We're good.
[41:23.45]Sorry.
[41:27.19]I've been just slamming fucking T's in water.
[41:31.29]Did you wash your hands?
[41:32.05]Of course I did.
[41:38.70]What do you mean?
[41:39.06]What happened to the BRB music?
[41:45.36]Yeah, I don't know why I got disconnected from my Scream Deck thing.
[41:47.94]Alright, I want to do one more.
[41:49.70]I'm going to do one more.
[41:54.01]And then I will do some other stuff.
[41:56.31]Let me do one more.
[41:59.44]I'm just barely getting the hang of the game.
[42:08.17]Talk to the cat.
[42:15.23]The fresh meter in the match menu measures your performance.
[42:19.19]When you win, the meter goes up, but if you lose a turf war battle, it drops.
[42:23.79]The meter also changes the color of the flag by each weapon.
[42:26.78]Use the fresh meter to see your personal records for each weapon.
[42:31.40]I mean, that's cool.
[42:39.52]Private battle?
[42:40.26]I don't think I can even do this yet.
[42:54.64]Turn on the gyro.
[42:56.80]No, not right now.
[42:58.28]I really don't like motion controls.
[43:03.79]So, when I press in the right stick, it makes a shield around me.
[43:11.39]It's a big shield for the team.
[43:12.53]Okay.
[43:58.43]Is there a double jump?
[44:10.27]What's up?
[44:18.05]Oh, fuck off.
[44:20.08]I thought it was gonna go further than that.
[44:22.54]What's this fucking weapon this person has?
[44:26.57]What was that?
[44:27.09]Blah, blah, blah.
[44:27.89]What was that thing?
[44:28.81]Why don't I have... What is this fucking hammer?
[44:52.69]Oh, we're in so much trouble here.
[45:07.44]What are these killstreaks, like Call of Duty killstreaks landing on us?
[45:44.04]Oh, my God.
[46:15.17]Where is this motherfucker?!
[46:16.17]Holy shit!
[46:26.58]Did you use your ult?
[46:29.73]We didn't even get to play the game!
[47:08.50]Can I move the alt indicator to, like, in the middle of the screen?
[47:15.42]I feel like I just don't know when it happens.
[47:16.94]I feel like, look, I have to look at where the facecam is.
[47:23.36]When it fills up, I want it to be like, Whoa!
[47:25.62]Your alt is ready!
[47:28.26]Can I mod the game to do that?
[47:38.12]Try a different weapon?
[47:38.88]I will.
[47:45.44]It already does do that?
[47:47.22]It does that?
[47:51.43]Your hair glows?
[47:52.57]Oh, shit.
[47:53.51]That's what that means.
[47:54.45]Alright, hold on.
[47:54.99]I thought I had a buff from a teammate.
[48:01.81]Alright, we're going to win this one.
[48:46.43]Alright, group up on me!
[48:48.57]Activate!
[49:26.92]shit alright well I'm glad that happened at the very beginning and not at the very end I started to understand the game so as a roller should I do what I'm doing is this am I helping is this what I should be doing don't go right to like the front lines just do some painting and shit right
[49:55.80]That's what I'm supposed to be doing, right?
[49:56.88]I mean, it makes sense that this is what I should be doing.
[50:05.23]Oh, this is my favorite song.
[50:08.31]Oh, you on the wall.
[50:09.05]You know the one.
[50:09.91]The lyrics go like this.
[50:12.35]Hold on.
[51:17.64]Are you dropping here?
[51:18.38]I know what that means now.
[52:10.43]Why am I gonna kill him in one hit?
[52:11.89]Why is he killing me in one hit?
[52:46.06]I'm gonna go back to the other weapon.
[53:00.24]I'm switching weapons.
[53:09.57]Did I actually scream in your ears?
[53:10.69]I'm sorry.
[53:23.55]Give me the default.
[53:28.41]I feel like I was doing better with this.
[53:29.49]Buy a new one?
[53:45.97]I need another, um...
[53:49.49]I want one of those ults that drops a fucking bunch of grenades on everybody.
[53:56.51]Play till level four.
[53:57.27]Okay, I'm ready.
[54:17.70]Every weapon has a different loadout.
[54:21.26]Hey, the roller was... You know what I mean?
[54:25.06]Uh-uh.
[54:26.27]Uh-uh.
[54:30.39]Let's go.
[54:30.79]Watch this.
[54:57.63]What the fuck was that?
[55:24.60]HAHAHAHA
[55:50.32]What's that?
[55:50.64]What's that?
[56:50.51]Ah!
[57:28.00]I looked over thinking I was gonna see, like, Omegalos, and it's just all MonkaF.
[57:35.09]Uh-oh.
[57:36.35]I was like, oh, they're probably gonna think that's funny.
[57:43.08]It's like, holy shit.
[57:44.24]Everyone's like, what the fuck was that?
[57:54.30]This is what Splatoon...
[58:07.14]Alright, hold on.
[58:08.14]One more!
[58:23.06]I had to go all in.
[58:25.26]I did it once, and I'm like, alright, that song has that happen twice.
[58:29.46]I gotta go all in.
[58:32.07]That was a Tasmanian Devil moment.
[58:33.45]I was like, I gotta go all in.
[58:42.92]What song?
[58:46.48]That's what I was doing.
[58:48.94]What are you talking about?
[58:58.69]That's not what it sounded like?
[59:03.18]It was... It didn't... Wait, you guys did not know that's what I was...
[59:09.70]What?! !
[59:18.50]That makes it even funnier for me.
[59:20.66]That makes it way better.
[59:21.70]I'm so happy.
[59:25.31]Double shield.
[59:43.36]What's that mean?
[59:43.90]What's this mean?
[59:44.46]What's that thing mean?
[60:08.58]It sounded like Woody Woodpecker.
[60:13.28]No way.
[60:13.89]No way.
[60:23.02]I should have.
[60:23.56]I'm an idiot.
[60:57.21]How do you think?
[61:06.86]Shit!
[61:45.01]Oh, come on man.
[62:03.43]We may have lost.
[62:08.83]Yeah, we lost.
[62:09.47]By a lot.
[62:16.35]Somebody called me an idiot for what?
[62:18.53]If you use your special, it refills your ink.
[62:21.43]Fucking idiot.
[62:25.99]I didn't know that.
[62:26.91]Man, I'm learning how to play the game.
[62:30.77]I want to hear the Woody Woodpecker.
[62:33.93]Can I hear it?
[62:34.27]Do we have a clip?
[62:40.14]Hold on.
[62:40.74]I need to hear it because I was doing the Splatoon theme song.
[62:44.76]Does anybody have a clip?
[62:59.84]How is that not the theme song?
[63:03.53]I'm trying to understand how you don't know that.
[63:12.79]That's the Splatoon theme song.
[63:14.77]I was so accurate.
[63:15.75]That was like perfect.
[63:19.16]People saying, oh, that wasn't even close.
[63:20.66]Yes, it was.
[63:23.18]God damn it.
[63:25.94]I have to play one with all the headphones in.
[63:33.33]Woody Woodpecker is a ha ha ha ha, a ha ha ha ha, a ha ha ha ha ha.
[63:39.79]That was ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha.
[63:43.65]You got it wrong.
[64:00.79]It's coming out.
[64:01.29]The volume is coming out of my speakers here.
[64:03.45]Alright, this is the one.
[64:06.31]And then I promise after this, I will stop and I will do story mode for at least 10 minutes.
[64:40.09]Good.
[64:40.35]Control the middle.
[64:40.87]Control mid.
[64:44.79]I'll make him way up.
[65:09.32]That was a pretty good life.
[65:23.15]It was alright.
[65:32.27]Oh my God, that was a fucking explosive.
[65:56.82]Alright, we're actually starting to lose pretty bad now.
[66:18.29]Shit!
[66:20.69]Oh my god, my ultimate!
[66:22.21]I had it right at the end.
[66:45.01]It's alright, I got the ult off.
[66:54.55]Just go, go, go, go, we only have 20 seconds.
[66:55.89]It's alright, it's alright.
[67:15.56]I mean, we got dominated, but that's fine.
[67:22.92]Oh my goodness, we didn't even play.
[67:45.56]You're actually so bad.
[67:54.14]Okay.
[67:55.18]I'm going to go to the store.
[67:58.54]I was number one on the team by almost twice.
[68:07.23]There are a few shops around here with gear.
[68:08.89]Okay.
[68:14.70]I have a store now.
[68:18.37]So what about headgear?
[68:19.63]I got 10 grand.
[68:33.97]We sell stuff that you wear on your head, you know, like hats.
[68:38.67]They've got gear abilities.
[68:41.57]Okay.
[68:46.70]quick super jump run speed up come back what's that boost some of your abilities for a short time after respawning quick respawn alright well this is what I didn't have any of these
[69:14.44]Reduce damage taken and improves mobility when walking through enemy ink.
[69:17.60]That's actually pretty good.
[69:18.42]Is this the only clothing... Is this the only pieces of headgear you have?
[69:25.08]Alright, I'm buying it.
[69:31.98]So I'm going to put the umpire mask on.
[69:36.23]Um... Okay, I can unlock some stuff.
[69:42.81]The slosher.
[69:45.62]Oh, this is the pail of ink.
[69:47.46]Okay.
[69:51.13]Okay.
[69:54.91]Okay.
[69:58.13]Okay.
[70:11.62]Dual welding pistol type weapons that, let's be honest, look pretty sweet.
[70:14.38]Alright, that actually looks really cool.
[70:15.76]I want it.
[70:16.08]I have, is this a dodge roll?
[70:25.77]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[70:27.01]This is too much info.
[70:29.57]Too much info, too much info.
[70:30.73]I'll just go play with it in the, uh, in the, like, the Splatoon room.
[70:35.04]Sprinkler, okay, cool.
[70:37.88]Yep, alright.
[70:42.33]Okay.
[70:42.85]Alright, I'm just gonna- I'm gonna go play- Did any- Did one person actually sit there and listen to that whole thing?
[71:00.20]Alright, I'm gonna try the slosher.
[71:06.01]So how does this work?
[71:15.29]Yeah, this thing's crazy.
[71:23.24]This thing can have... Alright, so I gotta explain this to me.
[71:28.88]Why would you use the roller brush?
[71:31.74]This thing has more surface area.
[71:33.97]Just go like this.
[71:34.53]Actually, maybe not.
[71:46.98]Twister time?
[71:52.70]That's amazing.
[71:54.92]Different rolls for different weapons.
[71:56.77]Okay.
[72:01.37]I kind of like it.
[72:02.01]There's three twisters.
[72:08.28]Really?
[72:08.60]Okay.
[72:20.66]It's time to get used to the motion controls.
[72:27.19]Let's see.
[72:47.24]Yeah, I don't like it, but it's just way more effective.
[72:50.26]I'll actually be actually hitting things.
[72:54.53]Alright, I want to try the other thing.
[72:58.17]I got dual pistols, right?
[72:59.29]It's kind of like the default weapon, but better.
[73:18.30]Sticky?
[73:18.66]Oh, it's like a sticky bomb?
[73:24.82]They're good.
[73:36.42]B is dodge roll.
[73:42.61]B is jump.
[73:47.73]How do I do it?
[73:48.47]V while shooting.
[73:49.19]I mean, this is incredible.
[73:58.51]Alright.
[73:58.75]I'm thinking that's probably the best one I like so far.
[74:02.45]What about this?
[74:04.93]Big staff.
[74:12.04]This runs out of ink really fast.
[74:23.53]This is all about burst.
[74:24.63]You got a group up here.
[74:25.89]If there's a group, let's say there's two or three people, you just go... That's what kept killing me before.
[74:35.06]Whoa.
[74:39.16]Yeah, somebody would just walk up and go.
[74:41.44]And three of us would die.
[74:42.10]Alright, what's the... Okay.
[74:49.65]Okay.
[74:54.09]I have to sit back for this.
[74:55.07]For this to make any sense.
[74:56.87]Okay.
[75:08.54]I have to have... This has not been plugged in for about 20 straight minutes.
[75:17.58]It... Hold on.
[75:48.88]We didn't hear?
[75:49.48]You guys did not hear that.
[75:54.66]Too close.
[75:55.46]I don't get it.
[75:58.26]We heard the end a little bit.
[75:59.68]Oh, I was doing that.
[76:00.78]Yeah, this is plugged in now.
[76:10.84]Um, alright, I'm ready.
[76:12.12]I'm ready to do a few more.
[76:12.97]I feel like the crossbow's gonna be fun.
[76:32.76]Oh my goodness, that goes far.
[76:42.64]The trajectory on these bullets are weird.
[76:44.70]Okay.
[76:54.03]Clean the room?
[76:55.67]Clean your room.
[76:56.19]What do you fire?
[77:19.32]I definitely want this eventually.
[77:20.56]Oh, a sprinkler.
[77:30.37]I like that.
[77:30.83]Cool.
[77:38.35]Alright, so what am I going to buy?
[77:39.21]What am I buying?
[77:44.13]Do the ult?
[77:46.15]Make waves.
[77:53.41]That's what this thing was.
[77:58.53]This game's cool.
[77:59.39]I like it.
[78:00.75]Alright, what am I doing?
[78:04.63]Should I use the heavy thing?
[78:09.62]Paintbrush seems really good.
[78:13.32]I'll do splat dualies, I think.
[78:20.64]Dodge roll seems too good.
[78:25.17]Now, what about other gear?
[78:29.23]You can buy two things.
[78:29.99]I don't know what I want, though.
[78:30.87]I don't want to spend.
[78:35.07]I don't know what I want yet.
[78:35.73]Alright, what do you got?
[78:47.08]Respawn Punisher.
[78:47.98]Okay, that's actually pretty good.
[78:55.85]Super jump speed?
[78:56.62]How do you do a super jump?
[79:03.60]That seems good too.
[79:22.25]Cool.
[79:23.81]Should I buy this other stuff?
[79:25.85]Somebody said this resets daily.
[79:31.89]Will I lose out on this?
[79:37.45]Don't worry about it.
[79:41.85]Resets in 30 minutes.
[79:43.35]Should I buy anything?
[79:45.13]It'll come back eventually.
[79:46.01]Okay, well, whatever.
[79:48.27]So that's my shirt.
[79:49.75]Is there pants or anything?
[79:57.30]Okay, weapons, clothing, shoes.
[80:04.90]Okay.
[80:10.92]Special power up.
[80:18.18]Hides your super jump landing point.
[80:20.66]That seems good.
[80:24.05]That seems good.
[80:26.87]Damage taken.
[80:29.74]That seems good.
[80:36.16]I think it's this one.
[80:39.73]Stealth jump is S tier.
[80:40.89]I feel like it's this one, yeah.
[80:50.81]Anything else I can buy before I get back in?
[80:56.89]General?
[81:02.82]You're tacky.
[81:08.04]General?
[81:15.05]Hey, welcome to Atlantis.
[81:17.17]I don't really work here, but you can shop around and I'll sell you stuff.
[81:20.85]Put it in your locker, I guess?
[81:21.93]It's all pretty random.
[81:23.93]Oh, your locker's in the locker room.
[81:25.57]Duh, you can go look at it later.
[81:27.33]Anything in there, I guess it's yours by default.
[81:29.02]Okay.
[81:33.24]What are these, like, stickers?
[81:40.54]Alright.
[81:43.95]Oh, you can customize your banner.
[81:45.49]Alright, sure.
[81:55.07]So I get a sports comic.
[82:09.24]What did I buy?
[82:15.20]What do I do with this?
[82:32.66]That's kind of a cool mechanic.
[82:34.70]Customize your locker.
[82:35.78]Alright, let's go to the locker.
[82:52.09]Is it in the lobby?
[83:03.58]Cool.
[83:14.06]Okay, um... Edit splash tag?
[83:22.69]It's to your right.
[83:25.97]Oh, there it is.
[83:26.47]Okay.
[83:35.58]Cool, okay.
[83:37.54]That one's yours.
[83:43.50]These are other players' lockers?
[83:44.72]Okay.
[83:55.73]I don't... What do I do?
[84:01.35]What should I do?
[84:01.75]Does that mean this... Edit?
[84:17.99]OK, well, where is it?
[84:44.04]Okay.
[85:24.98]locker oh whoa cool look at all this cool stuff a shovel oh man just hanging up my hats chairs oh now this is a cool music one you have no idea what's in those boxes
[85:56.97]I want to play a game.
[85:57.91]I'm playing now.
[85:58.68]Time to play.
[86:03.08]I'm going to try my new loadout.
[86:06.10]Regular battle.
[86:14.98]I'm going to try with the motion.
[86:16.00]I'm going to be really pissed off, so just wait.
[86:20.04]Just wait for me to complain about the motion controls.
[86:21.63]It's going to happen.
[86:29.36]How should I be sitting?
[86:30.16]Alright.
[86:32.41]So should I calibrate it with the controller kind of facing up?
[86:37.35]Where should my resting point be?
[86:38.47]What do you think?
[86:41.28]Should it be facing kind of down and then up so I face down?
[86:44.46]Where do you think it should be?
[86:45.20]Where should I rest it?
[86:50.90]Let it rest on your lap.
[86:52.27]Alright.
[86:58.51]You look goofy.
[87:13.19]Go.
[87:42.90]It's fucking weird to get... I can't get used to this.
[87:46.04]In a game scenario, it's like... No, I... I feel like...
[88:25.75]No, I have to go back.
[88:28.82]I can't like... No, no, it's gonna make me puke.
[88:33.44]I can't do it.
[88:51.06]God!
[89:02.17]I can't use it.
[89:03.66]I can't do it.
[89:04.26]I gotta go back.
[89:11.88]No, no fucking way.
[89:12.91]Not a chance in hell.
[89:14.61]Not a chance in hell.
[89:17.97]Guys, I don't think I've done one damage to a single other person.
[89:30.75]Let me drive my car over there!
[89:32.14]Alright, don't get mad.
[90:16.85]Alright, this is actually not that bad.
[90:18.84]This is actually not that bad.
[90:34.27]Motion controls suck.
[90:38.83]Somebody wrote that in all caps.
[90:50.31]Let me try it without the motion controls again.
[91:06.84]You know what my problem is?
[91:08.50]It's not just the fact that it's motion controls, right?
[91:12.20]It's the fact that I still have to press B to jump and left trigger and rotate with the right stick.
[91:20.66]It's just, it's not all motion controls, right?
[91:23.92]For me, it's got to go all in and nothing at all, right?
[91:25.89]I got to go all in with motion controls or not at all.
[91:29.11]Like I need to make sure that I don't press any buttons besides maybe one.
[91:42.12]Okay, in my mind, motion controls are right.
[91:43.96]I got the sword and shield in both hands.
[91:47.30]And there's one or two buttons here that I can press.
[91:51.35]Needing to move... I don't know.
[91:52.89]I can't do the move left and right with stick and motion controls.
[92:07.22]That's VR.
[92:09.53]Did you see how fucking weird VR is?
[92:13.78]VR is not a good example.
[92:17.18]How many times have you walked into your wall playing VR?
[92:21.30]How many times have you gone like this?
[92:22.52]Take the headset off and go like... And then put... No, it doesn't work that way.
[92:32.65]Less than you.
[92:42.79]Story mode?
[92:43.37]I will.
[92:43.77]I just like playing this game.
[92:45.47]Okay.
[92:55.90]You're going to love the salmon run.
[93:03.56]I promise I'll try it.
[93:12.09]Alright, let's pull it together here.
[93:29.25]Get off!
[93:33.15]What did I just do?
[93:41.99]I just went back to the fountain.
[93:43.09]I forgot to buy boots.
[93:59.16]Let's go!
[94:13.13]How do I move?
[94:18.57]I don't even, I don't know how the thing even works.
[94:39.08]Invader?
[94:42.05]And there was an invader, alright.
[95:08.42]Oh, you're too fast!
[95:21.32]No motion controls, Andy.
[95:26.61]We're gonna win.
[95:27.27]We're doing fine.
[95:31.07]Fuck.
[96:23.74]You stink wicked badly.
[96:24.60]I can see the green stink lines.
[96:42.09]I should be able to check a box that is Q me only with people that are not using motion controls.
[96:48.82]All the motion control Mortys can play with each other.
[96:51.30]That's fine.
[97:09.77]Alright, this is actually, I promise, this is the last one.
[97:11.84]Then I'm going to do story mode.
[97:30.17]Um, maybe I should, hold on.
[97:32.47]Nah, it's too late.
[97:46.59]I was a sniper on the enemy team.
[97:47.86]This is bad.
[98:19.37]I don't even know where the person came from.
[98:49.89]Does that go through walls?
[98:50.75]Fucking keyboard World of Warcraft turning.
[99:24.72]Wait, is that an enemy?
[99:25.70]No, the yellow freaked me out.
[99:43.59]What the hell?
[99:44.33]What does that thing do?
[100:19.07]Don't let them get away with that.
[100:47.44]I think we win!
[100:49.42]We got a lot of, uh... I think we're good.
[100:57.74]Oh yeah, we're good.
[101:12.99]They had a disconnect?
[101:13.85]LOL.
[101:18.58]Try competitive?
[101:19.67]I'm not going to try... Why would I do that?
[101:23.81]I just learned... I just learned how to play the game.
[101:26.90]I'm going to... You ranked.
[101:27.88]No way.
[101:28.06]What?
[101:28.26]Alright, one more.
[101:57.78]Yeah, well, I learned the controls.
[101:59.68]Time to queue up against people that probably have been playing the game for like 500 hours.
[102:03.19]Alright, this is the one.
[102:35.53]Oh, I was going to dodge it.
[102:36.47]Shit.
[102:44.13]How come?
[102:44.41]Wait, where's our rollers?
[103:21.34]Alright, covered a lot of ground.
[103:59.71]What the fuck?
[104:07.30]Whoa!
[104:13.59]Ah, shit.
[104:14.49]Sorry.
[105:04.96]Come on, I was sitting there waiting for you!
[105:06.65]That was a good one.
[105:22.72]How come nobody told me this game was this fun?
[105:38.58]we did I mean some people did and the recommended channel was like hey dude you should really try Splatoon 3 or any Splatoon it would be alright and there weren't that many like thumbs up on it maybe like 15 to 25 000 so I mean I mean a lot of people thought it was maybe some people did
[106:07.34]Oh, listen up.
[106:08.19]It's going down.
[106:10.69]Repping Anarchy Splatcast.
[106:12.59]We're live.
[106:17.77]Let's see the current battle stages.
[106:19.04]Oh, are they changing stages?
[106:41.00]Go outside.
[106:41.72]Why do I feel like this is a surprise birthday party waiting for me out here?
[106:51.53]Oh.
[106:56.19]Alright, what do you want me to do out here?
[107:11.18]Go to the grate.
[107:21.09]The frame rate is so weird out here.
[107:22.35]I feel like I have 3D glasses on without a 3D movie.
[107:26.07]Kind of hurts.
[107:26.89]Alright.
[107:27.21]What do you want me to do?
[107:43.68]ZL.
[107:49.07]I just pressed it.
[107:51.43]ZL.
[107:53.75]ZL.
[107:54.27]I'm pressing it.
[107:58.67]Oh my god.
[107:59.39]I just have... ZL.
[108:05.08]What is the...
[108:10.65]Why can't we just call buttons the same?
[108:13.27]They're all the same fucking controller.
[108:14.73]They have the same amount of buttons, and they're in the exact same place.
[108:17.93]Why do we have to call them different things?
[108:21.70]Z, L, Z, R, L...
[108:36.86]L is for left.
[108:37.60]I know, but what is Z?
[108:39.14]I know Z is supposed to be the old N64 controller.
[108:46.99]Left bumper?
[108:48.25]Left trigger.
[108:51.45]L1.
[108:53.05]L2.
[108:56.31]ZL.
[108:56.87]No, you don't flip it.
[108:58.09]ZL.
[108:59.49]It should be LZ.
[109:16.79]So why did I come down here?
[109:18.89]The raid Zapfish has gone missing.
[109:20.11]Okay.
[109:20.39]Okay.
[109:24.53]Go get the Zapfish.
[109:47.47]The pay is zero.
[109:51.82]Okay.
[110:03.28]Okay.
[110:05.33]Okay.
[110:08.91]Watch out.
[110:09.23]Watch out.
[110:09.61]That thing does curse damage.
[110:10.59]Watch out.
[110:10.89]That does curse damage.
[110:11.59]You'll instantly get killed.
[110:23.95]Octo-charks.
[110:24.49]Alright, so cool.
[110:28.99]Let's look our way into the Octarian base.
[110:32.09]Keep your ears open for my nuggets of wisdom.
[110:42.09]This way.
[110:42.53]Alright, let's go.
[110:58.31]Okay, don't touch the fuzzy ooze.
[111:01.19]Alright, that's cool.
[111:10.71]Let's go play the game.
[111:12.41]How do I get out of here?
[111:15.36]Table top mode?
[111:25.32]Pop that, the whole thing would boof, disappear.
[111:29.54]That didn't do anything?
[111:50.26]Do we have anything with more oomph?
[111:53.44]Oh.
[112:13.60]Play the first level or?
[112:21.10]Okay, let's go.
[112:57.50]Sick.
[112:59.80]This is pretty good burp core.
[113:05.26]Burp core.
[113:29.16]This is actually, this is pretty good Rugrats core, you're right.
[113:49.15]That's a cool move.
[113:52.35]Splat switch.
[114:01.92]Does this tell me how to aim at the center of my screen?
[114:13.86]Is the crate where?
[114:14.58]Far away crate.
[114:34.47]Nice job.
[114:37.33]I got a toaster.
[115:09.03]Oh, come on.
[115:09.43]How do I get up there?
[115:50.03]Uh-oh, watch out!
[115:50.84]An Octotrooper!
[116:21.62]This is LittleBigPlanet 2 custom game.
[116:35.16]God, that's actually true.
[116:37.79]This is really what it feels like.
[116:40.91]That's a Zapfish!
[116:45.51]How do I get it?
[116:49.55]Bring it home?
[116:55.33]How do I pick it up?
[116:56.35]Oh.
[117:03.34]It's going to be stuck in my head all day.
[117:10.20]That's fun.
[117:11.88]That's cool that you can do that.
[117:18.50]Single player is pretty cool.
[117:19.30]Let's go back to be a... Let's do some multiplayer.
[117:35.59]That was cool.
[117:39.93]How do I get out of here?
[117:56.07]How do I get out of here?
[118:04.39]Menu, then... Yeah, I have to go to... Oh, I have to go to the right.
[118:08.14]Okay.
[118:08.30]Alright, there we go.
[118:15.50]Do salmon run?
[118:16.32]Let me do some more multiplayer.
[118:17.28]That's my favorite.
[118:26.12]I'll do salmon run in another 30 minutes.
[118:27.97]Alright.
[118:35.45]In 30 minutes, I will do salmon run.
[118:36.75]I promise.
[118:37.07]I feel like I'm just starting to get good.
[119:00.39]But on a 30 minute timer?
[119:02.19]Yeah, mods, you can do it.
[119:11.23]You need motion controls to improve?
[119:16.54]I think I'm doing okay.
[119:22.42]Salmon Run is co-op.
[119:24.56]Well, let's do it.
[119:26.30]Queue up for it.
[119:29.77]Well, not right now, but you know, later.
[119:45.54]I like these a lot.
[119:53.15]You're going to do Zelda?
[119:58.33]Yep.
[120:00.05]After I'm done playing Splatoon 3, I will get booted from the servers.
[120:05.65]Apparently.
[120:11.54]I might have to restart the game.
[120:18.92]We'll find out.
[120:21.14]I like the actual just play the game against players is probably my favorite part.
[120:26.65]I don't think this is going to work.
[120:33.10]Only salmon run servers are up right now.
[120:39.58]No, you're a liar.
[120:40.34]Alright, let's go for it.
[120:51.53]You got banned for being over 16.
[121:05.28]This is a new map.
[121:12.01]Ooh, caught a few off guard!
[121:16.21]I ran into a fucking pole.
[121:39.97]Get that shit outta here.
[122:18.07]I don't know this map.
[123:13.35]I don't even know what just happened.
[123:14.57]I can't even see.
[123:18.13]I thought I killed that person.
[123:19.26]Apparently they went under.
[123:20.18]I don't know.
[123:24.70]What is going on, man?
[123:25.70]Alright, we gotta pull this back right now.
[123:51.43]Wipe the whole team!
[123:52.05]Alright, come on, come on, come on!
[123:52.78]Spread it, spread it, spread it!
[123:53.58]Ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink,

[124:27.38]Salmon run.
[124:27.82]Servers are up.
[124:28.90]Oh, are they really?
[124:33.80]Level five.
[124:43.05]Stop bullying.
[124:53.17]This new clothes.
[124:54.27]I'll check.
[124:54.59]How did I got last place?
[124:56.05]I didn't get last place.
[124:59.23]Let's be honest.
[125:01.36]We're all within 100 points of each other.
[125:04.16]We all contributed very well.
[125:11.90]Your catalog leveled up.
[125:13.76]I'll check it after this.
[125:14.40]Okay.
[125:26.93]You're getting carried by viewers?
[125:40.20]That's alright.
[125:51.19]What does this do?
[126:36.68]I- You know what?
[126:37.28]I just still don't- Yeah, I- I don't understand how to use that fucking thing.
[127:42.75]I'm just not gonna use that fucking ult.
[127:44.68]It fucks me up.
[128:41.35]I don't know why am I even getting into the mechanical object?
[128:44.81]I think we're okay.
[128:59.12]Nice nerd voice.
[129:03.75]That was kind of a George.
[129:24.16]Alright, let me go check out the gear.
[129:28.30]I was... Come on, look what I did.
[129:29.50]I may have done a couple of... I screwed up a little.
[129:35.10]I think we did alright.
[129:35.88]Alright, let me go to the shop.
[129:43.05]Some new stuff, right?
[129:52.73]Jerry...
[129:55.00]Ooh, your catalog level went up.
[130:00.44]Cool.
[130:03.42]Growing rookie.
[130:04.91]Sure.
[130:07.11]Okay.
[130:11.31]Detergent.
[130:16.94]Expensive.
[130:24.42]That's not funny to waste all my money.
[130:41.51]Cool.
[130:44.51]Oh, wow, there is new stuff.
[130:45.41]Alright, what does this do?
[130:53.26]Special weapon.
[130:55.54]increases damage dealt to all non-player targets.
[131:03.69]Squid rolls and squid surge is easier to do.
[131:11.01]I feel like that's pretty good.
[131:17.92]Ink tank refill rate?
[131:21.44]That seems really good.
[131:22.62]Okay.
[131:27.98]What have we got?
[131:29.16]Special saver.
[131:29.90]Is it the same thing?
[131:50.32]That's good.
[131:52.82]That's good too.
[131:53.56]Should I do double ink tank?
[132:02.22]That seems kind of good.
[132:03.90]There's diminishing returns.
[132:05.70]Okay.
[132:10.14]Maybe I should just keep the thing I have on.
[132:22.34]Movement speed?
[132:23.66]Oh, I think I want that.
[132:24.74]Cool.
[132:30.74]I feel like I'm too slow.
[132:32.74]Buy that yellow shirt.
[132:41.01]Alright, let's go.
[132:51.27]You look really scrunchily.
[132:53.33]What's that mean?
[132:59.73]Is that a sword?
[133:01.13]Hold on.
[133:03.01]What is that?
[133:03.87]Umbrella?
[133:04.39]We're going to test some shit out.
[133:07.39]Whoa.
[133:17.94]Is this defense?
[133:27.28]I like this.
[133:32.34]Everyone stands behind you.
[133:37.68]Or you could just like... Okay.
[133:44.66]Sprinkler.
[133:48.75]Can you only have one of those active at a time?
[133:50.53]Yeah.
[133:58.45]Um...
[134:00.65]Oh, you lose it.
[134:01.41]I'm assuming it has a respawn.
[134:03.23]Alright, that's cool.
[134:07.21]What about the special?
[134:14.74]What's the special?
[134:17.18]Twister time.
[134:33.38]I like it.
[134:34.06]Maybe I'll try it.
[134:39.54]That's what that is.
[134:40.22]What about, what do we got?
[134:43.02]Umbrella?
[134:43.62]This new sword.
[134:44.34]That's a windshield wiper.
[134:46.90]Alright.
[134:56.03]This thing seems amazing.
[134:56.91]Am I invisible?
[135:08.80]Am I invisible when I do this?
[135:10.08]Is that stealth or something?
[135:18.33]Oh, it's just the camera.
[135:19.11]Okay.
[135:19.31]Is that a homing missile?
[135:27.19]Alright, I'm definitely going to try this.
[135:28.29]I mean, you can just like whack, whack, whack, whack, charge it up and bang.
[135:37.54]This seems amazing.
[135:39.67]Okay, what about the... This is what everybody was doing.
[135:43.34]Okay.
[135:48.30]This is broken.
[135:58.05]Okay.
[135:59.27]Very cool.
[136:00.03]Alright, so what else?
[136:00.75]Okay.
[136:10.26]Is that a Nintendo blaster?
[136:12.28]Cool.
[136:26.94]Cool.
[136:32.52]I imagine this is just a lot, very high damage, short range.
[136:46.81]Great ink coverage.
[136:50.63]Really, it does, doesn't it?
[136:51.72]Alright, what's the special?
[136:55.54]Cantuna?
[137:00.42]Healing station, I imagine.
[137:09.30]Or is it an ink station?
[137:18.87]It's a speed buff?
[137:21.53]Cool.
[137:22.21]Alright.
[137:25.43]What's the difference between this one and this one?
[137:29.52]There are so many weapons in this game.
[137:37.06]Is this one faster?
[137:42.36]Carbon roller is faster but weaker.
[137:43.74]Actually, I would like this way more.
[137:50.44]I can actually get some coverage.
[138:05.58]Splatoon 2 had over 300 weapons?
[138:06.80]What?
[138:13.06]In my brain, it was just this thing.
[138:15.78]The regular gun and the sniper rifle.
[138:18.89]I didn't think it was this detailed.
[138:19.91]I really didn't.
[138:20.35]Alright, what's the special look like?
[138:31.49]Find out.
[138:41.28]What the hell?
[138:49.00]That's weird.
[138:49.46]Alright.
[138:52.45]Well, I'm going to do... I'm going to do a sword and umbrella.
[138:58.37]Is that a flamethrower?
[138:59.09]I'm going to clean up.
[139:14.65]What is this?
[139:18.24]oh I get it so you can be like alright throw that and you know what I mean like this pop oh that's really cool I like that
[139:53.78]I like it.
[139:54.12]Wait.
[140:00.19]Jesus.
[140:03.31]I still think I'm going with the... Yeah.
[140:09.53]I'm going with the sword.
[140:21.53]Sword and... I'll try.
[140:24.15]I'll get this thing.
[140:24.69]I'll try this thing.
[140:25.17]Are you going to be mad if I have to pee again?
[140:32.04]I'm right back.
[142:42.75]Okie dokie.
[142:56.25]His aim is awful.
[142:57.01]I don't think I can't see what you're riding.
[143:03.97]Don't act like I can't see what you just rode.
[143:09.04]Okay, so I got my new weapon.
[143:10.26]I'm ready to go.
[143:13.12]We heard you dodge roll while you peed.
[143:15.28]Can you imagine that?
[143:21.73]It's just a stream of piss.
[143:24.85]And then like... I don't think you would... Well, you wouldn't think I dodge rolled.
[143:28.81]You'd think I like fell down.
[143:35.03]You just hear the fat rolling sound with a bunch of gear on.
[143:37.47]Alright, let's play.
[143:52.68]I want to see the funny platoon messages.
[143:56.40]Well, you're going to have to wait until you play.
[144:04.80]Turn on post.
[144:06.42]I'm not doing it.
[144:09.28]I'm not doing it.
[144:23.04]The plaza is full of drawings.
[144:25.04]Alright.
[144:27.76]Can you confirm or deny that the... What if I... Maybe I'll check it out.
[144:35.05]Maybe.
[144:35.85]If you're good.
[144:36.31]On your birthday.
[144:39.95]Alright.
[144:40.27]Let's go.
[144:40.61]Check it out.
[144:56.83]I didn't... I got so mad right there.
[145:27.96]We got it, we got it, we got it, we got it, we got it.
[145:42.05]Sorry, I thought you were an enemy.
[146:07.79]Get that shit away from me!
[146:08.77]What was that little dog?
[146:09.81]What was that little dog?
[146:46.19]Let's go!
[147:36.21]Alright, man, I was going nuts there.
[147:45.23]I'm impressed you didn't fall into the water.
[148:06.23]Can you actually, does it kill you?
[148:11.11]I'll try salmon run on your birthday.
[148:19.21]I didn't.
[148:19.91]Let's get off that screen because I didn't really do that.
[148:21.39]I did a lot of kill stealing, I think.
[148:22.67]No, I didn't.
[148:24.91]I got a lot of secured kills.
[148:26.07]You saw it.
[148:27.87]It was like pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
[148:31.54]I did pretty good.
[148:48.12]It's my birthday today.
[148:53.97]Well, happy birthday.
[148:55.22]We'll play Sam and Ron.
[149:43.13]I miss... I was doing pretty good too.
[149:46.67]That's unfortunate.
[150:02.88]It's the same spot!
[150:05.78]In the same spot, dude?
[150:08.08]Are you kidding me?
[150:08.78]I died in the same place.
[150:10.99]Pixel perfect.
[150:42.61]Oh, we got them all.
[150:43.03]Let's go!
[151:06.04]One minute left.
[151:06.80]Alright, we can pull this together right now.
[151:44.43]There's somebody behind me.
[151:45.47]I'm going to uninstall it.
[152:05.27]Alright, we're doing good.
[152:10.78]I think we actually pulled it back.
[152:12.81]Look at that.
[152:13.33]Look what we did at that last 10 seconds.
[152:14.93]We had to have gotten it.
[152:16.71]Yep.
[152:21.10]Throw your switch in the trash.
[152:33.18]That's so funny because the Switch is the only console that is big enough to throw away in the trash like it's a crumpled up piece of paper.
[152:43.94]You can actually just drop it into the trash.
[152:46.56]You can't do that with a PS5 or an Xbox.
[152:50.80]It's too big.
[153:02.78]Alright, this is the last one.
[153:03.76]I still want to play Breath of the Wild, too.
[153:10.24]I like this weapon.
[153:18.55]It doesn't do very much damage, but it secures kills.
[153:22.61]I don't do a whole lot of painting, but I've secured a lot of kills.
[153:25.78]You know it.
[153:27.26]Don't tell me I haven't.
[153:27.98]You know it.
[153:28.36]You've seen it.
[153:49.91]Oh, come on.
[154:00.02]Let me try that.
[154:00.66]Might as well put the other weapon on then, right?
[154:02.08]This is the new one I got?
[154:18.20]Oh, this is when you shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, throw.
[154:24.62]This got a lot of spread on it.
[154:26.28]This is actually pretty damn good.
[154:27.52]Alright, so how does this one work?
[154:31.64]Yeah, alright.
[154:32.14]We'll try this.
[154:35.71]Please beatbox the Splatoon 3 theme.
[154:40.11]I... I don't... I don't think I can do it.
[155:05.03]Am I actually going to get to play or what?
[155:12.05]I don't like the water levels.
[155:12.93]You die instantly.
[155:14.07]Was this GTA 3?
[155:54.62]I didn't get anybody?
[155:55.96]How did that not get one person?
[155:57.16]That's impossible.
[155:58.64]That's impossible.
[155:59.82]What?
[156:00.52]I didn't get one person.
[156:01.42]I hit everybody.
[156:18.85]You got a person?
[156:19.38]Okay.
[156:22.68]This game is fun.
[156:23.56]Damn.
[156:42.74]That was like three ults at the same time.
[157:09.38]That bubble launcher, I want that.
[157:45.78]I think we lost.
[157:46.38]Oh my god, that's a wipeout.
[157:53.06]Hoover did that.
[157:53.54]You're an absolute pro.
[158:24.59]Got that coverage.
[158:25.19]I was only looking for coverage.
[158:26.55]I wasn't looking for kills.
[158:29.13]I was looking for coverage, not kills, and we got it.
[158:30.81]It's been 30 minutes?
[158:52.86]Alright, I'm going to play one more.
[158:56.29]And then that's it, and I'll do Salmon Run.
[159:07.94]If this is not the last one before Salmon Run, I will take a bite out of my Switch.
[159:34.81]Okay, but I don't have to play that for a while.
[159:37.95]I can come right back to this, but I will try Salmon Run.
[159:41.75]After this.
[159:42.13]We need more coverage, guys.
[160:03.69]What's going on here?
[160:06.25]Guys, where's the coverage?
[160:08.93]Do I have to take care of everything here?
[160:54.64]There we go, good coverage, good coverage.
[161:45.71]How do you jump?
[162:33.90]Just zone, zone, zone, zone him, zone him, zone him.
[162:54.35]That's going to be one of the best of the night.
[163:19.61]You just made my seven-year-old nephew cry, dude.
[163:21.65]What the fuck?
[163:28.59]I want it.
[163:28.85]Can I see the, um... Let's get a screenshot of that one.
[163:35.07]Just saying.
[163:40.03]Alright, where's the salmon run thing?
[163:51.69]Same place, right?
[164:00.34]Where do I do it?
[164:00.86]Okay, I guess I'll just do this one, right?
[164:11.38]Whatever this is.
[164:12.83]Gone fishing hydro plant.
[164:23.78]Map?
[164:27.48]Wait, what do you want me to do?
[164:29.54]Rizco?

[165:30.60]Listen up.
[165:32.62]Salmonids will approach from the water.
[165:35.96]Get rid of them.
[165:39.52]They drop power eggs.
[165:42.22]Okay.
[165:45.84]Easy enough.
[165:48.30]Why are the graphics better here?
[166:01.29]More power eggs.
[166:28.71]Sounds good.
[166:30.95]Harvest golden eggs.
[166:32.14]Only boss salmonids have those.
[166:35.92]Boss salmonid alert.
[166:37.34]I like the colors though.
[166:45.65]Alright, there's a boss salmonid somewhere.
[167:01.20]Do I have to walk into these?
[167:03.98]Okay, you have to get golden eggs.
[167:13.23]Take them back to the egg basket.
[167:17.49]Can I only hold one at a time?
[167:18.31]Okay, closet egg.
[167:41.88]Okay.
[167:42.28]So they can steal them and take them back, right?
[167:55.09]How many people play in a game?
[167:55.99]Okay.
[167:56.57]I think I get it.
[167:57.48]Okay.
[168:12.01]Okay.
[168:13.39]Communicating with your co-workers is an essential part of egg collection.
[168:19.29]What just happened?
[168:30.66]Oh, okay.
[168:31.62]Okay.
[168:36.06]So if everybody dies, it's over.
[168:38.76]Up is ask for help.
[168:40.78]Okay.
[168:40.90]Okay.
[168:44.74]Okay, I get it.
[168:48.31]It's like zombies.
[168:49.49]I actually never really played zombies at all.
[168:55.81]Cool.
[168:56.27]We have 100 seconds.
[169:21.49]Okay, got it.
[169:24.12]Grow your golden egg.
[169:25.56]Oh, so you can toss it to people.
[169:39.69]I got it.
[169:40.21]Alright.
[169:48.21]So you have to stay alive till the end.
[170:01.18]Do you get points for doing extra golden eggs or no?
[170:11.68]Or oh, you do, I think.
[170:22.61]OK.
[170:25.73]Literally on screen.
[170:31.60]You only get two uses of your special.
[170:39.89]Who has this move?
[170:41.27]Because that's amazing.
[170:42.65]That's so much fun.
[170:49.60]Whose move is this?
[171:03.42]They do?
[171:03.76]The Tri-Slosher?
[171:04.71]Alright.
[171:05.47]I want to try.
[171:05.91]I want to play with that.
[171:17.48]But first, another round of training.
[171:31.11]Alright.
[171:31.65]This is an important one.
[171:32.75]Alright, I'll pay attention.
[171:36.01]Okay.
[172:02.78]The not basics.
[172:06.06]There are 11 kinds of bosses.
[172:09.67]Which one do you want?
[172:10.49]Does it matter?
[172:13.39]This one?
[172:24.48]Do all of them.
[172:26.24]Just do all of them.
[172:27.58]Okay.
[172:29.98]Place a bomb?
[172:40.75]What do you mean, place a bomb?
[172:42.57]Does that count?
[172:56.48]Oh.
[172:56.78]Alright, steelhead.
[172:59.28]It lobs giant, smelly... What does it say?
[173:05.62]Shoot the bomb on his head.
[173:21.34]I don't have the range to hit that.
[173:32.47]I can't reach that far.
[173:53.64]That happened so fast.
[174:03.97]Dude, what the fuck?
[174:33.77]Launches missiles, toss a bomb into both of its missile launchers.
[175:29.79]I was gonna say, if that did not go in there... Okay.
[175:41.54]This is much easier with four players.
[175:50.86]Yeah.
[175:52.49]Alright, Scrapper.
[175:58.75]covers its frail body and shields made of cookware and putters forward.
[176:03.20]Okay.
[176:04.14]Get behind it.
[176:08.66]Okay.
[176:33.51]Alright, we're like almost halfway there.
[176:39.43]Don't let it touch you.
[176:43.20]The slimy pilot is sitting in the tail end, so he hit it in the tail.
[176:50.76]Wait, do I really have to do all these?
[176:51.92]I feel like I could just be in voice chat and somebody would just peek, blow out their microphone screaming at me for what I need to do.
[176:59.50]And then call me a bunch of names because I didn't do it right.
[177:01.26]And then I'll figure it out.
[177:02.74]I'll learn.
[177:16.16]We're almost done, I might as well do more.
[177:18.80]Stinger.
[177:20.77]Sits on top of a tower.
[177:21.81]Okay.
[177:51.74]Did that one.
[177:52.78]Alright, Drizzler.
[177:55.76]Fire his torpedoes that create clouds that rain ink.
[177:58.67]When it's under its umbrella, your attacks can't hurt it.
[178:02.88]So he peeks.
[178:04.42]You can also hit its rockets to knock them back.
[178:06.70]Alright.
[178:34.34]Alright fish stick They plant a pillar in the ground then fly in circles around the top and spray ink all over The pillar will stick around once they're gone.
[178:57.53]So put it to good use Alright, you have to climb the pillar
[179:21.38]I get it.
[179:21.62]Alright, flipper.
[179:34.83]Throws out an ink ring, then dives into it.
[179:36.67]Do not get caught inside the ring.
[179:38.25]Cover the ring in your own ink before it can dive, then it'll flop.
[179:43.30]Alright.
[180:01.58]I'm a salmon runner and it gets much harder than this.
[180:03.56]I would imagine it does.
[180:04.36]I think I see more.
[180:07.98]Big shot launcher.
[180:10.76]Jump over the shockwaves from the cannonballs.
[180:51.69]Use the cannon.
[180:52.23]Alright, this is a UFO.
[180:56.95]Walk under it and it'll try to squash you.
[180:59.92]If it tries to squash you and you dodge, you can climb on top of it and take it out.

[199:28.39]Where's this boss?
[199:31.27]6 out of 6.
[199:31.57]I feel like we missed out on something.
[199:43.42]Did we miss out on something?
[199:45.42]Or was I not on the right side?
[199:49.62]96 gal?
[199:52.45]This does not seem like the greatest thing to spread out paint.
[200:30.62]Do a taunt?

[201:28.46]We're good, right?
[201:34.58]Oh my god, we just got absolutely detonated.

[201:39.87]We're good.
[201:49.65]Alright, final wave.
[201:59.52]I guess I fell in the water.

[203:00.51]Booyah!
[203:18.18]Holy shit!
[203:44.09]So this is the gentleman's cod zombies?
[203:52.65]Is this webcam going at like 2 FPS?
[203:54.58]Do one more because it's going to be so hard now.
[204:05.68]Okay.
[204:12.32]Alright, now I'm at part timer.
[204:13.70]Another surprise egg.
[204:21.97]Let's do it again.
[204:33.29]Gonna be a bit harder.
[204:58.24]I'm so happy you're playing this.
[204:59.06]This is my favorite mode.
[205:02.38]I did not know there was this much content in Splatoon.
[205:09.00]I saw Splatoon as like a side game.
[205:14.16]I don't know why.
[205:16.30]Like, oh yeah, it's just an extra game mode for this other.
[205:19.62]It's like an extra game.
[205:21.00]It's like Portal in the orange box.
[205:23.98]But Portal was awesome.
[205:25.00]I don't know why I was like, yeah, it's just like a game.
[205:28.31]It's not really a game.
[205:30.43]I didn't know there was this much to do.
[205:48.81]All I ever knew Splatoon was as the Wii U big brick side game.
[205:56.17]That's all I knew.
[206:07.79]Monster.
[206:11.61]That's what you call an A-minus move.
[206:57.82]We need that!
[207:03.36]Throw it in!
[207:05.02]It's alright.
[207:11.67]The game is going to get content updates for two more years for free.
[207:14.51]Really?
[207:19.79]I just thought this was the Wii U brick side game.
[207:23.91]I didn't know.
[207:37.39]Help, help, help, help, help!
[207:38.47]It's alright.
[207:39.83]It's okay.
[207:40.15]It's alright.
[207:40.63]I got one in.
[207:40.97]It's alright.
[207:51.20]Come on, man.
[207:51.78]I gotta get over there.
[208:01.74]Did I go in?
[208:02.54]Alright, good.
[208:24.31]Ah, he's weird behind a wall.
[208:26.33]Good, got it.
[208:46.18]I'll take left side.
[208:48.36]We have ruined the left side.
[209:11.27]They can't hear you.
[209:12.16]I know.
[209:16.13]Best weapon in the game.
[210:06.07]Looking good, right?
[210:07.85]Just a couple more.
[210:18.97]What's raining on us?
[210:19.73]Something's raining on us.
[210:27.10]What is firing...
[210:46.16]Oh shit, it's that!
[210:47.18]Oh my god.
[210:54.37]Get up there!
[211:02.46]Pick one of these up!
[211:03.64]What's happening to my body?
[211:05.24]What the hell was that?
[211:06.06]I couldn't pick one up!
[211:13.52]Why couldn't I pick one up?
[211:14.26]I had one.
[211:17.64]No, I had one.
[211:25.99]This is as fun as the regular game.
[211:31.61]This is really cool.
[211:33.59]I like this a lot.
[211:39.75]I'm going to get to the next rank.
[211:44.39]And we'll see.
[211:46.54]I do want to play Breath of the Wild for at least an hour or two.
[211:50.06]Or do I just play Splatoon and the Breath of the Wild fans are going to be very mad about this?
[211:54.22]I don't know.
[211:55.86]What should I do?
[212:04.78]Breath of the Wild has a lot of fans.
[212:06.34]I'm not sure they would like that.
[212:19.03]I do a pull.
[212:21.49]Do you want me to continue playing Splatoon for the rest of the stream and whatever?
[212:26.66]Splatoon, more Splatoon or Breath of the Wild in another 30 minutes?
[212:31.18]Breath of the Wild in 30 minutes or Splatoon for the rest of the stream?
[212:49.18]It's gonna get hard.
[213:04.99]Oh, I need to be the one that hits that.
[213:06.11]This is my job.
[213:07.21]I gotta get up top.
[213:11.57]I got it.
[213:12.82]Oh, you got it.
[213:13.22]You're good.
[213:40.51]Oh my god!
[214:29.90]Oh, OK, we're good.
[214:30.78]Alright, what are we doing?
[214:34.78]Splatoon 1 by a lot.
[214:43.32]Oh man, that was close.
[214:47.02]That was so close.
[214:51.88]That's so close.
[214:53.74]Is that too close to call?
[214:54.82]No, it's not.
[214:55.71]It's over.
[215:18.01]Chainsaw.
[215:33.30]Have the trash can.
[215:56.85]Trash can.
[216:11.34]Thank you!
[216:20.31]Why won't this thing fucking die?
[216:27.19]Alright, we're good.
[216:32.34]Do another fold?
[216:33.14]That's not how it works, man.
[216:34.36]2,000 people voted out of 15,000.
[216:36.80]Watch out, the dog.
[217:19.52]Roger that.
[217:21.62]Umbrella.
[217:44.10]Giant.
[217:50.95]Giant!
[218:32.69]Who are you talking to?
[218:41.70]You should delay the switch break.
[218:45.04]What else is there play?
[219:03.90]What else is there to play?
[219:07.07]Not much, right?
[219:18.33]So what do I... I gotta leave, right?
[219:20.17]I wanna get my shit.
[219:26.23]So where do I do that?
[219:27.21]I have to be out of the lobby?
[219:37.86]Front desk.
[219:40.94]Where's that?
[219:44.22]You can do Mario Odyssey.
[219:45.02]I already played Mario Odyssey.
[219:46.02]I already beat it.
[219:47.64]On my own time.
[219:51.47]It's in this room.
[219:58.51]Oh, here we go.
[220:00.97]Okay.
[220:02.17]Let's open it.
[220:02.97]Ooh, what did I get?
[220:10.23]Swap for chunks?
[220:14.15]What about... I don't get it.
[220:17.73]Keep new gear.
[220:18.51]I mean, that one's better, right?
[220:23.63]I'll keep the new one.
[220:32.73]Slop suit?
[220:35.81]A green slop suit?
[220:39.62]I don't have enough.
[220:43.85]What the hell?
[220:54.38]Let's do it again.
[221:09.41]I'm almost at a part timer.
[221:20.74]Can you play grounded?
[221:21.48]I actually wanted to play it.
[221:26.53]I actually wanted to try it.
[221:29.51]Is it fun?
[221:29.97]Okay.
[221:49.25]I'm trying to give us some avenues here.
[222:02.65]Shit!
[222:03.01]There's a perfect throw, too.
[222:12.86]Oh!
[222:34.08]We need it.
[222:35.96]Equestria time!
[223:04.70]We're good.
[223:05.06]We're good.
[223:05.30]We're good.
[223:05.54]We're fine.
[223:13.89]Don't hit me off.
[223:23.43]Oh, my God.
[223:24.37]I hate water so much.
[223:26.09]I'm never drinking it ever again.
[223:27.67]Only Gatorade from now on.
[223:29.02]Only Gatorade.
[223:46.77]Why is it getting so dark?
[223:49.89]A giant tornado is approaching.
[223:56.70]What does that mean?
[223:59.40]Where's my teammates?
[223:59.96]Where'd they go?
[224:21.66]Oh, we're good.
[224:23.04]Okay, that was fun.
[224:52.86]What happens if you get them all?
[224:57.12]We got every single one.
[225:00.18]There's a big golden chest over here.
[225:08.65]Holy shit, what?
[225:09.61]Alright, I have an idea.
[225:12.58]I'm gonna throw them over here and you guys get them and throw them that way.
[225:30.18]We're good.
[225:32.17]That was a lot.
[225:39.55]Alright, final wave.
[226:13.87]Over here we got at least five or six.
[226:19.39]Oh my god, I'm never drinking water!
[226:22.58]I'm never going swimming, I'm never gonna drink water, I'm only gonna... Oh my god, it's me!
[226:38.37]We're dead!
[226:44.68]We all died instantly.
[226:45.76]That was instantaneous.
[226:47.18]Holy shit.
[226:54.24]That was just... We all popped in five seconds.
[226:56.40]Jerma, you're 70% water.
[227:02.15]Get it out of me.
[227:02.69]Get it off me.
[227:05.59]That one doesn't count.
[227:13.13]That one doesn't count.
[227:19.74]Why is my camera so frame ratey right now?
[227:22.82]Is it?
[227:23.06]Kind of is.
[227:24.89]Why is it so frame ratey?
[227:31.59]That one doesn't count.
[227:51.92]When are you going to play Breath of the Wild?
[227:53.12]Okay, so it was 53 to 47%.
[228:10.84]What does my vote count for?
[228:13.38]How many percentage points does my vote count for? 5%?
[228:27.92]I would probably say at least 10%.
[228:29.10]Like, how many shares of my own company do I own?
[228:32.00]Right?
[228:32.14]That's gotta be a lot.
[229:17.98]Do any streamers play this game?
[229:25.32]Deadass.
[229:25.70]I'm going to leave the stream if you don't.
[229:27.27]It's rare.
[229:38.31]Vinny does?
[229:40.39]Vinny plays?
[229:40.87]Hmm.
[229:41.89]Hmm.
[229:51.24]Shit, watch out!
[230:03.19]Streamers are surprised that Nintendo games are fun.
[230:24.23]We have some mods.
[230:25.45]We have some mod opinions here.
[230:27.86]I have a senior investor.
[230:29.46]I have a good chunk of stock.
[230:31.40]Well, alright, Leather Jacket.
[230:32.54]What's your share vote?
[231:04.24]Typing.
[231:21.41]Get out of the fucking way!
[231:23.51]You're so annoying!
[231:38.24]Leatherjacket is deferring choice to streamer's choice.
[231:43.00]Okay.
[231:44.92]I'm just sitting around.
[231:45.54]I'm the CEO, god damn it.
[231:59.26]VRJosh has deferred his voice to the CEO.
[232:11.37]Grump said that seems like you're enjoying Splatoon.
[232:15.81]I defer my voice to streamers choice, which is Splatoon 3.
[232:21.12]Why can't I talk?
[232:24.98]It's just I'm speech jamming myself.
[232:26.36]What's this?
[232:35.57]What do we have to do with this?
[232:37.29]ZL.
[232:39.96]What do I do about what's this?
[232:40.82]What do we do with that?
[233:33.87]Bro, what's happening?
[233:35.17]I don't even understand this game mode.
[233:36.41]Why are there big giant marbles everywhere?
[233:59.52]This fucking orbital strike fly fish.
[234:15.66]Well, somebody explain to me what those, those bait, giant bait balls were.
[234:21.37]They didn't even, they were not, I didn't even know what they were.
[234:25.41]ZL, look at this huge ball.
[234:27.33]This is a weird game mode.
[234:28.86]What was that?
[234:29.34]I thought we had to move those.
[234:33.26]I would have been in there with the team.
[234:39.15]They're turrets?
[234:50.68]I thought I had to roll those down into the basket.
[234:54.43]They look just like this.
[234:55.65]They're the same exact color, the same sheen, everything.
[234:58.01]They're the same color, same sheen, same metal.
[235:19.87]Alright, so we have three mods that have deferred their shares.
[235:38.00]I mean, I've got to see what Burgah Boy has to say.
[235:40.30]He's one of the biggest shareholders.
[235:44.42]Hey, dude.
[235:45.46]Need your opinion on...
[235:48.74]I need a share vote on a game.
[235:50.30]Hold on.
[235:51.12]Is he watching?
[235:51.68]Let's see.
[235:54.99]Breath of the Wild or Splatoon.
[235:58.07]Need opinion.
[235:59.17]Need votes for your shares.
[236:00.57]You have 20,000.
[236:24.65]He's typing.
[236:32.62]Bro, your stream sucks now.
[236:34.02]I sold all my shares a year and a half ago.
[236:52.47]Do it again.
[236:53.65]What's this weird golden one?
[237:21.21]What the fuck is this little weirdo?
[237:25.55]Why are you using your special in wave one?
[237:30.64]I've never even seen that guy before.
[237:32.38]Oh, wait.
[237:41.30]I have three shares left.
[237:42.46]Forgot about them.
[237:44.66]I put my three shares to Splatoon.
[237:46.41]Okay.
[237:52.29]Wait, you lose rank?
[237:55.41]That's not good.
[238:18.45]Alright, time to pay attention.
[238:20.71]No more fucking around.
[238:50.02]Stunlock.
[239:26.60]Dude, don't nade the team!
[239:27.82]Look at these players, man.
[239:30.16]I swear to God.
[239:34.56]Don't nade the team!
[239:35.72]They're playing like fucking bronze players.
[240:24.57]Uh, Dr. Clay, throw my shares in the air.
[240:27.00]Wherever they land is where they will go.
[240:32.52]Oh, what the fuck, dude?
[240:35.40]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[240:36.42]They all landed on Splatoon.
[240:37.42]That's weird.
[240:38.78]Heads!
[240:39.30]Heads!
[240:39.62]Whoa!
[240:44.01]That one landed on its edge, which I'll put that to Breath of the Wild.
[240:47.14]That's fair.
[240:47.60]Alright, pay fucking attention to the game, you moron.
[240:51.10]What am I doing?
[240:51.61]I'm like, I'm away from the entire team.
[241:30.10]Oh my!
[241:31.40]Let's get this thing away from... Why is it attacking me?
[241:37.44]Of all the people... There's four of us here.
[241:39.10]Why is it attacking me?
[241:42.22]Why do I have all the aggro of every single enemy in the whole entire map?
[241:54.35]We all did it!
[241:55.33]I wasn't the only one.
[241:56.19]I wasn't the only one.
[241:56.85]I wasn't the only one.
[242:25.77]We're good.
[242:26.47]We're doing alright.
[242:30.27]I actually really don't like this weapon.
[242:38.26]Where they at?
[242:40.58]Over here.
[242:43.19]There's a little snail thing.
[243:56.84]Oh shit We did it 20 out of 8 we kind of cleaned up there we lost a player
[244:32.98]Uh-oh.
[244:35.33]Mandatory overtime.
[244:36.13]Here's an egg cannon.
[244:36.87]Get to work.
[244:37.91]Somebody else use that.
[244:38.61]I don't know what that does.
[244:56.47]What?! !
[245:01.32]That was stupid.
[245:02.80]What?
[245:03.20]He blew up the entire map?
[245:06.04]We all die instantly.
[245:07.96]He kills everybody and you can't get away?
[245:09.98]What are you supposed to do?
[245:11.40]What are you supposed to do?
[245:19.48]We lost a player.
[245:38.31]Is Breath of the Wild canceled?
[245:39.35]I just want to know because it's late here and I want to leave.
[245:41.39]Shit, people want to see Breath of the Wild.
[245:56.38]Alright, um... Alright.
[246:02.09]Alright.
[246:04.93]Alright.
[246:06.88]I'm going to extend the switch on Sunday.
[246:14.15]Here's what's going to happen.
[246:14.95]Are you ready?
[246:15.65]Listen to me.
[246:17.95]All the shareholders need to listen.
[246:20.44]I was going to do like a half Breath of the Wild stream, half Splatoon stream today.
[246:25.79]And I didn't do that.
[246:28.19]But I'm doing Splatoon right now.
[246:30.65]But you know what that means?
[246:31.97]Listen to me, shareholders.
[246:33.79]That means that it will be an entire stream of Breath of the Wild on Sunday.
[246:40.76]I was going to leave the Switch on Sunday.
[246:44.10]Are we okay with that compromise?
[246:48.98]What the hell is this?
[246:55.13]Can I get a vote?
[246:55.87]Can we get a shareholders vote please?
[246:58.46]Are you okay with Sunday being an entire day of Breath of the Wild?
[247:34.10]Nothing.
[247:45.45]Place we're doing on Sunday, too.
[247:46.85]No.
[247:53.39]We're kind of going fracked out here. 23?
[248:16.16]What are these new enemies Shoot it in the mouth
[248:48.00]Booyah, booyah, booyah!
[248:52.78]Oh my goodness, that's a lot.
[248:54.08]I don't understand this one.
[249:13.37]How does this one work?
[249:21.37]Ooh, easy.
[249:56.69]Dude, Breath of the Wild, 82%.
[249:57.39]What?
[249:57.63]Only 1,400 shareholders.
[249:58.41]What's going on?
[249:59.05]This was for... Oh, this was for Sunday.
[249:59.93]Okay.
[250:32.40]How is that not hitting you?
[250:59.83]Oh, we're way far away.
[251:27.00]Oh, I'm bad.
[251:28.96]Forget.
[251:38.82]Will you land already?
[251:50.69]Dude, why wouldn't that thing land?
[251:53.72]Yeah, we'll do a full Breath of the Wild stream on Sunday.
[251:56.04]That makes more sense to me.
[251:57.36]I may have been going for four hours, four and a half hours or so.
[252:04.28]Am I going to go to Breath of the Wild for like an hour and 45 minutes, two hours?
[252:10.99]We'll do a full six to seven hour stream on Sunday of Breath of the Wild.
[252:31.47]Ooh, alright.
[252:34.66]Rank up.
[252:41.20]Are you going to complete Breath of the Wild?
[252:48.27]I don't know.
[252:53.11]I'm going to play it until it's no longer fun for me.
[252:56.30]Which, maybe I'll beat the whole thing.
[253:15.27]You postponed Breath of the Wild twice, you're doing it a third time?
[253:17.47]Breath of the Wild is the last thing I streamed before this.
[253:30.46]Who remembers Omega Weekend?
[253:34.64]Hey, Omega Weekend I streamed for 14 hours in a row.
[253:37.95]That's the longest stream I've ever done.
[253:40.48]I am going to say on the record that that was an Omega weekend.
[253:44.68]That was literally a 14 hour stream.
[253:46.20]I don't do those.
[253:47.34]I will never do one of those ever again.
[253:48.92]That was an Omega weekend.
[253:49.86]Hey, you went to sleep and woke up and I was still streaming.
[253:55.15]I didn't do that.
[253:55.61]I stayed up.

[255:38.33]So?

[255:47.46]I was streaming for like eight or nine hours before I did that.
[256:21.59]Holy shit.

[260:34.49]Maybe somebody can help.
[260:35.75]It starts going like... And I have to like hold the power, but I have to unplug the switch.
[261:02.36]I gotta pay attention.

[266:54.69]51 eggs.
[266:57.47]That's a lot.
[266:57.89]We lost a player.
[266:58.33]That wasn't fair.
[267:17.10]Almost there.
[267:17.48]Another hat.
[267:30.93]You lost viewers?
[267:32.83]No, sorry.
[267:33.83]Those viewers are just, they now know they have a day or two to prepare.
[267:36.64]So they're going to order the like 10 foot long Subway sandwich and have a party when I do the Breath of the Wild stream on Sunday.
[267:44.74]They're just preparing.
[267:45.40]They just gotta go and figure out what they're gonna do.
[267:50.39]I want one of those right now.
[267:51.23]I could probably eat the whole thing.
[268:09.35]I don't know.
[268:10.27]I don't think I would stop eating it.
[268:12.33]If you got me like a cheese steak, like a six foot long cheese steak.
[268:18.28]And it was just like, oh, hey, by the way, like no one else is going to eat this.
[268:21.22]Like you can have it.
[268:22.32]I'd be like, really?
[268:44.81]Oh my goodness.

[269:42.45]We're good.
[269:42.69]We don't have to get anything more than a quarter.
[269:44.81]That's fine.
[269:53.91]Yeah, nice cheesesteak.
[270:05.20]Play Stardew Valley?
[270:06.06]I played that a long time ago.
[270:10.40]That was like one of my first things I did on Twitch.
[271:01.60]Uh-oh.
[271:21.26]Come to me.
[271:21.62]Walk to me.
[271:23.42]Walk to me.

[274:04.05]How do I not die from this?
[274:08.29]Just get the fuck out of the way.
[274:14.27]I'm out of the way.
[274:24.19]I'm getting out of the way.
[274:25.69]I'm out of the way.
[274:27.45]Where is he?
[274:28.63]Is this hitting?
[274:45.00]I'm gonna be Grenade Andy.
[274:45.72]Where's the person that's died?
[275:04.66]I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.
[275:05.80]Come here, come here, come here.
[275:21.85]Keep on the lookout for other monsters.

[275:59.83]So close.
[276:00.29]So close.
[276:00.93]You throw the eggs at... Okay.
[276:02.28]60 eggs.
[276:02.70]Okay.
[276:17.36]Hold on.
[276:18.00]Excuse me.
[276:19.16]I ate your sub order last week.
[276:21.69]It was mid.
[276:23.43]Sorry.
[276:26.21]What's my sub order?
[276:32.13]It was mid.
[276:33.86]What's my sub order?
[276:37.84]It was mid.
[276:38.78]It was mid.
[276:39.34]A C?
[276:41.44]Like a C plus?
[276:42.14]That's fucking fine.
[276:44.76]Mid, it's like a medium.
[276:46.00]It's like mid.
[276:46.88]That means it's good.
[276:48.44]That means you didn't dislike it.
[276:49.86]You thought it was okay.
[276:50.82]So what?
[276:54.06]It was meatball sub?
[277:02.22]You're a fucking boomer.
[277:05.63]Mid means bad.
[277:07.55]To me, mid means like middle of the road.
[277:09.65]Like, that was mid.
[277:11.87]That was middle.
[277:13.17]That was like a C.
[277:23.45]it does mean that but what are we complaining about you said that my suborder was like a medium on the scale of how good something was that's alright you could have said it sucked you could have said hey dude your suborder is dog I know I understand that but medium okay that's alright alright
[278:18.07]That was a good grenade.
[278:19.13]Holy shit.
[278:19.63]Nice work.
[278:30.95]Thank you.
[278:40.19]Oh, that's a shitty place for that to be.
[278:58.90]We gotta get at least two zero, right?
[279:02.38]Yeah, but what was the order?
[279:11.09]Was it the meatball sub?
[279:15.27]I mean, a meatball sub is not my order.
[279:17.01]It's one of a handful of a lot of sandwiches I like to eat.
[279:26.10]It's a griller?
[279:37.30]I got you, I got you, I got you.
[279:40.16]Come to me.
[279:47.71]Can one of the mods tell me what sandwich it was?
[280:27.69]Two grillers.
[280:41.37]God.
[280:42.65]Damn it.
[280:56.61]Oh my God, who cares?
[281:03.71]We did it.
[281:03.97]OK, first of all.
[281:09.69]A meatball sub is by very definition a mid sandwich.
[281:14.88]That's not a bad thing.
[281:18.34]Final wave OK OK hold on.
[281:50.04]I'm gonna use my ultimate, ultimate, ultimate, ultimate.
[281:52.35]Anybody alive?
[282:07.84]Dude, I just saved us all.
[282:38.70]Holy shit, 30.
[282:39.44]Are you kidding me?
[282:49.19]That was a lot.
[283:04.06]Okay, so what I was saying is
[283:09.03]A meatball sub is a very basic kind of generic sandwich.
[283:13.56]It is mid by its on its own.
[283:15.22]It is mid by default.
[283:19.02]I like meatball subs.
[283:19.88]I think they're great.
[283:20.44]A little bit provolone, that's it.
[283:30.48]I asked you in the slime rancher stream.
[283:32.10]That's what you answered.
[283:35.00]Depends on the day.
[283:50.18]Alright.
[283:51.14]Let me get to the next rank and then I'll do the other game mode.
[283:57.40]Meatball subs are good.
[283:58.10]Yeah, I know.
[283:58.75]What's the problem?
[284:04.73]If you want to know what one of my favorite soft sandwiches is, okay.
[284:08.61]A cheesesteak, like a Philly cheesesteak.
[284:11.17]With grilled onions on it.
[284:13.03]And a shitload of mayo.
[284:15.85]Ew.
[284:16.87]Quiet.
[284:18.31]That's up there pretty high.
[284:24.16]A chicken cutlet sandwich.
[284:26.54]Chicken cutlet, lettuce, tomato.
[284:30.66]Fresh chicken cutlet.
[284:31.38]Holy shit.
[284:35.02]Not much is better than that.
[284:55.82]Mayo, mayo, gross.
[284:59.12]If you do not understand that mayo can seriously bring out a bunch of delicious flavors and everything else, I don't know what to tell you.
[285:12.14]A chicken cutlet sandwich with lettuce, tomato, mayo?
[285:19.03]I need a detailed answer of how that doesn't taste fantastic.
[285:23.93]I don't get you.
[285:24.99]Alright, I'm just shooting in the air.
[285:27.81]I gotta play.
[285:33.58]Oh my God, I thought I actually got that.

[286:42.19]I seriously don't.
[286:48.39]Okay.
[287:06.36]Don't touch those.
[287:09.13]Oh my god, I look like I just installed the fucking game five minutes ago.

[288:04.68]How did that not kill it?
[288:07.88]No, that doesn't count.
[288:08.90]I was too busy talking about fucking like cream cheese and mayonnaise on a sandwich.
[288:19.82]What's your Starbucks order?
[288:22.57]Uh, a venti cold brew with a little bit of oat milk or almond milk and then three pumps of toffee nut.

[302:52.19]Oh my god, this is so frustrating.
[303:13.57]We have so many things to throw.
[303:18.31]Where's this big bird?
[303:23.28]I can't, man.
[303:31.29]It's just, I can't, you can't even see what's happening.
[303:49.06]throw the eggs.
[303:49.88]Dude, I can't throw the eggs when I'm being puked on by 5,000 different enemies.
[303:55.61]They're all like, stunlock, stunlock, stunlock, stunlock.
[303:58.99]I can't even see.
[304:01.11]Dude, that's one of those encounters that you have to be in a fucking vent call.
[304:06.31]You've got to be in a Discord call to even do that.
[304:10.84]It's going to be like, corner, corner, corner.
[304:12.90]Go, go, go, go, go.
[304:13.44]Yep, yep.
[304:13.70]Starting.
[304:15.06]We have to all be yelling at each other.
[304:17.94]You're going to be in vent yelling at each other.
[304:19.57]It's the only way that works.
[304:31.61]Dude, get on vent.
[304:41.33]I'm going in, going in, going in.
[304:42.11]Okay.
[304:42.83]I'm there, I'm there, I'm there.
[304:56.99]My voice is just gone too.
[304:58.17]What happened today?
[305:03.13]You have so many hats.
[305:07.87]Do I have way too many hats?
[305:09.19]Should I go look at them?
[305:10.06]30 hats.
[305:27.18]What about Breath of the Wild?
[305:32.18]I'm borrowing my friend's Switch today.
[305:33.52]We decided because he wanted to play Breath of the Wild for this weekend.
[305:39.12]And I want to play Splatoon and he had Splatoon and I had Breath of the Wild.
[305:42.68]So we traded Switches for a weekend.
[305:51.67]So I'll get it back.
[305:56.28]It's so fucking annoying though.
[305:57.62]His switch is wicked greasy.
[305:59.18]Okay.
[305:59.70]There's like stains all over the shoulder.
[306:06.02]Fingers.
[306:13.18]Get me up here.
[306:14.44]I can't even play the game.
[306:19.92]This is such a shitty place.
[306:25.01]Okay, what happened?
[306:27.01]Can somebody explain what happened right here?
[306:31.04]Why did we all just get such shit on?
[306:57.23]I can't!
[306:57.77]I have to leave!
[307:06.72]Ah!
[307:07.22]Time to join vent!
[307:10.71]left square bracket right square bracket left square bracket right square bracket left square bracket right square bracket left square bracket right square bracket left square bracket right square bracket left square bracket live have left the channel oh come on
[307:40.25]You're so bad at this game.
[307:41.39]I'm currently in the overachiever level.
[307:44.88]And I'm not in vent.
[307:46.70]And it's my first time, first day ever playing Splatoon.
[307:50.08]And I've got my friend's greasy ass switch in my hands.
[307:58.21]It's got a huge crack down the middle.
[308:01.23]You can clearly tell that it was next to his bed.
[308:05.07]He got wicked tired and put it down over there in the middle of a Diablo II remastered session.
[308:14.30]And he got up in the morning and he didn't know it was there and he stepped on it with his heel and cracked the screen.
[308:20.76]I actually did that to my iPad.
[308:28.60]to replace Diablo II Remastered with Cookie Run Kingdom or something.
[308:34.21]I don't know.
[308:40.71]Over here.
[309:22.33]oh my god
[309:58.69]Yeah, don't even run into me you puke stain Don't die fuck we're gonna get demoted again
[310:24.86]I think we got really far.
[310:26.00]We're all hitting gamer fatigue.
[310:29.32]We're hitting gamer fatigue and that's what's going on.
[310:30.90]I've been playing with the same players for like an hour.
[310:37.49]It's gamer fatigue.
[310:38.63]It's alright.
[310:39.93]We'll be fine.
[310:41.19]I'll go back to turf war.
[311:03.58]What's that?
[311:09.66]So I should swap for chunks?
[311:17.67]What about this?
[311:19.61]Which one's better?
[311:20.09]It's up to you.
[311:27.92]What am I looking at here?
[311:38.82]Keep it.
[311:40.34]Is it better?
[311:47.04]Run speed up, but I don't know.
[311:54.03]Keep this.
[312:00.69]Oh, that's a triple.
[312:04.63]That's a triple right there.
[312:10.66]Where's the triple?
[312:14.36]Didn't I just get a triple?
[312:15.50]Are you telling me that's all I got for playing that game mode for two hours?
[312:26.18]I get 18 cents?
[312:27.68]I get 18 copper?
[312:29.12]That's it?
[312:41.57]Alright, let's do some of the regular game mode.
[312:46.53]Do I want to stay with this loadout?
[312:57.74]I think I'm okay with this.
[312:58.90]I don't think I unlocked anything though.
[313:02.98]Yeah, I'll stay with this.
[313:03.62]This works.
[313:21.91]How much longer are you going to stream for?
[313:22.93]I don't know, maybe like another 45 minutes, hour?
[313:27.65]I'll get to like 6 plus hours or so.
[313:31.20]And then we'll be back on Sunday with Breath of the Wild.
[313:35.62]Play the card game.
[313:54.63]I wonder how much better I'll be at this mode now that I played that much.
[313:59.71]New map though.
[314:23.32]Where you at?
[314:30.33]What are your thoughts on the game?
[314:36.30]It is a 9.9.
[315:01.42]Oh, at least I got it.
[315:26.07]That's going to be huge.
[316:01.75]It's a 9.9, 9.8, 8.7, 7.5, 8.5.
[316:02.45]Sorry.
[316:02.71]I got a little weird.
[316:03.75]I might need to recalibrate.
[316:33.82]Oh, you're in the enemy base?
[316:34.78]Let's go.
[316:35.18]It's alright.
[316:42.67]I think we still win.
[316:43.27]They're not going to take this all the way back, are they?
[316:49.41]No.
[317:14.26]Alright, read my lips.
[317:14.93]What am I saying?
[317:34.18]Yeah.
[317:35.88]Let's go.
[317:46.58]Do the gumball machine.
[317:53.45]I probably can't be in a lobby.
[317:57.65]There's no way this isn't a bit.
[317:58.75]What, top fragging in Splatoon 3 and being the best player on the team?
[318:06.98]It's happened.
[318:41.99]Where is everybody?
[318:49.63]Where is everybody?
[318:53.52]Where's their team?
[319:14.39]Can we get up there?
[319:22.93]Oh, that sucks!
[319:23.69]I gotta actually open that spawn.
[319:44.94]I'm confused words, everybody.
[321:29.68]number one turf anchor number one super jump spot and number one ground traveler play the card game I feel like I'm just getting good at this alright three more rounds with this weapon and then I'm gonna change weapons
[322:09.09]You ever gonna play this again?
[322:09.89]Um... It's really fun.
[322:14.63]I don't see why not.
[322:21.12]I just didn't get it.
[322:21.66]It's kind of like how I felt about Dark Souls before I actually understood what it was.
[322:26.04]Try Ranked.
[322:40.93]I don't know if I'm going to rank today.
[322:41.97]This is a huge map.
[323:17.83]Don't you dare.
[323:19.19]Don't you dare!
[323:19.91]I hit every single button.
[323:35.68]I hit every single button but the right one.
[323:40.52]I didn't know how to detonate it.
[323:41.78]I forgot.
[324:18.49]Did I do that?
[324:49.86]that shit out of here.
[324:50.56]Come on down.
[325:10.40]Come on down.
[325:10.86]Come on down.
[325:41.19]There we go.
[325:46.73]That's a win.
[325:48.15]There's no way I fell asleep and you're still playing Splatoon.
[326:00.17]Have you even seen Salmon run yet?
[326:03.46]Like Salmon the food?
[326:04.18]What's that person talking about?
[326:07.04]Salmon the food?
[326:10.91]I like it.
[326:28.78]How do you do that?
[326:43.19]Let's go.
[326:55.89]I'm going to do weapon change after this.
[326:57.03]This is the third one.
[326:59.29]See if I can unlock anything new.
[327:20.12]Bro, don't make me get up there.
[327:25.65]Secure the kill, goddammit.
[327:27.05]Secure the kill!
[327:27.77]I thought there was somebody next to me.
[327:39.68]There is.
[327:53.21]Ah, I walked into it.
[328:18.34]Surprise!
[328:30.27]We just doubled?
[328:32.11]Hell yeah.
[328:36.16]Oh.
[328:37.28]Okay.
[328:38.52]Nice cheating.
[329:41.74]See ya.
[330:02.27]That's a win.
[330:02.83]Ooh, no it's not.
[330:05.31]It's not.
[330:10.15]What happened?
[330:11.39]They had their mecha thing.
[330:13.54]Alright, we're going to do a different weapon.
[330:20.60]New weapon.
[330:30.28]That was a good fight.
[330:31.34]That was actually a good match.
[330:42.02]Sorry, Andy.
[330:42.44]What do you think?
[331:10.82]Would you recommend this game?
[331:12.04]Yes.
[331:12.26]100%.
[331:19.61]In my mind, this was a six, but in reality, it's at least an eight.
[332:28.89]I fucked up.
[332:29.49]I fucked up.
[332:30.64]My fingers got locked up.
[332:32.22]Gamer fatigue for like six hours.
[332:33.61]Gamer fatigue.
[332:34.41]I got locked up.
[333:12.81]I got a direct hit too.
[333:29.56]Oh my god, we're getting destroyed.
[333:30.98]This is a domination.
[333:38.84]Switch weapons, look what happens.
[333:51.81]I switch fucking weapons, look what happens.
[333:52.95]This thing's junk.
[334:21.32]Dude, I don't even know where anybody is.
[334:22.36]Dude, is it weird that the orange and purple fucks with my head?
[334:30.97]It makes it hard for me to play.
[334:32.27]I feel like it's hard for me to see what's going on.
[334:36.59]Anybody else like that?
[334:50.56]You gonna join the Valorant scene?
[334:52.20]No, dude, never.
[334:53.86]No way.
[334:59.06]I'm gonna buy a new weapon.
[335:13.67]Thanks, Junk.
[335:18.73]You look unhinged today.
[335:22.75]God, I want a buffalo chicken sub so bad.
[335:30.97]Alright, so what do we got?
[335:36.21]This is the better roller.
[335:37.71]Should I try the umbrella?
[335:38.43]No, you know what?
[335:40.59]Let's try this.
[335:44.74]This theme seemed pretty cool.
[336:17.25]Seems like a pretty good spread.
[336:18.13]Alright, so what's this do?
[336:41.86]Press R?
[336:42.34]Wait, what's going on?
[336:46.77]What is this?
[336:53.26]It slows?
[336:54.52]Oh, that's kind of good.
[337:00.98]Oh, that's who does that move.
[337:02.62]Alright.
[337:04.89]Okay, that's right.
[337:08.07]Okay.
[337:12.43]Makes him lose ink.
[337:18.65]That's right.
[337:27.48]Oops, wrong button.
[337:33.74]It's an outfit so you don't look like a lame librarian.
[337:37.90]It's a new outfit.
[337:38.62]I've had it for like an hour.
[338:10.51]So this thing, the target rises up.
[338:17.73]Kind of weird.
[338:19.74]While you hold the button down, your cursor goes up.
[338:21.58]What was that weapon?
[338:25.08]That thing was cool.
[338:27.46]A chainsaw?
[339:15.37]I don't know about this.
[339:16.25]I don't know about this.
[339:21.08]It takes too long.
[339:39.62]This thing sucks ass.
[339:41.16]This is the worst weapon of the whole game.
[340:47.03]Fucking glad I used a Willy Wonka ticket on this piece of shit.
[341:39.34]F tier.
[342:24.77]This is what I'm talking about.
[342:25.47]This is a fucking real weapon.
[342:40.70]Alright, let's do it.
[342:52.17]So are they ink or are they squids?
[342:54.87]What are they?
[342:56.66]We just came out of a box.
[343:14.86]That was a good start.
[343:37.51]Use the vending machine.
[343:38.13]Alright, after this match, I'm gonna go spend some money.
[343:39.71]Can you do a dab, please?
[343:49.48]Is it 2017?
[343:53.10]Why do you want me to do a dab?
[344:48.32]They're grouping.
[344:49.24]They're grouping.
[344:49.86]They're on event call.
[344:50.76]They're on event call.
[344:52.85]They're all on event call.
[344:54.03]They queued up as a party.
[345:08.48]Land.
[345:08.72]Come on, land.
[345:33.39]I really don't like that super.
[345:34.41]I think it's terrible.
[345:35.26]Oh, you're so dead, man.
[346:20.04]Oh, come on!
[346:20.86]Dude, where- I- I ca- I just can't see!
[346:47.10]Gamer fatigue, it's over.
[346:56.31]It's over.
[347:00.33]If we lose, it's over.
[347:00.99]It's over.
[347:03.68]It's over.
[347:04.14]It was over when it began!
[347:05.12]It was over when they were on a fucking vent call!
[347:38.18]Alright, one more and then I'm gonna go buy stuff.
[347:51.37]You almost lost a 4v3.
[348:05.47]The word you're looking for there is almost.
[348:15.20]Okay.
[348:25.85]I'm going to put my pants on for this one.
[349:01.84]Oh, I thought I was going to sneak behind and get everybody.
[349:03.52]That would've been insane.
[349:09.93]Sometimes he says something that bypasses his brain.
[349:11.92]What do you mean?
[349:38.37]Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive, stay alive, stay alive!
[349:40.80]Oh, this is bad.
[349:49.52]Come on, come on, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me!
[350:08.85]Hey!
[350:16.90]Did I explode in the mech?
[350:47.65]Oh, where'd you even come from?
[350:49.78]HACKER!
[350:50.20]I'm sorry, I keep screaming into the mic.
[351:28.79]Come here, you little shit!
[351:30.29]Packer!
[352:02.35]You booyah back?
[352:03.17]Oh.
[352:06.41]No, it wasn't a hacker.
[352:07.11]I'm just kidding.
[352:07.59]I just got angry at the video game and I decided to call.
[352:11.01]Just yell out something.
[352:14.54]Oh, I got a license.
[352:15.24]Okay.
[352:15.34]Alright, I'm gonna buy clothes.
[352:23.20]Let's head back to the clothing shop.
[352:25.64]I wanna see what's here.
[352:28.44]And then I'm gonna do one more game.
[352:31.87]I'll do the gumball machine, I'll do this, I'll do one more game, then I'm gonna end the stream.
[352:36.18]It's a good time to end it.
[352:43.84]It's the same clothes as before.
[352:44.76]Is shoes different?
[352:47.66]No.
[352:53.80]Cool.
[353:17.30]How do I get to my locker?
[353:18.12]In the lobby, right?
[353:32.95]Does this work?
[353:33.43]5,000.
[353:35.99]It's a cool 30,000.
[353:36.91]What?
[353:37.47]Are you kidding me?
[353:54.63]Where's my... Where's my locker?
[354:00.72]In here?
[354:02.50]Where's the locker room?
[354:05.37]Oh, right here.
[354:32.61]What the fuck just happened?
[355:04.55]It cancels literally everything if you press B.
[356:20.35]Minimalist style.
[356:28.25]Alright, last one.
[356:31.32]This is the last one and then I'm done.
[356:35.12]And I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[356:56.33]Yeah, we'll do.
[356:57.87]I know I'm supposed to play Breath of the Wild today, but I didn't.
[357:00.83]We'll do a full Breath of the Wild stream on Sunday.
[357:03.41]But when you're having fun, you don't want to get up.
[357:10.08]Right?
[357:10.98]Having a good time.
[357:11.46]Might as well just keep playing.
[357:20.06]Oh, this is a lot of water.
[357:21.98]Oh, this is a lot of water.
[357:40.57]I forgot to hit the jump button.
[357:49.52]No, I...
[358:26.88]Here we go!
[359:19.56]Holy shit!
[359:50.03]Boom!
[360:23.57]This kid got this game for their birthday, dude.
[360:25.61]What the fuck?
[360:32.89]So did I. Alright, that's a good one to go out on.
[360:47.75]That's a good one to go out on.
[360:48.57]They weren't, look, the teams weren't that bad.
[360:50.49]600, 572.
[360:57.85]This game's great.
[360:59.31]I highly recommend it.
[361:00.19]Very fun.
[361:01.43]Very fun.
[361:04.31]And that's it.
[361:04.77]I'll see you later.
[361:05.47]See you on Sunday.
[361:11.94]I'll see you later, guys.
[361:15.34]Sunday we're going to do Breath of the Wild.
[361:18.96]We might finish it out with some Splatoon 3.
[361:21.44]It's possible.
[361:25.90]You never know.
[361:38.47]I'm very surprised, I will tell you, for real.
[361:41.19]I did not think I was going to like this game at all.
[361:42.81]I thought it was going to be kind of fun, but then, eh.
[361:50.43]It was really fun.
[361:59.14]Breath of the Wild should be fun, too.
[362:00.30]I'm looking forward to it.
[362:08.38]Dude, these Nintendo games have been on point.
[362:11.88]Haven't had a complaint so far.
[362:27.45]If I do that salmon run thing again, I definitely want to do it with other people.
[362:33.73]Those later levels, you 100% need communication.
[362:42.42]Somebody's got eyes on something at some point during the entire game.
[362:47.53]You need that.
[362:53.21]Skill issue?
[362:53.91]Yeah.
[362:54.21]Well, if I play with three other people or two or three other people, then there won't be a skill issue.
[362:57.62]We'll have communication.
[362:58.42]That's a skill.
[363:09.37]I'll see you later, guys.
[363:11.69]Have a good rest of your night.
[363:12.49]Have a good weekend.
[363:13.09]See you on Sunday.
[363:17.58]Call your mother.
[363:24.64]See you later.
[363:43.12]you
[364:17.98]you
[364:52.86]you
