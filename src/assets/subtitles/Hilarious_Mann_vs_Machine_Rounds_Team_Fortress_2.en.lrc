[00:00.56]the engineer, kind of, from slowing down.
[00:02.16]Alright, let's, let's get, let's get, like, two people on the left, two people on the right, because if we're all just, like, firing at the same thing, we'll just die.
[00:09.89]Ah, get it.
[00:10.31]Let's go, let's do it.
[00:15.29]Oh my gosh, I've already lost a full load of health.
[00:18.07]Yeah, I'm already dead.
[00:21.11]He's gonna get money!
[00:24.69]I forgot all about that.
[00:25.71]Oh, this is over.
[00:27.37]We're not even gonna get past the first wave.
[00:30.32]We're all just so slow.
[00:32.98]We're gonna get like a D-.
[00:34.52]Oh my goodness.
[00:36.88]I have to get the money somehow.
[00:41.77]We're not even like 10% of the way.
[00:45.39]Oh my goodness, so many soldiers.
[00:47.17]I'm slowing.
[00:50.43]So much money over there.
[00:51.53]Alright, I'm dead.
[00:53.42]Alright, I'm going in.
[00:55.52]Oh my good gravy.
[00:57.54]I need to eat a sandwich, be right back.
[01:04.19]Potential change of plans here.
[01:06.15]There is no way we're going to get past seven waves like this.
[01:09.42]We may want to change to all scalp.
[01:10.40]That'd be better.
[01:10.88]Because this is just not going to happen.
[01:28.95]We're missing like a hundred dollars right now.
[01:31.45]Oh, no, no.
[01:32.17]No, no, no.
[01:35.01]Just, uh, I don't know.
[01:36.23]I think... We'll be fine.
[01:39.91]Maybe not.
[01:43.84]All NG or all Scout?
[01:46.20]Or all Medic?
[01:49.28]All Medic.
[01:51.68]All Medic might actually work.
[01:53.52]But, who's gonna be doing the damage?
[01:56.78]Dude, needle guns, man.
[01:59.13]Okay, this is where we gotta make some decisions here.
[02:01.23]We need to have a couple of different... Alright, so... How many heal medics do we want?
[02:08.07]Two?
[02:09.17]I'd say probably two.
[02:10.53]Because this is going to be so difficult.
[02:14.57]Oh crap!
[02:15.23]Hey, it started!
[02:16.21]Oh, it started!
[02:17.09]Oh my god!
[02:18.99]What?
[02:20.65]Oh god.
[02:23.74]Get him!
[02:24.50]Get him, Taz!
[02:25.78]Oh my god, okay, there's needle guns not doing damage.
[02:28.48]One more way.
[02:28.96]Why does this guy have crits?
[02:31.17]Why does that guy have 100% crits?
[02:34.95]Why?
[02:35.17]Is that bug?
[02:35.67]Dude, that guy has a legit 100% crits right now.
[02:44.04]Okay, yeah, we're not even hurting them.
[02:45.32]He just got smoked!
[02:48.04]Hold on, that doesn't count.
[02:50.16]That doesn't count.
[02:52.48]Try again.
[03:02.55]that's in camera oh god oh my okay that was that was ridiculous alright we gotta buy things we forgot to buy things yeah I'm going I'm going health on kills we're overdosed we forgot to buy things alright so who who wants to be the first to get the crits
[03:30.96]bro who with with all your gun to give you the press and then somebody else give somebody else the press would be great for some force and stuff yeah that's where they're going to the body system so always credit stories over the same guy I don't want to use it right now but I don't have to follow up on the side by instance that's not me
[03:55.88]This was even worse than I had the idea!
[03:59.94]We don't even do damage!
[04:01.65]This is worse!
[04:05.09]This is like five times worse!
[04:07.95]This was such a bad idea!
[04:12.49]Oh my... Oh my god, we still got this.
[04:16.01]Oh my god, we don't got this.
[04:17.99]Not at all.
[04:20.03]Stay positive.
[04:21.71]I'm doing like five damage a tick.
[04:23.58]Oh.
[04:25.75]Oh, you can't take the needle gun!
[04:27.69]Oh, you probably can.
[04:29.51]Oh my god!
[04:30.85]I can't even, alright.
[04:31.67]Hey, wait, hey, release!
[04:33.55]No, this is bad.
[04:34.37]This is much worse than the heavy attempts.
[04:38.44]This is like, this is like a hundred percent worse.
[04:42.68]Oh my god.
[04:48.20]I love how we can't get past even, like, the first, like, 5%.
[04:50.58]I feel bad for these two guys that are with us right now.
[04:55.79]They're so excited to play, but so upset at what we're doing.
[04:58.91]Oh, and now I'm out of ammo.
[05:03.57]Alright, sorry.
[05:05.66]Change plan.
[05:07.60]Change plan.
[05:09.56]Oh, look at this.
[05:10.30]Just, oh my gosh.
[05:12.86]We're going to have all the dispensers.
[05:14.54]We're going to forget which sentry is ours.
[05:17.76]Honestly, I don't even know.
[05:20.18]I don't even know what sentry is mine.
[05:21.95]Mine's the middle one between these two.
[05:28.57]Everybody on the roof.
[05:32.61]Oh, my God.
[05:36.01]Well, then.
[05:37.11]I think all the space... Wait, wait.
[05:39.32]There we go.
[05:40.85]This is, this is, this is so ugly.
[05:44.95]Like, it's so, like, weird.
[05:46.13]It's just like, meh.
[05:47.81]I feel almost a little claustrophobic.
[05:49.55]Yeah, I know, seriously.
[05:51.65]Alright, uh, shall we?
[05:54.61]Yeah, I guess so.
[05:56.35]I can't even see.
[05:58.05]I have to crouch down and look between two to see where I'm going.
[06:00.65]Because I like the red.
[06:03.79]Oh, poop.
[06:05.80]Dude, alright, somebody, alright, try to find out which beam is yours.
[06:08.74]Good luck.
[06:12.42]Alright, this is mine.
[06:16.56]Oh boy.
[06:17.14]Look at how ridiculous that is.
[06:18.70]Look at the blazes.
[06:20.96]Seriously.
[06:21.48]Like a SWAT team dropping in.
[06:23.14]Money.
[06:23.71]We're not gonna get any money.
[06:25.43]We're not gonna get any money.
[06:26.23]That's why this guy ran down here.
[06:28.39]That's why he came down here.
[06:29.35]I got this.
[06:32.33]How did we not think that through?
[06:34.87]No.
[06:36.21]How could we not think that through?
[06:38.11]Sentry Buster.
[06:39.07]Oh god.
[06:39.51]What the hell?
[06:40.71]He's got a bunch of items.
[06:43.51]I'll take it.
[06:46.68]Oh, here goes everything!
[06:47.76]Oh, goodbye!
[06:48.76]Oh my god.
[06:52.70]Whoa.
[06:52.90]I didn't even see the Sentry Buster.
[06:54.06]Whoa, whoa, what's going on?
[06:55.92]It's all three!
[06:57.66]Whoops.
[06:58.08]Okay, then.
[06:58.50]That did not go well.
[07:06.76]What happens if we literally have six sentries right here?
[07:10.56]We wouldn't get any money, it would just... Just make a line?
[07:14.14]Yeah, it'd be terrible.
[07:16.12]Let's do it.
[07:17.76]Make a legit tower defense wall.
[07:22.56]I'll put the baby one here, too.
[07:24.20]Oh, this is gonna be... This is gonna be terrible.
[07:28.18]Oh, no.

[08:07.74]He's got the medics on him.
[08:08.96]Oh look at this, just everything's broken.
[08:11.92]Oh no.
[08:15.23]He's still at full health.
[08:17.65]He's at full health.
[08:19.39]Dude, we didn't kill one person with that sentry wall.
[08:25.28]Did the other ones wall up yet?
[08:27.86]There's one coming towards you!
[08:29.66]Oh, Shibby!
[08:31.22]It's not me, if you see me shoot it.
[08:33.84]It's not me.
[08:34.32]No, no, no.
[08:34.80]It's the Sentry Buster rifle.
[08:36.66]Yeah, I got... I got Sentry Buster backstabbed.
[08:40.57]There's a giant Demoman coming!
[08:44.81]Oh boy.

[09:00.34]No!
[09:03.08]That guy followed me forever.
[09:04.96]Alright, we gotta start focusing that tank.
[09:08.65]Oh, sentries.
[09:09.35]Or, uh, snipers.
[09:10.85]Yep.
[09:13.27]Watch sniper on the right side.
[09:14.27]Sniper on the right side.
[09:15.05]Oh yeah, yeah.
[09:16.67]Sniper on the right side.
[09:22.22]Big soldier's tank.
[09:28.07]A sentry buster going up on the roof of the building right now.
[09:33.31]These guys are taking a lot of damage.
[09:36.04]Jesus.
[09:36.76]These... Soldiers.
[09:38.88]Sponging it all up.
[09:44.18]Nice.

[09:47.54]Oh, they're on the bomb.
[09:51.16]Nice.

[10:04.51]We get time after this, by the way.
[10:06.23]Oh, my own sentry killed me because I was hitting the tank up close.
[10:08.75]I'm an idiot.
[10:10.15]Sure, we're good.
[10:10.67]This thing will go down.
[10:12.40]There we go.
[10:12.92]Oh, I didn't see you at all.
[10:15.62]You gonna get it?
[10:16.06]You might be close.
[10:18.04]Alright, this is a reset.
[10:22.70]Everyone get back up front.
[10:24.52]This is a reset.
[10:25.47]We got 15 seconds.
[10:27.53]Go, go, go.
[10:30.19]Put ammo in your sentries.
[10:31.19]Mine was out.
[10:32.95]Blow up, blow up, blow up.
[10:34.29]Take it, take it.
[10:36.15]Sentry Buster's going to the back for some reason.
[10:38.43]We got a heavy on the top right.
[10:40.99]Where is the bomb?
[10:42.83]I don't know.
[10:45.49]Okay, so this is where we need to be really, really careful.
[10:49.61]Here comes Sentry Buster, get away from me.
[10:55.79]Alright, this is where it gets nuts.
[10:59.05]This is where I get tasty.

[11:17.94]He's gonna go down, good, good, good.
[11:19.20]Nice.
[11:21.28]Focus on the other one.
