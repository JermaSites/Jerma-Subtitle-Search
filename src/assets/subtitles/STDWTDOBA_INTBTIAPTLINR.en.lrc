[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.97]He's on time.
[00:01.85]I am on time.
[00:02.59]I made it.
[00:05.01]I'm here.
[00:09.46]And I got the tweet out, too.
[00:14.00]Seconds to spare.
[00:14.70]Yeah, well, I started at 12.59.
[00:19.54]But it takes two, three minutes for it to process through the internet and then go through your screen and then get to your computer.
[00:26.66]Why are my lights not on?
[00:30.14]My lights aren't even turned on.
[00:32.59]What's up with this?
[00:38.81]Hold on.
[00:43.91]Yeah, I have one of those, like, click-click lights.
[00:48.04]Hey!
[00:50.78]There we go, now I can see.
[00:57.85]Is this title too much?
[00:59.27]I think it is.
[01:01.83]I kind of have to change this title.
[01:07.75]The title is hurting me?
[01:10.08]Well, there's a reason why I made the title the way it is.
[01:13.30]Today, we're going to play... Well, first of all, let's... Going right to business, let's talk about what's going on.
[01:19.02]Hey!
[01:19.28]How have you been?
[01:21.58]It's been a few days.
[01:22.38]I don't want to get right to business.
[01:28.55]We actually got a couple things to talk about.
[01:29.93]Maybe one thing.
[01:32.61]It's hard to talk remotely seriously when this is on my screen.
[01:41.27]I'm sitting here like, hey, let's talk about some serious stuff.
[01:43.36]There's like a fucking pancake blueberry guy dancing on the screen.
[01:46.26]How can I be serious?
[01:49.28]That's what I have to look at.
[01:54.42]The title of this game...
[01:57.90]is sometimes to deal with the difficulty of being alive, I need to believe there's a possibility that life isn't real.
[02:03.66]That's the name of this game.
[02:12.27]I would have abbreviated this.
[02:15.39]You know?
[02:16.03]I don't think this even fits on Steam.
[02:18.21]Does this dot dot dot at the end on Steam?
[02:23.13]You thought this was a joke.
[02:25.20]No, no, this is real.
[02:27.75]Those of you that don't know, typically maybe 30, 40 minutes before a stream starts, I get in the chat and we just talk.
[02:34.35]You know, we go over lottery numbers.
[02:36.51]We go over our favorite animals.
[02:39.15]And then sometimes we talk about the game that's going to be played in the next 30, 40 minutes.
[02:43.57]So I did a poll, a couple of polls.
[02:44.89]Usually I'd throw it up there.
[02:46.39]If I have like something I like to do or something that I want to do.
[02:50.77]And everyone thought that this was fake.
[02:52.83]That I was just putting this up here to be like a weirdo.
[02:54.98]No.
[02:55.94]No.
[02:57.59]This is an existential game.
[02:59.05]There's no end.
[02:59.75]There's no beginning.
[03:01.55]You just play it.
[03:04.26]I don't know.
[03:05.46]This could be fun.
[03:06.58]Somebody requested this.
[03:08.62]And I tell you, I take requests dead seriously.
[03:12.50]That recommendation channel... If you have a recommendation, put it there.
[03:17.60]I look at it all the damn time.
[03:21.50]I am absolutely serious.
[03:24.66]If you don't think... Oh, no, I'm not gonna recommend that.
[03:27.00]There's no way he'll fucking play it, right?
[03:29.48]No, there's no way.
[03:30.98]If I put something in that channel, is it possible that he might just, like, glaze over it and not care and... No, I think I'm good.
[03:41.43]I don't think he'll play that.
[03:43.43]I don't think he ever would.
[03:49.26]Don't worry.
[03:50.80]If you got something interesting, put it in that channel.
[03:53.96]I'm all about the interesting things.
[03:54.98]Why is there no audio?
[03:57.36]Oh, that's why.
[03:58.96]Because there's music here, isn't there?
[04:04.47]Yes, there is.
[04:12.63]Well, now that makes more sense of why the sprinkle bread guy is dancing.
[04:21.32]How long do you think I can stay on this screen for?
[04:25.87]This is a starting soon screen.
[04:29.58]It just is.
[04:31.58]Hold on.
[04:35.68]Like, oh, that's Jerva.
[04:36.69]It's starting soon.
[04:38.89]I need to see.
[04:52.59]Okay, we're gonna make that... Let's do... Orange or something.
[05:00.04]Alright, here we go.
[05:00.54]Guys, hey, I'll be... Let's turn the stream on.
[05:03.64]I'm starting the stream right now.
[05:34.67]Okay, okay.
[05:35.60]Oh, hey, hey, what's going on guys?
[05:37.20]Hope you had a good day today.
[05:43.08]Me, Jeremy.
[05:43.92]Nice to see you.
[05:46.78]Happy birthday.
[05:47.92]To all of you birthday people out there today.
[05:55.87]I've been playing, sometimes there's a possibility that life and death are the same thing, and it's not even real in the first place, and there's a possibility that I never found it to begin with.
[06:05.67]That's the name of the game we're playing.
[06:08.35]Let's go.
[06:08.61]Alright, how do I go like this?
[06:15.03]Hey!
[06:18.13]Hey buddy, I'm going on vacation tomorrow for my birthday.
[06:20.07]I told you, happy birthday!
[06:23.41]Awesome, happy birthday, awesome.
[06:26.68]Alright, there is no beginning and no end to this game.
[06:29.16]I'm just gonna go.
[06:39.48]I don't- am I even gonna get told how to control the game?
[06:42.81]I have a traffic light on my back.
[06:43.99]There's a punch.
[06:47.07]Uh, okay.
[06:58.27]Should I examine the things over here?
[07:03.52]Oh, there's a spring.
[07:07.90]Alright, so if I was making a video right now, okay, you ready?
[07:11.12]Those of you that are like, oh, remember when he used to make videos?
[07:15.38]What I would do here is after about a minute or so, like, what just happened right there?
[07:19.51]Like, oh, how do I play this?
[07:20.55]Left click?
[07:21.29]Right click?
[07:21.69]Oh, I don't know.
[07:23.34]There would be a cut right here, and it would cut to police sirens and wanted stars in the top right, and I'd be running around, like, punching and screaming and stuff.
[07:31.38]That would be, like, the joke for this part.
[07:32.56]I mean, that's what I would do.
[07:39.03]I'm not even ten seconds into the game, and I know that's what I would do.
[07:48.01]Is this an NPC?
[07:48.91]I want to chat.
[07:51.69]Uh...
[07:55.66]I thought he was grabbing me.
[07:58.20]I thought he was grabbing me.
[08:02.14]One star.
[08:05.26]I don't think I want to do this.
[08:10.20]I'm busy.
[08:10.68]Can't talk now.
[08:14.64]I don't like this.
[08:15.31]I don't like what's going on here.
[08:26.67]Player 1, hey, you're so dumb you think I'm a computer.
[08:28.85]Obviously I'm not.
[08:35.02]Who's running around in the back?
[08:36.18]Who are these people in the background?
[08:39.46]What?
[08:39.94]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[08:40.76]What's going on in the background?
[08:41.94]That's important.
[08:42.68]There's like a half house there.
[08:44.30]Where are you from?
[08:46.02]I'm never going to tell anybody where you're from online.
[08:51.32]What?
[08:51.84]What?
[08:54.43]What are you doing?
[08:54.81]I was gonna write, like, Ohio.
[08:56.57]Did you just converse with a human?
[09:00.31]That was a machine.
[09:02.12]Plus one, yes.
[09:04.88]Hold on, what?
[09:09.64]Oh, it's people!
[09:11.10]There are people?
[09:13.31]There are no people in this game.
[09:29.89]What do I have to do?
[09:30.63]What happened?
[09:31.31]Did it break?
[09:36.45]Uh oh, I just lost my HUD.
[09:40.83]Is this part of like the existential part of the game?
[09:59.87]Sometimes to understand the actuality of the universe, you have to fucking combine two or three atoms in the root of all square roots.
[10:07.43]I'm coming back.
[10:07.97]Hold on.
[10:24.58]Oh, come on.
[10:26.08]Come on.
[10:42.33]I still think it's funny, and that's all I care about.
[10:44.31]I think that's funny.
[10:47.05]Some of you... comedy fuckin'... scholars, maybe, I think that's funny.
[10:54.72]Alright, single player, what the fuck's happening?
[11:04.83]How do I get out of this place?
[11:05.91]I just wanna play the game.
[11:14.06]Okay, that's clearly not a robot.
[11:15.96]I don't think this is a robot.
[11:18.64]How do I talk to this person?
[11:23.47]Go away, I'm swimming.
[11:25.25]I want to talk to you.
[11:26.91]Come here.
[11:28.27]Go away, this is not my head.
[11:30.63]Oh.
[11:32.05]Go away, I'm picking up items.
[11:33.97]This is not, what do you mean picking up items?
[11:39.04]Two, did I get two items?
[11:44.74]Press E to interact.
[11:48.64]Is this guy from Pee Wee Herman?
[11:49.72]An artist was secretly hired by the Bolsheviks when he was 14 to try and ruin Western culture.
[11:55.42]He becomes an egomaniacal misogynist who hides gold bars under his bed.
[12:00.04]Everyone loves him and admires him.
[12:01.96]Institutions teach children to be like him.
[12:09.08]Um, that's a little too deep for Pee Wee Herman.
[12:11.20]Can you just say the word of the day?
[12:12.54]It's like sofa.
[12:17.81]Would you like to play pizza in the woods?
[12:19.71]No.
[12:20.89]Wait.
[12:21.05]Should I have said yes?
[12:22.13]Somebody's just lying on the ground.
[12:31.86]Ooh, I got something.
[12:34.46]Turning on radio.
[12:47.86]Is this a real song?
[12:50.44]No, no, no.
[12:51.28]Is this a real song?
[12:52.62]No, of course it is.
[12:54.08]No, you just... Okay, go away.
[12:55.84]I'm in a conversation.
[12:57.14]Holy shit.
[13:00.76]Is this music?
[13:01.35]Is this music?
[13:02.07]Bruh.
[13:12.41]Oh, what a sick computer system.
[13:13.63]Look at that.
[13:14.01]That person is all over the place.
[13:15.48]That's fucking Bitcoin.
[13:16.44]That's fucking Ethereum.
[13:18.88]That's gold, silver, platinum.
[13:21.14]That's all.
[13:24.95]Except if it was gold, it would be pretty high.
[13:29.01]I just- I wanna go near the song.
[13:31.21]I feel like this is- you put on headphones and you walk around and press the buttons at the museum.
[13:34.48]Now stop playing music!
[14:02.07]fucking battle royale game all we need is the guy that crawls around the three people that crawl around prone and then the one guy that punches everybody in the face like over and over again alright I'm talking to you come here I feel like I've done this move before on camera I have I've done that exact fucking move you've seen it like a thousand times
[14:34.43]Alright, I'm going to go play the pizza one.
[14:38.09]How do we do anything?
[14:39.71]I thought I was supposed to be able to... Okay, here we go.
[14:50.24]Hey.
[14:50.80]Where are you from?
[14:51.68]I'm from Ohio.
[14:55.94]I hate my job.
[14:58.75]I'm sorry.
[15:00.15]Um...
[15:05.72]I'm sorry.
[15:07.16]Uh, that was, that was a, that was a machine.
[15:11.46]Yeah.
[15:11.74]Okay.
[15:12.10]We win.
[15:12.59]Alright, let's go play the pizza game.
[15:23.28]What am I gaining here?
[15:24.44]I'm gaining some kind of weird currency.
[15:31.62]Pizza in the Woods, a walking simulator.
[15:33.16]Leave idle and Pizza will walk and fly by himself.
[15:35.88]Or explore on your own with WASD in the mouse.
[15:37.68]There are things to see in four corners of the forest and a lake to swim in.
[15:40.66]Hit escape to return to Polly's pond.
[15:45.24]I feel like that's one nobody wants to do on his own.
[15:54.31]Alright, so I'm just watching this with you guys.
[15:56.27]We're watching the same thing.
[16:02.18]There's nothing more hilarious than an urgent care waiting room.
[16:04.61]What the fuck is going on?
[16:16.55]This is what happens when you take a dose higher than you're supposed to take of acid.
[16:38.78]don't take more than like you don't first of all just don't do it like if that's not I'm not going to condone any of that but like don't take this don't take drugs ever and don't take too many of them because they end up like writing a sentence and like that I see that person in the corner with their eyes wide open saying all these things don't just don't do drugs they're not good for you I mean they take like tylenol like if you've got a headache take tylenol
[17:03.94]Aspirin.
[17:04.28]But I did just say the thing that the museum button press thing just told you not to do.
[17:13.10]It's documented evidence of why things like marijuana are beneficial to the human body taken in the right way.
[17:20.00]It's good for pain relief and especially for irritable bowel disease as well.
[17:27.68]Just want to make sure everyone's aware of that.
[17:29.14]But be careful when you do drugs today.
[17:31.74]If you don't do them, just don't do them.
[17:39.74]control again.
[17:40.47]I have no more control of pizza, like, pizza Paul, whatever his name is.
[17:51.45]What am I throwing?
[17:55.96]Are those jacks?
[18:11.37]If you can just do something different than your parents, it is a major accomplishment.
[18:17.77]These are just acid fortune cookies.
[18:20.02]Uh-oh, something's going on here.
[18:31.33]Why is this getting so laggy?
[18:45.75]Alright, what is laptop lap dance?
[18:48.12]Return to main level.
[18:49.52]How do I teleport?
[18:52.94]Return to main level.
[18:54.81]Should I find something in here?
[18:55.95]There's probably something in here to do.
[19:01.89]Hey, you want to ditch the stream and light up.
[19:09.25]No, I can't, man.
[19:10.46]I can't.
[19:11.40]I can't.
[19:11.96]Alright, alright.
[19:15.68]I can't, man.
[19:17.46]What is this?
[19:24.94]Should I go to find the laptop?
[19:26.81]There's like two... There's rockets and stuff apparently out here.
[19:29.95]There's things to see in the corners.
[19:31.07]There we go.
[19:31.51]I found... I found it.
[19:34.49]I found the portal.
[19:36.32]I can't wait until the WoW development team... I know I make a WoW reference every single stream, but I have to.
[19:43.35]That's the portal, that's the original portal in, what was the name of the zone?
[19:47.75]For the Emerald Nightmare, the Emerald Dream.
[19:50.55]That was the Emerald Dream portal and it was right behind a dragon.
[19:53.49]There were four dragons in the world, what was its name?
[19:56.92]Duskwood, right?
[19:58.58]That portal, that was behind... What was the dragon's name?
[20:04.20]It was in there for like eight years.
[20:07.83]I'm not telling a joke, I'm giving a wild reference.
[20:15.92]What is this?
[20:16.30]A toilet?
[20:17.88]Alright.
[20:19.14]This is gonna be... Um...
[21:05.06]How many more times am I gonna do it?
[21:10.32]Is it- is it- is it naked?
[21:11.96]What?
[21:16.38]Holy shit, what is that?
[21:22.81]Well, this looks different.
[21:29.37]Is that pencil?
[21:31.47]Whoa!
[21:32.39]Is it an actual pencil NPC?
[21:35.45]How do you talk to the pencil?
[21:38.45]Holy shit, dude.
[21:39.41]Dusk wood.
[21:44.38]Okay, this is somebody's house.
[21:51.05]I don't like this.
[21:51.53]I want to go through this quickly.
[21:52.51]I don't like this tunnel.
[22:02.32]What am I doing?
[22:04.76]What's going on?
[22:05.34]Why am I sitting?
[22:05.90]What do you mean you can't believe that?
[22:15.03]That sounds awesome.
[22:18.58]That's not...
[22:37.98]No, I get... You guys thought this was going to be like a meme?
[22:43.03]No, this is like an existential fucking serious game.
[22:51.87]Why is it dark?
[22:53.77]I kind of want to get away from the pizza place.
[22:57.06]I want to get out of the pizza place.
[23:05.42]This game is freaking me out.
[23:08.38]A fox and a cricket develop a deep friendship in the Buruburu forest, but the humans are encroaching with their subdivisions and shopping malls.
[23:16.07]The fox and the cricket organize all the animals in the forest, and they commit group suicide.
[23:20.45]Alright, so, um... So... Jesus Christ!
[23:32.79]Um...
[23:39.73]Can I do the broke fog test again?
[23:41.41]Run.
[23:46.47]I'm going up here.
[23:47.11]Is there anywhere else I can go?
[23:48.37]To bed?
[23:53.44]Painting?
[23:59.06]I can't like hold down and go like...
[24:10.92]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[24:11.58]Something going on over here.
[24:18.79]There's a Guitar Hero controller.
[24:23.13]Why isn't there sound?
[24:31.46]Give me some music!
[24:44.97]to do it I don't want to do it I don't want to do it I have to help
[25:09.70]Stop.
[25:11.86]I can't stop.
[25:12.74]I need to do it.
[25:18.32]It's all I care about.
[25:19.88]I don't care about anything else.
[25:23.16]I'm losing my mind right now.
[25:25.00]Wait, wait, wait, just wait.
[25:29.00]Just wait, wait.
[25:31.01]Okay.
[26:00.42]I'm sorry.
[26:01.14]I'm really sorry.
[26:01.94]People are probably fucking pissed.
[26:04.18]I can't help it.
[26:04.78]Okay.
[26:13.69]What else can I do?
[26:14.37]That's the only thing I've been able to do in this game is just zoom in on people doing that dance.
[26:19.95]I really should be paying attention to the message that the game is trying to convey, right?
[26:23.39]Like, the messages and the things that you should be thinking about.
[26:26.05]Ugh.
[26:28.63]Alright, I think... What the fuck was that?
[26:35.86]Somebody's driving by really fast in a car with their windows down.
[26:40.48]You know, I love... Anytime that happens, I laugh my ass off.
[26:43.42]When you get this, like... Hold on, it's coming from over here?
[26:48.73]Like, you're at a red light, and somebody pulls up next to you, and you hear it.
[26:53.98]You're talking to, like, your mother in the front seat.
[26:55.54]Like, oh, yeah, I really do think that it's... Yeah, I think that the best part about, um... Uh, yeah.
[27:04.34]No, no, yeah, we'll get milk, too.
[27:08.84]They fucking take that.
[27:13.14]You gotta get that windows down.
[27:14.28]You got your windows down.
[27:15.30]Is anybody gonna roll them up?
[27:17.89]No, the person's gonna be like, just get fucking rolling those windows up, you don't like my music?
[27:27.88]Topical stand-up.
[27:29.63]You know when you're pulling up at a red light?
[27:40.85]So I did say that this is going to be either... I did say.
[27:42.99]I made it very clear.
[27:45.35]That we were going to either play this for 30 minutes or 2 hours.
[27:47.65]And it's been 30.
[27:48.13]It's been 30 minutes.
[27:50.11]What was that?
[27:51.67]Is it Stack City?
[27:54.41]Yeah!
[27:58.76]Uh... Pep.
[28:09.87]Should I read this?
[28:10.91]I'm not going to read this.
[28:16.78]Should I read this whole thing?
[28:20.04]It's too many.
[28:20.52]That's too many words, I think.
[28:30.78]Picture a dark room in your head.
[28:32.14]It's night.
[28:32.80]Maybe just a little bit of moonlight is creeping in through a window.
[28:35.17]So you can just make out some of the silhouettes of some objects.
[28:38.69]The pictures on the wall are black.
[28:40.37]The couch is black.
[28:41.11]The table is black.
[28:41.83]The lamp over the couch is black.
[28:43.36]The air is dark blue.
[28:45.66]Take out the ceiling.
[28:47.28]Look at the room from above.
[28:49.26]All you see is blue and black.
[28:50.48]Now turn on a lamp in the room.
[28:52.53]Okay, let's...
[29:28.52]Now there's a light in your head.
[29:33.02]How do I move?
[29:35.72]That's one of the best shows of all time, by the way.
[29:37.16]Curb Your Enthusiasm is one of the best fucking comedic actors.
[29:39.56]Some of the best comedy.
[29:41.10]Just true, quick-witted, fucking real comedians.
[29:44.00]Not me.
[29:45.76]Bart Simpson.
[29:47.56]No, no, no.
[29:48.00]Bart Simpson's not part of that group.
[29:49.60]I just saw that and had to say it.
[29:50.64]And I think that's Bart Simpson.
[29:57.30]What do I press?
[29:58.22]No, no, no, no.
[30:01.00]This is another one of these.
[30:02.32]Oh, wait, wait, wait, here we go.
[30:03.40]This is creepy.
[30:13.65]I had somebody wash my face with rose water.
[30:17.89]I remember looking at ChromeJump X from my bedroom window, but I don't think I could actually see it.
[30:25.31]Okay, well, what else is going on here?
[30:34.10]I don't want to think about that.
[30:35.22]I really don't want to think about that.
[30:36.38]I'm not sure I want to.
[30:38.74]I don't want to look at that.
[30:41.44]I don't want to look at this one either.
[30:48.19]I'm not going to do it.
[31:08.34]I need to fix it.
[31:09.12]It's wrong.
[31:33.91]One of these times I'm going to do this, and I'm actually just going to get up and fucking leave for like five minutes.
[31:38.91]I will drop a thousand viewers, but like, I don't know, it might be worth it.
[31:49.78]It's done.
[31:52.74]That's like an emote.
[32:25.90]That's the emote I would expect to, like, have, like, react to this.
[32:29.28]Like a, whoa, what the fuck?
[32:31.73]That's fucking pretty.
[32:33.11]Uh-oh.
[32:34.09]We got some overlap here.
[32:49.47]Let's get to the top.
[32:51.56]In the shower, my girlfriend.
[32:53.66]From a young age, William Blake.
[32:55.72]I don't, this is freaking me out.
[33:01.07]I don't like this.
[33:02.67]And maybe it's, maybe that's by design.
[33:16.60]Holy shit.
[33:17.24]That's a good point.
[33:18.17]That's a great point.
[33:48.79]What will they do?
[33:49.43]What the hell's gonna happen?
[34:00.95]I think the five-point narrative structure is Rance Corp's home living with The Sopranos.
[34:05.12]Lately, when I put on a movie or TV show, I get so bored and barely pay attention.
[34:08.84]I browse the web and send messages.
[34:10.32]I just want bright, warm lights on all around me.
[34:12.79]Things to glance at and be reminded I'm not alone in the universe.
[34:16.01]I don't know, five-point structure is... I mean, that's... The Sopranos is one of the best TV shows ever made, right?
[34:34.00]I mean, I want your character creator.
[34:36.98]Because I definitely would make something like this in the Jerma record.
[34:41.00]I would love this creator.
[34:43.89]Give me one of these, WWE.
[34:48.82]I love the idea of a tulpa, a spiritual being you make with your focused mind that acts independently from you.
[34:54.90]I'm always having dreams where I interact with people I've never seen in waking life.
[34:57.78]That's true, happens to me too.
[34:59.21]I've fallen in love and grown very angry with people that don't exist.
[35:02.79]I probably have a lot of tulpas in me I could create if I ever really concentrate.
[35:06.51]Our capacity for creating analogical spaces could be the greatest thing about us or make us the shortest surviving of all the species.
[35:15.20]Dude, I... I'm telling you, I've had dreams before where, like, I had this... It's like me and my dad in our house.
[35:24.96]But it's just some bald guy with a mustache.
[35:27.76]My dad does not have a mustache.
[35:29.49]He's not bald.
[35:33.37]I am of, like, Irish and Polish descent.
[35:38.15]And, like, this guy in my dreams, he's in, like, a few of them, is, like, an Italian guy.
[35:43.10]He's, like, an Italian guy with a mustache.
[35:44.84]He's not my dad.
[35:50.08]So, I don't know.
[35:50.90]I have no idea why does that happen.
[35:59.08]It's not Mario.
[36:00.96]Oh, you guys, it's not fucking Mario.
[36:06.50]It's just... It is what it just is.
[36:12.42]I've played too many video games, and fucking Mario has been burned in my brain.
[36:17.28]It's like, Dad, that's also kind of messed up, and maybe that's... What's going on?
[36:29.06]I want to keep- what's going on?
[36:30.04]Trees, trees, gathering, gathering, humans, one human at Polar Pond.
[36:35.64]So?
[36:36.44]What the fuck?
[36:44.35]Oh, I forgot to tell you guys this story.
[36:45.47]It's about sleeping.
[36:46.61]This is important.
[36:47.07]This has nothing to do with anything going on on the screen.
[36:48.69]Nothing at all.
[36:49.71]So, um... Every so often I tell you guys a story about, like, Kim and I with some, like, weird shit happens when we're in the same... We're sleeping in the same room.
[36:58.82]Sometimes, like...
[37:00.52]She'll have a dream or I'll have like a dream or it's just something funny will happen so Why you resin sleepery?
[37:08.42]I mean this this is fucking fun This is a funny story, and I'm gonna tell it and I don't even care if you think it's a boring story I thought it was funny and that's what we do on this stream We talk about funny things that happen in my what a crazy fucking life right what a wild life I have right
[37:24.59]Listen to me, alright.
[37:25.67]So Kim gets up sometimes in the middle of the night and goes to the bathroom.
[37:29.57]I do it too.
[37:30.73]But I was dead asleep.
[37:32.23]I'm lying on my back and I'm dead asleep and I heard her start to move around and start to Ster, if you will, right?
[37:38.47]So she kind of turns and she sits on the edge of the bed and that's when I started to wake up.
[37:43.53]And I didn't know, I didn't see what she was doing.
[37:45.69]I'm looking at her back, right?
[37:46.91]So her back and the back of her head.
[37:48.61]So she's sitting on the edge of the bed, and she leans forward, and this is the first thing, remember my eyes just opened, I see this.
[37:55.68]I hear, and she leaned forward, I thought she shit diarrhea in her pants.
[38:03.18]Just like leaning forward, just shitting her pants.
[38:06.94]But she was blowing her nose.
[38:09.06]But in my, I just barely got out of sleep, in my, I'm, I just am becoming conscious.
[38:16.74]I was just like, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
[38:18.52]ARE YOU OKAY?
[38:20.70]He's like, why would anybody sit up on the edge of a bed, lean forward, and just, like... Fucking... You don't... What?
[38:31.31]I really thought it happened.
[38:33.33]It was a huge nose blow.
[38:38.48]That's a funny story!
[38:39.56]That's a funny, like, be my girlfriend, you know, like, funny thing.
[38:45.17]Why is that the story?
[38:46.25]Because we're talking about sleep and dreams and stuff.
[38:51.85]What?
[38:54.75]You don't- that's- you don't think that that's like a humorous story?
[38:57.89]That's not even a boomer story.
[38:59.47]That wasn't a boomer story.
[39:14.18]I thought it was really funny.
[39:15.34]Oh, we have something else.
[39:17.32]What?
[39:17.42]I don't want to listen to that.
[39:18.74]Turn that light off.
[39:19.42]Cut to power.
[39:19.80]Can I get up there?
[39:44.37]Wait.
[39:45.61]Would you like to play the Founders now?
[39:47.44]Oh god, I don't know.
[39:52.71]The central nervous system gives you a version of reality that keeps it comfortable.
[40:00.57]To exist is to have a body.
[40:04.01]To have a body is to have limited understanding.
[40:08.70]Suddenly, you find your consciousness far away from your flesh, and your awareness drifting to wherever it aims.
[40:22.42]Why did somebody say ASMR truck?
[40:28.85]That's not a truck.
[40:34.47]That is not... Actual TOS.
[40:36.33]What?
[40:36.81]What are you talking about?
[40:38.53]What do you mean?
[40:46.21]Turn it off.
[40:46.83]Turn it off.
[40:47.45]Turn it off.
[40:47.99]Turn it off.
[40:48.45]Turn it off.
[40:48.85]What?
[40:49.03]What's going on?
[40:49.57]What's going on?
[40:51.20]A break dancer with ice cream zits.
[40:54.10]An alien reggae band using dismembered chimeras as instruments.
[40:59.52]Everyone is listening to radio stations from across Earth trying to make sense of humanity.
[41:06.63]The more they try to make sense, the less sense there is.
[41:10.41]The founders of Daytona Beach also founded Dayton, Ohio.
[41:15.17]Stock trading through Vedic ritual.
[41:18.07]Decapitated heads telling sci-fi stories to walls.
[41:22.72]A green cowboy stuck inside a wooden temple.
[41:26.22]I don't understand.
[41:28.41]Is it something at the end?
[41:31.57]If you want your body back, you need to pronounce a seven-syllable word three times.
[41:39.21]It is a vibration key to a corporeal ego.
[41:43.69]Figure out your word, pronounce it, and you will return to a body.
[41:48.72]Seven-syllable word.
[41:51.52]Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
[41:53.58]That's like 12, never mind.
[41:54.54]I need a seven-syllable word.
[42:16.00]Thank you.
[42:54.96]No, I'm not going to do it twice.
[42:56.49]Whoa.
[42:57.47]Can you imagine that thing just screaming?
[43:05.28]Everybody always makes these horror game things, and these scary monsters, and they're like, oh my god, look out, it's the lady with the long hair, and the coat on, or whatever.
[43:15.63]No.
[43:16.41]If this thing was sprinting full speed down an alley, screaming, this would be way scarier than the guy from Outlast.
[43:43.94]Say love ain't work
[44:05.31]There's nobody dancing here.
[44:08.59]Is this a band song?
[44:10.15]Alright, if I do that joke again, I want 100 people to unsubscribe.
[44:14.70]Okay.
[44:14.90]If I do that joke one more time, I want 100 people to unsubscribe.
[44:36.77]Ugh!
[44:37.85]Is that a mouth?
[44:38.79]Oh, it's an eye.
[44:39.41]Whatever it is.
[44:39.95]What did I just pick up?
[44:40.61]Do I have to collect all the things?
[44:52.42]Is that going to bite me?
[45:20.38]This is very strange.
[45:22.22]I guess this is weird.
[45:23.38]This is strange.
[45:28.92]Am I not tall enough to go over here?
[45:30.46]What's that?
[45:31.06]R1.
[45:31.14]Do I have to press R1 on the controller?
[45:47.20]Now that's cool.
[45:48.96]I know what that feels like.
[45:50.16]You know when you just look at something, I know it.
[45:51.90]It's like a leather... It's like a nice, smooth, leathery feel.
[45:55.71]I know what that feels like.
[45:56.99]I want that.
[45:57.41]I want to feel that right now.
[45:58.81]I want to, like, raise my hand over that, like, soft, like, very smooth leather.
[46:19.69]Nope.
[46:19.99]I'm not losing 100 subs.
[46:30.95]I got my finger on the unsub button.
[46:37.46]Am I just talking to this thing?

[47:31.67]Do you?
[47:32.13]I don't like this.
[47:33.09]Okay.
[47:35.73]Okay.
[47:37.11]Right.
[47:38.21]That's... Alright.
[47:39.13]That's...
[47:57.75]I don't know what that was.
[47:59.27]I think that was a stomach.
[48:00.65]It was a stomach.
[48:01.25]Something coming out of the stomach.
[48:08.21]There's a monster coming out of somebody's stomach.
[48:23.88]What the fuck?
[48:25.58]No.
[48:26.34]Oh my god.
[48:29.20]Damn it.
[48:31.56]I can't.
[48:34.57]I thought it was like done.
[48:37.07]The thing came out of his stomach.
[48:38.31]This is like it popped out of the stomach and it was out.
[48:40.91]He ate... I'm gonna give you exactly what happened.
[48:44.50]This guy up here helped me out.
[48:45.48]My stomach hurts.
[48:46.16]I went to the fucking... It was rated two and a half stars on Yelp.
[48:49.92]I went anyways.
[48:50.42]I was hungry.
[48:51.28]It was like a restaurant that was really lowly rated.
[48:54.79]But it was like two stars on Yelp, I was hungry, only thing open.
[48:57.19]I went there, I got a fucking, like, triple bean and fish burrito.
[49:00.41]I don't know why I did that, it was just, it was a special, it was $1.40.
[49:04.10]I don't know why, I didn't realize why it was that less expensive, but I ate it anyways, and it was okay going down.
[49:08.88]And then, like, I fucking, my stomach started hurting, and, like, I had a ton of diarrhea problems, and then, like, oh, like an alien bursted out of my stomach, that's what just happened.
[49:15.65]Nothing else happened.
[49:37.89]Get out of here.
[49:38.81]I don't want to have to do... I want to just press this.
[49:42.05]I know if somebody else has streamed this game, that's fine.
[49:44.27]But I run a PGR rated stream.
[49:47.33]Alright, it's gone.
[49:48.25]No, it's not.
[49:48.79]It came out again.
[49:49.99]It did it again.
[49:50.45]Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
[50:14.22]Okay, this is... Well, you have no idea how fucked up this is.
[50:21.14]Okay, I'm out of here.
[50:22.37]I'm leaving.
[50:23.23]I'm out.
[50:29.43]Do I go up here?
[50:30.49]How do I end this?
[50:31.65]I did all the things...
[50:46.14]Wait, go in here?
[50:47.46]Oh.
[50:49.14]Low, low, low, low, low.
[50:53.49]Tee-ree-tee-low.
[50:56.51]Tee-ree-tee-low.
[50:57.79]What is this?
[51:00.42]Ree-tee-low-Ken.
[51:12.22]Am I getting smaller?
[51:13.20]Oh, seven syllables.
[51:15.28]Tee-ree, tee-ree-tee-low-can.
[51:17.68]I need two more.
[51:19.76]Roll writer.
[51:25.48]Okay.
[51:26.59]Tee-ree-tee-low-can-lick.
[51:31.73]Tee-ree-tee-low-can-lick.
[51:33.31]What word is this going to be?
[51:39.91]Where's this final word?
[51:40.79]No?
[51:48.49]Did I not get it?
[51:50.55]No, it's not in there.
[51:56.01]Not around here.
[51:59.80]Seven syllables.
[52:01.98]One more.
[52:02.86]I missed it somewhere.
[52:05.84]Here?
[52:06.10]This didn't do anything.
[52:10.77]Mirror?
[52:12.29]Oh, got it.
[52:13.37]Um, triangle?
[52:16.47]What the hell is that?
[52:19.11]Is it?
[52:19.62]Alright, I really don't, I don't even know where I need to find here.
[52:41.19]One of the sharks?
[52:43.27]I may have missed it way back.
[52:44.95]It's not really something you dance like this to.
[52:53.16]Move out of the way.
[53:10.02]No, I went... I looked at that already.
[53:14.22]I was already up there.
[53:17.37]Where the hell am I missing?
[53:27.01]I would think it would be something like over here, but I already got that one.
[53:29.31]I already got that one.
[53:30.56]I need to at least complete this.
[53:31.70]I have to just get out of this.
[53:36.56]Computer...
[53:44.32]Inside.
[53:44.62]Wait.
[53:46.14]Got it.
[53:48.66]Okay, so I got... Tee-ree.
[53:55.98]Tee-ree.
[53:56.50]Tee-ree-tee-lo.
[53:59.29]Tee-ree-tee-lo-can.
[54:02.73]Tee-ree-tee-lo.
[54:04.45]Tee-ree-tee-ro-lo-can-lecker.
[54:07.61]Tee-ree-tee-lo-can-lecker.
[54:12.53]I did it.
[54:22.98]Oof.
[54:27.06]Am I cursed now forever?
[54:29.27]No, I don't have the forever curse.
[54:31.79]Somebody look that up.
[54:32.35]Does that mean anything?
[54:34.25]Should I not have said that?
[54:36.57]Is that like... He just took my soul.
[54:43.15]Alright, here comes the... That's a person.
[54:54.20]Total, 25.
[54:54.92]Is that a good number to leave?
[54:56.52]Obviously I'm not going to reply because I want you to think I'm a computer.
[55:23.55]I am a... I am fat and don't like the way I look.
[55:31.76]Um, I... Exercise?
[55:34.98]Or... lifestyle change?
[55:38.16]Nope.
[55:39.16]That was a human.
[55:44.02]No, I don't want to play that.
[55:45.04]Is there any other game to play?
[55:49.69]I feel like there's probably only a few more things to see.
[55:58.94]Do the multiplayer.
[56:00.54]No.
[56:01.46]I'm not going to do multiplayer in this game.
[56:08.75]If it even still works.
[56:19.91]Multiplayer in a game like this is probably just like, hey, come on in, anybody, and fucking destroy the stream.
[56:31.99]Yeah, I'm not even going to say that out loud.
[56:33.77]Alright, that was interesting.
[56:34.61]We can play Metal Wolf Panic now.
[56:37.27]That was a nice start.
[56:38.60]Wait, what is this?
