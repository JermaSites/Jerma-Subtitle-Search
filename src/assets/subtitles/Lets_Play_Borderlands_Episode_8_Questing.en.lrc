[00:13.92]Ow, ow.
[00:17.99]There we go.
[00:18.51]You alive?
[00:21.47]Yeah, I'm still, I'm still, I'm cool.
[00:23.59]Oh, here, daytime's coming.
[00:28.75]I need health.
[00:30.20]Your shield is a godsend, honestly.
[00:32.08]Oh yeah, this thing's great.
[00:35.76]So what are we, what are we looking for?
[00:37.93]I don't even know.
[00:38.51]I don't think we've been following the mission.
[00:41.77]Have we not been following the directions for the last, like, twenty minutes?
[00:47.14]It says we gotta go that way.
[00:53.22]But I like this place.
[00:54.42]Yeah, this place is fun.
[00:57.52]I'm going in the tube.
[00:59.19]Look, Mom, I'm going in the tube.
[01:00.99]Oh, I just did some nasty parkour.
[01:06.43]Alright, this thing wants us to go back here.
[01:10.36]Did we already get what we needed to get?
[01:11.84]Yeah, gate switch found.
[01:14.20]We need to find the gate switch.
[01:16.00]Where the hell's the gate switch?
[01:18.86]Oh, health.
[01:19.26]We can heal up here.
[01:25.42]Insta-heal.
[01:30.48]I don't see any gate switches.
[01:34.10]Holy shit!
[01:36.39]Wow.
[01:37.95]I hate, I despise, let me rephrase that, I despise these stupid barrels.
[01:45.12]They killed me in the first three seconds of the video.
[01:50.16]Those things.
[01:51.82]You're going to cost yourself some money if you die.
[01:55.42]Come up here, it looks like these are here for a reason.
[01:57.74]I have one health.
[02:00.58]Oh shit.
[02:03.29]Well, don't do what I did.
[02:04.03]Don't fall down.
[02:04.81]But those look like they're there for a reason.
[02:06.71]Me fall down?
[02:07.47]Ha.
[02:10.26]You're funny.
[02:12.86]You're funny.
[02:14.80]That was particularly... Oh, my God.
[02:17.04]I am a moron.
[02:18.30]I can't get up this last step.
[02:19.70]Oh, shit.
[02:20.12]We have a psycho and a badass rider.
[02:22.28]Alright.
[02:22.48]Wait for me.
[02:22.94]Wait for me.
[02:23.30]Because I am apparently completely and totally stupid when it comes to making this last jump.
[02:30.23]There we go.
[02:32.57]Okay, I'm up here now.
[02:36.15]I'm dying.
[02:36.57]They're coming at me.
[02:40.33]Oh, right in your face.
[02:43.83]Oh my god.
[02:46.25]Dude, I just had full health.
[02:47.76]That guy just hit me once and I'm like dead now.
[02:52.42]Let me take out the psycho guy.
[02:54.02]Oh, sorry.
[02:56.04]Killed that one.
[02:59.06]Oh, I got a critical headshot.
[03:01.70]These guys are on, like, the Gatling guns up there.
[03:04.19]Gatling guns.
[03:06.07]Oh, god.
[03:06.89]Yeah, we gotta get some better ground here.
[03:13.29]Gotta love critical hits.
[03:14.93]Gotta love them.
[03:15.43]Let's be careful.
[03:17.08]There's a guy, I gotta, if I had any rounds in my sniper... Wait, ready?
[03:20.76]Go.
[03:23.02]Go, bird.
[03:29.76]There's a guy up on that ledge.
[03:36.82]I have one health and no shield.
[03:46.99]You alright?
[03:48.81]I'm about to die.
[03:49.77]I'm trying to get the kill on him.
[03:55.67]Yeah, I died.
[03:57.31]Nah, I'm going down.
[04:01.27]Alright, I got second wind.
[04:03.63]My god, there's so many of these guys.
[04:05.65]I'm just hiding in the corner.
[04:10.03]I have one ammo for the thing that's not my shotgun.
[04:13.96]Yeah, I'm coming.
[04:14.46]I just need to switch to my incendiary pistol.
[04:18.36]I'm out of ammo for both my guns.
[04:20.34]Time for the suicide melee.
[04:24.20]I got you.
[04:25.16]I'm completely out of ammo.
[04:34.94]Alright, I'm going back on.
[04:35.84]Here we go.
[04:42.27]Wow, that's a far run.
[04:43.35]Yeah, I'm falling.
[04:55.59]Yeah, this is a far run.
[04:57.03]I'm going to take this.
[04:59.04]Get rid of this guy up on the ledge.
[05:01.52]Take the guy on the left.
[05:02.88]The guy on the ledge is dead.
[05:07.28]Wait, wait.
[05:11.80]Come on.
[05:12.56]Just a little bit more.
[05:13.86]Second life, second life, second life, second life, second life.
[05:16.04]Damn it.
[05:17.80]I was right there.
[05:19.08]I leveled up.
[05:20.77]I leveled up.
[05:22.13]Are you serious?
[05:23.69]Oh, and that cost 32 bucks.
[05:25.09]You know why?
[05:25.55]Because I have 427.
[05:26.37]That's it.
[05:29.21]I have two experience points I could have used.
[05:32.44]Well, here's something funny.
[05:33.82]I have no bullets, so I can't even attempt to shoot the guy that's up on that ledge.
[05:39.81]Come on, give me some ammo.
[05:42.25]There's no ammo here.
[05:43.65]There's no pistol ammo or no sniper rifle ammo.
[05:49.63]Check right here, right here, right here.
[05:50.69]Oh, okay.
[05:54.62]Here's a health vial.
[05:55.52]Thermal shield.
[05:56.30]Oh, is there more guys shooting?
[06:00.94]Yeah, this guy up on the top right, there on that ledge, I don't have any bullets and any guns.
[06:11.03]I don't have... This is all, um... His ass is mine.
[06:16.21]Shit, I don't want to activate these other enemies.
[06:18.33]Oh, shit.
[06:19.71]Oh, not a good idea.
[06:20.51]This is my bird.
[06:21.85]I can just kill him.
[06:23.09]Go get him, bird.
[06:23.98]Get him.
[06:24.34]What are you doing?
[06:26.16]Ow, fuck.
[06:27.42]My bird is an idiot.
[06:30.31]it probably is a range yeah you're right you definitely have other weapons in your inventory though yeah true I'm gonna put on just this random crappy one I just wish somehow I could get up to the guy do I have any
[06:54.55]Just thunder.
[06:57.64]There we go.
[06:59.74]Oh, shit.
[07:00.16]You got a guy down there.
[07:02.84]I'll take him out.
[07:03.98]This is the gun that you had.
[07:06.60]I think we duplicated it by accident.
[07:09.51]Weird.
[07:09.75]Alright.
[07:13.73]Hopefully the bird can kill that guy.
[07:15.35]Alright.
[07:25.46]Screw you, midget.
[07:33.34]Oh, you know what I think this might be?
[07:35.74]This might be a quest item.
[07:37.32]Like, for completing that quest.
[07:39.95]That we both get?
[07:41.01]Yeah, I think I... Because I didn't get the desert.
[07:43.51]I didn't get the desert sniper.
[07:45.07]That's weird.
[07:47.35]Yeah, maybe we did just accidentally, like, duplicate it.
[07:51.09]Because you said you got it too.
[07:52.59]I was like, what?
[07:53.18]No, you didn't.
[07:59.52]Get him, bird.
[08:00.92]Fire!
[08:01.28]Alright, ready?
[08:04.48]Dammit.
[08:04.95]Alright, please tell me that some of this is sniper rifle ammo.
[08:10.41]Okay, at least I can use this gun now.
[08:20.66]Man, these guys don't let up.
[08:26.13]I need his grenade multiple critical shots in the face this guy up top is pissing me off he's up top can you take him out I got them stuck in like a ledge here oh there's a business there's like three or four guys in that house I got a boy
[08:56.75]Okay.
[08:58.77]Did I get any sniper rifle ammo?
[09:07.00]Oh my god, there's like seven or eight guys there now.
[09:16.79]What I want to know is where the guy on the top is.
[09:25.26]Is he still up there?
[09:25.96]I thought he was dead.
[09:28.30]I got him.
[09:33.00]Here, I'm gonna go distract him.
[09:44.08]Oh damn, beautiful.
[09:47.18]Yeah, I got an SMG in my inventory.
[09:49.10]I'm gonna get the guys behind him.
[09:51.91]I just left that guy to die from fire.
[09:55.24]Oh god, that guy's got a powerful weapon.
[09:58.62]Fritz.
[10:01.33]Oh, Jesus.
[10:07.89]Oh, will you die already?
[10:11.91]That was sick looking.
[10:22.24]Just with my last bullet, I got him.
[10:26.34]What I need is SMG ammo.
[10:30.72]Yeah, we need like a town or something.
[10:35.64]There's a lot of stuff back here, it looks like.
[10:38.14]Oh man, there is like... Yeah, come here.
[10:41.67]There's two dumpsters full of stuff.
[10:48.59]No weapons, though.
[10:50.43]Let me see.
[10:50.89]I need to compare this to my other weapon.
[10:54.48]Yep, take your time, dude.
[10:57.89]Well, this one has better accuracy and fire rate, so I'll use this one for now.
[11:03.01]This one's only twice as much damage, no big deal.
[11:07.23]No biggie.
[11:08.05]Oh, you need health.
[11:09.39]That's what you need.
[11:10.31]Oh, yeah.
[11:11.73]I'm in dire... Oh, shit!
[11:13.35]What was that?
[11:14.76]Badass corrosive skag.
[11:16.54]Oh, yeah, watch it.
[11:17.20]He'll jump right up here.
[11:19.50]Throwing my bird down there.
[11:21.22]Whoa, that was a big explosion.
[11:26.95]This guy's got thick skin.
