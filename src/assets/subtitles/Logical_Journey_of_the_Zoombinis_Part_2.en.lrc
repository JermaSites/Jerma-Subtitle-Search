[ve:60.16.100]

[00:40.69]OK, see I'm early.
[00:43.46]I'm early.
[00:48.87]I mean, I said I was going to be much earlier than this, but.
[00:52.41]No, we can get.
[00:55.31]four minutes is fine by the way I looked over here and right when I pressed the go live button I saw somebody say oh like he farted or fart fart or something and I was like oh what because I did right before I pressed the button I was like how is it possible they could know that but I forgot that's like one of your guys favorite words so
[01:17.21]It's like, of course, somebody probably writes the word farts in this chat, like, once every, I mean, it's probably every, like, two or three hundred words.
[01:30.13]So, yeah.
[01:34.06]Didn't catch me.
[01:34.68]Okay, hi.
[01:38.84]How's it going?
[01:39.30]Welcome to the stream.
[01:43.78]Somebody just said, great.
[01:45.07]Yeah, like, okay, great.
[01:49.71]Today, we're going to... Hmm.
[01:52.03]What are we doing today?
[01:54.81]We're playing the logical journey of the Zumbinis.
[02:01.22]I played this game 30 years ago.
[02:06.18]I also played this game about six or seven years ago.
[02:08.58]It's been a long time.
[02:12.04]It has been at least five full years.
[02:16.83]Don't you feel old?
[02:20.16]30 years ago?
[02:20.62]I mean, when did this come out?
[02:24.66]Okay.
[02:25.64]Logical Journey of the Zoombinis.
[02:31.66]This came out in 1996.
[02:32.53]That's 27 years ago.
[02:34.83]Yeah, 30 years ago.
[02:54.11]People were question marking when I said 30 years.
[02:56.53]Hmm.
[02:59.51]Damn, you're old.
[03:00.43]Yeah.
[03:00.73]But we're going to play it.
[03:04.78]We're going to get to my favorite part.
[03:06.70]If you don't know my favorite part, it's the narrator.
[03:09.54]And it's when, you know, for all the new viewers.
[03:15.52]We'll let you experience it on your own here.
[03:18.70]It's a puzzle game for kids.
[03:21.96]I seem to be on a trend here playing puzzle games for children.
[03:26.06]I feel like I do that a lot.
[03:31.28]But yeah, let's go.
[03:36.22]Shame you don't have any brain fluid.
[03:40.28]Wait, was this the brain fluid stream?
[03:50.20]It was!
[03:50.78]Okay, yeah, it was.
[03:52.28]Here comes an embarrassment.
[04:01.15]Well, the thing about the logical journey of the Zoombinis is you can change the difficulty to be as easy or as hard as you want.
[04:11.32]You can make this game impossible.
[04:15.94]You know, when you're in a like a character creator and you can just go to the hands and you can make the hands just scaled 500 times.
[04:22.32]It's like, holy shit, that's kind of ridiculous.
[04:28.58]Zumbinis, you can you can scale the difficulty up almost impossible.
[04:33.99]You'll see.
[04:40.25]So is this like Street Fighter?
[04:46.36]Dude, you're playing a 30 year old game and not Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom.
[04:51.39]Hey.
[04:56.37]I'm the fart simulator guy.
[04:59.59]I'm the fart simulator guy.
[05:00.89]I'm not the Zelda guy.
[05:02.23]You know what I'm saying?
[05:03.41]You gotta do what you know.
[05:14.59]Alright, is Zoombinis...
[05:18.65]Some of the most important media... I'm kidding.
[05:20.87]Alright, let's go.
[05:23.69]Actually, yeah, it kind of is.
[05:25.63]Educational.
[05:29.66]Fun.
[05:30.66]Engaging.
[05:32.68]I think it was pretty formative.
[05:35.66]Alright, so we're going to watch the intro because I want you to see it.
[05:41.82]Here we go.
[05:46.89]Can I...
[05:49.89]Alright, the intro is not clickable.
[05:52.77]So, never mind.
[05:53.87]We're gonna skip that part.
[06:00.68]Zumbini Island.
[06:05.68]I can't watch the intro?
[06:06.70]Why?
[06:11.23]Don't skip.
[06:12.23]You hear me clicking.
[06:13.09]I am clicking as fast as I can.
[06:16.21]Will you play Left 4 Dead 2?
[06:19.32]Not right now.
[06:21.24]Watch the intro.
[06:22.22]I'm trying!
[06:22.82]Alright, I can't... Alright, the intro, it's just... The Zoombinis need to find a new place to live.
[06:38.57]And they've picked an area that they just need to traverse the dangerous world to get to.
[06:45.87]We have to make our characters.
[06:46.75]So the whole point of Zoombinis is you have to make a bunch of Zoombinis.
[06:49.95]Try to get them all.
[06:51.21]That's right.
[06:51.53]I said all.
[06:52.57]Not one.
[06:53.39]Not two.
[06:54.67]All of them.
[06:56.51]To survive.
[06:57.39]To the end.
[06:57.77]Stop.
[07:00.54]Let's start.
[07:01.12]Stop.
[07:02.34]Okay.
[07:04.38]I'm liking this.
[07:05.32]I'm liking that.
[07:08.64]And you could just make it all random too.
[07:13.08]Which is probably what a... Oh, you can... They have names.
[07:17.39]Oh.
[07:18.81]Oh, I just randomized the entire group.
[07:22.87]Alright, we got a lot of pink noses.
[07:25.37]And this matters, by the way.
[07:26.99]This is incredibly important.
[07:28.65]He did it again?
[07:29.47]Wait, I did this last- I did this six years ago?
[07:31.47]I'm just programmed to do something wrong.
[07:36.97]I did it the same- I did that already?
[07:41.59]Why am I programmed to do this wrong?
[07:43.78]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[07:44.94]Can I go back?
[07:59.38]Alright, how about we'll do half?
[08:01.38]Okay, we'll do half randomly generated.
[08:04.04]Because it's fun to be randomly generated.
[08:06.69]It needs to be this way.
[08:08.19]I'll make three people.
[08:12.43]Yep.
[08:17.43]Yep.
[08:24.40]Why wasn't there springs?
[08:25.26]We don't have any springs.
[08:27.00]What is going on here?
[08:32.81]Uh... Let's get a... How many... What do we have?
[08:35.49]A lot of green noses.
[08:37.49]Not a whole lot of blue noses.
[08:40.87]Where's Gunu?
[08:41.53]Uh, that's a different universe.
[08:46.07]Alright, I like that.
[08:46.71]Mmm, we got a lot of pink shoes.
[08:50.26]I don't know if I want more pink shoes.
[08:53.00]What do you guys think?
[08:54.12]I think we need more wheels.
[08:57.40]No, what are we missing?
[08:58.26]What do we not have a lot of?
[09:00.10]Blue shoes?
[09:07.46]Need more springs.
[09:08.46]Oh yeah, we do need more springs.
[09:09.56]Spring, red nose, sunglasses.
[09:11.88]We have a lot of sunglasses.
[09:12.78]We don't have very many of these eyes.
[09:17.92]Okay.
[09:23.62]Only a few more.
[09:24.06]Alright, another... Should we do a cyclops?
[09:30.97]Okay.
[09:34.45]A lot of this ponytail hair...
[09:42.76]Okay.
[09:45.62]These little guys.
[09:46.94]Edible.
[09:50.99]How does the game work?
[09:51.91]You will see very shortly.
[09:54.89]Need another one of these.
[09:55.53]Yeah, let's do... Like that.
[09:59.89]Green nose.
[10:01.27]Oh, that's it.
[10:01.77]Alright.
[10:02.21]Let's go.
[10:02.67]Let's go.
[10:03.39]Let's go.
[10:03.67]Let's go.
[10:05.52]Oops.
[10:16.95]after days tossed about by a stormy sea the zumbinis reach the shore of a peculiar land it's loud as it's just it's old it's an old 90s game where the cut scenes were dialed up times a thousand in audio alright are we ready I'm excited to play the logical journey of the zumbinis
[10:46.49]So, we have two bridges here.
[10:49.71]Probably asking, okay.
[10:51.85]The logical journey of the Zumbinis.
[10:54.01]We just have to cross the bridge, right?
[10:56.27]Let's go ahead and do it.
[10:58.32]Let's go ahead and do it.
[11:00.14]Let's send somebody across the bridge.
[11:05.04]Made it over safely.
[11:07.16]Safely.
[11:08.25]Okay.
[11:09.51]So let's deduce why that happened.
[11:15.80]Well, should I let you figure it out?
[11:17.68]Let's find out.
[11:18.18]Okay, ready?
[11:19.76]Let's have somebody else go across.
[11:25.46]Okay, so there was a problem there.
[11:30.13]I could not bring this guy over.
[11:34.13]And the reason for that... This is not my face.
[11:39.19]Why is everyone saying Jerma, Jerma?
[11:43.42]Alright, so this one made it across.
[11:45.25]What do you think is wrong with this one?
[11:46.31]You think it's the different nose color?
[11:47.79]Because that's what you have to figure out.
[11:49.63]Let's figure this out.
[11:50.27]Alright, is it yellow noses are allowed to cross?
[11:52.53]Uh-oh.
[11:57.53]And by the way, they can die.
[11:59.67]Just so you understand, they can die.
[12:03.48]You get it?
[12:04.36]Do you see what we're dealing with right now?
[12:09.96]Okay, is it... It's not the nose.
[12:13.59]So, is it the hair?
[12:16.13]Or is it the wheels?
[12:17.41]Alright, do we have any of the wheels?
[12:18.43]Alright, wheels and a completely different hairstyle.
[12:20.85]But the eyes are... Alright, everything is completely different but the wheels.
[12:23.19]Okay.
[12:27.16]If you have wheels, please go on the bottom bridge.
[12:29.68]Because that is what it is.
[12:35.38]Okay.
[12:38.74]So...
[12:41.54]What about springs?
[12:44.06]Alright, people are gonna start dying.
[12:46.26]Uh, so springs... Can springs go up here?
[12:51.57]Yeah, they have to be able to go through.
[12:56.77]Right?
[12:56.97]Okay.
[12:58.26]Alright.
[13:00.42]They get a little excited.
[13:05.41]Who couldn't make it?
[13:06.17]Okay, what about you?
[13:06.91]Yeah, you're fine.
[13:09.63]You're fine up there.
[13:10.31]Alright.
[13:12.79]You're fine up here.
[13:13.93]I think it's only based on the shoes.
[13:17.24]But I don't know about those.
[13:18.22]Let's just get everybody out.
[13:20.44]I think I'm just on the regular difficulty as well.
[13:22.24]I think this is going to be much harder as well.
[13:24.54]As well, as well, as well, as well.
[13:29.34]Alright.
[13:31.37]Settle down!
[13:31.67]Settle down!
[13:38.63]Alright, it's time to... What?
[13:45.52]It's alright.
[13:46.64]Alright, we got everybody.
[13:49.20]Everybody has safely made it across.
[13:52.52]And now they're all gonna go... Watch.
[13:54.10]Well, I did that sound, so that's fine.
[13:56.12]Where's the Diablo 4 endgame stream?
[14:10.00]You don't want to hear my D4 thoughts.
[14:13.60]You don't want to hear how I feel about D4.
[14:14.94]I don't think you want to hear how I feel about that game.
[14:18.11]I don't think you want to hear it.
[14:31.68]Alright, this one is like the bridge, but there's more places for error.
[14:36.40]Okay.
[14:36.71]So, just like the bridge, this one is also about letting...
[15:00.10]people pass depending on, like, the shoes they have and the hair they have.
[15:04.20]But as you see, there's multiple points of... failure.
[15:08.29]Because if... if this rock is fine and doesn't care, this one might care.
[15:16.59]So we have to deduce.
[15:19.15]Hey, it's logic, right?
[15:20.39]You're always gonna start somewhere.
[15:23.38]We're going pink shoes.
[15:24.72]We're going straight in this way.
[15:28.74]Alright, not happy about that, so... Some people are probably going to die here.
[15:38.87]I just want you to understand.
[15:39.95]Okay, so something about this I'm going to say, let's go left side.
[15:44.93]You're cool with this.
[15:46.55]You are not cool with that.
[15:47.73]Okay, so...
[15:55.53]What is this?
[15:56.37]You've got red nose, pink shoes, glasses.
[15:59.57]Alright, maybe it's glasses.
[16:02.07]Is it the glasses that you don't like?
[16:03.69]Let's see.
[16:05.11]Okay, who's got glasses?
[16:08.56]Excuse me.
[16:10.48]Okay, so it's the feet.
[16:13.42]Yeah, it's the feet.
[16:13.94]Alright, so you... It's propellers cannot go this way.
[16:18.66]So propellers have to go this way.
[16:20.22]Can the propellers go here?
[16:23.87]Yes, they... Okay.
[16:24.37]Okay.
[16:26.95]Is it based only on propeller for you, too?
[16:29.25]Are you good?
[16:32.89]Okay.
[16:36.07]That's weird.
[16:38.39]Alright, do we have... Oh, pink shoes.
[16:43.79]Is this... Okay, this is based on shoes, these... Okay, alright.
[16:48.02]So what about spring?
[16:50.18]You don't want spring.
[16:51.90]Do you care?
[16:56.97]You both don't care.
[16:59.05]Nobody is going up here.
[17:00.03]Okay.
[17:03.96]Speedrun the game?
[17:07.18]Alright, what about this way?
[17:10.78]Wheels?
[17:15.75]Alright.
[17:16.29]Okay.
[17:16.55]What about this way?
[17:23.95]Oh shit.
[17:25.11]Wait, what?
[17:27.70]What is it ab- oh.
[17:30.06]So what is the problem?
[17:30.68]Have a good time.
[17:31.54]Have a good time.
[17:38.14]This process is pleasant.
[17:42.53]Why are they doing this?
[17:44.51]What?
[17:48.85]Are you enjoying Final Fantasy 16 exclusively for the PS5 as a timed exclusive?
[17:53.65]Uh, yeah.
[17:54.91]I actually think it was fucking phenomenal.
[17:58.21]okay alright what about uh blue shoes this way welcome I think we got it so what was the problem what did she just didn't want anything enjoy yourself well you're okay this is just practice that you are their guide
[18:20.93]We're gonna do this again on hard, and you'll see how impossible the game is.
[18:25.35]And so our brave travelers continue on through this dusty wasteland until they meet Arno, the almost omnivorous, one very hungry pizza troll.
[18:40.30]Flings?
[18:42.04]You're not flings!
[18:44.16]Make me a pizza!
[18:48.24]Huh.
[18:50.00]Whatever you are.
[18:50.90]Make me a pizza.
[18:56.06]I used to sit here when I was younger.
[18:58.92]And the reason why I thought this was my favorite part of the game is because when you're younger, just making food.
[19:06.07]Oh, look, I made a jalapeño and pepperoni pizza.
[19:11.30]It's like, oh, okay.
[19:14.02]You get to like make stuff.
[19:17.04]Alright, we gotta go simple, though.
[19:18.34]Oops.
[19:19.44]I didn't... Okay, well, let's see.
[19:24.76]Alright, you have to... So... We're gonna play this again with the other characters, don't worry.
[19:28.85]I'm just... We're doing the tutorial.
[19:30.05]The tutorial is, can we get all 20 Zumbinis to the end on normal 5-year-old difficulty.
[19:37.37]Alright, so... He doesn't like it.
[19:39.07]There's something on this he doesn't like.
[19:40.62]So let's just try this as a regular cheese pizza.
[19:48.11]My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my.
[19:51.55]Okay, you like the cheese, but he wants toppings.
[19:57.48]Okay.
[19:59.98]So what, okay, something, maybe, was it the, I don't know.
[20:03.66]Maybe, maybe just pineapple?
[20:06.54]The perfect pizza!
[20:13.81]Alright, we got it.
[20:15.29]Pineapple and cheese pizza.
[20:18.04]I would have said gross.
[20:26.27]I have absolutely fucking said that before.
[20:28.59]Play the harder difficulty?
[20:31.90]Yeah, we're just doing the tutorial.
[20:34.22]I think we have to go through it once.
[20:43.27]eventually there are three different tree characters here and they're very specific but let's keep going how many hours do you have in this game I don't know like four
[21:15.68]hold on what's this a campsite with hot soup all ready to eat looks like a fine place for zumbinis to relax at the dock but when they're ready to move on they'll need a group of 16 along the path right so this game is kind of
[21:40.16]Let's turn the difficulty up.
[21:41.30]Why not?
[21:41.68]Let's go for it.
[21:42.42]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[21:43.52]No, no, no, no, no.
[21:45.22]No, no, no.
[21:46.26]Not yet.
[21:48.22]If you don't have enough Zumbinis, you have to have 16.
[21:54.23]If you don't have 16, you have to play the game again.
[22:00.11]But you have to get enough in the first three levels to be able to continue on.
[22:04.37]And we can go up or down, too.
[22:13.05]You have 16.
[22:13.53]Yeah, I know.
[22:14.03]I'm just showing you how it works.
[22:15.45]You know, when you do your full playthrough, you'll... You'll see.
[22:25.91]Alright, up or down?
[22:26.67]Uh, I forget... I forget what direction is easier.
[22:33.18]Go down?
[22:39.04]Down is better?
[22:40.40]I don't remember.
[22:44.86]Bro, no one's gonna play this other than you.
[22:48.40]Is this tutorial mode?
[22:49.54]Well, it's just easy mode.
[22:51.04]We'll go through it another two or three times.
[22:52.87]Because, if, well, I mean, I've played this game a lot.
[22:55.99]This is one of my favorite games.
[22:58.29]I haven't played the game in six or seven years, and then before that it's been like 15 or 20 or something, but you know, you get the idea.
[23:04.76]You have to get a ton of Zoombinis to the end to beat the game.
[23:09.50]This is one of my favorite games.
[23:11.34]You got a problem?
[23:14.54]What is going down?
[23:15.51]You got a problem?
[23:19.31]Do you have a problem with me?
[23:20.57]Is that like I'm asking?
[23:21.21]Do you have a problem with me sitting in the chair?
[23:23.37]Like in playing this?
[23:23.91]You got a problem?
[23:24.43]There's no sense leaving it up to chance.
[23:27.71]Lure the fleas off the tree branch.
[23:35.24]It's like swollen so weird.
[23:39.50]Oh, the fleas.
[23:40.44]That's right.
[23:44.29]alright you wonder why I like this game so much because all the zumbinis just go like like yeah of course I like the game alright so each fleen is matched to each individual zumbini
[24:10.62]so we have to figure out what is matched with what so we're just going to sacrifice somebody alright so juice blue shoes is the treads these eyes are the mask the little hair follicle is the helmet so
[24:37.85]We need to knock them off of this branch.
[24:40.33]So we need to find a hair follicle.
[24:43.49]With those eyes.
[24:48.07]Okay, hair follicle with... Okay.
[24:50.78]And then the tank.
[24:54.68]It's gonna be... Alright, this is it.
[24:56.80]This is one of them.
[25:01.45]Old and unhealthy.
[25:02.73]Yeah.
[25:06.02]Zumbinis are... I love this game.
[25:11.24]I used to play this when I was younger, and I'm just trying to desperately hold on to my youth.
[25:18.97]Okay, so we don't... What's the mohawk?
[25:22.37]We know that the spinny is the tank.
[25:26.79]Green nose is...
[25:31.00]blue okay so somebody that has these eyes and a spinny yep okay ponytails mohawk so we have a few more options oh no we don't no it's like just two okay so it's this one because it's gonna match that
[26:04.36]Rock outbreak.
[26:07.06]That was a lot.
[26:08.12]Good thing I had it turned down.
[26:17.79]Big brain moment.
[26:19.05]I actually don't know how much harder they make that at the higher difficulty.
[26:31.70]Hurry, Zumpinis.
[26:34.06]Ula, the forest's foremost.
[26:36.28]This sounds like a garbage disposal.
[26:38.18]The band leader is about to begin rehearsals.
[26:42.00]She'll be closing the hotel for the night, so scamper into a room.
[26:46.21]A garbage, like, wait, you mean that rock song?
[26:51.21]Guests?
[26:53.59]Ah, guests.
[26:55.54]I'll be right down.
[26:57.40]Make yourselves cozy.
[27:00.02]Oh, that's right.
[27:00.66]We have to... If I remember... As the game gets harder, I think the rooms stack up this tall and this wide.
[27:05.86]So it gets very hard.
[27:08.91]And I think there's a timer.
[27:10.91]Alright, so we have to see who can be in the same hotel room.
[27:28.28]Okay.
[27:29.02]Is it about... Can you go in?
[27:31.04]Okay.
[27:32.42]It's probably just shoes.
[27:34.04]It's probably shoes.
[27:39.26]We're on the easiest difficulty.
[27:40.36]It's definitely just shoes.
[27:44.40]It's not.
[27:44.80]Okay.
[27:46.69]Is it... Uh oh.
[27:50.91]Is it... I don't know.
[27:53.91]Noses?
[27:54.71]Noses?
[27:57.40]This is too blue.
[27:58.22]This is blue and red.
[28:01.61]Eyes?
[28:01.83]It's eyes.
[28:02.61]That's the eyes.
[28:04.11]Alright, so we need any more... Okay, it's the eyes.
[28:08.35]You guys are so smart.
[28:18.60]No elk.
[28:24.55]We have to get one batch of Zoombinis across to the end.
[28:27.30]Because when it gets harder, it's easy to lose people.
[28:35.80]Alright, yeah, this plays out.
[28:42.86]Zoombini race!
[28:49.47]Hey, that's cool.
[28:51.99]A place for everyone and everyone in a place.
[28:55.13]Please protect the red glasses with your life.
[29:07.87]I'll try.
[29:13.83]Strike the targets one and all, and watch for a pattern on Mudball Wall.
[29:20.46]Mudball Wall.
[29:21.28]I love this one.
[29:21.88]I used to just fail this one deliberately because it was fun just to use the toy.
[29:25.46]Okay.
[29:30.05]So.
[29:30.13]Where... So this is...
[29:38.00]green ball with square fire it I just went a hundred million miles per hour we got it right alright so that was very fast I think the game is running at 60 FPS so the the game runs at 6 000 percent speed
[30:00.85]So this is how many we're allowed to bring up.
[30:04.35]So that was a green square.
[30:05.95]What is red square?
[30:07.73]Is red square going to be over here?
[30:08.88]It's not.
[30:11.60]Okay.
[30:12.48]So color is the column.
[30:16.36]And shape is the row.
[30:19.52]Alright.
[30:20.44]So we're looking for... I think... Let's just go blue.
[30:28.24]And... Got it.
[30:36.57]Alright, so no more... It just scared me.
[30:42.68]For a second I thought they were doing a frog noise.
[30:44.18]I was like, no, we're in a swamp.
[30:47.56]Chat is so stupid to find this confusing.
[30:50.69]Wait, do I know something that chat doesn't know?
[30:58.67]This doesn't make sense.
[30:59.97]Wait, am I better at chat at a logical journey of the Zumbini's puzzle game?
[31:07.11]You don't get it?
[31:09.15]Are you struggling to do it?
[31:10.88]You don't get it?
[31:13.10]Oh, that's too bad.
[31:16.76]Alright, so let's do triangle blue.
[31:20.54]Let's hope it's right there.
[31:22.71]No, it's right there.
[31:23.51]That's fine.
[31:28.39]Uh, star blue?
[31:30.45]It has to be at some point down here.
[31:33.12]Alright, that's fine.
[31:35.62]It's circle and diamond.
[31:40.78]Now I get it.
[31:41.50]Yeah, you get it.
[31:48.24]Eventually, this gets to be, like, three different colors, and the board is, like, huge with, like, a thousand different combinations.
[31:58.09]Alright, so triangle.
[31:59.15]Uh, yellow.
[32:05.01]Yeah!
[32:08.04]Triangle pink.
[32:11.00]Hurry up.
[32:14.58]Alright, we got him.
[32:17.76]Now we need to do... Star green.
[32:24.47]What an educational experience.
[32:28.53]How come you keep mentioning the harder difficulty?
[32:30.17]I don't know.
[32:38.21]I still don't get it.
[32:40.29]So color is going to always be part of the rows.
[32:45.18]That's my favorite character.
[32:52.46]And he's proving to you why.
[33:04.07]Alright, here it is.
[33:04.57]Here it comes, here it comes.
[33:05.18]This is the best part of the whole game.
[33:09.39]This is the single best part of the whole game is right now.
[33:20.95]You keep saying that?
[33:21.61]No, I mean it.
[33:22.17]Here it comes.
[33:22.49]Why is he evil laughing?
[33:54.13]I always found that so funny since I was younger, just because... Why is the narrator... The narrator's trying to guide them and help.
[34:01.83]Be like, oh, there's some beanies!
[34:02.88]Finally, a campsite!
[34:04.58]And then you're gonna do an evil villain laugh?
[34:11.50]Go.
[34:17.90]This game formed your entire personality.
[34:20.13]Throughout these gloomy mountains...
[34:22.82]Strange carvings left by ancient peoples are everywhere.
[34:30.78]Twist villain.
[34:31.60]Alright, I forget this one.
[34:37.61]I think it's just like noses.
[34:40.35]I'm doing easy first so people don't owe Megalel he has to be pretending in the first 30 minutes of the stream.
[34:53.02]Alright, it's okay.
[34:53.94]This is just noses.
[34:56.71]And then, do we have any more blues?
[35:00.01]Yellow.
[35:02.29]Oh.
[35:05.25]Oh, shit.
[35:05.83]Okay, wait.
[35:06.31]Oh, there's another blue nose.
[35:07.17]Okay.
[35:19.71]I can feel you breathing down my neck.
[35:21.61]Do you know what I mean?
[35:22.45]I don't know why right now I just decided I was... Because this is simple, but I don't know why I can like... Oh, okay.
[35:33.95]Actually, don't screw this up.
[35:43.29]You did it!
[35:44.85]You saved them all!
[35:46.69]Let's go.
[35:51.23]Okay, tutorial complete.
[35:55.21]Wait, there might be one or two more.
[35:59.33]Use the crystal filters to change the Zumbini's reflection.
[36:04.02]It will give them crystal slamming protection.
[36:10.00]This is the Rube Goldberg room.
[36:16.16]Oh no, that's not this way.
[36:17.70]Alright, what is this one?
[36:22.51]I forget this one.
[36:23.63]You have to put... Is it just a mirror?
[36:30.09]I forget.
[36:32.47]Okay, I killed the only one everybody cared about.
[36:59.56]Okay, um... What did I do wrong here?
[37:03.22]I forget how this one works.
[37:22.30]Is it opposites?
[37:23.16]No.
[37:32.32]Wait a minute.
[37:34.08]No, I can't.
[37:35.00]I can't put two on here.
[37:35.84]Yeah, I can't put two.
[37:40.42]I think it has to match somehow, but match what?
[37:50.14]There's two seats.
[37:50.80]Yeah, but I can't see.
[37:51.90]I can't.
[37:52.42]I cannot click and drag anybody else over.
[38:03.30]Oh, wait a minute.
[38:04.22]Wait a minute.
[38:04.88]Wait a minute.
[38:05.38]Okay.
[38:07.56]Somebody is here.
[38:08.52]Okay, somebody is here.
[38:12.07]I thought it was like matching noses.
[38:13.25]Okay, I get it.
[38:13.75]I get it.
[38:13.97]I get it.
[38:14.41]I'm not pretending.
[38:15.13]It's been 25 years since I've played the game.
[38:20.13]Seven years ago, I... It's been seven years since I've played this game.
[38:25.71]A lot has happened in the last seven years.
[38:27.39]Okay.
[38:30.15]Who is this?
[38:30.49]Do we have this one?
[38:35.45]Alright.
[38:35.85]That one's match.
[38:41.93]And then it resets.
[38:43.37]Okay.
[38:43.91]Good.
[38:46.24]Does it?
[38:46.90]No.
[38:50.82]Spring.
[38:51.42]Blue nose.
[38:53.54]No.
[38:54.40]Spring.
[38:54.76]Red nose.
[38:56.36]No.
[38:58.58]Pink.
[38:59.56]Blue.
[39:00.80]Pink.
[39:02.78]No.
[39:04.80]No.
[39:08.66]This one here.
[39:12.36]Hop right.
[39:12.94]Don't be silly.
[39:13.68]I just did it.
[39:14.04]Alright.
[39:18.99]Who else?
[39:21.87]I can't believe I killed the only person everybody wanted me to save.
[39:24.65]And that's the only person that's not gonna make it to the end.
[39:27.85]That's the only one.
[39:30.79]The only one that didn't make it.
[39:44.00]Alright.
[39:45.76]We got... Not this one?
[39:54.15]I've been so... I've been, like, just so burpy.
[39:57.17]I don't even know why.
[40:00.11]What's happening to my body?
[40:01.67]My body's turning old.
[40:02.97]Okay.
[40:12.58]Where the...
[40:22.42]Getting old and burpy happens to the best of us.
[40:30.66]There we go.
[40:32.64]I'm speeding it up.
[40:33.96]I'm speeding it up.
[40:35.06]I'm going much faster than I was before.
[40:36.74]Alright.
[40:47.73]I can't believe I killed that person.
[40:48.95]Okay.
[41:08.39]restart we're gonna restart okay uh I'm looking for uh no you're you're fine this one here
[41:27.47]Zumbinis do not have an afterlife.
[41:31.31]Oh.
[41:32.39]Sorry.
[41:32.75]Oops.
[41:38.01]How do you know that?
[41:38.73]Alright.
[41:51.08]It'll start getting easier here.
[41:52.12]Okay.
[41:54.16]Pink shoes.
[41:56.00]There we go.
[42:02.35]No, they're lying.
[42:02.87]They have an afterlife, but it sucks.
[42:07.81]Oh, okay.
[42:12.09]Pink shoes.
[42:15.15]Oh, I almost did this one.
[42:16.10]Green nose.
[42:16.62]What the hell is it?
[42:28.22]Pink nose.
[42:32.84]Okay.
[42:36.58]It's gonna be one of the springs, right?
[42:43.46]Has to be.
[42:44.24]Has to be.
[42:49.56]Spring.
[42:49.82]No?
[42:50.18]No.
[43:00.85]I think it's this one.
[43:02.08]This one.
[43:08.14]Why am I doing the BioShock Infinite thing?
[43:12.02]And it was a price I paid.
[43:14.58]Price I paid.
[43:15.36]Okay.
[43:31.02]How you doing today?
[43:31.48]I'm doing good.
[43:34.60]You doing good too?
[43:36.16]You good?
[43:45.77]Zumbinieville!
[43:49.99]We're about to be there.
[43:54.04]We made it to Zumbinieville.
[44:05.24]No, there's more.
[44:15.62]This is the one that gets in my head.
[44:20.36]Because you have to put... There's two entry points, and depending on what they have for features, they move in a different direction.
[44:26.98]So I have to be careful.
[44:29.10]So if somebody goes here and they have these eyes, they're going to stop here and move this way, then up, up, right.
[44:37.58]So anybody that has these eyes is safe.
[44:41.90]Oh, wait, I don't want to do that.
[44:43.10]Yeah, I do.
[44:48.43]What if you don't?
[44:49.49]Okay, if you do not have these eyes, you're dead if you go this way.
[44:56.28]So let's get this right because I don't want to lose anybody else.
[45:03.73]So let's say you are a spring and I put you this way.
[45:08.47]You're going to go straight through that.
[45:10.11]You're going to go up, right, down, left, up, right, right.
[45:17.01]Okay.
[45:17.33]It's going to turn this thing that way.
[45:22.08]Let me know.
[45:27.36]What do you mean she's dead?
[45:28.24]No, she's not.
[45:29.25]Oh, fuck.
[45:29.71]She has the hair.
[45:31.07]Oh, that's right.
[45:31.77]It's alright.
[45:33.55]Everybody wave bye when she passes by.
[45:35.29]Am I going to make it?
[45:39.07]Oh, I don't know what that means, but hopefully it's yes.
[45:52.21]Dead.
[45:54.59]Okay.
[45:57.21]Oh, hold on.
[45:57.67]I always had trouble with this one, even on, like, the kids' difficulty.
[46:00.33]Okay.
[46:01.27]So, up.
[46:02.87]If you don't have those eyes, you'll go right.
[46:08.23]If you have the mohawk, you're gonna go down, up, down, left, die.
[46:15.22]Shit.
[46:15.64]Let's just get everybody over there that we know we can get over there.
[46:35.16]OK.
[46:39.95]So if you have hair, you need to go now because no.
[46:44.27]So all the eyes are gone.
[46:46.13]So if you have this, you're going to go up.
[46:50.36]You're going to go through this, right?
[46:53.92]OK, here we go.
[47:02.79]What do you mean no?
[47:04.79]What do you mean wrong, bad?
[47:06.39]What?
[47:07.61]You made it!
[47:07.97]What are you talking about?
[47:11.41]I made it, it's correct!
[47:14.21]Okay, so now if I do a mohawk, it's gonna go up, up, right, down, left, up, right.
[47:22.33]So we can't have a mohawk go that way.
[47:31.64]Chat is waffling.
[47:34.63]Do more funny murders.
[47:36.01]Ha ha ha ha.
[47:38.98]This is only going to get way harder.
[47:40.84]So trust me, if you're sitting here waiting to make fun of me.
[47:44.48]Hey, Jerma, I was watching your stream yesterday and I didn't have a chance to make fun of how stupid you were.
[47:49.58]I'm kind of bored not being able to make fun of you, not being able to do this children's puzzle game.
[47:54.02]So I think I'm going to take a break of watching your stream for a few weeks.
[47:57.83]Just wait.
[47:58.85]Just wait till we play on the medium and hard difficulties because you're probably going to get your fill of that.
[48:07.55]Okay.
[48:08.17]So now... I think I can just alternate.
[48:10.71]Because if I do the hair now... Alright.
[48:14.72]Is this right?
[48:16.96]No.
[48:19.21]Yes, it is.
[48:19.55]Okay.
[48:39.01]Is somebody dead here?
[48:44.40]Hold on.
[48:49.68]Because if this... Okay, if you go up right... Okay, yeah, we're good.
[48:57.93]Only one person died.
[49:01.91]We got, what, 14 out of 16?
[49:10.54]We're good.
[49:25.79]Hey, what happened to the red glasses?
[49:30.81]Well... I've been trying to hold this together.
[49:36.03]Then you just reminded me.
[49:40.27]worry not for those left behind they'll make their way back to safety no they won't we did it is this it could this be the place they've been seeking a place of hope and prosperity
[50:10.78]Alright, how many did we get?
[50:11.76]14?
[50:11.78]Yes!
[50:11.88]Look at... Look at all of our friends that made it.
[50:39.80]As you bring Zumbinis to Zumbiniville, more structures are created.
[50:47.23]More stuff is available, as you see.
[50:48.89]We got the windmill.
[50:53.13]And now let's go back.
[50:55.55]Very cool.
[50:58.11]Okay.
[51:00.80]Not so easy.
[51:02.08]Very hard.
[51:04.36]Very, very hard.
[51:10.06]What is it?
[51:11.02]Okay.
[51:11.32]There are 384 Zumbinis.
[51:20.58]So how do we change these?
[51:24.19]I forget.
[51:24.53]Can I not press it?
[51:33.37]Because for journey... Oh, practice, we're not taking anybody.
[51:38.78]How do I make it harder?
[51:44.46]It scales with you how many you save.
[51:48.22]Oh, okay.
[51:51.52]Alright, so we're going to go up this time.
[51:53.26]We went down and it took us this way.
[51:54.82]Up is going to take us around this way.
[51:56.08]So let's just do it again.
[51:57.48]Journey just gets harder.
[51:58.40]Okay, yeah, let's go.
[51:59.22]Let's go.
[51:59.60]Let's get all 384.
[52:00.04]Oh, glasses!
[52:00.28]Glasses!
[52:00.49]Glasses!
[52:22.87]Eh.
[52:24.73]Glasses!
[52:25.89]Oh, that's too many glasses.
[52:26.95]Way too many.
[52:33.69]Eh, fuck it.
[52:34.05]Let's go.
[52:42.11]Alright, now we speedrun.
[52:43.23]Now we understand how it works, we go fast.
[52:46.19]Speedrun time.
[52:51.38]So you get how it works.
[52:56.56]We have to get all the Zoombinis over to the Zoombini island.
[53:03.93]You remember how this one works?
[53:04.81]We're just gonna go.
[53:05.63]Alright.
[53:07.01]Good start.
[53:07.67]Let's see.
[53:08.05]It's probably just wheels.
[53:10.11]It's definitely just wheels.
[53:11.13]We're still on easy, I think.
[53:13.07]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[53:14.53]They made it harder.
[53:16.85]Maybe it's noses.
[53:18.49]Blue.
[53:20.69]Got it.
[53:23.63]Got it.
[53:24.39]Alright, what about pink?
[53:25.76]Let's go pink up here.
[53:26.50]Okay.
[53:30.86]Pink is also down here.
[53:34.32]The rock does look like you.
[53:35.64]This does not look like me at all.
[53:41.28]Looks nothing like my face it looks zero and I mean zero wait a minute So what is it then why did you not is it not noses I
[54:10.75]Okay, so it's... Spinners, blue shoes, and... Is that correct?
[54:18.66]No, that's not correct.
[54:20.50]You're going to kill these things.
[54:22.36]Is it the hair?
[54:26.88]No, it's not.
[54:34.71]Is it the... I think maybe it is the hair.
[54:36.13]Alright, this one is a ponytail.
[54:44.31]Okay, I'm gonna put this on the screen.
[54:49.69]I like this.
[54:56.78]I like this.
[54:57.26]I'm putting it here.
[55:08.46]I love how it's the shoes from Gen Lost.
[55:11.16]That's funny.
[55:17.73]There we go.
[55:18.13]Alright.
[55:19.01]I'm in.
[55:19.21]Alright.
[55:25.77]So it was hair.
[55:27.27]Okay.
[55:37.41]Is it Mohawk?
[55:42.66]Uh, these ones were a lot... Okay, yeah.
[55:44.78]Alright, we're good.
[55:46.58]Let's go.
[55:48.08]That's good, because I could have only made one more mistake.
[55:50.10]Oh, shit.
[55:53.36]Oh, what about I gotta do me, too?
[56:03.84]Okay, let's put me over here.
[56:10.97]Oh, fuck.
[56:13.46]I can't keep going.
[56:14.50]I got eliminated.
[56:15.56]Splendid job.
[56:31.22]These stone guards have their rules so do proceed with skill Zumbini's one guard won't allow The other guard surely will
[56:56.56]Alright.
[56:58.98]So don't screw it up.
[57:00.51]Because if you lose anybody in the early game, you may as well just restart.
[57:10.27]Just gotta pick up, pick up.
[57:11.35]Alright.
[57:13.79]What the hell?
[57:14.63]Alright.
[57:16.55]What about this side?
[57:18.29]Okay.
[57:20.24]Is it propeller?
[57:23.76]Is it not propeller?
[57:26.47]It's also not... potentially not even nose.
[57:28.54]Is it eyes?
[57:33.16]Okay.
[57:34.58]But you might not be happy with... Okay.
[57:39.86]Glasses?
[57:40.48]All glasses this way?
[57:41.50]You're gonna stop one of these.
[57:44.76]I know you are.
[57:45.18]No.
[57:47.77]Alright, we're good.
[57:54.01]Propellers?
[57:56.86]Good.
[57:57.02]Alright.
[57:57.28]What about skateboards?
[57:58.68]Skateboards?
[57:59.46]Okay.
[57:59.84]Propeller.
[58:00.32]Spring this way.
[58:01.60]Shut up.
[58:02.06]Propeller this way.
[58:04.90]Alright.
[58:05.34]Pink shoes this way.
[58:06.34]Nailed it.
[58:28.77]Oh.
[58:30.21]Sorry, pal.
[58:33.98]What's wrong with this character?
[58:36.08]Blue.
[58:36.90]Wait, what?
[58:42.74]No glass.
[58:44.17]Oh.
[58:45.69]Have a good time.
[58:46.89]You did it.
[58:48.43]You saved them all.
[58:51.01]You're throwing.
[58:51.87]I'm all fine.
[58:53.25]You've done quite well.
[58:55.49]How delightful.
[58:57.21]He's so stupid.
[58:58.59]And so our brave travelers continue on through this dusty wasteland until... You have to deduce it first, man.
[59:05.81]Almost omnivorous.
[59:07.61]One very hungry pizza troll.
[59:09.85]Alright, pizza troll time.
[59:11.39]Flinges?
[59:13.15]You're not flings.
[59:17.41]Should still be pretty easy.
[59:18.43]Huh.
[59:21.15]Oh, we start with cheese every time.
[59:27.20]Okay.
[59:35.48]Let's do the same thing we did last time.
[59:40.12]Let's see if the RNG gave us the exact same thing.
[59:46.47]Based.
[59:53.56]Okay.
[59:55.26]Uh, what about just jalapeños?
[60:05.37]More stuff.
[60:09.27]I think this guy, in particular, formed my entire personality.
[60:14.45]Somehow.
[60:17.69]More stuff.
[60:20.73]So, if I... I gotta get this right.
[60:25.61]Uhm.
[60:27.79]Don't like.
[60:29.83]That maybe.
[60:35.59]Something Moscow OK.
[60:38.90]So it's mushrooms and jalapeños.
[60:41.10]I don't.
[60:44.16]Oh my pizza.
[61:08.29]You did it!
[61:09.85]You saved them all!
[61:14.08]The other two characters in this, eventually as you keep going and you progress and you get harder, the other two characters are great too.
[61:19.90]You have to please three different people with tons of toppings.
[61:32.83]Boilers live.
[61:38.19]Hold on.
[61:39.54]What's this?
[61:41.08]A campsite with hot soup all ready to eat?
[61:45.58]Looks like a fine place for Zoombinis to relax.
[61:50.82]But when they're ready to move on, they'll need a group of 16 along the way.
[61:55.57]Let's go up.
[62:02.75]We do not go up yet.
[62:03.89]Oh, you need to match somebody.
[62:09.12]This gets ridiculous, I remember, later on.
[62:13.10]It has to be perfect.
[62:14.48]How about right here?
[62:15.56]Hmm.
[62:35.58]They have to have something in common.
[62:37.82]You have to have something in common with your neighbor.
[62:52.87]Blue noses?
[62:53.71]Okay, uh...
[63:05.25]Do hair?
[63:05.75]We'll do noses first.
[63:07.79]Blue nose.
[63:08.85]And then... Hair.
[63:16.27]And then... Wait.
[63:24.03]There you go.
[63:24.54]You got it.
[63:27.22]Um... And then... This.
[63:30.74]Green.
[63:34.12]Um...
[63:35.92]Ring.
[63:37.48]Hair.
[63:37.78]Uh... There you go, you got it.
[63:46.27]Okay, hold on.
[63:49.41]You blew it?
[63:49.89]This is not on a timelet.
[64:08.24]No!
[64:08.72]What?
[64:12.06]What?
[64:13.23]Hair!
[64:14.23]Oh shit.
[64:15.13]Right.
[64:28.90]Ah, sure!
[64:38.65]Shit.
[64:39.97]Hold on.
[64:43.93]Is there any yellow noses?
[64:49.25]This'll do it, right?
[64:50.17]Will it?
[64:51.01]No.
[64:51.15]Okay, I need... Put a yellow nose at the start.
[64:58.43]What if I do this?
[64:59.29]Bingo.
[65:03.43]Got him all.
[65:08.91]I had it?
[65:09.29]Yeah, I got it.
[65:11.32]I got it.
[65:13.00]Color, flower, and lily pad shape tool may be the keys that get them through.
[65:24.46]I'll give you a little bit of a tidbit.
[65:27.07]In the 30 years that I've come back and played this game, every half decade or so, I've never beaten this truly.
[65:37.87]It's always wrong, especially the medium to hard ones, I think is impossible.
[65:42.80]I think they actually made it not possible.
[65:44.38]So you guys can help when we get to hard, because it's actually not physically possible to beat it.
[65:50.77]is uneasy okay um so what happens here is I believe you put somebody on a frog and they jump out and they have to match a path based on the color or the shape because you can't move anything so I have to put this somewhere where it's going to get to the other side based on I don't know shape
[66:15.24]This one is shaped like the lily pad here.
[66:18.48]So if I put this one here, it'll go up, and then they'll die.
[66:23.36]I think.
[66:35.39]I'm just gonna, I, we'll, we have to figure it out.
[66:36.93]I'm just gonna go for it.
[66:37.59]Because this one is blue.
[66:40.26]You can only put this on a blue...
[66:43.17]So they're based on color and shape.
[66:45.19]So, okay, if I put this one here, this is the three leaf one.
[66:51.57]No.
[66:59.06]Okay, this, where am I going?
[67:00.74]Oh, shit, I missed it.
[67:01.78]This one is correct for the three leaf.
[67:04.94]Because it'll go here, and then it'll go up.
[67:07.98]Okay, so this one is correct for the three leaf.
[67:14.35]Get somebody on here.
[67:22.75]Alright, yellow.
[67:25.27]Just go this way.
[67:26.13]But wait a minute.
[67:30.21]Is it the flower it's looking at?
[67:34.73]What about four leaf?
[67:36.17]Four leaf, where can I start?
[67:37.71]Here?
[67:37.93]Okay, I can start here.
[67:44.19]Can I just do that as many times as I want?
[67:48.07]The four leaf does not have a path.
[67:49.61]I don't think so.
[67:54.80]The line is the color, yeah.
[67:56.08]So if I go pink... Pink can... No.
[68:00.07]Yeah, wait.
[68:00.89]Alright, pink can do it right here.
[68:09.68]Each frog can be used twice.
[68:11.34]Okay, that's good to know.
[68:13.36]What about blue?
[68:14.24]This looks pretty solid.
[68:17.14]Yep.
[68:17.54]This is solid for blue.
[68:18.46]What about the X?
[68:24.41]X does not have a starting path, so... Fuck.
[68:28.51]What about this one?
[68:35.02]This one also does not have a starting path.
[68:45.61]Dark blue has a path.
[68:52.00]What about Pac-Man?
[68:52.76]Pac-Man has a starting path and doesn't go anywhere.
[68:55.62]No.
[68:57.32]Wait.
[68:57.56]Alright, Pac-Man has the correct path here.
[69:06.03]What about red?
[69:11.67]No.
[69:13.59]What about this shape?
[69:20.89]Yeah, alright, this shape has a path.
[69:24.65]Uh, right here, it doesn't matter, right?
[69:32.94]Each one can be used twice, so this is fine.
[69:41.40]What about yellow?
[69:42.19]Yellow, yeah, yellow can do it too.
[69:44.57]Will they hurt each other if they run into each other?
[69:55.05]Which one was it?
[69:55.51]This one, right?
[69:56.11]Yeah.
[69:56.43]This one here, right?
[69:57.57]Yep.
[70:00.54]Okay.
[70:04.64]What about this?
[70:05.54]I can start here.
[70:06.42]Uh-oh.
[70:10.52]No, this doesn't work.
[70:14.15]Here?
[70:19.41]This doesn't work either.
[70:20.07]I don't think this one works at all.
[70:25.92]What about an X?
[70:26.92]No?
[70:29.08]Yellow?
[70:29.52]Yellow can still go.
[70:30.36]I need four more.
[70:34.04]Diamond does work?
[70:38.15]Where are you seeing diamond working?
[70:45.79]No, diamond doesn't have a path.
[70:56.02]Where do you see Diamond's path?
[70:57.30]Down?
[70:59.16]Stop turning.
[71:00.02]It does.
[71:00.62]It does.
[71:00.82]It does.
[71:01.10]Bottom.
[71:01.44]Diamond at the bottom works.
[71:04.86]Up.
[71:05.56]Right.
[71:06.26]Right.
[71:06.90]Down.
[71:08.10]No, it doesn't.
[71:09.58]It gets stuck right here.
[71:18.22]No.
[71:19.02]Wait.
[71:19.52]Diamond.
[71:20.14]Diamond.
[71:20.44]Diamond.
[71:20.70]Diamond.
[71:21.00]Diamond.
[71:21.34]Diamond.
[71:21.62]No.
[71:22.86]No.
[71:30.72]Middle, middle, middle.
[71:32.62]Teal diamond?
[71:36.68]No, look, look, see?
[71:38.60]It gets trapped right here.
[71:43.36]Ah!
[71:43.52]Alright, three leaf.
[71:50.85]We only need three more.
[71:51.49]It was a three leaf that worked already, wasn't it?
[71:55.43]I think it's this one here.
[72:00.34]Yeah, it's this one here.
[72:10.78]That was the Pac-Man one over here, right?
[72:20.35]Why so many ads?
[72:23.87]You should not be getting any ads in Pac-Man.
[72:28.35]I mean, when you come to the stream, you get one.
[72:30.21]I can't turn those off.
[72:31.07]There's a lot of ads right now.
[72:33.21]I didn't run any.
[72:35.29]Alright, one more.
[72:39.06]Who's the last one?
[72:40.84]The diamond, okay.
[72:45.74]Got it.
[72:49.32]I haven't gotten any.
[72:50.18]I've gotten 12.
[72:51.14]I think you're making that up.
[72:59.45]Wanna play an ad?
[73:08.64]Do you guys remember when you guys would force me to run ads?
[73:15.68]And you pretended to like it.
[73:17.04]It was really weird.
[73:25.81]It was like, ads, oh my god, PogChamp, please, more ads.
[73:29.94]And you guys weren't kidding.
[73:31.24]You actually wanted me to do it.
[73:32.49]It was very funny and weird.
[73:47.31]I feel like the upper path is the hard path.
[73:53.24]Because I remember some of these being very, very, very hard later.
[73:58.22]This being one of them.
[73:59.70]I don't know what this wants me to do.
[74:00.78]So we're going to have to figure it out.
[74:03.14]I think it's hair has to match hair.
[74:05.02]So there and there.
[74:12.25]Nobody else even has this haircut.
[74:19.31]Nobody else has this haircut.
[74:27.17]Nose and nose.
[74:30.51]Um... It was a green nose.
[74:35.37]Did I kill that?
[74:36.13]Okay, I thought I killed that person.
[74:37.96]I just misclicked.
[74:41.08]Okay, that's nose.
[74:45.36]How do I... How do I get...
[74:49.65]There are 16 slots, right?
[74:52.19]Somebody has to go here.
[75:01.35]Oh, it's not this haircut.
[75:04.36]It's any... I thought... It's this haircut.
[75:21.65]Let's just get everybody out there and figure it out.
[75:33.56]My eyes.
[75:35.08]This one.
[75:36.56]The rest are eyes.
[75:39.66]You saw me click in the right spot.
[75:41.94]You saw that happen.
[75:50.89]Okay.
[75:52.37]So.
[75:54.07]Who has glasses?
[75:58.25]You've got glasses, so you could go here.
[76:01.77]You've got glasses, you could go here.
[76:03.33]Does anybody have a green nose that can move?
[76:08.73]Down this way.
[76:10.75]Alright.
[76:11.03]Does anybody have this haircut that can come up here?
[76:17.13]You do.
[76:19.43]There it is.
[76:24.87]Oh fuck.
[76:31.09]I need a blue nose to be here.
[76:45.16]Where's a blue nose that can come over here?
[76:46.70]You have blue nose.
[76:50.34]Blue nose.
[76:51.92]Eyes.
[76:52.44]I need... These eyes need to be the correct match.
[77:03.62]Go back so bad.
[77:04.96]I'm fine!
[77:06.70]Stop!
[77:08.56]Okay, I need eyes.
[77:12.19]Then the hair needs to match over here.
[77:29.79]I need a yellow nose.
[77:36.25]I need that haircut.
[77:38.45]I need a pink nose.
[77:39.55]Do you have it?
[77:50.63]Do I?
[77:54.53]98.5, bottom left.
[77:55.11]Shit.
[78:08.83]Why did I only make one spring person?
[78:11.78]The eyes?
[78:12.28]Do the eyes, the eyes, the eyes.
[78:15.36]Wait.
[78:16.12]Pink nose?
[78:16.82]Wait, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[78:22.17]Stop, stop, I got it, I got it.
[78:23.13]I have to put...
[78:40.89]I genuinely... I...
[79:10.70]Alright.
[79:11.46]They can't see now.
[79:13.12]Those of you that have ad block, alright, fine.
[79:14.70]But, like, at least I can block out for a minute.
[79:17.19]Right?
[79:17.45]Like, help me.
[79:17.85]What do I do?
[79:18.15]What do I do?
[79:19.31]Help me.
[79:19.51]What do I do?
[79:20.05]We got a minute.
[79:20.79]How do I do this so I can fucking, when they come back from the ad, I can really make myself look really good?
[79:26.23]You got, like, 42 seconds.
[79:27.79]You got, like, 40 seconds left.
[79:30.18]No help.
[79:30.52]Yes.
[79:32.06]Two.
[79:32.50]Which one?
[79:33.50]Which one?
[79:33.78]Which one?
[79:34.02]Which one?
[79:34.48]Move yellow nose left.
[79:35.46]Okay.
[79:37.38]Now what?
[79:37.82]Hurry.
[79:38.04]Hurry.
[79:38.20]Hurry.
[79:38.32]Hurry.
[79:38.56]Hurry.
[79:38.72]Before they get back.
[79:39.64]Swap yellow noses.
[79:46.20]Uh.
[79:47.30]We've got 20 seconds.
[79:47.92]Yellow nose.
[79:48.42]Do the yellow nose again.
[79:49.96]The other one.
[79:52.72]Are there yellow nose?
[79:59.45]I fucked it up.
[80:00.29]I fucked it up.
[80:01.05]I gotta get it right, though.
[80:02.71]Move.
[80:03.19]Honestly, I don't even know who I clicked on.
[80:05.23]I don't remember who I clicked on.
[80:10.09]I don't.
[80:11.01]It just blended together.
[80:11.71]I don't know who I clicked on.
[80:12.51]There's no undo.
[80:14.10]There's no undo.
[80:17.96]Put the yellow noses together.
[80:19.53]I just- I did, I did, I did, I did, I did, I did, I did!
[80:21.45]I- ugh.
[80:24.57]This one hurts my head.
[80:25.65]I have to- Should I run more ads so they have to wait and then they can- hold on.
[80:32.07]The other one?
[80:41.95]What the fuck just happened?
[80:45.69]There's only three yellow noses.
[80:48.15]Are you guys back from the ad?
[80:57.53]Is the ad done?
[80:58.03]I got it.
[81:20.66]That nearly killed me.
[81:22.51]Just wait till it's on hard.
[81:23.69]It's unbearable.
[81:26.09]I'm never gonna be able to do it.
[81:27.27]I remember when I was younger, I think I even asked my mother to help me do some of these things in this game.
[81:36.18]And she was like, I just, I can't do this, Jeremy.
[81:41.60]I don't understand.
[81:42.58]I can't do this.
[81:43.10]Just wait.
[81:43.46]You'll see.
[81:43.82]Alright.
[81:44.12]We got her back.
[82:19.68]Okay, let's go.
[82:25.93]Well, I just turned off pre-roll ads for... How long did it say?
[82:34.05]Like 20 minutes?
[82:35.71]That's like... Not a bad thing.
[82:44.32]Okay.
[82:44.78]Alright, here we go.
[82:46.16]You gotta go by glasses.
[82:47.36]So, glasses first.
[82:49.70]I thought she was gone.
[83:02.05]Alright, we're good.
[83:12.64]What is that?
[83:13.18]I can't tell what that is.
[83:15.32]This one.
[83:24.65]And then sunglasses.
[83:26.91]What?
[83:27.77]Oh, no, it's not.
[83:29.27]Alright, don't close the gate on them.
[83:32.41]What?
[83:32.69]Uh-oh.
[83:37.94]Wait, what's... Oh, there's one more of these.
[83:44.79]Well done, oh wise and trusted guide.
[83:48.72]If you run a few minutes of ads in a row, you can disable them for an hour.
[83:57.66]I really just hate running ads.
[84:02.09]Use the crystal filters to change the Zumbini's reflection.
[84:06.47]It will give them crystal slamming protection.
[84:13.70]Alright, I've got all 16.
[84:15.10]We're almost there.
[84:24.93]Okay.
[84:25.77]This one takes the most time, obviously.
[84:28.83]We have to get it right.
[84:29.55]Okay.
[84:46.73]I have to pee so bad.
[84:48.85]But I'm not peeing until I beat Zumbini's.
[84:53.45]At least get this group over.
[84:59.86]Oh, right here.
[85:04.08]Okay, next.
[85:17.64]I love that little bird sound, whatever it is.
[85:19.76]Like bats.
[85:25.99]Right here?
[85:33.13]An adult diaper?
[85:35.11]I don't trust that, honestly.
[85:36.93]I don't need it, but I don't trust it.
[85:45.60]I just don't trust it.
[85:46.48]An adult diaper to me is like, I don't know.
[85:49.20]I feel like I sometimes I do like a full 60 second piss.
[85:52.19]I don't think it would work.
[85:52.97]OK.
[85:57.73]Oh, here we go.
[86:20.55]60 second piss is easy.
[86:22.01]I don't think so.
[86:23.13]Spring?
[86:46.45]There's only two springs, so if it's a spring and it doesn't... Yeah, it's not gonna match.
[86:59.54]How much is 60 seconds to gallons?
[87:03.66]I don't... I don't know.
[87:12.27]Gallons?
[87:14.59]I wonder.
[87:15.01]I'll figure it out one day.
[87:40.41]I'm eating a whole tray of ice.
[87:41.99]Why are you doing that?
[87:45.52]Did you make ice popsicles?
[87:47.22]Because if you did, cool.
[87:49.62]But if you didn't, then what are you doing?
[87:51.60]Okay.
[88:07.49]See, this one takes the longest, but this is the patience.
[88:10.61]This is the patience part of the game.
[88:13.46]It's really easy to be like, ah, just let's go and hurry up, but you'll make a mistake.
[88:39.46]Bottom right, hurry up.
[88:46.51]I just did it.
[88:47.55]Okay.
[89:06.05]What is wrong with the stream tags?
[89:08.43]Um... He's having a fiber CCO at off-brand.
[89:14.47]Eats bugs.
[89:16.54]I don't know, because I don't... I don't... The tags just don't... I don't really care.
[89:28.40]Almost fucked it up.
[89:29.58]See?
[89:29.72]That's what happens when you rush.
[89:46.75]Grandma, how does the mail work?
[89:50.03]Um... Go look up, like, a science fucking video.
[89:54.61]I don't know.
[89:55.59]Like, I know, but I don't want to sit here and explain it.
[89:58.07]It's like, I don't know, it's a big, long, complicated process with a lot of moving parts.
[90:02.71]It's probably a YouTube video about, like, how does the mail get sorted and shipped?
[90:07.55]Why do you want me to tell you that?
[90:08.95]I don't know.
[90:15.39]Hey, dude, how does a male work?
[90:26.16]I don't know.
[90:39.66]You put it into the mailbox and the carrier picks it up, brings it to a sorting facility and sends it out with different carriers?
[90:49.32]Oh, look it up!
[90:59.80]Alright, I'm gonna mess this up.
[91:00.91]I have to pay attention.
[91:09.20]Okay, only ponytails can go this way.
[91:14.97]Or they die.
[91:17.59]So if you have a ponytail, you cannot go this way.
[91:21.99]You are dead.
[91:23.21]So all ponytails, please, line up at this one.
[91:33.12]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[91:34.22]That's not necessarily true.
[91:35.18]Hold on.
[91:39.49]Yes, it is.
[91:50.35]How much is this game?
[91:53.37]Um... I've owned it for a very long time.
[91:56.92]How long... I think it's like... 10 bucks?
[92:02.32]5 bucks?
[92:03.92]20 bucks?
[92:04.98]It can't be more than that.
[92:13.92]OK, so let's get this right, because I see a lot of bullshit over here.
[92:18.37]So if I take this person with the glasses and I have you go up here, you're going to go right up.
[92:24.45]You're going to pass this, you're going to pass this and you're going to be fine.
[92:35.51]So now, glasses goes this way.
[92:38.45]If I put glasses here again, it's gonna go right up and then get completely screwed up and die.
[92:45.55]So... It has to be somebody with... What about sunglasses?
[92:50.82]If I do sunglasses, we're good.
[92:52.80]So we have to alternate until there are no more glasses left.
[93:03.06]No?
[93:03.30]What do you mean no?
[93:05.31]What?
[93:05.51]No, that's right.
[93:05.99]I got it.
[93:08.77]So then I do... The glasses will go up and be fine.
[93:12.77]I'm fine.
[93:13.25]What do you guys chat?
[93:13.95]What are you on about?
[93:14.47]Have you gotten the Grimace Meal yet?
[93:17.33]No.
[93:17.51]I'll probably try it eventually here.
[93:23.09]I got it.
[93:23.47]Because now I'll do... The glasses will go up.
[93:26.76]And to the right.
[93:29.16]And then be fine.
[93:29.76]And then we do sunglasses.
[93:43.14]I didn't fuck it up, how?
[93:48.05]No, I got it.
[93:48.61]You guys are just gaslighting.
[93:50.99]Okay, now it doesn't matter.
[94:04.48]Now everybody can just go on it.
[94:06.11]I hope this is right.
[94:16.01]Yeah, it doesn't matter anymore.
[94:17.35]I got it.
[94:23.49]Alright.
[94:24.04]All 16 made it.
[94:26.40]Everybody died.
[94:33.44]Let's go.
[94:40.93]One died in the crystal.
[94:42.67]Ow.
[94:42.93]I like when he does the funny voice, yeah.
[94:46.81]I don't know if you can hear the audio whine.
[94:49.96]It's like.
[95:09.47]Got a house.
[95:09.93]Got a house.
[95:12.08]Trying to get some dwellings here.
[95:13.40]This clock tower.
[95:14.98]Cool.
[95:41.76]Building out the village.
[95:47.62]Okay.
[95:49.28]Still doing the journey.
[95:51.39]It's still on a pretty... We're still on easy.
[95:55.05]Let's try to speedrun after IP.
[95:56.35]I'll be right back.
[100:42.60]Give you a warning that the music was stopping.
[100:46.94]I saw a monkey ass, yeah.
[100:50.37]Yeah, I've seen a few monkey asses.
[100:54.53]You gone for a long time?
[100:57.25]Was I?
[101:04.47]I wasn't gone for that long.
[101:06.87]Well, I had to pee and then I had to refill my water.
[101:08.71]Beverage.
[101:11.29]Why did you say it like that?
[101:13.19]Why didn't you just say water?
[101:14.51]You said water and then pause and said beverage.
[101:16.25]Why did you pause?
[101:18.70]You could have just said water.
[101:21.30]What's in the water?
[101:21.82]A little bit of a tea powder drink thingy.
[101:30.16]Having it today.
[101:39.70]It's like, I fuck with you guys, and then I end up just fucking with myself.
[101:42.54]Alright, is this a good makeup here?
[101:59.75]I'm speedrunning.
[102:00.51]I'm gonna go as fast as I can now.
[102:02.19]Because I think after we do this next one, we should unlock the next difficulty.
[102:04.86]So let's go.
[102:05.50]I'm going.
[102:05.92]Doesn't matter what it is.
[102:06.46]I'll make it work.
[102:10.38]You want variety?
[102:11.05]Yeah.
[102:14.09]Hmm.
[102:16.01]I think this is pretty good.
[102:16.95]Maybe some more of the smaller eyes like this.
[102:24.48]Just make them all the same.
[102:28.72]I think you actually get softlocked if you do that.
[102:31.30]Oh.
[102:38.65]Because if one of the bridges, for instance, doesn't allow red noses and everybody has a red nose, they all die.
[102:43.40]Also, can we get a poll?
[102:48.70]Do you want me to skip the intro cutscenes for each little game?
[102:53.80]You know what I mean?
[102:56.40]Alright, let's go.
[102:57.58]Speedrun.
[103:09.61]Alright, it's gonna be shoes probably.
[103:11.39]Uh, we got pink shoes going up here.
[103:13.35]Is that correct?
[103:17.97]Looks pretty good.
[103:18.53]Alright, what about, um... No, that's not right.
[103:21.38]So what is it then?
[103:23.28]Okay, it could be... different eyes.
[103:28.66]Alright, what about... is it eyes?
[103:32.90]Might be.
[103:35.70]Looks good so far.
[103:36.64]Uh-huh.
[103:40.16]I think it's based on eyes.
[103:45.93]Oh.
[103:49.15]Is it not eyes?
[103:51.73]Hair?
[103:55.17]So what makes you able to go up here?
[103:59.78]Nose?
[104:00.56]Alright, it's noses.
[104:10.15]What?
[104:13.60]It's only pink allowed in the bottom?
[104:18.48]So many people are going on this first bridge.
[104:23.09]Okay.
[104:24.29]Well.
[104:29.25]I actually can't.
[104:29.93]I gotta be careful because...
[104:33.97]Alright, can yellow go here?
[104:35.91]Okay, I'm gonna, everyone's dead.
[104:38.94]They're all dead after this.
[104:41.04]Because, okay, I know you go up here.
[104:44.02]Does everybody go up here but pink?
[104:47.30]If I get it wrong, they're dead.
[104:50.20]Only pink at the bottom?
[104:53.78]What?
[104:55.49]That's weird.
[104:56.33]Okay, well, we made it.
[105:00.69]You did it!
[105:02.23]You saved them all!
[105:04.13]Are you dumb?
[105:05.97]No, that's a weird... Only two people go on the bottom bridge?
[105:09.59]That's weird.
[105:10.35]That doesn't usually happen that way.
[105:11.31]These stone guards have their rules, so do proceed with skill.
[105:15.82]Zumbini's one guard won't allow.
[105:18.90]The other guard surely will.
[105:24.06]You are dumb.
[105:26.24]Hey, I'll run another ad if you say that again.
[105:28.91]I'm not actually going to run another ad.
[105:30.61]Okay.
[105:35.83]Let's just go.
[105:38.23]Okay.
[105:38.37]Have a thought over here.
[105:39.77]Let's try noses.
[105:40.15]Okay.
[105:40.27]Is it all yellow noses?
[105:54.84]It's a nose playthrough this time.
[105:56.30]Alright.
[106:02.82]Okay.
[106:03.20]Blue noses.
[106:05.32]What's the problem?
[106:08.73]Hmm.
[106:09.73]The hair.
[106:25.59]enjoy yourself I misunderstood what this stream was going to be I thought you were going to drive around on one of those ice cleaners for skating rinks I mean that's that's funny alright hair who else has that spiky hair you do
[106:54.69]Alright, you... this way.
[106:57.45]Yep, yep, yep.
[106:58.67]Speedrun, go.
[106:59.63]Not a single person's been able to go up into her little... whatever.
[107:09.77]We can't go up in this area.
[107:10.65]Why?
[107:11.79]Hello.
[107:30.02]Have a good time.
[107:34.67]Huh?
[107:35.31]Oh, they're... Okay, right.
[107:37.57]We're good.
[107:40.65]Splendid!
[107:42.37]Say hi to Arno.
[107:44.43]Say hi to Otto?
[107:46.58]I'll say hi to Otto.
[107:47.62]...to this dusty wasteland until they meet Arno, the almost omnivorous, one very hungry pizza troll.
[107:59.43]Zamboni stream.
[108:02.10]Alright, still simple.
[108:06.16]Still basic.
[108:09.38]We're good.
[108:17.16]This formula starts to become impossible to... We have to go a little bit more detailed.
[108:22.68]But no cheese!
[108:36.91]Okay.
[108:38.91]Alright, so you like pepperoni and mushrooms.
[108:49.96]More, okay.
[108:51.96]Pepperoni, mushrooms, and peppers.
[109:05.09]You want them all?
[109:05.77]Alright, well, here you go.
[109:22.34]I think eventually you start making ice creams too for them, right?
[109:26.30]Spoiler, I know, but whatever, it's fun.
[109:36.56]Everything but cheese.
[109:46.98]Well done.
[109:48.80]You're adjusting to the trials of the journey.
[109:53.03]Rest up if you must.
[109:55.23]We're going down.
[109:55.93]I'm going down.
[109:58.11]The up is harder.
[109:59.07]You still have much in store for them.
[110:05.19]There's no sense leaving it up to chance.
[110:08.52]Lower the flings off.
[110:10.74]Okay, we know this one.
[110:11.84]Alright, so let's just get somebody to go forward.
[110:14.38]Alright, so Spring is, uh, heals?
[110:31.36]Can we match anything here?
[110:32.16]Alright.
[110:32.38]So we got, alright, these eyes.
[110:34.28]Alright.
[110:36.34]I would say the same, like three words a lot today.
[110:44.52]What about the hair?
[110:45.06]Alright.
[110:47.26]Yellow.
[110:48.22]Shit.
[110:48.60]Alright.
[110:50.41]So yellow noses are blue noses.
[110:58.08]Just take a guess here.
[110:59.50]Alright.
[111:00.16]Shit!
[111:00.52]Stop saying that!
[111:01.43]I'm like fucking in my own head.
[111:03.43]I can't.
[111:08.25]I can't help but I have to.
[111:09.43]It's like a filler word for my brain.
[111:15.79]So.
[111:22.07]It has to be these two.
[111:23.03]There's only two more yellow noses.
[111:26.26]Yeah.
[111:34.18]Hmm.
[111:45.71]This one?
[111:46.11]Uh-oh.
[111:47.95]There's almost no more room on the tree.
[111:58.48]Oh, it's pink shoes!
[112:00.98]Pink shoes.
[112:02.69]This one.
[112:07.53]Alright, this one's easy.
[112:29.50]I'm skipping, I know.
[112:32.48]I know, don't skip, don't skip.
[112:33.79]How could you skip Zumbini's intro cutscenes?
[112:35.77]I know, but we'll watch them again.
[112:41.26]Let's see if it's hair.
[112:44.18]It might be hair, it might be noses too.
[112:45.86]Nose.
[112:48.10]It looks like it's noses again.
[113:01.36]Alright, so if it's yellow noses, then... That's it?
[113:09.37]Green?
[113:27.14]The door opening noise is the same on the TF2 team selection screen.
[113:33.28]It is, you're right.
[113:36.38]It definitely is.
[113:40.64]You know that.
[113:42.60]Although I say that, but I've... I hear sounds in games and in movies and I go, I know where that's from.
[113:53.47]My favorite puzzle.
[113:57.92]right let's get us squared up okay so this is green so triangle yellow red so red some of the shape of triangle blue oh crap whoa what am I doing it's pink okay
[114:29.67]Yellow square?
[114:35.21]Yes!
[114:44.41]Yellow circle.
[114:50.78]What the fuck is this game laughing my ass off?
[114:55.86]Logical Journey of the Zumbinis.
[115:07.27]I don't want to run out of juice here.
[115:14.02]Circle.
[115:14.42]Red.
[115:14.98]Red triangle.
[115:33.70]Wait, what?
[115:34.88]Oh, shit.
[115:35.48]No, no, no, no, no.
[115:36.10]Triangle blue.
[115:38.54]Whoa, wait, what's happening?
[115:40.02]Blue, wait.
[115:41.28]Blue circle.
[115:42.16]I'm gonna, people are gonna die.
[115:44.06]People are dead.
[115:44.62]I have one shot left.
[115:50.60]It's pink diamond.
[115:56.72]I have enough for one more shot.
[115:57.95]It's pink diamond.
[116:03.50]Thank God.
[116:04.04]That was it.
[116:04.54]I would have lost.
[116:06.12]I almost just threw one easy.
[116:07.30]Would have been bad.
[116:09.45]Hip, hip, zumbine!
[116:15.71]Hip, hip, zumbine!
[116:29.43]Amazing indeed!
[116:32.31]Another relaxing campsite ready and waiting for Zoombinis!
[116:38.27]And they'll need their rest.
[116:40.59]The darkest, most dangerous part of the journey is yet to come!
[116:56.22]There are two other Zumbini's games that were apparently dog shit.
[116:59.96]But I want to play them.
[117:02.51]I never played them.
[117:03.85]Even when I was younger.
[117:10.11]They were good.
[117:13.81]How do they compare to the logical journey of the Zumbini's?
[117:17.50]Mountain Rescue is super good.
[117:19.12]Alright.
[117:19.82]I'm willing to try it.
[117:28.90]And then spring.
[117:32.98]This pace is so much better.
[117:33.94]Oh my, you've done exceptionally well.
[117:55.98]Carry on, carry on.
[118:01.42]This is way too scary.
[118:03.46]What are you talking about?
[118:11.39]Got it right off the bat.
[118:19.28]I got to go fast.
[118:20.03]I told you I was not going to just mess around right now.
[118:22.27]Here we go.
[118:22.75]Alright.
[118:24.19]Uh-huh.
[118:24.79]Uh-huh.
[118:25.49]Uh-huh.
[118:26.45]Uh-huh.
[118:28.17]Uh-huh.
[118:30.74]Uh-huh.
[118:52.28]I'm trembling and shivering and sweating because this game is so scary.
[118:59.55]Well, I don't know.
[119:01.29]I wonder how well you do with the back of cereal boxes.
[119:04.71]Because that's the same amount of fear-inducing imagery.
[119:09.46]So, I don't know what to tell you.
[119:22.26]Alright, we gotta go by noses first.
[119:23.86]Let's go red.
[119:26.16]Nose.
[119:31.19]Okay.
[119:37.11]Oops, okay.
[119:39.73]Um... Nope, that's wrong.
[119:56.59]How many Zoombinis do you think you could eat?
[120:02.77]I don't know how big Zoombinis are.
[120:07.00]I think they're really small.
[120:19.29]Why would I want to eat the Zoombinis?
[120:30.57]They look delicious.
[120:37.82]I'm not even going to give that a response because it was so unbelievably stupid.
[120:45.74]Okay.
[120:50.59]They look delicious.
[120:58.11]unbelievably out of bounds, okay?
[121:02.67]Alright?
[121:04.71]Alright?
[121:16.32]They look like candy.
[121:35.99]Gargamel?
[121:39.35]Is Gargamel from the Smurfs?
[121:46.98]Wait, so Gargamel's whole thing was he wanted to eat them.
[121:51.18]That was his whole villain shtick?
[121:52.70]Because I'm going to eat the Smurfs!
[121:58.40]What?
[121:58.74]Why?
[122:05.96]It wasn't about like world domination or something.
[122:07.98]It was he just wanted to eat them because he thought they looked like they would taste good.
[122:14.30]Because they have eternal life.
[122:18.59]The Smurfs live forever?
[122:20.69]No, they don't.
[122:21.33]The Smurfs do not live forever.
[122:23.01]They don't have eternal life.
[122:25.15]They live like as long as a crane fly.
[122:29.25]Like fucking four days.
[122:30.68]What are you talking about?
[122:44.30]No, dude.
[122:45.14]What about Papa Smurf?
[122:48.78]Have you not seen the movie?
[122:50.90]No, I've not seen any of the Smurf movies.
[122:55.74]I can't say I've witnessed any of the Smurf movies.
[123:07.75]I've seen some of the old Smurf cartoons from the 80s and 90s.
[123:15.08]But not any of the movies.
[123:16.32]When they went 3D, I haven't seen any of them.
[123:36.60]Where's the Zumbini lore button?
[123:38.02]Oh, this is going to mess me up.
[123:46.35]Didn't you play Smurfs Dance Party?
[123:50.59]Smurfs.
[123:51.63]Smurfs.
[123:52.43]Quests.
[123:54.15]Quests.
[123:54.57]I'm going to mess up your brain for a little while.
[123:58.78]Our language is so weird.
[124:01.90]Say quests.
[124:04.52]Quests.
[124:06.50]We make like a... Quests.

[124:41.53]That's just you?
[124:42.35]No, it's not.
[124:44.81]Quests.
[124:46.13]I'm gonna forget this stream by tomorrow, dude.
[125:05.67]I'm trying to figure out if that's, like, some kind of an insult or if that's just your, just like, I don't really care.
[125:11.34]Is that, was that like an insult?
[125:14.32]That sounded like an insult.
[125:16.64]I don't think that's what it was, though.
[125:18.10]I think it was just purely like, dude, I'm not gonna remember this tomorrow, like, you saying this shit.
[125:24.35]Was it an insult?
[125:27.97]Alright, be careful.
[125:35.24]Alright, if you have a red nose, the left side is always safe.
[125:48.83]If you have a red nose and you go on the right side, you will always die.
[125:53.33]Let's just get that out of the way.
[126:11.12]Alright, now for the rest of you.
[126:14.04]Everybody else has to go this way, but we gotta do this right.
[126:17.16]So, up.
[126:18.92]If you have, we have to alternate between the eyes and the glasses.
[126:26.90]So we want to do glasses first.
[126:30.81]Then these eyes, then glasses.
[126:32.63]Then glasses.
[126:36.91]Then eyes.
[126:47.32]Now everybody else should be safe.
[126:50.22]Yep, we're good.
[126:53.45]Uh-oh.
[126:54.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[127:00.82]I'm good.
[127:19.54]That's a full party.
[127:20.28]We need a report on the Smurf movie by the next stream.
[127:28.49]Okay.
[127:31.09]Do you want to give me homework?
[127:34.97]Would you like me to live tweet the Smurf movie?
[127:37.86]And when I say live tweet, I mean just write a bunch of notes about it.

[137:44.35]That looks better.
[137:45.93]Why is it so dark?
[138:00.68]I always have trouble capturing a browser window in OBS.
[138:04.24]I've got to have a new system for it.
[138:15.79]Turn on the facecam.
[138:17.28]No.
[138:22.44]No.
[138:28.48]Like, it won't show up on... I can't, like, grab it.
[138:33.20]It's, like, in a weird window.
[138:34.12]I don't get it.
[138:42.85]Why is it doing this?
[138:54.81]For some reason, every time I capture a window in OBS, it just, it just is like, oh, that window doesn't exist.
[138:59.07]You have to like search for it on the scene.
[139:03.05]It's weird.
[139:03.47]I don't know why it does this.
[139:09.62]Um, okay.
[139:12.44]Well, you can't see it, which is annoying.
[139:22.95]Why can't you see it?
[139:33.80]Why does it do this to me?
[139:39.98]Are you streaming naked?
[139:40.80]No.
[139:43.74]I need to get a different OBS.
[139:45.02]I've been using the same one for so long and I hate it.
[139:47.28]And I keep saying I want to change, but I just don't.
[139:50.83]Oh, hey, there it is.
[139:56.69]It showed up.
[139:59.89]You should be able to see it now.
[140:02.52]Yeah.
[140:02.72]Why?
[140:02.98]What the hell?
[140:03.40]What happened?
[140:03.86]That was annoying.

[140:14.93]I'm just going to go for it.

[140:21.73]Okay.
[140:23.07]Start quiz.
[140:26.91]Just 12 questions.
[140:28.99]You're at your cousin's wedding and no one is up and dancing yet.
[140:32.47]You... Grab your date and go out to the middle of the dance floor.
[140:38.51]Look awkwardly around and wait for someone else to start dancing.
[140:42.29]Wait for a slow song to come on and ask the hottie beside you to dance.
[140:48.81]Okay.
[140:50.87]Tell the DJ to put on the YMCA song.
[140:58.15]Honestly, it's probably this one.
[140:59.01]Because I never want to be the first one to go out there.
[141:04.78]I'm waiting to see, okay, alright everybody, we're putting the music on now, and two or three people go, then four or five, and then, alright, now, okay, now I'm ready to go.
[141:13.45]Yep, that one.
[141:16.09]Your car stalls...
[141:18.93]And you're in the middle of nowhere.
[141:20.05]Your cellphone is dead.
[141:21.91]So you find the car manual, study it, find what's wrong, and fix it.
[141:30.41]No.
[141:31.61]Way too flag the next car that you see coming.
[141:37.00]No.
[141:38.18]Look under the hood and immediately see the problem.
[141:40.30]You are on the road again in about 15 minutes.
[141:42.58]No.
[141:46.10]Relax, knowing it was a good idea to have a GPS put in the car with a lifeline to AAA.
[141:50.54]Done.
[141:51.52]I don't even need to read the other ones.
[141:56.04]You are so bored with your boredom, you decided it's time for a change and you pick out a bold red and love it.
[142:05.79]Are we talking about clothing?
[142:07.61]I read this wrong.
[142:17.95]Bored with your boredom pick out red.
[142:21.14]I was like what the fuck are they talking about?
[142:25.52]No, I don't want red in the bedroom.
[142:27.52]That's like too too much Find the brightest yellow you can and make your room into a sunshine Paradise.
[142:33.67]No, I don't know.
[142:34.33]I don't yellow either Go sophisticated and classy no
[142:40.07]Yeah.
[142:40.57]Rearrange the furniture, get some new sheets.
[142:42.83]Study about 20 p- no.
[142:43.59]We're just gonna- we're gonna move the bed to the other side of the room and get fresh sheets.
[142:49.33]Done.
[142:55.26]Okay.
[142:57.28]Your best friend tells you she's moving four hours away.
[143:00.40]You... make a scrapbook of all the good times you've had together and leave a bunch of blank pages to fill in with the days to come.
[143:09.15]Start crying immediately and plan for a major goodbye party.
[143:15.29]Thank God for Facebook.
[143:18.53]Vow to visit her.
[143:19.35]Your friendship is worth a long drive.
[143:21.39]We miss her terribly, but you know a friendship like yours can never be hurt by distance.
[143:28.54]Four hours is really not that far.
[143:31.54]Four hours?
[143:34.66]That's not...
[143:37.64]It's really not a huge... Start crying immediately.
[143:44.91]It's worth a long drive.
[143:45.95]Let's go.
[143:46.31]There's been a massive heat wave for about a week.
[143:50.39]Your most likely course of action is to go outside and just bake in the sun.
[143:55.93]Yep.
[143:56.81]This one.
[143:58.40]This one's comfortable, but... Personally, go check on your grandparents.
[144:05.84]Invite... No.
[144:07.20]This one.
[144:09.09]Which of these would most improve your life?
[144:10.89]Saving more money?
[144:12.23]Learning a new skill?
[144:13.93]Protecting yourself online?
[144:16.86]Taking a trip?
[144:18.28]Learning a new language?
[144:19.38]Or getting HBO?
[144:20.46]Uh, how to learn a new language makes, like, I don't know, sense to me.
[144:30.60]What language do you want to learn?
[144:33.26]It's probably Spanish.
[144:37.07]The best way to see a movie is... Grabbing your... Wait.
[144:41.12]Alert, alert, alert.
[144:42.20]Mod chat.
[144:42.66]You have to take a survey to get your results.
[144:44.42]They won't let you get your results.
[144:45.46]You have to take a survey.
[144:49.14]Oh.
[144:50.70]How long is the survey?
[144:51.62]Do I have to take a survey?
[145:02.19]I don't know, LOL.
[145:05.77]I didn't take it.
[145:07.80]You can skip it.
[145:10.88]I don't, but I don't want to, no, no, no.
[145:12.54]I don't, I'm not taking a survey.
[145:14.14]Is there a different one?
[145:15.14]Fuck.
[145:15.80]Oh no.
[145:22.74]Just, alright.
[145:24.14]Alright.
[145:24.36]Alright.
[145:24.62]Alright.
[145:24.98]Alright.
[145:27.52]Best way to see a movie is with a good friend going to the theater for a matinee.
[145:34.96]Grabbing your pals and jamming into the car to go to the drive-in.
[145:39.85]On your big screen TV with the surround sound.
[145:42.37]No, I don't like that.
[145:45.37]I watch movies.
[145:46.47]I'm such a shitty person to watch movies with.
[145:50.00]People probably hate sitting there with me and watching TV shows and stuff.
[145:52.88]I turn the volume way down.
[145:53.94]I hate loud-ass movies in TV.
[145:56.80]It just annoys me.
[145:59.71]I hate very loud movies and television.
[146:03.62]I want to be able to understand it, get a good grasp of what's going on.
[146:07.42]I mean, it's one of these.
[146:20.83]I'd say one, two, or three.
[146:24.40]It's probably one.
[146:26.66]Not the drive-in, though.
[146:28.14]I'm going to pick this one.
[146:33.20]You've been given the opportunity to choose one superpower to possess for 24 hours.
[146:36.25]You choose to go back in time, to be invisible, to be a speed reader, to fly, or to be a speed reader.
[146:47.59]Who clicks that?
[146:48.49]Which one of you clicked on that one?
[146:51.53]You can choose between speed reading books or flying.
[146:54.86]I think time travel would be interesting.
[147:01.96]Your sister needs you to look after her three kids for the weekend.
[147:04.98]You rent a bunch of movies and make popcorn.
[147:08.59]Take them to the museum to see dinosaur bones.
[147:11.33]That's pretty cool.
[147:13.07]Take them to the fair and let them eat as much cotton candy as they want.
[147:17.65]Set up a tent in the backyard and tell them not too spooky stories around a campfire.
[147:24.58]Spend the weekend getting to know them better and are sad when they leave.
[147:33.97]I want to tell you it's this one, but realistically it's this one.
[147:38.57]I want to pretend like it would be this one.
[147:42.91]But we all know it's this one.
[147:47.21]You go to an amusement park with the gang.
[147:49.05]Your favorite part of the whole day is... Crashing and smashing on the bumper boats.
[147:54.97]Screaming until your voice is gone on the scariest roller coasters.
[147:57.71]You hate them, but you love them.
[148:00.12]Going on the ferris wheel and looking for your house from the top.
[148:04.00]Taking pictures and just hanging out with your friends.
[148:05.44]Playing games and winning a stuffed animal for your crush.
[148:11.42]Not too much movement, especially if you've eaten during the day.
[148:15.87]This one, but I don't... Screaming?
[148:17.38]No, I don't scream on it.
[148:18.32]I'm completely silent.
[148:19.92]Anybody else silent roller coaster enjoyers?
[148:25.80]Anybody else just kind of sit there with a stone, just cold face?
[148:31.28]Just moving and... I'm not a woohoo hands up kind of guy.
[148:37.96]I am a internalize this and enjoy this.
[148:42.39]I don't like make any noise.
[148:43.33]I mean, that's not true.
[148:47.97]Sundays were meant for shutting the world out.
[148:53.18]It's just me time.
[148:55.68]Crafting and creating masterpieces.
[148:57.52]Going to church.
[148:59.24]Shopping and gabbing with your best friends.
[149:01.86]Catching up on housework.
[149:16.19]I mean, it's definitely just
[149:18.58]I mean, if it's the me time, right?
[149:20.12]Sunday?
[149:22.76]Sunday, I mean, I want to think of, like, okay, Sunday.
[149:25.47]I want to relax.
[149:27.47]I want to hang out.
[149:29.07]Maybe catch up on housework.
[149:30.59]No.
[149:31.71]Probably this one.
[149:35.09]You invite a bunch of friends to go to the mall.
[149:36.93]When you are there, you see someone you totally forgot to invite.
[149:40.81]You...
[149:42.64]Call her later to say you are an idiot and you're sorry.
[149:46.34]Call out her name and beckon for her to come over.
[149:50.16]Ask her to join you and apologize for forgetting her.
[149:53.32]Don't know what to do, she walks by and you just look the other way.
[149:59.25]Gasp and duck behind a display and stay hidden until she disappears.
[150:07.47]Well, there needs to be more context here.
[150:11.48]You invite a bunch of friends to go to the mall.
[150:16.01]When you were there, you see someone you forgot to invite.
[150:19.33]Is this a friend or just a person I know?
[150:22.11]That's incredibly important.
[150:25.39]When you see someone you totally forgot to invite.
[150:28.41]If it's a friend, how often do I see this person?
[150:32.38]Do I hang out with this person a lot?
[150:35.06]Is this a friend that you see, like, once every few months?
[150:38.34]Is this a friend that's always, you know, every day?
[150:40.38]Is this a daily friend?
[150:42.40]Is this a monthly friend?
[150:43.33]Is this, like, a every six to twelve months you see this person somewhere?
[150:47.37]This is really important, and I don't know which one it is.
[150:49.61]I'm gonna treat this like it is a, like, daily friend, like a friend that you see a lot.
[151:04.05]It's probably this one.
[151:07.57]And I would be like, hey!
[151:10.63]Hey!
[151:11.89]Come over here!
[151:12.77]What the hell?
[151:13.51]Were you serious?
[151:18.15]I'd be like, I didn't think you... I thought you were going to be busy today.
[151:21.51]I didn't... I didn't know you were going to be here.
[151:23.57]Yeah, whatever.
[151:26.94]You just had a very stressful day at work.
[151:30.24]A very stressful day.
[151:37.75]You are looking forward to finally getting home and relaxing.
[151:39.95]When you get there, you write in your journal for an hour and get all your worries out on paper.
[151:51.43]Call up a friend and fill her in on the nastiness of your day.
[151:55.45]Pull on your sweats and do some Pilates.
[152:00.95]Yep.
[152:02.57]This one right here.
[152:04.00]Put on some soothing music.
[152:05.28]Get some vanilla-scented bubble bath going.
[152:07.92]Yep.
[152:09.14]Take off the music, though.
[152:11.98]Alright, are we ready?
[152:12.76]I don't want you to see it until I do.
[152:40.27]What?
[152:51.16]You are clumsy, Smurf.
[152:53.84]You are so loved by your friends that they find your constant silliness enduring.
[152:58.00]You definitely can act goofy at times, but underneath that armor of humor, you're actually quite a deep thinker.
[153:03.17]In a word, you are fun.
[153:15.60]Okay.
[153:16.72]How would, why would I have gotten, how did I answer clumsy stuff?
[153:32.97]Okay.
[153:34.65]Well, that was the Smurf quiz.
[153:36.01]That was fun.
[153:47.35]You're the main character of the Smurfs movie.
[153:55.03]How do you feel?
[153:55.61]I feel like I want to read the rest of the Smurfs.

[154:51.18]Even Popper Smurf seems confused by his behavior.
[154:54.73]By the end of the movie, two female Smurfs from the Lost Village join him in his bizarre habit.
[154:59.17]I fucking got a spoiler.
[155:02.57]How am I ever going to do the homework now?
[155:06.47]Karate Smurf.

[155:41.96]And the clothes of a Dutch mill operator.
[155:48.53]Smurf moose?

[155:55.52]I didn't know the Smurfs were that intricate.
[156:13.91]Midlife Crisis Smurf.
[156:24.36]Well, that's all of them.
[156:29.10]Okay, well back to the thing we were just doing.
[156:33.12]I did not know the Smurfs were that intricate.
[156:38.07]Interesting, interesting stuff.
[156:39.19]Okay.
[156:39.97]Okay.
[156:44.21]I will watch the first Smurfs movie.
[156:50.97]I'll come back to you with a detailed report of how it went.
[157:00.76]Let's go.
[157:08.41]Table eating smurf.
[157:11.57]I'm really curious how that works.
[157:13.20]Alright, so this one is harder.
[157:15.14]We got to be prepared for this.
[157:49.06]Let's just start simple.
[157:51.38]Is it the... Alright, looks like spring?
[157:57.95]No, it's hair.
[157:58.81]It's definitely hair.
[158:03.85]Oh, fuck, it's not.
[158:04.63]No, no, no, get off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off.
[158:06.82]I can't, I can't cancel it.
[158:11.30]His eyes.
[158:25.54]Hmm.
[158:26.48]Okay.
[158:27.54]Let's try down here.
[158:31.05]Good.
[158:32.11]So far so good.
[158:36.73]Oh my god.
[158:43.72]We're good?
[158:44.74]Yep.
[158:45.26]I think this should be set now.
[158:46.80]Alright.
[158:47.28]We're good.
[158:48.08]Made it.
[158:56.64]Oh, whoops.
[159:01.67]Okay.
[159:13.98]You did it!
[159:15.52]You saved them all!
[159:19.21]How many times will he repeat playing this game on multiple streams?
[159:21.97]This guy... Is this game he's going to play in his deathbed?
[159:34.26]I mean, I've played this once on stream.
[159:40.84]In 2017, I played this for two or three hours tops.
[159:44.81]You've never seen this game ever again since or before that.
[159:51.19]Here we go again.
[159:53.19]What did we do to deserve this?
[159:56.29]OK.
[159:56.81]Remember, it's harder.
[160:00.38]Don't be shy.
[160:01.82]Let's go spring.
[160:05.52]OK.
[160:05.66]It might be noses.
[160:10.38]OK, it might be hair.
[160:12.87]Is it hair?
[160:18.67]Oh shit.
[160:20.25]Not all doors are open to you.
[160:23.81]What do I do?
[160:27.75]Is that the only person that can go in there?
[160:30.61]Glasses?
[160:33.48]What do I do?
[160:34.72]Nope.
[160:40.66]Okay.
[160:47.39]This way.
[160:50.23]Okay.
[160:52.67]So what is the difference between these two?
[160:54.31]To have you go all the way up here.
[161:02.38]You don't like the nose, maybe.
[161:03.92]Okay, let's just see what happens if I go this way.
[161:14.16]Okay.
[161:14.98]Let's try yellow nose this way.
[161:19.25]Okay.
[161:19.47]I think this is good.
[161:25.08]Maybe it is noses.
[161:32.16]One of the chosen few.
[161:34.44]No.
[161:36.79]What's wrong?
[161:41.01]Step in.
[161:42.05]Move it.
[161:44.01]What the hell?
[161:47.07]This way.
[161:49.03]How many times has he played this game today?
[161:58.37]I started it three hours ago and I'm still here.
[162:00.59]What the hell?
[162:03.80]Do go in.
[162:20.08]Okay.
[162:35.80]Welcome.
[162:36.48]Alright, green nose.
[162:39.10]Green and red nose.
[162:40.52]I think you can go this way.
[162:42.22]Uh oh.
[162:44.40]Uh uh.
[162:49.88]You gonna let me in?
[162:51.30]Why?
[162:51.58]Hey!
[162:51.68]I'll get it, I gotta get it.
[162:52.62]This way.
[162:53.18]You better let me in.
[163:20.33]Away you go.
[163:21.61]You've done cool.
[163:29.58]I knew they could do it.
[163:33.08]Alright, this is a higher difficulty pizza one.
[163:35.33]When it comes to these finicky eaters, one troll's poison is another troll's pizza.
[163:41.77]Pizza for lunch and snack and dinner and dessert, baby would satisfy me.
[163:52.19]New character.
[163:54.07]This is where it gets hard.
[164:02.29]So there is ice cream now.
[164:05.06]So... Here's the deal.
[164:09.22]We're gonna go... Just this.
[164:14.50]Because we want to see if either one of them will eat whipped cream.
[164:17.78]There's stuff on that I don't like.
[164:21.39]I'd appreciate more toppings.
[164:23.15]Okay, so she wants the whipped cream and the cherry, but he does not.
[164:30.33]So we're going to start with her.
[164:32.94]What about sprinkles?
[164:40.26]Something on that I don't like.
[164:44.12]Okay, no sprinkles.
[164:54.89]What about pineapple?
[164:56.55]Okay.
[165:15.87]So you want more than that.
[165:18.83]What about that?
[165:24.68]Something Moscow.
[165:27.36]Some of those toppings are distasteful.
[165:29.54]OK, so we have.
[165:34.16]I got plenty.
[165:34.78]I got plenty of space.
[165:40.48]That's gotta be it.
[165:48.31]things wrong okay so it has to be mushrooms something on that I don't like
[166:06.68]Hmm, little pizza makers.
[166:10.00]There it is.
[166:10.48]Alright, we're good.
[166:12.23]So, you do not want this.
[166:13.55]So, we're going to have to just go... And there's no cheese option either.
[166:16.99]How about just... How about we just go mushroom?
[166:20.83]Make it easy.
[166:22.98]Make it simple.
[166:25.62]Something must go...
[166:36.61]Do you just want a sauce pizza?
[166:38.07]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[166:47.51]So, let's do... I think this is gonna be... Did he just punch me in the face?
[166:55.52]He just punched me in the face.
[166:59.50]He punched me in the face.
[167:00.42]Okay.
[167:01.84]Okay.
[167:11.41]Oh!
[167:11.75]Sorry, bye.
[167:25.22]Uh-oh.
[167:26.64]Okay.
[167:28.80]So, you don't like mushrooms.
[167:31.65]This is the pizza that you want.
[167:33.39]Unless you don't want pineapple, but you want sprinkles on the ice cream.
[167:45.30]There's stuff on that I don't like.
[167:47.88]You piece of shit.
[167:49.04]He's gonna kill somebody else.
[167:52.58]He's gonna kill another.
[167:53.48]Shit.
[167:58.69]Alright, well, we did it.
[168:04.37]Thank you, thank you.
[168:07.07]It's all good.
[168:14.52]We lost too, but that's... We'll be fine.
[168:31.55]my that was challenging but you did it you are a bright one oh we can't go we can't go forward we have to store everybody I can't move forward without 16. we gotta go back
[169:07.03]I can see how you shaped your personality, though.
[169:13.82]What is this freakish little game?
[169:15.54]That's a weird way to put it.
[169:36.12]Alright, let's go.
[169:43.68]How about here?
[169:50.16]Is it glasses or I mean, these are pretty much the same.
[169:52.18]Let's try glasses.
[169:57.45]Nope.
[169:59.87]It's probably hair or feet.
[170:06.36]Try hair.
[170:08.80]Well, could be either one.
[170:09.86]Let's try feet.
[170:13.23]OK, I think that's correct.
[170:16.13]Yep.
[170:19.95]Uh oh.
[170:21.37]Maybe it is hair.
[170:29.58]So OK, it's hair.
[170:31.68]Is it hair though?
[170:32.50]All the same shoes?
[170:35.61]Slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down.
[170:39.55]I'm good, I got it.
[170:40.61]Okay.
[171:06.27]OK, I hope I don't get this wrong because.
[171:09.69]Did you add that as an emote?
[171:10.83]That's fine.
[171:16.84]Alright, got it.
[171:20.54]You've done quite well.
[171:30.64]The point of the game is to try to get as many Zumbinis to the Zumbini-ville town without losing any of them.
[171:46.77]But you will.
[171:47.99]Let's go pink noses this way, see if it works.
[171:58.62]Uh-huh.
[172:03.18]Go on.
[172:05.05]Blue.
[172:06.27]Alright.
[172:06.55]Blue noses.
[172:11.05]One of the chosen few.
[172:13.19]What about green noses this way?
[172:15.83]No.
[172:17.97]The pass is closed.
[172:20.99]Alright.
[172:22.11]What about this way?
[172:26.24]Not all doors are open to you.
[172:35.50]This is almost the exact same character, so, uh... Let's just assume that this is going to get through.
[172:42.19]Assume this one will get through as well.
[172:47.05]No.
[172:48.45]Those eyes.
[172:51.92]It's not hair.
[172:52.78]It's not feet.
[172:54.62]It's not nose.
[172:55.20]It's eyes.
[172:55.54]Hmm.
[173:03.17]Step right up.
[173:04.92]Any more glasses up this way?
[173:15.26]Why is this one over here?
[173:16.16]Oh, blue nose, right?
[173:18.72]The blue nose does it.
[173:25.17]Okay.
[173:25.43]I think they all just go this way.
[173:34.27]Yeah, we're good.
[173:36.45]We're good.
[173:37.89]Don't mess up the pizza stuff now.
[174:05.27]make me a pizza alright same deal we're gonna go just like this some of those toppings are distasteful they both don't like pineapple they're both hyper intelligent beings hyper intelligence alright what about this

[175:11.49]Maybe she'll just want this.
[175:18.72]Okay.
[175:22.22]So you don't like any of this shit.
[175:35.36]You want a plain pizza?
[175:38.16]It's possible.
[175:39.32]Sometimes it happens.
[175:52.03]You might just want a plain sauce pizza.
[175:56.86]Well, find out right now.
[176:03.85]Okay.
[176:07.01]And nobody had to die.
[176:21.28]Is it why are you moaning in the background?
[176:23.32]Where do you hear that?
[176:25.73]What are you talking about?
[176:32.25]I'm not going up until I have to.
[176:52.54]This one might be my favorite game besides the pizza one.
[176:56.28]This is my favorite non-pizza related minigame.
[177:07.82]Do any of these match?
[177:09.03]Alright, so it's a green nose.
[177:13.59]And that's it.
[177:14.29]So we single out the green noses.
[177:16.43]And this one looks very different.
[177:19.31]There it is.
[177:19.77]So it's the green nose, this hair.
[177:33.01]And pink shoes.
[177:35.41]Green nose.
[177:36.49]This hair.
[177:38.32]And this is it right here.
[177:39.32]No, it's not.
[177:40.40]Yes, it is.
[177:53.36]Breaking news.
[177:54.00]Jerma's favorite non-pizza related minigame revealed.
[177:57.21]I got deleted by Nightbot.
[177:59.17]Sorry.
[178:01.01]Used too many capital letters, I think.
[178:04.00]Alright.
[178:11.22]So green nose.
[178:14.76]Different hair, though.
[178:18.94]This one?
[178:22.66]Nope.
[178:27.27]So it's pink shoes and green nose.
[178:32.19]This one.
[178:38.94]That is really loud for me.
[178:39.98]Hopefully it's not loud for you.
[178:51.02]This entire game is food mode.
[178:54.56]Yeah, that's fine.
[178:56.90]Let's just go for shoes.
[179:07.52]No.
[179:09.16]Is it glasses?
[179:12.38]It might be nose or glasses.
[179:13.54]Let's try glasses with a different color nose.
[179:18.20]It's noses.
[179:19.34]Always do noses first.
[179:20.20]What the hell am I doing?
[179:20.82]Am I dumb?
[179:25.42]Am I... Am I dumb?
[179:26.86]Why would I not start with noses?
[179:40.00]I love this song.
[180:06.82]Hey, you're ready to snooze.
[180:08.98]Dream a little dream.
[180:12.94]Are you going to play Final Fantasy 16?
[180:16.90]I can tell you.
[180:18.76]The answer to that question is yes.
[180:22.12]I'm going to play it at launch and guess what?
[180:27.16]I'm going to be sponsored to play it again.
[180:34.19]Let's fucking go.
[180:53.97]You love saying let's go.
[180:55.73]No, I just think saying let's go makes me more relatable.
[181:00.78]So I try to throw it in there every now and again.
[181:05.59]Is it working?
[181:09.10]Alright, red.
[181:17.72]Uh, triangle.
[181:27.83]And you say, let's go Zumbini gang.
[181:31.47]That is like a YouTube video.
[181:35.07]I want to do like a tuber intro.
[181:38.11]I could if you wanted me to.
[181:43.35]I just got this incredible urge for Tabasco habanero sauce.
[181:48.89]I had this immediate urge to just eat it.
[181:56.34]It was immediate.
[182:00.78]a pink circle wait oh I thought I clicked circle alright circle what is it pink star no it's pink triangle no pink square
[182:28.97]How do you pronounce this?
[182:30.99]Pico de Gallo.
[182:35.35]You can put your head down in shame now, because you thought I was going to say it wrong.
[182:46.58]Alright, blue diamond.
[182:50.16]Nope.
[182:51.50]Well, blue star.
[182:55.50]Blue circle.
[182:59.65]Do you want me to do like a hot sauce?
[183:02.03]A hot sauce.
[183:03.39]Burn my whole face.
[183:06.24]Blast.
[183:07.80]Oh, this one is so hot.
[183:09.70]You want to do that?
[183:12.02]I'll do it.
[183:13.80]Okay.
[183:37.65]Ketchup is too hot for you.
[183:43.50]Actually, that's kind of true in a lot of cases.
[183:46.36]Ketchup can kind of be a little too much.
[183:47.52]Not spicy, but like annoying.
[184:04.30]not spicy I'm just saying ketchup ketchup can kind of be annoying on food sometimes I wouldn't want ketchup on let's say like I don't know I'm trying to think of what like would be kind of weird on it's a little too um tangy and acidic strange carvings I'd say the same thing about a tabasco sauce I wouldn't want that on everything it's a little too harsh
[184:36.34]What is this even telling me?
[184:38.86]These hairstyles?
[184:40.08]I think these are hairstyles.
[184:47.73]Uh... Dun dun dun dun dun.
[185:08.13]Can you eat a Carolina Reaper whole on stream for the haters?
[185:15.22]I would want to, like, eat a bowl of soup for the haters.
[185:20.20]You understand that?
[185:20.62]That would make the haters happy.
[185:23.36]Why would I do that for the haters?
[185:28.00]That would make the haters be very pleased.
[185:33.02]The haters would be very unhappy if I was just eating soup on stream and I was, like, having a good time and normal.
[185:39.21]What do you mean?
[185:39.89]For the haters?
[185:42.28]Me being like... Like on stream is like, yeah, yeah, fuck you.
[185:47.96]I fucking hate you.
[185:48.98]Fucking I hate him.
[185:49.78]Like I hope he fucking gets hurt.
[185:50.87]What do you mean for the haters?
[186:06.77]When are you going to eat soup on stream?
[186:08.47]I don't know.
[186:09.03]Never.
[186:11.69]You should stream soup then for the haters.
[186:13.39]Okay.
[186:22.78]I can't tell what hairstyle that is.
[186:24.24]Alright.
[186:24.64]What about, where's the soup tier list?
[186:40.48]I want to do the frozen food tier list.
[186:45.80]You know what?
[186:46.16]Let's just stop talking about it and get a... Let's get a plan for it.
[186:50.80]Here's what I want to do.
[186:55.36]I'll talk to the mods.
[186:57.30]And we will get a system where we can figure out what the best frozen foods are.
[187:05.07]I'll get a bunch of them.
[187:06.87]And we'll do it.
[187:17.72]We'll talk after the stream.
[187:20.58]So you can recommend, like, oh, hey, you gotta get the Stouffer's fucking meat and potatoes meal.
[187:27.41]Right?
[187:28.99]You're never gonna do this?
[187:29.83]Oh, I will.
[187:31.39]I will.
[187:44.16]Like, TV dinner?
[187:45.36]Yeah.
[187:46.38]Just like frozen meals.
[187:48.74]Frozen foods.
[187:51.22]Maybe like three or four from each major brand.
[187:53.42]Here's the thing.
[187:58.52]I want to make sure that I can take at least enough from each one.
[188:05.64]And to be able to save the rest of it to eat later.
[188:07.84]Or if it's gross, you know, obviously I'm not going to keep it.
[188:12.51]I think frozen meals is where we start.
[188:31.97]Jimmy Dean breakfast bowl.
[188:34.35]Okay.
[188:39.52]Fish sticks.
[188:40.08]When are you going to do the baby food tier list?
[188:44.76]Your microwave is going to be working overtime.
[188:53.10]Can you explain this minigame for the haters?
[188:56.30]Um... Yeah, that's fine.
[189:03.00]So in this game mode, you have to match the Zumbini with one of the mirrors.
[189:08.42]And there are five to six fake Zumbinis up here to throw you off.
[189:14.71]So I have to take one of my Zumbinis and match it to this one.
[189:41.75]I can't like do this.
[189:44.75]Why am I having so much trouble with this?
[190:05.59]Oh, I don't know why this guy didn't exist up there.
[190:15.20]A lot of pink shoes.
[190:28.65]You sound like you're really bad at bottle flipping.
[190:34.73]Yeah, I am.
[190:36.40]Actually, I never even tried it.
[190:37.32]I might be good at it.
[190:43.06]I've never tried.
[190:43.72]Do a bottle flipping stream.
[191:02.48]Is this game an analogy for children's journey through life to reach God and eternal Paradise?
[191:06.24]Um... Hey, media, you can interpret, you know, certain ways, however you feel like you interpret the media.
[191:19.43]I interpret this as... The Struggle to Relocate.
[191:34.47]the hardships that come with relocating and man's constant struggle with who we are and what we're what we're doing on this planet
[192:04.23]and our ability as humans to overcome anything.
[192:12.74]That's what I think it is.
[192:13.64]That's how I believe it is.
[192:25.67]No, it's not just a fun game for kids about matching puzzles.
[192:40.73]Dope.
[192:52.16]You got that from ChatGPT.
[192:57.18]Does ChatGPT even know who the Zoombinis are?
[193:10.46]You should ask it.
[193:12.12]I've never used ChatGPT, I just hear about it.
[193:14.50]Do you want to know the fastest way to make me never do anything?
[193:31.84]Have the thing that is something to use have any kind of account sign up beforehand.
[193:39.90]And I just won't use it.
[193:41.56]Ever.
[193:44.50]The Zumbinis are a fictional group of small blue creatures who star in a series of educational puzzle games.
[193:49.25]First game, Logical Journey of the Zumbinis.
[193:51.45]Okay, well they know.
[193:52.93]It's just a search thing, isn't it?
[194:08.03]It is not just a search thing.
[194:09.55]Well, I mean, okay, if you type into chat GPT, what are the Zumbinis, it's going to find it.
[194:14.35]It's going to figure it out.
[194:16.13]You didn't write, what are the Zumbinis' favorite foods?
[194:20.64]Or like, how do we stop the Zumbinis?
[194:23.56]Or that's, you're asking it a very simple question.
[194:44.46]You stop by not playing.
[194:57.95]You killed one?
[194:59.19]What?
[194:59.37]No, I didn't.
[195:01.29]Oh shit, I killed one.
[195:03.17]I wasn't paying attention.
[195:04.81]I wasn't paying attention.
[195:11.05]I was looking over at chat.
[195:12.25]I was talking to you guys.
[195:23.72]I was talking to you guys.
[195:24.76]I wasn't even looking at the game.
[195:26.36]I was just hanging out.
[195:33.41]There is no need or reason to stop the Zumbinis, as they are fictional characters from a series of educational games.
[195:39.69]The Zumbinis exist solely within the context of those games and do not pose any real-world threat.
[195:46.28]However, if you're referring to a specific challenge or obstacle within the Zumbini games that you're having trouble with, I'd be happy to help you with strategies or solutions to overcome it.
[195:55.80]Just let me know which part you're struggling with and I'll do my best.
[196:05.84]Alright.
[196:14.91]How many people?
[196:15.47]There's like 17,000 people here.
[196:17.69]You are training the language learning model right now.
[196:22.49]People are going to start getting Zumbini lore in their random fucking generations they do.
[196:29.45]ChatGPT is just gonna think that the Zoombinis are incredibly important and just start putting them in other places.
[196:48.17]Well, they are important, so...
[196:58.15]I can't believe I killed one.
[197:00.79]Can you please turn on the mic camera?
[197:17.28]I haven't showered today and I'm naked.
[197:19.90]So no.
[197:32.75]Alright, let's do this one.
[197:34.65]This one has got shoes in the mix now.
[197:44.49]So if shoes go... pink shoes go up this way, they always will bump that way.
[197:49.54]And then be safe.
[197:51.10]If pink shoes go this way, they will always go this way.
[197:57.20]And then they always die.
[197:58.66]So if you have pink shoes, you have to go this way.
[198:01.42]There is no other option.
[198:12.11]Wait.
[198:12.25]Yeah, okay, that's right.
[198:45.24]OK.
[198:50.04]And now what?
[198:58.49]So it doesn't really.
[198:59.51]OK, what about hair?
[199:00.19]So this hair is going to go up this way.
[199:02.99]It'll go all the way up.
[199:05.51]Down.
[199:05.89]Alright, so no matter what.
[199:09.11]Hair has to go this way.
[199:11.91]Wait, now everybody dies if they go that way.
[199:13.73]So we have to alternate.
[199:18.40]So as it stands right now, this has to go... This is right.
[199:27.23]Wait, hold on.
[199:30.61]If you have one of these hairs, you go up.
[199:35.51]Up.
[199:36.81]And to the right, down, up.
[199:39.43]Alright, so, hold on.
[199:40.74]I'm gonna fuck this up.
[199:43.46]I think this is correct.
[199:46.14]Did you play Vinny in Street Fighter?
[199:52.02]I mean, it would be an absolute fucking massacre.
[199:54.10]I don't know.
[199:54.82]I don't think that's a... Probably not a good idea.
[199:57.56]It would be an absolute massacre.
[200:12.19]I'm telling him you said that.
[200:16.05]I'm talking about me losing before you go tattletale on me.
[200:23.01]really wow okay alright so now I have to go up right down up okay so if I put this person with his hair that's correct then we do the this hair and this should be fine right I believe that's correct still have to worry about this so now
[200:58.45]Okay, you can go.
[200:58.99]And then... I think I fucked it up.
[201:30.50]Game sounds are too loud.
[201:33.53]Might be a one guy, but I'll do it.
[201:35.65]Is it a one guy?
[201:53.02]Turn it down a little bit.
[201:53.74]Are you slipping on a milkshake?
[202:05.39]I wish.
[202:05.75]You wearing a Star Wars shirt today?
[202:18.18]No, not today.
[202:19.14]Can we get to 100 Zumbinis in Zumbiniville?
[202:40.80]We're definitely going to get to 100.
[202:42.40]There's no way we won't.
[202:46.07]Ooh, what's this?
[202:47.93]Swimming pool.
[202:58.78]They got a pool now.
[203:03.78]Okay.
[203:04.92]Things have gotten harder this way.
[203:12.81]There's 60 here.
[203:23.20]Okay, let me ask you.
[203:24.48]Should we continue to do just the journey and bring more people?
[203:27.72]Or do you want to see how hard this game is because we've been playing it for three hours?
[203:30.48]What do you think?
[203:37.12]Let's get a poll up.
[203:38.54]You want to do the hard stuff and we'll play some hard minigames and then see where we are?
[203:43.96]Journey or go to hard?
[203:54.16]I'm seeing a lot of hard.
[203:57.32]Yeah, this is actually almost impossible for me on some of these.
[204:06.06]You wouldn't last a day on hard.
[204:07.76]I know I won't.
[204:09.34]They're actually really hard.
[204:14.13]Alright, so let's do very, very hard for pizza.
[204:18.15]Because everyone wants to see that.
[204:20.97]Let's go.
[204:25.06]So there are three.
[204:36.81]You won't last a minute playing this game on hard.
[204:42.16]That's not what he said.
[204:42.88]Oops.
[204:48.46]Okay, so... We already have some things they don't like.
[204:55.13]I don't know if it's cheese.
[204:57.59]Sometimes it's hard to tell.
[205:00.25]So.
[205:02.19]Somebody doesn't like mushrooms, sprinkles, or cheese.
[205:07.68]I'm gonna go pineapple.
[205:10.20]Plain.
[205:10.58]Go.
[205:11.02]Okay.
[205:11.58]Alright, so let's work on hers.
[205:17.17]So we got pineapple and cheese.
[205:20.39]Is that good?
[205:36.68]Getting there.
[205:37.53]They all don't like sprinkles, apparently.
[205:41.41]She likes cheese.
[205:42.11]So, she doesn't want sprinkles.
[206:07.21]What about a cherry?
[206:09.99]Alright.
[206:14.47]So, you... Alright.
[206:16.12]Alright.
[206:18.46]Alright.
[206:19.10]It's not pepperoni.
[206:38.02]It could be mushrooms.
[206:48.17]Got it.
[206:48.37]So... What do they actually want?
[206:52.71]Let's just go chocolate sauce.
[207:09.78]more toppings start oh something's wrong okay well I don't care I got one okay so I don't he didn't like cheese did he doesn't want pepperoni doesn't want sprinkles he didn't like the pineapple okay wait but what about the mushrooms down here what about cheese and mushrooms and shit

[207:46.03]No, he didn't like cheese.
[207:48.83]Okay.
[207:49.35]I don't think he likes cheese.
[207:50.35]That's going to be it.
[208:15.40]What?
[208:25.00]What the hell do you want?
[208:25.92]Do you just- what?
[208:36.57]Do you just want a cherry?
[208:38.03]This is a fucked up meal.
[208:47.21]Well, maybe not actually take a tomato based pie.
[208:49.85]No.
[208:52.04]Something on that's not good for me.
[208:54.94]What does he want?
[209:05.14]Doesn't want cherry.
[209:06.66]Doesn't like peppers.
[209:07.46]Doesn't like mushrooms.
[209:08.26]Doesn't want cheese.
[209:10.20]Is it pineapple?
[209:14.09]Didn't he say, ew, yucks?
[209:16.37]No, he doesn't like anything.
[209:18.99]Maybe it's just cheese.
[209:19.89]Oh.
[209:28.12]Kill the log?
[209:39.47]Alright, so you want pepperoni and chocolate sauce.
[209:44.60]That should be it.
[209:47.08]Yep.
[209:52.14]I have no idea what this guy wants.
[209:53.64]I don't think he wants any ice cream stuff.
[210:12.40]Let's check it.
[210:13.44]I have three or... I feel like four more.
[210:15.89]Okay, you want sprinkles.
[210:22.87]Why would you... Hey!
[210:25.13]You liked it!
[210:25.79]That was a happy punch to the face.
[210:31.55]Okay, whatever.
[210:37.56]No cheese.
[210:38.06]I don't think he wants cheese.
[210:39.58]Sprinkles and cheese is here and it's down here.
[210:43.05]No mushrooms either.
[210:44.99]Sprinkles and mushrooms, and he's like, get that shit out of here.
[210:47.79]So what about, um... Pepperoni?
[211:17.20]Thank you.
[211:18.58]Yes.
[211:27.12]Oh, that one on the right was pretty doughy.
[211:31.56]That one on the right did not look very good.
[211:41.53]Cool.
[211:41.73]Alright.
[211:43.49]So can I show you how hard this is on very hard?
[211:53.54]I don't even know... I don't know what this is.
[211:55.94]Okay, so because there's... Uh... Alright, Pac-Man.
[212:17.81]No.
[212:20.06]Pac-Man... No, Pac-Man has nothing.
[212:24.56]this can go down down no nothing this can go no nothing this can go right nothing this can go nothing uh this can go blue um where they're changing them you see what's happening what
[212:57.75]See how fucked up this is?
[212:59.89]Look at what's happening.
[213:00.83]I can't even do it.
[213:02.83]I can't do it.
[213:06.19]Use the magic wand?
[213:08.08]To do what?
[213:08.52]I have to go really fast?
[213:17.88]I can't look at it.
[213:19.22]I actually can't look at it.
[213:20.89]Watch this one.
[213:25.17]Those of you that thought this was a kid's game, good luck.
[213:28.55]Because, uh, okay.
[213:32.49]Let's try to get one person across.
[213:36.49]So if this one goes up, it's going to go up.
[213:41.16]I don't know what this is.
[213:42.34]We have to test it.
[213:43.78]What does this do?
[213:53.57]Is it a teleporter?
[213:55.31]No, it freezes them in place.
[213:59.31]So this is going to go up and then a red.
[214:01.85]I need another red nose to bump.
[214:15.92]Why would anybody get sent up here?
[214:23.45]Uh... Wait, what?
[214:32.77]Okay, if I go... Everybody has to go this way.
[214:34.81]Oh, wait a minute.
[214:39.44]I can bump you this way.
[214:42.24]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[214:46.82]Oh, no.
[214:49.58]Oh, there's another path to...
[214:55.31]Wait.
[214:57.51]What?
[214:57.75]I'm not going to be able to do it.
[215:16.13]I don't think I can do it.
[215:19.35]This is too hard.
[215:20.49]It's not even too hard.
[215:21.35]It's just too much for my brain to look at.
[215:26.69]I have to get one person over there.
[215:33.23]How do I even go this way?
[215:38.61]I think this is just death for every single character.
[215:40.89]I mean, not really.
[215:46.28]How do...
[215:59.05]Because that's changing this to go that way.
[216:02.73]Now this one wants to go up.
[216:03.97]If it goes up, it'll hit the green marker.
[216:08.82]Hit the green.
[216:16.96]And then it's stuck here.
[216:18.74]This made this one turn right.
[216:20.22]So this one now is going to go right.
[216:22.66]Right if you have one eye.
[216:26.04]Which will make you go this way.
[216:27.06]Then up.
[216:29.21]Got it.
[216:29.43]We're going to save at least one person.
[216:42.88]Because now I can.
[216:44.18]Okay.
[216:52.75]Focus on the green and glasses.
[216:54.21]I can't.
[216:57.79]I don't want to look at it anymore.
[217:01.62]Check this one out.
[217:07.46]I actually really like this one.
[217:08.91]This one is fun to do.
[217:11.67]So let's go.
[217:12.21]Let's just start blue, square, blue interior.
[217:19.07]Blue, square, red interior.
[217:24.79]Blue, yellow interior.
[217:29.00]Alright, so what...
[217:31.91]What the fuck does this mean?
[217:47.52]This is yellow internal square is up here Red internal square is here Red internal square with blue
[218:00.65]With a star.
[218:02.17]Oh, that was so completely wrong.
[218:07.09]Triangle?
[218:11.51]Each one of these is... Okay, hold on.
[218:14.48]So it would be... Green?
[218:17.04]With a square.
[218:17.72]Okay.
[218:20.12]It would be square... Red interior, square...
[218:30.07]Triangle?
[218:30.73]No, shit.
[218:35.22]It's not.
[218:35.88]Red interior, square.
[218:41.20]Pink.
[218:44.52]Red interior, square, yellow?
[219:00.36]Get this guy some lithium?
[219:01.88]Remember, we don't get this game.
[219:08.04]Let me help you.
[219:09.74]So, I have to pick a color.
[219:11.70]The color is corresponding to a space on this board.
[219:16.06]The square, the shape, is corresponding to a space on this board.
[219:20.12]You get it.
[219:25.02]So all red interior shapes are this row.
[219:32.28]You see what's happening?
[219:33.62]All blue interior shapes are on this row.
[219:37.88]All yellow interior shapes are on this row.
[219:44.47]So, to get this, it is a red interior shape.
[219:49.49]We have not seen circle, so let's try it.
[219:51.81]Okay.
[219:55.35]So this is a circle.
[219:56.69]This is a circle with a green exterior.
[220:06.94]You couldn't possibly know that.
[220:08.10]I do!
[220:12.53]So the problem is not knowing what interior color this is.
[220:18.33]I'm gonna say pink.
[220:21.55]Okay.
[220:22.43]I'm almost out of power.
[220:42.15]Fuck you!
[220:42.89]What?
[220:54.67]Let me restart.
[220:55.11]Let me restart.
[220:55.81]I'm going to try again.
[220:56.49]What are you going to do?
[221:00.63]E.T.
[221:00.95]Atari?
[221:03.73]Hmm.
[221:04.43]I don't know.
[221:10.61]We have to get a center.
[221:14.60]Okay, so this is interior yellow triangle.
[221:20.02]Interior pink triangle.
[221:28.57]Interior pink triangle red.
[221:34.43]Interior pink triangle green.
[221:38.36]Interior pineapple.
[221:46.61]Interior pink triangle, yellow outside.
[221:52.17]Star.
[221:57.86]Interior pink triangle, yellow outside.
[222:00.46]Wait, I'm confusing myself.
[222:12.01]I just had it.
[222:13.97]I just, hold on.
[222:14.77]I had it.
[222:15.25]Restart.
[222:21.98]Okay.
[222:32.90]Okay.
[222:41.23]The rules change every time you restart.
[222:42.89]Are you serious?
[222:50.63]Oh, fuck.
[222:51.25]Okay, that's why I was screwed.
[222:52.35]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[222:53.39]I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[222:54.17]Pink interior.
[223:00.56]Red triangle.
[223:03.84]Red interior, red triangle.
[223:07.18]Looks like it goes this way.
[223:09.74]Blue interior.
[223:10.58]Okay, good.
[223:12.56]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[223:14.38]Here we go.
[223:17.42]So that means that
[223:20.27]This is red.
[223:21.17]Would this be all red?
[223:24.19]Exterior.
[223:26.65]Red exterior.
[223:28.41]Red star.
[223:29.97]Shit.
[223:40.26]Wait, what?
[223:44.54]Why would that not be in here?
[223:57.84]Exterior is the columns.
[224:00.57]So what about blue?
[224:01.45]Dude, I had it.
[224:04.89]I had it and I just like fucked it all up.
[224:07.55]Interior is the line this time.
[224:11.43]Shit.
[224:11.81]I like, okay, you know when you have something in your brain and then you think about it more than once and then it just completely disappears and it's as if you've never played it before.
[224:22.59]It's just gone.
[224:23.07]It's gone.
[224:26.10]Like, oh, pink interior, red exterior shape is in this column in this row.
[224:34.15]I'll try it again.
[224:34.53]One more time.
[224:48.50]Okay.
[224:49.62]That was a good guess.
[224:57.17]So they're both squares.
[224:58.87]They're both blue exteriors.
[225:01.03]The only difference is their interior is a different color.
[225:04.01]So what does that mean?
[225:04.89]Why is that on a different... Why is this in a different spot?
[225:08.19]I'm going to try something here.
[225:11.78]What is blue exterior, square, green interior?
[225:21.17]Oy.
[225:21.27]Oy.
[225:35.15]So all squares are here.
[225:38.38]In this zone.
[225:41.36]All squares in this zone?
[225:45.12]No.
[225:47.20]All blue exterior is this zone.
[225:51.26]Wait, that might be right.
[225:52.00]I'll test it one more time.
[226:02.32]Okay.
[226:05.91]So I'm imagining this is all green, this is all blue, this is all red.
[226:10.27]So this is all blue.
[226:12.55]Blue?
[226:13.77]Interior?
[226:14.95]No, shit, don't, nobody stop talking.
[226:16.45]Hold on, wait.
[226:18.13]This is, oh, I've had it, I lost it.
[226:19.95]Where is it?
[226:20.97]This is blue, I'm losing it.
[226:22.95]Stop!
[226:23.77]Just sit down for a second.
[226:27.63]Blue interior.
[226:30.93]Blue exterior, blue interior is this.
[226:33.49]So this is not star.
[226:34.99]Let's try circle.
[226:45.57]What?
[226:51.75]This is all blue interior.
[226:53.10]What about diamond?
[226:56.84]God damn it.
[227:01.05]Star?
[227:01.53]Alright, I got it now.
[227:05.49]I actually- I have the pattern.
[227:06.71]I have the pattern.
[227:11.08]So this means this is- this is blue exterior.
[227:13.72]Okay.
[227:17.84]Blue exterior.
[227:20.84]It's not green, but it's a square.
[227:26.42]I guess we'll try pink?
[227:29.17]What?
[227:30.07]I'm so confused.
[227:31.40]No.
[227:32.42]Okay, it's green then.
[227:35.20]No.
[227:35.44]A yellow interior?
[227:41.84]No.
[227:43.67]What the hell is this?
[227:45.89]Yellow... Square... Okay, this is a... The shapes don't match up.
[228:00.85]So this is a yellow interior.
[228:03.31]It's... What?
[228:10.41]That does not match up, though.
[228:11.59]Alright, good luck trying to figure out the rest of this shit.
[228:18.79]It's not fucking hard.
[228:22.05]It's not hard, Jerma.
[228:23.81]Yeah.
[228:32.31]It's called a pattern.
[228:33.43]I just got to recognize it and figure it out.
[228:35.63]And it's not even really a pattern because look at this.
[228:37.89]Like these shapes are not even in the right order here.
[228:41.21]This should be a square.
[228:43.85]This is not.
[228:44.32]This is completely different in each row.
[228:48.04]So sit down.
[228:49.50]Relax.
[228:56.72]Hey, sit down.
[228:59.36]It's going diagonally.
[229:03.60]You smoking crack?
[229:15.28]Alright, so let's try red.
[229:16.10]Let's see where this goes.
[229:18.91]Okay.
[229:20.71]Red.
[229:21.01]So I need red exterior.
[229:27.13]Square is here.
[229:30.31]With a blue interior.
[229:45.83]Circle.
[229:46.27]If I do blue interior, where does it go?
[229:57.69]Where does this go?
[229:59.35]Is it going to be... Alright.
[230:08.96]So this matches.
[230:10.46]So it does match.
[230:13.33]I didn't know if it was going to be scrambled in every single one of these quadrants.
[230:16.19]Okay.
[230:19.19]So go diagonal.
[230:24.24]So this is a... No, no, no, this is not.
[230:28.76]If I do this... With a red exterior.
[230:34.20]Shit.
[230:37.98]A red triangle then.
[230:39.16]Okay, so red triangle will do that.
[230:54.36]Can I have the controller?
[230:55.16]You can download the game.
[230:56.90]I'm already out of juice.
[231:05.17]I might accidentally get like two of these.
[231:06.81]Let's see.
[231:11.09]So I don't know what the leftmost thing is.
[231:13.48]Okay, so hold on.
[231:15.14]What is that?
[231:16.48]I have not figured that out.
[231:17.98]What is this one?
[231:18.70]I have not figured that out.
[231:19.96]This is a square.
[231:23.61]So if this is a square, it is a interior blue square.
[231:28.65]And the color is we don't have any idea.
[231:35.24]OK.
[231:39.80]Green.
[231:40.12]What is here?
[231:52.97]It has to be.
[231:53.73]You don't have any mud left?
[231:56.76]No.
[232:01.54]Okay, so green exterior.
[232:03.48]No, I want to do circle.
[232:15.09]What color inside?
[232:15.95]Red?
[232:16.17]Yeah, okay.
[232:20.87]I'm out of juice.
[232:25.27]I stopped paying attention to the puzzle.
[232:26.57]I feel so lost.
[232:31.30]Is there another shot left?
[232:33.34]I'm able to get the last at least two people.
[232:35.70]I got one shot left.
[232:37.68]Alright, so this is either yellow or pink.
[232:43.42]Oh no, I lose.
[232:51.94]Okay.
[232:52.98]Check this one out on hard.
[232:56.65]Good luck Okay, I don't I don't even I don't know what they want me to do But I'm gonna just put people in places
[233:28.46]This shouldn't even be that hard.
[233:30.02]What about noses?
[233:36.45]But can't I just put everybody in an individual room?
[233:40.37]There are more doors than Zumbinis.
[233:44.82]They have to go in a specific spot.
[233:48.20]Green noses?
[234:02.51]The door pattern.
[234:05.19]Mmm.
[234:06.67]The door pattern and the floor pattern.
[234:14.63]So that would be, uh... Does it make me cry if I was playing this by myself?
[234:44.11]I don't.
[234:45.04]I just genuinely don't really know.
[234:46.56]And I already lost.
[234:53.61]Try Springs?
[234:54.45]Um...
[235:10.61]Well, at least one person survived.
[235:11.97]Sorry, folks.
[235:13.65]We are closed for the night.
[235:16.33]Gotta go to a big gig.
[235:18.58]Somebody said this one feels legit impossible.
[235:22.02]I don't think it is.
[235:23.04]I think maybe it is.
[235:24.50]I don't know.
[235:25.68]Let's do the fleeing one.
[235:26.48]Let's see how much difficult this one is.
[235:32.11]How much harder could you possibly make this one?
[235:37.59]It might be opposites.
[235:47.65]Alright, so let's just go by what we know.
[235:51.17]The hair is... All this stuff is wrong.
[235:54.01]None of this matches.
[236:00.04]Let's just put another random person that has nothing in common with you.
[236:03.40]Okay.
[236:06.02]Okay.
[236:17.08]Do the glasses match?
[236:24.34]Pink nose.
[236:25.22]Okay, hold on.
[236:25.96]So red nose is purple nose, maybe?
[236:29.16]Red nose and glasses.
[236:30.18]Do I have one?
[236:35.12]I don't have a red nose and glasses.
[236:50.36]What the hell is this criteria?
[236:52.06]Spring is high heel.
[236:55.56]Bike is also high heel.
[237:00.06]Yellow nose is also purple nose as well as red nose.
[237:09.30]What about you?
[237:10.52]No, you.
[237:11.31]Okay.
[237:30.97]So that's the hat.
[237:32.15]One, two, three hats left.
[237:34.37]Are there three of these hairs left?
[237:38.23]One, two, three.
[237:40.09]There is.
[237:40.41]Alright.
[237:46.39]Um.
[237:49.37]Glasses are the feet.
[237:53.53]Oh, that's true.
[237:58.89]So glass, so eyes are feet.
[238:02.72]That means that... It hurts my head.
[238:06.96]Eyes are this.
[238:09.06]So... Cyclops?
[238:13.08]We'll just see what this does.
[238:17.08]No.
[238:21.08]Okay, well, eyes... So this is a Cyclops.
[238:26.15]There's only one Cyclops left.
[238:27.61]It has to be this one.
[238:30.35]Right?
[238:30.55]I think so.
[238:34.88]Yep.
[238:44.86]Is feet hair?
[238:48.54]Nose is eyes, eyes is feet, hair is nose.
[238:51.80]Nose is eyes.
[239:03.44]What is hair?
[239:06.27]Feed his hair.
[239:09.84]So it's one of these four.
[239:10.90]Okay.
[239:20.26]So feed his... So it's not this one.
[239:25.89]Wait, maybe it is this one.
[239:28.57]It's this one, right?
[239:30.23]Oh, fuck.
[239:43.35]yeah it's that one okay and then it's this one alright well okay that was hard cool what else do we try very very hard what is this one on very hard
[240:11.81]Uh, it doesn't tell you.
[240:12.93]You just have to figure it out.
[240:13.89]Alright, let's start with you.
[240:15.83]No.
[240:19.02]How about, um, spring?
[240:25.14]What about, uh, yellow nose and spring?
[240:29.06]It's probably hair.
[240:33.02]I think it's hair.
[240:33.58]It's not hair.
[240:40.82]Is it eyes?
[240:45.40]It's not eyes.
[240:48.74]Is it noses?
[240:52.34]What is it?
[240:59.17]Is it feet?
[240:59.93]I think it is feet.
[241:07.13]Whoa, what?
[241:11.07]What do you mean?
[241:13.39]Wait.
[241:19.81]Wait, what?
[241:21.23]Why did that not happen?
[241:28.88]What is going on?
[241:31.06]Oh, they're all locked.
[241:36.34]Blue should... Wait, because this...
[241:42.72]Sorting by multiple traits at once.
[241:45.36]Sort by feet, then eyes, etc.
[241:48.42]Okay, that's hard.
[241:51.22]What about this one?
[241:57.32]Wait, what?
[241:58.78]Okay.
[242:01.14]What are we doing?
[242:01.90]Okay.
[242:20.15]They're changing.
[242:22.39]So I have to match this one.
[242:24.05]So I need a spring?
[242:24.81]No, I want this to be a spring.
[242:40.09]How do I get that to be a spring?
[242:52.90]Pass through the ice that matches them.
[242:56.59]I have to match in the middle.
[243:01.17]What the fuck?
[243:04.95]Okay, um...
[243:12.59]I don't care.
[243:13.21]It's too much.
[243:18.56]Uh, what about this one?
[243:22.50]Yikes.
[243:23.14]No fucking way.
[243:26.14]Not a chance I'm doing this one.
[243:28.74]I'll give it a real try, but no.
[243:30.86]I can't even look at it.
[243:40.56]This is not... Wait, they all have to be connected.
[243:43.00]I can't do it.
[243:51.59]What about this one?
[243:54.65]This one might not be that bad.
[243:55.89]Okay.
[243:58.67]So they have to share...
[244:11.03]They have to share a trait with somebody adjacent to them, right?
[244:16.19]So you have to go here.
[244:19.37]This is going to be a nightmare, but I'll try.
[244:20.73]They have to share some kind of trait.
[244:30.30]What's wrong?
[244:30.72]The shoes.
[244:32.86]The shoes match.
[244:39.16]There's a page on making an algorithm to solve this specific puzzle on Zoombinis, by the way.
[244:44.02]What?
[244:48.68]Dude, how about this?
[244:50.78]Try to do one for 30 minutes and we'll gamble.
[244:57.92]That's a long time.
[244:59.16]30 minutes sub only?
[245:01.62]30 minutes?
[245:03.84]That sounds boring.
[245:06.42]That sounds really boring.
[245:09.82]That's like a third.
[245:10.83]That's like 20% of this whole stream so far.
[245:15.67]Make it an hour?
[245:16.53]No, that would be horrible.
[245:17.91]How about 10 minutes?
[245:21.99]15 minutes.
[245:22.27]15 minutes.
[245:24.61]Can I complete this in 15 minutes?
[245:28.41]What I'm looking at right now.
[245:38.33]15 minutes.
[245:43.43]The deal?
[245:49.14]Do one that you're at least comfortable with.
[245:56.34]I think I could do that one.
[245:57.96]It's going to be kind of hard, but I could do it.
[246:05.05]So this one, again, is they have to share a trait with whoever's adjacent to them.
[246:11.15]Yeah, put it in emote only.
[246:15.10]15 minutes?
[246:15.42]You got it.
[246:16.00]I'll try.
[246:21.36]You'd better beat it.
[246:23.20]I can't tell you that's going to happen.
[246:25.92]In five minutes, I might realize I can't do this and get up and go get like a snack.
[246:31.00]Just be aware of what you're betting on here.
[246:33.25]This is very, very hard Zumbini's logical journey.
[246:37.95]This shit is not for kids.
[246:39.65]Kids can't do this.
[246:41.43]This is not even for adults.
[246:42.43]Computers have problems doing this.
[246:44.61]They made an algorithm to try to beat this game on very, very hard.
[246:48.89]And that even struggled.
[246:51.22]So just make sure you understand what you're betting on.
[247:03.03]Alright, ready?
[247:06.05]And go.
[247:08.13]15 minutes.
[247:08.39]Alright, let's go.
[247:13.19]What do I have the most of?
[247:15.06]This hair.
[247:32.64]There you go, you got it.
[247:33.58]What's the matter?
[247:40.22]Uhhh... Why not?
[247:41.20]He just drowned that person.
[248:05.44]Why not?
[248:07.34]Is it only based on hair?
[248:08.75]Hold on.
[248:11.69]Nose?
[248:12.35]Wait.
[248:13.39]It's got to match everybody.
[248:16.13]So I need... Sure.
[248:47.47]There you go, you got it.
[248:53.51]No!
[248:54.64]Oh, fuck.
[249:01.88]Um... There you go, you got it.
[249:23.13]You cannot help me with emotes.
[249:24.35]It's not going to work.
[249:26.13]This isn't Breath of the Wild.
[249:27.11]Nope.
[249:37.41]What do you mean no?
[249:39.17]Why not?
[249:39.57]Glasses?
[249:40.09]Shoot.
[249:40.59]What?
[249:43.22]What?
[249:45.34]Oh, this dickhead down here.
[249:49.24]Sure.
[250:01.50]Nope.
[250:03.62]I screwed up so bad.
[250:08.77]I need to go by feet and hair and nose and eyes.
[250:27.48]This is impossible.
[251:01.29]There you go, you got it.
[251:10.86]I'm going, I'm going.
[251:16.90]Uh... How much time do I have left?
[251:42.30]It's been five minutes already?
[251:43.67]What?
[251:43.99]Alright, I'm gonna walk in.
[251:48.55]Okay, hold on.
[252:02.44]I have so many of these pink shoes, I don't know what to do with them.
[252:07.98]Eyes and hair, eyes and hair, eyes and hair.
[252:11.39]Hair... and... eyes and nose.
[252:19.03]Okay.
[252:20.87]Eyes... nose... hair.
[252:24.35]Okay.
[252:25.51]Eyes... nose... hair.
[252:28.58]Eyes...
[252:41.20]Oh.
[252:54.17]This is close.
[252:54.97]Okay, if I move the one to the left.
[252:58.99]And switch it with somebody with shoes.
[253:01.95]Hold on.
[253:07.83]Why?
[253:08.80]Why?
[253:11.50]No, I can, I can, I can.
[253:14.28]Yes, I can.
[253:33.03]It's so close and I just, I need to move like one person.
[253:47.10]Who needs to move to make this right?
[253:54.99]Pointing at Meowdy.
[253:56.27]What does that mean?
[253:57.07]You trying to tell me something?
[254:02.27]Sunglasses down.
[254:04.41]Hair left.
[254:06.56]Eyes up.
[254:11.16]Wait, if I...
[254:19.60]gg gg gg not yet there you go you got it
[254:56.59]What?
[254:56.81]Why?
[254:57.13]What are you talking about?
[254:59.57]What?
[254:59.97]How?
[255:00.71]I'm very confused right now.
[255:03.35]Explain this.
[255:05.49]Pink shoes.
[255:06.03]Pink shoes to the left.
[255:08.15]The eyes that are kind of half closed.
[255:10.19]Down.
[255:11.15]Eyes that are half closed.
[255:12.90]Oh, the person on the right.
[255:14.22]There's only two.
[255:31.11]Come on, I can do it.
[255:39.66]No, I wanted to put you there.
[255:40.68]No!
[255:41.42]You're so cute all soaking wet.
[255:51.92]Time?
[255:52.96]Seven minutes?
[255:57.51]There you go, you got it.
[256:05.49]I need to rethink this.
[256:34.66]It's just like four distinct different variables to be aware of.
[256:38.72]I'm so close, but I'm so far away.
[256:42.25]Ah, sure.
[256:52.19]Hey, that seat's too small for the two of you.
[257:03.44]Why?
[257:03.76]Ah, sure.
[257:28.01]I can't do it.
[257:29.11]I can't do it.
[257:30.86]It's just it's so tricky.
[257:32.72]It's a lot of It's a lot of ifs thens or buts and then that's a lot of moving.
[257:39.24]It's hot.
[257:40.26]I got five minutes hold on I Didn't put any springs down.
[257:44.60]Oh Oh
[258:15.35]not this one but wait no it I think I lose sorry everybody I don't think I can do it green nose green nose wait hold on green green green
[258:42.83]And then no, and then no.
[258:49.93]I need a different nose.
[258:51.13]I need a different nose to go here.
[258:52.58]We're doing a different nose.
[258:57.28]Hmm.
[259:02.58]Our computer had pro they made a computer program and it didn't do it.
[259:15.81]This is so hard.
[259:27.08]Everybody has to have something in common with everybody next to them and it's just like hurting my head.
[259:40.06]There you go, you got it.
[259:52.15]Nope.
[259:52.87]No, but it's always a problem.
[259:55.32]It's always a problem.
[259:59.46]See, because there's always somebody that doesn't match.
[260:02.00]There you go, you got it.
[260:05.24]It's always a problem.
[260:14.30]Okay, hold on.
[260:28.06]There you go, you got it.
[260:37.95]Fuck!
[260:50.19]I think it was a good attempt.
[260:52.40]It was a pretty good attempt.
[260:54.74]I think it's over though.
[260:56.36]I think this is far too difficult.
[260:57.52]It's not over yet.
[261:07.21]Hold on.
[261:20.06]No!
[261:25.40]Shit.
[261:26.26]I'm not happy right now.
[261:28.97]I'm very unhappy.
[261:30.19]What do you mean, no?
[261:31.69]30 seconds?
[261:32.15]I lose.
[261:34.17]It's over.
[261:34.53]I just ended.
[261:34.95]I lose.
[261:35.15]It's over.
[261:35.39]I can't do it.
[261:53.98]I can't do it.
[261:56.23]It's over.
[261:56.75]I can't do it.
[261:57.31]I just can't do it.
[262:00.89]Let him out.
[262:01.75]Let him out of emote only.
[262:02.71]I came kind of close, but not really.
[262:04.01]It's like a Rubik's Cube where somebody's probably just like, oh dude, it's so easy.
[262:08.51]Just put the green guy over there and then put the fucking purple guy right here and then put the blue guy over here.
[262:13.46]It's so simple.
[262:23.43]Hard.
[262:24.21]Sorry, everybody.
[262:25.31]You fucked me, bro.
[262:26.53]I'm sorry.
[262:28.57]I'll make it up to you.
[262:29.95]Ready?
[262:34.82]Can I do the pizza one?
[262:36.02]I'm very, very hard.
[262:37.70]Bet on me this is my game.
[262:39.62]This is my game.
[262:42.60]This is my game right here.
[262:43.94]Another bet.
[262:46.14]Ten minutes.
[262:47.78]This is my game.
[263:00.10]I did it before.
[263:00.76]You watched me do it before.
[263:04.56]How could you make it up to my grandma, huh?
[263:06.32]She went all in.
[263:07.28]She has nothing now.
[263:13.41]Your grandmother probably has like 12 channel points on this stream.
[263:19.03]She probably opened it, was checking in to see what her grandson or granddaughter was up to, and closed it in five minutes.
[263:28.00]So...
[263:30.41]Okay, we ready?
[263:39.41]Have faith in me with the pizza minigame, I'm telling you.
[263:41.57]I just did it on very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very hard already.
[263:47.06]I got it.
[263:52.22]I got it.
[264:10.97]Why do you play puzzle games on stream?
[264:12.61]You don't like it.
[264:13.69]Chat doesn't like it.
[264:14.49]I don't like it.
[264:15.21]Can you just go back to playing Ass Fart Simulator?
[264:17.33]What do you mean?
[264:19.35]I like it.
[264:20.79]I think it's one of my favorite games.
[264:27.40]I love how you're separated from that.
[264:30.08]You don't like it.
[264:31.28]Chat doesn't like it.
[264:32.76]I don't like it.
[264:34.36]Aren't you a part of chat?
[264:36.12]How come you're separating yourself from chat?
[264:43.19]You're in chat.
[264:47.63]You know, you don't like it.
[264:50.67]I love this.
[264:51.39]I love this pizza game.
[264:52.63]Alright, we're ready.
[264:55.18]Hope you bet on me because I'm going to make you a lot of channel points if you did.
[265:01.88]In three, two, one, go.
[265:10.42]More good.
[265:14.55]It doesn't matter.
[265:16.98]That's fine.
[265:17.48]We already know.
[265:17.96]We're going for the trunk right here.
[265:22.62]Okay.
[265:23.86]Trunk.
[265:25.16]Very much would have been happy about this.
[265:27.44]Does not want jalapeños.
[265:31.02]Jalapeños.
[265:31.58]I know how to say it.
[265:32.24]Why did I just say it weirdly?
[265:33.70]Let's go like this.
[265:40.85]No cheese.
[265:41.39]Got it.
[265:43.33]I'll remake it.
[265:44.31]I'll remake it.
[265:44.95]I'll give you a refund.
[265:46.17]Just give it back.
[265:48.23]Okay.
[265:56.27]So you don't want cheese.
[265:57.59]You don't want peppers.
[265:59.93]Do you want pineapple?
[266:07.52]Okay.
[266:10.60]Those of you that have just lost a shitload of channel points, I just want to say, how could you have possibly bet against me in my favorite minigame in my favorite game of all time?
[266:22.88]I'm just shocked, really, I am.
[266:28.63]Okay.
[266:30.21]What about just sprinkles?
[266:38.02]Is that all I get?
[266:39.19]Good.
[266:40.41]Something on that's not good for me.
[266:43.07]Okay.
[266:49.86]I'm going to do something here that might be a little unorthodox.
[266:56.20]And it was because I didn't even look.
[266:58.98]There's something there I won't eat.
[267:03.31]Something's wrong.
[267:06.65]Yeah, that's really unorthodox to a point where it was completely wrong.
[267:09.56]I just didn't even look over there.
[267:12.18]Okay.
[267:16.64]Nobody wants cheese.
[267:17.50]Good.
[267:20.06]Time check.
[267:20.66]What do I got?
[267:21.42]Seven and a half minutes?
[267:37.66]Uh, and pepperoni.
[267:47.40]You don't want pepperoni.
[267:52.32]She might actually like pineapple because the cherry was there, so he wanted it.
[267:56.90]I'll try that.
[268:06.89]no okay um so you want that thing that one you want pepperoni sprinkles and jalapeños that topping what no wait what's going on something's wrong pepperoni what's happening pepperoni
[268:41.26]Doesn't want pineapple.
[268:44.26]Doesn't want mushrooms.
[268:45.84]Doesn't want jalapeños.
[268:48.08]What the hell do you want?
[268:51.96]Chocolate syrup?
[268:55.67]Is it cheese?
[268:59.19]I thought everybody didn't want cheese.
[269:00.69]Oh, it's because that one has a fucking cherry on it.
[269:03.63]What?
[269:08.97]Uh-oh.
[269:09.69]There's something on that I don't want.
[269:15.45]What?
[269:15.71]It's mushrooms.
[269:16.45]Oh my god.
[269:17.30]What am I doing?
[269:18.04]It's mushrooms.
[269:18.58]It's mushrooms.
[269:19.18]I got it.
[269:19.56]I got it.
[269:19.82]It's mushrooms.
[269:20.70]It's literally mushrooms.
[269:21.48]Game over.
[269:21.84]I win.
[269:23.34]What?
[269:26.68]Wait.
[269:28.56]What's happening?
[269:29.90]What's going on?
[269:31.72]I thought she liked mushrooms.
[269:33.02]Does she not like pepperoni?
[269:34.38]Was I not paying attention?
[269:36.34]What happened?
[269:37.73]No, no, I'm serious.
[269:38.59]What happened?
[269:39.05]I thought she liked the pepperonis.
[269:42.83]She liked the mushrooms.
[269:46.55]I'm very confused right now.
[269:47.75]What did I just do?
[269:48.47]What happened?
[269:51.14]I just like blacked out for five seconds.
[269:54.44]Did she not want pepperoni?
[270:02.66]Why?
[270:03.30]What's going on?
[270:03.98]I just lost track of everything because look at all this shit.
[270:07.44]What happened?
[270:10.93]I got five minutes.
[270:11.71]I have to just start from scratch here, okay?
[270:13.29]Let's, um... She likes mushrooms.
[270:18.21]Mushrooms and pepperoni.
[270:19.55]Just do it again!
[270:20.07]Just do it again!
[270:21.25]I fucked it up.
[270:22.95]Oh my god, what's happening?
[270:24.29]Actually fucking being stupid.
[270:27.03]Okay, she doesn't want pepperoni.
[270:28.95]Why did I think she wanted pepperoni?
[270:31.23]Why did I think she wanted pepperoni?
[270:33.19]Why?
[270:34.29]I don't even remember what made me think that.
[270:36.44]What made me think she wanted pepperoni on this?
[270:40.02]Nobody.
[270:40.98]Nobody.
[270:42.78]It's cheese.
[270:47.08]I got it.
[270:47.74]We're good.
[270:49.24]What the fuck are you talking about?
[270:52.20]How did I just black out the last like two minutes?
[270:56.82]I don't even know what happened.
[270:59.64]Oh shit.
[271:00.44]Okay, so what do you want on your pizza?
[271:08.90]Is it?
[271:09.34]No, you don't want pineapple.
[271:15.44]Maybe it is pineapple.
[271:21.23]Because there was... No, it's not pineapple.
[271:26.37]Dude, I can't even read the chat.
[271:29.91]And I looked over here and forgot the whole game.
[271:34.39]I'm going to get it right now.
[271:35.19]I'm not looking over a chat.
[271:36.13]I looked over a chat and I forgot the entire game.
[271:38.31]I was like, oh, what are they doing over here?
[271:39.81]Oh, interesting.
[271:40.41]And I look back over and I'm like, I forget the entire experience.
[271:43.39]Alright.
[271:43.89]I'm not looking at chat ever again.
[271:47.18]What do you want?
[271:49.04]You want this shit.
[271:50.06]And you want jalapeños on it, too.
[271:52.08]That's a guarantee.
[272:00.37]Good.
[272:00.97]Okay.
[272:01.51]Let's go.
[272:01.89]Let's go.
[272:02.13]I got four minutes.
[272:02.65]I'm good.
[272:02.93]I have three minutes.
[272:04.97]What is this?
[272:05.53]What do you want?
[272:06.85]You don't like anything.
[272:07.55]This guy doesn't like anything.
[272:08.63]Let's just do, um... This.
[272:11.26]This.
[272:16.90]Alright, good start.
[272:20.00]You don't want jalapeños.
[272:25.62]How about, um... How about, uh... Uh... I gotta start from scratch.
[272:40.18]This is gonna be it.
[272:41.94]No, no cheese.
[272:42.84]Alright, so no cheese...
[272:49.91]No cheese.
[272:51.13]What about just mushrooms?
[272:57.33]Okay.
[272:58.33]Alright.
[272:58.64]I got it.
[272:58.94]I got it.
[272:59.14]I got it.
[272:59.48]No cheese.
[273:00.08]No mushrooms.
[273:00.86]What about just pepperoni?
[273:02.28]We're gonna get it.
[273:14.47]What?
[273:14.75]Time.
[273:15.07]Time.
[273:15.31]That's time.
[273:15.67]That's time.
[273:15.97]That's time.
[273:16.27]That's time.
[273:16.57]That's time.
[273:16.91]That's time.
[273:24.01]That's time.
[273:25.87]How much time was left?
[273:29.35]150 seconds left.
[273:31.03]We got it.
[273:34.15]I completely forgot her entire order.
[273:37.91]Jesus.
[273:42.29]Don't have a bet against me and pizza maker.
[273:53.22]Have we not seen one on Very Very Hard?
[273:57.71]We haven't done this one.
[274:04.29]You can let him out.
[274:05.35]We don't need to bet again.
[274:06.33]We don't have to bet again.
[274:09.05]Anymore.
[274:13.08]I made all your money back.
[274:14.04]Is it Nose?
[274:24.99]You do not?
[274:25.51]Okay, maybe hair?
[274:27.69]What about hair?
[274:28.21]Let's try hair.
[274:36.44]What the actual hell did I just tune into?
[274:38.26]The logical journey of the Zumbinis.
[274:41.06]Hmm?
[274:46.19]This way.
[274:48.13]Uh-uh.
[274:53.05]Go ahead.
[274:53.87]Go ahead.
[274:56.19]It was the easiest money of my life.
[275:04.15]Uh, can I go this way?
[275:06.41]Are you okay with me coming up?
[275:07.69]No, you're not.
[275:16.24]So why can you go here, but you can't?
[275:18.44]What's the difference?
[275:19.70]Is it eyes?
[275:20.16]It has to be nose, right?
[275:23.54]Yellow nose this way?
[275:26.18]No.
[275:27.67]Yellow nose this way.
[275:28.95]It has to be noses for the top, bro.
[275:34.73]Okay.
[275:38.59]Really?
[275:53.53]So this one must be eye.
[275:54.81]No.
[275:55.73]Hair?
[275:56.03]I have no idea.
[276:03.66]I guess we just figured it out.
[276:07.58]Let's try that then.
[276:10.12]Okay.
[276:12.79]I think this is correct.
[276:13.67]No, it's not.
[276:18.81]Spring probably has to go up this way.
[276:20.27]Proceed.
[276:28.00]Red nose over here.
[276:29.63]Nope.
[276:32.75]Red nose this way.
[276:36.53]Red nose this way.
[276:39.55]No.
[276:39.99]Oh, sorry.
[276:41.81]This way.
[276:43.47]A blue nose with this hair going this way.
[276:49.91]Nope, that's wrong.
[276:55.43]Enjoy yourself.
[276:59.05]That's correct.
[277:00.07]Pink.
[277:01.17]And then there's no green noses.
[277:02.55]Where'd the green noses go?
[277:05.36]Probably up around.
[277:05.94]Alright.
[277:12.28]Let's see.
[277:12.56]Do you want to see what happens when you lose?
[277:13.90]It's pretty bad.
[277:25.06]Ready?
[277:33.68]Why is it not happening?
[277:40.85]Can you lose on practice?
[277:45.21]Oh, yes, you can.
[277:46.09]Yeah, you can.
[278:02.65]This whole place is gonna fucking cave in.
[278:22.92]They're very forgiving on this level.
[278:25.50]Unlike every other level in the game on Hard.
[278:35.41]Why do I remember this being way more morbid?
[278:38.07]I thought the whole thing caved in.
[278:46.90]Alright, that's probably it.
[278:48.32]That was fun.
[278:49.98]Any encores you'd like to see?
[278:52.34]Before we stop?
[278:55.40]Any encores?
[279:00.66]Do the lion room?
[279:05.83]Do pizza again?
[279:07.11]Paint wall again?
[279:08.11]Let me do paint wall on the very hard, not very, very hard.
[279:20.15]Okay, that's very weird.
[279:21.37]I don't know why they'd be this far away from each other.
[279:27.58]How would these two be this far away?
[279:29.08]They have the same hair, they have the same feet.
[279:36.84]Okay, blue, pink, blue.
[279:45.21]Pink.
[279:45.49]Blue?
[279:45.77]I don't know.
[279:46.71]Pink, pink.
[280:00.78]blue pink blue blue pink blue blue blue pink blue blue blue pink pink pink green green no
[280:40.25]It's the eyes.
[280:40.87]Yeah, I know.
[280:41.41]But who goes where?
[280:46.96]Because I can't just put this guy right here.
[280:48.80]This is the hair and the eyes.
[280:58.67]Eyes then feet.
[281:01.48]So it would be that.
[281:03.10]Okay.
[281:06.85]Um, I'm going to imagine it's this and then this, and then this.
[281:28.85]But what... How do I determine this then?
[281:32.15]Like this?
[281:34.67]Got it.
[281:36.13]Very, very, very hard.
[281:37.43]Very, very, very hard.
[281:38.53]Alright, this one is not on very, very, very hard.
[281:48.49]Alright, good.
[281:55.44]Got it.
[281:56.96]Interior blue.
[281:59.62]Exterior blue.
[282:01.96]Diamond.
[282:04.58]Why did I just do that twice?
[282:06.26]I need to go eat a fucking jar of peanut butter.
[282:11.90]I thought that was... Wait.
[282:13.58]I'm confusing myself.
[282:17.48]There it is.
[282:17.74]I had to mute you, dude.
[282:26.28]Sorry, you're annoying.
[282:30.30]I had a mute.
[282:31.20]What are you doing here?
[282:39.37]Okay.
[282:42.29]How about that?
[282:43.93]Nope.
[282:51.13]A jar.
[282:51.59]What are the whole jar?
[282:52.83]A like a few spoonfuls.
[283:02.40]Alright, so this is blue, red.
[283:05.88]Let's just try pink.
[283:08.33]No?
[283:08.65]Okay, what about yellow?
[283:11.49]Got it.
[283:12.03]Yellow with a diamond interior.
[283:21.33]Circle interior.
[283:23.83]Why peanut butter?
[283:24.51]Protein.
[283:26.76]Protein, good fats.
[283:36.13]Okay.
[283:42.69]So we need to find a different interior.
[283:46.21]Okay.
[283:49.92]Red interiors.
[283:50.78]I need red interior triangle.
[283:53.70]Yellow.
[283:55.96]This is green.
[284:04.34]Exterior.
[284:06.88]Red interior.
[284:07.60]Triangle.
[284:11.83]Okay.
[284:12.15]So... Yellow interior.
[284:16.85]Square.
[284:35.28]Green exterior.
[284:48.02]Pink interior.
[284:50.05]There's only two places it could be.
[284:54.75]Pink interior or green interior.
[284:56.55]We'll do pink interior.
[285:00.57]Which hopefully is over here.
[285:05.24]Pink exterior.
[285:12.32]Square.
[285:14.58]Right?
[285:14.82]It's right here.
[285:27.87]Do I have enough shots to do one more?
[285:32.63]No, there's no more mud.
[285:35.17]Damn it.
[285:35.57]It's alright.
[285:39.72]It's okay.
[285:44.22]Do it again.
[285:46.80]Alright, one more time, that one.
[285:48.98]This one's fun.
[285:52.72]This time I don't want to waste that much.
[285:56.33]Let's go...
[285:59.33]Alright, so what does that mean?
[286:00.41]Let's try a different one.
[286:01.05]Let's try, like, just, like, circle.
[286:02.53]Okay.
[286:18.56]Shit.
[286:18.90]Okay, this is gonna be weird.
[286:19.87]So this is yellow... ...diamond...
[286:27.17]So this would be... God, I don't know.
[286:31.07]It's all green exterior in here.
[286:34.99]When the interior is in the same area like this, it's kind of hard.
[286:46.50]I'm going to say red, no, blue interior and star.
[286:50.64]Nope.
[287:00.20]pink interior square.
[287:05.58]Good.
[287:09.41]Alright, we're gonna go red exterior, pink interior square.
[287:14.03]I'm hoping it's this one right here.
[287:18.87]We're gonna do blue exterior, red and pink interior square.
[287:33.28]So what would be all the way to the right?
[287:40.00]Circle, right?
[287:40.72]No.
[287:41.56]Star?
[287:42.04]No.
[287:42.80]Square?
[287:43.12]No.
[287:44.28]Triangle?
[287:50.18]Yellow interior is here.
[287:53.58]Blue exterior is here.
[287:54.85]It would be triangle.
[287:57.61]Okay.
[288:04.91]Blue exterior.
[288:08.03]Green interior.
[288:12.59]Triangle.
[288:15.52]I am so brilliant at this.
[288:21.70]Okay.
[288:23.16]I think I'll get it this time.
[288:25.90]Yellow exterior.
[288:33.34]We're hoping it's this one.
[288:35.62]Yellow exterior.
[288:37.44]Square.
[288:40.00]Pink.
[288:45.54]Ah.
[288:48.28]What?
[288:50.20]No, I fucked it up.
[288:51.20]Yellow exterior.
[288:51.94]Blue interior.
[288:54.22]There it is.
[288:58.35]I have two more shots in here for sure.
[289:09.55]Pink exterior.
[289:10.49]What's in the middle?
[289:14.85]Star.
[289:18.95]And... Yellow interior?
[289:27.47]Oh, no, no, no.
[289:27.95]It's the third slot.
[289:28.87]What's the third slot?
[289:30.05]Diamond.
[289:32.69]I got one more shot.
[289:33.31]I'm good.
[289:33.71]Just gotta get it right.
[289:39.60]Alright.
[289:42.18]I got one more shot.
[289:45.00]This is triangle.
[289:49.09]With a pink exterior.
[289:52.93]And a blue interior.
[289:54.33]I think that's correct.
[290:03.54]Alright, I got it.
[290:08.97]Cool.
[290:09.73]I got it.
[290:14.13]Earlier in the stream, you said you don't know Mountain Rescue, but you literally streamed it.
[290:21.98]I know, but here's the thing.
[290:24.86]Dude, I've played like two or three thousand video games over the last twelve years doing this.
[290:33.25]I don't remember all of them.
[290:34.47]I just really don't.
[290:38.36]I just don't remember.
[290:44.01]Some of them, like, seven or eight, nine years ago, I don't have the capacity to remember every single video game I played five to ten years ago.
[290:58.16]Like, if you put it in front of me, I'd be like, oh, okay, right.
[291:02.80]Alright.
[291:07.52]There's been millions of pieces of information that have gone through here over the last 15 years.
[291:16.94]I win.
[291:20.34]Alright.
[291:21.52]And that's it.
[291:25.66]I'm just trying to get one across.
[291:44.87]Okay.
[292:19.18]This sounds like a Linkin Park song.
[292:30.12]It kind of does.
[292:39.01]Hey, one survived.
[292:40.07]Alright, these are impossible.
[292:44.39]Alright, that's going to be it.
[292:45.75]That's all the plan was today.
[292:46.67]Let's play this for a little while.
[292:51.48]Look at how much easier this is when I'm easy.
[292:52.96]Okay, you guys ready?
[292:58.49]I literally thought the perfect game you should play.
[293:02.89]It's called You're in the Movies.
[293:04.75]I've played that already.
[293:05.29]So here's the thing.
[293:14.75]What is...
[293:19.81]What is a good game that I can play?
[293:21.65]I have a couple of options here.
[293:26.09]I'm not talking about today.
[293:27.19]I'm talking about the next time I stream.
[293:28.57]I haven't really been playing this for five hours.
[293:34.07]It was fun.
[293:39.77]Maybe we'll do like a grab bag stream.
[293:42.47]Next stream.
[293:44.21]Yeah, Sorcery is still on the 24th.
[293:50.13]Because we got through the things I wanted to get through.
[293:53.23]I wanted to play Zumbinis.
[293:56.05]We did that.
[293:59.01]I wanted to play Katamari and finish it.
[294:01.57]We did that.
[294:03.79]Do the Lies of P demo?
[294:06.35]I'll probably just wait for the full game.
[294:09.57]I'm imagining the Lies of P demo is the tutorial zone and the tutorial boss and then that's it.
[294:15.20]I'll just wait until it's out.
[294:21.33]Maybe we'll do a grab bag on Monday.
[294:25.57]I'll see you guys on Monday next stream.
[294:32.23]Do more infomercials.
[294:35.11]Maybe a reverse delay.
[294:36.63]Maybe a reverse delay in the future.
[294:38.29]It's possible I just stream on Sunday.
[294:41.49]But let's plan for Monday and maybe I'll show up on Sunday.
[294:44.57]We'll see.
[294:49.59]Keep an eye on the sus.
[294:50.39]It might change.
[294:52.30]It definitely won't be later than Monday, but it could be Sunday.
[294:56.23]It won't be.
[294:56.53]It's not going to be Tuesday.
[294:58.85]It's not going to be Tuesday.
[295:01.61]It's going to be at some point as at some point as of Monday, there will be a stream.
[295:07.92]Sunday or Monday.
[295:19.12]But that is the end.
[295:20.16]Have a great night.
[295:21.00]See you guys later.
[295:22.71]See you on Monday or Sunday.
[295:25.43]He's going to delay to Wednesday.
[295:26.65]No, I will not.
[295:32.93]I will not delay till Wednesday.
[295:40.57]Thanks for sticking around.
[295:41.21]Thanks for hanging out.
[295:42.83]It's on Steam.
[295:43.47]Zoombinis is on Steam if you feel like playing it.
[295:47.71]It was a good time.
[295:48.15]Thanks for hanging out.
[295:49.05]See you guys on Monday.
[295:52.21]Or so.
[295:59.93]Somebody said, nah, I'm good.
[296:01.35]That is so much more.
[296:04.05]Alright.
[296:06.08]They're like, nah, I'm good.
[296:07.26]It's so much worse than no.
[296:11.92]Than just saying no.
[296:13.70]Don't you think so?
[296:15.58]Saying I'm good means you've really thought about it and were like, nah, nah, fucking I'm good.
[296:21.68]That would make it bad.
[296:23.54]I'm good over here.
[296:25.02]To me, that's more insulting than just saying no.
[296:29.99]Like, oh, you gonna be there on Monday?
[296:32.21]No.
[296:33.23]Oh, okay, cool.
[296:35.79]Hey, you gonna be there on Monday?
[296:36.89]Nah, I'm good.
[296:39.41]Because to me, I'm good means...
[296:42.53]I thought about it and the answer is no.
[296:44.17]No means there could be something else going on that you're missing the stream for.
[296:48.23]You got homework.
[296:49.27]You got friends are coming over.
[296:50.55]You got some stuff to do.
[296:51.98]You don't feel like watching Twitch.
[296:53.76]That, you know, it could mean anything.
[296:55.24]I'm good means you've already thought about it.
[297:00.26]Ban that person for life, by the way.
[297:01.56]Alright.
[297:02.98]I'll see you guys later.
[297:03.58]Thanks for watching.
