[00:06.10]I told you guys I was going to be early.
[00:07.34]I told you.
[00:13.34]I mean, I'm only five minutes early, but I'm still early.
[00:15.85]Still counts.
[00:16.47]Still does.
[00:20.23]How you doing?
[00:26.80]We doing good?
[00:30.27]I gotta tweet this.
[00:34.26]Today, we're going to play some FMV games.
[00:39.12]One just came out.
[00:41.62]Which piqued my interest.
[00:46.63]We're going to play the first one.
[00:49.57]Is not late.
[00:50.41]No, I'm not late.
[00:53.11]I'm precisely on time.
[00:58.12]The first one is called American Hero.
[01:01.96]And apparently this game is like 25 years old and it was never released.
[01:12.20]So some company, I guess they like got 90% of the way through development and they just didn't finish the game.
[01:21.09]So some random indie company, I don't see what the name of the company is.
[01:25.73]I kind of forget, uh, got all the footage and actually released it.
[01:33.00]So, this is a very old game.
[01:35.39]I'm very interested in this one.
[01:38.53]You're a hipster king.
[01:43.97]Well, not really.
[01:45.21]This thing's on the Nintendo Switch right now.
[01:47.52]So, not really.
[01:53.44]I didn't go get this on some secret place.
[01:57.49]You can literally get this on Switch right now.
[02:06.77]What about Monster Breeder?
[02:08.63]It's possible we play Monster Breeder later.
[02:11.85]Today.
[02:13.07]It really depends on how long these take.
[02:15.66]Because with some FMV games, some of these games are 40 minutes.
[02:20.12]Some of them are 3 hours.
[02:22.52]It really depends on how many.
[02:23.50]Maybe if we play through it again.
[02:25.02]If we move on to the next one.
[02:27.34]I don't know.
[02:27.60]It depends.
[02:30.07]We'll see.
[02:39.09]We can play Among Us.
[02:40.39]It's never going to happen.
[02:43.60]It's going to be awful or bad.
[02:45.12]Is that what you said?
[02:49.64]Did I read that wrong?
[02:50.76]Is it going to be awful or bad?
[02:55.60]What about the Goosebumps FMV with Jeff Goldblum?
[02:59.54]I did not even know that existed, but now that I know that exists, I'm very interested.
[03:03.35]I'm like an FMV wine connoisseur.
[03:07.32]It doesn't matter how bad they are.
[03:08.44]It doesn't matter how shitty they are.
[03:10.24]I have to play them.
[03:12.86]All of them.
[03:13.64]If I can.
[03:21.04]Also, I want to make this really clear.
[03:22.61]There was a content warning on this game.
[03:26.57]Apparently it's pretty dated.
[03:29.20]I don't know exactly what that means.
[03:31.92]But like I said, it's on the Switch.
[03:34.44]I don't know how... I don't exactly know what to be looking for.
[03:38.20]But we'll be on the ready.
[03:44.09]Are you going to stream Bad Mojo?
[03:53.32]Probably not.
[03:58.67]So, if we do come across something that's fucking shitty and bad, you know, just fucking behave yourselves.
[04:06.61]Come on.
[04:07.47]Come on, Gwen.
[04:07.91]You know what I mean?
[04:17.17]Are you gonna stream Crab Game?
[04:21.34]No, I- I- No.
[04:24.26]No, I- I don't- Every one of these games it takes off, I don't play them.
[04:30.13]I watch... Okay.
[04:33.65]This... With, like, trends on Twitch, it's kind of like how a lot of people jump into, like, the stock market and stuff.
[04:42.52]It's like, a game will come along, and I'll go, that looks kind of cool.
[04:46.02]I would like to maybe try that out.
[04:47.30]That looks like a great experience.
[04:49.90]And then I don't play it.
[04:51.52]And then two or three weeks later, it's... It's incredibly popular, and everyone's on it.
[04:57.18]oh that's awesome I probably should have maybe I could get in now nah I don't think I'm gonna get it I you know maybe it looks fun now it's like the biggest thing on Twitch the biggest the biggest thing in the world I don't want to buy the top of the crab game meta you know what I mean stop calling me a hipster why are you saying that
[05:25.27]don't you stream McDonald's hamburger adventure I don't even know what you're talking about alright you guys ready apparently this is gonna something else I read about this too is the actor that's in this they had to have him re-record lines
[05:46.70]with the restoration and I mean the guy's like almost 25 plus years older than he is so I don't know how that's gonna play out but it might be pretty funny but this is American hero I am ready our choices matter apparently are you gonna play Fortnite or should I just go
[06:13.78]You liar.
[06:15.48]You're a... How many months sub?
[06:16.92]You're a six month subscriber.
[06:18.32]You've been here for six months.
[06:21.73]You know what happens on this channel.
[06:23.35]You're a liar.
[06:23.97]You're lying to everybody.
[06:27.09]Alright, you ready?
[06:27.49]Let's go.
[06:29.53]This is American Hero.
[06:35.26]Viewer discretion is advised, apparently.
[06:40.30]And let's go.
[06:42.02]You ready?
[06:42.32]Okay.
[06:47.23]Oh, by the way, very important, that's the guy from That's My Bush from Comedy Central.
[06:51.62]I don't know if anyone remembers that show.
[07:03.08]That was a really weird reference, but here we go.
[07:05.92]American Hero.
[07:10.30]Yeah, okay, well, right off the bat.
[07:15.25]Right off the bat.
[07:16.69]I hope there's, uh... I don't think there's any nudity.
[07:21.37]I hope not.
[07:21.99]No, there's not.
[07:22.77]Oh, God.
[07:28.28]My home away from home.
[07:34.16]It's... I... Crystal's looking good today.
[07:38.88]I think that's the voiceover.
[07:40.72]I think that's the new line.
[07:44.20]Asshole.
[07:47.29]There is nudity?
[07:48.41]No, there's not.
[07:49.89]It's on the Switch.
[07:50.87]It can't be.
[07:52.29]It's on the Nintendo Switch.
[07:53.45]It's impossible.
[07:54.83]They don't allow any nudity on the Switch.
[07:56.61]That's a lie.
[07:57.58]It can't be possible.
[08:03.32]Here's trouble.
[08:06.35]B.F.D.
[08:07.24]Why does it sound like he's in a bathroom?
[08:09.10]Dangerous.
[08:09.66]Okay.
[08:30.36]It looks like Borderlands characters.
[08:31.36]It looks weird.
[08:31.84]Why?
[08:32.08]You're a big fucking dork.
[08:33.18]Alright, let me pay attention to the game.
[08:34.30]I have to make a decision here.
[08:35.46]What do I want to do?
[08:56.28]Bad news or party?
[09:00.10]What?
[09:01.00]What's going on?
[09:04.36]What'd I do?
[09:04.80]What just happened?
[09:11.85]Did he leave?
[09:17.81]Holy shit.
[09:19.05]Am I gonna get run over by a car?
[09:21.09]Why is there a truck?
[09:24.22]Do I have to move?
[09:27.07]Is it QTE?
[09:28.55]What do I do?
[09:35.43]What do I do?
[09:37.45]Run!
[09:38.41]Run!
[09:39.31]I'm gonna... I'm gonna drop.
[09:50.99]I'm gonna drop.
[09:53.26]He's gonna get run over.
[10:01.42]New item unlocked?
[10:05.54]Oh shit!
[10:13.61]What?
[10:13.87]But wait, hold on a second.
[10:16.03]Hold on.
[10:27.48]I was in a strip club, and then I was either gonna go do this mission or stay in the strip club, and then he left the strip club, started running away from a... somebody in a Mack truck?
[10:40.69]That ran my whole body over lengthwise, which is fucking crazy.
[10:44.76]I got steamrolled.
[10:46.76]Okay, alright.
[10:49.32]Oh, Jesus, we have to do this again.
[10:50.72]I don't want to have to show this again.
[10:52.24]I...
[10:56.37]Alright, what should I do?
[10:57.25]Should I... I'm gonna go get the bad news.
[10:59.95]I'm not clicking party on a game that has been confirmed to have nudity in it.
[11:03.11]No way.
[11:04.00]Not gonna happen.
[11:05.68]Nope, not happening.
[11:08.42]My home away from home.
[11:13.58]I could run over lengthwise.
[11:15.48]It ran over from my heels to the top of my head.
[11:20.07]That was insane.
[11:22.46]something against me making a living relax just carrot juice pinhead I I missed that last time as well he's drinking carrot juice I don't get it I don't believe there's nudity on the switch here's trouble they were right so now you can piss off
[11:51.76]It's Colonel.
[11:52.40]BFD.
[11:54.29]The old man has a problem.
[11:55.91]I'm not clicking party.
[11:57.93]I'm not interested.
[11:59.39]I'm through.
[12:00.65]It involves Laura and a dangerous mind control virus.
[12:09.83]Shit.
[12:11.09]Fuck, I didn't mean to click that.
[12:13.46]They think she's been kidnapped.
[12:14.78]Can't say more.
[12:17.75]Upscaled with AI.
[12:18.71]It does actually.
[12:21.63]I'm actually kind of glad it looks like this because some of the old FMV games we played in the past, they look like absolute dog shit.
[12:28.48]So this doesn't really even look that bad.
[12:30.28]Alright.
[12:31.74]No.
[12:32.04]No party.
[12:33.02]No.
[12:34.88]I have to get this right.
[12:35.54]It's like a rhythm game.
[12:38.00]Bad news.
[12:39.44]Bad news.
[12:40.10]Bad news.
[12:41.56]Bad news.
[12:42.64]Bad news.
[12:43.70]Bad news.
[12:45.18]I clicked bad news.
[12:47.50]I clicked bad news.
[12:48.88]I don't want to run away from the fucking truck.
[12:52.78]I clicked bad news.
[12:54.99]I clicked.
[12:57.09]What the fuck?
[12:58.03]No, I'm... How do I skip the cutscene?
[13:00.97]I'm not going to get run over again.
[13:06.94]The truck is bad news.
[13:08.50]Oh.
[13:09.08]No, it's not.
[13:09.54]I didn't do anything last time.
[13:10.68]Alright.
[13:10.84]Alright, this time don't drop.
[13:15.13]This time I'm gonna... I'm gonna go for the ledge.
[13:20.47]A ledge.
[13:20.95]Ledge.
[13:21.53]Run.
[13:22.47]A ledge.
[13:23.56]Run.
[13:24.04]Ledge.
[13:24.48]A ledge.
[13:25.12]Ledge!
[13:25.58]Run.
[13:27.84]Is he doing it?
[13:30.39]He's not making decisions.
[13:32.17]What the fuck?
[13:36.46]I can't do anything.
[13:37.70]Do you hear me clicking?
[13:39.72]Do you hear this?
[13:50.12]Why doesn't the game work?
[13:55.58]Mouse one.
[13:56.22]I'm clicking mouse one.
[13:58.03]Be brave the way Jack would watch that be.
[14:00.90]Ashes to ashes.
[14:02.76]Dust to dust.
[14:06.96]Oh, this is not good.
[14:08.66]It's not right click.
[14:09.42]It's left click, right?
[14:10.26]Maybe I should unplug the controller.
[14:12.67]I don't think I have one plugged in.
[14:17.71]I mean, the mouse apps.
[14:18.81]Yeah, that's left click.
[14:22.55]I don't think.
[14:22.90]No, there's no controller plugged in.
[14:24.50]It's just my mouse.
[14:27.96]I was spamming, too.
[14:32.21]10-second reaction time.
[14:35.67]Try right-clicking?
[14:36.51]Hold on.
[14:38.82]Options.
[14:39.42]Theoretical screen.
[14:42.26]Set keys.
[14:42.94]Okay.
[14:45.82]Select.
[14:46.94]Left-click, right?
[14:47.96]Yeah.
[14:49.18]Action.
[14:49.84]Space.
[14:51.74]Why would it say left-click?
[14:59.51]Okay.
[15:01.25]Okay.
[15:03.05]I guess I'm gonna try to hit space?
[15:07.72]It's also up, down, left, right as well.
[15:11.84]Well, I'll try space.
[15:13.34]God damn it.
[15:16.98]Alright, I'll try space.
[15:19.95]You better believe I'm gonna try to make sure this- get this to work.
[15:23.29]You don't get run over lengthwise by a car like that and not, like, play out at least some of the game.
[15:27.51]Are you kidding me?
[15:28.45]No way.
[15:28.73]Alright, let me see what happens.
[15:35.06]tutorial doesn't give you it just tells you um like the gist of the game I read it already alright can I skip this cutscene how do you skip cutscene escape there's definitely a way to do it enter just tap I mean tab works my home away from home right click
[16:02.23]No, there's definitely a way to do it backspace.
[16:03.73]Crystal's looking good today.
[16:05.10]I'm going to see if space works.
[16:12.36]Pinhead.
[16:14.42]Why are you making us watch this?
[16:15.98]I'm not making you watch this again.
[16:18.98]I'm trying.
[16:19.70]The game's controls are not accurate.
[16:30.77]Here's trouble.
[16:34.69]They were right.
[16:35.39]So now you can piss off, Sergeant Hoover.
[16:39.03]It's Colonel Hoover.
[16:40.07]BFD.
[16:41.57]The old man has a problem.
[16:42.99]He needs your help.
[16:45.39]Not interested.
[16:46.23]Bad news.
[16:46.93]Space.
[16:48.05]If it doesn't work, then I don't know what I'm going to do.
[16:51.58]Restart the game?
[16:55.86]Should I plug a controller in?
[16:57.12]Shit.
[16:57.76]We think she's been kidnapped.
[16:59.08]Can't say more.
[17:01.22]Walls have ears.
[17:02.98]If you're interested, meet me somewhere a little more private.
[17:06.15]Okay, let's see.
[17:12.01]Space.
[17:13.73]A rock in a hard place.
[17:17.84]Come on, please work.
[17:20.94]Please work.
[17:23.72]Bad news.
[17:24.78]Alright, it's space.
[17:26.80]It's fucking space.
[17:30.81]What is that meter at the top?
[17:34.90]I knew you'd make the right choice.
[17:36.98]Okay, Colonel.
[17:38.18]This better be good.
[17:39.86]I hope I still get run over by a fucking truck.
[17:44.77]I'm sure Laura would be impressed.
[17:48.63]I'm not here on a social visit.
[17:50.67]So many cigarettes.
[17:52.30]Kruger's escaped.
[17:53.26]He's up to his old tricks.
[17:54.34]Laura was working for us.
[17:55.96]She developed an antivirus formula.
[17:59.09]They kidnapped her before she could get it to us.
[18:01.45]Tell me about the virus.
[18:02.94]The old man will do that.
[18:04.60]What matters is you want Laura.
[18:06.90]We want the antivirus formula.
[18:11.72]Okay.
[18:12.04]No, that's not Nick Cage.
[18:13.22]What do you think, Jack?
[18:15.42]Can you get it up for another... Fuck you.
[18:18.62]Yes.
[18:19.62]Fuck you.
[18:20.62]Yes.
[18:21.42]Fuck you.
[18:22.72]Yes.
[18:23.04]What just happened?
[18:25.39]I just blacked out.
[18:26.53]What?
[18:30.31]Why did I black out?
[18:32.05]What was the point of blacking out?
[18:36.81]Oh, it's censored!
[18:39.09]What?
[18:40.33]Lemo?
[18:41.37]Lemo?
[18:42.45]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[18:43.49]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[18:44.84]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[18:46.68]No, no, no, no!
[18:47.52]It's on the Switch!
[18:48.52]It's on the Switch!
[18:49.12]It's on the Nintendo Switch!
[18:49.98]It's not gonna happen!
[18:51.77]It's not going to happen.
[18:53.11]It's on the Nintendo Switch.
[18:54.81]You should drink a big water.
[18:55.78]That's it.
[18:56.12]It's on the Nintendo Switch.
[18:56.70]It's not going to happen.
[18:57.32]Things are looking up.
[18:58.42]No, they're not.
[18:58.84]No, they're not.
[18:59.86]I have to get out of this.
[19:00.80]That's three options.
[19:01.98]I think I'm playing a fucking Mario Party game where I have to hit the dice at the right time.
[19:05.90]Give me a break.
[19:06.62]That's weird.
[19:07.94]I don't... Okay, get out.
[19:08.62]Leave.
[19:09.64]Leave.
[19:10.10]Leave before I hit the escape button.
[19:12.67]Leave.
[19:14.51]Run.
[19:17.29]Come back.
[19:18.29]No, leave!
[19:18.87]Leave now.
[19:19.25]Leave now.
[19:19.59]Actually, I gotta get out.
[19:20.96]I'm out.
[19:21.20]I'm out.
[19:21.46]I'm out.
[19:21.66]I'm out.
[19:22.50]Skip.
[19:22.72]How do I skip?
[19:23.44]Skip.
[19:23.80]Skip.
[19:24.16]Skip.
[19:24.40]Get out.
[19:26.48]No, I'm not fucking doing this.
[19:27.74]Not gonna happen.
[19:28.94]It's on the Nintendo Switch.
[19:30.08]She was just drinking water.
[19:30.84]That's it.
[19:33.00]Not gonna happen.
[19:36.56]I didn't even want to do this.
[19:37.66]It's this control system.
[19:40.48]Just watch it.
[19:42.34]There's no nudity, right?
[19:45.04]What's the matter?
[19:45.88]If there's nudity, I'm out.
[19:47.07]No, I'm out already.
[19:48.39]Tell me what's wrong, Simpson.
[19:53.23]Here comes the finale.
[19:57.95]No.
[20:05.58]You don't say, here comes the finale.
[20:08.70]And, uh... No, I'm not happy.
[20:12.01]I'm sorry.
[20:14.08]I have a clean record with Twitch.
[20:16.82]I've never been suspended.
[20:18.14]I've never had a terms of service problem.
[20:20.88]If I let her drop her hair and I'm assuming potentially some of her clothing material, this is not going to happen.
[20:28.05]Nope.
[20:29.09]I know that's possible.
[20:29.93]So here's what I'm going to do.
[20:31.41]I'll meet you halfway.
[20:33.35]I'm going to censor the screen for a second.
[20:36.51]And I'll let you know how it goes.
[20:43.92]Yeah, what the?
[20:45.72]Yeah, what the?
[20:47.74]Yeah, what the?
[20:50.72]I think it's okay.
[20:51.20]I think we're okay.
[20:53.31]We're good so far.
[20:53.99]I don't know what he's looking at.
[20:59.09]I don't know what he's looking at.
[21:01.23]What the fuck?
[21:06.20]What is even happening?
[21:09.98]Is she killing me?
[21:11.38]What the what?
[21:21.52]What is it?
[21:22.58]Boombox.
[21:23.60]Escape.
[21:24.14]Escape, dude.
[21:26.39]I have no- She sat on me.
[21:29.41]I'm so confused.
[21:41.90]I'm so-
[21:44.04]I don't even know what to say.
[21:45.06]This has been insane.
[21:48.29]This has been absolutely insane.
[21:49.63]I don't even know what to say.
[21:52.89]Um... I jumped out of a window, but I don't even know where the window went.
[22:01.56]Okay.
[22:08.18]No, I want to go back and do what I wanted to do.
[22:11.82]I want to do what I wanted to do in the first place.
[22:17.37]I want a new game.
[22:23.40]Yes.
[22:24.10]New game.
[22:25.06]I want to do what I was trying to do before.
[22:29.24]I'm not going to get soft locked into that.
[22:32.68]I wanted to take the limo.
[22:35.31]Guys, I'm going to play through this like 30 times.
[22:36.47]Don't worry.
[22:47.34]Uh, this has been fucking hilarious so far.
[22:50.50]Okay, let's try it.
[22:53.10]Here we go.
[22:54.26]Oh god dammit, I'm locked in.
[22:56.86]I like have to- I actually have to fucking do this.
[22:59.79]The game won't let me do it.
[23:06.01]Okay, well then boombox is the right answer then I think, right?
[23:11.42]Things are looking up.
[23:18.70]I can't just skip the cutscene.
[23:19.70]Give me a break.
[23:20.36]Whatever.
[23:28.31]Remember, you're walking on eggshells.
[23:31.81]I'm very aware.
[23:32.63]I'm very aware.
[23:34.07]So that's...
[23:45.49]She's just... Wait a minute.

[24:46.80]Gotta get enough feedback.
[24:52.71]I'm trying to feedback this thing?
[24:54.65]Oh, it hurts me in real life, though.
[24:56.81]Alright.
[25:02.13]Oh, shit.
[25:04.41]Get out.
[25:05.43]Take it.
[25:06.39]Get out.
[25:07.69]Take it.
[25:07.97]Take that, whatever that is.
[25:09.75]I'm not jumping out the window again.
[25:10.83]It kills you.

[25:29.39]Shortcut.
[25:30.39]Laura's.
[25:36.33]Limmo.
[25:37.19]Cut through.
[25:38.29]Limmo.
[25:38.79]Limmo.
[25:39.19]Cut through.
[25:39.73]Took me a long time to get here.
[25:46.42]I've died like four times.
[25:48.46]I believe Laura's my wife?
[25:50.35]Let's check that toaster.
[26:09.68]This guy's reading like a parent that's just barely getting through a story at story time with a kid late at night.
[26:17.95]Jack, Kruger's using them for random acts of violence, from single murders to full-scale riots.
[26:25.12]We don't know how Kruger was spreading the damn thing, but we've heard that he's working on a sophisticated delivery system which will release the virus everywhere.
[26:34.00]Los Angeles is the target.
[26:36.06]Yes, it's the target.
[26:37.50]You're the only man for this one, Jack.
[26:40.01]But for God's sake, man, keep your shorts on.
[26:43.35]We're running out of time.
[26:44.46]Hold on, I'm gonna turn the game volume up.
[26:48.96]I turned it down because of the feedback.
[26:50.32]We got a raid?
[26:50.74]What's the raid from?
[26:52.60]We got a raid from RT.
[26:54.19]What's up, RT?
[26:55.35]RT game crowd.
[26:57.44]Welcome, everybody.
[26:59.48]I'm going to give you a very, very quick warning.
[27:01.38]We're playing a game that's got some pretty fucked up themes, I guess.
[27:07.14]It's an old FMV game.
[27:08.95]It just released.
[27:09.49]It's on the Nintendo Switch, though.
[27:11.31]It's on the Switch.
[27:13.05]Therefore, you know, I don't think there'll be very much nudity or anything like that.
[27:16.19]Just know that it's on the Switch.
[27:20.21]But welcome, everybody.
[27:21.15]Thanks a lot for the raid.
[27:26.80]I turned it off.
[27:28.38]Jack, I know you're going to need it.
[27:30.86]Yes, sir.
[27:33.26]Thank you, General.
[27:35.64]Alright, we can go now.
[27:38.70]Wait, I'm not even going anywhere?
[27:39.76]I'm just getting out of the limo.
[27:42.28]Why didn't we go somewhere?
[27:45.92]Wait, didn't I just do this?
[27:48.98]Laura's KVK.
[27:50.99]Laura's KVK.
[27:53.01]Laura's KVK.
[27:57.54]That was too loud.
[27:58.18]Yeah, those things are loud.
[28:03.16]Door looks open.
[28:03.78]Looks like somebody may have gotten in.
[28:07.02]Gate.
[28:07.68]Door.
[28:08.38]Climb.
[28:09.02]Gate.
[28:09.66]Door.
[28:10.36]Climb.
[28:10.80]Holy shit, you got up there quick.
[28:22.19]Anybody home?
[28:23.79]Why is he so much louder than everything else?
[28:27.18]The internal monologue is so loud.
[28:31.10]Laura's left your purse.
[28:32.59]Money in there.
[28:35.67]Looks like Mark Zuckerberg.
[28:36.89]Can't stop.
[28:40.23]Forget it.
[28:41.23]Need it.
[28:42.19]Forget it.
[28:43.25]Need it.
[28:43.65]I'll take it.
[28:44.79]What is it, like 200 bucks?
[28:47.39]200 bucks in like 1990 was like fucking eight grand, so I'll take it.
[28:51.19]Mmm.
[28:51.93]Gotta go.
[28:53.15]Mmm.
[28:53.96]Gotta go.
[28:55.87]Wait, was I gonna take a shower?
[28:59.09]Krueger's goons.
[29:01.83]Oh, goons.
[29:09.14]Oh, shit.
[29:10.54]Oh, they're telling me.
[29:18.07]I can lose these creeps.
[29:20.77]How?
[29:21.21]What am I gonna do?
[29:21.75]Climb the telephone pole?
[29:27.04]Hell of a day and it's only two.
[29:29.46]Did I lose them?
[29:30.92]Wait, hold on.
[29:34.29]What?
[29:36.09]Holy shit.
[29:37.75]Alright, well now I know how to play.
[29:41.17]I'm going for the legend.
[29:51.43]Same scene?
[29:51.95]I think you have to get hit by the truck.
[29:57.74]A ledge.
[29:58.78]Run.
[30:00.38]I think run is death.
[30:01.28]What do I press?
[30:02.68]What do I press?
[30:06.76]Holy shit.
[30:07.14]Alright, I did that sequence.
[30:15.43]This guy's just walking in circles.
[30:21.15]Wait, who...
[30:24.70]They're still on me.
[30:25.56]Behind me?
[30:26.52]Still?
[30:27.85]Were they there for the truck?
[30:32.75]Cab.
[30:33.11]My ride.
[30:37.27]Run.
[30:37.99]Fight.
[30:38.33]My ride.
[30:39.27]Run.
[30:39.95]Fight.
[30:40.25]Fight.
[30:41.13]I can take him.
[30:45.39]Nice.
[30:47.27]That wasn't really a fight.
[30:48.07]I just kind of pushed.
[30:48.89]Run.
[30:49.15]Nice.
[30:55.84]You want some too?
[30:57.08]Bring it on.
[31:03.38]Ah, the tried and true henchmen stormtrooper routine.
[31:06.26]You just don't have a helmet on.
[31:18.60]Holy shit.
[31:21.78]Jack, it's back.
[31:25.29]Alright, well, now they're not going to be following me anymore, right?
[31:30.15]Super cab.
[31:31.83]What took you so long?
[31:32.65]Drive, drive, just drive.
[31:33.91]Alright, here we go.
[31:37.50]Alright, where are we going?
[31:41.62]Where the hell are you?
[31:42.66]The old man sent me, told me to keep an eye on you.
[31:44.42]He said you needed it.
[31:46.24]Nice timing.
[31:47.50]Don't distract him.
[31:48.32]Don't hit him while he's driving.
[31:49.76]Looks like we got some coming.
[31:52.52]Got a gun?
[31:52.82]Step on it.
[31:57.95]Is he driving a hearse?
[32:03.24]Okay, here we go!
[32:09.04]They're shooting a shotgun.
[32:14.79]Isn't that not that effective?
[32:16.93]Why would you shoot a shotgun when it's far away?
[32:24.73]they are kind of close right here we go left right how about driving the car isn't this his decision not mine oh you're dead
[32:56.79]Why is all this stuff everywhere?
[32:58.39]There's too much stuff.
[32:59.99]Brakes.
[33:00.41]Gas.
[33:01.51]Fight.
[33:01.83]Brakes.
[33:02.59]Gas.
[33:03.51]Fight.
[33:07.58]I blacked out again.
[33:09.72]Why is there so much cardboard?
[33:19.74]Can we get him?
[33:24.90]What?
[33:29.17]oh my head hurts hold on alright be brave the way Jack would watch it ashes to ashes oh that was insane
[34:03.25]The part where he's driving, he's ripping the wheel back and forth.
[34:05.83]I'm not the one behind the wheel.
[34:08.19]I'm not driving the car.
[34:10.10]You folded like a lawn chair.
[34:16.40]Oh my god, that was so stupid.
[34:20.80]I know people are saying a certain thing.
[34:23.43]I'm just gonna just move on and stream.
[34:27.15]It's very funny.
[34:28.71]Oh my god damn it.
[34:31.11]What an American hero.
[34:38.57]Okay.
[34:40.15]This time, I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna fight this time.
[34:45.28]I'm gonna stay in the car.
[34:47.66]Hit the brakes.
[34:49.70]Get in front of him and just smash the brakes.
[34:54.36]You can't believe that happened.
[34:59.48]This game is insane.
[35:00.67]Hit the brakes.
[35:03.69]Hit the brakes.
[35:04.79]Hit the brakes.
[35:05.33]Brakes, yes.
[35:06.57]Fight.
[35:14.76]Got it.
[35:17.12]Nice.
[35:17.58]Alright.
[35:18.24]Good decision.
[35:18.76]Good call.
[35:19.93]I know we're going to be great friends.
[35:25.35]Wait, you're going to... Brakes.
[35:28.63]Gas.
[35:28.91]Brakes.
[35:29.31]Gas.
[35:29.91]Brakes.
[35:30.61]Gas.
[35:30.91]It's the school bus.
[35:33.88]No, you're not going to hit the school bus.
[35:35.30]I don't think they're going to do it, right?
[35:39.52]We're fine.
[35:46.79]No kids.
[35:48.13]It's my lucky day.
[35:51.53]We're good.
[35:51.91]I think... I think that's... Uh-oh.
[36:09.16]Alright, Noah.
[36:10.54]Be brave the way Jack would want you to be.
[36:13.42]Ashes to ashes.
[36:15.28]Dust to dust.
[36:17.39]I... I think that... I thought that was the right decision.
[36:21.54]It was not.
[36:21.98]The right decisions probably break.
[36:26.04]Aye yi yi.
[36:28.62]Okay.
[36:30.94]What if I hit gas?
[36:31.62]I'm curious about the other option.
[36:41.54]This game is having a nightmare.
[36:43.37]It is kind of having a nightmare.
[36:55.05]It's break break is the right play.
[36:58.61]We're gonna get the same ending.
[37:02.49]It's my lucky day Hey, do you smell gas
[37:32.30]This is outrageous.
[37:38.60]What was the budget for this game?
[37:46.37]I don't know, but the crazy story about this game is that you weren't here in the very beginning.
[37:51.01]This game was never released.
[37:53.99]Ever.
[37:56.00]It was done filming, and I don't know if the studio ran out of money or something, but it was never actually released.
[38:01.51]A new company came in and kind of remastered all the footage and restored it.
[38:06.71]It's the only reason why we're playing it today.
[38:12.22]Okay, it's break, break.
[38:24.10]Oh, it's because it was on the Jaguar, right?
[38:25.90]On the console flop.
[38:34.63]Alright, brakes.
[38:39.20]Brakes.
[38:41.00]Yes.
[38:42.72]We're not arguing about if we're going to go to McDonald's or Wendy's.
[38:45.90]We're talking about life and death here.
[38:52.44]There we go.
[38:52.96]Okay, we're good.
[38:54.56]On to the next sequence.
[39:01.87]Okay.
[39:22.35]What is this?
[39:26.67]Pretty tight security.
[39:31.78]Was this the lab?
[39:35.60]Why would I just walk to the front door like a fucking sim?
[39:39.08]That's a neighbor.
[39:40.30]What are you doing?
[39:40.90]Uh oh.
[39:54.80]What are you doing?
[40:05.41]He was wearing a suit under all that?
[40:06.83]Holy shit, he must be sweating.
[40:10.27]Good to see you again, Jack.
[40:13.51]Well, I was hoping it wouldn't be for at least another 40 years.
[40:17.39]Prison food was just too boring.
[40:20.53]Where's Laura?
[40:21.65]Everything in good time.
[40:25.23]Are they going to try to melt me into the chemical vat?
[40:28.85]Your glamorous city has one fatal design flaw.
[40:33.72]Can you guess what that is?
[40:36.08]Rush on.
[40:39.08]Los Angeles is built on near desert.
[40:42.86]Water keeps it alive.
[40:47.73]Try another 10 cc's.
[40:48.91]Uh oh.
[40:51.25]If someone were to infect
[40:54.42]This life's blood.
[40:56.90]Say, for instance, here.
[41:00.48]That was a fake hand.
[41:01.78]That was a rubber hand.
[41:04.16]I will release my virus into the system.
[41:07.88]Within minutes, the disease will ripple out exponentially.
[41:14.44]It will be the greatest biological conquest of all time.
[41:20.08]I no longer have to rely on this primitive but clever... Oh, that's why they're drinking the water out of the big bottles.
[41:27.62]After tonight, a new order shall prevail.
[41:32.35]My order.
[41:36.39]Another failed attempt at the antivirus?
[41:39.81]I will have that swing.
[41:43.10]Kill him.
[41:44.14]Uh oh.
[41:46.90]You sick.
[41:51.22]Sadistic bastard.
[41:54.51]I gotta be ready to turn and fight.
[41:57.33]Oh no.
[41:57.65]Am I gonna get like tortured?
[42:07.28]What information do I have anyways?
[42:11.16]I'm just like an agent.
[42:20.66]Oh, it's Laura.
[42:21.64]Give us a story recap so far.
[42:31.69]Um... I was in retirement.
[42:34.71]I came out of retirement to solve this madman poisoning the water supply.
[42:39.07]Done.
[42:39.31]What?
[42:39.57]What?! !
[42:50.64]Uh-oh.
[42:53.74]Oh no, they took away the light?
[42:57.50]Uh... That bulb is so expensive.
[43:05.42]That's very... Okay, we gotta think of a solution here.
[43:07.75]Quick.
[43:11.29]Uh... Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[43:16.95]Uh... Dude, the Metal Gear's solid.
[43:18.27]I'm sick.
[43:18.61]I have diarrhea.
[43:24.46]He's gonna get crushed.
[43:25.70]Why would you open the door without like a weapon?
[43:48.19]Yeah, I was in the middle of pressing the squish button.
[43:50.19]What do you want?
[43:52.14]What can I help you with?
[43:54.62]Oh, yeah.
[43:55.10]They told me never to do one thing.
[43:56.48]I forget what it was.
[43:57.22]I think it was don't ever open this fucking door when people are in it.
[44:08.37]That wasn't even cartoon logic.
[44:09.83]That was like they had a whole scene and like they had like that the scene they threw the whole scene away and they had to get an extra to be that guy.
[44:16.60]Like there was like a full 10 minutes of dialogue there.
[44:18.48]Left.
[44:19.48]Right.
[44:20.44]Left.
[44:21.40]That was a reshoot.
[44:22.44]Left.
[44:23.50]Right.
[44:26.59]They had a whole sequence with a guard.
[44:30.97]Oh shit they went left.
[44:37.17]Oh god.
[44:52.80]Oh, here we go.
[44:53.86]Oh, no.
[44:54.92]Don't push her into the way.
[45:03.90]Sound effect.
[45:07.77]If you type in punch sound effect on YouTube right now, that's the first.
[45:10.67]That's exactly the first one.
[45:17.25]I have not had a decision to make.
[45:18.47]They're just doing it on their own.
[45:21.49]The AI is just picking directions.
[45:23.07]Left.
[45:24.05]Right.
[45:24.37]Oh god.
[45:25.05]Left.
[45:26.09]Right.
[45:26.65]Right?
[45:26.95]That'll do.
[45:35.85]Holy shit, she's running way faster than me and she's in heels.
[45:39.51]That's crazy.
[45:45.83]Left.
[45:46.83]Right.
[45:47.09]Oh my god, I have no idea.
[45:48.21]Let's go left.
[45:48.87]Right.
[45:53.44]It was the same guy?
[45:54.36]This guy again.
[45:57.04]Okay, we're going to see this guy again.
[46:09.37]That's the wrong way.
[46:12.28]I think if you make the wrong decision, you go in a circle, you see that guy every time.
[46:16.32]We're going to see him again.
[46:28.01]Left.
[46:28.95]Right.
[46:29.95]Left.
[46:30.99]Right.
[46:31.31]Right?
[46:31.85]That'll do.
[46:40.22]We're about to loop again.
[46:41.24]Is that guy gonna get up again?
[46:42.92]Can I just shoot that guy?
[46:50.78]Left.
[46:51.78]Right.
[46:54.07]Alright, there's no way that guy comes back another time.
[47:13.80]It's not possible.
[47:15.94]You understand?
[47:17.52]It's not possible that guy's back.
[47:18.86]He flew off of a balcony like 15 feet away.
[47:22.16]No way.
[47:29.51]I need to know.
[47:30.27]I have to know if that guy's still alive.
[47:46.52]Somebody's watching these cameras.
[47:49.12]Just going, oh no he doesn't.
[47:52.26]They don't know.
[47:54.36]He's back again.
[47:55.92]What?
[48:00.35]Why is that?
[48:01.23]Single shots?
[48:05.85]There's two there now.
[48:16.78]Okay.
[48:18.78]Oh, no.
[48:19.28]We got the end card.
[48:22.46]Shit.
[48:27.86]no oh damn it alright well we'll get it we'll get it this time full auto bolt action uzi okay well this is this game's insane we have to get at least some kind of other ending
[48:56.84]I'm having far too much fun to stop playing this.
[48:59.27]Alright, let's go again.
[49:07.35]Let's try a new route, let's go.
[49:08.58]Wait, unlockables.
[49:11.58]Find every way to end the game at Jack's funeral.
[49:15.48]Reach all the endings where Jack survives.
[49:20.53]That finds a flat line like a pancake by 18 wheels of steel.
[49:23.83]Oh, these are all the choices.
[49:24.91]Alright, let's go.
[49:27.80]Oh, we can start from here.
[49:30.38]Sadistic bastard.
[49:35.02]What?
[49:36.18]Wait, what?
[49:37.34]What happened?
[49:38.06]Where's Laura?
[49:39.06]This didn't happen.
[49:39.88]Shoot me and you'll never see her again.
[49:43.55]This didn't.
[49:46.97]Kill him later.
[50:00.51]Shoot him in the head.
[50:04.80]You still have the gun.
[50:06.16]Shoot him in the face.
[50:13.82]You have the gun still.
[50:15.06]You still have the gun.
[50:20.61]Ashes to ashes.
[50:22.47]Dust to dust.
[50:25.93]Alright, alright.
[50:27.29]Be brave the way Jack would want you to be.
[50:34.09]I don't want to watch the credits again.
[50:40.69]Alright, I should just... Should I start the whole thing over?
[50:43.79]See if we can get to the end from here.
[50:56.35]I didn't do that before.
[50:57.95]I didn't punch the guy and grab the gun last time.
[51:07.33]Alright, what do you think?
[51:08.73]One's in the chat to just go from that checkpoint and try to keep going, or two in the chat if you want me to start the game over and go a different route.
[51:22.08]That looks pretty unanimously won.
[51:23.96]Alright, let's go.
[51:26.28]Sadistic bastard.
[51:28.52]Okay, so this time I'm not going to shoot.
[51:31.28]Grabbed a gun, apparently.
[51:34.02]Where's Laura?
[51:35.86]Shoot me.
[51:37.33]And you'll never see her again.
[51:40.21]Okay.
[51:40.75]Don't shoot.
[51:42.89]Kill him.
[51:43.89]Later.
[51:44.89]Kill him.
[51:45.91]Later.
[51:46.43]Later.
[51:46.69]Do they still shoot?
[51:56.80]Put him with a good doctor.
[51:58.56]So what, I don't... I just don't care about having the weapon?
[52:11.67]Bar is a fight or flight meter.
[52:13.38]Yeah, the more it's on the right side, it's aggression.
[52:15.32]The more it's on the left, it's running, right?
[52:18.82]We have to do this again.
[52:20.10]I need to play through this game one more time at least.
[52:22.68]It's too ridiculous not to see everything else.
[52:29.53]Try the hairpin.
[52:40.67]You overestimate how many past they shot.
[52:46.46]Apparently a lot.
[52:47.80]Apparently a lot of footage.
[52:50.68]Alright, let's try hairpin.
[53:03.25]I'm sorry it's so loud, but it kind of has to be.
[53:04.81]Otherwise, because there's no subtitles.
[53:05.99]Otherwise, you won't be able to hear anything.
[53:10.63]I hope we get smushed.
[53:13.17]What are you?
[53:14.07]What are you doing?
[53:18.91]What are you doing?
[53:24.14]What?
[53:42.56]Why?
[53:42.86]In the name of God.
[53:43.80]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[53:44.82]Oh, that guy's fucking reaction.
[53:47.14]Oh, I fucking, ugh.
[54:12.35]That guy just did like the butthead from Beavis and Butthead.
[54:15.99]Okay.
[54:16.31]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[54:17.90]I'm actually not going to show this.
[54:24.16]Come on.
[54:24.94]Alright, we're good.
[54:26.02]Hey.
[54:30.71]Escape in sector two.
[54:32.17]Escape in sector two.
[54:33.07]Go, go.
[54:40.53]Oh my god, they just let us open the door.
[54:44.21]Okay, don't screw this up.
[54:45.25]Okay, I'm gonna go right first.
[54:59.38]I went left first last time.
[55:03.48]Go right.
[55:11.02]Now we're gonna try, we're gonna go left.
[55:27.60]Wait, they just went left?
[55:32.70]Wait, here he is.
[55:33.70]Let me outta here.
[55:38.19]Okay, so now... Go left.
[55:52.82]Yeah, it's left.
[56:04.07]Left.
[56:05.07]Right.
[56:05.95]That'll do.
[56:07.46]Okay.
[56:08.74]I think we made it.
[56:13.48]Okay, now where?
[56:16.16]Right?
[56:16.46]I don't know.
[56:21.20]Wait, where do I go?
[56:22.70]Where do I go?
[56:23.56]Help me.
[56:24.68]Left.
[56:25.72]Right.
[56:27.03]Which way?
[56:28.27]Left.
[56:29.75]Right.
[56:32.03]No, it's back at this guy again.
[56:33.35]What are you talking about?
[56:34.83]No, I'm not.
[56:35.47]This can't happen again.
[56:36.21]Oh, fuck.
[56:39.09]Just stay right.
[56:39.89]Right, right, right only.
[56:40.75]Right only.
[56:41.11]Right, right, right.
[56:43.85]Left and then left again.
[56:47.62]It's left and then right.
[56:53.72]Left and right.
[56:55.28]Stay right.
[56:56.44]Left and then left.
[56:59.30]Left, right.
[57:01.24]Left, left.
[57:02.64]Left and right.
[57:03.24]Left and right.
[57:03.82]Left and right.
[57:05.32]Not left.
[57:06.48]No, it's left.
[57:08.81]Left.
[57:09.81]Right.
[57:10.77]Okay, left, then right.
[57:18.24]Chat, chat, stop.
[57:19.34]Are you trying to get me killed?
[57:20.46]I have no idea what's going on.
[57:21.98]I think it's right.
[57:25.08]Left, left?
[57:28.28]Left is right.
[57:29.18]No, stop.
[57:29.82]Left, right?
[57:31.43]Left.
[57:31.85]What do I do?
[57:32.49]Right.
[57:34.45]Oh, goddammit.
[57:35.51]Stop doing this to me.
[57:36.37]What do I do?
[57:37.17]Right?
[57:38.48]Not again.
[57:40.22]What's the first one?
[57:42.56]I don't know.
[57:44.92]Just do left, left?
[57:46.84]No, right, right.
[57:47.80]Right twice.
[57:48.40]Alright, I'm gonna try right, right.
[57:51.06]Alright, right twice.
[57:55.12]Come on.
[57:58.30]Right, right.
[58:07.96]Right.
[58:09.84]Left.
[58:10.88]Right.
[58:11.16]Okay.
[58:11.52]Right.
[58:12.02]Right.
[58:16.16]What?
[58:16.60]You hear that?
[58:17.38]Did I do it?
[58:17.80]Should we go back?
[58:19.30]I got it.
[58:19.62]Relax.
[58:19.76]You know what that sounds like?
[58:22.68]Ventilation system.
[58:23.34]That means there's a way out.
[58:24.46]Look.
[58:24.60]Alright.
[58:25.70]Through the vent.
[58:31.15]Bingo.
[58:31.67]The formula.
[58:32.59]And a place to make the antidote.
[58:34.33]They filmed this in a high school classroom.
[58:41.33]Sneak in.
[58:42.19]Break in.
[58:43.31]Sneak in.
[58:43.81]Break in.
[58:44.13]Oh, wait, I'm breaking in with the axe.
[58:45.39]You better believe it.
[58:50.69]We're gonna- Here's Johnny, these motherfuckers.
[58:53.19]Oh, I told you you did that, Jerry!
[58:58.08]You moved two decibels!
[59:08.87]Hurry up.
[59:09.51]Hurry up.
[59:10.61]Kill him first.
[59:12.29]Don't move.
[59:13.79]Hey, Paul.
[59:21.08]Excuse me.
[59:21.68]Is that the only way out of here?
[59:23.42]Uh-huh.
[59:23.90]Don't move.
[59:28.38]Well, actually.
[59:29.38]Laura.
[59:37.11]This is where you're going to get off.
[59:38.99]I'm going to take Kruger down at the reservoir and there's no place for you.
[59:42.02]I want you to find a safe place.
[59:44.08]I'll see you when it's over.
[59:45.62]I want to be with you, Jack.
[59:49.32]Oh, they caught up to us.
[59:51.02]Let's take a full 10 to 15 seconds to kiss.
[59:53.38]Don't worry about the automatic assault weapons that are right here.
[59:57.94]This is a long shot.
[60:06.33]Do it.
[60:07.37]Forget it.
[60:08.29]Do it.
[60:08.73]What?
[60:09.35]Forget it.
[60:09.89]Do it.
[60:10.49]What do you mean forget it?
[60:11.41]Forget it.
[60:11.93]Wait, just go back to the strip club?
[60:24.06]Who is that?
[60:26.61]Who is that?
[60:34.24]Are we on this team?
[60:36.66]Alright, why is this guy dressed like Dick Tracy?
[61:02.22]Among Us?
[61:03.12]It's yellow from Among Us.
[61:07.75]Whose team are these people in?
[61:15.29]Oh, this is me.
[61:19.06]Don't -2 me.
[61:20.00]-2 the people in chat that said that.
[61:21.30]I was just reacting to it.
[61:23.72]Let's go.
[61:31.70]Don't touch.
[61:32.16]Those are like electrified.
[61:36.10]He's definitely... He's saying snake?
[61:40.07]Snake!
[61:53.48]Oh, wait a minute.
[61:54.44]Goodbye, Hoover.
[61:55.72]Goodbye, Kruger.
[61:57.38]Double cross.
[62:21.71]Or the lab.
[62:22.27]Or is there another option?
[62:26.96]Or is this it?
[62:57.73]This guy's really desperate to get the old Butterfinger recipe back.
[63:06.05]It wasn't poison after all.
[63:17.38]It's just not the same in the middle.
[63:21.30]He's trying to recreate it.
[63:30.41]Don't have much time.
[63:38.26]-2.
[63:39.14]Forced joke.
[63:40.00]Yeah.
[63:40.20]Yeah, I'll take the L on that one.
[63:43.80]Can I get a decision?
[63:45.50]Everything's set up there.
[63:47.50]Everything's set up there.
[63:57.88]This is gonna be a really bad one to have to redo.
[64:00.66]It's been people walking around, setting up for like five straight minutes.
[64:10.92]Kruger.
[64:11.55]Hoover.
[64:12.21]Drums.
[64:12.99]Kruger.
[64:13.55]Hoover.
[64:14.23]Drums.
[64:14.67]Kruger.
[64:15.59]Hoover.
[64:16.29]Drums.
[64:16.51]Uh... Shoot the red barrel.
[64:18.59]Don't shoot the drums!
[64:19.29]Call them off or you're dead!
[64:28.92]Nice job, son!
[64:30.28]Who the fuck was that?
[64:32.04]Why am I never looking behind me?
[64:36.47]They didn't hurt you, did they?
[64:37.45]Where's Laura?
[64:44.43]Where's Laura?
[64:51.82]Oh, that definitely probably sounded way better in the mirror.
[64:57.50]Two days ago.
[64:59.30]Oh no, I've been infected.
[65:21.47]Just a few seconds.
[65:34.10]Every cell in your body is gonna mutate.
[65:36.94]You're gonna be another one of Dr. Kruger's mindless zombies.
[65:40.38]A few seconds?
[65:44.50]What do you think I'm gonna do?
[65:47.12]I think I'm gonna ask that you be my own person.
[65:50.29]Wait, can you say that again?
[65:51.09]A plane drove over.
[65:54.47]Ruined your moment.
[65:55.17]Alright, three minutes.
[66:27.30]Didn't he say a few seconds?
[66:28.56]That turned into a few minutes.
[66:33.00]Did I?
[66:34.20]Is this the lose?
[66:34.92]Did I lose?
[66:38.07]Within three minutes, Los Angeles will be mine.
[66:42.47]Perhaps you might enjoy sharing it with me.
[66:49.50]Easy.
[66:50.20]You gotta spell that shit.
[66:53.84]So what do I do?
[66:57.95]uber kruger uber uh kruger what do I do I can't shoot him from up here what the no
[67:30.95]I hope the checkpoint's really close.
[67:49.37]I thought I was going to snipe him from all the way back there.
[67:53.41]That would have been so funny.
[68:05.72]I was right at the checkpoint.
[68:06.94]Good.
[68:07.66]Very good.
[68:19.78]I think it's time for this guy to go back to the drawing board.
[68:22.59]Mojo Jojo tried this like three times already.
[68:36.92]Alright, oh fuck.
[68:38.86]Oh god damn it.
[68:39.72]Alright, whatever.
[68:45.03]It's alright, it's alright.
[68:46.15]We just have to watch this whole thing again.
[68:48.07]Alright, this time I'm gonna... Who should I shoot?
[68:52.58]Should I point the gun at Hoover?
[68:57.51]Who should I point the gun at?
[68:58.65]Not the barrels, right?
[69:00.31]I thought the barrels was a great idea.
[69:01.68]I'm going to shoot the barrel, which is going to destroy everything.
[69:03.62]Everyone's going to get the virus or whatever all over them, right?
[69:06.72]That was like, okay.
[69:07.42]But then the guy just came behind me.
[69:10.50]The extra came behind me and hit me in the head.
[69:12.68]So how was I supposed to know that was going to happen?
[69:16.70]It's going to take forever.
[69:18.59]Yeah, I'm going to aim at Hoover.
[69:22.37]That's a good idea.
[69:30.31]Skip it.
[69:30.67]You can't skip cutscenes.
[69:31.43]You need to watch this every time.
[69:34.36]I think we'll get it this time.
[69:35.42]Skip?
[69:37.12]No way.
[69:38.84]Not in a hundred million years.
[70:09.50]Alright, we're going to aim the gun at Hoover.
[70:12.44]Because I feel like Hoover is going to be like, no, no, no, don't shoot me.
[70:14.74]Alright, hold on.
[70:15.48]This is what's going to happen.
[70:16.34]Don't shoot me.
[70:18.22]This guy's a snake, right?
[70:20.50]Goodbye, Hoover.
[70:21.80]Goodbye, Kruger.
[70:23.26]Big day.
[70:24.72]Very excited.
[70:28.45]Yeah.
[70:41.23]The guy looks like Joe Biden.
[70:43.11]It looks like somebody took young Joe Biden and put them in one of those Ageify apps to make old Joe Biden.
[70:49.96]That's what it looks like.
[71:14.66]Alright, we gotta aim at this guy.
[71:18.12]We have to go after him.
[71:19.86]Because I feel like we'll probably get another decision.
[71:24.51]Guns don't even have barrels.
[71:27.59]Really?
[71:32.07]Well, it gets the same message.
[71:43.29]Alright, here we go.
[71:45.37]Don't screw this up.
[71:46.37]I don't want to have to watch the first five minutes of every RTS phase.
[71:52.47]No, I don't want to watch this.
[71:56.50]Don't have much time.
[72:13.47]Okay, here we go.
[72:20.96]This is it.
[72:21.46]Hoover.
[72:28.52]Construction complete.
[72:30.14]Building.
[72:31.48]Building.
[72:32.72]Construction complete.
[72:34.42]Unit lost.
[72:35.68]Unit lost.
[72:37.10]Kruger.
[72:37.72]Hoover.
[72:38.38]Drums.
[72:40.80]What the fuck?
[72:41.68]Who did that?
[72:45.10]How did they not see me do that?
[72:53.78]I don't care about him.
[72:55.30]Yeah, I fucking knew it.
[72:56.41]God damn it.
[72:57.11]No, god damn it.
[72:58.15]No, god damn it.
[73:00.59]No!
[73:01.77]No!
[73:03.47]There's not even a muscle coming out of that fucking guy's gun.
[73:10.38]Oh, god damn it.
[73:13.66]We have to watch the whole thing again?
[73:17.62]Whatever.
[73:18.42]I can.
[73:19.10]Okay.
[73:19.54]Okay.
[73:21.85]Why would you pick the goon?
[73:23.03]I know I'm... I don't care about him.
[73:26.43]He's nothing to me.
[73:27.61]Kill him.
[73:28.11]It has to be the main guy.
[73:31.05]Can I even get to the main guy?
[73:32.33]I... God damn it.
[73:39.50]That's so funny.
[73:43.13]It has to be a way to skip.
[73:44.31]I really don't think there is.
[73:45.18]It's spaced?
[73:56.26]I don't know.
[73:56.84]I don't think it is.
[73:57.30]Yeah, hey, yeah, this is very important to remember.
[74:06.28]This is 25 years old.
[74:18.09]It's 25 years old.
[74:23.17]How old are these actors now?
[74:24.77]The craziest part is the main character recorded voice lines with this remaster.
[74:33.57]So how old is this main character here?
[74:34.91]Probably in his, I want to say probably either 40s maybe?
[74:40.31]Early 40s probably?
[74:42.47]So this person, the actor, might actually be in their late 60s into early 70s.
[74:57.51]Late 30s?
[74:58.43]Early 40s?
[74:58.83]Yeah.
[74:58.93]That's what I would think.
[75:00.99]Spam every button.
[75:03.57]No, it doesn't do anything.
[75:04.59]I'm telling you.
[75:06.37]There is no skip.
[75:08.61]Okay, he's George Bush from That's My Bush.
[75:13.37]It was on Comedy Central.
[75:14.91]He's almost as old as you are now.
[75:28.52]Now what?
[75:36.08]I forgot about That's My Bush.
[75:37.47]Yeah.
[75:38.97]That was, correct me if I'm wrong, but that was Trey Parker and Matt Stone made that show.
[75:44.17]Or at least Trey Parker did.
[75:46.19]South Park, guys.
[75:48.26]I think it was only live for like four episodes.
[75:50.44]Or like six episodes.
[75:58.31]Goodbye Hoover.
[75:59.61]Goodbye Kruger.
[76:02.47]Here we go.
[76:06.17]Don't screw this up.
[76:09.93]Bill Murray is on the crane.
[76:11.39]Pay attention what?
[76:17.34]Bill Murray pay attention.
[76:19.86]How?
[76:23.82]Preparing the virus.
[76:26.36]Somebody said, I missed Bill Murray both times.
[76:28.08]Well, I'm not going to miss him this time.
[76:29.09]You said he's on the crane?
[76:30.83]Bill Murray on the crane.
[76:43.23]I'm so ready.
[76:43.79]I'm over anticipating this.
[76:46.20]I feel like it's not going to be as funny as you said it was.
[77:04.39]Okay.
[77:05.89]Where is he?
[77:06.25]Crane.
[77:10.27]Here's the big moment.
[77:23.65]That's not even close.
[77:26.03]His face is so pixelated.
[77:27.37]That's just a guy.
[77:30.30]That's just a guy with Bill Murray hair.
[77:33.04]Actually, hold on a minute.
[77:34.30]Don't have much time.
[77:36.72]That was actually pretty close.
[77:38.12]That view.
[77:41.25]Okay, here we go.
[77:43.01]I gotta be ready.
[77:45.73]Kruger.
[77:54.91]Bill Murray's not in the credits.
[78:09.14]Drums, then Hoover?
[78:10.80]Oh, God.
[78:12.32]Drums, then Hoover?
[78:14.74]Kruger is bulletproof.
[78:17.69]Oh.
[78:18.03]Kruger.
[78:18.63]Hoover.
[78:19.29]Drums.
[78:19.91]Drums, then Hoover.
[78:24.55]Wait, what the fuck?
[78:32.07]Oh, okay.
[78:32.49]Right.
[78:32.65]No, no, no.
[78:33.43]Now we do Hoover here.
[78:34.41]Okay.
[78:37.64]It's true.
[78:38.16]It's been proven that he's bulletproof.
[78:39.92]Remember I tried to shoot him earlier?
[78:47.60]Now it's go for him.
[78:53.70]I forgot there was a second choice here.
[78:55.54]Looks like she's got herself a new boyfriend.
[78:58.79]He did Hoover last time?
[78:59.65]No, I tried to shoot him from down here.
[79:04.05]I grabbed his gun and I tried to aim up at him and he shot her in the head.
[79:11.99]Well, you've just been infected with Dr. Kruger's newest strength.
[79:18.31]Looking for this?
[79:20.17]That's what you want?
[79:20.87]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[79:24.71]It's still a little bit in there.
[79:27.70]I would just pick that thing up and just start going.
[79:32.28]I would start inhaling, right?
[79:34.84]Because you get like the vapors and it might help a little.
[79:37.18]Every cell in your body is going to mutate.
[79:40.04]You're going to be another one of Dr. Kruger's mindless zombies.
[79:50.39]Yeah, or like just touch a little bit of the wetness and get it like in your mucus membranes.
[79:55.97]Just put your fingers in your nose all the way back and try to get it in there.
[79:58.57]Get it absorbed in your mucus membranes.
[80:02.25]Okay, do that.
[80:16.46]I really don't want to have to view this whole thing again.
[80:19.56]So this better be right.
[80:23.49]Take it away.
[80:28.25]Did Hoover last time?
[80:30.15]No, I didn't.
[80:30.73]I tried to shoot up at Kruger.
[80:32.51]I was like, I'm going to shoot him from here.
[80:33.87]And I aimed down sights and he killed Laura.
[80:37.48]It's Hoover.
[80:38.04]I'm going to pick Hoover.
[80:41.14]Within three minutes, Los Angeles will be mine.
[80:45.56]Perhaps you might enjoy sharing it with me.
[80:58.03]Okay, here we go.
[81:01.15]There's only two options, right?
[81:02.95]Get him.
[81:03.85]Get him!
[81:05.33]Go!
[81:15.08]Oh no, I'm the stormtrooper.
[81:16.70]Oh no, I'm not.
[81:17.49]Oh my god, I just lit him up.
[81:21.07]Wait.
[81:22.09]What did I kill?
[81:26.37]I hit that guy?
[81:27.83]I wasn't even aiming in that direction.
[81:30.09]That shit ricocheted off the wall and hit that guy.
[81:33.36]I wasn't even aiming over there.
[81:43.87]What a god gamer.
[81:44.89]Nice.
[81:46.31]Good shot, Lara.
[81:50.79]Wait, wait till I leave.
[81:55.73]Get him!
[81:57.53]Get him!
[82:01.15]Oh, we're definitely going to dump the guy in the ass, right?
[82:02.83]We're going to dump the guy in the ass because he's going to turn into a skeleton.
[82:12.59]I cannot hit me.
[82:23.31]Don't let it dump.
[82:24.24]Come on.
[82:24.66]Get up there.
[82:30.12]Oh.
[82:43.98]Uh-oh.
[82:46.26]No, don't let him... Don't, please.
[82:51.81]What?
[82:56.11]Grab it.
[82:56.57]Grab it?
[82:57.23]Fight.
[82:57.53]Grab it.
[82:58.53]Grab it.
[82:59.25]Fight.
[83:02.15]How am I going to grab it from here?
[83:03.49]Wait, this is stupid.
[83:05.85]This is stupid.
[83:06.55]I can't reach that.
[83:07.77]Wait, what?
[83:08.67]Why did I do that?
[83:11.19]No.
[83:11.61]Ashes to ashes.
[83:17.31]What the fuck?
[83:20.93]They kept zooming into the thing.
[83:22.81]They kept zooming into it.
[83:24.79]No, this is horseshit.
[83:25.71]You know why this is bullshit?
[83:27.11]Because think of the other times where I've picked a decision where it was like, oh, go get that guy.
[83:31.63]And I just appeared tackling him.
[83:34.48]That's happened like three times.
[83:35.66]Guys, there's been choices where he just had a gun in his pocket and he didn't have it there before.
[83:43.96]The game was showing me its hand.
[83:49.16]Do you remember when I picked go to Hoover and he fucking just was in mid-tackle after hiding behind a bush or whatever the fuck was over there?
[83:58.08]God damn it.
[84:07.49]The game gaslit you.
[84:09.13]Oh, god damn it.
[84:17.98]Please tell me that... No.
[84:28.29]Okay, so to me, fight would have been stupid.
[84:33.01]But... Oh, grab the plot device of the entire game.
[84:39.68]But how am I going to fight a guy when I'm hanging from a ledge like that?
[84:43.14]You don't.
[84:44.80]plot device plot device plot device plot device I've clicked the plot device
[85:03.80]Put something up to distract us.
[85:04.92]I have a really big apology here for you.
[85:09.15]If I click out of the window, the game pauses and cannot play.
[85:14.25]So we have to work again.
[85:17.13]This is going to be a bitch.
[85:18.85]I can turn it down.
[85:20.58]Alright, I turned it down.
[85:22.20]What are we going to talk about for like two minutes?
[85:24.22]I told you to stay someplace safe.
[85:31.22]What are we talking about?
[85:33.98]Yeah, you'll see Bill Murray again.
[85:35.17]That's cool.
[85:36.51]That's pretty cool stuff.
[85:42.51]What'd I have for breakfast?
[85:44.83]Uh, I had... A coffee.
[85:48.53]And then I had... Nothing else.
[85:56.92]I don't eat... It's hard to eat breakfast.
[86:01.02]When I get up in the morning and going all the way into the early afternoon, I can't eat anything.
[86:08.82]The thought of eating breakfast a lot of times make me kind of like nauseous.
[86:14.80]I'm just not ready for food the first three or four hours when I get up.
[86:20.34]But coffee I can do.
[86:25.77]I usually eat lunch.
[86:27.23]Lunch, some kind of snack, some kind of small mid, late kind of afternoon meal, and then I do dinner.
[86:41.24]Breakfast is overrated anyways.
[86:42.38]I mean, breakfast is incredibly important.
[86:45.36]Your body needs fuel to burn so you can function.
[86:51.40]It's important to do something.
[86:55.05]You have any heal?
[86:55.57]I actually don't have any heals left.
[87:00.91]Smoothies are good, yeah.
[87:02.07]That's a good idea.
[87:07.33]You're being played by Big Breakfast.
[87:17.49]Okay, let me remember this.
[87:19.61]Drum, hoover, fight.
[87:22.45]Drum, hoover, fight.
[87:24.01]Drum, hoover, fight.
[87:32.53]Drum, hoover, fight.
[87:38.21]The essential breakfast thing is legit just Kellogg's propaganda.
[87:41.80]Well, I mean...
[87:47.15]If you... If you eat just like sugary cereals.
[88:02.42]Alright, here we go.
[88:03.20]A lot of cereals are just cotton candy with vitamin powder sprinkled all over it.
[88:16.09]Pretty much the same thing.
[88:26.51]Krueger.
[88:27.17]Hoover.
[88:27.79]Drums.
[88:28.33]Drums.
[88:30.17]Don't shoot the drum!
[88:31.05]Call them off or you're dead!
[88:33.69]I feel like that would be a great Skrillex intro.
[88:36.69]You know what I mean?
[88:40.71]Don't shoot the drum!
[88:42.77]Call them off or you're dead!
[88:44.16]They didn't hurt you, did they?
[89:01.00]Mods aren't allowed to -2 me in this channel, by the way.
[89:03.14]Demodded!
[89:14.45]See?
[89:14.87]Plot device, plot device, plot device, plot device.
[89:17.21]Plot device.
[89:17.83]Here it is.
[89:19.98]Why would I not have clicked the plot device?
[89:21.64]They've just been... Whatever.
[89:23.50]Whatever.
[89:26.85]Alright.
[89:27.05]I'm ready.
[89:57.85]Royalty-free movie night?
[89:59.71]Well, this is, um... This is pretty much not royalty-free, but it's a game.
[90:10.79]Drum, hoover, fight.
[90:11.75]Alright, let's go for it.
[90:24.87]Somebody said watch Bill Murray.
[90:26.21]Does the Bill Murray character here get a... Does he make it?
[90:30.80]I hope so.
[90:32.00]Take it away!
[90:36.90]Okay.
[90:49.64]Within three minutes, Los Angeles will be mine.
[90:54.06]Perhaps you might enjoy sharing it with me.
[91:08.17]Somebody said scuffed?
[91:10.31]Hold on.
[91:12.13]Scuffed Biden versus scuffed Bush.
[91:14.77]What the fuck?
[91:28.25]Alright, here we go.
[91:29.35]Now, there's no other choices to make.
[91:31.02]Why wouldn't you just shoot him now?
[91:42.38]I just realized they just did the Roger Rabbit routine.
[91:46.96]Same exact scenario.
[91:49.64]The vat of the acid, the juice.
[91:52.62]Dip.
[91:53.87]the weasel kind of falls over laughing hits the thing and it moves what came off first Roger rabbit was what 80 no this is definitely Roger this is 25 years old alright here we go don't screw this up
[92:23.53]Christopher Lloyd as the judge is one of my favorite acting, my favorite characters ever.
[92:30.33]He's just so good in that role.
[92:31.84]It was unbelievably good.
[92:32.82]If you have not seen Who Framed Roger Rabbit, it's required reading for this stream.
[92:51.27]Okay, fight.
[92:52.09]This is it.
[92:53.53]This is where we actually get this correct.
[92:55.41]Fight.
[92:55.65]There's not a third option, right?
[92:57.17]Let me just double check.
[92:57.89]Grab it.
[93:00.19]Fight.
[93:01.30]That's it.
[93:03.08]Let's go.
[93:18.93]Oh, okay.
[93:19.53]I just have to last long enough.
[93:22.73]There it is.
[93:23.09]Oh God, please.
[93:23.91]What do I do?
[93:28.54]There's the green screen movie night thing where I'm like strangling you.
[93:36.72]Do I take that?
[93:37.96]I think I have to take that.
[93:45.67]What do I do?
[93:46.29]What do I do?
[93:48.94]Get it.
[93:50.14]Fight.
[93:50.50]Get it.
[93:51.02]No!
[93:51.34]I don't know.
[93:51.70]What should I do?
[93:52.14]What should I do?
[93:52.68]What? What? What? What?
[93:56.26]I didn't make a decision?
[93:57.06]Oh, shit!
[93:58.10]No!
[94:01.16]I'm fine!
[94:03.88]I'm okay!
[94:06.86]I pressed space!
[94:08.58]I pressed space!
[94:11.46]I swear to God, I pressed space!
[94:13.22]Good work, my boys.
[94:14.50]Yeah.
[94:17.50]Very good work.
[94:20.02]Thank you, Herr Kruger.
[94:31.65]I pressed it.
[94:34.93]I swear to God, I pressed it.
[94:36.40]I pressed space on get it.
[94:38.48]You could hear it.
[94:39.64]You could actually hear it.
[94:45.91]Oh my god, damn it!
[94:47.89]This is gonna be a checkpoint.
[94:59.58]Is my mouse on the screen?
[95:01.00]Or is my mouse off the screen?
[95:03.38]Does that matter?
[95:04.36]Hold on.
[95:06.09]Professional gamer?
[95:06.95]I'm not a professional gamer, by the way.
[95:09.11]What are we talking about?
[95:14.04]I barely can tie my shoes correctly.
[95:15.56]When did I tell you I was a pro gamer?
[95:16.84]Alright, please give me a checkpoint.
[95:22.51]Please.
[95:24.05]Oh, fuck.
[95:26.61]Alright, keep... Okay.
[95:31.47]It's...
[95:37.00]Drum, hoover, fight?
[95:40.55]Fight or fight get?
[95:41.77]Should it be fight, fight?
[95:45.33]Fight, fight.
[95:52.92]This is your job, so you have to be a professional.
[95:54.66]How do you be a professional at a full motion video game?
[96:07.61]Fight, fight?
[96:13.87]You have to get it or you're going to get... Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[96:17.51]So there's a huge bait here.
[96:19.67]The first bait is... This is going to be a bitch.
[96:23.61]Hold on, I'm going to turn this down because I can't hear anything.
[96:26.06]Alright, so it's definitely get.
[96:29.06]The second time around it's get for sure.
[96:30.40]It has to be.
[96:31.42]Because I'm going to turn into the zombie person.
[96:36.02]Yeah, I think so.
[96:39.40]Drum, hoover, fight, get.
[96:44.32]Drum, hoover, fight, get.
[96:45.50]Can I get that written down, please?
[96:48.49]Drum, hoover, fight, Bill Murray.
[96:57.25]Drum, hoover, fight, get.
[96:59.37]There's probably something else after that, too.
[97:01.75]We're going to do this shit a whole other time.
[97:10.99]Goodbye, Hoover.
[97:12.29]Goodbye, Kruger.
[97:14.65]If you want to go to a furry convention with a fursuit, how are you not a furry?
[97:22.50]What, just because I'm going to wear one?
[97:31.04]Drum, hoover, drum, hoover, fight, get.
[97:36.00]Fight?
[97:36.24]If there's another option to fight, I'm going to do that.
[97:39.30]I think so.
[97:46.74]Yeah.
[97:50.66]After getting and taking it, if fight's an option, then I'm going to have my wits are going to be back about me.
[97:57.74]So I'll be able to fight.
[98:03.39]Can you do the annoying orange sound?
[98:05.29]I'm ignoring?
[98:15.55]What am I ignoring?
[98:16.33]Are you a furry?
[98:20.32]Answer the question.
[98:21.02]No, I'm not.
[98:21.48]There you go.
[98:24.64]That's matter of fact for you, isn't it?
[98:27.22]Should be matter of fact for you.
[98:32.42]Somebody said, this is just Goldeneye except everything sucks.
[98:43.73]Don't you love it though?
[98:46.09]I'm so glad that we get to see this and experience this.
[99:01.21]Harvester meets James Bond.
[99:02.67]Harvester was fucked.
[99:05.91]I would not play that game a second time.
[99:15.43]Alright, let's start the process here.
[99:17.25]Get the audio back to where it should be.
[99:20.49]Alright, let's go.
[99:29.83]I didn't realize the run, he screams run at the people.
[99:35.01]Drum.
[99:36.03]Hoover.
[99:36.61]Hoover.
[99:37.27]Drum.
[99:38.71]Drum.
[99:39.66]Don't shoot the drum!
[99:41.86]Call them off or you're dead!
[99:47.02]Hoover.
[99:48.22]Fight.
[99:49.40]Get.
[99:55.83]Hello Jack.
[99:57.57]They didn't hurt you, did they?
[100:02.02]So it's Hoover.
[100:04.56]And if there's something afterwards, again, I have to remind myself a thousand times.
[100:07.82]It's fight if there's another choice.
[100:09.56]Because therefore I would have taken the antidote.
[100:12.28]Marijuana is a memory loss drug?
[100:15.90]I'm not high.
[100:33.00]That would have been a huge mistake for this stream.
[100:34.94]Are you serious?
[100:36.38]Okay, let's go.
[100:38.16]Don't get it wrong.
[100:39.62]Every cell in your body is going to mutate.
[100:46.52]You're going to be another one of Dr. Kruger's mindless zombies.
[101:07.61]What if get it is wrong?
[101:09.49]Then that's not my fault because we all have come to a consensus here that I need to get it when it's on the ground because otherwise I turn into the zombie.
[101:20.28]Can we get a poll?
[101:21.28]Can we get a short poll as to what I should do after I fight the first time?
[101:37.61]Get a pull.
[101:38.49]Because if I'm going to be wrong, I need a bunch of people to be wrong too, so we can all be wrong together, so I don't feel as bad.
[101:51.08]Fight or get on the second attempt.
[101:53.62]The one that we just died at.
[101:54.60]Here we go.
[101:59.14]Within three minutes, Los Angeles will be mine.
[102:03.56]Perhaps you might enjoy sharing it.
[102:13.02]Do a prediction.
[102:13.82]It's going to take too long.
[102:16.32]Okay, Hoover.
[102:19.03]Alright.
[102:38.70]That was a perfect opportunity for a Wilhelm.
[102:41.70]Wilhelm.
[102:44.46]Okay.
[102:49.84]Fight.
[102:50.41]What do we got?
[102:52.45]What do you think?
[102:54.69]80% get?
[102:55.03]Okay.
[102:58.59]So if I'm wrong, you're wrong too.
[103:18.80]This guy shoots so many bullets.
[103:22.88]That guy probably could have thrown a rock and hit me easier than his shooting.
[103:42.35]Okay.
[103:42.97]Fight.
[103:43.59]Fight.
[103:45.10]Get.
[103:56.64]I swear to god if it's not yet, I'm gonna be so mad.
[104:00.64]Fight.
[104:02.40]Here we go.
[104:22.94]I am so nervous right now.
[104:24.89]I'm like, my heart's kind of pumping.
[104:27.87]Because I'm scared that this is wrong and we have to watch this again.
[104:31.77]Please.
[104:54.35]get it fight get it get it fight get it no yes alright now I fight I don't know what to do now I'm gonna fight if it's fight
[105:27.53]What did he grab onto?
[105:28.25]Wait, it's gonna go in the water!
[105:38.86]Was it a baby?
[105:40.76]That was a baby!
[105:48.88]Why was there a baby scream?
[106:01.47]I did it.
[106:03.49]Did you hear that like?
[106:09.92]For courage above and beyond the Call of Duty.
[106:13.08]We commend your excellence, Jack.
[106:16.74]You may well have saved us all.
[106:19.56]Congratulations, Jack.
[106:22.00]Congratulations.
[106:29.69]Wait, why does Laura not get a medal?
[106:32.62]Sometimes it's all worth it.
[106:37.56]What?
[106:37.74]Why is Lara not getting a medal for that?
[106:42.81]Her kill count at the end there was like fucking 30 people.
[106:50.49]I can't do that without her.
[106:56.09]Oh, well.
[106:58.63]That's cool.
[107:07.64]We need an alternate ending.
[107:09.02]Alright, I am willing to play through one and not play through.
[107:12.70]There's some stuff early that I really want to see.
[107:15.02]There's a lot of other shit that we need to know where it goes.
[107:24.15]Okay, play.
[107:32.63]Uh...
[107:35.72]How do I start from the beginning?
[107:43.76]Oh, shit.
[107:44.46]I can do this.
[107:45.51]Checkpoint locked.
[107:47.23]Oh, there's so many locked checkpoints?
[107:49.01]Alright.
[107:53.35]I'm not doing party.
[107:54.37]Party with torturing 14,000 people.
[107:59.64]This is some of the most fun I've had in a while.
[108:01.32]What are you talking about?
[108:03.82]I love this.
[108:04.66]I'm loving this.
[108:06.38]Alright, let's go to... I'm not doing party.
[108:12.35]Party is gonna... Lose all previous progress.
[108:17.33]Does that mean I can not start at the other ones?
[108:30.23]I'm gonna do party, but I'm gonna censor the screen to make sure it's okay.
[108:49.48]My home away from home.
[108:57.49]Crystal's looking good today.
[108:58.33]I'm sure they did actually censor this re-release.
[108:59.95]The original game did have nudity.
[109:03.85]Interesting, okay.
[109:05.95]Well, we're about to find out.
[109:07.01]Pinhead.
[109:07.19]The voiceover lines were not in the original?
[109:09.13]No, no way.
[109:18.44]The actor actually came back to rerecord them.
[109:23.79]I'm surprised they didn't port this to something else.
[109:27.93]There's trouble.
[109:29.01]This whole thing was done.
[109:30.25]Even if it was not on the Jaguar, why would they not release it on SEGA Saturn or something?
[109:35.25]SEGA CD.
[109:36.25]It's Colonel Hoover.
[109:37.33]BFD.
[109:38.79]The old man has a problem.
[109:40.15]He needs your help.
[109:42.25]I'm not interested.
[109:43.89]I'm through.
[109:45.12]It involves Laura.
[109:47.32]And a dangerous mind control virus.
[109:54.32]Shit.
[109:54.96]We think she's been kidnapped.
[109:56.26]Can't say more.
[109:57.04]It's had an adult only rating.
[110:00.19]If you're interested, meet me somewhere a little more private.
[110:04.55]Nudity in any piece of media is going to have that.
[110:08.63]Especially in a game like ESRB.
[110:10.99]A rock in a hard place.
[110:13.96]Like real people on camera, like naked.
[110:18.02]I think that would get... Bad news.
[110:22.04]Party, let's see.
[110:24.00]Oh, it's just this thing again.
[110:25.34]It's just going... Okay, we've already seen this.
[110:32.13]We've already seen this.
[110:37.17]Nice dress.
[110:39.05]Lose it.
[110:41.01]We've already seen this.
[110:46.28]She's not drinking vegetable oil.
[110:48.34]That's weird.
[110:49.25]It does look like the bottle, though.
[110:59.09]Come to papa.
[111:00.29]Alright, I don't...
[111:02.67]I'm really kind of playing with fire here.
[111:05.43]I'm not, I can't, I can't show this.
[111:08.42]I can't show this like a fourth time.
[111:10.76]You know what I mean?
[111:13.02]I'm not, I can't show this a fourth time.
[111:15.44]Which TOS allows this?
[111:18.92]I mean...
[111:31.52]So you're just watching it alone, huh?
[111:35.24]Yeah, you can't... I didn't mean to press more, but I'm curious.
[111:42.00]I'll watch it.
[111:43.74]Okay.
[111:46.95]Okay, you guys can see this.
[111:51.09]Maybe you can.
[111:59.85]Bye-bye, Jack.
[112:15.06]Ashes to ashes.
[112:16.92]Dust to dust.
[112:17.98]Okay.
[112:18.68]So we know what that does.
[112:19.88]I want to go back to the car chase.
[112:21.06]I feel like there was something else to see there.
[112:32.31]It was a whole other place to go.
[112:33.35]A whole other area.
[112:42.24]Stop seeing that as, like, sunflower oil.
[112:44.80]Lose it.
[112:51.38]I feel like drinking vegetable oil is something... That's in some, like, weird, like, dystopian game setting or something where that's what people are drinking instead of water.
[113:02.97]Come to papa.
[113:07.83]You can't do this.
[113:08.27]You're not old enough.
[113:12.80]That's basically oat milk.
[113:14.94]What do you mean oat milk?
[113:18.40]Is that vegetable oil?
[113:21.93]I'm old enough.
[113:23.33]I'm 37.
[113:39.01]This is an 18-plus stream.
[113:41.01]Yeah, it is.
[113:43.08]But... I don't know.
[113:44.64]I gotta be careful.
[113:45.64]Alright, we're good.
[113:55.18]What was the purpose for your 72-hour ban?
[113:57.53]Well, if I got banned for 72 hours, I stream once a week.
[114:02.55]That would just be like...
[114:09.76]I don't want to get banned.
[114:11.26]I don't want to get, like, suspended.
[114:12.97]Oh, the reason why we're giving you a warning or a suspension, you showed the girl on top of you a potential sex scene, like, eight times.
[114:22.57]Once, twice, three times.
[114:24.03]Okay, that's pushing it.
[114:25.01]But you showed it, like, twelve times, Jerma.
[114:27.71]Get out.
[114:28.61]Take it.
[114:29.71]Get out.
[114:30.61]Take it.
[114:31.33]Alright, so I take this.
[114:32.31]Okay.
[114:40.39]So now there's another area that I did not see.
[114:48.71]Shortcut.
[114:49.71]Laura's.
[114:50.43]Okay.
[114:50.71]Shortcut.
[114:51.59]Laura's.
[114:51.93]Laura's already.
[114:52.72]Shortcut.
[114:53.20]Laura's.
[114:53.46]There's a whole other building.
[114:59.58]Limo.
[115:00.48]Cut through.
[115:01.58]Limo.
[115:01.86]Okay, cut through.
[115:02.54]Cut through.
[115:03.04]It's this fucking goddamn truck again.
[115:06.60]Hell of a day and it's only two.
[115:17.72]Holy shit.
[115:22.54]Why is he louder than you?
[115:25.37]Yeah, his voiceover is louder than me on my microphone.
[115:32.23]He's the screamer, not me.
[115:33.81]Alright, I'm going to try this.
[115:36.55]Run.
[115:37.21]Then I'm going to do the jump.
[115:41.65]I'm going to see what happens.
[115:53.72]There's a huge mattress.
[116:04.65]Oh.
[116:06.47]These that the henchman.
[116:12.57]Jack.
[116:14.08]Fake him.
[116:15.00]Take him.
[116:16.04]Fake him.
[116:16.48]Fake him?
[116:17.02]Take him.
[116:17.48]Take him.
[116:20.86]Come on.
[116:21.84]You want a piece of me?
[116:23.52]Come on.
[116:25.27]Come on.
[116:26.91]Come on.
[116:28.03]Come on, man.
[116:28.79]You want a piece of me?
[116:30.33]Come on, I'll fight you.
[116:31.43]I'll fight you.
[116:48.72]We don't even know who those people are!
[116:50.56]I want the backstory on those two.
[116:54.60]I want to know what was that for?
[116:56.46]There has to be an explanation of who these people are.
[117:03.31]That guy says my first name.
[117:21.64]Jack fake him take him fake him take him alright fake no no he's uh hey Jack that's him yeah that's definitely him what well go on that's him idiots oh my god
[117:49.12]I just got that guy killed.
[117:50.32]That guy's just on a jog.
[117:51.56]What's wrong with me?
[117:57.58]Downtown.
[117:58.66]Shortcut.
[117:59.24]Okay.
[117:59.56]Downtown.
[118:00.69]Shortcut.
[118:06.53]Limbo.
[118:07.41]Cut through.
[118:08.03]No, not limbo again.
[118:09.25]Cut through.
[118:09.65]Alright, we might be at the end.
[118:16.97]They're still on me.
[118:24.06]Cab, here it is.
[118:25.20]Alright, just get in the car.
[118:38.47]Go to limo, then to KVK.
[118:48.09]I think, do I have a choice here?
[118:53.29]Uh, where am I?
[119:00.59]Oh, take a shower?
[119:01.31]Okay, I'm gonna go quick.
[119:03.57]I'm gonna do game.
[119:10.80]Take a shower at the house.
[119:16.14]Who is this guy?
[119:17.89]What?
[119:20.51]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[119:29.33]It's that same guy from the hallway.
[119:34.73]Alright.
[119:38.95]We'll do the next one.
[119:42.07]We've already seen all this going forward.
[119:46.01]Is there anything else I could have picked here?
[119:58.82]I'm sure there's a few little things that we didn't get to see, but that was an absolutely hysterical experience.
[120:05.92]My head hurts.
[120:06.62]The next one that we're going to play is... Let me see what it's called.
[120:14.28]The next one is called... Deathstalker?
[120:20.81]Yeah, The Specter Files Deathstalker is the next one.
[120:29.17]Yeah, we're just going to kill it here.
[120:35.48]I'm going to go pee.
[120:38.06]I'll be right back.
[120:38.58]When I come back, we'll be in another one.
[120:42.41]See you in a minute.
[120:43.17]Turn that off because that's going to be really annoying.
[120:50.41]Be right back.
[124:45.61]I have returned.
[124:47.15]Hello.
[124:50.61]Get this open.
[124:53.95]I really don't know very much about this one.
[124:55.35]It's the Specter Files Deathstalker.
[125:10.79]Are you zooted?
[125:11.39]No.
[125:17.21]play Elden Ring no I don't want to play the first 10 to 20 hours of a game and then just not be able to play it for like four months I would get so hyped up and so into it get a third of the way through the game and then just now what February I don't want to do that
[125:46.38]That's all I would be thinking about for the next three or four months.
[125:56.90]This game has death in it.
[126:01.38]Uh... I mean, it's called Deathstalker.
[126:07.87]I would assume so.
[126:11.21]It's kind of in the title.
[126:15.50]Alright, here we go.
[126:17.26]Let me just make sure it's not too loud, which it might be.
[126:19.18]I don't think so.
[126:26.78]This one looks a little more... Let's find out.
[126:35.80]Play... Okay.
[126:38.20]A, B, and C. Okay, I have to use the... Oh, you can't see anything.
[126:42.52]Hold on.
[126:51.00]Uh, can you not see it?
[126:57.43]I could be able to see it now.
[126:58.71]There we go.
[127:04.27]Interactive filament.
[127:05.23]Oh my god, that's terrifying.
[127:08.18]Ugh.
[127:08.30]Oh my god, that was horrifying.
[127:19.78]I'm actually kind of scared.
[127:21.62]Alright, make a choice.
[127:24.74]Use the left mouse button to select your choice.
[127:28.44]Pressing the space bar skips videos.
[127:30.99]Okay, in case we get stuck somewhere.
[127:32.41]And escape quits the game.
[127:34.15]So don't press escape.
[127:35.03]Alright, play.
[127:36.53]Play.
[127:37.41]Is it a music video?
[127:38.53]Did I play the music video?
[128:01.75]I just quit the game.
[128:03.61]I don't like this.
[128:05.07]That was scary.
[128:06.49]I don't like this.
[128:07.19]It's just very unsettling.
[128:11.69]I don't like it.
[128:13.25]Alright, let's play the game.
[128:25.01]Coward, coward, coward.
[128:28.57]I didn't like that.
[128:29.88]I don't want to post it, but there's probably spoilers in there.
[128:37.10]Change the Twitch category?
[128:38.20]Oh, shit, you're right.
[128:39.90]I'm going to change this to... Is this even on the categories on Twitch?
[128:51.47]There we go.
[128:56.16]Deathstalker?
[129:00.48]It is.
[129:00.76]Inspector Files, Deathstalker.
[129:06.24]Okay.
[129:08.56]Oh, there we go.
[129:09.04]Alright, I'm ready.
[129:09.58]Ready to play?
[129:12.98]It's time.
[129:13.36]We have two health?
[129:15.34]I think it's going to be really loud.
[129:16.50]I'm really sorry if it is.
[129:17.41]It is very loud.
[129:19.75]Okay.
[129:23.35]Do we have to make choices?
[129:29.35]You learn two things in detective school.
[129:32.51]First, always keep your files neat and orderly.
[129:36.17]And second, a case that involves a missing blonde will inevitably drive you to drink.
[129:43.46]Still, something about this case intrigued me.
[129:47.08]Besides, I was between clients at the time, and certain bill collectors were starting to get ugly.
[129:53.86]The papers said she was last seen in Der Hatchet Hollow,
[129:58.20]walking her chihuahua through a nearby graveyard.
[130:01.71]Not much to go on, but I had to start somewhere.
[130:04.79]Okay.
[130:05.19]There's a gentleman out here to see you.
[130:08.25]It looks like he wants money.
[130:09.55]Do you want me to show him in, or do you want to go out the window again?
[130:13.79]Uh, I'd like to go out the window.
[130:18.70]Do you hide your wallet, shout, I'm not here, or shout, I'm not here?
[130:27.52]Take a hike, sweetheart.
[130:28.46]He wanted money, alright.
[130:29.60]Inspector, Mr. Vasolini wants to give you five good reasons why you should pay him the money tonight.
[130:36.50]I didn't even give you a chance to pay the money.
[130:39.49]Am I dead?
[130:44.09]Losing consciousness is not healthy and should be avoided.
[130:47.03]I was touched by my secretary's concern.
[130:49.39]Ed, are you alright?
[130:52.07]Poor kid was crazy about me.
[130:55.36]Don't you think you ought to start looking for that girl?
[130:58.34]I mean, I'd like to get paid this week too, you know.
[131:05.33]Do you say, sure thing.
[131:07.03]Start earning the reward money, just... drive to the institute?
[131:13.64]Jesus Christ!
[131:19.67]The Der Hatchet Institute was founded by a Nobel Prize winning scientist who disappeared in the late 50s, leaving the place deserted for nearly 30 years.
[131:30.30]I walked up the creaking front steps and turned the knob.
[131:36.67]Locked.
[131:37.83]Okay, the door's locked.
[131:40.43]Knock on the door, look under the mat.
[131:41.55]There's going to be a key under the mat.
[131:43.25]There has to be.
[131:44.88]It's Scooby-Doo music?
[131:45.80]Of course it is.
[131:46.90]Okay.
[131:47.08]Do you carefully climb the stairs?
[131:48.20]Look over the shoulder.
[131:48.78]Look over the shoulder.
[131:53.04]There's going to be a monster right here.
[132:14.95]I whirled about in time to see the wind slam the door shut.
[132:19.99]Then I realized I wasn't alone.
[132:22.91]Oh shit, it's this lady.
[132:26.09]Okay, uh... Race up the stairs, ignore her, make polite conversation.
[132:32.18]Run, just race up the stairs.
[132:36.90]I bid a fond farewell to the fanged femme fatale and ran up the stairs.
[132:42.70]Oh, I hate this.
[132:44.56]I hate this.
[132:50.85]Okay.
[132:52.25]Run into the darkness.
[132:53.19]Give her a breath mint.
[132:57.25]What does that mean?
[132:57.91]Her eyes peer directly into your soul and you black out.
[133:16.14]I don't know how long I was out, but someone or something had dragged me to a cellar below Der Hatchet Manor.
[133:23.42]Okay, I lost a health.
[133:25.52]As I struggled to clear my head, I clicked on my flashlight and looked around.
[133:31.63]Any fool could see that the place had more than its share of dingbats, and I was no exception.
[133:38.07]This music keeps playing.
[133:41.90]Okay.
[133:43.78]Explore, go looking for trouble, find the friend who dragged you here.
[133:47.42]I'm going to explore the cellar.
[133:51.85]It was there in the cellar that I discovered the little man with the evil grin.
[134:03.77]I couldn't hear him over the music.
[134:05.27]He insists that you stay.
[134:06.77]Oh, give up!
[134:07.57]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[134:13.24]What is he asking me?
[134:19.85]Lance passed him saying, don't turn around.
[134:22.09]Grab his coal shovel.
[134:24.06]Grab the shovel.
[134:24.56]I think I died.
[134:39.14]I'm dead.
[134:40.80]I woke up with the feeling that I was at the end of my rope.
[134:45.14]Wait, am I dead?
[134:46.26]I was fit to be tied.
[134:50.21]The situation was bad and my life hung in the balance.
[134:53.51]What the fuck?
[134:54.19]How do I?
[134:54.53]This was no time for reflection.
[134:56.21]This is the guy that knocked me out?
[134:59.99]Mr. Spectre!
[135:00.77]Did you have a nice nap?
[135:05.47]I'm so glad you decided
[135:11.61]Well, the only reason why you're alive is because the master prefers a hot lunch to cold cuts.
[135:23.17]What do I do to get out of this?
[135:24.67]Take a deep breath, stand on your toes, do something clever.
[135:27.51]There's not enough time for me to think about this.
[135:28.61]I'm going to do something clever.
[135:31.66]I was trying to think of a diversion when I lost my foot.
[135:39.93]The whole world started to slip away as the rope bit into my neck.
[135:44.53]What do I do?
[135:45.17]Wait, I didn't have to do anything.
[135:50.65]When I got up, I saw that the pipe had made quite an impression on Laughing Boy.
[135:54.88]Okay, make good use of the rope, take the candle, and go.
[136:03.78]Uh, take the candle?
[136:09.32]I grabbed a candle and headed out.
[136:11.08]A sudden breeze blew out my candle and I could barely make out my surroundings in the darkness.
[136:23.31]I should have taken the rope or something.
[136:24.49]Use your last match.
[136:26.15]Go look for another candle.
[136:29.07]Uh, match.
[136:32.06]Don't I have a flashlight?
[136:35.79]Since I didn't get the match lit, I never even saw what hit me.
[136:40.33]It's him again.
[136:41.13]It's the same guy.
[136:42.21]Bad misuse of your resources.
[136:47.09]You black out.
[136:47.62]Am I going to be up on the gallows again?
[136:49.52]I came to in an attic.
[136:53.56]I'm supposed to be dead.
[136:54.44]Someone or something was sitting across the attic from me.
[136:58.80]Aww.
[137:00.02]At long last, the detective decides to pay a visit to his host.
[137:06.54]Have you enjoyed our hospitality so far?
[137:09.98]What the hell?
[137:14.04]It was difficult not to listen.
[137:15.95]His voice had a strong hypnotic effect.
[137:24.07]I feel like we've met before.
[137:29.72]You don't know me, but I know you.
[137:34.56]Is he drinking booze?
[137:35.64]Each time you lapse in consciousness, I get to know you a little better.
[137:42.71]Come sit, drink with me.
[137:45.63]It's something I picked out close to your heart.
[137:50.19]That was my blood he was sucking on.
[137:53.01]Should I drink it?
[137:55.60]I think I'm going to drink it.
[137:57.24]Yeah.
[137:57.36]Yeah.
[137:58.58]Check your pockets.
[137:59.40]Lunge forward and attack.
[138:01.66]I mean, it's clearly a guy with a mask on, right?
[138:04.12]I tried to attack, but... Stop, gumshoe!
[138:08.39]Count Yorchikunsky stared into my eyes, and I knew I had failed.
[138:14.01]I blacked out.
[138:16.95]Your screams can be heard for miles.
[138:19.23]Not for long.
[138:24.77]You now haunt the halls of Dura Hatchet Institute and the case remains unsolved.
[138:30.37]Okay.
[138:31.49]In hindsight, you probably could have made better choices during your investigation.
[138:36.02]Yeah, we got gumshoed.
[138:37.06]We got the, we got gum, overconfidence was your undoing.
[138:41.30]Never count your chickens before they're hatched.
[138:44.82]I can't imagine the spooky, scary ghost person calling me gumshoe.
[138:54.89]Holy shit, okay.
[138:55.83]There's a lot of stuff.
[138:58.30]Alright, let's go.
[139:02.62]You must solve the mystery to qualify.
[139:04.20]These are the top gumshoes?
[139:07.40]Shit, alright.
[139:07.70]Let's go.
[139:11.47]This time I'm not going to screw it up.
[139:16.95]In other words, don't lunge at everything.
[139:26.29]It's a game for children.
[139:27.27]This is not a game for children.
[139:28.95]I lost health in the beginning.
[139:31.06]Oh, I can skip, right.
[139:31.86]Okay, this guy's looking for money.
[139:56.09]Let's meet him.
[139:57.03]Let's just meet this person.
[140:00.98]He wanted money, alright.
[140:02.08]Thank you, Mr. Inspector.
[140:02.60]But it was for a good cause.
[140:04.02]All proceeds go to the orphanage.
[140:05.92]Wait, this is a different person?
[140:06.74]And are, of course, tax deductible.
[140:09.06]What?
[140:10.50]I don't mean to pry, but your secretary mentioned that you might be driving out to Der Hatchet Hollow tonight.
[140:17.91]That was like five dollars.
[140:19.43]It's a very evil place.
[140:22.40]I want you to have this.
[140:24.48]Oh, wait, we're gonna get something.
[140:25.42]It may save your life.
[140:27.64]It's a vial of holy water.
[140:29.46]What?
[140:29.76]Where was this in the beginning?
[140:31.16]Twelve dollars.
[140:32.58]Tax deductible.
[140:37.42]Okay.
[140:40.91]Send in the next... Okay, go find the missing girl.
[140:44.75]I have holy water.
[140:45.73]How do I use this?
[140:52.22]The Der Hatchet Institute was founded by a Nobel Prize-winning scientist who disappeared in the late 50s, leaving the place deserted for nearly 30 years.
[141:01.20]Yeah, it's packaged up.
[141:03.40]I walked up the creaking front steps and turned the knob.
[141:07.28]Alright, so the lady's here.
[141:08.80]I have a choice to turn around.
[141:11.38]So get the key from under the mat.
[141:15.48]And then what do I do about the lady?
[141:16.92]Should I just talk to the lady?
[141:18.04]Naturally, there was a key that fit the front door under the mat.
[141:24.67]The stench was awful.
[141:26.23]It was like entering a tomb.
[141:27.66]Should I just keep running from the lady?
[141:29.80]There were rotting stairs to my right and a room to my left, and I felt a cold chill on the back of my neck.
[141:35.80]Okay.
[141:40.57]Carefully climb... Should I carefully climb the stairs?
[141:43.91]Yeah.
[141:44.37]If I sneak, I probably can... As I ascended the rotting stairs, I began to feel as if I were being followed.
[141:53.68]From the top of the stairs, I could see a woman below.
[141:56.55]Okay.
[142:02.99]I don't have a weapon.
[142:03.85]Holy water?
[142:05.69]Use the holy water.
[142:08.02]Let's go.
[142:12.90]Her skin erupted as the water splashed onto her.
[142:16.48]The stench was awful.
[142:23.48]The second floor looked dark and uninviting.
[142:25.92]Okay.
[142:26.30]Alright.
[142:29.68]That was a waste?
[142:31.18]I don't know if I could have got away.
[142:33.40]Check on her condition.
[142:34.94]Run into the nearest room.
[142:36.00]You have so much... There's not enough time.
[142:40.77]My fear faded as I fled.
[142:42.91]I felt fine till I fell.
[142:46.43]So I flipped over and found I'd been followed by a fanged femme fatale with a fried finger.
[142:52.65]It's her!
[142:53.19]Use the vial of holy water.
[142:58.58]Do I have it?
[142:59.52]Kick her teeth out.
[143:01.92]Do I still have any left?
[143:04.42]It wasn't until I cut my hand on the broken glass that I realized that the bottle of holy water wasn't shatterproof.
[143:18.60]I just... Well, here we go again.
[143:21.66]I don't know how long I was out, but someone or something had dragged me to a cellar below Der Hatchet Manor.
[143:28.87]Here's this guy.
[143:31.05]As I struggled to clear my head, I clicked on my flashlight and looked around.
[143:35.95]Which disappeared after the scene.
[143:37.29]Any fool could see that the place had more than its share of dingbats, and I was no exception.
[143:48.00]Okay.
[143:49.56]Find who dragged you in here.
[143:51.12]Go looking for trouble.
[143:52.28]Find who dragged you here.
[143:53.37]I think these are all the same thing.
[143:57.96]It was there in the cellar that I discovered the little man with the evil grin.
[144:02.62]Alright, what's the correct play here?
[144:05.71]I've informed the Count of your arrival.
[144:08.69]He insists that you stay forgiven.
[144:14.56]Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[144:19.51]Okay, stay for dinner.
[144:21.97]Alright, so now what are the choices?
[144:23.77]Don't lunge at him.
[144:25.77]Grab his shovel, glance past him.
[144:27.21]Say, don't turn around.
[144:28.19]Can I debate him?
[144:33.52]He fell for it.
[144:34.72]So I took the opportunity to bash him in the chops.
[144:39.61]I never hit a man when he's down.
[144:41.85]But I knew I should have made an exception when I felt his fingers on my throat.
[144:46.66]You can't be serious.
[144:51.32]You.
[144:52.86]Flip him over.
[144:55.58]Flip over.
[144:56.32]I have to flip.
[144:56.87]That second option is not going to do anything.
[144:59.21]Flip him.
[145:00.21]I flipped him into his coal bin and ran into the darkness.
[145:04.75]He's going to kill me.
[145:09.49]Okay, laundry?
[145:09.93]Why would I hit somebody with a shovel and be like, you know, I don't hit a person when they're down, even if they're a degenerate murdering zombie person.
[145:20.69]Find an elevator.
[145:21.53]Uh, find an elevator?
[145:27.46]I found myself ascending a steep circular stairway.
[145:33.64]When a green ghoul in a rented tuxedo made a dramatic entrance.
[145:39.74]These people just went to the Halloween store and bought everything on the rack.
[145:43.85]And then just decided to shoot stuff with it.
[145:46.57]And they made choices around it.
[145:48.45]They were just having like fun for like a weekend.
[145:53.37]Let's make some small talk.
[145:54.22]See if it works.
[145:56.88]I approached the zombie reluctantly.
[145:58.64]He took his hat off.
[145:59.60]And asked him who his tailor was.
[146:03.40]His response was to push me backwards into a rickety old freight elevator.
[146:09.62]He took his hat off like, oh, it's me.
[146:11.46]Hello.
[146:11.80]Oh.
[146:12.34]What floor?
[146:18.89]Surprise me?
[146:22.27]Um.
[146:24.09]Surprise me.
[146:26.67]Piano music.
[146:42.15]It could be anything.
[146:43.37]I have no idea.
[146:44.46]Enter the room on the left.
[146:52.14]The room was crawling with vermin, but otherwise empty.
[146:56.40]They're so cute.
[147:01.56]They're just vibing.
[147:03.54]Leave them alone.
[147:04.02]Follow the rats.
[147:08.34]Yeah.
[147:15.60]The next room I came to had nothing in it.
[147:19.10]There was an old freezer on one side and a wall full of potions on the other.
[147:25.09]Just as I started to examine them, I heard a scream.
[147:38.18]Okay.
[147:40.40]Find a place to hide.
[147:41.32]Open the freezer.
[147:47.95]I'm putting this person in the freezer.
[147:53.39]Only to find another prisoner of this horrible place.
[147:59.27]What the fuck?
[148:00.01]We have to keep this guy alive.
[148:01.63]At all costs.
[148:02.05]Um...
[148:27.69]You wouldn't have a car by any chance.
[148:29.67]You wouldn't be going near Fresno area.
[148:32.55]Uh, Fresno's really not that far.
[148:35.66]Uh, who put this tag on my foot?
[148:38.78]He was, unfortunately, an obnoxious jerk.
[148:42.40]What?
[148:43.50]He's not a jerk.
[148:47.96]It's remarkable he's still alive.
[148:49.58]What are you talking about?
[148:50.44]This guy could probably help.
[148:52.54]See what he knows about the house.
[148:53.58]What do you know about the house?
[148:55.50]You've been here probably for a while.
[148:58.76]Oh shit, the fumes.
[149:00.28]He just wouldn't let me go.
[149:02.56]Is this a monster?
[149:03.72]This might be a monster in the house.
[149:05.10]Maybe this is not a person.
[149:07.70]Should I give him five bucks?
[149:30.58]I gave him $5 and left.
[149:38.53]Okay.
[149:42.03]Leave this loony bin behind.
[149:43.57]Search for remaining rooms.
[149:44.73]Search for remaining rooms.
[149:52.11]That actually might have been a monster.
[149:53.29]As I ran into the next room, I heard the scream again.
[150:02.59]Seek the source of the scream?
[150:06.82]We have to know.
[150:07.94]We have to know.
[150:09.24]Returning to the hall, I glanced up to where the sound came from.
[150:14.66]Jesus!
[150:21.55]See?
[150:22.03]Run away, right?
[150:23.17]But, I don't know.
[150:23.77]See what he does next?
[150:25.15]Run?
[150:25.35]See what he does.
[150:29.93]The Looney Tune was thrashing about wildly, so I backed up and gave him plenty of room.
[150:35.20]He fell on his head.
[150:38.94]Uh-oh.
[150:43.82]Uh... I don't... But what if he's not hostile?
[150:49.59]I don't... He might not be hostile.
[150:51.57]The Looney was wearing a straight jacket.
[150:53.85]Oh, my God.
[150:54.17]So naturally, he ran straight for it.
[151:07.46]How?
[151:07.96]Yeah, but you never know.
[151:09.30]I woke up with the feeling that I was at the end of my rope.
[151:13.64]When I realized that I was, I was fit to be tied.
[151:16.87]Alright, so we got this right last time.
[151:19.39]The situation was bad and my life hung in the balance.
[151:21.47]We have to, like, tie this guy up or something.
[151:22.87]But this was no time for reflection.
[151:26.61]Ah.
[151:28.61]Mr. Spectre.
[151:29.17]Did you have a nice nap?
[151:33.87]I'm so glad you decided to hang around.
[151:39.99]Well, the only reason why you're alive is because the master prefers a hot lunch to cold cuts.
[151:45.93]If I didn't stream, I would probably be this guy.
[151:51.39]Like if I was in a streamer or did YouTube or something, I would have probably been that guy at some point.
[151:56.41]Something clever.
[152:00.23]I was trying to think of a diversion when I lost my footing.
[152:05.19]This was the right thing last time.
[152:07.06]The thing hits him.
[152:08.59]The whole world started to slip away as the rope bit into my neck.
[152:13.87]Okay, we need to get the rope.
[152:19.23]The monster or the actor?
[152:21.38]The actor!
[152:23.88]The actor!
[152:25.04]Not what he's doing.
[152:26.96]The actor!
[152:28.16]Oh my god.
[152:31.40]Alright, make good use of the rope.
[152:35.35]I told Laughing Boy he was bound to be out of circulation for a while, but he didn't appreciate the gag.
[152:46.61]Okay, head for the hallway, explore the- look for a sign?
[152:49.15]And head for the hallway, I guess.
[153:00.36]Artifacts?
[153:00.98]Mu- ah, that's where the piano music's coming from.
[153:04.32]Artifacts or music room?
[153:05.28]We already did the elevator.
[153:06.00]I don't want to go back in there.
[153:11.70]Artifacts?
[153:13.88]Artifacts.
[153:14.26]Okay.
[153:29.47]Gold coins, wine, cryptic runes, um, decipher the runes?
[153:37.96]Just as I picked up the papers, the candle lit itself, and a funky phantom friar floated into the room.
[153:54.63]This guy looks friendly, okay?
[153:56.23]Burn his papers?
[153:57.90]Enjoy wine and candlelight.
[154:01.32]He's snapping his fingers.
[154:02.86]What?
[154:03.11]I didn't want to kill him.
[154:04.47]He just wanted to hang out.
[154:06.17]Oops.
[154:06.41]Well, I guess I won.
[154:22.51]Half of these monsters come up to me very non-hostile.
[154:26.69]Pocket the gold and split.
[154:28.49]Pocket the gold.
[154:36.90]Music room.
[154:37.66]I want to go to the music room.
[154:46.36]Quickly leave the cellar.
[154:47.61]Search the cellar.
[154:48.39]Where's the music room?
[154:49.53]Just leave the cellar?
[154:58.44]Oh, it's this guy again.
[155:02.58]Music room.
[155:06.79]Whistle a happy tune.
[155:08.01]First floor.
[155:08.45]Say second floor?
[155:10.33]Second floor?
[155:11.69]We're already on the first floor.
[155:16.85]Pick a room at random.
[155:18.21]Find the kitchen.
[155:34.84]The room I next entered was obviously a library of some sort.
[155:38.56]Great job finding the kitchen.
[155:41.82]Oh, there it is.
[155:42.68]There was a door to my left, another dead ahead, but most of the action was taking place in the kitchen on my right, where someone was practicing a bizarre form of culinary preparation.
[156:00.79]Right.
[156:02.77]Let's go right.
[156:03.43]Let's see.
[156:05.64]Okay, grab some food and go.
[156:06.50]Can I look in the fridge?
[156:30.30]Uh-oh.
[156:32.30]It's Edna.
[156:35.92]Find the edibles.
[156:37.25]Find the edibles.
[156:39.43]Everybody on this house is on them.
[156:40.95]Might as well join.
[156:41.55]Definitely take the garlic.
[156:42.97]I'm going to shove that down the boss's throat.
[156:58.19]Okay, I'm going to leave.
[156:59.37]Sneak away quietly.
[156:59.91]I don't want to do anything else.
[157:06.85]Okay.
[157:07.01]Go over to the closed door?
[157:08.49]Okay, we're going to peek through that.
[157:10.04]I'm not going in there just yet.
[157:31.01]This room seemed to be a lavatory.
[157:34.35]There was something odd about it.
[157:36.81]And then I realized what it was.
[157:39.57]The room looked like wet dog.
[157:44.61]Suddenly I realized that someone was coming up behind me.
[157:47.86]It's a vampire.
[157:48.58]See the teeth?
[157:53.40]Jump in the tub.
[157:55.04]Think quickly.
[157:55.58]Jump in the tub.
[157:58.94]Thinking quickly, I stepped into the shower and pulled the curtain closed.
[158:05.10]A hairy paw reached in and turned on the water.
[158:08.41]I'm just going to take a quick shower.
[158:11.21]I peered around the corner and saw a she-wolf busily primping herself for a night on the town.
[158:18.47]This is such a crack game.
[158:25.09]It really is.
[158:26.05]What do I do?
[158:30.99]I don't know.
[158:32.41]I'm not clicking any of these.
[158:34.94]I don't know what to do.
[158:35.82]Am I dead?
[158:49.55]I came to an attic.
[158:52.25]Someone or something was sitting across the attic from me.
[158:56.23]Okay, I have the garlic.
[158:57.89]At long last, the detective decides to pay a visit to his host.
[159:04.43]Have you enjoyed our hospitality so far?
[159:11.53]I mean, I'll be honest.
[159:12.19]It was difficult not to listen.
[159:13.83]His voice had a strong hypnotic effect.
[159:16.41]There's only one person that's really tried to hurt me.
[159:18.43]Everyone else has kind of been just a weirdo.
[159:20.90]Hanging out, like vibing.
[159:25.04]No one's really attacked me or anything.
[159:27.14]They kind of just bump into me.
[159:27.94]You don't know me.
[159:30.80]But I know you.
[159:33.52]Each time you lapse in consciousness...
[159:36.87]I get to know you a little better.
[159:40.57]Come sit.
[159:42.21]Drink with me.
[159:43.51]It's something I picked out close to your heart.
[159:48.09]That was my blood he was sucking on.
[159:50.88]Yeah, we're going to put the garlic in his drink.
[159:55.82]Check your pockets.
[159:56.46]Find something of value.
[159:58.96]If you check pockets, right?
[160:02.96]Quickly, I checked my pockets.
[160:07.86]My pockets were empty.
[160:09.12]You what?
[160:09.75]I took the liberty of removing everything from your pockets.
[160:19.43]I learned your Jedi ways by Count Dooku.
[160:21.47]This was Count Yorchakunski.
[160:22.99]I knew I had failed when I looked into his eyes.
[160:27.05]I was powerless to resist him.
[160:31.15]Shit.
[160:35.79]Well, we failed again.
[160:40.91]I got 6,000 points.
[160:50.40]You gotta get the garlic up there and get to him without being knocked out.
[160:53.36]Shit.
[160:59.76]You round up to 6,000 here.
[161:07.37]Alright, do we try?
[161:07.87]Okay, I'm going to speedrun one.
[161:11.01]Let's just speedrun.
[161:17.97]Did it crash?
[161:22.43]It crashed again.
[161:24.71]Oh, we're good?
[161:28.97]Okay, there we go.
[161:31.02]Alright, speedrun time.
[161:31.88]I'm just going to go in places I didn't go.
[161:35.66]See what happens.
[161:38.61]Okay, uh, meet the gentleman.
[161:43.91]Should be the priest.
[161:49.23]He said that- deductible?
[161:51.22]Alright, send in the next client.
[161:53.70]I'm- have another drink.
[161:59.08]I decided to take a few moments to organize my thoughts.
[162:02.92]So I poured myself another drink and began to read.
[162:08.77]Lily has to pay today or else.
[162:12.63]Easy cat.
[162:13.21]Why am I doing this?
[162:19.56]I found these clippings in the newspaper.
[162:20.78]Not sure if they mean anything, but I thought you should see them.
[162:22.88]What is this all about?
[162:23.62]Hospital dental clinic?
[162:26.67]I passed out sometime around midnight.
[162:28.73]What do you mean passed out?
[162:33.18]As I slowly regained consciousness, I was touched by my secretary's concern.
[162:38.02]Ed, are you alright?
[162:40.72]Poor kid was crazy about me.
[162:42.55]I didn't lose HP.
[162:43.95]Don't you think you ought to start looking for that girl?
[162:47.01]I mean, I'm weak too, you know.
[162:53.84]Go find... Just gathering clues.
[162:56.14]Find your car keys.
[162:57.10]Okay.
[162:57.86]Okay.
[163:02.91]Alright, let's go.
[163:14.66]Door's locked, try something else.
[163:22.92]Naturally, there was a key to the back of my neck.
[163:27.24]I was there the whole time.
[163:28.64]Weirdly enough, it was taped there.
[163:30.98]I am not sure why.
[163:33.74]Look over your shoulder.
[163:34.70]Alright, explore the room.
[163:40.10]The room was crawling with vermin, but otherwise... I'm getting different things.
[163:52.91]Explain this...
[163:57.03]If I hadn't been so busy talking, I might have noticed that she wasn't really listening.
[164:02.48]God damn it.
[164:03.18]I shouldn't have skipped.
[164:06.40]Stop.
[164:07.28]Stop.
[164:07.56]I took a different route.
[164:08.22]That's right.
[164:08.68]Fuck.
[164:08.96]That's right.
[164:09.34]I took a different route.
[164:11.60]Damn it.
[164:14.96]I don't have the holy water.
[164:15.84]Yeah.
[164:18.02]Shit.
[164:25.12]Okay.
[164:30.17]Go looking for trouble.
[164:30.99]We didn't do that one.
[164:34.93]I went looking for trouble and found it in the form of a phantom friar.
[164:40.23]Oh, this guy again.
[164:42.61]Who didn't appreciate interruption.
[164:46.37]No sense of humor, I guess.
[164:50.97]Well, this was fast.
[164:58.25]Never go looking for trouble.
[165:01.20]Oh, here I am with my lightsabers.
[165:04.10]I will take yours.
[165:04.74]I woke up with the feeling that I was at the end of my rope.
[165:09.20]When I realized that I was, I was fit to be tied.
[165:12.75]That was so bad.
[165:14.99]That was so phoned in.
[165:17.01]I'm pissed that I have to do this again.
[165:21.31]What did I say?
[165:22.01]I'm here with your lightsabers?
[165:23.75]I didn't even have a chance.
[165:26.16]I didn't even have a chance.
[165:29.47]I'm so glad you decided to hang around.
[165:33.37]Okay, we know what to do with this.
[165:40.25]This whole thing's a wash.
[165:41.05]Let's see if I stand on what happens.
[165:42.27]I was trying to think of a diversion when I lost my footing.
[165:46.23]I think they all did the same thing.
[165:49.58]The whole world started to slip away as the rope bit into my neck.
[166:01.26]When I got up, I saw that the pipe had made quite an impression on me.
[166:05.52]Okay.
[166:07.42]Use the rope.
[166:07.90]Do you remember this game sucks?
[166:14.64]Has that ever stopped us before?
[166:15.92]He was bound to be out of circulation for a while.
[166:19.32]He ate the gag.
[166:20.32]He ate the gag.
[166:22.60]Okay.
[166:23.20]Go.
[166:26.38]Alright.
[166:27.17]Let's try to look for a sign.
[166:34.06]I'm still very interested.
[166:35.06]I want to get to the music room.
[166:36.82]Because the elevator's up.
[166:43.49]I mean, the music room is up.
[166:45.81]Head up the stairs.
[166:46.95]Alright, this is the elevator guy.
[167:02.58]Okay.
[167:03.76]Makes polite talk.
[167:05.06]He puts me in the elevator.
[167:06.00]I don't want to go anywhere, though.
[167:07.12]I don't want to go back down.
[167:07.98]Um, but I don't... If I don't say anything, will he keep me on this floor?
[167:21.53]Go back in the elevator.
[167:33.58]down the hallway the next room I came to had nothing in it alright here's there was an old freezer on one side okay we're gonna try to get more info from the hippie
[168:01.65]Okay.
[168:03.31]Do you know any escape options?
[168:08.55]What, are you crazy?
[168:10.28]I mean, I couldn't get out of this box.
[168:11.90]How am I supposed to know how to get out of the house?
[168:14.42]No, no, man.
[168:15.38]Don't.
[168:15.88]Don't leave, man.
[168:17.06]Look, I... Just give me five bucks.
[168:22.97]What if I don't give him five bucks?
[168:26.67]What about... Do you know anything about potions?
[168:29.55]Hey man, you don't want to be messing with those chemicals, man.
[168:33.23]They're bad for your karma.
[168:37.68]I read the labels.
[168:39.02]Extra strength potion.
[168:40.84]Instant steak pill.
[168:42.88]Anti-grav tablets.
[168:45.14]Instant steak.
[168:49.61]Instant strength?
[168:51.55]Steak or strength?
[168:52.43]Steak or strength?
[168:52.99]Steak.
[168:56.32]I wasn't hungry now, but an instant steak might come in handy later.
[169:03.98]Yeah, we have to put this into his wine.
[169:07.76]Right?
[169:07.94]Because it goes in you and it's a steak.
[169:12.97]What about the stench?
[169:13.75]Why does it smell?
[169:17.13]Because then the steak will blow up in his body, right?
[169:20.27]But, like, there's something in here that smells almost worse than I do.
[169:26.26]It sticks to your ribs, yeah.
[169:28.28]That means that it's gonna turn into a stake inside your body.
[169:34.14]You could bathe more off.
[169:35.34]Alright, I gotta leave.
[169:36.22]We're gonna both die from this poison.
[169:39.26]I gave him five dollars and left.
[169:44.84]If the vampire eats this, somehow, I don't know how we get it to happen to eat it.
[169:52.36]Alright, we gotta leave.
[169:53.20]We're gonna leave, leave, leave.
[169:56.85]He takes it.
[169:57.49]Yeah, but he takes your stuff if you die.
[169:59.02]Which I haven't died yet.
[170:01.18]If I get knocked out again, yeah.
[170:06.08]This guy, we just do avoid this.
[170:08.74]Do not go investigate this at all.
[170:13.34]Just keep moving forward.
[170:15.89]This guy knocks you out.
[170:18.35]I ran through the door and found myself near the elevator.
[170:21.51]Okay, up.
[170:23.11]I pushed the button and waited.
[170:25.43]There was a green door to my left and a stairway to my right.
[170:36.88]Wait for the elevator, but what if he comes out?
[170:40.48]What's behind the green door?
[170:44.29]I walked over and opened the green door.
[170:46.95]The last thing I remember is staring at the hole in his chest where a steak should have been.
[170:52.09]Oh, come on.
[171:01.88]Come on.
[171:02.86]I came to in an attic.
[171:05.54]Someone or something was sitting across the attic from me.
[171:09.84]Shit.
[171:11.18]At long last, the detective decides to pay a visit to his host.
[171:17.72]Have you enjoyed our hospitality so far?
[171:21.10]I wonder if there's a way I can get through this.
[171:25.21]It was difficult not to listen.
[171:27.13]His voice had a strong hypnotic effect.
[171:29.93]Maybe it's too small.
[171:30.89]Maybe he didn't take it.
[171:36.29]Okay, uh, yeah, I don't know you.
[171:41.98]I love this costume.
[171:43.73]That was my blood he was sucking on.
[171:45.89]Okay.
[172:11.53]Should I offer him a bribe?
[172:13.87]That's the only thing I haven't picked.
[172:18.68]My pockets were empty.
[172:22.70]I took the liberty of removing everything from your pockets.
[172:30.65]I love this guy.
[172:31.93]This was Count Yorchakunsky.
[172:34.61]I knew I had failed when I looked into his eyes.
[172:37.87]I was powerless to resist him.
[172:43.84]Alright, I'm gonna try this one more time.
[172:45.88]I'm gonna try one more time.
[172:49.16]Come on.
[172:49.52]At least... Well, I opened the green door and it was... Okay, like a choose your own adventure game.
[172:58.16]There's a reason why you hold your finger on the previous page.
[173:00.91]Because open door on right, guy kills you.
[173:06.11]That's... Okay, well, fuck that.
[173:07.03]I'm not doing that one.
[173:07.77]You keep your hand, your finger on the tab.
[173:10.13]You go back and you choose the right one.
[173:19.79]You're cheating at books?
[173:21.67]That's not cheating.
[173:32.52]It's not cheating.
[173:33.38]There's still so much stuff.
[173:39.74]Okay, where do I- where have I- what am I doing wrong?
[173:45.31]There's a lot more in this game that I really thought there was.
[173:47.19]Alright, one more try.
[173:55.42]Holy water.
[173:56.99]And then we gotta leave.
[174:04.23]Okay.
[174:06.21]It was nice to see you.
[174:12.85]The... Okay, don't send in the next client.
[174:15.48]It's the guy that punches you.
[174:17.48]So, I'm gone.
[174:32.24]Under the mat, of course.
[174:39.76]Okay.
[174:44.09]Now what?
[174:46.27]Over my shoulder is the girl.
[174:47.87]Explode the room.
[174:49.73]Everything is the girl.
[174:51.85]I think the candlelit room should be okay.
[174:55.75]The room was crawling with vermin, but otherwise empty.
[174:59.55]She follows you.
[175:00.27]Oh, God damn it.
[175:01.23]She follows you both times.
[175:04.11]She follows you in both scenarios.
[175:05.61]I don't think you can avoid this.
[175:11.19]Wait, explain.
[175:13.59]I can't run?
[175:14.11]I could sense that she was attracted to me.
[175:20.39]What?
[175:20.57]Run.
[175:22.87]Run.
[175:24.92]Tell her she has nice eyes?
[175:30.01]What?
[175:30.35]I don't understand.
[175:31.53]What are you?
[175:32.93]What?
[175:34.39]Why is there no run?
[175:40.07]I can't believe there's not.
[175:41.03]Oh, god damn it.
[175:41.77]I could have avoided that.
[175:42.77]Alright, there's one.
[175:43.75]Here's how you avoid that one.
[175:46.34]You just have to go up the stairs and run.
[175:47.62]Because if you go to the candlelit room... The holy water works, but she follows you up the stairs.
[175:54.19]Alright, these all... Don't go look for trouble.
[175:56.19]These all lead to the same place anyways.
[176:17.36]It was there in the cellar that I just... Okay.
[176:22.76]So, what's the correct thing with this guy?
[176:25.83]Don't turn around.
[176:27.31]Glance past him.
[176:28.23]Should I just... Just glance past him?
[176:31.67]What if we don't attack?
[176:33.49]He fell for it.
[176:34.69]So I took the opportunity to bash him in the chops.
[176:37.49]He fell for me looking the other way?
[176:39.41]I never hit a man when he's down.
[176:41.83]But I knew I should have made an exception when I felt his fingers on my throat.
[176:50.01]Can you avoid this guy?
[176:52.09]Oh, flip over backwards.
[176:56.22]Right.
[176:58.52]Okay.
[176:58.80]Egyptology.
[176:59.18]Laundry.
[177:18.06]Look for a stairway.
[177:18.90]I don't think we did the stairway last time.
[177:21.32]Here's the guy with the hat.
[177:25.72]This guy's friendly.
[177:26.28]I wonder if there's a wrong option with this guy.
[177:46.56]Proceed.
[177:47.51]Small talk.
[177:47.85]I don't think it really matters.
[177:48.65]Let's just do small talk.
[177:52.67]I approach the zombie room.
[177:53.95]I don't want to go down.
[177:54.65]I don't want to go down to the... What if I say mind your own business?
[178:01.89]That's the one option I did not do.
[178:03.14]First floor, everybody out.
[178:08.06]Watch the door.
[178:08.84]We arrived on the first floor and I got off.
[178:11.56]I could hear faint piano music coming from somewhere.
[178:16.55]Alright, where's the steak?
[178:17.91]Kitchen.
[178:21.14]I don't remember where the kitchen is.
[178:24.70]Is it straight?
[178:28.02]I'm getting so turned around.
[178:29.74]I don't even know where any of these options really go.
[178:31.68]Okay, here we go.
[178:32.49]We want the steak one.
[178:45.47]We gotta give this guy money.
[178:46.57]Okay.
[179:00.48]Uh, what about those potion bottles?
[179:04.74]Hey, man.
[179:05.60]You don't want to be messing with those chemicals, man.
[179:08.44]They're bad for your karma.
[179:12.85]I read the labels.
[179:14.21]Extra strength potion, instant steak pill, anti-grav tablets.
[179:19.90]Anti-gravity... I feel like the steak is the correct option.
[179:25.50]Steak.
[179:29.51]I wasn't hungry now, but an instant steak might come in handy later.
[179:35.99]It'll stick to your ribs.
[179:39.31]I gotta get up the stairs.
[179:40.45]Okay.
[179:40.59]Okay.
[179:42.69]Wait, should I take the anti-gravity one too?
[179:48.49]Anti-grav tablets.
[179:51.38]I notice something strange from the moment I open the jar.
[180:02.50]Get some strength.
[180:04.88]Stop, get the, alright, take the instant strength potion and run.
[180:07.37]Taking the extra strength potion seemed like a good idea.
[180:10.05]I gotta get out of here.
[180:11.63]Till I read the fine print.
[180:14.35]Oh god, damn it, we're dead.
[180:16.83]We're dead.
[180:20.65]Ask, take a deep breath, no.
[180:23.03]Run, run, run.
[180:24.27]How do I get out?
[180:25.11]Run!
[180:26.23]leave the fumes in the room and consequently I oh come on so I blacked out
[180:42.83]Well, how was I going to know that there was two joke options?
[180:45.67]I woke up with the feeling that I was at the end of my rope.
[180:48.65]The anti-gravity pills.
[180:49.53]Oh, whoops.
[180:49.99]They fly up.
[180:50.43]When I realized that I was, I was fit to be touched.
[180:53.30]I didn't... None of this matters.
[181:06.78]I was trying to think of a diversion when I lost my footing.
[181:12.44]And then how do I get up to the attic?
[181:14.48]Okay.
[181:14.79]Let's get him.
[181:15.71]Make good use of the rope.
[181:17.17]First it was a quick save.
[181:18.53]Okay.
[181:18.67]So now from here...
[181:41.66]Look for a sign?
[181:42.82]Oh, I don't think we clicked this yet.
[181:44.84]I'm pretty sure this is one I have not done.
[181:46.34]Look for a sign.
[181:50.00]I did?
[181:55.68]Okay, music room.
[181:58.52]I need, like, a piece of paper that has, like, the blueprint of this house.
[182:02.14]It's just, like, teleporting around.
[182:04.64]It's like my brain cannot remember where I am.
[182:08.92]Oh, let's go do this.
[182:12.37]The next room contained an old writing desk under the Der Hatchet family crest.
[182:17.31]On the desk were many items of interest.
[182:25.52]Decipher the cryptic rune.
[182:29.58]And then that makes him come over, and then we put it in the thing and we burn him.
[182:32.72]Just as I picked up the papers, the candle lit itself, and a funky phantom friar floated into the room.
[182:48.28]Okay.
[182:50.18]Enjoy wine and candlelight.
[182:51.66]Okay, so from here we're still down.
[182:56.08]I have the coins.
[182:56.82]I need to find my way up to the second floor.
[183:16.26]Find the elevator.
[183:17.28]Look for a way out.
[183:18.20]Okay.
[183:19.88]Pocket the golden split.
[183:20.82]We did this last time.
[183:23.67]Which takes us outside.
[183:24.73]We can go to the elevator.
[183:37.79]Okay.
[183:39.03]Get in the elevator.
[183:46.43]I want to go to the second floor.
[183:58.51]Second floor.
[184:02.89]But then from here, where do I go from here?
[184:04.89]Anyone remember?
[184:05.37]Anyone remember where to go from here?
[184:11.35]To get to the guy?
[184:12.91]The kitchen?
[184:14.15]Alright, yeah, the kitchen.
[184:18.66]I already beat the last score.
[184:25.11]I don't remember what timeline we're in.
[184:27.91]Yeah.
[184:28.25]Alright, here we go.
[184:33.31]We're gonna go into the kitchen, get the points.
[184:49.79]Towards the right.
[184:50.33]That was good eats.
[184:53.15]Holy shit, it actually was good eats.
[184:54.91]Wow.
[184:55.19]Okay, look in the fridge.
[184:56.43]No way.
[185:18.02]Are you kidding me?
[185:18.80]This game came out, like, how long ago?
[185:22.02]10, 20 years ago?
[185:28.15]Inside the cupboard was a rose, a clove of garlic, and a couple of potatoes.
[185:33.99]So let me get this right.
[185:35.53]My memory is fucking dog shit.
[185:37.66]After this, where do I want to go after this?
[185:39.08]I don't want to do the, um... I don't want to deal with the wolf.
[185:44.50]I reached in and took the clove of garlic.
[185:48.89]Wolf is a death scenario.
[185:55.85]Okay, sneak away.
[185:57.59]Sneak away quietly, right?
[186:00.21]I need a drink.
[186:01.75]I need the rose.
[186:02.63]Alright, from here.
[186:03.75]From here.
[186:04.03]Where the fuck do I go from here?
[186:05.60]I'm not going in there.
[186:06.22]Okay, peek through.
[186:06.74]Go over.
[186:06.96]Follow the breeze.
[186:20.14]All the breeze.
[186:21.10]I don't want to go in the bathroom.
[186:26.02]Oh, fuck!
[186:26.80]I thought that was the closed door.
[186:30.54]I gotta get out of here right now.
[186:31.54]I don't know what to do.
[186:33.82]What do I do?
[186:34.94]What do I do?
[186:35.44]What do I do?
[186:47.06]Turn around, think quickly?
[186:48.50]What the fuck am I supposed to do?
[186:50.97]Think quickly.
[186:53.91]Thinking quickly, I stepped into the shower and pulled the curtain closed.
[187:00.09]A hairy paw reached in and turned on the water.
[187:04.90]What should I do?
[187:05.72]I peered around the corner and saw a she-wolf busily primping herself for a night on the town.
[187:16.64]Okay, I'm going to try.
[187:17.64]Do you want me to show the flirt?
[187:28.16]She turned and giggled like a schoolgirl.
[187:38.36]Then she started towards me.
[187:40.28]Are you kidding me?
[187:43.20]Those eyes.
[187:46.02]Am I alive?
[187:47.10]What do I do?
[187:49.86]Um, um, um, um, pucker up, pucker up, pucker up, pucker up, pucker up, pucker up.
[187:53.54]Oh, she's coming up here.
[187:54.02]I don't know.
[187:55.52]She leaned forward and planted a wet, sloppy kiss on my lips, then stepped aside to let me pass.
[188:04.33]Got it.
[188:05.43]Okay, now what?
[188:07.21]Smile and leave.
[188:08.09]Enter the room across the hall.
[188:09.03]Say, smile and leave the room.
[188:11.07]Alright, bye-bye, smile.
[188:12.33]I don't want to have to be followed.
[188:14.51]I stopped for a moment near the doorway.
[188:16.49]Okay, we've not gone this far.
[188:18.85]And now from here... I rounded the corner and very nearly bumped into a female vampire.
[188:27.88]She was starting to leave when I gave myself away.
[188:31.56]Shit.
[188:31.84]Okay, well, I have garlic.
[188:36.03]Confront her.
[188:36.71]Hide it.
[188:37.35]Um, confront her.
[188:38.17]I have garlic.
[188:38.75]I have garlic.
[188:39.19]I'm gonna do it.
[188:40.17]I have garlic.
[188:40.67]I'm gonna do it.
[188:41.05]I have garlic.
[188:41.83]I'm gonna do it.
[188:43.98]I could see she was in no mood for a confrontation.
[188:48.06]I have garlic in my pocket.
[188:49.84]What?
[188:50.80]I have the steaks.
[188:51.80]I have the garlic.
[188:52.46]Why can't I attack?
[188:56.95]I came to in an attic.
[188:59.65]Someone or something was sitting across the attic from me.
[189:03.41]I have garlic and I have the steak pill.
[189:05.35]At long last, the detective decides to pay a visit to his host.
[189:11.53]Have you enjoyed our
[189:15.50]It's fine.
[189:17.20]At least we seduced the werewolf.
[189:19.39]It was difficult not to listen.
[189:21.25]His voice had a strong hypnotic effect.
[189:27.39]God damn it.
[189:29.21]Well, let's just get as many.
[189:30.33]I'm trying to get to 8,000 points.
[189:32.19]You don't know me.
[189:34.35]I love this guy.
[189:35.37]But I know you.
[189:38.11]In my inventory was all the shit that vampires are weak against.
[189:44.95]Holy water.
[189:46.33]Steaks.
[189:47.23]Garlic.
[189:48.47]I couldn't use any of them.
[189:49.31]Something I picked out close to your heart.
[189:52.63]That was my blood he was sucking on.
[189:55.19]I'm not gonna beat it.
[189:56.05]You have to... This is... Guys, this game came out like in 1984.
[189:58.01]1985 or something.
[190:03.32]Find something of value.
[190:04.68]I don't have anything.
[190:05.86]Quickly, I checked my pockets.
[190:07.64]What's that in your hand?
[190:09.06]What?
[190:09.66]Give it to me.
[190:10.72]What is it?
[190:11.62]Ha ha ha ha.
[190:13.12]What?
[190:13.58]Ha ha ha ha.
[190:17.03]What's going on?
[190:17.51]What's in my pocket?
[190:19.19]Throw a gold coin?
[190:21.51]Kick in the groin!
[190:23.89]What should I do?
[190:24.59]Should I... I tried to attack, but... Stop, gumshoe!
[190:30.12]Count your chikunski staring into my eyes, and I knew I had failed.
[190:35.74]I blacked out.
[190:37.58]Why would you pick the gold coins out?
[190:41.14]Why wouldn't you take- Why wouldn't garlic be an option?
[190:44.94]Why wouldn't the steak pill?
[190:46.58]Oh, holy water.
[190:47.86]He didn't take the shit out of my pockets this time.
[190:50.68]I have a coin?
[190:51.56]What, am I gonna throw a coin at him?
[190:56.68]Why didn't you give him a coin?
[190:57.66]Because I want to try to kick the guy in the groin, alright?
[191:02.23]This game came out in like 1992.
[191:03.23]Are you serious?
[191:03.77]You don't think there would have been like a comedy routine where he goes like, oh my, oh my balls.
[191:12.73]I was going for like the stupid like 90s comedy routine.
[191:17.46]This game came out in 2016.
[191:25.76]It wasn't yet, but it wasn't filmed in 2016.
[191:28.24]It was filmed in probably like 1990.
[191:35.70]shit alright well that was fun the game was made in 84. yeah come on well now let's watch them now we can see the music video
[192:07.01]Wait, they're showing him dying.
[192:17.28]What the hell was that?
[192:21.18]We didn't see any of this stuff.
[192:25.44]We didn't get any of these options.
[192:31.28]Is this behind the scenes?
[192:44.25]I think the skeleton guy's mouth is partially made from a baseball mitt.
[192:58.34]There's like a wizard.
[192:59.86]Ugh.
[193:03.98]Do I cantaloupe?
[193:10.98]No, not really.
[193:18.51]I can't believe there's a wizard that can cast fireball at you.
[193:23.41]Okay.
[193:37.65]We should play it again.
[193:48.78]Oh, you need to probably have the ace for that.
[193:51.48]The thing with these old games though is you have to be so weirdly specific about everything to see some of this stuff.
[194:05.32]some random lady we saw that plenty of times
[194:33.29]Wait, was that the real ending villain?
[194:35.51]That was fun.
[194:44.29]I'm actually in love with this game.
[194:48.57]Play more.
[194:49.45]Play again.
[194:50.57]Use a walkthrough?
[194:54.21]I could just use a walkthrough.
[194:56.67]You look at the restoration of a 16mm film adaptation of the original interactive text adventure designed... Wait, this is an... This is a text adventure.
[195:04.23]That's why it feels like this.
[195:05.43]Huh.
[195:12.65]Remember the chance to create a feature-length interactive film?
[195:14.61]I want to read that.
[195:17.89]Vampires Wanted Restoration.
[195:21.01]That's really cool.
[195:23.61]I did not... Back-to-back games that just never released...
[195:27.28]It's really interesting.
[195:30.10]I love this shit.
[195:31.26]I really do.
[195:31.74]This kind of old-fashioned way to have the sort of old 16mm FMV games with all the weird goofy choices.
[195:44.33]I love this shit.
[195:51.07]People still make them now.
[195:53.55]But...
[195:55.81]People make interactive movies right now, right?
[195:58.72]There's been a few of them.
[196:02.58]One more playthrough?
[196:03.28]Alright, one more time.
[196:04.84]I'm going to get a walkthrough.
[196:05.80]I'm going to go pee though.
[196:11.35]I'll be right back.
[196:41.96]do
[198:03.31]Thank you.
[199:24.39]Thank you.
[200:20.28]Boys and girls.
[200:20.94]A little bit of an issue here.
[200:27.30]We have a little bit of a small problem here.
[200:31.01]I don't think a walkthrough exists for this game.
[200:34.95]I don't see any.
[200:37.23]There are no walkthroughs.
[200:38.33]So that's bad.
[200:43.79]Make the walkthrough.
[200:44.67]No.
[200:51.63]Did you even go to the bathroom?
[200:52.49]I did.
[200:57.99]I was promised to Overwatch.
[201:00.67]I think you're in the wrong place.
[201:03.95]Nobody's beaten this.
[201:05.75]We'll help you.
[201:08.59]You gotta be quick, though.
[201:12.97]You gotta be really quick.
[201:13.93]It's like two seconds.
[201:15.33]It takes three seconds for the stream delay to kick in for you guys to see what happened.
[201:18.74]We're not gonna be able to do it.
[201:21.64]I can't elongate that.
[201:31.21]Slow your CPU down.
[201:37.37]What if you alt tab?
[201:38.55]Actually, let me test that.
[201:39.27]Let me just see if this works.
[201:45.70]If I like tab out, will the game stop?
[201:51.62]No.
[201:52.78]It just keeps going.
[201:55.70]Yeah, it keeps going.
[201:58.13]Wait a minute.
[201:59.69]Wait a minute.
[202:01.01]Wait a minute.
[202:02.25]What?
[202:03.65]If I had known this shit, this would have been so much better.
[202:07.09]Guys, oh my god damn it.
[202:10.01]Take a look at this.
[202:11.97]Get a good view.
[202:14.22]Get a good view.
[202:16.97]The timer doesn't do anything when it gets to zero.
[202:22.22]It's just points.
[202:28.83]I was panicking half the time because I thought, are you kidding me?
[202:36.20]It's just puts your score up higher.
[202:44.44]Well, you can help.
[202:46.70]Let's figure this out together, and this needs to be unanimous.
[202:51.26]So, the obvious play here is... I can't believe this.
[202:55.92]I could have... Ugh, whatever.
[202:58.22]We're going to meet the gentleman.
[203:02.44]It's the priest.
[203:03.58]Thank you, Mr. Spector.
[203:04.94]Thank you, Mr. Spector.
[203:06.64]Spector, whatever your name is.
[203:09.68]Not deductible?
[203:12.90]Not deductible?
[203:14.84]Okay.
[203:16.86]So this just means a lot of points, mid points, not, I don't care if I get zero points.
[203:22.41]I just want to see the end of the game.
[203:23.47]Okay.
[203:27.25]We need to do click maps.
[203:28.17]Click maps is going to take way too long.
[203:35.22]Alright.
[203:35.56]The obvious thing here is I have the holy water.
[203:40.87]I don't want to send in... Do click maps.
[203:42.61]I don't even have it, like, installed.
[203:47.71]We can do quick polls.
[203:50.27]How long does a poll take?
[203:54.99]Just give us two seconds to click a whole... Alright, well then give me a second.
[203:57.79]I gotta, like, enable it again.
[204:01.36]Oh, this is gonna... I might not be able to do it.
[204:03.96]No click map.
[204:05.06]The shortest poll is one minute.
[204:09.74]That's much easier.
[204:10.44]Okay, to enable click maps, have you guys click and me disable it is like 45 seconds.
[204:16.28]Yeah.
[204:17.58]A, B, or C. Let's go.
[204:26.79]The very obvious one, I know how to get here.
[204:28.99]It's B. I know how to get us into the room, into the door.
[204:39.01]The Der Hatchet Institute was founded by a Nobel Prize winning scientist.
[204:43.41]Okay, we know about this.
[204:46.49]Okay, locked.
[204:49.40]Okay, fine.
[204:50.26]We have not done, we've only done look under the mat.
[204:53.94]What do you guys want to do?
[204:58.60]Yeah, let's open it up.
[205:00.16]Why not?
[205:02.71]We'll do a full chat's choice run.
[205:04.81]How does that sound?
[205:12.90]And I can look at this as it's coming in.
[205:16.44]And yeah, it's not going to take 60 seconds.
[205:19.68]Look, it's 66% of the vote wants me to go A. So I could theoretically just once it becomes like a 50 to 60% majority, I'm just going to go.
[205:29.85]Can you just close the poll?
[205:31.51]Like if you cancel the poll right now, just close it.
[205:33.49]Like I know that 67% have voted for A. And there's no way B is coming back.
[205:39.31]I can just do it, right?
[205:40.67]Yeah, let's go.
[205:42.67]That works.
[205:48.28]Find another way inside.
[205:49.14]Isn't that where the guy is?
[205:55.76]Okay.
[205:56.02]I think that's where the guy is.
[205:58.30]Well, there we go.
[205:58.82]Perfect.
[206:13.91]So after the poll is over, it gives enough time after a majority is seen to just keep going.
[206:19.55]That's perfect timing.
[206:22.37]Okay, we can either climb the ladder to look around, explore the extensive grounds, or move the ladder to access the open window.
[206:28.94]I'm just going to tell you, I am under the impression here that I think that's the Count Dooku guy.
[206:35.46]The Grievous guy is up there.
[206:41.14]This is extraordinarily unanimous.
[206:44.10]Looks like we're going to see.
[206:53.17]I moved the ladder and started... I hope it's him.
[206:57.53]I was halfway through the window looking at the ground below when I was struck from above by what felt like a Louisville slugger.
[207:04.11]Is it a gorilla?
[207:06.01]There, hovering above me, was a bat from the big leagues.
[207:15.59]Push its face in, swing for the fences, or maintain a safe distance.
[207:22.83]I doubt any of these work.
[207:25.24]If I'm going to be honest with you.
[207:29.98]A bat from the big leagues.
[207:37.25]Well, B makes sense because B is part of the pun.
[207:39.39]Right?
[207:40.15]Right?
[207:42.63]Swing for the fences.
[207:44.07]Big bat from the big leagues.
[207:54.50]Alright.
[207:55.00]We're going B. It's unanimous.
[207:57.66]Swing for the fences.
[207:58.24]That definitely hurt the actor.
[208:13.37]Okay.
[208:17.53]Snare the bat with the rope, climb up to the rafters, or use the rope to escape.
[208:30.96]Snare the bat with the rope.
[208:34.10]That's 80% of the vote so far.
[208:40.28]Yeah.
[208:40.70]Okay.
[208:41.26]Snare the bat.
[208:46.90]I grabbed the rope and a trap door opened.
[208:49.10]You guys were wrong.
[208:50.05]I fell for what seemed to be a long, long time.
[208:53.37]They hit the ground hard.
[208:55.35]Fortunately, I broke my fall on something soft.
[208:58.95]Well, what do you think you're doing?
[209:01.77]Mother doesn't like anybody playing in her laundry.
[209:04.11]Do you, Mom?
[209:09.72]That's right.
[209:10.42]Stay out of my laundry.
[209:11.54]Why did he change his voice halfway through?
[209:21.06]This guy is a psycho.
[209:26.19]Why does it sound like Bobcat Goldthwait?
[209:32.25]I mean, I had to make sounds and make voices and stuff like that.
[209:40.04]It sounds like me.
[209:43.20]Did you guys say this to me?
[209:44.02]Alright, give the psycho a closer look.
[209:46.74]Go find the butler.
[209:47.86]Give mama a friendly smile.
[209:54.73]Well, I think this is the death one, but we have to click it because that's what you guys want to do.
[210:00.53]Give mama a friendly smile.
[210:05.00]Let's go.
[210:07.54]Uh,
[210:16.40]Get within striking distance, casually gain his confidence, or go find the butler.
[210:25.92]Hmm.
[210:35.61]I'm convinced that you made this game and this is some kind of prank stream.
[210:38.67]I wish I did.
[210:41.57]I wish I made this game.
[210:49.96]Alright, we're going B. I moved cautiously towards mama's boy.
[211:00.29]Watch it.
[211:01.63]Right.
[211:02.05]Okay.
[211:05.63]You guys got that double wrong.
[211:07.37]That's double wrong.
[211:10.30]He flattened your nose.
[211:15.27]I don't know how long I was out, but someone or something had dragged me to a cellar below Der Hatchet Manor.
[211:24.65]As I struggled to clear my head, I clicked on my flashlight and looked around.
[211:30.75]Any fool could see that the place had more than its share of dingbats, and I was no exception.
[211:37.59]FMV game?
[211:38.63]You know how badly I've... Okay, here's the problem.
[211:43.69]There's...
[211:46.94]I have to be careful for like shotgun blasting out a bunch of ideas that I think are really fun.
[211:53.33]Because I have to focus on only a few things at a time.
[211:59.19]Make no mistake about it.
[212:02.09]I would love nothing more than to put hundreds and hundreds of hours of time and any amount of money, doesn't matter how much it would cost, to make an FMV game that's like this.
[212:18.19]But holy shit, that is like a monumental undertaking.
[212:22.59]And there's no way I'm going to be able to do it.
[212:27.65]There's only so many things that can be in the tank.
[212:32.25]You can't load up too much luggage in your car to the point where your car is touching the ground because it won't drive.
[212:40.84]I can't weigh the car down with 500 cinder blocks.
[212:48.77]make that one the last bit before retirement alright explore the cellar it was there in the cellar that I discovered the little man with the evil grin I've actually talked about it before with people in the community about like things that I've wanted to do but it's just I can't I can't it's too much to think about too much to do
[213:30.61]Alright.
[213:31.05]I mean, we already know how this one plays out.
[213:32.37]I could probably just do this on my own.
[213:38.21]Yeah, it's don't turn around and then we flip him.
[213:43.35]He fell for it.
[213:44.55]So I took the opportunity to bash him in the chops.
[213:49.47]I never hit a man when he's down.
[213:51.71]But I knew I should have made an exception when I felt his fingers on my throat.
[213:56.41]God, how fucking awesome.
[213:57.94]How fun would that be?
[214:02.71]Man.
[214:05.75]Imagine making a full FMV game and we just do it with you guys play it.
[214:10.90]Like I don't even play it.
[214:15.90]You guys pick like this.
[214:19.16]God damn it.
[214:20.22]That would be fun.
[214:21.69]Yeah.
[214:23.91]Do it.
[214:24.39]I don't tell me to do these things because I will fuck up every other project.
[214:33.96]Just give me a little bit more time.
[214:35.30]I have a lot more things to talk about.
[214:38.70]Just a little bit more time.
[214:39.72]I want to do so many of these things.
[214:44.00]A little bit more time.
[214:46.04]Alright, what are we doing?
[214:46.60]Alright, well, Chad is deciding to lose another heart.
[214:52.77]So, uh, we're going to tickle him.
[214:55.83]He just tightened his grip and laughed.
[215:00.81]Well, you died.
[215:10.58]It didn't work!
[215:11.20]You lost a heart!
[215:12.00]Just make an unfinished FMV project and have somebody else need to finish it in 30 years.
[215:17.29]That's really funny.
[215:34.62]Well, it would have to be shot in 16mm.
[215:37.06]That's one of the things I'm going to make it really incredibly, incredibly clear.
[215:41.32]If I were to do this, it's being shot in 16mm.
[215:46.54]I don't care how expensive it is.
[215:52.58]This needs to be that way.
[215:58.67]It's going to be like $2 million.
[216:02.65]Fuck it.
[216:06.67]I don't think it's going to cost that much.
[216:09.66]Do 16mm and then get it restored into 4K.
[216:13.18]Wow, now that's a big brain play.
[216:15.54]That's a big brain play.
[216:20.60]Did somebody say cringe?
[216:24.19]Alright, this is easy.
[216:26.37]All these are the same.
[216:27.03]I was trying to think of a diversion when I lost my footing.
[216:35.50]The whole world started to slip away as the rope bit into my neck.
[216:40.20]Have us pay for it?
[216:41.14]Do like a pay-per-view stream?
[216:46.01]When I got up, I saw that the pipe had made quite an impression on Laughing Boy.
[216:50.21]I wouldn't want to do... Okay, here's what I wouldn't want to do.
[216:57.21]I wouldn't want to make it so people couldn't watch it.
[217:01.45]Even if that, okay, let's say that this whole project, if it was ever done, remember, this is not me saying it's happening, I'm just saying I'm interested.
[217:10.42]If it was, oh, here's an idea, we'll make the whole thing, and then the stream will be you pay for the stream.
[217:16.85]Like a pay-per-view stream.
[217:19.59]I want as many people to experience that as humanly possible, right?
[217:25.51]Maybe do paid physical copies.
[217:27.91]Yeah, honestly, I would not give a shit at all.
[217:31.77]I mean, obviously, I don't want to lose millions of dollars.
[217:35.37]That would be fucking devastating.
[217:36.71]I don't have millions of dollars.
[217:40.17]That would be pretty bad.
[217:42.69]Maybe there's a way.
[217:43.87]Maybe I'll find a way.
[217:44.49]Alright, what do you guys want to do?
[217:50.55]Yeah, of course.
[217:51.07]Losing millions is really funny, though.
[218:03.85]No.
[218:05.35]Not really.
[218:06.03]Okay, well, alright.
[218:10.84]This is where it all goes completely off the rails.
[218:24.19]What about getting it sponsored?
[218:26.67]Yeah, the... You don't... Ugh.
[218:32.96]I'm going to get the sign.
[218:33.60]It would need to be done with actors and shot on film.
[218:42.00]I want it to be old.
[218:47.64]Okay.
[218:49.14]Where are we going?
[218:56.64]Make yourself an actor?
[218:57.84]No, I don't want to be the only actor.
[218:59.42]I would be in it for like 10 seconds.
[219:04.58]I'd be like the old prospector that you run into in a hallway somewhere.
[219:16.91]This is also pretty, this is very unanimous.
[219:19.07]Look for some artifacts.
[219:22.87]The next room contained an old writing desk under the Der Hatchet family crest.
[219:27.86]On the desk were many items of interest.
[219:35.09]Did you get streamers to be actors?
[219:39.54]No, I don't think so.
[219:41.80]I don't want anyone... I feel like, okay, I want them to be unknown.
[219:45.28]I don't want anyone to know who they are.
[219:47.00]I want them to be actors.
[219:48.96]I want them to be... I'd like to be, like, real.
[219:52.70]Because here's the thing.
[219:54.92]Stuff like that would be really funny.
[219:57.18]But let's just say it was, like, streamer X.
[220:01.85]It's like streamer X playing character, right?
[220:05.85]It's not, that's a monster on the screen.
[220:10.53]So if I would ever do, exactly the same reason why I said I don't even want to be in it either.
[220:16.38]Like, I would want to be in it for like 10 seconds as like an Easter egg.
[220:19.74]I don't want to be in this.
[220:21.06]I want to hire, I want to like direct actors, right?
[220:23.48]Because then it's just, oh look, it's Jerma as this character.
[220:26.61]You know what I'm saying?
[220:27.37]You know what I'm saying?
[220:31.67]So no, it would be all just actors that we would be hiring.
[220:35.15]And I'm talking like this is happening soon, but it's not.
[220:40.19]If it did happen, it would be like that.
[220:41.69]Alright, uh, taste the wine.
[220:46.64]We already know how to do this one.
[220:50.98]We already know how to do this one.
[220:52.42]Why are you doing this?
[220:56.81]As I reached forward, the candle lit itself.
[221:00.54]And as if by magic, a monk appeared.
[221:03.20]Okay.
[221:14.88]Well, this is a different option now.
[221:20.15]Play more of these games.
[221:22.23]If you're a relatively new viewer, full motion video games, I've played almost all of them.
[221:28.34]Over the last five years or so.
[221:30.86]There actually aren't very many left that I haven't played.
[221:35.67]Some of the new ones I haven't played.
[221:37.69]The ones that have come out in the last year or two.
[221:42.87]Eh, we're going B. Dunk the flame in the wine.
[221:46.48]Oh, yeah.
[221:46.84]Okay.
[221:46.94]Okay.
[221:55.86]At least the ones that looked like we'd have a good time playing them, right?
[222:00.46]Some FMV games are very much meant to be taken very seriously.
[222:05.36]And it's not like, oh my god, look at how funny that was, or look at how bizarre of a scenario that was.
[222:09.49]It's just actors doing things in front of a camera.
[222:12.09]So it's supposed to be taken seriously and not like, oh, let's have a fun time and laugh at this.
[222:16.17]Alright, pocket the gold and split.
[222:22.27]I think that's what it's going to be.
[222:24.05]It is.
[222:36.05]Okay.
[222:36.15]You guys cannot make another mistake.
[222:43.75]Cool.
[222:52.46]Okay, you want to go... I don't want to say anything because it's kind of close.
[222:57.40]When is the baseball stream?
[222:59.18]Baseball stream is going to be at some point in the first quarter or second quarter of next year.
[223:07.52]Somewhere when baseball is played.
[223:11.87]It was a theory that we might be able to get it done this year, but it's not going to happen.
[223:16.27]Too cold.
[223:20.35]But I refuse to not do that stream.
[223:27.37]And what about Grotto Beasts?
[223:28.73]Grotto Beasts, actually, let's do this right now.
[223:30.95]I want to shout this out.
[223:33.09]So Grotto Beasts, I can't give you a time or a date for that, but I really, really want you to be able to have that stuff in your hands.
[223:44.93]The physical cards in your hands by the latest quarter one of this coming year.
[223:55.29]I'm giving a huge window for that because it's very, very possible that's way earlier.
[224:01.44]But I don't want to rush people on the work that they're doing.
[224:08.42]So if you get it at some point at the end of this year or January, maybe you do.
[224:14.91]But I'm not going to tell you that because I don't want to put a dumb amount of pressure on people to have to get stuff done.
[224:22.17]That's... I don't know.
[224:23.37]I do not want to do that.
[224:24.15]So whenever it's done, and whenever it's like, okay, it's ready to go.
[224:29.37]And with that, let's go ahead and talk about this.
[224:33.53]So... The Grotto Beasts team has a Twitter.
[224:42.73]And they post various updates.
[224:44.26]I actually just retweeted them on Halloween.
[224:48.82]Here's the official...
[224:51.14]Grotto Beasts's Twitter account.
[224:57.55]Let me put it in the chat.
[224:58.79]Go give it a follow if you want to know more about Grotto Beasts coming up.
[225:04.31]They post all the time.
[225:06.51]All the various artists.
[225:10.44]And here you go.
[225:13.18]Here is the official Twitter of the Grotto Beasts's
[225:20.58]Trading card game.
[225:25.14]I was holding off on talking about this until it was clear that we had sort of like an end goal of soon.
[225:37.53]Roto Beast NFTs.
[225:38.89]These are not NFTs.
[225:39.85]There's not going to be an NFT.
[225:43.49]There won't be any Grotto Beasts NFTs.
[225:46.02]You're going to be able to hold these in your hand.
[225:48.34]It's cards.
[225:52.68]You will be able to purchase and open for yourself packs of Grotto Beasts cards.
[226:03.89]By the way, let's make this very clear too.
[226:07.53]if you think that this was just going to be a repackaged thing that I opened on the stream you are so wrong there's going to be an astronomical more amount of cards and it's going to have a playable game behind it as well you're actually going to be able to play this with people it's a real game you have a game designer
[226:38.84]And I hope you like it when it comes out.
[226:42.62]Because there's other stuff that I haven't talked about yet with it too.
[226:47.29]But you know what?
[226:49.87]Yeah, fuck it.
[226:50.39]Let's just talk about it.
[226:51.11]Why not?
[226:52.43]Hey, I... I'm the goddamn CEO, okay?
[226:57.36]Um... Should I hold off on some stuff?
[227:04.66]So the Grotto Beasts card game...
[227:08.79]is going to end up being a pretty significant uh when people talk about like merch right oh what what should you do for merch did you do a t-shirt I could do another t-shirt oh maybe I'll do a t-shirt maybe I'll do something else or maybe I'll do like a toy or something in the Grotto Beasts card game there's going to be not just Grotto Beasts
[227:33.74]It's not just going to be Grotto Beasts.
[227:35.46]It's going to be tons and tons of this channel's references, characters.
[227:45.35]It's going to be a gigantic crossover.
[227:51.79]So it's not just simply the Grotto Beasts.
[227:55.99]There's potentially lots of other things too that you'll be able to have and collect.
[228:05.92]It's the biggest crossover event ever, and it's two things that were created in- on this same channel, in this same community.
[228:14.74]It's not even a crossover event.
[228:16.95]It's the same goddamn channel.
[228:22.21]Um... So... I've been pretty tight-lipped about this because I don't- I didn't want to, like, hype this up until I knew that it was gonna start to become a thing.
[228:33.89]So, it's a game.
[228:35.17]You can actually play it.
[228:35.89]You don't even have to.
[228:42.03]He's losing viewers.
[228:42.91]No, stay.
[228:43.31]Don't.
[228:43.77]Please don't leave.
[228:44.80]Please don't leave.
[228:45.28]Please.
[228:50.30]What about people that were in the Jerma Rumble?
[228:51.90]I don't know.
[229:07.28]Thanks for the 20 community subs, Vanto.
[229:12.80]Uh... Yes.
[229:15.58]So, there's a lot of plans for, like, that project in the future, maybe.
[229:20.71]Just know that it's gonna have a lot of cards.
[229:25.85]It's gonna be... I don't want to talk too much about it because I don't want to get anything wrong.
[229:29.44]And Community Jake right now might be fucking speed dialing me, going like, Don't stop talking!
[229:34.96]So, I gotta be careful.
[229:35.84]I don't want to talk too much.
[229:42.25]But follow that Twitter.
[229:43.95]That's where official updates will be on that Twitter.
[229:52.35]What about t-shirts?
[229:53.89]Yeah, there'll be merch.
[229:55.17]We'll have some merch.
[229:55.82]But they're going to be different rarities.
[230:03.62]Don't... Right now, Jake is fucking spam texting me.
[230:07.04]Stop talking, stop talking.
[230:15.11]What about a sunflower update?
[230:17.43]Um, sure.
[230:17.89]It's November.
[230:19.96]They're gone.
[230:20.58]Alright, let's go back to this.
[230:23.90]I don't even know what you guys picked.
[230:25.02]This is a nice get rich scheme.
[230:37.77]No.
[230:40.13]No.
[230:44.28]This is it.
[230:44.90]It's me selling you card packs.
[230:58.17]Get rich more, Scheme!
[231:05.34]Alright, settle down.
[231:06.84]Settle down.
[231:09.64]Real life- Gotcha.
[231:12.92]No, we're go- Okay.
[231:16.01]Community Jack's gonna scream at me.
[231:18.08]I'm gonna get screamed at on the phone.
[231:21.32]There's gonna... It's gonna be... Don't worry.
[231:23.26]Okay.
[231:23.72]No, I'm gonna... I'm... Okay.
[231:25.80]Let's go.
[231:27.76]There's no NFTs associated with this.
[231:29.78]What the fuck?
[231:31.06]I never said that.
[231:34.44]What about EU?
[231:34.92]EU?
[231:37.34]I don't, I have no answer for that time.
[231:40.82]I don't, I currently do not have an answer for this time.
[231:44.04]I'm, I think so.
[231:45.20]I just can't give you an answer.
[231:46.92]I don't know.
[231:47.34]I do not have an answer for this time.
[231:49.12]And my phone just blew up.
[231:51.59]I've got eight unread notifications on my phone.
[231:56.39]I see a stop sign emoji a hundred times.
[232:01.01]Okay, I probably should, let's go ahead and play the game.
[232:10.96]What did you guys pick?
[232:19.33]It was A?
[232:20.73]I don't remember.
[232:21.27]I can't.
[232:22.70]It was B?
[232:23.22]Alright.
[232:23.84]B. Let's go.
[232:27.16]On the steps above me, a green ghoul gestured gracefully.
[232:36.81]I'm really, really excited for not just the fact that the Grotto Beasts are really awesome, but it's going to be this interesting kind of mix of like a ton of references to this the last decade plus of this channel and community.
[232:55.14]It's a really interesting way I was hopeful to do merch.
[233:06.14]And we're going A. Proceed boldly.
[233:09.24]I approached the zombie reluctantly and asked him who his tailor was.
[233:18.93]His response was to push me backwards into a rickety old freight elevator.
[233:26.67]Yeah, you said boldly.
[233:37.57]You end up gonna do the Jerma Joke +2 -2 futures market with channel points?
[233:41.97]That seems like a fun idea.
[233:46.58]Yeah, I did.
[233:47.62]But that's the problem.
[233:51.46]This is why I get into trouble.
[233:54.35]I get in a lot of trouble because we pick- okay.
[233:57.09]I tell- I tell you guys about four or five different things that sound really interesting, don't they?
[234:03.78]But in reality, only one or two of those things can possibly be worked on.
[234:10.07]So, what ends up happening is you are like, oh my god, he talks about like four or five different cool things going on, when in reality, one of these things is actually going to work.
[234:21.32]These are all things that I really want to do.
[234:22.92]Every time I talk, it's things that I really want to do.
[234:26.82]But here's the thing, right?
[234:29.78]Since the Dollhouse stream...
[234:33.47]There's been some potential here to do more, possibly, maybe, hopefully.
[234:41.29]Maybe find more people that are willing to get on board and help us pay for projects and help us do things.
[234:50.25]Some of these things are possible now because the dollhouse happened and the dollhouse was a really, really fun time.
[234:59.07]So I can't tell you exactly what's going to happen because I still don't even know.
[235:03.46]But if some of these doors are starting to open a little bit more with like, okay, now people are aware that I want to do big projects and I need capital and I need people and I need more crew members and stuff, right?
[235:19.43]Like this is all stuff that's knowledgeable to a lot of people now.
[235:23.65]So if I can get some of these things to help make these projects come faster, that's what I'm going to do.
[235:36.11]Networking Andy?
[235:38.49]Well, you bet your ass that I want to try to make some of these things a reality, right?
[235:47.18]And if they do become a reality, that's what makes me happy.
[235:51.50]I don't care about anything else.
[235:52.60]I really don't.
[235:54.22]I don't give a shit about anything else.
[235:56.86]I could not make a single dollar from any of the projects.
[236:00.10]None of them.
[236:00.58]Zero.
[236:01.24]I would not give a flying fuck at all.
[236:02.86]I wouldn't care at all.
[236:03.79]I don't care.
[236:06.17]If the projects can be paid for, and I don't have to worry about it, then fucking perfect.
[236:12.87]That's exactly what I want.
[236:14.39]I don't care.
[236:14.95]He's lying, by the way.
[236:20.60]I'm not.
[236:21.14]I swear.
[236:21.84]I promise you.
[236:22.60]I don't care.
[236:27.06]You've seen... Okay.
[236:29.01]You've seen...
[236:31.21]the leak I don't even need to tell you that like we've made jokes about it before do I really need to make a shitload of money on each project because I'm I have to no I don't care number 98 yeah
[236:59.01]I'm not a liar, says the liar.
[237:00.19]Yeah, I am a liar.
[237:01.23]I'm a liar.
[237:02.13]But not on important stuff like this.
[237:07.78]I'm not trying to make a bunch of money.
[237:09.82]I'm trying to have things be paid for, right?
[237:13.96]That I care about.
[237:16.12]And sometimes people will hear about how much some of these projects cost, right?
[237:22.73]Holy shit, it was that much money?
[237:25.61]Yeah.
[237:27.93]Sometimes it has to be.
[237:31.55]But don't give, do not give me any money.
[237:33.13]I'm seeing people give money.
[237:34.05]Don't do that.
[237:34.83]Stop giving me money right now.
[237:36.31]I demand it.
[237:36.79]Somebody just gave me $100.
[237:38.75]Thank you for the, do not, do not give me any money.
[237:43.17]Stop that immediately.
[237:44.37]I command it.
[237:46.06]I demand it.
[237:47.18]I demand it.
[237:47.90]It ends at once.
[237:48.86]Where are we going?
[237:56.71]Stop reverse engineer Andy.
[237:58.72]I'm just saying.
[237:59.34]Alright.
[238:01.16]Just know, in the future, whatever projects we do, I'm just, I'm glad that they were able to happen.
[238:08.81]That's it.
[238:12.79]Just think about this.
[238:13.41]This is like the kind of shit that I've wanted to do since I was like fucking 12.
[238:16.96]Right?
[238:20.07]I cannot even begin to tell you guys just how it feels to, like, something that I wanted to do when I was 11.
[238:28.93]You are 12.
[238:29.43]Like, yeah, I am.
[238:32.45]I'm really, I'm living every single one of my fantasies from when I was a kid.
[238:37.39]It's unbelievable to me.
[238:38.53]And the fact that I'm able just to do that alone, just by itself, is worth more than anything.
[238:44.37]Anything.
[238:45.03]Anything.
[238:47.47]So the fact that I can sit here and talk like this is already enough.
[238:52.59]I just want to be clear.
[239:03.94]Jesus fucking Christ, just play the game already.
[239:11.74]I just had a major announcement.
[239:14.09]Come on.
[239:14.53]I just talked about the Grotto Beasts.
[239:15.97]That's a major announcement.
[239:18.13]I'm going.
[239:19.33]I'm going.
[239:19.69]I'm sorry.
[239:20.21]I'm sorry.
[239:20.63]I'm going.
[239:21.21]I thought it was a major announcement.
[239:22.37]I have a major announcement.
[239:25.13]Okay.
[239:27.69]And I don't want to be, oh, look at me.
[239:29.31]I'm so good.
[239:31.14]Oh, I don't care about money.
[239:32.66]I'm a good guy.
[239:33.28]I'm a good guy.
[239:34.04]No, I don't want to do that either.
[239:36.28]Alright.
[239:36.68]Okay.
[239:36.88]I'm going to go.
[239:37.36]We're going to go.
[239:37.96]I'm a fucking bad guy.
[239:38.90]Alright.
[239:39.18]I'm the bad guy.
[239:39.64]Don't worry.
[239:44.28]What'd you guys pick?
[239:56.64]Okay.
[239:57.64]Surprise me.
[240:00.13]I don't want to be like a preachy asshole either.
[240:03.78]Well, you know, I'm so much better than... Look at what I do.
[240:07.48]I don't care about... Only me.
[240:10.70]I'm the only one that cares about not receiving monetary... I'm the only one.
[240:15.10]No, I don't want you to think that either.
[240:17.82]I love money.
[240:18.50]Okay?
[240:24.12]Here we go.
[240:35.06]Alright, walk straight.
[240:35.80]I don't think I've done this before.
[240:43.51]The next room I came to had nothing in it.
[240:47.03]There was an old freezer on one side and a wall full of potions on the other.
[240:57.43]Just as I started to examine them, I heard a scream.
[241:10.05]Okay.
[241:13.10]Open the Freezers, the correct play.
[241:16.06]We've all seen it like five times already.
[241:24.48]Although, does opening the freezers stop whatever the laughing, screaming person coming in the room?
[241:35.26]I think Coolsville sucks.
[241:41.22]Alright, just open the freezer.
[241:46.35]Ignoring the fumes, I open the freezer.
[241:53.75]I love this guy.
[241:59.91]Can I just do this on my own because I know how to get there?
[242:13.90]please do okay hey man you don't want to be messing with those chemicals man they're bad for your karma I read the labels extra strength potion instant steak pill anti-grav tablets okay uh so it's the take the steak
[242:43.58]leave I wasn't hungry now but an instant steak might come in handy later where's your choice that's what everybody was gonna pick alright this is it's a and then you leave these are both this is gonna kill us so don't don't be don't be stupid about this
[243:24.09]Okay, good.
[243:24.83]Thank you.
[243:29.14]Hey man, like, I don't mean to be rude, you know?
[243:32.30]But, like, there's something in here that smells almost worse than I do.
[243:37.50]You know?
[243:38.60]He did have a point.
[243:41.12]What?
[243:49.15]That noise at the end.
[243:51.61]Uh, yeah, we gotta get out of this room.
[244:04.92]It's your one year anniversary with the sus face.
[244:08.90]I want a divorce.
[244:17.03]I gave him five dollars and left.
[244:28.30]Alright.
[244:30.80]This is a tough call because I don't remember exactly which one of these means you get grabbed.
[244:52.53]How do you feel about the rats becoming extremely popular on TikTok?
[244:56.61]Sorry, say that again.
[244:57.39]Say that one more time.
[244:59.83]I didn't hear that that well.
[245:01.03]Say that again.
[245:05.99]I want you to say that again.
[245:09.91]The rats are incredibly popular on TikTok.
[245:12.55]The rats are huge on TikTok.
[245:14.39]I'm sorry.
[245:15.03]I'm leaning over my ear.
[245:16.06]Say that one more time.
[245:18.10]What did we talk about like a few weeks ago?
[245:22.11]What?
[245:22.39]That I... I am huge on TikTok and I'm not even there.
[245:28.85]Excuse me.
[245:29.39]I'm just trying to understand why everyone was saying that that was not accurate.
[245:41.32]Rats are also huge on Facebook.
[245:45.62]Alright, let's search the room.
[245:50.44]The rats are popular, not you, bozo.
[245:56.29]As I ran into the next room, I heard the scream again.
[246:00.06]I am the rats.
[246:03.12]The rats are nothing without me.
[246:12.07]Should I make a TikTok video of doing the rats song, but make sure I'm doing it really poorly?
[246:16.82]And I'd be pretty relatively unknown on TikTok.
[246:20.54]Would people like hate me for it?
[246:21.72]Would be like, oh, that was terrible.
[246:23.32]Nice try.
[246:24.28]My video is way better on the rats meme.
[246:27.38]It's like, I'm the one who made it.
[246:30.25]You're talking to the guy that made it up.
[246:36.63]Keep moving forward?
[246:37.53]Why?
[246:39.13]You're not actually going to do this, are you?
[246:44.57]I ran through the door and found myself near the elevator.
[246:47.97]Oh, I thought you fall.
[246:49.35]I pushed the button and waited.
[246:51.65]There was a green door to my left and a stairway to my right.
[246:55.91]Okay.
[246:57.68]I know for a fact that we don't do the green door.
[247:05.42]This is a really important decision.
[247:13.72]I'm just kidding.
[247:19.80]Scramble up the stairs.
[247:27.82]Is it time to release?
[247:29.52]Release?
[247:33.20]Release?
[247:33.86]Is it time to release?
[247:37.20]The third rat song?
[247:47.93]I wonder if we're going to get to the end.
[247:51.33]At the top of the stairs, I saw an ugly dwarf.
[247:54.30]This is the master's private property.
[247:56.68]This guy's, what?
[247:57.42]This guy's huge.
[247:58.06]It's my job to see that it remains private.
[248:00.70]Private eye versus private eye gore, eh?
[248:03.12]How tall am I?
[248:14.71]Okay, show him your license, take evasive action, and put down that shovel.
[248:29.04]Take evasive action.
[248:32.76]When he moved, I jumped over the railing.
[248:36.06]It was a long way to the first floor, and Laughing Boy was no help at all.
[248:40.60]That's it.
[248:44.47]That would hurt so bad.
[248:47.61]Holy shit, that was painful looking.
[248:53.15]I think you guys are in some trouble here.
[249:00.98]Grab his shirt and pull, punch with your stronger hand, or let go of the railing.
[249:06.16]Grab his shirt and pull is winning by way too much.
[249:11.90]I grabbed his shirt and he flipped over the railing.
[249:17.23]Symbol crash?
[249:20.81]The second floor looked dark and uninviting.
[249:30.36]Okay.
[249:32.44]Where we going?
[249:36.52]I told my friend who used to work for the company that helped with this game and he thought that it was crazy that you were playing it.
[249:43.46]We're having a great time.
[249:46.92]The last one too.
[249:47.62]I applaud the companies that actually tried to restore this stuff.
[249:57.23]This is awesome.
[249:58.13]I'm having a lot of fun.
[250:01.15]Ask your friend how to beat the game.
[250:07.08]Alright, we're going, I don't know.
[250:10.90]It's 51-42, A and C. If it were me, I would probably pick the one that we didn't do yet, which is probably whatever medical records.
[250:24.42]And that's winning right now, so that's what I'm going to pick.
[250:35.52]The room I next entered was obviously a library of some sort.
[250:39.09]Well, kitchen regardless.
[250:41.73]We're gonna get the garlic?
[250:43.37]There was a door to my left, another dead ahead, but most of the action was taking place in the kitchen on my right, where someone was practicing a bizarre form of culinary preparation.
[250:54.27]Okay.
[251:00.16]But we don't necessarily have to do the kitchen, but the garlic seems pretty important.
[251:12.74]Ah, yes, the library kitchen.
[251:19.57]Yep.
[251:22.17]I couldn't put my finger on it, but there was something odd about the woman in the kitchen.
[251:29.13]It's really cold in this room.
[251:31.79]Do you see the breath coming out of it?
[251:34.10]Do you see that?
[251:37.66]Do you see just how cold it is in there?
[251:39.96]I feel bad for the actor.
[251:50.24]Oh, yeah, we're going to look in the fridge, of course.
[251:52.62]Alright, find other edibles.
[252:12.57]We've gotten this right plenty of times.
[252:15.65]Make the FMV game and make sure there's no references to you in it.
[252:18.13]No, there won't be.
[252:19.97]It would be... It would be... I mean, well, there'd be... You'd probably know I made it somehow.
[252:25.75]But this would not be a, like, Jerma985 FMV experience.
[252:31.56]It'd be like an old Western game or something.
[252:33.82]Or like an old horror game.
[252:40.00]Inside the cupboard was a rose, a clove of garlic, and a couple of potatoes.
[252:48.08]Okay.
[252:48.20]What are we doing?
[253:03.90]Don't tell us you made it and just play it one day.
[253:05.72]Well, I think it would be really fun if the first experience ever with the game was on the stream and you guys are doing this.
[253:15.87]Maybe we'll build like an extension or something.
[253:20.25]I have, like, some kind of use of an extension for you guys to do it easier.
[253:27.74]So, you guys will get the first experience of the game.
[253:29.70]And then, like... A week later or something, it goes on Steam or whatever.
[253:39.19]Stop giving him an idea.
[253:40.25]He only cares about money.
[253:55.15]I care about money.
[253:56.07]I don't only care about money.
[253:57.57]Money's somewhere on the list somewhere.
[254:02.97]Take the potato.
[254:03.93]I feel like I'm gonna get hurt.
[254:09.30]I... You guys... Really?
[254:18.71]I think A is... You took too much!
[254:20.99]Die!
[254:21.13]And we get stabbed.
[254:25.34]This is a GG, I think, yeah?
[254:36.42]Alright, well.
[254:40.35]I told you.
[254:41.35]What the hell?
[254:54.31]I came to the attic.
[254:57.01]Someone or something was sitting across the attic from me.
[255:02.65]At long last, the detective decides to pay a visit.
[255:13.30]This doesn't matter.
[255:14.14]Oh, I feel like we've met before.
[255:16.12]You don't know me.
[255:22.07]That's my favorite shot of the whole thing.
[255:25.70]When he's kind of leaned over.
[255:27.18]You all said A anyways.
[255:28.42]I want this guy.
[255:29.08]I want this guy.
[255:31.76]I want this character.
[255:32.64]Okay.
[255:33.22]This is actually important.
[256:04.76]I want that exact character in another game.
[256:10.48]Find something of value.
[256:11.74]I should have the coins.
[256:12.76]Quickly, I checked my pockets.
[256:14.56]What's that in your hands?
[256:16.56]Give it to me.
[256:18.64]Okay, throw a gold coin.
[256:27.12]That's the only option that probably results in something different that's a different video clip.
[256:41.41]That's right.
[256:44.75]I threw it in his mouth, expecting him to choke to death.
[256:48.15]What?
[256:48.59]But instead... Very tasty.
[256:54.81]When I looked in his eyes, I knew I had failed.
[256:57.81]I was powerless to resist him.
[257:01.93]That was so stupid.
[257:11.51]That sucked.
[257:13.57]That sucked.
[257:15.48]It was a great throw, but... Jesus.
[257:20.14]Okay.
[257:22.42]You guys want one more chance at this?
[257:25.86]I'm gonna give you one more chance.
[257:28.44]But let's get to the end.
[257:34.10]I know you can do it collectively.
[257:35.46]I know you can.
[257:44.68]Is there another FMV?
[257:46.19]I have one more that's ready for right now, but it's new.
[257:51.67]And I don't know.
[257:52.29]I'm not sure if I want to do it right now.
[257:53.99]It looks like it might be long.
[258:04.20]Depends on how long it is.
[258:07.22]Is it the Battle Royale one?
[258:09.05]Omega LOL, it is.
[258:10.69]Why are you saying that?
[258:21.16]Omega lul, omega lul, omega lul.
[258:24.25]No chance.
[258:24.69]What do you mean?
[258:32.63]Fortnite is not an FMV, dude.
[258:43.72]It's short?
[258:44.84]Alright, well, let's try it.
[258:48.01]This is really fun, though.
[258:48.75]I like this a lot.
[258:51.08]Remember, it's only been three hours.
[258:52.54]Um, excuse me, it's been four hours.
[258:54.72]Excuse me.
[258:55.16]Okay.
[258:58.58]We'll try it.
[259:08.50]Let's exit this.
[259:09.36]That was the Specter Files Deathstalker.
[259:12.24]That was great.
[259:12.72]I had a lot of fun.
[259:17.40]Hopefully, I gotta turn this down because it might be very loud.
[259:22.84]What's it called?
[259:23.32]Bloodshore.

[260:01.96]It's like live.
[260:03.04]It's to viewers.
[260:04.06]Squid game type shit.
[260:05.44]I don't know.
[260:10.86]Why can I not capture this?
[260:11.80]Oh, there it is.
[260:25.13]Okay.
[260:33.63]Alright, this is, uh, this looks kind of bright.
[260:38.48]Is this bright?
[260:44.50]At least the subtitles can be on.
[260:49.30]What, streamer mode?
[260:51.72]Oh, there we go.
[260:53.35]It's kind of bright, isn't it?
[260:56.45]Uh, subtitles on, medium, subtitle background, borderless window, streamer mode, you can pause choices.

[261:13.78]I've seen Squid Game.
[261:15.98]I've seen the whole show.
[261:17.30]Alright, you ready?

[261:45.86]You see, it's a game.
[261:52.32]It's a game with a handful of squids.
[261:54.18]They have a bunch of squids that get to come in and all of them have some type of money problem.
[261:58.10]I don't want to give anything away.
[262:03.93]Name one squid.
[262:15.73]I watched the show high.
[262:17.63]I was really high when I watched the whole thing.
[262:20.35]So I don't even know anybody.
[262:22.13]I don't remember any, I don't remember the plot either.
[262:33.58]The front, no, I don't want to say that because that could be a spoiler.
[262:38.51]I know who the... You heard me say some words there, and you know that was a character.
[262:46.37]You heard me say that I just said something.
[262:48.93]You heard it?
[262:50.67]I know who that character is.
[262:56.46]No, I don't want to give spoilers away.
[263:05.24]Can I just say the main character's name?
[263:08.61]Did I say the main character's name?
[263:10.57]Get off the IMDb page.
[263:25.41]I-I... The main character's name is Squidward.
[263:35.88]Quiet!
[263:37.04]The following content contains scenes that some viewers may find disturbing.
[263:38.96]It is not suitable for younger audiences.
[263:39.93]It includes graphic depictions of violence, blood, and death.
[263:42.93]Viewer discretion is- Get out of here, kids!

[264:06.41]I'm just pretending to because I want people to think I know what I'm doing.
[264:08.79]I want people to think I know pop culture and shit.
[264:11.88]I haven't seen one episode.
[264:15.14]I've seen the whole show.
[264:16.26]I can name ten characters.
[264:17.30]I just don't want to.
[264:27.21]It's showtime!
[264:28.81]Welcome to the
[264:31.43]Can we... Can a mod change this to Bloodshore?
[264:34.51]See, it is like Squid Game.
[264:36.21]I told you.
[264:47.13]Killstream, now entering its 13th season, has been criticized by human rights experts for its brutality, having claimed the lives of 210 of its 470 contestants thus far.
[264:59.40]Showrunners Alan Cork claim that all contestants are fully aware of the opportunity of volunteers.
[265:05.88]They chose to be in this arena.
[265:07.00]Volunteers, please.
[265:08.61]They're desperate, poor, brainwashed, often completely unstable.
[265:12.61]My agent says it's going to be really good for my career.
[265:14.89]I mean, publicity is good publicity, right?
[265:18.22]Hmm.
[265:40.40]Is that justice?
[265:41.68]I guess I have what it took.
[265:43.06]Death or glory.
[265:45.65]In the past few years... Who do we play as?
[265:48.19]...have risen in line with the economic downturn.
[265:50.27]What could we do?
[265:50.97]We opened it up to everyone.
[265:52.09]These people are a byproduct of the society created by you.
[265:55.53]Some would say you're a coward having tapped out.
[265:57.57]Well, they can say that to my face.
[265:58.78]You have been inundated with applications.
[266:01.38]They have been ground into dust by the boot heel of the rich and powerful who are now using them for their own entertainment.
[266:08.46]Socialist mother...
[266:10.10]If I didn't know any better, Chris, I'd say you were accusing me of exploiting the poor.
[266:13.43]I'm not the only person to find your show utterly abhorrent.
[266:17.23]Have you ever fired a gun before?
[266:18.99]Don't ask dumb questions.
[266:20.11]The terms are agreed upon by both parties.
[266:22.37]You think it's fine to witness deaths on television?
[266:25.43]Since the beginning of time, man's been pitted against his fellow man in combat.
[266:28.77]Surely we've evolved from a more barbaric time.
[266:33.26]I'm not so sure we have.
[266:39.56]Can we play as one of these people?
[266:42.72]What the fuck?
[266:44.78]They're like Instagramming this shit?

[269:38.63]I have no idea how this works, guys.
[269:40.61]I... Move your cursor?
[269:42.03]What if there's a decision?
[269:43.40]That's a... Oh.
[270:11.80]Uh-oh.
[270:14.70]You know what they say about he who hesitates.
[270:17.98]What a fucking loser.
[270:19.64]What?
[270:20.90]Oh, the audience is not on board with me right now.
[270:26.23]Alright, so it's just whatever it takes to win, right?

[271:29.26]Where's escape?
[271:31.42]Tracker?
[271:33.00]Team morale, audience opinion, romance, strength, and insight.
[271:39.73]Really?
[271:40.35]Okay.
[271:45.11]Let's go.
[271:55.29]I'm very confused.
[271:56.01]Why don't we just... How come we're not just killing each other?
[271:59.05]Like right now.
[272:02.27]Immediately.
[272:04.72]PUBG doesn't work like this.
[272:07.02]Everybody runs around and finds like a fucking frying pan and starts killing each other instantly.
[272:10.10]It'd be over in five seconds.
[272:21.58]Someone runs around until they find a gun and just starts shooting everybody.
[272:26.42]I take it back, Mikey.
[272:28.06]You did alright.
[272:30.76]One down, 49 to go.
[272:35.75]Really?
[272:36.87]We don't get disqualified for this, right?
[272:38.59]This ain't on us, yeah?
[272:39.73]Hey, can you send me that?
[272:40.85]We're disqualified.
[272:43.15]100,000 watching now.

[272:48.23]Don't worry, kid.
[272:48.77]100 million concurrent viewers.
[272:50.07]That's like 5 billion.
[272:58.95]Cut that out.
[273:02.55]There's a kid watching this.
[273:06.49]Take the camera off.
[273:08.19]Take the camera.
[273:12.56]There's a kid watching.
[273:16.98]There's like 5 billion people watching at the end of the day.
[273:20.32]100 million concurrent viewers is like billions of people watching over the course of a day.
[273:30.13]Where are we?
[273:30.83]Look sharp, people!
[273:31.91]You're on camera!

[274:53.99]Seriously, what is this?
[274:56.21]This isn't the island.
[274:57.81]It's different every time.
[274:59.55]It's usually warm, sandy beaches.
[275:04.53]Didn't we show up on a beach?
[275:06.77]You might want to be careful where you step.
[275:09.75]They're everywhere.
[275:11.83]What?
[275:12.07]Did it make light of the situation?
[275:15.65]Kaboom!
[275:17.96]They're smart minds.
[275:19.37]They use them to force players close to each other.
[275:21.75]Keeps the game interesting.
[275:23.73]Must be hundreds of thousands.
[275:26.11]That explains why they couldn't afford to send us to The Bahamas.
[275:28.59]So we have to stay close to each other?
[275:31.05]We all know what it's like.
[275:32.47]Anything to get the views.
[275:34.20]My agent's going to hear about this.
[275:35.94]Who cares?
[275:37.06]We're not here for a vacation.
[275:38.66]Someone's going to step on one of those.

[277:39.33]Well, they've introduced the comedy guy.
[277:42.55]So, he's absolutely going to last at least 20 minutes.
[277:46.80]Comedy guy might die first in a funny way, right?
[277:49.16]Because they might go the comedy guy dies first, funnily.
[277:54.44]I'm saying comedy guy.

[279:42.34]Black.
[279:44.18]Yeah, and where is he now?

[280:26.99]Found themselves in trouble, got separated from the support crew.
[280:31.23]They found Dev alive and well.
[280:34.31]Should have starved to death.

[283:30.66]Should we open it?
[283:31.74]No, don't.
[283:32.60]Why?
[283:33.04]Open it.
[283:33.32]It's probably something.
[283:34.44]I'm opening it.
[283:35.06]I want it.
[283:35.37]Whatever it is.
[283:35.81]What's everything in there?
[283:40.43]Okay.
[283:41.39]Go on.
[283:41.77]Get in there, Sean.
[283:45.03]30 minutes to show time.
[283:46.73]Time to get dolled up.
[283:49.40]Oh, the show hasn't even started yet.
[283:52.54]Where are the others?
[283:53.04]It's the starting soon screen.
[284:00.64]He's gonna go step on a mine.
[284:13.56]Dev's gone.
[284:14.98]Good.
[284:15.96]That guy was creepy AF.
[284:18.76]He's gonna step on a mine.
[284:20.15]I'm telling you.
[284:21.37]This one too.
[284:22.33]I'm telling you.
[284:22.89]What's up?
[284:25.07]Thought you'd left with Dev.
[284:29.49]He's gonna go shit on a mine.
[284:31.98]Wait, this is a camper?
[284:32.78]Hope he dies first.
[284:33.26]Oh yeah?
[284:57.46]Get to the weapons drops first, Moloch.
[284:58.78]Excuse me?
[285:00.10]You heard me.
[285:01.26]What the fuck is your problem?
[285:02.02]Do they drop weapons?
[285:03.68]Do you think this is a game?
[285:05.80]Guys.
[285:09.50]Go on, then.
[285:10.90]Leave.
[285:12.24]Get out before I use your head for fucking target practice.
[285:15.92]Fuck this.
[285:16.30]I'm not staying here with this fucking psycho.
[285:18.48]React?
[285:19.56]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[285:23.96]There's no way I'm siding with a camper.
[285:25.52]I'm just making that really clear.
[285:29.37]What?
[285:30.11]If you're not gonna be a team player, I don't see this working.
[285:32.19]Dude, come on.
[285:36.03]Fine.
[285:37.59]Totally fine.
[285:39.09]Team.
[285:39.41]I'm a load of fucking bullshit.
[285:41.11]Fuck it, Ray.
[285:42.19]Ouch.
[285:44.45]React harder.
[285:47.75]You didn't side with Jerma Otto.
[285:51.86]You cool?
[285:54.20]I'm practically Sub-Zero, though.
[285:58.02]Woo!
[285:59.58]React, dude.
[286:00.22]Hurry up.
[286:03.66]Gives a weapon drop.
[286:15.09]Nobody changes channels this fast.
[286:16.31]You have to spend at least 10 seconds to see what it is.
[286:28.21]Don't you know the double double double double double double double cross?
[286:32.91]The animal style double cross.
[286:34.69]The animal style double double double cross.
[286:37.17]I need to make sure everybody here, I'm not a threat to anybody, but I'm a threat to everyone.
[286:40.86]Oh yeah, I remember him.
[286:42.44]I didn't expect it.
[286:43.64]I know, right?
[286:44.40]I thought it was going to be the one with the iPad.
[286:46.82]The Korean.
[286:47.46]No, that was... Sunwoo.
[286:50.06]Ah, that's it.
[286:51.78]Classic.
[286:54.16]Oh wait, there's more than us?
[287:14.04]Oh shit, I was about to kill all these people.
[287:16.42]I was about to start killing all my teammates.
[287:20.08]Oops.
[287:20.26]I thought it was just us, like, six.
[287:21.54]Oops.
[287:42.88]Who do you think you're teaming up against?
[287:47.78]I thought they just... Holy shit.
[287:52.20]Imagine not paying attention to the first five minutes in the plane.
[287:55.30]I would have picked a brick up and started hitting people in the head.
[287:58.22]Last night.
[288:03.45]And in more serious news, this time around we're changing things up.
[288:09.05]This year, there will be no tap outs.
[288:12.48]Can't tap out, why not?
[288:13.82]What does that mean?
[288:15.54]What the fuck?
[288:17.32]That's right.
[288:18.78]You're all in it to win it.
[288:21.23]No rescues, no tactical dropouts.
[288:24.33]This year...
[288:28.02]This is insane.
[288:29.03]You will shortly receive your first weapons drops.
[288:31.89]Not too far from your current position.
[288:33.89]So move fast!
[288:35.19]With half the planet watching you right now, you're already a superstar.
[288:39.87]Now go!
[288:40.93]Put on a show!
[288:44.09]Bastards.
[288:45.98]They can't do that.
[288:46.82]I signed a contract.
[288:48.94]You'd be the first one to die?
[288:49.98]Ah, but did you read it?
[288:51.36]I mean, I did.
[288:52.16]It wasn't exactly binding on their part.
[288:54.36]Fuck you!
[288:56.55]I'm calling my agent.
[288:57.49]Attempt to inspire the team.
[289:00.72]Let's, alright, let's come to bring it together.
[289:02.54]No, no, guys, come on.
[289:03.66]We gotta keep it together.
[289:05.48]This is just what they want.
[289:06.92]Panic.
[289:08.96]Ah, they didn't listen.
[289:09.58]Whatever, fuck them.
[289:10.90]You're all getting bricked tomorrow night anyways.
[289:12.72]Let's go get those weapon drops.
[289:16.00]Yikes.
[289:16.62]What a loser.
[289:26.40]Oh, they hate me now.
[289:27.40]What a loser.
[289:28.97]I'm a loser?
[289:29.45]Might as well give it up, Nicky boy.
[289:31.73]Loser.
[289:35.81]Yo, don't ever underestimate the underdog.
[289:38.77]He can only surprise you.
[289:39.93]Hey, what did Tish call it?
[289:50.44]Camping?
[289:52.20]That's what we should do.
[289:53.95]We lay low and ride it out.
[289:56.05]Did the weapons crates drop?
[289:57.65]We should be right on top of it.
[290:06.40]Why are kids watching this and why are kids analysts about this?
[290:09.98]Yeah, I don't understand the... I suppose Trump lives... This guy's dead first, I'm telling you.
[290:21.47]I'm telling you, he's dead.
[290:23.77]He's dead instantly.
[290:25.09]He's gonna die.
[290:26.69]Very soon.
[290:27.56]In less than 10 minutes.
[290:46.21]How do we know how to use these?
[290:47.03]Shit.
[290:52.38]Kill her now.
[290:53.22]No, I'm not gonna... Now that I know that we're a team.
[290:58.55]Um... Wait, which one doesn't work?
[291:03.25]I don't remember.
[291:04.43]Is the one on the left... Okay, is it my left?
[291:08.21]Or is my right?
[291:08.79]The thing... I'm switching the poison on myself.
[291:15.86]I don't want to do this.
[291:16.48]Is it my gun on right, like this one?
[291:18.84]Or gun on my left?
[291:19.62]My left?
[291:26.25]It's your left.
[291:27.81]So it will be this one is left.
[291:30.67]And left is the one that does not work.
[291:33.49]So I'm going to give her this one.
[291:36.41]Okay, these are all pretty old.
[291:37.99]She'll only use them if we need to.
[291:41.37]They're screws.
[291:45.07]Jesus.
[291:49.61]That one works.
[291:51.91]That one works.
[291:53.15]Oh shit, I reversed the poison on myself.
[291:54.81]I actually did the thing from Princess Bride.
[291:57.69]I freaked out.
[291:58.59]Investigate.
[292:18.34]Don't shoot.
[292:19.58]I'm not armed.
[292:21.47]Where's your landing group?
[292:22.97]I'm on my own.
[292:24.03]I overshot the landing.
[292:25.59]I've been out here all night.
[292:26.77]Where are your bruises?
[292:27.65]Where are your scratches?
[292:28.31]Shoot him.
[292:30.41]I'm right here, bitch.
[292:31.61]Shoot him.
[292:32.61]Seriously, man.
[292:35.52]You don't want to do this.
[292:36.94]Shoot him.
[292:42.32]No scratches.
[292:43.00]I probably shouldn't have done that.
[292:46.77]Should I have done that?
[292:50.38]I just, oh, I just landed.
[292:51.72]No scratches, no bruises.
[292:53.30]Oh yeah, I just landed away from my group.
[292:55.18]Yeah, right.
[292:55.70]Look around, they're out here.
[292:59.35]They're probably hiding.
[293:01.69]He was a threat.
[293:02.77]Is that guy dead?
[293:07.39]Yup.
[293:08.09]And he had a gun.
[293:09.01]Thank you.
[293:11.17]Everybody wants to say I'm a psycho?
[293:13.11]I just saved the goddamn team.
[293:16.80]This guy's fucking dead.
[293:19.92]Big news, guys.
[293:21.76]This shit's fucking real.
[293:23.34]It's fucking real.
[293:24.28]Hesitation is defeat.
[293:24.92]I'm gonna go with the flow, you know?
[293:26.73]I'm gonna give it a go.
[293:27.41]I may even win this fucking thing.
[293:28.55]Who knows?
[293:29.51]Are you out?
[293:30.23]Cold-blooded, Nick.
[293:32.23]I love it!
[293:33.47]Doing what's gotta be done.
[293:34.83]Everyone's gonna come after you now?
[293:37.43]Down to 30 in no time at all.
[293:40.11]Now it's getting interesting.
[293:47.83]No, if everyone's... Look, that's the thing.
[293:50.45]If you landed away from your group, you're not going to hide behind a tree and approach another group.
[293:58.16]Not a chance in hell.
[294:00.64]Why would you sneak up on another group?
[294:02.48]That's not going to happen.
[294:06.08]I did what I had to do.
[294:06.98]Really?
[294:07.22]You never see it anywhere.
[294:15.40]I don't know.
[294:15.80]Straight ahead?
[294:16.58]I feel like everyone's gonna be going around.
[294:43.95]Nobody wants to do the straight shot because it's too far in the open.
[294:46.49]We don't want to be too exposed.
[294:47.59]But isn't everybody going to be going around?
[294:52.62]I think it's straight on.
[295:02.26]I say we go straight through.
[295:03.14]Let's go.
[295:03.82]See if we can catch someone off guard.
[295:06.90]No, we go the other way.
[295:08.92]Yeah, makes sense.
[295:10.85]We shouldn't take the risk.
[295:11.91]Are you serious?
[295:16.01]I didn't just get telltales, did I?
[295:21.33]Oh, wait, they don't trust me.
[295:22.77]It's actually a meter.
[295:27.85]Oh, shit.
[295:28.65]They won't listen to me.
[295:29.57]That's actually kind of interesting.
[295:36.72]It's illusion of choice, but it's not really an illusion of choice.
[295:40.87]This is a team morale meter and they would have listened to me if they didn't hate me or something.
[295:50.64]What's the difference between a liberal and a puppy?
[295:55.04]A puppy stops whining when it grows up.
[295:57.68]Landmine.
[296:02.10]Here comes the landmine.
[296:04.41]Or maybe they're going to keep him around long enough to make everybody hate him and then they'll kill him.
[296:09.49]I don't know.
[296:11.70]I'm just gonna keep walking.
[296:22.02]By the way, let's talk strategy here.
[296:27.66]Why would you ever talk like that with your teammates in a life or death scenario where you need to, like, have each other's backs?
[296:37.86]I feel like you don't want your teammates to like fucking hate your guts regardless of any of this, right?
[296:44.84]Why would you do that?
[296:48.73]Everybody is like hating this guy.
[296:50.61]And he's like, I'm being like political and I'm like a dick.
[296:54.59]Isn't that hot?
[296:55.49]Look at me.
[296:56.91]Like, why wouldn't you want to like have your back with your teammates?
[297:03.50]This is a life and death scenario with everybody here.
[297:09.14]Come on, guys.
[297:10.30]Did you not prepare for this at all?
[297:12.79]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[297:14.21]Easy now.
[297:15.11]I'm just running out.
[297:17.09]What the fuck?
[297:20.03]Did you find any?
[297:22.13]What's going on here?
[297:31.49]I saw something up ahead.
[297:32.65]Like a building.
[297:33.37]Looks like some kind of outpost thingy.
[297:34.83]What's with the blood?
[297:36.43]You getting some trouble?
[297:37.31]Don't point the gun back at your face.
[297:38.85]That was really bad.
[297:39.93]Shit, there's some fucking psychopaths out there.
[297:41.37]Woo!
[297:42.37]One less now.
[297:44.56]Um.
[297:47.30]I, I, I, what, why do you have blood all over your face?
[297:53.48]I mean, it's very, very, it's very, very, very odd that it would be that high.
[297:59.55]Like, okay, if you shot somebody, like, and they sprayed blood on, it would be like kind of here, here, here.
[298:06.55]She's blood like on her face up here.
[298:09.17]Why?
[298:09.44]That's very, that's, that's a little odd.
[298:11.62]I don't, you need to explain this here.
[298:13.54]What?
[298:14.80]You seem awfully eager to get us to this outpost.
[298:17.54]What's waiting there?
[298:19.34]You know what?
[298:19.74]Fuck you.
[298:20.26]Hey, hey!
[298:25.48]Is this the del- is this the- Are we supposed to be on the same team?
[298:29.76]Is she working with another team?
[298:52.09]That was really weird.
[298:52.85]You have blood on your mouth.
[298:54.41]Weird.
[298:54.69]I don't know about that.
[298:59.14]If it were me, if I had blood all over my mouth, it'd be like, look guys, let me explain why there's blood all over my mouth.
[299:02.98]Listen to me.
[299:10.15]You're camping right now.
[299:14.21]Anything to fucking survive, man.
[299:22.01]Nice.
[299:38.26]Oh, what?
[299:38.76]I gave... Oh, shit.
[299:41.08]That's the... That was the broken gun.
[299:49.33]That was the broken gun.
[299:51.61]Oh, no.
[299:56.08]I'm not getting up.
[299:59.56]I'm such a coward.
[300:00.80]No, I have to.
[300:01.88]No, no, no, no, no.
[300:02.98]I'll do it.
[300:04.08]I'll do it.
[300:04.46]I'll do it.
[300:04.76]I'll do it.
[300:05.04]I'll do it.
[300:05.36]Hold on.
[300:05.66]Wait, wait, wait.
[300:06.18]I'm going to get up.
[300:08.68]I'm going to get up.
[300:09.14]I'm going to get up.
[300:09.54]I'm going to get up.
[300:11.54]Is that you, wolf boy?
[300:13.86]Now we're putting on a show.
[300:16.32]Here comes a team wipe.
[300:17.82]This is easy, easy.
[300:19.54]You took the good- You took the good gun and didn't even use it.
[300:31.79]Oh.
[300:39.07]Oh man, I feel really bad.
[300:42.37]I feel awful.
[300:43.95]This is bad.
[300:44.67]I need to redeem myself right now.
[300:46.91]Where the fuck did they go?
[300:49.50]I... Stop.
[300:58.60]I don't know what... Oh, thank God.
[301:02.74]Streamer mode.
[301:03.93]Okay, guys.
[301:04.41]We got three seconds left.
[301:06.95]And I got to be honest, I'm really not so sure what I should do.
[301:11.24]I'm thinking that Gav has experience with potential survival skills, but Tish had a lot of big brain ideas.
[301:20.67]I'm not so certain about this, though.
[301:33.57]She had some I think she's she's probably it's probably to keep the smart person Tish just suspects me Oh shit she does
[302:00.65]You were acting sus.
[302:01.79]You've been acting sus towards Tish.
[302:06.41]If you save her, then she should trust you again.
[302:13.53]But Tish had a headshot.
[302:17.64]Bro.
[302:19.18]That's right.
[302:21.52]That's right.
[302:21.86]I feel like I haven't heard very much from Gav.
[302:31.94]In fact, people are saying, who is Gav?
[302:35.34]So, just because of that, I think we have to get rid of him.
[302:42.57]That's it.
[302:45.21]Bloody hell.
[302:48.49]Oh, shit.
[302:50.05]Gav is not the annoying guy.
[302:53.87]Good job I followed you down.
[302:56.28]Good work on the bridge there.
[302:58.38]You really showed him.
[303:01.90]She did get a headshot.
[303:06.17]That was the deciding factor for me.
[303:24.41]That's what put me over the edge.
[303:26.79]I forgot about her arms skills.
[303:35.84]Tish led you to the bomb trap though.
[303:44.24]My head.
[303:45.85]What just happened?
[303:50.49]Looks like the mines.
[303:51.27]They must have figured a way to reuse them.
[303:54.18]The heck?
[303:55.32]I might be impressed when my ears stop ringing.
[303:58.04]Oh shit.
[303:59.04]She's injured.
[303:59.48]You see what happened to the others?
[304:01.26]I didn't see shit.
[304:03.56]I think Scarlet went down in the shootout, though.
[304:06.36]Where are we?
[304:09.34]Oh, thank God.
[304:11.03]We're five miles inland.
[304:13.95]You should have stayed with Otto.
[304:16.53]Fuck.
[304:17.79]The thing again.
[304:19.17]What is it?
[304:20.41]He said he was a camper.
[304:28.09]You okay?
[304:29.41]Got louder?
[304:29.89]I just turned it off.
[304:30.35]It won't be this that kills me.
[304:35.27]Turn that off.
[304:37.27]Why?
[304:38.35]You are too, though.
[304:41.82]Well, if somebody wants to decide on taking me over somebody else, then you know not to take the camper.
[304:48.20]It's great to be part of a real team.
[304:50.32]I think you made the right choice.
[304:59.16]Fucking hell.
[305:02.78]Jesus Christ.
[305:12.75]Come on, man.
[305:18.00]What the fuck?
[305:19.24]Stop.
[305:19.94]What's wrong with everybody?
[305:21.18]Come on.
[305:25.52]Now you're a star.
[305:26.72]Yeah.
[305:31.82]You gotta shoot everybody over here.
[305:34.12]Shoot everybody.
[305:43.76]Is she alive?
[305:44.40]What's going on?
[305:44.80]Zombie?
[305:45.46]Zombie?
[305:59.98]What the fuck?
[306:00.50]I'm glad I got the mature stream warning on this one.
[306:01.92]Holy fucking moly.
[306:17.71]contenders left in the game, but it looks like that's the end for Nick Romeo and his team.
[306:23.17]I guess we saw where his heart was right at the end there.
[306:26.58]Eugene Kristoff, when you created the show, you put a selection of the world's deadliest death row inmates on an island to battle to the death.
[306:37.52]The victors were given their freedom and a lot of money.
[306:41.23]The winners of the first few seasons have become some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the
[306:46.85]That was fucking scarring.
[306:48.21]Yeah, that was fucking horrible.
[306:52.12]I'm like forever changed from that one.
[307:02.10]Stop watching TV.
[307:02.74]You've also broadened it out.
[307:05.28]People from all over the world can take part now.
[307:08.63]During an economic recession, you have been inundated with applications.
[307:13.17]Do you see a correlation?
[307:15.43]If I didn't know any better, Chris, I'd say you were accusing me of exploiting the pool.
[307:18.67]I'm not the only person to see that link.
[307:21.09]There are many, many people who find your show and its practices abhorrent.
[307:29.46]Since the beginning of time, man's been pitted against his fellow man in combat.
[307:33.12]The Roman Colosseum.
[307:35.40]Actually, good effects, though.
[307:36.82]Not very realistic, but pretty good.
[307:38.18]I'm not so sure we have.
[307:40.10]I mean, that was fucked up.
[307:44.14]We know what people want.
[307:45.96]We choose what we also give them.
[307:48.71]It's a contract between us and the public.
[307:52.09]Are you really saying we should give them any old crap?
[307:55.17]Anything?
[307:55.67]Do you want another drink?
[307:59.83]Yeah.
[308:01.85]How many people are even left on our team?
[308:03.33]Nick, slow down.
[308:04.63]Let's take a breather.
[308:06.14]There's something up ahead.
[308:14.83]Can we please stop playing this?
[308:16.23]Um, I mean there's only two of us left What what what are you looking for You need to tell me what's going on
[308:45.31]Throw for content.
[308:46.03]I actually have not thrown at all for content.
[308:48.59]What are you saying, it's fake?
[308:49.93]We?
[309:11.97]I'm not here to win, Tish.
[309:15.56]I've been sent here by a group called the Alliance.
[309:22.12]They've sent me here to expose the truth.
[309:25.30]That the corporation used deep fake technology to rig the outcome of Kill Street.
[309:30.58]With a deep fake stuff?
[309:32.26]Computer generated scenarios.
[309:34.72]They can alter the broadcast in real time to make things play out the way they want.
[309:38.74]Why?
[309:39.12]Why can't they just let it play out?
[309:41.02]The winner's a puppet.
[309:42.84]All the fame and power that come from winning this thing can be controlled if they know who the winner is.
[309:47.82]Island Corp are fucked.
[309:49.22]They've been hemorrhaging money for years.
[309:50.72]They're on the ropes.
[309:51.30]Are they deep faking people dying?
[309:52.54]The cost of running this meat grinder adds up.
[309:54.82]The bribes, the countries that host it, the jurisdictions that broadcast it, the lawsuits from the contestants' estates.
[310:01.89]Then with audiences dwindling, they had to come up with a plan, so they started fixing it.
[310:06.45]We're not sure when, but when the creator left, there were big changes behind the scenes.
[310:11.60]The winners always became big stars, right?
[310:12.88]It goes all the way up to the top, man.
[310:14.68]All the way to the top, man.
[310:18.04]With the winners in their pockets, they've managed to keep things afloat for a while longer.
[310:21.71]But now they're getting desperate.
[310:23.81]That's why the rules keep getting more brutal.
[310:26.43]So you were being serious about the no tap outs.
[310:30.59]They're doing it to boost the ratings.
[310:34.05]And the puppet, who is it?
[310:35.09]I'm not sure yet.
[310:37.72]It's him.
[310:38.24]Let me.
[310:40.54]Sure.
[310:41.98]I'm the bad guy, probably, right?
[310:43.40]It's me.
[310:44.54]Who was I talking to on the phone before, on the walkie-talkie?
[310:52.29]It's me.
[310:53.09]It's gonna be me.
[310:53.47]Okay.
[310:53.83]Not bad.
[310:54.07]Okay.
[311:08.95]Let's just say I have a reason to hate Alancourt.
[311:11.09]We're all getting deepfaked.
[311:12.33]The Alliance knew this and it was a safe bet my... This is the last thing I'm playing before I'm done streaming.
[311:18.66]They gave me this device, a payload, that I need to plant in the Corporations Network.
[311:23.86]If they can get in, they can hijack the stream, expose it all, the deepfakes, the fics, everything.
[311:29.84]So why are you telling me this?
[311:32.46]Why isn't the Alliance helping you?
[311:35.73]They switched locations at the last moment.
[311:37.73]It wasn't known they had a mole.
[311:40.55]Last dream ever?
[311:41.81]No, I'm saying just for today.
[311:43.88]What about GPS?
[311:46.50]Or phones?
[311:47.48]Blocked.
[311:48.70]All signals in and out of this place go through Alan Corp's network.
[311:52.64]We're almost done.
[311:53.28]This device was meant to be invulnerable to their control, but the blast back there must have knocked it out.
[311:59.10]They're going to kill you.
[312:00.32]I didn't say this was bad.
[312:01.60]Do I trust her?
[312:02.30]What do you think?
[312:28.52]I don't know I don't think so I'm gonna keep hold of it for now they keep just doing the double cross thing no okay it's getting dark if there is a predetermined winner it could be anyone you have another tower then we know that so what if it's just her
[313:05.01]We should take it in turns keeping watch.
[313:06.87]Can you tell him to stop cursing please?
[313:08.63]Toss a coin?
[313:10.09]No need.
[313:11.81]You're concerned about cursing?
[313:12.94]Are you sure?
[313:13.64]And there was just like a gruesome scene with somebody's like face like blown off.
[313:17.28]May as well have the conversation.
[313:21.36]How'd you end up here?
[313:24.94]That's complicated.
[313:28.47]Answer.
[313:28.93]Why not?
[313:29.85]Not much call for an aging child actor.
[313:32.99]I didn't make the transition.
[313:35.33]You bleeped the swears?
[313:36.68]Sure.
[313:39.56]TV and film, that all changed.
[313:41.90]I will do that for you.
[313:43.78]Reality killed the TV store.
[313:47.46]Well, you're breaking my heart, Mikey.
[313:50.74]Fuck you.
[313:53.21]You blame the corporation for that?
[313:54.73]He missed it.
[313:59.09]You remember the other Nick?
[314:01.93]Nicky Merc?
[314:03.53]Yeah.
[314:04.07]You guys are like a double F for one.
[314:07.31]What we're doing, not a shelf life.
[314:10.37]Unless Hollywood chews you up and spits you out, what do you do?
[314:16.28]Anything you can to stay on top.
[314:18.28]I'm waiting.
[314:18.86]I'm trying to get it.
[314:20.22]So he did.
[314:22.82]Killstream Season 6.
[314:25.62]It's all starting to make sense.
[314:31.40]Drinking drugs made him a different person.
[314:35.38]Made him feel invincible.
[314:38.29]He thought this was the only way out.
[314:40.69]Deepfake.
[314:42.65]It is for some of us.
[314:51.56]I'm sorry.
[314:52.44]I didn't mean it.
[314:56.11]I wanted to do something for my family.
[314:59.11]I wanted to look after them.
[315:01.02]No, you didn't want to do that to me.
[315:03.92]It's about my own option.
[315:05.36]I don't know why I want this for all these cheaters.
[315:11.84]Someone tipping the scales.
[315:14.21]So, here I am.
[315:18.39]I don't want the ad revenue for my channel.
[315:20.89]Since I've been in here, that's gotta be something for them, right?
[315:24.63]Ugh.
[315:27.67]What do they think of all this?
[315:28.75]I told them.
[315:34.81]It'd be hard for them to miss by now though.
[315:39.05]Jesus.
[315:42.93]Oh my god.
[315:43.61]Alright.
[315:45.51]I haven't had a complaint about this game until right now.
[315:48.39]This is way too long.
[315:51.75]And you're sleeping in the subway station.
[315:54.92]I thought you didn't watch those movies.
[315:57.13]Come on.
[315:58.61]They were everywhere when I was a kid.
[316:01.63]Of course I watched those movies.
[316:04.35]Don't, wait, don't kiss or kiss.
[316:07.51]Don't kiss or kiss.
[316:10.03]We can kiss?
[316:17.43]We can, we can kiss, I guess.
[316:19.71]Are we going to both be kissing each other?
[316:28.68]Premarital kissing.
[316:29.76]Gross.
[316:34.11]So what happens if you have a romance in this movie game thing?
[316:37.55]I don't understand.
[316:48.27]Alright.
[316:48.65]Don't we need to... Don't do it.
[316:52.03]Put a sensor bar on.
[316:53.23]Okay.
[316:53.33]Okay.
[316:57.58]Oh, they're a soldier.
[317:01.91]Let's get some sleep.
[317:07.31]Okay, if it... Alright.
[317:08.95]If it was attempt kiss or don't, I wouldn't have done that.
[317:33.12]Unbelievable.
[317:35.18]Tish Tasker and Nick Romeo are still in the game.
[317:40.26]Maybe there's more than meets the eye with these two.
[317:43.92]See?
[317:44.46]I thought it was like, this will happen.
[317:47.02]Do not attempt, or this will happen.
[317:49.63]Oh, mate, fuck off.
[317:51.81]Can't keep a good guy down, huh?
[317:53.51]Hey, Nick.
[317:54.33]Go, Nick.
[317:57.29]Lucky son of a bitch.
[317:59.63]Slippery fucker.
[318:02.15]kelvin you head east keeping on him don't worry buddy I'll look after you hello how are you
[318:31.07]That phone was terrible.
[318:51.70]This is why I did.
[318:52.22]I mean,
[318:58.27]What's going on here?
[318:59.57]What's up?
[319:00.51]Where were you?
[319:01.39]That what was really suspect.
[319:05.11]That was weird.
[319:08.11]Yeah, oh god damn it.
[319:16.10]No, I don't trust anybody.
[319:18.84]Calvin, right?
[319:21.88]You're not Calvin Biggs, are you?
[319:25.46]Oh my god, it is you.
[319:28.77]You were on America's Most Wanted, right?
[319:30.47]Hey, there was a cry in shame, but they did.
[319:33.85]Goddamn lamestream media and their goddamn witch hunts.
[319:36.43]I mean, so what if you took a busload of school kids hostage?
[319:41.66]You only killed the teacher.
[319:47.45]You sure you saw something?
[319:49.11]I said I might have seen an antenna.
[319:51.33]What other options do we have?
[319:53.55]What's this about an antenna?
[319:54.83]Oh!
[319:55.57]Don't even think about it.
[319:56.79]No, we were wrong.
[319:57.70]I'm sorry.
[319:58.36]I was very wrong.
[319:59.14]It could have taken you both down.
[320:01.90]Then why didn't you, douchebag?
[320:04.12]With a mouth like that, it just might.
[320:05.40]Otto, I'm so sorry.
[320:06.88]Can we start over?
[320:08.36]You were listening.
[320:11.31]We need to work together.
[320:13.47]That's not what you said to me last time we met.
[320:17.12]Look, I'm so sorry.
[320:18.86]You said you were a camper in Call of Duty or whatever it was.
[320:23.08]There's more going on here than you know.
[320:26.46]Lower the gun and let's talk.
[320:31.42]Camping's a really good strategy.
[320:33.42]It keeps your kill death high.
[320:34.67]You get to enjoy the game.
[320:37.73]You can eat a sandwich while you're playing.
[320:39.11]You don't have to have two hands on the controller.
[320:41.51]I mean, that's a pain in the ass.
[320:44.20]What's the difference between this island and a dead prostitute?
[320:54.28]Uh, Otto hears me saying Otto and is walking over here now.
[320:59.34]Hello, Otto.
[321:00.78]Well, it's a different Otto, not you.
[321:05.24]This island still sucks.
[321:11.15]Now we get a new party.
[321:12.39]Why don't get it?
[321:13.87]If they can fake bits of it, why not fake the whole thing?
[321:17.13]Why bother going to the expense of hosting it in the first place?
[321:20.98]Let's get Otto involved here.
[321:24.48]Too many variables.
[321:26.64]All the drama, power struggles, randomness of people is hard to script.
[321:31.66]Plus, I don't know whether you noticed, but... You want 50% auto-cam, 50% game that everybody apparently hates that I'm streaming?
[321:36.42]50% auto-cam?
[321:36.84]So, who is it?
[321:55.66]Stop.
[321:55.88]He needs something.
[321:57.40]I've got my suspicions, but... Are you hungry?
[322:21.49]Where's the fleet?
[322:22.65]West.
[322:22.91]I'm gonna take him out and give him a little snack.
[322:25.37]And then I'll put a 50% auto-cam up, I promise.
[322:28.11]Has to be something.
[322:29.93]Just to get to a point where I can freeze it.
[322:33.80]There we go.
[322:34.40]Okay.
[322:35.56]This is gonna be the last BRB of the night.
[322:37.52]I'll be right back.
[322:39.04]And then we'll have a 50% auto-cam.
[324:51.66]So,
[325:45.91]Alright, let's see how, if the auto cam will work.
[326:26.52]Autocam.
[326:31.16]Okay.
[326:34.32]If he sits down, let's see.
[326:35.71]Auto.
[326:35.81]50% autocam.
[327:03.36]But you can't see the game!
[327:04.84]Okay, can you see the game?
[327:14.20]Control room reporting in.
[327:15.68]We've lost contact with Romeo.
[327:18.69]Continuing sweep of the area.
[327:22.03]Now we're cooking down to the final 10.
[327:25.55]Can you feel it?
[327:26.27]Who cares about the game?
[327:27.23]You can eat this tension with a spoon!
[327:30.29]Nick Romeo is still M.I.A.
[327:31.91]What do you think of your pie?
[327:33.36]Maybe there's still hope.
[327:35.24]Or maybe the pieces are just too small.
[327:38.84]This is strange.
[327:39.80]They're not showing anything.
[327:41.34]This is bullshit.
[327:41.90]What the fuck is going on?
[327:43.14]The show's really gone downhill.
[327:48.10]Oh, the show's gone downhill.
[327:50.76]There's two clicks west, just past those trees.
[327:53.18]Past the mines?
[327:54.92]We just gotta get through the field.
[327:56.59]Isn't there another way around?
[327:57.73]The ring of mines around the island is 200 meters wide.
[328:00.83]Oh no, Otto.
[328:02.31]This open ground, it gives us an advantage.
[328:05.77]Otto, you're on like a bright red blanket.
[328:08.39]This is way too... It doesn't contrast well at all.
[328:10.34]Live Otto reaction.
[328:11.22]Go on.
[328:28.51]Well, you said those guys use the mines to blow up the bridge?
[328:30.83]Yeah.
[328:31.55]That means one of those assholes has figured out how to rig those mines to blow up on command.
[328:35.76]That means it can be hacked.
[328:37.22]If it can be hacked, then I can figure out how they're armed and... You have an itchy head?
[328:41.18]So, what, we take a live mine and deactivate it by hacking?
[328:46.09]Oh, he's itching his ear.
[328:46.99]That sounds like it's gonna take forever.
[328:49.42]Only for the first one.
[328:50.46]These mines are smart, which means it's probably part of a mesh network.
[328:55.47]They send a signal to arm, disarm from mine to mine.
[328:59.27]If I can figure out how to break one of these guys' security, I can maybe disarm the whole thing.
[329:05.00]At least the area we're in.
[329:06.86]Wow, that sounds like a...
[329:10.09]Okay, then, fuckers.
[329:11.47]Why don't you go grab a big stick and get ready to prod and poke your way through the next 200 meters of open ground, meter by meter.
[329:17.61]I'm sure there's no risk there at all.
[329:18.86]I haven't been paying any attention to this.
[329:20.70]What happened?
[329:21.10]Otto's plan.
[329:24.48]I don't even know what it is, so I'm just gonna do it.
[329:26.42]Come on, then, nerd.
[329:27.62]Go get you a mind to play with.
[329:29.34]Are you fucking kidding me?
[329:31.06]He's gonna blow himself up.
[329:35.46]Fuck it.
[329:36.32]I guess he wouldn't be that big of a loss anyway.
[329:38.65]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[329:40.07]What are you doing?
[329:41.29]It's Otto's plan.
[329:42.05]I was going to hack the mine.
[329:42.97]I need a computer.
[329:45.79]Don't make sure it's not sending out anything that can track us.
[329:48.81]It'll be dark.
[329:49.95]What's wrong with your ear, Itchy?
[329:50.79]You have an itchy ear?
[329:53.57]He actually had an ear problem.
[330:00.52]I needed to put this stuff in his ears.
[330:02.04]This is a bad idea.
[330:07.11]Okay.
[330:07.79]He's okay though.
[330:09.21]That should do it.
[330:13.15]How do we know if it works?
[330:15.30]Well, if I walk over here.
[330:18.38]Crash his ear for him.
[330:19.58]Everything within a three meter radius should be disabled.
[330:23.86]He had to get this little goo put in both of his ears.
[330:26.48]Try it.
[330:27.48]You fucking try it.
[330:29.24]You're holding it.
[330:29.90]Do 75% auto.
[330:30.12]Careful.
[330:38.23]Wait, what?
[330:45.41]Probably just gonna go to sleep.
[330:48.24]What the fuck was that?
[330:49.70]Holy shit!
[330:51.38]You fucking idiot!
[330:53.20]It didn't work.
[330:54.00]Oh, really?
[330:55.18]At least I gave it a go.
[330:56.40]You nearly got us killed, not to mention wasted our time.
[330:59.54]And that might get us in company.
[331:01.08]We'll have to move fast.
[331:02.65]What was plan B again?
[331:23.35]What was that?
[331:30.01]Keep the pace.
[331:34.83]Doesn't matter.
[331:35.79]We step out of mind, we're just as dead.
[331:38.59]Concentrate on what we're doing.
[331:41.38]85% auto, 10% movie, 5% facecam.
[331:54.14]Alright, hold on.
[331:54.72]There's people like aiming at me.
[331:56.81]I'm sorry.
[332:07.29]I'm like ruining this whole game.
[332:13.14]I'm sorry.
[332:15.16]I got out of that alive.
[332:16.38]I didn't even do anything.
[332:37.48]I told you that was gonna happen.
[332:39.03]I fucking told- Oh wait, wrong person.
[332:41.61]It was literally the wrong guy.
[332:44.75]It was the other guy.
[332:47.13]Fuck!
[332:50.21]Don't go anywhere, folks.
[332:51.47]We'll be back in just a shake.
[332:53.64]Yo, you seen this on the subreddit?
[332:56.12]Deepfakes.
[332:57.24]Yeah, I'm not buying it.
[332:58.48]Something's not right.
[332:59.88]They're saying that's why Romeo is there.
[333:02.13]It's all a fix.
[333:03.71]Shut up.
[333:04.01]You need to be able to see what's going on.
[333:16.44]It's not far now.
[333:20.92]Really?
[333:22.46]Why are you listening to him?
[333:26.62]Oh, we've come this far.
[333:28.06]Yeah, but where are we going?
[333:29.14]Okay, I was about to say I'm going to walk out of the theater, but he said we've come this far.
[333:32.86]Don't fucking tell me to chill.
[333:33.92]So I was just like, shit.
[333:34.84]Like, they're right.
[333:35.34]Why don't you tell Nick about yourself?
[333:36.72]Trish, come on.
[333:37.24]We've got to keep moving.
[333:38.28]He's not just some glory-seeking wannabe.
[333:43.89]Otto here is convicted of swatting another streamer.
[333:47.43]Well, Otto did not do that.
[333:49.09]No.
[333:49.35]Swatting?
[333:50.44]called the cops and said there was a hostage situation at the house of another player, so they would send an armed response.
[333:58.46]And what happened, Otto?
[333:59.82]He was killed.
[334:03.81]I didn't mean to- Look, I don't care about anyone's past.
[334:09.37]The fact is, we're already in this situation and we have to keep going.
[334:13.85]How do we know he's not the puppet?
[334:16.41]How do we know you're not the fucking puppet?
[334:18.01]You're the fucking dog!
[334:19.13]Hey, stop!
[334:19.71]Stop!
[334:20.07]Because it's me.
[334:21.85]I'm the main character is the puppet.
[334:23.95]It's me.
[334:24.51]What's that?
[334:26.57]I might as well just tell them at this point.
[334:28.56]You shouldn't be out this far.
[334:30.50]Come on.
[334:35.64]Bravo 2, we got some movement in sector B. Here.
[334:48.95]I kind of want to just finish this movie so I can put it back in the blu-ray case and just put it in the closet.
[334:56.84]You know, I don't want to have it be sitting in my PS4 after I just kind of stop watching it.
[335:05.10]You know what I mean?
[335:05.98]Like, I've got to complete it so I can put it in the case and put it in the closet.
[335:08.08]Alright, well...
[335:17.24]This is difficult because... She woke up earlier before I did, and... She... I don't know, she was doing something behind the building, and then she was like, What?
[335:30.06]Huh?
[335:30.36]What?
[335:32.21]And then we already kind of betrayed Otto.
[335:35.07]But then Otto... It...
[335:53.09]Auto at low opacity and put the stream behind him.
[336:01.90]Alright.
[336:02.26]Well, I'll go with auto because auto is the dog name.
[336:05.22]And if I don't click auto, then everyone's going to be pissed.
[336:11.67]You don't like that guy.
[336:13.33]You like my dog.
[336:17.05]You like this auto.
[336:19.81]Oh, look at him.
[336:22.52]He's so long and chunky.
[336:24.97]Look at his big chunky butt.
[336:28.69]He's like a seal.
[336:34.83]Uh oh.
[336:36.16]Yeah.
[336:50.83]You sure?
[336:52.21]Just before the drone came.
[336:55.67]Look, I know coming from me.
[336:57.11]What if he's making this up?
[336:58.99]Here's the problem.
[336:59.87]What if he called the drone?
[337:01.01]He's just putting it on her.
[337:09.31]But it's Otto.
[337:11.01]We need to confront her.
[337:11.85]Dude, I think we need to get the fuck out of here.
[337:13.41]We're not just ditching her.
[337:18.63]Okay, then.
[337:25.19]Is he right?
[337:25.57]Uh oh.
[337:31.39]Is he aiming at my head?
[337:32.09]Oh god.
[337:34.95]He's aiming at me.
[337:36.83]Oh, I thought Otto was aiming at me.
[337:38.09]Here come the... yeah.
[337:56.14]remember us you and me we just need a little chat what the hell is going on speed run 100 auto run yourself up and I'll let her go no I mean didn't I tell you that near the end I was gonna have to have a sacrifice
[338:25.15]But here's the thing.
[338:25.87]What if they're making this up?
[338:27.05]What if they're working together?
[338:29.63]This could just be an elaborate ruse.
[338:37.73]This is an elaborate ruse.
[338:38.85]Fuck you.
[338:40.61]They're working.
[338:41.53]I knew it.
[338:41.99]I told you.
[338:42.75]Yep.
[338:44.37]What are you doing?
[338:45.21]We need him.
[338:47.23]God damn it.
[338:48.27]I knew it.
[338:54.05]He won't get far.
[338:56.39]No, not her.
[338:57.63]Otto!
[338:57.81]We know where he's going.
[339:04.41]I've been looking forward to this.
[339:07.01]We had the red- We had the redemption arc, too.
[339:09.01]Just remember, you needed the help of a man to take me down.
[339:25.04]And this is the end for Otto Blakely.
[339:27.78]Necro to his fans, and now just plain necrotic to the rest of us.
[339:32.56]Okay, so now what is the climax of this whole thing, right?
[339:40.54]You're not really taking either personal responsibility or even personal engagement.
[339:46.57]How would it be if I went over now and I just took your cravat and strangled you with it?
[339:50.79]I quite like this cravat.
[339:51.73]I wouldn't mind dying in this cravat, actually.
[339:53.31]It's one of my favorite ones.
[339:54.69]You're just at the beginning.
[340:07.24]Why don't you want to lift people up?
[340:09.13]You have that opportunity.
[340:10.39]And we, believe it or not, we do have a responsibility.
[340:14.37]Do you have any sense of responsibility?
[340:17.89]One of the beauties of living in a modern society is that, in our shows at least, it's down to the consent... Put your face on Otto's.
[340:27.06]But I'm saying you're not engaged in the argument.
[340:29.46]He's using the webcam.
[340:30.48]For you, it's just a job.
[340:31.96]I can't do that.
[340:32.92]And these are people's lives!
[340:36.79]We must watch that we don't abuse the medium.
[340:39.83]We must watch that we don't sink down.
[340:41.97]I want to have a bath.
[340:43.82]I want to have a shower and a bath and another shower and another bath after I've seen your program.
[340:50.38]Is there no limit?
[340:51.90]Do you not have any limit?
[340:55.76]In the end, what would be too much for you?
[340:59.01]Have you no shame?
[341:06.22]Okay, so what happens here?
[341:08.62]How does this end?
[341:12.58]The acting?
[341:13.20]The acting's not even bad.
[341:15.36]That was like good acting.
[341:16.62]That wasn't bad acting.
[341:17.58]What are you talking about?
[341:18.24]I mean, some of the acting is not good.
[341:42.07]You think he's a bad actor?
[341:50.32]I think that guy's pretty good.
[341:56.66]Where the fuck have you been?
[341:59.68]I got this so wrong.
[342:01.00]I thought this guy was going to die first and they kept him through the whole game.
[342:04.57]Fucking hell.
[342:06.35]Tell me about it.
[342:22.88]Like, comedy relief guy.
[342:24.66]Yeah.
[342:31.00]Stealth takedown.
[342:35.20]How do you do a stealth takedown if someone's looking at you?
[342:41.66]I don't know how I got over here.
[342:45.80]What?
[342:51.86]What?
[342:56.30]Yeah, search.
[342:58.18]Where did the knife come from?
[343:09.69]I don't remember.
[343:10.11]It was makeup?
[343:18.69]No.
[343:19.71]No, I don't think so.
[343:26.40]what do you mean it was makeup alright dad it's makeup yeah go fast fast fast fast fast really fast oh he didn't even say anything
[343:55.73]What do you have?
[344:03.39]Another gun upgrade.
[344:04.25]Nice.
[344:13.62]Go, go, get in there.
[344:25.88]Hurry!
[344:42.81]Nick.
[344:44.41]Let's talk.
[344:44.83]What'd you say?
[344:46.43]We can still get on the blower and get this all sorted.
[344:48.45]Are you awake again?
[344:53.57]Okay.
[344:53.95]But we're almost there.
[344:56.83]What?
[344:58.19]The finale.
[345:05.22]Wait, what?
[345:06.04]What chance do you think you had, you fucking muppet?
[345:10.60]See?
[345:12.52]The decision's already been made.
[345:14.52]Okay, but I'm still alive.
[345:15.92]Oh, the deepfakes are out there.
[345:17.70]As far as the world knows, you're already dead.
[345:21.83]I can easily just show up and be alive.
[345:23.41]Oh my god, I can't believe they just showed that.
[345:25.47]Well, I don't remember that happening.
[345:30.45]Everyone gets shot through their right eye, by the way.
[345:48.46]There we have it, folks!
[345:49.90]The winner is crowned!
[345:52.14]What a year!
[345:53.57]More ups and downs than a bipolar rollercoaster.
[345:58.47]Now what?
[345:58.83]Put the gun down, Tish.
[346:01.71]So we made it to the last two.
[346:03.13]That's not true.
[346:04.47]It doesn't have to end like this.
[346:07.81]What about the girl with the blood in her mouth?
[346:11.27]Maybe.
[346:12.19]She just dipped out.
[346:12.95]There are no guarantees.
[346:15.23]We haven't seen her.
[346:17.67]What then?
[346:19.31]This right here is the ultimate prize, Nick.
[346:22.39]That's bullshit.
[346:23.71]You just don't get it, do you?
[346:26.42]You may have lost your fame, your fortune, your friend.
[346:29.62]You got shot seven times?
[346:31.96]I never had any of that to begin with.
[346:34.76]I came here for my family and now I can have it all.
[346:38.74]And to hell with everyone else.
[346:41.26]You can't change it, Nick.
[346:43.12]We gotta look out for ourselves.
[346:44.56]There's a better way.
[346:46.46]We can put an end to all this bloodshed.
[346:48.32]You are better than this, Tish.
[346:49.83]You don't know me.
[346:51.11]Who I am.
[346:53.05]You still have a choice.
[346:54.37]I never had a choice, Nick.
[347:01.03]Don't do it.
[347:02.65]Your move.
[347:03.13]Fine.
[347:04.36]Don't make me do it.
[347:05.32]Don't make me do it.
[347:06.74]Please.
[347:07.18]Please.
[347:11.99]Tish, never point a gun at something you don't intend to kill.
[347:13.86]Oh, you did intend to kill me.
[347:15.31]Okay, well, never mind.
[347:42.21]Oh.
[347:42.59]Oh.
[347:42.95]Oh.
[348:15.03]The broadcast is out.
[348:17.63]You're dead anyway.
[348:20.33]Not if I skip the ending cutscene.
[348:23.70]I can do my own deep fake.
[348:40.71]Chaotic laughter.
[348:50.65]Do I live?
[348:54.29]Do I survive that?
[349:01.84]That was probably a really bad ending.
[349:05.28]Oh, it's gonna be after credits.
[349:12.00]It's a battle royale, you won, but I didn't win though.
[349:17.01]Because they fake the whole thing with CG characters.
[349:23.02]Like one of the characters was saying earlier, what is the point of even doing this show if you can just have realistic, completely uncanny valley, real people CG of people doing this?
[349:35.27]What's the point of doing this in real life?
[349:49.62]That might be the worst ending.
[349:50.83]It could be.
[349:51.75]It's probably at least like five endings.
[350:06.51]Full screen auto?
[350:07.29]Well, hold on.
[350:07.93]Not yet.
[350:15.71]In one of the other endings, you hack the stuff and release the deepfake info.
[350:19.49]Oh, okay.
[350:19.79]Alright.
[350:26.48]Let's skip the credits and see what happens.
[350:33.30]There's nothing there.
[350:39.15]Is that it?
[350:39.41]Is that it?
[350:47.75]I think that's it.
[350:52.44]Oh.
[351:00.08]No morale.
[351:01.52]Nobody likes me.
[351:02.98]Nobody loves me.
[351:04.68]But I'm strong and smart.
[351:08.07]I guess.
[351:17.02]No one likes me, but I'm very strong and very smart.
[351:20.36]Okay.
[351:25.21]Decisions made.
[351:26.57]54 scenes viewed.
[351:27.39]This is 294 scenes.
[351:29.45]Holy shit.
[351:33.23]Damn.
[351:33.63]Okay.
[351:36.15]No romances.
[351:39.98]Alright, I'm going to do one thing before we go.
[351:41.79]There's a short video I want to watch.
[351:44.95]It's a short sorcery film about this stream and the sorcery game.
[351:53.39]But the stream is essentially over.
[351:57.64]Next time I'll be live will likely be next weekend, probably on either Friday or Saturday.
[352:02.52]Okay.
[352:04.47]Or Sunday?
[352:06.01]Keep an eye on the sus.
[352:07.89]Likely Sunday.
[352:09.21]Either maybe Friday and Sunday.
[352:10.81]Or maybe just Sunday.
[352:11.47]Pet Otto first.
[352:21.93]No, Otto.
[352:23.11]No, Otto.
[352:23.89]I'm gonna pet you.
[352:25.32]I'm gonna pet Mr. Otto.
[352:26.08]Scratch his bum.
[352:29.32]Do you have a scratchy bum?
[352:32.94]Do you?
[352:35.98]Oh my goodness.
[352:38.82]You have a scratchy leg.
[352:42.26]Good boy.
[352:46.69]It's... Otto.
[352:50.71]It's Otto.
[352:51.17]It's Otto.
[352:53.87]It's Otto.
[352:59.26]Showing you his penguin stripe.
[353:00.40]Okay.
[353:01.52]I'm going to grab this video real quick.
[353:05.54]Give me one second while I grab it.
[353:10.34]But that's going to conclude, essentially, the gaming portion of the stream.
[353:14.48]And I think this video is like two or three minutes, four minutes, something like that.
[353:20.38]Those of you that have never seen the Sorcery playthrough, it's one of the first streams I really did on Twitch when I went to, quote, I'm a streamer now.
[353:31.79]What, 2015, 2016?
[353:39.82]um okay link is okay
[354:03.84]The door of the stone building is slammed and the walk turns over behind you.
[354:08.22]Hold on.
[354:10.62]No, no.
[354:10.98]That was good luck on the first grade.
[354:16.80]The door of the stone building is... Alright, let me get this shit out of here first of all.
[354:26.93]I haven't played anyone.
[354:33.01]Okay.
[354:38.32]Alright, you ready?
[354:40.14]This is called Zap the Old Man, a sorcery tribute.
[354:55.09]And here we go.
[355:00.39]Three, two, one, go.
[355:04.21]The door of the stone building is slammed and the lock turns over behind you.
[355:18.29]Is this gonna be a better movie?
[355:20.80]A bench against one wall is the only piece of furniture where an old man sits.
[355:26.50]We're gonna go talk to him.
[355:28.42]This is a better movie.
[355:30.68]Greetings, old man.
[355:32.18]He ignores you.
[355:33.52]He is concentrating hard on something on the ground just in front of him.
[355:38.40]You glance upwards to the stars and suddenly the old man shouts, A sorcerer!
[355:43.86]I knew it!
[355:44.74]You're mistaken.
[355:45.54]You reply cautiously.
[355:47.06]Oh, I don't think so.
[355:48.96]You'll get us out of here.
[355:50.36]Better yet, I haven't played anyone for months.
[355:53.03]Certainly not anyone smart.
[355:55.11]Sit down, sit down.
[355:56.85]Play what?
[355:58.05]Oh, I swindle stones, of course.
[356:00.93]Swindle stones?
[356:01.77]Stranger in town?
[356:03.33]Don't know how to play?
[356:04.13]Better and better.
[356:06.25]He shows you one of his stones.
[356:07.70]It is a strange four value to die.
[356:10.40]He pats the bench beside him with one hand.
[356:13.28]Sit, play.
[356:15.32]We can talk while I beat you.
[356:18.66]This is really, really well made.
[356:20.22]I'll go first, show you how it's done.
[356:23.26]The game is simple.
[356:24.71]We roll and bet on what's come up.
[356:27.95]For instance, I might start and bet that between us, we've rolled at least two twos.
[356:32.57]Well, how do I know what you have?
[356:35.43]Three twos.
[356:36.43]Didn't you hear my last bid?
[356:38.04]That was a clue at least.
[356:39.66]Unless I'm trying to mislead you.
[356:41.32]Four twos.
[356:42.91]I think you're trying to mislead me.
[356:45.39]Yeah, he had fucking two twos.
[356:47.53]So I get the die.
[356:48.43]I win.
[356:49.25]When you win a round of Swindle Stones, the other person loses a die.
[356:53.59]This game is so good, by the way.
[356:54.73]Do you know Kare well?
[356:55.69]Two ones.
[356:56.35]Should do.
[356:57.05]They're here for 20 years now.
[356:59.07]Two threes.
[356:59.37]Hold on.
[356:59.96]I need directions.
[357:01.28]Three threes.
[357:02.20]Oh, yes?
[357:03.24]Where are two?
[357:04.24]Four threes.
[357:04.70]Want to see a new streamer meta?
[357:05.80]Not yours.
[357:06.66]Call it.
[357:08.84]So he loses another die.
[357:11.25]And he's at even more of a disadvantage.
[357:13.21]So, what did they get you for?
[357:15.69]One-one.
[357:16.33]It's a mistake.
[357:17.51]One-two.
[357:18.05]Oh, I bet it was.
[357:19.27]Mine was lifting from a red eye.
[357:21.31]Two ones.
[357:22.36]You can't be a very good pickpocket, then.
[357:24.18]Call!
[357:27.77]fucking old man what do you know about the north gate of the city two ones it's wizard locked with a spell and only the first noble knows it two fours this is important so tell me everything you know three fours they say the spell is four lines and four nobles know one line each four fours that's good advice call
[357:52.45]I win, don't I?
[357:53.81]There they go.
[357:54.25]That's Swindlestones.
[357:55.83]I was going easy on you, of course.
[357:58.13]Rematch?
[357:59.28]Thanks for the game.
[358:00.64]I enjoyed beating you.
[358:02.56]The casual is mine.
[358:04.64]That door looks sick.
[358:05.16]We go over to the door, locked, of course, from the outside.
[358:09.36]Oh, really?
[358:11.31]Is it really?
[358:14.07]Well, door, you're about to get fucking zopped.
[358:19.18]God, there's explosions.
[358:20.95]I wish I had a pebble.
[358:23.51]Just blow the door straight off.
[358:27.15]Well, you know what we can do?
[358:29.01]Dopp.
[358:30.99]What are the other options?
[358:31.99]I'm just curious.
[358:34.74]Is dopp this pop?
[358:38.32]Zip.
[358:39.90]Cause teleportation.
[358:40.84]I don't have the green ring.
[358:44.52]Zap.
[358:47.37]Zap the fucking door.
[358:50.80]Cast a spell winding a powerful charge of electricity inside your wrist.
[358:54.83]Ready to unleash Zap the Old Man!
[359:02.84]No reason to listen to this old man's horse breathing.
[359:06.73]One instant he is there, the next the room is filled with smoke and the smell of cooked bacon.
[359:13.11]That's so fucked up.
[359:17.71]You settle down on the bench to wait out the night in silence.
[359:25.36]I would definitely subscribe.
[359:31.58]The door of the stone building is slammed.
[359:33.74]Yeah, I would subscribe.
[359:35.08]That video is fucking unbelievable.
[359:38.46]That was very, very, very well made.
[359:44.26]That was exceptional.
[359:45.41]Here's the channel.
[359:57.27]Oh yeah, I would absolutely subscribe.
[360:04.84]That was fucking unbelievable.
[360:07.93]Even the zap and the CG is after effects.
[360:11.29]You know what you're doing.
[360:14.31]Swindle stones should be the new streamer meta.
[360:21.36]I feel like that would be a lot of content.
[360:30.90]uh thank you for that video that's unbelievable that was by uh Dr. masaki very nice it would just compare it to a squid game
[360:55.63]Yeah, but not if you had... No, it has to be... No.
[360:58.47]Well, I guess it would, because the... You know.
[361:00.73]You know.
[361:01.69]Those that have seen Squid Game, we know.
[361:08.50]He doesn't get it.
[361:09.26]I... Look, I don't... I... Yes, I do.
[361:12.02]Of course I do.
[361:15.78]I'll see you guys later.
[361:21.08]I'll see you guys next week, and have a great week.
[361:28.45]Oh, it's probably going to be Friday.
[361:33.23]Keep an eye on the sus.
[361:34.45]Looking like it'll be Friday afternoon.
[361:42.34]Play sorcery.
[361:44.88]I already did, though.
[361:48.32]I don't think I can go back and replicate that.
[361:56.10]New era of sorcery?
[362:01.26]I don't know.
[362:01.56]I feel like it sits in a place for me where I want to preserve that.
[362:07.47]I had so much fun.
[362:08.21]It was so many fun streams in a row that I don't want to go back and remake it.
[362:14.59]I feel like it wouldn't be as interesting.
[362:23.31]Maybe sensory stream?
[362:24.35]Yeah, I know.
[362:25.31]There's a lot of stuff that I'm going to be working on this week.
[362:28.75]Maybe I'll go tap into that too.
[362:39.67]That was a lot of fun.
[362:44.22]All three of those games had interesting things to experience.
[362:49.22]Although, holy shit, man.
[362:50.62]I'm still thinking of that lady and her mouth.
[362:55.29]I'm going to need to go watch baby sensory videos.
[362:59.85]That was fucked up.
[363:15.67]Do I even have... Let me see my Steam.
[363:23.34]I think I have, like, another couple of FMV games that... I've just been sitting there.
[363:29.17]That Deathstalker game, I've had for a long time.
[363:36.61]Let me see...
[363:45.27]I swear to God, this is at least not the two or three that I've not played.
[363:47.60]Because honestly, I looked at this the other day.
[363:52.76]At the games that I've got on Steam.
[363:55.44]And I kind of just did some reorganization.
[363:59.37]And one of the things I realized, I was like, what are these?
[364:01.87]I bought these like years ago with the intent on doing like a video on them or streaming them.
[364:05.53]And I just never did.
[364:07.65]At least that one.
[364:08.45]I bought that one, I know, at least six months ago.
[364:17.51]When did that come out on Steam?
[364:20.67]Very curious.
[364:23.47]Yeah, that came out almost two years ago.
[364:26.28]More than a year ago.
[364:28.46]I may have actually bought it last year, like in 2020.
[364:30.22]I was like, let's do it.
[364:45.35]Alright, I'll see you guys on Friday.
[364:48.41]And one of the things we might be doing on Friday is Etalyx and I might be playing Resident Evil 6.
[364:55.94]It's very possible.
[364:58.88]We'll see.
[365:03.16]We talked about it.
[365:17.29]Dark Pictures Anthology stuff?
[365:18.65]Yeah, we... I want to play, like, Resident Evil 6 more.
[365:22.05]The more that I think about it, I'm like, oh, I actually kind of, like, want... I feel like I would have more fun playing that.
[365:38.99]Raid somebody, you dork.
[365:39.95]Oh, hold on.
[365:40.63]Let me see.
[365:41.27]Who's even live?
[365:41.95]Etalyx is live right now.
[365:43.09]Isn't he?
[365:47.22]Let's see.
[365:58.49]What is he doing?
[366:05.26]Playing RimWorld.
[366:06.34]I just stole it from you right now.
[366:09.38]Before you got to the copyright office.
[366:10.70]So... You just got screwed.
[366:14.78]Yeah, we'll raid Etalyx.
[366:16.10]We're going to be hanging out with him probably this week anyway, so go say hello.
[366:22.40]It's been a while since we've raided Etalyx.
[366:30.17]Playing RimWorld, if that's not your thing, that's not your thing.
[366:32.27]If it is, then he plays it all the time.
[366:36.08]And I will see you guys later.
[366:37.24]Have a great week.
[366:38.04]Take care of yourselves.
[366:43.22]See you Friday.
[366:44.22]Or another day.
[366:48.60]Take care.
[366:49.18]Good night.
[366:49.48]And goodbye.
[367:19.24]Thank you.
