[02:06.77]Would you like to let the government spy on you?
[02:10.42]New carrier update where we can, like, get into your phone and spy on you.
[02:15.33]Wow, that's actually kind of funny, right?
[02:16.43]When I open up Watch Dogs.
[02:18.69]Carrier settings.
[02:20.37]Okay.
[02:20.83]Oh, okay, I'm not playing on PC.

[02:40.16]Alright, so... How are you doing?
[02:41.46]Are you, like, ready?
[02:42.02]Look, they gave me the tutorial about the co-op missions.
[02:45.84]Do you have to do the, like, thing in the park?
[02:52.03]Uh, maybe.
[02:53.09]I don't think so.
[02:53.71]They give you, like, a little mission to track.
[02:55.17]Like, reach the mission Dolores Park.
[02:58.41]Like, 150 meters away.
[02:59.77]I was trying to get rid of the chat.
[03:03.97]I was going to stay in my menu for a minute.
[03:08.17]Yeah, you have to.
[03:10.85]That thing doesn't take very long, though.
[03:12.45]So you do have to do this.
[03:14.73]I don't think you do, but you probably do.
[03:16.51]Just do it.
[03:17.57]Oh, oh, nope.
[03:18.23]There's multiplayer.
[03:19.83]There you go.
[03:20.09]Alright, hold on.
[03:20.87]Give me... I still have to get my legs.
[03:22.19]That's okay.
[03:22.81]I got plenty of time.
[03:23.49]Dashboard up.
[03:26.89]Twitch alerts.
[03:28.09]God, man.
[03:29.29]I didn't even make a tweet about this.
[03:34.41]iStream.
[03:35.61]iDramaStream, rather.
[03:37.93]Yeah.
[03:39.40]So, Etalyx... The way I have to do console recording is I use an HD60, an Elgato HD60.
[03:47.35]Product sucks, okay?
[03:49.10]Like, Elgato HD60 sucks.
[03:52.48]Um...
[03:54.44]What like a defamation?
[03:56.48]They will never sponsor you now.
[04:00.59]So I have to like delay my audio and the game audio because this thing takes like a full two seconds to like pull the game into OBS.
[04:08.93]And then I have to like delay Etalyx.
[04:10.13]So like we're not going to be matched up.
[04:11.55]Etalyx is going to be talking.
[04:12.49]Let's say words at the same time just to highlight.
[04:14.65]Let's talk at the same time.
[04:16.28]Okay.
[04:17.54]Alright, so ready?
[04:18.30]1, 2, 3, start talking at the same time.
[04:19.52]You didn't... No, you first.
[04:22.04]Do you see what happened?
[04:23.56]Everything got all screwed up.
[04:25.09]My brain's screwed up.
[04:29.33]Let me launch this.
[04:31.01]We said, let's start talking in 1, 2, 3, and neither of us spoke.
[04:34.25]Alright, 1, 2, 3.
[04:38.25]Does anyone else hear a ringing sound?
[04:39.87]What?
[04:41.19]Please don't tell me that's happening.
[04:43.06]If there is a ringing sound right now, I'm going to fucking delete myself from this video game.
[04:52.52]Alright.
[04:54.33]Okay, there's Twitch alerts.
[04:55.59]Somebody just gave...
[04:57.94]Five hundred bits.
[05:00.44]Oh, I forgot.
[05:00.82]I need to like... Hold on.
[05:02.48]Okay, I haven't even pushed the button yet.
[05:04.36]Pushing the button now.
[05:04.98]Thanks, Todd, for 500 bits.
[05:06.62]Let's play.
[05:07.22]What is the stupidest way to play this game?
[05:08.95]Watch Frog Edition?
[05:09.89]No, we're going to be doing... We're going to be doing... Co-op stuff.
[05:18.11]Ringing sound?
[05:18.71]Please, God.
[05:19.78]I need a mod.
[05:20.52]Don't hear a ring.
[05:23.28]There's not a loud ring.
[05:24.06]If there's a loud ring, that would be very fucking unhappy.
[05:27.14]Stream fucking sucks.
[05:29.58]Come on.
[05:30.60]Give me a break, guys.
[05:31.36]I just started here on Twitch.television.com.
[05:33.10]Alright, I'm back.
[05:38.78]I didn't even make a Twitter account about this.
[05:41.19]I forgot to make an entire Twitter account about playing Watch Dogs.
[05:45.35]Well, that's like 60,000 people who need to know about this right now.
[05:53.22]Open my stream.
[05:53.76]Do you hear a ringing sound?
[05:54.56]Me?
[05:55.78]You have to see my other monitor right now.
[05:58.16]I've got eight windows on the screen.
[05:59.70]It's like finding a needle in a haystack.
[06:04.08]Are you getting trolled right now?
[06:05.28]Are they trolling?
[06:06.46]Ringing sound in the stream.
[06:07.64]Stream sucks.
[06:09.32]Is that what they're saying right now?
[06:12.02]I'm going to listen to my own stream.
[06:13.72]Just play it back.
[06:14.52]It's an infinite echo.
[06:16.34]I'm going to play this back in my own ears and see if there is a fucking ringing sound.
[06:24.08]Where's my stream?
[06:25.74]Hold on, guys.
[06:29.00]It's fucking Elgato.
[06:30.52]Alright, hold on.
[06:38.43]One minute.
[06:38.91]I can't even, like, watch my own stream.
[06:49.89]Push the play button.
[06:51.11]Push the play button.
[06:52.75]There we go.
[06:53.13]Alright, everyone quiet.
[06:54.43]One minute.
[06:57.79]There's no ringing.
[06:58.43]You guys are fucking assholes.
[07:00.69]There's no ringing.
[07:01.55]At all.
[07:02.09]Zero.
[07:04.95]What the hell?
[07:05.39]You got trolled, man.
[07:06.81]I called it.
[07:08.05]Why would you do that to me?
[07:09.17]Because we're playing like elite hacker watchdogs too.
[07:11.66]They're trying to be as cool and edgy as the characters in this game.
[07:14.34]But you guys know that I already have trouble streaming.
[07:18.34]Insecurities.
[07:22.42]Yeah, we're still waiting for a Talos to kind of set up.
[07:25.40]Oh, you're ready to go?
[07:26.16]I am ready to go.
[07:27.52]My game might be too loud, but I'm ready to go.
[07:29.31]Alright, so... How do you... You want to invite me or Shadow?
[07:35.31]How does this work?
[07:38.45]You invite me in case there's some kind of progress.
[07:42.55]Deal.
[07:42.75]Remember in Far Cry, if you were the host, your game saves and the other guy doesn't.
[07:48.05]Alright, invite to co-op.
[07:50.67]I'm gonna be really sad when I lose this amazing orange truck, though.
[07:57.54]Etalyx, we have to make an Ubisoft club account.
[07:59.10]I already got one!
[07:59.84]Don't you know that I am like the Ubisoft wonder kid?
[08:08.35]I already signed up.
[08:09.69]Honest to goddamn god, man.
[08:11.25]You should have known after Far Cry 4.
[08:13.01]You should have known.
[08:15.35]What is an Ubisoft club account?
[08:17.05]What is that?
[08:17.43]Well, you know, if you get enough points, then you get invited to the secret lounge.
[08:22.21]What the fuck is it?
[08:23.07]But what is it?
[08:23.53]You get like a free drink.
[08:26.47]Well, no.
[08:27.01]Hold on.
[08:28.34]So is it like just a regular Ubisoft account?
[08:31.00]Maybe.
[08:33.28]Just try signing in with your regular Ubisoft account.
[08:37.54]Dude, I'm just going to... Somebody just put a random email in the fucking chat.
[08:40.32]I'm just going to use it.
[08:43.00]No, don't do that.
[08:43.76]Don't do that.
[08:44.16]I'm kidding.
[08:44.56]No.
[08:47.53]Look how small this is.
[08:48.57]Starting soon.
[08:52.02]We haven't started.
[08:52.62]Okay.
[09:03.40]What was my... Let's see.
[09:12.91]Only Ubisoft.
[09:14.17]Not only would they make you have to buy games on Steam and do Uplay, but when you're even in the goddamn game, you are inside of a game on PS4 and you have to still have a Uplay account.
[09:26.35]The layers.
[09:27.15]There's so many layers of login.
[09:29.47]They want to make sure that you're safe.
[09:31.55]It's a game about hacking.
[09:32.41]They want to make sure you have enough passwords to keep yourself safe.
[09:40.36]Please tell me that's it.
[09:42.28]Apparently that does not exist.
[09:43.68]Oh my god.
[09:48.30]I could have like a club penguin account.
[09:52.56]You all thought I wasn't ready.
[09:57.37]I am so ready.
[09:58.39]Please verify my email address.
[10:02.03]I'm starting to get flashbacks.
[10:03.45]I'm getting like Far Cry flashbacks right now.
[10:07.05]I have to verify my actual email now.
[10:09.25]It could be a fake one.
[10:11.31]What if you actually use the guys from chat and you pick the wrong one?
[10:14.93]Then you can't verify it.
[10:22.42]Anybody know my password to my email?
[10:26.38]Somebody just writes it.
[10:27.12]It's a mess of papers here now.
[10:37.57]I hope you guys are enjoying the spring here.
[10:40.11]We're just getting going.
[10:40.85]Alright.
[10:43.28]I really am going to be right back.
[10:45.56]So I'm muting everything.
[10:46.52]I'll be right back in like two seconds.
[10:47.62]I got to go find something.
[13:16.60]Alright, hi.
[13:18.72]Oh, he's back!
[13:21.36]Oh look, here he is!
[13:24.26]I cannot fucking believe that I have to do this.
[13:30.59]Don't you know?
[13:31.25]You're right, I should've learned.
[13:32.63]You should've learned.
[13:34.83]You gotta prepare for the worst.
[13:37.33]Obey your thirst.
[13:41.58]I'm just gonna say I'm like 14, who cares.
[13:57.65]Okay, apparently.
[13:59.75]Okay.
[14:00.95]Alright.
[14:02.13]I need to like run around and punch somebody now.
[14:05.67]Before people start to go, what are you doing?
[14:08.49]What are you doing?
[14:11.91]Are you like logged in through Ubisoft Clubhouse?
[14:14.01]Yeah.
[14:14.87]Yes.
[14:17.11]Let me take a look.
[14:17.95]See?
[14:18.83]Online co-op.
[14:19.73]There you are.
[14:20.15]You're on my friends list.
[14:22.57]Don't you wish you could just invite me to the game?
[14:23.81]That'd be swell.
[14:26.65]I do.
[14:31.78]Yeah, I accept the terms of service.
[14:34.06]You can spy on me.
[14:34.82]The government's going to spy on me now.
[14:38.28]Okay, apparently I'm Jeremy1000.
[14:41.03]Do you see me?
[14:43.29]Game of attention sent.
[14:45.49]Alright, we can play.
[14:55.33]No.
[14:55.99]Alright!
[14:56.51]Look at this!
[14:57.27]Watchdogs!
[14:57.81]Here we go!
[14:58.15]We're gonna play Watchdogs!
[15:02.17]Alright, let me know when you've figured out a new password.
[15:07.45]I sent an info to you.
[15:08.61]An invote?
[15:10.01]I sent an info to you.
[15:11.33]Let me check my invotes.
[15:16.75]I see a checkmark next to your name.
[15:18.63]Is everything alright?
[15:21.32]Did you get his insurance?
[15:23.02]Is that guy dead?
[15:26.90]Alright, I hacked him so bad that he disappeared from the car.
[15:32.54]Get fucking hacked.
[15:34.26]Oh, no, no, no.
[15:34.80]He's just gonna go get, like, a coffee.
[15:41.29]You're gonna get in big trouble, dude.
[15:45.21]Why does he not know what he's doing?
[15:46.69]That's the best part.
[15:48.63]Alright, should I send it to you again?
[15:51.99]Oh, I'm teamed up with the Talos.
[15:58.98]There he is!
[15:59.34]There's a Etalyx!
[16:00.78]Why can't you melee your friends?
[16:02.92]You can't melee your friends?
[16:03.76]Can you shoot your friends?
[16:05.97]Hold on.
[16:07.15]Wait a minute, Ubisoft.
[16:08.19]You're telling me that I cannot stun gun my own friend?
[16:13.41]Unbelievable.
[16:15.87]No friendly fire.
[16:17.69]Two out of ten.
[16:18.91]Alright, no friendly fire.
[16:19.97]Stand still.
[16:22.59]Let's see if there's really friendly fire.
[16:24.07]Who hacked it first?
[16:24.75]Me?
[16:25.75]Who hacked the lock?
[16:28.58]Why was the hardest part of that just opening the door?
[16:34.32]Where are we?
[16:36.18]I see a marker.
[16:36.88]Did you put that marker there?
[16:38.18]No.
[16:39.36]Hold on.
[16:39.96]I need to turn this music down or off.
[16:46.09]How do you hack stuff in this game?
[16:49.99]Wait, what?
[16:53.07]Uh, sorry, we can't have music.
[16:55.03]Oh, yeah, is it copyrighted?
[16:57.39]Oh, it's absolutely copyrighted.
[16:58.65]Oh, boy.
[16:59.75]No music allowed.
[17:00.67]Hold on.
[17:02.73]I see a marker over there.
[17:03.72]I think we're supposed to be going there.
[17:08.48]Turn that radio off.
[17:09.78]That's an armored car.
[17:13.26]That's a police armored car.
[17:15.56]Wait, hold on.
[17:16.22]Coffee.
[17:20.15]Okay, I'm fine.
[17:20.67]Coffee!
[17:21.98]Gotta get a coffee.
[17:23.64]Is it open?
[17:24.28]Can you come in here too?
[17:24.86]Is it open in this hour?
[17:27.06]It is.
[17:29.28]Can I get a free coffee?
[17:31.56]I think I scared him a little bit.
[17:35.55]Excuse me, you're in the way of my coffee.
[17:39.05]Hold on, let me look at it.
[17:40.97]You gonna Instagram that?
[17:42.37]You gonna Instagram a pic of your coffee?
[17:48.42]Thanks for the coffee.
[17:49.71]And here's your tip.
[17:52.69]He's fine.
[17:53.35]He already gave... He's got a gun!
[17:54.77]He's got a gun!
[17:55.57]He's got a... Okay.
[18:00.73]Hey, you want another drink of coffee?
[18:03.02]It's on the house.
[18:04.94]I'm the coffee guy now.
[18:09.74]He punched him in the back of the head and he freaked out.
[18:13.14]That was fun.
[18:14.09]Change weapon.
[18:14.67]I want to use a stun gun.
[18:17.59]Why can't you stun your friend?
[18:20.45]I really don't know.
[18:21.49]You should be able to do a lot of different things in this game that you can't really do.
[18:27.07]We actually have to get out of here.
[18:28.76]Because the police are actually coming?
[18:31.94]Hijack the pizza car.
[18:33.46]Don't worry, I'm going to make it come back to us.
[18:41.54]I want the pizza car.
[18:49.81]Get in!
[18:52.13]Oh.
[18:53.16]Oh, thanks.
[18:53.68]Sorry.
[18:55.34]It's right here.
[18:55.82]The marker or whatever it is is right here.
[19:01.76]Really?
[19:02.70]A bush like that is gonna stop a car?
[19:04.50]Alright, what do we do?
[19:09.29]Let's see what this guy's problem is.
[19:13.31]Recovering alcoholic.
[19:14.35]Okay.
[19:14.57]You know what the handbrake button is?
[19:18.64]Uh, it should be O.
[19:25.83]Yo, you figured it out.
[19:27.05]You figured it out.
[19:28.71]Close enough.
[19:30.37]Alright, how do I use my magical hacking powers in this game?
[19:34.59]How do we activate this mission?
[19:36.09]What is the mission we're supposed to do?
[19:40.72]Can you stand over here?
[19:41.46]What happens if we stand on the same circle?
[19:44.42]Oh, we go to this guy.
[19:46.74]What guy?
[19:47.68]Hit your left, right stick.
[19:50.70]I just did.
[19:51.20]There's like a guy over here.
[19:54.65]Mine is telling me there's a thing we have to do like here.
[19:57.45]Oh, that might be like a single player thing.
[19:59.33]Is there a guy here for you?
[20:01.95]There's no guy there for me.
[20:03.57]There might be a guy there, but I don't think he's a guy that I can use.
[20:08.00]Where's Secretary Jacked John Kerry?
[20:11.66]I mean, which guy is it?
[20:12.42]This one?
[20:12.98]Yeah.
[20:16.16]What are you doing?
[20:16.84]What am I doing?
[20:18.74]Yeah.
[20:19.22]Checking Reddit, you know, front page.
[20:22.44]Did you guys hear a ring?
[20:23.10]I hear a ringing.
[20:28.37]What the hell was that?
[20:29.17]Did you summon, like, the Megatron?
[20:34.31]Why was that a noise that we could both hear?
[20:36.19]What was that?
[20:37.80]Something is fucking electrocuting something.
[20:41.82]Did you say?
[20:42.58]I already did this.
[20:43.24]Did you say electrocuting something?
[20:44.94]Oh, I can't shoot him.
[20:46.06]Yeah, this is like an NPC.
[20:47.36]Okay.
[20:48.36]Wow.
[20:49.86]How about these hula hoopers?
[20:52.36]New mission available.
[20:53.72]On the hunt.
[20:54.20]Alright, let's go.
[20:55.86]You're driving.
[20:56.32]Marcus, Prime 8 got their hands on some of our data.
[20:59.70]Fuck, where are they?
[21:00.60]Fuck.
[21:01.35]What?
[21:02.17]And Marcus, they have someone on their tail.
[21:04.69]I think someone else wants what they know.
[21:06.59]Okay, I'll find something fast and get to them first.
[21:08.27]Alright, go for it.
[21:08.89]Marcus, they're getting away.
[21:09.85]I'll do the hacking.
[21:10.47]We gotta move faster.
[21:11.76]Yo, I'm on it.
[21:13.20]Why are the police here?
[21:15.22]Don't worry.
[21:15.56]I hacked the streetlights.

[21:30.23]We have to go neutralize.
[21:31.09]I'm working on it.
[21:32.32]Hack it.
[21:39.77]We're gonna get this guy.
[21:40.83]Why did you just cause like it?
[21:42.95]Oh my god.
[21:43.95]Oh my god.

[22:07.45]Don't worry.
[22:08.27]It's a game of hackers.
[22:09.15]Who can hack better?
[22:10.57]Me.
[22:13.12]Watch this.
[22:13.84]Hacked it.
[22:17.10]I'm gonna take a little detour here.
[22:19.36]500 meters.
[22:21.56]Don't worry.
[22:21.88]I'm maneuvering.
[22:25.24]Gotta go through, like, the state building.
[22:26.98]No!
[22:27.44]Not that way.
[22:30.90]I'm flanking.
[22:32.93]I'm going over this way.
[22:34.17]I'm gonna try to cut him off on his right side.
[22:37.11]He's so far away.
[22:38.69]He is really far away.
[22:39.95]It's alright, I got like exceptional driving skills.
[22:43.01]Like my driving skills are at least a six out of ten.
[22:44.91]Oh yeah, we're gonna need someone from Behavior to tune that up for us.
[22:50.71]Attack it!
[22:55.65]Now he's this way.
[22:57.94]Shit, he's going the other... Okay, I gotta go back this way apparently.
[23:03.39]I'm gaining.
[23:04.89]I'm killing so many people accidentally.
[23:06.65]It's not even funny.
[23:10.43]Where's he going?
[23:10.89]Alright, I'm gonna get him on my street.
[23:13.65]Here we go.
[23:14.29]There he is.
[23:17.58]No, he went down an alley.
[23:21.34]Hack his car!
[23:22.84]Hack his car!
[23:23.78]Get him!
[23:24.92]Get him!
[23:27.04]Get him!
[23:27.80]Neutralize!
[23:28.14]Neutralize!
[23:29.90]Yeah, we got we got so many Twitter followers well thousand followers for murdering someone.
[23:35.12]It's just the purge It's like the movie the purge Okay, I can't use that car everything's exploding everything exploded
[23:57.97]Um, yeah.
[23:58.97]At least three cars are on fire now.
[24:02.47]Um, seven police officers down the alley.
[24:06.05]That's one way to do it, I guess.
[24:11.32]There's this one guy here.
[24:13.78]This guy who's, like, fixing a hole in the ground.
[24:16.68]What do you mean?
[24:20.33]What?
[24:21.05]Okay.
[24:21.89]What?
[24:22.13]I don't know what that guy was doing, but you ran him over.
[24:25.89]I didn't know that was the guy.
[24:27.27]I was just trying to drive over to you.
[24:30.85]You just killed somebody.
[24:32.61]This guy?
[24:33.05]You just got it.
[24:34.19]Yeah, that guy.
[24:34.97]We have a new mission.
[24:38.27]Get in.
[24:40.73]That's so loud in my ears.
[24:44.59]You see the blipper?
[24:45.39]Marker?
[24:45.55]The blipper.
[24:51.29]You just hit the rice-a-roni car.
[24:53.17]Wait, wait, wait.
[24:54.15]I knocked it off the tracks.
[24:55.75]Hey, rice-a-roni, you're out of shape.
[24:57.81]Just go treat.
[24:59.97]You want to see a yo-yo trick, apparently?
[25:02.27]Why don't we have, like, grenades or any other explosives?
[25:04.98]Why can we not get in here?
[25:05.56]I want to get in the car.
[25:08.28]I can climb on top of it, apparently.
[25:11.26]You, like, knocked it off the rails.
[25:12.78]Who the fuck is this?
[25:15.00]Get out of here.
[25:15.72]Hack him to go backwards.
[25:19.69]Give me some space.
[25:22.83]There's so many of these rice-a-roni cars.
[25:24.79]Oh boy.
[25:31.78]Oh boy.
[25:37.04]Why is there a helicopter here?
[25:43.36]This doesn't even do anything.
[25:47.04]Why are these people trying to get away from me?
[25:50.31]There's a dog?
[25:51.27]There's a fucking attack dog.
[25:53.83]There are so many police officers.
[25:55.88]SWAT team's here.
[25:56.54]Teammate was detected.
[26:00.10]I wish these people would just get off the ride.
[26:02.86]Get off.
[26:05.96]There's a psycho on the loose.
[26:07.24]Why did I earn a trophy?
[26:12.84]I'm here.
[26:15.36]I need a new car, though.
[26:20.91]Do the coughs get off?
[26:22.77]Yeah, they do.
[26:23.45]They're looking for you.
[26:25.89]Well, don't tell them where I am.
[26:27.33]What?
[26:31.06]Do I hear a dog chasing me?
[26:32.26]There is a dog chasing me.
[26:33.12]Yeah, they have attack dogs.
[26:38.26]Okay, I'm in the banana van now.
[26:42.03]I got the banana van.
[26:43.11]I've misspelled twitch.tv so badly.
[26:45.45]twitch.tv.
[26:45.99]twitch.tv.
[26:51.52]Alright, how do I get away?
[26:54.60]I actually don't know.
[26:58.22]That is a very good question.
[27:00.79]Can you hack the choppers eventually, too?
[27:02.21]Uh, I would be surprised if you could.
[27:04.37]If you can hack cars in this game, you can certainly hack a helicopter.
[27:08.57]Hey, uh, thank you, uh, C3Slipball23 for two months.
[27:14.79]98Eclipse for two months.
[27:16.95]Oh, boy.
[27:18.05]Chili!
[27:19.61]ChiliRoseX for 13 months.
[27:21.87]Well, I would have gotten away.
[27:23.33]Also, thank you to Smikey for two months.
[27:28.46]Kuncho.
[27:29.56]Kunicho.
[27:30.34]Kuchino.
[27:30.84]I don't know what to do.
[27:31.96]I'm awful at words.
[27:32.54]The helicopter is never going to leave me alone.
[27:34.04]I think I have the equivalent of five stars.
[27:36.49]Tank Ninjas fed her with Major 598 for eight months.
[27:39.75]Thanks, dude.
[27:40.21]Jeremy, it's been eight months.
[27:41.15]I want to give you a shout-out because you suck at video games and didn't support the Wild West competitive gaming, so I kind of don't know... So I kind of don't want to give you a shout-out.
[27:50.63]Now when I think of it, your jokes are bad, too.
[27:52.59]Try harder.
[27:53.99]Alright, fine.
[27:56.19]I'm about to try harder at Etalyx.
[27:58.93]What, to spell correctly?
[28:00.89]Mm-mm.
[28:02.65]You'll see.
[28:03.93]They're shooting me from the vehicle now.
[28:07.44]That seems like cheating.
[28:09.32]Well, the thing we have to do is right here.
[28:11.46]Yeah, about that thing.
[28:12.70]You want me to try harder?
[28:15.85]Fine.
[28:16.89]Okay.
[28:17.25]There's a little goofy delivery bike here.
[28:20.99]Ready for some funny jokes?
[28:22.89]I'm coming back to you because I cannot escape these guys.
[28:25.36]Period.
[28:28.80]I just die.
[28:30.58]Too much work.
[28:32.66]I don't give up.
[28:36.56]He's crashing the houses.
[28:39.26]This thing is so bad.
[28:45.20]Can you actually get arrested?
[28:50.48]See, I tried harder.
[28:51.34]I just pulled my headset out.
[29:00.85]Comedy gold.
[29:01.77]Yeah, wasn't that funny?
[29:05.10]Alright, meet me at the, uh... I'm currently surrendering to the police.
[29:08.46]Um, I believe they're just gonna choose to shoot me to death.
[29:11.38]Yeah.
[29:13.86]What was that explosion?
[29:15.52]Some guy just goes, Christ!
[29:20.42]That's his reaction.
[29:21.96]Christ!
[29:24.36]Who is... Okay, the guy finally shut up.
[29:32.88]The police are going after you again.
[29:36.51]You're dead again.
[29:37.09]What happens to you?
[29:40.23]I just keep seeing the kill feed.
[29:43.57]Alright, I'm ready.
[29:44.39]I'm ready to live this time.
[29:47.73]Also, thank you to Twisted Lobster for seven months.
[29:50.87]Tomato Sauce, Human Mail, thank you guys for your subscriptions.
[29:55.59]Very much appreciate it.
[29:57.31]Yeah, I'm standing here.
[29:57.85]I'm just waiting for you.
[29:58.49]We have a blip.
[30:03.02]Christ.
[30:08.83]I'm just burning this lady's phone.
[30:16.02]I'm here.
[30:23.32]Quick, light her phone on fire.
[30:24.64]Look, I'm gonna burn his phone.
[30:31.38]Is the phone being burnt on his skull?
[30:33.27]I don't get it.
[30:35.36]How do you burn his phone?
[30:36.10]It's really hot.
[30:38.47]Something does... Is he still alive?
[30:40.37]Why is he just twitching on the ground?
[30:43.35]Because I lit his phone on fire.
[30:49.81]I'm starting to say, like, deceased.
[30:52.02]I don't think they're dead.
[30:53.22]I think they're still alive.
[30:54.82]But they are now!
[30:56.90]Oh my god, he really is.
[30:57.96]Holy shit, that was terrible.
[30:59.66]Now he's dead.
[31:01.30]The other one, I don't know.
[31:02.18]The other one might be dead.
[31:03.02]Alright, pretend you just didn't see that.
[31:04.22]We gotta run away or else we're gonna get infinitely chased by the cops again.
[31:07.54]I don't feel good about that.
[31:08.72]I needed to see what was going on though.
[31:10.70]How do you get more hacker points?
[31:14.60]That was a sweet flip.
[31:17.72]That was a nice night elf move.
[31:18.98]Is this guy just giving us his car?
[31:26.31]Yeah, he is.
[31:27.59]You're gonna have it!
[31:30.19]Where is he going?
[31:37.23]He wasn't even trying to do that to you.
[31:40.81]How do you control people's cars?
[31:42.93]It's one of the things you unlock in the tree.
[31:46.97]I need more super hacker points, though.
[31:52.09]Are we getting actual money for this or not?
[31:55.15]Yeah, I think they PayPal it to you through your Ubisoft Club account.
[32:03.28]My navigator is supposed to be giving me directions with a blip and a marker so I can see where I'm going.
[32:09.27]Oh, me?
[32:09.67]It's really far away.
[32:11.13]Why don't you just assume this works like Grand Theft Auto?
[32:13.67]How do you know it's going to do it for both of you?
[32:15.50]I know it does.
[32:18.14]Oh, I'm just causing traffic accidents.
[32:22.94]I'm stealing everyone's money as we drive by them.
[32:25.99]This is 2,000 meters away.
[32:29.83]What the fuck was that guy on?
[32:33.07]Was that guy just floating?
[32:36.57]It wouldn't be the first time one of the vehicles was invisible in a Ubisoft game.
[32:42.47]Come on.
[32:43.71]Come on!
[32:44.58]No!
[32:49.98]And your mother.
[32:50.66]No, really.
[32:50.86]Yeah, we'll eat that.
[32:53.73]Well, we lost the guy that was floating.
[32:59.39]Can we even tell what this mission is supposed to be?
[33:02.31]Do you have any idea?
[33:07.53]No, it's probably going to be... Well, we have to get on the bike.
[33:12.16]Pretty easy.
[33:13.88]I broke that girl's back in like 18 different places.
[33:18.30]I feel like it would be faster for me to drive to the bike, honestly.
[33:25.90]You made it to the bike.
[33:26.74]I did.
[33:28.21]It appears to be a single-seater.
[33:31.17]Single only?
[33:31.87]Yeah.
[33:32.99]Wow, Ubisoft.
[33:34.41]Not going to let two people ride a bike in co-op mode?
[33:36.85]Probably like a two-seater bike.
[33:38.35]There has to be.
[33:38.85]I'm going to be flying.
[33:45.83]Etalyx is streaming as well, yes.
[33:49.27]Check out his stream.
[33:49.95]twitch.tv.
[33:51.03]Splash?
[33:52.85]What is Etalyx?
[33:53.89]It is Etalyx.
[33:55.89]This might be a two-seater.
[33:58.80]Check this one.
[34:05.90]Get back here.
[34:11.89]How are you still on this bike?
[34:15.51]This looks like it's bigger.
[34:16.37]Oh!
[34:18.80]You know, I was actually not trying to hit you.
[34:20.87]It sounds like I was underwater.
[34:24.53]I swerved to the left of you, and you still got hit.
[34:31.07]He's inside of you right now.
[34:33.57]He's inside of me?
[34:34.49]Who is?
[34:34.83]The guy.
[34:35.21]He's just jogging in you.
[34:37.54]Yeah, he's still there.
[34:39.46]Is the guy inside of you?
[34:40.36]Yeah, he's inside of you right now.
[34:42.60]Alright, well what happens if I do this?
[34:44.94]I can't even turn my camera fast enough.
[34:47.16]He's still there.
[34:47.92]You have a new yeah buddy.
[34:49.54]He's on the bike with you.
[34:52.30]He really is just like attached to me, isn't he?
[34:54.90]Yeah.
[34:55.24]What is he doing?
[34:56.30]I don't know.
[34:56.76]Hold on.
[35:01.34]This is for science purposes.
[35:02.60]I'm trying to get on the bike, not the bus.
[35:05.08]Okay.
[35:06.52]So if I just go very fast, is he going to go very fast too?
[35:12.28]Come on.
[35:13.26]Get back inside the bike.
[35:13.84]There's only one way to find out.
[35:18.01]Oh, I think he ditched him.
[35:19.11]He's not following me anymore.
[35:20.25]I think he left him.
[35:22.61]Oh, well.
[35:23.53]That means he has to die.
[35:28.49]That's a police officer.
[35:29.51]Be very careful.
[35:31.37]Try to, like, get him reattached.
[35:32.59]See if I can hack him to be attached.
[35:36.53]Here, watch out.
[35:37.31]What happened to your phone, dude?
[35:39.85]No, that's not my fault.
[35:42.84]This guy's phone is on fire and is not even hurting him.
[35:47.08]I go, we have to take this guy with us.
[35:49.80]It's not my fault, officers.
[35:52.24]This guy does not feel pain.
[35:54.08]Oh, dear.
[35:54.48]I'm going to die.
[35:59.97]Yeah, I can't even target him.
[36:01.13]I can't even hit him.
[36:04.73]What are we doing with this guy?
[36:06.91]Which guy?
[36:07.39]Hang on.
[36:08.61]I may have attracted a little attention.
[36:11.49]That guy?
[36:12.09]The Jeep just fucking crushed.
[36:14.75]That guy?
[36:15.35]He looks like he's fine to me.
[36:18.87]What are you doing here?
[36:20.14]But we might have another problem on our hands.
[36:22.78]I couldn't do anything to that guy.
[36:31.89]What did you get this car?
[36:34.03]What, this Jeep?
[36:36.21]I had to pick it up because the cops were blasting me.
[36:40.15]Oh, watch out for those cops.
[36:43.13]They yell so loudly.
[36:49.08]They are way faster than my Jeep.
[36:53.10]Grand Cherokee Liberty.
[36:55.42]I want a better motorcycle.
[36:56.54]That one's better.
[36:57.00]What are these police officers doing?
[37:03.50]Did you see that?
[37:07.48]Okay, if there was a noise that would ever explain what I just saw it was Alright, I'm almost at the mission I'm here Oh boy, I'm gonna be coming in hot Coming in hot!
[37:26.73]That was funny, that was a thumbs up, funny
[37:34.63]Where's my bike?
[37:36.39]How do we actually start this?
[37:39.17]I don't know.
[37:39.62]I think I have to be over there, but I want the bike.
[37:42.24]Don't get killed in your Jurassic Park vehicle.
[37:48.16]This is so loud in my head.
[37:49.44]Why can I not drive this thing?
[37:52.62]Hey, I'm just going to push circle to hide in the car.
[37:54.56]They'll never know.
[37:55.42]I'm here.
[37:56.76]We made it.
[37:57.16]Alright.
[37:57.60]Well, then what?
[37:59.43]Teammate was detected.
[38:00.60]I'm right there.
[38:02.14]Yeah.
[38:03.20]I don't know.
[38:03.62]I haven't figured it out yet.
[38:05.98]I'm not entirely sure.
[38:06.58]How do you play Watch Dogs?
[38:09.54]Maybe we can't be chased by police.
[38:11.30]This guy can't control the car.
[38:13.95]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[38:16.57]I can't control the car!
[38:19.37]It's almost like there's some kind of hacker around us!
[38:28.00]Okay.
[38:29.14]Um, I would help you, but I'll just take their money instead.
[38:32.49]I need help.
[38:34.05]Here comes a fucking helicopter, too.
[38:35.51]This is great.
[38:37.97]You are so dead.
[38:41.25]I will be shortly.
[38:42.13]Alright, I'm waiting for this guy to get some position and I'm going to run him over.
[38:49.40]I am so dead.
[38:50.06]That was great.
[38:50.84]That didn't work.
[38:58.99]How are you taking on this many people?
[39:00.43]I don't understand.
[39:02.22]I'm trying really hard.
[39:04.22]Shouldn't you not be able to do this?
[39:09.86]You're going to have to drive around.
[39:11.82]I don't think we can have... I don't think we can have... Can I make that thing drive around?
[39:19.55]I think I've dealt with all currently present police officers except for the SWAT team.
[39:23.65]There's now this one.
[39:24.93]I'm dead.
[39:26.17]I'm dead.
[39:26.45]I tried.
[39:27.31]I tried.
[39:32.51]Alright, I think we're good.
[39:37.74]No, no, no.
[39:38.70]I stood on his car.
[39:39.60]I stood on the guy's car.
[39:45.24]Those stupid yo-yo moves.
[39:48.12]Okay, so now we're both dead.
[39:52.34]Yes, we should no longer have police on us.
[39:55.51]Oh no, I picked up one of their guns and then they instantly killed me.
[40:00.20]Don't pick up the gun.
[40:01.36]Todd, why would I play this game?
[40:02.42]Well, thanks for the $500.
[40:04.44]Why would I play this game instead of GTA Online?
[40:06.29]Because in this game, you can hack.
[40:09.57]Oh, it's new.
[40:10.33]Figured we'd give it a try for tonight.
[40:14.65]Alright, I figured it out.
[40:16.97]You figured it out?
[40:18.77]Start mission.
[40:22.16]You have to be outside of the vehicle.
[40:24.78]Well, that guy was just aiming his gun at you.
[40:27.70]Maybe we got away just in time.
[40:31.66]Operations with higher diff... Take a picture of a player downloading data.
[40:37.45]What?
[40:38.59]Um... Somebody left this police car for us, I guess.
[40:43.83]Ah, that's very nice of them.
[40:45.27]Still have to hijack it.
[40:46.55]Apparently they locked their doors.
[40:49.69]Hey, let's lock our police car and then leave it in the middle of the road.
[40:52.73]With the lights still on, of course.
[40:55.61]Turn them off.
[40:58.74]There.
[41:01.70]Easy.
[41:03.97]Easy.
[41:04.41]Not in the water.
[41:05.15]Easy.
[41:05.47]Hold on.
[41:06.03]Crowd of people.
[41:06.87]Do you miss the crowd of people we could mess with?
[41:09.47]Don't you know?
[41:10.89]No, no, no, no, no.
[41:12.43]What are you doing?
[41:13.64]What?
[41:15.66]Okay.
[41:17.36]Okay.
[41:18.90]That crowd of people?
[41:20.32]Or this crowd of people?
[41:22.26]Uh, the crowd of people that didn't- that you did not even- you ghosted through them.
[41:25.12]This one is unfazed by the car that just careened off into the river.
[41:28.72]Alright, fuck those people.
[41:29.92]The guys that are enjoying a drink together.
[41:31.84]These guys are just wearing suspenders.
[41:33.63]How is that- Go get a boat.
[41:36.55]Go get that boat over there.
[41:37.85]Go get a boat.
[41:38.59]Drive it right into these guys.
[41:41.43]How am I gonna hit those guys- No!
[41:42.95]You just made him get up!
[41:44.13]No.
[41:46.17]They're fine.
[41:47.33]Look, you can't drive up there anyway.
[41:49.88]There you can.
[41:50.62]Off the rock.
[41:52.34]See the rock right there?
[41:52.96]You can just, like, kind of... That guy's fine.
[41:55.60]Plus, this is not a good target.
[41:57.79]There's better targets.
[41:59.25]I'll show you.
[41:59.69]You sure about that?
[42:00.41]Yeah.
[42:00.99]What about the guy sitting over there?
[42:05.53]So we're not doing this guy, we're not targeting this guy.
[42:07.77]Look, it's much easier to ramp over the rocks.
[42:10.73]I'm about to press circle, you gotta tell me yes or no.
[42:13.18]Circle on what?
[42:13.86]No, hit him!
[42:15.26]Okay, hey, well... Do whatever you want!
[42:17.54]That problem has been solved.
[42:18.52]Knock yourself out!
[42:22.76]Oh, let me take a picture.
[42:23.46]How do I pull up my camera phone?
[42:26.82]Oh, what happened?
[42:30.72]Dude just taken a selfie with a girl I just kicked in the back of the fucking head.
[42:36.67]What are you doing?
[42:38.13]Me?
[42:39.75]What's going on?
[42:40.11]This guy is really upset with me.
[42:42.73]Because I guess this is his boat?
[42:45.55]This might be his boat.
[42:48.31]Get it.
[42:49.37]He's telling me I don't belong here.
[42:50.69]You guys are just... Hold on.
[42:53.27]Let me take a... How do I take a picture?
[42:56.65]Why do I... Hang on.
[42:57.81]How do you do that?
[42:59.06]Just hanging out at the dock.
[43:06.29]12,000 followers.
[43:06.65]Is that really as far as you can zoom in?
[43:11.35]I'm trying to do like a gesture.
[43:18.98]You can actually walk with it.
[43:20.10]Okay.
[43:20.98]This is why this is better than GTA.
[43:23.38]I can walk with the camera out facing me.
[43:25.86]Please drive a fucking boat behind me so I can take a picture right when it hits me.
[43:32.29]Yeah, you gotta come up.
[43:33.11]You gotta hit me with the bolt, dude.
[43:34.89]I might be bringing a friend.
[43:36.01]Maybe not.
[43:37.29]That's okay.
[43:38.15]These guys are all armed on the dock, by the way.
[43:40.40]Every single one of them.
[43:41.26]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[43:41.88]Don't come.
[43:42.14]Don't come.
[43:42.38]Don't, don't, don't, don't.
[43:43.96]I gotta build some speed first.
[43:46.56]That's not the camera.
[43:49.00]Reinforcements have been called.
[43:54.32]Alright, here we go.
[43:55.26]Well, um... Oh, cool.
[43:57.02]Look at your super cool bolt, man.
[43:58.23]Currently taking some small arms fire.
[43:59.79]Am I clear for takeoff?

[44:04.62]Getting ready to take a snapper selfie!
[44:10.21]You fucking missed.
[44:11.29]It's harder to see it than it looks.
[44:15.95]It's harder to see it than it looks, okay?
[44:21.40]I just hear people shooting guns at you.
[44:26.58]The science.
[44:31.79]What I told you you can't ramp up there here like swing over the side go go over this way like to your right Like here like over here But what about right here where this lady is is having a peaceful fishing can I do it in the water?

[45:11.07]Look.
[45:11.69]Where these guys are like pacing around back and forth.
[45:14.53]Okay, fine.
[45:15.77]This is fucking stupid.
[45:18.33]This is like a dumb joke.
[45:21.30]There's a war going on right now.
[45:22.60]The sons of Ragnarok have engaged you.
[45:25.48]Wait, the sons of Ragnarok?
[45:27.90]Is that this boat that I stole?
[45:29.22]Yeah, they're having a war over here.
[45:34.04]This guy's shooting at this car.
[45:35.38]They're sending their attack dogs.
[45:36.14]Where do you want me?
[45:37.34]Just, like, where I can get up on the shore, like, to your right.
[45:41.18]Go to your right.
[45:43.76]Where this lady is.
[45:46.31]Yeah, this lady's right here.
[45:47.95]Alright, hold on.
[45:48.43]Let me get my camera ready.
[45:50.68]This lady is like, something's wrong with this lady.
[45:52.46]She's picking up seashells.
[45:53.50]Alright, we're ready for you.
[45:57.24]No, go to the other one.
[45:59.12]There's another short.
[45:59.96]Why is this?
[46:00.98]No, you have to try this one.
[46:02.05]This is the lady here picking up seashells.
[46:03.49]Alright, let me build up some speed.
[46:04.49]She's posing for my camera.
[46:07.23]Can't really build up that much speed right now, you know?
[46:10.95]See?
[46:11.25]There's not enough speed.
[46:13.37]And now I'm stuck.
[46:15.50]Oh, jeez.
[46:16.68]It was so close.
[46:19.08]Oh, it was so close.
[46:22.89]You're asking for trouble.
[46:25.55]Alright, well, fuck.
[46:26.31]Make it double.
[46:27.19]Hold on.
[46:27.55]I got an idea.
[46:28.31]I'll fix you.
[46:28.73]I got an idea.
[46:32.56]Just push it off.
[46:33.18]Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
[46:34.10]Yeah, one of the cars.
[46:38.60]Fighting the sons of Ragnaros.
[46:40.68]Yeah, there's a gang war going on over here.
[46:48.11]I love that you can move around with this.
[46:49.75]That makes it so much more fun.
[46:50.95]Uh-oh.
[46:53.12]Don't, don't dump it.
[46:54.06]Uh oh.
[46:57.56]Oh boy.
[46:59.50]Yeah, just like chillin' at the pier.
[47:01.20]Hold on a second.
[47:03.74]I was at the pier today, man, and this crazy guy, dude, I swear to God, this guy's nuts.
[47:08.08]Look at this dude.
[47:09.84]Fucking look at my gun.
[47:11.94]Look at my gun, yeah.
[47:14.12]He was supposed to hit me.
[47:16.34]Oh, he's pushing the boat.
[47:19.66]It's smokin' now, but it still works.
[47:22.53]What did you get for not throwing the funny joke?
[47:37.70]Okay, I'm in the water.
[47:38.82]You're way down there.
[47:41.19]I'm in the water on my phone.
[47:44.51]How do you get down there?
[47:46.45]Wait, wait, wait.
[47:47.05]Can I get in the car?
[47:48.63]Please let me get in the car in the water.
[47:54.91]How is that even happening?
[48:02.20]I can't get in the car under here.
[48:03.88]How are you just running around?
[48:07.98]Today, guys, it was crazy at the pier.
[48:11.02]A guy hit me with his car.
[48:13.49]It was fucked.
[48:15.91]How the fuck did that happen?
[48:18.95]Why did the car fall in?
[48:24.59]It's just floating.
[48:25.31]I'm bringing reinforcement back up for you.
[48:31.96]Okay, hold on a second.
[48:35.50]Drop another car down here.
[48:37.22]Drop another one?
[48:40.56]Okay.
[48:41.42]Drop another car down here.
[48:45.38]Hold on.
[48:45.60]I got another idea.
[48:46.44]Get out of the car.
[48:52.96]Oh, wait for it.
[48:55.55]Where are you?
[48:56.13]Coming.
[48:56.75]On my way.
[48:59.35]Oh, you're gonna throw a bike down here?
[49:04.91]There it comes.
[49:05.61]Oh, look, a motorcycle.
[49:10.06]I've always wanted one.
[49:13.50]I've always wanted a motorcycle.
[49:15.10]Ah, it didn't hit me.
[49:16.98]You gotta drop a fucking train on me.
[49:21.24]What else?
[49:21.60]Hold on, let me just investigate for a second here.
[49:26.04]Oh, hey, remember those guys?
[49:28.39]The guy?
[49:28.77]Remember those guys that you were having trouble with up here?
[49:30.61]Like, well, I'm about to get rid of them.
[49:35.15]Are they just underwater with you?
[49:37.27]Yeah.
[49:37.93]No, I can just walk underneath the whole world.
[49:41.00]Why did that guy just fall off the ledge?
[49:44.26]This is so interesting.
[49:45.24]I don't give a shit about the Sons of Ragnarok.
[49:52.58]We're in like no man's land right now.
[49:54.72]It only took half an hour to break the game.
[49:56.66]Is that a new record?
[50:00.57]It's got to be a record.
[50:05.37]Well, here's the thing.
[50:08.33]I got to the point where Minecraft doesn't load the chunks anymore.
[50:12.67]Hold on.
[50:16.07]I think I know why.
[50:22.81]Raven's Cry re-release.
[50:27.81]Come over here and explain to me why I can't see this.
[50:33.85]I wish I could drive.
[50:35.47]So badly.
[50:37.86]Actually, I can make it drive.
[50:40.76]Why is that van still making noises?
[50:43.72]Because I'm making it drive.
[50:45.28]Can I steal money from your account?
[50:47.92]I would hope not.
[50:51.64]Tell me what I do over here.
[50:55.91]You're so much faster than me because I have to swim everywhere.
[50:58.30]Should I hurl myself over?
[51:02.62]I can't see a single difference.
[51:04.78]It's just the same water to me.
[51:06.64]Alright, well, keep watching.
[51:08.47]Okay.
[51:08.79]Because this might end up making things a little more interesting.
[51:13.55]See ya.
[51:16.53]You're still falling!
[51:18.13]Wait, are you swimming now?
[51:21.73]What's happening?
[51:22.99]I just see your character model like turning abruptly back and forth.
[51:26.17]I've become a statue.
[51:30.26]Help me!
[51:31.46]Help me!
[51:32.82]What?
[51:33.06]I can't move.
[51:36.24]Hold on.
[51:37.00]Let me get a selfie of this.
[51:37.84]I can't even see you anymore.
[51:39.90]Let me get a selfie of this.
[51:41.70]How far down are you?
[51:45.30]I'm gonna get the rescue boat.
[51:47.80]Got the rescue boat.
[51:49.61]You're piling shit in here until I can get rescued.
[51:55.05]Yeah, you gotta protect the hack statue.
[51:58.16]All I can do is look in different directions.
[52:04.20]Game actually sucks.
[52:08.69]I can't even see where you are.
[52:11.61]Can you walk over?
[52:12.27]It looks like there's sand right here.
[52:14.09]Can you, like, get over here?
[52:15.79]Uh, no.
[52:16.87]No way.
[52:17.43]Hold on.
[52:17.97]I'll be back.
[52:19.95]Give me a moment.
[52:22.13]Alright, I'll give you a moment.
[52:24.15]Gotta collect my things.
[52:27.21]There's nothing... I can't... I really can't do anything.
[52:28.98]What pose is this?
[52:29.86]This is like I was skydiving at first.
[52:33.10]And now I'm... It's like holding two spoons.
[52:40.84]Alright, the sons of... Are you gonna bring the sons of Ragnarok over here?
[52:43.55]May make this out alive.
[52:44.61]I don't know.
[52:45.99]Yeah, you gotta get that boat.
[52:50.82]Yeah.
[52:51.46]I got the rescue boat.
[52:52.08]Have we taken a picture of a player downloading data yet?
[52:55.68]Luckily, there's no timer on that mission.
[52:59.75]Alright.
[53:00.01]I got the rescue boat.
[53:02.83]Your character is just teleporting.
[53:05.87]You got to come a little bit further forward.
[53:08.21]No, your character is actually just teleporting.
[53:11.28]Somebody has to kill me.
[53:14.65]Alright, a little bit to your right.
[53:17.23]Like, you gotta be more to your right.
[53:18.73]Unfortunately, this is not a hovercraft, so it's a little difficult to maneuver directly right and left.
[53:24.15]Like that.
[53:26.06]Is there anything else I can, like, do?
[53:28.24]Are you stuck?
[53:30.04]Oh, I'm stuck completely.
[53:32.76]Driver of San Francisco.
[53:35.46]I can't use that.
[53:37.56]Maps.
[53:41.12]I can't fast travel.
[53:43.48]Well, I'm here.
[53:44.42]I mean, I can't really do anything, but... Can you, like, shoot?
[53:48.59]No, you can't shoot me.
[53:49.51]I've got a machine gun.
[53:50.47]Alright, can you get a car?
[53:52.91]You're in the middle of the ocean.
[53:54.85]Fuck.
[53:56.54]I would have to create a line of boats and then drive the car over those boats to get to you.
[54:01.12]This is such an opportunity, though.
[54:02.86]Like, what do we do with this opportunity?
[54:04.46]When are we going to get this again?
[54:05.40]It's raining underwater.
[54:08.27]Are you, like, stuck?
[54:10.25]I cannot move.
[54:11.19]You can't make it back up that ledge that you jumped down?
[54:15.07]No.
[54:15.99]I'm locked in completely.
[54:17.09]Wait, what about a camera?
[54:17.85]Can I, like, fucking hack my brain into a camera and, like, hop consciousness?
[54:23.89]Nope.
[54:24.23]All I can do is swivel around.
[54:27.43]Can you, like, blow the boat up?
[54:29.55]I mean, that's kind of what I was... Alright, here's what you're going to do.
[54:32.09]Get the bow, you're going to move it in the perfect position.
[54:34.25]Open my stream.
[54:34.85]I'm not even kidding.
[54:35.39]So I can, like, watch?
[54:36.41]You've got to play the claw game.
[54:38.15]No, because you're going to play the claw game.
[54:40.21]And you're going to drop that right on top of me.
[54:41.93]Alright, well, if I drop it, can you just move under it?
[54:44.08]You can't move at all.
[54:45.30]No, I can't move.
[54:45.96]You have to drop that.
[54:46.96]You're playing the claw machine or, like, Plinko or something.
[54:49.50]If I was going to guess, I think I'm directly above you right now.
[54:52.36]You absolutely are not.
[54:53.52]Oh, so I need to go left.
[54:55.42]No, you gotta go forward.
[54:56.44]Forward?
[54:57.34]Yeah, you gotta go forward.
[54:58.81]Here's the problem.
[54:59.33]You cannot look down.
[55:00.61]You can't look straight down.
[55:02.47]I can look straight up, and I'm guaranteeing you that you're not right above me.
[55:07.59]You gotta go forward, like, at least, like, five more feet.
[55:10.27]At least.
[55:11.93]Okay.
[55:12.03]And then you might be close.
[55:13.35]Alright, alright, alright.
[55:16.16]Hold on.
[55:18.12]You know how when you look in the mirror, you look in the side of the machine?
[55:22.80]Okay.
[55:23.66]I think you're in a good spot right now.
[55:25.70]I'm not gonna lie.
[55:26.32]I think this is it, because when I turn all directions, you're still underneath me.
[55:30.52]I don't know.
[55:31.06]You might be a little too high, but my head is... I don't know.
[55:34.52]You might just go right by me.
[55:37.76]Use the map?
[55:38.86]Does the map actually... Okay.
[55:40.28]That's a good idea.
[55:41.08]Exactly.
[55:42.78]So you align yourself up exactly with that map.
[55:46.26]Oh, boy.
[55:46.72]Oh, boy.
[55:48.67]Oh, you know, you could just try it and then go get another boat.
[55:50.83]Except there's an advertisement over my mini-map.
[55:53.27]Okay.
[55:56.45]Try it and then get another one.
[55:57.87]Go get another boat.
[56:00.88]You gotta line up exactly with the map.
[56:02.68]Look, I am lined up exactly with the map.
[56:05.32]We're good.
[56:06.68]This is as lined up as it gets.
[56:08.02]Okay, now you gotta blow the boat up.
[56:10.16]Oh, boy.
[56:10.92]And hope it doesn't move.
[56:12.55]Hold on.
[56:14.47]And I gotta get in a good position to see this.
[56:18.25]Where was like a gas tank?
[56:19.79]I think we're doing some work.
[56:22.33]Hold on.
[56:23.19]Are you guys ready for the payoff?
[56:24.25]Here it comes.
[56:24.79]It's going to end up with me blowing myself up, but I guess that's just par for the course.
[56:29.27]It's par for the course.
[56:34.26]Anytime now.
[56:36.68]Guys, look at me really hacking right now.
[56:40.36]We're on the fourth magazine.
[56:41.80]I hope I have enough ammo to blow up a boat.
[56:47.08]It's five magazines down.
[56:48.46]It's okay.
[56:51.29]I got 200 more rounds.
[56:53.39]It's smoking.
[56:54.35]It's black smoking.
[56:56.01]It is absolutely smoking.
[57:00.62]I need to play more.
[57:01.46]I need to play like single player campaign so I get C4 and grenades.
[57:05.78]Come on.
[57:07.76]Come on.
[57:09.86]It's gonna work.
[57:10.84]It's gonna be paying off.
[57:11.50]It'll be worth it.
[57:11.98]It started smoking after the second magazine.
[57:13.65]We're on like the eighth magazine now.
[57:16.58]Just so you know.
[57:19.52]Ugh, come on.
[57:21.36]Drop that thing through the void and clip me in the head to free me from this.
[57:24.14]I've got 30 more bullets.
[57:26.58]Is that thing not gonna fucking blow?
[57:30.26]Can you, like, hack it to blow it up?
[57:31.24]I'm out of bullets.
[57:32.02]I'm out of bullets.
[57:32.60]No, fuck.
[57:33.45]Alright, I gotta swim.
[57:35.09]I'll be back.
[57:37.07]Go get, like, a grenade.
[57:39.83]Are you, like, attract the police to me, steal their guns, and then come back?
[57:45.19]So much work!
[57:47.69]This will be worth it guys.
[57:48.91]I promise this is gonna be worth it is this there's an explosive thing over here But I don't think there's any way to pick it up like I'm not kidding guys.
[57:55.99]I don't care if this takes like four hours This this is a clip that I need to have So we might be here for a little while But thank you female Jesus and the diabetles for a thousand Oh, no, sorry a hundred was diabetles, but female Jesus was about somebody else gave a thousand.
[58:14.11]Who was it?
[58:15.19]Oh, cuz see ik
[58:17.83]I don't know.
[58:20.35]I was trying to take a selfie and he ran me over.
[58:25.12]The boat's going to despawn?
[58:27.12]Oh, shit.
[58:27.54]It really might.

[58:43.23]This is Spyro.
[58:45.07]A dreamer, dayoi, and cheeseburger.
[58:47.63]I have no idea.

[58:58.06]Play a frog game while he gets a grenade.
[58:59.66]Alright, coming back.
[59:01.43]I've got shotgun ammo, so we're gonna try the shotgun.
[59:04.57]You have another boat!
[59:07.11]Um, just hit an invisible wall?
[59:09.45]You got a nice backup boat.
[59:10.83]I got a backup boat.
[59:11.73]This one looks a little meatier.
[59:12.59]Why isn't it changing color?
[59:13.51]Alright, shotgun the hell out of this thing.
[59:20.12]Can you do it from the other boat so you don't, like, explode?
[59:25.00]um hope that thing's still lined up right yeah I mean I haven't moved it alright what are you what are you doing right now I'm just shooting the boat with a shotgun and nothing is happening you're shooting this boat with a shotgun after 300 rounds uh shoot uh something's not going something going wrong here can boats explode in watchdogs that's a good question I don't know
[59:47.60]Well, on my screen, you were just jumping up and down.
[59:51.58]Well, I'm just... Alright, it's time for you to die.
[59:54.67]We tried.
[59:55.39]We gave it our best effort.
[59:56.31]It's not going to work.
[59:57.35]Hold on.
[59:59.71]What the?
[60:01.31]Did you do that?
[60:01.89]That kind of freaked me out, actually.
[60:05.16]I thought you were ghost driving it.
[60:08.52]The last thing that you can do is potentially is to get, like, six stars on you.
[60:12.64]And just drag them over here and see what happens.
[60:13.96]And then get on the boat from there?
[60:15.76]Just get on the boat.
[60:16.34]Okay.
[60:17.28]Alright.
[60:18.18]It's worth the effort.
[60:20.15]It's worth the effort, it is.
[60:21.23]We'll be here for a while, don't worry.
[60:22.85]Now, I have, like, a giant thing that explodes, but I can't transport this to a vehicle.
[60:27.89]I wish that we had grenades right now and you could just throw one down here.
[60:31.97]Yeah, like, game theory.
[60:33.05]Boats can't explode in Watchdog.
[60:35.71]I wish there was something else I could do.
[60:37.30]Yeah.
[60:38.54]You're just stuck there.
[60:39.30]Alright.
[60:40.02]Pedestrians, you gotta go.
[60:42.10]It's for science.
[60:43.10]Just go on a rampage.
[60:45.78]And get the police in here.
[60:48.59]Ghost driving.
[60:49.39]I don't think anybody saw that.
[60:51.63]Okay, well, we are going to blow this up.
[60:54.91]Thanks a lot, Hydraulic.
[60:56.29]Hydra Hydraulic.
[60:58.13]I'll just read subs for right now.
[61:00.62]I'll just do a sub reading at the moment.
[61:03.92]Imperial Soul.
[61:06.21]I'm, like, burping it by mouth.
[61:07.35]AMG Halo Freak.
[61:08.81]Frozen Crasen Tuna.

[61:18.55]Chili Rose.
[61:19.23]Yeah, that's where I saw.
[61:20.19]That's where I saw the last guy.
[61:23.53]Really enjoy open world games that were made in two years.
[61:25.71]The effort on them is super... Well, to be fair, it's... I don't think they tried to do this.
[61:33.35]What the hell was that?
[61:37.30]What the hell did I get into?
[61:38.64]It's like random people just joining these streams being like, what the hell is going on?
[61:43.70]Well, for those of you that just got here, I took a selfie in front of him running me into the water.
[61:49.74]And this happened.
[61:50.68]I was underneath the Earth.
[61:52.23]And then I fell off another Minecraft chunk layer.
[61:56.03]And this is the end result.
[61:57.55]I can just see you down there fighting.
[61:59.95]Alright, get in the water.
[62:01.31]Get in the water.
[62:02.67]We gotta go.
[62:03.83]I died.
[62:05.07]You died.
[62:05.55]Okay, well hopefully you spawn on me.
[62:07.27]I got 15 seconds of observing.
[62:11.69]You look very peaceful down there, by the way.
[62:14.11]Alright, let's see what happens to you.
[62:15.51]You've got your arms in this weird crisscross position.
[62:19.31]So you're about to respawn.
[62:23.27]Where is it gonna respawn me?
[62:25.71]I have no idea.
[62:28.03]Where are you?
[62:29.21]Okay.
[62:31.40]No, you're back there.
[62:33.04]Alright, I have to, like, leave the game.
[62:34.92]Alright, multiplayer.
[62:40.48]How do I, like, get out of the game?
[62:44.74]Like, our multiplayer session.
[62:48.39]Oh, disconnect.
[62:48.93]Okay.
[62:50.19]Uh, yeah.
[62:50.61]Disconnect.
[62:51.17]Confirm.
[62:52.15]Here we go.
[62:52.63]Let's get out of here.
[62:53.83]Etalyx is left to set.
[62:54.73]I'm still here.
[62:55.31]It doesn't matter.
[62:58.35]It doesn't matter.
[62:59.09]It's still here.
[63:02.46]Okay, well I have to like go to the main menu apparently Disconnecting you doesn't do anything Game options Quit mission Alright, we should be back to normal now I just quit the mission Let's get back into this
[63:33.84]Dead sack.
[63:34.86]Yeah.
[63:35.60]Hackers.
[63:38.32]Alright.
[63:38.98]I'll invite you again.
[63:40.30]I'm not very good at going on rampages.
[63:42.82]I'm not very good at it.
[63:45.94]Wait.
[63:46.87]What's wrong with you?
[63:47.95]Invite to go.
[63:48.85]Are you like offline?
[63:51.71]That sucked.
[63:52.15]I really wish we could drop a fucking train down there or something.
[63:57.47]You know what I'm saying?
[64:00.77]Can you hear me?
[64:01.81]I can now.
[64:02.89]Hey.
[64:03.27]Oh, I was muted.
[64:03.85]Sorry.
[64:04.11]Yeah.
[64:04.83]I got murdered by a dog.
[64:06.91]Did you get my invite?
[64:08.49]Are you in a different game?
[64:10.23]Yeah.
[64:10.85]I quit out and I got out of there.
[64:13.75]Let's do the mission this time.
[64:15.97]True missions.
[64:17.25]Who even does those?
[64:18.41]Alright.
[64:19.91]Well, actually, I mean, for science, I kind of want to do what we just did again and get stuck there again.
[64:25.02]Multiplayer.
[64:27.80]Can I just pull you in from here?
[64:30.04]There we are.
[64:32.09]Drawing game.
[64:33.69]Did you get it?
[64:34.33]Yep.
[64:34.61]Time for the infinite loading screen.
[64:38.38]How is the game really?
[64:40.10]I have no idea.
[64:41.68]We don't know.
[64:44.00]Can't even judge it one way or another.
[64:46.38]We've done the tutorial.
[64:48.64]Yeah, we've completed tutorial.
[64:51.87]How'd you like the tutorial?
[64:53.01]That was a pretty easy loading screen, actually.
[64:56.09]How far away are you?
[64:58.87]You still in the same area?
[65:01.77]I'm where we started the mission.
[65:03.41]No, I'm where we started the mission.
[65:06.11]Well, that's not possible to Alex.
[65:07.75]We're not even the same game together.
[65:09.43]I totally pushed join off of you.
[65:11.87]It says you have an X. Now it says you have a plus.
[65:15.43]I'm just going to join your game.
[65:16.49]You're unavailable.
[65:18.45]Well, here.
[65:19.69]Did you get that?
[65:20.13]I think you just join automatically.
[65:23.57]There's no permission necessary.
[65:28.41]No, I'm joining you.
[65:31.21]Apparently I'm going in your game.
[65:40.10]Yeah, I can't give like a full how the game is yet.
[65:42.76]I have no idea.
[65:45.20]We did the tutorial and every game session no longer.
[65:47.69]Okay, I think we may have actually fucked up the whole thing.
[65:51.45]Do we need to like go back to single player or something?
[65:53.73]Wait, hold on.
[65:55.39]It says teaming up with Etalyx.
[65:58.91]Teaming up with Etalyx.
[66:02.20]I think Ubisoft thinks we're still in that game and that I'm still a statue in the water.
[66:08.30]I have a new loading screen, apparently.
[66:22.39]You're teamed up with Dermabot!
[66:23.83]Duh!
[66:24.47]Hi.
[66:24.63]Hi.
[66:24.69]Alright, here we go.
[66:26.71]Now we can play again.
[66:29.48]Alright, what were we going to do before?
[66:30.44]What were we trying to do?
[66:31.05]We were going to do this purple mission.
[66:33.31]Alright, let's do the purple mission.
[66:35.49]This one up here.
[66:36.03]Do a purple mission.
[66:37.47]Yeah, well, yeah.
[66:38.51]For every, like, 20, 30 minutes we spend trying to do something stupid, we'll do 20, 30 minutes doing any mission.
[66:43.52]Is that okay, guys?
[66:43.98]We'll do, like, 50 minutes of stupid and, like, 15 minutes of mission.
[66:48.86]And already happening about 15 minutes of stupid because I can't drive over these rocks.
[66:56.64]Alright, we gotta kill this guy.
[66:57.58]Oh, what?
[66:58.60]That's the mission?
[67:00.04]That's the mission.
[67:00.64]No, it's not.
[67:02.50]It isn't.
[67:10.07]He's going the other way!
[67:10.87]Fucking aiming with a controller makes me want to pee.
[67:17.61]Please stop.
[67:19.37]Stop!
[67:20.21]Stop moving!
[67:21.28]Come on!
[67:22.66]Come on!
[67:23.34]You got me.
[67:24.06]Come on!
[67:25.26]Really dead.
[67:28.67]I wish you had seen that.
[67:30.45]He did that on purpose.
[67:36.03]Take us there.
[67:37.45]You want to neutralize this guy again?
[67:41.11]We have to neutralize this guy.
[67:41.95]I don't think that's our mission, but it can be.
[67:46.50]I think it is.
[67:47.02]We have to follow that guy, right?
[67:48.76]I mean, I think this... Easy.
[67:52.94]I think this is like an optional co-op thing.
[67:55.52]Not like an...
[67:59.11]Easy.
[68:00.09]We're going off roading.
[68:02.12]It's not going to work.
[68:03.22]It's not going to work.
[68:04.54]I fell out of the car.
[68:07.30]Oh, it's going to work.
[68:07.84]Get me in the passenger seat like driving Miss Daisy.
[68:14.12]I'm trying to get in the car.
[68:16.38]It's like pushing me every time you do it for some reason.
[68:19.30]Oh, they're shooting me.
[68:21.49]They're shooting me.
[68:26.63]We're about to lose a target.
[68:27.37]We're about to lose a target.
[68:33.64]Oh, okay.
[68:33.86]Let's just give up.
[68:36.04]Officers, have your way with me.
[68:38.84]Don't worry.
[68:39.24]I'll cover you from back here.
[68:44.49]Where are you?
[68:51.69]Oh, fuck.
[68:51.99]I have the cops on me again.
[68:53.92]That fast?
[68:54.70]Just leave me.
[68:55.30]Leave me.
[68:57.46]Watch out for the dog.
[68:59.10]The dog is still in the car with me.
[69:00.98]I just drove directly into a wall.
[69:05.19]This car should be fairly safe, I think.
[69:08.13]No, I don't want to get the dog.
[69:09.15]I want to avoid the dog.
[69:11.11]Fuck, I'm dead.
[69:12.69]Will it spawn you in the car with me?
[69:13.91]Because that would be awesome.
[69:15.44]I think so.
[69:23.04]Nope, I'm up on the ledge again.
[69:24.64]Although I'm right there.
[69:25.36]Just wait for me.
[69:29.08]I would, except the entire police force is chasing me right now.
[69:37.83]Is the helicopter driving on the highway?
[69:40.19]It's landing on the highway.
[69:42.75]What the hell is this thing doing?
[69:46.39]No.
[69:48.16]The dog is barking at where my dead body was.
[69:50.82]I see a couple of things on the map.
[69:57.22]Yeah, I do too.
[70:02.37]Well, let's take a look.
[70:03.51]Let's take a look at the environment.
[70:06.25]Hmm, yeah.
[70:08.09]Yep.
[70:09.41]Alright, this police chase is never gonna end.
[70:12.81]That guy, see him?
[70:13.47]I'm just gonna die.
[70:15.15]Okay.
[70:16.71]What's we got here?
[70:20.01]Interesting.
[70:21.99]See, this is why nobody trusts the police.
[70:27.10]They tell you to stop your vehicle and get out.
[70:28.62]Who are they shooting?
[70:29.52]And they throw grenades on you.
[70:33.13]Dude, that guy... That guy's unloaded on everybody.
[70:37.99]Give me that gun.
[70:39.85]Alright, I'm safe now.
[70:42.35]And I'm right next to a mission.
[70:47.62]These guys are bad guys.
[70:48.66]I think we can clear this out, can't we?
[70:51.68]Why am I holding my gun like a dickhead?
[70:53.22]Alright, I'm gonna quickly do this take-out mission.
[71:05.04]You appear to be very busy with the police and the sons of Ragnarok.
[71:08.94]I'm here at the mission.
[71:11.94]I would love it if someone in this chat could explain to me really quickly.
[71:19.13]I did not hurt that guy once.
[71:22.01]One time.
[71:22.89]Did you get in that mission?
[71:25.37]I don't know what's happening.
[71:26.39]Did you just get teleported into a mission?
[71:28.29]Or was it just me?
[71:28.83]I shot the guy directly in his neck.
[71:30.47]I shot the guy like four times.
[71:32.45]Alright.
[71:34.69]Oh.
[71:34.85]Yeah, I'm here.
[71:35.39]Oh, awesome.
[71:35.77]Alright.
[71:36.86]Download the file.
[71:37.54]You got it.
[71:39.68]Fast travel.
[71:40.56]Yeah, you like teleported to me.
[71:42.24]Watch out!
[71:42.60]Watch out!
[71:44.04]I wanted to try to parkour over his car.
[71:46.14]I thought it would look really cool.
[71:49.94]I can't get in.
[71:53.78]Okay.
[71:54.94]I was in the driver's seat and then you pushed me over.
[71:57.20]What's up with that?
[71:59.76]Oh, watch out!
[72:00.12]You're gonna hack the world!
[72:01.06]Oh, fuck.
[72:01.40]I thought it was gonna blow up.
[72:02.22]Alright, we gotta get in the garage.
[72:06.23]But first, we're gonna make a distraction.
[72:09.43]Never mind.
[72:10.67]In the garage.
[72:11.21]Come on.
[72:14.18]What?
[72:14.76]Oh, this is restricted.
[72:16.92]The only thing in here is a dog.
[72:19.22]You're leaving me in here with a dog?
[72:20.84]Yeah.
[72:21.90]I think I can sneak by the dog.
[72:26.29]Teammate was detected.
[72:33.38]Give me the data.
[72:33.88]Yeah, we're really bad at this mission.
[72:36.80]Come on, give me the unlimited data.
[72:41.76]Open it.
[72:49.68]This probably isn't going to go very well.
[72:51.78]Come on, get the unlimited...
[73:01.12]There it is, quick, no caps.
[73:05.16]Cover me.
[73:05.80]I'm supposed to take a picture of you, right?
[73:07.97]Cover me.
[73:08.27]I have to take a picture of you.
[73:09.39]I gotta cover you with my camera.
[73:10.17]Holy shit, this is gonna take like 10 minutes.
[73:11.35]Hold up, yeah, so I can get my camera out.
[73:13.37]Wait, oh, there we go, get that little selfie.
[73:16.17]A little bit of that.
[73:19.49]I'm downloading it, right?
[73:20.35]So why don't I get credit for it?
[73:25.55]Somebody's shooting.
[73:26.89]Somebody's shooting at you right now.
[73:29.52]Did we do the thing?
[73:30.58]We did the optional thing.
[73:32.58]Alright, get that guy.
[73:35.24]Ow.
[73:35.92]This guy, right here.
[73:38.49]There's a lot of people down here.
[73:44.99]Alright, no more fucking around.
[73:45.97]This is not actually... This is really not good.
[73:49.15]We've come too far.
[73:50.45]I'm terrified to stand up.
[73:52.15]Anything to hack?
[73:53.21]I hacked the thing on the left, but nobody's going over.
[73:54.99]I didn't do anything.
[73:55.53]Yeah, I didn't do one thing.
[73:57.07]Hang on.
[74:02.83]There's a ringing in my ear, guys.
[74:10.26]I wish hacking was this easy in real life.
[74:12.32]All you had to do was murder a whole bunch of people.
[74:17.28]Take a picture of a player downloading data.
[74:20.44]I couldn't do that.
[74:20.98]I did that.
[74:21.26]Can you go download it?
[74:21.98]I think I got it.
[74:24.24]Can you?
[74:24.72]Well, that's not fair.
[74:25.76]I can't take a picture myself.
[74:30.44]What is this?
[74:30.88]There's something in here.
[74:33.81]You see this?
[74:34.63]What is that?
[74:35.03]There's something we can take right here.
[74:38.81]Can we, like, clear the boxes?
[74:44.65]Maybe... Oh, wait, wait, hold on.
[74:45.89]I think we can get in through... Wait, give me this.
[74:51.23]There's a vent up here, but I don't know what you do with it.
[74:56.70]What is this?
[74:59.07]Trigger non-lethal shock.
[75:02.59]A bunch of people in the chat are going to be very mad that we didn't get that.
[75:05.49]Hack the boxes, of course.
[75:06.91]You just had to hack the wooden boxes.
[75:09.59]Hack the boxes?
[75:12.53]Shut up.
[75:15.13]Hang on.
[75:15.49]Do not even tell me that's what you have to do.
[75:18.13]Hack the boxes.
[75:19.35]Hold on.
[75:22.33]There's a... Well, there is a... I hacked this vent earlier.
[75:25.15]This one...
[75:30.05]I don't know why.
[75:30.57]I don't know.
[75:31.43]The vent opened and nothing else happened.
[75:39.04]I see it.
[75:39.68]I can see it from here.
[75:41.06]Hold on.
[75:41.30]It's flashing.
[75:41.86]Let's take a look.
[75:44.68]Pick it up.
[75:45.20]I can see it.
[75:46.42]Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[75:47.60]I got an idea.
[75:48.04]I got an idea.
[75:50.66]Oh, here we go.
[75:55.34]Did you get it?
[75:56.06]There's a guy coming down the stairs right now.
[75:58.26]We're both, like, currently hacking cameras.
[76:00.28]He's gonna shoot you in the head.
[76:01.10]I'm dead.
[76:07.81]I wish it's on my computer.
[76:14.31]Wait, what?
[76:22.52]I like let that happen.
[76:23.46]Alright, how do I get out my little RC car?
[76:26.31]Oh, why have I spawned way... Don't die, by the way.
[76:29.79]I'm not gonna die.
[76:32.79]I need to put my RC car in the vent.
[76:37.26]Where was that vent?
[76:41.10]There was an opening.
[76:41.74]I remember just blindly taking it off.
[76:44.96]You can put your little car in there.
[76:45.98]Yeah, that's what I was just using.
[76:47.14]I was using the car, but then I died.
[76:49.07]Where's the vent?
[76:51.43]Hold on, I'm coming back.
[76:53.55]Where's that vent, man?
[76:55.48]Tweet jump.
[76:57.64]Hold on.
[76:58.06]Alright, let's both do it.
[77:02.54]Rainbow Six Siege.
[77:04.22]Always wanted to play.
[77:08.29]There it is, okay.
[77:13.66]Probably shouldn't do this at the same time.
[77:16.00]There's no way.
[77:16.94]Like, there's gotta be another vent.
[77:19.83]Oh, there's a guy.
[77:20.85]I'm stuck.
[77:23.51]Get out there.
[77:27.19]Get out!
[77:29.71]This is so stupid.
[77:31.45]Alright, you need to get off.
[77:33.68]Get... Alright, you go first.
[77:37.12]There's another vent we can use, by the way.
[77:38.70]Where?
[77:38.82]We're going in the wrong vent.
[77:41.15]Hold on.
[77:41.37]I'm pretty confident.
[77:41.93]Watch out for the dead guy.
[77:43.01]Look, try that vent again.
[77:44.53]There's like a hole in the ground.
[77:45.76]There's like a little grill in the ground.
[77:46.90]You remember taking it off?
[77:49.28]I took it off, but I don't remember what the hell it is.
[77:50.96]Hey, go back and try that other vent real quick.
[77:52.62]I thought that was a fucking guy.
[77:54.08]I was about to freak out.
[77:59.79]Can I like help you get up there?
[78:02.21]Alright, hey, use like me.
[78:03.19]I'm gonna like wedge my body in.
[78:04.91]Move a little bit over to the right.
[78:05.79]A little further.
[78:12.67]Really?
[78:12.97]Yeah.
[78:14.16]Now they hiccup like all the guys.
[78:17.38]It was gonna be funny if it blew you up and then it just didn't do anything.
[78:20.44]You just took an explosion to the face.
[78:23.00]Ah!
[78:24.86]We're good.
[78:30.53]Seriously, I'm getting the box.
[78:31.95]It's upstairs with the dog.
[78:33.67]What?
[78:34.93]Yeah, go to the dog.
[78:40.42]Alright, where is it?
[78:41.28]I knew I took it off somewhere.
[78:44.46]Come on, bingo.
[78:45.44]Bingo!
[78:47.74]Where's the bingo?
[78:50.70]Well, I'm up here.
[78:51.44]Hey, open one of these doors for me.
[78:55.61]Never mind.
[78:59.01]Are we going crazy, or what?
[79:01.43]Uh, it does feel that way.
[79:04.07]I think we... No, I swear to God, dude, I pulled the vent off.
[79:07.03]I promise you.
[79:08.07]Like, it was on the ground.
[79:13.66]I think our collective brains are just too small.
[79:15.42]Alright.
[79:17.98]It's got to be down here.
[79:18.88]There's no way it's up top.
[79:20.97]There's no way.
[79:21.57]Alright, I'm going to say I don't care and I'm going to get in the boat.
[79:28.79]Get in the boat with me.
[79:29.53]We're done.
[79:30.67]We can be the idiots.
[79:31.42]I found it.
[79:33.04]Oh my fuck.
[79:33.76]Hold on.
[79:35.14]I found it.
[79:35.68]I got it.
[79:41.23]A little disorienting, but it's here.
[79:43.83]You get it?
[79:44.13]Hold on.
[79:44.49]Alright.
[79:46.21]Going through the vents.
[79:48.67]So if you get it, do I get it too?
[79:50.15]Maybe.
[79:50.44]I hope so.
[79:56.24]When they come down, let's fuck it up for you.
[80:00.93]Now what?
[80:02.77]Did you get it?
[80:07.31]Are you serious?
[80:08.81]That's not the vent.
[80:09.85]There's more than one vent?
[80:11.51]There's more than one vent.
[80:15.30]It's where we got the data, I think.
[80:18.76]Alright, it's... I still can't... It's time to stop.
[80:21.86]It's time to go.
[80:23.02]It's time to get off.
[80:23.60]I'm gonna get on the ATV.
[80:28.22]I won't vent.
[80:28.82]Any vents?
[80:30.40]Any vents up here?
[80:37.84]Yeah, I'll get on.
[80:38.78]I don't even care.
[80:41.30]I see it.
[80:42.18]You better be able.
[80:42.96]You absolutely better be able to get on this ATV.
[80:44.63]I can't get it.
[80:45.31]Okay, I'm coming.
[80:47.19]What the fuck happened?
[80:50.55]Why did the office just explode?
[80:54.81]Why are you dead?
[80:57.39]Let's get the shit out of me.
[81:00.41]Let's get the shit out of me.
[81:01.95]There's a guy right next to you.
[81:03.39]What?
[81:04.21]You don't see that guy?
[81:04.91]Wait, stop.
[81:08.56]No, there's nobody here.
[81:10.54]There's nobody there?
[81:11.26]Oh, fucking yes, there is.
[81:13.06]Alright, just get out.
[81:15.82]I'm done.
[81:16.84]I'm done with this area.
[81:17.90]But we spent so long looking for it.
[81:20.31]But we still win.
[81:22.71]You don't have to get the super secret money to win.
[81:24.41]Hold on.
[81:26.27]Last try.
[81:27.95]That's the hole that I went through.
[81:28.91]I went through that one.
[81:29.51]I'm coming in.
[81:35.02]I'll come help you.
[81:39.54]Did you find it?
[81:40.26]I mean, I found a vent.
[81:41.60]It's gotta be this vent.
[81:43.30]Just try it again.
[81:44.22]Get in that vent and do it again.
[81:45.20]Oh boy, what are you gonna do to me?
[81:47.54]I'm going to wait till you get it.
[81:49.18]I'm gonna fucking kill him.
[81:50.68]I'm gonna wait till you get it.
[81:51.58]No, you're not.
[81:54.00]The trick.
[81:55.52]There's always a trick.
[81:57.26]Jerma, waiting.
[81:59.50]No.
[82:00.68]Just find it.
[82:01.42]You'll find it soon.
[82:08.16]Did you lose connection, honey?
[82:09.94]No.
[82:11.24]You did not.
[82:12.14]I'm still in my little thing, going the same way I was going before, and I can't find it.
[82:17.28]You're still on... I'm still in my little... Nothing happened.
[82:19.68]No, nothing happened for me.
[82:21.44]Bad joke.
[82:22.99]Okay, well... Nothing happened to him.
[82:26.27]Remember, guys, nothing happened to him.
[82:27.65]It's not a big deal.
[82:28.13]Why am I on top of your motorcycle?
[82:30.73]No, I'm not.
[82:31.19]You just dropped me.
[82:32.19]I was on top of your motorcycle.
[82:35.09]Why are you scooping me up?
[82:37.31]Alright, where's the exit?
[82:39.22]Where's the door to get out of here?
[82:41.38]Uh, hang on, get over here.
[82:44.08]Come over here.
[82:44.76]Okay, hold on, wait, wait, we found something fun to do.
[82:47.18]Yeah, well, no, go over here where my little RC car is jumping around.
[82:55.31]Dude, get out of here.
[82:57.47]Get the fuck out of here, seriously.
[82:58.75]You're gonna do that, and we're gonna get in the road.
[83:01.41]Where did you put my body?
[83:02.43]What do you mean, where did I put you?
[83:04.60]You're sitting in the road over here.
[83:08.55]What did you do with it?
[83:09.86]Oh, hang on, guys.
[83:10.80]I'm fucking running it over, over and over again.
[83:18.76]You're running it over.
[83:20.06]Oh, yeah, you picked me up.
[83:20.86]Alright.
[83:21.64]You got me.
[83:22.18]Now turn.
[83:24.13]Pick me up and go over here.
[83:26.69]Over where?
[83:27.43]See where my bot is?
[83:28.39]To your right?
[83:30.33]Yeah, what are you... Come over here.
[83:31.71]Just come on.
[83:32.51]Pick me up and come on.
[83:34.55]I might be stuck in the wall.
[83:35.91]I'm stuck on a t-shirt.
[83:37.80]Yeah.
[83:39.09]Can you believe it?
[83:39.69]I'm stuck on an Oakland Raiders t-shirt.
[83:42.85]No, I'm not kidding.
[83:45.73]I'm stuck on a fucking t-shirt.
[83:49.63]This t-shirt is made out of some kind of metal.
[83:54.59]Okay.
[83:57.19]Let's see if I can hook you again.
[83:58.43]Alright.
[84:00.03]Sorry, I had to mute for a second.
[84:01.89]I don't have you hooked.
[84:03.65]Well, hook me, baby.
[84:05.70]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[84:09.75]I should have you down.
[84:13.96]Alright.
[84:14.48]It's very awkward in here.
[84:15.46]Alright, let me just make this easier.
[84:19.16]Alright, hold on.
[84:20.94]It's hard to get you on.
[84:22.21]Hold on, I should get it.
[84:22.87]Alright, do it again.
[84:31.75]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[84:33.09]Sit down on your seat.
[84:36.07]I definitely have you.
[84:39.10]Why is my guy stretching?
[84:40.26]I'm still controlling the RC car.
[84:44.52]I'm floating.
[84:49.45]I don't know how many times I have to ram you.
[84:53.37]Can we get out of here now?
[84:54.43]No, I want you to pick me up.
[84:56.75]It's not gonna happen.
[84:57.47]You're in such an awkward spot.
[84:58.71]Alright.
[84:59.15]Jeez.
[85:00.87]You put me there.
[85:01.79]Now I'm awake.
[85:03.55]I'm awake.
[85:04.74]You have to get like on... Okay.
[85:06.18]So let's get out of here.
[85:07.22]Hold on.
[85:07.50]Turn around.
[85:07.96]Turn your car around.
[85:10.28]Is there an escape?
[85:11.16]Yeah.
[85:11.76]That's what I've been trying to do this whole... That was the joke like five minutes ago.
[85:15.92]What was it?
[85:16.72]You'll... Too late now.
[85:18.79]You gotta... Alright.
[85:21.31]Pick me up.
[85:22.61]I should be able to get you now.
[85:26.89]Alright, I have you.
[85:28.21]Okay.
[85:32.67]I wish you would have told me this is what you were trying to do.
[85:34.41]That was the joke, like, ten minutes ago.
[85:36.77]Well, it's alright, because I'm going to drag you out of the door.
[85:39.07]Open the door.
[85:39.49]And I'm taking you for a ride with your little fucking laptop.
[85:47.37]Oh, sorry, there's a piece of sheet metal underneath you.
[85:49.09]I don't know if it'll happen.
[85:51.97]Alright, do I got you?
[85:52.69]Nope.
[85:54.14]Shit.
[85:54.28]I'm back here.
[86:01.66]A little violent.
[86:03.80]You want me?
[86:04.26]Yeah, I got you, I got you, I got you.
[86:09.86]Fuck, no, I don't.
[86:12.84]This is taking really long.
[86:14.91]How did you do it so well the first time?
[86:17.11]I just ran into you, and that same thing happened.
[86:19.13]Come out where there's no walls to run into.
[86:21.47]Just do it right here.
[86:24.71]Ten minutes to execute a joke.
[86:25.89]It's important.
[86:27.99]So now I should be able to just ride into you and not have to worry about like any walls and shit everywhere.
[86:32.01]Let me see if I can get on your motorcycle.
[86:40.44]You can like ride it with me.
[86:46.80]Okay, wait.
[86:47.32]Okay.
[86:47.70]Hold on.
[86:48.16]Okay.
[86:49.81]No, I still got you.
[86:50.45]No, I fell.
[86:51.79]Ah, shit.
[86:54.14]It's time to stop.
[86:55.28]It's time to stop.
[86:57.56]It's so funny, like, people wonder, like, back in the day, like, how did me and Star, like, do the weird shit that we did?
[87:02.07]This is how every Grand Theft Auto video was ever made.
[87:05.75]And we did this for, like, five hours.
[87:06.89]Yeah.
[87:07.53]No, it took a long time.
[87:08.93]I was there for a couple of them.
[87:10.71]Yeah.
[87:14.26]As long as I can get you on top, you should be dragged.
[87:16.70]You know, get out of here.
[87:17.56]Go far away with that thing.
[87:19.14]The variable is your car was not here.
[87:22.07]I was in view.
[87:23.03]Hang on.
[87:23.73]Look.
[87:24.21]There.
[87:26.37]Nope.
[87:26.73]Okay, I give up.
[87:30.77]Nah, it's not going to work.
[87:31.57]Let's go.
[87:32.55]There's so much potential.
[87:35.91]Did we do the mission?
[87:36.59]It really was.
[87:37.65]Both players must... Just leave the area.
[87:43.90]See, what you guys would have seen in, like, a video would be, like, him being dragged down the street.
[87:48.56]Oh, yeah, like that.
[87:49.40]It would have taken us, like, three hours to do it.
[87:52.42]Absolutely.
[87:53.06]Alright.
[87:57.29]We did it.
[87:58.09]We got followers.
[87:58.73]Oh, what a big mission.
[88:03.11]What the?
[88:04.89]What?
[88:06.42]What?
[88:08.34]I have no idea what you're doing.
[88:11.08]Alright, you're gonna do something for me.
[88:12.64]You're gonna drive into me as fast as you can while I'm on this rock, taking a selfie.
[88:17.40]I'll never hit you.
[88:19.92]Oh yeah, you will.
[88:20.44]No, I won't.
[88:21.80]It's not gonna happen.
[88:22.46]Come on, don't have that.
[88:23.36]I'll try it.
[88:23.78]Don't have that mentality.
[88:24.92]I'll try it, but... Have the can-do mentality.
[88:27.43]Have you seen the rock physics in this game?
[88:30.49]Have you seen them?
[88:34.33]You're just gonna go, like, over my head.
[88:35.73]Alright, I'm driving straight at you.
[88:39.07]Whatever happens, happens.
[88:46.03]Ah, whatever.
[88:46.57]Oh, close.
[88:48.61]That was really close.
[88:50.21]Let's go do the actual co-op mission.
[88:53.04]Oh god, not this again.
[88:56.64]We already did the underworld joke.
[88:57.88]No, but the underworld joke was not even the joke.
[89:00.18]The joke was I wanted to get run over taking a picture.
[89:02.00]Yeah, that was like just bonus.
[89:03.94]That was a thing that we didn't even know.
[89:05.22]Alright, we're getting in this truck.
[89:13.51]Okay, apparently not.
[89:16.99]Get on it.
[89:18.37]Oh.
[89:19.97]Hold on.
[89:22.03]Wait, what does she have?
[89:22.67]Anything?
[89:23.09]Has summons for speeding?
[89:24.23]Steal her money.
[89:24.81]Well, I just killed her, so... He told me to get in the truck.
[89:29.14]Just get on top of the truck.
[89:33.90]How do you crouch?
[89:34.84]Oh, I'm just crouched by default.
[89:36.02]I think you just automatically do.
[89:36.94]Alright, you gonna fall or what?
[89:37.86]Looks pretty good.
[89:39.56]You can just stay on there as long as you want.
[89:40.94]Got hit by a couple tree branches, but that's about it.
[89:45.50]Alright, hack the hacker.
[89:46.67]Track mission.
[89:49.41]Okay, I get it.
[89:50.30]You don't have to show me a thousand times.
[89:53.46]T-minus, like, 30 seconds until you attempt to throw me completely off.
[89:59.34]We need to do that, but let's see what happens if I crash.
[90:04.14]No, you just, like, roll backwards.
[90:06.56]No, you don't.
[90:07.37]Did you just fall off the back and slam into the back of the truck like somebody threw you?
[90:13.79]No.
[90:15.07]I rolled on the top and then rolled over the windshield to the front.
[90:18.37]Congrats, Marcus.
[90:19.29]Our follower count is growing fast.
[90:21.77]How many are actually giving us access to their computers?
[90:24.14]You have to hack somebody here.
[90:25.84]They give us access to their power.
[90:27.66]We grow a network of computers that makes us stronger.
[90:29.95]Our own cloud computing network.
[90:33.03]Somebody... What?
[90:33.98]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[90:35.38]Who the fuck is this?
[90:36.10]Download him.
[90:36.90]Download this guy, quick.
[90:38.82]No.
[90:40.06]Is he still alive?
[90:40.84]Did I get it?
[90:41.56]Okay, I'm... I'm still downloading him.
[90:44.16]Is he okay?
[90:45.68]I don't know.
[90:46.22]Oh.
[90:48.45]Well, we may have a problem when reinforcements arrive.
[90:51.45]It's still downloading.
[90:52.75]There's reinforcements coming.
[90:55.81]You gotta protect me while I download them. 30%.
[91:03.11]Who noticed us?
[91:03.65]Here they come.
[91:04.25]Oh, these guys?
[91:04.65]This guy in the fucking Scooby-Doo van.
[91:07.40]That is a Scooby-Doo van.
[91:08.54]Somebody just fell off.
[91:09.56]I don't know if anyone noticed, but somebody fell off the balcony in the top left.
[91:12.36]Somebody fell off that balcony.
[91:15.37]I hope somebody saw that.
[91:24.07]He wouldn't download a person.
[91:26.37]Push that purple van back up.
[91:27.79]Oh, by the way, I don't have to keep that beam on him.
[91:33.16]Which guys are good guys and which guys are bad guys?
[91:39.30]I have no idea.
[91:40.24]I just shot all of them.
[91:41.00]Why did they all fall over?
[91:42.08]Make sure you get their money.
[91:47.78]Did you just run over to get the money?
[91:50.38]Oh, the cops are here.
[91:51.28]I think I just leveled up.
[91:56.52]Did you?
[91:59.24]No, fuck it.
[91:59.98]I want this.
[92:00.36]I want the speedster.
[92:04.72]I have a broken leg.
[92:09.94]Oh, dear.
[92:14.04]Oh, dear.
[92:15.59]I'm being chased.
[92:19.67]Got it.
[92:25.73]Come on.
[92:27.83]I'm trying to hack it, but it's too hard to do three things at once.
[92:34.91]There's money over here.
[92:35.71]There's a bunch of money.
[92:44.74]Get the money.
[92:45.58]Get the money.
[92:47.00]Wait, is this the place we were before?
[92:50.49]This might be the place we were before.
[92:52.17]We can't escape this place.
[92:55.89]We're stuck here.
[92:59.87]We better find the box.
[93:01.65]Better find the hidden bit.
[93:05.00]Watch out for the dog.
[93:11.62]Push that cop backwards and he'll hook it out of our way.
[93:15.11]Why do you push him backwards?
[93:16.77]Oh, you were supposed to keep... Oh, you shut the door too.
[93:22.86]You shut the door on him.
[93:25.72]I crushed him.
[93:27.26]What is hurting me?
[93:28.04]There's cops to your right.
[93:29.90]Oh, shit.
[93:30.56]I'm dead.
[93:33.09]Oh, I think I'm close behind.
[93:35.10]Yeah.
[93:36.24]Yeah.
[93:36.76]We gotta get that fucking briefcase.
[93:40.46]We're back for the briefcase.
[93:41.68]Dude, I squished him.
[93:43.06]I squished him into the wall.
[93:45.46]That was perfect.
[93:47.78]What?
[93:48.02]What?
[93:48.67]Oh, you?
[93:49.05]That's weird.
[93:49.69]You can't hack me.
[93:52.53]Oh, God.
[93:54.33]Thank you, adnova, for two months.
[93:55.23]But who do I look like to you?
[93:56.39]There's like a random guy.
[93:58.03]Like a civilian.
[93:59.55]Actually, are you the main character?
[94:01.22]Are we both the main character?
[94:02.90]I can't even tell.
[94:04.24]I'm the main character on my game.
[94:08.22]You're like a guy with a t-shirt.
[94:09.68]Yeah, I don't know.
[94:13.53]Hang on, I want to level up my guy.
[94:14.73]I want to get some more skills.
[94:16.61]Thank you.
[94:16.87]Also, swim.
[94:17.67]I think, honestly, the research thing is what's probably going to be the most funny.
[94:23.02]I hope so.
[94:24.12]But I'm going to be right back.
[94:25.21]I'm talking to subs.
[94:27.53]Subs, brain.
[94:28.35]Thank you, SwimGoAnus.
[94:29.49]He's willing to shut up.
[94:32.89]Can we stop talking?
[94:37.70]Thank you, ENC96, for your sub.
[94:41.14]Agent D, boy, for two months.
[94:43.54]Hey, Jerm Boy, how is you?
[94:45.06]I'm good.
[94:46.82]Thank you, Repr500, for eight months.
[94:48.82]Your band for life.
[94:50.08]Why am I band for life?
[94:51.98]Cheeseburger, thanks for the 100 bits.
[94:53.90]Yo, bro, it's lit.
[94:56.00]Thanks for the sub.
[94:56.86]Monty the Moose for the bits.
[94:57.98]Thank you, dude.
[94:58.80]Yandel, two months.
[95:01.15]MrChamp619, even nine months.
[95:02.99]Sub, baby, that's correct.
[95:05.25]Sub, baby.
[95:07.91]WhackTF, thanks for the sub.
[95:09.45]And I think I got everybody.
[95:12.97]But thanks a lot, guys.
[95:14.54]I love you.
[95:15.96]Alright.
[95:17.34]Who's beeping, you?
[95:18.28]Who's- no, it's actually just the guy in the bus.
[95:21.00]It's- it's the guy in the bus.
[95:22.00]Yeah, because- because there has been a volcanic eruption in the street, and he can't understand why the car in front of him won't go.
[95:31.87]Come on, what's the big deal?
[95:33.13]Come on, what's the holdup?
[95:34.83]Drive, man, what the fuck?
[95:37.19]It's not like there's a volcanic eruption in the center of the street.
[95:41.11]This is what you deserve.
[95:43.63]Ooh!
[95:45.13]And you too for not finding an alternate route!
[95:46.92]Alright, let's get in the bus.
[95:54.12]There's no door on that side, you dummy.
[95:55.97]You don't enter buses from the left.
[95:58.31]Well, I thought it was like GTA.
[95:59.51]If I was close enough, it would just have me do it.
[96:01.07]This noise is so loud.
[96:02.71]Alright, where are we going?
[96:07.43]Uh, not to the money.
[96:09.21]We're gonna go to the mission marker.
[96:11.15]There's so many cops in that building.
[96:13.91]They're just leftovers.
[96:16.09]You've detonated every volcanic explosion thing.
[96:18.37]You!
[96:19.46]I didn't do that.
[96:19.98]I didn't do these.
[96:20.66]God, we'll have to have some steam.
[96:27.42]Oh, first-person cam.
[96:28.74]Oh, sweet.
[96:29.28]It's like Grand Theft Auto.
[96:30.44]Is it actually first-person cam?
[96:32.08]First-person cam.
[96:35.25]You had to hit down on the D-pad.
[96:37.95]That's so loud.
[96:49.53]I think I hit that guy so hard I knocked his clothes off.
[96:53.47]That guy was naked after I hit him.
[96:55.83]He couldn't take the brunt of the force.
[97:00.99]We need to go all the way.
[97:02.79]Can we fast travel?
[97:04.45]There's probably a closer mission, isn't there?
[97:07.45]Look at how far away these are.
[97:08.53]No, they're all over here.
[97:10.63]Crime hunt.
[97:12.13]Let's do this one.
[97:14.63]Hope you're ready to drive across the bridge again.
[97:17.73]What's this skull?
[97:18.63]Is there a skull on your minimap here?
[97:21.93]There is a skull, but that's an easy, dumb mission.
[97:24.24]Not a hard one.
[97:24.92]Are you sure?
[97:28.53]Alright, well let me get in your car.
[97:30.25]Are you really gonna drive the slowest vehicle in the game?
[97:33.18]Where's the guy we need to kill?
[97:34.32]He says he's up.
[97:37.78]In the penthouse?
[97:39.34]I think you just have to like hack this thing.
[97:42.12]Oh, really?
[97:42.92]Hack this thing, huh?
[97:45.04]You mean like use the bus as the best intrusion method?
[97:50.76]Hmm.
[97:51.64]Is it this guy?
[97:53.44]I don't think it's the guy.
[97:54.40]I think it's this.
[97:57.29]This thing right here.
[97:58.87]We have to find the terminal.
[98:00.11]Who do we have to kill?
[98:01.05]Nobody.
[98:01.41]You don't kill anybody in this mission.
[98:02.84]What's with the skull?
[98:03.62]I don't know.
[98:05.58]I think the skull is when the police come, we're gonna die.
[98:08.26]I'm telling you, dude.
[98:11.04]There's no reason why there would be a skull here in this.
[98:12.74]This is a kill mission.
[98:14.36]I'm following the... Alright, look.
[98:17.26]I'm getting the... It's that thing.
[98:20.30]What thing?
[98:22.56]Hold on.
[98:22.88]Are you in the camera?
[98:23.66]Yeah.
[98:25.27]We're almost there.
[98:29.58]We have to get closer.
[98:37.56]Somehow I don't think that's going to work.
[98:40.30]I see the cops.
[98:40.96]I can see them.
[98:42.36]I'll tag them for you.
[98:43.88]Oh, I'll tag them for you.
[98:45.42]I got them.
[98:47.60]How do you get up there?
[98:49.28]Oh, they hacked me.
[98:52.84]Can you hack me?
[98:53.90]I think you have to unlock a special ability to hack this thing.
[99:00.28]This guy's trying to figure out how to shoot me.
[99:02.51]No, he stepped on me.
[99:07.65]Okay, alright.
[99:08.61]So we gotta get this over here.
[99:10.36]Yeah, the thing you just drew a line to.
[99:12.20]Yeah, it's over there.
[99:14.12]Okay, look at that!
[99:15.82]The cops are here, by the way.
[99:16.94]They're, uh... No, we'll be fine.
[99:19.87]They're directly in front of you.
[99:25.29]What?
[99:26.23]Find the closed circuit terminal?
[99:27.87]Yeah, that's what I was trying to go to.
[99:29.37]It's, like, somewhere this way.
[99:31.23]Isn't that the thing that I just tried to interact with?
[99:34.29]You have to be, like, pretty close with it, don't you?
[99:36.65]No, you gotta be close to it.
[99:40.21]Are you sure about that?
[99:42.84]I don't know!
[99:43.42]Yeah, you do have to be close.
[99:45.20]Let's see.
[99:48.88]Hold on.
[99:50.34]I just had an option.
[99:51.36]Come on.
[99:54.12]Nope.
[99:58.67]I did that because I got aggravated.
[100:01.77]I just got way too aggravated.
[100:02.68]I'm pretty sure you're supposed to be able to use this thing right here.
[100:07.02]What thing?
[100:07.76]But you have to skill up to be able to use it.
[100:09.76]Are you serious?
[100:13.84]That stinks.
[100:14.79]Let me look at my research.
[100:15.67]I'm putting all my shit into the car stuff.
[100:19.21]Well, this is a vehicle.
[100:21.71]Have we leveled up yet?
[100:22.65]I did.
[100:25.43]What is it?
[100:25.89]The dead sec?
[100:26.47]How do you even get research?
[100:27.38]Yeah.
[100:29.55]Alright, cars.
[100:31.85]Uh, hijacker.
[100:32.63]Okay.
[100:33.25]What else can I do?
[100:33.95]Yeah, that's kind of fun.
[100:34.67]Can I do that already?
[100:35.25]How do you get over there?
[100:36.25]It's tinkering.
[100:57.04]Electroshock device?
[100:57.98]I give up.
[100:58.64]Screw the skull.
[100:59.72]Skull mission sucks.
[101:00.40]Oh, boy.
[101:01.24]Explosive device.
[101:02.04]We're doing that.
[101:03.50]Yeah, we're going down the tinkering tree.
[101:11.70]Nice.
[101:12.62]This is going to be perfect.
[101:13.32]I can make, like, grenades.
[101:14.42]Finally.
[101:14.90]I heard this lady say something weird on the phone.
[101:16.60]Alright, what else can I do here?
[101:20.53]Energy.
[101:22.07]Remote control for forklifts, scissor lifts, and cranes?
[101:27.03]I can control a forklift.
[101:28.05]That's the thing.
[101:30.09]That's the thing?
[101:30.71]I think it is.
[101:32.09]It's not a forklift, but it's related.
[101:35.56]It's in the family of things.
[101:38.06]Do you know Ghostbusters?
[101:40.28]I am aware of Ghostbusters.
[101:41.46]The thing that they hold the ghosts in.
[101:44.14]The vacuum packs?
[101:46.31]When they're in the Ghostbusters headquarters, the thing that the guy shuts down, this is the forklift.
[101:54.61]What else can I do down here?
[101:57.79]Quad copter.
[101:59.05]Middle finger.
[102:00.17]Alright, how do you get more hacker points?
[102:01.61]How do you, like, boost your battery signal?
[102:04.69]I don't know.
[102:06.97]Speed boost.
[102:07.65]Ah, it's dumb.
[102:10.11]Cooldown reduced.
[102:11.07]Equip the jumper with the IEDs and zappers.
[102:16.28]I mean, that's kind of cool.
[102:17.60]You can fly around and put big bombs.
[102:19.46]You can just drop bombs on people.
[102:23.44]Ugh.
[102:24.32]There's so many stupid things I want.
[102:25.56]What are, like, the cheat codes?
[102:28.94]Increase available botnet by four.
[102:30.61]I guess that's probably good to have.
[102:32.95]Because you're going to be using it a lot.
[102:36.63]Yeah, I'll do that.
[102:37.85]Fine.
[102:40.21]Reload speed.
[102:40.73]Who cares?
[102:41.21]We're killing most of our people in the game with cars anyways.
[102:45.48]I'll do this.
[102:50.06]I want to test out my new toy.
[102:53.47]Yeah, I want to test out my forklift.
[102:56.76]Did you really buy the forklift one?
[102:58.86]No.
[103:00.24]I bought the stun electroshock device thing.
[103:05.34]Wherever that is, there it is.
[103:06.34]Alright, let's try it.
[103:09.28]How do I use it?
[103:17.34]Alright, that's cool.
[103:26.12]Alright, what did you just do?
[103:26.80]I can throw a targeted... Come on, Shreddy.
[103:29.14]See that guy?
[103:29.62]See the lady over there?
[103:35.10]Well, what if... I missed her, but she would have got electrocuted.
[103:37.38]Hold on, hold on.
[103:40.02]Oh, wait for it.
[103:41.00]Give it a second.
[103:43.46]What?
[103:44.42]Just give it a second.
[103:45.13]Alright, I'm giving it a second.
[103:48.67]There we go.
[103:49.97]Why did she walk over there?
[103:50.93]Because I made it make a noise.
[103:54.64]Oh.
[103:55.10]Can I shock this guy out of the car?
[103:56.30]Hold on.
[103:56.62]Wait for the cooldown.
[103:57.16]I want to see if this guy electrocutes himself out of the car.
[104:02.47]I got, like, five or ten more seconds before we can try it.
[104:04.81]Oh, these people are so dumb.
[104:07.93]I can't even afford the upgrade.
[104:09.11]How do you get more hacker points to, like, do things?
[104:12.52]It might have something to do with co-op.
[104:13.46]Is it the botnet?

[104:45.30]Poor guy.
[104:45.86]I shot it right in the brain.
[104:47.54]It's in his ass.
[104:47.90]What are these two doing over here?
[104:50.54]Oh, they get on their knees so they don't get shot.
[104:52.32]Alright, let's go to the next thing.
[104:59.62]Nobody cares that I have an Uzi.
[105:00.83]I know, right?
[105:02.47]This is a sweet ride.
[105:03.55]That's pretty cool.
[105:05.63]And that police officer has no idea that we are... I want this, but no, we can't both ride it.
[105:15.50]This thing drives like shit, by the way.
[105:17.74]Okay, what is this?
[105:18.46]What are we going towards?
[105:20.00]Uh... That's... This thing's so loud.
[105:23.06]It is.
[105:24.26]I want to get out of this.
[105:25.73]It's really loud.
[105:26.69]Alright, next opportunity we see the car that's good dumping this thing.
[105:32.95]Oh, we're going to go in the Ted Williams Tunnel.
[105:36.35]What are we even going towards right now?
[105:39.17]I have no idea.
[105:40.53]Take a look.
[105:44.84]Um...
[105:46.41]Sorry to everybody's eardrums.
[105:49.57]There you go.
[105:50.61]Yeah, this car sucks.
[106:00.59]Get out of it.
[106:04.31]We'll find something better on the freeway.
[106:06.45]We'll find something better in one second.
[106:08.11]Like, I'll take the fucking forward focus.
[106:09.99]I don't even care.
[106:11.57]Oh, God, please, lady.
[106:14.29]Get out!
[106:14.75]Get out!
[106:15.93]Oh, I forgot I'm still in Park Park.
[106:17.37]On to the Golden Gate Bridge.
[106:22.19]Where the hell are you going?
[106:26.03]I'm doing a donut.
[106:28.21]I think we have an adversary mission.
[106:33.73]Well, I... You still have the blue line on the ground?
[106:36.27]Because I set a waypoint like 2,000 meters in that way.
[106:39.73]It's so far away.
[106:40.37]At least we're going to be in the city now.
[106:41.29]What do you think the odds are that we can climb to the top of the bridge?
[106:43.39]I don't know.
[106:47.58]I wonder.
[106:50.28]If you see a little spot where we can get up there, then we're stopping and we're gonna do it.
[106:55.10]Wait a minute.
[106:55.52]Is there?
[106:55.90]Might be.
[106:56.28]Maybe.
[106:57.73]I'm checking every little option.
[106:59.41]Because that would be fun.
[107:01.41]Come on, ladder.
[107:02.65]Come on, ladder.
[107:03.23]This is a nice car.
[107:04.35]I'll take this one.
[107:05.35]Oh, no ladder.
[107:06.67]There's gotta be a ladder on one of these.
[107:08.23]You know that the guys that made this game were like... Why am I... Eventually they're gonna want to get up on the top.
[107:14.42]Oh my god.
[107:17.29]What's the matter?
[107:17.71]He's beating me up.
[107:20.09]Who is beating you up?
[107:20.70]This guy.
[107:21.78]This guy.
[107:23.60]How many guys are you fighting?
[107:25.02]I stole a car.
[107:26.04]They don't like it.
[107:27.44]This is a pretty fast car.
[107:30.96]You ran this person completely over on the bike.
[107:34.02]On the bike?
[107:34.44]Hold on.
[107:39.28]He's making all kinds of like... This guy's stuck in like an AI loop.
[107:45.23]It's going to be great.
[107:52.27]This police officer did a 180 in the road and decided I was the target.
[107:58.57]And it was me.
[108:01.15]There he is.
[108:01.63]Neutralize him.
[108:02.44]Oh, he's right here.
[108:03.36]Well, this is a guy.
[108:04.18]Fuck, wrong car.
[108:13.72]That cop was just skimming around.
[108:22.67]Neutralizing.
[108:24.27]Can you not shoot while in a vehicle?
[108:25.65]I don't think you can.
[108:27.51]Oh, yeah, you can.
[108:28.01]Maybe it's like an upgrade.
[108:30.07]Hold on.
[108:30.57]I'll be able to stop him in a second.
[108:34.18]Oh, that's your car.
[108:35.56]Sorry.
[108:35.82]You can only use your stun gun.
[108:44.35]Don't let him get away.
[108:45.23]This got really bad somehow.
[108:47.07]Wow, you were supposed to neutralize him.
[108:49.03]I've only got a stun gun.
[108:52.77]Alright, don't hit me.
[108:53.61]I can make him stop.
[108:56.23]He stopped.
[108:59.29]Oooh, boy.
[109:00.63]He's turning around.
[109:02.03]He's a smarty.
[109:06.91]Didn't get him.
[109:08.08]Did not.
[109:08.62]I didn't get him, if you're curious.
[109:12.14]Shortcut!
[109:16.72]Meanwhile, I'm getting murdered by police officers.
[109:21.00]Shortcut!
[109:22.99]Told ya!
[109:27.65]What is this guy's deal?
[109:30.01]I didn't even see that medium.
[109:33.03]I'm dead.
[109:34.07]These guys are driving around in circles!
[109:37.33]What?
[109:38.27]Huh?
[109:39.83]What did I get zapped by?
[109:42.25]What zapped me?
[109:45.17]Are you dead?
[109:45.61]Because I'm dead.
[109:47.47]Yeah.
[109:48.26]Yeah.
[109:50.08]What did you do to piss all those people off?
[109:53.00]I got struck by lightning.
[109:54.94]Oh.
[109:56.32]Oh, check it out, man.
[109:56.90]New clothes.
[109:57.28]You gotta put on something funny.
[110:02.03]Wait a minute.
[110:02.31]Where is it?
[110:02.69]Where is it?
[110:05.11]Come on.
[110:05.57]Where's the twitch.tv hoodie?
[110:08.57]I know it exists.
[110:14.47]That's not it.
[110:24.15]Why do I have like a picture of a backpack on my t-shirt?
[110:44.35]What did that look like to you?
[110:45.69]It's fucking crazy.
[110:50.90]It's just... Oh my god.
[110:54.08]Does it keep you in the menu while you do that?
[110:57.24]I did not expect that.
[110:59.72]I was not expecting that at all.
[111:03.80]That was an A+.
[111:04.42]That was A+.
[111:09.58]You're just blowing by the screen.
[111:11.86]Alright, drive straight at me.
[111:13.88]Like, and hit you, or straight at you and not hit you?
[111:16.12]Like, straight at me into the chaos.
[111:18.03]Hold on, there's so many cars in the road here.
[111:23.07]Oh, that looks nice.
[111:23.91]What do I got for glasses?
[111:25.25]Oh, hats.
[111:26.81]Oh, yeah.
[111:27.19]Teamwork bucket.
[111:27.94]Hold on.
[111:28.14]I'm not sure if I like that one.
[111:29.52]They do the thing where when you... Whatever.
[111:32.52]I don't... I don't know.
[111:33.62]Should I put that...
[111:39.97]No, come straight at me.
[111:42.41]That was straight.
[111:43.83]No, no.
[111:44.31]Yeah, that was straight at you.
[111:48.81]That was directly where you were standing.
[111:51.30]It was like Speedy Gonzales.
[111:53.66]Hold on.
[111:56.42]I got to clear some of this car debris off the road.
[111:58.68]No, I'm talking about like you drive the car directly into my chest and the kiosk.
[112:04.50]Oh, and there's not enough room.
[112:06.78]There has to be.
[112:07.46]Hang on.
[112:08.08]I'm clearing some of the space.
[112:09.10]Alright.
[112:15.93]I'm gonna tell you when to do it because I do like a... Yeah.
[112:18.21]Okay.
[112:18.73]Just do it whenever.
[112:20.15]I'm gonna tell you when to do it, dude.
[112:21.83]Do it.
[112:22.07]Hold on.
[112:22.83]Because, like, I'm just trying to... I'm trying to get the RNG for when he, like, looks at how cool his clothes look.
[112:28.36]There's another person here, too.
[112:31.82]Alright.
[112:32.02]Pretty cool looking.
[112:32.48]This has got to be the one.
[112:34.14]These are some sweet teas.
[112:36.41]Yeah, I like that one.
[112:37.21]I like this one.
[112:37.61]This one's green.
[112:38.81]That one's purple.
[112:40.73]What other color T's do we have?
[112:43.63]Was that as funny as you hoped it would be?
[112:44.97]Because there's no room.
[112:47.22]There's no room.
[112:48.08]Look.
[112:49.32]Get out of the menu and look at my room.
[112:51.36]Can you just... I need you to do that.
[112:53.22]You need to see how funny that is.
[112:55.40]Get out of your car.
[112:56.26]I got an idea.
[112:57.66]Get in that white car.
[112:59.20]I'm in like fucking pink underwear.
[113:00.82]Then we're going to move the black car.
[113:02.02]Then we're going to move the truck.
[113:04.36]Then we're going to move the red car.
[113:07.03]Actually, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[113:09.53]I have something funnier.
[113:10.33]Get on the bike.
[113:12.13]Get on the bike, and I want you to throw your body into me.
[113:14.10]You know what I mean?
[113:15.40]Like, ghost ride yourself directly into me.
[113:19.02]You need to see what this looks like, because then you have to ghost ride.
[113:21.60]Like, I want you to fly, like, just roll into my view.
[113:25.36]Alright, you ready to see how hilarious this is?
[113:28.27]Just be looking at shirts.
[113:31.31]I love San Francisco.
[113:34.59]Ooh, this one's got the state bear on it.
[113:41.09]I fucked it up.
[113:41.71]It just like carries you out of the screen.
[113:43.95]I screwed it up.
[113:44.65]Do it again.
[113:46.75]I gotta get like a bunch of speed.
[113:47.94]I told you it was difficult.
[113:49.08]Now you're gonna understand.
[113:50.02]There are so many cars in the way too.
[113:57.12]Ooh, nice little rainbow sweater.
[114:00.13]You've missed.
[114:02.21]He missed.
[114:03.75]Hold on, it's gonna explode.
[114:14.18]Everyone's just dying around me while I select a turn.
[114:20.73]I'm laughing too hard at this.
[114:22.49]I can't do it.
[114:23.99]If you saw this from my perspective... Okay.
[114:29.53]Okay.
[114:31.08]Okay.
[114:33.66]Can you get on the bike and throw yourself at me?
[114:35.84]Oh my gosh.
[114:37.08]Where even is the bike?
[114:38.24]Here it is.
[114:39.04]I don't even care if you go by me.
[114:42.32]I don't care if you fly by me.
[114:43.76]Just throw yourself into me.
[114:52.73]Oh, wait.
[114:53.25]Hold on.
[114:54.81]Gotta get a running start.
[114:56.33]They're calling the police.
[115:01.50]Hey, what's your emergency?
[115:02.48]911, what's your emergency?
[115:07.86]That didn't even knock me down.
[115:11.08]Alright, let's get out of here.
[115:12.06]Let's move on.
[115:12.70]Before we can't stop.
[115:14.58]911, what is your emergency?
[115:17.77]Ah, a guy just fucking followed by me.
[115:21.41]What happened to this car?
[115:23.05]That's probably the original one that we were trying to ram into the stupid kiosk with.
[115:27.75]What?
[115:28.11]It's already, like, exploding.
[115:38.67]This one's new.
[115:39.23]Alright, what else can we do now?
[115:45.67]Anything else we can do that's fun?
[115:46.99]Did it just explode?
[115:51.08]It did.
[115:51.42]Alright, give us a...
[115:56.22]I don't know if it'll work for you when we haven't even gone over the bridge.
[116:01.48]I think we went halfway across the bridge and we turned around to neutralize the target.
[116:05.87]Alright, this one.
[116:06.33]You got my shit on the ground?
[116:08.59]I got my own.
[116:09.11]I'm heading towards the bounty target.
[116:11.39]Yeah, just head towards the thing that we need to go towards.
[116:13.29]Are we going to actually do something?
[116:16.34]Let's do something, yeah.
[116:17.26]We're going to actually go for it.
[116:20.74]We're going to go for a do.
[116:23.60]I don't know how it's possible, man.
[116:24.83]Like, my brain is not comprehending any of this situation.
[116:27.89]I thought we already went over this fucking bridge.
[116:30.65]No.
[116:31.09]No.
[116:31.19]Did we turn around and went back?
[116:33.89]That's what... We did that.
[116:34.65]We turned around and went backwards.
[116:35.69]We turned around because we saw a guy that said, like, catch the guy, and we both turned around to go chase him.
[116:40.16]That's right.
[116:41.76]That's right.
[116:45.50]I forgot about the catch the guy minigame.
[116:49.36]Someone is suggesting we walk up the cables.
[116:51.32]That's what I was thinking, too, but it looks like a long walk.
[116:56.36]Let's do it.
[117:00.08]Where can we get on there?
[117:03.62]If we bring, like, a semi... Easy.
[117:05.16]I was trying to ramp.
[117:06.64]If we bring a semi over here, you think?
[117:08.80]Ah.
[117:08.92]Hey, I want to, like, look.
[117:12.79]There's a bus.
[117:13.41]There's a bus coming your way.
[117:14.43]Is there a bus coming?
[117:15.87]Here's a bigger truck coming afterward.
[117:18.35]What's going on?
[117:22.48]Okay.
[117:22.98]There's nobody in this car anymore.
[117:25.87]This could work.
[117:26.43]I don't think it's gonna work.
[117:28.57]It's not high enough.
[117:35.25]Damn it.
[117:36.98]We make it halfway across the bridge and we turn around again.
[117:39.56]Oh, see ya.
[117:41.52]You can jump off.
[117:42.70]You can jump off the bridge.
[117:43.60]Yeah, you certainly can.
[117:45.22]Yeah, you certainly can.
[117:47.04]You stuck in the middle of the water?
[117:49.25]Yeah.
[117:52.61]Is there a way to suicide, or...?
[117:54.27]There's a way I can get up.
[117:55.96]Oh.
[117:57.34]By the way, the semi is not tall enough for this.
[117:59.30]No way.
[118:00.02]No, it's not.
[118:01.58]What about at the very beginning?
[118:03.04]That's what I was going towards.
[118:04.00]Are there, like, helicopters in this game?
[118:06.88]Yeah, there are.
[118:07.58]I mean, they chase us.
[118:08.54]I assume you can fly them.
[118:10.96]Get to the very, very start of the bridge.
[118:12.39]Like, all the way across it.
[118:14.25]And I think we might be able to get up that way.
[118:17.76]Better than below the water?
[118:18.70]That's true.
[118:19.16]Yeah, don't worry, kids.
[118:22.11]Just jump off the Golden Gate Bridge.
[118:23.37]You'll be fine.
[118:24.61]Here's some ad money, Mr. Yerma.
[118:26.81]Well, thank you, dude.
[118:27.85]Just like real life.
[118:28.55]Thank you, Dima.
[118:30.61]Also, thanks to Muffin Sticks.

[118:46.26]Thanks, dude.
[118:46.76]Okay.
[118:51.23]Bumping into cars nearly killed me.
[118:53.81]Holy shit, this is taking an age of eternity.
[118:55.99]This is taking an age of empires.
[119:00.98]ResidentSleeper, great stream.
[119:04.47]The swim stream?
[119:05.37]You don't like the swim stream?
[119:10.62]Give me this.
[119:12.72]Do not be alarmed.
[119:13.56]I'm coming to get your boat.
[119:14.96]Nah.
[119:16.30]No, you're going to try and do it again.
[119:19.05]I'm going to stop you again.
[119:19.77]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[119:21.61]Now she's pissed.
[119:23.19]She's trying to figure out what's wrong with her boat.
[119:24.47]Look, she's going to go... What's going on?
[119:27.19]What happened?
[119:43.46]Jeez.
[119:45.46]She's still in the boat.
[120:01.95]Well, if there was any curiosity, she was dead.
[120:06.81]She is now.
[120:09.09]Are you here?
[120:10.93]Yeah, I see you in a speedboat.
[120:14.38]Man.
[120:14.94]What?
[120:16.12]That was terrible.
[120:16.94]She just hit her head.
[120:19.94]Okay.
[120:20.12]Has anybody seen the movie?
[120:22.24]It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world.
[120:25.02]Hold on.
[120:25.80]If you've seen that movie, remember the guy with the plane?
[120:27.88]Oh, yeah.
[120:28.96]It's a great day to fly.
[120:30.46]I can't see.
[120:31.64]Remember when that guy's just hitting his head over and over again on the plane?
[120:35.36]That's what that was.
[120:36.46]Dude, I am so close.
[120:37.20]If anybody knows what I'm talking about.
[120:38.22]Ooh, a bike.
[120:39.10]Ooh, you got a bike?
[120:40.72]Bring it over here.
[120:43.53]I have a bike and I have beach goers.
[120:44.75]I want to hack more things.
[120:47.43]I need more hack juice.
[120:58.42]How can I get up here?
[121:00.05]I really don't think this is possible.
[121:02.09]Let's see what they're talking about.
[121:03.73]I see your outfit is missing.
[121:08.08]I'll only use it if I have to.
[121:09.34]I think this truck is stuck forever.
[121:14.06]My secret identity.
[121:16.20]Oh, you're not a superhero.
[121:17.26]Are we just going to go to the mission?
[121:20.56]Or are we going to keep trying to get to the top of the bridge?
[121:23.68]I'm the Joker!
[121:25.26]I'm the Joker!
[121:29.46]Look at me, I'm the Joker!
[121:32.68]You think you're a superhero?
[121:33.62]It's me, Joker!
[121:34.20]Oh, Mike!
[121:34.68]Alright, I'm coming.
[121:41.02]Oh, Mike!
[121:42.50]I killed that guy, actually.
[121:48.34]Okay.
[121:49.44]So.
[121:51.22]I think it might be possible.
[121:52.20]I don't know.
[121:52.56]I'm getting pretty close.
[121:53.42]Are you trying to jump up on a semi?
[121:57.85]Yeah.
[121:59.27]Good joke.
[122:02.56]No, I was making a joke that, like, that's, like, dumb to do.
[122:05.10]Like, I'm the Joker.
[122:06.14]I don't believe in that Batman vigilante.
[122:08.86]If we could, like, stack on each other's heads, it would work.
[122:12.78]What about this Symmetra?
[122:16.90]Symmetra has a ladder on it.
[122:19.42]Okay.
[122:20.10]Sounds promising.
[122:23.18]Coming.
[122:26.71]Sounds like the beginning of a dubstep song.
[122:28.29]Do you have explosive yet?
[122:31.71]No.
[122:31.81]You can't do that.
[122:32.47]You can't go over the rail.
[122:33.27]You gotta go forward.
[122:35.45]Go forward.
[122:36.07]Go around the rail.
[122:37.53]Oh, no.
[122:38.69]Yeah.
[122:41.72]Aww.
[122:43.92]That's no good.
[122:45.34]It's gonna take ages to do that.
[122:48.28]This thing is so heavy.
[122:51.26]I'm just crushing cars when I touch them.
[123:01.67]I think you went a little far.
[123:04.91]A little far?
[123:05.43]I had to go all the way down here, didn't I?
[123:13.11]I need a backup, don't I?
[123:14.31]Yeah.
[123:15.91]Well, I've got a truck already there, and it's kind of in the way, so you might need to push it out of the way.
[123:22.04]What?
[123:23.06]I've already done this.
[123:23.72]What do you think I've been doing while you were swimming with the fishes?
[123:27.16]Wait, hold on.
[123:27.58]This is important.
[123:34.15]That wasn't even close to being funny.
[123:35.57]Never mind.
[123:35.89]Let's go back to doing this.
[123:36.66]I was trying to do a song and that was not even remotely close to being something funny.
[123:47.32]What the fuck happened to you?
[123:50.49]Get me by this lamppost.
[123:52.27]Where did your bike go?
[123:54.87]Oh, here it is.
[123:55.69]I found it.
[124:02.85]Alright.
[124:03.73]Moment of truth.
[124:04.53]This is just a random bike.
[124:05.75]I don't know which.
[124:07.51]Shit, you do have a dumb thing here.
[124:09.61]Alright, I'm gonna try to get you out of the way.
[124:13.86]Success.
[124:14.74]Alright.
[124:15.48]We can't... I'm kind of wedged up here a little bit.
[124:21.88]So you tell me this is not tall enough?
[124:25.64]You almost hit me with that bike.
[124:27.40]Did I really?
[124:29.62]We can't even climb up this thing.
[124:35.35]Of course the ladder is on the wrong side.
[124:37.59]This is over.
[124:41.24]It's over.
[124:41.88]Let's go.
[124:43.80]I'm so disappointed.
[124:47.04]How did they possibly ever think that you wouldn't want to climb on top of the bridge?
[124:50.70]You can definitely get up there.
[124:52.08]There's no way you can't.
[124:54.90]We've got to get another truck to unwedge that truck.
[125:01.55]I thought you couldn't shoot out of cars.
[125:04.42]But today we learned.
[125:10.12]The aim is really weird when you're in the car by the way.
[125:12.14]It like zooms way in.
[125:13.36]The sensitivity is like insane.
[125:18.38]We're going to do that mission we talked about like 40 minutes ago?
[125:20.32]Oh yeah, that purple mission.
[125:21.26]Yeah.
[125:22.00]No, we're not going to hack the hacker unless it's what we're supposed to do.
[125:26.15]No, we're not.
[125:26.71]Turn around.
[125:27.17]No, we're going the right way.
[125:28.11]You're going the wrong way.
[125:28.67]You're going the wrong way.
[125:29.73]No, we're going the right way.
[125:30.91]You're going the wrong way.
[125:31.69]No.
[125:33.12]This is the right way.
[125:33.82]You are going the wrong way.
[125:35.58]No.
[125:37.37]That's how it looks.
[125:38.09]You are going the wrong way.
[125:39.35]No.
[125:40.71]Not to where I'm going.
[125:42.79]Where are you going?
[125:43.97]The bounty mission.
[125:45.51]No, this is the hack the hacker.
[125:46.89]No, it's not.
[125:47.33]It's a bounty.
[125:48.57]Is that hack the hacker?
[125:50.69]I think this is the thing that's just exploding on the screen.
[125:57.08]What did you do?
[125:57.70]I didn't do a single thing.
[125:59.04]What?
[126:05.15]Why?
[126:05.61]Am I still alive?
[126:08.32]I am.
[126:09.32]I'm still alive.
[126:10.14]How did that happen?
[126:11.78]What?
[126:15.06]I got you.
[126:16.30]What?
[126:16.76]Seriously, what happened?
[126:18.90]Why did it blow up the second time?
[126:23.18]Because I have a dick?
[126:24.60]No, but the first time I understand it's a road hazard.
[126:27.68]The second time I don't understand.
[126:29.61]How did you blow it up?
[126:31.77]What is this?
[126:32.11]I hacked it.
[126:34.14]Online PvP bounty.
[126:37.16]Okay.
[126:40.18]I think... No, we don't want to do that.
[126:41.72]I told you we were going the wrong way.
[126:42.73]But it's purple.
[126:44.91]Did you just do it?
[126:45.59]No.
[126:47.07]Why is it DayZ in this game now?
[126:50.15]Like, the color scheme of the world is like DayZ.
[126:53.45]What is this dog doing?
[126:55.99]Wait, you can pet the dogs.
[126:57.87]Holy shit, you can pet the dogs.
[127:00.43]Haven't you got better things to do?
[127:08.42]Drop the gun.
[127:10.10]That's where I draw the line.
[127:10.82]It was just a stun gun.
[127:12.54]He'll be fine.
[127:13.20]That's where I draw the line.
[127:16.26]Here's where you're wrong.
[127:17.52]You want to play Harry Potter wands with me?
[127:20.38]He's still alive.
[127:21.53]Yeah.
[127:21.73]Alright.
[127:22.07]Now he's not.
[127:23.03]Do you want to play Harry Potter wands with me?
[127:26.33]Yeah, go ahead.
[127:26.97]Put it out.
[127:27.37]Let's do it.
[127:29.43]Harry...
[127:31.29]Oh, my covenant form.
[127:34.71]You're not doing the joke.
[127:35.44]How do I do that?
[127:36.40]Like that?
[127:36.76]Aim it at me.
[127:37.94]Mine's green, too.
[127:38.86]Oh, yeah.
[127:40.18]Oh, that's not funny, then.
[127:41.60]I wish yours wasn't green.
[127:54.49]I can't do any of my funny, fun hacks.
[127:56.36]Got him in the leg.
[127:56.88]Because I don't have enough hacker juice.
[127:58.98]Alright, just be aware, Alex.
[128:01.06]Shooting somebody in the top of their Converse sneaker is a death shot.
[128:04.56]It's a kill shot.
[128:05.54]If you're curious.
[128:08.24]Told you you were going the wrong way.
[128:09.12]You didn't want to believe me.
[128:09.86]So now I'm gonna fucking peel out in front of you.
[128:11.54]In front of your viewers.
[128:18.92]This thing ain't driving right.
[128:21.17]Somebody might have shot out the tires.
[128:24.73]Peel out now, good boy.
[128:31.93]What is this thing?
[128:32.63]I better say at least 25 LOLs in the chat.
[128:38.06]I told you we were going the wrong way.
[128:38.92]I wanted to do that mission.
[128:39.82]Alright, well where am I going now?
[128:42.48]Hot shot.
[128:43.20]You're going to come pick me up.
[128:45.24]Which mission are we doing?
[128:48.39]The Fisherman's Wharf?
[128:51.07]What's the argument going on over here?
[128:55.64]Hey, look, more dogs.
[128:56.66]We pet the dog.
[129:00.28]Okay.
[129:04.96]Sure.
[129:06.00]I can't pet that dog, apparently.
[129:08.68]I want their car.
[129:10.40]Dude, what the fuck is this, by the way?
[129:13.22]It's a bunch of random thugs and hooligans.
[129:17.56]He's throwing a grenade at you, by the way.
[129:19.14]I hope you realize that.
[129:22.14]Why are they doing this?
[129:22.94]They're on like a basketball court in like a condo complex.
[129:25.60]This doesn't make any fucking sense.
[129:28.02]Yeah, guys.
[129:28.70]Make sure we protect our bag of money at the basketball court at the local condo.
[129:34.49]What was that?
[129:36.73]The physics were so... I don't want to do it.
[129:40.03]I don't want to do this.
[129:40.69]Alright, I just hit him with a yo-yo.
[129:42.95]It's okay.
[129:47.09]Nice auto-aim, by the way.
[129:48.04]That was great.
[129:48.80]Great auto-aim.
[129:51.39]Yeah.
[129:51.63]This is the car I wanted.
[129:54.37]The lowrider.
[129:55.03]Did you get the bag of money?
[129:56.75]I did, yeah.
[129:57.90]$2,000.
[129:57.98]Nice.
[129:58.76]Two grand.
[130:01.22]$18,000 actually, buddy.
[130:04.80]Do that again.
[130:06.82]Don't ruin my fun.
[130:07.36]Okay, that's cool.
[130:08.78]Get out of here.
[130:10.88]These are my tires.
[130:12.83]Don't you ever come over to the basketball court again.
[130:15.83]This is our basketball court.
[130:17.61]We stand here, four of us, with two dogs, every day, and we... Alright, get in.
[130:23.65]Isn't this cool?
[130:28.83]I've got, like, super suspension.
[130:32.18]Let's do it.
[130:33.98]Stop moving around.
[130:34.74]You have to stop moving the car.
[130:35.98]Yes!
[130:39.42]Alright, give me a waypoint.
[130:42.62]I'm gonna give you a waypoint.
[130:44.18]This is a loud car.
[130:45.02]I'm gonna stay in the mini-map.
[130:46.52]Here's where I wanted to go.
[130:47.44]We have to go get worms.
[130:55.67]Hold on.
[130:56.19]This is... You're gonna Dave and Buster us over?
[131:01.29]No, not Dave and Buster.
[131:02.33]Yeah, you wanna play some pinball?
[131:05.41]You wanna play some Time Crisis 3?
[131:06.51]Let's go Dave and Buster.
[131:08.45]Laurel and Hardy, no.
[131:10.99]The Dukes of Hazzard.
[131:16.32]Slowing him down so he can't get to the guy he needs to save.
[131:20.74]My left ear is really... I'm fine.
[131:27.97]You have vanished from the map, though.
[131:32.47]You're gone.
[131:33.43]Oh, Rage Face!
[131:35.43]You are not even on my map.
[131:38.80]Can I please just act like a human being for once in your life?
[131:45.99]The Dukes of Hazzard, not Dave and Buster's.
[131:47.61]Dave and Buster's.
[131:49.91]Alright, come get me.
[131:51.01]Come get me.
[131:51.43]Drive over here.
[131:51.97]Alright, three, two, one, jump.
[132:00.20]I have to do, like, climb down.
[132:02.18]I can't just fall off.
[132:03.24]Yeah, you just hold, like, you push left on the stick.
[132:05.32]Alright, you ready?
[132:07.42]Three, two, one, go.
[132:14.11]It worked.
[132:14.91]It worked.
[132:15.73]It was awesome, but the game sucks.
[132:19.03]It didn't, like, that was perfect.
[132:20.81]It couldn't have been any more perfect.
[132:21.84]It landed right on the top of your car, but the game didn't understand.
[132:24.18]Alright, let's go.
[132:29.12]We have to go 1,000 more meters.
[132:30.44]Hey, you know, it's been 45 minutes, and we've gone 1,000 meters.
[132:33.45]We need to go another 1,500, 1,200.
[132:34.45]Ugh.
[132:40.00]This car, it ain't what it used to be, you know?
[132:43.46]Yeah, it's not.
[132:47.10]Can I hack this thing to get here faster?
[132:48.58]Alright, come to me.
[132:55.36]See, I tamed a new pet.
[132:56.62]You driving a Tesla?
[132:57.20]It's called Pickup Truck.
[132:58.32]Is that the new Tesla Pickup Truck?
[133:01.12]Goes to your remote location.
[133:02.23]I don't know what just hurt me.
[133:03.51]Something just almost killed me.
[133:05.41]Alright.
[133:07.85]Let's go, let's get even closer.
[133:16.62]Let me just equip these.
[133:18.72]Just in case I need to, you know, toss one.
[133:23.53]It's on my own car.
[133:26.71]I don't understand.
[133:27.25]Wait, I can, like, drive around with this and electrocute people.
[133:50.10]I don't understand.
[133:52.22]I'm trying to put my headphone back in.
[133:53.78]I want research points.
[134:01.02]I was trying to stick it to my... Wait, hack.
[134:08.99]Hack what?
[134:09.71]Yeah, did I know?
[134:10.37]Hack what?
[134:12.67]Pack the phone!
[134:14.48]Oh, it's a secret.
[134:15.46]It's a secret audio snippet.
[134:17.82]Some lore.
[134:18.04]Oh shit, somebody's docked on us.
[134:20.40]What do we do?
[134:20.90]Okay.
[134:21.08]Do-do-do-do-do it.
[134:21.64]Oof.
[134:22.00]Okay.
[134:47.92]I'm just casually on a phone call.
[134:49.80]Yeah, see if I can find some more hacked payphones.
[134:55.47]Get out of the way!
[134:55.87]I'm trying to take the car.
[134:56.79]Okay, this is what I wanted to do.
[135:07.90]I wanted to do this.
[135:17.67]You wanted to do what now?
[135:18.99]Equip this so I can toss it so it gets on.
[135:22.08]I need it to get on the car.
[135:23.12]Okay, it's on the car.
[135:26.98]Now I'm a traveling death machine.
[135:30.82]Jeez.
[135:31.46]Easy.
[135:31.75]Alright.
[135:33.23]I've got to find a group of people so I can just drive by them in a lefty.
[135:35.67]Traveling death machine.
[135:38.71]Yeah.
[135:38.93]See this group of people?
[135:39.79]They're like, oh, what happened to that fire?
[135:41.73]Check this.
[135:42.85]Peep this.
[135:45.73]Got him?
[135:47.63]Yeah, you did get him.
[135:48.80]I'm surprised that that actually worked.
[135:51.58]Zapped him.
[135:52.04]I can be like a traveling zap machine.
[135:53.56]Alright, let me get in your car.
[135:54.94]Pick me.
[135:58.70]Oh, the dog is like, oh shit!
[136:12.14]Don't do it!
[136:13.48]Don't...
[136:19.77]In fact, no, I need to pet him.
[136:21.21]I need to tell him that everything's going to be okay.
[136:23.17]Come here, dog.
[136:24.27]Come here.
[136:26.33]Oh, hello, doggie.
[136:27.81]Come here.
[136:28.29]Oh, yes.
[136:30.57]Oh, he's such a good boy.
[136:31.83]Oh, look at this good dog.
[136:39.36]Yes.
[136:43.11]Funny business is over.
[136:45.56]I can't kill you, but I can kill your car.
[136:49.56]Hey, what's that?
[136:50.40]Come on, try to hit me again.
[136:52.42]Hack the planet!
[136:57.34]What?
[136:57.50]Come on, I can't do it to your car.
[137:02.99]Hack the planet!
[137:06.29]I can't do anything to you.
[137:11.64]Oh, hot, hot, hot!
[137:13.40]How do you get that ability?
[137:16.59]You don't have that?
[137:17.19]I don't think so.
[137:17.83]Alright, instant six stars.
[137:22.97]Alright, let's go.
[137:24.11]I've never had six stars.
[137:26.07]Go on, get me in the fucking hole.
[137:28.52]What?
[137:29.32]I didn't get in, I guess.
[137:31.48]I tried to do something cool, go through the glass window, but it didn't work.
[137:34.98]Alright, the mission.

[140:34.07]Uh-huh.

[140:43.82]What?
[140:46.18]Okay, that guy, what was that guy even thinking?
[140:49.70]Let's be real.
[140:50.28]He was shooting at my RC car.
[140:54.06]Oh, is that what it was?
[140:56.08]Yeah.
[140:56.82]Alright, I got the door, the door's not gonna get breached, don't worry.

[141:09.83]No, it wasn't even a mission for me, bullshit.
[141:15.31]Hi guy.
[141:16.43]Hi guys that just like appeared out of nowhere.
[141:18.04]Did they just?
[141:19.04]I was wondering.
[141:19.56]There's no door over here.
[141:20.52]This guy still is holding his gun in depth.
[141:23.74]Let go dude.
[141:24.34]Let go of the gun.
[141:27.50]He won't drop it.
[141:31.34]That was good.
[141:32.00]Right outside.
[141:34.04]I'm getting some real weird lag.
[141:38.74]We can't sneak through this?
[141:42.88]Come on.
[141:43.80]Come on.
[141:44.38]There it is.
[141:45.26]We just had to move into it a bunch of times for it to work.
[141:48.36]Oh, gosh.
[141:55.17]Is this the only co-op mission in the whole game?
[141:57.29]I have to ask.
[141:58.77]I think, like, go download the data from the big box in a room is the only co-op thing to do.
[142:05.23]There's gotta be something else.
[142:07.55]This guy is still here.
[142:09.39]Don't fight him.
[142:10.83]He still hasn't noticed us.
[142:16.53]Yeah, he's getting the phone.
[142:17.93]He's checking his phone that was hovering in the air.
[142:21.13]What else we got?
[142:22.38]Give me some intel on this guy.
[142:24.62]Frequent shoes purchases.
[142:26.26]Have I leveled up yet?
[142:32.67]No.
[142:33.85]What the hell?
[142:34.67]What the heck?
[142:38.23]Enjoy those shoes, dirtbag.
[142:40.31]It's a beach.
[142:42.83]Uh-oh, they heard the gunshots.
[142:44.49]They are not happy.
[142:46.09]No, did they?
[142:47.65]Your partner is still in the area.
[142:55.41]This guy don't care.
[142:57.54]Put the gun away.
[143:00.96]He heard me.
[143:04.00]I love how he heard me put the gun away and that's like a big deal instead of a guy with a gun on a beach.
[143:08.20]Yeah.
[143:12.69]What's he doing to me?
[143:15.27]So uncalled for.
[143:16.79]Wait, we got followers for that.
[143:18.13]For killing this one.
[143:18.83]No, okay.
[143:19.31]It was something else.
[143:23.80]Dude, 70,000 followers, man.
[143:25.90]Okay.
[143:26.56]Let's do the thing that you do in Grand Theft Auto and you look at your map and you find the most likely place for the military vehicles.
[143:38.34]Like an airport or...
[143:42.74]Some kind of walled in area for the super vehicles.
[143:47.06]I want to use the yo-yo.
[143:52.78]Guy with the guitar.
[143:53.40]I'm going to look it up.
[143:55.70]I had dialog with this guy.
[143:59.40]I'm going to look it up.
[144:02.79]Why did I have dialog with that guy?
[144:04.91]Now people are coming in to fight.
[144:06.39]That guy died twice.
[144:14.56]I wish you could pick up the guitar.
[144:20.31]Enjoying the coffee.
[144:22.41]And the dog?
[144:22.95]No, I will pet the dog.
[144:24.99]I love you.
[144:28.02]That's right.
[144:29.80]Aww.
[144:30.04]I don't think you can fly helicopters.
[144:33.12]Hey, you.
[144:33.90]Hey, dog.
[144:37.46]You can't fly helicopters?
[144:38.59]I don't think so.
[144:40.35]Oh, you get me, don't you, dog?
[144:46.35]What's this guy doing?
[144:48.91]Is that a paramedic?
[144:50.27]That makes me sad.
[144:50.90]I've never seen a paramedic in this whole game.
[144:52.76]Is he going to pick everybody up?
[145:00.28]I guess so.
[145:01.32]Okay.
[145:03.66]Fine.
[145:04.12]What?
[145:04.28]Everyone is dead on this beach.
[145:17.37]Every single person is dead.
[145:19.47]I was on a small Small rampage.
[145:22.59]You sure you don't want that one little box whatever it is It's in the box.
[145:29.08]I need to see What is it paper rolls what's in there?
[145:35.89]Oh?
[145:38.59]You're just shooting the dirt right now.
[145:39.95]There's no box.
[145:41.49]There is a box.
[145:42.07]What's in it?
[145:43.63]You're in the way.
[145:45.91]It is... I have spray paint cans?
[145:51.03]What?
[145:51.63]What the hell was that lady carrying around a bunch of spray paint cans for?
[145:55.91]The hunt.
[145:56.75]Dead sack event.

[146:13.92]He's on the beach.
[146:15.38]Wait, he is on the beach.
[146:16.82]Why is this guy on the beach?
[146:18.82]I don't know.
[146:19.38]Just to taunt us, I guess?
[146:20.90]I have no idea.
[146:25.00]There was no reason for that.
[146:26.20]I'm dead.
[146:27.76]He drives on the beach just to be like, hey, in case you were wondering, I'm the mission.
[146:32.33]Is anybody curious about who the mission is?
[146:39.06]Why did all these people just drop?
[146:40.34]That was really weird.
[146:45.50]Are you chasing after that guy?
[146:46.75]I was, but I died.
[146:47.77]Alright, is there anything else we can do besides... Let's see.
[146:53.87]The same mission.

[147:11.79]Are you sure you don't want a fast mobile?
[147:13.07]Or are you going to drive the slowest ambulance in the whole game?
[147:20.09]I'd like to drive the ambulance at all, but it can't move.
[147:26.02]Seriously, it was just moving for a second.
[147:27.86]There's nothing wrong with it.
[147:30.04]Alright, I'm going to hack it and make it move.
[147:38.60]Alright, move forward.
[147:39.62]Alright, now we'll move, right?

[149:25.04]Okay.
[149:25.24]I'm on.
[149:25.76]You can move out of the way.

[150:10.12]I was going to say, just give it one moment.
[150:14.68]What is chasing me?
[150:16.46]There's a cop car up here.
[150:18.00]Where's it going?
[150:25.51]You see this police car in pursuit?
[150:27.17]I know you're about ten times faster than my electric car.
[150:30.93]Look at the minimap.
[150:31.67]What the fuck is going on right now?
[150:33.63]I got to catch up to this guy.
[150:36.98]Does anybody see this?
[150:38.14]It's going so fast for some reason.
[150:39.66]I need a faster car.
[150:40.89]What is it?
[150:42.91]What is... I need to know what that is.
[150:45.07]It's like flying around.
[150:46.09]That's not a helicopter, is it?
[150:52.42]Dude, I think that was a cop car flying in the air.
[150:57.06]Now I can catch up.
[150:59.98]It was.
[151:00.28]That was a police car.
[151:04.56]Taking a cruise through the streets to the skies.
[151:06.34]Flying.
[151:08.08]It's fucked up right now, man.
[151:10.26]It is bugged out.
[151:19.76]I want to get him moving again.
[151:22.16]There he goes.
[151:22.68]He's going your way.
[151:23.76]Wait, what?
[151:24.11]We're going to follow this guy.
[151:25.41]This police car.
[151:27.07]Follow it.
[151:27.87]I'm not even close, but I will be close in a minute.
[151:33.50]I don't even know where he's trying to go.
[151:37.43]It's very important to follow this guy.
[151:39.57]Because if he takes off into the air again, that is going to be a sight to see.
[151:43.75]I feel like that was a one-time show.
[151:47.51]What is he doing?
[151:51.41]He's having a lot of trouble.
[151:53.24]On the radar, he is currently chasing us.
[151:57.92]Why is he chasing us now?
[151:59.26]Because I fucking ran into three people.
[152:03.35]Alright.
[152:04.25]Well, as long as it wasn't my fault.
[152:06.43]No, it was my fault.
[152:08.41]He was just bugged out and I fucked it up.
[152:14.38]He was flying though.
[152:15.28]He was floating.
[152:16.36]Somehow I just couldn't catch up.
[152:17.36]Take your word for it.
[152:20.82]I'm going this way.
[152:23.50]He's just fighting.
[152:24.20]You see that?
[152:25.54]So many weird things.
[152:26.22]So many funny, weird things.
[152:27.98]Funny and weird things.
[152:32.65]So many strange and funny things.
[152:41.79]I need to keep my eye on these things, because, jeez, man, they are so fucking weird.
[152:48.18]Oh, no.
[152:49.72]Hi.
[152:50.40]He's got, like, wedged in there.
[152:51.72]Alright, here we are.
[152:57.90]Well, that's one way to land on the marker.
[152:59.52]Hurry up and get over here.
[153:01.34]Hurry up and get over here.
[153:02.56]I'm getting lit up right now.
[153:06.05]Like a hundred bullets.
[153:06.87]I pushed the button.
[153:08.53]Thank God.
[153:09.11]We're okay.
[153:10.03]We're okay.
[153:13.11]Locate the vehicle.
[153:20.04]We already have the police on us.
[153:20.98]Don't worry.
[153:22.10]I think that's gotta be a bug.
[153:24.86]The police boat.
[153:29.30]Go back that way.
[153:30.35]Get out of here.
[153:30.85]Rewind.
[153:31.89]Rewind time.
[153:33.63]Alright, this would be a lot easier if I just turned myself in.
[153:39.61]Hey, how did you die?
[153:41.67]I didn't.
[153:42.23]Why does it say you've been neutralized?
[153:45.55]The cops are now off.
[153:48.10]Huh?
[153:50.18]Nothing happened.
[153:50.68]Oh no, I pulled out my gun.
[153:53.82]I got neutralized?
[153:55.52]Yes.
[153:56.24]Am I standing next to you?
[153:58.71]I just got neutralized.
[153:59.61]I'm back and the cops are still on me.
[154:01.55]No.
[154:02.85]Yeah, look at this fucking boat.
[154:05.45]Do you have a star at the bottom left?
[154:07.83]No, it says I'm escaping.
[154:10.79]Well, now you're going to have a star.
[154:12.05]We need to unglitch these things.
[154:14.51]They were fine just a second ago.
[154:17.12]Trust me, they weren't.
[154:20.98]Just get into the building.
[154:30.86]It's a restricted area.
[154:31.88]Watch out for the bad guys.
[154:32.85]Hey, there's a money bag in here.
[154:40.87]I like how this has become the shooter game.
[154:48.25]We have not hacked.
[154:49.69]We have not hacked one thing that we're supposed to hack.
[154:52.34]Here we have.
[154:54.44]I mean to get to the point.
[154:59.12]We need to open this door.
[155:01.44]Hold on.
[155:02.70]I'll get on it.
[155:04.94]You need to hack the garage door.
[155:07.99]Get him quick!
[155:09.89]Shit, I was trying to pull my gun out.
[155:12.81]Hold on, I'll get it.
[155:14.99]I'll take care of this.
[155:17.72]What's this police officer doing?
[155:23.18]He just came in and left.
[155:25.76]I can't.
[155:30.02]Dude, I can't.
[155:32.59]Okay, I did the thing.
[155:34.77]You hacked it?
[155:35.23]Alright, can we leave?
[155:36.21]I need to get in the boat first.
[155:39.14]Alright, get in quick.
[155:42.98]Hurry.
[155:43.58]Hurry.
[155:44.60]I'm getting lit up.
[155:45.76]I'm getting lit up.
[155:48.00]Escape the pursuers.
[155:49.04]Alright.
[155:52.12]Is that a pursuer?
[155:55.65]Probably.
[155:58.63]Where's the dog washing simulator?
[156:00.39]We have to go all the way down there.
[156:08.78]I had to just do that.
[156:09.60]There's a sailboat.
[156:10.50]What do you expect?
[156:11.82]Are you taking care of the cops on us?
[156:13.49]Uh, maybe?
[156:14.79]It's kind of hard, you know.
[156:18.53]Why can they go much faster?
[156:20.39]Why?
[156:20.53]They're going like three times fast.
[156:23.41]So are they trying to like do a pit maneuver in the boat?
[156:28.27]I don't know.
[156:30.62]The vehicle's going to break down.
[156:31.46]You seriously have to kill these guys.
[156:32.66]Shoot through the windows.
[156:35.86]It's not as easy as it looks.
[156:38.15]Ah, it zoomed way in.
[156:39.87]Okay, forget the boat, there's a helicopter in pursuit right now.
[156:44.13]It's alright, we're at the mission end.
[156:45.65]Just gonna park the boat riiiight here.
[156:52.09]Uh, come on!
[156:55.31]Objective failed.
[156:56.89]Explain that to me again.
[156:58.03]Uh... It's smoking?
[157:01.01]Maybe because it's a smoky boat?
[157:03.67]We didn't just pull in and have that happen.
[157:05.85]Yeah!
[157:07.63]yeah we I was in there yeah long loading screen yeah um of a skeleton I'm with it with an axe yeah well well well I wonder if we'll have the police on us no we don't
[157:35.57]So we can actually attempt the mission just one time.
[157:39.83]Without immediately being drawn into a gunfight.
[157:44.63]Even after me dying twice.
[157:49.76]Let's do this stealthy.
[157:53.24]You got me.
[157:53.96]You got me.
[157:54.92]Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak.
[157:57.10]Get out your stun gun.

[158:08.18]Nice work.
[158:08.62]Oh yeah.
[158:09.56]Oh yeah.

[158:28.97]I can throw a neutralization grenade over there.
[158:31.03]No, I closed it.
[158:31.93]Open it, please.
[158:36.20]Let's go ahead and throw one of my neutralization grenades in there.
[158:38.90]We'll be all set.
[158:41.78]Hmm.
[158:50.38]Neutralized.
[158:50.90]Hmm.
[158:55.40]Neutralized.
[158:55.90]There goes one.
[158:57.64]Uh oh.
[159:01.17]Oh, they're on the lookout.
[159:01.91]It's alright.
[159:03.39]I'm going to stun gun this guy.
[159:04.39]Stun gunning in one, two, three.
[159:06.47]Not far.
[159:07.09]Too far away.
[159:09.26]Stunning.
[159:09.80]Flanking.
[159:10.64]Consecrating.
[159:11.32]Flanking.
[159:12.66]Stunning.
[159:13.04]One, two, three.
[159:15.58]Stunned.
[159:17.02]Who else has left?
[159:17.56]Anybody else?
[159:19.76]We got it.
[159:21.22]Hack.
[159:21.66]Silent mission.
[159:22.24]Congratulations.
[159:23.76]I'll get this PC CD-ROM.
[159:27.91]Got it.
[159:29.11]Any more PCs?
[159:32.53]Dealing with them.
[159:35.75]Where's that last PC?
[159:36.41]What is that?
[159:41.27]Pick up.
[159:41.85]Oh.
[159:42.93]Give it to me.
[159:45.07]Easy.
[159:47.75]We actually did a mission without getting caught.
[159:50.09]Alright.
[159:50.59]Now we can go back to losing at the game and failing.
[159:53.73]Like usual.
[159:54.31]Why do they have to do a front flip to jump into the water?
[160:04.20]Because it looks cool, man.
[160:09.03]See what happens when you actually try.
[160:11.71]We put in a tiny bit of effort.
[160:14.01]We put in a small amount of effort.
[160:15.45]We were doing collars.
[160:16.43]Alright, you know, Etalyx.
[160:18.81]Yeah.
[160:19.07]Here.
[160:19.51]What?
[160:19.89]I want the sailboat.
[160:20.87]You can take this thing back.
[160:21.91]I'll just follow you.
[160:22.66]I want the sailboat.
[160:24.76]I want to drive the sailboat.
[160:26.28]Mm-hmm.
[160:29.86]So... Hold on.
[160:31.14]Let me help.
[160:31.68]Take this thing back to HQ.
[160:33.46]She's getting away.
[160:35.52]She's getting away, huh?
[160:38.15]Alright, bring me... Slow down, slow down.
[160:45.27]Good luck, like, getting off.
[160:46.63]There you go.
[160:46.93]Alright, this is gonna be fun.
[160:48.99]I've always wanted the sailboat.
[160:49.85]Yep, just get on the slowest aquatic craft.
[160:54.47]There's no sails.
[160:55.49]Oh, there they are.
[160:59.25]Now you've got sails.
[161:03.10]You know how bad I want to just try to ram that sailboat with this?
[161:07.84]But I don't want to fail the mission and do it all over again.
[161:11.74]People are still looking for us, by the way.
[161:16.46]How do sailboats work again?
[161:19.14]Usually you need like a crew, don't you?
[161:23.24]This isn't like the 1500s.
[161:24.12]Yeah, you need like a full crew to hoist the sail and match the speed.
[161:31.55]Get out of the vehicle.
[161:34.02]Alright.
[161:34.50]Oh, there we go.
[161:35.02]I can see in the lower left.
[161:36.30]Did we do it?
[161:38.68]Yeah, I got it.
[161:39.74]I got some more followers.
[161:40.66]Only 15k?
[161:41.72]I want another upgrade.
[161:42.69]I can't.
[161:46.11]I got to go with the wind.
[161:49.09]New mission.
[161:51.17]New mission.
[161:51.85]Oh.
[161:52.33]Blood money.
[161:53.89]Steely encrypted drives.
[161:56.67]Alright.
[161:57.29]The ones with the most follower counts.
[161:58.54]These ones.
[161:59.34]Free the dead sick prisoner from the Tezcas.
[162:01.76]Okay.
[162:02.42]I just marked it.
[162:04.24]Where are you?
[162:07.12]I wanna get off this dumb sailboat.
[162:09.40]Alright, this is the one.
[162:10.10]Free the prisoner.
[162:11.96]Yeah.
[162:12.48]We gotta go a long ways away.
[162:13.94]Yeah, because you're in a sailboat.
[162:16.00]Yeah, I'm getting off the sailboat.
[162:17.44]Because you're in a sailboat.
[162:19.78]I know.
[162:20.00]I'm gonna climb this and get on here.
[162:21.98]You gotta come pick me up.
[162:22.78]I'm on the giant metal arm.
[162:25.22]In the middle of the ocean for no reason.
[162:26.40]I'm in a car!
[162:27.08]How am I gonna get to you?
[162:29.38]I'm not in a boat anymore.
[162:30.40]You're gonna have to pick me up.
[162:32.38]Seriously.
[162:34.73]Really?
[162:37.03]Kind of.
[162:37.69]Really?
[162:39.36]We reached a new division in our leaderboard.
[162:43.50]Can I fast travel?
[162:44.44]I might be able to, actually.
[162:45.26]Hold on.
[162:46.60]Yeah, I can.
[162:47.12]Don't worry about me.
[162:48.40]Hold on.
[162:51.66]I'm fast traveling to the mission.
[162:52.99]Fast travel to where we need to go.
[162:54.51]Yeah, I just skipped everything.
[162:57.31]What?
[162:59.23]Fast travel all the way to the left where we need to go.
[163:01.41]Bottom left.
[163:02.91]You'll see it.
[163:03.83]Is it blood money?
[163:06.35]It's the one where we have to free the prisoner.
[163:09.37]Bottom left?
[163:12.05]It's taking a long time to load.
[163:17.92]How do you fast travel?
[163:21.24]You have to hover over a... It's really dumb.
[163:23.86]You have to hover over a clothing shop.
[163:28.05]The police are currently trying to take me out.
[163:29.67]Alright, well, don't worry.
[163:32.01]Okay, you need to go to... Give me the address so I can put it in Google Maps.
[163:36.84]Street Flex or... I can't see it because... Axle Board Shop.
[163:41.98]I kind of don't want to lose this vehicle.
[163:45.44]Even though it's stupid.
[163:46.44]I'll be inside.
[163:47.08]I'll be in the store taking a tinkle.
[163:50.28]I'll be right back, guys.
[163:50.98]Oh, no.
[163:51.12]No.
[163:51.26]Not ready yet.
[163:51.90]No, I gotta pee.
[163:52.74]I have to pee.
[163:57.58]Not like that.
[163:59.30]Not like this.
[164:01.94]You have to get... I'm all the way... I'm already here.
[164:04.02]Could have already peed by now, Jerma.
[164:06.20]People are waiting.
[164:09.18]Yeah.
[164:10.20]Oh, thank you, Cronus415, for subscribing to Jerma985.
[164:12.96]Really appreciate that.
[164:14.30]Oh, you didn't think I knew.
[164:17.72]Didn't think I knew.
[164:31.31]Alright, guys, seriously, I'm not going to laugh at anything because you can't see what I'm laughing at.
[164:40.69]So shut up.
[164:41.35]Alright, pop quiz, guys, who made this game, Ubisoft or EA?
[164:50.88]Hi, Humgee, it's Matt.
[164:52.20]How are you?
[164:54.32]That's right, I can see your stupid chat.
[164:55.86]You guys even know how to type anything besides memes?
[165:00.58]Probably not.
[165:06.53]Alright, I think I'm here.
[165:07.83]I'm in my smart car.
[165:08.71]I'm here.
[165:09.05]Who just... Hold on.
[165:09.93]Oh yeah, here come the memes.
[165:12.12]Here come the memes.
[165:36.39]How far away?
[165:37.81]Oh, Jerma's over here.
[165:39.27]Alright guys, what should I do?
[165:40.88]To surprise him when he gets back.
[165:47.96]I don't have any explosives, so my options are a little bit limited.
[165:51.10]I must confess.
[165:51.78]Alright chat, we have to work together now.
[166:00.98]Is there a way to repair cars in this game?
[166:03.08]Is there a way?
[166:06.54]I need to know.
[166:09.18]Block him in?
[166:09.96]What, with vehicles?
[166:12.30]He can just climb over them.
[166:16.23]Oh, he's inside of a shop.
[166:19.15]Oh, you didn't mention that.
[166:20.33]Okay.
[166:23.87]Uh-oh.
[166:28.62]Nobody call the cops, right?
[166:31.74]No one call the cops.
[166:33.62]Uh-oh.
[166:39.83]Weren't supposed to be back already.
[166:41.21]I'm not supposed to be back already?
[166:43.43]Were you gonna plan something?
[166:46.17]I didn't even zip up my pants.
[166:47.31]I'm not kidding.
[166:49.47]My pants are still unzipped.
[166:51.59]I peed and just like... I peed and then buttoned my jeans and came down the stairs.
[166:56.05]Who cares?
[166:57.23]Was like a mom gonna walk in?
[167:00.39]Was my wife gonna come in here?
[167:01.97]Nope.
[167:03.03]It's just me, baby.
[167:03.99]I can do whatever I want.
[167:07.93]I actually did not mean to punch that guy in the face.
[167:12.12]He's not happy about it.
[167:13.66]I picked the controller back up.
[167:20.10]That was pretty elaborate.
[167:22.13]Extremely elaborate insult.
[167:24.59]Too bad it got you nowhere.
[167:25.79]I'd like to buy some clothes now, please.
[167:30.97]Are you ready?
[167:32.03]I'm trying to shop.
[167:34.57]Let's take a look at glasses.
[167:37.89]Where do we go for glasses?
[167:39.25]These are expensive.
[167:40.39]I like these ones.
[167:40.92]I don't even care.
[167:42.62]These ones?
[167:43.08]Oh, no, you don't.
[167:57.01]I was hoping he was going to fucking fight me.
[167:58.75]I see you in like a... What are you in out there?
[168:02.78]These pants all suck.
[168:13.58]What are you trying to do?
[168:15.14]Nothing.
[168:20.80]I don't understand what you're doing.
[168:22.10]Nothing.
[168:22.90]I'm trying to buy funny clothes.
[168:27.81]I like these.
[168:28.25]$345 for a pair of pants.
[168:30.51]Get fucking out of here.
[168:36.02]What did I do?
[168:38.74]Oh.
[168:39.70]Come on.
[168:40.60]No, what the fuck is... I don't want to open up like a... I don't want to buy shit.
[168:49.37]God, come on.
[168:53.25]Tops, no.
[168:54.39]Plain stock.
[168:56.19]No.
[168:56.49]No.
[169:01.64]I'm just keeping these on.
[169:02.62]I don't care.
[169:03.54]Oh, thanks, Aurelius.
[169:05.08]Oh, no, I'm doing a bad job.
[169:07.38]Piss.
[169:09.98]What the hell are you doing?
[169:11.76]Are these bowling balls?
[169:14.82]No, these are helmets.
[169:16.88]I thought they were bowling balls.
[169:21.15]What else can I buy in here?
[169:24.05]I don't think I can buy anything else.
[169:25.13]Can I hack the phone?
[169:30.60]Game sucks.
[169:31.24]Come on.
[169:32.36]Here we go.
[169:32.58]I'm sorry.
[169:33.54]I had... I tried so hard, chat.
[169:36.07]What were you trying to do?
[169:37.49]I tried to box you in, but you see this little... Look up.
[169:40.07]You see this thing right here?
[169:41.65]This little awning?
[169:43.81]Yeah.
[169:45.13]There's another door.
[169:46.74]There's a back door.
[169:50.52]There is a backdoor.
[169:52.16]There's a backdoor.
[169:56.40]Hey, this is the guy that was really mad at me and punched me a couple times.
[169:58.82]Deal with him.
[169:59.40]Do something about it, Etalyx.
[170:01.08]Be a true friend.
[170:03.51]Not true enough.
[170:04.23]Fucking punched me in a shop again.
[170:12.07]The whole side door is a backdoor.
[170:15.12]These people are fighting.
[170:16.38]Last time I listened to your chat.
[170:18.37]Did that guy punch him?
[170:20.05]I think that guy just punched that lady.
[170:21.68]I'm just going to let myself die.
[170:25.12]Yeah, probably.
[170:26.46]Five stars.
[170:26.96]Too many.
[170:27.22]It's a hacking game.
[170:27.78]Of course there's a back door.
[170:28.92]Alright, let's go.
[170:31.62]Mission time.
[170:33.96]I'm on my way to the mission.
[170:37.69]I'm going to make it.
[170:40.11]Let's explode it.
[170:43.39]Haha.
[170:50.46]Well, I just got screwed.
[170:56.11]It would have worked, Etalyx, but Jerma didn't wash his hands, so he came back too fast.
[171:08.43]Can I have that, please?
[171:11.43]They get out of the car so calmly and then sprint away.
[171:15.84]Wait, are you over there by the mission?
[171:16.84]Yeah.
[171:27.77]I am.
[171:28.15]Alright, we're gonna rescue... There's apparently like a hostage in here or something that we know.
[171:41.22]Hold on, I'm getting there.
[171:42.90]Almost there.
[171:44.28]Yeah, that's why I built for death.
[171:47.52]Built for death.
[171:52.58]That's so bouncy.
[171:55.13]You want a reliable truck with good gas mileage that can go over tough terrain?
[172:00.19]I'll get a Ford.
[172:01.67]I just built a Ford, too.
[172:07.07]You want a car that can go on the beach?
[172:08.67]That's a Ford.
[172:09.99]I just built a Ford, too.
[172:14.13]Is that what it said?
[172:14.87]Pavement?
[172:16.33]It's water.
[172:16.99]This is a huge wave.
[172:22.24]What a gigantic wave.
[172:23.54]Why am I talking like this?
[172:25.58]Wow.
[172:33.38]I don't even know what you're on.
[172:34.90]But these dogs are like barking at each other.
[172:36.82]Come on, dude.
[172:38.31]What's with you and the dog?
[172:40.03]That's like the third dog that you've killed.
[172:43.23]Not cool.
[172:45.25]Stop murdering my dog friends.
[172:47.15]Even though they're both the same exact dog.
[172:49.27]I'm too crazy.
[172:55.47]No!
[172:56.75]No!
[172:58.55]Get away from him.
[173:00.39]Get away from him.
[173:01.85]See, if I pet him, you can't do it.
[173:07.80]See?
[173:11.16]Yeah, my dog friend got away.
[173:17.31]Why do I get so much air out of that?
[173:21.39]No, did I do that?
[173:22.07]I don't think I did.
[173:22.81]You did.
[173:23.17]I didn't hit him.
[173:23.61]No, I didn't.
[173:23.97]You did.
[173:24.29]I did not.
[173:24.69]You fucking hit him.
[173:25.51]No.
[173:25.97]I did not do that.
[173:26.83]You shot him.
[173:28.49]I went right by him.
[173:31.23]Yep.
[173:32.29]You killed him.
[173:33.72]Shh, don't say that.
[173:38.10]You murderer.
[173:42.68]Alright, what are we supposed to do?
[173:45.26]We have to go rescue the... There's a hostage in this building.
[173:50.29]Ugh.
[173:52.86]Avoid detection until freeing the target.
[173:54.40]Well, that's... Good luck.
[173:56.54]Good luck.
[173:57.07]Hey, you want to already fail the mission?
[173:58.55]He's this way.
[173:58.99]He's the other way.
[174:02.71]Unless there's a tunnel we have to go through.
[174:05.39]Oh, I see.
[174:07.56]I saw the guy in the head!
[174:10.34]He already saw me.
[174:11.68]It doesn't matter.
[174:12.82]But that was optional.
[174:14.58]That was optional.
[174:15.24]Who cares?
[174:15.98]I thought we had to go that way.
[174:18.26]Wait, dude, avoid detection.
[174:19.84]Yeah, that's just like the bonus points.
[174:21.98]We probably get like super bonus points.
[174:24.42]Uh oh, I got detected too.
[174:26.50]Yeah, but my point is that why the fuck does it matter what those guys back there care about?
[174:30.62]I don't know.
[174:32.10]These people didn't detect us.
[174:33.10]The guy back there did.
[174:33.94]That was on a balcony.
[174:36.09]Well, this just became the Call of Duty level.
[174:44.59]Running gun, man.
[174:45.19]That's the way to do it.
[174:46.09]Pull out the shotgun.
[174:49.25]Where's the device being locked into?
[174:51.65]Is that our guy in there?
[174:53.91]Yep.
[174:56.27]Not sure how you hack a vent grate, but there you go.
[175:01.93]Get that open and I'm going to get our boys and girls out of here.
[175:05.74]Reinforcements have been called.
[175:07.82]I'll protect you.
[175:08.90]Keep the good fight going.
[175:09.70]My teammate was detected.
[175:12.57]The reinforcements have no idea what's going on.
[175:22.93]We're in.
[175:23.19]I have to reload the fucking shotgun.
[175:25.49]We're in.
[175:27.35]We're in.
[175:28.58]We're in.
[175:29.44]Nice.
[175:32.61]No one else is in here for some reason.
[175:34.41]I thought that was our person lying down there.
[175:42.73]Anything else?
[175:47.01]I just saw Crash Bandicoot, and I thought there was some weird Easter egg in the game.
[175:51.28]That's your avatar.
[175:52.70]Oh, yeah.
[175:55.88]Oh, shit.
[175:56.72]You didn't hack it.
[175:58.00]Forgot to hack it.
[176:00.19]Where are we even going the right?
[176:01.37]He's underneath.
[176:02.26]He's underneath.
[176:03.54]We gotta go down.
[176:07.80]Wait, there's a door.
[176:10.30]We gotta hack the door through the system.
[176:11.82]Wait, hold on.
[176:12.44]Don't even need to hack the door.
[176:13.18]Are you serious?
[176:13.74]Watch this.
[176:14.26]Easy.
[176:15.57]Don't even need to hack the door.
[176:16.43]Did they just open it for you?
[176:19.23]No, I did it.
[176:19.81]I hacked it.
[176:20.79]I got some hacking skills.
[176:23.45]My hack was, yeah, letting them... Okay, can I kill that dog?
[176:29.26]No.
[176:30.04]Did you just kill that dog?
[176:32.58]I whacked it.
[176:34.16]I gave it a whack.
[176:35.10]How do we go down?
[176:36.08]I'm going to find that out.
[176:42.62]Here?
[176:42.80]Yeah, it's here.
[176:51.76]Stop killing dogs.
[176:52.28]I don't want to do that.
[176:53.34]I don't want to do that.
[176:54.24]I have to so we don't die.
[176:55.40]There he is.
[176:58.45]There's our guy.
[177:01.33]He's still wearing his beanie.
[177:07.59]Can I level up yet?
[177:08.73]That's what I keep wondering.
[177:11.95]That's what I want to know.
[177:17.89]Yeah, you're the hack guy.
[177:20.05]I like you in that role.
[177:21.15]There's like 30 people outside this door, by the way.
[177:23.43]Really?
[177:24.97]Oh, yeah.
[177:25.61]Don't worry.
[177:25.91]I got it.
[177:28.61]Gosh dang it.
[177:29.11]I went backwards.
[177:31.93]You open the door?
[177:32.41]How do you open the door?
[177:35.49]You need to hack it.
[177:36.19]Yeah, but like, it's red.
[177:38.73]Find the access key.
[177:39.67]Find the access key.
[177:40.41]That's what I'm trying to do.
[177:42.86]It's up there.
[177:43.98]See it?
[177:44.40]Yep.
[177:45.10]Wait, hold on, Ken.
[177:45.74]They're coming in behind us.
[177:47.22]I think I can do it from here.
[177:48.22]What?
[177:49.26]What the fuck?
[177:49.74]It's a guy?
[177:50.24]It's a guy's head.
[177:50.80]You're gonna hack a guy's brain?
[177:54.40]How do you get up there?
[177:55.68]Are you using the cameras?
[177:56.31]What is this, Professor X?
[177:58.32]Yeah, I was just using the key.
[177:59.02]We gotta go back up the stairs.
[178:00.22]Apparently there's like a mutant up there.
[178:03.40]Alright, well there's a guy on the other side of this door.
[178:07.68]Why is it not hurting him?
[178:11.80]He's just running away from us.
[178:22.54]He's apparently like here.
[178:24.49]Isn't he like right up here somewhere?
[178:26.59]Upstairs?
[178:28.70]How do we get upstairs?
[178:29.90]He's this way, isn't he?
[178:32.45]No, he's up.
[178:34.13]How do we get up?
[178:36.37]There's two.
[178:37.01]There's two different ones.
[178:37.83]There's one over there, and there's one over here.
[178:40.27]This guy's already dead, I'm pretty sure.
[178:42.19]Yeah, but we have to, like, take the implants out of his brain.
[178:45.97]There, I got one.
[178:47.38]You got it?
[178:47.70]Oh, yeah, that's what I needed.
[178:50.08]Come back down.
[178:56.27]I actually fell down.
[178:56.89]You didn't know.
[178:57.35]You were playing Deus Ex.
[178:58.37]I fucking fell.
[178:59.77]I just like dripped.
[179:03.22]The guy keeps tripping.
[179:07.98]Get him.
[179:11.96]I wanted to shoot him so bad.
[179:16.36]What?
[179:17.16]What?
[179:22.08]I knew what the joke was.
[179:23.46]No, I thought it was impossible.
[179:25.30]And I didn't think you could do it.
[179:27.23]But look, you can't.
[179:29.09]I didn't think it was possible.
[179:30.43]I knew what the joke was because I was thinking the exact same thing.
[179:33.65]No, you can't do it.
[179:35.41]Look, there's a little X over the crosshair.
[179:37.98]Can't kill the quest objective.
[179:42.46]I didn't think it was actually possible.
[179:44.46]Oh, hope you all enjoyed that mission because we get to do it again now.
[179:49.59]I didn't... Oh, you gotta give me some credit here.
[179:52.27]There's an... You guys did not think that was possible.
[179:54.55]I didn't.
[179:54.93]He didn't.
[179:55.79]Nobody didn't.
[179:56.29]In either chat, the X was there.
[179:58.25]Break the game.
[179:58.87]I just... I fucked it up.
[180:00.23]I messed up the game.
[180:00.98]Shotgun spread.
[180:01.28]I shot like a little dude was left.
[180:03.00]I shotgun spread, shot him in his back and killed him.
[180:05.54]Alright, don't get detected.
[180:07.68]We already got detected.
[180:11.91]Okay, don't get detected.
[180:13.31]What the fuck is she doing?
[180:15.97]Get out of here.
[180:16.67]That was the most brutal death I think I've seen.
[180:23.45]Go, alright, at least this time hack this guy.
[180:26.20]Get his key card.
[180:27.74]Got the key card.
[180:28.48]Alright, here's a snowmobile and get down there.
[180:33.66]Gotta go through the vent again.
[180:42.65]Why are they not getting electrocuted?
[180:46.34]They just blew up my RC car and you're dead.
[180:49.94]And you're dead.
[180:51.34]Why weren't they getting electrocuted?
[180:52.82]I have an electro zapper field.
[180:54.38]I'm just gonna die.
[180:57.40]There.
[180:58.65]Start over.
[180:59.61]Third time, guys.
[181:01.23]Third time.
[181:07.63]Don't get detected.
[181:09.13]Don't get detected.
[181:13.40]Why is it loading?
[181:16.80]Gotta set up all the dominoes so we can knock him over again.
[181:20.58]No, but, okay, let's, I'm gonna break down the last two things that happened to Etalyx.
[181:23.94]Yeah.
[181:25.04]So, that last time, I had a charge that was going.
[181:28.46]They were inside the charge and they were just looking at me.
[181:31.69]It's a stun EMP field.
[181:35.35]Alright, don't get, let's actually try not to get detected.
[181:39.89]We probably shouldn't be standing here.
[181:41.19]Okay, they can't see me yet.
[181:42.39]Hold on.
[181:45.36]Sorry, I'm gonna... Where's like a thing we can hack?
[181:48.76]I got it under control.
[181:50.98]Okay.
[181:52.58]Hacking the cameras.
[181:56.81]Not good enough.
[181:57.51]How did we kill her the first time around?
[181:58.95]She was not just standing out here, was she?
[182:03.57]I think you can stun him.
[182:06.15]Stun, I don't think, attracts anybody.
[182:08.55]That doesn't count.
[182:09.59]But you have to be close enough, which I don't think we are.
[182:12.51]Booyah now.
[182:14.15]Should I go for it?
[182:16.49]Oh yeah, she turned around.
[182:21.72]Alright, distract her so you can take her out.
[182:24.66]You want to shoot her?
[182:25.34]No, you can melee take her down.
[182:28.38]I don't want to get up that far.
[182:29.18]When you see that phone vibrating icon above her head, you can take her down.
[182:32.52]Alright, ready?
[182:33.12]3, 2, 1, go.
[182:34.64]Do it!
[182:35.74]Do it!
[182:36.26]Do it!
[182:36.50]Do it!
[182:37.76]Go!
[182:38.58]Sprint!
[182:39.38]Run!
[182:39.94]No!
[182:40.30]No!
[182:40.65]No!
[182:40.85]Sprint!
[182:41.03]Sprint!
[182:43.42]There you go.
[182:44.32]You got it.
[182:44.76]Easy.
[182:45.64]Easy.
[182:46.05]I thought there was like two guys that were going to be coming out here.
[182:48.17]They're like in the door.
[182:49.05]Now let me try this.
[182:49.79]Now watch this.
[182:50.21]Here we go.
[182:51.89]This should work this time.
[182:52.93]Hold on.
[182:53.62]Hold on.
[182:54.96]Fuck me in my face.
[182:55.94]Wait for it.
[182:58.92]Hold on.
[183:02.30]What are you trying to do?
[183:04.52]I was trying to throw my projectile one got stuck in the ceiling was Let's just look at you know what we're just gonna.
[183:10.61]We're just gonna let this happen because I Apparently am too stupid to do that Give me a break in the room like look at this It was like I was aiming like this and it threw it like down here.
[183:22.86]Oh
[183:26.41]I can't aim it from here.
[183:28.69]It's not possible.
[183:29.85]Check this out.
[183:31.07]It's impossible.
[183:34.15]This is going to be reloaded in a second.
[183:36.85]Watch this.
[183:37.17]Ready?
[183:39.55]I can't do it from here.
[183:41.55]It's either too low or too high.
[183:45.08]Don't make fun of me.
[183:47.42]I hacked the person's phone.
[183:50.96]I just took money.
[183:51.64]That's all I did.
[183:54.25]I said the person's phone.
[183:57.03]Yeah, you have that option, not me.
[183:58.33]That's your class.
[183:59.05]It's what happens when you like L1X.
[184:02.22]Actually, L1X was take money.
[184:04.30]And that's your class.
[184:05.74]You're the tech.
[184:06.26]What?
[184:06.58]I'm the DPS.
[184:09.04]There's not classes?
[184:10.60]Yes, there is.
[184:11.02]You didn't pick one at the very beginning?
[184:12.28]No.
[184:14.30]There's no classes in this game, you troll.
[184:17.52]Teammate was detected.
[184:18.56]Good.
[184:19.74]I didn't...
[184:21.47]Good.
[184:22.13]Honestly, I'm just getting fucking real tired of standing around, so I'll give you the shotgun.
[184:25.21]Who cares?
[184:30.03]It's gonna be like an extra $12.
[184:31.89]You want like an extra $12, Etalyx?
[184:35.87]Hey, you're the one who said you want to level up.
[184:37.25]I don't care.
[184:44.85]Alright, let me do all the handiwork.
[184:47.73]You do it.
[184:48.79]I told you, you're the tech guy.
[184:50.83]See?
[184:51.23]I'm the guy that makes sure we get a fucking damage round.
[184:57.87]Wait, isn't it the other way?
[185:01.27]I think so.
[185:07.74]Alright, I promise not to shoot this guy.
[185:10.24]Shoot the dog, though.
[185:12.78]No, do not shoot the dog.
[185:14.34]Fine, I'll beat it with the yo-yo.
[185:15.90]Teammate was detected.
[185:17.36]By a dog.
[185:18.10]What is it, communicating with everyone else?
[185:20.72]Does it have its own radio?
[185:25.70]Why is there a bad guy in here?
[185:28.04]Alright, this time we're not gonna shoot you in the calf.
[185:31.83]Oh dear.
[185:33.39]It's not even over.
[185:34.47]Like, we can still accidentally kill him.
[185:36.63]Where is he going?
[185:41.73]What is he doing?
[185:42.76]He's aiming at the ceiling.
[185:45.92]I think this guy might also be on drugs.
[185:52.98]Will he follow us?
[185:57.74]He looks stuck.
[186:02.19]Yeah, he's not moving.
[186:04.93]Both players must leave the area.
[186:06.97]I don't think we have to escort him.
[186:08.49]I think we just run.
[186:08.99]We don't have to escort him.
[186:11.27]Okay.
[186:14.54]Who just killed that guy?
[186:17.66]Who just killed that guy?
[186:18.78]The door opened and a person who you can't see got shot and died.
[186:26.22]Is he shooting people through the floor?
[186:35.91]I don't understand.
[186:36.51]I don't know what's happening.
[186:39.51]Where are they shooting this guy from?
[186:42.99]He just got hit.
[186:45.00]He's got his magnets in his ceiling.
[186:49.20]Yeah, well he's apparently shooting at this person.
[186:51.12]Do you see this dead body on the other side of this door right here?
[186:55.12]I didn't kill this person.
[186:56.10]I don't understand.
[186:57.56]Is he dead?
[187:03.20]Is he dead?
[187:03.68]Please tell me he's not dead.
[187:05.30]No, he's just standing here.
[187:07.32]Stop standing there.
[187:09.18]And move, man.
[187:10.45]Please don't be dead.
[187:12.37]He's just fucking standing there.
[187:15.07]He's gonna get destroyed.
[187:22.77]I love this guy.
[187:27.08]He's just cluelessly in the hallway.
[187:29.72]Oh, there's a bunch of people in here.
[187:35.18]No, no, no, no.
[187:35.82]Not like this.
[187:38.22]Why do we not like this?
[187:39.12]I don't want to die and reset the whole mission.
[187:43.27]Here he is.
[187:44.27]Come on out, man.
[187:44.99]I just want to make sure there's nobody in through the walls to shoot anymore.
[187:48.51]I got your back.
[187:52.55]Looks like tracksuit that he's got on.
[187:54.17]Anybody in this wall?
[187:59.87]Captain.
[188:02.95]Hey, by the way, the second we complete this mission, I'm running this guy over.
[188:06.32]Okay.
[188:09.00]Where is he?
[188:09.36]I'm going to make sure he stays with us.
[188:16.22]He's still in here.
[188:17.72]He's fighting people that appeared.
[188:19.36]I think he's almost dead.
[188:27.45]I just need to know what happens to this guy.
[188:29.63]Point blank.
[188:30.29]This guy can't die.
[188:31.79]I have left the area.
[188:34.75]He's a little further of a jog than you might initially think.
[188:38.03]Oh, shit, he is.
[188:42.90]But our friend.
[188:44.06]We can't leave our friend.
[188:48.05]No... No, go track him down.
[188:52.27]We both have to leave the area.
[188:54.39]I know.
[188:54.81]Oh, fuck.
[188:55.29]You're right.
[188:55.91]Ah, fuck.
[188:59.37]Oh, no.
[188:59.93]He's in conflict.
[189:02.07]We're almost out.
[189:02.71]We're almost out.
[189:03.65]Okay, escape the pursuers.
[189:05.15]There are no pursuers.
[189:05.99]That car right there?
[189:10.18]That car, that car that just came out of a Christopher Lloyd time flex.
[189:16.39]What other car?
[189:16.95]The other one.
[189:18.17]Alright, good.
[189:21.95]Alright, two down.
[189:23.31]There's a third one coming up down that same road.
[189:28.59]What car?
[189:29.65]The one two feet away from you.
[189:31.81]No, it wasn't there.
[189:33.13]There's another car?
[189:34.09]It wasn't there.
[189:35.52]Shoot this guy.
[189:37.14]Shoot this guy.
[189:40.47]They're fucking everywhere.
[189:42.37]Get in the truck.
[189:46.32]Oh my god.
[189:47.06]Game.
[189:48.14]Game.
[189:50.44]Why game?
[189:52.24]Alright.
[189:53.84]Making my getaway.
[189:55.88]Only got four exclamations.
[190:01.76]And a flat tire.
[190:03.51]Alright, let me get in your car.
[190:05.69]I don't get in my car.
[190:06.43]I have a loud car.
[190:09.63]You don't want to get in the loud car, trust me.
[190:14.57]Nope, they're just appearing and driving straight at us.
[190:17.82]So just like Grand Theft Auto.
[190:20.64]Okay, avoid the pursuers.
[190:26.57]It's kind of hard to do that when you spawn them in front of us.
[190:32.03]Driving in a straight line and they just happen to be there.
[190:36.30]I think that guy on the left was also one of those people, too.
[190:38.77]Uh, they're gaining on me because of my flat tires.
[190:46.39]Alright, you're escaping.
[190:47.69]I'm not.
[190:49.79]Well, now I'm not.
[190:53.46]I need a faster car.
[190:56.48]If you see a sports car, take it.
[191:01.38]I'm willing to hurt myself.
[191:02.78]I'm willing to get killed to get out of this car.
[191:09.40]Don't get in the little shit, Beetle.
[191:17.16]Teammate was detected.
[191:18.20]Yep.
[191:19.86]Having some difficult... Because now it's a stealth mission still.
[191:22.96]No.
[191:23.28]Not really.
[191:32.18]Jeez, man.
[191:35.92]I don't know how to escape.
[191:39.41]Did you escape?
[191:40.07]Because I think I took the heat off of you.
[191:41.55]No, I have full stars.
[191:43.57]Yeah, me too.
[191:44.25]There's nobody around me.
[191:47.43]Okay, now I'm starting to escape.
[191:50.91]I guess.
[191:53.40]I might be leading them directly towards you.
[191:57.80]Well, I'm about to be escaped completely.
[192:04.88]Just kidding.
[192:10.87]I'm going off-road.
[192:11.59]I feel like being on the road is bad.
[192:13.29]They're not gonna throw up in my mouth.
[192:18.44]You are on the other side of the map for me.
[192:21.82]Other side of the map?
[192:22.64]Yeah.
[192:23.10]I just see your icon, like, so far away.
[192:25.74]I'm just trying to get away from the pursuers.
[192:32.15]You're exiting the bay area.
[192:36.63]Does that mean I escaped the pursuers?
[192:44.84]Can we escape the fucking pursuers?
[192:46.66]No.
[192:48.80]No, Jerma.
[192:49.36]How are they still chasing me?
[192:51.00]They shouldn't be chasing me.
[193:00.57]Can't we just ditch the loud car, man?
[193:02.17]That would be wonderful.
[193:05.13]God.
[193:08.00]Alright, well you guys... What?
[193:18.49]Escape the pursuers!
[193:19.69]Oh, did it work?
[193:21.47]No, escape the pursuers they said.
[193:22.99]Don't worry.
[193:33.64]I'm working on it.
[193:34.36]Working on it.
[193:35.64]I'm working on it.
[193:38.98]I'm escaping.
[193:39.60]Apparently I am escaping.
[193:42.76]okay should not have just shot the gun tell us if they find us in here then us they deserve to kill us I'm in the middle of the water and I'm still escaping just hiding in the water I'm hiding in the water okay they're still engaging you come to the water strategy I like it's a good strat
[194:08.73]I can hear your car from the other side of the city.
[194:10.83]No wonder you haven't escaped.
[194:12.21]Yeah, like the loud car.
[194:13.23]No, it's working.
[194:15.75]Every three minutes, I lose one star.
[194:19.07]Come on in, Etalyx.
[194:21.95]You'll enjoy it.
[194:22.81]This actually is a lot like GTA.
[194:25.79]If you got off of a road and they didn't know how to get to you, then they would eventually go away.
[194:32.33]Do we actually have to sit here until this is done?
[194:37.71]I refuse to believe that.
[194:39.19]What, isn't it just until the yellow meter goes down?
[194:43.29]Yellow meter?
[194:44.71]I've been sitting on two black yield signs.
[194:50.27]Get in the water.
[194:51.21]I'm fine.
[194:52.05]They can't see me here.
[194:52.91]I'm escaping.
[194:55.49]So we have... Would you or would you not say, Etalyx, that we have escaped the... Okay.
[195:00.86]Yeah, you hadn't escaped.
[195:02.98]You had escaped.
[195:03.88]I have not.
[195:04.58]That was what you were saying.
[195:06.99]I feel you.
[195:07.85]Oh, I was still in the process.
[195:08.94]I can level up.
[195:11.60]I have points.
[195:13.26]Did we level up?
[195:15.14]Uh, I did.
[195:17.30]No, I'm at 97,000.
[195:17.98]I need 4,000 more hacker points to be a professional hacker.
[195:25.35]That one's dumb.
[195:26.35]Where's the one where I can get grenades?
[195:30.70]No, which one is it?
[195:31.80]Gadgets or something?
[195:34.78]Tinkering.
[195:36.26]Explosive device, boys and girls.
[195:38.78]We now have it.
[195:42.87]Explosives.
[195:46.59]I'm going.
[195:47.13]I'm all about the explosives now.
[195:49.73]Remember, don't get detected.
[195:51.49]Throw that out the window from now on.
[195:55.15]What else is there?
[195:57.55]Larger area of effect.
[195:58.83]Let's see.
[196:02.16]It's like a nuke.
[196:06.28]Five explosives at once.
[196:08.80]Five explosives?
[196:11.92]That's like the ultimate one.
[196:17.03]Well, that's... I kind of actually... This is the only other one I'd want.
[196:22.71]It's still in the water.
[196:27.84]No more research.
[196:28.54]Okay.
[196:28.64]Okay.
[196:33.94]So, Etalyx.
[196:34.52]I want to show you something.
[196:36.80]Okay.
[196:38.18]You get to swim to me first.
[196:40.61]I will swim to you.
[196:42.47]There's no cars up here, by the way.
[196:46.13]Not one single car.
[196:47.83]So, I think the truck.
[196:48.83]Okay.
[196:51.67]Yep.
[196:52.11]Why did I do that?
[196:52.85]I don't know why I did that.
[196:53.65]What the fuck was the point of doing that?
[196:55.24]Well, there is another car over here, at least.
[196:57.02]Yours.
[196:58.20]Which somehow did not reach the water.
[197:00.24]Hey, let me...
[197:01.51]Let me actively ruin our game.
[197:03.85]Why?
[197:04.11]Did you set the alarm on this before you left?
[197:09.67]Oh, God.
[197:16.17]What?
[197:18.27]Can't kill me.
[197:19.17]You can't kill me.
[197:21.13]Why not?
[197:21.59]Can you detonate it manually?
[197:25.34]No, I can't.
[197:28.52]Uh-huh.
[197:31.98]Yes, you can.
[197:32.56]No, I can't.
[197:33.44]No, I can't.
[197:34.20]I didn't do that.
[197:34.98]I did it.
[197:36.40]How did you do that?
[197:37.64]Because I'm a hacker.
[197:39.66]You hacked my explosive.
[197:40.88]I've got an iPhone.
[197:42.88]Yeah.
[197:43.62]Throw it again.
[197:45.34]This game was ruined well before you came to play it.
[197:48.16]Throw another one.
[197:50.49]It's recharging.
[197:51.19]I can't.
[197:55.31]Well, there goes our cars.
[197:56.77]Time to fast travel.
[197:59.84]How do you do that?
[198:01.65]Open up your map?
[198:02.51]Yeah.
[198:02.83]Where are we going?
[198:03.85]I guess, more specifically.
[198:07.75]Steal the encrypted drives?
[198:08.87]That sounds like another boring, dumb mission.
[198:12.15]Steal the encrypted drives.
[198:13.50]Oh, dear.
[198:15.70]Bounty hunt.
[198:17.80]Okay.
[198:18.22]I think there's three mission types.
[198:20.62]Free the prisoner.
[198:21.58]There seem to be three mission types.
[198:24.61]Yeah.
[198:25.19]Find and destroy the two gun shipments.
[198:28.72]That one really sounds a little bit different.
[198:31.92]We've got three gun shipments.
[198:37.57]They're all in Oakland, in the east.
[198:39.69]Alright, let's do the find destroy the three gun ones.
[198:44.93]Alright, you see the the dinner, the restaurant right below it, fast travel there.
[198:51.25]You hit square on it, you just put your cursor.
[198:52.75]I get to zoom way in first.
[198:56.75]Yeah.
[198:57.21]That's so cheap.
[198:58.64]But, you know, what are you gonna do?
[199:06.22]The bounty stuff isn't co-op?
[199:08.96]Well, that's unfair.
[199:10.06]That's unfair.
[199:10.46]Hi.
[199:26.14]You gonna punch this guy in the head?
[199:27.58]Don't do it.
[199:29.66]Don't do it before we loot his whole place.
[199:32.99]Never mind.
[199:34.03]Oh, wait.
[199:35.35]I know what we can do.
[199:35.89]He saw the gun.
[199:50.23]I think he's still alive.
[199:52.19]Is he still alive?
[199:56.62]Why did that not kill you?
[199:58.12]That's the weird part.
[200:03.20]Um, are we on a mission?
[200:04.22]What target?
[200:04.54]I have no idea what the fuck it's talking about.
[200:06.40]I'm like sipping on a latte.
[200:14.47]Okay.
[200:24.38]Uh, come look at my leg.
[200:28.36]Does that look odd to you?
[200:29.34]It's kinda just hanging out down there.
[200:32.34]Why am I straddling the car like this?
[200:36.06]You gotta be a better hacker.
[200:37.36]You gonna make me do this joke?
[200:38.59]Fine.
[200:40.31]I honestly can't do it.
[200:42.31]You just don't know how to hack.
[200:43.51]You just caused a chain reaction.
[200:47.71]No, see, when I throw it on the ground, right?
[200:50.29]L1!
[200:50.81]You look at it.
[200:51.35]It just makes like, it makes like the giant, L1, look at it, it's a big field.
[200:54.69]Alright, look at it, like, you see, and then hold L1.
[200:59.29]What's wrong with us?
[200:59.81]And then you hit X. Oh, I thought it was just like a thing you threw and could blow it up.
[201:06.25]I didn't know it was like a, oh, it could make, it could make like noise.
[201:08.81]It could be like a distraction.
[201:09.81]Oh, look, it's a little thing.
[201:11.53]It makes a funny noise.
[201:12.47]Yeah, so you can throw it, lure people to it, and then blow them up.
[201:15.97]I dare you to step on it.
[201:17.09]I dare you.
[201:18.35]Go stand up.
[201:18.77]I dare you.
[201:21.02]Well, you won the dare.
[201:22.14]Nice job.
[201:23.68]Did you pick it up?
[201:25.36]Yeah.
[201:25.58]You have, like, a limited number of them or something?
[201:29.08]Uh, two, but they recharge.
[201:30.38]Alright, where's the steel three things?
[201:37.26]I don't know.
[201:37.60]Don't follow me.
[201:38.44]I'm just running in the direction.
[201:40.24]I think it's actually right here.
[201:42.26]It's right above us.
[201:48.11]Why am I running like an idiot?
[201:59.71]Okay.
[202:00.37]Move around.
[202:01.67]Move around.
[202:03.49]Get the car to move.
[202:06.72]I'll meet you there.
[202:07.24]I gave you some extra time in case you were late.
[202:16.86]Are you kidding me?
[202:17.38]I'm here.
[202:20.24]I'm already on the... I am on the objective.
[202:23.16]What are you doing?
[202:25.56]In case you're late.
[202:27.22]I just ran a guy over at a bus stop.
[202:41.46]can you start it from anywhere you don't okay so only one person has to go to the spot I guess okay breach we have optional destroy the targets within 30 seconds seems kind of hard to do that can I just throw a mine over there that's inside the building
[203:08.91]Are all three of them inside the building?
[203:10.29]I think they're all in the same building.
[203:13.13]Alright, so fuck it.
[203:13.91]Let's do this.
[203:14.29]I'm going to put two on the things we need.
[203:19.19]Watch out for... There's a dog.
[203:22.19]Okay.
[203:25.77]What else is here?
[203:28.37]Dog.
[203:28.85]Nice.
[203:32.10]Put him to sleep.
[203:32.80]Yeah, he's just a little sleepy dog.
[203:35.96]Uh... I'm gonna destroy that.
[203:36.76]I'm gonna put one on... So we have to do it in 30 seconds.
[203:38.14]I'm gonna sneeze, but I... I can't help it.
[203:40.02]Oh, bless you.
[203:41.08]I couldn't stop anything.
[203:43.15]So let's throw one on there.
[203:44.35]Uh-oh.
[203:46.07]I'm being detected.
[203:49.05]What did you get detected for?
[203:50.39]Why did you get detected?
[203:52.03]I didn't know they were all on the roof.
[203:54.75]There are, like, 50 people on the roof.
[203:58.47]Man, there really are that many people there.
[204:00.11]I wanted to do this, like, for real.
[204:01.93]I wanna hack stuff.
[204:06.53]Alright, well, I have that still there.
[204:12.43]So one more to destroy, right?
[204:13.83]Where is it?
[204:16.09]Right there, okay.
[204:16.79]So you go to the other one.
[204:18.96]What?
[204:19.32]There's a guy in here.
[204:22.78]So you go... I'm going to throw another one on this.
[204:26.08]So you go find the other one and then tell me and I'm going to blow this one up and then blow that one up.
[204:30.91]Because I can see it through the wall.
[204:33.53]So you give me the A-OK, and this thing is going boom, boom, and then you have to destroy the other one.
[204:39.39]Okay, where's... Almost there.
[204:43.41]That's the one I already... To the left, I already got that one.
[204:46.27]Oh, I figured you got the ones that were right next to you.
[204:48.47]I think I'm locked in this room.
[204:52.78]Where is this person shooting at me, apparently?
[204:57.92]Oh, there's six people outside.
[205:00.14]I'm dead.
[205:01.62]You're dead?
[205:01.96]Not yet.
[205:02.22]Not yet.
[205:02.96]Almost, though.
[205:07.24]This guy's a really bad shot.
[205:08.88]Whoever it is.
[205:09.46]Uh, this is a vehicle, by the way.
[205:15.45]This is... I don't know how I'm supposed to destroy this.
[205:20.33]I don't have explosive grenades I can throw on things.
[205:23.91]Alright, I'm going for it.
[205:24.88]You ready?
[205:25.96]Yeah.
[205:26.72]Make sure I'm far away enough for this shit.
[205:30.30]One.
[205:32.38]There's two.
[205:33.22]One more.
[205:36.62]Yeah, I don't... There's nothing I can really do.
[205:38.97]Come on, where is it?
[205:41.59]I can get it.
[205:43.27]Just go down.
[205:44.11]Go out the window.
[205:48.50]Do it!
[205:49.12]Do it!
[205:49.92]I don't have any more.
[205:50.50]You don't have any more.
[205:51.16]It's not recharged.
[205:52.16]Shoot it.
[205:55.16]Um...
[206:00.47]Are you sure it's this?
[206:01.37]Are you sure it's this?
[206:02.99]No, but it should be that.
[206:06.96]Are we doing this for no reason?
[206:07.86]It doesn't say it's this.
[206:09.62]I think it worked.
[206:10.16]No, it worked.
[206:10.76]That was all we had to do.
[206:12.66]We had optional two seconds left on the optional.
[206:15.66]Okay, don't die.
[206:16.94]So all we have to do is escape.
[206:18.36]So yeah, that was the right thing.
[206:19.57]Yeah.
[206:21.35]I'm going to have a bomb here in a second.
[206:22.67]Stay away from all this stuff.
[206:24.09]Because everyone's going to blow to hell in about two seconds.
[206:26.47]There's like six cars back to back.
[206:29.09]Yeah, and guess what?
[206:29.93]All six of them are going down.
[206:38.25]Remember that dog from earlier?
[206:39.37]You... Alright, there's only two guys in front of us now.
[206:46.47]Uh, it looks like more than two.
[206:49.81]I see a lot of Viscons on my map.
[206:53.90]May have... May have overshot the bomb.
[206:56.46]May have overshot the bomb by just a little bit.
[207:00.47]You're going to kill us both.
[207:01.53]Get in.
[207:02.63]I can't.
[207:03.39]I can't.
[207:03.98]I can't.
[207:05.64]I can't.
[207:07.48]He just likes to look at the door.
[207:08.74]That's all he likes to do.
[207:10.61]Go.
[207:10.95]Go.
[207:11.23]Get us out.
[207:11.85]Get us out.
[207:12.87]Get us out.
[207:13.29]Go.
[207:17.07]I'm still alive.
[207:17.97]Get in.
[207:18.71]Get me in.
[207:19.03]I'm getting in.
[207:20.97]Okay, go.
[207:21.61]Why are you not in the car?
[207:23.31]I don't understand.
[207:24.47]I'm not doing that.
[207:26.81]I'm opening the door, and now I'm in through the fucking roof.
[207:30.00]Go.
[207:30.40]Just go.
[207:30.82]Just drive.
[207:31.28]Just get without me.
[207:32.10]Who cares?
[207:32.44]Fuck me.
[207:33.16]We both have to get out.
[207:35.96]It won't kill me.
[207:37.02]I'm unkillable.
[207:37.90]You understand?
[207:38.44]I cannot die.
[207:40.18]You can't?
[207:40.74]At all?
[207:41.76]No, I can't.
[207:42.60]You've ran me over five times.
[207:43.98]Okay.
[207:44.24]Watch.
[207:44.44]I'll prove it.
[207:46.67]Alright, well, just run then, I guess.
[207:49.41]I don't know.
[207:50.07]I can't die.
[207:51.30]Okay.
[207:53.44]Oh, what's this thing on the wall?
[207:54.48]I wonder.
[207:56.46]Oh, shit, that hurt.
[207:59.12]No, that's it.
[208:00.08]I'm dead.
[208:00.76]You are dead?
[208:01.34]Yeah, yeah.
[208:02.50]Okay, well, I made it out of the area.
[208:08.57]I'm on a roof.
[208:10.35]They'll never find me.
[208:12.37]That was ridiculous looking.
[208:15.56]Okay, I have a loading screen.
[208:20.14]I have a very long loading screen.
[208:23.27]Okay, I can't really think I made it out.
[208:29.09]Cool backflip.
[208:29.72]Shut down by CTOS.
[208:32.02]What the fuck are they talking about?
[208:34.26]What is going on?
[208:35.16]Both players must leave the area.
[208:39.45]We did it.
[208:40.93]Ugh, you're welcome.
[208:41.63]This is fucking crazy.
[208:42.85]27,000.
[208:43.09]Now I can actually, uh, buy an upgrade.
[208:47.83]Alright, give me one second.
[208:50.23]Ding!
[208:52.96]Uh, thank you, Ferret Facade, for the sub.
[208:54.72]Ooh, we got six points.
[208:55.78]Corporal Small, two months.
[208:57.02]Thanks a lot.
[208:57.46]Become the bull in a China shop.
[209:00.47]We kind of have been that the whole time.
[209:02.68]FlubboSaint63122, Fumusks, GreenLightMob, Kronos415, Austin601, thanks for five months.
[209:14.04]And I believe that's it.
[209:14.88]Did I say hi to ReptilianGod and LucySayStab and WalmartCustomerService and SoDirty and Ahon?
[209:20.66]I hope so.
[209:22.51]Little bits.
[209:23.23]Leather Jacket.
[209:23.79]Leather Jacket with 300 bits.
[209:25.11]I'm pissed at this game, and I'm not even playing it.
[209:27.63]Good God.
[209:28.56]The game sucks.
[209:31.86]Here's the thing.
[209:32.38]I think they have been having online issues over the last three or four days.
[209:37.74]They're going to come out on Tuesday.
[209:39.95]They're apparently working on it, but who fucking knows.
[209:45.33]But thanks, Leather Jacket with 300.
[209:46.33]Leather Jacket, who is, I think, potentially a new King mod.
[209:54.55]Although, Ronnie would probably have something to say about that.
[209:58.63]Oh, did I miss anybody else?
[210:01.15]Much love to all you guys.
[210:03.13]Given the bits and the subs.
[210:06.51]You guys are fucking cool.
[210:08.97]Appreciate it.
[210:11.37]And we're back.
[210:16.06]Alright.
[210:18.40]King mod.
[210:19.12]Hmm.
[210:21.18]Hmm.
[210:22.55]Dude, I remember being here in Watch Dogs 1.
[210:25.93]We're going to do a callback to the video.
[210:28.08]You guys remember?
[210:28.62]It was like this guy.
[210:29.32]He was playing on his computer video game.
[210:31.90]And we threw a grenade at him.
[210:35.24]I don't know what to upgrade.
[210:42.86]He wasn't running like this in the video.
[210:45.58]He wasn't running like this.
[210:46.42]He was so far away from that.
[210:47.32]Alright, where are you?
[210:48.66]Causing problems.
[210:49.22]Causing problems.
[210:49.84]I don't think I put my points in a good place.
[210:52.98]Did I level up?
[210:53.90]No.
[210:54.16]I did.
[211:16.54]So can we, these like side operations, can we do these together?
[211:20.42]Um, such as?
[211:23.39]Watch the movie trailer at Hatton.
[211:24.99]No, I don't think we can.
[211:27.29]I think we can only do the purple ones.
[211:34.85]Well, you want to do like another one or two of them?
[211:38.31]It's not going to be funny.
[211:39.09]I feel like we're kind of doing the same thing over and over again.
[211:41.55]What do you think?
[211:42.41]Yeah, hang on.
[211:42.85]I want to show you something.
[211:45.13]Pick a person.
[211:47.57]This lady.
[211:48.11]Okay.
[211:54.29]Alright, don't kill him.
[211:56.58]He's not going to be funny, by the way.
[211:57.80]I'm just warning you.
[211:58.52]I just want to try out my new toy.
[212:00.56]Someone just screamed into the mic.
[212:04.60]What is this guy?
[212:09.00]I shot that guy with a shotgun.
[212:12.27]As fucking close as you could be with a shotgun.
[212:15.29]And it didn't even hurt him.
[212:17.43]I didn't get to see your joke.
[212:19.27]It's not a joke.
[212:24.40]Yeah, okay.
[212:26.46]Why is there a gumdrop with a sad face?
[212:28.38]Never mind.
[212:28.86]Dude, blame the guy that I didn't die when I shot him with a shotgun.
[212:38.55]I know you have Kevlar, but man.
[212:41.69]What is up with this guy?
[212:43.41]That's what I'm talking about.
[212:44.29]It's like the Kevlar vest protects his face.
[212:50.66]Alright, let's go to the next mission.
[212:55.54]Alright, let's do... Download the experimental worms.
[212:59.47]Yeah, we've done that like a hundred times.
[213:01.53]Is there anything else to do in the open world?
[213:06.45]That... See, that I don't know.
[213:09.07]That I don't know.
[213:11.49]How come there are restaurants and coffee shops?
[213:13.41]What's the point?
[213:14.25]Do you hack them for money?
[213:15.09]Do you steal their money?
[213:15.75]I mean, we can like hack the pay phones or something, but like...
[213:21.28]that's now let's just go to one more and then I yeah that's all it how long we how long we're going for like three and a half four hours yeah three and a half by the end of this would probably like for feel like we've done most of the stuff we can do in multiplayer what do you guys think yeah I agree just because you can't if you can do the campaign and be a little it would be more because usually they save like the cool stuff you can do for the campaigns you know
[213:52.11]too bad so which one you want to do um well we have a option between experimental worms feel the drives they I mean they all kind of boil down to the same let's just do this one we have to we get to go across the bridge one more time that'll be fun let's get across the bridge
[214:20.50]Hack the planet, man.
[214:22.32]Ubisoft.
[214:26.82]Sorry, I was drinking.
[214:27.60]That guy just came out at the worst possible time.
[214:32.96]That guy tried to get in.
[214:34.76]I hear the car.
[214:35.68]It's almost here.
[214:37.04]It's almost here.
[214:38.76]Give me the insurance money.
[214:42.25]Can't collect insurance money when you're dead.
[214:47.95]But first...
[214:52.39]See the car dealership?
[214:55.35]Let's go look at the... See what we can do there.
[214:56.71]I don't think we've walked into the car dealership once.
[215:02.42]Hack the hacker.
[215:03.60]Quick, he's right here.
[215:04.54]Wait, what are we doing?
[215:06.08]Hack the hacker.
[215:07.40]Hack this guy.
[215:08.90]Hack him.
[215:09.58]Screw this.
[215:12.68]Hack him.
[215:13.18]Downloading.
[215:26.53]Like, what could he have on his phone that's that valuable?
[215:29.89]Hack him!
[215:30.87]I'll hold him.
[215:31.93]You hack him.
[215:35.37]Quick, hack him!
[215:36.55]I'm already hacking him.
[215:38.67]He's already being hacked.
[215:42.13]Am I hacking him?
[215:43.09]What are these guys doing here?
[215:45.43]These aren't even cops.
[215:47.65]These aren't cops?
[215:48.35]No, they're just, like, the purple gang.
[215:51.33]It's like movie studio executives.
[215:56.69]Oh.
[215:57.31]I exploded.
[215:58.33]I exploded.
[216:02.39]Oh, now I have a legendary Ubisoft loading screen.
[216:08.48]I'm still winning.
[216:09.76]Almost got it.
[216:10.18]Thank you, Sam.
[216:16.88]It's alright, we're still hacking him.
[216:18.98]Because I didn't die.
[216:20.78]Yep.
[216:21.10]It's good.
[216:22.02]Just move around in like a zigzag.
[216:24.11]Nice.
[216:24.43]We got like no followers for that.
[216:25.71]Mission sucked.
[216:26.59]It wasn't a mission.
[216:27.35]It was just like a open world dynamic event.
[216:30.75]We got to take out the helicopter.
[216:31.91]Take out the helicopter.
[216:37.98]It does the same thing as GTA when you shoot a guy up.
[216:40.54]What the...
[216:43.13]When you shoot a guy out, the thing just leaves.
[216:46.46]Come on.
[216:46.92]At least make it a little different.
[216:48.60]Make them try to kill you with the blades.
[216:50.16]That's what I'd put in my game.
[216:53.66]Oh my gosh.
[216:54.92]Every single car is exploding.
[216:58.95]Did you see any of those?
[217:00.57]Yeah.
[217:01.99]That's pretty interesting firework.
[217:03.25]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[217:03.63]At least 7.
[217:03.99]Who's this fat guy?
[217:04.51]Uh-oh.
[217:14.54]There's a dog.
[217:16.10]I'm dead.
[217:16.42]There is a dog.
[217:17.91]How did you die from that?
[217:20.23]Goblin?
[217:21.73]Goblin?
[217:22.27]Why are you looking at me like this?
[217:29.47]What is wrong with this?
[217:31.93]The guy just has no... You're going to give me a heart attack, dude.
[217:37.41]I'm too busy paying attention to one random guy.
[217:40.68]There's like five dogs here.
[217:42.74]Alright, last mission, then we're gonna call it.
[217:44.53]Let's get out.
[217:47.11]Wait, can you ride on this?
[217:48.03]Shit!
[217:48.33]I ran over a dog.
[217:49.37]Can I ride on what?
[217:53.77]Is this a two-seater?
[217:55.13]Are there any two-seaters?
[217:57.12]Uh, we can't do that determination.
[217:58.66]There's currently an SUV following you.
[218:00.62]Oh no, you're gonna blow the street, aren't you?
[218:02.84]No, I'm not.
[218:06.46]I promise you I'm not.
[218:08.96]I'm gonna make him go backwards, though, so he leaves us alone.
[218:11.00]Alright, you look like Zenyatta right now.
[218:15.60]Look at Zenyatta on the screen.
[218:18.62]You guys see it?
[218:19.54]There's Zenyatta.
[218:21.86]He's floating around.
[218:22.62]He's about to do his thing.
[218:23.46]Alright, let me try to jump on.
[218:25.46]James Bond style.
[218:28.08]It didn't work.
[218:34.00]That should have really hurt me, but it did not.
[218:36.72]The answer is no?
[218:37.92]The answer is no.
[218:44.87]I have no idea where we're going.
[218:51.89]Where are we going?
[218:52.71]That's a good question.
[218:54.29]Let me look at my map real quick.
[218:57.09]We're going right here.
[218:59.99]Apparently it didn't track.
[219:01.91]That only works when we are both in the same car.
[219:04.07]There's the one right next to us.
[219:07.45]Is there one right next to us?
[219:08.87]Yeah.
[219:09.63]Yeah.
[219:09.99]Yeah, that one.
[219:10.93]That's the one.
[219:11.29]It's going to be the lane download one, but...
[219:14.66]Yeah, but they're all the lame download ones in their own way.
[219:17.41]Yeah.
[219:18.79]What's with the smoke?
[219:21.09]I can't see anything.
[219:21.61]There's like a permanent fog on me.
[219:27.89]Oh, it's not.
[219:30.03]It's the light.
[219:33.44]I so badly want to get this chopper downed with a sniper rifle or something.
[219:42.48]I'm dead, apparently.
[219:46.15]No, he's starting a mission.
[219:47.15]I get you.
[219:48.99]I am.
[219:50.95]Are you here?
[219:53.19]Why does it say I'm escaping?
[219:54.21]It says I'm loading.
[219:56.25]Because I had, like, a helicopter on me.
[220:01.69]Watch out for the spooky ghost coming out of the computer monitor.
[220:08.05]Hey, let's load the mission.
[220:11.42]Alright, neutralize enemies during download.
[220:14.46]Sure.
[220:22.35]Okay, this is what I was talking about.
[220:23.39]This is what I was talking about.
[220:24.98]He's gonna go off the bridge.
[220:29.38]The mini-map just showed it.
[220:30.64]Here he comes.
[220:32.44]What?
[220:33.18]Where is it?
[220:35.24]Where is it?
[220:37.74]That's a cop.
[220:38.35]This is a cop.
[220:38.77]This is a police officer.
[220:40.43]I don't know what you're talking about.
[220:44.35]I need to look and see who's in here.
[220:48.05]Who the fuck is this?
[220:49.85]It's just some crazy lady.
[220:51.03]Why are they on the mini-map?
[220:54.63]As a police officer.
[220:58.19]Now she's gonna get out of the car.
[220:59.33]She's a machine gun.
[221:02.10]And has a male voice.
[221:03.60]What?
[221:06.66]Where are you going?
[221:07.54]She's like jumping the fence.
[221:09.68]What?
[221:10.02]And dead.
[221:34.96]Wait, let's go to the mission.
[221:37.09]Let's go on to the mission.
[221:39.63]What an outrageous fucking game.
[221:41.19]You wanna know why that happened?
[221:43.60]I don't know.
[221:45.04]It's my new toy.
[221:48.36]oh hold on I enabled this I'm getting like I'm getting flashes I have to slow down so uh I don't know why they had a male voice but I know why grandma had a minigun but why did why was grandma on the map on the map to begin with on the top on the roof she wasn't even near us alright so let me just show you what it does instead of tight come over here god

[222:13.53]Dude, I swear to God that happens.
[222:15.69]When I laugh, like, too hard, too fast, I get this thing where, like, I have to stop because I seriously, it'll go black and I'll have to, like, sit down.
[222:26.40]Guy's just running away.
[222:27.48]Alright, to the left.
[222:28.36]There's a bunch of people in here.
[222:29.66]This guy's running so far away.
[222:30.90]Alright, take a pic.
[222:33.12]But to be fair, though, that was really fucking funny.
[222:37.07]Uh, yeah, guy in the orange vest.
[222:44.61]Alright, now step over this direction.
[222:46.29]Okay.
[222:48.69]And then we wait.

[223:06.08]So, what, you caught, like, a bounty... But why were the bounty people trying to... Where were they even going?
[223:10.23]Who did you put it on?
[223:10.91]I put it on, like, a random person on the side of the road.
[223:14.89]They came up, killed the person, and then drove off, and you caught up to them.
[223:19.01]And that's where Grandma was in the car.
[223:20.91]She was a gang member that I summoned to go kill.
[223:24.09]Dude, did you see what happened to her?
[223:26.41]I was right here on the side of the fence when you did it.
[223:28.08]Oh, my God.
[223:30.10]I inadvertently caused...
[223:32.72]Gangster Grandma to die like that dude.
[223:35.26]That was that was a full-on Yokozuna Crushing her head into the pavement instantly killing alright Let's see how many people are here.

[224:52.58]I don't even know what we're supposed to do.
[224:56.02]We've got the files up here.
[224:57.01]We've got to go upstairs.
[225:00.03]However that may be, I'm not sure.
[225:01.67]Yes, oh, we can climb this.
[225:11.68]Uh, that's the download thing.
[225:14.38]This guy's stuck.
[225:15.04]We need the access key.
[225:16.12]You see this guy running into a wall?
[225:19.50]That guy?
[225:20.96]Yeah, this dude.
[225:21.64]What?
[225:22.54]I don't know what he's doing.
[225:24.14]Oh, he's figured out how to get inside.
[225:29.85]How did you get over there?
[225:30.77]I'm like up here.
[225:32.15]He's got a new door to run into now.
[225:35.19]Can you hack something down there so I can get in the building?
[225:39.31]Hold on.
[225:41.34]Why is it targeting somebody all the way over there?
[225:55.66]What are you even hacking?
[225:58.28]Me?
[225:58.58]I'm shooting people.
[225:59.66]We have killed people.
[226:00.96]Are you downloading?
[226:01.60]I'm supposed to be killing people while you download.
[226:03.00]I'm DPS.
[226:04.72]I can't get through this door.
[226:05.74]Can you open the door for me?
[226:06.56]No, we have to hack this person.
[226:09.64]I'll get it.
[226:10.06]This is like an idiot right here.
[226:12.16]Does he have the key code?
[226:14.14]He does.
[226:14.38]Oh, there's a key down there.
[226:15.26]Don't worry, I'll call into a lane with that guy and get him.
[226:20.73]Alright, I got the key.
[226:30.18]And open this up.
[226:32.80]So, we need to...
[226:36.36]While we download, kill three people.
[226:38.24]Easy.
[226:40.83]There's a guy in here.
[226:41.53]There's a guy already in here.
[226:43.37]How is he even in here?
[226:45.39]One.
[226:45.85]One.
[226:48.53]I hate these doors that they open.
[226:52.13]Two.
[226:52.79]Did you open that door?
[226:53.57]Yeah, three.
[226:55.17]Alright, we got him.
[226:57.49]I'm seeing if they get locked out or if they can open the door themselves.
[227:01.97]I want to know if they can physically open the door or not.
[227:04.35]I wonder if I can shoot him from here.
[227:05.95]No, I'm just going to run away.
[227:10.79]Is he just going to... What a moron.
[227:12.39]He's just going to stay.
[227:13.57]There's a guy right here.
[227:14.93]Where'd this guy come from?
[227:15.87]I'm dead.
[227:18.01]Oh, this guy?
[227:18.49]Yeah.
[227:20.33]How did that even happen?
[227:22.55]We were looking at both of the doors.
[227:25.17]I think that guy wasn't here, but...
[227:27.67]Yeah, that one right there.
[227:30.83]Don't ask me, get closer.
[227:31.53]The Auntie Shoe Boys.
[227:42.77]83%.
[227:42.79]Are you alive again?
[227:45.01]Yeah, 100 meters away from the download location.
[227:48.15]With already in hot pursuit, people already know they want to get me.
[227:54.14]You're going to complete this though, right?
[227:55.44]Yeah.
[227:56.66]Yay.
[227:58.02]Both players must leave the area.
[227:59.78]Easy.
[228:00.16]I really didn't think they would shoot me.
[228:09.34]I was playing with fire.
[228:10.80]Alright, I need a car.
[228:14.09]I see your body's down here.
[228:16.71]He doesn't say you're dead.
[228:17.81]Oh, I'm dead.
[228:18.35]You're just lying here.
[228:20.79]Those two guys would not shoot me until I got close.
[228:24.85]That guy.
[228:29.71]Oh, man.
[228:30.17]I'm gonna... I'm gonna take... That's a nice car.
[228:32.49]I'm taking that thing out of here.
[228:41.33]And... Get out!
[228:53.32]Move it or lose it!
[228:56.97]Well, that was anticlimactic.
[228:58.91]Yeah, I just hacked a fence.
[229:00.19]That's true.
[229:03.93]And escape the pursuers.
[229:06.14]I am not even being chased.
[229:10.18]This one's all you.
[229:16.46]That would kill any human.
[229:20.64]If you are a human being, you die from that.
[229:25.81]I don't care who you are.
[229:27.01]I don't care where you're from.
[229:30.34]As long as you live.
[229:34.38]Oh no.
[229:36.40]I don't care who you are.
[229:40.34]Where you're from.
[229:42.30]What you've done.
[229:44.57]Look at this escaping I'm doing.
[229:47.71]Escaped.
[229:51.75]And what do we get?
[229:58.26]Copyright.
[229:59.02]Copyright.
[230:00.92]Did I get anything for that?
[230:02.90]Was that a little early?
[230:03.76]Okay.
[230:08.55]Something just opened up in the middle of the street.
[230:10.07]I don't know what it was.
[230:15.63]You came in right when I swung at her, so that noise... I jumped out of the car, and the car just kept going.
[230:21.70]Dude, the yo-yo was so brutal sounding.
[230:30.79]Alright.
[230:31.41]I think that's gonna be... That was a nice kick.
[230:33.81]Gotta end every single open world stream by just meleeing as many people as possible.
[230:39.38]Yeah, and you have to wait till this guy... People get here to track this guy and kill him.
[230:43.50]And then we kill him instead.
[230:44.62]And we take out everybody else.
[230:45.76]What?
[230:55.43]He's gonna get away.
[230:57.05]Why are they on the ground?
[230:58.33]They just both fell.
[231:02.73]They're trying to use this as cover, and it's getting pushed.
[231:06.89]It's getting ever so slightly pushed.
[231:08.47]Now he's going to kill the guy in the truck.
[231:09.83]I think they got him.
[231:14.04]Alright.
[231:14.58]Time for them to get out.
[231:15.26]I love being that close to an explosion.
[231:22.62]You just kind of go, wow, and you hold your hand up.
[231:25.31]My face is really hot right now.
[231:32.83]What is that roundhouse yo-yo?
[231:34.45]Sorry, a fucking yo-yo would not do that.
[231:37.11]Yo-yo's a shitty piece of plastic.
[231:38.89]What if it's got razor wire?
[231:41.43]Alright, this is the last ride of the Valkyries.
[231:48.19]This is Bonnie and Clyde.
[231:50.43]The Bonnie and Clyde run.
[231:56.81]How'd you do that so soon?
[231:59.60]Because I'm an expert hacker.
[232:02.61]Alright, Clyde.
[232:03.75]Good luck!
[232:05.71]I can't get out.
[232:06.37]They would not let me get out.
[232:07.44]I'm dead.
[232:10.78]Alright, I'm going to say farewell to my friends in my stream.
[232:14.78]That is a great place to call it quits.
[232:17.16]Goodbye, JermaStream.
[232:19.43]Yeah, thank you for playing with me, Etalyx.
[232:21.21]It was fun.
[232:22.83]Anytime.
[232:22.99]Make sure you guys follow Etalyx.
[232:25.03]twitch.tv/Etalyx.
[232:28.44]He's a psycho, dude.
[232:29.60]You should see him on his regular streams.
[232:31.12]He is a psycho.
[232:32.30]He's awesome.
[232:32.88]It's crazy.
[232:34.17]Very normal, not funny guy stream.
[232:39.73]You say that now, and then you got like... Are you getting chased by cops?
[232:43.60]Yeah.
[232:44.52]You are.
[232:45.28]I'll help you out here.
[232:51.02]No.
[232:51.58]Try again.
[232:52.10]That didn't even hurt you.
[233:03.64]Where did your body go?
[233:06.94]Did you explode?
[233:07.88]No, the cops throw grenades.
[233:10.22]Open world is too much, but I can't stop.
[233:13.06]It's an open world.
[233:15.90]You can do whatever you want.
[233:17.78]Like this lady.
[233:18.40]I'm going to hack this old lady across the street.
[233:27.49]Hold on, I'll hacker.
[233:29.31]That was a perfect hack.
[233:31.13]Alright, I'm muting.
[233:31.81]I'll see what I do.
[233:34.71]Okay.
[233:35.11]Alright.
[233:36.41]Thanks, everybody, for coming out.
[233:38.85]That was fun.
[233:39.37]The game's fun.
[233:41.13]I mean, it's kind of like if you like Grand Theft Auto and you like playing with your friends and fucking around, then maybe you'd consider it.
[233:48.72]I don't know how good the single player is.
[233:54.12]But that was at least about three to four hours of fun.
[233:58.65]Although there's not really much else to do.
[234:00.29]Although, don't they have some shit going on with invasions or something?
[234:04.58]Aren't they going to do Dark Souls type invasions where while you're playing the game some random hacker can just be in your game?
[234:10.48]Because that might be fun if you're just doing the campaign and all of a sudden you have to deal with the hacker that jumps in your game.
[234:16.97]What the fuck?
[234:17.87]Oh, that was... That was my rumble of my controller.
[234:24.75]This looks worse than the first one.
[234:27.64]Yeah, I cannot give it a recommend or don't recommend.
[234:33.23]There are so many police everywhere.
[234:38.89]I could give it a recommend, but I have not played more than 20 minutes of the single player.
[234:45.06]So I don't know.
[234:46.89]If you like what you saw on the stream, then there you go.
[234:49.90]But... There was about 3, 4, 5 plus maybe hours of multiplayer fun with your friends.
[234:55.56]And then if you just want to do the campaign.
[234:57.20]However long that is.
[234:58.54]If you're into that, you're into it.
[234:59.44]If not, then you're going to have to make your own judgments.
[235:02.29]Because I can't tell you because I haven't played single-player.
[235:06.83]Anyways, guys.
[235:07.81]Let me just say special thanks to...
[235:12.05]Arcane hooves.
[235:13.49]Thanks for the sub.
[235:16.29]Bug cat.
[235:17.71]Bug cat chervarm.
[235:19.43]Thanks for two months.
[235:20.71]Ferret facade.
[235:21.39]Corporal small.
[235:22.71]Flubbo.
[235:23.25]Saint 63122.
[235:25.55]I believe I got these guys already.
[235:26.75]Green.
[235:27.11]Yeah, I got these guys already.
[235:28.23]Thank you so much, guys.
[235:32.65]300 million bits.
[235:33.48]Well, thank you, Void Stars.
[235:34.42]Appreciate it, dude.
[235:39.71]If you like GTA V, then you already own GTA V and want to try something else.
[235:43.72]Yeah.
[235:45.02]It's just like a different version.
[235:48.18]Okay, it's a future GTA V. There you go.
[235:54.03]So tomorrow night is going to be sorcery.
[235:55.60]We're going to try to finish it, the finale, hopefully tomorrow night at 7 o'clock.
[235:59.82]So, hope you guys enjoy the stream.
[236:02.72]Again, Etalyx streams too.
[236:05.84]He'd probably appreciate it if you gave him a follow.
[236:08.59]So that's it.
[236:09.05]Good night.
[236:09.77]Take care, everybody.
[236:10.85]I'll see you tomorrow at 7 o'clock for sorcery's finale.
[236:17.17]Thank you, cold fridge.
[236:20.76]And with that, I'm going to say good night.
[236:23.32]Goodbye.
