[00:31.81]How's it going?
[00:32.21]What's happening?
[00:36.57]I'm at the beach right now.
[00:38.07]Oh, that sounds actually kind of fun.
[00:41.20]At the beach?
[00:46.08]I'm at the North Pole.
[00:55.01]What?
[00:57.37]Where are you guys?
[00:58.24]No.
[00:59.68]Good to see you.
[01:02.09]Today we're going to play Halls of Torment.
[01:05.91]it's a Vampire Survivors like had my eye on it for a little while and unfortunately I'm playing this game one day too early because I believe the beta launches in like a day or two so that's my fault I'm playing it literally like 24 hours too early but that's too bad because I want to play it bad
[01:35.03]So even if it is beta comes out in the next day or two, whatever.
[01:39.89]It looks really fun.
[01:41.65]I'm a huge Vampire Survivors fan.
[01:46.54]So I'm going to play it.
[01:49.48]I'm ready.
[01:53.64]I'm here for five minutes to laugh at how lame this is.
[01:55.98]Alright, we'll see you later.
[01:58.10]Thanks for stopping by.
[02:06.19]Bye.
[02:08.77]Okay.
[02:09.05]Anyways, let's go.
[02:11.19]I'm fresh save file.
[02:13.68]Hey, can you wait?
[02:14.46]My boyfriend's in the bathroom.
[02:15.60]Yeah.
[02:15.86]What do you think?
[02:17.46]Like another minute or two?
[02:22.87]Two minutes?
[02:30.33]Yeah, it's a fresh save file.
[02:32.57]I love these games with a fresh save file.
[02:36.19]Because I'm going to be terrible.
[02:38.27]I'm going to have no items.
[02:40.35]I'm going to be dog shit at the game.
[02:42.73]I love it.
[02:44.17]I can't wait.
[02:46.25]What about Hylics 2?
[02:48.55]Yeah.
[02:50.84]Yeah.
[02:55.46]Yeah.
[02:59.11]Your dog shitted all games.
[03:01.97]Um... Clearly, I think you forgot about the... the one to two headshots in a row I got with the Huntsman last week.
[03:08.44]I mean, I... I don't know if you knew that.
[03:13.48]I'm not sure you saw that footage.
[03:14.62]Yeah, we're just gonna chill out.
[03:20.49]Chill stream.
[03:22.21]And I mean it this time.
[03:23.15]I just want to play this game and hang out.
[03:29.02]And I'll go on one or two rants.
[03:30.50]Well, fine, for old time's sake.
[03:31.64]Why not?
[03:35.48]Oh, shit.
[03:35.92]It's a chill stream today.
[03:39.99]You know what I should start doing?
[03:41.79]Anytime I just want to sit, just kind of relax and play and hang out.
[03:44.01]I'm just going to tell you it's going to be the most fucked up stream ever.
[03:47.13]I'm going to tell you, man, it's going to be so exciting.
[03:49.91]There's going to be all kinds of crazy shit's going to happen today.
[03:52.65]So then when it's the complete opposite...
[03:56.38]Then we're good.
[03:57.30]That's how it's going to be, right?
[04:01.03]False advertising?
[04:02.01]That's alright.
[04:09.50]You're still a streamer?
[04:10.62]I mean, yeah, I guess.
[04:13.02]Kinda.
[04:14.12]Yeah!
[04:16.40]What am I doing right now?
[04:20.39]Dude, you're still... I streamed like four or five days ago.
[04:23.89]I haven't been gone for like six months.
[04:30.52]Alright, you guys ready?
[04:34.24]Take a look at this.
[04:39.34]Alright, so like I said, this is like Vampire Survivors.
[04:40.99]I know nothing about the game.
[04:42.11]I've been told this is unbelievably fun.
[04:43.95]I am so ready to play it.
[04:46.87]All I know is that there's this quest thing.
[04:51.67]And this is Chapter 1.
[04:54.56]I cannot wait to play this.
[04:57.32]I've been sitting on this for a long time.
[04:59.46]There are 200 quests.
[05:01.18]The game's not even out yet.
[05:05.54]There's 201 quests.
[05:06.33]The game's not even out yet.
[05:11.89]Alright, so what do I want to do?
[05:12.89]Survive until there are only 26 minutes left.
[05:14.79]So that's easy.
[05:15.67]Well, no.
[05:16.43]I mean, it's just an easy mission.
[05:19.78]Defeat the Imp Chieftain.
[05:22.46]Okay.
[05:28.60]I imagine it's the gigantic... Okay, it's the gigantic door.
[05:31.16]Alright, move, aim, attack, toggle auto attack, and toggle auto aim.
[05:41.12]Ooh, okay.
[05:46.96]Should I hold the button down?
[05:51.51]Alright, level up.
[05:51.97]Alright, so I think you can get items in the game too.
[05:56.84]The gameplay is, it has control support.
[05:59.16]I'll do just keyboard and mouse for now.
[06:02.20]I'm into it though.
[06:05.31]He's going to be playing on food mode.
[06:06.91]Did you know what actually is food mode?
[06:10.81]Diablo II summoning classes.
[06:13.97]That's like the best food mode.
[06:15.94]I thought about this a lot.
[06:18.16]Summoning Necromancer and summoning Druid is the ultimate food mode.
[06:22.70]You can play with one hand.
[06:25.38]Alright, hold on.
[06:28.19]Plus 8% area cone size.
[06:29.87]That's pretty cool.
[06:33.02]Tablism 1.
[06:34.12]Health regen, crit damage, and movement speed.
[06:37.72]Hey, chat, which one?
[06:38.88]Hey, chat, which one should I do?
[06:41.58]Chat's complaining about the graphics?
[06:43.72]They don't know what the... Absolute... I almost just said fuck.
[06:47.79]Right?
[06:47.93]They don't know what the heck they're talking about.
[06:49.15]Uh, I'm gonna say movement speed.
[06:53.69]Alright, there's something down here.
[07:01.41]Oh, monster crits.
[07:06.43]It's not about graphics.
[07:09.91]It's about gameplay.
[07:17.75]I have to pick up the things, but wait.
[07:20.08]Actually, I am moving kind of slow, aren't I?
[07:22.48]You need to get the little guys.
[07:23.58]I think I'm doing okay.
[07:29.78]Alright, defense, range, attack speed.
[07:31.89]I'm going to go with cone size.
[07:35.25]Is that stupid?
[07:36.03]We'll find out.
[07:41.36]I love these games.
[07:43.56]Vampire Survivors was my game of the year last year.
[07:48.58]So these are like, I love these.
[07:51.76]I'm so glad this is getting the treatment where a ton of people just make these.
[08:02.34]I will say, though, a lot of them, I haven't really thought were that great.
[08:07.24]I thought they were okay.
[08:09.40]But, I mean, when you're talking about the Vampire Survivors, this is the king.
[08:15.67]But I've heard this one is quite good.
[08:19.61]Oh, probably this one.
[08:22.13]Crit damage.
[08:25.35]I can't wait just to start absolutely mowing down monsters.
[08:31.85]Really going to get that feeling of just absolutely mowing down monsters.
[08:47.08]What's the plot?
[08:48.40]I don't know.
[08:48.80]I just like to click on the skeletons.
[08:51.00]That's all I care about.
[08:51.76]I should probably go pick up the items though.
[09:01.75]Make up some lore right now.
[09:03.09]Okay.
[09:06.89]You guys ever think that skeleton is like a really strange thing?
[09:11.02]That we just like, oh yeah, a skeleton.
[09:14.20]This is somebody's bones.
[09:16.68]Isn't like the concept of a skeleton kind of like weird in a way?
[09:19.81]That's like somebody's bones.
[09:21.03]That's their entire skeleton.
[09:24.95]It's weird we all just look like that.
[09:31.16]Pickup range?
[09:31.72]No.
[09:31.94]Probably this one.
[09:36.12]10% range?
[09:36.42]10% cone?
[09:39.43]I'm way too high for that?
[09:40.29]Uh, it's alright.
[09:43.45]Don't worry.
[09:44.11]We're not gonna stay on it for that long.
[09:51.73]I don't think about that shit, dude.
[09:53.06]I think about taxes.
[09:59.01]Man, you know what I was really thinking about the other day?
[10:01.27]Man, man, like, we all have a skeleton inside of us.
[10:05.97]Like, yeah, dude, you know, there's way more pressing shit to worry about than, like, the fact that we all have skeletons in our bodies.
[10:12.39]Yeah, man, really think about it, man.
[10:13.45]There's, like, you got, like, bones in you.
[10:21.28]New enemy type.
[10:23.88]That's a huge crit, by the way.
[10:25.20]It was, like, two or three times.
[10:35.35]Jeremy, did you see that aliens are real?
[10:39.08]Yeah, I... Take me with you.
[10:41.70]Take me with you.
[10:43.72]Okay.
[10:44.54]I'm just taking this straight away.
[10:45.56]Damage or attack speed?
[10:46.68]Can I get some math Andes in here to help?
[10:50.77]Is 10% more damage better than more DPS?
[10:55.47]I'm curious.
[10:57.93]Attack speed means you will always be doing more damage because you were swinging more often.
[11:04.11]I'm not so sure.
[11:05.67]Ow.
[11:07.95]Tack speed is what I would go for.
[11:09.65]Tack speed for sure.
[11:10.39]Damage, damage, damage.
[11:12.39]I think I'll go with speed.
[11:15.90]Speed sounds good.
[11:16.48]How have you guys been?
[11:18.06]How's it going?
[11:19.58]What's new?
[11:21.26]I'm going to die.
[11:23.88]Oh, I just realized I have 500 health.
[11:40.76]You should talk about aliens.
[11:43.52]Yeah, I don't know.
[11:46.44]Guys, if aliens are real, like, nothing we say is really, like, they might be pissed off that we, like, eat each other.
[11:54.11]You know what I mean?
[11:54.53]Well, not each other, but, like, think about, like, what if an alien species was like, wait a minute, you guys, like, you guys, like, kill and eat stuff?
[12:03.50]What do you mean?
[12:05.10]You eat things?
[12:06.46]You don't just take in, like, energy from the air?
[12:10.08]I don't know.
[12:10.34]They might be, like, annoyed that we, like, eat stuff.
[12:16.01]Who knows what the fuck is gonna happen?
[12:20.17]I want the range.
[12:23.67]Actually deranged?
[12:26.67]I'm just... We don't even know what it even could be.
[12:28.97]We don't even know if it's, like, a carbon-based life form.
[12:30.83]Nobody knows what anything was going on.
[12:40.03]What would the alien national anthem be?
[12:46.52]Ladies and gentlemen, we have landed on Earth, and we are going to play you our national anthem, first of all, to make sure you understand what we are all about.
[12:57.46]And it's just... Just a MIDI version of our national anthem.
[13:06.65]And then we play them the orchestral version.
[13:09.92]And they give us all their technology.
[13:15.36]Uh, area.
[13:21.60]Ooh, I did it.
[13:23.32]This is exactly what you did last time.
[13:28.81]Yeah, well, if you go to like a comedy show, they're going to tell like the same jokes all year.
[13:34.50]understand like if you go to like a stand-up show they have like a bunch of material that they wrote for like a year or two and then they come up with more material like two years later you need to be better than that I'm just hanging out mowing down monsters man
[14:02.95]No, not really.
[14:04.71]Not really.
[14:05.09]Alright, starting to get a little harder.
[14:13.82]Uh.
[14:18.04]I think this.
[14:23.98]Can't go wrong with crit chance now.
[14:32.64]How much is in the non-beta?
[14:38.04]It looked like there was a pretty good amount of content in this game.
[14:43.17]Are they unique?
[14:43.71]That's like the only thing I care about in every video game.
[14:48.49]There's like 20 hours worth of content?
[14:50.08]Oh my god, okay.
[14:53.98]This boss is almost dead.
[14:54.88]Ooh, a Skwo.
[14:59.51]all of your jokes are bad um I don't think all of them are I think like maybe if I were to actually tell you what I really think I think that probably probably like 20 of the jokes that I tell are bad maybe like 30 maybe maybe a little more no no no no wait what is this
[15:26.62]30%.
[15:26.64]Hey, that means I'm batting 700.
[15:29.94]Even if I'm, okay, even if it's 50%, that means I'm batting 500.
[15:37.33]Do you know that you can hit, you can strike out seven out of 10 times and be one of the best baseball players ever?
[15:45.91]You can literally go up there and swing and miss seven times in a row and then hit three home runs and you're one of the best players ever.
[15:56.46]So let's translate that completely to my life.
[16:00.41]A complete false equivalence.
[16:01.89]That it means absolutely nothing next to each other.
[16:04.19]But I'm going to use these two points to tell you why I think that I'm doing just fine.
[16:08.24]Alright, what do I want?
[16:13.24]astronomer's orb metal orbs that circle around the player and damage enemies orbs are indestructible and permanent alright so this is build movement speed short range projectiles in a vertical spread pattern projectiles remain for a short while that's okay lighting's my favorite type of damage but this one seems to be interesting how do I use it oh it just happens
[16:48.18]I always love a good roguelike.
[16:50.62]What is that?
[16:51.48]Uh, well, I'm doing the movement speed because this thing, this guy's fast.
[16:58.40]Jesus.
[17:06.57]Ow.
[17:07.43]Is there a block?
[17:08.49]Alright, I have to, I have to win.
[17:14.23]This is literally, this is the tutorial boss.
[17:16.35]I can't lose to this.
[17:25.60]Whoa!
[17:27.34]Oh my goodness.
[17:28.34]Okay.
[17:29.84]Um... Get rid of the adds.
[17:38.43]I need to level up.
[17:39.41]Give me that scroll down there.
[17:40.95]What's up here?
[17:41.37]Give me the potion, potion, potion, potion.
[17:45.69]That's what that is for sure.
[17:51.13]Is this a damage buff?
[18:08.53]There it is.
[18:08.83]Alright.
[18:09.85]Movement speed or just straight up damage?
[18:11.93]Probably just damage right now.
[18:22.94]Trying to get him hit by the... Oh, I'm fine.
[18:32.89]Oh, I got him.
[18:34.09]I got him.
[18:34.35]I got him.
[18:34.57]I got him.
[18:34.77]Alright.
[18:34.97]Alright.
[18:37.80]Things are getting a lot harder to kill.
[18:39.14]What's in the chest?
[18:46.92]I need more attack speed, 100%.
[18:52.90]Give me that shit.
[18:56.94]Give it to me.
[18:59.00]I'm just like swirling a drain right now.
[19:03.44]Oh, there's items.
[19:04.64]Okay, this just got way fucking cooler.
[19:06.58]This just got way cooler.
[19:10.12]20% attack speed.
[19:11.08]10% crit chance.
[19:13.90]10% health.
[19:14.28]I mean, it's definitely this.
[19:17.28]Cool.
[19:27.84]Ooh.
[19:29.32]I feel the speed, Batchest.
[19:31.44]You can Batchest all you want.
[19:34.06]You are totally in your right to Batchest whenever you want to Batchest.
[19:39.93]But I'm going to disagree with your bat-chesting.
[19:43.61]Idiot.
[19:46.99]Sorry, I put that last part in there.
[19:49.35]Whatever the hell.
[19:55.20]Hmm.
[20:00.00]Yeah.
[20:03.93]Let's get the orbs up.
[20:11.21]I'm going to go up the scroll.
[20:13.41]I did two quests already.
[20:17.19]What the hell is bad chest?
[20:21.18]It means... I don't... I think this thing is cringe.
[20:26.10]And it's like lame.
[20:27.34]So I'm going to... That's what it's supposed to mean, right?
[20:29.74]It's supposed to be like, oh my god, I'm so excited for this thing.
[20:37.65]And like it's cringy how excited I am, right?
[20:39.71]Is that how it is?
[20:48.30]I'm just going to run down here.
[20:54.41]Oh, my God.
[20:55.01]Jerma.
[20:56.07]Oh, my God.
[20:56.51]Jerma.
[20:57.29]Bad chest.
[21:01.99]Come on.
[21:08.20]This is getting crazy right now.
[21:09.86]I'm going to try to wrap around.
[21:22.25]Dude, is this the Jerma stream?
[21:24.39]I'm taking the health because I will die if I don't click this.
[21:30.72]I like the sound effects.
[21:46.45]At the very beginning of the intro, right when the thing loads up and you press start to play, it should go, Welcome to the Halls of Torment!
[22:00.36]They can just use that if they want.
[22:02.72]No, they can't.
[22:03.14]Never mind.
[22:05.51]What am I talking about?
[22:07.01]Ooh, health and movement speed.
[22:12.45]That helps.
[22:19.52]I miss when games used to just yell their title card.
[22:25.10]That was cool.
[22:26.55]Why did we get away from that?
[22:31.31]We replaced having an interesting voice acting at the beginning that just yells the title of your game to like, I don't know, like climb up the tower and activate the radio as like every game now.
[22:48.67]Bring back the fucking yelling the intro.
[22:55.61]Speed.
[22:56.55]Yeah.
[23:12.16]Dance Dance Revolution doesn't do it.
[23:20.40]Dragon Ball Z does that too.
[23:21.60]Oh, there's a lot of shit on the ground.
[23:24.48]Hold on.
[23:32.89]It's, I mean, these are all good.
[23:34.99]But which one is the most good?
[23:38.69]Does Mario Kart still do it?
[23:39.89]Yeah, does he still go Mario Kart?
[23:45.46]In Mario Kart, they even go a step forward.
[23:47.46]Like another step beyond that.
[23:49.29]It's select your player.
[23:51.75]Choose your character.
[23:53.57]Street Fighter does it, right?
[23:55.55]Street Fighter 6.
[23:57.30]Yeah.
[23:57.82]And of course, you understand why Capcom is just absolutely killing it lately.
[24:01.66]They just, they say all the names of their games in their intros.
[24:19.93]I know a lot of you didn't think I was going to get this far on my first run, but you have no idea how much I loved Vampire Survivor.
[24:25.33]It's like my favorite video game.
[24:31.39]I'm going to say, well, let's go with the 70 health.
[24:39.50]Do you get to keep the items?
[24:41.26]Ah, this is the end here for sure.
[24:42.84]Yeah.
[24:43.14]Yep.
[24:43.36]Okay.
[24:47.10]Alright.
[24:49.78]Character level 18, survival 12 minutes.
[24:55.38]You suck.
[24:57.44]You're supposed to die.
[25:00.04]They don't understand these games.
[25:02.28]Alright, what did I get?
[25:03.74]I unlocked the archer.
[25:06.41]I unlocked under the stage.
[25:08.91]I got a new ability, ring blades, and then I got a shrine of blessings.
[25:13.97]The next quest is to enter ember grounds and rescue the wellkeeper.
[25:19.23]Cool.
[25:19.57]I got a thousand bucks.

[26:20.18]Alright, so... Kill 5,000 enemies in one run.
[26:23.28]Sounds easy.
[26:23.60]Can you please comment on Quiznos?
[26:27.95]I like Quiznos.
[26:28.73]I haven't had it in a long time, but I love it.
[26:34.57]I'll do... Yeah, let's go for it.
[26:35.83]Let's just do it again.
[26:38.85]Can I have a turn now?
[26:40.57]Uh, no.
[26:41.35]It's my Xbox.
[26:45.18]Alright, this character seems very, very good.
[26:56.89]I'm telling Mom.
[27:00.61]You got a PlayStation.
[27:02.09]I have the Xbox.
[27:04.70]Go play Demon's Souls or whatever is on that fucking console.
[27:09.84]I'm on the Xbox.
[27:14.58]That's just more speed.
[27:19.58]Is this game even on Xbox?
[27:20.89]No, it's not.
[27:22.45]I'm on PC.
[27:32.63]Is it on Game Pass?
[27:35.56]I have all three.
[27:36.84]Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[27:39.55]Hey, come on.
[27:43.17]I'm going to go just all damage on this one.
[27:51.25]You can probably increase the projectiles.
[27:55.85]I hope so.
[27:56.23]I'm going to go pick that parchment up, whatever that is.
[28:08.89]How do people play this with a mouse?
[28:11.71]If I was going to play with controller, I would do auto-aim.
[28:13.73]These are all kind of weak.
[28:20.77]Block strength?
[28:21.57]What if you don't have a shield?
[28:28.25]I'll go defense.
[28:32.53]Uh, aiming with the mouse is going to always be a thousand times easier than aiming with an analog.
[28:39.32]So.
[28:43.04]I will probably play with the mouse forever.
[28:47.54]Alright, let me go down this way.
[28:48.52]I thought this was in VR.
[28:52.18]Yeah, I'm the character down there.
[28:55.44]I just don't have the webcam on today.
[28:59.86]Ooh, that's really good.
[29:12.15]Yeah, I'm just I rented out a warehouse that I have like 50 or 60,000 square feet here, so.
[29:19.43]It's really roomy here.
[29:20.29]That's why I can move around this much.
[29:35.80]Is this a?
[29:39.42]I can't decide if I like this joke.
[29:44.38]We have an undecided joke voter here.
[29:47.48]What do we do?
[29:48.26]What do we do to convince them?
[29:49.30]Is there a map?
[30:06.03]You're doing your make shit up voice.
[30:08.71]It's so funny.
[30:09.21]We talked about this before.
[30:11.19]But...
[30:12.52]This is just the way I normally talk.
[30:18.55]Dude, why is he doing the bit voice?
[30:20.65]Oh, it's just like the way the dude actually just like kind of talks normally.
[30:25.27]It's like a real voice.
[30:35.66]Everything is a bit.
[30:39.07]I don't know if I'd say that.
[30:42.29]I just like having fun.
[30:55.16]Laughing my ass off the other day.
[30:56.48]Do you remember when that guy did that zoom call thing where he got like beat up in an octagon?
[31:00.96]Oh.
[31:06.60]Yeah, you know when you you OK.
[31:09.56]You know when you see somebody do something and you wish you made that joke?
[31:15.17]Uh, let's do attack speed You guys have never seen that video of the guys that like in a zoom call and he's like a green screen behind him like Attached to a backpack on him and he's in like an octagon.
[31:30.84]He's getting like beat up in his zoom meeting You've never seen this It's it's fucking insane
[31:43.39]Show it I don't even know how to look for it.
[31:45.01]I just I just remember seeing it Bro picked eight over twenty percent.
[31:51.75]Oh shit.
[31:52.45]Hold on.
[31:54.67]Oh, this is really good I do want to get down to the parchment though
[32:16.14]That was during COVID.
[32:22.38]It's so funny.
[32:27.42]What is this?
[32:33.45]It was a thing to get.
[32:34.25]A quest for this.
[32:39.53]Buyers needles at random nearby enemies in quick succession.
[32:42.68]Multi-hit increases the attack speed.
[32:45.44]I'll do it.
[32:46.92]I'm going to need it right now.
[32:47.75]Okay, multi-hit.
[32:50.11]Let's go 10% damage.
[33:10.16]movement speed no I need more yeah let's keep going attack speed one more level up and I'm going down to get the uh ability for a chance you just made me buy this game I mean the game is fun
[33:38.70]I mean, did you open the stream and see this thing that may have been speaking to you and your gameplay preferences?
[33:45.88]That's what just happened.
[34:00.35]Alright, I'm being stupid.
[34:02.29]But I want the experience.
[34:03.37]I'm doing it for a reason.
[34:10.40]Alright, these are all good.
[34:11.14]I don't know what to do.
[34:17.20]You're a really good salesman?
[34:20.53]Um... I don't... I do not think so.
[34:30.23]Uh... 20% crit damage seems amazing, but so does attack speed.
[34:37.95]That's just...
[34:40.41]This game sounds like I'm sorting through a Lego bin.
[34:45.57]It kind of does.
[34:52.04]It's like, where is that fucking little square with the two pegs on it?
[35:00.48]And it needs to be green.
[35:01.54]This is why I keep saying I need to organize these fucking things.
[35:06.85]Can I just throw them in here?
[35:11.60]How am I ever going to be able to finish the Millennium Falcon now?
[35:16.99]More health.
[35:27.07]Pick up range.
[35:27.97]I know it's lame, but I need it.
[35:43.36]Uh, give me the crits.
[35:46.46]Yep.
[35:50.41]Hey, it's day 34.
[35:51.87]Can you wear a nun cosplay?
[35:54.91]Uh, this is day 34 of me telling you once on day 34 the answer is no.
[36:00.08]So the next 6,000 days of you asking this are going to be a waste of your time.
[36:12.66]There's so much over here.
[36:13.44]I don't want to miss it.
[36:21.54]There's so many little crunchies over here.
[36:29.75]Guard in the middle.
[36:31.05]There we go.
[36:33.01]Alright.
[36:33.37]5% crit, 20% crit damage.
[36:34.17]That's amazing.
[36:58.58]This first boss seems really fun and challenging, but fair enough.
[37:03.35]I like the first boss.
[37:10.67]What's this?
[37:11.01]Is this me reading?
[37:12.98]Alright.
[37:13.22]Do I get this or something?
[37:14.08]Do I have to do anything with that or is it just lore?
[37:49.70]Somebody said, not looking great, bro.
[37:51.43]What do you mean?
[37:52.23]Me playing?
[37:52.79]I'm doing fine.
[37:54.31]I haven't gotten hit for three minutes and you're telling me it's not looking good for me?
[37:57.87]It's been three minutes and I've taken a point of damage.
[38:00.21]I just got an achievement for it.
[38:07.01]Yes!
[38:07.57]Alright, give me that loot.
[38:12.55]Crit chance.
[38:14.47]80% pickup range.
[38:16.85]It's definitely this one.
[38:21.62]I mean, 10% crit.
[38:22.85]That's... Nothing can compare to that.
[38:26.37]Give me the speed.
[38:30.63]There we go, yeah.
[38:33.68]One attack per second.
[38:35.38]One, two, three, four.
[38:37.14]There's even more than one per second.
[38:38.18]Alright, I'm getting too cocky.
[38:41.04]Don't be stupid.
[38:46.79]Go collect.
[38:51.31]Alright, now go down.
[38:53.05]Wait, there's like, brinkets here.
[39:07.09]Come on, level up.
[39:13.63]What am I lacking in right now?
[39:15.17]More attack speed.
[39:43.83]It actually is kind of getting ugly.
[39:44.97]You're right.
[39:48.29]I'm going to turn on auto attack while I collect.
[39:50.67]That's definitely the time to do it.
[39:54.10]Oh, wait a minute.
[39:54.70]It's auto attack, not auto aim.
[39:57.90]I'm really glad I figured that out.
[39:59.32]So I don't have to hold down left click.
[40:02.08]Oh, that's a huge deal.
[40:03.38]That is a monumental deal.
[40:10.68]There's so much stuff over here, but...
[40:13.15]whatever just go for it give me give me everything is it health or is it just more crit it's over believers it might not be I don't know if it's over yet I'm gonna take the health I know it's a lame upgrade but it's effectively drinking a health potion and it's gone already I would have been dead
[40:57.42]I need damage.
[40:58.04]I need piercing and I need damage.
[41:01.22]Right now.
[41:14.19]I mean, that's good enough.
[41:20.12]Damage is damage.
[41:29.80]Alright, now I'm finally going to leave.
[41:39.21]More damage.
[41:39.85]Alright, now I'm running.
[41:42.97]They're starting to need multiple hits with my main weapon to die.
[41:57.96]Oh, shit.
[41:58.52]Okay, hold on.
[42:07.52]He never picks up the regen lamp.
[42:09.98]What's a regen lamp?
[42:14.17]Is that a cool game feature that I haven't been interacting with?
[42:18.09]Don't tell him that.
[42:18.91]What do you mean don't tell me that?
[42:22.39]He doesn't know about the regen lamp.
[42:25.61]Oh, I thought that was a lamp.
[42:37.98]That's a lot of money.
[42:40.18]I'm missing out on a lot of experience, but I don't care.
[42:41.82]I'm getting the other ability.
[42:46.45]Who knows how far away this is, but whatever.
[42:47.81]Increase your movement speed to 8 milliseconds a second?
[43:01.28]I'm going to hang on here for just a second.
[43:07.98]More damage.
[43:13.74]These guys drop a lot of experience.
[43:18.00]This dude has an NA education.
[43:19.94]Why?
[43:20.02]Because I'm just doing damage only?
[43:21.60]What do you mean?
[43:22.24]This is where I lost last time.
[43:33.36]Already made more progress.
[43:42.25]Oh, Gibby, come on.
[43:43.41]Come on.
[43:45.10]Yeah.
[43:48.56]I'm doing moving speed.
[43:53.04]These things are fast.
[44:07.25]I'm going to wrap around.
[44:07.83]This is a lot of experience here.
[44:08.93]I don't even care if I die.
[44:26.00]When are you going to do the auto treat review stream?
[44:29.74]I don't know.
[44:30.24]I don't want to give auto too many treats.
[44:31.50]These are all kind of bad, but I think I'll take this one.
[44:53.45]What's this?
[44:53.89]Ooh.
[45:03.50]He wants all the treats to himself.
[45:09.78]You ever look at the back of a thing of dog treats or a thing of dog food and you go, I could survive on this in the apocalypse.
[45:15.69]I'll be fine.
[45:18.59]You ever look at the ingredients list and you're like, damn, okay, these like, these like really good treats for dogs.
[45:24.42]I could probably eat these in the apocalypse.
[45:38.73]Alright, I'm gonna run.
[45:42.11]Why did you not get damage?
[45:42.95]Because I want to be running very fast.
[45:44.93]Because these things are fast and it's kind of freaking me out.
[45:52.14]Remember, avoiding damage means you can live longer to deal more damage.
[45:57.56]Defense is directly translated to offense in a lot of these games that are in this genre.
[46:07.93]If you stay alive for 10 minutes, you'll do more damage than if you stayed alive for 8.
[46:21.49]Thus increasing your score.
[46:22.75]Alright, this big skeleton has to go.
[46:38.86]Wow.
[46:39.30]Alright.
[46:40.16]30% more.
[46:40.40]5% crit.
[46:41.16]Yep.
[46:42.98]What the fuck are you guys doing?
[46:49.39]The longer the enemy lives, the more damage it does to you.
[46:52.39]But if you don't get hit, then get good, as they say.
[47:08.58]Alright, there goes the... Oh, that was just his shield.
[47:10.74]His shield is the only thing I killed.
[47:12.46]Oh, that's not funny.
[47:15.88]Uh, this might be the end.
[47:24.26]At some point, I'm going to be at like... I'm pretty much at like 50% crit or something, aren't I?
[47:30.58]Something kind of crazy.
[47:41.99]He needs a better gaming chair.
[47:44.10]No, I, I actually really don't.
[47:48.14]I'm doing just fine.
[47:49.24]What do you mean?
[47:50.14]I'm doing fine.
[48:00.89]I got to get rid of this thing.
[48:02.33]Come on.
[48:03.03]Alright.
[48:03.25]There it is.
[48:14.70]Uh, move in speed and help.
[48:16.00]What about, yeah, no.
[48:19.76]Move in speed and help.
[48:25.07]Alright, that second boss has to die.
[48:26.45]Give me the other ability.
[48:29.03]Ring blades.
[48:30.33]Throws blades left and right in alternation.
[48:33.82]Blades act like boomerangs, passing the character and then flying off screen.
[48:37.28]Multi-hit increases the frequency of throwing blades.
[48:42.71]Lightning Strike is random.
[48:43.75]I imagine it's just like in Vampire Survivors.
[48:48.31]Stuns enemies for a brief period.
[48:49.53]Stun enemies can't move.
[48:51.14]Right?
[48:51.92]Electricity.
[48:53.26]Electrify deals damage 100 each tick based on the amount of stacks.
[48:57.98]Ooh, that was a big, that was a bad one.
[49:00.50]Each stack decreases the tick time.
[49:02.74]When Electrify ticks, it is reduced by one stack.
[49:05.96]I didn't read that.
[49:06.58]I didn't comprehend any of that.
[49:07.74]I'm going to go with Ringblades.
[49:09.66]No, Lightning.
[49:21.10]So drunk.
[49:23.06]Yeah, that was like a... Hey, I just... Can somebody read this for me?
[49:32.87]Like the drunk Looney Tunes character.
[49:42.27]I'm getting close to dying.
[49:47.13]And I would have died right there if... What is this?
[49:51.86]It comes with a negative?
[49:59.08]I mean, we're still going with this.
[50:01.68]It's 30% more damage?
[50:02.78]Are you kidding me?
[50:03.32]Alright, I can stay alive.
[50:05.32]I'm going to be quiet.
[50:06.22]I actually don't want to die.
[50:18.64]Shit!
[50:19.14]I thought... Alright.
[50:27.92]I unlocked a new wind crown?
[50:31.50]Piercing wind?
[50:35.69]Did I get 500 bucks?
[50:39.89]Cool.
[50:41.63]Alright.
[50:42.91]I... What do I... Let's try a sword again.
[50:50.43]I killed 3,600 enemies in one run.
[50:52.75]Not quite there.
[51:01.55]Now it's just... I'm going to do the other stage.
[51:07.06]I think that unlocks more stuff.
[51:11.28]Yeah.
[51:13.10]Rescue the Wellkeeper.
[51:14.08]Alright.
[51:20.46]Go for it.
[51:25.07]Auto-aim is toggleable too.
[51:26.45]That's really cool.
[51:27.07]Alright.
[51:27.35]Let's go for it.
[51:35.94]Ooh, this is harder.
[51:36.68]They have a lot more health.
[51:41.08]I just break them out?
[51:46.60]I love this avatar.
[51:47.36]See what I can do.
[51:48.00]You can't die, right?
[51:49.38]He must be nearby.
[51:50.74]I have to level up a few times.
[52:14.70]Everybody does not believe right now.
[52:17.20]Um, I mean, this is a new level.
[52:21.48]This is harder than the first one.
[52:23.94]And this is a roguelike with permanent upgrades.
[52:27.48]I'm going to say, I don't know if I would be betting on the yes right now.
[52:32.25]Maybe a few runs, but who knows?
[52:33.53]What if I do really good and you make a fucking huge amount of channel points?
[52:41.63]I'm going to go tank.
[52:44.05]Oh, key.
[52:55.66]They're manageable.
[53:00.52]Oh, I didn't upgrade last time.
[53:02.61]It's alright.
[53:13.40]Try to hit as many as possible.
[53:28.35]Ouch.
[53:31.78]Damage, yeah.
[53:35.04]You don't have any precision, dude?
[53:37.11]Um...
[53:40.55]I don't, you don't need precision in a game like this.
[53:42.25]It's about surviving waves and mowing down.
[53:46.15]I don't know why I keep saying that.
[53:48.49]It's because, it's because that's like the thing that, I don't know, it's like the Diablo thing.
[53:52.75]Like mowing down waves of enemies, mowing down monsters.
[53:56.57]And I sit here and ask myself, when did I, have I ever cared about that in Diablo?
[53:59.69]Like I've never have, ever.
[54:02.17]Um, okay.
[54:02.65]Attack speed.
[54:15.58]Remember, these are people.
[54:20.82]Well, they're... Well, we're in hell.
[54:23.88]So, okay.
[54:24.92]What do you want to say?
[54:25.58]Uh, coincide.
[54:28.41]Yep.
[54:35.43]It's devil spawn.
[54:36.45]These are not people.
[54:37.38]These are devil spawn.
[54:38.56]What are you talking about?
[54:46.30]No, this is the completely nondescript bad guy character.
[54:50.88]So you never have to feel anything about, like, oh, what am I killing here?
[54:54.66]Because they're like, yes, murder and torture and killing.
[55:00.04]Like, you can't feel bad about killing, like, demon imps.
[55:05.16]We've specifically been told this for, like, the last 100 years of any, like, media and video games and anything.
[55:10.59]It's just, all these things are just evil creatures that hurt stuff.
[55:16.17]And we're also led to believe that they can just be kind of created, just like snap.
[55:19.08]Whoa, there's like another 2000 of them.
[55:25.60]I didn't even read that last part.
[55:33.25]Hey dude, can you find Ben Franklin?
[55:36.33]Ban that person for an hour.
[55:46.16]I have not hurt this guy yet.
[55:50.29]More cone.
[56:01.80]Did you actually ban him?
[56:15.83]your thoughts on PoE.
[56:18.29]I mean, I'm excited to play it.
[56:23.73]Okay, so PoE, let me go over this.
[56:27.60]So I've played a little bit of Lost Ark.
[56:29.30]I've played a little bit of PoE.
[56:30.66]I've played obviously a lot of Diablo.
[56:33.52]My concern with something like PoE, and this is what I've talked to Ster about this a few times.
[56:39.64]My concern was always, it's not that it's overwhelming.
[56:43.65]It's that there is just such an unbelievable amount of content that I'm going to accidentally open up one of the menus for said content and get freaked out.
[56:53.84]It's kind of like when you open up one of these MMO-type games or these, like, kind of live service games after a while of not playing, and the game is just like, hey, you've missed, um, literally, like, seven years of patches and updates and changes.
[57:06.74]Uh, here's, like, ten pop-up windows to explain to you every massive, monumental, fucking ridiculous change we've made over the last five years.
[57:16.18]It's just... I don't even know where to start.
[57:20.36]I want to start.
[57:24.11]And it's not an excuse.
[57:26.47]Because there's plenty of... You know, if you really care, you'll do it.
[57:30.47]But I think it was just the prospect of not ever paying attention.
[57:36.28]And having to... And even the stuff they were talking about at ExileCon was like, holy shit, this is so cool.
[57:41.02]You can make a roguelike dungeon and trade it.
[57:44.06]And wait, this is... They're bringing this back.
[57:47.02]Oh, by the way, like Ster was telling me, there's like, there's like 15 different end game, like, whole zones to, like, care about and, like, make a character around.
[57:55.37]Oh, by the way, there's like 7,000 uniques in the game.
[57:58.27]It's like, holy shit, that sounds like the, that sounds like my favorite game ever made.
[58:01.87]My favorite game ever made is D2.
[58:03.82]It's just a fact.
[58:04.98]It just is.
[58:06.92]What I liked about D2 that's not in a lot of the ARPGs now is its incredible simplicity.
[58:15.62]It was very simple.
[58:16.86]It was very easy to understand.
[58:18.94]But, like, I could be an item find barbarian if I wanted to.
[58:25.28]I think that's what I like the most about it.
[58:28.28]There's like 30 moves this character has.
[58:30.10]Do you want to be a raven druid?
[58:32.06]I mean, is that stupid?
[58:33.34]Maybe, but who cares?
[58:34.24]Put 20 points into it and have fun.
[58:37.08]That's what I'm looking for.
[58:42.52]D2 was the worst Diablo game.
[58:43.90]I mean, you're literally talking about... Like, my entire identity is based around this game.
[58:48.10]So, like, you're... That's a personal attack.
[58:54.83]Not Doom 2.
[58:59.25]That was a personal attack.
[59:00.61]No, not Destiny 2.
[59:02.03]Diablo II.
[59:03.13]What?
[59:07.57]D2.
[59:08.21]Diablo II.
[59:08.83]Not Destiny 2.
[59:13.69]I played a little bit of Destiny 2.
[59:14.73]It was fun.
[59:15.37]It was alright.
[59:16.07]I didn't really get into it, but I could understand why people played it.
[59:24.07]But I thought about this the other day.
[59:26.45]What is it about seeing the beige, kind of beige golden letters on the ground?
[59:33.47]It's the fact that I kind of don't even know what it is.
[59:36.05]And even if it sucks, who cares?
[59:37.93]It's got, like, cool artwork.
[59:40.25]And I can give that to, like, my level 3 Amazon.
[59:43.85]It's like a level 5 unique, and the thing's a piece of shit.
[59:47.20]The thing sucks, but who cares?
[59:50.18]It's like a fun little thing to collect, and it's got custom art for each little piece.
[59:55.88]I can keep it in a little inventory.
[60:01.33]Everything feels like handmade.
[60:05.15]It all feels handmade.
[60:07.69]What don't you like about D4's uniques?
[60:10.67]First of all, there's like...
[60:12.63]When I played D... I played a lot of D4 off stream.
[60:14.60]I really did.
[60:14.96]I'll give you my real... I'm going to give you the real take.
[60:16.44]Because I know I've been... I haven't been giving you the real one.
[60:22.20]I just don't like the aspects.
[60:24.96]I just really don't like that system.
[60:26.36]I haven't liked the legendary system since D3.
[60:29.56]And they leaned even more heavily into it.
[60:35.47]I would rather...
[60:38.09]Instead of legendaries with legendary powers, just get rid of that entire system.
[60:42.85]And just have, like, three fucking hundred uniques in the game and have them all fun and interesting.
[60:46.96]And have them unique.
[60:47.76]And have them have cool artwork.
[60:48.76]And let me collect them.
[60:50.50]That's it.
[60:50.84]That's what I want.
[60:52.30]That's what I want.
[60:52.92]That's all I want.
[60:54.30]And then somebody would just say, just play D2.
[60:55.94]Yeah.
[60:56.64]That's true.
[60:58.04]D2 got remastered.
[60:59.20]And the remaster is very, very good.
[61:01.49]Yeah.
[61:01.63]Yeah.
[61:02.71]You're right.
[61:04.01]You're right.
[61:04.55]You're absolutely right.
[61:06.37]But I've kind of been waiting for a D2 sequel for like 30 years.
[61:12.69]Do you know what I mean?
[61:13.29]It's just like, God damn it.
[61:15.05]I, I just want, I want D2 more.
[61:17.53]I want like D2 too.
[61:20.22]Does that make me an old boomer?
[61:21.36]Probably, but that's just how I feel.
[61:24.10]That's Diablo 3.
[61:25.30]Diablo 3 is not Diablo II too.
[61:32.09]Diablo 3 is the base for Diablo 4, which is why I prefer Diablo II.
[61:38.00]The Diablo II item system, I think, and plus, think about gems.
[61:42.82]I liked just collecting them, and you could make them, and it's like, oh wow, I've got like five perfect topazes.
[61:48.78]Throw that shit into a 5-6 socket chest, give yourself some magic fine, and go have a goddamn fucking fun time killing Mephisto four times in a row.
[61:58.06]Who cares?
[62:02.67]PoE has gems.
[62:03.43]I'm going to play PoE.
[62:04.87]I'm going to play it.
[62:06.93]Jerma, none of those words are in the Bible.
[62:12.64]No, they're not.
[62:14.42]Are they?
[62:14.74]Is the word gem?
[62:16.20]It might be.
[62:19.87]In my honest opinion, Diablo 4 kind of... They kind of just made this game where it was just... It wasn't about the fact that they made the game.
[62:30.65]It was the fact that they wanted you to just play it.
[62:33.35]It wasn't about making the game.
[62:34.75]It was about making sure you play it.
[62:37.41]Do you understand what I mean by that?
[62:38.37]Does anybody get that?
[62:42.23]Does anybody understand what I mean by that?
[62:45.67]It's not about the game being good.
[62:48.42]It's about making sure you play it.
[62:56.01]And let me be very, very clear.
[62:58.51]I do think that the Diablo 4 devs really do want to have a good game.
[63:02.03]I think they really want to make a great experience.
[63:04.02]And you know what?
[63:04.64]Over the next few years, they probably will.
[63:07.94]They'll probably make a pretty fleshed out endgame system.
[63:11.36]But the core of Diablo 4, the very fundamentals of that game, I do not like.
[63:17.81]So, Diablo II, I don't think I'm ever going to get the sequel that I ever really wanted.
[63:26.45]And that's alright.
[63:36.97]Oh my god, gone are the days of Centrist Andy.
[63:46.32]No, but that's just how I feel.
[63:48.56]That's just the truth of how I feel.
[63:52.26]There are a lot of people that really, really liked D4.
[63:55.35]I'm not going to tell you that you are stupid or wrong for liking D4 a lot.
[63:59.51]I'm not going to say that to you because if you like it, then you like it.
[64:03.49]I'm not going to tell you that you can't like it.
[64:06.63]I'm just going to tell you that I don't.
[64:07.75]Okay.
[64:14.67]You already said that.
[64:15.65]Wait, when did I say that?
[64:17.35]I'm going to die.
[64:26.40]But nothing will ever hit the same as finding, you know... And I want to identify items!
[64:32.97]I want to identify items!
[64:37.17]Do you know what I mean?
[64:38.41]I don't want to just pick up a bunch of shit and just have it be a mess in my inventory.
[64:42.97]And it's just green and red letters.
[64:46.05]Which one has green letters?
[64:47.27]Which one has red letters?
[64:49.75]Everything has a percentage on it.
[64:51.46]Everything's a percentage.
[64:53.18]Percentage to percentage of a percentage to this percentage.
[64:55.84]I want real numbers.
[64:57.46]I don't want percentages.
[64:58.16]Give me a number.
[64:58.62]I'm going off.
[65:07.13]I don't want, like, the 20% chance to do 10% more vulnerability damage if you have 10% more... No, I just... Give me... I want 25 dexterity on that item.
[65:16.68]And I want the art to look really cool, because there's a lot of talented artists and shit.
[65:19.82]And I want it to have beige letters, and I want to have a big collection box where I can put these items.
[65:26.15]And I want to trade them.
[65:27.63]I want to be able to fucking... I want to be able to... I lost, but whatever.
[65:31.66]He's still going.
[65:32.42]Okay.
[65:38.05]Nobody talks shit about Diablo more than somebody that says Diablo is my favorite game.
[65:45.87]Yeah, you've got me here.
[65:48.78]You do got me.
[65:50.12]But let me tell you, let me just try to make it as clear as I can.
[65:54.38]Diablo II was such an unbelievable genre-defining experience.
[66:01.72]Like, nothing really was ever really like that.
[66:03.48]There was a couple things, kind of.
[66:06.06]But they just paved the whole road for every action RPG that came after it.
[66:11.84]And it's hard to play a game that's supposed to be a Diablo sequel.
[66:17.99]Diablo II, Diablo 3, a numbered sequel?
[66:21.09]And have, in my opinion, they go so far away from what made me like Diablo so much that it's not really even a numbered sequel for me anymore.
[66:32.78]DOE is better than D2?
[66:36.20]I think PoE has had a lot more time to be developed.
[66:40.86]Diablo II was done by Blizzard North.
[66:43.42]They just kind of made the game and it released.
[66:45.20]There wasn't like a bunch.
[66:45.86]I mean, they did patches and they added stuff and that like ladder and everything and D2, the expansion, everything.
[66:50.82]But PoE has been continuously developed for about 10 years.
[66:54.71]Who is he talking to?
[66:56.93]Um, you.
[66:57.85]I'm talking to you.
[67:02.90]How can you call yourself a Diablo fan when you dislike 75% of Diablo games?
[67:06.22]I don't dislike Diablo 1.
[67:09.06]I think Diablo 1 was almost like an experiment.
[67:11.48]I think Diablo II was the first, like... Diablo is a big game that everybody cares about now.
[67:17.19]I think Diablo 1 was more of, like, an awesome experiment.
[67:23.22]Alright, I'm going for it.
[67:24.34]I want to do the first mission.
[67:25.44]I feel like I was doing pretty good in that one.
[67:32.21]Diablo 1's a good time, yeah?
[67:35.94]Alright, I'm going for it this time.
[67:36.88]I'm gonna go right to the scroll.
[67:46.93]I like random I just don't like everything is random and everything is random to an extent let me give you an example I know and I know this is like finally he like took he like is he's finally giving his diablo 4 take I know but it's been a while it's been a long time coming so uh what was I what was I just gonna say I actually just forgot everything what was the last sentence I said
[68:12.78]What was the last sentence I said?
[68:13.74]I was looking at reading the thing up there.
[68:16.54]What was the last thing I said?
[68:19.18]Random.
[68:19.46]Okay, random.
[68:20.12]Yeah, I like random, but I don't like when things are too random, but they're random in a box.
[68:24.65]Let me give you an example.
[68:27.61]For instance, in D4, if I wanted to make a charged bolt sorcerer, right?
[68:36.99]There are items in the game that completely change charge bolts, right?
[68:42.39]There's also, you can get plus to charge bolts on a pair of gloves, or I think it's legs, whatever it is.
[68:48.77]But that can only appear on a certain couple pieces of gear.
[68:53.56]Why can't it roll on everything else?
[68:56.46]Why can't plus to charge bolts roll on anything?
[68:59.26]Why does it have to roll on like one item only in one specific slot?
[69:07.56]Why?
[69:09.26]What if I want to try to get, like, a bunch of points into Charge Bulls?
[69:11.92]Why can't I just put it on a bunch of shit?
[69:16.98]And every item seems to, like... I don't know, it just feels like when I do a bunch of runs, like, oh, I'm going to do some Nightmare Dungeons, and then I'm going to do Helltide or whatever.
[69:25.77]Alright, cool.
[69:26.63]I have a full inventory of shit, of, like, a bunch of legendaries and rares, and you scroll over them, and you're like, I don't even know what the fuck half of this shit even is saying to me.
[69:35.57]Like, what even is better?
[69:38.47]And just salvage the whole inventory.
[69:40.01]It's just like, I guess.
[69:41.55]I mean, I found the distant enemies are stunned like eight times.
[69:46.82]And I guess I'm just going to keep one of them.
[69:48.90]I had a full inventory.
[69:51.16]I had a full stash of aspects that I was just like, these are all... I don't even know what the fuck to do with these.
[69:57.65]Dude, stop being a nerd.
[69:58.57]People are leaving.
[69:59.15]Hey, I've been pressed to give my Diablo 4 take for like two months.
[70:04.21]And I haven't given it.
[70:04.95]And I'm giving it to you now.
[70:13.20]TL;DR in Diablo II, even when a piece of shit unique drops.
[70:19.41]You just see the beige letters and you go, ooh!
[70:23.01]When like a legendary ring drops in D4, I don't even fucking care.
[70:27.83]I just don't, I don't even care.
[70:30.44]It's just like, oh, that's just going to be a bunch of random stats and a random aspect.
[70:34.80]I don't even care.
[70:36.10]And you pick it up and it's just like, okay, is this like 1% better than the one aspect of this that I already have?
[70:40.54]I don't know.
[70:41.46]I guess like, I just throw it away, I guess.
[70:49.22]Your TL;DR is way too long.
[70:54.18]Is beige really a deal breaker?
[70:55.56]Yeah, it kind of is.
[70:59.19]And because to me, aesthetic matters a lot to me.
[71:06.27]I wanna be able to, like, pick that item up.
[71:07.91]Like, what was that big mall in D2?
[71:10.91]Bonesnap, right?
[71:12.75]And when you identify it, it, like, whoa, there's the artwork!
[71:16.67]Right?
[71:16.85]You remember that shit?
[71:18.41]Remember that shit?
[71:19.77]Hey!
[71:20.53]Remember that shit?
[71:21.95]Remember when you actually identified it and the artwork showed up?
[71:26.87]Give me, I want the items to have, like, weight.
[71:29.01]I want them to fucking have visuals.
[71:30.69]I don't want them to just be, like, a bunch of fucking rolled stats.
[71:33.07]I don't give a shit about any of that.
[71:34.11]I don't care about any of that.
[71:40.97]Go get the scroll.
[71:42.05]Oh, yeah, I will.
[71:44.17]Do the D4 ramp, but do it in a Quagmire voice now.
[71:47.13]Hey, Peter.
[71:51.45]Diablo 4.
[71:52.78]Alright.
[71:54.00]It's actually kind of a... I'm not a big fan of it, Peter.
[72:14.25]That hurt me physically.
[72:17.87]Worse than the Deadpool routine?
[72:20.31]You know, I will stand by the Deadpool routine.
[72:23.91]I thought that was a good time.
[72:25.85]I think some of you are hating on the Deadpool routine.
[72:28.35]And you didn't even get it.
[72:30.37]I don't think you got it.
[72:31.25]You didn't get it.
[72:34.49]I just don't think you got it.
[72:36.23]You know what I mean?
[72:36.95]I really think you just didn't get it.
[72:38.61]Yeah.
[72:40.15]Some of you got it, but a lot of you didn't, and a lot of you, like, hate my Deadpool.
[72:44.25]Some of you get it.
[72:54.04]I was reeling in pain.
[72:57.52]Yeah.
[72:59.38]It's alright.
[73:02.26]Alright, I'm going to get the scroll.
[73:03.36]I'm not.
[73:04.08]Wait, let's read this.
[73:06.87]The trays of blood led us into the darkness, where two morbid shrines awaited.
[73:11.85]Each of them demanded a sacrifice in exchange for a fragment of a powerful token.
[73:17.19]The token of pain, which betrayed its old master.
[73:21.15]The token of pain!
[73:22.81]To finally end his atrocious reign.
[73:30.58]Go get the scroll, Madge.
[73:32.49]I'm going.
[73:33.55]I'll get it.
[73:39.98]I am 100% going to play PoE 2.
[73:42.36]I will.
[73:44.14]PoE 1, when the new league comes out, I'll definitely check it out.
[73:47.78]I already played a little bit of Path of Exile, just because, you know, obviously, Ster plays a lot.
[73:51.67]And he's like, this is my favorite game.
[73:52.99]Please, I know you like D2.
[73:54.53]Please, for the love of God, play it.
[73:56.29]Why do you keep not playing this?
[73:57.61]You keep saying D2 is your favorite game ever.
[73:59.67]Why won't you play the game that is supposed to be a successor to that game you love so much?
[74:05.29]Why?
[74:05.63]There's like 70...
[74:06.67]There's like 10 years worth of content.
[74:08.90]You'll never get to the end of it.
[74:10.42]And I go, maybe with a Diablo 4 might patch in some more uniques.
[74:18.23]It's not going to happen.
[74:18.81]It's not going to happen.
[74:24.01]When I heard that Diablo 4 was bringing uniques back, I rejoiced.
[74:28.85]I was like, we are going back to the old Diablo II style.
[74:32.99]It's going to be uniques.
[74:34.23]It's going to be so... Oh, our aspects are back.
[74:38.94]And they just... You can pull them off and you have to stick them on a rare.
[74:43.48]And then everything's kind of like... There's no value on anything.
[74:46.20]And you can't even trade with somebody in your own fucking party.
[74:49.92]And...
[74:51.22]Trading doesn't matter anyways because you get the same piece of gear over and over again because it's like the smart loot with the class and then everything's scaled and... Which is one of the good ones here.
[75:12.13]I just want crafted items back.
[75:16.15]You're always complaining, dude.
[75:17.29]Enjoy yourself for once.
[75:19.88]I don't think I'm complaining a lot.
[75:21.76]I'm always... What?
[75:22.54]No, I'm not.
[75:24.57]I give a lot of benefit of the doubt to a lot of games.
[75:30.63]I'll try.
[75:30.89]Yeah, I'll do ring blades.
[75:41.50]Alright, now I actually... I'm going to level up one more time and I'm going to go get the thing down there.
[75:53.93]It's so funny because do you remember when I played the D4 beta on stream?
[75:58.29]I was going into that with, ooh, uh, yeah.
[76:02.79]I remember saying very, very clearly, it was like, this feels kind of fun.
[76:07.30]The first five to 10 levels of D4, I was like, holy shit, this is going to be the best game I've ever played in my entire life.
[76:13.02]I didn't want to say it on stream because I don't, I didn't want to be like, you know, jumping the gun, right?
[76:17.95]Turns out it was not the case at all.
[76:20.43]It was almost the complete opposite.
[76:29.91]And I remember saying on stream, hold on.
[76:33.09]I love this, but I don't, I gotta be really careful.
[76:35.60]I don't, what if I'm going to give it some more time?
[76:38.12]I'm so glad I said that.
[76:45.00]All I remember from that was grip gate.
[76:51.03]You know, that's like.
[76:54.05]Part of that makes me kind of happy because of all like the weird dumb shit that we talk about on these streams.
[76:59.67]The fact that the one thing that you remembered from that whole thing was not the fact that of like my opinion of Diablo.
[77:04.93]It was the fact that we talked about like somebody's grip.
[77:09.72]And nothing else mattered on that stream, right?
[77:11.90]So like we go over a lot on these streams and it's kind of almost refreshing to know that the only thing that you particularly care about is like me talking about somebody's grip.
[77:27.86]He wanted to say Cyclops drip.
[77:31.23]Yeah.
[77:33.31]And my compressor cut it off.
[77:34.49]Alright.
[77:40.40]Now I'm actually officially going to go get the parchment.
[77:46.40]I know people like bring back rune words.
[77:48.30]I don't really necessarily care too much about rune words.
[77:50.60]I just want the socketable items to feel good.
[77:55.37]It didn't feel bad putting a shitty-ass, chipped-ass gem in some piece-of-shit gear that you knew you were going to use for, like, five levels.
[78:05.31]That was actually useful.
[78:07.23]I almost feel like the whole gem system in D4 is completely fucking meaningless.
[78:11.84]It is 100% meaningless.
[78:15.74]Maybe one of them?
[78:17.36]I'm giving you my D4 take.
[78:24.02]I feel like your rant is meaningless.
[78:26.54]I mean, I guess it kind of is.
[78:29.88]But don't you think my rant about like what kind of peanut butter is my favorite is also pretty meaningless?
[78:36.67]I mean, I guess this has a little bit of substance.
[78:46.14]Okay, definitely the orbs.
[78:48.68]These things are awesome.
[78:55.56]That would be more entertaining.
[78:57.74]Yeah, I'm telling you how I feel.
[79:02.90]That's what I'm doing.
[79:03.44]Alright, give me something good.
[79:18.42]1% attack speed for five seconds for each killed enemy.
[79:23.16]That feels great.
[79:27.42]It's that one, right?
[79:28.68]It has to be.
[79:29.74]Yeah, that thing's amazing.
[79:32.55]Every time you kill something for five seconds.
[79:37.77]Up to 50%.
[79:38.09]Is there an indicator where I can see it?
[79:46.69]Oh, it's okay on the right.
[79:47.75]Oh, I need more damage because I'm not killing things fast enough.
[80:02.35]Backspeed.
[80:06.96]Will you ever do a second run of Choose Your Own Diablo in Diablo?
[80:10.04]Oh, sorry.
[80:10.74]Hold on.
[80:12.58]That was pretty fun.
[80:13.26]Hardcore, where you guys pick every point I put in.
[80:17.71]With D2 Remastered, that's much, much easier to do now.
[80:20.91]Oh, boy.
[80:34.30]This might be bad.
[80:44.24]Ah, come on.
[80:44.97]Damn it.
[80:45.85]It's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
[80:49.11]I never got the key to that cage.
[80:51.27]Okay.
[80:52.45]I got money.
[80:59.84]How much do I have?
[81:00.48]I got... Oh my god, I have tons of money.
[81:01.98]I have 4,300 gold.
[81:07.27]Maybe defense.
[81:09.29]Max health defense.
[81:10.25]Try to get... Be able to last a little longer.
[81:12.23]Attack range.
[81:13.71]I'm going to say this one.
[81:20.50]Let's do area and projectile speed.
[81:23.20]Let's see what that said.
[81:27.94]24% bigger projectile.
[81:29.56]I think that's pretty good.
[81:38.29]Alright, let's go.
[81:44.27]Hmm.
[81:44.43]Alright, I'm going to go rescue that guy in the cage.
[81:54.93]Don't skip plus one piercing.
[81:56.39]Yeah, we were talking about Diablo.
[81:58.67]That's my bad.
[82:13.06]Oh yeah, we were talking about gems.
[82:14.04]We were talking about gems, gems, gems.
[82:15.38]Let's talk about gems.
[82:17.26]I remember when you start D2, it's just you're going to use your gems.
[82:24.22]You're going to put a flawed Topaz in this busted up piece of shit one-handed axe you found, and you're going to get a little bit of lightning damage, and you're going to notice it.
[82:38.08]Here we go again.
[82:41.91]Uh...
[82:43.67]Oh, okay.
[82:44.71]Alright, give me another topic.
[82:46.27]Give me another topic.
[82:48.31]Give me another topic.
[82:49.03]Jeez, man.
[82:49.71]You're still on... It's been like an hour?
[82:51.19]What do you want me to talk about?
[82:53.96]Talk about Wendy's?
[82:55.38]I like their nuggets.
[83:08.05]What's the best jam for peanut butter?
[83:11.45]Uh, that would be grape jelly or grape jam.
[83:18.31]In fact, I haven't had it in a long time, but they make this product where it's this weird spiral of 50-50 peanut butter and grape jam inside the same container.
[83:31.64]And there was a point when I was eating that shit out of the jar.
[83:35.28]I was eating it out of the jar.
[83:38.31]for like 30 straight minutes, and I realized what was going on, and I had to stop it.
[83:43.65]Goobers.
[83:44.25]Yeah.
[83:46.75]N.A.
[83:47.15]Food.
[83:47.49]N.A.
[83:51.36]Food.
[83:51.78]Alright.
[83:52.00]Yeah, well, hey, I'll go ahead and take your crisps and get the fuck out of here, alright?
[84:11.79]I'm gonna eat goobers out of the jar, okay?
[84:26.12]He's really patriotic today.
[84:31.81]uh I've ran I've just we've I've just discussed Diablo II's item system and I eat peanut butter out of the jar does that make me an American is that an American thing is that patriotism is that patriotic let me tell you something about diablo hey give me that jar of peanut butter while I go over this
[85:11.33]What's some good British food?
[85:15.49]Beans, right?
[85:23.17]Nothing.
[85:29.84]The only thing I think of when I think of British food is just like two big fucking sausages on a plate with a bunch of plain beans on it.
[85:41.74]And, like, that's it.
[85:43.22]That's, like, what I think of.
[85:45.07]But I would eat that.
[85:45.89]That sounds pretty damn good.
[85:48.75]Like, that's fine.
[85:49.79]I would be okay with that.
[85:51.43]This is not an insult to an entire country of people's food.
[85:55.77]No, I'm just... That's what I think of.
[85:57.43]I think of, like, two big sausages and, like, plain beans.
[86:00.57]And I think of toast.
[86:01.81]Plain toast.
[86:07.89]That sounds pretty good to me.
[86:11.33]Remember the cage?
[86:12.29]Right, right, right.
[86:12.77]I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[86:17.77]Scones?
[86:19.69]Hmm.
[86:21.72]Alright, who has the best desserts?
[86:24.18]Who has the best desserts?
[86:31.60]France?
[86:39.01]France?
[86:39.15]France has the best desserts?
[86:42.20]I would say, I would say Italy.
[86:53.63]No, no, no, no.
[87:01.27]America and Mexico.
[87:05.19]Yeah, I mean, I... I'm trying to think of what my, like, really favorite desserts are.
[87:10.31]And they are kind of American.
[87:12.21]Unless, like, where did... Like, banana cream pie, for instance.
[87:16.84]Who made that up?
[87:18.46]Where did... Who made the first banana cream pie?
[87:20.94]Who did that?
[87:26.29]Who... What country did it originate from?
[87:37.59]That's your go-to dessert.
[87:38.76]I love banana... Banana cream pie and banana pudding are two of my top desserts ever.
[87:45.06]And those of you that... Oh my god, dude, are you 80?
[87:48.08]Oh yeah, slurp up the banana pudding, right old man?
[87:51.38]No, you've never eaten it.
[87:53.33]You've seen a bunch of old people eat it and you laugh at them, but go eat it.
[87:56.71]Eat it next time.
[87:59.21]And then you come back and talk.
[88:03.81]I know I walked by the guy in the cage, but I really want the abilities first.
[88:10.17]uh believed to have originated in the midwest of the United States okay so that's American it's great too oh what else is I mean like ice cream I love ice cream who doesn't though and where who even made up ice cream anybody even know like what ice cream where was where was ice cream invented
[88:47.48]China ancient Chinese planted the first seeds of modern day ice cream okay 600 a.d in China I love ice cream alright let's go collect and then I'll get this parchment and then we'll go get I have 28 health what happened
[89:24.46]Uh, ice cream.
[89:25.24]What else?
[89:25.66]What else is like another thing up there?
[89:27.10]Peanut cream pie.
[89:31.12]Just like a good chocolate ice cream.
[89:32.88]Alright, I'm going to go this way.
[89:42.96]Tiramisu.
[89:44.50]Tiramisu is really good, but I don't know if I would say Tiramisu is my favorite dessert.
[89:58.79]Okay, that's like the thing in Vampire Survivors.
[90:01.39]Uh, speed.
[90:06.67]What is this gigantic pickup range?
[90:08.07]This is ridiculous.
[90:08.73]Oh my god.
[90:11.97]I want regen.
[90:20.34]Oh, that sucks.
[90:22.80]Oh, that sucks.
[90:25.80]That sucks.
[90:27.68]That's hard.
[90:32.68]Ooh.
[90:34.38]I got a blessing?
[90:35.62]Health... Okay.
[90:37.46]Alright, now I'm gonna open... I'll open that cage now.
[90:39.24]I'm gonna go with melee.
[90:42.44]You suck at this.
[90:43.16]That's fine.
[90:43.62]That's fine.
[90:43.96]I don't care.
[90:48.27]Defense.
[90:49.77]Health regen.
[90:51.49]Wait.
[90:59.39]I want...
[91:03.87]Much more of that.
[91:08.41]Alright, let's go.
[91:14.56]Area size is really good.
[91:17.54]Yeah, I need to do cone size.
[91:19.22]First of all, let me go talk to the guy.
[91:21.37]Let me do the actual mission.
[91:28.28]What instrument is that?
[91:29.32]The thing that goes... What is that thing?
[91:46.75]I want more regen.
[91:47.83]I want to be, I want to be regenning like one health, two health a second.
[91:51.81]We're going to work on that first while it's easy.
[91:57.09]Okay.
[91:57.31]Let's get this done immediately.
[91:59.05]Don't free him.
[92:00.13]Keep him there.
[92:01.01]What's with you?
[92:01.53]What's with you?
[92:24.60]I think having more than four or five slots for gems in Diablo 3 and Diablo II is probably the best part about having the gem system.
[92:33.32]And... I'm kidding.
[92:34.66]I'm not... I got you.
[92:35.58]Got you.
[92:36.49]Got you.
[92:37.97]Got you.
[92:43.55]But no, seriously, like I... Seriously?
[92:47.15]The one to two slots per... It's just you've designed it in a way to make it so it can never be interesting.
[92:53.21]It has to be this calculated thing that you've done where you can have one thing put in this very specific box of randomness.
[93:02.38]I want to be able to throw six perfect fucking topazes into a weapon and waste it and be an idiot.
[93:08.94]I want six perfect emeralds and a shitty sword with 600 poison damage over fucking 12 seconds.
[93:14.30]And I want my friends to make fun of me because I did that.
[93:16.72]When I got it, I got the six gems in that thing.
[93:30.34]Rattle, rattle, rattle.
[93:33.74]No one cares?
[93:34.76]Yeah, they do.
[93:35.48]I think a lot of people care.
[93:37.86]I think a very large amount of people care.
[93:48.35]Hey, and it's my screen, so I'm going to talk about Diablo II gems.
[93:55.27]OK, so.
[94:03.38]Will he just be at the time?
[94:10.87]Dude, will you please read the nice comments?
[94:12.61]I'm a streamer.
[94:13.13]I'm immune to those.
[94:14.09]I only read the ones that say like, hey, dude, like when are you going to put a baseball up your ass?
[94:24.87]God damn it.
[94:25.29]I had so much health there too.
[94:28.41]Alright.
[94:29.29]Cone size.
[94:30.03]There it is.
[94:30.46]Finally.
[94:30.86]There's a lot.
[94:36.34]There's like two or three levels right here.
[94:49.41]Come on.
[94:50.88]There we go.
[94:52.32]I leveled up twice.
[94:55.68]Range and crit.
[94:56.72]Yep.
[95:01.79]Damage and attack speed probably.
[95:03.17]Yeah.
[95:12.76]banana ripeness chart where do you like your banana alright hold on let me actually get it like a decent run and then we'll go over the banana ripeness because it's very specific for me because it depends on what you're doing with it is this is this going into a smoothie are you eating this is this being put on cereal it's very important that we go over that uh I want more defense and health what keeps killing me every time
[95:43.32]I can barely hurt this guy.
[95:48.96]Let me try to burn him.
[96:05.98]Oh, that was an unbelievable amount of damage.
[96:22.76]Alright, so ripeness.
[96:25.90]For a smoothie, I want that shit right before it's rotten.
[96:31.24]I want an overripe banana to be a good sweetener for a smoothie.
[96:36.83]How do you think about that?
[96:38.15]Yeah, I've got, hold on.
[96:39.37]I've currently got Tom Hanks voice.
[96:41.85]Let me, hold on.
[96:48.69]If I want it really sweet.
[96:51.66]I would say, like, a little bit before being overripe is the best place to put it in a smoothie.
[96:56.54]But sometimes you really want it to have that really, like, sugary, sugariness.
[97:01.72]That's disgusting.
[97:02.60]Whatever.
[97:03.94]You don't have to eat it.
[97:07.20]But now, okay, is there peanut butter in it?
[97:08.96]If it's a peanut butter banana smoothie, then I don't want the bananas to be very ripe because I don't want them to overpower the peanut butter flavor.
[97:14.30]But then I don't want to use too much peanut butter because I don't actually want to overpower the banana flavor with the peanut butter.
[97:18.53]It's a very, very, very hard balance to get.
[97:22.96]I'm going all health.
[97:29.10]That was a really bad idea.
[97:31.22]I'll be alright.
[97:43.29]Put it all seriously though.
[97:44.07]Yeah, I like a ripe banana for a smoothie.
[97:47.03]I like a non-ripe, just kind of right in the middle.
[97:49.65]I'm just going to eat it.
[97:51.89]I do like bananas.
[97:54.51]I don't know what I just got, but I think I can... Okay, I don't know what's going on.
[97:57.98]Oh, it's like super speed.
[98:08.50]I just can't kill anything.
[98:11.60]Alright, damage is immediate.
[98:15.16]I need it right now.
[98:19.52]This guy's been walking around for 10 straight minutes.
[98:41.82]Shit.
[98:47.34]Shit!
[98:49.50]Cone size.
[98:49.90]Alright, you have to die.
[98:55.88]I have to get at least this one boss down, right?
[98:59.56]Or can I really say I'm a video game player?
[99:03.78]There we go.
[99:05.20]Okay, I hope I'm not instantly dead.
[99:06.76]But I'm going to do arcane splinters because we haven't seen it.
[99:18.72]What are your thoughts on Twitter being called X?
[99:20.40]I don't care.
[99:22.50]I use that app like once a month.
[99:27.26]Okay, what about this one here?
[99:28.82]I don't like the projectile size reduction.
[99:44.79]I'll take it.
[99:45.14]Alright, what does it do?
[99:50.56]They stay?
[99:51.02]Ooh, they... I think they... Yeah, they're still doing damage when they stay.
[99:56.04]Alright, I don't want to lose this because this has... I have an opportunity here to do pretty good.
[100:03.09]Let's regen a little.
[100:04.09]Don't get hurt.
[100:06.29]Go get the other parchment.
[100:08.53]This is where it always goes to shit.
[100:10.59]I'd like to... Okay, I'm dead.
[100:12.35]Oh, that was fun.
[100:19.63]Alright, I got the wellkeeper now.
[100:20.77]What does he do?
[100:25.41]Alright, what's up with you?
[100:28.25]Wellkeeper.
[100:29.01]Okay.
[100:29.35]I had a dream where you made fun of my chat message and literally made chat bully me.
[100:34.72]Um...
[100:52.01]This well has dried up a long time ago.
[100:55.17]Now it leads to the very halls you helped me escape.
[100:57.85]Are you eating a full breakfast?
[100:59.23]Make sure you eat a full breakfast in the morning.
[101:01.69]I might want to drop a trinket into the bucket.
[101:04.01]Alright, I need to pay attention.
[101:05.27]What does this say?
[101:06.79]And make it available to you up here.
[101:09.35]What do you say?
[101:11.19]This well has dried up a long time ago.
[101:12.75]Now it leads to the very halls you helped me escape.
[101:14.85]But if you ever happen to find the other end, you might want to drop a trinket into the bucket.
[101:23.73]Huh?
[101:25.81]Whoa!
[101:33.70]I can just put these on?
[101:36.26]I have an entire stash of items that I just wasn't wearing.
[101:42.63]Do I have to buy these?
[101:43.69]Wait.
[101:47.62]10% health-free defense.
[101:50.52]15% movement speed.
[101:51.24]20% attack speed.
[101:53.69]A shitload... Okay.
[101:59.31]Well, it says you own them.
[102:01.07]Attack speed, 10% more health, and defense.
[102:06.45]Alright.
[102:08.23]This is really cool.
[102:09.35]Are there rarities?
[102:11.81]Are there... Uniques in this game?
[102:24.48]Your webcam is on and your balls are out.
[102:26.18]Whatever.
[102:26.46]I don't care.
[102:35.14]You have a ring, too.
[102:36.07]Do I?
[102:37.89]Oh, it's actually on the character, too.
[102:39.43]Or am I making that up?
[102:50.15]I don't think I got out with it.
[102:52.91]You can buy new items from the wellkeeper once you've retrieved them through the well.
[102:59.10]So there's something down there where I can put items up there.
[103:06.12]There are kids here.
[103:06.92]What are you doing?
[103:08.44]They really shouldn't be.
[103:09.28]They just shouldn't be.
[103:11.98]They really shouldn't be at all.
[103:13.14]Okay.
[103:18.02]Here we go.
[103:23.72]I want to do... I'm going to try to get a full run Haunted Caverns.
[103:28.60]Adults only?
[103:30.26]I mean, you know, I've had the mature audience filter on this stream for like eight years.
[103:38.69]I just never turned it off because, I mean, we talk about kind of weird shit on this stream.
[103:44.38]Alright.
[103:45.22]Right off the bat, huge deal.
[103:49.63]It's not working clearly.
[103:51.31]It's not working.
[103:57.54]It's not working.
[104:00.26]Bananas are adult content only.
[104:02.34]Yeah, you guys missed it.
[104:08.24]We just talked about bananas for at least 10 straight minutes.
[104:20.73]Alright.
[104:21.79]Damage.
[104:22.71]Damage.
[104:23.29]Damage.
[104:23.81]Damage.
[104:24.74]Damage.
[104:28.56]I... It took me 10 minutes to get to 104 last time.
[104:31.74]I want to be doing 200 damage before that first boss shows up.
[104:40.45]More.
[104:40.75]Here we go.
[105:02.97]This is the one.
[105:04.57]It actually might be because I've leveled up like three times in 25 seconds.
[105:10.12]Alright, attack speed.
[105:11.34]We're going for damage only.
[105:19.22]Already at 228 crits.
[105:22.54]Might as well just sign the paperwork now.
[105:28.50]This is a done deal.
[105:43.48]Good.
[105:44.02]Look at that.
[105:45.66]Already got a cone with already, but wait.
[105:50.04]Cone or crit?
[105:57.39]Which one?
[106:01.19]Cat ages in dog years.
[106:16.74]Cone, Omega Lull.
[106:17.98]Everybody said Cone!
[106:18.89]I was going to pick Cone too, so that's what I've decided.
[106:22.13]I'm getting a lot better at actually physically clearing.
[106:34.83]Which is what I really should be doing.
[106:40.81]10% damage.
[106:42.13]Ah, yep.
[106:42.85]I have to go.
[106:43.49]I gotta go for it.
[106:47.02]These guys take two hits.
[106:48.02]Gotta try to get them down and take like one.
[106:50.53]I already took damage.
[106:52.83]I might as well just fucking uninstall the fucking goddamn game.
[107:06.94]Dude, chill.
[107:07.88]I'm fine.
[107:08.30]I'm fine.
[107:10.26]range or health let's go no we're going damage alright let's get let's kill this guy quick don't let him just walk around for 15 minutes there's the well you can tell he's mad I'm really not I'm just messing around
[107:50.55]Already, okay, already got the first item.
[107:52.59]Phantom Needles, let's go.
[107:55.59]That's a good thing for melee, because it just kind of randomly hits stuff around me.
[107:58.31]Yeah.
[108:12.46]Alright, give me an item so I can drop it in the well.
[108:18.21]When are you going to play PoE on stream?
[108:26.16]I don't think I might not.
[108:28.08]I mean, maybe me and Ster would play it just to mess around for like an afternoon or something, but that's an off stream game for me.
[108:34.25]I mean, I mean, no, not necessarily.
[108:43.07]I mean, with the kind of direction that I was telling you guys about with the channel and everything and more of these streams where I'm just kind of hanging around, nothing too crazy going on, just chilling.
[108:54.34]Maybe I would just play PoE and just do runs or something.
[109:05.08]There it is.
[109:07.75]Is the cone-sized thing a joke?
[109:10.70]Actually, it kind of doesn't feel like it.
[109:11.80]It feels like I'm killing things a lot faster now.
[109:25.18]Play Slime Rancher?
[109:29.51]No, you silly Billy.
[109:30.89]Can you play more Roblox?
[109:34.27]I think...
[109:35.51]I'm trying to set up a MVM.
[109:37.83]I've got five people that are willing to do MVM.
[109:42.54]I think that'd be really fun.
[109:45.18]Also, I want to open some crates too.
[109:52.03]I just have a bunch of different cases from the last six or seven years just sitting in my backpack and I just don't even really know what to do with them.
[110:04.27]I don't want to do something like an egregious amount, right?
[110:08.25]But maybe like 20.
[110:10.07]Open up like 10 to 25 cases or something.
[110:24.38]Open a case after every death.
[110:27.75]That would get... That would get a little ridiculous, I think.
[110:35.88]Attack speed.
[110:37.52]Or crit.
[110:38.26]Or maybe pickup range.
[110:39.08]Attack speed.
[110:49.51]Yeah.
[110:54.82]I was thinking movement speed, but it's just low.
[110:56.88]6% is not very much.
[111:10.50]Alright, I'm doing a lot better now.
[111:18.44]Alright, decision time.
[111:31.71]That's big.
[111:33.47]This is also big.
[111:35.05]They're all big.
[111:37.94]I really actually don't know.
[111:38.78]They're all good.
[111:44.70]Cone width or speed and damage?
[111:48.60]Always damage.
[111:50.90]Yeah, that's true.
[111:52.44]Alright, first boss should be coming any second now.
[112:10.59]Did you get the well guy?
[112:11.51]Yes.
[112:12.85]I don't have any items to put into the well, though.
[112:16.59]So if I put items into the well, do they go away for this run?
[112:19.32]I feel like you just immediately deposit any item you find, regardless of if it's better.
[112:25.42]Yeah, defense and crit damage.
[112:39.98]I'm killing this guy so much faster than the last like five attempts.
[112:47.77]What?
[112:50.17]Oh.
[112:54.31]That's the well.
[112:55.29]Okay, I just like walked into it.
[112:59.88]Well, we might be depositing something right now.
[113:07.60]Oh, shit.
[113:24.86]What is it?
[113:26.34]Ooh.
[113:28.16]Ooh!
[113:32.06]Critical strike damage by 40%.
[113:34.94]We're dropping that into the well.
[113:38.37]Uh-huh.
[113:46.61]What is the thing in the top right?
[113:47.59]What is that?
[113:48.37]Is that the, uh, kind of attract thing?
[113:58.76]Cool.
[114:00.26]Cone size.
[114:08.00]That's my health.
[114:08.86]That's a magnet.
[114:09.46]Okay.
[114:11.58]Should I make my way up there or should I get the... No, I'll get the parchment first.
[114:14.11]Do I have to buy that item from the vendor?
[114:26.53]My pickup range is so bad.
[114:33.58]Let's get an ability.
[114:34.60]I don't have one yet and it's been like eight minutes.
[114:48.67]Plus 10% additional attacks.
[114:50.05]Ooh, yeah.
[114:53.83]Double hits.
[115:02.44]Sing, bro.
[115:03.60]No.
[115:06.93]Bro, sing!
[115:15.52]I want everyone to just relax for a sec because I've got something to tell you.
[115:19.96]We have officially confirmed.
[115:22.14]Officially.
[115:23.56]That hit sound.
[115:27.34]The needles that are going out.
[115:28.81]Officially confirmed.
[115:30.47]That is the Plants vs. Zombies pellet hitting a zombie that has a bucket on their head.
[115:37.03]Sound effect.
[115:49.23]That has been officially not confirmed by anybody but me.
[116:02.82]Alright.
[116:03.72]The projectiles are absolutely killer.
[116:05.42]Ah, it's killer.
[116:18.14]Damage again.
[116:18.80]Alright, I don't want to get... Hold on.
[116:29.48]There's so much EXP here.
[116:39.61]Damage.
[116:42.17]There's so much EXP.
[116:43.65]I have to just leave it.
[116:45.13]I'll wrap around.
[116:49.44]Oh my goodness.
[116:50.00]I think this is invulnerability.
[116:51.16]Give me this.
[117:05.25]Shit.
[117:07.11]Shit.
[117:13.06]Are you an archer or kind of a barbarian kind of guy?
[117:15.46]I am more of a ranged damage kind of fan.
[117:20.03]But I do like melee characters.
[117:23.87]Uh, this one.
[117:36.76]Alright, I'm leaving.
[117:41.61]Another centrist take.
[117:48.70]Add it to the list.
[117:49.66]Another centrist take on Jerma985.
[117:58.99]Fucking Sag.
[118:02.41]Ooh.
[118:02.89]Is that good?
[118:06.95]I don't know if that's even good on this character.
[118:14.92]I mean, I already pierced with my weapon, right?
[118:16.74]Or does that work for the ability, too?
[118:22.72]It's only for the ability.
[118:23.80]Ooh, maybe it is good.
[118:32.14]It is going through them now.
[118:33.40]Cool.
[118:40.05]What did this guy do to piss off so many skeletons?
[118:45.13]You know, I thought about this the other day.
[118:46.30]I mean, have we talked about this, but, like, the prospect of, like, oh, the bandits.
[118:53.12]Look out, adventurer.
[118:54.04]Make sure to kill the bandits that are surrounding us.
[118:57.58]There are, like, 70,000 fucking bandits in every video game and, like, 12 people that live in the town.
[119:04.10]What's going on here?
[119:07.30]There are more bandits than people that live in any of these towns, like, times 100.
[119:23.76]At some point, are they bandits, or is that just the entire human population outside?
[119:31.08]Ah, a pack of bandits surround our camp.
[119:33.52]It's me, you, that lady over there.
[119:37.92]And a healing well.
[119:39.76]Adventurer, go out and stop the encroaching bandits.
[119:45.56]It's about as big as a small country's worth of people out there.
[119:51.82]They definitely could have taken that over.
[119:53.93]100%.
[119:53.97]Like in D2, if they just like rushed the rogue encampment, we're all dead.
[120:00.85]They just, they've never tried.
[120:02.27]Do you wear a wig?
[120:06.94]No.
[120:28.65]Yeah, there's a lot of skeletons too.
[120:30.51]A lot of demons.
[120:40.56]I think this is an automatic.
[120:41.96]I mean, but this one's good too though.
[120:47.40]10% damage and 10% attack speed is... You can't pick anything else if it's here.
[120:56.37]You just can't.
[121:07.83]Alright, I think a boss is incoming here.
[121:10.89]Yep, remember this part?
[121:14.49]Not so tough now, are you?
[121:23.81]Speed.
[121:24.03]Alright, I don't get cocky because this is the first I've ever gotten.
[121:31.80]Get some cheese.
[121:44.88]Lightning Strike here, maybe?
[121:46.01]Or Orbs.
[121:50.09]I have Piercing.
[121:52.23]I don't think this is... I should do the Blades if I have Piercing, right?
[122:04.04]Always Orb?
[122:04.76]Really?
[122:05.44]Even with Piercing?
[122:11.70]I'm going with blades.
[122:14.25]I think the piercing is going to be good.
[122:26.93]I need to pick up this shit so bad.
[122:28.39]There's so much on the ground.
[122:30.84]Let me pull everybody over here.
[122:54.26]Okay.
[122:55.80]Health and defense.
[122:57.68]Whoa!
[122:58.94]I'm fine.
[123:06.52]I need that thing.
[123:07.65]That thing that sucks everything to me.
[123:10.89]I would level up like five times.
[123:28.55]God damn it.
[123:29.03]Come on.
[123:32.08]That was really, really stupid, but I got a bunch of experience.
[123:35.54]Additional attacks or health.
[123:45.09]I had to do it.
[123:45.63]0.1 additional attacks or the movement speed or health.
[123:54.20]What the fuck is he doing?
[123:55.48]I had to go through there because I had to get the item.
[124:00.08]Bro, this is boring.
[124:00.96]Play Persona 4.
[124:01.50]You're not going to start an account where every day you're going to say, hey, please, Jerma place.
[124:07.64]This is day 50 of Persona 4.
[124:09.50]Let me help you again.
[124:11.02]I probably won't play that ever.
[124:12.86]So don't make one of those.
[124:19.71]Persona 4 is good.
[124:21.03]I know.
[124:22.82]I'm going with the health.
[124:23.92]It might be stupid, but I don't care.
[124:25.10]I want to live.
[124:31.40]Did I tell you guys that I've... It was like, oh man, Persona.
[124:34.26]Persona's such an awesome series.
[124:35.38]Just try it.
[124:36.80]And I... I like... I don't know.
[124:38.92]I downloaded one of them.
[124:40.02]It was like Persona 5.
[124:41.32]But not the actual fucking Persona 5 video game, I guess.
[124:45.12]It was like, hey, this is like not Persona 5.
[124:47.03]But it's like Persona 5.
[124:48.83]But it's not that game.
[124:49.95]I... I don't know what I did.
[124:57.00]Additional attacks.
[125:02.74]You need to focus.
[125:03.46]Yes, I do.
[125:04.34]Thank you.
[125:22.77]There it is.
[125:23.19]Yay.
[125:34.41]Ouch.
[125:49.14]There's so much over here.
[125:55.96]Oh.
[125:58.82]I got it low 30.
[126:02.50]Damage.
[126:18.66]I got him.
[126:25.76]Block strength?
[126:27.26]Health?
[126:27.90]Or... Ooh.
[126:28.92]Probably this one, right?
[126:31.66]And then deposit this immediately.
[126:34.84]Go get the magnet now.
[126:40.88]I don't have any helmets.
[126:42.78]These are terrible.
[126:43.48]I mean, I don't have any helmets though, do I?
[126:47.90]Defense, block strength.
[126:48.84]Yeah, I'm going with health.
[126:49.50]I already have this one.
[126:53.98]A magnet just dropped nearby.
[126:56.36]Really?
[126:57.82]Oh my goodness, it did.
[127:01.50]You're right.
[127:03.78]You're right.
[127:04.10]Let me go get it.
[127:09.31]You can only use the well once per run.
[127:12.33]Oh.
[127:12.45]Alright, well let's level up like 15 times.
[127:18.91]More of cone size.
[127:23.31]Uh, attack speed.
[127:27.83]Uh.
[127:29.40]Piercing.
[127:33.32]And.
[127:33.56]OK, this is a way this is.
[127:37.52]There's a lot of shit up here.
[127:38.38]Hold on.
[127:43.58]OK, alright, alright, I'm gonna give me this role.
[127:50.91]Oh shit.
[127:51.19]It's getting hairy.
[128:00.44]I'm hitting the limit here of my character's strength versus the difficulty of the level.
[128:04.32]I have a lot of money though.
[128:27.05]Get the scroll.
[128:27.71]I know, I'm going, I'm going.
[128:28.62]Look at all that XP.
[128:32.97]I'm gonna make my way back up to get it all.
[128:51.39]I'm going to sneeze, I think.
[128:52.24]I apologize in advance.
[128:53.78]I cannot hit the mute button because... Well, actually, I could pause it, but I don't want to lose the rhythm.
[129:06.08]Jeez.
[129:06.26]There it is.
[129:08.16]5,000 in one run.
[129:10.45]Just do it already.
[129:17.53]Come on.
[129:23.87]Damage.
[129:26.69]Oh, I maxed out the strength thing.
[129:27.75]This would be great if I... If I could win right now, that'd be awesome.
[129:38.60]Oh, you're a guardian of the parchment.
[129:40.98]I can get two of these?
[129:47.69]Well, might as well get all three of them.
[129:49.71]I'll get the orbs.
[129:52.23]Oh, this is the end here.
[129:53.39]Maybe not.
[130:06.34]Jesus.
[130:11.02]Yeah, I don't think so.
[130:15.07]I don't think so.
[130:25.79]Hmm, it's not too bad.
[130:27.61]I see the.
[130:28.07]I had to tank it.
[130:43.82]And that money.

[132:24.29]I'm just going health and defense now to try to live.
[132:26.39]Because I actually might be able to do it.
[132:43.10]Maybe not.
[132:45.20]Weird pattern.
[132:45.80]Okay, health, right?
[132:53.33]Um... Ugh.
[132:56.24]That's ridiculous.
[133:09.87]I'm just going to try to get the the magnet thing.
[133:13.77]If I get health along the way, that's great.
[133:32.98]No, no, no, no, no.

[135:00.24]Necromancer.
[135:05.44]Cool, I gotta do blessing for oh I'm unlocking things to upgrade.
[135:12.49]Interesting.

[135:50.01]I think I'm going to get the pickup range.
[135:51.51]That's pretty good.
[135:54.77]Completed quest, increase XP gain.
[136:00.01]I'll try ranged.
[136:05.18]Attention streamer, please play Pikmin 4.
[136:06.86]I don't know, maybe.
[136:09.68]Maybe one day.
[136:11.60]What's the goal now?
[136:12.32]What am I trying to do?
[136:16.16]Defeat the Lich.
[136:18.16]That's probably the last boss that I just saw.
[136:23.58]Uh, deal 750,000 damage.
[136:27.22]This is not in one run.
[136:28.44]So, just total.
[136:35.81]Kill 50,000 slimes.
[136:39.61]Alright, so we need to do Astronomer's Orb.
[136:49.23]Alright, I want to do Astronomer's Orb.
[136:51.65]Let's do it.
[136:53.11]Okay, cool.
[136:56.47]Ever considered Disco Elysium?
[136:59.45]I've considered it, but I have not played it.
[137:02.80]Alright, where's the strength?
[137:08.26]Didn't I unlock one of these?
[137:09.26]Damage?
[137:09.98]Alright, that's a big deal.
[137:15.52]That's a big deal.
[137:25.91]10%.
[137:25.93]20%.
[137:25.99]Oh, yeah.
[137:27.07]Let me get rid of some of the... I'm not getting diminishing returns for this, right?
[137:32.15]Just like Vampire Spirals.
[137:33.79]Because... Give me the 20% damage.
[137:35.99]Give me the 20% damage and the health regen.
[137:39.93]Alright, let's go.
[137:49.59]This game is fun.
[137:50.05]Let me take a sip.
[137:55.88]Max out health regen.
[137:58.50]That's a good idea.
[138:00.88]Actually a good idea.
[138:02.16]Maybe I'll do that now.
[138:11.25]Hmm.
[138:11.87]Oh, that's some good cider.
[138:13.93]I came pretty close with the melee character.
[138:15.47]Let's see if I can do it with the ranged character.
[138:18.06]Especially with that 20% damage.
[138:20.24]Look at that.
[138:20.56]I'm killing skeletons in one hit.
[138:22.72]That wasn't happening before.
[138:26.16]Whale is right here.
[138:27.38]Already level one.
[138:28.64]Health regen.
[138:29.16]Let's go.
[138:29.60]Let's do it.
[138:29.94]Look at this piercing damage.
[138:37.69]Attack speed already.
[138:38.91]Good start.
[138:53.41]Get the scrolls early, man.
[138:54.47]Yeah, that's a good call.
[138:58.31]That's a good call.
[138:58.87]I'm going to go get it right now.
[139:06.94]You always should be making your way down that way in the first minute or so, right?
[139:15.64]What are your theories of the lore of the game?
[139:17.40]I don't know.
[139:17.70]There's just a lot of dead people.
[139:21.63]These skeletons were once a person.
[139:33.18]That was 9% movement speed.
[139:34.36]Worth it.
[139:43.95]Probably more than one person died.
[139:46.03]Yeah, probably.
[140:05.88]I need to wash my eyes.
[140:12.10]What?
[140:20.07]You need to wash your eyes?
[140:26.49]It's apparently estimated that about 117 billion people have ever been born.
[140:33.86]So is that why they're all outside the rogue encampment?
[140:49.45]Yep.
[140:58.58]Shit, I didn't want to knock that over.
[140:59.82]I want to leave those.
[141:02.92]Get an item right now.
[141:03.86]Oh, I've got 20% more damage to close enemies.
[141:25.61]You know that more than one person has been born today?
[141:27.51]It's kind of wild.
[141:38.35]I said orbs, but there's no orbs here, so we're going to have to go with the needles.
[141:48.27]I feel like I've written something down that I really wanted to go over today.
[141:51.30]I forget what it was.
[141:53.22]I was like, I have to talk about this someday.
[141:57.00]What was it?
[142:00.76]Okay.
[142:10.61]Alright.
[142:10.93]Alright.
[142:14.67]So, you know like the fart sound effect sounds?
[142:19.07]You know, we all know the ones.
[142:20.67]Like that... A fart sound effect.
[142:26.01]Don't you think it's kind of ridiculous that those may have been recorded like 20 or 30 years ago.
[142:33.67]Somebody farted into a mic and it's been used for 30 fucking years.
[142:39.47]Imagine being that guy or being that guy's kids.
[142:43.31]And it's like, yeah, that's me up there.
[142:47.08]I farted into a mic 25 years ago.
[142:51.04]And it's everywhere.
[142:53.02]How would you feel about that?
[143:01.91]Imagine you're just watching a movie or something and you hear your fart.
[143:06.70]You farted.
[143:09.19]Is it embarrassing or is it like, yep, I get a lot of those residuals for the fart sounds I did.
[143:15.27]Yeah.
[143:15.94]I recorded 20 of them and they're all used and they use the same ones from like the same library for the last 30 years.
[143:23.58]About how does, how does that guy feel now that he's like 60?
[143:30.98]I don't know.
[143:39.32]That's a lot of damage.
[143:47.96]A thousand people just left.
[143:50.32]They're obviously not strong enough.
[144:04.13]Alright, royalties.
[144:13.83]Yeah, me and Holly were just sitting there and it's just like, yeah, like we just heard that fart sound.
[144:18.83]That guy did, somebody had to have done that.
[144:26.66]You think that somebody, I saw somebody say that they think it was a mouth.
[144:29.42]Somebody could do, I don't think so.
[144:30.68]Some of those are very, very real.
[144:41.76]I don't know why I just picture... And I don't know.
[144:44.99]You can think I'm fucking stupid for this.
[144:46.89]I just think... I just see some guy...
[144:49.93]Just like, hey, yeah, Bill, we need like, we need a fart sound, I guess.
[144:53.79]I'm just imagining the guy taking this, and it's like a standard microphone.
[144:57.03]The type of microphone that, it's got a long cable connected, long, it's about at least 10 to 15 feet long.
[145:02.92]And it's plugged in somewhere, and it's got that metal top, like a stand-up routine.
[145:08.24]And the guy just puts it like right between his cheeks and just farts right into it.
[145:12.58]He like presses it up there.
[145:15.15]That's what I see.
[145:17.31]18 plus stream.
[145:18.71]It's been there for seven or eight years, okay?
[145:21.57]That warning has been here for... Get the kids out of here.
[145:27.02]Get the kids out of here.
[145:27.86]They never should have been here.
[145:28.82]They shouldn't be here.
[145:29.48]Get the kids out of here.
[145:38.58]Leave kids.
[145:40.18]This is no longer a kid-friendly discussion.
[145:55.95]Your viewers are increasing.
[145:56.98]Carry on.
[146:04.55]I'll take that.
[146:10.91]And don't you think that the audio engineer after Bill, like, put the mic right up to where his ass is and did it, and it ripped it.
[146:17.15]It was just awful.
[146:18.45]Do you think he's like, hey, Bill, that was fucking rancid.
[146:21.53]We should do another one, but this time don't put the microphone, like, up to your asshole.
[146:25.51]You should probably do it a little further away because that was fucking disgusting.
[146:35.39]I imagine just having two headphones on just sitting there and it's like, I don't know if we can.
[146:40.32]I don't think we should put that one in.
[146:52.38]You know what I'm talking about, though.
[146:55.60]All that matters is at least 10 of you get it.
[146:59.46]You know what I mean?
[147:00.76]There's like 13,000, 14,000 people here right now.
[147:02.92]As long as 10 of you understand what I mean by this and you get it, then I'm good.
[147:07.07]Then we're good.
[147:16.30]I'm okay with getting the question marks from like 10 plus thousand people.
[147:20.18]As long as I know like six of you are like, yep, I see it.
[147:25.39]I know what he's, I know what's going on here.
[147:27.17]I get it.
[147:37.54]Lower the bar.
[147:38.34]Yeah.
[147:40.06]Well, that's how I make myself feel better, right?
[147:42.95]I don't care what the 14,000 people said.
[147:45.55]I care about what five of you have to say.
[147:47.91]The five of you that I made up that agree with everything I ever say.
[147:51.43]And there's nobody ever disagrees.
[147:52.95]And it's the five of you.
[147:53.87]I have Avengers in this chat right now.
[147:56.89]And you think it's you.
[147:57.57]You know what I mean?
[147:58.89]Just sitting there like, yeah, it's me.
[148:03.05]I'm the one.
[148:05.49]It's probably a lot.
[148:06.37]How many of you just did that?
[148:21.25]Uh, it's funny.
[148:28.53]Oh, let's talk about TF2 cases.
[148:30.25]I'm curious.
[148:32.11]So.
[148:33.79]They did a thing where.
[148:37.21]Damage, yep.
[148:42.74]What's the next Among Us stream?
[148:43.80]Uh, is it one night only?
[148:56.31]Okay, so cases in TF2.
[148:58.82]I remember the last time I really played, it was you opened up weapons cases.
[149:06.08]But those are no longer a thing.
[149:07.58]It's now paint cases that you can put on most anything.
[149:13.72]And the paint has quality.
[149:16.18]Is that... That's what's going on, right?
[149:24.68]Or...
[149:27.25]So there's cosmetic cases and then there's the paint cases.
[149:30.01]And the paint cases are the old weapons cases.
[149:33.88]But the paint can now go on most main, like number one in your loadout.
[149:43.60]So what is considered a really rare case or a really good case?
[149:53.05]That sounds kind of good.
[149:55.15]When you do not use your main attack for two seconds, your abilities become stronger over time, up to... Damn.
[150:05.27]Winter... Winter 2017.
[150:06.91]I'm not sure which one of these to take.
[150:17.84]I feel like this, the ranged character, really needs to shoot the bow.
[150:26.84]30 or 40 is pretty special.
[150:33.62]Yeah, Holly just reminded me.
[150:37.64]So, let's just take a little bit of a break and go over this.
[150:41.06]Because some of you guys are going to really, really... You're going to like this one.
[150:45.39]Okay.
[150:46.19]Take the ring?
[150:46.61]Alright, well, take the ring.
[150:47.89]While I have a second to give you a quick little story.
[150:50.97]If you had any indication at all of what kind of player is playing the game of Team Fortress...
[150:57.19]So in spawn, when you see that Flog Pyro in spawn, and it's like, what the fuck is that guy doing?
[151:03.41]It might be AFK.
[151:05.63]I got really high and just ate like almost a whole bag of chocolates and AFK'd in the spawn as a Flog Pyro for an entire round.
[151:15.91]If you're wondering who is behind the Flog Pyro, yeah, that's what we do.
[151:21.97]That's what we do.
[151:22.77]And it got me thinking about, holy shit, I just did that.
[151:28.98]I lost that match because of you.
[151:31.66]Yeah.
[151:32.36]I just... I had the vlog out and I was just sitting there just eating chocolate.
[151:36.20]And I was sitting there going, I haven't really done anything this round.
[151:43.61]I think I walked out of the spawn and died once.
[151:45.33]And I think I fell asleep too.
[151:48.61]I think I fell asleep and woke up at the second round.
[151:53.58]So that... If you're curious...
[151:57.09]You're right.
[151:58.05]You're correct.
[152:00.03]I am that Fog Pyro.
[152:04.05]Just wanted to make sure you were aware.
[152:11.54]That really happened.
[152:14.02]Which one of these am I taking?
[152:16.24]Bro, you're like 45.
[152:19.02]Not quite.
[152:20.44]Not quite.
[152:22.94]Take the ring.
[152:27.04]TF2's greatest soldiers.
[152:28.42]Thank you Yeah, and then I walk out of spawn and I get the the the the flog up the what the the meter whatever it's called and It's a sniper.
[152:41.06]It's like dude you you he's way too far away and just holding down the crit fire You're not gonna make it.
[152:48.02]You're not gonna make it flog pyro's listen to me.
[152:50.80]I'm telling you we have to be better We have to be better
[152:56.22]I know we can be.
[152:59.66]Okay, I'll take the ring.
[153:21.67]I really did just eat chocolate for a whole round.
[153:23.81]It was fucked.
[153:29.01]Don't ever use a Liberty Launcher again.
[153:30.70]Hey, I'm going to use whatever item I feel like using.
[153:35.63]This one's really good too, though.
[153:46.00]Well, they were little chocolates.
[153:47.54]They were the little tiny ones.
[153:48.82]So realistically, I probably ate like a bar and a half of chocolate.
[153:52.98]It was just the little Hershey's mini ones.
[153:57.25]Which, you're never ready to eat just one of those.
[153:59.79]I might as well just buy the Hershey's bars, the full bars.
[154:04.15]Because I always just eat a full bar worth of them anyways.
[154:06.81]What's the point of getting the little ones?
[154:10.68]I think 10% tax.
[154:19.11]What about Hershey Kisses?
[154:20.75]Hershey Kisses are good, and I know, I look.
[154:24.33]Dude, hey, man, wait a minute.
[154:28.15]Hershey's tastes like puke.
[154:29.69]Hershey's tastes like somebody puked in your face.
[154:32.93]Yeah, it's, I still don't, I like it.
[154:38.87]Yeah, and if you smell the inside of a bag of M&Ms after there's no M&Ms in it, it smells like somebody shit in your bathroom an hour ago.
[154:44.50]We all know this.
[154:54.41]Uh, it's this one.
[155:03.20]It's always the damage.
[155:05.44]Uh, I need to go deposit this ring because it's really good.
[155:12.50]Jerma, nobody knows this.
[155:18.61]Try it next time.
[155:36.73]10% movement speed?
[155:37.35]Yeah.
[155:38.33]Need to get to that well.
[155:43.88]Hershey's is a terrible chocolate.
[155:45.49]Yeah, but...
[155:48.33]It's hard to beat taking a graham cracker, taking a nice warm marshmallow, squishing it with the two or three blocks of Hershey's and making a little s'more.
[156:02.47]It's just, it hits so different.
[156:04.55]I don't care how gross you think Hershey's is, that hits differently.
[156:07.77]It just does.
[156:08.37]It's very, very good.
[156:16.50]However many fit.
[156:17.86]Sometimes it's two little squares.
[156:20.16]Whatever fits on the graham cracker.
[156:22.98]After you eat European chocolate, you'll never want American chocolate ever again.
[156:26.84]Trust me, I've had a lot of chocolate.
[156:29.10]I've had it.
[156:30.42]From all over the world, I've had chocolate.
[156:32.81]I've had tons of it.
[156:37.63]I've had a lot of Kraft cheeseburgers.
[156:40.01]I've had a bunch of steaks before.
[156:41.85]That doesn't mean I'm never going to eat McDonald's ever again.
[156:45.19]Sometimes it's just... You're looking for a different... You're looking for a different feel today.
[156:49.99]A McDonald's cheeseburger is arguably not even remotely close.
[156:55.61]Not even close to a burger you'd get at a nice restaurant.
[156:59.59]But I'm still going to get it sometimes.
[157:07.08]Should I just go full movement speed?
[157:10.64]Piercing?
[157:11.00]Yeah.
[157:11.18]Alright, where's the well?
[157:15.25]Alright, I'm at the 10 minute mark.
[157:16.51]Where's the boss?
[157:27.62]I need more attack speed.
[157:39.61]Grandpa's on the food podcast rant again.
[157:45.26]I'm telling you, do not be surprised.
[157:48.72]Don't be surprised.
[157:49.50]I'm just saying, don't be surprised.
[157:53.02]If when I am retired, there is a food podcast.
[157:56.91]That's like once every few weeks.
[157:59.15]Don't be surprised.
[158:00.33]I'm just, I'm telling you what is probably happening.
[158:03.35]Do not be surprised.
[158:18.51]Uh, this one.
[158:22.01]Hopes are skyrocketing for the food podcast.
[158:32.45]You better call it food mode enabled.
[158:35.86]How one gamer saw his love for food turn into a second hobby.
[158:46.23]By the way, we don't talk about food at all on this podcast.
[158:49.51]At all.
[158:51.11]And when it gets brought up, I get annoyed at the guest.
[158:56.62]Oh my god, that's a lot.
[159:03.25]This actually could be the one, so I'm going to pay attention now.
[159:07.29]Let's put the gamer frying pants on.
[159:27.66]Damage.
[159:42.03]Alright, let me pause it for one second.
[159:43.37]Somebody has an explanation.
[159:44.29]There's a reason American chocolate has that flavor because back in the early days of Hershey's when transporting the milk, it got timed out.
[159:49.69]Nevermind.
[160:01.71]Uh, I'm not doing so well.
[160:17.62]I need more health.
[160:18.52]Yeah, I have to take it.
[160:22.38]And then hopefully you drop an item.
[160:32.49]Come on, come on, come on.
[160:34.01]You did!
[160:37.63]Lightning Strike.
[160:41.14]I like splinters.
[160:43.20]They seem like pretty good.
[160:48.80]I like the area denial.
[161:00.41]Movement speed again.
[161:03.39]You might think that that's not a smart play, but in about one to two minutes, it will be.
[161:22.11]Alright.
[161:24.47]This is the one I want to deposit.
[161:25.51]Good.
[161:31.21]That kind of nerves me a lot right now, though, so I probably won't beat it.
[161:38.43]Who is he talking to?
[161:39.19]My grandmother.
[161:39.73]She's right here.
[161:41.71]You did such a good job at that game, Jeremy.
[161:44.63]Hey, thanks.
[161:45.55]Thanks, Grandma.
[161:48.41]The fuck do you think I was talking to?
[161:58.60]Damn, that's a lot.
[162:08.25]Try to collect as many things as possible.
[162:17.74]Speed or damage?
[162:18.96]Yeah, damage.
[162:25.64]I need more attack speed.
[162:26.56]If I see it, I have to grab it.
[162:27.62]It doesn't matter what the other options are.
[162:36.62]What is that?
[162:37.02]Anybody know what that is?
[162:42.18]100% damage.
[162:50.69]Nice.
[162:51.77]Okay.
[162:54.97]I want the health and the movement speed.
[163:15.09]Whoa!
[163:17.00]There's a lot of shit over here.
[163:18.14]Big damage.
[163:26.38]8% duration.
[163:29.30]Projectiles?
[163:30.04]Yep.
[163:30.24]I think I got most of it.
[163:45.56]Nice.
[163:48.07]More projectiles.
[163:51.39]I got three arrows now.
[163:52.35]That's awesome.
[163:57.61]Jeez.
[163:57.85]Okay.
[163:58.83]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[164:02.46]Damage.
[164:05.32]Where's the boss?
[164:06.52]Here.
[164:39.28]Kill, kill, kill.
[164:45.46]Okay, I don't have any of these.
[164:47.52]When you do not use your main attack for two seconds, your abilities become stronger.
[164:50.35]Alright.
[164:53.13]Plus 0.07% damage for each missing health point.
[164:55.17]Uh.
[164:55.25]So 0.07 times.
[164:55.63]589.
[164:55.65]What is that?
[164:56.13]10% crit.
[164:56.41]That's not very much.
[165:01.75]Like 14% right now.
[165:03.91]I mean, I guess it's OK.
[165:27.25]I'll do it.
[165:27.67]I'll try it.
[165:27.99]I'm doing more damage right now.
[165:33.51]So I shouldn't want to get any more health.
[165:37.11]Oh, that's doing actually a lot.
[165:39.23]That's a lot more than I thought it was going to be.
[165:42.85]Attack speed.
[165:46.10]Where's the boss?
[165:47.18]Oh, I killed it.
[165:47.66]Oops.
[165:51.88]Alright, this actually might be the one as long as I can actually do it.
[165:56.50]Not talk about it.
[165:57.14]Because I am actually mowing down monsters right now.
[166:18.39]Attack speed is really killing me though.
[166:20.65]I need it.
[166:25.22]Damn it.
[166:28.24]That's that's probably just the orb.
[166:43.68]Cheese.
[167:02.83]Two hits to the shields.
[167:03.95]Alright, now I'm going up to pick up this thing and I'm going to collect everything I just... You know what I'm saying?
[167:27.28]Is the carrot only three health?
[167:28.87]What's the point of even picking it up?
[167:44.98]There it is finally.
[168:06.02]It's a five health for max damage.
[168:07.56]Yeah, but five health means I'm dead in one hit.
[168:14.97]If I'm careful, I could probably do it.
[168:16.23]There's one more boss.
[168:19.41]Alright, this is where it gets really, really bad, but I should be fine.
[168:23.79]Just carve a path out.
[168:24.77]That's all it is.
[168:31.36]Forget about any of the items.
[168:32.40]I'll get them all with the magnet.
[168:46.03]OK, shit.
[168:46.69]Alright.
[168:46.97]Alright.
[168:47.43]Alright.
[168:47.69]Alright.
[168:48.13]OK.
[168:48.25]OK.
[168:48.39]Alright.
[168:48.59]I'm dead.
[168:48.99]I'm dead.
[168:49.23]I'm fine.
[169:04.08]Piercing.
[169:13.68]Good.
[169:20.39]Good, good, good, good.
[169:21.21]Come on.
[169:21.51]Just give me it.
[169:22.01]It's right here.
[169:23.38]I'm getting so much health.
[169:26.18]I need this.
[169:26.82]I'll level up like three times if I pick this up.
[169:37.43]Let's go.
[169:40.47]Okay.
[169:42.17]More attack speed.
[169:46.35]Now we walk all the way back down here.
[169:53.61]Damage.
[170:01.12]Damage?
[170:02.16]Yeah.
[170:14.47]Duration?
[170:22.74]I don't know.
[170:24.36]It could be crit damage.
[170:25.58]Alright, this is it.
[170:35.87]Attack speed is a priority if I find it.
[170:40.74]And just try to stay alive.
[170:47.70]Nice.
[170:49.04]Electrified orbs.
[170:50.58]Orbs deal additional lightning damage based on their movement speed.
[170:55.62]What's my movement speed right now?
[170:56.82]I mean, that sounds kind of amazing.
[171:01.97]My movement speed is pretty high.
[171:02.87]Alright, there's another magnet down here.
[171:19.17]Get down there.
[171:38.51]Hmm.
[172:02.78]Jesus.
[172:03.64]Okay.
[172:05.74]50% crit damage.
[172:08.54]I can't go anywhere.
[172:09.94]Don't freak out.
[172:11.22]Don't freak out.
[172:11.90]Just get out of here.
[172:14.68]Just get out.
[172:15.14]Get out of this stupid thing I'm in.
[172:17.13]And then I'm going to heal.
[172:30.59]Nice.
[172:46.54]Attack speed, I need it.
[173:15.30]I'm going to stay over here.
[173:16.36]Because yeah, this is where it gets... There's the boss.
[173:25.15]Play it smart.
[173:35.76]Shit.
[173:40.10]Oh, there's too many.
[173:53.85]Shit.
[173:58.91]Oh, I was so close.
[174:19.08]Damn it.
[174:23.55]Spawning behind me.
[174:24.23]That sucked.
[174:27.28]I got a lot of stuff though.
[174:30.66]Ability.
[174:31.50]Expert.
[174:35.36]Elven slippers.
[174:37.04]Arcane.
[174:38.87]Splitter.
[174:42.25]My next main quest.
[174:43.21]Cool.
[174:50.99]Alright.
[174:51.41]How much does it cost for this?
[174:55.94]okay uh no never mind that's uh that's ludicrous equip the ring yep uh pick up range or attack speed
[175:28.81]I think I need more defense.
[175:31.36]Should I keep watching or should I go shit?
[175:34.28]I'll be back.
[175:35.46]I'll be here when you get back.
[175:38.12]Or maybe you do something else today.
[175:39.30]Attack speed.
[175:45.36]Kind of feels mandatory, doesn't it?
[175:47.96]And the health.
[175:50.20]Do I need a shield for block strength?
[175:51.66]How does that work?
[176:12.18]Can do defense or pick up range.
[176:24.06]Shit.
[176:29.72]No, I want movement speed is so important.
[176:31.96]Let me refund all.
[176:37.40]I got 11,000.
[176:37.72]What do I damage?
[176:43.20]30% more damage.
[176:47.16]18% more attack speed.
[176:51.78]And movement speed.
[176:54.74]And pickup range.
[177:05.72]And I got my items on.
[177:07.94]So what's the next quest?
[177:11.31]I haven't been here in a while.
[177:12.01]What's this place?
[177:12.45]Okay.
[177:13.59]Kill 15,000 enemies in one visit.
[177:18.26]Kill 50,000 imps.
[177:21.42]Defeat the flame dancer.
[177:24.66]Survive the ember grounds until there are 12 minutes left.
[177:26.92]I can do that.
[177:29.68]Kill 1,000 enemies in one visit.
[177:30.94]I can do that right now.
[177:34.78]Yeah.
[177:35.54]Let's do it right now.
[177:37.22]12 minutes, that's it.
[177:39.61]Wait, that's actually kind of a long time.
[177:45.80]We have a stretch break?
[177:46.58]Yeah, it's been like three hours.
[177:48.16]I'm going to go get some water.
[177:51.24]I'll be right back.
[177:59.46]Hey guys, I just stood up to go get some water and there are orcs outside of my room.
[178:07.89]That's the orcs are coming music.
[178:09.57]Be right back.
[182:24.49]How is the fight against all the orcs going in my absence?
[182:39.88]We are losing.
[182:40.78]Uh-oh.
[182:44.52]Let me get in here.
[182:47.24]Hey, let me get in here and get this all sorted out for you.
[182:54.26]Alright, I just have to live until there's 12 minutes left.
[182:58.02]Alright, I got it.
[182:59.58]Look, I'm already doing a ton of damage.
[183:01.76]There's that progression system.
[183:15.61]Speed.
[183:19.63]Speed again if it's there.
[183:20.45]Crits.
[183:32.78]I'm building attack speed first as fast as I can.
[183:36.07]So I don't have to worry about it later.
[183:38.15]Because I kind of got all caught up before.
[183:41.69]Because I didn't have... I wasn't doing enough DPS.
[184:01.40]Alright range.
[184:05.36]Pick up range.
[184:09.62]We're going with a utility build.
[184:12.90]We're going to go with some utility.
[184:23.85]Wow.
[184:26.25]That's great to get right now.
[184:47.63]Sometimes I do block.
[184:50.07]I'm curious how that system works.
[184:52.35]Is it just straight up a percent to block chance?
[185:01.46]Get more defense.
[185:02.20]Read the thing.
[185:17.79]It's kind of good, but damage.
[185:27.38]Don't listen to that person.
[185:28.62]Ban them.
[185:29.14]I don't even know who you're referring to.
[185:30.60]There's a lot of people here.
[185:33.10]Hey, ban that.
[185:34.34]Ban that guy in chat.
[185:35.64]Don't listen to them.
[185:41.50]Imagine being at like a stadium, and I just hear from like row 8, seat number like fucking 400.
[185:50.13]You gotta ban that guy!
[185:53.23]Ban that guy!
[185:54.19]Ban him!
[185:54.77]He's a piece of shit!
[185:56.63]And I'm just looking, I don't, who?
[185:58.37]Who?
[185:59.07]He's like, that guy!
[186:00.05]That guy right there!
[186:00.83]That guy!
[186:01.33]He's pointing, it's like, dude, there's like 600 people where you're pointing.
[186:04.83]I don't know.
[186:05.61]This one?
[186:06.27]This guy here?
[186:06.97]No, you fucking idiot.
[186:09.79]No, you're so stupid.
[186:12.41]You're way off.
[186:24.90]This guy.
[186:25.50]This guy right here?
[186:26.34]No!
[186:31.80]Ban that.
[186:33.04]Ban that guy.
[186:41.28]Am I at the cap?
[186:49.26]Why do I feel like I'm at the attack speed cap?
[186:50.76]It feels like it.
[187:08.50]Is there a cap?
[187:09.70]I don't think there would be.
[187:21.49]Damage again.
[187:28.12]I gotta get this to 200 really quickly.
[187:39.34]More crit chance.
[187:43.14]Crit damage is great, but you actually have to be critting.
[187:47.87]So, let's get that situated first.
[187:52.79]Now we can get it.
[187:53.49]I mean, we.
[187:56.19]Why do you keep saying we?
[187:57.09]I don't know.
[188:14.24]Yep.
[188:18.34]How close am I to... No, not even close.
[188:24.25]Never mind.
[188:30.37]Well's right here.
[188:31.13]He dropped something good.
[188:44.49]these little shell fucking things out of here.
[188:46.73]God, that just took half my health.
[188:47.85]Okay, it's not an item, but it's...
[189:14.86]parchment.
[189:16.24]I'm already almost dead.
[189:19.78]Oh, thank god.
[189:20.40]It's saving us.
[189:20.94]Okay, now slow it down and get some health.
[189:28.23]I can't even get in there.
[189:37.81]That little shit has like a thousand health.
[189:39.43]Alright.
[189:47.04]Uh, splinters.
[189:47.84]Attack speed.
[189:55.20]Am I at a cap?
[189:56.60]I feel like I'm not swinging faster for the last like three times I've done this.
[190:07.36]You are?
[190:07.80]No cap, no cap, no cap.
[190:14.60]Are you sure?
[190:25.35]1.8.
[190:28.00]No cap.
[190:28.58]No cap.
[190:30.46]I guess there is no cap.
[190:32.94]I feel like I haven't seen a 20% increase.
[190:45.33]I'm going to piss people off for that.
[191:06.38]There it is.
[191:06.98]25% critical damage main weapon.
[191:13.26]And then a 10% cone with the main weapon.
[191:17.74]Okay.
[191:32.77]Collect.
[191:44.22]the part that sucks.
[191:52.07]Haven't seen this guy before.
[191:52.91]Oh, no, we have.
[191:59.56]Very briefly.
[192:05.16]Oh, yeah.
[192:05.82]I remember this.
[192:06.64]It is this guy.
[192:10.46]And goodbye.
[192:11.80]I got further than I did before.
[192:12.85]That was hard.
[192:15.71]I did that at least.
[192:17.12]Character Exterminator?
[192:20.38]I unlocked a new character.
[192:26.80]It's the Exterminator.
[192:31.89]Cool.
[192:45.54]It's a ranged character.
[192:49.79]Movement speed.
[192:50.51]Attack speed.
[192:52.89]Yeah, I'll keep it there.
[192:54.93]I'll keep it there.
[192:55.51]This is the worst character.
[192:59.99]Um, let's find out.
[193:04.94]I got one of these done.
[193:11.16]Beat the Lich.
[193:14.67]That's in one run.
[193:17.23]Geez.
[193:21.33]I'm going to try to get to the end.
[193:25.92]Launcher caverns.
[193:32.66]It's a flamethrower guy?
[193:43.58]Ooh, what do we do?
[193:47.58]Attack speed?
[193:49.17]I'm imagining it's probably just spray.
[193:52.13]All attack speed.
[194:01.97]Don't touch that.
[194:04.14]Not yet.
[194:11.26]Seems kind of fun.
[194:14.49]Blog gaming, oh yeah.
[194:18.57]Where are my chocolates?
[194:44.05]The auto attack is funny because it just holds the button down.
[194:48.49]Useful, whatever.
[194:48.99]Getting some kind of shit rolls here.
[194:52.49]Should I turn on auto aim too?
[195:02.39]Yeah.
[195:04.45]Alright, I'm playing with my left hand.
[195:21.07]10% burn chance.
[195:22.01]I guess that's good.
[195:23.09]Attack speed and burn chance.
[195:28.89]This doesn't do very much damage, but I guess it stacks.
[195:37.78]This sounds like shaking a bunch of colored pencils.
[195:41.64]That might even be more accurate than the Lego comment.
[195:43.66]Yeah, it's grabbing a bunch, and I mean at least 30 colored pencils.
[195:50.58]And when you do that, you pick up as many as you can and then like six or seven drop on the ground.
[195:56.39]Yep.
[195:57.15]Oh, I know.
[195:58.39]Speed.
[196:02.51]Follow the blood.
[196:03.23]I was going to say, is that my blood?
[196:07.76]Whose blood is this?
[196:26.01]Uh, what is that?
[196:26.98]Uh-oh.
[196:28.84]100?
[196:28.86]100 what?
[196:31.16]What does that mean?
[196:32.30]100?
[196:33.32]99!
[196:33.66]Why is it counting down?
[196:43.73]Don't leave the area.
[196:44.81]Kill 99 things inside of it.
[196:47.47]But this character... It's probably Lightning Strike.
[196:55.73]Because I don't have to do anything.
[196:56.55]It just does it automatically.
[196:57.65]I'm going to do lightning strike.
[197:02.99]So kill things inside of here, okay?
[197:21.58]That hurt a lot.
[197:24.48]Definitely more range.
[197:38.61]Alright, 3, 2, 1, 0.
[197:41.93]What is that?
[197:44.45]Is that a super item?
[197:49.27]Like a piece of something?
[197:51.55]Okay, I actually want to aim now because it's aiming erratically in random directions.
[198:10.81]Oh shit.
[198:20.47]You know, I have area projectile area.
[198:23.47]Because I think what you need to put on with this guy.
[198:38.62]Alright, all the blood back.
[198:43.95]Hope I don't die.
[198:44.55]Hmm.
[199:08.09]10% is not very much when it's 28.
[199:10.29]Like one or two damages.
[199:28.26]Oh wait, where's the blood?
[199:29.20]I forgot about the blood trail.
[199:30.27]Where'd it go?
[199:44.24]Where's that blood trail?
[199:50.48]There it is.
[199:50.74]Okay.
[199:58.98]Now give me something else.
[200:09.36]I kind of like this character.
[200:10.28]Am I going to keep saying that in another five minutes when I can't hurt anything?
[200:16.57]Probably not.
[200:36.53]I know.
[200:37.01]Yes, safe, safe.
[200:38.59]I'm trying to be safe.
[200:39.31]Safe, Andy.
[200:39.89]That's me.
[200:40.81]I want help.
[200:46.76]I could... That scared me a lot.
[200:50.32]I just did not expect it to be there right there.
[200:54.52]Sorry, I know I'm like kind of chilled out tonight and that was a very loud sound.
[200:58.98]I do apologize.
[201:08.18]It's actually kind of good against bosses, though.
[201:09.60]What do we got?
[201:24.59]Base crit.
[201:26.09]Defense and block.
[201:28.25]Spike Boots.
[201:28.99]When hit, drop 10 spikes to the ground that deal 100 damage and stun the enemy on contact.
[201:33.21]Takes 4 seconds to recharge.
[201:41.50]I mean, just the crit, yeah.
[201:45.50]Those are cool.
[201:47.04]What does it say?
[201:48.56]And so it came to pass that the Countess, who once bathed in rejuvenating blood... I think I have that.
[201:54.39]I have that.
[202:19.95]area I want to deposit the uh I want to deposit the
[202:47.64]item that I got because I'm afraid of my death.
[202:59.64]Will this work with fire?
[203:09.15]It does?
[203:09.45]Ooh.
[203:11.37]Then I want it.
[203:21.04]I'm going to pick this up first because I think I can collect a lot of things.
[203:32.64]What was that?
[203:33.62]10,000.
[203:38.48]I know.
[203:38.70]I didn't forget about the blood.
[203:40.18]I just want to get this because I can level up probably two or three times.
[203:51.37]10% burn chance.
[203:51.93]Yep.
[203:52.45]That's a 20.
[203:52.87]Is that it?
[203:57.70]There's got to be more than that.
[203:59.22]Wow.
[204:00.78]Alright.
[204:16.21]You should stream from a library computer.
[204:26.46]No.
[204:28.92]Range.
[204:29.56]Yeah.
[204:33.05]Nice.
[204:39.83]Oh shit.
[205:04.57]All the bone rattling.
[205:05.64]Yeah, it just kind of sounds like this colored pencils all over the ground.
[205:08.12]They're just a bunch of rats running in circles.
[205:27.51]Does this mean that they'll come out faster?
[205:29.27]I think so.
[205:43.02]Alright, where's this other piece?
[205:54.17]Any more range?
[205:55.39]I've picked it up a couple times.
[205:57.53]About the last few times though.
[205:58.53]Alright, here it comes.
[206:02.36]I gotta kill 90 people in here.
[206:20.78]As long as there's no time limit, that's fine.
[206:30.67]Area.
[206:31.01]Yep.
[206:50.31]Oh, there's so many in there.
[206:51.13]Alright, only one more.
[206:54.04]I got it.
[206:54.34]I got the whole thing.
[206:59.31]So now I go back.
[207:02.21]To that podium.
[207:28.00]Alright, I'm gonna kill this elite.
[207:30.38]Gonna give me a bunch of stuff.
[207:35.84]Fuck, I'm gonna die.
[207:37.94]How many elites are there?
[207:38.70]Oh, just one.
[207:54.97]There's so much bullshit everywhere.
[207:59.33]Uh... I need health.
[208:02.25]Did I actually just lose it right when I picked it up?
[208:04.47]Come on.
[208:06.93]That's a big stinker right there.
[208:08.79]Alright, orbs.
[208:19.24]Some health regen.
[208:20.32]And defense.
[208:47.48]More damage.

[209:06.30]Ah, shit.

[210:18.95]Oh, whatever.
[210:19.31]I guess we'll see it.
[210:20.11]People are calling you the pirate of Twitch because you don't brush your teeth.
[210:34.65]Is that true?
[210:40.17]Yeah, that's why they call me that.
[210:43.13]Ah, my teeth are fucking black and gray.
[210:45.84]I ain't gonna brush me teeth.
[210:50.48]I never have and I never will.
[210:52.62]That's my whole shtick.
[210:54.64]I ain't a guy that doesn't brush his fucking teeth.
[210:57.40]Ever.
[210:59.53]And I look into the camera and I go like... I do that every, like, five minutes.
[211:07.65]No!
[211:08.29]I don't want to die, please.
[211:09.33]I want to at least deposit this thing.
[211:20.15]No!
[211:21.77]Where is it?
[211:23.13]Where is it?
[211:23.77]Somebody said a stupid pirate joke and now I forgot where I am.
[211:29.87]Where is it?
[211:30.23]It's right here.
[211:30.95]I'm just going to kill this fucking guy right now.
[212:00.80]He's going to keep just messing with me.

[213:16.05]OK.
[213:17.11]Fire damage.
[213:21.06]I'm just going to go all in fire damage and damage.
[213:26.82]Now and attack speed.
[213:31.08]In projectile size.
[213:31.94]Can you please say betties?
[213:37.53]Go wide not.
[213:40.35]That's actually true.
[213:47.69]This is wide and a shitload of fire damage.
[213:49.69]I'll try it.
[213:51.11]Here it is.
[213:56.42]I could afford this.
[214:00.62]But... Let's do it again.
[214:02.58]This is fun.
[214:04.10]I like this game.
[214:08.57]Alright, so what do we got?
[214:10.35]I have to kill the lich.
[214:15.13]Kill a bunch of slimes.
[214:23.92]How do you do 750,000 in one run?
[214:32.30]This is not in one run, so I'm going to try to take lightning strike again.
[214:37.66]Stop dying.
[214:42.87]Play for 333 minutes.
[214:43.81]How long has that been?
[214:44.49]Kill 100,000 enemies.
[214:52.89]Rit enemies 50,000 times.
[214:55.83]Deal 10 million damage in total.
[214:57.81]It's almost there.
[215:01.31]Collect 20,000.
[215:02.15]Apply damage effects.
[215:07.34]Kill a total of 10 bosses.
[215:08.68]Almost there.
[215:09.10]Apply debuffs 50,000 times.
[215:19.51]Story.
[215:20.19]Wait, there is a story.
[215:24.47]Reach level 60.
[215:24.93]Oh, it's individual character stuff.
[215:32.58]Destroy objects.
[215:36.52]Alright, reach level 30 with the exterminator.
[215:39.38]And then burn.
[215:45.29]Can chat have a lala?
[215:47.43]In like another 6 or 7 hours.
[215:52.79]I like that each class has their own individual trees to kind of go through.
[216:01.66]Hold on, let me put this up here.
[216:14.49]Did it work?
[216:16.37]It did not.
[216:19.75]No teeth.
[216:20.79]Hold on.
[216:21.69]You guys are linking like pirate faces with me.
[216:32.85]This is just... Okay.
[216:34.29]This is the weird magician one, right?
[216:37.17]Where I was like, I drank the chaos potion.
[216:39.21]This is the chaos potion one.
[216:42.69]But this one's a little bit different.
[216:47.05]Okay, this is I drank the chaos potion.
[216:51.00]but have since kind of learned to be okay with the Chaos Potion enabled.
[217:05.92]Yeah, this is 10 years later after I drank the Chaos Potion.
[217:35.30]That's a good one.
[217:36.60]That's a really good one.
[217:38.64]Somebody said, dude, that looks like a Heroes of Might and Magic portrait.
[217:46.32]Yeah, that's perfect.
[217:53.49]That's an actual good one.
[217:54.69]Yeah, we'll let him hang out down here for a little while.
[218:05.92]Okay.
[218:11.93]Facecam.
[218:12.95]Oh yeah, facecam.
[218:13.77]Look.
[218:14.97]Facecam tonight.
[218:18.11]Alright, so I did burn damage.
[218:19.19]I need to do... I just have to kill... I just have to survive to level 30.
[218:24.21]I should be able to do that.
[218:25.97]Very simply.
[218:33.50]Burn damage is way higher.
[218:37.27]My... The other stuff that I did should be good.
[218:43.29]Alright.
[218:44.16]I'm going attack speed.
[218:47.04]Speed and burn.
[218:48.10]Speed and burn.
[218:48.88]Speed and burn.
[218:50.84]I need to... I don't care about any of the items.
[218:53.16]I'm not doing anything weird.
[218:54.20]I just want to get to level 30 on this character.
[218:58.60]Regen.
[219:00.01]I want to get to like 2 to 3 health a second.
[219:05.71]Jerma nine matey five.
[219:10.46]Nice.
[219:10.78]Hmm.
[219:52.50]Uh, hold on, this... This is the character I'm playing as.
[220:01.05]That's like my portrait.
[220:20.63]I feel like that is going to just start moving around like a full motion video game.
[220:27.94]When I die, that guy over there on the screen is going to just start saying things.
[220:34.45]And then it's going to cut and it's going to be back to the regular place like right there.
[220:39.69]So he's going to be like, oh, almost had me that time.
[220:43.03]And then he's going to just cut back to being static.
[220:52.40]Health regen.
[220:55.18]I'm going for it now.
[220:56.76]I know I should have gotten the other thing, but... Let me try to get to, like, one health a second.
[221:09.89]It'd be so fun to make an FMV game.
[221:13.33]You know, I've thought about that over the years.
[221:15.41]It's just... It'd be so fun to make one of those.
[221:18.71]Like an old shooter.
[221:22.22]get the stunt people make a whole thing over I think it'd be so fun to just like do that speed you officially lost your marbles uh I don't think so I think I'm okay I think I'm doing fine
[221:47.91]Are you still making that video?
[221:49.59]That video was put on hiatus.
[221:53.10]And I just never opened it up.
[221:54.92]So, yes.
[221:56.72]I do still think about it very frequently.
[222:02.67]It is in my brain very frequently.
[222:07.83]One day you will see.
[222:09.09]One day you will see.
[222:16.68]It's not really a big deal.
[222:18.82]I've been talking about this video, but I'm trying to set expectations to zero.
[222:24.94]It's literally one thing I think is funny for about 8 to 10 minutes straight.
[222:31.60]Ooh, this is new.
[222:36.62]Dragon's Breath.
[222:40.85]Damage, yeah.
[222:43.57]What does it do?
[222:47.18]Ah, it just shoots it out like a big wave.
[222:48.54]Sorry, so it's just double fire.
[222:57.99]0.15 additional flame walls and 10% area.
[223:00.83]Yeah.
[223:09.40]Just keep this still as your facecam for the rest of the streams.
[223:21.52]If I actually looked like that, I would probably have facecam on every day.
[223:26.18]And I would just, I would move my face around and be like, it would be, it would be so fun.
[223:31.56]It'd be so fun to have just like a full head of hair and a gigantic beard like that.
[223:37.17]I would make all kinds of face movements.
[223:42.39]I would be unbearable.
[223:45.13]I would be unbearable.
[223:55.65]Do a VTuber thing?
[224:00.06]What happened?
[224:00.74]Yeah, there's lots of things that I've said I wanted to do, but just never did it.
[224:09.83]We talked about the... Yeah, we did.
[224:12.39]I wanted to make a disgusting slime avatar.
[224:17.49]And just have a big cigar hanging out of the mouth and just be awful on stream.
[224:21.05]And start at zero and don't tell anybody.
[224:25.66]And just be fucking awful and toxic and mean and shit to everybody.
[224:36.87]Just, like, talk shit to people in chat.
[224:38.49]Like, if somebody even asks, like, a very basic question, just tell them, like, to fuck off.
[224:42.90]And just, like, make fun of them and stuff.
[224:45.70]This character would be unbearable.
[225:06.25]Alright, if that account gets banned, do I get banned?
[225:09.52]Or can I go, no, it wasn't me.
[225:10.96]It was the goblin.
[225:12.18]It was the goblin.
[225:35.72]Burn damage is doing a lot more.
[225:36.94]50?
[225:36.96]I feel a lot stronger in this one.
[225:57.38]It's definitely going to improve even more.
[226:21.21]Ah, which one?
[226:21.83]Burn chance or additional attacks?
[226:24.57]I feel like burn chance is probably what to do.
[226:33.55]Is multi-hit just best in slot for every character?
[226:35.45]It probably is.
[226:46.20]WM1.
[226:48.42]Sometimes it works.
[226:54.34]I'm going to make my way down to that.
[227:03.52]Level up one more time.
[227:07.66]Always damage.
[227:10.30]Alright, let's get rid of this guy quick.
[227:13.20]Let's try not to get hit once.
[227:26.10]That was clean.
[227:27.00]That was really clean.
[227:27.84]That was very clean.
[227:38.95]That feels very good.
[227:43.31]I think it's this one.
[227:45.13]Plus 10 to base attack damage?
[227:46.61]That just... It's definitely the ring.
[227:55.03]Look at that.
[227:55.91]That's amazing.
[227:59.16]Alright, now don't mess it up.
[228:00.70]Because this could be the one.
[228:02.26]At least to get to level 30.
[228:10.98]What am I missing right now?
[228:12.33]What could I use?
[228:16.33]What could I really need?
[228:17.25]What do I need?
[228:18.55]Besides the scroll.
[228:22.34]More burn?
[228:23.58]More attack speed?
[228:25.16]More movement speed?
[228:27.05]More regen?
[228:38.99]I am very slow, that's true.
[228:45.78]You need a lot more movement speed than this, okay.
[228:50.38]I definitely feel very slow, so... Good idea.
[229:18.49]this fucking pirate picture is so weird yes 10 million damage total what do I get for that
[229:41.45]I kind of look like somebody cosplaying as a pirate that takes it dead seriously.
[229:46.25]And at a convention, you see the guy that looks like this and you're like, holy shit, that guy, this guy, that guy means business.
[229:51.80]That guy means business.
[230:00.32]That's huge.
[230:29.78]You guys are... You guys are fucking crazy.
[230:36.16]Alright, I gotta get this scroll.
[230:45.13]Are there two of them now?
[230:46.43]Wait, why are there two of these?
[230:54.96]No, though, okay, the one, the, that one is, I leveled up five times, and I think I'm the fucking man, even though I'm essentially the same character, I, I'm just, like, level six instead of level one.
[231:08.05]Uh-uh.
[231:16.23]Alright, I gotta, I gotta get back to pay attention.
[231:32.29]This chews through people, especially the ability power.
[231:35.57]I think it's great.
[231:40.55]Health regen.
[231:41.51]Yeah, I need it.
[231:42.58]I want it.
[231:43.56]I can't just do offense only.
[231:44.74]It's the reason why I keep losing.
[231:51.52]Wow, that's so good.
[231:54.04]That was very good.
[231:55.45]Holy shit.
[232:00.77]I just, I actually want to say this, but it is the title, but I just mowed down an entire wave.
[232:23.37]What is this?
[232:31.21]I hate this.
[232:32.79]I hate this.
[232:36.79]Okay, I'm gonna use it.
[232:38.31]What is going on in the world, man?
[232:40.82]What is going on in the world?
[232:41.92]Hold on.
[232:45.74]What is happening in the world?
[232:50.20]We've gone too far.
[233:03.45]How come it's not moving?
[233:08.13]It's not moving.
[233:10.35]This one's supposed to be moving.
[233:18.26]This is a gif.
[233:19.64]I can't get it... Can you make it a video source?
[233:22.12]I don't think so.
[233:25.46]Hold on.
[233:26.20]How come this is not playing as a gif?
[233:29.01]He got... He got closer.
[233:34.52]Yeah, I just leaned in like five feet.
[233:40.45]Save it as a gif.
[233:42.11]Ah, okay.
[233:48.33]It's very weird.
[233:49.10]Okay.
[233:53.94]Okay.
[234:05.13]I have like so many of these saved to my desktop now.
[234:08.31]No, that was a wrong one.
[234:09.86]I didn't want to put that one on.
[234:10.88]Shit.
[234:12.66]Hold on.
[234:24.87]I have so many versions of this now.
[234:27.73]Okay, there it is.
[234:29.43]Did it work?
[234:34.52]No.
[234:37.94]Why not?
[234:42.30]Why not?
[234:55.01]This is a different guy.
[234:57.09]This is not even me.
[235:08.15]I'll leave it for five minutes.
[235:16.27]Ah, movement speed.
[235:17.23]I need it.
[235:30.26]More regen if I can get it.
[235:40.06]Yep, I'm on it.
[235:40.94]Okay, I'm almost at one per second, which is a big deal.
[235:57.74]I think this is the one.
[236:16.43]This is a great, great, great, great, great, great, great start.
[236:32.45]What should I actually get with this character?
[236:34.66]Because I really don't know.
[236:36.34]Orbs?
[236:37.00]I don't know.
[236:37.60]Orbs kind of feel... I don't know.
[236:39.36]I feel like orbs aren't really doing very much.
[236:42.42]This is creeping us out.
[237:04.54]Give me another dragon breath.
[237:12.16]Raid coming in.
[237:14.98]Vinesauce raid.
[237:16.18]Vinny.
[237:17.83]What's up, Vinny?
[237:19.64]Welcome, Raiders.
[237:20.98]Welcome, Ainsauce viewers.
[237:26.52]Oh, and my facecam was just off.
[237:28.06]Let me turn it back on.
[237:32.91]Throwing the beard out a little.
[237:35.89]Thanks for the raid, Vinny.
[237:38.23]Hope you had a good stream.
[237:39.47]I hope you guys had a good time watching.
[237:41.97]We're playing Halls of Torment.
[237:43.83]Game's fucking lit.
[237:47.57]See?
[237:48.72]I can talk.
[237:49.72]I'm with it.
[237:50.88]I'm hip.
[238:02.61]You have to say Austin Powers.
[238:05.39]I'm cool.
[238:05.99]I'm with it.
[238:06.49]I'm hip.
[238:08.57]Hello?
[238:09.57]Hello?
[238:17.23]That one.
[238:23.26]Austin Powers is so good.
[238:25.28]It really is.
[238:25.78]Yeah.
[238:27.00]Alright, so I'm going to turn this off.
[238:32.18]Did not scare.
[238:34.36]All of the Vinesauce viewers.
[238:40.38]This thing is going to be disgusting now.
[238:43.06]Look at that.
[238:43.38]Look at that wave.
[238:45.72]Look at that wave of death.
[238:47.64]Sorry, I got, hold on.
[238:48.99]I got a little, a little overzealous there.
[238:56.03]Which one would you pick?
[238:58.47]I'm not sure which one.
[239:03.87]I'm leaning towards attack speed or defense.
[239:16.84]Any of them?
[239:19.70]I'll just speed.
[239:22.56]Yeah, this is like Vampire Survivors, but it's a little different.
[239:27.00]And I'll tell you, this is very good.
[239:32.08]I've played a lot of the Vampire Survivor likes.
[239:34.21]I think this one is probably... It's definitely, not probably...
[239:42.44]the most fun I've had in a Vampire Survivors like that was not Vampire Survivors I think that with time with a ton of additions because the game's not even in beta yet uh I think it seems pretty good this seems pretty fun it's a good baseline depends on how much they add if you tried bro tato I have I have played bro tato but this to me feels the most like Vampire Survivors the same kind of aesthetic remember what we said I'm all about aesthetic
[240:21.54]It sucks that I have to choose this, but I'm going to.
[240:45.19]Ah, yep.
[240:47.71]Bad.
[240:48.03]I think I'm alright now.
[240:49.73]I don't think I need movement speed anymore.
[240:59.92]Alright, go get the parchment.
[241:07.30]Have you tried a hollow cure?
[241:10.32]I have not.
[241:13.24]I have not.
[241:14.18]I don't know.
[241:14.64]I don't know.
[241:16.42]Is it good?
[241:17.44]Is it like a Vampire Survivors game?
[241:36.38]Oof.
[241:37.34]I got it.
[241:37.70]Level 30.
[241:38.20]Nice.
[241:38.70]Damage with the... Yeah.
[241:40.22]20% more damage.
[241:42.22]Don't get caught up here.
[241:43.18]This is a good one.
[241:44.74]I got a good run going.
[241:57.07]I'm melting these things.
[241:58.15]Remember how horrible these were an hour ago?
[242:00.41]Not even like 40 minutes ago?
[242:01.35]I just did a million fire damage.
[242:13.46]Dragon's Breath knocks back enemies.
[242:15.38]Yep.
[242:23.13]Damage.
[242:39.31]Nice.
[242:40.19]Oh, I'm going to unlock the whole tree for the...
[242:44.62]exterminator whatever his name is crit chance health um have I haven't deposited an item have I
[243:08.58]Take the boots.
[243:10.41]I think I want to take this and deposit this one.
[243:13.25]This thing is just... Yeah, I'll switch the... I want to deposit this.
[243:21.85]Yeah, I'll take the hood and deposit the ring.
[243:35.97]This is where I have to snowball big time, because even though I'm doing a lot of damage and I'm fine, that changes very quickly in four and a half minutes.
[243:49.88]I'm going to go... I'm not going to do the well yet, but I'm going to do the... Might as well.
[244:01.12]I'm going to go grab that magnet because I wonder how far away it is.
[244:07.96]Get crit chance now.
[244:10.20]If it shows up, go.
[244:28.97]Pickup range is a big deal too.
[244:30.30]Yeah.
[244:31.72]I have completely, completely neglected pickup range.
[244:58.62]Ooh, this is like God mode.
[245:07.08]No, it's not.
[245:07.68]Just invincibility, but just take the opportunity to run fast.
[245:18.73]Jeez, that hurt.
[245:22.82]Pick up range or let's just do it.
[245:27.64]I'm safe right now.
[245:30.24]Plus I'm going to level up a ton of times in about 10 seconds.
[245:49.82]Rotato doesn't have a good art style.
[245:52.68]Rotato was very fun.
[245:54.10]Rotato does this thing where they say, hey, do you like this game?
[245:59.38]Oh, you do like this game.
[246:00.30]Well, OK, well, now you're going to play it for a thousand hours because there's like 200 characters and there's seven difficulties.
[246:06.51]Oh, OK.
[246:14.08]And each character needs to beat each difficulty.
[246:17.30]Have fun.
[246:18.73]Oh, okay.
[246:19.11]Well, now I... That's awesome.
[246:21.65]Yeah.
[246:22.47]I played a lot of Rotato.
[246:25.25]On the iPad.
[246:26.21]I know.
[246:26.51]I didn't want to tell you.
[246:45.82]More regen, whatever.
[246:50.59]Offense is not a problem right now.
[247:09.16]Always going to be moving forward.
[247:10.24]That's the... Uh-oh.
[247:15.22]How far away is this thing?
[247:16.44]There it is.
[247:19.54]Mow it down.
[247:20.06]Mow it down.
[247:20.52]Alright.
[247:24.47]Go!
[247:26.69]There's your... crit damage bonus.
[247:42.96]Should I just get more health?
[247:44.08]Yeah.
[247:52.27]Uh, more area.
[247:56.53]Oh, yep.
[247:57.33]Come on.
[247:59.81]Additional flame wall and more area.
[248:07.54]This is maxed out.
[248:09.00]20% more range and more area.
[248:10.16]That's maxed out.
[248:22.66]Movement speed.
[248:38.41]Holy shit.
[248:39.41]Trans... Transfiction?
[248:41.21]Transfiction?
[248:42.79]Fires projectiles in the direction you're facing.
[248:44.51]Damage is reduced for every enemy hit.
[248:47.30]What's that?
[248:54.76]Is this good?
[248:57.70]Damage is reduced for every enemy hit.
[249:00.00]Just get orbs instead.
[249:02.14]Oh, what about lightning?
[249:04.83]It's archer as an ability.
[249:11.63]Do not pick it.
[249:12.51]Pick this.
[249:12.89]Pick lightning, orbs.
[249:16.21]Orbs, I think, is... Lightning is the safest.
[249:18.98]Because I don't have to think about it.
[249:19.94]It just will hit stuff.
[249:33.83]Uh, crit chance.
[249:49.26]There's so much shit everywhere.
[249:54.54]Uh, piercing?
[249:55.92]Does that work?
[249:57.50]For fire?
[250:04.81]I think I'm just going crit.
[250:06.45]Yeah.
[250:14.11]Alright, get it all.
[250:20.08]This pickup range is such dog shit.
[250:32.34]Cool.
[250:41.93]Alright, I'm about to fight the boss.
[250:43.19]I've not killed this yet.
[250:44.51]Oh, wait, wait.
[250:45.09]This actually will be great against these enemies because these things are so annoying.
[250:47.77]They just like kind of cycle on you.
[250:52.46]Oops.
[251:08.68]Oh shit!
[251:09.38]Oh my god, I'm freaking out!
[251:10.34]I'm freaking out!
[251:11.20]I'm alright.
[251:11.48]Everything's fine.
[251:12.10]I'm gonna relax.
[251:33.43]Shit.
[251:33.99]Oh, I'm just... I'm just barely, barely... I'm okay.
[251:37.37]Everything's alright.
[251:41.61]I am taking a lot more damage than I should be though.
[252:07.09]God!
[252:30.53]Well, worst thing that happens is... Alright, bye.
[252:52.81]Holy shit.
[253:13.02]You piece of shit.
[253:15.54]Yes!
[253:30.69]Ooh, elven slippers.
[253:34.27]I gotta deposit something.
[253:38.25]Increases block strength while moving.
[253:39.87]Builds up by moved distance.
[253:41.69]Block strength is limited to 10.
[253:43.92]Movement speed buffs increase the cap.
[253:45.52]Standing still removes... I have to read that like five more times.
[253:52.72]Increases block strength while moving.
[253:56.80]So I can build up to 10 block by moving around.
[254:01.71]If I have movement speed buffs, that goes over 10.
[254:04.77]But if I stop moving, it's all gone.
[254:12.81]Uh, why would I not have to take this?
[254:14.63]4% additional damage for each burning enemy.
[254:22.00]That's unbelievable.
[254:23.08]I hope I don't die instantly after taking this.
[254:25.86]Um, I guess just put it in my backpack.
[254:30.37]Okay, here we go.
[254:37.89]I'm already at the cap.
[254:38.89]No, don't lose it right now.
[254:39.85]Come on.
[254:54.15]Have to go deposit this.
[254:57.10]Wish me luck.
[255:28.74]Shit, okay.
[255:31.67]Uh... Range?
[255:33.93]I'm gonna do range.
[255:47.48]I have to keep that helmet.
[255:48.62]It's imperative.
[255:58.54]Oh, fuck.
[256:09.91]Put it in.
[256:11.21]Okay.
[256:11.87]Alright.
[256:12.11]I'm good.
[256:12.35]I'm good.
[256:14.01]This thing is amazing.
[256:15.11]It's going to kill the run, but it's okay.
[256:19.95]Don't.
[256:20.98]I want to put this up.
[256:21.90]No.
[256:23.14]I want to put this up here.
[256:29.80]How do I put that up there?
[256:32.23]Okay.
[256:45.64]Jeez.
[256:46.18]Alright, this is going to be the end here.
[256:47.36]I just have to keep finding spots to move.
[256:54.94]Five more minutes of this?
[256:55.78]I don't know about that.
[256:56.61]We'll see.
[256:58.87]If there's health, I'm just going to take it.
[257:00.08]I'm going for healing only at this point.
[257:10.37]There we go.
[257:35.09]Oh, this is not good.
[257:52.02]Health?
[257:53.62]Block strength, right?
[257:58.36]Quick, don't think of a pink elephant.
[257:59.90]Why'd you do that?
[258:01.48]Is a magnet right above you?
[258:03.36]Pick up range.
[258:05.54]There is a magnet right here.
[258:06.68]Alright, here we go.
[258:07.44]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[258:15.89]Holy shit.
[258:18.45]Um, even more dragon's breath.
[258:30.03]Oh, uh, I'm dead.
[258:33.23]I'm dead.
[258:38.48]I'm okay.
[258:48.74]There's cheese right here.
[259:23.92]I'll give you a healing potion.
[259:39.46]Yikes.
[259:51.05]Avoid the slimes, they're the worst.
[259:52.65]They turn into like five enemies.
[259:56.70]Huge.
[260:23.24]I thought the pirate image was still up doing the animation.
[260:25.46]I was about to be like, oh shit.
[260:27.26]How do I take that off?
[260:38.69]Healing.
[260:44.87]Jesus!
[260:46.15]There's so many.
[260:49.63]This way, this way.
[260:50.15]There's a gap, there's a gap, there's a gap.
[260:51.45]This way.
[261:47.25]How much time is left?
[261:48.85]Like a minute, right?
[261:49.43]I don't want to look.
[262:13.29]20 seconds.
[262:13.71]Alright, I got it.
[262:14.27]I got it.
[262:14.55]I got it.
[262:14.79]Just don't get cocky.
[262:35.49]Yes!
[262:37.13]Oh shit, it's a real boss!
[262:47.04]Okay, we'll let you do that.
[263:02.17]Oh, this is hard.
[263:03.63]This is hard.
[263:45.85]Man.
[263:49.15]Damn it.
[263:51.79]I took a lot of damage early.
[263:53.19]Just learning the.
[263:55.89]The move set.
[263:57.62]That was the downfall.
[264:02.32]I unlocked a lot of stuff.
[264:05.02]It's a lot.
[264:09.17]Trait stance proficiency.
[264:11.09]Or.
[264:15.95]I got a lot of money.
[264:18.69]Ring of Fire.
[264:22.42]This character's good.
[264:32.30]Tray type... Flammability and Recovery.
[264:37.09]Firewalker Boots.
[264:39.15]Sparking Tips.
[264:43.38]Cleric.
[264:44.78]Ooh.
[264:45.46]New character.
[264:48.34]Unlocks upgrades stream of fire.
[264:53.38]Alright.
[264:54.09]I probably have like five or six grand.
[264:56.07]Ten grand.
[264:57.93]Cleric.
[264:59.47]Cool.
[265:08.61]That's so much money.
[265:10.19]It's so good, but I think...
[265:27.13]What's the cleric?
[265:29.45]Wooden ring is the best.
[265:31.41]It just, yeah, it's just great.
[265:33.91]I'll just get him.
[265:34.87]I want to buy upgrades though.
[265:35.93]I don't want to buy all these items.
[265:43.54]I want the pickup.
[265:44.20]Attack speed's great, but I feel like I'm lacking.
[265:47.92]End of the stream?
[265:48.58]No, I'll play.
[265:48.98]I'll do a couple more.
[265:54.54]It's a chill stream.
[265:55.47]The whole stream is end of the stream voice.
[266:07.18]I think this is good for now.
[266:09.02]I want to do some upgrades.
[266:16.53]OK, what did I unlock?
[266:23.23]Health capacity.
[266:24.37]Did I have that?
[266:26.74]I think I had that before.
[266:36.42]Turn on auto-aim.
[266:37.08]It's efficient.
[266:37.98]I had it on for the end of the boss fight there.
[266:39.94]Just trying to focus on dodging the circles, but got hit too many times.
[266:49.55]I don't know what this character is, so I'm just going to do some basic stuff.
[266:54.35]I think that's... You can't go wrong with damage, and you can't go wrong with attack speed.
[266:59.79]So... I guess that's what we're doing before we figure out what this character does.
[267:12.26]Feeling beachy today?
[267:13.24]Yeah.
[267:26.09]Whoa.
[267:30.15]Okay.
[267:35.49]What kind of damage is that?
[267:54.69]That's a lot of 500.
[267:56.57]Alright, this is if you want to do damage on this.
[268:01.75]And attack speed.
[268:11.26]I'll try the auto-aim.
[268:13.48]For now.
[268:16.68]Should I plug the controller in?
[268:18.28]Let me try it with the controller.
[268:19.16]I'm curious.
[268:21.26]How does it work with controller?
[268:22.87]How fun is it with controller?
[268:23.73]Because I just have auto auto-aim is on and I'm moving my D-pad.
[268:41.61]It's actually recommended.
[268:44.51]Much better.
[268:51.22]I do prefer analog moving around with a character like this.
[268:54.97]Auto and use your thumbstick when you want to clear in front of you.
[268:59.16]Whoa, that's a million times better than what I was just doing for the last five, four and a half hours.
[269:13.26]Well, that's... For those of you that want to be precise, then no.
[269:19.88]But you can be precise.
[269:20.97]I'm holding the analog and I'm aiming.
[269:27.71]Cool.
[269:27.87]Is this on Game Pass?
[269:29.93]Yes.
[269:38.17]Is it like Vampire Survivors?
[269:40.14]I would say it is heavily influenced by Vampire Survivors.
[269:43.28]Heavily.
[269:45.32]But, I will tell you, this is probably my... I'm enjoying this a lot.
[269:54.19]This is... I've played every Vampire Survivors DLC.
[269:59.43]See?
[270:01.26]I feel like I'm starting Vampire Survivors over at zero again, and that's something that you just can't do.
[270:07.55]You can, but I mean, after you have hundreds of hours in Vampire Survivors, I get to start over on a whole new one now.
[270:21.12]That's fun.
[270:34.80]So I can just aim here.
[270:36.48]Wow.
[270:37.78]Okay, that's disgusting.
[270:41.82]I wonder if it's good to do it with this character.
[270:43.54]Let me just see what it does.
[270:45.64]It shoots out.
[270:56.67]It's pretty frequent.
[270:57.59]I thought it was going to be a lot slower than that.
[271:16.35]Clerics cannot crit.
[271:20.87]That's why they are doing so much damage.
[271:25.37]I see.
[271:30.14]But I just did.
[271:30.66]And I just crit.
[271:31.72]I just crit right there.
[271:34.12]Wait, do you mean the move, the actual auto attack that I have?
[271:37.44]Because I have not seen that crit.
[271:40.40]I got one guide.
[271:41.02]I don't, I have not seen my regular attack crit though.
[271:45.97]I think they're correct.
[271:46.69]I think they got it right.
[271:49.23]The abilities can crit, but this cannot, I don't think.
[271:53.52]Technically, they're correct.
[272:01.24]More projectiles.
[272:02.22]Yes.
[272:10.65]You just start with zero crit.
[272:12.35]Okay.
[272:12.61]Okay.
[272:24.87]Base 0%, but it's improvable.
[272:31.69]This is the kind of character I really like to play.
[272:34.69]I like massive damage, but burst.
[272:38.97]I think it's fun.
[272:39.49]20% more damage and more range.
[272:47.02]Yeah.
[272:48.18]Look at that.
[272:57.57]Is it doing less damage?
[272:59.19]Wait.
[273:01.59]It's doing more damage based on the distance.
[273:05.36]Is that correct?
[273:05.86]Am I wrong?
[273:06.60]I'm trying to figure this out.
[273:13.08]Splits between the AOE.
[273:16.21]This is a boss killer.
[273:19.49]It's divide.
[273:20.11]I don't know who's hit.
[273:22.17]That's a boss killer then.
[273:25.75]This is doing 400 damage.
[273:28.76]600 yeah that's crazy so then I should start building crit because then now I have five percent a crit with a thousand damage on a boss would be ridiculous
[274:02.73]area somebody's first time chatter I think I'm I think I'm turning into mush let me help you here let me help you out here get a glass of water drink glass of water sit down
[274:31.75]Stretch for a little bit.
[274:33.84]Stretch both your arms up in the air.
[274:35.64]Stretch up.
[274:37.56]Kind of puff your chest out a little.
[274:40.32]Stand up.
[274:41.22]Kind of move around.
[274:43.96]Let that water really just get into your muscles and into your muscle fibers.
[274:50.67]Make sure you're going outside and you're getting at least five minutes of sunshine a day.
[274:55.69]I don't care what you do out there.
[274:57.43]Just go out there.
[274:58.69]Let the sun hit you in the face.
[275:02.28]For five minutes a day.
[275:06.31]At least.
[275:09.47]If it's really, really hot where you are, the sun is just beaming, put on a little bit of sunscreen.
[275:13.81]Put on a little bit of SPF.
[275:15.03]You'll be alright.
[275:22.16]You gotta turn that vitamin D into... You have to synthesize the vitamin D in your body.
[275:28.41]Let that sun just hit you right in the face for a few minutes.
[275:31.38]Synthesize the vitamin D in your bloodstream.
[275:38.84]But you can take a supplement.
[275:42.17]You cannot, you cannot supplement our mother Earth.
[275:48.85]Well, our sun.
[275:56.08]Is that what he's gonna say?
[275:57.00]Okay, dude.
[275:58.88]Okay, dude.
[276:00.52]Look at how much damage this does.
[276:01.88]A thousand?
[276:04.51]I gotta get him alone.
[276:06.79]Wow.
[276:08.39]Okay, this character is filthy.
[276:16.97]An iron mouse raid.
[276:19.53]What's up?
[276:22.01]Thank you, iron mouse.
[276:23.18]Welcome, everybody.
[276:23.66]Thanks for the raid.
[276:26.21]We're just chilling out, playing some Halls of Torment.
[276:32.73]Thank you, Iron Rose.
[276:35.07]Hope you had a good stream.
[276:37.57]Raid song?
[276:39.32]We did get two raids, but it's... No.
[276:42.86]But, thank you.
[276:43.54]Welcome.
[276:47.84]This game is sick.
[276:49.46]It's very good.
[276:52.21]And I believe, tell me if I'm wrong, I believe the beta comes out tomorrow.
[276:56.61]The beta for this game, I think, is tomorrow.
[276:58.41]They're adding a bunch of stuff tomorrow.
[277:00.37]That's pretty cool.
[277:04.00]Iron Mouse loves it.
[277:05.46]It's great, yeah.
[277:07.84]Iron Mouse, you got great taste.
[277:11.38]It's a win crown, 100%.
[277:21.88]Remind me to deposit this because I'll forget.
[277:31.07]Show your VTuber model.
[277:34.17]Oh.
[277:35.79]You mean this?
[277:37.09]I mean this whole thing.
[277:56.41]This is fucked.
[277:57.19]Stop it.
[277:57.60]Stop it.
[278:02.72]It's allowed to be up there for 10 to 15 seconds.
[278:09.22]It's been way longer than that, but it's okay.
[278:12.16]That's what it looked like in real life, by the way.
[278:18.83]I just wanted everyone to know that.
[278:33.15]Funny, sometimes I'll look in the mirror.
[278:34.32]I've tried to grow a beard before.
[278:35.72]And it's very hard to do.
[278:49.17]More attacks, yep.
[278:59.63]Okay.
[279:01.35]That's all we needed that for.
[279:04.12]OK.
[279:06.40]Any tips on growing a mustache?
[279:07.72]No, my facial hair is like I like the scarecrow.
[279:13.51]It's it's like straw coming out of my face.
[279:15.91]I can't do it.
[279:18.89]It's funny, the last couple of months I've tried, but a month will go by and then we have a string of 110, 115 degree days.
[279:27.19]And I go, I can't, I got to get this off.
[279:30.52]It's driving me crazy.
[279:32.96]And then another month will go by and I'll be like, you know, I'm going to try to grow the beard again.
[279:35.50]And then it's another string of 115 degree days and I'm like, get this off me.
[279:56.14]What's the name of your pirate VTuber model?
[279:58.12]Oh, that's easy!
[279:59.18]Arthur!
[280:02.58]Everybody that came from IronMouse's channel, you can leave now.
[280:05.36]Like, I get it.
[280:08.06]I get it if you're... You know, that was so... I get it.
[280:11.82]Like, if you want to just take off.
[280:13.66]I get it.
[280:15.96]I'm really sorry.
[280:20.72]If you're here, if you're in my community that's here.
[280:23.80]Now you can, you can leave too.
[280:25.06]You can leave too.
[280:25.50]That was, that was, that was a, that was a lever.
[280:27.96]That was a lever.
[280:29.56]You can, that was like, you're hovering over the X. Yeah, it's time to go.
[280:33.05]I got like dinner to eat and shit.
[280:41.65]No, stay, stay, stay, stay, please.
[280:47.07]What was Iron Mouse playing?
[280:48.35]What was Iron Mouse doing?
[281:00.00]That's another one that I really want to.
[281:02.34]I feel like me and Etalyx played that for a day or two or me at every Ster as well.
[281:08.55]I feel like we played that really, really, really early in the early access years ago and just never played it ever again.
[281:30.39]Early adopter abandoning Andy.
[281:33.23]I feel like that happens a lot whenever I play an early access game.
[281:38.05]I play it and I go, oh, whoa, this sounds, this looks so much fun.
[281:41.76]This is cool.
[281:44.30]Oh, it's not going to be done for like four years.
[281:46.64]Oh, okay.
[281:47.00]I guess I'll come back later and then I just don't come back.
[281:52.98]I don't know if that's entirely true because I feel like there's some early access games I really got into and kept playing later.
[282:11.99]Yeah, name 10.
[282:15.40]Coin game?
[282:15.96]Was that game in early access?
[282:19.56]It may not have ever been.
[282:24.64]Oh, that's one.
[282:31.01]Vampire Survivors?
[282:33.67]That was another big one, yeah.
[282:35.17]I played that pretty much all the way through.
[282:38.39]Uh, ULTRAKILL.
[282:42.64]I've played pretty much every ULTRAKILL update.
[282:46.04]Just three.
[282:52.10]I played the Gloomwood demo.
[282:53.72]I didn't play the early access.
[283:01.71]Technically, you went back to Diablo 4.
[283:07.09]Oh, wait.
[283:07.94]Is this a Diablo 4 is in early access joke?
[283:15.04]Oh, I see.
[283:19.62]Let me tell you about Jem.
[283:25.79]You played the beta?
[283:29.93]Yeah, I played the beta.
[283:36.67]Hey, how do you guys feel about Diablo II?
[283:41.83]Crippling cuts.
[283:43.16]Add shots in a backwards direction.
[283:45.16]I mean, I want to see it.
[283:48.26]Plus 166 base damage.
[283:56.79]I'm not sure which one of these is the one to take.
[283:59.11]Probably the fourth one.
[284:08.01]about Dark and Darker yeah but Dark and Darker sits in a weird place right now I'm not sure if that game's ever going to release I mean I don't know the story I kind of caught up on the first part when it was kind of came off Steam and everything which is that's unfortunate because I really did I really liked that game so
[284:30.34]I don't know what the deal is with that, but I... Me and Holly were sitting around talking about it.
[284:35.47]It's like, oh man, Dark and Darker.
[284:37.57]I think this is going to be the game.
[284:39.41]This is going to be the game that I play a lot and I'm going to put a bunch of time into it.
[284:43.77]I love it.
[284:45.11]And it just gets fucking delisted from Steam.
[284:47.21]The one game that I talk about how much like, oh man, I'm super excited about it.
[284:52.14]It's been delisted from Steam and there's like a lawsuit now.
[284:56.22]Oh.
[284:58.46]Well, I was excited about that one.
[285:04.74]I think you just like the dark fantasy setting.
[285:06.64]Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[285:08.92]Dark medieval fantasy is probably my favorite setting.
[285:17.46]Have we decided which one I'm taking?
[285:20.23]It's supposed to still be coming out.
[285:22.67]Well, I hope whatever happens, I hope it gets resolved, and I hope we get to see a cool product.
[285:29.61]But, yeah, we'll see.
[285:31.96]Take one.
[285:32.92]One is more.
[285:34.41]Yeah, that's doom, doom, doom.
[285:48.10]Oh, I was never a big Tarkov fan, but the concept of Tarkov was really interesting.
[285:54.35]That you need to take items with you.
[285:58.11]And if you don't take them with you, they're gone.
[286:00.43]But you do have a stash.
[286:02.66]That, there was a lot of, I don't know, that's cool.
[286:04.84]That's cool that you just kind of, I'm going to put on all my good stuff and really try this time.
[286:08.62]And then you get killed in one hit in the head.
[286:10.62]And you throw your hands up and go, well, congratulations, you just opened up a fucking loot piñata.
[286:16.35]And then we make that person's whole week.
[286:26.33]I never thought I'd hear you talk about Kharkov.
[286:39.03]I just wish, and this is just me being a selfish, selfish person.
[286:47.90]Maybe it's not.
[286:49.82]I just wish they would stop making shooting games and spend more time making games that could work in that world, in that sort of shooter VR kind of world.
[287:03.61]And I just want, I wish we got more stuff that wasn't a shooter.
[287:08.59]Dark and Darker was not a shooter, but it followed the same rules as a lot of those games that are shooters.
[287:18.08]Does it hurt being so correct?
[287:19.44]I don't even know if it's a correct or incorrect thing.
[287:24.29]It's just what I want.
[287:25.79]That's why I said it was selfish.
[287:33.17]That's what I want.
[287:38.30]A lot of shooters have come out that a lot of people play, you know, like Valorant, Apex, Tarkov.
[287:45.53]What's that other one?
[287:46.13]There's another, like, you know, Counter-Strike.
[287:48.81]I don't put Counter-Strike in this category because I think Counter-Strike has been around for so long that it just is, to me, Counter-Strike just is the shooter.
[287:59.27]It's just the shooter.
[288:00.69]It's just the shooter to me.
[288:03.80]Everything else is sort of in a weird kind of cloud above it for me.
[288:11.10]Overwatch?
[288:14.14]Eh.
[288:14.80]It was different, but... I liked Overwatch when it came out.
[288:27.44]The first year or two, I streamed it all the time.
[288:31.20]Some of the people that are new to this channel might not know.
[288:33.14]Back in 2016, 2017, I played Overwatch on stream once a week.
[288:41.38]I played it a lot.
[288:45.40]That was a game I played.
[288:48.66]I enjoyed it.
[288:52.24]It just kind of started to get a little out of hand for me.
[288:58.93]And then Overwatch 2 was just like, I don't really... I don't see a reason to play it.
[289:03.21]I just didn't really... I mean, I played Overwatch... I was just puked.
[289:07.45]Hmm.
[289:13.87]Who's your favorite Overwatch character?
[289:16.63]I really liked Zenyatta and Lúcio.
[289:24.59]I thought they were great.
[289:25.47]He's shit-faced.
[289:26.25]I'm not.
[289:31.35]I liked how they did support in Overwatch.
[289:33.21]It was fun.
[289:33.95]It was.
[289:35.97]Zenyatta was fun to play.
[289:37.95]It was a really fun take on a healer in a shooting game.
[289:43.44]It was really cool putting that orb on people.
[289:48.13]The healing orb.
[289:49.35]It was a really well designed character.
[289:53.11]They made support really fun to play in Overwatch.
[289:56.95]But.
[289:59.67]The rest of the game I was not like a massive huge fan of after the first year or two.
[290:13.08]2016 to 2018 Overwatch was a time to be alive.
[290:15.22]It was fun.
[290:18.30]It was very fun.
[290:22.89]I sort of micro-balanced it to hell.
[290:33.03]I'm not sure if this character is just really good or if I just turned my brain off and started playing very well.
[290:37.96]I think it's probably a combination of both.
[290:50.97]Alright, what do we got?
[290:53.53]Alright, we've not seen this yet.
[290:55.93]Every 15 seconds, you summon a skeleton to fight for you.
[290:58.33]They will perish after a set time, but their life force can be extended.
[291:05.55]Uh-oh.
[291:12.89]Uh... I don't know if I can take this off.
[291:20.36]Is 50% attack speed worse than having a skeleton walk around?
[291:24.77]Oh, wait.
[291:27.01]It's a ring.
[291:27.59]I thought it was a helmet.
[291:29.47]I thought that was a mouth and two eyes.
[291:30.95]It's a ring.
[291:34.47]Okay.
[291:39.27]What should I...
[291:41.52]I'm probably going to say... I just froze for a second.
[291:48.40]This character doesn't do very many crits.
[291:52.25]So let's put this away and put this on.
[291:54.87]Alright, let's see what the skeletons look like.
[292:03.15]One of five skeletons.
[292:04.05]Alright, there he is.
[292:07.56]Remind me to deposit this because... Which one should I deposit?
[292:10.32]Okay.
[292:13.11]Duration?
[292:18.65]The duration abilities and or summonings.
[292:20.43]Ooh, yeah.
[292:23.96]You should put throw wind crown in there for sure.
[292:28.72]But look at how cool this item is.
[292:30.87]You mean I could have five skeletons at the beginning of the game?
[292:33.31]That's kind of fun.
[292:56.56]They're kind of doing work.
[292:58.86]Do they take aggro?
[293:01.53]It's hard to tell, but they're... Dude, that was 90 damage a hit.
[293:06.33]I think these things are pretty good.
[293:16.04]They fight off screen.
[293:19.60]Oh, that's a big deal.
[293:22.38]Look at how huge that is.
[293:28.82]You know what else I think has made me improve?
[293:31.16]The controller.
[293:33.84]WASD versus the two analogs.
[293:36.31]Yeah, this is just much easier to play, I think.
[293:56.13]Wait, is that a skeleton mage?
[293:59.51]That's cool.
[293:59.93]You can spawn those.
[294:12.08]You might as well go skeleton build.
[294:18.68]I've got like 13 minutes left.
[294:20.84]This has been going very well.
[294:28.63]Uh, movement speed.
[294:29.95]Especially if I'm going to fight the last boss again.
[294:31.95]There's no way I'll die in three, four seconds.
[294:38.19]I should have enough damage.
[294:39.21]That'll be what, like two or three thousand a hit?
[294:51.96]Uh-oh, I gotta just power through it.
[294:53.46]Hey dude, your hot pocket is ready.
[295:02.64]That took a while.
[295:05.08]How long has it been?
[295:05.80]Five hours?
[295:06.42]I don't think that it's edible anymore.
[295:09.16]Cool.
[295:31.91]More duration.
[295:33.64]I just max it out.
[295:50.05]Cold in the middle.
[295:52.51]That was always the worst.
[295:55.70]I remember, I haven't had Hot Pockets in a while, a long time, but I do remember you'd get one bite that was burning hot that burnt your mouth, and then the one right after that sometimes would be lukewarm.
[296:20.35]But when you got it perfect.
[296:22.25]When it heated up just right.
[296:24.59]We're talking Goldilocks situation.
[296:26.17]It is perfect.
[296:27.34]Perfect temperature all the way through.
[296:29.34]The meatball hot pocket was my absolute jam.
[296:36.08]I probably lived off of those for a significant period of time.
[296:41.91]I could have if I needed to.
[296:42.93]You know what else I lived off of?
[296:47.57]Corned beef hash out of the can.
[296:52.88]I used to eat that stuff all the time.
[296:54.40]It's like one of my favorite foods.
[297:05.00]Oh shit.
[297:05.56]Alright, give me that.
[297:09.42]Dragon's Breath is really good, but I don't know if it's got all the bonuses.
[297:14.05]You're not supposed to admit that.
[297:17.39]What, that I like corned beef hash?
[297:19.59]The canned corned beef hash?
[297:23.34]Yeah, you cook.
[297:23.82]No, not raw.
[297:25.06]Alright.
[297:27.56]How come every time I say a food I like, you guys assume it is raw out of the box?
[297:33.59]Oh, man.
[297:34.49]You know, I really just love a nice salmon.
[297:37.05]Why are you eating raw salmon?
[297:39.55]What?
[297:42.03]He said out of the can.
[297:43.51]Yeah, corned beef hash out of the can.
[297:46.01]Because you can get corned beef hash from a ton of breakfast places.
[297:49.11]You can make corned beef hash.
[297:50.25]It's just corned beef and potatoes and onions.
[297:53.42]I'm talking about like the Hormel corned beef hash out of the can.
[297:59.20]Not straight out of the can with a spoon.
[298:02.66]Like a... No.
[298:03.62]No.
[298:11.98]You put an over medium egg on top of a serving of corned beef hash.
[298:15.70]Hormel.
[298:17.90]And then you... With Tabasco.
[298:24.15]Get out of here.
[298:25.29]That's like one of the best things to eat.
[298:36.00]That's some real... That's some real good eating.
[298:38.94]That's good eating.
[298:42.22]one fried egg on a nice portion of corned beef hash a couple of duke dupes of tabasco and maybe some you know what let's get freaking how about a couple of heirloom tomatoes on the side from the oven like four or five of them get the scroll alright I'm going
[299:12.03]And a whole roast beef?
[299:13.88]No.
[299:20.36]Get the scroll, dude.
[299:22.06]I'm going.
[299:22.62]I only got 10 minutes.
[299:23.36]I'm going to beat this one.
[299:31.51]Where'd everybody go?
[299:32.15]Oh, that was weird.
[299:47.98]But I do think that D4 is going to be... Alright, I'll stop.
[300:10.79]I am unstoppable.
[300:16.78]damage.
[300:18.97]You've been talking about Diablo for four hours.
[300:22.23]I've talked about Diablo for maybe like 38 minutes total across four hours.
[300:30.33]It's not been four straight hours.
[300:32.20]It's been across, trickled in, over four hours.
[300:38.12]Five minutes here, two minutes there, seven minutes there, six minutes here.
[300:42.88]It's not been the whole time.
[300:47.36]It's been a portion of the time.
[300:53.08]What's the best salad dressing?
[300:56.55]Olive oil.
[300:59.33]Any more questions?
[301:17.13]I was just reading chat and just walked through a whole group of enemies.
[301:19.85]Look at that health regen.
[301:32.00]That's my health going up.
[301:34.99]Why do you talk about food so much?
[301:36.87]I think food is one of the most important things that humanity has ever created.
[301:40.62]I think that food and culture around food I think is probably our greatest achievement as a species.
[301:50.58]People think it's going to the moon.
[301:51.93]People think it's like... No, no.
[301:53.91]It's the guy that made a pizza for the first time.
[302:14.46]The first person that's like, you know what?
[302:15.86]I'm the person that invented baklava.
[302:21.20]That's kind of remarkable.
[302:23.46]Look at what we've created with food.
[302:25.04]Look what we've created with food.
[302:30.41]Welcome to episode two of Food for Thought.
[302:35.01]Me, Grandpio.
[302:39.99]You know, I was thinking the other day.
[302:44.51]Who made... Wait, this is important.
[302:49.10]Firewalker boots?
[302:52.38]While you move, you produce a trail of fire that damages your enemies.
[302:58.58]I have so many items that I want to deposit, but I don't know which one is the cool one.
[303:06.73]This seems incredible to put on the fire character.
[303:15.92]This one is cool.
[303:18.04]This one is just the best one, arguably.
[303:24.15]But this one might be really fun.
[303:34.78]I can't wait until that's your real voice.
[303:37.62]Well, you're going to have to wait about 40 years.
[303:42.25]Is your favorite Trader Joe's item still the chicken tikka masala?
[303:46.01]Yes.
[303:48.93]Butter chicken does fill it in.
[303:51.19]They have this new bowl.
[303:52.39]They have these bowls there that are really good now.
[303:55.59]Have you tried to move something with your mind?
[303:56.93]Let me try the thing on your desk.
[303:58.33]Let me try the matchbox, the box of matches on your desk.
[304:04.17]Let me try to move them right now.
[304:06.70]The red ones.
[304:07.28]Ready?
[304:07.68]Ready?
[304:13.77]Did it work?
[304:22.65]Did somebody just say, holy shit, dude, stop, you moved my house.
[304:30.83]I'm going to move the matchbox on your desk.
[304:34.15]I've ripped your house's foundation off and it just goes into the air.
[304:41.52]I'm going to
[304:44.28]I'm going to take him because it's fun and whatever.
[304:50.73]Seven more minutes and I'm good.
[304:58.49]I'm putting him on.
[305:03.42]OK, so the trail does not last very long.
[305:07.88]But it is cool looking.
[305:16.43]Are you the reason why the Earth rotates on an axis?
[305:20.15]Nah.
[305:23.32]They're okay.
[305:23.68]You should play Psychonauts.
[305:35.00]I was never a fan of just action platform games like that.
[305:39.05]I don't know why.
[305:46.98]Roughness.
[305:51.75]Games like Ratchet and Clank I put in that same category.
[305:54.31]Is it wrong for me to say that I put... Jack and... Jackster, Ratchet and Clank, and Psychonauts is in that category?
[306:03.82]Is that accurate?
[306:05.30]Because that's... As a genre, I don't usually play.
[306:14.35]I'm weird.
[306:15.73]The game I play needs to have weird stakes.
[306:19.99]There has to be stakes with whatever game I'm playing.
[306:22.98]You really break it down.
[306:30.52]To me, Jak and Jak and Dexter does not have stakes.
[306:34.92]It's just like a fun, cool game to play, which is fine, but.
[306:40.68]I want I needed to be steak.
[306:44.52]What are the stakes in House Flipper?
[306:54.79]They're there.
[306:57.63]Because in House Flipper, without cheating...
[307:03.05]You're trying to make money to buy the better houses, to sell, to flip, to get more money, to buy the bigger houses, to flip.
[307:11.19]There are stakes there.
[307:12.15]You need to, like, spend the money.
[307:13.43]You need to make money and spend it.
[307:16.58]There's, like, there's negotiations, yeah?
[307:19.90]What are the stakes in Elden Ring?
[307:22.50]You holding on to souls for too long and losing them?
[307:26.44]That is, like, THE stakes game.
[307:28.02]What are you... Come on, Gwynn.
[307:33.50]Come on Gwen.
[307:33.94]What are you talking about?
[307:35.94]That's a reach.
[307:46.04]How is it?
[307:46.44]OK, wait Elden Ring.
[307:48.34]You tell me Elden Ring does not have stakes.
[307:52.66]Like something you have to put it up, right?
[307:57.10]You got to level up.
[307:57.96]You got to hold on to your souls.
[307:59.31]You got to find items.
[308:01.31]You got to get good.
[308:03.67]You could lose shit if you don't, if you're not careful.
[308:06.65]Where's the next bonfire?
[308:07.89]I don't know.
[308:08.37]Be careful up that cliff.
[308:11.73]And you goofied off the edge, motherfucker.
[308:13.35]What are you doing?
[308:14.53]What have you done?
[308:15.05]Now you lost everything.
[308:27.12]I didn't mean to call you a mother effer, by the way.
[308:30.72]Slipped out.
[308:36.62]You are a cartoon.
[308:38.64]No, I just act like one on TV.
[308:50.33]I'm kind of... This is going pretty well.
[309:02.03]Defense.
[309:04.41]I feel like the defense play is what's going to work here because even if I get hit, it won't kill me.
[309:08.43]See what happened.
[309:15.90]People said you act like one in real life too.
[309:19.74]Oh, I mean, I mess around a lot.
[309:21.92]I mean.
[309:22.18]I think everybody.
[309:27.10]You know, when you're around like your friends and stuff, you kind of just you act like goofy and shit just for fun.
[309:37.75]The magnet.
[309:38.39]Oh.
[309:53.10]Are you comfortable here?
[309:55.28]I think that's
[309:57.09]Why I act the way that I act on stream?
[309:59.73]Because it is just like, I feel fine.
[310:03.05]I feel cool here.
[310:11.84]Well, the well, the well.
[310:12.78]Ooh, but what do I deposit?
[310:20.33]Guys, I just... You can't shut me up.
[310:25.77]I'll talk as long as I'm allowed to.
[310:29.68]Don't ever give me... Have I ever gone to a parent-teacher conference?
[310:34.68]I will just sit up there with the microphone and talk about Diablo II items.
[310:45.64]As the parent or the teacher?
[310:46.98]I mean, just, like, in general, as, like, the parent.
[310:48.66]Like, oh, I'm here to... We're here because the school assemblies, we're going to hear what they're going to be this year.
[310:56.22]And here's the conference where we're going to go over, like, what the students have been doing recently.
[310:59.86]No, I'll... I'll just... I'll fake an illness to not go to that.
[311:15.91]You're going to be dead in a minute.
[311:16.91]Um, I got two minutes.
[311:21.94]Whose dad is this?
[311:25.96]Yeah, we're really excited for the next season of the school baseball team.
[311:31.92]I really was curious.
[311:33.14]This year, are we going to be able to have... Are the gloves going to be provided or are we going to have to get that as parents?
[311:40.91]Hey, by the way, gloves.
[311:42.05]Speaking of gloves.
[311:43.65]I think that you should be able to put charge bolt on something besides gloves.
[311:47.95]I think you should be able to put them on, let's say for instance, cleats.
[311:52.56]Boots.
[311:53.46]I think that would be... That would be interesting, I think.
[311:58.44]Where's my kid?
[312:01.74]Your kid's not here.
[312:02.76]This is the parent-teacher conference.
[312:04.78]Oh, right.
[312:06.39]Anyways, Diablo 4 is not good.
[312:09.19]Diablo II is the real game.
[312:11.31]And then you hear somebody starts clapping.
[312:13.39]Because one person cares about this.
[312:25.91]The well.
[312:26.71]Oh shit, the well.
[312:28.01]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[312:29.06]I'm good.
[312:29.38]I'm good.
[312:30.52]I'm Jerma.
[312:31.28]I'm a cartoon character, remember?
[312:32.64]Oh shit.
[312:51.33]Oh shit.
[312:52.13]What am I depositing?
[313:04.16]Probably the I don't know if the booth seems not that great.
[313:08.74]Well, that was exactly what I wanted to get badly.
[313:11.66]How far away is this?
[313:17.34]I'm not gonna be able to get there.
[313:29.85]Oh shit, I'm in trouble.
[313:43.13]OK, what am I putting in?
[313:47.85]Windcrown is just useful for a ton of people.
[313:51.30]It just is.
[313:54.88]This is really fun, but this is useful.
[314:24.71]is the one.
[314:51.00]Those defense points really did come in handy.
[315:23.86]Damn!
[315:24.28]Alright, I gotta... Uh-oh.
[316:00.56]That's not what I wanted to do.
[316:47.50]What is he doing?
[316:49.36]Why is he being so weird?
[316:50.19]What's he doing?
[316:55.19]He's like trying to grab, he's trying to grab me.
[317:02.43]I got it.
[317:04.87]Collect a total of 20,000 gold.
[317:05.77]Congratulations, you survived the halls of torment.
[317:08.90]And I picked up something.
[317:13.86]Cool.
[317:22.87]So what did I get?
[317:23.57]Ability Radiant.
[317:27.15]Aura.
[317:29.05]Money, money.
[317:29.67]Effectivity and Accuracy.
[317:35.82]Money.
[317:38.14]Painful Incision Upgrade.
[317:42.34]Money.
[317:43.84]False Blessing trait.
[317:47.69]Money.
[317:49.49]Revives.
[317:51.69]That's a great thing to unlock.
[317:53.57]Money.
[317:56.21]Gold gets brewed in barrels.
[317:59.43]And then there's the Wraith Warlord.
[318:01.29]Ten grand.
[318:09.55]Well, this character is amazing.
[318:11.67]Hold on.
[318:12.89]Let me see.
[318:16.00]Revives, yeah.
[318:16.86]Five grand.
[318:22.63]Cool.
[318:28.81]These are all very expensive.
[318:34.49]Did I unlock a new zone?
[318:35.73]I did not.
[318:39.05]Alright, there's a boss here too.
[318:41.57]But I don't know if I'm going to get there today.
[318:47.02]Actually buy the wind crown?
[318:48.38]Yeah.
[318:48.54]Yeah.
[318:53.27]Do I buy the Windcrown or do I buy this and have the fire character be very good?
[319:08.35]This is good for everybody, though.
[319:13.96]Yeah, everybody can use that.
[319:15.08]There's only one character that really can use this.
[319:29.17]500,000 damage with a lightning strike.
[319:30.89]500,000 damage in one go.
[319:33.65]That's a lot of unlockables.
[319:39.85]I like this game.
[319:42.25]Reach level 100.
[319:42.63]I feel like you have to have pretty much everything unlocked.
[319:48.64]We could probably call it here too.
[319:49.84]It's been like five and a half hours.
[319:50.90]I think that's a good place to stop.
[319:55.78]This is great.
[319:56.96]The beta is tomorrow, I think.
[319:59.32]And they're adding a bunch of stuff.
[320:01.97]So maybe I'll do another killout stream in the next couple days.
[320:06.79]I do want to open some TF2 crates, too.
[320:17.18]Probably maybe Wednesday this week.
[320:19.40]Middle of the week.
[320:21.35]Wednesday around, probably around the same time, like 5 or 6.
[320:24.11]Keep it at 6 Pacific because I can always pull it back like 30, 40 minutes if I need to on Wednesday.
[320:31.73]Might play some more of this.
[320:32.66]Might play a little TF2.
[320:34.50]Open up some TF2 boxes.
[320:43.38]See you on Sunday?
[320:45.35]No, no.
[320:46.07]I'll be live on Wednesday.
[320:46.91]I'll see you Wednesday.
[320:54.30]More Team Fortress.
[320:55.66]Wednesday.
[320:56.18]6 p.m.
[320:58.02]Pacific.
[321:01.12]D2 Remastered.
[321:04.51]If I play D2 Remastered and I start a new character and you guys pick the build, that's actually going to end up being a like 7 to 8 o'clock Pacific.
[321:16.17]We just turn it down and just hang out and just play.
[321:27.94]Show off your characters.
[321:32.86]We'll look at this.
[321:35.10]Exterminator.
[321:36.24]Swordsman.
[321:37.40]Archer.
[321:39.38]What about Yakuza?
[321:46.69]I want to get my fill of this, especially if they're going to update it tomorrow.
[321:50.65]So we'll probably... This sounds so outrageous to say.
[321:57.45]But I'm gonna say it.
[321:59.45]We're gonna open TF2 boxes for like a half an hour.
[322:04.30]I might play like a round or two.
[322:06.06]Maybe I'll hang out and play some TF2 for like an hour.
[322:08.88]And then I'm gonna play this.
[322:10.86]So I'm gonna open up boxes for the first part of the stream.
[322:13.19]That feels odd to say.
[322:15.77]That sounds outrageous.
[322:25.52]Not too many.
[322:26.74]I just have a ton of crates and cases over the last 10 years that I never opened.
[322:32.80]And I just kind of want to open them.
[322:35.12]I've given my TF2 backpack away like three or four times.
[322:38.40]So, maybe I'll get something cool.
[322:46.08]Probably like 20 boxes.
[322:48.11]Maybe like 15 to 25.
[322:50.61]I don't want to go overboard.
[322:53.55]But just enough to, you know...
[322:55.58]Have a little bit of fun.
[322:58.40]100?
[322:59.08]No.
[323:03.76]250.
[323:03.98]I don't even know if I have 50 boxes to open.
[323:09.64]I think I have like 30 or 40.
[323:12.18]And I don't think I want to open some of them.
[323:13.56]Some of them are some old crates that I don't even know what's really in them.
[323:19.96]Alright, is series 90, 91, and 92 crates any good?
[323:25.10]I have a lot of 89, 90, and 91.
[323:26.86]Are those any good?
[323:30.91]No.
[323:38.79]Don't open crates, open cases.
[323:42.74]There are no good TF2 crates.
[323:44.42]Not anymore, really.
[323:48.98]You once said that you would rather have every hair on your body removed with tweezers rather than open crates on stream.
[323:56.04]I did?
[323:56.50]No.
[323:59.25]I said that?
[324:05.03]That's not... How long ago?
[324:07.75]How long ago, though?
[324:09.51]Was it more than five years?
[324:12.66]Was it like ten years ago?
[324:16.02]Link the clip.
[324:20.28]I've been doing this for too long.
[324:22.08]You guys just have every piece of audio I've said for 13 years, you just have it.
[324:28.15]I don't remember what I said 11 years ago.
[324:31.68]Alright, so 10 years ago I said I would remove every hair on my body with tweezers.
[324:36.04]If I did it.
[324:37.04]Or, whatever.
[324:41.45]You said it an hour ago.
[324:43.25]I don't remember you saying that.
[324:44.55]You can't seriously expect my client to perjure himself over a conversation from 12 years ago.
[324:52.39]That's right.
[324:57.52]Do it now or we unfollow.
[324:59.40]I'm doing it on Wednesday.
[325:00.58]Hey, relax.
[325:06.77]It was on the streamer simulator stream from about two years ago.
[325:14.97]well hey things have changed I've changed right things have changed a little I've changed I'm willing to open up 15 to 20 crates in Team Fortress without removing all of the hair on my body he's changed it's been two years has it really only been two years
[325:44.90]Yeah, I, okay.
[325:46.48]Post 35, I can't be like, ah, you know, I was, I was like 20s.
[325:53.32]I said that, and I didn't, that was literally like, I was, I was over 35 when I said that.
[325:58.88]So.
[326:02.12]But we're still doing it, so.
[326:08.13]You've massively mellowed out.
[326:11.65]I think that's just kind of natural, though.
[326:16.31]I told you guys this at the beginning of the year.
[326:19.59]I mean, I've gotten... When I started doing YouTube videos, I was 25, 26.
[326:24.42]That's when I started.
[326:29.04]That's like the Team Fortress 2 YouTube videos.
[326:35.78]I've gone through my 20s into my late 30s.
[326:41.15]It's just natural.
[326:41.93]You're just going through the natural order of
[326:47.03]You know, dialing it back a little.
[326:50.25]That doesn't mean I still can't have a bunch of fun.
[326:54.11]I can still move.
[326:55.61]How about that one?
[326:56.85]Ow, my arm.
[326:57.43]Uh-oh.
[327:01.01]Oh, boy.
[327:02.09]That's a... That's a blown-out elbow.
[327:06.43]That's a blown-out elbow.
[327:09.97]Yeah.
[327:14.98]But yeah, I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[327:16.28]Thanks for watching.
[327:16.96]Thanks for hanging out.
[327:24.66]You should have played a loud bone cracking sound.
[327:41.31]Do it again.
[327:43.46]What about the la la la la?
[327:44.66]There you go.
[327:48.02]I'm not doing that ever again.
[327:49.50]Unless somebody says it as a one guy and I read it.
[327:53.36]And I do it immediately following reading it.
[327:56.45]So I'm never doing that again.
[328:05.13]But yeah, this is fun.
[328:06.31]I like... Kind of adding to that.
[328:12.30]It is nice to just kind of relax a little bit.
[328:15.92]I know a lot of people are really used to this channel being kind of like crazy, but I think it really is for the best to do more of this.
[328:26.21]I definitely don't want to just only have it be just wacky, crazy shit.
[328:33.08]That's very unsustainable.
[328:36.26]You want me to be completely realistic?
[328:43.10]This one was still kind of wacky.
[328:44.36]It can be wacky, but dialed down a few notches.
[328:49.20]You know what I mean?
[328:49.62]Do you prefer this or Vampire Survivors?
[328:57.81]They're both very, very good.
[329:00.93]Vampire Survivors has way more content.
[329:06.41]You like the chill streams?
[329:09.91]I do too.
[329:10.45]I like them both.
[329:16.99]can eat pizza but then you can also eat steak and cheese sandwiches too they both exist what's something that's too wacky um I don't know this is the vibes when the vibes are wacky it's fun but
[329:39.22]It's also nice to kind of just not do that.
[329:42.75]Just relax and chill and play games and just talk about stuff.
[329:46.11]It's the vibes of the BatChest.
[329:47.35]Exactly.
[329:47.83]You know exactly what I'm talking about.
[329:56.47]Thank you for watching.
[329:57.35]See you all on Wednesday.
[329:58.41]Thanks a lot.
[329:59.49]Take care of yourselves.
[330:01.61]It's probably pretty late, except when you guys get some rest, drink some water, call your mother.
[330:05.99]You know.
[330:07.37]You know the deal.
[330:13.95]See you later.
[330:15.71]Take care.
[330:18.95]It's 4 p.m.
[330:19.75]Oh yeah, these late night streams.
[330:21.44]There's a lot of people from the other side of the world that watch.
[330:46.64]Australia?
[330:47.12]Yeah.
[330:49.02]Senior citizen.
[330:59.05]It's 2034 here.
[330:59.56]Why are you still alive?
[331:02.14]Well, you're in a time machine.
[331:03.04]Alright, see you Wednesday.
