[00:00.61]Does it work?
[00:01.93]You guys see the stream.
[00:06.33]What happened?
[00:10.99]25 million late yes.
[00:14.14]What?
[00:15.86]I was?
[00:16.78]Oh.
[00:18.64]I was testing the stream.
[00:24.68]Look, if you lose by 7 seconds, you still lost.
[00:28.18]If you lost by 4 seconds, you still lose.
[00:31.97]I hate to tell you that, but that's... Hey, look, if you get... If you get blackjack at the table and the dealer gets blackjack too, I'm sorry.
[00:41.48]You didn't win.
[00:42.00]I know it feels kind of horrible.
[00:51.70]I trusted you.
[00:54.32]Double blackjack?
[00:58.29]I did not do that on purpose.
[00:59.57]I really didn't.
[01:01.50]Hello everybody, how are you?
[01:02.80]Let me just make a tweet.
[01:05.14]Today we are going to play a video game.
[01:07.71]I know that yesterday we had some problems.
[01:12.56]uh it has been essentially confirmed for me even though nobody confirmed it I confirmed it myself with just how I feel about the situation uh I apparently there was something wrong with where the traffic was coming from for some streamers to the Twitch ingest servers I know I wasn't the only one I remember ludwig was talking about it we uh we both had the problem yesterday so it's working now there's not a problem now
[01:38.80]So, we got the free space.
[01:41.14]Why are you playing bingo?
[01:42.09]I'm playing Pikmin today.
[01:43.21]This is not a bingo stream.
[01:49.99]But yeah, I got Pikmin 2s ready to go.
[01:52.19]I have the Wii version.
[01:53.09]I don't know if that's a bad thing or not.
[01:54.35]People are probably going to be really pissed off that I have the Wii version, not the GameCube version, but that's the way it is.
[02:01.00]It's been upscaled from 480p to like 520p.
[02:07.49]Those extra 40 resolution pixels are worth it for me, okay?
[02:14.87]Let me just... Let me grab my drink.
[02:16.13]I'll be right back.
[02:16.73]Just a second.
[03:34.51]So, also, I made a mistake here.
[03:38.15]I was brewing a tea.
[03:40.47]What's going on with my mic here?
[03:41.42]Come on.
[03:41.80]Get up here.
[03:43.50]Why is my mic stand is fucked up?
[03:46.64]What the fuck?
[03:50.34]So, I brewed a tea.
[03:52.51]And the tea bags... I had black tea and a green tea.
[03:56.50]They were right next to each other.
[03:58.66]And I didn't know which one was which.
[04:00.48]I wanted black tea, and I, like, I was, like, just kind of rushing to kind of get this thing started.
[04:04.91]And I didn't know which one was the black tea.
[04:07.99]I kind of, like, switched them around too much.
[04:09.57]So I just put them both in and didn't even care and just brewed it.
[04:12.54]So I don't know if that's a problem.
[04:14.50]Is, like, mixing black and green tea, like, a bad thing?
[04:21.11]I wasn't going to wait like the two or three minutes to ruin the water.
[04:26.23]Because if I put the green one in.
[04:28.94]Oh, shit.
[04:29.88]It's the green one.
[04:30.72]I wanted black tea.
[04:31.86]No, I don't want the green tea.
[04:33.38]I would have to like, okay, I guess I'm going to drink green tea.
[04:35.52]Oh, what?
[04:35.72]You redo it?
[04:36.24]You re-boil the water?
[04:37.82]No.
[04:39.80]So I just put them both in.
[04:40.74]And it's like a weird mix of black and green.
[04:43.98]I don't know.
[04:44.26]I'm mixing like different tea drugs.
[04:47.20]But we don't have to... I didn't even tweet this.
[04:49.38]What the...
[04:52.21]That's the whole point.
[04:52.93]I went and got my phone.
[04:54.26]Alright, what should I title this?
[05:00.60]How about just Pikmin 2?
[05:03.26]Is fucking fun as hell.
[05:06.94]Pikmin 2.
[05:09.75]Let's go, guys.
[05:13.01]No, I'm not doing that.
[05:17.17]This tea tastes bad.
[05:19.23]But I don't even care.
[05:20.01]I want it.
[05:23.15]I knew this is going to happen too.
[05:24.22]This is going to cause some frustrations for me.
[05:25.82]I knew it.
[05:26.20]I'm hunching over because my mic is fucked.
[05:27.76]Hold on.
[05:30.52]And also I'm like stalling right now because I'm terrified that I'm going to get like Twitch.
[05:35.38]The servers are going to fuck up again.
[05:37.14]So pardon my paranoia right now while I wait to make sure this is going to be green for an extended period.
[05:46.35]It's two T's.
[05:47.13]Yeah.
[05:47.27]Alright.
[05:47.51]I'm going to mute because it's
[05:56.02]Okay.
[05:57.43]Are you ready?
[05:58.69]Are we ready for Pikmin 2?
[06:01.25]I have not... I've only played like maybe an hour of all this entire series.
[06:04.65]So I don't know if it's any good or not.
[06:14.75]I need to adjust this.
[06:15.73]Hold on.
[06:18.79]Pikmin 2.
[06:20.13]Wow, that really is like kind of 1080, isn't it?
[06:25.20]That is 1080.
[06:25.50]Kind of.
[06:26.52]I mean, I'll fix it.
[06:38.73]It's 7-what?
[06:39.99]It's 7-something.
[06:40.67]I'm probably gonna make somebody sick by doing this, but I want to get this right.
[06:49.83]Oh, don't go to the black screen?
[06:50.97]No!
[06:51.23]Oh, that actually... Yeah, dude, that's perfect.
[06:59.25]Almost there.
[06:59.61]Almost got it.
[07:00.85]Almost got it.
[07:01.45]Almost got it.
[07:02.45]Got it.
[07:02.77]Done.
[07:03.85]Alright, Pikmin 2.
[07:05.09]I don't care about the cutscene.
[07:06.01]I don't know anything about Pikmin 1.
[07:08.05]It's a guy that pulls flower people out of the ground and throws them and stuff.
[07:12.07]I don't need that much of an explanation for it.
[07:14.91]I can't imagine the story is that intricate.
[07:18.68]Is it?
[07:23.94]Is the story that big of a deal?
[07:26.26]LOL, this game is shit.
[07:30.14]You're about to get attacked, and look, what am I supposed to do?
[07:33.00]I'm looking from, like, the rafters of the base.
[07:35.56]Looking down at you, running around with, like, a pickaxe or something.
[07:40.07]And there's, like, 200 people with, like, machine guns around you.
[07:42.69]And you're running around like, let me in!
[07:44.29]Hey, let me in the base!
[07:45.61]Pikmin 2 sucks!
[07:47.41]And I'm just looking down like, dude, I'm sorry.
[07:49.21]You're dead.
[07:49.59]There's nothing I can do for you.
[07:51.15]You're surrounded.
[07:53.82]Just, like, you're dead.
[07:55.94]I'm sorry.
[07:58.90]And then you like throw the pickaxe up at me like I'm the problem.
[08:04.31]Like, oh, fuck you, buddy.
[08:05.65]It's like, no, I didn't.
[08:06.47]You just did that and you pissed off like a thousand people.
[08:09.93]And by the way, you hit like the middle of the castle.
[08:12.92]You're not strong enough to throw that high.
[08:15.12]Now you don't have a pickaxe.
[08:15.92]Now you're fucked.
[08:19.32]I'm going to test this too.
[08:20.72]He's stalling.
[08:21.52]I'm just making sure it's green for 10 minutes, please.
[08:25.06]I'm so paranoid.
[08:26.02]I'm paranoid.
[08:32.29]I'm going to put a facecam on for this.
[08:37.83]Oh, you're not getting a facecam.
[08:38.83]Alright.
[08:40.51]I need to test the audio and that is a real thing.
[08:43.13]That's not a stalling thing.
[08:44.05]You ready?
[08:47.03]One, two.
[08:49.12]One, two, three.
[08:51.26]One, two.
[08:53.32]Let's go Pikmin.
[08:55.00]Good.
[08:57.34]Sounds pretty good, right?
[09:03.34]Good.
[09:04.74]Alright, let's go.
[09:06.28]Pikmin 2.
[09:06.60]Does this have motion controls?
[09:11.34]Begin.
[09:13.74]Great Pikmin 2 save data.
[09:15.04]Yes.
[09:17.83]we want to see your face uh no I'm not doing it I'm not putting my facecam on it's not happening this is a pre-recorded thing no it's not I think we're green though I'm fine uh new ships log sure are there upgrades in this game
[09:39.36]Okotate Freight is a long-haul deep space shipping company.
[09:44.00]One day, its only employee of any merit, Captain Olimar, has the entire first game.
[09:48.62]Got hit by an asteroid and crashed into Earth while on interstellar vacation.
[09:53.74]There, he was aided by indigenous creatures, which he called Pikmin.
[09:58.18]In the end, Captain Olimar escaped.
[10:00.84]Good.
[10:01.32]Don't need to play the first game now.
[10:03.86]But in Olimar's absence, his employer, Okotate Freight, ran into financial difficulties.
[10:12.44]Oh, it was way too hot.
[10:19.61]Dead.
[10:21.37]There's Captain Olimar.
[10:26.17]And by the way, people that say Olimar, we don't listen to those people.
[10:38.43]President of Hokotate Freight and local employee Louie.
[10:42.76]Oh, this is a spoiler.
[10:43.44]I knew he was in the game because I played Smash Brothers.
[10:51.00]Olimar, I'm so glad you're safe.
[10:52.60]Yes, very glad.
[10:53.52]Quite glad.
[10:54.26]But... Sadly, I have an announcement that is not so glad.
[10:59.28]Our company is going under.
[11:00.59]Yes, we're finished.
[11:02.75]On his first mission, Louie here met a ravenous space bunny.
[11:05.57]His entire load of golden Pik-Pik brand carrots was eaten.
[11:15.92]I took out an enormous loan to repay the debt from this loss.
[11:20.11]I decided to sell assets to repay... I fucking forgot about something.
[11:23.25]Be right back.
[11:53.65]We're good.
[12:14.62]We're good.
[12:14.96]We're good.
[12:15.30]We're good.
[12:15.60]We're good.
[12:17.04]We're good.
[12:17.88]I just want to make sure the water boiler was off.
[12:23.31]I was like, water boiler.
[12:24.23]Wait, is that on?
[12:25.81]Oh, fuck.
[12:28.42]It's off.
[12:28.76]We're good.
[12:29.14]It was off.
[12:29.90]Making sure.
[12:32.62]Missed the story.
[12:40.30]With Captain Olimar.
[12:43.99]You two will save the galaxy.
[12:45.61]Let me restart it.
[12:55.70]Okay, I know they're like, he's probably his like cousin or something.
[13:05.99]It's like, what is this, his little brother?
[13:15.29]Valley of, okay.
[13:17.59]We have to repay the debt together as brothers.
[13:23.58]Nintendo loves having like Super Mario and Super Luigi.
[13:26.34]I get it.
[13:26.68]That's a lot uglier than I thought it was going to be.
[13:44.31]That was close.
[13:45.79]I have averted a crash landing.
[13:48.87]Running diagnostics.
[13:52.98]Alert.
[13:53.67]Danger.
[13:54.25]Louie is missing.
[13:55.49]He must have somehow fallen out of his cockpit.
[14:00.01]He hates the game already.
[14:01.03]No, he don't.
[14:03.01]He's not responding via his communicator.
[14:05.90]He is either flouting protocol or in danger.
[14:11.58]Oliver!
[14:12.32]Fuck!
[14:13.02]You must find Louie before he freezes to death in the cold of this planet.
[14:19.93]Wait a moment.
[14:20.55]Look.
[14:26.59]It's a Bunger Burger and Pikmin!
[14:29.03]Could these be Pikmin?
[14:30.51]They look like they're about to be devoured as we speak.
[14:37.39]You must help them.
[14:38.37]Point at the screen and press B to call them with your whistle.
[14:42.18]Oh, no.
[14:42.82]It uses the Wii pointer.
[14:46.02]Oh, God.
[14:46.54]I already hate it.
[14:48.60]I already hate the game.
[14:50.64]Okay.
[14:53.61]You can also hold B to make the sound of your whistle carry farther.
[14:56.81]Remember?
[14:57.75]Nope.
[15:00.31]Alright, let's see what happens.
[15:01.09]Alright, where's my... I point... Oh, shit.
[15:05.80]Okay.
[15:11.40]This game blows.
[15:12.42]No, it's... Stop!
[15:13.80]We haven't even gotten five minutes in.
[15:15.18]This is, like, everyone's favorite game in this channel.
[15:20.11]And I gotta lean back to this one.
[15:21.15]I'm sitting back, hold on.
[15:22.11]Shit, okay.
[15:43.52]Hold A, grab Pikmin, then point at the screen and release to throw it.
[15:48.05]Cool.
[15:49.17]Actually, I might actually like this.
[15:50.69]We'll see.
[15:52.19]So, hold a Pikmin.
[15:58.15]Um, actually, it's actually pretty good.
[16:00.15]It's not bad.
[16:02.11]That could be a lot worse.
[16:05.47]I'm gonna need, like, a wrist helper, though.
[16:07.77]Hold on.
[16:12.03]Yeah, I'm going to have to rest my wrist and just sit here.
[16:19.93]Attention, Captain Oliver.
[16:21.05]I have just reestablished my communications link with Louie.
[16:26.47]It is fortunate we have managed to confirm his safety.
[16:29.45]Press minus to communicate with him.
[16:31.47]Cool.
[16:33.57]Do the fucking bingo.
[16:34.69]Well, I'm going to do bingo of my own stream.
[16:43.49]If I look at the bingo, don't I not want to do those things?
[16:47.27]You're going to have to update me later.
[16:52.49]I'm quite interested in the details of his condition.
[16:55.59]I'm not going to look at it.
[16:56.55]Why would I do that?
[16:58.74]No, don't have any fun.
[16:59.70]Okay, so let's talk to Louis.
[17:05.72]Louis.
[17:08.78]It's Vin Diesel.
[17:11.20]And introducing Vin Diesel as Louis.
[17:14.78]Louie, allow me to assess your condition.
[17:18.14]As per our safety protocols, are you at all injured?
[17:20.70]Is that so?
[17:24.58]Then my concerns are eased.
[17:25.92]Our communication link shows you are nearby.
[17:28.00]Okay, cool.
[17:28.44]When you make your way to our location and rejoin us, I will navigate for you.
[17:36.85]Press plus sign to contact me and obtain information about the terrain.
[17:45.45]Okay, so Louie doesn't have any Pikmin.
[17:48.83]Louie has no Pikmin.
[17:50.85]So I just run her up through the... Oh, okay.
[17:54.31]Yeah, we are nearby.
[17:55.37]Thank God there's a map in the game.
[17:56.51]I'm so happy there is.
[17:57.27]This is worth one.
[18:04.39]Looks like Louie died on impact.
[18:12.43]That's how they open with it?
[18:15.17]That would be horrible.
[18:16.49]Louis, the odd object before you appears to be one of the... Onions!
[18:20.59]Onions!
[18:21.37]Mentioned in Olimar's report.
[18:30.63]Hmm.
[18:31.55]And this is where you get the Pikmin from.
[18:32.89]This is where they are born.
[18:34.25]Hmm.
[18:38.76]The seed the onion ejected just sprouted.
[18:42.03]According to Olimar's report, it can be plucked with A. No fucking way.
[18:52.13]Oh, it does the Wiimote sounds too?
[18:56.77]Oh, he's so cute.
[19:01.76]This is a red Pikmin.
[19:02.78]They have fire damage.
[19:05.36]Maybe.
[19:05.48]Maybe.
[19:07.15]This must be one of the Pikmin creatures from Olimar's report.
[19:10.25]It is staring at you.
[19:13.39]You can press down on the D-pad to issue objectives to your Pikmin squad and direct their movement.
[19:20.98]You can disband your squad with C. Interesting.
[19:24.04]What the fuck is C?
[19:26.14]Oh.
[19:29.54]Olimar's description of the creatures resembling Pik-Pik carrots was strikingly accurate.
[19:38.43]Louie, my sensors have detected drool in the corner of your mouth.
[19:41.45]Are you alright?
[19:44.77]Well, he just got in like a fucking plane crash.
[19:47.29]What are you talking about?
[19:49.47]He's probably like really fucked up right now.
[19:51.47]Okay.
[20:03.92]So now it takes one to get the one coin, right?
[20:10.15]Oh, that's cool.
[20:12.59]Alright, go get that.
[20:21.06]Go get that.
[20:21.62]Hey, stupid.
[20:29.00]Go get that.
[20:29.46]I have to throw him?
[20:34.55]Why can't he just get it on his own?
[20:43.82]Ooh, it's worth one coin.
[20:45.68]Is there upgrades in this game?
[20:48.61]Eventually, am I going to be able to upgrade stuff?
[20:49.91]Because I will like it if there's upgrades.
[20:55.01]So these ones give me more Pikmin.
[20:58.75]Oh.
[21:02.45]Interesting.
[21:03.91]The onion ejected more seeds.
[21:05.21]The pellet from that flower must hold nutrients that breed Pikmin.
[21:08.29]Holy shit, this is cool.
[21:11.16]Yes, the Pikmin gather nutrients, haul them to the onion, and further propagate the species.
[21:17.82]The onion is a Pikmin mothership.
[21:21.46]Reviewing Olimar's report, it seems repeatedly tapping A lets one rapidly pluck Pikmin sprouts.
[21:28.26]Oh shit, okay.
[21:31.20]How many can I get?
[21:37.73]Oh, I just have to do it.
[21:38.45]Okay, so I have three.
[21:40.62]How do I call them back?
[21:41.88]Oh, I go... Alright, so that's down B in Smash Brothers.
[21:47.82]I get it.
[21:48.08]Alright, so you go get that one.
[21:50.58]You go get that one.
[21:51.66]You go get that one.
[21:52.44]Problem solved.
[21:58.86]Why am I getting -2 for that?
[22:02.21]That's just a fact.
[22:03.63]That's my only experience with Pikmin is being Olimar in Smash Brothers.
[22:10.56]Oh, that's cool.
[22:11.16]Okay.
[22:13.16]Let's get even more of them.
[22:18.96]How many can I have?
[22:19.72]What's this one worth?
[22:25.83]Get it!
[22:31.97]Olimar is the worst character?
[22:33.19]Wasn't he pretty high tier for a while?
[22:36.30]This game is legitimately hard.
[22:38.68]Have fun.
[22:40.82]Well, this game is legitimately hard.
[22:46.00]Have fun.
[22:46.48]Do they have a health bar?
[22:55.06]Okay.
[22:55.22]So now I've got, I've got 11 Pikmin.
[22:56.30]Where should we go?
[22:58.32]They're kind of slow.
[23:02.36]There's a Duracell battery.
[23:05.54]Wait, it's actually a Duracell batteries like branding in the game.
[23:11.22]Perhaps this object is one of the treasures that we are searching for.
[23:18.01]The only reason we found it here is because this is where you crash landed.
[23:21.17]How fortunate.
[23:23.31]I would like to appraise it, but you must regroup with Olimar first.
[23:26.41]Can you see him?
[23:28.53]Press Z to move the camera behind you.
[23:32.52]You can also press left or right to zoom it up or down to change angles.
[23:35.76]Okay, that's good to know.
[23:40.37]Because that's like just a turn camera.
[23:42.07]Oh, that's very important.
[23:43.87]That's disband the group, right?
[23:45.31]Oh, I don't want to do that.
[23:48.43]Alright, let's go to Olimar.
[23:49.67]Look, I've got friends too.
[23:52.71]Can I throw them over there?
[23:54.59]Hey.
[24:04.32]Hey.
[24:06.20]Hello?
[24:06.46]Can I pick this up?
[24:14.59]We, like, go into the bag?
[24:15.51]Alright, one of you go up there and investigate.
[24:21.17]One out of 15.
[24:22.25]What?
[24:27.65]I need more.
[24:28.51]Wait, can I switch back to Olimar?
[24:37.06]Oh, it's a puzzle game.
[24:48.38]Now what?
[24:52.10]It's going to be an RTS.
[24:53.10]We're going to have Olimar on the right side with 10 blue Pikmin, 5 purples.
[24:59.26]We're going to have Louis on the left side going to collect like a gold mine from somebody else's base or something with like 10 purples, right?
[25:06.00]Oh God, I'm going to lose my mind in this game.
[25:10.04]You're reunited at last.
[25:10.92]This has been a troublesome start to our trip.
[25:14.38]But now you must feel assured that your combined wits can get you through anything, correct?
[25:20.47]From now on, use B to form a single group, C to take solo action.
[25:25.56]And that's a change of leaders.
[25:26.48]Okay, form a single group, C to take solo action.
[25:31.12]Walk around by yourself, okay?
[25:36.71]So, okay, let's get everybody together, right?
[25:39.29]We got everybody?
[25:43.91]Let's take this, though.
[25:48.85]Come over here.
[25:49.91]I want you guys to get that.
[25:53.97]Yeah, all of you.
[25:55.11]Bring it back to the ship.
[25:56.07]Let's dissect it.
[25:58.33]And then some of you come over.
[25:59.27]Wait, wait, wait.
[25:59.79]I gotta get the battery.
[26:00.81]Oh, this is cool.
[26:03.57]I'm probably going to need 15 people to get the battery.
[26:07.61]How many people do you think it takes to get the battery?
[26:08.93]Alright, let's go get the battery.
[26:17.76]Where's it?
[26:17.98]Back here?
[26:23.81]How many?
[26:28.12]Takes.
[26:28.68]What's it doing?
[26:32.22]Why can't they get it?
[26:37.68]Dig it out.
[26:38.12]Oh, this is cool.
[26:40.22]Okay.
[26:40.58]Dig, dig, dig.
[26:41.90]And they're going to pull it out.
[26:48.98]I like this game.
[26:51.38]I like this game.
[26:52.78]Oh, I like this game.
[26:54.67]I like this game.
[26:55.25]A lot of people were potentially... Oh, I need 20.
[26:59.41]I don't have 20.
[27:03.27]We need another seed.
[27:05.29]Alright.
[27:08.43]You guys come with me.
[27:12.77]Wait.
[27:15.36]Hold on.
[27:15.58]We just...
[27:19.50]It's because we fed the machine a body?
[27:21.94]Is that enough?
[27:27.47]That's enough?
[27:27.83]We have to feed the machine bodies to make Pikmin.
[27:34.33]Alright, get in there.
[27:39.60]Give me that battery.
[27:40.36]It's probably worth like a thousand dollars.
[27:43.90]It's called recycling, Jeremy.
[27:47.17]Well, hold on.
[27:48.59]I need, I need like a, I gotta put like a notebook underneath my arm.
[27:51.59]In fact, I'm going to turn this way.
[27:54.69]I'm going to play sideways.
[27:56.02]You know, I'm going to put this on the other monitor.
[28:01.00]I'm playing sideways right now.
[28:03.64]Easier on my wrist, like rested on my arm, on wrist, arm wrist thing.
[28:09.96]Right now I'm sitting kind of sideways looking slightly to the right because my armrest thing for my chair is propping up my Wiimote so I can just wicked slowly and like slob like move this around.
[28:28.43]It's taking him a long time.
[28:40.12]Your hand is too shaky.
[28:45.64]Your cells are heavy.
[28:47.02]They're doing their best.
[28:48.53]I like this game.
[28:49.25]Alright, I'm probably going to like the first four or five hours of this game and I'm going to hate the rest of it.
[28:54.29]I just want to be very clear.
[29:02.73]280 bucks.
[29:04.84]Courage reactor.
[29:07.82]Oh, that's cool.
[29:14.80]I love the sound it makes.
[29:15.50]You hear that?
[29:18.48]That's... I love that noise.
[29:20.36]Cool.
[29:26.57]Our first day of exploration has yielded our first treasure.
[29:28.89]We will be done in record time.
[29:31.81]I took the liberty of naming it when I appraised it.
[29:33.79]The name reflects my current thinking.
[29:37.59]Leave it to me to think up catchy names for hit products.
[29:40.26]It is but one of my many talents.
[29:43.63]We shall end our first day here and report back to our president.
[29:47.27]His face will surely be joyous.
[29:50.81]However, to communicate with Hokotate, we must fly into low orbit above the planet.
[29:57.48]We will not return to the surface until morning so as to avoid the indigenous nocturnal creatures.
[30:01.70]That's Minecraft, okay?
[30:06.08]So you have to... During the... Oh my god, it's Minecraft.
[30:09.50]At night, you have to get out.
[30:10.86]It's timed.
[30:11.26]This is what you guys are talking about.
[30:19.81]Where's all the Pikmin?
[30:20.75]Oh.
[30:23.19]Yes, but -2.
[30:28.31]Oh, come on.
[30:28.77]It was one Bunger Burger.
[30:30.07]We could have taken him.
[30:30.67]Today's... I thought they said Toeclays.
[30:44.39]Today's report.
[30:47.56]There's money involved.
[30:51.42]You cash in money and you have storage of Pikmins.
[30:54.86]Do I spend this money?
[31:01.90]You found your first bit of treasure.
[31:03.04]Fine work.
[31:05.05]Our future depends on your efforts, so check your treasure hoard regularly.
[31:09.53]I'll check in often.
[31:10.53]Keep up the pace.
[31:13.53]Definitely safe.
[31:21.38]Here's the song.
[31:29.60]Treasure hoard.
[31:30.26]Oh, cool.
[31:33.95]Zoom in on it.
[31:37.29]What about the journal?
[31:37.85]What does it say?
[31:40.03]We've recovered our first treasure.
[31:41.59]Amazingly, the Pikmin remembered how to salvage it.
[31:46.23]Oh.
[31:47.62]I can't understand their adorable language, and I don't know what they're thinking.
[31:52.24]Yet I am so happy to see them.
[31:54.22]When I crashed on this planet, the Pikmin helped me locate my missing ship's parts.
[31:59.28]In my darkest hour, the Pikmin were there for me.
[32:02.82]Now that I'm reunited with them, I know everything will be alright.
[32:07.09]It will, right, Gordon?
[32:15.17]Ooh, this is new things in the Piklopedia.
[32:19.59]Why are you Professor Oak?
[32:21.75]I don't know who that is.
[32:22.45]Let's go to the area.
[32:30.02]Valley above ground.
[32:31.10]Day two.
[32:32.94]I kind of just sit and listen to this music.
[32:36.36]What?
[32:36.50]Excuse me, what?
[32:37.62]What are you talking about?
[32:40.20]How what?
[32:40.64]How what?
[32:41.02]What's going on?
[32:43.30]What do you want?
[32:48.66]Pretending.
[32:49.02]What happened?
[32:54.50]Professor Oak.
[32:57.02]What?
[32:59.52]Somebody said I sounded like Professor Oak.
[33:05.37]What?
[33:05.55]What's going on?
[33:07.61]I'm freaking out right now.
[33:08.51]What are you guys talking about?
[33:14.25]It's a career ending statement.
[33:17.50]I don't understand what's going on.
[33:18.72]Somebody said, you sound like Professor Oak.
[33:20.08]And I was like, oh, I don't know what that is.
[33:21.48]Professor Oak from Pokémon.
[33:26.08]I don't know who that is.
[33:27.54]I have no idea who that is.
[33:28.70]I don't know who Professor Oak is.
[33:31.92]Guys, there's like 5,000 NPCs in those games.
[33:35.16]I've never played Pokémon.
[33:38.62]I don't know who that is.
[33:40.18]Is that the guy that assesses the Pokémon?
[33:43.02]I don't know who Professor Oak is.
[33:47.25]I have not consumed even maybe 30 minutes total of Pokémon.
[33:51.70]And you know, it was probably watching the intro of the, like, the Pokémon.
[33:55.88]Gotta catch them.
[33:57.02]You and me.
[33:58.60]We'll do it our destiny.
[34:00.94]Like 15 years ago when that meme was out.
[34:02.94]I don't know.
[34:03.24]I think I've never seen it.
[34:04.24]I don't care.
[34:09.31]I thought something was wrong.
[34:10.91]I was like, I don't know who that is.
[34:13.33]Like, Professor Oak, I don't play Pokémon.
[34:14.81]And I look over at chat and it's like...
[34:17.48]It's as if I, like, shit, like, diarrhea-ed in my pants and you heard it.
[34:21.06]And it was like, what the fuck was that?
[34:22.48]Dude, he should've... I heard, like, diarrhea sounds.
[34:24.90]Like, is he alright?
[34:25.62]What's happening?
[34:26.06]Is he sitting in his own shit?
[34:27.90]What happened?
[34:37.57]I don't... I don't know who Professor Oak is.
[34:46.53]Wait, hold on.
[34:47.97]Let me, I gotta ask.
[34:49.08]Is Professor Oak the character that has the lab coat on and he has like the spiky white hair and he works in the Pokémon Center?
[35:01.14]Yes.
[35:01.76]Alright.
[35:02.34]Okay, I know who that guy is.
[35:04.72]I didn't know what his name was.
[35:06.77]And on top of that, I don't know what he sounds like.
[35:10.09]I just, I've seen like a picture of him.
[35:13.34]Good morning, workers.
[35:14.74]Ready for another day of toiling the profit of your company?
[35:19.14]The Pikmin seem to still be asleep inside their onion.
[35:22.64]What lazy creatures.
[35:27.33]No wonder they lack survival skills.
[35:28.79]Stand beneath the onion and press A to call them.
[35:31.81]I'm not going to stop doing that.
[35:32.77]I'm sorry.
[35:37.75]Let's call them up.
[35:42.87]Everybody, how many do we want?
[35:43.95]Take out or return Pikmin?
[35:45.48]Wait, I have a finite amount?
[35:47.78]Not yet.
[35:48.06]Let's assess the area.
[35:49.96]How much time do I have?
[35:50.64]Oh, shit.
[35:53.06]Get that.
[35:53.32]I'm going to take 10.
[35:57.42]10.
[35:57.44]Come on out.
[36:08.41]Five of you get that.
[36:09.03]The other five of us are going the other way.
[36:11.21]Oh my god.
[36:12.41]Wait, just... Is that five?
[36:15.47]How many are in there?
[36:16.99]One, two, three, four, five.
[36:18.84]You... How many do I have?
[36:19.66]Five?
[36:21.72]Shit.
[36:22.08]I should have taken eleven.
[36:26.58]Take all of them?
[36:27.16]If they die, they're gone permanently though.
[36:35.71]No fear.
[36:36.43]Take them.
[36:36.77]Okay, fine.
[36:41.45]Anybody get that one?
[36:44.75]How many need to be on here?
[36:45.59]35?
[36:48.11]Do I even have that many?
[36:53.63]Hurry up.
[36:53.89]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[36:55.47]Oh shit, there's some right here too.
[37:04.76]Get that.
[37:06.40]Any up here?
[37:11.53]Oh my god, there's so much to explore.
[37:12.79]There's nothing up here.
[37:13.77]Alright, pull them out.
[37:23.06]Only 35.
[37:25.68]Picking them up.
[37:26.26]Pull them out.
[37:31.02]So many activities.
[37:31.92]There really are.
[37:34.59]Okay.
[37:35.70]I have to... I gotta... I'm gonna make you guys happy.
[37:39.58]Or some of you angry.
[37:42.10]I never gave this game a chance.
[37:44.30]Because I didn't know it was like this.
[37:46.56]I thought it was like level 1.
[37:48.30]Go.
[37:48.96]Level 2.
[37:49.86]Go.
[37:51.38]I didn't think it was this open sort of... You just go collect treasure and coins and stuff.
[37:59.45]I was unaware of that.
[38:02.25]Nice.
[38:02.53]We got it.
[38:02.81]Alright.
[38:03.07]This is definitely going to be like an old toy.
[38:05.41]Kill.
[38:06.61]Kill.
[38:09.37]And then eat his body.
[38:12.22]Somebody die?
[38:12.64]Alright.
[38:14.26]Get out.
[38:14.68]Go.
[38:14.90]Let's go.
[38:15.30]Oh my God.
[38:15.60]I love this game.
[38:16.26]Alright.
[38:16.48]Let's keep going.
[38:18.74]Wait a minute.
[38:19.08]There's a big guy.
[38:26.44]Don't wake him up yet.
[38:27.12]Hold on.
[38:29.24]What's over here?
[38:30.88]Is it a crushed can?
[38:37.36]35.
[38:37.58]Okay, can we get this without waking him up?
[38:43.78]Alright, nobody get that.
[38:45.34]You know what?
[38:45.72]Oh, wait, wait.
[38:47.08]Louie, you... Wait, separate.
[38:51.30]Louie, you stay... Oh, Lamar, you stay here in case shit hits the fan.
[39:01.56]This is on GameCube.
[39:02.34]This is on the... Technically, the Wii U. Oh, fuck.
[39:10.13]This is the Wii version on the Wii U. Yeah, it's pretty good.
[39:19.25]When are you going to play Smash Brothers?
[39:24.17]No, I got completely turned off forever from playing Smash Brothers.
[39:26.68]Ever.
[39:27.54]Ever again.
[39:27.88]I already told you what happened.
[39:31.16]I did that... That single player mode was cool for a little while.
[39:34.78]There's almost too much content in there though.
[39:39.83]It was like 60 hours of content in there, and it was kind of overwhelming.
[39:44.17]That was cool, though.
[39:45.75]But I played online two or three matches with the Talics.
[39:49.43]We just were like, yeah, let's get... Dude, I'm going to start.
[39:51.72]I'm going to get good with Simon Belmont.
[39:53.38]You just watch me.
[39:53.92]I'm going to start.
[39:54.38]I'm going to get good with him.
[39:56.52]We played two or three online matches together just hanging out.
[39:59.46]We got beat so badly three or four times in a row.
[40:03.32]This is a true statement.
[40:05.22]Neither one of us has ever played the game again.
[40:08.46]I have not turned it on since that happened to us.
[40:13.29]We just were looking at each other just after like four or five matches of getting... Let's just say we all had two stock.
[40:20.74]We couldn't even get anybody on the other team past like 100% on their first stock.
[40:28.26]It was awful.
[40:29.56]So we never played ever again.
[40:31.93]It's not going to wake him up, is it?
[40:39.39]Stay asleep.
[40:43.77]Get on there.
[40:46.41]Kill the big guy first.
[40:50.44]I don't want to lose any Pikmin.
[40:55.16]Are we doing this?
[41:01.90]Oh, Olimar's over.
[41:03.10]Can I fight with Olimar?
[41:04.99]Oh shit, you can punch.
[41:07.26]Alright, I guess we're going to go for it.
[41:11.34]You ready?
[41:11.76]Attack!
[41:26.27]Holy shit.
[41:26.79]We got it.
[41:27.15]Anybody die?
[41:32.33]We got them.
[41:35.96]Oh, nobody else can do it.
[41:36.72]Okay.
[41:38.77]Wait, some of you guys get the can.
[41:46.89]Oh, this is perfect tactic.
[41:48.13]Push it over.
[41:48.64]Just keep pushing it.
[41:55.80]I need everybody for this one.
[41:59.22]How many Pikmin might I get for this?
[42:01.42]Don't ever attack the face.
[42:04.26]Oh, okay.
[42:10.70]oh that's what his voice sounds like what was I doing I was like oh Gordon alright so let me get that right what are you doing back here you too I'm talking about this oh okay
[42:48.17]Stop that.
[42:49.67]Do not.
[42:53.69]Goku.
[42:56.57]I see it every time.
[42:58.61]Every low voice is just Mr. Satan.
[43:00.95]I know.
[43:01.83]I'm sorry.
[43:02.45]Alright.
[43:07.28]Help.
[43:07.74]Get over there.
[43:13.79]Get on it!
[43:14.85]Oh, fuck.
[43:15.45]I'm sorry.
[43:21.59]Is it everybody on it?
[43:22.41]That I can be on it?
[43:25.37]I guess so.
[43:31.94]So how can... What does red mean then?
[43:34.92]So red is capacity 2, right?
[43:37.70]Number plus 10 is usually the max.
[43:39.38]Okay.
[43:42.93]Red means stop it.
[43:45.57]I got 450 bucks.
[43:47.90]There's still a whole day here.
[43:48.84]Where should I go?
[43:50.34]This way?
[43:51.86]Where have I gone?
[43:58.05]Oh my god.
[43:58.95]Okay.
[43:59.49]Is there anything back here?
[44:10.98]Could go... Should I go this way?
[44:13.99]Let's go over here.
[44:16.39]Break that wall.
[44:17.27]What wall?
[44:19.59]Break the wall?
[44:20.11]Hold on.
[44:21.15]Anything over here?
[44:24.09]This is the wrong way.
[44:28.59]I just want to see if there's anything over here.
[44:35.03]Oh!
[44:40.07]On Wiimote.
[44:41.27]Hey, motion controls.
[44:42.07]Fuck you.
[44:42.53]Alright, go for it.
[44:53.56]Relax.
[44:57.54]Use a GameCube controller instead.
[44:58.84]I feel like I'll get used to this.
[45:01.49]I'm already starting to.
[45:04.31]There's a wall.
[45:05.47]Let me see.
[45:05.93]Hold on.
[45:06.39]These guys are kind of slow.
[45:13.06]Where was this wall?
[45:26.36]Wall.
[45:28.30]Do I have enough time to do this?
[45:33.08]Come on, hurry up.
[45:42.84]Oh, shit.
[45:43.36]There's a wall here.
[45:45.08]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[45:46.10]Go, go, go.
[45:48.60]Get on there.
[45:57.31]Break it down.
[45:59.55]No, no, no.
[46:01.55]Wrong button.
[46:03.11]No, wrong button.
[46:06.27]What is it?
[46:06.63]Down?
[46:07.23]What button is it?
[46:09.40]Okay.
[46:09.98]I don't like that.
[46:11.82]I'll tell you a reason why.
[46:14.30]okay so the wiimote the wiimote's controller is not four buttons it's just if you press down on the wiimote sometimes you'll press left or right on the d-pad not a fan of that get it we help
[46:42.96]Apparently not.
[46:43.50]You told this to me like 45 minutes ago.
[47:10.77]Proceed to disband the group, point at the screen, and press down on the D to issue... Are they imagining that somebody else walked in the room that likes Louie and is like, oh, what does Louie do?
[47:21.89]Why are they doing this again?
[47:28.91]Press down on D to swarm Pikmin on treasure and enemies or make them march in a line.
[47:36.86]It's just recapping.
[47:37.70]Oh, okay.
[47:44.55]Wait, don't put him into this geyser.
[47:45.99]What is this?
[47:49.13]It's for old people and children.
[47:53.14]Right.
[47:53.44]Interesting.
[47:53.86]Warm air is welling up from the hole in the ground before you.
[47:59.18]What could lie underground?
[48:00.44]What is wrong?
[48:01.04]You both show expressions of unease.
[48:04.39]Do not fear.
[48:04.89]The leaders group of Pikmin will join you.
[48:07.51]I shall dispatch my research pod.
[48:10.43]What's in there?
[48:12.45]Approach the hole and press A to jump in.
[48:15.97]well I'm sorry we're gonna have to do the pebble test here we're gonna do the rock test first uh Mr. tin can whatever your name is you grab a rock and you let it go in there and you just put your ear over and you see and wait until you hear the noise you don't oh yeah just go jump on in what I mean why would I do that you let the rock go and you put your over so you could you stand over there and go drop
[48:45.71]We ain't going in that one.
[48:47.15]I'm sorry.
[48:47.65]I guess we're going in.
[48:57.86]Wait, I don't have enough time.
[48:58.88]Do I have time to do this?
[49:04.41]Alright, Louie.
[49:06.13]I need you to come over here.
[49:08.73]You take some and I'll take some.
[49:12.86]How many should I... I need 50?
[49:14.76]Stop, stop, stop.
[49:15.74]Time stops in caves.
[49:16.92]Oh.
[49:18.70]Alright, how many do I want?
[49:22.99]I'll go in there with 50.
[49:28.97]Take them all.
[49:29.53]I thought I could only take 50.
[49:30.17]Wait, what?
[49:35.27]Oh, okay, I have 59.
[49:36.07]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[49:38.94]I don't know why my brain... I thought that... I don't know.
[49:40.72]My brain's insane.
[49:51.77]The game has been saved.
[49:59.79]Did you notice how half-assed that was?
[50:01.81]I started to think about doing it and then I kind of gave up halfway through and I pulled back really hard.
[50:07.87]Yeah.
[50:09.29]I gave up halfway through that one.
[50:10.49]I wasn't sure about that one.
[50:13.24]Intriguing.
[50:13.72]My heart sensors indicate that this hole has life in it.
[50:17.66]It's warmer than on the surface.
[50:21.64]Analyzing.
[50:23.08]Suggest danger lies ahead.
[50:25.32]But the promise of treasure is tantalizing.
[50:29.07]If you wish to check underground terrain, press the plus sign to communicate with me.
[50:35.39]I am not just a ship.
[50:36.39]I am an all-purpose support pod.
[50:37.81]Do you have any guns?
[50:42.62]Alright, split up.
[50:52.08]I want to take, like, 25.
[50:53.10]Olimar, you take this group.
[50:57.09]Louie, you take this group.
[51:00.45]Here we go.
[51:00.83]We're going Louie first.
[51:03.11]Get everybody in the right spot.
[51:05.83]Oh, shit.
[51:06.39]I just zoomed out into the fog of war that I could see, and I see that Red is desperately trying to group up his enemies 30 feet away from my base, and he doesn't think I can fucking see him do that.
[51:16.94]Okay.
[51:24.43]What's that?
[51:31.01]Take it.
[51:31.65]Whatever it is.
[51:35.28]Alright.
[51:36.70]Why am I splitting up?
[51:37.40]Why do I need to split up?
[51:38.12]Everybody come with me.
[51:38.62]Are we going to fight?
[51:44.30]Are we fighting?
[51:46.02]Are they hostile?
[51:49.27]Get him!
[51:49.49]Get him!
[51:58.13]550.
[51:58.43]Nice.
[51:59.63]7-Up.
[51:59.87]I love 7-Up.
[52:00.57]It's way better than Sprite.
[52:02.99]Fight!
[52:05.87]Fight!
[52:07.45]Oh my god, this fucking Wii mode is going to drive me insane.
[52:13.01]I'm telling you, pressing down on the Wii mode was the worst idea ever.
[52:20.47]Kill it!
[52:25.57]Alright, how much does it take to get this fruit thing?
[52:27.05]Take it out.
[52:34.72]Just throw them?
[52:35.98]Throw them.
[52:36.40]It squishes the enemies.
[52:37.46]Oh.
[52:40.02]How can you possibly consider this beast a treasure?
[52:44.20]Beasts are incompatible with my circuitry.
[52:48.41]I suppose I will store your finds in my hold.
[52:51.93]But I do think... I do not think beasts will be worth much.
[52:56.00]Well, can I turn them into Pikmin?
[52:57.11]I thought that was the point.
[52:59.39]Alright, we're good.
[53:08.95]What about this thing?
[53:12.84]We go in this?
[53:16.16]This hole appears to be quite deep.
[53:17.66]My sensors indicate more treacherous terrain.
[53:20.18]Oh, shit.
[53:21.50]Louie, do you recall that you can adjust the camera with Z...
[53:26.84]And up, left, and right on that.
[53:29.44]Yes.
[53:32.25]Your expression suggested you are... You do.
[53:33.85]Yes, I do.
[53:35.69]Don't worry.
[53:36.19]All your Pikmin will follow you.
[53:37.33]Approach the hole and press A to enter it.
[53:40.71]I only have like five.
[53:46.07]Can't do this today.
[53:47.69]I need to put this orange in.
[53:50.68]Wait, you want me to go down there and just have everybody get killed?
[53:53.24]That doesn't sound like a fun time.
[54:03.00]Oh wait, maybe I should.
[54:08.93]How much is an orange worth?
[54:09.73]180.
[54:12.75]Citrus lump.
[54:14.38]What did I call it?
[54:15.08]Fruit thing?
[54:18.82]Oh, wait a minute.
[54:19.26]We still have... Only one person died.
[54:20.72]That's it.
[54:22.50]I'm going for it.
[54:23.48]Time is stopped here, right?
[54:32.64]What's going?
[54:33.00]Four died.
[54:37.92]They did?
[54:45.00]Send a letter.
[54:45.60]This goes even deeper.
[54:52.88]Oh, I had 59.
[54:55.68]Final floor.
[54:56.66]Oh, shit.
[54:57.20]Okay, this is the... This is important.
[55:04.80]This is very important.
[55:05.70]Get the camera in the right place.
[55:09.91]Alright, everybody come with me.
[55:16.01]Kill it.
[55:16.53]Good.
[55:17.11]Alright, yeah, now pick it up.
[55:23.53]Deliver that.
[55:24.07]Ooh, a glow!
[55:32.68]It's inconceivable that such an immense object has been buried here for so long.
[55:36.00]The design on the outer shell resembles the surface of the planet as seen from space.
[55:44.37]Perhaps this can be used for something other than salvage.
[55:47.05]Is it a map?
[55:50.47]How will we ever lift it?
[55:51.51]I fear that even a hundred red Pikmin will be unable to lift it.
[55:55.79]What?
[55:59.22]What?
[55:59.86]What do you mean?
[56:01.40]We can't get it?
[56:07.22]No, we have to be able to get that.
[56:10.80]Come on.
[56:12.34]Okay, well, it's like a Metroid game.
[56:14.70]I'm going to come back here with the forklift and lift it up.
[56:20.92]Oh, fuck.
[56:21.30]Kill him.
[56:24.52]How am I not landing on him?
[56:26.70]You know what to do.
[56:27.60]Get it.
[56:27.80]Good job, guys.
[56:36.84]Kill.
[56:37.66]Good.
[56:38.16]You know what to do.
[56:40.45]We'll bring the bodies back.
[56:44.07]Kind of running out of Pikmin though.
[56:45.77]Okay.
[56:51.81]Get that one too.
[56:52.71]How many do I have?
[56:55.83]23?
[56:56.47]What is this?
[57:01.88]This must be, I think this is a new Pikmin.
[57:04.20]Yep, it's going to be a blue Pikmin.
[57:06.88]Astounding, a flower blooms in a cave deep beneath the snowy landscape.
[57:14.95]Clearly it is warmer down here than above.
[57:17.31]Look, the Pikmin are restless.
[57:19.91]Purple, oh.
[57:22.77]It looks as if they yearn to be tossed into the flower.
[57:37.22]And it makes a purple.
[57:40.56]And the purples are strong, right?
[57:41.91]The purples are really powerful.
[57:43.17]I remember that.
[57:44.57]It didn't fly very far, but they did a ton of damage when they hit somebody in Smash Bros.
[57:52.93]What should I get?
[57:53.47]Like 10?
[57:56.99]I don't want to get rid of all my Pikmin.
[58:04.52]All of them?
[58:05.00]What do you mean all?
[58:06.06]What?
[58:12.79]Do all... What?
[58:15.69]Why would I want to do that?
[58:25.06]Amazing, a purple Pikmin.
[58:26.24]It has hair and is quite stocky.
[58:28.52]It seems very heavy and strong.
[58:33.22]Each flower can only make five.
[58:34.88]Oh, okay.
[58:37.46]Polobar, this... Pikmin is an entirely new type of Pikmin.
[58:42.83]Transforming Pikmin by tossing them into flowers.
[58:44.79]Intriguing.
[58:45.45]Perhaps there are others.
[58:49.19]Alright, so we're going to get ten big guys.
[58:56.32]There's a fat Pikmin.
[58:57.12]Yeah, and they're worth like five red Pikmin, right?
[59:16.93]Throw it faster.
[59:17.67]Now we can get the globe.
[59:20.55]Yeah.
[59:20.79]I think that's it, right?
[59:28.06]Alright.
[59:28.32]I think that's it.
[59:36.74]Is there a way to... Oh, this is going to be hard.
[59:42.04]Globe.
[59:42.68]Let's get it.
[59:51.09]Go up the geyser.
[59:51.89]Pepe left.
[59:55.67]Okay.
[59:57.45]They're so slow.
[59:59.39]Come on.
[59:59.69]Get over there.
[60:02.11]Get it.
[60:03.76]Get in there.
[60:04.50]A hundred.
[60:05.16]A hundred.
[60:19.35]What's it going to be worth?
[60:23.18]Alright, I'm going to show this link.
[60:25.95]Links, I'm going to tell you.
[60:27.61]Let's go over this really quickly.
[60:30.03]Links are going to be completely removed from chat.
[60:34.01]Permanently.
[60:35.68]In the very near future.
[60:37.88]And it's going to be replaced.
[60:39.86]Links are going to go somewhere else that I can pull from that are not in the chat.
[60:44.22]so they're not being removed from the stream they're being removed from chat it will be a nice solution where you can post a link somewhere and it can be looked at and then I can get a hold of it it's just not going to be in chat anymore oh keep that in mind that's it 200 bucks uh let me just show this on stream real quick because I found it to be a little humorous
[61:28.51]This view is humorous.
[61:30.63]Don't use Discord.
[61:31.43]I'm not going to use Discord.
[61:32.63]It's going to be its own potential custom solution.
[61:37.74]We'll find out.
[61:38.16]I'm going to do a little research.
[61:42.10]This is a device resembling a microchip embedded inside the sphere, retrieving the data.
[61:47.36]I could only decode a portion of the data, but I did retrieve new geographic charts.
[61:50.62]Ooh new location Put it in somebody else's chat.
[62:01.14]Oh my god.
[62:02.10]Can you imagine how dog shit that would be?
[62:06.46]That would be the most unbelievably awful way to do that
[62:14.77]Put it in somebody else's chat.
[62:17.73]I just make a new account.
[62:19.55]It's just Jerma.
[62:20.51]It's twitch.tv.
[62:21.33]I'm not even going to say it because it's too late.
[62:24.63]Whatever.
[62:24.89]It's just like a link.
[62:27.51]It's just a chat.
[62:28.21]It's just full of links.
[62:34.08]That is not the solution, by the way.
[62:36.00]But how fucked up would that be?
[62:37.34]That's so stupid.
[62:39.22]Okay, exploration kit.
[62:53.14]Now that we have this new data, you should explore the decoded territory tomorrow.
[62:58.90]That's total keel.
[63:00.76]K-E-W-L.
[63:02.06]Keel.
[63:02.56]Alright, is everybody here?
[63:05.66]We didn't leave anybody behind, right?
[63:06.64]I think we're good.
[63:08.56]Let's go.
[63:12.64]Oh, that's not a portal.
[63:21.49]I can't wait to see like the guitar version of that song.
[63:47.45]How did you lie about Mr. Slime?
[63:48.91]I didn't lie about Mr. Slime.
[63:50.07]It just was a lot of things I had to do.
[63:51.86]Didn't we already go over this?
[63:57.98]Thinking of something fun to do or an idea that might be fun to do is not me telling you that it's going to happen in three days.
[64:07.53]Like, oh man, you know what would be awesome?
[64:09.45]I wish Cheetos would make a hot version, but have it be like a Chipotle hot version.
[64:16.11]That's a good idea.
[64:18.58]And like a year later, they don't make that.
[64:20.92]You can't be mad at me for coming up with like an idea.
[64:23.58]Why don't those Cheetos exist, Jeremy?
[64:25.79]You thought about that.
[64:26.93]That would have been delicious.
[64:27.85]I fucking hate you.
[64:34.49]Well, I guess I would be like the CEO of the Cheetos company, right?
[64:37.35]In that case.
[64:39.25]But even still, if the CEO of the Cheetos company is like, hey, you know what would be really delicious?
[64:44.20]If we had a Cool Ranch Cheeto.
[64:48.13]That's a good idea.
[64:48.89]You should do it.
[64:49.82]Maybe.
[64:50.22]I don't know.
[64:50.52]We got other things from the pipeline.
[64:52.74]Fuck you.
[64:54.94]But wait.
[64:56.14]Try our new flavor.
[64:57.00]We got like five flavors coming out in the next couple of months.
[64:59.96]Try one of those.
[65:01.66]Not as good.
[65:02.24]When are you going to put cat ears on, CEO?
[65:21.54]Let's go, back to the surface.
[65:24.81]Cry, cry, one voice Andy.
[65:27.35]Hey, you know what?
[65:34.36]I'll be five voice Andy, okay?
[65:36.14]Okay.
[65:38.02]I'm going to tell you right now, I'm going to stand up for myself a little bit here.
[65:43.30]I might be five voice Andy, but would you rather me be like 30 voice Andy and 25 voices are terrible?
[65:49.47]Or would you rather have completely calculated, clean, cool, five perfect voices that can be used in a million scenarios?
[65:57.67]You want like 30 or 40 crappy voices that you're like, ah, that wasn't that good.
[66:01.83]Or would you rather have completely refined five to six complete voice work
[66:25.78]Your five voices suck.
[66:30.60]I want you to record yourself doing this.
[66:32.60]And I want you to send it to me tomorrow.
[66:38.41]I am the most unbelievably unstoppable force.
[66:43.87]I want you to record yourself doing that and send it to me tomorrow.
[67:01.99]Don't ask for that the challenge that's not a challenge I just was talking to one person Challenge accepted no I did I don't do that by the way that takes years of training
[67:20.56]That's hard to do, and it can hurt you.
[67:23.02]That low, gravelly, deep into the chest voice, that took me 30 fucking years to get that right.
[67:29.47]Be careful.
[67:30.69]I'm not issuing any challenges here.
[67:34.23]No challenges.
[67:39.31]It's difficult to do that work.
[67:41.84]I've missed all this dialog.
[67:43.30]Fuck.
[67:53.32]30 years olomar and Louis since you will explore a new area tomorrow today's work is done
[68:03.77]do that also not a challenge by the way no when I said you I was referring to like the collective and when I meant do that I meant like do it as in like existentially like nobody can do that I can do that right that's what I meant by that like you as in collectively you and do that as in like I bet you couldn't like because I'm like collectively speaking like in existential terms there's a backtrack no okay
[68:33.60]When I say you guys, right?
[68:35.86]I'm not referring to like one single person sitting in their room.
[68:41.64]Otherwise, I would say, hey, Dave Anderson watching the stream right now.
[68:48.41]I hope you had a really good birthday last week.
[68:51.45]And that I'm directly addressing one of you.
[68:59.74]It's always Dave.
[69:00.88]Why can't it be somebody else?
[69:13.94]No, don't do anything.
[69:15.46]I'm kidding around.
[69:16.52]It's a joke.
[69:17.78]What's so special about Dave?
[69:26.98]I don't know.
[69:28.04]The easiest name to remember.
[69:30.49]I guess I want a little bit of insight into my brain.
[69:33.61]It's very, very difficult for me to come up with first and last real names.
[69:41.11]If I sit here and try to come up with a name, Mike, Dave, John, Smith, Anderson, Stevenson.
[69:53.52]I don't, it's hard to come up with like a full name.
[70:02.73]Jeremy, but that's my name.
[70:04.64]That's not me making up another name.
[70:06.06]That's me just using my name.
[70:08.64]Just say Andy.
[70:15.36]Just say Andy.
[70:19.66]But here's the thing.
[70:20.66]We don't come up with names for people anymore.
[70:23.04]We come up with the thing that they did and then add Andy to it.
[70:28.00]It used to be you'd put that shit in quotes.
[70:31.51]Like, it was like, oh, Jimmy the Schnage.
[70:35.10]Uh... Acapella or something, right?
[70:38.64]Now it's just Schnage Andy.
[70:46.24]We don't come up with, like, full names anymore.
[70:49.36]We just give them, like, kind of a description and then add Andy to it.
[70:52.96]It's kind of ruined my way to process people's names.
[71:06.32]handy but you know what I mean though like twitches it started like get into my brain even emotes and stuff like I don't even I'm 35 guys I'm older I'm an older gentleman and there's no reason I'll randomly just think of oh that was so cool pog I don't even talk like that though I don't even talk like that it's just in the head
[71:38.29]I have never said that out loud, but internally, I say that.
[71:42.47]That, like, MonkaS, I internalize that.
[71:45.06]If something's scary, I'm like, oh, shit, like, MonkaS, like, fuck.
[71:50.48]Language is sort of changing.
[71:54.58]You can, emotes are becoming, you can, like, communicate with emotes now.
[72:00.26]They used to do this stuff back in, like, the hieroglyphics days.
[72:06.53]Hieroglyphics are coming back.
[72:09.39]You having a midlife crisis?
[72:10.57]Yeah, yes, absolutely.
[72:12.32]This is absolutely what that is.
[72:14.50]So, yeah.
[72:21.22]Oh, I want to look at these.
[72:28.62]The purple Pikmin were somehow able to carry this.
[72:32.16]Now I'm getting in my head because I have five voice Andy.
[72:34.86]No, excuse me.
[72:36.12]Sorry, I'm going to rephrase that.
[72:38.06]Jeremy
[72:41.14]Goofy Voice Elbertson.
[72:44.55]There.
[72:45.29]I'm not doing that anymore.
[72:50.25]The purple Pikmin were somehow able to carry this massive treasure.
[72:53.90]Today, we measured their physical strength using a ship's onboard beef-a-beater.
[72:59.74]It seems that they have ten times the weight and physical power of any Pikmin.
[73:04.80]When I throw them, they land with a resounding thud.
[73:08.80]I've decided to commemorate the cave I first encountered them by naming it an Emergence Cave.
[73:16.23]Mr. Potter.
[73:20.70]I can't even read this shit.
[73:21.80]We're gonna go back.
[73:27.20]Kylo Ren Auto.
[73:33.50]Oh, give me a break.
[73:36.08]Awakening Woods, let's go.
[73:42.38]What the fuck is this game?
[73:43.96]Wait, hold on.
[73:46.30]Are you hooing Pikmin?
[73:49.95]That's not possible, is it?
[73:50.93]When did the last Pikmin come out?
[73:51.89]Pikmin 3?
[73:52.57]Pikmin 4?
[74:03.11]Morning.
[74:03.51]How are you?
[74:05.09]It should be pleased you to know that the purple Pikmin are lodged safely in my hole.
[74:10.79]The confines of my interior seem to suit them perfectly.
[74:13.37]Though they do occasionally tickle me.
[74:18.88]That wasn't Bernie.
[74:22.04]That was supposed to be Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[74:34.48]I have to focus.
[74:36.42]I have to focus.
[74:42.40]Good morning.
[74:44.14]How are you?
[74:45.18]Fuck, that is Bernie.
[74:47.75]Good morning.
[74:49.07]How are you?
[74:50.69]How are you?
[74:51.63]Good morning.
[74:52.53]Good morning.
[74:53.77]Fuck.
[74:55.17]It is.
[74:55.55]No, but it's not though.
[74:56.37]It's kind of not.
[74:58.05]Stand in the ring of light below and press A to call the purple Pikmin out.
[75:08.31]Okay.
[75:09.45]Let's get the purples.
[75:14.13]I want
[75:16.39]30 red Pikmin.
[75:18.39]And then Louie, I want you to get purple Pikmin.
[75:27.77]I want five purple.
[75:29.68]All?
[75:29.98]I don't want to take all.
[75:31.92]All?
[75:32.22]What?
[75:35.30]What if they die?
[75:43.80]Jeremy, Elbertson, Andy.
[75:52.16]Now for the bonus lesson.
[75:52.96]First, press and hold A to pick up a Pikmin.
[75:54.84]Then, while you hold A, press B to swap between different colored Pikmin.
[75:59.37]Hmm.
[76:19.17]This is the first time you've heard this, Olimar.
[76:20.97]Remember to properly train new employees.
[76:27.70]Alright, that's cool.
[76:28.76]Yeah, you guys are going to be at work.

[77:21.53]Kill it.
[77:25.05]Kill it!
[77:26.77]Just kill everything.
[77:28.87]And pick it up.
[77:31.35]Nice.
[77:31.67]Okay.
[77:33.93]I'm gonna get that.
[77:38.16]Oh, there's a big one over here.
[77:39.68]We'll group up after this.

[77:44.98]Very cool.
[77:48.32]Cool.
[77:54.36]Alright.
[77:54.98]There's more.
[77:56.82]What's the actual cap?
[77:58.45]Is it 100?
[78:05.45]It's 200.
[78:06.33]Holy shit.
[78:07.29]We could handle that?
[78:13.28]No, no, no, no, no.
[78:17.66]100 in a party.

[78:18.98]Alright, let's do it.

[78:42.61]Yes.
[78:43.19]Cool.
[78:43.53]Alright, now get these, too.
[78:47.63]Somebody pick up those.
[78:50.00]Alright, and then... The rest of you...

[79:03.03]There's a strawberry up there.
[79:08.47]Hell yeah.
[79:10.03]Alright, we're all gonna... We're just gonna rush into his back.
[79:13.51]Let's rush into his back.
[79:18.00]All of you at the same time, all run into his back.
[79:26.96]Get him!
[79:27.58]He died.
[79:36.03]Alright, bring it.
[79:41.40]Good job, everybody.
[79:50.56]Throw for crits.
[79:51.52]Oh, okay.
[79:52.72]Throw purples at the back.
[79:53.78]Okay.
[79:55.04]Thanks for the tip.
[79:57.01]You're wasting time.
[79:57.81]I am.
[80:01.17]Wait.
[80:02.35]What's over here?
[80:04.64]I just, like, hiccuped.
[80:06.20]What is over here?
[80:06.72]What's this?
[80:07.54]Honey?
[80:13.33]They- Oh, they've ranked up!
[80:21.64]They matured into flower Pikmin.
[80:23.26]It appears to have enhanced their motor skills.
[80:26.54]What a wondrous nectar.
[80:27.48]How intriguing.
[80:30.10]Like planets.
[80:31.40]Like plants, Pikmin mature from leaf to bud to flower.
[80:34.96]Captain Olimar, you must share the information you have with your subordinate, Louie.
[80:38.64]Uh-oh.
[80:47.20]We have too much population?
[80:51.86]Olimar, we have a problem.
[80:52.82]The onion has ceased ejecting seeds.
[80:54.59]Is it malfunctioning?
[80:56.65]Interesting.
[80:57.05]It now seems the number of lifeforms within the onion has increased.
[81:01.54]Didn't you note that no more than 100 Pikmin will venture into the planet at once?
[81:07.62]But I currently observe only 95 on the surface.
[81:10.36]Could there be wild Pikmin somewhere?
[81:12.14]Oh my god.
[81:16.41]Everybody settle down, settle down.
[81:19.97]I promise we'll get ice cream after the field trip is over.
[81:32.52]Pick them all up.
[81:34.16]I want ice cream now.
[81:36.96]Well, you can't have it now.
[81:38.94]Sorry.
[81:39.28]Alright, let's keep going.
[81:43.96]I have so many Pikmin.
[81:45.82]Alright, where do we go?
[81:47.66]Get the strawberry.
[81:49.62]Alright, one big guy gets strawberry.
[81:51.08]That should be enough, right?
[81:56.34]How many do I need?
[81:58.92]Send another one.
[81:59.52]No, no, stupid.
[82:03.80]wait oh okay I guess it I guess I have to switch it every time I'm just gonna fit on there more we want more speed go get it over there alright the rest of you follow me I can't go up here where can we go this way
[82:36.78]Ooh, what's this?
[82:37.48]This fight?
[82:45.72]What's going on here?
[82:46.96]Oh, they're picking the fruit.
[82:56.99]Alright, I'm splitting you guys up.
[83:00.99]Go this way.
[83:10.73]1100 bucks.
[83:12.49]Sunseed berry.
[83:15.22]They are yellow.
[83:17.90]Okay.
[83:23.62]10% of debt recovered.
[83:24.96]Oh, nice.
[83:25.85]Just like me.
[83:27.29]I believe I've also recovered 10% of my debt.
[83:32.63]Look, they got little berries.
[83:33.65]Jerry, they got berries.
[83:45.18]Somebody pick one up.
[83:46.26]Pick up the berries.
[83:53.04]Oh, Betty.
[83:56.42]What kind of Betty is this?
[83:59.52]This red Betty contains an ultra spicy essence.
[84:03.84]It does not appear to have any monetary value, but I should research it for use.
[84:06.90]Cool.
[84:09.96]Bring me another one.
[84:10.86]Okay, well, I'll bring you like 10 more.
[84:12.04]I got like 10 on the way.
[84:16.88]I forgot about that word.
[84:18.16]Wait, we can keep getting them?
[84:26.54]Oh, they just kind of respawn.
[84:27.70]Alright.
[84:28.40]I don't know what that does, but whatever.
[84:30.40]Oh, 85.
[84:31.12]Where's the other guys?
[84:32.96]Missing people?
[84:33.36]Alright, into the gate.
[84:39.27]You're wasting time.
[84:41.35]I'm just, look, I'm not going to, this is not going to be an efficient playthrough.
[84:47.42]Captain Olimar, my research on the red berries, sorry, that you discovered has yielded a powerful potion.
[84:54.26]Behold the ultra spicy spray.
[84:57.06]Although it is untested, I believe it will have spectacular results.
[85:01.78]Spray it on all of your Pikmin by pressing two.
[85:06.77]When necessary, I can produce one bottle of spray from 10 berries.
[85:10.19]Press that button to contact me and confirm your berry count by pressing left.
[85:18.31]Should I just do that now?
[85:18.95]Okay.
[85:21.81]What is that thing?
[85:26.49]What?
[85:28.67]Get him.
[85:29.00]Get him.
[85:32.24]Way him down.
[85:35.22]He dropped an egg.
[85:35.76]Alright.
[85:36.02]I want big guys.
[85:36.60]Everyone over here.
[85:43.57]Drink that.
[85:53.15]Can I make a different... I want the purple guy to drink.
[86:03.18]I guess you can't really do that, can you?
[86:04.60]I could split him up.
[86:05.44]Oh, well, I did it.
[86:06.80]No, they got it.
[86:07.20]They got it.
[86:07.78]Good.
[86:07.94]Alright, should I get more berries?
[86:14.49]Separate button.
[86:15.63]Oh, right.
[86:16.23]Shit.
[86:16.45]Okay, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[86:17.65]I'm gonna get some more berries.
[86:39.45]More.
[86:39.71]I have three guys on very duty.
[86:44.68]Need 10, right?
[86:51.24]I hate that so much.
[86:53.64]I'm seriously just pressing down on the D-pad.
[86:57.31]This fucking cheap Wiimote controller.
[87:01.21]They couldn't make it four buttons.
[87:02.19]They had to make it one giant button.
[87:03.63]How dare they?
[87:04.55]And what did this console fucking sell?
[87:05.79]Like 50 million copies?
[87:07.13]Fucking failure.
[87:14.24]100 million consoles sold or something like that?
[87:16.17]Absolute failure.
[87:22.85]Come back here.
[87:25.65]That should be enough, right?
[87:26.41]Maybe one more group.
[87:33.46]How many Wii consoles actually have been sold?
[87:42.23]It was like 50, 60, 100 million something, right?
[87:46.67]What was it?
[87:47.61]No, not 50, 60, 100 million.
[87:48.39]That would be... There's not that many people on Earth.
[87:54.06]101 million.
[87:55.08]Alright, the rest of you just go over here.
[87:57.14]101 million?
[88:04.12]101 million?
[88:13.70]There are way more people on Earth.
[88:17.48]Whatever.
[88:17.78]I'm going to split these guys up.
[88:23.02]Alright.
[88:23.22]You go.
[88:24.74]You stay over here.
[88:25.80]You go get the guys that deliver the berries.
[88:32.58]Bring it back.
[88:36.17]There are more wheeze than people.
[88:38.23]Hold on.
[88:38.91]I need to...
[88:47.05]You know, you know, I wouldn't be surprised if there were more iPhones than people that exist right now.
[88:54.89]And I'm talking all the way through every generation.
[88:59.70]I wouldn't be surprised if in the next few years it was that.
[89:01.92]Come on, get in there.
[89:11.48]Find a spot.
[89:15.77]Sun's going down.
[89:16.33]Hurry up.
[89:22.21]There's an insane amount of e-waste in the world, unfortunately.
[89:25.33]Oh yeah.
[89:26.85]Whatever that is.
[89:28.09]Back up, back up, back up, back up, run away.
[89:30.14]Run, run!
[89:30.74]Oh my god, don't eat him.
[89:32.02]You ate him.
[89:32.44]Alright.
[89:32.62]I don't know how to fight that guy.
[89:44.50]No, I'm trying to hit B. I'm trying to hold B. You have to hold somebody and then hold B. B calls people back.
[89:51.96]Nintendo.
[89:52.48]Nintendo, that was a mistake.
[89:58.36]B calls people back.
[89:59.66]I have to hold A and press B to switch Pikmin.
[90:03.90]Nintendo, this was a mistake.
[90:16.88]What's left?
[90:19.05]Holy shit!
[90:22.59]kill it kill it kill it oh my god we're good we're good we're good this is a dangerous world it's an electric thing I can't I don't go there alright it's almost sundown
[90:52.44]How much time do I have?
[90:54.40]Sun will be setting soon.
[90:55.44]Call all the Pikmin to you.
[90:57.06]This planet's native nocturnal lifeforms are ferocious and therefore dangerous.
[91:05.94]Load your Pikmin into the onion and yourself into my hole so we can take refuge in low orbit.
[91:12.23]Pikmin and your squad will enter the onion on their own at a day's end.
[91:15.45]So call them all to you.
[91:16.57]Oh shit.
[91:21.39]We gotta go.
[91:25.68]There's like a gold coin up there.
[91:29.04]Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.
[91:35.09]Everybody in?
[91:38.97]Quick.
[91:39.17]Get it in. Get it in. Get it in. Get it in. Get it in.
[91:42.27]We're missing somebody.
[91:47.65]We're missing somebody.
[91:48.27]Who are we missing?
[91:50.38]Doesn't matter.
[91:57.24]No, it's over.
[91:57.62]Yeah, go.
[92:01.31]Take out over... No.
[92:02.85]What?
[92:03.07]How do I leave?
[92:03.55]How do I get out of here?
[92:11.29]Worst field trip.
[92:12.57]Check the map.
[92:13.42]What do you mean go back?
[92:14.08]I have five seconds.
[92:17.16]You have time.
[92:19.06]As long as they're in my squad, it doesn't matter, right?
[92:28.84]Shit, they're up there.
[92:31.00]Yes, that doesn't matter as long as they're in the squad.
[92:33.58]Okay.
[92:33.88]I don't think I have time to do this.
[92:46.13]Straight ahead.
[92:49.99]Come on!
[92:52.53]Where are you?
[92:54.51]Where are you?
[93:06.48]We did it.
[93:09.00]We're so concerned about Pikmin.
[93:19.46]Louie's just like picking his nose 200 yards away.
[93:26.41]The alligator just monster comes up from under the ground with mouth open and closes it around him, crushing him.
[93:42.39]I got a bunch of stuff.
[93:43.01]I got a bunch of fruits.
[93:46.57]Best gamer moment.
[93:49.45]No, that... That was a general gamer moment.
[93:56.05]Who died?
[93:59.63]No.
[94:01.95]Eight have died in battle.
[94:04.05]So far.
[94:04.45]Best gamer moment.
[94:13.55]I'm moving my body over here.
[94:14.65]Okay.
[94:36.22]Alright.
[94:37.56]So above ground, there's still things to do on this one.
[94:42.18]Maybe I'll go back to that one.
[94:51.10]This is a new thing.
[94:51.64]Let me see.
[94:53.30]Honeywisp is floating left from Drift's Everglow on the winds.
[94:56.76]Upon death, its physical structure instantly collapses.
[95:03.43]We can simply recover a live sample.
[95:04.99]Research on the spaceship.
[95:08.15]Take it alive?
[95:08.77]How do we do that?
[95:09.51]It's a scary piranha plant thing.
[95:15.92]It has eyes in it.
[95:21.20]Just be careful.
[95:21.78]Watch out for eyes.
[95:22.44]Yep.
[95:24.60]Flowers that have eyeballs in them.
[95:26.14]Be careful.
[95:32.61]Press A. Wait, what?
[95:35.57]What the hell is going on here?
[95:39.17]Why am I throwing carrots?
[95:47.52]Did I hit one in the head?
[96:15.02]I just gave them food for like four years.
[96:16.90]I don't know.
[96:18.00]What am I supposed to do?
[96:25.86]Okay, I don't think that does anything.
[96:28.84]Wait, I can feed carrots to this thing.
[96:39.68]Oh, it's eating the carrots.
[96:47.77]Whoa.
[96:49.29]It didn't like that.
[96:50.19]It doesn't like carrots?
[96:54.71]This thing is terrifying.
[96:56.49]This is like Pan's Labyrinth.
[96:58.87]I don't like this guy.
[97:01.94]What about these guys?
[97:06.80]Do you guys like carrots?
[97:10.85]Yes, we love carrots.
[97:12.14]Okay.
[97:23.38]What about you?
[97:23.92]You guys like carrots?
[97:27.85]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[97:35.05]That's cool.
[97:35.67]It's like a little petting zoo.
[97:42.23]Alright, let's keep going.
[97:48.24]Do I want to go?
[97:48.68]I want to go back here.
[97:50.12]There's still stuff I didn't do here.
[97:53.88]What was it?
[97:54.30]Let's find out.
[97:57.47]No.
[98:00.43]I'll go back.
[98:00.91]Okay.
[98:01.05]Okay.
[98:11.02]Alright, this time I'm going to go... I saw there was a gold coin over here that I want.
[98:13.74]Give me a gold coin.
[98:19.89]I want... 90... 80?
[98:22.57]And then as many of the purples as I can get.
[98:29.41]Actually, I'm making 95, right?
[98:37.94]Yeah.
[98:38.28]Alright, let's do it.
[98:42.20]Don't waste any daylight.
[98:44.34]Forget about that stuff.
[98:45.10]I don't need it right now.
[98:45.74]I want to go over here because there's a gold coin over here.
[98:48.70]There's also this bridge.
[98:51.35]Can they go in the water?
[98:55.79]They die if they go in water?
[98:57.37]Let's test it.
[99:04.07]Yes, they do.
[99:04.53]Okay, come on.
[99:06.01]You're good.
[99:09.90]Okay.
[99:10.70]I can throw them over there though.
[99:13.53]Golden butterflies.
[99:17.85]Get one.
[99:18.20]Get one of those.
[99:22.26]Oh, bring them back.
[99:22.94]Bring them back to the base.
[99:25.88]Nice.
[99:26.56]Alright.
[99:27.74]Come back.
[99:27.98]Come back.
[99:28.19]Come back.
[99:28.57]Come back.
[99:28.99]Come back.
[99:29.23]Come back.
[99:29.47]Come back.
[99:30.91]They alright?
[99:42.67]There's a bunch of nectar over here.
[99:49.24]Alright, they're good.
[99:54.34]How many died?
[99:57.60]Wait, you didn't collect them?
[99:59.08]It's alright, I'm good.
[100:06.91]I got 93.
[100:07.79]Who cares?
[100:10.57]They die if they go in water.
[100:15.15]Alright, well, let's go this way.
[100:16.59]Where can I even go?
[100:17.19]Down this way?
[100:19.31]I'm going to go this way.
[100:23.39]Through here.
[100:30.85]Whoa, there's something munching on those.
[100:34.27]Get it, whatever it is.
[100:38.92]Climb up there and get them.
[100:41.70]Get them.
[100:49.13]Get those little caterpillar guys.
[100:50.53]Get them.
[100:54.67]Get up there.
[101:04.38]Good, good, good, good.
[101:05.26]Drop him.
[101:05.76]Drop him on the ground.
[101:06.48]Get him.
[101:08.72]Nice.
[101:10.18]Alright.
[101:15.04]Bring it back to the base.
[101:21.35]Excuse me.
[101:24.49]Bring it back.
[101:25.01]Is it still alive?
[101:29.65]What's fighting him?
[101:30.35]Is that a bad thing?
[101:38.86]There it is.
[101:39.20]Okay. 200.
[101:54.45]I don't think I have enough.
[101:55.37]180?
[102:01.98]No, I don't.
[102:02.26]Press 2.
[102:02.52]I wonder how, where do they walk this?
[102:20.38]No, I can't.
[102:22.30]2, press 2, 2, 2.
[102:24.28]What, I don't know, what does 2 do?
[102:26.68]Cave to the left.
[102:29.72]Yeah, let's go this way.
[102:31.54]It adds weight?
[102:32.88]Hold on.
[102:33.86]I'm gonna go this way first.
[102:38.82]It's on the globe.
[102:40.60]Why does it look poisonous?
[102:41.48]Come back, come back, come back, come back, come back, come back, come back, come back, come back.
[102:47.98]Is it poisonous?
[102:59.04]Emergency.
[102:59.90]Pikmin are suffering.
[103:00.86]If you blow your whistle with B, you may be able to help them.
[103:04.36]Okay, so I can't touch that.
[103:13.36]Your Pikmin are suffering, Jeremy.
[103:17.18]There's a cave over here.
[103:25.66]Gosh.
[103:30.16]Biological sensors are reacting violently.
[103:32.06]The readings are ominous.
[103:33.02]A beast of unknown power lurks in these depths.
[103:37.48]A large Pikmin group would be reassuring.
[103:41.37]My sound sensors are picking up hostile roars of many beasts.
[103:45.51]Expect dangerous encounters.
[103:49.11]Extreme heat pockets.
[103:50.31]You may need flame resistant Pikmin.
[103:54.67]But my records indicate no such data.
[103:56.43]Are my records incomplete?
[103:59.18]Yeah, I have to assume reds are fire resistant.
[104:06.10]Should I leave the purples?
[104:07.92]I feel like I don't want to bring purples down here.
[104:09.65]Alright, Louie.
[104:15.23]Louie, you stay here with the purples.
[104:19.91]Take them all?
[104:22.46]I'm scared to bring everybody.
[104:33.30]Always take them all.
[104:34.18]Jeremy, you're wicked funny.
[104:42.22]Thanks dude.
[104:48.85]This is how we're going to do this.
[104:50.43]I saw a good.
[104:51.11]It was a good chat message.
[104:54.97]Louie's going to be in charge of purple.
[104:58.12]And Olimar is going to be in charge of red.
[105:00.12]So, we'll be going first.
[105:01.84]We've got a few directions to go.
[105:03.24]How about this way?
[105:11.45]Get over here, Louie.
[105:13.91]Use the purples to fight.
[105:19.15]Get him!
[105:23.74]Get him!
[105:33.14]Yeah, they do like a big ground stomp.
[105:34.88]Alright, pull these guys back.
[105:37.28]Louie, good job, Louie.
[105:39.54]Wait, we got a... Oh, what's this?
[105:41.92]What's this artifact?
[105:43.32]What's this over here?
[105:44.94]Oh, it's a single button?
[105:48.14]D-pad?
[105:49.75]Oh, wow.
[105:50.25]Yeah, they used to use these fucking shitty things back like 5,000 years ago.
[106:05.43]This Dark Souls, that fucking guy.
[106:09.73]Yeah, they used to put all four buttons on this rotating weird axis thing.
[106:14.66]Yeah, yeah, it was really, really interesting.
[106:16.34]I'm saying, yeah, we don't do that anymore.
[106:17.68]Didn't they used to think that you had four humors in your body?
[106:29.03]Yeah, I think that was the same time period.
[106:35.31]Alright, let's keep going.
[106:42.83]Fire, this way.
[106:46.27]Um, one of you take that for research.
[106:50.73]One of you take that for research.
[106:51.77]Did you not listen to me?
[106:53.26]Over here, Louie.
[107:03.96]I love the purples.
[107:04.70]It's so unique.
[107:06.46]It's so cool.
[107:07.34]They have that unique ability.
[107:13.42]Anything down here?
[107:20.55]There's nothing over here, huh?
[107:25.39]Alright, hurry up.

[107:57.90]The noise means you got all the treasures.
[107:59.26]Okay, cool.
[107:59.80]That's good to know.
[108:01.26]What noise?
[108:01.87]Just so I can be aware of it.
[108:14.68]The power down noise?
[108:15.70]Okay.
[108:20.08]Hole of beasts.
[108:26.43]When the Pikmin are singing, it means you have everything.
[108:28.69]Oh, okay.
[108:31.45]So, what's that?
[108:32.29]Let's split it up.
[108:38.06]An egg?
[108:41.86]Pick it up.
[108:42.92]Don't break it.
[108:43.50]Pick it up.
[108:44.30]Why'd you break it?
[108:45.50]Alright, we need the cleanup crew to... Everyone pick up.
[108:52.36]Pick one up.
[108:53.48]Oh, wow.
[109:00.04]Look at all this nectar.
[109:03.39]Everyone's full.
[109:08.03]I have all flower Pikmin, I think.
[109:10.05]Hold on.
[109:10.31]Let me just double check.
[109:15.30]Holy shit.
[109:15.70]I got a whole crew of full flowers.
[109:17.00]Nice.
[109:19.62]Alright.
[109:20.60]That was over there.
[109:21.12]Let's go.
[109:21.66]There's another egg.
[109:32.72]I was expecting spiders.
[109:41.08]Nothing on that side is behind us.
[109:42.47]Alright, let's go deeper.
[109:46.89]Ooh, purple, purple, purple, purple, purple.
[109:50.77]Let's do it.
[110:05.58]Good.
[110:07.94]Now we can go drink the nectar.
[110:10.12]Sick.
[110:12.84]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[110:20.43]Those of you that didn't drink, come over here and drink.
[110:29.47]Slurp it up.
[110:33.75]Alright, one of you didn't get it.
[110:34.67]I think there was one more over here.
[110:36.09]There it is.
[110:39.75]Sing the nectar song.
[110:50.53]Yeah, you guys keep... Every time we raid somebody now, you guys demand a song from them.
[110:58.23]Let me just give you some streamer insight on this.
[111:02.46]If I got raided, and I was in the middle of doing something, if I was, like, let's say I was in the middle of, like, an important match or something, or something really, really I had to pay attention to, and I look over at the chat, and it's like, sing the fucking raid song, and I'm just like, what are you talking about?
[111:18.04]Raid song?
[111:21.94]Too bad, Omega Lo.
[111:28.46]Sing it, sing it.
[111:28.98]And then they have no idea what you're talking about.
[111:32.96]You know, I'm surprised a bunch of you guys don't get banned immediately when we raid.
[111:37.54]Sing the raid song.
[111:38.46]Fucking no.
[111:39.44]Ban all these people.
[111:43.06]I may have.
[111:43.76]I don't stick around for all the raids.
[111:46.28]That may have already happened.
[111:50.20]Ooh, fire.
[111:51.94]Here we go.
[111:58.55]Alright, let's take the fire guys through.
[112:03.67]No, you idiot.
[112:06.21]Okay.
[112:06.49]I can just walk through this.
[112:17.54]Wait, they put it out?
[112:18.20]Oh, they put it out.
[112:20.16]Oh.
[112:28.45]Oh, cool.
[112:38.35]Oh, there's a floppy disk.
[112:44.67]Oh, by the way, somebody linked me.
[112:49.03]I saw on Twitter.
[112:51.25]I was in the Discord talking about Attack on Titan.
[112:55.33]And I said, like, this show sucks and stuff.
[113:01.69]Alright.
[113:02.55]I got to be very clear about this.
[113:05.24]Listen to me.
[113:07.02]I have... I have seen... I am, like, a big fan of that show.
[113:13.93]People were pissed that I didn't... I wrote... What did I write exactly?
[113:17.51]I said... Oh, yeah, I'm 10 episodes into Attack on Titan.
[113:22.83]Oh, I don't get it.
[113:24.05]Like, this show sucks.
[113:25.01]Why are they Titans?
[113:25.82]Like, stupidest fucking show or something, right?
[113:30.63]I don't think people know that I've seen every fucking season.
[113:34.05]I'm like a big fan of the show.
[113:36.26]It just was bait, yeah.
[113:39.66]And people thought I was really stupid.
[113:41.02]They're just like, wait, have you seen Tenet?
[113:44.42]No, of course he doesn't like it.
[113:46.68]His brain is too small.
[113:59.92]anime fans juve yeah it was give me this floppy disk there's also some of you guys miss out on some random in general chat stuff that I do a few weeks ago I was in the general chat it was like maybe three or four o'clock in the morning pacific
[114:22.33]And I wrote a bunch of stuff and nobody responded.
[114:24.59]There was maybe like one person that was there.
[114:27.21]I just wrote a bunch of shit and nobody responded.
[114:30.01]And I wrote like, what the fuck?
[114:31.25]No one's talking.
[114:31.95]Like, what the fuck is this bullshit?
[114:35.41]And nobody said anything.
[114:39.94]I think like maybe two people did like minutes or hours later or something.
[114:45.82]It's 3 a.m.
[114:48.64]I think I got everything right.
[114:49.38]Are they singing?
[114:49.86]So that means I did it.
[114:54.45]Right?
[114:55.59]I'm good, right?
[114:59.09]Yeah.
[115:03.51]I have to be careful because I just write, I just say and write random things that don't mean anything.
[115:12.25]And sometimes I feel like people might see that and out of context might go like, wow, he's like a fucking asshole.
[115:19.52]Oh, well.
[115:29.51]Oh, we got a big Bunger over there.
[115:35.13]Wait, let's check back here.
[115:36.95]Nothing.
[115:37.23]Alright, we gotta, we gotta split this up.
[115:45.38]Uh, Olimar.
[115:47.80]Too many.
[115:48.34]No, no, no, too many.
[115:49.14]No.
[115:52.65]Just...
[116:01.77]Wake up!
[116:02.21]Okay, now I want Olimar.
[116:09.51]No, get out of here!
[116:17.16]I fucking hate this controller.
[116:27.45]This thing was meant to be shook around, not press any of these buttons.
[116:35.01]Very nice, very nice.
[116:43.44]Who is an egg?
[116:44.94]I'm not going to break that yet.
[116:45.82]Let's go kill the big guy.
[116:47.94]Alright, let's get this set up.
[116:53.64]Doing my RTS setup.
[116:55.97]Jerma's not a gamer.
[116:56.99]I mean, maybe a little.
[117:06.91]In three, two... Holy shit.
[117:12.62]I got him instantly.
[117:13.36]Oh, it's a gaming watch.
[117:15.54]Cool.
[117:16.78]Oh, there's more over there.
[117:26.39]What's in here?
[117:29.65]Oh, it's a flower.
[117:30.55]Nice.
[117:30.83]Alright, get the... I love aces.
[117:32.93]I love cards.
[117:34.21]I'm a huge card fan.
[117:39.20]Put a 10 on there.
[117:40.28]You know what I mean?
[117:42.44]Drop a Jack on top of that.
[117:43.34]You know what I'm saying?
[117:47.70]I'm sorry.
[117:47.98]Alright.
[117:49.92]I need... We're going to put some more of these guys in here.
[118:02.16]Yeah.
[118:03.71]More purples.
[118:11.82]The Ace of Spades.
[118:15.73]Worth $140.
[118:19.87]Luck wafer.
[118:20.61]That's cute.
[118:24.13]It's very cute.
[118:28.76]David Spade.
[118:29.50]Let's go crack that egg so we can get some nectar.
[118:39.26]Who has not drank nectar?
[118:40.68]Which one of you?
[118:44.45]Where's that egg?
[118:44.83]Over here?
[118:45.17]What's that sound?
[118:50.73]It was an egg.
[118:51.15]Where's the egg?
[118:53.63]What?
[118:59.36]Fight!
[119:04.56]Okay, well... They stole it?
[119:14.62]Oh, there it is.
[119:20.74]And... Alright, get in there.
[119:22.74]Who hasn't drank, drink it.
[119:41.93]One person hasn't... Oh, two actually.
[119:47.05]Nice.
[119:53.13]Break it.
[119:59.22]Very good.
[120:00.60]We can keep going.
[120:11.43]I demand heal.
[120:14.66]Oh, no.
[120:16.36]I misread what you said.
[120:17.20]This one's deep.
[120:20.80]Actually, I could go for one right now.
[120:22.09]I'm not even kidding.
[120:24.39]I might go get one.
[120:26.79]Final floor.
[120:27.39]Alright, this is important.
[120:28.13]I think this is the first real test.
[120:34.05]What is that thing?
[120:36.35]It's a giant cat.
[120:37.07]Can I take a picture of it and upload it and get data on it?
[120:38.93]That's huge.
[120:42.07]Oh, boy.
[120:42.91]Um...
[120:45.68]I feel like I'm going to do this in two parts here.
[120:59.65]Alright.
[121:01.29]It's time.
[121:05.79]How do we go about doing this?
[121:11.47]Spray everybody first.
[121:12.51]Alright, so hit two and then I'm going in.
[121:15.58]Spray.
[121:25.24]Astounding.
[121:25.96]The heads of the Pikmin are glowing and they seem extremely agitated.
[121:31.08]The ultra spicy spray appears to increase Pikmin speed and attack power.
[121:34.38]Oh man.
[121:34.84]Okay.
[121:38.51]Do that again over here.
[121:42.49]What?
[121:43.99]What?
[121:45.33]Why did... Alright, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[121:49.60]How long?
[121:50.02]Is it temporary?
[121:51.80]Get in there.
[121:52.16]Just kill him.
[121:58.54]Where's the other pig?
[122:02.52]Oh, my God.
[122:02.98]He's going to roll over everybody.
[122:06.24]Did he kill everyone?
[122:07.12]Oh, my God.
[122:14.10]He killed every purple.
[122:17.86]Come back, come back, come back, come back.
[122:19.14]Oh my god.
[122:19.64]I didn't know he did that.
[122:20.46]He killed every purple.
[122:21.86]Oh no.
[122:25.16]No.
[122:25.60]Get on his head.
[122:27.75]God damn it, man.
[122:32.11]Come back, come back, come back.
[122:32.89]Pull back.
[122:34.49]I've... I've... What the hell?
[122:36.85]I feel like shit now.
[122:38.03]Every purple's dead.
[122:38.87]Oh my god.
[122:47.97]How bizarre.
[122:48.41]This device is emitting black light.
[122:49.85]It must have been ingested by that creature.
[122:54.17]What an absolutely repulsive life form.
[122:57.27]Did I get soft locked?
[123:03.08]Reload.
[123:03.52]Can I?
[123:10.92]No, I can't.
[123:14.00]No reload.
[123:14.74]No.
[123:15.74]Oh.
[123:18.11]Every single purple is dead.
[123:23.07]Every single one.
[123:28.45]That's so sad.
[123:29.32]That's so sad.
[123:33.40]Why couldn't it have been the red ones?
[123:40.30]I can get them back.
[123:41.14]Yeah, I know.
[123:41.97]But it's still sad.
[123:45.54]I'm glad I have enough to actually lift this.
[124:06.78]200.
[124:08.28]Just reload the floor.
[124:10.22]No, I... No, I have to live with consequences.
[124:14.83]I can't be a Dave State every single game I play.
[124:22.19]This contraption seems to react when it approaches treasure.
[124:24.58]I will connect it to my radar.
[124:29.12]Oh, it like beeps.
[124:34.02]The treasure gauge is now fully operational.
[124:36.32]20 purples died.
[124:38.60]I know.
[124:41.81]That sucks.
[124:43.69]Please restart.
[124:44.57]No, come on.
[124:55.25]You need them.
[124:55.92]Restart.
[125:01.26]No, I'm not restarting.
[125:03.20]I have to deal with the consequences.
[125:04.30]Is that it?
[125:13.21]You wasted three gas.
[125:14.51]Yeah, but I can go get that gas back.
[125:29.22]That was a lot of money.
[125:31.12]That's over a thousand dollars.
[125:32.98]38 people died.
[125:33.72]God.
[125:33.94]That's unfortunate.
[125:39.58]Farm more at the caves first.
[125:42.52]Hmm.
[125:51.60]Do some farming.
[125:52.66]Alright, I'm getting a heal.
[126:03.01]Let's take a break.
[126:03.45]I'm going to go pee.
[126:05.25]I'll be right back.
[126:06.25]BRB?
[126:19.63]Thanks for watching!
[130:11.05]It's actually kind of funny.
[130:12.67]Whenever a Catboy image comes up, I get to kind of watch the PUBG blue thing start to be right behind some of you guys.
[130:28.22]All of a sudden, it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[130:31.25]What's that?
[130:32.57]Run!
[130:34.51]Run!
[130:44.99]the zone yeah just wait till I actually put the costume on you just you wait till I turn the camera on one day and I'm in like full cat boy
[131:20.56]Please don't.
[131:25.70]Here's the thing.
[131:26.26]I think I've said this already, but I'll say it again.
[131:28.74]That stream is going to be the most unfollowed and followed stream I've ever done on Twitch.
[131:41.18]Let's just be clear about that.
[131:55.43]Alright, let's get back.
[131:56.99]I got my Huel.
[131:58.07]Oh, and it's delicious, and it's giving me tons of recharging fuel.
[132:11.59]What, the Huel flavor?
[132:13.31]I mean, there's three flavors, and I'll give you the rundown.
[132:17.16]There's a chocolate, there's a berry, and there's a vanilla.
[132:21.47]The chocolate one, I think tastes the best, but I think it's a little too thick.
[132:27.29]It's very milkshake-y.
[132:30.03]It tastes good, but I'm not a big fan of that.
[132:32.57]The vanilla tastes very good, but it has a weird texture to it.
[132:38.16]It has a texture that I'm not a fan of.
[132:40.38]And I don't know why, I can just tell.
[132:42.75]The berry, though, it's smooth.
[132:45.75]It's got a good flavor.
[132:47.25]It tastes kind of like a strawberry yogurt drink.
[132:50.53]And I would say that's my favorite one.
[132:52.76]And there's no soy in it.
[132:53.76]The person that just said that timed them out for a minute.
[132:57.48]This is a non-soy product.
[133:03.83]Anyways, let's play Pikmin.
[133:11.55]Alright, what are we doing?
[133:12.49]Oh, yeah.
[133:12.97]A bunch of purple Pikmin died.
[133:14.71]Hold on.
[133:17.48]Heal's in the way of this Wii sensor.
[133:19.38]There we go.
[133:23.75]Alright, so let's pull up these, uh...
[133:35.41]So I need purples.
[133:36.89]I can't believe I have no purples.
[133:38.85]Alright, where do I want to go?
[133:40.03]The treasure meter is blinking.
[133:41.57]Let's go this way.
[133:45.51]I need water Pikmin.
[133:47.99]That's definitely what that is.
[133:50.87]We can't go that way.
[133:51.82]Oh, berries.
[133:52.74]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[133:53.36]Let's do some berry farming.
[133:56.68]Berry farming it is.
[133:57.42]Guys, there's no fucking way that the dev is in the chat.
[134:06.71]No, no, that is impossible.
[134:08.07]You're right.
[134:20.22]Who even made this game?
[134:21.26]I know it was Nintendo, but what studio?
[134:32.36]Of course.
[134:39.60]Was it just like a... What first party or whatever Nintendo studio?
[134:43.35]This is a Miyamoto game.
[134:45.53]Is it really?
[134:46.01]Wait, Miyamoto made this?
[134:51.52]What?
[134:57.16]Yes.
[135:00.39]Is there anything that he can't do?
[135:08.77]So anything that that man couldn't do.
[135:16.40]Honestly, if you told me like, oh yeah, Miyamoto like flew overhead with like a Superman cape on and he can shoot lasers out of his eyes.
[135:22.00]I'd be like, yeah, I'm sure that would not surprise me.
[135:25.36]I'd be like, oh yeah, that makes sense.
[135:31.88]I want that.
[135:34.12]Sacrifice somebody.
[135:34.78]I want to see what it costs.
[135:38.71]Nevermind.
[135:42.91]There is a gate up here.
[135:43.73]There's an electricity gate.
[135:45.77]I can't get that.
[135:47.41]I can't even get up there.
[135:48.13]I have to get rid of this thing.
[135:51.88]This is 200.
[135:55.88]Shit.
[135:59.54]What can I even do here?
[136:01.14]This has got poison gas on it.
[136:05.04]What's the play?
[136:06.86]I have to go farm purples in the cave.
[136:15.01]Okay.
[136:20.10]Do I have to do this like three or four times?
[136:27.96]You should have reset.
[136:32.44]But, I mean, I can't just... Look, we can't rely on everything to just restart a game save.
[136:36.56]God damn it.
[136:38.93]I'm actually going to try heal because of you.
[136:43.85]Don't be angry about it.
[136:45.15]Don't be upset about it.
[136:51.50]Don't be mad about it.
[136:53.34]You don't have to do anything.
[136:59.48]I'm not making you do that.
[137:05.09]It's the next level, right?
[137:10.73]I don't even want these things.
[137:12.63]Let's go.
[137:17.90]Megalull, it's working.
[137:19.12]Fuck you, I'm doing it.
[137:21.62]Influencer Andy.
[137:23.48]You're abusing your reach to malnourish children.
[137:28.11]Um.
[137:30.67]I'm going to tell, I mean, let me tell you something.
[137:33.17]That person that just said that, you must have not done any research on the product at all.
[137:44.03]400 calories.
[137:44.59]20 grams of protein.
[137:46.23]No soy.
[137:47.16]I'll read it again.
[137:47.66]I don't even care.
[137:48.30]No one's paying me to do this.
[137:49.58]I don't care.
[137:50.34]These things help me a lot.
[137:51.24]I swear to God.
[137:54.94]That's a true story.
[137:55.62]Hold on.
[138:01.85]Let me get this.
[138:10.95]Alright, here we go.
[138:12.65]I'm just going to keep doing this and reload.
[138:19.76]No, I'm going to give you the real, real honest to God reason why I got these in the first place.
[138:25.74]And you can be your own judge.
[138:26.62]How's that?
[138:26.88]Those of you who know, like a year ago, I was having a lot of pain.
[138:33.15]And I still kind of am.
[138:34.77]But, you know, I'm still working on it.
[138:37.97]Anyways, I lost like 25 pounds.
[138:44.36]I was like 133 pounds like a year ago.
[138:48.12]I don't know if it's a combination of stress or annoyance or hard to be.
[138:56.04]I don't know.
[138:57.54]I thought my diet was okay.
[139:00.40]That was also part of the reason why we kind of talked about with the doctor.
[139:02.70]Like, hey, am I losing weight?
[139:04.69]What the fuck's wrong with me?
[139:06.69]So I decided I looked at a few different companies.
[139:10.20]I was like, uh, maybe I can, like, supplement this and, like, help with, like, maybe trying to maintain some weight or put a little bit of weight on, whatever.
[139:20.83]Uh, and I got these.
[139:22.99]And... This is... For me, this is... I'm not replacing food.
[139:27.95]This is, like, I'm just adding some of this.
[139:29.47]You know what I'm saying?
[139:32.80]Wait, is that more?
[139:33.30]So, I didn't get these to, like, oh, I'm only gonna drink this, like, fucking product and that's the only food I'll eat.
[139:40.58]I would drink one like in the morning and maybe drink one at night.
[139:44.83]I am 152 pounds now.
[139:47.57]I gained a lot of weight.
[139:49.17]I feel a little healthier.
[139:51.36]Diet got a little better.
[139:52.08]You know what I'm saying?
[139:58.19]Now, look, I'm not going to tell you that I'm going to attribute it all to doing that.
[140:02.53]You know what, guys?
[140:05.19]I drank Huel and weirdly enough, I was like 10 times stronger.
[140:10.60]I became a fucking superhero.
[140:12.06]No.
[140:13.62]But it absolutely did help me in my particular case of trying to put on some weight when I was having trouble.
[140:23.26]So there you go.
[140:24.76]There's the true story.
[140:28.94]And even though I'm still... I don't want to get any heavier than 152.
[140:32.46]155 is kind of where I start to draw the line there.
[140:40.25]But I like them.
[140:42.49]It's nice.
[140:43.25]I don't drink them every day anymore.
[140:48.11]Maybe during a stream.
[140:49.13]That's a really good stream snack too.
[140:52.72]Because it's just right there.
[140:53.66]I can just sip on it.
[140:54.34]It's really good.
[140:56.66]So I just kept it going.
[141:05.04]pump iron on alright can I leave and just can I get out of here give up an escape can I just leave and then come back in or is this gonna be bad that was a Ted Talk there's another purple oh there is another purple flower that's right or is it
[141:37.91]Does it taste good?
[141:39.35]Yes.
[141:40.69]Otherwise, I wouldn't drink it.
[141:41.56]I am very picky with what I eat.
[141:45.50]I'm serious.
[141:47.52]That's why I just told you.
[141:49.96]The chocolate one probably tastes the best, but it's too thick for me to drink it.
[141:54.95]It's a little too thick.
[141:56.11]It's the thickest of the three of them.
[141:59.07]The berry one is probably the lightest.
[142:05.98]If that's what you want, if you're like, you know what?
[142:08.32]I don't care if it's a little thicker.
[142:09.46]I want the chocolate.
[142:11.17]Then you'll like it.
[142:12.07]I think that's probably the one that tastes the best.
[142:18.21]What's this flower?
[142:18.73]Is it one more floor down?
[142:24.71]Can you buy it in store or is it online?
[142:31.30]I actually don't know.
[142:35.53]I think it's mainly online.
[142:37.85]I think that you might be able to get it in some stores.
[142:41.41]I don't really know.
[142:45.13]Nobody said that yet.
[142:46.03]Why would I read that out loud if nobody said that?
[142:52.74]Does it just appear in your fridge?
[142:58.76]I have everybody, right?
[143:02.60]Yeah, you can order it online.
[143:11.41]You gotta go to your heal dealer.
[143:12.91]What is it, a car?
[143:13.77]The infinite heal fridge.
[143:27.55]Get a heal branded fridge.
[143:32.85]No, I can't.
[143:37.52]I'm not doing that.
[143:47.68]After I get another 10 or so, that should be good, right?
[143:51.32]Where's that flower?
[143:58.19]Where is it?
[143:59.19]I know it's in here.
[143:59.69]I don't have to wake him up.
[144:12.44]Nobody make any noise.
[144:14.40]Oh God!
[144:15.18]Fight him!
[144:15.82]Fight him!
[144:16.42]Fight him!
[144:17.04]Fight him!
[144:17.70]Fight him!
[144:18.32]Fight him!
[144:18.94]Fight him!
[144:19.32]We're good.
[144:32.11]Alright.
[144:36.25]I think we got enough.
[144:36.97]That should be what?
[144:37.59]10? 15?
[144:48.86]Yule flower.
[144:54.64]Actually, no, no, no.
[144:55.28]Nobody don't do this yet.
[144:56.24]I got to clear this out.
[144:56.92]Did you hear what I said?
[145:00.29]I said stop doing that.
[145:04.07]I'm trying to just... I don't want to have them walk through this and get burned.
[145:07.87]Okay, thank you.
[145:22.76]Have you ever thought about how mirrors are some insane alien sci-fi technology and yet we just have them and everyone acts like they're normal?
[145:30.09]What?
[145:35.57]You know, it's funny you say that and not cellular data technology.
[145:42.04]It's the mirroring.
[145:44.44]We're worried about mirrors.
[145:47.88]And not about how a Wi-Fi signal travels.
[145:58.36]That's pretty ridiculous.
[146:03.11]The fact that information can travel through the air, I think is way more alien technology, like, holy shit, bro, than a mirror.
[146:21.90]But mirrors, mirrors are really kind of weird too, though.
[146:30.11]But I guess the way you can describe a mirror, I mean, it's just, it's just really shiny.
[146:35.22]It's shiny to the point that you can see a reflection in the shininess.
[146:39.48]So it's not that really that weird.
[146:41.08]It's just, it's so it's too shiny.
[146:56.33]It's reflecting.
[146:57.35]It's very reflective.
[146:58.39]It reflects too much.
[147:02.58]By the way, um, you want to know something that'll freak you out?
[147:06.06]This is something that a lot of people don't understand.
[147:08.88]And this is, uh, I'm going to really turn a lot of you guys world upside down with this one.
[147:14.26]So when you look in a mirror, you're not actually looking at what you actually look like.
[147:20.05]You ever put up a cell phone to your face and you go, why do I look so fucking weird?
[147:25.34]It's because you are flipped.
[147:26.98]When you are looking into a mirror, you're flipped.
[147:29.94]And if you have even a slightly asymmetrical face at all, if you don't look in a mirror, you think that you look crazy.
[147:38.91]You guys ever do that?
[148:01.91]I'm not ugly.
[148:02.97]Hold on, wait.
[148:07.68]No, I don't want to fight this thing again.
[148:10.26]I need to go back.
[148:10.84]How do I get out of here?
[148:14.48]That was... That was... Ah, it was.
[148:17.54]That was like watch mojo type of like information.
[148:21.35]Mirrors, what's going on there?
[148:23.09]Did you know that your cell phone reflects you sideways and flips you around?
[148:26.87]Insane.
[148:27.77]Ridiculous.
[148:32.15]Top 10 things that people might not have known about objects in their house.
[148:36.25]Mirror.
[148:37.31]Mirrors reflect light sideways and flips your... Whatever, I don't care.
[148:41.62]And look, you want... Okay, fine.
[148:43.60]WatchMojo has like 600 million subscribers.
[148:47.12]So somebody's fucking listening to that and somebody cares.
[148:53.62]So what I said was information that was cool and it was like... Who'd have thought?
[148:57.41]Info.
[148:58.45]Run past him?
[148:59.23]Oh, okay.
[148:59.49]Okay.
[149:04.68]It's you.
[149:10.43]Oh yeah?
[149:11.53]How about this one, all you intellectuals?
[149:14.85]If you take a mirror, a small one, and you hold it up on your chin so the mirror is flat going forward from your chin, if you put your chin down and hold it flat against your chin and look down and walk around your house, you're walking on the fucking ceiling.
[149:32.37]It's so cool.
[149:33.53]Just be careful you don't trip over anything in real life.
[149:54.47]I think he's sick.
[150:02.18]Attack on Titans sucks.
[150:03.70]Alright, I got my Pikmin.
[150:08.66]Should I get some more?
[150:16.18]That is really fun to do though.
[150:17.10]And by the way, all you guys making fun of me for saying that I'll put the mirror up to the tip of your chin and look down and lay it flat and walk.
[150:25.08]I got that from Nickelodeon magazine in like 1993.
[150:28.98]So, and that shit was awesome.
[150:32.31]So don't you come after me.
[150:35.69]Wait, what's over here?
[150:44.45]What is this?
[150:44.87]Is it flowers?
[150:46.39]There's a treasure over here.
[150:51.10]Where is it?
[150:57.42]Get this guy.
[151:04.94]Kill him.
[151:06.26]Alright, we got it.
[151:12.90]There's something still over here.
[151:16.72]I'm so confused.
[151:17.25]What is over here?
[151:18.85]Is it?
[151:19.21]Oh, it's these.
[151:19.71]Alright.
[151:22.51]I'm going to go back to the, uh, can I weigh that thing down yet or no?
[151:27.45]It was a beetle up there.
[151:28.22]It was a beetle.
[151:39.11]Beetle.
[151:42.03]I saw it too.
[151:45.00]This berry treasure, you need another Pikmin Elm.
[151:46.82]Alright, let's just keep going.
[151:53.66]What do I need to weigh that down?
[151:59.60]If I use the spray, will it make them weigh heavier?

[160:18.26]Put your mic in your ass so we can tell if you're farting or not.
[160:21.24]I read... That's a real one I read.
[160:23.96]Put a mic onto your, like, asshole so we can be sure you're not farting.
[160:28.36]That's what I have to read over here.
[160:34.95]That's what I have to read.
[160:51.04]Mythbusters.
[160:52.46]Mythbusters.
[160:53.10]What was that?
[160:57.08]Astounding.
[160:57.50]My metal detectors are reacting violently.
[160:59.20]What could be down below?
[161:00.04]No.
[161:00.10]If you find trouble below, press that.
[161:05.00]Yes, yes, yes.
[161:07.28]Mm-hmm.
[161:19.98]What's down here?
[161:20.56]This is gas and fire.
[161:21.96]No, I said my piece.
[161:27.85]It really helped me a lot.
[161:29.07]All jokes aside.
[161:31.11]It did a lot of good for me.
[161:32.45]It really did.
[161:33.45]That's the honest to God truth.
[161:37.77]Ooh, this is cool looking.
[161:50.52]Watch out!
[161:54.06]Alright, now pick it up and bring it back to the ship.
[161:58.12]Consume its blood.
[162:02.90]How many calories are in one?
[162:03.90]400.
[162:03.92]400 calories and you don't... What was that?
[162:27.93]That's oh you somebody brought up somebody said to talk about sugar it's five grams of sugar in the bottle Or in one serving if you get like a powder Only five grams of sugar Some of you guys are drinking like a fucking Mountain Dew right now, and it's like 40 So just to let you know
[162:59.59]Mountain Dew is 60 what?
[163:02.35]No, it's not.
[163:04.61]What?
[163:07.51]Mountain Dew is 63 grams of sugar in a bottle?
[163:11.10]In just a, like a 16 ounce bottle?
[163:13.50]No, it's not.
[163:14.06]I thought it was like 39 or like 43 or something.
[163:20.08]It's 63 grams of sugar.
[163:21.81]That's un-fucking-believable.
[163:26.28]Coke is, what, 38, 37?
[163:27.62]What?
[163:29.00]Why is it that much?
[163:38.99]Okay, is it my opinion that once you cross a certain threshold of sugar in a drink, you can't even tell it's in there anymore?
[163:47.80]After, like, 30 to 40 grams of sugar, can you even tell that it's 60 instead of 40?
[163:54.38]I can't.
[163:58.96]It's 46.
[164:04.30]I have an experiment for all you to do.
[164:05.64]If you drink coffee and you put, you know, milk or cream and sugar in your coffee or something.
[164:09.88]If you get just a regular from, I'm going to use Dunkin' Donuts as an example, right?
[164:13.96]Or even Starbucks, whatever.
[164:14.78]Doesn't matter.
[164:16.20]Just getting a normal, just with cream and sugar at any of this, one of these random places that just, a big coffee shop.
[164:23.54]Start doing half sugar.
[164:25.96]Be like, okay, yeah, I'll take a regular iced coffee, but can you do a half the sugar you put in?
[164:31.93]I bet you, you won't even tell the difference.
[164:35.44]From 50% to 100%.
[164:38.16]I started doing that and I couldn't tell.
[164:39.68]I actually could not tell the difference.
[164:48.77]And what you're doing is you are reducing the amount of sugar you're taking in every day.
[164:53.63]Which, let's be honest, is really not that great for you.
[164:55.83]It really isn't.
[164:58.17]You can't even tell it.
[165:15.31]It's based and healthy.
[165:19.33]They're ignoring you and putting in regular sugar.
[165:21.37]No, they're not.
[165:26.73]It's just, they just didn't even change it.
[165:30.95]Yeah.
[165:31.13]Okay.
[165:31.61]Half sugar.
[165:32.57]Okay.
[165:33.45]Nope.
[165:34.01]Not doing that.
[165:34.59]That's no, that's not true.
[165:37.88]I've seen people make the coffee.
[165:40.76]Holy shit.
[165:41.38]That's fire.
[165:44.96]And instead of going like, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, with like a sugar, it's one, two, done.
[165:54.48]I've seen him do it.
[166:03.65]Oh, they have the pumps, right?
[166:04.61]That's a lot of places that have pumps.
[166:06.13]And they take your coffee over.
[166:08.07]And they go... Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[166:15.18]Too much.
[166:15.94]Way too much.
[166:20.90]You can specifically ask for, like, one pump.
[166:23.84]Or, like, two pumps.
[166:25.34]Start doing that.
[166:25.88]I'm serious.
[166:34.63]I want fire only.
[166:36.80]Get him.
[166:46.54]Get in there.
[166:49.46]You can't hurt him there.
[166:50.22]Fire.
[166:55.86]A generous 12 pumps.
[166:58.96]And I have another thing to tell you.
[167:01.17]Oh, he's got more to tell us.
[167:02.69]Oh, okay.
[167:03.11]Everybody watch out.
[167:06.46]That's a diamond over there.
[167:09.64]If you are asking for extra cream and extra sugar in your coffee, you're eating a cake.
[167:16.31]Just go eat a cake.
[167:17.97]Go order a cake at a bakery and eat the cake.
[167:27.25]Cut back.
[167:27.83]Cut back on that.
[167:29.23]That's a lot.
[167:30.57]Extra cream, extra sugar is just a cookie.
[167:32.39]You're just drinking a cookie.
[167:35.55]Not worse than that.
[167:37.65]I wonder what like extra cream, extra sugar at like a Starbucks or a Dunkin Donuts.
[167:41.13]I wonder what that actually is.
[167:42.99]What is it?
[167:43.25]Well, how much is, what does, what is the actual, um, like milliliters of cream and sugar and stuff?
[167:55.38]And then how much like cream and sugar goes into baking a whole cake?
[168:00.62]I'm interested to know.
[168:02.60]Can they get this?
[168:09.54]I can't get that.
[168:12.04]Can't get it?
[168:12.44]Is he dead?
[168:23.55]Can they get it?
[168:26.03]Sacrificing five reds.
[168:27.93]Where are they walking at?
[168:31.17]They got it.
[168:34.90]They got it.
[168:35.26]They got it.
[168:35.50]They got it.
[168:40.68]Love this frame.
[168:41.20]Have you ever wanted... ...a way to drink?
[168:46.51]Well, that's not even real.
[168:47.73]I'm making that up.
[168:56.93]Alright, no more.
[168:57.57]I got it.
[169:02.35]Is there any more layers?
[169:03.84]Yes!
[169:07.88]There's a customer that my friend works at Starbucks and somebody comes in and gets seven shots of espresso and extra sugar.
[169:17.88]What?
[169:18.72]That's a lot.
[169:24.93]Is that person?
[169:26.11]I feel like that's like the joke drink that the Incredible Hulk drinks in one of the last movies or something.
[169:41.54]Eight shots of espresso with extra sugar.
[169:44.64]And it's tiny in his hand and you're like... It was light.
[169:58.95]Ooh, different flower.
[170:00.47]Cool.
[170:02.77]I get seven shots of espresso?
[170:07.94]One shot of espresso is one coffee, right?
[170:12.86]So therefore, you're essentially drinking seven coffees.
[170:14.68]That's a lot.
[170:18.92]No?
[170:19.34]It's less?
[170:20.72]Is it more?
[170:21.98]One shot of espresso is two.
[170:24.64]It's one to two.
[170:27.67]Well, I'm talking about the caffeine count.
[170:30.83]One shot of espresso is about one to two cups of coffee.
[170:34.65]Two shot is a medium coffee. ...
[170:45.34]Like six coffees for seven shots of espresso.
[170:49.54]Jesus.
[170:51.56]Did you hear that sound come out of my mouth?
[170:53.31]It was like... The Pikmin look as if they are long to be tossed into the flower.
[171:04.81]Well, let's... I don't want to do it to purple.
[171:10.57]Is white electricity?
[171:15.13]We'll find out.
[171:19.33]Or water?
[171:24.54]No.
[171:33.54]Why does poison?
[171:34.70]Oh, so the gas.
[171:35.58]OK, cool.
[171:39.08]Get in there.
[171:51.38]Hmm.
[172:01.02]Incredible.
[172:02.70]A white Pikmin.
[172:04.14]It's tiny, but it looks distinctly swift.
[172:06.22]Its eyes are an unseemly red.
[172:08.08]This type of Pikmin was not mentioned in your notes, Olimar.
[172:12.64]It must be an entirely new type of Pikmin.
[172:16.36]A data record on this type is a blank page since a certain captain never documented them.
[172:23.09]You must experiment and make detailed observations for the benefit of future generations.
[172:27.00]It's a mega LOL Reddit.
[172:29.68]Kind of is the Reddit Pikmin, isn't it?
[172:38.15]Oh, why can I not... Um... Go in?
[172:44.67]Go in?
[172:54.64]I just put three... It was a waste?
[173:10.37]No, it wasn't.
[173:14.97]Louie, get up here and help me pull these.
[173:27.85]Just replants them.
[173:31.63]Oh, well, I got 15.
[173:35.43]Okay, let's get back to the group.
[173:39.03]Something in here.
[173:45.33]What is in here?
[173:48.55]What is it now?
[173:51.31]Perfect.
[173:55.09]Ooh, it's dinging.
[174:03.19]Hey.
[174:03.99]Amazing.
[174:06.33]The white Pikmin have unearthed a treasure that was completely buried in the ground.
[174:11.73]Hmm.
[174:14.19]Perhaps those beady red eyes are there to allow them to sense objects buried in the dirt.
[174:19.28]Hooray!
[174:38.22]Alright, this is a joke how thick this is.
[174:45.78]Everybody get on it.
[174:48.24]We'll keep looking.
[174:55.81]Ooh!
[174:56.65]Drink up!
[175:04.45]No, no, no, don't all, only red Pikmin just rank that.
[175:08.55]You have to share it with everybody else.
[175:23.10]Share it.
[175:24.16]Share it with everybody else.
[175:25.27]What the hell?
[175:30.51]Greedy.
[175:33.21]Too greedy.
[175:41.23]80 dollars.
[175:43.57]Super stick textile.
[175:47.09]Cool.
[175:47.87]I like it.
[175:52.11]That's it for this floor.
[175:56.04]Let's get everybody else.
[176:04.42]Follow me.
[176:05.52]We got the whole crew.
[176:10.03]All aboard!
[176:18.98]The whole Dru crew?
[176:21.18]That's right.
[176:21.74]That's you guys.
[176:23.87]You are the Dru crew.
[176:38.72]Was it February?
[176:43.56]Alright, so in June, I don't have to say that anymore.
[176:50.53]Well, here's the gas part.
[176:51.95]Oh shit, everybody split up.
[176:59.53]Remove the gas.
[177:03.62]Are they fighting?
[177:06.62]What are they fighting?
[177:11.14]Oh, they're fighting the gas.
[177:15.37]We'll pick that up.
[177:15.95]Did they not carry that?
[177:17.73]Is a white Pikmin not picking anything up?
[177:34.69]I can't take this with me for research?
[177:44.88]It's a pipe and I can't like rip it out and take it with me.
[177:48.33]Alright, let's go.
[178:00.55]Oh wait, that's.
[178:13.14]And why do it one behind me doesn't even wait?
[178:14.88]Can I get the mushroom?
[178:19.98]Easy.
[178:21.32]Easy, don't go that way.
[178:26.46]I'm gonna be safe.
[178:32.50]I can get the mushroom cool.
[178:33.22]And everybody.
[178:45.38]Yeah, they can get the mushroom.
[178:51.42]Bring it in.
[179:04.45]This is hey Jerma.
[179:05.01]It's my birthday today.
[179:05.81]This is Enver.
[179:07.81]It's my birthday.
[179:08.29]Could you be really rude to me for five minutes?
[179:14.16]Happy birthday.
[179:16.68]I'm going to be really rude to you.
[179:18.12]Why would I be rude to you on your birthday?
[179:21.02]Doesn't sound fun.
[179:27.40]Oh, treasure.
[179:32.38]Can I get up there?
[179:35.82]Alright, now walk that way.
[179:45.10]Get it.
[180:00.59]How do I get up there?

[180:25.79]I get it.
[180:32.64]Get it.
[180:35.14]Careful.
[180:43.73]Deliver that.
[180:44.65]Somebody help him.
[180:46.37]No fall damage?
[180:55.32]Yeah, that's good.
[180:57.22]Cool.
[181:00.83]You don't need to take all the Pikmin to the entrance of the next geyser.
[181:03.34]They follow you if you enter as a captain, even if they're not in your party.
[181:06.24]Really?
[181:06.50]Okay, that's good to know.
[181:08.64]Do you have Pikmin impressions?
[181:10.02]Sure, okay.
[181:21.39]Uh, which one?
[181:21.99]Let's see.
[181:23.09]This is red.
[181:27.56]Let's go.
[181:29.28]I'm not gonna say that, but you know what I was gonna say.
[181:57.73]Catboy practice?
[181:59.03]No, you have no idea.
[182:01.71]I can't wait to tell you about the Catboy stream.
[182:03.93]The thing I want to do in the Catboy stream.
[182:07.17]I can't wait to tell you about it like a year from now.
[182:14.50]Final floor.
[182:15.24]Let's go.
[182:15.56]They should put that in.
[182:22.73]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[182:39.71]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[182:43.97]It's a fucking bird from Donkey Kong.
[182:45.42]Run.
[183:03.61]The red liquid you see contains refined ultra spicy essence.
[183:06.71]One drop contains one dose.
[183:10.85]Press 2 to spray this extract on your entire group.
[183:15.27]Have you tried it yet?
[183:17.24]I have not, but I will in just a second.
[183:20.80]Spray!
[183:21.42]Spray it!
[183:27.62]Spray it!
[183:28.04]Let's go!
[183:37.06]Alright, pull back back back back back back back back back back back back.
[183:45.06]Where's it going? Attack!
[183:51.06]On his head! On his head! On his head, you dopes!
[184:00.16]Goood. Right under his chin. That's a weak part.
[184:11.16]Oh no.
[184:14.16]Where's he?
[184:19.31]Get on his head!
[184:20.59]Get on his head!
[184:24.67]What is the sound that Wiimote is making?
[184:29.18]What's the sound?
[184:30.92]Why is my Wiimote calling me?
[184:40.45]Well done.
[184:42.05]Captain Olimar, you've defeated that freakish half bird, half serpent hybrid.
[184:48.01]Oh no, don't tell me that treasure was ingested by the beast, wasn't it?
[184:57.72]Um, I think, um, I think I'm going to turn this off.
[185:02.56]I'm going to go into the settings and just turn off the Wiimote.
[185:05.86]Being able to make noise.
[185:15.64]very cool alright is that everything in here that's the last floor go deliver it use a game cube controller um I don't I'm on a Wii U I'm not on the wii
[185:45.73]This version doesn't support a gamepad.
[185:47.29]Okay.
[185:49.07]An adapter, you cheap bastard.
[185:50.77]I just put my arms in the air and went like, what?
[185:54.61]I didn't even know I was going to need it.
[185:58.45]I thought it was like a Wiimote game.
[186:02.38]The material looks comfortable.
[186:03.44]I'll use it to patch the boss's favorite sleeping bag.
[186:05.68]Ooh.
[186:05.78]Ooh.
[186:16.58]Seam test.
[186:17.18]Conclusive.
[186:18.02]Cross-stitching.
[186:18.56]Successful.
[186:19.00]The knapsack is complete.
[186:26.38]Oh, also, Pikmin 2 is, like, incredibly fucking hard to find, too.
[186:29.77]It's another one of those games that's, like, a shitload of money.
[186:34.37]And it might have taken long to get here.
[186:36.07]I don't know.
[186:40.16]I did not anticipate a lot of these first-party old Nintendo games are gonna be this hard to actually get a copy of.
[186:50.16]And I'm going to say this again, all you guys telling me to emulate a first party Nintendo game, you're going to get me fucking thrown in jail.
[186:55.68]They're coming after me if I do.
[186:56.66]You're trying to get me fucking, you're trying to get me taken?
[187:00.17]A first party Nintendo game you want me to emulate and be like, I'm emulating first party Nintendo game, what do I care?
[187:08.30]Alerts go off at Nintendo headquarters.
[187:16.22]Press and hold... Wait.
[187:18.61]When you have an unoccupied time interval, press and hold C to take a nap.
[187:38.84]Everyone does it.
[187:40.62]I don't care if the Queen of England does it.
[187:43.62]I'm...
[187:54.02]It would hold C. I don't want to hold C. How do I heal as Olimar?
[188:18.23]That was so cute.
[188:26.52]Alright, somebody just wrote, I used to emulate Pokémon at school back in the day, you boomer.
[188:35.17]Did you do it in front of 10,000 people?
[188:38.21]Saying, hey, I'm emulating, I didn't buy this?
[188:41.39]I think that's a small difference.
[188:59.59]Yeah, I did actually.
[189:00.63]Well, it looks like you got away with it.
[189:06.15]You don't have to say you're emulating it.
[189:07.79]Oh, people will know.
[189:10.79]I'll hit like escape and somebody will see like the emulator running and all of a sudden that's the running joke for the next like three days.
[189:16.52]You know how I know that?
[189:20.12]Because it's happened before.
[189:36.56]If I have to emulate, I do.
[189:37.74]Let me be very clear about that.
[189:42.60]But if I can play on original hardware, I like to play on original hardware for a couple of reasons.
[189:52.43]It's kind of cool to actually own the consoles and stuff.
[189:56.05]Sure, could I have emulated the entire Dreamcast stuff?
[189:58.35]Yeah, but I own the Dreamcast now and I have all that stuff.
[190:01.81]It's just kind of cool to have.
[190:17.08]That doesn't mean I'm against doing it.
[190:18.83]I've emulated plenty of games.
[190:28.55]Okay, I can do the gas thing now.
[190:29.91]Yeah.
[190:32.56]Criminal.
[190:37.14]There's the gas down here, right?
[190:41.60]Wait, I want to harvest this stuff.
[190:42.78]I'm going to sit here for a minute.
[190:48.43]Nintendo interest has intensified.
[190:50.05]I look, I just, I don't want to fuck around.
[190:55.84]Nintendo really had a major crackdown on emulating and emulated games and ROMs a year or two ago.
[191:01.94]I don't, I'm sorry.
[191:05.57]Nope.
[191:21.66]You need a good lawyer.
[191:25.42]Instead of having to worry about having a good lawyer, why don't I just play the one on Wii?
[191:36.29]Okay, I could either hire a lawyer and have thousands of dollars of a retainer fee or just play the game on Wii U. I think I would rather do the Wii U one.
[191:55.51]How do you like it so far?
[191:56.23]It's really fun.
[191:59.81]It's very fun.
[192:00.27]Alright, gas.
[192:14.61]Get through the gas.
[192:16.80]It was this way.
[192:18.84]Ooh, it's another globe.
[192:19.64]Cool, cool, cool.
[192:20.38]Oh, new level.
[192:21.90]Yes.
[192:27.52]Alright, where are they?
[192:31.28]Mmm, you're kind of stuck, aren't you?
[192:36.32]Go get it!
[192:38.51]This is gonna take a very long time, isn't it?
[192:41.25]Use the spray?
[192:42.37]That's true.
[192:57.57]I got one person.
[192:58.65]I didn't get anybody.
[192:59.23]I didn't hit one person with that.
[193:02.56]Why?
[193:03.54]You know what?
[193:10.44]You, Louie, you stay here.
[193:11.76]What else can we do in the meantime?
[193:23.73]I screamed at him.
[193:25.57]What can I do in the meantime?
[193:30.05]I don't think I can do anything in the meantime.
[193:36.83]Please look at a Pikmin idol animation.
[193:38.27]I'm begging you.
[193:40.69]Okay.
[193:49.98]Uh... Hold C. No.
[193:58.33]You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.
[194:01.57]Get over here.
[194:02.13]You're fine.
[194:02.51]Um, okay.
[194:06.63]I can't do anything.
[194:09.22]Dismiss and then watch.
[194:23.85]They sit down?
[194:31.17]Why is that such important?
[194:32.35]Why did you need to see that so bad?
[194:35.69]Okay.
[194:36.19]Um, can Olimar walk in here?
[194:44.20]We can kill that guy.
[194:44.90]Alright, let's kill that thing.
[194:50.78]Oh no, we can't.
[194:54.38]No.
[195:04.28]We get it?
[195:07.46]Yes!
[195:07.70]Alright, let's get in here.
[195:10.76]Get the globe.
[195:16.72]Oh!
[195:17.84]I didn't even look at the flowers.
[195:18.90]What have you guys done?
[195:37.53]Nope.
[195:38.01]Nope.
[195:38.71]Not even going to fucking address it.
[195:43.15]Fascinating.
[195:43.65]This object is highly similar to the one you found in the Valley of Repose.
[195:49.75]By examining this further, I may be able to extrapolate new planetary data.
[195:59.61]Oh, excuse me.
[196:00.25]Fight.
[196:04.68]Good.
[196:05.72]Blow him up.
[196:07.24]Alright, we're going to have a lot of things to take here.
[196:08.49]We have take his face and take the globe.
[196:14.61]Get that.
[196:15.31]Nice.
[196:15.53]Everybody on it?
[196:18.01]Bring it here.
[196:18.51]Here we go.
[196:19.27]Cool.
[196:21.03]We got a head.
[196:21.61]We got that.
[196:23.27]Where's Louie?
[196:24.77]Oh, he's right here.
[196:28.50]Nice.
[196:28.82]Okay, good.
[196:29.58]Bring it.
[196:29.86]There's a log there.
[196:32.64]There's one more thing over here, isn't there?
[196:35.20]Ooh.
[196:35.28]Ooh.
[196:36.91]Cannot go over here yet.
[196:37.87]This is like a Metroid.
[196:40.31]You have to get the right Pikmin to come back.
[196:41.73]You go back to the old levels and... A Metroidvania.
[197:12.10]I'm sorry.
[197:13.26]I will apologize for that one.
[197:14.40]I'm sorry.
[197:15.96]That one deserves an apology.
[197:18.16]Die, die, die.
[197:30.35]Die, die, die, die.
[197:32.56]You know how to do it.
[197:33.30]I'm a bird.
[197:34.20]You know what to do.
[197:34.86]You just have to call to me and I will call you.
[197:37.54]I will do it.
[197:47.28]All it took was somebody to write just that doy doy doy in chat and I just did it.
[197:59.41]Please do the scrumptious cake.
[198:03.50]I've said that so many times.
[198:04.80]Just go back to one of the times I said it.
[198:06.34]Okay.
[198:20.00]Do Megalovania doi doi doi, please.
[198:23.50]I don't think I can do that.
[198:35.89]I don't think that's possible.
[198:36.87]I don't think that's possible.
[198:52.43]It's too hard to do.
[199:02.11]Am I just a weird guy at the lunch table?
[199:05.90]Hey, hey, hey, dude.
[199:07.54]Hey, hey, watch this.
[199:09.00]Hey, hey, dude, do the doy, doy, doy, but this time do this song.
[199:12.80]Okay, sure thing.
[199:16.88]He did it.
[199:17.26]He actually did it.
[199:17.88]He's going to get detention now.
[199:21.80]Jeremy.
[199:23.43]What?
[199:24.61]You think it's funny to make noises in the middle of the lunchroom?
[199:27.99]Yeah, I just wanted to have fun.
[199:30.59]That's two more days of detention.
[199:33.88]I'm reliving what happened when I was in fucking high school.
[199:37.71]That's actually what happened.
[199:38.77]Okay.
[199:56.69]Hey, dude, hey, do doy doy doy again.
[199:59.07]Like, turn, do it like right into the air and then make an elephant noise after.
[200:02.89]No, I'm not going to do that.
[200:03.74]I'm not going to do an elephant noise at the end.
[200:05.72]Yeah, dude, come on, do it.
[200:06.60]It'll be funny.
[200:07.50]I'm not going to do it.
[200:08.12]Alright.
[200:11.98]This actually was real.
[200:17.12]Same shit happens on every stream.
[200:27.30]back everybody go I guess go home do doi doi doi it'll be wicked funny don't go to sleep
[200:58.78]Oh, dude, dude, doy, doy, doy.
[201:00.10]It'll be wicked funny.
[201:12.47]Pause the end day early?
[201:13.75]Oh, okay.
[201:17.84]Pickman top left?
[201:37.63]It's my birthday today.
[201:41.77]Or it would have been if you didn't throw me into the water two hours ago.
[201:44.03]By the way, I am red picking number 94.
[201:47.40]Sorry about that.
[202:02.75]That was a lot of money today.
[202:03.55]810 bucks.
[202:05.59]That's pretty good.
[202:10.67]Who died?
[202:14.38]I've only lost Pikmin to battle.
[202:17.08]Nothing else?
[202:20.42]What?
[202:41.15]New level unlocked.
[202:42.69]Where is it?
[202:43.11]New treasure.
[202:56.78]Very cool.
[203:01.54]I want to see the tape up close.
[203:04.77]Oh, that's good.
[203:14.80]What did he say about his wife?
[203:15.48]I thought this was like a piece of shit or something.
[203:40.91]Well, it is, but I thought it was an actual, like, ship.
[203:44.57]This is a shoe polish.
[203:48.45]There are several different patterns drawn on this object's surface.
[203:51.45]They appear to be characters or letters.
[203:53.65]Can't make any sense of them.
[203:54.41]This is just an educated guess, but I wonder if this object is kind of an alien bulletin board.
[203:57.93]The size of the object seems about right for it.
[204:01.01]That's cool.
[204:06.75]What's this one?
[204:10.42]Today I delivered an impromptu lecture on the basics of wilderness survival.
[204:15.03]As Louie's superior, it's my responsibility to teach him these skills.
[204:19.61]Walking around as much as we do generates an intense thirst, so water becomes very important.
[204:24.24]I told Louie that we have to ration our water carefully.
[204:26.86]That's what I was thinking until I found this.
[204:28.98]I was so parched that I couldn't help myself.
[204:31.48]I drank all the water in the canteen.
[204:34.16]It tasted so good.
[204:36.59]When I turned around, Louie gave me a cold stare.
[204:48.00]Go to area select.
[204:50.12]Okay, well, I have new... I'm going to go back to the first zone.
[204:58.29]I think I could probably dig something up, maybe?
[205:02.64]I'm going to go first zone.
[205:05.58]No, I need water first.
[205:06.80]I guarantee to get water Pikmin here.
[205:12.68]John Oliver.
[205:17.96]How many zones are in the game?
[205:26.67]Four.
[205:29.21]Cool.
[205:29.51]So you're just supposed to go all around and go back and forth and stuff.
[205:37.94]The two types are sleeping well and do not quarrel.
[205:39.76]I have made them most comfortable.
[205:41.12]That's good.
[205:42.88]You can call out the white Pikmin by standing in the light beneath me.
[205:45.17]Yes, yes, yes.
[205:48.61]Okay.
[205:54.82]Well, there you go.
[205:55.26]If you retire early for the day, press start and then press right on the D-pad.
[205:58.92]Alright, so what do we need?
[206:04.08]I'm going to assess the area.
[206:11.55]Oh, yellow.
[206:15.25]Wild Pikmin, can you see them?
[206:16.75]Captain Olimar.
[206:19.69]They're yellow Pikmin.
[206:20.57]You encountered them when you crashed on this planet, correct?
[206:22.89]It would be most helpful if they remember you like the red ones did.
[206:26.99]Yes, most helpful.
[206:27.83]Uh, where are they?
[206:43.20]There's a frog guy over here.
[206:44.20]There's a cave right there.
[206:46.56]Alright, let's just take the crew.
[206:55.95]Wait.
[206:56.09]Is that like a competing franchise?
[207:01.72]What's that?
[207:02.60]Oh, no, that's yellow.
[207:03.42]Okay.
[207:06.32]Alright, I'm going to take a crew.
[207:07.48]Alright, I'm going to take 50 red.
[207:22.53]And then...
[207:25.86]All of these.
[207:28.06]And all the purples.
[207:28.76]What does that leave me with?
[207:31.50]I can still get a few more.
[207:45.23]Okay.
[207:47.17]Okay.
[207:54.23]Well, let's first kill this thing.
[207:55.23]Because why let it live when we can dissect it and research it?
[208:08.71]We didn't kill anybody, right?
[208:11.05]Who died?
[208:12.19]A red Pikmin died.
[208:13.01]That's okay.
[208:20.16]Um... Where do I bring this?
[208:25.42]I gotta put that in the yellow one.
[208:27.00]Where's the yellow?
[208:27.64]Alright, let's just follow them.
[208:28.70]Am I putting this yellow one in the red one?
[208:47.37]Whistle them.
[208:53.95]Put the lime in the coconut.
[209:01.08]You put the yellow in the red, it explodes.
[209:02.92]Well, okay.
[209:03.84]I know that's not real.
[209:09.31]I think I'm not... I think I'm supposed to put that in the other one.
[209:25.33]Follow me.
[209:27.68]Sing it.
[209:28.02]Big subs.
[209:30.40]Thanks for the... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.
[209:43.63]Why is he going in there by himself?
[209:51.97]I could hear how bad that singing sounded, so I stopped immediately.
[209:54.49]Sometimes I can do pretty well.
[210:00.71]This hole is filled with wretched, nasty bugs.
[210:09.00]Are we fighting, or what?
[210:11.44]Alright, take those bugs.
[210:15.26]There's a flying one right there.
[210:21.41]I crushed his head.
[210:24.11]I'll take him.
[210:29.98]What's back here?
[210:30.64]I can't go in the water.
[210:31.44]I can't go in the water.
[210:33.24]I can go in there.
[210:36.63]Hold on.
[210:40.27]Go over this way for a sec.
[210:54.24]Can we get up here?
[210:59.17]What does that mean?
[210:59.87]201.
[210:59.89]Okay, now we're going to go
[211:25.69]Do they balance this?
[211:30.64]Is that what this wants me to do?
[211:32.34]It doesn't want me to go up on top of this.
[211:39.20]Why is it lagging so much?
[211:44.18]It's an elevator.
[211:48.20]What's the point of this, though?
[211:49.04]I don't know.
[211:54.14]Why do I need to use this?
[211:58.74]What's it for?
[211:59.20]I just don't get it.
[212:04.90]If one of them is... We can go up and then... Oh, wait.
[212:14.14]I can't get there from over here?
[212:15.02]Oh, I thought I came from over here.
[212:16.92]Never mind.
[212:17.42]Hold on.
[212:18.04]No, I thought I came from up there.
[212:37.19]Oh, Jesus.
[212:40.79]Bring him down.
[212:45.47]Kill him.
[212:46.69]Oh, my God.
[212:53.62]Why is it running like shit?
[213:05.70]Emulator.
[213:08.34]Hold on.
[213:08.62]I need to shake my hand because holding a Wiimote forward for three and a half hours sucks.
[213:16.75]They didn't think about that, though.
[213:18.41]It was just play with your grandmother Wii Sports for 15 minutes.
[213:20.71]Alright, I'm ready.
[213:24.14]Eggs.
[213:33.67]Eggs.
[213:37.53]Uh, split this up for a second.
[213:38.51]Hold on.
[213:39.45]No, no, no.
[213:39.83]Get over here.
[213:41.49]I want to get everybody up here.
[213:42.85]Oh, stand on that.
[213:52.36]Back up.
[213:56.82]Can I not get everybody up here?
[214:11.87]I'm trying to like weigh this down so I can't.
[214:17.21]Okay.
[214:44.04]No!
[214:46.32]We need that guy.
[214:58.95]Oh my god.
[214:59.57]Hold on.
[214:59.91]I gotta take a break.
[215:00.81]I gotta like stretch my arms.
[215:04.08]Ugh.
[215:05.18]My like right elbow is like dying right now.
[215:09.85]From holding my hand forward.
[215:13.83]Like I'm changing the channel on a TV station.
[215:18.33]Hold on.
[215:20.07]Oh, shit.
[215:20.43]Pause again.
[215:23.71]Tennis elbow.
[215:24.49]Wee elbow.
[215:34.11]End of the stream.
[215:35.13]No, not yet.
[215:39.03]I think...
[215:39.78]Let me stand up.
[215:42.94]Alright.
[215:44.86]I wish I could do... You know what?
[215:46.58]I wish I could do this with my eyes.
[215:48.74]See, they really fucked up this technology.
[215:52.64]Imagine the Wiimote pointer.
[215:54.39]You could just do it with your eyes.
[215:55.39]Let's try this again.
[216:03.13]Instead of having to lean forward and creep and hold my hand out...
[216:12.30]Alright, so you stay here.
[216:13.30]Get over here.
[216:15.55]No, I don't even... Why do you keep giving me people?
[216:17.53]I...
[216:45.01]why can't I do this I'm missing something very important here why can't I do this I can't I'm just gonna throw them up there
[217:19.04]I thought I'm not supposed to like get on the escalator, elevator with like two people or something.
[217:26.28]I'm starting to really hate this fucking controller more than anything.
[217:28.62]Oh my fucking god.
[217:37.48]Go, go!
[217:44.00]No, don't go!
[217:53.55]Louie, are you not strong enough to do this shit?
[218:01.00]Why can't you do it now?
[218:03.36]Alright, now fuck off, all of you.
[218:07.88]I'm running out of daylight here.
[218:10.32]Fuck this controller.
[218:12.19]It was made for three games.
[218:27.23]Alright, you take this guy back.
[218:29.83]Oh, can they?
[218:30.37]Okay.
[218:54.97]Based and rage pilled.
[218:58.01]I'm serious.
[219:03.42]This controller works well in like 12 games out of 5,000.
[219:21.12]Alright, Louie's down there.
[219:21.92]Can I do anything else here while they get that gate?
[219:23.36]Can we take this?
[219:28.52]Oh, we can.
[219:28.89]Get him.
[219:29.17]Bring him back.
[219:46.66]I'm out of time.
[219:50.87]We're out of time.
[219:51.49]Can these guys even get down here?
[219:56.29]Let's just walk off the edge.
[219:59.29]The Wiimote threw the screen already.
[220:06.10]I know it's almost time.
[220:07.08]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[220:08.14]Can you guys get this, please, in time?
[220:16.29]Come on, you can do it.
[220:19.74]There's a huge thing in here.
[220:22.70]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[221:04.36]They couldn't do it.
[221:04.84]They couldn't do it.
[221:05.28]They couldn't do it.
[221:05.98]Okay.
[221:22.72]I left behind.
[221:23.52]Wait, how many?
[221:24.36]30 people were left.
[221:26.28]No, they were.
[221:26.84]I thought I went down there with Louie.
[221:35.95]Fucking elevator.
[221:36.85]Yeah, why is it even there?
[221:41.60]Fucking stupid elevator.
[221:43.04]Well, for what?
[221:44.76]I'm gonna throw the Pikmin up.
[221:46.38]I throw them over the elevator.
[221:47.96]I was so hell-bent on figuring out what I need to do with the elevator.
[221:52.18]Just throw them over there.
[222:08.53]I went to Happy Hockatate Savings and Loan, but it seems my loan came from the shop next door.
[222:13.78]All devouring black hole loan sharks.
[222:17.04]That sounds bad.
[222:28.37]Okay.
[222:28.51]I'm going to go back here.
[222:34.33]Did they even get the...
[222:39.28]They got it back in time, right?
[222:40.22]Did they get the big guy?
[222:47.56]Or did they not get the big guy?
[222:56.72]Alright, let's go.
[222:57.24]We lost one big guy.
[223:04.83]Damn it.
[223:18.10]Everybody follow me.
[223:26.46]I want to go back to that gate.
[223:28.62]This time I'm not going to sit here for 12 minutes fighting this stupid elevator.
[223:39.95]Can I go in here?
[223:40.47]Whoa, what is this?
[223:44.83]A maze?
[223:45.31]Kind of.
[223:58.10]You alright?
[223:58.48]Somebody die?
[224:00.79]Well, keep up with the group.
[224:01.91]What the fuck are you doing?
[224:02.83]Why would you stop to fight that thing?
[224:05.13]We're all clearly running this way.
[224:06.61]What are you, insane?
[224:07.39]It's cruel.
[224:20.96]Alright.
[224:21.62]Let's do this stupid thing again.
[224:23.26]And I'm just gonna go up.
[224:31.52]Louis, you stay down here.
[225:08.53]I just want to say you're a cool guy.
[225:09.93]Hey, thanks.
[225:19.66]This thing's dead.
[225:21.18]All you little things.
[225:23.97]Okay, this way.
[225:25.57]Get it.
[225:37.40]That was a shitty reaction.
[225:39.70]I mean, thank you.
[225:43.02]For a second I thought it was sarcastic.
[225:49.25]It may have been.
[225:50.15]Did I get it?
[225:51.69]Good.
[225:58.29]Okay, so now... There it is.
[226:00.59]There's the yellow ship.
[226:03.43]Alright.
[226:04.83]I've discovered yellow ship.
[226:07.74]Hello.
[226:10.22]Okay.
[226:12.18]Okay, hi guys!
[226:24.41]Hey, can we fart together at the next TwitchCon?
[226:26.25]No.
[226:30.15]The yellow Pikmin have climbed down the tree.
[226:31.56]They appear to like high places and seem to be quite light.
[226:35.36]They have very large ears.
[226:39.57]Ear Pikmin, but I will give them the name Olimar gave them.
[226:44.11]My static electricity sensors are reaching violently.
[226:47.33]What could that mean?
[226:48.13]Is there electric?
[226:52.51]Alright, now we can deposit the things here.
[226:55.59]Let's do that now.
[226:58.20]That's a big ten.
[227:09.41]Bring it into the ship.
[227:13.51]Where are you going?
[227:14.97]Where are you going?
[227:15.42]Where are you going?
[227:15.88]Where are you going?
[227:19.90]Where are you going?
[227:20.78]It has to be yellow that picks them up?
[227:29.44]Oh, it has to be predominantly yellow that carries them.
[227:32.05]Okay, I see.
[227:38.48]Get back here, that fucking thing.
[227:40.40]Oh, shit.
[227:42.66]Lucky.
[227:43.58]Okay, well.
[227:48.26]Hold on.
[227:51.09]You little dicks.
[227:52.65]Alright.
[227:53.81]Spread out.

[228:06.32]Wait.
[228:06.90]Louis, stay down there.
[228:29.22]No, don't let Red take it.
[228:31.77]Where are you letting Red take it for?
[228:34.51]Put it down.
[228:35.39]Put that down.
[228:36.27]Put it down.
[228:38.49]You know what?
[228:42.69]Leave it alone.
[228:55.79]Bring it.
[228:59.09]Okay, we're good.
[228:59.55]How are they going to do this?
[229:05.31]Wait, why?
[229:05.69]Where are they going with that?
[229:09.97]They're too far away.
[229:10.87]Where are they going?
[229:14.15]Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.
[229:16.15]Follow me, please.

[229:31.79]Shit.
[229:35.61]Come on.
[229:36.96]You stupid guy.
[229:39.04]Why would you walk it all the way if you can't bring it back?
[229:41.32]Why would... Just go back up there and hang out for a while.
[229:45.32]Shit.
[229:49.90]Did somebody just die?
[229:53.83]Give me another one.

[231:30.05]My God.

[233:08.70]What is this?
[233:09.28]A strange mold-like botanical entity has spread across the ground here.
[233:14.83]Interesting.

[243:32.54]Behind you.
[243:39.43]It is a piece of treasure.
[243:40.42]The white can dig, can't they?
[243:41.62]Is there a way I can make them dig?
[243:47.08]Where is this?
[243:47.56]It's up there.
[243:59.11]Yes!
[243:59.83]Dig it out.
[244:02.68]What is it?
[244:11.94]Up and dig.
[244:15.07]Ooh, it's like a coconut.
[244:16.31]What is that?
[244:16.73]Ooh, it's, um, I don't know, like a seed or something.
[244:21.19]He might as well take his dead body.
[244:47.05]Ooh, it's a plant.
[244:50.37]Pilgrim bulb.
[244:57.99]This is very sad.
[244:58.81]These guys are so cute, though.
[245:01.06]They really are.
[245:01.62]They're the cutest.
[245:06.24]Nobody move.
[245:07.36]I want yellow to take that.
[245:17.76]Why are you bringing it?
[245:19.56]Why is it red now?
[245:20.16]What are you people doing?
[245:31.17]Bring it to yellow.
[245:39.81]I feel like I'm running out of space.
[245:41.21]Do I have enough space for all these people?
[245:50.37]You don't want... I already have a lot of red.
[245:51.71]Alright.
[245:52.53]That's what I'm... I remember that.
[245:53.73]That's why I came here.
[245:54.45]And I also want to do electricity.
[245:55.79]Where is that?
[245:57.51]Oh, plant life.
[246:00.75]One of these things.
[246:01.27]This way.
[246:09.80]Where's that electric fence?
[246:17.72]Up here?
[246:25.80]Why is he still playing this?
[246:27.06]Correct me if I'm wrong here, but you don't really just like play Pikmin for 15 minutes.
[246:32.98]It's not like, oh, I'm going to play this for like 20 minutes.
[246:42.47]What's wrong with this?
[246:46.43]There we go.
[246:46.79]Okay.
[246:47.45]I do want some of these.
[246:55.18]Not ready yet?
[246:56.60]Oh, fine.
[247:02.80]Treasure somewhere.
[247:04.71]The buried treasure?
[247:05.37]I don't care about that right now.
[247:20.05]Kill it!
[247:21.27]Kill it!
[247:21.73]Kill it!
[247:22.15]Kill it!
[247:22.59]Kill it!
[247:23.01]Kill it!
[247:29.89]I want yellow to take that.
[247:38.48]No, no, no.
[247:38.80]Yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow.
[247:40.24]I want yellow.
[247:42.10]I feel like the level's not big enough.
[247:48.94]Alright, take it.
[247:52.73]We have to keep harvesting people.
[247:58.44]Leave them alone.
[248:04.26]Alright.
[248:05.12]Electricity was... Oh, gas.
[248:09.49]Nice.
[248:09.73]Alright.
[248:10.07]I can get this done.
[248:12.43]I need the white.
[248:27.56]You know what to do.
[248:28.06]Get over there.
[248:30.80]Okay, they're going to be working on that.
[248:37.18]Now let's take this guy back.
[248:39.58]It's going to be red.
[248:40.08]That's fine.
[248:45.15]What does that lead to?
[248:46.33]Another elevator.
[248:47.01]Great.
[248:48.73]Spray, spray, spray them.
[248:49.53]Spray them.
[248:49.83]Spray, spray, spray.
[248:53.23]Can I spray them?
[248:53.89]Spray them and then throw them back?
[249:01.08]Here we go.
[249:02.43]Go for it!
[249:03.53]Alright, now what?
[249:15.33]Wait till that's done and then... Oh, my fucking arm.
[249:23.88]Where's this treasure?
[249:27.98]It's up there, right?
[249:34.52]How do we get up there though?
[249:36.82]Oh, okay.
[249:37.32]This way.
[249:42.21]End of the stream?
[249:43.01]No, not yet.
[249:45.55]You know what?
[249:46.05]Hey.
[249:47.35]Louie, go get those guys.
[249:48.26]There's like 10 electricity dudes over here.
[249:50.44]You guys said yellow can jump higher, right?
[250:10.56]Excuse me.
[250:13.74]Yellow can be thrown higher.
[250:14.94]Okay.
[250:15.38]Let's see if I can get it.
[250:16.08]This is going to kill me, isn't it?
[250:19.53]Are they going to get it?
[250:25.11]Where are they going to bring it?
[250:29.99]Oh, shit.
[250:30.39]They can just fall down.
[250:31.47]Nice.
[250:31.83]Alright.
[250:32.11]What is that?
[250:32.41]Chapstick?
[250:34.03]Oh, hell yeah.
[250:37.07]I wasn't trying to get out of this.
[250:52.12]A lot of the yellows.
[250:57.05]Okay, good.
[251:02.01]That wall almost down.
[251:05.32]That's a glyph on chapstick.
[251:14.63]Healing cask.
[251:18.13]I'm going to keep these guys back here because I'm afraid to go over there because it's almost time to leave.
[251:21.13]They almost got it.
[251:24.99]Electric fences up here.
[251:29.18]I'm coming back here next level.
[251:35.69]You got it?
[251:37.71]Yes.
[251:37.85]We're good.
[251:48.58]Alright.
[251:49.16]Now, fucking elevator.
[251:53.42]The things I hate the most.
[252:19.66]I didn't mean to do that.
[252:20.56]The fucking Wiimote, I swear to God.
[252:22.86]I didn't want to do that.
[252:33.50]Starting to get really, really heated in my brain.
[252:46.06]No.
[252:46.64]Oh my god.
[252:47.61]This Wiimote.
[252:48.63]I'm gonna fucking swallow it whole.
[252:50.09]I swear to god.
[253:00.21]Come on.
[253:00.49]Bring it.
[253:05.42]Get it down here.
[253:05.96]Let's go.
[253:10.80]Yes!
[253:19.19]Get some more of these berries.
[253:21.31]I demand it.
[253:28.40]Imagine losing to a fucking scale.
[253:31.28]Stop.
[253:37.32]This game used to make me bite my Wiimote.
[253:39.74]Okay.
[253:41.04]I doubt it.
[253:45.59]Alright, come back, come back, come back.
[253:57.52]Okay, we gotta go.
[253:58.22]There's other ones here.
[254:00.60]Where are they?
[254:00.94]I'm not missing anybody, right?
[254:14.16]That's the ship.
[254:14.88]Where's Louie?
[254:16.64]White Flower Garden?
[254:18.76]Wait, what the hell is that?
[254:23.63]I think I'm good.
[254:25.09]There are 32 that are free.
[254:26.43]Where are they?
[254:27.49]That's it, right?
[254:35.67]Five that are free.
[254:36.63]Where are they?
[254:38.61]I think it's the blue ones.
[254:40.45]We're good.
[254:42.51]Yeah, we're good.
[254:54.12]We're good.
[254:56.02]Cool.
[254:56.46]Alright, I want to come back here and I want to go back up to the top there.
[255:00.15]Actually, maybe I can't.
[255:01.45]I think that's everything I can do here for now.
[255:05.77]I could go in there, but... Hmm.
[255:20.08]Oh, there's an electric fence up there.
[255:21.64]That's right.
[255:22.70]I'll go back.
[255:31.68]We'll probably play this again.
[255:32.52]We'll probably do this again on Sunday.
[255:45.11]I'm not into this stream.
[255:53.58]Super Bowl Sunday.
[255:59.12]I don't care who's in the Super Bowl anymore.
[256:00.70]Tom Brady's not in the Patriots anymore.
[256:04.74]You have to say that.
[256:05.62]You have to say that.
[256:07.34]You have to say Super Bowl.
[256:11.12]Whatever.
[256:11.52]I don't even fucking care.
[256:12.51]I'm playing pigment on Sunday.
[256:19.05]Hi, Papa.
[256:19.89]Mama heard you got a promotion, so she's very happy.
[256:22.95]You have lots of people under you now, right?
[256:27.13]so does this mean you're a super captain?
[256:32.54]um it's 11 30 at night and son you're calling me oh you're not in bed you're supposed to be in bed at 10 30. it's a different planet
[257:02.40]I'm angry because it's local time here.
[257:04.02]Alright.
[257:06.76]We're getting a lot of yellows because of the electric fence that I want to get to.
[257:12.27]I got 55 yellows.
[257:12.93]Holy shit.
[257:15.31]Let's do 30 yellow.
[257:17.35]30 yellow and a bunch of purple.
[257:27.19]And then I think
[257:30.43]Should I even bring any?
[257:31.93]I'll bring like two.
[257:32.77]We'll bring four.
[257:35.71]And then the rest spread.
[257:48.81]It's 95.
[257:49.19]Cool.
[257:51.13]Alright, let's go to the electric fence.
[258:00.03]Which was up this way.
[258:01.39]Do you know that Joel thought you were a Christian streamer that didn't swear before he started talking to me?
[258:14.28]You guys did that.
[258:14.96]That's your doing.
[258:21.06]That's not my doing.
[258:31.07]Where's that electric fence?
[258:32.05]Right there, okay.
[258:34.77]Oh, a stupid elevator.
[258:51.42]You get on there.
[258:52.02]Oh my fucking god.
[258:57.70]Oh my fucking god.
[259:04.47]Where'd you go?
[259:06.85]Oh.
[259:08.96]Oh.
[259:09.84]Oh, God.
[259:10.52]They all fell off the edge.
[259:44.48]They should profile you in the newspaper.
[259:46.16]Why?
[259:46.40]So, like, fucking 15 people can read it?
[259:48.31]That was, like, kind of rude.
[259:52.75]Alright, we're gonna go up here.
[260:05.00]Only bring yellow up here.
[260:12.29]That was extremely rude, you millionaire.
[260:14.45]No, that's not what I was talking about.
[260:16.43]I'm talking about that, like, who... Okay.
[260:20.13]Let's go ahead and go over this, because a lot of you... When was the last time anybody in this chat read a newspaper?
[260:27.65]Say one.
[260:29.25]One in the chat.
[260:31.91]I'm serious.
[260:32.49]When was the last time any of you read a newspaper?
[260:38.38]No.
[260:39.88]You're a liar.
[260:43.58]No, no, no.
[260:43.92]I'm not talking about like an online publication of a newspaper.
[260:47.07]I'm talking about a newspaper that you hold and fold in your hand.
[260:56.01]Alright.
[261:00.05]Wait, should I fart on them?
[261:04.08]Alright.
[261:05.16]Get in there.
[261:05.54]Let's go.
[261:08.78]Take that down.
[261:12.80]It's free, so I read it.
[261:13.68]I literally get my New York Times delivered.
[261:20.46]I don't think you do.
[261:25.72]I'm missing a couple guys.
[261:31.16]Up here.
[261:39.40]Come on, you can do it.
[261:40.41]There's a lot of you guys down here.
[261:41.31]Come on, let's go.
[261:54.14]I can't tell you the last time I read a newspaper.
[261:59.95]Reddit.com is most of the millennial generation's newspaper.
[262:15.80]Am I a boomer?
[262:17.16]I'm not a boomer.
[262:20.64]I'm a millennial.
[262:21.90]Just like you.
[262:22.38]We're the same.
[262:28.71]Okay, cool.
[262:29.51]So now there's another place to go.
[262:30.97]Should I go down here?
[262:31.81]Let's see.
[262:33.69]Uh, where's... Hold on.
[262:34.95]You guys stay there.
[262:39.85]An X?
[262:40.47]No, I'm a millennial.
[262:45.51]I'm a millennial.
[262:47.27]Yes, I am.
[262:59.19]Can they all even fit up here?
[263:11.84]Not really.
[263:21.99]You're five years younger than my mom, mate.
[263:24.13]You're not like me.
[263:27.22]What?
[263:41.04]How old are you?
[263:41.90]39 39? 40?
[264:01.48]Yeah, I am kind of old, aren't I?
[264:02.88]I wasn't even reading any of that.
[264:03.90]What did it say?
[264:09.93]That guy could be like 21.
[264:10.79]Holy shit.
[264:15.43]Oh my god.
[264:21.47]I'm too old.
[264:23.19]I'm way too old.
[264:30.50]I'm a dinosaur now.
[264:32.10]Hope I don't need blue Pikmin in here.
[264:48.03]Ooh, what's this?
[264:52.21]Wait, is this a red flower?
[264:53.49]I don't think I want to turn anybody red.
[265:00.05]Is this orange or red?
[265:01.02]I don't think I want red.
[265:05.62]That guy looks scary.
[265:29.03]Hey guys, we're the big guys.
[265:34.93]Oh shit, he killed a few people.
[265:35.95]OK, easy.
[265:38.60]Easy.
[265:39.32]Oh shit, there's a lot of those guys.
[265:46.28]I want purple first.
[266:06.35]Easy.
[266:08.31]Oh, there's a guy on me.
[266:13.94]Relax.
[266:16.64]Oh, what'd he drop?
[266:17.26]What is that?
[266:20.42]It's a jewel.
[266:24.65]That's such an overreaction to that.
[266:42.71]150, that's a lot.
[266:45.75]Crystal Clover.
[266:49.51]I am going to turn some reds into whites here.
[267:07.40]It's okay to react to things.
[267:08.58]Yeah, I know.
[267:09.08]I'm just kidding around.
[267:20.45]Alright, let's keep going.
[267:25.15]91.
[267:25.17]That's it, right?
[267:25.93]What else?
[267:27.99]What is it?
[267:31.50]I don't know if I should turn.
[267:32.40]No.
[267:44.38]He's reacting.
[267:44.96]Someone stop him.
[267:49.57]Why is your chat the weird table in lunch class?

[268:23.51]Does this guy fire?
[268:26.93]Get him.
[268:34.61]Don't put his head.
[268:41.81]They're immune to fire.
[268:43.05]What do you think you're doing?
[268:48.75]God, I'm sorry.

[278:37.69]You can't just bully people that we raid.
[278:55.98]But if somebody's streaming and they don't want to sing a raid song, they don't have to sing a raid song.
[279:06.43]Do you really want us to be like a lunch table where only the five of us can sit at this lunch table?
[279:11.55]Ooh, nice.
[279:25.13]Yes, that's what we want.
[279:26.09]I almost got shocked.
[279:34.04]Okay, that's good.
[279:36.44]Where's more electricity?
[279:37.54]Ooh, more purple.
[279:39.90]Electric bugs.

[280:31.72]Okay.
[280:33.70]Separate that again.
[280:34.34]That could have been much worse.
[280:37.14]That could have been a lot worse.
[280:39.58]Bring him back.
[280:40.06]I want to turn the camera.
[280:53.74]There we go.
[280:57.59]I think he shit himself.
[280:59.11]I may have.
[281:13.44]What happened?
[281:16.27]Oh.
[281:16.41]Am I religious at all?
[281:17.25]Not really.
[281:17.59]Alright, let's get the... Hold on, not yet.
[281:30.85]Any more big guys?
[281:41.69]Hey, I'll tell you, I'm not religious.
[281:43.91]I'm not religious at all.
[281:45.73]But, I mean, I don't know.
[281:49.52]It could be.
[281:50.92]Aliens could have made us.
[281:52.30]There could be a god.
[281:53.06]I don't know.
[281:53.64]I have no idea.
[282:04.97]I really have no idea.
[282:06.79]I couldn't tell you either way.
[282:22.38]agnostic Andy I don't know I couldn't tell you one way or another if like dinosaur poop turned into us
[282:44.10]If aliens decided to come by one day and drop off like a specimen into the water and just run.
[282:49.62]Like it was a fucking prank.
[282:52.18]I don't know.
[282:54.00]Or if like God created- Oh!
[282:57.11]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[283:17.21]That would be a pretty good prank.
[283:20.64]You know what I mean though?
[283:21.36]Like just, I don't know.
[283:22.12]We could be, we could be an experiment.
[283:48.24]Something in there.
[283:48.74]Alright, drag him out.
[283:58.95]Get him out.
[284:04.25]Get out here.
[284:09.41]Get out of your hole.
[284:10.13]He doesn't want to come out.
[284:16.61]It's too bad because I think there's probably something in here.
[284:25.43]Golden fucking bug.
[284:32.70]Whoa.
[284:38.82]What is that?
[284:39.30]I just got a golden bug.
[284:40.30]That's like a... Holy shit.
[284:42.56]Okay, cool.
[284:42.90]What does that get me?
[284:44.51]Does it get me anything?
[284:50.10]I got a gold bug.
[284:57.46]That's it?
[284:58.24]For a golden bug?
[285:05.20]I don't think that's enough.
[285:05.92]I think that's... I need more.
[285:11.50]I want to kill this guy.
[285:13.23]But, you know, can I flip him over with a big dude?
[285:18.37]Alright, everyone get him now.
[285:21.26]Don't let him get up.
[285:22.58]Overwhelm him.
[285:23.90]Good.
[285:26.48]And I'll bring him back.
[285:31.59]I got all the treasures.
[285:32.43]Cool.
[285:33.25]Nice.
[285:33.71]Did he not get it?
[285:40.63]Come on.
[285:42.97]You cannot pick that up.
[285:43.76]Come on, boy.
[285:46.22]Of course you can.
[286:00.54]Who hasn't eaten?
[286:01.14]A lot of the purples haven't.
[286:06.94]Ooh, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[286:08.34]Okay, cool, cool, cool.
[286:09.84]Now what?
[286:12.82]Do I have everybody?
[286:13.66]I think I do.
[286:18.60]Yeah, let's keep going.
[286:20.16]Got all the treasures.
[286:25.22]Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
[286:40.73]Goldback's Kingdom.
[286:43.96]Is this a boss?
[286:45.16]I'm going to get another boss, aren't I?
[286:48.56]This is still not the bottom.
[286:50.96]Oh, shit.
[286:51.54]Okay, hold on.
[286:55.49]Line up.
[287:04.58]I'm really getting the hang of this.
[287:05.64]I'm starting to understand this a lot.
[287:10.87]Devon chat.
[287:11.95]Real Devon.
[287:12.65]Why is everybody saying that?
[287:21.72]Seven gold?
[287:22.32]That's not that much.
[287:23.12]Because they're here.
[287:25.54]I'm just hitting the head.
[287:34.95]Ooh.
[287:37.03]Who hasn't eaten?
[287:43.27]Pine cone.
[287:45.99]I think everybody has eaten.
[287:46.91]Look at that.
[287:48.02]We got full bellies all around.
[287:49.42]50 cents or coins.
[288:04.73]Those are Mario coins.
[288:10.15]That's not it.
[288:10.59]There's another one in here somewhere.
[288:12.05]Oh no, that's it.
[288:14.75]Alright.
[288:15.27]This was kind of a small area.
[288:16.55]This is randomly generated.
[288:17.54]This seems tiny.
[288:18.98]Level five.
[288:25.34]That's a bomb.
[288:30.48]Okay.
[288:30.64]This bombs.
[288:42.25]Level six.
[288:51.03]Hello, Mr. Otto.
[288:51.59]What's the matter?
[288:53.77]Are you hungry?
[288:56.99]Me too.
[289:06.89]We're still not at the end.
[289:08.36]Alright, this looks dangerous.
[289:10.84]I'm going to go this way.
[289:13.16]More red.
[289:17.64]Alright, same deal.
[289:26.40]Okay, good.
[289:26.88]Pick up that medallion.
[289:28.38]Holy shit.
[289:28.86]Alright, cool.
[289:36.74]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[289:38.08]Call back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[289:39.30]Everybody back.
[289:39.76]Everybody back.
[289:40.22]That was my mistake.
[289:41.26]I've fucked it up.
[289:55.64]I thought I could throw it over the guy's body.
[290:00.52]Mr. Noodle?
[290:03.92]Mr. Noodle?
[290:05.26]Mr. Noodle?
[290:06.78]Mr. Noodle?
[290:12.31]I am a fucking bird, I really am.
[290:16.35]In truth, this creature showed symptoms of poisoning after consuming the white Pikmin.
[290:22.80]Perhaps white Pikmin excrete a poisonous substance when chewed.
[290:25.32]How fascinating.
[290:31.60]Lost a couple people though.
[290:32.96]Alright, whatever.
[290:37.15]What else is in here?
[290:37.83]Uh, fire stuff.
[290:40.23]Let's put you guys up.
[290:46.85]Turn off all these geysers.
[290:56.24]Get it.
[290:58.78]Kill it.
[291:01.93]Do these things even fight back?
[291:09.79]I feel like they don't.
[291:12.35]Oh, fuck.
[291:13.37]Pull back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[291:14.57]There's a bomb in there.
[291:15.49]Pull back, pull back.
[291:17.97]I think I'm good.
[291:24.17]Alright.
[291:25.82]Let's just clean this up.
[291:26.98]Pick all this stuff up.
[291:31.58]Any of my other buddies?
[291:34.62]Where's Louie?
[291:35.42]Oh.
[291:35.56]Look at all that nectar.
[291:43.83]Yeah, it's too bad I don't even need to use it.
[291:45.93]Everybody's already pretty much maxed out.
[292:04.13]Oh, hold on.
[292:04.75]81, alright.
[292:06.23]Again, bring the fire over.
[292:14.97]Can I kill it?
[292:34.04]None of them landed on his head.
[292:35.02]That's kind of weird.
[292:41.68]BF bugleberries in chat.
[292:45.92]I can't.
[292:46.90]Oh, I can't believe it.
[292:55.33]Ooh, more purple.
[292:56.73]Purple.
[293:11.75]No fucking way.
[293:13.73]No way he's in chat.
[293:20.72]There's a buried treasure somewhere.
[293:22.00]I don't know where.
[293:27.78]Maybe we can recover all the energy in the radar room.
[293:31.54]When we find that radar, we'll find Dr. Bobby.
[293:35.48]Sorry.
[293:35.82]I'm so fucking high.
[293:39.58]Uh, are these guys fire?
[294:06.60]me too I'm not actually okay there is a treasure in here oh no how am I ever gonna get that
[294:33.45]Ask the blunt.
[294:35.97]I don't smoke marijuana.
[294:40.44]I mean, I do, but not really that often.
[294:44.22]Once in a blue moon.
[294:54.09]Let's get that skull.
[294:54.83]81.
[294:58.37]Let's go.
[295:03.43]Once an hour.
[295:03.95]Is that a bomb?
[295:14.52]Run, please.
[295:18.72]He didn't make it.
[295:20.22]He didn't make it.
[295:21.22]He tried.
[295:22.44]It's okay.
[295:25.97]Poor purple Pikmin number 25.
[295:37.47]So just to clarify again, it doesn't matter.
[295:39.47]They just have to be alive down here, right?
[295:40.93]I can just go in.
[295:44.44]Okay, cool.
[295:48.22]140.
[295:48.24]Am I almost halfway through the game?
[296:07.43]Is 10,000 the debt?
[296:10.95]After 10,000, that's not even close.
[296:15.89]Really?
[296:18.16]Oh, shit.
[296:18.70]Okay.
[296:23.30]Full debt is halfway.
[296:24.44]Oh, wow.
[296:25.00]Okay.
[296:27.10]Here we go.
[296:29.29]Final floor.
[296:33.85]Let's do this carefully.
[296:34.74]There's definitely a boss down here.
[296:41.72]Fire only.
[296:43.92]Snakes in here and shit.
[296:44.86]Hold on.
[296:45.14]Are they fire snakes?
[296:48.84]Are they fire snakes?
[296:59.35]It might be.
[297:04.20]This is the eyes.
[297:04.70]Oh, shit.
[297:09.76]Okay.
[297:10.76]People are gonna die.
[297:12.26]People are dead.
[297:12.94]Like, let's just be honest.
[297:17.00]What's the strategy here?
[297:21.07]Hmm.
[297:23.47]I want purples on... I want reds and purples...
[297:32.41]On Olimar.
[297:39.88]Or no, just purple on one.
[297:46.00]I want only red on Olimar so I can be, I can be okay.
[297:49.10]And that's what I'm doing.
[297:54.56]No.
[297:56.66]What do I want?
[297:57.08]That's it.
[298:02.51]Should I leave the other ones here?
[298:05.37]Maybe it's not even worth bringing them.
[298:13.41]Because aren't they just going to die?
[298:16.20]If it's a fire boss, then I feel like they're just going to die.
[298:19.16]Let's try it.
[298:20.80]Let's see what happens.
[298:21.40]Run.
[298:28.76]okay I don't know what he I don't know run run run run run just run out see what he does what does he do he's like a charge move or something probably charges he's kind of cute he's kind of cute and this music is so cute too I haven't seen anything it doesn't charge
[298:59.71]Oh, my God.
[299:01.53]Oh, my God.
[299:02.17]Don't scoop up enough like a whale with a school of fish.
[299:04.11]Okay, good.
[299:05.09]He has a big tongue.
[299:08.37]Where can we go?
[299:09.49]Oh, my God.
[299:10.17]Don't stand still.
[299:10.73]Don't go to his mouth.
[299:23.24]Everyone back up.
[299:23.82]Everybody back.
[299:26.62]Oh.
[299:43.09]Oh Megazord.
[299:58.49]It's fascinating.
[300:10.34]I still have... Oh, he killed so many.
[300:13.60]So many purples again.
[300:15.00]My purple friends.
[300:18.13]I'll replace him.
[300:23.55]It's alright.
[300:27.69]And there's a gate here.
[300:29.85]This is just a regular gate?
[300:32.11]There's more.
[300:33.59]I'm surprised there's more.
[300:38.61]Well, start working on that.
[300:46.87]It's a Megazord worth.
[300:50.09]That's it?
[300:50.65]I'm a boss?
[300:56.69]The material has perplexing properties.
[300:58.03]I will try fusing with the spare space suit.
[301:00.99]Health increase?
[301:04.28]I'd like to mention the Scorch Guard.
[301:08.46]Thanks to the heat resistant alloy, the suit is now impervious to fire.
[301:17.93]That's cool.
[301:28.40]The rest of you get over there.
[301:30.80]Got it.
[301:31.54]What's the point of the second part here?
[301:48.19]There's another treasure here, but where is it?
[301:54.75]Easy.
[301:57.45]I have to take fire guys with me.
[302:03.93]Wait, can I even do that?
[302:06.51]Um.
[302:16.28]I fell.
[302:35.84]Shit, I can't get that.
[302:39.66]Wait.
[302:39.80]Yeah I can.
[302:52.28]Follow me.
[302:59.41]Thank you.
[303:09.80]You know what to do.
[303:10.74]Take that out.
[303:19.97]Okay.
[303:21.73]Now can I?
[303:22.39]Now go get it.
[303:29.19]Come on.
[303:30.89]Two more.
[303:31.39]Three.
[303:31.72]Get up there.
[303:32.80]Get up there.
[303:33.16]Guys.
[303:38.00]Really?
[303:44.74]Okay.
[303:50.17]Get it!
[303:53.85]Oh.
[303:56.91]Alright, I'm immune to fire.
[304:12.37]Bring this shit.
[304:15.75]Don't go that way.
[304:16.39]Go this way.
[304:17.77]Thank you.
[304:19.15]Aha!
[304:20.57]I did it!
[304:30.92]Next time I play this, I'm definitely turning off the sound thing.
[304:37.67]If they went into the water, that would have been very bad.
[304:48.46]What's this one worth?
[304:54.79]It's cute.
[304:56.55]Well, my compressor is making it so you don't hear it all the time, but make no mistake.
[305:04.68]Yeah, it's just doing this forever.
[305:07.98]$2.50?
[305:08.00]Holy shit, nice.
[305:19.30]Turn it off in five seconds, press the home button.
[305:24.10]Yeah, but I think I'm going to start with that because then people will know that it's turned off and people will be very upset if I turn it off now, won't they?
[305:31.08]They'll be like, I wanted that.
[305:32.22]Why'd you get rid of that?
[305:33.06]If I start with that on Sunday, I'll just be like, hey, it's off.
[305:35.13]People will be like, oh, it's off.
[305:45.27]No one can... I know, I'm just kidding around.
[305:54.13]a lot of money today.
[305:57.23]1350.
[305:59.03]Cave complete.
[306:10.91]I think that's probably a good place to stop, too.
[306:18.24]After this day is over, I think this is a good place to stop.
[306:26.81]40% of debt recovered.
[306:30.90]What else can I do here today before the time runs out?
[306:35.06]Hmm.
[306:38.18]I'm not sure there is anything I can do.
[306:44.19]Did I get the blues?
[306:46.43]Wait, let me refill.
[306:46.95]Give me some more reds.
[306:58.72]Alright, 95 Pikmin.
[307:00.46]Let's go.
[307:02.74]Where's the blues?
[307:06.68]So if I go through here and around, blue is that way.
[307:09.60]Okay.
[307:22.87]Ooh, there's a yellow thing here too.
[307:26.65]Interesting.
[307:27.17]Okay.
[307:38.76]Where's it at?
[307:41.04]Wait.
[307:44.36]That's where I need to go.
[307:44.98]Okay, here's the plan.
[307:49.77]I'm going to throw you over here and then I'm going to run around the side.
[307:54.20]Everybody up.
[308:20.64]Painful?
[308:21.04]Wait, why?
[308:23.39]I wanted to bring everybody up here.
[308:39.56]Look there, a wild blue Pikmin are chasing prey near the water's edge.
[308:46.06]You can split up the captains.
[308:48.97]Oh yeah, that's right.
[308:52.71]This is why I heard the Pikmin 2 is like the worst one.
[308:54.43]It's like the whole splitting the captains thing.
[308:56.49]I heard that was like a reason why everyone didn't like this one.
[308:59.73]There's like 12 on Rotten Tomatoes.
[309:02.26]I get it now.
[309:02.72]I apologize.
[309:06.86]I was momentarily entranced by them.
[309:08.60]Now back to work.
[309:20.89]Bad angle.
[309:27.01]Oh yeah, I know this is like universally the most loved one.
[309:30.09]I know.
[309:30.39]That's the reason why I'm playing it right now.
[309:34.69]I would have started with one if that were not the case, right?
[309:46.75]Get away from the fence!
[309:47.77]What are you doing?
[309:49.72]Why would you do that?
[309:50.48]That was not smart.
[310:01.97]Oh, I guess fine.
[310:03.09]Go ahead.
[310:14.50]One's actually better, but don't tell anyone.
[310:16.10]But this is really good.
[310:20.02]This is very fun.
[310:22.08]I don't know how much more different the first one is.
[310:32.66]The time limit was really scary as a kid.
[310:34.12]It was scary as an adult too.
[310:36.00]Come on, you can get it.
[310:48.55]Come on, break it down.
[310:54.83]In Pikmin 1, you had 30 in-game days.
[310:56.97]That's it?
[310:57.35]Wow.
[310:59.71]Was his day like 6?
[311:02.63]I'm on like day six or seven and I don't even have the blue Pikmin yet.
[311:15.05]It's day nine, right?
[311:16.19]Okay.
[311:16.39]Yeah, I know it says it in the top right corner, but I am currently looking over at a chat room.
[311:25.12]I'm staring at the chat, reading what you guys are saying.
[311:31.38]Since I brought that up, I have been looking at the chat box.
[311:36.20]I don't have four sets of eyes.
[311:37.66]Alright, let's go.
[312:00.95]How do I do this?
[312:04.21]Wait, nobody move.
[312:06.65]Don't.
[312:07.61]Please.
[312:13.78]If I walk in the water, this is gonna die.
[312:22.66]You shit-eating dumb fuck.
[312:31.40]At last you have encountered them.
[312:32.72]They seem to have gill-like ducks on their cheeks.
[312:38.19]It must be Blue Pikmin.
[312:39.31]Like the other types, they look like they want to talk to you.
[312:45.27]He looks really fucked up right now.
[312:47.67]Alright, come to me over here.
[313:05.51]Deliver that.
[313:07.05]Deliver this.
[313:15.56]They're just like fighting these tadpoles.
[313:18.88]Not yet.
[313:19.24]We're not strong enough yet.
[313:22.52]Not yet, I said.
[313:23.96]Are you eating them out of the ground?
[313:26.22]Better not be.
[313:38.09]Kind of hard to see.
[313:43.93]Oh, fuck.
[313:47.46]Hurry up, come on.
[313:56.34]Hurry up.
[313:57.00]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[314:03.96]Get it, get it, get it.
[314:04.80]All five of you.
[314:05.82]All five of you pick it up.
[314:07.26]Get on it.
[314:16.07]Okay, that was really fun.
[314:19.83]Come on.
[314:20.03]Excuse me.
[314:20.29]Okay.
[314:20.39]We did it!
[314:21.11]Where's the other 100?
[314:23.48]Where are they?
[314:24.10]There's 20 somewhere.
[314:26.60]Where?
[314:27.30]Oh my god.
[314:50.03]They're at the other ship.
[314:57.12]No!
[314:57.56]Wiimote, please!
[314:58.30]Did I get it?
[314:59.14]I think I got it.
[315:12.97]I was trying to get the motion over there all the way to the edge.
[315:19.47]I skipped it.
[315:19.89]I didn't even mean to.
[315:21.88]They're fine.
[315:22.26]They're at the base.
[315:22.86]Okay, cool.
[315:26.32]Game is stressful.
[315:27.48]I made a lot of money.
[315:42.51]Who died?
[315:43.05]A lot of purples died.
[315:48.10]Yeah, 34 died today.
[315:48.98]Three died from like one from explosion.
[315:51.34]Alright in the cave.
[315:59.69]You made it stressful by sitting at the gate all day.
[316:05.15]It's all good though.
[316:07.87]It's all good.
[316:12.81]Almost 5000 out of 10,000 cool.
[316:13.57]So now that I have water.
[316:19.25]I can do most of the shit over here.
[316:22.71]That'll be for another day.
[316:31.86]So I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[316:33.60]I ran into the unfortunate problem of I was supposed to stream yesterday, but the Twitch servers had problems.
[316:40.98]So I have something I have to take care of tomorrow.
[316:43.14]I have things, I have some errands I have to run, but I'll be live on Sunday.
[316:51.23]We will continue Pikmin 2.
[316:52.71]It's really fun.
[316:53.55]I like it.
[316:53.87]It's a really good game.
[316:59.89]And we will pull the stream back on Sunday as well.
[317:03.43]So we're not going to start at 4.30 Pacific on Sunday.
[317:07.85]We're likely to start somewhere around.
[317:09.57]Let's see.
[317:13.99]Somewhere around 1 p.m.
[317:15.31]Pacific.
[317:22.61]Hold it back by a few hours or so.
[317:28.27]So, that's it.
[317:28.89]I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[317:30.15]Have a wonderful rest of your day.
[317:32.03]Rest of your night.
[317:33.51]Sorry we couldn't stream yesterday.
[317:36.37]But, you know, sometimes shit happens, right?
[317:44.79]I like it.
[317:46.03]I can't promise that I will beat Pikmin 2.
[317:48.99]Because if what you're telling me is true and the game's like 30 to 40 hours long,
[317:54.01]We might do it one or two more times and see how far we get.
[317:57.65]We'll see.
[317:58.81]If I still am having fun, I'm still going to play it.
[318:03.35]He's not going to beat it.
[318:04.77]I don't know.
[318:05.05]We'll see.
[318:06.87]Any news on Bionicle?
[318:08.03]No.
[318:09.05]The only news that I can share with you is there will be an archaeologist stream in the next 30 days.
[318:14.79]It's the only news I have for you right now.
[318:22.80]Let's do a raid.
[318:25.21]Let's see who's live right now.
[318:27.44]Let's go to... Oh, let's go to Joel.
[318:37.35]Joel's playing Super Straight Fighter.
[318:38.95]It's Fightcade Friday.
[318:40.59]Sounds like fun.
[318:54.84]Thanks for all the subs, everybody.
[318:59.27]This list is extreme every single day that I stream.
[319:07.41]This list is just... This is a... We essentially have filled an entire guest list of people at a fucking party.
[319:17.19]A concert.
[319:20.89]Thank you, everybody.
[319:24.44]Go say hello to Joel.
[319:29.18]This party sucks.
[319:43.67]We'll see you soon though.
[319:44.39]See you on Sunday.
[319:45.85]Around 1 o'clock Pacific.
[319:47.41]Thanks for watching as always.
[319:49.21]Have a great night.
[319:50.77]I'll catch you guys soon.
[319:52.53]Thanks for hanging out.
[319:59.79]Good night and goodbye.
