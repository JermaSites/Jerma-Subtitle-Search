[00:01.21]I am not late at all.
[00:07.67]I am precisely on time.
[00:09.77]Precisely with a really fucked up voice.
[00:12.53]As per usual.
[00:15.11]Hi.
[00:15.93]How are you?
[00:17.69]That was the first part of your week, Ben.
[00:19.44]Hopefully it's been pretty good.
[00:21.94]How was your Monday?
[00:22.80]How was your Tuesday?
[00:24.94]How was your... Wait, it's not Wednesday.
[00:28.16]That whole joke got ruined.
[00:30.02]Wow.
[00:32.93]I was gonna... Hold on, let's try that again.
[00:35.24]How was your... I already saw you on Wednesday, so let's do this again.
[00:39.76]How was your Thursday?
[00:40.92]How was your Friday?
[00:42.32]How was your Saturday?
[00:43.60]How was your... Ah!
[00:44.98]We don't know yet.
[00:45.58]We'll find out soon enough.
[00:47.43]Hopefully, we can have a good Sunday together.
[00:49.81]I actually thought it was Wednesday.
[00:52.35]Hello!
[00:52.67]Hello!
[00:54.86]That's the streamer mindset.
[00:56.34]It wasn't even a joke.
[00:57.20]It was me just doing a little thing.
[00:59.29]You should be laughing because I don't know what day it is.
[01:02.07]And not only do I not know what day it is, I was way off.
[01:05.75]Way off.
[01:06.79]Like, not even remotely close.
[01:09.33]That's what you should be yellow-elling in the chat about.
[01:11.74]Not, you know, anything else.
[01:14.06]My voice sucks.
[01:14.82]I couldn't even do yellow-ell correctly.
[01:16.62]Do you hear this?
[01:17.14]I don't know what's wrong with me.
[01:19.94]I don't get it.
[01:20.44]Are there any doctors in here?
[01:25.97]I went to the doctor about, like, having, like, a junky voice and, like, a junky, like, painful kind of nose, and I was getting dizzy and shit.
[01:31.89]I go to the doctor.
[01:32.94]They put that camera tube up my nose.
[01:34.94]They do an MRI of my head and the brain and shit, and they go, oh, no, you just have, like, cysts all over inside of your, uh, mucus cavities.
[01:40.94]I mean, they can cause those problems, but, nah, that's not what's happening.
[01:45.34]Take them out!
[01:46.23]Take them out now!
[01:47.51]Get rid of them!
[01:48.13]I don't want them anymore!
[01:54.67]Anyways.
[01:59.60]We're doing just fine.
[02:04.13]Oh, they like it in there.
[02:10.35]You can't just take them out.
[02:11.59]No, I mean, I can get them.
[02:12.89]I can get surgery.
[02:14.35]It's so stupid, like... I almost look forward to when we're all just machines.
[02:20.10]Like, okay, keep our brains and keep our hearts because that's important.
[02:25.82]But honestly...
[02:28.54]Ah, Mr. Elbertson, you've got a hernia.
[02:30.06]We're gonna have to fucking cut into you and cut all the flesh and shit and put all the mucous membranes and then like pull it out because it's stuck there and then, you know, that could be why your whole body hurts.
[02:39.75]Oh, okay.
[02:40.75]Mr. Elbertson, do you have cysts in your nose and they're growing and they're huge and they're ugly and we need to cut them out with scissors?
[02:47.90]Whatever the hell they do.
[02:51.07]We need to be made out of steel and platinum and gold.
[02:55.75]None of this flesh bullshit.
[02:57.41]It's stupid.
[02:57.99]It gets in the way.
[02:58.77]That was a big true.
[03:04.56]Somebody said that right now.
[03:12.60]I'm just kidding.
[03:13.42]My God.
[03:15.02]Can I not go off on these comedy rants anymore?
[03:20.63]But honest to God, yeah, I don't know why.
[03:21.83]You probably notice it every so often.
[03:23.85]The last 6 to 12 months.
[03:27.11]I gotta figure out what I want to do about it.
[03:30.18]My vocal cords are fine.
[03:31.92]They've looked at those.
[03:33.12]It's just something going on up in where those cysts are that I'm just gonna have to get them taken out.
[03:39.80]But from... Wait, I'm not gonna announce it yet.
[03:42.74]Hold on.
[03:43.64]Hold on.
[03:43.92]We gotta wait for people to trickle in.
[03:48.82]What did you say?
[03:50.94]Would you let raccoons do surgery on you?
[03:53.62]Does the raccoon have a degree in surgery?
[03:56.56]Because yes, if that's the case.
[03:58.98]If a raccoon can get through med school and get a degree in surgery, then why wouldn't you?
[04:03.73]I mean, they let Rocket Raccoon build a bunch of spaceships.
[04:09.67]You don't think that he could, if he wanted to, become a doctor or something?
[04:24.07]What about a frog?
[04:24.77]Would you let a frog do surgery?
[04:26.21]Again, if the frog went through med school, what do I care?
[04:31.24]Their hands are too slippery.
[04:40.32]But they somehow got through med school and got through surgery school.
[04:44.91]Take it with gloves.
[04:49.43]Would you do surgery on yourself?
[04:54.31]No.
[04:55.11]Because looking down, you can't really see that well.
[04:58.31]Somebody would need to be doing it, like, on top of me, right?
[05:00.63]Like, cut in the middle.
[05:02.61]You can't look down and, like, do that.
[05:05.89]That's not going to happen.
[05:08.08]He's a mirror.
[05:14.62]Cameras exist.
[05:15.38]But you're referencing a ludicrous statement.
[05:23.46]I need another coffee.
[05:24.64]It's like a two or three coffee day.
[05:25.96]Because I'll tell you.
[05:27.61]I've got a major announcement for you.
[05:30.71]And I'm going to pull back the jokiness because I'm actually going to talk about a lot of serious things here.
[05:39.03]But should I wait until there's like a ton of people here?
[05:41.52]Or should I do this in the intro?
[05:46.26]Maybe I'll wait.
[05:46.88]Let's wait for a little bit because I feel like it's important enough to talk about and not like put on the jokey YouTube voice.
[05:54.22]I'll talk to you as me, my real voice.
[05:57.44]That's how you know that we're getting serious.
[05:59.54]When I start talking like this.
[06:01.34]So... No more jokey, uh, voice.
[06:04.66]This is my real voice.
[06:05.54]This is how I actually talk.
[06:10.57]You're at 10k now.
[06:12.39]It's not enough!
[06:14.35]I'm in a weird mood today.
[06:17.95]I'm sorry.
[06:18.33]I just, like, screamed at you.
[06:20.34]It's not an... Alright, just hold on.
[06:29.93]I'm really excited today, okay?
[06:32.53]I'm sorry.
[06:36.96]The compressor just fought with you.
[06:38.36]Wait, did it like screw that up?
[06:44.20]Do AI dungeon.
[06:45.30]We're going to do a house builder first because it popped up.
[06:49.27]I had a plan to play AI dungeon and novel AI today.
[06:54.55]And that's what I told everybody I was going to do.
[06:56.05]Everybody was aware of that.
[06:59.26]Last second, I saw a pop-up for house builder.
[07:02.84]So I changed every single one of my plans.
[07:05.90]That's what we're doing.
[07:08.28]It's still available though.
[07:09.03]We can still play it.
[07:09.95]It's ready to go.
[07:13.69]People were saying that I shouldn't play AI dungeon.
[07:15.23]I should play novel AI.
[07:16.33]This AI dungeon got... It got like nerfed or something.
[07:21.50]Like they gutted out some of the AI or something like that.
[07:23.88]I don't know.
[07:29.12]But AI Dungeon has kind of the quest thing, right?
[07:33.06]I'll try.
[07:33.52]We'll do them both.
[07:34.24]Doesn't matter.
[07:41.71]Why is your mouse squeaking?
[07:44.77]What?
[07:45.21]Wait, what do you mean my mouse squeaking?
[07:46.77]What do you mean?
[07:47.15]It was getting too expensive to run, so they had... Yeah, I mean...
[07:53.55]I mean, look, GeoGuessr is, you have to pay for it now, too.
[07:57.33]Right?
[07:57.93]This... It's not that expensive.
[08:00.49]It's... Look.
[08:03.03]If... If, like, GeoGuessr, like, a few dollars or something to play it... Is it gonna support the people that make the game and support it and keep it running?
[08:11.06]Whatever.
[08:11.38]That's cool.
[08:11.76]That's fine.
[08:19.64]As long as it doesn't ever become, like, actually pay to, like, win.
[08:29.53]GeoGuessr is cheaper than subbing here.
[08:31.61]Yes, it is.
[08:37.78]Yeah, I got them both.
[08:40.84]Pay to win Google Maps.
[08:45.10]Alright.
[08:46.20]Alright.
[08:46.72]It's time to mute the music.
[08:47.64]It's time for the music to stop.
[08:51.66]I need to say something.
[08:52.32]I need to talk about something.
[08:53.24]I got to get this like other music out of my ear because I want to talk to you guys very much to you.
[09:00.72]This has nothing to do, by the way, with the Discord changes.
[09:03.86]This is a completely separate thing that I'm announcing.
[09:06.72]So it's not like I didn't plan on having like a bunch of huge Discord changes and then like, and by the way, here we go.
[09:12.97]That just kind of happened this way.
[09:16.19]Tell a fart joke.
[09:17.45]I'll tell a fart joke in the middle of this announcement to ruin it.
[09:20.11]How does that sound?
[09:23.39]How does that sound?
[09:30.29]Okay, why won't this record?
[09:31.03]Alright, my GoXLR won't record it, so never mind.
[09:35.53]Alright, here we go.
[09:36.91]No more stalling, no more delaying.
[09:38.53]This is what I want to tell you.
[09:41.65]And we're going to talk about it for a little bit, so if you thought you were going to go right into House Builder, I got some news for you.
[09:47.48]You got about five to ten minutes sitting here looking at this starting soon screen.
[09:51.66]Maybe not.
[09:52.14]Maybe a little bit less.
[09:53.33]We can just sit on the menu, too.
[09:54.67]That's fine.
[09:56.87]Yeah, that's fine.
[10:00.59]So, what is the... Five minutes is... Okay.
[10:04.62]Okay.
[10:06.39]So as you know, those of you that have been on this channel for a long time, some of you for more than a decade, which is crazy, you'll know that sometimes I do very large streams.
[10:17.75]Whether that's Dollhouse, whether that's the Halloween stream, Bugleberry shows up sometimes.
[10:22.86]He's a good friend of mine, by the way.
[10:24.24]Good friend of mine.
[10:26.48]Baseball, other stuff that I really want to do...
[10:29.93]It's starting... The bills are starting to add up.
[10:34.00]And... Over the next kind of arc of... My career here... Which, I'll be honest... I kind of want to make this like THE... Like THE big one.
[10:46.88]What is happening now... Is I've decided... Going back and forth and talking with various people and various things... I am now signed with Evolved.
[10:57.83]I'm now under the Evolved umbrella...
[11:02.82]Evolved is the company that represents XQC in a talent agency way.
[11:10.52]Also, Cutie Cinderella.
[11:11.52]I think Austin Show.
[11:14.32]And a shitload of esports players, right?
[11:17.64]So why, why, why are you doing this?
[11:19.88]Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh, wait a minute.
[11:21.68]This dude's now all of a sudden he's like signed with a talent agency.
[11:24.34]He blew up his Discord.
[11:26.82]And like now what the fuck?
[11:28.25]Corporate AND is taking over.
[11:29.63]Is that what's happening?
[11:30.45]No, just wait.
[11:31.77]Everybody settle down.
[11:34.11]Settle down.
[11:37.33]I want to make this really clear.
[11:40.95]He's becoming a CSGO pro.
[11:43.69]What if that was the announcement?
[11:53.85]No, that would be so dumb.
[11:56.25]That would be such a bad, dumb move for me.
[11:58.87]Because I don't play CSGO and I'm not very good.
[12:00.87]I would be stuck... What's below bronze?
[12:04.37]Is there a wood?
[12:07.10]Like, I would be wood rank in League of Legends, whatever it is.
[12:14.00]Plastic.
[12:16.96]So, essentially what this means...
[12:20.50]is that there's going to be a lot of opportunities now to tap into potential sponsorships and brands and money and making money from these different avenues and stuff, right?
[12:34.61]But I've got to be really clear about this.
[12:37.94]The big shows cost a lot of money.
[12:40.25]And we struggled.
[12:41.71]I was actually thinking about having Jake, Community Jake, come on here and talk about this with me because he's a lot more well-spoken than I am in a lot of things.
[12:49.95]But I'll be very transparent with you guys.
[12:55.66]The streams that you see from time to time, they rack up and have racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in bills over the last few years.
[13:06.60]Dollhouse alone was an unbelievable amount of money.
[13:12.62]And I have to start to think about, as I go into this kind of, this arc of my online entertainment life, or whatever you want to call it, e-clown world, I have to start to be able to pay for these things.
[13:25.67]And could I maybe pay for them?
[13:27.47]Oh, I probably could.
[13:28.91]It would be pretty bad, though.
[13:30.81]I think over another few years of doing this, it might actually not be a good thing.
[13:36.26]So I'm opening the idea of being able to have a bigger dialogue with sponsors, be signed with a talent agency so they can handle this shit.
[13:45.99]They come to me, they say, hey, dude, you want to do, for instance... You guys are... I've talked about it a thousand times, so I'm just going to talk about it again.
[13:55.42]I want to do...
[13:57.73]Jerma Rumble Live on Twitch, right?
[14:01.23]I want to do Jerma Rumble Live live.
[14:04.21]And that show is going to be an absolute metric fucking huge amount of money.
[14:10.67]To be able to do stuff like that, I need to have the capital to be able to do it.
[14:16.43]And I'm going to only take sponsorships and only take money from places that I know that I'll have control.
[14:22.59]Streams are not going to change.
[14:24.07]I'm not going to do, like, fucking, like, laundry detergent tweets once a week.
[14:30.90]That's not happening.
[14:32.60]Guys, I tweet, like, five times a fucking year anyways.
[14:35.90]Who wants me to do tweets for their business?
[14:39.94]But I have to start to think about this stuff and I have to really start to take into consideration that there are companies that their whole goal is to make you money for stuff and sponsorships and bring brands in.
[14:54.18]It was a painful experience to get the dollhouse paid for.
[14:57.96]A lot of behind the scenes stuff you guys don't know about that show.
[15:00.86]That was very, very, very difficult to have happen.
[15:04.65]I want to try to eliminate that.
[15:10.27]I want to make it easier on production, on people that are showing up, on myself, to not have to kind of drag their heels into the ground trying to figure out how we're going to pay for a show.
[15:23.80]And some of you might be saying, right?
[15:26.18]Maybe not some of you.
[15:27.26]Maybe I'm just making you up, but that's fine.
[15:28.54]I want to say this anyways.
[15:30.86]Well, then what?
[15:31.42]Just don't do the shows.
[15:33.18]Just don't do the big shows.
[15:34.92]If they're this much of a financial kind of burden in a lot of ways, don't do them.
[15:38.95]Just don't do them.
[15:40.82]uh we we don't need them I have to be very honest with you if I wasn't doing the big shows I would have quit two or three years ago I would have retired years ago and I made a very very important statement over the last three or four years the if I'm not interested I'm not gonna stay
[16:04.90]yeah the the the replacement stream joke that was that was a joke but you know I have to really think about how I'm going to stay interested and that is what interests me doing like Jerma rumble live is what I am interested in doing doing baseball is what keeps me interested
[16:28.39]And if these things weren't here and I wasn't actively on a daily, weekly basis trying to get these shows off the ground, I probably would have stopped.
[16:40.58]He actually hates streaming.
[16:44.56]He actually hates.
[16:46.10]No, that's not what I'm saying.
[16:47.96]No, I love streaming.
[16:49.78]What are you talking about?
[16:51.31]You would have seen the shows, the projects, the events.
[16:55.21]That's what I live for right now, right?
[17:01.07]But this stuff has to get paid for.
[17:02.35]And especially if I want to do them as more often, like you've been seeing.
[17:06.27]It's been pretty much every, what, like three or four months, every like few months, there's like something that's not like, just like kind of sitting in a, at like a desk stream.
[17:15.54]Right.
[17:17.20]So what Evolved is going to do is they're going to come in and they're going to connect me to brands and to people that, Hey, you know what?
[17:24.68]Uh, yeah, that stream that you want to do sounds like really fun and really cool.
[17:28.73]We'll give you money for it.
[17:30.83]That's the whole purpose of this.
[17:33.47]And I know I said it was going to be five minutes and I know it's been like 15, but also let me make, I'm going to give you some hard lines here for you to understand.
[17:48.45]If I will not have complete direct control over everything, I will not take a sponsor.
[17:57.44]A lot of people, when they saw the Coinbase sponsor, they thought that it was like, holy shit, oh my god, the stream is ruined.
[18:05.16]He's going to be shilling coins and NFTs.
[18:08.67]That's not going to happen.
[18:09.85]That is not going to happen.
[18:11.93]Let me be very clear with everybody.
[18:13.55]That is not ever going to happen.
[18:17.33]if I do not have exact direct control over everything, it's not happening.
[18:22.65]I'll say no thank you.
[18:28.05]So that's where that stands.
[18:30.93]If you see a sponsor on this channel over the coming months, it's because of a few reasons.
[18:36.74]Reason number one.
[18:38.22]Fuck it.
[18:38.90]Cha-ching!
[18:40.40]Reason number two.
[18:42.82]Um... What was it?
[18:46.91]Oh, um, paying for shows!
[18:48.79]No, I mean, I'm just fucking around, but seriously.
[18:51.45]Reason number one, and pretty much the only reason, is to make money to pay for the big stuff.
[18:59.04]And the big stuff is very expensive.
[19:02.58]I'm not trying to make a shitload of money from sponsors to take and put in my personal bank account.
[19:09.20]I want to pay for shows.
[19:10.62]I want to be able to pay the people on the shows and be able to do them without stressing myself out financially.
[19:16.85]Or sitting there in the middle of like our dollhouse production going, okay, we fucking need money or this isn't happening.
[19:25.04]I want that to not happen ever again.
[19:31.12]So I think that it's a good fit.
[19:35.16]And we'll see.
[19:36.18]Going forward, it's going to be, it's going to see how much I like it.
[19:41.91]I'm very, very happy with what they've said so far.
[19:45.21]And hopefully the relationship, like in a business wise, can flourish and evolved, can come in and help out this channel.
[19:52.75]And you guys will see what they do.
[19:59.99]Also, I know, five minutes, I know.
[20:03.38]Another important thing to understand is if I'm going to do a huge show that's going to cost tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars,
[20:14.53]I don't want that to be a financial burden on the community, right?
[20:18.75]Like, I don't want to have to be like, oh, shit, well, I really should, like, really need some more subs this month.
[20:24.37]Otherwise, it's going to be hard to do the playground stream.
[20:29.93]We get a bunch of playground equipment, and we do, like, Olympic-level playground equipment competitions, right?
[20:37.46]That's not happening.
[20:38.20]I just made that up.
[20:39.99]But that's my, you know what I mean?
[20:41.29]Like, I don't want to have to, I would rather it be a sponsor comes in, drops a bunch of money, and it's, I don't have, it's not like the burden is not put on either me or me needing to kind of tell everybody, hey, you know, so, like, I need, like, can you guys get me to, like, fucking 20k?
[20:56.66]No.
[20:57.30]Because I don't want to do that.
[21:02.88]And I've never, ever, this is five minute Andy.
[21:07.53]The only time that a stream or a YouTube video really has ever been sponsored has been Dollhouse.
[21:14.74]I never really have ever done a sponsorship.
[21:16.76]Maybe one back in the YouTube days.
[21:19.54]I don't even remember it's been so long.
[21:21.83]But all the major streams that you see...
[21:24.61]All the major videos.
[21:25.57]Guys, I... I liquidated my 401k to make the Jerma Rumble video.
[21:34.05]That's a story you've heard many times.
[21:37.51]So...
[21:39.22]It's not... I need to start to think about who is going to pay for these things.
[21:44.76]And if it's going to be me, you know, who knows?
[21:47.48]Maybe I'm not brand friendly.
[21:50.11]We'll find the right brands, right?
[21:53.47]There's tons of companies that I've talked really highly of.
[21:59.11]We won't know who is going to.
[22:02.37]He says fuck all the time.
[22:10.17]But you know, there's a lot of opportunity.
[22:13.39]I just don't want people to think that this is now... Oh, he's cashing out.
[22:18.41]He's getting kind of the end of his career, so he's putting all the chips on the table.
[22:23.09]Hey, fuck this whole thing.
[22:24.69]I'm pulling out all this money.
[22:26.35]No, that's not happening.
[22:28.95]I just want to be able to pay for shows.
[22:31.54]And however we can do that, if I need to do some sponsorships, if you see it here and there, that's what's going to happen.
[22:36.66]I'm going to make sure it's stuff that I really want to do, though.
[22:41.60]Which makes, hey, excuse me, all advertisers, excuse me, all advertisers, please pay attention.
[22:48.06]Don't you think that makes this channel way more fucking valuable?
[22:52.35]Wait, he's only had, wait, he's only had one sponsor ever?
[22:57.69]Oh my, we can get on there.
[22:59.39]Give him 10 million, give him 20 million, give him 30 million, right?
[23:03.57]Like, that's pretty valuable.
[23:11.09]20 million dollars no He's so fucked up But I'm only gonna start today I'm gonna take sponsor some things that I really want to take sponsors from and I'm gonna have control and Evolved has been very very upfront.
[23:27.92]They said dude we get it this music.
[23:30.96]This has been the music that's been on the whole time What is this like church music
[23:38.66]Oh my god, turn that off.
[23:40.62]It's not bad.
[23:41.62]It's like nice.
[23:42.61]It's nice music, but I feel like, okay.
[23:46.65]He says he's gonna use it for big shows.
[23:49.35]He's gonna use it to pay.
[23:50.49]No.
[23:52.01]This is televangelist inspirational bullshit.
[23:59.86]It really does feel like I'm a televangelist.
[24:02.86]I am asking you, I am talking about money and where money is going to come from to the church, to the congregation.
[24:10.64]You know, I'm sorry, everybody.
[24:13.32]What I have to start to think about here is how we're going to make the church grow even bigger than it is now.
[24:20.52]And we do that by talking about this company here, as you see.
[24:25.44]I don't want to make a joke about a sponsor because I'm like sponsor Andy now, right?
[24:30.86]Oh, that's off limits.
[24:31.74]Can't talk about that.
[24:32.80]Can't bring up this company just in case they're ever interested.
[24:35.54]People are like, okay, what Evolve doesn't know.
[24:40.47]Shh, don't tell them.
[24:42.91]What they don't know is like they're going to come to me with sponsor people.
[24:47.75]Hey, we got this deal for you.
[24:48.93]Maybe it'll make you a really good amount of money.
[24:50.85]You can take this and then like, oh, that show in fucking June is going to be awesome.
[24:54.51]Okay, sure.
[24:56.01]What was the company again?
[24:57.83]Oh, let me give you a list of all the companies that are interested.
[25:01.31]Okay, well, I told that company that they suck.
[25:04.63]I told that company to fuck off.
[25:05.77]I said, fuck that company.
[25:07.14]I said, this company makes disgusting dog shit products.
[25:10.68]I can't use any of these.
[25:15.64]Wait, what?
[25:17.54]Yeah, unless you're coming at me with like Hamburger Helper or like McDonald's.
[25:22.85]Those are the only two companies I've ever spoken highly of.
[25:26.52]like no other companies have ever talked highly of maybe like jet blue well there you go this is your criteria hamburger helper fuel and chucky cheese please don't do nft guys I okay turn the funny music off let me just be really clear yes
[25:50.66]You guys know that I've had the Coinbase sponsor.
[25:52.98]Yes, I've been involved in crypto over the years.
[25:56.26]You understand that, right?
[25:57.90]But I'm not going to do that.
[25:59.50]I'm not going to jump into the NFT game now that I have a sponsorship.
[26:04.65]That's not going to happen.
[26:06.25]I'm not going to do that.
[26:07.75]I have no interest in NFTs.
[26:09.83]I don't care about them.
[26:10.91]I don't focus on them at all.
[26:12.53]It's nothing that I care about.
[26:15.07]I have no interest at all.
[26:18.86]So I got to make that because people are probably going to think that like if I tell, oh, he's going to start taking sponsorships.
[26:24.00]He wants to take big money sponsorships.
[26:25.74]He took a Coinbase sponsorship.
[26:28.48]No, I am in control of what I want to do.
[26:31.65]And I have no interest in that space at all.
[26:33.73]I just don't.
[26:37.11]So I've seen that pop up in chat a little bit.
[26:40.79]And I want to make sure that people understand that.
[26:49.91]Is it true?
[26:50.91]What about Subway?
[26:52.01]I mean, have I talked?
[26:53.51]Okay, you guys have to do me a favor here.
[26:55.63]Well, I mean, we need to kind of come up with all the companies that I've spoken highly of, right?
[27:01.10]Imagine being like a brand person for one of these companies and you go to this, you pay a bunch of money to have this like streamer do this shit.
[27:08.98]And somebody links you a clip of them like taking a bite of your most famous sandwich and saying this is dog shit into the camera.
[27:20.89]Alright, alright, I know, I know, I've been sitting here for like 20 minutes, but it's important though too, right?
[27:26.12]And I want to touch upon the Discord stuff as well, because I've seen a lot of people kind of talk about what the fuck is happening on the Discord.
[27:35.31]I need to start to get some of these places more manageable for me.
[27:39.19]And over the last few months, I've been trying to figure out how to do that.
[27:44.09]How to make the Discord the cleaner experience for me.
[27:46.34]Better for the mods.
[27:47.56]Better for me to manage.
[27:49.00]Because at the end of the day, it's the Jerma985 official Discord, which the buck stops at my desk.
[27:56.45]And I kind of have to see how things go there.
[27:59.09]We've seen problems there.
[28:00.21]We've seen great, incredible things come from that space, right?
[28:04.17]I have to try to get it to where I can pay attention to it, to where I can manage it.
[28:09.11]Have a group of mods that can manage it with me.
[28:11.65]You're gonna get TV burnin'.
[28:15.93]Look, there's a few important things going on.
[28:18.53]And no, I'm sorry.
[28:19.67]There's like little sparkles going on over here.
[28:22.51]So it's gonna be fine.
[28:23.57]It's not gonna burn into my monitor.
[28:28.25]But as this channel kind of changes, and as this channel evolves, there'll be some things you'll see that are changing.
[28:38.94]And like I said, I'm trying to keep myself interested.
[28:41.94]I'm trying to keep myself connected to the space as best as I can.
[28:45.34]You can't minus to the new agency that assigned me.
[28:48.26]That's not how it works.
[28:52.45]But as we go forward here,
[28:55.39]I need to find ways to make it so I can disconnect.
[28:58.18]Because you guys have known this for the last almost 11 plus years of being around.
[29:04.53]I disconnect.
[29:05.87]I don't interact that much.
[29:07.25]And that's very much by design.
[29:10.20]I need to disconnect, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to do it for this long.
[29:15.00]The constant kind of stress and the constant awareness of having a community this big is- my way of handling it is to not- to really disconnect from it a lot of times.
[29:29.31]And, I mean, like I said, I don't tweet that much.
[29:31.07]I'm not on social media that much.
[29:32.73]So in the spaces that I'm, you know, officially a part of, that I officially own,
[29:37.64]Going forward, here too, not just on Discord, on Twitch, on, you know, the YouTube space, on, like, the sponsor space.
[29:45.19]I gotta get it under control, because I'm not really that much of a participant.
[29:50.89]Please play, dude, the edibles are kicking in.
[29:54.01]Oh, shit, that guy, that dude, alright, that one guy was, like, ready for House Builder, and is pissed.
[30:02.20]Because we've been sitting here for 25 plus minutes.
[30:05.46]Talking about like the state of the channel and the community and shit.
[30:09.08]And this guy is sitting here sinking into his couch.
[30:12.33]And like starting to, the world is zoning out.
[30:15.55]And he's sitting there going, please pick up the fucking cement truck and just dump the cement dude.
[30:20.15]This is too much for my fucking brain.
[30:23.51]What do you got, what do you mean Italian?
[30:25.05]He's evolving?
[30:26.69]No, I don't want an evolved version of this fucking weirdo.
[30:29.70]No, no, I'm leaving the community.
[30:31.93]I just, that person just left the community.
[30:34.81]That person thinks I'm, like, turning into, like, a new Pokémon or something.
[30:37.55]Like, I just fucked up.
[30:38.29]Alright.
[30:40.33]TL;DR.
[30:42.14]Sponsorships are gonna become a thing now.
[30:43.96]I wanna pay for big streams.
[30:45.52]Some of the biggest streams I've ever done, even more large in scale than the dollhouse, are currently underway.
[30:53.71]I'm gotta, I gotta believe!
[30:58.13]Alright, let's go.
[31:01.49]All the things that I'm doing are trying to make my life a little easier.
[31:05.98]That's it.
[31:07.44]Okay?
[31:10.12]You fucking criticize me.
[31:12.42]You're gone.
[31:13.74]I will ban you fucking permanently with the click of one of my fucking fingers.
[31:19.44]So watch it.
[31:20.04]Okay.
[31:28.42]Alright, House Builder.
[31:29.44]This is not like House Flipper.
[31:31.32]It's different.
[31:31.84]You build the houses rather than flip them.
[31:34.80]This game might be dog.
[31:37.99]You know what?
[31:39.89]We're turning over a new leaf.
[31:41.05]Because at some point, you know, you can't just say that about anything that I come across.
[31:45.97]Corporate Andy.
[31:46.97]Let's go.
[31:47.29]Alright, we're gonna start.
[31:50.95]I think you start small.
[31:53.57]You can't say anything bad about anyone anymore.
[31:55.85]Ha ha ha.
[31:57.69]No, hey, hey Evolved, I'll give you a list, okay?
[32:00.04]I'll give you a nice list.
[32:04.54]This is an igloo house, it's easy.
[32:09.90]This is a mud house, and it's easy.
[32:11.43]Hmm.
[32:13.07]It's the only two I can do.
[32:16.21]And now let's put on that YouTuber voice.
[32:17.57]Should I have a face cam?
[32:20.15]No, maybe in a minute.
[32:21.71]Maybe if you're good.
[32:24.06]The igloo?
[32:25.50]Alright, we gotta learn how to play.
[32:29.70]How about instead of a house, we build a home?
[32:33.60]Time that person out for 30 minutes.
[32:42.85]Good to see you, builder.
[32:43.69]I hope the weather won't scare you off.
[32:45.41]Let's be honest, that's a tough job.
[32:48.93]As you probably know, we build all around the world.
[32:51.33]You might expect bigger buildings, more mechanics, and construction challenges in the future.
[32:55.24]But for now, let's see how you handle it.
[32:57.96]Have fun.
[33:00.95]A little loud for me, but it's probably not loud for you, is it?
[33:06.34]Oh, we have a dog.
[33:06.86]Can we pet the dog?
[33:07.38]I mean, kind of.
[33:12.10]To start building the igloo, you must first cut out ice blocks.
[33:17.21]What?
[33:17.55]To do this, grab the highlighted bone knife and come near the ice quarry and while holding the left mouse button, draw a contour along the scratch on the ice.
[33:29.06]What?
[33:29.18]What?
[33:32.37]That just jump scared me.
[33:34.43]Okay, snow bricks.
[33:39.75]What?
[33:40.09]Okay, so pick up the ice block.
[33:47.89]Oh!
[33:49.07]Pick up the knife.
[33:52.68]Oh, there's a knife.
[33:53.22]Is this like a melee weapon?
[33:58.42]Get closer to the source of ice.
[34:03.20]Is this the source of ice?
[34:06.48]I mean, isn't ice just literally surrounding us?
[34:08.38]It's so bright.
[34:11.28]It's so bright.
[34:12.51]I think I'm going to need to put on some HD glasses.
[34:15.71]Some brightness-reducing glasses.
[34:18.33]Thankfully, I'm open to sponsorships now.
[34:21.09]I wonder what kind I would put on.
[34:23.65]I wonder what brand I would be using.
[34:26.53]God, I really need them now.
[34:29.01]Bone igloo knife.
[34:31.48]Before you start, you'll have to find an igloo bone knife.
[34:33.98]Press E to grab it.
[34:34.68]Okay.
[34:35.82]If you already have a knife in your hands, draw a contour along the visible track on the ice while holding left.
[34:42.60]When you see there's no more ice on the hole, you have to look for another source.
[34:45.22]What?
[34:45.58]Over here?
[34:52.05]Whoa!
[34:55.49]Whoa!
[35:00.96]Oh, shit.
[35:01.54]Okay, cool.
[35:05.35]New skill available.
[35:08.41]Oh, my God.
[35:09.53]This is like the Path of Exile skill tree.
[35:16.57]This is bigger than Path of Exile.
[35:20.18]Let me see.
[35:20.44]This isn't accurate at all.
[35:22.22]You know what else isn't accurate at all?
[35:24.00]Not... Well, I was going to say not... I thought I didn't have gloves on.
[35:27.04]Never mind.
[35:27.80]Joke ruined.
[35:30.72]With this skill, you will cut two times more snow blocks at the same time.
[35:35.71]Okay, got it.
[35:36.91]Two times more snow blocks.
[35:43.15]Cut ice for the new snow blocks.
[35:44.47]Alright, let's go.
[35:51.51]Doesn't matter how sloppy it is?
[35:57.25]Oh, dude, I got two.
[36:03.77]Ooh, the bonfire is dying.
[36:05.09]You have to throw more sticks into the fire or you will freeze.
[36:09.11]Wait, we can- I can die?
[36:10.27]I have a health meter?
[36:13.86]Wait, get more sticks in there!
[36:16.72]How much just should I use?
[36:20.36]Wait, am I using way too much?
[36:21.30]Oh, shit.
[36:21.96]I'm like- I'm the guy that you don't want to survive with.
[36:23.72]Is that better?
[36:26.42]Alright, more ice.
[36:33.48]Yo, man, if we burn a hundred sticks, we'll get a huge fire.
[36:39.87]It'll be really warm.
[36:43.09]Eat that guy first.
[36:46.53]Okay.
[36:47.25]Skill tree, yeah?
[36:52.25]To start building the igloo, you must first cut... I already did this.
[36:57.17]Okay, I'm just going to cut ice for a little while.
[37:00.51]Right?
[37:00.88]Why would I go back and forth?
[37:05.71]This one's empty?
[37:08.69]What?
[37:11.82]They're telling you because you're doing an awful job.
[37:13.38]What do you mean awful job?
[37:15.04]This one square meter that I can cut ice out.
[37:17.87]This game's fucking sick, by the way.
[37:27.46]I thought I was going to be building houses in like a neighborhood or something.
[37:32.00]This is actually cool.
[37:33.40]You have to like make your way, build your way up to that.
[37:40.09]How much can I carry?
[37:40.73]This is an IRL stream.
[37:46.71]I hope nobody ever does an IRL stream like this.
[37:48.66]I feel like I'd be terrified the whole time.
[37:57.18]Okay, so now... Where's my blocks?
[38:01.26]Ooh!
[38:03.77]I got a new skill!
[38:09.53]It's kind of a cereal box game, but I actually really like it.
[38:12.29]I'm gonna be honest.
[38:12.89]I got new skills.
[38:19.13]With this skill, you will cut six times more blocks.
[38:31.14]Yeah, this is definitely like a cereal box game.
[38:33.82]This is like the CD that comes in the cereal box.
[38:36.24]But you know what?
[38:37.72]Some of those games are actually really good.
[38:39.72]Whoa.
[38:42.96]I love it.
[38:49.74]Because it's so easy.
[38:51.06]It's so simple.
[38:55.16]By the way, please make sure you join me for my Elden Ring launch party.
[39:01.33]uh probably like four or five o'clock like maybe 16 hours into the launch be one of the last streamers you know playing it I would probably assure you of that alright what about this oh I can sprint 30 faster hey cool what's wrong what is the dog doing
[39:31.50]The dog's trying to add oxygen to the fire.
[39:34.48]Good boy!
[39:39.08]I have to hurry up.
[39:49.82]Go, go, go, go, go.
[39:53.96]I gotta get this done before nightfall.
[40:02.43]Shit.
[40:03.55]How is it at 0%?
[40:08.09]How is it at 0%?
[40:08.79]Wait, wait, wait.
[40:17.10]Okay, 15 times more blocks.
[40:19.46]Nice.
[40:22.88]How far can I go?
[40:23.52]Oh, we got some section.
[40:31.40]Oh, that was so satisfying.
[40:33.08]It's like little marshmallows.
[40:37.08]I just gotta collect blocks.
[40:48.14]30, 40, how many should I get?
[40:50.02]Fuck.
[40:56.35]Come on, stop.
[41:00.62]This game actually runs really well.
[41:03.94]Don't you think this is one of those games that should run at like eight frames a second?
[41:10.83]All these games run like shit, so it's actually kind of surprising.
[41:21.05]Almost done.
[41:23.51]Did I get the roof?
[41:25.23]This game's from two... This game's from 2011?
[41:28.17]No, it's not.
[41:28.67]It came out like last year or something.
[41:35.13]How do I build the roof?
[41:35.73]Start building the igloo.
[41:38.85]You must first cut ice blocks.
[41:39.99]I know.
[41:41.94]Should I jump up here?
[41:43.26]Can I go in?
[41:46.24]Let's crouch.
[41:48.24]Okay.
[41:51.28]This is a really, really funny igloo.
[41:53.06]I didn't know it had Twitch chat integration.
[41:58.16]That's funny.
[41:59.99]I'm killing it right now.
[42:03.57]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[42:08.06]Well, can't you go, like, get us a rabbit or something?
[42:11.83]Like, go, go get us, like, some food.
[42:16.35]What are you, come on.
[42:25.47]You're wasting wood.
[42:26.41]It's fine, we're gonna be surviving in there anyways.
[42:28.03]Go find a wascally rabbit.
[42:38.35]I don't even know if there's another one.
[42:46.33]Nice.
[42:48.15]I think the wood respawns.
[42:49.73]Oh, okay.
[42:50.25]That's good.
[42:52.31]Thanks for quelling my fears.
[42:53.39]I think that should be good.
[42:59.17]50?
[42:59.21]Yeah, that's good.
[43:08.91]I just said that without you paying me to say that.
[43:17.40]How dare you.
[43:19.18]Please reach out to my evolved representative, please.
[43:23.56]Or a retroactive payment...
[43:36.64]I gotta get inside.
[43:37.46]I thought it was 365 degrees in here.
[43:41.70]I was like, what?
[43:51.00]How many ice blocks does it take to do this?
[43:57.33]Oh my goodness, okay.
[43:58.61]I need more.
[44:04.54]Their character's arm is identical to a character in The Incredibles.
[44:10.44]I... I've never seen The Incredibles.
[44:18.16]No, I haven't.
[44:18.68]I know.
[44:18.90]I know that's like saying I've never seen Star Wars, right?
[44:24.82]The last... What was the... I think the last Disney Pixar movie that I saw was Meet the Robinsons.
[44:32.52]And the only reason why I watched that movie is because I thought the bowler hat guy was funny and cool.
[44:36.96]And, like, I wanted to see his scenes only.
[44:40.76]In fact, now that I'm remembering this, I think I just went to, like, YouTube and typed in all the bowler hat guy scenes.
[44:46.74]And didn't even watch the movie.
[44:49.66]Oh, no, I think I saw it.
[44:50.42]I think I watched it.
[45:00.79]I got it, don't worry.
[45:09.87]No, it was a nice movie.
[45:13.96]I especially like the trailer.
[45:16.18]When the dinosaur goes... He has big hands and little arms.
[45:26.20]I did it!
[45:31.31]We have the driveway.
[45:32.39]Press O to open the shop.
[45:35.55]Whoa.
[45:36.65]Wooden barricade.
[45:40.37]Where should I put this?
[45:44.69]What?
[45:45.50]Am I supposed to be doing this?
[45:58.41]Uh... You build an entrance to the igloo.
[46:01.05]You can build one in the same way you built the...
[46:08.58]I can move it, but where does it want me to put it?
[46:10.46]Nice.
[46:14.43]More?
[46:17.75]Where am I supposed to put this?
[46:18.67]I can't move it anywhere else.
[46:20.15]See what I mean?
[46:20.61]It's like I can't... Okay, it was stuck on there.
[46:25.39]That was weird.
[46:25.93]I can only build one?
[46:30.05]There we go.
[46:37.77]Alright, alright, look!
[46:40.39]Ark.
[46:43.67]You're playing Ark Survival Evolved.
[46:46.77]I like that name.
[46:47.37]I'm sorry.
[46:53.77]I'm sorry.
[46:54.81]It's so bad.
[46:59.53]It's so bad.
[47:00.55]There's a jump, too.
[47:07.80]How about Destiny 2?
[47:08.68]That was hard.
[47:09.40]That was a really hard game.
[47:23.39]This doesn't have really good feng shui.
[47:26.97]Sorry the igloo doesn't have... Like... What do you want?
[47:33.14]How do you want me to feng shui this?
[47:37.83]Looks like the igloo got punched in the face and lost a few teeth.
[47:46.74]That's it.
[47:48.84]Oh, cool.
[47:49.40]I did it.
[47:49.76]I got five stars.
[47:51.42]I did it in 13 minutes.
[47:52.28]I ran 986 miles.
[47:52.94]Ooh, wait.
[47:53.28]Stay here.
[47:53.76]Nice.
[48:09.42]This is a pizza oven.
[48:12.59]Okay, what's next?
[48:17.81]There are gunshots?
[48:18.89]Alright, so let's go.
[48:23.07]Report a bug.
[48:23.93]No, no, no, no.
[48:25.18]How do I leave here?
[48:30.16]Just exit?
[48:32.38]Save.
[48:37.88]Go to the main menu.
[48:38.59]Yeah.
[48:42.41]Okay, play.
[48:44.03]So I did this one.
[48:45.25]Nice.
[48:45.75]So what, any other things open up or do I have to go to the other one?
[48:52.27]This is a mud house and it's a level medium.
[48:55.27]Looks like we're going to start to include some wood.
[48:56.91]Okay.
[49:06.92]Here comes primitive technology germo.
[49:10.81]Fun fact, you don't give up easily, do you?
[49:13.44]Do you?
[49:13.98]I thought I said it twice.
[49:14.90]Like, do you?
[49:16.04]Good.
[49:16.38]As another challenge awaits you, I hope you brought an insect spray.
[49:19.38]You may need it.
[49:19.92]We heard some stories about a hungry lion around here.
[49:22.46]Let's get the job done quickly so we don't have to face him.
[49:26.55]What?
[49:26.79]Do I still have a dog?
[49:32.13]Okay.
[49:32.65]The first step is to lay stone foundations.
[49:35.19]Look around for stones in appropriate size, collect the required amount, and put them in the right places.
[49:39.10]Alright, so here's a stone.
[49:41.93]Okay, so I just get rocks?
[49:46.39]Using a player's sense.
[49:51.29]Wait, I... Oh, I have like... I have like hitman vision.
[49:59.85]The skill increases your strength by 50%.
[50:01.31]You can carry more materials with you in the tray without having to throw them away.
[50:06.21]Oh, that's a big deal.
[50:07.73]Let's go.
[50:09.55]Alright, so we just gotta find rocks.
[50:11.52]Let's go look around collecting rocks.
[50:13.88]My game revision.
[50:19.62]This game's awesome.
[50:23.84]Can I actually get attacked by a lion?
[50:25.16]Okay, this is just an MMO quest without the quest givers.
[50:36.37]I just have to go get like a hundred rocks and just go bring a hundred rocks here.
[50:39.53]I actually kind of like it.
[50:50.48]It's just Ark.
[50:54.08]I mean, it's not really Ark.
[50:58.11]This is probably more like lost Ark than it is Ark.
[51:08.73]This is a baby sensory game.
[51:10.67]It kind of feels like it.
[51:12.73]Good one.
[51:13.35]Thanks.
[51:14.35]I know that game is very relevant right now.
[51:17.75]I'm a relevant game.
[51:18.81]Relevant gamer Andy.
[51:26.18]I'm just going to do this for a little while.
[51:30.54]I kind of hope you can actually get attacked by a lion.
[51:33.18]That would make the game a full letter grade higher for me.
[51:40.16]I have 14.
[51:42.33]What if I can't do it?
[51:43.09]What if I don't have enough?
[51:44.19]This game is really relaxing.
[51:47.37]Yeah, this game's good.
[51:48.67]This is actually... Let's hold our judgments.
[51:53.67]But... I mean, this is... I like this.
[51:57.50]Let's just collect thing and bring thing here.
[52:03.76]It's so easy for me to understand.
[52:08.74]One more.
[52:13.67]Alright, level up.
[52:16.43]Pick up the axe.
[52:20.87]What?
[52:22.21]Get closer to a palm tree with the axe equipped.
[52:24.90]There's melee attacks in this game.
[52:28.78]Cut the palm tree down.
[52:35.44]Wow.
[52:36.63]Oh, it falls into pieces.
[52:44.52]Okay, cool.
[52:44.96]Pick up a log.
[52:48.20]Wait, did I not?
[52:49.28]Does it want me to go?
[52:52.64]Does it want me to do?
[53:02.53]Oh, I need to use my gamer sense.
[53:03.73]Thank you.
[53:17.90]What?
[53:18.10]Oh, I gotta cut it?
[53:18.86]Are you serious?
[53:24.14]Whoa.
[53:27.64]Why am I talking like this is some huge innovation?
[53:30.42]Okay, now... Get some of these sticks up.
[53:36.50]I need more trees.
[53:47.97]You sound like you're experiencing life for the first time.
[53:53.88]It's kind of interesting.
[53:54.66]Guys, go look at the Steam store page for this.
[54:02.51]There's like cement trucks and shit.
[54:05.67]We're just scratching the surface.
[54:17.82]Ooh, skill up.
[54:18.46]Faster tree cutting, I'm gonna say.
[54:26.40]Oh, 60% faster run speed.
[54:29.88]Fog, we're in a 30 second loop.
[54:35.85]Yeah, but it's a fun 30 second loop.
[54:37.93]Gameplay loops are okay if they're fun.
[54:50.35]Cut the music?
[54:50.81]No, it didn't.
[54:51.15]It's still here.
[54:51.55]Alright, here we go.
[54:54.61]One, two.
[54:56.49]There it is.
[54:58.40]New skill.
[54:58.94]Now what do I do?
[54:59.62]Wait, there's more?
[55:02.26]This skill will allow you to chop palms faster.
[55:03.96]Yep.
[55:07.68]Where you do the same thing over and over again.
[55:08.92]Yeah, it's relaxing.
[55:10.50]I like it.
[55:17.13]There are more trees?
[55:21.43]BMCA, what?
[55:23.33]Turn on the furnace?
[55:26.71]What?
[55:31.51]Is there a free demo version of this game?
[55:33.23]I don't know.
[55:35.97]What is this?
[55:36.35]I have like logs already here.
[55:46.82]Living in the 21st century, doing something mean to it.
[55:49.80]What are you saying?
[55:54.13]Living in the 21st century, doing something mean to it better than anybody you've ever seen.
[55:57.17]Screams from the haters.
[56:00.95]Those are the lyrics.
[56:06.21]I don't listen to any music.
[56:11.80]Because I think the last piece of music I listened to was like one of the Attack on Titan intro songs.
[56:17.50]That's it.
[56:18.38]That's it.
[56:19.12]And then before that, I think it was on the radio.
[56:36.33]I have a lot of these twines.
[56:37.79]This actually is pretty helpful because this is kind of how it works, right?
[56:48.78]This is how you build a house.
[56:58.59]There ain't no more trees.
[57:00.89]I've cut them all down.
[57:01.67]Ahhhh.
[57:09.02]This music is annoying me.
[57:11.66]Just relax.
[57:13.62]You don't have to listen to it for another 10 minutes.
[57:16.88]I like it.
[57:17.75]I think it sounds good.
[57:18.51]Alright, here we go.
[57:34.70]I think that should be in a good spot.
[57:36.28]Now we have to get those... To keep the construction from falling apart, you need to tie logs together using rope made of tropical tree bark.
[57:45.93]As you cut down trees, you may have also found some tropical rope.
[57:48.49]You have to collect the required amount and put it in the correct place.
[57:52.38]Alright.
[57:56.04]Let's go.
[57:58.00]Build.
[58:01.59]Oh, there it is.
[58:07.98]Okay, that tied it together.
[58:11.98]I did it?
[58:12.34]Alright.
[58:13.70]Support for roof tiles.
[58:15.28]In this stage, you also need palm logs.
[58:17.31]Collect them by cutting down trees as before.
[58:19.25]Do I have any?
[58:23.75]Still have a few.
[58:25.95]Shit, I need more trees.
[58:32.57]That voice sounds like Joel.
[58:36.81]It does?
[58:37.47]Hold on.
[58:40.37]It sounds like Joel.
[58:42.66]I need to hear it.
[58:47.04]Let me just cut down a shitload of trees.
[58:48.44]Somebody just said, fuck SNL and the whole cast.
[58:59.90]What?
[59:00.30]What are you talking about?
[59:01.78]Why are you saying that?
[59:03.71]This is Jerma985.
[59:06.27]This is Jerma's stream.
[59:07.58]Why are you saying that?
[59:09.08]What happened?
[59:09.50]What are you doing?
[59:10.70]What happened?
[59:17.88]Why are you saying that?
[59:18.98]What does that have to do with me?
[59:28.27]I keep thinking you guys are talking, alright.
[59:30.20]I'm so out of the loop with everything.
[59:32.02]I'm completely out of the loop.
[59:36.32]100%.
[59:38.38]I thought just some guys coming in here going like, hey, by the way, dude, like, fuck SNL.
[59:41.72]And like, fuck the whole, the whole cast.
[59:43.76]I was like, alright, man, like, what?
[59:46.48]What do you want me to do about it?
[59:47.44]Why are you saying that to me?
[60:02.53]I think there's enough trees.
[60:05.06]Rip the SNL sponsorship.
[60:07.30]I got it.
[60:07.56]You know what?
[60:09.00]What are some sponsorships that I really would actually want?
[60:13.64]What should I get?
[60:14.62]What should I try to get?
[60:15.42]What do you guys think?
[60:19.03]Something that makes sense to me.
[60:20.87]Something that makes sense to me.
[60:21.87]McDonald's.
[60:32.60]I would do that.
[60:33.20]Yeah, I would.
[60:35.36]I literally did that last stream.
[60:37.54]And this is before doing anything with like a sponsorship or anything.
[60:41.61]I literally did a full like 10 minute McDonald's ad.
[60:45.99]I would do it.
[60:46.35]Yeah, that's a good one.
[60:49.12]Smarties.
[60:51.90]Guys, if you think that Smarties is going to pay some random dickhead streamer like me to do anything, like you're out of your mind.
[61:01.00]Skill increases your strength by 100%.
[61:02.32]Cool.
[61:02.54]I got a shop now.
[61:12.26]Fence of logs?
[61:14.14]Oh, decoration.
[61:14.70]How about fence of logs?
[61:15.84]Where should I put this?
[61:26.66]Oops.
[61:32.37]Okay, I got that twine.
[61:33.25]I can do this.
[61:34.78]I got a lot of it.
[61:45.32]I like the sounds.
[61:46.08]Some of the sounds kind of make you- remind you like you're collecting gems or something.
[61:53.82]I've got to do it like a bunch in a row.
[61:56.20]So it's like I walk in and I open up the crate and a bunch of gems fall out and I touch them all in like one second, right?
[62:03.36]Ugh, that's good.
[62:04.70]That was good.
[62:09.72]That's good.
[62:10.70]Alright, time for some walls.
[62:14.69]Making mud.
[62:17.83]What do I have to do?
[62:19.05]Put mud in here and then fill it with water?
[62:26.21]Pick up a shovel.
[62:29.39]Get some clay.
[62:30.42]Okay.
[62:32.20]Put the clay into the basket.
[62:39.51]Pick up the wooden bowl.
[62:43.58]Scoop some water into bowl from stream.
[62:50.44]Pour water into basket.
[62:56.10]Whoa.
[62:58.90]I thought that said stuttering help.
[63:00.78]Like if the game is having a problem.
[63:02.32]Whoa, what is that?
[63:03.04]Fake reactions.
[63:06.02]Okay, so I can make clay?
[63:09.49]Mud Shaper, you have a basket full of clay and there's a block from near the stove.
[63:13.77]Take the clay out of the basket and put it into the form.
[63:25.71]What?
[63:25.95]Okay, cool.
[63:27.21]Now what?
[63:28.97]That's it?
[63:30.07]How much do I have to do?
[63:31.03]Oh my god, this just like tasks the game.
[63:33.12]Alright.
[63:44.67]There's got to be a skill point I can do for this.
[63:48.33]Yeah, more mud blocks, please.
[63:52.11]That was really sus, what you just said.
[63:53.59]This way.
[64:03.44]Got it.
[64:07.10]I went to school for bricking.
[64:13.12]You did?
[64:16.28]Did I just read another other like like song lyric or something?
[64:19.26]What are you talking about?
[64:22.56]Feel like I'm reading stuff that I don't I have no context of what's going on.
[64:32.18]Oh Hell yeah, yeah This is gonna take forever, but I'm obsessed
[64:47.88]I'm studying right now.
[64:48.62]Can you please shut up for once?
[64:49.98]Yeah.
[64:51.06]I'll be quiet.
[64:53.44]Here's the thing, though.
[64:54.54]If you're going to tell me to be quiet on my stream, you better get at least a C on that.
[65:00.82]Whatever it is.
[65:04.82]Oh, I need mud.
[65:06.17]Okay, now I need water.
[65:19.42]At least, I didn't say be quiet.
[65:21.03]I said to get a C. Nice.
[65:30.58]That's so much better.
[65:47.14]HDTV presents the Saw stream?
[66:01.74]You know what's funny though?
[66:04.70]I mean, don't be surprised.
[66:08.53]Not necessarily that exact company, but that's kind of funny to me in its own way.
[66:20.60]How Franksburgers presents the diaper stream.
[66:25.00]Like, um, you know, do you know what you're signing up for here?
[66:37.30]That was always the plan.
[66:48.63]Cool.
[66:49.55]That's one wall done.
[66:54.56]I still have a lot.
[66:55.78]I gotta do that on all sides, okay.
[66:58.80]Can I hold the button?
[66:59.54]No.
[66:59.68]I mean, for a cereal box game, this has great sound effects, which makes me want to continue to place the bricks.
[67:16.15]By any means necessary, right?
[67:29.97]You will form unimaginable more mud blocks at the same time.
[67:32.97]It allows you to build brick after brick all the time.
[67:35.47]There it is.
[67:36.95]Are you going to play the new goblin game?
[67:47.03]I don't know what that is.
[67:56.05]Probably shouldn't be doing it like that, but that's what the tutorial did.
[67:58.73]Let's see what ungodly amounts look like.
[68:00.79]Eh, it's not that much.
[68:05.54]It ain't that much.
[68:06.06]He doesn't know.
[68:18.08]You've not played the new goblin game.
[68:22.23]I can easily imagine that many bricks.
[68:25.79]I know.
[68:26.05]Like, what the fuck?
[68:29.26]False advertising and shit.
[68:42.16]Are you gonna have... Nevermind.
[68:49.02]What the fuck is going on?
[68:52.58]It's a game where you build houses.
[68:56.24]What do you want me to tell you?
[69:05.09]All games and all movies and all TV shows, you could just say, like, what the fuck is going on?
[69:13.80]Something otherworldly or something that, like, well, this is not otherworldly, but look, you could say that about the Muppets.
[69:21.34]Like, okay, do you go, do you turn the channel and you get on like Muppets Take Manhattan and go, what the fuck is going on?
[69:28.61]Who are these like little weirdos?
[69:29.99]Who's that little green guy?
[69:32.23]No, it's like a piece of media.
[69:33.97]You just, you're gonna, you'll figure it out.
[69:36.41]Somebody will help you.
[69:37.19]You can enjoy it.
[69:40.85]Wait, wait, what the fuck's going on here?
[69:42.38]That bear, that bear can talk?
[69:48.52]Why does he sound like Yoda?
[69:51.22]Ah, ah, ah, ah, two-voiced Andy.
[70:01.43]I have 174 of these.
[70:24.42]Did not think I was going to like that as much as I do.
[70:30.24]Holy shit, that was cool.
[70:31.45]Alright, I got a new... What is this?
[70:34.83]You can form more mud blocks than you really need.
[70:36.85]That's fine, just get it.
[70:46.78]What is your IRL house made out of?
[70:48.54]I think it's pretty much the same thing that everybody's IRL house is made out of.
[70:53.77]Kitty litter and, uh... I think that's it.
[70:58.37]Kitty litter and water.
[70:59.16]That's cement, right?
[71:08.58]That's what it is?
[71:09.46]Something like that.
[71:20.23]Wow, okay, now that is actually a lot.
[71:25.58]That's a pretty decent amount.
[71:34.14]Zero.
[71:34.60]Can I make a ladder?
[71:35.32]How many clay balls do you think you could fit in a Subway sandwich?
[71:45.49]One?
[71:45.65]I would assume maybe one.
[71:49.83]Well, that would just be the sandwich.
[72:00.27]It would just be two pieces of bread and a thing of clay.
[72:05.97]But you don't eat clay.
[72:08.85]I remember during the Halloween stream when Bugleberry was eating spiders off of the table, which I'm not sure you could even see on the stream.
[72:19.30]But there was little spiders that were being pulled with string across the table, and I was eating them with my hands.
[72:27.56]I mean, I was backstage mimicking Bugleberry, like, oh, that's what I want you to do.
[72:31.78]Like, directing.
[72:34.14]But that's what that was supposed to be.
[72:36.68]And I got a lot of comments saying, Bugleberry, Bugleberry, don't put clay like that in your mouth.
[72:45.71]I remember, I remember like, you know, if that were to be a mask, right?
[72:50.65]Which it's not, that's somebody's skin.
[72:52.76]But if that was a mask that somebody was wearing, which absolutely not the case.
[72:59.34]But if there was a mask, the clay that caked around their mouth like a little kid eating a chocolate bar, that stayed there for the whole BRB.
[73:17.61]I had to desperately wipe off.
[73:22.63]You know.
[73:25.63]That'd be kind of interesting.
[73:33.15]Don't eat clay, by the way.
[73:35.03]Like, honestly.
[73:35.61]I think it actually... People were saying it's like, don't put it in your... It's like actually fucking horrible.
[73:40.71]I don't remember why, but I know it's just like, don't fucking do that.
[73:43.11]Don't put it in your mouth.
[73:49.38]What's the actual reason why?
[73:51.18]It's something like that.
[73:55.04]Play is just dust.
[73:59.87]There's a certain disease.
[74:01.15]Really?
[74:01.55]Yeah.
[74:02.53]Yeah, don't fuck around with that shit.
[74:03.69]Seriously, don't.
[74:10.66]Really?
[74:10.92]I need one more.
[74:20.40]Is there a way I can pull that back?
[74:21.46]It has minerals.
[74:28.05]Clay from Minecraft.
[74:31.71]Yeah, that's where clay is from.
[74:38.24]Do we have a whole generation of kids that think that clay is from Minecraft?
[74:43.52]We don't, right?
[74:47.26]What do I need?
[74:48.63]Shape the tiles in the same way the blocks.
[74:57.89]What?
[74:59.71]Using the mold on the other side of the basket.
[75:06.16]Where?
[75:09.00]Oh, here.
[75:09.36]Okay.
[75:12.44]That's it?
[75:15.72]Wait.
[75:17.19]Shape the tiles in the same way to the blocks, but using the mold on the other side of the basket.
[75:22.01]Light up the furnace by putting some wood into the hole at its base.
[75:25.27]Finally, put raw tiles through the chimney.
[75:28.66]Oh, that's what this is for.
[75:36.86]What would even be funnier if... What would even be funnier is if kids... Hold on.
[75:42.68]That went too fast.
[75:46.30]The kids thought redstone was from Minecraft.
[75:49.68]You know what's funny?
[75:50.56]I'm one of those kids.
[75:53.90]I thought that that redstone was just like a jokey thing that was made.
[75:57.70]Just made up for the game.
[76:04.76]It's not.
[76:05.76]It is.
[76:06.22]Wait, it is.
[76:08.78]What are you doing to me?
[76:09.56]Why are you making me look like an idiot?
[76:10.53]How do I put this in?
[76:16.92]Put wood, right?
[76:17.56]How do I do this?
[76:27.38]It requires wood to light a fire.
[76:29.39]So where is it?
[76:29.95]I just hit right click.
[76:32.17]What is happening?
[76:33.25]Is it working?
[76:35.21]Oh!
[76:39.37]Where do they come out?
[76:52.82]Turn off the furnace.
[76:54.23]Where are they?
[77:01.13]Where are they?
[77:06.50]Skill points.
[77:06.96]I don't have any skills.
[77:07.62]You have to fill the whole thing up?
[77:12.55]Oh, shit.
[77:12.95]Okay, I see.
[77:23.24]Okay.
[77:24.80]Building.
[77:26.44]Unit lost.
[77:27.78]Unit lost.
[77:30.28]Unit lost.
[77:32.41]Construction complete.
[77:37.65]Ooh.
[77:45.27]Can I reach all the way up there?
[77:46.31]Mr. McGraw mustache.
[77:50.69]I did.
[77:50.93]I looked disgusting.
[77:51.81]And I shaved it.
[77:52.30]And I said never again.
[78:00.07]I'm just going to do this for a little while because... Let's just kind of get that started.
[78:05.54]Grow a better mustache.
[78:14.87]I can't really grow facial hair.
[78:17.49]I know that everybody says, everybody I know, yeah, yeah, yeah, dude, you're not doing it for long enough.
[78:22.97]You keep getting to like the, you just went through puberty and decided not to shave your face because maybe A, you don't know how, or B, you think it looks good.
[78:35.66]I know I'm at that, I hit that stage, right?
[78:37.96]And that's all it looks like.
[78:38.96]That's all it looks like for me.
[78:44.20]It never goes over that stage.
[78:47.80]I will go a month without shaving and it still looks like that.
[78:50.82]I need more of this stuff.
[78:55.45]More.
[79:23.81]Ah, anybody else relaxed right now?
[79:26.07]Like, wicked bad.
[79:26.93]I want some more coffee.
[79:38.40]Oh, wood.
[79:46.14]How much did you take?
[79:47.12]Um.
[79:48.40]What do you mean?
[80:00.05]much of what did I take coffee I had one cup of coffee one that's it I saw alright I want do we get to like the actual homes like houses like with concrete and floorboards and I feel like that's gonna happen soon
[80:33.68]Alright, I can do this.
[80:34.36]I got 72.
[80:34.58]That should be enough.
[80:36.75]Ooh, look at this!
[80:41.79]Why are you changing the subject?
[80:43.45]What subject were we on?
[80:44.35]Were we on a subject?
[80:47.51]I don't remember the subject.
[81:01.02]Read a clock.
[81:05.74]Guys, there are no clocks where I am.
[81:10.52]There's no electricity.
[81:11.46]How do I get up there?
[81:15.06]Can I stand on something?
[81:21.54]I can't stand on this.
[81:40.27]I need to look up.
[81:41.11]Oh, I can go inside.
[81:42.05]Right, right, right.
[81:50.00]Clock debacle?
[81:52.38]Yeah, I have not really taken any THC since that.
[82:00.24]I remember.
[82:00.86]Okay, I remember very specifically.
[82:04.60]So, when I... It's true!
[82:07.03]Well, actually, New Year's Eve last year, right?
[82:14.47]So when I did that and I looked back and I watched the clip and I knew how desperate I was to try to just like get the right time.
[82:22.09]So this is what I did.
[82:24.63]I watched that footage back and I did the thing that you go like this but you just can't believe it and you're so pissed because you look so stupid.
[82:33.20]I did one of these.
[82:35.70]I went like this watching it.
[82:44.69]You know when you wipe your fucking face because you just can't believe it?
[82:48.30]You're just sitting there going... That's what I was doing, and I didn't want to have that reaction again.
[83:00.77]I was just rubbing my mouth going like, God...
[83:16.07]And because I was looking at the chat, and here's the thing.
[83:18.97]Everybody in the chat saying, this has to be bullshit.
[83:23.51]This has to be made up.
[83:25.60]Right?
[83:26.24]Like, there's no way you are doing this not on purpose, right?
[83:31.44]It's like, fuck, I just look so stupid.
[83:38.56]But then I also had this same kind of epiphany a little bit here.
[83:43.19]I thought about this the other day, and this is a really interesting topic.
[83:47.07]I haven't been... Now this, again, you're going to say, what does this have to do with reading a clock?
[83:51.91]That's like basic human knowledge.
[83:54.73]I haven't been in a classroom in almost 20 years.
[84:01.52]And I think about that a lot.
[84:02.48]I remember being in class and like the memory is so fleeting to me.
[84:08.58]It's such a distant memory of doing essays and problems and tests and... It's a fleeting memory, and that's weird to think about.
[84:23.36]Because I remember being up all night like, fuck, I gotta cram for this test.
[84:28.16]That's so long ago.
[84:32.81]What am I doing?
[84:41.47]It's kind of a foreign concept, right?
[84:44.33]What the fuck just happened?
[84:46.45]What?
[84:47.25]Are these done?
[84:47.83]Are these actually finished?
[84:51.70]Um, I don't... I don't think these are done.
[84:59.54]They are done.
[85:00.38]What have I been doing?
[85:07.03]Muscle man.
[85:13.89]and jump.
[85:20.05]But memory is a weird thing because those memories from like 15, 20 plus years ago, they're like, they're like stopping existing.
[85:31.44]They're being, like my hard drive is writing over that information in a way, which is really bizarre to think about.
[85:41.56]Trust me when I tell you, as somebody that's turning 37 this year.
[85:45.69]Once your hard drive starts to write over information from 20 years ago is when you're going to start to look around and be like, what?
[85:51.19]Wow.
[85:51.51]Well done.
[85:56.53]Can I do this?
[86:06.84]What's this?
[86:10.98]right?
[86:12.12]Yeah, no, it's a weird feeling because I didn't have this feeling back in my, let's say, mid-20s, right?
[86:21.11]In my mid to late 20s, it was kind of, that was still not necessarily fresh in my mind, but it was still close.
[86:28.57]I'm approaching that period where being in school is a distant memory.
[86:40.90]Almost done.
[86:41.32]There it is.
[86:44.88]How many childhood memories do you think your brain deleted to replace with shitty internet memes?
[86:50.78]You know, that's like kind of unfortunate if you really think about it.
[86:55.79]That's really kind of unfortunate.
[87:03.77]Got it.
[87:07.77]Oh, in the middle.
[87:16.96]Ooh, construction complete.
[87:20.12]Somebody is shooting.
[87:21.54]Okay, now I get it.
[87:22.76]Now I understand what you're talking about.
[87:23.94]Somebody is firing a gun at me.
[87:27.71]I want to get a look at it.
[87:31.41]Oh.
[87:33.01]A trapper house.
[87:36.73]Any more?
[87:40.11]Ooh.
[87:43.45]A half-timbered house.
[87:45.28]Ooh.
[87:45.50]Ooh.
[87:48.54]Any others?
[87:49.04]That's the Trapper House.
[87:56.43]I'm gonna do the Half Timber House.
[88:03.17]Watch movie?
[88:04.97]What?
[88:07.76]Wait, what do you mean watch movie?
[88:11.76]What?
[88:15.92]Buy now.
[88:23.82]Watch the movie.
[88:26.72]Okay, let's watch the movie.
[88:30.84]What is this a movie of?
[88:33.44]Wait, I don't want to watch somebody else's stream.
[88:52.61]Hey, by the way, you gotta up your bitrate, man.
[88:55.25]You're screaming at, like, fucking 500k.
[88:56.83]This is better than Jerma Street.
[89:07.60]Is this a lawnmower?
[89:10.77]I'm gonna do this.
[89:12.29]I can't do this?
[89:24.68]Now this is a trailer, it's not out yet.
[89:26.80]I think this is early access or something.
[89:34.36]But you're spoiling the whole thing.
[89:35.60]I don't want to see the whole thing.
[89:39.34]You're showing me the whole house.
[89:47.10]I don't want to see the whole house.
[90:04.57]Volume down.
[90:05.61]I kind of can't.
[90:14.75]Alright.
[90:25.21]I need to know.
[90:26.05]We just saw the whole thing get built.
[90:36.90]Okay.
[90:38.34]Well, that's not available.
[90:40.44]The other one is.
[90:40.88]Alright, let's go to that one.
[90:48.71]This one's available.
[90:49.97]Sell.
[90:52.15]Wait, I bought it, now I sell it.
[90:55.16]Oh, I was going to say, what?
[90:56.10]Sludge hammer.
[90:57.30]Sludge hammer.
[91:02.98]Okay, that's like if Dark Souls would be like,
[91:32.99]Here we are.
[91:33.97]Firelink Shrine.
[91:35.27]You're on your own, motherfucker.
[91:36.65]Good luck.
[91:37.65]It's Dark Souls.
[91:38.21]It's hard as shit and we don't help you.
[91:40.51]And then I walk up to the first enemy.
[91:42.70]And I take a swing.
[91:44.16]And the game pauses.
[91:46.54]And there's three.
[91:48.26]One, two, three.
[91:50.16]On the screen images.
[91:51.90]With different paragraphs under each image.
[91:56.18]Explaining how to swing the weapon.
[91:59.58]That's what they're doing here.
[92:00.84]Leave me alone.
[92:04.87]Which, look, I gotta be honest.
[92:06.09]I said this the other day.
[92:07.13]I said this when I was playing the VR stuff, too.
[92:10.85]Like, the video game tutorial... Just tell me how to... Do I really need to be told how to swing the weapon?
[92:21.18]It's left-click in every single video game.
[92:26.84]like can you just give me like a cheat sheet with all the buttons on it I don't know why we still have to go and remember right click is aim you don't have to tell me that like just show it to me what is your first game ever it's not it's this should be we need to have like a I don't know why would that be your first game ever it's not
[92:58.18]left click is a do thing every game alright let me see what this says there should be a tutorial game yeah there should be like steam should come up with an app that you can download that's just like getting started with gaming and you put just have every game follow the same basic rules and you can open up this like steam how-to
[93:29.74]Remember, most games have left click as their means of attacking or shooting.
[93:36.36]And then the game can come up, it could be like, here we go, here's the tutorial, here we go.
[93:40.74]Instead of spending like six plus hours tutorialing me, just please refer to the Steam Workshop app tutorial if you don't know how to use a computer.
[93:51.58]And then we can shave the first six fucking hours of just stretching to add cutscenes to tutorials to make it worth showing so the developers don't feel like, uh, we're gonna have to spend two hours telling people how to play the game.
[94:05.37]We have to make up like a fucking story that they can play through in the tutorial.
[94:08.47]They don't have to do that anymore.
[94:10.63]Just get to the good stuff!
[94:11.83]Get to the meat!
[94:18.27]Can we watch the new Five Nights at Freddy's video?
[94:21.33]No!
[94:22.17]We're not watching Five Nights at Freddy's.
[94:23.69]You're watching Jerma.
[94:26.59]This place sucks.
[94:28.06]So you picked a good one.
[94:29.26]Alright, we'll start building a trapper's house from the foundations.
[94:33.72]These are logs that are well embedded in the soil, right?
[94:37.74]You can get the logs by cutting these trees.
[94:42.18]It's a deer!
[94:49.59]You move fast.
[94:54.77]There's pigs!
[94:55.69]Wait, why did you develop pigs?
[94:57.99]Why have pigs and like animals?
[95:10.10]Okay.
[95:10.90]Let's go back to what I was saying.
[95:13.99]Oh shit, it's just like Minecraft.
[95:15.01]I don't know where my house is.
[95:15.93]There it is.
[95:16.23]Can I get in the car?
[95:18.29]Please tell me I can drive the truck.
[95:21.37]Can I?
[95:21.83]Please?
[95:24.17]It's okay.
[95:27.85]Alright, what the fuck am I doing?
[95:29.57]I need to read this.
[95:32.52]Please refer to the Steam tutorial app.
[95:35.80]Gaming for beginners.
[95:37.58]I would probably flip out right now.
[95:40.54]Yeah.
[95:41.25]Imagine if that's what it told me.
[95:45.25]This sucks so much.
[95:48.43]Okay, you can get the logs by cutting trees nearby.
[95:50.83]Remember that you have to cut logs by chainsaw to blueprint size.
[95:57.01]And of course, debark each log with draw shave.
[96:02.70]Okay, let's go ahead.
[96:10.44]I'm gonna cut down logs.
[96:13.02]Cut these down.
[96:24.23]Scree?
[96:25.91]Scree?
[96:26.47]What is that?
[96:26.85]To change distance?
[96:27.95]Oh, scroll.
[96:32.25]I thought it was space bar.
[96:34.06]No, I thought it was scrape bar.
[96:36.86]Am I doing this wrong?
[96:42.46]Uh-oh.
[96:46.34]What do I do?
[96:50.29]These are 1.15 in length.
[96:54.89]What?
[97:01.46]That's way bigger than that.
[97:02.80]Isn't that huge?
[97:17.92]What is going on?
[97:22.30]Thank you.
[97:23.32]Thank you so much.
[97:24.76]Here it is.
[97:27.12]This is it right here.
[97:27.98]I need a chainsaw.
[97:34.15]Here it is.
[97:34.43]Alright, here's my best chainsaw impression.
[97:53.15]I just picked up the whole tree.
[97:59.73]Oh fuck, now what do I do?
[98:11.47]I'm a forester and I'm impressed.
[98:13.87]Hey, thanks.
[98:21.52]Oh, shit.
[98:22.08]Okay, this may... No, no, no.
[98:31.53]That's too big.
[98:32.09]It looks like dog sausages.
[98:34.59]No, have you guys ever had combos?
[98:36.17]Okay.
[98:38.35]It needs to be that tall.
[98:40.13]How tall is this?
[98:47.48]1.5.
[98:47.52]That's not even right.
[98:49.02]Why is it doing this?
[98:59.61]It's like 0.65.
[99:00.47]Okay.
[99:08.62]Right there.
[99:08.96]Alright.
[99:10.64]Got it.
[99:11.80]Is that right?
[99:20.84]What am I supposed to do with this shit?
[99:36.20]Oh, I have to de-bark it.
[99:37.47]How do I do that?
[99:37.99]How do I de-bark it?
[100:00.22]Like that?
[100:09.04]Oh, I actually have to move my hand.
[100:10.94]I was going to say, what's going on?
[100:18.11]Alright.
[100:18.75]I get it.
[100:19.15]I get it.
[100:19.49]I get it.
[100:20.15]I get it.
[100:20.83]I get it.
[100:34.12]He's learning.
[100:37.08]He said everything is left click.
[100:38.93]Now, okay, there's a difference between adding a game mechanic later, right?
[100:45.95]But even adding the game mechanics... We spend so much time telling you how to play rather than letting you play.
[100:52.99]Dark Souls, greatest game franchise of all time.
[101:05.47]These are already done.
[101:06.09]They're too big.
[101:10.25]No, these are perfect.
[101:12.84]No tutorial Andy.
[101:14.52]That one was not even the right size.
[101:15.66]Size actually doesn't even matter.
[101:32.15]No, it doesn't.
[101:40.30]A couple more of these logs.
[101:44.66]The guy that's five says whatever.
[101:46.52]The guy that's not that tall says size doesn't matter.
[101:54.72]You're wicked funny.
[101:55.58]You're wicked funny.
[101:57.28]Are you gonna ever do the wink redemption thing again?
[102:01.22]Let me ask you a question.
[102:04.26]So back when I had the wink redemption channel points...
[102:08.13]There were probably 3,000 concurrent- 4,000 concurrent people here, like a year or two ago.
[102:11.93]There were almost 19,000 people watching this stream.
[102:18.35]Turning Winx back on would- that would- the broadcast would be over.
[102:23.97]It would be only Winx redemptions, the entire stream.
[102:26.49]It would never be anything else.
[102:29.21]Ever.
[102:29.37]Because it already was all I was doing back when I had a third of the audience.
[102:37.50]That would be unbearable.
[102:40.54]That was a flex.
[102:43.04]It's not a flex.
[102:43.80]I'm just... Whatever.
[102:50.72]Just make them really expensive.
[102:57.00]Do one, please.
[102:58.43]Fine.
[103:00.47]Okay, I will do one wink.
[103:02.35]I will wink into the camera.
[103:05.14]If you guys, without any like mod help, right?
[103:09.79]Not like, oh, we can clear the chat.
[103:11.95]I don't want to see a chat message of 10 whole seconds.
[103:17.97]I want the chat to stop and I don't want it to move.
[103:21.92]I want no one to write anything for a full 10 seconds and I'll do it.
[103:34.46]Dot dot dot dots.
[103:36.06]Just nothing in the chat.
[103:38.44]It's just frozen and that's not moving.
[103:48.24]This game has animals that are more detailed than Red Dead Redemption 2.
[103:53.33]That's actually a really well made elk.
[104:02.39]There's a fox too.
[104:08.91]Shut up.
[104:09.65]Yeah, see how easy it is to get you to keep talking?
[104:18.85]Wait, it's doing it for me.
[104:23.13]I fucked that up so bad, the game was like, you know what, don't worry about it, I'm gonna do it for you.
[104:31.16]Impressive!
[104:32.12]This scared me.
[104:34.10]Alright.
[104:34.96]Use a chainsaw, uh-huh.
[104:39.83]Alright, we're not playing that game anymore.
[104:42.90]You also prepare the next logs in the same way.
[104:44.66]You're cutting another tree, debark them from the bark with a special tool, and then you cover the chainsaw.
[104:50.02]Okay.
[104:51.80]This is cool.
[104:57.40]Do I need this?
[104:58.04]We have to debark this.
[105:04.13]Debark it.
[105:07.43]Well, that's way better than what I was doing.
[105:12.89]I did that in the probably dumbest possible way.
[105:15.07]But guys, size doesn't even matter.
[105:16.23]Watch.
[105:24.33]Watch.
[105:29.73]Alright, now I'm making it bread.
[105:42.84]I can make wood salami.
[105:58.40]Make it thinner.
[105:59.77]Can you make it thinner, please?
[106:04.25]I love thin slices of deli meat.
[106:08.67]Let's be honest.
[106:11.02]When the person behind the counter holds it up and goes, is this alright?
[106:15.84]You just say yes.
[106:17.24]You know what I mean?
[106:17.90]Like, does it really matter that much?
[106:27.48]like honestly if you for a lot of the people that go to the deli and they go um can you make it super super thin for me and they do it and they show it up and they go a little bit thinner than that please and they go okay they could probably just put the same piece of salami up and they would think it was fine like oh yeah yeah I'll do it how's this oh that's much better
[107:00.05]Alright, what am I?
[107:00.67]Stop doing this.
[107:01.41]I need to, like, actually cut this correctly.
[107:02.79]How far is this?
[107:08.91]Two point... 2.9 meters.
[107:11.56]Alright, I gotta get... This is all trash now.
[107:13.20]I gotta get rid of this.
[107:16.34]Like, when the person at the deli counter just kind of goes, hey, is that alright?
[107:20.68]I mean, if it's way too thick, you just be like, oh, can you do, like, a little bit thinner?
[107:25.00]Or before they even start cutting it, you go, can you make it thin?
[107:28.18]That's it.
[107:40.93]Put facecam on, we've been good.
[107:42.75]Mm-hmm.
[107:42.89]Where's my house?
[107:54.36]Oh, there it is.
[107:54.80]Okay.
[107:58.34]Aw, cute fox.
[108:05.67]Is it getting nighttime?
[108:08.39]Alright, stop.
[108:09.01]I need to cut trees down.
[108:17.65]Now I need 2.8 meters.
[108:19.21]Starting here.
[108:24.94]How many can I get out of this?
[108:26.16]It's this 2.9 right there.
[108:28.40]I can get probably three.
[108:29.22]Alright, 2.9.
[108:30.80]Got it.
[108:31.06]It's going to take forever.
[108:33.75]I'm not giving up.
[108:45.54]Is that close enough for this?
[108:47.08]2.9.
[108:47.14]I can do it twice.
[108:47.80]2.9.
[108:51.80]There it is.
[108:52.92]Okay.
[109:00.12]So it's three equal pieces.
[109:02.74]I don't need to measure anymore.
[109:10.70]Just do three equal pieces.
[109:11.60]Okay, pick it up.
[109:18.19]What?
[109:22.89]Oh, God.
[109:23.69]Damn it.
[109:24.11]It's that.
[109:24.95]Okay.
[109:26.63]That's the outer edge.
[109:30.83]Oh, that's a whole tree.
[109:36.68]That's the whole thing.
[109:37.20]Alright, cut another one down.
[109:40.24]I got it now.
[109:40.70]I just didn't.
[109:47.55]Three equal parts.
[109:49.90]Wait.
[109:50.92]Just skin this thing.
[109:53.16]That's way better.
[109:53.86]Okay.
[109:54.30]So much faster.
[109:56.69]One.
[109:56.95]Two.
[109:58.49]Three.
[110:01.19]Close enough.
[110:16.72]That wasn't even the right piece.
[110:23.86]Come on.
[110:27.44]Is it actually too short?
[110:41.34]2.9.
[110:41.44]Alright, fine.
[110:42.34]Let me just do this.
[110:52.30]Okay, just scaled all this.
[110:54.48]2.9.
[110:58.88]Thank God I scaled.
[111:21.82]Automatic log measurement.
[111:23.80]Thank goodness.
[111:27.56]Oh, thank God.
[111:29.30]What a disaster this would have been.
[111:33.08]Perfect.
[111:33.70]Okay, 2.9.
[111:46.29]Nice log, bro.
[111:47.57]You know what?
[111:47.93]I hate that people call shit a log.
[111:53.48]This... I hate it.
[111:55.50]It just seems so... so dumb and gross.
[111:59.12]It's just so awful.
[112:02.25]Alright, the rest of these look big.
[112:03.13]Except for this one.
[112:05.53]And that one.
[112:21.49]How is this too short?
[112:25.84]It's not.
[112:27.48]This is big.
[112:31.10]Too short.
[112:31.74]It's not too short.
[112:35.58]I gotta measure this again.
[112:36.64]Because, like, what the heck?
[112:37.58]4.7.
[112:40.08]Easy.
[112:40.24]4.7.
[112:40.26]Yep.
[112:56.53]There it is.
[112:57.11]We're seven.
[113:08.48]Okay.
[113:17.96]This one should fit too.
[113:18.83]What's that song from Red Dead?
[113:25.48]I love that song.
[113:25.96]I keep picking up the same piece of wood.
[113:27.68]In fact, just start over.
[113:30.38]Just give me another one.
[113:58.44]Need two that are how long Stop Stop Stop Or for whatever for or something I
[114:32.42]That should do it.
[114:34.89]Oh, fuck you.
[114:54.10]When are you going to ancient Egypt?
[114:56.84]I don't know.
[114:59.53]You also prefer the next logs in the same way.
[115:00.92]You're cutting another tree, you debark them.
[115:02.96]More of this?
[115:07.20]Automatic laser measurement.
[115:10.38]Ooh.
[115:10.58]Alright, how long is this?
[115:14.98]These are all... Alright, thank you.
[115:17.12]Five... Alright, 4.6.
[115:18.40]4.6, 4.6, 4.6.
[115:20.02]I need four... This'll fit here.
[115:21.46]One of these will.
[115:31.83]Already got all this scrap.
[115:32.75]Might as well use it.
[115:38.21]Thank you.
[115:38.85]Thanks for the help.
[115:39.97]Thanks, Luigi.
[115:40.55]Okay, now this is... Alright, 4.6, 4.6, 4.6.
[115:48.11]Is a bear staring at me?
[116:03.95]That's a cat or there's just pigs There's no bear
[116:33.53]No, that's a pig, guys.
[116:34.67]This is like a warthog.
[116:40.77]Can't do it.
[116:52.16]Shaving them automatically?
[117:01.86]Oh, you can fuck up by 30%, perfect.
[117:03.28]Yep, we're good.
[117:11.23]Oh, hell yeah.
[117:12.83]It doesn't even matter, Luigi's gonna help me.
[117:21.89]That's so incorrect.
[117:30.67]Alright, what about over here?
[117:38.83]If it's too long, they just end up cutting it and helping you, so it's fine.
[117:47.82]Watch out, there's a hare- there's a harebrine.
[117:52.48]Oh no.
[118:03.16]One more.
[118:03.50]Herobrine.
[118:16.03]What does Herobrine even do?
[118:17.21]Doesn't he, like, stare at you with red eyes or something?
[118:20.65]And he, like, kills you?
[118:24.32]He's a huge... Okay, more of this.
[118:27.72]Okay.
[118:33.48]I didn't know how to put that there.
[118:34.78]That's weird.
[118:44.48]Get out of here!
[118:48.70]Get out!
[118:49.26]Oh!
[119:05.32]there's not a bear I'm actually glad that's doing this because I can just put these two here be sure not on this one alright one more am I gonna have to start making actual planks
[119:37.04]There's even more.
[119:38.12]That does sound like Joel.
[119:41.49]Like a lot.
[119:48.87]Okay, I gotta put some more logs down here.
[119:50.98]I think it's... Honestly, I think it's time to do this.
[119:55.24]I have to cut down just, like, ten trees and just stack them over here.
[119:59.94]Are you gonna play Cruelty Squad?
[120:02.74]I don't know.
[120:04.44]I don't have, like, a plan to, but maybe.
[120:14.89]You got this?
[120:15.39]I appreciate the score.
[120:17.17]Thank you.
[120:23.46]So also keep in mind, we also have AI Dungeon.
[120:26.84]Something that I'm gonna be playing probably soon here.
[120:28.38]I have Novel AI and AI Dungeon.
[120:32.41]Both ready to go.
[120:39.97]Like I said before, I kind of like this.
[120:42.12]Play something for a few hours, move to something else for like an hour or two, play something for an hour.
[120:45.76]I kind of like it.
[120:47.64]Now obviously some games are not, you can't do that.
[120:51.34]I kind of like this.
[120:52.02]It's fun.
[120:52.74]It's fun to jump around.
[120:53.38]I'm going to say two more.
[121:05.26]I still need another coffee.
[121:10.60]Rosie Squad has stocks.
[121:12.89]Really?
[121:15.03]You mean I can trade?
[121:16.07]I think that's good.
[121:22.69]Could be three more?
[121:35.99]Too short.
[121:36.55]Oh my goodness.
[121:42.75]This is next level.
[121:50.36]Alright, still need the big ones.
[121:51.50]Yep.
[121:55.30]That's too short.
[121:55.86]There we go.
[121:56.34]How many can I carry?
[122:01.24]I can carry this many?
[122:03.26]I didn't know that.
[122:05.43]Graphics are all that matter in video games.
[122:08.65]Um, not really.
[122:09.95]I would disagree with you on that.
[122:12.77]One of the most fun I've ever had was a game that looked like it was from like 2004.
[122:19.07]Like 2006. 2006.
[122:25.05]Some games are like 2D pixel graphics and I find them amazing.
[122:31.59]Companies care way too much about graphics.
[122:34.73]Way too much.
[122:35.13]They're the driving factor for the huge amount of things that you play.
[122:49.95]What about Mario Super Star Baseball?
[122:52.01]Mario Strikers is... I'm looking forward to that.
[122:55.75]That game was amazing.
[122:59.03]Especially when they had a sequel, right?
[123:00.65]It was really good.
[123:08.53]What are some of the things I'm looking forward to?
[123:11.45]Elden Ring, obviously.
[123:14.45]When does Elden Ring come out?
[123:16.81]When is the actual launch on Steam?
[123:28.79]Yeah, but what time?
[123:33.24]Who knows?
[123:34.56]I wonder if it's going to be like 1 p.m.
[123:36.50]or something, or if it's opening at midnight the day before.
[123:38.52]It's supposed to be on the 24th.
[123:49.17]Probably Thursday at 9.
[123:50.95]Hmm.
[123:59.39]I'm definitely not, I'm not doing a midnight launch release thingy, no.
[124:08.43]I got these really good sections here.
[124:16.86]This is a very type of craft beer.
[124:18.06]I don't really drink craft beer.
[124:21.98]I don't drink really beer at all.
[124:25.77]Every time I drink beer, I take two or three sips out of it when it's really cold.
[124:30.13]And I go, ooh.
[124:33.17]Mmm.
[124:33.47]Oh, that's good.
[124:35.05]Oh, man.
[124:35.69]Guys, mine's good.
[124:37.43]What'd you get?
[124:37.95]Oh, mine's the orange peel.
[124:39.78]The orange peel.
[124:40.24]What's it?
[124:40.82]I don't have any fucking idea.
[124:41.86]I just picked one.
[124:43.48]Oh, it's the orange peel IPA from Germany.
[124:46.80]Yeah.
[124:48.14]And then it gets kind of a little warmer.
[124:49.80]And I don't like to drink it, but I have to.
[124:53.02]Because it's like, you don't, you can't like order a full beer in like the nice glass.
[124:58.10]Take two sips of it and just stare at it.
[124:59.93]Like, I don't, you have to get at least halfway done.
[125:04.35]Right?
[125:06.39]So, um, also, I don't know why everyone's so weird.
[125:09.63]Why are we so weird?
[125:12.07]Humans are a weird group of animals.
[125:13.73]Wait, what?
[125:16.39]Oh.
[125:18.82]I know we, like, want other people to enjoy the things we enjoy.
[125:24.13]But do we really have to say that you think the ketchup is house-made?
[125:28.95]Right?
[125:29.11]Like, oh, dude, no, this ketchup's house-made.
[125:31.95]No, it's not.
[125:34.47]It never is.
[125:38.75]Ever.
[125:39.49]Probably.
[125:39.95]Maybe in a few places.
[125:43.26]Like, dude, that honey mustard.
[125:44.92]Oh, man.
[125:46.50]Oh, man.
[125:47.86]They make that here.
[125:48.74]They make that in-house.
[125:51.16]I wonder how many times a restaurateur has heard that come from somebody and they just open up the fridge and there's just bottles of Heinz ketchup in there.
[126:02.29]Yeah, it sure is.
[126:06.01]I've never heard that.
[126:07.27]What are you talking about?
[126:08.37]Everybody says that.
[126:13.15]Like, oh, this beer?
[126:14.24]Oh, mm-hmm.
[126:15.84]I, mm, this is so good.
[126:18.44]Do you see where it's from?
[126:19.82]It's from, this is from Italy.
[126:24.04]Yeah, it is.
[126:32.10]Italian beer.
[126:34.66]Ranch, restaurant ranch.
[126:36.15]Oh, my God, it's so good.
[126:37.31]Oh, by the way, Ranch Andy's in chat.
[126:39.21]I got a bone to pick with you.
[126:40.77]I got a bone to pick with you guys.
[126:43.15]So, a few days ago, on this stream, we talked about how, oh, mayonnaise, ew, yuck, mayo.
[126:50.04]All you ranch enjoyers, I think, need to take a step back and evaluate how you feel about mayonnaise.
[126:58.96]Because if I, if you think that mayonnaise is gross, you better think that ranch is gross too.
[127:05.99]Because that shit is, like, kind of disgusting if you think about it, just like if you think about mayonnaise.
[127:16.63]unseasoned ranch uh-huh unseasoned ranch that's so funny excuse me sir would you like some unseasoned ranch please or mayonnaise
[127:45.48]Don't care, Omeglel, don't care.
[127:50.14]Ranch actually tastes good.
[127:51.44]No, ranch tastes like ranch.
[127:54.58]Mayo makes everything else taste better.
[128:02.64]Mayo brings out flavors.
[128:04.86]Ranch is ranch.
[128:10.89]Not that I'm saying I don't just, I dislike ranch, but I mean, I can't say I'm like, I love it.
[128:21.96]I'm actually one of those, uh, Giga Chad blue cheese enjoyers instead of ranch.
[128:27.48]I choose blue cheese every time.
[128:36.47]If there's a choice between blue cheese or ranch for like a dipping sauce for something, I'm going to choose blue cheese.
[128:40.61]I don't know.
[128:41.07]That's I can understand why people think blue cheese is gross, but it doesn't matter to me.
[128:47.54]I just, I know.
[128:49.46]Don't stop saying Giga Chad.
[128:52.70]You guys say it all the time.
[128:54.12]You don't think I'm going to like, at least absorb some of that.
[128:57.55]Of course I am.
[129:00.57]Aoli.
[129:01.05]Yep.
[129:02.73]Isn't that taste so good?
[129:04.03]That mayonnaise that has like other shit in it.
[129:06.37]Like there's like a... There's like they... They ground up some garlic and put it in mayonnaise.
[129:11.90]And you love it now?
[129:13.50]That's garlic mayonnaise.
[129:20.06]And holy smokes is that good.
[129:23.40]Ugh.
[129:25.10]I could eat... I could eat garlic mayo out of the jar.
[129:28.00]I probably could.
[129:31.15]Like oh just put it on bread.
[129:34.17]I think blue cheese is better than ranch.
[129:36.07]There's stuff that I would put ranch on instead of blue cheese though.
[129:43.32]Should I like do an eating stream where I like eat stuff and write it for you?
[129:49.04]I've seen people do this before.
[129:52.86]You want my real dog shit takes on everything?
[129:59.25]What's like a one that you'd want to see?
[130:09.35]Do TV dinners?
[130:12.49]Hmm.
[130:12.61]You want to do a TV dinner stream?
[130:17.55]Get a bunch of them?
[130:26.09]Do dog sausages.
[130:27.13]Dog treats.
[130:30.81]That's so stupid.
[130:33.33]Dog treat tier list live.
[130:40.19]So many people do like the taste test stuff.
[130:43.79]Imagine if I had like milk bones and like dog sausages and like canned dog food and shit and I sat there and I did that.
[130:56.41]With special guest Otto!
[130:59.37]Otto has to give his tier list.
[131:01.43]And how we do that is I take a few dog treats.
[131:04.73]I break them up so they're really small, right?
[131:06.11]So he doesn't get like too much.
[131:07.87]So break them up to the little small taste pieces.
[131:11.21]Put them out in a row far enough away from each other so he has to decide.
[131:17.38]I hold him back at like the other end of the room and go, okay, go Otto!
[131:22.48]And see what he goes for first.
[131:24.40]That is now elevated on the tier list.
[131:27.66]Right?
[131:29.69]So then that's up at, like, S tier.
[131:31.71]We put that next to another one, right?
[131:34.49]That he also likes, and we make a dog treat tier list.
[131:42.43]One thing I would want to make sure of, though, is that whatever it was, it was gonna be very, very small amounts.
[131:50.38]Like, tiny little pieces.
[131:52.36]Because I don't want to sit there and just, like, feed him bags of treats.
[132:01.48]He's saying this, but he's never gonna do it.
[132:03.18]No, don't you understand?
[132:05.28]Always remember the things I say.
[132:07.06]Because two years from now, I'm gonna spend $40,000 on this as a project.
[132:13.16]You know what I mean?
[132:13.80]Like, just wait a year or two.
[132:15.58]There'll be like a $70,000 stream where this happens.
[132:21.57]So just wait a few years.
[132:29.99]That would be actually kind of fun.
[132:33.29]As long as that was done right and I wasn't overfeeding him and overdoing it.
[132:36.26]I think that'd be funny.
[132:38.06]Make a dog treat tier list.
[132:45.36]No, but the thing is, I wouldn't just do the dog food tier list.
[132:50.44]Like, in the middle of that stream, Macho Man Randy Savage has to show up and, like, eat out of the can with his hands.
[132:57.84]And go like, ooh, yeah!
[132:59.44]And then leave.
[133:00.40]And, like, I just have to blow money on that stream.
[133:02.78]Right?
[133:03.00]Like, somebody has to come in and do something weird.
[133:09.19]Or, like, I have to, like, be like, come here, Ochoco!
[133:11.19]And I have to, like, fall out of my window.
[133:17.33]Like, it can't just be a stream where we just do something, like, basic like that.
[133:30.13]I'll think about it.
[133:30.73]I'll think about it.
[133:31.22]That sounds kind of like a fun idea.
[133:34.38]Then we'll find out once and for all.
[133:45.64]No, I'm not saying macho man.
[133:47.76]I'm saying like a celebrity or like a somebody or a thing needs to happen.
[133:52.25]That's not just auto-eating dog treats.
[134:00.83]This is coming along.
[134:13.36]Otto is a celebrity.
[134:14.44]You know, that's true.
[134:31.04]Okay, right here.
[134:36.96]I have to start to get in.
[134:37.68]I gotta use the ladder.
[134:45.03]Okay, for me, what would you guys want to see me eat if I were to do one of these?
[134:51.97]There's an endless amount of content here.
[134:53.35]What's a mess in here?
[134:57.02]Roots?
[134:58.74]Roots?
[135:01.33]Okay.
[135:03.05]I'm not going to eat dog food.
[135:04.51]No.
[135:20.55]Okay.
[135:22.79]Okay.
[135:23.23]I see a few decent ones.
[135:26.47]I see a few good ones.
[135:38.77]Is this long enough?
[135:41.66]I need a full tree for that one.
[135:42.94]There we go.
[135:50.68]A dipping sauce tier list.
[135:54.98]I'll start with one if you guys like it.
[135:56.71]And maybe I'll do another one.
[136:03.53]Canned soups.
[136:04.77]That's actually a really good one because that's really easy to make.
[136:09.57]That's legitimately just heating up soup.
[136:11.85]So I don't have to do a bunch of bullshit where... Yeah, I'm actually kind of into that one.
[136:16.71]You're gonna have too much sodium.
[136:25.98]Well, no, I'm not gonna eat like 40 cans of soup.
[136:30.62]I'm gonna portion it out so it's little taste test versions.
[136:35.68]cover them up, put them in the fridge, and then be able to eat them over the course of like a week, or like a month.
[136:42.16]However long I can keep it in the fridge for.
[136:43.52]Guys, when they do the Coca-Cola versus Pepsi taste test, you don't drain a two liter to make that decision.
[136:54.61]Contrary to what the commercials of a lot of those products would like you to believe, how many soda commercials do you see where they just tip the thing up and fucking slam it?
[137:05.43]Every time I see that happen, I go, ow!
[137:07.89]That hurts.
[137:17.73]It's always like in the middle of a jingle, right?
[137:19.25]It's like, cool, refreshing taste!
[137:22.38]And they... It's like a guy on a beach.
[137:26.20]Tips it back, his head slams back, and he is like...
[137:42.05]An ocean water tier list?
[137:51.18]Like the Atlantic versus the Pacific?
[137:55.64]Go to like the Red Sea and be on camera.
[137:58.36]Alright, here we are.
[137:59.54]Let's find out where this fits.
[138:05.67]Oh, this one tastes a little bit different.
[138:07.85]This one's a little nutty.
[138:16.80]Let me tell you, that's a way for a YouTuber to write off a huge vacation, okay?
[138:21.87]So just be aware of that.
[138:24.99]Oh, where?
[138:25.51]I'm going to travel the whole world to take sips out of different bodies of water.
[138:32.05]Isn't that crazy?
[138:33.05]I have to go to 30 countries.
[138:38.96]Oh.
[138:40.76]It's for the video, man.
[138:56.41]It's deductions.
[138:58.23]Oy.
[139:05.37]This house just looks like uncooked hot dogs.
[139:13.38]Oh, breadsticks.
[139:15.94]This house is making me hungry.
[139:17.22]It just looks like breadsticks.
[139:21.84]I want to dump some fucking ranch on these things here.
[139:23.88]You know what I mean?
[139:28.61]What about a cereal tier list?
[139:30.85]Yeah, but I already know where I stand on that.
[139:33.53]I know completely where I stand.
[139:44.40]I already did that?
[139:45.14]Yeah, but I mean, I didn't eat the cereal on stream.
[139:52.76]What about like a Yankee candle tier list?
[139:56.76]Or like a bed, bath, and beyond candle tier list.
[139:59.32]I just sit there and I'm like, oh, this one's alright.
[140:02.40]I feel like that would suck.
[140:14.15]You would never get the smell out of that room.
[140:20.44]Crayon, you just made me spit on my monitor.
[140:23.42]Crayon flavor tier list.
[140:25.04]Like I think they're flavors.
[140:28.32]I don't think that they're just like fun names for colors.
[140:33.10]And actually talk, make them out of something that's edible.
[140:36.46]Like have a fake box of like 500 crayons made, lay them all out and eat them.
[140:41.48]And, but they're actually made out of like an edible material that I can eat.
[140:46.53]That would freak out a ton.
[140:47.75]A lot of people would be fucking freaked out by that big time.
[140:53.93]I actually might get like a message from Twitch like, hey, what are you doing?
[140:57.85]Stop doing this.
[140:58.41]He's all too short.
[141:18.51]Okay, looks good.
[141:21.19]How often do you get those messages?
[141:23.55]Um... Okay.
[141:29.72]But this is a cool idea, and I don't want to just ruin it and leak it in case I ever do it.
[141:37.36]I don't want to, like, leak it and talk about the whole entire thing, because I think it's really funny.
[141:41.30]And one day I might actually be able to do it, right?
[141:44.24]It's possible.
[141:45.88]So I don't want to, like, leak what it is.
[141:48.50]Maybe I've talked about it a little bit before, but I... Just in case that this stream actually happens... Ever...
[141:58.24]I'm gonna hold on to it, but yeah, there was something that I wanted to do.
[142:03.66]But it was just like, mmm, not a big fan.
[142:08.07]But I think we could have done it.
[142:09.89]I think we might have had to tweak it a little bit.
[142:16.25]It's nothing like, nothing bad.
[142:17.65]It's nothing not bad.
[142:18.55]Nothing like, like, uh, like violent or awful or anything.
[142:22.76]No, nothing like that.
[142:24.48]Nothing like, like sexual or, no, no, no, no, no.
[142:28.62]It was just something that didn't sit completely well.
[142:33.86]Which, I mean, for very obvious reasons, right?
[142:47.53]But they're not obvious to us.
[142:51.03]But this is such a... I love this idea.
[142:53.48]I can't...
[142:57.15]I don't, it's nothing bad, and it's not like, oh my god, you can't do this.
[143:00.38]No, it's just we had to be, like, kind of careful with it because we didn't want to make it seem like it was really happening.
[143:05.74]That's what it came down to.
[143:06.70]No, no leaks.
[143:19.05]You already know the baseball stream is coming up in, like, a couple months.
[143:22.56]So, no, no leaks.
[143:25.65]I've already leaked way too much of that stream.
[143:31.45]I don't care what people say about that stream.
[143:33.77]It's going to be one of my favorites.
[143:34.85]Ever.
[143:37.31]I can't wait to do that stream.
[143:39.07]You have no idea.
[143:40.44]I can't wait.
[143:42.08]Just for me.
[143:43.06]That stream's for me.
[143:43.76]Okay?
[143:44.94]No, it's for YouTube.
[143:58.06]This is coming along.
[144:02.01]No furs.
[144:02.57]No leaks.
[144:03.15]No furs.
[144:08.85]Someone in chat said it.
[144:10.31]Yes.
[144:12.23]Someone in chat has talked about it.
[144:13.39]Because I have talked about it before.
[144:17.43]Very briefly.
[144:18.61]I didn't go into details of what it meant, but... I don't know.
[144:22.09]It was gonna be funny.
[144:29.58]But I didn't do that stream, not because I didn't have like permission to.
[144:36.21]It was just that other stuff really became way more important to take care of and do.
[144:43.63]And it became one of those streams that just fell through the cracks, maybe temporarily until some of the other stuff get done.
[144:54.26]Oh, it wasn't a car accident thing.
[144:58.79]Fortnite vape stream.
[145:04.01]I will do that stream one day before I retire for real.
[145:08.77]I'm gonna do the vape guy playing Fortnite joke.
[145:12.52]I'm gonna.
[145:14.06]I don't know when, I don't know how, but I'm gonna do that stream.
[145:23.56]The daycare stream.
[145:31.92]Okay.
[145:33.72]I'll talk, okay, I'm gonna talk about it because it's stupid.
[145:38.74]Community Jake told me, also, that this is probably a bad idea, let's not do it.
[145:42.61]And I was like, okay, fine.
[145:46.13]There was a stream idea a while back where I announced to the stream that I was operating a daycare.
[145:53.96]And that, guys, you know, I'm just trying to make some extra money on the side here.
[145:57.18]I'm operating a daycare.
[145:59.19]And I'm going to be operating it.
[146:00.57]And we got these children here.
[146:02.35]I'm going to be taking care of them.
[146:04.27]And it was going to be, like...
[146:07.23]Like, a half dozen, like, babies in, like, baby things back here.
[146:12.80]And I was going to periodically, because they were going to be those babies that, like, made the sounds and stuff, and, like, I had to go feed them, and it was going to be like, look, I'm feeding the babies thing.
[146:21.80]Where it went off the rails is some crazy stuff was going to happen, where, like, a bear was going to fucking attack my office.
[146:28.54]And I was gonna have to, like, defend the babies from a bear and shit.
[146:31.94]And, like, crazy stuff was gonna happen.
[146:33.30]I was gonna have to, like, fight for them and fight against them.
[146:35.54]They were gonna, like, be able to vote for what I was gonna play next on stream.
[146:40.67]They're not real babies.
[146:42.17]Like, dolls.
[146:43.49]What are you talking about?
[146:49.23]Like, small infant baby dolls that just sit back here.
[146:52.57]And I'm, like, running a daycare.
[147:00.44]And I have to, like, defend them from, like... Oh, a bear's coming in!
[147:04.87]And I fight the bear, and, like, maybe one of the babies, like, gets up and, like, attacks the bear and shit.
[147:11.37]That sounds awesome, though.
[147:18.84]But it got to a point where I was like, you know what?
[147:20.74]This probably isn't... This probably isn't a great idea.
[147:23.90]And Community Jake is just like, yeah, let's, like, leave this one on the cutting room floor because, like, I don't think that this is gonna work.
[147:29.76]And I'm like, yeah, you know what?
[147:30.66]This probably is gonna be hard to make work.
[147:42.69]Who would possibly worry about it being real?
[147:44.63]Well, not that it was real, but I don't know.
[147:49.97]Especially if, like, the babies were gonna be back here, like, making noises while I was sitting here, like, talking and, like, streaming.
[147:56.98]I mean, look, let me be honest.
[147:58.18]Is that as bad as me wanting to do another one that got shut down?
[148:02.16]Another one that got shut down?
[148:04.13]Is that I wanted to do the second Catboy stream and I wanted to shit in the litter box that was in the corner of the room?
[148:10.25]Is that the same?
[148:11.47]Is that just as bad?
[148:17.57]That one got shut down, too.
[148:30.99]It's so much worse.
[148:36.59]You guys don't know.
[148:37.39]There's a lot of ideas that pass through like a small treatment.
[148:44.45]That me and Community Jake will sit in a call for like an hour.
[148:48.74]And we'll be like, yeah, man, okay, so for the second Catboy stream, what if there was like just cat toys around the room and I'm like running around chasing them.
[148:55.74]Maybe like chat can pick on like what toy I play with.
[148:58.96]Like there'll be a big cat tree that I climb up and like sleep on and just sit there for like 10 straight minutes.
[149:05.44]Oh, and there'll be like a litter box too.
[149:07.10]And like maybe I'll go over to the litter box and maybe I'll shit in the litter box.
[149:10.40]And it's just like, whoa, whoa, hold on a minute, Jeremy.
[149:13.52]Back up for a second.
[149:14.26]What do you want to do?
[149:15.88]And I'm like, well, no, I'm just saying, like, I'm just trying to think of, like, things, like, funny shit to do.
[149:22.00]I wouldn't actually, guys, I wouldn't have actually shit in a litter box on stream.
[149:27.73]It would be, like, I would just go be a cat in the litter box.
[149:32.95]And, like, that would be, and, like, that would be it.
[149:34.10]Like, you're like, oh, I'm gonna go to BRB.
[149:35.88]He's, like, using the litter box.
[149:46.91]I can't reach this.
[149:51.34]You need to fire community Jake.
[149:54.34]No.
[149:54.60]I'm sorry.
[149:56.00]I'm trying to think of all this stuff that I kind of thought of would be like kind of funny for a second and then I'm like no actually maybe I don't think I really want to do that one.
[150:11.57]What else?
[150:12.21]Stop cutting logs.
[150:14.83]Oh fuck I am.
[150:15.67]You're right.
[150:20.68]What about the ASMR?
[150:21.28]Yeah, the ASMR stream too.
[150:24.38]That's another one that's gone.
[150:26.34]That was the one where I wanted to have a marching band come in in the middle of the stream and like while I'm still talking.
[150:36.94]That was another one where I wanted to, I wanted to like shave.
[150:41.42]Do like a, oh, it's you're at the barber getting shaved.
[150:50.25]Stop giving up on these good ideas.
[150:53.84]I mean, here's the... No, look.
[150:57.56]A lot of stuff hits the cutting room floor.
[150:59.64]For various reasons.
[151:09.43]I'm gonna have full creative control, in quotes, LOL.
[151:14.42]Guys, I think that backtracking on the I'm gonna shit in a litter box on stream joke is not what you are describing right there with what you just said.
[151:27.35]I think that it's very reasonable that I would maybe be like, maybe not.
[151:32.09]Maybe not that one.
[151:39.72]He's not, he's brand friendly.
[151:50.40]You came up with the idea.
[151:51.54]I have a notebook.
[151:58.22]I have a notebook that I just write shit in.
[152:04.06]I fill it with shit.
[152:12.31]This is way too tall.
[152:22.77]That's gotta be it, right?
[152:23.61]There we go.
[152:24.05]What did you say?
[152:28.90]You said what?
[152:29.26]I wanna see, I wanna see, I wanna see.
[152:35.77]A few years ago, you talked on Critical's podcast about the courtroom thing.
[152:40.31]What was that?
[152:40.75]Alright, I can talk about that.
[152:43.73]I was going to go on trial for killing Santa Claus.
[152:46.96]And we were going to have a courtroom, and I was going to be on trial for it.
[152:50.68]But it wasn't going to be like a normal court.
[152:52.06]It was going to be kind of like a magical court.
[152:54.76]And Santa's lawyer was going to sing his prosecution at the jury and shit, and I was going to get pissed off and
[153:02.23]It was going to be like a magical Christmas stream where I'm just this evil fucking awful person.
[153:08.79]And the problem, there was a lot of stuff that was going to happen on that stream.
[153:15.26]Unfortunately, I kind of ran out of time because that was also right in the period where I was going to start to move.
[153:24.67]That was right before moving to Vegas.
[153:26.97]And the you killed Santa routine wasn't really relevant anymore.
[153:31.36]And like a year goes by, two years go by.
[153:34.22]And I think in the chat I made jokes about, oh, you know, the legal system sure does take a long time or something, but it never ended up happening.
[153:46.39]What's happening?
[153:46.89]What am I doing?
[153:55.48]How many logs did I pick up?
[153:58.44]How many logs do I have?
[153:59.80]This is what I need, right?
[154:18.83]Oh shit.
[154:20.19]How many do I- How many of these do I have?
[154:28.69]Ooh, cool.
[154:34.63]But yeah, stuff hits the cutting room floor.
[154:36.47]What are the other things I could probably think of?
[154:38.95]What's another one that I was like, nah, probably not.
[154:44.65]There is one that I actually still want to do, and it's the one we originally brought up.
[154:52.43]Alright, this is going to drive me insane.
[154:55.75]The one that was originally brought up is not the one... I haven't said it yet.
[155:04.53]Because I think that one actually might still happen.
[155:06.43]It's possible.
[155:09.91]So I'm not going to spoil that one.
[155:10.93]I'll spoil the ones that are guaranteed to not happen.
[155:18.11]Like the Jerma daycare stream.
[155:32.38]Oh yeah, there was the chocolate factory stream where I was gonna go and pretend like I had a chocolate factory and do this whole Willy Wonka routine where we had to eliminate people or something.
[155:41.77]I don't know what the f- I don't know what the fuck's wrong with me sometimes.
[156:01.01]Okay, looks good.
[156:04.32]More planks.
[156:04.92]Give me.
[156:07.80]What about your book?
[156:09.88]Yeah.
[156:13.08]I know.
[156:13.38]I'm aware.
[156:18.09]Eliminate people like you get eliminated from like Willy Wonka.
[156:34.94]I need more of these planks.
[156:37.65]30 webcam stream.
[156:38.61]That was another one.
[156:39.39]Yeah.
[156:54.53]Who will replace me stuff should have been streamers.
[156:58.11]Well, the reason why I wanted it to be... Actors.
[157:02.41]And not, like, other streamers.
[157:03.55]Is because... It... I don't know.
[157:07.81]Having it be other streamers almost feels... Like, it's too... Having actors is almost more real to me.
[157:15.58]Because, like, I wouldn't have another streamer take.
[157:18.30]Like, they're already a streamer.
[157:24.26]Like, if I... Oh, let's get a bunch of, like, streamers together to do this.
[157:27.18]It'd be... Like, these are just streamers that you know.
[157:31.02]You don't know any of those actors.
[157:33.22]Maybe you did.
[157:33.66]I don't know.
[157:33.92]What do you mean, actors?
[157:37.32]I mean, the actors that came in to try to take my role from me.
[157:49.66]So, I mean...
[157:53.51]Thankfully.
[157:54.31]They were actors?
[157:55.09]Yeah.
[157:55.27]What are you talking about?
[158:03.47]I got a bunch of actors together.
[158:05.77]To see, like, who could do me the best.
[158:09.82]It came down to... We didn't really need them.
[158:14.36]Because I wasn't ready.
[158:20.22]And we had a little bullshit happen at the end of that stream.
[158:28.43]And thankfully, I was able to, you know, do what I needed to do and prove my case to whoever I needed to prove it to.
[158:34.43]Of course, like Dr. Schmoikson and Ludwig and those guys.
[158:36.63]And they took care of that fucking weird guy.
[158:38.89]That weird actor.
[158:39.89]Yeah, that was like an actor.
[158:54.64]They got rid of the actor and I get to continue to do what I want to do.
[159:00.03]And I'm not gone yet.
[159:01.12]I don't have to stop.
[159:01.88]Like, I'm fine.
[159:17.30]Yeah, somebody was shot.
[159:19.19]What?
[159:19.85]I mean, we figured it out.
[159:21.19]We got the right person.
[159:22.31]It's easy.
[159:23.27]You are... Everybody already knows that.
[159:27.81]You could see through.
[159:28.59]It was clear as day.
[159:32.70]I'm trying to put forth, like, the illusion.
[159:34.32]You know, of... I mean, obviously, I don't want people to think I'm, like, retiring.
[159:41.24]I'm not.
[159:43.70]I'm just still going.
[159:53.47]Ster shot you on purpose.
[159:56.31]Nobody shot me, okay?
[160:00.59]I did not- nobody shot me.
[160:02.51]I watched as somebody was being a little ridiculous and... Game was rigged from the start.
[160:23.53]You're not the real Jerma.
[160:25.65]Then who am I then?
[160:26.65]Huh?
[160:28.63]I'm not the real Jerma?
[160:29.47]What about a hot cup of cider?
[160:31.97]Hot cup of coffee?
[160:33.95]What?
[160:35.45]Hot cup of cider!
[160:41.54]How much more do I need to prove that I'm real?
[160:50.38]This is long, huh?
[160:54.92]Eren!
[160:58.65]Let me tell you something really important though.
[161:02.33]If that was to be a show where that would happen, right?
[161:06.51]My favorite part of that show, 100%, besides obviously like the Eren stuff, is the fact that some, you know, people were given material
[161:19.36]To potentially look at and see kind of, you know, who that person could be and what's that person like on camera.
[161:26.03]They may have had a whole package made for them, right?
[161:28.23]If that were the case.
[161:30.53]And the fact that... Oh, she's got cider!
[161:35.54]Hot cup of coffee!
[161:36.86]Hot cup of cocoa!
[161:39.30]Is the thing, like, the AI was given one thing and then wrote a book about it, right?
[161:46.67]That's my favorite part is oh yeah hot cup of cider.
[161:50.95]That's what I do.
[161:51.89]That's me It's so I love it so much oh So welcome.
[161:59.84]How are you?
[162:00.40]Oh?
[162:00.52]Yeah, hot cup of cocoa.
[162:02.06]Oh, yeah, that's me.
[162:02.80]That's what I do.
[162:03.58]That's my thing That's all I do ah So I loved it Can I get a look at me, please
[162:14.46]turning the best part is how everybody wanted to play Dark Souls and Here okay, so here's some lore on that stream a lot of those guys didn't know anything about Dark Souls didn't even know what it was So watching them struggle with like the mouse and like trying to swing and like take One after one by one by one they would come in I'm gonna be playing Dark Souls
[162:42.63]Like, oh, okay.
[162:44.99]I don't think you want to do that.
[162:52.33]Getting into, like, the tutorial room.
[162:56.19]And then Octopimp comes in and just, like, beats it first try.
[162:59.63]That was so goddamn funny.
[163:06.13]No, I loved that.
[163:06.89]That was so much fun.
[163:07.67]Again, if you, if you don't know what we're talking about, or if you do all those audio problems and all like the stream lagging problems, we had like Twitch server issues as well as like kind of issues with, um, our connection, like at the venue.
[163:21.92]So a lot of those random audio issues that would like, most of those are gone in the VOD that's on the archive channel.
[163:35.34]So it still pops up a little bit, but not even remotely close as much as it did before.
[163:45.63]Okay.
[163:45.99]I got to stop like walking up and down the ladder and actually do this.
[163:50.27]I need them to be thin like that.
[163:56.63]Okay.
[163:57.01]We just need to cut down a bunch of trees.
[163:58.50]Got it.
[164:01.70]They got to be long.
[164:02.34]Okay.
[164:10.43]Speedrun.
[164:26.87]Is there any behind-the-scenes stuff from that show?
[164:29.49]Oh, there might be.
[164:30.31]I think there's a few things, yeah.
[164:33.14]I know that, um... I know Holly had some behind-the-scenes stuff.
[164:36.58]I think there's a few videos and some pictures and stuff that she had.
[164:39.40]Maybe we'll see.
[164:42.42]You know what I also have, which I just realized the other day?
[164:44.69]I have... Do not... I don't want you to do that.
[164:49.53]Stop.
[164:53.13]I have a bunch of cut Bugleberry hot tub footage.
[164:59.15]Of stuff that was not in there.
[165:01.75]Was not on that stream.
[165:09.74]Maybe I'll, like, cut that up and just show it.
[165:18.41]Come here.
[165:22.33]Release the Bugleberry footage.
[165:29.82]No, stop doing this.
[165:31.10]There's so many of these planks now.
[165:41.99]The Elbertson cut.
[165:52.70]How many do I need?
[165:53.24]One, two, three, four, five?
[165:54.16]Like, one more.
[165:56.60]That'll do it.
[166:09.42]And then I think, this is pretty close.
[166:10.80]I just have to put on the top layer.
[166:15.24]Are these planks?
[166:16.42]Okay, I actually have a lot of planks already.
[166:25.40]Good thing I had these cut.
[166:34.03]This is a chill game.
[166:35.33]Even though it's very, very simple.
[166:38.09]I don't know.
[166:38.59]It's cool.
[166:39.19]I like it.
[166:47.28]Is this what actually a house looks like?
[166:48.54]How come it's so engaging?
[166:55.15]It just is.
[166:55.59]I don't know.
[166:56.03]Something about it.
[166:57.55]It's really nice.
[166:58.13]I love playing games like these on stream.
[167:01.51]It allows for some... We can just talk about whatever.
[167:06.19]It's fun.
[167:09.62]We can just sit in the background while we just talk.
[167:12.82]It's fun.
[167:18.52]Oh, over here.
[167:24.55]Oh, I need one more.
[167:25.41]There we go.
[167:25.71]Now it's time for the roof.
[167:31.53]These are planks as well.
[167:33.15]Oh shit, it's a lot of planks.
[167:34.31]Alright.
[167:35.71]Start the process.
[167:51.02]Got it.
[167:51.26]My favorite was the one that did the Yoda impression.
[167:58.78]Yeah, he's great.
[167:59.86]They were all great, though.
[168:01.27]They were.
[168:01.71]They were all so cool about everything.
[168:03.97]They were all so fun.
[168:08.71]They're incredibly talented, too.
[168:15.23]It's cool to... Because a lot of those guys were just kind of... We just had a casting company help us find all those actors.
[168:23.56]And it's crazy to see just how people have so many interesting things that they can do.
[168:29.25]Talents, things that they think are funny, things that they can do.
[168:34.53]I love that shit.
[168:35.17]I think it's really cool.
[168:36.15]I love doing that.
[168:38.68]So, another reason why, like, okay, like, for a lot of these things, could I just have, like, a few, like, streamers do it?
[168:43.73]I mean, yeah.
[168:44.79]But I think it's more fun to, like, see, like, other, what other people are doing.
[168:49.47]And have some, like, kind of actors that you don't really know.
[168:51.63]People that you don't see on stream.
[168:53.15]Be able to show them doing stuff.
[168:55.42]I mean, that's a huge reason why, like, I mean, obviously Dr. Spoykson.
[169:01.78]Like, Dr. Spoykson is awesome.
[169:08.91]And he's an incredibly nice, wonderful person.
[169:14.45]And years ago, just kind of like, just roped him into the channel.
[169:21.21]And he's just been kind of here ever since.
[169:27.53]It was awesome.
[169:28.49]When I knew that I was going to do that show, I was like, okay, I need judges.
[169:32.61]Who do I want to judge that?
[169:34.62]And then the very obvious choices are like, okay, who like streamer friends and
[169:39.54]Like, obviously, like, Styr, right?
[169:40.94]Styr, obviously, has been around for a very long time.
[169:43.70]If somebody knows, in quotes, Jerma, it's gonna be Styr.
[169:47.45]It's gonna be people like Styr, Etalyx, and, like, Ludwig.
[169:51.83]Ludwig is, like, kind of... Like, in the last few years, I kind of really started to talk to him and get to know him a little better.
[169:58.71]So it's kind of like old Jerma985, new Jerma985, and then, like, Dr. Schmoikson.
[170:07.80]It was just fun.
[170:08.50]It was really cool.
[170:09.18]I loved it.
[170:10.44]I told you that that was going to be one of my favorite streams, and it was.
[170:14.30]I had so much fun doing that show.
[170:17.44]I'm, like, sad it's gone, and I want to do it.
[170:19.07]Like, I want to do it again.
[170:30.94]Who is Dr. Schmoikson?
[170:32.62]I mean, it's Dr. Schmoikson.
[170:34.96]You don't...
[170:36.82]The doc.
[170:37.42]The doctor.
[170:43.52]But that's a whole... We talked about Evolved earlier in this stream and how I'm signed with Evolved.
[170:50.05]It's to be able to do more stuff like that and have shows paid for, have brands be able to come in and help.
[170:57.05]I want to do that stuff.
[170:58.49]That stuff means more to me than anything else.
[171:02.05]I think you guys are... You guys know that.
[171:03.57]I don't think I have to explain that.
[171:11.19]I love what I'm doing right now, because this is its own different kind of beast.
[171:15.75]Right?
[171:16.65]Sitting here, streaming a game, chilling, talking, just fucking around, making jokes, whatever.
[171:21.76]But, like, I will always remember all those shows.
[171:25.98]And you're probably noticing behind me on the Reddit shelf, I put, once a show is done, I put it up there.
[171:34.05]I put, like, a little token on the shelf.
[171:37.34]Just not for any reason, just because it's like, oh yeah, it's a fun kind of memory of remembering that, oh yeah, I remember doing that, that was cool.
[171:47.64]What about the dagger?
[171:48.61]I mean, that was not supposed to be on there, it was just there temporarily.
[171:52.63]So, I know people are probably like, why is there like a fucking dagger?
[171:56.73]What is the dagger for?
[172:06.24]And I mean, maybe it is like a little cheesy, like a little corny, whatever.
[172:11.00]But I don't know, it's nice to walk in the room and be like, oh yeah, that was fun.
[172:21.77]Let us see it?
[172:22.73]Sure.
[172:26.43]I mean, there's a new addition.
[172:28.37]There is a new addition.
[172:30.15]There's a couple up there that I think I would want to put something up there for, but I haven't.
[172:40.85]as you see you notice something up there yeah like you got and it's like streams that I like really had a great time with if you notice on the I don't think I've really talked about this it's kind of interesting because I don't think I've ever said this look at the games that are up there too right the thing is on there the movies is on there seaman is up there
[173:08.46]Yeah, the Funko Pops are kind of being pushed out.
[173:14.16]But yeah, most of that stuff is like, oh, this is stuff that I streamed that I thought was cool.
[173:17.75]Or that was fun.
[173:22.59]One of the rocks from Archeology.
[173:23.73]Of course, Pac-Man, the Wii.
[173:26.25]I think, what's down there?
[173:27.21]I can't remember.
[173:30.21]Where's the Fedora?
[173:32.95]Up there.
[173:36.13]I think there's a couple other things I should put up there.
[173:42.09]From the New Year's stream.
[173:46.28]Oh, yeah.
[173:46.52]The goat's from the carnival.
[173:48.74]The book and the potion is from the hot tub.
[173:50.98]The hat's from the last one.
[173:53.06]The replacement stream.
[173:55.32]985 is dollhouse, obviously.
[173:56.50]Grotto Beasts is right next to it.
[173:57.64]Seaman is right there.
[173:59.64]The archaeology thing is right there.
[174:01.12]The big geode.
[174:05.13]I'm surprised nobody's noticed this one.
[174:07.15]You see what's all the way on the left?
[174:08.61]On the 1, 2, 3 on the third shelf?
[174:10.45]Can you guys see what that is?
[174:17.22]It's a rat.
[174:17.64]Yeah, it's a rat with a Christmas hat on.
[174:20.98]There's a blue toothbrush sitting on him.
[174:32.39]Yeah, I mean, it's a little corny, maybe.
[174:35.01]It's a little corny.
[174:37.91]Well, I don't know.
[174:38.63]You know what's going to be sad?
[174:39.73]Like, I don't know, taking that down.
[174:42.49]Right?
[174:48.92]Oh, time to get existential and time to get real again.
[174:52.68]Uh-oh.
[174:54.60]I mean, a lot of you guys know that.
[174:58.04]I mean, I'm not going to do this forever.
[175:01.12]And how I decide on when and how that I'm going to do something else from here, I don't know what that looks like yet.
[175:10.03]But eventually, eventually I need to start to figure that out.
[175:16.64]And I'm starting to piece together what I would want to do after this.
[175:33.73]Let's let him on the roof.
[175:34.63]Fuck it.
[175:41.12]On the other way.
[175:41.60]Alright, whatever.
[175:45.72]I just need planks.
[175:48.85]Yeah, like, what do I want to do?
[175:50.54]What do I want to continue to do?
[175:53.30]I have a few ideas.
[175:54.58]Things that I'd like to do where I wouldn't just, like, disappear completely, right?
[175:59.58]I don't know.
[175:59.94]I don't know what that looks like yet.
[176:02.09]But I... I made the reference and I made the kind of... I teased this in a way when I talked about, like, how I've been... My 10-year anniversary, which was last year.
[176:14.87]It's like, I don't know how much longer I'm going to do this, but I'm just going to keep doing it until I'm done.
[176:21.23]Whenever that is.
[176:21.81]I should run for president.
[176:30.29]No, I don't want to do that.
[176:44.47]But it's tricky because you spend so much time doing something, right?
[176:50.17]And it's something that you care about.
[176:51.33]Because there hasn't been... We talk about channel changes and trying to keep myself interested and keep myself going.
[177:01.08]I want to want to fucking be here in the chair and not feel like I have to be here in the chair, right?
[177:07.46]I think that kind of just goes to the reason why the whole sponsorship stuff and...
[177:12.88]Trying to make things easier on myself and... Guys, it's been a long time.
[177:20.06]To join the circus.
[177:21.04]Oh, these are too long.
[177:29.78]No, they're too short.
[177:30.71]Come on.
[177:32.51]Well, now I fucked this whole thing up.
[177:33.63]Come here.
[177:35.99]You're gonna make me cry.
[177:37.27]No, that's not the whole... That's not the intention.
[177:45.50]This house looks good.
[177:48.27]This guy can't stop talking about retiring.
[177:55.27]It's all he talks about.
[177:56.79]Well, I don't know.
[178:01.43]We talked about the Reddit shelf and all the things that are on it.
[178:03.82]And then thinking about the future.
[178:05.82]And then I put some more shows up there.
[178:08.26]But I ain't going anywhere.
[178:22.54]But realistically speaking, TM, I have to start to think about that stuff.
[178:31.47]I'm not 25 anymore.
[178:32.57]Right?
[178:35.39]I gotta start to think about what it means in the future.
[178:41.73]And if I say the word retirement one more time, I will gift community sex.
[178:58.36]It's still really fun for me.
[178:59.56]I'm still having a great time.
[179:01.12]It's still very much something I enjoy doing all the time.
[179:05.02]As long as I can continue to keep myself interested.
[179:08.42]And enjoy what I'm doing.
[179:09.51]Have a lot of fun.
[179:10.33]And be able to create those moments and memories for me.
[179:14.23]And for you too.
[179:15.55]I want everyone to enjoy this channel and this space, right?
[179:20.07]I'm still here.
[179:25.74]You've said all those things like 50 times by now.
[179:29.72]I'll make it 51.

[179:50.57]No, I'm just saying.
[179:52.22]This is a chill house stream.
[179:54.02]We talk about this stuff on the house streams.
[179:55.78]Impressive.
[180:09.53]I think this is done.
[180:13.78]There's more.
[180:14.54]How much more is there?
[180:15.38]What?
[180:20.00]Oh, here we go.
