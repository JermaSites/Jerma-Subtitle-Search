[00:02.26]Hello.
[00:05.01]Hey guys, welcome to the stream.
[00:06.49]Welcome to my first ever stream.
[00:11.67]I've been waiting to try something like that.
[00:14.45]I don't know.
[00:16.73]I got a headache.
[00:17.27]That's why I'm doing this.
[00:24.06]Oh, he's doing the Sans voice.
[00:25.38]Hey guys, how are you?
[00:28.36]Hold on.
[00:28.98]Hold on a second here.
[00:32.71]Yeah, sorry we're starting a lot later than usual.
[00:39.02]But, the reason for that... Ooh, let me move you over here.
[00:45.04]Reason for that is, I woke up this morning and just had a really annoying headache.
[00:50.29]It didn't really hurt that much, but it was just... It just was there.
[00:52.93]It just wouldn't go away.
[00:57.66]It's a pressure headache, so it was just messing with my ability to talk and think and like right in the front of my forehead, you know what I mean?
[01:05.28]It's called a hangover?
[01:06.38]I didn't drink anything last night.
[01:09.91]What?
[01:13.57]The last time I drank is on this stream.
[01:17.69]Like last week.
[01:20.95]I only drink... I really only drink probably like two or three times a month.
[01:26.68]Maybe.
[01:28.24]If that.
[01:31.22]What do you mean, sure?
[01:32.50]Every time I drink, you guys see it.
[01:42.56]Boxed wine?
[01:43.22]Yeah, but I was building a lab up for that.
[01:46.17]I had to do that.
[01:49.59]What about that time that I drank toilet water?
[01:54.83]Well... I mean that... I didn't drink actual toilet water.
[02:00.40]I was drinking water out of a sink.
[02:04.54]But, uh, tonight I'll give you a rundown of what we're doing here.
[02:07.76]So, tonight and possibly tomorrow we're gonna stream two days in a row.
[02:11.24]So, Katamari Damacy Reroll, the remake, remastering of the original Katamari game, just came out, so obviously that was one of my favorite games, uh, ever.
[02:25.79]And what are we even waiting for here?
[02:27.99]You know what I'm saying?
[02:30.77]What are we even waiting for?
[02:34.96]Here it is.
[02:41.83]All the original music, all the original levels.
[02:44.87]I played this game a shitload.
[02:45.77]This is my childhood.
[02:48.01]And here's the- those of you guys that don't know what the fuck the title means, sing it with me.
[02:52.36]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:57.40]Ruined.
[03:13.96]Alright, alright, alright.
[03:15.54]You know what we're doing.
[03:22.82]Yeah, this is my childhood, guys.
[03:25.08]When I grew up, uh... I was probably, I don't know, maybe... Like... Probably 20... 22 when this game came out?
[03:33.94]23, maybe?
[03:35.46]And, yeah, I... You know, I grew up with it.
[03:38.10]I was just a kid.
[03:44.20]I remember riding my bike around the neighborhood, hanging out with the neighborhood kids.
[03:49.12]Had a backwards ball cap on, a cool vest with Marty McFly on it.
[03:54.67]I was like 24.
[04:12.30]Me and all the other, like, neighborhood college kids, you know what I mean?
[04:17.17]Well, how old, what?
[04:18.85]When do you guys think that you get old?
[04:21.31]I'm just barely right now.
[04:25.34]I'm barely, like, turning into, I'm barely an adult.
[04:31.58]You don't really become an adult until you're, like, 38.
[04:34.82]I'm not there yet.
[04:40.87]I'm still just a kid!
[04:45.68]I saw the song from the TV commercials, and they told me when I was younger, this is not my fault, okay?
[04:52.02]Blame Toys R Us.
[04:54.90]Because I don't want to grow up, I'm a Toys R Us kid, but it was on TV every fucking day.
[04:59.00]And they were brainwashing me to say, don't ever be an adult, don't be an adult, be a kid forever.
[05:03.72]And I'm like, fuck, man, alright, I guess.
[05:17.21]You're barely becoming dumb when you're 30, I'm just kidding.
[05:19.25]But we're gonna play Katamari tonight and tomorrow.
[05:23.13]And then we're gonna take a day off on... what is today?
[05:27.23]So Monday, Tuesday, we'll take Wednesday off and maybe Thursday because Friday is gonna be the Birdhouse stream.
[05:33.34]I'm building up Birdhouse.
[05:38.32]Why don't we just listen to it again, huh?
[05:47.82]No, we don't need to see it again.
[05:50.06]Turn it up louder?
[05:50.70]Here it comes again.
[05:54.18]What if I just did this for like three hours?
[06:00.49]Do you agree to these terms and conditions?
[06:02.41]They weren't terms and conditions in the original game.
[06:04.35]This is like, this is absolutely a remake.
[06:07.71]Privacy policy.
[06:08.83]Didn't have to agree to this shit last time.
[06:12.15]And there he is, the King of Cosmos.
[06:16.11]Oh, hello Prince!
[06:17.39]This is the King.
[06:19.67]Long time no see.
[06:22.59]We thought today would be a good day for rolling the Katamari.
[06:26.13]The Prince.
[06:26.93]Ru, you want me to read this correctly?
[06:29.03]Alright, hold on.
[06:37.95]Where the first rolls, the second follows.
[06:40.51]Roll, roll, roll!
[06:43.15]For that purpose, all alone, we went to the bother, the bother of making this space.
[06:50.76]The king of all cosmos going to the bother just for... I can't read this.
[06:56.16]It's like too fucking cryptic and all over the place. ...
[07:07.03]We went to the bother.
[07:08.01]So we would like for you to start the rolling.
[07:13.65]But.
[07:15.01]But.
[07:16.35]First things first.
[07:20.25]But.
[07:21.11]First things first.
[07:23.06]Does the prince like vibration?
[07:27.86]Meaning the moving and the shaking.
[07:33.08]No, no, no, no.
[07:34.42]I hate it.
[07:36.10]The plane is best.
[07:37.62]I love going au naturel.
[07:41.25]If that's what you say, what you declare, then you can turn the vibration on and off with the...
[07:58.88]All clear, good.
[08:00.64]We shall see you later.
[08:02.74]That's slower than I remember.
[08:05.10]Did the text come on screen that slowly before?
[08:07.38]This is remake.
[08:09.16]Alright, Katamari.
[08:12.44]If you don't know what Katamari is, it's a game where you roll around a little, never-lasting gobstopper, and you have to pick up shit.
[08:19.14]It sticks to the ball as a sticky ball.
[08:25.54]You use the analogs to turn around, back and forward, you have to roll over everything, pick up stuff, and you gotta make your kachabari huge.
[08:32.69]Or as big as the king desires.
[08:36.11]Vibration on?
[08:37.05]I'm not gonna put vibration on.
[08:38.61]I hate vibration.
[08:39.53]I'm with the king on this one.
[08:41.25]Vibration sucks.
[08:43.79]It's a feature that we somehow put on all consoles after its intended purpose was used and done.
[08:52.49]You guys were... Let's listen.
[08:55.33]Rumble was the VR from, like, 1993.
[08:58.56]Well, I'm in the game!
[09:02.76]My car just got hit!
[09:04.04]Whoa!
[09:04.70]My hands!
[09:05.26]It was revolutionary.
[09:06.09]It was insane.
[09:08.13]It's not necessary anymore.
[09:13.51]Dazzling.
[09:14.29]We feel a swoon coming.
[09:21.52]Vibration.
[09:23.38]Yeah, it was a peripheral you had to attach to the back of your controller.
[09:31.92]Phones have vibration too, Boomer.
[09:34.48]Yeah, but your phone vibrates to alert you of something.
[09:37.99]It doesn't vibrate so you're not like walking around and each step the phone vibrates to pretend like you're walking around somewhere.
[09:45.29]Like, oh dude, this is pretty, this is pretty... Ooh, I can feel, I'm walking.
[09:48.85]I actually am because I vibrate every single time I step.
[09:51.51]I know I'm walking.
[09:57.99]Did somebody just say turn off the music?
[10:02.32]Wait.
[10:05.38]That's like one of the best parts of the whole game.
[10:11.24]Please turn off the music.
[10:13.94]Look is L. You can look around.
[10:16.20]Yep.
[10:16.62]R is jump.
[10:17.32]Okay, quick turn.
[10:28.25]Is... Oh, it's both buttons.
[10:32.79]Okay.
[10:33.23]So you gotta go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
[10:59.29]If you've actually never played this game before, it really is like a wonderful experience.
[11:05.57]That's why we're doing it on stream.
[11:13.86]You wanna talk about like a DLC character for Smash?
[11:18.06]Don't put Sora in the fucking game.
[11:21.00]Everyone's like, oh, Sora for DLC!
[11:22.62]No, put the King of the Cosmos in the game.
[11:36.59]What a great character that would be.
[11:40.32]No, it was indeed not a dream.
[11:42.02]We really did it.
[11:42.62]The king of all cosmos has really done it.
[11:45.02]A sky full of stars.
[11:47.36]We broke it.
[11:51.52]Yes, we were naughty.
[11:52.80]Completely naughty.
[11:55.29]So, so, so very sorry.
[11:58.59]But just between you and us, it feels quite good.
[12:03.86]Not that we can remember very clearly, but we were in all nature's embrace.
[12:07.50]We felt the beauty of all things and felt love for all.
[12:11.91]That's how it was.
[12:14.39]Did you see?
[12:15.21]We smiled a genuine smile.
[12:16.65]Did you see it?
[12:17.49]The stars splintering in perfect view.
[12:20.97]So many.
[12:21.83]There used to be almost a nuisance, but there's nothing but darkness.
[12:26.97]He.
[12:27.71]Ehe.
[12:28.35]Tis but a dream.
[12:29.15]Ehe.
[12:30.19]But a beautiful one.
[12:32.34]be but beauty that miraculous fabulous moment has passed it's over we came to and found everyone furious even the king of all cosmos was not spared their wrath really everybody was irate so anyway peewee prince hurry up and bring back the glorious starry sky
[12:55.91]Our problem, your problem, yeah, you owe us, your existence.
[12:58.74]We collect on the debt, yes.
[13:01.08]Peewee German, don't you care.
[13:02.48]Hand in hand, always there, yes, the very definition of the father-son bond, yes.
[13:08.74]Alright then, let's get cracking.
[13:13.64]Sending things to Earth.
[13:23.42]Prince is already in Smash, what?
[13:27.05]Really?
[13:27.31]No, but not the king of the cosmos.
[13:31.69]Here we are, Earth.
[13:32.35]This is the game.
[13:33.01]Full of things as usual.
[13:36.59]So, so small.
[13:37.53]You're as small as ever.
[13:39.15]We didn't notice not one jot with what the stars at all.
[13:43.40]What is that?
[13:43.88]That body?
[13:44.64]That physique?
[13:45.24]Could you really be our son?
[13:48.44]Ehe, I've got it.
[13:50.32]Build yourself up while you roll the katamari, work out and get bigger.
[13:54.94]Yes indeed.
[13:55.38]Don't presume to take the escalator up to the throne just because you're the prince.
[14:00.76]Wow.
[14:01.78]Tangent.
[14:02.88]Wild tangent.
[14:04.02]We didn't go there last time, but it's alright.
[14:06.68]First time on Earth means no worrying about time.
[14:09.07]We think we'll come and pick you up when that Katamari is 10 centimeters.
[14:12.65]Just remember, many things that live here scurrying around and generally getting in the way.
[14:18.14]When one of these sneaks up behind you, an alert comes up on the lower left.
[14:22.50]I love this snake.
[14:24.20]Try not to bump into anything alive.
[14:27.18]But don't worry about it too much.
[14:29.02]It won't end the game or anything, so just relax and roll.
[14:32.34]Good luck, inchling prince.
[14:35.71]So, there we go, here we go.
[14:38.39]The best part.
[14:40.27]Ooh, that same thing.
[14:42.63]This was the very first thing we ever rolled up.
[14:47.10]This dice.
[14:49.44]Oh, we feel a little emotional.
[14:52.64]We should put this in the diary.
[14:57.56]Oh, I bumped into the snail.
[15:02.39]I'm gonna get the blocks of cheese.
[15:10.03]It went back to me, the memories!
[15:11.33]Look at the sandwiches, oh!
[15:16.09]You guys know the Reddit, the Febreddit, like, oddly satisfying?
[15:18.49]They actually got all their inspiration from this game.
[15:23.39]This whole game is just one giant, oddly satisfying Reddit thread.
[15:27.79]It's not just inherently satisfying.
[15:35.90]What about the cell phones?
[15:37.72]No, I'm not big enough for those yet.
[15:40.28]Not big enough for the cell phones.
[15:48.40]Why do the phone tags hurt like a jello?
[15:52.04]Ah, what?
[15:52.48]It's alive?
[15:54.58]The same thing.
[15:55.52]This was the very first thing we ever collided with.
[16:02.15]Why can I not pick up those little mounds of jelly?
[16:08.37]Alright, let's go this way.
[16:10.19]Let's make it roll fast.
[16:12.19]Almost there.
[16:15.47]10 centimeters and that's it.
[16:16.37]I'm gonna tour a little bit.
[16:22.01]Make it walk.
[16:23.33]Damn it.
[16:23.91]Not big enough.
[16:26.31]Eventually you can pick up the biggest stuff in the hole in the room on Earth.
[16:32.91]How goes it?
[16:34.17]How is Earth, huh?
[16:36.11]Oh, you made a 10cm Katamari, how fabulous!
[16:39.21]But we'd forgotten all about that, so you're mostly clearing everything else, we assume.
[16:43.32]Everyone on Earth is very nice, so they'll be very helpful.
[16:46.72]They'll let you roll everything up with a smile, yes, possibly also a wave.
[16:51.48]Anyway, let's go home for now.
[17:01.61]Oh yes, I almost forgot, completely slipped the mind.
[17:03.95]When rolling on earth, there are a few more things to be careful of.
[17:09.25]You cannot roll up objects larger than your katamari.
[17:11.75]Crashing into larger objects and walls will break things of the katamari and reduce its size.
[17:16.49]Things fall off.
[17:18.53]Oddly shaped objects will make your katamari lopsided and fuck it all up.
[17:24.13]What?
[17:26.01]No.
[17:30.31]Loud game.
[17:32.84]There, is that better?
[17:38.38]I'm not doing the... I know how to play the game!
[17:39.90]It was the first goal, but it's not the very exciting one, is it?
[17:44.47]Next time, we want a much bigger one.
[17:47.95]The thing that you collected the most of is... Snacks.
[17:52.01]Stationery and games.
[17:54.77]My Earth is really full of things.
[17:57.24]We will now release it into the sky.
[18:01.42]Yeah, you're essentially making stars for the cosmos.
[18:06.98]10 centimeters, 1 millimeter.
[18:11.42]Here's the menu!
[18:12.20]You forgot your own planet.
[18:14.40]Really?
[18:14.60]Are you serious?
[18:15.12]So you're just not just small, but a bit slow, too.
[18:19.89]I can already see the clips that are coming out from this.
[18:23.45]You know?
[18:25.05]Like, how many clips have been done in this stream so far?
[18:30.18]You guys have already clipped 13 things in the tutorial.
[18:36.86]We cannot feel but partly responsible.
[18:41.07]Sai, this is your home planet.
[18:42.77]The planet where you live.
[18:45.33]Here you can look at stars and save the game and do lots of other things.
[18:48.29]You can even visit Earth and the Space Mushroom just by pressing the L and R button.
[18:54.05]Roll your Katamari around on Earth.
[18:55.71]Visit the Space Mushroom to compete against your cousins.
[18:59.71]And that's about it.
[19:00.41]Your smallness to get a grip.
[19:02.43]Oh, there's another clip!
[19:03.91]Your absent-mindedness.
[19:05.05]There's another one!
[19:05.73]Alright, make sure to save.
[19:10.79]Make sure you remind me to do that.
[19:11.71]Alright, let's save the game right now.
[19:20.53]So you guys want the music up or the sound down?
[19:25.23]How does that sound?
[19:27.21]Is that more tolerable for your ears?
[19:29.77]Maybe?
[19:32.79]Uh, data.
[19:33.71]Collection.
[19:35.67]Control config.
[19:37.65]Presence.
[19:39.87]View constellations.
[19:40.87]Alright, let me go save it.
[19:45.17]Select a file.
[19:46.17]Uh, how about right in the middle?
[19:50.29]Louder.
[19:51.96]Not louder.
[19:52.56]No, don't quit the game.
[19:58.48]So, is there anything else I can do in here?
[19:59.90]I remember somebody was saying that the graphic settings are actually somehow in here, but I'm playing on the Switch, I don't think there are any graphic settings.
[20:09.19]Alright, let's go.
[20:14.71]So, let's take a look at the map.
[20:17.07]We've got this one.
[20:19.21]This is our first ever role, it's Castella.
[20:24.53]And I think now it's time to go to Earth.
[20:32.12]Here's your world mod.
[20:33.64]Make a star two, make a star one.
[20:36.68]Here's the second level.
[20:39.07]Make a star two.
[20:49.40]I love this.
[20:52.00]I wish I could play the piano.
[20:52.94]I would put it on like the weird dum-dum chorus thing and just play all day.
[21:01.35]Because this is just a keyboard with a setting on it.
[21:12.91]Alright, um... Have you ever been to the Philippines?
[21:17.87]We stopped in the day before yesterday.
[21:21.49]We hope you can visit during the day's rolling.
[21:24.51]Like, that's possible.
[21:26.41]Oh, yes.
[21:28.32]A royal present for the hardworking prince.
[21:31.68]That's what we were thinking.
[21:33.18]While playing catch with your present.
[21:35.92]And it went down to earth, it just fell to earth.
[21:39.56]Must be around somewhere, so roll it up while you're at it.
[21:44.84]Sending things to earth.
[21:49.25]Movies.
[21:51.07]Programs.
[21:52.55]Elephants.
[21:53.73]Giraffes.
[21:54.81]Sheep.
[21:56.17]Alligators.
[21:58.93]Here we are.
[22:00.03]Look at the little rats with the cheese ball.
[22:03.13]Here we go!
[22:28.14]Come on, I'm trying to do an interesting intro to the game Can't get these, oh I can I can get the toothpaste Gotta get the small shit first Taffy, get the candy I can't get the taffy yet Not for the love of god, really No orange slices?
[22:54.65]Not big enough
[22:58.48]I can get the little marbles.
[22:59.60]What about these?
[23:05.06]Fuck!
[23:05.48]Come on!
[23:06.04]Nail polish!
[23:06.68]No!
[23:08.26]Matchsticks!
[23:10.36]I have to get bigger!
[23:14.06]Get up!
[23:17.98]There we go, okay.
[23:19.56]Grown.
[23:20.92]Now it's time to roll over everything here.
[23:23.68]I'm going to take out the Legos.
[23:25.54]And the chocolate cookies.
[23:29.45]Can't get the big ones.
[23:32.47]Was it 20?
[23:32.75]20 centimeters?
[23:35.52]Okay, I can get the nail polish.
[23:43.26]I'm gonna go up.
[23:46.68]We did not go up at all.
[23:48.47]No, I fell off!
[23:49.59]Shit.
[23:50.47]This momentum.
[23:51.69]It's alright, I got six minutes.
[24:08.64]What's going on?
[24:11.01]Hmm, 10 centimeters.
[24:12.17]Just get it bigger.
[24:13.39]I know, I know I'm gonna do 20.
[24:17.87]What do you think I'm doing?
[24:18.81]I can get the candy.
[24:25.60]Oh, I can get- I can get the tapes!
[24:27.38]These things are huge.
[24:28.08]Get them.
[24:28.84]All of them.
[24:30.20]Every single birthday tape.
[24:31.52]Get it.
[24:31.88]Oh my god, I just ruined everything.
[24:34.38]I'm fine.
[24:34.90]Do I go up?
[24:35.89]I'm gonna go up here.
[24:37.67]Pick up the entire breakfast.
[24:39.41]House of Cards?
[24:54.17]No!
[24:54.57]I fell off!
[24:55.49]Shit!
[24:57.23]No, that was about to be so- Shadow Spying!
[24:58.85]Get me up there!
[25:02.77]Come on, man.
[25:06.41]I can go to sleep tonight.
[25:07.31]Okay, good.
[25:15.00]Reset.
[25:17.16]What am I bumping into?
[25:19.32]Frogs?
[25:24.04]Come on, I can still pick shit up up here.
[25:27.96]Oh, watch out, I'm not gonna help!
[25:31.89]I don't know why I think that's funny now.
[25:37.73]Anything in the bathroom?
[25:39.39]Oh, mousetraps.
[25:43.93]I'm getting hit by the mousetraps.
[25:53.34]Right here.
[25:54.02]Racer's got him.
[25:58.73]Alright, I'm good.
[26:07.17]Anything else over here that I didn't get?
[26:09.40]Can I get the whole dinner?
[26:11.06]Yeah, I can.
[26:13.60]18.4.
[26:13.62]We got it.
[26:14.16]It's fine.
[26:14.76]Everything's fine.
[26:21.08]I want to get up there.
[26:24.64]How do I jump with this?
[26:26.42]Can you jump with the actual Katamari ball?
[26:33.21]What is left that I didn't get?
[26:34.19]I can't go outside.
[26:35.33]Oh my god, I can go outside.
[26:41.17]Basket of apples.
[26:42.29]Got it.
[26:45.67]Just jump.
[26:46.89]Oh, what a nice Katamari.
[26:53.95]Substantially, it goes down smooth.
[26:56.53]But actually, we would love to have a much bigger, nicer Tatamari.
[27:00.33]We'll leave you to your work.
[27:01.43]Alright, I gotta just... I beat it just to get as many socks as I can.
[27:05.34]Get the knives.
[27:16.47]I know people are going to get really upset that I didn't get every sock, and there's going to be a lot of opportunity where you can scream at me.
[27:22.83]Pikachu sock.
[27:24.99]Yeah, that's what they were.
[27:35.58]Get the sock.
[27:37.62]Alright, because I have an opportunity to, I'll get it.
[27:39.40]It's back here, right?
[27:44.52]Right there.
[27:47.58]I got it.
[27:47.90]I got it.
[27:48.26]Everybody can relax.
[27:49.06]I got the sock.
[27:49.58]I hope we don't have to pick up the fence.
[27:59.16]I love the pogchamp for picking up the sock.
[28:04.55]Is that all it takes?
[28:07.59]I just have to pick up a sock?
[28:13.86]I'm not tall enough to get this.
[28:16.41]Eventually you can pick up... I'm tiny right now.
[28:18.30]You guys think this is the whole game right here?
[28:22.00]Just wait until I'm as big as the buildings.
[28:27.20]Oh, somebody clipped that one!
[28:30.83]Oh, I got the present.
[28:38.61]The clip list grows.
[28:46.06]Every time he says the word tall, small, or not big enough, make sure you get like five clips of it, and then string them all together.
[28:54.75]So it's like, small, not tall enough, I'm small.
[28:56.73]I'm too small, I'm short.
[28:57.85]I'm too short for this, I'm too small for this.
[28:59.95]God, not tall, short, inch.
[29:02.66]I just gave it to you.
[29:03.82]Don't even have to do the work.
[29:05.52]Nobody has to even do the work now.
[29:07.62]You just got it for free.
[29:15.37]You don't even have to do the cliff compilation.
[29:18.25]There we go, I can get the fence.
[29:21.99]What?
[29:23.45]I thought I was... I couldn't just get the fence right there?
[29:25.94]30 seconds.
[29:35.36]Come on, fast!
[29:36.74]Fast!
[29:41.02]Oh, I can't make it up here.
[29:42.73]Into the lady's face.
[29:46.82]Steal all of the shit that's on her desk.
[29:49.80]Oh, fuck.
[30:02.10]Time's up.
[30:03.47]It was boring to watch this all the time.
[30:12.01]Come on, man.
[30:13.43]This game's really fun.
[30:14.37]I love this game.
[30:15.45]Let me have this.
[30:21.82]The king of the cosmos is in chat.
[30:25.04]34 centimeters.
[30:26.32]It's pretty big.
[30:26.88]We imagine it'll look pretty stuck.
[30:31.18]If it were ours, we'd make it much bigger.
[30:35.62]Here!
[30:35.86]This is our royal present.
[30:36.98]What is it?
[30:38.60]Guess what?
[30:39.11]Guess what it is?
[30:41.73]The thing that you collected the most of is stationary.
[30:46.65]Earth is really full of things, isn't it?
[30:50.75]We will now release it into the sky.
[30:55.35]Oh, I forgot about these little... Wait, everybody quiet.
[31:06.48]They're watching German Rumble!
[31:25.86]There's a story here, guys.
[31:29.05]You didn't think it was an elaborate storyline?
[31:30.73]I want to see what the present is.
[31:36.29]Winter Scarf.
[31:38.23]Nice.
[31:43.67]I'm not even saving it.
[31:44.43]Let's just fucking go wild and not even save it.
[31:51.24]Yeah, now I have a scarf.
[31:57.14]What about the secret mushroom?
[32:02.44]Here's all the friends.
[32:03.62]Another cousin has arrived.
[32:04.74]Here they are.
[32:05.16]Alright, who do I want to... You can be... This is a character.
[32:07.78]Choose your character.
[32:08.42]Let's see.
[32:12.62]Who do I want to be?
[32:17.10]I fucked it up.
[32:18.08]I couldn't even get the strength to even say anything afterwards.
[32:20.48]I was trying to do... I was going to say, Olimar!
[32:23.74]But I missed.
[32:32.74]Who do I be?
[32:33.36]I kind of like the picnic table guy.
[32:38.75]Or long head.
[32:46.84]What about this guy?
[32:49.46]Or girl's Marcy.
[33:00.43]Alright, fine.
[33:01.09]I'll do Marcy.
[33:01.79]Come over here.
[33:02.85]Come here!
[33:03.21]Why can't I select you?
[33:06.18]What the hell?
[33:06.84]Select!
[33:07.28]Okay, got it.
[33:24.58]No, no, select.
[33:25.94]Can I not use?
[33:30.14]Usual control.
[33:30.90]Okay, what the hell?
[33:32.68]I can't play with Marzi?
[33:33.70]Yeah, I'm pressing A. A's not doing anything.
[33:38.52]Can I just... This is for multiplayer only.
[33:43.90]What?
[33:49.11]I can't play as those characters?
[33:56.44]Whatever.
[33:56.74]Everyone just get ready for the next meteor or star.
[34:01.65]Boatarde.
[34:03.31]Have you ever been to Portugal?
[34:05.45]We were there yesterday.
[34:07.07]We hope you can visit during the day's rolling.
[34:08.69]Like, that's possible.
[34:09.59]Oh yes, almost forgot.
[34:11.71]Oh yes.
[34:13.30]A royal present for the hardworking prince.
[34:14.78]There's a present on here.
[34:15.48]That's all I care about.
[34:16.16]I don't even care if I fucking lose.
[34:17.56]I don't care if I lose.
[34:18.46]Give me the present.
[34:19.48]That's what we were thinking, but we sort of tossed it down the road.
[34:22.98]We had an issue and just sort of pitched it away.
[34:28.53]Must be around somewhere.
[34:30.27]So roll it up while you're at it.
[34:34.19]Will you guys leave?
[34:36.77]No, no, no, leave.
[34:38.07]I was gonna say leave the king alone.
[34:42.38]Will you guys leave?
[34:52.13]I just wanna do this by myself.
[34:58.19]You'll be rolling around the town.
[35:00.11]The Katamari should be, let's see, 50!
[35:02.05]50 centimeters!
[35:04.92]We can believe you can do it in 9 minutes.
[35:10.66]Any longer than that and even the king of the cosmos can't wait for you.
[35:13.54]We look forward to a nice Katamari.
[35:15.52]Loser Prince.

[35:58.17]The appetizer with the mushroom?
[35:59.31]What are they called?
[36:00.75]What are they called?
[36:02.31]The stuffed mushroom?
[36:03.39]What is it called?
[36:04.45]A stuffed mushroom.

[37:02.14]I did the wrong route.
[37:04.28]No, it's okay.
[37:05.40]I got plenty of time.
[37:08.78]Get out of the way!
[37:14.77]All these.

[37:37.51]Oh shit, there's a cat behind me.
[37:39.45]When am I gonna get chocolate?
[37:40.49]What's wrong with me?
[37:52.81]Is this- no, this is tape.
[37:56.68]Am I big enough to get these?
[37:57.94]The cylinders?
[37:58.52]Yup.
[37:58.84]Okay, chocolate.
[38:00.36]And we need to find a present too.
[38:06.19]Get up there, I know you can.
[38:07.55]Really.
[38:10.09]Ugh.
[38:10.17]Alright.
[38:13.61]We have, uh, an Edible Arrangements.
[38:15.37]Now I'm lopsided.

[39:03.74]There it is.
[39:10.69]I can't get the clock.
[39:17.79]Watch out for the dung beetle.
[39:19.39]It's stuck.
[39:20.20]I cannot get the clock, guys.
[39:26.52]You're doing your own Katamari with shit.
[39:28.54]Get out of the way.
[39:31.43]I got it!
[39:31.73]I got the clock.
[39:32.72]Everybody can relax.
[39:33.98]No, I didn't.
[39:37.52]I can't get the clock.
[39:39.96]Sorry.
[39:45.47]You can get it.
[39:46.45]Well, let me just make sure... Let me come back when I'm a little... able to get... when I'm able to pick that up.
[39:51.88]Like, now, okay?
[39:55.47]Who's stealing the muffins?
[39:56.59]Ooh, too late.
[39:57.43]What are you doing?
[40:02.24]If anything skimpers, roll it up.
[40:07.40]Alright, I'm now bigger.
[40:19.71]I can't get the clock, everybody.
[40:22.51]It's not gonna happen.
[40:24.55]It's glitched out underneath.
[40:26.03]It's not gonna happen.
[40:30.79]I only have four minutes.
[40:33.59]I gotta stop listening to you guys about clocks.
[40:35.85]I have to go up here.
[40:40.08]Where have we not gone?
[40:40.62]Alright, fish.
[40:48.12]Here we go.
[40:48.56]This'll make me 50.
[40:50.87]Not big enough.
[40:51.45]Fuck.
[40:56.82]Oh no, this is not good.
[40:58.80]This is not good.
[41:05.84]Not good.
[41:06.74]I gotta get these trees.
[41:09.38]I can't even pick these up.
[41:10.13]I'm not big enough.
[41:14.51]Soda?
[41:15.39]Okay.
[41:19.30]And if you don't know the name of this song, do yourself a huge favor and just type in Katamari Damacy OST and listen to the whole damn thing.
[41:30.80]Ooh!
[41:32.42]Found the water jugs.
[41:35.99]Three minutes, I can do it.
[41:43.32]Just get on top.
[41:48.78]Come on!
[41:49.98]Look at all those utensils over here.
[41:55.29]No!
[41:57.05]Don't get stuck back here.
[41:58.13]48.
[42:01.57]I got it.
[42:05.83]We want clock.
[42:10.29]You guys don't really want the clock.
[42:14.41]Plus, I don't even remember where the hell it even is.
[42:17.73]Where's the clock?
[42:20.80]Clock, clock, clock.
[42:23.92]What a nice Katamari.
[42:25.34]Kind of bratty, kind of shy.
[42:28.46]See?
[42:28.72]Flower clock!
[42:29.28]I already got it.
[42:29.78]Now that you've come this far, we would love to have a much bigger and nicer one.
[42:34.64]Let's go.
[42:35.06]Alright, let's see if I can figure out where that clock was.
[42:40.87]I've got two minutes to figure it out.
[42:47.71]Clock or no stream?
[42:50.29]Wasn't it up here to the right, right?
[42:58.05]It's over here.
[42:59.25]Okay.
[42:59.69]Clock.
[43:00.48]Line it up.
[43:03.56]Oh, okay.
[43:05.44]Everybody can calm down.
[43:09.72]See?
[43:09.82]Now you can all hang out.
[43:11.08]Everything's fine.
[43:12.02]I got the clock.
[43:18.27]Oh boy!
[43:19.71]That was an ooh.
[43:33.66]That was an ooh right there.
[43:38.48]You have one minute left.
[43:39.48]I can't go through there.
[43:41.76]I'm too jacked.
[43:48.15]Now if we get the broom?
[43:48.87]No.
[43:50.01]Get the dust fans.
[43:54.25]This is the best part.
[43:54.99]When you get big enough and you can just crush and roll over everything.
[44:01.02]And I get to 70.
[44:02.90]Can I jump that?
[44:05.30]Come on, jump it.
[44:12.41]Fire extinguishers.
[44:18.06]Time for a fireworks display.
[44:20.99]What?
[44:21.11]What is he talking about?
[44:26.91]Get all the birds.
[44:27.45]I have ten seconds to get the birds.
[44:29.17]And the cow.
[44:31.41]I got the cow.
[44:32.01]Or dog, whatever it was.
[44:38.71]Sending one.
[44:40.63]He comes and gets to the bunker.
[44:54.15]I didn't get the present.
[44:56.55]Oh well.
[44:58.39]Royal Rainbow, take us back.
[45:07.78]24 killstreak!
[45:13.02]It's pretty big, we imagine it'll link up pretty good stuff.
[45:18.96]What even is this game?
[45:20.06]I'm so glad that you don't know what this is.
[45:22.72]It makes me very happy that you don't know, because this is an old game from PlayStation 2 that they just recently redid, kind of reimagined and remastered.
[45:31.20]I know it's a remake and remastered, but still.
[45:34.16]It's on the Switch.
[45:35.02]It's on Steam.
[45:35.86]Is it on Steam?
[45:36.38]Am I lying?
[45:36.84]Is that a fucking incorrect statement?
[45:43.85]It is.
[45:44.15]Okay.
[45:45.49]Yeah.
[45:45.81]How much is this game?
[45:48.33]This game's like 20, 30 bucks, right?
[45:53.33]I picked up a lot of cooking items.
[45:55.35]30 bucks?
[45:56.65]30 bucks.
[45:58.99]That's not bad for a game like this.
[46:01.19]There's a lot of content in this game.
[46:07.48]A $30 jogger?
[46:08.72]Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.
[46:10.52]Ho, ho, ho.
[46:12.62]Sonna koto ga aru mono desuka?
[46:15.30]Sa, takushi ga kimashita yo.
[46:23.09]Somebody said this was made in Unity?
[46:31.35]Am I getting baited here?
[46:35.59]I might be.
[46:36.37]That sounds like it could be real.
[46:53.61]It was ported to Unity.
[46:54.71]Okay, so it was ported to Unity.
[46:56.77]But Unity is one of those... It's one of those things that... Oh, hey, wow, interesting.
[47:00.97]This was made in Unity.
[47:01.97]And it's a Red Dead Redemption 2.
[47:03.37]Isn't that what people do?
[47:05.76]People do that, right?
[47:08.10]Oh, my mic is fucked up.
[47:09.26]Wow, I got it.
[47:13.22]What?
[47:13.58]What?
[47:13.84]I can't hear you.
[47:14.56]What?
[47:14.94]I didn't get any presents that round, so... Unfortunately...
[47:25.30]Make a star 3.
[47:26.08]So we have some options here.
[47:27.02]We're gonna do make a cancer or make a star 4.
[47:35.83]Anything else?
[47:39.91]Peek the mic or riot?
[47:44.04]Why would I do that?
[47:48.93]Yeah.
[47:50.87]So, uh, 1, 2, this is 3, so let's just stay at, no, 1, make a star, 2, make a star, 3.
[47:56.02]So, 4, 5.
[48:01.48]Peek mic, alright.
[48:02.58]I'm not gonna peek my mic!
[48:06.85]What?
[48:07.99]Why do you want me to do that?
[48:09.13]This... Do it!
[48:09.93]Peek the mic.
[48:14.54]What the fuck is wrong with you guys?
[48:16.46]What?
[48:23.44]The game is super loud compared to me.
[48:26.52]There, that's better.
[48:27.24]Buenas dias.
[48:31.89]Have you ever been to Spain?
[48:33.21]It's our other homeland.
[48:38.73]Peek it.
[48:42.20]Hold on, this is the only time you're gonna get me to do this.
[48:47.32]Hold on, hold on.
[49:14.49]Is it?
[49:36.14]I can't do it.
[49:37.02]I can't.
[49:37.32]I'm trying to capture it on my webcam.
[49:39.10]I thought I was gonna break the webcam microphone.
[49:41.82]But I can't do that right now.
[49:42.74]Because I can't.
[49:43.56]I have my mic on the switch.
[49:44.51]I have to go into my audio device settings.
[49:48.87]It doesn't... It's not like... Hold on.
[49:50.03]Tell me if this changes anything.
[49:53.59]What is this doing?
[49:54.25]What is this doing?
[49:55.09]Is this the same?
[49:55.73]Is this the same?
[49:56.34]Yeah, it is.
[49:59.08]Do it!
[49:59.52]Ugh.
[50:00.02]God damn it.
[50:01.10]Just... Hold on.
[50:05.39]Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun
[50:36.03]No, it's not gonna happen.
[50:37.13]It's not gonna happen.
[50:37.67]Everybody... No.
[50:39.25]That's not gonna happen because I can't... I have to, like, restart my computer for it to recognize the microphone here.
[50:44.22]No, everybody relax.
[50:45.58]I'm not gonna peek my microphone.
[50:50.58]It's not recognizing the other audio device, which is the webcam mic.
[50:53.10]I'm not gonna peek this one.
[50:53.96]I'm not gonna break my fucking $6,700 mic.
[50:55.32]Okay?
[50:55.46]It's not gonna happen.
[51:07.16]Alright, let's go back to what we were doing.
[51:17.23]Wallet, keys, rings, hopes and dreams are lost at all.
[51:23.12]Roll it up while you're at it.
[51:25.58]Break... break your stuff.
[51:29.45]I can't believe I just wasted like six straight minutes trying to find a way to break the microphone that I have over here.
[51:38.22]Now, all right, if you stick around for the whole stream, I will break this mic over here.
[51:47.37]I will peak this mic until it doesn't work.
[51:49.15]Not this one, the webcam one.
[51:50.51]No, no, do not do that!
[51:52.13]Okay, staccatum aureus should be one, around one meter.
[51:57.51]We can believe in you, it's 10 minutes, one meter.
[52:00.91]But any longer than that and the king of all cosmos.
[52:03.65]I can't.
[52:04.63]We look forward to a nice Katamari bite-sized prince.
[52:11.84]Let's go.
[52:16.22]This is another great song too.
[52:18.10]This whole soundtrack.
[52:19.72]What do the kids say?
[52:21.59]What do the kids say now, right?
[52:24.37]Light it up, right?
[52:25.09]This contract is light it up.
[52:27.92]It's that good.
[52:28.95]It causes a fire, right?
[52:33.89]Man, this soundtrack is so good.
[52:35.39]It's causing a fire in here!
[52:38.85]Who lit that fire?
[52:40.09]Right?
[52:50.58]No, this is not satisfying to me.
[52:52.44]I need this to be satisfying to me.
[52:57.00]Okay, that was satisfying.
[53:01.49]I can't leave here until I get all the erasers.
[53:03.27]I don't think I'm gonna be able to get it, though.
[53:09.49]I have to go across.
[53:12.75]Oh, no!
[53:15.22]There's too much momentum.
[53:16.12]I had to do it.
[53:19.20]Get out of the way, mouse.
[53:28.04]There's a bear with a sweater on.
[53:32.39]Sing it with me now!
[53:40.35]Not big enough.
[53:41.73]Not big enough.
[53:48.88]I'm up here.
[53:51.98]Get the cones.
[53:53.64]Not big enough.
[54:01.08]Roll it.
[54:03.43]I know you can do it.
[54:04.77]I know you can.
[54:05.47]I've seen you do it before.
[54:06.37]Come on.
[54:06.73]You're wasting time.
[54:09.51]You're wasting time!
[54:11.51]Up down, up down, up down, up down.
[54:13.39]Why are you wasting time?
[54:14.41]Come here.
[54:14.97]There we go.
[54:15.53]Get all your aces.
[54:18.98]Your catamaran is as big as 24 lipsticks.
[54:21.90]Get it bigger already.
[54:23.18]Just get it bigger.
[54:25.16]Forehead.
[54:42.04]Is that all the erasers?
[54:43.02]I think that's all the erasers.
[54:46.68]Can you see?
[54:48.46]No, just a bit more.
[54:51.10]Fuck.
[54:52.16]Oh, okay.
[54:53.92]One more eraser.
[54:54.60]Sing it with me now.
[54:58.21]I'm not even singing it.
[55:01.11]Why do I keep saying sing it with me now?
[55:03.39]Oh, sing it with me now!
[55:16.07]Okay, can I break through the window?
[55:17.49]No.
[55:20.23]I'll be eventually big enough to go through here.
[55:23.91]What am I missing?
[55:24.69]What I didn't get?
[55:27.37]Mmm, something that uses a cardboard.
[55:29.15]Get the whole line of rats.
[55:32.56]What am I missing here?
[55:39.62]The pencils?
[55:41.32]Orange peels?
[55:43.70]There we go.
[55:46.31]Nice roll-up.
[55:48.16]So aristocratic.
[55:49.94]We are dazzled.
[55:50.60]Anything that scampers, let's just roll it up.
[55:57.72]Before it runs off.
[55:59.24]Why do you want me to roll up the animals?
[56:03.22]Right through, straight through, here we go.
[56:05.78]Ah, get them all.
[56:06.54]Get all the cigarette packs.
[56:09.93]Don't smoke, but just pick them up if they're on the ground Don't pick, don't pick cigarettes up if they're on the ground Throw them in the trash when you do that 20 centimeters, huh?
[56:29.65]Long, long way to go
[56:32.73]but it really does exponentially.
[56:35.31]Light bulb?
[56:35.75]Is this a sentient light bulb?
[56:37.19]What?
[56:39.03]If you can't make the Kazumari bigger, you can't get to the next stage.
[56:48.82]I'm working on it.
[56:49.70]It's not my fault this house is so fucked up.
[56:59.31]Little birds.
[57:06.71]I'll be back for those bears.
[57:13.18]Watermelon.
[57:15.74]That's not gonna make me grow?
[57:30.05]Just a baby.
[57:30.85]Just a very strong baby.
[57:34.35]Putting the square peg into the circle hole.
[57:39.35]And he does it.
[57:39.85]That's a strong baby.
[57:41.02]He shoved it.
[57:41.82]That was... Santa hat.
[57:50.94]The envelopes.
[57:51.78]At least I'm big enough to get these.
[57:53.18]This whole area I think I can get.
[57:56.02]No, I can't get this shelf.
[58:07.04]running the things I'm not supposed to be.
[58:08.40]There we go.
[58:11.40]Get the whole fridge worth of stuff.
[58:17.10]Here we go.
[58:17.56]This is where... Now we exponentially get large.
[58:20.02]All the tuna cans.
[58:22.49]Mustard.
[58:23.35]Ketchup.
[58:23.89]Relish.
[58:25.37]Bananas.
[58:26.15]Toast.
[58:26.69]Cheeseburger.
[58:28.35]Not big enough.
[58:30.99]Can I get it?
[58:32.67]I just want the milk.
[58:39.94]Alright.
[58:41.09]It's back to come out here.
[58:42.53]Let's see.
[58:47.19]Steal all their toys.
[58:50.06]Why can I not get those?
[58:53.62]Santa hat!
[58:54.42]Santa, where?
[58:57.95]Did I miss the Santa hat?
[59:04.01]Here's the worst part about this game being somebody that's watching and you play this.
[59:07.67]There are items that I just miss and you're like, oh, yeah, that, oh.
[59:18.66]Bathtub.
[59:25.97]Oh, no.
[59:27.33]No, no, no.
[59:27.90]Get me out of here.
[59:29.54]So I'm losing a centimeter a second.
[59:32.06]Get me out of the corner!
[59:33.88]Out of the corner!
[59:34.60]Jump!
[59:38.78]Oh, shit!
[59:41.76]No, that was a pizza pizza, I think.
[59:43.60]I want to keep that.
[59:44.34]No, that's my dog bone!
[59:49.64]Oh!
[59:50.40]Oh, thank God.
[59:51.26]I need to be a meter.
[60:00.13]Under the sink?
[60:01.16]I can.
[60:02.02]I can get all of both of them, just be careful.
[60:03.78]I'll get wedged in under the sink.
[60:07.88]Don't hit the gas line.
[60:14.19]I'm not gonna do it.
[60:15.23]I'm not gonna make it.
[60:17.87]I'm not gonna make it!
[60:21.12]I'm not gonna make it, am I?
[60:31.71]Come on, get to- There we go.
[60:32.85]Hold on.
[60:33.55]It's possible now.
[60:36.77]Only 50.
[60:37.37]Still, I got halfway to go.
[60:40.04]Exponential.
[60:40.70]Come on.
[60:40.96]This is where you exponentially grow.
[60:50.36]Do it.
[60:50.97]Come on.
[60:51.63]Get in here.
[60:56.45]No, no, no.
[60:56.65]The bathtub.
[60:56.89]The bathtub ruined the whole thing.
[61:04.21]60.
[61:10.11]Almost 60.
[61:11.41]Come on.
[61:12.51]Grow another one.
[61:18.37]67.
[61:19.21]Oh, I gotta get to 100.
[61:23.97]When's the next big growth period here?
[61:26.37]When do I get my new growth spurt?
[61:30.29]Edit TV?
[61:35.88]75.
[61:36.39]One minute left.
[61:42.75]Back outside.
[61:45.03]50 seconds.
[61:48.36]Go!
[61:55.74]Get everything.
[61:56.44]Just dash everywhere.
[61:57.42]Pick up the cat.
[61:58.02]Pick up the shopping cart.
[62:00.63]I can't.
[62:01.37]Fuck the cat.
[62:02.45]Fuck that cat.
[62:09.64]Come on!
[62:10.26]I got it!
[62:17.36]What a nice kataban.
[62:20.02]Tough, yet with a soft feel.
[62:21.08]Now that you've come this far, we'd like to have it a little bit bigger.
[62:24.69]Okay, let's see how I can get it bigger than this.
[62:28.71]What if I was stuck in a corner again?
[62:37.74]I don't even know where I am.
[62:40.74]I can't go back in the house.
[62:41.78]Oh, I'm in the house!
[62:50.24]Oh!
[62:51.26]I made it to the house.
[62:52.26]Damn it.
[62:55.69]Tactical nuke.
[62:58.25]I can't believe it.
[62:59.03]I got in the house and I would have just sucked up everything.
[63:09.04]It was the first goal, but it's not very exciting.
[63:12.50]We want a bigger one next time.
[63:16.19]The thing you collected the most is playtime.
[63:19.41]I don't know what that even means.
[63:20.67]Playtime?
[63:22.61]Earth really is full of fun.
[63:26.79]Time to release it into the sky.
[63:28.19]What's this one called?
[63:34.06]Toys is the name of this star.
[63:41.66]To be, why does it say to be continued every time?
[63:44.80]To be continued.
[64:23.60]Save the game?
[64:24.41]No, don't think so.
[64:27.07]That's not even funny.
[64:28.05]Like, it's not funny.
[64:29.25]Because if for some reason, if the game crashes, if the console crashes or something, that's not even funny.
[64:37.22]Oh, it's funny, we have to restart the whole game.
[64:39.00]Isn't that funny?
[64:39.56]Like, no, that's not funny.
[64:41.38]That would be a waste of time.
[64:49.72]Santa?
[64:50.06]Wait, Santa hat?
[64:51.62]Oh, I didn't get any presents.
[64:58.61]Oh, this is annoying.
[65:00.17]I had only one present.
[65:01.63]Alright, back to Earth.
[65:12.80]Santa hat.
[65:15.27]Alright, we've opened up more things.
[65:16.61]Here is... Starfire.
[65:22.29]We have to make constellations here.
[65:23.89]Okay, let's go.
[65:30.51]What is it?
[65:31.27]Something's not quite there.
[65:33.07]Oh yes, we get it.
[65:34.57]It just doesn't look delicious.
[65:35.77]The sky does not seem yummy at all.
[65:39.03]Everyone is still hungry, yes?
[65:40.23]Can't you see that, silly?
[65:42.15]Speaking of delicious, we must say, most certainly, we say crab.
[65:46.08]Most certainly crab.
[65:51.34]What a delightfully weird fucking dude.
[65:57.89]Delicious what?
[65:59.63]I can't even read that.
[66:04.05]What the fuck?
[66:06.73]I didn't even do it.
[66:09.80]Looks yummy.
[66:11.82]But no, no, not yet.
[66:12.76]Patience is a virtue.
[66:13.70]Focus, we must focus.
[66:16.61]To make the yummiest... Okay, we need crabs.
[66:20.99]All you have to do is roll up as many crabs as you can find.
[66:25.17]Let's see.
[66:26.68]You have seven minutes to roll up as many crabs as possible.
[66:29.88]We look forward to a mouth-watering catamari, Callow Prince.
[66:34.80]Go!
[66:36.50]Oh, I hate them!
[66:41.58]Why is a crab on the spider web?
[66:44.51]Why is a crab hanging from a spider web?
[66:47.81]What the fuck?
[66:49.61]It doesn't make any sense.
[66:54.79]I wish it was like that.
[66:55.97]I would love if spiders weren't spiders.
[66:58.43]They were just crabs.
[66:59.87]I would love them.
[67:00.95]They would be so fun.
[67:07.08]Crabs are spiders with armor.
[67:08.58]No, crabs are fun and funny, and spiders are evil.
[67:18.03]I know this because... They're holding the toothbrushes, that's so... I love this.
[67:22.73]You know how I know this?
[67:23.49]Because every television show and movie I've ever seen in my whole life... Spider was evil, and goes like... And every crab is a funny character that likes money.
[67:37.21]Or the dances and shit.
[67:46.15]That's all I've ever been told.
[67:47.25]So of course I'm gonna be scared of spiders.
[67:49.78]And not crabs.
[67:53.84]Because of that stupid monster noise that I just made.
[68:03.30]Me money, me money, Spongebob!
[68:04.85]Like, that's not like... Why would I be scared of that?
[68:36.28]But I think there's only ever been one spider in the history of media that wasn't evil and had foam coming out of their mouth.
[68:45.02]I think it was Charlotte's Web.
[68:48.32]That's the only one.
[69:01.56]Crabs foam at the mouth?
[69:05.00]Oh, they don't.
[69:07.71]Spider-Man, but that Spider-Man is a man that was bit by a spider.
[69:13.03]That's not the same thing.
[69:15.87]And the spider that bit him was terrifying, because for some reason he got superpowers by being bit by a Black Widow radioactive fucking spider.
[69:24.09]That's scary.
[69:26.69]Oh yeah, but be careful, there's, uh, be careful, uh, the, the, the Black Widow that'll bite you with radioactive poison in its fangs.
[69:33.01]Oh, but, like, it's Spider-Man, though.
[69:38.03]The spider that bit Spider-Man, it was too small for you to hear it.
[69:41.91]But right before it bit him, it definitely went like... It just didn't pick up on the microphone.
[69:53.26]Man, I need more crab.
[69:55.16]I can't get the funny crab with shoes on.
[69:56.96]The shrimp looks good, too.
[70:08.76]I hate this ramp.
[70:15.39]I have to get the super crab.
[70:23.84]Crabs literally foam at the mouth to breathe.
[70:27.68]Yeah, but I see that as like flavored foam at the mouth, like Starburst.
[70:32.68]Not like evil venom foam.
[70:43.29]Am I not big enough to get you?
[70:44.21]Flavor!
[70:57.05]You know what I mean!
[71:04.95]Laughing at his own joke?
[71:06.15]No, I'm laughing at the interpretation of the thing that I said.
[71:11.45]Which on second revelation sounds pretty fucking dumb.
[71:22.86]Get the crabs?
[71:23.54]There's no more!
[71:24.24]I ran out.
[71:27.60]The only crabs are over here and I'm too big to get in there.
[71:38.71]There's some up.
[71:39.87]How do I go up?
[71:44.24]Can I climb?
[71:51.17]Jump?
[71:51.47]I can't, I don't have a jump.
[71:56.35]There's nowhere else I can go.
[71:58.20]Can I get up there?
[71:59.76]No, I can't.
[72:00.26]I can, like, go like this, but that doesn't do anything.
[72:01.84]There's an elevator?
[72:08.56]Where's there an elevator?
[72:19.48]That's not an elevator.
[72:20.56]This is not an elevator.
[72:22.70]Those are two chess pieces.
[72:24.56]Oh, come on, really?
[72:25.53]Alright, I got 90.
[72:35.39]Can I make it up?
[72:41.37]I need 100, come on.
[72:42.43]There's one right there.
[72:48.77]Got him.
[72:50.05]97.
[72:50.59]Come on.
[72:53.07]98, 99.
[72:55.87]How did I not get the one in the corner?
[72:57.22]I need 100.
[73:00.94]I need 100 or I'm gonna turn off the stream.
[73:11.74]What?
[73:14.04]What the fuck?
[73:33.91]If your Starburst is reminding you you're foaming at the mouth, then no.
[73:38.23]By the way, I'm just fucking pissed about Starbursts, can I tell you?
[73:42.17]I bought, and I realized why, there was a box of Starbursts, like a big box, that was on sale.
[73:50.65]I was like, holy shit, I like Starbursts, Starbursts are awesome.
[73:55.13]I bought the box, the thing was on sale, and Starbursts don't have a fucking expiration date on them.
[74:03.76]Can starbursts even expire?
[74:05.14]They made out of plastic rubber and they take a droplet and drop a little bit of flavoring juice on them.
[74:18.36]You just chew out the flavoring and then you spit it out.
[74:20.38]You're not supposed to swallow starbursts, guys.
[74:21.86]It stays in your stomach for like eight years.
[74:28.89]You chew it up until it's like a pale transparent color and then you just spit it out.
[74:36.55]You don't want to be ingesting that.
[74:38.45]Have you seen the ingredient list?
[74:59.07]Oh shit, I've been eating them wrong.
[75:03.65]That actually does look kind of delicious.
[75:05.01]No it doesn't, yes it does.
[75:09.56]Yeah, every Starburst you've ever eaten.
[75:11.16]Hold on, I'll tell you in a minute.
[75:31.60]The T-pose.
[75:37.52]I love how that's the one thing you got out of that entire sequence.
[75:41.16]And how delightfully odd that whole thing was.
[75:44.14]The T-pose is the thing.
[75:45.34]Whoa, I can't believe there was a T-pose there.
[76:05.65]But just be careful when you eat Starbursts, guys, because they stay in your stomach for 10 years.
[76:09.22]So if you eat, let's say you have, like, 200 Starbursts over the course of, like, four years or something.
[76:14.74]Eventually, you're gonna, you know, 10 years from now, you'll be, like, in your late 50s.
[76:22.17]And you're just gonna shit out a gigantic, flavored-sized, like, basketball.
[76:33.53]Okay, I'm crabbed.
[76:37.51]Loud.
[76:39.13]What do we got?
[76:47.74]We unlocked a Star... Let's do Starfire.
[76:53.82]Yeah, you're gonna shoot out a giant rubber-flavored basketball.
[77:03.59]What are you gonna do with that?
[77:12.26]Ever been to the Netherlands?
[77:13.38]We stopped in the day before yesterday.
[77:15.67]We hope you can visit during the days rolling like that's possible.
[77:19.35]Oh yes, why does it keep saying like that's possible?
[77:29.72]There's another present down here.
[77:30.74]I want to get another present.
[77:32.11]I'm gonna work my ass off for this present.
[77:43.01]Hey Jerma, I just made the math.
[77:44.85]I have 150 hours of old streams to watch, so can you please stop streaming for 150 days?
[77:48.53]I don't think I could do that.
[77:52.77]Sorry, you're gonna be forever catching up.
[78:02.70]Okay, today, you'll be rolling around the town.
[78:06.40]The Katamari should be, let's see, around 15, 1.5 meters.
[78:10.42]There's a point there.
[78:13.96]13 minutes for 1.5.
[78:16.06]Any longer, and I'll be very angry.
[78:18.24]There's a gift here, too.
[78:19.26]Tell me, okay, if you see the gift, tell me the location of it.
[78:22.22]Because my eyes aren't so good anymore.
[78:26.10]You know?
[78:32.70]I'm gonna take this one slow.
[78:35.92]Because I want to be sure I don't crash into everything, pick up all the eggs.
[78:41.28]Quail chick.
[78:44.60]Not big enough for that.
[78:47.20]Haha, it's there.
[78:51.77]I'll know when I look over chat and see 500 million people all writing the same thing.
[78:56.33]With, like, failed fish.
[78:58.11]Because I would have passed it three or four times by then.
[79:02.93]Use your eyes, Failfish.
[79:04.74]Use your eyes.
[79:05.56]Is he this bad on purpose?
[79:07.44]Once I start seeing that is when I know that I'm close.
[79:12.40]Look at the magnets.
[79:27.93]Not pretending.
[79:37.53]I'm not big enough for the milk.
[79:38.77]I need to drink more of that to get bigger.
[79:40.27]Well, I don't, but whatever, just clip it and fucking use it in your video, whatever the hell you're making.
[79:55.78]Get it!
[80:03.05]I need to get to 15, then I think I can grow a little more.
[80:07.79]Super glue?
[80:08.49]No, it's not 15.
[80:13.45]What is it?
[80:16.86]I'm getting all the little teeny tiny stuff first.
[80:19.02]It's always the hardest part.
[80:24.50]Any trees?
[80:28.54]It's parsley.
[80:35.40]Reminds me of Jet Set Radio.
[80:37.16]Good song.
[80:39.93]Both with good soundtrack.
[80:44.27]This soundtrack is so good.
[80:46.69]I remember having this on a CD.
[80:49.49]That I would play in my car.
[80:56.42]Ooh, look at this.
[80:57.44]Perfect.
[81:02.75]And I remember specifically stopping at red lights with the windows down and blasting the title theme.
[81:12.05]With all the windows down.
[81:13.20]I remember there was one time when I... Okay, so listen.
[81:30.53]Hear me out on this.
[81:36.17]This is like really embarrassing, but whatever, who cares.
[81:39.56]It's not even though, but it is.
[81:41.82]So one time I was driving some co-workers at the time home, and I had a CD that was a lot of video game music on the CD.
[81:53.09]And you know when you turn your car off when you're listening to music, and you're blasting something just like, oh yeah, this is like my alone me time music.
[82:04.12]Well, that's what it was.
[82:04.66]It was like a bunch of video game shit on it.
[82:08.63]And my coworkers at the time were not... They weren't into video games, they didn't really... This is also probably like... This is like 15 years ago.
[82:19.23]So anyways, I'm driving them home.
[82:22.47]And as we get in the car, and I turn the car on and we start... Oh, there's music in here!
[82:27.66]Oh, wait a minute!
[82:29.08]And the battle sequence theme from Lost Odyssey.
[82:33.63]It's playing.
[82:35.09]Loud.
[82:40.91]And it was just like... What is this?
[82:46.24]And I had to cover my tracks, you know what I mean?
[82:49.14]Because it's like a symphony orchestra is what's playing.
[82:51.42]And I remember just going, I love classical music.
[82:56.67]I'm like, I listen to classical music sometimes when I drive.
[82:59.85]That looks good.
[83:02.54]I bet he was beat red.
[83:05.16]He probably was.
[83:06.02]That's even worse!
[83:08.84]I have to- I had to cover my tracks.
[83:15.13]Ah yes, Mozart, yeah.
[83:17.07]So I had to look like the guy driving around listening to fucking Mozart.
[83:24.44]And honestly, let me tell you something about classical music, and a lot of people are probably going to disagree with me here, but the only time I ever hear classical music, ever, is when you're at the dentist getting surgery.
[83:38.03]So I don't want to be the guy listening to classical music.
[83:49.86]Like, when you're getting your teeth pulled, the guy's listening to classical music.
[83:56.28]I don't want to listen to that.
[83:57.12]And there's nothing wrong with classical music, it's really, you know, very expertly crafted.
[84:06.02]It's amazing pieces and they work so well and there's so much wonderful, wonderful music that has come out of full orchestras and classical instruments.
[84:22.39]But I don't, I'm not listening to it in my car.
[84:26.00]Like, hanging out with friends.
[84:27.57]Like, oh, what do you got, man?
[84:28.77]What's on your, uh... What's on your playlist?
[84:31.69]Oh, well, you know, I've got, you know, M&M, I guess, I think.
[84:34.83]Uh, and then, like... It'd be like, dude, what the fuck is this?
[84:42.78]It's like...
[84:59.11]Where's the present?
[84:59.87]No one has seen it yet.
[85:02.01]But I love listening to classical music.
[85:03.57]I do.
[85:15.46]But for some reason, I don't know why this is, but classical music really is just... You don't want people to know that you're listening to it.
[85:21.78]I don't know why.
[85:22.42]If everyone can agree that classical music is so wonderful, well, we're not allowed to play it in our cars?
[85:29.91]What is this?
[85:39.65]What is this?
[85:44.76]I love in the middle of that, is he this bad on purpose?
[85:47.19]So there's a way through here, I just gotta, okay.
[85:58.20]No, I love, I love classical music, but I also don't listen to, like, really any music.
[86:03.97]You guys all know that.
[86:15.38]You're wondering why.
[86:16.12]Everyone's like, what are you talking about?
[86:17.12]Question mark.
[86:18.46]Because I'm a fucking idiot.
[86:19.78]Like, I'm an imbecile.
[86:21.52]And for some reason, when I have music on, it's the only thing I can do.
[86:25.81]I can't put music on in the background.
[86:27.73]I can't have a conversation while music's playing.
[86:30.63]It's just like, I can hear it.
[86:31.59]I just think, though, okay?
[86:33.05]I hear the lyrics and talking and the beat.
[86:35.69]I'm talking too, but I can't because I have to hear it.
[86:44.50]But what are you doing now?
[86:47.66]Yeah, but this is different because this has to be on here because this is the whole- This is like 70... This is .70- No, this is like 50% of the reason why you play the game.
[86:57.84]No, that's like 30% because this- You know what I'm saying?
[87:00.54]This is a fucking amazing soundtrack.
[87:03.72]Okay, case in point.
[87:05.12]I couldn't just talk to you there.
[87:07.29]Because I heard like the construction music in the background.
[87:23.76]Is it up here somewhere?
[87:31.14]I did actually go past it.
[87:34.62]This has to be 1.5 meters, right?
[87:36.71]I gotta be kind of on the ball here.
[87:42.91]Not pretending.
[87:45.85]Let me get the Jenga fountain.
[87:50.04]I can't get that, really.
[87:57.37]Fail, fail, fail.
[88:00.31]Yeah, I don't listen to music.
[88:04.35]I'm such a fucking strange person, man.
[88:07.93]I listen to music alone in my office.
[88:11.39]Sitting here.
[88:12.57]And I put on stuff like Pac-Man's theme from Smash Bros.
[88:16.14]Like, the cool one.
[88:18.14]And I listen to it like 17 times in a row.
[88:26.91]Is that weird?
[88:35.06]And then you get to the one part of the... Holy shit, I'm going fast.
[88:39.88]Oh!
[88:40.16]Do it again.
[88:41.54]Do it again.
[88:41.90]Have to do that again.
[88:46.64]So you pick like the one part in the song that you want to hear over and over again.
[88:53.14]You get to that part of the song where it's like the big breakdown and you listen to it like 87 times.
[88:57.56]And then you wonder silently to yourself what like the YouTube data algorithm on your profile looks like and where you've clicked on this same video like 185 times.
[89:11.33]Get out of the way, I need to get a strike.
[89:23.32]Alright, here we go.
[89:25.26]I can't see.
[89:31.94]Oh!
[89:32.46]That's close enough.
[89:35.18]I just got wrecked by a cat.
[89:40.25]You listen to music on YouTube?
[89:42.97]See?
[89:43.43]I told you.
[89:43.95]I knew there was something wrong with it.
[89:46.43]I knew there was something wrong with what I was doing.
[89:54.03]I don't have very much time left.
[89:55.19]I gotta focus here.
[90:01.50]The radishes.
[90:10.16]What you do with music?
[90:11.16]Who's on this bike?
[90:14.89]What you do with music is normal?
[90:16.27]Everybody does that?
[90:17.91]So are people just pretending they don't do that?
[90:22.51]I don't know, because I know a lot of people that have Spotify open, and I don't think they've heard the same song twice.
[90:38.75]Like, oh, I have a Spotify on the Discover mode.
[90:41.60]Yeah, I've probably listened to 14,000 songs in the last, like, five years.
[90:50.40]Wait, I can pick up the water?
[90:53.46]Nah.
[90:57.18]Those are rookie numbers.
[90:58.86]I'm gonna lose.
[91:05.30]1.5, come on.
[91:05.68]Get the dogs.
[91:15.33]Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.
[91:16.51]Get out.
[91:16.83]Out, out, out, out, out.
[91:21.87]Oh fuck.
[91:22.05]Into the supermarket.
[91:22.49]Oh no!
[91:22.61]I'm gonna lose!
[91:22.91]Why are there so many people in the way?
[91:24.11]Get out of the fucking way!
[91:24.65]Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[91:54.22]We were talking about fucking Starburst and shitting out basketballs!
[91:57.83]I didn't fa- I was gonna pay attention.
[92:08.86]Everything you do is kind of lame.
[92:10.22]Nobody wears sharp horns like that anymore.
[92:12.70]And why is your head so wide?
[92:13.82]For the record, there's nothing here.
[92:16.11]Oh, you'll get your stardust today.
[92:17.97]But do a better job next time.
[92:31.35]Do it again.
[92:31.77]Was I really loud right there?
[92:36.07]I don't want to be like the loud guy.
[92:37.37]Uh, have you been to the Netherlands?
[92:47.86]Yeah, it's the same one.
[92:48.94]I'll get it this time.
[92:49.66]Fast.
[92:52.60]You waste the time going back up the hill for the bowling joke.
[92:57.84]But we were talking about...
[93:00.35]I'm talking about how crabs aren't spiders.
[93:06.96]I had to pay attention to that.
[93:07.98]That was more important.
[93:13.97]Alright, 1.5.
[93:16.11]Let's do it.
[93:17.69]In the very beginning I was like, I'm going to take my time and go through it like this.
[93:23.51]Be very careful.
[93:25.26]No, just go.
[93:30.03]Are lobsters spiders?
[93:32.16]Well, no, because lobsters don't... Lobsters look like... Really, they just look like lobsters.
[93:38.24]There's no other animal or crustacean that even looks remotely similar.
[93:46.75]When I look at crab, I think... Okay, that's a spider.
[93:49.45]When I see lobster, I say that's a lobster.
[93:51.87]That's it.
[93:53.13]There's nothing you can even compare a lobster to.
[93:56.43]A shrimp?
[93:59.29]Yeah.
[94:01.43]Yeah, that's just like a big shrimp.
[94:16.95]Nothing compares to you.
[94:18.43]What?
[94:18.55]What are you...
[94:27.90]Am I, like, accidentally, purposely avoiding all the shit I need to pick up right now?
[94:34.91]Oh yeah, there was a scorpion in the house today.
[94:36.47]That was fucking different.
[94:40.25]I've never seen one before.
[94:43.49]I have not seen a scorpion in real life, ever.
[94:45.69]Until, like, two hours ago.
[94:47.99]Like, an hour ago.
[94:56.52]Finally a game that punishes stalling.
[94:58.92]Well, that's why we're not stalling anymore.
[95:04.80]Did I freak out?
[95:05.58]No, because it was already dead.
[95:10.88]I talked to Talix about it.
[95:12.71]I was like, did you kill a scorpion down here?
[95:17.39]No.
[95:18.71]Oh.
[95:21.22]It was really weird.
[95:22.77]And we don't think the dogs had anything to do with it.
[95:25.63]Maybe one of the dogs went after it and got it.
[95:28.19]I don't know.
[95:28.57]You gotta be careful there, though, because... A dog can get actually very seriously injured from a scorpion or a large insect.
[95:43.48]So, we have like a little talk about what we need to do.
[95:49.05]And we need to start to kind of... Because it's weird that it's December.
[95:52.09]A scorpion in December.
[95:55.43]I thought all bugs... Don't bugs go to hell?
[95:59.62]Well, I mean, all bugs go to hell.
[96:01.16]But, I mean, they disappear.
[96:04.90]For, like, the winter months.
[96:12.56]That's why it was inside.
[96:13.62]All bugs go to Valhalla.
[96:21.56]No, are you kidding me?
[96:23.46]It's like if a scorpion was in, like, crawled in front of Odin.
[96:26.46]No, he's so strong.
[96:28.60]That's me, Odin.
[96:29.66]I'm the most powerful.
[96:31.74]Oh, it's a scorpion.
[96:32.34]Get it out of here.
[96:33.18]Thor.
[96:34.06]Thor, help me, Thor.
[96:36.72]And Thor comes in.
[96:37.48]What is it, father?
[96:38.54]Ew, ew.
[96:42.81]And then Thor is like, don't worry, I will use my hammer.
[96:47.12]And, oh, it grows!
[96:49.14]Loki!
[96:50.66]And then somebody finally like throws a grom at it and kills it.
[97:05.47]Could you miss any more items?
[97:08.70]I was supposed to be paying attention.
[97:09.88]All right, no more fucking around.
[97:23.15]Did you miss any more items?
[97:31.73]You know, you're right, they do have a point.
[97:36.93]I can't just leave it up to the last 10 seconds, you know what I mean?
[97:39.72]I gotta get big now.
[97:44.58]You know, turn on the infomercial.
[97:47.98]I used to look like you.
[97:50.28]Scrawny, small.
[97:53.64]And then I started drinking... Jex juice!
[97:59.00]Oh, by the way, all this is is just Malta Dextrin.
[98:03.26]A shitload of it.
[98:11.64]And some chocolate powder.
[98:18.01]I can't get up there, fuck.
[98:26.12]Just dodging items.
[98:29.46]I need to just shut up and play, man.
[98:34.57]Did my brain subconsciously think this was an Envoy the Object game?
[98:40.69]I'm sitting here talking, and I'm, oh, watch out, I don't want to run into anything.
[98:46.70]Alright, I got bigger.
[98:53.22]Alright, eight minutes, I got enough time.
[98:57.96]I want to pick up the shit on your car, man.
[99:00.28]Get all the envelopes.
[99:08.18]Get the Nintendo.
[99:11.42]I can't pick up the Nintendo?
[99:15.74]Alright, I need to change locations.
[99:21.36]Only 35 centimeters.
[99:25.08]Alright, this is where we pick up the whole world.
[99:44.13]Pick up all the soda bottles.
[99:45.11]There's a lot more soda bottles over here.
[99:48.39]Good.
[99:52.78]I could go for one of those teas.
[99:56.28]Yeah, playing Katamari, you really need to have snacks available.
[100:01.48]And that one's going to go through here.
[100:02.68]There's a way through there.
[100:06.51]So, I'm going to wrap around.
[100:07.77]I'm going to get a little bit bigger first.
[100:12.69]Get all the crabs.
[100:14.51]Or at least most of them.
[100:16.35]Now it's hiding.
[100:17.10]Don't even worry about it.
[100:17.76]Nintendo.
[100:18.20]Can I pick up the Nintendo?
[100:19.80]Now I can.
[100:20.42]Okay.
[100:25.60]Katamari is about hitting the wall and stalling.
[100:29.61]How dare you say that.
[100:32.69]What?
[100:33.43]I'm not big enough to go through there?
[100:42.33]Stop.
[100:42.71]Don't make me laugh.
[100:46.19]Don't make me laugh.
[100:47.37]Not when I'm playing Katamari Damacy.
[100:58.86]Strike.
[101:07.55]Doing way better than I did last time.
[101:09.60]So... Wait.
[101:11.70]I can't pick up the full watermelons?
[101:12.88]I can only pick up half watermelons.
[101:15.18]What kind of video game do you think you are?
[101:21.81]This is where... I'm gonna have a lot of time to exponentially take out everything in here.
[101:33.36]Solar panels?
[101:38.44]Please move Can I pick these up yet?
[101:51.13]I feel like I did the same stupid shit last time I definitely did
[102:04.01]Is this the guy that runs into walls and stalls playing Katamari?
[102:07.63]The Melon's Germo.
[102:19.20]I couldn't get him.
[102:19.90]I could get him now.
[102:20.54]I couldn't get him.
[102:22.46]I couldn't do it.
[102:23.00]Alright, let's take a trip over here.
[102:33.46]Try to pick up as many radishes as I can, because they're pretty large.
[102:36.40]I'm gonna go out here again.
[102:41.07]Back to the street.
[102:43.47]Anything else that I missed over here?
[102:44.55]There's a guy lying down.
[102:45.69]Okay.
[102:48.75]Well, that didn't do anything I thought that was gonna do.
[102:51.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[102:56.62]What was there? 150.
[103:04.94]Get the sign at the barber.
[103:08.24]Can't get the sign.
[103:11.50]I'm going back up.
[103:14.39]Because there's a lot of shit that I can get over here now, that I couldn't previously.
[103:17.69]Alright, this'll be easy now.
[103:33.17]He's too fat.
[103:36.08]I mean, am I?
[103:36.80]I'm not really, though.
[103:39.00]That's good, I want to be huge down these halls, so I can just accidentally pick up everything.
[103:49.17]Yeah, take down this whole wall.
[103:51.45]I got the phone.
[103:58.91]This may have actually been a terrible idea, you're right.
[104:00.62]I gotta stay on the road.
[104:06.86]This was a very bad idea.
[104:14.73]This was a very bad idea.
[104:16.01]Oh no, this was a terrible fucking idea.
[104:26.84]Get back down here.
[104:27.74]Down, back down, back down.
[104:28.60]Forget about everything here.
[104:29.32]Go.
[104:36.84]Oh, shit.
[104:41.94]Shit!
[104:43.12]What have I done?
[104:49.07]Get the cat.
[104:53.53]What the fuck have I done?
[104:54.53]Oh, I'm so mad.
[105:01.86]What was I fucking talking- I said Thor's name and it's angering me.
[105:11.16]I'm actually fucked here I think I can fit I can't jump
[105:37.00]I can't fit through this at... Oh, I'm so mad at myself.
[105:40.40]You have no idea.
[105:41.00]I'm fucking furious with myself.
[105:46.95]I am furious with myself.
[105:52.45]Because I went back up here, and now I can't go back down.
[105:55.91]I am absolutely livid.
[106:07.72]Why did I come back up here?
[106:11.30]Why?
[106:11.72]What was the purpose of coming up here?
[106:53.37]Why can I... Why could I even... Okay, here's what I don't understand.
[106:56.31]Why could I fit back through there the first time?
[106:59.42]And then when I lost, like, 25 centimeters, I couldn't go back down.
[107:02.94]Okay.
[107:17.07]God fucking damn it.
[107:18.55]I really, like, I told... All right, why are you paying attention this time?
[107:21.25]Let's talk about Thor, like, throwing darts at Scorpion.
[107:45.67]It's a sweaty try-hard time.
[107:47.61]It is.
[107:48.09]I'm not going to lose this one.
[107:49.95]We want some grace back in the sky.
[107:51.85]But the swans don't seem to have hatched yet.
[107:54.35]Pick up eggs.
[107:56.27]Don't nobody talk about any other topics besides Katamari.
[108:06.12]Get as many as you can and make as... Okay, I've got to pick up as many eggs as I can.
[108:11.40]Seven minutes.
[108:14.78]I'm not talking about anything else.
[108:15.94]Look at Katamari eggs.
[108:17.00]Where do I go from here?
[108:18.48]To the left.
[108:20.60]Pick up more of these eggs.
[108:23.00]Cool.
[108:23.40]All right.
[108:23.78]Eggs.
[108:24.00]Make sure I get them all.
[108:29.12]Am I big enough?
[108:33.12]Yes, I am.
[108:33.58]I can get these ones.
[108:35.18]Focus on them.
[108:37.88]Watch out.
[108:38.20]You don't... Well, it's going to happen every time I do this.
[108:43.36]like 30 eggs
[109:01.39]Okay, I got four.
[109:02.61]Wait, four.
[109:06.14]Wait, they can't be broken.
[109:08.94]Oh, shit.
[109:09.58]Why does that one not count?
[109:11.22]They have to be swans.
[109:29.32]You know what they say, you don't make eggs without one.
[109:36.98]Yeah, this is a beautiful song.
[109:44.16]Don't fall off.
[109:45.00]Get them off.
[109:47.41]Cool.
[109:48.23]How many spawns do I need?
[109:48.99]Just as many as I can get?
[109:50.37]There's a lot up here.
[110:04.28]Some of them are not going to be swamped.
[110:05.84]I'm going to try to get 50 swamped.
[110:08.64]That's a number that's way too high.
[110:11.28]Another one.
[110:20.23]That's just a regular egg.
[110:22.49]Is that hitting eggs with a golf club?
[110:25.66]What a sick fuck.
[110:26.32]Let's sit here for a second and get them all.
[110:28.72]How did I miss that?
[110:48.25]What is a swan anyway?
[110:50.27]No, don't get me talking.
[110:51.91]Do not get me to talk.
[110:54.47]I can't be trusted when I start speaking.
[111:03.65]Silent stream.
[111:05.23]I'm gonna go underneath, because I'm still small enough to get these.
[111:17.96]If I got stuck under there, I would've just... I would've just swallowed the switch.
[111:21.84]I would've been the first person to ever eat a switch.
[111:25.54]Oh, you... Momentum, come on.
[111:47.63]You can't get angry.
[111:49.31]Yes, you can.
[111:50.97]Oh, yes, you can.
[111:52.33]I was going to say, with the soundtrack playing in the background.
[111:56.66]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[112:17.87]Alright.
[112:19.29]We suspect.
[112:20.27]Alright, I got 24.
[112:21.49]What do I want?
[112:23.47]50?
[112:23.61]I'm probably only gonna get 25.
[112:27.21]Although I haven't gone up here.
[112:29.68]Can I get up there?
[112:30.24]Alright.
[112:34.14]Duckling, duckling, swan!
[112:36.02]25!
[112:36.04]Can I make it up this way?
[112:37.66]No.
[112:47.03]Say something.
[112:47.73]No, like, not, not yet.
[112:49.05]This one's very specific.
[112:54.19]I gotta get to 30.
[112:57.05]You know what I'm saying?
[113:01.39]I gotta get to 30.
[113:02.11]I mean, I don't understand.
[113:03.39]I just got, what, 30? 29.
[113:22.58]30.
[113:24.20]I'm gonna climb up on a shoe to get up here.
[113:29.54]Get up there, dude.
[113:31.12]What are you doing?
[113:32.04]What are you doing?
[113:36.24]It can't be a weird number like 31.
[113:37.52]It's gotta be like 45 or something, right?
[113:47.44]How many characters were in the last Smash Bros.
[113:48.98]game?
[113:51.29]42?
[113:51.31]43?
[113:52.06]That's how much we need.
[114:04.21]I can't live with this if it's 36.
[114:05.97]Here we go, I'll get some here.
[114:14.35]You have one minute left. 38.
[114:23.42]39.
[114:23.72]No, don't do 39.
[114:25.90]It's gonna be 41.
[114:27.03]I'm gonna stop playing after I get to 40.
[114:34.35]45.
[114:34.53]45.
[114:34.57]Get it.
[114:34.75]50.
[114:36.37]I can get 50.
[114:38.07]Don't sell yourself under what you would assume.
[114:43.52]No, not 46!
[115:13.28]Oh, 46!
[115:19.40]Very graceful, and a bit disturbing.
[115:23.56]Tweet, tweet, tweet noisy things will take the graceful rainbow back.
[115:28.58]Thank you.
[115:32.20]Restart.
[115:32.50]46 is not bad, that's 65%.
[115:33.56]That's a D.
[115:42.83]All you have to do is pass.
[115:47.18]46 Swans.
[115:51.44]Commonplace Grace.
[115:52.48]Skin Deep Grace.
[115:54.02]Fake Grace.
[115:54.75]Grace Light.
[115:56.49]It'll be a counterfeit constellation.
[115:58.83]There will be a pale imitation of a swan in the sky.
[116:02.23]Alrighty, let's just release it into the sky.
[116:03.89]He's mad at me for getting a D on my report card.
[116:11.77]You need a 70 to pass.
[116:13.47]Since when?
[116:15.49]What are you guys on about?
[116:23.33]Since when do you need a 70?
[116:24.91]A 70 is a C-.
[116:25.39]Did they change the way the grading is done?
[116:50.41]What do you mean, yes?
[116:52.57]A 60 is a D minus.
[116:57.07]70 is now a D minus.
[116:58.19]So what's 80?
[116:58.55]That doesn't make any sense.
[117:02.01]70 is a D minus, 80 is a C minus, 90 is a B minus, and 100 is what, an A minus?
[117:09.15]How do you get an A plus?
[117:09.97]80 is a B minus.
[117:12.95]What are you guys talking about?
[117:21.70]Anything below 80 is an F. D is a fa- Alright, I'm doing this one.
[117:34.71]It's not 10% per letter?
[117:41.27]I'm being fucked with here.
[117:42.51]60 to 69 is a D.
[117:44.47]60 is a D-, 69 is a D+.
[117:45.25]70 is a C-, 79 is a C+.
[117:45.73]What, am I, are people just making me feel...
[118:07.72]Talk about anything besides school.
[118:10.04]Alright, I'm gonna do this one now.
[118:16.24]70 is a B. No.
[118:18.18]No, it's not.
[118:20.16]Whatever.
[118:22.32]It's not a... Whatever.
[118:26.52]I used... I was a teacher.
[118:27.98]I was a substitute teacher, guys.
[118:29.39]I know how to grade papers.
[118:44.28]I didn't do any grading, by the way.
[118:48.11]I talked with a fake English accent.
[118:51.89]And would draw pictures on the board and stuff.
[119:00.94]Why am I trying to pay attention?
[119:02.94]What's with this level and causing my brain to turn off?
[119:21.40]Oh yeah, I've talked about that many times before.
[119:30.33]I'm staying over with the fruits.
[119:32.13]This is a different route this time.
[119:33.42]This is the fruit route.
[119:46.43]Missed gift.
[119:47.94]No, I didn't.
[119:49.52]No, I didn't.
[119:50.80]And you can't prove that.
[119:55.60]Golden fruit split.
[120:01.65]What a joy of a video game.
[120:03.05]Can I just, let's be real.
[120:05.55]You know what I mean?
[120:06.05]Does anybody else think that?
[120:15.14]I'm so glad that they remade this.
[120:18.62]It deserved it.
[120:24.79]First crash of the evening.
[120:27.87]Or this level, I mean.
[120:39.92]First crash of the evening.
[120:42.34]That's not true at all.
[120:46.73]Watch out for the goats.
[120:49.13]I know, you're gonna say that's a dog.
[120:50.25]Those are goats.
[120:51.49]That is a goat face.
[121:03.70]Much better than last time.
[121:09.38]Nobody brought up any comic book characters.
[121:10.94]I didn't talk about, like, orchestras.
[121:16.24]There's no reference to shitting.
[121:18.26]And look at how good I'm doing.
[121:21.79]Let me take a look.
[121:30.98]Anything else over here I can do?
[121:31.84]Nah, I can't even go that way.
[121:38.23]Is this a sponsored stream?
[121:42.74]Is that even happening?
[121:43.70]Why would they sponsor people to play this?
[121:50.44]No, it's not.
[122:00.60]Why else would I play this?
[122:05.14]No, don't start.
[122:06.04]Don't start it.
[122:07.12]You're in the middle of doing very well.
[122:11.54]See?
[122:12.40]I controlled myself.
[122:17.68]Now, if you're new to the channel here on Twitch, I do not do sponsored content on the channel.
[122:25.79]That is a guarantee.
[122:32.71]We're all new.
[122:43.02]That's not to say I never will for any reason, but I probably won't.
[122:46.36]I cannot see a scenario where I ever would.
[122:57.10]Is that a money-back guarantee?
[123:05.41]Covering his tracks again.
[123:06.65]Okay, hold on.
[123:09.45]When was the last sponsored thing you saw on this stream?
[123:13.17]Time's up, because the answer is it's never happened.
[123:17.67]That's never happened.
[123:18.99]It's been like three years.
[123:20.13]Sponsored by JetBlue.
[123:24.86]No, I just said that JetBlue is a fantastic fucking airplane company.
[123:29.58]That's quality, and I've never had a problem with them.
[123:32.02]That's not a sponsorship, that's me talking about a service that I've purchased that I liked.
[123:42.04]Brain fluid.
[123:43.90]Yeah, but they didn't even pay me.
[123:44.88]The guy that made the company fucking... I got like a bunch of weird emails.
[123:54.59]They were all broken up and... It was almost like there was a lot of typos and shit.
[124:00.35]He said that the check, it was for 40 grand.
[124:02.72]That's why I did it.
[124:04.62]And he said I would get it within two business days of doing the sponsorship.
[124:12.25]And it was a little weird because I had to send money to him first.
[124:17.86]To prove that my bank account could be linked to his.
[124:20.44]So I'm still kind of waiting.
[124:23.78]I sent to get it to work.
[124:33.54]Alright, we've got eight minutes.
[124:38.36]Yeah, I mean, it was two business days, and that was... Was that, like, a year ago now?
[124:44.76]So... I mean, maybe I got, like, stuck or lost in the mail or something.
[124:48.21]And it's weird, because every time I send a message to that email address, I get back the mailer-like Damon thing, whatever it is, the Matt Damon mailer, that says that the address doesn't exist or something, which is weird.
[125:00.33]I'm trying to get him to send me his new email.
[125:02.62]I'm sure he will.
[125:10.75]Nintendo, give me it.
[125:17.25]Oh no, he's getting distracted again.
[125:19.83]Can't get the cat.
[125:39.05]car.
[125:40.74]Alright, this time when I go down, I'm not going back up.
[125:47.26]Not going down there yet.
[125:48.18]Let me get a couple more things in here, because this place I didn't go is right over here.
[125:56.75]Okay.
[125:57.65]Now I'm going down.
[126:04.38]Watch out for the people that are blocking my path.
[126:06.22]That's the only reason why they're up here, is just to walk back and forth and be annoying.
[126:14.14]See?
[126:14.36]Alright, that one's... I've got over five minutes to do this.
[126:25.52]More than halfway there.
[126:37.53]Make sure I don't want to miss anything.
[126:39.43]Get the pineapple, Jerma!
[126:40.43]Get the pineapple!
[126:41.15]Jerma, the pineapple!
[126:42.01]The pineapple!
[126:42.51]Get the pineapple, Jerma!
[126:44.51]Jerma, get the pineapple!
[126:46.45]Jerma, get the pineapple!
[126:47.66]Okay!
[126:48.34]Jesus Christ!
[126:53.08]Jesus!
[126:53.64]Need a little shoes.
[127:10.61]Alright, almost at one meter, and then it gets easier.
[127:13.85]What are you- why do the people have to be just in the fucking way?
[127:29.51]Get away from me!
[127:36.55]I'm gonna get all the radishes and all the fruits here.
[127:39.15]It's just free.
[127:40.61]And it's a lot of sp- it gets a lot of space.
[127:44.28]Takes up a lot of space on the actual Katamari.
[127:58.05]It's very heavy, that's why it takes a while to roll it.
[128:00.11]It's a heavy piece of equipment.
[128:04.94]Okay.
[128:05.68]Now we're gonna cross this way.
[128:08.36]Pick up a couple of these baskets.
[128:13.32]Up and across.
[128:13.94]Here we go.
[128:15.24]I beat the level.
[128:15.88]I won.
[128:20.24]Now nobody can pull back this VOD and be like... That's what a lot of you guys do.
[128:26.30]I get through a certain part of the game that I have trouble with and then you just sit there and go...
[128:40.82]Get on stage.
[128:44.84]Take all this guy's stuff.
[128:46.74]Those are huge.
[128:47.64]Come on.
[128:47.96]1.5.
[128:48.08]Almost there.
[128:48.74]Yeah, this is done.
[128:58.51]Now it begins.
[129:01.45]This is the guy that died to Pinwheel on stream.
[129:03.09]I did.
[129:06.97]Yeah, it was really bad.
[129:08.57]I lost like 30 times in a row.
[129:15.47]I think that evening, I think I lost 600 or 700 subscribers to the channel.
[129:22.74]Because I died to Pinwheel on like the 20th or 30th attempt.
[129:25.98]I remember just like, chat was... We got a huge argument.
[129:29.31]It was like, dude, you are so fucking terrible.
[129:31.47]And I went off.
[129:32.63]I was like, let me tell you something, chat.
[129:37.17]I was talking about, like, how Pinwheel is hard, and, like, I think the word I used was, like, the dumb idiots or something like that.
[129:44.78]And it was, like, a thousand subs it left overnight.
[129:47.68]It was really bad for the channel.
[130:06.91]Can I get two?
[130:10.55]What?
[130:10.83]Is there a cat?
[130:12.21]What is Duck Hunt Dog doing up there?
[130:14.83]And yes, I'm going to make references to Spanish Brothers because I've been playing it recently.
[130:18.22]Well, I can't move from here, so a good thing I beat it.
[130:35.04]That lady just did a backflip for no reason.
[130:39.28]I guess I can pick up the people now.
[130:42.64]Still not two meters.
[130:47.37]Give me the two!
[130:48.17]Come on, I'm gonna grow a little bit higher.
[130:51.21]And then... no, not another level?
[130:54.49]I gotta be close to getting a little bigger.
[131:03.04]These are good.
[131:12.74]You all laughed at me when I was small.
[131:17.04]And look at you now.
[131:30.43]What about this guy?
[131:31.33]Let's rip him off the pole.
[131:39.91]Now I know why Jerma likes this game.
[131:41.72]Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's really, really funny.
[131:44.98]That's very funny.
[131:47.32]That's gonna be when Twitch finally does their awards, right?
[131:51.02]You know how you see like the gamer awards?
[131:53.25]It's like the one- no, eventually, I'm gonna predict this, but timestamp this.
[131:58.13]In like the next year or two, Twitch is going to have its own award show for a bunch of different Twitch-related awards.
[132:06.37]It's gonna be the Twitch Awards!
[132:07.85]And it'll be a whole thing, it'll do it at probably TwitchCon.
[132:10.53]I'm sorry, I, that's, it's gonna happen.
[132:13.83]And when they do that, they're gonna pull back, they'll, it'll be like, Best Chat Joke!
[132:18.66]And there'll be nominees on screen and you'll get to go.
[132:22.42]You'll be sitting there next to the guy that said Resident Sleeper.
[132:25.88]Like he spammed it during a boring part of a video game.
[132:33.37]That one will probably be nominated.
[132:47.15]Why are people writing Santa hat?
[132:53.78]I don't understand why- Santa hat.
[132:55.82]Santa hat.
[132:57.54]Ice cube.
[132:58.00]I don't- what is this?
[132:59.30]If it were ours, we'd make it much bigger.
[133:07.28]The thing that you collected the most of is vegetables.
[133:09.78]Oh, I got lots of vegetables.
[133:11.04]Good.
[133:14.25]I don't have, uh, better TV.
[133:18.83]No, and I'm never gonna have it.
[133:19.93]I'm never gonna download it.
[133:22.38]I have a bright white background and default emotes.
[133:41.94]I saw him!
[133:42.50]I saw him outside!
[133:43.34]He was just standing there.
[133:55.53]Why?
[133:55.79]King of the Cosmos should be in Smash Bros.
[133:57.93]Shouldn't he?
[134:09.51]Too big?
[134:10.07]Oh, that was the Ridley excuse.
[134:11.39]And we got Ridley, so I don't buy that one anymore.
[134:26.04]Alright, uh, make Corona Borealis Any other ones we have so far here?
[134:33.34]Make a star six Let's do the Corona
[134:51.08]What is it?
[134:51.62]It still needs something.
[134:53.20]Is it our royal present?
[134:54.36]No, something more.
[134:56.08]Oh, yes.
[134:57.02]It's not gorgeous.
[134:58.04]The sky is not gorgeous at all.
[135:00.96]A starry sky, and it still manages to look shabby.
[135:04.02]It has gone.
[135:04.84]It has none of the beauteous, maximal gorgeousness of our crown.
[135:14.26]What do you mean, the year?
[135:14.96]What are you talking about?
[135:25.68]Can somebody describe what the Santa hat emote is?
[135:28.68]Describe what it is.
[135:30.12]Oh, it's balding.
[135:32.26]Amazing, amazing.
[135:32.94]The earth looks amazing today.
[135:34.84]What's this?
[135:35.24]Crowns everywhere.
[135:36.08]It's just a Santa hat.
[135:40.82]What does it look like?
[135:41.80]Is it on somebody?
[135:46.27]It puts a hat on an emote.
[135:53.06]So it's just, it's a Santa hat that looks like it's on top of a emote.
[135:59.50]Okay.
[136:00.78]Alright, gotta pick up crowns.
[136:01.70]Let's roll them all up before somebody shows up!
[136:04.18]Get as many as you can.
[136:08.38]Super fab gorgeous sky.
[136:10.94]These crowns must belong to someone, there are just too many.
[136:13.74]If a likely person shows up, we'll make a getaway to the great cosmos.
[136:17.64]In the meantime, we have nine minutes.
[136:19.56]Hurry, pilfering prince.
[136:25.68]That one felt real fucking good.
[136:33.15]That was a cheeseburger.
[136:34.57]That was the Burger King.
[136:35.59]I missed something up there.
[136:36.39]Fuck it, who cares.
[136:39.33]Need crowns.
[136:41.11]Not like baking soda.
[136:54.03]I love the dogs driving the car, sharing a crown.
[136:58.41]What are they moving?
[136:59.30]What are they rolling?
[137:00.24]They're pushing a can.
[137:05.70]Why does this have to exist?
[137:11.62]Still looking for crowns.
[137:14.83]This is gonna be annoying, I'm sorry guys.
[137:24.90]Hello!
[137:25.80]Hello!
[137:26.90]This is the king!
[137:27.68]Hello, yes this is dog!
[137:33.10]He should have said that.
[137:37.60]How funny would that have been?
[137:44.42]Get all the swords.
[137:45.10]I need to get a... I gotta get bigger.
[137:46.44]Forget about the crowns right now.
[137:47.84]I need to grow.
[137:48.32]Alright, one more.
[138:04.43]I gotta level up.
[138:11.00]What even is this game?
[138:11.74]This is Katamari Damacy Rerolled.
[138:13.62]It's a game where you start small and have to roll up any object you can possibly roll up.
[138:18.70]That's right, you can even roll up anything.
[138:21.46]Everything is roll-uppable eventually.
[138:23.31]You progress through the game and you have to make stars.
[138:27.21]And it is a one-of-a-kind.
[138:29.71]You have never experienced it before.
[138:32.05]Oh, is there a treat waiting for you?
[138:40.62]And Cloud was confirmed, so... I mean, that's cool, right?
[138:52.12]Santa Please Santa Hat.
[138:53.80]What?
[138:54.70]No, Sour Please Santa Hat.
[139:02.24]Sponsored stream.
[139:03.94]Alright, next person that says sponsored stream... You are getting FREE TICKETS TO DISNEYLAND!
[139:13.42]No, you're not.
[139:13.84]That's a joke.
[139:14.32]I'm kidding.
[139:24.25]Oh, did I say Disneyland?
[139:26.21]Oh, I'm sorry.
[139:26.99]What I meant to say was we're going to go to the website Disneyland.
[139:31.85]You get free tickets for me to show you the website Disneyland.
[139:36.92]We're going to go on a virtual Disneyland tour together.
[139:39.46]That's what I meant.
[139:41.38]I didn't say you physically were getting tickets to physically go to Disneyland, you get tickets to go to the virtual tour of Disneyland on my stream!
[139:50.15]Now I have to do that.
[139:50.93]I need so many more crowns.
[139:59.76]Hold on, go to the dark house.
[140:11.31]Scammed.
[140:12.61]I wonder, okay, how much would that actually cost?
[140:14.49]I wonder what it is.
[140:15.31]Are there 4,200 people here?
[140:17.43]Isn't a Disneyland ticket like fucking 400 bucks?
[140:23.48]What's 400 times 4,200?
[140:27.24]And what's 4,200 times all the money that would have to be paid for plane tickets?
[140:32.37]That's like 20 million dollars.
[140:39.88]Alright, I need crowns.
[140:45.56]Now that I've gotten large enough.
[140:51.65]Go to Disneyland if you see a crown, okay?
[140:53.91]Anybody that sees a crown can scream Disneyland.
[140:56.29]And then they'll, you know... You know what I mean.
[140:58.91]Disneyland.
[141:07.93]I'm not big enough for that one.
[141:09.25]I'll get one of the guy's bomb.
[141:12.64]Nope, falling off.
[141:15.88]There are a lot of crowns down here, though.
[141:18.62]But I'm not- I can't get up on these.
[141:19.94]I can barely get them.
[141:27.58]I believe you owe me some tickets.
[141:37.45]Get bigger.
[141:38.81]I'm trying.
[141:39.45]Three tickets to Disneyland.
[141:55.08]Just get bigger already.
[141:56.66]Just go to Disneyland already.
[142:19.05]I'm kidding.
[142:19.61]I know the present is there.
[142:28.05]What's in it?
[142:29.07]One of our royal presents.
[142:30.49]It's tickets to Disneyland!
[142:45.08]Free tickets to Disneyland.
[142:49.48]When was the last time you guys went to Disneyland?
[142:57.52]Overused joke!
[142:58.64]We just made it five minutes ago!
[143:02.06]We just brought that up, like, not even ten minutes ago!
[143:04.25]Old joke!
[143:16.26]When was the last time Disneyland went to you?
[143:18.64]Does it count if you hire, like, a Mickey Mouse mascot to dance at a Christmas party?
[143:24.04]Not a Christmas party.
[143:25.64]A birthday party.
[143:26.94]I only have 30 of these.
[143:32.31]I need more crowns.
[143:34.31]How did I miss all of them?
[143:45.47]Christmas party.
[143:46.50]What kind of fucked up Christmas party is that?
[143:58.13]Can I get these?
[144:00.47]Ah!
[144:01.41]Yes.
[144:05.69]Big crown.
[144:08.76]That's a huge crown right there, and I can't touch it.
[144:10.76]I hate this.
[144:11.48]I want that.
[144:14.84]I can't pick that one up.
[144:26.08]You have one minute left to get... I gotta get to 50, right?
[144:30.98]Or... You can't fit through there.
[144:34.70]Why?
[144:37.98]It's over.
[144:38.80]I ruined it again.
[144:41.65]No, it's okay.
[144:42.01]Are you sponsored by Disney?
[144:44.69]No.
[144:46.19]No, I'm not sponsored by Disney.
[144:47.73]No one gets Disneyland tickets.
[144:50.01]It was a reference to a TV show.
[144:53.03]I was watching a TV show where the host gave out tickets to Disneyland to everybody in the audience.
[145:01.67]It may have been... It may have been Oprah.
[145:18.33]43.
[145:18.41]It can't be a number like that.
[145:20.07]I will restart the whole the fucking level if it's 43.
[145:21.89]It's got to be like even.
[145:23.17]45 or something.
[145:25.27]44, thank god!
[145:30.45]Someone's coming.
[145:33.45]Oh, we can't open our eyes.
[145:34.77]It's too dazzling.
[145:35.51]Let's take a look at our rainbow.
[145:42.64]45 is not even 44 is.
[145:44.20]Boy, we failed that one, but it's alright.
[145:45.91]You sometimes are good enough.
[145:52.11]Well, it's 44 crowns, only a measly 44, so it'll be a bland constellation.
[145:57.35]Here, this is our royal present.
[145:59.11]It's a crown.
[146:00.29]Guess what?
[146:00.73]Guess what this is?
[146:01.93]Alrighty, let's just release it into the sky.
[146:13.44]We're still on the same level from an hour ago?
[146:15.86]Well, that was the same area, different mission.
[146:25.31]That looked like shit.
[146:27.13]You said crap.
[146:27.77]I don't know why I turned it into a swear.
[146:29.15]There was no reason for me to do that.
[146:30.91]I just transferred what you said.
[146:32.17]You said, this looks like crap.
[146:33.83]And I said shit.
[146:38.64]Uh, thank you, uh, human.
[146:40.74]Human gave...
[146:43.89]Ten community subs earlier.
[146:45.35]Thank you, Cuman.
[146:47.81]Appreciate it.
[146:49.27]Ten.
[146:52.20]Community subs.
[146:53.24]I missed them, I didn't see them.
[146:57.70]But we have to crown them, we can't have the scarf on.
[146:59.50]That's kind of... Give us more slots, Valve.
[147:02.68]What the hell?
[147:15.88]Yeah, we'll keep the crown on.
[147:17.68]Looks good.
[147:26.19]Sponsored by Valve.
[147:36.13]Megastar 6?
[147:36.53]Let's see what we've opened up.
[147:39.68]Is that the only one?
[147:42.72]I think that's the only one.
[147:45.31]Is this the end of the game?
[147:48.55]Level 6.
[147:54.15]So when are you gonna go back to beat Dark Souls 3 without taking damage?
[147:58.33]I wouldn't be able to do that for a million dollars.
[148:03.05]Like, for literally a million dollars, I wouldn't be able to do it.
[148:08.37]Have you ever been to the Arabian Peninsula?
[148:10.19]We haven't either.
[148:10.87]We hope you can visit during the day's rolling.
[148:16.95]Really?
[148:17.88]Could you, okay, could you right now, if somebody sat down with a briefcase and said, there's a million dollars in cash here, and it's just ready for you to take it, and it's been taxed, it's been pre-taxed, so you're fine, like, that's it, it's just cash.
[148:33.59]But you have to beat Dark Souls 3 without taking one hit.
[148:38.97]Like, right there, in front of, like, right there, right now, in front of this guy.
[148:47.75]That would be easy.
[148:50.41]Yes, that would be dumb not to do it, but how would- you wouldn't be able to do it.
[148:52.69]It would be impossible.
[148:56.61]You gave your present away to somebody on Earth.
[148:58.59]Must be around somewhere.
[148:59.43]Roll it up while you ride it.
[149:02.71]Whoa, you guys got real fucking dark.
[149:07.52]It's not impo- it is not impossible.
[149:11.11]But what's gonna happen is you're gonna, because you haven't played Dark Souls 3 in like seven months, you're gonna load it up and be like, I'm gonna try, I'm gonna at least give it my first attempt.
[149:18.61]And you're gonna get hit by like the third enemy.
[149:21.41]You're gonna be in the graveyard, and you're gonna fuck up a dodge because you haven't played in a while, and you're gonna take the hit.
[149:27.21]And he's gonna go, grab the briefcase, close it up, be like, she let it fucking lose her.
[149:34.21]And he walks out, but it was so close, it was right there in front of you.
[149:40.21]All right, we need a crisp three meters.
[149:50.48]Just tackle him.
[149:52.12]I'm sorry about that.
[149:53.64]There are 30 bodyguards with him.
[149:57.08]Like, sorry.
[149:59.23]Oh, just like steal it.
[150:00.49]I'll take it from him.
[150:01.61]Okay, good luck.
[150:10.16]And these 30 bodyguards are so big that they can barely fit in your bedroom.
[150:14.66]Like, only two of them can fit in your room.
[150:17.14]They're like seven feet tall.
[150:19.62]And they weigh at least like 290 to 350 pounds each.
[150:27.81]And just because you lost so quickly, one of the huge bodyguards just fucking karate chops your desk and it crumbles in half.
[150:50.36]Why would he do that?
[150:51.04]I don't know.
[150:53.30]You invited these guys here.
[150:54.70]You let these guys come into your house.
[150:57.18]Okay?
[150:57.86]You have to be ready to take the potential, like, desk chop.
[151:07.65]Let me know he didn't.
[151:09.16]What do you mean no reason?
[151:11.23]A guy just comes in your house.
[151:12.71]Hey, hey, hey.
[151:14.71]Doorbell rings.
[151:16.17]Oh, it's fucking like 7 o'clock in the morning.
[151:17.81]I'm like tired.
[151:18.23]I haven't even had coffee.
[151:19.33]Who's at the door?
[151:20.73]Here's a million dollars in this briefcase.
[151:23.16]The Geeky Geeky Dark Souls 3.
[151:30.60]Hold on, the cell phone's over here.
[151:40.91]No, I can't turn off slow mode.
[151:45.18]There's too many- there's so many people here.
[151:48.34]There's over 4,000 people here.
[151:56.15]Well, look at this guys.
[151:57.33]I just got like five million dollars.
[152:09.34]Coward.
[152:10.46]I want to be able to read what people are saying.
[152:13.54]It gets hard.
[152:14.32]I don't want it to be a situation where... I kind of have to... It's a series of weird compromises, right?
[152:22.10]Because I don't want slow-mo to be impossible to talk, but then I don't want the chat just to be like... It's hard.
[152:33.77]It's hard, okay?
[152:38.76]Stack of bears.
[152:39.50]I'll go get them.
[152:52.23]They're over here, right?
[152:59.78]Look at these bears.
[153:02.62]I can't even pick them up.
[153:03.50]Why did you tell me to do that?
[153:04.50]Come on, let's clear the chat.
[153:24.03]Alright, here we go.
[153:27.03]Is that a vessel?
[153:29.08]What the fuck is going on over here?
[153:33.16]Alright!
[153:53.44]Alright, what can I go?
[153:54.24]I just want to, like, explore.
[153:55.68]I don't even care about picking things up anymore.
[154:03.66]Eventually I'll get out there.
[154:04.62]Pick up these at least?
[154:08.89]Yes.
[154:13.95]Holy shit, Sour Fleet.
[154:20.36]That's the emote where the guy's doing like a Fortnite dance, right?
[154:25.68]Is it the Fortnite emote?
[154:32.13]No.
[154:41.10]Can't get those yet.
[154:41.94]There we go, this is what we're talking about.
[154:50.32]Get me growin'.
[154:51.18]Get me growin'.
[155:05.01]I can't pick up the merry-go-round.
[155:13.20]Halfway there.
[155:13.90]There we go.
[155:15.68]Alright, here it comes.
[155:19.25]This is what you came to the screen for.
[155:23.29]Nevermind.
[155:24.93]Nevermind, whatever.
[155:30.97]I can pick up the fences.
[155:33.71]I need to get 3.0.
[155:34.56]Can I pick up the people?
[155:35.50]I can.
[155:36.50]Can I pick up the bears?
[155:37.48]I can.
[155:42.62]I can't pick up the bunny.
[155:45.70]For some strange reason.
[155:48.24]He's too tall.
[155:49.04]What about the guy on the... Yep.
[155:53.07]There you go.
[155:57.27]Got him.
[155:57.51]Go get the bear stack.
[156:02.86]That's gonna have to be a final thing.
[156:04.74]Let me just make sure I get to three first.
[156:08.72]How is he still bigger than me?
[156:15.04]Boxes.
[156:23.60]There's a bear.
[156:25.86]Okay, where are they?
[156:26.72]There they are.
[156:27.10]Got him.
[156:30.50]I think I might have accidentally killed one, but I did get him.
[156:35.70]Alright, now I have to go get the guy doing the thing... The guy doing the thing down here.
[156:51.05]We will, eventually.
[156:54.01]Pick up the chicken sheep.
[157:00.20]Alright, let's get him.
[157:04.06]I can't pick him up!
[157:09.29]Guy on the... No, I can't pick up the lifeguard?
[157:11.83]What about these people?
[157:16.21]Yep.
[157:28.73]This would be... I think this is scarier than Godzilla.
[157:31.57]I really do.
[157:38.86]Because Godzilla is a huge scary monster and you know exactly what's going on.
[157:44.76]Alright, scary huge monster came out of the ocean and is just breathing fire on us and killing us, right?
[157:54.50]But this?
[157:57.20]You don't have an explanation for this one.
[157:59.73]And that's more terrifying.
[158:04.39]Like, I can explain King Kong to somebody if they ask me.
[158:09.07]I can't explain the Katamari, like, trash ball.
[158:18.86]Nice Katamari.
[158:19.72]Very airy and exciting.
[158:21.04]But now that you've come this far, let's do it even more.
[158:32.28]I think I should pick up the bushes now.
[158:34.44]Signs, trees, nothing is going to stop me now.
[158:40.50]It's a stupid light post.
[158:41.80]It's messing everything up.
[158:49.65]Keep going.
[158:50.89]I want to pick up a house.
[158:56.35]Can I get the boat now?
[158:59.68]Maybe this fence.
[159:01.86]Nice.
[159:02.18]Okay, that's gonna be a huge amount of girth here.
[159:05.51]Still have three minutes.
[159:16.09]Anything else?
[159:16.83]Can I get an island?
[159:17.67]Got the captain.
[159:25.80]At least I got the captain.
[159:26.56]Alright, back up into the town.
[159:32.40]Uh, just kidding.
[159:32.98]I mean, never go back to the town again.
[159:44.01]I can't pick up the trees!
[159:46.69]Oh, that's not cool.
[159:51.82]Let's just go this way.
[159:56.60]Lighthouse.
[160:13.64]Let me look.
[160:15.67]Back this way, maybe?
[160:23.21]There we are.
[160:23.79]You have one minute.
[160:29.39]Get it all.
[160:30.17]Everything.
[160:30.59]This is the best part of the game, and I hate that I only have a minute to enjoy it.
[160:44.67]Get bigger!
[160:45.25]Get all the cows!
[160:47.15]Another one of these guys.
[160:57.44]Nooo!
[161:01.22]What the fuck is happening over here?
[161:03.00]I just ruined, like, a gymnastics competition.
[161:11.05]I don't think I can get to five.
[161:13.66]No, I don't think so.
[161:19.50]4.78.
[161:19.52]There's a guy, there's a thief right there.
[161:25.72]4.8, ah.
[161:31.21]That's big enough.
[161:32.67]We have a piano lesson now, so we'll go back to space.
[161:36.33]Royal Rainbow Go.
[161:44.27]He actually won?
[161:44.99]Yeah, there's only one level where I spent more than an hour on, but... I'm in no rush, it's Katamari Damacy.
[161:55.19]You can do better.
[161:55.97]Well, since you're the prince, you should do much better.
[161:59.34]You did that fast.
[162:00.16]You hit the goal awfully fast.
[162:01.70]That was fantastic.
[162:02.94]That was so speedy and so smart.
[162:05.50]It will be a shooting star-like boon.
[162:07.28]The thing that you collect the most of is flowers.
[162:10.34]I think flowers is the most thing.
[162:13.67]Interesting, okay.
[162:19.89]Speedy and smart streamer.
[162:24.81]Floral.
[162:25.97]Well, that makes sense.
[162:28.54]Flower party.
[162:38.72]Ah, I saw it, I saw it.
[162:39.86]I saw the rocket.
[162:43.35]I can't talk during the cutscenes.
[162:45.47]It's not nice.
[162:50.35]It just wouldn't be right if I talked through the cutscene.
[163:13.96]Save complete.
[163:17.58]We must have unlocked some more.
[163:19.44]Any more, like, cousins?
[163:22.72]Yeah, but I want to be... I want to be this guy.
[163:27.61]Why am I not allowed to be that guy?
[163:37.65]That's not fun.
[163:42.61]Okay, make racy species!
[163:54.09]Dude, shroom laughing my ass off.
[163:57.05]Laughing my a- Why did I say that out loud?
[164:01.39]Uh, there's something missing.
[164:02.11]We have it.
[164:02.87]It's not fresh.
[164:04.36]The sky is spoiled already.
[164:06.26]It's not fresh at all.
[164:07.02]It's very ripe.
[164:08.04]This is not acceptable.
[164:09.80]Quickly, find some fresh fish on Earth.
[164:17.00]Rolling up fish.
[164:21.00]No, it's not right.
[164:22.10]It's fucking raw up here.
[164:27.03]Can't even cook a fucking scallop.
[164:33.06]Hurry Prince, this guy is looking a little tired, much like your eyes.
[164:38.31]And clouded like something you see on last week's fish.
[164:42.28]Feeling a bit more at home on Earth and starting to get a little complacent, are we?
[164:46.42]Getting a swelled head.
[164:48.68]Terrible.
[164:49.96]Get as many as you can and make as fishy a Katamari as you can for a beautiful Pisces for a super fab fresh sky.
[164:58.51]We order you to look at rolling with a fresh eye.
[165:01.43]Rediscover it.
[165:02.65]We plan to rediscover waiting around for six minutes.
[165:06.56]Perk up loser prince.
[165:12.19]Oh, I got a cat.
[165:18.68]I'm getting every fish.
[165:19.84]Look at all of them.
[165:23.74]Oh, this is so cool.
[165:28.88]Look at how many there are.
[165:35.04]So many fish over there.
[165:39.57]Get it.
[165:42.59]Are these sharks?
[165:43.43]Can I pick these guys up?
[165:46.21]Oh, they move around.
[165:47.30]Can I drown him?
[165:51.68]I gotta be bigger for that.
[165:53.72]Nah, I gotta know my battles.
[165:57.86]Yeah, know my battles.
[166:00.03]Because I can't run these guys down.
[166:11.00]Can't go this way.
[166:11.92]I need some more little fish.
[166:14.55]Maybe I should get the flowers.
[166:17.01]Flags?
[166:22.47]Can I pick up the flowers?
[166:24.63]No.
[166:25.27]It's just a texture on the ground.
[166:26.47]Too small for these?
[166:33.45]Yeah.
[166:34.69]Damn it, come on.
[166:35.71]I only have a few more minutes.
[166:39.46]I grow even one more meter, and this whole thing is mine.
[166:47.15]Oh, Stinger here, okay.
[166:58.87]Ugh.
[166:59.45]Skipped all the fish.
[167:00.25]I couldn't pick them up!
[167:01.93]They're in too awkward of a spot.
[167:06.67]They'd run away.
[167:08.96]Stingray is not a fish.
[167:10.04]I was actually going to ask that, but I felt scared that somebody, you know, people would be like, wow, you don't think Stingray's a fish.
[167:16.84]And I knew I was probably correct that Stingray is not a fish, but, you know, I didn't want it to get ridiculed for saying that.
[167:24.95]Who did this?
[167:25.39]Who flattened this thing?
[167:27.19]Like a pancake.
[167:30.63]I'm talking about, uh... Still not big enough for these.
[167:41.79]Can I get them yet?
[167:45.91]No, I gotta be much bigger.
[167:49.90]Why are there sand castles over here?
[167:53.60]Can I get the trash?
[167:55.76]I have to be so much larger than this.
[168:01.74]Just get out.
[168:04.00]You can't go under that, man.
[168:07.06]Who did this?
[168:10.06]I actually can't go up there.
[168:12.42]Why would... What the fuck, man?
[168:14.33]Alright, I'm not even going to attempt to do it again.
[168:15.83]I'm stuck on barbed wire, of all things.
[168:23.02]Still can't fucking get these.
[168:29.05]Any more random things I can pick up down here?
[168:36.09]What's with the monster truck?
[168:39.49]Fuck that, I'm not going that way.
[169:01.20]Get up there!
[169:01.92]Alright, I'm big enough to get these.
[169:06.84]That's what I was waiting for.
[169:16.93]I can't get these ones, though.
[169:19.59]I gotta go back up where a ton of them are over here.
[169:21.96]Penguins?
[169:22.36]Penguins are fish, right?
[169:25.52]No, they're not.
[169:26.08]A penguin is not a fish!
[169:30.73]Penguins are not fish.
[169:40.80]I thought it was gonna count them as fish for some reason.
[169:44.58]Alright, I got a bunch of those.
[169:45.42]I need to go to that area where they will all line around up there.
[169:50.48]Only have two minutes to get it.
[169:56.28]Where was that spot?
[170:00.72]There's that area with all the random ones just lying on the ground.
[170:03.72]It's like up here.
[170:08.80]There it is.
[170:12.52]We have a minute left.
[170:13.36]I think I can get on it.
[170:20.24]Back this way. 86.
[170:29.31]All right, just wait.
[170:29.91]They're right here.
[170:30.41]Just wait till they're gonna dive back over this way.
[170:32.21]Just get them.
[170:32.63]88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 94.
[170:34.32]I'm huge now.
[170:34.58]95, 96.
[170:34.62]I got plenty of time.
[170:53.88]And there's 100.
[170:54.46]101.
[170:56.02]Don't give me a weird number.
[171:01.27]120, 120, not 118.
[171:01.41]120, 120!
[171:01.45]No!
[171:24.98]Are you feeling livelier too?
[171:28.76]We'll take the fresh rainbow back.
[171:34.67]Uninstalled again.
[171:37.35]That's not even 70%.
[171:41.43]That's like a neighborhood fishing champ.
[171:44.37]Get out there and challenge yourself on the open sea.
[171:51.12]Forget the dinky neighborhood.
[171:52.68]You can do better, yes?
[171:53.82]You have more than this, yes?
[171:55.44]We'll force it into a constellation, but do it fresher next time.
[172:00.16]Alrighty, let's just release it into the sky.
[172:04.79]I will get every fish.
[172:05.61]I will get 68% of every fish.
[172:06.53]I can feel it.
[172:07.29]I can feel the cosmos.
[172:21.46]So fresh.
[172:22.06]I still have any new presents.
[172:23.58]Okay.
[172:45.81]Let's see what else we opened up.
[172:48.21]We got, make a star seven.
[172:51.61]Make Gemini.
[172:54.33]And I believe, uh, make Ursa Major.
[172:56.75]Uh, let's make Ursa Major.
[173:00.03]Let's make the bear.
[173:01.27]Ursa Major.
[173:08.38]It got away.
[173:09.86]To tell you the truth, I skipped it.
[173:11.38]Ursa Major, to be exact.
[173:16.43]A parent that leaves all the work to the child that looks bad.
[173:19.23]Deadbeat, yes.
[173:21.13]So we were finally done, and then... The last one gets away.
[173:26.97]Shoot, stupid bear.
[173:28.85]We are sick of it.
[173:30.32]So just roll me up one bear, and roll up the present, too.
[173:33.92]I just have to get one.
[173:43.73]This game teaches you that the constellations are made up of trash, fish, rats, and people in their houses.
[173:49.87]And movies, programs, and alligators.
[173:53.08]Bear family.
[173:54.02]Ooh, I smell a bear.
[173:57.04]Bad bears.
[173:57.82]Bad.
[173:58.94]Hurry up and start rolling.
[174:00.82]Just one.
[174:01.46]That's all we need.
[174:02.60]One bear.
[174:04.12]We're just missing one last bear.
[174:07.06]Give us the largest bear you can find.
[174:10.71]We'll be patient for 10 minutes.
[174:12.99]What the fuck?
[174:17.22]I don't remember those two guys doing this.
[174:20.42]Uh, leave your words.
[174:21.18]I need the biggest spear I can find.
[174:30.78]Uh...
[174:39.94]You got a bear.
[174:41.28]We can calm down now.
[174:42.53]What the?
[174:42.91]What is that?
[174:43.49]It's small.
[174:44.89]We didn't lose a small little bear like this.
[174:47.49]Fine.
[174:48.23]We'll somehow scrape up an Ursa Major from this, but next time get a much bigger bear rolled up.
[174:58.12]So you actually can't touch any bears.
[175:06.43]Holy shit, that's gonna be hard.
[175:13.70]How did I pass that, then?
[175:15.80]Strangely enough.
[175:25.25]On the bright side, that's the fastest I've ever completed a mission.
[175:28.87]Well, let's do it again.
[175:32.93]Where was Ursa Major?
[175:34.31]Okay.
[175:39.94]I know what to do now.
[175:46.12]We're also making a constellation Ursa Major.
[175:48.14]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[176:01.59]So, I'm already big enough where I can pick up most things already.
[176:05.82]Alright, so I need a big bear.
[176:15.37]That's a big bear right there, right?
[176:18.51]That bear is singing into a microphone, and people are watching.
[176:22.26]Why are those people stacked up?
[176:25.40]Stadium seating with benches.
[176:36.36]Alright, well, I'm going for that one.
[176:38.28]So I need to get a little bigger.
[176:40.76]Just make sure I don't run over any bears.
[176:46.18]I got 10 minutes, so I can just chill.
[176:49.20]That one's pretty big too.
[176:49.96]Is that a bear or is that a person in a bear costume?
[176:52.94]Does that count?
[177:04.69]Look at that bear!
[177:08.17]What the fuck has happened to humanity?!
[177:12.31]What time place is this?
[177:13.67]When does this take place?
[177:21.78]Okay, um... He's wasting ti- I'm- I'm just... Look, there are bears in the water.
[177:28.41]I just gotta- I gotta be slow about this, because I don't want to pick up anything accidentally.
[177:45.74]Bear?
[177:46.20]No.
[177:48.88]Champion fell.
[177:53.68]There's a bear in here.
[177:57.11]Don't touch that bear.
[177:58.47]The costume counts as a bear.
[178:01.27]So you're sure about that?
[178:19.48]Watch out, don't go so fast, I got a lot of time.
[178:26.77]Elephant is not a bear, but just walking around on the street... Holy shit!
[178:43.91]That's a bear.
[178:45.63]That's a very big bear, and it just tried to kill me.
[178:47.67]Okay.
[178:48.03]I'm gonna try to- Look at that bear!
[178:52.39]Look at all these bears!
[178:53.33]They're everywhere!
[178:53.99]That one's huge too!
[178:56.25]Floating around on balloons.
[179:03.63]What the fuck is going on in here?
[179:06.83]Why are they all just- What?
[179:08.17]A bear on a- What are they- What's he standing on?
[179:12.89]Just a ball.
[179:17.94]I'm playing baseball with watermelons.
[179:25.40]Slow down, slow down, slow down.
[179:27.48]I won't.
[179:27.72]I'll slow down.
[179:29.31]You're right, you're right.
[179:29.97]I gotta slow down.
[179:30.45]I don't wanna roll up any cubs.
[179:34.93]Okay, don't drop that bear on me.
[179:45.75]What?
[179:45.95]Where's the bear?
[179:46.47]Where?
[179:46.85]What?
[179:49.27]What bear?
[179:49.89]What bear?
[179:50.25]Where's the bear?
[179:51.05]What bear?
[179:57.71]That's a sign of a bear.
[180:03.09]That counts as a bear.
[180:04.49]A sign of a bear.
[180:10.46]What the hell?
[180:13.85]That's even smaller than the last one.
[180:16.41]But that's not a- I'll be right back.
[180:18.88]I'm gonna go- I'm gonna go take a piss and get water.
[181:12.69]Mmm!
[182:44.32]Alright.
[182:48.32]Why are you guys screaming?
[182:49.12]What?
[182:54.48]Is there a reason why everyone's yelling?
[183:02.57]Oh, the music.
[183:03.41]Alright, well, whatever.
[183:12.19]So snowy.
[183:12.71]What does that one look like?
[183:13.61]Explain it to me.
[183:19.23]Alright, we'll go back to that one later.
[183:20.37]Because I can't even roll up a sign of a bear.
[183:25.91]Make a star set.
[183:32.57]Do the bear.
[183:33.11]No, we'll go back to the bear later.
[183:35.97]What am I eating?
[183:37.95]A little, like, meal bar thing.
[183:43.86]Ever been to Poland?
[183:44.60]We go there often.
[183:45.94]Hope you can visit during the day's rolling.
[183:47.40]Mm-hmm.
[183:51.03]Stop being a boomer and download the plugin.
[183:57.79]Couldn't help but throw it towards Earth.
[184:00.65]We suppose it was too much to expect the dog to go fetch that far.
[184:04.68]Must be around somewhere.
[184:06.90]Okay.
[184:11.06]I'm not a boomer.
[184:13.32]If anything, I would be... I'm late millennial.
[184:18.15]No.
[184:19.75]Early millennial.
[184:23.99]That's not a boomer.
[184:24.91]A boomer is like 60.
[184:25.71]The Katamari should be 6 meters.
[184:32.72]That's pretty big.
[184:33.26]Alright, the next person that says boomer is getting a free.
[184:50.97]Oh, I fucked it up already.
[184:52.30]Bah.
[184:57.68]nah no banana turn the music up hold on just one little second there you go there's your music here it comes
[185:25.19]I have to get every banana.
[185:26.25]Why am I such a psycho?
[185:27.47]Just don't have to get every single banana.
[185:32.00]But I have to.
[185:32.62]I have to follow the trail.
[185:33.62]And it's so awkward to control going up.
[185:38.34]Don't say banana again.
[185:50.42]Do I get something for collecting all the bananas?
[185:54.49]Oh, I got them all.
[185:55.97]No, I didn't.
[185:56.43]How many more bananas?
[186:00.67]That has to be all of them.
[186:01.86]How about just a room of people and just animals all around the room?
[186:18.76]Axe.
[186:20.16]What was it?
[186:20.90]Six meters?
[186:21.74]I can get that.
[186:24.42]That's nothing.
[186:25.46]Let's go back up to... Well, I guess I have to go this way.
[186:45.01]Can I collect nuts all in one fish?
[186:49.34]More fruits, get them all.
[186:57.42]You can't even grow one meter in real life.
[187:02.42]Yeah, what do you mean, yes you can?
[187:04.48]It happens from age 8 to 15.
[187:14.44]Oh, you're talking about... Oh, you're saying I... And this is what happens when I look at the fucking chatroom.
[187:23.19]I look at the chatroom and somebody's calling me... Smaller than your average bear, you know what I mean?
[187:29.05]And I get stuck on a plate.
[187:32.91]What the hell are you... What's this guy doing in here?
[187:40.02]He's funny as watching TV.
[187:40.74]With a balloon and a cake, that's creepy.
[187:49.28]Not loud enough.
[187:53.45]Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up.
[187:55.21]I'm not gonna do it, nevermind.
[187:58.15]I was gonna say the F-O-R space W-H-A-2 question mark.
[188:02.34]I was gonna say it ironically, I was gonna say it ironically!
[188:20.77]Can I just get back to civilization?
[188:22.73]I'm wasting so much time down here.
[188:26.21]There we go.
[188:30.23]Chicken.
[188:33.15]Why does it take me to the countdown sound?
[188:46.32]There we go, there we go, there we go.
[188:50.44]Now we can get big.
[188:53.79]Follow the simple rules.
[188:55.17]Birthday cakes.
[188:57.39]Gasoline.
[188:58.13]Hey, birthday cake and gasoline.
[188:59.71]What a combination.
[189:01.59]I'm not going to turn it up.
[189:04.85]It's already very loud.
[189:07.25]Okay, now that's a trick.
[189:24.53]It's too- it is too loud.
[189:26.07]That's- people are just giving me shit.
[189:29.29]It's way too loud.
[189:30.35]I need to turn it down, if anything.
[189:42.04]Okay, who was just GTA-ing off the side there?
[189:44.44]Me, apparently.
[189:46.34]Alright, it sounds over.
[189:57.12]Not big enough to get these.
[189:58.30]Why?
[189:59.24]No, don't hit me with the duck boat!
[190:03.84]Almost!
[190:04.80]There it is.
[190:13.51]Stop sandwiching me.
[190:18.55]Alright, I can actually pick up people.
[190:19.63]That's good.
[190:23.77]I can... Don't touch the bear, right?
[190:34.33]I'm not seeing very many large objects to pick up, which is concerning me, just a little.
[190:40.68]There are a lot of people down here, though.
[190:47.12]Can I get the bikes?
[190:50.78]I can, but... Why are they circling these guys?
[191:01.06]Why are you so weird?
[191:05.59]Three penguins just watching the whole thing.
[191:07.67]Don't think I can pick these up, but I hope I can.
[191:10.74]Oh, I can pick the people up onward, but not the actual bikes themselves.
[191:13.76]Not big enough to open that door.
[191:17.68]Close to three.
[191:25.45]This is gonna be tough.
[191:31.43]Turn your voice down.
[191:39.15]Turn your voice down now.
[191:40.97]There are people sleeping.
[191:50.88]Alright, come on.
[191:51.76]Another level here.
[191:53.44]Come on, hurry up.
[192:00.52]Only five minutes.
[192:02.02]I gotta get so huge.
[192:04.52]I'm not even close.
[192:12.64]Not even close.
[192:13.76]I was gonna say, how could that be?
[192:21.98]Alright.
[192:23.56]Three meters.
[192:24.44]Still just a baby.
[192:25.64]There's a way through here.
[192:30.78]Alright, quickly.
[192:42.35]Start picking shit up.
[192:46.02]Turn it down.
[192:46.88]Alright, it's going down!
[192:51.82]It's too big to control.
[192:59.74]It's too big to control it!
[193:05.51]Ah!
[193:07.83]It's so big.
[193:09.99]I can't handle it.
[193:11.01]I really can't.
[193:13.47]I can't even pick up these bikes.
[193:15.37]Can I open these doors?
[193:17.71]Yes!
[193:18.45]Alright, new area.
[193:25.04]This might have just saved the whole area.
[193:26.50]The whole run, maybe, just been saved from this.
[193:36.44]I can grow another level here.
[193:39.96]That should be okay.
[193:40.80]4.4.
[193:46.46]Not enough.
[193:54.75]There it is.
[193:55.33]Alright.
[193:57.11]Come on.
[193:57.63]Exponential.
[193:58.63]Exponential growth.
[194:04.24]What else is out here?
[194:05.43]Can't get the cars yet.
[194:12.56]Back into the town.
[194:16.34]Huge rocks.
[194:17.14]Any more big rocks?
[194:33.23]5.3.
[194:33.41]This fucking music is gonna give me a nightmare.
[194:47.32]I can't get through that?
[194:49.48]Yes, I can.
[194:59.14]Only six.
[195:00.99]Not even six.
[195:06.17]I don't think there's gonna be enough time.
[195:07.55]No... Get over there, please.
[195:17.53]I can get cars now.
[195:19.22]I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, I can do it.
[195:22.42]I can do it, I can pick up cars.
[195:25.78]Tractor.
[195:27.38]I can't get the fucking tractor.
[195:31.56]Almost there.
[195:34.90]Got it.
[195:39.03]I thought it was eight.
[195:44.15]Not big enough to pick up the... I have way too much momentum though.
[195:48.57]There's no way I can actually control this anymore.
[195:51.37]I just have to let it go wherever it's gonna go.
[195:53.66]Not big enough to pick up a house.
[196:02.96]I can get almost everything else.
[196:10.44]Can I get up this way yet?
[196:16.26]Go!
[196:18.04]Can't get up that!
[196:19.72]Yes you can, yes you can!
[196:28.19]There's so much stuff here to get!
[196:29.71]I only have 40 seconds!
[196:44.30]At least get it to 7.
[196:44.86]There it is.
[196:45.66]7.7.
[196:45.96]7.2!
[196:46.12]No, can I get to 8?
[196:47.74]I'm stuck. 7.7.
[197:09.81]Maybe if I roll off, I can get the tractor?
[197:12.51]Nope.
[197:16.51]See you later.
[197:17.29]7.43.
[197:18.82]That feels so great.
[197:21.68]Is the audio out of sync?
[197:23.14]Let's test it.
[197:32.31]Did it just happen?
[197:43.26]Let's try.
[197:46.78]Most thing I collected was fruit, and then teenagers.
[197:50.00]Okay.
[198:02.71]Vitamins.
[198:32.62]Alright, let's test it.
[198:33.44]Ready?
[198:38.20]So I'm going to make noise when I move.
[198:40.04]It should be syncing up.
[198:43.63]Ready?
[198:44.65]What are you saying?
[198:46.67]Hold on.
[199:05.05]with this.
[199:12.67]Ready?
[199:14.73]One, two, three, four.
[199:16.73]One, two, three, four.
[199:18.66]Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[199:23.58]We got it?
[199:27.62]Alright.
[199:29.64]Okay.
[199:37.71]How much longer am I going to play for?
[199:38.89]I don't know.
[199:41.27]Maybe a few hours?
[199:42.05]A couple hours?
[199:43.21]We'll see when we get to, like, five or six hours in.
[199:47.74]Well, we'll see.
[199:53.87]Taurus.
[199:55.43]Star 8.
[199:57.47]Gemini.
[199:59.47]Hmm... Let's do the bull.
[200:09.33]Bear.
[200:12.66]We're also making a constellation.
[200:13.76]Taurus.
[200:16.52]Is this the same thing?
[200:17.44]You have to get one bull?
[200:21.26]Stupid cow.
[200:23.32]One cow.
[200:23.78]Fuck.
[200:31.83]Sorry, I'm like eating.
[200:33.53]I bought these specifically for streams.
[200:35.99]But sometimes I get real hungry.
[200:40.57]I'm one of those people that after like three or four hours of sitting in the same place, I have to eat.
[200:46.80]So I got these little bars that they're like protein meal replacements.
[200:50.40]They're actually pretty good.
[200:52.82]They're okay.
[200:57.30]It's a cookie flavor.
[201:00.80]We smell a cow!
[201:04.94]Always mooing noisy things.
[201:08.80]Hurry up and start rolling.
[201:09.94]Alright, hold on.
[201:14.84]I'm ready.
[201:17.87]One!
[201:20.77]Biggest cow you can find.
[201:21.87]Hmm.
[201:35.90]All right, there it is.
[201:37.64]That's what we have to get.
[201:39.66]That's the one we have to find.
[201:40.74]We have to pick up that one.
[201:45.73]Keep that one on your radar.
[201:46.61]Are these cooked chickens?
[201:54.03]All right, I actually am gonna be very careful here.
[201:57.81]No cow signs.
[201:58.67]If I pick up milk, does that count?
[202:00.73]It better not.
[202:09.70]That's not gonna count, is it?
[202:10.57]Taking my sweet time at this point.
[202:14.75]Don't hit the fucking car.
[202:17.03]The car phases through the barrels.
[202:35.06]Shit.
[202:35.64]What are you waiting in line for?
[202:37.76]What the hell?
[202:40.22]What are you doing?
[202:45.98]There's some big cows up here.
[202:47.94]A sheep is not a cow, right?
[202:57.15]It's not.
[202:57.91]But does the game think it is?
[203:03.19]Almost touched a cow.
[203:15.71]That was a cow sign, wasn't it?
[203:23.74]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[203:24.56]Where's the cow?
[203:25.28]Cow, cow, cow, cow, cow!
[203:26.36]Cow's coming!
[203:29.76]Don't touch the sign.
[203:30.94]This is minefield.
[203:32.34]I can't go through this.
[203:45.83]Okay.
[203:51.09]I'm so nervous right now.
[203:54.43]These are so difficult.
[203:55.63]It's so hard just to ram into things.
[203:57.19]It's so easy to ram into things.
[203:59.93]It's not hard.
[204:12.50]The trees in the way are really starting to give me like a panic attack.
[204:18.59]Okay.
[204:20.29]I need to get out of the trees.
[204:32.32]Head down this way.
[204:35.36]I can get people.
[204:41.46]Wait a minute!
[204:42.38]The couch fell out of the tree!
[204:44.99]Ugh.
[204:56.11]These are so hard!
[205:04.03]Outplayed.
[205:05.71]How was I supposed to know the cow was gonna fall out of the tree?
[205:17.75]Next time get a bigger one.
[205:21.27]I was being so careful too.
[205:22.76]What the hell.
[205:35.52]Not scouting.
[205:36.74]I didn't know that bumping into the tree was gonna drop cow coconuts.
[205:53.19]No presents either.
[205:54.01]What kind of Christmas is this?
[206:06.12]Star 8.
[206:08.10]Gemini.
[206:09.28]Okay, how is this gonna work?
[206:15.06]How can this be?
[206:15.58]There's something missing.
[206:17.21]Ah, yes.
[206:17.77]That's it.
[206:18.07]We get it now.
[206:18.91]It has no mystery.
[206:19.89]The sky has no mystery.
[206:22.17]It's so straightforward and easy to understand.
[206:23.99]That's important, of course, but just so boring.
[206:27.79]It'll tell you what's mysterious.
[206:29.71]Twins.
[206:31.45]What is with that connection?
[206:32.61]Is it telepathy?
[206:33.43]Do they have ESP?
[206:46.16]For God's sake, visit and switch cousins.
[206:49.65]I thought I couldn't do that unless it was multiplayer.
[206:53.33]You're talking about the mushroom, right?
[207:00.68]Is there a different spot to do that?
[207:04.78]Eek, identical, mind-bending, uncanny.
[207:09.08]Come to think of it, didn't you have a twin?
[207:12.00]A lot of them.
[207:13.86]At least, it's 62, I believe, is my number that I've been given.
[207:19.09]Really?
[207:19.43]So not true.
[207:20.17]Well, that's boring.
[207:20.93]No surprises there at all.
[207:23.33]Well, your deficiencies aside, get as many twins as you can and make as twin-packed a Katamari as you can.
[207:30.22]Twins.
[207:32.41]Super fab wonderful sky.
[207:33.73]I gotta pick up twins.
[207:36.13]Since it's all about the twins, you'll have 11 minutes.
[207:39.41]Devil of the usual.
[207:42.05]We'll look forward to the results.
[207:43.20]Solitary Prince.
[207:50.74]Twin boots, we see.
[207:52.00]Oh, it could be twin anything.
[208:00.04]How does the game determine that you picked up double of something if you pick up like a thousand of them?
[208:03.83]Frog.
[208:04.53]Give me the other frog.
[208:08.81]I didn't get the other bat?
[208:27.80]Alright, two dogs?
[208:29.00]Oh, look at all the bowling pins.
[208:34.48]Two, four, six, eight.
[208:47.32]Two birds!
[208:48.72]Got'em.
[208:50.84]I accidentally got them, okay.
[208:53.16]Twin pineapples.
[209:00.00]How is that not right?
[209:00.82]What?
[209:01.14]Get out of here.
[209:04.12]You just have to pick up everything.
[209:06.64]Apparently I didn't get flint.
[209:13.16]Fifteen.
[209:15.60]Sixteen.
[209:16.36]Don't fall off!
[209:18.86]Thank you.
[209:19.30]For listening.
[209:24.49]I don't think I'm big enough to get those animals.
[209:26.43]Let's go to the beach.
[209:36.85]Don't hit me.
[209:37.37]Yeah, whatever.
[209:43.85]How did you roll over?
[209:44.84]I rolled- I avoided it.
[209:46.08]I don't know what it is.
[209:50.18]That's not twins?
[209:51.00]I just got three.
[209:52.86]Oh, that's triplets.
[209:55.48]Not that it matters, right?
[210:00.46]Jellyfish aren't twins.
[210:05.29]Why is that?
[210:09.01]Turn your cam off.
[210:15.77]I just looked over to and I had a small panic attack.
[210:18.21]I don't know why.
[210:20.05]I did.
[210:20.55]Because I'm naked.
[210:26.01]I don't wear clothes.
[210:35.69]I just want to get over there.
[210:37.26]Get me up on the mountain thing.
[210:42.34]You're all going so fast!
[210:44.18]Stop going this fast!
[211:00.38]Oh, fuck!
[211:14.09]Birds.
[211:15.55]No twin pigeons.
[211:17.63]Hello, they're triplets!
[211:42.70]Uh, what, something wrong with that?
[211:49.73]Get this?
[211:52.31]What a blizzard.
[211:53.21]Say that about me!
[211:54.67]Plenty of bats here.
[211:56.75]Am I missing something?
[212:11.73]Cabbage.
[212:12.47]Cabbage.
[212:13.71]How is that not a twin?
[212:18.85]Carrot.
[212:20.03]Carrot.
[212:20.75]No.
[212:23.17]Get the cat.
[212:24.29]Cat's not a twin.
[212:34.43]No, the cat doesn't have a twin to eat, so... Look at all these telephone twins.
[212:45.34]That apparently doesn't count.
[212:46.34]Crab twins.
[212:46.68]Some are called older and younger.
[212:48.00]I see.
[212:48.20]Interesting.
[212:48.52]Can't get the rabbits.
[212:49.88]Got the two dogs.
[213:15.44]No, I didn't.
[213:19.24]Pick up the phone.
[213:22.04]Pick up the goddamn phone.
[213:31.23]Older brother, but it's not... they're not twins.
[213:37.21]Okay, those telephones are twins.
[213:47.05]Twin cats.
[213:52.21]Oh, now I understand why everybody was like, pick up cat.
[213:55.19]Pick up cat.
[213:58.33]I'm like, no, I don't even need to do that.
[214:00.72]Why would I do that?
[214:09.90]They don't have to be next to each other to be twins.
[214:12.56]I see.
[214:12.90]I get it.
[214:23.48]Frying pans?
[214:27.32]Go for the two pizza boxes.
[214:33.00]I can't even pick them up.
[214:33.88]Okay.
[214:35.97]Telephone?
[214:36.43]Let's go back to the beach.
[214:45.17]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[214:45.95]I see twins.
[214:46.53]These are actually twins.
[214:47.73]Right here.
[215:00.87]There are cows down here.
[215:05.66]Get all of them.
[215:07.00]Are these guys twins?
[215:08.40]No.
[215:09.46]Get out of the f***ing way.
[215:29.58]A Watermelon is stronger than a Carp.
[215:38.45]Forty... He's two.
[215:40.47]Forty-one.
[215:41.99]Still not big enough.
[215:46.50]I just killed the other one.
[215:49.80]There.
[215:51.70]Bear Twins?
[216:06.85]Streamer gets bullied by Watermelon.
[216:14.74]Can't pick it up.
[216:17.48]Can't pick these up.
[216:18.20]What about all of these people down here?
[216:19.30]These two mermaids?
[216:21.40]Twins?
[216:29.41]How did I get you, and not the other one?
[216:33.09]46.
[216:35.67]Down here?
[216:36.13]I got... another guy's rolling around.
[216:45.08]Still not big enough.
[216:47.14]No!
[216:47.40]None of you are directly related.
[216:57.86]that came out at the same time.
[217:02.23]Fire?
[217:05.23]Are you guys twins?
[217:13.03]Tuplets are not the same thing.
[217:17.14]There are twins here on twin bikes.
[217:20.80]Got it.
[217:28.64]Those guys don't count as twins.
[217:31.34]The one on the front is in charge.
[217:36.03]How does that make them not related?
[217:44.75]Skateboard.
[217:48.40]Come here.
[217:50.68]Just come here, I just need to- I need you for research!
[217:53.38]Just come here!
[217:55.32]Oh, fuck me.
[218:00.09]This guy playing golf, I can't even pick him up.
[218:10.31]I have to get to 50.
[218:11.16]Those guys are not twins.
[218:16.34]Can I get you guys now?
[218:17.56]Nope.
[218:19.28]Shit.
[218:20.18]Pawnee twins.
[218:28.49]Forty-nine.
[218:29.63]Fifty we got.
[218:35.80]Odd number incoming.
[218:37.18]Sucks.
[218:47.05]No, maybe not so fast!
[218:48.23]Odd number incoming!
[218:51.39]No, it's okay, I lost one.
[218:52.45]I feel better.
[218:55.62]It's still a mystery.
[218:56.76]Beyond comprehension, a thing of wonder.
[218:59.21]We'll take the mystery rainbow.
[219:07.25]It's hard to drink this like that.
[219:11.17]46%.
[219:11.35]I suck.
[219:13.87]The real mystery is how you manage to get so few.
[219:23.34]Oh, quite the critic, King of the Cosmos.
[219:29.33]That is actually an F. Just like clockwork, I look over here and just tease.
[219:47.09]All I see are tease.
[219:52.83]Alright, so somebody was saying, go do the cousins thing.
[219:56.84]But I can't select these guys.
[219:59.44]This is only for multiplayer.
[220:00.68]Another cousin has arrived.
[220:05.52]Okay.
[220:15.27]I wish I could just pick one.
[220:27.99]I want to be this guy.
[220:29.95]There's so many interesting characters.
[220:40.01]So, one guy said that.
[220:41.99]But that doesn't matter.
[220:43.43]It's still... I know.
[220:49.17]I know you could be them in some of the sequels.
[220:54.13]Names.
[220:55.15]Objects.
[220:55.71]Locations.
[220:56.47]Size chart.
[221:03.36]Somewhat large.
[221:04.38]That's funny.
[221:11.14]Press X to jump.
[221:14.37]No, you said press X to juke.
[221:20.33]Alright.
[221:21.49]What have we unlocked?
[221:23.37]Star 8.
[221:23.71]I think that's the last one here.
[221:28.52]It is.
[221:29.22]We have to do this one, Stunner Break.
[221:38.89]Literally just select one by pressing A, and then you can't do anything after that.
[221:44.19]After you select somebody, it just says, okay!
[221:46.47]Then it waits for another player to connect.
[221:49.32]Can't do it.
[221:53.62]You ever been to Russia?
[221:54.64]We were there yesterday.
[221:56.04]Hope you can visit.
[222:01.14]Yeah, we tried.
[222:01.62]A royal present for the hardworking prince.
[222:04.99]I've not picked up a present in two to three hours.
[222:15.41]We didn't bother to actually get one.
[222:16.80]But we're sure there's something down there.
[222:18.50]Something that looks like a present.
[222:20.30]It's Earth, after all.
[222:21.14]They have everything.
[222:21.84]Alright.
[222:26.76]Why is my chat... Whatever.
[222:28.24]I don't even...
[222:37.40]What am I supposed to say?
[222:38.64]I don't know.
[222:39.06]Uh-oh, rats.
[222:41.87]Today you'll be rolling around the town.
[222:44.51]The catamaran should be 12 meters.
[222:50.19]We can believe 18 minutes.
[222:52.28]This is a long one.
[222:53.46]This is a full raid boss, guys.
[222:55.84]I gotta be on my A game.
[222:59.86]Any longer?
[223:00.32]Yeah, all right.
[223:02.16]A game.
[223:09.93]I'm gonna bring the tryhard here.
[223:12.89]I'm not even kidding.
[223:13.91]You know?
[223:14.59]I'm not kidding around.
[223:15.21]I'm not even kidding.
[223:38.09]Smack crackers, cookie sandwiches.
[223:43.07]Level up already.
[223:45.69]Don't let it get to your head, don't let it get to your head.
[223:49.29]Just keep the fundamentals up.
[223:51.97]Roll, spin, roll, spin.
[223:53.80]Pick up the, pick up the clips.
[224:08.09]D-sync, we're hearing noises before he picks it up.
[224:12.93]Is that for real?
[224:17.19]You're hearing noises before I pick it up.
[224:25.80]How about now?
[224:39.12]Fixed?
[224:42.95]It was one guy.
[224:44.53]But I want to make sure that that one guy has a fun experience, you know what I'm saying?
[224:50.34]If that one guy goes, no, no, no, no, no, no, and then leaves, then I lost one guy.
[225:07.41]There may be 4,000 people here.
[225:09.01]Well, not anymore.
[225:09.81]I think I lost like 300 people when I talked about like shitting Starburst.
[225:14.47]I think I lost a few people there.
[225:17.76]But there are 4,001 of yous.
[225:18.94]You know what I'm saying?
[225:22.18]And it makes a collective 4,001 die, you know what I mean?
[225:30.71]Get the grilled cheese.
[225:42.53]Sure, yeah.
[225:46.63]How we doing?
[225:47.09]We're okay.
[225:49.53]Not great, but not bad either.
[225:57.29]Can I get the fence?
[225:58.59]Not quite, but I do need to go this way.
[226:04.23]Yo, so you have 200,000 followers.
[226:05.17]Where are they all?
[226:11.92]Where are all the people that have ever followed my stream?
[226:16.98]I don't know.
[226:22.91]Where are they?
[226:24.29]How dare those people have things to potentially do.
[226:28.21]They need to be here.
[226:32.11]Watch me roll up stuff.
[226:36.79]You guys are here.
[226:45.59]To be fair, I'm not even following.
[226:47.11]See?
[226:48.67]So then, yeah, that's all good.
[226:50.59]You don't have to follow the channel if you don't want to.
[226:58.02]But I mean, I'm only taking followers to Virtual Disney World, so...
[227:18.84]What was that noise?
[227:21.38]Uh, I rolled over something and it went... I don't know.
[227:27.52]This person's body.
[227:28.32]Get out of the way.
[227:29.58]Alright, don't lose it here.
[227:30.42]Come on, get up.
[227:32.70]Don't let this be the reason why this ends, because I got stuck over a fucking fence.
[227:35.71]Like, how does this happen?
[227:39.85]Why can I not just go back over this?
[227:43.36]Why?
[227:43.88]Why could I go over there in the first place?
[227:46.90]Why?
[227:54.93]I could go over it.
[227:55.77]I can't go back over it.
[227:58.83]Set an incline.
[227:59.65]Do I really have to restart this?
[228:01.07]Oh my god.
[228:21.07]I'm gonna start it off well.
[228:22.63]And I got stuck in this one tiny little place that I cannot get out of.
[228:36.39]Jesus mother of... Okay.
[228:47.64]Big enough to pick up the pigs.
[228:50.95]Alright, I gotta make this the last few minutes count.
[228:55.80]45, we're sure you can go further.
[228:57.46]I need to... I have to, otherwise I lose.
[229:02.16]Look at these huge trucks.
[229:05.14]This might have been a bad idea to go down this way.
[229:07.06]And how does he do it every time?
[229:28.37]I really need to be more than a leader right now.
[229:34.15]I can't pick these up either.
[229:35.85]I might be completely fucked right now.
[229:37.35]Yeah, I'm fucked.
[229:42.33]I don't think this is possible anymore.
[229:55.25]Everything here is way too big.
[230:02.65]Yeah.
[230:03.17]Game over, because I went down the hill.
[230:10.53]No, not yet.
[230:11.55]Don't say that yet.
[230:16.64]You can use your one reset.
[230:18.64]Why do I only get one reset?
[230:28.42]Fuck hell.
[230:30.52]One reset.
[230:33.86]Can I pick up the... nope.
[230:43.33]Hey, thanks lady.
[230:45.09]You really made this easy for me.
[230:47.13]Does that guy have a gun?
[230:59.66]Why is that guy holding a gun?
[231:02.74]Alright, I gotta get on these.
[231:13.32]This.
[231:19.36]Fireworks.
[231:21.16]No, it's not even worth doing this.
[231:22.23]These are too small.
[231:26.75]Ugh, my hands hurt.
[231:31.60]It's not about holding up and down on the analogs permanently.
[231:34.92]They're giving me, like, arthritis.
[231:49.15]I really am a boomer, man.
[231:50.37]My hands are, like, hurting.
[231:53.55]This is all too far... way too far in between.
[232:02.44]I was not supposed to come down here when I did.
[232:04.27]It's gonna be close, but I might still be able to do it.
[232:13.56]Let's chat every time.
[232:15.64]If there was some way I could let you guys collectively control this, I would.
[232:19.73]That'd be so funny.
[232:32.64]There we go.
[232:34.12]I also, after this level, like, I'm gonna grab the, uh, the actual controller thing that this thing, the little watermelon slices go into.
[232:44.81]We're holding these little ice cream sandwiches in either hand.
[232:48.22]I think it's part of the problem.
[233:03.77]Don't go in the water.
[233:05.75]Oh my fucking god.
[233:07.72]Please.
[233:08.80]Alright.
[233:15.22]Talking in riddles?
[233:16.06]No, I'm talking about the Switch controllers.
[233:20.74]I know the Switch is a great console, and it's so wonderful.
[233:23.08]There's a lot of great games on it.
[233:25.62]But if you don't have the pro controller, you can put your thumb over every single face button and be able to press them all at the same time.
[233:41.35]My thumb can cover every single button.
[233:49.18]I really just need to go get the actual controller.
[233:57.99]That's a little bigger, right?
[233:59.77]It's a huge alligator.
[234:00.65]All right, I gotta focus, focus, focus, focus, focus.
[234:09.93]Don't block my path here.
[234:10.99]I gotta go to the baseball game.
[234:12.47]No!
[234:15.29]I'm not supposed to be here.
[234:26.35]Alright, can I please pick these up now?
[234:29.52]Yes, good.
[234:36.06]Can't pick up people yet.
[234:40.58]I can't- I can fa- I can't- I can hurt them, but I can't pick them up.
[234:48.33]Okay, I guess- I stole a pizza from this lady, that's all I can do.
[235:02.05]I really don't know where to go.
[235:03.93]I'm in, like, the worst possible place to be in right now.
[235:07.54]Can I even make it back up here?
[235:15.10]Oh my god.
[235:17.88]Oh, I'm gonna scream.
[235:22.59]What is preventing me from going over here?
[235:24.91]This lip.
[235:25.65]That lip right there is what's... That's preventing me from going over!
[235:29.29]Ha ha!
[235:30.75]Why?
[235:31.37]Is that preventing me from going over?
[235:32.73]And somebody just died.
[235:35.89]Okay.
[235:44.50]He's peeking the mic.
[235:45.48]No, am I?
[235:45.70]Okay.
[235:57.22]Why couldn't I go with that lip?
[235:58.56]Why was I banned from going back where I was before?
[236:13.87]Please tell me that helps me here.
[236:18.29]Not really.
[236:34.91]Just pick up everything I can.
[236:36.21]Down every hall.
[236:40.43]Get the printers.
[236:47.36]There's so many corridors in this level.
[236:48.80]There's little tiny corridors everywhere.
[236:53.44]Just probably pick up the entire bench, right?
[236:57.20]Give me all of them.
[237:04.12]People are shooting at me now?
[237:05.26]Did I tell you this is scarier than Godzilla?
[237:12.22]This is scarier than King Kong.
[237:19.81]Go north.
[237:22.07]Which way is north?
[237:35.68]I missed the present, oh well.
[237:37.04]I need to beat this, this is a LONG level.
[237:42.11]The length of this one!
[237:43.05]Not that I'm gonna have to get the playground stuff.
[237:51.48]Did he get to 12?
[237:57.78]Here's the baseball game, but I don't want to go through the floor.
[238:06.00]Five beaters, finally!
[238:07.00]This one's not as big as we thought.
[238:08.73]Don't worry, I'm still working on it.
[238:25.37]Alright, go.
[238:26.41]Can I get cars?
[238:29.41]No, not yet.
[238:30.73]Shit.
[238:30.89]Can I pick up these?
[238:33.21]Why can't I pick up these cars and not the other one?
[238:36.43]That car is bigger than the one that's on the road right now.
[238:48.42]Gas station.
[238:55.99]Just getting stuck on everything.
[239:03.38]I'm too big for my own good.
[239:08.13]I'm too big, but not big enough to matter.
[239:17.59]Up here.
[239:18.01]All the stationary cars.
[239:19.05]Get them all.
[239:19.67]All of them.
[239:26.11]This is such a great place to be.
[239:27.69]If I could just get this construction equipment.
[239:33.34]Pick it up.
[239:33.86]Come on.
[239:34.58]I need this so bad.
[239:40.36]I'm almost there.
[239:45.16]Stop being so slow!
[239:58.50]Just go.
[239:59.42]Roll over the whole town now.
[240:04.76]You need that momentum.
[240:08.90]Now if I get up for a house...
[240:16.94]Oh my god, I don't even know where I am, I'm on top of the buildings.
[240:19.71]11.4, come on, get it!
[240:25.79]Get it!
[240:26.03]I don't even know what's happening anymore.
[240:36.14]I made it.
[240:36.50]16 minutes.
[240:45.66]All right, I'm getting houses for the first time ever Yes, it feels so good it feels fantastic All the build-up to pick up the monopoly houses
[241:20.18]17 meters, can I get 20?
[241:25.35]You have one minute left.
[241:26.59]There's another little area right here, come on.
[241:34.91]Run him over.
[241:40.51]Every person here is dead.
[241:44.75]Well, it's possible.
[241:48.95]But I don't know.
[241:51.27]20.
[241:51.81]Even bigger.
[241:54.45]Daleks is playing Super Smash Brothers.
[241:59.55]In case you were wondering.
[242:08.06]Now I'm in the clouds.
[242:09.14]Now I'm too big to even understand.
[242:11.22]And this is not even close to as big as you can get in my game.
[242:17.15]21.
[242:17.17]Like, what else is there for you to pick up?
[242:31.80]22, 46.
[242:37.48]Glad we got that one, though.
[242:40.65]It's pretty big.
[242:41.17]We imagined it would be a pretty good stone.
[242:43.55]If it were ours, we'd make it much bigger.
[242:46.85]The most thing you got was plants.
[242:48.05]Well, that makes sense.
[242:48.73]I'm running over dirt.
[242:59.46]Green!
[243:06.19]That's it?
[243:07.36]Space rockets are bigger and more beautiful than I thought.
[243:10.61]I want to be a space pilot too.
[243:13.45]Ho ho ho.
[243:14.51]Your father will be happy too.
[243:17.29]I wonder where your father is.
[243:36.93]I mean, that was disgusting.
[243:39.25]I'm trying to drink... A straw is supposed to go in this cup, but I don't have the straw, so I have to suck it out of the top.
[243:53.60]I have to drain... I have to bite into this like a snake.
[243:57.00]Virgo!
[243:59.50]Virgo, or... Let's make Virgo.
[244:06.79]You overfilled the drink?
[244:07.67]No, the drink has a lid on it.
[244:10.09]That a straw is supposed to go through, like, through the little hole.
[244:13.55]But I don't have the straw, and I don't have a straw.
[244:17.23]So I have to... I have to drain it through the top.
[244:20.94]It's lacking a certain something.
[244:22.58]Is it our royal present?
[244:23.62]No, that's not it.
[244:24.52]Oh, yes, we get it.
[244:26.02]Prettiness.
[244:26.56]The sky is not pretty at all.
[244:29.93]It's rough and masculine, possibly sweaty.
[244:33.60]What we want is pure girlish prettiness.
[244:37.64]There should be loads of maidens like those on Earth.
[244:46.31]Take the top off and drink it like a cup.
[245:00.92]Why didn't I do that?
[245:09.04]I could just take off the lid.
[245:16.94]But hold on, hold on.
[245:17.78]Let me give me... I have some defense here.
[245:22.50]I didn't touch anything.
[245:23.44]Somebody kicked me down the stairs.
[245:29.88]Okay, listen.
[245:32.19]A couple of days ago, I dumped a full entire coffee on my desk.
[245:36.73]16 ounces, didn't even take a sip.
[245:38.60]It dumped on the whole thing.
[245:39.56]It ruined this whole entire room.
[245:41.56]Took me like an hour and a half to clean it up.
[245:44.12]And I said, I will never, I'm going to close drinks.
[245:47.42]I don't want to knock anything over and have it spill, never again.
[245:50.46]So subconsciously, that's why I was doing this.
[245:53.68]Rat movie is about to hit a million views.
[245:57.91]That's quite an achievement.
[245:59.59]I never thought that would... I didn't even... It had that many to begin with.
[246:04.25]Took you an hour and a half to clean it up.
[246:05.55]Spencer, you have no idea, man.
[246:09.09]It was fucking ridiculous.
[246:12.03]The earth is full of maidens.
[246:14.69]This is another lucky day for the prince.
[246:17.97]Roll up as many as you can and make as maiden-rich a catamaran as you can.
[246:24.84]Super fab pretty sky.
[246:26.32]Most Earth maidens are easily bored.
[246:29.52]So you only have 11 minutes.
[246:31.86]We look forward to it, Frisky Prince.
[246:34.20]Okay.
[246:39.85]11 minutes.
[246:40.31]How have I already... Oh, it's the dolls.
[246:49.03]It's a trail of dolls.
[246:56.20]I need to change that.
[247:00.29]I'd rather just shake the controls.
[247:04.33]Hold on a minute.
[247:05.75]Can I do that from here?
[247:07.69]No.
[247:20.48]Going up, down, up, down, up, down on the joysticks is kind of a pain in the ass.
[247:25.04]I'd rather just do the... I'd rather just shake the Wiimote.
[247:35.67]I'm just... literally... a cop.
[247:37.49]What is this laugh?
[247:39.47]What is this laugh?
[248:06.17]Is this the whole area?
[248:08.63]It's the pool over there.
[248:11.60]There's a lady with a cat coming out of her stomach.
[248:13.40]I need to go into the pool, but I need to be bigger than this.
[248:19.54]I can't take anything.
[248:22.98]Is this supposed to be like a school?
[248:26.08]I don't understand.
[248:27.64]Like a field trip?
[248:29.33]I have no idea.
[248:44.17]Outdoor school.
[248:48.44]There was a door, but no walls and roof.
[248:50.50]It was very odd.
[248:54.12]Can I pick any of this stuff up?
[249:01.30]No.
[249:01.54]I feel like I may have missed a lot of things in the beginning.
[249:13.92]Or I can actually... Bear carving... Go this way.
[249:27.43]No.
[249:28.47]I should get it in a second here.
[249:33.73]There we go, okay.
[249:53.77]I have reached the level of largeness that I need to pick people up.
[249:59.30]At least for the most part.
[250:17.29]We could pick them up.
[250:17.93]No, I couldn't.
[250:19.21]I ran right into them last time.
[250:21.39]Remember I went through there and I bumped into the desk and the person on the desk?
[250:27.12]Whoa, a present!
[250:29.18]A present.
[250:30.66]Okay, I need to remember where this is.
[250:32.74]Because when I get big enough to collect that present, I want to come back.
[250:48.32]All right, I got a feeling up there... Sliding door?
[250:55.58]Why are there so many sliding doors up here?
[251:01.09]All right, over to the wrestling ring.
[251:14.06]Not quite large enough.
[251:22.77]Alright.
[251:26.79]Is that really gonna block me?
[251:28.21]That one tiny little thing in the way?
[251:29.69]I need a hundred.
[251:38.97]Thought we could get it for the present, right?
[251:46.05]Not yet.
[251:47.23]Although I might be able to reach it from here.
[251:50.73]Shit, not quite.
[251:51.45]Come on, no.
[251:51.85]Dammit.
[252:04.11]Two meter tall.
[252:10.35]Why are there so many camera crews down here?
[252:17.39]Is there everybody- is everybody filming a TV show in this town?
[252:25.89]I don't know what I just picked up.
[252:36.30]It's the Truman Show.
[252:45.45]Get present.
[252:46.14]Get present.
[252:46.54]I'll get it.
[252:48.76]That person's filming this person playing the piano on the back of a truck.
[253:06.71]Is this re-roll?
[253:07.33]This is re-roll.
[253:10.89]This is re-roll.
[253:11.95]All right, where was the... there had to have been a lot more.
[253:18.78]I feel like I'm missing a lot of people.
[253:22.77]In six.
[253:24.35]Can't hold the camera for a second here.
[253:43.04]Still can't make it in here.
[253:47.30]Oh yeah, I can.
[253:57.14]90, 91... 93, 94... Look at chat.
[254:00.65]Look at chat.
[254:02.27]What do you mean, what, what, what, what?
[254:03.71]What's going on?
[254:04.15]What happened?
[254:04.45]What, what, what, what?
[254:04.99]What?
[254:05.17]What's the matter?
[254:09.81]Dropped the present.
[254:10.65]What do you mean I dropped the present?
[254:14.62]What are you talking about?
[254:15.54]Where?
[254:15.92]Where did I drop it?
[254:18.56]What?
[254:20.96]Where is it?
[254:25.76]Holy shit, there's a lot of people here.
[254:38.81]It's in the water.
[254:39.81]Water, water, water, water, water, water.
[254:41.49]Hold on, hold on.
[254:41.95]Alright, alright, alright.
[254:43.05]I'll get it.
[254:49.70]Okay, where in the water?
[255:02.99]What do you mean, water burger?
[255:07.59]I didn't drop the present.
[255:24.03]Umbrella.
[255:28.50]Wait, why did it fall off?
[255:31.28]Why did it fall off in the first place?
[255:35.54]Royal present.
[255:36.26]Okay, I have it now. 120.
[256:01.71]Back, back, what do you mean back?
[256:03.59]What are you talking about?
[256:04.71]What?
[256:05.21]Why is it on the ground over here?
[256:21.10]Can this thing stay on now, please?
[256:24.16]No, it fell off again.
[256:28.97]Alright, I'm just not gonna do anything for two minutes.
[256:31.05]The present's more important to me than getting a high score.
[256:37.20]We have one minute left.
[256:40.56]Present's still on?
[256:41.30]It is.
[256:45.38]Alright.
[256:51.31]Uh, Bomb Booth has a few more people.
[256:57.66]Please tell me if that present drops again.
[257:10.33]Chat can breathe.
[257:12.37]Did it fall?
[257:13.17]No, I see it.
[257:13.75]It's still there.
[257:16.69]I'm going to take my hands off the controller.
[257:21.84]There's tons of people here.
[257:26.65]Wrestling ring.
[257:27.63]Last attempt.
[257:28.63]Straight in.
[257:29.03]Nope.
[257:32.80]Not big enough.
[257:36.56]Need a number on the... We must hurry, or the maidens will be bored.
[257:48.44]Quickly, quickly.
[257:49.24]Go, go, go.
[257:57.03]Is that all there is?
[257:57.75]65%.
[257:57.77]131 maidens.
[258:02.08]It's not that many, and it's not that few.
[258:05.90]As far as maidens go, these are about average, too.
[258:08.32]Gee, what?
[258:10.16]Get out there and risk it more.
[258:11.84]What the hell is going on?
[258:13.14]Next time we want a plethora.
[258:16.44]And I got the royal present.
[258:22.29]It's a t-shirt.
[258:30.27]Do I get to wear the t-shirt too?
[258:31.69]Or do I just... I don't get it.
[258:38.49]Take it easy up, Quark.
[258:39.62]Thanks for sticking around.
[258:41.26]Yeah, a lot of you guys have finals, don't you?
[258:44.42]I keep seeing the finals.
[258:57.01]Stop saying finals.
[259:00.45]How do you pronounce plethora?
[259:01.93]A plethora.
[259:11.08]End of stream voice?
[259:12.02]What?
[259:12.22]I'm not ending the stream.
[259:13.28]What are you talking about?
[259:14.20]End of the stream?
[259:14.96]No.
[259:16.56]Can we only stream for like four hours?
[259:21.23]Don't you know New Germa doesn't stream for like three and a half hours anymore?
[259:28.07]Vegas Jerma streams for like six to seven hours.
[259:30.59]Alright, let's keep going.
[259:49.22]I want Boston Jerma back.
[259:53.93]There's nothing wrong with Boston Jerma.
[259:57.38]But Vegas Jerma streams for longer.
[260:04.11]Is this the only thing on the menu here?
[260:07.51]I believe so.
[260:10.87]Star 9.
[260:16.73]Change goal!
[260:17.61]Thank you for reminding me.
[260:19.17]I gotta get the controller.
[260:20.05]I'll be right back.
[260:21.49]Just gonna go get the little thing that you slide the controllers into.
[260:25.61]It'll take me like 30 seconds.
[260:28.64]done done
[260:54.83]Alright, we're back.
[260:55.95]Let me just slide these... I didn't even- I didn't pee.
[260:59.61]I got that little carrying thing.
[261:26.19]You can hear the satisfying clicks.
[261:30.64]Alright.
[261:31.54]That's in.
[261:32.04]And now I actually have a place to put my fingers.
[261:34.22]That was a problem.
[261:37.90]Holding those little wedges.
[261:39.14]Ugh.
[261:41.51]Just nowhere for all your index fingers to go.
[261:45.07]That feels better.
[261:49.49]You ever been to Mongolia?
[261:50.87]We were there yesterday.
[261:51.87]Mm-hmm.
[261:55.31]There's a present down here as well.
[262:00.69]All right, roll it up.
[262:05.87]All of your multiple index fingers.
[262:12.60]Yeah, your hand is index finger, index, index, index, thumb.
[262:17.02]You have four index fingers.
[262:26.48]Today you'll be rolling around the world.
[262:28.02]The Katamari should be 30... 30 meters.
[262:35.16]That is more than twice what it was supposed to be last time.
[262:40.59]20 minutes.
[262:45.57]Here we go.
[262:52.81]Alright.
[262:54.07]30, 20 minutes, let's go.
[262:57.92]Big bunce.
[263:05.48]I can't pick up those fucking heat lamps.
[263:14.44]I am very small.
[263:30.35]I can't spend very much time.
[263:31.35]I really have to just kind of pick up as much as I can.
[263:32.81]Are those sausages?
[263:35.65]I love the little mini hot dogs.
[263:36.85]When was the last time you guys had a mini hot dog?
[263:39.45]Do you think?
[263:39.77]Yesterday?
[263:56.33]I don't know if I believe you.
[264:00.19]Down here, telephones.
[264:03.88]Lots of telephones.
[264:04.86]I'm gonna make a pass back.
[264:15.95]It's like mowing the lawn, guys.
[264:16.79]You don't get the whole lawn mode in the first go-through.
[264:36.87]These ones move around, I can just stay kind of in this... No, come on.
[264:49.38]You don't mow the whole lawn in a single.
[264:50.86]You don't mow the whole lawn.
[264:58.85]Alright, we can move on.
[265:02.33]Can't get them all.
[265:05.06]That's what we needed.
[265:06.82]Got it.
[265:07.36]Got it early, too.
[265:22.69]That first level up is the most important thing.
[265:27.87]You gotta get that early, otherwise he's gonna do what I did up to four and just get stuck in a fucking wall somewhere.
[265:38.78]Let's go back to where we were in the beginning.
[265:42.54]Up here.
[265:44.50]I see that clip.
[265:46.80]You think I can't see that?
[266:00.97]It pops up in the chatroom.
[266:02.47]I can see it.
[266:05.13]Every clip you make, I see it.
[266:06.63]I actually got somebody.
[266:17.84]Tell me this is a fucking idiot in the bear costume.
[266:20.61]This Fazbear pizza fucking idiot.
[266:26.52]I don't think it was possible to even do what I just did.
[266:37.64]Piece of idiot.
[266:40.24]Roast on a bone, that sounds pretty good.
[266:57.13]Alright, Freddy.
[266:58.75]Back to, like, your seventh game.
[267:10.74]Can't pick you up?
[267:17.13]Why isn't Freddy Fazbear in the Smash Bros.?
[267:19.05]That's what I want to know.
[267:25.12]I'm gonna do my best attempt to remember what the names of the Freddy Fazbear Pizzeria people are.
[267:31.32]Freddy.
[267:31.60]I mean, that's his name.
[267:33.06]It's like that's not known as Mario.
[267:34.97]His name's on the fucking cover.
[267:38.87]Uh... Chicky.
[267:43.35]Bun Bun.
[267:47.70]Rocko.
[267:51.10]Foxy.
[267:59.44]And... Mecha Bunny.
[268:09.94]It's like a Mecha Bunny, right?
[268:19.30]And there's the Balloon Kid.
[268:22.30]And there's the other wolf thing.
[268:26.79]Alright, I'm just going back and forth over and over again.
[268:28.65]Fucking get over it.
[268:32.49]Why would you put watermelons in a boat like this?
[268:42.28]I need to see the map.
[268:44.04]I can't see anything.
[268:47.04]What about Sans?
[268:51.68]Um... Sans is not in Five Nights at Freddy's.
[268:59.36]So here's my prediction, you wanna hear what I have to say about Five Nights at Freddy's?
[269:03.36]I will bet any amount of money, I'm talking like ten bucks, five bucks, up to even like fifteen bucks, that Five Nights at Freddy's is gonna get the Slender Man treatment.
[269:17.05]And like five years from now there's gonna be a Five Nights at Freddy's movie.
[269:19.97]And it's gonna get 17% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[269:32.97]Oh, for the love of God.
[269:33.95]I just have to get stuck in every object.
[269:41.19]I still can't pick up the guy and his, like, ten suns on his head.
[269:44.26]It's gotta be exactly 17 or I lose.
[269:49.06]That's fine.
[269:58.23]Three meters, still a baby.
[270:02.56]Long way to go, alright.
[270:04.26]How big am I now?
[270:07.06]They already did it, but they threw out the first script?
[270:09.40]Yeah, it's gonna take them decades to figure out what to do.
[270:23.88]All I know is it had better start with... Oh, hello!
[270:27.36]Oh, hello, hello!
[270:29.75]If that doesn't- If that's not the first ten minutes of the movie, I'm going to walk out of the fucking theater.
[270:41.96]Can't really go that way anymore.
[270:48.50]This dude still can't be picked up.
[270:58.02]The question is, where the fuck am I supposed to even go right now?
[271:00.64]I need to get back up there.
[271:03.91]I gotta go back up this way somehow.
[271:07.93]Back up on the street.
[271:09.61]Can I even get over here?
[271:17.34]How do I get up there?
[271:22.82]I came all the way down and I just don't know how to get up.
[271:28.68]There we go.
[271:34.82]Let's go!
[271:42.99]Am I on my back here?
[271:45.71]Um... Because... How do I get over there?
[271:51.57]Is there one way for me to get up there?
[271:58.84]Where the hell is it?
[272:01.74]Down this way?
[272:02.48]What the fuck?
[272:03.18]I'm not big enough to roll over this way.
[272:20.37]And what fucking messed up reality are you talking about there?
[272:26.39]What reality is this?
[272:37.54]Okay, thank God.
[272:45.25]Problem though.
[272:49.69]How am I gonna fit through that?
[272:50.74]Uh-oh.
[272:54.28]Uh-oh.
[272:56.06]Oh, that's... Thank God I'm not five meters bigger.
[273:02.59]This is where it starts.
[273:08.28]Something's seriously wrong with this building.
[273:11.84]Trees?
[273:12.36]No, I can't get the trees yet, shit.
[273:14.18]Six, seven!
[273:33.92]No Plague Run equipment.
[273:34.96]Nice, good time to beep.
[273:37.02]Alright, what about this way?
[273:38.44]Is there anything up here?
[273:50.33]Kind of.
[274:03.98]So much of bulls.
[274:05.40]This might have been a bad idea, but I could probably get the fence.
[274:08.02]Yeah, I can.
[274:08.48]Good.
[274:11.27]Fence adds a lot of height.
[274:13.85]Can I get you bulls?
[274:30.10]Okay, I got it.
[274:31.76]I can pick up the bulls.
[274:33.24]Am I big enough to take down the whole barn?
[274:35.44]No.
[274:35.56]Ugh.
[274:35.68]I gotta get down there again.
[274:39.36]Let's go right off the edge.
[274:42.25]Momentum, and... Oh.
[274:54.31]Alright, well, like apparently that didn't want to work.
[275:01.34]Don't ask me why.
[275:05.64]I try.
[275:09.08]Trees yet?
[275:16.89]Why are these cars driving around in parking lots?
[275:21.13]Is this like a driving test?
[275:29.13]Alright, where from here though?
[275:33.17]Over there?
[275:34.03]All the mushrooms?
[275:34.79]Alright, I'm going that way.
[275:36.09]Wait, I don't think I can even get in there.
[275:42.86]I don't think I can roll in there yet.
[275:56.05]Oh, it's so awkward to control.
[275:58.45]It's too big.
[275:59.01]Fuck!
[276:21.86]How are you supposed to hit the brakes on that?
[276:24.72]Where am I going right now?
[276:26.19]Did I ruin everything by trying to do the dumb jump when nothing is even over there?
[276:30.75]There's nothing even over there worth picking up.
[276:39.84]There's a handful of solar panels.
[276:43.22]I've just lost weight doing what I did.
[276:53.33]What is coming?
[276:53.73]What?
[276:55.52]Alright.
[276:59.42]Trees are now able to be picked up.
[277:02.76]At least the smaller ones.
[277:03.72]That's good, because that's how I'm going to get the height necessary to keep going.
[277:06.26]I only have six minutes left.
[277:10.55]Good.
[277:18.45]Still in diapers.
[277:20.47]Says you.
[277:21.15]Alright, exponential, let's go.
[277:24.25]How am I supposed to get over there?
[277:27.41]What?
[277:27.77]Oh my god, I can't even see.
[277:31.71]I'm not gonna be able to do this.
[277:59.42]Hold on.
[278:00.02]Slow down.
[278:00.82]What's that?
[278:01.24]What's that over there?
[278:01.82]I don't have time for this.
[278:04.02]I don't have time to do this.
[278:04.78]No!
[278:35.06]Well, we're going this way.
[278:49.67]Who cares about that?
[278:50.91]It's just a dumb little gamer achievement.
[278:53.27]I don't care about gamer achievements.
[278:55.52]I want to beat the level.
[279:05.94]Am I even going right now?
[279:07.44]It's a lot like a power plant.
[279:12.76]This seems like a good place to get some weight.
[279:16.36]It sure is.
[279:17.18]All right, there's apparently a big battle going on.
[279:30.64]What do we need?
[279:32.94]20?
[279:32.96]No, it's 30.
[279:36.78]Nice, okay.
[279:39.82]Can I get the cylinders up here?
[279:45.16]Nope, not yet.
[279:45.64]I gotta go back.
[279:51.60]All the tractors are here.
[279:53.42]And all these freight containers.
[280:03.63]I can't pick those up.
[280:04.45]What?
[280:08.82]20.
[280:08.94]Ay.
[280:09.16]There's one- there's a random giraffe over here.
[280:17.96]There we go, trees.
[280:24.75]Can't pick up the whole circus yet.
[280:27.41]Here are the mushrooms I wanted.
[280:37.85]This is gonna be fucking close.
[280:45.79]Houses.
[280:46.21]I need them.
[280:49.88]Come on!
[280:50.52]I need more!
[280:54.16]Twenty-four!
[280:57.98]Twenty-five!
[281:02.22]Twenty-six!
[281:06.95]Switch it!
[281:07.53]Come on!
[281:10.67]Oh no!
[281:13.97]Get the barn!
[281:14.73]The silo!
[281:24.94]Two minutes!
[281:26.62]I should get it.
[281:27.20]Unless something really, really bad happens. 29.
[281:36.91]Um, tree's up here.
[281:38.55]Yeah, I got it.
[281:42.34]You get stuck here.
[281:47.08]Oh, getting stuck.
[281:50.30]You cannot be serious right now.
[281:55.99]Just slow down, hit the brakes.
[282:15.26]Nice Katamaru.
[282:16.33]You did it.
[282:21.97]Go somewhere else?
[282:24.89]I'm fine.
[282:25.51]Remember that lighthouse?
[282:28.96]It's mine.
[282:31.50]Giant fish.
[282:34.26]Got it.
[282:34.66]Swordfish.
[282:39.63]Take it all.
[282:41.64]Get it!
[282:43.12]Yeah, I stole your spitball, too.
[282:47.38]Present?
[282:49.64]Present on the island, I think.
[282:53.68]Nope.
[282:53.96]Whatever, get some boats.
[283:05.22]And the giant squid.
[283:06.22]Come on.
[283:06.48]I need to get it all.
[283:08.46]Nice.
[283:19.49]Come on.
[283:19.87]Get up here.
[283:20.33]Get like a bunch of shit quick.
[283:25.27]More.
[283:25.67]More.
[283:26.01]More.
[283:27.05]I need more.
[283:27.69]Alright.
[283:33.78]Is there a mode with no timer?
[283:36.14]I believe there is.
[283:38.92]Alright, stop what you're doing.
[283:40.92]We have plans to get together with your cousins, so we'll go back to space.
[283:50.65]If I'm not mistaken, I think you can actually roll up the entire wheel.
[283:58.97]First goal, but it's not very exciting, is it?
[284:01.55]We want a bigger one next time.
[284:06.08]The plants?
[284:06.82]How is luggage in third place after picking up houses?
[284:20.83]The whole universe, man.
[284:26.09]Stop!
[284:27.67]Stop!
[284:29.49]Oh, isn't that Dad running over there?
[284:30.89]Dad!
[284:33.99]The moon is gone.
[284:35.51]Can I get a new present?
[284:37.33]No, I'm already wearing it.
[285:07.39]Why do you need a telescope for that?
[285:13.67]Oh, change the spin move, right.
[285:16.75]I need, like, game controls.
[285:21.97]Sound.
[285:23.01]Constellations.
[285:23.64]Control type.
[285:27.28]Control type.
[285:28.70]Motion controls.
[285:37.93]Okay.
[285:40.73]I don't want to play with the motion controller.
[285:44.07]I just... Controls check.
[285:50.08]So this is... Okay, this is motion controls.
[285:55.30]No thanks.
[285:56.60]I just want that bottom left one.
[285:57.96]That's all I want.
[286:08.18]What does simple, simple are?
[286:12.94]Ooh, charge and roll, look at that.
[286:18.63]Quick turn is... okay, hold on, this might be better.
[286:26.72]I'm using tilt control.
[286:29.88]No, I, I, the usual controls I like, because essentially it's like you pretend you have two hands on the ball.
[286:37.74]So your thumbs are your two hands and you have to do the motion that with your hands is what would be like in real life.
[286:43.85]You want to spin the ball to the left?
[286:45.67]You hold off on the right one, you spin with your, you know, your left hand.
[286:48.77]You push with your left hand.
[286:49.69]That charging roll is the only thing that sucks on here.
[286:57.25]Yeah, the jump is the, it's not the, uh, it's the prince.
[286:59.99]You just jump in the air and look down.
[287:02.37]Well, I guess we can't really change it.
[287:05.09]So, that's alright.
[287:11.87]Make the moon is what is remaining.
[287:17.95]I don't think there's any else.
[287:22.38]Yeah, that's it.
[287:25.00]Make the moon.
[287:25.48]I'm using shit controls.
[287:26.88]What are you talking about?
[287:32.79]Uh, do you know Esperanto?
[287:35.23]Maybe we'll invent a cosmic Esperanto.
[287:37.67]Oh yes, almost forgot.
[287:39.39]Oh yes.
[287:40.43]A royal present for the hardworking prince.
[287:42.05]But we felt bashful about handing it to you, so we left it on Earth.
[287:46.31]You can roll it up when you're making the moon.
[287:56.87]Movies, programs, elephants, giraffes.
[287:58.31]The whole thing.
[288:04.90]Today, you'll be rolling around the world.
[288:06.40]The Katamari should be, let's see, around 300 meters.
[288:12.52]300.
[288:15.16]You have 25 minutes.
[288:20.76]300.
[288:22.86]Okay.
[288:26.20]Here we go.
[288:29.96]And it's the song.
[288:31.78]And it's the song.
[288:34.97]Oh, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops.
[288:36.35]Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.
[288:39.07]I went the wrong way.
[288:42.33]What?
[288:42.43]All right, here it comes.
[288:57.73]Is he scumming?
[288:58.61]Oh, come on.
[288:59.47]I don't... I have... This is a 25-minute encounter.
[289:07.13]Every second counts here.
[289:08.47]Not... Oh, whatever.
[289:09.53]I fell off the earth and it's going to be five minutes to get up there.
[289:11.77]Don't worry.
[289:17.59]The song will play again.
[289:22.82]You just killed them all right there.
[289:26.98]It's gonna be fine, though.
[289:30.52]And... here we go.
[289:31.64]You know, I tried to learn how to play this on the drums.
[289:38.59]Did I tell you that before?
[289:40.99]I used to play the drums, and I wanted to learn how to play this exact beat here.
[289:44.49]And I did it.
[289:53.06]Alright, perfect score here.
[289:54.26]I gotta get the giant squid to end the game.
[290:00.79]Up here.
[290:12.60]Dude, I should put this song on my gym playlist.
[290:15.60]It's that inspiring.
[290:43.12]I can't fuck with the momentum of the song.
[290:48.13]They're doing it too.
[290:49.13]And they're better than me.
[290:55.41]This good set music, what are you talking about?
[291:01.51]What?
[291:01.73]Why?
[291:01.99]Ugh.
[291:20.24]Get him all, oh yeah.
[291:27.81]Oh, just barely.
[291:35.35]All the cows.
[291:58.32]I'm gonna back up to the Civilization here.
[292:08.28]My way!
[292:14.31]That's a pretty good start.
[292:21.07]That's a free move.
[292:29.51]I'm not trying to itch my neck at the same time.
[292:44.07]I just made like a fart with my neck.
[292:50.30]Did anybody hear that?
[292:58.63]What is happening with this?
[292:59.99]Why is people copy-pasting?
[293:05.26]I think it's hilarious.
[293:07.06]And you got some tough shit to me.
[293:13.52]Right here.
[293:14.40]I'll go.
[293:14.70]It's cool.
[293:17.70]Good.
[293:18.00]Level up.
[293:20.89]Still just a baby.
[293:29.20]Back it up.
[293:30.48]Come on, why would there be a school on an incline?
[293:54.96]Can't be here.
[293:57.08]Alright, gotta move on.
[294:12.83]Next area.
[294:19.66]Wait, not quite.
[294:22.71]Can I get these trees yet?
[294:24.23]Fuck.
[294:25.89]Alright, we're gonna go from here, this way.
[294:36.49]So far, so good.
[294:38.09]Back out here.
[294:44.38]Any more ice creams?
[294:50.11]Okay, I picked that up.
[294:52.05]I gotta go back around.
[294:52.75]I gotta get back to the actual place, the starting area, where I was before.
[294:57.59]This way, right?
[295:04.16]Maybe not.
[295:04.40]How do I get back up here?
[295:08.56]On this hill?
[295:14.87]Get the Optimus, I can't get him yet.
[295:20.09]Am I gonna have to get this shit in here now?
[295:27.24]No, I'm not.
[295:30.32]Let's hit Battle Royale for this.
[295:31.54]Seems like I'm stuck in this one spot.
[295:34.76]How do I get out of this little quadrant?
[295:37.14]I can't see.
[295:38.54]Up there?
[295:39.08]I think I gotta get up there.
[295:43.68]Get it back to where it was.
[295:51.63]There's one little area that I can just take a right.
[296:14.37]Alright, this is what we draw exponentially.
[296:17.11]There goes the zoo!
[296:17.85]20 minutes to get to 300.
[296:26.74]Not even close, but it's alright.
[296:28.46]I think the car is... Head back this way.
[296:44.51]I thought the song was over.
[296:45.35]It's not.
[296:48.22]So many people on the road.
[296:58.40]Can't pick anything up here.
[297:02.42]I gotta... I gotta... No, I just fell off.
[297:07.41]Only five minutes?
[297:08.33]That's not true.
[297:10.97]It's 18.
[297:11.39]I can get these, though.
[297:18.34]That thing right there says 12.
[297:19.44]I don't think I can go over there yet.
[297:22.36]Oh, you are really fucking irritating.
[297:27.90]I'm gonna go back up there.
[297:29.15]Can I fit through this anymore?
[297:51.21]Or... hold on.
[297:52.19]Where the fuck should I go from here?
[297:53.83]Up this way, maybe?
[297:54.87]Go to the parking lot up here.
[297:59.93]Have a bit of cars and all, so... There we go!
[298:13.37]Alright.
[298:15.65]Back into the town.
[298:16.89]Trees?
[298:19.02]Little trees!
[298:21.30]How did I even get up on the roof?
[298:35.44]I missed a 10 and I can pick up trees, and then once you get able to pick up trees, it's pretty much game over.
[298:52.55]Look at this shit.
[298:58.93]Look at all these cars.
[299:00.25]Come on.
[299:02.14]Knock the cars down.
[299:03.86]Give them to me!
[299:14.56]I can barely hear your voice.
[299:15.94]Well, now you can.
[299:25.10]Hydrate.
[299:26.20]What do you mean hydrate?
[299:28.42]I don't have time to drink water right now.
[299:40.45]Almost.
[299:41.79]Is he gonna go for it again?
[299:42.85]Why would he do this?
[299:44.49]Why would he do it again?
[299:47.29]Why would he do that again?
[299:48.43]Why would you do that again?
[299:51.10]I want a fucking five page essay tomorrow why you just did that a second time.
[299:58.73]Alright, I gotta get to the main town center, but I need to be big enough to get over there.
[300:01.89]Alright, I got trees, trees, trees, trees.
[300:03.21]It's time.
[300:12.08]I gotta be 12.
[300:12.64]I can go up this way.
[300:14.58]Yeah, here we go.
[300:15.34]I can make it.
[300:16.12]12 meters.
[300:21.44]Get over that.
[300:22.61]Let's do it.
[300:30.94]Why is there a floating house?
[300:40.79]Freeze!
[300:41.51]I just keep losing all momentum by running into one thing that I can't pick up.
[300:56.46]I wish I could see higher that way.
[301:08.20]I love how every time I get actually angry at a game, I do think Gonzo flies out of a cannon sound.
[301:25.29]Fucking idiot.
[301:27.07]Come on!
[301:28.65]Why would that stop there?
[301:31.74]And why can't I pick up these trees?
[301:34.00]Somebody shoot me out of a cannon!
[301:46.13]Marge Simpson.
[301:56.90]I wish I could pick those up, but I can't.
[302:01.50]Alright, stop.
[302:01.94]I need to see where I'm going.
[302:04.11]That way.
[302:11.09]Oh, homie.
[302:14.98]Alright, I have to pay attention.
[302:15.96]This is an important level.
[302:18.48]Stop.
[302:21.90]I can't concentrate.
[302:23.86]Oh, goddammit.
[302:25.00]If this makes me lose, I'm gonna fuckin' watch the first season of The Scripters.
[302:30.76]Houses.
[302:31.08]Can I get these yet?
[302:37.09]Yes!
[302:41.51]Yes.
[302:43.21]Alright.
[302:43.93]Let's go.
[302:51.79]Get out of my fucking way.
[302:53.03]I'm getting very angry.
[302:56.39]I'm getting Marge Simpson level of angry.
[303:00.75]Like, why can't I pick these up?
[303:07.41]I need to get to 300 meters.
[303:19.45]Squid is almost attainable, yes it is.
[303:21.41]It's getting close.
[303:28.72]We got 12 minutes.
[303:34.72]Back down here.
[303:39.90]Alright, Squid is not attainable yet.
[303:44.24]Not for another minute or two.
[303:51.36]Down towards this, the buildings over here.
[303:52.82]He's telling me I can't pick that up.
[303:58.35]Am I gonna get Marge Simpson over here to fucking yell at you?
[304:04.69]Up there, you can do it, I know you can, I've seen you do it before.
[304:08.43]I watched you do it.
[304:11.53]Mmm, yes!
[304:16.24]I'm getting stuck, I have too many things on me.
[304:23.02]Oh, me.
[304:26.18]40.
[304:27.04]Almost at 60.
[304:29.32]And I can go that way.
[304:30.07]Speaking of that way, let's go this way.
[304:40.95]Get it all.
[304:42.03]Get it all.
[304:43.04]Go get like the Wii Sports.
[304:46.14]Look at the Miis playing fucking basketball.
[304:56.82]Holy shit, I can get the wind turbines now.
[305:04.70]You can definitely make it over that.
[305:14.70]Alright, back to the other side.
[305:15.80]Oh god.
[305:20.51]60 meters, still just a toddler.
[305:24.01]Not for long though, this is gonna get out of control here in a minute.
[305:28.46]I gotta go the other way, I can't even physically go this way.
[305:39.93]Three hundred.
[305:41.17]You're missing me.
[305:43.17]Back over to the wind turbines, they're the biggest things I can get so far.
[305:47.15]A floating circus over there.
[305:54.39]All right, giant squid.
[305:56.71]Got him.
[306:03.11]What the hell is that?
[306:05.84]What is that thing?
[306:08.46]I can't even look at it yet.
[306:18.82]Once I get to 100, I can start to pick up actual islands.
[306:21.72]Is that a robot person?
[306:30.05]I'm gonna keep going this way.
[306:30.89]I'm just gonna try to get as much as I can here.
[306:32.41]I got nine minutes.
[306:41.08]Airplanes.
[306:41.60]I can get the little islands, right?
[306:44.36]Yep.
[306:48.82]Get up there!
[306:49.46]Oh, forget it.
[306:56.20]Even bigger!
[306:57.73]What the hell?
[306:58.41]I'm too big to fit through this little area.
[307:01.37]Get out of the way!
[307:02.45]No!
[307:09.06]Over a hundred meters.
[307:14.36]There's another squid over there.
[307:19.07]Hold on.
[307:24.71]I gotta go to that other area down there.
[307:28.70]This one's got a field goal, alright.
[307:31.34]Islands.
[307:34.45]Net in cage.
[307:43.69]I can't get the big ones quite yet.
[307:47.25]Oh, fucking hell, yes I can.
[307:48.93]150, this way.
[308:03.02]Giant Squid 2 is too big.
[308:09.17]Can't get him yet.
[308:09.77]Holy shit.
[308:23.94]Oh my god, I'm so big I don't know what else I can even pick up from here.
[308:27.30]This whole town right here.
[308:29.09]The whole stadium.
[308:34.63]Seven minutes.
[308:38.77]Giant mushroom.
[308:40.19]Squid.
[308:40.57]Back here.
[308:40.99]Oh, come on.
[308:51.07]I can get the weird, like... What is this, a raptor?
[308:59.96]Mogran.
[309:03.47]Alright.
[309:04.19]Back to the main town here.
[309:07.23]Giant squids are taking over the whole world.
[309:17.64]Alright.
[309:19.70]200 meters.
[309:20.20]Still just a preschooler.
[309:23.76]Oh, this is getting a little out of control.
[309:26.60]What is down here?
[309:29.74]What is that?
[309:30.50]Is it a monster?
[309:39.09]Oni Rock.
[309:46.49]Oni Island.
[309:49.33]Is that a living island?
[309:51.27]Can I get the giant mushroom?
[309:53.55]No, not yet.
[309:54.85]That's really important.
[309:55.53]I gotta get that.
[309:56.07]I gotta get the monster that's over here.
[309:57.27]Quit being stuck on this, please.
[309:58.89]I picked up a giant turtle, somehow.
[310:02.34]Another giant squid in another town.
[310:06.02]Giant octopus.
[310:12.44]Uh, come on.
[310:13.02]I can't... I'm passing through the rainbow.
[310:20.72]Oh, that's the... That's the plane!
[310:22.84]That's the rocket!
[310:24.68]I just picked up the rocket ship.
[310:25.90]275.
[310:26.30]Where the hell am I?
[310:32.79]Hello?
[310:43.96]Big enough islands.
[310:45.40]Windmill.
[310:47.60]Still not big enough.
[310:50.09]To get that tower here.
[310:56.11]Wow.
[310:56.95]I think that's the biggest building in the game.
[311:01.61]Oh, I'm picking up!
[311:05.32]What a nice Katamari.
[311:06.72]So pleasant and dreamy.
[311:09.34]I did it.
[311:10.24]And I'm about to start picking up whole entire sections of a board game.
[311:20.66]The bridge is what's gonna stop me here.
[311:27.70]Holy shit.
[311:31.88]I got it.
[311:32.28]I got the runway.
[311:36.50]I can't pick that.
[311:37.38]I'll give you the stadium.
[311:40.87]Stadium.
[311:41.37]Quick.
[311:43.01]Got it.
[311:45.11]I'm picking up clouds, mushrooms... I can't get the f***ing mushroom yet.
[311:49.56]What?
[311:50.78]How is that possible?
[311:57.54]Got the tower.
[312:04.31]That destroyed pretty much the whole world, except for right here.
[312:07.69]Got it.
[312:16.41]The only thing that's left are... I gotta get the rainbow.
[312:20.02]Oh, look at that.
[312:22.16]A whole civilization over here.
[312:23.34]It's gone.
[312:31.45]The volcano.
[312:32.21]Fuck.
[312:34.71]Can I get the rainbow?
[312:36.27]Yep.
[312:42.36]Give me this.
[312:43.80]Airport.
[312:49.68]I have to get this volcano.
[312:59.80]There's nothing left.
[313:00.72]I've destroyed the whole universe.
[313:05.34]Clouds.
[313:12.52]Tornadoes?
[313:13.24]There's an island over here I didn't get.
[313:21.23]Pigeon Town.
[313:27.47]There are things on the screen.
[313:28.87]Well, yeah, but I'm talking about major things.
[313:31.27]I mean, you can get all the mushrooms.
[313:35.44]I'm talking about landmarks.
[313:37.96]All the cities are all gone.
[313:42.47]There's one saddle.
[313:43.23]There's a giant cruise ship right here.
[313:44.83]Alright, I got the cruise ship.
[313:51.56]Go get the hurricane.
[313:54.02]Hurricane.
[313:54.48]Where is it?
[313:58.46]Here.
[314:02.55]I just got Mary.
[314:07.03]Get the mushrooms!
[314:10.17]Get the mushrooms!
[314:14.78]Mushroom XXXL.
[314:21.59]I'm picking up, like, the whole Antarctic right now.
[314:28.69]This is fucking crazy.
[314:33.18]Mushroom, mushroom.
[314:34.02]I'm at 800 meters.
[314:39.82]Why?
[314:40.08]What are the angels flying around me for?
[314:49.82]Got them all.
[314:50.38]No I didn't!
[314:55.53]Alright, got all the mushrooms.
[314:56.25]Everything else is just icing on the cake now.
[315:07.23]Scallop Island.
[315:08.22]823.
[315:11.00]There's nothing left.
[315:18.42]I've eaten the whole world.
[315:24.88]I picked up a cake.
[315:26.60]Yee-haw!
[315:29.50]It's floating, but it's not a dream.
[315:32.52]824 meters.
[315:35.89]How supple this silhouette, this substantial heft.
[315:40.47]This mellifluous mood and the rising tide of familial love.
[315:46.29]We are moved.
[315:46.77]When it gets this big, it's hard to tell what you have the most of.
[315:53.21]Plants.
[315:54.91]Still, plants isn't adorable.
[315:59.33]And somehow I still did not get the present.
[316:02.17]Is that what I'm understanding here?
[316:17.12]The moon has returned.
[316:19.18]Let's see the conclusion of the story.
[316:33.93]The moon is back in the sky.
[316:36.85]Welcome back, moon.
[316:38.55]This time we, the king, worked hard.
[316:40.77]We think we worked hard, we're pretty sure we did.
[316:43.52]Hm?
[316:45.54]Oh, it's you!
[316:46.00]Yes, what?
[316:46.44]What is it?
[316:47.78]Oh, I got it!
[316:49.00]Maybe the prince grew a teeny bit.
[316:51.52]Haha.
[316:52.44]You did, yes you did.
[316:53.26]At least a full one centimeter taller.
[316:55.33]This is also thanks to us, yes.
[317:00.21]That makes me 5'8".
[317:03.29]We are the champion.
[317:04.41]Yes.
[317:05.19]So all we need to do is put the rest of the stars back.
[317:08.50]Get cracking on them.
[317:19.14]Prince of Ouiji.
[317:22.15]King of Osama.
[317:25.43]Queen of Oihi.
[317:41.00]Oh, he's doing the Sour Please dance!
[317:43.30]Thank you.
[317:47.32]Total objects collected at 1171.
[317:58.61]824 meters.
[318:00.37]Wait, we're missing somebody.
[318:04.93]Who are we missing there?
[318:06.25]Did I not get somebody?
[318:13.38]Oh, it's me.
[318:14.22]Okay.
[318:14.34]Here we go.
[318:17.10]You thought it was over.
[318:18.58]Not quite.
[318:20.92]Hahaha.
[318:21.62]Hahaha.
[318:42.33]Every country on Earth.
[318:47.94]This is the real challenge now.
[318:50.74]And you can't spin.
[318:51.50]I have to go slow.
[318:53.86]One piece of time.
[318:55.42]Can't quite get... Not yet.
[319:14.90]Can we get anywhere in... I don't think we can.
[319:18.20]No, we can't get America.
[319:21.92]America is safe for now.
[319:28.26]There we go.
[319:34.92]Roll over all this.
[319:38.70]Can't pick up that.
[319:40.52]Canada's not going to fall.
[319:42.02]Oh, yes it will.
[319:47.31]Alright, I need to go... What can I even pick up right now?
[319:57.55]Okay.
[319:58.31]Pretty much all of Africa.
[320:11.25]I want to miss this little one here.
[320:14.73]Okay.
[320:14.91]I don't want to miss any countries.
[320:21.25]Whoever's left is the group that has to re-do the whole Earth.
[320:25.36]Okay.
[320:26.36]No, I'm not big enough for this one.
[320:29.56]Come on, give me Australia.
[320:31.54]No!
[320:32.48]It's actually easier to go this way.
[320:37.61]Because I can actually see the country before I go away.
[320:41.41]Alright, Canada gone.
[320:43.11]Canada gone, US gone.
[320:44.79]China gone.
[320:45.93]It's still here.
[320:51.81]Australia has to go down.
[320:57.64]There it goes.
[320:58.38]And there it goes, it was Antarctica.
[321:03.78]What country's left?
[321:06.93]Right here.
[321:07.33]Come on.
[321:08.15]Get it.
[321:08.59]Got it.
[321:10.27]There goes Russia.
[321:16.55]A few more here.
[321:20.94]What is this?
[321:23.96]Let's see.
[321:24.76]Fiji.
[321:25.38]What's left?
[321:27.74]No, this- what country's left?
[321:35.50]Produced by Namco.
[321:36.82]No, I gotta get every single one, man!
[321:41.32]Barbados?
[321:45.46]I see a couple right here!
[321:46.29]Hey, the sky isn't finished yet.
[322:07.98]Well, that is the base game customized.
[322:15.78]You might say it looks a little short.
[322:17.82]The main little story, little cute story there.
[322:21.56]Well, that's because this is a PlayStation 2 game.
[322:25.60]But it's not over.
[322:27.84]It's not over.
[322:30.76]Because you can do this as many times as you want.
[322:40.15]There's a lot to do.
[322:43.04]You can get high scores.
[322:47.38]And this is just the first one, so... I do have to try to... I have to do this.
[322:57.37]These are identical levels?
[322:59.23]Oh, yeah, but I mean, you can redo them.
[323:03.70]And that eternal mode is, I think, you can just do it as long as you want.
[323:14.66]It's a fun game.
[323:15.85]There are a ton of sequels.
[323:19.95]And the sequels are much larger and have way more going on, especially in some of the later ones.
[323:31.09]How many Katamari games are there?
[323:34.93]I missed one new one?
[323:35.87]Alright, let me try to get a decent pair.
[323:44.25]There are like five new ones?
[323:45.56]What?
[323:46.14]Did I miss five new levels?
[323:51.48]Is it mobile game too?
[323:54.86]No, I don't think so.
[324:03.14]Yeah, it's on iOS.
[324:04.00]I would really love... I mean, I know they did this, and this is cool, but they went back and... I just fucking... Whatever.
[324:10.37]A bear... Carving of a bear.
[324:11.89]It doesn't even look like a bear on the ground.
[324:13.19]Whatever.
[324:13.81]That's the smallest one I've picked up so far.
[324:16.97]That is tiny.
[324:18.23]That is the smallest one.
[324:19.96]That's... I'm not gonna go...
[324:35.46]Uh, no.
[324:37.46]I don't use a fridge.
[324:39.44]I buy food and eat it the same day.
[324:43.86]All right, let me see what you're talking about.
[324:47.82]Because I don't think there is a... There's this up here.
[324:53.91]The new levels are... Oh, oh, would you look at that?
[324:58.25]Would you look at that?
[324:59.17]There's a new level.
[325:02.16]I told you the game wasn't over!
[325:03.54]Make the North Star!
[325:10.98]For some reason, for some reason I don't feel comfortable at all.
[325:13.97]Is it because our royal present is missing?
[325:15.81]No, that's not it.
[325:16.95]Oh well, that's it, we get it.
[325:18.95]There's no center, there is no belly button.
[325:21.97]There is nothing solid in the center of the sky.
[325:24.91]That's why it's unstable, off-kilter, undignified, and preposterous.
[325:30.66]Oh, we remember now.
[325:32.14]It's the North Star.
[325:41.82]This level sucks.
[325:49.62]Who knows why, but make it exactly 10 meters.
[325:53.60]The closer it is to 10 meters, the brighter a North Star will be.
[325:57.98]But there's a catch, or maybe two, how big the Katamari is to start with nobody knows.
[326:04.03]But we will show you what 10 meters looks like.
[326:07.33]Ready?
[326:07.57]10 meters.
[326:13.01]Very, very simple.
[326:13.80]What?
[326:15.52]When you think your Katamari is 10 meters, summon us with the Y button.
[326:19.99]Much is expected of you, Prince of... Wait, what?
[326:26.99]Oh, shit.
[326:27.81]Okay, I have to guess when it's 10 meters.
[326:29.59]I have no idea.
[326:42.67]Wait, wait, wait.
[326:43.66]How big am I now?
[326:44.50]I'm big enough to pick up people.
[326:48.14]So I'm definitely at least two meters, right?
[326:55.57]That circle up there on the top left is how big I need to look.
[327:15.22]How tall, okay, how tall a car is, no, tree, meters, three feet, so, three, six, nine, twelve, fifteen, twenty, thirty feet, like, once I get to, like, seven, eight meters, that'd be a tree.
[327:32.78]I'm kind of close already.
[327:37.34]I gotta be careful.
[328:23.51]I'm pretty big.
[328:25.12]I'm probably five or six meters right now.
[329:25.33]All right.
[329:26.63]I'm right now... I'm like as big as a tree right now.
[329:29.49]I'm gonna go for it.
[329:33.00]Way, way too small.
[329:35.00]Go away and start over.
[329:50.93]10 meters is 30 feet.
[329:54.99]So... I don't really have a barometer to how tall these things are.
[330:09.69]Double the size.
[330:10.65]I'm pretty big right now.
[330:22.30]Oh, shit!
[330:23.08]Okay, I'm definitely 10 meters now.
[330:26.84]How tall is a normal telephone pole?
[330:33.38]Almost as big as a house.
[330:34.62]That's 30 feet.
[330:36.12]Yeah, I know, but how tall is your house?
[331:18.40]see whose house is that that house is like eight feet tall
[331:55.96]Okay.
[331:57.76]Is this size customarily okay?
[332:00.06]Yes.
[332:02.36]We are not certain, we are not at all sure.
[332:04.49]That's almost 8 meters!
[332:12.81]We rushed it.
[332:17.89]7.7, that's almost 8, that's 8 meters!
[332:21.13]Oh, that was close.
[332:30.50]Compact North Star.
[332:33.84]At least we did it.
[332:36.48]Seven meters equals trees.
[332:37.84]I can feel it.
[332:43.88]I can feel the cosmos.
[332:46.16]That reference image was shitty.
[332:48.34]Yeah, but we probably shouldn't have been going by that image then, huh?
[332:53.02]That's a C+, yeah, you're right.
[332:55.10]It is.
[332:59.10]We are exhausted.
[333:00.60]The sky is done.
[333:01.40]The sky is complete.
[333:02.58]Phew, we are tired.
[333:03.96]Rolling the Katamari is very hard.
[333:06.75]Right, Prince?
[333:07.49]Wasn't it hard?
[333:08.43]Wasn't it?
[333:09.67]Well, it was hard for us as well.
[333:12.51]To wash it from the cosmos was very hard.
[333:15.97]So, so boring.
[333:17.93]Half asleep we were.
[333:21.01]Ah, we can finally go home.
[333:22.15]Finally sleep in bed.
[333:24.00]Today will be a party day.
[333:25.46]Especially since the prince is finally two centimeters tall.
[333:30.98]We must celebrate.
[333:32.64]Mother, we need cake.
[333:37.09]Yeah, we talked about how that was chat before.
[333:39.43]Makes even more sense.
[333:41.81]Another party?
[333:42.45]Cool!
[333:43.85]We get to have another party sequence where I roll a six again.
[333:51.98]Party sequence two.
[333:58.13]We beat the game, beat the game.
[334:10.91]No, no, this is not credits, this is an actual party.
[334:17.26]It's the dinosaur.
[334:23.39]You're telling me that that guy wouldn't be a perfect fit for Smash Bros.
[334:26.09]DLC?
[334:39.10]Yes.
[334:39.90]See?
[334:41.57]Told you.
[334:43.47]Here we go again.
[334:44.13]Why is it giving me a credit sequence again?
[334:51.71]I did one extra level.
[334:59.09]Ah, now they're all there.
[335:00.91]Everybody's there now.
[335:02.59]Okay.
[335:05.57]I completed it for real.
[335:08.11]Skip this, please.
[335:09.21]I have to get every country.
[335:14.92]Somebody look it up right now.
[335:15.58]How many countries are on Earth?
[335:16.90]Uh, 324 or something, right?
[335:18.92]380?
[335:18.94]It's like 340.
[335:19.34]Okay.
[335:31.15]Five or something.
[335:32.25]I think it's more than that.
[335:33.05]365.
[335:33.23]Yeah, 365 countries in a year.
[335:33.95]Okay, 195.
[335:34.11]Okay.
[335:34.33]We're already almost there.
[335:58.99]I'll get it this time.
[336:00.01]121.
[336:00.15]140.
[336:00.31]Okay, now I get the big ones.
[336:33.79]155, 157... 167... 172... what did you say they were, 195?
[336:34.87]175.
[336:34.89]Alright, I gotta come down on it.
[336:40.12]So I can see.
[337:07.61]179.
[337:07.71]Come on.
[337:08.45]Right here.
[337:09.37]It's at least like 4 or 5 right here.
[337:13.07]183.
[337:13.09]185.
[337:14.67]Come on!
[337:17.55]No! 188.
[337:36.22]191 192 Where are the last three?
[337:39.96]Last three countries in the world One, two Two Last country Where's the final country?
[337:59.62]Where's the final country?
[338:04.39]Oh no
[338:12.94]Can anybody see it?
[338:22.12]I see it!
[338:22.50]I see it!
[338:22.80]I see it!
[338:23.08]I see it!
[338:27.04]No!
[338:28.58]I didn't see it.
[338:30.02]There's only 194 countries on Earth, guys.
[338:44.28]That's it.
[338:46.02]There's 194 countries.
[338:55.77]There actually are 210.
[339:03.43]Well, I think that is it for this game.
[339:07.39]I don't think there's any secret levels.
[339:09.42]We just did one secret level.
[339:15.48]Okay, uh, so... Alright, so... What?
[339:21.38]The ending?
[339:29.69]Oh, fuck, no.
[339:30.43]We already did this.
[339:31.29]Okay.
[339:39.87]Yeah, that's the end.
[339:40.83]Arrow's the ending.
[339:43.12]End of the stream, boys.
[339:44.32]Yeah, I think that's a... I think this is a good place to call it tonight.
[339:48.08]Six hours?
[339:54.69]That's a... that's a good... I think that's a perfect length.
[340:05.92]I thought this was Cool Vegas Germo.
[340:07.62]What do you mean?
[340:08.82]Wait, to the Moon Memorial.
[340:15.52]Opening movie, chapters... Staff credits... Yeah, this is just... Uh, let's see, let's... Uh, can you just pick from here, too?
[340:29.27]Oh.
[340:30.69]It's just these.
[340:36.48]Cool German would go eight hours.
[340:40.11]Well, we're doing the bits, so we'll probably go for, I don't know, maybe six and a half hours tonight?
[340:49.23]And then tomorrow, I didn't know how long this was gonna take us, so tomorrow is gonna be something different!
[340:58.05]And then we're building a birdhouse on either Thursday or Friday, probably Friday.
[341:07.97]Oh yeah, EDF, right.
[341:08.93]Does EDF come out tomorrow?
[341:10.61]Oh, that... I know what we're doing tomorrow.
[341:14.76]Earth Defense Force 5.
[341:15.60]EDF 5 comes out tomorrow.
[341:26.14]So... You promised to peek your mic.
[341:28.58]No, but I immediately said I'm not doing it.
[341:30.35]I immediately corrected myself.
[341:36.96]Uh, so tomorrow, if all internet goes to plan and the servers work and everything, right?
[341:44.71]Uh, I think... I think me, Star, and Italics are gonna try to play it.
[341:50.23]At least that's the... I mean, I gotta ask those people.
[341:54.45]You know what I mean?
[341:55.77]I'm pretty sure that's the plan.
[341:59.97]Check out the sound library.
[342:01.25]Why not?
[342:01.59]Alright, these are all the songs.
[342:07.90]Here is the OST.
[342:09.54]Very good.
[342:14.48]Yeah, so EDF tomorrow, and then the birdhouse building stream a day or two after that.
[342:25.66]Lonely Rolling Star.
[342:27.18]Okay.
[342:27.62]Alright, I'll just have this in the background instead of my usual song.
[342:32.88]Thank you everybody for coming.
[342:37.65]See you tomorrow.
[342:39.54]Probably around 3 p.m.
[342:40.78]Pacific.
[342:42.32]Something like that.
[342:42.90]Between, like, 2 and 4.
[342:45.00]Because anytime you play with other people, you do have to essentially go with, uh... You know, you gotta change schedules and stuff around everybody being able to play at the same time, so... So, let's do the bits.
[343:06.84]Go back a few hours ago here.
[343:08.92]Six hours ago now.
[343:09.80]Uh, thank you to... Thank you to Snuggly for the one dollar.
[343:17.27]Please do a goofy impression.
[343:20.89]Like a goofy impression or an impression of the character Goofy from Disney?
[343:33.10]Like the goo- the goof- a goofy- or like, oh, I'm like, fu- look at me, whoa, look at me!
[343:37.39]Yeah, I just did it.
[343:47.05]Thank you, uh, Snuggly, for the $1.
[343:49.87]Snuggly, again, thanks for the $2.
[343:50.91]It's an Imgur link.
[343:55.43]Oh, dear.
[343:57.89]Uh, the tag on this thing, the message says, I will make more.
[344:08.02]I will make more.
[344:12.12]Is that like a threat?
[344:15.14]I'm gonna make more of these, you better believe it, here they come.
[344:18.06]You understand?
[344:18.54]Dab.
[344:23.40]Yep.
[344:30.79]Look at how fucking jacked I look.
[344:34.85]Thank you, Snuggly.
[344:38.87]Uh, Snuggly, again, there's another Imgr link.
[344:42.07]And I think they did it again.
[344:42.91]No, it's, it's, it's like a Garfield post.
[344:47.29]It's me in a Garfield costume.
[344:48.61]Like it, it's, alright.
[344:54.63]Well, you did make more, that's true.
[344:58.67]Thank you for your... three, four, four, five dollars here.
[345:04.41]Thank you, Snuggly.
[345:05.80]Sticks and Renegade, thanks for the one dollar.
[345:07.12]This intro song is more painful than the abscess I had.
[345:10.18]What?!
[345:13.08]Everybody loves Katamari.
[345:14.82]The Katamari theme song is... the opening intro is one of the most iconic, well-liked video game song in history.
[345:25.58]What are you talking about?
[345:31.06]It was the song that went beep boop?
[345:36.02]Beep boop.
[345:41.10]Thank you, those sticks.
[345:41.86]Thank you, Divas P. Divas, thanks for three bucks.
[345:45.64]Every single stream, you've given three dollars.
[345:48.44]Every time.
[345:52.52]Thank you.
[345:54.10]No messages.
[345:54.62]You never write a message.
[345:56.77]But I do appreciate it.
[345:59.56]Uh, Snuggly, again, has another Imgur link.
[346:07.10]Uh... What the hell is this?
[346:12.92]What does this have to do with anything?
[346:14.16]It's Shaggy that... Shaggy just beat up Superman.
[346:18.40]Seems you've forgotten what the S stands for in your suit.
[346:20.70]Do you need me to remind you?
[346:21.92]No, please.
[346:22.44]It stands for Shaggy.
[346:23.78]Don't hurt me.
[346:24.40]I'll do anything.
[346:25.10]Don't unleash your wrath.
[346:26.40]What does this have to do with anything?
[346:32.03]I don't- I don't understand what this means.
[346:40.86]What the fuck is that?
[346:41.92]I don't understand.
[346:47.34]I'm too old.
[346:48.36]Uh, thank you Just Langford for the $1.85.
[346:54.96]Derma, you're a bit inspiration to me since I watched Man vs. Machine wave 666 back in like 2012.
[347:02.60]I don't remember.
[347:03.06]It's been so long.
[347:04.58]Thanks for making life fun.
[347:08.32]Thank you for hanging out.
[347:10.48]And I miss Man vs. Machine.
[347:14.30]I really wish that they would do it more of it.
[347:16.35]I wish somebody would just make a man versus machine video game with just a ton of items and make it difficult and not just have it all ready to go and not monetized like crazy.
[347:30.48]I just want a $60 man versus machine game.
[347:39.30]Isn't that EDF?
[347:40.28]It kind of is.
[347:42.50]Now I'm starting to understand why I like EDF so much.
[347:48.18]That's what base Fortnite is?
[347:49.58]No, but base... No, it... I don't want to build any bases.
[347:53.44]I don't want to build a fucking Minecraft house and then shoot plants versus zombies enemies.
[348:06.95]But... It is a game mode that I think is a lot of fun.
[348:16.45]But thank you, Joss Langford.
[348:20.25]Thank you also to Son of Jenova for the one dollar.
[348:21.99]You said September and then your laugh sounded like September from Earth, Wind, and Fire.
[348:26.31]Huh?
[348:26.87]What do you mean?
[348:30.90]September of this year.
[348:32.34]Wait, hold on.
[348:35.38]I'm sorry, I just fucking smashed your head.
[348:36.96]Alright, what is this?
[348:39.14]I said September.
[348:40.24]September of this year.
[348:55.04]What?
[348:56.92]You've got to be kidding me.
[348:59.04]September of this year.
[349:02.08]Do you remember?
[349:12.37]How did you pick up on that?
[349:15.37]That's fucking crazy.
[349:16.73]September of this year.
[349:25.60]The 21st night of September.
[349:29.85]Well, yeah, that's, that's kind of insane, but thank you for that.
[349:33.97]I don't, I can't even, how do I even respond to that?
[349:46.94]Thank you, though.
[349:48.08]Thank you, Darkstar.
[349:50.14]700,000 games for the $1.
[349:51.22]This first semester away from home has been a wild one for me with the hurricane destroying my dorm and all.
[349:57.29]But through all of it, I've had your wonderful streams to help me unwind.
[350:01.19]I sincerely mean this.
[350:03.11]I love you.
[350:03.95]Keep it rolling.
[350:04.99]Prince of all comedy.
[350:09.56]I'm honored to even be mentioned as a prince of comedy.
[350:15.34]Thank you so much, Darkstar.
[350:16.50]It's great to have you around.
[350:24.06]Thank you for being part of this community for as long as you have.
[350:31.37]Prince of comedy.
[350:32.51]Master of comedy.
[350:34.15]That's not me, though.
[350:34.79]That's a different person.
[350:36.97]But thank you so much, Darkstar.
[350:38.93]Take care of yourself.
[350:41.97]All the best.
[350:44.88]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the $1.
[350:46.92]Alert, alert, incoming Garfagraph.
[350:49.86]Race for impact.
[350:51.66]Hey, Jerma, I had a dream that Batman went nuts and was played by Jim Carrey.
[350:55.89]Don't know why I felt the need to mention that, but I can't watch the whole stream.
[351:01.21]Yeah, I mean, everybody's looking forward to Avengers 4.
[351:23.07]It's gonna just be the... It's gonna be the next movie in the Marvel series, and it's a big movie.
[351:29.93]Who's not excited to see that movie?
[351:31.61]You're not excited to see that?
[351:34.13]No?
[351:37.97]Okay, I mean, if you're not, then you're not.
[351:39.75]That's alright.
[351:41.37]I think it's gonna be a pretty fun movie.
[351:45.91]But, yeah.
[351:47.05]Thank you, Garfield.
[351:48.68]Hasnain, thanks for the $1.
[351:49.92]My roommate is questioning why he's hearing a grown man moan from my room.
[351:53.43]Thanks, German.
[351:57.13]Well, did you tell him that I was playing Katamari Damacy re-rolled?
[352:00.69]And trying to go over, uh, trying to get the ball to go up with physics is hard and it's like, makes you have to grunt a little?
[352:10.01]Why, yeah, I, people tell me, hey man, like, you, you, you like screamed and you like screamed something crazy and woke up my dog.
[352:20.54]You just got me like in full blast in your living room?
[352:26.07]What, you got me?
[352:27.17]How many bars do you have?
[352:28.39]You know, like the TV volume bars?
[352:30.03]You don't have me like 80% of the way up, do you?
[352:36.53]Who doesn't do that?
[352:43.72]Xbox, record that.
[352:47.76]But, uh, sorry about that, Hasnain.
[352:49.18]I'm...
[352:50.20]Maybe drop the volume two notches.
[352:52.52]Maybe.
[352:59.42]I do, actually.
[353:00.12]I'm in my living room.
[353:00.88]Well, alright.
[353:07.45]Hey, any way you can watch the stream.
[353:10.17]That's fine by me, right?
[353:12.43]Hey, Flying Trolley, thanks for the one dollar.
[353:14.13]Have you considered the possibility of stealing Star's mic and peaking it?
[353:17.77]That way you won't have to damage your microphone.
[353:21.03]Also, that song.
[353:22.79]Well, it would be very hard for me to steal Steri's microphone because we live in different states.
[353:29.44]So, that would be very difficult to do that.
[353:33.20]It would take a long time for me to pull that off.
[353:38.98]Steal it.
[353:39.50]Steal his mic.
[353:40.10]How do you want me to do that?
[353:49.56]Just get a plane ticket.
[353:56.57]No.
[353:58.59]Anyways, thank you, Flying Trolley.
[353:59.75]Thank you, Extra Cheesy, for the $1.
[354:01.19]Man, picking up all those erasers sure was inherently satisfying, wouldn't you say?
[354:05.89]I would.
[354:06.89]It was great.
[354:09.41]Picking up the rubber, the ice creams.
[354:11.97]It's a very satisfying experience.
[354:19.00]Uh... Moist in Tidy Whities.
[354:23.08]What?
[354:23.26]$5.
[354:23.28]Thank you.
[354:26.58]Thank you for the $5.
[354:30.11]Thank you, smelly boy, for the $1.
[354:33.93]Thank you.
[354:35.31]I have a final exam tomorrow morning that I may do very poorly on.
[354:38.54]Thank goodness, instead of studying, I'm watching this fantastic stream.
[354:43.10]Thanks, Jeremy.
[354:46.03]Um, just do as good as you can.
[354:49.21]Get a good night's sleep.
[354:50.39]Make sure you have breakfast in the morning.
[354:52.25]And remember, it's not about getting an A on the final.
[354:55.95]It's about passing the class.
[354:57.67]It's about getting a good enough grade where you get the diploma.
[355:03.35]Where you pass.
[355:04.75]You know?
[355:11.36]You don't gotta get an A-plus on everything.
[355:12.90]Don't feel that kind of pressure.
[355:16.86]I would say you should strive to get my Twitch Social Blade grade, which is a B-.
[355:28.23]If you're able to reach and get to my level of B- on Twitch, my Social Blade, then you don't have to go any higher.
[355:37.07]Why would you have to go higher than that?
[355:44.63]Humble brag.
[355:45.63]Nah, but Dickens, that's a B- means you did it and you're good enough.
[355:51.42]But you don't get like an A+.
[355:53.84]You don't have to get an A+.
[355:55.82]And if you do, great, I'm glad you did.
[356:02.30]You're a B-?
[356:05.18]When did I become a B-?
[356:08.52]Holy shit, B- now, guys!
[356:14.48]Oh, boy.
[356:17.28]So you really should be looking for a B+, is what you should be getting.
[356:20.78]Anything under that and it's like, I don't know, maybe, don't do that.
[356:26.69]You don't need an A-, B+.
[356:29.71]That means you tried enough and you did a good enough job.
[356:33.71]And you did, really, that's a pretty, that's a great job, actually.
[356:36.36]B means great.
[356:37.58]B+, is great.
[356:39.50]Below B+, B and B-, stay away from that.
[356:49.16]I was a B- like yesterday.
[356:50.67]I literally looked at that like two days ago.
[356:54.49]B plus umer streamer, boomer streamer.
[357:01.51]No, do your best, for real.
[357:04.43]If your best is a B, then that's your best, and that's fucking fine.
[357:07.91]You don't have to get an A+.
[357:08.83]If A plus is your best, then congratulations, you're a smart, smart person, and you're really good at what you do.
[357:15.24]Any of you get a C?
[357:16.10]C minus.
[357:16.68]I was like a C and a B student in college, so don't worry about it.
[357:19.42]I had like a 2.7 or 2.8 GPA in college.
[357:30.41]And look at me now.
[357:32.53]I ate a half of a sandwich out of the trash three days ago.
[357:37.81]And I still have trouble tying my shoes and wiping my ass.
[357:41.57]So, I mean, look at where I've come.
[357:55.13]You what?
[357:56.41]Giving terrible advice.
[357:57.55]I'm just fucking around.
[357:59.05]I hope you guys understand that.
[358:05.36]But, good luck on your finals, those of you that have them.
[358:08.28]Hope you do well.
[358:10.88]Hey, extra cheesy thanks to the $1.
[358:12.34]Local streamer is... creates... Oh, that's not very nice.
[358:22.73]That's not a very nice thing to say.
[358:26.49]I've already bombed my finals and ate trash sandwiches.
[358:35.23]Are you going to do any more green screen nights?
[358:40.63]Why don't you just work at the trash yard like your dad?
[358:46.43]Well, because...
[358:56.87]Because I'm not my dad, okay?
[358:58.63]I'm my own person.
[359:00.41]We're all our own person.
[359:05.59]Work at the trash.
[359:14.06]You and your dad just switched jobs for a day.
[359:29.63]Ugh.
[359:32.27]That'd be pretty hard to do.
[359:35.25]Thank you, though.
[359:35.83]Thank you, Andoxin, for the $1.50.
[359:37.65]That Flash game stream was one of the funniest I've laughed in a long time.
[359:42.59]I had to tune out near the end of the Bloons game, but I hope everyone had a great time.
[359:45.77]P.S.
[359:46.03]I'm really surprised the chat never tried to make a dick.
[359:49.33]Hey, love ya!
[359:51.45]Well, you left prematurely.
[359:53.23]Because they did.
[359:54.69]Multiple times.
[359:56.51]And they put something bad in the germ of mouth over here.
[360:02.85]And I'm not going to have that happen.
[360:05.13]That was awful, and I'm not going to have that happen again.
[360:07.19]You lost privileges forever.
[360:10.23]You lost your privileges forever.
[360:16.82]It'll come back in like a week.
[360:21.67]One more for the road.
[360:22.87]Oh, yeah.
[360:23.19]I forgot about that.
[360:26.53]But thank you to Anne Doxson.
[360:30.03]Thank you, Marvish McGally, for the $1.
[360:31.45]Hey, Germ Boy, I just made the math.
[360:35.16]Oh, that, what you said, you're talking about 150 hours of old streams to catch up with.
[360:39.88]And they said, can you stop streaming for 150 days?
[360:41.44]It's a reasonable request.
[360:43.16]I'm giving you a dollar to do it.
[360:44.34]Thanks in advance.
[360:46.63]Well, we're streaming tomorrow.
[360:47.99]And then we're streaming a day or two after that.
[360:49.49]And then making a birdhouse.
[360:55.36]But thank you, Mahbash Magali.
[360:59.96]Snuggly again for $1.
[361:01.14]Hey, Gemma, please audition to play a plastic man in the upcoming Plastic Man movie.
[361:08.54]What?
[361:08.84]I... What?
[361:11.88]Is that a superhero?
[361:12.84]I don't understand.
[361:14.56]I don't know.
[361:16.72]I really don't know half of these references.
[361:22.94]I must look like such a fucking idiot when I say, oh yeah, plastic man, and do a dog head tilt.
[361:29.04]And then the people are just laughing like, he said, he's doing it.
[361:36.62]And then I'm like holding my hands up to, I was, I was, I was, huh?
[362:01.59]Thank you for the dollar and the reference that I don't understand.
[362:05.81]I've never done stand-up.
[362:14.08]I already told you guys about the idea of me going to an open mic night and streaming it, getting permission to stream it, and just seeing what happened.
[362:30.24]I'm gonna try to come up with a bunch of material and see what happens when I try to entertain a real actual crowd of comedy goers.
[362:41.29]And see how badly I get booed.
[362:45.87]Or, who knows?
[362:51.43]That would be very stressful to watch.
[362:55.07]What if I went in there unprepared and just tried to make stuff up on the spot?
[362:58.84]Now that would be really, really hard to watch.
[363:06.98]The chat will laugh while the crowd boos.
[363:11.22]We aren't real enough to you?
[363:12.88]No, no, I mean like comedy goers.
[363:18.96]Like people in the audience at the comedy club.
[363:26.23]No, that's not what I meant.
[363:27.13]That's not what I meant.
[363:29.59]You guys know what I meant.
[363:30.39]We're not comedy goers.
[363:31.85]No, you know, we're not all sitting in a... Well, I guess we kind of are.
[363:36.15]No, but we're not at a comedy club and I'm not on stage with a mic.
[363:38.80]Yes, I am.
[363:40.24]There's a mic right here.
[363:42.32]I'm in a digital stage.
[363:48.20]Fuck, I guess I'm wrong.
[363:49.46]I guess that was incorrect.
[363:56.63]Just stream Comedy Night.
[363:58.03]No, because Comedy Night is... When that came out, I was like, oh, that might be interesting to do.
[364:03.65]And then I saw a couple of videos of people just, like, getting in close to their mics.
[364:08.60]Like, you get, like, a one-minute turn, and then you have to watch, like, eight fucking dickheads come up and be like... And then it's like, all right, what's happening with the next guy?
[364:28.70]And then you get your turn again in like a minute, and then you try to come up with a funny joke, and then you get booed.
[364:35.08]He did not peek, he did peek the mic.
[364:43.93]Did I?
[364:44.19]No I didn't, I turned it down.
[364:50.23]So, no, no comedy night.
[364:54.12]Maybe at real comedy club comedy night.
[364:57.66]If I ever want to publicly embarrass myself.
[365:00.64]For like an hour.
[365:01.73]And no, it wouldn't even be an hour.
[365:02.85]That's why, how would I stream that?
[365:05.19]That would be like a 12 minute stream.
[365:06.87]You only get like six or seven minutes.
[365:09.35]When you go on stage for an open mic night, you don't get like an hour.
[365:11.85]It's not like in presenting, Jerma985!
[365:14.64]And it's like, oh yeah, there he is!
[365:15.88]And I come out and get an hour and a half on stage.
[365:18.20]No, I get like three minutes.
[365:25.87]I'm gonna go up there and tell like three awful jokes and no one's gonna think it's funny and then I'm gonna turn the stream off.
[365:39.69]Just put on disguises and go up more than once and then I'll get thrown out of this comedy club.
[365:49.09]And that would be even more embarrassing because then I can never go back there.
[365:58.80]It'll be funny for us.
[366:04.82]Alright, well... Sure, I'll go get banned from a comedy club on stream.
[366:09.66]That sounds like a great time to me.
[366:13.48]I'll get like thrown out, and then we can sit on the sidewalk and chat for like 10 minutes before I get in my Uber.
[366:31.73]Anywho.
[366:33.53]We've got some more bits to go through.
[366:38.67]Thank you to... Oh, that was TK Reaper, by the way, with the stand-up question.
[366:44.80]Thank you for the $5.
[366:49.08]Drosophilia, thanks for the $1.
[366:50.64]King of the Cosmos for Germania 2019.
[366:52.60]One stream.
[366:57.05]One stream.
[366:59.57]One, like, six-hour stream?
[367:00.97]Is that enough to be on a... Is that enough to be on the Rumble?
[367:05.75]I'm not so sure.
[367:06.39]It'd be hard to make.
[367:11.06]Maybe.
[367:13.06]Quiet Man made it in.
[367:13.90]But Quiet Man was... I mean, that was like a four-hour stream, but that felt like 40 hours of streams.
[367:18.76]So it's like how I feel.
[367:22.06]Right?
[367:23.42]That could have been like a 36-hour stream.
[367:30.27]Maybe.
[367:31.67]He's a great character.
[367:32.35]I think he's hilarious.
[367:33.23]I think he's fun and interesting.
[367:34.21]Because it's not a gamer room.
[367:37.93]My gamer room.
[367:38.33]No, I have...
[367:54.04]Because I don't do- I do other things in here besides play games.
[367:57.52]I sit in this chair, and I open up other things that are not video games here.
[368:04.04]Like- like for instance, like for instance, like editing, and Discord, and... You are- that is- I- you are taking this in the wrong direction.
[368:20.66]Like communicating and setting up the streams and cleaning.
[368:29.61]You don't edit anymore.
[368:30.59]Yes, I do.
[368:32.37]Yes, I do!
[368:38.01]He doesn't edit.
[368:40.87]Where do you think the balloon video came from?
[368:51.01]So it's your gamer room.
[369:02.48]It was live.
[369:02.98]It was live!
[369:06.43]Where do you think that feed came from?
[369:07.69]Who plugged in the feed into the computer in the middle of the desert?
[369:17.71]I didn't.
[369:18.93]Somebody else did.
[369:22.31]I had hired somebody to set up a follow-me landing in Las Vegas.
[369:29.83]It was like $6,700 to get that person to follow that balloon as it came into Nevada.
[369:39.42]And then they had to plug in like a bunch of microphones and a bunch of streaming equipment.
[369:43.22]And they had to get one of those super 5G bricks.
[369:46.09]That person's still paying like $400 a month for that.
[369:49.01]I demanded that they get that so that you could see it.
[369:51.91]Because you've got like 4- 3G in the middle of the desert?
[369:55.87]Are you serious?
[370:07.78]Why does everything cost $6,700?
[370:14.70]Just does.
[370:17.97]Thank you to... Okay, Captain Worgen says it's a gamer room, it's not an office.
[370:24.79]I do office work in here.
[370:25.83]I went over taxes in here.
[370:28.48]Do you go over taxes in your gamer room?
[370:31.06]My taxes!
[370:37.13]You don't do taxes in your gamer room.
[370:48.98]I sing in here sometimes.
[370:51.62]I gotta make sure nobody's in the house and I just sing.
[370:55.49]Do you sing in your gamer room?
[370:56.81]Do you open up Fruity Loops and get a track ready and sing?
[371:14.66]I love how somebody just wrote, S-T-F-U.
[371:17.64]Like shut the fuck up.
[371:28.64]Anyways.
[371:32.36]Why would I ban?
[371:33.48]Why would I ban them?
[371:40.27]Thank you Jess for the $1.
[371:41.47]What do you think of that?
[371:45.77]What do you think of that super volcano under Yellowstone that could erupt any day now?
[371:50.47]I don't know what you mean, but you just... I'm scared now.
[371:55.47]There's a super volcano?
[371:59.16]Is that happening?
[372:01.54]Holy shit.
[372:02.34]RedShell just gave 20 community subs.
[372:08.50]It's true.
[372:10.79]RedShell, thank you for your 20 subs.
[372:20.05]Thank you so much.
[372:24.97]That's a huge amount of money, huge amount of subs.
[372:27.48]In one second.
[372:30.62]Almost at 200,000 followers, how close are we?
[372:31.96]How close are we to 200,000?
[372:32.52]199,383.
[372:34.46]The Yellowstone thing is a meme.
[372:35.30]Phew, thank goodness.
[372:48.06]I don't know guys, memes have done lots and lots of damage before.
[372:51.82]Just look at the gnome video and the irreparable damage that that video has caused.
[372:56.04]Listen to all those Tim Allens.
[373:18.15]volcano erupts.
[373:19.53]I don't even know.
[373:23.53]I don't even want to know what's inside of that volcano.
[373:27.95]I hope that never happens.
[373:33.88]But congrats to all the people that just got subs.
[373:36.18]And thanks for the extreme generosity of RedShell.
[373:38.22]Thank you.
[373:41.35]I didn't go grow up quite normally after that.
[373:42.63]Why would you substitute teacher be showing you R-rated movies?
[373:44.65]That's like a call the superintendent scenario.
[374:13.45]Cool teacher?
[374:19.52]No, you pick up the phone, you dial your superintendent, like... Hello, this is the superintendent.
[374:25.66]Hey, what's going on?
[374:26.54]I just, first of all, I mean, I'm a local resident, and the first thing I have to say is, man, I wish you would cancel school when we get all that snow, and for some reason when we have, like...
[374:36.51]four, five, six inches of snow on the ground, and you don't want to close the schools, and I have to sit there and watch the local news as every fucking school in the entire district goes by alphabetically and see, there's that one, there's that one, and mine gets skipped.
[374:51.15]And it's not up there, and I have to go to fucking school.
[374:56.07]Second of all, uh, actually, I forget why I called you.
[375:01.50]Why did I call the superintendent?
[375:07.23]Oh, right.
[375:07.67]A guy is showing R-rated movies in this class.
[375:11.45]That's just not okay.
[375:14.17]Cancel more fucking classes because it's snowing, you fucking... Bye.
[375:18.79]Fucking dick.
[375:22.26]What happened to the music?
[375:23.96]Is it still playing the same song?
[375:30.44]Is it playing any song?
[375:33.84]It's just been playing Lonely Star on repeat.
[375:36.42]Oh, goodness.
[375:37.38]Now, how about, uh... How about this one?
[375:52.70]This one.
[375:53.74]No, this one.
[375:57.60]No, how about this one?
[375:59.88]Yeah, this is good.
[376:01.12]This is perfect.
[376:04.76]Anyway, so thank you to Swiggity Swanky for the $1.
[376:07.92]Thank you Hands Beats for the $3.
[376:09.56]What do you think about all this Article 13 stuff?
[376:12.32]If that law passes, no one in the EU will be able to watch the stream anymore.
[376:18.35]Uh... It's... That's fucking stupid.
[376:21.21]I don't know why everyone's so... Why is everybody so afraid of the internet?
[376:28.33]You know what I mean?
[376:29.01]It's been around for so long at this point.
[376:30.53]Like, why are people so scared of the internet?
[376:41.33]it's like what what's the problem here it's because they saw the shpi video
[376:57.63]Now, I don't know the complete and total ins and outs of Article 13, but there's been shit like that before.
[377:03.95]And this stuff is already, like, happening, where it's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, nobody can have the internet.
[377:09.08]Hey, hold on a second.
[377:10.30]Somebody, hold on a second, somebody, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[377:14.82]You were in, you were inside of a mall, and the mall was playing a song over the radio.
[377:23.72]And in that song, there was a sample from a TV show.
[377:31.81]Everybody in the mall is under arrest.
[377:35.97]I don't understand.
[377:42.23]How are they going to do that?
[377:44.29]Hold on, there's an internet person on here that just played a song that they don't have the rights to.
[377:49.52]You're all going to jail.
[377:54.54]Like, you know when you're walking around in Walmart and they're just playing fucking music?
[377:58.60]They're playing, like, ads and shit?
[378:00.82]Do you think Walmart has the rights to play fucking whatever local radio station is blasting songs through the PA?
[378:16.46]They do.
[378:17.42]They do?
[378:17.76]They actually do?
[378:21.42]I hear, like, radio stations.
[378:26.53]So Mr. Walmart gets the rights to like 10,000 radio stations.
[378:30.23]I mean, I understand people and, you know, companies wanting to be paid for services and stuff and...
[378:56.14]But I don't think blocking and banning is the right way to do it.
[379:02.61]Because how are you supposed to share things with people?
[379:04.43]You know what I mean?
[379:06.05]Like, hey, dude, come here.
[379:07.51]I found this really cool song that I want you to listen to.
[379:09.49]Take a listen.
[379:10.84]Oh, hey, but you got to pay me first, though.
[379:16.00]How are you supposed to, like, share stuff?
[379:17.74]You know what I mean?
[379:25.00]Like, if you think about it, it's very core.
[379:29.28]It's... People used to sit around and listen to like a record player, right?
[379:33.81]And now we've gotten so connected.
[379:39.96]That the new record player where everyone's hanging out in the room listening to like 30 people all at a party listening to a record.
[379:46.83]You know, people are streaming or listening to the radio or playing music or... It's a new world.
[379:53.58]It's a different, you know, it's hard to... I understand the difficulty in trying to figure out how to go about policing it and figuring it out, but it's almost impossible.
[380:14.19]Where's my money?
[380:19.56]But I think there's a difference between... You know, obviously like there's DMCA takedowns and stuff, but outright banning websites is just... Don't we already have systems in place that do this shit already?
[380:37.23]Don't we already have systems that will take things down or monetize for whoever the creator is or... Do we have to ban entire websites?
[380:51.63]Boomers like Jerma ruin everything.
[381:04.58]Boomers like Jerma.
[381:16.60]No, I don't want to get political here.
[381:20.96]go any further than that, but I think there's a different way you can go about doing that.
[381:24.94]And outright, it's the same shit with the net neutrality stuff.
[381:28.61]Well, if you have Verizon, you can't go to Netflix anymore.
[381:33.49]If you have Comcast, you can go to Netflix.
[381:36.89]It's just... Why?
[381:38.71]Why does that even have to be a thing?
[381:41.29]Why would that even be a possibility?
[381:52.52]Because money.
[381:55.01]I guess... I just feel like there's a better way.
[382:02.03]Oh, because of big bits!
[382:06.48]Jerma isn't even a good boomer, he's a Left 4 Dead 2 boomer.
[382:14.28]What the fuck?
[382:17.08]A good boomer?
[382:18.85]A Left 4 Dead boomer?
[382:20.05]What are you talking about?
[382:21.09]Fat?
[382:28.98]but talking about stuff like this is a whole can it's a can of worms that when it's opened is just there's so much to even discuss
[382:46.76]There's too much to discuss and we could sit here all night and talk about this kind of shit.
[382:51.28]But... I hope that, uh, sensible... I hope there are sensible things that are done.
[382:58.25]And that people don't just jump right to conclusions immediately.
[383:08.98]It's just almost like, hey, we gotta do it right now.
[383:10.94]We gotta do it right now.
[383:11.58]We have to change the internet now, tonight, tomorrow.
[383:14.88]Hurry, hurry, do it, do it, do it.
[383:16.08]We're gonna just go, come on.
[383:18.56]It's like this is one of the most important mediums in history.
[383:24.58]I think it needs to be treated with a little more, let's figure this shit out, you know what I mean?
[383:38.29]Like, the probably most important thing that's happened in the last 30 years, 40, at least 50 years in regards to technology, right?
[383:46.54]The internet, especially where it is now, technologically is just, I mean, you're talking about like the invention of the fucking wheel back in the caveman times.
[384:05.13]As an important politician, I'd like to know what this internet thing is.
[384:09.23]This is nice background music for political discussion.
[384:16.20]I wasn't even listening to it.
[384:17.64]Yeah, this is, like, didn't fit.
[384:26.34]Oh, well.
[384:33.53]The fact that we are watching this stream right now would blow people's minds back in the 90s.
[384:37.28]Oh, that's what I mean!
[384:39.32]It's such an insane stepping stone for humanity.
[384:48.50]That it needs to be done in, I think, a lot slower, a lot different, and a lot more people need to be part of the equation.
[384:57.83]You know, it can't just be like three guys that are like, I think this is what it should be.
[385:01.41]No, you gotta get every, more people gotta be fucking involved with that shit.
[385:18.02]But, regardless of any of this, you need to have at least four guys in that room.
[385:33.75]We're gonna implant memes into our DNA.
[385:46.77]But we'll see what happens.
[385:48.39]All I can say is what I've just previously said.
[385:56.73]And again, I'm coming from a place of somewhat ignorance because I don't really know that much about how it is in the EU.
[386:05.06]I mean, because I don't live there.
[386:06.96]So I don't know how your day-to-day goes with stuff like that.
[386:09.52]I know there's a lot of different rules in different countries.
[386:12.26]So all I can say is I hope that it's not... I hope that it doesn't do what it says that people are afraid is going to happen.
[386:21.63]You know what I mean?
[386:23.59]Because that's a whole can of worms.
[386:35.54]You don't live in the EU?
[386:39.27]It would be really weird if I did.
[386:40.47]I'd be streaming at some weird fucking time.
[386:44.53]Oh, it's a real can of worms.
[386:48.27]But anywho, thank you to
[386:53.00]Thank you to Hans Beetz for the $3 and getting us on that topic.
[386:56.91]It is obviously a very important topic to talk about.
[387:00.91]So, I'm happy to share some of the opinions that I have.
[387:05.15]So, thank you.
[387:07.75]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1 virtual tour of Disneyland stream.
[387:10.54]When?
[387:10.76]Eh, probably like... Probably, yeah, soon.
[387:15.80]Something like that.
[387:20.54]Somewhat soon.
[387:22.69]Thank you, though.
[387:24.00]Thank you, Swiggity Swanky, again, for the one dollar.
[387:25.84]What is the scariest film or show you've ever seen?
[387:29.34]Mine is current TV news.
[387:32.08]What was the scariest film or show I've ever seen?
[387:36.99]I'm gonna sneeze and I'm gonna mute.
[387:39.41]Am I gonna make it in time?
[387:43.35]I just cut it off.
[387:44.13]I just stopped sneezing.
[387:46.75]I just forced my... Yeah, I'm good.
[387:48.45]I'm good.
[387:52.60]Scariest film or show you've ever seen.
[387:54.58]I don't know, movies don't really scare me.
[388:01.20]Because a lot of scary movies, at least that are made in the last 10 years, are guy with like a mask on or something and flashing lights and and they're right in front of the screen.
[388:15.59]I don't know, it doesn't like scare me.
[388:19.62]It's just like, oh, okay, that was like annoying.
[388:21.10]All right.
[388:26.30]I wouldn't even classify it as a jump scare, because you know it's gonna happen so far away.
[388:30.04]So, I don't know.
[388:39.45]A truly scary... Um... Actually, I will tell you, the first... Hereditary was actually really fucked up.
[388:57.07]That movie was just unsettling.
[388:58.45]So I don't know about, like, it didn't scare me.
[389:02.07]But it was unsettling.
[389:08.55]So, I mean, maybe that, like, I put that in that category of scary.
[389:12.12]That means scared, unsettled.
[389:15.68]Disturbing, yeah.
[389:20.08]If you've never seen Hereditary, it's quite a strange, wild ride.
[389:30.82]Have I seen the Sonic movie poster?
[389:32.28]Yes, I have.
[389:34.82]I don't know.
[389:35.44]Are they going... I don't know what they're even going to do with that.
[389:37.92]I have no opinion because I don't know what it is.
[389:39.62]They showed a poster.
[389:49.00]Timmy Tim, thanks for the three bucks.
[389:50.44]My dog had to be put down today.
[389:53.07]Use your Twitch money to take auto for a checkup.
[389:55.71]Thanks for cheering me up slightly today.
[389:58.51]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[390:03.29]Timmy Tim Tam, I'm terribly sorry to hear about your dog.
[390:07.46]That's a difficult thing to do.
[390:09.68]It's not easy and it won't be for a while.
[390:15.39]I just hope that your dog had a great life.
[390:18.21]That you loved him every day.
[390:19.15]Because that is losing a close friend.
[390:32.30]Our animals, our dogs, cats, whatever.
[390:35.98]They are... They're like your best friends.
[390:40.96]Otto's like one of my best friends.
[390:43.28]He just is.
[390:54.43]But... And it's devastating.
[390:59.01]And incredibly difficult.
[391:02.57]I wish you all the best.
[391:08.25]And again, I'm sorry to hear about your dog.
[391:15.01]But thank you for the $3.
[391:18.59]I really appreciate it.
[391:21.49]Thank you to Blue Comet for the $6.
[391:23.73]No message, just $6.
[391:24.85]Thank you.
[391:27.07]Banjo Boy, thanks for the $1.
[391:30.19]Hey, Jeremy, it's my birthday today, and I couldn't be happier that my name is the actual name in the rat's birthday song, which is Michael.
[391:39.03]It's also great sharing birthdays with Emily Dickinson and Raven Simone.
[391:46.17]Anyway, just wanted to say that I've loved you since, loved you and your content for like six years now, and I've been waiting for years for you to stream on my actual birthday.
[391:54.36]So having you read this on today is a dream come true.
[391:57.02]Thanks for everything.
[391:59.89]Well, happy birthday, Mike.
[392:02.89]If you're still here, if you're still watching, that was BanjoBoy88.
[392:06.89]Happy birthday, Mike.
[392:09.63]Hope it was a good one.
[392:13.80]Take care of yourself.
[392:14.48]Much love to you.
[392:16.50]Hear, hear.
[392:18.44]Flying Trolley, thanks for the $1.
[392:20.24]That is so offensive.
[392:24.04]And they spelled it out, OF-Fence-Ive.
[392:28.90]I think I ran over a fence.
[392:35.48]Thank you, Kumo, for the $1.
[392:37.20]Dermot, be honest.
[392:38.10]How many followers are just your mother making new accounts?
[392:43.33]Zero.
[392:44.19]My mother does not follow this channel.
[392:49.23]So, zero.
[392:52.19]My mother doesn't know how to do that.
[392:58.09]She's watched streams before, but she doesn't... My mother doesn't have, like, a Twitch account.
[393:06.34]Guilty.
[393:07.98]Oh, thanks, Mom.
[393:12.84]Thank you, uh, Zeno, or Zeno, for the $5.
[393:15.41]Dermot, does Star have any pets?
[393:20.65]Asking for a friend.
[393:21.45]Hope you have a good stream.
[393:24.69]Uh...
[393:27.66]I believe they have a dog.
[393:31.99]I believe so.
[393:34.01]Yes, they do.
[393:39.05]I think he's talked about this dog like a dozen times, hasn't he?
[393:41.89]Yeah, let's get a dog.
[393:47.87]Mystery solved.
[393:49.83]We'll talk about Star and Ashley.
[393:55.88]Why are you asking me?
[393:56.82]I don't know.
[394:01.20]I don't know.
[394:10.46]Hey, hey, does your friend have a dog?
[394:13.29]Uh, yeah.
[394:14.21]Alright, nice.
[394:15.69]That's just all I wanted to know.
[394:21.17]But thank you for the $5, Zeno.
[394:25.76]Thank you, one-eyed... Thank you, one-eyed ninja, for the one dollar.
[394:34.87]I just got out of the hospital two weeks ago.
[394:40.61]Uh, I'm sorry to hear that.
[394:44.52]Just got out of the hospital.
[394:46.44]Hopefully nothing serious.
[394:53.72]Hopefully you're doing well.
[395:03.76]Stay healthy.
[395:04.54]Hopefully you're doing well.
[395:06.46]Thank you for the $1.
[395:11.10]That's a good thing?
[395:11.72]No, I'm sorry that he was in the hospital to begin with.
[395:17.52]It's great that you're out of the hospital.
[395:18.74]It's amazing.
[395:26.71]Thank you.
[395:27.21]Weighted Gucci for the $5.
[395:29.79]No message.
[395:30.25]Thank you.
[395:31.80]Smelly Boy again.
[395:32.50]Thanks for a dollar.
[395:33.26]Watch Rat Movie to commemorate 1 million.
[395:36.54]It's worth it.
[395:38.46]Okay.
[395:39.58]I will watch Rat Movie 1 on stream when it hits a million views.
[395:43.13]But it's not at a million views yet, so not tonight.
[395:49.33]UpQuark.
[395:49.79]Thank you for the $10, UpQuark.
[395:51.93]Getting off of the night.
[395:56.09]It was a good way to clear my head for the finals.
[395:58.49]We touched upon the finals before.
[396:00.49]Like I said, I think I actually caught you right when you left.
[396:04.07]But good luck on your finals.
[396:06.66]Also, the present catastrophe was great.
[396:10.46]I didn't even know it was possible.
[396:11.48]I thought it was as you collected it.
[396:12.56]It just saves the fact that you collected it.
[396:18.91]I need a... Here.
[396:19.75]Here.
[396:23.09]But thank you, UpQuark, for the 10 bucks.
[396:25.17]Have a good one.
[396:25.63]Good luck on the finals.
[396:28.17]It's Russ.
[396:28.73]Thanks for the $1.
[396:29.63]You are a mini hot dog.
[396:34.19]Kyra told me thanks for the $1.
[396:35.37]Hey, German, what movies are you looking forward to recently?
[396:39.05]The new Avengers movie.
[396:43.80]And I would have said Venom.
[396:45.92]Like a couple months ago.
[396:47.86]But I did see Venom.
[396:50.40]And... I...
[396:54.45]loved that movie.
[396:57.93]I loved that movie.
[396:58.75]I thought it was great.
[397:07.73]I thought it was one of the best movies I've seen in like the last couple years.
[397:25.84]17% on Rotten Tomatoes No, all right, let me tell you let me tell you the truth here though That movie was really really it was really like stupid But I think people were a little too hard on it.
[397:42.85]I thought I think they marketed that movie completely incorrectly
[397:50.02]I don't think that movie should have been marketed as, oh, it's Venom, Spider-Man, and it's a Venom movie.
[397:57.19]No, you market that movie as like a shitty buddy cop.
[398:01.15]Why would you market that as anything else?
[398:14.35]Yeah, I mean, was it a good movie, in quotes?
[398:19.52]No.
[398:21.02]That wasn't a good movie.
[398:22.84]But I had a good time watching it.
[398:28.30]I think a lot of people were expecting something.
[398:30.36]And yes, yes, I know the movie was supposed to be rated R. And then they pulled it to PG-13.
[398:37.39]And there was a lot of scenes that they cut.
[398:39.61]And yeah, that's, I mean, come on.
[398:41.67]Whatever.
[398:42.81]They're trying to appeal to as broad of an audience as they can.
[398:51.43]What?
[398:56.18]Wait, what is going on?
[398:57.10]No stop?
[398:57.80]What?
[399:00.12]What's going on here?
[399:05.98]Sony shill?
[399:06.90]What?
[399:07.42]I just told you that the movie was bad.
[399:09.02]I just told you it was not a good movie.
[399:14.25]But bad movies that are not good does not disqualify them from being entertaining.
[399:22.39]You know what I'm saying?
[399:24.13]A movie doesn't have to be good to be worth watching.
[399:36.64]I love watching bad movies.
[399:39.82]Yeah, I mean, like, you just... If you like Venom, you liked Venom.
[399:45.19]If he didn't like Venom, then he didn't.
[399:46.91]Because, I mean, obviously, we can all probably agree the movie wasn't very good.
[399:50.83]So, you're correct.
[399:52.11]But the guy that liked Venom is not wrong.
[399:55.01]No, neither... Oh, no, don't spill another thing!
[399:57.41]That's why I had the lid on!
[399:59.15]That's why this fucking lid was on!
[400:05.66]That's why I was drinking out of it, out of the top, like a child!
[400:17.28]The movie was stupid.
[400:19.96]But I liked it.
[400:20.54]I thought it was funny.
[400:21.76]Alright, hold on.
[400:33.63]Alright, it wasn't that bad.
[400:34.59]I'm fine.
[400:35.75]It was just like a lot.
[400:36.84]It was a little bit.
[400:42.36]This is why I had the top on of this fucking thing.
[400:50.76]There wasn't that much left in it, so it went in a very easy blood splat pattern for me to clean up, but it was still aggravating.
[400:57.81]Alright.
[401:07.85]What the hell were we just talking about?
[401:19.21]Dude, dude drinks blood.
[401:21.93]No, I don't dr- yesss.
[401:24.51]No, I didn't mean to say yes.
[401:26.44]I don't drink blood.
[401:28.36]That's like, my body and brain were fighting.
[401:39.83]My brain was so desperately saying yes, and my body was like, shut the fuck up, dude.
[401:49.97]Alright, let's keep going.
[401:56.57]Anyways.
[401:58.85]Thank you, KaraToby.
[401:59.65]Thank you to Chuggy for the $10.
[402:06.94]Thank you, Chug.
[402:08.62]I forgot to leave a message when I sent you bits earlier, so here's some more.
[402:11.26]Thanks for making me laugh since the TF2 days.
[402:15.46]Love you, Jeremy.
[402:16.02]Thank you.
[402:18.97]Thank you for the $10.
[402:19.91]Thanks for being here that long.
[402:25.62]You guys are fucking awesome.
[402:26.54]Thank you.
[402:29.18]StixxRenegade, thanks for the $1.
[402:30.68]This song right here reminds me of the Grubble Gum Katamari song from the show Chowder.
[402:39.03]Well, that was two hours ago, so we need to not talk about this song.
[402:41.97]But thank you, Stixx, for the $1.
[402:43.17]Thank you, UpQuark, again, two more dollars.
[402:46.29]I guess I should get the most bits.
[402:49.97]You are in that top spot as of Monday today.
[402:52.67]New week.
[402:56.63]Thank you for the immense contributions.
[402:59.23]Thank you.
[403:01.85]Kenderman, thanks for the $1.
[403:03.15]Dear fast food franchise, I hope this letter reaches you.
[403:05.79]The burger I ordered got cold after I got home.
[403:08.05]Replace it for me.
[403:11.51]Um, okay, I will dial them immediately.
[403:16.58]Uh, thank you.
[403:18.40]Thank you, HoneyChain, for the three dollars.
[403:19.68]I wanted to make a donation to the Shpees Are We, but the website redirected me to your Twitch channel, so I guess I'll just give the money to you.
[403:29.08]Thank you for the three dollars.
[403:31.90]I appreciate it.
[403:34.32]Three bucks from HoneyChain.
[403:38.99]Thank you to Elizabeth for the one dollar.
[403:40.57]I feel the cosmos.
[403:43.07]We all do.
[403:45.85]UpQuark, again, thanks for three more dollars.
[403:50.05]And this is a link to the Rat movie.
[403:51.94]He said this is the best movie ever.
[403:53.18]Everyone should watch it.
[403:54.80]It's currently at 999,838 views.
[403:55.64]Are you serious?
[403:56.12]Thank you, UpQuark.
[404:05.29]Um... I really don't have... I really don't have that much advice because I wasn't... I wasn't going into teaching.
[404:35.38]I don't have a teaching degree.
[404:37.64]I wasn't getting my degree in education.
[404:40.84]I was doing it because it was... It was easy.
[404:46.57]Because it was.
[404:48.13]Being a sub is, you just, it's not, it's easy, but it does give you good experience.
[404:57.93]But I mean, easy in the sense that you do still have to... You still have to have control of the room.
[405:05.41]You know, you can't just be like, okay, kids, welcome to class.
[405:09.45]I don't care what you do.
[405:11.83]Go for it.
[405:12.49]You can play Fortnite on your fucking iPad for all I care.
[405:15.27]No, you have to at least have order.
[405:21.55]But, advice for teaching, I don't know if I'm in a position to give that to you.
[405:26.41]Just because I don't really have very much, because I don't have that much experience.
[405:31.25]But, like I said,
[405:33.65]Make sure you still control the room.
[405:35.85]You are the teacher.
[405:38.57]You are the authority in there.
[405:39.85]No.
[405:45.74]And if somebody, like, throws an M&M at you, confiscate it.
[405:52.04]Don't take that shit.
[405:54.21]You pick up that office phone.
[405:56.73]Pick up the fucking phone, every phone for some reason that's connected to the office.
[406:03.62]Or just, you know, pretend.
[406:05.26]Somebody does something, like, bad.
[406:06.46]Like, hey, shut up, stupid idiot teacher!
[406:08.93]Everyone laughs, and you go, okay.
[406:10.63]And you walk over, and you hold the fucking receiver down, and you pick the phone up.
[406:14.53]Yeah, I've got a, I've got a, uh, I've got a student here that's starting to act up a little bit here.
[406:19.74]Do you have any room down there in the office?
[406:22.52]And they're like, oh, shit, he just picked up the, he just picked up the phone.
[406:26.00]And then you put it back, and you let go, and... Yeah, that's right, everybody sit down.
[406:40.87]But then be careful, because if you accidentally lift your finger up, you do call the office, and then you- the phone- you'll get a phone call, some- they'll call you back, and be like, what happened?
[406:49.83]Oh, well, I was, uh... I was trying to do a thing where I made the students- Be careful.
[406:56.21]Only use that tactic when completely necessary.
[407:02.49]You were one of those subs?
[407:06.27]No, I was very, very professional.
[407:07.81]I'm just fucking around.
[407:11.04]Be professional.
[407:13.94]Take care of your students.
[407:15.94]And have order in the room.
[407:17.50]Best advice I can give.
[407:24.01]But thank you, FH Gregory.
[407:25.39]Best of luck to you.
[407:27.79]Uh, Dinky... DinkyDuper, thanks for the one dollar.
[407:36.72]Hey Jerma, I saw you at Walmart yesterday.
[407:40.39]I was too afraid to come up to you and say hi since you seem so distracted by the ongoing Xbox deals.
[407:46.03]Since you're something of a Microsoft gamer yourself, on a more serious note though, hope you have a great night.
[407:52.16]What?
[407:53.98]The eck?
[407:54.56]I was distracted by the Xbox deals.
[408:03.29]How would you get distracted by a sign that tells you how much percent off the Xbox is?
[408:14.00]You go, oh, like, 10% off.
[408:15.94]Okay.
[408:17.68]What, do you have to examine the sign?
[408:23.01]Thank you, DinkyDuper.
[408:23.97]Thank you, Mizu.
[408:25.87]Thank you, Mizu, for the $10.
[408:29.08]Thanks for all the streams and joops.
[408:32.20]Well, thank you for the joops.
[408:34.72]You're the guys that make them.
[408:37.50]I've never had a full Jupiter in my own chat, ever.
[408:41.22]I've never done it.
[408:41.98]I can't do it.
[408:43.57]You guys are the guys making... You guys are the guys.
[408:46.81]You guys are the ones doing the Jupiters.
[408:49.01]Thank you.
[408:52.69]Thank you, Sage.
[408:55.25]Did you buy the Pikachu socks in the Wailord plushie?
[408:58.69]You'll find out in LEGO Week.
[409:01.36]Arch Woody, thanks for the $1.
[409:03.30]Hey, German, please say take care, everyone, at the end of the stream and play Bloom Bombs.
[409:09.92]I would.
[409:10.24]We already did that, though.
[409:10.96]We did that, like... We already did that bit.
[409:14.36]I'll say take care, everyone, because I do say that.
[409:20.70]There, I'll put it on.
[409:21.89]I'll put it on at the end.
[409:24.11]Now let's get away from that music and put on the original music.
[409:28.35]It's a good bit to repeat.
[409:29.87]Maybe I will.
[409:34.55]Uh, King Comrade, thanks for the one dollar.
[409:36.58]Uh, host someone playing Smash Brothers or Dark Souls.
[409:47.96]Um...
[409:52.69]End of the stream, boys.
[409:54.11]Yeah.
[409:54.53]I mean, this is the end of the stream.
[410:00.79]Now I'll play Smash Bros.
[410:02.11]and you'll see MY stream!
[410:03.70]I'm just kidding.
[410:06.20]Remember I didn't host people?
[410:07.22]I hosted Vinny, like, four days ago.
[410:09.70]I hosted Italics, like, a week before that.
[410:22.29]I host people.
[410:25.79]One host per week.
[410:37.41]He's a selfish maniac.
[410:42.29]He's doing the bell.
[410:43.39]Don't make me, don't make me do it.
[410:45.95]Do you forget about this one?
[410:48.68]I'll bring it back if you don't calm down.
[410:59.32]Shit he's bane posting There's still people that are on the peak mic this stream has been going for seven hours and Within 12 minutes we were talking about peaking the microphone and it's set seven hours later peak mic Almost a whole day has gone by

[411:44.26]Thank you UpQuark for the $1.
[411:45.40]Oh, I forgot to tell you, this stream is sponsored by Flextape.
[411:49.40]Flextape can... Okay.
[411:58.08]I don't do sponsored ads.
[412:00.50]Thank you Shooshroom for the $1.

[412:24.34]Dr. Steen, thanks for the $1.

[412:28.16]The other half will be struggling in an ice age.
[412:34.00]Why have I never heard about this old god that's underneath the fucking earth?
[412:38.02]What?
[412:45.02]Alright, that's... I'm gonna have to look this up after the stream.
[412:49.79]Ayla, thank you Ayla for the one dollar.
[412:52.73]First dono here, long time fan.
[412:55.29]Just found out that the Fairly OddParents intro song sounds like gin and tonic.
[413:01.40]and Red Roses from the Katamari OST.
[413:04.41]And the song after it is called Wanda Wanda.
[413:06.61]This changes everything.
[413:08.47]Also, the Beep Boop song is Angel's Gift.
[413:16.80]Let's listen to it.
[413:22.84]This is, let's see, fairly odd appearance.
[414:06.83]It is kind of similar.
[414:07.75]Did you say blues?
[414:12.52]Alright, turn it off.
[414:19.60]That's pretty interesting stuff.
[414:20.92]Thank you.
[414:21.56]Thanks for coming in and donating for the first time.
[414:24.50]It's never required, but thank you nonetheless.
[414:29.69]Dr. Steen again for the $1.
[414:31.01]Do an improv stream.
[414:32.25]Form an improv group and do an hour-long show in a comedy club.
[414:38.49]No.
[414:40.23]Up Quark again with another dollar.
[414:42.03]What do you think about having a workout stream where you lead a workout session?
[414:46.02]Embarrassing.
[414:48.60]Maybe four or five years ago.
[414:51.12]I would have killed it if this was 2012.
[414:53.56]I would have been that guy on Twitch that everyone's like, holy shit, dude, this guy's sick.
[415:00.96]This guy knows exactly what the fuck he's doing.
[415:02.58]He knows exactly what he's talking about and look at him.
[415:07.06]Oh, it would have been awesome.
[415:09.83]But, no.
[415:10.57]Sorry.
[415:12.33]I got, like, gross.
[415:16.60]I peaked over 31, 32 years old, and I got gross.
[415:28.89]So, I can't do a workout stream now.
[415:31.87]I'll run out of breath.
[415:34.88]and I'll struggle to lift weights that I could have thrown over my head five, six, seven years ago.
[415:47.11]But thank you.
[415:47.87]Thank you to StyxRenegade for the $1.
[415:49.25]You know what movie is unsettling?
[415:51.49]Final Destination.
[415:52.87]Every time I watch clips of those movies, I refuse to leave the house all day.
[415:59.25]Yeah, that is a really weird...
[416:02.50]It is a strain.
[416:03.48]That stays with you.
[416:04.30]Final Destination does stay with you.
[416:06.68]Because all of a sudden you start looking around and you're like, hold on, there's a plug right there.
[416:11.20]Oh, but I've got to plug in my iPhone.
[416:15.78]But what happens if like today, did I like cheat death?
[416:19.22]If I plug my iPhone charger in, am I going to get like electrocuted?
[416:22.90]I don't know.
[416:24.10]Somebody else can do it.
[416:31.99]I thought they were too cheesy.
[416:32.99]Well, they are, but the thought of it is still scary.
[416:39.36]It's a bad Smash map.
[416:41.64]You mean it's the only Smash map.
[416:46.42]Sorry, one of like three.
[416:54.96]No, that's not... I don't know if that's so true anymore.
[416:57.83]This is probably a good solid, like, 8 to 10 community maps.
[417:02.19]I was gonna say competitive maps.
[417:08.92]Items on?
[417:09.42]All items on on high.
[417:18.29]Community steps.
[417:19.09]There's some really good community steps on there.
[417:23.94]But, thank you, Stix Renegade.
[417:25.98]Thank you, Clueless Sniper, for $2.
[417:27.82]No message, but thank you.
[417:29.96]Elizabeth, thanks for $1 soon.
[417:32.15]Your death is coming up, Jeremiah, and by that I mean in your bio-ink death.
[417:35.67]Make sure to go to church.
[417:37.39]January 23rd.
[417:38.33]That is coming up.
[417:44.83]23rd?
[417:45.25]Was January 19th?
[417:46.09]January 23rd?
[417:46.91]What day was it?
[417:48.75]That came up quick.
[417:51.65]Okay.
[417:53.49]Now you got the final destination shit.
[417:55.25]Okay, this is weird to me, man.
[417:57.55]Somebody talking about final destination.
[418:00.85]And then another person talking about, hey, that date's coming up.
[418:07.32]I'm going to wear oven mitts on January 19th and through the 23rd.
[418:13.62]I'm just going to wear oven mitts and hockey pads.
[418:17.26]Just sit in my room.
[418:26.84]And Pikachu socks.
[418:27.88]Yeah, that's true.
[418:30.46]But thank you for the reminder.
[418:32.58]Thank you, RiskyXD for the $1.
[418:35.30]Hey, first time on your actual stream from YouTube.
[418:37.28]Been watching for a long time.
[418:39.06]Always a big fan of your content.
[418:41.30]Welcome.
[418:42.68]Welcome to your first actual stream.
[418:53.57]Hope you enjoy yourself, hope you stick around.
[418:56.13]Thanks for coming out.
[418:59.91]Thank you to Dragon Breath for the $1.
[419:01.79]Jeremiah, I can't believe you lied to us before the stream about having BTTV.
[419:06.09]You betrayed my trust and I'll never forgive you for this.
[419:09.14]By the way, cool stream, man.
[419:10.30]I love Katamari.
[419:11.52]Have a spunky night.
[419:14.76]I did say in the chat, pre-stream chat, that I got better Twitch TV.
[419:21.56]I think I've said that like five different times.
[419:25.05]Don't you, like, you gotta remember something.
[419:26.11]The pre-stream me in the chat, I just write anything.
[419:31.27]I'm like a weirdo when I just have, like, a text.
[419:33.57]I could just, I'm writing whatever the hell is happening.
[419:36.43]I have no idea.
[419:37.13]I could, I write just random shit in the chat.
[419:42.46]I don't know why I do it.
[419:43.44]It's, I just, I don't know.
[419:45.78]If you give me a text box and a keyboard, it's just, I don't even know what's gonna happen.
[419:53.91]What was that in the background?
[419:54.87]I'm looking to see how many views the Rat Movie has.
[420:00.97]It has 999,873.
[420:01.41]So, still a little bit off.
[420:09.60]You barely tweet?
[420:12.46]Yeah, but that's not a text box.
[420:13.84]That's my phone.
[420:19.88]I need like a text box with a keyboard.
[420:29.27]I'll, oh, yeah, the, the, that move, that's, it may be at a million views.
[420:33.80]It's probably gonna take a few hours to update, but until it shows, sorry.
[420:39.08]And finally, thank you UpQuark for the one dollar.
[420:40.96]Thanks for putting up with me tonight.
[420:42.94]See you another day.

[420:55.57]Let's kill the music, because this is important.
[421:00.08]There was a clip of one of the green screen streams.
[421:05.33]One of the green screen videos.
[421:07.75]And it had a lot of upvotes.
[421:11.11]And one of the things in the thread, what people were talking about, wow, what, like, is his whole community, like, content creators?
