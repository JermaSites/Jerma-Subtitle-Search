[08:00.91]That's important.
[08:01.83]Alright, this is where I left off before.
[08:03.21]This is the tricky, stupid, dumb part that I hated.
[08:05.45]I may have been a little tired.
[08:07.55]That's why I hated it.
[08:08.51]I remember now.
[08:09.21]Now I remember I hate this.
[08:11.65]Because if you get sprayed with water, it takes off more health than getting shot by a gun.

[11:24.93]Here we go.
[11:28.63]Wait, it's behind me, right?
[11:43.68]What is this hit tracking?
[11:45.14]I only have two club.
[11:49.02]I can't see the word.
[12:00.64]Magazine.

[12:12.78]Okay.
[12:13.42]Fire extinguisher.
[12:15.19]I was already at, like, one health pack by this point.
[12:17.97]So...
[12:23.70]That zombie guy is not going to come down here, is he?
[12:33.25]I don't think so.
[12:34.03]Not that I remember.
[12:34.65]What the hell is this guy doing?
[12:46.25]Nothing behind me, right?
[12:47.05]I only have... Okay, this is bad.
[12:49.83]I... Is there any...
[12:53.78]Okay, give me my rocket launcher.
[13:02.37]I don't understand what happened there.
[13:04.17]That didn't hit the corner of the... What did it do?
[13:07.87]What happened there?
[13:08.45]What happened there?
[13:09.07]What happened?
[13:09.47]I don't understand.
[13:39.31]I'm so mad right now.
[13:45.73]This is sad.
[13:47.01]Yeah, I know.
[13:47.91]That was bullshit.
[13:50.33]That thing has a hitbox as big as the screen you're seeing right now.
[13:55.20]I'm almost there, though.
[14:00.38]I have to wait because this is what screwed me up last time.
[14:03.94]Shoot this.
[14:06.48]Wait.
[14:06.95]Okay.
[14:08.19]There are aliens that come out from this guy's body.
[14:11.29]Right?
[14:11.97]Did I kill it?
[14:13.31]Did I?
[14:15.85]No, I didn't.
[14:24.16]I remember this part.
[14:27.38]It has to die on screen.
[14:29.98]Yes, I know.
[14:31.06]I get it.
[14:31.92]Just like every Game of Thrones character.
[14:34.09]If they don't die on screen, then they didn't fucking die.
[14:36.49]That was good, right?
[14:46.90]Whatever.
[14:52.44]Uh, how the fu- How am I gonna do this?
[14:54.14]Remember this happened last time?
[14:56.64]What do I-
[15:03.31]I don't know why it's not dead.
[15:11.51]This is the worst thing.
[15:13.12]This is one of the top five worst things I've ever done in a video game.
[15:30.94]I can't... What am I supposed to do?
[15:34.72]I softlocked myself because I shot the barrels before.
[15:37.04]But if I came over here to get it in my view, I would have gotten blown up by this barrel because I would have to stand right here.
[15:57.28]And they did...
[16:00.56]What the fuck?
[16:03.54]What the fuck?
[16:27.25]Shoot the- Why does it not fire?! !
[16:33.67]Dude, this gun is- doesn't make any fucking sense.
[16:39.95]You gotta be kidding me.
[16:48.41]I can't even go around him!
[16:53.96]This is the stu- this is the stupidest thing I've ever done.
[16:59.60]By the way, the shotgun...
[17:01.63]shoots 8% of the time that you click the button.
[17:07.35]Like, when I click to shoot the shotgun, it happens every 10th click.
[17:23.57]I ain't fucking around with this dumbass shit, I'll tell you.
[17:26.63]Not on a hard.
[17:34.98]Alright, I want to do a test here.
[17:36.19]Here we go.
[17:36.55]Ready?
[17:37.13]Shotgun.
[17:40.41]It works now.
[17:45.33]So when I'm clicking doing this in an actual fight, why does it not fire?
[17:51.57]Does it make any sense?
[17:59.05]So go back and watch the... Every time I've used a shotgun in a fight and you hear...
[18:06.45]And it doesn't do anything.
[18:09.91]You will physically hear the clicking.
[18:12.03]Like this.
[18:12.42]It just happened.
[18:26.08]Now it just shot like four times instantly.
[18:36.02]Okay, I... That's why I can't- you can't use a shotgun.
[18:43.30]The shotgun sucks.
[18:48.13]Alright.
[18:49.43]What- what- big bits?
[18:50.71]Did I miss bits?
[18:58.11]Wipe your tears with money.
[19:01.38]I don't even see them on here.
[19:03.40]It was 20,000?
[19:05.86]Wait, 200 fucking dollars came in?
[19:07.51]Are you kidding me?
[19:10.41]No, is this... Oh, I'm getting baited?
[19:20.15]Why do I have to go all the way from... Why can't you have a save point anywhere?
[19:24.42]In between here and there?
[19:27.30]You throw so much junk at that stairwell.
[19:42.44]Dude, I almost want to go get like a hack to fucking save state the game.
[19:46.38]This is one of those fucking stupid ass games that has like segments like this.
[19:57.22]Report him.
[19:57.70]Report.
[19:57.98]Don't report me.
[20:03.48]It's a fake gamer.
[20:08.63]Get out of the fucking way.
[20:13.34]Oh, this guy's a stupid-ass gamer.
[20:15.00]I went the wrong way.
[20:24.45]So I'm not even gonna... How do I do this without wasting ammo and shit here?
[20:29.21]I thought that was a rumor.
[20:41.44]Because there's this guy in here...
[20:45.99]So I'm gonna... I guess I could just make the... No, because then you get spawned.
[20:50.01]I have to just kill this guy now.
[20:53.50]I actually missed $150.
[20:54.86]Did I?
[20:56.76]Seriously?
[21:01.60]Come on up.
[21:05.66]Alright, run.
[21:10.29]I'm so glad there's no stamina in this game.
[21:23.88]Watch it.
[21:24.60]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[21:30.95]He still doesn't know to shoot them and then burn them?
[21:34.56]I thought that was only for, uh... Like, the humanoid ones, or is that all of them?
[21:45.29]It's hard to tell because there's no feedback when you shoot anything.
[21:52.59]Bullets just kind of disappear into enemies.
[21:54.67]There's barely any feedback.
[21:57.15]You only get feedback from this.
[21:59.89]Is he still alive?
[22:09.17]What are you doing?
[22:23.17]Dead?
[22:24.09]Dead.
[22:24.47]Okay.
[22:30.90]Alright, let's try this again.
[22:31.80]This time when I get down to that part with the barrels, I'm not just gonna shoot the barrels.
[22:37.42]I'm gonna wait till I can see it, but it's gonna kill me.
[22:39.20]I don't know.
[22:46.55]Not too baited.
[23:05.41]Alright, here we go.
[23:12.29]What?
[23:12.61]Who said that?
[23:15.38]What?
[23:15.64]Can I go?
[23:17.72]Oh yeah, this part.
[23:41.24]Shit.
[23:47.82]Alright, give me... More?
[23:49.66]There's more.
[23:50.94]How?
[23:56.06]Okay.
[23:58.42]Give me a weapon!
[23:59.64]I'll give you a weapon.
[24:01.23]We'll see if we can use you.
[24:02.93]Stop moving.
[24:03.71]Get over here.
[24:04.47]Get over here.
[24:05.07]Stop running up there.
[24:06.97]Don't be so stupid.
[24:08.88]Why are you going over there?
[24:10.04]Follow me over here.
[24:11.06]Oh, I hate you.
[24:11.70]He just stands up there.
[24:31.73]Oh, it's getting hard.
[24:33.09]It's getting hard for me to not.
[24:37.41]Just pretend I beat the game.
[24:51.26]What?
[24:57.48]These guys just spawned.
[25:01.86]He is infected.
[25:03.66]He's infected immediately.
[25:05.72]And I can't run away because I'm gonna get sprayed.
[25:16.27]No, I remember shooting him in the head with a rifle.
[25:20.25]Oh, great.
[25:20.89]This is where it gets all fucked up now.
[25:33.81]I actually remember shooting this guy in the head with a rifle.
[25:37.69]I mean, it was like four or five days ago, but I remember shooting him in the head with a rifle when he was up there.
[25:42.83]And he turned.
[25:43.23]Oh my god, this is so bad.
[26:12.65]For me to Because they spawn here and you can't I can't go this way because of this and I can't go this way because this So the fucking claw monsters just keep spawning here jumping on your face.
[26:29.28]And if you burn them you burn yourself Shitty as fucking long spiral hallway.
[26:37.80]Oh
[26:41.03]Oh, wait, what's that?
[26:42.07]What happened?
[26:43.49]I walked five feet.
[26:44.37]Did we spawn underneath my body?
[27:14.12]Can I walk now, please?
[27:20.25]Where is it?
[27:31.65]How the fuck am I gonna kill the gigantic thing that takes up the whole hall?
[27:39.29]That shit ain't gonna happen.
[27:40.68]How am I gonna do that?
[27:46.45]The guy that takes up the whole thing.
[27:47.89]I gotta run backwards and burn him, but I'm gonna get burnt by the fucking steam.
[28:10.14]Okay.
[28:11.70]I'm not gonna blow this up.
[28:13.99]Can I spawn that guy without... I don't know.
[28:16.15]I'm going to go very, very slowly.
[28:29.26]Alright.
[28:31.62]This one... I remember this one.
[28:33.16]This one was stupid too.
[28:36.41]So.
[28:38.87]I have to do this up all the way up there.
[28:43.02]without having it somehow hit this one, or this one.
[28:48.73]I don't, I don't, did you see what that grenade did?
[28:51.53]That grenade went like a hitman's suitcase over here.
[29:40.31]That doesn't make any sense.
[30:08.09]He looks like the greedy runner.
[30:11.05]I just... I don't... Okay, so now, what are you supposed to do here?
[30:16.85]I don't even have any health packs left.
[30:19.24]I'm so fucked.
[30:28.96]Just the casino.
[30:31.41]I'm so fucked right now.
[30:32.65]Like, I don't know what they even expect you to do here.
[30:35.63]Because...
[30:37.70]If I stand over there, it doesn't destroy it.
[30:41.51]If I stand over here, I die from this.
[30:45.03]But I have to... I don't get it.
[30:47.89]Use a grenade and run?
[30:48.89]It's going to shoot at me and blow up the... It's going to blow this up.
[30:53.89]Sniper rifle doesn't work.
[30:59.42]The sniper rifle doesn't do anything.
[31:08.20]Now I'm in trouble.
[31:10.38]What?
[31:12.00]It's... It's... If I shoot the barrels here, I can't see that... This is just a rock and a hard place.
[31:37.73]but I can't shoot them from over here because it doesn't blow up the gun.
[31:46.48]Don't reload the save, why not?
[31:50.70]That's not a new level.
[31:53.30]Is it, is that, wait, is it a new, new game?
[31:56.80]Save the medic.
[31:58.51]No, you can't save the medic.
[32:00.21]He's fake from the beginning.
[32:01.55]I'm gonna prove it right now.
[32:04.45]I'm gonna shoot him in the head the second I see him.
[32:11.79]The Medic is pretending, yeah.
[32:15.67]Let me just see what happens if I do this too.
[32:17.90]If I die in there, can I just restart the level?
[32:33.44]Uh, Bob-Boy!
[32:34.26]This one- Hey, Bob-Boy!
[32:36.02]This one's for you.
[32:38.53]Thanks to the five community subs, Bob-Boy.
[32:48.84]Alright, so if I die in here, like if I just die right now, will I restart level and start here?
[33:02.87]Okay.
[33:09.31]Here we go.
[33:11.33]I'm going to stun this guy.
[33:13.11]Just because I'm going to.
[33:22.00]okay oh that would why did you take so long to do that so
[34:00.15]Okay, for the love of God, please.
[34:11.26]Jex is online?
[34:13.92]He hates GIFs.
[34:16.86]No, I don't hate GIFs.
[34:17.88]I love GIFs.
[34:18.60]Thank you for everybody for the GIFs.
[34:29.24]The current any% speedrun of this game is 40 minutes.
[34:34.67]That's pretty ridiculous.
[34:37.69]Okay, I gotta... Just get in there now.
[34:48.01]I wonder how fucked up it is.
[34:48.93]Yeah, I wonder how many, like, actual, like, skips there are.
[34:56.61]Shoot!
[35:07.23]Let's go.
[35:07.75]I'm gonna make sure you don't get touched.
[35:12.26]Stay, stay, stay!
[35:13.18]Come here.
[35:19.78]You and me, let's go.
[35:31.62]Did he get touched?
[35:32.42]He didn't.
[35:38.36]By the way, that's just a dice roll if he's gonna get hit or not, because you can't kill three things like that in five seconds.
[35:44.30]Follow me.
[35:44.64]Let's go.
[35:45.62]Are you gonna do this thing?
[35:47.50]Are you gonna do this stupid thing?
[35:58.40]They're getting hit by the steam.
[36:00.90]Okay, let's go.
[36:02.62]Follow me.
[36:04.10]If you turn right now, I'm gonna be so pissed off.
[36:09.12]Wait, watch out.
[36:10.20]Oh my god, you're a medic.
[36:14.71]Please don't just turn and make this a complete disaster.
[36:20.57]Please.
[36:25.73]He's gonna fucking turn right when it matters.
[36:33.30]Save game?
[36:35.77]There is no quick save.
[36:58.85]I needed to test.
[36:59.43]Somebody said to test that and see if you can just give the body.
[37:07.52]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[37:11.50]That was a joke.
[37:12.20]That was a... That was a joke.
[37:17.72]That is... I actually just got joked on right there.
[37:20.12]Don't stand there like me.
[37:21.34]You got it.
[37:28.03]You got it.
[37:28.35]You got to kill that.
[37:30.01]Kill it!
[37:30.77]What are you doing?
[37:31.63]Shoot it!
[37:33.84]Oh, come on.
[37:34.80]Are you fucking... That's why he wasn't shooting.
[37:37.56]No, he's... It's not real.
[37:39.08]He's... This motherfucker's infected the whole time.
[37:42.46]He just wasn't even shooting the gun.
[37:54.91]The medic is scripted.
[37:56.68]I knew it.
[37:57.38]I... Oh my god, I hate this so much more than anything.
[38:01.94]You know like the like like ball bald because mad whatever the fuck that meme is.
[38:06.28]Oh, it's happening right now You
[38:30.14]You shot me with a shotgun from that far away and it did that much damage.
[38:37.16]Who are you?
[39:01.06]I hate this game
[39:34.84]I got it, right?
[39:36.91]I got it.
[39:37.47]I got it.
[39:37.77]I had to have.
[39:39.39]I had to have.
[39:39.79]You saw the explosion.
[39:43.02]I was even past it.
[39:44.02]Like, I, this is just, why is this in the game?
[39:47.76]It's just there to be annoying.
[39:56.67]dude it even made the explosion on it it even did the it exploded thing and it's still there you have to be within like 10 feet for those things to be destroyed what on Earth what on Earth would what on Earth
[40:21.24]What were they thinking?
[40:23.34]Because now I have to run forward and spawn all the enemies and then shoot a grenade and then get swarmed.
[40:34.85]This has to be another way to do this.
[40:37.89]That has to be.
[40:43.98]Can I like bait the swarm?
[41:15.10]This is fucking dumb.
[41:19.58]I can't even aim down.
[41:20.56]This is dumb.
[41:35.74]D-U-M-M.
[42:22.05]Is this just never gonna stop?
[42:23.95]Because every time I run for it, the big guy is right there and then he blocks, you can't run by him.
[42:29.24]So I have to turn around.
[42:39.90]You can, I can't.
[42:43.77]It's scripted.
[42:48.86]What kind of script is this?
[43:20.63]Just running down with the SMG don't work.
[43:22.67]I tried it four days ago.
[43:27.61]Rare Pepe Body Lotion just gave five.
[43:29.59]Thank you for the five subs.
[43:30.79]Rare Pepe Body Lotion.
[43:32.34]Appreciate it.
[43:33.00]And Don't Be That Way also gave five subs.
[43:38.26]Is there like a way just to exploit this part?
[43:43.24]Because this feels, this feels like a weight.
[43:46.04]This feels like a thousand pound weight on my chest.
[44:02.24]I don't want to do this all again.
[44:22.89]How do you cheat?
[44:24.59]I would love to cheat right now.
[44:36.05]Ask your older brother.
[44:36.95]I just don't know... No, no, no, wait.
[44:51.31]MaxGames was a mistake.
[44:53.65]Thank you, MaxGames.
[44:58.03]I'm putting this on easy.
[45:00.18]I don't care.
[45:00.56]Yeah, I'm putting this on the easiest difficulty.
[45:05.36]I don't- I think I- I think I had care about my ego taking a hit from not being able to go through this fucking bullshit staircase and the thing.
[45:17.66]In fact, I don't even know what the hell this does.
[45:28.97]This is like auto-aim, right?
[45:31.33]I have no idea.
[45:39.00]This is actually making it harder.
[45:50.92]This is worse.
[45:54.12]It's trying to aim at them.
[46:06.78]I'm so close to the end of this game.
[46:08.22]I just want to beat it.
[46:17.41]It's trying.
[46:37.65]Heal me.
[46:38.55]I'm not using a mouth pack.
[46:41.95]What just happened to me?
[46:43.57]What happened?
[46:44.27]I just landed and got hurt.
[46:54.86]We got company.
[47:01.90]Take him down.
[47:25.42]Remember, this is all canon.
[47:28.87]Oh, I would retroactively get rid of that.
[47:41.11]You coming out, or what?
[48:05.55]This game is torturing Jeremy.
[48:11.29]I mean, I was having fun.
[48:13.91]It was like eight and a half hours of a fun game.
[48:18.11]And then this part is just stupid.
[48:29.20]It was.
[48:29.76]It was!
[48:31.76]This is Mario- This is not Mario Tennis Levels.
[48:38.32]I haven't- I haven't, like, talked shit to somebody I don't know online.
[48:44.14]Just watch a playthrough to figure it out.
[48:49.38]I shouldn't have to watch, like, the speedrun where the guy has played this game four thousand times to be able to know how to playthrough once.
[48:59.03]What?
[48:59.27]I shouldn't be able just to do it.
[49:06.20]Alright, let's go.
[49:21.77]Let's do it again.
[49:25.94]Now comes some of the toughest fighting you'll do in the entire game.
[49:28.56]When you drop out of the ductwork, Cohen will run by or just behind you.
[49:31.72]He'll run all the way up to the top of the ramps.
[49:33.28]When you hit the ground, quickly give him a weapon to follow him.
[49:35.20]Once you reach the top, have him follow you and fight any troopers on the ramps.
[49:38.45]Yeah, but that's... That's what I'm... I did that already.
[49:45.69]But then I have to kill him.
[49:47.17]And that sucks.
[49:49.87]I literally need him until he turns and it goes to shit.
[50:08.60]What are you fucking aiming at, game?
[50:18.66]Auto-aim in a tunnel.
[50:23.30]Holy fuck.
[50:27.48]Get over here.
[50:28.18]Don't run by me.
[50:30.63]Shut up.
[50:32.37]Take a machine gun.
[50:33.47]Now.
[50:34.27]Let's go.
[50:35.99]Follow me.
[50:36.69]Fight.
[50:37.73]FIGHT!
[50:51.00]Shoot.
[50:54.22]Heal the fuck out of me right now.
[50:55.62]Heal me.
[50:59.66]Heal me.
[51:01.76]Heal me.
[51:02.92]You're a medic.
[51:04.00]Please.
[51:04.68]He's already turned.
[51:05.72]It's already over.
[51:09.60]He's just standing still like an asshole.
[51:15.16]Hold still and I'll fix you up.
[51:38.83]Hurry up, go.
[51:45.19]Help me, please.
[51:46.37]Where are you?
[51:57.20]Where are you?
[52:01.64]Get over here.
[52:10.38]He's turned.
[52:12.37]Heal me, please.
[52:13.05]I have enough bullets.
[52:22.59]Fight!
[52:22.83]Fight!
[52:43.17]Fight!
[52:44.41]What is even hurting you that much?
[52:46.09]What the fuck just happened?
[53:19.34]It all goes to shit here every time.
[53:24.72]He's dead.
[53:25.72]Good.
[53:28.18]Give me my gun back.
[53:28.96]Do you have any health packs on you or anything?
[53:37.80]He doesn't stand up, right?
[53:42.34]Steam.
[53:54.33]I'm going back to the shotgun.
[53:57.35]Okay, now it's this part.
[53:59.39]I get swarmed, right?
[54:00.41]No, it's these guys.
[54:18.38]Just aimed.
[54:42.98]Trying to beat this.
[54:43.92]I just got so mad at that person that beeped.
[55:04.19]That was like a, fuck did you say?
[55:11.35]What happened?
[55:15.17]That was a direct hit.
[55:21.51]Somebody fucking help me.
[55:24.08]Somebody help me.
[55:25.52]Somebody help me.
[55:31.22]Three hits needed.
[55:32.32]No, that's not true.
[55:34.53]That's not true.
[55:38.99]That can't be true.
[55:39.93]No, you can't.
[55:40.49]That can't be true.
[55:44.77]If I don't do it here, I'm watching a YouTube video.
[55:49.35]Okay, this is the part where it goes to shit every single fucking time.
[55:53.59]We're gonna change... We're gonna change that.
[55:57.00]I'm going to... Okay.
[56:00.92]We're gonna make a wall of fire.
[56:03.36]Right here.
[56:04.50]I'm going to... I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[56:09.56]I get... I run?
[56:11.64]No, I don't have any idea.
[56:12.98]Should I watch a video...
[56:16.96]Timed that so well it's like it's the hitbox is so big and it doesn't stop I did I didn't do anything wrong there I'm watching a video What's this called the thing stupid staircase The thing
[56:45.72]Staircase.
[56:47.97]What would you call it?
[56:48.69]Winding staircase?
[56:54.99]Uh, the thing staircase game.
[56:59.45]Spiral?
[57:02.60]The thing spiral staircase.
[57:11.60]Somebody already has a video.
[57:17.46]It's a ramp.
[57:19.98]Okay, The Sims 4 is... I'm getting The Sims 4.

[57:26.86]What a brilliant fucking mind you have.
[57:29.50]Seriously.
[57:30.12]I can't alt-tab.
[57:32.08]What a brilliant mind.
[57:33.96]I'm going to open up the chat, but I'm going to be logged in twice.
[57:36.34]Am I going to get like, you've been hacked?
[57:44.97]Can I do this?
[57:48.79]Okay.
[57:49.39]Alright, let me see it.
[57:58.29]Can I even open this?
[58:00.99]Okay, I'm opening it.
[58:04.61]Let me just take a look.
[58:06.52]The thing, any percent- No, I don't want the speedrun!
[58:09.22]I don't want the speedrun!
[58:11.86]I don't even know where to look!
[58:14.24]Okay, hold on, I'm looking.
[58:18.03]Did you just hear that sigh?
[58:19.07]Okay, so... He shoots... He just shoots everything.
[58:43.56]And then he... And then he gets angry.
[58:46.36]And this is a speedrunner, by the way.
[58:48.69]See?
[58:50.81]Oh, shit.
[58:51.27]Let me do that.
[58:58.74]Shooting, shooting, shooting, shooting, shooting.
[59:00.36]Can you not fucking do that?
[59:03.14]Stealing... No, I'm just trying to see what to do from an expert.
[59:09.33]Wait, where's he aiming at?
[59:10.15]Alright, he runs by.
[59:12.17]Alright, what do you do here?
[59:17.76]You can shoot them.
[59:19.23]You can shoot them.
[59:21.07]You can shoot them.
[59:23.35]You can shoot them.
[59:25.14]But there's no feedback that that's possible.
[59:28.06]Are you kidding me?
[59:29.24]Don't even say that.
[59:30.34]Don't tell me this is real.
[59:44.64]I shot that with a hunting rifle like 10 fucking times.
[59:47.76]There's no spark.
[59:49.10]There's no feedback.
[59:50.52]Your bullets disappear into the wall just like they do over here.
[59:57.37]There's feedback here.
[60:00.05]Unbelievable.
[60:01.41]Okay.
[60:04.29]I'm gonna go bait the fucking big guy.
[60:09.11]Let's go.
[60:36.59]Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck!
[60:46.90]Stop steaming!
[60:47.94]Yes!
[60:59.63]Yes!
[61:08.73]Alright, fucking hold on.
[61:15.28]Where is it?
[61:15.62]Where is it?
[61:15.90]Where is it?
[61:23.04]What the fuck?
[61:43.64]No!
[61:44.54]Oh!
[61:44.74]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[62:05.39]There's another one.
[62:15.20]Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[62:16.36]Just go, just go.
[62:18.64]Is it dead?
[62:19.06]Is it dead?
[62:19.78]I'm gonna pass out.
[62:35.91]I think I'm having a heart attack.
[62:41.28]Okay, I think I'm fine.
[62:42.34]This is a small heart attack.
[62:54.41]Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god!
[63:20.80]Swallow it. It was bad, swallow it tho.
[63:26.05]It's like when a pitcher gives up a fucking grand slam, you don't just like roll around on the mound like, no, I didn't do it.
[63:36.26]No, you just, you go, next batter, next batter, next batter.
[63:44.29]Why does that room have two, I have to, oh, just go, next batter.
[63:55.10]But at least now I know I can do that.
[63:59.00]Oh, fuck.
[64:00.10]I was so close.
[64:01.52]It was over, but they just... There's two of them.
[64:04.18]And I was... I guess I could have shot, but they would have shot me.
[64:06.95]I don't know.
[64:07.29]I don't know.
[64:08.69]I'm sad.
[64:09.85]No.
[64:10.17]Next batter!
[64:37.66]Shotgun works now it's because I'm holding it down.
[64:39.24]I'm not pressing it It's hard to get over what just happened
[64:52.82]After all the bullshit and all the dumb shit, it's hard for me to get over this.
[64:58.29]I'm trying.
[64:58.81]I'm just trying to get back there so I can just pretend it never happened.
[65:02.59]I'm gonna try.
[65:21.74]For Lydia, thanks for the 10 community subs and your boy 10 community subs.
[65:25.08]Back to back.
[65:25.52]Thanks, guys.
[65:27.20]Durba, do you know that you sucks at video games?
[65:29.32]That's not gonna... Okay, when you let up like four grand slams in a row, if somebody in the stands goes, you suck!
[65:37.19]It doesn't do anything.
[65:38.37]Like, it doesn't.
[65:39.67]I knew it.
[65:40.11]I've given up fucking 16 runs.
[65:41.91]Like, I know.
[65:42.61]Like, I don't... I don't like... It's not gonna do anything to me.
[65:46.01]I already know.
[65:53.44]You got further than I. It's alright.
[65:54.78]It's alright.
[65:55.16]I'm good.
[65:55.59]It's the next banner.
[66:04.98]He's on the verge of tears.
[66:09.46]God damn it.
[66:10.14]I'm so upset.
[66:22.42]Medic's right here.
[66:23.12]It's okay.
[66:24.32]Medic is right here.
[66:25.06]We're going to give him the gun.
[66:27.48]What the fuck is that noise?
[66:28.76]Where are you?
[66:29.38]And stop doing this.
[66:31.37]I'm not giving up any more home runs.
[66:33.23]Where are you going?
[66:44.96]Oh, he does.
[66:45.36]He just runs, right?
[66:47.56]Why does he not get hurt by the steam?
[66:53.59]I know what to do.
[66:55.21]It's not going to be a problem.
[67:01.62]I know what to do.
[67:07.26]No more home runs.
[67:16.43]What?
[67:16.83]What happened?
[67:19.13]He's infected?
[67:20.73]Not yet.
[67:21.17]Not yet.
[67:21.55]I still need the heals.
[67:25.92]Don't go.
[67:28.66]Alright, now wait a minute.
[67:29.82]I can do it from anywhere, can't I?
[67:33.44]Let me just test this hypothesis.
[67:35.30]Can I just shoot this from here?
[67:43.70]Okay.
[67:44.48]Alright.
[67:48.02]Got it.
[67:48.96]Got that one.
[67:50.26]Turn around.
[67:50.68]Let's get this one too.
[67:54.61]You're fine.
[67:56.25]This is one I have to wrap around.
[68:07.42]Okay, we're good.
[68:08.04]A little bit more.
[68:10.86]This one's destroyed.
[68:12.28]This one also has the obnoxious spawn.
[68:14.82]Should I kill him now?
[68:15.76]I think I'm going to kill him.
[68:17.70]Yeah, I'm going to headshot him like three times.
[68:20.92]Give me my gun back.
[68:26.65]I'm not dealing with that scripted bullshit.
[68:37.28]I'm sorry, guys.
[68:43.90]I just fucking panicked.
[68:47.79]I should have used him down here.
[68:51.15]I should have used him down there.
[68:57.46]Damn it.
[69:01.26]I waited.
[69:02.14]I waited.
[69:04.44]Oh, the tears.
[69:06.00]I'm going to start crying.
[69:07.80]I waited.
[69:08.54]Twice.
[69:11.60]Somebody get in there and fucking patch that.
[69:52.66]moment of truth incoming in about one to two minutes I'm patching it right now are you seriously thanks man appreciate that
[70:07.38]Are you serious?
[70:07.80]Is this a bait?
[70:18.39]Ya boy!
[70:18.87]10 more subs, ya boy!
[70:19.89]That's like 50.
[70:20.21]Holy shit, ya boy.
[70:22.73]Thank you.
[70:23.09]I already got this one.
[70:32.19]Well, that's great.
[70:33.45]What a waste of ammo.
[70:36.10]Okay, at least I have enough of this.
[70:39.80]No, but seriously, boy, that's a lot of subs.
[70:49.31]Okay, this is it.
[70:56.84]Alright, okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[71:19.64]What happened?
[71:20.66]What?
[71:21.36]Why'd they dis- they disappeared?
[71:22.48]Why?
[71:43.03]No, no, no.
[71:43.93]I'm out of bullets.
[71:45.71]I'm out of bullets for this gun.
[71:50.68]Oh my god, it's the stupidest fucking thing.
[72:03.93]Where is the big guy?
[72:05.23]Is he dead?
[72:07.55]Where's the big guy?
[72:08.67]Did he jump off the cliff?
[72:20.08]Is he in the wall?
[72:24.34]Oh my god, I forgot!
[72:29.36]Shoot the shotgun!
[72:31.60]Shoot!
[72:33.77]I just was holding it down!
[72:41.99]You gotta be kidding me.
[73:13.05]I was holding the button down and he was just going like this.
[73:22.80]I don't have any bullets.
[73:23.98]I need to use the rifle, I think.
[73:25.81]How the fuck am I going to do this?
[73:34.05]Return this game to Blockbuster.
[73:37.79]You don't hold the trigger with the shotgun.
[73:39.67]But if you shoot... I can't even explain this.
[73:42.57]If I click the button, the shotgun sucks.
[73:49.07]it's it's bad the game's mechanic with shotgun is a fucking full a full like two weeks full diaper worth of shit full this is going to be a living hell I don't have any what am I going to do
[74:25.91]I don't know if this is even hitting.
[74:39.47]Is this hitting?
[74:43.71]And that's not how a rifle works either.
[74:47.55]OK.
[75:10.36]If there isn't a save point in here.
[75:17.58]What's that I hear?
[75:19.14]I hear something.
[75:26.31]Fuck you!
[75:26.87]Fuck you!
[75:27.37]Fuck you!
[75:28.35]Just go and go, go, go, go, go and go and save the game right now.
[75:30.81]I don't even care.
[75:31.77]No, this is my softlock, but we're going to do it right here.
[75:44.99]It's only giving me shotgun bullets, man.
[75:47.37]I could have turned... Really.
[75:51.15]I could have turned these off.
[75:53.43]I could have turned them off.
[75:59.28]What was on the ground?
[76:00.00]Okay.
[76:06.66]Well, I have plenty of shotgun ammo.
[76:08.65]That's great, because it's my least favorite fucking gun in the game.
[76:11.69]I actually got a save point.
[76:28.04]I turned it off.
[76:29.41]What?
[76:47.09]Is there another one that I turned off instead of this one?
[76:53.96]There are two of them.
[76:56.04]You turned off the soda machine.
[77:16.83]I don't have any bullets to shoot that with, besides the pistol.
[77:20.15]But I'm not gonna kill this thing with a pistol.
[77:26.24]So there's this one and then the other one.
[77:27.75]So go through.
[77:30.71]Turn it off and... What on the name of God?
[77:38.22]You...
[77:55.65]Are you alive?
[77:56.47]You put point blank with a shotgun and you're still alive?
[78:02.33]More rifle ammo.
[78:03.91]Somebody just gave, uh, JermaSucks just gave five community subs.
[78:06.91]Thank you, JermaSucks.
[78:08.05]I appreciate it.
[78:11.53]Thank you.
[78:11.87]Alright, rifle ammo.
[78:14.67]I want more SMG ammo.
[78:16.18]This is not going to go very well at all.
[78:19.24]I know what's going to happen.
[78:20.06]Open it.
[78:25.84]Okay, so... Why is that happening with a pistol?
[78:52.69]I'm wasting ammo.
[78:53.57]It doesn't matter.
[78:57.15]That's the same shit that's happening with the shotgun!
[79:02.87]Clean... It's clean your mouse.
[79:05.21]My mouse is so dirty that that's what's happening.
[79:08.69]The computer can't handle the advanced game.
[79:12.25]All I need is one shot.
[79:16.51]You know what?
[79:16.81]That's true.
[79:17.17]Let's go.
[79:22.01]What?
[79:23.41]Hold on.
[79:25.89]Six.
[79:28.39]Where is this thing?
[79:29.31]I'm going in?
[79:29.68]Come on!
[79:39.60]Turn the fucking thing off!
[79:40.90]What the fuck?!
[79:43.96]I pressed it!
[79:45.18]Where?!
[79:46.44]Oh my goodness!
[79:47.88]I cannot believe this game!
[80:02.64]Now I gotta go around those boxes.
[80:04.88]In fact, we're gonna make this easy.
[80:07.47]So I have... This one's off, right?
[80:09.23]I hope so.
[80:10.03]I don't... What?
[80:19.06]I turned this one back on?
[80:25.16]Did somebody make this area in Mario Maker?
[80:29.57]Is this...
[80:36.52]So it turns that one... So I have to destroy it.
[80:39.04]Fuck.
[80:48.20]Okay.
[80:48.84]So, again, we have this one here.
[80:51.21]I have to sneak across.
[80:55.01]Open door.
[80:55.73]Go!
[80:58.47]Oh, turn off.
[80:59.17]Duck.
[81:01.89]Sneak through here.
[81:04.11]Wait, did I get all this stuff...
[81:06.61]Just let me even just get a fucking item on the corner.
[81:11.81]And then watch out for the monster.
[81:16.19]What?
[81:16.89]Hold on.
[81:20.57]I was waiting so long for you to show up that I hurt myself there.
[81:26.26]Okay, here we go.
[81:27.24]Now I'm gonna heal.
[81:29.44]I want full health for this.
[81:31.68]Let's take a look.
[81:32.66]I now have two...
[81:37.50]From here, just... I'm going to destroy this one right now.
[81:47.96]There's two of them, I think.
[81:54.06]I hope this is hitting.
[81:59.80]Is that one too?
[82:00.38]Is it not?
[82:07.87]It is.
[82:18.55]Okay.
[82:20.25]Now we turn off this one.
[82:25.44]Give me ammo.
[82:29.26]And I think I... I was trying to pick up something over here.
[82:36.30]Okay.
[82:41.11]Back in business.
[82:42.69]There should not be another one in this room.
[82:47.65]What?
[82:47.89]What's that?
[82:49.77]Wait.
[82:50.19]Why they... What's that one?
[82:57.44]I'm not taking chances here.
[82:59.42]I have no idea.
[82:59.86]They were both off.
[83:00.38]I don't care.
[83:12.26]Okay.
[83:18.06]Cutscene.
[83:18.76]Thank God I can restart at this level.
[83:22.40]Please, can I... Please let me be done with, like, this stupid shit.
[83:29.58]Where's Cohen?
[83:30.57]I thought he was with you.
[83:32.09]No, he went to the medical supply area to pick up more antibiotics.
[83:35.93]And you let him go alone?
[83:37.31]What the hell are you thinking?
[83:38.93]Oh, relax.
[83:39.63]The area's secure.
[83:41.74]It gets stupider.
[83:42.58]Are you crazy?
[83:43.34]Those things are everywhere.
[83:44.88]Then why don't you go find him?
[83:46.92]No, I think I'm going to stay right here.
[83:49.36]Why would you let him do that?
[83:50.72]Shoot him.
[83:51.78]Why would you let him pull the gun up?
[83:55.04]You should have just shot him right when he started the movie.
[83:57.78]I don't know what kind of game you're playing here, but it ends now.
[84:02.24]Yeah, and it ends with you.
[84:04.75]If either one of them shoots right now, they win.
[84:07.65]What's wrong with you?
[84:11.04]Hey, guys!
[84:11.66]Wait!
[84:12.90]Follow me!
[84:15.42]Uh... Pick one?
[84:31.68]What if I give them something?
[84:32.82]Here.
[84:33.46]Take a... handgun.
[84:36.86]Can I have your- Wait, can I take his handgun?
[84:40.92]Test.
[84:41.30]I don't have any tests.
[84:53.74]Kill one.
[85:01.80]Stick him with the adrenaline.
[85:03.43]That might calm them down.
[85:04.53]Oh, yeah.
[85:08.21]Have a little bit of adrenaline.
[85:16.99]Oh, shit!
[85:25.38]Who's... What's up?
[85:30.94]Okay, well, that we settled that.
[85:33.18]Um... You just see what... You did not just see what happened there?
[85:37.90]Here, take some bullets.
[85:42.60]Really?
[85:45.09]I'm one magazine away from you being my friend.
[85:48.39]Are you friends?
[86:06.22]No, I just gave you adrenaline.
[86:12.99]Necromancy, thanks for the five subs.
[86:14.69]Heal him.
[86:15.09]I don't have any heals.
[86:17.11]I don't have anything.
[86:19.37]I'm gonna let you be... Seriously, Necromancy.
[86:22.45]Thanks for the five subs.
[86:34.30]Maybe you will get us out of this.
[86:37.40]Alright, me and your buddies.

[87:08.34]I just gave you a much better gun.
[87:10.44]Why would you be that?
[87:11.34]Even now you don't like me.
[87:12.56]I gave you something way better than what you had.
[87:14.42]Okay, I have a health pack.
[87:17.32]Uh... Let me go on... Where did I go?
[87:20.16]Go on the computer?
[87:22.60]Current tests on the smaller alien fragments have proved successful.
[87:25.52]Full-scale testing will commence when a subsuitable test subject has been obtained.
[87:30.53]Alright.
[87:31.85]You and me.
[87:32.15]Let's go.
[87:35.37]I need ammo.
[87:37.83]Oh, we can go this way.
[87:40.04]Or we can go... I hear a beep.
[87:43.64]Is this guy an engineer?
[87:44.32]Okay, well, it looks like we're going over here.
[87:50.32]What are we doing?
[87:51.02]That neck?
[87:51.54]I can't... I need to look at it in my phone.
[87:57.93]That's terrifying.
[87:59.13]My neck is terrifying?
[88:01.87]What does it look like?
[88:03.89]Did I miss a raid?! !
[88:07.05]Joel came in with a raid?
[88:08.65]Oh, shit.
[88:10.57]Well, what's going on?
[88:11.23]Welcome.
[88:11.53]Hey, what's up, Joel?
[88:13.93]Hey, how are you?
[88:18.01]How long ago did that happen?
[88:20.07]Was I too busy being angry?
[88:22.33]Somebody said crackhead.
[88:23.25]Hold on.
[88:24.57]I hope you had a good stream.
[88:25.27]I don't know what you were doing, but hopefully you had fun.
[88:28.69]And those of you that just joined us, we are at the end game of The Thing for PC.
[88:35.14]And it is quite a video game.
[88:37.96]I've been a little bit upset by this game.
[88:40.48]But it's okay.
[88:42.09]We're almost done with it.
[88:43.17]I just have to get to the end.
[88:45.69]Alright, what do we got?
[88:46.75]Let me see this image.
[88:49.81]But, welcome.
[88:50.51]Thanks a lot, Joel.
[88:51.33]Appreciate it.
[88:53.51]We have to play something fucking sometime.
[88:54.95]Seriously.
[88:56.69]Now, I know this is... I know that's doctored.
[88:59.71]You're not gonna get me again with this shit.
[89:01.19]I know that this is a fake... I know that's a doctored image.
[89:04.07]Not this time.
[89:06.27]It's not going to happen this time.
[89:08.29]Because I know that somebody fucked with the eyes.
[89:14.13]That's fine.
[89:15.41]Here, look.
[89:18.61]Take a look at the eyes.
[89:19.99]Somebody... I... That's okay.
[89:24.42]I know that it's fucking not real.
[89:27.00]So... We can move on.
[89:29.78]It's not real.
[89:30.70]It's fine.
[89:40.77]It's not a real picture.
[89:44.77]Okay, let's play.
[89:49.11]Ooh, Engineer?
[89:51.57]I hear the electricity.
[89:53.59]Where is it?
[89:53.97]What the fuck is going on in here?
[90:06.32]Oh, yes.
[90:10.23]Quick, somebody load a softball and put a dunk tank up.
[90:14.92]Maybe you'll dunk him.
[90:20.98]Alright, do we have an engineer?
[90:22.36]Please?
[90:22.80]Yes, get it.
[90:28.77]I hope you're not infected.
[90:29.67]I hate playing this game alone.
[90:30.77]It sucks.
[90:37.48]Alright.
[90:39.23]Uh, how much is that?
[90:42.13]What are you doing?
[90:43.01]How much?
[90:44.45]That's five, 50,000.
[90:47.97]What are you doing?
[90:49.13]What happened?
[90:51.49]50,000 bits.
[90:54.22]Holy shit.
[90:54.84]You just gave that's $500 right now.
[91:02.60]Why does the thing do this?
[91:07.22]That's a shitload of fucking money.
[91:11.33]The thing has like... There's something about it.
[91:16.91]I missed a ton of bits too earlier.
[91:18.63]Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
[91:22.25]That's a fucking lot.
[91:23.43]What did they say?
[91:23.99]Did they say anything?
[91:29.46]I can't alt tab and it's not... Hold on, can I do this?
[91:34.95]Come on.
[91:36.15]I need to... There's a save game right here, right?
[91:38.95]Yes, there is.
[91:39.37]Alright, I can... I can save it and then I'll tap.
[91:41.95]Because I want to see... Because that's a lot of fucking money.
[91:44.21]Alright, that's saved.
[91:46.65]Let's see if I can... Because I have to, like, switch to here.
[91:56.38]Jesus Christ.
[91:58.86]They say, Terminator, Terminator, Terminator.
[92:01.68]Hey, Jerma, just finished up a really tough day at work.
[92:04.10]It would make me feel a lot better if you could do, if you could awoo for me.
[92:09.01]Vilemi, thanks for the, the ridiculous, the insane amount of bits.
[92:15.97]Too many.
[92:18.11]You want me to awoo for you?
[92:20.52]Ugh.
[92:26.43]Do I have to do it on camera?
[92:27.89]I don't have to do it on camera.
[92:32.97]Because on camera is like, that's, it's $500, I have to do it on camera.
[92:47.46]I was actually just thinking about right now of disabling clips of my channel.
[92:52.30]For, like, the next 30 seconds.
[92:54.37]But that's too much to... I think, actually, can I do that?
[93:03.57]Don't.
[93:07.30]But I feel like if I do that, I might delete every clip that's ever been taken on the channel.
[93:10.48]So that's, like, kind of a bad thing to do.
[93:18.43]Thanks for the 500 bucks.
[93:20.79]That's too much money.
[93:23.07]I can't even comprehend it.
[93:29.41]I can't.
[93:36.13]I can't do it.
[93:37.03]I can't do it.
[93:37.87]It's too much.
[93:39.22]And I'm not stalling.
[93:40.08]I'm just, I can't do it.
[93:43.06]I can't fucking do it.
[94:00.85]Done.
[94:02.43]Thanks for the fucking huge amount of money.
[94:12.85]Here, take some more ammo.
[94:19.12]Now we're best friends.
[94:20.72]Both earphones have to go in.
[94:22.47]Was it worth it?
[94:23.77]I don't know.
[94:24.37]I just, I can't believe someone just did 50,000 bits and there was more earlier too.
[94:28.37]That's, that's a lot of money.
[94:38.88]I'll be, I'll be, I'll be getting like a steak at some point.
[94:45.10]Maybe.
[94:45.28]Maybe.
[94:47.85]I might get... Is that some kind of, like, dig that you're not that good of an engineer or something?
[94:58.35]Because you're right here.
[95:08.86]How are you not an engineer?
[95:10.26]You just... God damn it, I need an engineer.
[95:14.42]I just got one.
[95:15.42]There's one right here.
[95:19.10]Oh.
[95:20.76]There we go.
[95:22.12]Okay.
[95:23.30]Do it!
[95:25.33]Gonna go to Texas Roadhouse.
[95:29.65]No, I'm... I'm gonna go to Chili's.
[95:33.79]And I'm gonna get the steak at Chili's.
[95:41.59]Ooh, wait.
[95:43.30]That panel controls the timed security door to the black tech lab.
[95:46.96]I can jam the door from the inside, but you'll have to stay here and flick the switch.
[95:50.98]That only stays open for a few seconds, so give me some time to get there first.
[95:54.77]What?
[95:55.81]That was a lot.
[95:57.57]Open security door.
[95:58.53]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[95:59.83]He's just gone.
[96:00.27]He's gone.
[96:00.79]You gotta repeat instructions.
[96:05.57]Is he there?
[96:07.38]Why is he coming back?
[96:08.14]What?
[96:08.28]What?
[96:20.49]Where is this guy?
[96:21.45]Is he dead?
[97:12.89]Clear the room and then open the door.
[97:25.18]I think he's dead.
[97:29.30]I think I might have soft-locked it.
[97:30.40]Somebody, another 5000 bits!
[97:33.65]then tibetan hovercraft thanks for the five subs numble numb legs thanks for the five thousand bits Jerma please for the love of god read the big bits like these ones fifty dollars can I even do this did he go through a door
[98:02.60]He's good, he's good.
[98:06.39]But that's a thank you for the fucking $50.
[98:09.71]Let me see if I can look at it.
[98:13.75]Yeah, he's infected, for sure.
[98:20.91]Without a single doubt in my mind.
[98:26.63]Yeah, I knew.
[98:27.35]Of course, he's locking me in here.
[98:30.65]What?
[98:31.36]What do you mean, 30 seconds?
[98:47.69]Breathe deep, Blake.
[99:00.34]What do I do?
[99:09.58]Leave.
[99:10.52]Shoot window.
[99:11.12]Did I just shoot it?
[99:13.18]Shoot vent on roof.
[99:18.84]What do I do?
[99:19.12]I have 1.3 seconds.
[99:54.16]Hold on a second, let me see the ones that I missed.
[99:56.19]They just lock me in there and like poison me and I die?
[100:00.45]Come on.
[100:08.32]Let me see... I see numlegs gave 10,000 bits.
[100:16.48]They said, will this get your attention?
[100:19.50]for a hundred dollars, and it didn't.
[100:21.94]So, sorry about that.
[100:23.44]That's, um, it did not.
[100:27.09]But it's got it now, because that's a ton of fucking money.
[100:30.51]Thank you, numblegs, for the hundred and fifty dollars right there.
[100:36.36]Will this get your attention?
[100:38.30]Unfortunately, it did not.
[100:45.33]And then Fitty gave 5,000 bits.
[100:47.09]I think we missed that too.
[100:48.35]He said, did somebody say money stream?
[100:51.29]It's the thing.
[100:57.45]I should just re-broadcast the thing.
[101:01.32]Just every day that I'm not live.
[101:04.14]Just start it from the beginning.
[101:13.24]You know how people do reruns?
[101:16.41]But sorry I missed that.
[101:17.56]That's a huge amount of money to miss.
[101:21.58]Only $100.
[101:21.86]Whoops.
[101:23.70]Where was it?
[101:24.26]I didn't see.
[101:26.16]Sorry.
[101:26.40]That's a lot of money.
[101:29.02]Thank you for the money stream.
[101:31.96]Holy shit.
[101:34.02]If you do that, it would include O-W-O.
[101:36.66]Not O-W-O.
[101:37.86]Awoo.
[101:38.45]Not A-W-O.
[101:39.51]It's A-W-O.
[101:40.59]Not O-W-O.
[101:42.73]A-W-O is what it would be.
[101:45.03]Get it right.
[101:50.83]Alright, here we go.
[101:52.77]Same deal.
[101:54.17]Hey, can you do this?
[101:55.94]Yeah.
[101:56.82]Kill everything for me, please, won't you?
[101:58.92]I need an engineer.
[102:01.20]He's got O-W-O on the mind.
[102:03.68]Yeah, because it's every, like, 110th comment in the stream.
[102:10.13]What do you mean I have it on the mind?
[102:15.93]More like 30.
[102:16.87]Probably.
[102:18.35]Something like that.
[102:20.27]That panel controls the timed security door to the black tech lab.
[102:23.93]I can jam the door from the inside, but you'll have to stay here and flick the switch.
[102:27.97]That only stays open for a few seconds, so give me some time to get there first.
[102:31.92]You got it.
[102:32.32]Should I just kill him now?
[102:35.22]Area looks secure.
[102:44.95]We got company.
[102:51.51]He just ran through it.
[103:05.92]Die.

[104:19.48]Look, I can only help you if you get your shit together.
[104:23.14]This is another guy?
[104:24.26]Different guy!

[104:59.79]Oh.
[105:00.85]Fuck.
[105:35.93]I tried.
[105:40.01]It's all good.
[105:44.26]We don't even need to go in the other room.
[105:45.46]Who cares?
[105:45.96]The guy's dead.
[105:46.52]I don't even need to go in there.
[105:53.49]Okay.
[105:56.17]Go!
[106:08.22]Power on.
[106:08.92]Okay.
[106:09.22]Now turn off.
[106:10.75]Turn it off.
[106:16.17]Turn it off.
[106:17.91]Turn it off.
[106:19.15]Turn it off.
[106:20.75]Turn it off.
[106:21.85]Turn it off.
[106:22.35]Just turn it off.
[106:23.67]Turn it off.
[106:29.48]Okay.
[106:38.30]Nice.
[106:42.23]Alright, so now... Okay, there's a save point there.
[106:50.29]Just checking to see.
[106:51.55]I don't want to miss anything.
[106:52.55]Got all the health packs.
[106:54.43]Do I have... I have six HP packs.
[106:59.21]Save point in here.
[107:04.77]Good.
[107:07.68]Good.
[107:10.00]Does this do anything?
[107:10.82]Does this do anything?
[107:11.96]Does this do anything?
[107:12.98]Does that do anything?
[107:15.08]Does that do anything?
[107:16.82]Nothing in here does anything.
[107:18.88]Does... Does there any... Alright, I've come... Alright, here we go.
[107:21.77]Guy in here.
[107:23.63]He's... Uh, he's not even in here.
[107:31.75]Alright, not even in... Got it.
[107:38.76]So back here, then?
[108:03.40]That didn't really do anything.
[108:06.74]Any computers to look at?
[108:11.32]Testing's going well and there is a very positive feel within the team today.
[108:14.13]Stoll's work is impeccable as usual and Ryan is picking up the new technology at a reasonable pace.
[108:22.01]Cool.
[108:24.94]The anti-thing virus is proving to be our finest work to date.
[108:29.01]None of this could have been possible without the fine people I work with on this groundbreaking project.
[108:33.87]Alright.
[108:42.12]That was, that sucked.
[108:43.58]That hurt my brain.
[108:56.08]Burn!
[108:56.56]And then save!
[108:58.91]Get outta here.
[109:00.21]That was pretty clean.
[109:27.27]That was clean.
[109:30.37]Super grenades.
[109:33.09]On the way out that way.
[109:35.79]What did you miss?
[109:36.89]Dude, you have no idea.
[109:39.11]It was fucking insane.
[109:40.81]Found a large hole in the ventilation shaft this morning.
[109:43.99]I think some animal must have went in there.
[109:48.13]Must have been either retreated and died or whatever.
[109:51.12]I don't know.
[109:51.62]I've informed security and they are investigating.
[109:57.97]The beast has friends, the security team is dead, and I can't find anything to defend myself with.
[110:02.13]And everyone is reading this.
[110:09.35]Somebody grabbed him when he was typing.
[110:12.27]Somebody just like, he got his laugh.
[110:15.81]Okay, I gotta save.
[110:18.92]He was literally shaking.
[110:25.42]Alright.
[110:28.71]What's going on next?
[110:34.26]Oh, this is not the way to go?
[110:35.56]I thought this was going to be like an... I don't know.
[110:39.90]What?
[110:41.12]Oh, that sucks.
[110:46.10]So where do I actually go?
[110:59.64]I mean, in here, but what about this way?
[111:03.58]No.
[111:04.58]No.
[111:05.50]This probably opens.
[111:06.44]Open door to testing range.
[111:10.08]How the hell do I do that?
[111:16.60]Open the door to the testing range.
[111:22.57]Uh.
[111:25.99]Did I miss something in this room back here?
[111:29.52]Like, is this a computer or something?
[111:33.06]No?
[111:40.99]I don't think there's anything I missed.
[111:46.51]And this is one of the consoles up here.
[111:50.63]Can I touch anything with this?
[111:53.84]No.
[111:57.24]Uh...
[111:59.78]I didn't even... I didn't do that.
[112:00.82]They did.
[112:04.94]They opened that door.
[112:08.54]Okay.
[112:12.02]Alright.
[112:12.71]Here we go.
[112:15.55]Save.
[112:16.41]And it's time to fight.
[112:39.13]No, you're not gonna Mario Maker me right now.
[112:40.93]Sorry.
[112:56.42]Not right now.
[112:57.78]Not gonna happen.
[113:02.56]Why am I panicking?
[113:10.48]Oh shit!
[113:19.55]I gotta, alright, I gotta torch it.
[113:20.97]I gotta get in there and torch it.
[113:26.05]Oh, you motherfuckers.
[113:32.22]Burn!
[113:35.70]Oh!
[113:39.85]Alright.
[113:40.55]There's a button to press here.
[113:42.13]Why is there a button here?
[113:49.02]There he is.
[113:49.40]Gain access to weapons.
[113:55.22]What does that mean?
[114:05.83]I got fee flinched.
[114:18.75]Jerma's a broken man?
[114:20.01]Nah, not really.
[114:23.97]Maybe like 5% broken.
[114:26.95]Like, maybe 2%.
[114:27.80]Oh god, more... What the hell?
[114:38.12]Okay, this barrel's blocking this one.
[114:48.88]Why do I hear something?
[114:51.74]Code?
[114:52.80]Anything of interest?
[115:00.30]Not really.
[115:00.76]Ooh.
[115:04.26]He's in there.
[115:04.78]There he is.
[115:07.92]Just looking at the wall.
[115:17.23]Two guys here.
[115:17.99]I already know where this is.
[115:19.79]Alright, can this open?
[115:27.17]No.
[115:28.32]I gotta go this way.
[115:29.06]He's gonna see us.
[115:30.94]What do you mean, us?
[115:33.46]He's gonna see us.
[115:37.12]Well, here comes... What the fuck just happened?
[115:59.45]I just got electrocuted I couldn't pause the game because it's gonna happen like three more times Okay, we're good I hear a big guy This doesn't open
[116:20.92]Tons of ammo and weapons and armor and gear.
[116:24.35]Tons of gear.
[116:30.74]Nice.
[116:31.25]Look at all that gear.
[116:53.02]What else is on here?
[117:00.35]Why are these... Like an Easter egg or something?
[117:13.00]I think I scared everybody up there.
[117:39.93]Absolutely infected.
[117:43.93]But, you'll do.
[117:49.98]You'll do.
[117:51.18]I need you to open a door over here.
[117:52.26]I've got an itchy, itchy, itchy face and eyes today.
[117:55.06]What's going on with me?
[117:58.78]You'll do.
[118:02.78]Looks just like your last girlfriend.
[118:11.39]Okay.
[118:12.61]Uh... What the fuck are you talking about?
[118:17.69]Alright, come back here.
[118:22.95]I need you to do this.
[118:25.11]Do your thing.
[118:28.98]He's deranged.
[118:30.36]I know.
[118:30.98]But I think everybody here is deranged.
[118:34.32]I just need you to open a door and then maybe shoot at a couple of zombies.
[118:38.20]And we can be best friends.
[118:42.88]Good.
[118:46.28]And there's a save point in here too, so that's great.
[118:49.02]That means I can give you more than that.
[118:53.10]Take more ammo.
[118:57.41]You should be good.
[119:00.25]What is this?
[119:00.65]Is it like a grenade launcher or something?
[119:03.97]It's a microscope.
[119:04.66]I thought this was a scope.
[119:05.86]I thought it was like an attachment.
[119:07.50]I didn't think it was a microscope.
[119:08.56]Whatever.
[119:11.91]Okay.
[119:14.21]And... How do we get these doors open?
[119:17.64]That's fun.
[119:18.48]What a fun journey this is gonna be.
[119:20.36]I don't know.
[119:22.62]This door doesn't open.
[119:24.72]This door doesn't open.
[119:28.84]Uh, there is this.
[119:34.29]My stream froze?
[119:36.71]Hit the refresh button!
[119:44.05]Okay.
[119:50.05]That powers this room for me to be able to... Okay, there's that... Okay, that thing is in here.
[120:00.78]Not that concerning to me.
[120:03.66]But... This, on the other hand... Oh, shit.
[120:08.36]Would you look at that?
[120:17.04]Just kill it all first.
[120:18.20]Anything else?
[120:24.00]That's a giant cannon.
[120:25.10]It's got to go.
[120:29.70]I needed to... You need to check.
[120:39.30]Okay.
[120:45.95]Good.
[120:50.33]Check for mimics?
[120:53.55]Alright, hold on.
[120:54.75]Save the game.
[120:56.01]The weapons door is now open.
[120:59.89]It's down here, right?
[121:00.77]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[121:01.67]Don't just go in there.
[121:04.83]Where's the save point?
[121:05.49]Over here?
[121:07.99]Yep.
[121:09.25]Okay, save point is over here.
[121:11.23]Yep.
[121:11.71]Okay.
[121:13.95]I can't wait for you to turn now, because all your usefulness is gone.
[121:22.98]Keycard?
[121:24.25]What is that, a key to one of the doors?
[121:25.85]It is a giant cannon, I was right.
[121:30.61]I was actually correct.
[121:46.02]So now I have the key to open this door?
[121:56.12]You imbecile.
[121:57.02]But you know what?
[121:57.60]I like it that you're stupid because it makes it so I can beat this game easier.
[122:04.89]Oh.
[122:05.97]Hi.
[122:06.25]Um, okay.
[122:12.71]So, what's in here?
[122:16.33]There are grenades in here.
[122:17.43]Am I gonna hit myself with these grenades?
[122:23.88]Fire grenade?
[122:35.38]This is really fucking messy.
[122:36.74]Alright, I... I guess I'm just gonna shoot him around in a circle and fire.
[122:58.09]I think.
[123:01.59]Let me use a stun grenade.
[123:06.81]Oh, I forgot you guys are here.
[123:11.02]Fuck, shoot him.
[123:16.02]Alright, so how the fuck does this work?
[123:21.46]So, I'm gonna stun him, and then I have to kill the thing.
[123:23.94]Can you please come in here with me?
[123:28.09]Get in here.
[123:31.37]Why am I on that?
[123:42.16]What?
[123:42.48]He's fucking... How is he hitting me?
[123:55.87]This is fucked.
[124:04.39]There's a key?
[124:13.46]What?
[124:13.74]Hold on, there's a key in here.
[124:23.30]We get to fight another boss?
[124:24.92]That makes no fucking sense.
[124:29.02]Oh, I thought that was a bad guy.
[124:29.92]It's okay.
[124:33.16]Kill the soldiers and save?
[124:34.34]That's a good idea.
[124:51.43]Okay.
[124:55.21]So, uh... You can't really go anywhere.
[124:59.48]I'm gonna try to not... I mean, if I throw a grenade, the thing's gonna open.
[125:15.33]What the fuck?
[125:16.75]You don't even have.
[125:17.61]What the f?
[125:18.11]If the ground on fire?
[125:42.12]I'm dead.
[125:48.91]What?
[126:17.29]Spam stun grenades, but I... But I have to heal, too.
[126:24.05]And I can't put this on... I have to... So I'm just going to run to the back of the room, but every time I switch... Okay, let's try this.
[126:36.41]What are you doing?
[126:45.38]That stun- I- I have a gr- This is fucking ridiculous.
[126:59.87]And I love how it automatically puts me- It automatically puts me on the fucking stun gun.
[127:06.12]On the st- What's the speedrunner do?
[127:10.90]Because this is fucking ridiculous.
[127:18.01]I just, like, rage opened my phone, and this is the first thing that I see.
[127:21.73]I, no, I don't, I can't even do it.
[127:39.38]Is there a, like, stand underneath him, someone said?
[127:43.29]Stand next to it.
[127:46.77]Just give me the broken thing to do.
[128:02.65]Third boss fight, which is a giant tentacle thing.
[128:04.83]There's seemingly no safe place for you to hide without getting hit by the boss.
[128:08.37]Fortunately, you keep moving around on dodge today.
[128:09.71]There's actually a very easy way to prevent this, however.
[128:11.39]Stand literally... So you... No.
[128:15.33]So you have to stand literally right underneath him.
[128:17.67]Is the only way.
[128:33.81]I just want everyone to be aware of this.
[128:37.32]This is what we like to call... I can't... What do you want me to say?
[129:03.49]It's a bad program.
[129:05.01]Good point.
[129:10.20]Don't swing at me.
[129:10.96]Watch this.
[129:19.56]Can't reach.
[129:44.95]So now light him on fire Whoa, what the fuck is he doing?
[129:59.23]What just happened?
[130:20.16]Why is he just watching?
[130:29.32]Should I light him on fire again?
[130:36.29]Um, I think I have to burn him.
[130:42.80]Jesus Christ!
[130:50.79]Stop!
[130:51.09]Stop!
[130:51.49]Stop!
[130:54.61]Just die, die, die, burn, burn, burn, die, die, burn, burn, die, die, die, burn, burn, die, burn, burn, die, burn, burn, burn.
[131:03.25]What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What?
[131:18.25]What the fuck?
[131:43.02]Furlity, thanks for the 10 community fucking subs.
[131:45.98]Thank you.
[131:52.24]Thank you, seriously.
[131:53.52]Okay.
[132:01.20]Stop.
[132:03.74]So... So I'm not going to move when it says escape.
[132:12.09]I don't even want him coming out of there.
[132:16.47]Use the shotgun only.
[132:17.65]No.
[132:35.37]How many clips should it be?
[132:40.61]I know.
[132:41.23]It's a slug.
[132:42.25]It's a slug.
[132:43.09]I know.
[133:07.47]one more don't break them
[133:38.45]Why won't you?
[133:40.35]This is ridiculous!
[133:42.13]And I have the same amount of fucking health!
[133:47.91]Help!
[133:48.21]Help me!
[133:48.77]Help me!
[133:49.31]Help me!
[133:49.87]Help me!
[133:50.17]He's on my team?
[133:55.04]I have to say, dude, the thing just spins around in a circle and you're gonna get killed every time.
[133:58.70]The thing, you light it on fire and it just goes in a blender in a circle.
[134:03.44]Is there a reason why they decided to make every boss fight in a tiny fucking room?
[134:08.16]Why are we in this small room together?
[134:11.94]Why do we have to be in this, in every boss fight has to be a fucking shoebox?
[134:19.86]It's maddening.
[134:21.13]It doesn't make any fucking sense.
[134:26.85]Why do we have to be in such a small area?
[134:32.35]Don't, don't light him on fire.
[134:33.87]Well, I have to, that's the only way I can progress.
[134:38.03]I can't progress any other way.
[134:41.93]Just use normal weapons.
[134:43.67]I... I did... I was almost at 12 slug magazines on this motherfucker.
[134:53.42]How many... How many slug magazines do you want me to do?
[134:58.18]Use all.
[135:04.17]Why is it... Why are you doing this?
[135:06.23]Why are you doing this?
[135:20.37]Is it health-based or time-based?
[135:22.45]Um, I guess I could just sit here.
[135:32.79]Kill the other dude first?
[135:35.63]I mean... I can't... I can't move though.
[135:46.29]I fucking can't move.
[135:48.04]If I move, I'm gonna get hit.
[135:55.38]I think it's stupid.
[136:08.15]Why do you pick the stun gun every single fucking time when I'm just trying to cycle?
[136:15.23]Why do you have to do that?
[136:25.85]That's a bad idea.
[136:26.93]That's a really bad idea because now I have two things spawned in here.
[136:30.45]Don't fucking you dare.
[136:31.67]Oh my god, please.
[136:41.77]I'm out of health packs now.
[136:47.11]This is on easy.
[137:03.61]Do not use fire?
[137:16.33]What if I run out of bullets?
[137:17.39]I have to finish it with fire, so... I'm so fucked.
[137:28.23]How do I do... Because when I light him on fire here, I am absolutely 100% guaranteed to take, like, half health.
[137:39.81]Just stun him.
[137:41.63]Will he get stunned if I throw this into the wall back here?
[137:44.37]Like... But this is gonna hit me.
[137:55.42]It's gonna hit me.
[138:15.01]Why did I move?
[138:15.51]Because I was gonna get hit by the grenade.
[138:20.45]Oh my god.
[138:22.03]This shit...
[138:24.89]Oh my goodness.
[138:26.69]It's fucking ridiculous.
[138:31.09]When you enter the room, run along the middle seam of the floor to the junction to the fourth or fifth row of tiles deep into the room.
[138:37.64]You'll be in an excellent spot from the boss because it can't hit you.
[138:40.12]Shot until you damage it to red.
[138:42.32]Shoot- Imagine just fighting a boss.
[138:49.80]Imagine just fighting a fucking boss.
[138:53.27]What was that again?
[138:54.11]Go to the fourth tile in the room and take two steps to the right?
[139:06.11]What was the... To the middle seam.
[139:09.34]Go through the middle seam of the room.
[139:12.54]And then... Then what the hell happened?
[139:23.22]Use Flame Grenade and run away.
[139:30.05]This boss can only be killed by fire, but can be damaged.
[139:32.99]Middle seam of the floor to the junction of the fourth or fifth row of tiles.
[139:38.39]You'll be in an excellent spot from the boss, because it can't hit you.
[139:41.50]So, the fourth or fifth row of tiles?
[139:44.68]Let's go.
[139:47.14]I'm going to go to the four... One, two, three, four...
[139:52.04]Fourth or fifth junction of tiles.
[139:53.48]This is... One, two, three, four, fifth junction of tiles.
[139:58.44]I mean, can I move on the junction of tiles?
[140:01.30]No.
[140:01.76]I have to stay in the seam.
[140:03.26]I guess.
[140:04.34]And now I'm gonna die.
[140:14.18]So, what's the next part?
[140:15.54]Let's just damage him a bunch.
[140:19.88]But this guy's gonna get out.
[140:24.61]Shoot him and then use a fire grenade and run away.
[140:29.88]But then I got to deal with this dickhead.
[140:32.94]Shoot it to red?
[140:33.74]Yeah, I could.
[140:34.52]Hold on.
[140:37.76]I'm going to show you something.
[140:41.35]No.
[140:43.03]Because I downloaded a patch to make it so I could use... Hold on.
[140:55.50]okay so I have a patch that lets me use the mouse it's not a it's not a mod it's an official patch so it's already red I just shoot like four times so it's ready it's ready now so it's like you shoot it five times and now I use fire kill the other guy
[141:26.05]Use flame grenade and run.
[141:28.43]Hold on.
[141:29.11]I gotta, like, cha- I can't, like, even move my hand.
[141:31.67]Do you understand?
[141:32.16]Like, this is- I can't even move the mouse now.
[141:35.70]It wants me to do page up and page down.
[141:43.77]Oh, god damn it.
[141:49.20]Okay.
[141:50.48]So now, how much health?
[141:51.66]I don't even know how much health I have.
[141:53.70]Fire grenade.
[141:55.02]And then, fucking run.
[141:57.80]Kill other guy first.
[142:00.34]Wait, kill other dude first, then use the grenade, because he'll get out of the- I- Kill- I can't- I have to move!
[142:07.85]Fire grenade!
[142:08.69]Let's go now!
[142:23.75]so so
[143:05.57]You just broke out without even... Oh!
[143:23.96]I'm on the junction.
[143:25.38]I'm on the correct junction of tiles.
[143:26.83]Oh!
[143:34.63]The AI doesn't know.
[143:35.43]Okay.
[143:35.81]Alright.
[143:37.17]Wait a minute.
[143:39.27]Burn.
[143:39.95]Burn.
[143:40.65]Burn.
[143:41.33]Burn.
[143:42.83]I'm just gonna burn.
[143:44.03]Fuck.
[143:45.19]Okay.
[143:45.57]Forget about throwing grenades.
[143:54.43]I need to go immediately to the machine gun.
[143:56.25]Die, please.
[144:02.98]Oh my god.
[144:06.92]It was supposed to be red.
[144:25.97]It was supposed to be red.
[144:28.27]Why was it not red?
[144:29.79]Watch it!
[144:39.38]that was supposed to be red I did it it was red and yeah I delight him on fire like five six times I have no health I am going to die I there are going to be people soldiers everywhere
[145:13.89]I just have to get in that door.
[145:33.72]Oh my goodness.
[145:41.56]Alright, let me go back in here.
[145:44.70]Is there anything else in this room?
[145:46.32]There's this shit.
[145:52.65]Grenades.
[145:55.35]Grenades.
[145:58.45]Super grenades.
[145:59.21]I have all those that I can fill.
[146:00.87]There's a key.
[146:03.11]Did I get the key already?
[146:04.83]Didn't they have a key?
[146:06.85]Did I already get it?
[146:11.22]Did I get the key?
[146:15.71]I don't think so.
[146:18.55]Maybe?
[146:18.85]I don't know.
[146:19.51]Alright, save it again.
[146:20.19]Okay.
[146:35.92]Save.
[146:46.19]uh alright so what what does that even do for me I I won I guess anything else to do in here
[147:11.47]Just escape?
[147:13.21]You mean like actually just run away?
[147:15.76]Okay.
[147:32.19]It looks like we're running away.
[147:33.55]We're escaping.
[147:43.12]Uh... Escaping to where?
[147:47.94]Just leave?
[147:48.68]Yeah, that's... Uh... So I came in this way.
[148:02.32]Didn't I?
[148:02.70]Oh, I lost my friend.
[148:09.01]That's great.
[148:10.03]Oh...
[148:26.81]Just haunted house explosions.
[148:30.39]Great.
[148:42.20]Don't make me go back up here.
[148:44.38]Don't make me go back up this shit with the steam.
[149:17.10]I'm not softlocked.
[149:18.47]I'm fine.
[149:45.93]It's infuriating.
[149:47.49]It's infuriating.
[149:51.53]Actually, he's off-locked.
[150:05.90]What?
[150:06.64]That doesn't even... I can't... What other complaints can I have?
[150:12.24]I gotta go near the door to activate the explosion to hit me and kill me.
[150:17.23]How far can I get before it-
[151:15.71]Health pack, anything, please?
[151:26.31]So, what if I just don't walk forward yet?
[151:29.11]I mean, I think I actually am softlocked.
[151:33.34]Because it goes boom, boom, boom.
[151:34.18]Does it just time?
[151:35.42]It might be timed.
[151:37.86]Because you just explode here.
[151:54.72]What the fuck is going on?
[152:09.71]I'm afraid to take a step forward because of the landmine fire.
[152:14.47]I don't know what to do.
[152:15.11]Should I take a step forward?
[152:16.29]Should I wait?
[152:16.83]Is it done?
[152:28.31]Can I go forward?
[152:33.52]Wait, hold on.
[152:34.34]Explosion.
[152:36.52]I wouldn't even near it.
[152:37.56]I wouldn't even near it.
[152:38.66]I wouldn't even near it.
[152:49.34]This is bad.
[152:50.04]This is bad.
[152:54.34]Alright, wait.
[153:07.65]Go.
[153:08.41]Wait!
[153:09.93]Go.
[153:10.83]Wait.
[153:12.87]Go.
[153:21.89]Just watch the ending on YouTube.
[153:23.95]We've come so far.
[153:25.16]And I died to steam.
[153:38.15]We're getting to Simpsons hit and run level.
[153:44.71]But you just get hurt.
[153:48.53]It doesn't matter.
[153:49.17]You have to take some damage.
[153:50.93]And...
[153:52.48]I guess I don't- I must need to have like a health pack by now, I think?
[154:01.85]The less of his face you can see on the camera, that's how you know how angry he is.
[154:06.52]Because I lean forward and I go, what the fuck was that?
[154:12.74]I'm not moving.
[154:26.20]I'm not moving.
[154:30.60]You were off camera the whole fear playthrough.
[154:32.62]Notice how long that steam was.
[154:37.49]Four.
[154:44.39]It's different every time.
[154:55.27]Don't move, don't move, not moving.
[155:06.46]Just wait.
[155:22.45]This is an escape, a run away segment.
[155:27.74]Shouldn't I be able to run away?
[155:29.94]Oh, it happens right here.
[155:50.21]Okay, somebody tell me how that's fucking fair at all.
[155:53.76]For the whole game, every second of this game, the game, the whole entire video game.
[155:59.55]Explain to me why what just happened was okay.
[156:39.04]Enemy?
[156:40.20]How did you get down here?
[156:41.52]How did you get down here?
[156:42.52]It's fucking impressive.
[156:52.92]Huh?
[156:53.38]I hear two big things.
[157:01.67]Where the fuck?
[157:02.49]Where are you?
[157:03.17]Where are you?
[157:04.35]Where is this person?
[157:05.51]Where are they?
[157:06.17]Oh, they're fighting the... You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[157:23.70]You gotta be fucking kidding me. You gotta be fucking kidding me. You gotta be fucking kidding me. You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[157:47.86]You gotta be...
[158:12.48]But the explosions.
[158:18.26]When did it happen?
[158:23.48]But the explosions.
[158:24.73]I don't know.
[158:25.67]I'm fucking terrified.
[158:27.77]Because that sucked.
[158:31.13]Please don't blow up on me.
[158:32.19]Please don't blow up on me.
[158:33.15]Please don't blow up on me.
[158:34.13]Please don't blow up on me.
[158:35.17]Please.
[158:38.53]I'm so close.
[158:39.64]Just don't die to the steam.
[158:41.90]And don't explode!
[158:49.78]Where's the explosion?
[158:50.68]Oh no.
[159:28.66]If something comes out of there, you guys realize if a fucking little alien jumps out of there.
[160:10.44]Use a heal?
[160:11.91]What heal?
[160:12.33]I don't have a heal.
[160:13.41]Where's the med kit?
[160:14.75]Where's the med kit?
[160:15.37]What are you talking about?
[160:16.31]What do you mean med kit?
[160:18.93]You heal.
[160:20.05]Heal you.
[160:20.97]Heal.
[160:22.10]Why would you do that to me right now?
[160:23.34]That's not funny.
[160:24.56]That's fucking horrible.
[160:26.14]Why would you do that to me right now?
[160:27.50]I'm so fucking dead.
[160:32.21]I hear a little guy and he's gonna peek around the corner and I'm dead.
[160:43.73]This is the wrong way.
[160:45.12]Wrong way.
[161:22.08]He can't get in.
[161:29.12]He can't get in.
[161:42.66]This game is unbelievable.
[161:45.16]Did they spit?
[161:45.76]Did they spit?
[161:46.35]Anybody know if they spit?
[161:47.45]They spawn little ones.
[161:49.23]Okay.
[161:52.71]Do they spit?
[161:53.21]I don't know if they spit or not.
[162:00.97]Don't light the vent on fire, Jeremy.
[162:02.85]Fuck.
[162:19.44]Fuck.
[162:25.05]One but there's... Where'd it go?
[162:53.18]Should I throw a grenade?
[162:53.94]He's still alive.
[163:05.10]Okay, he's still alive.
[163:15.29]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[163:20.49]Literally, my life depends on making these shots.
[163:27.29]I don't hear anything.
[163:31.59]Are you sure they spawn every time?
[163:45.80]Nothing spawned.
[163:52.85]Nothing spawned.
[163:56.73]Oh shit, oh shit.
[163:59.93]But there's probably something else down there, I need to heal.
[164:33.50]Okay.
[165:02.93]There's another one.
[165:04.41]Okay.
[165:18.84]Oh, God.
[165:19.18]Oh, God.
[165:19.48]Oh, God.
[165:20.14]Oh, God.
[165:20.56]That one just tried to bait me.
[165:21.32]Did you see that?
[165:21.88]Did you see that little thing?
[165:23.06]Okay.
[165:24.44]This is a problem.
[165:26.06]This is a problem.
[165:33.89]I just this is still a little one right there that's going to be the end of me it's going to be the problem there's a little one hanging out somewhere
[165:56.43]That's the fucking worst thing that's ever happened to me in a game.
[166:00.69]Without a doubt, that's the scariest.
[166:02.45]Because I know I have zero health.
[166:04.27]And that's like 30 minutes of... That was really, really, really real.
[166:09.16]That was real.
[166:10.44]That's what would happen if a monster tried to kill me in real life.
[166:14.88]Like, my heart right now is going... If a monster ran down a hallway and tried to kill me, that's the worst thing ever.
[166:23.95]Holy shit.
[166:26.27]I don't want to do this again.
[166:27.23]It's like a 30 fucking minute segment.
[166:29.95]And it sucks.
[166:31.61]There's no other little ones, right?
[166:32.83]They would have come... Is the game just spawning these things at this point?
[166:41.42]I'm gonna run out of fire.
[167:01.95]Don't back up?
[167:11.68]What do you mean stop backing up?
[167:31.10]If a small one comes in here, I need room to shoot it.
[167:33.70]Otherwise, I'm dead.
[167:42.91]Oh, shit!
[167:43.79]Little ones.
[167:44.37]Little ones.
[167:45.01]Little ones.
[167:48.23]How many little ones?
[167:48.87]Just one?
[167:50.43]Ah, there were two.
[168:11.09]He was blocking the bullets.
[168:12.89]He was blocking the bullets with his body.
[168:19.76]What the hell is going on here?
[168:27.28]Die back there, die back there, die back there, die back there, die back there!
[168:39.38]Go, go, go.
[168:40.06]No, not go.
[168:40.81]What do you mean go?
[168:42.99]What do you mean go?
[168:52.28]Little guy.
[168:57.01]Okay, get back in here.
[168:57.91]It's safe in here.
[169:13.51]I wish I had a flare.
[169:21.56]I saw a little one running by and that thing's not dead.
[169:36.70]Where is it?
[169:45.22]Oh, fuck.
[169:55.52]God, this sucks.
[169:59.79]Why won't he come over here?
[170:00.65]Oh, my God.
[170:09.73]Come on, get over here.
[170:13.80]Get over here.
[170:14.60]Why are you doing this?
[170:30.21]Little one!
[170:36.30]Tarzan!
[170:48.01]Please, I have 30 bullets.
[170:51.25]Please.
[170:51.85]I saw a little one running around.
[170:56.70]I'm going to go super slow.
[170:59.66]Like, extra slow.
[171:00.90]Because... Is there... I think I'm just going to throw some grenades down there.
[171:13.47]Because there is a little one.
[171:16.01]I saw it run over here.
[171:29.62]Do I just have to get on the elevator?
[171:33.22]Where is it?
[171:33.58]Do you see it?
[171:34.52]I don't hear it.
[171:46.01]Oh my god!
[171:46.49]I heard it, I heard it.
[171:48.77]Where is it?
[171:55.43]Where was it?
[171:56.33]Was it on the right side?
[171:57.31]Back up, back up, back up, back up!
[172:06.59]That's so bad.
[172:08.29]Where was it?
[172:09.83]It was laughing at you.
[172:13.70]It was one of the ones from the big guys that died.
[172:16.08]It just starts walking around down here.
[172:19.02]Okay, I'm gonna do something that might seem a little ridiculous, but I'm gonna go for it.
[172:31.43]That's too dangerous.
[172:32.24]That's really bad.
[172:33.06]It's very dangerous.
[172:35.28]No, no, no.
[172:35.96]I know.
[172:36.32]I know.
[172:36.56]It's very dangerous.
[172:37.34]It's not a good idea.
[172:38.20]It's a very bad idea.
[172:42.67]Is he over there?
[172:44.15]I think I just saw a movement.
[172:46.91]I don't know.
[172:47.33]I have no idea.
[173:09.06]You motherfucker, you're standing right here.
[173:10.96]I knew you were over here.
[173:12.72]Oh my god, he was trying to kill me.
[173:14.72]He was trying to kill me.
[173:16.36]He was trying to kill me.
[173:18.12]He was trying to kill me.
[173:19.30]I have 17 bullets left in this gun.
[173:22.58]I have 17 bullets.
[173:24.86]So, honest to god, I hope that was the last enemy that I need to get rid of.
[173:30.16]Run now, but I can't run now.
[173:35.08]There's another one over here somewhere.
[173:37.06]Just gotta land the shot.
[173:39.52]Oh my god.
[173:40.20]Oh my god.
[173:41.66]Oh my god.
[173:43.36]I don't know.
[173:47.27]Oh my god.
[173:48.03]Oh my god.
[173:59.38]That.
[174:00.58]I did it.
[174:01.04]I can't.
[174:01.82]That's not over.
[174:20.82]That's too much stress.
[174:31.34]Am I gonna get a... Health pack?
[174:47.53]It's okay, because I restart the level.
[174:49.59]I don't- I restart the level.
[174:52.37]It's- don't worry.
[174:53.09]Everything's fine.
[174:54.79]It was a new screen.
[174:56.27]It was a new area.
[174:59.48]See?
[175:00.98]Thank God.
[175:02.92]There he is.
[175:03.46]I just have to make the shot.
[175:10.69]I'm so fucking glad I don't have to do that again.
[175:25.32]Please give me a health pack.
[175:27.66]I... I deserve it.
[175:28.98]I earned it.
[175:31.74]That was a no scope?
[175:34.36]Okay.
[175:36.00]I'm just gonna throw grenades.
[175:37.25]I'm just gonna shoot grenades.
[175:38.07]I have like fucking 15 of them.
[175:42.59]I have like... So I have 20... Just fire grenades down the goddamn hallway.
[175:52.78]Fuck it.
[176:39.46]Why is it not fire?
[176:40.91]I swear to God, man, like I'm trying to shoot the gun.
[177:06.37]oh my god ah
[177:38.48]How many motherfuckers exist?
[177:49.74]How many motherfuckers exist?
[177:59.71]How many motherfuckers exist?
[178:04.85]I have to do this with zero HP.
[178:17.64]You have to do a boss fight after this, too.
[178:19.99]Oh, that's fantastic.
[178:23.10]I can't wait.
[178:23.86]I'm looking forward to it.
[179:06.12]How many motherfuckers are there?
[179:19.53]Get warm, get warm.
[179:20.35]Warm up!
[179:24.98]I have health packs.
[179:25.88]I don't have health packs!
[179:32.98]Okay, warmed up.
[179:37.23]What we got?
[179:37.59]Anybody running down here?
[179:42.43]Eat grenade to heal.
[179:44.39]If only.
[179:45.79]If only that were real.
[179:46.87]Alright, I need dual headphones for this one.
[179:51.21]Get the hair out of my face.
[179:55.11]There's something to blow up over here.
[179:58.37]Right there.
[180:01.98]How we doing?
[180:02.44]Who's there?
[180:03.20]One guy?
[180:03.66]I wonder, can I sneak it?
[180:07.65]Wait till he comes over here.
[180:15.03]Oh, shit!
[180:19.09]Okay, warm up.
[180:29.42]This rubber banding is killing me.
[180:35.70]I might have to snipe that guy.
[180:41.16]I'm gonna go for it.
[180:43.03]I have to land this shot, though.
[180:44.75]If I don't land this shot, then it's over.
[180:51.76]I get one chance.
[181:38.37]Ain't gonna fool me.
[181:39.95]Not at this stage.
[181:46.97]Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold.
[181:49.47]I'm cold.
[181:50.05]Go back there.
[181:50.53]Go back.
[181:51.17]Go back.
[181:51.47]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[182:01.65]It's cold, I'm good.
[182:09.27]Okay, I'm fine.
[182:13.84]Back again.
[182:16.34]I can't imagine there's that much left.
[182:21.70]Shoot the flamethrower for warmth.
[182:24.10]That doesn't work.
[182:26.50]No, I don't believe you.
[182:27.31]And I'm afraid to do it because I have zero HP.
[182:33.29]Alright, where we at?
[182:39.18]Careful, careful.
[183:07.69]Okay.
[183:37.70]Spotted.
[184:12.36]I was doing so well.
[184:15.50]And then the most arbitrarily stupid game mechanic that has only shown up twice in the entire game.
[184:28.15]It's from the movie.
[184:32.97]I can't fucking believe it.
[184:38.07]This shit is fucking wild.
[184:40.68]Whack!
[184:41.84]As... It's whack.
[184:44.08]This shit's whack.
[184:46.06]That's the best term for it.
[185:07.09]This game sucks.
[185:08.49]Omega lul.
[185:12.79]Now I gotta do this shit again.
[185:14.02]I'm gonna have to muscle memory this entire fucking level.
[185:22.80]There's a cave.
[185:23.52]Dude, if I get one bullet, I die.
[185:26.46]I was like doing so fucking well.
[185:30.01]Juggling back and forth, killing guy, wait, get the guy, and no.
[185:34.47]If you stay outside, you get cold and you die.
[185:40.73]This has happened twice in 14 hours of video game.
[185:54.89]I'm fucked and now I'm gonna watch the end on YouTube.
[186:02.97]Look, if that shit was throughout the whole game and it was like a core mechanic of the video game,
[186:08.62]No, it's just been like, it's been in like 12 minutes of gameplay.
[186:12.65]What's the point?
[186:14.09]It doesn't have a point.
[186:16.63]Why can't the guy just go like, oh, it's cold out.
[186:18.67]I don't understand.
[186:19.67]It doesn't do anything.
[186:20.37]I shot myself in the head with the sniper.
[186:35.31]Cave, cave, cave, cave, cave.
[186:37.55]Wait, you mean like cave in?
[187:08.78]you can't even see me damn it
[187:38.58]Come on.
[187:39.30]I can't... If that guy shot me aiming like that, I would have been fucking furious.
[187:56.67]Cave on left coming up.
[187:57.81]Cave on left coming up.
[187:58.71]Hold on.
[188:05.15]He's so angry.
[188:07.33]Wouldn't you be?
[188:08.69]Wouldn't you be?
[188:12.61]See, we don't get to see.
[188:15.35]We don't get to see you playing this game and going like this.
[188:18.99]Like, ah.
[188:21.10]Fuck!
[188:22.06]Fuck!
[188:23.20]Yeah, right?
[188:23.72]Like you do, and you don't want to wake up your mother over there, so you just go like... I know.
[188:29.58]I know.
[188:33.92]I know.
[188:58.15]Just hurry up and crouch walk over here.
[189:01.75]Both of you.
[189:04.59]That's all of you?
[189:06.95]Okay, where's this cave?
[189:07.86]You got a special cave?
[189:09.52]Let me just headshot this guy real quick.
[189:18.20]Damn it.
[189:19.34]What cave?
[189:21.95]I gotta go back.
[189:22.35]I have to run back now.
[189:24.11]What cave?
[189:27.19]Alright, the guy's not showing up.
[189:28.19]He's not showing up.
[189:28.83]I gotta go back.
[189:33.07]There's no cave.
[189:33.55]There's no cave.
[189:33.97]There's no cave.
[189:34.75]There's no cave.
[189:35.51]There's no cave.
[189:37.95]There's no cave.
[189:42.65]Honey?
[189:43.47]Yeah?
[189:44.63]Is everything okay in there?
[189:46.50]Yeah, I just, uh... I just dropped something.
[189:50.70]Okay, you sure?
[189:53.42]Yeah.
[189:54.59]I just dropped something.
[189:55.43]It startled me.
[189:57.13]It startled me a little.
[190:06.72]And then the door closes and you're just like... But you know, you can't... You've already burnt your fucking, like, mom came in the room cool down.
[190:20.45]So you can't do it again.
[190:48.13]Did you guys hear the speedrun of this game?
[190:50.15]We listened for less than 30 seconds and it was like, fuck this game!
[190:53.71]This game sucks!
[190:55.72]And that was just a random portion of the speedrun.
[190:58.80]And those of you who might be asking, well, Termo, just fucking turn it off.
[191:08.06]I can't.
[191:10.24]I don't know why.
[191:10.78]I can't do it.
[191:12.22]I can't fucking, I can't do it.
[191:14.54]I've gotta do this.
[191:15.50]I have to play this.
[191:16.52]It's just the way it is.
[191:24.14]Come on, go.
[191:30.82]I don't have time for this.
[191:34.99]The zero HP run has to be finished.
[191:38.23]Target spotted.
[191:39.17]Where the fuck are you?
[191:40.35]Oh my god.
[191:43.23]That was a stress burp.
[192:12.10]Go back, go back, go back.
[192:15.34]Snipe them.
[192:16.44]It doesn't work that way.
[192:17.48]If I turn the corner and snipe, one of them is going to shoot me with one bullet and I'm dead.
[192:30.60]If you miss the cave, I'm going to leave.
[192:32.16]There is no cave.
[192:33.92]You just want to leave.
[192:35.34]And that's alright.
[192:36.58]There is no cave.
[192:37.36]You just want to leave.
[192:38.88]You don't have to make that excuse.
[192:39.92]You can just go.
[192:40.82]It's cold.
[192:41.68]Hold on.
[192:45.92]Cave in area with sniper.
[192:52.25]There is a cave.
[192:55.49]No, there's no cave.
[192:57.45]There's no cave.
[192:58.33]Why am I talking like this?
[193:01.18]Okay.
[193:07.00]Where's the cave?
[193:21.11]Where's- There's a cave.
[193:23.23]I'm so much- I'm in so much fucking trouble right now.
[193:26.89]I pulled that guy before.
[193:29.55]I can't reach from there.
[193:30.33]I got to snipe this guy.
[193:31.29]Where's the other guy?
[193:31.83]Alright, here he comes.
[193:33.25]Here he comes.
[193:33.79]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[193:41.72]Is that the last anymore?
[193:43.22]I can... Go back.
[193:53.44]Okay, if there's a cave up there, I will give you a wink and say, cool, there's a cave over there.
[193:59.37]That's all you're getting.
[194:09.00]If I could even take one single bullet, it would be not as horrible.
[194:18.97]Alright, there's a guy right here.
[194:20.69]He's standing there.
[194:21.47]I have to snipe him.
[194:23.11]There's no other way.
[194:26.20]I have to hit this guy with a bullet in the head.
[194:28.44]Or at least close enough.
[194:33.62]Where the fuck is he?
[194:55.28]There's another guy right here.
[194:59.76]Is there?
[195:04.75]It's cold.
[195:05.19]It's cold.
[195:05.39]I gotta run back.
[195:05.81]It's cold.
[195:06.15]It's too cold.
[195:06.59]Too cold.
[195:11.91]Here comes the cave.
[195:12.53]Here comes the cave.
[195:13.41]Wait.
[195:13.77]Just wait a minute.
[195:14.25]I don't think this is a cave.
[195:17.51]I can't.
[195:18.25]Just wait.
[195:18.81]I need to go back here.
[195:20.35]There's a cave on the left and the right.
[195:21.47]There's no cave.
[195:28.80]He doesn't trust us?
[195:30.76]No, of course I don't!
[195:32.92]Why would I trust... Everyone's... It's like 40% of people are actively trying to get me to die!
[195:39.44]What do you mean, why can't I trust?
[195:43.39]There's no way!
[195:44.13]Okay, you're telling me there's a cave to the left and the right?
[195:49.57]Those are not caves, they're indents!
[195:53.55]This doesn't do anything!
[195:58.17]That doesn't do anything.
[196:01.05]Other side.
[196:01.83]Other side.
[196:02.37]I have to kill this guy.
[196:03.55]Wait.
[196:06.54]Holy shit, you were lying.
[196:07.80]Oh my god.
[196:08.42]Oh my... Not only is there a cave here, there's like full... Thank you.
[196:25.07]I guess.
[196:26.15]Thanks a lot.
[196:35.47]Oh, so there's a secret cave.
[196:36.51]Okay.
[196:37.09]Whatever.
[196:37.89]Whatever.
[196:38.35]Oh, there's a secret cave that you didn't get.
[196:44.00]Now we need a save point.
[196:47.46]Holy shit, there's a person here.
[196:48.60]Okay.
[197:05.07]Okay.
[197:10.43]What is that?
[197:11.07]You are inside.
[197:11.87]This is not even a cave.
[197:16.82]This is a fucking underdwelling.
[197:18.52]This is a hobbit hole.
[197:20.82]Cave would be, like, bigger.
[197:22.96]Okay.
[197:36.36]I'm just gonna stay in the hole.
[197:38.94]Why haven't I come out?
[197:50.35]There's a guy with a flamethrower right here.
[197:53.65]And you're alive.
[197:55.29]Fantastic.
[197:55.81]I don't know how that's possible.
[198:04.32]Holy shit, he's doing the thing I'm doing!
[198:07.32]Wow!
[198:08.88]Oh, that's... Holy shit, that's ridiculous.
[198:18.55]Okay.
[198:20.91]Alright.
[198:24.25]Good, let's go.
[198:24.83]Remember, cave right there.
[198:26.95]I knew there was a cave there.
[198:52.12]it's a sniper
[199:02.27]Nice aim.
[199:08.49]How about this aim?
[199:09.21]How about this aim?
[199:24.69]It's cold.
[199:25.13]It's too cold.
[199:38.80]Why can't there be a save point in there?
[199:41.37]What were they thinking?
[199:43.29]What were they doing?
[200:07.09]One, two...
[200:10.96]I'm getting like an itchy body now.
[200:12.42]Another cave?
[200:26.13]Cave.
[200:26.73]Cold.
[200:27.49]Too cold.
[200:27.91]Too cold.
[200:28.31]Way too cold.
[200:42.23]Okay, get in the cave.
[200:48.61]How's my IBS?
[200:50.62]I have IBD, but same thing.
[200:53.58]Kind of.
[200:54.18]Same general idea.
[200:57.62]It's really fucking annoying, actually, but I'm not even sure that's what the problem is right now.
[201:02.12]I'm having all kinds of strange medical mishaps.
[201:13.79]He's not dead?
[201:14.43]Didn't I shoot him in the head?
[201:39.36]Another place to go?
[201:40.20]Another... Is it too cold?
[201:41.43]Get back to the cave.
[201:45.78]Cave.
[201:59.65]Safety cave.
[202:01.07]Yeah, there's another cave.
[202:04.09]Where's the other cave?
[202:21.18]He's nerd-necking.
[202:23.90]Slightly.
[202:24.50]Very slightly.
[202:27.73]You guys want me to click a link when I'm in the middle of, like, the end of this game that's been very hard for me?
[202:32.81]I'm gonna alt-tab right now and click a link.
[202:35.15]I don't know if I can't.
[202:49.20]Where's the other cave you guys are talking about?
[202:52.21]There's gotta be something back here, like a secret, like a health pack.
[202:55.80]Yeah, of course there is something back here.
[202:58.21]Of course there is.
[203:22.10]Can I get a fucking save point?
[203:29.06]Save point.
[203:35.46]Game over, Whitley.
[203:40.06]I didn't even know he was standing there.
[203:45.59]I don't think so.
[203:48.13]I control you.
[203:50.45]right now I control every man on this continent oh your pathetic sabotage of the consignment at the airstrip only delayed the inevitable it's been him the whole time there is an evac team on its way to this location once I take the chopper I will begin global infection game over this game is just beginning oh great that was chapter one

[204:32.80]And all... Man.
[204:37.50]Is this gonna... Is there any cheats for this one?
[204:39.46]Is there any cheat codes for this one?
[204:43.04]Like stand still and he can't kill you?
[204:45.10]He can't hurt you?
[204:45.62]Can I jump?
[204:47.02]Can I jump?
[204:56.88]What are you doing in here?
[205:04.61]Holy shit!
[205:25.34]What happened?
[205:25.96]Did someone just walk into that?
[205:30.17]Wow, what an idiot.
[205:35.17]Someone just acted.
[205:49.14]Just took unnecessary damage like big time, but I had to see what was gonna happen These guys are
[206:17.97]Boneheads.
[206:19.65]Boneheads!
[206:20.23]I need some saving ammo.

[207:40.02]I'm playing a different Stephen King novel now?

[208:43.11]He controls them.
[208:43.87]You don't control me.
[208:44.67]I
[208:47.25]Otherwise I wouldn't have shot that C4.
[208:48.49]Fuck this guy.
[209:24.58]Oops-a-daisy.
[209:29.78]Somebody died?
[209:30.48]That was like three people.
[209:41.38]Somebody else walked over the C4.
[209:44.37]Oh my god, this is so stupid.
[209:49.23]I don't even... I can't even react to this anymore.

[210:56.75]It has to be.

[211:10.74]I hope it's easy.
[211:11.38]Where am I going?
[211:16.54]Uh... I think eventually I'll end up back where I was.
[211:37.07]Got it.
[211:40.60]Done.
[212:01.09]I can feel my face being strange.
[212:07.73]I can hear it.
[212:08.80]I can hear the, like... It's weird.
[212:16.82]Okay.
[212:18.12]Let's go.
[212:18.64]Final encounter.
[212:21.08]Let's go.
[212:21.57]Done with this shit.
[212:24.85]Let's do it.
[212:26.25]And it's cold outside.
[212:27.97]And there are... They all have snipers.
[213:03.44]Is that it?
[213:12.99]That's it.
[213:14.13]That's it.
[213:14.53]That's it.
[213:14.87]That's it.
[213:15.19]That's it.
[213:15.51]That's it.
[213:16.01]Up.
[213:16.43]Up.
[213:27.11]This is not a shelter though, is it?
[214:06.87]This is one of those games that, like, you go to Blockbuster and you rent this game.
[214:11.30]And the first, like, six, the first, like, five to six hours are like, great.
[214:15.04]Oh, that was awesome.
[214:15.96]We rented the thing.
[214:17.38]And then you have to return it.
[214:18.94]Don't get a late fee for this one.
[214:23.64]You know what I'm saying?
[214:27.83]Just play the first, like, four hours of it.
[214:29.51]It was good.
[214:29.99]The first, like, four to six hours.
[214:31.23]And then bring it back to Blockbuster.
[214:34.11]You don't have to play this game again.
[214:44.45]Am I okay behind these boxes?
[214:47.15]I think so.
[214:47.75]I should be, right?
[214:53.43]But I'm fighting the cold, too.
[215:19.12]Thanks for standing still and then not like wanker I have to go now.
[215:30.63]I have to go now
[215:37.61]Is it warm in here?
[215:39.27]It's not.
[215:40.12]It's not warm in here.
[215:41.94]It's not warm in here.
[215:42.84]It's not warm in here.
[215:43.52]I have to leave now.
[215:44.24]It's not warm in here.
[215:48.35]Oh, sorry.
[215:48.73]Just two broken legs.
[215:50.07]I don't have any doubts.
[216:13.94]It wants me to use this, that's for sure.
[216:20.36]Where the fuck am I supposed to go from here?
[216:21.88]Is there no save point?
[216:37.92]Why are my pupils the size of raisins?
[216:43.81]I don't know.
[216:44.31]What's that mean?
[216:44.91]It means you're on drugs.
[217:07.02]I can assure you I'm not.
[217:08.10]Um...
[217:13.02]Okay.
[217:14.16]So... This way?
[217:26.66]This is a way to go.
[217:27.50]I- I just took damage.
[217:35.75]What was the- I took damage.
[217:38.51]That was bullshit.
[217:43.23]Oh, that's the kind of- that's the sound of my cat- my cat puke.
[217:46.07]Whatever that- that's too loud for me to talk.
[218:01.51]Finally, I get to be outside an area that's not tiny.
[218:06.01]I get to actually- look at how huge this is, too.
[218:08.29]Thank God!
[218:23.43]Are we just leaving?
[218:24.11]Do we just leave?
[218:32.99]Need some help?
[218:34.03]Yeah, no shit.
[218:35.53]I need you to circle close.
[218:37.35]Once I fire, you got 10 seconds to get this chopper as far away as you can.
[218:45.60]Why is it all blue?
[219:07.86]Burn him!
[219:18.31]Shoot that thing?
[219:24.55]Hey, easy!
[219:25.71]Easy while you're driving.
[219:40.44]Shoot it!
[219:57.40]Why did I get all the grenade launchers for?
[220:26.13]That's not it.
[220:27.27]Excellent timing there, pilot.
[220:29.03]Early retirement from Gen Inc?
[220:32.05]No, not exactly.
[220:33.69]On my way back from an extended Arctic vacation.
[220:37.29]Uh-huh.
[220:38.09]So what's your name, smartass?
[220:39.31]Is that Kurt Russell?
[220:40.89]McCready.
[220:43.99]RJ McCready.
[220:45.61]US outpost, North 31.
[220:50.82]He's just the helicopter guy.
[220:53.88]Thanks, Kurt Russell.
[220:59.77]We don't even get a song.
[221:03.19]The guy called for dinner.
[221:10.40]That's it.
[221:10.94]That's the credits song.
[221:18.01]It was just the start.
[221:19.11]It was the two chords and edit.
[221:21.75]That's all we get.
[221:28.27]The game ending ruins the movie ending.
[221:34.50]Why did it give me a huge stockpile of weapons?
[221:40.48]What was my least favorite part?
[221:45.54]All of today.
[221:55.87]Give or take.
[222:00.24]Look at the link.
[222:00.88]Alright, hold on.
[222:01.58]That might be like a secret after credits scene.
[222:11.06]Hold on.
[222:11.40]Wait, wait, wait.
[222:12.00]What if this is an after credits scene?
[222:16.05]This isn't Marvel.
[222:17.71]This is before Marvel.
[222:20.89]The thing came out in the 50s.
[222:21.93]Okay, what are you linking?
[222:36.75]Let's see what it looks like.
[222:46.54]I know that you like separated my eyes.
[222:51.34]You separated my eyes.
[222:54.98]Look.
[223:02.97]You took my eyes and you like separated them a little bit.
[223:08.03]That's not, that's not, I'm telling you these are not real images.
[223:13.29]You went like this and you shaved, shaved, shaved and then you like pulled back a little and then you like made the bridge of my nose bigger.
[223:24.88]Oh my god.
[223:31.32]We're gaslighting him.
[223:35.34]Oh.
[223:36.80]Well that was the thing.
[223:39.43]It was worth playing.
[223:40.17]Except for the last three hours.
[223:46.64]But I did it.
[223:48.46]I got to the end.
[223:51.50]Scale of 1 to 10.
[223:52.28]The first six hours was like an 8.
[223:53.82]And the last five or six hours was like a 4.
[224:03.95]Now do it on hard.
[224:07.41]I did do it on hard.
[224:12.05]Absolute quality.
[224:15.35]Now play the Outer Worlds.
[224:17.91]So... Here's... Let me... Wait, I gotta talk... We gotta talk about a few things here.
[224:23.21]So... As of the... Oh, man.
[224:25.71]This is... I gotta sit down for this one.
[224:29.72]So... All personalities' voices are impersonated.
[224:36.84]Okay.
[224:38.66]So... I...
[224:42.53]The Halloween stream is going to be on the 31st.
[224:45.05]It's going to be fairly elaborate.
[224:46.75]If you have anything that you'd like to suggest, right, for Secret Slime Actions, that channel is going to be closed on the 28th.
[224:58.23]There's not going to be any more time to do it.
[225:00.51]Because after the 28th, I need to compile with the people that are helping me produce this whole thing all the actions and get them into a...
[225:10.33]template for the stream and I can't see them I I cannot be looking at them how do we pick and we vote for them you don't I just want a shitload to pull from so then there's a ton of options how many per round that is to be determined probably probably we'll do like one or two per round until we get later on
[225:32.08]to a point where there's like some upwards of like five to ten going on at the same time so this also means because this was kind of short notice and the production team that did the carnival was doing is helping me do this too they're doing they're doing all the production stuff it was too soon to do this in Vegas
[225:53.99]So I'm going back to the East Coast as of this coming week here.
[226:01.14]So I'm going back to the East Coast and I'm going to kind of do a two birds with one stone scenario where I go visit my family.
[226:11.59]So I'm going to visit my family because I haven't seen a lot of them in a long time.
[226:15.49]I haven't seen some of my family members and some of my friends in just over a year.
[226:20.33]So I was in Boston like three or four, I think four months ago, whatever it was, maybe for a day or two.
[226:27.02]I'm trying to remember when the exact day was.
[226:29.24]But I really only had like one or two days there.
[226:32.62]So I'm going to go down there, do the stream, so I won't be around next week.
[226:38.24]Go down there, do the stream, and then I'm going to stay for a few days, and then come back.
[226:45.85]So... Take a hot air balloon back.
[226:49.67]That takes too long.
[226:51.05]Oh, okay.
[227:00.82]But yeah, that's... So... I'm not... The Halloween stream is not going to be here.
[227:06.20]Not going to be in Vegas.
[227:06.92]I'm going to be traveling for it.
[227:08.90]And that's pretty much all I wanted to say.
[227:12.04]Also, another important thing to remember is I still have Bushido Blade and Bushido Blade 2.
[227:20.53]In fact, they're right here.
[227:23.25]That is something that I want to do probably...
[227:31.86]I don't know if I want to start.
[227:33.02]That's the thing about starting something like The Outer Worlds.
[227:35.70]I have to play The Outer Worlds because it's Fallout New Vegas.
[227:38.50]Just, again, different.
[227:41.68]I want to play it.
[227:43.92]But, before starting The Outer Worlds, I think I'm going to wait until I get back from the Halloween stream.
[227:53.91]Because I don't want to just play it for, like, one day and then disappear for three days, do the Halloween stream, and then come back three days later.
[228:02.44]So, we'll do, tomorrow, we'll do Bushido Blade and Bushido Blade 2.
[228:09.22]Because they're classic, uh, they're classic video games, and might as well get rid of the rest of the PS1 stuff that's here.
[228:15.73]And we'll see how that takes us.
[228:17.29]See how we go from there.
[228:20.79]I also have Siren.
[228:21.95]That's another one.
[228:23.01]Shit.
[228:23.29]That's right.
[228:23.95]I gotta do that before Halloween.
[228:26.17]Bushido Blade and Bushido Blade 2 won't take that long.
[228:29.43]Oh, fuck.
[228:29.85]Siren's like a 30-hour game.
[228:31.99]Whatever.
[228:32.29]Fucking... Happy Halloween Thanksgiving.
[228:35.07]Whatever.
[228:38.55]Shit.
[228:41.25]I've applied like four times.
[228:44.22]And that is going to be the end of this stream.
[228:46.10]But it's not.
[228:47.10]Because we're going to go back.
[228:48.42]This is going to turn into just a chill session.
[228:52.20]We're going to do the bits that I missed from a couple days ago.
[228:54.89]Three or four days ago.
[228:59.15]Let me just use the bathroom.
[229:02.43]The stream is officially over.
[229:04.51]As of right now.
[229:06.19]So let's go over the bits that we missed.
[229:09.68]And I will be right back.
[229:13.08]See you guys in a minute.
[230:24.25]Alright.
[230:25.47]We can get started here.
[230:29.69]With the outro.
[230:39.54]I can't even tell if this is still broken or not.
[230:43.14]Because there's been such insane gifted subs.
[230:47.57]I think this is from a few days ago.
[230:49.95]But, so, because we're doing two streams worth of bits, and this last stream was nine and a half hours, so... We're going to try to go through these at a decent pace.
[230:59.75]I know we say that all the time, but it has to happen now.
[231:05.83]Because it has to.
[231:09.03]Two hours later.
[231:09.83]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[231:10.81]What time is it? 9.09?
[231:13.44]See you in like, see you in like 35 minutes, alright?
[231:15.60]How about that?
[231:16.14]How's that sound?
[231:17.10]Anyways, this is from a few days ago.
[231:18.50]I didn't do these.
[231:19.12]I missed them.
[231:20.30]I had to go.
[231:21.14]I streamed for too long, and my stomach was all fucked up.
[231:23.84]So, here we are now.
[231:26.18]Uh, we had 250 Bits from Peaceful Haley.
[231:28.14]They said, Hey, Jeremy, how you doing?
[231:29.79]Hope all is well.
[231:30.55]Just wanted to ask if you're planning on going to Galaxy's Edge at Disney.
[231:35.71]Uh, probably not anytime soon.
[231:40.38]I know many people are very happy with it right now, but I hope for the last one, anyways, have a good stream.
[231:44.96]Talking about... Oh, building a lightsaber.
[231:48.14]Oh, shit, you can build a lightsaber there, like a real one.
[231:51.54]Well, it's not real, but... Is it, though?
[231:57.97]Those things are shit.
[231:59.73]What?
[232:03.01]Probably not.
[232:05.14]I don't have any plans in the immediate future to go to Galaxy's Edge.
[232:10.08]I kind of want to wait until nobody cares anymore.
[232:13.24]And then just get to go on all the rides.
[232:15.69]And just get to eat all the food and not have to wait in line for anything.
[232:19.37]So, I don't know.
[232:19.99]I'll probably go like summer of 2020.
[232:23.91]But yeah.
[232:25.36]I am interested.
[232:27.72]All two of the rides.
[232:28.82]Oh yeah, there's only two rides.
[232:31.12]But aren't they good though?
[232:36.94]galaxy's edge is already empty oh well maybe I'll go soon I don't know but thank you fitty for the 550 bits yo my dude man person I really appreciate you making the streams more EU friendly can I get some slugs in the chat yeah I'm happy to pull it back a couple hours because it's better for me too can we get some slugs
[233:02.77]Also, Fitty for $5.50, they say, adding to my previous message, it's okay that the past few streams have been a little bit shorter.
[233:08.75]We understand how tough it can be for streaming for eight hours while on thermonuclear laxatives.
[233:14.94]Yes.
[233:19.80]This is true.
[233:25.99]But,
[233:28.22]I am not on them anymore.
[233:30.36]I'm on another medication still, though.
[233:33.94]And it's really... It's just fucking me up.
[233:37.40]But not to the point where I have to stream for like two or three hours and then leave.
[233:41.65]That only happened one time, though.
[233:45.25]There was only two streams all of last week, or all the last two weeks, that were like three to five hours long.
[233:51.43]So, it worked out okay.
[233:55.59]But yeah, thank you.
[233:56.19]Appreciate the concern.
[233:59.92]uh not even close it was alright thank you plank for the 550 bits there's a fun fact quentin tarantino's movie the hateful eight was loosely based off the 1982 film the thing he also used unused music from the original score of the thing and of course Kurt Russell interesting

[235:34.90]It's not nice.
[235:36.46]Can't we just talk?
[235:46.31]Hey, thank you, Wreckers D. Wreckers said for the 250.

[236:03.71]I'm from Northern Ireland and as of midnight here, same-sex marriage was made legal.
[236:09.40]That's pretty sick.
[236:12.00]Is that for real?
[236:18.32]Did that actually just happen?
[236:22.10]Oh, well, nice.
[236:23.00]That's good.
[236:31.09]That's really good.
[236:32.35]Good to know.
[236:33.65]Breaking news from four days ago.
[236:41.54]Phylacterlich just gave another 5,000 bits on top of their, like, 10 grand from four days ago.
[236:47.76]They say, hey, Jerma, here's the money I owe you for letting me use your blood.
[236:50.23]Weird results, though.
[236:50.95]Might want to see a doctor because the blood tried to eat me.
[236:54.09]Because I am the fucking thing.
[237:01.80]this is where it gets crazy because there was like seven or eight thousand dollars four days ago and I'm not making that up that's not like a laugh out loud holy there's like seven there was like seven or eight thousand dollars four days ago uh so this is it gets nuts here and I tried to go over as many as I could a few days ago but if there's any that I missed let's see if I can pick them out because holy it was over 8k I it could I yes
[237:33.36]Hey, you guys ready to watch more thing in a few days?
[237:37.40]Ishanji was one of those people that gave a ton, and this is a thousand bit message.
[237:41.79]Chat, take bits test to prove you aren't infected.
[237:45.67]Well, you did.
[237:47.69]You did.
[237:48.81]You did.
[237:53.60]You did.
[237:54.44]Trust me, you did.
[237:57.02]Because about five to ten minutes after that,
[238:03.43]It went insane.
[238:13.86]Thank you, StreakyKL, for the thousand bits.
[238:16.46]Why does this exist?
[238:18.72]What is it?
[238:19.78]Jerma versus Star AMV.
[238:25.39]I don't know why this exists.
[238:30.01]Is this something we're going to watch on Community Content Night?
[238:32.70]Or should I not?
[238:33.68]Is this... Alright, I... I'm going to copy this because it might even be in the Discord already, but I'm going to save this when I come back.
[238:51.71]This looks pretty fucked.
[239:00.66]They paid money now.
[239:04.18]No, I have a very specific rule.
[239:06.29]If you have a community created video or artwork, we do it on the community created nights.
[239:12.99]I've made that clear like 10 times.
[239:19.59]If they pay money, you have to show and do it on community.
[239:22.23]What?
[239:22.41]What do you mean now?
[239:29.29]What about links in chat?
[239:32.08]Yeah, a link in chat for like a face edit is not a three and a half minute fucking video.
[239:39.22]This video's five years old?
[239:40.88]What?
[239:56.97]Hold on.
[239:59.06]This was not made like last week.
[240:00.76]This was made like fucking five years ago.
[240:03.38]This is fucking freaking me out.
[240:10.44]That man gave you a thousand dollars for this.
[240:12.62]No, they didn't.
[240:18.00]No, they did not.
[240:19.20]It was ten dollars and it was really, really appreciated.
[240:25.28]Why do you have a theater screen?
[240:27.70]For this!
[240:40.84]alright let's alright fine I will I will watch at least 30 seconds of this video he was peer pressured peer pressured for 30 seconds is this even gonna

[241:19.12]Don't start playing- Stop!
[241:22.88]No, it's gonna play the f- Fucking frog video again!
[241:27.35]Stop!
[241:28.01]I don't want to play this one.
[241:36.13]God damn it, man.
[241:37.83]No, get over here!
[241:41.56]Why is this permanently saved?
[241:43.18]Alright, here you go.
[242:00.39]Let's see.
[242:09.55]Something's wrong with you.
[242:12.47]I see your eyes.
[242:14.32]Alright, well, thanks.
[242:15.74]The VOD's gonna be destroyed from this.
[242:19.04]As I turn the state of... Empty in my arms.
[242:27.85]You pushed aside.
[242:30.47]Wondered if you'd ever be all...
[242:35.55]What the fuck was this from?
[242:39.53]Where did you get this picture from?
[243:08.15]Oh, that's when I smashed my fucking face.
[243:14.52]That's when I hit my fucking head.
[243:17.04]Like really hard.
[243:22.90]What do you mean story time?
[243:27.25]I made a video on it like fucking seven years ago.
[243:37.35]It's not even a fucking cool story.
[243:39.21]It's just a fucking sad one.
[243:43.59]I got up too fast waking up in the morning and like have low blood pressure.
[243:50.00]That's it.
[243:50.98]That's the story.
[243:58.58]Play that video instead.
[244:00.11]No.
[244:02.51]But the scar.
[244:03.31]I don't have a scar.
[244:07.52]God damn it.
[244:08.26]Alright.
[244:08.98]Turn it off.
[244:09.92]Turn it off.
[244:10.92]Turn it off.
[244:11.66]Get out of here.
[244:12.72]Turn it off with the music on.
[244:17.90]I was watching that.
[244:18.74]That's too bad.
[244:20.22]You can watch it any minute of the day.
[244:28.89]He fell down and injured himself.
[244:31.35]It was actually really fucking strange.
[244:34.59]It was very, very strange.
[244:39.16]By the way, I'm fine.
[244:39.91]This was like six and a half years ago.
[244:49.29]Bye.
[244:50.56]Thank you, Streaky KL.
[244:52.20]They said, why does this exist?
[244:53.28]I don't know.
[244:53.72]Because somebody decided to make that video and so I watched it.
[244:57.08]We watched it.
[245:00.74]Thank you, Gnarly, for the 250.
[245:02.02]Gnarly, hey, I need to decide what game I should play.
[245:04.08]I was going to try to beat Luigi's Mansion before Halloween, but I just beat Mother 3, and now I really want to play Mother 3, Mother 2, and Earthbound.
[245:10.83]Which one should I play next?
[245:12.17]Earthbound.
[245:14.51]Absolutely.
[245:15.45]Hands down.
[245:19.25]Yeah.
[245:20.31]Earthbound.
[245:22.23]Got it.
[245:22.73]Done.
[245:23.49]Seal it.
[245:25.39]CVFD, thanks for the thousand bits.
[245:27.69]I'll be your friend, Jerma.
[245:28.73]Thanks.
[245:29.59]Appreciate it.
[245:31.91]Glad that you can be my friend.
[245:36.09]MiniClips, thanks for the thousand bits.
[245:37.35]This stream is a goldmine for noises.
[245:41.11]I think, yeah.
[245:42.37]Any horror game like that is just stressful and horrible.
[245:46.91]But thank you for the thousand bits.
[245:47.97]Appreciate it.
[245:49.74]FreudianWeapon, thanks for the 500 bits.
[245:51.18]The Thing is a personal favorite horror movie of mine.
[245:53.28]The original, by the way.
[245:55.02]I never knew they made a game of it.
[245:57.18]Random question.
[245:58.32]If you could create, direct a horror movie, what would it be?
[246:00.54]Also, thanks for streaming.
[246:03.40]uh it'd be about the and it would be an invisible monster and they'd have to like throw water at it and stuff to like get those glistening so they could see where it was
[246:23.72]No, I'm not talking about, like, it's invisible and it, like, affects your mind.
[246:27.03]No, no, no.
[246:27.49]Like, it's just an invisible monster.
[246:30.13]And they have to, like, spray paint.
[246:31.27]They get, like, spray paint and shit and they, like, they get ready and that's... They get spray paint, they get buckets of water, buckets of ink and stuff.
[246:45.70]This is a Spongebob episode.
[246:48.36]Whatever.
[246:49.88]That's what it'd be.
[246:51.96]Thank you, Sad Vega, for the 250.
[246:54.04]Is definitely a new Jermote emote.
[246:59.22]No.
[247:01.64]This is the face from... Oh, my God.
[247:07.71]Can I tell you guys that I was in bed laughing at this image?
[247:15.43]I was sitting around, seriously, just lying in bed the last, I mean, maybe two nights after that stream.
[247:22.27]I was just, I was fucking dying laughing.
[247:24.47]I was cracking the fuck up.
[247:32.16]Kim was actually sleeping right next to me, and I, I think I woke her up like twice.
[247:37.04]I wasn't even looking at it.
[247:37.88]I was just thinking about it.
[247:47.79]Emote material, though, yes.
[247:50.33]I would say so, too.
[247:53.94]Thank you.
[247:55.48]Hey, Blue!
[247:56.32]Thank you, Blue, for the 550.
[247:58.08]You posted the same image twice.
[248:01.39]What?
[248:03.47]That image?
[248:04.01]I don't know.
[248:05.49]Thank you, Jules, for the 250.
[248:06.71]Hey, Jerma, sorry I haven't been keeping up lately about your stomach problems.
[248:09.86]But I heard that you were on a FODMAP diet.
[248:11.84]Any progress of what types of food you should avoid or what the doctor said?
[248:15.42]I'm not doing it anymore because it didn't really do anything for me.
[248:19.29]I was on it for a few weeks and it just wasn't changing anything.
[248:23.60]And then I had a colonoscopy a few months ago.
[248:28.33]Well, there was these things in there that we wanted.
[248:30.71]Maybe you should try this.
[248:31.93]And maybe you should try this.
[248:33.33]And maybe you should try this.
[248:34.53]And then now I have another... I have another endoscopy I have to do.
[248:42.03]Instead of going up, they're going down.
[248:44.38]So they're going to see if something's going on inside my stomach.
[248:48.18]I don't know.
[248:49.50]It's been a very strange eight months.
[248:52.10]We'll say that.
[248:54.77]I am just not fucking around.
[248:56.85]I'm gonna try to see what the hell is wrong with me.
[249:02.31]Because it may not even be my stomach.
[249:04.67]I don't know.
[249:06.69]It's very, very annoying though.
[249:09.47]We're trying to see what's going on.
[249:11.09]I don't know.
[249:19.55]I'm just... We're just going... We're just... Each appointment...
[249:23.41]What do you want to try now?
[249:24.63]Until we can figure it out.
[249:27.31]That's pretty much it.
[249:28.49]Now I'm going to just keep doing that.
[249:31.93]I have an endoscopy camera.
[249:32.87]Can I help?
[249:35.55]Why do you have one?
[249:37.29]It's weird.
[249:39.35]But, thank you.
[249:40.87]Don't worry about me.
[249:41.41]I'm fine.
[249:43.07]I am in good spirits.
[249:44.33]And then the ball of koala came in with 3800 bits and then 3800 bits.
[249:53.70]My brain is trying to do that math very quickly.
[249:56.45]68.
[249:57.41]And then 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76.
[249:59.31]$76.50.
[249:59.35]This is just no message.
[250:08.34]It was trying to do a money Jupiter.
[250:11.60]It's just... I'm not sure if it went through.
[250:13.84]I hope it did.
[250:15.16]Because that's a very expensive Jupiter.
[250:19.30]Thank you so much, Balla Koala.
[250:23.11]Thank you.
[250:25.59]Thank you C4G for the 250.
[250:26.77]Hey Jerma, bad news.
[250:27.98]The in-house team I usually get to write my chat messages decided to unionize and they went on strike.
[250:32.46]Apparently they want wages.
[250:33.66]I don't know, but when I told them I spent my last 250 on these bits and they got really angry.
[250:41.57]Thanks.
[250:42.99]Thanks for the 250.
[250:46.65]Phylactery, let's just give another 5,000 bits.
[250:50.42]$50 again.
[250:51.28]Again, again.
[250:53.32]Jerba, don't die.
[250:54.38]If you do, I'll have only Etalyx to watch.
[250:56.98]And his goatee makes me feel things.
[251:06.86]Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[251:09.54]And I'm doing fine.
[251:11.40]Don't worry about me.
[251:12.11]I'm fine.
[251:14.22]It's just something I need to figure out what's going on.
[251:16.70]And that's it.
[251:18.76]I'll figure it out.
[251:19.34]Don't worry.
[251:21.08]I always do.
[251:22.76]I always do.
[251:23.36]Appreciate the concern, though.
[251:26.06]Thank you.
[251:29.86]But, hey!
[251:32.01]Uh, Swiggity Swanky, thanks for the $2.50.
[251:33.56]Thank you for playing this fun, fun game.
[251:35.92]I have a fond memory of the film, which was from the old 1950s version my mom let me... 1950s version?
[251:42.64]My mom let me watch.
[251:44.24]One day I asked my amazing, distant dad to watch film again.
[251:48.47]And he showed me the 80s version without any question or doubt in his mind.
[251:52.35]And this was when I was around 10 years old.
[251:54.69]Life was never the same afterwards, for better or worse, I don't know.
[251:57.57]But I have a thing for gore fests.
[252:02.40]Did they actually do a thing from like the fifties?
[252:05.74]I don't remember that.
[252:11.81]It's weird.
[252:14.30]Thank you StixRenegade for the $2.75.
[252:16.32]I remember getting this game back when Benny's used to be around.
[252:19.04]It was $12.
[252:21.06]I bought it at least 12 years ago.
[252:23.17]It was scary and so hard for me.
[252:25.47]I could not beat it at all and had to use cheats.
[252:28.33]I don't know how you like it since I'm watching the VOD five hours after you started.
[252:32.48]Well, you know now.
[252:39.16]Thank you, slow update for the 275.
[252:40.68]How's it going, my man, Jermus?
[252:45.38]100, 9, 87.
[252:45.72]That's not even what you wrote.
[252:49.35]Jermus, 987.
[252:50.11]It is what you wrote.
[252:52.45]Here to tell you that this game is too scary for me, so I will crop everything but the face cam and have it on mute.
[252:58.03]The downside is you'll look like a crackhead screaming for no reason.
[253:01.29]So if you can look like a meth head screaming for no reason, that would greatly improve my viewing experience.
[253:06.24]Anyways, war and hate, peace and love.
[253:09.56]You got it.
[253:14.10]And then this is where it goes completely and totally off the fucking rails.
[253:20.84]There is... I think we got almost all these already four nights ago.
[253:27.60]But it is... I have to... I'm gonna have to scroll.
[253:34.61]It's gonna be like... To get through this.
[253:40.60]And there are some in the middle here that I did not touch upon four days ago.
[253:45.72]But my god.
[253:46.38]Uh, Roidberto gave 1100 bits.
[253:51.14]Fuse us, create me, father.
[253:54.99]I don't know, whatever that means.
[253:57.71]Fuse us.
[253:58.99]Martin had a meme thanks to the 550.
[254:00.33]Dermot, it's time to man up and kill him.
[254:02.89]The only hitbox that matters is the fat dude in the bottom of the monster.
[254:06.11]Use your grenades before ever running out.
[254:07.59]Throw them over the box.
[254:11.56]In the middle of, like, the money stream is, like, advice.
[254:14.46]I love it.
[254:18.47]Thank you, though.
[254:19.53]And thank you to the fucking hundreds.
[254:23.17]I'm just going up.
[254:25.29]Bobboy, thanks for the 500 bits.
[254:27.33]Remember when you had like to spread the infection?
[254:31.06]This stream makes that into a joke years in the making.
[254:35.50]That's true.
[254:36.10]I should have said it at least once.
[254:37.94]I'm not sure why I didn't.
[254:44.14]Oh, I'm looking at all these subs and shit.
[254:47.98]Oh my god.
[254:49.88]StreakyKL, thanks for the 1500 bits in the middle of all this.
[254:52.70]Not as much, but here, add to the pile.
[254:55.57]It was a pile.
[254:58.43]It was... I'm still going.
[255:04.37]ACDCFreak, thanks for the 400 bits.
[255:06.01]It isn't much, but here.
[255:09.84]If you're gonna give this channel money, don't ever think it's not enough.
[255:15.58]Because even if you give a cent, a quarter, it doesn't... I can't believe it, that somebody would do that.
[255:23.50]So, click the link, click the link, click the link.
[255:26.98]What is this?
[255:30.96]Jerma Au.
[255:36.00]What is this?
[255:37.21]Why is it not loading?
[255:38.13]I saw that.
[255:38.57]Alright, what?
[255:40.35]Okay.
[255:42.05]Alright, so why do I need to click this one?
[255:47.85]Oh, this is real!
[255:48.85]Is that real?
[255:49.47]Is that a real picture?
[255:50.51]What?
[255:50.89]Holy shit, that's real.
[255:51.99]Is it?
[255:52.27]No.
[255:58.83]Ay-yay-yay.
[256:00.73]But, yeah.
[256:03.64]I can't even fucking believe.
[256:05.96]It was hard to process when it was happening.
[256:08.24]But looking at it now... This is ridiculous.
[256:12.58]Bait!
[256:13.26]Thank you, bait!
[256:15.11]Naily for the thousand bits.
[256:16.85]Big funding for the next Jerma Rumble.
[256:19.53]I already told you guys that the Halloween stream has already been paid for.
[256:22.95]As of... That stream yesterday paid for it.
[256:29.95]There's more.
[256:30.33]You're linking more of these?
[256:31.33]What is this?
[256:32.47]The single eye.
[256:33.57]Okay.
[256:37.30]You guys are fucking crazy.
[256:42.35]Put that thing back where it came from.
[256:46.89]Thank you, everybody that gave subs and bits four days ago.
[256:50.86]Seriously.
[256:51.84]I'm trying to scroll through and find the ones that we didn't do.
[256:55.68]Avery dropped dead.
[256:56.52]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[256:58.76]They say, hopping on the bit train.
[257:00.06]Hi, Jerma.
[257:00.50]I got a job at Taco Bell.
[257:03.50]couple weeks ago, and I'm so glad I get to finally catch a stream.
[257:08.04]Love you and your content so much, man.
[257:09.42]You're the best.
[257:10.54]We stan a himbo king.
[257:17.44]I honestly don't know what that last sentence means.
[257:24.20]We stan a himbo king.

[257:31.50]Thanks a lot.

[257:59.18]Jeremy, you've helped me keep my mind off some crazy shit I went through over the past year.
[258:03.32]I'm happy to finally be in a place where I can pay back both you and your community for all the good times.
[258:07.38]This stream has been a big mood.
[258:10.72]I think I remember maybe hitting this one.
[258:13.56]But, regardless, that's a fucking incredibly nice message.
[258:16.42]Everybody here is awesome.
[258:19.68]Thank you for the huge amount of money you gave a lot four days ago.
[258:23.65]Thank you.
[258:25.97]And then there are hundreds of community subs.
[258:28.43]Ecap, thanks for the 500 bits.
[258:29.89]I only have bits, but I'm joining in.
[258:31.41]Love your work, Jeremy.
[258:32.25]Thank you.
[258:37.78]Oh my goodness.
[258:38.86]It just keeps going.
[258:43.78]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 275.
[258:44.90]Hey again.
[258:46.18]I just bought my Star Wars tickets since the new trailer dropped.
[258:51.77]Oh yeah, the new Star Wars trailer.
[258:55.58]I was about to just say something that people would be really upset with.
[258:59.12]I'm glad I didn't do it.
[259:00.92]I'm very happy that I just... Zip!
[259:05.91]Because I was about to do something that people would have been like, Dude, what the fuck, man?
[259:10.47]I didn't even know.
[259:11.87]And I would have been like, How do you not know?
[259:14.17]How do you not know?
[259:14.81]The trailer!
[259:15.45]What about the trailer?
[259:16.21]And everyone would have been really mad at me.
[259:19.47]He hasn't seen the trailer.
[259:20.41]Yes, I have.
[259:20.89]I will say one word for you to know that I've seen the trailer.
[259:23.98]Ocean.
[259:24.66]Ocean.
[259:26.77]waves on the ocean that's how you know I've seen the trailer don't tell me I haven't seen the damn trailer but I expect good things from this last movie since George Lucas had some say in it did he that's interesting I thought they like voted him off the island anyways enough to be talking about Star Wars I used to love this game as a kid and I'm glad you had a good time with it have a good night
[260:01.45]Jar Jar's the key to all this.
[260:02.56]That's so fucking funny.
[260:14.24]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[260:15.46]Thank you, Disinterest, for the 250.
[260:17.88]Jerma, people gave you so much to you tonight because they love you for being an extremely entertaining streamer and one of the most genuine, kind-hearted people any of us have ever met.
[260:28.51]I'm floored by that.
[260:30.39]I can't... I'm just trying to do... I'm just trying to do me, you know?
[260:37.50]That's it.
[260:40.08]I don't know if I'm the most genuine person ever.
[260:44.20]I just try to do as best I can.
[260:51.28]That's it.
[260:55.66]You know?
[260:57.28]But I am absolutely floored that you feel that way.
[261:02.23]I mean, you lie sometimes, but we forgive you.
[261:04.15]Yeah, 90% of all the things that I say are not even true.
[261:06.77]I've said that.
[261:07.53]That's a statement.
[261:11.73]Thank you.
[261:13.55]Seriously.
[261:14.73]That means a shitload.
[261:17.21]RT McCabe from four days ago says, 1500 bits.
[261:23.07]Keep it going, you cowards.
[261:25.47]They did.
[261:27.75]They did.
[261:30.15]Feeling his ego.
[261:30.91]Tear him down quick.
[261:31.73]You are bald.
[261:33.19]Oh, shit.
[261:38.41]Thank you, TMKB, for your huge contributions and your 1500 bits.
[261:45.03]Thank you.
[261:46.05]Sroyit, thanks for the 700 bits.
[261:48.21]PogChamps.
[261:49.67]Necromancy Mage, 300 bits.
[261:51.09]Don't let the flame die out.
[261:56.12]Novaz, thanks for the 250 stream.
[261:57.93]It becomes millionaire on stream.
[262:02.17]This is unbelievable.
[262:03.51]I can't even, I can't even understand this.
[262:05.99]I'm just keep scrolling.
[262:08.48]Sage the Ghost, thanks for 500 bits.
[262:10.00]Big love to you, buddy.
[262:10.80]Thanks for always making me laugh.
[262:11.84]Thanks for always watching the streams whenever you can and supporting this live stream of a weird guy on the internet.
[262:22.91]I can't believe it.
[262:24.11]Thank you.
[262:25.93]Did you check the toilet?
[262:27.15]I did.
[262:31.43]He's a weird guy.
[262:32.59]I'm like weird and quirky and odd.
[262:34.94]Right?
[262:36.54]I'm like a weird... Thanks.
[262:37.88]Thank you for supporting this weird quirky stream.
[262:47.84]I get to have him sometimes.
[262:49.20]I get to have him sometimes.
[262:52.48]I'm unfollowing.
[262:53.16]No, please don't.
[262:53.78]Please, God, don't do that.
[262:54.88]Please, God!
[262:58.70]Thank you for supporting this... We're just a couple of... We're just a bunch of like... Alright, I won't.
[263:03.95]I won't.
[263:04.35]I'll stop.
[263:04.95]I'll stop.
[263:05.23]I'll stop.
[263:07.59]The thing broke me?
[263:08.53]Yes, it did.
[263:09.17]Because that game was fucking hell.
[263:11.07]On Earth.
[263:12.37]In a video game.
[263:13.15]Coded.
[263:14.11]To have graphical interfaces show up as monsters.
[263:17.08]And make me angry.
[263:18.96]Just a couple of humans.
[263:21.15]No, sorry.
[263:21.73]Just a couple of humans.
[263:22.87]I can't even say it.
[263:23.55]Just a couple of humans.
[263:24.65]I can't even say it.
[263:27.57]No, but seriously though, all jokes aside, thank you.
[263:31.39]Thanks for watching the stream.
[263:35.72]That was Sage the Ghost with 500 bits.
[263:38.10]Eager Oatmeal 500 bits.
[263:39.38]You deserve every one of those subs, you magnificent bastard.
[263:43.84]I'm glad you think so.
[263:49.59]Thank you.
[263:51.87]Mentosium, thanks for the 500 bits.
[263:53.41]Congrats on recently walking a thousand miles.
[263:57.67]Recently walking a thousand miles?
[264:05.10]You're cold.
[264:05.58]Hurry up.
[264:06.00]Run back in.
[264:06.76]Cold.
[264:07.10]Too many links.
[264:10.76]I like how he pauses when he's flustered.
[264:13.66]He gets flustered.
[264:15.71]Okay, what is this?
[264:19.45]Is this a song?
[264:20.39]Jeremy walks a thousand miles.
[264:23.55]I can't play this.
[264:30.26]It is, okay, this is just me walking.
[264:33.18]This looks fucking good.
[264:34.70]Like, really funny and shit.
[264:36.00]Like, I want to watch this when people are, like, for a community stream.
[264:40.89]Because I don't want to nuke the VOD for tonight's stream when the community content nights can just get nuked.
[264:50.32]Yeah, we're saving this.
[264:51.18]This looks like a lot of effort went into this one.
[264:59.16]Say nuked again.
[265:00.58]Nuked.
[265:00.88]Somebody just wrote, I don't give a shit.
[265:08.87]Show it.
[265:10.97]Easy.
[265:13.11]Come on.
[265:14.05]Easy.
[265:14.43]Come on.
[265:25.54]Jeremy, say the line.
[265:26.46]That guy's pissed.
[265:28.47]Don't be... It's alright.
[265:30.29]Don't worry.
[265:31.37]You'll see it.
[265:32.63]I don't give a shit.
[265:38.34]I actually said five a shit.
[265:41.00]Yes, you did, but I was...
[265:43.91]I was putting a g there because I didn't know if you accidentally pressed f so I mean I do that all the time I write like you know I don't give a I don't like you have a shift you know what I mean admit to say I was just making it so you know what I mean I do that all the time but we'll see it soon because that second community content stream is going to happen
[266:10.93]Just a few days after I get back from the Halloween stream.
[266:15.29]I think that might be the first thing I do.
[266:17.82]We'll see.
[266:18.74]Probably.
[266:19.52]Don't quote me on that.
[266:20.92]But put quotes around this.
[266:25.70]Multitrip gave 5,500 bits.
[266:27.90]I think I caught it, but I'm sorry I can only afford 50 bucks this time.
[266:31.20]Please don't hit me.
[266:32.16]I got it already.
[266:33.24]I remember that one.
[266:34.54]Suchip, thanks for the 2,884 bits.
[266:39.16]I just got here.
[266:39.68]I don't know what this number is.
[266:40.80]Why do we care about it?
[266:48.73]Open the damn meme.
[266:53.52]I have two personalities.
[266:54.94]Nicest person you'll ever meet.
[266:56.40]Twisted fucking psychopath.
[266:58.58]Oh, I hate this.
[267:00.88]I hate this so much.
[267:02.72]It's unbelievable how much I hate this.
[267:11.95]Oh.
[267:14.05]God damn it.
[267:16.43]Necromancy Mage, thanks for the 300 bits.
[267:18.07]Jeremy, use this for a bus ticket out of town before the IRS gets you for money laundering.
[267:25.28]Money... What are you... I'm not supposed to be laughing.
[267:36.76]I have to do a no laughing stream tomorrow.
[267:38.94]Because, like, every time I laugh, my stomach hurts.
[267:46.84]IRS official.
[267:49.13]No, I pay my fucking taxes.
[267:56.04]Yeah, I saw it, I saw it.
[268:02.23]Click the link.
[268:03.29]I did!
[268:03.73]I did!
[268:04.55]I did!
[268:05.21]I have two personalities, yeah.
[268:08.39]And I'm not showing that on my own stream.
[268:11.83]Laughing is healthy?
[268:13.17]Yeah, unless you have some kind of strange mystery medical condition.
[268:16.80]I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.
[268:23.08]But thank you, Necromancy Mage.
[268:28.78]Peter, thanks for the 300 bits.
[268:30.50]Cool guy.
[268:31.08]Thanks, Peter.
[268:31.52]Appreciate it.
[268:37.43]And then I remember the Ashanji $275 message that said, I've been trying to get Flaccid Lock trending.
[268:45.35]Phylactery Lich came in.
[268:46.49]My will be done.
[268:47.48]Another 250.
[268:47.96]Niall Orion, thanks for the 250.
[268:49.62]You guys gave too much money.
[268:51.26]Now Germans are going to retire.
[268:54.66]That's not going to happen.
[268:57.90]That just means that I'm gonna do more videos.
[269:00.46]Like, more streams.
[269:08.46]Let Faye choose now.
[269:10.10]What?
[269:13.10]Not videos, you know what I mean.
[269:14.22]Streams.
[269:16.12]Hey man, I just wanted to let you know that you were my gateway drug to watching pro wrestling.
[269:20.17]This is from Gleam for 250 bits.
[269:23.39]I always loved the rumbles and after re-watching them with my sister, Apple Shift, I decided to give real WWE a shot.
[269:29.51]I started watching Raw and immediately fell in love.
[269:32.49]It's so fucking fun.
[269:34.44]At first I thought that the fact that it was all scripted makes it stupid, but in reality it makes it even more fun.
[269:40.48]It's like theater with punching.
[269:42.32]Thank you so much for introducing this to me.
[269:45.44]Everyone's gonna call me a boomer, but you can watch all the old shit on YouTube, I think.
[269:55.15]All the Attitude Era stuff with Stone Cold, The Rock, The Undertaker, Kane.
[270:01.84]That, you want to watch that.
[270:03.60]Mankind getting thrown off the goddamn roof.
[270:07.68]They don't do shit like that anymore.
[270:10.72]Mankind got thrown off the roof of the cage.
[270:17.02]Actually, they really did it.
[270:19.42]And it almost fucking killed him.
[270:20.83]Yeah.
[270:24.27]It was unbelievable.
[270:25.89]That guy was... What's his name?
[270:29.05]I can't think of his name.
[270:30.53]Mick Foley.
[270:33.47]It was ridiculous.
[270:34.57]He just didn't give a shit.
[270:36.09]He just didn't give a fuck.
[270:39.07]That guy was just legendary at doing crazy shit in that ring.
[270:52.41]I think they've dialed it down in the last 10 years or so.
[270:59.15]But... I don't know.
[271:05.01]I've only seen a few things recently.
[271:12.33]There's a new wrestling thing in town, though, isn't there?
[271:16.30]That AEW?
[271:18.32]Isn't that the new...
[271:20.65]Hot thing right now is AEW is like really starting to get people to come over and it's better than the WWE.
[271:26.13]Because the WWE is like not as good anymore now.
[271:29.86]Speaking of WWE things that aren't good anymore.
[271:33.64]Can you believe they even released 2K20 WWE?
[271:43.26]I am so happy that we will probably never get a fucking WWE 2K game ever again.
[271:48.36]I hope not.
[271:49.57]Oh God, I pray every single day.
[271:54.15]Yuke's decided they were like, no, this is like boring and sucks and is wicked shitty every year.
[271:59.19]And they left.
[272:01.91]So please, everyone, put your hands together and pray that the thing that Yuke's comes up with is like it used to be back in like 2013, 2012.
[272:16.79]Am I gonna use 2k20 for the next Jerma Rumble?
[272:18.65]Probably not, because it's fucking terrible.
[272:22.83]I mean, like, bugs are funny, but when the game can't even function... If I spend, like, two weeks or, like, a full week making wrestlers in that game, and we can't get a Rumble to even work... I'm not even sure this is worth doing.
[272:46.00]And that shit's 60 bucks.
[272:49.33]Yuke isn't on the series anymore.
[272:50.47]No, because they went to do their own thing.
[272:54.83]They do make it funny, though.
[272:55.98]Maybe.
[272:56.36]I don't know.
[272:57.20]I'll check it out, but... I don't know.
[273:03.75]Do 2K14 again?
[273:04.89]I can't.
[273:06.69]I would.
[273:07.29]I just can't.
[273:08.12]It's on the PlayStation 3 and it's the last one that, it was the last 2K game that was on the PlayStation 3 and it just chugs.
[273:18.92]It doesn't, it really is not supposed to even be on there.
[273:22.85]It was the final one that they stuffed as much bullshit into.
[273:25.91]And it's just, it takes like 60 seconds to load hair in that goddamn game if you have too many layers on a character.
[273:41.12]I would, but it was too, it's too painful to try to put, to make a character anymore.
[273:51.17]It's the effort that is respected.
[273:54.65]Plus, I don't have any of the old wrestlers anymore.
[273:56.79]I mean, I made like 60 people in the old 2K14, 2K13 games.
[274:06.32]Can you get it on PS4?
[274:07.30]I wish.
[274:08.52]Unless it's emulated.
[274:09.44]But emulating a PS3, half of the games don't even work.
[274:16.32]More than that.
[274:16.82]More than half, actually, I think.
[274:21.50]I don't know.
[274:22.48]I'll see what I'm going to do.
[274:25.06]But I'm glad you got into wrestling.
[274:26.24]It's a really fun sport to watch.
[274:30.31]Dubsky Dude, thanks for the $2.50.
[274:31.37]Hey, Jerma, I heard you were having health problems recently, but I missed the last couple streams, so I've only gotten small bits of the story.
[274:38.19]According to chat, you took a bath and your skin turned yellow, and to treat it, your doctor prescribed weapons-grade gamer laxatives.
[274:44.17]Sounds really serious.
[274:46.09]I hope you're doing okay.
[274:52.23]You know what?
[274:52.55]I'm just gonna say yes.
[274:53.91]Yes.
[274:55.87]Thank you, Ratboy, for the 525.
[275:00.82]And Ratboy says nothing but this.
[275:05.48]Which is... Here's some Dunkly Donut.
[275:12.40]Because you're epic.
[275:14.21]What is this?
[275:19.08]Hold on.
[275:20.88]This is the fucking dumbest thing I've ever seen.
[275:28.38]Why do people make these?
[275:45.14]Here's some dunk... Is there a way of screaming that?
[275:56.93]Fuck.
[275:58.25]Thank you, rat boy.
[275:59.25]Appreciate it.
[276:00.35]And then finally, from four days ago, it was the ball of koala to end it with 550 bits.
[276:04.67]Hey, Jerma, glad you're feeling well enough to do a full nine plus hours.
[276:08.68]Can't put into words how much your streams mean to me.
[276:10.90]Haven't had many people to talk to since I came home from uni.
[276:13.72]And you and your community keep me on the up and up while I make friends at work.
[276:18.06]Fuck yeah.
[276:18.81]I'm really glad to hear that.
[276:20.29]Don't usually do donos this personal, but you and everyone here is awesome.
[276:27.92]Thank you so much, Balla Koala.
[276:33.48]I hope you're hanging out in the Discord.
[276:36.46]It's a great place to be.
[276:39.24]And that is the bits that we missed from four days ago.
[276:47.28]Thank you, everybody that contributed.
[276:50.20]There were $3,041 of bits.
[276:57.08]1,294 gifted subs, and 347 regular subscriptions.
[277:04.64]Four days ago.
[277:07.62]That is the most outrageous number I've ever seen.
[277:10.76]I cannot fucking believe that.
[277:20.18]Thank you, guys.
[277:23.15]And now, we are gonna do
[277:26.16]Today.
[277:28.97]This shouldn't take us that long.
[277:31.01]So, don't just strap in too much, too far.
[277:34.53]How long has it been?
[277:35.13]Like, 45 minutes?
[277:36.17]I told you this wasn't going to be that bad.

[279:51.04]I need to download this for Kim.
[279:59.45]This is for Kim.
[280:04.19]Isn't that fucking crazy though?
[280:05.61]That is awesome.
[280:10.20]Look at Kim.
[280:11.82]Kim's is like, it's as if you just took a picture of her.
[280:19.01]Kim, are you watching the stream right now?
[280:42.15]That's fucking awesome.

[280:51.44]Thanks for- Snowflakes, thanks for the 250 bits, and like the- the $7000 images.
[281:02.84]Thank you.
[281:05.96]Put it on the fridge?
[281:07.48]Maybe?
[281:11.36]Killer Crocomire gave 5,000 bits and I didn't see it.
[281:14.78]They say long time no bits.
[281:15.92]Thanks for the 50 fucking bucks.
[281:18.16]Leave the title screen on for an extended song.
[281:20.52]It's amazing and should share it with everyone.
[281:22.20]Also, WWE 2K20 is now available and dear God, does it suck.
[281:26.42]Talking about Parappa.
[281:28.96]Yeah, I heard it's not good.
[281:32.79]Yep.
[281:34.85]It's sad.
[281:37.41]Sad that after 2K14...
[281:40.61]2K was like, you know, let's turn this into a Madden.
[281:46.87]You guys, Madden's fun, isn't it?
[281:49.49]Sure.
[281:51.06]Who's on the teams this year?
[281:52.42]I don't know.
[281:56.54]Update them.
[281:58.90]Who's on the Patriots?
[282:00.62]We added a couple new people.
[282:03.61]Cool.
[282:09.52]That just made me really sad.
[282:11.12]Um... I am really sad about that now.
[282:17.14]Well, anyways.
[282:18.64]Killer Crocomire, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[282:20.44]It's a huge amount of money, especially after fucking four days ago.
[282:26.22]Thanks a lot.
[282:28.06]Dragon Brett, thanks for the 250.
[282:29.46]I had a dream of you last night.
[282:30.80]You were at my house just hanging out outside.
[282:33.01]So I went outside to talk with you.
[282:34.89]You wanted to do your chase-me joke from Duck Game and ran off.
[282:39.54]So I was chasing you when Joel called me and was wondering where the fuck you went.
[282:44.32]You heard me explaining to Joel what you were doing and you realized how stupid the situation was and started laughing hysterically.
[282:51.37]You sat on the ground and laughed, but I thought you were crying so I awkwardly walked away.
[282:57.13]I am insane in everybody's dreams.
[282:59.82]Why can't anybody have a dream that I'm in where I'm just at a restaurant just sitting there eating and enjoying dinner?
[283:07.26]And like something else fucking crazy happens, and I go, whoa, that was insane.
[283:10.42]Dude, did you see that?
[283:12.20]Why am I always the weirdo?
[283:15.18]I always have to be the monster in your dreams.
[283:25.98]Hey, Vin Vertigo, thanks for the 500 bits.
[283:27.78]Jeremy, you're the best.
[283:28.82]I've been watching your videos for a long time now, but only recently started using Twitch this year.
[283:32.38]Welcome to Twitch.
[283:35.41]It's a fun place.
[283:37.07]Interesting place.
[283:39.43]Thank you, Nut, for the 500 bits.
[283:41.49]Hey, Jerma, I'm driving right now.
[283:42.92]What do you mean, driving right now?
[283:50.40]Like, you're in a car and somebody's driving.
[283:54.96]Or you're driving the car right now and saying that.
[283:59.70]Let me be like, I mean, this was a while ago, but get off your fucking phone.
[284:04.91]Don't do that shit.
[284:17.49]Is he gonna give him the dad talk?
[284:18.69]No, I'm gonna give him the fucking real talk.
[284:23.69]Put your phones down.
[284:26.45]Put them down.
[284:29.79]Your attention should be on the road.
[284:33.28]Not on Snapchat.
[284:35.12]Your attention should be on the road.
[284:37.52]Not on the funny thing that was in the group chat today.
[284:42.24]You want to call this a dad talk, I call this a fucking human talk.
[284:51.57]I really hope that's a joke, because that's, don't, don't fucking, don't fucking run.
[284:55.23]Seriously, don't fucking run.
[285:01.00]Jerma, if you want to lecture me, you're gonna have to adopt me.
[285:03.23]No, I'm just, I'm saying, like, come on.
[285:10.63]You gotta be careful, and you can't just... Remember, this is, I think a lot of people just forget this shit.
[285:17.94]For some reason.
[285:19.54]When you are driving, you are in a, like, three, two or three thousand pound death machine.
[285:28.27]You are just, and you are going 30, 40, 50, 60 miles per hour in a 3,000 pound weight.
[285:43.83]Cars are actually terrifying.
[285:46.53]You gotta be fucking careful.
[285:55.05]Please do this for all the people donating, saying this is their savings or they don't have enough money.
[286:01.39]What do you mean?
[286:08.37]He hates cars.
[286:11.33]Talking about donators that say they don't have any money and they donate.
[286:15.96]Oh, I see what you mean.
[286:17.36]I think I've made it pretty clear before.
[286:21.54]But I'll do it again, just in case anyone has not heard it yet.
[286:25.51]you need to take care of yourself first and I am not a priority for you take care of yourself first make sure you're doing alright your life is going fine financially if you want to give me money I will absolutely take it you know like I'm not going to be like no don't but please please please make sure you're taking care of yourself first I am not a priority for you
[286:57.89]I'm a broke-ass student, and check it out, no sub.
[287:00.41]And you don't ever have to sub.
[287:03.11]You never have to do that.
[287:05.41]If you, let me tell you, the orange bread, if you never sub to this channel, ever, and you never give even a cent to this channel, it's alright, that's fine.
[287:17.00]That's, oh, are you having, do you, are you having fun?
[287:19.86]Do you like watching the streams?
[287:21.84]Do you have fun here?
[287:23.50]Good.
[287:26.04]Fuck it.
[287:26.34]You don't have to give this channel money.
[287:37.31]I think people understand that.
[287:38.51]I hope they really do.
[287:46.25]I'm not having fun.
[287:47.04]You said you hate cars and that's my favorite movie.
[287:53.08]I like that one.
[287:56.38]Does it make us a monster if we never sub?
[287:59.06]Why would I ever think that?
[288:06.46]Why would I ever be like, well, you know, I mean, you should sub.
[288:13.74]No.
[288:15.08]If you can't afford it, if you can't afford to pay this stream money, then don't.
[288:20.06]Just don't.
[288:23.86]you still contribute to this stream even though if you don't think so like think about it let's say I mean the streams have been the last three or four months or so I mean there's been a lot of people here and even if you're not paying money to the stream you're still contributing to the success of this stream
[288:49.81]Does that make sense?
[288:51.59]So don't ever think.
[288:53.17]Somebody gifted you a sub.
[288:59.64]Alright.
[288:59.84]Somebody gifted him a sub.
[289:01.82]Cool.
[289:02.36]Thank you.
[289:02.82]I guess.
[289:03.26]Cool.
[289:09.97]But anyways, long story short, get off your fucking phone when you're driving a car.
[289:15.07]Don't do that.
[289:17.15]And if you don't have the money to pay this stream, save it.
[289:21.67]Take care of yourself first.
[289:23.79]Take care of me somewhere like down the bottom.
[289:26.49]Like, you know, if you have still cash lying around, you're like, you know what, fine.
[289:29.63]Fuck it.
[289:31.62]Take care of yourself first.
[289:32.72]Always.
[289:35.04]Back to the moral of the story.
[289:39.94]but we also we had a ton of community subs this stream too a ton of them I it happened again for like about 10 straight minutes 15 straight minutes and I remember because I missed numb legs given a hundred dollars and they asked if this is going to get my attention and it didn't Jesus
[290:04.52]Thank you, Gnarly, for the $2.50.
[290:05.40]Thank you for the thank you.
[290:07.18]I probably won't be able to gift sub anymore, but just know that you are worth every penny.
[290:10.83]Also, the URL of the clip of you thanking me ends in PogChamp, which is a sign from the heavens, I think.
[290:17.05]It actually is.
[290:20.05]It actually is PogChamp.
[290:22.55]Gnarly, thanks for the nine community subs.
[290:27.18]Thank you, appreciate that.
[290:28.12]Thanks for the money.
[290:33.03]Nice work.
[290:47.15]I look so fucking deranged on camera.
[290:50.35]Jerma, more face cam.
[290:51.35]And then I watch a clip and I look at my eyes and I go, that person's deranged.
[290:57.95]But thank you, Gnarly.
[290:58.81]And yeah, PogChamp.
[291:02.49]Boneless Bacon, thanks for the thousand bits.
[291:04.45]Thank you, Boneless Bacon.
[291:05.25]Remember, this isn't me giving you bits.
[291:06.79]This is you owing me bits.
[291:08.61]You owe me $10.
[291:09.59]Also, you still smell.
[291:10.55]Go shower.
[291:12.61]Well, I can't give it back to you, so... It's mine.
[291:15.17]Forever.
[291:17.33]I want to give a very special thank you to Bobboy.
[291:21.30]They had a bunch of community subs today.
[291:25.50]Thank you, Bobboy.
[291:26.16]Greedy.
[291:28.24]Greedy.
[291:32.00]Moss Lion, thanks for the $250.
[291:33.28]Just wanted to let you know that your hair is very lush and full for your age.
[291:36.22]And, like, really, anything that chat says about your hair is invalid.
[291:40.08]I know.
[291:42.10]I know.
[291:44.81]We know.
[291:45.61]You and I know.
[291:46.25]You and I get it.
[291:50.23]And then, Vilemi... Oh, my goodness.
[291:52.09]I... Vilemi gave... This is from earlier.
[291:57.26]I remember this is $5.
[291:57.84]$550. $550.
[292:03.34]55,000 bits.
[292:05.67]That happened like two or three hours ago.
[292:08.73]We touched it.
[292:09.13]We already went over it.
[292:12.07]But man.
[292:14.78]That is... That's... Okay.
[292:21.62]When you start to cross that threshold of like in one bit donation, it's more than a fucking video game console.
[292:32.27]It's just like, holy shit, man.
[292:37.08]Thank you so much, Valimi.
[292:39.00]I really, really, really appreciate it.
[292:48.87]Jerma is actually a hot, successful person who would be a steamboat to be around.
[292:53.59]Just imagine this strong guy walking around the Vegas strip in his aviators and tight button up being like, I got money for that.
[293:00.01]I'm self-employed.
[293:03.37]What?
[293:05.19]Why am I reading?
[293:05.82]I don't know.
[293:06.26]I don't know.
[293:07.28]It was a paragraph.
[293:08.56]It was a paragraph and just put a fish on it.
[293:10.24]It doesn't matter.
[293:10.68]Put a paragraph or a fish and I'll read it.
[293:13.68]I don't know.
[293:14.24]I don't know why I read that.
[293:15.22]It just happens.
[293:16.00]I don't know why.
[293:19.41]Because they called me strong and, like, cool and funny.
[293:23.01]And I read it.
[293:25.98]But, Vilemi, thank you for the 55 fucking hundred.
[293:31.38]55,000 bits.
[293:33.72]My god.
[293:35.34]He's an egomaniac.
[293:37.73]Jerma is so weird and annoying.
[293:42.01]I'm sorry.
[293:44.24]Clueless Sniper, thanks for the 500 bits.
[293:45.70]Wait, is this streamer playing The Thing?
[293:47.22]This is my entire life-saving, Jerma.
[293:49.10]Please take it.
[293:52.82]Is this a play on what was... Thank you.
[293:58.64]Numblegs, thanks for the $50.
[294:00.63]Jerma, please read the big bits.
[294:03.95]Doing it now.
[294:05.93]Doing it now, doing it now, doing it now, doing it now.
[294:08.41]Shoot him with an arrow.
[294:09.95]What the fuck are you talking about?
[294:15.48]Thank you, Numblegs, for your hundreds of dollars.
[294:19.28]150.
[294:19.60]At least today.
[294:22.84]Thanks a lot.
[294:24.40]Huge bits.
[294:26.82]And then Vilemi gave 300 bits.
[294:33.07]After the ridiculous $550 drop.
[294:39.07]Really, though, thank you, Jeremy.
[294:40.17]Even without the awoo, being able to come home after a long day and watch my favorite streamer makes everything more bearable.
[294:49.64]Thank you, Vilemi.
[294:51.42]Take care of yourself.
[294:53.84]Take care of yourself because you're taking care of me.
[294:57.04]Big time.
[294:57.74]So, take care of yourself.
[295:00.58]I really appreciate it.
[295:03.04]I'm glad you can have fun.
[295:05.12]It was Awu.
[295:05.88]No, no, no.
[295:08.23]A-W-0-0-0.
[295:09.77]Not the other one.
[295:15.67]Thanks a lot, Vilemi.

[295:28.83]You can do it, Jermbo.
[295:29.71]You just gotta believe.
[295:31.97]Oh, this is when I was going nuts.
[295:34.55]Yeah, I was going like fucking crazy here.
[295:40.50]Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.
[295:41.69]I was being a weirdo.
[295:43.59]Uh, thank you, LilDinosaur.

[295:46.95]LilDino- LilDinosaur.
[295:48.99]My god.

[296:04.80]Tomorrow's my birthday.
[296:06.08]If you could give a shout out to my boyfriend who got me into watching you, that would be great.
[296:09.42]His name is Hunter and we love and appreciate you.
[296:12.10]Thanks for being so amazing.
[296:13.98]Hey.
[296:16.42]Hey, first of all, happy birthday.
[296:20.36]Happy birthday to you.
[296:22.39]And now I got something to say to you.

[296:28.07]Hunter?
[296:30.25]You introduced... Jillian?
[296:36.50]Or... Whoever it is?
[296:41.90]Li- Lilden?
[296:43.39]Lilden?
[296:45.35]I saw Lilden!
[296:47.15]And I'm saying J- Okay, Lilden.
[296:49.79]Let me tell- Okay, Hunter.
[296:53.81]Not Illidan.
[296:55.29]J-

[296:59.66]No, not, okay, it's LilDinosaur.
[297:03.00]Not Lildan, not Jillian, not Jillidan.
[297:07.71]Hunter, you and I gotta talk.
[297:10.71]First of all, shout out to you for introducing Lildan to my stream and my videos.
[297:19.91]You two are fucking awesome.
[297:21.37]I've heard you two are the best.
[297:23.61]I'm doing a cameo right now.

[297:53.36]You're a viewer.
[297:54.58]You guys watch.
[297:55.74]Thank you for being so amazing.
[297:57.18]Thank you for watching.
[297:59.84]Father, can we talk about cameos for a minute here?
[298:03.48]Do people do cameos and they make the like celebrity talk about their products?
[298:09.31]Like, I swear to God, I think I've seen like sub shops.
[298:13.24]Like, local, like, Philadelphia sub shops that have, like, Mr. Wonderful talk about their sub shop.
[298:20.08]What, do they just put it up on a fucking screen up above the door?
[298:22.43]Hey, everybody, Mr. Wonderful here.
[298:24.69]Just want to tell you about the best sub I've ever had.
[298:26.93]Best.
[298:27.81]Absolutely delicious.
[298:28.81]From the Berry Subs in Philadelphia.
[298:32.05]I came in and they took care of me.
[298:36.79]I'm telling you.
[298:46.29]No, I'm telling you.
[298:48.47]People get people to say stuff about their local businesses.
[298:51.85]They do testimonials with... I wouldn't do that.
[298:56.84]If I got a cameo and it was like... Well, hold on a minute here.
[299:00.50]Also, some of those cameos are like a thousand dollars.
[299:04.81]But I would never do a cameo because I don't know... I don't want to just be like the Fiverr guy.
[299:12.37]Hey guys, Jerma985 here.
[299:14.31]And let me tell you, I am so excited for Steve's Laundromat.
[299:23.47]They have the best, freshest ingredients.
[299:26.47]They have the most wonderful staff.
[299:29.95]And if you like dogs, they've got a dog too there.
[299:34.13]I couldn't do it.
[299:38.07]Okay, if it was, like, anniversaries and stuff, right?
[299:40.03]Like, I would have a strict policy where, like, anniversaries, birthdays, uh, shoutouts.
[299:46.88]But if, like, the name of your product, I'm not gonna sell your, like, multi-level marketing fucking makeup or something.
[299:54.62]Hey, everybody, Jerma985 here for, uh, for, uh, what's the popular one?
[300:01.54]What's the popular one?
[300:03.16]What's the popular one?
[300:03.74]What's the popular one?
[300:07.86]What's the popular one?
[300:10.04]Actually, no, I'm not going to say it.
[300:12.88]I'm not going to say it.
[300:13.46]Because what a fucking reverse IQ play that is.
[300:17.97]No, I'm not going to sell your multi-level marketing campaign.
[300:21.17]I'm not going to fucking shout out your sandwich shop.
[300:26.43]But anyways, Hunter.
[300:27.83]I'm talking to you.
[300:29.35]No, seriously.
[300:30.01]Thanks, both of you.
[300:35.91]I really appreciate it.
[300:36.55]I'm glad that you guys can enjoy the streams and content.
[300:38.63]Thank you.
[300:42.03]Hey, Errorless gave $2.50, $2.50, $2.50.
[300:45.69]And they say, sorry, I just love that video clip of Otto.
[300:49.50]I'm not clicking this link.
[300:52.88]I don't know what this link is.
[300:54.30]I'm glad you think Otto is cute.
[300:55.60]Thank you so much for the $7.50.
[300:57.44]But this is a link I've never seen before.
[301:01.39]I don't know what this website is.
[301:04.15]P-Pack Vim?
[301:06.65]What is that?
[301:07.03]Is it like a porno thing?
[301:08.55]I don't know what this is.
[301:17.39]It's malware.
[301:18.71]Virus.
[301:20.81]What if I happen to just have something like YouTube?
[301:27.49]P-Pack?
[301:28.03]No.
[301:29.37]Just click it.
[301:29.85]I'm not clicking it.
[301:31.71]I can't click it.
[301:32.51]No.
[301:32.71]And I don't want to give it to you guys either because I don't want you to click it.
[301:35.25]It's a clip of auto?
[301:35.99]Alright, let me click it.
[301:43.60]Alright.
[301:43.98]Clip of auto.
[301:44.72]That is really cute.
[301:46.96]Let's see.
[301:50.08]Oh, that is funny.
[301:53.16]That's cute.
[301:59.12]He's barking at the mailman.
[302:01.32]What the fuck?
[302:06.14]I remember that.
[302:06.89]That's true.
[302:09.77]The mailman puts the mail in.
[302:15.91]Yep.
[302:19.07]That was so fucking cute.
[302:21.31]I love my dog.
[302:24.76]Show us.
[302:26.40]Oh, I can't.
[302:28.46]Where is it?
[302:29.75]Where's that link?
[302:30.37]I can't find that link.
[302:37.67]Thank you, Mr. ADHD, for the 5, 10, 15, 100 bits.
[302:44.18]Wipe your forehead.
[302:46.74]Don't wipe your forehead.
[302:47.42]I'm kidding.
[302:47.72]You look fine.
[302:48.28]Anyway, how's your day?

[303:08.46]And they said, Jerma, don't die.
[303:10.94]Don't worry, I'm gonna be fine.
[303:12.40]Don't worry, thank you for the thousand fucking dollars.
[303:17.04]And that's not me making that up.
[303:18.68]That's actually $1,100 over the last week.
[303:22.21]So, yeah.
[303:25.71]Porn in chat.
[303:27.61]Get that fucking porn out of here.
[303:29.63]Hey, let me tell you something.
[303:32.23]There was one time where somebody linked porn like twice.
[303:35.38]You guys have been really good.
[303:38.20]And I do not want to delete this privilege from you guys.
[303:47.47]Don't, don't do it.
[303:50.14]Do not do it.
[303:52.42]And that was the same person that did it like three times.

[303:56.12]Are you here?
[303:56.62]Do you like, are you here?

[304:03.80]Does anyone remember this?
[304:05.04]It happened like three times from the same person.
[304:08.76]And we gave the benefit of the doubt like twice.
[304:10.86]I remember this.

[304:56.27]I appreciate it.
[304:57.49]And it's available now.
[304:59.65]We'll see.
[305:00.37]Maybe it'll be there.
[305:03.59]And now it's time for the credits.

[305:36.40]Look at all these subs.
[305:40.90]Lots and lots of subs.
[305:43.06]But thank you, Labster.
[305:45.26]That will probably become an emote.
[305:46.62]But should it, though?
[305:47.98]I feel like if it becomes an emote, then it might lose its magic as being the funniest picture I've ever seen.
[305:56.46]That's a tough one.
[305:59.52]Flugboy, thanks for the $250.
[306:00.70]Having kind of a weird night.
[306:01.70]Hope you're doing well, Jeremy.
[306:02.70]Was happy to have you as a pick-me-up when I got home.
[306:06.92]Thanks, Flugboy.
[306:09.00]Glad to be here.
[306:11.28]Hope your night gets better.
[306:16.39]Thank you Snooze and Cofter for the $2.50.
[306:17.68]Are these the subs for today?
[306:20.16]Yep.
[306:20.86]This is just today.
[306:25.92]I actually had a dream once where I met you.
[306:27.76]That was before I went to PAX and actually met you.
[306:30.47]And we played Mario Kart together.
[306:32.43]Alright.
[306:33.09]Cool.
[306:34.29]Fairly fucking normal.
[306:36.09]Now, when do I eat the controller and like shit on your bed?
[306:39.31]Let's find out.
[306:41.35]After that, you modded me in Twitch and I thought, holy shit, that's awesome.
[306:44.64]And then I woke up and was actually a little bummed out.
[306:47.46]Because with the first few seconds, I thought it was real.
[306:49.66]Next time we will meet, I'll bring Mario Kart for real.
[306:52.48]Also, can we please listen to this Parappa remix?
[306:57.54]That's pog moment right there.
[306:59.52]I didn't shit on your bed.
[307:01.83]Alright, what's this remix?
[307:11.53]Thank you, Snooze and Copter.
[307:14.27]Literally dreams are the worst.
[307:17.71]Don't bring up old fucking videos.
[307:20.96]This is the romantic love remix.
[307:27.56]We'll have this play itself.
[307:31.18]This is pretty good.
[307:35.75]Hey, Colusia, thanks for the 250.
[307:37.77]Hey, Jerma, that one bit message just reminded me of my own Jerma dream I had a few weeks ago.
[307:41.37]Okay, hold on.
[307:47.54]Here comes the... I, like, blow a snot rocket into your eye and then, like, burn down your house.
[307:53.84]Here we go.
[307:55.37]Dude, do you...
[308:23.27]Really fucking weird, shitty, dumb content seems to increase viewers on Twitch, not decrease them.
[308:36.20]I sat here with a vacuum cleaner going for five straight minutes with no other sounds, and I full screen cammed my face sitting there with no emotion, and the stream went up by like four or five hundred viewers.
[308:54.82]Maybe it was boring.
[308:55.72]People don't... People like bad, but they don't like boring.
[309:03.54]You know what's here?
[309:04.66]You know what?
[309:06.58]Being boring might be worse than being bad.
[309:11.15]In an entertainment sense.
[309:14.55]Damn, that is true.
[309:18.07]Wow.
[309:19.95]Holy shit.
[309:22.43]That's some next level... Think about that.
[309:25.97]Huh.
[309:27.13]Who said that?
[309:28.40]Who said that?
[309:28.96]Modem.
[309:30.32]And then unmodem.
[309:35.10]Did it.
[309:40.84]But thank you, Colusia, for the 250.
[309:44.34]Keith King Crimson, thanks for the $2.50.
[309:46.34]Hey, Jerma, I visited Steve's laundromat at your suggestion.
[309:49.92]The ingredients weren't fresh at all, and the owners were huge dickheads about it.
[309:53.33]Also, the dog tried to bite me.
[309:54.67]What the fuck?
[309:55.93]Yeah, that's why I don't do shoutouts for businesses or for, like, that's why I don't do that.
[310:03.79]Finally, at the very end, we had Godot.
[310:06.40]Thanks, Godot, for the $2.50.
[310:07.30]Hey, Jerma, just had a weird dream with you in it.
[310:09.64]Okay, here it comes.
[310:11.88]I know it's gonna happen.
[310:14.98]When do I, like, light a fart and, like, the flames from the fart, like, break your TV?
[310:22.42]Here we go.
[310:23.48]Hey, Jerma, I just had the weird dream about you.
[310:24.95]I was looking for a good restaurant on the Strip when I saw you.
[310:27.57]Okay.
[310:28.75]I went up to say hi, but you suddenly looked at me with hate in your eyes and snapped your fingers.
[310:33.73]Immediately, your six bodyguards grabbed me and threw me off the Strip and into the Mojave Desert at 12 p.m.
[310:39.63]Pacific time.
[310:41.01]Anyways, when are you going to pay back those people for starting the money train you planned?
[310:45.39]what threw me off the strip into the at 12 p.m pacific time I don't understand you skipped my bits I didn't skip bits it's 250 bits to be read at the end of the stream
[311:09.63]We've talked about this.
[311:10.73]We've already gone over this many times.
[311:14.18]I've got many, many times.
[311:18.14]I've talked about it.
[311:19.46]People just don't listen.
[311:21.40]They don't want to listen to me.
[311:26.47]Trump, Trump, go away.
[311:42.32]People.
[311:44.38]Listen.
[311:45.42]Shh.

[311:56.47]And she was talking and we were seeing all the, what did he say?
[312:01.87]And then she was just talking.
[312:05.02]He does that sometimes.
[312:14.82]Let me try again.
[312:15.54]One more.
[312:19.07]Okay, it's me doing the Donald Trump, Stephen Colbert Trump.
[312:24.81]Oh, I can't believe it.

[313:50.49]He zoned out.
[313:51.01]Yeah, I did.
[313:52.97]Alice's Restaurant is 20 minutes long.
[313:54.59]This is an 18 minute song.
[314:02.65]Okay, cool.
[314:05.80]My VOD's gonna get muted instantly.
[314:08.80]Did I just get fucking ruined?
[314:11.72]Okay, I was gonna do... Okay, one more try.
[314:13.78]No.

[314:20.46]Yubari, thanks for the 500 bits.
[314:21.38]Hey, Jerma, I had an odd dream with you.
[314:22.94]Basically, if you're reading this, Jerma, you've been in a coma for almost 24 days now.
[314:26.16]We're trying a new technique.
[314:27.01]We don't know where this message will end up in your dream, but we hope it works.
[314:30.25]Please wake up.
[314:30.87]We miss you.
[314:31.39]That's a classic.
[314:32.81]Ishanji, thanks for the 275 bits.
[314:34.95]I had a dream where you played the thing and you convinced me to give you my life savings.
[314:38.07]Weird, huh?
