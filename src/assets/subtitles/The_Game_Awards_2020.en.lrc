[ve:60.16.100]

[00:22.19]Oh, hi, didn't see you there.
[00:23.31]Yeah, I did actually.
[00:25.27]How you doing?
[00:25.71]I'm doing okay.
[00:30.67]Or should I sit here?
[00:32.58]Or sit here?
[00:33.34]Like this?
[00:33.62]So you can get like a full-on like face reaction of my fucking day.
[00:37.40]Look at all the cool stuff at Game Awards.
[00:41.20]Why is there no stream?
[00:43.15]I don't understand.
[00:49.31]Don't they usually have like a big thing, like 25 advertisements before every one of these?
[00:53.11]I missed it?
[00:56.71]What do you mean I missed it?
[00:58.73]No, it says live December 10th.
[01:00.57]I didn't miss it.
[01:03.28]Hold on, I gotta tweet this.
[01:07.52]I missed the stream.
[01:09.74]That would be embarrassing.
[01:14.40]It was yesterday.
[01:18.32]We got a bunch of comedians in here.
[01:23.74]But what is today?
[01:24.34]What is actually today?
[01:32.45]Actually refresh though.
[01:33.35]Alright, hold on.
[01:34.03]Hold on.
[01:34.99]Why is this so... This doesn't make any sense.
[01:36.39]Why does it look like this?
[01:41.61]Oh, okay.
[01:41.84]There we go.
[01:42.94]Okay, so... Hold on.
[01:43.94]Do I have to follow the... Refresh the page?
[01:45.50]Is it going?
[01:46.96]Is it going?
[01:51.94]It's not even going.
[01:58.31]What's this?
[02:00.97]Jeff Q&A.
[02:02.51]Riot Games.
[02:03.43]Chat Choice Awards.
[02:05.35]Game Awards.
[02:05.95]No, where's the actual live stream?
[02:11.41]Why didn't you shave?
[02:12.11]I don't know.
[02:14.55]Click that one.
[02:15.73]Can I stream that one?
[02:16.81]What's the rules here?
[02:20.56]What are the actual rules?
[02:24.46]This is why I only wanted to get here 15 minutes early.
[02:26.90]My pre-show.
[02:27.88]You think I have anything for my pre-show?
[02:30.23]No.
[02:30.99]I played like three games that have been nominated this year.
[02:33.41]And one of them I played for like an hour.
[02:36.57]You don't want to be here for me.
[02:40.30]I have a terrible sense of what is cool this year.
[02:43.46]I took like three months off.
[02:45.48]I played like 12 video games.
[02:47.70]Spit just flew out of my mouth.
[02:48.96]That's how you can tell I'm really rabid tonight.
[02:57.35]What can I watch?
[03:00.33]Sing the pre-show song.
[03:04.61]Hot Chalky?
[03:05.45]Oh, man, it's hot.
[03:06.59]No, it's not.
[03:08.45]Oh, look at my gross mouth spots.
[03:11.55]Ugh.
[03:15.13]Can you see this?
[03:18.21]How am I drinking this coffee?
[03:23.62]Am I going like... Look at this, there's a bunch of mouth spots and water.
[03:29.22]There's lipstick on here.
[03:39.29]I think there's actually lipstick on this cup.
[03:52.76]Can you see the, like, lipstick mark?
[04:04.57]Ew, ew, ew.
[04:05.85]Evil lighting, too?
[04:07.15]I didn't show any nudes on stream, alright?
[04:12.55]Everybody relax.
[04:13.53]What time is it?
[04:16.82]324?
[04:16.84]When does this thing start?
[04:23.07]Okay, so let's think let's think about your handsome Not anymore yeah, but on no no what's my good side I
[04:48.81]Let's find this out.
[04:49.35]I don't know who gives a shit about the Game Awards.
[04:50.75]Let's talk about my- me and how, like, got my appearance.
[04:53.84]What's my good side, you guys think?
[04:56.20]I don't.
[04:56.44]Okay, so this is me.
[05:04.80]What's, like, the good side?
[05:11.34]Both?
[05:12.54]What's worse?
[05:13.96]I think this side's probably the bad side.
[05:15.32]If I were to take a- If it would be me in the mirror.
[05:18.70]Alright, I gotta talk about, like, video games.
[05:20.20]This is getting weird.
[05:20.92]This is like, I'm like a weird guy that's, like, obsessed with himself.
[05:23.80]You know, with, like, good sides over here.
[05:25.52]But I don't know about this one.
[05:26.26]I think this looks okay this way, too.
[05:28.54]Like, it's the fucking Game Awards tonight.
[05:31.98]What did I play this year?
[05:32.94]Alright, I'm gonna do a pre-show.
[05:35.40]What did I play this year?
[05:39.26]I came out this year.
[05:40.12]Put your head on the statue.
[05:45.22]I don't know, this feels weird.
[05:48.97]I played Doodle God.
[05:50.17]Hades, yes.
[05:51.01]Alright, if I want Hades to win something, I really do.
[05:55.63]Hades came out this year.
[05:58.89]Um... Mug Snacks.
[06:01.49]What else did I play?
[06:03.89]Watch Dogs.
[06:04.61]Watch Dogs is not going to get nominated for anything.
[06:06.68]And if it does... Like, if Watch Dogs is on there for Game of the Year, I haven't even looked.
[06:10.00]I don't even care.
[06:12.36]Half-Life Alyx, but that didn't come out this year, did it?
[06:16.20]Did Half-Life Alyx come out in 2020?
[06:20.41]Athlite Velox came out in 2020?
[06:23.49]Oh, shit.
[06:24.31]Alright.
[06:24.55]Why is that?
[06:25.19]That was probably the game of the year.
[06:27.13]Is that not on game of the year?
[06:30.74]I would say that would be game of the year for me.
[06:34.82]It's not even on the list.
[06:39.16]Why the fuck would that not be on the list?
[06:42.60]How is that?
[06:44.79]It's a snub.
[06:46.25]Because nobody has VR?
[06:48.40]It's because like only like 2% of people have VR?
[06:50.44]That's kind of weird.
[06:58.66]But it's like, it's probably the best game that I played this year.
[07:01.30]So why wouldn't it, you know, are we judging it based on the merits of how good a game was?
[07:05.20]Or are we judging it based on how many like Twitter followers the social media account has?
[07:10.99]Like how many Twitter followers does like the fucking Ubisoft Watch Dogs account have?
[07:18.20]How many active Reddit users are inside?
[07:20.06]Yeah.
[07:20.22]I mean, how many active Reddit users are like voting?
[07:25.37]But that doesn't make any sense because Half- Alyx is like a huge Reddit game.
[07:28.63]What are you talking about?
[07:29.29]Everybody loves that game.
[07:33.35]If that's the barometer, it's not right then.
[07:35.07]It's not accurate.
[07:38.95]It's a popularity contest, Jerma.
[07:41.73]The Valve is wicked popular.
[07:46.07]Top the stream.
[07:46.75]What time is it? 3.28.
[07:49.09]What else we got?
[07:49.61]Alright, so Half-Life Alyx is probably my game of the year.
[07:52.47]I would say.
[07:53.49]Hold on, let me get a couple more clanks in there so you can really tell I'm sitting down having a coffee with you.
[07:58.49]I think, um... No, that's ASMR shit.
[07:59.93]I'm not going to do that.
[08:01.28]I'll leave that be.
[08:03.30]Hades was good, too.
[08:04.34]I'd say Hades.
[08:05.68]No villain hair?
[08:06.40]No, I did!
[08:07.06]I put... My hair recently has been really wavy.
[08:11.02]I tried.
[08:13.10]I put a bunch of water in it and I've really tried to get it to go back, but it's too short, so it won't stay back.
[08:25.98]It won't stay back.
[08:27.74]It's gonna be like this.
[08:30.11]Wait, it hasn't even started.
[08:31.35]The Game Awards haven't even started yet.
[08:32.41]I got time.
[08:32.83]Should I just go throw water in my hair and get ready?
[08:37.15]I gotta get ready for the Game Awards, man.
[08:38.69]I gotta like slick my hair back.
[08:45.32]Do it on camera?
[08:45.96]I don't have a sink in here.
[08:48.84]Where do you see a sink?
[08:52.03]Dunk your head in water and come back here like Alright, I'm ready.
[08:55.55]I'm gonna look like sweaty.

[12:13.65]By the way, 5G, that's never going to roll out everywhere.
[12:16.21]You'll be able to do 5G in like five places.
[12:19.05]That's why it's called 5G.
[12:19.85]It's going to be in like five major cities in like a 200-yard radius.
[12:23.80]The following program may contain content that some viewers might find offensive.
[12:28.12]Oh, shit.
[12:29.81]Can you hear it?
[12:30.19]Are we good?
[12:31.25]Are we live?
[12:35.64]What's up, everyone?
[12:36.80]Sydney Goodman here, coming to you live from Los Angeles, California.

[12:42.48]Damn it!
[12:43.24]And please allow me to be the first to thank you for setting down Cyberpunk for a few hours.
[12:48.55]As you can probably tell, the Game Awards are going to look a little different this year.
[12:53.03]Our venue may be smaller, but the show itself is as gigantic as ever.
[12:58.05]The awards and world premieres won't be changing, except I guess the only people clapping will be me and probably a few crew members.
[13:05.08]Going remote this year will bring us musical performances from London and Tokyo.
[13:09.98]And one positive of tonight's mostly digital gathering is we'll get to see more faces in the talented teams behind this year's outstanding games.
[13:20.12]As for us, here in the pre-show, we'll be stuck in the remaining minutes before the Game Awards kick off with brand new trailers, mercifully brief integrated marketing, and Lynn will be performing a song from Persona 5 Strikers.
[13:34.37]And best of all, the big reason we're all here, awards.
[13:38.96]Our first category tonight is Best Score in Music.
[13:42.10]I'm just going right into it.
[13:42.86]It's a particularly strong contest this year with five standout nominees that could, on their own, represent the best of the generation.
[13:50.99]Here are the nominees for Best Score in Music.
[13:54.31]Best Score in Music.
[13:55.29]Doom Eternal.
[13:56.39]Nice, Doom.
[13:57.13]Play Doom OST.
[13:57.73]Final Fantasy VII Remake.

[14:05.16]Didn't play it.
[14:05.66]I don't know.
[14:06.34]And the winner is...
[14:07.84]It's going to be Doom Eternal or Hades.
[14:09.24]It's going to be Hades.
[14:12.39]We already know those songs!

[19:26.60]MMORPG.
[19:27.04]The breadth of what is considered an action adventure game also leads to this regularly being one of our most competitive categories.
[19:34.27]Incidentally, for the past three years, the Game Award winner for action adventure has gone on to win Game of the Year.
[19:41.13]So this is a big one.

[20:20.60]We want to thank the entire team at Naughty Dog who poured their heart and souls into this game.
[20:26.26]It's really their talent that immerses you in that world and really makes you feel like you're on this journey with Ellie.
[20:32.65]I want to thank Evan Wells, our president, also everyone at Sony and our partners for really helping us put this game together and get it out the door.
[20:42.46]And especially to our fans who supported us and really helped make this game something special.

[23:39.20]I'll show you how I fucking deal with the algorithm.

[29:08.61]Have you noticed that all VR games, for some reason... I don't know what this is.
[29:12.57]It seems like all VR games decide that, aesthetically, they're going to use, like, the big Mickey Mouse glove hands for, like, your hands.
[29:21.56]I feel like this in a lot of games.
[29:24.65]Is that, like, a decision for it?
[29:27.01]Is it easier to see, or... Why is that?
[29:31.04]You were polygons?
[29:32.06]Okay.
[29:32.36]So there's a reason.
[29:33.40]Okay.

[46:30.91]Character lists.
[46:32.15]And it was hilarious because there's no fucking way Sephiroth, Mega Man, Pac-Man, and, like, Solid Snake were gonna be in this.

[47:37.00]Oh yeah!
[47:57.93]Alright, the fun is just getting started.
[48:00.89]But of course, this show is also about awards.
[48:03.89]And to present our first award, you probably know her as Captain Marvel.
[48:07.04]She's an Oscar-winning actor, a filmmaker, and a dedicated activist.
[48:11.42]And she's joining us now live on Zoom.
[48:13.22]Brie Larson.
[48:13.92]Hey, Brie.
[48:14.36]Hello.
[48:18.25]It can be used for anything.
[48:18.93]Tonight, I am honored to present the award for best performance.
[48:22.52]Among the nominees is an inclusive group of talented actors filling vastly different roles in games that are nothing alike.
[48:29.54]However, these artists are nominated tonight for what they share in common.
[48:32.46]I can do any song, by the way.
[48:33.46]A clear dedication to their craft and an extraordinary ability to bring humanity and empathy to their roles.
[48:40.13]Here are the nominees for best performance.
[48:43.25]Alright, alright, alright, okay.
[48:52.57]The Khan deserves to suffer.

[49:27.99]Oh, wow.
[49:32.01]Wow.
[49:34.09]I was such a fan of the original Last of Us and of Troy and Ashley's performances within it.
[49:41.75]I fell in love with Joel and Ellie.
[49:43.83]So it is no surprise to me that Abby's role within this story has been met with such
[49:52.62]uh passionate responses but um to have been able to play she's incredibly talented like she just did such a fantastically challenging character who through her story enables the player to find forgiveness and empathy is something that I'll be eternally grateful for um oh man I told the team on the day that I finished filming that what I wanted more than anything was for my performance to
[50:23.04]to give a performance that honored the impact that the original game had on me.
[50:27.38]So this award means so much.
[50:30.47]Thank you to Neil and Hallie and the entire team for giving me the opportunity and for all of the support and the guidance along the way.
[50:39.45]To Patrick and Ian and Grace for everything you did, the story and Abby would not have been as impactful without you by my side.
[50:48.76]That was a, that was a, did you hear that ding?
[50:52.68]That wasn't me.
[50:53.34]That was on the screen.

[51:19.91]I think you're amazing and your, your strength and your power and your vulnerability and your performance left me speechless.

[52:31.82]Let's go.
[52:32.16]Let's see it.
[52:54.59]Pretty much since the day I started, there has been a really clear... Turn it on.
[52:58.23]I can't.
[52:59.33]I think the thing that makes it different from a lot of first-person games is it's not just about shooting.
[53:04.96]Eco-sci-fi is a term that we use.
[53:07.54]Future fiction, but from an ecological focus.
[53:10.32]There's been this ecological disaster.
[53:12.00]These corporations came in and they developed new technology.
[53:15.62]And on the surface, everything's...
[53:18.44]Everything's pretty great.
[53:19.28]We're still early in development, but we're really excited with where things are going.
[53:22.74]We wanted to share a cinematic piece that helps set the tone for our world.
[53:33.08]What is it?
[53:37.18]Cyberpunk.
[53:47.76]You don't have Twitch integration.
[53:49.78]I remember when everything changed.
[53:51.52]No, I am here.
[53:52.69]It's me.
[53:56.23]I turned my fucking big screen TV on and you guys all pulled into the driveway and you're just looking through the screen.
[54:00.81]I have a microphone that has speakers outside the window.
[54:04.09]I'm not doing Twitch integration or whatever.
[54:05.77]You're just in my driveway.
[54:08.71]The corporations gave us solutions.
[54:14.43]Yeah, you want drops?
[54:18.04]I like lift up the window and I'm like, hey, here comes a drop.
[54:21.34]It's like a whole printer that I don't use anymore.
[54:23.96]And I'm just like, boom.
[54:26.92]It smashes into the fucking pavement.
[54:29.89]There's no ink in there, by the way.
[54:31.41]You're going to have to get that yourself.
[55:00.58]You're a fly?
[55:05.64]Flight of the fly.
[55:10.33]I'm going to stop talking.
[55:11.81]I'm probably pissing people off.
[55:13.01]Did you find the answers you were looking for, Agent Dark?

[108:11.57]Streamer tries to pick up chicks on stream by talking about Celsius.
[108:18.67]Why would that be how?

[122:43.67]Don't do that.
[122:44.25]What?
[122:56.07]Three, you've gotta kill to heal.
[122:59.37]There's no use licking your wounds.

[123:04.21]Violence breeds vitality.
[123:07.48]Finally, guiding philosophy to end.
[123:11.12]You have to think aggressively.
[123:13.38]Shoot people in the head.
[123:15.34]Take their fucking heads off with knives and axes.
[123:19.27]Step four.
[123:21.13]Drown people's heads in water.
[123:22.95]Make it so they can't fucking breathe and then their last breath comes out and you watch it.
[123:27.81]Step five.
[123:29.07]Don't ever show nudity.
[123:30.73]Even one nipple.
[123:31.63]Don't ever do it.
[123:34.14]Don't- It's disgusting.
[123:35.28]Weird.
[123:36.60]Step six.

[124:56.00]Like 64 cores.
[125:13.41]Hey, what's up, guys?
[125:14.29]It's Tom Holland here.
[125:15.53]I am in Atlanta on the set of the next Spider-Man film, but I am honored to be a part of the Game Awards tonight.
[125:21.43]You know that for the past few years, I've been working on the Uncharted movie, which did involve some extensive research playing the games.
[125:27.45]I'm honored to be playing Nathan Drake.
[125:29.29]What I can assure you is that we really want to honor Naughty Dog's amazing games.
[125:33.72]So this film tells you how Nathan Drake became the character we all know and love.
[125:38.36]It is now my honor to introduce my good friend, Nathan Drake.
[125:42.06]Please welcome Mr. Nolan North.
[125:46.08]I thought it was going to be like a CG thing.
[125:49.70]I could not be more proud of you.
[125:51.12]You know, someday when someone searches for Nathan Drake on IMDB and you are the first result, I will only be remarkably bitter.
[125:59.67]You know, video games allow us to connect with friends, family, and complete strangers.
[126:04.52]We can share memorable experiences beyond the confines of our own homes, or even travel to vast new worlds with our buddies on the couch next to us.
[126:12.46]Of all the years I've been grateful for multiplayer games, they've never been more important to us than they were in this historically crappy, rotten, no-good, cursed year.
[126:22.24]These are the nominees for Best Multiplayer.
[126:25.80]Alright.
[126:27.46]Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
[126:29.12]Fortnite.

[127:13.41]Thank you, Game Awards and everyone who voted for us.
[127:16.53]And also congrats to all the other games nominated.
[127:18.74]It's an honor to have won best multiplayer category.
[127:22.86]Our goal with Among Us from the beginning was to create a fun experience amongst friends.
[127:28.77]Two years ago, Among Us started with local mobile and then online and PC, and the rest is history.
[127:35.53]They killed it, though.
[127:36.32]They really did.
[127:36.66]Now more than ever, finding ways to connect with friends is increasingly significant, and we're so happy many of you turned to Among Us to play with friends and family.
[127:45.63]Big thank you to Robot Teddy, Dual Studio, and our other partners for helping us navigate all the excitement.
[127:52.70]Thank you to our moderators and the fans who have been on this journey with us for the past two years.
[127:57.64]And big thank you to our friends and family.
[127:59.90]You've helped us test and been incredibly supportive through it all.
[128:03.59]Thank you so much.
[128:04.73]Thank you.
[128:06.89]Yeah, that's really cool.

[132:46.23]Are they going to fight?
[132:46.71]Oh, okay.
[132:47.05]It's just got a piano.
[132:47.93]Holy shit.
[133:08.03]That's a piano in the bedroom.
[133:09.17]Oh, come on.
[133:09.69]That's a bedroom piano.
[133:10.34]You were in a game, Karate Kid for Nintendo 1987.

[133:14.48]And your karate was weak.
[133:16.36]He's got a piano.

[133:49.27]I got you macho.
[133:51.45]And the winner is... He gets up and like leaves his room and opens the door and he comes in his room and they fucking start fighting.
[133:59.27]Awesome.
[134:00.81]Aw.
[134:02.40]Alright.
[134:03.14]Congratulations to Mortal Kombat and thanks to Ralph and Yuji.
[134:05.98]One of the things I have really been missing this year is flying around the world.
[134:09.66]But luckily we have one of the most beautiful games of the year to help fill that void a little.
[134:14.07]It just won Best Simulation Strategy Game, Microsoft Flight Simulator.
[134:17.90]And next year it's coming to Xbox.
[134:20.46]Seems eerily placed.
[134:23.50]By the way, we just had to skew it up just because, you know.
[134:26.30]We can take a look at Flight Simulator now.
[134:27.76]You know, it did just win Best Simulation category.
[134:32.27]We have the big screen behind us.
[134:33.51]Let's take a look at it.
[134:34.19]Why not?
[134:34.79]Let's see.
[134:47.71]Oh, God damn it, no.
[134:49.01]It's another DMCA.
[134:50.01]Fuck.
[134:50.11]These are big DMCA's.
[134:53.95]What do I- what do I do?
[134:55.39]A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A
[135:14.69]No more songs stop playing songs in my microphone I
[135:44.71]Alright, Microsoft Flight Simulator looks amazing coming next summer to Xbox.
[135:49.15]And now it's time to take a look at another game coming to PlayStation 5.
[135:53.51]Check it out.
[135:54.33]Wait, Jeff.
[135:56.44]PlayStation 5?
[135:56.80]This could be big.
[136:04.22]20k.
[136:04.42]Holy shit.
[136:04.92]Is this the highest?
[136:05.50]This is the most people that have ever been here.
[136:06.88]What?
[136:07.02]I will go there now.
[136:14.81]Holy shit.
[136:16.05]Yeah.
[136:16.41]17, 18 K was the carnival.
[136:17.69]Holy fuck.
[136:18.58]Oh, hi guys.
[136:19.90]Every time.
[136:20.96]What is this cycle?
[136:23.01]I'm trapped inside.
[136:48.52]And it looks cool, but again, I gotta say it again.
[136:51.86]Particle effects.
[136:52.80]Aquarium.
[136:53.48]Everything has to be lit up and exploding.
[136:56.29]Lights have to be everywhere.
[136:57.31]It looks cool.
[136:59.39]It does.
[137:04.57]It's just too many things.
[137:05.37]Too many explosions.
[137:14.93]It looks really cool.
[137:15.89]Alright, we will be back in just a moment with a man, a meme, a legend, Reggie.
[137:21.15]He's going to join us.
[137:22.35]We've also got a new look at a game from a guy you might remember from one of the craziest, most unscripted moments in Game Awards history, Joseph Fares.
[137:29.96]Plus, Eddie Vedder will play his song from The Last of Us, part two.
[137:33.52]And later, Jacksepticeye joins us from Europe.
[137:36.04]Really?
[137:36.46]Content creator of the year, presented by Adobe.
[137:39.52]Lots of great stuff coming up here on the Game Awards.
[137:42.60]We will see you right after this.
[137:47.93]What are you training for?
[137:49.89]What will you do with this strength?
[137:52.33]Could it be me?
[137:54.35]My answer to this question used to be simple.
[137:57.61]It's not so that I continue winning.
[138:00.97]I train so that I never lose again.
[138:09.71]I should just put myself up there as a category and when I don't win, just trash my room.
[138:14.15]Like put holes through walls and stuff.
[138:15.89]And like break my computer and stuff.
[138:22.79]Oh, and the winner for content creator of the week here is... And I'm like... Nice!
[138:27.92]Yeah!
[138:28.12]And just trash the room.
[138:55.40]Meat Boy.
[139:02.61]Meat Boy.
[139:04.79]Oh, I tried to play this game on my iPad and the whole game was black.
[139:08.13]I couldn't play anything.
[139:09.39]I was pissed and I looked up on the forums and everything.
[139:11.59]And it was like, hey, my game is like black too.
[139:13.73]All the graphics are black and I can't see anything.
[139:15.59]And I was like, when the fuck are they going to fix this?
[139:18.54]So I just uninstalled it and never looked back.
[139:21.63]Like, the mobile version is fucked up.
[139:25.82]Sorry, you're not gonna get my, like, $11,000 in buying, like, different, like, colored swords.
[139:32.96]I was ready to give it to you.
[139:58.70]It's a spyware game.
[140:00.35]Well, you just made me say that out loud.
[140:01.85]Is that real?
[140:02.71]No.
[140:03.12]That's somebody's opinion.
[140:05.37]That was somebody's opinion.
[140:06.61]Don't take anything I say seriously, please.
[140:09.32]This is Abby versus Ellie from The Last of Us Part II.
[140:12.16]I am team Ellie.
[140:12.94]Ellie is probably one of the greatest game characters of all time.
[140:15.42]Yeah, and Abby can beat her up, so that makes Abby better.
[140:17.76]Team Abby all day.
[140:18.84]What?
[140:19.80]I'm on team Edward.
[140:21.00]If she gets a nap and some food in her, she could probably deadlift a small car.
[140:24.30]And she's nice to dogs.
[140:25.22]Well, Ellie is an artist and a beautiful singer.
[140:27.80]Abby could be a good singer.
[140:28.72]You don't know.
[140:29.42]Yeah, you can tell she's not a good singer.
[140:31.02]Points makers don't make good singers.
[140:32.90]Fair enough.
[140:33.34]You win this round, Margaret.
[140:43.62]Wait, what?
[140:44.16]What is this?
[141:12.63]Okay, I'm interested.
[141:21.76]Thousands of roads.
[141:29.07]It's a car game.
[141:31.11]Alright.

[141:49.88]They're my favorite.
[141:50.48]What's the matter?

[142:37.02]I'm going to shut up for this one.
[142:38.70]He's in like a mo-cap suit.
[142:41.06]As you can see, I'm in the middle of a mo-cap shoot.
[142:44.93]Working on our next game, It Takes Two.
[142:47.79]Trust me when I say this, Hazelight's next co-op only experience, It Takes Two, is a blend narrative and a huge variety of gameplay never done before.
[142:56.59]And today we're going to have a gameplay reveal, a world exclusive.
[143:01.64]I know you like world exclusive, but this one is even extra exclusive, my man.

[143:09.26]This is the story of a magical king.
[143:35.26]One of wizards and warriors.
[143:38.92]Kids and a big dame set upon the high seas.
[143:42.63]An odyssey through time and space.
[143:49.39]It's also a bit of a winter wonderland, bobsled sort of thing, you know?
[143:55.72]What is this?
[143:56.92]Wait a minute.
[143:57.78]Did I mention the big explosion?

[144:05.80]Almost forgot they used to be humans.
[144:08.36]What the fuck is this?
[144:11.66]Do you want to know what this story is really about?
[144:17.58]This is the story of Cody and Meg.
[144:25.56]Why'd you look like a blob of clay?
[144:27.58]Wanna change back?
[144:28.82]Then you need to fix your relationship.
[144:35.47]Some of these environments look ridiculous I feel stuck
[145:02.32]Oh, I love it.
[145:02.78]It looks so cool.
[145:03.74]This looks so fun.

[146:10.73]An absolutely crazy game.
[146:11.99]Joseph showed that to me last summer when I was in Stockholm.
[146:14.35]I'm like, we have to show this off.
[146:15.57]There's so much gameplay there.
[146:16.87]Thank you for that, Joseph.
[146:18.15]Alright, now I'd like to welcome a longtime friend and supporter of the Game Awards.
[146:21.92]He was there in Vegas for our very first show back in 2014, and he's been back every year since.
[146:27.18]We weren't going to let the streets stop this year.
[146:29.28]The retired president and COO from Nintendo of America, but still a boss, Reggie Fils-Aimé.
[146:34.97]Reggie!
[146:37.45]Jeff, Jeff, how are you doing?
[146:39.57]I'm doing good, Reggie.
[146:40.76]Take it away.
[146:42.68]Absolutely.
[146:44.28]You know, I'm proud to present the very first award for innovation in accessibility.
[146:51.12]During my time at Nintendo, we had a mantra, gaming for the masses.
[146:55.91]And we pushed that agenda with Wii, Nintendo DS, and now Nintendo Switch.
[147:01.60]But today, approximately 1 billion people around the world experience some form of disability that makes gaming challenging for them.
[147:11.18]This award was created to highlight the efforts throughout the gaming industry to make software and hardware that enables games to be played and enjoyed by the widest and most inclusive audience possible.
[147:24.69]Because gaming is for everyone.
[147:27.79]Here are the nominees.
[147:30.79]Reggie just seriously being Emperor of Earth, seriously.
[147:35.18]He's awesome.
[148:00.67]I have to pee so bad.
[148:03.74]And the award goes to The Last of Us Part II.
[148:11.62]But if I leave, I got to go pee.
[148:13.26]But if I leave... Hello, I'm Matthew Young.
[148:17.20]I'm going to go pee right now.
[148:17.98]This is my fellow designer and neighbor, Amelia Schatz.
[148:21.56]And from everyone at Naughty Dog, we would like to thank you so much for honoring us with this year's Innovation and Accessibility Award.
[148:30.98]Thank you as well to the Game Awards for choosing to add this category and to all the other developers who have designed and advocated for accessibility in our games.
[148:39.81]We hope that together we can continue the momentum to push our industry forward.
[148:44.20]As developers, we know how one small design decision can unlock the entire game for a player.
[148:50.18]Games are special for their ability to blur the line between player and character, providing a means for personal engagement with narrative that is unrivaled in other artistic mediums.
[149:01.73]It's up to us to ensure that everyone can experience that for themselves.
[149:06.01]We'd like to thank our terrific group of accessibility consultants, and we absolutely could not have done it without your insight and your detailed feedback.
[149:14.72]Thank you.
[149:16.56]We'd also like to thank our partners at Worldwide Studios, our senior producer, Sam Thompson, the user experience research team, and our dedicated accessibility QA testers.
[149:28.79]And we'd also like to thank everybody at Naughty Dog.
[149:32.25]This was truly a team effort, and every department had a part to play in removing barriers for players with disabilities.
[149:39.88]Lastly, we'd like to thank you, the players.
[149:42.76]Nothing makes us prouder than hearing stories from players who were able to experience The Last of Us Part II without assistance, using our accessibility features to remove barriers that would have otherwise excluded them.
[149:54.86]From both of us, thank you so much.
[149:57.79]Thank you.
[150:01.15]Congratulations to Naughty Dog, such an important category, and I'm proud that we're able to recognize innovation and accessibility here at the Game Awards.
[150:06.90]We're going to do that every year moving forward.
[150:08.42]This next world premiere gives us our first glimpse at next year's Big Adventure for The Elder Scrolls Online.
[150:13.99]What if I miss Elden Ring?
[150:16.09]I'm going to miss Elden Ring.
[150:18.37]Elder Scrolls Online?
[150:19.93]I don't give a shit.
[150:20.45]I'll be back.
[150:48.12]I see us.
[150:49.44]Thank you.
[151:32.04]From imposters in Among Us to the visual beauty of Genshin Impact, mobile gaming has had an incredible year.
[151:39.05]Coming up, I'll be revealing the winner of best mobile game presented by LG Wing, the world's first 5G swivel smartphone, powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon.
[151:49.49]and later, the first look at a brand new map from Among Us.

[153:01.02]So I had to like, I didn't have any, there was no paper towels available.
[153:02.94]So I had to take the back of my hand and like scrape the water like into the sink.

[153:08.54]No, I don't fucking wait.
[153:09.32]I don't believe that.
[153:10.72]It's only been like two, three minutes.
[153:15.07]I did not miss Elden Ring.
[153:16.15]There's no way.
[153:23.40]I seriously did.

[157:04.65]It's Exodus.
[157:15.70]To present our next award, she's a host and producer from IGN.
[157:18.34]It's been a long time.
[157:18.92]And your host for the Game Awards pre-show, this is Sydney Goodman.
[157:23.06]Sydney.
[157:27.98]Mobile games were once defined by their limitations.
[157:31.70]In a way, we celebrated the games that excelled despite their platform.
[157:36.48]As technology has closed the gap, releasing on phones is no longer a limitation.
[157:42.04]It's an asset.
[157:43.38]It's never been more apparent than tonight, where the nominees for best mobile game have found massive audiences because of their platform.
[157:52.49]Here they are.
[157:53.25]That shit didn't work on my iPad.
[157:55.27]Better not be.
[157:57.35]Buggy and shitty?
[157:58.19]No.
[157:58.53]That shit better not be.
[158:02.25]I have no idea.
[158:09.47]No.
[158:10.21]No.
[158:10.71]No.
[158:11.15]No.
[158:11.61]No.
[158:14.31]Now I take to the sky.
[158:24.45]It's going to be Among Us.
[158:25.29]It has to be.
[158:25.97]And the Game Award goes to... It's going to be Among Us.
[158:30.75]Among Us.
[158:31.35]Right.
[158:31.57]I mean, yeah, of course.
[158:32.27]It's like the most played game in the history of the universe right now.
[158:39.32]Thank you, Game... Oh, my gosh.
[158:41.08]Thank you again, Game Awards and everyone who voted for us.
[158:45.70]And congrats again to all the other games that were nominated.
[158:49.06]We originally designed our game Among Us to be played on mobile devices.
[158:52.48]Somebody's just come out of the bathtub, look around in the outfit and be like, oh shit, and go back in the bathtub.
[158:57.34]We wanted our game to be accessible at any level of gamer and wanted to create a fun experience to be shared amongst friends and family and whoever.
[159:04.97]We want to thank our players first and foremost.
[159:08.27]Among Us would not be where it is today
[159:11.57]same joke when it was mobile local only no or played for the first time just yesterday thank you from the four of us um again big thank you to robot teddy dual studio and all of our other partners for helping us during all of this um and thank you to our moderators and the fans who have been on this journey with us for the
[159:34.71]One joke, Andy.
[159:35.49]What?
[159:35.75]One joke, Andy.
[159:36.43]No, I'm not.
[159:37.20]Monster Hunter Rise?
[159:38.06]Is this new shit?
[159:39.10]Is this actually new shit?
[159:40.28]Or is this they just remade it for the Switch?
[159:44.98]I don't.
[160:06.94]A huge pack of monsters in a giant stampede.
[160:10.77]They attack the village in a frenzied rage.
[160:13.35]It's new.
[160:14.01]Okay, hold on.
[160:14.69]Nobody knows why this happens, but it came close to wiping out our village last time.
[160:29.03]It was announced a while ago.
[160:35.88]It's still cool, though.
[160:44.64]Okay.
[160:44.74]A lot of things coming out in March.
[160:46.34]March is going to be a big month.
[160:47.98]Play the demo.
[160:48.52]Cool.
[160:48.76]That's cool.
[160:49.18]That one looks kind of fun.
[161:15.69]Alright, over on Twitch, the next poll is for Content Creator of the Year.
[161:19.92]Vote now for who you think is going to win, and we'll find out in a little bit who wins that category.
[161:24.12]But next up, he's one of our industry's great performers, and he plays Joel in The Last of Us.
[161:28.67]Here is Troy Baker.
[161:34.37]One day on the set of The Last of Us Part I, Neil, our writer and director, asked me and Ashley what we would have been if we weren't actors.
[161:42.94]I thought about it for a second and replied that I always imagined I would have been a singer.
[161:48.36]Ashley just shrugged and
[161:50.28]And her charming and off-handed way said, Dare you be some charming... Fry, how dare you be the most charming and handsome man!
[161:57.95]Into Ellie and Joel.
[162:00.03]Space and music became major elements of their stories, creating touching moments between them.
[162:06.89]One of those moments, now indelible in our memories, incorporated Neil's story as well.
[162:12.87]Oh, you're making us all look bad!
[162:14.21]Not as a writer, but as a father.
[162:17.20]It involved a song he would play and sing to his daughter every night.
[162:21.64]That song was Pearl Jam's Future Days.
[162:25.46]One day, Neil asked if I was comfortable playing it in a scene he was writing for The Last of Us Part II.
[162:31.23]Now, I don't generally get nervous, but I understood what that song meant to Neil and to the game.
[162:39.09]And the truth is, Neil can play that song better than me.
[162:42.67]but nobody can play it better than the person that wrote it.
[162:46.19]From Seattle, performing Future Days, here's Eddie Vedder.
[162:51.08]Is this okay?
[162:53.80]Is this okay?
[162:55.46]This is just like a song.
[162:56.50]I'd surely lose myself Everything I have found, dear I'm not bound by myself
[163:12.36]Somebody just said, is this the guy from the Weird Al song?
[163:24.55]I am way older than you.
[163:27.85]Are you serious?
[163:29.63]That's how you know him?
[163:33.14]No, dude.
[163:34.40]What the fuck?
[163:37.52]Come on.
[163:38.32]Alright.
[163:40.08]I'm just going to be quiet.
[163:44.95]Earl James is almost 40 years old.
[163:51.71]That's insane to think about.
[163:53.29]Yeah.
[163:59.67]I'm 18.
[163:59.81]Who is this guy?
[164:02.77]Start asking for Prime?
[164:05.15]Like, is this a lot of people here?
[164:07.28]No, don't sub to this channel.
[164:08.68]What, are you nuts?
[164:09.74]Break 20k.
[164:10.82]Hey, everybody.
[164:30.95]I don't even have notifications anyway, so I don't even know.
[164:35.75]I can't even tell.
[164:44.42]I said it.
[164:44.94]Somebody got me to say it.
[164:46.96]But I'm not saying anything.
[164:48.14]I'm not doing any notifications.
[164:50.80]Nothing.
[164:52.34]Thank you for the subs.
[164:53.10]I appreciate it.
[164:53.52]But I ain't saying anything.
[164:55.49]Not during the Game Awards.
[164:58.55]When floods they came and tides they raised.
[165:02.87]20K, start talking about thrive.
[165:09.82]Do people do that?
[165:10.80]I feel like that's so obvious and so stupid.
[165:14.86]I've met them like Doris.
[165:19.75]All my demons used to come around.
[165:23.62]How come I'm not on the Game Awards?
[165:28.79]Guys, I'm probably on a banned list somewhere.
[165:32.33]You're a brand risk?
[165:33.43]I don't think I'm... Am I?
[165:37.49]I don't think I'm a brand risk.
[165:53.87]Could I?
[165:54.19]No.
[165:57.29]I mean, I did show, like, me and Chuck E. Cheese kissing on stream, right?
[166:01.03]But, like, that's... Whatever.
[166:02.67]Is that a brand risk?
[166:12.60]The dump truck ass.
[166:14.08]Whatever.
[166:20.20]He's a powerful rat.
[166:23.99]Alright, so that was the song Future Days, and that song you might recognize from The Last of Us.
[166:33.60]And I really appreciate the way that was used, especially bringing Joel and Ellie together, connecting through music.
[166:46.41]And I thought maybe it was cool, too, that it made you
[166:50.05]want to perhaps pick up a guitar yourself and and write a song for your loved one um but uh it is nice to be part of this uh show my appreciation and be part of this year game awards and um what a fascinating way to tell a story it's just getting better and better all the time and um it was cool to be part of it so uh thanks for having me and enjoy the rest of the show
[167:22.01]Nice, very nice.
[167:22.87]Doesn't get better than that.
[167:24.19]Thank you so much, Eddie Vedder, for being here on The Game Awards.
[167:27.29]Alright, now here's another brand-new game to show you for the first time.
[167:35.30]Elden Ring.
[167:37.66]This is it.
[167:38.82]This is it.
[167:40.24]No, it's not.
[167:42.88]You can run for a long time.
[167:51.19]Already very interested.
[168:23.06]What the hell is going on here?
[168:29.51]Like Van Helsing?
[168:44.32]Evil West.
[168:51.88]was the exact same font the exact same text just missing a couple evil dead that was kind of odd there you go evil west alright on Twitch we asked you to predict the winners in content creator of the year and the Twitch audience uh said valkyrie with uh 44 of the vote they think is gonna win so the award for content creator of the year is coming up next
[169:14.63]It's coming up next.
[169:15.35]It's coming up next.
[169:15.99]Let's go.
[169:16.49]Let's check the hairline.
[169:17.19]We got to check it every now and again.
[169:18.63]How's it doing?
[169:19.11]It's okay.
[169:38.02]It's okay.
[169:38.48]The virtual brain link cable will now be connected.
[169:40.61]It's alright.
[169:41.35]It'll be alright for another 10 years.
[169:43.07]Much more than it did in training.
[169:44.77]Be strong.
[169:47.09]Beginning SAS cable connection.
[170:02.01]Good.
[170:02.65]Seems like you're okay.
[170:05.59]New recruit.
[170:10.60]mysterious scum.
[170:11.48]How about last year's theme was constant conflict?
[170:21.45]This year's theme is constant particle effects.
[170:39.88]Yeah, this has pushed the hardware to 98% CPU usage 100% of the time you play.
[170:45.14]Change the title.
[171:09.86]I didn't see Elden Ring yet.
[171:12.74]I didn't see it.
[171:13.26]It didn't happen.
[171:13.86]We're waiting for Elden Ring.
[171:20.94]I did not miss it.
[171:21.90]It's coming up soon.
[171:22.82]It's gonna be a huge deal.
[171:23.92]I am often depressed when I look at the status of where we are in terms of depression and anxiety and inattention.
[171:32.89]We owe it to all the people that are suffering to be really creative and to try things that when you first hear it, it sounds crazy.
[171:39.21]I didn't miss it.
[171:39.97]It's coming.
[171:41.45]It's gonna be a huge reveal.
[171:43.37]I am a neuroscientist and a neurologist.
[171:46.63]It started for me 12 years ago.
[171:49.27]I became really interested in this idea of creating experiences as a way of improving brain function.
[171:55.03]And this relies on a principle called neuroplasticity, the fact that our brain reshapes itself and modifies itself in response to challenges.
[172:02.74]And so that's how it all started for me to create a video game that was carefully designed to challenge and reward the brain in a very specific way.
[172:11.60]And so it just happened a couple months ago, the FDA cleared Endeavor Rx as a medical device to treat inattention in children that have ADHD.
[172:21.55]This is the first time ever that the FDA has cleared a video game for any medical condition.
[172:27.27]So what we're talking about right now is to have a video game prescribed, just like we prescribe pills for conditions, and think about this as a new type of medicine.
[172:41.21]That's really cool.
[172:41.71]The world is a dangerous place.
[172:45.49]Only the best can keep it safe.
[172:48.83]Become a tier one operative.
[172:52.16]Plan.
[172:53.62]Position.
[172:56.64]And execute.
[173:01.12]Fuck the face cam.
[173:02.80]It's not on.
[173:03.70]It's not on, man.
[173:05.58]Join the elite.
[173:07.08]Bring the thunder.
[173:08.87]Thunder tier one.
[173:11.92]What?
[173:12.06]What the hell is that?
[173:38.44]Alright, too long on the end.
[173:39.40]Too long, way too long on the end.
[173:40.62]Way too long on the end.
[173:42.24]That was like uncomfortably long at the very end there.
[173:44.48]Remember, are you going to donate your gamer poop?
[174:08.21]I read that wrong.
[174:14.67]Yeah, that's called I played Fortnite for 12 hours, went to Taco Bell and got one of everything on the menu because I hadn't eaten today.
[174:24.74]That's tomorrow.
[174:25.72]That's what we see tomorrow.
[174:42.30]There's the brand risk.
[174:45.88]Whatever.
[174:46.20]Welcome back.
[174:46.94]As you just saw, EA Play is available now on new consoles, Steam, and Origin.
[174:50.86]It includes Star Wars, Jedi Fallen Order, one of our nominees tonight, and a great game.
[174:55.31]Alright.
[174:55.89]Now on to one of the biggest games this year.
[174:58.21]It was created by three developers in Seattle.
[175:00.03]Now four.
[175:00.47]You saw them.
[175:01.05]They've won two awards tonight.
[175:02.69]Interslot.
[175:03.21]They absolutely took over the internet with Among Us.
[175:06.19]Well, they sent us something special.
[175:07.55]This is the reveal of the brand new map for Among Us.
[175:12.01]Check it out, crewmates.
[175:12.97]Oh, God!
[175:14.86]This map looks pretty sick to me!
[175:17.66]Oh, my God!
[175:36.65]Hey, guys!
[175:37.11]Don't tell anybody!
[175:38.35]I'm currently in the vent!
[175:39.46]Grow down, recruitment!
[175:40.56]Get yourself acquainted with the layout of the top-edition.
[175:43.14]I'm gonna tell that vent-tale this guy!
[175:45.42]Stop shitting!
[175:46.20]Don't tell anybody!
[175:50.10]You may need to take a ladder to get to certain areas.
[175:52.76]Or maybe just take a nice shortcut.
[175:55.73]Quit grouping up.
[175:56.77]Choose a room to start in after a meeting.
[175:59.51]It's attached to my face now.
[176:00.97]I can't get enough of this stuff.
[176:02.95]Stop their plan.
[176:05.82]keep your eyes peeled we definitely have an imposter here whoa whoa
[176:28.85]Yeah, I went like this.
[176:29.49]What are you doing?
[176:29.98]The impostor is sus!
[176:47.19]I would have shattered on the ground.
[176:49.03]He's a hilarious content creator with over 25 million subs and over 13 billion views.
[176:54.55]He's joining us now live from the UK, Jacksepticeye.
[176:58.82]Hello, Jack.
[177:00.08]What's up?
[177:01.04]Everybody loves Jack.
[177:01.84]Come on, let's hear it.

[177:02.84]How's it going?
[177:03.58]Hello, everyone at the Game Awards.
[177:05.84]In a year when so many of us were separated from our family and friends, one thing remained the same.
[177:11.60]Our favorite content creators were still there for us.
[177:14.62]Their streaming, gaming, and sharing helped us fill the hours and feel connected, unifying us all with our shared passion for play.
[177:22.95]Here are the nominees for Content Creator of the Year.
[177:27.29]Content Creator of the Year, presented by Adobe.

[179:07.69]Joining me right now is the chief creative officer of Epic Games, Donald Mustard.
[179:12.84]Donald, it is great to have you on the show.
[179:14.54]It's a yearly tradition, new Fortnite season.
[179:17.65]What can you tell us?
[179:19.89]Oh, man.
[179:20.29]It's so awesome to be here.
[179:21.37]It's so awesome to see you.
[179:22.05]You've lost 2K viewers?
[179:22.83]This is amazing, Jeff.
[179:24.07]You did this yet again.
[179:26.64]So yeah, I was so excited right now.
[179:29.22]New season has started.
[179:30.28]We just all battled Galactus together with our favorite Marvel heroes.
[179:34.38]And what that's done is it's left the Fortnite zero point exposed.
[179:37.95]And Agent Jones is looking for all these hunters throughout all these different realities that can help him stop anyone from escaping from Fortnite.
[179:46.27]And we've already seen several characters come in.
[179:49.29]And we have one more that he's bringing in.
[179:51.52]Somebody said, please talk.
[179:52.68]I can't stand the capitalism.
[179:54.74]What do you want to do?
[179:56.81]I can't solve that, like... I can't, like, suck on my thing and solve, like, capitalism for you.
[180:03.92]What do you... I... Please, help us.
[180:17.03]Help us.
[180:28.36]Master Chief comes.
[180:29.80]Wait, Master Chief is in Fortnite?
[180:32.85]You know what's wicked funny?
[180:33.51]Isn't that crazy?
[180:34.85]Master Chief is one of my most favorite characters ever in anything.
[180:39.29]Nobody kind of cared.
[180:41.25]Nobody was like, Pog, Pog.
[180:42.33]I didn't even hear it.
[180:43.77]I didn't care.
[180:44.80]It's weird.
[180:45.98]Nobody cared.
[180:46.62]The coolest thing is he's going to be available tonight in Fortnite.
[180:50.26]You can go and get Master Chief.
[180:52.90]I heard that and I was like, did I hear something in my ear?
[180:56.20]Everyone in the chat was like, whatever.
[180:57.87]Yeah, so I think, you know, we didn't want it to stop right there.
[181:01.13]And so there's something else I think we should check out.
[181:04.85]Oh, he's already in the game.
[181:07.21]Well, hello, sir.
[181:08.87]It's an honor.
[181:11.37]Hey, Sarge, did you hear?
[181:12.37]Oh, I guess you already got the news.
[181:14.78]What news?
[181:15.74]Master Chief is coming to Fortnite.
[181:17.86]What now?
[181:18.70]It's only one of the most popular video games in the world.
[181:21.62]Is this kind of a big deal?
[181:22.30]But more obviously, it's where we are right now.
[181:25.78]Huh.
[181:27.38]Wait a minute, if you had no idea that we're in Fortnite, then why do you have a cardboard cutout of Master Chief?
[181:33.95]Perfectly regular reasons.
[181:36.67]Whoa, you guys new around here?
[181:39.07]No!
[181:40.35]The chief got eliminated by a sneaky blue!
[181:43.38]That's no blue!
[181:44.64]That's... that's Ninja!
[181:46.62]It's such an honor.
[181:48.04]I'm a huge fan of yours on Twitch.
[181:49.86]Twitch?
[181:50.52]Is he twitching because he's blue?
[181:52.04]Stop making us look bad in front of Ninja!
[181:54.23]We're Sergeant Grif from the popular web series Red vs. Blue.
[181:57.35]You probably watched it about ten years ago.
[181:59.85]What are you doing here?
[182:01.55]Well, it's more than just the chief coming to Fortnite.
[182:04.37]This map is too.
[182:05.75]It'll be in creative mode starting at 10 a.m.
[182:07.70]Eastern time tomorrow.
[182:10.14]Peter, Peter, we're in Fortnite.
[182:11.38]Remember the time when I was in Fortnite?
[182:13.88]I'm pretty sure it was called something else.
[182:16.84]Remember the time when I was in Fortnite?
[182:19.62]Hey, Lawrence.
[182:20.08]Stop it.
[182:20.40]What's with the stream?
[182:21.80]And maybe add your own personal touches to the map.
[182:24.34]Hey, wait.
[182:25.02]Does that mean we can have dance battles?
[182:27.62]Come on, Ninja.
[182:28.49]What do you say?
[182:30.72]Eh.
[182:31.06]Make it stop.
[182:31.68]I can't solve all your issues here.
[182:33.81]What do you want to do?
[182:34.51]Oh, I got it.
[182:36.77]Oh, wait.
[182:37.09]That looked like I was... Guys versus blue, Donald.
[182:40.47]I'm here.
[182:40.83]Yeah, isn't that so awesome and so funny?
[182:43.85]So what's awesome about that is that Blood Gulch was recreated in Fortnite Creative by this awesome creative team that call themselves Atlas Creative.
[182:53.65]And tomorrow at 10 a.m.
[182:55.78]Eastern, you'll be able to go to Fortnite.
[182:58.20]Whatever, it's cool.
[182:58.98]Reverse glue is cool.
[182:59.48]And a recreated version of Blood Gulch.
[183:02.36]Oh, my God.
[183:02.84]It's going to be fun.
[183:03.60]Everything is in Fortnite right now.
[183:05.70]So are you done for the season?
[183:08.89]You know, I mean, Agent Jones is a... That really was a Family Guy joke.
[183:12.89]Hey, Lois, remember the time that Red vs. Blue invited us into Fortnite and we played with Ninja?
[183:18.68]It really is.
[183:19.16]I can't get over that.
[183:42.50]How many?
[183:43.14]I have no idea where we're going next, but I'm on board.
[183:46.90]Thanks, Jeff.
[183:47.87]Alright.
[183:48.41]Are they taking a cue from Smash Brothers?
[183:50.23]Come up in a moment.
[183:51.07]Keanu Reeves is going to present the award for best game direction.
[183:54.29]Just put in everybody.
[183:56.73]Don't go anywhere.
[183:57.83]Are the Three Stooges in it?
[184:01.07]We talked about that, right?
[184:02.35]When the Three Stooges get added to Fortnite, then you know we're there.
[184:05.77]I am stoked to be welcoming to the Rocket League's vibrant community in such a big way.
[184:10.73]I'm excited to work with Psyonix and Monstercat to put together an EP for Rocket League's music season.
[184:17.00]Fortnite is directed towards kids.
[184:18.30]Why do kids like all these older actors?
[184:19.80]You can get the featured anthem in the item shop and grab my free banner all weekend long.
[184:25.32]Let's check out the Season 2 trailer featuring my brand new track that I made just for you guys.
[184:30.97]I mean, maybe a little bit, yeah.
[184:44.02]What is this?
[184:46.71]Is this the Fortnite?
[184:47.37]This is the Fortnite concert thing they did, right?
[184:49.55]They had a big concert in Fortnite.
[184:56.86]This is Rocket League?
[184:58.46]Oh, okay.
[184:58.80]Never mind.
[184:59.22]Wrong game.
[185:02.90]Oh, that's a Jerma985 car.
[185:07.48]Or every other one of us, of like the thousands of us on Twitch, that thinks cyan and pink looks great.
[185:14.94]You know?
[185:19.67]I love it.
[185:20.61]I love it.
[185:25.11]Or teal and pink.
[185:30.63]It's my favorite color scheme.
[185:32.52]So how don't you dare say anything about it.
[185:37.79]Xbox Game Pass, December 15th.
[185:44.76]Your next favorite game is a game that came out 20 years ago.
[185:48.72]It's not really your next favorite game.
[185:51.36]It's an old favorite of yours that you liked a while ago.
[185:54.68]Alright.
[186:01.94]Does anybody kind of hope that like the source code for Skyrim gets lost?
[186:04.63]I'll say it.
[186:10.53]So they can't keep doing it?
[186:28.28]How could you say something so controversial?
[186:31.74]Just say like it.
[186:33.26]They gotta stop.
[186:33.94]They gotta stop.
[186:34.78]They gotta stop it.
[186:40.79]That was so brave to say.
[186:45.32]So brave.
[186:48.26]I mean, like, oh my god, LOL.
[186:50.32]Skyrim keeps coming out?
[186:51.92]They gotta stop doing that.
[186:52.90]I'm so different and contrarian, aren't I?
[187:00.84]Actually, the real contrarian thing would say, I hope they release Skyrim for PS5.
[187:04.42]So I'm gonna say that.
[187:07.85]I really hope that they release Skyrim for PS5 unlocked.
[187:16.71]With like 10% better shaders or something.
[187:21.77]That's the real brave thing to say.
[187:23.21]Oh, Yakuza.
[187:47.32]GTA 5 is the one that should fill those shoes now.
[187:49.35]Yeah.
[187:50.98]We'll see when GTA 6 decides to get announced.
[187:52.53]Just check Pokémon Go on my phone, and there's Wooper everywhere, so we can officially declare another Wooper Watch.
[188:00.15]Wooper!
[188:00.29]Team Go Barbie Grunts are also appearing in balloons and at PokeStops, and you can save Shadow Wooper from their villainous clutches.
[188:07.70]Make Wooper your buddy, take photos of it with Go Smash Shot, and battle with it in Go Battle League.
[188:13.00]My camera sucks.
[188:13.76]If you're enjoying Wooper Watch, you'll love Pokémon Go's December Community Day.
[188:17.80]My camera looks awful.
[188:18.24]It's happening this weekend.
[188:20.06]So grainy.
[188:21.06]Just to hide all my things that I have here.
[188:25.37]I'm never going to upgrade my camera because then you'll be able to see the blemishes that are on my face.
[188:29.71]It's blurred enough where you can't see any of the problems that I have.
[188:33.85]Got one right here.
[188:34.53]You have no idea.
[188:35.21]It's kind of blurry.
[188:38.91]I've got a little spot right in my eye right here.
[188:40.47]You can't see that.
[188:41.27]You have no idea.
[188:43.10]I'm in forever 720.
[188:43.80]Never going up.
[188:55.10]Take off slow mode.
[188:55.78]Alright, if one of the mods is wrong, take off slow mode for one minute.
[189:00.57]Just have to be just chaos.
[189:02.15]Turn it off.
[189:10.21]One of the mods just said, fuck.
[189:17.20]Fuck.
[189:21.29]People are getting timed out because they're spamming.
[189:27.47]I can't even read the chat.
[189:29.31]It's impossible.
[189:31.44]Alright, you can put it back on.
[189:51.77]Put it back on.
[189:54.69]Scribe of Avalon, Fallout 76.
[189:56.21]Oh, don't care.

[191:54.59]This is by Riot?
[191:56.11]Whose strength is only eclipsed by his kindness.
[191:59.46]I mean, they're technically still like an indie studio, right?
[192:01.98]Even though they grossed like a billion dollars in revenue last year.
[192:05.56]Praise upon the women.
[192:07.30]You feel it.
[192:11.41]Are they?
[192:11.97]No, that's right.
[192:13.01]No, not anymore.
[192:13.69]This is not an indie studio.
[192:14.67]Did they say indie before this came on?
[192:16.63]They did.

[192:17.75]What?
[192:36.12]can't match my blade small indie studio blizzard what brought them together nothing good I reckon

[192:53.21]I thought somebody in chat just put in all capitals, fuck turn-based chat.
[192:57.77]But it was turn-based combat.
[192:58.91]I read it like, oh, fuck turn-based chat.
[193:00.55]Like, what the fuck?
[193:01.05]I'm going to talk like slow mode.
[193:02.62]I thought they were making a slow mode thing.

[193:11.84]Here he comes.
[193:12.46]He's going to get on that stage.

[194:53.36]Man, what a year.
[194:55.36]It's an honor to be in this category with such incredible games.
[194:59.92]Direction is nothing without a team to internalize it, make it their own, and turn it into a game.
[195:05.51]And we're privileged to have such an amazing team, cast, outsourcing partners, our partners at Sony.
[195:12.01]Every single person that worked on, touched this game helped shape it.

[195:36.98]The big one game of the year presented by Christopher Nolan.
[195:40.42]I'm going to turn to have a tribute to all the nominees performed by the London.
[195:44.14]I'm taking my headphones off of this one.
[195:47.58]Like I said when people still see VR is kind of this like tech demo toy thing Where it's like it's not really games.
[195:54.40]It's not a real game It's like you know Look at your hands and like throw the bottles on the ground right until people kind of stop seeing it as that You'll never see a win like that Very gimmicky until people get that out of their heads Fuck is this GTA what?

[196:16.48]WHAT THE FUCK?!
[196:17.40]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[196:18.66]Oh, yeah, it's just GTA.
[196:19.88]Whatever.
[196:20.12]GTA 1.
[196:20.34]Um...
[196:40.37]Okay, I can hear it.
[196:55.68]Anyways, um... The fact that VR is still a toy.
[197:01.01]An expensive toy.
[197:04.07]But the game, like, the outs were so well-paced.
[197:07.17]It was such a fun game.
[197:08.07]It was the game of the year.
[197:08.79]My game of the year.
[197:09.47]Whatever.
[197:11.85]After having federated the African continent, she set out to conquer Rome.
[197:16.35]It was on witnessing the consequences of this terrible battle that she decided to impose upon her people a strictly vegetarian diet.
[197:27.34]And it's in 1082, following the unexplained death of the king, that she was crowned empress of Spain.
[197:35.01]It's in fact to celebrate this event that rock and roll was invented.
[197:39.61]What the fuck?
[197:42.58]In 1789, allied with the valiant Japanese, she discovered the real Indies, which had fallen into the hands of the bloody French.
[197:54.43]This was followed by the Great Devastation, a 100-year war that Lucy had amended before beginning the Great Reconstruction, and establishing a lasting peace by banishing all forms of currency and violence, as well as the use of selfie sticks in museums.
[198:12.83]Lucy, are you with us?
[198:14.61]Is this CG?
[198:15.45]Is this a cutscene?
[198:16.67]Is this filmed in real life?
[198:17.73]Is this...
[198:23.97]How far will you push humankind?
[198:29.88]Was that a cut scene?
[198:30.88]That looked fucking real.
[198:33.22]We've been having fun with Instagram's Game of the Year AR effects.

[199:02.14]Well, shit.
[199:04.28]How bad have things gotten?
[199:07.36]The Jerma occupation has turned every neighbor into a possible enemy.
[199:11.52]We need more resistance members, but that's much easier said than done.
[199:20.51]Drop your weapons.

[201:33.81]Roger.
[201:34.07]Copy.
[201:35.63]Eagle Houston, you're a go for landing.
[201:37.21]Over.
[201:54.45]Doesn't look like Elderman.
[201:57.23]Mass Effect?
[201:57.83]Maybe?
[201:58.33]Yeah?
[201:58.69]I don't know.
[202:24.59]Mass Effect 4?
[202:25.51]No.
[202:29.07]This better not be like Destiny 2 DLC.
[202:32.25]Better not be.
[202:32.93]Mass Effect...
[202:51.30]Oh we're not sure what number but it's gonna happen at some point.

[203:04.31]I can't wait to see where BioWare is going to take that next.
[203:08.39]Very exciting.
[203:09.03]Alright.
[203:09.27]Well, to present our final award, this man has created some of the most iconic films of all time, some of which screened this summer in Fortnite.
[203:16.64]And on December 20th, I'll be sitting down for a conversation with him on YouTube to talk about the home release of Tenet and his illustrious career.
[203:23.76]And if you've got questions for him, which I'm sure you do, send them our way using the hashtag AskNolan on Twitter.
[203:30.21]But right now, without further ado, to present Game of the Year, it's my honor to introduce Christopher Nolan.
[203:35.41]Hey, Chris.
[203:36.09]This guy couldn't care less about this whole show.
[203:38.26]It's an honor to be part of Game Awards.
[203:41.52]I've always been interested in telling stories that immerse the audience.
[203:45.42]I like movies that unfold in unexpected ways and pull people into a world.
[203:51.23]When I look at video games, I see a lot of parallels with that kind of storytelling, how a player's agency and choice intersect with more traditional storytelling methods.
[204:00.46]It's exciting to see and really quite groundbreaking.
[204:04.72]Tonight, all six nominees for Game of the Year are true masterworks in immersive storytelling.
[204:10.26]To pay tribute to them, please welcome from Abbey Road Studios, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by my old friend, Lorne Belfie.
[204:21.36]Alright, game of the year.
[204:25.44]I'm looking for a Hades win here.
[204:30.39]Not this one.
[204:31.59]I didn't play this one, but I wasn't really into it.
[204:55.68]Are there other nominees?
[204:56.64]Is this it?
[205:01.01]The only nominee.
[205:03.23]Okay, here we go.
[205:12.45]People really like this Doom, right?
[205:14.37]People really liked all these, but I mean... It's Hades angle.
[205:21.16]It's just not.
[205:21.56]Let's be honest.
[205:32.47]This looked really fun, but I never played it, so I can't give a real opinion on this year.
[205:36.63]I really can't.
[205:58.60]Is this the favorite?
[205:59.32]Is Last of Us 2 the favorite?
[206:02.78]Well, I don't know.
[206:03.34]Maybe they'll be an upset.
[206:08.70]I'll tell you who I'm rooting for.
[206:09.66]I'm rooting for... I'll tell you, I'm probably rooting for... I'm rooting for Hades.
[206:13.98]If Hades doesn't win... Yeah, there it is.
[206:16.87]Let's go.
[206:18.81]Let's go.
[206:27.79]If Hades doesn't get, like, half the screen time, the Final Fantasy VII... Okay, I was going to say, what the fuck is that?
[206:54.82]Animal Crossing, I mean... Hades, Doom, or Animal Crossing could be like... I could, you know, it's been a while, right?
[207:11.07]I want Hades to win.
[207:18.99]Half-Life Alyx isn't on this list, which is dumb.
[207:25.29]Like, I actually can't believe that.
[207:27.09]What a big step in, like, the space if they were to win Game of the Year.
[207:30.81]But whatever.
[207:31.63]We can't.
[207:32.17]Let's not complain.
[207:32.75]Well, that sounded fantastic.
[207:34.19]And now, the Game of the Year award goes to...
[207:39.62]The Last of Us 2.
[207:41.78]It's the favorite.
[207:43.15]It won.
[207:43.53]It won everything.
[207:44.55]It won every award.
[207:46.87]It won best direction, best game, best fucking music.
[207:51.50]Again, a big congrats to all the other games we're nominated with.
[207:56.39]Everyone at Naughty Dog, I can't wait to hug and high five and get drunk with each one of you.

[209:11.21]I'm not done yet.
[209:11.99]I'm not going to give my final thoughts.
[209:14.07]Don't leave my stream.
[209:14.57]Go there afterwards.
[209:15.19]I didn't even see Elden Ring.
[209:16.05]I did actually miss Elden Ring.
[209:17.75]What the fuck?
[209:18.31]Oh, that's sad.
[209:42.87]oh well 427 000 concurrent viewers holy that's a lot okay here are my thoughts is there an after credits like thing is it gonna be after credits like secret after credits ending
[210:16.30]Okay.
[210:17.10]No.
[210:19.20]No.
[210:19.34]Alright.
[210:21.48]Half-Life Alyx being nominated for one thing or two things and winning one of them just because it happened to be a VR game.
[210:28.27]That's upsetting.
[210:29.63]It is.
[210:30.73]But whatever.
[210:31.19]You know?
[210:31.45]Whatever.
[210:35.17]Elden Ring is vaporware.
[210:36.45]No, it's not.
[210:44.64]It's never coming out.
[210:46.38]Well, I mean, George R.R.
[210:47.56]Martin's working on it.
[210:48.46]So maybe you're right.
[210:50.26]He'll talk about it for the next 10 years.
[210:52.70]And we'll never see it.
[210:57.48]I've been waiting for the winds of winter for like seven and a half years.
[211:00.39]So.
[211:03.17]That's very possible.
[211:07.81]Alright.
[211:09.83]Yeah, I'm going to go.
[211:10.73]That's it for me.
[211:13.21]That's all I had planned.
[211:15.32]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[211:18.06]I missed the Elden Ring.
[211:20.88]I'm kind of annoyed by that, but you know, whatever.
[211:22.42]I look kind of tired today.
[211:25.30]Do I look tired?
[211:26.42]Maybe a little.
[211:30.02]That was a show, right?
[211:31.42]That was an award show.
[211:32.16]What are we doing tomorrow?
[211:39.14]What are we doing tomorrow?
[211:40.32]That's a really good question.
[211:41.68]We'll figure it out.
