[00:02.56]Ugh.
[00:05.06]I'm not gonna lie.
[00:05.72]This, uh... This coffee tastes like somebody farted in my face.
[00:21.67]I'm currently trying to get this guy to punch this lady in the face.
[00:25.03]Accidentally.
[00:25.53]He's trying to punch me in the face.
[00:27.24]I'm trying to get him to hit this old lady.
[00:28.96]And he's going to eventually.
[00:41.00]Oh, the Jermal laugh.
[00:42.14]Come on, do it again.
[00:43.99]Do it again.
[00:44.63]Knock the lady out again.
[00:46.01]Hold on.
[00:48.31]This cop... This cop is shooting him.
[01:00.12]I'm moving in.
[01:03.96]There's a guy.
[01:04.46]See you later.
[01:10.91]How did he get up here?
[01:15.18]Here come more people.
[01:16.58]Oh, there's stairs.
[01:20.80]Here comes another one.
[01:29.41]Come on, come on down.
[01:31.89]You can make it.
[01:32.63]I'm almost dead.
[01:41.75]Did you think you were going to make that?
[01:45.37]Suspect down there.
[01:47.21]Don't worry, I'm going in, boys.
[01:49.13]Cover me.
[01:49.69]It's only like a 200-foot drop.
[02:02.62]Where was it?
[02:03.96]Come down here.
[02:07.43]No, no, please.
[02:08.55]I want to get in here.
[02:11.57]No, shoot, like, the fence down for me or something.
[02:13.77]Useful.
[02:15.33]WHAT THE HECK?!
[02:23.12]I'm gonna wait.
[02:28.43]Again.
[02:32.69]What was he accomplishing by doing that?
[02:38.51]You called that guy to help protect you.
[02:41.67]That guy just gave his life to save yours.
[02:46.52]What happened?
[02:47.30]You better be grateful.
[02:50.16]I'm still clueless.
[02:53.70]Okay, let the headache pass for a second.
[02:58.04]Okay, I was...
[03:05.43]Oh my god, there's a whole bunch of... Oh my god, here they come!
[03:08.31]Oh my god, that's terrifying.
[03:12.29]This is the scariest thing ever.
[03:14.86]I'm running!
[03:15.36]No, no!
[03:16.18]Let's go, let's go.
[03:17.40]Let's get the hell out of here.
[03:18.82]Who are they shooting at?
[03:19.48]Are they shooting at me or you?
[03:20.64]They're shooting at me, probably.
[03:23.20]Why are my bodyguards not helping me?
[03:24.92]Oh, here we go.
[03:32.05]Now he's shooting at me.
[03:34.67]What are they doing?
[03:35.89]Why are your bodyguards going crazy?
[03:40.19]No, seriously, leave me alone.
[03:42.23]Are they chasing me?
[03:44.96]Jerma, you better run, because I'm coming for you.
[03:48.02]No, I was on your side.
[03:54.54]I can't go that way either.
[03:55.46]I cannot go either way.
[03:56.32]You guys are chasing me down.
[04:01.40]I think they stopped.
[04:02.06]I think they stopped.
[04:02.66]Come back.
[04:03.08]Come back.
[04:03.30]No, they didn't.
[04:03.86]They're sprinting.
[04:04.36]No, they stopped.
[04:05.00]They stopped, Jerma.
[04:06.04]They're sprinting to catch up with me.
[04:08.02]They better be.
[04:09.65]I don't trust the one in the back that's crouching.
[04:15.49]Take a screenshot.
[04:16.97]We're going to use this for my album cover.
[04:22.03]This guy back here, I don't trust him.
[04:24.33]Where?
[04:24.55]Who?
[04:25.55]The one that's sitting back here.
[04:27.04]I don't see one.
[04:28.04]He's crouched.
[04:28.84]He's permanently crouched.
[04:29.94]Oh, then one just fell.
[04:31.56]I don't know.
[04:32.71]Whatever.
[04:33.15]Let's go.
[04:33.59]I want to go make sure all these guys are dead.
[04:37.43]Like, we can't have any more unsullied on the streets.
[04:46.84]Get in.
[04:48.18]Get in quick.
[04:55.98]This is too much!
[04:59.48]You went too fast, too quick!
[05:24.48]I'm gonna die.
[05:26.96]I'm gonna die.
[05:29.18]I'm gonna die.
[05:36.22]You were just dragging around a magnet.
[05:43.20]Oh, hello, bus driver.
[05:45.29]Good to see you.
[05:46.19]How are you?
[05:46.81]Yes, please.
[05:47.57]It's a 7th and 24th Street, please.
[05:49.73]I would appreciate it if you were on the double, by the way.
[05:54.08]I have a kid's birthday party I'm going to.
[05:56.10]Oh, thank you.
[05:56.88]This is good.
[05:58.88]Oh, you know what?
[05:59.36]This looks good right here.
[06:00.36]I think I'm going to get out right at this moment.
[06:11.48]The second your character stepped out of the bus, it was all a hell.
[06:16.60]Like, everything was controlled until that moment.
[06:23.58]Like the very tip?
[06:25.00]Yes.
[06:26.10]Enjoy.
[06:26.56]I'm gonna be fine.
[06:33.29]I'm gonna land right in the water and be completely fine.
[06:37.59]Wow, that was amazing.
[06:40.68]You have to do that again.
[06:41.42]That was unbelievable.
[06:44.28]Hey, this is a good boat view.
[06:46.50]Look at the birds up there.
[06:53.95]I'm in the boat holder.
[06:55.23]It's the perfect size to be a boat holder.
[07:00.43]Yeah.
[07:00.97]Hey, let's put this up on the shelf, Ma.
[07:03.80]Okay.
[07:04.50]I'm in the boat holder.
[07:06.42]I'm gonna take my boat out today, guys.
[07:19.57]Oh, this guy's a fat fuck.
[07:23.17]Why is that?
[07:24.11]Is that like the funniest thing you've ever seen?
[07:25.85]I've never seen a guy in GTA that was like this gross.
